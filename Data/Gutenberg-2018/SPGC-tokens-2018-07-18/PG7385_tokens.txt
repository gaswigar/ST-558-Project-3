i
find
it
hard
to
sum
up
in
one
word
the
character
of
lucera
the
effect
it
produces
on
the
mind
one
sees
so
many
towns
that
the
freshness
of
their
images
becomes
blurred
the
houses
are
low
but
not
undignified
the
streets
regular
and
clean
there
is
electric
light
and
somewhat
indifferent
accommodation
for
travellers
an
infinity
of
barbers
and
chemists
nothing
remarkable
in
all
this
yet
the
character
is
there
if
one
could
but
seize
upon
it
since
every
place
has
its
genius
perhaps
it
lies
in
a
certain
feeling
of
aloofness
that
never
leaves
one
here
we
are
on
a
hill
a
mere
wave
of
ground
a
kind
of
spur
rather
rising
up
from
the
south
quite
an
absurd
little
hill
but
sufficiently
high
to
dominate
the
wide
apulian
plain
and
the
nakedness
of
the
land
stimulates
this
aerial
sense
there
are
some
trees
in
the
belvedere
or
public
garden
that
lies
on
the
highest
part
of
the
spur
and
affords
a
fine
view
north
and
eastwards
but
the
greater
part
were
only
planted
a
few
years
ago
and
those
stretches
of
brown
earth
those
walks
and
straggling
pigmy
shrubs
give
the
place
a
crude
and
embryonic
appearance
one
thinks
that
the
designers
might
have
done
more
in
the
way
of
variety
there
are
no
conifers
excepting
a
few
cryptomerias
and
yews
which
will
all
be
dead
in
a
couple
of
years
and
as
for
those
yuccas
beloved
of
italian
municipalities
they
will
have
grown
more
than
ever
none
the
less
the
garden
will
be
a
pleasant
spot
when
the
ilex
shall
have
grown
higher
even
now
it
is
the
favourite
evening
walk
of
the
citizens
altogether
these
public
parks
which
are
now
being
planted
all
over
south
italy
testify
to
renascent
taste
they
and
the
are
often
the
only
spots
where
the
deafened
and
stranger
may
find
a
little
green
content
the
content
respectively
of
and
so
the
cemetery
of
lucera
with
its
ordered
walks
drowned
in
the
shade
of
cypress
roses
and
gleaming
marble
monuments
in
between
is
a
charming
retreat
not
only
for
the
dead
the
belvedere
however
is
not
my
promenade
my
promenade
lies
yonder
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
where
the
grave
old
suabian
castle
sits
on
its
emerald
slope
it
does
not
frown
it
reposes
firmly
with
an
air
of
tranquil
and
assured
domination
it
has
found
its
place
as
an
italian
observed
to
me
long
before
frederick
barbarossa
made
it
the
centre
of
his
southern
dominions
long
before
the
romans
had
their
fortress
on
the
site
this
eminence
must
have
been
regarded
as
the
key
of
apulia
all
round
the
outside
of
those
turreted
walls
they
are
nearly
a
mile
in
circumference
the
enclosure
they
say
held
sixty
thousand
people
there
runs
a
level
space
this
is
my
promenade
at
all
hours
of
the
day
falcons
are
fluttering
with
wild
cries
overhead
down
below
a
long
unimpeded
vista
of
velvety
green
flecked
by
a
few
trees
and
sullen
streamlets
and
white
farmhouses
the
whole
vision
framed
in
a
ring
of
distant
apennines
the
volcanic
cone
of
mount
vulture
land
of
horace
can
be
detected
on
clear
days
it
tempts
me
to
explore
those
regions
but
eastward
rises
up
the
promontory
of
mount
gargano
and
on
the
summit
of
its
nearest
hill
one
perceives
a
cheerful
building
some
village
or
convent
that
beckons
imperiously
across
the
intervening
lowlands
yonder
lies
the
venerable
shrine
of
the
archangel
michael
and
manfred
town
this
castle
being
a
monument
they
have
appointed
a
custodian
to
take
charge
of
it
a
worthless
old
fellow
full
of
untruthful
information
which
he
imparts
with
the
hushed
and
air
of
a
man
who
is
selling
state
secrets
that
corner
tower
sir
is
the
king
tower
it
was
built
by
the
king
but
you
said
just
now
that
it
was
the
queen
tower
so
it
is
the
queen
she
built
it
what
queen
what
queen
why
the
queen
the
queen
the
german
professor
was
talking
about
three
years
ago
but
i
must
show
you
some
skulls
which
we
found
sotto
voce
in
a
subterranean
crypt
they
used
to
throw
the
poor
dead
folk
in
here
by
hundreds
and
under
the
bourbons
the
criminals
were
hanged
here
thousands
of
them
the
blessed
times
and
this
tower
is
the
queen
tower
but
you
called
it
the
king
tower
just
now
just
so
that
is
because
the
king
built
it
what
king
ah
sir
how
can
i
remember
the
names
of
all
those
gentlemen
i
so
much
as
set
eyes
on
them
but
i
must
now
show
you
some
round
which
we
excavated
sotto
voce
in
a
subterranean
crypt
one
or
two
relics
from
this
castle
are
preserved
in
the
small
municipal
museum
founded
about
five
years
ago
here
are
also
a
respectable
collection
of
coins
a
few
prehistoric
flints
from
gargano
some
quaint
early
bronze
figurines
and
mutilated
busts
of
roman
celebrities
carved
in
marble
or
the
recalcitrant
local
limestone
a
dignified
old
lion
one
of
a
pair
the
other
was
stolen
that
adorned
the
tomb
of
aurelius
prastor
of
the
roman
colony
of
luceria
has
sought
a
refuge
here
as
well
as
many
inscriptions
lamps
vases
and
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
modern
rubbish
a
plaster
cast
of
a
mussulman
funereal
stone
found
near
foggia
will
attract
your
eye
contrasted
with
the
fulsome
epitaphs
of
contemporary
christianity
it
breathes
a
spirit
of
noble
resignation
in
the
name
of
allah
the
merciful
the
compassionate
may
god
show
kindness
to
mahomet
and
his
kinsfolk
fostering
them
by
his
favours
this
is
the
tomb
of
the
captain
jacchia
albosasso
god
be
merciful
to
him
he
passed
away
towards
noon
on
saturday
in
the
five
days
of
the
month
moharram
of
the
year
april
may
allah
likewise
show
mercy
to
him
who
reads
one
can
not
be
at
lucera
without
thinking
of
that
colony
of
twenty
thousand
saracens
the
escort
of
frederick
and
his
son
who
lived
here
for
nearly
eighty
years
and
sheltered
manfred
in
his
hour
of
danger
the
chronicler
spinelli
footnote
these
journals
are
now
admitted
to
have
been
manufactured
in
the
sixteenth
century
by
the
historian
costanze
for
certain
genealogical
purposes
of
his
own
professor
bernhard
doubted
their
authenticity
in
and
his
doubts
have
been
confirmed
by
capasse
has
preserved
an
anecdote
which
shows
infatuation
for
these
loyal
aliens
in
the
year
and
in
the
sovereign
presence
a
saracen
official
gave
a
blow
to
a
neapolitan
knight
a
blow
which
was
immediately
returned
there
was
a
tumult
and
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
the
italian
was
condemned
to
lose
his
hand
all
that
the
neapolitan
nobles
could
obtain
from
manfred
was
that
his
left
hand
should
be
amputated
instead
of
his
right
the
arab
the
cause
of
all
was
merely
relieved
of
his
office
nowadays
all
memory
of
saracens
has
been
swept
out
of
the
land
in
default
of
anything
better
they
are
printing
a
local
halfpenny
paper
called
ii
saraceno
a
very
innocuous
pagan
to
judge
by
a
copy
which
i
bought
in
a
reckless
moment
this
museum
also
contains
a
buxom
angel
of
stucco
known
as
the
genius
of
bourbonism
in
the
good
old
days
it
used
to
ornament
the
town
hall
fronting
the
entrance
but
now
degraded
to
a
museum
curiosity
it
presents
to
the
public
its
back
of
ample
proportions
and
the
curator
intimated
that
he
considered
this
attitude
quite
appropriate
historically
speaking
of
course
furthermore
they
have
carted
hither
from
the
chamber
of
deputies
in
rome
the
chair
once
occupied
by
ruggiero
bonghi
dear
bonghi
from
a
sense
of
duty
he
used
to
visit
a
certain
dull
and
pompous
house
in
the
capital
and
forthwith
fall
asleep
on
the
nearest
sofa
he
slept
sometimes
for
two
hours
at
a
stretch
while
all
the
other
visitors
were
solemnly
marched
to
the
spot
to
observe
him
behold
the
great
bonghi
he
slumbers
there
is
a
statue
erected
to
him
here
and
a
street
has
likewise
been
named
after
another
celebrity
giovanni
bovio
if
i
informed
the
townsmen
of
my
former
acquaintance
with
these
two
heroes
they
would
perhaps
put
up
a
marble
tablet
commemorating
the
fact
for
the
place
is
infected
with
the
patriotic
disease
of
monumentomania
the
drawback
is
that
with
every
change
of
administration
the
streets
are
and
the
statues
shifted
to
make
room
for
new
favourites
so
the
civic
landmarks
come
and
go
with
the
swiftness
of
a
cinematograph
frederick
ii
also
has
his
street
and
so
has
pietjo
giannone
this
smacks
of
but
to
judge
by
the
number
of
priests
and
the
daily
hordes
of
devout
and
dirty
pilgrims
that
pour
into
the
town
from
the
fanatical
fastnesses
of
the
abruzzi
picturesque
i
suppose
we
should
call
them
the
country
is
sufficiently
orthodox
every
family
they
tell
me
has
its
pet
priest
who
lives
on
them
in
return
for
spiritual
consolations
there
was
a
religious
festival
some
nights
ago
in
honour
of
saint
espedito
no
one
could
tell
me
more
about
this
holy
man
than
that
he
was
a
kind
of
and
that
his
cult
here
is
of
recent
date
it
was
imported
or
manufactured
some
four
years
ago
by
a
rich
merchant
who
tired
of
the
old
local
saints
built
a
church
in
honour
of
this
new
one
and
thereby
enrolled
him
among
the
city
gods
on
this
occasion
the
square
was
seething
with
people
few
women
and
the
men
mostly
in
dark
clothes
we
are
already
under
moorish
and
spanish
influences
a
young
boy
addressed
me
with
the
polite
question
whether
i
could
tell
him
the
precise
number
of
the
population
of
london
that
depended
i
said
on
what
one
described
as
london
there
was
what
they
called
greater
london
it
depended
that
was
what
he
had
always
been
given
to
understand
and
how
did
i
like
lucera
rather
a
dull
little
place
was
it
not
nothing
like
paris
of
course
still
if
i
could
delay
my
departure
for
some
days
longer
they
would
have
the
trial
of
a
man
who
had
murdered
three
people
it
might
be
quite
good
fun
he
was
informed
that
they
hanged
such
persons
in
england
as
they
used
to
do
hereabouts
it
seemed
rather
barbaric
because
naturally
nobody
is
ever
responsible
for
his
actions
but
in
england
no
doubt
that
is
the
normal
attitude
of
these
folks
towards
us
and
our
institutions
we
are
savages
hopeless
savages
but
a
little
savagery
after
all
is
quite
endurable
everything
is
endurable
if
you
have
lots
of
money
like
these
english
as
for
myself
wandering
among
that
crowd
of
unshaven
creatures
that
rustic
population
fiercely
gesticulating
and
dressed
in
slovenly
hats
and
garments
i
realized
once
again
what
the
average
would
ask
himself
are
they
brigands
or
only
some
of
them
that
music
too
what
is
it
that
makes
this
stuff
so
utterly
unpalatable
to
a
civilized
northerner
a
soulless
cult
of
rhythm
and
then
when
the
simplest
of
melodies
emerges
they
cling
to
it
with
the
passionate
delight
of
a
child
who
has
discovered
the
moon
these
men
are
still
in
the
age
of
platitudes
so
far
as
music
is
concerned
an
infantile
aria
is
to
them
what
some
foolish
rhymed
proverb
is
to
the
arabs
a
thing
of
god
a
portent
a
joy
for
ever
you
may
visit
the
cathedral
there
is
a
fine
column
on
either
side
of
the
sumptuous
main
portal
i
am
weary
just
now
of
these
structures
the
spirit
of
pagan
lucera
lucera
dei
pagani
it
used
to
be
called
has
descended
upon
me
i
feel
inclined
to
echo
nume
semitico
one
sees
so
many
of
these
sombre
churches
and
they
are
all
alike
in
their
stony
elaboration
of
mysticism
and
besides
they
have
been
described
over
and
over
again
by
enthusiastic
connaisseurs
who
dwell
lovingly
upon
their
artistic
quaintnesses
but
forget
the
grovelling
herd
that
reared
them
with
the
lash
at
their
backs
or
the
odd
type
of
humanity
the
gargoyle
type
that
has
since
grown
up
under
their
shadow
and
influence
i
prefer
to
return
to
the
sun
and
stars
to
my
promenade
beside
the
castle
walls
but
for
the
absence
of
trees
and
hedges
one
might
take
this
to
be
some
english
prospect
of
the
drowsy
midland
counties
so
green
it
is
so
the
sky
the
sunlight
peers
down
dispersedly
through
windows
in
this
firmament
of
clouded
amber
alighting
on
some
mouldering
tower
some
patch
of
ripening
corn
or
distant
city
troia
lapped
in
byzantine
slumber
or
san
severo
famed
in
war
this
in
spring
but
what
days
of
glistering
summer
heat
when
the
earth
is
burnt
to
cinders
under
a
heavenly
dome
that
glows
like
a
brazier
of
molten
copper
for
this
country
is
the
sahara
of
italy
one
is
glad
meanwhile
that
the
castle
does
not
lie
in
the
natal
land
of
the
hohenstaufen
the
interior
is
quite
deserted
to
be
sure
they
have
built
half
the
town
of
lucera
with
its
stones
even
as
frederick
quarried
them
out
of
the
early
roman
citadel
beneath
but
it
is
at
least
a
harmonious
desolation
there
are
no
walks
among
the
ruins
no
and
cheap
reconstructions
of
and
at
every
corner
no
gaudy
women
scribbling
to
their
friends
in
the
residenzstadt
post
cards
illustrative
of
the
burgruine
while
their
husbands
perspire
over
mastodontic
there
is
only
peace
these
are
the
delights
of
lucera
to
sit
under
those
old
walls
and
watch
the
gracious
dappling
the
plain
oblivious
of
yonder
assemblage
of
barbers
and
politicians
as
for
those
who
can
reconstruct
the
vanished
glories
of
such
a
place
happy
they
i
find
the
task
increasingly
difficult
one
outgrows
the
youthful
age
of
next
our
really
keen
edges
are
so
soon
worn
off
by
mundane
trivialities
and
vexations
that
one
is
glad
to
take
refuge
in
simpler
pleasures
once
more
to
return
to
primitive
emotionalism
there
are
so
many
emperors
of
past
days
and
like
the
old
custodian
i
have
not
so
much
as
set
eyes
on
them
yet
this
frederick
is
no
dim
figure
he
looms
grandly
through
the
intervening
haze
how
well
one
understands
that
craving
for
the
east
nowadays
how
modern
they
were
he
and
his
son
the
sultan
of
lucera
and
their
friends
and
counsellors
who
planted
this
garden
of
exotic
culture
was
it
some
afterglow
of
the
luminous
world
that
had
sunk
below
the
horizon
or
a
pale
streak
of
the
coming
dawn
and
if
you
now
glance
down
into
this
enclosure
that
once
echoed
with
the
song
of
minstrels
and
the
soft
laughter
of
women
with
the
discourse
of
wits
artists
and
philosophers
and
the
clang
of
arms
if
you
look
you
will
behold
nothing
but
a
green
lake
a
waving
field
of
grass
no
matter
the
ambitions
of
these
men
are
fairly
realized
and
every
one
of
us
may
keep
a
of
pagans
a
please
him
and
a
harem
likewise
to
judge
by
the
newspapers
for
he
took
his
orientalism
seriously
he
had

matthew

relates
how
frederick
returning
from
the
holy
land
rested
awhile
at
his
italian
court
and
saw
among
other
diversions

i
wish
i
had
been
there
i
walked
to
the
castle
yesterday
evening
on
the
chance
of
seeing
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
which
never
came
having
taken
place
at
quite
another
hour
a
cloudless
night
dripping
with
moisture
the
electric
lights
of
distant
foggia
gleaming
in
the
plain
there
are
at
the
foot
of
the
incline
and
from
some
pools
in
the
neighbourhood
issued
a
loud
croaking
of
frogs
while
the
pallid
smoke
of
the
furnaces
pressed
down
by
the
evening
dew
trailed
earthward
in
a
long
twisted
wreath
like
a
dragon
crawling
sulkily
to
his
den
but
on
the
north
side
one
could
hear
the
nightingales
singing
in
the
gardens
below
the
dark
mass
of
mount
gargano
rose
up
clearly
in
the
moonlight
and
i
began
to
sketch
out
some
itinerary
of
my
wanderings
on
that
soil
there
was
angelo
the
archangel
abode
and
the
forest
region
and
lesina
with
its
lake
and
vieste
the
remote
the
end
of
all
things
then
my
thoughts
wandered
to
the
hohenstaufen
and
the
conspiracy
whereby
their
fate
was
avenged
the
romantic
figures
of
manfred
and
conradin
their
relentless
enemy
charles
costanza
her
brow
crowned
with
a
poetic
nimbus
that
melted
towards
the
end
into
an
aureole
of
bigotry
frangipani
huge
in
villainy
the
princess
beatrix
tottering
from
the
dungeon
where
she
had
been
confined
for
nearly
twenty
years
her
deliverer
roger
de
lauria
without
whose
resourcefulness
and
audacity
it
might
have
gone
ill
with
aragon
popes
and
brilliant
colour
effects
the
king
of
england
and
saint
louis
of
france
in
the
background
dimly
discernible
the
colossal
shades
of
frederick
and
innocent
looked
in
deadly
embrace
and
the
whole
congress
of
figures
enlivened
and
interpenetrated
as
by
some
electric
fluid
the
personality
of
john
of
procida
that
the
element
of
farce
might
not
be
lacking
fate
contrived
that
exquisite
royal
duel
at
bordeaux
where
the
two
mighty
potentates
calling
each
other
by
a
variety
of
unkingly
epithets
enacted
a
prodigiously
fine
piece
of
foolery
for
the
delectation
of
europe
from
this
terrace
one
can
overlook
both
foggia
and
castel
fiorentino
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
drama
and
one
follows
the
march
of
this
magnificent
retribution
without
a
shred
of
compassion
for
the
gloomy
papal
hireling
disaster
follows
disaster
with
mathematical
precision
till
at
last
he
perishes
miserably
consumed
by
rage
and
despair
then
our
satisfaction
is
complete
no
not
quite
complete
for
in
one
point
the
stupendous
plot
seems
to
have
been
imperfectly
achieved
why
did
roger
de
lauria
not
profit
by
his
victory
to
insist
upon
the
restitution
of
the
young
brothers
of
beatrix
of
those
unhappy
princes
who
had
been
confined
as
infants
in
and
whose
very
existence
seems
to
have
faded
from
the
memory
of
historians
or
why
did
costanza
who
might
have
dealt
with
her
son
even
as
conradin
had
been
dealt
with
not
round
her
magnanimity
by
claiming
her
own
flesh
and
blood
the
last
scions
of
a
great
house
why
were
they
not
released
during
the
subsequent
peace
or
at
least
in
the
reason
is
as
plain
as
it
is
unlovely
nobody
knew
what
to
do
with
them
political
reasons
counselled
their
effacement
their
horrible
thought
that
the
sunny
world
should
be
too
small
for
three
orphan
children
in
their
apulian
fastness
they
remained
in
chains
a
royal
rescript
of
orders
that
they
be
freed
from
their
fetters
thirty
years
in
fetters
their
fate
is
unknown
the
night
of
medievalism
closes
in
upon
them
once
more
further
musings
were
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
a
shape
which
approached
from
round
the
corner
of
one
of
the
towers
it
cams
nearer
stealthily
pausing
every
now
and
then
had
i
evoked
some
phantom
of
the
buried
past
it
was
only
the
custodian
leading
his
dog
musolino
after
a
shower
of
compliments
and
apologies
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
it
was
his
duty
among
other
things
to
see
that
no
one
should
endeavour
to
raise
the
treasure
which
was
hidden
under
these
ruins
several
people
he
explained
had
already
made
the
attempt
by
night
for
the
rest
i
was
quite
at
liberty
to
take
my
pleisure
about
the
castle
at
all
hours
but
as
to
touching
the
buried
hoard
it
was
forbidden
i
was
glad
of
the
incident
which
conjured
up
for
me
the
oriental
mood
with
its
genii
and
subterranean
wealth
straightway
this
incongruous
and
irresponsible
old
buffoon
was
invested
with
a
new
dignity
transformed
into
a
threatening
ifrit
the
guardian
of
the
gold
or
who
knows
iblis
incarnate
the
gods
take
wondrous
shapes
sometimes
ii
manfred
town
as
the
train
moved
from
lucera
to
foggia
and
thence
onwards
i
had
enjoyed
myself
rationally
gazing
at
the
emerald
plain
of
apulia
soon
to
be
scorched
to
ashes
but
now
richly
dight
with
the
yellow
flowers
of
the
giant
fennel
with
patches
of
poppy
and
asphodels
pale
and
shadowy
past
their
prime
i
had
thought
upon
the
history
of
this
immense
tract
of
country
upon
all
the
floods
of
legislation
and
theorizings
to
which
its
immemorial
customs
of
pasturage
have
given
birth
then
suddenly
the
aspect
of
life
seemed
to
change
i
felt
unwell
and
so
swift
was
the
transition
from
health
that
i
had
wantonly
thrown
out
of
the
window
beyond
recall
a
burning
cigar
ere
realizing
that
it
was
only
a
little
more
than
half
smoked
we
were
crossing
the
calendaro
a
sluggish
stream
which
carefully
collects
all
the
waters
of
this
region
only
to
lose
them
again
in
a
swamp
not
far
distant
and
it
was
positively
as
if
some
impish
sprite
had
leapt
out
of
those
noisome
waves
boarded
the
train
and
flung
himself
into
me
after
the
fashion
of
the
horla
in
the
immortal
tale
doses
of
quinine
such
as
would
make
an
english
doctor
raise
his
eyebrows
have
hitherto
only
succeeded
in
provoking
the
calendaro
microbe
to
more
virulent
activity
nevertheless
i
am
studying
him
and
despite
his
protean
manifestations
have
discovered
three
principal
ingredients
malaria
bronchitis
and
not
your
ordinary
oh
no
but
such
as
a
mammoth
might
conceivably
catch
if
thrust
back
from
his
germless
frozen
tundras
into
the
damply
blossoming
miocene
the
landlady
of
this
establishment
has
a
more
commonplace
name
for
the
distemper
she
calls
it
scirocco
and
certainly
this
pest
of
the
south
blows
incessantly
the
of
gargano
is
veiled
the
horizon
veiled
the
of
apulia
veiled
by
its
tepid
and
unwholesome
breath
to
cheer
me
up
she
says
that
on
clear
days
one
can
see
castel
del
monte
the
hohenstaufen
eyrie
shining
yonder
above
barletta
forty
miles
distant
it
sounds
rather
improbable
still
yesterday
evening
there
arose
a
sudden
vision
of
a
white
town
in
that
direction
remote
and
far
across
the
water
was
it
barletta
or
margherita
it
lingered
awhile
poised
on
an
errant
sunbeam
then
sank
into
the
deep
from
this
window
i
look
into
the
little
harbour
whose
beach
is
dotted
with
some
twenty
or
thirty
are
riding
at
anchor
in
the
early
morning
they
unfurl
their
canvas
and
sally
forth
in
amicable
couples
to
scour
the
azure
deep
it
is
at
this
moment
returning
at
nightfall
with
the
spoils
of
ocean
mostly
young
sharks
to
judge
by
the
display
in
the
market
their
white
sails
bear
fabulous
devices
in
golden
colour
of
moons
and
crescents
and
dolphins
some
are
marked
like
the
butterfly
a
gunboat
is
now
stationed
here
on
a
mysterious
errand
connected
with
the
albanian
rising
on
the
other
side
of
the
adriatic
there
has
been
whispered
talk
of
illicit
volunteering
among
the
youth
on
this
side
which
the
government
is
anxious
to
prevent
and
to
enliven
the
scene
a
steamer
calls
every
now
and
then
to
take
passengers
to
the
tremiti
islands
one
would
like
to
visit
them
if
only
in
memory
of
those
martyrs
of
bourbonism
who
were
sent
in
hundreds
to
these
rocks
and
cast
into
dungeons
to
perish
i
have
seen
such
places
they
are
vast
caverns
artificially
excavated
below
the
surface
of
the
earth
into
these
the
unfortunates
were
lowered
and
left
to
crawl
about
and
rot
the
living
mingled
with
the
dead
to
this
day
they
find
mouldering
skeletons
loaded
with
heavy
iron
chains
and
a
copious
spring
gushes
up
on
this
beach
and
flows
into
the
sea
it
is
sadly
neglected
were
i
tyrant
of
manfredonia
i
would
build
me
a
fair
marble
fountain
here
with
a
carven
assemblage
of
nymphs
and
spouting
water
from
their
lusty
throats
and
plashing
in
its
rivulets
it
may
well
be
that
the
existence
of
this
fount
helped
to
decide
manfred
in
his
choice
of
a
site
for
his
city
such
springs
are
rare
in
this
waterless
land
and
from
this
same
source
very
likely
is
derived
the
local
legend
of
saint
lorenzo
and
the
dragon
which
is
quite
independent
of
that
of
saint
michael
the
on
the
heights
above
us
these
venerable
these
are
interesting
beasts
who
went
through
many
metamorphoses
ere
attaining
their
present
shape
manfredonia
lies
on
a
plain
sloping
very
gently
seawards
practically
a
dead
level
and
in
one
of
the
hottest
districts
of
italy
yet
for
some
obscure
reason
there
is
no
street
along
the
sea
itself
the
end
in
abrupt
squalor
at
the
shore
one
wonders
what
considerations
political
aesthetic
or
hygienic
prevented
the
designers
of
the
town
from
carrying
out
its
general
principles
of
construction
and
building
a
decent
promenade
by
the
waves
where
the
ten
thousand
citizens
could
take
the
air
in
the
breathless
summer
evenings
instead
of
being
cooped
up
as
they
now
are
within
stifling
hot
walls
the
choice
of
as
a
port
does
not
testify
to
any
great
foresight
on
the
part
of
its
founder
peace
to
his
shade
it
will
for
ever
slumber
in
its
bay
while
commerce
passes
beyond
its
reach
it
will
for
ever
be
malarious
with
the
marshes
of
sipontum
at
its
edges
but
this
particular
defect
of
the
place
is
not
manfred
fault
since
the
city
was
razed
to
the
ground
by
the
turks
in
and
then
built
up
anew
built
up
says
lenormant
according
to
the
design
of
the
old
city
perhaps
a
fear
of
other
corsair
raids
induced
the
constructors
to
adhere
to
the
old
plan
by
which
the
place
could
be
more
easily
defended
not
much
of
seems
to
have
been
completed
when
view
was
engraved
speaking
of
the
weather
the
landlady
further
told
me
that
the
wind
blew
so
hard
three
months
ago
during
that
big
storm
in
the
winter
you
remember
that
it
broke
all
the
iron
between
the
town
and
the
station
now
here
was
a
statement
sounding
even
more
improbable
than
her
other
one
about
castel
del
monte
but
admitting
of
verification
wheezing
and
sneezing
i
crawled
forth
and
found
it
correct
it
must
have
been
a
respectable
gale
since
the
supports
are
snapped
in
half
every
one
of
them
those
turks
by
the
way
burnt
the
town
on
that
memorable
occasion
that
was
a
common
occurrence
in
those
days
read
any
account
of
their
incursions
into
italy
during
this
and
the
preceding
centuries
and
you
will
find
that
the
corsairs
burnt
the
towns
whenever
they
had
time
to
set
them
alight
they
could
not
burn
them
nowadays
and
this
points
to
a
total
change
in
economic
conditions
wood
was
cut
down
so
heedlessly
that
it
became
too
scarce
for
building
purposes
and
stone
took
its
place
this
has
altered
domestic
architecture
it
has
changed
the
landscape
denuding
the
that
were
once
covered
with
timber
it
has
impoverished
the
country
by
converting
fruitful
plains
into
marshes
or
arid
tracts
of
stone
swept
by
irregular
and
intermittent
floods
it
has
modified
if
i
mistake
not
the
very
character
of
the
people
the
desiccation
of
the
climate
has
entailed
a
desiccation
of
national
humour
muratori
has
a
passage
somewhere
in
his
antiquities
regarding
the
old
method
of
construction
and
the
wooden
shingles
in
use
for
roofing
i
must
look
it
up
if
ever
i
reach
civilized
regions
again
at
the
municipality
which
occupies
the
spacious
apartments
of
a
former
dominican
convent
they
will
show
you
the
picture
of
a
young
girl
one
of
the
beccarmi
family
who
was
carried
off
at
a
tender
age
in
one
of
these
turkish
raids
and
subsequently
became
sultana
such
captive
girls
generally
married
sultans
or
ought
to
have
married
them
the
wish
being
father
to
the
thought
but
the
story
is
disputed
rightly
i
think
for
the
portrait
is
painted
in
the
french
manner
and
it
is
hardly
likely
that
a
would
have
been
exhibited
to
a
european
artist
the
legend
goes
on
to
say
that
she
was
afterwards
liberated
by
the
knights
of
malta
together
with
her
turkish
son
who
as
was
meet
and
proper
became
converted
to
christianity
and
died
a
monk
the
beccarmi
family
of
siena
i
fancy
might
find
some
traces
of
her
in
their
archives
trovato
at
all
events
when
one
looks
at
the
pretty
portrait
one
can
not
blame
any
kind
of
sultan
for
feeling
towards
the
original
the
weather
has
shown
some
signs
of
improvement
and
tempted
me
despite
the
persistent
scirocco
mood
to
a
few
excursions
into
the
neighbourhood
but
there
seem
to
be
no
walks
hereabouts
and
the
hills
three
miles
distant
are
too
remote
for
my
reduced
vitality
the
intervening
region
is
a
plain
of
rock
carved
so
smoothly
in
places
as
to
appear
artificially
levelled
with
the
chisel
large
tracts
of
it
are
covered
with
the
indian
fig
cactus
in
the
shade
of
these
grotesque
growths
lives
a
dainty
flora
trembling
grasses
of
many
kinds
rue
asphodel
thyme
the
wild
asparagus
a
diminutive
blue
iris
as
well
as
patches
of
saxifrage
that
deck
the
stone
with
a
brilliant
enamel
of
red
and
yellow
this
wild
beauty
makes
one
think
how
much
better
the
graceful
balconies
of
the
town
would
look
if
enlivened
with
blossoms
with
pendent
carnations
or
pelargonium
but
there
is
no
great
display
of
these
things
the
deficiency
of
water
is
a
characteristic
of
the
place
it
is
a
flowerless
and
songless
city
the
only
good
is
that
which
is
bottled
at
the
mineral
springs
of
monte
vulture
and
sold
cheaply
enough
all
over
the
country
and
the
mass
of
the
country
people
have
small
charm
of
feature
their
faces
seem
to
have
been
chopped
with
a
hatchet
into
masks
of
sombre
virility
a
hard
life
amid
burning
limestone
deserts
is
reflected
in
their
countenances
none
the
less
they
have
a
public
garden
even
more
immature
than
that
of
lucera
but
testifying
to
greater
taste
its
situation
covering
a
forlorn
semicircular
tract
of
ground
about
the
old
anjou
castle
is
a
good
one
but
when
the
trees
are
fully
grown
it
will
be
impossible
to
see
this
fine
ruin
save
at
quite
close
quarters
just
across
the
moat
i
lamented
this
fact
to
a
solitary
gentleman
who
was
strolling
about
here
and
who
replied
upon
due
deliberation
one
can
not
have
everything
then
he
added
as
a
suggestive
afterthought
inasmuch
as
one
thing
sometimes
excludes
another
i
pause
to
observe
parenthetically
that
this
habit
of
uttering
platitudes
in
the
grand
manner
as
though
disclosing
an
idea
of
vital
novelty
which
charles
lamb
poor
fellow
thought
peculiar
to
natives
of
scotland
is
as
common
among
italians
as
among
englishmen
but
veiled
in
sonorous
latinisms
the
staleness
of
such
remarks
assumes
an
air
of
profundity
for
my
part
he
went
on
warming
to
his
theme
i
am
thoroughly
satisfied
who
will
complain
of
the
trees
only
a
few
makers
of
bad
pictures
they
can
go
elsewhere
our
country
dear
sir
is
with
old
castles
and
other
feudal
absurdities
and
if
i
had
the
management
of
things
the
sentence
was
not
concluded
for
at
that
moment
his
hat
was
blown
off
by
a
violent
gust
of
wind
and
flew
merrily
over
beds
of
flowering
marguerites
in
the
direction
of
the
main
street
while
he
raced
after
it
vanishing
in
a
cloud
of
dust
the
chase
must
have
been
long
and
arduous
he
never
returned
wandering
about
the
upper
regions
of
this
fortress
whose
chambers
are
now
used
as
a
factory
of
cement
goods
and
a
refuge
for
some
poor
families
i
espied
a
good
relief
of
saint
michael
and
the
dragon
immured
in
the
masonry
and
overhung
by
the
green
leaves
of
an
exuberant
wild
fig
that
has
thrust
its
roots
into
the
sturdy
old
walls
here
at
manfredonia
we
are
already
under
the
shadow
of
the
holy
mountain
and
the
archangel
wings
but
the
usual
representations
of
him
are
childishly
emasculate
the
negation
of
his
divine
and
heroic
character
this
one
portrays
a
genuine
of
the
old
type
grave
and
grim
beyond
this
castle
and
the
which
are
best
preserved
on
the
north
side
nothing
in
manfredonia
is
older
than
there
is
a
fine
but
the
cathedral
looks
like
a
shed
for
disused
omnibuses
along
the
streets
little
red
flags
are
hanging
out
of
the
houses
at
frequent
intervals
signals
of
harbourage
for
the
parched
wayfarer
within
you
behold
a
picturesque
confusion
of
rude
chairs
set
among
barrels
and
vats
full
of
dark
red
wine
where
amid
rembrandtesque
surroundings
you
can
get
as
drunk
as
a
lord
for
sixpence
blithe
oases
it
must
be
delightful
in
summer
to
while
away
the
sultry
hours
in
their
hospitable
twilight
even
at
this
season
they
seem
to
be
extremely
popular
resorts
throwing
a
new
light
on
those
allusions
by
classical
authors
to
thirsty
apulia
but
on
many
of
the
dwellings
i
noticed
another
symbol
an
ominous
blue
metal
tablet
with
a
red
cross
bearing
the
words
vigilanza
notturna
was
it
some
association
i
enquired
of
a
individual
who
happened
to
be
passing
his
answer
did
not
help
to
clear
up
matters
a
pure
job
a
pure
job
there
is
a
society
in
cerignola
or
somewhere
a
society
which
persuades
the
various
town
councils
them
you
understand
he
ended
abruptly
with
the
gesture
of
paying
out
money
between
his
finger
and
thumb
then
he
sadly
shook
his
head
i
sought
for
more
light
on
this
cryptic
utterance
in
vain
what
were
the
facts
i
persisted
did
certain
householders
subscribe
to
keep
a
guardian
on
their
premises
at
night
what
had
the
municipalities
to
do
with
it
was
there
much
in
manfredonia
and
if
so
had
this
association
done
anything
to
check
it
and
for
how
long
had
the
institution
been
established
but
the
mystery
grew
ever
darker
after
heaving
a
deep
sigh
he
condescended
to
remark
the
usual
camorra
eat
eat
from
father
to
son
eat
eat
that
all
they
think
about
the
brood
of
assassins
just
look
at
them
i
glanced
down
the
street
and
beheld
a
venerable
gentleman
of
kindly
aspect
who
approached
slowly
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
youth
his
grandson
i
supposed
he
wore
a
long
white
beard
and
an
air
of
apostolic
detachment
from
the
affairs
of
this
world
they
came
nearer
the
boy
was
listening
deferentially
to
some
remark
of
the
elder
his
lips
were
parted
in
attention
and
his
candid
sunny
face
would
have
rejoiced
the
heart
of
della
robbia
they
passed
within
a
few
feet
of
me
lovingly
engrossed
in
one
another
well
i
queried
turning
to
my
informant
and
anxious
to
learn
what
misdeeds
could
be
laid
to
the
charge
of
such
godlike
types
of
humanity
but
that
person
was
no
longer
at
my
side
he
had
quietly
withdrawn
himself
in
the
interval
he
had
evanesced
moved
on
an
oracular
and
elusive
citizen
iii
the
angel
of
manfredonia
whoever
looks
at
a
map
of
the
gargano
promontory
will
see
that
it
is
besprinkled
with
greek
names
of
persons
and
places
matthew
mark
nikander
onofrius
pirgiano
pyrgos
and
so
forth
small
wonder
for
these
eastern
regions
were
in
touch
with
constantinople
from
early
days
and
the
spirit
of
byzance
still
hovers
over
them
it
was
on
this
mountain
that
the
archangel
michael
during
his
first
flight
to
western
europe
deigned
to
appear
to
a
greek
bishop
of
sipontum
laurentius
by
name
and
ever
since
that
time
a
certain
cavern
sanctified
by
the
presence
of
this
winged
messenger
of
god
has
been
the
goal
of
millions
of
pilgrims
the
fastness
of
sant
angelo
metropolis
of
european
has
grown
up
around
this
devout
and
honourable
cave
on
sunny
days
its
houses
are
clearly
visible
from
they
who
wish
to
pay
their
devotions
at
the
shrine
can
not
do
better
than
take
with
them
gregorovius
as
cicerone
and
mystagogue
vainly
i
waited
for
a
fine
day
to
ascend
the
heights
at
last
i
determined
to
have
done
with
the
trip
be
the
weather
what
it
might
a
coachman
was
summoned
and
negotiations
entered
upon
for
starting
next
morning
francs
he
began
by
telling
me
was
the
price
paid
by
an
englishman
last
year
for
a
day
visit
to
the
sacred
mountain
it
may
well
be
true
foreigners
will
do
anything
in
italy
or
perhaps
it
was
only
said
to
encourage
me
but
i
am
rather
hard
to
encourage
nowadays
i
reminded
the
man
that
there
was
a
diligence
service
there
and
back
for
a
franc
and
a
half
and
even
that
price
seemed
rather
extortionate
i
had
seen
so
many
holy
grottos
in
my
life
and
who
after
all
was
this
saint
michael
the
eternal
father
perchance
nothing
of
the
kind
just
an
ordinary
angel
we
had
dozens
of
them
in
england
fortunately
i
added
i
had
already
received
an
offer
to
join
one
of
the
private
parties
who
drive
up
fourteen
or
fifteen
persons
behind
one
diminutive
pony
and
that
as
he
well
knew
would
be
a
matter
of
only
a
few
pence
and
even
then
the
threatening
sky
yes
on
second
thoughts
it
was
perhaps
wisest
to
postpone
the
excursion
altogether
another
day
if
god
wills
would
he
accept
this
cigar
as
a
recompense
for
his
trouble
in
coming
in
dizzy
leaps
and
bounds
his
claims
fell
to
eight
francs
it
was
the
tobacco
that
worked
the
wonder
a
gentleman
who
will
give
for
such
was
his
logic
well
you
never
know
what
you
may
not
get
out
of
him
agree
to
his
price
and
chance
it
he
consigned
the
cigar
to
his
waistcoat
pocket
to
smoke
after
dinner
and
departed
vanquished
but
inwardly
beaming
with
bright
anticipation
a
wretched
morning
was
disclosed
as
i
drew
open
the
shutters
gusts
of
rain
and
sleet
beating
against
the
no
matter
the
carriage
stood
below
and
after
that
customary
and
hateful
apology
for
breakfast
which
suffices
to
turn
the
thoughts
of
the
sanest
man
towards
themes
of
suicide
and
murder
when
will
southerners
learn
to
eat
a
proper
breakfast
at
proper
hours
we
started
on
our
journey
the
sun
came
out
in
visions
of
tantalizing
briefness
only
to
be
swallowed
up
again
in
driving
murk
and
of
the
route
we
traversed
i
noticed
only
the
old
stony
track
that
cuts
across
the
windings
of
the
new
here
and
there
i
tried
to
picture
to
myself
the
norman
princes
the
emperors
popes
and
other
ten
thousand
pilgrims
of
celebrity
crawling
up
these
rocky
slopes
barefoot
on
such
a
day
as
this
it
must
have
tried
the
patience
even
of
saint
francis
of
assisi
who
pilgrimaged
with
the
rest
of
them
and
according
to
pontanus
performed
a
little
miracle
here
passant
as
was
his
wont
after
about
three
hours
driving
we
reached
the
town
of
sant
angelo
it
was
bitterly
cold
at
this
elevation
of
metres
acting
on
the
advice
of
the
coachman
i
at
once
descended
into
the
sanctuary
it
would
be
warm
down
there
he
thought
the
great
festival
of
may
was
over
but
flocks
of
worshippers
were
still
arriving
and
picturesquely
pagan
they
looked
in
grimy
tattered
garments
their
staves
tipped
with
and
a
scrip
in
the
massive
bronze
doors
of
the
chapel
that
were
made
at
constantinople
in
for
a
rich
citizen
of
amalfi
metal
rings
are
inserted
these
like
a
true
pilgrim
you
must
clash
furiously
to
call
the
attention
of
the
powers
within
to
your
visit
and
on
issuing
you
must
once
more
knock
as
hard
as
you
can
in
order
that
the
consummation
of
your
act
of
worship
may
be
duly
reported
judging
by
the
noise
made
the
deity
must
be
very
hard
of
hearing
strangely
deaf
they
are
sometimes
the
panels
of
these
doors
are
naively
encrusted
with
representations
in
enamel
of
of
many
kinds
some
of
them
are
inscribed
and
the
following
is
worthy
of
note
i
beg
and
implore
the
priests
of
saint
michael
to
cleanse
these
gates
once
a
year
as
i
have
now
shown
them
in
order
that
they
may
be
always
bright
and
shining
the
recommendation
has
plainly
not
been
carried
out
for
a
good
many
years
past
having
entered
the
portal
you
climb
down
a
long
stairway
amid
swarms
of
pious
foul
clustering
beggars
to
a
vast
cavern
the
archangel
abode
it
is
a
natural
recess
in
the
rock
illuminated
by
candles
here
divine
service
is
proceeding
to
the
accompaniment
of
cheerful
operatic
airs
from
an
asthmatic
organ
the
water
drops
ceaselessly
from
the
rocky
vault
on
to
the
devout
heads
of
kneeling
worshippers
that
cover
the
floor
lighted
candle
in
hand
rocking
themselves
ecstatically
and
droning
and
chanting
a
weird
scene
in
truth
and
the
coachman
was
quite
right
in
his
surmise
as
to
the
difference
in
temperature
it
is
hot
down
here
damply
hot
as
in
an
but
the
aroma
can
not
be
described
as
a
floral
emanation
it
is
the
rather
of
thirteen
centuries
of
unwashed
and
perspiring
pilgrims
terribilis
est
locus
iste
says
an
inscription
over
the
entrance
of
the
shrine
very
true
in
places
like
this
one
understands
the
uses
and
possibly
the
origin
of
incense
i
lingered
none
the
less
and
my
thoughts
went
back
to
the
east
whence
these
mysterious
practices
are
derived
but
an
oriental
crowd
of
worshippers
does
not
move
me
like
these
european
masses
of
fanaticism
i
can
never
bring
myself
to
regard
without
a
certain
amount
of
disquietude
such
passionate
pilgrims
give
them
their
new
messiah
and
all
our
painfully
accumulated
art
and
knowledge
all
that
reconciles
civilized
man
to
earthly
existence
is
blown
to
the
winds
society
can
deal
with
its
criminals
not
they
but
fond
enthusiasts
such
as
these
are
the
menace
to
its
stability
bitter
reflections
but
then
the
drive
upward
had
chilled
my
human
sympathies
and
besides
that
breakfast
the
grovelling
herd
was
left
behind
i
ascended
the
stairs
and
profiting
by
a
gleam
of
sunshine
climbed
up
to
where
above
the
town
there
stands
a
proud
aerial
ruin
known
as
the
castle
of
the
giant
on
one
of
its
stones
is
inscribed
the
date
a
certain
queen
of
naples
they
say
was
murdered
within
those
now
crumbling
walls
these
sovereigns
were
murdered
in
so
many
castles
that
one
wonders
how
they
ever
found
time
to
be
alive
at
all
the
structure
is
a
wreck
and
its
gateway
closed
up
nor
did
i
feel
any
great
inclination
in
that
icy
blast
of
wind
to
investigate
the
roofless
interior
i
was
able
to
observe
however
that
this
feudal
absurdity
bears
a
number
like
any
inhabited
house
of
sant
angelo
it
is
no
this
is
the
latest
pastime
of
the
italian
government
to
dwellings
throughout
the
kingdom
and
not
only
human
habitations
but
walls
old
ruins
stables
churches
as
well
as
an
occasional
and
window
they
are
having
no
end
of
fun
over
the
game
which
promises
to
keep
them
amused
for
any
length
of
time
in
fact
until
the
next
craze
is
invented
meanwhile
so
long
as
the
fit
lasts
half
a
million
officials
burning
with
youthful
ardour
are
employed
in
affixing
these
numerals
briskly
entering
them
into
ten
times
as
many
and
registering
them
into
thousands
of
municipal
archives
all
over
the
country
for
some
inscrutable
but
hugely
important
administrative
purposes
we
have
the
employes
as
a
roman
deputy
once
told
me
and
therefore
they
must
find
some
occupation
altogether
the
weather
this
day
sadly
impaired
my
appetite
for
research
and
exploration
on
the
way
to
the
castle
i
had
occasion
to
admire
the
fine
tower
and
to
regret
that
there
seemed
to
exist
no
coign
of
vantage
from
which
it
could
fairly
be
viewed
i
was
struck
also
by
the
number
of
small
figures
of
saint
michael
of
an
almost
infantile
type
and
lastly
by
certain
old
men
of
the
place
these
venerable
and
decorative
brigands
for
such
they
would
have
been
a
few
years
ago
now
stood
peacefully
at
their
thresholds
wearing
a
most
becoming
cloak
of
thick
brown
wool
shaped
like
a
burnous
the
garment
interested
me
it
may
be
a
legacy
from
the
arabs
who
dominated
this
region
for
some
little
time
despoiling
the
holy
sanctuary
and
leaving
their
memory
to
be
perpetuated
by
the
neighbouring
monte
saraceno
the
costume
on
the
other
hand
may
have
come
over
from
greece
it
is
figured
on
tanagra
statuettes
and
worn
by
modern
greek
shepherds
by
sardinians
too
it
may
well
be
a
primordial
form
of
clothing
with
mankind
the
view
from
this
castle
must
be
superb
on
clear
days
standing
there
i
looked
inland
and
remembered
all
the
places
i
had
intended
to
see
vieste
and
lesina
with
its
lakes
and
selva
umbra
whose
very
name
is
suggestive
of
dewy
glades
how
remote
they
were
under
such
dispiriting
clouds
i
shall
never
see
them
spring
hesitates
to
smile
upon
these
chill
uplands
we
are
still
in
the
grip
of
winter
aut
aquilonibus
querceti
gargani
laborent
et
foliis
viduantur
orni
so
sang
old
horace
of
garganian
winds
i
scanned
the
horizon
seeking
for
his
mount
vulture
but
all
that
region
was
enshrouded
in
a
grey
curtain
of
vapour
only
the
stagno
salso
a
salt
mere
wherein
candelaro
forgets
his
mephitic
waters
shone
with
a
steady
glow
like
a
sheet
of
polished
lead
soon
the
rain
fell
once
more
and
drove
me
to
seek
refuge
among
the
houses
where
i
glimpsed
the
familiar
figure
of
my
coachman
sitting
disconsolately
under
a
porch
he
looked
up
and
remarked
for
want
of
something
better
to
say
that
he
had
been
searching
for
me
all
over
the
town
fearing
that
some
mischief
might
have
happened
to
me
i
was
touched
by
these
words
touched
that
is
by
his
simplicity
in
imagining
that
he
could
bring
me
to
believe
a
statement
of
such
radiant
improbability
so
touched
that
i
pressed
a
franc
into
his
reluctant
palm
and
bade
him
buy
with
it
something
to
eat
a
whole
franc
he
doubtless
thought
theory
of
the
gentleman
it
begins
to
it
was
barely
midday
yet
i
was
already
surfeited
with
the
angelic
metropolis
and
my
thoughts
began
to
turn
in
the
direction
of
manfredonia
once
more
at
a
corner
of
the
street
however
certain
fluent
vociferations
in
english
and
italian
which
nothing
would
induce
me
to
set
down
here
assailed
my
ears
coming
up
apparently
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
earth
i
stopped
to
listen
shocked
to
hear
ribald
language
in
a
holy
town
like
this
then
impelled
by
curiosity
descended
a
long
flight
of
steps
and
found
myself
in
a
subterranean
there
was
drinking
and
going
on
here
among
a
party
of
emigrants
merry
souls
a
good
half
of
them
spoke
english
and
despite
certain
irreverent
phrases
they
quickly
won
my
heart
with
a
here
you
drink
mister
this
dim
recess
was
an
instructive
pendant
to
the
archangel
cavern
a
new
type
of
pilgrim
has
been
evolved
pilgrims
who
think
no
more
of
crossing
to
pittsburg
than
of
a
drive
to
manfredonia
but
their
cave
was
permeated
with
an
odour
of
spilt
wine
and
instead
of
the
subtle
des
abruzzes
fleuris
and
alas
the
object
of
their
worship
was
not
the
chaldean
angel
but
another
and
equally
ancient
eastern
shape
mammon
they
talked
much
of
dollars
and
i
also
heard
several
unorthodox
allusions
to
the
which
was
described
as
played
out
as
well
as
a
remark
to
the
effect
that
only
stay
in
this
country
in
short
these
men
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
human
scale
they
were
the
strong
the
energetic
the
ruthless
perhaps
but
certainly
the
intelligent
and
all
the
while
the
cup
circled
round
with
genial
iteration
and
it
was
universally
agreed
that
whatever
the
other
drawbacks
of
angelo
might
be
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
against
its
native
liquor
it
was
indeed
a
divine
product
a
di
of
noble
pedigree
so
i
thought
as
i
laboriously
scrambled
up
the
stairs
once
more
solaced
by
this
incident
of
the
and
slightly
giddy
from
the
and
here
leaning
against
the
stood
the
coachman
who
had
divined
my
whereabouts
by
some
dark
masonic
intuition
of
sympathy
his
face
expanded
into
an
inept
smile
and
i
quickly
saw
that
instead
of
fortifying
his
constitution
with
sound
food
he
had
tried
alcoholic
methods
of
defence
against
the
inclement
weather
just
a
glass
of
wine
he
explained
but
he
added
the
horse
is
perfectly
sober
that
quadruped
was
equal
to
the
emergency
gloriously
indifferent
to
our
fates
we
glided
down
in
a
vertiginous
but
masterly
from
the
somewhat
objectionable
an
approving
burst
of
sunshine
greeted
our
arrival
on
the
plain
iv
why
has
the
exalted
archangel
chosen
for
an
abode
this
reeking
cell
rather
than
some
temple
in
the
sunshine
as
symbolizing
a
ray
of
light
that
penetrates
into
the
gloom
so
they
will
tell
you
it
is
more
likely
that
he
entered
it
as
an
extirpating
warrior
to
oust
that
heathen
shape
which
strabo
describes
as
dwelling
in
its
dank
recesses
and
to
take
possession
of
the
cleft
in
the
name
of
christianity
sant
angelo
is
one
of
many
places
where
michael
has
performed
the
duty
of
christian
hercules
cleanser
of
augean
stables
for
the
rest
this
is
older
than
any
god
or
devil
it
is
the
cult
of
the
feminine
principle
a
relic
of
that
aboriginal
obsession
of
mankind
to
shelter
in
some
cloven
rock
of
ages
in
the
sacred
womb
of
mother
earth
who
gives
us
food
and
receives
us
after
death
old
and
new
are
but
the
popular
explanations
of
this
dim
primordial
craving
and
hierophants
of
all
ages
have
understood
the
commercial
value
of
the
holy
shudder
which
penetrates
in
these
caverns
to
the
heart
of
worshippers
attuning
them
to
godly
deeds
so
here
close
beside
the
altar
the
priests
are
selling
fragments
of
the
stone
of
saint
michael
the
trade
is
brisk
the
statuette
of
the
archangel
preserved
in
this
subterranean
chapel
is
a
work
of
the
late
renaissance
though
savouring
of
that
mawkish
elaboration
which
then
began
to
taint
local
art
and
literature
and
is
bound
up
with
the
name
of
the
poet
marino
it
is
still
a
passably
virile
figure
but
those
countless
others
in
churches
or
over
do
they
indeed
portray
the
the
martial
prince
of
angels
this
amiable
child
with
girlish
features
can
this
be
the
lucifer
of
christianity
the
sword
of
the
almighty
ut
déus
he
could
hardly
hurt
a
fly
the
hoary
winged
genius
of
chaldea
who
has
absorbed
the
essence
of
so
many
solemn
deities
has
now
in
extreme
old
age
entered
upon
a
second
childhood
and
grown
altogether
too
youthful
for
his
undergoing
a
metimorphosis
beyond
the
boundaries
of
legendary
probability
or
common
sense
every
trace
of
divinity
and
manly
strength
has
been
boiled
out
of
him
so
young
and
earthly
fair
he
looks
rather
like
some
pretty
boy
dressed
up
for
a
game
with
toy
sword
and
helmet
one
wants
to
have
a
romp
with
him
no
warrior
this
beau
mais
ce
pas
la
the
gods
they
say
are
ever
young
and
a
certain
sensuous
and
fleshly
note
is
essential
to
those
of
italy
if
they
are
to
retain
the
love
of
their
worshippers
granted
we
do
not
need
a
scarred
and
hirsute
veteran
but
we
need
at
least
a
personage
capable
of
wielding
the
sword
a
figure
something
like
this
his
starry
helm
unbuckled
show
his
prime
in
manhood
where
youth
ended
by
his
side
as
in
a
zodiac
hung
the
sword
satan
dire
dread
and
in
his
hand
the
spear
there
that
is
an
archangel
of
the
right
kind
and
the
great
dragon
that
old
serpent
called
the
devil
and
satan
has
suffered
a
similar
transformation
he
is
shrunk
into
a
poor
little
reptile
the
merest
worm
hardly
worth
crushing
but
how
should
a
sublime
conception
like
the
apocalyptic
hero
appeal
to
the
common
herd
these
formidable
shapes
emerge
from
the
dusk
offspring
of
momentous
epochs
they
stand
aloof
at
first
but
presently
their
luminous
grandeur
is
dulled
their
haughty
contour
sullied
and
obliterated
by
attrition
they
are
dragged
down
to
the
level
of
their
lowest
adorers
for
the
whole
flock
adapts
its
pace
to
that
of
the
weakest
lamb
no
deity
will
endure
this
treatment
to
be
popularized
and
made
intelligible
to
a
crowd
divinity
comprehended
of
the
masses
ceases
to
be
efficacious
the
egyptians
and
brahmans
understood
that
it
is
not
giving
gods
a
chance
to
interpret
them
in
an
incongruous
and
unsportsmanlike
fashion
but
the
vulgar
have
no
idea
of
propriety
or
fair
play
they
can
not
keep
at
the
proper
distance
they
are
for
ever
taking
liberties
and
in
the
end
the
proudest
god
is
forced
to
yield
we
see
this
same
fatality
in
the
very
word
cherub
how
different
an
image
does
this
plump
and
futile
infant
evoke
to
the
stately
minister
of
the
lord
girt
with
a
sword
of
flame
we
see
it
in
the
italian
madonna
of
whom
whatever
her
mental
acquirements
may
have
been
a
certain
gravity
of
demeanour
is
to
be
presupposed
and
who
none
the
less
grows
more
childishly
smirking
every
day
in
her
son
who
hereabouts
at
least
has
doffed
all
the
serious
attributes
of
manhood
and
dwindled
into
something
not
much
better
than
a
doll
it
was
the
same
in
days
of
old
apollo
whom
saint
michael
has
supplanted
and
eros
and
aphrodite
they
all
go
through
a
process
of
saccharine
deterioration
our
fairest
creatures
once
they
have
passed
their
meridian
vigour
are
liable
to
be
assailed
and
undermined
by
an
insidious
diabetic
tendency
it
is
this
coddling
instinct
of
mankind
which
has
reduced
saint
michael
to
his
present
state
and
an
extraneous
influence
has
worked
in
the
same
direction
the
gradual
softening
of
manners
within
historical
times
that
demasculinization
which
is
an
inevitable
concomitant
of
increasing
social
security
divinity
reflects
its
human
creators
and
their
environment
grandiose
or
warlike
gods
become
superfluous
and
finally
incomprehensible
in
humdrum
days
of
peace
in
order
to
survive
our
deities
like
the
rest
of
us
must
have
a
certain
plasticity
if
recalcitrant
they
are
quietly
relieved
of
their
functions
and
forgotten
this
is
what
has
happened
in
italy
to
god
the
father
and
the
holy
ghost
who
have
vanished
from
the
vulgar
olympus
whereas
the
devil
thanks
to
that
unprincipled
versatility
for
which
he
is
famous
remains
ever
young
and
popular
the
of
the
are
also
to
blame
indeed
so
far
as
the
angelic
shapes
of
south
italy
are
concerned
the
influence
of
the
renaissance
has
been
wholly
malefic
aliens
to
the
soil
they
were
at
first
quite
unknown
not
one
is
pictured
in
the
neapolitan
catacombs
next
came
the
brief
period
of
their
artistic
glory
then
the
syncretism
of
the
renaissance
when
these
winged
messengers
were
amalgamated
with
pagan
and
began
to
flutter
in
foolish
baroque
fashion
about
the
queen
of
heaven
after
the
pattern
of
the
disreputable
little
genii
attendant
upon
a
venus
of
a
bad
school
that
same
instinct
which
degraded
a
youthful
eros
into
the
childish
cupid
was
the
to
the
pristine
dignity
and
holiness
of
angels
nowadays
we
see
the
perversity
of
it
all
we
have
come
to
our
senses
and
can
appraise
the
revival
at
its
true
worth
and
our
modern
sculptors
will
rear
you
a
respectable
angel
a
grave
adolescent
according
to
the
best
canons
of
taste
should
you
still
possess
the
faith
that
once
requisitioned
such
works
of
art
we
travellers
acquaint
ourselves
with
the
lineage
of
this
celestial
messenger
but
it
can
hardly
be
supposed
that
the
worshippers
now
swarming
at
his
shrine
know
much
of
these
things
how
shall
one
discover
their
real
feelings
in
regard
to
this
great
and
his
life
and
deeds
well
some
idea
of
this
may
be
gathered
from
the
literature
sold
on
the
spot
i
purchased
three
of
these
modern
tracts
printed
respectively
at
bitonto
molfetta
and
naples
the
popular
song
in
honour
of
michael
contains
this
verse
nell
ora
della
morte
ci
salvi
dal
inferno
e
a
regno
sempiterno
ci
guidi
per
pietà
guidi
per
pietà
this
is
the
next
the
history
and
miracles
of
michael
opens
with
a
rollicking
dialogue
in
verse
between
the
archangel
and
the
devil
concerning
a
soul
it
ends
with
a
goodly
list
in
verses
of
the
miracles
performed
by
the
angel
such
as
helping
women
in
childbirth
curing
the
blind
and
other
wonders
that
differ
nothing
from
those
wrought
by
humbler
earthly
saints
lastly
the
novena
in
onore
di
michele
arcangelo
printed
in
third
edition
with
ecclesiastical
approval
has
the
following
noteworthy
paragraph
on
the
devotion
for
the
sacred
stones
of
the
grotto
of
michael
it
is
very
salutary
to
hold
in
esteem
the
stones
which
are
taken
from
the
sacred
cavern
partly
because
from
immemorial
times
they
have
always
been
held
in
veneration
by
the
faithful
and
also
because
they
have
been
placed
as
relics
of
sepulchres
and
altars
furthermore
it
is
known
that
during
the
plague
which
afflicted
the
kingdom
of
naples
in
the
year
monsignor
puccini
archbishop
of
manfredonia
recommended
every
one
to
carry
devoutly
on
his
person
a
fragment
of
the
sacred
stone
whereby
the
majority
were
saved
from
the
pestilence
and
this
augmented
the
devotion
bestowed
on
them
the
cholera
is
on
the
increase
and
this
may
account
for
the
rapid
sale
of
the
stones
at
this
moment
this
pamphlet
also
contains
a
litany
in
which
the
titles
of
the
archangel
are
enumerated
he
is
among
other
things
secretary
of
god
liberator
from
infernal
chains
defender
in
the
hour
of
death
custodian
of
the
pope
spirit
of
light
wisest
of
magistrates
terror
of
demons
of
the
armies
of
the
lord
lash
of
heresies
adorer
of
the
word
incarnate
guide
of
pilgrims
conductor
of
mortals
mars
mercury
hercules
apollo
mithra
what
nobler
ancestry
can
angel
desire
and
yet
as
if
these
complicated
and
responsible
functions
did
not
suffice
for
his
energies
he
has
twenty
others
among
them
being
that
of
custodian
of
the
holy
family
who
apparently
need
a
protector
a
monsieur
paoli
like
any
mortal
royalties
blasphemous
rubbish
i
can
hear
some
methodist
exclaiming
and
one
may
well
be
tempted
to
sneer
at
those
pilgrims
for
the
more
enlightened
of
whom
such
literature
is
printed
for
they
are
unquestionably
a
repulsive
crowd
old
women
for
the
witch
of
endor
dishevelled
anaemic
and
girls
boys
too
weak
to
handle
a
spade
at
home
pathetically
uncouth
with
mouths
agape
and
eyes
expressing
every
grade
of
uncontrolled
emotion
from
wildest
joy
to
downright
idiotcy
how
one
realizes
down
in
this
cavern
the
effect
upon
some
cultured
ancient
like
rutilius
namatianus
of
the
among
those
early
christian
converts
those
who
shun
the
light
drawn
as
they
were
from
the
same
social
classes
towards
the
same
dark
underground
rites
one
can
neither
love
nor
respect
such
people
and
to
affect
pity
for
them
would
be
more
consonant
with
their
religion
than
with
my
own
but
it
is
perfectly
easy
to
understand
them
for
thirteen
centuries
this
has
been
going
on
thirteen
centuries
no
this
site
was
an
oracle
in
heathen
days
and
we
know
that
such
were
frequented
by
men
not
a
whit
less
barbarous
and
bigoted
than
their
modern
representatives
nothing
is
a
greater
mistake
than
to
suppose
that
the
crowds
of
old
rome
and
athens
were
more
refined
than
our
own
demosthenes
sir
was
talking
to
an
assembly
of
brutes
for
thirty
centuries
then
let
us
say
a
deity
has
attracted
the
faithful
to
his
shrine
sant
angelo
has
become
a
vacuum
as
it
were
which
must
be
periodically
filled
up
from
the
surrounding
country
these
pilgrimages
are
in
the
blood
of
the
people
infants
they
are
carried
there
adults
they
carry
their
own
offspring
their
tottering
steps
are
still
supported
by
kindly
and
sturdier
popes
and
emperors
no
longer
scramble
up
these
slopes
the
spirit
of
piety
has
abated
among
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
so
much
is
certain
but
the
rays
of
light
that
strike
the
topmost
branches
have
not
yet
penetrated
to
the
rank
and
seething
undergrowth
and
then
what
else
can
one
offer
to
these
abruzzi
their
life
is
one
of
miserable
revolting
destitution
they
have
no
games
or
sports
no
local
racing
clubs
politics
or
any
of
those
other
joys
that
diversify
the
lives
of
our
peasantry
no
touch
of
humanity
reaches
them
no
kindly
dames
send
them
jellies
or
blankets
no
cheery
doctor
enquires
for
their
children
they
read
no
newspapers
or
books
and
lack
even
the
mild
excitements
of
church
chapel
or
the
vicar
daughter
or
the
latest
row
with
his
lady
nothing
their
existence
is
almost
bestial
in
its
blankness
i
know
them
i
have
lived
among
them
for
four
months
in
the
year
they
are
cooped
up
in
damp
dens
not
to
be
called
chambers
where
an
englishman
would
deem
it
infamous
to
keep
a
dog
cooped
up
amid
squalor
that
must
be
seen
to
be
believed
for
the
rest
of
the
time
they
struggle
in
the
sweat
of
their
brow
to
wrest
a
few
blades
of
corn
from
the
ungrateful
limestone
their
visits
to
the
archangel
these
vernal
and
autumnal
picnics
are
their
sole
form
of
amusement
the
movement
is
said
to
have
diminished
since
the
early
nineties
when
thirty
thousand
of
them
used
to
come
here
annually
it
may
well
be
the
case
but
i
imagine
that
this
is
due
not
so
much
to
increasing
enlightenment
as
to
the
depopulation
caused
by
america
many
villages
have
recently
been
reduced
to
half
their
former
number
of
inhabitants
and
here
they
kneel
candle
in
hand
on
the
wet
flags
of
this
foetid
and
malodorous
cave
gazing
in
rapture
upon
the
blandly
beaming
idol
their
sensibilities
tickled
by
resplendent
priests
reciting
latin
phrases
while
the
organ
overhead
plays
wheezy
extracts
from
la
forza
del
destino
or
the
waltz
out
of
boito
mefistofele
for
sure
it
must
be
a
foretaste
of
heaven
and
likely
enough
these
are
the
poor
in
heart
for
whom
that
kingdom
is
reserved
one
may
call
this
a
debased
form
of
christianity
whether
it
would
have
been
distasteful
to
the
feelings
of
the
founder
of
that
cult
is
another
question
and
debased
or
not
it
is
at
least
alive
and
palpitating
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
certain
other
varieties
but
the
archangel
as
was
inevitable
has
suffered
a
sad
change
his
fairest
attribute
of
of
apollo
is
no
longer
his
own
it
has
been
claimed
and
appropriated
by
the
light
of
the
world
his
new
master
one
by
one
his
functions
have
been
stripped
from
him
all
save
in
name
as
happens
to
men
and
angels
alike
when
they
take
service
under
jealous
lords
what
is
now
left
of
saint
michael
the
glittering
hierarch
can
he
still
endure
the
light
of
sun
or
has
he
not
shrivelled
into
a
spectral
hermes
a
grisly
psychopomp
bowing
his
head
in
minished
glory
and
leading
men
souls
no
longer
aloft
but
downwards
down
to
the
pale
regions
of
things
that
have
been
and
will
it
be
long
ere
he
too
is
thrust
by
some
flaming
demogorgon
into
these
same
realms
of
minos
into
that
shadowy
underworld
where
dwell
saturn
and
kronos
and
other
cracked
and
shivered
ideals
so
i
mused
that
afternoon
driving
down
the
slopes
from
sant
angelo
comfortably
sheltered
against
the
storm
while
the
generous
mountain
wine
sped
through
my
veins
warming
my
fancy
then
at
last
the
sun
came
out
in
a
sudden
burst
of
light
opening
a
rift
in
the
vapours
and
revealing
the
whole
chain
of
the
apennines
together
with
the
peaked
crater
of
mount
vulture
the
spectacle
cheered
me
and
led
me
to
think
that
such
a
day
might
worthily
be
rounded
off
by
a
visit
to
sipontum
which
lies
a
few
miles
beyond
manfredonia
on
the
foggia
road
but
i
approached
the
subject
cautiously
fearing
that
the
coachman
might
demur
at
this
extra
work
far
from
it
i
had
gained
his
affection
and
he
would
conduct
me
whithersoever
i
liked
only
to
sipontum
not
to
foggia
to
naples
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
as
for
the
horse
he
was
none
the
worse
for
the
trip
not
a
bit
the
worse
he
liked
nothing
better
than
running
in
front
of
a
carriage
besides
suo
dovere
it
was
his
duty
sipontum
is
so
ancient
that
it
was
founded
they
say
by
that
legendary
diomed
who
acted
in
the
same
capacity
for
arpi
and
other
cities
but
this
record
does
not
satisfy
monsignor
sarnelli
its
historian
according
to
whom
it
was
already
a
flourishing
town
when
shem
first
son
of
noah
became
its
king
he
reigned
about
the
year
of
the
creation
of
the
world
two
years
after
the
deluge
he
was
years
old
and
at
that
age
begat
a
son
arfaxad
after
whose
birth
he
lived
yet
another
five
hundred
years
the
second
king
of
sipontum
was
appulus
who
ruled
in
the
year
later
on
saint
peter
sojourned
here
and
baptized
a
few
people
of
sipontum
nothing
is
left
nothing
save
a
church
and
even
that
built
only
yesterday
in
the
eleventh
century
a
church
in
the
pisan
style
with
wrought
marble
columns
reposing
on
lions
sculptured
diamond
ornaments
and
other
crafty
stonework
that
gladdens
the
eye
it
used
to
be
the
seat
of
an
archbishopric
and
its
fine
episcopal
chairs
are
now
preserved
at
sant
angelo
and
you
may
still
do
homage
to
the
authentic
byzantine
madonna
painted
on
wood
by
saint
luke
with
staring
eyes
and
holding
the
infant
on
her
left
arm
earthquakes
and
saracen
incursions
ruined
the
town
which
became
wholly
abandoned
when
was
built
with
its
stones
of
pagan
antiquity
there
are
a
few
capitals
lying
about
as
well
as
granite
columns
in
the
curious
old
crypt
a
pillar
stands
all
forlorn
in
a
field
and
quite
close
to
the
church
are
erected
two
others
the
larger
of
cipollino
beautified
by
a
patina
of
golden
lichen
a
marble
worn
half
through
with
usage
of
ropes
may
be
found
buried
in
the
rank
grass
the
plain
whereon
stood
the
great
city
of
sipus
is
covered
now
with
bristly
herbage
the
sea
has
retired
from
its
old
beach
and
cattle
browse
on
the
site
of
those
lordly
quays
and
palaces
not
a
stone
is
left
malaria
and
desolation
reign
supreme
it
is
a
profoundly
melancholy
spot
yet
i
was
glad
of
the
brief
vision
i
shall
have
fond
and
enduring
memories
of
that
sanctuary
the
travertine
of
its
artfully
carven
fabric
glowing
in
the
sunset
of
the
forsaken
plain
beyond
full
of
ghostly
phantoms
of
the
past
as
for
manfredonia
it
is
a
sad
little
place
when
the
south
wind
moans
and
mountains
are
veiled
in
mists
v
land
of
horace
venosa
nowadays
lies
off
the
beaten
track
there
are
only
three
trains
a
day
from
the
little
junction
of
rocchetta
and
they
take
over
an
hour
to
traverse
the
thirty
odd
kilometres
of
sparsely
inhabited
land
it
is
an
uphill
journey
for
venosa
lies
at
a
good
elevation
they
say
that
german
professors
bent
on
horatian
studies
occasionally
descend
from
those
old
railway
carriages
but
the
ordinary
travellers
are
either
or
commercial
gentlemen
from
north
italy
worse
than
malaria
or
brigandage
against
both
of
which
a
man
may
protect
himself
there
is
no
escaping
from
the
companionship
of
these
these
pathologically
inquisitive
and
altogether
dreadful
people
they
are
the
terror
of
the
south
and
it
stands
to
reason
that
only
the
most
incapable
and
most
disagreeable
of
their
kind
are
sent
to
places
like
venosa
one
asks
oneself
whether
this
town
has
greatly
changed
since
roman
times
to
be
sure
it
has
domestic
calamities
and
earthquakes
such
as
the
terrible
one
of
have
altered
it
beyond
recognition
the
amphitheatre
that
seated
ten
thousand
spectators
is
merged
into
the
earth
and
of
all
the
buildings
of
roman
date
nothing
is
left
save
a
pile
of
masonry
designated
as
the
tomb
of
the
marcellus
who
was
killed
here
by
hannibal
soldiery
and
a
few
reticulated
walls
of
the
second
century
or
thereabouts
known
as
the
house
of
horace
as
genuine
as
that
of
juliet
in
verona
or
the
mansion
of
loreto
yet
the
tradition
is
an
old
one
and
the
builder
of
the
house
whoever
he
was
certainly
displayed
some
poetic
taste
in
his
selection
of
a
fine
view
across
the
valley
there
is
an
indifferent
statue
of
horace
in
the
marketplace
a
previous
one
also
described
as
horace
was
found
to
be
the
effigy
of
somebody
else
thus
much
i
learn
from
lupoli
iter
venusinum
but
there
are
ancient
inscriptions
galore
worked
into
the
masonry
of
buildings
or
lying
about
at
random
mommsen
has
collected
numbers
of
them
in
his
and
since
that
time
some
sixty
new
ones
have
been
discovered
and
then
the
stone
lions
of
roman
days
couched
forlornly
at
street
corners
in
courtyards
and
at
fountains
in
every
stage
of
decrepitude
with
broken
jaws
and
noses
missing
legs
and
tails
venosa
is
a
veritable
infirmary
for
mutilated
antiques
of
this
species
now
the
lion
is
doubtless
a
nobly
decorative
beast
but
perdrix
why
not
a
few
griffons
or
other
ornaments
the
romans
were
not
an
imaginative
race
the
country
around
must
have
looked
different
in
olden
days
horace
describes
it
as
covered
with
forests
and
from
a
manuscript
of
the
early
seventeenth
century
which
has
lately
been
printed
one
learns
that
the
surrounding
regions
were
full
of
hares
rabbits
foxes
roe
deer
wild
boars
martens
porcupines
hedgehogs
tortoises
and
wolves
creatures
which
have
now
for
the
most
part
deserted
venosa
still
there
are
left
some
stretches
of
oak
at
the
back
of
the
town
and
the
main
lines
of
the
land
can
not
change
yonder
lies
the
horatian
forense
and
acherontia
nest
further
on
the
glades
of
bantia
the
modern
banzi
the
garganian
mount
on
which
the
poet
eye
must
often
have
rested
emerges
above
the
plain
of
apulia
like
an
island
and
such
it
is
an
island
of
austrian
stone
stranded
upon
the
beach
of
italy
monte
vulture
still
dominates
the
landscape
although
at
this
nearness
the
crater
loses
its
shapely
conical
outline
and
assumes
a
serrated
edge
on
its
summit
i
perceive
a
gigantic
cross
one
of
a
number
of
such
symbols
which
were
erected
by
the
clericals
at
the
time
of
the
recent
rationalist
congress
in
rome
from
this
chronicler
i
learn
another
interesting
fact
that
venosa
was
not
malarious
in
the
author
day
he
calls
it
healthy
and
says
that
the
only
complaint
from
which
the
inhabitants
suffered
was
ponture
pleurisy
it
is
now
within
the
infected
zone
i
dare
say
the
deforestation
of
the
country
which
prevented
the
downflow
of
the
rivers
choking
up
their
beds
with
detritus
and
producing
stagnant
pools
favourable
to
the
breeding
of
the
mosquito
has
helped
to
spread
the
plague
in
many
parts
of
italy
in
horace
days
venosa
was
immune
although
rome
and
certain
rural
districts
were
already
malarious
ancient
votive
tablets
to
the
mephitis
malaria
have
been
found
not
far
from
here
in
the
plain
below
the
present
city
of
potenza
a
good
deal
of
old
roman
blood
and
spirit
seems
to
survive
here
after
the
noise
of
the
neapolitan
provinces
where
chattering
takes
the
place
of
thinking
it
is
a
relief
to
find
oneself
in
the
company
of
these
grave
folks
who
really
converse
like
the
scotch
in
disinterested
and
impersonal
fashion
their
attitude
towards
religious
matters
strikes
me
as
peculiarly
horatian
it
is
not
active
scepticism
but
rather
a
bland
tolerance
or
what
one
of
them
described
as
indifferentismo
submission
to
acts
of
worship
and
all
other
usages
whatever
they
may
be
consecrated
by
time
the
conservative
roman
spirit
and
if
you
walk
towards
sunset
along
any
of
the
roads
leading
into
the
country
you
will
meet
the
peasants
riding
home
from
their
field
labours
accompanied
by
their
dogs
pigs
and
goats
and
among
them
you
will
recognize
many
types
of
roman
physiognomies
faces
of
orators
and
statesmen
familiar
from
old
coins
about
a
third
of
the
population
are
of
the
complexion
with
blue
or
green
eyes
but
the
women
are
not
handsome
although
the
town
derives
its
name
from
benoth
venus
some
genuine
roman
families
have
continued
to
exist
to
this
day
such
as
that
of
cenna
cinna
one
of
them
was
the
author
of
the
chronicle
above
referred
to
and
there
is
an
antique
worked
into
the
walls
of
the
trinità
abbey
depicting
some
earlier
members
of
this
local
family
one
is
astonished
how
large
a
literature
has
grown
up
around
this
small
place
but
indeed
the
number
of
monographs
dealing
with
every
one
of
these
little
italian
towns
is
a
ceaseless
source
of
surprise
look
below
the
surface
and
you
will
find
in
all
of
them
an
undercurrent
of
keen
spirituality
a
nucleus
of
half
a
dozen
widely
read
and
thoughtful
men
who
foster
the
best
traditions
of
the
mind
you
will
not
find
them
in
the
town
council
or
at
the
café
no
newspapers
commend
their
labours
no
millionaires
or
learned
societies
come
to
their
assistance
and
though
typography
is
cheap
in
this
country
they
often
stint
themselves
of
the
necessities
of
life
in
order
to
produce
these
treatises
of
calm
research
there
is
a
deep
gulf
here
between
the
mundane
and
the
intellectual
life
these
men
are
retiring
in
their
habits
and
one
can
not
but
revere
their
scholarly
and
almost
ascetic
spirit
that
survives
like
a
green
oasis
amid
the
desert
of
politics
roguery
and
municipal
corruption
the
city
fathers
of
venosa
are
reputed
rich
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
yet
their
town
is
by
no
means
a
clean
place
it
is
twice
as
dirty
as
lucera
a
reposeful
dirtiness
not
vulgar
or
chaotic
but
testifying
to
neglect
to
a
feudal
contempt
of
cleanliness
you
crawl
through
narrow
streets
looking
down
into
subterranean
family
bedrooms
that
must
be
insufferably
damp
in
winter
and
filled
during
the
hot
months
with
an
odour
hard
to
conceive
there
is
electric
lighting
of
course
a
paternal
government
having
made
the
price
of
petroleum
so
prohibitive
that
the
use
of
electricity
for
became
quite
common
in
the
lowliest
places
but
the
crude
glare
only
serves
to
show
up
the
general
squalor
one
reason
for
this
state
of
affairs
is
that
there
are
no
quarries
for
decent
in
the
neighbourhood
and
another
that
venosa
possesses
no
large
citizen
class
properly
so
called
the
inhabitants
are
mostly
peasant
proprietors
and
field
labourers
who
leave
the
town
in
the
morning
and
return
home
at
night
with
their
beasts
having
learned
by
bitter
experience
to
take
up
their
domiciles
in
the
towns
rather
than
in
the
which
was
infested
with
brigandage
and
in
an
unsettled
state
up
to
a
short
time
ago
the
cincinnatus
note
dominates
here
and
with
an
agricultural
population
no
city
can
be
kept
clean
but
venosa
has
one
inestimable
advantage
over
lucera
and
most
italian
towns
there
is
no
octroi
would
it
be
believed
that
naples
is
surrounded
by
a
towering
chinese
wall
miles
upon
miles
of
it
crowned
with
a
complicated
apparatus
of
and
patrolled
night
and
day
by
a
horde
of
armed
to
the
teeth
lest
some
peasant
should
throw
a
bundle
of
onions
into
the
sacred
precincts
of
the
town
without
paying
the
duty
of
half
a
farthing
no
nation
with
any
sense
of
humour
would
endure
this
sort
of
thing
every
one
resents
the
airs
of
this
army
of
official
loafers
who
infest
the
land
and
would
be
far
better
employed
themselves
in
planting
onions
upon
the
many
miles
of
italy
which
now
lie
fallow
the
results
of
the
system
have
been
shown
to
be
inadequate
but
as
my
friend
the
roman
deputy
once
asked
me
if
we
dismiss
these
fellows
from
their
job
how
are
we
to
employ
them
nothing
is
simpler
i
replied
enrol
them
into
the
town
council
of
naples
it
already
contains
more
than
all
the
government
offices
of
london
put
together
a
few
more
will
surely
make
no
difference
by
bacchus
he
cried
you
foreigners
have
ideas
we
could
dispose
of
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
of
them
at
least
in
the
way
you
suggest
make
a
note
of
that
for
our
next
session
and
so
he
did
but
the
of
naples
though
extensive
is
a
purely
local
charity
and
i
question
whether
its
inmates
will
hear
of
any
one
save
their
own
cousins
and
figuring
as
colleagues
in
office
every
attempt
at
innovation
in
agriculture
as
in
industry
is
forthwith
discouraged
by
new
and
subtle
impositions
which
lie
in
wait
for
the
enterprising
italian
and
punish
him
for
his
ideas
there
is
of
course
a
prohibitive
duty
on
every
article
or
implement
manufactured
abroad
there
is
the
octroi
a
relic
of
medisevalism
the
most
unscientific
futile
and
vexatious
of
taxes
there
are
municipal
dues
to
be
paid
on
animals
bought
and
animals
sold
on
animals
kept
and
animals
killed
on
milk
and
and
bricks
on
timber
for
scaffolding
and
lead
and
tiles
and
wine
on
every
conceivable
object
which
the
peasant
produces
or
requires
for
his
existence
and
one
should
see
the
faces
of
the
municipal
who
extort
these
tributes
god
alone
knows
from
what
classes
of
the
populace
they
are
recruited
certain
it
is
that
their
physiognomy
reflects
their
miserable
calling
one
can
endure
the
militarism
of
germany
and
the
bureaucracy
of
austria
but
it
is
revolting
to
see
decent
italian
countryfolk
at
the
mercy
of
these
uncouth
savages
veritable
whose
only
intelligible
expression
is
one
of
malice
striving
to
break
through
a
crust
of
congenital
cretinism
we
hear
much
of
the
great
artists
and
speculative
philosophers
of
old
italy
the
artists
of
modern
italy
are
her
bureaucrats
who
design
and
elaborate
the
taxes
her
philosophers
the
peasants
who
pay
them
in
point
of
method
at
least
there
is
nothing
to
choose
between
the
exactions
of
the
municipal
and
governmental
ruffians
i
once
saw
an
old
woman
fined
fifty
francs
for
having
in
her
possession
a
pound
of
by
what
logic
will
you
make
it
clear
to
ignorant
people
that
it
is
wrong
to
take
salt
out
of
the
sea
whence
every
one
takes
fish
which
are
more
valuable
the
waste
of
time
employed
over
red
tape
alone
on
these
occasions
would
lead
to
a
revolution
anywhere
save
among
men
inured
by
long
abuses
to
this
particular
form
of
tyranny
no
wonder
the
women
of
the
rather
than
waste
three
precious
hours
in
arguments
about
a
few
cheeses
will
smuggle
them
past
the
authorities
under
the
device
of
being
no
wonder
their
wisest
old
men
regard
the
paternal
government
as
a
successfully
organized
swindle
which
it
is
the
citizen
bounden
duty
to
frustrate
whenever
possible
have
ever
tried
to
convey
in
legal
fashion
a
bottle
of
wine
from
one
town
into
another
or
to
import
by
means
of
a
an
old
into
some
village
by
the
sea
is
a
fine
art
only
to
be
learnt
by
years
of
apprenticeship
the
regulations
on
these
subjects
though
ineffably
childish
look
simple
enough
on
paper
they
take
no
account
of
that
personal
element
which
is
everything
in
the
south
of
the
ruffled
tempers
of
those
gorgeous

inert
creatures
who
disturbed
in
their
siestas

may
keep
you
waiting
half
a
day

they
fumble
ominously
over
some
scrap

they
are

to
provoking
fits

this
is
all

all

no

even
englishmen
discover
that
in

becomes
a
necessity
a
rule
of
life

soon
enough
much
more
than
a
mere
necessity
for
even
as
the

new
to

offer
him
a

instantly
brought
to
by
its
odour
but
after
a
few
mouthfuls
declares
it
to
be
the
very
apple
of
paradise
and
marvels
how
he
could
have
survived
so
long
in
the
benighted
lands
where
such
ambrosial
fare
is
not
even
as
the
true
connaisseur
who
beholding
some
rare
scarlet
idol
from
the
forests
at
first
casts
it
aside
and
then
light
dawning
as
he
ponders
over
those
monstrous
complexities
begins
to
realize
that
they
and
they
alone
contain
the
quintessential
formulae
of
all
the
fervent
dreamings
of
scopas
and
michelangelo
even
as
he
who
first
upon
a
peak
in
darien
gazed
awestruck
upon
the
grand
pacific
slumbering
at
his
feet
till
presently
his
senses
reeled
at
the
blissful
prospect
of
fresh
regions
unrolling
themselves
boundless
past
the
fulfilment
of
his
fondest
hopes
even
so
in
italy
the
domesticated
englishman
is
amazed
to
find
that
he
possesses
a
sense
hitherto
unrevealed
opening
up
a
new
horizon
a
new
zest
in
life
the
sense
of
at
first
being
an
honest
man
he
is
shocked
at
the
thought
of
such
a
thing
next
like
a
sensible
person
reconciled
to
the
inevitable
lastly
as
befits
his
virile
race
he
learns
to
play
the
game
so
well
that
the
horrified
officials
grudgingly
admit
and
it
is
their
highest
praise

antiquities

days

upon

there
is
not

of

are
discovered
in
another
part
of
the

which
cause
the
professor
to
revise
all
his
previous

the
work
must
be
written
anew
and
brought
up
to

hardly
is
this
accomplished
when
fresh
catacombs
are
found
elsewhere
necessitating
a
further

will
find
accounts
of

us
what
sounds
rather
surprising
namely
that
the
abbey
was
built
after
a
lombard
model
and
not
a
french
one
be
that
as
it
may
and
they
certainly
show
good
grounds
for
their
contention
the
ruin
is
a
place
of
rare
charm
not
easily
can
one
see
relics
of
roman
hebrew
and
norman
life
crushed
into
so
small
a
space
welded
together
by
the
massive
yet
fair
architecture
of
the
benedictines
and
interpenetrated
at
the
same
time
with
a
mephistophelian
spirit
of
modern
indifference
of
cynical
for
although
this
is
a
national
monument
nothing
whatever
is
done
in
the
way
of
repairs
never
a
month
passes
without
some
richly
carven

the
process

were
it
not
for

the

would
long

have
become
an
impassable
chaos

the

can
not
be
without
enormous
outlay
nobody
dreams
of
such
a

a
yearly
expenditure
of
ten

however
would
go
far
towards
arresting
its
fall

where
shall
the
money
be
found
this

enamoured
of
all
that

spend
sixty

the
difference
between
benedictine
dignity
and
the
buffoonery

subsequently
tainted
the
catholicism
of
the
youth
on
its
gable
sits
a
strange
emblem
a
large
stone
dog
gazing
amiably
at
the
landscape
the
saint
during
his
earthly
career
was
always
accompanied
by
a
dog
and
now
likes
to
have
him
on
the
roof
of
his
sanctuary
the
norman
church
attached
to
the
trinità
lies
at
a
lower
level
than
that
building
having
been
constructed
says
lupoli
on
the
foundations
of
a
temple
to
hymenaeus
it
may
be
so
but
one
distrusts
lupoli
a
remarkable
norman
capital
now
wrought
into
a
font
is
preserved
here
and
i
was
interested
in
watching
the
behaviour
of
a
procession
of
female
pilgrims
in
regard
to
it
trembling
with
emotion
they
perambulated
the
sacred
stone
kissing
every
one
of
its
corners
then
they
dipped
their
hands
into
its
basin
and
kissed
them
devoutly
an
old
hag
the
mistress
of
the
ceremonies
muttered
tutti
santi
tutti
santi
at
each
osculation
next
they
prostrated
themselves
on
the
floor
and
licked
the
cold
stones
and
after
wallowing
there
awhile
rose
up
and
began
to
kiss
a
small
fissure
in
the
masonry
of
the
wall
the
old
woman
whispering
santissimo
a
familiar
spectacle
no
doubt
but
one
which
never
fails
of
its
effect
this
crack
in
the
wall
with
its
suggestions
of
attracted
me
so
strongly
that
i
begged
a
priest
to
explain
to
me
its
mystical
signification
but
he
only
said
with
a
touch
of
mediaeval
contempt
femine
he
showed
me
later
on
a
round
roman
pillar
near
the
entrance
of
the
church
worn
smooth
by
the
bodies
of
females
who
press
themselves
between
it
and
the
wall
in
order
to
become
mothers
the
notion
caused
him
some
amusement
he
evidently
thought
this
practice
a
speciality
of
venosa
in
my
country
i
said
pillars
with
a
contrary
effect
would
be
more
popular
among
the
fair
sex
lear
gives
another
account
of
this
phallic
emblem
he
says
that
perambulating
it
hand
in
hand
with
another
person
the
two
are
sure
to
remain
friends
for
life

is

thriftily
cultivated

was
here
yesterday
that
i
came
upon
an
unexpected
sight
an
army
of
workmen
engaged
in
burrowing
furiously
into
the
bowels
of

earth
they
told
me
that
this
tunnel
would
presently
become
one
of
the
arteries
of
that
vast
system
the
apulian
aqueduct
the
discovery
accorded
with
my

mood
for
the
conception
and
execution
alike
of
this
grandiose
project
are
worthy
of
the

at

the
italian

is
erecting

its
glory

monument
more
durable

this
is
their
heritage
from
the
romans
this
talent
for
dealing
with
rocks
and
waters
for
bridling
a
destructive
environment
and
making
it
subservient
to
purposes
of
human
intercourse
it
is
a
part
of
that
practical
roman
genius

appealed

chapter
the
ocean
and
snowy
alps
were
beyond
the
range
of
his
affections
his
love
of
nature
was
heartfelt

his
nature
was
not

it

beholds
nothing

confusion

the
spot
i
observe
one
is

to
return
to
the

to
see
the
beauty
of

only

subsidiary

as
the
twelfth
century
as
the
fons
bandusinus
and
ughelli
in
his
italia
sacra
cites
a
deed
of
the
year
speaking
of
a
church
at
the
bandusian
fount
near
venosa
church
and
fountain
have
now
disappeared
but
the
site
of
the
former
they
say
is
known
and
close
to
it
there
once
issued
a
copious
spring
called
fontana
grande
this
is
probably
the
horatian
one
and
is
also
i
doubt
not
that
referred
to
in
cenna
chronicle
of
venosa
at
torre
san
gervasio
are
the
ruins
of
a
castle
and
an
abundant
spring
of
water
colder
than
all
the
waters
of
venosa
amabile
i
could
discover
no
one
in
the
place
to
show
me
where
this
now
vanished
church
stood
i
rather
think
it
occupied
the
site
of
the
present
church
of
saint
anthony
the
oldest
in
san
gervasio
as
to
the
fountain
there
are
now
two
of
them
at
some
considerable
distance
from
each
other
both
of
them
are
copious
and
both
lie
near
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
which
the
village
now
stands
capmartin
de
chaupy
has
reasons
for
believing
that
in
former
times
san
gervasio
did
not
occupy
its
present
exalted
position
vol
iii
one
of
them
gushes
out
on
the
plain
near
the
railway
station
and
has
been
rebuilt
within
recent
times
it
goes
by
the
name
of
fontana
rotta
the
other
the
fontana
del
fico
lies
on
the
high
road
to
spinazzola
the
water
spouts
out
of
seven
mouths
and
near
at
hand
is
a
plantation
of
young
sycamores
the
basin
of
this
fount
was
also
rebuilt
about
ten
years
ago
at
no
little
expense
and
has
now
a
thoroughly
modern
and
businesslike
aspect
but
i
was
told
that
a
complicated
network
of
subterranean
pipes
and
passages
leading
to
god
knows
where
was
unearthed
during
the
process
of
reconstruction
it
was
magnificent
masonry
said
my
informant
who
was
an
of
the
excavations
but
could
tell
me
nothing
more
of
interest
the
problem
how
far
either
of
these
fountains
fulfils
the
conditions
postulated
in
the
last
verse
of
horace
ode
may
be
solved
by
every
one
according
as
he
pleases
in
fact
there
is
no
other
way
of
solving
it
in
my
professorial
mood
i
should
cite
the
cavern
and
the
downward
leaping
waters
against
the
hypothesis
that
the
bandusian
fount
stood
on
either
of
these
modern
sites
in
favour
of
it
one
might
argue
that
the
conventional
rhetoric
of
all
roman
art
may
have
added
these
embellishing
touches
and
cite
in
confirmation
thereof
the
last
two
lines
of
the
previous
verse
mentioning
animals
that
could
hardly
have
slaked
their
thirst
with
any
convenience
at
a
cavernous
spring
such
as
he
describes
caverns
moreover
are
not
always
near
the
summits
of
hills
they
may
be
at
the
foot
of
them
and
water
even
the
thames
at
london
bridge
always
leaps
downhill
more
or
less
of
more
importance
is
old
discovery
of
the
northerly
aspect
of
one
of
these
springs
thee
the
fierce
season
of
the
blazing
can
not
touch
there
may
have
been
a
cave
at
the
back
of
the
fontana
del
fico
the
fontana
rotta
is
hopelessly
uncavernous
for
the
rest
there
is
no
reason
why
the
fountain
should
not
have
changed
its
position
since
ancient
days
on
the
contrary
several
things
might
incline
one
to
think
that
it
has
been
forced
to
abandon
the
high
grounds
and
seek
its
present
lower
level
to
begin
with
the
hill
on
which
the
village
stands
is
honeycombed
by
hives
of
caves
which
the
inhabitants
have
carved
out
of
the
loose
conglomerate
which
by
the
way
hardly
corresponds
with
the
poet
and
it
may
well
be
that
a
considerable
collapse
of
these
obstructed
the
original
source
of
the
waters
and
obliged
them
to
seek
a
vent
lower
down
next
there
are
the
notorious
effects
of
deforestation
an
old
man
told
me
that
in
his
early
days
the
hill
was
covered
with
timber
indeed
this
whole
land
now
a
stretch
of
rolling
grassy
downs
was
decently
wooded
up
to
a
short
time
ago
i
observed
that
the
roof
of
the
oldest
of
the
three
churches
that
of
saint
anthony
is
formed
of
wooden
rafters
a
rare
material
hereabouts
deforestation
would
also
cause
the
waters
to
issue
at
a
lower
level
lastly
and
chiefly
the
possible
shatterings
of
earthquakes
catastrophes
such
as
those
which
have
damaged
venosa
in
days
past
may
have
played
havoc
with
the
of
this
place
by
choking
up
their
old
channels
my
acquaintance
with
the
habits
of
apulian
earthquakes
with
the
science
of
hydrodynamics
and
the
geological
formation
of
san
gervasio
is
not
sufficiently
extensive
to
allow
me
to
express
a
mature
opinion
i
will
content
myself
with
presenting
to
future
investigators
the
plausible
theory
plausible
because
conveniently
difficult
to
refute
that
some
terrestrial
upheaval
in
past
days
is
responsible
for
the
present
state
of
things
but
these
are
merely
three
hypotheses
i
proceed
to
mention
three
facts
which
point
in
the
same
direction
that
the
water
used
to
issue
at
a
higher
level
firstly
there
is
that
significant
name
fontana
rotta
the
broken
fountain
does
not
this
suggest
that
its
flow
may
have
been
interrupted
or
intercepted
in
former
times
next
if
you
climb
up
from
this
fontana
rotta
to
the
village
by
the
footpath
you
will
observe
on
your
right
hand
as
you
ascend
the
slope
at
about
a
hundred
yards
below
the
church
of
saint
anthony
an
old
well
standing
in
a
field
of
corn
and
shaded
by
three
walnuts
and
an
oak
this
well
is
still
running
and
was
described
to
me
as
molto
antico
therefore
an
underground
stream
in
diminished
volume
no
doubt
still
descends
from
the
heights
thirdly
in
the
village
you
will
notice
an
alley
leading
out
of
the
corso
manfredi
one
rejoices
to
find
the
name
of
manfred
surviving
in
these
lands
an
alley
which
is
entitled
vico
sirene
the
name
arrests
your
attention
for
what
have
the
sirens
to
do
in
these
inland
regions
nothing
whatever
unless
they
existed
as
ornamental
statuary
statuary
such
as
frequently
gives
names
to
streets
in
italy
witness
the
street
of
the
faun
in
ouida
novel
or
that
of
the
giant
in
naples
which
has
now
been
it
strikes
me
as
a
humble
but
quite
scholarly
speculation
to
infer
that
the
chief
decorative
uses
of
sirens
being
that
of
fountain
deities
this
obscure
roadway
keeps
alive
the
tradition
of
the
old
fontana
grande
ornamented
we
may
suppose
with
marble
sirens
whose
site
is
now
forgotten
and
whose
very
name
has
faded
from
the
memory
of
the
countryfolk
what
then
does
my
ramble
of
two
hours
at
san
gervasio
amount
to
it
shows
that
there
is
a
possibility
at
least
of
a
now
vanished
fountain
having
existed
on
the
heights
where
it
might
fulfil
more
accurately
the
conditions
of
horace
ode
if
ughelli
church
at
the
bandusian
fount
stood
on
this
eminence
well
i
shall
be
glad
to
corroborate
for
once
in
the
way
old
ughelli
whose
book
contains
a
deal
of
dire
nonsense
and
if
the
abbe
chaupy
suggestion
that
the
village
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
should
ever
prove
to
be
wrong
well
his
amiable
ghost
may
be
pleased
to
think
that
even
this
does
not
necessitate
the
sacrifice
of
his
venosa
theory
in
favour
of
that
of
the
scholiast
akron
there
is
still
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
but
whether
this
at
san
gervasio
is
the
actual
fountain
hymned
by
horace
ah
that
is
quite
another
affair
few
poets
to
be
sure
have
clung
more
tenaciously
to
the
memories
of
their
childhood
than
did
he
and
virgil
and
yet
the
whole
scene
may
be
a
figment
of
his
imagination
the
very
word
bandusia
may
have
been
coined
by
him
who
can
tell
then
there
is
the
digentia
hypothesis
i
know
it
i
know
it
i
have
read
some
of
its
defenders
and
consider
entre
nous
that
they
have
made
out
a
pretty
strong
case
but
i
am
not
in
the
mood
for
discussing
their
proposition
not
just
now
here
at
san
gervasio
i
prefer
to
think
only
of
the
roman
singer
so
sanely
jovial
and
of
these
waters
as
they
flowed
limpid
and
cool
in
the
days
when
they
fired
his
boyish
fancy
deliberately
i
refuse
to
hear
the
charmer
boissier
deliberately
moreover
i
shut
my
eyes
to
the
present
condition
of
affairs
to
the
herd
of
squabbling
laundresses
and
those
other
incongruities
that
spoil
the
antique
scene
why
not
the
timid
alone
are
scared
by
microscopic
discords
of
time
and
place
the
sage
can
invest
this
prosaic
with
all
its
pristine
dignity
and
romance
by
an
unfailing
expedient
he
closes
an
eye
it
is
an
art
he
learns
early
in
life
a
simple
art
and
one
that
greatly
conduces
to
happiness
the
ever
alert
the
conscientiously
wakeful
how
many
fine
things
they
fail
to
see
horace
knew
the
wisdom
of
being
genially
unwise
of
closing
betimes
an
eye
or
an
ear
or
both
in
loco
viii
tillers
of
the
soil
i
remember
watching
an
old
man
stubbornly
digging
a
field
by
himself
he
toiled
through
the
flaming
hours
and
what
he
lacked
in
strength
was
made
up
in
the
craftiness
born
of
long
love
of
the
soil
the
ground
was
baked
hard
but
there
was
still
a
chance
of
rain
and
the
peasants
were
anxious
not
to
miss
it
knowing
this
kind
of
labour
i
looked
on
from
my
arbour
with
admiration
but
without
envy
i
asked
whether
he
had
not
children
to
work
for
him
all
dead
and
health
to
you
he
replied
shaking
his
white
head
dolefully
and
no
grandchildren
all
americans
emigrants
he
spoke
in
dreamy
fashion
of
years
long
ago
when
he
too
had
travelled
sailing
to
africa
for
corals
to
holland
and
france
yes
and
to
england
also
but
our
dockyards
and
cities
had
faded
from
his
mind
he
remembered
only
our
men
bella
gioventù
che
bella
gioventù
a
sturdy
brood
he
kept
on
repeating
and
lately
he
added
america
has
been
discovered
he
toiled
fourteen
hours
a
day
and
he
was
years
old
apart
from
that
creature
of
fiction
the
peasant
whom
we
all
know
i
can
find
little
to
admire
in
this
whole
class
of
men
whose
talk
and
dreams
are
of
the
things
of
the
soil
and
who
knows
of
nothing
save
the
regular
interchange
of
summer
and
winter
with
their
unvarying
tasks
and
rewards
none
save
a
cincinnatus
or
garibaldi
can
be
ennobled
by
the
spade
in
spleenful
moments
it
seems
to
me
that
the
most
depraved
of
has
flashes
of
enthusiasm
and
never
experienced
by
this
shifty
retrogressive
and
ungenerous
brood
which
lives
like
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
has
learnt
all
too
much
of
their
logic
but
they
have
a
hereabouts
which
compels
respect
contentment
in
adversity
in
this
point
they
resemble
the
russian
peasantry
and
yet
who
can
pity
the
moujik
his
cheeks
are
altogether
too
round
and
his
morals
too
superbly
bestial
he
has
clearly
been
created
to
sing
and
starve
by
turns
but
the
italian
peasant
who
speaks
in
the
tongue
of
homer
and
virgil
and
boccaccio
is
easily
invested
with
a
halo
of
martyrdom
it
is
delightful
to
sympathize
with
men
who
combine
the
manners
of
louis
quatorze
with
the
profiles
of
augustus
or
plato
and
who
still
recall
in
many
of
their
traits
the
pristine
life
of
odyssean
days
thus
they
wear
the
identical
clouted
leggings
of
oxhide
against
the
scratches
of
the
thorns
which
old
laertes
bound
about
his
legs
on
the
upland
farm
in
ithaka
they
call
them
galandrine
on
occasions
of
drought
or
flood
there
is
not
a
word
of
complaint
i
have
known
these
men
and
women
for
thirty
years
and
have
yet
to
hear
a
single
one
of
them
grumble
at
the
weather
it
is
not
indifference
it
is
true
philosophy
acquiescence
in
the
inevitable
the
grievances
of
cultivators
of
lemons
and
wholesale
agriculturalists
whose
speculations
are
often
ruined
by
a
single
stroke
of
the
human
pen
in
the
shape
of
new
regulations
or
tariffs
are
a
different
thing
curses
are
loud
and
long
but
the
dependent
chiefly
on
wind
and
weather
only
speak
of
god
will
they
have
the
same
forgiveness
for
the
shortcomings
of
nature
as
for
a
wayward
child
and
no
wonder
they
are
distrustful
ages
of
oppression
and
misrule
have
passed
over
their
heads
sun
and
rain
with
all
their
caprice
have
been
kinder
friends
to
them
than
their
earthly
masters
some
day
presumably
the
government
will
wake
up
to
the
fact
that
italy
is
not
an
industrial
country
and
that
its
farmers
might
profitably
be
taken
into
account
again
but
a
change
is
upon
the
land
types
like
this
old
man
are
becoming
extinct
for
the
patriarchal
system
of
coriolanus
the
glory
of
southern
italy
is
breaking
up
this
is
not
the
fault
of
conscription
which
though
it
destroys
old
dialects
beliefs
and
customs
widens
the
horizon
by
bringing
fresh
ideas
into
the
family
and
generally
sound
ones
it
does
even
more
it
teaches
the
conscripts
to
read
and
write
so
that
it
is
no
longer
as
dangerous
to
have
dealings
with
a
man
who
possesses
these
accomplishments
as
in
the
days
when
they
were
the
prerogative
of
and
other
questionable
characters
a
countryman
nowadays
may
read
and
write
and
yet
be
honest
what
is
shattering
family
life
is
the
speculative
spirit
born
of
emigration
a
continual
coming
and
going
of
the
adolescent
and
adult
male
population
are
at
this
moment
in
argentina
or
the
united
states
some
as
far
afield
as
new
zealand
men
who
formerly
reckoned
in
sous
now
talk
of
thousands
of
francs
parental
authority
over
boys
is
relaxed
and
the
girls
ever
quick
to
grasp
the
advantages
of
money
lose
all
discipline
and
steadiness
my
sons
wo
touch
a
spade
said
a
peasant
to
me
and
when
i
thrash
them
they
complain
to
the
police
they
simply
gamble
and
drink
waiting
their
turn
to
sail
if
i
were
to
tell
you
the
beatings
used
to
get
sir
you
would
believe
me
you
would
believe
me
not
if
i
took
my
oath
you
would
i
can
feel
them
still
speaking
with
respect
here
these
emigrants
generally
stay
away
three
or
four
years
at
a
stretch
and
then
return
spend
their
money
and
go
out
again
to
make
more
others
remain
for
longer
periods
coming
back
with
huge
incomes
twenty
to
a
hundred
francs
a
day
such
examples
produce
the
same
effect
as
those
of
the
few
lucky
winners
in
the
state
lottery
every
one
talks
of
them
and
forgets
the
large
number
of
less
fortunate
speculators
meanwhile
the
land
suffers
the
is
an
instance
this
beautiful
and
almost
eternal
growth
the
hope
of
the
southern
apennines
as
professor
savastano
calls
it
whose
pods
constitute
an
important
article
of
commerce
and
whose
leaves
yield
a
cool
shelter
comparable
to
that
of
a
rocky
cave
in
the
noonday
heat
used
to
cover
large
tracts
of
south
italy
indifferent
to
the
scorching
rays
of
the
sun
flourishing
on
the
stoniest
declivities
and
sustaining
the
soil
in
a
marvellous
manner
it
was
planted
wherever
nothing
else
would
grow
a
distant
but
sure
profit
nowadays
carobs
are
only
cut
down
although
their
produce
rises
in
value
every
year
not
one
is
planted
nobody
has
time
to
wait
for
the
fruit
footnote
there
are
a
few
laudable
exceptions
such
as
prince
belmonte
who
has
covered
large
stretches
of
bad
land
with
this
tree
see
consular
reports
italy
no
but
he
is
not
a
peasant
it
is
nothing
short
of
a
social
revolution
depopulating
the
country
of
its
most
laborious
elements
emigrants
left
in
one
year
alone
in
the
province
of
basilicata
the
exodus
exceeds
the
birthrate
i
do
not
know
the
percentage
of
those
who
depart
never
to
return
but
it
must
be
considerable
the
land
is
full
of
chronic
things
will
doubtless
right
themselves
in
due
course
it
stands
to
reason
that
in
this
acute
transitional
stage
the
demoralizing
effects
of
the
new
system
should
be
more
apparent
than
its
inevitable
benefits
already
these
are
not
unseen
houses
are
springing
up
round
villages
and
the
emigrants
return
home
with
a
disrespect
for
many
of
their
country
institutions
which
under
the
circumstances
is
neither
deplorable
nor
unjustifiable
a
large
family
of
once
a
dire
calamity
is
now
the
soundest
of
investments
soon
after
their
arrival
in
america
they
begin
sending
home
rations
of
money
to
their
parents
the
old
farm
prospers
once
more
the
daughters
receive
decent
dowries
i
know
farmers
who
receive
over
three
pounds
a
month
from
their
sons
in
america
all
under
military
age
we
work
yes
they
will
then
tell
you
but
we
also
smoke
our
pipe
previous
to
this
wholesale
emigration
things
had
come
to
such
a
pass
that
the
landed
proprietor
could
procure
a
labourer
at
a
franc
a
day
out
of
which
he
had
to
feed
and
clothe
himself
it
was
little
short
of
slavery
the
roles
are
now
reversed
and
while
landlords
are
impoverished
the
rich
emigrant
buys
up
the
farms
or
makes
his
own
terms
for
work
to
be
done
wages
being
trebled
a
new
type
of
peasant
is
being
evolved
independent
of
family
fatherland
or
traditions
with
a
sure
haven
of
refuge
across
the
water
when
life
at
home
becomes
intolerable
yes
a
change
is
at
hand
and
another
of
those
things
which
emigration
and
the
new
order
of
affairs
are
surely
destroying
is
that
ancient
anthropomorphic
way
of
looking
at
nature
with
its
expressive
turns
of
speech
a
small
boy
whom
i
watched
gathering
figs
last
year
informed
me
that
the
was
delle
pietre
e
cisterne
of
stones
and
cisterns
meaning
that
its
roots
are
searchingly
destructive
to
masonry
and
display
a
fabulous
intuition
for
the
proximity
of
water
he
also
told
me
what
was
news
to
me
that
there
are
more
than
two
or
three
varieties
of
figs
will
you
have
his
list
of
them
here
it
is
there
is
the
arnese
the
smallest
of
all
and
the
santillo
both
of
which
are
best
when
dried
the
vollombola
which
is
never
dried
because
it
only
makes
the
spring
fruit
the
molegnano
which
ripens
as
late
as
the
end
of
october
and
must
be
eaten
fresh
the
coretorto
from
its
shape
which
has
the
most
leathery
skin
of
all
and
is
often
destroyed
by
grubs
after
rain
the
troiano
the
arzano
and
the
vescovo
which
appears
when
all
the
others
are
over
and
is
eaten
in
february
this
may
be
the
kind
referred
to
in
stamer
dolce
napoli
as
deriving
from
sorrento
where
the
first
tree
of
its
kind
was
discovered
growing
out
of
the
garden
wall
of
the
bishop
palace
whence
the
name
all
these
are
now
for
the
white
kinds
the
has
a
tender
skin
but
is
easily
spoilt
by
rain
and
requires
a
ridiculous
amount
of
sun
to
dry
it
ihe
is
also
better
fresh
the
is
often
attacked
by
grubs
but
grows
to
a
large
size
every
two
or
three
years
the
is
good
up
till
christmas
the
natalino
lastly
the
whose
name
i
will
not
record
though
it
would
be
an
admirable
illustration
of
that
same
anthropomorphic
turn
of
mind
the
and
he
added
are
the
varieties
which
are
cut
into
two
and
laid
lengthwise
upon
each
other
and
so
dried
query
is
not
this
the
duplex
ficus
of
horace
of
course
there
are
other
kinds
he
said
but
i
do
remember
them
just
now
when
i
asked
whether
he
could
tell
these
different
apart
by
the
leaves
and
stems
alone
and
without
the
fruit
he
said
that
each
kind
even
in
winter
retained
its
peculiar
faccia
face
but
that
some
varieties
are
more
easy
to
distinguish
than
others
i
enquired
into
the
mysteries
of
caprification
and
learned
that
artificial
ripening
by
means
of
a
drop
of
oil
is
practised
with
some
of
them
chiefly
the
vollombola
and
then
he
gave
me
an
account
of
the
prices
for
the
different
qualities
and
seasons
which
would
have
astonished
a
grocer
all
of
which
proves
how
easy
it
is
to
misjudge
of
folks
who
although
they
do
not
know
that
paris
is
the
capital
of
france
yet
possess
a
training
adapted
to
their
present
needs
they
are
specialists
for
things
of
the
earth
it
is
a
pleasure
to
watch
them
grafting
vines
and
olives
and
lemons
with
the
precision
of
a
trained
horticulturist
they
talk
of
governing
governare
their
soil
it
is
the
word
they
use
in
respect
to
a
child
now
figs
are
neither
white
nor
black
but
such
is
the
terminology
stones
are
white
or
black
prepared
olives
are
white
or
black
wine
is
white
or
black
are
they
become
because
impregnated
from
earliest
infancy
with
a
perennial
blaze
of
rainbow
hues
in
fact
or
from
negligence
attention
to
this
matter
not
bringing
with
it
any
material
advantage
excepting
that
which
is
profoundly
interesting
from
an
artistic
and
ethnological
point
of
view
why
does
not
some
scholar
bring
old
mimica
degli
antichi
up
to
date
few
things
are
more
worthy
of
investigation
than
the
of
these
people
of
blue
they
have
not
the
faintest
conception
probably
because
there
are
so
few
blue
solids
in
nature
max
mueller
holds
the
idea
of
blue
to
be
quite
a
modern
acquisition
on
the
part
of
the
human
race
so
a
cloudless
sky
is
declared
to
be
quite
white
i
once
asked
a
lad
as
to
the
colour
of
the
sea
which
at
the
moment
was
of
the
most
brilliant
sapphire
hue
he
pondered
awhile
and
then
said
pare
come
fosse
un
colore
morto
a
sort
of
dead
colour
green
is
a
little
better
known
but
still
chiefly
connected
with
things
not
out
of
doors
as
a
green
handkerchief
the
reason
may
be
that
this
tint
is
too
common
in
nature
to
be
taken
note
of
or
perhaps
because
their
chain
of
association
between
green
and
grass
is
periodically
broken
up
our
fields
are
always
verdant
but
theirs
turn
brown
in
summer
trees
they
sometimes
call
yellow
as
do
some
ancient
writers
but
more
generally
or
a
beech
in
full
leaf
has
been
described
to
me
as
black
rosso
does
not
mean
red
but
rather
dun
or
dingy
earth
is
when
our
red
is
to
be
signified
they
will
use
the
word
turco
which
came
in
with
the
of
which
the
turks
once
monopolized
the
secret
thus
there
are
turkish
apples
and
turkish
potatoes
but
turco
may
also
mean
black
in
accordance
with
the
tradition
that
the
turks
the
saracens
were
a
black
race
snakes
generally
in
these
parts
are
described
as
either
white
or
black
an
is
a
kestrel
quasi
the
mixed
colours
of
cloths
or
silks
are
either
beautiful
or
ugly
and
there
an
end
of
it
it
is
curious
to
compare
this
state
of
affairs
with
that
existing
in
the
days
of
homer
who
was
as
it
were
feeling
his
way
in
a
new
region
and
the
propriety
of
whose
colour
epithets
is
better
understood
when
one
sees
things
on
the
spot
of
course
i
am
only
speaking
of
the
humble
peasant
whose
blindness
for
the
rest
is
not
incurable
one
might
enlarge
the
argument
and
deduce
his
odd
insensibility
to
delicate
scents
from
the
fact
that
he
thrives
in
an
atmosphere
saturated
with
violent
odours
of
all
kinds
his
dullness
in
regard
to
finer
shades
of
sound
from
the
shrieks
of
squalling
babies
and
other
domestic
explosions
in
which
he
lives
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
that
is
why
these
people
have
no
nerves
terrific
bursts
of
din
such
as
the
pandemonium
of
piedigrotta
stimulate
them
in
the
same
way
that
others
might
be
stimulated
by
a
quartette
of
brahms
and
if
they
who
are
so
concerned
about
the
massacre
of
small
birds
in
this
country
would
devote
their
energies
to
the
invention
of
a
noiseless
and
yet
cheap
powder
their
efforts
would
at
last
have
some
prospects
of
success
for
it
is
not
so
much
the
joy
of
killing
as
the
pleasurable
noise
of
the
gun
which
creates
these
local
sportsmen
as
the
sagacious
ultramontain
observed
long
ago
le
napolitain

he
says
parce
que
les
coups
de

oreille
footnote
i
have
looked
him
up
in
jos
blanc
bibliographic
his
name
was
c
haller
this
ingenuous
love
of
noise
may
be
connected
in
some
way
with
their
rapid
nervous
discharges
i
doubt
whether
intermediate
convulsions
have
left
much
purity
of
greek
blood
in
south
italy
although
emotional
travellers
fresh
from
the
north
are
for
ever
discovering
classic
hellenic
profiles
among
the
people
there
is
certainly
a
scarce
type
which
for
want
of
a
better
hypothesis
might
be
called
greek
of
delicate
build
and
below
the
average
height
and
with
curly
hair
that
varies
from
blonde
to
what
italians
call
it
differs
not
only
from
the
robuster
and
yet
fairer
northern
breed
but
also
from
the
darker
surrounding
races
but
so
many
contradictory
theories
have
lately
been
promulgated
on
this
head
that
i
prefer
to
stop
short
at
the
preliminary
question
did
a
hellenic
type
ever
exist
no
more
probably
than
that
charming
race
which
the
artists
of
japan
have
invented
for
our
delectation
strains
of
greek
blood
can
be
traced
with
certainty
by
their
track
of
folklore
and
poetry
and
song
such
as
still
echoes
among
the
vales
of
sparta
and
along
the
bosphorus
greek
words
are
rather
rare
here
and
those
that
one
hears
such
as
caruso
crisommele
have
long
ago
been
garnered
by
scholars
like
de
grandis
moltedo
and
salvatore
mele
so
naples
is
far
more
hellenic
in
dialect
lore
song
and
gesture
than
these
regions
which
are
still
rich
in
pure
latinisms
of
speech
such
as
surgere
to
arise
scitare
excitare
to
arouse

disappearing
under
the
standardizing
influence
of
conscription
emigration
and

schooling
and
soon
enough
the
become
a
thing
of
the
past
i
shall
be
sorry
to
see
it
go
though
it
has
often
driven
me
nearly
crazy
what
is
a
the
same
as
a
it
is
a
nickname
which
as
with
the
russian
peasants
takes
the
place
of
christian
and
surname
together
a
man
will
tell
you
my
name
is
luigi
but
they
call
me
by
i
do
know
my
surname
some
of
these
nicknames
are
intelligible
such
as
which
refers
to
the
profession
of
building
those
walls
without
mortar
which
are
always
tumbling
down
and
being
repaired

a

appearance
who
is
so
uncivilized
or
cristoforo
colombo
because
he
is
so
very
wideawake
but
eighty
per
cent
of
them
are
quite
obscure
even
to
their
owners
going
back
as
they
do
to
some
forgotten
trick
or
incident
during
childhood
or
to
some
pet
name
which
even
in
the
beginning
meant
nothing
nearly
every
man
and
boy
has
his
contranome
by
which
and
which
alone
he
is
known
in
his
village
the
women
seldomer
unless
they
are
conspicuous
by
some
peculiarity
such
as
the
spy
or
the
fat
one
whose
counterpart
in
the
male
sex
would
be
conceive
now
what
trouble
it
entails
to
find
a
man
in
a
strange
village
if
you
happen
not
to
know
his
contranome
and
how
on
earth
are
you
to
discover
it
if
his
surname
means
nothing
to
the
inhabitants
and
his
christian
name
is
shared
by
a
hundred
others
for
they
have
an
amazing
lack
of
inventiveness
in
this
matter
four
or
five
christian
names
will
include
the
whole
population
of
the
place
ten
to
one
you
will
lose
a
day
looking
for
him
unless
something
like
this
takes
place
you
set
forth
your
business
to
a
crowd
of
villagers
that
have
collected
around
it
is
simple
enough
you
want
to
speak
to
luigi
a
individual
who
seems
particularly
anxious
to
help
summarizes
affairs
by
saying
the
gentleman
wants
luigi
there
is
evidently
some
joke
in
the
mere
suggestion
of
such
a
thing
they
all
smile
then
a
confused
murmur
of
voices
goes
up
luigi
luigi
now
which
luigi
does
he
mean
you
repeat
his
surname
in
a
loud
voice
it
produces
no
effect
beyond
that
of
increased
hilarity
luigi
luigi
perhaps
perhaps
or
the
figlio
d
the
individual
volunteers
to
beat
the
surrounding
district
and
bring
in
all
the
luigis
he
can
find
after
half
an
hour
they
begin
to
arrive
one
by
one
he
is
not
among
them
dismissed
with
cigars
as
compensation
for
loss
of
time
meanwhile
half
the
village
has
gathered
around
vastly
enjoying
the
fun
which
it
hopes
will
last
till
bedtime
you
are
getting
bewildered
new
people
flock
in
from
the
fields
to
whom
the
mysterious
joke
about
luigi
must
be
explained
luigi
luigi
they
begin
again
now
which
of
them
can
he
mean
perhaps
or
i
never
thought
of
him
says
the
individual
here
boy
run
and
tell
that
a
foreign
gentleman
wants
to
give
him
a
cigar
by
the
time
appears
on
the
scene
the
crowd
has
thickened
you
explain
the
business
for
the
fiftieth
time
no
he
is
luigi
of
course
but
not
the
right
luigi
which
he
regrets
considerably
then
the
joke
is
made
clear
to
him
and
he
laughs
again
you
have
lost
all
your
nerve
but
the
villagers
are
beginning
to
love
you
can
it
be
or
the
figlio
d
it
might
be
the
liar
he
dead
so
he
is
i
quite
forgot
well
then
it
must
be
the
husband
of
the
flirt
he
in
prison
but
how
about
suddenly
a
withered
hag
croaks
authoritatively
i
know
the
gentleman
wants
chorus
of
villagers
then
why
does
he
say
so
lives
far
far
away
an
hour
elapses
at
last
he
comes
full
of
bright
expectations
no
this
is
not
your
luigi
he
is
another
luigi
you
are
ready
to
sink
into
the
earth
but
there
is
no
escape
the
crowd
surges
all
around
the
news
having
evidently
spread
to
neighbouring
hamlets
luigi
luigi
let
me
see
it
might
be
more
likely
i
have
it
it
i
never
thought
of
him
says
a
voice
here
boy
run
and
tell
or
never
mind
the
g
d
son
of
b
says
a
cheery
person
in
excellent
english
who
has
just
arrived
on
the
scene
see
here
i
live
fifteen
years
in
brooklyn
damn
fine
a
glass
of
wine
round
my
place
your
luigi
in
america
sure
and
if
he
is
send
him
to
hell
sound
advice
this
what
his
surname
anyhow
he
goes
on
you
explain
once
more
why
there
the
very
man
you
looking
for
there
standing
right
in
front
of
you
he
luigi
and
that
his
surname
right
enough
he
know
it
himself
you
bet
and
he
points
to
the
individual
these
countryfolk
can
fare
on
strange
meats
a
boy
consumed
a
snake
that
was
lying
dead
by
the
roadside
a
woman
ate
thirty
raw
eggs
and
then
a
plate
of
maccheroni
a
man
swallowed
six
kilograms
of
the
uncooked
fat
of
a
freshly
slaughtered
pig
he
was
ill
for
a
week
afterwards
another
one
devoured
two
small
birds
alive
with
beaks
claws
and
feathers
such
deeds
are
sternly
reprobated
as
savagery
still
they
occur
and
nearly
always
as
the
result
of
wagers
i
wish
i
could
couple
them
with
equally
heroic
achievements
in
the
drinking
line
but
alas
i
have
only
heard
of
one
old
man
who
was
wont
habitually
to
litres
of
wine
a
day
eight
are
spoken
of
as
almost
too
much
in
these
degenerate
days
mice
says
movers
were
sacrificially
eaten
by
the
babylonians
here
as
in
england
they
are
cooked
into
a
paste
and
given
to
children
to
cure
a
certain
complaint
to
take
away
the
dread
of
the
sea
from
young
boys
they
mix
into
their
food
small
fishes
which
have
been
devoured
by
larger
ones
and
taken
from
their
stomachs
the
underlying
idea
being
that
these
fry
are
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
storms
and
perils
of
the
deep
and
will
communicate
these
virtues
to
the
boys
who
eat
them
it
is
the
same
principle
as
that
of
giving
chamois
blood
to
the
of
the
alps
to
strengthen
their
nerves
against
giddiness
pure
sympathetic
magic
of
which
there
is
this
at
least
to
be
said
that
its
fundamental
conception
is
identical
with
that
of
modern
science
a
faith
in
the
order
or
uniformity
of
nature
i
have
also
met
persons
who
claim
to
have
been
cured
of
rachitic
troubles
in
their
youth
by
eating
a
puppy
dog
cooked
in
a
saucepan
but
only
one
kind
of
dog
is
good
for
this
purpose
to
be
procured
from
those
foundling
hospitals
whither
hundreds
of
illegitimate
infants
are
taken
as
soon
as
possible
after
birth
the
mothers
to
relieve
the
discomfort
caused
by
this
forcible
separation
from
the
buy
a
certain
kind
of
puppy
there
bring
them
home
and
nourish
them
loco
these
puppies
cost
a
franc
apiece
and
are
generally
destroyed
after
performing
their
duties
it
is
they
who
are
cooked
for
curing
the
scrofulous
tendencies
of
other
children
swallows
hearts
are
also
used
for
another
purpose
so
is
the
blood
of
tortoises
for
strengthening
the
backs
of
children
the
tortoise
being
a
animal
so
is
that
of
snakes
who
are
held
up
by
head
and
tail
and
pricked
with
needles
the
greater
their
pain
the
more
beneficial
their
blood
which
is
soaked
up
with
and
applied
as
a
liniment
for
swollen
glands
in
fact
nearly
every
animal
has
been
discovered
to
possess
some
medicinal
property
but
of
the
charm
of
such
creatures
the
people
know
nothing
how
different
from
the
days
of
old
these
legendary
and
gracious
beasts
that
inspired
poets
and
artists
and
glyptic
engravers
these
things
of
beauty
have
now
descended
into
the
realm
of
mere
usefulness
into
the
pharmacopoeia
the
debasement
is
quite
intelligible
when
one
remembers
what
accumulated
miseries
these
provinces
have
undergone
memories
of
refinement
were
starved
out
of
the
inhabitants
by
centuries
of
misrule
when
nothing
was
of
interest
or
of
value
save
what
helped
to
fill
the
belly
the
work
of
bestialization
was
carried
on
by
the
despotism
of
spanish
viceroys
and
bourbons
they
the
spaniards
fostered
and
perhaps
imported
the
camorra
that
monster
of
many
heads
which
has
established
itself
in
nearly
every
town
of
the
south
of
the
deterioration
in
taste
coincident
with
this
period
i
lately
came
across
this
little
bit
of
evidence
curious
and
conclusive
in
a
number
of
the
were
captured
in
one
of
the
usual
corsair
raids
they
were
afterwards
ransomed
and
among
the
christian
names
of
the
women
i
note
livia
fiula
cassandra
aurelia
lucrezia
verginia
medea
violanta
galizia
vittoria
diamanta
etc
where
were
these
noble
names
two
centuries
later
where
are
they
nowadays
do
they
not
testify
to
a
state
of
culture
superior
to
that
of
the
present
time
when
maria
lucia
and
about
four
others
of
the
most
obvious
catholic
saints
exhaust
the
list
of
all
female
christian
names
hereabouts
all
this
is
changing
once
more
a
higher
standard
of
comfort
is
being
evolved
though
relics
of
this
former
state
of
insecurity
may
still
be
found
such
as
the
absence
even
in
houses
of
good
families
of
clocks
and
watches
and
convenient
storage
for
clothes
and
domestic
utensils
their
habits
of
living
in
penury
and
of
buying
their
daily
food
by
farthings
as
though
one
never
knew
what
the
next
day
might
bring
their
dread
of
going
out
of
doors
by
night
they
have
a
proverb
which
runs
notte
non
parlar
forte
di
giorno
guardati
their
lack
of
humour
for
humour
is
essentially
a
product
of
ease
and
nobody
can
be
at
ease
in
unquiet
times
that
is
why
so
few
poets
are
humorous
their
restlessly
querulous
nature
has
the
same
effect
on
their
outlook
as
an
insecure
environment
but
it
will
be
long
ere
these
superstitions
are
eradicated
the
magic
of
south
italy
deserves
to
be
well
studied
for
the
country
is
a
cauldron
of
demonology
wherein
oriental
beliefs
imported
direct
from
egypt
the
classic
home
of
witchcraft
commingled
with
those
of
the
west
a
foreigner
is
at
an
unfortunate
disadvantage
if
he
asks
questions
he
will
only
get
answers
dictated
by
suspicion
or
a
deliberate
desire
to
mislead
prudent
answers
whoso
accepts
these
explanations
in
good
faith
might
produce
a
wondrous
contribution
to
ethnology
wise
women
and
wizards
abound
but
they
are
not
to
be
compared
with
that
near
naples
whom
i
used
to
visit
in
the
nineties
and
who
was
so
successful
in
the
magics
that
the
bishop
of
pozzuoli
among
hundreds
of
other
clients
was
wont
to
drive
up
to
her
door
once
a
week
for
a
consultation
these
mostly
occupy
themselves
with
the
manufacture
of
charms
for
gaining
lucky
lottery
numbers
and
for
deluding
fond
women
who
wish
to
change
their
lovers
the
lore
of
herbs
is
not
much
studied
for
bruises
a
slice
of
the
opuntia
is
applied
or
the
cooling
parietaria
known
as
pareta
or
paretene
the
camomile
and
other
common
remedies
are
in
vogue
the
virtues
of
the
male
fern
the
rue
sabina
and
ergot
of
rye
are
well
known
but
not
employed
to
the
extent
they
are
in
russia
where
a
large
progeny
is
a
disaster
there
is
a
certain
respect
for
the
legitimate
unborn
and
even
in
cases
of
illegitimacy
some
neighbouring
foundling
hospital
the
house
of
the
madonna
is
much
more
convenient
it
is
a
true
monk
expedient
it
avoids
the
risk
of
criminal
prosecution
the
only
difference
being
that
the
mother
of
god
and
not
the
natural
mother
of
the
infant
becomes
responsible
for
its
prompt
and
almost
inevitable
destruction
footnote
the
scandals
that
occasionally
arise
in
connection
with
that
saintly
institution
the
foundling
hospital
at
naples
are
enough
to
make
humanity
shudder
of
children
living
under
its
motherly
care
during
died
in
the
course
of
that
one
three
survived
a
wholesale
massacre
these
murdered
children
were
carried
forward
in
the
books
as
still
living
and
the
institution
which
has
a
yearly
revenue
of
over
francs
was
debited
with
their
maintenance
while
doctors
instead
of
the
prescribed
number
of
continued
to
draw
salaries
for
their
services
to
these
innocents
that
had
meanwhile
been
starved
and
tortured
to
death
the
official
report
on
these
horrors
ends
with
the
words
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
these
facts
are
peculiar
to
the
year
that
the
moon
stands
in
sympathetic
relations
with
living
vegetation
is
a
fixed
article
of
faith
among
the
peasantry
they
will
prune
their
plants
only
when
the
satellite
is
waxing
sottile
detta
luna
as
they
say
altogether
the
moon
plays
a
considerable
part
in
their
lore
as
might
be
expected
in
a
country
where
she
used
to
be
worshipped
under
so
many
forms
the
dusky
markings
on
her
surface
are
explained
by
saying
that
the
moon
used
to
be
a
woman
and
a
baker
of
bread
her
face
gleaming
with
the
reflection
of
the
oven
but
one
day
she
annoyed
her
mother
who
took
up
the
brush
they
use
for
sweeping
away
the
ashes
and
smirched
her
face
whoever
reviews
the
religious
observances
of
these
people
as
a
whole
will
find
them
a
jumble
of
contradictions
and
incongruities
lightly
held
and
as
lightly
dismissed
theirs
is
the
attitude
of
mind
of
little
children
of
those
i
mean
who
have
been
so
saturated
with
bible
stories
and
fairy
tales
that
they
cease
to
care
whether
a
thing
be
true
or
false
if
it
only
amuses
for
the
moment
that
is
what
makes
them
an
ideal
prey
for
the
quack
physician
they
will
believe
anything
so
long
as
it
is
strange
and
complicated
a
straightforward
doctor
is
not
listened
to
they
want
that
concerning
whom
a
french
writer
i
forget
his
name
has
wisely
discoursed
i
once
recommended
a
young
woman
who
was
bleeding
at
the
nose
to
try
the
homely
remedy
of
a
cold
key
i
thought
she
would
have
died
of
laughing
the
expedient
was
too
absurdly
simple
to
be
efficacious
the
attitude
of
the
clergy
in
regard
to
popular
superstitions
is
the
same
here
as
elsewhere
they
are
too
wise
to
believe
them
and
too
shrewd
to
discourage
the
belief
in
others
these
things
can
be
turned
to
account
for
keeping
the
people
at
a
conveniently
low
level
of
intelligence
for
the
rest
these
priests
are
mostly
good
fellows
of
the
type
who
would
rather
cultivate
their
own
potatoes
than
quarrel
about
vestments
or
the
trinity
violently
acquisitive
of
course
like
most
southerners
i
know
a
parish
priest
a
son
of
poor
parents
who
by
dint
of
sheer
energy
has
amassed
a
fortune
of
half
a
million
francs
he
can
not
endure
idleness
in
any
shape
and
a
fine
mediaeval
scene
may
be
witnessed
when
he
suddenly
appears
round
the
corner
and
catches
his
workmen
wasting
their
time
and
his
money
ha
loafers
rogues
villains
vermin
and
sons
of
cornuti
if
god
had
not
given
me
these
garments
and
thereby
closed
my
lips
to
all
seizing
his
cassock
and
displaying
half
a
yard
of
purple
stocking
would
i
just
tell
you
spawn
of
adulterous
assassins
what
i
think
of
you
but
under
the
new
regime
these
priests
are
becoming
mere
decorative
survivals
that
look
well
enough
in
the
landscape
but
are
not
taken
seriously
save
in
their
and
capacities
the
intense
realism
of
their
religion
is
what
still
keeps
it
alive
for
the
poor
in
spirit
their
saints
and
devils
are
on
the
same
familiar
footing
towards
mankind
as
were
the
old
gods
of
greece
children
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
inferno
they
call
it
casa
del
diavolo
the
devil
house
and
if
they
are
naughty
the
mother
says
la
madonna
strilla
the
madonna
will
scold
here
is
a
legend
of
saint
peter
interesting
for
its
realism
and
because
it
has
been
grafted
upon
a
very
ancient
the
apostle
peter
was
a
dissatisfied
sort
of
man
who
was
always
grumbling
about
things
in
general
and
suggesting
improvements
in
the
he
thought
himself
cleverer
even
than
one
day
they
were
walking
together
in
an
olive
orchard
and
peter
said
just
look
at
the
trouble
and
time
it
takes
to
collect
all
those
miserable
little
olives
let
have
them
the
size
of
melons
very
well
have
your
way
friend
peter
but
something
awkward
is
bound
to
happen
it
always
does
you
know
with
those
improvements
of
yours
and
sure
enough
one
of
these
enormous
olives
fell
from
the
tree
straight
on
the
saint
head
and
ruined
his
new
hat
i
told
you
so
said
i
remember
a
woman
explaining
to
me
that
the
saints
in
heaven
took
their
food
exactly
as
we
do
and
at
the
same
hours
the
same
food
i
asked
does
the
madonna
really
eat
beans
beans
not
likely
but
fried
fish
and
beefsteaks
of
veal
i
tried
to
picture
the
scene
but
the
effort
was
too
much
for
my
hereditary
puritan
leanings
unable
to
rise
to
these
heights
of
realism
i
was
rated
a
pagan
for
my
spirituality
est
servie
ix
moving
southwards
the
train
conveying
me
to
taranto
was
to
halt
for
the
night
at
the
second
station
beyond
venosa
at
aware
of
this
fact
i
had
enquired
about
the
place
and
received
assuring
reports
as
to
its
hotel
accommodation
but
the
fates
were
against
me
on
my
arrival
in
the
late
evening
i
learnt
that
the
hotels
were
all
closed
long
ago
the
townsfolk
having
gone
to
bed
with
the
chickens
it
was
suggested
that
i
had
better
stay
at
the
station
where
the
manageress
of
the
restaurant
kept
certain
sleeping
quarters
specially
provided
for
travellers
in
my
predicament
presently
the
gentle
dame
lighted
a
dim
lantern
and
led
me
across
what
seemed
to
be
a
marsh
it
was
raining
to
the
door
of
a
hut
which
was
to
be
my
at
the
entrance
she
paused
and
after
informing
me
that
a
band
of
musicians
had
taken
all
the
beds
save
one
which
was
at
my
disposal
if
i
were
good
enough
to
pay
her
half
a
franc
she
placed
the
lantern
in
my
hand
and
stumbled
back
into
the
darkness
i
stepped
into
a
low
chamber
the
beds
of
which
were
smothered
under
a
profusion
of
miscellaneous
wraps
the
air
was
warm
the
place
exhaled
an
indescribable
de
groping
further
i
reached
another
apartment
vaulted
and
still
lower
than
the
last
an
possibly
converted
into
a
bedroom
one
glance
sufficed
me
the
couch
was
plainly
not
to
be
trusted
thankful
to
be
out
of
the
rain
at
least
i
lit
a
pipe
and
prepared
to
pass
the
weary
hours
till
it
was
not
long
ere
i
discovered
that
there
was
another
bed
in
this
den
opposite
my
own
and
judging
by
certain
undulatory
and
saltatory
movements
within
it
was
occupied
presently
the
head
of
a
youth
emerged
with
closed
eyes
and
flushed
features
he
indulged
in
a
series
of
groans
and
spasmodic
kicks
that
subsided
once
more
only
to
recommence
a
flute
projected
from
under
his
pillow
this
poor
young
man
i
thought
is
plainly
in
bad
case
on
account
of
illness
he
has
been
left
behind
by
the
rest
of
the
band
who
have
gone
to
spinazzola
to
play
at
some
marriage
festival
he
is
feverish
or
possibly
subject
to
fits
to
choriasis
or
who
knows
what
disorder
of
the
nervous
system
a
cruel
trick
to
leave
a
suffering
youngster
alone
in
this
foul
hovel
i
his
symptoms
that
anguished
complexion
and
delirious
intermittent
trembling
and
began
to
run
over
the
scanty
stock
of
household
remedies
contained
in
my
bag
wondering
which
of
them
might
apply
to
his
complaint
there
was
court
plaster
and
boot
polish
quinine
corrosive
sublimate
and
worcester
sauce
detestable
stuff
but
indispensable
hereabouts
just
as
i
had
decided
in
favour
of
the
he
gave
a
more
than
usually
vigorous
jerk
sat
up
in
bed
and
opening
his
eyes
remarked
those
fleas
this
then
was
the
malady
i
enquired
why
he
had
not
joined
his
companions
he
was
tired
he
said
tired
of
life
in
general
and
of
in
particular
tired
moreover
of
certain
animals
and
with
a
spring
he
leapt
out
of
bed
once
thoroughly
awake
he
proved
an
amiable
talker
though
oppressed
with
an
incurable
melancholy
which
no
amount
of
tobacco
and
venosa
wine
could
dispel
in
gravely
boyish
fashion
he
told
me
of
his
life
and
ambitions
he
had
passed
a
high
standard
at
school
but
what
would
you
every
post
was
crowded
he
liked
music
and
would
gladly
take
it
up
as
a
profession
if
anything
could
be
learnt
with
a
band
such
as
his
he
was
sick
utterly
sick
of
everything
above
all
things
he
wished
to
travel
visions
of
america
floated
before
his
mind
where
was
the
money
to
come
from
besides
there
was
the
military
service
looming
close
at
hand
and
then
a
widowed
mother
at
home
the
inevitable
mother
with
a
couple
of
little
sisters
how
shall
a
man
desert
his
family
he
was
born
on
a
farm
on
the
murge
the
watershed
between
this
country
and
the
adriatic
thinking
of
the
murge
that
shapeless
and
dismal
range
of
limestone
hills
whose
name
suggests
its
sad
monotony
i
began
to
understand
the
origin
of
his
pagan
wistfulness
happy
foreigners
such
was
his
constant
refrain
happy
foreigners
who
can
always
do
exactly
what
they
like
tell
me
something
about
other
countries
he
said
something
true
anything
anything
to
cheer
him
up
i
replied
with
improbable
tales
of
indian
life
of
rajahs
and
diamonds
of
panthers
whose
eyes
shine
like
moonbeams
in
the
dark
jungle
of
elephants
huge
as
battleships
of
sportive
monkeys
who
tie
knots
in
each
others
tails
and
build
themselves
huts
among
the
trees
where
they

to

ah
that
the
curse
of
humanity
he
was
almost
smiling
when
at
there
resounded
a
furious
knocking
at
the
door
and
the
rest
of
the
band
appeared
from
their
unknown
quarters
in
the
liveliest
of
spirits
altogether
a
memorable
night
but
at
four
the
lantern
was
extinguished
and
the
cavern
bereft
of
its
glamour
resolved
itself
into
a
prosaic
and
infernally
unclean
hovel
issuing
from
the
door
i
saw
those
murky
recesses
invaded
by
the
uncompromising
light
of
dawn
and
shuddered
the
railway
journey
soon
dispelled
the
phantoms
of
the
night
as
the
train
sped
downhill
the
sun
rose
in
splendour
behind
the
murge
hills
devouring
mists
so
thickly
couched
that
struck
by
the
first
beams
they
glistered
like
compact
while
their
shaded
portions
might
have
been
mistaken
for
stretches
of
mysterious
swamp
from
which
an
occasional
clump
of
emerged
black
and
these
dreamland
effects
lasted
but
a
brief
time
and
soon
the
whole
face
of
the
landscape
was
revealed
an
arid
region
not
unlike
certain
parts
of
northern
africa
yet
the
line
passes
through
places
renowned
in
history
who
would
not
like
to
spend
a
day
at
altamura
if
only
in
memory
of
its
treatment
by
the
ferocious
cardinal
ruffo
and
his
army
of
after
a
heroic
but
vain
resistance
comparable
only
to
that
of
saguntum
or
petelia
during
which
every
available
metal
and
even
money
was
converted
into
bullets
to
repel
the
assailers
there
followed
a
three
days
slaughter
of
young
and
old
then
the
cardinal
blessed
his
army
and
pronounced
in
the
streets
a
general
absolution
even
this
man
has
discovered
apologists
no
cause
so
vile
that
some
human
being
will
not
be
found
to
defend
it
so
much
i
called
to
mind
that
morning
from
the
pages
of
colletta
and
straightway
formed
a
resolution
to
slip
out
of
the
carriage
and
arrest
my
journey
at
altamura
for
a
couple
of
days
but
i
must
have
been
asleep
while
the
train
passed
through
the
station
nor
did
i
wake
up
again
till
the
blue
ionian
was
in
sight
at
venosa
one
thinks
of
roman
legionaries
fleeing
from
hannibal
of
horace
of
norman
ambitions
lucera
and
manfredonia
call
up
saracen
memories
and
the
ephemeral
gleams
of
gargano
takes
us
back
into
byzantine
mysticism
and
monkery
and
now
from
altamura
with
its
dark
record
of
bourbon
horrors
we
glide
into
the
sunshine
of
hellenic
days
when
the
wise
archytas
sage
and
lawgiver
friend
of
plato
ruled
this
ancient
city
of
tarentum
a
wide
sweep
of
history
and
if
those
periclean
times
be
not
remote
enough
yonder
lies
oria
on
its
hilltop
the
stronghold
of
and
almost
legendary
messapians
while
for
such
as
desire
more
recent
associations
there
is
the
albanian
colony
of
san
giorgio
only
a
few
miles
distant
to
recall
the
glories
of
scanderbeg
and
his
adventurous
bands
herein
lies
the
charm
of
travel
in
this
land
of
multiple
civilizations
the
layers
of
culture
one
encounters
their
wondrous
juxtaposition
my
previous
experiences
of
taranto
hotels
counselled
me
to
take
a
private
room
overlooking
the
inland
sea
the
southern
aspect
is
already
intolerably
hot
and
to
seek
my
meals
at
restaurants
and
in
such
a
one
i
have
lived
for
the
last
ten
days
or
so
reviving
old
memories
the
place
has
grown
in
the
interval
indeed
if
one
may
believe
certain
persons
the
population
has
increased
from
thirty
to
ninety
thousand
in
i
forget
how
few
years
the
arsenal
brings
movement
into
the
town
it
has
appropriated
the
lion
share
of
building
sites
in
the
new
town
is
it
a
ripple
on
the
surface
of
things
or
will
it
truly
stir
the
spirits
of
the
city
so
many
arsenals
have
come
and
gone
at
taranto
this
arsenal
quarter
is
a
fine
example
of
the
italian
mania
of
figura
for
effect
it
is
an
agglomeration
of
dreary
streets
haunted
by
legions
of
clamorous
black
swifts
and
constructed
on
the
rectangular
principle
dear
to
the
latin
mind
modern
and
surpassingly
monotonous
are
such
interminable
rows
of
stuccoed
barracks
artistic
to
look
upon
are
they
really
pleasant
to
inhabit
is
it
reasonable
or
even
sanitary
in
a
climate
of
eight
months
sunshine
to
build
these
enormous
roadways
and
squares
filled
with
glaring
limestone
dust
that
blows
into
one
eyes
and
almost
suffocates
one
these
saharas
that
even
at
the
present
season
of
the
year
early
june
can
not
be
traversed
comfortably
unless
one
wears
brown
spectacles
and
goes
veiled
like
a
tuareg
this
arsenal
quarter
must
be
a
hell
during
the
really
not
season
which
continues
into
october
for
no
trees
whatever
are
planted
to
shade
the
walking
population
as
in
paris
or
cairo
or
any
other
sunlit
city
and
who
could
guess
the
reason
an
englishman
at
least
would
never
bring
himself
to
believe
what
is
nevertheless
a
fact
namely
that
if
the
streets
are
converted
into
shady
boulevards
the
rents
of
the
houses
immediately
fall
when
trees
are
planted
the
lodgers
complain
and
finally
emigrate
to
other
quarters
the
experiment
has
been
tried
at
naples
and
elsewhere
and
always
with
the
same
result
up
trees
down
rents
the
tenants
refuse
to
be
deprived
of
their
chief
pleasure
in
life
that
of
gazing
at
the
who
must
be
good
enough
to
walk
in
the
sunshine
for
their
delectation
but
if
you
are
of
an
inquisitive
turn
of
mind
you
are
quite
at
liberty
to
return
the
compliment
and
to
study
from
the
outside
the
most
intimate
details
of
the
tenants
lives
within
take
your
fill
of
their
domestic
doings
stare
your
hardest
they
do
mind
in
the
least
not
they
that
feeling
of
privacy
which
the
northerner
fosters
doggedly
even
in
the
centre
of
a
teeming
city
is
alien
to
their
hearts
they
like
to
look
and
be
looked
at
they
live
like
fish
in
an
aquarium
it
is
a
result
of
the
whole
that
every
one
knows
his
neighbour
business
better
than
his
own
what
does
it
matter
in
the
end
are
we
not
all
christians
the
municipality
meanwhile
is
deeply
indebted
for
the
ambitions
which
have
culminated
in
the
building
of
this
new
quarter
to
meet
these
obligations
the
octroi
prices
have
been
raised
to
the
highest
pitch
by
the
city
fathers
this
octroi
is
farmed
out
and
produces
they
tell
me
pounds
a
day
there
are
some
hundred
posts
at
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
the
average
salary
of
their
officials
is
three
pounds
a
month
they
are
supposed
to
be
respectable
and
honest
men
but
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
a
family
can
be
supported
on
that
wage
when
one
knows
how
high
the
rents
are
and
how
severely
the
most
ordinary
commodities
of
life
are
taxed
i
endeavoured
to
obtain
photographs
of
the
land
as
it
looked
ere
it
was
covered
by
the
arsenal
quarter
but
in
vain
nobody
seems
to
have
thought
it
worth
while
preserving
what
would
surely
be
a
notable
economic
document
for
future
generations
out
of
sheer
curiosity
i
also
tried
to
procure
a
plan
of
the
old
quarter
that
labyrinth
of
humanity
where
the
streets
are
often
so
narrow
that
two
persons
can
barely
squeeze
past
each
other
i
was
informed
that
no
such
plan
had
ever
been
drawn
up
it
was
agreed
that
a
map
of
this
kind
might
be
interesting
and
suggested
furthermore
that
i
might
undertake
the
task
myself
the
authorities
would
doubtless
appreciate
my
labours
we
foreigners
be
it
understood
have
ample
means
and
unlimited
leisure
and
like
nothing
better
than
doing
unprofitable
jobs
of
this
kind

one
is
glad
to
leave
the
scintillating
desert
of
this
arsenal
quarter
and
enter
the
cool
streets
of
the
other
which
remind
one
somewhat
of
malta
in
the
days
of
this
city
possessed
only
inhabitants
and
outdid
even
the
customary
italian
filth
being
hardly
passable
on
account
of
the
excessive
nastiness
and
stink
it
is
now
scrupulously
clean
so
absurdly
clean
that
it
has
quite
ceased
to
be
picturesque
not
that
its
buildings
are
particularly
attractive
to
me
none
that
is
save
the
antique
trinità
column
of
doric
gravity
sole
survivor
of
hellenic
taras
which
looks
wondrously
out

its
modern

of
the
finest
of
these
earlier

the

lovers
of
the

may
visit
the
shrine
of
saint
cataldo
a
jovial
nightmare
in
stone
and
they
who
desire
a
literary
pendant
to
this
fantastic
structure
should
read
the
life
of
the
saint
written
by
morone
in
like
the
shrine
it
is
the
quintessence
of
insipid
exuberance
there
is
something
preposterous
in
its
very
title
cataldiados
and
whoever
reads
through
those
six
books
of
latin
hexameters
will
arise
from
the
perusal
somehow
or
other
it
dislocates
one
whole
sense
of
terrestrial
values
to
see
a
frowsy
old
monk
footnote
this
wandering
irish
missionary
is
supposed
to
have
died
here
in
the
seventh
century
and
they
who
are
not
satisfied
with
his
printed
biographies
will
find
one
in
manuscript
of
pages
compiled
in
in
the
cuomo
library
at
naples
treated
in
the
heroic
style
and
metre
as
though
he
were
a
new
achilles
as
a
the
book
might
pass
but
it
is
deadly
serious
single
men
will
always
be
found
to
perpetrate
monstrosities
of
literature
the
marvel
is
that
an
entire
generation
of
writers
should
have
worked
themselves
into
a
state
of
mind
which
solemnly
approved
of
such
freaks
every
one
has
heard
of
the
strange
position
of
this
hoary
a
metropolis
already
in
neolithic
days
it
is
of
oval
shape
the
broad
sides
washed
by
the
ionian
sea
and
an
lagoon
bridges
connect
it
at
one
with
the
arsenal
or
new
town
and
at
the
other
with
the
commercial
quarter
it
is
as
if
some
precious
gem
were
set
in
a
ring
between
two
others
of
minor
worth
or
to
vary
the
simile
this
acropolis
with
its
alleys
is
the
throbbing
heart
of
taranto
the
arsenal
quarter
its
head
and
that
other
one
well
its
stomach
quite
an
insignificant
stomach
as
compared
with
the
head
and
corroborative
in
so
far
of
the
views
of
who
holds
that
this
hitherto
commendable
organ
ought
now
to
be
reduced
in
size
if
not
abolished
altogether
from
out
of
this
window
i
gaze
upon
the
purple
lagoon
flecked
with
warships
and
and
beyond
it
upon
the
venerable
land
of
japygia
the
heel
of
italy
that
rises
in
undulations
towards
the
adriatic
watershed
at
an
exquisite
perfume
of
flowers
and
ripe
corn
comes
wafted
into
my
room
over
the
still
waters
and
when
the
sun
rises
white
settlements
begin
to
sparkle
among
its
olives
and
vineyards
my
eyes
often
rest
upon
one
of
them
it
is
grottaglie
distant
a
few
miles
from
taranto
on
the
brindisi
line
i
must
visit
grottaglie
for
it
was
here
that
the
flying
monk
received
his
education
the
flying
monk
the
theme
is
not
inappropriate
at
this
moment
when
the
newspapers
are
ringing
with
the
aviation
contest
and
the
achievements
of
beaumont
garros
and
their
colleagues
i
have
purposely
brought
his
biography
with
me
to
on
the
spot
but
let
me
first
explain
how
i
became
acquainted
with
this
pioneer
of
aviation
it
was
an
odd
coincidence
i
had
arrived
in
naples
and
was
anxious
to
have
news
of
the
proceedings
at
a
certain
aviation
meeting
in
the
north
where
a
rather
inexperienced
friend
of
mine
had
insisted
upon
taking
a
part
the
newspaper
reports
of
these
entertainments
are
enough
to
disturb
anybody
while
admiring
the
great
achievements
of
modern
science
in
this
direction
i
wished
devoutly
at
that
particular
moment
that
flying
had
never
been
invented
and
it
was
something
of
a
coincidence
i
say
that
stumbling
in
this
frame
of
mind
down
one
of
the
unspeakable
little
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
university
my
glance
should
have
fallen
upon
an
engraving
in
a
bookseller
window
which
depicted
a
man
raised
above
the
ground
without
any
visible
means
of
support
flying
in
short
he
was
a
monk
floating
before
an
altar
a
companion
near
at
hand
was
portrayed
as
gazing
in
rapturous
wonder
at
this
feat
of
levitation
i
stepped
within
and
demanded
the
volume
to
which
this
was
the
frontispiece
the
salesman
a
old
fellow
with
incredibly
dirty
hands
and
face
began
to
explain
the
flying
monk
sir
joseph
of
copertino
a
mighty
saint
and
conjuror
or
perhaps
you
would
like
some
other
book
i
have
many
many
lives
of
here
look
at
this
one
of
the
great
egidio
for
instance
i
can
tell
you
all
about
him
for
he
raised
my
mother
from
the
dead
yes
out
of
the
grave
as
one
may
say
you
find
out
all
about
it
in
this
book
and
it
only
one
of
his
thousand
miracles
and
here
is
the
biography
of
the
renowned
giangiuseppe
a
mighty
saint
and
i
was
paying
little
heed
the
flying
monk
had
enthralled
me
an
unsuspected
pioneer
of
aviation
here
was
a
discovery
he
flew
i
queried
my
mind
reverting
to
the
triumphs
of
modern
science
why
not
the
only
reason
why
people
do
fly
like
that
nowadays
is
because
well
sir
because
they
ca
they
fly
with
machines
and
think
it
something
quite
new
and
wonderful
and
yet
it
as
old
as
the
hills
there
was
iscariot
for
example
icarus
i
mean
pure
legend
my
good
man
everything
becomes
legend
if
the
gentleman
will
have
the
goodness
to
wait
and
here
is
the
biography
of
how
much
for
joseph
of
copertino
cost
what
it
may
i
said
to
myself
that
volume
must
be
mine
he
took
it
up
and
began
to
turn
over
the
pages
lovingly
as
though
handling
some
priceless
book
of
hours
a
fine
engraving
he
observed
and
this
is
the
best
of
many
biographies
of
the
flying
monk
it
is
by
rossi
the
of
the
franciscan
order
to
which
our
monk
belonged
the
official
biography
it
might
be
called
dedicated
by
permission
to
his
holiness
pope
clemens
xiii
and
based
on
the
documents
which
led
to
the
saint
beatification
altogether
a
remarkable
volume
and
he
paused
awhile
then
continued
i
possess
a
cheaper
biography
of
him
also
with
a
frontispiece
by
montanari
which
has
the
questionable
advantage
of
being
printed
as
recently
as
and
here
is
yet
another
one
by
antonio
basile
oh
he
has
been
much
written
about
a
most
celebrated
as
to
this
of
i
could
not
with
a
good
conscience
appraise
it
at
less
than
five
francs
i
respect
your
feelings
but
five
francs
i
have
certain
scruples
of
my
own
you
know
and
it
irks
my
sense
of
rectitude
to
pay
five
francs
for
the
flying
monk
unless
you
can
supply
me
with
six
or
seven
additional
books
to
be
included
in
that
sum
twelve
sous
apiece
that
strikes
me
as
the
proper
price
of
such
literature
for
foreigners
at
least
therefore
i
have
the
great
egidio
as
well
and
montanari
life
of
the
flying
monk
and
that
other
one
by
basile
and
giangiuseppe
and
by
all
means
pray
take
your
choice
and
so
it
came
about
that
relieved
of
a
tenuous
and
very
sticky
note
and
loaded
down
with
three
biographies
of
the
flying
monk
one
of
egidio
two
of
giangiuseppe
i
had
been
hopelessly
swindled
but
there
no
man
can
bargain
in
a
hurry
and
my
eagerness
to
learn
something
of
the
life
of
this
early
airman
had
made
me
oblivious
of
the
natural
values
of
things
and
with
sundry
smaller
volumes
of
similar
import
bulging
out
of
my
pockets
i
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
hotel
promising
myself
some
new
if
not
exactly
light
reading
but
hardly
had
i
proceeded
twenty
paces
before
the
shopkeeper
came
running
after
me
with
another
formidable
bundle
under
his
arm
more
books
an
ominous
symptom
the
clearest
demonstration
of
my
defeat
i
was
already
a
marked
man
a
good
customer
it
was
humiliating
after
my
long
years
experience
of
the
south
and
there
resounded
an
unmistakable
note
of
triumph
in
his
voice
as
he
said
some
more
biographies
sir
read
them
at
your
leisure
and
pay
me
what
you
like
you
can
not
help
being
generous
i
see
it
in
your
face
i
always
try
to
encourage
polite
learning
if
that
is
what
you
think
to
decipher
in
my
features
but
it
rains
this
morning
i
added
rather
sourly
the
gentleman
is
pleased
to
joke
may
it
rain
tomorrow
a
little
shower
possibly
but
not
a
like
today
x
the
flying
monk
as
to
the
flying
monk
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
he
deserved
his
name
he
flew
being
a
monk
these
feats
of
his
were
naturally
confined
to
convents
and
their
immediate
surroundings
but
that
does
not
alter
the
facts
of
the
case
of
the
flights
that
he
took
in
the
little
town
of
more
than
seventy
says
father
rossi
whom
i
follow
throughout
are
on
record
in
the
depositions
which
were
taken
on
oath
from
after
his
death
this
is
one
of
them
for
example
stupendous
likewise
was
the
flight
or
rapture
which
he
exhibited
on
a
night
of
holy
thursday
he
suddenly
flew
towards
the
altar
in
a
straight
line
leaving
untouched
all
the
ornaments
of
that
structure
and
after
some
time
being
called
back
by
his
superior
returned
flying
to
the
spot
whence
he
had
set
out
and
another
he
flew
similarly
upon
an
olive
tree
and
there
remained
in
kneeling
posture
for
the
space
of
half
an
hour
a
marvellous
thing
it
was
to
see
the
branch
which
sustained
him
swaying
lightly
as
though
a
bird
had
alighted
upon
it
but
copertino
is
a
remote
little
place
already
famous
in
the
annals
of
miraculous
occurrences
it
can
be
urged
that
a
kind
of
enthusiasm
for
their
distinguished
may
have
tempted
the
inmates
of
the
convent
to
exaggerate
his
rare
gifts
nothing
of
the
kind
he
performed
flights
not
only
in
copertino
but
in
various
large
towns
of
italy
such
as
naples
rome
and
assisi
and
the
spectators
were
by
no
means
an
assemblage
of
ignorant
personages
but
men
whose
rank
and
credibility
would
have
weight
in
any
section
of
society
while
the
lord
high
admiral
of
castille
ambassador
of
spain
at
the
vatican
was
passing
through
assisi
in
the
year
the
custodian
of
the
convent
commanded
joseph
to
descend
from
the
room
into
the
church
where
the
admiral
lady
was
waiting
for
him
desirous
of
seeing
him
and
speaking
to
him
to
whom
joseph
replied
will
obey
but
i
do
not
know
whether
i
shall
be
able
to
speak
to
her
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
hardly
had
he
entered
the
church
and
raised
his
eyes
to
a
statue
situated
above
the
altar
when
he
threw
himself
into
a
flight
in
order
to
embrace
its
feet
at
a
distance
of
twelve
paces
passing
over
the
heads
of
all
the
congregation
then
after
remaining
there
some
time
he
flew
back
over
them
with
his
usual
cry
and
immediately
returned
to
his
cell
the
admiral
was
amazed
his
wife
fainted
away
and
all
the
onlookers
became
piously
terrified
and
if
this
does
not
suffice
to
win
credence
the
following
will
assuredly
do
so
and
since
it
was
god
wish
to
render
him
marvellous
even
in
the
sight
of
men
of
the
highest
sphere
he
ordained
that
joseph
having
arrived
in
rome
should
be
conducted
one
day
by
the
of
the
franciscan
order
to
kiss
the
feet
of
the
high
pontiff
urban
the
eighth
in
which
act
while
contemplating
jesus
christ
in
the
person
of
his
vicar
he
was
ecstatically
raised
in
air
and
thus
remained
till
called
back
by
the
general
to
whom
his
holiness
highly
astonished
turned
and
said
that
joseph
were
to
die
during
his
pontificate
he
himself
would
bear
witness
to
this
but
his
most
remarkable
flights
took
place
at
fossombrone
where
once
detaching
himself
in
swiftest
manner
from
the
altar
with
a
cry
like
thunder
he
went
like
lightning
gyrating
hither
and
thither
about
the
chapel
and
with
such
an
impetus
that
he
made
all
the
cells
of
the
dormitory
tremble
so
that
the
monks
issuing
thence
in
consternation
cried
earthquake
an
earthquake
here
too
he
cast
a
young
sheep
into
the
air
and
took
flight
after
it
to
the
height
of
the
trees
where
he
remained
in
kneeling
posture
ecstatic
and
with
extended
arms
for
more
than
two
hours
to
the
extraordinary
marvel
of
the
clergy
who
witnessed
this
this
would
seem
to
have
been
his
outdoor
record
two
hours
without
descent
to
earth
sometimes
furthermore
he
took
a
passenger
if
such
a
term
can
properly
be
applied
so
once
while
the
monks
were
at
prayers
he
was
observed
to
rise
up
and
run
swiftly
towards
the
confessor
of
the
convent
and
seizing
him
by
the
hand
he
raised
him
from
the
ground
by
supernatural
force
and
with
jubilant
rapture
drew
him
along
turning
him
round
and
round
in
a
ballo
the
confessor
moved
by
joseph
and
joseph
by
god
and
what
happened
at
assisi
is
still
more
noteworthy
for
here
was
a
gentleman
a
suffering
invalid
whom
joseph
snatched
by
the
hair
and
uttering
his
customary
cry
of
raised
himself
from
the
earth
while
he
drew
the
other
after
him
by
his
hair
carrying
him
in
this
fashion
for
a
short
while
through
the
air
to
the
intensest
admiration
of
the
spectators
the
patient
whose
name
was
chevalier
baldassarre
discovered
on
touching
earth
again
that
he
had
been
cured
by
this
flight
of
a
severe
nervous
malady
which
had
hitherto
afflicted
him
searching
in
the
biography
for
some
other
interesting
traits
of
saint
joseph
of
copertino
i
find
in
marked
contrast
to
his
virtues
a
humility
of
the
profoundest
kind
even
as
a
man
he
retained
the
exhilarating
childlike
nature
of
the
pure
in
heart
mamma
thus
he
would
speak
in
fashion
of
the
mother
of
god
mamma
is
capricious
when
i
bring
her
flowers
she
tells
me
she
does
not
want
them
when
i
bring
her
candles
she
also
does
not
want
them
and
when
i
ask
her
what
she
wants
she
says
want
the
heart
for
i
feed
only
on
hearts
what
wonder
if
the
mere
pronouncement
of
the
name
of
maria
often
sufficed
to
raise
him
from
the
ground
into
the
air
nevertheless
the
was
wont
to
creep
into
his
cell
at
night
and
to
beat
and
torture
him
and
the
monks
of
the
convent
were
terrified
when
they
heard
the
hideous
din
of
echoing
blows
and
jangling
chains
we
were
only
having
a
little
game
he
would
then
say
this
is
refreshingly
boyish
he
once
induced
a
flock
of
sheep
to
enter
the
chapel
and
while
he
recited
to
them
the
litany
it
was
observed
with
amazement
that
they
responded
at
the
proper
place
to
his
verses
he
saying
maria
and
they
answering
after
their
manner
i
am
not
disguising
from
myself
that
an
incident
like
the
may
smack
of
childishness
to
a
certain
austere
type
of
northern
puritan
childishness
but
to
go
into
this
question
of
the
relative
hilarity
and
moroseness
of
religions
would
take
us
far
afield
for
aught
i
know
it
may
at
bottom
be
a
matter
of
climatic
influences
and
there
we
can
leave
it
under
the
sunny
sky
of
italy
who
would
not
be
disposed
to
see
the
bright
side
of
things
saint
joseph
of
copertino
performed
a
variety
of
other
miracles
he
multiplied
bread
and
wine
calmed
a
tempest
drove
out
devils
caused
the
lame
to
walk
and
the
blind
to
see
all
of
which
are
duly
attested
by
on
oath
though
illiterate
he
had
an
innate
knowledge
of
ecclesiastical
dogma
he
detected
persons
of
impure
life
by
their
smell
and
sinners
were
revealed
to
his
eyes
with
faces
of
black
colour
the
turks
believe
that
on
judgment
day
the
damned
will
be
thus
marked
he
enjoyed
the
company
of
two
guardian
angels
which
were
visible
not
only
to
himself
but
to
other
people
and
like
all
too
many
saints
he
duly
fell
into
the
clutches
of
the
inquisition
ever
on
the
for
victims
pious
or
otherwise
there
is
one
little
detail
which
it
would
be
disingenuous
to
slur
over
it
is
this
we
are
told
that
saint
joseph
was
awkward
and
backward
in
his
development
as
a
child
his
used
to
laugh
at
him
for
his
staring
habits
they
called
him
and
in
the
frontispiece
to
montanari
life
of
him
which
depicts
him
as
a
bearded
man
of
forty
or
fifty
his
mouth
is
still
agape
he
was
moreover
difficult
to
teach
and
rossi
says
he
profited
very
little
by
his
lessons
and
was
of
as
a
lad
of
seventeen
he
could
not
distinguish
white
bread
from
brown
and
he
used
to
spill
break
vases
and
drop
plates
to
such
an
extent
that
the
monks
of
the
convent
who
employed
him
were
obliged
after
eight
months
probation
to
dismiss
him
from
their
service
he
was
unable
to
pass
his
examination
as
priest
at
the
age
of
he
was
ordained
by
the
bishop
of
castro
without
that
formality
all
this
points
to
a
certain
or
arrested
development
and
were
this
an
isolated
case
one
might
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
church
had
made
saint
joseph
an
object
of
veneration
on
the
same
principles
as
do
the
arabs
who
elevate
idiots
epileptics
and
otherwise
deficient
creatures
to
the
rank
of
marabouts
and
credit
them
with
supernatural
powers
but
it
is
not
an
isolated
case
the
majority
of
these
southern
saints
are
distinguished
from
the
vulgar
herd
by
idiosyncrasies
to
which
modern
physicians
give
singular
names
such
as
gynophobia
glossolalia
and
demonomania
footnote
good
examples
of
what
max
nordau
calls
are
to
be
found
in
this
biography
p
even
the
founder
of
the
flying
monk
order
the
great
francis
of
assisi
has
been
accused
of
some
mental
disorder
because
with
touching
humility
he
doffed
his
vestments
and
presented
himself
naked
before
his
creator
what
are
we
to
conclude
therefrom
the
flying
monk
resembles
saint
francis
in
more
than
one
feature
he
too
removed
his
clothes
and
even
his
shirt
and
exposed
himself
thus
to
a
crucifix
exclaiming
here
i
am
lord
deprived
of
everything
he
followed
his
prototype
further
in
that
charming
custom
of
introducing
the
animal
world
into
his
ordinary
talk
brother
wolf
sister
swallow
so
joseph
used
to
speak
of
himself
as
little
ass
and
a
pathetic
scene
was
witnessed
on
his
when
he
was
heard
to
mutter
begins
to
climb
the
mountain
is
up
has
reached
the
summit
can
go
no
further
and
is
about
to
leave
his
skin
behind
it
is
to
be
noted
in
this
connection
that
saint
joseph
of
was
born
in
a
stable
this
looks
like
more
than
a
mere
coincidence
for
the
divine
saint
francis
was
likewise
born
in
a
stable
but
why
should
either
of
these
holy
men
be
born
in
stables
a
reasonable
explanation
lies
at
hand
a
certain
japanese
statesman
is
credited
with
that
shrewd
remark
that
the
manifold
excellencies
and
diversities
of
hellenic
art
are
due
to
the
fact
that
the
greeks
had
no
old
masters
to
copy
from
no
schools
which
supplied
their
imagination
with
models
that
limit
and
smother
individual
initiative
and
one
marvels
to
think
into
what
exotic
beauties
these
southern
saints
would
have
blossomed
had
they
been
at
liberty
like
those
greeks
freely
to
indulge
their
versatile
genius
had
they
not
been
bound
to
the
wheels
of
inexorable
precedent
if
the
flying
monk
for
example
were
an
ordinary
mortal
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
being
born
in
an
omnibus
or
some
other
of
the
thousand
odd
places
where
ordinary
mortals
occasionally
are
born
but
no
as
a
franciscan
saint
he
was
obliged
to
conform
to
the
school
of
bethlehem
and
assisi
he
was
obliged
to
select
a
stable
such
is
the
force
of
tradition
joseph
of
copertino
lived
during
the
time
of
the
spanish
viceroys
and
his
fame
spread
not
only
over
all
italy
but
to
france
germany
and
poland
among
his
intimates
and
admirers
were
no
fewer
than
eight
cardinals
prince
leopold
of
tuscany
the
duke
of
bouillon
isabella
of
austria
the
infanta
maria
of
savoy
and
the
duke
of
brunswick
who
during
a
visit
to
various
courts
of
europe
in
purposely
went
to
assisi
to
see
him
and
was
there
converted
from
the
lutheran
heresy
by
the
spectacle
of
one
of
his
flights
prince
casimir
heir
to
the
throne
of
poland
was
his
particular
friend
and
kept
up
a
correspondence
with
him
after
the
death
of
his
father
and
his
own
succession
to
the
throne
towards
the
close
of
his
life
the
flying
monk
became
so
celebrated
that
his
superiors
were
obliged
to
shut
him
up
in
the
convent
of
osimo
in
close
confinement
in
order
that
his
aerial
voyages
should
not
be
disturbed
by
the
concourse
of
the
vulgar
and
here
he
expired
in
his
year
on
the
september
he
had
been
suffering
and
infirm
for
some
little
time
previous
to
that
event
but
managed
to
take
a
short
flight
on
the
very
day
preceding
his
demise
forthwith
the
evidences
of
his
miraculous
deeds
were
collected
and
submitted
to
the
inspired
examination
of
the
sacred
congregation
of
rites
in
rome
their
conscientiousness
in
sifting
and
weighing
the
depositions
is
sufficiently
attested
by
the
fact
that
ninety
years
were
allowed
to
elapse
ere
joseph
of
copertino
was
solemnly
received
into
the
number
of
the
blessed
this
occurred
in
and
though
the
date
may
have
been
accidentally
chosen
some
people
will
be
inclined
to
detect
the
hand
of
providence
in
the
ordering
of
the
event
as
a
challenge
to
voltaire
who
was
just
then
disquieting
europe
with
certain
doctrines
of
a
pernicious
nature
xi

for

me
at

males
now
in

francesco
recently
acquired
by
the
jesuits
in
the
sacristy
of
its
church
where
i
was
told
to
wait
a
slender
young
priest
was
praying
rapturously
before
some
image
and
the
clock
that
stood
at
hand
recorded
the
flight
of
twenty
minutes
ere
his
devotions
were
ended
then
he
arose
slowly
and
turned
upon
me
a
pair
of
lustrous
dreamy
eyes
as
though
awakened
from
another
world
this
was
quite
a
new
convent
he
explained
it
could
not
possibly
be
the
one
i
was
seeking
but
there
was
another
one
almost
a
ruin
and
now
converted
into
a
refuge
for
a
flock
of
poor
old
women
he
would
gladly
show
me
the
way
was
i
a
germanese
footnote
or
german
hereabouts
signifies
an
austrian
a
detested

even
at
this
distance
of

i
have
wondered
since
writing
the
above
whether
this
is
really
the
place
of
which
rossi
speaks
he
calls
it
grottole
the
difference
in
spelling
would
be
of
little
account
and
says
it
lies
not
far
distant
from
copertino
but
there
may
be
a
place
of
this
name
still
nearer
it
is
a
common
appellation
in
these
honeycombed
limestone
districts

the
of

presbyterian

we
walked
along
the
street
under
the
glowing
beams
of
midday
i
set
forth
the
object
of
my
visit
he
had
never
heard
of
the
flying
monk
it
was
astonishing
he
said
he
would
look
up
the
subject
without
delay
the
flying
monk
that
a
protestant
should
come
all
the
way
from
the
other
end
of
the
world
to
enquire
about
a
local
catholic
saint
of
whose
existence
he
himself
was
unaware
seemed
not
so
much
to
surprise
as
positively
to
alarm
him
among
other
local
curiosities
he
pointed
out
the
portal
of
the
parish
church
a
fine
but
dilapidated
piece
of
work
with
a
large
rosette
window
overhead
the
town
he
told
me
derives
its
name
from
certain
large
grottoes
wherein
the
inhabitants
used
to
take
refuge
during
saracen
raids
this
i
already
knew
from
the
pages
of
swinburne
and
sanchez
and
in
my
turn
was
able
to
inform
him
that
a
certain
frenchman
bertaux
by
name
had
written
about
the
byzantine
within
these
caves
yes
those
old
greeks
he
said
and
that
accounted
for
the
famous
ceramics
of
the
place
which
preserved
the
hellenic
traditions
in
extraordinary
purity
i
did
not
inform
him
that
hector
preconi
who
purposely
visited
grottaglie
to
study
these
potteries
was
considerably
disappointed
at
the
door
of
the
decayed
convent
my
guide
left
me
with
sundry
polite
expressions
of
esteem
i
entered
a
spacious
open
courtyard
a
well
stood
in
the
centre
of
a
bare
enclosure
whereon
in
olden
days
the
monks
may
have
cultivated
their
fruit
and
vegetables
round
this
court
there
ran
an
arched
passage
its
walls
adorned
with
frescoes
now
dim
and
faded
depicting
sacred
subjects
the
monastery
itself
was
a
sombre
maze
of
stairways
and
cells
and
corridors
all
the
free
spaces
including
the
very
roof
encumbered
with
gleaming
potteries
of
every
shape
and
size
that
are
made
somewhere
near
the
premises
i
wandered
about
this
sunless
and
cobwebby
labyrinth
the
old
woman
pensioners
flitting
round
me
like
bats
in
the
twilight
i
peered
into
many
dark
closets
which
of
them
was
it
joseph
famous
cell
he
tormented
his
body
so
continuously
and
obstinately
with
pins
needles
and
blades
of
steel
and
with
such
effusion
of
blood
that
even
now
after
entire
years
the
walls
of
his
cell
and
other
places
of
retirement
are
discoloured
and
actually
encrusted
with
blood
which
of
them
was
it
the
chamber
that
witnessed
these
atrocious
macerations
it
was
all
so
gloomy
and
forlorn
then
pushing
aside
a
door
in
these
tenebrous
regions
i
suddenly
found
myself
bathed
in
dazzling
light
a
loggia
opened
here
with
a
view
over
stretches
of
gnarled
olives
shining
all
silvery
under
the
immaculate
sky
of
noonday
and
bounded
by
the
sapphire
belt
of
the
ionian
sunshine
and
blue
sea
often
must
the
monks
have
taken
pleasure
in
this
fair
prospect
and
the
wiser
among
them
watching
the
labourers
returning
home
at
nightfall
the
children
at
play
and
all
the
happy
life
of
a
world
so
alien
to
their
own
may
well
have
heaved
a
sigh
meanwhile
a
crowd
of
citizens
had
assembled
below
attracted
by
the
unusual
novelty
of
a
stranger
in
their
town
the
simple
creatures
appeared
to
regard
my
investigations
in
the
light
of
a
good
joke
they
had
heard
of
begging
monks
and
thieving
monks
and
monks
of
another
variety
whose
peculiarities
i
dare
not
attempt
to
describe
but
a
flying
monk
no
never
the
dark
ages
said
one
of
them
the
mayor
i
dare
say
with
an
air
of
grave
authority
believe
me
dear
sir
the
days
of
such
fabulous
monsters
are
over
so
they
seem
to
be
for
the
present
no
picture
or
statue
records
the
life
of
this
flying
wonder
this
masterpiece
of
spanish
priestcraft
no
mural
tablet
in
this
land
of
commemorative
stones
has
been
erected
to
perpetuate
the
glory
of
his
signal
achievements
no
street
is
called
after
him
it
is
as
if
he
had
never
existed
on
the
contrary
by
a
queer
irony
of
fate
the
roadway
leading
past
his
convent
evokes
the
memory
of
a
misty
heathen
poet
likewise
native
of
these
favoured
regions
a
man
whose
name
joseph
of
copertino
had
assuredly
never
heard
ennius
of
whom
i
can
now
recall
nothing
save
that
one
unforgettable
line
which
begins
o
tite
tute
tati
tibi
ennius
who
never
so
much
as
tried
to
fly
but
contented
himself
with
singing
in
rather
bad
latin
of
the
things
of
this
earth
ennio
it
is
the
swing
of
the
pendulum
the
old
pagan
at
this
moment
may
be
nearer
to
our
ideals
and
aspirations
than
the
flying
monk
who
died
only
yesterday
so
to
speak
but
a
few
years
hence
who
can
tell
a
characteristic
episode
i
had
carefully
timed
myself
to
catch
the
returning
train
to
tarante
great
was
my
surprise
when
to
the
station
i
perceived
the
train
swiftly
approaching
i
raced
it
and
managed
to
jump
into
a
carriage
just
as
it
drew
out
of
the
station
the
guard
straightway
demanded
my
ticket
and
a
fine
for
entering
the
train
without
one
return
tickets
for
weighty
reasons
of
internal
administration
are
not
sold
i
looked
at
my
watch
which
showed
that
we
had
left
six
minutes
before
the
scheduled
hour
he
produced
his
it
coincided
with
my
own
no
matter
he
said
i
am
not
responsible
for
the
eccentricities
of
the
driver
who
probably
had
some
urgent
private
affairs
to
settle
at
taranto
the
fine
must
be
paid
a
took
a
more
charitable
view
of
the
case
he
suggested
that
an
inspector
of
the
line
had
been
travelling
along
with
us
and
that
the
driver
knowing
this
was
naturally
ambitious
to
show
how
fast
he
could
go
a
mile
or
so
before
reaching
tarante
the
railway
crosses
a
stream
that
flows
into
the
inland
sea
one
would
be
glad
to
believe
those
sages
who
hold
it
to
be
the
galaesus
it
rises
near
at
hand
in
a
marsh
amid
mighty
tufts
of
reeds
and
odorous
flowers
and
the
liquid
bubbles
up
in
pools
of
crystalline
transparency
deep
and
perfidious
cauldrons
overhung
by
the
trembling
soil
on
which
you
stand
these
fountains
form
a
respectable
stream
some
four
hundred
yards
in
length
another
copious
spring
rises
up
in
the
sea
near
its
mouth
but
can
this
be
the
river
whose
virtues
are
extolled
by
virgil
horace
martial
statius
propertius
strabo
pliny
varrò
and
coramella
what
a
constellation
of
names
around
these
waters
truly
praesentia
famam
as
boccaccio
says
of
the
sebethus
often
have
i
visited
this
site
and
tried
to
reconstruct
its
vanished
glories
my
enthusiasm
even
led
me
some
years
ago
to
the
town
hall
in
order
to
ascertain
its
true
official
name
and
here
they
informed
me
that
it
is
vulgarly
called
citrezze
but
the
correct
version
is
giadrezze
which
as
you
are
aware
sir
signifies
this
functionary
was
evidently
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
so
long
ago
as
the
learned
commentator
carducci
of
the
delizie
tarentine
already
sneered
at
this
popular
etymology
adding
what
is
of
greater
interest
that
in
the
time
of
our
fathers
this
region
was
covered
with
woods
and
rich
in
game
in
the
days
of
keppel
craven
the
vale
was
scantily
cultivated
with
cotton
looking
at
it
from
above
it
certainly
resembles
an
old
of
about
five
hundred
yards
in
breadth
and
i
hold
it
possible
that
the
deforestation
of
the
higher
lands
may
have
suffocated
the
original
sources
with
soil
carried
down
from
thence
and
forced
them
to
seek
a
lower
level
thus
shortening
the
stream
and
reducing
its
volume
of
water
but
who
shall
decide
if
we
follow
polybius
another
brook
at
the
further
end
of
the
inland
sea
has
more
valid
claims
to
the
title
of
galaesus
virgil
called
it
black
galaesus
a
curious
epithet
still
applied
to
water
in
italy
as
well
as
in
greece
mavromati
for
me
says
gissing
the
galaesus
is
the
stream
i
found
and
tracked
whose
waters
i
heard
mingle
with
the
little
sea
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
such
an
attitude
on
the
part
of
a
dilettante
traveller
towards
these
desperate
antiquarian
controversies
it
is
an
agreeable
promenade
from
the
giadrezze
rivulet
to
taranto
along
the
shore
of
this
inland
sea
its
clay
banks
are
full
of
shells
and
potteries
of
every
age
and
the
shallow
waters
planted
with
stakes
indicating
the
places
where
myriads
of
oysters
and
mussels
are
bred
indeed
if
you
look
at
a
map
you
will
observe
that
the
whole
of
this
lagoon
as
though
to
shadow
forth
its
signification
is
split
up
into
two
basins
like
an
opened
oyster
here
and
there
along
this
beach
are
fishermen
huts
constructed
of
which
are
smothered
under
multitudinous
ropes
of
grass
ropes
of
all
ages
and
in
every
stage
of
decomposition
some
fairly
fresh
others
dissolving
once
more
into
amorphous
bundles
of
hay
there
is
a
smack
of
the
stone
ages
of
primeval
about
these
shelters
on
the
deserted
shore
two
or
three
large
fetichistic
stones
stand
near
their
entrance
wickerwork
objects
of
dark
meaning
strew
the
ground
a
few
stakes
emerge
hard
by
out
of
the
placid
and
oozy
waters
in
such
a
cabin
methinks
dwelt
those
two
old
fishermen
of
theocritus
here
they
lived
and
slumbered
side
by
side
on
a
couch
of
sea
moss
among
the
rude
implements
of
their
craft
the
habits
of
these
fisherfolk
are
antique
because
the
incidents
of
their
calling
have
remained
unchanged
some
people
have
detected
traces
of
greek
in
the
looks
and
language
of
these
of
tarante
i
can
detect
nothing
of
the
kind
and
the
same
with
the
rest
of
the
population
hellenic
traits
have
disappeared
from
tarante
as
well
they
may
have
done
when
one
remembers
its
history
it
was
completely
latinized
under
augustus
and
though
byzantines
came
hither
under
nicephorus
phocas
benjamin
of
tudela
says
the
inhabitants
are
greeks
they
have
long
ago
become
merged
into
the
italian
element
only
the
barbers
seem
to
have
preserved
something
of
the
old
traditions
grandiloquent
and
terrible
talkers
like
the
cooks
in
athenasus
i
witnessed
an
aristophanic
scene
in
one
of
their
shops
lately
when
a
stranger
a
north
italian
some
arsenal
official
brought
a
little
boy
to
have
his
hair
cut
not
too
short
and
on
returning
from
a
brief
visit
to
the
tobacconist
next
door
found
it
cropped
much
closer
than
he
liked
but
damn
it
he
said
or
words
to
that
effect
i
told
you
not
to
cut
the
hair
too
short
the
barber
immaculate
and
imperturbable
gave
a
preliminary
bow
he
was
collecting
his
thoughts
and
his
breath
i
say
i
told
you
not
to
cut
it
too
short
it
looks
horrible
horrible
that
sir
pardon
my
frankness
is
a
matter
of
opinion
i
fully
admit
that
you
desired
the
child
hair
to
be
cut
not
too
short
those
in
fact
were
your
very
words
notwithstanding
i
venture
to
think
you
will
come
round
to
my
point
of
view
on
due
reflection
like
most
of
my
esteemed
customers
in
the
first
place
there
is
the
ethnological
aspect
of
the
question
you
are
doubtless
sufficiently
versed
in
history
to
know
that
under
the
late
regime
it
was
considered
improper
if
not
criminal
to
wear
a
moustache
well
nowadays
we
think
differently
which
proves
that
fashions
change
yes
they
change
sir
and
the
wise
man
bends
to
them
up
to
a
certain
point
of
course
up
to
a
certain
reasonable
point
but
damn
it
and
in
favour
of
my
contention
that
hair
should
be
worn
short
nowadays
i
need
only
cite
the
case
of
his
majesty
the
king
whose
august
head
we
all
know
is
clipped
like
that
of
a
racehorse
horrible
as
you
call
it
or
not
the
system
has
momentarily
the
approval
of
royalty
and
that
alone
should
suffice
for
all
loyal
subjects
to
deem
it
not
unworthy
of
imitation
next
there
are
what
one
might
describe
as
hygienic
and
climatic
considerations
summer
is
approaching
sir
and
apart
from
certain
unpleasant
risks
which
i
need
not
specify
you
will
surely
agree
with
me
that
the
solstitial
heat
is
a
needlessly
severe
trial
for
a
boy
with
long
hair
my
own
children
are
all
cropped
close
and
i
have
reason
to
think
they
are
grateful
for
it
why
not
yours
boys
may
differ
in
strength
or
complexion
in
moral
character
and
mental
attainments
but
they
are
remarkably
unanimous
as
to
what
constitutes
personal
comfort
and
it
is
obviously
the
duty
of
parents
to
consult
the
personal
comfort
of
their
offspring
within
certain
reasonable
limits
of
course
but
lastly
we
come
to
the
point
i
mean
the
aesthetic
side
of
the
matter
no
doubt
to
judge
by
some
old
pictures
such
as
those
of
the
renowned
mantegna
there
must
have
been
a
time
when
men
thought
long
hair
in
children
rather
beautiful
than
otherwise
and
i
am
not
so
rigorous
as
to
deny
a
certain
charm
to
these
portraits
a
charm
which
is
largely
due
i
fancy
to
the
becoming
costumes
of
the
period
at
the
same
time
the
stranger
did
not
trust
himself
to
listen
any
longer
he
threw
down
a
coin
and
walked
out
of
the
shop
with
his
son
muttering
something
not
very
complimentary
to
the
barber
female
relations
but
the
other
was
quite
unmoved
and
after
all
he
continued
addressing
the
door
through
which
his
visitor
had
fled
the
true
question
is
this
what
is
short
do
cut
it
too
short
you
said
vuol
dire
an
ambiguous
phrase
too
short
for
one
man
may
be
too
long
for
another
everything
is
relative
yes
gentlemen
turning
to
myself
and
his
everything
on
this
earth
is
relative
with
this
sole
exception
i
have
hitherto
garnered
no
hellenic
traits
in
taranto
visible
even
from
giadrezze
on
the
other
side
of
the
inland
sea
and
beyond
the
arsenal
there
stands
a
tall
solitary
palm
it
is
the
last
the
very
last
or
almost
the
very
last
of
a
race
of
giants
that
adorned
the
gardens
which
have
now
been
converted
into
the
new
quarter
i
imagine
it
is
the
highest
existing
palm
in
italy
and
am
glad
to
have
taken
a
likeness
of
it
ere
it
shall
have
been
cut
down
like
the
rest
of
its
fellows
taranto
was
once
celebrated
for
these
queenly
growths
which
the
saracens
brought
over
from
their
flaming
africa
the
same
fate
has
overtaken
the
trees
of
the
villa
beaumont
which
used
to
be
a
shady
retreat
but
was
bought
by
the
municipality
and
forthwith
pulizzato
cleaned
this
is
in
accordance
with
that
of
the
south
that
love
of
torturing
trees
which
causes
them
to
prune
pines
till
they
look
like
that
had
been
out
all
night
and
which
explains
their
infatuation
for
the
robinia
that
allows
itself
to
be
teased
into
any
pattern
suggested
by
their
unhealthy
phantasy
it
is
really
as
if
there
were
something
offensive
to
the
latin
mind
in
the
sight
of
a
tree
as
if
man
alone
had
the
right
of
expanding
normally
but
i
must
not
do
the
city
fathers
an
injustice
they
have
planted
two
rows
of
will
people
never
learn
that
cryptomerias
can
not
flourish
in
south
italy
instead
of
this
amateurish
gardening
why
not
consult
some
competent
professional
who
with
hibiscus
and
fifty
other
such
plants
would
soon
transform
this
favoured
spot
into
a
miniature
paradise
the
villa
beaumont
and
the
road
along
the
admiralty
canal
are
now
the
citizens
chief
places
of
disport
before
the
year
the
corso
vittorio
emmanuele
that
skirts
the
sea
on
the
south
side
of
the
old
town
was
their
sole
promenade
and
even
this
street
was
built
only
a
short
time
ago
vainly
one
conjectures
where
the
medieval
tarentines
took
the
air
it
must
have
been
like
manfredonia
at
the
present
day
this
corso
which
has
a
most
awkward
pavement
and
is
otherwise
disagreeable
as
looking
due
south
becomes
interesting
after
sunset
here
you
may
see
the
young
bloods
of
taranto
leaning
in
rows
against
the
railing
with
their
backs
to
the
sea
they
are
looking
across
the
road
whence
from
balconies
and
windows
the
fair
sex
are
displaying
their
charms
never
a
word
is
spoken
they
merely
gaze
at
each
other
like
lovesick
puppies
and
after
watching
the
performance
for
several
evenings
i
decided
in
favour
of
robuster
methods
i
decided
that
courtship
under
conditions
such
as
the
corso
supplies
can
only
be
pursued
by
the
very
young
or
the
hopelessly
infatuated
but
in
the
south
this
gazing
is
only
part
of
a
huge
game
they
are
not
really
in
love
at
all
these
excellent
young
men
not
at
all
at
all
they
know
better
they
are
only
pretending
because
it
looks
manly
we
must
revise
our
conceptions
as
to
the
of
these
southerners
no
people
are
more
fundamentally
sane
in
matters
of
the
heart
they
have
none
of
our
obfuscated
sentimentality
they
are
seldom
naively
enamoured
save
in
early
stages
of
life
it
is
then
that
small
girls
of
eight
or
ten
may
be
seen
furtively
recording
their
feelings
on
the
white
walls
of
their
lovers
houses
these
archaic
scrawls
go
straight
to
the
point
and
are
models
of
what
may
ultimately
become
in
the
communities
of
the
future
but
when
the
adolescent
and
stage
is
reached
the
missives
relapse
into
barbarous
ambiguity
they
grow
allegorical
and
wilfully
exuberant
as
a
persian
carpet
the
effigy
of
a
pierced
heart
at
the
end
with
enormous
oozing
from
it
alone
furnishing
a
key
to
the
document
so
far
they
are
in
earnest
and
it
is
the
girl
who
takes
the
lead
her
youthful
ties
these
letters
into
bundles
and
returns
them
conscientiously
in
due
course
to
their
respective
senders
seldom
does
a
boy
make
overtures
in
love
he
gets
more
of
it
than
he
knows
what
to
do
with
he
is
still
torpid
and
slightly
bored
by
all
these
attentions
but
presently
he
wakes
up
to
the
fact
that
he
is
a
man
among
men
and
the
obsession
of
looking
manly
becomes
a
part
of
his
future
artificial
and
rhetorical
from
henceforth
he
plays
to
the
gallery
reading
the
city
papers
one
would
think
that
south
italian
youths
are
the
most
creatures
in
the
world
they
are
always
trying
to
poison
themselves
for
love
sometimes
they
succeed
of
course
but
sometimes
dear
me
no
suicides
look
manly
that
is
all
they
are
part
of
the
game
the
more
sensible
youngsters
know
exactly
how
much
corrosive
sublimate
to
take
without
immediate
fatal
consequences
allowing
for
time
to
reach
the
nearest
hospital
there
the
kindly
physician
and
his
will
perform
their
duty
and
the
patient
wears
a
feather
in
his
cap
for
the
rest
of
his
life
the
majority
of
these
suicides
are
on
a
par
with
french
duels
a
harmless
institution
whereby
the
protagonists
honour
themselves
they
confer
as
it
were
a
patent
of
virility
the
country
people
are
as
warmblooded
as
the
citizens
but
they
rarely
indulge
in
suicides
because
well
there
are
no
hospitals
handy
and
the
doctor
may
be
out
on
his
rounds
it
is
too
risky
by
half
and
a
good
proportion
of
these
suicides
are
only
simulated
the
wily
victim
buys
some
innocuous
preparation
which
sends
him
into
convulsions
with
ghastly
symptoms
of
poisoning
and
after
treatment
remains
the
enviable
hero
of
a
mysterious
masculine
passion
ask
any
town
apothecary
a
doctor
friend
of
mine
lately
analysed
the
results
of
his
benevolent
exertions
upon
a
young
man
who
had
been
seen
to
drink
some
dreadful
liquid
out
of
a
bottle
and
was
carried
to
his
surgery
writhing
in
most
artistic
agonies
he
found
not
only
no
poison
but
not
the
slightest
trace
of
any
irritant
whatever
the
true
courtship
of
these
don
giovannis
of
tarante
will
be
quite
another
affair
a
cash
transaction
and
no
credit
allowed
they
will
select
a
life
partner
upon
the
advice
of
and
a
strong
committee
of
uncles
and
aunts
but
not
until
the
military
service
is
terminated
everything
in
its
proper
time
and
place
meanwhile
they
gaze
and
perhaps
even
serenade
this
looks
as
if
they
were
furiously
in
love
and
has
therefore
been
included
among
the
rules
of
the
game
youth
must
keep
up
the
poetic
tradition
of
fiery
besides
it
is
an
inexpensive
pastime
the
cinematograph
costs
forty
centimes
and
you
really
can
not
sit
in
the
barber
all
night
long
but
catch

it

of
a

nothing

i
love
you
and
love
you

illegible

molle
tarentum
one
looks
into
the
faces
of
these
tarentines
and
listens
to
their
casual
conversations
trying
to
unravel
what
manner
of
life
is
theirs
but
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
reading
into
their
characters
what
history
leads
one
to
think
should
be
there
the
upper
classes
among
whom
i
have
some
acquaintance
are
mellow
and
enlightened
it
is
really
as
if
something
of
the
honied
spirit
of
those
old
greek
sages
still
brooded
over
them
their
charm
lies
in
the
fact
that
they
are
civilized
without
being
commercialized
their
politeness
is
unstrained
their
suaveness
congenital
they
remind
me
of
that
new
england
type
which
for
western
substitutes
a
yielding
graciousness
of
disposition
so
it
is
with
persistent
gentle
upbringing
at
taranto
and
elsewhere
it
tones
the
individual
to
reposeful
sweetness
one
by
one
his
anfractuosities
are
worn
off
he
becomes
as
a
pebble
tossed
in
the
waters
smooth
burnished
and
to
outward
appearances
indistinguishable
from
his
fellows
but
i
do
not
care
about
the
ordinary
city
folk
they
have
an
air
of
elaborate
superciliousness
which
testifies
to
ages
of
systematic
they
seem
to
utter
that
hopeless
word
and
what
as
a
matter
of
fact
do
they
know
they
are
only
dreaming
in
their
little
backwater
like
the
oysters
of
the
lagoon
distrustful
of
extraneous
matter
and
oblivious
of
the
movement
in
a
world
of
men
beyond
their
shell
you
hear
next
to
nothing
of
america
that
fruitful
source
of
fresh
notions
there
is
no
emigration
to
speak
of
the
population
is
not
sufficiently
energetic
they
prefer
to
stay
at
home
nor
do
they
care
much
about
the
politics
of
their
own
country
one
sees
less
newspapers
here
than
in
most
italian
towns
our
middle
classes
said
my
friend
the
italian
deputy
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
are
like
our
mules
to
be
endurable
they
must
be
worked
thirteen
hours
out
of
the
twelve
but
these
have
no
industries
to
keep
them
awake
no
sports
no
ambitions
and
this
has
gone
on
for
long
centuries
in
taranto
it
is
always
afternoon
the
tarentines
says
strabo
have
more
holidays
than
workdays
in
the
year
and
never
was
more
completely
cut
off
from
the
country
never
was
wider
gulf
between
peasant
and
townsman
there
are
charming
walks
beyond
the
new
quarter
a
level
region
with
olives
and
figs
and
almonds
and
pomegranates
standing
in
ripe
odorous
wheat
but
the
citizens
might
be
living
at
timbuctu
for
all
they
know
of
these
things
it
rains
little
here
on
the
occasion
of
my
last
visit
not
a
drop
had
fallen
fourteen
months
and
consequently
the
country
roads
are
generally
smothered
in
dust
now
dusty
boots
are
a
scandal
and
an
offence
in
the
eyes
of
the
gentle
burghers
who
accordingly
never
issue
out
of
their
town
walls
they
have
forgotten
the
use
of
ordinary
appliances
of
country
life
such
as
thick
boots
and
you
will
not
see
them
hereabouts
unaware
of
this
idiosyncrasy
i
used
to
carry
a
stick
on
my
way
through
the
streets
into
the
surroundings
but
left
it
at
home
on
learning
that
i
was
regarded
as
a
kind
of
perambulating
earthquake
the
spectacle
of
a
man
clattering
through
the
streets
on
horseback
such
as
one
often
sees
at
venosa
would
cause
them
to
barricade
their
doors
and
prepare
for
the
last
judgment
altogether
essentially
nice
creatures
fearful
of
fuss
or
novelty
and
drowsily
satisfied
with
themselves
and
life
in
general
the
breezy
healthfulness
of
travel
the
teachings
of
art
or
science
the
joys
of
rivers
and
green
lanes
all
these
things
are
a
closed
book
to
them
their
interests
are
narrowed
down
to
the
purely
human
a
case
of
partial
atrophy
for
the
purely
human
needs
a
corrective
it
is
not
sufficiently
humbling
and
that
is
exactly
what
makes
them
so
supercilious
we
must
take
a
little
account
of
the
cosmos
nowadays
it
helps
to
rectify
our
bearings
they
have
their
history
no
doubt
but
save
for
that
one
gleam
of
periclean
sunshine
the
record
though
long
and
varied
is
sufficiently
inglorious
and
does
not
testify
to
undue
exertions
a
change
is
at
hand
gregorovius
lamented
the
filthy
condition
of
the
old
town
it
is
now
spotless
he
deplored
that
taranto
possessed
no
museum
this
again
is
changed
and
the
provincial
museum
here
is
justly
praised
though
the
traveller
may
be
annoyed
at
finding
his
favourite
rooms
temporarily
closed
is
there
any
museum
in
italy
not
partially
closed
for
alterations
new
accessions
to
its
store
are
continually
pouring
in
so
they
lately
discovered
in
a
tomb
a
hellenistic
statuette
of
eros
and
aphrodite
centimetres
high
work
of
the
third
century
the
goddess
stands
while
eros
alights
in
airy
fashion
on
her
shoulders
and
fans
her
with
his
wings
an
exquisite
little
thing
he
was
grieved
likewise
that
no
public
collection
of
books
existed
here
but
the
newly
founded
municipal
library
is
all
that
can
be
desired
the
stranger
is
cordially
welcomed
within
its
walls
and

peruse

his
leisure
old

giovan
giovene
and
the
rest
of
them
wandering
among
those
shelves
i
hit
upon
a
recent
volume
which
gave
me
more
food
for
thought
than
any
of
these
ancients
it
is
called
cose
di
puglie
and
contains
some
dozen
articles
all
by
writers
of
this
province
of
old
calabria
footnote
it
included
the
heel
of
italy
on
matters
of
exclusively
local
interest
its
history
meteorology
dialects
classical
references
to
the
country
extracts
from
old
economic
documents
notes
on
the
development
of
apulian
printing
examples
of
modern
local
caricature
descriptions
of
mediaeval
monuments
a
kind
of
anthology
in
short
of
provincial
lore
the
typography
paper
and
illustrations
of
this
remarkable
volume
are
beyond
all
praise
they
would
do
honour
to
the
best
firm
in
london
or
paris
what
is
this
book
it
is
no
commercial
speculation
at
all
it
is
a
wedding
present
to
a
newly
married
couple
a
bouquet
of
flowers
of
intellectual
blossoms
culled
from
their
native
apulian
meadows
one
notes
with
pleasure
that
the
happy
pair
are
neither
dukes
nor
princes
there
is
no
trace
of
snobbishness
in
the
offering
which
is
simply
a
spontaneous
expression
of
good
wishes
on
the
part
of
a
few
friends
but
surely
it
testifies
to
most
refined
feelings
how
immeasurably
does
this
permanent
and
yet
immaterial
feast
differ
from
our
gross
wedding
banquets
and
ponderous
gilt
clocks
and
tea
services
such
persons
can
not
but
have
the
highest
reverence
for
things
of
the
mind
such
a
gift
is
the
fairest
efflorescence
of
civilization
and
this
is
only
another
aspect
of
that
undercurrent
of
spirituality
in
south
italy
of
whose
existence
the
tourist
harassed
by
sordid
preoccupations
remains
wholly
unaware
this
book
was
printed
at
bari
bari
not
long
ago
consisted
of
a
dark
and
tortuous
old
town
exactly
like
the
citadel
of
taranto
it
has
now
its
glaring
new
quarter
not
a
whit
less
disagreeable
than
the
one
here
why
should
taranto
not
follow
suit
in
the
matter
of
culture
heraclea
sybaris
and
all
the
greek
settlements
along
this
coast
have
vanished
from
earth
only
taranto
and
cotrone
have
survived
to
carry
on
if
they
can
the
old
traditions
they
have
survived
thanks
to
peculiar
physical
conditions
that
have
safeguarded
them
from
invaders
but
these
very
conditions
have
entailed
certain
drawbacks
drawbacks
which
buckle
would
have
lovingly
enumerated
to
prove
their
influence
upon
the
habits
and
disposition
of
the
tarentines
that
marine
situation
only
think
of
three
thousand
years
of
scirocco
summer
and
winter
it
is
alone
enough
to
explain
tarentum
enough
to
drain
the
energy
out
of
a
newfoundland
puppy
and
then
the
odious
dust
of
the
country
roadways
for
it
odious
had
the
soil
been
granitic
or
even
of
the
ordinary
apennine
limestone
the
population
might
have
remained
in
closer
contact
with
wild
things
of
nature
and
retained
a
perennial
fountain
of
enjoyment
and
inspiration
a
particular
kind
of
rock
therefore
has
helped
to
make
them
sluggish
and
incurious
the
insularity
of
their
citadel
has
worked
in
the
same
direction
by
focussing
their
interests
upon
the
purely
human
that
inland
sea
again
were
it
not
an
ideal
for
the
tarentines
would
long
ago
have
learnt
to
vary
their
diet
thirty
centuries
of
can
not
but
impair
the
physical
tone
of
a
people
and
had
the
inland
sea
not
existed
the
government
would
not
have
been
tempted
to
establish
that
arsenal
which
has
led
to
the
erection
of
the
new
town
and
consequent
municipal
exactions
the
arsenal
said
a
grumbling
old
boatman
to
me
was
the
beginning
of
our
purgatory
a
milk
diet
would
work
wonders
with
the
health
and
spirits
of
the
citizens
but
since
the
building
of
the
new
quarter
such
a
diet
has
become
a
luxury
cows
and
goats
will
soon
be
scarce
as
the
megatherium
there
is
a
tax
of
a
franc
a
day
on
every
cow
and
a
herd
of
ten
goats
barely
enough
to
keep
a
poor
man
alive
must
pay
annually
francs
in
octroi
these
and
other
legalized
robberies
which
among
a
more
virile
populace
would
cause
the
mayor
and
town
council
to
be
forthwith
attached
to
the
nearest
are
patiently
borne
it
is
tarentum
a
race
without
grit
i
would
also
recommend
the
burghers
some
vegetables
so
desirable
for
their
sedentary
habits
but
there
again
it
seems
to
be
a
peculiarity
of
the
local
soil
to
produce
hardly
a
leaf
of
salad
or
cabbage
potatoes
are
plainly
regarded
as
an
exotic
they
are
the
size
of
english
peas
and
make
me
think
of
ruskin
letter
to
those
old
ladies
describing
the
asparagus
somewhere
in
tuscany
and
all
this
to
the
waiter
undisguised
astonishment
the
gentleman
is
rich
enough
to
pay
for
meat
why
trouble
about
this
kind
of
food
and
yet
a
change
is
at
hand
these
southern
regions
are
waking
up
from
their
slumber
of
ages
already
some
of
italy
acutest
thinkers
and
most
brilliant
politicians
are
drawn
from
these
shores
for
we
must
rid
ourselves
of
that
incubus
of
immutable
race
characters
think
only
of
our
race
what
has
the
englishman
of
in
common
with
that
rather
lovable
fop
drunkard
and
bully
who
would
faint
with
ecstasy
over
byron
after
pistolling
his
best
friend
in
a
duel
about
a
wench
or
a
such
differences
as
exist
between
races
of
men
exist
only
at
a
given
moment
and
what
i
sometimes
ask
myself
what
is
now
the
distinguishing
feature
between
these
southern
men
and
ourselves
briefly
this
i
think
in
mundane
matters
where
the
personal
equation
dominates
their
judgment
is
apt
to
be
turbid
and
perverse
but
as
one
rises
into
questions
of
pure
intelligence
it
becomes
serenely
impartial
we
on
the
other
hand
who
are
in
worldly
concerns
of
law
and
government
and
in
all
subsidiary
branches
of
mentality
can
not
bring
ourselves
to
reason
dispassionately
on
subjects
aussi
a
sa
pudeur
says
remy
de
gourmont
well
this
de
discouraged
among
the
highest
classes
in
england
is
the
of
respectability
hereabouts
a
very
real
difference
at
this
particular
moment
there
is
an
end
of
philosophizing
they
have
ousted
me
from
my
pleasant
quarters
the
landlady
son
and
having
returned
unexpectedly
and
claiming
their
apartments
i
have
taken
refuge
in
a
hotel
my
peace
is
gone
my
days
in
taranto
are
numbered
loath
to
depart
i
linger
by
the
beach
of
the
ionian
sea
beyond
the
new
town
it
is
littered
with
shells
and
holothurians
with
antique
tesserae
blue
glass
and
marble
fragments
with
white
mosaic
pavements
and
potteries
of
every
age
from
the
glossy
ware
whose
delicately
embossed
shell
devices
are
emblematic
of
this
city
down
to
the
grosser
products
of
yesterday
of
marbles
i
have
found
pavonazzetto
and
antico
but
no
harder
materials
such
as
porphyry
or
serpentine
this
and
the
fact
that
the
mosaics
are
pure
white
suggests
that
the
houses
here
must
have
dated
at
latest
from
augustan
times
footnote
nor
is
there
any
of
the
fashionable
and
this
points
in
the
same
direction
corsi
says
nothing
as
to
the
date
of
its
introduction
and
i
have
not
read
the
treatise
of
silenziario
but
my
own
observations
lead
me
to
think
that
the
can
hardly
have
been
known
under
tiberius
not
so
those
hard
ones
they
imported
wholesale
by
his
predecessor
augustus
who
was
anxious
to
be
known
as
a
scorner
of
luxury
a
favourite
pose
with
monarchs
yet
spent
incalculable
sums
on
ornamental
stones
both
for
public
and
private
ends
one
is
struck
by
a
certain
waste
of
material
either
the
expense
was
deliberately
disregarded
or
finer
methods
of
working
the
stones
were
not
yet
in
vogue
a
revolution
in
the
technique
of
must
have
set
in
soon
after
his
death
for
thenceforward
we
find
the
most
intractable
rocks
cut
into
slices
thin
as
too
thin
for
pavements
and
presumably
for
encrusting
walls
and
colonnades
the
augustans
unable
to
produce
these
effects
naturally
attempted
and
with
wonderful
success
i
have
a
fragment
of
their
plaster
postiche
copying
the
egyptian
granite
the
oily
lustre
of
the
quartz
is
so
fresh
and
the
peculiar
structure
of
the
rock
with
its
mica
scintillations
so
admirably
rendered
as
to
deceive
after
two
thousand
years
the
eye
of
a
trained
mineralogist
here
i
sit
on
the
tepid
shingle
listening
to
the
plash
of
the
waves
and
watching
the
sun
as
it
sinks
over
the
western
mountains
that
are
veiled
in
mists
during
the
full
daylight
but
loom
up
at
this
sunset
hour
as
from
a
fabulous
world
of
gold
yonder
lies
the
calabrian
sila
forest
the
brigands
country
i
will
attack
it
by
way
of
rossano
and
thence
wander
past
longobucco
across
the
whole
region
it
may
be
well
after
all
to
come
again
into
contact
with
streams
and
woodlands
after
this
drenching
of
classical
associations
and
formal
civic
life
near
me
stands
a
which
used
to
be
called
batteria
chianca
it
was
here
they
found
some
twenty
years
ago
a
fine
marble
head
described
as
a
venus
and
now
preserved
in
the
local
museum
i
observe
that
this
fort
has
lately
been
batteria
archyta
can
this
be
due
to
a
burst
of
patriotism
for
the
greek
who
ruled
taranto
or
is
it
a
subtle
device
to
mislead
the
foreign
spy
here
too
are
kilns
where
they
burn
the
blue
clay
into
tiles
and
vases
i
time
a
small
boy
at
work
shaping
the
former
his
average
output
is
five
tiles
in
four
minutes
including
the
carrying
to
and
fro
of
the
moist
clay
his
wages
about
a
shilling
a
day
but
if
you
wish
to
see
the
manufacture
of
more
complicated
potteries
you
must
go
to
the
unclean
quarter
beyond
the
railway
station
once
there
you
will
not
soon
weary
of
that
potter
wheel
and
the
fair
shapes
that
blossom
forth
under
its
enchanted
touch
this
ware
of
taranto
is
sent
by
sea
to
many
parts
of
south
italy
and
you
may
see
picturesque
groups
of
it
here
and
there
at
the
street
corners
hardly
has
the
sun
disappeared
before
the
lighthouse
in
the
east
begins
to
flash
the
promontory
on
which
it
stands
is
called
san
vito
after
one
of
the
musty
saints
now
almost
forgotten
whose
names
survive
along
these
shores
stoutly
this
venerable
one
defended
his
ancient
worship
against
the
radiant
and
victorious
madonna
nor
did
she
dislodge
him
from
a
certain
famous
sanctuary
save
by
the
questionable
expedient
of
adopting
his
name
she
called
herself
della
vita
that
settled
it
he
came
from
mazzara
in
sicily
whither
they
still
carry
to
his
lonely
shrine
epileptics
and
others
distraught
in
mind
and
were
i
in
a
discursive
mood
i
would
endeavour
to
trace
some
connection
between
his
establishment
here
and
the
tarantella
between
vitus
dance
and
that
other
one
which
cured
they
say
the
bite
of
the
tarentine
spider
but
i
am
not
inclined
for
such
matters
at
present
the
uplands
are
still
visible
in
the
gathering
twilight
they
draw
me
onwards
away
from
taranto
it
must
be
cool
up
there
among
the
firs
and
beeches
and
a
land
moreover
of
multiple
memories
and
interests
this
calabria
a
land
of
great
men
in
the
learned
aceti
was
able
to
enumerate
over
two
thousand
celebrated
calabrians
athletes
generals
musicians
centenarians
inventors
martyrs
ten
popes
ten
kings
as
well
as
some
sixty
conspicuous
women
a
land
of
thinkers
old
zavarroni
born
in
gives
us
a
list
of
seven
hundred
calabrian
writers
and
i
for
one
would
not
care
to
bring
his
catalogue
up
to
date
the
recently
acquired
at
naples
alone
contains
god
knows
how
many
items
nearly
all
modern
and
who
shall
recount
its
natural
attractions
says
another
old
writer
here
is
all
sorts
of
corn
sundry
wines
and
in
great
abundance
all
kinds
of
fruits
oyle
hony
wax
saffron
bombace
annis
and
coriander
seeds
there
groweth
gum
pitch
turpentine
and
liquid
storax
in
former
times
it
was
never
without
mettals
but
at
this
present
it
doth
much
abound
having
in
most
parts
divers
sorts
of
mines
as
gold
silver
iron
marble
alabaster
cristal
marchesite
three
sorts
of
white
chaulk
virmilion
alume
brimstone
and
the
adamant
stone
which
being
in
the
fifth
degree
draweth
not
iron
and
is
in
colour
black
there
groweth
hemp
and
flax
of
two
sorts
the
one
called
the
male
the
other
the
female
there
falleth
manna
from
heaven
truly
a
thing
very
rare
and
although
there
is
not
gathered
such
abundance
of
silk
yet
i
dare
say
there
is
not
had
so
much
in
all
besides
there
are
also
bathes
both
hot
and
cold
to
cure
many
diseases
near
the
seaside
and
likewise
on
the
mediterrane
are
goodly
gardens
full
of
oringes
citrons
and
lemons
of
divers
sorts
it
is
watered
with
many
rivers
there
are
on
the
hils
of
the
apennine
thick
woods
of
high
firrs
holms
platanes
oaks
where
grows
the
white
odoriferous
mushrome
which
shineth
in
the
night
here
is
bred
the
soft
stone
which
every
month
yields
a
delicate
and
wholesome
gum
and
the
stone
by
us
called
the
stone
in
this
province
there
is
excellent
hunting
of
divers
creatures
as
wild
hoggs
staggs
goats
hares
foxes
porcupines
marmosets
there
are
also
ravenous
beasts
as
wolves
bears
luzards
which
are
and
have
the
hinder
parts
spotted
with
divers
colours
this
kind
of
beast
was
brought
from
to
in
the
sports
of
the
great
and
hunters
affirm
this
beast
to
be
of
so
frail
a
memory
that
although
he
eateth
with
hunger
if
he
chance
to
look
back
remembreth
no
more
his
meat
and
departing
searcheth
for
other
who
would
not
visit
calabria
if
only
on
the
chance
of
beholding
the
speckled
posterior
of
the
luzard
xiii
into
the
jungle
this
short
plunge
into
the
jungle
was
a
relief
after
the
experiences
of
taranto
the
forest
of
policoro
skirts
the
ionian
the
railway
line
cleaves
it
into
two
unequal
portions
the
seaward
tract
being
the
smaller
it
is
bounded
on
the
west
by
the
river
sinnc
and
i
imagine
the
place
has
not
changed
much
since
the
days
when
keppel
craven
explored
its
recesses
twilight
reigns
in
this
maze
of
tall
deciduous
trees
there
is
thick
undergrowth
too
and
i
measured
an
old
lentiscus
a
shrub
in
italy
which
was
three
metres
in
circumference
but
the
exotic
feature
of
the
grove
is
its
wealth
of
creeping
vines
that
clamber
up
the
trunks
swinging
from
one
to
another
and
allowing
the
merest
threads
of
sunlight
to
filter
through
their
matted
canopy
policoro
has
the
tangled
beauty
of
a
tropical
swamp
rank
odours
arise
from
the
decaying
leaves
and
moist
earth
and
once
within
that
verdant
labyrinth
you
might
well
fancy
yourself
in
some
primeval
region
of
the
globe
where
the
foot
of
man
has
never
penetrated
yet
long
ago
it
resounded
with
the
din
of
battle
and
the
trumpeting
of
elephants
in
that
furious
first
battle
between
pyrrhus
and
the
romans
and
here
under
the
very
soil
on
which
you
stand
lies
buried
they
say
the
ancient
city
of
siris
they
have
dug
canals
to
drain
off
the
moisture
as
much
as
possible
but
the
ground
is
marshy
in
many
places
and
often
quite
impassable
especially
in
winter
none
the
less
winter
is
the
time
when
a
little
shooting
is
done
here
chiefly
wild
boars
and
they
are
driven
down
towards
the
sea
but
only
as
far
as
the
railway
line
those
that
escape
into
the
lower
portions
are
safe
for
another
year
as
this
is
never
shot
over
but
kept
as
a
permanent
preserve
i
have
been
told
that
were
introduced
ut
that
the
experiment
failed
probably
the
country
was
too
not
and
damp
in
his
account
of
calabria
duret
de
tavel
footnote
an
english
translation
of
his
book
appeared
in
sometimes
speaks
of
killing
the
an
autochthonous
tyrrhenian
beast
which
is
now
extinct
on
the
mainland
in
its
wild
state
nor
can
he
be
confounding
it
with
the
roe
since
he
mentions
the
two
together
for
instance
in
the
following
note
from
corigliano
february
which
must
make
the
modern
calabrian
mouth
water
game
has
multiplied
to
such
an
extent
that
the
fields
are
ravaged
and
we
are
rendering
a
real
service
in
destroying
it
i
question
whether
there
exists
in
europe
a
country
offering
more
varied
species
we
return
home
followed
by
carriages
and
mules
loaded
with
wild
boars
hares
pheasants
wild
duck
wild
geese
to
say
nothing
of
foxes
and
wolves
of
which
we
have
already
killed
an
immense
quantity
the
pheasants
seem
to
have
likewise
died
out
save
in
royal
preserves
they
were
introduced
into
calabria
by
that
mighty
hunter
frederick
ii
the
parcelling
out
of
many
of
these
big
properties
has
been
followed
by
a
destruction
of
woodland
and
complete
disappearance
of
game
it
is
hailed
as
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
of
prosperity
and
so
it
well
may
be
from
a
commercial
point
of
view
but
the
traveller
and
lover
of
nature
will
be
glad
to
leave
some
of
these
wild
districts
in
the
hands
of
their
rich
owners
who
have
no
great
interests
in
cultivating
every
inch
of
ground
levelling
rocky
spaces
draining
the
land
and
hewing
down
every
tree
that
fails
to
bear
fruit
split
into
peasant
proprietorships
this
forest
would
soon
become
a
scientifically
irrigated
campagna
for
the
cultivation
of
tomatoes
or
what
not
like
the
colonia
elena
near
the
pontine
marshes
the
national
exchequer
would
profit
without
a
doubt
but
i
question
whether
we
should
all
take
the
economical
point
of
view
whether
it
would
be
wise
for
humanity
to
do
so
there
is
a
prosperity
other
than
material
some
solitary
artist
or
poet
drawing
inspiration
from
scenes
like
this
might
have
contributed
more
to
the
happiness
of
mankind
than
a
legion
of
grimy
and
litigious
to
all
appearances
italy
is
infected
just
now
with
a
laudable
mania
for
the
exploitation
of
natural
resources
at
the
expense
of
course
of
wealthy
landowners
who
are
described
as
withholding
from
the
people
their
due
the
programme
sounds
reasonable
enough
but
one
must
not
forget
that
what
one
reads
on
this
subject
in
the
daily
papers
is
largely
the
campaign
of
a
class
of
irresponsible
pressmen
and
politicians
who
exploit
the
ignorance
of
weak
people
to
fill
their
own
pockets
how
one
learns
to
loathe
in
italy
and
in
england
that
lovely
word
when
one
knows
a
little
of
the
inner
workings
of
the
cause
and
a
few
just
a
few
details
of
the
private
lives
of
these
unsavoury
saviours
of
their
country
the
lot
of
the
southern
serfs
was
bad
enough
before
america
was
discovered
and
quite
unendurable
in
earlier
times
there
is
a
village
not
many
hours
from
naples
where
in
only
the
personal
attendants
of
the
feudal
lord
lived
in
ordinary
houses
the
two
thousand
inhabitants
the
serfs
took
refuge
in
caves
and
shelters
of
straw
conceive
the
conditions
in
remote
calabria
such
was
the
anguished
poverty
of
the
that
up
to
the
eighties
of
last
century
they
used
to
sell
their
children
by
regular
contracts
duly
attested
before
the
local
mayors
but
nowadays
i
listen
to
their
complaints
with
comparative
indifference
you
are
badly
treated
my
friend
i
quite
believe
it
indeed
i
can
see
it
well
go
to
argentina
and
sell
potatoes
or
to
the
mines
of
pennsylvania
there
you
will
grow
rich
like
the
rest
of
your
compatriots
then
return
and
send
your
sons
to
the
university
let
them
become
and
members
of
parliament
who
shall
harass
into
their
graves
these
wicked
owners
of
the
soil
this
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
the
career
of
a
considerable
number
of
them
for
the
rest
the
domain
of
policoro
it
is
spelt
in
older
maps
like
those
of
magini
and
seems
to
be
well
administered
and
would
repay
a
careful
study
i
was
not
encouraged
however
to
undertake
this
study
the
manager
evidently
suspecting
some
ulterior
motive
to
underlie
my
simple
questions
he
was
not
at
all
responsive
to
friendly
overtures
restive
at
first
he
soon
waxed
ambiguous
and
finally
taciturn
perhaps
he
thought
i
was
a
in
disguise
a
large
structure
combining
the
features
of
palace
fortress
and
convent
occupies
an
eminence
and
is
supposed
by
some
to
stand
on
the
site
of
old

walk
to

along
an
avenue
of
eucalypti
planted
some
forty
years
ago
detesting
as
i
do
the
whole
tribe
of
gum
trees
i
never
lose
an
opportunity
of
saying
exactly
what
i
think
about
this
particularly
odious
representative
of
the
brood
this
eyesore
this
scarecrow
this
reptile
of
a
growth
with
which
a
pack
of
misguided
enthusiasts
have
disfigured
the
entire
mediterranean
basin
they
have
now
realized
that
it
is
useless
as
a
protection
against
malaria
soon
enough
they
will
learn
that
instead
of
preventing
the
disease
it
actually
fosters
it
by
harbouring
clouds
of
mosquitoes
under
its
scraggy
foliage
these
abominations
may
look
better
on
their
native
heath
i
sincerely
hope
they
do
judging
by
the
dead
heart
of
australia
a
book
which
gave
me
a
nightmare
from
which
i
shall
never
recover
i
should
say
that
a
varnished
would
be
an
artistic
godsend
out
there
but
from
here
the
intruder
should
be
expelled
without
mercy
a
single
eucalyptus
will
ruin
the
fairest
landscape
no
plant
on
earth
rustles
in
such
a
horribly
metallic
fashion
when
the
wind
blows
through
those
everlastingly
withered
branches
the
noise
chills
one
to
the
marrow
it
is
like
the
sibilant
chattering
of
ghosts
its
oil
is
called
medicinal
only
because
it
happens
to
smell
rather
nasty
it
is
worthless
as
timber
objectionable
in
form
and
hue
objectionable
above
all
things
in
its
perverse
habits
what
other
tree
would
have
the
effrontery
to
turn
the
sharp
edges
of
its
leaves
as
if
these
were
not
narrow
enough
already
towards
the
sun
so
as
to
be
sure
of
giving
at
all
hours
of
the
day
the
minimum
of
shade
and
maximum
of
discomfort
to
mankind
but
i
confess
that
this
avenue
of
policoro
almost
reconciled
me
to
the
existence
of
the
anaemic
antipodeans
almost
since
for
some
reason
or
other
perhaps
on
account
of
the
insufferably
foul
nature
of
the
soil
their
foliage
is
here
thickly
tufted
it
glows
like
burnished
bronze
in
the
sunshine
like
enamelled
scales
of
green
and
gold
these
eucalypti
are
unique
in
italy
gazing
upon
them
my
heart
softened
and
i
almost
forgave
the
gums
their
manifold
iniquities
their
diabolical
thirst
their
demoralizing
aspect
of
precocious
senility
and
vice
their
peeling
bark
suggestive
of
unmentionable
skin
diseases
and
that
system
of
radication
which
is
nothing
short
of
a
scandal
on
this
side
of
the
globe
in
the
exuberance
of
his
joy
at
the
prospect
of
getting
rid
of
me
the
manager
of
the
estate
lent
me
a
to
convey
me
to
the
edge
as
well
as
a
boy
for
a
guide
warning
me
however
not
to
put
so
much
as
the
point
of
my
nose
inside
the
jungle
on
account
of
the
malaria
which
has
already
begun
to
infect
the
district
one
sees
all
too
many
wan
faces
hereabouts
visible
from
the
intervening
plain
is
a
large
building
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
it
is
called
acinapura
and
this
is
the
place
i
should
have
gone
to
had
time
permitted
for
the
sake
of
the
fine
view
which
it
must
afford
over
the
whole
policoro
region
herds
of
buffaloes
wallow
in
the
mire
an
old
bull
reposing
in
solitary
grandeur
allowed
me
so
near
an
approach
that
i
was
able
to
see
two
or
three
frogs
hopping
about
his
back
and
engaged
in
catching
the
mosquitoes
that
troubled
him
how
useful
if
something
equally
efficient
and
inexpensive
could
be
devised
for
humanity
we
entered
the
darksome
forest
the
boy
who
had
hitherto
confined
himself
to
monosyllables
suddenly
woke
up
under
its
mysterious
influence
he
became
alert
and
affable
he
related
thrilling
tales
of
the
outlaws
who
used
to
haunt
these
thickets
lamenting
that
those
happy
days
were
over
there
were
the
makings
of
a
brigand
in
paolo
i
stimulated
his
brave
fancy
and
it
was
finally
proposed
that
i
should
establish
myself
permanently
with
the
manager
of
the
estate
so
that
on
sundays
we
could
have
some
together
on
the
sly
then
out
again
into
the
broad
and
sunlit
bed
of
the
sinno
the
water
now
ripples
in
bland
content
down
a
waste
of
shining
pebbles
but
its
wintry
convulsions
are
terrific
and
higher
up
the
stream
where
the
banks
are
steep
many
lives
are
lost
in
those
angry
floods
that
rush
down
from
the
filling
the
riverbed
with
a
turmoil
of
crested
waves
at
such
moments
these
torrents
put
on
new
faces
from
placid
waterways
they
are
transformed
into
living
monsters
aegirs
or
dragons
that
roll
themselves
seaward
out
of
their
dark
caverns
in
tawny
coils
of
destruction
xiv
dragons
and
precisely
this
angry
aspect
of
the
waters
has
been
acclaimed
as
one
of
the
origins
of
that
idea
which
used
to
be
common
in
south
italy
before
the
blight
of
spaniardism
fell
upon
the
land
and
withered
up
the
pagan
faculty
there
are
streams
still
perpetuating
this
name
the
rivulet
dragone
for
instance
which
falls
into
the
ionian
not
far
from
cape
colonne
a
aspect
of
them
has
also
been
suggested
as
the
origin
the
tortuous
wanderings
of
rivers
in
the
plains
like
the
meander
that
recall
the
convolutions
of
the
serpent
for
serpent
and
dragon
are
apt
to
be
synonymous
with
the
ancients
both
these
explanations
i
think
are
late
developments
in
the
evolution
of
the
they
leave
one
still
puzzling
as
to
what
may
be
the
aboriginal
conception
underlying
this
legendary
beast
of
earth
and
clouds
and
waters
we
must
go
further
back
what
is
a
dragon
an
animal
one
might
say
which
looks
or
regards
greek
so
called
presumably
from
its
terrible
eyes
homer
has
passages
which
bear
out
this
interpretation
greek
smerdaleon
de
dedorken
etc
now
the
greeks
were
certainly
sensitive
to
the
expression
of
animal
eyes
witness
hera
or
the
opprobrious
epithet
altogether
the
more
we
study
what
is
left
of
their
zoological
researches
the
more
we
realize
what
close
observers
they
were
in
natural
history
aristotle
for
instance
points
out
sexual
differences
in
the
feet
of
the
crawfish
which
were
overlooked
up
to
a
short
time
ago
and
hesiod
also
insists
upon
the
dragon
eyes
yet
it
is
significant
that
the
snake
is
derived
like
from
a
root
meaning
nothing
more
than
to
perceive
or
regard
there
is
no
connotation
of
ferocity
in
either
of
the
words
gesner
long
ago
suspected
that
the
dragon
was
so
called
simply
from
its
keen
or
rapid
perception
one
likes
to
search
for
some
existing
animal
prototype
of
a
fabled
creature
like
this
seeing
that
to
invent
such
things
out
of
sheer
nothing
is
a
feat
beyond
human
ingenuity
or
at
least
beyond
what
the
history
of
others
of
their
kind
leads
us
to
expect
it
may
well
be
that
the
homeric
writer
was
acquainted
with
the
uromastix
lizard
that
occurs
in
asia
minor
and
whoever
has
watched
this
beast
as
i
have
done
can
not
fail
to
have
been
impressed
by
its
contemplative
gestures
as
if
it
were
gazing
intently
drakon
at
something
it
is
moreover
a
dweller
in
rocky
places
and
more
than
this
a
vegetarian
an
eater
of
poisonous
herbs
as
homer
somewhere
calls
his
dragon
so
aristotle
says
when
the
dragon
has
eaten
much
fruit
he
seeks
the
juice
of
the
bitter
lettuce
he
has
been
seen
to
do
this
are
we
tracking
the
dragon
to
his
lair
is
this
the
aboriginal
beast
not
at
all
i
should
say
on
the
contrary
this
is
a
mere
to
follow
which
would
lead
us
astray
the
was
invented
when
men
had
begun
to
forget
what
the
was
it
is
the
product
of
a
later
stage
the
materializing
stage
that
stage
when
humanity
sought
to
explain
in
naturalistic
fashion
the
obscure
traditions
of
the
past
we
must
delve
still
deeper
my
own
dragon
theory
is
perhaps
necessarily
so
dragons
being
somewhat
remote
animals
the
dragon
i
hold
is
the
personification
of
the
life
within
the
earth
of
that
life
which
being
unknown
and
uncontrollable
is
hostile
to
man
let
me
explain
how
this
point
is
reached
the
animal
which
or
regards
why
why
an
animal
why
not
that
which
looks
now
what
looks
the
eye
this
is
the
key
to
the
understanding
of
the
problem
the
key
to
the
subterranean
the
conceit
of
fountains
or
sources
of
water
being
things
that
see
drakon
that
is
eyes
or
bearing
some
resemblance
to
eyes
is
common
to
many
races
in
italy
for
example
two
springs
in
the
inland
sea
near
taranto
are
called
occhi
eyes
arabs
speak
of
a
watery
fountain
as
an
eye
the
notion
exists
in
england
top
in
the
blentarn
of
cumberland
the
blind
tarn
tarn
a
trickling
of
tears
which
is
blind
because
dry
and
waterless
and
therefore
lacking
the
bright
lustre
of
the
open
eye
there
is
an
eye
then
in
the
fountain
an
eye
which
looks
or
regards
and
inasmuch
as
an
eye
presupposes
a
head
and
a
head
without
body
is
hard
to
conceive
a
material
existence
was
presently
imputed
to
that
which
looked
upwards
out
of
the
liquid
depths
this
i
think
is
the
primordial
dragon
the
archetype
he
is
of
animistic
descent
and
survives
all
over
the
earth
and
it
is
precisely
this
universality
of
the
which
induces
me
to
discard
all
theories
of
local
origin
and
to
seek
for
some
common
cause
fountains
are
ubiquitous
and
so
are
dragons
there
are
fountain
dragons
in
japan
in
the
superstitions
of
keltic
races
in
the
mediterranean
basin
the
dragon
of
wantley
lived
in
a
well
the
lambton
worm
began
life
in
fresh
water
and
only
took
to
dry
land
later
on
i
have
elsewhere
spoken
of
the
manfredonia
legend
of
saint
lorenzo
and
the
dragon
an
indigenous
fable
connected
i
suspect
with
the
fountain
near
the
harbour
of
that
town
and
quite
independent
of
the
legend
of
saint
michael
various
springs
in
greece
and
italy
are
called
dragoneria
there
is
a
dragonara
on
malta
and
another
of
the
same
name
near
cape
misenum
all
are
sources
of
apposite
lore
the
so
the
dragon
has
grown
into
a
subterranean
monster
who
peers
up
from
his
dark
abode
wherever
he
can
out
of
fountains
or
caverns
whence
fountains
issue
it
stands
to
reason
that
he
is
sleepless
all
dragons
are
sleepless
their
eyes
are
eternally
open
for
the
luminous
sparkle
of
living
waters
never
waxes
dim
and
bold
adventurers
may
well
be
devoured
by
dragons
when
they
fall
into
these
watery
rents
never
to
appear
again
furthermore
since
gold
and
other
treasures
dear
to
mankind
lie
hidden
in
the
stony
bowels
of
the
earth
and
are
hard
to
attain
the
jealous
dragon
has
been
accredited
with
their
guardianship
hence
the
plutonic
element
in
his
nature
the
dragon
whose
eye
protected
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
was
the
of
the
earth
or
calabria
has
some
of
these
dragons
caves
you
can
read
about
them
in
the
of
sanchez
in
volcanic
regions
there
are
fissures
in
the
rocks
exhaling
pestiferous
emanations
these
are
the
the
of
the
dragon
within
the
dragon
legends
of
naples
and
mondragone
are
probably
of
this
origin
and
so
is
that
of
the
roman
campagna
where
the
died
from
the
effects
of
this
poisonous
breath
sometimes
the
confined
monster
issues
in
a
destructive
bellerophon
and
the
chimsera
the
or
floods
of
water
suddenly
stream
down
from
the
hills
and
fountains
are
released
it
is
the
hungry
dragon
rushing
from
his
den
in
search
of
prey
the
he
rages
among
the
mountains
with
such
swiftness
and
impetuosity
this
is
chiefly
the
poets
work
though
the
theologians
have
added
one
or
two
embellishing
touches
but
in
whatever
shape
he
appears
whether
his
eyes
have
borrowed
a
more
baleful
fire
from
heathen
basilisks
or
traits
of
moral
evil
are
instilled
into
his
pernicious
physique
by
amalgamation
with
the
apocalyptic
beast
he
remains
the
vindictive
enemy
of
man
and
his
ordered
ways
of
late
like
the
saurian
tribe
in
general
he
has
somewhat
degenerated
so
in
modern
greece
by
that
process
of
stultified
anthropomorphism
which
results
from
grafting
christianity
upon
an
alien
mythopoesis
he
dons
human
attributes
talking
and
acting
as
a
man
tozer
and
here
in
calabria
he
lingers
in
children
fables
as
sdrago

mockery
of
his
former
self

follow
up
his
wondrous
metamorphoses
through
medievalism

be

the
shop
therefore
and
purchase
a
pennyworth
of
vaseline
this
act
entitles
you
to
all
the
privileges
of
the
club
then
is
the
moment
to
take
a
seat
smiling
affably
at
the
assembled
company
but
without
proffering
a
syllable
if
this
etiquette
is
strictly
adhered
to
it
will
not
be
long
ere
you
are
politely
questioned
as
to
your
plans
your
present
accommodation
and
so
forth
and
soon
several
members
will
be
vying
with
each
other
to
procure
you
a
clean
and
comfortable
room
at
half
the
price
charged
in
a
hotel
even
when
this
end
is
accomplished
my
connection
with
the
pharmacy
coterie
is
not
severed
i
go
there
from
time
to
time
ostensibly
to
talk
but
in
reality
to
listen
here
one
can
feel
the
true
pulse
of
the
place
local
questions
are
dispassionately
discussed
with
ample
forms
of
courtesy
and
in
a
language
worthy
of
cicero
it
is
the
club
of
the
in
olden
days
i
used
to
visit
south
italy
armed
with
introductions
to
merchants
noblemen
and
landed
proprietors
i
have
quite
abandoned
that
system
as
these
people
bless
their
hearts
have
such
cordial
notions
of
hospitality
that
from
morning
to
night
the
traveller
has
not
a
moment
he
can
call
his
own
letters
to
persons
in
authority
such
as
syndics
or
police
officers
are
useless
and
worse
than
useless
like
chinese
mandarins
these
officials
are
so
puffed
up
with
their
own
importance
that
it
is
sheer
waste
of
time
to
call
upon
them
if
wanted
they
can
always
be
found
if
not
they
are
best
left
alone
for
besides
being
usually
the
least
enlightened
and
least
amiable
of
the
populace
they
are
inordinately
suspicious
of
political
or
commercial
designs
on
the
part
of
strangers
god
knows
what
visions
are
fermenting
in
their
turbid
brains
and
seldom
let
you
out
of
their
sight
once
they
have
known
you
excepting
at
cosenza
cotrone
and
catanzaro
an
average
white
man
will
seldom
find
in
any
calabrian
hostelry
what
he
is
accustomed
to
consider
as
ordinary
necessities
of
life
the
thing
is
easily
explicable
these
men
are
not
yet
in
the
habit
of
handling
civilized
travellers
they
fail
to
realize
that
is
a
business
to
be
learnt
like
tailoring
or
politics
they
are
still
in
the
patriarchal
stage
wealthy
proprietors
for
the
most
part
and
quite
independent
of
your
custom
they
have
not
learnt
the
trick
of
swiss
servility
you
must
therefore
be
prepared
to
put
up
with
what
looks
like
very
bad
treatment
on
your
entrance
nobody
moves
a
step
to
enquire
after
your
wants
you
must
begin
by
foraging
for
yourself
and
thank
god
if
any
notice
is
taken
of
what
you
say
it
is
as
if
your
presence
were
barely
tolerated
but
once
the
stranger
has
learnt
to
pocket
his
pride
and
treat
his
hosts
in
the
same
offhand
fashion
he
will
find
among
them
an
unconventional
courtesy
of
the
best
kind
the
establishment
being
run
as
a
rule
by
the
proprietor
own
family
gratuities
with
a
view
to
exceptional
treatment
are
refused
with
quiet
dignity
and
even
when
accepted
will
not
further
your
interests
in
the
least
on
the
contrary
you
are
thenceforward
regarded
as
tactless
and
weak
in
the
head
discreet
praise
of
their
native
town
or
village
is
the
best
way
to
win
the
hearts
of
the
younger
generation
for
the
parents
a
little
knowledge
of
american
conditions
is
desirable
to
prove
that
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
and
worthy
a
priori
of
some
respect
but
if
there
exists
a
he
is
generally
an
importation
and
should
be
periodically
and
liberally
bribed
without
knowledge
of
the
family
from
the
earliest
moment
wonderful
what
a
cook
can
do
it
is
customary
here
not
to
live
or
to
pay
a
fixed
price
for
any
meal
the
smallest
item
down
to
a
piece
of
bread
being
conscientiously
marked
against
you
my
system
elaborated
after
considerable
experimentation
is
to
call
for
this
bill
every
morning
and
for
the
first
day
or
two
after
arrival
dispute
in
friendly
fashion
every
item
remorselessly
cutting
down
some
of
them
not
that
they
overcharge
their
honesty
is
notorious
and
no
difference
is
made
in
this
respect
between
a
foreigner
and
a
native
it
is
a
matter
of
principle
by
this
system
which
must
not
be
overdone
your
position
in
the
house
gradually
changes
from
being
a
guest
you
become
a
friend
a
brother
for
it
is
your
duty
to
show
above
all
things
that
you
are
not
witless
the
unforgivable
sin
in
the
south
you
may
be
a
forger
or
why
not
it
is
a
vocation
like
any
other
a
vocation
for
but
whoever
can
not
take
care
of
of
his
money
is
not
to
be
trusted
in
any
walk
of
life
he
is
of
no
account
he
is
no
man
i
have
become
firm
friends
with
some
of
these
proprietors
by
the
simple
expedient
of
striking
a
few
francs
off
their
bills
and
should
i
ever
wish
to
marry
one
or
their
daughters
the
surest
way
to
predispose
the
whole
family
in
my
favour
would
be
this
method
of
amiable
but
unsmiling
contestation
of
course
the
inns
are
often
dirty
and
not
only
in
their
sleeping
accommodation
the
reason
is
that
like
turks
or
jews
their
owners
do
not
see
dirt
there
is
no
word
for
dirt
in
the
hebrew
language
they
think
it
odd
when
you
draw
their
attention
to
it
i
remember
complaining
in
one
of
my
fastidious
moments
of
a
napkin
plainly
not
my
own
which
had
been
laid
at
my
seat
there
was
literally
not
a
clean
spot
left
on
its
surface
and
i
insisted
on
a
new
one
i
got
it
but
not
before
hearing
the
proprietor
mutter
something
about
the
caprices
of
pregnant
women
the
view
from
these
my
new
quarters
at
rossano
compensates
for
divers
other
little
drawbacks
down
a
gorge
of
glowing
red
earth
decked
with
olives
and
cistus
the
eye
wanders
to
the
ionian
sea
shining
in
deepest
turquoise
tints
and
beautified
by
a
glittering
margin
of
white
sand
to
my
left
the
water
takes
a
noble
sweep
inland
there
lies
the
plain
of
sybaris
traversed
by
the
crathis
of
old
that
has
thrust
a
long
spit
of
fand
into
the
waves
on
this
side
the
outlook
is
bounded
by
the
high
range
of
pollino
and
dolcedorme
serrated
peaks
that
are
even
now
midsummer
displaying
a
few
patches
of
snow
in
the
morning
light
these
exquisite
mountains
evaporate
towards
sunset
in
an
amethystine
haze
a
restful
prospect
but
great
was
my
amazement
on
looking
out
of
the
window
during
the
night
after
my
arrival
to
observe
the
polar
star
placed
directly
over
the
ionian
sea
the
south
as
i
surely
deemed
it
a
week
has
passed
since
then
and
in
spite
of
the
map
i
have
not
quite
familiarized
myself
with
this
spectacle
nor
yet
with
that
other
one
of
the
sun
setting
apparently
due
east
over
monte
pollino
the
glory
of
rossano
is
the
image
of
the
madonna
achiropita
bartholomaeus
tells
us
in
his
life
of
saint
nilus
that
in
olden
days
she
was
wont
to
appear
clothed
in
purple
and
drive
away
with
a
divine
torch
the
saracen
invaders
of
this
town
in
more
recent
times
too
she
has
often
saved
the
citizens
from
locusts
cholera
and
other
calamitous
visitations
unlike
most
of
her
kind
she
was
not
painted
by
saint
luke
she
is
painted
by
any
human
hands
whatever
and
in
so
far
resembles
a
certain
old
image
of
the
magna
mater
her
prototype
which
was
also
of
divine
origin
it
is
generally
supposed
that
this
picture
is
painted
on
wood
not
so
says
diehl
it
is
a
fragment
of
a
fresco
on
stone
hard
by
in
the
of
the
square
is
a
marble
tablet
erected
to
the
memory
of
the
deputy
felice
cavalotti
we
all
remember
cavalotti
the
last
with
imbriani
of
the
republican
giants
a
blustering
annihilator
of
monarchs
and
popes
a
duellist
who
deserved
his
uncommon
and
unlovely
fate
he
provoked
a
colleague
to
an
encounter
and
during
a
frenzied
attack
received
into
his
open
mouth
the
point
of
his
adversary
sword
which
sealed
up
for
ever
that
fountain
of
eloquence
and
vituperation
cavalotti
and
the
virgin
achiropita
the
new
and
the
old
really
with
such
extreme
ideals
before
his
eyes
the
burghers
of
rossano
must
sometimes
wonder
where
righteousness
lies
they
call
themselves
calabrians
siamo
calabresi
they
proudly
say
meaning
that
they
are
above
suspicion
of
unfair
dealing
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
are
a
muddled
brood
and
considerably
given
to
cheating
when
there
is
any
prospect
of
success
you
must
watch
the
peasants
coming
home
at
night
from
their
if
you
wish
to
see
the
true
calabrian
type
whiskered
short
and
wiry
and
of
dark
complexion
there
is
that
indescribable
mark
of
in
these
countrymen
they
are
different
in
features
and
character
from
the
italians
it
is
an
ascetic
a
spanish
type
your
calabrian
is
strangely
scornful
of
luxury
and
even
comfort
a
creature
of
few
but
words
straightforward
indifferent
to
pain
and
suffering
and
dwelling
by
preference
when
religiously
minded
on
the
harsher
aspects
of
his
faith
a
note
of
unworldliness
is
discoverable
in
his
outlook
upon
life
dealing
with
such
men
one
feels
that
they
are
well
disposed
not
from
impulse
but
from
some
dark
sense
of
preordained
obligation
greek
and
other
strains
have
infused
versatility
and
a
more
smiling
exterior
but
the
groundwork
of
the
whole
remains
that
old
of
austere
gentlemanliness
rossano
was
built
by
the
romans
says
procopius
and
during
byzantine
days
became
a
fortress
of
primary
importance
an
older
settlement
probably
lay
by
the
seashore
and
its
harbour
is
marked
as
good
so
late
as
the
days
of
edrisius
like
many
of
these
old
calabrian
ports
it
is
now
invaded
by
silt
and
sand
though
a
few
ships
still
call
there
wishful
to
learn
something
of
the
past
glories
of
the
town
i
enquired
at
the
municipality
for
the
public
library
but
was
informed
by
the
supercilious
and
not
secretary
that
this
proud
city
possesses
no
such
institution
a
certain
priest
he
added
would
give
me
all
the
desired
information
canonico
rizzo
was
a
delightful
old
man
with
snowy
hair
and
candid
blue
eyes
nothing
it
seemed
could
have
given
him
greater
pleasure
than
my
appearance
at
that
particular
moment
he
discoursed
awhile
and
sagely
concerning
england
and
english
literature
and
then
we
passed
on
milton
to
calvin
and
the
puritan
movement
in
scotland
next
livingstone
to
colonial
enterprises
in
africa
and
finally
egypt
abyssinia
and
prester
john
to
the
early
history
of
the
eastern
churches
byzantinism
saint
nilus
that
gave
me
the
desired
opportunity
and
i
mentioned
the
object
of
my
visit
the
history
of
rossano
well
well
the
secretary
of
the
municipality
does
me
too
much
honour
you
must
read
the
book
of
genesis
and
hesiod
and
berosus
and
the
rest
of
them
but
stay
i
have
something
of
more
modern
date
in
which
you
will
find
these
ancient
authors
conveniently
classified
from
this
book
by
de
rosis
printed
in
i
gleaned
two
facts
firstly
that
the
city
of
rossano
is
now
years
old
quite
a
respectable
age
as
towns
go
and
lastly
that
in
the
year
it
had
its
own
academy
of
lettered
men
who
called
themselves
i
spensierati
with
the
motto
alunt
curai
echo
no
doubt
of
the
neapolitan
renaissance
under
alfonso
the
magnificent
the
popes
urban
viii
and
benedict
xiii
belonged
to
this
association
of
thoughtless
ones
the
work
ends
with
a
formidable
list
of
local
personages
distinguished
in
the
past
for
their
gentleness
of
birth
and
polite
accomplishments
one
wonders
how
all
these
delicately
nurtured
creatures
can
have
survived
at
rossano
if
their
sleeping
accommodation
you
might
live
here
some
little
time
before
realizing
that
this
place
which
seems
to
slope
gently
downhill
against
a
pleasing
background
of
wooded
mountains
is
capable
of
being
strongly
fortified
it
lies
like
other
inland
calabrian
and
etruscan
cities
on
ground
enclosed
by
and
one
of
these
forms
a
deep
gully
above
which
rossano
towers
on
a
smooth
and
perpendicular
precipice
the
upper
part
of
this
wall
of
rock
is
grey
sandstone
the
lower
a
bed
of
red
granitic
matter
from
this
coloured
stone
which
crops
up
everywhere
the
town
may
have
drawn
its
name
of
rossano
rosso
red
not
a
very
old
settlement
therefore
although
certain
patriotic
philologers
insist
upon
deriving
it
from
rus
sanum
healthy
country
its
older
names
were
roscia
and
ruscianum
it
is
not
marked
in
peutinger
countless
jackdaws
and
kestrels
nestle
in
this
cliff
as
well
as
clouds
of
swifts
both
alpine
and
common
these
swifts
are
the
ornithological
phenomenon
of
rossano
and
i
think
the
citizens
have
cause
to
be
thankful
for
their
existence
to
them
i
attribute
the
fact
that
there
are
so
few
flies
mosquitoes
and
other
aerial
plagues
here
if
only
the
amiable
birds
could
be
induced
to
extend
their
attentions
to
the
bedrooms
as
well
this
shady
glen
at
the
back
of
the
city
with
its
sparse
tufts
of
vegetation
and
monstrous
blocks
of
deep
red
stone
cloven
into
rifts
and
ravines
by
the
wild
waters
has
a
charm
of
its
own
there
are
undeniable
suggestions
of
hell
about
the
place
a
pathway
runs
adown
this
vale
of
hinnom
and
if
you
follow
it
upwards
to
the
junction
of
the
streams
you
will
reach
a
road
that
once
more
ascends
to
the
town
past
the
old
church
of
saint
mark
a
most
interesting
building
it
has
five
little
cupolas
but
the
interior
supported
by
eight
columns
has
been
whitewashed
the
structure
has
now
rightly
been
declared
a
national
monument
it
dates
from
the
ninth
or
tenth
century
and
according
to
bertaux
has
the
same
plan
and
the
same
dimensions
as
the
famous
cattolica
at
stilo
which
the
artistic
lear
though
he
stayed
some
time
at
that
picturesque
place
does
not
so
much
as
mention
they
say
that
this
chapel
of
saint
mark
was
built
by
euprassius
of
calabria
and
that
in
the
days
of
nilus
it
was
dedicated
to
saint
anastasius
here
at
rossano
we
are
once
more
plein
rossano
was
not
only
a
political
bulwark
the
most
formidable
citadel
of
this
byzantine
province
it
was
a
great
intellectual
centre
upon
which
literature
theology
and
art
converged
among
the
many
perverse
historical
notions
of
which
we
are
now
ridding
ourselves
is
byzantinism
in
south
italy
was
a
period
of
decay
and
torpid
dreamings
it
needed
on
the
contrary
a
resourceful
activity
to
wipe
out
as
did
those
colonists
from
the
east
every
trace
of
roman
culture
and
language
latin
rule
only
revived
at
rossano
in
the
fifteenth
century
there
was
no
lethargy
in
their
social
and
political
ambitions
in
their
military
achievements
which
held
the
land
against
overwhelming
numbers
of
saracens
lombards
and
other
intruders
and
the
life
of
those
old
monks
of
saint
basil
as
we
now
know
it
represented
a
veritable
renaissance
of
art
and
letters
of
the
ten
basilean
convents
that
grew
up
in
the
surroundings
of
rossano
the
most
celebrated
was
that
of
del
patir
together
with
the
others
it
succeeded
to
a
period
of
eremitism
of
solitary
anchorites
whose
dwellings
honeycombed
the
warm
slopes
that
confront
the
ionian
the
lives
of
some
of
these
hermits
are
valuable
documents
in
the
sanctorum
of
caietanus
the
student
will
find
a
latin
translation
of
the
biography
of
one
of
them
saint
elia
junior
he
died
in
it
was
written
by
a
contemporary
monk
who
tells
us
that
the
holy
man
performed
many
miracles
among
them
that
of
walking
over
a
river
dryshod
and
the
bollandists
acta
sanctorum
september
have
reprinted
the
biography
of
saint
elia
as
composed
in
greek
by
a
disciple
it
is
yet
more
interesting
he
lived
in
a
honesta
spelunca
which
he
discovered
in
by
means
of
a
flight
of
bats
issuing
therefrom
he
suffered
persecutions
from
a
woman
exactly
after
the
fashion
of
joseph
and
potiphar
wife
he
grew
to
be
years
old
the
saracens
vainly
tried
to
burn
his
dead
body
and
the
water
in
which
this
corpse
was
subsequently
washed
was
useful
for
curing
another
holy
man
toothache
yet
even
these
creatures
were
subject
to
gleams
of
common
sense
virtues
said
this
one
are
better
than
miracles
how
are
we
to
account
for
these
and
their
inelegant
habits
how
explain
this
poisoning
of
the
sources
of
manly
thus
i
think
that
under
the
influence
of
their
creed
they
reverted
perforce
to
the
more
bestial
traits
of
aboriginal
humanity
they
were
thrust
back
in
their
development
they
became
solitaries
animalesque
and
shy
such
as
we
may
imagine
our
hairy
progenitors
to
have
been
hence
their
dirt
and
vermin
their
horror
of
learning
their
unkempt
hair
their
ferocious
independence
their
distrust
of
sunshine
and
ordered
social
life
their
foul
dieting
their
dread
of
malign
spirits
their
propensities
all
bestial
characteristics
this
atavistic
movement
this
retrogression
towards
primevalism
must
have
possessed
a
certain
charm
for
it
attracted
vast
multitudes
it
was
only
hemmed
at
last
by
a
physical
obstacle
the
supply
of
caves
ran
out
not
till
then
were
its
votaries
forced
to
congregate
in
those
unhealthy
clusters
which
afterwards
grew
to
be
monasteries
where
many
of
them
were
gathered
together
under
one
roof
there
imposed
itself
a
certain
rudimentary
discipline
and
subordination
yet
they
preserved
as
much
as
they
could
of
their
savage
traits
cells
and
hatred
of
cleanliness
terror
of
demons
matted
beards
gradually
the
social
habits
of
mundane
insinuated
themselves
into
these
hives
of
squalor
and
idleness
the
inmates
began
to
wash
and
to
shave
they
acquired
property
they
tilled
the
ground
they
learnt
to
read
and
write
and
finally
became
connaisseurs
of
books
and
pictures
and
wine
and
women
they
were
pleased
to
forget
that
the
eunuch
and
the
beggar
are
the
true
christian
or
buddhist
in
other
words
the
allurements
of
rational
life
grew
too
strong
for
their
convictions
they
became
reasonable
beings
in
spite
of
their
creed
this
is
how
coenobitism
grew
out
of
eremitism
not
only
in
calabria
but
in
every
part
of
the
world
which
has
been
afflicted
with
these
eccentrics
go
to
mount
athos
if
you
wish
to
see
specimens
of
all
the
different
stages
conveniently
arranged
upon
a
small
area
this
convent
of
patir
exercised
a
great
local
influence
as
early
as
the
tenth
century
then
towards
the
end
of
the
eleventh
it
was
completely
rebuilt
without
and
reorganized
within
the
church
underwent
a
thorough
restoration
in
but
it
was
shattered
together
with
the
rest
of
the
edifice
by
the
earthquake
of
which
madonna
achiropita
notwithstanding
levelled
to
the
ground
of
the
fifteen
thousand
houses
then
standing
at
rossano
these
monastic
establishments
as
a
general
rule
were
occupied
later
on
by
the
benedictines
who
ousted
the
basileans
and
were
supplanted
in
their
turn
by
popular
orders
of
later
days
like
the
theatines
those
that
are
conveniently
situated
have
now
been
turned
into
post
offices
municipalities
and
other
public
buildings
such
has
been
the
common
procedure
but
many
of
them
like
this
of
patir
are
too
decayed
and
remote
from
the
life
of
man
fiore
who
wrote
in
counts
up
dilapidated
basilean
monasteries
in
calabria
out
of
a
former
total
of
about
two
hundred
patir
and
thirteen
others
he
mentions
as
having
in
his
day
their
old
rites
still
subsisting
batiffol
has
recently
gone
into
the
subject
with
his
usual
thoroughness
nothing
is
uglier
than
a
modern
ruin
and
the
place
would
assuredly
not
be
worth
the
three
hours
ride
from
rossano
were
it
not
for
the
church
which
has
been
repaired
and
for
the
wondrous
view
to
be
obtained
from
its
site
the
journey
too
is
charming
both
by
the
ordinary
track
that
descends
from
rossano
and
skirts
the
foot
of
the
hills
through
olives
and
pebbly
ascending
finally
across
an
odorous
tangle
of
cistus
rosemary
and
myrtle
to
the
platform
on
which
the
convent
stands
or
by
the
alternative
and
longer
route
which
i
took
on
the
homeward
way
and
which
follows
the
old
water
conduit
built
by
the
monks
into
a
forest
of
enormous
chestnuts
oaks
hollies
and
calabrian
pines
emerging
out
of
an
ocean
of
glittering
bracken
i
was
pursued
into
the
church
of
patir
by
a
bevy
of
country
wenches
who
frequented
this
region
for
purposes
of
haymaking
there
is
a
miraculous
crucifix
in
this
sanctuary
hidden
behind
a
veil
which
with
infinite
ceremony
these
females
withdrew
for
my
edification
there
it
was
sure
enough
but
what
i
wondered
would
happen
from
the
presence
of
these
impure
creatures
in
such
a
place
things
have
changed
considerably
since
the
days
of
old
for
such
was
the
contamination
to
be
expected
from
the
mere
presence
of
a
woman
within
these
walls
that
even
the
mother
of
god
while
visiting
saint
nilus
the
builder
not
the
great
saint
at
work
upon
the
foundations
often
conversed
with
him
but
never
ventured
to
step
within
the
area
of
the
building
itself
and
later
on
it
was
a
phenomenon
recorded
by
beltrano
and
others
that
if
a
female
entered
the
church
the
heavens
immediately
became
cloudy
and
sent
down
thunders
and
lightnings
and
signs
of
celestial
disapproval
which
never
ceased
until
the
offending
monster
had
left
the
premises
from
this
ancient
monastery
comes
i
fancy
the
achiropita
image
montorio
will
tell
you
all
about
it
he
learnt
its
history
in
june
from
the
local
archbishop
who
had
extracted
his
information
out
of
the
episcopal
archives
concerning
another
of
these
idols
that
of
del
patirion
you
may
read
in
the
ponderous
tomes
of
ughelli
whether
the
celebrated
purple
codex
of
rossano
ever
formed
part
of
the
library
of
patirion
has
not
yet
been
determined
this
wonderful
parchment
now
preserved
at
rossano
is
mentioned
for
the
first
time
by
cesare
malpica
who
wrote
some
interesting
things
about
the
albanian
and
greek
colonies
in
calabria
but
it
was
only
discovered
in
the
right
sense
of
that
word
in
march
by
gebhardt
and
harnack
they
illustrated
it
in
their
codex
haseloff
also
described
it
in
codex
purpureus
rossanensis
and
pointed
out
that
its
iconographical
value
consists
in
the
fact
that
it
is
the
only
greek
testament
containing
pictures
of
the
life
of
christ
before
the
century
these
pictures
are
indeed
marvellous
more
marvellous
than
beautiful
like
so
many
byzantine
productions
their
value
is
such
that
the
parchment
has
now
been
declared
a
national
monument
it
is
sternly
guarded
and
if
it
is
moved
out
of
rossano
as
happened
lately
when
it
was
exhibited
at
grottaferrata
it
travels
in
the
company
of
armed
carbineers
still
pursued
by
the
flock
of
women
i
took
to
examining
the
floor
of
this
church
which
contains
tesselated
marble
pavements
depicting
centaurs
unicorns
lions
stags
and
other
beasts
but
my
contemplation
of
these
choice
relics
was
disturbed
by
irrelevant
remarks
on
the
part
of
the
worldly
females
who
discovered
in
the
head
of
the
stag
some
subtle
peculiarity
that
stirred
their
sense
of
humour
look
said
one
of
them
to
her
neighbour
he
has
horns
just
like
your
pasquale
pasquale
indeed
and
how
about
antonio
i
enquired
whether
they
knew
what
kind
of
animals
these
were
beasts
of
the
ancients
beasts
that
nobody
knows
beasts
that
have
horns
like
certain
christians
from
the
terrace
of
green
sward
that
fronts
this
ruined
monastery
you
can
see
the
little
town
of
corigliano
whose
coquettish
white
houses
lie
in
a
fold
of
the
hills
corigliano
greek
xorion
land
of
olives
the
derivation
if
not
correct
is
at
least
appropriate
for
it
lies
embowered
in
a
forest
of
these
trees
a
gay
place
it
was
in
bourbon
times
with
a
ducal
ruler
of
its
own
here
they
say
the
remnants
of
the
sybarites
took
refuge
after
the
destruction
of
their
city
whose
desolate
plain
lies
at
our
feet
backed
by
the
noble
range
of
dolcedorme
swinburne
like
a
sensible
man
takes
the
sybarites
under
his
protection
he
defends
their
artificially
shaded
streets
and
those
other
signs
of
voluptuousness
which
to
judge
by
certain
modern
researches
seem
to
have
been
chiefly
contrived
for
combating
the
demon
of
malaria
earthly
welfare
the
cult
of
material
health
and
ease
such
was
ideal
in
sharpest
contrast
to
these
strivings
stands
the
aim
of
those
old
monks
who
scorned
the
body
as
a
mere
encumbrance
seeking
spiritual
enlightenment
and
things
not
of
this
earth
and
now
sybarites
and
basileans
alike
in
ruins
a
man
of
asked
which
of
the
two
civilizations
he
would
wish
restored
would
not
hesitate
long
in
deciding
for
the
hellenic
one
readers
of
lenormant
will
call
to
mind
his
glowing
pages
on
the
wonders
that
might
be
found
buried
on
the
site
of
sybaris
his
plan
of
excavation
sounds
feasible
enough
but
how
remote
it
becomes
when
one
remembers
the
case
of
herculaneum
here
to
our
certain
knowledge
many
miracles
of
antique
art
and
literature
lie
within
a
few
feet
of
our
reach
yet
nothing
is
done
these
hidden
monuments
which
are
the
heritage
of
all
humanity
are
withheld
from
our
eyes
by
the
policy
of
a
country
which
even
without
foreign
assistance
could
easily
accomplish
the
work
were
it
to
employ
thereon
only
half
the
sum
now
spent
in
feeding
clothing
and
supervising
a
horde
of
criminals
every
one
of
whom
ought
to
be
hanged
ten
times
over
meanwhile
other
nations
are
forbidden
to
the
german
proposals
were
scornfully
rejected
later
on
those
of
sir
charles
waldstein
what
says
the
d
are
we
to
have
international
thrust
upon
us
are
we
to
be
treated
like
the
turks
that
gentle
sirs
is
precisely
the
state
of
the
case
the
object
of
such
committees
is
to
do
for
the
good
of
mankind
what
a
single
nation
is
powerless
or
unwilling
to
do
your
behaviour
at
herculaneum
is
identical
with
that
of
the
turks
at
nineveh
the
system
adopted
should
likewise
be
the
same
i
shall
never
see
that
consummation
but
i
shall
not
forget
a
certain
article
in
an
american
paper
the
new
york
times
i
fancy
which
gave
me
fresh
food
for
thought
here
at
patirion
in
the
sight
of
that
old
hellenic
colony
and
with
the
light
chatter
of
those
women
still
ringing
in
my
ears
its
writer
with
whom
not
all
of
us
will
agree
declared
that
first
in
importance
of
all
the
antiquities
buried
in
italian
soil
come
the
lost
poems
of
sappho
the
lost
poems
of
sappho
a
singular
choice
in
corroboration
whereof
he
quoted
the
extravagant
praise
of
j
symonds
upon
that
amiable
and
ambiguous
young
person
and
he
might
have
added
algernon
swinburne
who
calls
her
the
greatest
poet
who
ever
was
at
all
sappho
and
these
two
victorians
i
said
to
myself
why
just
these
two
how
keen
is
the
cry
of
elective
affinity
athwart
the
ages
soul
says
plato
that
which
it
seeks
and
traces
obscurely
the
footsteps
of
its
obscure
the
footsteps
of
its
obscure
desire
so
one
stumbles
inadvertently
upon
problems
of
the
day
concerning
which
our
sages
profess
to
know
nothing
and
yet
i
do
perceive
a
certain
writing
upon
the
wall
setting
forth
in
clearest
language
that
a
legend
which
it
behoves
them
not
to
expunge
but
to
expound
for
it
refuses
to
be
expunged
and
we
do
not
need
a
german
lady
to
tell
us
how
much
the
synthetic
sex
the
hornless
but
not
brainless
sex
has
done
for
the
life
of
the
spirit
while
those
other
two
were
reclaiming
the
waste
places
of
earth
and
procreating
and
fighting
as
befits
their
horned
anatomy
xvi
reposing
at
castrovillari
i
remember
asking
my
friend
the
roman
deputy
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
and
whom
i
regard
as
a
fountain
of
wisdom
on
matters
italian
how
it
came
about
that
the
railway
stations
in
his
country
were
apt
to
be
so
far
distant
from
the
towns
they
serve
rocca
bernarda
i
was
saying
lies
kilometres
from
its
station
and
even
some
of
the
largest
towns
in
the
kingdom
are
inconveniently
and
unnecessarily
remote
from
the
line
true
he
replied
very
true
inconveniently
but
perhaps
not
unnecessarily
he
nodded
his
head
as
he
often
does
when
revolving
some
deep
problem
in
his
mind
well
sir
inasmuch
as
everything
has
its
reasons
be
they
geographical
sociological
or
otherwise
and
he
mused
again
let
me
tell
you
what
i
think
as
regards
our
respective
english
and
italian
points
of
view
he
said
at
last
and
to
begin
with
a
few
generalities
we
may
hold
that
success
in
modern
life
consists
in
correctly
appreciating
the
principles
which
underlie
our
experiences
in
what
may
be
called
the
scientific
attitude
towards
things
in
general
now
do
the
english
cultivate
this
attitude
not
sufficiently
they
are
in
the
stage
of
those
mediaeval
scholars
who
contentedly
alleged
separate
primary
causes
for
each
phenomenon
instead
of
seeking
by
the
investigation
of
secondary
ones
for
the
inevitable
interdependence
of
the
whole
in
other
words
they
do
not
subordinate
facts
they
them
your
politicians
and
all
your
public
men
are
guided
by
impulse
by
expediency
as
they
prefer
to
call
it
they
are
empirical
they
never
attempt
to
codify
their
conduct
they
despise
it
as
theorizing
what
happens
this
system
of
theirs
invariably
breaks
down
here
and
there
and
then
f
then
they
trust
to
some
divine
interposition
some
accident
to
put
things
to
rights
again
the
success
of
the
english
is
largely
built
up
on
such
accidents
on
the
mistakes
of
other
people
provi
dence
has
favoured
them
so
far
on
the
whole
but
one
day
it
may
leave
them
in
the
lurch
as
it
did
the
russians
in
their
war
with
the
japanese
one
day
other
people
will
forget
to
make
these
pleasant
mistakes
he
paused
and
i
forbore
to
interrupt
his
eloquence
to
come
now
to
the
practical
application
to
this
particular
instance
tell
me
does
your
english
system
testify
to
any
constructive
forethought
in
london
i
am
assured
the
railway
companies
have
built
stations
at
enormous
expense
in
the
very
heart
of
the
town
what
will
be
the
consequence
of
this
policy
this
that
in
fifty
years
such
structures
will
have
become
obsolete
stranded
in
slums
at
the
back
of
new
quarters
yet
undreamed
of
new
depots
will
have
to
be
built
whereas
in
italy
the
now
distant
city
will
in
fifty
years
have
grown
to
reach
its
station
and
in
another
will
have
encircled
it
thanks
to
our
sagacity
the
station
will
then
be
in
its
proper
place
in
the
centre
of
the
town
our
progeny
will
be
grateful
and
that
again
you
will
admit
is
a
worthy
aim
for
our
politicians
besides
what
would
happen
to
our
coachmen
if
nobody
needed
their
services
on
arriving
at
his
destination
the
poor
men
must
not
be
allowed
to
starve
cold
head
and
warm
heart
you
know
humanitarian
considerations
can
not
be
thrust
aside
by
a
community
that
prides
itself
on
being
truly
civilized
i
trust
i
have
made
myself
intelligible
you
always
do
but
why
should
i
incommode
myself
to
please
your
progeny
or
even
my
own
and
i
do
like
the
kind
of
warm
heart
that
subordinates
my
concerns
to
those
of
a
you
do
altogether
convince
me
dear
sir
to
speak
frankly
i
sometimes
do
convince
myself
my
own
country
station
for
example
is
curiously
remote
from
the
city
and
it
is
annoying
on
wintry
nights
to
drive
through
six
miles
of
level
mud
when
you
are
anxious
to
reach
home
and
dinner
so
much
so
that
in
my
egoistical
moments
i
would
have
been
glad
if
our
administration
had
adopted
the
more
specious
british
method
but
come
now
you
can
not
raise
that
objection
against
the
terminus
at
rome
not
that
one
but
i
can
raise
two
others
the
platforms
are
inconveniently
arranged
and
a
traveller
will
often
find
it
impossible
to
wash
his
hands
and
face
there
as

granting
a
certain
deplorable
disposition
of
the
lines
why
on
earth
pray
should
a
man
cleanse
himself
at
the
station
when
there
are
countless
hotels
and
in
the
city
o

originals
and
supposing
i

i
have
you
my
illustrious
friend
travels

of
rome
nobody
travels
south
of
rome
often
have
i
thought
upon
those
words
this
conversation
was
forcibly
recalled
to
my
mind
by
the
fact
that
it
took
our
creaky
old
diligence
two
and
a
half
hours
one
of
the
horses
had
been
bought
the
day
before
for
six
pounds
to
drive
from
the
station
of
castrovillari
to
the
entrance
of
the
town
where
we
were
delayed
another
twenty
minutes
while
the
octroi
zealots
searched
through
every
bag
and
parcel
on
the
many
people
have
said
bad
things
about
this
place
but
my
once
unpleasant
impressions
of
it
have
been
effaced
by
my
reception
at
its
new
and
decent
little
hostelry
what
a
change
after
the
sordid
filth
of
rossano
castrovillari
to
be
sure
has
no
background
of
hoary
eld
to
atone
for
such
deficiencies
it
was
only
built
the
other
day
by
the
normans
or
by
the
romans
who
called
it
aprustum
or
possibly
by
the
greeks
who
founded
their
abystron
on
this
particular
site
for
the
same
reasons
that
commended
it
in
yet
earlier
times
to
certain
bronze
and
stone
age
primitives
whose
weapons
you
may
study
in
the
british
museum
and
elsewhere

even
so
taranto
cumae
paestum
metapontum
monteleone
and
other
southern
towns
were
founded
by
the
ancients
on
the
site
of
prehistoric
stations
but
what
are
the
stone
ages
compared
with
immortal
and
immutable
rossano
an
ecclesiastical
writer
has
proved
that
calabria
was
inhabited
before
the
noachian
flood
and
rossano
we
may
be
sure
was
one
of
the
favourite
haunts
of
the
antediluvians
none
the
less
it
is
good
to
rest
in
a
clean
bed
for
a
change
and
to
feed
off
a
clean
plate
we
are
in
the
south
one
sees
it
in
sundry
small
ways
in
the
behaviour
of
the
cats
for
instance
the
tarentines
they
say
imported
the
cat
into
europe
if
those
of
south
italy
still
resemble
their
old
nubian
ancestors
the
beast
would
assuredly
not
have
been
worth
the
trouble
of
acclimatizing
on
entering
these
regions
one
of
the
first
things
that
strikes
me
is
the
difference
between
the
appearance
of
cats
and
dogs
hereabouts
and
in
england
or
any
northern
country
and
the
difference
in
their
temperaments
our
dogs
are
alert
in
their
movements
and
of
wideawake
features
here
they
are
arowsy
and
degraded
mongrels
with
expressionless
eyes
our
cats
are
sleek
and
slumberous
here
they
prowl
about
haggard
shifty
and
careworn
their
fur
in
patches
and
their
ears
from
nervous
anxiety
that
domestic
animals
such
as
these
should
be
fed
at
home
does
not
commend
itself
to
the
common
people
they
must
forage
for
their
food
abroad
dogs
eat
offal
while
the
others
hunt
for
lizards
in
the
fields
a
lizard
diet
is
supposed
to
reduce
their
weight
it
would
certainly
reduce
mine
but
i
suspect
that
southern
cats
are
emaciated
not
only
from
this
cause
but
from
systematic
starvation
many
a
kitten
is
born
that
never
tastes
a
drop
of
cow
milk
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
and
little
enough
of
its
own
mother
to
say
that
our
english
cult
of
smacks
of
degeneracy
does
not
mean
that
i
sympathize
with
the
of
beasts
which
annoys
many
visitors
to
these
parts
and
has
been
attributed
to
saracenic
influences
wrongly
of
course
one
might
as
well
attribute
it
to
the
old
greeks
footnote
whose
attitude
towards
animals
by
the
way
was
as
far
removed
from
callousness
as
from
sentimentalism
we
know
how
those
hellenic
oxen
fared
who
had
laboured
to
draw
up
heavy
blocks
for
the
building
of
a
temple
how
on
the
completion
of
their
task
they
were
led
into
green
fields
there
to
pasture
unmolested
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
we
know
that
the
greeks
were
appreciative
of
the
graces
and
virtues
of
canine
nature
is
not
the
homeric
argo
still
the
finest
in
literature
yet
to
them
the
dog
even
he
of
the
tender
anthology
remained
what
he
is
a
tamed
beast
the
greeks
sitting
at
dinner
resented
the
insolence
of
a
creature
that
watching
every
morsel
as
it
disappeared
into
the
mouth
of
its
master
plainly
discovered
by
its
physiognomy
the
desire
the
presumed
right
to
devour
what
he
considered
fit
only
for
himself
whence
that
profound
word
greek
kunopes
shameless
in
contrast
to
this
sanity
observe
what
an
englishman
can
read
into
a
dog
eye
that
liquid
melancholy
eye
from
whose
pathetic
springs
seemed
surging
the
virgilian
cry
the
sense
of
tears
in
mortal
things
that
is
how
matthew
arnold
interprets
the
feelings
of
fido
watching
his
master
at
work
upon
a
tender
beefsteak
poor
saracens
they
are
a
sort
of
all
over
the
country
the
chief
sinner
in
this
respect
is
the
vatican
which
has
authorized
cruelty
to
animals
by
its
official
teaching
when
lord
enquired
of
the
pope
regarding
the
foundation
of
a
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
in
italy
the
papal
answer
was
such
an
association
not
be
by
the
holy
see
being
founded
on
a
theological
error
to
wit
that
christians
owed
any
duties
to
animals
this
language
has
the
inestimable
and
rather
unusual
merit
of
being
perspicuous
nevertheless
ouida
flaming
letters

the
times
inaugurated

era
of
truer
humanity
and
the
lateness

i
sat
down

engineers
and
so
forth
were
still
dropping
in
for
their
evening
meal
appetite
comes
more
slowly
than
ever
now
that
the
heats
have
begun
they
have
begun
in
earnest
the
swoon
of
summer
is
upon
the
land
the
grass
is
cut
cicadas
are
chirping
overhead
despite
its
height
of
a
thousand
feet
castrovillari
must
be
blazing
in
august
surrounded
as
it
is
by
parched
fields
and
an
amphitheatre
of
bare
limestone
hills
that
exhale
the
sunny
beams
you
may
stroll
about
these
fields
observing
the
construction
of
the
line
which
is
to
pass
through
cassano
a
pretty
place
famous
for
its
wine
and
mineral
springs
or
studying
the
habits
of
the
gigantic
grasshoppers
that
hang
in
clusters
to
the
dried
thistles
and
start
off
when
scared
with
the
noise
of
a
covey
of
partridges
or
watching
how
the
cows
are
shod
at
this
season
to
thresh
the
corn
old
authors
are
unanimous
in
declaring
that
the
town
was
embowered
in
oak
forests
as
late
as
it
was
lamented
that
this
ancient
barbarous
custom
of
cutting
them
down
had
not
yet
been
discontinued
the
mischief
is
now
done
and
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
the
difference
between
the
present
summer
temperature
and
that
of
olden
days
the
manna
ash
used
to
be
cultivated
in
these
parts
i
can
not
tell
whether
its
purgative
secretion
is
still
in
favour
the
confusion
between
this
stuff
and
the
biblical
manna
gave
rise
to
the
legends
about
calabria
where
manna
droppeth
as
dew
from
heaven
sandys
says
it
was
prepared
out
of
the
mulberry
he
copied
assiduously
did
old
sandys
and
yet
found
room
for
some
original
blunders
of
his
own
pococke
by
the
way
is
one
of
those
who
were
dissatisfied
with
castrovillari
he
found
no
accommodation
save
an
empty
house
a
poor
town
driving
through
modern
castrovillari
one
might
think
the
place
flat
and
undeserving
of
the
name
of
but
the
old
town
is
otherwise
it
occupies
a
proud
eminence
the
head
of
a
promontory
which
overlooks
the
junction
of
two
streams
the
newer
settlement
stands
on
the
more
level
ground
at
its
back
this
acropolis
once
thronged
with
folk
but
now
deserted
has
all
the
macabre
fascination
of
decay
a
mildewy
spirit
haunts
those
tortuous
and
uneven
roadways
plaster
drops
unheeded
from
the
walls
the
wild
fig
thrusts
luxuriant
arms
through
the
windows
of
palaces
whose
balconies
are
rusted
and
painted
loggias
crumbling
to
earth
a
mournful
and
malarious
agglomeration
of
ruins
there
is
a
castle
of
course
it
was
built
or
rebuilt
by
the
aragonese
with
four
corner
towers
one
of
which
became
infamous
for
a
scene
that
rivals
the
horrors
of
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
numbers
of
confined
brigands
perished
miserably
of
starvation
within
its
walls
says
the
historian
botta
the
abominable
taint
prevented
the
guards
from
approaching
the
dead
bodies
were
not
carried
away
the
pestilence
increased
in
pain
and
exhaustion
the
dying
fell
shuddering
on
the
dead
the
hale
on
the
dying
all
tearing
themselves
like
dogs
with
teeth
and
nails
the
tower
of
castrovillari
became
a
foul
hole
of
corruption
and
the
stench
was
spread
abroad
for
a
long
season
this
castle
is
now
used
as
a
place
of
confinement
sentries
warned
me
at
one
point
not
to
approach
too
near
the
walls
it
was
forbidden
i
had
no
particular
desire
to
disobey
this
injunction
judging
by
the
number
of
rats
that
swarm
about
the
place
it
is
not
exactly
a
model
prison
one
of
the
streets
in
this
dilapidated
stronghold
bears
to
this
day
the
inscription
giudea
or
jewry
southern
italy
was
well
stocked
with
those
hebrews
concerning
whom
adler
has
sagely
discoursed
they
lived
in
separate
districts
and
seem
to
have
borne
a
good
reputation
those
of
castrovillari
on
being
ejected
by
ferdinand
the
catholic
in
obligingly
made
a
donation
of
their
school
to
the
town
but
they
returned
anon
and
claimed
it
again
persecuted
as
they
were
they
never
suffered
the
martyrdom
of
the
waldensian
colonies
in
calabria
the
houses
of
this
jewry
overlook
the
coscile
river
the
sybaris
of
old
and
from
a
spot
in
the
quarter
a
steep
path
descends
to
its
banks
here
you
will
find
yourself
in
another
climate
cool
and
moist
the
livid
waters
tumble
gleefully
towards
the
plain
amid
penurious
plots
of
beans
and
tomatoes
and
a
fierce
tangle
of
vegetation
wherever
the
hand
of
man
has
not
made
clearings
then
mounting
aloft
once
more
you
will
do
well
to
visit
the
chapel
that
sits
at
the
apex
of
the
promontory
santa
maria
del
castello
there
is
a
little
platform
where
you
may
repose
and
enjoy
the
view
as
i
have
done
for
some
evenings
past
letting
the
eye
roam
towards
dolcedorme
and
its
sister
peaks
and
westwards
over
the
undulating
sila
lands
whose
highest
point
botte
donato
is
unmistakable
even
at
this
distance
of
forty
miles
from
its
peculiar
shape
the
madonna
picture
preserved
within
the
sanctuary
has
performed
so
many
miracles
in
ages
past
that
i
despair
of
giving
any
account
of
them
it
is
high
time
none
the
less
for
a
new
sign
from
heaven
shattered
by
earthquakes
the
chapel
is
in
a
and
even
menacing
condition
will
some
returned
emigrant
from
america
come
forward
with
the
necessary
funds
that
would
be
a
miracle
too
in
its
way
but
gone
for
the
present
are
the
ages
of
faith
the
days
when
the
bartels
sojourned
here
and
groaned
as
he
counted
up
the
seven
monasteries
of
castrovillari
there
used
to
be
nearly
twice
that
number
and
viewed
the
priests
rascals
loafing
about
the
streets
and
doorways
from
my
window
in
the
hotel
i
espy
a
small
patch
of
snow
on
the
hills
i
know
the
place
it
is
the
montagna
del
principe
past
which
the
track
winds
into
the
pollino
regions
thither
i
am
bound
but
so
complicated
is
life
that
even
for
a
short
three
days
ramble
among
those
forests
a
certain
amount
of
food
and
clothing
must
be
provided
a
mule
is
plainly
required
there
seem
to
be
none
of
these
beasts
available
at
castrovillari
to
morano
they
tell
me
it
is
nearer
the
mountain
and
there
you
will
find
mules
plentiful
as
blackberries
to
morano
morano
lies
a
few
miles
higher
up
the
valley
on
the
great
military
road
to
lagonegro
which
was
built
by
murat
and
cuts
through
the
interior
of
basilicata
rising
at
campo
tenese
to
a
height
of
noo
metres
they
are
now
running
a
public
motor
service
along
this
beautiful
stretch
of
kilometres
at
the
cheap
rate
of
a
sou
per
kilometre
route
another
symptom
of
the
south
once
you
have
reached
the
latitude
of
naples
the
word
thank
you
vanishes
from
the
vocabulary
of
all
save
the
most
cultured
but
to
conclude
therefrom
that
one
is
among
a
thankless
race
is
not
altogether
the
right
inference
they
have
a
wholly
different
conception
of
the
affair
our
septentrional
thanks
is
a
complicated
product
in
which
gratefulness
for
things
received
and
for
things
to
come
are
unconsciously
balanced
while
their
point
of
view
differs
in
nothing
from
that
of
the
of
greek
courtesy
of
achilles
whose
mother
procured
for
him
a
suit
of
divine
armour
from
hephaistos
which
he
received
without
a
word
of
acknowledgment
either
for
her
or
for
the
god
who
had
been
put
to
some
little
trouble
in
the
matter
a
thing
given
they
regard
as
a
thing
found
a
hermaion
a
happy
hit
in
the
lottery
of
life
the
giver
is
the
blind
instrument
of
fortune
this
chill
attitude
repels
us
and
our
effusive
expressions
of
thankfulness
astonish
these
people
and
the
orientals
a
further
difference
is
that
the
actual
gift
is
viewed
quite
extrinsically
intellectually
either
in
regard
to
what
it
would
fetch
if
bartered
or
sold
or
if
to
be
kept
as
to
how
far
its
possession
may
raise
the
recipient
in
the
eyes
of
other
men
this
is
purely
homeric
once
more
homeric
or
primordial
if
you
prefer
odysseus
told
his
kind
host
alkinoos
whom
he
was
never
to
see
again
that
he
would
be
glad
to
receive
farewell
presents
from
him
to
cherish
as
a
friendly
memory
no
but
because
they
would
make
him
look
a
finer
fellow
when
he
got
home
the
idea
of
a
keepsake
of
an
emotional
value
attaching
to
some
trifle
is
a
northern
one
here
life
is
give
and
take
and
lucky
he
who
takes
more
than
he
gives
it
is
what
professor
mahaffy
calls
the
ingrained
selfishness
of
the
greek
character
speaking
of
all
below
the
upper
classes
i
should
say
that
disinterested
benevolence
is
apt
to
surpass
their
comprehension
a
person
being
regarded
as
weak
in
the
head
has
this
man
then
no
family
that
he
should
benefit
strangers
or
is
he
one
of
nature
unfortunates
thus
they
argue
they
will
do
acts
of
spontaneous
kindness
towards
their
family
far
oftener
than
is
customary
with
us
but
outside
that
narrow
sphere
odyssean
is
the
mainspring
of
their
actions
whence
their
smooth
and
glozing
manners
towards
the
stranger
and
those
protestations
of
undying
affection
which
beguile
the
unwary
they
wish
to
be
forever
in
your
good
graces
for
sooner
or
later
you
may
be
of
use
and
if
perchance
you
do
content
them
they
will
marvel
philosophically
at
your
grotesque
generosity
your
lack
of
discrimination
and
restraint
such
cleverness
is
none
the
more
respectable
for
being
childishly
transparent
the
profound
and
unscrupulous
northerner
quickly
familiarizes
himself
with
its
technique
and
turns
it
to
his
own
profit
lowering
his
moral
notions
he
soon
so
one
of
them
expressed
it
to
me
walks
round
them
without
getting
off
his
chair
and
on
the
strength
of
his
undeserved
reputation
for
simplicity
and
fair
dealing
keeps
them
dangling
a
lifetime
in
a
tremble
of
obsequious
amiability
cheered
on
by
the
hope
of
ultimately
him
idle
dream
where
a
pliant
and
sanguine
southerner
is
pitted
against
the
unswerving
saxon
or
teuton
this
accounts
for
the
success
of
foreign
trading
houses
in
the
south
business
is
business
and
the
devil
take
the
hindmost
by
all
means
but
they
who
are
not
rooted
to
the
spot
by
commercial
exigencies
nor
ready
to
adopt
debased
standards
of
conduct
will
find
that
a
prolonged
residence
in
a
centre
like
naples
the
daily
attrition
of
its
elements
sullies
their
homely
candour
and
for
a
tigerish
flavour
does
exist
in
most
of
these
southern
towns
camorra
the
law
of
intimidation
rules
the
city
this
is
what
stendhal
meant
when
speaking
of
the
simple
and
inoffensive
personages
in
the
vicar
of
wakefield
he
remarked
that
in
the
sombre
italy
a
simple
and
inoffensive
creature
would
be
quickly
destroyed
it
is
not
easy
to
be
inoffensive
and
yet
respected
in
a
land
of
teeth
and
claws
where
a
man
is
reverenced
in
proportion
as
he
can
browbeat
his
fellows
so
much
ferocity
tinctures
civic
life
that
had
they
not
dwelt
in
towns
while
we
were
still
shivering
in
bogs
one
would
deem
them
not
yet
ripe
for
herding
together
in
large
numbers
one
would
say
that
conditions
evoked
the
worst
qualities
of
the
race
and
we
must
revise
our
conceptions
of
fat
and
lean
men
we
must
pity
cassius
and
dread
falstaff
what
has
happened
you
ask
some
enormous
individual
to
your

to
which
one
of
them
oh
signor

the

i
have
eaten
him
beware
of
the
fat
neapolitan
he
is
fat
from
prosperity
from
dining
off
his
leaner
brothers
which
reminds
me
of
a
supremely
important
subject
eating
the
feeding
here
is
saner
than
ours
with
its
animal
grease
even
a
boiled
egg
tastes
of
mutton
fat
in

its
suet
and
those
other
inventions
of
the
devil
whose
awful
effects
we
only
survive
because
we
are
continually
counteracting
or
eliminating
them
by
the
help
of
pills
athletics
and
alcohol
saner
as
regards
material
but
hopelessly
irrational
in
method
your
ordinary
employe
begins
his
day
with
a
thimbleful
of
black
coffee
nothing
more
what
work
shall
be
got
out
of
him
under
such
conditions
of
course
it
takes
ten
men
to
do
the
work
of
one
and
of
course
all
ten
of
them
are
sulky
and
irritable
throughout
the
morning
thinking
only
of
their
luncheon
then
indeed
then
they
make
up
for
lost
time
those
few
favoured
ones
at
least
who
can
afford
it
i
once
watched
a
young
fellow
a
clerk
of
some
kind
in
a
restaurant
at
midday
he
began
by
informing
the
waiter
that
he
had
no
appetite
that
morning
di
dio
no
appetite
whatever
but
at
last
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
into
consuming
a
d
of
anchovies
and
olives
then
he
was
induced
to
try
the
maccheroni
because
they
were
particularly
good
that
morning
he
ate
or
rather
drank
an
immense
plateful
after
that
came
some
slices
of
meat
and
a
dish
of
green
stuff
sufficient
to
satisfy
a
starving
bullock
a
little
fish
asked
the
waiter
well
perhaps
yes
just
for
form
sake
two
fried
mullets
and
some
nondescript
fragments
next
he
devoured
a
couple
of
raw
eggs
on
account
of
his
miserably
weak
stomach
a
bowl
of
salad
and
a
goodly
lump
of
fresh
cheese
not
without
a
secret
feeling
of
envy
i
left
him
at
work
upon
his
dessert
of
which
he
had
already
consumed
some
six
peaches
add
to
this
quite
an
ordinary
repast
half
a
bottle
of
heavy
wine
a
cup
of
black
coffee
and
three
glasses
of
water
what
work
shall
be
got
out
of
a
man
after
such
a
collation
he
is
as
exasperated
and
prone
to
take
offence
as
in
the
morning
this
time
from
another
cause
that
is
why
so
many
of
them
suffer
from
chronic
troubles
of
the
digestive
organs
the
head
of
a
hospital
at
naples
tells
me
that
stomach
diseases
are
more
prevalent
there
than
in
any
other
part
of
europe
and
the
stomach
whatever
sentimentalists
may
say
to
the
contrary
being
the
true
seat
of
the
emotions
it
follows
that
a
judicious
system
of
dieting
might
work
wonders
upon
their
development
nearly
all
mediterranean
races
have
been
misfed
from
early
days
that
is
why
they
are
so
small
i
would
undertake
to
raise
the
italian
standard
of
height
by
several
inches
if
i
had
control
of
their
nutrition
for
a
few
centuries
i
would
undertake
to
alter
their
whole
outlook
upon
life
to
convert
them
from
utilitarians
into
romantics
were
such
a
change
desirable
for
if
utilitarianism
be
the
shadow
of
starvation
romance
is
nothing
but
the
vapour
of
repletion
and
yet
men
still
talk
of
as
of
something
fixed
and
immutable
the
jews
so
long
as
they
starved
in
palestine
were
the
most
acrimonious
bigots
on
earth
now
that
they
live
and
feed
sensibly
they
have
learnt
to
see
things
in
their
true
perspective
they
have
become
rationalists
their
less
fortunate
the
arabs
have
continued
to
starve
and
to
swear
by
the
koran
empty
in
body
and
empty
in
mind
no
poise
or
balance
is
possible
to
those
who
live
in
uneasy
conditions
the
wisest
of
them
can
only
attain
to
stoicism
a
dumb
protest
against
the
environment
there
are
no
stoics
among
people
the
romans
made
that
discovery
for
themselves
when
they
abandoned
the
habits
of
the
republic
in
short
it
seems
to
me
that
virtues
and
vices
which
can
not
be
expressed
in
physiological
terms
are
not
worth
talking
about
that
when
a
morality
refuses
to
derive
its
sanction
from
the
laws
which
govern
our
body
it
loses
the
right
to
exist
this
being
so
what
is
the
most
conspicuous
native
vice
envy
without
a
doubt
out
of
envy
they
pine
away
and
die
out
of
envy
they
kill
one
another
to
produce
a
more
placid
race
footnote
by
placid
i
do
not
mean
and
pitiful
in
the
christian
sense
that
doctrine
of
loving
and
forgiving
one
enemies
is
based
on
sheer
funk
our
pity
for
others
is
dangerously
akin
to
most
odious
of
vices
catholic
teaching
in
practice
if
not
in
theory
artfully
over
the
desirability
of
these
imported
knowing
that
they
can
not
appeal
to
a
masculine
stock
by
placid
i
mean
steady
to
dilute
envious
thoughts
and
the
acts
to
which
they
lead
is
at
bottom
a
question
of
nutrition
one
would
like
to
know
for
how
much
black
brooding
and
for
how
many
revengeful
deeds
that
morning
thimbleful
of
black
coffee
is
responsible
the
very
faces
one
sees
in
the
streets
would
change
envy
is
reflected
in
all
too
many
of
those
of
the
middle
classes
while
the
poorest
citizens
are
often
haggard
and
distraught
from
sheer
hunger
hunger
which
has
not
had
time
to
be
commuted
into
moral
poison
men
in
responsible
positions
being
forced
to
live
on
salaries
which
a
london
would
disdain
when
that
other
local
feature
that
respect
for
honourable
poverty
the
reverse
of
what
we
see
in
england
where
since
the
days
of
the
pope
a
slender
income
has
grown
to
be
considered
a
subject
of
reproach
and
yet
another
symptom
of
the
south
enough
the
clock
points
to
it
is
time
for
an
evening
walk
my
final
one
to
the
terrace
of
del
castello
xvii
old
morano
this
morano
is
a
very
ancient
city
tufarelli
writing
in
proves
that
it
was
then
exactly
years
old
oddly
enough
therefore
its
foundation
almost
coincides
with
that
of
rossano
there
may
be
mules
at
morano
indeed
there
are
but
they
are
illusive
beasts
despite
the
assistance
of
the
captain
of
the
carbineers
the
local
innkeeper
the
communal
policeman
the
secretary
of
the
municipality
an
amiable
canon
of
the
church
and
several
residents
i
vainly
endeavoured
for
three
days
to
procure
one
flitting
about
meanwhile
between
this
place
and
castrovillari
for
morano
notwithstanding
its
size
they
say
it
is
larger
than
the
other
town
offers
no
accommodation
or
food
in
the
septentrional
sense
of
those
terms
its
situation
as
you
approach
from
castrovillari
is
striking
the
white
houses
stream
in
a
cataract
down
one
side
of
a
steep
conical
hill
that
dominates
the
landscape
on
the
summit
sits
the
inevitable
castle
blue
sky
peering
through
its
battered
windows
but
the
interior
is
not
at
all
in
keeping
with
this
imposing
aspect
morano
so
far
as
i
was
able
to
explore
it
is
a
labyrinth
of
sombre
tortuous
and
fetid
alleys
whexe
black
pigs
wallow
amid
heaps
miscellaneous
and
malodorous
filth
in
short
the
town
exemplifies
that
particular
idea
of
civic
liberty
which
consists
in
everybody
being
free
to
throw
their
own
private
refuse
into
the
public
street
and
leave
it
there
from
generation
to
generation
what
says
lombroso
the
is
entrusted
in
many
towns
to
the
rains
of
heaven
and
in
their
absence
to
the
voracity
of
the
pigs
none
the
less
while
waiting
for
mules
that
never
came
i
took
to
patrolling
those
alleys
at
first
out
of
sheer
boredom
but
soon
impelled
by
that
subtle
fascination
which
emanates
from
the
plus
of
anything
even
of
grotesque
dirtiness
on
the
second
day
however
a
case
of
cholera
was
announced
which
chilled
my
ardour
for
further
investigations
it
was
on
that
account
that
i
failed
to
inspect
what
was
afterwards
described
to
me
as
the
chief
marvel
of
the
place
a
carved
wooden
in
a
certain
church
it
is
prodigious
and
said
an
obliging
citizen
to
whom
i
applied
for
information
there
is
nothing
like
it
on
earth
and
i
have
been
six
times
to
america
sir
the
artist
a
real
artist
mind
you
not
a
common
professor
spent
his
whole
life
in
carving
it
it
was
for
the
church
you
see
and
he
wanted
to
show
what
he
could
do
in
the
way
of
a
masterpiece
then
when
it
was
finished
and
in
its
place
the
priests
refused
to
pay
for
it
it
was
made
not
for
them
they
said
but
for
the
glory
of
god
the
man
reward
was
sufficient
and
besides
he
could
have
remission
of
sins
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
said
he
did
not
care
about
remission
of
sins
he
wanted
money
money
but
he
got
nothing
whereupon
he
began
to
brood
and
to
grow
yellow
money
money
that
was
all
he
ever
said
and
at
last
he
became
quite
green
and
died
after
that
his
son
took
up
the
quarrel
but
he
got
as
little
out
of
the
priests
as
the
father
it
was
fixed
in
the
church
you
understand
and
he
could
not
take
it
away
he
climbed
through
the
window
one
night
and
tried
to
burn
it
the
marks
are
there
to
this
day
but
they
were
too
sharp
for
him
and
he
took
the
business
so
much
to
heart
that
he
also
soon
died
quite
young
and
quite
green
like
his
father
the
most
characteristic
item
in
the
above
history
is
that
about
growing
green
people
are
apt
to
put
on
this
colour
in
the
south
from
disappointment
or
from
envy
they
have
a
proverb
which
runs
sfoga
o
schiatta
relieve
yourself
or
burst
our
vaunted
ideal
of
of
dominating
the
reflexes
being
thought
not
only
fanciful
but
injurious
to
health
therefore
if
relief
is
thwarted
they
either
brood
themselves
into
a
green
melancholy
or
succumb
to
a
sudden
colpo
di
sangue
like
a
young
woman
of
my
acquaintance
who
considering
herself
beaten
in
a
dispute
with
a
about
a
penny
forthwith
had
a
colpo
di
sangue
and
was
dead
in
a
few
hours
a
primeval
assertion
of
the
ego
unable
to
perambulate
the
streets
of
morano
i
climbed
to
the
ruined
fortress
along
the
verdant
slope
at
its
back
and
enjoyed
a
fair
view
down
the
fertile
valley
irrigated
by
streamlets
and
planted
with
patches
of
culture
with
mulberries
pomegranates
and
poplars
some
boys
were
up
here
engaged
in
fishing
fishing
for
young
kestrels
in
their
nest
above
a
shattered
gateway
the
tackle
consisted
of
a
rod
with
a
bent
piece
of
wire
fixed
to
one
end
and
it
seemed
to
me
a
pretty
unpromising
form
of
sport
but
suddenly
amid
wild
vociferations
they
hooked
one
and
carried
it
off
in
triumph
to
supper
the
mother
bird
meanwhile
sailed
restlessly
about
the
aether
watching
every
movement
as
i
could
see
by
my
glasses
at
times
she
drifted
quite
near
then
swerved
again
and
hovered
with
vibrating
pinions
directly
overhead
it
was
clear
that
she
could
not
tear
herself
away
from
the
scene
and
hardly
had
the
marauders
departed
when
she
alighted
on
the
wall
and
began
to
inspect
what
was
left
of
her
dwelling
it
was
probably
rather
untidy
i
felt
sorry
for
her
yet
such
harebrained
imprudence
can
not
go
unpunished
with
so
many
hundred
crannies
in
this
old
castle
why
choose
one
which
any
boy
can
reach
with
a
stick
she
will
know
better
next
season
then
an
old
shepherd
scrambled
up
and
sat
on
the
stone
beside
me
he
was
asthmatic
and
unable
to
work
the
doctor
had
recommended
an
evening
walk
up
to
the
castle
we
conversed
awhile
and
he
extracted
a
carnation
out
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
unusual
receptacle
for
flowers
which
he
presented
to
me
i
touched
upon
the
topic
of
mules
mules
are
very
busy
animals
in
morano
he
explained
animali
occupatissimi
however
he
promised
to
exert
himself
on
my
behalf
he
knew
a
man
with
a
mule
two
mules
he
would
send
him
round
if
possible
quite
a
feature
in
the
landscape
of
morano
is
the
costume
of
the
women
with
their
red
skirts
and
ribbons
of
the
same
hue
plaited
into
their
hair
it
is
a
beautiful
and
reposeful
shade
of
red
between
pompeian
and
and
the
tint
very
closely
resembles
that
of
the
cloth
worn
by
the
beduin
married
women
of
tunisia
maybe
it
was
introduced
by
the
saracens
and
it
is
they
i
imagine
who
imported
that
love
of
red
peppers
a
favourite
dish
with
most
orientals
which
is
peculiar
to
these
parts
where
they
eat
them
voraciously
in
every
form
particularly
in
that
of
red
sausages
seasoned
with
these
fiery
condiments
the
whole
country
is
full
of
saracen
memories
the
name
of
morano
they
say
is
derived
from
footnote
this
is
all
wrong
of
course
and
equally
wrong
is
the
derivation
from
a
mulberry
abundant
as
these
trees
are
and
more
wrong
still
if
possible
is
that
which
is
drawn
from
a
saying
of
the
mysterious
oenotrians
that
useful
tribe
who
wandering
in
search
of
homesteads
across
these
regions
and
observing
their
beauty
are
supposed
to
have
remarked
moremur
here
let
us
stay
morano
strange
to
say
is
simply
the
roman
muranum
a
moor
and
in
its
little
piazza
an
irregular
and
picturesque
spot
shaded
by
a
few
grand
old
elms
amid
the
sound
of
running
waters
there
is
a
sculptured
head
of
a
moor
inserted
into
the
wall
commemorative
i
was
told
of
some
ancient
exploit
it
is
the
escutcheon
of
the
town
this
moor
wears
a
red
fez
and
his
features
are
painted
black
this
is
rigueur
for
saracens
he
bears
the
legend
sub
arbore
near
at
hand
too
lies
the
prosperous
village
saracena
celebrated
of
old
for
its
muscatel
wines
they
are
made
from
the
grape
which
the
saracens
brought
over
from
maskat
and
planted
all
over
sicily

the

must
take
up

an

a

bordering
on

but
perhaps
we
are
too
easily
influenced
by
externals
in
these
degenerate
times
or
things
may
have
been
better
in
days
of
old
who
can
tell
one
always
likes
to
think
so
though
the
evidence
usually
points
to
the
contrary
when
least
i
expected
it
a
possessor
of
mules
presented
himself
he
was
a
burly
ruffian
of
northern
extraction
with
clear
eyes
fair
moustache
and
an
insidious
air
of
cheerfulness
yes
he
had
a
mule
he
said
but
as
to
climbing
the
mountain
for
three
or
four
days
on
end
ha
ha
that
was
rather
an
undertaking
you
know
was
i
aware
that
there
were
forests
and
snow
up
there
had
i
ever
been
up
the
mountain
indeed
well
then
i
must
know
that
there
was
no
food
i
pointed
to
my
store
of
provisions
from
castrovillari
his
eye
wandered
lovingly
over
the
pile
and
reposed
finally
upon
sundry
odd
bottles
and
a
capacious
demijohn
holding
twelve
litres
wine
of
family
i
urged
none
of
your
stuff
he
thought
he
could
manage
it
after
all
yes
the
trip
could
be
undertaken
with
a
little
sacrifice
and
he
had
a
second
mule
a
which
it
struck
him
i
might
like
to
ride
now
and
then
a
pleasant
beast
and
a
companion
so
to
speak
for
the
other
one
two
mules
and
two
christians
that
seemed
appropriate
and
only
four
francs
a
day
more
done
it
was
really
cheap
so
cheap
that
i
straightway
grew
suspicious
of
the
we
sealed
the
bargain
in
a
glass
of
the
local
mixture
and
i
thereupon
demanded
a
a
monetary
security
that
he
would
keep
his
word
be
round
at
my
door
with
the
animals
at
two
in
the
morning
so
as
to
reach
the
uplands
before
the
heat
became
oppressive
his
face
clouded
a
good
omen
indicating
that
he
was
beginning
to
respect
me
then
he
pulled
out
his
purse
and
reluctantly
laid
two
francs
on
the
table
the
evening
was
spent
in
final
preparations
i
retired
early
to
bed
and
tried
to
sleep
one
came
and
two
and
three
no
mules
at
four
i
went
to
the
man
house
and
woke
him
out
of
ambrosial
slumbers
you
come
to
see
me
so
early
in
the
morning
he
enquired
sitting
up
in
bed
and
rubbing
his
eyes
now
that
really
nice
of
you
one
of
the
mules
he
airily
explained
had
lost
a
shoe
in
the
afternoon
he
would
get
it
put
right
at
once
at
once
you
might
have
told
me
so
yesterday
evening
instead
of
keeping
me
awake
all
night
waiting
for
you
true
he
replied
i
thought
of
it
at
the
time
but
then
i
went
to
bed
and
slept
ah
sir
it
is
good
to
sleep
and
he
stretched
himself
voluptuously
the
beast
was
shod
and
at
we
left
xviii
african
intruders
there
is
a
type
of
physiognomy
here
which
is
undeniably
semitic
with
curly
hair
dusky
skin
and
hooked
nose
we
may
take
it
to
be
of
saracenic
origin
since
a
phoenician
descent
is
out
of
the
question
while
mediaeval
jews
never
intermarried
with
christians
it
is
the
same
class
of
face
which
one
sees
so
abundantly
at
palermo
the
former
metropolis
of
these
africans
the
accompanying
likeness
is
that
of
a
native
of
cosenza
a
town
that
was
frequently
in
their
possession
eastern
traits
of
character
too
have
lingered
among
the
populace
so
the
humour
of
the
peddling
semite
who
will
allow
himself
to
be
called
by
the
most
offensive
epithets
rather
than
lose
a
chance
of
gaining
a
sou
who
eternally
professing
poverty
can
not
bear
to
be
twitted
on
his
notorious
riches
their
ceaseless
talk
of
hidden
treasures
their
secretiveness
and
so
many
other
little
orientalisms
that
whoever
has
lived
in
the
east
will
be
inclined
to
echo
the
observation
of
edward
lear
greek
servant
these
men
are
arabs
but
they
have
more
clothes
on
many
saracenic
words
chiefly
of
marine
and
commercial
import
have
survived
from
this
period
i
could
quote
a
hundred
or
more
partly
in
the
literary
language
balio
dogana
etc
partly
in
dialect
cala
tavuto
etc
and
in
such
as
tamborio
the
semitic
mount
tabor
kalat
calatafimi
marsa
marsala
dramatic
plays
with
saracen
subjects
are
still
popular
with
the
lower
classes
you
can
see
them
acted
in
any
of
the
coast
towns
in
fact
the
recollection
of
these
intruders
is
very
much
alive
to
this
day
they
have
left
a
deep
scar
such
being
the
case
it
is
odd
to
find
local
writers
hardly
referring
to
the
saracenic
period
even
a
modern
like
who
describes
the
castrovillari
region
in
a
conscientious
fashion
leaps
directly
from
events
into
those
of
the
normans
but
this
is
in
accordance
with
the
ideal
of
writing
such
works
to
say
nothing
in
dispraise
of
your
subject
an
exception
may
be
made
in
favour
of
history
of
reggio
malaria
and
earthquakes
and
saracen
irruptions
are
awkward
arguments
when
treating
of
the
natural
attractions
and
historical
glories
of
your
native
place
so
the
once
renowned
descriptions
of
this
province
by
grano
and
the
rest
of
them
are
little
more
than
rhetorical
exercises
they
are
laus
calabria
and
then
their
sources
of
information
were
limited
and
difficult
of
access
collective
works
like
those
of
muratori
and
du
chesne
had
not
appeared
on
the
market
libraries
were
restricted
to
convents
and
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
they
should
know
all
the
chroniclers
of
the
byzantines
latins
lombards
normans
and
hohenstaufen
to
say
nothing
of
arab
writers
like
nowairi
abulfeda
ibn
chaldun
and
ibn
alathir
who
throw
a
little
light
on
those
dark
times
and
are
now
easily
accessible
to
scholars
dipping
into
this
literature
of
murders
and
prayers
we
gather
that
in
times
the
southern
towns
were
denuded
of
their
garrisons
and
their
fortresses
fallen
into
disrepair

part

as
at
taranto

other
parts
of
old
calabria
the
invaders
had
an
easy
task
before
them
at
first
in
on
their
return
from
salerno
they
poured
into
calabria
and
by
already
held
several
towns
such
as
tropea
and
amantea
but
were
driven
out
temporarily
in
they
ravaged
says
the
country
of
the
lombards
calabria
in
they
destroyed
reggio
and
renewed
their
incursions
in
till
the
greek
emperor
found
it
profitable
to
pay
them
an
annual
tribute
in
this
tribute
not
being
forthcoming
they
defeated
the
greeks
in
calabria
and
made
further
raids
in
carrying
off
a
large
store
of
captives
and
wealth
in
otto

repulsed
them
at
cotrone
but
was
beaten
the
following

narrowly
escaped
capture
it
was
one
of
the
most
romantic
incidents
of
these
wars

the
years

were
continually

the
country

nearly
every

by
some
fresh
inroad
in

took
cosenza
for
the

footnote
i
have

of
view
but
they
never
attained
their
end
the
subjection
of
the

and
their
methods
involved
appalling
and
enduring
evils
yet
the
presumable
intent
or
ambition
of
these
aliens
must
be
called
reasonable
enough
they
wished
to
establish
a
provincial
government
here
on
the
same
lines
as
in
sicily
of
which
island
it
has
been
said
that
it
was
never
more
prosperous
than
under
their
administration
literature
trade
industry
and
all
the
arts
of
peace
are
described
as
flourishing
there
in
agriculture
they
paid
especial
attention
to
the
olive
they
initiated
i
believe
the
art
of
terracing
and
irrigating
the
they
imported
the
the
lemon
and
making
the
latter
suffice
not
only
for
home
consumption
but
for
export
their
silk
manufactures
were
unsurpassed
older
writers
like
mazzella
speak
of
the
abundant
growth
of
in
calabria
capialbi

wallowed
in

has
a
treatise
on
the
subject
john
evelyn
saw
it
cultivated
near
naples
it
is
now
extinct
from
economical
and
possibly
climatic
causes
they
also
introduced
the
papyrus
into
sicily
as
well
as
the
which
used
to
be
common
all
over
south
italy
where
i
have
myself
seen
it
growing
all
this
sounds
praiseworthy
no
doubt
but
i
see
no
reason
why
they
should
have
governed
sicily
better
than
they
did
north
africa
which
crumbled
into
dust
at
their
touch
and
will
take
many
long
centuries
to
recover
its
prosperity
there
is
something
and
in
the
arab
with
his
pastoral
habits
and
contempt
of
forethought
in
favour
of
their
rule
much
capital
has
been
made
out
of
benjamin
of
tudela
account
of
palermo
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
his
brief
visit
was
made
a
hundred
years
after
the
norman
occupation
had
begun
palermo
he
says
has
about
jews
and
a
large
number
of
christians
and
mohammedans
sicily
contains
all
the
pleasant
things
of
this
world
well
so
it
did
in
times
so
it
does
against
the
example
of
north
africa
no
doubt
may
be
set
their
activities
in
spain
they
have
been
accused
of
destroying
the
old
temples
of
magna
gracia
from
religious
or
other
motives
i
do
not
believe
it
this
was
against
their
usual
practice
they
sacked
monasteries
because
these
were
fortresses
defended
by
political
enemies
and
full
of
gold
which
they
coveted
but
in
their
african
possessions
during
all
this
period
the
ruins
of
ancient
civilizations
were
left
untouched
while
byzantine
cults
lingered
peacefully
side
by
side
with
why
not
here
their
fanaticism
has
been
much
exaggerated
weighing
the
balance
between
conflicting
writers
it
would
appear
that
christian
rites
were
tolerated
in
sicily
during
all
their
rule
though
some
governors
were
more
bigoted
than
others
the
proof
is
this
that
the
normans
found
resident
there
after
years
of
arab
domination
it
was
the
christians
rather
who
with
the
best
intentions
set
the
example
of
fanaticism
during
their
crusades
these
early
saracen
raids
had
no
more
religious
colouring
than
our
own
raids
into
the
transvaal
or
elsewhere
the
saracens
were
out
for
plunder
and
fresh
lands
exactly
like
the
english
footnote
the
behaviour
of
the
normans
was
wholly
different
from
that
of
the
arabs
immediately
on
their
occupation
of
the
country
they
razed
to
the
ground
thousands
of
arab
temples
and
sanctuaries
of
several
hundred
in
palermo
alone
not
a
single
one
was
left
standing
nor
were
they
tempted
to
destroy
these
monuments
for
decorative
purposes
since
they
possessed
no
palaces
on
the
mainland
like
the
palermitan
cuba
or
zisa
and
that
sheer
love
of
with
which
they
have
been
credited
certainly
spared
the
marbles
of
paestum
which
lay
within
a
short
distance
of
their
strongholds
agropoli
and
cetara
no
what
earthquakes
had
left
intact
of
these
classic
relics
was
niched
by
the
christians
who
ransacked
every
corner
of
italy
for
such
treasures
to
adorn
their
own
temples
in
pisa
rome
and
venice
displaying
small
veneration
for
antiquity
but
considerable
taste
in
calabria
for
instance
the
twenty
granite
pillars
of
the
cathedral
of
gerace
were
drawn
from
the
ruins
of
old
locri
those
of
melito
came
from
the
ancient
hipponium
monteleone
so
paestum
after
the
saracens
became
a
regular
quarry
for
the
lombards
and
the
rich
citizens
of
amalfi
when
they
built
their
cathedral
and
above
all
for
the
shrewdly
pious
robert
guiscard
altogether
these
normans
dreaming
through
the
solstitial
heats
in
pleasaunces
like
ravello
developed
a
nice
taste
in
the
matter
of
marbles
and
were
not
particular
where
they
came
from
so
long
as
they
came
from
somewhere
the
antiquities
remained
intact
at
least
which
was
better
than
the
subsequent
system
of
colonna
and
frangipani
who
burnt
them
into
lime
whatever
one
may
think
of
the
condition
of
sicily
under
arab
rule
the
proceedings
of
these
strangers
was
wholly
deplorable
so
far
as
the
mainland
of
italy
was
concerned
they
sacked
and
burnt
wherever
they
went
the
of
the
tyrrhenian
ionian
and
adriatic
was
depopulated
of
its
inhabitants
who
fled
inland
towns
and
villages
vanished
from
the
face
of
the
earth
and
the
richly
cultivated
land
became
a
desert
they
took
prisoners
from
reggio
on
a
single
occasion
from
termula
they
reduced
matera
to
such
distress
that
a
mother
is
said
to
have
slaughtered
and
devoured
her
own
child
such
was
their
system
on
the
mainland
where
they
swarmed
their
numbers
can
be
inferred
from
a
letter
written
in
by
the
emperor
ludwig
ii
to
the
byzantine
monarch
in
which
he
complains
that
naples
has
become
a
second
palermo
a
second
africa
while
three
hundred
years
later
in
the
chancellor
konrad
von
hildesheim
makes
a
noteworthy
observation
which
begins
in
naples
i
saw
the
saracens
who
with
their
spittle
destroy
venomous
beasts
and
will
briefly
set
forth
how
they
came
by
this
virtue

me
for
i
am
a
son
of
maria
it
is
therefore
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
coastal
regions
of
south
italy
were
practically
in
arab
possession
for
centuries
and
one
is
tempted
to
dwell
on
their
long
here
because
it
has
affected
to
this
day
the
vocabulary
of
the
people
their
lore
their
architecture
their
very
faces
and
to
a
far
greater
extent
than
a
visitor
unacquainted
with
moslem
countries
and
habits
would
believe
saracenism
explains
many
anomalies
in
their
mode
of
life
and
social
conduct
from
these
troublous
times
dates
i
should
say
that
use
of
the
word
applied
to
natives
of
the
country
as
opposed
to
mohammedan
enemies
saraceno
is
still
a
common
term
of
abuse
the
fall
of
luceria
may
be
taken
as
a
convenient
to
mark
the
end
of
the
saracenic
period
a
lull
but
no
complete
repose
from
attacks
occurs
between
that
event
and
the
fall
of
granada
then
begins
the
activity
of
the
corsairs
there
is
this
difference
between
them
that
the
corsairs
merely
paid
flying
visits
a
change
of
wind
the
appearance
of
an
italian
sail
an
unexpected
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
inhabitants
sufficed
to
unsettle
their
ephemeral
plans
the
were
never
in
their
possession
they
only
harried
the
natives
the
system
of
the
saracens
on
the
mainland
though
it
seldom
attained
the
form
of
a
provincial
or
even
military
government
was
different
they
had
the
where
they
dined
they
slept
in
point
of
destructiveness
i
should
think
there
was
little
to
choose
between
them
one
thinks
of
the
hundreds
of
villages
the
corsairs
devastated
the
convents
and
precious
archives
they
destroyed
footnote
in
this
particular
branch
again
the
christians
surpassed
the
unbeliever
more
archives
were
destroyed
in
the
age
of
lead
the
closing
period
of
than
under
saracens
and
corsairs
combined
it
was
quite
the
regular
thing
to
sell
them
as
to
the
shopkeepers
some
of
them
escaped
this
fate
by
the
veriest
miracle
so
those
of
the
celebrated
certoza
of
san
lorenzo
in
padula
the
historian
marincola
walking
in
the
market
of
salerno
noticed
a
piece
of
cheese
wrapped
up
in
an
old
parchment
he
elicited
the
fact
that
it
came
from
this
certosa
intercepted
the
records
on
their
way
for
sale
in
salerno
and
contrived
by
a
small
present
to
the
driver
that
next
night
two
cartloads
of
parchments
were
deposited
in
the
library
of
la
cava
the
thousands
of
captives
they
carried
off
sometimes
in
such
numbers
that
the
ships
threatened
to
sink
till
the
more
unsaleable
portion
of
the
human
freight
had
been
cast
overboard
and
it
went
on
for
centuries
pirates
and
they
were
but
not
a
whit
more
so
than
their
christian
adversaries
on
whose
national
rivalries
they
thrived
african
slaves
when
not
chained
to
the
galleys
were
utilized
on

so
the
traveller
moore
records
that
the
palace
of
caserta
was
built
by
gangs
of
slaves
half
of
them
italian
half
turkish
we
have
not
much
testimony
as
to
whether
these
arab
slaves
enjoyed
their
lot
in
european
countries
but
many
of
the
christians
in
algiers
certainly
enjoyed

a
considerable
number
of
them

myself

of
a
man
who
had
been
thus
sent
back
to
his
relations
from

who
soon
enough
returned
to
africa
declaring
that
the
climate
and

of

were
alike
insupportable

i
question
whether
the
turks
were
ever
guilty
of
a
corresponding
infamy
this
parrino
by
the
way
is
useful
as
showing
the
trouble
to
which
the
spanish

were
put
by
the
perpetual

of

local

the
daring
of

knew
no

they
actually
landed

and
carried
off
a
number
of

the

sometimes
we
see
the
pleasing
spectacle
of
two
patrons

joining
their
forces
to
ward
off
a
piratical
attack
upon
some
threatened

by

in

there
is
no
doubt
that
these
inroads
acted
as
a
stimulus
to
the
christian
faith
that
they
helped
to
seat

a
thousand

from

up
to
those
of
the

these

evil
it

well
for

speak

the

too
might
have
something
to

on

point
the
fact
is
that
neither

no

could
tell

the

by
this

they
gave

a
number
of
explanations
all
fanciful
and
unconvincing
pollino
we
are
told
is
derived
from
apollo
and
authors
of

sometimes
write
of
it
as

barrius
suggests
an
alternative
etymology
equally
absurd

connected
with

we
all
have
a
fling
at
this
strabo
and
pliny
of
calabria
so
jealous
was
he
of
his
work
that
he
procured
a
prohibition
from
the
pope
against
all
who
might
reprint
it
and
furthermore
invoked
the
curses
of
heaven
and
earth
upon
whoever
should
have
the
audacity
to
translate
it

his

as
regards
his
infallibility
one
must
not
forget
that
among
his
contemporaries
the
more
discerning
had
already
censured
his
his
immoderate
love
of
calabria
and
that
is
the
right
way
to
judge
of
men
who
were
not
so
much
ignorant
as
unduly
zealous
for
the
fair
name
of
their
natal
land
to
sneer
at
them
is
to
misjudge
their
period
it
was
the
very
spirit
of
the
renaissance
to
press
rhetorical
learning
into
the
service
of
patriotism
they
made
some
happy
guesses
and
not
a
few
mistakes
and
when
they
lied
deliberately
it
was
done
in
what
they
held
a
just
cause
as
scholars
and
gentlemen
the
of
fiore
also
fares
badly
at
the
hands
of
critics
but
i
shall
not
repeat
what
they
say
i
confess
to
a
sneaking
fondness
for
father
fiore
marafioti
a
calabrian
monk
likewise
dwells
on
these
same
herbs
of
pollino
and
gives
a
long
account
of
a
medical
secret
which
he
learnt
on
the
spot
from
two
armenian
botanists
alas
for
marafioti
despite
his
excellent
index
and
seductively
chaste
paduan
type
and
paper
the
impartial
soria
is
driven
to
say
that
to
make
his
shop
appear
more
rich
in
foreign
merchandise
he
did
not
scruple
to
adorn
it
with
books
and
authors
apocryphal
imaginary
and
unknown
to
the
whole
human
race
in
short
he
belonged
to
the
school
of
pratilli
who
wrote
a
wise
and
edifying
history
of
capua
on
the
basis
of
inscriptions
which
he
himself
had
previously
forged
of
ligorio
pirro
prince
of
his
tribe
who
manufactured
thousands
of
coins
texts
and
marbles
out
of
sheer
exuberance
of
creative
artistry
gone
are
those
happy
days
of
authorship
when
the
constructive
imagination
was
not
yet
blighted
and
withered
marching
comfortably
it
will
take
you
nearly
twelve
hours
to
go
from
morano
to
the
village
of
terranova
di
pollino
which
i
selected
as
my
first
this
includes
a
scramble
up
the
peak
of
pollino
locally
termed
telegrafo
from
a
pile
of
stones
an
old
erected
on
the
summit
but
since
decent
accommodation
can
only
be
obtained
at
castrovillari
a
start
should
be
made
from
there
and
this
adds
another
hour
to
the
trip
moreover
as
the
peak
of
pollino
lies
below
that
of
dolcedorme
which
shuts
oil
a
good
deal
of
its
view
seaward
this
second
mountain
ought
rather
to
be
ascended
and
that
will
probably
add
yet
another
hour
fourteen
altogether
the
natives
ever
ready
to
say
what
they
think
will
please
you
call
it
a
six
hours
excursion
as
a
matter
of
fact
although
i
spoke
to
numbers
of
the
population
of
morano
i
only
met
two
men
who
had
ever
been
to
terranova
one
of
them
being
my
muleteer
the
majority
had
not
so
much
as
heard
its
name
they
dislike
mountains
and
torrents
and
forests
not
only
as
an
offence
to
the
eye
but
as
hindrances
to
agriculture
and
enemies
of
man
and
his
ordered
ways
la
montagna
is
considerably
abused
all
over

it
takes
an
hour
to
cross
the

and
reach
the
slopes
of
the
opposite
hills
here
on
the
plain
lie
the
now
faded

of
the
monstrous
arum
the
botanical
glory
of
these
regions
to
see
it
in

in

is
alone
almost
worth
the
trouble
of
a
journey
to
calabria
on
a
shady
eminence
at
the
foot
of
these
mountains
in
a
most
picturesque
site
there
stands
a
large
castellated
building

a
ruin

as

have
charmed

i
have
never
been

be
very
rare

it
certainly
was
printed

and
wearisome
limestone
gap
called

only
the
last
of
the
march
being
shaded
by

it
was
in
this
gully
that
an
accidental
encounter
took
place
between
a
detachment
of
french
soldiers
and
part
of
the
band
of
the
celebrated
brigand
scarolla
whom
they
had
been
pursuing
for
months
all
over
the
country
the
brigands
were
sleeping
when
the
others
fell
upon
them
killing
numbers
and
carrying
off
a
large
booty
so
rich
it
was
that
the
soldiers
were
seen
playing
at
petis
palets

that
may
be
with
quadruples
of

whatever
may

wounded
but
was
afterwards
handed
over
to
justice
for
a
consideration
of
a
thousand
ducats
by
some
shepherds
with
whom
he
had
taken
refuge
and
duly
hanged
his
band
consisted
of
four
thousand
ruffians
it
was
one
of
several
that
infested
south
italy
this
gives
some
idea
of
the
magnitude
of
the
evil
it
was
my
misfortune
that
after
weeks
of
serene
weather
this
particular
morning
should
be
cloudy
there
was
sunshine
in
the
valley
below
but
wreaths
of
mist
were
skidding
over
the
summit
of
pollino
the
view
i
felt
sure
would
be
spoilt
and
so
it
was
through
i
caught
glimpses
of
the
plain
and
the
blue
ionian
of
the
sila
range
confronting
me
of
the
peak
of
dolcedorme
to
the
left
and
the
montagna
del
principe
on
the
right
of
the
large
forest
region
at
my
back
tantalizing
visions
viewed
from
below
this
pollino
is
shaped
like
a
pyramid
and
promises
rather
a
steep
climb
over
bare
limestone
but
the
ascent
is
quite
easy
no
trees
grow
on
the
pyramid
the
rock
is
covered
with
a
profusion
of
and
gay
pansies
some
and
a
few
dwarfed
junipers
nearly
reach
the
summit
when
i
passed
here
on
a
former
trip
on
the
of
june
this
peak
was
shrouded
in
snow
there
are
some
patches
of
snow
even
now
one
of
them
descending
in
glacier
fashion
down
the
slope
on
the
other
side
they
call
it
eternal
but
i
question
whether
it
will
survive
the
heats
of
autumn
beyond
a
brace
of
partridges
i
saw
no
birds
whatever
this
group
of
pollino
descending
its
seven
thousand
feet
in
a
precipitous
flight
of
terraces
to
the
plain
of
sibari
is
an
imposing
to
the
apennines
that
have
run
hitherward
without
a
break
from
genoa
and
bologna
westward
of
this
spot
there
are
mountains
galore
but
no
more
apennines
no
more
limestone
precipices
the
boundary
of
the
old
provinces
of
calabria
and
basilicata
ran
over
this
spot
i
was
glad
to
descend
once
more
and
to
reach
the
di
pollino
alpine
meadow
with
a
little
lake
the
merest
puddle
bright
with
rare
and
beautiful
flowers
it
lies
metres
above
and
no
one
who
visits
these
regions
should
omit
to
see
this
exquisite
tract
encircled
by
mountain
peaks
though
it
lies
a
little
off
the
usual
paths
strawberries
which
i
had
eaten
at
rossano
had
not
yet
opened
their
flowers
here
the
flora
boreal
in
parts
has
been
studied
by
terracciano
and
other
italian
botanists
it
was
on
this
verdant
mead
that
fatigued
with
the
climb
i
thought
to
try
the
powers
of
my
riding
mule
but
the
beast
proved
vicious
there
was
no
staying
on
her
back
a
piece
of
string
attached
to
her
nose
by
way
of
was
useless
as
a
rein
she
had
no
mane
wherewith
i
might
have
steadied
myself
in
moments
of
danger
and
as
to
seizing
her
ears
for
that
purpose
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
hardly
was
i
in
the
saddle
before
her
head
descended
to
the
ground
and
there
remained
while
her
hinder
feet
essayed
to
touch
the
stars
after
a
succession
of
ignominious
and
painful
flights
to
earth
i
complained
to
her
owner
who
had
been
watching
the
proceedings
with
quiet
interest
that
he
said
is
good
at
carrying
loads
but
she
has
never
had
a
christian
on
her
back
till
now
i
was
rather
curious
to
see
how
she
would
behave
dio
and
do
you
expect
me
to
pay
four
francs
a
day
for
having
my
bones
broken
in
this
fashion
what
would
you
sir
she
is
still
young
barely
four
years
old
only
wait
wait
till
she
is
ten
or
twelve
to
do
him
justice
however
he
tried
to
make
amends
in
other
ways
and
he
certainly
knew
the
tracks
but
he
was
a
returned
emigrant
and
when
an
italian
has
once
crossed
the
ocean
he
is
useless
for
my
purposes
he
has
lost
his
savour
the
virtue
has
gone
out
of
him
true
italians
will
soon
be
rare
as
the
dodo
in
these
parts
these
cast
off
their
ancient
animistic
traits
and
patriarchal
disposition
with
the
ease
of
a
serpent
a
new
creature
emerges
of
a
wholly
different
character
sophisticated
extortionate
at
times
often
practical
and
in
so
far
useful
scorner
of
every
tradition
infernally
wideawake
and
curiously
deficient
in
what
the
germans
call
gemuet
one
of
those
words
which
we
sadly
need
in
our
own
language
instead
of
being
regaled
with
tales
of
saint
venus
and
fairies
and
the
evil
eye
i
learnt
a
good
deal
about
the
price
of
food
in
the
brazilian
highlands
the
only
piece
of
local
information
i
was
able
to
draw
from
him
concerned
a
mysterious
plant
in
the
forest
that
shines
by
night
i
dare
say
he
meant
the
fraxinella
which
is
sometimes
luminous
the
finest
part
of
the
forest
was
traversed
in
the
afternoon
it
is
called
janace
and
composed
of
firs
and
beeches
the
botanist
tenore
says
that
firs
feet
in
height
are
not
difficult
to
find
here
and
some
of
the
beeches
a
forestal
inspector
assured
me
attain
the
height
of
metres
they
shoot
up
in
straight
silvery
trunks
their
roots
are
often
intertwined
with
those
of
the
firs
the
track
is
not
level
by
any
means
there
are
torrents
to
be
crossed
rocky
ravines
with
splashing
waters
where
the
sunshine
pours
down
through
a
dense
network
of
branches
upon
a
carpet
of
russet
leaves
and
grey
boulders
the
envious
beeches
allowing
of
no
vegetation
at
their
feet
occasional
meadows
too
bright
with
buttercups
and
orchids
no
pines
whatever
grow
in
this
forest
yet
a
few
stunted
ones
are
seen
clinging
to
the
precipices
that
descend
into
the
coscile
valley
their
seeds
may
have
been
wafted
across
from
the
sila
mountains
in
olden
days
all
this
country
was
full
of
game
bears
stags
and
are
mentioned
only
wolves
and
a
few
are
now
left
the
forest
is
sombre
but
not
gloomy
and
one
would
like
to
spend
some
time
in
these
wooded
regions
so
rare
in
italy
and
to
study
their
life
and
character
but
how
set
about
it
the
distances
are
great
there
are
no
houses
not
even
a
shepherd
hut
or
a
cave
the
cold
at
night
is
severe
and
even
in
the
height
of
midsummer
one
must
be
prepared
for
spells
of
mist
and
rain
i
shall
be
tempted
on
another
occasion
to
provide
myself
with
a
tent
such
as
is
supplied
to
military
officers
they
are
light
and
handy
and
perhaps
camping
out
with
a
of
the
kind
that
one
finds
in
the
abruzzi
provinces
would
be
altogether
the
best
way
of
seeing
the
remoter
parts
of
south
and
central
italy
for
decent
can
generally
be
obtained
in
the
smallest
places
the
drawback
is
that
nobody
can
cook
them
dirty
food
by
day
and
dirty
beds
by
night
will
daunt
the
most
enterprising
natures
in
the
long
run
these
tracks
are
only
traversed
in
summer
when
i
last
walked
through
this
region
in
the
reverse
direction
from
lagonegro
over
latronico
and
san
severino
to
castrovillari
the
ground
was
still
covered
with
stretches
of
snow
and
many
brooks
were
difficult
to
cross
from
the
swollen
waters
this
was
in
june
it
was
odd
to
see
the
beeches
rising
in
full
leaf
out
of
the
deep
snow
during
this
afternoon
ramble
i
often
wondered
what
the
burghers
of
taranto
would
think
of
these
sylvan
solitudes
doubtless
they
would
share
the
opinion
of
a
genteel
photographer
of
morano
who
showed
me
some
coloured
pictures
of
local
brides
in
their
appropriate
costumes
such
as
are
sent
to
relatives
in
america
after
weddings
he
possessed
a
good
camera
and
i
asked
whether
he
had
never
made
any
pictures
of
this
fine
forest
scenery
no
he
said
he
had
only
once
been
to
the
festival
of
the
madonna
di
pollino
but
he
went
alone
his
companion
an
got
frightened
and
failed
to
appear
at
the
last
moment
so
i
went
alone
he
said
and
those
forests
it
must
be
confessed
are
too
savage
to
be
photographed
now
if
my
friend
had
come
he
might
have
posed
for
me
sitting
comically
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
with
crossed
legs
and
smoking
a
cigar
like
this
or
he
might
have
pretended
to
be
a
bending
forwards
and
felling
a
tree
tac
tac
tac
without
his
jacket
of
course
that
would
have
made
a
picture
but
those
woods
and
mountains
all
by
themselves
no
the
camera
revolts
in
photography
as
in
all
good
art
the
human
element
must
predominate
it
is
sad
to
think
that
in
a
few
years
time
nearly
all
these
forests
will
have
ceased
to
exist
another
generation
will
hardly
recognize
the
site
of
them
a
society
from
morbegno
valtellina
has
acquired
rights
over
the
timber
and
is
hewing
down
as
fast
as
it
can
they
import
their
own
workmen
from
north
italy
and
have
built
at
a
cost
of
two
million
francs
say
the
newspapers
a
special
funicular
railway
kilometres
long
to
carry
the
trunks
from
the
mountain
to
francavilla
at
its
foot
where
they
are
sawn
up
and
conveyed
to
the
railway
station
of
cerchiara
near
sibari
this
concession
i
am
told
extends
to
years
they
have
now
been
at
work
for
two
and
the
results
are
already
apparent
in
some
almost
bare
slopes
once
clothed
with
these
huge
primeval
trees
there
are
inspectors
some
of
them
conscientious
to
see
that
a
due
proportion
of
the
timber
is
left
standing
but
we
all
know
what
the
average
italian
official
is
and
must
be
considering
his
salary
one
could
hardly
blame
them
greatly
if
as
i
have
been
assured
is
the
case
they
often
sell
the
wood
which
they
are
paid
to
protect
the
same
fate
is
about
to
overtake
the
extensive
hill
forests
which
lie
on
the
watershed
between
morano
and
the
tyrrhenian
these
according
to
a
castrovillari
local
paper
have
lately
been
sold
to
a
german
firm
for
exploitation
it
is
useless
to
lament
the
inevitable
this
modern
obsession
of
industrialism
which
has
infected
a
country
purely
agricultural
nor
is
it
any
great
compensation
to
observe
that
certain
small
tracts
of
behind
morano
are
being
carefully
reafforested
by
the
government
at
this
moment
whoever
wishes
to
see
these
beautiful
stretches
of
woodland
ere
their
disappearance
from
earth
let
him
hasten
after
leaving
the
forest
region
it
is
a
downhill
walk
of
nearly
three
hours
to
reach
terranova
di
pollino
which
lies
only
metres
above
against
the
slope
of
a
wide
and
golden
amphitheatre
of
hills
at
whose
entrance
the
river
sarmento
has
carved
itself
a
prodigious
gateway
through
the
rock
a
dirty
little
place
the
male
inhabitants
are
nearly
all
in
america
the
old
women
nearly
all
afflicted
with
goitre
i
was
pleased
to
observe
the
calabrian
system
of
the
which
life
in
civilized
places
had
made
me
forget
these
doors
are
divided
into
two
portions
not
vertically
like
ours
but
horizontally
the
upper
portion
is
generally
open
in
order
that
the
housewife
sitting
within
may
have
light
and
air
in
her
room
and
an
opportunity
of
gossiping
with
her
neighbours
across
the
street
the
lower
part
is
closed
to
prevent
the
pigs
in
the
daytime
from
entering
the
house
where
they
sleep
at
night
the
system
testifies
to
social
instincts
and
a
certain
sense
of
refinement
the
sights
of
terranova
are
soon
exhausted
they
had
spoken
to
me
of
a
house
near
the
woods
about
four
hours
distant
inhabited
just
now
by
shepherds
thither
we
started
next
day
at
about
the
road
climbs
upwards
through
bare
country
till
it
reaches
a
dusky
pinnacle
of
rock
a
conspicuous
landmark
which
looks
volcanic
but
is
nothing
of
the
kind
it
bears
the
name
of
the
explanation
of
this
odd
pleonasm
being
i
suppose
that
here
the
whole
mass
of
rock
generally
decked
with
grass
or
shrubs
is
as
bare
as
any
single
stone
there
followed
a
pleasant
march
through
pastoral
country
of
streamlets
and
lush
grass
with
noble
views
downwards
on
our
right
over
hills
into
the
distant
valley
of
the
sinno
to
the
left
is
the
forest
region
but
the
fir
trees
are
generally
mutilated
their
lower
branches
lopped
off
and
the
tree
resents
this
treatment
and
often
dies
remaining
a
melancholy
stump
among
the
beeches
they
take
these
branches
not
for
fuel
but
as
fodder
for
the
cows
a
curious
kind
of
fodder
one
thinks
but
calabrian
cows
will
eat
anything
and
their
milk
tastes
accordingly
no
wonder
the
natives
prefer
even
the
greasy
fluid
of
their
goats
to
that
of
cows
how
they
will
ask
you
englishmen
with
all
your
money
you
drink
the
milk
of
cows
goats
are
here
and
the
hollies
oaks
and
thorns
along
the
path
have
been
gnawed
by
them
into
quaint
patterns
like
the
topiarian
work
in
gardens
if
they
find
nothing
to
their
taste
on
the
ground
they
actually
climb
trees
i
have
seen
them
browsing
thus
at
six
feet
above
the
ground
these
miserable
beasts
are
the
ruin
of
south
italy
as
they
are
of
the
whole
mediterranean
basin
what
malaria
and
the
barbary
pirates
have
done
to
the
the
goats
have
accomplished
for
the
regions
further
inland
and
it
is
really
time
that
sterner
legislation
were
introduced
to
limit
their
and
incidentally
reduce
their
numbers
as
has
been
done
in
parts
of
the
abruzzi
to
the
great
credit
of
the
authorities
but
the
subject
is
a
one
the
solitary
little
house
which
now
appeared
before
us
is
called
vitiello
presumably
from
its
owner
or
builder
a
proprietor
of
the
village
of
noepoli
it
stands
in
a
charming
site
with
a
background
of
woodland
whence
rivulets
trickle
down
the
immediate
surroundings
are
covered
with
pasture
and
bracken
and
wild
pear
trees
smothered
in
flowering
i
strolled
about
in
the
sunset
amid
tinkling
herds
of
sheep
and
goats
that
were
presently
milked
and
driven
into
their
enclosure
of
thorns
for
the
night
guarded
by
four
or
five
of
those
savage
white
dogs
of
the
campagna
breed
despite
these
protectors
the
wolf
carried
off
two
sheep
yesterday
in
broad
daylight
the
flocks
come
to
these
heights
in
the
middle
of
june
and
descend
again
in
october
the
shepherds
offered
us
the
only
fare
they
possessed
the
pollino
cheeses
the
same
that
were
made
long
ago
by
polyphemus
himself
you
can
get
them
down
at
a
pinch
on
the
principle
of
the
german
proverb
when
the
devil
is
hungry
he
eats
flies
fortunately
our
bags
still
contained
a
varied
assortment
though
my
man
had
developed
an
appetite
and
a
thirst
that
did
credit
to
his
berserker
ancestry
we
retired
early
but
long
after
the
rest
of
them
were
snoring
hard
i
continued
awake
shivering
under
my
blanket
and
choking
with
the
acrid
smoke
of
a
fire
of
green
timber
the
door
had
been
left
ajar
to
allow
it
to
escape
but
the
only
result
of
this
arrangement
was
that
a
glacial
blast
of
wind
swept
into
the
chamber
from
outside
the
night
was
bitterly
cold
and
the
wooden
floor
on
which
i
was
reposing
seemed
to
be
harder
than
the
majority
of
its
kind
i
thought
with
regret
of
the
tepid
nights
of
taranto
and
castrovillari
and
cursed
my
folly
for
climbing
into
these
arctic
regions
wondering
as
i
have
often
done
what
demon
of
restlessness
or
perversity
drives
one
to
undertake
such
insane
excursions
xx
a
mountain
festival
leaving
the
hospitable
shepherds
in
the
morning
we
arrived
after
midday
by
devious
woodland
paths
at
the
madonna
di
pollino
this
solitary
fane
is
perched
like
an
eagle
nest
on
the
edge
of
a
cliff
overhanging
the
frida
torrent
owing
to
this
fact
and
to
its
great
elevation
the
views
inland
are
wonderful
especially
towards
evening
when
crude
daylight
tints
fade
away
and
range
after
range
of
mountains
reveal
themselves
their
crests
outlined
against
each
other
in
tender
gradations
of
mauve
and
grey
the
prospect
is
closed
at
last
by
the
lofty
groups
of
sirino
and
alburno
many
long
leagues
away
on
all
other
sides
are
forests
interspersed
with
rock
but
near
at
hand
lies
a
spacious
green
meadow
at
the
foot
of
a
precipice
this
is
now
covered
with
encampments
in
anticipation
of
festival
and
the
bacchanal
is
already
in
full
swing
very
few
foreigners
they
say
have
attended
this
annual
feast
which
takes
place
on
the
first
saturday
and
sunday
of
july
and
is
worth
coming
a
long
way
to
see
here
the
old
types
by
modernism
and
emigration
are
still
gathered
together
the
whole
is
represented
the
peasants
have
climbed
up
with
their
entire
households
from
thirty
or
forty
villages
of
this
thinly
populated
land
some
of
them
marching
a
two
days
journey

as

paulinus
sang
nearly
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
it
is
a
vast
picnic
in
honour
of
the
virgin
two
thousand
persons
are
encamped
about
the
chapel
amid
a
formidable
army
of
donkeys
and
mules
whose
braying
mingles
with
the
pastoral
music
of
reeds
and
bagpipes
bagpipes
of
two
kinds
the
common
calabrian
variety
and
that
of
basilicata
much
larger
and
with
a
resounding
base
key
which
will
soon
cease
to
exist
a
heaving
ebb
and
flow
of
humanity
fills
the
eye
fires
are
flickering
before
extempore
shelters
and
an
ungodly
amount
of
food
is
being
consumed
as
traditionally
prescribed
for
such
occasions
si
mangia
per
divozione
on
all
sides
picturesque
groups
of
dancers
indulge
in
the
old
peasants
measure
the
to
the
droning
of
bagpipes
a
demure
kind
of
tarantella
the
male
capering
about
with
attitudes
of
invitation
and
snappings
of
fingers
his
partner
evading
the
advances
with
downcast
eyes
and
the
church
meanwhile
is
filled
to
overflowing
orations
and
services
follow
one
another
without
interruption
the
priests
are
having
a
busy
time
of
it
the
rocky
pathway
between
this
chapel
and
the
meadow
is
obstructed
by
folk
and
lined
on
either
side
with
temporary
booths
of
green
branches
whose
owners
vociferously
extol
the
merits
of
their
wares
cloths
woollens
umbrellas
hot
coffee
wine
fresh
meat
fruit
vegetables
the
spectre
of
cholera
is
abroad
but
no
one
heeds
as
well
as
gold
watches
rings
and
brooches
many
of
which
will
be
bought
ere
morning
in
memory
of
tender
meetings
the
most
interesting
shops
are
those
which
display
waxen
reproductions
of
various
ailing
parts
of
the
body
which
have
been
miraculously
cured
by
the
virgin
intercession
arms
legs
fingers
breasts
eyes
there
are
also
entire
infants
of
wax
strangest
of
all
of
them
is
a
and
puzzling
waxen
symbol
which
sums
up
all
the
internal
organs
of
the
abdomen
in
one
bold
effort
of
artistic
condensation
a
kind
of
heraldic
materialized
i
would
have
carried
one
away
with
me
had
there
been
the
slightest
chance
of
its
remaining
unbroken
footnote
a
good
part
of
these
i
dare
say
arc
intended
to
represent
the
enlarged
spleen
of
malaria
in
old
greece
says
rouse
votives
of
the
trunk
are
commonest
after
the
eyes
malaria
again
these
are
the
votive
offerings
which
catch
the
visitor
eye
in
southern
churches
and
were
beloved
not
only
of
heathendom
but
of
the
neolithic
gentry
a
large
deposit
has
been
excavated
at
taranto
the
british
museum
has
some
of
marble
from
athens
others
were
of
silver
but
the
majority
the
custom
must
have
entered
christianity
in
early
ages
for
already
who
died
in
says
some
bring
images
of
eyes
others
of
feet
others
of
hands
and
sometimes
they
are
made
of
gold
sometimes
of
silver
these
votive
gifts
testify
to
cure
of
maladies
nowadays
when
they
become
too
numerous
they
are
melted
down
for
candles
so
pericles
in
some
speech
talks
of
selling
them
for
the
benefit
of
the
commonwealth
one
is
struck
with
the
feast
of
costumes
here
by
far
the
brightest
being
those
of
the
women
who
have
come
up
from
the
seven
or
eight
albanian
villages
that
surround
these
hills
in
their
variegated
array
of
and
white
of
and
gold
and
flashing
violet
these
dames
move
about
the
sward
like
animated
tropical
flowers
but
the
albanian
girls
of
cività
stand
out
for
aristocratic
elegance
pleated
black
silk
gowns
discreetly
trimmed
with
gold
and
white
lace
and
open
at
the
breast
the
women
of
morano
too
make
a
brave
show
night
brings
no
respite
on
the
contrary
the
din
grows
livelier
than
ever
fires
gleam
brightly
on
the
meadow
and
under
the
trees
the
dancers
are
unwearied
the
bagpipers
with
their
brazen
lungs
show
no
signs
of
exhaustion
and
presently
the
municipal
music
of
castrovillari
specially
hired
for
the
occasion
ascends
an
improvised
bandstand
and
pours
brisk
strains
into
the
night
then
the
fireworks
begin
sensational
fireworks
that
have
cost
a
mint
of
money
flaring
wheels
and
fiery
devices
that
send
forth
a
pungent
odour
rockets
of
many
hues
lighting
up
the
leafy
recesses
and
scaring
the
owls
and
wolves
for
miles
around
certain
persons
have
told
me
that
if
you
are
of
a
prying
disposition
now
is
the
time
to
observe
amorous
couples
walking
hand
in
hand
into
the
gloom
passionate
young
lovers
from
different
villages
who
have
looked
forward
to
this
night
of
all
the
year
on
the
chance
of
meeting
at
last
in
a
fervent
embrace
under
the
friendly
beeches
these
same
stern
men
they
are
always
men
declare
that
such
nocturnal
festivals
are
a
disgrace
to
civilization
that
the
greek
comedy
long
ago
reprobated
them
as
disastrous
to
the
morals
of
females
that
they
were
condemned
by
the
council
of
elvira
by
vigilantius
of
marseilles
and
by
the
great
saint
jerome
who
wrote
that
on
such
occasions
no
virgin
should
wander
a
from
her
mother
they
wish
you
to
believe
that
on
these
warm
summer
nights
when
the
pulses
of
nature
are
felt
and
senses
stirred
with
music
and
wine
and
dance
the
madre
di
is
adored
in
a
manner
less
becoming
christian
youths
and
maidens
than
heathens
celebrating
mad
orgies
to
in
daphne
or
the
babylonian
groves
where
she
was
not
worshipped
at
all
though
she
might
have
been
in
fact
they
insinuate
that
it
may
well
be
true
what
were
the
moralists
doing
there
festivals
like
this
are
relics
of
paganism
and
have
my
cordial
approval
we
english
ought
to
have
learnt
by
this
time
that
the
repression
of
pleasure
is
a
dangerous
error
in
these
days
when
even
italy
the
has
become
tainted
with
principles
there
is
nothing
like
a
little
bestiality
for
restoring
the
circulation
and
putting
things
to
rights
generally
on
ethical
grounds
alone
as
such
nocturnal
feasts
ought
to
be
kept
up
in
regions
such
as
these
where
the
have
not
our
facilities
who
would
grudge
them
these
primordial
joys
conducted
under
the
indulgent
motherly
eye
of
madonna
and
hallowed
by
antiquity
and
the
starlit
heavens
above
every
one
is
so
happy
and
no
bawling
no
quarrelsomeness
no
staggering
tipplers
a
spirit
of
universal
good
cheer
broods
over
the
assembly
involuntarily
one
thinks
of
the
field
of
battle
at
the
close
of
our
highland
games
one
thinks
of
glasgow
on
a
saturday
evening
and
of
certain
other
aspects
of
glasgow
life
i
accepted
the
kindly
proffered
invitation
of
the
priests
to
share
their
dinner
they
held
out
hopes
of
some
sort
of
sleeping
accommodation
as
well
it
was
a
patriarchal
hospitality
before
that
fire
of
logs
the
night
had
grown
chilly
and
several
other
guests
partook
of
it
forestal
inspectors
and
notabilities
one
lady
among
them
who
true
to
feudal
traditions
hardly
spoke
a
word
the
whole
evening
i
was
struck
as
i
have
sometimes
been
at
the
attainments
of
these
country
priests
they
certainly
knew
our
gargantuan
novelists
of
the
victorian
epoch
uncommonly
well
can
it
be
that
these
great
authors
are
more
readable
in
italian
translations
than
in
the
original
one
of
them
took
to
relating
in
a
strain
of
autumnal
humour
experiences
of
his
life
in
the
wilds
of
bolivia
where
he
had
spent
many
years
among
the
indians
my
neighbour
meanwhile
proved
to
be
steeped
in
horatian
lore
it
was
his
pet
theory
supported
by
a
wealth
of
aptly
cited
lines
that
horace
was
a
typical
italian
countryman
and
great
was
his
delight
on
discovering
that
i
shared
his
view
and
could
even
add
another
somewhat
improper
utterance
of
the
poet
to
his
store
of
illustrative
quotations
they
belonged
to
the
old
school
these
sable
philosophers
to
the
days
when
the
priest
was
arbiter
of
life
and
death
and
his
mere
word
sufficient
to
send
a
man
to
the
galleys
when
the
cleverest
boys
of
wealthy
and
influential
families
were
chosen
for
the
secular
career
and
carefully
one
might
say
liberally
trained
to
fulfil
those
responsible
functions
the
type
is
becoming
extinct
the
responsibility
is
gone
the
profession
has
lost
its
glamour
and
only
the
clever
sons
of
pauper
families
or
the
dull
ones
of
the
rich
are
now
tempted
to
forsake
the
worldly
path
regarding
the
origin
of
this
festival
i
learned
that
it
was
tradition
it
had
been
suggested
to
me
that
the
virgin
had
appeared
to
a
shepherd
in
some
cave
near
at
hand
the
usual
virgin
in
the
usual
cave
a
cave
which
in
the
present
instance
no
one
was
able
to
point
out
to
me
traditio
ne
quaeras
my
hosts
answered
questions
on
this
subject
with
benignant
ambiguity
and
did
not
trouble
to
defend
the
divine
apparition
on
the
sophistical
lines
laid
down
in
riccardi
santuari
the
truth
i
imagine
is
that
they
have
very
sensibly
not
concerned
themselves
with
inventing
an
original
legend
the
custom
of
congregating
here
on
these
fixed
days
seems
to
be
recent
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
has
been
called
into
being
by
the
zeal
of
some
local
men
of
standing
on
the
other
hand
a
shrine
may
well
have
stood
for
many
years
on
this
spot
for
it
marks
the
house
in
the
arduous
two
days
journey
between
san
severino
and
a
summer
that
must
date
from
hoary
antiquity
our
bedroom
contained
two
rough
couches
which
were
to
be
shared
between
four
priests
and
myself
despite
the
fact
that
i
occupied
the
place
of
honour
between
the
two
oldest
and
wisest
of
my
ghostly
entertainers
sleep
refused
to
come
the
din
outside
had
grown
to
a
pandemonium
i
lay
awake
till
at
one
of
them
arose
and
touched
the
others
with
a
whispered
and
they
retired
on
tiptoe
to
the
next
room
noiselessly
closing
the
door
to
prepare
themselves
for
early
service
i
could
hear
them
splashing
vigorously
at
their
ablutions
in
the
icy
water
and
wondered
dreamily
how
many
neapolitan
priests
would
indulge
at
that
chill
hour
of
the
morning
in
such
a
lustrai
rite
prescribed
as
it
is
by
the
rules
of
decency
and
of
their
church
after
that
i
stretched
forth
at
my
ease
and
endeavoured
to
repose
seriously
there
were
occasional
lulls
now
in
the
carnival
but
explosions
of
sound
still
broke
the
stillness
and
phantoms
of
the
restless
throng
began
to
chase
each
other
through
my
brain
the
exotic
costumes
of
the
albanian
girls
in
their
green
and
gold
wove
themselves
into
dreams
and
called
up
colours
seen
in
northern
africa
during
still
wilder
festivals
negro
festivals
such
as
loved
to
depict
in
spectral
dance
there
flitted
before
my
vision
nightmarish
throngs
of
dusky
women
bedizened
in
that
same
green
and
gold
arabs
i
saw
riding
tumultuously
hither
and
thither
with
burnous
flying
in
the
wind
beggars
crawling
about
the
hot
sand
and
howling
for
alms
ribbons
and
flags
flying
a
blaze
of
sunshine
overhead
and
on
earth
a
seething
orgy
of
colour
and
sound
methought
i
heard
the
guttural
yells
of
the
musketry
firing
braying
of
asses
the
demoniacal
groans
of
the
camels
was
it
really
a
camel
no
it
was
something
infinitely
worse
and
within
a
few
feet
of
my
ears
i
sprang
out
of
bed
there
at
the
very
window
stood
a
youth
extracting
unearthly
noises
out
of
the
basilicata
bagpipe
to
be
sure
i
remembered
expressing
an
interest
in
this
rare
instrument
to
one
of
my
hosts
who
with
subtle
delicacy
must
have
ordered
the
boy
to
give
me
a
taste
of
his
quality
to
perform
a
matutinal
serenade
for
my
especial
benefit
how
thoughtful
these
people
are
it
was
not
quite
with
some
regret
i
said
farewell
to
sleep
and
stumbled
out
of
doors
where
my
friends
of
yesterday
evening
were
already
up
and
doing
the
eating
the
dancing
the
bagpipes
they
were
all
in
violent
activity
under
the
sober
and
passionless
eye
of
morning
a
gorgeous
procession
took
place
about
midday
like
a
serpent
it
wound
out
of
the
chapel
writhed
through
the
intricacies
of
the
pathway
and
then
unrolled
itself
freely
in
splendid
convolutions
about
the
sunlit
meadow
saluted
by
the
crash
of
mortars
bursts
of
military
music
from
the
band
chanting
priests
and
women
and
all
the
bagpipers
congregated
in
a
mass
each
playing
his
own
favourite
tune
the
figure
of
the
madonna
a
modern
and
unprepossessing
image
was
carried
aloft
surrounded
by
resplendent
ecclesiastics
and
followed
by
a
picturesque
string
of
women
bearing
their
votive
offerings
of
candles
great
and
small
several
hundredweight
of
wax
must
have
been
brought
up
on
the
heads
of
pious
female
pilgrims
these
candles
are
arranged
in
charming
designs
they
are
fixed
upright
in
a
framework
of
wood
to
resemble
baskets
or
and
decked
with
bright
ribbons
and
paper
flowers
who
settles
the
expenses
of
such
a
festival
the
priests
in
the
first
place
have
paid
a
good
deal
to
make
it
attractive
they
have
improved
the
chapel
constructed
a
number
of
permanent
wooden
shelters
rain
sometimes
spoils
the
proceedings
as
well
as
a
capacious
reservoir
for
holding
drinking
water
which
has
to
be
transported
in
barrels
from
a
considerable
distance
then
as
to
the
immediate
outlay
for
music
fireworks
and
so
forth
the
is
put
up
to
auction
della
madonna
as
they
say
that
is
the
privilege
of
helping
to
carry
the
idol
from
the
church
and
back
in
the
procession
is
sold
to
the
highest
bidders
inasmuch
as
she
is
put
up
for
auction
several
times
during
this
short
perambulation
fresh
enthusiasts
coming
forward
gaily
with
and
shoulders
whole
villages
competing
against
each
other
a
good
deal
of
money
is
realized
in
this
way
there
are
also
spontaneous
gifts
of
money
goats
and
sheep
too
decorated
with
coloured
rags
are
led
up
by
peasants
who
have
devoted
them
to
the
mother
of
god
the
butchers
on
the
spot
buy
these
beasts
for
slaughter
and
their
price
goes
to
swell
the
funds
this
year
expenditure
may
have
been
a
thousand
francs
or
so
and
the
proceeds
are
calculated
at
about
of
that
sum
no
matter
if
the
priests
do
not
make
good
the
deficiency
some
one
else
will
be
kind
enough
to
step
forward
better
luck
next
year
the
festival
they
hope
is
to
become
more
popular
as
time
goes
on
despite
the
chilling
prophecy
of
one
of
our
friends
it
will
finish
this
comedy
the
money
by
the
way
does
not
pass
through
the
hands
of
the
clerics
but
of
two
individuals
called
regolatore
and
priore
who
mutually
control
each
other
they
are
men
of
reputable
families
who
burden
themselves
with
the
troublesome
task
for
the
honour
of
the
thing
and
make
up
any
deficiencies
in
the
accounts
out
of
their
own
pockets
cases
of
malversation
are
legendary
this
procession
marked
the
close
of
the
religious
gathering
hardly
was
it
over
before
there
began
a
frenzied
scrimmage
of
departure
and
soon
the
woodlands
echoed
with
the
laughter
and
farewellings
of
pilgrims
returning
homewards
by
divergent
paths
the
whole
way
through
the
forest
we
formed
part
of
a
jostling
caravan
along
the
track
how
different
from
the
last
time
i
had
traversed
this
route
when
nothing
broke
the
silence
save
a
chaffinch
piping
among
the
branches
or
the
distant
tap
of
some
woodpecker
so
ended
the
once
in
the
year
this
mountain
chapel
is
rudely
disquieted
in
its
slumbers
by
a
boisterous
riot
then
it
sinks
again
into
tranquil
oblivion
while
autumn
dyes
the
beeches
to
gold
and
very
soon
the
long
winter
comes
chill
tempests
shake
the
trees
and
leaves
are
scattered
to
earth
towards
yuletide
some
woodman
of
viggianello
adventuring
into
these
solitudes
and
mindful
of
their
green
summer
revels
discovers
his
familiar
sanctuary
entombed
up
to
the
under
a
glittering
sheet
of
snow
there
was
a
little
episode
in
the
late
afternoon
we
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
gaudolino
valley
and
begun
the
crossing
of
the
plain
when
there
met
us
a
woman
with
dishevelled
hair
weeping
bitterly
and
showing
other
signs
of
distress
one
would
have
thought
she
had
been
robbed
or
badly
hurt
not
at
all
like
the
rest
of
us
she
had
attended
the
feast
and
arriving
home
with
the
first
party
had
been
stopped
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
where
they
had
insisted
upon
fumigating
her
clothes
as
a
precaution
against
cholera
and
those
of
her
companions
that
was
all
but
the
indignity
choked
her
she
had
run
back
to
warn
the
rest
of
us
all
of
whom
were
to
be
treated
to
the
same
outrage
every
approach
to
morano
she
declared
was
watched
by
doctors
to
prevent
wary
pilgrims
from
entering
by
unsuspected
paths
during
her
recital
my
muleteer
had
grown
thoughtful
what
to
be
done
he
asked
i
do
much
mind
fumigation
i
replied
oh
but
i
do
i
mind
it
very
much
and
these
doctors
are
so
dreadfully
distrustful
how
shall
we
cheat
them
i
have
it
i
have
it
and
he
elaborated
the
following
stratagem
i
go
on
ahead
of
you
alone
leading
the
two
mules
you
follow
out
of
sight
behind
and
what
happens
when
i
reach
the
doctor
he
asks
slyly
and
how
did
you
enjoy
the
festival
this
year
then
i
say
this
year
doctor
alas
no
festival
for
me
i
been
with
an
englishman
collecting
beetles
in
the
forest
and
see
here
his
riding
mule
he
walks
on
behind
oh
quite
harmless
doctor
a
nice
gentleman
indeed
only
he
prefers
walking
he
really
it
ha
ha
ha
why
mention
about
my
walking
i
interrupted
the
was
still
a
sore
subject
i
mention
about
your
not
riding
he
explained
graciously
because
it
will
seem
to
the
doctor
a
sure
sign
that
you
are
a
little
here
he
touched
his
forehead
with
a
significant
gesture
a
little
like
some
other
foreigners
you
know
and
that
in
its
turn
will
account
for
your
collecting
beetles
and
that
in
its
turn
will
account
for
your
not
visiting
the
madonna
you
comprehend
the
argument
how
it
all
hangs
together
i
see
what
next
then
you
come
up
holding
one
beetle
in
each
hand
and
pretend
not
to
know
a
word
of
italian
not
a
word
you
must
smile
at
the
doctor
in
friendly
fashion
he
like
that
and
besides
it
will
prove
what
i
said
about
touching
his
forehead
once
more
in
fact
the
truth
will
be
manifest
and
there
will
be
no
fumigation
for
us
it
seemed
a
needlessly
circuitous
method
of
avoiding
such
a
slight
inconvenience
i
would
have
put
more
faith
in
a
truthful
narrative
by
myself
suffused
with
that
ingratiating
amiability
which
i
would
perforce
employ
on
such
occasions
but
the
stronger
mind
as
usual
had
its
way
i
smile
i
agreed
but
you
shall
carry
my
beetles
it
looks
more
natural
somehow
go
ahead
and
find
them
he
moved
forwards
with
the
beasts
and
after
destroying
a
considerable
tract
of
stone
wall
procured
a
few
specimens
of
native
coleoptera
which
he
carefully
wrapped
up
in
a
piece
of
paper
i
followed
slowly
unfortunately
for
him
that
particular
doctor
happened
to
be
an
a
snappy
little
fellow
lately
returned
from
the
states
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
sir
he
began
as
i
came
up
to
where
the
two
were
arguing
together
i
heard
of
your
passing
through
the
other
day
so
you
do
talk
italian
well
then
see
here
this
man
of
yours
this
son
of
satan
has
been
showing
me
a
couple
of
bugs
and
telling
me
a
couple
of
hundred
lies
about
them
better
move
on
right
away
lucky
you
struck
as
for
this
son
of
a
you
bet
sulphur
him
bugs
and
all
to
hell
i
paid
the
crestfallen
muleteer
then
and
there
took
down
my
bags
greatly
lightened
and
departed
with
them
glancing
round
near
the
little
bridge
i
saw
that
the
pair
were
still
engaged
in
heated
discussion
my
man
clinging
despairingly
as
it
seemed
to
the
he
looked
at
me
with
reproachful
eyes
as
though
i
had
deserted
him
in
his
hour
of
need
but
what
could
i
do
not
knowing
italian
moreover
i
remembered
the
fifteen
minutes
later
a
light
carriage
took
me
to
castrovillari
whence
after
a
bath
and
dinner
that
compensated
for
past
hardships
i
sped
down
to
the
station
and
managed
by
a
miracle
to
catch
the
to
cosenza
xxi
milton
in
calabria
you
may
spend
pleasant
days
in
this
city
of
cosenza
doing
nothing
whatever
but
i
go
there
a
for
set
purpose
and
bristling
with
energy
i
go
there
to
hunt
for
a
book
by
a
certain
salandra
which
was
printed
on
the
spot
and
which
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
find
although
i
once
discovered
it
in
an
old
catalogue
priced
at
gladly
would
i
give
for
it
the
author
was
a
contemporary
of
that
flying
monk
of
whom
i
spoke
in
chapter
x
and
he
belonged
to
the
same
religious
order
if
in
what
i
then
said
about
the
flying
monk
there
appears
to
be
some
trace
of
light
fooling
in
regard
to
this
order
and
its
methods
let
amends
be
made
by
what
i
have
to
tell
about
old
salandra
the
discovery
of
whose
book
is
one
of
primary
importance
for
the
history
of
english
letters
thus
i
thought
at
the
time
and
thus
i
still
think
with
all
due
deference
to
certain
grave
and
discerning
gentlemen
the
editors
of
various
english
monthlies
to
whom
i
submitted
a
paper
on
this
subject
a
paper
which
they
promptly
returned
with
thanks
no
that
is
not
quite
correct
one
of
them
has
kept
it
and
as
six
years
have
passed
over
our
heads
i
presume
he
has
now
acquired
a
title
by
adverse
possession
much
good
may
it
do
him
had
the
discovery
been
mine
i
should
have
endeavoured
to
hide
my
light
under
the
proverbial
bushel
but
it
is
not
mine
and
therefore
i
make
bold
to
say
that
bliss
perry
of
the
atlantic
monthly
knew
better
than
his
english
colleagues
when
he
published
the
article
from
which
i
take
what
follows
charles
dunster
on
milton
early
reading
traces
the
of
lost
to
sylvester
bartas
masenius
cedmon
vendei
and
other
older
writers
have
also
been
named
in
this
connection
while
the
majority
of
milton
english
commentators
and
among
foreigners
voltaire
and
tiraboschi
are
inclined
to
regard
the
exul
of
grotius
or
andreini
sacred
drama
of
as
the
prototype
this
latter
can
be
consulted
in
the
third
volume
of
cowper
the
matter
is
still
unsettled
and
in
view
of
the
number
of
recent
scholars
who
have
interested
themselves
in
it
one
is
really
surprised
that
no
notice
has
yet
been
taken
of
an
italian
article
which
goes
far
towards
deciding
this
question
and
proving
that
the
chief
source
of
lost
is
the
caduto
a
sacred
tragedy
by
serafino
della
salandra
the
merit
of
this
discovery
belongs
to
francesco
zicari
whose
paper
scoverta
dell
originale
italiano
da
cui
milton
trasse
il
suo
poema
del
paradiso
perduto
is
printed
on
pages
to
in
the
volume
of
the
naples
now
lying
before
me
it
is
in
the
form
of
a
letter
addressed
to
his
friend
francesco
ruffa
a
native
of
tropea
in
calabria
footnote
zicari
contemplated
another
paper
on
this
subject
but
i
am
unaware
whether
this
was
ever
published
the
neapolitan
who
wrote
his
storiche
in
speaks
of
this
article
as
having
been
already
printed
in
but
does
not
say
where
this
is
corroborated
by
falcone
della
calabria
naples
pp
who
gives
the
same
date
and
adds
that
zicari
was
the
author
of
a
work
on
the
district
of
fuscaldo
he
was
born
at
paola
in
calabria
of
which
he
wrote
a
manuscript
history
and
died
in
in
this
milton
article
he
speaks
of
his
name
being
in
the
republic
of
he
it
mentioned
by
nicola
leoni
della
magna
grecia
vol
ii
salandra
it
is
true
is
named
among
the
writers
of
sacred
tragedies
in
todd
vol
ii
and
also
by
hayley
but
neither
of
them
had
the
curiosity
or
the
opportunity
to
examine
his
caduto
hayley
expressly
says
that
he
has
not
seen
it
more
recent
works
such
as
that
of
moers
fontibus
paradisi
amissi
miltoniani
bonn
do
not
mention
salandra
at
all
byse
on
the
continent
merely
hints
at
some
possible
motives
for
the
allegro
and
the
penseroso
as
to
dates
there
can
be
no
doubt
to
whom
the
priority
belongs
the
of
salandra
was
printed
at
cosenza
in
richardson
thinks
that
milton
entered
upon
his
lost
in
and
that
it
was
shown
as
done
in
masson
agrees
with
this
adding
that
was
not
published
till
two
years
afterwards
the
date
is
fixed
i
presume
by
the
quaker
elwood
account
of
his
visit
to
milton
in
the
autumn
of
that
year
when
the
poet
gave
him
the
manuscript
to
read
the
two
years
delay
in
publication
may
possibly
have
been
due
to
the
confusion
occasioned
by
the
great
plague
and
fire
of
london
the
castigation
bestowed
upon
lauder
by
bishop
douglas
followed
as
it
was
by
a
terrific
from
the
brawny
arm
of
samuel
johnson
induces
me
to
say
that
salandra
caduto
though
extremely
rare
so
rare
that
neither
the
british
museum
nor
the
paris
bibliothèque
nationale
possesses
a
copy
is
an
imaginary
book
i
have
had
it
in
my
hands
and
examined
it
at
the
naples
biblioteca
nazionale
it
is
a
small
octavo
of
pages
not
including
twenty
unnumbered
ones
and
another
one
at
the
end
for
correction
of
misprints
badly
printed
and
bearing
all
the
marks
of
genuineness
with
the
author
name
and
the
year
and
place
of
publication
clearly
set
forth
on
the
i
have
carefully
compared
zicari
references
to
it
and
quotations
from
it
with
the
original
they
are
correct
save
for
a
few
insignificant
verbal
discrepancies
which
so
far
as
i
can
judge
betray
no
indication
of
an
attempt
on
his
part
to
mislead
the
reader
such
as
using
the
word
trumpet
instead
of
salandra
term
sackbut
and
if
further
proof
of
authenticity
be
required
i
may
note
that
the
caduto
of
salandra
is
already
cited
in
old
bibliographies
like
napoletana
or
that
of
joannes
a
antonio
universa
franciscana
madrid
vol
iii
it
appears
to
have
been
the
only
literary
production
of
its
author
who
was
a
franciscan
monk
and
is
described
as
lector
and
definitor
of
the
reformed
province
of
basilicata
we
may
take
it
then
that
salandra
was
a
real
person
who
published
a
mystery
called
caduto
in
and
i
will
now
without
further
preamble
extract
from
zicari
article
as
much
as
may
be
sufficient
to
show
ground
for
his
contention
that
milton
lost
is
a
transfusion
in
general
and
in
particular
of
this
same
mystery
salandra
central
theme
is
the
universe
shattered
by
the
disobedience
of
the
first
man
the
origin
of
our
unhappiness
and
sins
the
same
with
milton
salandra
chief
personages
are
god
and
his
angels
the
first
man
and
woman
the
serpent
satan
and
his
angels
the
same
with
milton
salandra
at
the
opening
of
his
poem
the
prologue
sets
forth
his
argument
and
dwells
upon
the
creative
omnipotence
and
his
works
the
same
with
milton
salandra
then
describes
the
council
of
the
rebel
angels
their
fall
from
heaven
into
a
desert
and
sulphurous
region
their
discourses
man
is
enviously
spoken
of
and
his
fall
by
means
of
stratagem
decided
upon
it
is
resolved
to
reunite
in
council
in
pandemonium
or
the
abyss
where
measures
may
be
adopted
to
the
end
that
man
may
become
the
enemy
of
god
and
the
prey
of
hell
the
same
with
milton
salandra
personifies
sin
and
death
the
latter
being
the
child
of
the
former
the
same
with
milton
salandra
describes
omnipotence
foreseeing
the
effects
of
the
temptation
and
fall
of
man
and
preparing
his
redemption
the
same
with
milton
salandra
depicts
the
site
of
paradise
and
the
happy
life
there
the
same
with
milton
salandra
sets
forth
the
miraculous
creation
of
the
universe
and
of
man
and
the
virtues
of
the
forbidden
fruit
the
same
with
milton
salandra
reports
the
conversation
between
eve
and
the
serpent
the
eating
of
the
forbidden
fruit
and
the
despair
of
our
first
parents
the
same
with
milton
salandra
describes
the
joy
of
death
at
the
discomfiture
of
eve
the
rejoicings
in
hell
the
grief
of
adam
the
flight
of
our
first
parents
their
shame
and
repentance
the
same
with
milton
salandra
anticipates
the
intercession
of
the
redeemer
and
the
overthrow
of
sin
and
death
he
dwells
upon
the
wonders
of
the
creation
the
murder
of
abel
by
his
brother
cain
and
other
human
ills
the
vices
of
the
antediluvians
due
to
the
fall
of
adam
the
infernal
gift
of
war
the
same
with
milton
salandra
describes
the
passion
of
jesus
christ
and
the
comforts
which
adam
and
eve
receive
from
the
angel
who
announces
the
coming
of
the
messiah
lastly
their
departure
from
the
earthly
paradise
the
same
with
milton
so
much
for
the
general
scheme
of
both
poems
and
now
for
a
few
particular
points
of
resemblance
verbal
and
otherwise
the
character
of
milton
satan
with
the
various
facets
of
pride
envy
vindictiveness
despair
and
impenitence
which
go
to
form
that
harmonious
whole
are
already
clearly
mapped
out
in
the
lucifero
of
salandra
for
this
statement
which
i
find
correct
zicari
gives
chapter
and
verse
but
it
would
take
far
too
long
to
set
forth
the
matter
in
this
place
the
speeches
of
lucifero
to
be
sure
read
rather
like
a
caricature
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
salandra
was
writing
for
theatrical
spectators
and
not
for
refined
readers
but
the
elements
which
milton
has
utilized
are
already
there
here
is
a
coincidence
here
we
may
reign
secure
better
to
reign
in
hell
than
serve
in
heaven
milton
i
qui

prence
salandra
and
another
whom
shall
we
find
sufficient
this
enterprise
none
shall
partake
with
me
milton
ii
a
chi
basterà
l
anima
di
voi
certo
che
quest
affare
a
la
mia
man

aspetta
salandra
milton
terror
is
partially
taken
from
the
megera
of
the
italian
poet
the
terror
threatens
satan
ii
and
the
office
of
megera
in
salandra
drama
is
exactly
the
same
that
is
to
threaten
and
chastise
the
rebellious
spirit
which
she
does
very
effectually
pages
the
identical
monsters
cerberus
hydras
and
chimseras
are
found
in
their
respective
abodes
but
salandra
does
not
content
himself
with
these
three
his
list
includes
such
a
mixed
assemblage
of
creatures
as
owls
basilisks
dragons
tigers
bears
crocodiles
sphynxes
harpies
and
panthers
terror
moves
with
dread
rapidity
and
from
his
seat
the
monster
moving
onward
came
as
fast
with
horrid
strides
milton
ii
and
so
does
megera
in
atterir
in
spaventar
son
rapido
si
ch
ogni
ripar
è
vano
salandra
both
milton
and
salandra
use
the
names
of
the
gods
of
antiquity
for
their
demons
but
the
narrative
epic
of
the
english
poet
naturally
permitted
of
far
greater
prolixity
and
variety
in
this
respect
a
most
curious
parallelism
exists
between
milton
belial
and
that
of
salandra
both
are
described
as
luxurious
timorous
slothful
and
scoffing
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
milton
has
taken
over
these
mixed
attributes
from
the
italian
footnote
this
is
one
of
the
occasions
in
which
zicari
appears
at
first
sight
to
have
stretched
a
point
in
order
to
improve
his
case
because
in
the
reference
he
gives
it
is
behemoth
and
not
belial
who
speaks
of
himielf
as
cowardly
imbelle
but
in
another
place
lucifer
applies
this
designation
to
belial
as
well
the
words
of
milton
beelzebub
ii
seduce
them
to
our
party
that
their
god
may
prove
their
foe
are
copied
from
those
of
the
italian
lucifero
facciam
acciò
che
l
huom
divenga
a
dio
nemico
regarding
the
creation
of
the
world
salandra
asks
qual
lingua
può
di
dio
benché
da
dio
formato
lodar
di
dio
le
meraviglie
estreme
which
is
thus
echoed
by
milton
vii
to
recount
almighty
works
what
words
or
tongue
of
seraph
can
suffice
there
is
a
considerable
resemblance
between
the
two
poets
in
their
descriptions
of
paradise
and
of
its
joys
in
both
poems
too
adam
warns
his
spouse
of
her
frailty
and
in
the
episode
of
eve
meeting
with
the
serpent
there
are
no
less
than
four
verbal
coincidences
thus
salandra
writes
ravviso
gli
animal
ch
a
schiera
a
schiera
già
fanno
humil
e
inclino
ravveggio
il
bel
serpente
in
giri
o
sei
bello
con
tanta
varietà
che
certo
sembri
altro
stellato
ciel
terra
o
che
sento
parli
and
milton
transcribes
it
as
follows
ix
she
minded
not
as
used
to
such
disport
before
her
through
the
field
from
every
beast
more
at
her
call
curled
many
a
wanton
in
sight
of
eve
his
turret
crest
and
sleek
neck
what
may
this
mean
language
of
man
by
tongue
of
brute
altogether
zicari
has
observed
that
rolli
although
unacquainted
with
the
caduto
has
sometimes
inadvertently
hit
upon
the
same
words
in
his
italian
translation
of
milton
which
salandra
had
used
before
him
eve
altered
complexion
after
the
eating
of
the
forbidden
fruit
is
noted
by
both
poets
torbata
ne

contenta
salandra
thus
eve
with
countenance
blithe
her
story
told
but
in
her
cheek
distemper
flushing
glowed
milton
ix
only
with
this
difference
that
the
italian
eve
adds
a
by
way
of
explaining
the
change
forse

it
is
not
to
my
purpose
to
do

work
over

as
this

entail
a

nearly

can

will
therefore
refer
to
the
originals
those
who
wish
to
go
into
the
subject
more
fully
warning
them
passant
that
they
may
find
the
task
of
verification
more
troublesome
than
it
seems
owing
to
a
stupid
mistake
on
zicari
part
for
in
his
references
to
milton
he
claims
to
use
an
venice
translation
of
the
by
rolli
now
rolli
perduto
is
a
work
which
was
issued
in
many
editions
in
london
paris
and
italy
throughout
the
eighteenth
century
but
i
can
not
trace
this
particular
one
of
venice
and
application
to
many
of
the
chief
libraries
of
italy
has
convinced
me
that
it
does
not
exist
and
that
must
be
a
misprint
for
some
other
year
the
error
would
be
of
no
significance
if
zicari
had
referred
to
rolli
by
the
usual
system
of
cantos
and
lines
but
he
refers
to
it
by
pages
and
the
pagination
differs
in
every
one
of
the
editions
of
rolli
which
have
passed
through
my
hands
despite
every
effort
i
have
not
been
able
to
hit
upon
the
precise
one
which
zicari
had
in
mind
and
if
future
students
are
equally
unfortunate
i
wish
them
joy
of
their
labours
footnote
let
me
take
this
opportunity
of
expressing
my
best
thanks
to
baron
tortora
brayda
of
the
naples
biblioteca
nazionale
who
has
taken
an
infinity
of
trouble
in
this
matter
these
few
extracts
however
will
suffice
to
show
that
without
salandra
the
lost
as
we
know
it
would
not
be
in
existence
and
that
zicari
discovery
is
therefore
one
of
primary
importance
for
english
letters
although
it
would
be
easy
to
point
out
divergencies
between
the
two
works
divergencies
often
due
to
the
varying
tastes
and
feelings
of
a
republican
englishman
and
an
italian
catholic
and
to
the
different
conditions
imposed
by
an
epic
and
a
dramatic
poem
thus
in
regard
to
this
last
point
zicari
has
already
noted
that
salandra
scenic
acts
were
necessarily
reproduced
in
the
form
by
milton
who
could
not
avail
himself
of
the
mechanism
of
the
drama
for
this
purpose
milton
was
a
man
of
the
world
traveller
scholar
and
politician
but
it
will
not
do
for
us
to
insist
too
vehemently
upon
the
probable
mental
inferiority
of
the
calabrian
monk
in
view
of
the
high
opinion
which
milton
seems
to
have
had
of
his
talents
imitation
is
the
sincerest
form
of
flattery
the
caduto
of
course
is
only
one
of
a
series
of
similar
works
concerning
which
a
large
literature
has
now
grown
up
and
it
might
not
be
difficult
to
prove
that
salandra
was
indebted
to
some
previous
writer
for
those
words
and
phrases
which
he
passed
on
to
the
english
poet
but
where
did
milton
become
acquainted
with
this
tragedy
it
was
at
naples
according
to
cowper
vol
iii
that
the
english
poet
may
first
have
entertained
the
idea
of
loss
of
paradise
as
a
subject
peculiarly
fit
for
poetry
he
may
well
have
discussed
sacred
tragedies
like
those
of
andreini
with
the
marquis
manso
but
milton
had
returned
to
england
long
before
salandra
poem
was
printed
nor
can
manso
have
sent
him
a
copy
of
it
for
he
died
in
two
years
before
its
publication
and
zicari
is
thus
mistaken
in
assuming
that
milton
became
acquainted
with
it
in
the
house
of
the
neapolitan
nobleman
unless
therefore
we
take
for
granted
that
manso
was
intimate
with
the
author
salandra
he
knew
most
of
his
literary
countrymen
and
sent
or
gave
to
milton
a
copy
of
the
manuscript
of
before
it
was
printed
or
that
milton
was
personally
familiar
with
salandra
we
may
conclude
that
the
poem
was
forwarded
to
him
from
italy
by
some
other
friend
perhaps
by
some
member
of
the
degli
which
manso
had
founded
a
chance
therefore
seems
to
have
decided
milton
salandra
tragedy
fell
into
his
hands
and
was
welded
into
the
epic
form
which
he
had
designed
for
arthur
the
great
even
as
in
later
years
a
chance
question
on
the
part
of
elwood
led
to
his
writing
regained
footnote
hast

of

but
what
hast

he
made
no
answer
but
sat
some
time
in
a
muse
for
this
poem
there
were
not
so
many
models
handy
as
for
the
other
but
milton
has
written
too
little
to
enable
us
to
decide
how
far
its
inferiority
to
the
earlier
epic
is
due
to
this
fact
and
how
far
to
the
inherent
inertia
of
its
little
movement
can
be
contrived
in
a
mere
dialogue
such
as
regained
it
lacks
the
grandiose
and
the
shifting
splendours
of
the
greater
epic
the
stupendous
figure
of
the
rebellious
archangel
the
true
hero
of
lost
is
here
dwarfed
into
a
puny
malignant
sophist
nor
is
the
final
issue
in
the
later
poem
for
a
in
doubt
a
serious
defect

an
artistic
point
of
view

set
off
in
the
most
specious
manner
and
refuted
by
the
son
of
god
with
strong
unaffected
eloquence
merits
for
which
milton
needed
no
original
of
any
kind
as
his
own
lofty
religious
sentiments
his
argumentative
talents
and
long
experience
of
political
pamphleteering
stood
him
in
good
stead
most
of
us
must
have
wondered
how
it
came
about
that
milton
could
not
endure
to
hear
lost
preferred
to
regained
in
view
of
the
very
apparent
inferiority
of
the
latter
if
we
had
known
what
milton
knew
namely
to
how
large
an
extent
lost
was
not
the
child
of
his
own
imagination
and
therefore
not
so
precious
in
his
eyes
as
regained
we
might
have
understood
his
prejudice
certain
parts
of
lost
are
drawn
as
we
all
know
from
other
italian
sources
from
sannazario
ariosto
guarini
bojardo
and
others
zicari
who
it
must
be
said
has
made
the
best
of
his
case
will
have
it
that
the
musterings
and
battles
of
the
good
and
evil
angels
are
copied
from
the
of
valvasone
published
at
milan
in
but
polidori
who
has
reprinted
the
in
his
italian
version
of
milton
london
has
gone
into
this
matter
and
thinks
otherwise
these
combats
were
a
popular
theme
at
the
time
and
there
is
no
reason
why
the
english
poet
should
copy
continental
writers
in
such
descriptions
which
necessarily
have
a
common
resemblance
the
marquis
manso
was
very
friendly
with
the
poets
tasso
and
marino
and
it
is
also
to
be
remarked
that
entire
passages
in
lost
are
copied
verbis
from
the
writings
of
these
two
manso
having
no
doubt
drawn
milton
attention
to
their
beauties
in
fact
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
manso
notorious
enthusiasm
for
the
epic
of
tasso
may
first
of
all
have
diverted
milton
from
purely
pastoral
ideals
and
inflamed
him
with
the
desire
of
accomplishing
a
similar
feat
whence
the
lines
in
milton
latin
verses
to
this
friend
which
contain
the
first
indication
of
such
a
design
on
his
part
even
the
familiar
invocation
wedded
love
is
bodily
drawn
from
one
of
tasso
letters
see
newton
vol
i
pp
it
has
been
customary
to
speak
of
these
literary
appropriations
as
but
whoever
compares
them
with
the
originals
will
find
that
many
of
them
are
more
correctly
termed
translations
the
case
from
a
point
of
view
is
different
as
regards
ancient
writers
and
it
is
surely
idle
to
accuse
milton
as
has
been
done
of
pilferings
from
aeschylus
or
ovid
there
is
no
such
thing
as
robbing
the
classics
they
are
our
literary
fathers
and
what
they
have
left
behind
them
is
our
common
heritage
we
may
adapt
borrow
or
steal
from
them
as
much
as
will
suit
our
purpose
to
acknowledge
such
is
sheer
pedantry
and
ostentation
but
salandra
and
the
rest
of
them
were
contemporaries
it
is
certainly
an
astonishing
fact
that
no
scholar
of
the
stamp
of
thyer
was
acquainted
with
the
caduto
and
it
says
much
for
the
isolation
of
england
that
at
a
period
when
poems
on
the
subject
of
paradise
lost
were
being
scattered
broadcast
in
italy
and
elsewhere
when
in
short
all
europe
was
ringing
with
the
doleful
history
of
adam
and
eve
milton
could
have
ventured
to
speak
of
his
work
as
unattempted
yet
in
prose
or
rhyma
an
amazing
verse
which
by
the
way
is
literally
transcribed
out
of
ariosto
non
detta
in
prosa
mai
né
in
rima
but
even
now
the
acquaintance
of
the
british
public
with
the
productions
of
continental
writers
is
superficial
and
spasmodic
and
such
was
the
ignorance
of
english
scholars
of
this
earlier
period
that
birch
maintained
that
milton
drafts
to
be
referred
to
presently
indicated
his
intention
of
writing
an
while
as
late
as
the
poet
mickle
notwithstanding
voltaire
authority
questioned
the
very
existence
of
andreini
who
has
written
thirty
different
pieces
some
idea
of
the
time
when
salandra
tragedy
reached
milton
might
be
gained
if
we
knew
the
date
of
his
manuscript
projects
for
lost
and
other
writings
which
are
preserved
at
cambridge
garnett
of
milton
supposes
these
drafts
to
date
from
about
to
and
i
am
not
sufficiently
learned
in
miltonian
lore
to
controvert
or
corroborate
in
a
general
way
this
assertion
but
the
date
must
presumably
be
pushed
further
forward
in
the
case
of
the
skeletons
for
lost
which
are
modelled
to
a
great
extent
upon
salandra
of
though
other
compositions
may
also
have
been
present
before
milton
mind
such
as
that
mentioned
on
page
of
the
second
volume
of
todd
from
which
he
seems
to
have
drawn
the
hint
of
a
spoken
by
moses
without
going
into
the
matter
exhaustively
i
will
only
say
that
from
these
pieces
it
is
clear
that
milton
primary
idea
was
to
write
like
salandra
a
sacred
tragedy
upon
this
theme
and
not
an
epic
these
drafts
also
contain
a
chorus
such
as
salandra
has
placed
in
his
drama
and
a
great
number
of
mutes
who
do
not
figure
in
the
english
epic
but
who
reappear
in
the
caduto
and
all
similar
works
even
satan
is
here
designated
as
lucifer
in
accordance
with
the
italian
lucifero
and
at
the
end
of
one
of
milton
drafts
we
read
last
appears
mercy
comforts
him
promises
the
messiah
which
is
exactly
what
salandra
misericordia
mercy
does
in
the
same
place
milton
no
doubt
kept
on
hand
many
loose
passages
of
poetry
both
original
and
borrowed
ready
to
be
worked
up
into
larger
pieces
all
poets
are
smothered
in
odd
scraps
of
verse
and
lore
which
they
as
occasion
requires
and
it
is
therefore
quite
possible
that
some
fragments
now
included
in
lost
may
have
been
complete
before
the
caduto
was
printed
i
am
referring
more
especially
to
satan
address
to
the
sun
which
philips
says
was
written
before
the
commencement
of
the
epic
admitting
philips
to
be
correct
i
still
question
whether
this
invocation
was
composed
before
milton
visit
to
naples
and
if
it
was
the
poet
may
well
have
intended
it
for
some
other
of
the
multitudinous
works
which
these
drafts
show
him
to
have
been
revolving
in
his
mind
or
for
none
of
them
in
particular
de
quincey
rightly
says
that
addison
gave
the
initial
bias
in
favour
of
lost
to
the
english
national
mind
which
has
thenceforward
shrunk
as
addison
himself
did
from
a
dispassionate
contemplation
of
its
defects
the
idea
being
i
presume
that
a
poem
in
a
manner
disarmed
rational
criticism
and
strange
to
say
even
the
few
faults
which
earlier
scholars
did
venture
to
point
out
in
milton
poem
will
be
found
in
that
of
salandra
there
is
the
same
superabundance
of
allegory
the
same
confusion
of
spirit
and
matter
among
the
supernatural
persons
the
same
lengthy
astronomical
treatise
the
same
personification
of
sin
and
death
the
same
medley
of
christian
and
pagan
mythology
the
same
tedious
disquisition
at
the
end
of
both
poems
for
the
rest
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
we
have
outgrown
our
fastidiousness
on
some
of
these
points
theological
fervour
has
abated
and
in
a
work
of
the
pure
imagination
as
lost
is
now
is
it
not
considered
to
be
there
is
nothing
incongruous
or
offensive
in
an
amiable
commingling
of
semitic
and
hellenic
deities
after
the
approved
italian
recipe
nor
do
a
few
long
words
about
geography
or
science
disquiet
us
any
more
milton
was
not
writing
for
an
uncivilized
mob
and
his
occasional
displays
of
erudition
will
represent
to
a
cultured
person
only
those
breathing
spaces
so
refreshing
in
all
epic
poetry
that
milton
language
is
saturated
with
latinisms
and
italianisms
is
perfectly
true
his
english
may
not
have
been
good
enough
for
his
contemporaries
but
it
is
quite
good
enough
for
us
that
which
matthew
arnold
claimed
for
milton
that
sustained
pitch
of
kingly
elaboration
and
fullness
is
not
wholly
an
affair
of
high
moral
tone
it
results
in
part
from
the
humbler
ministrations
of
words
happily
chosen
from
a
felicitous
alloy
of
mediterranean
grace
and
saxon
mettle
for
whether
consciously
or
not
we
can
not
but
be
influenced
by
the
of
mere
words
that
arouse
in
us
definite
but
indefinable
moods
of
mind
to
complain
of
the
foreign
phraseology
and
turns
of
thought
in
lost
would
be
the
blackest
ingratitude
nowadays
seeing
that
our
language
has
become
enriched
by
steady
gleams
of
pomp
and
splendour
due
in
large

to
the

he
pointed
out
the
church
of
spezzano
on
its
hilltop
a
proud
structure
it
looked
at
this
distance
though
nearer
acquaintance
reduced
it
to
extremely
humble
proportions
the
albanian
spezzano
spezzano
grande
is
another
place
lies
on
the
main
road
from
castrovillari
to
cosenza
on
the
summit
of
a
tongue
of
limestone
which
separates
the
crati
river
from
the
esaro
this
latter
after
flowing
into
the
coscile
joins
its
waters
with
the
crati
and
so
closes
the
promontory
an
odd
geographical
feature
this
low
stretch
viewed
from
the
greater
heights
of
sila
or
pollino
one
feels
inclined
to
take
a
broom
and
sweep
it
into
the
sea
so
that
the
waters
may
mingle
sooner
our
road
ascended
the
thousand
feet
in
a
sinuous
ribbon
of
white
dust
and
an
eternity
seemed
to
pass
as
we
crawled
drowsily
upwards
to
the
music
of
the
cicadas
under
the
simmering
blue
sky
there
was
not
a
soul
in
sight
a
hush
had
fallen
upon
all
things
great
pan
was
brooding
over
the
earth
at
last
we
entered
the
village
and
here
once
more
deathlike
stillness
reigned
it
was
the
hour
of
slumber
at
our
knocking
the
proprietor
of
the
inn
situated
in
a
descended
but
he
was
in
bad
humour
and
held
out
no
hopes
of
refreshment
certain
doctors
and
government
officials
he
said
were
gathered
together
in
his
house
telegraphically
summoned
to
consult
about
a
local
case
of
cholera
as
to
edibles
the
gentlemen
had
lunched
and
nothing
was
left
absolutely
nothing
it
had
been
sterminio
extermination
of
all
he
possessed
the
prospect
of
walking
about
the
burning
streets
till
evening
did
not
appeal
to
me
and
as
this
was
the
only
inn
at
spezzano
i
insisted
first
gently
then
forcibly
in
vain
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
chair
to
sit
upon
he
avowed
and
therewith
retired
into
his
cool
twilight
despairing
i
entered
a
small
shop
wherein
i
had
observed
the
only
signs
of
life
so
far
an
albanian
woman
spinning
in
patriarchal
fashion
it
was
a
room
stocked
with
candles
seeds
and
other
commodities
which
a
humble
householder
might
desire
to
purchase
including
certain
of
those
of
corigliano
ware
in
whose
shapely
contours
something
of
the
artistic
dreamings
of
old
sybaris
still
seems
to
linger
the
proprietress
clothed
in
gaudily
picturesque
costume
greeted
me
with
a
smile
and
the
easy
familiarity
which
i
have
since
discovered
to
be
natural
to
all
these
women
she
had
a
room
she
said
where
i
could
rest
there
was
also
food
such
as
it
was
cheese
and
wine
and
fruit
i
queried
ah
you
like
fruit
well
we
may
not
so
much
as
speak
about
it
just
now
the
cholera
the
doctors
the
policeman
the
prison
i
was
going
to
say
salami
i
thanked
her
i
know
calabrian
pigs
and
what
they
feed
on
though
it
would
be
hard
to
describe
in
the
language
of
polite
society
despite
the
heat
and
the
swarms
of
flies
in
that
chamber
i
felt
little
desire
for
repose
after
her
simple
repast
the
dame
was
so
affable
and
entertaining
that
we
soon
became
great
friends
i
caused
her
some
amusement
by
my
efforts
to
understand
and
pronounce
her
language
these
folk
speak
albanian
and
italian
with
equal
facility
which
seemed
to
my
unpractised
ears
as
hopeless
as
finnish
very
patiently
she
gave
me
a
long
lesson
during
which
i
thought
to
pick
up
a
few
words
and
phrases
but
the
upshot
of
it
all
was
you
never
learn
it
you
have
begun
a
hundred
years
too
late
i
tried
her
with
modern
greek
but
among
such
fragments
as
remained
on
my
tongue
after
a
lapse
of
over
twenty
years
only
hit
upon
one
word
that
she
could
understand
quite
right
she
said
encouragingly
why
do
you
always
speak
properly
and
now
let
me
hear
a
little
of
your
own
language
i
gave
utterance
to
a
few
verses
of
shakespeare
which
caused
considerable
merriment
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
she
asked
that
people
really
talk
like
that
of
course
they
do
and
pretend
to
understand
what
it
means
why
naturally
maybe
they
do
she
agreed
but
only
when
they
want
to
be
thought
funny
by
their
friends
the
afternoon
drew
on
apace
and
at
last
the
pitiless
sun
sank
to
rest
i
perambulated
spezzano
in
the
gathering
twilight
it
was
now
fairly
alive
with
people
an
unclean
place
an
epidemic
of
cholera
would
work
wonders
here
at
the
venerable
coachman
presented
himself
by
appointment
he
was
to
drive
me
slowly
out
of
respect
for
his
horse
through
the
cool
hours
of
the
night
as
far
as
vaccarizza
on
the
slopes
of
the
greek
sila
where
he
expected
to
arrive
early
in
the
morning
and
so
he
did
at
five
not
without
more
mirth
was
my
from
the
good
shopwoman
something
apparently
was
hopelessly
wrong
with
the
albanian
words
of
farewell
which
i
had
carefully
memorized
from
our
preceding
lesson
she
then
pressed
a
paper
parcel
into
my
hand
for
the
love
of
god
she
whispered
silence
or
we
shall
all
be
in
jail
it
contained
a
dozen
pears
driving
along
i
tried
to
enter
into
conversation
with
the
coachman
who
judging
by
his
face
was
a
mine
of
local
lore
but
i
had
come
too
late
the
poor
old
man
was
so
weakened
by
age
and
infirmities
that
he
cared
little
for
talk
his
thoughts
dwelling
as
i
charitably
imagined
on
his
wife
and
children
all
dead
and
buried
so
he
said
many
long
years
ago
he
mentioned
however
the
the
deluge
which
i
have
heard
spoken
of
by
older
people
among
whom
it
is
a
fixed
article
of
faith
this
deluge
is
supposed
to
have
affected
the
whole
crati
valley
submerging
towns
and
villages
in
proof
they
say
that
if
you
dig
near
tarsia
below
the
present
you
will
pass
through
beds
of
silt
and
ooze
to
traces
of
old
walls
and
cultivated
land
tarsia
used
to
lie
by
the
and
was
a
flourishing
place
according
to
the
descriptions
of
leandro
alberti
and
other
early
writers
floods
and
malaria
have
now
forced
it
to
climb
the
hills
the
current
of
the
crati
is
more
spasmodic
and
destructive
than
in
classical
times
when
the
river
was
navigable
and
to
one
of
its
inundations
may
be
due
this
legend
of
the
deluge
to
the
same
one
maybe
that
affected
the
courses
of
this
river
and
the
coscile
mingling
their
waters
which
used
to
flow
separately
into
the
ionian
or
it
may
be
a
hazy
memory
of
the
artificial
changing
of
the
riverbed
when
the
town
of
sybaris
lying
between
these
two
rivers
was
destroyed
yet
the
streams
are
depicted
as
entering
the
sea
apart
in
old
maps
such
as
those
of
magini
fiore
coronelli
and
cluver
and
the
latter
writes
that
near
the
mouth
of
the
crati
there
flows
into
the
same
sea
a
river
vulgarly
called
cochile
footnote
in
the
earlier
part
of
rathgeber
astonishing
grossgriechenland
und
pythagoras
will
be
found
a
good
list
of
old
maps
of
the
country
this
is
important
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
this
statement
is
the
result
of
a
personal
visit
or
whether
he
simply
repeated
the
old
geography
his
text
in
many
places
indicates
a
personal
acquaintance
with
southern
italy
says
heinsius
semel
peragravit
and
he
may
well
have
been
tempted
to
investigate
a
site
like
that
of
sybaris
if
so
the
change
in
the
river
courses
and
possibly
this
deluge
has
taken
place
since
his
day
deprived
of
converse
i
relapsed
into
a
doze
but
soon
woke
up
with
a
start
the
carriage
had
stopped
it
was
nearly
midnight
we
were
at
terranova
di
sibari
whose
houses
were
lit
up
by
the
silvery
beams
of
the
moon
thurii
of
herodotus
how
one
would
like
to
see
this
place
by
daylight
on
the
ancient
site
which
lies
at
a
considerable
distance
they
have
excavated
antiquities
a
large
number
of
which
are
in
the
possession
of
the
marchese
galli
at
castrovillari
i
endeavoured
to
see
his
museum
but
found
it
inaccessible
for
family
reasons
the
same
answer
was
given
me
in
regard
to
a
valuable
private
library
at
rossano
and
annoying
as
it
may
be
one
can
not
severely
blame
such
local
gentlemen
for
keeping
their
collections
to
themselves
what
have
they
to
gain
from
the
visits
of
inquisitive
travellers
during
these
meditations
on
my
part
the
old
man
hobbled
busily
to
and
fro
with
a
bucket
bearing
water
from
a
fountain
near
at
hand
wherewith
to
splash
the
he
persisted
in
this
singular
occupation
for
an
unreasonably
long
time
water
was
good
for
the
wheels
he
explained
it
kept
them
cool
at
last
we
started
and
i
began
to
slumber
once
more
the
carriage
seemed
to
be
going
down
a
steep
incline
endlessly
it
descended
with
a
pleasant
swaying
motion
then
an
icy
shiver
roused
me
from
my
dreams
it
was
the
crati
whose
rapid
waves
fraught
with
unhealthy
chills
rippled
brightly
in
the
moonlight
we
crossed
the
malarious
valley
and
once
more
touched
the
hills
from
those
treeless
slopes
there
streamed
forth
deliciously
warm
emanations
stored
up
during
the
scorching
hours
of
noon
the
short
scrub
that
clothed
them
was
redolent
of
that
peculiar
calabrian
odour
which
haunts
one
like
a
melody
an
odour
of
dried
cistus
and
other
aromatic
plants
balsamic
by
day
almost
overpowering
at
this
hour
to
aid
and
diversify
the
symphony
of
perfume
i
lit
a
cigar
and
then
gave
myself
up
to
contemplation
of
the
heavenly
bodies
we
passed
a
solitary
man
walking
swiftly
with
bowed
head
what
was
he
doing
there
lupomanaro
said
the
driver
a
werewolf
i
had
always
hoped
to
meet
with
a
werewolf
on
his
nocturnal
rambles
and
now
my
wish
was
gratified
but
it
was
disappointing
to
see
him
in
human
garb
even
werewolves
it
seems
must
march
with
the
times
this
enigmatical
growth
of
the
human
mind
flourishes
in
calabria
but
is
not
popular
as
a
subject
of
conversation
the
more
werewolves
cling
to
the
true
habits
and
in
that
case
only
the
pigs
the
inane
calabrian
pigs
are
dowered
with
the
faculty
of
distinguishing
them
in
daytime
when
they
look
like
any
other
christian
there
is
a
record
in
fiore
book
of
an
epidemic
of
lycanthropy
that
attacked
the
boys
of
cassano
why
only
the
boys
it
began
on
july
and
the
season
of
the
year
strikes
me
as
significant
after
that
i
fell
asleep
in
good
earnest
nor
did
i
wake
up
again
till
the
sun
was
peering
over
the
eastern
hills
we
were
climbing
up
a
long
slope
the
albanian
settlements
of
vaccarizza
and
san
giorgio
lay
before
us
and
looking
back
i
still
saw
spezzano
on
its
ridge
it
seemed
so
close
that
a
gunshot
could
have
reached
it
these
villages
date
from
the
centuries
that
followed
the
death
of
scanderbeg
when
the
grand
signior
consolidated
his
power
the
refugees
arrived
in
flocks
from
over
the
sea
and
were
granted
tracts
of
wild
land
whereon
to
settle
some
of
them
on
this
incline
of
the
sila
which
was
accordingly
called
greek
sila
the
native
confusing
these
foreigners
with
the
byzantines
whose
dwellings
as
regards
calabria
are
now
almost
exclusively
confined
to
the
distant
region
of
aspromonte
colonies
of
albanians
are
scattered
all
over
south
italy
chiefly
in
apulia
calabria
basilicata
and
sicily
a
few
are
in
the
north
and
centre
there
is
one
on
the
po
for
instance
now
reduced
to
inhabitants
most
of
these
latter
have
become
absorbed
into
the
surrounding
italian
element
angelo
masci
reprinted
says
there
are
villages
of
them
containing
altogether
inhabitants
exclusive
of
sicily
morelli
gives
their
total
population
for
italy
and
sicily
as
if
these
figures
are
correct
the
race
must
have
multiplied
latterly
for
i
am
told
there
are
now
some
albanians
in
the
kingdom
living
in
about
villages
this
gives
approximately
for
each
settlement
a
likely
number
if
it
includes
those
who
are
at
present
emigrants
in
america
there
is
a
voluminous
literature
on
the
subject
of
these
strangers
the
authors
of
which
are
nearly
all
albanians
themselves
the
fullest
account
of
older
conditions
may
well
be
that
contained
in
the
third
volume
of
learned
work
the
ponderous
francesco
tajani
brings
affairs
up
to
date
or
nearly
so
if
only
he
had
provided
his
book
with
an
index
there
were
troubles
at
first
arriving
as
they
did
solely
with
their
shirts
and
rhapsodies
so
one
of
them
described
it
to
me
that
is
despoiled
of
everything
they
indulged
in
robberies
and
depredations
somewhat
too
freely
even
for
those
free
days
with
the
result
that
ferocious
edicts
were
issued
against
them
and
whole
clans
wiped
out
it
was
a
case
of
necessity
knowing
no
law
but
in
proportion
as
the
forests
were
hewn
down
and
crops
sown
they
became
as
respectable
as
their
hosts
they
are
bilingual
from
birth
one
might
almost
say
and
numbers
of
the
men
also
express
themselves
correctly
in
english
which
they
pick
up
in
the
united
states
these
islands
of
alien
culture
have
been
hotbeds
of
liberalism
throughout
history
the
bourbons
persecuted
them
savagely
on
that
account
exiling
and
hanging
the
people
by
scores
at
this
moment
there
is
a
good
deal
of
excitement
going
on
in
favour
of
the
albanian
revolt
beyond
the
adriatic
and
it
was
proposed
among
other
things
to
organize
a
demonstration
in
rome
where
certain
roman
ladies
were
to
dress
themselves
in
albanian
costumes
and
thus
work
upon
the
sentiments
of
the
nation
but
the
authorities
forbade
this
and
every
other
movement
none
the
less
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
clandestine
recruiting
and
bitter
recriminations
against
this
turcophile
attitude
on
the
part
of
italy
this
reactionary
rigorism
against
every
manifestation
of
sympathy
for
the
albanian
cause
patriotic
pamphleteers
ask
rightly
enough
why
difficulties
should
be
placed
in
the
way
of
recruiting
for
albania
when
in
the
recent
cases
of
cuba
and
greece
the
despatch
of
volunteers
was
actually
encouraged
by
the
government
legality
has
ceased
to
exist
here
we
albanians
are
watched
and
suspected
exactly
as
our
compatriots
now
are
by
the
turks
they
sequestrate
our
manifestos
they
forbid
meetings
and
conferences
they
pry
into
our
postal
correspondence
civil
and
military
authorities
have
conspired
to
prevent
a
single
voice
of
help
and
comfort
reaching
our
brothers
who
call
to
us
from
over
the
sea
a
hard
case
indeed
but
vienna
and
cettinje
might
be
able
to
throw
some
light
upon
it
footnote
this
was
written
before
the
outbreak
of
the
balkan
war
the
albanian
women
here
as
elsewhere
are
the
veriest
beasts
of
burden
unlike
the
italians
they
carry
everything
babies
and
wood
and
water
on
their
backs
their
crudely
tinted
costumes
would
be
called
more
strange
than
beautiful
under
any
but
a
bright
sunshiny
sky
the
fine
native
dresses
of
the
men
have
disappeared
long
ago
they
even
adopted
in
days
past
the
calabrian
hat
which
is
now
only
worn
by
the
older
generation
genuine
calabrians
often
settle
in
these
foreign
villages
in
order
to
profit
by
their
institutions
for
even
now
the
italian
cultivator
is
supposed
to
make
and
actually
does
make
voluntary
presents
to
his
landlord
at
certain
seasons
gifts
which
are
always
a
source
of
irritation
and
in
bad
years
a
real
hardship
the
albanians
opposed
themselves
from
the
very
beginning
against
these
mediaeval
practices
they
do
not
build
houses
says
an
old
writer
so
as
not
to
be
subject
to
barons
dukes
princes
or
other
lords
and
if
the
owner
of
the
land
they
inhabit
them
they
set
fire
to
their
huts
and
go
elsewhere
an
admirable
system
even
nowadays
one
would
like
to
be
here
at
easter
time
to
see
the
pyrrhic
dances
where
the
young
men
group
themselves
in
martial
array
and
pass
through
the
streets
with
song
and
chorus
since
soon
enough
america
will
have
put
an
end
to
such
customs
the
old
albanian
guitar
of
nine
strings
has
already
died
out
and
the
double

presently
follow
suit
this
instrument
familiar
from
classical
sculpture
and
lore
and
still
used
in
sicily
and
sardinia
was
once
a
favourite
with
the
sila
shepherds
who
called
it
fischietto
a
pariglia
but
some
years
ago
i
vainly
sought
it
in
the
central
sila
the
answer
to
my
enquiries
was
everywhere
the
same
they
knew
it
quite
well
so
and
so
used
to
play
it
certain
persons
in
certain
villages
still
made
it
they
described
it
accurately
enough
but
could
not
produce
a
specimen
single
pipes
yes
and
bagpipes
galore
but
the
were
out
of
fashion
wherever
i
asked
for
them
here
in
the
greek
sila
i
was
more
fortunate
a
boy
at
the
village
of
macchia
possessed
a
pair
which
he
obligingly
gave
me
after
first
playing
a
song
a
farewell
song
a
plaintive
ditty
that
required
none
the
less
an
excellent
pair
of
lungs
on
account
of
the
two
mouthpieces
melodies
on
this
double
flageolet
are
played
principally
at
christmas
time
the
two
reeds
are
about
centimetres
in
length
and
made
of
hollow
cane
in
my
specimen
the
left
hand
controls
four
the
other
six
holes
the
albanian
name
of
the
instrument
is
fiscarol
from
a
gentleman
at
vaccarizza
i
received
a
still
more
valuable
present
two
neolithic
celts
aenolithic
i
should
be
inclined
to
call
them
wrought
in
quartzite
and
found
not
far
from
that
village
these
implements
must
be
rare
in
the
uplands
of
calabria
as
i
have
never
come
across
them
before
though
they
have
been
found
to
my
knowledge
at
savelli
in
the
central
sila
at
vaccarizza
they
call
such
relics
pic
they
are
supposed
as
usual
to
be
thunderbolts
and
i
am
also
told
that
a
piece
of
string
tied
to
one
of
them
can
not
be
burnt
in
fire
the
experiment
might
be
worth
trying
meanwhile
the
day
passed
pleasantly
at
vaccarizza
i
became
the
guest
of
a
prosperous
resident
and
was
treated
to
genuine
albanian
hospitality
and
excellent
cheer
i
only
wish
that
all
his
compatriots
might
enjoy
one
meal
of
this
kind
in
their
lifetime
for
they
are
poor
and
their
homes
of
miserable
aspect
like
all
too
many
villages
in
south
italy
this
one
is
depopulated
of
its
male
inhabitants
and
otherwise
dirty
and
neglected
the
impression
one
gains
on
first
seeing
one
of
these
places
is
more
than
that
of
oriental
decay
they
are
not
merely
ragged
at
the
edges
it
is
a
deliberate
and
sinister
chaos
a
note
of
downright
anarchy
a
contempt
for
those
simple
forms
of
refinement
which
even
the
poorest
can
afford
such
persons
one
thinks
can
not
have
much
sense
of
home
and
its
hallowed
associations
they
seem
to
be
everlastingly
ready
to
break
with
the
existing
state
of
things
how
different
from
england
where
the
humblest
cottages
the
roadways
the
very
stones
testify
to
immemorial
love
of
order
to
neighbourly
feelings
and
usages
sanctioned
by
time
they
lack
the
sense
of
home
as
a
fixed
and
topographical
point
as
do
the
arabs
and
russians
neither
of
whom
have
a
word
expressing
our
home
or
heimat
here
the
nearest
equivalent
is
we
think
of
a
particular
house
or
village
where
we
were
born
and
where
we
spent
our
impressionable
days
of
childhood
these
others
regard
home
not
as
a
geographical
but
as
a
social
centre
liable
to
shift
from
place
to
place
they
are
at
home
everywhere
so
long
as
their
clan
is
about
them
that
acquisitive
sense
which
affectionately
adorns
our
meanest
dwelling
slowly
saturating
it
with
memories
has
been
crushed
out
of
them
if
it
ever
existed
by
hard
blows
of
fortune
it
is
safer
they
think
to
transform
the
labour
of
their
hands
into
gold
which
can
be
moved
from
place
to
place
or
hidden
from
the
tyrant
eye
they
have
none
of
our
sentimentality
in
regard
to
inanimate
objects
eliza
cook
feelings
towards
her
old
would
strike
them
as
savouring
of
childishness
hence
the
unfinished
look
of
their
houses
within
and
without
why
expend
thought
and
wealth
upon
that
which
may
be
abandoned
the
two
churches
of
vaccarizza
dark
and
unclean
structures
stand
side
by
side
and
i
was
shown
through
them
by
their
respective
priests
greek
and
catholic
who
walked
arm
in
arm
in
friendly
wise
and
meekly
smiled
at
a
running
fire
of
sarcastic
observations
on
the
part
of
another
citizen
directed
against
the
bottega
in
general
the
as
the
church
is
sometimes
irreverently
called
the
cult
to
which
these
albanians
belong
is
a
compromise
between
the
orthodox
and
roman
their
priests
may
wear
beards
and
marry
wives
they
use
bread
instead
of
the
wafer
for
sacramental
purposes
and
there
are
one
or
two
other
little
differences
of
grave
import
six
albanian
settlements
lie
on
these
northern
slopes
of
the
sila
san
giorgio
vaccarizza
san
cosimo
macchia
san
demetrio
corone
and
santa
sofia
d
epiro
san
demetrio
is
the
largest
of
them
and
thither
after
an
undisturbed
night
rest
at
the
house
of
my
kind
host
the
last
i
fear
for
many
days
to
come
i
drove
in
the
sunlit
hours
of
next
morning
along
the
road
one
can
see
how
thoroughly
the
albanians
have
done
their
work
the
land
is
all
under
cultivation
save
for
a
dark
belt
of
trees
overhead
to
remind
one
of
what
once
it
was
perhaps
they
have
eradicated
the
forest
for
i
observe
in
san
demetrio
that
the
best
drinking
water
has
now
to
be
fetched
from
a
spring
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
village
it
is
unlikely
that
this
should
have
been
the
original
condition
of
affairs
deforestation
has
probably
diminished
the
it
was
exhilarating
to
traverse
these
middle
heights
with
their
aerial
views
over
the
ionian
and
down
towards
the
wide
valley
of
the
crati
and
the
lofty
pollino
range
now
swimming
in
midsummer
haze
the
road
winds
in
and
out
of
gullies
where
rivulets
descend
from
the
mountains
they
are
clothed
in
ilex
and
other
trees
golden
orioles
jays
hoopoes
and
rollers
flash
among
the
foliage
in
winter
these
hills
are
swept
by
boreal
blasts
from
the
apennines
but
at
this
season
it
is
a
delightful
tract
of
land
xxiii
albanians
and
their
college
san
demetrio
famous
for
its
college
lies
on
a
fertile
incline
sprinkled
with
olives
and
mulberries
and
chestnuts
fifteen
hundred
feet
above
they
tell
me
that
within
the
memory
of
living
man
no
englishman
has
ever
entered
the
town
this
is
quite
possible
i
have
not
yet
encountered
a
single
english
traveller
during
my
frequent
wanderings
over
south
italy
gone
are
the
days
of
keppel
craven
and
swinburne
of
eustace
and
brydone
and
hoare
you
will
come
across
sporadic
germans
immersed
in
hohenstaufen
records
or
searching
after
roman
antiquities
butterflies
minerals
or
landscapes
to
paint
you
will
meet
them
in
the
most
unexpected
places
but
never
an
englishman
the
adventurous
type
of
probably
thinks
the
country
too
tame
scholars
too
trite
ordinary
tourists
too
dirty
the
accommodation
and
food
in
san
demetrio
leave
much
to
be
desired
its
streets
are
irregular
lanes
with
cobbles
of
gneiss
and
smothered
under
dust
and
refuse
none
the
less
what
noble
names
have
been
given
to
these
alleys
names
calculated
to
fire
the
ardent
imagination
of
young
albanian
students
and
prompt
them
to
valorous
and
patriotic
deeds
here
are
the
streets
of
odysseus
of
salamis
and
marathon
and
thermopylae
telling
of
the
glory
that
was
greece
via
skanderbeg
and
hypsilanti
awaken
memories
of
more
immediate
renown
corso
dante
alighieri
reminds
them
that
their
italian
hosts
too
have
done
something
in
their
day
the
piazza
francesco
ferrer
causes
their
breasts
to
swell
with
mingled
pride
and
indignation
while
the
via
dell
industria
hints
not
obscurely
at
the
great
truth
that
genius
without
a
capacity
for
taking
pains
is
an
idle
phrase
such
appellations
without
a
doubt
are
stimulating
and
glamorous
but
if
the
streets
themselves
have
seen
a
scavenger
broom
within
the
last
i
am
much
mistaken
the
goddess
hygeia
dost
not
figure
among
their
names
nor
yet
that
byzantine
monarch
whose
infantile
exploit
might
be
in
ripest
maturity
without
attracting
any
attention
in
san
demetrio
to
the
pure
all
things
are
pure
the
town
is
exclusively
albanian
the
roman
catholic
church
has
fallen
into
disrepair
and
is
now
used
as
a
shed
for
timber
but
at
the
door
of
the
albanian
sanctuary
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
intercept
a
native
wedding
just
as
the
procession
was
about
to
enter
the
portal
despite
the
fact
that
the
bride
was
considered
the
ugliest
girl
in
the
place
she
had
been
duly
robbed
by
her
bold
or
possibly
blind
lover
her
features
were
providentially
veiled
beneath
her
nuptial
and
of
her
squat
figure
little
could
be
discerned
under
the
gorgeous
accoutrements
of
the
occasion
she
was
ablaze
with
ornaments
and
embroidery
of
gold
on
neck
and
shoulders
and
wrist
a
wide
lace
collar
fell
over
a
bodice
of
purple
silk
silken
too
and
of
brightest
green
was
her
pleated
skirt
the
priest
seemed
ineffably
bored
with
his
task
and
mumbled
through
one
or
two
pages
of
holy
books
in
record
time
there
were
holdings
of
candles
interchange
of
rings
sacraments
of
bread
and
wine
and
other
solemn
ceremonies
the
most
quaint
being
the
or
crowning
of
the
happy
pair
and
the
moving
of
their
respective
crowns
from
the
head
of
one
to
that
of
the
other
it
ended
with
a
chanting
perlustration
of
the
church
led
by
the
priest
this
is
the
pesatura
i
endeavoured
to
attune
my
mind
to
the
gravity
of
this
marriage
to
the
deep
significance
of
its
smallest
detail
such
rites
i
said
to
myself
must
be
understood
to
be
appreciated
and
had
i
not
been
reading
certain
native
commentators
on
the
subject
that
very
morning
nevertheless
my
attention
was
diverted
from
the
main
issue
the
bridegroom
face
had
fascinated
me
the
male
is
always
at
a
disadvantage
during
grotesquely
splendid
buffooneries
of
this
kind
and
never
in
all
my
life
have
i
seen
a
man
looking
such
a
sorry
fool
as
this
individual
never
especially
during
the
perambulation
when
his
absurd
crown
was
supported
on
his
head
from
behind
by
the
hand
of
his
best
man
meanwhile
a
handful
of
boys
who
seemed
to
share
my
private
feelings
in
regard
to
the
performance
had
entered
the
sacred
precincts
their
pockets
stuffed
with
living
cicadas
these
albanian
youngsters
like
all
true
connaisseurs
are
aware
of
the
idiosyncrasy
of
the
classical
insect
which
when
pinched
or
tickled
on
a
certain
spot
emits
its
characteristic
and
note
the
voice
of
the
greek
bard
the
cicadas
therefore
were
duly
pinched
and
then
let
loose
like
squibs
and
rockets
they
careered
among
the
congregation
dashing
in
our
faces
and
clinging
to
our
garments
the
church
resounded
like
an
at
noon
a
hot
little
hand
conveyed
one
of
these
tremulously
throbbing
creatures
into
my
own
and
obeying
a
whispered
injunction
of
let
it
fly
sir
i
had
the
joy
of
seeing
the
beast
alight
with
a
violent
buzz
on
the
head
of
the
bride
doubtless
the
happiest
of
auguries
such
conduct
on
the
part
of
english
boys
would
be
deemed
very
naughty
and
almost
irreverent
but
here
one
hopes
it
may
have
its
origin
in
some
obscure
but
pious
credence
such
as
that
which
prompts
the
populace
to
liberate
birds
in
churches
at
easter
time
these
escaping
cicadas
it
may
be
are
symbolical
of
matrimony
the
individual
man
and
woman
freed
at
last
from
the
horrors
of
celibate
existence
or
if
that
parallel
be
we
may
conjecture
that
their
liberation
represents
the
afflatus
of
the
human
soul
aspiring
upwards
to
merge
its
essence
into
the
divine
all
the
pride
of
san
demetrio
is
its
college
you
may
read
about
it
in

whoever
wishes
to

itself

of

expert
they
who
are
qualified
to
judge
speak
of
the
college
as
a
beacon
of
learning
an
institution
whose
aims
and
results
are
alike
deserving
of
high
respect
and
certainly
it
can
boast
of
a
fine
list
of
prominent
men
who
have
issued
from
its
walls
this
little
island
of
stern
mental
culture
contains
besides
teachers
and
as
many
servants
some
three
hundred
scholars
preparing
for
a
variety
of
secular
professions
about
fifty
of
them
are
ten
or
thereabouts
are
genuine
albanians
from
over

them
two
dozen
of

unhappy

who
flooded

after

were

of

that
san
demetrio
offers
no
temptations
to
youthful
folly
and
extravagance
in
this
so
far
as
i
can
judge
they
are
perfectly
correct
the
heat
of
summer
and
the
fact
that
the
boys
were
in
the
throes
of
their
examinations
may
have
helped
to
make
the
majority
of
them
seem
pale
and
thin
they
certainly
complained
of
their
food
and
the
cook
was
the
only
person
whom
i
could
discover
in
the
establishment
his
percentages
one
suspects
being
considerable
the
average
yearly
payment
of
each
scholar
for
board
and
tuition
is
only
twenty
pounds
it
used
to
be
twenty
ducats
how
shall
superfluities
be
included
in
the
bill
of
fare
for
such
a
sum
the
are
modernized
the
dormitories
neither
clean
nor
very
dirty
there
is
a
rather
scanty
gymnasium
as
well
as
a
physical
laboratory
and
museum
of
natural
history
among
the
recent
acquisitions
of
the
latter
is
a
vulture
gyps
fulvus
which
was
shot
here
in
the
spring
of
this
year
the
bird
they
told
me
has
never
been
seen
in
these
regions
before
it
may
have
come
over
from
the
east
or
from
sardinia
where
it
still
breeds
i
ventured
to
suggest
that
they
should
lose
no
time
in
securing
a
native
porcupine
an
interesting
beast
concerning
which
i
never
fail
to
enquire
on
my
rambles
they
used
to
be
encountered
in
the
crati
valley
two
were
shot
near
corigliano
a
few
years
ago
and
another
not
far
from
cotronei
on
the
neto
they
still
occur
in
the
forests
near
the
pagliarelle
above
petilia
policastro
but
judging
by
all
indications
i
should
say
that
this
animal
is
rapidly
approaching
extinction
not
only
here
but
all
over
italy
another
very
rare
creature
the
otter
was
killed
lately
at
vaccarizza
but
unfortunately
not
preserved
fencing
and
music
are
taught
but
those
athletic
exercises
which
led
to
the
victories
of
marathon
and
salamis
are
not
much
in
vogue
sana
in
corpare
is
clearly
not
the
ideal
of
the
place
fighting
among
the
boys
is
reprobated
as
savagery
and
corporal
punishment
forbidden
there
is
no
playground
or
workshop
and
their
sole
exercise
consists
in
dull
promenades
along
the
high
road
under
the
supervision
of
one
or
more
teachers
during
which
the
youngsters
indulge
in
attempts
at
games
by
the
wayside
which
are
truly
pathetic
so
the
old
inviolable
constitutions
ordain
that
the
scholars
must
not
play
outside
the
college
and
if
they
meet
any
one
they
should
lower
their
voices
a
rule
of
recent
introduction
is
that
in
this
warm
weather
they
must
all
lie
down
to
sleep
for
two
hours
after
the
midday
meal
it
may
suit
the
managers
but
the
boys
consider
it
a
great
hardship
and
would
prefer
being
allowed
to
play
altogether
whatever
the
intellectual
results
may
be
the
moral
tendency
of
such
an
upbringing
is
damaging
to
the
spirit
of
youth
and
must
make
for
precocious
frivolity
and
brutality
but
the
pedagogues
of
italy
are
like
her
legislators
theorists
they
close
their
eyes
to
the
cardinal
principles
of
all
education
that
the
waste
products
and
toxins
of
the
imagination
are
best
eliminated
by
motor
activities
and
that
the
immature
stage
of
human
development
far
from
being
artificially
shortened
should
be
prolonged
by
every
possible
means
if
the
internal
arrangement
of
this
institution
is
not
all
it
might
be
as
regards
the
healthy
development
of
youth
the
situation
of
the
college
resembles
the
venerable
structures
of
oxford
in
that
it
is
too
good
far
too
good
for
mere
youngsters
this
building
in
its
seclusion
from
the
world
its
pastoral
surroundings
and
panorama
is
an
abode
not
for
boys
but
for
philosophers
a
place
to
fill
with
a
wave
of
deep
content
the
sage
who
has
outgrown
earthly
ambitions
your
eye
embraces
the
heights
of
dolcedorme
and
the
ionian
sea
wandering
over
forests
and
villages
and
rivers
and
long
reaches
of
fertile
country
but
it
is
not
the
variety
of
the
scene
nor
yet
the
historical
memories
of
old
sybaris
which
kindle
the
imagination
so
much
as
the
spacious
amplitude
of
the
whole
prospect
in
england
we
think
something
of
a
view
of
ten
miles
conceive
here
a
grandiose
valley
wider
than
from
dover
to
calais
filled
with
an
atmosphere
of
such
impeccable
clarity
that
there
are
moments
when
one
thinks
to
see
every
stone
and
every
bush
on
the
mountains
yonder
thirty
miles
distant
and
the
towards
sunset
are
such
as
would
inspire
the
brush
of
turner
or
claude
lorraine
for
the
college
as
befits
its
grave
academic
character
stands
by
itself
among
fruitful
fields
and
backed
by
a
chestnut
wood
at
ten
minutes
walk
from
the
crowded
streets
it
is
an
imposing
edifice
the
basilean
convent
of
adrian
with
copious
modern
additions
the
founders
may
well
have
selected
this
particular
site
on
account
of
its
fountain
of
fresh
water
which
flows
on
as
in
days
of
yore
one
thinks
of
those
communities
of
monks
in
the
middle
ages
scattered
over
this
wild
region
and
holding
rare
converse
with
one
another
by
gloomy
forest
paths
how
remote
their
life
and
ideals
in
the
days
of
fiore
the
inmates
of
this
convent
still
practised
their
old
rites
the
nucleus
of
the
building
is
the
old
chapel
containing
a
remarkable
font
two
antique
columns
sawn
up
apparently
for
purposes
of
transportation
from
some
pagan
temple
by
the
shore
one
of
them
being
of
african
marble
and
the
other
of
grey
granite
there
is
also
a
tessellated
pavement
with
of
leopards
and
serpents
akin
to
those
of
patir
bertaux
gives
a
reproduction
of
this
serpent
he
assimilates
it
as
regards
technique
and
age
to
that
which
lies
before
the
altar
of
monte
cassino
and
was
wrought
by
greek
artisans
of
the
abbot
desiderius
the
church
itself
is
held
to
be
two
centuries
older
than
that
of
patir
the
library
once
celebrated
contains
musty
folios
of
classics
and
their
commentators
but
nothing
of
value
it
has
been
ransacked
of
its
treasures
like
that
of
patir
whose
have
been
tracked
down
by
the
patience
and
acumen
of
monsignor
batiffol
batiffol
bertaux
charles
diehl
jules
gay
who
has
also
written
on
san
demetrio
luynes
lenormant
here
are
a
few
french
scholars
who
have
recently
studied
these
regions
and
their
history
what
have
we
english
done
in
this
direction
nothing
absolutely
nothing
such
thoughts
occur
inevitably
it
may
be
insinuated
that
researches
of
this
kind
are
gleanings
that
our
english
genius
lies
rather
in
the
of
pioneers
like
leake
or
layard
granted
but
a
hard
fact
remains
the
fact
namely
that
could
any
of
our
scholars
have
been
capable
of
writing
in
the
large
and
profound
manner
of
bertaux
or
gay
not
one
of
our
publishers
would
have
undertaken
to
print
his
work
not
one
they
know
their
business
they
know
that
such
a
book
would
have
been
a
dead
loss
therefore
let
us
frankly
confess
the
truth
for
things
of
the
mind
there
is
a
smaller
market
in
england
than
in
france
much
only
they
can
tell
who
have
familiarized
themselves
with
other
departments
of
french
thought
here
then
i
have
lived
for
the
past
few
days
strolling
among
the
fields
and
attempting
to
shape
some
picture
of
these
albanians
from
their
habits
and
such
of
their
literature
as
has
been
placed
at
my
disposal
so
far
my
impression
of
them
has
not
changed
since
the
days
when
i
used
to
rest
at
their
villages
in
greece
they
remind
me
of
the
irish
both
races
are
scattered
over
the
earth
and
seem
to
prosper
best
outside
their
native
country
they
have
the
same
songs
and
bards
the
same
the
same
and
frank
hospitality
both
are
sunk
in
bigotry
and
broils
they
resemble
one
another
in
their
love
of
dirt
disorder
and
display
in
their
enthusiastic
and
adventurous
spirit
their
versatile
brilliance
of
mind
their
incapacity
for
and
general
keltic
note
of
inspired
inefficiency
and
both
profess
a
frenzied
allegiance
to
an
obsolete
tongue
which
were
it
really
cultivated
as
they
wish
would
put
a
barrier
of
triple
brass
between
themselves
and
the
rest
of
humanity
even
as
the
irish
despise
the
english
as
their
worldly
and
effete
relatives
so
the
albanians
look
down
upon
the
greeks
even
those
of
pericles
with
profoundest
contempt
the
albanians
so
says
one
of
their
writers
are
the
oldest
people
upon
earth
and
their
language
is
the
divine
pelasgic
i
grew
interested
awhile
in
stanislao
marchiano
plausibly
entrancing
study
on
this
language
as
well
as
in
a
pamphlet
of
de
rada
on
the
same
subject
but
my
ardour
has
cooled
since
learning
from
another
native
grammarian
that
these
writers
are
hopelessly
in
the
wrong
on
nearly
every
point
so
much
is
certain
that
the
albanian
language
already
possesses
more
than
different
each
of
them
with
nearly
fifty
letters
nevertheless
they
have
not
yet
in
these
last
four
or
forty
thousand
years
made
up
their
minds
which
of
them
to
adopt
or
whether
it
would
not
be
wisest
after
all
to
elaborate
yet
another
one
a
and
so
difficult
is
their
language
with
any
of
these
alphabets
that
even
after
a
five
days
residence
on
the
spot
i
still
find
myself
puzzled
by
such
simple
passages
as
this

i
will
only

accents

i
have

is
mere
child
play
to
its
pronunciation
xxiv
an
albanian
seer
sometimes
i
find
my
way
to
the
village
of
macchia
distant
about
three
miles
from
san
demetrio
it
is
a
dilapidated
but
picturesque
cluster
of
houses
situate
on
a
projecting
tongue
of
land
which
is
terminated
by
a
little
chapel
to
saint
elias
the
old
helios
lover
of
peaks
and
promontories
whom
in
his
christian
shape
the
rude
albanian
colonists
brought
hither
from
their
fatherland
even
as
centuries
before
he
had
accompanied
the
byzantines
on
the
same
voyage
and
fifteen
centuries
yet
earlier
the
greeks
at
macchia
was
born
in
of
an
old
and
relatively
wealthy
family
girolamo
de

footnote
thus
his
friend
and
compatriot
michele
marchiano
spells
the
name
in
a
biography
which
i
recommend
to
those
who
think
there
is
no
intellectual
movement
in
south
italy
but
he
himself
at
the
very
close
of
his
life
in
signs
himself
ger
de
rhada
so
this
village
of
macchia
is
spelt
indifferently
by
albanians
as
maki
or
makji
they
have
a
fine
elizabethan
contempt
for
orthography
as
well
they
may
have
with
their
thirty
alphabets
a
patriot
in
whom
the
tempestuous
aspirations
of
modern
albania
took
shape
the
ideal
pursued
during
his
long
life
was
the
regeneration
of
his
country
and
if
the
attention
of
international
congresses
and
linguists
and
folklorists
is
now
drawn
to
this
little
corner
of
the
earth
if
in
newspapers
were
devoted
to
the
albanian
cause
eighteen
in
italy
alone
and
one
even
in
london
it
was
wholly
his
merit
he
was
the
son
of
a
priest
after
a
stern
religious
upbringing
under
the
paternal
roof
at
macchia
and
in
the
college
of
san
demetrio
he
was
sent
to
naples
to
complete
his
education
it
is
characteristic
of
the
man
that
even
in
the
heyday
of
youth
he
cared
little
for
modern
literature
and
speculations
and
all
that
makes
for
exact
knowledge
and
that
he
fled
from
his
latin
teacher
the
celebrated
puoti
on
account
of
his
somewhat
exclusive
love
of
grammatical
rules
none
the
less
though
averse
to
the
materialistic
and
subversive
theories
that
were
then
seething
in
naples
he
became
entangled
in
the
movements
of
the
late
thirties
and
narrowly
avoided
the
which
struck
down
some
of
his
comrades
at
other
times
his
natural
piety
laid
him
open
to
the
accusation
of
reactionary
monarchical
leanings
he
attributed
his
escape
from
this
and
every
other
peril
to
the
hand
of
god
throughout
life
he
was
a
zealous
reader
of
the
bible
a
firm
and
even
ascetic
believer
forever
preoccupied
in
childlike
simplicity
of
soul
with
first
causes
his
spirit
moved
majestically
in
a
world
of
fervent
platitudes
the
whole
cosmos
lay
serenely
distended
before
his
mental
vision
a
benevolent
god
overhead
devising
plans
for
the
prosperity
of
albania
a
malignant
ubiquitous
and
very
real
devil
thwarting
these
his
good
intentions
whenever
possible
mankind
on
earth
sowing
and
reaping
in
the
sweat
of
their
brow
as
was
ordained
of
old
like
many
poets
he
never
disabused
his
mind
of
this
comfortable
form
of
anthropomorphism
he
was
a
firm
believer
too
in
dreams
but
his
guiding
motive
his
sun
by
day
and
star
by
night
was
a
belief
in
the
mission
of
the
pelasgian
race
now
scattered
about
the
shores
of
the
inland
sea
in
italy
sicily
greece
dalmatia
roumania
asia
minor
egypt
a
belief
as
ardent
and
irresponsible
as
that
which
animates
the
enthusiasts
of
england
he
considered
that
the
world
hardly
realized
how
much
it
owed
to
his
countryfolk
according
to
his
views
achilles
philip
of
macedon
alexander
the
great
aristotle
pyrrhus
diocletian
julian
the
apostate
they
were
all
albanians
yet
even
towards
the
end
of
his
life
he
is
obliged
to
confess
but
the
evil
demon
who
for
over
four
thousand
years
has
been
hindering
the
pelasgian
race
from
collecting
itself
into
one
state
is
still
endeavouring
by
insidious
means
to
thwart
the
work
which
would
lead
it
to
that
union
disgusted
with
the
clamorous
and
intriguing
bustle
of
naples
he
retired
at
the
early
age
of
to
his
natal
village
of
macchia
throwing
over
one
or
two
offers
of
lucrative
worldly
appointments
he
describes
himself
as
wholly
disenchanted
with
the
facile
fatuity
of
liberalism
the
fact
being
that
he
lacked
what
a
french
psychologist
has
called
the
of
the
real
his
temperament
was
not
of
the
kind
to
cope
with
actualities
this
retirement
is
an
epoch
in
his
life
it
is
the
grand
renunciation
henceforward
he
loses
personal
touch
with
thinking
humanity
at
macchia
he
remained
brooding
on
albanian
wrongs
devising
remedies
corresponding
with
foreigners
and
writing
ever
writing
consuming
his
patrimony
in
the
cause
of
albania
till
the
direst
poverty
dogged
his
footsteps
i
have
read
some
of
his
italian
works
they
are
curiously
oracular
like
the
whisperings
of
those
fabled
dodonian
oaks
of
his
fatherland
they
heave
with
a
mysticism
he
shares
blake
ruggedness
his
torrential
and
confused
utterance
his
benevolence
his
flashes
of
luminous
inspiration
his
moral
background
he
resembles
that
visionary
in
another
aspect
he
was
a
consistent
and
passionate
adorer
of
the
some
of
the
female
characters
in
his
poems
retain
their
dewy
freshness
their
exquisite
originality
even
after
passing
through
the
translator
crucible
at
the
age
of
he
wrote
a
poem
on
odysseus
which
was
published
under
a
pseudonym
then
three
years
later
there
appeared
a
collection
of
rhapsodies
entitled
milosao
which
he
had
garnered
from
the
lips
of
albanian
village
maidens
it
is
his
work
and
has
been
translated
into
italian
more
than
once
after
his
return
to
macchia
followed
some
years
of
apparent
sterility
but
later
on
and
especially
during
the
last
twenty
years
of
his
life
his
literary
activity
became
prodigious
journalism
folklore
poetry
history
grammar
philology
ethnology
aesthetics
politics
morals
nothing
came
amiss
to
his
gifted
pen
and
he
was
fruitful
say
his
admirers
even
in
his
errors
like
other
men
inflamed
with
one
single
idea
he
boldly
ventured
into
domains
of
thought
where
specialists
fear
to
tread
his
biographer
enumerates
different
works
from
his
pen
they
all
throb
with
a
resonant
note
of
patriotism
they
are
fragments
of
a
heart
and
indeed
it
has
been
said
of
him
that
he
utilized
even
the
grave
science
of
grammar
as
a
battlefield
whereon
to
defy
the
enemies
of
albania
but
perhaps
he
worked
most
successfully
as
a
journalist
his
fiamuri
arberit
the
banner
of
albania
became
the
rallying
cry
of
his
countrymen
in
every
corner
of
the
earth
these
multifarious
writings
and
doubtless
the
novelty
of
his
central
theme
attracted
the
notice
of
german
philologers
and
linguists
of
all
lovers
of
freedom
folklore
and

relationship
between
the

and

created
the
literary
language
of
his
country
and
formulated
its
political
ambitions
whereas
the
hazy

records
complicated
political
intrigues
at
naples
that
are
not
connected
with
his
chief
strivings
the
little
testamento

printed
towards
the
end
of
his
life
is
more
interesting
it
enunciates
his
favourite
and
rather
surprising
theory
that
the
albanians
can
not
look
for
help

sympathy

to

truly
a
remarkable
utterance
and
one
that
illustrates
the
disadvantages
of
living
at
a
distance
from
the
centres
of
thought
had
he
travelled
less
with
the
spirit
and
more
with
the
body
his
opinions
might
have
been
modified
and
corrected
but
he
did
not
even
visit
the
albanian
colonies
in
italy
and
sicily
hence
that
vast
confidence
in
his
mission
a
confidence
born
of
solitude
intellectual
and
geographical
hence
that
yearning
which
tinges
his
apparently
practical
aspirations
he
remained
at
home
ever
poor
and
industrious
wrapped
in
bland
exaltation
and
oblivious
to
contemporary
movements
of
the
human
mind
not
that
his
existence
was
without
external
activities
a
chair
of
albanian
literature
at
san
demetrio
instituted
in
but
suppressed
after
three
years
was
conferred
on
him
in
by
the
historian
and
minister
pasquale
villari
for
a
considerable
time
too
he
was
director
of
the
communal
school
at
corigliano
where
with
characteristic
energy
he
set
up
a
printing
press
violent
journalistic
campaigns
succeeded
one
another
in
he
arranged
for
the
first
congress
of
albanian
language
in
that
town
which
brought
together
delegates
from
every
part
of
italy
and
elicited
a
warm
telegram
of
felicitation
from
the
minister
francesco
crispi
himself
an
albanian
again
in
we
find
him
reading
a
paper
before
the
twelfth
international
congress
of
orientalists
at
rome
but
best
of
all
he
loved
the
seclusion
of
macchia
griefs
clustered
thickly
about
the
closing
years
of
this
unworldly
dreamer
blow
succeeded
blow
one
by
one
his
friends
dropped
off
his
brothers
his
beloved
wife
his
four
sons
he
survived
them
all
he
stood
alone
at
last
a
stricken
figure
in
tragic
and
sublime
isolation
over
eighty
years
old
he
crawled
thrice
a
week
to
deliver
his
lectures
at
san
demetrio
he
still
cultivated
a
small
patch
of
ground
with
enfeebled
arm
composing
for
relaxation
poems
and
rhapsodies
at
the
patriarchal
age
of
they
will
show
you
the
trees
under
which
he
was
wont
to
rest
the
sunny
views
he
loved
the
very
stones
on
which
he
sat
they
will
tell
you
anecdotes
of
his
poverty
of
an
indigence
such
as
we
can
scarcely
credit
during
the
last
months
he
was
often
thankful
for
a
crust
of
bread
in
exchange
for
which
he
would
bring
a
sack
of
acorns
to
feed
the
giver
pigs
destitution
of
this
kind
brought
about
by
unswerving
loyalty
to
an
ideal
ceases
to
exist
in
its
sordid
manifestations
it
exalts
the
sufferer
and
his
life
work
is
there
hitherto
there
had
been
no
albanian
question
to
perplex
the
chanceries
of
europe
he
applied
the
match
to
the
tinder
he
conjured
up
that
phantom
which
refuses
to
be
laid
he
died
in
at
san
demetrio
and
there
lies
entombed
in
the
cemetery
on
the
among
the
oaks
but
you
will
not
easily
find
his
grave
his
biographer
indulges
a
poetic
fancy
in
sketching
the
fair
monument
which
a
grateful
country
will
presently
rear
to
his
memory
on
the
snowy
acroceraunian
heights
it
might
be
well
meanwhile
if
some
simple
commemorative
stone
were
placed
on
the
spot
where
he
lies
buried
had
he
succumbed
at
his
natal
macchia
this
would
have
been
done
but
death
overtook
him
in
the
alien
parish
of
san
demetrio
and
his
remains
were
mingled
with
those
of
its
poorest
citizens
a
microcosmic
illustration
of
that
clannish
spirit
of
albania
which
he
had
spent
a
lifetime
in
endeavouring
to
direct
to
nobler
ends
he
was
the
mazzini
of
his
nation
a
garibaldi
when
the
crisis
comes
may
possibly
emerge
from
that
tumultuous
horde
where
is
the
cavour
xxv
scrambling
to
longobucco
a
driving
road
to
connect
san
demetrio
with
acri
whither
i
was
now
bound
was
begun
they
say
about
twenty
years
ago
one
can
follow
it
for
a
considerable
distance
beyond
the
albanian
college
then
suddenly
it
ends
walking
to
acri
however
by
the
old
track
one
picks
up
here
and
there
little
stretches
of
it
already
overgrown
with
weeds
these
too
break
off
as
abruptly
as
they
began
in
the
wild
waste
for
purposes
of
wheeled
traffic
these
picturesque
but
disconnected
fragments
are
quite
useless
perhaps
the
whole
undertaking
will
be
completed
some
day
as
the
natives
say
when
speaking
of
something
rather
beyond
reasonable
expectation
but
possibly
not
and
in
that
case
meaning
that
all
hope
may
now
be
abandoned
there
is
seldom
any
great
hurry
with
works
of
this
kind
it
would
be
interesting
if
one
could
learn
the
inner
history
of
these
abortive
transactions
i
have
often
tried
in
vain
it
is
impossible
for
an
outsider
to
pierce
the
jungle
of
sordid
mystery
and
intrigue
which
surrounds
them
so
much
i
gathered
that
the
original
contract
was
based
on
the
wages
then
current
and
that
the
price
of
labour
having
more
than
doubled
in
consequence
of
the
discovery
of
america
no
one
will
undertake
the
job
on
the
old
terms
that
is
sufficiently
intelligible
but
why
operations
proceeded
so
slowly
at
first
and
why
a
new
contract
can
not
now
be
drawn
up
who
can
tell
the
persons
interested
blame
the
contractor
who
blames
the
engineer
who
blames
the
dilatory
and
corrupt
administration
of
cosenza
my
private
opinion
is
that
the
last
three
parties
have
agreed
to
share
the
swag
between
them
meanwhile
everybody
has
just
grounds
of
complaint
against
everybody
else
the
six
or
seven
inevitable
lawsuits
have
sprung
up
and
promise
to
last
any
length
of
time
seeing
that
important
documents
have
been
lost
or
stolen
and
that
half
the
original
contracting
parties
have
died
in
the
interval
nobody
knows
what
is
going
to
happen
in
the
end
it
all
depends
upon
whether
some
patriotic
person
will
step
forward
and
grease
the
wheels
in
the
proper
quarter
and
even
then
if
he
hails
from
acri
they
of
san
demetrio
will
probably
work
against
the
project
and
vice
versa
for
no
love
is
lost
between
neighbouring
communities
wonderful
with
what
venomous
feudal
animosity
they
regard
each
other
united
italy
means
nothing
to
these
people
whose
conceptions
of
national
and
public
life
are
those
of
the
cock
on
his
you
will
find
in
the
smallest
places
intelligent
and
men
tradespeople
or
professionals
or
landed
proprietors
but
they
are
seldom
members
of
the
the
municipal
career
is
also
a
business
yes
but
of
another
kind
and
requiring
other
qualifications
like
myself
suffer
no
inconvenience
by
being
obliged
to
follow
the
shorter
and
that
joins
the
two
places
it
rises
steeply
at
first
then
begins
to
wind
in
and
out
among
shady
vales
of
chestnut
and
oak
affording
unexpected
glimpses
now
towards
distant
tarsia
and
now
through
a
glade
on
the
right
on
to
the
ancient
citadel
of
bisignano
perched
on
its
rock
i
reached
acri
after
about
two
and
a
half
hours
walking
it
lies
in
a
theatrical
situation
and
has
a
hotel
but
the
proprietor
of
that
establishment
having
been
described
to
me
as
the
greatest
brigand
of
the
sila
i
preferred
to
refresh
myself
at
a
small
wineshop
whose
manageress
cooked
me
an
uncommonly
good
luncheon
and
served
some
of
the
best
wine
i
had
tasted
for
long
altogether
the
women
here
are
far
more
wideawake
and
civilized
than
those
of
the
neapolitan
province
a
result
of
their
stern
patriarchal
and
of
their
possessing
more
or
less
sensible
husbands
thus
fortified
i
strolled
about
the
streets
one
would
like
to
spend
a
week
or
two
in
a
place
like
this
so
little
known
even
to
italians
but
the
hot
weather
and
bad
feeding
had
begun
to
affect
me
disagreeably
and
i
determined
to
push
on
without
delay
into
cooler
regions
it
would
never
do
to
be
laid
up
at
acri
with
heatstroke
and
to
have
one
last
drops
of
life
drained
away
by
copious
relic
of
practices
and
the
favourite
remedy
for
every
complaint
acri
is
a
large
place
and
its
air
of
prosperity
contrasts
with
the
slumberous
decay
of
san
demetrio
there
is
and
so
much
emigration
into
america
that
nearly
every
man
i
addressed
replied
in
english
new
houses
are
rising
up
in
all
directions
and
the
place
is
celebrated
for
its
rich
citizens
but
these
same
wealthy
men
are
in
rather
a
dilemma
some
local
authority
i
forget
who
has
deduced
from
the
fact
that
there
are
so
many
forges
and
smiths
shops
here
that
this
must
be
the
spot
to
which
the
inhabitants
of
sybaris
banished
their
workers
in
metal
and
other
noisy
professions
now
the
millionaires
would
like
to
be
thought
sybarites
by
descent
but
it
is
hardly
respectable
to
draw
a
pedigree
from
these
outcasts
they
need
not
alarm
themselves
for
acri
as
forbiger
has
shown
is
the
old
acherontia
the
river
acheron
the
mocone
or
mucone
of
flows
at
its
foot
and
from
one
point
of
the
town
i
had
a
fine
view
into
its
raging
torrent
a
wearisome
climb
of
two
hours
brought
me
to
the
greca
the
greek
cross
which
stands
metres
above
how
hot
it
was
in
that
blazing
sun
i
should
be
sorry
to
repeat
the
trip
under
the
same
conditions
a
structure
of
stone
may
have
stood
here
in
olden
days
at
present
it
is
a
diminutive
wooden
crucifix
by
the
roadside
it
marks
none
the
less
an
important
geographical
point
the
boundary
between
the
greek
sila
which
i
was
now
leaving
and
the
sila
grande
the
central
and
largest
region
beyond
this
lies
the
lesser
sila
or
sila
piccola
and
if
you
draw
a
line
from
rogliano
near
cosenza
to
cotrone
you
will
approximately
strike
the
watershed
which
divides
the
sila
grande
from
this
last
and
most
westerly
of
the
three
sila
divisions
after
that
comes
catanzaro
and
the
valley
of
the
corace
the
narrowest
point
of
the
italian
continent
and
then
the
heights
of
serra
and
aspromonte
the
true
italy
of
old
that
continue
as
far
as
reggio
though
i
passed
through
some
noble
groves
of
chestnut
on
the
way
up
the
country
here
was
a
treeless
waste
yet
it
must
have
been
forest
up
to
a
short
time
ago
for
one
could
see
the
beautiful
vegetable
mould
which
has
not
yet
had
time
to
be
washed
down
the
a
driving
road
passes
the
croce
greca
it
joins
acri
with
san
giovanni
the
capital
of
sila
grande
and
with
cosenza
it
was
another
long
hour
march
always
uphill
before
i
reached
a
spacious
green
meadow
or
upland
with
a
few
little
buildings
the
place
is
called
verace
and
lies
on
the
watershed
between
the
upper
crati
valley
and
the
ionian
thenceforward
my
walk
would
be
a
descent
along
the
trionto
river
the
traeis
of
old
as
far
as
which
overlooks
its
flood
it
was
cool
here
at
last
from
the
altitude
and
the
decline
of
day
and
was
going
on
amid
the
pastoral
din
of
and
a
good
deal
of
blithe
and
chattering
after
some
talk
with
these
amiable
folks
i
passed
on
to
where
the
young
traeis
bubbles
up
from
the
cavernous
reservoirs
of
the
earth
of
those
chill
and
roguish
wavelets
i
took
a
draught
mindful
of
the
day
when
long
ago
by
these
same
waters
an
irreparable
catastrophe
overwhelmed
our
european
civilization
for
it
was
the
traeis
near
whose
estuary
was
fought
the
battle
between
sybarites
i
refuse
to
believe
these
figures
and
the
men
of
croton
conducted
by
their
champion
milo
a
battle
which
led
to
the
destruction
of
sybaris
and
incidentally
of
hellenic
culture
throughout
the
mainland
of
italy
this
was
in
the
same
fateful
year
that
witnessed
the
expulsion
of
the
tarquins
from
rome
and
the
pisistratidae
from
athens
pines
the
characteristic
tree
of
the
sila
now
begin
to
appear
passing
through
verace
i
had
already
observed
on
the
left
a
high
mountain
entirely
decked
with
them
it
is
the
ridge
marked
on
the
map
the
trionto
laves
its
foot
but
the
local
pronunciation
of
this
name
is
palépite
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
here
we
have
a
genuine
old
greek
name
perpetuated
by
the
people
and
referring
to
this
covering
of
hoary
pines
a
name
which
the
cartographers
arbitrary
and
ignorant
as
they
often
are
have
unconsciously
disguised
it
occurs
in
some
old
charts
however
as
paleparto
an
instructive
map
of
italy
could
be
drawn
up
showing
the
sites
and
cities
wrongly
named
from
corrupt
etymology
or
falsified
inscriptions
and
those
deliberately
miscalled
out
of
principles
of
local
patriotism
the
whole
country
is
full
of
these
inventions
of
which
date
for
the
most
part
from
the
enthusiastic
but
undisciplined
the
minute
geographical
triangle
comprised
between
cosenza
longobucco
and
san
demetrio
which
i
was
now
traversing
is
one
of
the
least
known
corners
of
italy
and
full
of
dim
hellenic
memories
the
streamlet
calamo
flows
through
the
valley
i
ascended
from
acri
and
at
its
side
a
little
way
out
of
the
town
stands
the
fountain
pompeio
where
the
brigands
not
long
ago
used
to
lie
in
wait
for
women
and
children
coming
to
fetch
water
and
snatch
them
away
for
ransom
on
the
way
up
i
had
glimpses
down
a
thousand
feet
or
more
into
the
mucone
or
acheron
raging
and
foaming
in
its
narrow
valley
it
rises
among
the
mountains
called
fallistro
and
li
tartari
unquestionably
greek
names
on
this
river
and
somewhere
above
acri
stood
according
to
the
scholarly
researches
of
lenormant
the
ancient
city
of
pandosia
i
do
not
know
if
its
site
has
been
determined
since
his
day
it
was
very
strong
and
rich
and
at
its
highest
prosperity
in
the
fourth
century
after
the
fall
of
sybaris
it
passed
under
the
supremacy
of
croton
the
god
pan
was
figured
on
some
of
its
coins
and
appropriately
enough
considering
its
sylvan
surroundings
others
bear
the
head
of
the
nymph
pandosia
with
her
name
and
that
of
the
river
crathis
under
the
guise
of
a
young
shepherd
they
who
wish
to
learn
his
improper
legend
will
find
it
in
the
pages
of
aelian
or
in
chapter
xxxii
of
the
book
of
rhodiginus
beginning
sit
brutorum
affectio
etc
footnote
a
brutis
moribus
so
say
certain
spiteful
writers
an
accusation
which
strabo
and
horace
extend
to
all
calabrians
as
to
the
site
of
pandosia
a
good
number
of
scholars
such
as
old
prosper
parisius
and
luigi
maria
greco
locate
it
at
the
village
of
mendicino
on
the
river
merenzata
which
was
called
arconte
acheron
in
the
middle
ages
so
the
trionto
is
not
unquestionably
the
traeis
and
in
marincola
pistoia
good
little
cose
di
sibari
the
distinction
is
claimed
for
one
of
four
rivers
the
lipuda
colognati
trionto
or
fiuminicà
we
have
here
not
the
greece
of
mediaeval
byzantine
times
much
less
that
of
the
albanians
but
the
sunny
hellas
of
the
days
when
the
world
was
young
when
these
ardent
colonists
sailed
westwards
to
perpetuate
their
names
and
legends
in
the
alien
soil
of
italy
the
mucone
has
always
been
known
as
a
ferocious
and
pitiless
torrent
and
maintains
to
this
day
its
tartarean
reputation
twenty
persons
a
year
they
tell
me
are
devoured
by
its
angry
waters
venti
cristiani
all
anno
this
is
as
bad
as
the
amendolea
near
reggio
but
none
of
its
victims
have
attained
the
celebrity
of
alexander
of
molossus
king
of
epirus
who
perished
under
the
walls
of
pandosia
in
during
an
excursion
against
the
lucanians
he
had
been
warned
by
the
oracle
of
dodona
to
avoid
the
waters
of
acheron
and
the
town
of
pandosia
once
in
italy
however
he
paid
small
heed
to
these
words
thinking
they
referred
to
the
river
and
town
of
the
same
name
in
thesprotia
but
the
gods
willed
otherwise
and
you
may
read
of
his
death
in
the
waters
and
the
laceration
of
his
body
by
the
lucanians
in
livy
history
it
is
a
strange
caprice
that
we
should
now
possess
what
is
in
every
probability
the
very
breastplate
worn
by
the
heroic
monarch
on
that
occasion
it
was
found
in
and
thereafter
sold
some
fragments
of
it
at
least
to
the
british
museum
where
under
the
name
of
bronze
of
siris
it
may
still
be
admired
a
marvellous
piece
of
repoussée
work
in
the
style
of
lysippus
depicting
the
combat
of
ajax
and
the
amazons
the
streamlet
trionto
my
companion
to
longobucco
glides
along
between
stretches
of
flowery
fit
emblem
of
placid
rural
contentment
but
soon
this
lyric
mood
is
spent
it
enters
a
winding
gorge
that
shuts
out
the
sunlight
and
the
landscape
abruptly
assumes
an
epic
note
the
water
tumbles
wildly
downward
hemmed
in
by
mountains
whose
slopes
are
shrouded
in
dusky
pines
wherever
a
particle
of
soil
affords
them
foothold
the
scenery
in
this
valley
is
as
romantic
as
any
in
the
sila
affluents
descend
on
either
side
while
the
swollen
rivulet
writhes
and
screeches
in
its
narrow
bed
churning
the
boulders
with
hideous
din
the
track
meanwhile
continues
to
run
beside
the
water
till
the
passage
becomes
too
difficult
it
must
perforce
attack
the
up
it
climbs
therefore
in
ascension
and
then
meanders
at
a
great
height
above
the
valley
in
and
out
of
its
tributary
glens
i
was
vastly
enjoying
this
promenade
the
shady
pines
whose
fragrance
mingled
with
that
of
a
legion
of
tall
aromatic
plants
in
full
blossom
the
views
upon
the
river
shining
far
below
me
like
the
thread
of
silver
when
i
observed
with
surprise
that
the
whole
which
the
track
must
manifestly
cross
had
lately
slipped
down
into
the
abyss
a
two
or
three
days
ago
as
i
afterwards
learned
had
done
the
mischief
on
arrival
at
the
spot
the
path
was
seen
to
be
interrupted
clean
gone
in
fact
and
not
a
shred
of
earth
or
trees
left
there
confronted
me
a
bare
scar
a
wall
of
naked
rock
which
not
even
a
chamois
could
negotiate
here
was
a
dilemma
i
must
either
retrace
my
steps
along
the
weary
road
to
verace
and
there
seek
a
shelter
with
the
gentle
or
clamber
down
into
the
ravine
follow
the
river
and
chance
it
after
anxious
deliberation
the
latter
alternative
was
chosen
but
the
trionto
was
now
grown
into
a
formidable
torrent
of
surging
waves
and
eddies
with
a
perverse
inclination
to
dash
from
one
side
to
the
other
of
its
prison
so
as
to
necessitate
frequent
fordings
on
my
part
these
watery
passages
which
i
shall
long
remember
were
not
without
a
certain
danger
the
stream
was
still
swollen
with
the
recent
rains
and
its
bed
invisible
under
the
discoloured
element
sufficiently
deep
to
inspire
respect
and
studded
furthermore
with
slippery
boulders
of
every
size
concealing
insidious
gulfs
having
only
a
short
to
support
me
through
this
raging
flood
i
could
not
but
picture
to
myself
the
surprise
of
the
village
maidens
of
crepolati
lower
down
on
returning
to
their
laundry
work
by
the
next
morning
and
discovering
the
battered
anatomy
of
an
englishman
a
rare
fish
in
these
waters
stranded
upon
their
familiar
beach
murdered
of
course
what
a
galaxy
of
brigand
legends
would
have
clustered
round
my
memory
evening
was
closing
in
and
i
had
traversed
the
stream
so
often
and
stumbled
so
long
amid
this
chaos
of
roaring
waters
and
rocks
that
i
began
to
wonder
whether
the
existence
of
longobucco
was
not
a
myth
but
suddenly
at
a
bend
of
the
river
the
whole
town
still
distant
was
revealed
upraised
on
high
and
framed
in
the
yawning
mouth
of
the
valley
after
the
solitary
ramble
of
that
afternoon
my
eyes
familiarized
to
nothing
save
the
wild
things
of
nature
this
unexpected
glimpse
of
complicated
civilized
structures
had
all
the
improbability
of
a
mirage
at
that
moment
arose
before
me
like
those
in
the
arabian
tale
conjured
by
enchantment
out
of
the
desert
waste
the
vision
though
it
swiftly
vanished
again
cheered
me
on
till
after
a
good
deal
more
scrambling
and
wading
with
boots
torn
to
rags
lame
famished
and
drenched
to
the
skin
i
reached
the
bridge
of
the
rossano
highway
and
limped
upwards
in
the
twilight
to
the
hotel
vittoria
soon
enough
be
sure
i
was
enquiring
as
to
supper
but
the
manageress
met
my
suggestions
about
eatables
with
a
look
of
blank
astonishment
was
there
nothing
in
the
house
then
no
cheese
or
meat
or
maccheroni
or
eggs
no
wine
to
drink
nothing
she
replied
why
should
you
eat
things
at
this
hour
you
must
find
them
yourself
if
you
really
want
them
i
might
perhaps
procure
you
some
bread
aux
voyageurs
as
the
french
say
undaunted
i
went
forth
and
threw
myself
upon
the
mercy
of
a
citizen
of
promising
exterior
who
listened
attentively
to
my
case
though
far
too
polite
to
contradict
i
could
see
that
nothing
in
the
world
would
induce
him
to
credit
the
tale
of
my
walking
from
san
demetrio
that
day
it
was
tacitly
relegated
to
the
regions
of
fable
with
considerable
tact
so
as
not
to
wound
my
feelings
he
avoided
expressing
any
opinion
on
so
frivolous
a
topic
nor
did
the
reason
of
his
reluctance
to
discuss
my
exploit
dawn
upon
me
till
i
realized
later
on
that
like
many
of
the
inhabitants
he
had
never
heard
of
the
track
over
acri
and
consequently
disbelieved
its
existence
they
reach
san
demetrio
by
a
two
or
even
three
days
drive
over
rossano
corigliano
and
vaccarizza
he
became
convinced
however
that
for
some
reason
or
other
i
was
hungry
and
thereupon
conducted
me
to
various
places
where
wine
and
other
necessities
of
life
were
procured
the
landlady
watched
me
devouring
this
fare
more
astonished
than
ever
indeed
astonishment
seemed
to
be
her
chronic
condition
so
long
as
i
was
under
her
roof
but
the
promised
bread
was
not
forthcoming
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
was
none
in
the
house
she
had
said
that
she
could
procure
it
for
me
not
that
she
possessed
it
now
since
i
had
given
no
orders
to
that
effect
she
had
not
troubled
about
it
nobody
travels
south
of
rome
strengthened
beyond
expectation
by
this
repast
i
sallied
into
the
night
once
more
and
first
of
all
attended
an
excellent
performance
at
the
local
cinematograph
after
that
i
was
invited
to
a
cup
of
coffee
by
certain
burghers
and
we
strolled
about
the
piazza
awhile
taking
our
pleasure
in
the
cool
air
of
evening
the
town
lies
metres
above
its
streets
are
orderly
and
clean
there
are
no
albanians
and
no
costumes
of
any
kind
here
on
the
square
and
jutting
at
an
angle
from
the
body
of
the
church
stands
a
massive
overgrown
from
head
to
foot
with
pendent
weeds
and
grasses
whose
roots
have
found
a
home
in
the
interstices
of
its
masonry
a
grimly
venerable
pile
full
of
character
weary
but
not
yet
satiated
i
took
leave
of
the
citizens
and
perambulated
the
more
ignoble
quarters
all
of
which
are
decently
lighted
with
electricity
everywhere
in
these
stiller
regions
was
the
sound
of
running
waters
and
i
soon
discerned
that
longobucco
is
an
improvement
on
the
usual
site
affected
by
calabrian
the
enclosure
namely
at
the
junction
of
two
rivers
inasmuch
as
it
has
contrived
to
perch
itself
on
a
lofty
platform
protected
by
no
less
than
three
streams
that
rush
impetuously
under
its
walls
the
trionto
and
two
of
its
affluents
on
the
flank
inclined
towards
the
ionian
there
is
a
veritable
chasm
the
trionto
side
is
equally
difficult
of
approach
the
rear
of
course
inaccessible
no
wonder
the
brigands
chose
it
for
their
chief
citadel
i
am
always
on
the
for
modern
epigraphical
curiosities
regarding
the
subject
as
one
of
profound
social
significance
postage
stamps
indeed
i
have
assiduously
formed
a
collection
the
envy
of
connaisseurs
about
of
whose
material
they
tell
me
might
possibly
be
printed
at
brussels
or
geneva
well
here
is
a
mural
secured
in
the
course
of
this
evening
walk
sic
questo
paese
sporco
incivile
down
with
this
dirty
savage
country
there
is
food
for
thought
in
this
inscription
for
if
some
bilious
stranger
were
its
author
the
sentiments
might
pass
but
coming
from
a
native
to
what
depths
of
morbid
discontent
do
they
testify
considering
the
recent
progress
of
these
regions
that
has
led
to
a
security
and
prosperity
formerly
undreamed
of
one
is
driven
to
the
conjecture
that
these
words
can
only
have
been
penned
by
some
cantankerous
churl
of
an
emigrant
returning
to
his
native
land
after
an
easeful
life
in
new
york
and
compelled
for
his
sins
as
he
would
put
it
to
reside
at
the
hotel
vittoria
towards
that
delectable
hostelry
i
now
turned
somewhat
regretfully
to
face
a
bedroom
whose
appearance
had
already
inspired
me
with
anything
but
confidence
but
hardly
were
the
preliminary
investigations
begun
when
a
furious
noise
in
the
street
below
drew
me
to
the
window
once
more
half
the
town
was
passing
underneath
in
thronged
procession
with
lighted
torches
and
flags
headed
by
the
municipal
band
discoursing
martial
strains
of
music
whither
wending
at
this
midnight
hour
to
honour
a
young
student
native
of
the
place
now
returning
up
the
rossano
road
from
naples
where
he
had
distinguished
himself
prominently
in
some
examination
i
joined
the
crowd
and
presently
we
were
met
by
a
small
carriage
whence
there
emerged
a
pallid
and
frail
adolescent
with
burning
eyes
who
was
borne
aloft
in
triumph
and
cheered
with
that
vociferous
masculine
heartiness
which
we
englishmen
reserve
for
our
popular
and
this
in
the
classic
land
of
brigandage
and
bloodshed
the
intellectual
it
was
an
apt
commentary
on
my
and
another
more
personally
poignant
not
to
say
piquant
was
soon
to
follow
the
bed
but
no
i
will
say
nothing
about
the
bed
nothing
whatever
nothing
beyond
this
that
it
yielded
an
entomological
harvest
which
surpassed
my
wildest
expectations
xxvi
among
the
bruttians
conspicuous
among
the
wise
men
of
longobucco
in
olden
days
was
the
physician
bruno
who
flourished
about
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
he
called
himself
calaber
and
his
great
treatise
on
anatomical
dissection
embodying
much
greek
and
arabic
lore
was
printed
many
years
after
his
death
another
was
francesco
maria
labonia
he
wrote
in
de
vera
loci
urbis
timesinae
situatione
to
prove
presumably
that
his
birthplace
occupied
the
site
whence
the
homeric
ore
of
temese
was
derived
there
are
modern
writers
who
support
this
view
the
local
silver
mines
were
exploited
in
antiquity
first
by
sybaris
then
by
croton
they
are
now
abandoned
but
a
good
deal
has
been
written
about
them
in
the
year
a
thousand
miners
were
employed
and
the
anjous
extracted
a
great
deal
of
precious
metal
thence
the
goldsmiths
of
longobucco
were
celebrated
throughout
italy
during
the
middle
ages
the
industrious
schulz
has
unearthed
a
royal
rescript
of
charging
a
certain
goldsmith
johannes
of
longobucco
with
researches
into
the
metal
and
salt
resources
of
the
whole
kingdom
of
naples
writing
from
longobucco
in
during
a
duret
de
tavel
says
the
high
wooded
mountains
which
surround
this
horrible
place
spread
over
it
a
sombre
and
savage
tint
which
saddens
the
imagination
this
borough
contains
a
hideous
population
of
three
thousand
souls
composed
of
of
blacksmiths
and
the
former
government
employed
them
in
working
the
silver
mines
situated
in
the
neighbourhood
which
are
now
abandoned
he
tells
a
good
deal
about
the
brigandage
that
was
then
rife
here
and
the
atrocities
which
the
repression
of
this
pest
entailed
soon
after
his
arrival
for
instance
four
hundred
soldiers
were
sent
to
a
village
where
the
chiefs
of
the
brigand
insurrection
were
supposed
to
be
sheltered
the
soldiers
he
says
poured
into
the
streets
like
a
torrent
in
flood
and
there
began
a
horrible
massacre
rendered
inevitable
by
the
obstinacy
of
the
insurgents
who
fired
from
all
the
houses
this
unhappy
village
was
sacked
and
burnt
suffering
all
the
horrors
inseparable
from
a
capture
by
assault
two
hundred
dead
were
found
in
the
streets
but
the
brigand
chiefs
the
sole
pretext
of
this
bloodshed
managed
to
escape
perhaps
they
were
not
within
fifty
miles
of
the
place
be
that
as
it
may
they
were
captured
later
on
by
their
own
compatriots
after
the
french
had
waited
a
month
at
longobucco
their
heads
were
brought
in
still
bleeding

wonderful
tales
are
still
told
of
the
brigands
in

forests
they
will
show
you
notches
on

by
such
and
such
a
brigand
for
some
particular
purpose

with
his

even
nowadays
shepherds
sometimes
discover
rude
shelters
of
bark
and

trunks
built
by
them
in

part
of

woods
there
are
legends
too
of
caverns
wherein
they
hived
their
booty
caverns
with
cleverly
concealed
entrances
caverns
which
many
of
them
at
least
i
regard
as
a
pure
invention
modelled
after
the
authentic
brigand
caves
of
salerno
and
abruzzi
where
the
limestone
rock
is
of
the
kind
to
produce
them
bourbonism
fostered
the
brood
and
there
was
a
fierce
recrudescence
in
the
troubled
sixties
they
lived
in
bands
squadrigli
burning
and
plundering
with
impunity
whoever
refused
to
comply
with
their
demands
for
food
or
money
was
sure
to
repent
of
it
all
this
is
over
for
the
time
being
the
brigands
are
extirpated
to
the
intense
relief
of
the
country

who
were
entirely
at

that

this

it
is
an
easy
march
of

hours

less
through

scenery

track

the

the
path
leaves
longobucco
at

climbing
upward
enters
a
valley
which
it
follows
to
its
head
the
peasants
have
cultivated
patches
of
ground
along
the
stream
the
slopes
are
covered
first
with
chestnuts
and
then
with
hoary
firs
a
rare
growth
in
these
parts
from
whose
branches
hangs
the
golden
bough
of
the
mistletoe
and
now
the
stream
is
ended
and
a
dark
ridge
blocks
the
way
it
is
overgrown
with
beeches
under
whose
shade
you
ascend
in
steep
curves
at
the
summit
the
vegetation
changes
once
more
and
you
find
yourself
among
magnificent
stretches
of
pines
that
continue
as
far
as
the
governmental
domain
of
galoppano
a
forestal
station
two
walk
from
longobucco
this
pine
is
a
particular
variety
pinus

known
as
the
pino
della

it
is
found
over
this
whole
country
and
grows
to
a
height
of
forty
metres
with
a
trunk
exhaling
a
delicious
aromatic
fragrance
in
youth
especially
where
the
soil
is
deep
it
shoots
up
prim
and
demure
as
a
nuremberg
toy
but
in
old
age
grows
monstrous
upon
some
lonely
granite
boulder
with
roots
writhing
over
the
bare
stone
like
the
arms
of
an
octopus
it
sits
firm
and
unmoved
deriding
the
tempest
and
flinging
fantastic
limbs
into
the

of

early
did

arrive
at

of
the
estate
but
gross
material
preoccupations
the
prospect
of
a
passable
luncheon
at
san
giovanni
after
the
hotel
vittoria
fare
tempted
me
to
press
forwards
a
boorish
and
individual
volunteered
three
pieces
of
information
that
the
house
was
built
thirty
years
ago
that
a
large
nursery
for
plants
lies
about
ten
kilometres
distant
and
that
this
particular
domain
covers
two
or
four
thousand
hectares
a
young
plantation
of
larches
and
silver
birches
aliens
to
this
region
seemed
to
be
doing
well
not
far
from
here
along
my
track
lies
santa
barbara
two
or
three
huts
with
corn
still
green
like
verace
above
acri
on
the
watershed
between
the
ionian
and
upper
grati
then
follows
a
steep
climb
up
the
slopes
of
mount
pettinascura
whose
summit
lies
metres
above
this
is
the
typical
landscape
of
the
sila
grande
there
is
not
a
human
habitation
in
sight
forests
all
around
with
views
down
vales
into
the
sea
and
towards
the
distant
and
apennines
a
serrated
edge
whose
limestone
precipices
gleam
like
crystals
of
amethyst
between
the
blue
sky
and
the
dusky
woodlands
of
the
foreground
here
i
reposed
awhile
watching
the
crossbills
wondrously
tame
at
work
among
the
branches
overhead
and
the
emerald
lizard
peering
out
of
the
bracken
at
my
side
this
as
they
call
it
is
a
local
beast
very
abundant
in
some
spots
at
venosa
and
patirion
for
example
it
is
elsewhere
conspicuous
by
its
absence
the
natives
are
rather
afraid
of
it
and
still
more
so
of
the
harmless
gecko
the
salamide
which
is
reputed
highly
poisonous
then
up
again
through
dells
and
over
uplands
past
bubbling
streams
sometimes
across
sunlit
meadows
but
oftener
in
the
leafy
shelter
of
maples
and
pines
a
long
but
delightful
track
winding
always
high
above
the
valleys
of
the
neto
and
lese
at
last
towards
midday
i
struck
the
driving
road
that
connects
san
giovanni
with
savelli
crossed
a
bridge
over
the
foaming
neto
and
climbed
into
the
populous
and
dirty
streets
of
the
town
the
siberia
of
calabria
as
it
may
well
be
for
seven
months
of
the
year
at
this
season
thanks
to
its
elevation
of
metres
the
temperature
is
all
that
could
be
desired
and
the
hotel
such
as
it
is
compares
favourably
indeed
with
the
den
at
longobucco
instantly
i
felt
at
home
among
these
good
people
who
recognized
me
and
welcomed
me
with
the
cordiality
of
old
friends
well
they
asked
and
have
you
found
it
at
last
they
remembered
my
looking
for
the
double
flute
the
pares
some
years
ago
it
will
not
take
you
long
to
discover
that
the
chief
objects
of
interest
in
san
giovanni
are
the
women
many
calabrian
villages
still
possess
their
distinctive
costumes
marcellinara
and
are
celebrated
in
this
respect
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
anywhere
an
equal
number
of
handsome
women
on
such
a
restricted
space
in
olden
days
it
was
dangerous
to
approach
these
attractive
and
mirthful
creatures
they
were
jealously
guarded
by
brothers
and
husbands
but
the
brothers
and
husbands
thank
god
are
now
in
america
and
you
may
be
as
friendly
with
them
as
ever
you
please
provided
you
confine
your
serious
attentions
to
not
more
than
two
or
three
secrecy
in
such
matters
is
out
of
the
question
as
with
the
arabs
there
is
too
much
gossip
and
too
little
coyness
about
what
is
natural
your
friendships
are
openly
recognized
and
tacitly
approved
the
priests
do
not
interfere
their
hands
are
full
to
see
these
women
at
their
best
one
must
choose
a
sunday
or
a
one
must
go
morever
to
the
favourite
fountain
of
santa
lucia
which
lies
on
the
and
irrigates
some
patches
of
corn
and
vegetables
their
natural
charms
are
enhanced
by
elaborate
and
tasteful
golden
ornaments
and
by
a
pretty
mode
of
dressing
the
hair
two
curls
of
which
are
worn
hanging
down
before
their
ears
with
an
irresistibly
seductive
air
their
features
are
regular
eyes
black
or
deep
gentian
blue
complexion
pale
movements
and
attitudes
impressed
with
a
stamp
of
rare
distinction
even
the
have
a
certain
austere
dignity
sinewy
indestructible
old
witches
with
tawny
hide
and
eyes
that
glow
like
lamps
and
yet
san
giovanni
is
as
dirty
as
can
well
be
it
has
the
accumulated
filth
of
an
eastern
town
while
lacking
all
its
glowing
tints
or
harmonious
outlines
we
are
disposed
to
associate
squalor
with
certain
artistic
effects
but
it
may
be
said
of
this
and
many
other
calabrian
places
that
they
have
solved
the
problem
how
to
be
ineffably
squalid
without
becoming
in
the
least
picturesque
much
of
this
sordid
look
is
due
to
the
smoke
which
issues
out
of
all
the
windows
and
blackens
the
house
walls
inside
and
out
the
calabrians
persisting
in
a
prehistoric
fashion
of
cooking
on
the
floor
the
buildings
themselves
look
crude
and
gaunt
from
their
lack
of
plaster
and
their
eyeless
windows
black
pigs
wallowing
at
every
doorstep
contribute
to
this
slovenly
the
city
fathers
have
turned
their
backs
upon
civilization
i
dare
say
the
magnitude
of
the
task
before
them
has
paralysed
their
initiative
nothing
is
done
in
the
way
of
public
hygiene
and
one
sees
women
washing
linen
in
water
which
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
an
open
drain
there
is
no
whatever
a
proposal
on
the
part
of
a
north
italian
firm
to
draw
electric
power
from
the
neto
was
scornfully
rejected
one
single
tawdry
lamp
which
was
bought
some
years
ago
as
a
sample
in
a
moment
of
municipal
recklessness
was
lighted
three
times
in
as
many
years
and
on
the
very
day
when
it
was
least
necessary
to
wit
on
midsummer
eve
which
happens
to
be
the
festival
of
their
patron
saint
john
it
now
hangs
so
i
wrote
some
years
ago
at
a
dangerous
angle
and
i
doubt
whether
it
will
survive
till
its
services
are
requisitioned
next
june
prophetic
utterance
it
was
blown
down
that
same
winter
and
has
not
yet
been
replaced
this
in
a
town
of
inhabitants
and
in
italy
where
the
evening
life
of
the
populace
plays
such
an
important
role
no
wonder
north
italians
judging
by
such
external
indications
regard
all
calabrians
as
savages
some
trees
have
been
planted
in
the
piazza
since
my
last
stay
here
a
newspaper
has
also
been
started
it
is
called
organ
of
the
interests
of
san
giovanni
in
fiore
and
its
first
and
possibly
unique
number
contains
a
striking
article
on
the
public
health
as
revealed
in
the
report
of
two
doctors
who
had
been
despatched
by
the
provincial
sanitary
authorities
to
take
note
of
local
conditions
of
hygiene
the
illustrious
scientists
thus
it
runs
were
horrified
at
the
filth
mud
and
garbage
which
encumbered
and
still
encumbers
our
streets
sending
forth
in
the
warm
weather
a
pestilential
odour
they
were
likewise
amazed
at
the
vigorously
expressed
protest
of
our
mayor
who
said
people
can
not
live
without
their
pigs
wallowing
in
the
streets
san
giovanni
in
fiore
is
exempt
from
earthquakes
and
epidemics
because
it
is
under
the
protection
of
saint
john
the
baptist
and
because
its
provincial
councillor
is
a
saintly
man
such
journalistic
plain
speaking
such
lack
of
sweet
reasonableness
can
not
expect
to
survive
in
a
world
governed
by
compromise
and
if
the
gift
of
prophecy
has
not
deserted
me
i
should
say
that
has
by
this
time
ended
its
useful
mission
upon
earth
this
place
is
unhealthy
its
is
not
what
it
should
be
and
such
commodities
as
eggs
and
milk
are
rather
dear
because
the
invalids
eat
everything
of
that
kind
who
are
the
invalids
typhoid
patients
and
above
all
malarious
subjects
who
descend
to
the
plains
as
agricultural
labourers
and
return
infected
to
the
hills
where
they
become
partially
cured
only
to
repeat
the
folly
next
year
it
is
the
same
at
longobucco
and
other
sila
towns
altogether
san
giovanni
has
grave
drawbacks
the
streets
are
too
steep
for
comfort
and
despite
its
height
the
prospect
towards
the
ionian
is
intercepted
by
a
ridge
in
point
of
situation
it
can
not
compare
with
savelli
or
the
neighbouring
casino
which
have
impressive
views
both
inland
and
southward
down
undulating
slopes
that
descend
in
a
stately
procession
of
four
thousand
feet
to
the
sea
where
sparkles
the
gleaming
horn
of
cotrone
and
the
surroundings
of
the
place
are
nowise
representative
of
the
sila
in
a
good
sense
the
land
has
been
so
ruthlessly
deforested
that
it
has
become
a
desert
of
naked
granite
rocks
even
now
in
midsummer
the
citizens
are
already
collecting
fuel
for
their
long
winter
from
enormous
distances
as
one
crawls
and
skips
among
these
unsavoury
tenements
one
can
not
help
regretting
that
saint
john
the
baptist
or
the
piety
of
a
provincial
councillor
should
have
hindered
the
earthquakes
from
doing
their
obvious
duty
were
i
sultan
of
san
giovanni
i
would
certainly
begin
by
a
general
bombardment
little
in
the
town
is
worth
preserving
from
a
cataclysm
save
the
women
and
perhaps
the
old
convent
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
where
the
french
lodged
during
their
and
that
other
one
famous
in
the
ecclesiastical
annals
of
calabria
the
monastery
of
floriacense
founded
at
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
round
which
the
town
gradually
grew
up
its
ponderous
portal
is
much
injured
having
been
burnt
i
was
told
by
the
brigands
in
but
the
notary
who
kindly
looked
up
the
archives
for
me
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
french
are
responsible
for
the
damage
it
contains
or
contained
a
fabulous
collection
of
pious
lumber
teeth
and
and
other
relics
the
catalogue
of
which
is
one
of
my
favourite
sections
of
father
fiore
work
i
would
make
an
exception
also
in
favour
of
the
doorway
of
the
church
a
finely
proportioned
structure
of
the
renaissance
in
black
stone
which
looks
ill
at
ease
among
its
ignoble
environment
a
priest
to
whom
i
applied
for
information
as
to
its
history
told
me
with
the
usual
calabrian
frankness
that
he
never
bothered
his
head
about
such
things
san
giovanni
was
practically
unknown
to
the
outside
world
up
to
a
few
years
ago
i
question
whether
lenormant
or
any
of
them
came
here
pacicchelli
did
however
in
the
seventeenth
century
though
he
has
left
us
no
description
of
the
place
he
crossed
the
whole
sila
from
the
ionian
to
the
other
sea
i
like
this
amiable
and
loquacious
creature
restlessly
gadding
about
europe
gloriously
complacent
hopelessly
absorbed
in
trivialities
and
credulous
beyond
belief
in
fact
as
the
reader
may
have
observed
i
like
all
these
old
travellers
not
so
much
for
what
they
actually
say
as
for
their
implicit
outlook
upon
life
this
pacicchelli
was
a
fellow
of
our
royal
society
and
his
accounts
of
england
are
worth
reading
here
in
calabria
being
a
his
familiar
letters
and
memoirs
of
travel
act
as
a
wholesome
corrective
which
of
the
local
historians
would
have
dared
to
speak
of
cosenza
as
città
aperta
scomposta
e
disordinata
di
fabbriche
that
these
inhabitants
of
the
sila
are
bruttians
may
be
inferred
from
the
superior
position
occupied
by
their
who
are
quite
differently
treated
to
those
of
the
lowlands
there
all
along
the
coasts
of
south
italy
the
is
still
found
unkempt
and
uncivilized
there
the
male
is
the
exclusive
bearer
of
culture
such
things
are
not
seen
among
the
bruttians
of
the
sila
any
more
than
among
the
grave
latins
or
samnites
these
races
are
generally
speaking
honest
dignified
and
incurious
they
are
bigoted
not
to
say
fanatical
and
their
women
are
not
exclusively
beasts
of
burden
being
better
dressed
better
looking
and
often
as
intelligent
as
the
men
they
are
the
fruits
of
a
female
selection
but
wherever
the
mocking
ionic
spirit
has
penetrated
and
the
ionian
women
occupied
even
a
lower
position
than
those
of
the
dorians
and
aeolians
it
has
resulted
in
a
glorification
of
masculinity
hand
in
hand
with
this
depreciation
of
the
female
sex
go
other
characteristics
which
point
to
hellenic
influences
lack
of
commercial
morality
of
veracity
of
seriousness
in
religious
matters
a
persistent
inquisitiveness
a
levity
or
sprightliness
if
you
prefer
it
of
mind
the
people
are
fetichistic
rather
than
devout
we
may
certainly
suspect
greek
or
saracen
strains
wherever
women
are
held
in
low
estimation
wherever
as
the
god
apollo
himself
said
the
mother
is
but
the
nurse
in
the
uplands
of
calabria
the
mother
is
a
good
deal
more
than
the
nurse
for
the
rest
it
stands
to
reason
that
in
proportion
as
the
agricultural
stage
supplants
that
of
pasturage
the
superior
strength
and
utility
of
boys
over
girls
should
become
more
apparent
and
this
in
south
italy
is
universally
proclaimed
by
the
fact
that
everything
large
and
fine
is
laughingly
described
as
maschio
male
and
by
some
odd
superstitions
in
disparagement
of
the
female
sex
such
as
these
that
in
giving
presents
to
women
uneven
numbers
should
be
selected
lest
even
ones
do
them
more
good
than
they
deserve
that
to
touch
the
hump
of
a
female
hunchback
brings
no
luck
whatever
that
if
a
woman
be
the
first
to
drink
out
of
a
new
earthenware
pitcher
the
vessel
may
as
well
be
thrown
away
at
once
it
is
tainted
for
ever
footnote
in
japan
says
hearn
the
first
bucketful
of
water
to
be
drawn
out
of
a
cleaned
well
must
be
drawn
by
a
man
for
if
a
womsn
first
draw
water
the
well
will
always
hereafter
remain
muddy
some
of
these
prejudices
seem
to
be
based
on
primordial
misreadmgs
of
physiology
there
is
also
a
strong
feeling
in
favour
of
dark
hair
no
mother
would
entrust
her
infant
to
a
fair
the
milk
even
of
white
cows
is
considered
lymphatic
and
not
strengthening
perhaps
the
eggs
of
white
hens
are
equally
devoid
of
the
fortifying
principle
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
this
since
in
proportion
as
we
go
south
the
risk
of
irritation
photophobia
and
other
incidental
to
the
xanthous
complexion
becomes
greater
yet
the
birth
of
a
daughter
is
no
chinese
calamity
even
girls
are
christians
and
welcomed
as
such
the
populace
having
never
sunk
to
the
level
of
our
theologians
who
were
wont
to
discuss
faemina
sint
all
over
the
sila
there
is
a
large
preponderance
of
women
over
men
nearly
the
whole
male
section
of
the
community
save
the
quite
young
and
the
decrepit
being
in
america
this
emigration
brings
much
money
into
the
country
and
many
new
ideas
but
the
inhabitants
have
yet
to
learn
the
proper
use
of
their
wealth
and
to
acquire
a
modern
standard
of
comfort
together
with
the
sardinians
these
calabrians
are
the
hardiest
of
native
races
and
this
is
what
makes
them
prefer
the
strenuous
but
lucrative
life
in
north
american
mines
to
the
easier
career
in
argentina
which
neapolitans
favour
there
they
learn
english
they
remember
their
families
and
the
village
that
gave
them
birth
but
their
patriotism
towards
casa
savoia
is
of
the
slenderest
how
could
it
be
otherwise
i
have
spoken
to
numbers
of
them
and
this
is
what
they
say
this
country
has
done
nothing
for
us
why
should
we
fight
its
battles
not
long
ago
we
were
almost
devouring
each
other
in
our
hunger
what
did
they
do
to
help
us
if
we
have
emerged
from
misery
it
is
due
to
our
own
initiative
and
the
work
of
our
own
hands
if
we
have
decent
clothes
and
decent
houses
it
is
because
they
drove
us
from
our
old
homes
with
their
infamous
to
seek
work
abroad
perfectly
true
they
have
redeemed
themselves
though
the
new
regime
has
hardly
had
a
fair
trial
and
the
drawbacks
of
emigration
such
as
a
slight
increase
of
tuberculosis
and
alcoholism
are
nothing
compared
with
the
unprecedented
material
prosperity
and
enlightenment
there
has
also
been
in
these
parts
at
all
events
a
marked
diminution
of
crime
no
wonder
seeing
that
of
the
most
energetic
and
turbulent
elements
are
at
present
in
america
where
they
recruit
the
black
hand
that
the
bruttian
is
not
yet
ripe
for
town
life
that
his
virtues
are
pastoral
rather
than
civic
might
have
been
expected
but
the
arab
domination
of
much
of
his
territory
one
suspects
may
have
infused
fiercer
strains
into
his
character
and
helped
to
deserve
for
him
that
epithet
of
by
which
he
is
proud
to
be
known
xxvii
calabrian
brigandage
the
last
genuine
bandit
of
the
sila
was
gaetano
ricca
on
account
of
some
trivial
misunderstanding
with
the
authorities
this
man
was
compelled
in
the
early
eighties
to
take
to
the
woods
where
he
lived
a
wild
life
alla
campagna
alla
macchia
for
some
three
years
a
price
was
set
on
his
head
but
his
daring
and
knowledge
of
the
country
intimidated
every
one
i
should
be
sorry
to
believe
in
the
number
of
carbineers
he
is
supposed
to
have
killed
during
that
period
no
doubt
the
truth
came
out
during
his
subsequent
trial
on
one
occasion
he
was
surrounded
and
while
the
officer
in
command
of
his
pursuers
who
had
taken
refuge
behind
a
tree
ordered
him
to
yield
ricca
waited
patiently
till
the
point
of
his
enemy
foot
became
visible
when
he
pierced
his
with
his
last
bullet
and
escaped
he
afterwards
surrendered
and
was
imprisoned
for
twenty
years
or
so
then
returned
to
the
sila
where
up
to
a
short
time
ago
he
was
enjoying
a
green
old
age
in
his
home
at
parenti
parenti
already
celebrated
in
the
annals
of
brigandage
by
the
exploit
of
the
perfidious
francatripa
giacomo
pisani
who
under
pretence
of
hospitality
enticed
a
french
company
into
his
clutches
and
murdered
its
three
officers
and
all
the
men
save
seven
the
memoirs
of
such
men
might
be
as
interesting
as
those
of
the
sardinian
giovanni
tolù
which
have
been
printed
i
would
certainly
have
paid
my
respects
to
ricca
had
i
been
aware
of
his
existence
when
some
years
back
i
passed
through
parenti
on
my
way
a
long
day
march
from
rogliano
to
san
giovanni
he
has
died
in
the
interval
but
the
case
of
ricca
is
a
sporadic
one
such
as
may
crop
up
anywhere
and
at
any
time
it
is
like
that
of
musolino
the
case
of
an
isolated
outlaw
who
finds
the
perplexed
geographical
configuration
of
the
country
convenient
for
offensive
and
defensive
purposes
calabrian
brigandage
as
a
whole
has
always
worn
a
political
character
the
men
who
gave
the
french
so
much
trouble
were
political
brigands
allies
of
bourbonism
they
were
commanded
by
creatures
like
mammone
an
anthropophagous
monster
whose
boast
it
was
that
he
had
personally
killed
persons
with
the
greatest
refinements
of
cruelty
and
who
wore
at
his
belt
the
skull
of
one
of
them
out
of
which
he
used
to
drink
human
blood
at
mealtime
he
drank
his
own
blood
as
well
indeed
he
never
dined
without
having
a
bleeding
human
heart
on
the
table
this
was
the
man
whom
king
ferdinand
and
his
spouse
loaded
with
gifts
and
decorations
and
addressed
as
our
good
friend
and
general
the
faithful
support
of
the
throne
the
numbers
of
these
savages
were
increased
by
shiploads
of
professional
sent
over
from
sicily
by
the
english
to
help
their
bourbon
friends
some
of
these
actually
wore
the
british
uniform
one
of
the
most
ferocious
was
known
as
the
englishman
one
must
go
to
the
to
the
archives
in
order
to
gain
some
idea
of
the
sanguinary
anarchy
that
desolated
south
italy
in
those
days
the
horrors
of
feudalism
aided
by
the
earthquake
of
and
by
the
effects
of
cardinal
ruffo
holy
crusade
had
converted
the
country
into
a
pandemonium
in
a
single
year
thousand
crimes
were
recorded
against
the
brigands
of
the
kingdom
of
naples
in
a
single
month
they
are
said
to
have
committed
murders
in
calabria
alone
these
were
the
bands
who
were
described
by
british
officers
as
our
chivalrous
it
is
good
to
bear
these
facts
in
mind
when
judging
of
the
present
state
of
this
province
for
the
traces
of
such
a
reign
of
terror
are
not
easily
expunged
good
also
to
remember
that
this
was
the
period
of
the
highest
spiritual
eminence
to
which
south
italy
has
ever
attained
its
population
of
four
million
inhabitants
were
then
consoled
by
the
presence
of
no
less
than
holy
persons
to
wit
archbishops
bishops
ordained
priests
monks
and
nuns
some
of
these
ecclesiastics
like
the
bishop
of
capaccio
were
notable
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
french
were
sufficiently
coldblooded
in
their
reprisals
colletta
himself
saw
at
lagonegro
a
man
impaled
by
order
of
a
french
colonel
and
some
account
of
their
excesses
may
be
gleaned
from
duret
de
tavel
from
rivarol
rather
a
disappointing
author
and
from
the
flamboyant
epistles
of
courier
a
of
rare
charm
who
lost
everything
in
this
campaign
perdu

a

but
even
that
did
not
destroy
the
plague
the
situation
called
for
a
genial
and
ruthless
annihilator
a
man
like
sixtus
v
who
asked
for
brigands
heads
and
got
them
so
plentifully
that
they
lay
thick
as
melons
in
the
market
under
the
walls
of
rome
while
the
castel
angelo
was
tricked
out
like
a
christmas
tree
with
quartered
corpses
a
man
who
told
the
authorities
when
they
complained
of
the
insufferable
stench
of
the
dead
that
the
smell
of
living
iniquity
was
far
worse
such
a
man
was
wanted
therefore
in
murat
gave
to
general
manhes
the
greatest
of
modern
times
to
extirpate
the
ruffians
root
and
branch
he
had
just
distinguished
himself
during
a
similar
errand
in
the
abruzzi
and
on
arriving
in
calabria
issued
proclamations
of
such
inhuman
severity
that
the
inhabitants
looked
upon
them
as
a
joke
they
were
quickly
undeceived
the
general
seems
to
have
considered
that
the
end
justified
the
means
and
that
the
peace
and
happiness
of
a
province
was
not
to
be
disturbed
year
after
year
by
the
malignity
of
a
few
thousand
rascals
his
threats
were
carried
out
to
the
letter
and
whatever
may
be
said
against
his
methods
he
certainly
succeeded
at
the
end
of
a
few
months
campaign
every
single
brigand
and
all
their
friends
and
relations
were
wiped
off
the
face
of
the
earth
together
with
a
very
considerable
number
of
innocent
persons
the
high
roads
were
lined
with
decapitated
bandits
the
town
walls
decked
with
their
heads
some
villages
had
to
be
abandoned
on
account
of
the
stench
the
crati
river
was
swollen
with
corpses
and
its
banks
whitened
with
bones
god
alone
knows
the
cruelties
which
were
enacted
colletta
confesses
that
he
lacks
courage
to
relate
them
here
is
his
account
of
the
fate
of
the
brigand
chief
benincasa
betrayed
and
bound
by
his
followers
as
he
slept
in
the
forest
of
cassano
benincasa
was
brought
to
cosenza
and
general
manhes
ordered
that
both
his
hands
be
lopped
off
and
that
he
be
led
thus
mutilated
to
his
home
in
san
giovanni
and
there
hanged
a
cruel
sentence
which
the
wretch
received
with
a
bitter
smile
his
right
hand
was
first
cut
off
and
the
stump
bound
not
out
of
compassion
or
regard
for
his
life
but
in
order
that
all
his
blood
might
not
flow
out
of
the
opened
veins
seeing
that
he
was
reserved
for
a
more
miserable
death
not
a
cry
escaped
him
and
when
he
saw
that
the
first
operation
was
over
he
voluntarily
laid
his
left
hand
upon
the
block
and
coldly
watched
the
second
mutilation
and
saw
his
two
amputated
hands
lying
on
the
ground
which
were
then
tied
together
by
the
thumbs
and
hung
round
his
neck
an
awful
and
piteous
spectacle
this
happened
at
cosenza
on
the
same
day
he
began
his
march
to
san
giovanni
in
fiore
the
escort
resting
at
intervals
one
of
them
offered
the
man
food
which
he
accepted
he
ate
and
drank
what
was
placed
in
his
mouth
and
not
so
much
in
order
to
sustain
life
as
with
real
pleasure
he
arrived
at
his
home
and
slept
through
the
following
night
on
the
next
day
as
the
hour
of
execution
approached
he
refused
the
comforts
of
religion
ascended
the
gallows
neither
swiftly
nor
slowly
and
died
admired
for
his
brutal
intrepidity
footnote
this
particular
incident
was
flatly
denied
by
manhes
in
a
letter
dated
which
is
in
the
notizia
storica
del
conte
manhes
naples
one
of
a
considerable
number
of
books
that
cropped
up
about
this
time
one
is
apt
to
have
quite
a
wrong
impression
of
manhes
that
inexorable
but
incorruptible
scourge
of
evildoers
one
pictures
him
a
veteran
scarred
and
gloomy
and
learns
on
the
contrary
that
he
was
only
years
old
at
this
time
gracious
in
manner
and
of
surprising
personal
beauty
for
the
first
time
since
long
calabria
was
purged
ever
since
the
bruttians
irreclaimable
plunderers
had
established
themselves
at
cosenza
disquieting
their
old
hellenic
neighbours
the
recesses
of
this
country
had
been
a
favourite
retreat
of
political
malcontents
here
spartacus
drew
recruits
for
his
band
of
rebels
here
king
marcene
defied
the
oppressive
spanish
viceroys
and
i
blame
neither
him
nor
his
imitators
since
the
career
of
bandit
was
one
of
the
very
few
that
still
commended
itself
to
decent
folks
under
that
regime
during
the
interregnum
of
bourbonism
between
murat
and
garibaldi
the
mischief
revived
again
in
a
political
form
brigands
drew
pensions
from
kings
and
popes
and
the
system
gave
rise
to
the
most
comical
incidents
the
story
of
the
pensioned
malefactors
living
together
at
monticello
reads
like
an
extravaganza
it
was
the
spirit
of
offenbach
brooding
over
europe
one
of
the
funniest
episodes
was
a
visit
paid
in
by
the
disconsolate
moens
to
the
talarico
who
was
then
living
in
grand
style
on
a
government
pension
her
husband
had
been
captured
by
the
band
of
manzi
another
brigand
and
expected
to
be
murdered
every
day
and
the
lady
succeeded
in
procuring
from
the
chivalrous
monster
an
extremely
handsome
man
very
tall
with
the
smallest
and
most
delicate
hands
an
exquisite
letter
to
his
colleague
recommending
him
to
be
merciful
to
the
englishman
and
to
emulate
his
own
conduct
in
that
respect
the
letter
had
no
effect
apparently
but
moens
escaped
at
last
and
wrote
his
memoirs
while
manzi
was
caught
and
executed
in
after
a
trial
occupying
nearly
a
month
during
which
the
jury
had
to
answer
questions
his
villainies
were
manifold
but
they
were
put
in
the
shade
by
those
of
others
of
his
calling
of
caruso
for
example
who
was
known
to
have
massacred
in
one
month
september
two
hundred
persons
with
his
own
hands
then
as
formerly
the
church
favoured
the
malefactors
and
i
am
personally
acquainted
with
priests
who
fought
on
the
side
of
the
brigands
francis

endeavoured
to
retrieve
his
kingdom
by
the
help
of
an
army
of
scoundrels
like
those
of
ruffo
but
the
troops
shot
them
down
brigandage
as
a
governmental
institution
came
to
an
end
unquestionably
the
noblest
figure
in
this
reactionary
movement
was
that
of
josé
borjès
a
brave
man
engaged
in
an
unworthy
cause
you
can
read
his
tragic
journal
in
the
pages
of
monnier
or
maffei
it
has
been
calculated
that
during
these
last
years
of
bourbonism
the
brigands
committed
seven
thousand
homicides
a
year
in
the
kingdom
of
naples
schools
and
emigration

now
brought
sounder
ideas
among

the
secularization

the
abolition

sixtus

wisely
done
away

it

broken
up
the
prosperous
old
bond
between
monks
and
malefactors
what
the
government
has
done
towards
establishing
decent
communications
in
this
once
lawless
and
pathless
country
ranks
in
its
small
way
beside
the
achievement
of
the
french
who
in
algeria
have
built
nearly
ten
thousand
miles
of
road
but
it
is
well
to
note
that
even
as
the
mechanical
appliance
of
steam
destroyed
the
corsairs
the
external
plague
so
this
hoary
form
of
internal
disorder
could
have
been
permanently
eradicated
neither
by
humanity
nor
by
severity
a
scientific
invention
the
electric
telegraph

the
guarantee
of
peace
against
the
rascals
these
brigand
chiefs
were
often
loaded
with
gold
on
killing
them
the
first
thing
the
french
used
to
do
was
to
strip
them

breasts
of
their
waistcoats
with
gorgeous
brooches
at
each
fastening
some
of
their
wealth

in
certain

gave
them
shelter
in

they

legal
one
were
sometimes
benevolently
inclined
but
occasionally
they
conceived
the
happy
idea
of
being
paid
for
their
silence

services
the
brigand
then
was
hoist
with
his
own
petard

forced
to
disgorge
his
summer

extorted

commissions
and

reports
above
all
it
talks
prodigiously
and
very
much
to
the
purpose
but
it
omits
to
administer
its
own
laws
with
becoming
severity
a
few
exemplary
fines
and
imprisonments
would
have
a
more
salutary
effect
than
the
commissioning
of
a
thousand
inspectors
whom
nobody
takes
seriously
and
the
printing
of
ten
thousand
reports
which
nobody
reads
with
a
single
stroke
of
the
pen
the
municipalities
could
put
an
end
to
the
worst
form
of
forest
extirpation
that
on
the
by
forbidding
access
to
such
tracts
and
placing
them
under
the
vincolo
forestale
to
denude
slopes
in
the
moist
climate
and
deep
soil
of
england
entails
no
risk
in
this
country
it
is
the
beginning
of
the
end
and
herein
lies
the
ineptitude
of
the
italian
regulations
which
entrust
the
collective
wisdom
of
rapacious
farmers
with
measures
of
this
kind
taking
no
account
of
the
destructively
utilitarian
character
of
the
native
mind
of
that
which
overlooks
a
distant
profit
in
its
eagerness
to
grasp
the
present
that
beast
avarice
which
horace
recognized
as
the
root
of
all
evil
as
if
provisions
like
this
of
the
vincolo
forestale
were
ever
carried
out
peasants
naturally
prefer
to
burn
the
wood
in
their
own
chimneys
or
to
sell
it
and
if
a
landslide
then
crashes
down
wrecking
houses
and
vineyards
let
the
government
compensate
the
victims
an
ounce
of
fact
in
one
year
alone
and
in
the
sole
province
of
cosenza
wherein
san
giovanni
lies
there
were
landslides
they
destroyed
hectares
of
land
and
their
damage
amounted
to
francs
the
two
other
calabrian
provinces
reggio
and
catanzaro
doubtless
also
had
their
full
quota
of
these
catastrophes
all
due
to
mischievous
deforestation
so
the
bare
rock
is
exposed
and
every
hope
of
planting
at
an
end
clamantis
the
normans
anjou
and
aragonese
concerned
themselves
with
the
proper
administration
of
woodlands
even
the
spanish
viceroys
that
ineffable
brood
issued
rigorous
enactments
on
the
subject
while
the
bourbons
to
give
the
devil
his
due
actually
distinguished
themselves
as
conservators
of
forests
as
to
napoleon
he
was
busy
enough
one
would
think
on
this
side
of
the
alps
yet
he
found
time
to
frame
wise
regulations
concerning
trees
which
the
present
patriotic
parliament
during
half
a
century
of
frenzied
confabulation
has
not
yet
taken
to
heart
how
a
great
man
will
leave
his
mark
on
minutiae
i
passed
through
the
basin
of
this
future
lake
when
in
accordance
with
my
project
i
left
san
giovanni
to
cross
the
remaining
sila
in
the
direction
of
catanzaro
this
getting
up
at
by
the
way
rather
upsets
one
daily
routine
at
breakfast
time
i
already
find
myself
enquiring
anxiously
for
dinner
the
ampollina
valley
lies
high
here
in
the
dewy
grass
i
enjoyed
what
i
well
knew
would
be
my
last
shiver
for
some
time
to
come
then
moved
for
a
few
miles
on
the
further
bank
of
the
rivulet
along
that
driving
road
which
will
soon
be
submerged
under
the
waters
of
the
lake
and
struck
up
a
wooded
glen
called
barbarano
at
its
head
lies
the
upland
circilla
there
is
no
rock
scenery
worth
mentioning
in
all
this
sila
country
no
waterfalls
or
other
alpine
features
it
is
a
venerable
granitic
tableland
that
has
stood
here
while
the
proud
apennines
were
still
slumbering
in
the
oozy
bed
of
ocean
footnote
nissen
says
that
no
landscape
of
italy
has
lost
so
little
of
its
original
appearance
in
the
course
of
history
as
calabria
this
may
apply
to
the
mountains
but
the
lowlands
have
suffered
hideous
changes
a
region
of
gentle
undulations
the
covered
with
the
valleys
partly
arable
and
partly
pasture
were
it
not
for
the
absence
of
heather
with
its
peculiar
mauve
tints
the
traveller
might
well
imagine
himself
in
scotland
there
is
the
same
smiling
alternation
of
woodland
and
meadow
the
same
huge
boulders
of
gneiss
and
granite
which
give
a
distinctive
tone
to
the
landscape
the
same
exuberance
of
living
waters
water
indeed
is
one
of
the
glories
of
the
sila
everywhere
it
bubbles
forth
in
chill
rivulets
among
the
stones
and
trickles
down
the
to
join
the
larger
streams
that
wend
their
way
to
the
forlorn
and
coastlands
of
magna
graecia
often
as
i
refreshed
myself
at
these
icy
fountains
did
i
thank
providence
for
making
the
sila
of
primitive
rock
and
not
of
the
thirsty
apennine
limestone
much
water
in
the
sila
an
old
shepherd
once
observed
to
me
much
water
and
little
tobacco
one
of
the
largest
of
these
rivers
is
the

the
classic
neaithos
sung
by
theocritus
which
falls
into
the
sea
north
of
cotrone
san
giovanni
overlooks
its
raging
flood
and
with
the
help
of
a
little
imagination
here
and
there
its
whole
course
can
be
traced
from
eminences
like
that
of
pettinascura
the
very
name
of
these
streams
neto
arvo
lese
ampollina
are
redolent
of
pastoral
life
all
of
them
are
stocked
with
trout
they
meander
in
their
upper
reaches
through
valleys
grazed
by
flocks
of
sheep
and
goats
and
grey
cattle
the
experiment
of
acclimatizing
swiss
cattle
has
proved
a
failure
i
know
not
why
and
their
banks
are
brilliant
with
blossoms
later
on
in
the
autumn
the
thistles
begin
to
predominate
the
finest
of
them
being
a
noble
ground
thistle
of
pale
gold
of
which
they
eat
the
unopened
bud
it
is
the
counterpart
of
the
silvery
one
of
the
alps
the
air
in
these
upper
regions
is
keen
i
remember
some
years
ago
that
during
the
last
week
of
august
a
lump
of
snow
which
a
produced
as
his
contribution
to
our
luncheon
did
not
melt
in
the
bright
sunshine
on
the
summit
of
monte
nero
from
whichever
side
one
climbs
out
of
the
surrounding
lowlands
into
the
sila
plateau
the
same
succession
of
trees
is
encountered
to
the
warmest
zone
of
olives
lemons
and
carobs
succeeds
that
of
the
chestnuts
some
of
them
of
gigantic
dimensions
and
yielding
a
sure
though
moderate
return
in
fruit
others
cut
down
periodically
as
coppice
for
and
scaffoldings
large
tracts
of
these
old
chestnut
groves
are
now
doomed
a
french
society
in
cosenza
so
they
tell
me
is
buying
them
up
for
the
extraction
out
of
their
bark
of
some
chemical
or
medicine
the
vine
still
flourishes
at
this
height
though
dwarfed
in
size
soon
the
oaks
begin
to
dominate
and
after
that
we
enter
into
the
third
and
highest
region
cf
the
pines
and
beeches
those
accustomed
to
the
stony
deserts
of
nearly
all
south
european
mountain
districts
will
find
these
woodlands
intensely
refreshing
their
inaccessibility
has
proved
their
salvation
up
to
a
short
time
ago
nearly
all
the
cattle
on
the
sila
like
the
land
itself
belongs
to
large
proprietors
these
gentlemen
are
for
the
most
part
invisible
they
inhabit
their
palaces
in
the
cities
and
the
very
name
of
the
sila
sends
a
cold
shudder
through
their
bones
their
revenues
are
collected
from
the
shepherds
by
agents
who
seem
to
do
their
work
very
conscientiously
i
once
observed
in
a
hut
a
small
fragment
of
the
skin
of
a
newly
killed
kid
the
wolf
had
devoured
the
beast
and
the
shepherd
was
keeping
this
to
prove
to
his
superior
the
agent
that
he
was
innocent
of
the
murder
there
was
something
naive
in
his
honesty
as
if
a
shepherd
could
not
eat
a
kid
as
well
as
any
wolf
and
keep
a
portion
of
its
skin
the
agent
no
doubt
would
hand
it
on
to
his
lord
by
way
of
and
another
time
i
saw
the
debris
of
a
goat
hanging
from
a
tree
it
was
the
wolf
again
the
boy
had
attached
these
remains
to
the
tree
in
order
that
all
who
passed
that
way
might
be
his
witnesses
if
necessary
that
the
animal
had
not
been
sold
underhand
you
may
still
find
the
legendary
shepherds
here
striplings
reclining
tegmine
in
the
best
theocritean
style
and
piping
wondrous
melodies
to
their
flocks
these
have
generally
come
up
for
the
summer
season
from
the
ionian
lowlands
or
you
may
encounter
yet
more
primitive
creatures
forest
boys
clad
in
leather
with
wild
eyes
and
matted
locks
that
take
an
elvish
delight
in
misdirecting
you
these
are
the
lucanians
of
old
they
bring
them
up
from
childhood
in
the
woods
among
the
shepherds
says
justinus
without
servants
and
even
without
any
clothes
to
cover
them
or
to
lie
upon
that
from
their
early
years
they
may
become
inured
to
hardiness
and
frugality
and
have
no
intercourse
with
the
city
they
live
upon
game
and
drink
nothing
but
water
or
milk
but
the
majority
of
modern
sila
shepherds
are
shrewd
fellows
of
middle
age
many
of
them
have
been
to
america
who
keep
strict
business
accounts
for
their
masters
of
every
ounce
of
cheese
and
butter
produced
the
local
cheese
which
cassiodorus
praises
in
one
of
his
letters
is
the
common
all
over
south
italy
the
butter
is
of
the
kind
which
has
been
humorously
but
quite
wrongly
described
by
various
travellers
although
the
old
wolves
are
shot
and
killed
by
spring
guns
and
dynamite
while
the
young
ones
are
caught
alive
in
steel
traps
and
other
appliances
their
numbers
are
still
formidable
enough
to
perturb
the
pastoral
folks
one
is
therefore
surprised
to
see
what
a
poor
breed
of
dogs
they
keep
scraggy
mongrels
that
run
for
their
lives
at
the
mere
sight
of
a
wolf
who
can
and
often
does
bite
them
into
two
pieces
with
one
snap
of
his
jaws
they
tell
me
that
there
is
a
government
reward
for
every
wolf
killed
but
it
is
seldom
paid
whoever
has
the
good
fortune
to
slay
one
of
these
beasts
carries
the
skin
as
proof
of
his
prowess
from
door
to
door
and
receives
a
small
present
everywhere
half
a
franc
or
a
cheese
or
a
glass
of
wine
the
goats
show
fight
and
therefore
the
wolf
prefers
sheep
shepherds
have
told
me
that
he
comes
up
to
them
and
then
fixing
his
teeth
in
the
wool
of
their
necks
pulls
them
onward
caressing
their
sides
with
his
tail
the
sheep
are
fascinated
with
his
gentle
manners
and
generally
allow
themselves
to
be
led
up
to
the
spot
he
has
selected
for
their
execution
the
truth
being
that
he
is
too
lazy
to
carry
them
if
he
can
possibly
avoid
it
he
will
promptly
kill
his
quarry
and
carry
its
carcase
downhill
on
the
rare
occasions
when
the
flocks
are
grazing
above
his
haunt
but
if
it
is
an
uphill
walk
they
must
be
good
enough
to
use
their
own
legs
incredible
stories
of
his
destructiveness
are
related
fortunately
human
beings
are
seldom
attacked
a
dog
or
a
pig
being
generally
forthcoming
when
the
usual
prey
is
not
to
be
found
yet
not
long
ago
a
sad
affair
occurred
a
attacked
a
small
boy
before
the
eyes
of
his
parents
who
pursued
him
powerless
to
help
the
head
and
arms
had
already
been
torn
off
before
a
shot
from
a
neighbour
despatched
the
monster
truly
a
great
family
displeasure
as
my
informant
styled
it
milo
of
croton
the
famous
athlete
is
the
most
renowned
victim
of
these
sila
wolves
tradition
has
it
that
relying
on
his
great
strength
he
tried
to
rend
asunder
a
mighty
log
of
wood
which
closed
however
and
caught
his
arms
in
its
grip
thus
helpless
he
was
devoured
alive
by
them
by
keeping
to
the
left
of
circilla
i
might
have
skirted
the
forest
of
gariglione
this
tract
lies
at
about
four
and
a
half
hours
distance
from
san
giovanni
i
found
it
some
years
ago
to
be
a
region
of
real
urwald
or
primary
jungle
there
was
nothing
like
it
to
my
knowledge
on
this
side
of
the
alps
nor
yet
in
the
alps
themselves
nothing
of
the
kind
nearer
than
russia
but
the
russian
jungles
apart
from
their
monotony
of
timber
foster
feelings
of
sadness
and
gloom
whereas
these
southern
ones
as
hehn
has
well
observed
are
full
of
a
luminous
beauty
their
darkest
recesses
being
enlivened
by
a
sense
of
benignant
mystery
gariglione
was
at
that
time
a
virgin
forest
untouched
by
the
hand
of
man
a
dusky
ridge
visible
from
afar
an
impenetrable
tangle
of
forest
trees
chiefest
among
them
being
the
garigli
quercus
cerris
whence
it
derives
its
name
as
well
as
thousands
of
pines
and
bearded
firs
and
all
that
hoary
indigenous
vegetation
struggling
out
of
the
moist
soil
wherein
their
progenitors
had
lain
decaying
time
out
of
mind
in
these
solitudes
if
anywhere
one
might
still
have
found
the
luzard
lynx
of
the
veracious
historian
or
that
squirrel
whose
calabrere
fur
i
strongly
suspect
came
from
russia
or
at
any
rate
the
shineth
in
the
footnote
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
is
a
commodity
being
still
collected
and
eaten
for
example
at
santo
stefano
in
aspramente
older
travellers
tell
us
that
it
used
to
be
exported
to
naples
and
kept
in
the
cellars
of
the
best
houses
for
the
enjoyment
of
its
fruit
sometimes
in
lumps
measuring
two
feet
in
diameter
which
being
soaked
in
water
produced
these
edible
fungi
a
stone
yielding
food
a
miracle
it
is
a
porous
tufa
adapted
presumably
for
sheltering
and
fecundating
vegetable
spores
a
little
pamphlet
by
professor
trotter
flora
montana
della
calabria
gives
some
idea
of
the
local
plants
and
contains
a
useful
bibliography
a
curious
feature
is
the
relative
abundance
of
boreal
and
forms
another
the
rapid
spread
of
anglica
which
is
probably
an
importation
well
i
am
glad
my
path
did
not
lead
me
to
gariglione
and
so
destroy
old
memories
of
the
place
for
the
domain
they
tell
me
has
been
sold
for
francs
to
a
german
company
its
primeval
silence
is
now
invaded
by
an
army
of
workmen
who
have
been
cutting
down
the
timber
as
fast
as
they
can
so
vanishes
another
fair
spot
from
earth
and
what
is
left
of
the
sila
once
these
forests
are
gone
not
even
the
charm
such
as
it
is
of
caithness
after
circilla
comes
the
watershed
that
separates
the
sila
grande
from
the
westerly
regions
of
sila
piccola
thenceforward
it
was
downhill
walking
at
first
through
forest
lands
then
across
verdant
stretches
bereft
of
timber
and
simmering
in
the
sunshine
the
peculiar
character
of
this
country
is
soon
revealed
ferociously
cloven
ravines
utterly
different
from
the
sila
grande
with
the
improvidence
of
the
true
traveller
i
had
consumed
my
stock
of
provisions
ere
reaching
the
town
of
taverna
after
a
march
of
nine
hours
or
thereabouts
a
place
of
this
size
and
renown
i
had
argued
would
surely
be
able
to
provide
a
meal
but
taverna
belies
its
name
the
only
tavern
discoverable
was
a
composite
hovel
half
half
whose
proprietor
disturbed
in
his
noonday
nap
stoutly
refused
to
produce
anything
eatable
and
there
i
stood
in
the
blazing
sunshine
famished
and
forthwith
the
strength
melted
out
of
my
bones
the
prospect
of
walking
to
catanzaro
so
alluring
with
a
full
stomach
faded
out
of
the
realm
of
possibility
and
it
seemed
a
special
dispensation
of
providence
when
at
my
lowest
ebb
of
vitality
a
small
carriage
suddenly
hove
in
sight
how
much
to
catanzaro
the
owner
eyed
me
critically
and
then
replied
in
english
you
can
pay
twenty
dollars
twenty
dollars
a
hundred
francs
but
it
is
useless
trying
to
bargain
with
an
their
time
is
too
valuable
a
dollar
a
mile
i
protested
that
so
you
be
damned
same
to
you
mister
and
he
drove
off
such
bold
defiance
of
fate
never
goes
unrewarded
a
cart
conveying
some
timber
overtook
me
shortly
afterwards
on
my
way
from
the
inhospitable
taverna
for
a
small
consideration
i
was
enabled
to
pass
the
burning
hours
of
the
afternoon
in
an
improvised
couch
among
its
load
of
boards
admiring
the
scenery
and
the
engineering
feats
that
have
carried
a
road
through
such
difficult
country
and
thinking
out
some
further
polite
remarks
to
be
addressed
to
my
friend
in
the
event
of
our
meeting
at
catanzaro
one
must
have
traversed
the
sila
in
order
to
appreciate
the
manifold
charms
of
the
mountain
town
i
have
revelled
in
them
since
my
arrival
but
it
has
one
irremediable
drawback
the
sea
lies
at
an
inconvenient
distance
it
takes
minutes
to
reach
the
shore
by
means
of
two
railways
in
whose
carriages
the
citizens
descend
after
wild
scrambles
for
places
packed
tight
as
sardines
in
the
sweltering
heat
only
a
genuine
enthusiast
will
undertake
the
trip
more
than
once
for
the
marina
itself
at
this
season
at
least
is
an
unappetizing
spot
a
sordid
agglomeration
of
houses
a
few
dirty
dust
swarms
of
flies
i
prefer
to
sleep
through
the
warm
hours
of
the
day
and
then
take
the
air
in
that
delightful
public
garden
which
by
the
way
has
already
become
too
small
for
the
increasing
population
at
its
entrance
stands
the
civic
museum
entrusted
just
now
to
the
care
of
a
quite
remarkably
ignorant
and
slatternly
woman
it
contains
two
rooms
whose
exhibits
are
smothered
in
dust
and
cobwebs
as
neglected
in
short
as
her
own
brats
that
sprawl
about
its
floor
i
enquired
whether
she
possessed
no
catalogue
to
show
where
the
objects
bearing
no
labels
had
been
found
a
catalogue
was
unnecessary
she
said
she
knew
everything
everything
and
everything
apparently
hailed
from
stromboli
the
tiriolo
helmet
the
greek
vases
all
the
rest
of
the
real
and
sham
treasures
of
this
establishment
they
were
all
discovered
at
stromboli
those
coins
whence
stromboli
noticing
some
neolithic
celts
similar
to
those
i
obtained
at
vaccarizza
i
would
gladly
have
learnt
their
place
of
origin
promptly
came
the
answer
stromboli
nonsense
my
good
woman
i
been
three
times
to
stromboli
it
is
an
island
of
black
stones
where
the
devil
has
a
house
and
such
things
are
not
found
there
of
course
she
meant
strangoli
the
ancient
petelia
this
vigorous
assertion
made
her
more
circumspect
thenceforward
everything
was
declared
to
come
from
the
province
provincia
it
was
safer
that
bad
picture
whence
dalla
provincia
have
you
really
no
catalogue
i
know
everything
and
this
broken
statue
whence
dalla
provincia
but
the
province
is
large
i
objected
so
it
is
large
and
old
i
have
also
revisited
tiriolo
once
celebrated
for
the
sepulchres
of
the
giants
greek
tombs
that
were
unearthed
here
and
latterly
for
a
certain
more
valuable
antiquarian
discovery
not
long
ago
it
was
a
considerable
undertaking
to
reach
this
little
place
but
nowadays
a
public
whirls
you
up
and
down
the
ravines
at
an
alarming
pace
and
will
deposit
you
within
a
few
hours
at
remote
cosenza
once
an
enormous
drive
it
is
the
same
all
over
modern
calabria
the
diligence
service
for
instance
that
used
to
take
fourteen
hours
from
san
giovanni
to
cosenza
has
been
replaced
by
motors
that
cover
the
distance
in
four
or
five
one
is
glad
to
save
time
but
this
new
element
of
mechanical
hurry
has
produced
a
corresponding
kind
of
traveller
a
creature
devoid
of
the
humanity
of
the
old
it
has
done
away
with
the
personal
note
of
conviviality
that
reigned
in
the
what
jocund
friendships
were
made
what
songs
and
tales
applauded
during
those
interminable
hours
in
the
lumbering
chaise
you
must
choose
sunday
for
tiriolo
on
account
of
the
girls
whose
pretty
faces
and
costumes
are
worth
coming
any
distance
to
see
a
good
proportion
of
them
have
the
fair
hair
which
seems
to
have
been
eliminated
in
other
parts
of
the
country
through
the
action
of
malaria
viewed
from
catanzaro
one
of
the
hills
of
tiriolo
looks
like
a
broken
volcanic
crater
it
is
a
limestone
ridge
decked
with
those
characteristic
flowers
like
which
you
will
vainly
seek
on
the
sila
out
of
the
ruins
of
some
massive
old
building
they
have
constructed
on
the
summit
a
lonely
fabric
that
would
touch
the
heart
of
maeterlinck
they
call
it
a
seismological
station
i
pity
the
people
that
have
to
depend
for
their
warnings
of
earthquakes
upon
the
outfit
of
a
place
like
this
i
could
see
no
signs
of
life
here
the
windows
were
broken
the
shutters
decaying
an
old
dangled
disconsolately
from
the
roof
it
looked
as
abandoned
as
any
old
tower
in
a
tale
there
is
a
noble
view
from
this
point
over
both
seas
and
into
the
riven
complexities
of
aspromonte
when
the
peak
is
not
veiled
in
mists
as
it
frequently
is
for
tiriolo
lies
on
the
watershed
there
to
quote
from
a
person
of
quality
where
the
apennine
is
drawn
into
so
narrow
a
point
that
the
which
descendeth
from
the
ridge
of
some
one
house
falleth
on
the
left
in
the
terrene
sea
and
on
the
right
into
the
adriatick
my
visits
to
the
provincial
museum
have
become
scandalously
frequent
during
the
last
few
days
i
can
not
keep
away
from
the
place
i
go
there
not
to
study
the
specimens
but
to
converse
with
their
keeper
the
woman
who
in
her
quiet
way
has
cast
a
sort
of
charm
over
me
our
relations
are
the
whispered
talk
of
the
town
i
am
suspected
of
matrimonial
designs
upon
a
poor
widow
with
the
ulterior
object
of
appropriating
the
cream
of
the
relics
under
her
care
regardless
of
the
perils
of
the
situation
i
persevere
for
the
sake
of
her
company
i
forswear
the
manifold
seductions
of
she
is
a
noteworthy
person
neither
vicious
nor
vulgar
but
simply
the
of
incompetence
her
dress
her
looks
her
children
her
manners
they
are
all
on
an
even
plane
with
her
spiritual
accomplishments
at
no
point
does
she
sink
or
rise
beyond
that
level
they
are
not
as
common
as
they
seem
to
be
these
harmoniously
inefficient
females
why
has
she
got
this
job
in
a
progressive
town
containing
so
many
folks
who
could
do
it
creditably
oh
that
is
simple
enough
she
needs
it
on
the
platform
of
the
reggio
station
long
before
the
earthquake
i
once
counted
five
and
other
railway
officials
swaggering
about
with
a
magnificent
air
of
incapacity
what
were
they
doing
nothing
whatever
they
were
like
this
woman
they
needed
a
job
we
are
in
a
patriarchal
country
work
is
pooled
it
is
given
not
to
those
who
can
do
it
best
but
to
those
who
need
it
most
given
too
on
pretexts
which
sometimes
strike
one
as
inadequate
not
to
say
recondite
so
the
in
a
certain
village
has
been
entrusted
to
a
cripple
utterly
unfit
for
the
business
why
because
his
maternal
is
serving
a
long
sentence
in
gaol
the
poor
family
must
be
helped
a
brawny
young
fellow
will
be
removed
from
a
boat
and
his
place
taken
by
some
tottering
old
peasant
who
has
never
handled
an
oar
why
the
old
man
nephew
has
married
again
the
family
must
be
helped
a
secretarial
appointment
was
specially
created
for
an
acquaintance
of
mine
who
could
barely
sign
his
own
name
for
the
obvious
reason
that
his
cousin
sister
was
rheumatic
one
must
help
that

a

i

delivered
the

days
alleging
as
unanswerable
argument
in
his
defence
that

somebody
seems
to
have
thought
so
at

i
have
never
beheld
the
enchantment
of
the
straits
of
messina
that
fata

under
certain
conditions
of
weather
phantasmagoric
palaces
of
wondrous
shape
are
cast
upon

waters
not
mirrored

standing

as
it
were

diaphanous
as
a

a
dominican
monk
and
correspondent
of
the
naples
academy
minasi
by

friend
of
sir

wrote
a
dissertation
upon
this
atmospheric
mockery
many
have
seen
and
described
it
among

the
apparition
is
coy
yet
there
are
pictures
of
it
in
an
article
in
la
lettura
by
vittorio
boccara
who
therein
refers
to
a
scientific
treatise
by
himself
on
the
subject
as
well
as
in
the
little
volume
da
reggio
a
metaponto
by
which
was
printed
at
gerace
some
years
ago
i
mention
these
writers
for
the
sake
of
any
one
who
luckier
than
myself
may
be
able
to
observe
this
phenomenon
and
become
interested
in
its
history
and
origin
the
chronicles
of
messina
record
the
scarcely
human
feats
of
the
diver
cola
pesce
nicholas
the
fish
the
dim
submarine
landscapes
of
the
straits
with
their
caves
and
tangled
forests
held
no
secrets
from
him
his
eyes
were
as
familiar
with
as
those
of
any
fish
some
think
that
the
legend
dates
from
frederick
ii
to
whom
he
brought
up
from
the
foaming
gulf
that
golden
goblet
which
has
been
immortalized
in
schiller
ballad
but
schneegans
says
there
are
norman
documents
that
speak
of
him
and
that
other
tale
according
to
which
he
took
to
his
watery
life
in
pursuit
of
some
beloved
maiden
who
had
been
swallowed
by
the
waves
makes
one
think
of
old
glaucus
as
his
prototype
many
are
the
fables
connected
with
his
name
but
the
most
portentous
is
this
one
day
during
his
subaqueous
wanderings
he
discovered
the
foundations
of
messina
they
were
insecure
the
city
rested
upon
three
columns
one
of
them
intact
another
quite
decayed
away
the
third
partially
corroded
and
soon
to
crumble
into
ruin
he
peered
up
from
his
blue
depths
and
in
a
fateful
couplet
of
verses
warned
the
townsmen
of
their
impending
doom
in
this
prophetic
utterance
ascribed
to
the
fabulous
cola
pesce
is
echoed
a
popular
apprehension
that
was
only
too
justified
muenter
one
of
a
band
of
travellers
who
explored
these
regions
after
the
earthquake
of
also
gave
voice
to
his
fears
that
messina
had
not
yet
experienced
the
full
measure
of
her
calamities
i
remember
a
night
in
september
of
a
sunday
night
fragrant
with
the
odours
of
withered
rosemary
and
cistus
and
fennel
that
streamed
in
aromatic
showers
from
the
scorched
heights
overhead
a
starlit
night
tranquil
and
calm
never
had
messina
appeared
so
attractive
to
me
arriving
there
generally
in
the
daytime
and
from
larger
and
sprightlier
centres
of
civilization
one
is
prone
to
notice
only
its
defects
but
night
especially
a
southern
night
has
a
wizard
touch
it
transforms
into
objects
of
mysterious
beauty
all
unsightly
things
or
hides
them
clean
away
while
the
nobler
works
of
man
those
facades
and
cornices
and
balconies
of
cunningly
wrought
iron
rise
up
under
its
enchantment
ethereal
as
the
palace
of
fairies
and
coming
as
i
then
did
from
the
of
calabria
this
place
with
its
broad
and
streets
its
glittering
cafés
and
demure
throng
of
evening
idlers
seemed
a
veritable
metropolis
a
with
deliberate
slowness
con
molto
sentimento
i
worked
my
way
to
the
familiar
restaurant
at
last
at
last
after
an
interminable
diet
of
hard
bread
onions
and
goat
cheese
i
was
to
enjoy
the
complicated
menu
mapped
out
weeks
beforehand
after
elaborate
consideration
and
balancing
of
merits
so
complicated
that
its
details
have
long
ago
lapsed
from
my
memory
i
recollect
only
the
a
local
speciality
and
as
crowning
glory
the
alla
siciliana
a
glacial
symphony
a
multicoloured
ice
of
commingling
flavours
which
requires
far
more
time
to
describe
than
to
devour
under
the
influence
of
this
sybaritic
fare
helped
down
with
a
crusted
bottle
of
calabrian
wine
your
sicilian
stuff
is
too
strong
for
me
too
straightforward
uncompromising
i
prefer
to
be
wheedled
out
of
my
faculties
by
inches
like
a
gentleman
under
this
genial
stimulus
my
extenuated
frame
was
definitely
restored
i
became
mellow
and
companionable
the
traveller
lot
i
finally
concluded
is
not
the
worst
on
earth
everything
was
as
it
should
be
as
for
messina
messina
was
unquestionably
a
pleasant
city
but
why
were
all
the
shops
shut
so
early
in
the
evening
these
sicilians
said
the
waiter
an
old
neapolitan
acquaintance
in
reply
to
my
enquiries
are
always
playing
some
game
they
are
pretending
to
be
englishmen
at
this
moment
they
have
the
obsession
on
the
brain
their
attacks
generally
last
a
fortnight
like
the
measles
poor
people
playing
at
being
englishmen
they
have
invented
a
new
game
now
those
that
are
left
of
them
they
are
living
in
dolls
houses
and
the
fit
is
likely
to
last
for
some
little
time
an
engineer
remarked
to
me
not
long
ago
among
the
ruins
this
this
wooden
shelter
has
an
interior
surface
area
of
less
than
thirty
square
metres
persons
men
women
and
children
have
been
living
and
sleeping
in
it
for
the
last
five
months
a
little
overcrowded
i
suggested
yes
some
of
them
are
beginning
to
talk
of
overcrowding
it
was
all
very
well
in
the
winter
months
but
when
august
comes
well
we
shall
see
no
prophetic
visions
of
the
messina
of
with
its
minute
sheds
perched
among
a
wilderness
of
ruins
and
haunted
by
scared
shadows
in
sable
vestments
of
mourning
arose
in
my
mind
that
evening
as
i
sat
at
the
little
marble
table
sipping
my
coffee
overroasted
like
all
italian
coffee
by
exactly
two
minutes
and
puffing
contentedly
at
my
cigar
while
the
sober
crowd
floated
hither
and
thither
before
my
eyes
yes
everything
was
as
it
should
be
and
yet
what
a
chance
what
a
chance
for
some
god
in
this
age
of
unbelief
to
establish
his
rule
over
mankind
on
the
firm
foundations
of
faith
we
are
always
complaining
nowadays
of
an
abatement
of
religious
feeling
how
easy
for
such
a
one
to
send
down
an
isaiah
to
foretell
the
hour
of
the
coming
catastrophe
and
thus
save
those
of
its
victims
who
were
disposed
to
hearken
to
the
warning
voice
to
reanimate
the
flagging
zeal
of
worshippers
to
straighten
doubts
and
segregate
the
sheep
from
the
goats
truly
he
moves
in
a
mysterious
way
for
no
divine
message
came
the
just
were
entombed
with
the
unjust
amid
a
considerable
deal
of
telegraphing
and
a
few
days
after
the
disaster
the
catholic
papers
explained
matters
by
saying
that
the
people
of
messina
had
not
loved
their
madonna
sufficiently
well
but
she
loved
them
none
the
less
and
sent
the
earthquake
as
an
admonishment
rather
a
robust
method
of
conciliating
their
affection
not
exactly
the
in
modo
but
if
genuine
prophets
can
only
flourish
among
the
malarious
willow
swamps
of
old
babylon
and
improbable
spots
we
might
at
least
have
expected
better
things
of
our
modern
spiritualists
why
should
their
apparitions
content
themselves
with
announcing
the
decease
at
the
antipodes
of
profoundly
uninteresting
relatives
alas
i
begin
to
perceive
that
spirits
of
the
right
kind
of
the
useful
kind
have
yet
to
be
discovered
our
ghosts
are
like
seismographs
they
chronicle
the
event
after
it
has
happened
now
what
we
want
is
the
signore
smokes
and
smokes
and
smokes
why
not
take
the
tram
and
listen
to
the
municipal
music
in
the
gardens
music
gardens
an
excellent
suggestion
gennarino
even
as
a
small
italian
town
would
be
incomplete
without
its
piazza
where
streets
converge
and
commercial
pulses
beat
their
liveliest
measure
so
every
larger
one
contrives
to
possess
a
public
garden
for
the
evening
disport
of
its
citizens
being
the
true
life
of
the
south
charming
they
are
most
of
them
none
more
delectable
than
that
of
old
messina
a
spacious
pleasaunce
decked
out
with
trim
palms
and
and
labyrinthine
walks
freshly
watered
and
cooled
that
evening
by
stealthy
breezes
from
the
sea
the
grounds
were
festively
illuminated
and
as
i
sat
down
near
the
bandstand
and
watched
the
folk
meandering
to
and
fro
i
calculated
that
no
fewer
than
thirty
thousand
persons
were
abroad
taking
their
pleasure
under
the
trees
in
the
bland
air
of
evening
an
orderly
crowd
we
may
smile
when
they
tell
us
that
these
people
will
stint
themselves
of
the
necessities
of
life
in
order
to
wear
fine
clothes
but
the
effect
for
an
outsider
is
all
that
it
should
be
for
the
rest
the
very
urchins
gambolling
about
had
an
air
of
happy
prosperity
different
from
the
squalor
of
the
north
with
its
pinched
white
faces
its
and
and
how
well
the
sensuous
italian
strains
accord
with
such
an
hour
and
scene
they
were
playing
if
i
remember
rightly
the
aida
other
items
followed
later
more
ambitious
ones
a
hungarian
rhapsody
berlioz
a
selection
from
wagner
filosofica
said
my
neighbour
alluding
to
the
german
composer
he
was
a
spare
man
of
about
sixty
a
sunburnt
military
countenance
seamed
by
lines
of
suffering
va
in
sicilia
wo
do
in
this
country
not
that
we
fail
to
appreciate
your
great
thinkers
he
added
we
read
and
admire
your
schopenhauer
your
spencer
they
give
passable
representations
of
wagner
in
naples
but
the
climate
precisely
i
have
travelled
sir
and
knowing
your
berlin
and
london
and
boston
have
been
able
to
observe
how
ill
our
italian
architecture
looks
under
your
grey
skies
how
ill
our
music
sounds
among
the
complex
appliances
of
your
artificial
life
it
has
made
you
earnest
this
climate
of
yours
and
prone
to
take
earnestly
your
very
pastimes
music
for
us
has
remained
what
it
was
in
the
golden
age
an
unburdening
of
the
soul
on
a
summer
night
they
play
well
these
fellows
palermo
too
has
a
respectable
band
oh
a
little
too
fast
that
the
signore
is
a
musician
a
but
i
delight
in
music
and
i
beguiled
myself
with
the
fiddle
as
a
youngster
nowadays
look
here
and
he
extended
his
hand
it
was
crippled
rheumatism
i
have
it
here
and
here
pointing
to
various
regions
of
his
body
here
ah
these
doctors
the
baths
i
have
taken
the
medicines
the
ointments
the
embrocations
a
perfect
pharmacopceia
i
can
hardly
crawl
now
and
without
the
help
of
these
two
devoted
boys
even
this
harmless
little
diversion
would
have
been
denied
me
my
nephews
orphans
he
added
observing
the
direction
of
my
glance
they
sat
on
his
other
side
handsome
lads
who
spoke
neither
too
much
nor
too
little
every
now
and
then
they
rose
with
one
accord
and
strolled
among
the
surging
crowd
to
stretch
their
legs
returning
after
five
minutes
to
their
uncle
side
his
eyes
always
followed
their
movements
my
young
brother
had
he
lived
would
have
made
men
of
them
he
once
observed
the
images
revive
curiously
pertinacious
with
dim
lapses
and
gulfs
i
can
see
them
still
the
two
boys
their
grave
demeanour
belied
by
mobile
lips
and
mischievous
fair
curls
of
northern
ancestry
the
other
leaning
forward
intent
upon
the
music
and
caressing
his
moustache
with
bent
fingers
upon
which
glittered
a
jewel
set
in
massive
gold
some
scarab
or
intaglio
the
spoil
of
old
magna
graecia
his
conversation
during
the
intervals
moved
among
the
accepted
formulas
of
cosmopolitanism
with
easy
flow
quickened
at
times
by
the
individual
emphasis
of
a
man
who
can
forsake
conventional
tracks
and
think
for
himself
among
other
things
he
had
contrived
an
original
project
for
reviving
the
lemon
industry
of
his
country
which
though
it
involved
a
few
tariff
modifications
a
mere
detail
struck
me
as
amazingly
effective
and
ingenious
the
local
deputy
it
seems
shared
my
view
for
he
had
undertaken
to
bring
it
before
the
notice
of
parliament
what
was
it
i
have
forgotten
so
we
discussed
the
world
while
the
music
played
under
the
starlit
southern
night
it
must
have
been
midnight
ere
a
final
frenzied
galop
on
the
part
of
the
indefatigable
band
announced
the
close
of
the
entertainment
i
walked
a
few
paces
beside
the
lame
proprietor
who
supported
on
the
arms
of
his
nephews
made
his
way
to
the
spot
where
the
cabs
were
waiting
his
rheumatism
he
explained
obliging
him
to
drive
how
he
had
enjoyed
walking
as
a
youth
and
what
pleasure
it
would
now
have
given
him
to
protract
during
a
promenade
to
my
hotel
our
delightful
conversation
but
infirmities
teach
us
to
curtail
our
pleasures
and
many
things
that
seem
natural
to
man
bodily
configuration
are
found
to
be
unattainable
he
seldom
left
his
rooms
the
stairs
the
diabolical
stairs
would
i
at
least
accept
his
card
and
rest
assured
how
gladly
he
would
receive
me
and
do
all
in
his
power
to
make
my
stay
agreeable
that
card
has
gone
the
way
of
numberless
others
which
the
traveller
in
southern
europe
gathers
about
him
i
have
also
forgotten
the
old
name
but
the
in
which
he
lived
bore
a
certain
historical
title
which
happened
to
be
very
familiar
to
me
i
remember
wondering
how
it
came
to
reach
messina
in
the
olden
days
of
course
the
days
of
splendour
will
they
ever
return
it
struck
me
that
the
sufferings
of
the
survivors
would
be
alleviated
if
all
the
sheds
in
which
they
are
living
could
be
painted
white
or
in
order
to
protect
them
as
far
as
possible
from
the
burning
rays
of
the
sun
i
mentioned
the
idea
to
an
overseer
we
are
painting
as
fast
as
we
can
he
replied
an
expensive
matter
however
the
villagio
elena
alone
has
cost
us
in
this
respect
twenty
thousand
francs
with
the
greatest
economy
this
will
give
some
notion
of
the
scale
on
which
things
have
to
be
done
the
settlement
in
question
contains
some
two
hundred
sheds
two
hundred
out
of
over
ten
thousand
but
i
was
alluding
not
to
these
groups
of
hygienic
bungalows
erected
by
public
munificence
and
supplied
with
schools
laboratories
orphanages
hospitals
and
all
that
can
make
life
endurable
but
to
the
others
those
which
the
refugees
built
for
themselves
hovels
patched
together
with
ropes
petroleum
cans
and
miscellaneous
odds
and
ends
a
coat
of
whitewash
at
least
inside
and
out
i
was
thinking
too
of
those
still
stranger
dwellings
the
disused
railway
trucks
which
the
government
has
placed
at
the
disposal
of
homeless
families
at
many
stations
along
the
line
may
be
seen
strings
of
these
picturesque
wigwams
crowded
with
poor
folk
who
have
installed
themselves
within
apparently
for
ever
they
are
cultivating
their
favourite
flowers
and
herbs
in
gaudy
rows
along
the
wooden
platforms
of
the
carriages
the
little
children
all
dressed
in
black
play
about
in
the
shade
underneath
the
people
will
suffer
in
these
narrow
tenements
under
the
fierce
southern
sun
after
their
cool
courtyards
and
chambers
there
will
be
diseases
too
typhoids
from
the
disturbed
drainage
and
insufficient
eye
troubles
caused
by
the
swarms
of
flies
and
tons
of
accumulated
dust
the
ruins
are
also
overrun
with
hordes
of
mangy
cats
and
dogs
which
ought
to
be
exterminated
without
delay
if
as
seems
likely
those
rudely
improvised
sheds
are
to
be
inhabited
indefinitely
we
may
look
forward
to
an
interesting
phenomenon
a
reversion
to
a
corresponding
type
of
man
the
lack
of
the
most
ordinary
appliances
of
civilization
such
as
linen
and
cooking
utensils
will
reduce
them
to
the
condition
of
savages
who
view
these
things
with
indifference
or
simple
curiosity
they
will
forget
that
they
ever
had
any
use
for
them
and
life
in
these
huts
where
human
beings
are
herded
together
after
the
manner
of
beasts
one
might
almost
say
in
like
the
fragments
of
a
mosaic
pavement
can
not
but
be
harmful
to
the
development
of
growing
children
the
calabrians
i
was
told
distinguished
themselves
by
unearthly
ferocity
reggio
was
given
over
to
a
legion
of
fiends
that
descended
from
the
heights
during
the
week
of
confusion
they
tore
the
rings
and
brooches
off
the
dead
said
a
young
officiai
to
me
they
strangled
the
wounded
and
dying
in
order
to
despoil
them
more
comfortably
here
and
at
messina
the
mutilated
corpses
were
past
computation
but
the
calabrians
were
the
worst
vampires
offspring
of
night
and
chaos
so
dolomieu
speaking
of
the
incroyable
des
which
accompanied
the
earthquake
of
recounts
the
case
of
a
householder
of
polistena
who
was
pinned
down
under
some
masonry
his
legs
emerging
out
of
the
ruins
his
servant
came
and
took
the
silver
buckles
off
his
shoes
and
then
fled
without
attempting
to
free
him
we
have
seen
something
of
this
kind
more
recently
at
san
francisco
after
despoiling
the
corpses
they
ransacked
the
dwellings
five
thousand
beds
sir
were
carried
up
from
reggio
into
the
mountains
five
thousand
beds
dìo
it
seems
a
considerable
number
a
young
fellow
one
of
the
survivors
attached
himself
to
me
in
the
capacity
of
guide
through
the
ruins
of
reggio
he
wore
the
characteristic
earthquake
look
a
dazed
and
bewildered
expression
of
countenance
he
spoke
in
a
singularly
deliberate
manner
knowing
the
country
i
was
soon
bending
my
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
cemetery
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
the
exquisite
view
from
those
windswept
heights
and
to
breathe
more
freely
after
the
dust
and
desolation
of
the
lower
parts
this
is
in
the
same
state
as
that
of
messina
once
the
pride
of
its
citizens
the
insane
frolic
of
nature
has
not
respected
the
slumber
of
the
dead
or
their
commemorative
shrines
it
has
made
a
mockery
of
the
place
twisting
the
solemn
monuments
into
repulsive
and
irreverential
shapes
but
who
can
recount
the
freaks
of
stone
and
iron
during
those
moments
the
escapes
my
companion
case
was
miraculous
enough
awakened
from
sleep
with
the
first
shock
he
saw
by
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
which
burns
in
all
their
bedrooms
the
wall
at
his
bedside
weirdly
gaping
asunder
he
darted
to
reach
the
opening
but
it
closed
again
and
caught
his
arm
in
a
stony
grip
hours
seemed
to
pass
the
pain
was
past
enduring
then
the
kindly
cleft
yawned
once
more
allowing
him
to
jump
into
the
garden
below
simultaneously
he
heard
a
crash
as
the
inner
rooms
of
the
house
fell
then
climbed
aloft
and
for
four
days
wandered
among
the
bleak
wet
hills
thousands
were
in
the
same
plight
i
asked
what
he
found
to
eat
we
all
did
you
could
not
touch
property
a
single
orange
and
they
would
have
killed
you
grass
he
bore
a
name
renowned
in
the
past
but
his
home
being
turned
into
a
under
which
his
money
papers
and
furniture
his
two
parents
and
brothers
are
still
lying
he
now
gains
a
livelihood
by
carrying
vegetables
and
fruit
from
the
harbour
to
the
collection
of
sheds
honoured
by
the
name
of
market
later
in
the
day
we
happened
to
walk
past
the
very
mansion
which
lies
near
the
quay
here
is
my
house
and
my
family
he
remarked
indicating
with
a
gesture
of
antique
resignation
a
pile
of
wreckage
hard
by
among
the
ruins
there
sat
a
young
woman
with
dishevelled
hair
singing
rapturously
her
husband
was
crushed
to
death
he
said
and
it
unhinged
her
wits
strange
is
it
not
sir
they
used
to
fight
like
fiends
and
now
she
sings
to
him
night
and
day
to
come
back
love
so
the
greeks
fabled
was
the
child
of
chaos
in
this
part
of
the
town
stands
the
civic
museum
which
all
readers
of
gissing
ionian
sea
will
remember
as
the
closing
note
of
those
harmonious
pages
it
is
shattered
like
everything
else
that
he
visited
in
reggio
like
the
hotel
where
he
lodged
like
the
cathedral
whose
proud
superscription
devenimus
impressed
him
so
deeply
like
that
singular
bit
of
advanced
civilization
which
gave
me
an
odd
sense
of
having
strayed
into
the
world
of
those
romancers
who
forecast
the
future
a
public
of
tasteful
architecture
set
in
a
grove
of
lemon
trees
and
palms
suggesting
the
dreamy
ideal
of
some
reformer
whose
palate
shrinks
from
vegetarianism
we
went
the
round
of
all
these
places
not
forgetting
the
house
which
bears
the
tablet
commemorating
the
death
of
a
young
soldier
who
fell
fighting
against
the
bourbons
from
its
contorted
iron
balcony
there
hangs
a
rope
by
which
the
inmates
may
have
tried
to
let
themselves
down
a
friend
of
mine
baron
c
of
stilo
is
a
member
of
that
same
patriotic
family
and
gave
me
the
following
strange
account
he
was
absent
from
reggio
at
the
time
of
the
catastrophe
but
three
others
of
them
were
staying
there
on
the
first
shock
they
rushed
together
into
one
room
the
floor
gave
way
and
they
suddenly
found
themselves
sitting
in
their
which
happened
to
be
placed
exactly
below
them
they
escaped
with
a
few
cuts
and
bruises
an
inscription
on
a
neighbouring
ruin
runs
to
the
effect
that
the
having
been
severely
damaged
in
the
earthquake
owner
had
rebuilt
it
on
lines
calculated
to
defy
future
shattering
whether
he
would
rebuild
it
yet
again
nevertheless
there
seems
to
be
some
chance
for
the
revival
of
reggio
its
prognosis
is
not
utterly
hopeless
but
messina
is
in
desperate
case
that
haughty
with
its
long
line
of
imposing
edifices
imagine
a
painted
theatre
decoration
of
cardboard
through
which
some
sportive
behemoth
has
been
jumping
with
frantic
glee
there
you
have
it
and
within
all
is
desolation
the
wreckage
reaches
to
the
windows
you
must
clamber
over
it
as
best
you
can
what
an
deposit
for
future
generations
for
the
crafty
antiquarian
who
deciphers
the
history
of
mankind
out
of
and
deformed
heaps
of
forgotten
trash
the
whole
social
life
of
the
citizens
their
arts
domestic
economy
and
pastimes
lies
embedded
in
that
rubbish
a
musical
race
he
will
conclude
observing
the
number
of
decayed
pianofortes
guitars
and
mandolines
the
climate
of
messina
he
will
further
arene
must
have
been
a
wet
one
inasmuch
as
there
are
umbrellas
everywhere
standing
upright
among
the
debris
leaning
all
forlorn
against
the
ruins
or
peering
dismally
from
under
them
it
rained
much
during
those
awful
days
and
umbrellas
were
at
a
premium
yet
fifty
of
them
would
not
have
purchased
a
loaf
of
bread
it
was
goethe
who
speaking
of
pompeii
said
that
of
the
many
catastrophes
which
have
afflicted
mankind
few
have
given
greater
pleasure
to
posterity
the
same
will
never
be
said
of
messina
whose
relics
for
the
most
part
are
squalid
and
mean
the
german
poet
by
the
way
visited
this
town
shortly
after
the
disaster
of
and
describes
its
words
whose
very
sound
is
suggestive
of
shatterings
and
dislocations
nevertheless
the
place
revived
again
but
what
was
a
mere
rehearsal
an
amateur
performance
wandering
about
in
this
world
of
ghosts
i
passed
the
old
restaurant
where
the
had
once
tasted
so
good
an
accumulation
of
stones
and
mortar
and
reached
the
cathedral
it
is
laid
low
all
save
the
gargantuan
mosaic
figures
that
stare
down
from
behind
the
altar
in
futile
benediction
of
chaos
inane
terrific
this
then
is
the
house
of
that
feudal
lady
of
the
in
re
who
sent
an
earthquake
and
called
it
love
womanlike
she
doted
on
gold
and
precious
stones
and
they
recovered
her
fabulous
hoard
together
with
a
copy
of
a
latin
letter
she
sent
to
the
christians
of
messina
by
the
hand
of
saint
paul
and
not
long
afterwards
how
came
it
to
pass
my
steps
were
guided
amid
that
wilderness
towards
a
narrow
street
containing
the
ruins
of
a
that
bore
on
a
tablet
over
the
ample
doorway
an
inscription
which
arrested
my
attention
it
was
an
historical
title
familiar
to
me
and
forthwith
a
train
of
memories
slumbering
in
the
caverns
of
my
mind
was
ignited
yes
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
the
old
proprietor
and
his
nephews
he
of
the
municipal
gardens
i
wondered
how
they
had
met
their
fate
on
the
chill
wintry
morning
for
assuredly
in
that
restricted
space
not
a
soul
can
have
escaped
alive
the
wreckage
hitherto
undisturbed
still
covered
their
remains
and
remembering
the
old
man
and
his
humane
converse
that
evening
under
the
trees
the
true
meaning
of
the
catastrophe
began
to
disentangle
itself
from
accidental
and
superficial
aspects
for
i
confess
that
the
massacre
of
a
myriad
chinamen
leaves
me
cool
and
between
such
creatures
and
ourselves
there
is
hardly
more
than
the
frail
bond
of
a
common
descent
from
the
ape
they
are
altogether
too
remote
for
our
narrow
i
would
as
soon
shed
tears
over
the
lost
pleiad
but
these
others
are
our
spiritual
cousins
we
have
deep
roots
in
this
warm
soil
of
italy
which
brought
forth
a
goodly
tithe
of
what
is
best
in
our
own
lives

i
thought
of
the
two

their
decent
limbs
all
distorted
and
mangled
under
a
heap
of
foul
rubbish
waiting
for
a
brutal
disinterment
and
a
nameless
grave
this
is
no
legitimate
death
this
murderous
violation
of
life
how
inconceivably
hateful
is
such
a
and
all
that
follows
after
to
picture
a
fair
young
body
that
divine
instrument
of
joy
crushed
into
an
unsightly
heap
once
loved
now
loathed
of
all
men
and
thrust
at
last
with
abhorrence
into
some
common
festering
pit
of
abominations
the
northern
type
a
mighty
bond
again
a
tie
of
blood
this
time
between
our
race
and
those
rulers
of
the
south
whose
exploits
in
this
land
of
orange
and
myrtle
surpassed
the
dreamings
of
romance
strange
to
reflect
that
without
the
ephemeral
friendship
of
that
evening
messina
of
might
have
represented
to
my
mind
a
mere
spectacle
the
hecatomb
of
its
inhabitants
extorting
little
more
than
a
conventional
sigh
so
it
is
the
human
heart
has
been
constructed
on
somewhat
ungenerous
lines
moralists
if
any
still
exist
on
earth
may
generalize
with
eloquence
from
the
masses
but
our
poets
have
long
ago
succumbed
to
the
pathos
of
single
happenings
the
very
angels
of
heaven
they
say
take
more
joy
in
one
sinner
that
repenteth
than
in
a
hundred
righteous
which
duly
apprehended
is
only
an
application
of
the
same
illiberal
principle
a
rope
of
knotted
together
dangled
from
one
of
the

end
swaying
in
at
the
height
of
the
second
floor
many
of
them

at

a
desperate
expedient
of
escape
some
pots
of
geranium
and
cactus
sadly
flowering
adorned
the
other
windows
whose
glass
panes
were
unbroken
but
for
the
ominous
sunlight
pouring
through
them
from
the
building
looked
fairly
intact
on
this
outer
side
its
ponderous
gateway
however
through
which
i
had
hoped
to
enter
was
choked
up
by
internal
debris
and
i
was
obliged
to
climb
with
some
little
trouble
to
the
rear
of
the
house
if
a
titanic
blade
had
sheared
through
the
lengthwise
the
thing
could
not
have
been
done
more
neatly
the
whole
interior
had
gone
down
save
a
portion
of
the
rooms
abutting
on
the
these
were
literally
cut
in
half
so
as
to
display
an
ideal
section
of
domestic
architecture
the
house
with
its
inmates
and
all
it
contained
was
lying
among
the
wreckage
within
under
my
feet
masonry
mostly
entire
fragments
of
wall
interspersed
with
crumbling
mortar
and
convulsed
iron
girders
that
writhed
over
the
surface
or
plunged
sullenly
into
the
depths
fetid
rents
and
gullies
in
between
their
flanks
affording
glimpses
of
broken
vases
candelabras
hats
bottles
birdcages
brass
pipes
sofas
tablecloths
and
all
the
paltry
paraphernalia
of
everyday
life
no
attempt
at
stratification
horizontal
vertical
or
inclined
it
was
as
if
the
objects
had
been
thrown
up
by
some
playful
volcano

allowed
to
settle

they
pleased

me
of

existence
of

endeavoured
to
reconstruct
the

found
it

the

of

lately
been
eclipsed
by
those
of

infested

defying
the

had
he

in

fastnesses
but
he
wandered
away
wishful
to
leave
italy
for
good
and

and
was
captured
far
from
his
home
by
some
policemen
who
were
looking
for

man
and
who
nearly
fainted
when

pronounced
his

trial

permitted
as
far
as

early
next

i
would
climb
the
summit
and
descend
to
the

of

it
seemed
a
reasonable
programme
all
this
tyrrhenian

badly
shattered

more
so
than
the
southern

but
the
scenery
is
finer
there
is
nothing
on
that
side
to
compare
with
the
views
from
nicastro
or
or
sant

near

it
is
also
more
smiling
more
fertile
and
far
less
malarious
not
that
cultivation
of
the

implies
absence
of
malaria
nothing
is
a
commoner
mistake
the

is
not

it

malaria

go
uncommonly
well
together
the
miserable
loves
the
wells
that
are
sunk
for
the
watering
of
the
immense
orange
and
lemon
plantations
in
the
reggio
district
it
displays
a
perverse
predilection
for
the
minute
puddles
left
by
the
artificial
irrigation
of
the
fields
that
are
covered
with
fruit
and
vegetables
this
artificial
watering
in
fact
seems
to
be
partly
responsible
for
the
spread
of
the
disease
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
custom
goes
back
into
remote
antiquity
for
the
climate
used
to
be
moister
and
could
dispense
with
these
practices
certain
products
once
grown
in
calabria
no
longer
thrive
there
on
account
of
the
increased
dryness
and
lack
of
rainfall
but
there
are
some
deadly
regions
even
along
this
tyrrhenian
shore
such
is
the
plain
of
maida
for
instance
where
stood
not
long
ago
the

of

gioia
is
so
malarious
that
in

every
one
of
the
inhabitants
who
can
afford
the
price
of
a
ticket
goes
by
the
evening
train
to
palmato
sleep
there
you
will
do
well
by
the
way
to
see
something
of
the
oil
industry
of
palmi
if
time
permits
in
good
years
quintals
of
olive
oil
are
manufactured
in
the
regions
of
which
it
is
the
commercial
centre
not
long
ago
before
modern
methods
of
refining
were
introduced
most
of
this
oil
was
exported
to
russia
to
be
burned
in
holy
lamps
nowadays
it
goes
for
the
most
part
to
lucca
to
be
adulterated
for
foreign
markets
the
celebrated
lucca
oil
which
the
simple
englishman
regards
as
pure
only
the
finest
quality
is
sent
elsewhere
to
nice
from
gioia
there
runs
a
postal
diligence
once
a
day
to
delianuova
of
which
i
might
have
availed
myself
had
i
not
preferred
to
traverse
the
country
on
foot
the
journey
from
reggio
to
bagnara
on
this
fair
summer
morning
along
the
rippling
mediterranean
was
short
enough
but
sufficiently
long
to
let
me
overhear
the
following
conversation
what
a
lovely
sea
it
is
good
after
all
to
take
three
or
four
baths
a
year
what
think
you
i
no
for
thirteen
years
i
have
taken
no
baths
but
they
are
considered
good
for
children
the
calamities
that
bagnara
has
suffered
in
the
past
have
been
so
numerous
so
fierce
and
so
varied
that
properly
speaking
the
town
has
no
right
to
exist
any
longer
it
has
enjoyed
more
than
its
full
share
of
earthquakes
having
been
shaken
to
the
ground
over
and
over
again
sir
william
hamilton
reports
that
persons
were
killed
in
that
of
the
horrors
of
war
too
have
not
spared
it
and
a
certain
modern
exploit
of
the
british
arms
here
strikes
me
as
so
instructive
that
i
would
gladly
extract
it
from
grant
adventures
of
an
were
it
not
too
long
to
transcribe
and
far
too
good
to
abbreviate
a
characteristic
story
further
is
told
of
the
methods
of
general
manhes
at
bagnara
it
may
well
be
an
exaggeration
when
they
say
that
the
entire
road
from
reggio
to
naples
was
lined
with
the
heads
of
decapitated
brigands
be
that
as
it
may
it
stands
to
reason
that
bagnara
as
befits
an
important
place
was
to
be
provided
with
an
appropriate
display
of
these
trophies
the
heads
were
exhibited
in
baskets
with
strict
injunctions
to
the
authorities
that
they
were
not
to
be
touched
seeing
that
they
served
not
only
for
decorative
but
also
moral
purposes
as
examples
imagine
therefore
the
general
feelings
on
being
told
that
one
of
these
heads
had
been
stolen
stolen
probably
by
some
pious
relative
of
the
deceased
rascal
who
wished
to
give
the
relic
a
decent
christian
burial
that
rather
awkward
he
said
quietly
musing
but
of
course
the
specimen
must
be
replaced
let
me
see
suppose
we
put
the
head
of
the
mayor
of
bagnara
into
the
vacant
basket
shall
we
yes
we
have
the
mayor
it
will
make
him
more
careful
in
future
and
within
half
an
hour
the
basket
was
filled
once
more
there
was
a
little
hitch
in
starting
from
bagnara
from
the
windings
of
the
as
portrayed
by
the
map
i
guessed
that
there
must
be
a
number
of
short
cuts
into
the
uplands
at
the
back
of
the
town
undiscoverable
to
myself
which
would
greatly
shorten
the
journey
besides
there
was
my
small
bag
to
be
carried
a
porter
familiar
with
the
tracks
was
plainly
required
and
soon
enough
i
found
a
number
of
lusty
youths
leaning
against
a
wall
and
doing
nothing
in
particular
yes
they
would
accompany
me
they
said
the
whole
lot
of
them
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
and
my
bag
i
asked
a
bag
to
be
carried
then
we
must
get
a
woman
they
unearthed
a
nondescript
female
who
undertook
to
bear
the
burden
as
far
as
sinopoli
for
a
reasonable
consideration
so
far
good
but
as
we
proceeded
the
boys
began
to
drop
off
till
only
a
single
one
was
left
and
then
the
woman
suddenly
vanished
down
a
side
street
declaring
that
she
must
change
her
clothes
we
waited
for
of
an
hour
in
the
glaring
dust
of
the
turnpike
she
never
emerged
again
and
the
remaining
boy
stoutly
refused
to
handle
her
load
no
he
declared
she
must
carry
the
bag
and
i
will
keep
you
company
the
precious
morning
hours
were
wearing
away
and
here
we
stood
idly
by
the
side
of
the
road
it
never
struck
me
that
the
time
might
have
been
profitably
employed
in
paying
a
flying
visit
to
one
of
the
most
sacred
objects
in
calabria
and
possibly
in
the
whole
world
one
which
signor
marcene
describes
as
reposing
at
bagnara
in
a
rich
reliquary
the
authentic
hat
of
the
mother
of
god
a
lady
tourist
would
not
have
missed
this
chance
of
studying
the
fashions
of
those
days
footnote
see
next
chapter
finally
in
desperation
i
snatched
up
the
wretched
luggage
and
poured
my
griefs
with
unwonted
eloquence
into
the
ears
of
a
man
driving
a
down
the
road
so
much
was
he
moved
that
he
peremptorily
ordered
his
son
to
conduct
me
then
and
there
to
sinopoli
to
carry
the
bag
and
claim
one
franc
by
way
of
payment
the
little
man
tumbled
off
the
cart
rather
reluctantly
away
with
you
cried
the
stern
parent
and
we
began
the
long
march
climbing
uphill
in
the
blazing
sunshine
winding
later
on
through
shady
chestnut
woods
and
across
broad
tracts
of
cultivated
land
it
was
plain
that
the
task
was
beyond
his
powers
and
when
we
had
reached
a
spot
where
the
new
village
of
sant
eufemia
was
visible
it
is
built
entirely
of
wooden
shelters
the
stone
town
was
greatly
shaken
in
the
late
earthquake
he
was
obliged
to
halt
and
thenceforward
stumbled
slowly
into
the
place
there
he
deposited
the
bag
on
the
ground
and
faced
me
squarely
no
more
of
this
he
said
concentrating
every
ounce
of
his
virility
into
a
look
of
uncompromising
defiance
then
i
shall
not
pay
you
a
single
farthing
my
son
and
moreover
i
will
tell
your
father
you
know
what
he
commanded
to
sinopoli
this
is
only
sant
eufemia
unless
you
will
tell
my
father
unless
unless
you
discover
some
one
who
will
carry
the
bag
not
only
to
sinopoli
but
as
far
as
delianuova
i
was
not
in
the
mood
for
repeating
the
experiences
of
the
morning
it
is
difficult
but
we
will
try
he
went
in
search
and
returned
anon
with
a
slender
lad
of
unusual
comeliness
an
earthquake
orphan
this
big
one
he
explained
walks
wherever
you
please
and
carries
whatever
you
give
him
and
you
will
pay
him
nothing
at
all
unless
he
deserves
it
such
is
the
arrangement
are
you
content
you
have
acted
like
a
man
the
earthquake
survivor
set
off
at
a
swinging
pace
and
we
soon
reached
sinopoli
new
sinopoli
the
older
settlement
lies
at
a
considerable
distance
midday
was
past
and
the
long
main
street
of
the
town
a
former
fief
of
the
terrible
ruffo
family
stood
deserted
in
the
trembling
heat
none
the
less
there
was
sufficient
liveliness
within
the
houses
the
whole
place
seemed
in
a
state
of
jollification
it
was
sunday
the
orphan
explained
the
country
was
duller
than
usual
however
because
of
the
high
price
of
wine
there
had
been
no
murders
to
speak
of
no
not
for
a
long
time
past
but
the
vintage
of
this
year
he
added
promises
well
and
life
will
soon
become
normal
again
the
mule
track
from
here
to
delianuova
traverses
some
pretty
scenery
both
wild
and
pastoral
but
the
personal
graces
of
my
companion
made
me
take
small
heed
of
the
landscape
he
was
aglow
with
animal
spirits
and
his
conversation
naively
brilliant
and
of
uncommon
import
understanding
at
a
glance
that
he
belonged
to
a
type
which
is
rather
rare
in
calabria
that
he
was
a
classic
of
a
kind
i
made
every
effort
to
be
pleasant
to
him
and
i
must
have
succeeded
for
he
was
soon
relating
anecdotes
which
would
have
been
neither
instructive
nor
even
intelligible
to
the
fille
all
this
with
angelic
serenity
of
conscience
this
child
was
the
embodiment
of
the
joy
of
life
the
perfect
immoralist
there
was
no
cynicism
in
his
nature
no
cruelty
no
obliquity
no
remorse
nothing
but
sunshine
with
a
few
clouds
sailing
across
the
fathomless
blue
spaces
the
sky
of
hellas
humani
alienum
and
as
i
listened
to
those
glad
tales
i
marvelled
at
the
experiences
that
could
be
crammed
into
seventeen
short
years
what
a
document
the
of
such
a
frolicsome
demon
would
be
what
a
feast
for
the
initiated
could
some
one
be
induced
to
make
them
known
but
such
things
are
hopelessly
out
of
the
question
and
that
is
why
so
many
of
our
wise
people
go
into
their
graves
without
ever
learning
what
happens
in
this
world
among
minor
matters
he
mentioned
that
he
had
already
been
three
times
to
prison
for
certain
little
affairs
of
blood
while
defending
certain
friends
was
it
not
dull
i
asked
in
prison
the
time
passes
pleasantly
anywhere
he
answered
when
you
are
young
i
always
make
friends
even
in
prison
i
could
well
believe
it
his
affinities
were
with
the
blithe
crew
of
the
liber
stratonis
he
had
a
roving
eye
and
the
mouth
of
antinous
and
his
morals
were
those
of
a
condescending
arriving
at
delianuova
after
sunset
he
conceived
the
project
of
accompanying
me
next
morning
up
montalto
i
hesitated
in
the
first
place
i
was
going
not
only
up
that
mountain
but
to
bova
on
the
distant
ionian
littoral
for
my
part
he
broke
in
pigliato
if
you
mistrust
me
here
take
my
knife
an
ugly
blade
pointed
and
two
inches
in
excess
of
the
police
regulation
length
this
act
of
submission
touched
me
but
it
was
not
his
knife
i
feared
so
much
as
that
of
certain
friends
some
little
difference
of
opinion
might
arise
some
question
of
money
or
other
argument
and
lo
the
friends
would
be
at
hand
they
always
are
and
one
more
stranger
might
disappear
among
the
clefts
and
gullies
of
montalto
aspromonte
the
roughest
corner
of
italy
is
no
place
for
misunderstandings
the
knife
decides
promptly
who
is
right
or
wrong
and
only
two
weeks
ago
i
was
warned
not
to
cross
the
district
without
a
carbineer
on
either
side
of
me
but
to
have
clothed
my
thoughts
in
words
during
his
gracious
mood
would
have
been
supremely
unethical
i
contented
myself
with
the
trite
but
pregnant
remark
that
things
sometimes
looked
different
in
the
morning
which
provoked
a
pagan
fit
of
laughter
farewelled
him
with
the
madonna
and
watched
as
he
withdrew
under
the
trees
lithe
and
buoyant
like
a
flame
that
is
swallowed
up
in
the
night
only
then
did
the
real
business
begin
i
should
be
sorry
to
say
into
how
many
houses
and
the
obliging
owner
of
the
local
inn
conducted
me
in
search
of
a
guide
we
traversed
all
the
lanes
of
this
straggling
and
fairly
prosperous
place
and
even
those
of
its
suburb
paracorio
evidently
of
byzantine
origin
the
answer
was
everywhere
the
same
to
montalto
yes
to
bova
no
night
drew
on
apace
and
as
a
last
resource
he
led
the
way
to
the
dwelling
of
a
gentleman
of
the
old
school
a
retired
brigand
to
wit
who
as
i
afterwards
learned
had
some
ten
or
twelve
homicides
to
his
account
delianuova
and
indeed
the
whole
of
aspromonte
has
a
bad
reputation
for
crime
it
was
our
last
remaining
chance
we
found
the
patriarch
sitting
in
a
simple
but
tidy
chamber
smoking
his
pipe
and
playing
with
a
baby
his
rose
as
we
entered
and
discreetly
moved
into
an
adjoining
room
the
cheery
put
the
baby
down
to
crawl
on
the
floor
and
his
eyes
sparkled
when
he
heard
of
bova
ah
one
speaks
of
bova
he
said
a
fine
walk
over
the
mountain
he
much
regretted
that
he
was
too
old
for
the
trip
but
he
thought
might
know
something
of
the
country
it
pained
him
too
that
he
could
not
offer
me
a
glass
of
wine
there
was
none
in
the
house
in
his
day
he
added
it
was
not
thought
right
to
drink
in
the
modern
fashion
this
was
responsible
for
considerable
mischief
it
troubled
the
brain
driving
men
to
do
things
they
afterwards
repented
he
drank
only
milk
having
become
accustomed
to
it
during
a
long
life
among
the
hills
milk
cools
the
blood
he
said
and
steadies
the
hand
and
keeps
a
man
judgment
undisturbed
the
person
he
had
named
was
found
after
some
further
search
he
was
a
bronzed
type
of
about
fifty
who
began
by
refusing
his
services
but
soon
relented
on
hearing
the
recommendation
of
his
qualities
xxxi
southern
saintliness
southern
saints
like
their
worshippers
put
on
new
faces
and
vestments
in
the
course
of
ages
old
ones
die
away
new
ones
take
their
place
several
hundred
of
the
older
class
of
saint
have
clean
faded
from
the
popular
memory
and
are
now
so
forgotten
that
the
wisest
priest
can
tell
you
nothing
about
them
save
perhaps
that
he
in
the
church
meaning
that
some
fragment
of
his
holy
anatomy
survives
as
a
relic
amid
a
collection
of
similar
antiques
but
you
can
find
their
histories
in
early
literature
and
their
names
linger
on
old
maps
where
they
are
given
to
promontories
and
other
natural
features
which
are
gradually
being
such
saints
were
chiefly
byzantines
or
africans
who
by
miraculous
intervention
protected
the
village
or
district
of
which
they
were
patrons
from
the
manifold
scourges
of
they
took
the
place
of
the
classic
tutelar
deities
they
were
men
they
could
fight
and
in
those
troublous
times
that
is
exactly
what
saints
were
made
for
with
the
softening
of
manners
a
new
element
appears
male
saints
lost
their
chief
and
these
virile
creatures
were
superseded
by
pacific
women
so
to
give
only
one
instance
saint
rosalia
in
palermo
displaced
the
former
protector
saint
mark
her
sacred
bones
were
miraculously
discovered
in
a
cave
and
have
since
been
identified
as
those
of
a
goat
but
it
was
not
till
the
twelfth
century
that
the
cult
of
female
saints
began
to
assume
imposing
dimensions
of
the
madonna
no
mention
occurs
in
the
songs
of
bishop
paulinus
fourth
century
no
monument
exists
in
the
neapolitan
catacombs
thereafter
her
cult
begins
to
dominate
she
supplied
the
natives
with
what
orthodox
christianity
did
not
give
them
but
what
they
had
possessed
from
early
times
a
female
element
in
religion
those
greek
settlers
had
their
nymphs
their
venus
and
so
forth
the
mother
of
god
absorbed
and
continued
their
functions
there
is
indeed
only
one
of
these
female
pagan
divinities
whose
role
she
has
not
endeavoured
to
usurp
athene
herein
she
reflects
the
minds
of
her
creators
the
priests
and
common
people
whose
ideal
woman
contents
herself
with
the
duties
of
motherhood
i
doubt
whether
an
an
intellectual
goddess
could
ever
have
been
evolved
their
attitude
towards
gods
in
general
is
too
childlike
and
positive
south
italians
famous
for
abstractions
in
philosophy
can
not
endure
them
in
religion
unlike
ourselves
they
do
not
desire
to
learn
anything
from
their
deities
or
to
argue
about
them
they
only
wish
to
love
and
be
loved
in
return
reserving
to
themselves
the
right
to
punish
them
when
they
deserve
it
countless
cases
are
on
record
where
pictures
or
statues
of
madonnas
and
saints
have
been
thrown
into
a
ditch
for
not
doing
what
they
were
told
or
for
not
keeping
their
share
of
a
bargain
during
the
vesuvius
eruption
of
a
good
number
were
subjected
to
this
punishment
because
they
neglected
to
protect
their
worshippers
from
the
calamity
according
to
contract
so
many
candles
and
festivals
so
much
protection
for
the
same
reason
the
adult
jesus
the
teacher
the
god
is
practically
unknown
he
is
too
remote
from
themselves
and
the
ordinary
activities
of
their
daily
lives
he
is
not
married
like
his
mother
he
has
no
trade
like
his
father
mark
calls
him
a
carpenter
moreover
the
maxims
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
are
so
repugnant
to
the
south
italian
as
to
be
almost
incomprehensible
in
effigy
this
period
of
christ
life
is
portrayed
most
frequently
in
the
primitive
monuments
of
the
catacombs
erected
when
tradition
was
purer
three
aspects
of
christ
life
figure
here
the
which
not
only
appeals
to
the
people
love
of
babyhood
but
also
carries
on
the
old
traditions
of
the
lar
familiaris
and
of
horus
next
the
youthful
jesus
beloved
of
local
female
mystics
and
lastly
the
crucified
that
grim
and
gloomy
image
of
suffering
which
was
imported
or
at
least
furiously
fostered
by
the
spaniards
the
engulfing
of
the
saints
by
the
mother
of
god
is
due
also
to
political
reasons
the
vatican
once
centralized
in
its
policy
began
to
be
disquieted
by
the
persistent
survival
of
byzantinism
greek
cults
and
language
lingered
up
to
the
twelfth
century
with
the
tacitean
she
exercised
more
severity
towards
the
than
towards
actual
paganism
footnote
greek
and
egyptian
anchorites
were
established
in
south
italy
by
the
fourth
century
but
paganism
was
still
flourishing
locally
in
the
sixth
there
is
some
evidence
that
christians
used
to
take
part
in
pagan
festivals
the
madonna
was
a
fit
instrument
for
sweeping
away
the
particularist
tendencies
of
the
past
she
attacked
and
other
outworn
superstitions
like
a
benignant
whirlwind
she
careered
over
the
land
and
these
now
enigmatical
shapes
and
customs
fell
faster
than
leaves
of
vallombrosa
no
sanctuary
or
cave
so
remote
that
she
did
not
endeavour
to
expel
its
male
saint
its
old
presiding
genius
whether
byzantine
or
roman
but
saints
have
tough
lives
and
do
not
yield
without
a
struggle
they
fought
for
their
privileges
like
the
daemons
they
were
and
sometimes
came
off
victorious
those
sanctuaries
that
proved
too
strong
to
be
taken
by
storm
were
sapped
by
an
artful
and
determined
siege
the
combat
goes
on
to
this
day
this
is
what
is
happening
to
the
and
still
triumphant
saint
januarius
who
is
hard
pressed
by
sheer
force
of
numbers
like
those
phagocytes
which
congregate
from
all
sides
to
assail
some
weakened
cell
in
the
body
physical
even
so
in
frenzied
competition
with
each
other
cluster
thickest
round
some
imperilled
venerable
of
ancient
lineage
bent
on
his
destruction
the
madonna
dell
arco
del
soccorso
and
at
least
fifty
others
not
forgetting
the
madonna
di
pompei
they
have
all
established
themselves
in
the
particular
domain
of
januarius
they
are
all
undermining
his
reputation
and
claiming
to
possess
his
special
gifts
footnote
he
is
known
to
have
quelled
an
outbreak
of
vesuvius
in
the
fifth
century
though
his
earliest
church
i
believe
only
dates
from
the
ninth
his
blood
famous
for
liquefaction
is
not
mentioned
till
early
monastic
movements
of
the
roman
church
also
played
their
part
in
obliterating
old
religious
landmarks
settling
down
in
some
remote
place
with
the
madonna
as
their
leader
or
as
their
second
mother
these
companies
of
holy
men
soon
acquired
such
temporal
and
spiritual
influence
as
enabled
them
successfully
to
oppose
their
divinity
to
the
local
saint
whose
once
bright
glories
began
to
pale
before
her
effulgence
their
labours
in
favour
of
the
mother
of
god
were
part
of
that
work
of
consolidating
papal
power
which
was
afterwards
carried
on
by
the
jesuits
perhaps
what
chiefly
accounts
for
the
spread
of
is
the
human
craving
for
novelty
you
can
invent
most
easily
where
no
fixed
legends
are
established
now
the
saints
have
fixed
legendary
attributes
and
histories
and
as
culture
advances
it
becomes
increasingly
difficult
to
manufacture
new
saints
with
fresh
and
original
characters
and
yet
passable
pedigrees
the
experiment
is
tried
now
and
again
while
the
old
saints
have
been
exploited
and
are
now
inefficient
worn
out
like
old
toys
madonna
on
the
other
hand
can
subdivide
with
the
ease
of
an
amoeba
and
yet
never
lose
her
identity
or
credibility
moreover
thanks
to
her
divine
character
anything
can
be
accredited
to
her
anything
good
however
wonderful
lastly
the
traditions
concerning
her
are
so
conveniently
vague
that
they
actually
foster
the
mythopoetic
faculty
hence
her
success
again
the
were
separatists
they
fought
for
their
own
towns
against
african
intruders
and
in
those
frequent
and
bloody
battles
which
are
a
feature
of
italian
medievalism
nowadays
it
is
hardly
proper
that
neighbouring
townsmen
aided
and
abetted
by
their
respective
saints
should
sally
forth
to
cut
each
others
throats
the
madonna
as
cosmopolitan
nike
is
a
fitter
patroness
for
settled
society
she
also
found
a
ready
welcome
in
consequence
of
the
pastoral
institutions
of
the
country
in
which
the
mother
plays
such
a
conspicuous
role
so
deeply
are
they
ingrained
here
that
if
the
mother
of
god
had
not
existed
the
group
would
have
been
deemed
incomplete
a
family
without
a
mother
is
to
them
like
a
tree
without
roots
a
thing
which
can
not
be
this
accounts
for
the
fact
that
their
trinity
is
not
ours
it
consists
of
the
mother
the
father
saint
joseph
and
the
child
with
saint
anne
looming
in
the
background
the
grandmother
is
an
important
personage
in
the
patriarchal
family
the
creator
of
all
things
and
the
holy
ghost
have
evaporated
they
are
too
intangible
and
but
she
never
became
a
true
cosmopolitan
nike
save
in
literature
the
decentralizing
spirit
of
south
italy
was
too
strong
for
her
she
had
to
conform
to
the
old
custom
of
geographical
specialization
in
all
save
in
name
she
doffed
her
essential
character
of
mother
of
god
and
became
a
local
an
accessible
attached
to
some
particular
district
an
inhabitant
of
village
a
would
stand
a
poor
chance
of
his
prayers
being
heard
by
the
madonna
of
village

if
you
have
a
headache
it
is
no
use
applying
to
the
of
the
hens
who
deals
with
diseases
of
women
you
will
find
yourself
in
a
pretty
fix
if
you
expect
financial
assistance
from
the
madonna
of
village
c
she
is
a
in
short
these
hundreds
of
madonnas
have
taken
up
the
qualities
of
the
saints
they
supplanted
they
can
often
outdo
them
and
this
is
yet
another
reason
for
their
success
it
is
a
fact
for
example
that
many
holy
men
have
been
nourished
by
the
milk
of
the
mother
of
god
not
as
a
catholic
writer
says
in
a
mystic
or
spiritual
sense
but
with
their
actual
lips
saint
bernard
among
a
hundred
a
thousand
others
nor
is
this
all
for
in
the
year
a
painted
image
of
the
madonna
not
far
from
the
city
of
carinola
was
observed
to
diffuse
abundant
milk
for
the
edification
of
a
great
concourse
of
spectators
a
miracle
which
was
recognized
as
such
by
the
bishop
of
that
diocese
monsignor
paolo
ayrola
who
wrote
a
report
on
the
subject
some
more
of
this
authentic
milk
is
kept
in
a
bottle
in
the
convent
of
mater
domini
on
vesuvius
and
the
chronicle
of
that
establishment
printed
in
says
since
mary
is
the
mother
and
of
the
church
may
she
not
have
left
some
drops
of
her
precious
milk
as
a
gift
to
this
church
even
as
we
still
possess
some
of
the
blood
of
christ
in
various
churches
there
exists
some
of
this
milk
by
means
of
which
many
graces
and
benefits
are
obtained
we
find
such
relics
for
example
in
the
church
of
saint
luigi
in
naples
namely
two
bottles
full
of
the
milk
of
the
blessed
virgin
and
this
milk
becomes
fluid
on
of
the
madonna
as
everybody
can
see
also
in
this
convent
of
mater
domini
the
milk
sometimes
liquefies
during
eruptions
of
vesuvius
this
bottle
is
carried
abroad
in
procession
and
always
dispels
the
danger
saint
januarius
must
indeed
look
to
his
laurels
meanwhile
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
the
mother
of
god
has
condescended
to
employ
the
method
of
holy
relics
which
she
once
combated
so
strenuously
her
milk
competing
with
the
blood
of
saint
john
the
fat
of
saint
laurence
and
those
other
physiological
curios
which
are
still
preserved
for
the
edification
of
believers
all
of
which
would
pass
if
a
subtle
poison
had
not
been
creeping
in
to
taint
religious
institutions
taken
by
themselves
these
infantile
observances

not
necessarily
harm
family
life

man
can
believe
a
considerable
deal
of
nonsense

yet
go
about
his
daily
work
in
a
natural
and
cheerful
manner
but
when
the
body
is
despised
and
tormented
the
mind
loses
its
equilibrium
and
when
that
happens
nonsense
may
assume
a
sinister
shape
we
have
seen
it
in
england
where
during
the
ascetic
movement
of
puritanism
more
witches
were
burnt
than
in
the
whole
period
before
and
after
the
virus
of
asceticism
entered
south
italy
from
three
principal
sources
from
early
ages
the
country
had
stood
in
commercial
relations
with
the
valley
of
the
nile
and
even
as
its
black
magic
is
largely
tinged
with
egyptian
practices
so
its
magic
of
the
white
kind
its
saintly
legends
bear
the
impress
of
the
and
perverted
of
those
who
called
themselves
christians
footnote
these
ascetics
were
here
before
christianity
see
philo
judaeus
in
fact
there
is
not
a
single
element
in
the
new
faith
which
had
not
been
independently
developed
by
the
pagans
many
of
whom
like
seneca
epictetus
and
marcus
aurelius
were
ripe
for
the
most
abject
but
this
orientalism
fell
at
first
upon
unfruitful
soil
the
vatican
was
yet
wavering
and
hellenic
notions
of
conduct
still
survived
it
received
a
further
rebuff
at
the
hands
of
men
like
benedict
who
set
up
sounder
ideals
of
holiness
introducing
a
gleam
of
sanity
even
in
that
insanest
of
institutions
the
herding
together
of
idle
men
to
the
glory
of
god
but
things
became
more
centralized
as
the
papacy
gainedground
the
strong
christian
the
independent
ruler
or
warrior
or
builder
saint
was
tolerated
only
if
he
conformed
to
its
precepts
and
the
inauspicious
rise
of
subservient
ascetic
orders
like
the
franciscans
and
dominicans
who
quickly
invaded
the
fair
regions
of
the
south
gave
an
evil
tone
to
their
christianity
there
has
always
been
a
contrary
tendency
at
work
the
ionic
spirit
heritage
of
the
past
monkish
ideals
of
chastity
and
poverty
have
never
appealed
to
the
hearts
of
people
priests
or
prelates
of
the
south
they
will
endure
much
fondness
in
their
religion
but
not
those
phenomena
of
cruelty
and
pruriency
which
are
inseparably
connected
with
asceticism
their
notions
have
ever
been
akin
to
those
of
the
sage
xenocrates
who
held
that
happiness
consists
not
only
in
the
possession
of
human
virtues
but
the
accomplishment
of
natural
acts
among
the
latter
they
include
the
acquisition
of
wealth
and
the
satisfaction
of
carnal
needs
at
this
time
too
the
old
hellenic
curiosity
was
not
wholly
dimmed
they
took
an
intelligent
interest
in
imported
creeds
like
that
of
luther
which
if
not
convincing
at
least
satisfied
their
desire
for
novelty
theirs
was
exactly
the
attitude
of
the
athenians
towards
new
god
and
protestantism
might
have
spread
far
in
the
south
had
it
not
been
ferociously
repressed
but
after
the
brilliant
humanistic
period
of
the
aragons
there
followed
the
third
and
fiercest
reaction
that
of
the
spanish
viceroys
whose
misrule
struck
at
every
one
of
the
roots
of
national
prosperity
it
is
that
seicentismo
which
a
modern
writer
niceforo
barbara
has
recognized
as
the
blight
the
evil
genius
of
south
italy
the
ionic
spirit
did
not
help
the
people
much
at
this
time
the
greatest
of
these
viceroys
don
pietro
di
toledo
hanged
of
them
in
eight
years
and
then
confessed
with
a
sigh
that
he
did
not
know
what
more
he
could
do
what
more
he
do
as
a
pious
spaniard
he
was
incapable
of
understanding
that
quarterings
and
breakings
on
the
rack
were
of
less
avail
than
the
education
of
the
populace
in
certain
secular
notions
of
good
conduct
notions
which
it
was
the
business
of
his
church
not
to
teach
reading
through
the
legislation
of
the
viceregal
period
one
is
astonished
to
find
how
little
was
done
for
the
common
people
who
lived
like
the
veriest
beasts
of
earth
their
civil
rulers
scholars
and
gentlemen
most
of
them
really
believed
that
the
example
of
half
a
million
illiterate
and
vicious
monks
was
all
the
education
they
needed
and
yet
one
notes
with
surprise
that
the
government
was
perpetually
at
loggerheads
with
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
true
but
it
is
wonderful
with
what
intuitive
alacrity
they
joined
forces
when
it
was
a
question
of
repelling
their
common
antagonist
enlightenment
from
this
rank
soil
there
sprang
up
an
exotic
efflorescence
of
holiness
if
south
italy
swarmed
with
sinners
as
the
experiences
of
don
pietro
seemed
to
show
it
also
swarmed
with
saints
and
hardly
one
of
them
escaped
the
influence
of
the
period
the
love
of
futile
ornamentation
their
piety
is
overloaded
with
embellishing
touches
and
needless
excrescences
of
virtue
it
was
the
baroque
period
of
saintliness
as
of
architecture
i
have
already
given
some
account
of
one
of
them
the
flying
monk
chapter
x
and
have
perused
the
biographies
of
at
least
fifty
others
one
can
not
help
observing
a
great
uniformity
in
their
lives
a
kind
of
family
resemblance
this
parallelism
is
due
to
the
simple
reason
that
there
is
only
one
right
for
a
thousand
wrongs
one
may
well
look
in
vain
here
for
those
perversions
and
aberrations
which
disfigure
the
histories
of
average
mankind
these
saints
are
all
alike
monotonously
alike
if
one
cares
to
say
so
in
their
chastity
and
other
official
virtues
but
a
little
acquaintance
with
the
subject
will
soon
show
you
that
so
far
as
the
range
of
their
particular
christianity
allowed
of
it
there
is
a
praiseworthy
and
even
astonishing
diversity
among
them
nearly
all
of
them
could
fly
more
or
less
nearly
all
of
them
could
cure
diseases
and
cause
the
clouds
to
rain
nearly
all
of
them
were
illiterate
and
every
one
of
them
died
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
with
roseate
complexion
sweetly
smelling
corpse
and
flexible
limbs
yet
each
one
has
his
particular
gifts
his
strong
point
joseph
of
copertino
specialized
in
flying
others
were
conspicuous
for
their
heroism
in
sitting
in
hot
baths
devouring
ordure
tormenting
themselves
with
pins
and
so
forth
here
for
instance
is
a
good
representative
biography
the
life
of
saint
giangiuseppe
della
croce
born
reprinted
for
the
occasion
of
his
solemn
sanctification

he
resembled
other
saints
in
many
points
he
never
allowed
the
vermin
which
generated
in
his
bed
to
be
disturbed
he
wore
the
same
clothes
for
years
on
end
with
women
his
behaviour
was
that
of
an
animated
statue
and
during
his
long
life
he
never
looked
any
one
in
the
face
even
his
were
known
to
him
only
by
their
voices
he
could
raise
the
dead
relieve
a
duchess
of
a
devil
in
the
shape
of
a
black
dog
change
chestnuts
into
apricots
and
bad
wine
into
good
his
flesh
was
encrusted
with
sores
the
result
of
his
fierce
scarifications
he
was
always
half
starved
and
when
delicate
viands
were
brought
to
him
he
used
to
say
to
his
body
have
you
seen
them
have
you
smelt
them
then
let
that
suffice
for
you
he
too
could
fly
a
little
so
once
when
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
the
monks
of
the
convent
at
last
discovered
him
in
the
church
raised
so
high
above
the
ground
that
his
head
touched
the
ceiling
this
is
not
a
bad
performance
for
a
mere
lad
as
he
then
was
and
how
useful
this
gift
became
in
old
age
was
seen
when
being
almost
incapable
of
moving
his
legs
and
with
body
half
paralysed
he
was
nevertheless
enabled
to
accompany
a
procession
for
the
length
of
two
miles
on
foot
walking
to
the
stupefaction
of
thousands
of
spectators
at
about
a
cubit
height
above
the
street
on
air
after
the
fashion
of
those
hindu
gods
whose
feet
so
the
pagans
fable
are
too
pure
to
touch
mortal
earth
his
love
of
poverty
moreover
was
so
intense
that
even
after
his
death
a
picture
of
him
which
his
relatives
had
tried
to
attach
to
the
wall
in
loving
remembrance
repeatedly
fell
down
again
although
nailed
very
securely
nor
did
it
remain
fixed
until
they
realized
that
its
costly
gilt
frame
was
objectionable
to
the
saint
in
heaven
and
accordingly
removed
it
no
wonder
the
infant
jesus
was
pleased
to
descend
from
the
breast
of
mary
and
take
rest
for
several
hours
in
the
arms
of
saint
giangiuseppe
who
on
being
disturbed
by
some
priestly
visitor
exclaimed
o
how
i
have
enjoyed
holding
the
holy
babe
in
my
arms
this
is
an
old
and
favourite
motif
it
occurs
for
example
in
the
fioretti
of
saint
francis
there
are
precedents
in
fact
for
all
these
divine
favours
but
his
distinguishing
feature
his
dominating
gift
was
that
of
prophecy
especially
in
foretelling
the
deaths
of
children
which
he
almost
always
accompanied
with
jocular
words
scherzi
on
his
lips
he
would
enter
a
house
and
genially
remark
o
what
an
odour
of
paradise
sooner
or
later
one
or
more
of
the
children
of
the
family
would
perish
to
a
boy
of
twelve
he
said
be
good
natale
for
the
angels
are
coming
to
take
you
these
playful
words
seem
to
have
weighed
considerably
on
the
boy
mind
and
sure
enough
after
a
few
years
he
died
but
even
more
charming
grazioso
the
biographer
calls
it
was
the
incident
when
he
once
asked
a
father
whether
he
would
give
his
son
to
saint
pasquale
the
fond
parent
agreed
thinking
that
the
words
referred
to
the
boy
future
career
in
the
church
but
the
saint
meant
something
quite
different
he
meant
a
career
in
heaven
and
in
less
than
a
month
the
child
died
to
a
little
girl
who
was
crying
in
the
street
he
said
i
do
want
to
hear
you
any
more
go
and
sing
in
paradise
and
meeting
her
a
short
time
after
he
said
what
are
you
still
here
in
a
few
days
she
was
dead
the
biography
gives
many
instances
of
this
pretty
gift
which
would
hardly
have
contributed
to
the
saint
popularity
in
england
or
any
other
country
save
this
where
although
the
surviving
youngsters
are
described
as
struck
with
terror
at
the
mere
name
of
the
servant
of
god
the
parents
were
naturally
glad
to
have
one
or
two
angels
in
the
family
to
act
as
pleaders
for
those
that
remained
on
earth
and
the
mention
of
the
legal
profession
brings
me
to
one
really
instructive
miracle
it
is
usually
to
be
observed
after
a
saint
has
been
canonized
that
heaven
by
some
further
sign
or
signs
signifies
approval
of
this
solemn
act
of
the
vicar
of
god
indeed
to
judge
by
these
biographies
such
a
course
is
not
only
customary
but
to
use
a
worldly
expression
and
so
it
happened
after
the
decree
relative
to
saint
giangiuseppe
had
been
pronounced
in
the
vatican
basilica
by
his
holiness
pius
vi
in
the
presence
of
the
assembled
cardinals
innumerable
celestial
portents
their
enumeration
fills
eleven
pages
of
the
life
confirmed
and
ratified
the
great
event
and
among
them
this
the
notary
who
had
drawn
up
both
the
ordinary
and
the
apostolic
was
cured
of
a
grievous
apoplexy
survived
for
four
years
and
finally
died
on
the
very
anniversary
of
the
death
of
the
saint
involuntarily
one
contrasts
this
heavenly
largesse
with
the
sordid
guineas
which
would
have
contented
an
english
lawyer
or
glance
into
the
biography
of
the
venerable
sister
orsola
benincasa
she
too
could
fly
a
little
and
raise
men
from
the
dead
she
cured
diseases
foretold
her
own
death
and
that
of
others
lived
for
a
month
on
the
sole
nourishment
of
a
consecrated
wafer
she
could
speak
latin
and
polish
although
she
had
been
taught
nothing
at
all
wrought
miracles
after
death
and
possessed
to
a
heroic
degree
the
virtues
of
patience
humility
temperance
justice
etc
etc
so
inflamed
was
she
with
divine
love
that
almost
every
day
thick
steam
issued
out
of
her
mouth
which
was
observed
to
be
destructive
to
articles
of
clothing
her
heated
body
when
ice
was
applied
used
to
hiss
like
a
iron
under
similar
conditions
as
a
child
she
already
cried
for
other
people
sins
she
was
always
hunting
for
her
own
and
would
gladly
at
the
end
of
her
long
and
blameless
career
have
exchanged
her
sins
for
those
of
the
youthful
duchess
of
aquaro
an
interesting
phenomenon
by
the
way
the
theory
of
sinfulness
which
crops
up
at
this
particular
period
of
history
for
our
conception
of
sin
is
alien
to
the
latin
mind
there
is
no
sin
in
italy
and
this
is
not
the
least
of
her
many
attractions
it
is
an
article
manufactured
exclusively
for
export

there
are
of
course
much
earlier
biographies
of
all
these
saints
concerning
sister
orsola
we
possess
for
instance
the
remarkable
pamphlet
by
cesare
caesaris
aevoli
neapolitan
apologia
pro

quas

achieves
the
distinction
of
never
mentioning
orsola
by
name
she
is
only
once
referred
to
as
mulier
de
qua
agitur
but
i
prefer
to
quote
from
the
more
recent
ones
because
they
are
authoritative
in
so
far
as
they
have
been
written
on
the
basis
of
miracles
attested
by
and
accepted
as
veracious
by
the
vatican
tribunal
sister
orsola
though
born
in
was
only
declared
venerable
by
pontifical
decree
of
biographies
prior
to
that
date
are
therefore
statements
and
might
conceivably
contain
errors
of
fact
this
is
out
of
the
question
here
as
is
clearly
shown
by
the
author
on
p
orsola
speciality
however
were
those
frequent
conditions
by
reason
of
which
during
her
lifetime
she
was
created
protectress
of
the
city
of
naples
i
can
not
tell
whether
she
was
the
first
to
obtain
this
honour
certainly
the
seven
holy
protectors
concerning
whom
paolo
regio
writes
were
all
musty
old
males
and
here
is
quite
another
biography
that
of
alfonso
di
liguori
born
the
founder
of
the
redemptorist
order
and
a
canonized
saint
he
too
could
fly
a
little
and
raise
the
dead
to
life
he
suffered
caused
the
clouds
to
rain
calmed
an
eruption
of
vesuvius
multiplied
food
and
so
forth
such
was
his
bashfulness
that
even
as
an
aged
bishop
he
refused
to
be
unrobed
by
his
attendants
such
his
instinct
for
moral
cleanliness
that
once
when
a
messenger
had
alighted
at
his
convent
accompanied
by
a
soldier
he
instantly
detected
under
the
military
disguise
the
lineaments
of
a
young
despite
these
divine
gifts
he
always
needed
a
confessor
an
enormous
batch
of
miracles
accompanied
his
sanctification
but
he
only
employed
these
divine
graces
by
the
way
he
was
by
profession
not
a
but
a
clerical
instructor
organizer
and
writer
the
vatican
has
conferred
on
him
the
rare
title
of
doctor
ecclesia
which
he
shares
with
saint
augustine
and
some
others
the
biography
from
which
i
have
drawn
these
details
was
printed
in
rome
in
it
is
valuable
because
it
is
modern
and
so
far
authentic
and
for
two
other
reasons
in
the
first
place
curiously
enough
it
barely
mentions
the
saint
his
writings
secondly
it
is
a
good
example
of
what
i
call
the
pious
palimpsest
it
is
with
contradictory
matter
the
author
for
example
while
accidentally
informing
us
that
alfonso
kept
a
carriage
imputes
to
him
a
degrading
oriental
love
of
dirt
and
tattered
garments
in
order
i
presume
to
make
his
character
conform
to
the
grosser
ideals
of
the
mendicant
friars
i
do
not
believe
in
these
traits
in
his
hatred
of
soap
and
clean
apparel
from
his
works
i
deduce
a
different
original
he
was
refined
and
urbane
of
a
casuistical
and
prying
disposition
like
many
sensitive
men
unduly
preoccupied
with
the
sexual
life
of
youth
like
a
true
feudal
aristocrat
ever
ready
to
apply
force
where
verbal
admonition
proved
unavailing
in
capacities
these
saints
were
all
put
in
the
shade
by
the
calabrian
francesco
di
paola
who
raised
fifteen
persons
from
the
dead
in
his
boyhood
he
used
to
perform
a
hundred
miracles
a
day
and
it
was
a
miracle
when
a
day
passed
without
a
miracle
the
index
alone
of
any
one
of
his
numerous
biographies
is
enough
to
make
one
head
swim
the
vast
majority
of
saints
of
this
period
do
not
belong
to
that
third
sex
after
which
according
to
some
the
human
race
has
ever
striven
the
constructive
and
purposeful
third
sex
they
are
wholly
sexless
unsocial
and
futile
beings
the
negation
of
every
masculine
or
feminine
virtue
their
independence
fettered
by
the
iron
rules
of
the
vatican
and
of
their
particular
order
these
creatures
had
to
do
and
like
the
rest
of
us
under
such
conditions
became
vacuously
introspective
those
honourable
saintly
combats
of
the
past
with
external
enemies
and
plagues
and
stormy
seasons
were
transplanted
from
without
into
the
microcosm
within
taking
the
shape
of
hallucinations
and
they
were
no
longer
actors
but
sufferers
automata
who
attained
a
degree
of
inanity
which
would
have
made
their
old
byzantine
prototypes
burst
with
envy
yet
they
vary
in
their
gifts
each
one
as
i
have
said
has
his
or
her
strong
point
why
the
reason
of
this
diversity
lies
in
the
furious
competition
between
the
various
monastic
orders
of
the
time
in
those
unedifying
squabbles
which
led
to
litigation
and
complaints
to
in
rome
every
one
of
these
saints
from
the
first
dawning
of
his
divine
talents
was
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
jealous
hatred
on
the
part
of
his
if
one
order
came
out
with
a
flying
wonder
another
in
frantic
emulation
would
introduce
some
new
speciality
to
eclipse
his
fame
something
in
the
fasting
line
it
may
be
or
a
female
mystic
whose
palpitating
letters
to
jesus
christ
would
melt
all
readers
to
pity
the
franciscans
for
instance
dissected
the
body
of
a
certain
holy
margaret
and
discovered
in
her
heart
the
symbols
of
the
trinity
and
of
the
passion
this
bold
and
original
idea
would
have
gained
them
much
credit
but
for
the
rival
dominicans
who
promptly
discovered
and
dissected
another
saintly
margaret
whose
heart
contained
three
stones
on
which
were
engraven
portraits
of
the
virgin
mary
footnote
these
and
other
details
will
be
found
in
the
four
volumes
das
heidentum
in
der
romischen
kirche
gotha
by
theodor
trede
a
late
protestant
parson
in
naples
strongly
tinged
with
but
whose
facts
may
be
relied
upon
indeed
he
gives
chapter
and
verse
for
them
so
they
ceaselessly
unearthed
fresh
saints
with
a
view
to
disparaging
each
other
all
of
them
waiting
for
a
favourable
moment
when
the
vatican
could
be
successfully
approached
to
consider
their
particular
claims
for
it
stands
to
reason
that
a
carmelite
pope
would
prefer
a
carmelite
saint
to
one
of
the
jesuits
and
so
forth
and
over
all
throned
the
inquisition
in
rome
alert
testing
the
irregularities
of
the
various
orders
and
harassing
their
respective
saints
with
olympic
impartiality
i
know
that
mystics
such
as
orsola
benincasa
are
supposed
to
have
another
side
to
their
character
an
eminently
practical
side
it
is
perfectly
true
and
we
need
not
go
out
of
england
to
learn
it
that
piety
is
not
necessarily
inconsistent
with
nimbleness
in
worldly
affairs
but
the
mundane
achievements
the
monasteries
and
churches
of
of
these
southern
ecstatics
are
the
work
of
the
confessor
and
not
of
the
saint
trainers
of
performing
animals
are
aware
how
these
differ
in
plasticity
of
disposition
and
amenability
to
discipline
the
spiritual
adviser
who
knows
his
business
must
be
quick
to
detect
these
various
qualities
in
the
minds
of
his
penitents
and
to
utilize
them
to
the
best
advantage
it
is
inconceivable
for
instance
that
the
orsola
was
other
than
a
neuropathic
nonentity
a
blind
instrument
in
the
hands
of
what
we
should
call
her
backers
chiefest
of
whom
in
naples
were
two
spanish
priests
borii
and
navarro
whose
local
efforts
were
supported
at
by
the
saintly
filippo
neri
and
the
learned
cardinal
baronius
this
is
noticeable
the
earlier
of
these
godly
biographies
are
written
in
latin
and
these
are
more
restrained
in
their
language
they
were
composed
one
imagines
for
the
priests
and
educated
classes
who
could
dispense
to
a
certain
degree
with
prodigies
but
the
later
ones
from
the
viceregal
period
onwards
are
in
the
vernacular
and
display
a
marked
deterioration
one
must
suppose
that
they
were
printed
for
such
of
the
common
people
as
could
still
read
up
to
a
few
years
ago
per
cent
of
the
populace
were
analphabetic
they
are
pervaded
by
the
characteristic
of
all
contemporary
literature
and
art
that
deliberate
intention
to
which
originated
with
the
poet
marino
who
declared
such
to
have
been
his
object
and
ideal
the
miracles
certainly
do
astound
they
are
as
as
the
writers
claim
them
to
be
how
they
ever
came
to
occur
must
be
left
to
the
consciences
of
those
who
swore
on
oath
to
the
truth
of
them
during
this
period
the
mother
of
god
as
a
local
saint
increased
in
popularity
there
was
a
ceaseless
flow
of
monographs
dealing
with
particular
madonnas
as
well
as
a
small
library
on
what
the
germans
would
doubtless
call
the
madonna
as
a
whole
here
is
serafino
montorio
zodiaco
di
maria
printed
in
on
the
lines
of
that
monster
of
a
book
by
gumppenberg
it
treats
of
over
two
hundred
subspecies
of
madonna
worshipped
in
different
parts
of
south
italy
which
is
divided
for
these
celestial
purposes
into
twelve
regions
according
to
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
the
book
is
dedicated
by
the
author
to
his
sovereign
lady
the
madre
di
dio
and
might
in
truth
have
been
written
to
the
glory
of
that
protean
old
magna
mater
by
one
of
tonsured
herd
possessed
of
much
industry
but
little
discrimination
footnote
the
mater
dei
was
officially
installed
in
the
place
of
magna
mater
at
the
synod
of
ephesus
in
such
as
it
is
it
reflects
the
crude
mental
status
of
the
dominican
order
to
which
the
author
belonged
i
warmly
recommend
this
book
to
all
englishmen
desirous
of
understanding
the
south
it
is
pure
undiluted
paganism
paganism
of
a
bad
school
one
would
think
it
marked
the
lowest
possible
ebb
of
christian
spirituality
but
this
is
by
no
means
the
case
as
i
shall
presently
show
how
different
from
such
straightforward
unreason
are
the
etherealized
saccharine
effusions
of
the
glories
of
mary
by
alfonso
di
liguori
they
represent
the
other
pole
of
mariolatry
the
gentlemanly
pole
and
under
the
influence
of
a
new
kind
of
saintly
physiognomy
was
elaborated
as
we
can
see
from
contemporary
prints
and
pictures
the
bearded
were
extinct
in
the
place
of
them
this
mawkish
love
for
the
virgin
developed
a
corresponding
type
of
adorer
emasculate
youths
posing
in
ecstatic
attitudes
with
a
nauseous
feminine
smirk
rather
an
unpleasant
sort
of
saint
the
unwholesome
without
which
no
holy
man
of
the
period
was
complete
naturally
left
its
mark
upon
literature
notably
on
that
of
certain
spanish
theologians
but
good
specimens
of
what
i
mean
may
also
be
found
in
the
theologia
moralis
of
liguori
the
kind
of
stuff
that
is
which
would
be
classed
as
curious
in
catalogues
and
kept
in
a
locked
cupboard
by
the
most
paterfamilias
reading
these
elucubrations
of
alfonso
one
feels
that
the
saint
has
pondered
long
and
lovingly
upon
themes
like
et
quando
peccata
sint
or
tactu
et
adspectu
corporis
he
writes
with
all
the
authority
of
an
expert
whose
experiences
in
the
confessional
have
been
amplified
and
irradiated
by
divine
inspiration
i
hesitate
what
to
call
this
literature
seeing
that
it
was
obviously
written
to
the
glory
of
god
and
his
virgin
mother
the
congregation
of
the
index
which
was
severe
in
the
matter
of
indecent
publications
and
prohibited
decameron
on
these
grounds
hailed
with
approval
the
appearance
of
such
treatises
composed
as
they
were
for
the
guidance
of
young
priests
cruelty
in
the
shape
of
the
inquisition
and
lasciviousness
as
exemplified
by
such
pious
filth
these
are
the
prime
fruits
of
that
cult
of
asceticism
which
for
centuries
the
government
strove
to
impose
upon
south
italy
if
the
people
were
saved
it
was
due
to
that
substratum
of
sanity
of
greek
which
resisted
the
one
and
derided
the
other
whoever
has
saturated
himself
with
the
records
will
marvel
not
so
much
that
the
inhabitants
preserved
some
shreds
of
common
sense
and
decent
feeling
as
that
they
survived
at
all
he
will
marvel
that
the
once
fair
kingdom
was
not
converted
into
a
wilderness
saintly
but
uninhabited
like
spain
itself
for
the
movement
continued
in
a
vertiginous
crescendo
spaniardism
culminated
in
bourbonism
and
this
again
reached
its
climax
in
the
closing
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
the
conditions
of
south
italy
baffled
description
i
have
already
given
the
formidable
number
of
its
ecclesiastics
the
number
of
saints
was
commensurate
but
as
often
happens
when
the
quantity
is
excessive
the
quality
declined
this
was
the
debacle
of
holiness
so
true
it
is
that
our
gods
reflect
the
hearts
that
make
them
the
venerable
fra
egidio
a
native
of
taranto
is
a
good
example
of
contemporary
godliness
my
biography
of
him
was
printed
in
naples
in
footnote
vita
del
venerabile
servo
di
dio
fra
egidio
da
giuseppe
laico
professo
alcantarino
napoli
and
contains
a
dedicatory
epistle
addressed
to
the
blessed
virgin
by
her
servant
subject
and
most
loving
son
rosario
frungillo
a
canon
of
the
church
and
the
author
of
the
book
this
taumaturgo
could
perform
all
the
ordinary
feats
i
will
not
linger
over
them
what
has
made
him
popular
to
this
day
are
those
wonders
which
appealed
to
the
taste
of
the
poorer
people
such
as
for
example
that
miracle
of
the
eels
a
fisherman
had
brought
fourteen
hundredweight
of
these
for
sale
in
the
market
judge
of
his
disappointment
when
he
discovered
that
they
had
all
died
during
the
journey
southerners
will
not
pay
for
dead
eels
fortunately
he
saw
the
saint
arriving
in
a
little
boat
who
informed
him
that
the
eels
were
not
dead
but
only
asleep
and
who
woke
them
up
again
by
means
of
a
relic
of
saint
pasquale
which
he
always
carried
about
with
him
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
devout
praying
during
which
the
perspiration
oozed
from
his
forehead
the
eels
says
the
writer
had
been
dead
and
slimy
but
now
turned
their
bellies
downwards
once
more
and
twisted
about
in
their
usual
spirals
there
began
a
general
weeping
among
the
onlookers
and
the
fame
of
the
miracle
immediately
spread
abroad
he
could
do
the
same
with
lobsters
cows
and
human
beings
thus
a
cow
belonging
to
fra
egidio
monastery
was
once
stolen
by
an
impious
butcher
and
cut
up
into
the
usual
joints
with
a
view
to
a
clandestine
sale
of
the
meat
the
saint
discovered
the
beast
remains
ordered
that
they
should
be
laid
together
on
the
floor
in
the
shape
of
a
living
cow
with
the
entrails
head
and
so
forth
in
their
natural
positions
then
having
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
with
his
cord
upon
the
slaughtered
beast
and
rousing
up
all
his
faith
he
said
in
the
name
of
god
and
of
saint
pasquale
arise
catherine
catherine
was
the
cow
name
at
these
words
the
animal
lowed
shook
itself
and
stood
up
on
its
feet
alive
whole
and
strong
even
as
it
had
been
before
it
was
killed
in
the
case
of
one
of
the
dead
men
whom
he
brought
to
life
the
undertakers
were
already
about
their
sad
task
but
fra
egidio
viewing
the
corpse
remarked
in
his
usual
manner
that
the
man
was
not
dead
but
only
asleep
and
after
a
few
saintly
manipulations
roused
him
from
his
slumber
the
most
portentous
of
his
wonders
however
are
those
which
he
wrought
his
own
by
means
of
his
relics
and
otherwise
they
have
been
sworn
to
by
many
persons
nor
did
his
hand
lose
its
old
cunning
in
these
posthumous
manifestations
with
the
finny
tribe
a
certain
woman
maria
scuotto
was
enabled
to
resuscitate
a
number
of
dead
eels
by
means
of
an
image
of
the
deceased
saint
which
she
cast
among
them
every
one
of
the
statements
in
this
biography
is
drawn
from
the
to
which
i
will
presently
refer
there
were
witnesses
who
deposed
under
the
rigour
and
sanctity
of
oath
to
the
truth
of
these
miracles
and
among
those
who
were
personally
convinced
of
the
venerable
rare
gifts
was
the
royal
family
of
naples
the
archbishop
of
that
town
as
well
as
innumerable
dukes
and
princes
an
embittered
rationalist
would
note
that
the
reading
of
voltaire
at
this
period
was
punished
with
three
years
and
that
several
thousand
citizens
were
hanged
for
expressing
liberal
opinions
he
will
suggest
that
belief
in
the
supernatural
rejected
by
the
thinking
classes
finds
an
abiding
shelter
among
royalty
and
the
proletariat
it
occurs
to
me
a
propos
of
fra
egidio
to
make
the
obvious
statement
that
an
account
of
an
occurrence
is
not
necessarily
true
because
it
happened
long
ago
credibility
does
not
improve
like
violins
and
port
wine
with
lapse
of
years
this
being
the
case
it
will
not
be
considered
objectionable
to
say
that
there
are
certain
deeds
attributed
to
holy
men
of
olden
days
which
to
speak
frankly
are
open
to
doubt
or
at
least
not
susceptible
of
proof
who
were
these
men
if
they
ever
existed
and
who
vouches
for
their
prodigies
this
makes
me
think
that
pope
gelasius
showed
no
small
penetration
in
excluding
as
early
as
the
fifth
century
some
few
from
the
use
of
the
churches
another
step
in
the
same
direction
was
taken
in
the
twelfth
century
when
the
power
of
canonizing
saints
which
had
hitherto
been
claimed
by
all
bishops
became
vested
in
the
pope
alone
and
yet
another
when
urban
viii
forbade
the
nomination
of
local
patron
saints
by
popular
vote
pious
legends
are
supposed
to
have
their
uses
as
an
educative
agency
so
be
it
but
such
relations
of
imperfectly
ascertained
and
therefore
questionable
wonders
suffer
from
one
grave
drawback
they
tend
to
shake
our
faith
in
the
evidence
of
ones
thus
saint
patrick
is
also
reported
to
have
raised
a
cow
from
the
dead
five
cows
to
be
quite
accurate
but
who
will
come
forward
and
vouch
for
the
fact
no
one
that
is
because
saint
patrick
belongs
to
the
legendary
stage
he
died
it
is
presumed
about
here
with
saint
egidio
we
are
on
other
ground
on
the
ground
of
bald
actuality
he
expired
in
and
the
contemporaries
who
have
attested
his
miraculous
deeds
are
not
misty
phantoms
of
the
thebais
they
were
creatures
of
flesh
and
blood
human
historical
personages
who
were
dressed
and
nourished
and
educated
after
the
fashion
of
our
own
grandfathers
yet
it
was
meet
and
proper
that
the
documentary
evidence
as
to
his
divine
graces
should
be
conscientiously
examined
and
only
in
was
the
crowning
work
accomplished
in
that
year
his
holiness
leo
xiii
and
the
sacred
congregation
of
cardinals
solemnly
approved
the
evidence
and
inscribed
the
name
of
egidio
in
the
book
of
the
blessed
to
touch
upon
a
few
minor
matters
i
observe
that
fra
egidio
like
the
flying
monk
was
illiterate
and
similarly
preserved
up
to
a
decrepit
age
the
odorous
lily
of
purity
which
made
him
appear
in
words
and
deeds
as
a
most
innocent
child
he
was
accustomed
to
worship
before
a
favourite
picture
of
the
mother
of
god
which
he
kept
adorned
with
candles
and
whenever
the
supply
of
these
ran
out
he
was
wont
to
address
her
with
infantile
simplicity
of
heart
and
in
the
local
dialect
now
there
no
wax
for
you
so
think
about
it
yourself
if
not
have
to
go
without
the
note
but
there
is
this
difference
between
him
and
earlier
saints
that
whereas
they
all
too
often
suffered
in
solitude
misunderstood
and
rejected
of
men
he
enjoyed
the
highest
popularity
during
his
whole
long
life
wherever
he
went
his
footsteps
were
pursued
by
crowds
of
admirers
eager
to
touch
his
body
or
to
cut
off
shreds
of
his
clothing
as
amulets
hardly
a
day
passed
that
he
did
not
return
home
with
garments
so
lacerated
that
only
half
of
them
was
left
every
evening
they
had
to
be
patched
up
anew
although
they
were
purposely
stitched
full
of
wires
and
small
chains
of
iron
as
a
protection
the
same
passionate
sympathy
continued
after
death
for
while
his
body
was
lying
in
state
a
certain
luigi
ascione
a
surgeon
pushed
through
the
crowd
and
endeavoured
to
cut
off
one
of
his
with
the
flesh
attached
to
it
he
admitted
being
driven
to
this
act
of
pious
depredation
by
the
pleading
request
of
the
spanish
ambassador
and
a
neapolitan
princess
who
held
fra
egidio
in
great
veneration
this
is
not
an
isolated
instance
southerners
love
their
saints
and
do
not
content
themselves
with
chill
verbal
expressions
of
esteem
so
the
biographer
of
saint
giangiuseppe
records
that
one
of
the
deceased
saint
toes
was
bitten
off
with
most
devotion
by
the
teeth
of
a
man
in
the
crowd
who
wished
to
preserve
it
as
a
relic
and
the
blood
from
the
wound
flowed
so
copiously
and
so
freely
that
many
pieces
of
cloth
were
saturated
with
it
nor
did
it
cease
to
flow
till
the
precious
corpse
was
interred
it
is
hard
to
picture
such
proofs
of
fervid
popularity
falling
to
the
lot
of
english
deans
and
bishops
he
was
modern
too
in
this
sense
that
he
did
not
torment
himself
with
penitences
decay
of
spanish
austerity
on
the
contrary
he
even
kept
chocolate
honey
and
suchlike
delicacies
in
his
cell
in
short
he
was
an
saint
who
despised
mediaeval
practices
and
lived
in
a
manner
befitting
the
age
which
gave
him
birth
in
this
respect
he
resembles
our
english
men
of
holiness
who
exercise
a
laudable
in
resisting
the
seductions
of
the
ascetic
life
meanwhile
the
cult
of
the
mother
of
god
continued
to
wax
in
favour
and
those
who
are
interested
in
its
development
should
read
the
really
remarkable
book
by
antonio
cuomó
saggio
apologetico
della
belezza
celeste
e
divina
di
maria
madre
di
dio
castellamare
it
is
a
diatribe
against
modernism
by
a
champion
of
lost
causes
an
exacerbated
lover
of
the
singular
virgin
and
fecund
mother
of
the
verb
his
argument
as
i
understand
it
is
the
theory
applied
to
the
virgin
mary
in
defence
of
this
thesis
the
book
has
been
made
to
bristle
with
quotations
they
stand
out
like
quills
upon
the
porcupine
ready
to
impale
the
adventurous
sceptic
pliny
and
virgil
and
the
druids
and
balaam
ass
are
invoked
as
foretelling
her
birth
the
old
testament
that
venerable
sufferer
as
huxley
called
it
is
twisted
into
dire
convulsions
for
the
same
purpose
much
evidence
is
also
drawn
from
hebrew
observances
and
from
the
church
fathers
but
the
new
testamentary
record
is
seldom
invoked
the
saviour
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
is
mentioned
being
dismissed
as
the
volume
ends
with
a
pyrotechnical
display
of
invective
against
heretics
a
medley
of
threats
and
abuse
worthy
of
those
breezy
days
of
erasmus
when
theologians
really
said
what
they
thought
of
each
other
the
frank
polytheism
of
montorio
is
more
to
my
taste
this
outpouring
of
papistical
rhetoric
gives
me
unwarrantable
sensations
it
makes
me
feel
positively
protestant
another
sign
of
increasing
popularity
is
that
the
sacred
bacchanals
connected
with
the
crowning
of
various
madonnas
were
twice
as
numerous
in
naples
in
the
nineteenth
as
in
the
eighteenth
century
why
an
image
of
the
mother
of
god
should
be
decked
with
this
worldly
symbol
as
a
reward
for
services
rendered
will
be
obscure
only
to
those
who
fail
to
appreciate
the
complexion
of
southern
religion
puerility
is
its
the
italian
is
either
puerile
or
adult
the
englishman
remains
everlastingly
adolescent
now
of
course
it
is
open
to
any
one
to
say
that
the
pious
records
from
which
i
have
quoted
are
a
desolation
of
the
spirit
that
they
possess
all
the
improbability
of
the
arabian
nights
and
none
of
their
charm
that
all
the
distempered
dreamings
to
which
our
poor
humanity
is
subject
have
given
themselves
a
rendezvous
in
their
pages
i
am
not
for
disputing
the
point
and
i
can
understand
how
one
man
may
be
saddened
by
their
perusal
while
another
extracts
therefrom
some
gleams
of
mirth
for
my
part
i
merely
verify
this
fact
the
native
has
been
fed
with
this
stuff
for
centuries
and
if
we
desire
to
enter
into
his
feelings
we
must
feed
ourselves
likewise
up
to
a
point
the
past
is
the
key
to
the
present
that
is
why
i
have
dwelt
at
such
length
on
the
subject
in
the
hope
of
clearing
up
the
enigma
in
the
national
character
the
unpassable
gulf
i
mean
between
the
believing
and
the
unbelieving
sections
of
the
community
an
arriving
at
bagnara
and
witnessing
a
procession
in
honour
of
that
sacred
hat
of
the
mother
of
god
which
has
led
me
into
this
disquisition
would
be
shocked
at
the
degree
of
bigotry
implied
the
hat
of
the
virgin
mary
he
would
say
what
next
then
accosting
some
ordinary
citizen
not
in
the
procession
any
butcher
or
baker
he
would
receive
a
shock
of
another
kind
he
would
be
appalled
at
the
language
of
contemptuous
derision
towards
everything
which
he
the
holds
sacred
in
biblical
tradition
there
is
no
attempt
here
at
reconciliation
the
classes
calling
themselves
enlightened
are
making
a
clean
sweep
of
the
old
gods
in
a
fashion
that
bewilders
us
who
have
accustomed
ourselves
to
see
a
providential
design
in
everything
that
exists
possibly
because
our
acquaintance
with
a
holy
office
is
limited
to
an
obsolete
statute
the
genial
haeretico
comburendo
the
others
the
fetishists
have
remained
on
the
spiritual
level
of
their
own
saints
and
there
we
stand
today
that
section
so
numerous
in
england
the
or
whatever
obscurantists
like
balfour
and
mallock
like
to
call
themselves
the
men
who
with
disastrous
effects
transport
into
realms
of
pure
intelligence
the
spirit
of
compromise
which
should
be
restricted
to
practical
concerns
that
section
has
no
representatives
hereabouts
fully
to
appreciate
their
attitude
as
opposed
to
ours
we
must
also
remember
that
the
south
italian
does
not
trouble
himself
about
the
objective
truth
of
any
miracle
whatever
his
senses
may
be
perverted
but
his
intelligence
remains
outside
the
sphere
of
infection
this
is
his
saving
grace
to
the
people
here
the
affair
of
moses
and
the
burning
bush
the
raising
of
lazarus
and
egidio
are
on
the
identical
plane
of
authenticity
the
bible
is
one
of
a
thousand
saints
books
its
stories
may
be
as
true
as
theirs
or
just
as
untrue
in
any
case
what
has
that
to
do
with
his
own
worldly
conduct
but
the
englishman
with
ingenuous
ardour
thinks
to
believe
in
the
burning
bush
wonder
and
in
so
far
his
intelligence
is
infected
with
equal
ardour
he
excludes
the
from
the
range
of
possibility
and
to
him
it
matters
considerably
which
of
the
miracles
are
true
and
which
are
false
seeing
that
his
conduct
is
supposed
to
take
colour
from
such
supernatural
events
as
to
one
set
of
narratives
he
has
no
credulity
left
for
other
sets
he
concentrates
his
believing
energies
upon
a
small
space
whereas
the
italian
are
diffused
thinly
over
a
wide
area
it
is
the
old
story
gothic
intensity
and
latin
spaciousness
so
the
gothic
believer
takes
his
big
dose
of
irrationalism
on
one
fixed
day
the
latin
by
attending
mass
every
morning
spreads
it
over
the
whole
week
and
the
sombre
strenuousness
of
our
northern
character
expects
a
remuneration
for
this
outlay
of
faith
while
the
other
contents
himself
with
such
sensuous
enjoyment
as
he
can
momentarily
extract
from
his
ceremonials
that
is
why
our
english
religion
has
a
tinge
distasteful
to
the
latin
who
at
bottom
is
always
a
philosopher
democratic
because
it
relies
for
its
success
like
democratic
politicians
upon
promises
promises
that
may
or
may
not
be
kept
promises
that
form
no
part
they
are
only
an
official
appendage
of
the
childlike
paganism
of
the
south
fifteen
francs
will
buy
you
a
reliable
witness
for
a
south
italian
lawsuit
you
must
pay
a
good
deal
more
in
england
thence
one
might
argue
that
the
cult
of
credulity
implied
by
these
saintly
biographies
is
responsible
for
this
laxness
for
the
general
disregard
of
veracity
i
doubt
it
i
am
not
inclined
to
blame
the
monkish
for
this
particular
trait
i
suspect
that
for
fifteen
francs
you
could
have
bought
a
witness
under
pericles
southerners
are
not
yet
pressed
for
time
and
when
people
are
not
pressed
for
time
they
do
not
learn
the
value
of
honesty
our
respect
for
truth
and
fair
dealing
such
as
it
is
derives
from
modern
commerce
in
the
middle
ages
nobody
was
concerned
about
honesty
save
a
few
trading
companies
like
the
hanseatic
league
and
the
poor
mediaeval
devil
the
only
gentleman
of
his
age
who
was
generally
pressed
for
time
and
could
be
relied
upon
to
keep
his
word
even
god
of
whom
they
talked
so
much
was
systematically
swindled
where
time
counts
for
nothing
expeditious
practices
between
man
and
man
are
a
drug
in
the
market
besides
it
must
be
noted
that
this
churchly
misteaching
was
only
a
fraction
of
that
general
shattering
which
has
disintegrated
all
the
finer
fibres
of
public
life
it
stands
to
reason
that
the
fragile
tissues
of
culture
are
dislocated
and
its
delicate
edges
defaced
by
such
persistive
governmental
brutalization
as
the
inhabitants
have
undergone
none
but
the
grossest
elements
in
a
people
can
withstand
enduring
misrule
none
but
a
mendacious
and
servile
nature
will
survive
its
wear
and
tear
so
it
comes
about
that
up
to
a
few
years
ago
the
nobler
qualities
which
we
associate
with
those
old
hellenic
colonists
their
intellectual
curiosity
their
candid
outlook
upon
life
their
passionate
sense
of
beauty
their
love
of
nature
all
these
things
had
been
abraded
leaving
as
residue
nothing
save
what
the
greeks
shared
with
ruder
races
there
are
indications
that
this
state
of
affairs
is
now
ending
the
position
is
this
the
records
show
that
the
common
people
never
took
their
saints
to
heart
in
the
northern
fashion
as
moral
exemplars
from
beginning
to
end
they
have
only
utilized
them
as
a
pretext
for
fun
and
festivals
a
means
of
brightening
the
the
essentially
sunless
character
of
christianity
so
much
for
the
popular
saints
the
patrons
and
heroes
the
others
the
ecclesiastical
ones
are
an
artificial
product
of
monkish
institutions
these
monkeries
were
established
in
the
land
by
virtue
of
civil
authority
their
continued
existence
however
was
contingent
upon
the
goodwill
of
the
vatican
one
of
the
surest
and
cheapest
methods
of
obtaining
this
goodwill
was
to
produce
a
satisfactory
crop
of
saints
whose
beatification
swelled
the
vatican
treasury
with
the
millions
collected
from
a
deluded
populace
for
that
end
the
monks
paid
nothing
they
only
furnished
the
saint
and
in
due
course
the
people
money
can
we
wonder
that
they
discovered
saints
galore
can
we
wonder
that
the
popes
were
gratified
by
their
pious
zeal
so
things
went
on
till
yesterday
but
now
a
large
proportion
of
the
ten
thousand
churches
and
monasteries
of
naples
are
closed
or
actually
in
ruins
wayside
sanctuaries
crumble
to
dust
in
picturesque
fashion
the
price
of
holy
books
has
fallen
to
zero
and
the
godly
brethren
have
emigrated
to
establish
their
elsewhere
not
without
hope
of
success
for
they
will
find
purchasers
of
their
wares
wherever
mankind
can
be
interested
in
that
queer
disrespect
of
the
body
which
is
taught
by
the
metaphysical
ascetics
of
the
east
it
was
lewes
i
believe
who
compared
metaphysics
to
ghosts
by
saying
that
there
was
no
killing
either
of
them
one
could
only
dissipate
them
by
throwing
light
into
the
dark
places
they
love
to
inhabit
to
show
that
nothing
is
there
spectres
likewise
are
these
saintly
caricatures
of
humanity
perambulating
metaphysics
the
application
corpore
of
oriental
fakirism
is
the
crazy
recital
of
their
deeds
and
sufferings
pathological
phantoms
the
state
of
mind
which
engenders
and
cherishes
such
illusions
is
a
disease
and
it
has
been
well
said
that
you
can
not
refute
a
disease
you
can
not
nail
ghosts
to
the
counter
but
a
ray
of
light
xxxii
aspromonte
the
day
was
barely
dawning
when
we
left
delianuova
and
began
the
long
and
weary
climb
up
montalto
chestnuts
gave
way
to
beeches
but
the
summit
receded
ever
further
from
us
and
even
before
reaching
the
uplands
the
piano
di
carmelia
we
encountered
a
bank
of
bad
weather
a
glance
at
the
map
will
show
that
montalto
must
be
a
drawing
to
its
flanks
every
wreath
of
vapour
that
rises
from
ionian
and
tyrrhenian
a
west
wind
was
blowing
that
morning
and
thick
fogs
clung
to
the
skirts
of
the
peak
we
reached
the
summit
metres
at
last
drenched
in
an
icy
bath
of
rain
and
sleet
and
with
fingers
so
numbed
that
we
could
hardly
hold
our
sticks
of
the
superb
view
for
such
it
must
be
nothing
whatever
was
to
be
seen
we
were
wrapped
in
a
glacial
mist
on
the
highest
point
stands
a
figure
of
the
redeemer
it
was
dragged
up
in
pieces
from
delianuova
some
seven
years
ago
but
soon
injured
by
frosts
it
has
lately
been
refashioned
the
original
structure
may
be
due
to
the
same
pious
stimulus
as
that
which
placed
the
crosses
on
monte
vulture
and
other
peaks
throughout
the
country
a
counterblast
to
the
rationalistic
congress
at
rome
in
when
giordano
bruno
became
for
a
while
the
hero
of
the
country
this
statue
does
not
lack
dignity
the
regard
turns
towards
reggio
the
capital
of
the
province
and
one
hand
is
upraised
in
calm
and
godlike
benediction
passing
through
magnificent
groves
of
fir
we
descended
rapidly
into
anothsr
climate
into
realms
of
golden
sunshine
among
these
trees
i
espied
what
has
become
quite
a
rare
bird
in
italy
the
common
the
few
that
remain
have
been
driven
into
the
most
secluded
recesses
of
the
mountains
it
was
different
in
the
days
of
theocritus
who
sang
of
this
amiable
fowl
when
the
climate
was
colder
and
the
woodlands
reached
as
far
as
the
now
barren
seashore
to
the
firs
succeeded
long
stretches
of
odorous
pines
interspersed
with
mediterranean
heath
brayère
which
here
grows
to
a
height
of
twelve
feet
one
thinks
of
the
number
of
briar
pipes
that
could
be
cut
out
of
its
knotty
roots
a
british
at
reggio
kerrich
started
this
industry
about
the
year
he
collected
the
roots
which
were
sawn
into
blocks
and
then
sent
to
france
and
america
to
be
made
into
pipes
this
calabrian
briar
was
considered
superior
to
the
french
kind
and
kerrich
had
large
sales
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
his
chief
difficulty
was
want
of
labour
owing
to
emigration
we
passed
by
the
wayside
several
rude
crosses
marking
the
site
of
accidents
or
murders
as
well
as
a
large
heap
of
stones
lie
the
bones
of
a
man
who
attempted
to
traverse
these
mountains
in
and
was
frozen
to
death
they
found
him
the
guide
told
me
in
spring
when
the
snow
melted
from
off
his
body
there
he
lay
all
fresh
and
comely
it
looked
as
if
he
would
presently
wake
up
and
continue
his
march
but
he
neither
spoke
nor
stirred
then
they
knew
he
was
dead
and
they
piled
all
these
stones
over
him
to
prevent
the
wolves
you
understand
aspromonte
deserves
its
name
it
is
an
incredibly
harsh
agglomeration
of
hill
and
dale
and
the
geology
of
the
district
as
i
learned
long
ago
from
my
friend
professor
cortese
reveals
a
perfect
chaos
of
rocks
of
every
age
torn
into
gullies
by
earthquakes
and
other
cataclysms
of
the
past
at
one
place
near
scido
is
an
old
stream
of
lava
once
the
higher
ground
the
nucleus
of
the
group
is
left
behind
the
wanderer
finds
himself
lost
in
a
maze
of
contorted
ravines
winding
about
without
any
apparent
system
of
watershed
does
the
liquid
flow
north
or
south
who
can
tell
the
track
crawls
in
and
out
of

mounts
upwards
to
heights
of
bracken

hemmed
in
by

by

of
crystal
clearness
rises
afresh
in
endless
gyrations
under
the
pines
only
to
vanish
yet
again
into
the
twilight
of
deeper
abysses
where
it
skirts
the
rivulet
along
precarious
ledges
until
some
new
obstruction
blocks
the
way
so
it
writhes
about
for
long
long
hours
here
on
the
spot
one
can
understand
how
an
outlaw
like
musolino
was
enabled
to
defy
justice
helped
as
he
was
by
the
fact
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
inhabitants
were
favourable
to
him
and
that
the
officer
in
charge
of
his
pursuers
was
paid
a
fixed
sum
for
every
day
he
spent
in
the
chase
and
presumably
found
it
convenient
not
to
discover
his
whereabouts
footnote
see
next
chapter
we
rested
awhile
during
these
interminable
meanderings
under
the
shadow
of
a
group
of
pines
do
you
see
that
square
patch
yonder
said
my
man
it
is
a
cornfield
there
musolino
shot
one
of
his
enemies
whom
he
suspected
of
giving
information
to
the
police
it
was
well
done
how
many
did
he
shoot
altogether
only
eighteen
and
three
of
them
recovered
more
or
less
enough
to
limp
about
at
all
events
ah
if
you
could
have
seen
him
sir
he
was
young
with
curly
fair
hair
and
a
face
like
a
rose
god
alone
can
tell
how
many
poor
people
he
helped
in
their
distress
and
any
young
girl
he
met
in
the
mountains
he
would
help
with
her
load
and
accompany
as
far
as
her
home
right
into
her
father
house
which
none
of
us
would
have
risked
however
much
we
might
have
liked
it
but
every
one
knew
that
he
was
pure
as
an
angel
and
there
was
a
young
fellow
here
he
went
on
who
thought
he
could
profit
by
pretending
to
be
musolino
so
one
day
he
challenged
a
proprietor
with
his
gun
and
took
all
his
money
when
it
came
to
musolino
ears
he
was
furious
furious
he
lay
in
wait
for
him
caught
him
and
said
dare
you
touch
fathers
of
children
where
that
money
you
took
from
don
antonio
then
the
boy
began
to
cry
and
tremble
for
his
life
it
said
musolino
penny
at
midday
next
monday
to
such
and
such
a
spot
or
else
of
course
he
brought
it
then
he
marched
him
straight
into
the
proprietor
house
this
wretched
boy
who
robbed
you
in
my
name
and
here
the
money
please
count
it
now
what
shall
we
do
with
him
so
don
antonio
counted
the
money
all
there
he
said
him
off
this
time
then
musolino
turned
to
the
lad
have
behaved
like
a
mannerless
puppy
he
said
shame
or
knowledge
of
the
world
be
reasonable
in
future
and
understand
clearly
i
will
have
no
brigandage
in
these
mountains
leave
that
to
the
syndics
and
judges
in
the
towns
we
did
not
traverse
musolino
natal
village
santo
stefano
indeed
we
passed
through
no
villages
at
all
but
after
issuing
from
the
labyrinth
we
saw
a
few
of
them
perched
in
improbable
situations
roccaforte
and
roghudi
on
our
right
on
the
other
side
africo
and
casalnuovo
salis
marschlins
says
that
the
inhabitants
of
these
regions
are
so
wild
and
innocent
that
money
is
unknown
everything
is
done
by
barter
that
comes
of
copying
without
discrimination
for
this
statement
he
utilized
the
report
of
a
government
official
a
certain
leoni
who
was
sent
hither
after
the
earthquake
of
and
found
the
use
of
money
not
unknown
but
forgotten
in
consequence
of
this
terrible
catastrophe
these
vales
of
aspromonte
are
one
of
the
last
refuges
of
living
byzantinism
greek
is
still
spoken
in
some
places
such
as
and
roghudi
earlier
travellers
confused
the
natives
with
the
albanians
niehbuhr
who
had
an
obsession
on
the
subject
of
hellenism
imagined
they
were
relics
of
old
dorian
and
achaean
colonies
scholars
are
apparently
not
yet
quite
decided
upon
certain
smaller
matters
so
lenormant
vol
ii
thinks
they
came
hither
after
the
turkish
conquest
as
did
the
albanians
batiffol
argues
that
they
were
chased
into
calabria
from
sicily
by
the
arabs
after
the
second
half
of
the
seventh
century
morosi
who
treats
mostly
of
their
apulian
settlements
says
that
they
came
from
the
east
between
the
sixth
and
tenth
centuries
many
students
such
as
morelli
and
comparetti
have
garnered
their
songs
language
customs
and
lore
and
whoever
wants
a
convenient
résumé
of
these
earlier
researches
will
find
it
in
pellegrini
book
which
was
written
in
printed
he
gives
the
number
of
greek
inhabitants
of
these
places
roghudi
for
example
had
in
his
day
he
has
also
noted
down
these
villages
like
africo
and
casalnuovo
in
which
the
byzantine
speech
has
lately
been
lost
bova
and
condofuri
are
now
the
of
mediaeval
greek
in
these
parts
from
afar
we
had
already
descried
a
green
range
of
hills
that
shut
out
the
seaward
view
this
we
now
began
to
climb
in
wearisome
ascension
it
is
called
because
your
feet
are
all
the
time
on
a
steep
incline
telegraph
wires
here
accompany
the
track
a
survival
of
the
war
between
the
italian
government
and
musolino
on
the
summit
lies
a
lonely
alp
campo
di
bova
where
a
herd
of
cattle
were
pasturing
under
the
care
of
a
youth
who
lay
supine
on
the
grass
gazing
at
the
clouds
as
they
drifted
in
stately
procession
across
the
firmament
save
for
a
dusky
crouching
in
a
cave
this
boy
was
the
only
living
person
we
encountered
on
our
march
so
deserted
are
these
mountain
tracks
at
campo
di
bova
a
path
branches
off
to
staiti
the
sea
is
visible
once
more
and
there
are
fine
glimpses
on
the
left
towards
staiti
or
is
it
ferruzzano
and
down
the
right
into
the
destructive
and
dangerous
torrent
of
amendolea
far
beyond
it
rises
the
mountain
peak
of
pentedattilo
a
most
singular
landmark
which
looks
exactly
like
a
molar
tooth
turned
upside
down
with
fangs
in
air
the
road
passes
through
a
gateway
in
the
rock
whence
suddenly
a
full
view
is
disclosed
of
bova
on
its
the
houses
nestling
among
huge
blocks
of
stone
that
make
one
think
of
some
cyclopean
citadel
of
past
ages
my
guide
stoutly
denied
that
this
was
bova
the
town
he
declared
lay
in
quite
another
direction
i
imagine
he
had
never
been
beyond
the
foot
of
the
pie
here
once
more
the
late
earthquake
has
done
some
damage
and
there
is
a
row
of
trim
wooden
shelters
near
the
entrance
of
the
town
i
may
add
as
a
picturesque
detail
that
about
of
them
have
never
been
inhabited
and
are
never
likely
to
be
they
were
erected
in
the
heat
of
enthusiasm
and
there
they
will
stay
empty
and
abandoned
until
some
energetic
mayor
shall
pull
them
down
and
cook
his
maccheroni
with
their
timber
evening
was
drawing
on
apace
and
whether
it
was
due
to
the
joy
of
having
accomplished
an
arduous
journey
or
to
inconsiderate
potations
of
the
bacchus
of
bova
one
of
the
most
remarkable
wines
in
italy
i
very
soon
found
myself
on
excellent
terms
with
the
chief
citizens
of
this
rather
little
place
a
good
deal
has
been
written
concerning
bova
and
its
inhabitants
but
i
should
say
there
is
still
a
mine
of
information
to
be
exploited
on
the
spot
they
are
bilingual
but
while
clinging
stubbornly
to
their
old
speech
they
have
now
embraced
catholicism
the
town
kept
its
greek
religious
rites
till
the
latter
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
rodota
has
described
the
vigorous
resistance
that
was
made
to
the
introduction
of
romanism
and
the
ceremonies
which
finally
accompanied
that
event
mine
hostess
obligingly
sang
me
two
or
three
songs
in
her
native
language
the
priest
furnished
me
with
curious
statistics
of
folklore
and
criminology
and
the
notary
with
whom
i
conversed
awhile
on
the
tiny
piazza
that
overlooks
the
coastlands
and
distant
ionian
was
a
most
affable
gentleman
seeing
that
the
christian
names
of
the
populace
are
purely
italian
i
enquired
as
to
their
surnames
and
learned
what
i
expected
namely
that
a
good
many
greek
family
names
survive
among
the
people
his
own
name
he
said
was
unquestionably
greek
if
i
liked
he
would
go
through
the
local
archives
and
prepare
me
a
list
of
all
such
surnames
as
appeared
to
him
to
be
we
could
thus
obtain
some
idea
of
the
percentage
of
greek
families
still
living
here
my
best
thanks
to
the
good
signor
after
some
further
liquid
refreshment
a
youthful
native
volunteered
to
guide
me
by
short
cuts
to
the
remote
railway
station
we
stepped
blithely
into
the
twilight
and
during
the
long
descent
i
discoursed
with
him
in
fluent
byzantine
greek
of
the
affairs
of
his
village
it
is
my
theory
that
among
a
populace
of
this
kind
the
words
relative
to
agricultural
pursuits
will
be
those
which
are
least
likely
to
suffer
change
with
lapse
of
years
or
to
be
replaced
by
others
acting
on
this
principle
i
put
him
through
a
catechism
on
the
subject
as
soon
as
we
reached
our
destination
and
was
surprised
at
the
relative
scarcity
of
italian
terms
barely
per
cent
i
should
say
needless
to
add
i
omitted
to
note
them
down
such
as
it
is
be
that
my
contribution
to
the
literature
of
these
sporadic
islets
of
mediaeval
hellenism
whose
outstanding
features
are
being
gnawed
away
by
the
waves
of
military
conscription
governmental
schooling
and
emigration
caulonia
my
next
lay
far
off
the
line
i
had
therefore
the
choice
of
spending
the
night
at
gerace
old
locri
or
rocella
ionica
intermediate
stations
both
of
them
to
my
knowledge
possessing
indifferent
accommodation
i
chose
the
former
as
being
the
nearest
and
slept
there
not
amiss
far
better
than
on
a
previous
occasion
when
certain
things
occurred
which
need
not
be
set
down
here
the
trip
from
delianuova
over
the
summit
of
montalto
to
bova
railway
station
is
by
no
means
to
be
recommended
to
young
boys
or
persons
in
delicate
health
allowing
for
only
minutes
rest
it
took
me
fourteen
hours
to
walk
to
the
town
of
bova
and
the
railway
station
lies
nearly
three
hours
apart
from
that
place
there
is
hardly
a
level
yard
of
ground
along
the
whole
route
and
though
my
guide
twice
took
the
wrong
track
and
thereby
probably
lost
me
some
little
time
i
question
whether
the
best
walker
provided
as
i
was
with
the
best
maps
will
be
able
to
traverse
the
distance
in
less
than
fifteen
hours
whoever
he
is
i
wish
him
joy
of
his
journey
pleasant
to
recall
assuredly
the
scenery
and
the
mountain
flowers
are
wondrously
beautiful
but
i
have
fully
realized
what
the
men
of
delianuova
meant
when
they
said
to
montalto
yes
to
bova
no
xxxiii
musolino
and
the
law
musolino
will
remain
a
hero
for
many
long
years
to
come
he
did
his
duty
such
is
the
popular
verdict
on
his
career
he
was
not
a
brigand
but
an
unfortunate
a
martyr
a
victim
of
the
law
so
he
is
described
not
only
by
his
but
by
the
writers
of
many
hundred
serious
pamphlets
in
every
province
of
italy
at
any
bookstall
you
may
buy
cheap
illustrated
tracts
and
poems
setting
forth
his
achievements
in
cosenza
i
saw
a
play
of
which
he
was
the
leading
figure
depicted
as
a
pale
gentleman
of
the
misunderstood
type
friend
of
the
fatherless
champion
of
widows
and
orphans
rectifier
of
all
wrongs
in
fact
as
the
embodiment
of
those
virtues
which
we
are
apt
to
associate
with
prometheus
or
the
founder
of
christianity
only
to
those
who
know
nothing
of
local
conditions
will
it
seem
strange
to
say
that
italian
law
is
one
of
the
factors
that
contribute
to
the
disintegration
of
family
life
throughout
the
country
and
to
the
production
of
creatures
like
musolino
there
are
few
villages
which
do
not
contain
some
notorious
assassins
who
have
escaped
punishment
under
sentimental
pleas
and
now
terrorize
the
neighbourhood
this
is
one
of
the
evils
which
derange
patriarchalism
the
living
in
fear
of
their
lives
the
others
with
a
conspicuous
example
before
their
eyes
of
the
advantages
of
and
another
is
that
the
innocent
often
suffer
lads
being
locked
up
for
months
and
years
in
prison
on
the
flimsiest
pretexts
often
on
the
mere
word
of
some
malevolent
local
policeman
among
hardened
habitual
offenders
if
they
survive
the
treatment
which
is
not
always
the
case
they
return
home
completely
demoralized
and
a
source
of
infection
to
others
it
is
hardly
surprising
if
under
such
conditions
rich
and
poor
alike
are
ready
to
hide
a
picturesque
fugitive
from
justice
a
sad
state
of
affairs
but
as
an
unsavoury
italian
proverb
correctly
says
pesce
puzza
dal
for
the
fault
lies
not
only
in
the
fundamental
perversity
of
all
roman
law
it
lies
also
in
the
local
administration
of
that
law
which
is
inefficient
and
marked
by
that
elaborate
brutality
characteristic
of
all
philosophic
and
nations
one
thinks
of
the
byzantines
that
justices
should
be
gentlemen
cognizant
of
their
duties
to
society
that
carbineers
and
other
should
be
civilly
responsible
for
outrages
upon
the
public
that
a
act
might
be
as
useful
here
as
among
certain
savages
of
the
north
that
the
baghdad
system
of
delays
leads
to
corruption
of
underpaid
officials
and
witnesses
alike
not
to
speak
of
judges
in
a
word
that
the
method
pursued
hereabouts
is
calculated
to
create
rather
than
to
repress
crime
these
are
truths
of
too
elementary
a
nature
to
find
their
way
into
the
brains
of
the
megalomaniac
rhetoricians
who
control
their
country
fate
they
will
never
endorse
that
saying
of
stendhal
in
italy
with
the
exception
of
milan
the
is
the
preface
of
all
civilization
to
this
day
the
proportion
of
murders
is
still
per
cent
higher
in
palermo
than
in
milan
speak
to
the
wisest
judges
of
the
horrors
of
cellular
confinement
such
as
musolino
was
enduring
up
to
a
short
time
ago
as
opposed
to
capital
punishment
and
you
will
learn
that
they
invoke
the
humanitarian
beccaria
in
justification
of
it
theorists
for
less
formidable
criminals
there
exists
that
wondrous
institution
of
coatto
which
i
have
studied
in
the
islands
of
lipari
and
ponza
these
seldom
try
to
escape
life
is
far
too
comfortable
and
the
wine
good
and
cheap
often
on
completing
their
sentences
they
get
themselves
condemned
anew
in
order
to
return
the
man
may
well
envy
their
lot
for
they
recuve
free
lodging
from
the
government
a
daily
allowance
of
money
and
two
new
suits
of
clothes
a
year
they
are
not
asked
to
do
a
stroke
of
work
in
return
but
may
lie
in
bed
all
day
long
if
so
disposed
the
citizen
meanwhile
pays
for
the
upkeep
of
this
horde
of
malefactors
as
well
as
for
the
army
of
officials
who
are
deputed
to
attend
to
their
wants
this
institution
of
is
one
of
those
things
which
would
be
incredible
were
it
not
actually
in
existence
it
is
a
school
a
school
for
the
promotion
of
criminality
but
what
shall
be
expected
where
judges
sob
like
children
and
jurors
swoon
away
with
emotionalism
where
floods
of
bombast
go
to
the
courts
and
listen
take
the
place
of
and
affidavits
where
perjury
is
a
humanly
venial
and
almost
praiseworthy
failing
how
shall
the
code
defective
as
it
is
be
administered
rhetoric
and
rhetoric
alone
sways
the
decision
of
the
courts
scholars
are
only
now
beginning
to
realize
to
what
an
extent
the
ancient
sense
of
veracity
was
tainted
with
this
vice
how
deeply
all
classical
history
is
permeated
with
elegant
partisan
and
this
evil
legacy
from
days
has
been
augmented
by
the
more
recent
teachings
of
jesuitry
and
the
catholic
theory
of
peccato
veniale
rhetoric
alone
counts
rhetoric
alone
is
art
the
rest
is
mere
facts
and
your
penalista
has
a
constitutional
horror
of
a
bald
fact
because
it
is
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
with
it
it
is
too
crude
a
thing
for
cultured
men
to
handle
if
a
local
barrister
were
forced
to
state
in
court
a
plain
fact
without
varnish
he
would
die
of
cerebral
congestion
the
judge
of
boredom
in
early
times
these
provinces
had
a
cowboy
justice
which
answered
simple
needs
and
when
in
bourbon
days
things
became
more
centralized
there
was
still
a
expedient
each
judge
having
a
fixed
and
publicly
acknowledged
tariff
the
village
elders
in
deserving
cases
subscribed
the
requisite
sum
and
released
their
prisoner
but
italy
is
now
paying
the
penalty
of
ambition
with
one
foot
in
the
ferocity
of
her
past
and
the
other
on
a
quicksand
of
idealism
she
contrives
to
combine
the
disadvantages
of
both
she
who
was
the
light
o
love
of
all
europe
for
long
ages
and
in
her
poverty
denied
nothing
to
her
clientèle
has
now
laid
aside
a
little
money
repenting
of
her
frivolous
and
mercenary
deeds
they
sometimes
do
and
becoming
puritanically
zealous
of
good
works
in
her
old
age
all
this
however
as
might
have
been
expected
from
her
antecedent
career
without
much
discrimination
it
is
certainly
remarkable
that
a
race
of
men
who
have
been
such
ardent
opponents
of
many
forms
of
tyranny
in
the
past
should
still
endure
a
system
of
criminal
procedure
worthy
of
torquemada
high
and
low
cry
out
against
it
but
where
shall
grievances
be
ventilated
in
parliament
a
good
joke
that
in
the
press
better
still
italian
newspapers
nowise
reflect
the
opinions
of
civilized
italy
they
are
mere
in
the
whole
kingdom
there
are
only
three
dailies
the
people
have
learnt
to
despair
of
their
rulers
to
regard
them
with
cynical
suspicion
public
opinion
has
been
crushed
out
of
the
country
what
goes
by
that
name
is
the
gossip
of
the
or
obscure
village
cabals
and
schemings
i
am
quite
aware
that
the
spirit
is
the
slow
growth
of
ages
and
that
a
serious
mischief
like
this
can
not
be
repaired
in
a
short
generation
i
know
that
even
now
the
italian
code
of
criminal
procedure
that
tragic
farce
is
under
revision
i
know
moreover
that
there
are
stipendiary
magistrates
in
south
italy
whose
discernment
and
integrity
would
do
honour
to
our
british
courts
but
take
the
case
out
of
their
hands
into
a
higher
tribunal
and
you
may
put
your
trust
in
god
or
in
your
purse
justice
hereabouts
is
in
the
same
condition
as
it
was
in
egypt
at
the
time
of
lord
dufferin
report
a
mockery
it
may
be
said
that
it
does
not
concern
aliens
to
make
such
criticism
a
fatuous
observation
everything
concerns
everybody
the
foreigner
in
italy
if
he
is
wise
will
familiarize
himself
not
only
with
the
cathedrals
to
be
visited
but
also
and
primarily
with
the
technique
of
legal
bribery
and
subterfuge
with
the
methods
locally
employed
for
escaping
out
of
the
meshes
of
the
law
otherwise
he
may
find
unpleasant
surprises
in
store
for
him
had
mercer
made
it
his
business
to
acquire
some
rudiments
of
this
useful
knowledge
he
would
never
have
undergone
that
outrageous
official
which
has
become
a
byword
in
the
annals
of
international
amenities
and
if
these
strictures
be
considered
too
severe
let
us
see
what
italians
themselves
have
to
say
in
was
published
a
book
called
la
quistione
meridionale
what
wrong
with
the
south
that
throws
a
flood
of
light
upon
local
conditions
it
contains
the
views
of
of
the
most
prominent
men
in
the
country
as
to
how
south
italian
problems
should
be
faced
and
solved
nearly
all
of
them
deplore
the
lack
of
justice
says
professor
colajanni
to
heal
the
south
we
require
an
honest
intelligent
and
sagacious
government
we
have
not
got
and
lombroso
in
the
south
it
is
necessary
to
introduce
justice
does
not
exist
save
in
favour
of
certain
classes
i
am
tempted
to
linger
on
this
subject
not
without
reason
these
people
and
their
attitude
towards
life
will
remain
an
enigma
to
the
traveller
until
he
has
acquainted
himself
with
the
law
of
the
land
and
seen
with
his
own
eyes
something
of
the
atrocious
misery
which
its
administration
involves
a
murderer
like
musolino
crowned
with
an
aureole
of
saintliness
would
be
an
anomaly
in
england
we
should
think
it
rather
paradoxical
to
hear
a
respectable
old
farmer
recommending
his
boys
to
shoot
a
policeman
whenever
they
safely
can
on
the
spot
things
begin
to
wear
a
different
aspect
musolino
is
no
more
to
be
blamed
than
a
child
who
has
been
systematically
misguided
by
his
parents
and
if
these
people
much
as
they
love
their
homes
and
families
are
all
potential
musolinos
they
have
good
reasons
for
it
excellent
reasons
no
south
italian
living
at
this
present
moment
be
he
of
what
social
class
you
please
be
he
of
the
gentlest
blood
or
most
refined
culture
is
on
the
side
of
the
policeman
no
not
the
abuses
of
the
executive
are
too
terrific
to
warrant
such
an
attitude
has
not
the
entire
police
force
of
naples
up
to
its
very
head
been
lately
proved
to
be
in
the
pay
of
the
camorra
to
say
nothing
of
its
connection
with
what
king
and
okey
euphemistically
call
the
unseen
hand
at
rome
a
hand
which
is
held
out
for
blackmail
and
not
vainly
from
the
highest
ministerial
benches
under
such
conditions
the
populace
becomes
profoundly
distrustful
of
the
powers
that
be
and
such
distrust
breeds
bad
citizens
but
so
things
will
remain
until
the
policy
is
applied
to
the
whole
code
of
criminal
procedure
and
to
a
good
half
of
its
present
administrators
the
best
of
no
doubt
is
but
a
compromise
science
being
one
thing
and
public
order
another
the
most
enlightened
of
legislators
may
well
tremble
to
engraft
the
fruits
of
modern
psychological
research
upon
the
tree
of
law
lest
the
scion
prove
too
vigorous
for
the
aged
vegetable
but
some
compromises
are
better
than
others
and
the
italian
code
which
reads
like
a
fairy
tale
and
works
like
a
fury
is
as
bad
a
one
as
human
ingenuity
can
devise
if
a
prisoner
escape
punishment
it
is
due
not
so
much
to
his
innocence
as
to
some
access
of
sanity
or
benevolence
on
the
part
of
the
judge
who
courageously
twists
the
law
in
his
favour
fortunately
such
humane
exponents
of
the
code
are
common
enough
were
it
otherwise
the
prisons
extensive
as
they
are
would
have
to
be
considerably
enlarged
but
that
ideal
judge
who
shall
be
paid
as
befits
his
grave
calling
who
shall
combine
the
honesty
and
common
sense
of
the
north
with
the
analytical
acumen
of
the
south
has
yet
to
be
evolved
what
interests
the
student
of
history
is
that
things
hereabouts
have
not
changed
by
a
hair
since
the
days
of
demosthenes
and
those
preposterous
old
hellenic
tribunals
not
by
a
single
hair
on
the
one
hand
we
have
a
deluge
of
subtle
disquisitions
on
jurisprudence
personal
responsibility
and
so
forth
on
the
other
the
sinister
tomfoolery
known
as
that
is
babble
corruption
palaeolithic
ideas
of
what
constitutes
evidence
and
a
that
reminds
one
of
gilbert
and
sullivan
at
their
best
there
was
a
report
in
the
papers
not
long
ago
of
the
trial
of
an
old
married
couple
on
the
charge
of
murdering
a
young
girl
the
bench
dismissed
the
case
remarking
that
there
was
not
a
particle
of
evidence
against
them
they
had
plainly
been
exemplary
citizens
all
their
long
lives
they
had
spent
five
years
in
prison
awaiting
trial
five
years
and
innocent
it
stands
to
reason
that
such
abuses
disorganize
the
family
especially
in
italy
where
the
family
means
much
more
than
it
does
in
england
the
land
lies
barren
and
savings
are
wasted
in
paying
lawyers
and
bribing
greedy
court
officials
what
are
this
worthy
couple
to
think
of
savoia
once
they
have
issued
from
their
dungeon
i
read
in
yesterday
parliamentary
proceedings
of
an
honourable
member
aprile
rising
to
ask
the
minister
of
justice
gallini
whether
the
time
has
not
come
to
proceed
with
the
trial
of
signori
camerano
and
their
who
have
been
in
prison
for
six
years
charged
with
voluntary
homicide
whereto
his
excellency
sagely
replies
that
la
magistratura
ha
avuto
i
suoi
motivi
the
magistrates
have
had
their
reasons
six
years
in
confinement
and
perhaps
innocent
can
one
wonder
under
such
circumstances
at
the
anarchist
schools
of
prato
and
elsewhere
can
one
wonder
if
even
a
vindictive
and
corrupt
rag
like
the
socialistic
avanti
occasionally
prints
frantic
protests
of
indignation
and
not
a
hundredth
part
of
such
accused
persons
can
cause
a
minister
of
the
crown
to
be
interpellated
on
their
behalf
the
others
suffer
silently
and
often
die
forgotten
in
their
cells
and
yet
how
seriously
we
take
this
nation
almost
as
seriously
as
we
take
ourselves
the
reason
is
that
most
of
us
come
to
italy
too
undiscerning
too
reverent
in
the
and
stages
we
arrive
here
stuffed
with
renaissance
ideals
or
classical
lore
and
viewing
the
present
through
coloured
spectacles
we
arrive
here
above
all
things
too
young
for
youth
loves
to
lean
on
tradition
and
to
draw
inspiration
from
what
has
gone
before
youth
finds
nothing
more
difficult
than
to
follow
goethe
advice
about
grasping
that
living
life
which
shifts
and
fluctuates
about
us
few
writers
are
sufficiently
detached
to
laugh
at
these
people
as
they
together
with
ourselves
so
often
and
so
richly
deserve
i
spoke
of
the
buffoonery
of
italian
law
i
might
have
called
it
a
burlesque
the
trial
of
the
nasi
here
was
a
conducted
by
the
highest
tribunal
of
the
land
and
if
it
was
not
a
burlesque
why
we
must
coin
a
new
word
for
what
is
xxxiv
malaria
a
black
snake
of
alarming
dimensions
one
of
the
monsters
that
still
infest
the
calabrian
lowlands
glided
across
the
roadway
while
i
was
waiting
for
the
post
carriage
to
drive
me
to
caulonia
from
its
auspicious
omen
it
carried
my
thoughts
from
old
aesculapius
to
his
modern
representatives
to
that
school
of
wise
and
disinterested
healers
who
are
ridding
these
regions
of
their
curse
and
with
whom
i
was
soon
to
have
some
nearer
acquaintance
we
started
at
last
in
the
hot
hours
of
the
morning
and
the
road
at
first
skirts
the
banks
of
the
alaro
the
sagra
of
old
on
whose
banks
was
fought
the
fabled
battle
between
the
men
of
croton
and
locri
then
it
begins
to
climb
upwards
my
companion
was
a
poor
peasant
woman
nearly
blind
from
malaria
possibly
full
of
my
impressions
of
yesterday
i
promptly
led
the
conversation
towards
the
subject
of
musolino
she
had
never
spoken
to
him
she
said
or
even
seen
him
but
she
got
ten
francs
from
him
all
the
same
in
dire
distress
some
years
ago
she
had
asked
a
friend
in
the
mountains
to
approach
the
brigand
on
her
behalf
the
money
was
long
in
coming
she
added
but
of
course
it
came
in
the
end
he
always
helped
poor
people
even
those
outside
his
own
country
the
site
of
the
original
caulonia
is
quite
uncertain
excavations
now
going
on
at
monasterace
some
ten
miles
further
on
may
decide
that
the
town
lay
there
some
are
in
favour
of
the
miserable
village
of
foca
near
at
hand
or
of
other
sites
the
name
of
foca
seems
to
point
rather
to
a
settlement
of
the
regenerator
nicephorus
phocas
be
that
as
it
may
the
present
town
of
caulonia
used
to
be
called
castelvetere
and
it
appropriated
the
greek
name
in
accordance
with
a
custom
which
has
been
largely
followed
hereabouts
footnote
it
is
represented
with
two
towers
in
peutinger
tables
but
these
says
an
editor
should
have
been
given
to
the
neighbouring
scilatio
for
caulon
was
in
ruins
at
the
time
of
pliny
and
is
not
even
mentioned
by
ptolemy
servius
makes
another
mistake
he
confuses
the
calabrian
caulon
with
a
locality
of
the
same
name
near
capua
it
contains
some
ten
thousand
inhabitants
amiable
intelligent
and
distinguished
by
a
befitting
the
traditions
of
men
who
sheltered
pythagoras
in
his
hour
of
need
as
at
rossano
catanzaro
and
many
other
calabrian
towns
there
used
to
be
a
ghetto
of
jews
here
the
district
is
still
called
la
giudeca
their
synagogue
was
duly
changed
into
a
church
of
the
madonna
so
much
i
learn
from
montorio
who
further
informs
me
that
the
ubiquitous
saint
peter
preached
here
on
his
way
to
rome
and
converted
the
people
to
christianity
and
that
the
town
can
boast
of
three
authentic
portraits
of
the
mother
of
god
painted
by
saint
luke
lukas
me
pinxit
one
is
rather
bewildered
by
the
number
of
these
masterpieces
in
italy
until
one
realizes
as
an
old
ecclesiastical
writer
has
pointed
out
that
the
saint
being
excellent
in
his
art
could
make
several
of
them
in
a
few
days
to
correspond
to
the
great
devotion
of
those
early
christians
fervent
in
their
love
to
the
great
mother
of
god
whence
we
may
believe
that
to
satisfy
their
ardent
desires
he
was
continually
applying
himself
to
this
task
of
so
much
glory
to
mary
and
her
blessed
son
but
the
sacristan
of
the
church
at
caulonia
to
whom
i
applied
for
information
regarding
these
local
treasures
knew
nothing
about
them
and
his
comments
gave
me
the
impression
that
he
has
relapsed
into
a
somewhat
pagan
way
of
regarding
such
matters
you
may
obtain
a
fairly
good
view
of
caulonia
from
the
southeast
or
again
from
the
neighbouring
hillock
of
san
vito
the
town
lies
some
metres
above
on
a
platform
commanding
the
valleys
of
the
amusa
and
alaro
this
position
which
was
clearly
chosen
for
its
strategic
value
unfortunately
does
not
allow
it
to
expand
and
so
the
inhabitants
are
deprived
of
that
public
garden
which
they
amply
deserve
at
the
highest
point
lies
a
celebrated
old
castle
wherein
according
to
tradition
campanella
was
imprisoned
for
a
while
in
the
days
of
pacicchelli
it
was
a
fine
place
magnifico

mingled
with
the
stones
of
its
old
walls
they
have
recently
found
skeletons
victims
possibly
of
the
same
macabre
superstition
to
which
the
masonry
of
the
tower
of
london
bears
witness
here
too
have
been
unearthed
lamps
and
other
antiquities
what
are
we
to
surmise
from
this
that
it
was
a
roman
foundation
or
that
the
malaria
in
older
times
forced
caulonia
to
wander
towards
healthier
inland
heights
after
the
example
of
and
that
the
romans
continued
to
occupy
this
same
site
or
assuming
castelvetere
to
date
only
from
mediaeval
times
that
these
ancient
relics
found
their
way
into
it
accidentally
the
district
of
foca
at
this
day
is
certainly
very
malarious
whereas
the
up
here
is
only
about

whom
i
am
indebted
for
much
kindness
and
who
is
himself
a
distinguished
worker
in
the
humanitarian
mission
of
combating
malaria
has
published
among
other
interesting
pamphlets
one
which
deals
with
this
village
of
foca
a
small
place
of
about
inhabitants
surrounded
by
fertile
orange
and
vine
plantations
near
the
mouth
of
the
alaro
his
researches
into
its
vital
statistics
for
the
ending
reveal
an
appalling
state
of
affairs
briefly
summarized
they
amount
to
this
that
during
this
period
there
were
births
and
deaths
in
other
words
the
village
which
in
ought
to
have
contained
between
and
inhabitants

only
failed
to
progress
but
devoured
its
original
population
of
and
not
only
them
but
also
fresh
immigrants
who
had
entered
the
region
from
the
healthy
uplands
lured
by
the
hope
of
gaining
a
little
money
during
the
vintage
season
a
veritable
moloch
had
the
old
city
of
caulonia
numbering
perhaps
inhabitants
stood
here
under
such
conditions
of
hygiene
it
would
have
been
expunged
off
the
face
of
the
earth
in
fifty
years
yet
speaking
of
malaria
in
general
a
good
deal
of
evidence
has
been
brought
together
to
show
that
the
disease
has
been
endemic
in
magna
grsecia
for
two
thousand
years
and
the
customs
of
the
sybarites
seem
to
prove
that
they
had
some
acquaintance
with
marsh
fever
and
tried
to
guard
against
it
whoever
would
live
long
so
ran
their
proverb
must
see
neither
the
rising
nor
the
setting
sun
a
queer
piece
of
advice
intelligible
only
if
the
land
was
infested
with
malaria
many
of
their
luxurious
habits
assume
another
import
on
this
hypothesis
like
the
inhabitants
of
the
malarious
etruscan
region
they
were
adepts
at
draining
and
their
river
is
described
in
one
of
the
minor
works
attributed
to
galen
as
rendering
men
infertile
a
characteristic
result
of
malaria
what
is
still
more
significant
is
that
their
new
town
thurii
built
on
the
heights
was
soon
infected
and
though
twice
repeopled
decayed
away
and
that
they
had
chosen
the
heights
for
their
relative
healthfulness
we
can
infer
from
strabo
who
says
that
paestum
a
colony
from
sybaris
was
removed
further
inland
from
the
shore
on
account
of
the
pestilential
climate
of
the
lowlands
but
the
ionian
shores
can
not
have
been
as
deadly
as
they
now
are
we
calculate
for
example
that
the
town
walls
of
croton
measured
eighteen
kilometres
in
circumference
a
figure
which
the
modern
visitor
to
cotrone
only
brings
himself
to
believe
when
he
remembers
what
can
be
actually
proved
of
other
hellenic
colonies
such
as
syracuse
well
the
populace
of
so
large
a
city
requires
a
surrounding
district
to
supply
it
with
agricultural
produce
the
marchesato
the
vast
tract
bordering
on
cotrone
is
now
practically
uninhabitable
the
population
including
the
town
has
sunk
to
to
the
square
kilometre
that
is
malaria
or
rather
only
one
side
of
the
evil
for
these
coastlands
attract
rural
labourers
who
descend
from
the
mountains
during
the
season
of
or
and
then
return
infected
to
their
homes
one
single
malarious
patient
may
inoculate
an
entire
village
hitherto
immune
granted
the
anophelines
are
there
to
propagate
the
mischief
by
means
of
these
annual
migrations
the
scourge
has
spread
in
the
past
and
so
it
spreads
whenever
possible
of
forty
labourers
that
left
caulonia
for
cotrone
in
all
returned
infected
save
two
who
had
made
liberal
use
of
quinine
as
a
prophylactic
fortunately
there
are
no
anophelines
at
caulonia
greatly
indeed
must
this
country
have
changed
since
olden
days
and
gleaning
here
and
there
among
the
ancients
genovese
has
garnered
some
interesting
facts
on
this
head
the
now
unbroken
sand
is
called
in
several
regions
by
strabo
virgil
and
persius
flaccus
of
the
two
harbours
of
locri
of
that
of
metapontum
caulonia
and
other
cities
nothing
remains
the
promontory
of
cocynthum
stilo
described
as
the
longest
promontory
in
italy
together
with
other
capes
has
been
washed
away
by
the
waves
or
submerged
under
silt
carried
down
from
the
hills
islands
like
that
of
calypso
which
is
described
in
vincenzo
pascale
book
and
mentioned
by
castaidi
have
clean
vanished
from
the
map
the
woodlands
have
retired
far
inland
yet
here
at
caulonia
says
thucydides
was
prepared
the
timber
for
the
fleets
of
athens
the
rivers
irregular
and
spasmodic
torrents
must
have
flowed
with
more
equal
and
deeper
current
since
pliny
mentions
five
of
them
as
navigable
snow
very
likely
covered
the
mountain
tops
the
rainfall
was
clearly
more
abundant
one
of
the
sights
of
locri
was
its
daily
rainbow
the
cicadas
of
the
territory
of
reggio
are
said
to
have
been
dumb
on
account
of
the
dampness
of
the
climate
they
are
anything
but
dumb
nowadays
too
have
tilted
the
up
and
down
and
there
is
evidence
to
show
that
while
the
tyrrhenian
shore
has
been
raised
by
these
oscillations
the
ionian
has
sunk
not
long
ago
four
columns
were
found
in
the
sea
at
cotrone
two
hundred
yards
from
the
beach
old
sailors
remember
another
group
of
columns
visible
at
low
tide
near
caulonia
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
ionian
used
to
be
as
rocky
as
the
other
shore
and
this
gradual
sinking
of
the
coast
must
have
retarded
the
rapid
outflow
of
the
rivers
as
it
has
done
in
the
plain
of
paestum
and
in
the
pontine
marshes
favouring
malarious
conditions
earthquakes
have
helped
in
the
work
that
of
lowered
certain
parts
of
the
calabrian
shore
opposite
messina
by
about
one
metre
indeed
though
earthquakes
have
been
known
to
raise
the
soil
and
thereby
improve
it
the
calabrian
ones
have
generally
had
a
contrary
effect
the
terrific
upheavals
of
produced
two
hundred
and
fifteen
lakes
in
the
country
they
were
drained
away
in
a
style
most
creditable
to
the
bourbons
but
there
followed
an
epidemic
of
malaria
which
carried
off
people
these
calabrian
conditions
are
only
part
of
a
general
change
of
climate
which
seems
to
have
taken
place
all
over
italy
a
change
to
which
columella
refers
when
quoting
saserna
he
says
that
formerly
the
vine
and
olive
could
not
prosper
by
reason
of
the
severe
winter
in
certain
places
where
they
have
since
become
abundant
thanks
to
a
milder
temperature
we
never
hear
of
the
frozen
tiber
nowadays
and
many
remarks
of
the
ancients
as
to
the
moist
and
cold
climate
seem
strange
to
us
pliny

the
chestnuts
of
tarentum
i
question
whether
the
tree
could
survive
the
hot
climate
of
nobody
could
induce
splendid
beeches
to
grow
in
the

latium
yet
theophrastus
a
botanist
says
that
they
were
drawn
from
this
region
for
shipbuilding
purposes
this
gradual
desiccation
has
probably
gone
on
for
long
ages
so
signor
cavara
has
discovered
old
trunks
of
white
fir
in
districts
of
the
apennines
where
such
a
plant
could
not
possibly
grow
a
change
to
a
dry
and
warm
atmosphere
is
naturally
propitious
to
malaria
granted
sufficient
water
remains
to
propagate
the
mosquito
and
the
mosquito
contents
itself
with
very

the
merest
teacup
fui
returning
to
old
calabria
we
find
the
woods
of
locri
praised
by

that
must
have
been
of
coniferous

since
virgil

the
aleppo
pine
produces
pitch
and
would
still
flourish
there
as
it
does
in
the
lowlands
between
taranto
and
metaponto
the
classical

however
could
not
grow
at
this
level
any
more
corroborative
evidence
can
be
drawn
from
theocritus
who
mentions
heath

arbutus
as
thriving
in
the
marine
thickets
near

mountain
shrubs
nowadays
that
have
taken

in
cooler

together
with
the

it
is
true
that
he
hints
at
marshes
near
cotrone
and
indeed
large
tracts
of
south
italy
are
described
as
marshy
by
the
ancients
they
may
well
have
harboured
the
anopheles
mosquito
from
time
immemorial
but
it
does
not
follow
that
they
were
malarious
much
of
the
healthy
physical
conditions
may
have
remained
into
the
middle
ages
or
even
later
it
is
strange
to
read
for
example
in
edrisius
of
the

at
rocella

where
the

now
slumber
on
an
even
and
sandy

but
malaria
had
made
insidious
strides
meanwhile
genovese
thinks
that
by
the
year
the
entire
coast
was
malarious
and
abandoned
like
now
though
only
within
the
last
two
centuries
has
man
actively
in
its
dissemination
so
long
as
the
woodlands
on
the
plains
are
cut
down

relatively
little

is
done

it
spells
ruin
to
denude

whoever
wishes
to
know
what

the

with

up
the

devastating
large
tracts
of
fertile
land
it

and
impedes
the

these
ravenous
have
become
a
feature
in

underneath
one
of
the
most
terrible
of
them
lies
the

so
it
comes
about
that
within
recent
times
rivers
have
grown
to
be
the
main
arteries
of
malaria

there
are
rivers
galore
in

so
many
deforestation
and

here
as
in

asia
minor
north
africa
and
other
countries
thus
year
after
year
from
one
cause
or
another
the
conditions
have
become
more
favourable
for
the
disease
to
do
its
fatal
work
that
much
of
this
harm
has
been
done
quite
lately
can
often
be
proved
at
caulonia
for
instance
the
woodlands
are
known
to
have
reached
the
shore
a
hundred
years
ago
and
there
are
bare
tracts
of
land
still
bearing
the
name
of
foresta
in
a
single
summer
a
french
regiment
stationed
at
cosenza
lost
men
from
fever
and
when
rath
visited
the
town
in
it
was
described
to
him
as
a
vast
hospital
during
the
hot
months
nevertheless
says
he
the
disease
has
only
been
so
destructive
during
the
last
two
centuries
for
up
to
that
time
the
forests
touched
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
regulated
the
preventing
the
formation
of
marshes
the
literary
record
of
cosenza
is
one
of
exceptional
brilliance
for
acute
and
original
thought
this
town
can
hardly
be
surpassed
by
any
other
of
its
size
on
earth
were
statistics
available
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
fever
could
be
shown
to
be
largely
responsible
for
the
withering
of
its
spiritual
life
the
same
fate
the
same
relapse
from
prosperity
to
decay
and
for
the
same
reasons
has
overtaken
many
other
riverside
villages
among
them
that
of
tarsia
the
caprasia
of
the
an
tonine
itinerary
it
was
described
to
us
says
rath
as
the
most
miserable
and
dirty
village
in
calabria
but
we
found
it
worse
it
remains
a
highly
infected
and
altogether
pitiable
place
concerning
which
i
have
made
certain
modest
researches
that
would
require
none
the
less
a
chapter
to
themselves
perhaps
i
have
already
said
on
the
subject
an
englishman
unacquainted
with
malaria
might
think
so
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
sir
ronald
ross
has
called
it
perhaps
the
most
important
of
human
diseases
but
let
him
go
to
a
malarious
country
and
see
with
his
own
eyes
something
of
the
degradation
it
involves
how
it
stamps
its
accursed
imprimatur
upon
man
and
nature
alike
it
is
the
blight
of
youth
the
a
italian
senator
has
declared
that
the
story
of
south
italy
is
was
and
will
be
the
story
of
malaria
and
the
greater
part
of
calabria
will
certainly
remain
an
enigma
to
the
traveller
who
ignores
what
is
meant
by
this
plague
malaria
is
the
key
to
a
correct
understanding
of
the
landscape
it
explains
the
inhabitants
their
mode
of
life
their
habits
their
history
xxxv
caulonia
to
serra
how
do
you
treat
your
malaria
patients
i
once
enquired
of
a
doctor
in
india
a
few
good
stiff
doses
he
said
when
the
attack
is
on
that
generally
settles
them
if
not
they
can
begin
again
to
take
quinine
as
a
prophylactic
he
considered
folly
it
might
grow
into
a
habit
you
never
know
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
such
types
are
extinct
out
there
they
are
extinct
hereabouts
none
but
an
ignorant
person
would
now
traverse
malarious
tracts
in
summer
without
previous
or
if
infected
deal
with
the
disease
otherwise
than
by
an
amply
protracted
treatment
of
cure
yet
it
is
only
quite
lately
that
we
have
gained
our
knowledge
of
a
proper
use
of
the
drug
and
this
accounts
for
the
great
mortality
long
after
its
specific
effects
had
been
recognized
by
the
profession
it
was
given
both
inefficiently
and
insufficiently
it
was
sold
at
a
prohibitive
price
the
country
people
were
distrustful
had
taken
it
for
three
or
four
days
he
had
improved
yes
but
the
fever
was
on
him
once
more
why
waste
money
on
such
experiments
i
remember
accosting
a
lad
anemic
shivering
with
the
tertian
and
marked
by
that
untimely
senility
which
is
the
of
malaria
i
suggested
quinine
i
do
take
doctors
stuff
he
said
even
if
i
wanted
to
my
father
would
not
let
me
and
if
he
did
there
no
money
to
pay
for
it
and
if
there
were
it
would
do
no
good
he
tried
it
himself
well
but
how
are
you
feeling
oh
all
right
there
nothing
much
the
matter
with
me
just
the
bad
air
such
types
too
are
practically
extinct
nowadays
the
people
are
being
educated
to
recognize
their
peril
and
how
to
avoid
it
they
begin
to
follow
professor
celli
advice
in
the
matter
of
regarding
quinine
as
their
daily
bread
for
since
the
discovery
of
the
anophelic
origin
of
malaria
many
devices
have
been
put
into
execution
to
combat
the
disease
not
the
least
of
them
being
a
popularized
teaching
of
its
causes
and
consequences
by
means
of
pamphlets
lectures
to
and
so
forth
now
you
may
either
fight
the
anopheles
the
vehicle
or
the
disease
itself
the
first
entails
putting
the
country
into
such
a
state
that
the
mosquito
finds
it
unpleasant
to
live
there
a
labour
of
hercules
yet
large
sums
are
being
expended
in
draining
marshy
tracts
regulating
and
afforesting
bare
spaces
and
if
you
are
interested
in
such
works
you
will
do
well
to
see
what
is
going
on
at
metaponto
at
this
moment
a
considerable
portion
of
the
government
grant
for
these
purposes
has
lately
been
deflected
for
use
in
the
tripolitan
war
exemplary
fines
are
also
imposed
for
illicit
and
grazing
in
those
towns
at
least
where
the
magistrate
has
sufficient
sense
to
perceive
the
ulterior
benefits
to
be
derived
from
what
certainly
entails
a
good
deal
of
temporary
hardship
on
poor
people
certain
economic
changes
are
helping
in
this
work
so
the
wealth
imported
from
america
helps
to
break
up
the
big
properties
those
latifundia
which
says
an
italian
authority
are
synonymous
with
malaria
the
ideal
condition
the
extirpation
of
anophelines
will
never
be
attained
nor
is
it
of
vital
importance
that
it
should
be
far
more
pressing
is
the
protection
of
man
against
their
attacks
wonderful
success
has
crowned
the
of
the
windows
an
outcome
of
the
classical
experiments
of
in
the
roman
campagna
but
chiefest
and
most
urgent
of
all
is
the
cure
of
the
infected
population
in
this
direction
results
astonishing
results
incredible
have
attended
the
recently
introduced
governmental
sale
of
quinine
in
the
year
there
were
deaths
from
malaria
throughout
italy
by
the
number
had
sunk
to
eloquent
figures
that
require
no
comment
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
drug
is
now
sold
at
a
merely
nominal
rate
or
freely
given
away
to
the
needy
nay
thrust
down
the
very
throats
of
the
afflicted
peasantry
by
devoted
gentlemen
who
scour
the
plains
with
ambulances
during
the
deadly
season
despite
this
the
yearly
profits
from
its
sale
are
amounting
to
about
of
a
million
francs
so
these
forlorn
regions
are
at
last
beginning

statistical

in

there
was

here
on

that

here
is
the
place
to
peruse
jones
studies
on

i
will
not

even
the

precis
of
his
conscientious
researches
nor
attempt
to
picture
their
effect
upon
a
mind
trained
in
the
old
school
of
thought
suffice
to
say
that
the
author
would
persuade
us
that
malaria
is
implicated
to
an
hitherto
unsuspected
extent
in
the
decline
of
ancient
greece
and
rome
and
he
succeeds
yes
a
man
accustomed
to
weigh
evidence
will
admit
i
think
that
he
has
made
out
a
suggestively
strong
case
how
puzzled
we
were
to
explain
why
the
brilliant
life
of
magna
graecia
was
snuffed
out
suddenly
like
a
candle
without
any
appreciably
efficient
cause
how
we
listened
to
our
preachers
cackling
about
the
inevitable
consequences
of
sybaritic
luxury
and
to
the
warnings
of
sage
politicians
concerning
the
dangers
of
mere
as
opposed
to
worthier
systems
of
confederation
how
we
drank
it
all
in
and
how
it
warmed
the
cockles
of
our
hearts
to
think
that
we
were
not
vicious
heathens
such
as
these
and
now
a
vulgar
gnat
is
declared
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
mystery
crudely
disconcerting
these
scientific
discoveries
or
is
it
not
rather
hard
to
be
dragged
to
earth
in
this
callous
fashion
while
soaring
heavenward
on
the
wings
of
our
edifying
reflections
for
the
rest
the
old
old
story
a
simple
physical
explanation
of
what
used
to
be
an
enigma
brimful
of
moral
significance
that
jones
facts
and
arguments
will
be
found
applicable
to
other
decayed
races
in
the
old
and
new
worlds
is
highly
probable
meanwhile
it
takes
one
breath
away
quite
sufficiently
to
realize
that
they
apply
to
hellas
and
her
old
colonies
on
these
shores
strange
my
interest
waxes
tell
me
then
what
affliction
god
or
devil
wiped
away
the
fair
life
upon
the
globe
the
beasts
the
birds
the
delectable
plantations
and
all
the
blithe
millions
of
the
human
race
what
calamity
fell
upon
them
a
gnat
a
gnat
even
so
thus
i
wrote
while
yet
unaware
that
such
pests
as
anophelines
existed
upon
earth
at
the
same
time
i
think
we
must
be
cautious
in
following
certain
deductions
of
our
author
that
theory
of
brutality
for
example
as
resulting
from
malaria
speaking
of
calabria
i
would
almost
undertake
to
prove
from
the
archives
of
that
certain
of
the
most
malarial
tracts
are
precisely
those
in
which
there
is
least
brutality
of
any
kind
cotrone
for
instance
the
head
of
the
police
of
that
town
is
so
young
a
mere
boy
that
i
marvelled
how
he
could
possibly
have
obtained
a
position
which
is
usually
filled
by
seasoned
and
experienced
officers
he
was
a
son
of
the
white
hen
they
told
me
that
is
a
socially
favoured
individual
who
was
given
this
job
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
was
hardly
any
serious
work
for
him
to
do
cosenza
on
the
other
hand
has
a
very
different
reputation
nowadays
and
it
is
perfectly
easy
to
explain
how
malaria
might
have
contributed
to
this
end
for
the
disease
and
herein
lies
its
curse
lowers
both
the
physical
and
social
standard
of
a
people
it
breeds
misery
poverty
and
ignorance
fit
soil
for
callous
rapacity
but
how
about
his
theory
of
pessimism
infecting
the
outlook
of
generations
of
sages
i
find
no
trace
of
pessimism
here
not
even
in
its
mild
buddhistic
form
the
most
salient
mental
trait
of
cultured
calabrians
is
a
subtle
detachment
and
contempt
of
illusions
whence
their
renown
as
abstract
thinkers
and
speculators
this
derives
from
a
philosophic
view
of
life
and
entails
naturally
enough
the
outward
semblance
of
gravity
a
spanish
gravity
due
not
so
much
to
a
strong
graft
of
spanish
blood
and
customs
during
the
viceregal
period
as
to
actual
affinities
with
the
race
of
spain
but
this
gravity
has
nothing
in
common
with
pessimism
antagonistic
though
it
be
to
those
outbursts
of
irresponsible
optimism
engendered
under
northern
skies
by
copious
food
or
beer
to
reach
the
uplands
of
fabbrizia
and
serra
whither
i
was
now
bound
i
might
have
utilized
the
driving
road
from
gioioso
on
the
reggio
side
of
caulonia
but
that
was
everybody
route
or
i
might
have
gone
stilo
on
the
other
side
but
stilo
with
its
memories
of
campanella
a
spanish
type
this
and
of
otho
ii
its
winding
track
into
the
heights
of
ferdinandea
was
already
familiar
to
me
i
elected
to
penetrate
straight
inland
by
the
shortest
way
a
capable
muleteer
at
once
presented
himself
we
passed
through
one
single
village
ragona
leaving
those
of
nicola
and
nardo
di
pace
on
the
right
the
first
of
them
is
celebrated
for
its
annual
miracle
of
the
burning
olive
when
armed
to
the
teeth
for
some
ancient
reason
the
populace
repairs
to
the
walls
of
a
certain
convent
out
of
which
there
grows
an
olive
tree
at
its
foot
is
kindled
a
fire
whose
flames
are
sufficient
to
scorch
all
the
leaves
but
behold
next
day
the
foliage
is
seen
to
glow
more
bravely
green
than
ever
perhaps
the
roots
of
the
tree
are
near
some
cistern
these
mountain
villages
hidden
under
oaks
and
vines
with
waters
trickling
through
their
lanes
a
fine
climate
and
a
soil
that
bears
everything
needful
for
life
must
be
ideal
habitations
for
simple
folks
in
some
of
them
the
is
as
low
as
malaria
is
unknown
here
they
seem
to
fulfil
all
the
conditions
of
a
terrestrial
paradise
there
is
a
note
of
joyous
vigour
in
this
landscape
the
winds
in
and
out
among
the
heights
through
flowery
meadows
grazed
by
cattle
and
full
of
buzzing
insects
and
butterflies
and
along
cunningly
irrigated
it
climbs
up
to
heathery
summits
and
down
again
through
glades
of
chestnut
and
ilex
with
mossy
trunks
whose
shadow
fosters
strange
sensations
of
chill
and
gloom
then
out
again
into
the
sunshine
of
waving
corn
and
poppies
for
a
short
while
we
stumbled
along
a
and
i
grew
rather
sad
to
think
that
it
might
be
the
last
i
should
see
for
some
time
to
come
my
days
in
this
country
being
now
numbered
this
one
was
narrow
but
there
are
others
interminable
in
length
and
breadth
interminable
no
breeze
stirs
in
those
deep
depressions
through
which
the
merest
thread
of
milky
water
trickles
disconsolately
the
sun
blazes
overhead
and
hours
pass
while
you
trudge
through
the
fiery
inferno
scintillations
of
heat
rise
from
the
stones
and
still
you
crawl
onwards
breathless
and
footsore
till
eyes
are
dazed
and
senses
reel
one
may
well
say
bad
things
of
these
torrid
deserts
of
pebbles
which
up
till
lately
were
the
only
highways
from
the
lowlands
into
the
mountainous
parts
but
they
are
sweet
in
memory
one
calls
to
mind
the
wild
savours
that
hang
in
the
stagnant
air
the
cloven
seamed
with
gorgeous
patches
of
russet
and
purple
and
green
the
spectral
tamarisks
and
the
glory
of
oleanders
rising
in
solitary
tufts
of
beauty
or
flaming
congregations
out
of
the
pallid
waste
of
boulders
after
exactly
six
hours
fabbrizia
was
reached
a
large
place
whose
name
like
that
of
borgia
savelli
carafa
and
other
villages
on
these
southern
hills
calls
up
associations
utterly
fabbrizia
with
pretentious
new
church
and
fantastically
dirty
it
lies
at
the
respectable
elevation
of
metres
on
the
summit
of
a
monstrous
landslide
which
has
disfigured
the
country
while
ascending
along
the
flank
of
this
deformity
i
was
able
to
see
how
the
authorities
have
attempted
to
cope
with
the
mischief
and
arrest
further
collapses
this
is
what
they
have
done
the
minute
channels
of
water
that
might
contribute
to
the
disintegration
of
the
soil
by
running
into
this
gaping
wound
from
the
sides
or
above
have
been
artfully
diverted
from
their
natural
courses
trees
and
shrubs
are
planted
at
its
outskirts
in
order
to
uphold
the
earth
at
these
spots
by
their
roots
they
have
been
protected
by
barbed
wire
from
the
grazing
of
cattle
furthermore
a
multitude
of
wickerwork
dykes
are
thrown
across
the
accessible
portions
of
the
scar
to
collect
the
material
and
tempt
winged
to
establish
themselves
on
the
ledges
thus
formed
to
bridle
this
runaway
mountain
is
no
mean
task
for
such

like
rodent
ulcers
ever
enlarging
at
the
edges
with
the
heat
with
every
shower
of
rain
with
every
breath
of
wind
the
earth
crumbles
away
there
is
an
eternal
trickling
day
and
night
until
some
huge
boulder
is
exposed
which
crashes
down
loosening
everything
in
its
wild
career
a
single
tempest
may
disrupture
what
the
patience
and
ingenuity
of
years
have
contrived
three
more
hours
or
thereabouts
will
take
you
to
serra
san
bruno
along
the
backbone
of
southern
italy
through
cultivated
lands
and
pasture
and
lonely
stretches
of
bracken
once
covered
by
woodlands
it
may
well
be
that
the
townlet
has
grown
up
around
or
rather
near
the
carthusian
monastery
i
know
nothing
of
its
history
save
that
it
has
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
most
bigoted
places
in
calabria
a
fact
of
which
the
sagacious
general
manhes
availed
himself
when
he
devised
his
original
and
effective
plan
of
chastising
the
inhabitants
for
a
piece
of
atrocious
conduct
on
their
part
he
caused
all
the
local
priests
to
be
arrested
and
imprisoned
the
churches
were
closed
and
the
town
placed
under
what
might
be
called
an
interdict
the
natives
took
it
quietly
at
first
but
soon
the
terror
of
the
situation
dawned
upon
them
no
religious
marriages
no
baptisms
no
funerals
the
comforts
of
heaven
refused
to
living
and
dead
alike
the
strain
grew
intolerable
and
in
a
panic
of
remorse
the
populace
hunted
down
their
own
and
handed
them
over
to
manhes
who
duly
executed
them
one
and
all
then
the
interdict
was
taken
off
and
the
priests
set
at
liberty
and
a
certain
writer
tells
us
that
the
people
were
so
charmed
with
the
general
humane
and
businesslike
methods
that
they
forthwith
christened
him
saint
manhes
a
name
which
he
avers
has
clung
to
him
ever
since
the
monastery
lies
about
a
mile
distant
near
at
hand
is
a
little
artificial
lake
and
the
renowned
chapel
of
santa
maria
there
was
a
time
when
i
would
have
dilated
lovingly
upon
this
structure
a
time
when
i
probably
knew
as
much
about
carthusian
convents
as
is
needful
for
any
of
their
inmates
when
i
studied
tromby
ponderous
work
and
god
knows
how
many
more
ay
and
spent
two
precious
weeks
of
my
life
in
deciphering
certain
crabbed
mss
of
tutini
in
the
brancacciana
library
ay
and
tested
the
spleenful
perrey
ragioni
del
regio
fisco
as
to
the
alleged
propensities
of
this
order
ay
and
even
pilgrimaged
to
rome
to
consult
the
present
general
of
the
carthusians
his
predecessor
more
likely
as
to
some
administrative
detail
which
has
wholly
escaped
my
memory
gone
are
those
days
of
studious
gropings
into
blind
alleys
the
current
of
zeal
has
slowed
down
or
turned
aside
maybe
into
other
channels
they
who
wish
will
find
a
description
of
the
pristine
splendour
of
this
monastery
in
various
books
by
pacicchelli
the
catastrophe
of
was
described
by
keppel
craven
and
reported
upon
with
illustrations
by
the
commission
of
the
naples
academy
and
if
you
are
of
a
romantic
turn
of
mind
you
will
find
a
good
story
of
the
place
as
it
looked
duringthe
ruinous
days

desolation
in
misasi
calabrian
tales
it
is
now
rebuilt
on
modern
lines
and
not
much
of
the
original
structure
remains
upright
i
wandered
about
the
precincts
in
the
company
of
two
french
monks
endeavouring
to
reconstruct
not
the
convent
as
it
was
in
its
younger
days
but
that
older

never

me

again

it
seemed
to
me
that

dwelt

gissing
haunts
these
chambers
and
passages
it
was
in
that
he
lodged
here
with
that
worthy
trio
gibbon
lenormant
and
cassiodorus
the
chapters
devoted
to
cotrone
are
the
most
lively
and
characteristic
in
his
ionian
sea
strangely
does
the
description
of
his
arrival
in
the
town
and
his
reception
in
the
concordia
resemble
that
in
bourget
sensations
the
establishment
has
vastly
improved
since
those
days
the
food
is
good
and
varied
the
charges
moderate
the
place
is
spotlessly
clean
in
every
part
i
could
only
wish
that
the
hotels
in
some
of
our
english
country
towns
were
up
to
the
standard
of
the
concordia
in
this
respect
one
can
not
live
without
cleanliness
as
the
housemaid
assiduously
scrubbing
remarked
to
me
it
is
also
enlarged
the
old
whose
guests
are
so
humorously
described
by
him
is
now
my
favourite
bedroom
while
those
wretched
sputtering
on
the
wall
have
been
replaced
by
a
lavish
use
of
electricity
one
is
hardly
safe
however
in
praising
these
inns
they
are
so
apt
to
change
hands
so
long
as
competition
with
the
two
others
continues
the
concordia
will
presumably
keep
to
its
present
level
of
freaks
in
the
i
have
so
far
only
observed
one
whom
gissing
might
have
added
to
his
collection
he
is
a
of
some
kind
and
his
method
of
devouring
maccheroni
i
unreservedly
admire
it
displays
that
lack
of
all
effort
which
distinguishes
true
art
from
false
he
does
not
eat
them
with
deliberate
mastication
he
does
not
even
like
your
ordinary
amateur
drink
them
in
separate
gulps
but
he
contrives
by
some
process
of
levitation
that
the
whole
plateful
shall
rise
in
a
noiseless
and
unbroken
flood
from
the
table
to
his
mouth
whence
it
glides
down
his
gullet
with
the
relentless
ease
of
a
river
pouring
into
a
cavern
altogether
a
series
of
films
depicting
him
at
work
upon
a
meal
would
make
the
fortune
of
a
company
in
england
not
here
however
such
types
are
too
common
to
be
remarked
the
reason
being
that
boys
are
seldom
sent
to
boarding
schools
where
stereotyped
conventions
of
good
form
are
held
up
for
their
imitation
but
brought
up
at
home
by
adoring
mothers
who
care
little
for
such
externals
or
if
they
do
have
no
great
authority
to
enforce
their
views
on
entering
the
world
these
eccentricities
in
manner
are
proudly
clung
to
as
a
sign
of
manly
independence
death
has
made
hideous
gaps
in
the
short
interval
the
kindly
at
catanzaro
is
no
more
the
mayor
of
cotrone
whose
permit
enabled
gissing
to
visit
that
orchard
by
the
riverside
has
likewise
joined
the
majority
the
housemaid
of
the
concordia
the
domestic
serf
with
dark
and
fiercely
flashing
eyes
dead
and
dead
is
mine
hostess
the
stout
slatternly
sleepy
woman
who
seemed
surprised
at
my
demand
for
food
but
at
length
complied
with
it
but
the
little
waiter
is
alive
and
now
married
and
doctor
sculco
still
resides
in
his
aristocratic
up
that
winding
way
in
the
old
town
with
the
escutcheon
of
a
scorpion
portentous
emblem
for
a
doctor
over
its
entrance
he
is
a
little
greyer
no
doubt
but
the
same
genial
and
alert
personage
as
in
those
days
i
called
on
this
gentleman
hoping
to
obtain
from
him
some
reminiscences
of
gissing
whom
he
attended
during
a
serious
illness
yes
he
replied
to
my
enquiries
i
remember
him
quite
well
the
young
english
poet
who
was
ill
here
i
prescribed
for
him
yes
yes
he
wore
his
hair
long
and
that
was
all
i
could
draw
from
him
i
have
noticed
more
than
once
that
italian
physicians
have
a
stern
conception
of
the
hippocratic
oath
the
affairs
of
their
patients
dead
or
alive
are
a
sacred
trust
in
perpetuity
the
town
furthermore
has
undergone
manifold
improvements
in
those
few
years
trees
are
being
planted
by
the
roadsides
electric
light
is
everywhere
and
best
of
all
an
excellent
has
been
led
down
from
the
cool
heights
of
the
sila
bringing
cleanliness
health
and
prosperity
in
its
train
and
a
stately
is
being
built
over
the
esaro
that
all
but
stagnant
and
wholly
pestilential
stream
the
esaro
pleasantly
says
the
chronicler
noia
molisi
perhaps
it
really
glided
in
his
day
one
might
do
worse
than
spend
a
quiet
month
or
two
at
cotrone
in
the
spring
for
the
place
grows
upon
one
it
is
so
reposeful
and
orderly
but
not
in
winter
gissing
committed
the
common
error
of
visiting
south
italy
at
that
season
when
even
if
the
weather
will
pass
the
country
and
its
inhabitants
are
not
true
to
themselves
you
must
not
come
to
these
parts
in
winter
time
nor
yet
in
the
autumn
for
the
surrounding
district
is
highly
malarious
thucydides
already
speaks
of
these
coastlands
as
depopulated
relatively
speaking
i
suppose
and
under
the
romans
they
recovered
but
little
they
have
only
begun
to
revive
quite
lately
footnote
between
and
in
this
single
province
of
catanzaro
there
was
an
actual
decline
in
the
population
of
towns
and
villages
malaria
yet
this
town
must
have
looked
well
enough
in
the
twelfth
century
since
it
is
described
by
edrisius
as
a
very
old
city
primitive
and
beautiful
prosperous
and
populated
in
a
smiling
position
with
walls
of
defence
and
an
ample
port
for
anchorage
i
suspect
that
the
history
of
cotrone
will
be
found
to
bear
out
professor
celli
theory
of
the
periodical
recrudescences
and
abatements
of
malaria
however
that
may
be
the
place
used
to
be
in
a
deplorable
state
riedesel
calls
it

plus
affreuse
de

twenty

later

in

vespoli
it
contained

souls
i
rejoice
to
cite
such
figures
they
show
how
vastly
cotrone
together
with
the
rest
of
calabria
has
improved
since
the
bourbons
were
ousted
the
sack
of
the
town
by
their
hero
cardinal
ruffo
described
by
pepe
and
others
must
have
left
long
traces
horrible
was
the
carnage
perpetrated
by
these
ferocious
bands
neither
age
nor
sex
nor
condition
was
spared
after
two
days
of
pillage
accompanied
by
a
multitude
of
excesses
and
cruelties
they
erected
on
the
third
day
a
magnificent
altar
in
the
middle
of
a
large
square
and
here
the
cardinal
clothed
in
his
sacred
purple
praised
the
good
deeds
of
the
past
two
days
and
then
raising
his
arms
displayed
a
crucifix
absolving
his
crew
from
the
faults
committed
during
the
ardour
of
the
sack
and
blessed
them
i
shall
be
sorry
to
leave
these
regions
for
the
north
as
leave
them
i
must
in
shortest
time
the
bathing
alone
would
tempt
me
to
prolong
my
stay
were
it
possible
whereas
taranto
despite
its
situation
possesses
no
convenient
beach
there
are
here
on
either
side
of
the
town
leagues
of
shimmering
sand
lapped
by
tepid
and
caressing
waves
it
is
a
sunlit
solitude
the
land
is
your
own
the
sea
your
own
as
far
as
eye
can
reach
one
may
well
become
an
amphibian
at
cotrone
the
inhabitants
of
this
town
are
and
devoid
of
the
ineffable
air
of
the
tarentines
but
they
are
not
a
handsome
race
gissing
says
a
propos
of
the
products
of
a
local
photographer
that
it
was
a
hideous
exhibition
some
of
the
visages
attained
an
incredible
degree
of
vulgar
ugliness
that
is
quite
true
old
authors
praise
the
beauty
of
the
women
of
cotrone
bagnara
and
other
southern
towns
for
my
part
i
have
seldom
found
women
in
the
coastlands
of
calabria
the
matrons
especially
seem
to
favour
that
ideal
of
the
hottentot
venus
which
you
may
study
in
the
jardin
des
plantes
they
are
decidedly
centripetal
of
the
girls
and
boys
one
notices
only
those
who
possess
a
peculiar
trait
the
eyebrows
pencilled
in
a
dead
straight
line
which
gives
them
an
almost
hieratic
aspect
i
can
not
guess
from
what
race
is
derived
this
marked
feature
which
fades
away
with
age
as
the
brows
wax
thicker
and
irregular
in
contour
we
may
call
it
hellenic
on
the
principle
that
everything
attractive
comes
from
the
greeks
while
its
opposite
is
ascribed
to
those
unfortunate
arabs
who
as
a
matter
of
fact
are
a
sufficiently
breed
and
there
must
be
very
little
greek
blood
left
here
the
town
among
many
similar
vicissitudes
was
peopled
largely
by
bruttians
after
hannibal
had
established
himself
here
in
the
viceregal
period
again
there
was
a
great
infusion
of
spanish
elements
a
number
of
spanish
surnames
still
linger
on
the
spot
and
what
of
gissing
other
friend
the
amiable
guardian
of
the
cemetery
his
simple
good
nature
and
intelligence
greatly
won
upon
me
i
like
to
think
of
him
as
still
quietly
happy
amid
his
garden
walls
tending
flowers
that
grow
over
the
dead
at
cotrone
dead
like
those
whose
graves
he
tended
like
gissing
himself
he
expired
in
february
the
year
of
the
publication
of
the
ionian
sea
and
they
showed
me
his
tomb
near
the
right
side
of
the
entrance
poor
little
grave
with
a
wooden
cross
bearing
a
number
which
will
soon
be
removed
to
make
room
for
another
one
this
cemetery
by
the
sea
is
a
fair
green
spot
enclosed
in
a
high
wall
and
set
with
flowering
plants
and
comely
cypresses
that
look
well
against
their
background
of
barren
wandering
here
i
called
to
mind
the
decent
cemetery
of
lucera
and
that
of
manfredonia
built
in
a
sleepy
hollow
at
the
back
of
the
town
which
the
monks
in
olden
days
had
utilized
as
their
kitchen
garden
it
is
one
of
the
few
localities
where
deep
soil
can
be
found
on
that
thirsty
limestone
plain
i
remembered
the
venosa
near
the
site
of
the
roman
amphitheatre
among
the
tombs
of
which
i
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
find
proofs
that
the
name
of
horace
is
as
common
here
as
that
of
manfred
in
those
other
two
towns
the
taranto
cemetery
beyond
the
railway
quarter
somewhat
overloaded
with
pretentious
ornaments
i
thought
of
many
cities
of
the
dead
in
places
recently
explored
that
of
rossano
within
but
splendidly
situated
on
a
projecting
spur
that
dominates
the
ionian
of
caulonia
secluded
among
ravines
at
the
back
of
the
town
they
are
all
full
of
character
a
note
in
the
landscape
with
their
cypresses
darkly
towering
amid
the
pale
and
lowly
olives
one
would
think
the
populace
had
thrown
its
whole
poetic
feeling
into
the
choice
of
these
sites
and
their
embellishments
but
this
is
not
the
case
they
are
chosen
merely
for
convenience
not
too
far
from
habitations
and
yet
on
ground
that
is
comparatively
cheap
nor
are
they
truly
venerable
like
ours
they
date
for
the
most
part
from
the
timewhen
the
government
abolished
the
oldsystem
of
inhumation
in
churches
a
system
which
for
the
rest
still
survives
there
are
over
six
hundred
of
these
in
use
at
this
moment
most
of
them
in
churches
and
a
sad
thought
obtrudes
itself
in
these
oases
of
peace
and
verdure
the
italian
law
requires
that
the
body
shall
be
buried
within
hours
after
decease
the
french
consider
hours
too
short
a
term
and
are
thinking
of
modifying
their
regulations
in
this
respect
a
doctor
certificate
of
death
is
necessary
but
often
impossible
to
procure
since
some
five
hundred
italian
communities
possess
no
medical
man
whatever
add
to
this
the
superstitions
of
ignorant
country
people
towards
the
dead
testified
to
by
extraordinary
beliefs
and
customs
which
you
will
find
in
pitré
and
other
collectors
of
native
lore
their
mingled
fear
and
hatred
of
a
corpse
which
prompts
them
to
thrust
it
underground
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
premature
burial
must
be
all
too
frequent
here
i
will
not
enlarge
upon
the
theme
of
horror
by
relating
what
gravediggers
have
seen
with
their
own
eyes
on
disturbing
old
coffins
if
only
half
what
they
tell
me
is
true
it
reveals
a
state
of
affairs
not
to
be
contemplated
without
shuddering
pity
and
one
that
calls
for
prompt
legislation
only
last
year
a
frightful
case
came
to
light
in
sicily
here
at
the
cemetery
the
driving
road
abruptly
ends
thenceforward
there
is
merely
a
track
along
the
sea
that
leads
ultimately
to
capo
nau
where
stands
a
solitary
column
last
relic
of
the
great
temple
of
hera
i
sometimes
follow
it
as
far
as
certain
wells
that
are
sunk
into
the
sand
and
dedicated
to
saint
anne
goats
and
cows
recline
here
after
their
meagre
repast
of
scorched
grasses
and
the
shepherds
in
charge
have
voices
so
soft
and
manners
so
gentle
as
to
call
up
suggestions
of
the
golden
age
these
pastoral
folk
are
the
primitives
of
cotrone
from
father
to
son
for
untold
ages
before
theocritus
hymned
them
they
have
kept
up
their
peculiar
habits
and
traditions
between
them
and
the
agricultural
classes
is
a
gulf
as
deep
as
between
these
and
the
citizens
conversing
with
them
one
marvels
how
the
same
occupation
can
produce
creatures
so
unlike
as
these
and
the
of
naples
the
most
desperate
the
cows
may
well
be
descendants
of
the
sacred
cattle
of
hera
that
browsed
under
the
pines
which
are
known
to
have
clothed
the
bleak
promontory
you
may
encounter
them
every
day
wandering
on
the
way
to
the
town
which
they
supply
with
milk
to
avoid
the
dusty
road
they
march
sedately
through
the
soft
wet
sand
at
the
water
edge
their
silvery
bodies
outlined
against
a
cserulean
flood
of
sky
and
sea
on
this
promenade
i
yesterday
observed
beside
the
waves
a
meditative
priest
who
gave
me
some
details
regarding
the
ruined
church
of
which
gissing
speaks
it
lies
in
the
direction
of
the
cemetery
outside
the
town
its
lonely
position
he
says
made
it
interesting
and
the
cupola
of
coloured
tiles
like
that
of
the
cathedral
of
amalfi
remained
intact
a
bright
spot
against
the
grey
hills
behind
this
cupola
has
recently
been
removed
but
part
of
the
old
walls
serve
as
foundation
for
a
new
sanctuary
a
structure
with
roof
i
am
glad
to
have
taken
a
view
of
it
some
years
ago
ere
its
transformation
its
patroness
is
the
madonna
del
carmine
the
same
whose
church
in
naples
is
frequented
by
thieves
and
who
make
a
special
cult
of
this
virgin
motherand
invoke
her
blessing
on
their
nefarious
undertakings
the
old
church
he
told
me
was
built
in
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
this
new
one
he
agreed
might
have
been
constructed
on
more
ambitious
lines
but
nowadays
and
he
broke
off
with
eloquent
aposiopesis
it
was
the
same
he
went
on
with
the
road
to
the
cemetery
why
should
it
not
be
continued
right
up
to
the
cape
of
the
column
as
in
olden
days
over
ground
ogni
passo
è
una
memoria
where
every
footstep
is
a
memory
rich
italians
he
said
sometimes
give
away
money
to
benefit
the
public
but
the
very
rich
never
and
at
cotrone
you
must
remember
every
one
belongs
to
the
latter
class
we
spoke
of
the
sila
which
he
had
occasionally
visited
what
he
asked
incredulously
you
have
crossed
the
whole
of
that
country
where
there
is
nothing
to
eat
nothing
in
the
purest
and
most
literal
sense
of
that
word
my
dear
sir
you
must
feel
like
hannibal
after
his
passage
of
the
alps
those
barren
on
our
right
of
which
gissing
speaks
they
are
like
the
of
the
apennines
annoyed
him
considerably
they
were
the
malediction
of
the
town
he
declared
at
the
same
time
they
supplied
him
with
the
groundwork
of
a
theory
for
which
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
the
old
greek
city
he
conjectured
must
have
been
largely
built
of
bricks
made
from
their
clay
which
is
once
more
being
utilized
for
this
purpose
how
else
account
for
its
utter
disappearance
much
of
the
finer
buildings
were
doubtless
of

and
these
have
been
worked
into
the
fort
the
harbour

of

this

never
account
for
the
vanishing
of
a
town
nearly
twelve
miles
in

bricks

explain
the
mystery
they
had
crumbled
into

ere
yet
the

rebuilt

the
city
on
the
promontory
now
occupied
by
the
new
settlement
the
modern
palaces
on
the
rising
ground
of
the
citadel
are
worthy
of
a
visit
they
are
inhabited
by
some
millionaires
who
have
given
cotrone
the
reputation
of
being
the
richest
town
of
its
size
in
italy
so
far
as
i
can
judge
the
histories
of
some
of
these
wealthy
families
would
be
curious
reading
gentlemen
said
the
shepherd
if
you
have
designs
of
trading
you
must
go
another
way
but
if
you
of
the
admired
sort
of
men
that
have
the
thriving
qualifications
of
lying
and
cheating
you
in
the
direct

in

no
learning

eloquence
finds
no
room
here
nor
can
temperance
good

or
any

meet
with
a
reward
assure
yourselves
of
finding
but
two
sorts
of
men
and
those
are
the
cheated
and
those
that
cheat
if
gossip
at
naples
and

is
to
be

old
petronius
seems
to
have
had
a
prophetic
glimpse
of
the
du
of
modern
cotrone
xxxvii
cotrone
the
sun
has
entered
the
lion
but
the
temperature
at
cotrone
is
not
excessive
five
degrees
lower
than
taranto
or
milan
or
london
one
grows
weary
none
the
less
of
the
deluge
of
implacable
light
that
descends
day
after
day
from
the
aether
the
glistering
streets
are
all
but
deserted
after
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
a
few
busy
folks
move
about
till
midday
on
the
pavements
and
so
do
i
in
the
water
but
the
long
hours
following
luncheon
are
consecrated
to
meditation
and
repose
a
bundle
of
italian
newspapers
has
preceded
me
hither
upon
these
i
browse
dispersedly
while
awaiting
the
soft
call
to
slumber
here
are
some
provincial
sheets
the
movement
of
the
new
rossano
the
bruttian
of
corigliano
with
strong
literary
flavour
astonishing
how
decentralized
italy
still
is
how
brimful
of
purely
local
patriotism
what
conception
have
these
men
of
rome
as
their
capital
these
articles
often
reflect
a
lively
turmoil
of
ideas
who
pays
for
such
journalistic
ventures
typography
is
cheap
and
contributors
naturally
content
themselves
with
the
ample
remuneration
of
appearing
in
print
before
their
a
considerable
number
of
copies
are
exported
to
america
yet
i
question
whether
the
circulation
of
the
new
rossano
a
fortnightly
in
its
sixth
year
can
exceed
five
hundred
copies
but
these
venial
and
vapid
neapolitan
dailies
are
my
pet
aversion
we
know
them
autres
with
their
odious
personalities
and
playful
blackmailing
tactics
many
distinguished
foreigners
myself
included
could
tell
a
tale
anent
that
subject
instead
of
descending
to
such
matters
let
me
copy
it
is
too
good
to
translate
a
thrilling
item
of
news
from
the
chiefest
of
them
the
which
touches
furthermore
upon
the
subject
of
calabrian
progress

le
continuate

di

siamo
sicuri
che
uffizio
postale
di

assurgerà
fra
non
molto
ad
importanza
maggiore
di
quella
che
attualmente
the
erection
of
a
in
the
street
of
a
small
place
of
which
per
cent
of
the
readers
have
never
so
much
as
heard
i
begin
to
understand
why
the
cultured
tarentines
do
not
read
these
journals
by
far
the
best
part
of
all
such
papers
is
the
personal
column
wherein
lovers
communicate
with
each
other
or
endeavour
to
do
so
i
read
it
conscientiously
from
beginning
to
end
admiring
in
my
physical
capacity
the
throbbing
passion
that
prompts
such
public
outbursts
of
confidence
and
from
a
literary
point
of
view
their
lapidary
style
model
of
condensation
impossible
to
render
in
english
and
conditioned
by
the
hard
fact
that
every
word
costs
two
sous
under
this
painful
material
stress
indeed
the
messages
are
sometimes
crushed
into
a
conciseness
which
the
females
concerned
must
have
some
difficulty
in
unperplexing
what
on
earth
does
the
parsimonious
mean
by
his
delphic
fourpenny
worth
thus
punctuated
you
have
not
received
how
safety
one
can
not
help
smiling
at
this
circuitous
and
unromantic
method
of
touching
the
hearts
of
ladies
who
take
one
fancy
at
the
same
time
it
testifies
to
a
resourceful
vitality
striving
to
break
through
the
barriers
of
convention
which
surround
the
fair
sex
in
this
country
they
are
nothing
if
not
poetic
these
swains
murmurs
my
soul
lies
on
your
pillow
caressing
you
softly
laments
that
as
bird
outside
nest
i
am
alone
and
lost
what
sadness
and
finds
the
days
eternal
till
thursday
and
yet
they
often
choose
rather
prosaic
pseudonyms
here
is
who
suffers
from
your
silence
while
is
anticipating
one
endless
kiss
and
observing
more
ir
sorrow
than
in
anger
that
he
waited
vainly
one
whole
hour
but
the
sagacious
desires
before
commiting
himself
further
a
personal
interview
he
has
perhaps
been
cooked
once
before
letters
and
numbers
are
best
after
all
so
thinks
who
is
utterly
disgusted
with
his
flame
your
silence
speaks
useless
saying
anything
ca
ira
and
likewise
b
a
designing
rogue
and
plainly
a
spendthrift
who
wastes
ninepence
in
making
it
clear
that
he
wishes
to
marry
rich
young
lady
forgiving
youthful
errors
if
i
were
the
girl
i
would
prefer
to
take
my
chances
with
cooked
lobster
will
indicate
method
possible
how
many
of
these
arrows
i
wonder
reach
their
mark
ah
here
are
politics
and
news
of
the
world
at
last
a
promising
article
on
the
direttissimo
the
railway
line
that
is
to
connect
the
two
towns
by
way
of
the
pontine
marshes
dear
me
this
reads
very
familiarly
why
to
be
sure
it
is
the
identical
dissertation
with
a
few
changes
by
the
that
has
cropped
up
periodically
in
these
pages
for
the
last
or
whenever
the
railway
was
first
projected
the
line
as
usual
is
being
projected
more
strenuously
than
before
and
certain
members
of
the
government
have
goneso
far
as
to
declare
h
let
me
try
something
else
the
feminist
movement
in
england
by
our
london
correspondent
who
lives
in
a
little
side
street
off
the
toledo
that
sounds
stimulating
the
advanced
english
feminists
so
it
runs
are
taking
the
lead
in
encouraging
their
torpid
sisters
on
the
continent
hardly
a
day
passes
that
some
new
manifestation
of
the
feminist
movement
in
fact
it
may
be
avowed
that
the
feminist
movement
in
england
the
air
is
cooler
as
i
awake
and
looking
out
of
the
window
i
perceive
from
the
mellow
that
day
is
declining
towards
this
sunset
hour
the
unbroken
dome
of
the
sky
often
undergoes
a
brief
transformation
masses
of
cloud
may
then
be
seen
accumulating
over
the
sila
heights
and
gathering
auxiliaries
from
every
quarter
lightning
is
soon
playing
about
the
livid
and
murky
vapours
you
can
hear
the
thunders
muttering
up
yonder
to
some
drenching
downpour
but
on
the
plain
the
sun
continues
to
shine
in
vacuously
benevolent
fashion
nothing
is
felt
of
the
tempest
save
unquiet
breaths
of
wind
that
raise
from
the
country
roads
and
lash
the
sea
into
a
mock
frenzy
of
crisp
little
waves
it
is
the
merest
interlude
soon
the
drifts
have
fled
away
from
the
mountains
that
stand
out
clear
and
refreshed
in
the
twilight
the
wind
has
died
down
the
storm
is
over
and
cotrone
thirsts
as
ever
for
rain
that
never
comes
yet
they
have
a
here
a
celebrated
madonna
painted
by
saint
luke
who
always
procures
rain
when
prayed
to
once
indeed
the
tail
of
a
shower
must
have
passed
overhead
for
there
fell
a
few
sad
drops
i
hurried
abroad
together
with
some
other
citizens
to
observe
the
phenomenon
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
matter
it
was
genuine
rain
the
drops
lay
at
respectable
intervals
on
the
white
dust
of
the
station
turnpike
a
boy
who
happened
to
be
passing
in
a
cart
remarked
that
if
the
shower
could
have
been
collected
into
a
saucer
or
some
other
small
receptacle
it
might
have
sufficed
to
quench
the
thirst
of
a
i
usually
take
a
final
dip
in
the
sea
at
this
time
of
the
evening
after
that
it
is
advisable
to
absorb
an
ice
or
two
they
are
excellent
at
cotrone
and
a
glass
of
strega
liqueur
to
ward
off
the
effects
of
next
a
brief
promenade
through
the
clean
streets
and
now
populous
streets
or
along
the
boulevard
margherita
to
view
the
rank
and
fashion
taking
the
air
by
the
murmuring
waves
under
the
battlements
of
charles
the
fifth
castle
and
so
to
dinner
this
meal
marks
the
termination
of
my
daily
tasks
nothing
serious
is
allowed
to
engage
my
attention
once
that
repast
is
ended
i
call
for
a
chair
and
sit
down
at
one
of
the
small
tables
in
the
open
street
and
watch
the
crowd
as
it
floats
around
me
smoking
a
neapolitan
cigar
and
imbibing
alternately
ices
and
black
coffee
until
towards
midnight
a
final
bottle
of
di
is
uncorked
fit
seal
for
the
labours
of
the
day
one
might
say
much
in
praise
of
calabrian
wine
the
land
is
full
of
pleasant
surprises
for
the
cenophilist
and
one
of
these
days
i
hope
to
embody
my
experiences
in
the
publication
of
a
of
the
province
with
descriptive
text
running
alongside
the
purchasers
of
which
if
few
will
certainly
be
of
the
right
kind
the
good
barth
all
praise
to
him
has
already
done
something
of
the
kind
for
certain
parts
of
italy
but
does
not
so
much
as
mention
calabria
and
yet
here
nearly
every
village
has
its
own
type
of
wine
and
every
family
its
own
peculiar
method
of
preparation
little
known
though
they
be
outside
the
place
of
production
on
account
of
the
octroi
laws
which
strangle
internal
trade
and
remove
all
stimulus
to
manufacture
a
good
article
for
export
this
wine
of
ciro
for
instance
is
purest
nectar
and
so
is
that
which
grows
still
nearer
at
hand
in
the
classical
vale
of
the
neto
and
was
praised
long
ago
by
old
pliny
and
so
are
at
least
two
dozen
more
for
even
as
gregorovius
says
that
the
smallest
italian
community
possesses
its
duly
informed
antiquarian
if
you
can
but
put
your
hand
upon
him
so
i
may
be
allowed
to
add
every
little
place
hereabouts
can
boast
of
at
least
one
individual
who
will
give
you
good
wine
provided
provided
you
go
properly
to
work
to
find
him
now
although
when
young
the
calabrian
bacchus
has
a
du
which
appeals
to
one
expansive
moods
he
already
begins
to
totter
at
seven
years
of
age
in
sour
decrepit
eld
to
pounce
upon
him
at
the
psychological
moment
to
discover
in
whose
cool
and
cobwebby
cellar
he
is
dreaming
out
his
golden
summer
of
manhood
that
is
what
a
foreigner
can
never
never
hope
to
achieve
without
competent
local
aid
to
this
end
i
generally
apply
to
the
priests
not
because
they
are
the
greatest
drunkards
far
from
it
they
are
mildly
epicurean
or
even
abstemious
but
by
reason
of
their
unrivalled
knowledge
of
personalities
they
know
exactly
who
has
been
able
to
keep
his
liquor
of
such
and
such
a
year
and
who
has
been
obliged
to
sell
or
partially
adulterate
it
they
know
from
the
confessional
of
the
wives
the
why
and
wherefore
of
all
such
private
family
affairs
and
share
with
the
chemist
the
gift
of
seeing
furthest
into
the
tangled
web
of
home
life
they
are
gialosi
however
of
these
acquirements
and
must
be
approached
in
the
right
spirit
a
spirit
of
humility
but
if
you
tactfully
lead
up
to
the
subject
by
telling
of
the
manifold
hardships
of
travel
in
foreign
lands
the
discomfort
of
life
in
hostelries
the
food
that
leaves
so
much
to
be
desired
and
above
all
the
coarse
wine
that
is
already
beginning
you
greatly
fear
to
injure
your
sensitive
spleen
an
important
organ
in
calabria
inducing
a
hypochondriacal
tendency
to
see
all
the
beauties
of
this
fair
land
in
an
odious
and
sombre
light
turning
your
day
into
night
as
it
were
it
must
be
an
odd
priest
indeed
who
is
not
compassionately
moved
to
impart
the
desired
information
regarding
the
whereabouts
of
the
best
di
at
that
moment
obtainable
after
all
it
costs
him
nothing
to
do
a
double
favour
one
to
yourself
and
another
to
the
proprietor
of
the
wine
doubtless
an
old
friend
of
his
who
will
be
able
to
sell
his
stuff
to
a
foreigner
per
cent
dearer
than
to
a
native
and
failing
the
priests
i
go
to
an
elderly
individual
of
that
tribe
of
connaisseurs
the
coachmen
ever
thirsty
and
mercenary
souls
who
for
a
small
consideration
may
be
able
to
disclose
not
only
this
secret
but
others
far
more
mysterious
as
to
your
host
at
the
inn
he
raises
not
the
least
objection
to
your
importing
alien
liquor
into
his
house
his
own
wine
he
tells
you
is
last
year
vintage
and
somewhat
harsh
slightly
watered
he
might
add
and
why
not
the
ordinary
customers
are
gentlemen
of
commerce
who
do
care
a
fig
what
they
eat
and
drink
so
long
as
there
is
enough
of
it
no
horrible
suggestions
are
proffered
concerning
corkage
on
the
contrary
he
tests
your
wine
smacks
his
lips
and
thanks
you
for
communicating
a
valuable
discovery
he
thinks
he
will
buy
a
bottle
or
two
for
the
use
of
himself
and
a
few
particular
friends
midnight
has
come
and
gone
the
street
is
emptying
the
footsteps
of
passengers
begin
to
ring
hollow
i
arise
for
my
customary
stroll
in
the
direction
of
the
cemetery
to
attune
myself
to
repose
by
shaking
off
those
restlessly
trivial
images
of
humanity
which
might
otherwise
haunt
my
slumbers
town
visions
are
soon
left
behind
it
is
very
quiet
here
under
the
hot
starlit
heavens
nothing
speaks
of
man
save
the
lighthouse
flashing
in
ghostly
activity
no
it
is
a
fixed
light
on
the
distant
cape
of
the
column
and
nothing
breaks
the
stillness
save
the
rhythmic
breathing
of
the
waves
and
a
solitary
cricket
that
has
yet
to
finish
his
daily
task
of
instrumental
music
far
away
in
some
warm
crevice
of
the
hills
a
suave
odour
rises
up
from
the
narrow
patch
of
olives
and
figs
loaded
with
fruit
and
ripening
vines
that
skirts
the
path
by
the
beach
fig
tree
putteth
forth
her
green
figs
and
the
vines
with
the
tender
grape
give
a
good
and
so
i
plough
my
way
through
the
sand
in
the
darkness
encompassed
by
tepid
exhalations
of
earth
and
sea
another
spirit
has
fallen
upon
me
a
spirit
of
biblical
calm
here
then
stood
rejoicing
city
that
dwelt
carelessly
that
said
in
her
heart
i
am
and
there
is
none
beside
me
how
is
she
become
a
desolation
it
is
indeed
hard
to
realize
that
a
town
thronged
with
citizens
covered
all
this
area
yet
so
it
is
every
footstep
is
a
memory
along
this
very
track
walked
the
sumptuous
ladies
of
croton
on
their
way
to
deposit
their
vain
jewels
before
the
goddess
hera
at
the
bidding
of
pythagoras
on
this
spot
maybe
stood
that
public
hall
which
was
specially
built
for
the
delivery
of
his
lectures
no
doubt

sunk
in
apathetic
luxury
the

a
messiah

lo
he
appeared
xxxviii
the
sage
of
croton
the
popularity
of
this
sage
at
croton
offers
no
problem
the
inhabitants
had
become
sufficiently
civilized
to
appreciate
the
charm
of
being
regenerated
we
all
do
renunciation
has
always
exercised
an
irresistible
attraction
for
good
society
it
makes
us
feel
so
comfortable
to
be
told
we
are
going
to
hell
and
pythagoras
was
very
eloquent
on
the
subject
of
tartarus
as
a
punishment
the
crotoniates
discovered
in
repentance
of
sins
a
new
and
subtle
form
of
pleasure
exactly
as
did
the
florentines
when
savonarola
appeared
on
the
scene
next
his
doctrines
found
a
ready
soil
in
magna
graecia
which
was
already
impregnated
with
certain
vague
notions
akin
to
those
he
introduced
and
then
he
permitted
and
even
encouraged
the
emotional
sex
to
participate
in
the
mysteries
the
same
tactics
that
later
on
materially
helped
the
triumph
of
christianity
over
the
more
exclusive
and
rational
cult
of
mithra
lastly
he
came
with
a
message
like
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
and
in
those
times
a
preaching
reformer
was
a
novelty
that
added
a
zest
we
know
them
a
little
better
nowadays
he
enjoyed
the
specious
and
success
that
has
attended
elsewhere
such
efforts
to
cultivate
the
at
the
expense
of
its
environment
a
type
of
aspiring
humanity
says
gissing
echoing
the
sentiments
of
many
of
us
a
sweet
and
noble
figure
moving
as
a
dim
radiance
through
legendary
hellas
i
fancy
that
the
mist
of
centuries
of
undiscriminating
admiration
has
magnified
this
figure
out
of
all
proportion
and
contrived
furthermore
to
fix
an
iridescent
nimbus
of
sanctity
about
its
head
such
things
have
been
known
to
happen
in
foggy
weather
was
greece
so
very
legendary
in
those
times
why
on
the
contrary
it
was
full
of
real
personages
of
true
sages
to
whom
it
seemed
as
if
no
secrets
of
heaven
or
earth
were
past
fathoming
far
from
being
legendary
the
countryhad
never
attained
a
higher
plane
of
intellectual
curiosity
than
when
pythagoras
made
his
appearance
and
it
can
not
be
gainsaid
that
he
and
his
disciples
gave
the
impetus
away
from
these
wise
and
beneficial
researches
into
the
arid
regions
of
metaphysics
it
is
so
much
more
gentlemanly
and
so
much
easier
to
talk
bland
balderdash
about
than
to
calculate
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
or
bother
about
the
circulation
of
the
blood
that
a
man
of
his
speculative
vigour
knowing
so
many
races
should
have
hit
upon
one
or
two
good
things
adventitiously
is
only
to
be
expected
but
they
were
mere
one
might
as
well
praise
john
knox
for
creating
the
commons
of
scotland
with
a
view
to
the
future
prosperity
of
that
country
a
consummation
which
his
black
fanaticism
assuredly
never
foresaw
the
chief
practical
doctrine
of
pythagoras
that
mankind
are
to
be
governed
on
the
principle
of
a
community
of
eastern
monks
makes
for
the
disintegration
of
rational
civic
life
and
his
chief
theoretical
doctrines
of
metempsychosis
and
the
reduction
of
everything
to
a
system
of
numbers
footnote
vincenzo
dorsa
an
albanian
has
written
two
pamphlets
on
the
survival
of
traditions
in
calabria
they
are
difficult
to
procure
but
whoever
is
lucky
enough
to
find
them
will
be
much
helped
in
his
understanding
of
the
common
people
in
one
place
he
speaks
of
the
of
it
is
considered
meet
and
proper
in
the
presence
of
a
suckling
infant
to
spit
thrice
and
then
call
out
three
times
this
brings
luck
and
the
practice
he
thinks
is
an
echo
of
the
of
pythagoras
these
are
sheer
lunacy
was
it
not
something
of
a
relapse
after
the
rigorous
mental
discipline
of
old
to
have
a
man
gravely
assuring
his
fellows
that
he
is
the
son
of
hermes
and
the
divinely
appointed
messenger
of
apollo
treating
diseases
like
an
eskimo
angekok
by
incantation
recording
veracious
incidents
of
his
experiences
during
a
previous
life
in
hell
which
he
seems
to
have
explored
almost
as
thoroughly
as
swedenborg
dabbling
in
magic
and
consulting
dreams
birds
and
the
smoke
of
incense
as
oracles
and
in
the
exotic
conglomerate
of
his
teachings
are
to
be
found
the
of
much
that
is
worse
the
theory
of
the
pious
fraud
which
has
infected
latin
countries
to
this
day
the
jesuitical
maxim
of
the
end
justifying
the
means
the
insanity
of
preferring
deductions
to
facts
which
has
degraded
philosophy
up
to
the
days
of
kant
mysticism
and
much
else
of
pernicious
mettle
they
are
all
there
embryonically
embedded
in
pythagoras
we
are
told
much
of
his
charity
indeed
an
english
author
has
written
a
learned
work
to
prove
that
pythagoreanism
has
close
affinities
with
christianity
charity
has
now
been
tried
on
an
ample
scale
and
has
proved
a
dismal
failure
to
give
they
say
is
more
blessed
than
to
receive
it
is
certainly
far
easier
for
the
most
part
to
give
than
to
refrain
from
giving
we
are
at
last
shaking
off
the
form
of
called
charity
we
realize
that
if
mankind
is
to
profit
sterner
conceptions
must
prevail
the
apotheosis
of
the
loafer
is
drawing
to
a
close
for
the
rest
there
was
the
inevitable
admixture
of
quackery
about
our
reforming
sage
his
warmest
admirers
can
not
but
admit
that
he
savours
somewhat
strongly
of
the
holy
impostor
those
charms
and
amulets
those
dark
gnomic
aphorisms
which
constitute
the
of
all
religious
the
bribe
of
future
life
the
sacerdotal
tinge
with
its
complement
of
mendacity
the
secrecy
of
doctrine
the
the
sacred
quaternion
the
he
had
the
true
maraboutic
note
and
for
me
this
regenerator
crowned
with
a
saintly
aureole
remains
a
glorified
marabout
an
intellectual
dissolvent
the
importer
of
that
oriental
introspectiveness
which
culminated
in
the
yearnings
of
plato
paved
the
way
for
the
quaint
alexandrian
known
as
christianity
and
tainted
the
of
honest
research
for
two
thousand
years
by
their
works
ye
shall
known
them
it
was
the
pythagoreans
who
not
content
with
a
just
victory
over
the
sybarites
annihilated
their
city
amid
anathemas
worthy
of
those
old
chaldeans
past
masters
in
the
art
of
pious
cursings
a
crime
against
their
common
traditions
and
common
interests
a
piece
of
savagery
which
wrecked
hellenic
civilization
in
italy
it
is
ever
thus
when
the
soul
is
appointed
arbiter
over
reason
it
is
ever
thus
when
gentle
dreamers
meddle
with
worldly
affairs
beware
of
the
wrath
of
the
lamb
so
rapidly
did
the
virus
act
that
soon
we
find
plato
declaring
that
all
the
useful
arts
are
that
so
long
as
a
man
tries
to
study
any
sensible
object
he
can
never
be
said
to
be
learning
anything
in
other
words
that
the
kind
of
person
to
whom
one
looks
for
common
sense
should
be
excluded
from
the
management
of
his
most
refined
republic
it
needed
courage
of
a
rather
droll
kind
to
make
such
propositions
in
greece
under
the
shadow
of
the
parthenon
and
hand
in
hand
with
this
feudalism
in
philosophy
there
began
that
unhealthy
preoccupation
with
the
morals
of
our
that
miasma
of
puritanism
which
has
infected
life
and
literature
up
to
this
moment
the
renaissance
brought
many
fine
things
to
england
but
the
wicked
fairy
was
there
with
her
gift
pythagoras
and
plato
we
were
not
like
the
italians
who
after
the
first
rapture
of
discovery
was
over
soon
outgrew
these
distracted
dialectics
we
stuck
fast
in
them
hence
our
platonic
touch
our
attitude
in
matters
of
the
mind
our
academic
horror
of
clean
thinking
how
plato
hated
a
fact
he
could
find
no
place
for
it
in
his
twilight
world
of
abstractions
was
it
not
he
who
wished
to
burn
the
works
of
democritus
of
abdera
most
exact
and
reasonable
of
old
sages
they
are
all
alike
these
humanitarian
lovers
of
first
causes
always
ready
to
burn
something
or
somebody
always
ready
with
their
cheerful
and
gnashing
of
teeth
thyself
to
what
depths
of
vain
egocentric
brooding
has
that
dictum
led
but
we
are
discarding
now
such
a
mischievously
narrow
view
of
the
cosmos
though
our
upbringing
is
still
too
rhetorical
and
mediaeval
to
appraise
its
authors
at
their
true
worth
youth
is
prone
to
judge
with
the
heart
rather
than
the
head
youth
thrives
on
vaporous
ideas
and
there
was
a
time
when
i
would
have
yielded
to
none
in
my
enthusiasm
for
these
mellifluous
babblers
one
had
a
blind
sentimental
regard
for
their
great
names
it
seems
to
me
now
that
we
take
them
somewhat
too
seriously
that
a
healthy
adult
has
nothing
to
learn
from
their
teachings
save
by
way
of
warning
example
plato
is
food
for
adolescents
and
a
comfort
possibly
in
old
age
when
the
judicial
faculties
of
the
mind
are
breaking
up
and
primitive
man
the
visionary
reasserts
his
ancient
rights
for
questioning
moods
grow
burdensome
with
years
after
a
strain
of
virile
doubt
we
are
glad
to
acquiesce
once
more
to
relapse
into
platonic
animism
the
logic
of
valetudinarians
the
dog
to
his
vomit
and
after
plato
the
deluge
yet
it
was
quite
good
sport
while
it
lasted
to
make
men
better
by
choice
dissertations
about
utopias
to
sit
in
marble
halls
and
have
a
fair
and
fondly
ardent
reclining
about
your
knees
while
you
discourse
in
rounded
periods
concerning
the
salvation
of
their
souls
by
means
of
transcendental
love
it
would
suit
me
well
enough
at
this
present
moment
far
better
than
croaking
forlorn
as
the
among
the
ruins
of
their
radiant
lives
meanwhile
and
despite
our
universities
new
conceptions
are
prevailing
aristotle
is
winning
the
day
a
fresh
kind
of
thinker
has
arisen
whose
chief
idea
of
virtue
is
to
investigate
patiently
the
facts
of
life
men
of
the
type
of
lister
any
one
of
whom
have
done
more
to
regenerate
mankind
and
to
increase
the
sum
of
human
happiness
than
a
wilderness
of
the
old
doctrinaires
who
professed
the
same
object
i
call
to
mind
those
physicians
engaged
in
their
and
wonder
what
plato
would
have
thought
of
them
would
he
have
recognized
the
significance
of
their
researches
which
while
allaying
pain
and
misery
are
furthering
the
prosperity
of
the
country
causing
waters
to
flow
in
dry
places
and
villages
to
spring
up
in
deserts
strengthening
its
political
resources
improving
its
very
appearance
not
likely
opinion
of
doctors
was
on
a
par
with
the
rest
of
his
mentality
yet
these
are
the
men
who
are
taking
up
the
thread
where
it
was
dropped
perforce
by
those
veritable
greek
sages
whelmed
under
turbid
floods
of
pythagorean
irrationalism
and
are
such
things
purely
utilitarian
are
they
so
grossly
mundane
is
there
really
no
philosophy
in
the
choice
of
such
a
healing
career
no
romance
in
its
studious
no
beauty
in
its
results
if
so
we
must
revise
that
classic
adage
which
connects
vigour
with
beauty
not
to
speak
of
several
others

the

is
not
my
ideal
of
enjoyment
the
novelty
of
such
an
experience
having
worn
off
a
good
many
years
ago
i
decide
to
wait
to
make
an
attack
meanwhile
upon
old
petelia
the
stromboli
of
my
at
the
catanzaro
museum
it
is
an
easy
day
excursion
from
cotrone
to
strongoli
which
is
supposed
to
lie
on
the
site
of
that
ancient
town
it
sits
upon
a
and
the
diligence
which
awaits
the
traveller
at
the
little
takes
about
two
hours
to
reach
the
place
climbing
up
the
slopes
in
ample
loops
and
windings
of
strangoli
my
memories
even
at
this
short
distance
of
time
are
confused
and
blurred
the
drive
up
under
the
glowing
beams
of
morning
the
great
heat
of
the
last
few
days
and
two
or
three
sleeplessness
at
cotrone
had
considerably
blunted
my
appetite
for
new
things
i
remember
seeing
some
roman
marbles
in
the
church
and
being
thence
conducted
into
a
castle
afterwards
i
reposed
awhile
in
the
upper
regions
under
an
olive
and
looked
down
towards
the
valley
of
the
neto
which
flows
not
far
from
here
into
the
ionian
i
thought
upon
theocritus
trying
to
picture
this
vale
of
neaithos
as
it
appeared
to
him
and
his
shepherds
the
woodlands
are
gone
and
the
rains
of
winter
streaming
down
the
earthen
slopes
have
remodelled
the
whole
face
of
the
country
yet
be
nature
what
it
may
men
will
always
turn
to
one
who
sings
so
melodiously
of
eternal
verities
of
those
human
tasks
and
needs
which
no
lapse
of
years
can
change
how
modern
he
reads
to
us
who
have
been
brought
into
contact
with
the
true
spirit
by
men
like
and
lefroy
and
how
unbelievably
remote
is
that
which
went
before
what
for
example
what
of
the
renowned
salamon
gessner
who
sang
of
this
same
vale
of
neto
in
his
daphnis
alas
the
good
salamon
has
gone
the
way
of
all
derivative
bores
he
is
dead
deader
than
king
psammeticus
he
is
now
moralizing
in
some
decorous
paradise
amid
flocks
of
sheep
and
youths
and
maidens
who
can
read
his
masterpiece
without
unpleasant
twinges
dead
as
a
doornail
so
far
as
i
can
recollect
there
is
an
infinity
of
kissing
in
daphnis
it
was
an
age
of
sentimentality
and
the
greek
pastoral
ideal
transfused
into
a
swiss
environment
of
could
not
but
end
in
slobber
and
true
it
is
that
shepherds
have
ample
opportunities
of
sporting
with
amaryllis
in
the
shade
opportunities
which
to
my
certain
knowledge
they
do
not
neglect
theocritus
knew
it
well
enough
but
in
a
general
way
he
is
niggardly
with
the
precious
commodity
of
kisses
he
seems
to
have
thought
that
in
literature
if
not
in
real
life
one
can
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
also
being
a
southerner
he
could
not
have
trusted
his
young
folks
to
remain
eternally
at
the
after
the
pattern
of
our
english
lovers
such
behaviour
would
have
struck
him
as
improbable
possibly
immoral
from
where
i
sat
one
may
trace
a
road
that
winds
upwards
into
the
sila
past
pallagorio
along
its
sides
are
certain
mounded
heaps
and
the
smoke
of
refining
works
these
are
mines
of
that
dusky
sulphur
which
i
had
observed
being
drawn
in
carts
through
the
streets
of
cotrone
there
are
some
eight
or
ten
of
them
they
tell
me
discovered
about
thirty
years
ago
this
is
all
wrong
they
are
mentioned
in
and
employing
several
hundred
workmen
it
had
been
my
intention
to
visit
these
excavations
but
now
in
the
heat
of
day
i
wavered
the
distance
even
to
the
nearest
of
them
seemed
inordinately
great
and
just
as
i
had
decided
to
look
for
a
carnage
with
a
view
of
being
driven
there
that
curse
of
conscientiousness
an
amiable
citizen
snatched
me
up
as
his
guest
for
luncheon
he
led
me
weakly
resisting
to
a
vaulted
chamber
where
amid
a
repast
of
rural
delicacies
and
the
converse
of
his
spouse
all
such
fond
projects
were
straightway
forgotten
instead
of
i
learnt
a
little
piece
of
local
history
you
were
speaking
about
the
emptiness
of
our
streets
of
strangoli
my
host
said
and
yet
up
to
a
short
time
ago
there
was
no
emigration
from
this
place
then
a
change
came
about
i
tell
you
how
it
was
there
was
a
di
here
a
miserable
octroi
official
to
keep
up
the
name
of
his
family
he
married
an
heiress
not
for
the
sake
of
having
progeny
but
well
he
began
buying
up
all
the
land
round
about
slowly
systematically
cautiously
till
by
dint
of
threats
and
intrigues
he
absorbed
nearly
all
the
surrounding
country
inch
by
inch
he
ate
it
up
with
his
wife
money
that
was
his
idea
of
perpetuating
his
memory
all
the
small
proprietors
were
driven
from
their
domains
and
fled
to
america
to
escape
starvation
immense
tracts
of
land
are
now
almost
desert
look
at
the
country
but
some
day
he
will
get
his
reward
under
the
ribs
you
know
by
this
purposeful
of
those
feudal
conditions
of
olden
days
this
man
has
become
the
person
in
the
district
soon
it
was
time
to
leave
the
friendly
shelter
and
inspect
in
the
glaring
sunshine
the
remaining
antiquities
of
petelia
never
have
i
felt
less
inclined
for
such
antiquarian
exploits
how
much
better
the
hours
would
have
passed
in
some
cool
tavern
i
went
forth
none
the
less
and
was
delighted
to
discover
that
there
are
practically
no
antiquities
left
nothing
save
a
few
walls
standing
near
a
now
ruined
convent
which
is
largely
built
of
roman
and
bricks
up
to
a
few
years
ago
the
municipality
carried
on
excavations
here
and
unearthed
a
few
relics
which
were
promptly
dispersed
perhaps
some
of
these
are
what
one
sees
in
the
catanzaro
museum
the
paternal
government
hearing
of
this
enterprise
claimed
the
site
and
sat
down
upon
it
the
exposed
remains
were
once
more
covered
up
with
soil
a
a
sad
little
fellow
sprang
out
of
the
earth
as
i
dutifully
wandered
about
here
he
volunteered
to
show
me
not
only
strongoli
but
all
calabria
in
fact
his
heart
desire
was
soon
manifest
to
escape
from
home
and
find
his
way
to
america
under
my
passport
and
protection
here
was
his
chance
a
foreigner
american
returning
sooner
or
later
to
his
own
country
he
pressed
the
matter
with
naif
forcefulness
vainly
i
told
him
that
there
were
other
lands
on
earth
that
i
was
not
going
to
america
he
shook
his
head
and
sagely
remarked
i
have
understood
you
think
my
journey
would
cost
too
much
but
you
also
must
understand
once
i
get
work
there
i
will
repay
you
every
farthing
as
a
consolation
i
offered
him
some
cigarettes
he
accepted
one
pensive
unresigned
the
had
no
such
cravings
in
the
days
of
theocritus
xl
the
column
two
hours
three
hours
four
hours
according
the
boatmen
are
still
eager
for
the
voyage
it
all
depends
as
before
upon
the
wind
and
day
day
ionian
lies
before
us
immaculate
immutable
i
determined
to
approach
the
column
by
land
a
mule
was
discovered
and
starting
from
the
concordia
rather
late
in
the
morning
reached
the
in
two
hours
to
the
minute
i
might
have
been
tempted
to
linger
by
the
way
but
for
the
intense
sunshine
and
for
the
fact
that
the
muleteer
was
an
exceptionally
dull
dog
a
dusky
youth
of
the
taciturn
and
spanish
variety
whose
profile
irked
me
in
that
landscape
the
driving
road
ends
at
the
cemetery
thence
onward
a
pathway
skirts
the
sea
at
the
foot
of
the
passes
the
sunken
wells
climbs
up
and
down
steepish
gradients
and
so
attains
the
plateau
at
whose
extremity
stands
the
lighthouse
the
column
and
a
few
white
bungalows
of
cotrone
citizens
a
day
of
shimmering
heat
the
ground
is
parched
altogether
it
is
a
poor
and
thinly
peopled
stretch
of
land
between
cotrone
and
capo
rizzuto
no
wonder
the
wolves
are
famished
nine
days
ago
one
of
them
actually
ventured
upon
the
road
near
the
cemetery
in
daylight
yet
there
is
some
and
i
was
pleased
to
see
emerging
from
the
bleak
the
tufts
of
the
and
conspicuous
sea
lily
in
full
flower
wishful
to
obtain
a
few
blossoms
i
asked
the
boy
to
descend
from
his
mule
but
he
objected
non
si
toccano
questi
fiori
he
said
these
flowers
are
not
to
be
touched
their
odour
displeased
him
like
the
arab
the
uncultivated
italian
is
insensitive
to
certain
smells
that
revolt
us
while
he
can
not
endure
on
the
other
hand
the
scent
of
some
flowers
i
have
seen
a
man
professing
to
feel
faint
at
the
odour
of
crushed
geranium
leaves
they
are
di
morti
he
says
planted
sometimes
in
graveyards
the
last
remarkable
antiquity
found
at
this
site
to
my
knowledge
is
a
stone
vase
fished
up
some
years
ago
out
of
the
sea
into
which
it
may
have
fallen
while
being
carried
off
by
pious
marauders
for
the
purpose
of
figuring
as
font
in
some
church
unless
indeed
the
land
has
sunk
at
this
point
as
there
is
some
evidence
to
show
i
saw
it
shortly
after
its
return
to
dry
land
in
a
shed
near
the
harbour
of
cotrone
the
taranto
museum
has
now
claimed
it
it
is
a
basin
of
pavonazzetto
marble
originally
a
monolith
it
now
consists
of
two
fragments
the
third
and
smallest
is
still
missing
this
noble
relic
stands
about
centimetres
in
height
and
measures
some
centimetres
in
circumference
it
was
never
completed
as
can
be
seen
by
the
rim
which
is
still
partially
in
the
rough
a
similar
vessel
is
figured
i
believe
in
tischbein
the
small
on
this
promontory
is
deserted
owing
to
lack
of
water
every
drop
of
which
has
to
be
brought
hither
by
sea
from
cotrone
one
wonders
why
they
have
not
thought
of
building
a
cistern
to
catch
the
winter
rains
if
there
are
any
for
a
respectable
stone
crops
up
at
this
end
of
the
peninsula
one
often
wonders
at
things
the
column
has
been
underpinned
and
strengthened
by
a
foundation
of
cement
rains
of
centuries
had
begun
to
threaten
its
base
and
there
was
some
risk
of
a
catastrophe
near
at
hand
are
a
few
ancient
walls
of
reticulated
masonry
in
strangely
leaning
attitudes
peopled
by
black
goats
on
the
ground
i
picked
up
some
chips
of
amphorse
and
vases
as
well
as
a
fragment
of
the
limb
of
a
marble
statue
the
site
of
this
pillar
fronting
the
waves
is
impressively
forlorn
and
it
was
rather
thoughtful
after
all
of
the
despoiling
bishop
lucifero
to
leave
two
of
the
columns
standing
upright
on
the
spot
as
a
sample
of
the
local
doric
style
one
has
fallen
to
earth
since
his
day
nobody
would
have
complained
at
the
time
if
he
had
stolen
all
of
them
instead
of
only
i
took
a
picture
of
the
survivor
then
wandered
a
little
apart
in
the
direction
of
the
shore
and
soon
found
myself
in
a
solitude
of
burning
stones
a
miniature
sahara
the
temple
has
vanished
together
with
the
sacred
grove
that
once
embowered
it
the
island
of
calypso
where
swinburne
took
his
ease
if
such
it
was
has
sunk
into
the
purple
realms
of
glaucus
the
corals
and
that
writhed
among
its
crevices
are
under
mounds
of
submarine
sand
there
was
life
once
at
this
promontory
argosies
touched
here
leaving
priceless
gifts
fountains
flowed
and
cornfields
waved
in
the
genial
sunshine
doubtless
there
will
be
life
again
earth
and
sea
are
only
waiting
for
the
enchanter
wand
all
now
lies
bare
swooning
in
summer
stagnation
calabria
is
not
a
land
to
traverse
alone
it
is
too
wistful
and
stricken
too
deficient
in
those
externals
that
conduce
to
comfort
its
charms
do
not
appeal
to
the
eye
of
romance
and
the
man
who
would
perambulate
magna
graecia
as
he
does
the
alps
would
soon
regret
his
choice
one
needs
something
of
that
human
element
which
delighted
the
genteel
photographer
of
morano
comrades
in
short
if
only
those
sages
like
old
noia
molisi
who
have
fallen
under
the
spell
of
its
ancient
glories
the
joys
of
calabria
are
not
to
be
bought
like
those
of
switzerland
for
gold
giovati
battista
di
noia
molisi
the
last
of
his
family
and
name
having
no
sons
and
being
come
to
old
age
without
further
hope
of
offspring
has
desired
in
the
place
of
children
to
leave
of
himself
an
eternal
memory
to
mankind
to
wit
this
chronicle
of
the
most
ancient
magnificent
and
faithful
city
of
cotrone
a
worthier
effort
at
than
that
of
strangoli
a
sturgeon
he
notes
was
caught
in
by
the
spanish
castellan
of
the
town
this
nobleman
puzzling
whom
he
could
best
honour
with
so
rare
a
dainty
despatched
it
by
means
of
a
man
on
horseback
to
the
duke
of
nocera
the
duke
was
no
less
surprised
than
pleased
he
thought
mighty
well
of
the
sturgeon
and
of
the
respectful
consideration
which
prompted
the
gift
and
then
by
another
horseman
sent
it
to
noia
molisi
own
uncle
accompanied
we
may
conjecture
by
some
ceremonious
compliment
befitting
the
occasion
a
man
of
parts
therefore
our
author
uncle
to
whom
his
lordship
of
nocera
sends
by
mounted
messenger
and
himself
a
mellow
comrade
whom
i
am
loath
to
leave
his
pages
are
distinguished
by
a
pleasing
absence
of
those
saintly
paraphernalia
which
hang
like
a
fog
athwart
the
fair
sky
of
the
south
yet
to
him
and
to
all
of
them
i
must
bid
here
and
now
at
this
hour
i
shall
be
far
from
cotrone
farewell
to
capialbi
inspired
bookworm
and
to
lenormant
on
a
day
like
this
the
scholar
sailed
at
bivona
over
a
sea
so
unruffled
that
the
barque
seemed
to
be
suspended
in
air
the
water
surface
he
tells
us
is
unie
comme
une
glace
he
sees
the
vitreous
depths
invaded
by
piercing
sunbeams
that
light
up
its
mysterious
forests
of
algae
its
and
silvery
stretches
of
sand
he
peers
down
into
these
prairies
pélagiennes
and
beholds
all
their
wondrous
fauna
the
urchins
the
crabs
the
floating
fishes
and
translucent
medusae
semblables
a
des
clochettes
then
realizing
how
this
population
pullulante
des
petits
animaux
marins
must
have
impressed
the
observing
ancients
he
goes
on
to
touch
ever
so
lightly
upon
those
old
local
arts
of
ornamentation
whereby
and
molluscs
and
aquatic
plants
were
reverently
copied
by
not
from
dead
specimens
but
pris
sur
le
vif
et
observes
au
milieu
des
eaux
he
explains
how
an
entire
school
grew
up
which
drew
its
inspiration
from
the
dainty
apes
and
movements
of
these
frail
creatures
this
is
meilleur
his
was
a
yet
discriminating
zest
of
knowledge
one
wonders
what
more
was
fermenting
in
that
restlessly
curious
brain
when
a
miserable
accident
ended
his
short
life
after
days
of
suffering
so
italy
proved
fatal
to
him
as
greece
to
his
father
but
one
of
his
happiest
moments
must
have
been
spent
on
the
sea
at
bivona
on
that
clear
summer
day
a
day
such
as
this
when
every
nerve
tingles
with
joy
of
life
meanwhile
it
is
good
to
rest
here
immovable
but
alert
in
the
breathless
hush
of
noon
showers
of
benevolent
heat
stream
down
upon
this
desolation
not
the
faintest
wisp
of
vapour
floats
upon
the
horizon
not
a
sail
not
a
ripple
disquiets
the
waters
the
silence
can
be
felt
slumber
is
brooding
over
the
things
of
earth
asleep
are
the
peaks
of
the
hills
and
the
vales
the
promontories
the
clefts
and
all
the
creatures
that
move
upon
the
black
earth
such
torrid
splendour
drenching
a
land
of
austerut
simplicity
decomposes
the
mind
into
corresponding
states
of
primal
contentment
and
resilience
there
arises
before
our
phantasy
a
new
perspective
of
human
affairs
a
suggestion
of
wherein
the
futile
complexities
and
disharmonies
of
our
age
shall
have
no
place
to
discard
these
wrappings
to
claim
kinship
with
some
elemental
and
robust
archetype
lover
of
earth
and
sun
how
fair
they
are
these
moments
of
golden
equipoise
yes
it
is
good
to
be
merged
awhile
into
these
surroundings
into
the
meridian
glow
of
all
things
this
noontide
is
the
heavy
hour
of
the
greeks
when
temples
are
untrodden
by
priest
or
worshipper
they
now
call
it
the
ominous
hour
man
and
beast
are
fettered
in
sleep
while
spirits
walk
abroad
as
at
midnight
timebis
a
timore
noctuno
a
sagitta
volante
in
àie
a
negotio
perambulante
in
tenebris
ab
incursu
et
demonio
the
midday
demon
that
southern
haunter
of
calm
blue
spaces
so
may
some
enchantment
of
kindlier
intent
have
crept
over
phaedrus
and
his
friend
at
converse
in
the
noontide
under
the
whispering
and
the
genius
dwelling
about
this
old
headland
of
the
column
is
candid
and
benign
this
corner
of
magna
graecia
is
a
severely
parsimonious
manifestation
of
nature
rocks
and
waters
but
these
rocks
and
waters
are
actualities
the
stuff
whereof
man
is
made
a
landscape
so
luminous
so
resolutely
scornful
of
accessories
hints
at
brave
and
simple
forms
of
expression
it
brings
us
to
the
ground
where
we
belong
it
medicines
to
the
disease
of
introspection
and
stimulates
a
capacity
which
we
are
in
danger
of
unlearning
amid
our
morbid
hyperborean
gloom
the
capacity
for
honest
contempt
contempt
of
that
scarecrow
of
a
theory
which
would
have
us
neglect
what
is
earthly
tangible
what
is
life
well
lived
but
a
blithe
discarding
of
primordial
husks
of
those
comfortable
intangibilities
that
lurk
about
us
waiting
for
our
weak
moments
the
sage
that
perfect
savage
will
be
the
last
to
withdraw
himself
from
the
influence
of
these
radiant
realities
he
will
strive
to
knit
closer
the
bond
and
to
devise
a
more
durable
and
affectionate
relationship
between
himself
and
them
let
him
open
his
eyes
for
a
reasonable
adjustment
lies
at
his
feet
from
these
brown
stones
that
seam
the
tranquil
ionian
from
this
gracious
solitude
he
can
carve
out
and
bear
away
into
the
cheerful
din
of
cities
the
rudiments
of
something
clean
and
veracious
and
wholly
terrestrial
some
tonic
philosophy
that
shall
foster
sunny
mischiefs
and
farewell
regret
