and
likewise
the

the
humble
dedication
of
their
devoted
admirer
sheweth
that
your
dedicator
has
perused
with
feelings
of
virtuous
indignation
a
work
purporting
to
be
sketches
of
young
ladies
written
by
quiz
illustrated
by
phiz
and
published
in
one
volume
square
twelvemo
that
after
an
attentive
and
vigilant
perusal
of
the
said
work
your
dedicator
is
humbly
of
opinion
that
so
many
libels
upon
your
honourable
sex
were
never
contained
in
any
previously
published
work
in
twelvemo
or
any
other
mo
that
in
the
title
page
and
preface
to
the
said
work
your
honourable
sex
are
described
and
classified
as
animals
and
although
your
dedicator
is
not
at
present
prepared
to
deny
that
you
animals
still
he
humbly
submits
that
it
is
not
polite
to
call
you
so
that
in
the
aforesaid
preface
your
honourable
sex
are
also
described
as
troglodites
which
being
a
hard
word
may
for
aught
your
honourable
sex
or
your
dedicator
can
say
to
the
contrary
be
an
injurious
and
disrespectful
appellation
that
the
author
of
the
said
work
applied
himself
to
his
task
in
malice
prepense
and
with
wickedness
aforethought
a
fact
which
your
dedicator
contends
is
sufficiently
demonstrated
by
his
assuming
the
name
of
quiz
which
your
dedicator
submits
denotes
a
foregone
conclusion
and
implies
an
intention
of
quizzing
that
in
the
execution
of
his
evil
design
the
said
quiz
or
author
of
the
said
work
must
have
betrayed
some
trust
or
confidence
reposed
in
him
by
some
members
of
your
honourable
sex
otherwise
he
never
could
have
acquired
so
much
information
relative
to
the
manners
and
customs
of
your
honourable
sex
in
general
that
actuated
by
these
considerations
and
further
moved
by
various
slanders
and
insinuations
respecting
your
honourable
sex
contained
in
the
said
work
square
twelvemo
entitled
sketches
of
young
ladies
your
dedicator
ventures
to
produce
another
work
square
twelvemo
entitled
sketches
of
young
gentlemen
of
which
he
now
solicits
your
acceptance
and
approval
that
as
the
young
ladies
are
the
best
companions
of
the
young
gentlemen
so
the
young
gentlemen
should
be
the
best
companions
of
the
young
ladies
and
extending
the
comparison
from
animals
to
quote
the
disrespectful
language
of
the
said
quiz
to
inanimate
objects
your
dedicator
humbly
suggests
that
such
of
your
honourable
sex
as
purchased
the
bane
should
possess
themselves
of
the
antidote
and
that
those
of
your
honourable
sex
who
were
not
rash
enough
to
take
the
first
should
lose
no
time
in
swallowing
the
last
being
in
all
cases
better
than
cure
as
we
are
informed
upon
the
authority
not
only
of
general
acknowledgment
but
also
of
traditionary
wisdom
that
with
reference
to
the
said
bane
and
antidote
your
dedicator
has
no
further
remarks
to
make
than
are
comprised
in
the
printed
directions
issued
with
doctor
morison
s
pills
namely
that
whenever
your
honourable
sex
take
of
number
you
will
be
pleased
to

of

conclusion
the
bashful
young
gentleman
we
found
ourself
seated
at
a
small
dinner
party
the
other
day
opposite
a
stranger
of
such
singular
appearance
and
manner
that
he
irresistibly
attracted
our
attention
this
was
a
young
gentleman
with
as
good
a
promise
of
light
whisker
as
one
might
wish
to
see
and
possessed
of
a
very
countenance
we
do
not
use
the
latter
term
invidiously
but
merely
to
denote
a
pair
of
smooth
plump
cheeks
of
capacious
dimensions
and
a
mouth
rather
remarkable
for
the
fresh
hue
of
the
lips
than
for
any
marked
or
striking
expression
it
presented
his
whole
face
was
suffused
with
a
crimson
blush
and
bore
that
downcast
timid
retiring
look
which
betokens
a
man
ill
at
ease
with
himself
there
was
nothing
in
these
symptoms
to
attract
more
than
a
passing
remark
but
our
attention
had
been
originally
drawn
to
the
bashful
young
gentleman
on
his
first
appearance
in
the
into
which
he
was
no
sooner
introduced
than
making
his
way
towards
us
who
were
standing
in
a
window
and
wholly
neglecting
several
persons
who
warmly
accosted
him
he
seized
our
hand
with
visible
emotion
and
pressed
it
with
a
convulsive
grasp
for
a
good
couple
of
minutes
after
which
he
dived
in
a
nervous
manner
across
the
room
oversetting
in
his
way
a
fine
little
girl
of
six
years
and
a
quarter
shrouding
himself
behind
some
hangings
was
seen
no
more
until
the
eagle
eye
of
the
hostess
detecting
him
in
his
concealment
on
the
announcement
of
dinner
he
was
requested
to
pair
off
with
a
lively
single
lady
of
two
or
three
and
thirty
this
most
flattering
salutation
from
a
perfect
stranger
would
have
gratified
us
not
a
little
as
a
token
of
his
having
held
us
in
high
respect
and
for
that
reason
been
desirous
of
our
acquaintance
if
we
had
not
suspected
from
the
first
that
the
young
gentleman
in
making
a
desperate
effort
to
get
through
the
ceremony
of
introduction
had
in
the
bewilderment
of
his
ideas
shaken
hands
with
us
at
random
this
impression
was
fully
confirmed
by
the
subsequent
behaviour
of
the
bashful
young
gentleman
in
question
which
we
noted
particularly
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
whether
we
were
right
in
our
conjecture
the
young
gentleman
seated
himself
at
table
with
evident
misgivings
and
turning
sharp
round
to
pay
attention
to
some
observation
of
his
loquacious
neighbour
overset
his
bread
there
was
nothing
very
bad
in
this
and
if
he
had
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
let
it
go
and
say
nothing
about
it
nobody
but
the
man
who
had
laid
the
cloth
would
have
been
a
bit
the
wiser
but
the
young
gentleman
in
various
attempts
to
prevent
its
fall
played
with
it
a
little
as
gentlemen
in
the
streets
may
be
seen
to
do
with
their
hats
on
a
windy
day
and
then
giving
the
roll
a
smart
rap
in
his
anxiety
to
catch
it
knocked
it
with
great
adroitness
into
a
tureen
of
white
soup
at
some
distance
to
the
unspeakable
terror
and
disturbance
of
a
very
amiable
bald
gentleman
who
was
dispensing
the
contents
we
thought
the
bashful
young
gentleman
would
have
gone
off
in
an
apoplectic
fit
consequent
upon
the
violent
rush
of
blood
to
his
face
at
the
occurrence
of
this
catastrophe
from
this
moment
we
perceived
in
the
phraseology
of
the
fancy
that
it
was
all
up
with
the
bashful
young
gentleman
and
so
indeed
it
was
several
benevolent
persons
endeavoured
to
relieve
his
embarrassment
by
taking
wine
with
him
but
finding
that
it
only
augmented
his
sufferings
and
that
after
mingling
sherry
champagne
hock
and
moselle
together
he
applied
the
greater
part
of
the
mixture
externally
instead
of
internally
they
gradually
dropped
off
and
left
him
to
the
exclusive
care
of
the
talkative
lady
who
not
noting
the
wildness
of
his
eye
firmly
believed
she
had
secured
a
listener
he
broke
a
glass
or
two
in
the
course
of
the
meal
and
disappeared
shortly
afterwards
it
is
inferred
that
he
went
away
in
some
confusion
inasmuch
as
he
left
the
house
in
another
gentleman
s
coat
and
the
footman
s
hat
this
little
incident
led
us
to
reflect
upon
the
most
prominent
characteristics
of
bashful
young
gentlemen
in
the
abstract
and
as
this
portable
volume
will
be
the
great
of
young
ladies
in
all
future
generations
we
record
them
here
for
their
guidance
and
behoof
if
the
bashful
young
gentleman
in
turning
a
street
corner
chance
to
stumble
suddenly
upon
two
or
three
young
ladies
of
his
acquaintance
nothing
can
exceed
his
confusion
and
agitation
his
first
impulse
is
to
make
a
great
variety
of
bows
and
dart
past
them
which
he
does
until
observing
that
they
wish
to
stop
but
are
uncertain
whether
to
do
so
or
not
he
makes
several
feints
of
returning
which
causes
them
to
do
the
same
and
at
length
after
a
great
quantity
of
unnecessary
dodging
and
falling
up
against
the
other
passengers
he
returns
and
shakes
hands
most
affectionately
with
all
of
them
in
doing
which
he
knocks
out
of
their
grasp
sundry
little
parcels
which
he
hastily
picks
up
and
returns
very
muddy
and
disordered
the
chances
are
that
the
bashful
young
gentleman
then
observes
it
is
very
fine
weather
and
being
reminded
that
it
has
only
just
left
off
raining
for
the
first
time
these
three
days
he
blushes
very
much
and
smiles
as
if
he
had
said
a
very
good
thing
the
young
lady
who
was
most
anxious
to
speak
here
inquires
with
an
air
of
great
commiseration
how
his
dear
sister
harriet
is
to
which
the
young
gentleman
without
the
slightest
consideration
replies
with
many
thanks
that
she
is
remarkably
well
well
hopkins
cries
the
young
lady
why
we
heard
she
was
bled
yesterday
evening
and
have
been
perfectly
miserable
about
oh
ah
says
the
young
gentleman
so
she
was
oh
she
s
very
ill
very
ill
the
young
gentleman
then
shakes
his
head
and
looks
very
desponding
he
has
been
smiling
perpetually
up
to
this
time
and
after
a
short
pause
gives
his
glove
a
great
wrench
at
the
wrist
and
says
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
adjective
morning
and
making
a
great
number
of
bows
in
acknowledgment
of
several
little
messages
to
his
sister
walks
backward
a
few
paces
and
comes
with
great
violence
against
a
knocking
his
hat
off
in
the
contact
which
in
his
mental
confusion
and
bodily
pain
he
is
going
to
walk
away
without
until
a
great
roar
from
a
carter
attracts
his
attention
when
he
picks
it
up
and
tries
to
smile
cheerfully
to
the
young
ladies
who
are
looking
back
and
who
he
has
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
are
all
laughing
heartily
at
a
quadrille
party
the
bashful
young
gentleman
always
remains
as
near
the
entrance
of
the
room
as
possible
from
which
position
he
smiles
at
the
people
he
knows
as
they
come
in
and
sometimes
steps
forward
to
shake
hands
with
more
intimate
friends
a
process
which
on
each
repetition
seems
to
turn
him
a
deeper
scarlet
than
before
he
declines
dancing
the
first
set
or
two
observing
in
a
faint
voice
that
he
would
rather
wait
a
little
but
at
length
is
absolutely
compelled
to
allow
himself
to
be
introduced
to
a
partner
when
he
is
led
in
a
great
heat
and
blushing
furiously
across
the
room
to
a
spot
where
unknown
ladies
are
congregated
together
miss
lambert
let
me
introduce
hopkins
for
the
next
miss
lambert
inclines
her
head
graciously
hopkins
bows
and
his
fair
conductress
disappears
leaving
hopkins
as
he
too
well
knows
to
make
himself
agreeable
the
young
lady
more
than
half
expects
that
the
bashful
young
gentleman
will
say
something
and
the
bashful
young
gentleman
feeling
this
seriously
thinks
whether
he
has
got
anything
to
say
which
upon
mature
reflection
he
is
rather
disposed
to
conclude
he
has
not
since
nothing
occurs
to
him
meanwhile
the
young
lady
after
several
inspections
of
her
all
made
in
the
expectation
that
the
bashful
young
gentleman
is
going
to
talk
whispers
her
mamma
who
is
sitting
next
her
which
whisper
the
bashful
young
gentleman
immediately
suspects
and
possibly
with
very
good
reason
must
be
about
in
this
comfortable
condition
he
remains
until
it
is
time
to
stand
up
when
murmuring
a
will
you
allow
me
he
gives
the
young
lady
his
arm
and
after
inquiring
where
she
will
stand
and
receiving
a
reply
that
she
has
no
choice
conducts
her
to
the
remotest
corner
of
the
quadrille
and
making
one
attempt
at
conversation
which
turns
out
a
desperate
failure
preserves
a
profound
silence
until
it
is
all
over
when
he
walks
her
twice
round
the
room
deposits
her
in
her
old
seat
and
retires
in
confusion
a
married
bashful
these
bashful
gentlemen
do
get
married
sometimes
how
it
is
ever
brought
about
is
a
mystery
to
married
bashful
gentleman
either
causes
his
wife
to
appear
bold
by
contrast
or
merges
her
proper
importance
in
his
own
insignificance
bashful
young
gentlemen
should
be
cured
or
avoided
they
are
never
hopeless
and
never
will
be
while
female
beauty
and
attractions
retain
their
influence
as
any
young
lady
will
find
who
may
think
it
worth
while
on
this
confident
assurance
to
take
a
patient
in
hand
the
young
gentleman
young
gentlemen
may
be
divided
into
two
who
have
something
to
do
and
those
who
have
nothing
i
shall
commence
with
the
former
because
that
species
come
more
frequently
under
the
notice
of
young
ladies
whom
it
is
our
province
to
warn
and
to
instruct
the
young
gentleman
is
usually
no
great
dresser
his
instructions
to
his
tailor
being
all
comprehended
in
the
one
general
direction
to
make
that
what
a
regular
sort
of
for
some
years
past
the
favourite
costume
of
the
young
gentleman
has
been
a
rough
pilot
coat
with
two
gilt
hooks
and
eyes
to
the
velvet
collar
buttons
somewhat
larger
than
a
black
or
fancy
neckerchief
loosely
tied
a
hat
with
a
low
crown
tightish
inexpressibles
and
boots
out
of
doors
he
sometimes
carries
a
large
ash
stick
but
only
on
special
occasions
for
he
prefers
keeping
his
hands
in
his
coat
pockets
he
smokes
at
all
hours
of
course
and
swears
considerably
picture
the
young
gentleman
the
young
gentleman
is
employed
in
a
city
or
solicitor
s
office
in
which
he
does
as
little
as
he
possibly
can
his
chief
places
of
resort
are
the
streets
the
taverns
and
the
theatres
in
the
streets
at
evening
time
young
gentlemen
have
a
pleasant
custom
of
walking
six
or
eight
abreast
thus
driving
females
and
other
inoffensive
persons
into
the
road
which
never
fails
to
afford
them
the
highest
satisfaction
especially
if
there
be
any
immediate
danger
of
their
being
run
over
which
enhances
the
fun
of
the
thing
materially
in
all
places
of
public
resort
the
are
careful
to
select
each
a
seat
to
himself
upon
which
he
lies
at
full
length
and
if
the
weather
be
very
dirty
but
not
in
any
other
case
he
lies
with
his
knees
up
and
the
soles
of
his
boots
planted
firmly
on
the
cushion
so
that
if
any
low
fellow
should
ask
him
to
make
room
for
a
lady
he
takes
ample
revenge
upon
her
dress
without
going
at
all
out
of
his
way
to
do
it
he
always
sits
with
his
hat
on
and
flourishes
his
stick
in
the
air
while
the
play
is
proceeding
with
a
dignified
contempt
of
the
performance
if
it
be
possible
for
one
or
two
young
gentlemen
to
get
up
a
little
crowding
in
the
passages
they
are
quite
in
their
element
squeezing
pushing
whooping
and
shouting
in
the
most
humorous
manner
possible
if
they
can
only
succeed
in
irritating
the
gentleman
who
has
a
family
of
daughters
under
his
charge
they
are
like
to
die
with
laughing
and
boast
of
it
among
their
companions
for
a
week
afterwards
adding
that
one
or
two
of
them
were
devilish
fine
girls
and
that
they
really
thought
the
youngest
would
have
fainted
which
was
the
only
thing
wanted
to
render
the
joke
complete
if
the
young
gentleman
have
a
mother
and
sisters
of
course
he
treats
them
with
becoming
contempt
inasmuch
as
they
poor
things
having
no
notion
of
life
or
gaiety
are
far
too
and
moping
for
him
sometimes
however
on
a
or
at
he
can
not
very
well
help
accompanying
them
to
a
party
at
some
old
friend
s
with
which
view
he
comes
home
when
they
have
been
dressed
an
hour
or
two
smelling
very
strongly
of
tobacco
and
spirits
and
after
exchanging
his
rough
coat
for
some
more
suitable
attire
in
which
however
he
loses
nothing
of
the
gets
into
the
coach
and
grumbles
all
the
way
at
his
own
good
nature
his
bitter
reflections
aggravated
by
the
recollection
that
tom
smith
has
taken
the
chair
at
a
little
impromptu
dinner
at
a
fighting
man
s
and
that
a
was
to
take
place
on
a
between
the
fighting
man
and
his
which
is
probably
coming
off
at
that
very
instant
as
the
young
gentleman
is
by
no
means
at
his
ease
in
ladies
society
he
shrinks
into
a
corner
of
the
when
they
reach
the
friend
s
and
unless
one
of
his
sisters
is
kind
enough
to
talk
to
him
remains
there
without
being
much
troubled
by
the
attentions
of
other
people
until
he
espies
lingering
outside
the
door
another
gentleman
whom
he
at
once
knows
by
his
air
and
manner
for
there
is
a
kind
of
in
the
craft
to
be
a
brother
and
towards
whom
he
accordingly
makes
his
way
conversation
being
soon
opened
by
some
casual
remark
the
second
confidentially
informs
the
first
that
he
is
one
of
the
rough
sort
and
hates
that
kind
of
thing
only
he
couldn
t
very
well
be
off
coming
to
which
the
other
replies
that
that
s
just
his
and
i
ll
tell
you
what
continues
the
in
a
whisper
i
should
like
a
glass
of
warm
brandy
and
water
just
now
or
a
pint
of
stout
and
a
pipe
suggests
the
other
the
discovery
is
at
once
made
that
they
are
sympathetic
souls
each
of
them
says
at
the
same
moment
that
he
sees
the
other
understands
what
s
what
and
they
become
fast
friends
at
once
more
especially
when
it
appears
that
the
second
is
no
other
than
a
gentleman
long
favourably
known
to
his
familiars
as
mr
warmint
blake
who
upon
divers
occasions
has
distinguished
himself
in
a
manner
that
would
not
have
disgraced
the
fighting
man
and
been
a
pretty
long
time
about
the
honour
of
once
shaking
hands
with
the
celebrated
thurtell
himself
at
supper
these
gentlemen
greatly
distinguish
themselves
brightening
up
very
much
when
the
ladies
leave
the
table
and
proclaiming
aloud
their
intention
of
beginning
to
spend
the
process
which
is
generally
understood
to
be
satisfactorily
performed
when
a
great
deal
of
wine
is
drunk
and
a
great
deal
of
noise
made
both
of
which
feats
the
young
gentlemen
execute
to
perfection
having
protracted
their
sitting
until
long
after
the
host
and
the
other
guests
have
adjourned
to
the
and
finding
that
they
have
drained
the
decanters
empty
they
follow
them
thither
with
complexions
rather
heightened
and
faces
rather
bloated
with
wine
and
the
agitated
lady
of
the
house
whispers
her
friends
as
they
waltz
together
to
the
great
terror
of
the
whole
room
that
both
blake
and
dummins
are
very
nice
sort
of
young
men
in
their
way
only
they
are
eccentric
persons
and
unfortunately
too
the
remaining
class
of
young
gentlemen
is
composed
of
persons
who
having
no
money
of
their
own
and
a
soul
above
earning
any
enjoy
similar
pleasures
nobody
knows
how
these
respectable
gentlemen
without
aiming
quite
so
much
at
the
in
external
appearance
are
distinguished
by
all
the
same
amiable
and
attractive
characteristics
in
an
equal
or
perhaps
greater
degree
and
now
and
then
find
their
way
into
society
through
the
medium
of
the
other
class
of
young
gentlemen
who
will
sometimes
carry
them
home
and
who
usually
pay
their
tavern
bills
as
they
are
equally
gentlemanly
clever
witty
intelligent
wise
and
we
need
scarcely
have
recommended
them
to
the
peculiar
consideration
of
the
young
ladies
if
it
were
not
that
some
of
the
gentle
creatures
whom
we
hold
in
such
high
respect
are
perhaps
a
little
too
apt
to
confound
a
great
many
heavier
terms
with
the
light
word
eccentricity
which
we
beg
them
henceforth
to
take
in
a
strictly
johnsonian
sense
without
any
liberality
or
latitude
of
construction
the
very
friendly
young
gentleman
we
all
people
many
specimens
of
this
class
that
in
selecting
the
few
heads
our
limits
enable
us
to
take
from
a
great
number
we
have
been
induced
to
give
the
very
friendly
young
gentleman
the
preference
over
many
others
to
whose
claims
upon
a
more
cursory
view
of
the
question
we
had
felt
disposed
to
assign
the
priority
the
very
friendly
young
gentleman
is
very
friendly
to
everybody
but
he
attaches
himself
particularly
to
two
or
at
most
to
three
families
regulating
his
choice
by
their
dinners
their
circle
of
acquaintance
or
some
other
criterion
in
which
he
has
an
immediate
interest
he
is
of
any
age
between
twenty
and
forty
unmarried
of
course
must
be
fond
of
children
and
is
expected
to
make
himself
generally
useful
if
possible
let
us
illustrate
our
meaning
by
an
example
which
is
the
shortest
mode
and
the
clearest
we
encountered
one
day
by
chance
an
old
friend
of
whom
we
had
lost
sight
for
some
years
and
a
strong
anxiety
to
renew
our
former
us
to
dine
with
him
on
an
early
day
that
we
might
talk
over
old
times
we
readily
assented
adding
that
we
hoped
we
should
be
alone
oh
certainly
certainly
said
our
friend
not
a
soul
with
us
but
and
who
is
mincin
was
our
natural
inquiry
o
don
t
mind
him
replied
our
friend
he
s
a
most
particular
friend
of
mine
and
a
very
friendly
fellow
you
will
find
him
and
so
he
left
us
we
thought
no
more
about
mincin
until
we
duly
presented
ourselves
at
the
house
next
day
when
after
a
hearty
welcome
our
friend
motioned
towards
a
gentleman
who
had
been
previously
showing
his
teeth
by
the
fireplace
and
gave
us
to
understand
that
it
was
mincin
of
whom
he
had
spoken
it
required
no
great
penetration
on
our
part
to
discover
at
once
that
mincin
was
in
every
respect
a
very
friendly
young
gentleman
i
am
delighted
said
mincin
hastily
advancing
and
pressing
our
hand
warmly
between
both
of
his
i
am
delighted
i
am
sure
to
make
your
here
he
smiled
much
delighted
here
he
exhibited
a
little
emotion
assure
you
that
i
have
looked
forward
to
it
anxiously
for
a
very
long
time
here
he
released
our
hands
and
rubbing
his
own
observed
that
the
day
was
severe
but
that
he
was
delighted
to
perceive
from
our
appearance
that
it
agreed
with
us
wonderfully
and
then
went
on
to
observe
that
notwithstanding
the
coldness
of
the
weather
he
had
that
morning
seen
in
the
paper
an
exceedingly
curious
paragraph
to
the
effect
that
there
was
now
in
the
garden
of
wilkins
of
chichester
a
pumpkin
measuring
four
feet
in
height
and
eleven
feet
seven
inches
in
circumference
which
he
looked
upon
as
a
very
extraordinary
piece
of
intelligence
we
ventured
to
remark
that
we
had
a
dim
recollection
of
having
once
or
twice
before
observed
a
similar
paragraph
in
the
public
prints
upon
which
mincin
took
us
confidentially
by
the
button
and
said
exactly
exactly
to
be
sure
we
were
very
right
and
he
wondered
what
the
editors
meant
by
putting
in
such
things
who
the
deuce
he
should
like
to
know
did
they
suppose
cared
about
them
that
struck
him
as
being
the
best
of
it
the
lady
of
the
house
appeared
shortly
afterwards
and
mincin
s
friendliness
as
will
readily
be
supposed
suffered
no
diminution
in
consequence
he
exerted
much
strength
and
skill
in
wheeling
a
large
up
to
the
fire
and
the
lady
being
seated
in
it
carefully
closed
the
door
stirred
the
fire
and
looked
to
the
windows
to
see
that
they
admitted
no
air
having
satisfied
himself
upon
all
these
points
he
expressed
himself
quite
easy
in
his
mind
and
begged
to
know
how
she
found
herself
upon
the
lady
s
replying
very
well
mincin
who
it
appeared
was
a
medical
gentleman
offered
some
general
remarks
upon
the
nature
and
treatment
of
colds
in
the
head
which
occupied
us
agreeably
until
during
the
meal
he
devoted
himself
to
complimenting
everybody
not
forgetting
himself
so
that
we
were
an
uncommonly
agreeable
quartette
i
ll
tell
you
what
capper
said
mincin
to
our
host
as
he
closed
the
room
door
after
the
lady
had
retired
you
have
very
great
reason
to
be
fond
of
your
wife
sweet
woman
capper
sir
nay
beg
interposed
the
host
as
we
were
about
to
reply
that
capper
unquestionably
was
particularly
sweet
pray
mincin
don
why
not
exclaimed
mincin
why
not
why
should
you
feel
any
delicacy
before
your
old
old
friend
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
call
you
so
sir
why
should
you
i
ask
we
of
course
wished
to
know
why
he
should
also
upon
which
our
friend
admitted
that
capper
a
very
sweet
woman
at
which
admission
mincin
cried
bravo
and
begged
to
propose
capper
with
heartfelt
enthusiasm
whereupon
our
host
said
thank
you
mincin
with
deep
feeling
and
gave
us
in
a
low
voice
to
understand
that
mincin
had
saved
capper
s
cousin
s
life
no
less
than
fourteen
times
in
a
year
and
a
half
which
he
considered
no
common
opinion
to
which
we
most
cordially
subscribed
now
that
we
three
were
left
to
entertain
ourselves
with
conversation
mincin
s
extreme
friendliness
became
every
moment
more
apparent
he
was
so
amazingly
friendly
indeed
that
it
was
impossible
to
talk
about
anything
in
which
he
had
not
the
chief
concern
we
happened
to
allude
to
some
affairs
in
which
our
friend
and
we
had
been
mutually
engaged
nearly
fourteen
years
before
when
mincin
was
all
at
once
reminded
of
a
joke
which
our
friend
had
made
on
that
day
four
years
which
he
positively
must
insist
upon
which
he
did
tell
accordingly
with
many
pleasant
recollections
of
what
he
said
and
what
capper
said
and
how
he
well
remembered
that
they
had
been
to
the
play
with
orders
on
the
very
night
previous
and
had
seen
romeo
and
juliet
and
the
pantomime
and
how
capper
being
faint
had
been
led
into
the
lobby
where
she
smiled
said
it
was
nothing
after
all
and
went
back
again
with
many
other
interesting
and
absorbing
particulars
after
which
the
friendly
young
gentleman
went
on
to
assure
us
that
our
friend
had
experienced
a
marvellously
prophetic
opinion
of
that
same
pantomime
which
was
of
such
an
admirable
kind
that
two
morning
papers
took
the
same
view
next
day
to
this
our
friend
replied
with
a
little
triumph
that
in
that
instance
he
had
some
reason
to
think
he
had
been
correct
which
gave
the
friendly
young
gentleman
occasion
to
believe
that
our
friend
was
always
correct
and
so
we
went
on
until
our
friend
filling
a
bumper
said
he
must
drink
one
glass
to
his
dear
friend
mincin
than
whom
he
would
say
no
man
saved
the
lives
of
his
acquaintances
more
or
had
a
more
friendly
heart
finally
our
friend
having
emptied
his
glass
said
god
bless
you
mincin
mincin
and
he
shook
hands
across
the
table
with
much
affection
and
earnestness
but
great
as
the
friendly
young
gentleman
is
in
a
limited
scene
like
this
he
plays
the
same
part
on
a
larger
scale
with
increased
mincin
is
invited
to
an
evening
party
with
his
dear
friends
the
martins
where
he
meets
his
dear
friends
the
cappers
and
his
dear
friends
the
watsons
and
a
hundred
other
dear
friends
too
numerous
to
mention
he
is
as
much
at
home
with
the
martins
as
with
the
cappers
but
how
exquisitely
he
balances
his
attentions
and
divides
them
among
his
dear
friends
if
he
flirts
with
one
of
the
miss
watsons
he
has
one
little
martin
on
the
sofa
pulling
his
hair
and
the
other
little
martin
on
the
carpet
riding
on
his
foot
he
carries
watson
down
to
supper
on
one
arm
and
miss
martin
on
the
other
and
takes
wine
so
judiciously
and
in
such
exact
order
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
most
punctilious
old
lady
to
consider
herself
neglected
if
any
young
lady
being
prevailed
upon
to
sing
become
nervous
afterwards
mincin
leads
her
tenderly
into
the
next
room
and
restores
her
with
port
wine
which
she
must
take
medicinally
if
any
gentleman
be
standing
by
the
piano
during
the
progress
of
the
ballad
mincin
seizes
him
by
the
arm
at
one
point
of
the
melody
and
softly
beating
time
the
while
with
his
head
expresses
in
dumb
show
his
intense
perception
of
the
delicacy
of
the
passage
if
anybody
s
is
to
be
flattered
mincin
is
at
hand
if
anybody
s
overweening
vanity
is
to
be
pampered
mincin
will
surfeit
it
what
wonder
that
people
of
all
stations
and
ages
recognise
mincin
s
friendliness
that
he
is
universally
allowed
to
be
handsome
as
amiable
that
mothers
think
him
an
oracle
daughters
a
dear
brothers
a
beau
and
fathers
a
wonder
and
who
would
not
have
the
reputation
of
the
very
friendly
young
gentleman
the
military
young
gentleman
we
are
rather
at
a
loss
to
imagine
how
it
has
come
to
pass
that
military
young
gentlemen
have
obtained
so
much
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
ladies
of
this
kingdom
we
can
not
think
so
lightly
of
them
as
to
suppose
that
the
mere
circumstance
of
a
man
s
wearing
a
red
coat
ensures
him
a
ready
passport
to
their
regard
and
even
if
this
were
the
case
it
would
be
no
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
circumstance
because
although
the
analogy
may
in
some
degree
hold
good
in
the
case
of
mail
coachmen
and
guards
still
general
postmen
wear
red
coats
and
are
not
to
our
knowledge
better
received
than
other
men
nor
are
firemen
either
who
wear
or
used
to
wear
not
only
red
coats
but
very
resplendent
and
massive
badges
larger
than
epaulettes
neither
do
the
twopenny
boys
if
the
result
of
our
inquiries
be
correct
find
any
peculiar
favour
in
woman
s
eyes
although
they
wear
very
bright
red
jackets
and
have
the
additional
advantage
of
constantly
appearing
in
public
on
horseback
which
last
circumstance
may
be
naturally
supposed
to
be
greatly
in
their
favour
we
have
sometimes
thought
that
this
phenomenon
may
take
its
rise
in
the
conventional
behaviour
of
captains
and
colonels
and
other
gentlemen
in
red
coats
on
the
stage
where
they
are
invariably
represented
as
fine
swaggering
fellows
talking
of
nothing
but
charming
girls
their
king
and
country
their
honour
and
their
debts
and
crowing
over
the
inferior
classes
of
the
community
whom
they
occasionally
treat
with
a
little
gentlemanly
swindling
no
less
to
the
improvement
and
pleasure
of
the
audience
than
to
the
satisfaction
and
approval
of
the
choice
spirits
who
consort
with
them
but
we
will
not
devote
these
pages
to
our
speculations
upon
the
subject
inasmuch
as
our
business
at
the
present
moment
is
not
so
much
with
the
young
ladies
who
are
bewitched
by
her
majesty
s
livery
as
with
the
young
gentlemen
whose
heads
are
turned
by
it
for
heads
we
had
written
brains
but
upon
consideration
we
think
the
former
the
more
appropriate
word
of
the
two
picture
the
military
young
gentleman
these
young
gentlemen
may
be
divided
into
two
gentlemen
who
are
actually
in
the
army
and
young
gentlemen
who
having
an
intense
and
enthusiastic
admiration
for
all
things
appertaining
to
a
military
life
are
compelled
by
adverse
fortune
or
adverse
relations
to
wear
out
their
existence
in
some
ignoble
we
will
take
this
latter
description
of
military
young
gentlemen
first
the
whole
heart
and
soul
of
the
military
young
gentleman
are
concentrated
in
his
favourite
topic
there
is
nothing
that
he
is
so
learned
upon
as
uniforms
he
will
tell
you
without
faltering
for
an
instant
what
the
habiliments
of
any
one
regiment
are
turned
up
with
what
regiment
wear
stripes
down
the
outside
and
inside
of
the
leg
and
how
many
buttons
the
tenth
had
on
their
coats
he
knows
to
a
fraction
how
many
yards
and
odd
inches
of
gold
lace
it
takes
to
make
an
ensign
in
the
guards
is
deeply
read
in
the
comparative
merits
of
different
bands
and
the
apparelling
of
trumpeters
and
is
very
luminous
indeed
in
descanting
upon
crack
regiments
and
the
crack
gentlemen
who
compose
them
of
whose
mightiness
and
grandeur
he
is
never
tired
of
telling
we
were
suggesting
to
a
military
young
gentleman
only
the
other
day
after
he
had
related
to
us
several
dazzling
instances
of
the
profusion
of
honourable
ensign
somebodies
or
nobodies
in
the
articles
of
kid
gloves
and
polished
boots
that
possibly
cracked
regiments
would
be
an
improvement
upon
crack
as
being
a
more
expressive
and
appropriate
designation
when
he
suddenly
interrupted
us
by
pulling
out
his
watch
and
observing
that
he
must
hurry
off
to
the
park
in
a
cab
or
he
would
be
too
late
to
hear
the
band
play
not
wishing
to
interfere
with
so
important
an
engagement
and
being
in
fact
already
slightly
overwhelmed
by
the
anecdotes
of
the
honourable
ensigns
we
made
no
attempt
to
detain
the
military
young
gentleman
but
parted
company
with
ready
some
three
or
four
hours
afterwards
we
chanced
to
be
walking
down
whitehall
on
the
admiralty
side
of
the
way
when
as
we
drew
near
to
one
of
the
little
stone
places
in
which
a
couple
of
horse
soldiers
mount
guard
in
the
daytime
we
were
attracted
by
the
motionless
appearance
and
eager
gaze
of
a
young
gentleman
who
was
devouring
both
man
and
horse
with
his
eyes
so
eagerly
that
he
seemed
deaf
and
blind
to
all
that
was
passing
around
him
we
were
not
much
surprised
at
the
discovery
that
it
was
our
friend
the
military
young
gentleman
but
we
a
little
astonished
when
we
returned
from
a
walk
to
south
lambeth
to
find
him
still
there
looking
on
with
the
same
intensity
as
before
as
it
was
a
very
windy
day
we
felt
bound
to
awaken
the
young
gentleman
from
his
reverie
when
he
inquired
of
us
with
great
enthusiasm
whether
that
was
not
a
glorious
spectacle
and
proceeded
to
give
us
a
detailed
account
of
the
weight
of
every
article
of
the
spectacle
s
trappings
from
the
man
s
gloves
to
the
horse
s
shoes
we
have
made
it
a
practice
since
to
take
the
horse
guards
in
our
daily
walk
and
we
find
it
is
the
custom
of
military
young
gentlemen
to
plant
themselves
opposite
the
sentries
and
contemplate
them
at
leisure
in
periods
varying
from
fifteen
minutes
to
fifty
and
averaging
we
were
much
struck
a
day
or
two
since
by
the
behaviour
of
a
very
promising
young
butcher
who
evincing
an
interest
in
the
service
which
can
not
be
too
strongly
commanded
or
encouraged
after
a
prolonged
inspection
of
the
sentry
proceeded
to
handle
his
boots
with
great
curiosity
and
as
much
composure
and
indifference
as
if
the
man
were
but
the
really
military
young
gentleman
is
waiting
all
this
time
and
at
the
very
moment
that
an
apology
rises
to
our
lips
he
emerges
from
the
barrack
gate
he
is
quartered
in
a
garrison
town
and
takes
the
way
towards
the
high
street
he
wears
his
undress
uniform
which
somewhat
mars
the
glory
of
his
outward
man
but
still
how
great
how
grand
he
is
what
a
happy
mixture
of
ease
and
ferocity
in
his
gait
and
carriage
and
how
lightly
he
carries
that
dreadful
sword
under
his
arm
making
no
more
ado
about
it
than
if
it
were
a
silk
umbrella
the
lion
is
sleeping
only
think
if
an
enemy
were
in
sight
how
soon
he
d
whip
it
out
of
the
scabbard
and
what
a
terrible
fellow
he
would
be
but
he
walks
on
thinking
of
nothing
less
than
blood
and
slaughter
and
now
he
comes
in
sight
of
three
other
military
young
gentlemen
who
are
bearing
down
towards
him
clanking
their
iron
heels
on
the
pavement
and
clashing
their
swords
with
a
noise
which
should
cause
all
peaceful
men
to
quail
at
heart
they
stop
to
talk
see
how
the
young
gentleman
with
the
weak
who
has
his
thrust
into
the
breast
of
his
upon
the
fainthearted
civilians
who
linger
to
look
upon
his
glory
how
the
next
young
gentleman
elevates
his
head
in
the
air
and
majestically
places
his
arms
while
the
third
stands
with
his
legs
very
wide
apart
and
clasps
his
hands
behind
him
well
may
we
in
familiar
jest
but
in
respectful
you
call
that
nothing
oh
if
some
encroaching
foreign
emperor
of
russia
for
instance
or
any
of
those
deep
fellows
could
only
see
those
military
young
gentlemen
as
they
move
on
together
towards
the
over
the
way
wouldn
t
he
tremble
a
little
and
then
at
the
theatre
at
night
when
the
performances
are
by
command
of
colonel
and
the
officers
of
the
a
splendid
sight
it
is
how
sternly
the
defenders
of
their
country
look
round
the
house
as
if
in
mute
assurance
to
the
audience
that
they
may
make
themselves
comfortable
regarding
any
foreign
invasion
for
they
the
military
young
gentlemen
are
keeping
a
sharp
and
are
ready
for
anything
and
what
a
contrast
between
them
and
that
full
of
officers
with
tokens
of
many
battles
about
them
who
have
nothing
at
all
in
common
with
the
military
young
gentlemen
and
for
an
kind
of
manly
dignity
in
their
looks
and
be
common
soldiers
for
anything
they
take
the
pains
to
announce
to
the
contrary
ah
here
is
a
family
just
come
in
who
recognise
the
young
gentleman
and
the
young
gentleman
recognises
them
too
only
he
doesn
t
care
to
show
it
just
now
very
well
done
indeed
he
talks
louder
to
the
little
group
of
military
young
gentlemen
who
are
standing
by
him
and
coughs
to
induce
some
ladies
in
the
next
box
but
one
to
look
round
in
order
that
their
faces
may
undergo
the
same
ordeal
of
criticism
to
which
they
have
subjected
in
not
a
wholly
inaudible
tone
the
majority
of
the
female
portion
of
the
audience
oh
a
gentleman
in
the
same
box
looks
round
as
if
he
were
disposed
to
resent
this
as
an
impertinence
and
the
young
gentleman
sees
his
friends
at
once
and
hurries
away
to
them
with
the
most
charming
cordiality
three
young
ladies
one
young
man
and
the
mamma
of
the
party
receive
the
military
young
gentleman
with
great
warmth
and
politeness
and
in
five
minutes
afterwards
the
military
young
gentleman
stimulated
by
the
mamma
introduces
the
two
other
military
young
gentlemen
with
whom
he
was
walking
in
the
morning
who
take
their
seats
behind
the
young
ladies
and
commence
conversation
whereat
the
mamma
bestows
a
triumphant
bow
upon
a
rival
mamma
who
has
not
succeeded
in
decoying
any
military
young
gentlemen
and
prepares
to
consider
her
visitors
from
that
moment
three
of
the
most
elegant
and
superior
young
gentlemen
in
the
whole
world
the
political
young
gentleman
once
upon
a
in
the
days
when
pigs
drank
wine
but
in
a
more
recent
period
of
our
was
customary
to
banish
politics
when
ladies
were
present
if
this
usage
still
prevailed
we
should
have
had
no
chapter
for
political
young
gentlemen
for
ladies
would
have
neither
known
nor
cared
what
kind
of
monster
a
political
young
gentleman
was
but
as
this
good
custom
in
common
with
many
others
has
gone
out
and
left
no
word
when
it
is
likely
to
be
home
again
as
political
young
ladies
are
by
no
means
rare
and
political
young
gentlemen
the
very
reverse
of
scarce
we
are
bound
in
the
strict
discharge
of
our
most
responsible
duty
not
to
neglect
this
natural
division
of
our
subject
if
the
political
young
gentleman
be
resident
in
a
country
town
and
there
political
young
gentlemen
in
country
towns
sometimes
he
is
wholly
absorbed
in
his
politics
as
a
pair
of
purple
spectacles
communicate
the
same
uniform
tint
to
all
objects
near
and
remote
so
the
political
glasses
with
which
the
young
gentleman
assists
his
mental
vision
give
to
everything
the
hue
and
tinge
of
party
feeling
the
political
young
gentleman
would
as
soon
think
of
being
struck
with
the
beauty
of
a
young
lady
in
the
opposite
interest
as
he
would
dream
of
marrying
his
sister
to
the
opposite
member
if
the
political
young
gentleman
be
a
conservative
he
has
usually
some
vague
ideas
about
ireland
and
the
pope
which
he
can
not
very
clearly
explain
but
which
he
knows
are
the
right
sort
of
thing
and
not
to
be
very
easily
got
over
by
the
other
side
he
has
also
some
choice
sentences
regarding
church
and
state
culled
from
the
banners
in
use
at
the
last
election
with
which
he
intersperses
his
conversation
at
intervals
with
surprising
effect
but
his
great
topic
is
the
constitution
upon
which
he
will
declaim
by
the
hour
together
with
much
heat
and
fury
not
that
he
has
any
particular
information
on
the
subject
but
because
he
knows
that
the
constitution
is
somehow
church
and
state
and
church
and
state
somehow
the
constitution
and
that
the
fellows
on
the
other
side
say
it
isn
t
which
is
quite
a
sufficient
reason
for
him
to
say
it
is
and
to
stick
to
it
perhaps
his
greatest
topic
of
all
though
is
the
people
if
a
fight
takes
place
in
a
populous
town
in
which
many
noses
are
broken
and
a
few
windows
the
young
gentleman
throws
down
the
newspaper
with
a
triumphant
air
and
exclaims
here
s
your
precious
people
if
boys
run
across
the
course
at
race
time
when
it
ought
to
be
kept
clear
the
young
gentleman
looks
indignantly
round
and
begs
you
to
observe
the
conduct
of
the
people
if
the
gallery
demand
a
hornpipe
between
the
play
and
the
afterpiece
the
same
young
gentleman
cries
no
and
shame
till
he
is
hoarse
and
then
inquires
with
a
sneer
what
you
think
of
popular
moderation
in
short
the
people
form
a
theme
for
him
and
when
the
attorney
on
the
side
of
his
candidate
dwells
upon
it
with
great
power
of
eloquence
at
election
time
as
he
never
fails
to
do
the
young
gentleman
and
his
friends
and
the
body
they
head
cheer
with
great
violence
against
other
with
whom
of
course
they
have
no
possible
connexion
in
much
the
same
manner
the
audience
at
a
theatre
never
fail
to
be
highly
amused
with
any
jokes
at
the
expense
of
the
laughing
heartily
at
some
other
public
and
never
at
themselves
if
the
political
young
gentleman
be
a
radical
he
is
usually
a
very
profound
person
indeed
having
great
store
of
theoretical
questions
to
put
to
you
with
an
infinite
variety
of
possible
cases
and
logical
deductions
therefrom
if
he
be
of
the
utilitarian
school
too
which
is
more
than
probable
he
is
particularly
pleasant
company
having
many
ingenious
remarks
to
offer
upon
the
voluntary
principle
and
various
cheerful
disquisitions
connected
with
the
population
of
the
country
the
position
of
great
britain
in
the
scale
of
nations
and
the
balance
of
power
then
he
is
exceedingly
well
versed
in
all
doctrines
of
political
economy
as
laid
down
in
the
newspapers
and
knows
a
great
many
parliamentary
speeches
by
heart
nay
he
has
a
small
stock
of
aphorisms
none
of
them
exceeding
a
couple
of
lines
in
length
which
will
settle
the
toughest
question
and
leave
you
nothing
to
say
he
gives
all
the
young
ladies
to
understand
that
miss
martineau
is
the
greatest
woman
that
ever
lived
and
when
they
praise
the
good
looks
of
hawkins
the
new
member
says
he
s
very
well
for
a
representative
all
things
considered
but
he
wants
a
little
calling
to
account
and
he
is
more
than
half
afraid
it
will
be
necessary
to
bring
him
down
on
his
knees
for
that
vote
on
the
miscellaneous
estimates
at
this
the
young
ladies
express
much
wonderment
and
say
surely
a
member
of
parliament
is
not
to
be
brought
upon
his
knees
so
easily
in
reply
to
which
the
political
young
gentleman
smiles
sternly
and
throws
out
dark
hints
regarding
the
speedy
arrival
of
that
day
when
members
of
parliament
will
be
paid
salaries
and
required
to
render
weekly
accounts
of
their
proceedings
at
which
the
young
ladies
utter
many
expressions
of
astonishment
and
incredulity
while
their
regard
the
prophecy
as
little
else
than
blasphemous
it
is
extremely
improving
and
interesting
to
hear
two
political
young
gentlemen
of
diverse
opinions
discuss
some
great
question
across
a
such
as
whether
if
the
public
were
admitted
to
westminster
abbey
for
nothing
they
would
or
would
not
convey
small
chisels
and
hammers
in
their
pockets
and
immediately
set
about
chipping
all
the
noses
off
the
statues
or
whether
if
they
once
got
into
the
tower
for
a
shilling
they
would
not
insist
upon
trying
the
crown
on
their
own
heads
and
loading
and
firing
off
all
the
small
arms
in
the
armoury
to
the
great
discomposure
of
whitechapel
and
the
minories
upon
these
and
many
other
momentous
questions
which
agitate
the
public
mind
in
these
desperate
days
they
will
discourse
with
great
vehemence
and
irritation
for
a
considerable
time
together
both
leaving
off
precisely
where
they
began
and
each
thoroughly
persuaded
that
he
has
got
the
better
of
the
other
in
society
at
assemblies
balls
and
playhouses
these
political
young
gentlemen
are
perpetually
on
the
watch
for
a
political
allusion
or
anything
which
can
be
tortured
or
construed
into
being
one
when
thrusting
themselves
into
the
very
smallest
openings
for
their
favourite
discourse
they
fall
upon
the
unhappy
company
tooth
and
nail
they
have
recently
had
many
favourable
opportunities
of
opening
in
churches
but
as
there
the
clergyman
has
it
all
his
own
way
and
must
not
be
contradicted
whatever
politics
he
preaches
they
are
fain
to
hold
their
tongues
until
they
reach
the
outer
door
though
at
the
imminent
risk
of
bursting
in
the
effort
as
such
discussions
can
please
nobody
but
the
talkative
parties
concerned
we
hope
they
will
henceforth
take
the
hint
and
discontinue
them
otherwise
we
now
give
them
warning
that
the
ladies
have
our
advice
to
discountenance
such
talkers
altogether
the
domestic
young
gentleman
let
us
make
a
slight
sketch
of
our
amiable
friend
felix
nixon
we
are
strongly
disposed
to
think
that
if
we
put
him
in
this
place
he
will
answer
our
purpose
without
another
word
of
comment
felix
then
is
a
young
gentleman
who
lives
at
home
with
his
mother
just
within
the
office
circle
of
three
miles
from
he
wears
indiarubber
goloshes
when
the
weather
is
at
all
damp
and
always
has
a
silk
handkerchief
neatly
folded
up
in
the
pocket
of
his
to
tie
over
his
mouth
when
he
goes
home
at
night
moreover
being
rather
he
carries
spectacles
for
particular
occasions
and
has
a
weakish
tremulous
voice
of
which
he
makes
great
use
for
he
talks
as
much
as
any
old
lady
breathing
the
two
chief
subjects
of
felix
s
discourse
are
himself
and
his
mother
both
of
whom
would
appear
to
be
very
wonderful
and
interesting
persons
as
felix
and
his
mother
are
seldom
apart
in
body
so
felix
and
his
mother
are
scarcely
ever
separate
in
spirit
if
you
ask
felix
how
he
finds
himself
he
prefaces
his
reply
with
a
long
and
minute
bulletin
of
his
mother
s
state
of
health
and
the
good
lady
in
her
turn
edifies
her
acquaintance
with
a
circumstantial
and
alarming
account
how
he
sneezed
four
times
and
coughed
once
after
being
out
in
the
rain
the
other
night
but
having
his
feet
promptly
put
into
hot
water
and
his
head
into
a
which
we
will
not
describe
more
particularly
than
by
this
delicate
allusion
was
happily
brought
round
by
the
next
morning
and
enabled
to
go
to
business
as
usual
our
friend
is
not
a
very
adventurous
or
person
but
he
has
passed
through
many
dangers
as
his
mother
can
testify
there
is
one
great
story
in
particular
concerning
a
hackney
coachman
who
wanted
to
overcharge
him
one
night
for
bringing
them
home
from
the
play
upon
which
felix
gave
the
aforesaid
coachman
a
look
which
his
mother
thought
would
have
crushed
him
to
the
earth
but
which
did
not
crush
him
quite
for
he
continued
to
demand
another
sixpence
notwithstanding
that
felix
took
out
his
and
with
the
aid
of
a
flat
candle
pointed
out
the
fare
in
print
which
the
coachman
obstinately
disregarding
he
shut
the
with
a
slam
which
his
mother
shudders
to
think
of
and
then
roused
to
the
most
appalling
pitch
of
passion
by
the
coachman
knocking
a
double
knock
to
show
that
he
was
by
no
means
convinced
he
broke
with
uncontrollable
force
from
his
parent
and
the
servant
girl
and
running
into
the
street
without
his
hat
actually
shook
his
fist
at
the
coachman
and
came
back
again
with
a
face
as
white
nixon
says
looking
about
her
for
a
simile
as
white
as
that
ceiling
she
never
will
forget
his
fury
that
night
never
to
this
account
felix
listens
with
a
solemn
face
occasionally
looking
at
you
to
see
how
it
affects
you
and
when
his
mother
has
made
an
end
of
it
adds
that
he
looked
at
every
coachman
he
met
for
three
weeks
afterwards
in
hopes
that
he
might
see
the
scoundrel
whereupon
nixon
with
an
exclamation
of
terror
requests
to
know
what
he
would
have
done
to
him
if
he
seen
him
at
which
felix
smiling
darkly
and
clenching
his
right
fist
she
exclaims
goodness
gracious
with
a
distracted
air
and
insists
upon
extorting
a
promise
that
he
never
will
on
any
account
do
anything
so
rash
which
her
dutiful
being
something
more
than
three
years
since
the
offence
was
concedes
and
his
mother
shaking
her
head
prophetically
fears
with
a
sigh
that
his
spirit
will
lead
him
into
something
violent
yet
the
discourse
then
by
an
easy
transition
turns
upon
the
spirit
which
glows
within
the
bosom
of
felix
upon
which
point
felix
himself
becomes
eloquent
and
relates
a
thrilling
anecdote
of
the
time
when
he
used
to
sit
up
till
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
reading
french
and
how
his
mother
used
to
say
felix
you
will
make
yourself
ill
i
know
you
will
and
how
used
to
say
mother
i
don
t
will
do
it
and
how
at
last
his
mother
privately
procured
a
doctor
to
come
and
see
him
who
declared
the
moment
he
felt
his
pulse
that
if
he
had
gone
on
reading
one
night
one
night
must
have
put
a
blister
on
each
temple
and
another
between
his
shoulders
and
who
as
it
was
sat
down
upon
the
instant
and
writing
a
prescription
for
a
blue
pill
said
it
must
be
taken
immediately
or
he
wouldn
t
answer
for
the
consequences
the
recital
of
these
and
many
other
moving
perils
of
the
like
nature
constantly
harrows
up
the
feelings
of
nixon
s
friends
picture
the
domestic
young
gentleman
nixon
has
a
tolerably
extensive
circle
of
female
acquaintance
being
a
talkative
bustling
little
body
and
to
the
unmarried
girls
among
them
she
is
constantly
vaunting
the
virtues
of
her
son
hinting
that
she
will
be
a
very
happy
person
who
wins
him
but
that
they
must
mind
their
p
s
and
q
s
for
he
is
very
particular
and
terribly
severe
upon
young
ladies
at
this
last
caution
the
young
ladies
resident
in
the
same
row
who
happen
to
be
spending
the
evening
there
put
their
before
their
mouths
and
are
troubled
with
a
short
cough
just
then
felix
knocks
at
the
door
and
his
mother
drawing
the
nearer
the
fire
calls
out
to
him
as
he
takes
off
his
boots
in
the
back
parlour
that
he
needn
t
mind
coming
in
in
his
slippers
for
there
are
only
the
two
miss
greys
and
miss
thompson
and
she
is
quite
sure
they
will
excuse
and
nodding
to
the
two
miss
greys
she
adds
in
a
whisper
that
julia
thompson
is
a
great
favourite
with
felix
at
which
intelligence
the
short
cough
comes
again
and
miss
thompson
in
particular
is
greatly
troubled
with
it
till
felix
coming
in
very
faint
for
want
of
his
tea
changes
the
subject
of
discourse
and
enables
her
to
laugh
out
boldly
and
tell
amelia
grey
not
to
be
so
foolish
here
they
all
three
laugh
and
nixon
says
they
are
giddy
girls
in
which
stage
of
the
proceedings
felix
who
has
by
this
time
refreshened
himself
with
the
grateful
herb
that
cheers
but
not
inebriates
removes
his
cup
from
his
countenance
and
says
with
a
knowing
smile
that
all
girls
are
whereat
his
admiring
mamma
pats
him
on
the
back
and
tells
him
not
to
be
sly
which
calls
forth
a
general
laugh
from
the
young
ladies
and
another
smile
from
felix
who
thinking
he
looks
very
sly
indeed
is
perfectly
satisfied
tea
being
over
the
young
ladies
resume
their
work
and
felix
insists
upon
holding
a
skein
of
silk
while
miss
thompson
winds
it
on
a
card
this
process
having
been
performed
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
he
brings
down
his
flute
in
compliance
with
a
request
from
the
youngest
miss
grey
and
plays
divers
tunes
out
of
a
very
small
till
when
he
is
very
facetious
and
talkative
indeed
finally
after
half
a
tumblerful
of
warm
sherry
and
water
he
gallantly
puts
on
his
goloshes
over
his
slippers
and
telling
miss
thompson
s
servant
to
run
on
first
and
get
the
door
open
escorts
that
young
lady
to
her
house
five
doors
off
the
miss
greys
who
live
in
the
next
house
but
one
stopping
to
peep
with
merry
faces
from
their
own
door
till
he
comes
back
again
when
they
call
out
very
well
felix
and
trip
into
the
passage
with
a
laugh
more
musical
than
any
flute
that
was
ever
played
felix
is
rather
prim
in
his
appearance
and
perhaps
a
little
priggish
about
his
books
and
flute
and
so
forth
which
have
all
their
peculiar
corners
of
peculiar
shelves
in
his
bedroom
indeed
all
his
female
acquaintance
and
they
are
good
judges
have
long
ago
set
him
down
as
a
thorough
old
bachelor
he
is
a
favourite
with
them
however
in
a
certain
way
as
an
honest
inoffensive
creature
and
as
his
peculiarities
harm
nobody
not
even
himself
we
are
induced
to
hope
that
many
who
are
not
personally
acquainted
with
him
will
take
our
good
word
in
his
behalf
and
be
content
to
leave
him
to
a
long
continuance
of
his
harmless
existence
the
censorious
young
gentleman
there
is
an
amiable
kind
of
young
gentleman
going
about
in
society
upon
whom
after
much
experience
of
him
and
considerable
turning
over
of
the
subject
in
our
mind
we
feel
it
our
duty
to
affix
the
above
appellation
young
ladies
mildly
call
him
a
sarcastic
young
gentleman
or
a
severe
young
gentleman
we
who
know
better
beg
to
acquaint
them
with
the
fact
that
he
is
merely
a
censorious
young
gentleman
and
nothing
else
the
censorious
young
gentleman
has
the
reputation
among
his
familiars
of
a
remarkably
clever
person
which
he
maintains
by
receiving
all
intelligence
and
expressing
all
opinions
with
a
dubious
sneer
accompanied
with
a
half
smile
expressive
of
anything
you
please
but
this
sets
people
about
thinking
what
on
earth
the
censorious
young
gentleman
means
and
they
speedily
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
he
means
something
very
deep
indeed
for
they
reason
in
this
this
young
gentleman
looks
so
very
knowing
that
he
must
mean
something
and
as
i
am
by
no
means
a
dull
individual
what
a
very
deep
meaning
he
must
have
if
i
can
t
find
it
out
it
is
extraordinary
how
soon
a
censorious
young
gentleman
may
make
a
reputation
in
his
own
small
circle
if
he
bear
this
in
his
mind
and
regulate
his
proceedings
accordingly
as
young
ladies
are
curious
but
laudably
desirous
to
acquire
information
the
censorious
young
gentleman
is
much
talked
about
among
them
and
many
surmises
are
hazarded
regarding
him
i
wonder
exclaims
the
eldest
miss
greenwood
laying
down
her
work
to
turn
up
the
lamp
i
wonder
whether
fairfax
will
ever
be
bless
me
dear
cries
miss
marshall
what
ever
made
you
think
of
him
really
i
hardly
know
replies
miss
greenwood
he
is
such
a
very
mysterious
person
that
i
often
wonder
about
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
replies
miss
marshall
and
so
do
here
two
other
young
ladies
profess
that
they
are
constantly
doing
the
like
and
all
present
appear
in
the
same
condition
except
one
young
lady
who
not
scrupling
to
state
that
she
considers
fairfax
a
horror
draws
down
all
the
opposition
of
the
others
which
having
been
expressed
in
a
great
many
ejaculatory
passages
such
as
well
did
i
ever
lor
emily
dear
ma
takes
up
the
subject
and
gravely
states
that
she
must
say
she
does
not
think
fairfax
by
any
means
a
horror
but
rather
takes
him
to
be
a
young
man
of
very
great
ability
and
i
am
quite
sure
adds
the
worthy
lady
he
always
means
a
great
deal
more
than
he
the
door
opens
at
this
point
of
the
disclosure
and
who
of
all
people
alive
walks
into
the
room
but
the
very
fairfax
who
has
been
the
subject
of
conversation
well
it
really
is
curious
cries
ma
we
were
at
that
very
moment
talking
about
you
did
me
great
honour
replies
fairfax
may
i
venture
to
ask
what
you
were
saying
why
if
you
must
know
returns
the
eldest
girl
we
were
remarking
what
a
very
mysterious
man
you
ay
ay
observes
fairfax
indeed
now
fairfax
says
this
ay
ay
and
indeed
which
are
slight
words
enough
in
themselves
with
so
very
unfathomable
an
air
and
accompanies
them
with
such
a
very
equivocal
smile
that
ma
and
the
young
ladies
are
more
than
ever
convinced
that
he
means
an
immensity
and
so
tell
him
he
is
a
very
dangerous
man
and
seems
to
be
always
thinking
ill
of
somebody
which
is
precisely
the
sort
of
character
the
censorious
young
gentleman
is
most
desirous
to
establish
wherefore
he
says
oh
dear
no
in
a
tone
obviously
intended
to
mean
you
have
me
there
and
which
gives
them
to
understand
that
they
have
hit
the
right
nail
on
the
very
centre
of
its
head
when
the
conversation
ranges
from
the
mystery
overhanging
the
censorious
young
gentleman
s
behaviour
to
the
general
topics
of
the
day
he
sustains
his
character
to
admiration
he
considers
the
new
tragedy
well
enough
for
a
new
tragedy
but
lord
bless
no
matter
he
could
say
a
great
deal
on
that
point
but
he
would
rather
not
lest
he
should
be
thought
as
he
knows
he
would
be
but
is
not
s
performance
truly
charming
inquires
a
young
lady
charming
replies
the
censorious
young
gentleman
oh
dear
yes
certainly
very
very
charming
after
this
he
stirs
the
fire
smiling
contemptuously
all
the
while
and
a
modest
young
gentleman
who
has
been
a
silent
listener
thinks
what
a
great
thing
it
must
be
to
have
such
a
critical
judgment
of
music
pictures
books
and
poetry
the
censorious
young
gentleman
has
an
equally
fine
conception
as
to
men
and
women
he
can
tell
all
about
them
at
a
glance
now
let
us
hear
your
opinion
of
young
barker
says
some
great
believer
in
the
powers
of
fairfax
but
don
t
be
too
i
never
am
severe
replies
the
censorious
young
gentleman
well
never
mind
that
now
she
is
very
is
she
not
repeats
the
censorious
young
gentleman
for
he
always
repeats
when
he
is
at
a
loss
for
anything
to
say
did
you
observe
her
manner
bless
my
heart
and
soul
thompson
did
you
observe
her
manner
s
all
i
i
thought
i
had
done
so
rejoins
the
poor
lady
much
perplexed
i
did
not
observe
it
very
closely
oh
not
very
closely
rejoins
the
censorious
young
gentleman
triumphantly
very
good
then
did
let
us
talk
no
more
about
the
censorious
young
gentleman
purses
up
his
lips
and
nods
his
head
sagely
as
he
says
this
and
it
is
forthwith
whispered
about
that
fairfax
who
though
he
is
a
little
prejudiced
must
be
admitted
to
be
a
very
excellent
judge
has
observed
something
exceedingly
odd
in
barker
s
manner
the
funny
young
gentleman
as
one
funny
young
gentleman
will
serve
as
a
sample
of
all
funny
young
gentlemen
we
purpose
merely
to
note
down
the
conduct
and
behaviour
of
an
individual
specimen
of
this
class
whom
we
happened
to
meet
at
an
annual
family
christmas
party
in
the
course
of
this
very
last
christmas
that
ever
came
we
were
all
seated
round
a
blazing
fire
which
crackled
pleasantly
as
the
guests
talked
merrily
and
the
urn
steamed
being
an
party
there
an
urn
and
a
teapot
there
came
a
postman
s
knock
at
the
door
so
violent
and
sudden
that
it
startled
the
whole
circle
and
actually
caused
two
or
three
very
interesting
and
most
unaffected
young
ladies
to
scream
aloud
and
to
exhibit
many
afflicting
symptoms
of
terror
and
distress
until
they
had
been
several
times
assured
by
their
respective
adorers
that
they
were
in
no
danger
we
were
about
to
remark
that
it
was
surely
beyond
and
must
have
been
a
runaway
knock
when
our
host
who
had
hitherto
been
paralysed
with
wonder
sank
into
a
chair
in
a
perfect
ecstasy
of
laughter
and
offered
to
lay
twenty
pounds
that
it
was
that
droll
dog
griggins
he
had
no
sooner
said
this
than
the
majority
of
the
company
and
all
the
children
of
the
house
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
too
as
if
some
inimitable
joke
flashed
upon
them
simultaneously
and
gave
vent
to
various
exclamations
be
sure
it
must
be
griggins
and
how
like
him
that
was
and
what
spirits
he
was
always
in
with
many
other
commendatory
remarks
of
the
like
nature
not
having
the
happiness
to
know
griggins
we
became
extremely
desirous
to
see
so
pleasant
a
fellow
the
more
especially
as
a
stout
gentleman
with
a
powdered
head
who
was
sitting
with
his
breeches
buckles
almost
touching
the
hob
whispered
us
he
was
a
wit
of
the
first
water
when
the
door
opened
and
griggins
being
announced
presented
himself
amidst
another
shout
of
laughter
and
a
loud
clapping
of
hands
from
the
younger
branches
this
welcome
he
acknowledged
by
sundry
contortions
of
countenance
imitative
of
the
clown
in
one
of
the
new
pantomimes
which
were
so
extremely
successful
that
one
stout
gentleman
rolled
upon
an
ottoman
in
a
paroxysm
of
delight
protesting
with
many
gasps
that
if
somebody
didn
t
make
that
fellow
griggins
leave
off
he
would
be
the
death
of
him
he
knew
at
this
the
company
only
laughed
more
boisterously
than
before
and
as
we
always
like
to
accommodate
our
tone
and
spirit
if
possible
to
the
humour
of
any
society
in
which
we
find
ourself
we
laughed
with
the
rest
and
exclaimed
oh
capital
capital
as
loud
as
any
of
them
when
he
had
quite
exhausted
all
beholders
griggins
received
the
welcomes
and
congratulations
of
the
circle
and
went
through
the
needful
introductions
with
much
ease
and
many
puns
this
ceremony
over
he
avowed
his
intention
of
sitting
in
somebody
s
lap
unless
the
young
ladies
made
room
for
him
on
the
sofa
which
being
done
after
a
great
deal
of
tittering
and
pleasantry
he
squeezed
himself
among
them
and
likened
his
condition
to
that
of
love
among
the
roses
at
this
novel
jest
we
all
roared
once
more
you
should
consider
yourself
highly
honoured
sir
said
we
sir
replied
griggins
you
do
me
here
everybody
laughed
again
and
the
stout
gentleman
by
the
fire
whispered
in
our
ear
that
griggins
was
making
a
dead
set
at
us
the
having
been
removed
we
all
sat
down
to
a
round
game
and
here
griggins
shone
forth
with
peculiar
brilliancy
abstracting
other
people
s
fish
and
looking
over
their
hands
in
the
most
comical
manner
he
made
one
most
excellent
joke
in
snuffing
a
candle
which
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
setting
fire
to
the
hair
of
a
pale
young
gentleman
who
sat
next
him
and
afterwards
begging
his
pardon
with
considerable
humour
as
the
young
gentleman
could
not
see
the
joke
however
possibly
in
consequence
of
its
being
on
the
top
of
his
own
head
it
did
not
go
off
quite
as
well
as
it
might
have
done
indeed
the
young
gentleman
was
heard
to
murmur
some
general
references
to
impertinence
and
a
rascal
and
to
state
the
number
of
his
lodgings
in
an
angry
turn
of
the
conversation
which
might
have
been
productive
of
slaughterous
consequences
if
a
young
lady
betrothed
to
the
young
gentleman
had
not
used
her
immediate
influence
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
emphatically
declaring
in
an
agitated
whisper
intended
for
his
peculiar
edification
but
audible
to
the
whole
table
that
if
he
went
on
in
that
way
she
never
would
think
of
him
otherwise
than
as
a
friend
though
as
that
she
must
always
regard
him
at
this
terrible
threat
the
young
gentleman
became
calm
and
the
young
lady
overcome
by
the
revulsion
of
feeling
instantaneously
fainted
picture
the
funny
young
gentleman
griggins
s
spirits
were
slightly
depressed
for
a
short
period
by
this
result
of
such
a
harmless
pleasantry
but
being
promptly
elevated
by
the
attentions
of
the
host
and
several
glasses
of
wine
he
soon
recovered
and
became
even
more
vivacious
than
before
insomuch
that
the
stout
gentleman
previously
referred
to
assured
us
that
although
he
had
known
him
since
he
was
high
something
smaller
than
a
he
had
never
beheld
him
in
such
excellent
cue
when
the
round
game
and
several
games
at
blind
man
s
buff
which
followed
it
were
all
over
and
we
were
going
down
to
supper
the
inexhaustible
griggins
produced
a
small
sprig
of
mistletoe
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
commenced
a
general
kissing
of
the
assembled
females
which
occasioned
great
commotion
and
much
excitement
we
observed
that
several
young
the
young
gentleman
with
the
pale
greatly
scandalised
at
this
indecorous
proceeding
and
talked
very
big
among
themselves
in
corners
and
we
observed
too
that
several
young
ladies
when
remonstrated
with
by
the
aforesaid
young
gentlemen
called
each
other
to
witness
how
they
had
struggled
and
protested
vehemently
that
it
was
very
rude
and
that
they
were
surprised
at
brown
s
allowing
it
and
that
they
couldn
t
bear
it
and
had
no
patience
with
such
impertinence
but
such
is
the
gentle
and
forgiving
nature
of
woman
that
although
we
looked
very
narrowly
for
it
we
could
not
detect
the
slightest
harshness
in
the
subsequent
treatment
of
griggins
indeed
upon
the
whole
it
struck
us
that
among
the
ladies
he
seemed
rather
more
popular
than
before
to
recount
all
the
drollery
of
griggins
at
supper
would
fill
such
a
tiny
volume
as
this
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
outside
cover
how
he
drank
out
of
other
people
s
glasses
and
ate
of
other
people
s
bread
how
he
frightened
into
screaming
convulsions
a
little
boy
who
was
sitting
up
to
supper
in
a
high
chair
by
sinking
below
the
table
and
suddenly
reappearing
with
a
mask
on
how
the
hostess
was
really
surprised
that
anybody
could
find
a
pleasure
in
tormenting
children
and
how
the
host
frowned
at
the
hostess
and
felt
convinced
that
griggins
had
done
it
with
the
very
best
intentions
how
griggins
explained
and
how
everybody
s
was
restored
but
the
child
s
tell
these
and
a
hundred
other
things
ever
so
briefly
would
occupy
more
of
our
room
and
our
readers
patience
than
either
they
or
we
can
conveniently
spare
therefore
we
change
the
subject
merely
observing
that
we
have
offered
no
description
of
the
funny
young
gentleman
s
personal
appearance
believing
that
almost
every
society
has
a
griggins
of
its
own
and
leaving
all
readers
to
supply
the
deficiency
according
to
the
particular
circumstances
of
their
particular
case
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
all
gentlemen
who
love
the
there
are
few
gentlemen
who
are
not
attached
to
the
most
intellectual
and
rational
of
all
our
not
come
within
this
definition
as
we
have
no
mean
relish
for
theatrical
entertainments
ourself
we
are
disinterestedly
anxious
that
this
should
be
perfectly
understood
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
has
early
and
important
information
on
all
theatrical
topics
well
says
he
abruptly
when
you
meet
him
in
the
street
here
s
a
pretty
flimkins
has
thrown
up
his
part
in
the
melodrama
at
the
and
what
s
to
be
done
you
inquire
with
as
much
gravity
as
you
can
counterfeit
ah
that
s
the
point
replies
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
looking
very
serious
boozle
declines
it
positively
declines
it
from
all
i
am
told
i
should
say
it
was
decidedly
in
boozle
s
line
and
that
he
would
be
very
likely
to
make
a
great
hit
in
it
but
he
objects
on
the
ground
of
flimkins
having
been
put
up
in
the
part
first
and
says
no
earthly
power
shall
induce
him
to
take
the
character
it
s
a
fine
part
business
i
m
told
he
has
to
kill
six
people
in
the
course
of
the
piece
and
to
fight
over
a
bridge
in
red
fire
which
is
as
safe
a
card
you
know
as
can
be
don
t
mention
it
but
i
hear
that
the
last
scene
when
he
is
first
poisoned
and
then
stabbed
by
flimkins
as
vengedora
will
be
the
greatest
thing
that
has
been
done
these
many
with
this
piece
of
news
and
laying
his
finger
on
his
lips
as
a
caution
for
you
not
to
excite
the
town
with
it
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
hurries
away
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
from
often
frequenting
the
different
theatrical
establishments
has
pet
and
familiar
names
for
them
all
thus
is
the
garden
the
lane
the
victoria
the
vic
and
the
olympic
the
pic
actresses
too
are
always
designated
by
their
surnames
only
as
taylor
nisbett
faucit
honey
that
talented
and
girl
sheriff
that
clever
little
creature
horton
and
so
on
in
the
same
manner
he
prefixes
christian
names
when
he
mentions
actors
as
charley
young
jemmy
buckstone
fred
yates
paul
bedford
when
he
is
at
a
loss
for
a
christian
name
the
word
old
applied
indiscriminately
answers
quite
as
well
as
old
charley
matthews
at
vestris
s
old
harley
and
old
braham
he
has
a
great
knowledge
of
the
private
proceedings
of
actresses
especially
of
their
getting
married
and
can
tell
you
in
a
breath
who
have
changed
their
names
without
avowing
it
whenever
an
alteration
of
this
kind
is
made
in
the
playbills
he
will
remind
you
that
he
let
you
into
the
secret
six
months
ago
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
has
a
great
reverence
for
all
that
is
connected
with
the
stage
department
of
the
different
theatres
he
would
at
any
time
prefer
going
a
street
or
two
out
of
his
way
to
omitting
to
pass
a
into
which
he
always
looks
with
a
curious
and
searching
eye
if
he
can
only
identify
a
popular
actor
in
the
street
he
is
in
a
perfect
transport
of
delight
and
no
sooner
meets
him
than
he
hurries
back
and
walks
a
few
paces
in
front
of
him
so
that
he
can
turn
round
from
time
to
time
and
have
a
good
stare
at
his
features
he
looks
upon
a
dinner
as
one
of
the
most
enchanting
festivities
ever
known
and
thinks
that
to
be
a
member
of
the
garrick
club
and
see
so
many
actors
in
their
plain
clothes
must
be
one
of
the
highest
gratifications
the
world
can
bestow
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
is
a
constant
visitor
at
one
or
other
of
the
theatres
and
has
an
infinite
relish
for
all
pieces
which
display
the
fullest
resources
of
the
establishment
he
likes
to
place
implicit
reliance
upon
the
when
he
goes
to
see
a
and
works
himself
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
as
not
only
to
believe
if
the
bills
say
so
that
there
are
three
hundred
and
people
on
the
stage
at
one
time
in
the
last
scene
but
is
highly
indignant
with
you
unless
you
believe
it
also
he
considers
that
if
the
stage
be
opened
from
the
to
the
back
wall
in
any
new
play
the
piece
is
a
triumph
of
dramatic
writing
and
applauds
accordingly
he
has
a
great
notion
of
too
and
thinks
any
character
going
down
or
coming
up
a
trap
no
matter
whether
he
be
an
angel
or
a
both
do
it
occasionally
one
of
the
most
interesting
feats
in
the
whole
range
of
scenic
illusion
besides
these
acquirements
he
has
several
veracious
accounts
to
communicate
of
the
private
manners
and
customs
of
different
actors
which
during
the
pauses
of
a
quadrille
he
usually
communicates
to
his
partner
or
imparts
to
his
neighbour
at
a
supper
table
thus
he
is
advised
that
liston
always
had
a
footman
in
gorgeous
livery
waiting
at
the
with
a
brandy
bottle
and
tumbler
to
administer
half
a
pint
or
so
of
spirit
to
him
every
time
he
came
off
without
which
assistance
he
must
infallibly
have
fainted
he
knows
for
a
fact
that
after
an
arduous
part
george
bennett
is
put
between
two
feather
beds
to
absorb
the
perspiration
and
is
credibly
informed
that
baker
has
for
many
years
submitted
to
a
course
of
lukewarm
to
qualify
him
to
sustain
his
favourite
characters
he
looks
upon
fitz
ball
as
the
principal
dramatic
genius
and
poet
of
the
day
but
holds
that
there
are
great
writers
extant
besides
him
proof
whereof
he
refers
you
to
various
dramas
and
melodramas
recently
produced
of
which
he
takes
in
all
the
sixpenny
and
editions
as
fast
as
they
appear
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
is
a
great
advocate
for
violence
of
emotion
and
redundancy
of
action
if
a
father
has
to
curse
a
child
upon
the
stage
he
likes
to
see
it
done
in
the
style
with
no
mistake
about
it
to
which
end
it
is
essential
that
the
child
should
follow
the
father
on
her
knees
and
be
knocked
violently
over
on
her
face
by
the
old
gentleman
as
he
goes
into
a
small
cottage
and
shuts
the
door
behind
him
he
likes
to
see
a
blessing
invoked
upon
the
young
lady
when
the
old
gentleman
repents
with
equal
earnestness
and
accompanied
by
the
usual
conventional
forms
which
consist
of
the
old
gentleman
looking
anxiously
up
into
the
clouds
as
if
to
see
whether
it
rains
and
then
spreading
an
imaginary
tablecloth
in
the
air
over
the
young
lady
s
music
playing
all
the
while
upon
these
and
other
points
of
a
similar
kind
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
is
a
great
critic
indeed
he
is
likewise
very
acute
in
judging
of
natural
expressions
of
the
passions
and
knows
precisely
the
frown
wink
nod
or
leer
which
stands
for
any
one
of
them
or
the
means
by
which
it
may
be
converted
into
any
other
as
jealousy
with
a
good
stamp
of
the
right
foot
becomes
anger
or
wildness
with
the
hands
clasped
before
the
throat
instead
of
tearing
the
wig
is
passionate
love
if
you
venture
to
express
a
doubt
of
the
accuracy
of
any
of
these
portraitures
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
assures
you
with
a
haughty
smile
that
it
always
has
been
done
in
that
way
and
he
supposes
they
are
not
going
to
change
it
at
this
time
of
day
to
please
you
to
which
of
course
you
meekly
reply
that
you
suppose
not
there
are
innumerable
disquisitions
of
this
nature
in
which
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
is
very
profound
especially
to
ladies
whom
he
is
most
in
the
habit
of
entertaining
with
them
but
as
we
have
no
space
to
recapitulate
them
at
greater
length
we
must
rest
content
with
calling
the
attention
of
the
young
ladies
in
general
to
the
theatrical
young
gentlemen
of
their
own
acquaintance
the
poetical
young
gentleman
time
was
and
not
very
long
ago
either
when
a
singular
epidemic
raged
among
the
young
gentlemen
vast
numbers
of
whom
under
the
influence
of
the
malady
tore
off
their
neckerchiefs
turned
down
their
shirt
collars
and
exhibited
themselves
in
the
open
streets
with
bare
throats
and
dejected
countenances
before
the
eyes
of
an
astonished
public
these
were
poetical
young
gentlemen
the
custom
was
gradually
found
to
be
inconvenient
as
involving
the
necessity
of
too
much
clean
linen
and
too
large
washing
bills
and
these
outward
symptoms
have
consequently
passed
away
but
we
are
disposed
to
think
notwithstanding
that
the
number
of
poetical
young
gentlemen
is
considerably
on
the
increase
we
know
a
poetical
young
very
poetical
young
gentleman
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
is
troubled
with
the
gift
of
poesy
in
any
remarkable
degree
but
his
countenance
is
of
a
plaintive
and
melancholy
cast
his
manner
is
abstracted
and
bespeaks
affliction
of
soul
he
seldom
has
his
hair
cut
and
often
talks
about
being
an
outcast
and
wanting
a
kindred
spirit
from
which
as
well
as
from
many
general
observations
in
which
he
is
wont
to
indulge
concerning
mysterious
impulses
and
yearnings
of
the
heart
and
the
supremacy
of
intellect
gilding
all
earthly
things
with
the
glowing
magic
of
immortal
verse
it
is
clear
to
all
his
friends
that
he
has
been
stricken
poetical
the
favourite
attitude
of
the
poetical
young
gentleman
is
lounging
on
a
sofa
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ceiling
or
sitting
bolt
upright
in
a
chair
staring
with
very
round
eyes
at
the
opposite
wall
when
he
is
in
one
of
these
positions
his
mother
who
is
a
worthy
affectionate
old
soul
will
give
you
a
nudge
to
bespeak
your
attention
without
disturbing
the
abstracted
one
and
whisper
with
a
shake
of
the
head
that
john
s
imagination
is
at
some
extraordinary
work
or
other
you
may
take
her
word
for
it
hereupon
john
looks
more
fiercely
intent
upon
vacancy
than
before
and
suddenly
snatching
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
puts
down
three
words
and
a
cross
on
the
back
of
a
card
sighs
deeply
paces
once
or
twice
across
the
room
inflicts
a
most
unmerciful
slap
upon
his
head
and
walks
moodily
up
to
his
dormitory
the
poetical
young
gentleman
is
apt
to
acquire
peculiar
notions
of
things
too
which
plain
ordinary
people
unblessed
with
a
poetical
obliquity
of
vision
would
suppose
to
be
rather
distorted
for
instance
when
the
sickening
murder
and
mangling
of
a
wretched
woman
was
affording
delicious
food
wherewithal
to
gorge
the
insatiable
curiosity
of
the
public
our
friend
the
poetical
young
gentleman
was
in
of
disgust
but
admiration
heavens
cried
the
poetical
young
gentleman
how
grand
how
great
we
ventured
deferentially
to
inquire
upon
whom
these
epithets
were
bestowed
our
humble
thoughts
oscillating
between
the
police
officer
who
found
the
criminal
and
the
who
found
the
head
upon
whom
exclaimed
the
poetical
young
gentleman
in
a
frenzy
of
poetry
upon
whom
should
they
be
bestowed
but
upon
the
murderer
thereupon
it
came
out
in
a
fine
torrent
of
eloquence
that
the
murderer
was
a
great
spirit
a
bold
creature
full
of
daring
and
nerve
a
man
of
dauntless
heart
and
determined
courage
and
withal
a
great
casuist
and
able
reasoner
as
was
fully
demonstrated
in
his
philosophical
colloquies
with
the
great
and
noble
of
the
land
we
held
our
peace
and
meekly
signified
our
indisposition
to
controvert
these
because
we
were
no
match
at
quotation
for
the
poetical
young
gentleman
and
secondly
because
we
felt
it
would
be
of
little
use
our
entering
into
any
disputation
if
we
were
being
perfectly
convinced
that
the
respectable
and
immoral
hero
in
question
is
not
the
first
and
will
not
be
the
last
hanged
gentleman
upon
whom
false
sympathy
or
diseased
curiosity
will
be
plentifully
expended
this
was
a
stern
mystic
flight
of
the
poetical
young
gentleman
in
his
milder
and
softer
moments
he
occasionally
lays
down
his
neckcloth
and
pens
stanzas
which
sometimes
find
their
way
into
a
lady
s
magazine
or
the
poets
corner
of
some
country
newspaper
or
which
in
default
of
either
vent
for
his
genius
adorn
the
rainbow
leaves
of
a
lady
s
album
these
are
generally
written
upon
some
such
occasions
as
contemplating
the
bank
of
england
by
midnight
or
beholding
saint
paul
s
in
a
and
when
these
gloomy
objects
fail
to
afford
him
inspiration
he
pours
forth
his
soul
in
a
touching
address
to
a
violet
or
a
plaintive
lament
that
he
is
no
longer
a
child
but
has
gradually
grown
up
picture
the
poetical
young
gentleman
the
poetical
young
gentleman
is
fond
of
quoting
passages
from
his
favourite
authors
who
are
all
of
the
gloomy
and
desponding
school
he
has
a
great
deal
to
say
too
about
the
world
and
is
much
given
to
opining
especially
if
he
has
taken
anything
strong
to
drink
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
worth
living
for
he
gives
you
to
understand
however
that
for
the
sake
of
society
he
means
to
bear
his
part
in
the
tiresome
play
manfully
resisting
the
gratification
of
his
own
strong
desire
to
make
a
premature
exit
and
consoles
himself
with
the
reflection
that
immortality
has
some
chosen
nook
for
himself
and
the
other
great
spirits
whom
earth
has
chafed
and
wearied
when
the
poetical
young
gentleman
makes
use
of
adjectives
they
are
all
superlatives
everything
is
of
the
grandest
greatest
noblest
mightiest
loftiest
or
the
lowest
meanest
obscurest
vilest
and
most
pitiful
he
knows
no
medium
for
enthusiasm
is
the
soul
of
poetry
and
who
so
enthusiastic
as
a
poetical
young
gentleman
mr
milkwash
says
a
young
lady
as
she
unlocks
her
album
to
receive
the
young
gentleman
s
original
impromptu
contribution
how
very
silent
you
are
i
think
you
must
be
in
love
cries
the
poetical
young
gentleman
starting
from
his
seat
by
the
fire
and
terrifying
the
cat
who
scampers
off
at
full
speed
love
that
burning
consuming
passion
that
ardour
of
the
soul
that
fierce
glowing
of
the
heart
love
the
withering
blighting
influence
of
hope
misplaced
and
affection
slighted
love
did
you
say
ha
ha
ha
with
this
the
poetical
young
gentleman
laughs
a
laugh
belonging
only
to
poets
and
smith
of
the
adelphi
theatre
and
sits
down
pen
in
hand
to
throw
off
a
page
or
two
of
verse
in
the
biting
demoniac
style
which
like
the
poetical
young
gentleman
himself
is
full
of
sound
and
fury
signifying
nothing
the
young
gentleman
there
is
a
certain
kind
of
bragging
vaunting
puffing
young
whom
we
are
desirous
to
warn
that
fairer
part
of
the
creation
to
whom
we
more
peculiarly
devote
these
our
labours
and
we
are
particularly
induced
to
lay
especial
stress
upon
this
division
of
our
subject
by
a
little
dialogue
we
held
some
short
time
ago
with
an
esteemed
young
lady
of
our
acquaintance
touching
a
most
gross
specimen
of
this
class
of
men
we
had
been
urging
all
the
absurdities
of
his
conduct
and
conversation
and
dwelling
upon
the
impossibilities
he
constantly
which
indeed
we
had
not
scrupled
to
prefix
a
certain
hard
little
word
of
one
syllable
and
three
our
fair
friend
unable
to
maintain
the
contest
any
longer
reluctantly
cried
well
he
certainly
has
a
habit
of
but
what
then
throw
him
off
yourself
said
we
and
so
she
did
but
not
at
our
instance
for
other
reasons
appeared
and
it
might
have
been
better
if
she
had
done
so
at
first
the
young
gentleman
has
so
often
a
father
possessed
of
vast
property
in
some
remote
district
of
ireland
that
we
look
with
some
suspicion
upon
all
young
gentlemen
who
volunteer
this
description
of
themselves
the
deceased
grandfather
of
the
young
gentleman
was
a
man
of
immense
possessions
and
untold
wealth
the
young
gentleman
remembers
as
well
as
if
it
were
only
yesterday
the
deceased
baronet
s
library
with
its
long
rows
of
scarce
and
valuable
books
in
superbly
embossed
bindings
arranged
in
cases
reaching
from
the
lofty
ceiling
to
the
oaken
floor
and
the
fine
antique
chairs
and
tables
and
the
noble
old
castle
of
ballykillbabaloo
with
its
splendid
prospect
of
hill
and
dale
and
wood
and
rich
wild
scenery
and
the
fine
hunting
stables
and
the
spacious
upon
the
same
magnificent
scale
says
the
young
gentleman
princely
quite
princely
ah
and
he
sighs
as
if
mourning
over
the
fallen
fortunes
of
his
noble
house
the
young
gentleman
is
a
universal
genius
at
walking
running
rowing
swimming
and
skating
he
is
unrivalled
at
all
games
of
chance
or
skill
at
hunting
shooting
fishing
riding
driving
or
amateur
theatricals
no
one
can
touch
is
not
because
he
gives
you
carefully
to
understand
lest
there
should
be
any
opportunity
of
testing
his
skill
that
he
is
quite
out
of
practice
just
now
and
has
been
for
some
years
if
you
mention
any
beautiful
girl
of
your
common
acquaintance
in
his
hearing
the
young
gentleman
starts
smiles
and
begs
you
not
to
mind
him
for
it
was
quite
involuntary
people
do
say
indeed
that
they
were
once
engaged
but
she
is
a
very
fine
girl
he
was
so
situated
at
that
time
that
he
couldn
t
possibly
encourage
but
it
s
of
no
use
talking
about
it
he
adds
interrupting
himself
she
has
got
over
it
now
and
i
firmly
hope
and
trust
is
with
this
benevolent
aspiration
he
nods
his
head
in
a
mysterious
manner
and
whistling
the
first
part
of
some
popular
air
thinks
perhaps
it
will
be
better
to
change
the
subject
there
is
another
great
characteristic
of
the
young
gentleman
which
is
that
he
happens
to
be
acquainted
with
a
most
extraordinary
variety
of
people
in
all
parts
of
the
world
thus
in
all
disputed
questions
when
the
young
gentleman
has
no
argument
to
bring
forward
he
invariably
happens
to
be
acquainted
with
some
distant
person
intimately
connected
with
the
subject
whose
testimony
decides
the
point
against
you
to
the
we
say
the
great
admiration
of
three
young
ladies
out
of
every
four
who
consider
the
young
gentleman
a
very
young
man
and
a
most
charming
person
sometimes
the
young
gentleman
happens
to
look
in
upon
a
little
family
circle
of
young
ladies
who
are
quietly
spending
the
evening
together
and
then
indeed
is
he
at
the
very
height
and
summit
of
his
glory
for
it
is
to
be
observed
that
he
by
no
means
shines
to
equal
advantage
in
the
presence
of
men
as
in
the
society
of
young
ladies
which
is
his
proper
element
it
is
delightful
to
hear
the
number
of
pretty
things
the
young
gentleman
gives
utterance
to
during
tea
and
still
more
so
to
observe
the
ease
with
which
from
long
practice
and
study
he
delicately
blends
one
compliment
to
a
lady
with
two
for
himself
did
you
ever
see
a
more
lovely
blue
than
this
flower
caveton
asks
a
young
lady
who
truth
to
tell
is
rather
smitten
with
the
young
gentleman
never
he
replies
bending
over
the
object
of
admiration
never
but
in
your
oh
caveton
cries
the
young
lady
blushing
of
course
indeed
i
speak
the
truth
replies
the
young
gentleman
i
never
saw
any
approach
to
them
i
used
to
think
my
cousin
s
blue
eyes
lovely
but
they
grow
dim
and
colourless
beside
oh
a
beautiful
cousin
caveton
replies
the
young
lady
with
that
perfect
artlessness
which
is
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
all
young
ladies
an
affair
of
no
indeed
indeed
you
wrong
me
rejoins
the
young
gentleman
with
great
energy
i
fervently
hope
that
her
attachment
towards
me
may
be
nothing
but
the
natural
result
of
our
close
intimacy
in
childhood
and
that
in
change
of
scene
and
among
new
faces
she
may
soon
overcome
it
love
her
think
not
so
meanly
of
me
miss
lowfield
i
beseech
as
to
suppose
that
title
lands
riches
and
beauty
can
influence
choice
the
heart
the
heart
miss
here
the
young
gentleman
sinks
his
voice
to
a
still
lower
whisper
and
the
young
lady
duly
proclaims
to
all
the
other
young
ladies
when
they
go
to
put
their
bonnets
on
that
caveton
s
relations
are
all
immensely
rich
and
that
he
is
hopelessly
beloved
by
title
lands
riches
and
beauty
we
have
seen
a
young
gentleman
who
to
our
certain
knowledge
was
innocent
of
a
note
of
music
and
scarcely
able
to
recognise
a
tune
by
ear
volunteer
a
spanish
air
upon
the
guitar
when
he
had
previously
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
not
such
an
instrument
within
a
mile
of
the
house
we
have
heard
another
young
gentleman
after
striking
a
note
or
two
upon
the
piano
and
accompanying
it
correctly
by
dint
of
laborious
practice
with
his
voice
assure
a
circle
of
wondering
listeners
that
so
acute
was
his
ear
that
he
was
wholly
unable
to
sing
out
of
tune
let
him
try
as
he
would
we
have
lived
to
witness
the
unmasking
of
another
young
gentleman
who
went
out
a
visiting
in
a
military
cap
with
a
gold
band
and
tassel
and
who
after
passing
successfully
for
a
captain
and
being
lauded
to
the
skies
for
his
red
whiskers
his
bravery
his
soldierly
bearing
and
his
pride
turned
out
to
be
the
dishonest
son
of
an
honest
in
a
small
country
town
and
whom
if
it
were
not
for
this
fortunate
exposure
we
should
not
yet
despair
of
encountering
as
the
fortunate
husband
of
some
rich
heiress
ladies
ladies
the
young
gentlemen
are
often
swindlers
and
always
fools
so
pray
you
avoid
them
the
young
ladies
young
gentleman
this
young
gentleman
has
several
titles
some
young
ladies
consider
him
a
nice
young
man
others
a
fine
young
man
others
quite
a
lady
s
man
others
a
handsome
man
others
a
remarkably
young
with
some
young
ladies
he
is
a
perfect
angel
and
with
others
quite
a
he
is
likewise
a
charming
creature
a
duck
and
a
dear
the
young
ladies
young
gentleman
has
usually
a
fresh
colour
and
very
white
teeth
which
latter
articles
of
course
he
displays
on
every
possible
opportunity
he
has
brown
or
black
hair
and
whiskers
of
the
same
if
possible
but
a
slight
tinge
of
red
or
the
hue
which
is
vulgarly
known
as
is
not
considered
an
objection
if
his
head
and
face
be
large
his
nose
prominent
and
his
figure
square
he
is
an
uncommonly
fine
young
man
and
worshipped
accordingly
should
his
whiskers
meet
beneath
his
chin
so
much
the
better
though
this
is
not
absolutely
insisted
on
but
he
must
wear
an
and
smile
constantly
there
was
a
great
party
got
up
by
some
friends
of
ours
last
summer
to
go
and
dine
in
epping
forest
as
we
hold
that
such
wild
expeditions
should
never
be
indulged
in
save
by
people
of
the
smallest
means
who
have
no
dinner
at
home
we
should
indubitably
have
excused
ourself
from
attending
if
we
had
not
recollected
that
the
projectors
of
the
excursion
were
always
accompanied
on
such
occasions
by
a
choice
sample
of
the
young
ladies
young
gentleman
whom
we
were
very
anxious
to
have
an
opportunity
of
meeting
this
determined
us
and
we
went
we
were
to
make
for
chigwell
in
four
glass
coaches
each
with
a
trifling
company
of
six
or
eight
inside
and
a
little
boy
belonging
to
the
projectors
on
the
to
start
from
the
residence
of
the
projectors
at
ten
precisely
we
arrived
at
the
place
of
rendezvous
at
the
appointed
time
and
found
the
glass
coaches
and
the
little
boys
quite
ready
and
divers
young
ladies
and
young
gentlemen
looking
anxiously
over
the
blinds
who
appeared
by
no
means
so
much
gratified
by
our
approach
as
we
might
have
expected
but
evidently
wished
we
had
been
somebody
else
observing
that
our
arrival
in
lieu
of
the
unknown
occasioned
some
disappointment
we
ventured
to
inquire
who
was
yet
to
come
when
we
found
from
the
hasty
reply
of
a
dozen
voices
that
it
was
no
other
than
the
young
ladies
young
gentleman
i
can
not
imagine
said
the
mamma
what
has
become
of
so
punctual
always
so
pleasant
and
agreeable
i
am
sure
i
as
these
last
words
were
uttered
in
that
measured
emphatic
manner
which
painfully
announces
that
the
speaker
has
not
quite
made
up
his
or
her
mind
what
to
say
but
is
determined
to
talk
on
nevertheless
the
eldest
daughter
took
up
the
subject
and
hoped
no
accident
had
happened
to
balim
upon
which
there
was
a
general
chorus
of
dear
balim
and
one
young
lady
more
adventurous
than
the
rest
proposed
that
an
express
should
be
straightway
sent
to
dear
balim
s
lodgings
this
however
the
papa
resolutely
opposed
observing
in
what
a
short
young
lady
behind
us
termed
quite
a
bearish
way
that
if
balim
didn
t
choose
to
come
he
might
stop
at
home
at
this
all
the
daughters
raised
a
murmur
of
oh
pa
except
one
sprightly
little
girl
of
eight
or
ten
years
old
who
taking
advantage
of
a
pause
in
the
discourse
remarked
that
perhaps
balim
might
have
been
married
that
which
impertinent
suggestion
she
was
summarily
ejected
from
the
room
by
her
eldest
sister
picture
the
young
ladies
young
gentleman
we
were
all
in
a
state
of
great
mortification
and
uneasiness
when
one
of
the
little
boys
running
into
the
room
as
airily
as
little
boys
usually
run
who
have
an
unlimited
allowance
of
animal
food
in
the
holidays
and
keep
their
hands
constantly
forced
down
to
the
bottoms
of
very
deep
when
they
take
exercise
joyfully
announced
that
balim
was
at
that
moment
coming
up
the
street
in
a
and
the
intelligence
was
confirmed
beyond
all
doubt
a
minute
afterwards
by
the
entry
of
balim
himself
who
was
received
with
repeated
cries
of
where
have
you
been
you
naughty
creature
whereunto
the
naughty
creature
replied
that
he
had
been
in
bed
in
consequence
of
a
late
party
the
night
before
and
had
only
just
risen
the
acknowledgment
awakened
a
variety
of
agonizing
fears
that
he
had
taken
no
breakfast
which
appearing
after
a
slight
to
be
the
real
state
of
the
case
breakfast
for
one
was
immediately
ordered
notwithstanding
balim
s
repeated
protestations
that
he
couldn
t
think
of
it
he
did
think
of
it
though
and
thought
better
of
it
too
for
he
made
a
remarkably
good
meal
when
it
came
and
was
assiduously
served
by
a
select
knot
of
young
ladies
it
was
quite
delightful
to
see
how
he
ate
and
drank
while
one
pair
of
fair
hands
poured
out
his
coffee
and
another
put
in
the
sugar
and
another
the
milk
the
rest
of
the
company
ever
and
anon
casting
angry
glances
at
their
watches
and
the
glass
coaches
the
little
boys
looking
on
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
lest
it
should
begin
to
rain
before
we
set
out
it
might
have
rained
all
day
after
we
were
once
too
far
to
turn
back
again
and
welcome
for
aught
they
cared
however
the
cavalcade
moved
at
length
every
coachman
being
accommodated
with
a
hamper
between
his
legs
something
larger
than
a
wheelbarrow
and
the
company
being
packed
as
closely
as
they
possibly
could
in
the
carriages
according
as
one
married
lady
observed
to
the
immemorial
custom
which
was
half
the
diversion
of
gipsy
thinking
it
very
likely
it
might
be
we
have
never
been
able
to
discover
the
other
half
we
submitted
to
be
stowed
away
with
a
cheerful
aspect
and
were
fortunate
enough
to
occupy
one
corner
of
a
coach
in
which
were
one
old
lady
four
young
ladies
and
the
renowned
balim
the
young
ladies
young
gentleman
we
were
no
sooner
fairly
off
than
the
young
ladies
young
gentleman
hummed
a
fragment
of
an
air
which
induced
a
young
lady
to
inquire
whether
he
had
danced
to
that
the
night
before
by
heaven
then
i
did
replied
the
young
gentleman
and
with
a
lovely
heiress
a
superb
creature
with
twenty
thousand
you
seem
rather
struck
observed
another
young
lady
gad
she
was
a
sweet
creature
returned
the
young
gentleman
arranging
his
hair
of
course
was
struck
too
inquired
the
first
young
lady
how
can
you
ask
love
interposed
the
second
could
she
fail
to
be
well
honestly
i
think
she
was
observed
the
young
gentleman
at
this
point
of
the
dialogue
the
young
lady
who
had
spoken
first
and
who
sat
on
the
young
gentleman
s
right
struck
him
a
severe
blow
on
the
arm
with
a
rosebud
and
said
he
was
a
vain
the
young
gentleman
insisted
on
having
the
rosebud
and
the
young
lady
appealing
for
help
to
the
other
young
ladies
a
charming
struggle
ensued
terminating
in
the
victory
of
the
young
gentleman
and
the
capture
of
the
rosebud
this
little
skirmish
over
the
married
lady
who
was
the
mother
of
the
rosebud
smiled
sweetly
upon
the
young
gentleman
and
accused
him
of
being
a
flirt
the
young
gentleman
pleading
not
guilty
a
most
interesting
discussion
took
place
upon
the
important
point
whether
the
young
gentleman
was
a
flirt
or
not
which
being
an
agreeable
conversation
of
a
light
kind
lasted
a
considerable
time
at
length
a
short
silence
occurring
the
young
ladies
on
either
side
of
the
young
gentleman
fell
suddenly
fast
asleep
and
the
young
gentleman
winking
upon
us
to
preserve
silence
won
a
pair
of
gloves
from
each
thereby
causing
them
to
wake
with
equal
suddenness
and
to
scream
very
loud
the
lively
conversation
to
which
this
pleasantry
gave
rise
lasted
for
the
remainder
of
the
ride
and
would
have
eked
out
a
much
longer
one
we
dined
rather
more
comfortably
than
people
usually
do
under
such
circumstances
nothing
having
been
left
behind
but
the
and
the
bread
the
married
gentlemen
were
unusually
thirsty
which
they
attributed
to
the
heat
of
the
weather
the
little
boys
ate
to
inconvenience
mammas
were
very
jovial
and
their
daughters
very
fascinating
and
the
attendants
being
men
got
exceedingly
drunk
at
a
respectful
distance
we
had
our
eye
on
balim
at
and
perceived
that
he
flourished
wonderfully
being
still
surrounded
by
a
little
group
of
young
ladies
who
listened
to
him
as
an
oracle
while
he
ate
from
their
plates
and
drank
from
their
glasses
in
a
manner
truly
captivating
from
its
excessive
playfulness
his
conversation
too
was
exceedingly
brilliant
in
fact
one
elderly
lady
assured
us
that
in
the
course
of
a
little
lively
on
the
subject
of
ladies
dresses
he
had
evinced
as
much
knowledge
as
if
he
had
been
born
and
bred
a
milliner
as
such
of
the
fat
people
who
did
not
happen
to
fall
asleep
after
dinner
entered
upon
a
most
vigorous
game
at
ball
we
slipped
away
alone
into
a
thicker
part
of
the
wood
hoping
to
fall
in
with
balim
the
greater
part
of
the
young
people
having
dropped
off
in
twos
and
threes
and
the
young
ladies
young
gentleman
among
them
nor
were
we
disappointed
for
we
had
not
walked
far
when
peeping
through
the
trees
we
discovered
him
before
us
and
truly
it
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
contemplate
his
greatness
the
young
ladies
young
gentleman
was
seated
upon
the
ground
at
the
feet
of
a
few
young
ladies
who
were
reclining
on
a
bank
he
was
so
profusely
decked
with
scarfs
ribands
flowers
and
other
pretty
spoils
that
he
looked
like
a
perhaps
a
calf
would
be
a
better
for
the
sacrifice
one
young
lady
supported
a
parasol
over
his
interesting
head
another
held
his
hat
and
a
third
his
which
in
romantic
fashion
he
had
thrown
off
the
young
gentleman
himself
with
his
hand
upon
his
breast
and
his
face
moulded
into
an
expression
of
the
most
honeyed
sweetness
was
warbling
forth
some
choice
specimens
of
vocal
music
in
praise
of
female
loveliness
in
a
style
so
exquisitely
perfect
that
we
burst
into
an
involuntary
shout
of
laughter
and
made
a
hasty
retreat
what
charming
fellows
these
young
ladies
young
gentlemen
are
ducks
dears
loves
angels
are
all
terms
inadequate
to
express
their
merit
they
are
such
amazingly
uncommonly
wonderfully
nice
men
conclusion
as
we
have
placed
before
the
young
ladies
so
many
specimens
of
young
gentlemen
and
have
also
in
the
dedication
of
this
volume
given
them
to
understand
how
much
we
reverence
and
admire
their
numerous
virtues
and
perfections
as
we
have
given
them
such
strong
reasons
to
treat
us
with
confidence
and
to
banish
in
our
case
all
that
reserve
and
distrust
of
the
male
sex
which
as
a
point
of
general
behaviour
they
can
not
do
better
than
preserve
and
say
as
we
have
done
all
this
we
feel
that
now
when
we
have
arrived
at
the
close
of
our
task
they
may
naturally
press
upon
us
the
inquiry
what
particular
description
of
young
gentlemen
we
can
conscientiously
recommend
here
we
are
at
a
loss
we
look
over
our
list
and
can
neither
recommend
the
bashful
young
gentleman
nor
the
young
gentleman
nor
the
very
friendly
young
gentleman
nor
the
military
young
gentleman
nor
the
political
young
gentleman
nor
the
domestic
young
gentleman
nor
the
censorious
young
gentleman
nor
the
funny
young
gentleman
nor
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
nor
the
poetical
young
gentleman
nor
the
young
gentleman
nor
the
young
ladies
young
gentleman
as
there
are
some
good
points
about
many
of
them
which
still
are
not
sufficiently
numerous
to
render
any
one
among
them
eligible
as
a
whole
our
respectful
advice
to
the
young
ladies
is
to
seek
for
a
young
gentleman
who
unites
in
himself
the
best
qualities
of
all
and
the
worst
weaknesses
of
none
and
to
lead
him
forthwith
to
the
hymeneal
altar
whether
he
will
or
no
and
to
the
young
lady
who
secures
him
we
beg
to
tender
one
short
fragment
of
matrimonial
advice
selected
from
many
sound
passages
of
a
similar
tendency
to
be
found
in
a
letter
written
by
dean
swift
to
a
young
lady
on
her
marriage
the
grand
affair
of
your
life
will
be
to
gain
and
preserve
the
esteem
of
your
husband
neither
nor
virtue
will
suffer
him
to
you
against
his
judgment
and
although
he
is
not
capable
of
using
you
ill
yet
you
will
in
time
grow
a
thing
indifferent
and
perhaps
contemptible
unless
you
can
supply
the
loss
of
youth
and
beauty
with
more
durable
qualities
you
have
but
a
very
few
years
to
be
young
and
handsome
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
as
few
months
to
be
so
in
the
eyes
of
a
husband
who
is
not
a
fool
for
i
hope
you
do
not
still
dream
of
charms
and
raptures
which
marriage
ever
did
and
ever
will
put
a
sudden
end
from
the
anxiety
we
express
for
the
proper
behaviour
of
the
fortunate
lady
after
marriage
it
may
possibly
be
inferred
that
the
young
gentleman
to
whom
we
have
so
delicately
alluded
is
no
other
than
ourself
without
in
any
way
committing
ourself
upon
this
point
we
have
merely
to
observe
that
we
are
ready
to
receive
sealed
offers
containing
a
full
specification
of
age
temper
appearance
and
condition
but
we
beg
it
to
be
distinctly
understood
that
we
do
not
pledge
ourself
to
accept
the
highest
bidder
these
offers
may
be
forwarded
to
the
publishers
chapman
and
hall
london
to
whom
all
pieces
of
plate
and
other
testimonials
of
approbation
from
the
young
ladies
generally
are
respectfully
requested
to
be
addressed
