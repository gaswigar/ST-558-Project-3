the
old
wives
tale
arnold
bennett
to
preface
to
this
edition
in
the
autumn
of
i
used
to
dine
frequently
in
a
restaurant
in
the
rue
de
clichy
paris
here
were
among
others
two
waitresses
that
attracted
my
attention
one
was
a
beautiful
pale
young
girl
to
whom
i
never
spoke
for
she
was
employed
far
away
from
the
table
which
i
affected
the
other
a
stout
managing
breton
woman
had
sole
command
over
my
table
and
me
and
gradually
she
began
to
assume
such
a
maternal
tone
towards
me
that
i
saw
i
should
be
compelled
to
leave
that
restaurant
if
i
was
absent
for
a
couple
of
nights
running
she
would
reproach
me
sharply
what
you
are
unfaithful
to
me
once
when
i
complained
about
some
french
beans
she
informed
me
roundly
that
french
beans
were
a
subject
which
i
did
not
understand
i
then
decided
to
be
eternally
unfaithful
to
her
and
i
abandoned
the
restaurant
a
few
nights
before
the
final
parting
an
old
woman
came
into
the
restaurant
to
dine
she
was
fat
shapeless
ugly
and
grotesque
she
had
a
ridiculous
voice
and
ridiculous
gestures
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
lived
alone
and
that
in
the
long
lapse
of
years
she
had
developed
the
kind
of
peculiarity
which
induces
guffaws
among
the
thoughtless
she
was
burdened
with
a
lot
of
small
parcels
which
she
kept
dropping
she
chose
one
seat
and
then
not
liking
it
chose
another
and
then
another
in
a
few
moments
she
had
the
whole
restaurant
laughing
at
her
that
my
breton
should
laugh
was
indifferent
to
me
but
i
was
pained
to
see
a
coarse
grimace
of
giggling
on
the
pale
face
of
the
beautiful
young
waitress
to
whom
i
had
never
spoken
i
reflected
concerning
the
grotesque
diner
this
woman
was
once
young
slim
perhaps
beautiful
certainly
free
from
these
ridiculous
mannerisms
very
probably
she
is
unconscious
of
her
singularities
her
case
is
a
tragedy
one
ought
to
be
able
to
make
a
heartrending
novel
out
of
the
history
of
a
woman
such
as
she
every
stout
ageing
woman
is
not
grotesque
far
from
it
but
there
is
an
extreme
pathos
in
the
mere
fact
that
every
stout
ageing
woman
was
once
a
young
girl
with
the
unique
charm
of
youth
in
her
form
and
movements
and
in
her
mind
and
the
fact
that
the
change
from
the
young
girl
to
the
stout
ageing
woman
is
made
up
of
an
infinite
number
of
infinitesimal
changes
each
unperceived
by
her
only
intensifies
the
pathos
it
was
at
this
instant
that
i
was
visited
by
the
idea
of
writing
the
book
which
ultimately
became
the
old
wives
tale
of
course
i
felt
that
the
woman
who
caused
the
ignoble
mirth
in
the
restaurant
would
not
serve
me
as
a
type
of
heroine
for
she
was
much
too
old
and
obviously
unsympathetic
it
is
an
absolute
rule
that
the
principal
character
of
a
novel
must
not
be
unsympathetic
and
the
whole
modern
tendency
of
realistic
fiction
is
against
oddness
in
a
prominent
figure
i
knew
that
i
must
choose
the
sort
of
woman
who
would
pass
unnoticed
in
a
crowd
i
put
the
idea
aside
for
a
long
time
but
it
was
never
very
distant
from
me
for
several
reasons
it
made
a
special
appeal
to
me
i
had
always
been
a
convinced
admirer
of
clifford
most
precious
novel
aunt
anne
but
i
wanted
to
see
in
the
story
of
an
old
woman
many
things
that
clifford
had
omitted
from
aunt
anne
moreover
i
had
always
revolted
against
the
absurd
youthfulness
the
unfading
youthfulness
of
the
average
heroine
and
as
a
protest
against
this
fashion
i
was
already
in
planning
a
novel
leonora
of
which
the
heroine
was
aged
forty
and
had
daughters
old
enough
to
be
in
love
the
reviewers
by
the
way
were
staggered
by
my
hardihood
in
offering
a
woman
of
forty
as
a
subject
of
serious
interest
to
the
public
but
i
meant
to
go
much
farther
than
forty
finally
as
a
supreme
reason
i
had
the
example
and
the
challenge
of
guy
de
maupassant
une
vie
in
the
nineties
we
used
to
regard
une
vie
with
mute
awe
as
being
the
summit
of
achievement
in
fiction
and
i
remember
being
very
cross
with
bernard
shaw
because
having
read
une
vie
at
the
suggestion
i
think
of
william
archer
he
failed
to
see
in
it
anything
very
remarkable
here
i
must
confess
that
in
i
read
une
vie
again
and
in
spite
of
a
natural
anxiety
to
differ
from
bernard
shaw
i
was
gravely
disappointed
with
it
it
is
a
fine
novel
but
decidedly
inferior
to
pierre
et
jean
or
even
fort
comme
la
mort
to
return
to
the
year
une
vie
relates
the
entire
life
history
of
a
woman
i
settled
in
the
privacy
of
my
own
head
that
my
book
about
the
development
of
a
young
girl
into
a
stout
old
lady
must
be
the
english
une
vie
i
have
been
accused
of
every
fault
except
a
lack
of
and
in
a
few
weeks
i
settled
a
further
point
namely
that
my
book
must
go
one
better
than
une
vie
and
that
to
this
end
it
must
be
the
of
two
women
instead
of
only
one
hence
the
old
wives
tale
has
two
heroines
constance
was
the
original
sophia
was
created
out
of
bravado
just
to
indicate
that
i
declined
to
consider
guy
de
maupassant
as
the
last
forerunner
of
the
deluge
i
was
intimidated
by
the
audacity
of
my
project
but
i
had
sworn
to
carry
it
out
for
several
years
i
looked
it
squarely
in
the
face
at
intervals
and
then
walked
away
to
write
novels
of
smaller
scope
of
which
i
produced
five
or
six
but
i
could
not
dally
forever
and
in
the
autumn
of
i
actually
began
to
write
it
in
a
village
near
fontainebleau
where
i
rented
half
a
house
from
a
retired
railway
servant
i
calculated
that
it
would
be
words
long
which
it
exactly
proved
to
be
and
i
had
a
vague
notion
that
no
novel
of
such
dimensions
except
richardson
had
ever
been
written
before
so
i
counted
the
words
in
several
famous
victorian
novels
and
discovered
to
my
relief
that
the
famous
victorian
novels
average
words
apiece
i
wrote
the
first
part
of
the
novel
in
six
weeks
it
was
fairly
easy
to
me
because
in
the
seventies
in
the
first
decade
of
my
life
i
had
lived
in
the
actual
draper
shop
of
the
baines
and
knew
it
as
only
a
child
could
know
it
then
i
went
to
london
on
a
visit
i
tried
to
continue
the
book
in
a
london
hotel
but
london
was
too
distracting
and
i
put
the
thing
away
and
during
january
and
february
of
i
wrote
buried
alive
which
was
published
immediately
and
was
received
with
majestic
indifference
by
the
english
public
an
indifference
which
has
persisted
to
this
day
i
then
returned
to
the
fontainebleau
region
and
gave
the
old
tale
no
rest
till
i
finished
it
at
the
end
of
july
it
was
published
in
the
autumn
of
the
same
year
and
for
six
weeks
afterward
the
english
public
steadily
confirmed
an
opinion
expressed
by
a
certain
person
in
whose
judgment
i
had
confidence
to
the
effect
that
the
work
was
honest
but
dull
and
that
when
it
was
not
dull
it
had
a
regrettable
tendency
to
facetiousness
my
publishers
though
brave
fellows
were
somewhat
disheartened
however
the
reception
of
the
book
gradually
became
less
and
less
frigid
with
regard
to
the
french
portion
of
the
story
it
was
not
until
i
had
written
the
first
part
that
i
saw
from
a
study
of
my
chronological
basis
that
the
siege
of
paris
might
be
brought
into
the
tale
the
idea
was
seductive
but
i
hated
and
still
hate
the
awful
business
of
research
and
i
only
knew
the
paris
of
the
twentieth
century
now
i
was
aware
that
my
railway
servant
and
his
wife
had
been
living
in
paris
at
the
time
of
the
war
i
said
to
the
old
man
by
the
way
you
went
through
the
siege
of
paris
did
you
he
turned
to
his
old
wife
and
said
uncertainly
the
siege
of
paris
yes
we
did
did
we
the
siege
of
paris
had
been
only
one
incident
among
many
in
their
lives
of
course
they
remembered
it
well
though
not
vividly
and
i
gained
much
information
from
them
but
the
most
useful
thing
which
i
gained
from
them
was
the
perception
startling
at
first
that
ordinary
people
went
on
living
very
ordinary
lives
in
paris
during
the
siege
and
that
to
the
vast
mass
of
the
population
the
siege
was
not
the
dramatic
spectacular
thrilling
ecstatic
affair
that
is
described
in
history
encouraged
by
this
perception
i
decided
to
include
the
siege
in
my
scheme
i
read
sarcey
diary
of
the
siege
aloud
to
my
wife
and
i
looked
at
the
pictures
in
jules
claretie
popular
work
on
the
siege
and
the
commune
and
i
glanced
at
the
printed
collection
of
official
documents
and
there
my
research
ended
it
has
been
asserted
that
unless
i
had
actually
been
present
at
a
public
execution
i
could
not
have
written
the
chapter
in
which
sophia
was
at
the
auxerre
solemnity
i
have
not
been
present
at
a
public
execution
as
the
whole
of
my
information
about
public
executions
was
derived
from
a
series
of
articles
on
them
which
i
read
in
the
paris
matin
frank
harris
discussing
my
book
in
vanity
fair
said
it
was
clear
that
i
had
not
seen
an
execution
or
words
to
that
effect
and
he
proceeded
to
give
his
own
description
of
an
execution
it
was
a
brief
but
terribly
convincing
bit
of
writing
quite
characteristic
and
quite
worthy
of
the
author
of
montes
the
matador
and
of
a
man
who
has
been
almost
everywhere
and
seen
almost
everything
i
comprehended
how
far
short
i
had
fallen
of
the
truth
i
wrote
to
frank
harris
regretting
that
his
description
had
not
been
printed
before
i
wrote
mine
as
i
should
assuredly
have
utilized
it
and
of
course
i
admitted
that
i
had
never
witnessed
an
execution
he
simply
replied
neither
have
i
this
detail
is
worth
preserving
for
it
is
a
reproof
to
that
large
body
of
readers
who
when
a
novelist
has
really
carried
conviction
to

situation
of

indeed

had
never

they
were
for

established

precisely
on

latitude

little
way
to
the
north
of

creases
of

hill
famous
for
its
religious
orgies
rose
the
river

calm
and
characteristic
stream
of
middle
england
somewhat
further
northwards
in
the
near
neighbourhood
of
the
highest
in

realm
rose
two
lesser
rivers
the
dane
and
the
dove
which
quarrelling
in
early
infancy
turned
their
backs
on
each
other
and
the
one
by
favour
of
the
weaver
and
the
other
by

of
the
trent
watered
between
them
the
whole
width
of
england
and
poured
themselves
respectively
into
the
irish
sea
and
the
german
ocean
what
a
county
of
modest
unnoticed
rivers
what
a
natural
simple
county

to
fix
its
boundaries

tortuous
island

that

excess
is
deprecated
the
county
is
happy
in
not
exciting
remark
it
is
content
that
shropshire
should
possess
that
swollen
bump
the
wrekin
and
that
the
exaggerated
wildness
of
the
peak
should
lie
over
its
border
it
does
not
desire
to
be
a
pancake
like
cheshire
it
has
everything
that
england
has
including
thirty
miles
of
watling
street
and
england
can
show
nothing
more
beautiful
and
nothing
uglier
than
the
works
of
nature
and
the
works
of
man
to
be
seen
within
the
limits
of
the
county
it
is
england
in
little
lost
in
the
midst
of
england
unsung
by
searchers
after
the
extreme
perhaps
occasionally
somewhat
sore
at
this
neglect
but
how
proud
in
the
instinctive
cognizance
of
its
representative
features
and
traits
constance
and
sophia
busy
with
the
intense
preoccupations
of
youth
recked
not
of
such
matters
they
were
surrounded
by
the
county
on
every
side
the
fields
and
moors
of
staffordshire
intersected
by
roads
and
lanes
railways
watercourses
and
patterned
by
hedges
ornamented
and
made
respectable
by
halls
and
genteel
parks
enlivened
by
villages
at
the
intersections
and
warmly
surveyed
by
the
sun
spread
out
undulating
and
trains
were
rushing
round
curves
in
deep
cuttings
and
carts
and
waggons
trotting
and
jingling
on
the
yellow
roads
and
long
narrow
boats
passing
in
a
leisure
majestic
and
infinite
over
the
surface
of
the
stolid
canals
the
rivers
had
only
themselves
to
support
for
staffordshire
rivers
have
remained
virgin
of
keels
to
this
day
one
could
imagine
the
messages
concerning
prices
sudden
death
and
horses
in
their
flight
through
the
wires
under
the
feet
of
birds
in
the
inns
utopians
were
shouting
the
universe
into
order
over
beer
and
in
the
halls
and
parks
the
dignity
of
england
was
being
preserved
in
a
fitting
manner
the
villages
were
full
of
women
who
did
nothing
but
fight
against
dirt
and
hunger
and
repair
the
effects
of
friction
on
clothes
thousands
of
labourers
were
in
the
fields
but
the
fields
were
so
broad
and
numerous
that
this
scattered
multitude
was
totally
lost
therein
the
cuckoo
was
much
more
perceptible
than
man
dominating
whole
square
miles
with
his
resounding
call
and
on
the
airy
moors
played
in
the
ineffaceable
that
had
served
centuries
before
even
the
romans
thought
of
watling
street
in
short
the
usual
daily
life
of
the
county
was
proceeding
with
all
its
immense
variety
and
importance
but
though
constance
and
sophia
were
in
it
they
were
not
of
it
the
fact
is
that
while
in
the
county
they
were
also
in
the
district
and
no
person
who
lives
in
the
district
even
if
he
should
be
old
and
have
nothing
to
do
but
reflect
upon
things
in
general
ever
thinks
about
the
county
so
far
as
the
county
goes
the
district
might
almost
as
well
be
in
the
middle
of
the
sahara
it
ignores
the
county
save
that
it
uses
it
nonchalantly
sometimes
as
on
holiday
afternoons
as
a
man
may
use
his
back
garden
it
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
county
it
is
richly
sufficient
to
itself
nevertheless
its
and
the
true
salt
savour
of
its
life
can
only
be
appreciated
by
picturing
it
hemmed
in
by
county
it
lies
on
the
face
of
the
county
like
an
insignificant
stain
like
a
dark
pleiades
in
a
green
and
empty
sky
and
hanbridge
has
the
shape
of
a
horse
and
its
rider
bursley
of
half
a
donkey
knype
of
a
pair
of
trousers
longshaw
of
an
octopus
and
little
turnhill
of
a
beetle
the
five
towns
seem
to
cling
together
for
safety
yet
the
idea
of
clinging
together
for
safety
would
make
them
laugh
they
are
unique
and
indispensable
from
the
north
of
the
county
right
down
to
the
south
they
alone
stand
for
civilization
applied
science
organized
manufacture
and
the
century
until
you
come
to
wolverhampton
they
are
unique
and
indispensable
because
you
can
not
drink
tea
out
of
a
teacup
without
the
aid
of
the
five
towns
because
you
can
not
eat
a
meal
in
decency
without
the
aid
of
the
five
towns
for
this
the
architecture
of
the
five
towns
is
an
architecture
of
ovens
and
chimneys
for
this
its
atmosphere
is
as
black
as
its
mud
for
this
it
burns
and
smokes
all
night
so
that
longshaw
has
been
compared
to
hell
for
this
it
is
unlearned
in
the
ways
of
agriculture
never
having
seen
corn
except
as
packing
straw
and
in
quartern
loaves
for
this
on
the
other
hand
it
comprehends
the
mysterious
habits
of
fire
and
pure
sterile
earth
for
this
it
lives
crammed
together
in
slippery
streets
where
the
housewife
must
change
white
at
least
once
a
fortnight
if
she
wishes
to
remain
respectable
for
this
it
gets
up
in
the
mass
at
six
winter
and
summer
and
goes
to
bed
when
the
close
for
this
it
exists
that
you
may
drink
tea
out
of
a
teacup
and
toy
with
a
chop
on
a
plate
all
the
everyday
crockery
used
in
the
kingdom
is
made
in
the
five
towns
all
and
much
besides
a
district
capable
of
such
gigantic
manufacture
of
such
a
perfect
monopoly
and
which
finds
energy
also
to
produce
coal
and
iron
and
great
men
may
be
an
insignificant
stain
on
a
county
considered
geographically
but
it
is
surely
well
justified
in
treating
the
county
as
its
back
garden
once
a
week
and
in
blindly
ignoring
it
the
rest
of
the
time
even
the
majestic
thought
that
whenever
and
wherever
in
all
england
a
woman
washes
up
she
washes
up
the
product
of
the
district
that
whenever
and
wherever
in
all
england
a
plate
is
broken
the
fracture
means
new
business
for
the
district
even
this
majestic
thought
had
probably
never
occurred
to
either
of
the
girls
the
fact
is
that
while
in
the
five
towns
they
were
also
in
the
square
bursley
and
the
square
ignored
the
staple
manufacture
as
perfectly
as
the
district
ignored
the
county
bursley
has
the
honours
of
antiquity
in
the
five
towns
no
industrial
development
can
ever
rob
it
of
its
superiority
in
age
which
makes
it
absolutely
sure
in
its
conceit
and
the
time
will
never
come
when
the
other
towns
let
them
swell
and
bluster
as
they
may
will
not
pronounce
the
name
of
bursley
as
one
pronounces
the
name
of
mother
add
to
this
that
the
square
was
the
centre
of
bursley
retail
trade
which
scorned
the
staple
as
something
wholesale
vulgar
and
assuredly
filthy
and
you
will
comprehend
the
importance
and
the
of
the
square
in
the
scheme
of
the
created
universe
there
you
have
it
embedded
in
the
district
and
the
district
embedded
in
the
county
and
the
county
lost
and
dreaming
in
the
heart
of
england
the
square
was
named
after
luke
the
evangelist
might
have
been
startled
by
certain
phenomena
in
his
square
but
except
in
wakes
week
when
the
shocking
always
happened
luke
square
lived
in
a
manner
passably
saintly
though
it
contained
five
it
contained
five
a
bank
a
barber
a
confectioner
three
grocers
two
chemists
an
ironmonger
a
clothier
and
five
drapers
these
were
all
the
catalogue
luke
square
had
no
room
for
minor
establishments
the
aristocracy
of
the
square
undoubtedly
consisted
of
the
drapers
for
the
bank
was
impersonal
and
among
the
five
the
shop
of
baines
stood
supreme
no
business
establishment
could
possibly
be
more
respected
than
that
of
baines
was
respected
and
though
john
baines
had
been
bedridden
for
a
dozen
years
he
still
lived
on
the
lips
of
admiring
ceremonious
burgesses
as
honoured
he
deserved
his
reputation
the
baines
shop
to
make
which
three
dwellings
had
at
intervals
been
thrown
into
one
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
square
it
formed
about
of
the
south
side
of
the
square
the
remainder
being
made
up
of
critchlow
chemist
the
clothier
and
the
hanover
spirit
vaults
vaults
was
a
favourite
synonym
of
the
in
the
square
only
two
of
the
were
crude
the
rest
were
vaults
it
was
a
composite
building
of
three
storeys
in
brick
with
a
projecting
and
above
and
behind
that
two
rows
of
little
windows
on
the
sash
of
each
window
was
a
red
cloth
roll
stuffed
with
sawdust
to
prevent
draughts
plain
white
blinds
descended
about
six
inches
from
the
top
of
each
window
there
were
no
curtains
to
any
of
the
windows
save
one
this
was
the
window
of
the
on
the
first
floor
at
the
corner
of
the
square
and
king
street
another
window
on
the
second
storey
was
peculiar
in
that
it
had
neither
blind
nor
pad
and
was
very
dirty
this
was
the
window
of
an
unused
room
that
had
a
separate
staircase
to
itself
the
staircase
being
barred
by
a
door
always
locked
constance
and
sophia
had
lived
in
continual
expectation
of
the
abnormal
issuing
from
that
mysterious
room
which
was
next
to
their
own
but
they
were
disappointed
the
room
had
no
shameful
secret
except
the
incompetence
of
the
architect
who
had
made
one
house
out
of
three
it
was
just
an
empty
unemployable
room
the
building
had
also
a
considerable
frontage
on
king
street
where
behind
the
shop
was
sheltered
the
parlour
with
a
large
window
and
a
door
that
led
directly
by
two
steps
into
the
street
a
strange
peculiarity
of
the
shop
was
that
it
bore
no
signboard
once
it
had
had
a
large
signboard
which
a
memorable
gale
had
blown
into
the
square
baines
had
decided
not
to
replace
it
he
had
always
objected
to
what
he
called
puffing
and
for
this
reason
would
never
hear
of
such
a
thing
as
a
clearance
sale
the
hatred
of
puffing
grew
on
him
until
he
came
to
regard
even
a
sign
as
puffing
uninformed
persons
who
wished
to
find
baines
must
ask
and
learn
for
baines
to
have
replaced
the
sign
would
have
been
to
condone
yea
to
participate
in
the
modern
craze
for
unscrupulous
this
abstention
of
baines
from
indulgence
in
signboards
was
somehow
accepted
by
the
more
thoughtful
members
of
the
community
as
evidence
that
the
height
of
baines
principles
was
greater
even
than
they
had
imagined
constance
and
sophia
were
the
daughters
of
this
credit
to
human
nature
he
had
no
other
children
ii
they
pressed
their
noses
against
the
window
of
the
and
gazed
down
into
the
square
as
perpendicularly
as
the
projecting
front
of
the
shop
would
allow
the
was
over
the
millinery
and
silken
half
of
the
shop
over
the
woollen
and
shirting
half
were
the
and
the
chief
bedroom
when
in
quest
of
articles
of
coquetry
you
mounted
from
the
shop
by
a
curving
stair
and
your
head
gradually
rose
level
with
a
large
apartment
having
a
mahogany
counter
in
front
of
the
window
and
along
one
side
yellow
linoleum
on
the
floor
many
cardboard
boxes
a
magnificent
hinged
cheval
glass
and
two
chairs
the
being
lower
than
the
counter
there
was
a
gulf
between
the
panes
and
the
back
of
the
counter
into
which
important
articles
such
as
scissors
pencils
chalk
and
artificial
flowers
were
continually
disappearing
another
proof
of
the
architect
incompetence
the
girls
could
only
press
their
noses
against
the
window
by
kneeling
on
the
counter
and
this
they
were
doing
constance
nose
was
snub
but
agreeably
so
sophia
had
a
fine
roman
nose
she
was
a
beautiful
creature
beautiful
and
handsome
at
the
same
time
they
were
both
of
them
rather
like
racehorses
quivering
with
delicate
sensitive
and
luxuriant
life
exquisite
enchanting
proof
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
innocent
artful
roguish
prim
gushing
ignorant
and
miraculously
wise
their
ages
were
sixteen
and
fifteen
it
is
an
epoch
when
if
one
is
frank
one
must
admit
that
one
has
nothing
to
learn
one
has
learnt
simply
everything
in
the
previous
six
months
there
she
goes
exclaimed
sophia
up
the
square
from
the
corner
of
king
street
passed
a
woman
in
a
new
bonnet
with
pink
strings
and
a
new
blue
dress
that
sloped
at
the
shoulders
and
grew
to
a
vast
circumference
at
the
hem
through
the
silent
sunlit
solitude
of
the
square
for
it
was
thursday
afternoon
and
all
the
shops
shut
except
the
confectioner
and
one
chemist
this
bonnet
and
this
dress
floated
northwards
in
search
of
romance
under
the
relentless
eyes
of
constance
and
sophia
within
them
somewhere
was
the
soul
of
maggie
domestic
servant
at
baines
maggie
had
been
at
the
shop
since
before
the
creation
of
constance
and
sophia
she
lived
seventeen
hours
of
each
day
in
an
underground
kitchen
and
larder
and
the
other
seven
in
an
attic
never
going
out
except
to
chapel
on
sunday
evenings
and
once
a
month
on
thursday
afternoons
followers
were
most
strictly
forbidden
to
her
but
on
rare
occasions
an
aunt
from
longshaw
was
permitted
as
a
tremendous
favour
to
see
her
in
the
subterranean
den
everybody
including
herself
considered
that
she
had
a
good
place
and
was
well
treated
it
was
undeniable
for
instance
that
she
was
allowed
to
fall
in
love
exactly
as
she
chose
provided
she
did
not
carry
on
in
the
kitchen
or
the
yard
and
as
a
fact
maggie
had
fallen
in
love
in
seventeen
years
she
had
been
engaged
eleven
times
no
one
could
conceive
how
that
ugly
and
powerful
organism
could
softly
languish
to
the
undoing
of
even
a
nor
why
having
caught
a
man
in
her
sweet
toils
she
could
ever
be
imbecile
enough
to
set
him
free
there
are
however
mysteries
in
the
souls
of
maggies
the
drudge
had
probably
been
affianced
oftener
than
any
woman
in
bursley
her
employers
were
so
accustomed
to
an
interesting
announcement
that
for
years
they
had
taken
to
saying
naught
in
reply
but
maggie
engagements
and
tragic
partings
were
maggie
pastime
fixed
otherwise
she
might
have
studied
the
piano
instead
no
gloves
of
course
sophia
criticized
well
you
ca
expect
her
to
have
gloves
said
constance
then
a
pause
as
the
bonnet
and
dress
neared
the
top
of
the
square
supposing
she
turns
round
and
sees
us
constance
suggested
i
do
care
if
she
does
said
sophia
with
a
haughtiness
almost
impassioned
and
her
head
trembled
slightly
there
were
as
usual
several
loafers
at
the
top
of
the
square
in
the
corner
between
the
bank
and
the
marquis
of
granby
and
one
of
these
loafers
stepped
forward
and
shook
hands
with
an
obviously
willing
maggie
clearly
it
was
a
rendezvous
open
unashamed
the
twelfth
victim
had
been
selected
by
the
virgin
of
forty
whose
kiss
would
not
have
melted
lard
the
couple
disappeared
together
down
oldcastle
street
well
cried
constance
did
you
ever
see
such
a
thing
while
sophia
short
of
adequate
words
flushed
and
bit
her
lip
with
the
profound
instinctive
cruelty
of
youth
constance
and
sophia
had
assembled
in
their
favourite
haunt
the
expressly
to
deride
maggie
in
her
new
clothes
they
obscurely
thought
that
a
woman
so
ugly
and
soiled
as
maggie
was
had
no
right
to
possess
new
clothes
even
her
desire
to
take
the
air
of
a
thursday
afternoon
seemed
to
them
unnatural
and
somewhat
reprehensible
why
should
she
want
to
stir
out
of
her
kitchen
as
for
her
tender
yearnings
they
positively
grudged
these
to
maggie
that
maggie
should
give
rein
to
chaste
passion
was
more
than
grotesque
it
was
offensive
and
wicked
but
let
it
not
for
an
instant
be
doubted
that
they
were
nice
and
delightful
girls
because
they
were
they
were
not
angels
it
too
ridiculous
said
sophia
severely
she
had
youth
beauty
and
rank
in
her
favour
and
to
her
it
really
was
ridiculous
poor
old
maggie
constance
murmured
constance
was
foolishly
a
perfect
manufactory
of
excuses
for
other
people
and
her
benevolence
was
eternally
rising
up
and
overpowering
her
reason
what
time
did
mother
say
she
should
be
back
sophia
asked
not
until
supper
oh
hallelujah
sophia
burst
out
clasping
her
hands
in
joy
and
they
both
slid
down
from
the
counter
just
as
if
they
had
been
little
boys
and
not
as
their
mother
called
them
great
girls
let
go
and
play
the
osborne
quadrilles
sophia
suggested
the
osborne
quadrilles
being
a
series
of
dances
arranged
to
be
performed
on
pianos
by
four
jewelled
hands
i
could
think
of
it
said
constance
with
a
precocious
gesture
of
seriousness
in
that
gesture
and
in
her
tone
was
something
which
conveyed
to
sophia
sophia
how
can
you
be
so
utterly
blind
to
the
gravity
of
our
fleeting
existence
as
to
ask
me
to
go
and
strum
the
piano
with
you
yet
a
moment
before
she
had
been
a
little
boy
why
not
sophia
demanded
i
shall
never
have
another
chance
like
for
getting
on
with
this
said
constance
picking
up
a
bag
from
the
counter
she
sat
down
and
took
from
the
bag
a
piece
of
loosely
woven
canvas
on
which
she
was
embroidering
a
bunch
of
roses
in
coloured
wools
the
canvas
had
once
been
stretched
on
a
frame
but
now
as
the
delicate
labour
of
the
petals
and
leaves
was
done
and
nothing
remained
to
do
but
the
monotonous
background
constance
was
content
to
pin
the
stuff
to
her
knee
with
the
long
needle
and
several
skeins
of
wool
she
bent
over
the
canvas
and
resumed
the
of
the
tiny
squares
the
whole
design
was
in
squares
the
gradations
of
red
and
greens
the
curves
of
the
smallest
buds
all
was
contrived
in
squares
with
a
result
that
mimicked
a
fragment
of
uncompromising
axminster
carpet
still
the
fine
texture
of
the
wool
the
regular
and
rapid
grace
of
those
fingers
moving
incessantly
at
back
and
front
of
the
canvas
the
gentle
sound
of
the
wool
as
it
passed
through
the
holes
and
the
intent
youthful
earnestness
of
that
lowered
gaze
excused
and
invested
with
charm
an
activity
which
on
artistic
grounds
could
not
possibly
be
justified
the
canvas
was
destined
to
adorn
a
gilt
firescreen
in
the
and
also
to
form
a
birthday
gift
to
baines
from
her
elder
daughter
but
whether
the
enterprise
was
as
secret
from
baines
as
constance
hoped
none
save
baines
knew
con
murmured
sophia
you
too
sickening
sometimes
well
said
constance
blandly
it
no
use
pretending
that
this
has
got
to
be
finished
before
we
go
back
to
school
because
it
has
sophia
wandered
about
a
prey
ripe
for
the
evil
one
oh
she
exclaimed
joyously
even
ecstatically
looking
behind
the
cheval
glass
here
mother
new
skirt
miss
dunn
been
putting
the
gimp
on
it
oh
mother
what
a
proud
thing
you
will
be
constance
heard
swishings
behind
the
glass
what
are
you
doing
sophia
nothing
you
surely
are
putting
that
skirt
on
why
not
you
catch
it
finely
i
can
tell
you
without
further
defence
sophia
sprang
out
from
behind
the
immense
glass
she
had
already
shed
a
notable
part
of
her
own
costume
and
the
flush
of
mischief
was
in
her
face
she
ran
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
examined
carefully
a
large
coloured
print
that
was
affixed
to
the
wall
this
print
represented
fifteen
sisters
all
of
the
same
height
and
slimness
of
figure
all
of
the
same
age
about
or
so
and
all
with
exactly
the
same
haughty
and
bored
beauty
that
they
were
in
truth
sisters
was
clear
from
the
facial
resemblance
between
them
their
demeanour
indicated
that
they
were
princesses
offspring
of
some
impossibly
prolific
king
and
queen
those
hands
had
never
toiled
nor
had
those
features
ever
relaxed
from
the
smile
of
courts
the
princesses
moved
in
a
landscape
of
marble
steps
and
verandahs
with
a
bandstand
and
strange
trees
in
the
distance
one
was
in
a
another
in
evening
attire
another
dressed
for
tea
another
for
the
theatre
another
seemed
to
be
ready
to
go
to
bed
one
held
a
little
girl
by
the
hand
it
could
not
have
been
her
own
little
girl
for
these
princesses
were
far
beyond
human
passions
where
had
she
obtained
the
little
girl
why
was
one
sister
going
to
the
theatre

why
was
one
in
a
heavy
mantle
and
another
sheltering
from
the
sun
rays
under
a
parasol
the
picture
was
drenched
in
mystery
and
the
strangest
thing
about
it
was
that
all
these
highnesses
were
apparently
content
with
the
most
ridiculous
and
fashions
absurd
hats
with
veils
flying
behind
absurd
bonnets
fitting
close
to
the
head
and
spotted
absurd
coiffures
that
nearly
lay
on

nape
absurd
clumsy
sleeves
absurd
waists
almost
above

elbow

absurd
scolloped
jackets
and
the
skirts
what
a

were
those
skirts
they
were
nothing
but
vast
decorated
pyramids
on
the
summit
of
each
was
stuck
the
upper
half
of
a
princess
it
was
astounding
that
princesses
should
consent
to
be
so
preposterous
and
so
uncomfortable
but
sophia
perceived
nothing
uncanny
in
the
picture
which
bore
the
legend
newest

sophia
had
never
imagined
anything
more
stylish
lovely
and
dashing
than
the
raiment
of
the
fifteen
princesses
for
constance
and
sophia
had
the
disadvantage
of
living
in
the
middle
ages
the
crinoline
had
not
quite
reached
its
full
circumference
and
the
had
not
even
been
thought
of
in
all
the
five
towns
there
was
not
a

nor
a
free
library
nor
a
municipal
park
nor
a
telephone
nor
yet
a

had
not
understood

necessity
of

on

garroting
was
the
chief
amusement
of

homicidal
classes
incredible
as
it
may
appear
there
was
nothing
but
a
running
between
bursley
and
hanbridge
and
that
only
twice
an
hour
and
between
the
other
towns
no
stage
of
any
kind
one
went
to

as
one
now
goes
to
pekin
it
was
an
era
so
dark
and
backward
that
one
might
wonder
how
people
could
sleep
in
their
beds
at
night
for
thinking
about
their
sad
state
happily
the
inhabitants
of
the
five
towns
in
that
era
were
passably
pleased
with
themselves
and
they
never
even
suspected
that
they
were
not
quite
modern
and
quite
awake
they
thought
that
the
intellectual
the
industrial
and
the
social
movements
had
gone
about
as
far
as
these
movements
could
go
and
they
were
amazed
at
their
own
progress
instead
of
being
humble
and
ashamed
they
actually
showed
pride
in
their
pitiful
achievements
they
ought
to
have
looked
forward
meekly
to
the
prodigious
feats
of
posterity
but
having
too
little
faith
and
too
much
conceit
they
were
content
to
look
behind
and
make
comparisons
with
the
past
they
did
not
foresee
the
miraculous
generation
which
is
us
a
poor
blind
complacent
people
the
ludicrous
was
typical
of
them
the
driver
rang
a
huge
bell
five
minutes
before
starting
that
could
be
heard
from
the
wesleyan
chapel
to
the
cock
yard
and
then
after
deliberations
and
hesitations
the
vehicle
rolled
off
on
its
rails
into
unknown
dangers
while
passengers
shouted
at
bleakridge
it
had
to
stop
for
the
turnpike
and
it
was
assisted
up
the
mountains
of
leveson
place
and
sutherland
street
towards
hanbridge
by
a
third
horse
on
whose
back
was
perched
a
tiny
boy
that
boy
lived
like
a
shuttle
on
the
road
between
leveson
place
and
sutherland
street
and
even
in
wet
weather
he
was
the
envy
of
all
other
boys
after
half
an
hour
perilous
transit
the
car
drew
up
solemnly
in
a
narrow
street
by
the
signal
office
in
hanbridge
and
the
ruddy
driver
having
revolved
many
times
the
polished
iron
handle
of
his
sole
brake
turned
his
attention
to
his
passengers
in
calm
triumph
dismissing
them
with
a
sort
of
unsung
doxology
and
this
was
regarded
as
the
last
word
of
traction
a
boy
on
a
tip
horse
oh
blind
blind
you
could
not
foresee
the
hundred
and
twenty
electric
cars
that
now
rush
madly
bumping
and
thundering
at
twenty
miles
an
hour
through
all
the
main
streets
of
the
district
so
that
naturally
sophia
infected
with
the
pride
of
her
period
had
no
misgivings
whatever
concerning
the
final
elegance
of
the
princesses
she
studied
them
as
the
fifteen
apostles
of
the
ne
plus
ultra
then
having
taken
some
flowers
and
plumes
out
of
a
box
amid
warnings
from
constance
she
retreated
behind
the
glass
and
presently
emerged
as
a
great
lady
in
the
style
of
the
princesses
her
mother
tremendous
new
gown
ballooned
about
her
in
all
its
fantastic
richness
and
expensiveness
and
with
the
gown
she
had
put
on
her
importance
that
mien
of
assured
authority
of
capacity
tested
in
many
a
crisis
which
characterized
baines
and
which
baines
seemed
to
impart
to
her
dresses
even
before
she
had
regularly
worn
them
for
it
was
a
fact
that
baines
empty
garments
inspired
respect
as
though
some
essence
had
escaped
from
her
and
remained
in
them
sophia
constance
stayed
her
needle
and
without
lifting
her
head
gazed
with
eyes
raised
from
the
motionless
at
the
posturing
figure
of
her
sister
it
was
sacrilege
that
she
was
witnessing
a
prodigious
irreverence
she
was
conscious
of
an
expectation
that
punishment
would
instantly
fall
on
this
daring
impious
child
but
she
who
never
felt
these
mad
amazing
impulses
could
nevertheless
only
smile
fearfully
sophia
she
breathed
with
an
intensity
of
alarm
that
merged
into
condoning
admiration
whatever
will
you
do
next
sophia
lovely
flushed
face
crowned
the
extraordinary
structure
like
a
blossom
scarcely
controlling
its
laughter
she
was
as
tall
as
her
mother
and
as
imperious
as
crested
and
proud
and
in
spite
of
the
pigtail
the
girlish
comb
and
the
loose
limbs
she
could
support
as
well
as
her
mother
the
majesty
of
the
dress
her
eyes
sparkled
with
all
the
challenges
of
the
untried
virgin
as
she
minced
about
the
showroom
abounding
life
inspired
her
movements
the
confident
and
fierce
joy
of
youth
shone
on
her
brow
what
thing
on
earth
equals
me
she
seemed
to
demand
with
enchanting
and
yet
ruthless
arrogance
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
respected
bedridden
draper
in
an
insignificant
town
lost
in
the
central
labyrinth
of
england
if
you
like
yet
what
manner
of
man
confronted
with
her
would
or
could
have
denied
her
naive
claim
to
dominion
she
stood
in
her
mother
hoops
for
the
desire
of
the
world
and
in
the
innocence
of
her
soul
she
knew
it
the
heart
of
a
young
girl
mysteriously
speaks
and
tells
her
of
her
power
long
ere
she
can
use
her
power
if
she
can
find
nothing
else
to
subdue
you
may
catch
her
in
the
early
years
subduing
a
or
drawing
homage
from
an
empty
chair
sophia
experimental
victim
was
constance
with
suspended
needle
and
soft
glance
that
shot
out
from
the
lowered
face
then
sophia
fell
in
stepping
backwards
the
pyramid
was
overbalanced
great
distended
rings
of
silk
trembled
and
swayed
gigantically
on
the
floor
and
sophia
small
feet
lay
like
the
feet
of
a
doll
on
the
rim
of
the
largest
circle
which
curved
and
arched
above
them
like
a
cavern
mouth
the
abrupt
transition
of
her
features
from
assured
pride
to
ludicrous
astonishment
and
alarm
was
comical
enough
to
have
sent
into
wild
uncharitable
laughter
any
creature
less
humane
than
constance
but
constance
sprang
to
her
a
single
embodied
instinct
of
benevolence
with
her
snub
nose
and
tried
to
raise
her
oh
sophia
she
cried
compassionately
that
voice
seemed
not
to
know
the
tones
of
reproof
i
do
hope
you
not
messed
it
because
mother
would
be
so
the
words
were
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
groans
beyond
the
door
leading
to
the
bedrooms
the
groans
indicating
direst
physical
torment
grew
louder
the
two
girls
stared
and
afraid
at
the
door
sophia
with
her
dark
head
raised
and
constance
with
her
arms
round
sophia
waist
the
door
opened
letting
in
a
sound
of
groans
and
there
entered
a
youngish
undersized
man
who
was
frantically
clutching
his
head
in
his
hands
and
contorting
all
the
muscles
of
his
face
on
perceiving
the
sculptural
group
of
two
prone
interlocked
girls
one
enveloped
in
a
crinoline
and
the
other
with
a
bunch
of
flowers
pinned
to
her
knee
he
jumped
back
ceased
groaning
arranged
his
face
and
seriously
tried
to
pretend
that
it
was
not
he
who
had
been
vocal
in
anguish
that
indeed
he
was
just
passing
as
a
casual
ordinary
wayfarer
through
the
showroom
to
the
shop
below
he
blushed
darkly
and
the
girls
also
blushed
oh
i
beg
pardon
i
sure
said
this
youngish
man
suddenly
and
with
a
swift
turn
he
disappeared
whence
he
had
come
he
was
povey
a
person
universally
esteemed
both
within
and
without
the
shop
the
surrogate
of
bedridden
baines
the
unfailing
comfort
and
of
baines
the
fount
and
radiating
centre
of
order
and
discipline
in
the
shop
a
quiet
diffident
secretive
tedious
and
obstinate
youngish
man
absolutely
faithful
absolutely
efficient
in
his
sphere
without
brilliance
without
distinction
perhaps
rather
certainly
but
what
a
force
in
the
shop
the
shop
was
inconceivable
without
povey
he
was
under
twenty
and
not
out
of
his
apprenticeship
when
baines
had
been
struck
down
and
he
had
at
once
proved
his
worth
of
the
assistants
he
alone
slept
in
the
house
his
bedroom
was
next
to
that
of
his
employer
there
was
a
door
between
the
two
chambers
and
the
two
steps
led
down
from
the
larger
to
the
less
the
girls
regained
their
feet
sophia
with
constance
help
it
was
not
easy
to
right
a
capsized
crinoline
they
both
began
to
laugh
nervously
with
a
trace
of
hysteria
i
thought
he
gone
to
the
dentist
whispered
constance
povey
toothache
had
been
causing
anxiety
in
the
microcosm
for
two
days
and
it
had
been
clearly
understood
at
dinner
that
thursday
morning
that
povey
was
to
set
forth
to
oulsnam
the
dentists
at
hillport
without
any
delay
only
on
thursdays
and
sundays
did
povey
dine
with
the
family
on
other
days
he
dined
later
by
himself
but
at
the
family
table
when
baines
or
one
of
the
assistants
could
relieve
him
in
the
shop
before
starting
out
to
visit
her
elder
sister
at
axe
baines
had
insisted
to
povey
that
he
had
eaten
practically
nothing
but
slops
for
hours
and
that
if
he
was
not
careful
she
would
have
him
on
her
hands
he
had
replied
in
his
quietest
most
sagacious
tone
the
tone
that
carried
weight
with
all
who
heard
it
that
he
had
only
been
waiting
for
thursday
afternoon
and
should
of
course
go
instantly
to
oulsnams
and
have
the
thing
attended
to
in
a
proper
manner
he
had
even
added
that
persons
who
put
off
going
to
the
dentist
were
simply
sowing
trouble
for
themselves
none
could
possibly
have
guessed
that
povey
was
afraid
of
going
to
the
dentist
but
such
was
the
case
he
had
not
dared
to
set
forth
the
paragon
of
commonsense
pictured
by
most
people
as
being
somehow
unliable
to
human
frailties
could
not
yet
screw
himself
up
to
the
point
of
ringing
a
dentist
he
did
look
funny
said
sophia
i
wonder
what
he
thought
i
help
laughing
constance
made
no
answer
but
when
sophia
had
resumed
her
own
clothes
and
it
was
ascertained
beyond
doubt
that
the
new
dress
had
not
suffered
and
constance
herself
was
calmly
stitching
again
she
said
poising
her
needle
as
she
had
poised
it
to
watch
sophia
i
was
just
wondering
whether
something
ought
to
be
done
for
mr
povey
what
sophia
demanded
has
he
gone
back
to
his
bedroom
let
go
and
listen
said
sophia
the
adventuress
they
went
through
the
showroom
door
past
the
foot
of
the
stairs
leading
to
the
second
storey
down
the
long
corridor
broken
in
the
middle
by
two
steps
and
carpeted
with
a
narrow
bordered
carpet
whose
parallel
lines
increased
its
apparent
length
they
went
on
tiptoe
sticking
close
to
one
another
povey
door
was
slightly
ajar
they
listened
not
a
sound
mr
povey
constance
coughed
discreetly
no
reply
it
was
sophia
who
pushed
the
door
open
constance
made
an
elderly
prim
plucking
gesture
at
sophia
bare
arm
but
she
followed
sophia
gingerly
into
the
forbidden
room
which
was
however
empty
the
bed
had
been
ruffled
and
on
it
lay
a
book
the
harvest
of
a
quiet
eye
harvest
of
a
quiet
tooth
sophia
whispered
giggling
very
low
hsh
constance
put
her
lips
forward
from
the
next
room
came
a
regular
muffled
oratorical
sound
as
though
some
one
had
begun
many
years
ago
to
address
a
meeting
and
had
forgotten
to
leave
off
and
never
would
leave
off
they
were
familiar
with
the
sound
and
they
quitted
povey
chamber
in
fear
of
disturbing
it
at
the
same
moment
povey
reappeared
this
time
in
the
doorway
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
long
corridor
he
seemed
to
be
trying
ineffectually
to
flee
from
his
tooth
as
a
murderer
tries
to
flee
from
his
conscience
oh
mr
povey
said
constance
quickly
for
he
had
surprised
them
coming
out
of
his
bedroom
we
were
just
looking
for
you
to
see
if
we
could
do
anything
for
you
sophia
added
oh
no
thanks
said
povey
then
he
began
to
come
down
the
corridor
slowly
you
have
been
to
the
dentist
said
constance
sympathetically
no
i
have
said
povey
as
if
constance
was
indicating
a
fact
which
had
escaped
his
attention
the
truth
is
i
thought
it
looked
like
rain
and
if
i
got
wet
you
see
miserable
povey
yes
said
constance
you
certainly
ought
to
keep
out
of
draughts
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
you
went
and
sat
in
the
parlour
there
a
fire
there
i
shall
be
all
right
thank
you
said
povey
and
after
a
pause
well
thanks
i
will
iii
the
girls
made
way
for
him
to
pass
them
at
the
head
of
the
twisting
stairs
which
led
down
to
the
parlour
constance
followed
and
sophia
followed
constance
have
father
chair
said
constance
there
were
two
with
fluted
backs
covered
by
antimacassars
one
on
either
side
of
the
hearth
that
to
the
left
was
still
entitled
father
chair
though
its
owner
had
not
sat
in
it
since
long
before
the
crimean
war
and
would
never
sit
in
it
again
i
think
i
sooner
have
the
other
one
said
povey
because
on
the
right
side
you
see
and
he
touched
his
right
cheek
having
taken
baines
chair
he
bent
his
face
down
to
the
fire
seeking
comfort
from
its
warmth
sophia
poked
the
fire
whereupon
povey
abruptly
withdrew
his
face
he
then
felt
something
light
on
his
shoulders
constance
had
taken
the
antimacassar
from
the
back
of
the
chair
and
protected
him
with
it
from
the
draughts
he
did
not
instantly
rebel
and
therefore
was
permanently
barred
from
rebellion
he
was
entrapped
by
the
antimacassar
it
formally
constituted
him
an
invalid
and
constance
and
sophia
his
nurses
constance
drew
the
curtain
across
the
street
door
no
draught
could
come
from
the
window
for
the
window
was
not
to
open
the
age
of
ventilation
had
not
arrived
sophia
shut
the
other
two
doors
and
each
near
a
door
the
girls
gazed
at
povey
behind
his
back
irresolute
but
filled
with
a
delicious
sense
of
responsibility
the
situation
was
on
a
different
plane
now
the
seriousness
of
povey
toothache
which
became
more
and
more
manifest
had
already
wiped
out
the
ludicrous
memory
of
the
encounter
in
the
showroom
looking
at
these
two
big
girls
with
their
black
frocks
and
black
aprons
and
their
smooth
hair
and
their
composed
serious
faces
one
would
have
judged
them
incapable
of
the
least
lapse
from
an
archangelic
primness
sophia
especially
presented
a
marvellous
imitation
of
saintly
innocence
as
for
the
toothache
its
action
on
povey
was
apparently
periodic
it
gathered
to
a
crisis
like
a
wave
gradually
the
torture
increasing
till
the
wave
broke
and
left
povey
exhausted
but
free
for
a
moment
from
pain
these
crises
recurred
about
once
a
minute
and
now
accustomed
to
the
presence
of
the
young
virgins
and
having
tacitly
acknowledged
by
his
acceptance
of
the
antimacassar
that
his
state
was
abnormal
he
gave
himself
up
frankly
to
affliction
he
concealed
nothing
of
his
agony
which
was
fully
displayed
by
sudden
contortions
of
his
frame
and
frantic
oscillations
of
the
presently
as
he
lay
back
enfeebled
in
the
wash
of
a
spent
wave
he
murmured
with
a
sick
man
voice
i
suppose
you
have
got
any
laudanum
the
girls
started
into
life
laudanum
mr
povey
yes
to
hold
in
my
mouth
he
sat
up
tense
another
wave
was
forming
the
excellent
fellow
was
lost
to
all
all
decency
there
sure
to
be
some
in
mother
cupboard
said
sophia
constance
who
bore
baines
bunch
of
keys
at
her
girdle
a
solemn
trust
moved
a
little
fearfully
to
a
corner
cupboard
which
was
hung
in
the
angle
to
the
right
of
the
projecting
fireplace
over
a
shelf
on
which
stood
a
large
copper
that
corner
cupboard
of
oak
inlaid
with
maple
and
ebony
in
a
simple
border
pattern
was
typical
of
the
room
it
was
of
a
piece
with
the
deep
green
flock
wall
paper
and
the
and
the
with
their
antimacassars
and
the
harmonium
in
rosewood
with
a
chinese
on
the
top
of
it
even
with
the
carpet
certainly
the
most
curious
parlour
carpet
that
ever
was
being
made
of
lengths
of
the
sewn
together
side
by
side
that
corner
cupboard
was
already
old
in
service
it
had
held
the
medicines
of
generations
it
gleamed
darkly
with
the
grave
and
genuine
polish
which
comes
from
ancient
use
alone
the
key
which
constance
chose
from
her
bunch
was
like
the
cupboard
smooth
and
shining
with
years
it
fitted
and
turned
very
easily
yet
with
a
firm
snap
the
single
wide
door
opened
sedately
as
a
portal
the
girls
examined
the
sacred
interior
which
had
the
air
of
being
inhabited
by
an
army
of
diminutive
prisoners
each
crying
aloud
with
the
full
strength
of
its
label
to
be
set
free
on
a
mission
there
it
is
said
sophia
eagerly
and
there
it
was
a
blue
bottle
with
a
saffron
label
caution
poison
laudanum
charles
critchlow
dispensing
chemist
luke
square
bursley
those
large
capitals
frightened
the
girls
constance
took
the
bottle
as
she
might
have
taken
a
loaded
revolver
and
she
glanced
at
sophia
their
omnipotent
mother
was
not
present
to
tell
them
what
to
do
they
who
had
never
decided
had
to
decide
now
and
constance
was
the
elder
must
this
fearsome
stuff
whose
very
name
was
a
name
of
fear
be
introduced
in
spite
of
printed
warnings
into
mouth
the
responsibility
was
terrifying
perhaps
i
just
better
ask
critchlow
constance
faltered
the
expectation
of
beneficent
laudanum
had
enlivened
povey
had
already
indeed
by
a
sort
of
suggestion
half
cured
his
toothache
oh
no
he
said
no
need
to
ask
critchlow
two
or
three
drops
in
a
little
water
he
showed
impatience
to
be
at
the
laudanum
the
girls
knew
that
an
antipathy
existed
between
the
chemist
and
povey
it
sure
to
be
all
right
said
sophia
i
get
the
water
with
youthful
cries
and
alarms
they
succeeded
in
pouring
four
mortal
dark
drops
one
more
than
constance
intended
into
a
cup
containing
a
little
water
and
as
they
handed
the
cup
to
povey
their
faces
were
the
faces
of
affrighted
comical
conspirators
they
felt
so
old
and
they
looked
so
young
povey
imbibed
eagerly
of
the
potion
put
the
cup
on
the
mantelpiece
and
then
tilted
his
head
to
the
right
so
as
to
submerge
the
affected
tooth
in
this
posture
he
remained
awaiting
the
sweet
influence
of
the
remedy
the
girls
out
of
a
nice
modesty
turned
away
for
povey
must
not
swallow
the
medicine
and
they
preferred
to
leave
him
unhampered
in
the
solution
of
a
delicate
problem
when
next
they
examined
him
he
was
leaning
back
in
the
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
eyes
shut
has
it
done
you
any
good
mr
povey
i
think
i
lie
down
on
the
sofa
for
a
minute
was
strange
reply
and
forthwith
he
sprang
up
and
flung
himself
on
to
the
sofa
between
the
fireplace
and
the
window
where
he
lay
stripped
of
all
his
dignity
a
mere
beaten
animal
in
a
grey
suit
with
peculiar
and
a
very
creased
waistcoat
and
a
lapel
that
was
planted
with
pins
and
a
paper
collar
and
paper
cuffs
constance
ran
after
him
with
the
antimacassar
which
she
spread
softly
on
his
shoulders
and
sophia
put
another
one
over
his
thin
little
legs
all
drawn
up
they
then
gazed
at
their
handiwork
with
secret
and
the
most
dreadful
misgivings
he
surely
never
swallowed
it
constance
whispered
he
asleep
anyhow
said
sophia
more
loudly
povey
was
certainly
asleep
and
his
mouth
was
very
wide
open
like
a
the
only
question
was
whether
his
sleep
was
not
an
eternal
sleep
the
only
question
was
whether
he
was
not
out
of
his
pain
for
ever
then
he
snored
horribly
his
snore
seemed
a
portent
of
disaster
sophia
approached
him
as
though
he
were
a
bomb
and
stared
growing
bolder
into
his
mouth
oh
con
she
summoned
her
sister
do
come
and
look
it
too
droll
in
an
instant
all
their
four
eyes
were
exploring
the
singular
landscape
of
povey
mouth
in
a
corner
to
the
right
of
that
interior
was
one
sizeable
fragment
of
a
tooth
that
was
attached
to
povey
by
the
slenderest
tie
so
that
at
each
respiration
of
povey
when
his
body
slightly
heaved
and
the
gale
moaned
in
the
cavern
this
tooth
moved
separately
showing
that
its
long
connection
with
povey
was
drawing
to
a
close
that
the
one
said
sophia
pointing
and
it
as
loose
as
anything
did
you
ever
see
such
a
funny
thing
the
extreme
funniness
of
the
thing
had
lulled
in
sophia
the
fear
of
povey
sudden
death
i
see
how
much
he
taken
said
constance
preoccupied
going
to
the
mantelpiece
why
i
do
believe
sophia
began
and
then
stopped
glancing
at
the
which
stood
next
to
the
sofa
it
was
a
howe
it
had
a
little
and
in
the
was
a
small
pair
of
pliers
constance
engaged
in
sniffing
at
the
lees
of
the
potion
in
order
to
estimate
its
probable
deadliness
heard
the
click
of
the
little
and
then
she
saw
sophia
nearing
povey
mouth
with
the
pliers
sophia
she
exclaimed
aghast
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
are
you
doing
nothing
said
sophia
the
next
instant
povey
sprang
up
out
of
his
laudanum
dream
it
jumps
he
muttered
and
after
a
reflective
pause
but
it
much
better
he
had
at
any
rate
escaped
death
sophia
right
hand
was
behind
her
back
just
then
a
hawker
passed
down
king
street
crying
mussels
and
cockles
oh
sophia
almost
shrieked
do
let
have
mussels
and
cockles
for
tea
and
she
rushed
to
the
door
and
unlocked
and
opened
it
regardless
of
the
risk
of
draughts
to
povey
in
those
days
people
often
depended
upon
the
caprices
of
hawkers
for
the
tastiness
of
their
teas
but
it
was
an
adventurous
age
when
errant
knights
of
commerce
were
numerous
and
enterprising
you
went
on
to
your
doorstep
caught
your
meal
as
it
passed
withdrew
cooked
it
and
ate
it
quite
in
the
manner
of
the
early
briton
constance
was
obliged
to
join
her
sister
on
the
top
step
sophia
descended
to
the
second
step
fresh
mussels
and
cockles
all
alive
oh
bawled
the
hawker
looking
across
the
road
in
the
april
breeze
he
was
the
celebrated
hollins
a
professional
irish
drunkard
aged
in
iniquity
who
cheerfully
saluted
magistrates
in
the
street
and
referred
to
the
workhouse
which
he
occasionally
visited
as
the
bastile
sophia
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
what
are
you
laughing
at
you
silly
thing
constance
demanded
sophia
surreptitiously
showed
the
pliers
which
she
had
partly
thrust
into
her
pocket
between
their
points
was
a
most
perceptible
and
even
recognizable
fragment
of
povey
this
was
the
crown
of
sophia
career
as
a
perpetrator
of
the
unutterable
what
constance
face
showed
the
final
contortions
of
that
horrified
incredulity
which
is
forced
to
believe
sophia
nudged
her
violently
to
remind
her
that
they
were
in
the
street
and
also
quite
close
to
povey
now
my
little
missies
said
the
vile
hollins
three
pence
a
pint
and
how
your
honoured
mother
yes
fresh
so
help

god
chapter
ii
the
tooth
i
the
two
girls
came
up
the
unlighted
stone
staircase
which
led
from
maggie
cave
to
the
door
of
the
parlour
sophia
foremost
was
carrying
a
large
tray
and
constance
a
small
one
constance
who
had
nothing
on
her
tray
but
a
teapot
a
bowl
of
steaming
and
mussels
and
cockles
and
a
plate
of
hot
buttered
toast
went
directly
into
the
parlour
on
the
left
sophia
had
in
her
arms
the
entire
material
and
apparatus
of
a
high
tea
for
two
including
eggs
jam
and
toast
covered
with
the
turned
upside
down
but
not
including
mussels
and
cockles
she
turned
to
the
right
passed
along
the
corridor
by
the
room
up
two
steps
into
the
sheeted
and
shuttered
gloom
of
the
closed
shop
up
the
showroom
stairs
through
the
showroom
and
so
into
the
bedroom
corridor
experience
had
proved
it
easier
to
make
this
long
detour
than
to
round
the
difficult
corner
of
the
parlour
stairs
with
a
large
loaded
tray
sophia
knocked
with
the
edge
of
the
tray
at
the
door
of
the
principal
bedroom
the
muffled
oratorical
sound
from
within
suddenly
ceased
and
the
door
was
opened
by
a
very
tall
very
thin
man
who
looked
down
at
sophia
as
if
to
demand
what
she
meant
by
such
an
interruption
i
brought
the
tea
critchlow
said
sophia
and
critchlow
carefully
accepted
the
tray
is
that
my
little
sophia
asked
a
faint
voice
from
the
depths
of
the
bedroom
yes
father
said
sophia
but
she
did
not
attempt
to
enter
the
room
critchlow
put
the
tray
on
a
chest
of
drawers
near
the
door
and
then
he
shut
the
door
with
no
ceremony
critchlow
was
john
baines
oldest
and
closest
friend
though
decidedly
younger
than
the
draper
he
frequently
popped
in
to
have
a
word
with
the
invalid
but
thursday
afternoon
was
his
special
afternoon
consecrated
by
him
to
the
service
of
the
sick
from
two
precisely
till
eight
precisely
he
took
charge
of
john
baines
reigning
autocratically
over
the
bedroom
it
was
known
that
he
would
not
tolerate
invasions
nor
even
ambassadorial
visits
no
he
gave
up
his
weekly
holiday
to
this
business
of
friendship
and
he
must
be
allowed
to
conduct
the
business
in
his
own
way
baines
herself
avoided
disturbing
critchlow
ministrations
on
her
husband
she
was
glad
to
do
so
for
baines
was
never
to
be
left
alone
under
any
circumstances
and
the
convenience
of
being
able
to
rely
upon
the
presence
of
a
staid
member
of
the
pharmaceutical
society
for
six
hours
of
a
given
day
every
week
outweighed
the
slight
affront
to
her
prerogatives
as
wife
and
critchlow
was
an
extremely
peculiar
man
but
when
he
was
in
the
bedroom
she
could
leave
the
house
with
an
easy
mind
moreover
john
baines
enjoyed
these
thursday
afternoons
for
him
there
was
like
charles
critchlow
the
two
old
friends
experienced
a
sort
of
grim
desiccated
happiness
cooped
up
together
in
the
bedroom
secure
from
women
and
fools
generally
how
they
spent
the
time
did
not
seem
to
be
certainly
known
but
the
impression
was
that
politics
occupied
them
undoubtedly
critchlow
was
an
extremely
peculiar
man
he
was
a
man
of
habits
he
must
always
have
the
same
things
for
his
tea
jam
for
instance
he
called
it
preserve
the
idea
of
offering
critchlow
a
tea
which
did
not
comprise
jam
was
inconceivable
by
the
intelligence
of
luke
square
thus
for
years
past
in
the
season
when
all
the
house
and
all
the
shop
smelt
richly
of
fruit
boiling
in
sugar
baines
had
filled
an
extra
number
of
jars
with
jam
critchlow
touch
any
other
sort
so
sophia
faced
with
the
shut
door
of
the
bedroom
went
down
to
the
parlour
by
the
shorter
route
she
knew
that
on
going
up
again
after
tea
she
would
find
the
devastated
tray
on
the
doormat
constance
was
helping
povey
to
mussels
and
cockles
and
povey
still
wore
one
of
the
antimacassars
it
must
have
stuck
to
his
shoulders
when
he
sprang
up
from
the
sofa
woollen
antimacassars
being
notoriously
parasitic
things
sophia
sat
down
somewhat
the
serious
constance
was
also
perturbed
povey
did
not
usually
take
tea
in
the
house
on
thursday
afternoons
his
practice
was
to
go
out
into
the
great
mysterious
world
never
before
had
he
shared
a
meal
with
the
girls
alone
the
situation
was
indubitably
unexpected
unforeseen
it
was
too
piquant
and
what
added
to
its
piquancy
was
the
fact
that
constance
and
sophia
were
somehow
responsible
for
povey
they
felt
that
they
were
responsible
for
him
they
had
offered
the
practical
sympathy
of
two
intelligent
and
young
women
born
nurses
by
reason
of
their
sex
and
povey
had
accepted
he
was
now
on
their
hands
sophia
monstrous
sly
operation
in
povey
mouth
did
not
cause
either
of
them
much
alarm
constance
having
apparently
recovered
from
the
first
shock
of
it
they
had
discussed
it
in
the
kitchen
while
preparing
the
teas
constance
extraordinarily
severe
and
dictatorial
tone
in
condemning
it
had
led
to
a
certain
heat
but
the
success
of
the
impudent
wrench
justified
it
despite
any
irrefutable
argument
to
the
contrary
povey
was
better
already
and
he
evidently
remained
in
ignorance
of
his
loss
have
some
constance
asked
of
sophia
with
a
large
spoon
hovering
over
the
bowl
of
shells
yes
please
said
sophia
positively
constance
well
knew
that
she
would
have
some
and
had
only
asked
from
sheer
nervousness
pass
your
plate
then
now
when
everybody
was
served
with
mussels
cockles
tea
and
toast
and
povey
had
been
persuaded
to
cut
the
crust
off
his
toast
and
constance
had
quite
unnecessarily
warned
sophia
against
the
deadly
green
stuff
in
the
mussels
and
constance
had
further
pointed
out
that
the
evenings
were
getting
longer
and
povey
had
agreed
that
they
were
there
remained
nothing
to
say
an
irksome
silence
fell
on
them
all
and
no
one
could
lift
it
off
tiny
clashes
of
shell
and
crockery
sounded
with
the
terrible
clearness
of
noises
heard
in
the
night
each
person
avoided
the
eyes
of
the
others
and
both
constance
and
sophia
kept
straightening
their
bodies
at
intervals
and
expanding
their
chests
and
then
looking
at
their
plates
occasionally
a
prim
cough
was
discharged
it
was
a
sad
example
of
the
difference
between
young
women
dreams
of
social
brilliance
and
the
reality
of
life
these
girls
got
more
and
more
girlish
until
from
being
women
at
the
administering
of
laudanum
they
sank
back
to
about
eight
years
of
age
perfect
children
at
the
the
tension
was
snapped
by
povey
my
god
he
muttered
moved
by
a
startling
discovery
to
this
impious
and
disgraceful
oath
he
the
pattern
and
exemplar
and
in
the
presence
of
innocent
girlhood
too
i
swallowed
it
swallowed
what
mr
povey
constance
inquired
the
tip
of
povey
tongue
made
a
careful
voyage
of
inspection
all
round
the
right
side
of
his
mouth
oh
yes
he
said
as
if
solemnly
accepting
the
inevitable
swallowed
it
sophia
face
was
now
scarlet
she
seemed
to
be
looking
for
some
place
to
hide
it
constance
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
that
tooth
has
been
loose
for
two
years
said
povey
and
now
i
swallowed
it
with
a
mussel
oh
mr
povey
constance
cried
in
confusion
and
added
there
one
good
thing
it
ca
hurt
you
any
more
now
oh
said
povey
it
was
that
tooth
that
was
hurting
me
an
old
stump
at
the
back
that
upset
me
so
this
last
day
or
two
i
wish
it
had
been
sophia
had
her
teacup
close
to
her
red
face
at
these
words
of
povey
her
cheeks
seemed
to
fill
out
like
plump
apples
she
dashed
the
cup
into
its
saucer
spilling
tea
recklessly
and
then
ran
from
the
room
with
stifled
snorts
sophia
constance
protested
i
must
just
sophia
incoherently
spluttered
in
the
doorway
i
shall
be
all
right
do
constance
who
had
risen
sat
down
again
ii
sophia
fled
along
the
passage
leading
to
the
shop
and
took
refuge
in
the
room
a
room
which
the
astonishing
architect
had
devised
upon
what
must
have
been
a
backyard
of
one
of
the
three
constituent
houses
it
was
lighted
from
its
roof
and
only
a
wooden
partition
eight
feet
high
separated
it
from
the
passage
here
sophia
gave
rein
to
her
feelings
she
laughed
and
cried
together
weeping
generously
into
her
handkerchief
and
wildly
giggling
in
a
hysteria
which
she
could
not
control
the
spectacle
of
povey
mourning
for
a
tooth
which
he
thought
he
had
swallowed
but
which
in
fact
lay
all
the
time
in
her
pocket
seemed
to
her
to
be
by
far
the
most
ridiculous
thing
that
had
ever
happened
or
could
happen
on
earth
it
utterly
overcame
her
and
when
she
fancied
that
she
had
exhausted
and
conquered
its
surpassing
ridiculousness
this
ridiculousness
seized
her
again
and
rolled
her
anew
in
depths
of
mad
trembling
laughter
gradually
she
grew
calmer
she
heard
the
parlour
door
open
and
constance
descend
the
kitchen
steps
with
a
rattling
tray
of
tea
then
was
finished
without
her
constance
did
not
remain
in
the
kitchen
because
the
cups
and
saucers
were
left
for
maggie
to
wash
up
as
a
fitting
coda
to
maggie
monthly
holiday
the
parlour
door
closed
and
the
vision
of
povey
in
his
antimacassar
swept
sophia
off
into
another
convulsion
of
laughter
and
tears
upon
this
the
parlour
door
opened
again
and
sophia
choked
herself
into
silence
while
constance
hastened
along
the
passage
in
a
minute
constance
returned
with
her
woolwork
which
she
had
got
from
the
showroom
and
the
parlour
received
her
not
the
least
curiosity
on
the
part
of
constance
as
to
what
had
become
of
sophia
at
length
sophia
a
faint
meditative
smile
being
all
that
was
left
of
the
storm
in
her
ascended
slowly
to
the
showroom
through
the
shop
nothing
there
of
interest
thence
she
wandered
towards
the
and
encountered
critchlow
tray
on
the
mat
she
picked
it
up
and
carried
it
by
way
of
the
showroom
and
shop
down
to
the
kitchen
where
she
dreamily
munched
two
pieces
of
toast
that
had
cooled
to
the
consistency
of
leather
she
mounted
the
stone
steps
and
listened
at
the
door
of
the
parlour
no
sound
this
seclusion
of
povey
and
constance
was
really
very
strange
she
roved
right
round
the
house
and
descended
creepingly
by
the
twisted
and
listened
intently
at
the
other
door
of
the
parlour
she
now
detected
a
faint
regular
snore
povey
a
prey
to
laudanum
and
mussels
was
sleeping
while
constance
worked
at
her
it
was
now
in
the
highest
degree
odd
this
seclusion
of
povey
and
constance
unlike
anything
in
sophia
experience
she
wanted
to
go
into
the
parlour
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
do
so
she
crept
away
again
forlorn
and
puzzled
and
next
discovered
herself
in
the
bedroom
which
she
shared
with
constance
at
the
top
of
the
house
she
lay
down
in
the
dusk
on
the
bed
and
began
to
read
the
days
of
bruce
but
she
read
only
with
her
eyes
later
she
heard
movements
on
the
and
the
familiar
whining
creak
of
the
door
at
the
foot
thereof
she
skipped
lightly
to
the
door
of
the
bedroom
povey
i
hope
you
be
able
to
sleep
constance
voice
it
will
probably
come
on
again
povey
voice
pessimistic
then
the
shutting
of
doors
it
was
almost
dark
she
went
back
to
the
bed
expecting
a
visit
from
constance
but
a
clock
struck
eight
and
all
the
various
phenomena
connected
with
the
departure
of
critchlow
occurred
one
after
another
at
the
same
time
maggie
came
home
from
the
land
of
romance
then
long
silences
constance
was
now
immured
with
her
father
it
being
her
turn
to
nurse
maggie
was
washing
up
in
her
cave
and
povey
was
lost
to
sight
in
his
bedroom
then
sophia
heard
her
mother
lively
commanding
knock
on
the
king
street
door
dusk
had
definitely
yielded
to
black
night
in
the
bedroom
sophia
dozed
and
dreamed
when
she
awoke
her
ear
caught
the
sound
of
knocking
she
jumped
up
tiptoed
to
the
landing
and
looked
over
the
balustrade
whence
she
had
a
view
of
all
the
corridor
the
gas
had
been
lighted
through
the
round
aperture
at
the
top
of
the
porcelain
globe
she
could
see
the
wavering
flame
it
was
her
mother
still
bonneted
who
was
knocking
at
the
door
of
povey
room
constance
stood
in
the
doorway
of
her
parents
room
baines
knocked
twice
with
an
interval
and
then
said
to
constance
in
a
resonant
whisper
that
vibrated
up
the
corridor
he
seems
to
be
fast
asleep
i
better
not
disturb
him
but
suppose
he
wants
something
in
the
night
well
child
i
should
hear
him
moving
sleep
the
best
thing
for
him
baines
left
povey
to
the
effects
of
laudanum
and
came
along
the
corridor
she
was
a
stout
woman
all
black
stuff
and
gold
chain
and
her
skirt
more
than
filled
the
width
of
the
corridor
sophia
watched
her
habitual
heavy
mounting
gesture
as
she
climbed
the
two
steps
that
gave
variety
to
the
corridor
at
the
she
paused
and
putting
her
hand
to
the
tap
gazed
up
into
the
globe
where
sophia
she
demanded
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
gas
as
she
lowered
the
flame
i
think
she
must
be
in
bed
mother
said
constance
nonchalantly
the
returned
mistress
was
point
by
point
resuming
knowledge
and
control
of
that
complicated
machine
her
household
then
constance
and
her
mother
disappeared
into
the
bedroom
and
the
door
was
shut
with
a
gentle
decisive
bang
that
to
the
silent
watcher
on
the
floor
above
seemed
to
create
a
special
excluding
intimacy
round
about
the
figures
of
constance
and
her
father
and
mother
the
watcher
wondered
with
a
little
prick
of
jealousy
what
they
would
be
discussing
in
the
large
bedroom
her
father
beard
wagging
feebly
and
his
long
arms
on
the
counterpane
constance
perched
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
her
mother
walking
to
and
fro
putting
her
cameo
brooch
on
the
or
stretching
creases
out
of
her
gloves
certainly
in
some
subtle
way
constance
had
a
standing
with
her
parents
which
was
more
confidential
than
sophia
iii
when
constance
came
to
bed
half
an
hour
later
sophia
was
already
in
bed
the
room
was
fairly
spacious
it
had
been
the
girls
retreat
and
fortress
since
their
earliest
years
its
features
seemed
to
them
as
natural
and
unalterable
as
the
features
of
a
cave
to
a
it
had
been
repapered
twice
in
their
lives
and
each
papering
stood
out
in
their
memories
like
an
epoch
a
third
epoch
was
due
to
the
replacing
of
a
drugget
by
a
resplendent
old
carpet
degraded
from
the
there
was
only
one
bed
the
bedstead
being
of
painted
iron
they
never
interfered
with
each
other
in
that
bed
sleeping
with
a
detachment
as
perfect
as
if
they
had
slept
on
opposite
sides
of
luke
square
yet
if
constance
had
one
night
lain
down
on
the
half
near
the
window
instead
of
on
the
half
near
the
door
the
secret
nature
of
the
universe
would
have
seemed
to
be
altered
the
small
was
filled
with
a
mass
of
shavings
of
silver
paper
now
the
rare
illnesses
which
they
had
suffered
were
recalled
chiefly
as
periods
when
that
silver
paper
was
crammed
into
a
large
which
hung
by
the
mantelpiece
and
a
fire
of
coals
unnaturally
reigned
in
its
place
the
silver
paper
was
part
of
the
order
of
the
world
the
sash
of
the
window
would
not
work
quite
properly
owing
to
a
slight
subsidence
in
the
wall
and
even
when
the
window
was
fastened
there
was
always
a
narrow
slit
to
the
left
hand
between
the
window
and
its
frame
through
this
slit
came
draughts
and
thus
very
keen
frosts
were
remembered
by
the
nights
when
baines
caused
the
sash
to
be
forced
and
kept
at
its
full
height
by
means
of
wedges
the
slit
of
exposure
was
part
of
the
order
of
the
world
they
possessed
only
one
bed
one
washstand
and
one
but
in
some
other
respects
they
were
rather
fortunate
girls
for
they
had
two
mahogany
wardrobes
this
mutual
independence
as
regards
wardrobes
was
due
partly
to
baines
strong
commonsense
and
partly
to
their
father
tendency
to
spoil
them
a
little
they
had
moreover
a
chest
of
drawers
with
a
curved
front
of
which
structure
constance
occupied
two
short
drawers
and
one
long
one
and
sophia
two
long
drawers
on
it
stood
two
fancy
in
which
each
sister
kept
jewellery
a
book
and
other
treasures
and
these
boxes
were
absolutely
sacred
to
their
respective
owners
they
were
different
but
one
was
not
more
magnificent
than
the
other
indeed
a
rigid
equality
was
the
rule
in
the
chamber
the
single
exception
being
that
behind
the
door
were
three
hooks
of
which
constance
commanded
two
well
sophia
began
when
constance
appeared
how
darling
mr
povey
she
was
lying
on
her
back
and
smiling
at
her
two
hands
which
she
held
up
in
front
of
her
asleep
said
constance
at
least
mother
thinks
so
she
says
sleep
is
the
best
thing
for
him
will
probably
come
on
again
said
sophia
what
that
you
say
constance
asked
undressing
will
probably
come
on
again
these
words
were
a
quotation
from
the
utterances
of
darling
povey
on
the
stairs
and
sophia
delivered
them
with
an
exact
imitation
of
povey
vocal
mannerism
sophia
said
constance
firmly
approaching
the
bed
i
wish
you
would
be
so
silly
she
had
benevolently
ignored
the
satirical
note
in
sophia
first
remark
but
a
strong
instinct
in
her
rose
up
and
objected
to
further
derision
surely
you
done
enough
for
one
day
she
added
for
answer
sophia
exploded
into
violent
laughter
which
she
made
no
attempt
to
control
she
laughed
too
long
and
too
freely
while
constance
stared
at
her
do
know
what
come
over
you
said
constance
it
only
because
i
ca
look
at
it
without
simply
going
off
into
fits
sophia
gasped
out
and
she
held
up
a
tiny
object
in
her
left
hand
constance
started
flushing
you
do
mean
to
say
you
kept
it
she
protested
earnestly
how
horrid
you
are
sophia
give
it
me
at
once
and
let
me
throw
it
away
i
never
heard
of
such
doings
now
give
it
me
no
sophia
objected
still
laughing
i
would
part
with
it
for
worlds
it
too
lovely
she
had
laughed
away
all
her
secret
resentment
against
constance
for
having
ignored
her
during
the
whole
evening
and
for
being
on
such
intimate
terms
with
their
parents
and
she
was
ready
to
be
candidly
jolly
with
constance
give
it
me
said
constance
doggedly
sophia
hid
her
hand
under
the
clothes
you
can
have
his
old
stump
when
it
comes
out
if
you
like
but
not
this
what
a
pity
it
the
wrong
one
sophia
i
ashamed
of
you
give
it
me
then
it
was
that
sophia
first
perceived
constance
extreme
seriousness
she
was
surprised
and
a
little
intimidated
by
it
for
the
expression
of
constance
face
usually
so
benign
and
calm
was
harsh
almost
fierce
however
sophia
had
a
great
deal
of
what
is
called
spirit
and
not
even
ferocity
on
the
face
of
mild
constance
could
intimidate
her
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
her
gaiety
expired
and
her
teeth
were
hidden
i
said
nothing
to
mother
constance
proceeded
i
should
hope
you
have
sophia
put
in
tersely
but
i
certainly
shall
if
you
do
throw
that
away
constance
finished
you
can
say
what
you
like
sophia
retorted
adding
contemptuously
a
term
of
opprobrium
which
has
long
since
passed
out
of
use
cant
will
you
give
it
me
or
wo
you
no
it
was
a
battle
suddenly
engaged
in
the
bedroom
the
atmosphere
had
altered
completely
with
the
swiftness
of
magic
the
beauty
of
sophia
the
angelic
tenderness
of
constance
and
the
youthful
naive
innocent
charm
of
both
of
them
were
transformed
into
something
sinister
and
cruel
sophia
lay
back
on
the
pillow
amid
her
hair
and
gazed
with
relentless
defiance
into
the
angry
eyes
of
constance
who
stood
threatening
by
the
bed
they
could
hear
the
gas
singing
over
the
and
their
hearts
beating
the
blood
wildly
in
their
veins
they
ceased
to
be
young
without
growing
old
the
eternal
had
leapt
up
in
them
from
its
sleep
constance
walked
away
from
the
bed
to
the
and
began
to
loose
her
hair
and
brush
it
holding
back
her
head
shaking
it
and
bending
forward
in
the
changeless
gesture
of
that
rite
she
was
so
disturbed
that
she
had
unconsciously
reversed
the
customary
order
of
the
toilette
after
a
moment
sophia
slipped
out
of
bed
and
stepping
with
her
bare
feet
to
the
chest
of
drawers
opened
her
and
deposited
the
fragment
of
povey
therein
she
dropped
the
lid
with
an
uncompromising
bang
as
if
to
say
we
shall
see
if
i
am
to
be
trod
upon
miss
their
eyes
met
again
in
the
then
sophia
got
back
into
bed
five
minutes
later
when
her
hair
was
quite
finished
constance
knelt
down
and
said
her
prayers
having
said
her
prayers
she
went
straight
to
sophia
opened
it
seized
the
fragment
of
povey
ran
to
the
window
and
frantically
pushed
the
fragment
through
the
slit
into
the
square
there
she
exclaimed
nervously
she
had
accomplished
this
inconceivable
transgression
of
the
code
of
honour
beyond
all
undoing
before
sophia
could
recover
from
the
stupefaction
of
seeing
her
sacred
impudently
violated
in
a
single
moment
one
of
sophia
chief
ideals
had
been
smashed
utterly
and
that
by
the
sweetest
gentlest
creature
she
had
ever
known
it
was
a
revealing
experience
for
sophia
and
also
for
constance
and
it
frightened
them
equally
sophia
staring
at
the
text
thou
god
seest
me
framed
in
straw
over
the
chest
of
drawers
did
not
stir
she
was
defeated
and
so
profoundly
moved
in
her
defeat
that
she
did
not
even
reflect
upon
the
obvious
inefficacy
of
illuminated
texts
as
a
deterrent
from
not
that
she
cared
a
fig
for
the
fragment
of
povey
it
was
the
moral
aspect
of
the
affair
and
the
astounding
inexplicable
development
in
constance
character
that
staggered
her
into
silent
acceptance
of
the
inevitable
constance
trembling
took
pains
to
finish
undressing
with
dignified
deliberation
sophia
behaviour
under
the
blow
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
but
it
gave
her
courage
at
length
she
turned
out
the
gas
and
lay
down
by
sophia
and
there
was
a
little
shuffling
and
then
stillness
for
a
while
and
if
you
want
to
know
said
constance
in
a
tone
that
mingled
amicableness
with
righteousness
mother
decided
with
aunt
harriet
that
we
are
both
to
leave
school
next
term
chapter
iii
a
battle
i
the
day
sanctioned
by
custom
in
the
five
towns
for
the
making
of
pastry
is
saturday
but
baines
made
her
pastry
on
friday
because
saturday
afternoon
was
of
course
a
busy
time
in
the
shop
it
is
true
that
baines
made
her
pastry
in
the
morning
and
that
saturday
morning
in
the
shop
was
scarcely
different
from
any
other
morning
nevertheless
baines
made
her
pastry
on
friday
morning
instead
of
saturday
morning
because
saturday
afternoon
was
a
busy
time
in
the
shop
she
was
thus
free
to
do
her
marketing
without
flurry
on
saturday
morning
on
the
morning
after
sophia
first
essay
in
dentistry
therefore
baines
was
making
her
pastry
in
the
underground
kitchen
this
kitchen
maggie
had
the
mystery
of
a
church
and
on
dark
days
it
had
the
mystery
of
a
crypt
the
stone
steps
leading
down
to
it
from
the
level
of
earth
were
quite
unlighted
you
felt
for
them
with
the
feet
of
faith
and
when
you
arrived
in
the
kitchen
the
kitchen
by
contrast
seemed
luminous
and
gay
the
architect
may
have
considered
and
intended
this
effect
of
the
staircase
the
kitchen
saw
day
through
a
wide
shallow
window
whose
top
touched
the
ceiling
and
whose
bottom
had
been
out
of
the
girls
reach
until
long
after
they
had
begun
to
go
to
school
its
panes
were
small
and
about
half
of
them
were
of
the
knot
kind
through
which
no
object
could
be
distinguished
the
other
half
were
of
a
later
date
and
stood
for
the
march
of
civilization
the
view
from
the
window
consisted
of
the
vast
windows
of
the
newly
built
sun
vaults
and
of
passing
legs
and
skirts
a
strong
wire
grating
prevented
any
excess
of
illumination
and
also
protected
the
glass
from
the
caprices
of
wayfarers
in
king
street
boys
had
a
habit
of
stopping
to
kick
with
their
full
strength
at
the
grating
on
a
brown
field
ornamented
the
walls
of
the
kitchen
its
ceiling
was
irregular
and
grimy
and
a
beam
ran
across
it
in
this
beam
were
two
hooks
from
these
hooks
had
once
depended
the
ropes
of
a
swing
much
used
by
constance
and
sophia
in
the
old
days
before
they
were
grown
up
a
large
range
stood
out
from
the
wall
between
the
stairs
and
the
window
the
rest
of
the
furniture
comprised
a
table
against
the
wall
opposite
the
range
a
cupboard
and
two
windsor
chairs
opposite
the
foot
of
the
steps
was
a
doorway
without
a
door
leading
to
two
larders
dimmer
even
than
the
kitchen
vague
retreats
made
visible
by
whitewash
where
bowls
of
milk
dishes
of
cold
bones
and
remainders
of
reposed
on
stillages
in
the
corner
nearest
the
kitchen
was
a
great
steen
in
which
the
bread
was
kept
another
doorway
on
the
other
side
of
the
kitchen
led
to
the
first
where
was
also
the
slopstone
and
tap
and
thence
a
tunnel
took
you
to
the
second
where
coke
and
ashes
were
stored
the
tunnel
proceeded
to
a
distant
infinitesimal
yard
and
from
the
yard
by
ways
behind
critchlow
shop
you
could
finally
emerge
astonished
upon
brougham
street
the
sense
of
the
of
those
regions
which
began
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
steps
and
ended
in
black
corners
of
larders
or
abruptly
in
the
common
dailiness
of
brougham
street
a
sense
which
constance
and
sophia
had
acquired
in
infancy
remained
with
them
almost
unimpaired
as
they
grew
old
baines
wore
black
alpaca
shielded
by
a
white
apron
whose
string
drew
attention
to
the
amplitude
of
her
waist
her
sleeves
were
turned
up
and
her
hands
as
far
as
the
knuckles
covered
with
damp
flour
her
ageless
smooth
occupied
a
corner
of
the
table
and
near
it
were
her
butter
some
shredded
apples
sugar
and
other
things
those
rosy
hands
were
at
work
among
a
sticky
substance
in
a
large
white
bowl
mother
are
you
there
she
heard
a
voice
from
above
yes
my
chuck
footsteps
apparently
reluctant
and
hesitating
clinked
on
the
stairs
and
sophia
entered
the
kitchen
put
this
curl
straight
said
baines
lowering
her
head
slightly
and
holding
up
her
floured
hands
which
might
not
touch
anything
but
flour
thank
you
it
bothered
me
and
now
stand
out
of
my
light
in
a
hurry
i
must
get
into
the
shop
so
that
i
can
send
povey
off
to
the
dentist
what
is
constance
doing
helping
maggie
to
make
povey
bed
oh
though
fat
baines
was
a
comely
woman
with
fine
brown
hair
and
confidently
calm
eyes
that
indicated
her
belief
in
her
own
capacity
to
accomplish
whatever
she
could
be
called
on
to
accomplish
she
looked
neither
more
nor
less
than
her
age
which
was
she
was
not
a
native
of
the
district
having
been
culled
by
her
husband
from
the
moorland
town
of
axe
twelve
miles
off
like
nearly
all
women
who
settle
in
a
strange
land
upon
marriage
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
had
considered
herself
just
a
trifle
superior
to
the
strange
land
and
its
ways
this
feeling
confirmed
by
long
experience
had
never
left
her
it
was
this
feeling
which
induced
her
to
continue
making
her
own
pastry
with
two
thoroughly
trained
great
girls
in
the
house
constance
could
make
good
pastry
but
it
was
not
her
mother
pastry
in
everything
can
be
taught
except
the
hand
light
and
firm
which
wields
the
roller
one
is
born
with
this
hand
or
without
it
and
if
one
is
born
without
it
the
highest
flights
of
pastry
are
impossible
constance
was
born
without
it
there
were
days
when
sophia
seemed
to
possess
it
but
there
were
other
days
when
sophia
pastry
was
uneatable
by
any
one
except
maggie
thus
baines
though
intensely
proud
and
fond
of
her
daughters
had
justifiably
preserved
a
certain
condescension
towards
them
she
honestly
doubted
whether
either
of
them
would
develop
into
the
equal
of
their
mother
now
you
little
vixen
she
exclaimed
sophia
was
stealing
and
eating
slices
of
apple
this
comes
of
having
no
breakfast
and
why
did
you
come
down
to
supper
last
night
i
do
know
i
forgot
baines
scrutinized
the
child
eyes
which
met
hers
with
a
sort
of
diffident
boldness
she
knew
everything
that
a
mother
can
know
of
a
daughter
and
she
was
sure
that
sophia
had
no
cause
to
be
indisposed
therefore
she
scrutinized
those
eyes
with
a
faint
apprehension
if
you
ca
find
anything
better
to
do
said
she
butter
me
the
inside
of
this
dish
are
your
hands
clean
no
better
not
touch
it
baines
was
now
at
the
stage
of
depositing
little
pats
of
butter
in
rows
on
a
large
plain
of
paste
the
best
fresh
butter
cooking
butter
to
say
naught
of
lard
was
unknown
in
that
kitchen
on
friday
mornings
she
doubled
the
expanse
of
paste
on
itself
and
rolled
the
butter
in
supreme
operation
constance
has
told
you
about
leaving
school
said
baines
in
the
vein
of
as
she
trimmed
the
paste
to
the
shape
of
a
yes
sophia
replied
shortly
then
she
moved
away
from
the
table
to
the
range
there
was
a
on
the
rack
and
she
began
to
play
with
it
well
are
you
glad
your
aunt
harriet
thinks
you
are
quite
old
enough
to
leave
and
as
we
decided
in
any
case
that
constance
was
to
leave
it
really
much
simpler
that
you
should
both
leave
together
mother
said
sophia
rattling
the
what
am
i
going
to
do
after
i
left
school
i
hope
baines
answered
with
that
sententiousness
which
even
the
cleverest
of
parents
are
not
always
clever
enough
to
deny
themselves
i
hope
that
both
of
you
will
do
what
you
can
to
help
your
mother
and
father
she
added
yes
said
sophia
irritated
but
what
am
i
going
to
do
that
must
be
considered
as
constance
is
to
learn
the
millinery
been
thinking
that
you
might
begin
to
make
yourself
useful
in
the
underwear
gloves
silks
and
so
on
then
between
you
you
would
one
day
be
able
to
manage
quite
nicely
all
that
side
of
the
shop
and
i
should
be
i
do
want
to
go
into
the
shop
mother
this
interruption
was
made
in
a
voice
apparently
cold
and
inimical
but
sophia
trembled
with
nervous
excitement
as
she
uttered
the
words
baines
gave
a
brief
glance
at
her
unobserved
by
the
child
whose
face
was
towards
the
fire
she
deemed
herself
a
finished
expert
in
the
reading
of
sophia
moods
nevertheless
as
she
looked
at
that
straight
back
and
proud
head
she
had
no
suspicion
that
the
whole
essence
and
being
of
sophia
was
silently
but
intensely
imploring
sympathy
i
wish
you
would
be
quiet
with
that
fork
said
baines
with
the
curious
grim
politeness
which
often
characterized
her
relations
with
her
daughters
the
fell
on
the
brick
floor
after
having
rebounded
from
the
sophia
hurriedly
replaced
it
on
the
rack
then
what
shall
you
do
baines
proceeded
conquering
the
annoyance
caused
by
the
i
think
it
me
that
should
ask
you
instead
of
you
asking
me
what
shall
you
do
your
father
and
i
were
both
hoping
you
would
take
kindly
to
the
shop
and
try
to
repay
us
for
all
the
baines
was
unfortunate
in
her
phrasing
that
morning
she
happened
to
be
in
truth
rather
an
exceptional
parent
but
that
morning
she
seemed
unable
to
avoid
the
absurd
pretensions
which
parents
of
those
days
assumed
quite
sincerely
and
which
every
good
child
with
meekness
accepted
sophia
was
not
a
good
child
and
she
obstinately
denied
in
her
heart
the
cardinal
principle
of
family
life
namely
that
the
parent
has
conferred
on
the
offspring
a
supreme
favour
by
bringing
it
into
the
world
she
interrupted
her
mother
again
rudely
i
do
want
to
leave
school
at
all
she
said
passionately
but
you
will
have
to
leave
school
sooner
or
later
argued
baines
with
an
air
of
quiet
reasoning
of
putting
herself
on
a
level
with
sophia
you
ca
stay
at
school
for
ever
my
pet
can
you
out
of
my
way
she
hurried
across
the
kitchen
with
a
pie
which
she
whipped
into
the
oven
shutting
the
iron
door
with
a
careful
gesture
yes
said
sophia
i
should
like
to
be
a
teacher
that
what
i
want
to
be
the
tap
in
the
out
of
repair
could
be
heard
distinctly
and
systematically
dropping
water
into
a
jar
on
the
slopstone
a
inquired
baines
of
course
what
other
kind
is
there
said
sophia
sharply
with
miss
chetwynd
i
do
think
your
father
would
like
that
baines
replied
sure
he
would
like
it
why
not
it
would
be
quite
suitable
why
not
mother
the
girl
demanded
with
a
sort
of
ferocity
she
had
now
quitted
the
range
a
man
feet
twinkled
past
the
window
baines
was
startled
and
surprised
sophia
attitude
was
really
very
trying
her
manners
deserved
correction
but
it
was
not
these
phenomena
which
seriously
affected
baines
she
was
used
to
them
and
had
come
to
regard
them
as
somehow
the
inevitable
accompaniment
of
sophia
beauty
as
the
penalty
of
that
surpassing
charm
which
occasionally
emanated
from
the
girl
like
a
radiance
what
startled
and
surprised
baines
was
the
perfect
and
unthinkable
madness
of
sophia
infantile
scheme
it
was
a
revelation
to
baines
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
had
the
girl
taken
such
a
notion
into
her
head
orphans
widows
and
spinsters
of
a
certain
age
suddenly
thrown
on
the
world
these
were
the
women
who
naturally
became
teachers
because
they
had
to
become
something
but
that
the
daughter
of
comfortable
parents
surrounded
by
love
and
the
pleasures
of
an
excellent
home
should
wish
to
teach
in
a
school
was
beyond
the
horizons
of
baines
common
sense
comfortable
parents
of
who
have
a
difficulty
in
sympathizing
with
baines
should
picture
what
their
feelings
would
be
if
their
sophias
showed
a
rude
desire
to
adopt
the
vocation
of
chauffeur
it
would
take
you
too
much
away
from
home
said
baines
achieving
a
second
pie
she
spoke
softly
the
experience
of
being
sophia
mother
for
nearly
sixteen
years
had
not
been
lost
on
baines
and
though
she
was
now
discovering
dangers
in
sophia
erratic
temperament
she
kept
her
presence
of
mind
sufficiently
well
to
behave
with
diplomatic
smoothness
it
was
undoubtedly
humiliating
to
a
mother
to
be
forced
to
use
diplomacy
in
dealing
with
a
girl
in
short
sleeves
in
her
day
mothers
had
been
autocrats
but
sophia
was
sophia
what
if
it
did
sophia
curtly
demanded
and
there
no
opening
in
bursley
said
baines
miss
chetwynd
would
have
me
and
then
after
a
time
i
could
go
to
her
sister
her
sister
what
sister
her
sister
that
has
a
big
school
in
london
somewhere
baines
covered
her
unprecedented
emotions
by
gazing
into
the
oven
at
the
first
pie
the
pie
was
doing
well
under
all
the
circumstances
in
those
few
seconds
she
reflected
rapidly
and
decided
that
to
a
desperate
disease
a
desperate
remedy
must
be
applied
london
she
herself
had
never
been
further
than
manchester
london
a
time
no
diplomacy
would
be
misplaced
in
this
crisis
of
sophia
development
sophia
she
said
in
a
changed
and
solemn
voice
fronting
her
daughter
and
holding
away
from
her
apron
those
floured
ringed
hands
i
do
know
what
has
come
over
you
truly
i
do
your
father
and
i
are
prepared
to
put
up
with
a
certain
amount
but
the
line
must
be
drawn
the
fact
is
we
spoilt
you
and
instead
of
getting
better
as
you
grow
up
you
getting
worse
now
let
me
hear
no
more
of
this
please
i
wish
you
would
imitate
your
sister
a
little
more
of
course
if
you
wo
do
your
share
in
the
shop
no
one
can
make
you
if
you
choose
to
be
an
idler
about
the
house
we
shall
have
to
endure
it
we
can
only
advise
you
for
your
own
good
but
as
for
this
she
stopped
and
let
silence
speak
and
then
finished
let
me
hear
no
more
of
it
it
was
a
powerful
and
impressive
speech
enunciated
clearly
in
such
a
tone
as
baines
had
not
employed
since
dismissing
a
young
lady
assistant
five
years
ago
for
light
conduct
but
mother
a
commotion
of
pails
resounded
at
the
top
of
the
stone
steps
it
was
maggie
in
descent
from
the
bedrooms
now
the
baines
family
passed
its
life
in
doing
its
best
to
keep
its
affairs
to
itself
the
assumption
being
that
maggie
and
all
the
povey
possibly
excepted
were
obsessed
by
a
ravening
appetite
for
that
which
did
not
concern
them
therefore
the
voices
of
the
baineses
always
died
away
or
fell
to
a
hushed
mysterious
whisper
whenever
the
foot
of
the
eavesdropper
was
heard
baines
put
a
floured
finger
to
her
double
chin
that
will
do
said
she
with
finality
maggie
appeared
and
sophia
with
a
brusque
precipitation
of
herself
vanished
upstairs
ii
now
really
povey
this
is
not
like
you
said
baines
who
on
her
way
into
the
shop
had
discovered
the
indispensable
in
the
room
it
is
true
that
the
room
was
almost
povey
sanctum
whither
he
retired
from
time
to
time
to
cut
out
suits
of
clothes
and
odd
garments
for
the
tailoring
department
it
is
true
that
the
tailoring
department
flourished
with
orders
employing
several
tailors
who
crossed
legs
in
their
own
homes
and
that
appointments
were
continually
being
made
with
customers
for
in
that
room
but
these
considerations
did
not
affect
baines
attitude
of
disapproval
i
just
cutting
out
that
suit
for
the
minister
said
povey
the
reverend
murley
superintendent
of
the
wesleyan
methodist
circuit
called
on
baines
every
week
on
a
recent
visit
baines
had
remarked
that
the
parson
coat
was
ageing
into
green
and
had
commanded
that
a
new
suit
should
be
built
and
presented
to
murley
murley
who
had
a
genuine
mediaeval
passion
for
souls
and
who
spent
his
money
and
health
freely
in
gratifying
the
passion
had
accepted
the
offer
strictly
on
behalf
of
christ
and
had
carefully
explained
to
povey
christ
use
for
multifarious
pockets
i
see
you
are
said
baines
tartly
but
that
no
reason
why
you
should
be
without
a
coat
and
in
this
cold
room
too
you
with
toothache
the
fact
was
that
povey
always
doffed
his
coat
when
cutting
out
instead
of
a
coat
he
wore
a
my
tooth
does
hurt
me
said
he
sheepishly
dropping
the
great
scissors
and
picking
up
a
cake
of
chalk
fiddlesticks
said
baines
this
exclamation
shocked
povey
it
was
not
unknown
on
the
lips
of
baines
but
she
usually
reserved
it
for
members
of
her
own
sex
povey
could
not
recall
that
she
had
ever
applied
it
to
any
statement
of
his
what
the
matter
with
the
woman
he
thought
the
redness
of
her
face
did
not
help
him
to
answer
the
question
for
her
face
was
always
red
after
the
operations
of
friday
in
the
kitchen
you
men
are
all
alike
baines
continued
the
very
thought
of
the
dentist
cures
you
why
do
you
go
in
at
once
to
critchlow
and
have
it
out
like
a
man
critchlow
extracted
teeth
and
his
shop
sign
said
and
chemist
but
povey
had
his
views
i
make
no
account
of
critchlow
as
a
dentist
said
he
then
for
goodness
sake
go
up
to
oulsnam
when
i
ca
very
well
go
now
and
is
saturday
why
ca
you
go
now
well
of
course
i
could
go
now
he
admitted
let
me
advise
you
to
go
then
and
do
come
back
with
that
tooth
in
your
head
i
shall
be
having
you
laid
up
next
show
some
pluck
do
oh
pluck
he
protested
hurt
at
that
moment
constance
came
down
the
passage
singing
constance
my
pet
baines
called
yes
mother
she
put
her
head
into
the
room
oh
povey
was
assuming
his
coat
povey
is
going
to
the
dentist
yes
i
going
at
once
povey
confirmed
oh
i
so
glad
constance
exclaimed
her
face
expressed
a
pure
sympathy
uncomplicated
by
critical
sentiments
povey
rapidly
bathed
in
that
sympathy
and
then
decided
that
he
must
show
himself
a
man
of
oak
and
iron
it
always
best
to
get
these
things
done
with
said
he
with
stern
detachment
i
just
slip
my
overcoat
on
here
it
is
said
constance
quickly
povey
overcoat
and
hat
were
hung
on
a
hook
immediately
outside
the
room
in
the
passage
she
gave
him
the
overcoat
anxious
to
be
of
service
i
did
call
you
in
here
to
be
povey
valet
said
baines
to
herself
with
mild
grimness
and
aloud
i
ca
stay
in
the
shop
long
constance
but
you
can
be
there
ca
you
till
povey
comes
back
and
if
anything
happens
run
upstairs
and
tell
me
yes
mother
constance
eagerly
consented
she
hesitated
and
then
turned
to
obey
at
once
i
want
to
speak
to
you
first
my
pet
baines
stopped
her
and
her
tone
was
peculiar
charged
with
import
confidential
and
therefore
very
flattering
to
constance
i
think
i
go
out
by
the
said
povey
it
be
nearer
this
was
truth
he
would
save
about
ten
yards
in
two
miles
by
going
out
through
the
instead
of
through
the
shop
who
could
have
guessed
that
he
was
ashamed
to
be
seen
going
to
the
dentist
afraid
lest
if
he
went
through
the
shop
baines
might
follow
him
and
utter
some
remark
prejudicial
to
his
dignity
before
the
assistants
baines
could
have
guessed
and
did
you
wo
want
that
said
baines
dryly
as
povey
dragged
open
the
the
ends
of
the
forgotten
were
dangling
beneath
coat
and
overcoat
oh
povey
scowled
at
his
forgetfulness
i
put
it
in
its
place
said
constance
offering
to
receive
the
thank
you
said
povey
gravely
i
do
suppose
they
be
long
over
my
bit
of
a
job
he
added
with
a
difficult
miserable
smile
then
he
went
off
down
king
street
with
an
exterior
of
gay
briskness
and
dignified
joy
in
the
fine
may
morning
but
there
was
no
may
morning
in
his
cowardly
human
heart
hi
povey
cried
a
voice
from
the
square
but
povey
disregarded
all
appeals
he
had
put
his
hand
to
the
plough
and
he
would
not
look
back
hi
povey
useless
baines
and
constance
were
both
at
the
door
a
man
was
crossing
the
road
from
boulton
terrace
the
lofty
erection
of
new
shops
which
the
envious
rest
of
the
square
had
decided
to
call
showy
he
waved
a
hand
to
baines
who
kept
the
door
open
it
harrop
she
said
to
constance
i
should
be
surprised
if
that
baby
come
at
last
and
he
wanted
to
tell
mr
povey
constance
blushed
full
of
pride
povey
wife
of
our
povey
renowned
cousin
the
confectioner
and
baker
in
boulton
terrace
was
a
frequent
subject
of
discussion
in
the
baines
family
but
this
was
absolutely
the
first
time
that
baines
had
acknowledged
in
presence
of
constance
the
marked
and
growing
change
which
had
characterized
povey
condition
during
recent
months
such
frankness
on
the
part
of
her
mother
coming
after
the
decision
about
leaving
school
proved
indeed
that
constance
had
ceased
to
be
a
mere
girl
good
morning
doctor
the
doctor
who
carried
a
little
bag
and
wore
he
was
the
last
doctor
in
bursley
to
abandon
the
saddle
for
the
saluted
and
straightened
his
high
black
stock
morning
morning
missy
well
it
a
boy
what
yonder
asked
baines
indicating
the
confectioner
harrop
nodded
i
wanted
to
inform
him
said
he
jerking
his
shoulder
in
the
direction
of
the
swaggering
coward
what
did
i
tell
you
constance
said
baines
turning
to
her
daughter
constance
confusion
was
equal
to
her
pleasure
the
alert
doctor
had
halted
at
the
foot
of
the
two
steps
and
with
one
hand
in
the
pocket
of
his
breeches
he
gazed
up
smiling
out
of
little
eyes
at
the
ample
matron
and
the
slender
virgin
yes
he
said
been
up
most
of
th
night
difficult
difficult
it
all
right
i
hope
oh
yes
fine
child
fine
child
but
he
put
his
mother
to
some
trouble
for
all
that
nothing
fresh
this
time
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
indicate
baines
bedroom
no
said
baines
with
a
different
expression
keeps
cheerful
yes
good
a
very
good
morning
to
you
he
strode
off
towards
his
house
which
was
lower
down
the
street
i
hope
she
turn
over
a
new
leaf
now
observed
baines
to
constance
as
she
closed
the
door
constance
knew
that
her
mother
was
referring
to
the
confectioner
wife
she
gathered
that
the
hope
was
slight
in
the
extreme
what
did
you
want
to
speak
to
me
about
mother
she
asked
as
a
way
out
of
her
delicious
confusion
shut
that
door
baines
replied
pointing
to
the
door
which
led
to
the
passage
and
while
constance
obeyed
baines
herself
shut
the
she
then
said
in
a
low
guarded
voice
what
all
this
about
sophia
wanting
to
be
a
wanting
to
be
a
constance
repeated
in
tones
of
amazement
yes
has
she
said
anything
to
you
not
a
word
well
i
never
she
wants
to
keep
on
with
miss
chetwynd
and
be
a
teacher
baines
had
half
a
mind
to
add
that
sophia
had
mentioned
london
but
she
restrained
herself
there
are
some
things
which
one
can
not
bring
one
self
to
say
she
added
instead
of
going
into
the
shop
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
constance
murmured
brokenly
in
the
excess
of
her
astonishment
she
was
rolling
up
povey
neither
did
i
said
baines
and
shall
you
let
her
mother
neither
your
father
nor
i
would
ever
dream
of
it
baines
replied
with
calm
and
yet
terrible
decision
i
only
mentioned
it
to
you
because
i
thought
sophia
would
have
told
you
something
no
mother
as
constance
put
povey
neatly
away
in
its
drawer
under
the
counter
she
thought
how
serious
life
was
what
with
babies
and
sophias
she
was
very
proud
of
her
mother
confidence
in
her
this
simple
pride
filled
her
ardent
breast
with
a
most
agreeable
commotion
and
she
wanted
to
help
everybody
to
show
in
some
way
how
much
she
sympathized
with
and
loved
everybody
even
the
madness
of
sophia
did
not
weaken
her
longing
to
comfort
sophia
iii
that
afternoon
there
was
a
search
for
sophia
whom
no
one
had
seen
since
dinner
she
was
discovered
by
her
mother
sitting
alone
and
unoccupied
in
the
the
circumstance
was
in
itself
sufficiently
peculiar
for
on
weekdays
the
was
never
used
even
by
the
girls
during
their
holidays
except
for
the
purpose
of
playing
the
piano
however
baines
offered
no
comment
on
geographical
situation
nor
on
her
idleness
my
dear
she
said
standing
at
the
door
with
a
effort
to
behave
as
though
nothing
had
happened
will
you
come
and
sit
with
your
father
a
bit
yes
mother
answered
sophia
with
a
sort
of
cold
alacrity
sophia
is
coming
father
said
baines
at
the
open
door
of
the
bedroom
which
was
at
with
and
close
to
the
door
then
she
surged
swishing
along
the
corridor
and
went
into
the
showroom
whither
she
had
been
called
sophia
passed
to
the
bedroom
the
eternal
prison
of
john
baines
although
on
account
of
his
nervous
restlessness
baines
was
never
left
alone
it
was
not
a
part
of
the
usual
duty
of
the
girls
to
sit
with
him
the
person
who
undertook
the
main
portion
of
the
vigils
was
a
certain
aunt
maria
whom
the
girls
knew
to
be
not
a
real
aunt
not
a
powerful
effective
aunt
like
aunt
harriet
of
axe
but
a
poor
second
cousin
of
john
baines
one
of
those
necessitous
pitiful
relatives
who
so
often
make
life
difficult
for
a
great
family
in
a
small
town
the
existence
of
aunt
maria
after
being
rather
a
trial
to
the
baineses
had
for
twelve
years
past
developed
into
something
absolutely
providential
for
them
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
in
those
days
providence
was
still
busying
himself
with
everybody
affairs
and
foreseeing
the
future
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
thus
having
foreseen
that
john
baines
would
have
a
stroke
and
need
a
faithful
tireless
nurse
he
had
begun
fifty
years
in
advance
by
creating
aunt
maria
and
had
kept
her
carefully
in
misfortune
way
so
that
at
the
proper
moment
she
would
be
ready
to
cope
with
the
stroke
such
at
least
is
the
only
theory
which
will
explain
the
use
by
the
baineses
and
indeed
by
all
thinking
bursley
of
the
word
providential
in
connection
with
aunt
maria
she
was
a
shrivelled
little
woman
capable
of
sitting
twelve
hours
a
day
in
a
bedroom
and
thriving
on
the
regime
at
nights
she
went
home
to
her
little
cottage
in
brougham
street
she
had
her
thursday
afternoons
and
generally
her
sundays
and
during
the
school
vacations
she
was
supposed
to
come
only
when
she
felt
inclined
or
when
the
cleaning
of
her
cottage
permitted
her
to
come
hence
in
holiday
seasons
baines
weighed
more
heavily
on
his
household
than
at
other
times
and
his
nurses
relieved
each
other
according
to
the
contingencies
of
the
moment
rather
than
by
a
set
programme
of
hours
the
tragedy
in
ten
thousand
acts
of
which
that
bedroom
was
the
scene
almost
entirely
escaped
sophia
perception
as
it
did
constance
sophia
went
into
the
bedroom
as
though
it
were
a
mere
bedroom
with
its
majestic
mahogany
furniture
its
crimson
rep
curtains
edged
with
gold
and
its
white
heavily
tasselled
counterpane
she
was
aged
four
when
john
baines
had
suddenly
been
seized
with
giddiness
on
the
steps
of
his
shop
and
had
fallen
and
without
losing
consciousness
had
been
transformed
from
john
baines
into
a
curious
and
pathetic
survival
of
john
baines
she
had
no
notion
of
the
thrill
which
ran
through
the
town
on
that
night
when
it
was
known
that
john
baines
had
had
a
stroke
and
that
his
left
arm
and
left
leg
and
his
right
eyelid
were
paralyzed
and
that
the
active
member
of
the
local
board
the
orator
the
religious
worker
the
very
life
of
the
town
life
was
permanently
done
for
she
had
never
heard
of
the
crisis
through
which
her
mother
assisted
by
aunt
harriet
had
passed
and
out
of
which
she
had
triumphantly
emerged
she
was
not
yet
old
enough
even
to
suspect
it
she
possessed
only
the
vaguest
memory
of
her
father
before
he
had
finished
with
the
world
she
knew
him
simply
as
an
organism
on
a
bed
whose
left
side
was
wasted
whose
eyes
were
often
inflamed
whose
mouth
was
crooked
who
had
no
creases
from
the
nose
to
the
corners
of
the
mouth
like
other
people
who
experienced
difficulty
in
eating
because
the
food
would
somehow
get
between
his
gums
and
his
cheek
who
slept
a
great
deal
but
was
excessively
fidgety
while
awake
who
seemed
to
hear
what
was
said
to
him
a
long
time
after
it
was
uttered
as
if
the
sense
had
to
travel
miles
by
labyrinthine
passages
to
his
brain
and
who
talked
very
very
slowly
in
a
weak
trembling
voice
and
she
had
an
image
of
that
remote
brain
as
something
with
a
red
spot
on
it
for
once
constance
had
said
mother
why
did
father
have
a
stroke
and
baines
had
replied
it
was
a
haemorrhage
of
the
brain
my
dear
here
putting
a
thimbled
finger
on
a
particular
part
of
sophia
head
not
merely
had
constance
and
sophia
never
really
felt
their
tragedy
baines
herself
had
largely
lost
the
sense
of
it
such
is
the
effect
of
use
even
the
ruined
organism
only
remembered
fitfully
and
partially
that
it
had
once
been
john
baines
and
if
baines
had
not
by
the
habit
of
years
gradually
built
up
a
gigantic
fiction
that
the
organism
remained
ever
the
supreme
consultative
head
of
the
family
if
critchlow
had
not
obstinately
continued
to
treat
it
as
a
crony
the
mass
of
living
and
dead
nerves
on
the
rich
victorian
bedstead
would
have
been
of
no
more
account
than
some
aunt
maria
in
similar
case
these
two
persons
his
wife
and
his
friend
just
managed
to
keep
him
morally
alive
by
indefatigably
feeding
his
importance
and
his
dignity
the
feat
was
a
miracle
of
stubborn
splendidly
blind
devotion
and
incorrigible
pride
when
sophia
entered
the
room
the
paralytic
followed
her
with
his
nervous
gaze
until
she
had
sat
down
on
the
end
of
the
sofa
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
seemed
to
study
her
for
a
long
time
and
then
he
murmured
in
his
slow
enfeebled
irregular
voice
is
that
sophia
yes
father
she
answered
cheerfully
and
after
another
pause
the
old
man
said
ay
it
sophia
and
later
your
mother
said
she
should
send
ye
sophia
saw
that
this
was
one
of
his
bad
dull
days
he
had
occasionally
days
of
comparative
nimbleness
when
his
wits
seized
almost
easily
the
meanings
of
external
phenomena
presently
his
sallow
face
and
long
white
beard
began
to
slip
down
the
steep
slant
of
the
pillows
and
a
troubled
look
came
into
his
left
eye
sophia
rose
and
putting
her
hands
under
his
armpits
lifted
him
higher
in
the
bed
he
was
not
heavy
but
only
a
strong
girl
of
her
years
could
have
done
it
ay
he
muttered
that
it
that
it
and
with
his
controllable
right
hand
he
took
her
hand
as
she
stood
by
the
bed
she
was
so
young
and
fresh
such
an
incarnation
of
the
spirit
of
health
and
he
was
so
far
gone
in
decay
and
corruption
that
there
seemed
in
this
contact
of
body
with
body
something
unnatural
and
repulsive
but
sophia
did
not
so
feel
it
sophia
he
addressed
her
and
made
preparatory
noises
in
his
throat
while
she
waited
he
continued
after
an
interval
now
clutching
her
arm
your
been
telling
me
you
do
want
to
go
in
the
shop
she
turned
her
eyes
on
him
and
his
anxious
dim
gaze
met
hers
she
nodded
nay
sophia
he
mumbled
with
the
extreme
of
slowness
i
surprised
at
ye
trade
bad
bad
ye
know
trade
bad
he
was
still
clutching
her
arm
she
nodded
she
was
in
fact
aware
of
the
badness
of
trade
caused
by
a
vague
war
in
the
united
states
the
words
north
and
south
had
a
habit
of
recurring
in
the
conversation
of
adult
persons
that
was
all
she
knew
though
people
were
starving
in
the
five
towns
as
they
were
starving
in
manchester
there
your
mother
his
thought
struggled
on
like
an
aged
horse
over
a
hilly
road
there
your
mother
he
repeated
as
if
wishful
to
direct
sophia
attention
to
the
spectacle
of
her
mother
working
hard
con
constance
and
you
must
help
her
trade
bad
what
can
i
do
lying
here
the
heat
from
his
dry
fingers
was
warming
her
arm
she
wanted
to
move
but
she
could
not
have
withdrawn
her
arm
without
appearing
impatient
for
a
similar
reason
she
would
not
avert
her
glance
a
deepening
flush
increased
the
lustre
of
her
immature
loveliness
as
she
bent
over
him
but
though
it
was
so
close
he
did
not
feel
that
radiance
he
had
long
outlived
a
susceptibility
to
the
strange
influences
of
youth
and
beauty
teaching
he
muttered
nay
nay
i
canna
allow
that
then
his
white
beard
rose
at
the
tip
as
he
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
above
his
head
reflectively
you
understand
me
he
questioned
finally
she
nodded
again
he
loosed
her
arm
and
she
turned
away
she
could
not
have
spoken
glittering
tears
enriched
her
eyes
she
was
saddened
into
a
profound
and
sudden
grief
by
the
ridiculousness
of
the
scene
she
had
youth
physical
perfection
she
brimmed
with
energy
with
the
sense
of
vital
power
all
existence
lay
before
her
when
she
put
her
lips
together
she
felt
capable
of
outvying
no
matter
whom
in
fortitude
of
resolution
she
had
always
hated
the
shop
she
did
not
understand
how
her
mother
and
constance
could
bring
themselves
to
be
deferential
and
flattering
to
every
customer
that
entered
no
she
did
not
understand
it
but
her
mother
though
a
proud
woman
and
constance
seemed
to
practise
such
behaviour
so
naturally
so
unquestioningly
that
she
had
never
imparted
to
either
of
them
her
feelings
she
guessed
that
she
would
not
be
comprehended
but
long
ago
she
had
decided
that
she
would
never
go
into
the
shop
she
knew
that
she
would
be
expected
to
do
something
and
she
had
fixed
on
teaching
as
the
one
possibility
these
decisions
had
formed
part
of
her
inner
life
for
years
past
she
had
not
mentioned
them
being
secretive
and
scarcely
anxious
for
unpleasantness
but
she
had
been
slowly
preparing
herself
to
mention
them
the
extraordinary
announcement
that
she
was
to
leave
school
at
the
same
time
as
constance
had
taken
her
unawares
before
the
preparations
ripening
in
her
mind
were
complete
before
as
it
were
she
had
girded
up
her
loins
for
the
fray
she
had
been
caught
unready
and
the
opposing
forces
had
obtained
the
advantage
of
her
but
did
they
suppose
she
was
beaten
no
argument
from
her
mother
no
hearing
even
just
a
curt
and
haughty
me
hear
no
more
of
this
and
so
the
great
desire
of
her
life
nourished
year
after
year
in
her
inmost
bosom
was
to
be
flouted
and
sacrificed
with
a
word
her
mother
did
not
appear
ridiculous
in
the
affair
for
her
mother
was
a
genuine
power
commanding
by
turns
genuine
love
and
genuine
hate
and
always
till
then
obedience
and
the
respect
of
reason
it
was
her
father
who
appeared
tragically
ridiculous
and
in
turn
the
whole
movement
against
her
grew
grotesque
in
its
absurdity
here
was
this
antique
wreck
helpless
useless
powerless
merely
pathetic
actually
thinking
that
he
had
only
to
mumble
in
order
to
make
her
he
knew
nothing
he
perceived
nothing
he
was
a
ferocious
egoist
like
most
bedridden
invalids
out
of
touch
with
life
and
he
thought
himself
justified
in
making
destinies
and
capable
of
making
them
sophia
could
not
perhaps
define
the
feelings
which
overwhelmed
her
but
she
was
conscious
of
their
tendency
they
aged
her
by
years
they
aged
her
so
that
in
a
kind
of
momentary
ecstasy
of
insight
she
felt
older
than
her
father
himself
you
will
be
a
good
girl
he
said
i
sure
o
that
it
was
too
painful
the
grotesqueness
of
her
father
complacency
humiliated
her
past
bearing
she
was
humiliated
not
for
herself
but
for
him
singular
creature
she
ran
out
of
the
room
fortunately
constance
was
passing
in
the
corridor
otherwise
sophia
had
been
found
guilty
of
a
great
breach
of
duty
go
to
father
she
whispered
hysterically
to
constance
and
fled
upwards
to
the
second
floor
iv
at
supper
with
her
red
downcast
eyes
she
had
returned
to
sheer
girlishness
again
overawed
by
her
mother
the
meal
had
an
unusual
aspect
povey
safe
from
the
dentist
but
having
lost
two
teeth
in
two
days
was
being
fed
on
bread
and
milk
to
wit
he
sat
near
the
fire
the
others
had
cold
pork
half
a
cold
and
cheese
but
sophia
only
pretended
to
eat
each
time
she
tried
to
swallow
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
her
throat
shut
itself
up
baines
and
constance
had
a
too
careful
air
of
eating
just
as
usual
baines
handsome
ringlets
dominated
the
table
under
the
gas
i
not
so
set
up
with
my
pastry
observed
baines
critically
munching
a
fragment
of
she
rang
a
little
maggie
appeared
from
the
cave
she
wore
a
plain
white
apron
but
no
cap
maggie
will
you
have
some
pie
yes
if
you
can
spare
it
this
was
maggie
customary
answer
to
offers
of
food
we
can
always
spare
it
maggie
said
her
mistress
as
usual
sophia
if
you
are
going
to
use
that
plate
give
it
to
me
maggie
disappeared
with
liberal
pie
baines
then
talked
to
povey
about
his
condition
and
in
particular
as
to
the
need
for
precautions
against
taking
cold
in
the
bereaved
gum
she
was
a
brave
and
determined
woman
from
start
to
finish
she
behaved
as
though
nothing
whatever
in
the
household
except
her
pastry
and
povey
had
deviated
that
day
from
the
normal
she
kissed
constance
and
sophia
with
the
most
exact
equality
and
called
them
chucks
when
they
went
up
to
bed
constance
excellent
kind
heart
tried
to
imitate
her
mother
tactics
as
the
girls
undressed
in
their
room
she
thought
she
could
not
do
better
than
ignore
sophia
deplorable
state
mother
new
dress
is
quite
finished
and
she
going
to
wear
it
on
sunday
said
she
blandly
if
you
say
another
word
i
scratch
your
eyes
out
sophia
turned
on
her
viciously
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
and
then
began
to
sob
at
intervals
she
did
not
mean
this
threat
but
its
utterance
gave
her
relief
constance
faced
with
the
fact
that
her
mother
shoes
were
too
big
for
her
decided
to
preserve
her
eyesight
long
after
the
gas
was
out
rare
sobs
from
sophia
shook
the
bed
and
they
both
lay
awake
in
silence
i
suppose
you
and
mother
have
been
talking
me
over
finely
sophia
burst
forth
to
constance
surprise
in
a
wet
voice
no
said
constance
soothingly
mother
only
told
me
told
you
what
that
you
wanted
to
be
a
teacher
and
i
will
be
too
said
sophia
bitterly
you
do
know
mother
thought
constance
but
she
made
no
audible
comment
there
was
another
detached
hard
sob
and
then
such
is
the
astonishing
talent
of
youth
they
both
fell
asleep
the
next
morning
early
sophia
stood
gazing
out
of
the
window
at
the
square
it
was
saturday
and
all
over
the
square
little
stalls
with
yellow
linen
roofs
were
being
erected
for
the
principal
market
of
the
week
in
those
barbaric
days
bursley
had
a
majestic
edifice
black
as
basalt
for
the
sale
of
dead
animals
by
the
limb
and
rib
it
was
entitled
shambles
but
vegetables
fruit
cheese
eggs
and
pikelets
were
still
sold
under
canvas
eggs
are
now
offered
at
five
farthings
apiece
in
a
palace
that
cost
thousand
pounds
yet
you
will
find
people
in
bursley
ready
to
assert
that
things
generally
are
not
what
they
were
and
that
in
particular
the
romance
of
life
has
gone
but
until
it
has
gone
it
is
never
romance
to
sophia
though
she
was
in
a
mood
which
usually
stimulates
the
sense
of
the
romantic
there
was
nothing
of
romance
in
this
picturesque
tented
field
it
was
just
the
market
holl
the
leading
grocer
was
already
open
at
the
extremity
of
the
square
and
a
boy
apprentice
was
sweeping
the
pavement
in
front
of
it
the
were
open
several
of
them
specializing
in
hot
rum
at
the
in
his
blue
coat
with
red
facings
crossed
the
square
carrying
his
big
bell
by
the
tongue
there
was
the
same
shocking
hole
in
one
of
confectioner
a
hole
which
even
her
recent
travail
could
scarcely
excuse
such
matters
it
was
that
sophia
noticed
with
dull
smarting
eyes
sophia
you
take
your
death
of
cold
standing
there
like
that
she
jumped
the
voice
was
her
mother
that
vigorous
woman
after
a
calm
night
by
the
side
of
the
paralytic
was
already
up
and
neatly
dressed
she
carried
a
bottle
and
an
and
a
small
quantity
of
jam
in
a
get
into
bed
again
do
there
a
dear
you
shivering
white
sophia
obeyed
it
was
true
she
was
shivering
constance
awoke
baines
went
to
the
and
filled
the
out
of
the
bottle
who
that
for
mother
constance
asked
sleepily
it
for
sophia
said
baines
with
good
cheer
now
sophia
and
she
advanced
with
the
in
one
hand
and
the
in
the
other
what
is
it
mother
asked
sophia
who
well
knew
what
it
was
my
dear
said
baines
winningly
the
ludicrousness
of
attempting
to
cure
obstinacy
and
yearnings
for
a
freer
life
by
means
of
is
perhaps
less
real
than
apparent
the
strange
interdependence
of
spirit
and
body
though
only
understood
intelligently
in
these
intelligent
days
was
guessed
at
by
sensible
mediaeval
mothers
and
certainly
at
the
period
when
baines
represented
modernity
was
still
the
remedy
of
remedies
it
had
supplanted
cupping
and
if
part
of
its
vogue
was
due
to
its
extreme
unpleasantness
it
had
at
least
proved
its
qualities
in
many
a
contest
with
disease
less
than
two
years
previously
old
harrop
father
of
him
who
told
baines
about
povey
being
then
aged
had
fallen
from
top
to
bottom
of
his
staircase
he
had
scrambled
up
taken
a
dose
of
at
once
and
on
the
morrow
was
as
well
as
if
he
had
never
seen
a
staircase
this
episode
was
town
property
and
had
sunk
deep
into
all
hearts
i
do
want
any
mother
said
sophia
in
dejection
i
quite
well
you
simply
ate
nothing
all
day
yesterday
said
baines
and
she
added
come
as
if
to
say
there
always
this
silly
fuss
with
do
keep
me
waiting
i
do
want
any
said
sophia
irritated
and
captious
the
two
girls
lay
side
by
side
on
their
backs
they
seemed
very
thin
and
fragile
in
comparison
with
the
solidity
of
their
mother
constance
wisely
held
her
peace
baines
put
her
lips
together
meaning
this
is
becoming
tedious
i
shall
have
to
be
angry
in
another
moment
come
said
she
again
the
girls
could
hear
her
foot
tapping
on
the
floor
i
really
do
want
it
mamma
sophia
fought
i
suppose
i
ought
to
know
whether
i
need
it
or
not
this
was
insolence
sophia
will
you
take
this
medicine
or
wo
you
in
conflicts
with
her
children
the
mother
ultimatum
always
took
the
formula
in
which
this
phrase
was
cast
the
girls
knew
when
things
had
arrived
at
the
pitch
of
wo
you
spoken
in
baines
firmest
tone
that
the
end
was
upon
them
never
had
the
ultimatum
failed
there
was
a
silence
and
i
thank
you
to
mind
your
manners
baines
added
i
wo
take
it
said
sophia
sullenly
and
flatly
and
she
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
it
was
a
historic
moment
in
the
family
life
baines
thought
the
last
day
had
come
but
still
she
held
herself
in
dignity
while
the
apocalypse
roared
in
her
ears
of
course
i
ca
force
you
to
take
it
she
said
with
superb
evenness
masking
anger
by
compassionate
grief
you
a
big
girl
and
a
naughty
girl
and
if
you
will
be
ill
you
must
upon
this
immense
admission
baines
departed
constance
trembled
nor
was
that
all
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
when
baines
was
pricing
new
potatoes
at
a
stall
at
the
top
end
of
the
square
and
constance
choosing
threepennyworth
of
flowers
at
the
same
stall
whom
should
they
both
see
walking
all
alone
across
the
empty
corner
by
the
bank
but
sophia
baines
the
square
was
busy
and
populous
and
sophia
was
only
visible
behind
a
foreground
of
restless
chattering
figures
but
she
was
unmistakably
seen
she
had
been
beyond
the
square
and
was
returning
constance
could
scarcely
believe
her
eyes
heart
jumped
for
let
it
be
said
that
the
girls
never
under
any
circumstances
went
forth
without
permission
and
scarcely
ever
alone
that
sophia
should
be
at
large
in
the
town
without
leave
without
notice
exactly
as
if
she
were
her
own
mistress
was
a
proposition
which
a
day
earlier
had
been
inconceivable
yet
there
she
was
and
moving
with
a
leisureliness
that
must
be
described
as
effrontery
red
with
apprehension
constance
wondered
what
would
happen
baines
said
nought
of
her
feelings
did
not
even
indicate
that
she
had
seen
the
scandalous
the
sight
and
they
descended
the
square
laden
with
the
lighter
portions
of
what
they
had
bought
during
an
hour
of
buying
they
went
into
the
house
by
the
king
street
door
and
the
first
thing
they
heard
was
the
sound
of
the
piano
upstairs
nothing
happened
povey
had
his
dinner
alone
then
the
table
was
laid
for
them
and
the
bell
rung
and
sophia
came
insolently
downstairs
to
join
her
mother
and
sister
and
nothing
happened
the
dinner
was
silently
eaten
and
constance
having
rendered
thanks
to
god
sophia
rose
abruptly
to
go
sophia
yes
mother
constance
stay
where
you
are
said
baines
suddenly
to
constance
who
had
meant
to
flee
constance
was
therefore
destined
to
be
present
at
the
happening
doubtless
in
order
to
emphasize
its
importance
and
seriousness
sophia
baines
resumed
to
her
younger
daughter
in
an
ominous
voice
no
please
shut
the
door
there
is
no
reason
why
everybody
in
the
house
should
hear
come
right
into
the
room
right
in
that
it
now
what
were
you
doing
out
in
the
town
this
morning
sophia
was
fidgeting
nervously
with
the
edge
of
her
little
black
apron
and
worrying
a
seam
of
the
carpet
with
her
toes
she
bent
her
head
towards
her
left
shoulder
at
first
smiling
vaguely
she
said
nothing
but
every
limb
every
glance
every
curve
was
speaking
baines
sat
firmly
in
her
own
full
of
the
sensation
that
she
had
sophia
as
it
were
writhing
on
the
end
of
a
skewer
constance
was
braced
into
a
moveless
anguish
i
will
have
an
answer
pursued
baines
what
were
you
doing
out
in
the
town
this
morning
i
just
went
out
answered
sophia
at
length
still
with
eyes
downcast
and
in
a
rather
simpering
tone
why
did
you
go
out
you
said
nothing
to
me
about
going
out
i
heard
constance
ask
you
if
you
were
coming
with
us
to
the
market
and
you
said
very
rudely
that
you
were
i
did
say
it
rudely
sophia
objected
yes
you
did
and
i
thank
you
not
to
answer
back
i
did
mean
to
say
it
rudely
did
i
constance
sophia
head
turned
sharply
to
her
sister
constance
knew
not
where
to
look
do
answer
back
baines
repeated
sternly
and
do
try
to
drag
constance
into
this
for
i
wo
have
it
oh
of
course
constance
is
always
right
observed
sophia
with
an
irony
whose
unparalleled
impudence
shook
baines
to
her
massive
foundations
do
you
want
me
to
have
to
smack
you
child
her
temper
flashed
out
and
you
could
see
ringlets
vibrating
under
the
provocation
of
sophia
sauciness
then
sophia
lower
lip
began
to
fall
and
to
bulge
outwards
and
all
the
muscles
of
her
face
seemed
to
slacken
you
are
a
very
naughty
girl
said
baines
with
restraint
got
her
said
baines
to
herself
i
may
just
as
well
keep
my
temper
and
a
sob
broke
out
of
sophia
she
was
behaving
like
a
little
child
she
bore
no
trace
of
the
young
maiden
sedately
crossing
the
square
without
leave
and
without
an
escort
i
knew
she
was
going
to
cry
said
baines
breathing
relief
i
waiting
said
baines
aloud
a
second
sob
baines
manufactured
patience
to
meet
the
demand
you
tell
me
not
to
answer
back
and
then
you
say
you
waiting
sophia
blubbered
thickly
what
that
you
say
how
can
i
tell
what
you
say
if
you
talk
like
that
but
baines
failed
to
hear
out
of
discretion
which
is
better
than
valour
it
of
no
consequence
sophia
blurted
forth
in
a
sob
she
was
weeping
now
and
tears
were
ricocheting
off
her
lovely
crimson
cheeks
on
to
the
carpet
her
whole
body
was
trembling
do
be
a
great
baby
baines
enjoined
with
a
touch
of
rough
persuasiveness
in
her
voice
it
you
who
make
me
cry
said
sophia
bitterly
you
make
me
cry
and
then
you
call
me
a
great
baby
and
sobs
ran
through
her
frame
like
waves
one
after
another
she
spoke
so
indistinctly
that
her
mother
now
really
had
some
difficulty
in
catching
her
words
sophia
said
baines
with
calm
it
is
not
i
who
make
you
cry
it
is
your
guilty
conscience
makes
you
cry
i
have
merely
asked
you
a
question
and
i
intend
to
have
an
answer
i
told
you
here
sophia
checked
the
sobs
with
an
immense
effort
what
have
you
told
me
i
just
went
out
i
will
have
no
trifling
said
baines
what
did
you
go
out
for
and
without
telling
me
if
you
had
told
me
afterwards
when
i
came
in
of
your
own
accord
it
might
have
been
different
but
no
not
a
word
it
is
i
who
have
to
ask
now
quick
i
ca
wait
any
longer
i
gave
way
over
the
my
girl
baines
said
in
her
own
breast
but
not
again
not
again
i
do
know
sophia
murmured
what
do
you
mean
you
do
know
the
sobbing
recommenced
tempestuously
i
mean
i
do
know
i
just
went
out
her
voice
rose
it
was
noisy
but
scarcely
articulate
what
if
i
did
go
out
sophia
i
am
not
going
to
be
talked
to
like
this
if
you
think
because
you
leaving
school
you
can
do
exactly
as
you
like
do
i
want
to
leave
school
yelled
sophia
stamping
in
a
moment
a
hurricane
of
emotion
overwhelmed
her
as
though
that
stamping
of
the
foot
had
released
the
demons
of
the
storm
her
face
was
transfigured
by
uncontrollable
passion
you
all
want
to
make
me
miserable
she
shrieked
with
terrible
violence
and
now
i
ca
even
go
out
you
are
a
horrid
cruel
woman
and
i
hate
you
and
you
can
do
what
you
like
put
me
in
prison
if
you
like
i
know
you
be
glad
if
i
was
dead
she
dashed
from
the
room
banging
the
door
with
a
shock
that
made
the
house
rattle
and
she
had
shouted
so
loud
that
she
might
have
been
heard
in
the
shop
and
even
in
the
kitchen
it
was
a
startling
experience
for
baines
baines
why
did
you
saddle
yourself
with
a
witness
why
did
you
so
positively
say
that
you
intended
to
have
an
answer
really
she
stammered
pulling
her
dignity
about
her
shoulders
like
a
garment
that
the
wind
has
snatched
off
i
never
dreamed
that
poor
girl
had
such
a
dreadful
temper
what
a
pity
it
is
for
her
own
sake
it
was
the
best
she
could
do
constance
who
could
not
bear
to
witness
her
mother
humiliation
vanished
very
quietly
from
the
room
she
got
halfway
upstairs
to
the
second
floor
and
then
hearing
the
loud
rapid
painful
regular
intake
of
sobbing
breaths
she
hesitated
and
crept
down
again
this
was
baines
first
costly
experience
of
the
child
thankless
for
having
been
brought
into
the
world
it
robbed
her
of
her
profound
absolute
belief
in
herself
she
had
thought
she
knew
everything
in
her
house
and
could
do
everything
there
and
lo
she
had
suddenly
stumbled
against
an
unsuspected
personality
at
large
in
her
house
a
sort
of
hard
marble
affair
that
informed
her
by
means
of
bumps
that
if
she
did
not
want
to
be
hurt
she
must
keep
out
of
the
way
v
on
the
sunday
afternoon
baines
was
trying
to
repose
a
little
in
the
where
she
had
caused
a
fire
to
be
lighted
constance
was
in
the
adjacent
bedroom
with
her
father
sophia
lay
between
blankets
in
the
room
overhead
with
a
feverish
cold
this
cold
and
her
new
dress
were
baines
sole
consolation
at
the
moment
she
had
prophesied
a
cold
for
sophia
refuser
of
and
it
had
come
sophia
had
received
for
standing
in
her
nightdress
at
a
draughty
window
of
a
may
morning
what
baines
called
slap
in
the
face
as
for
the
dress
she
had
worshipped
god
in
it
and
prayed
for
sophia
in
it
before
dinner
and
its
four
double
rows
of
gimp
on
the
skirt
had
been
accounted
a
great
success
with
her
mantle
and
her
low
stringed
bonnet
she
had
assuredly
given
a
unique
lustre
to
the
congregation
at
chapel
she
was
stout
but
the
fashions
prescribing
vague
outlines
broad
downward
slopes
and
vast
amplitudes
were
favourable
to
her
shape
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
stout
women
of
a
certain
age
never
seek
to
seduce
the
eye
and
trouble
the
meditations
of
man
by
other
than
moral
charms
baines
knew
that
she
was
comely
natty
imposing
and
elegant
and
the
knowledge
gave
her
real
pleasure
she
would
look
over
her
shoulder
in
the
glass
as
anxious
as
a
girl
make
no
mistake
she
did
not
repose
she
could
not
she
sat
thinking
in
exactly
the
same
posture
as
sophia
two
afternoons
previously
she
would
have
been
surprised
to
hear
that
her
attitude
bearing
and
expression
powerfully
recalled
those
of
her
reprehensible
daughter
but
it
was
so
a
good
angel
made
her
restless
and
she
went
idly
to
the
window
and
glanced
upon
the
empty
shuttered
square
she
too
majestic
matron
had
strange
brief
yearnings
for
an
existence
more
romantic
than
this
shootings
across
her
spirit
firmament
of
tailed
comets
soft
inexplicable
melancholies
the
good
angel
withdrawing
her
from
such
a
mood
directed
her
gaze
to
a
particular
spot
at
the
top
of
the
square
she
passed
at
once
out
of
the
room
not
precisely
in
a
hurry
yet
without
wasting
time
in
a
recess
under
the
stairs
immediately
outside
the
door
was
a
box
about
a
foot
square
and
eighteen
inches
deep
covered
with
black
american
cloth
she
bent
down
and
unlocked
this
box
which
was
padded
within
and
contained
the
baines
silver
she
drew
from
the
box
teapot
jug
and
a
flattish
dish
with
an
arching
semicircular
handle
chased
vessels
silver
without
and
within
glittering
heirlooms
that
shone
in
the
dark
corner
like
the
secret
pride
of
respectable
families
these
she
put
on
a
tray
that
always
stood
on
end
in
the
recess
then
she
looked
upwards
through
the
banisters
to
the
second
floor
maggie
she
piercingly
whispered
yes
mum
came
a
voice
are
you
dressed
yes
mum
i
just
coming
well
put
on
your
muslin
apron
baines
implied
maggie
understood
take
these
for
tea
said
baines
when
maggie
descended
better
rub
them
over
you
know
where
the
cake
is
that
new
one
the
best
cups
and
the
silver
spoons
they
both
heard
a
knock
at
the
far
off
below
there
exclaimed
baines
now
take
these
right
down
into
the
kitchen
before
you
open
yes
mum
said
maggie
departing
baines
was
wearing
a
black
alpaca
apron
she
removed
it
and
put
on
another
one
of
black
satin
embroidered
with
yellow
flowers
which
by
merely
inserting
her
arm
into
the
chamber
she
had
taken
from
off
the
chest
of
drawers
in
her
bedroom
then
she
fixed
herself
in
the
maggie
returned
rather
short
of
breath
convoying
the
visitor
ah
miss
chetwynd
said
baines
rising
to
welcome
i
sure
delighted
to
see
you
i
saw
you
coming
down
the
square
and
i
said
to
myself
i
do
hope
miss
chetwynd
is
going
to
forget
us
miss
chetwynd
simpering
momentarily
came
forward
with
that
slightly
histrionic
air
which
is
one
of
the
penalties
of
pedagogy
she
lived
under
the
eyes
of
her
pupils
her
life
was
one
ceaseless
effort
to
avoid
doing
anything
which
might
influence
her
charges
for
evil
or
shock
the
natural
sensitiveness
of
their
parents
she
had
to
wind
her
earthly
way
through
a
forest
of
the
most
delicate
susceptibilities
that
stretched
across
the
path
and
that
she
must
not
even
accidentally
disturb
with
her
skirt
as
she
passed
no
wonder
she
walked
mincingly
no
wonder
she
had
a
habit
of
keeping
her
elbows
close
to
her
sides
and
drawing
her
mantle
tight
in
the
streets
her
prospectus
talked
about
sound
and
religious
course
of
training
embracing
the
usual
branches
of
english
with
music
by
a
talented
master
drawing
dancing
and
calisthenics
also
plain
and
ornamental
also
influence
and
finally
about
terms
are
very
moderate
and
every
particular
with
references
to
parents
and
others
furnished
on
application
sometimes
too
without
application
as
an
illustration
of
the
delicacy
of
that
single
word
had
nearly
lost
her
constance
and
sophia
seven
years
before
she
was
a
pinched
virgin
aged
forty
and
not
off
in
her
family
the
gift
of
success
had
been
monopolized
by
her
elder
sister
for
these
characteristics
baines
as
a
matron
in
easy
circumstances
pitied
miss
chetwynd
on
the
other
hand
miss
chetwynd
could
choose
ground
from
which
to
look
down
upon
baines
who
after
all
was
in
trade
miss
chetwynd
had
no
trace
of
the
local
accent
she
spoke
with
a
southern
refinement
which
the
five
towns
while
making
fun
of
it
envied
all
her
o
had
a
genteel
leaning
towards
as
ritualism
leans
towards
romanism
and
she
was
the
fount
of
etiquette
a
wonder
of
correctness
in
the
eyes
of
her
pupils
parents
not
so
much
perfect
lady
as
perfect
lady
so
that
it
was
an
extremely
nice
question
whether
upon
the
whole
baines
secretly
condescended
to
miss
chetwynd
or
miss
chetwynd
to
baines
perhaps
baines
by
virtue
of
her
wifehood
carried
the
day
miss
chetwynd
carefully
and
precisely
seated
opened
the
conversation
by
explaining
that
even
if
baines
had
not
written
she
should
have
called
in
any
case
as
she
made
a
practice
of
calling
at
the
home
of
her
pupils
in
vacation
time
which
was
true
baines
it
should
be
stated
had
on
friday
afternoon
sent
to
miss
chetwynd
one
of
her
most
luxurious
notes
paper
with
scalloped
edges
the
selectest
mode
of
the
day
to
announce
in
her
italian
hand
that
constance
and
sophia
would
both
leave
school
at
the
end
of
the
next
term
and
giving
reasons
in
regard
to
sophia
before
the
visitor
had
got
very
far
maggie
came
in
with
a
lacquered
and
the
silver
teapot
and
a
silver
spoon
on
a
lacquered
tray
baines
while
continuing
to
talk
chose
a
key
from
her
bunch
unlocked
the
and
transferred
four
teaspoonfuls
of
tea
from
it
to
the
teapot
and
relocked
the
caddy
strawberry
she
mysteriously
whispered
to
maggie
and
maggie
disappeared
bearing
the
tray
and
its
contents
and
how
is
your
sister
it
is
quite
a
long
time
since
she
was
down
here
baines
went
on
to
miss
chetwynd
after
whispering
strawberry
the
remark
was
merely
in
the
way
of
for
the
hostess
felt
a
certain
unwilling
hesitation
to
approach
the
topic
of
daughters
but
it
happened
to
suit
the
social
purpose
of
miss
chetwynd
to
a
nicety
miss
chetwynd
was
a
vessel
brimming
with
great
tidings
she
is
very
well
thank
you
said
miss
chetwynd
and
her
expression
grew
exceedingly
vivacious
her
face
glowed
with
pride
as
she
added
of
course
everything
is
changed
now
indeed
murmured
baines
with
polite
curiosity
yes
said
miss
chetwynd
you
not
heard
no
said
baines
miss
chetwynd
knew
that
she
had
not
heard
about
elizabeth
engagement
to
the
reverend
archibald
jones
it
is
the
fact
that
baines
was
taken
aback
she
did
nothing
indiscreet
she
did
not
give
vent
to
her
excusable
amazement
that
the
elder
miss
chetwynd
should
be
engaged
to
any
one
at
all
as
some
women
would
have
done
in
the
stress
of
the
moment
she
kept
her
presence
of
mind
this
is
really
most
interesting
said
she
it
was
for
archibald
jones
was
one
of
the
idols
of
the
wesleyan
methodist
connexion
a
special
preacher
famous
throughout
england
at
and
sermons
archibald
jones
had
probably
no
rival
his
christian
name
helped
him
it
was
a
luscious
resounding
mouthful
for
admirers
he
was
not
an
itinerant
minister
migrating
every
three
years
his
function
was
to
direct
the
affairs
of
the
room
the
publishing
department
of
the
connexion
he
lived
in
london
and
shot
out
into
the
provinces
at
preaching
on
sundays
and
giving
a
lecture
tinctured
with
bookishness
the
chapel
on
monday
evenings
in
every
town
he
visited
there
was
competition
for
the
privilege
of
entertaining
him
he
had
zeal
indefatigable
energy
and
a
breezy
wit
he
was
a
widower
of
fifty
and
his
wife
had
been
dead
for
twenty
years
it
had
seemed
as
if
women
were
not
for
this
bright
star
and
here
elizabeth
chetwynd
who
had
left
the
five
towns
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
at
the
age
of
twenty
had
caught
him
austere
moustached
formidable
desiccated
she
must
have
done
it
with
her
powerful
intellect
it
must
be
a
union
of
intellects
he
had
been
impressed
by
hers
and
she
by
his
and
then
their
intellects
had
kissed
within
a
week
fifty
thousand
women
in
forty
counties
had
pictured
to
themselves
this
osculation
of
intellects
and
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
decided
once
more
that
men
were
incomprehensible
these
great
ones
in
london
falling
in
love
like
the
rest
but
no
love
was
a
ribald
and
voluptuous
word
to
use
in
such
a
matter
as
this
it
was
generally
felt
that
the
reverend
archibald
jones
and
miss
chetwynd
the
elder
would
lift
marriage
to
what
would
now
be
termed
an
astral
plane
after
tea
had
been
served
baines
gradually
recovered
her
position
both
in
her
own
private
esteem
and
in
the
deference
of
miss
aline
chetwynd
yes
said
she
you
can
talk
about
your
sister
and
you
can
call
him
archibald
and
you
can
mince
up
your
words
but
have
you
got
a
like
this
can
you
conceive
more
perfect
strawberry
jam
than
this
did
not
my
dress
cost
more
than
you
spend
on
your
clothes
in
a
year
has
a
man
ever
looked
at
you
after
all
is
there
not
something
about
my
situation
in
short
something
she
did
not
say
this
aloud
she
in
no
way
deviated
from
the
scrupulous
politeness
of
a
hostess
there
was
nothing
in
even
her
tone
to
indicate
that
john
baines
was
a
personage
yet
it
suddenly
occurred
to
miss
chetwynd
that
her
pride
in
being
the
prospective
of
the
rev
archibald
jones
would
be
better
for
a
while
in
her
pocket
and
she
inquired
after
baines
after
this
the
conversation
limped
somewhat
i
suppose
you
were
surprised
by
my
letter
said
baines
i
was
and
i
was
answered
miss
chetwynd
in
her
professional
manner
and
not
her
manner
of
a
prospective
of
course
i
am
naturally
sorry
to
lose
two
such
good
pupils
but
we
ca
keep
our
pupils
for
ever
she
smiled
she
was
not
without
fortitude
it
is
easier
to
lose
pupils
than
to
replace
them
still
a
pause
what
you
say
of
sophia
is
perfectly
true
perfectly
she
is
quite
as
advanced
as
constance
still
another
pause
and
a
more
rapid
enunciation
sophia
is
by
no
means
an
ordinary
girl
i
hope
she
has
been
a
very
great
trouble
to
you
oh
no
exclaimed
miss
chetwynd
sophia
and
i
have
got
on
very
well
together
i
have
always
tried
to
appeal
to
her
reason
i
have
never
forced
her
now
with
some
girls
in
some
ways
i
look
on
sophia
as
the
most
remarkable
girl
not
pupil
but
the
most
remarkable
what
shall
i
say
individuality
that
i
have
ever
met
with
and
her
demeanour
added
and
mind
you
this
is
something
from
me
indeed
said
baines
she
told
herself
i
am
not
your
common
foolish
parent
i
see
my
children
impartially
i
am
incapable
of
being
flattered
concerning
them
nevertheless
she
was
flattered
and
the
thought
shaped
itself
that
really
sophia
was
no
ordinary
girl
i
suppose
she
has
talked
to
you
about
becoming
a
teacher
asked
miss
chetwynd
taking
a
morsel
of
the
unparalleled
jam
she
held
the
spoon
with
her
thumb
and
three
fingers
her
fourth
finger
in
matters
of
honest
labour
would
never
associate
with
the
other
three
delicately
curved
it
always
drew
proudly
away
from
them
has
she
mentioned
that
to
you
baines
demanded
startled
oh
yes
said
miss
chetwynd
several
times
sophia
is
a
very
secretive
girl
very
but
i
think
i
may
say
i
have
always
had
her
confidence
there
have
been
times
when
sophia
and
i
have
been
very
near
each
other
elizabeth
was
much
struck
with
her
indeed
i
may
tell
you
that
in
one
of
her
last
letters
to
me
she
spoke
of
sophia
and
said
she
had
mentioned
her
to
jones
and
jones
remembered
her
quite
well
impossible
for
even
a
wise
uncommon
parent
not
to
be
affected
by
such
an
announcement
i
dare
say
your
sister
will
give
up
her
school
now
observed
baines
to
divert
attention
from
her
oh
no
and
this
time
baines
had
genuinely
shocked
miss
chetwynd
nothing
would
induce
elizabeth
to
give
up
the
cause
of
education
archibald
takes
the
keenest
interest
in
the
school
oh
no
not
for
worlds
then
you
think
sophia
would
make
a
good
teacher
asked
baines
with
apparent
inconsequence
and
with
a
smile
but
the
words
marked
an
epoch
in
her
mind
all
was
over
i
think
she
is
very
much
set
on
it
and
that
would
affect
her
father
or
me
said
baines
quickly
certainly
not
i
merely
say
that
she
is
very
much
set
on
it
yes
she
would
at
any
rate
make
a
teacher
far
superior
to
the
average
that
girl
has
got
the
better
of
her
mother
without
me
she
reflected
ah
here
is
dear
constance
constance
tempted
beyond
her
strength
by
the
sounds
of
the
visit
and
the
colloquy
had
slipped
into
the
room
i
left
both
doors
open
mother
she
excused
herself
for
quitting
her
father
and
kissed
miss
chetwynd
she
blushed
but
she
blushed
happily
and
really
made
a
most
creditable
debut
as
a
young
lady
her
mother
rewarded
her
by
taking
her
into
the
conversation
and
history
was
soon
made
so
sophia
was
apprenticed
to
miss
aline
chetwynd
baines
bore
herself
greatly
it
was
miss
chetwynd
who
had
urged
and
her
respect
for
miss
chetwynd
also
somehow
the
reverend
archibald
jones
came
into
the
cause
of
course
the
idea
of
sophia
ever
going
to
london
was
ridiculous
ridiculous
baines
secretly
feared
that
the
ridiculous
might
happen
but
with
the
reverend
archibald
jones
on
the
spot
the
worst
could
be
faced
sophia
must
understand
that
even
the
apprenticeship
in
bursley
was
merely
a
trial
they
would
see
how
things
went
on
she
had
to
thank
miss
chetwynd
i
made
miss
chetwynd
come
and
talk
to
mother
said
sophia
magnificently
one
night
to
simple
constance
as
if
to
imply
miss
chetwynd
is
my
washpot
to
constance
sophia
mere
enterprise
was
just
as
staggering
as
her
success
fancy
her
deliberately
going
out
that
saturday
morning
after
her
mother
definite
decision
to
enlist
miss
chetwynd
in
her
aid
there
is
no
need
to
insist
on
the
tragic
grandeur
of
renunciation
a
renunciation
which
implied
her
acceptance
of
a
change
in
the
balance
of
power
in
her
realm
part
of
its
tragedy
was
that
none
not
even
constance
could
divine
the
intensity
of
suffering
she
had
no
confidant
she
was
incapable
of
showing
a
wound
but
when
she
lay
awake
at
night
by
the
organism
which
had
once
been
her
husband
she
dwelt
long
and
deeply
on
the
martyrdom
of
her
life
what
had
she
done
to
deserve
it
always
had
she
conscientiously
endeavoured
to
be
kind
just
patient
and
she
knew
herself
to
be
sagacious
and
prudent
in
the
frightful
and
unguessed
trials
of
her
existence
as
a
wife
surely
she
might
have
been
granted
consolations
as
a
mother
yet
no
it
had
not
been
and
she
felt
all
the
bitterness
of
age
against
youth
youth
egotistic
harsh
cruel
uncompromising
youth
that
is
so
crude
so
ignorant
of
life
so
slow
to
understand
she
had
constance
yes
but
it
would
be
twenty
years
before
constance
could
appreciate
the
sacrifice
of
judgment
and
of
pride
which
her
mother
had
made
in
a
sudden
decision
during
that
rambling
starched
simpering
interview
with
miss
aline
chetwynd
probably
constance
thought
that
she
had
yielded
to
sophia
passionate
temper
impossible
to
explain
to
constance
that
she
had
yielded
to
nothing
but
a
perception
of
complete
inability
to
hear
reason
and
wisdom
ah
sometimes
as
she
lay
in
the
dark
she
would
in
fancy
snatch
her
heart
from
her
bosom
and
fling
it
down
before
sophia
bleeding
and
cry
see
what
i
carry
about
with
me
on
your
account
then
she
would
take
it
back
and
hide
it
again
and
sweeten
her
bitterness
with
wise
admonitions
to
herself
all
this
because
sophia
aware
that
if
she
stayed
in
the
house
she
would
be
compelled
to
help
in
the
shop
chose
an
honourable
activity
which
freed
her
from
the
danger
heart
how
absurd
of
you
to
bleed
chapter
iv
elephant
i
sophia
will
you
come
and
see
the
elephant
do
come
constance
entered
the
with
this
request
on
her
eager
lips
no
said
sophia
with
a
touch
of
condescension
i
far
too
busy
for
elephants
only
two
years
had
passed
but
both
girls
were
grown
up
now
long
sleeves
long
skirts
hair
that
had
settled
down
in
life
and
a
demeanour
immensely
serious
as
though
existence
were
terrific
in
its
responsibilities
yet
sometimes
childhood
surprisingly
broke
through
the
crust
of
gravity
as
now
in
constance
aroused
by
such
things
as
elephants
and
proclaimed
with
vivacious
gestures
that
it
was
not
dead
after
all
the
sisters
were
sharply
differentiated
constance
wore
the
black
alpaca
apron
and
the
scissors
at
the
end
of
a
long
black
elastic
which
indicated
her
vocation
in
the
shop
she
was
proving
a
considerable
success
in
the
millinery
department
she
had
learnt
how
to
talk
to
people
and
was
in
her
modest
way
very
she
was
getting
a
little
stouter
everybody
liked
her
sophia
had
developed
into
the
student
time
had
accentuated
her
reserve
her
sole
friend
was
miss
chetwynd
with
whom
she
was
having
regard
to
the
disparity
of
their
ages
very
intimate
at
home
she
spoke
little
she
lacked
amiability
as
her
mother
said
she
was
she
required
diplomacy
from
others
but
did
not
render
it
again
her
attitude
indeed
was
one
of
disdain
now
gentle
now
coldly
bitter
she
would
not
wear
an
apron
in
an
age
when
aprons
were
almost
essential
to
decency
no
she
would
not
wear
an
apron
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
she
was
not
so
tidy
as
constance
and
if
constance
hands
had
taken
on
the
coarse
texture
which
comes
from
commerce
with
needles
pins
artificial
flowers
and
stuffs
sophia
fine
hands
were
seldom
innocent
of
ink
but
sophia
was
splendidly
beautiful
and
even
her
mother
and
constance
had
an
instinctive
idea
that
that
face
was
at
any
rate
a
partial
excuse
for
her
asperity
well
said
constance
if
you
wo
i
do
believe
i
shall
ask
mother
if
she
will
sophia
bending
over
her
books
made
no
answer
but
the
top
of
her
head
said
this
has
no
interest
for
me
whatever
constance
left
the
room
and
in
a
moment
returned
with
her
mother
sophia
said
her
mother
with
gay
excitement
you
might
go
and
sit
with
your
father
for
a
bit
while
constance
and
i
just
run
up
to
the
playground
to
see
the
elephant
you
can
work
just
as
well
in
there
as
here
your
father
asleep
oh
very
well
sophia
agreed
haughtily
whatever
is
all
this
fuss
about
an
elephant
anyhow
it
be
quieter
in
your
room
the
noise
here
is
splitting
she
gave
a
supercilious
glance
into
the
square
as
she
languidly
rose
it
was
the
morning
of
the
third
day
of
bursley
wakes
not
the
modern
finicking
and
respectable
but
an
orgiastic
carnival
gross
in
all
its
manifestations
of
joy
the
whole
centre
of
the
town
was
given
over
to
the
furious
pleasures
of
the
people
most
of
the
square
was
occupied
by
wombwell
menagerie
in
a
vast
oblong
tent
whose
raging
beasts
roared
and
growled
day
and
night
and
spreading
away
from
this
supreme
attraction
right
up
through
the
past
the
town
hall
to
duck
bank
duck
square
and
the
waste
land
called
the
were
hundreds
of
booths
with
banners
displaying
all
the
delights
of
the
horrible
you
could
see
the
atrocities
of
the
french
revolution
and
of
the
fiji
islands
and
the
ravages
of
unspeakable
diseases
and
the
living
flesh
of
a
nearly
nude
human
female
guaranteed
to
turn
the
scale
at
stone
and
the
skeletons
of
the
mysterious
phantoscope
and
the
bloody
contests
of
champions
naked
to
the
waist
with
the
chance
of
picking
up
a
red
tooth
as
a
relic
you
could
try
your
strength
by
hitting
an
image
of
a
in
the
stomach
and
test
your
aim
by
knocking
off
the
heads
of
other
images
with
a
wooden
ball
you
could
also
shoot
with
rifles
at
various
targets
all
the
streets
were
lined
with
stalls
loaded
with
food
in
heaps
chiefly
dried
fish
the
entrails
of
animals
and
gingerbread
all
the
were
crammed
and
frenzied
jolly
drunkards
men
and
women
lunged
along
the
pavements
everywhere
their
shouts
vying
with
the
trumpets
horns
and
drums
of
the
booths
and
the
shrieking
rattling
toys
that
the
children
carried
it
was
a
glorious
spectacle
but
not
a
spectacle
for
the
leading
families
miss
chetwynd
school
was
closed
so
that
the
daughters
of
leading
families
might
remain
in
seclusion
till
the
worst
was
over
the
baineses
ignored
the
wakes
in
every
possible
way
choosing
that
week
to
have
a
show
of
mourning
goods
in
the
window
and
refusing
to
let
maggie
outside
on
any
pretext
therefore
the
dazzling
social
success
of
the
elephant
which
was
quite
easily
drawing
baines
into
the
vortex
can
not
imaginably
be
on
the
previous
night
one
of
the
three
wombwell
elephants
had
suddenly
knelt
on
a
man
in
the
tent
he
had
then
walked
out
of
the
tent
and
picked
up
another
man
at
haphazard
from
the
crowd
which
was
staring
at
the
great
pictures
in
front
and
tried
to
put
this
second
man
into
his
mouth
being
stopped
by
his
indian
attendant
with
a
pitchfork
he
placed
the
man
on
the
ground
and
stuck
his
tusk
through
an
artery
of
the
victim
arm
he
then
amid
unexampled
excitement
suffered
himself
to
be
led
away
he
was
conducted
to
the
rear
of
the
tent
just
in
front
of
baines
shuttered
windows
and
by
means
of
stakes
pulleys
and
ropes
forced
to
his
knees
his
head
was
whitewashed
and
six
men
of
the
rifle
corps
were
engaged
to
shoot
at
him
at
a
distance
of
five
yards
while
constables
kept
the
crowd
off
with
truncheons
he
died
instantly
rolling
over
with
a
soft
thud
the
crowd
cheered
and
intoxicated
by
their
importance
the
volunteers
fired
three
more
volleys
into
the
carcase
and
were
then
borne
off
as
heroes
to
different
inns
the
elephant
by
the
help
of
his
two
companions
was
got
on
to
a
railway
lorry
and
disappeared
into
the
night
such
was
the
greatest
sensation
that
has
ever
occurred
or
perhaps
will
ever
occur
in
bursley
the
excitement
about
the
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
or
about
inkerman
was
feeble
compared
to
that
excitement
critchlow
who
had
been
called
on
to
put
a
hasty
tourniquet
round
the
arm
of
the
second
victim
had
popped
in
afterwards
to
tell
john
baines
all
about
it
interest
however
had
been
slight
critchlow
succeeded
better
with
the
ladies
who
though
they
had
witnessed
the
shooting
from
the
were
thirsty
for
the
most
trifling
details
the
next
day
it
was
known
that
the
elephant
lay
near
the
playground
pending
the
decision
of
the
chief
bailiff
and
the
medical
officer
as
to
his
burial
and
everybody
had
to
visit
the
corpse
no
social
exclusiveness
could
withstand
the
seduction
of
that
dead
elephant
pilgrims
travelled
from
all
the
five
towns
to
see
him
we
going
now
said
baines
after
she
had
assumed
her
bonnet
and
shawl
all
right
said
sophia
pretending
to
be
absorbed
in
study
as
she
sat
on
the
sofa
at
the
foot
of
her
father
bed
and
constance
having
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
drew
her
mother
after
her
like
a
magnet
then
sophia
heard
a
remarkable
conversation
in
the
passage
are
you
going
up
to
see
the
elephant
mrs
baines
asked
the
voice
of
povey
yes
why
i
think
i
had
better
come
with
you
the
crowd
is
sure
to
be
very
rough
povey
tone
was
firm
he
had
a
position
but
the
shop
we
shall
not
be
long
said
povey
oh
yes
mother
constance
added
appealingly
sophia
felt
the
house
thrill
as
the
banged
she
sprang
up
and
watched
the
three
cross
king
street
diagonally
and
so
plunge
into
the
wakes
this
triple
departure
was
surely
the
crowning
tribute
to
the
dead
elephant
it
was
simply
astonishing
it
caused
sophia
to
perceive
that
she
had
miscalculated
the
importance
of
the
elephant
it
made
her
regret
her
scorn
of
the
elephant
as
an
attraction
she
was
left
behind
and
the
joy
of
life
was
calling
her
she
could
see
down
into
the
vaults
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
where
working
men
potters
and
colliers
in
their
best
clothes
some
with
high
hats
were
drinking
gesticulating
and
laughing
in
a
row
at
a
long
counter
she
noticed
while
she
was
thus
at
the
bedroom
window
a
young
man
ascending
king
street
followed
by
a
porter
trundling
a
flat
barrow
of
luggage
he
passed
slowly
under
the
very
window
she
flushed
she
had
evidently
been
startled
by
the
sight
of
this
young
man
into
no
ordinary
state
of
commotion
she
glanced
at
the
books
on
the
sofa
and
then
at
her
father
baines
thin
and
gaunt
and
acutely
pitiable
still
slept
his
brain
had
almost
ceased
to
be
active
now
he
had
to
be
fed
and
tended
like
a
bearded
baby
and
he
would
sleep
for
hours
at
a
stretch
even
in
the
daytime
sophia
left
the
room
a
moment
later
she
ran
into
the
shop
an
apparition
that
amazed
the
three
young
lady
assistants
at
the
corner
near
the
window
on
the
fancy
side
a
little
nook
had
been
formed
by
screening
off
a
portion
of
the
counter
with
large
placed
this
corner
had
come
to
be
known
as
miss
baines
corner
sophia
hastened
to
it
squeezing
past
a
young
lady
assistant
in
the
narrow
space
between
the
back
of
the
counter
and
the
wall
she
sat
down
in
constance
chair
and
pretended
to
look
for
something
she
had
examined
herself
in
the
in
the
showroom
on
her
way
from
the
when
she
heard
a
voice
near
the
door
of
the
shop
asking
first
for
povey
and
then
for
baines
she
rose
and
seizing
the
object
nearest
to
her
which
happened
to
be
a
pair
of
scissors
she
hurried
towards
the
showroom
stairs
as
though
the
scissors
had
been
a
grail
passionately
sought
and
to
be
jealously
hidden
away
she
wanted
to
stop
and
turn
round
but
something
prevented
her
she
was
at
the
end
of
the
counter
under
the
curving
stairs
when
one
of
the
assistants
said
i
suppose
you
do
know
when
povey
or
your
mother
are
likely
to
be
back
miss
sophia
here
it
was
a
divine
release
for
sophia
they
i
she
stammered
turning
round
abruptly
luckily
she
was
still
sheltered
behind
the
counter
the
young
man
whom
she
had
seen
in
the
street
came
boldly
forward
good
morning
miss
sophia
said
he
hat
in
hand
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
never
had
she
blushed
as
she
blushed
then
she
scarcely
knew
what
she
was
doing
as
she
moved
slowly
towards
her
sister
corner
again
the
young
man
following
her
on
the
customer
side
of
the
counter
ii
she
knew
that
he
was
a
traveller
for
the
most
renowned
and
gigantic
of
all
manchester
wholesale
firms
birkinshaws
but
she
did
not
know
his
name
which
was
gerald
scales
he
was
a
rather
short
but
extremely
man
of
thirty
with
fair
hair
and
a
distinguished
appearance
as
became
a
representative
of
birkinshaws
his
broad
tight
necktie
with
an
edge
of
white
collar
showing
above
it
was
particularly
elegant
he
had
been
on
the
road
for
birkinshaws
for
several
years
but
sophia
had
only
seen
him
once
before
in
her
life
when
she
was
a
little
girl
three
years
ago
the
relations
between
the
travellers
of
the
great
firms
and
their
solid
sure
clients
in
small
towns
were
in
those
days
often
cordially
intimate
the
traveller
came
with
the
lustre
of
a
historic
reputation
around
him
there
was
no
need
to
fawn
for
orders
and
the
client
immense
and
immaculate
respectability
made
him
the
equal
of
no
matter
what
ambassador
it
was
a
case
of
mutual
esteem
and
of
that
phenomenon
an
old
account
the
tone
in
which
a
commercial
traveller
of
middle
age
would
utter
the
phrase
an
old
account
revealed
in
a
flash
all
that
was
romantic
prim
and
stately
in
commerce
in
the
days
of
baines
after
one
of
the
elaborately
engraved
had
arrived
will
have
the
pleasure
of
waiting
upon
you
on
day
next
the
inst
john
might
in
certain
cases
be
expected
to
say
on
the
morning
of
day
what
have
ye
gotten
for
supper
gerald
scales
had
never
been
asked
to
supper
he
had
never
even
seen
john
baines
but
as
the
youthful
successor
of
an
aged
traveller
who
had
had
the
pleasure
of
luke
square
on
behalf
of
birkinshaws
since
before
railways
baines
had
treated
him
with
a
faint
agreeable
touch
of
maternal
familiarity
and
both
her
daughters
being
once
in
the
shop
during
his
visit
she
had
on
that
occasion
commanded
the
gawky
girls
to
shake
hands
with
him
sophia
had
never
forgotten
that
glimpse
the
young
man
without
a
name
had
lived
in
her
mind
brightly
glowing
as
the
very
symbol
and
incarnation
of
the
masculine
and
the
elegant
the
renewed
sight
of
him
seemed
to
have
wakened
her
out
of
a
sleep
assuredly
she
was
not
the
same
sophia
as
she
sat
in
her
sister
chair
in
the
corner
entrenched
behind
the
perpendicular
boxes
playing
nervously
with
the
scissors
her
beautiful
face
was
transfigured
into
the
ravishingly
angelic
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
gerald
scales
or
anybody
else
to
credit
as
he
gazed
at
those
lovely
sensitive
vivacious
responsive
features
that
sophia
was
not
a
character
of
heavenly
sweetness
and
perfection
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing
she
was
nothing
but
the
exquisite
expression
of
a
deep
instinct
to
attract
and
charm
her
soul
itself
emanated
from
her
in
an
atmosphere
of
allurement
and
acquiescence
could
those
laughing
lips
hang
in
a
heavy
pout
could
that
delicate
and
mild
voice
be
harsh
could
those
burning
eyes
be
coldly
inimical
never
the
idea
was
inconceivable
and
gerald
scales
with
his
head
over
the
top
of
the
boxes
yielded
to
the
spell
remarkable
that
gerald
scales
with
all
his
experience
should
have
had
to
come
to
bursley
to
find
the
pearl
the
paragon
the
ideal
but
so
it
was
they
met
in
an
equal
abandonment
the
only
difference
between
them
was
that
scales
by
force
of
habit
kept
his
head
i
see
it
your
wakes
here
said
he
he
was
polite
to
the
wakes
but
now
with
the
least
inflection
in
the
world
he
put
the
wakes
at
its
proper
level
in
the
scheme
of
things
as
a
local
unimportance
she
adored
him
for
this
she
was
athirst
for
sympathy
in
the
task
of
scorning
everything
local
i
expect
you
did
know
she
said
implying
that
there
was
every
reason
why
a
man
of
his
mundane
interests
should
not
know
i
should
have
remembered
if
i
had
thought
said
he
but
i
think
what
this
about
an
elephant
oh
she
exclaimed
have
you
heard
of
that
my
porter
was
full
of
it
well
she
said
of
course
it
a
very
big
thing
in
bursley
as
she
smiled
in
gentle
pity
of
poor
bursley
he
naturally
did
the
same
and
he
thought
how
much
more
advanced
and
broad
the
younger
generation
was
than
the
old
he
would
never
have
dared
to
express
his
real
feelings
about
bursley
to
baines
or
even
to
povey
who
was
however
of
no
generation
yet
here
was
a
young
woman
actually
sharing
them
she
told
him
all
the
history
of
the
elephant
must
have
been
very
exciting
he
commented
despite
himself
do
you
know
she
replied
it
was
after
all
bursley
was
climbing
in
their
opinion
and
mother
and
my
sister
and
povey
have
all
gone
to
see
it
why
they
not
here
that
the
elephant
should
have
caused
both
povey
and
baines
to
forget
that
the
representative
of
birkinshaws
was
due
to
call
was
indeed
a
final
victory
for
the
elephant
but
not
you
he
exclaimed
no
she
said
not
me
why
did
you
go
too
he
continued
his
flattering
investigations
with
a
generous
smile
i
simply
did
care
to
said
she
proudly
nonchalant
and
i
suppose
you
are
in
charge
here
no
she
answered
i
just
happened
to
have
run
down
here
for
these
scissors
that
all
i
often
see
your
sister
said
he
do
i
say
that
is
generally
when
i
come
but
never
you
i
never
in
the
shop
she
said
it
just
an
accident
oh
so
you
leave
the
shop
to
your
sister
yes
she
said
nothing
of
her
teaching
then
there
was
a
silence
sophia
was
very
thankful
to
be
hidden
from
the
curiosity
of
the
shop
the
shop
could
see
nothing
of
her
and
only
the
back
of
the
young
man
and
the
conversation
had
been
conducted
in
low
voices
she
tapped
her
foot
stared
at
the
worn
polished
surface
of
the
counter
with
the
brass
nailed
along
its
edge
and
then
she
uneasily
turned
her
gaze
to
the
left
and
seemed
to
be
examining
the
backs
of
the
black
bonnets
which
were
perched
on
high
stands
in
the
great
window
then
her
eyes
caught
his
for
an
important
moment
yes
she
breathed
somebody
had
to
say
something
if
the
shop
missed
the
murmur
of
their
voices
the
shop
would
wonder
what
had
happened
to
them
scales
looked
at
his
watch
i
dare
say
if
i
come
in
again
about
two
he
began
oh
yes
they
sure
to
be
in
then
she
burst
out
before
he
could
finish
his
sentence
he
left
abruptly
queerly
without
shaking
hands
but
then
it
would
have
been
difficult
she
argued
for
him
to
have
put
his
arm
over
the
boxes
and
without
expressing
the
hope
of
seeing
her
again
she
peeped
through
the
black
bonnets
and
saw
the
porter
put
the
leather
strap
over
his
shoulders
raise
the
rear
of
the
barrow
and
trundle
off
but
she
did
not
see
scales
she
was
drunk
thoughts
were
tumbling
about
in
her
brain
like
cargo
loose
in
a
rolling
ship
her
entire
conception
of
herself
was
being
altered
her
attitude
towards
life
was
being
altered
the
thought
which
knocked
hardest
against
its
fellows
was
only
in
these
moments
have
i
begun
to
live
and
as
she
flitted
upstairs
to
resume
watch
over
her
father
she
sought
to
devise
an
method
by
which
she
might
see
scales
when
he
next
called
and
she
speculated
as
to
what
his
name
was
iii
when
sophia
arrived
in
the
bedroom
she
was
startled
because
her
father
head
and
beard
were
not
in
their
accustomed
place
on
the
pillow
she
could
only
make
out
something
vaguely
unusual
sloping
off
the
side
of
the
bed
a
few
seconds
passed
not
to
be
measured
in
time
and
she
saw
that
the
upper
part
of
his
body
had
slipped
down
and
his
head
was
hanging
inverted
near
the
floor
between
the
bed
and
the
ottoman
his
face
neck
and
hands
were
dark
and
congested
his
mouth
was
open
and
the
tongue
protruded
between
the
black
swollen
mucous
lips
his
eyes
were
prominent
and
coldly
staring
the
fact
was
that
baines
had
wakened
up
and
being
restless
had
slid
out
partially
from
his
bed
and
died
of
asphyxia
after
having
been
unceasingly
watched
for
fourteen
years
he
had
with
an
invalid
natural
perverseness
taken
advantage
of
sophia
brief
dereliction
to
expire
say
what
you
will
amid
sophia
horror
and
her
terrible
grief
and
shame
she
had
visitings
of
the
idea
he
did
it
on
purpose
she
ran
out
of
the
room
knowing
by
intuition
that
he
was
dead
and
shrieked
out
maggie
at
the
top
of
her
voice
the
house
echoed
yes
miss
said
maggie
quite
close
coming
out
of
chamber
with
a
fetch
critchlow
at
once
be
quick
just
as
you
are
it
father
maggie
perceiving
darkly
that
disaster
was
in
the
air
and
instantly
filled
with
importance
and
a
sort
of
black
joy
dropped
her
pail
in
the
exact
middle
of
the
passage
and
almost
fell
down
the
crooked
stairs
one
of
maggie
deepest
instincts
always
held
in
check
by
the
stern
dominance
of
baines
was
to
leave
pails
prominent
on
the
main
routes
of
the
house
and
now
divining
what
was
at
hand
it
flamed
into
insurrection
no
sleepless
night
had
ever
been
so
long
to
sophia
as
the
three
minutes
which
elapsed
before
critchlow
came
as
she
stood
on
the
mat
outside
the
bedroom
door
she
tried
to
draw
her
mother
and
constance
and
povey
by
magnetic
force
out
of
the
wakes
into
the
house
and
her
muscles
were
contracted
in
this
strange
effort
she
felt
that
it
was
impossible
to
continue
living
if
the
secret
of
the
bedroom
remained
unknown
one
instant
longer
so
intense
was
her
torture
and
yet
that
the
torture
which
could
not
be
borne
must
be
borne
not
a
sound
in
the
house
not
a
sound
from
the
shop
only
the
distant
murmur
of
the
wakes
why
did
i
forget
father
she
asked
herself
with
awe
i
only
meant
to
tell
him
that
they
were
all
out
and
run
back
why
did
i
forget
father
she
would
never
be
able
to
persuade
anybody
that
she
had
literally
forgotten
her
father
existence
for
quite
ten
minutes
but
it
was
true
though
shocking
then
there
were
noises
downstairs
bless
us
bless
us
came
the
unpleasant
voice
of
critchlow
as
he
bounded
up
the
stairs
on
his
long
legs
he
strode
over
the
pail
what
amiss
he
was
wearing
his
white
apron
and
he
carried
his
spectacles
in
his
bony
hand
it
father
he
sophia
faltered
she
stood
away
so
that
he
should
enter
the
room
first
he
glanced
at
her
keenly
and
as
it
were
resentfully
and
went
in
she
followed
timidly
remaining
near
the
door
while
critchlow
inspected
her
handiwork
he
put
on
his
spectacles
with
strange
deliberation
and
then
bending
his
knees
outwards
thus
lowered
his
body
so
that
he
could
examine
john
baines
he
remained
staring
like
this
his
hands
on
his
sharp
knees
for
a
little
space
and
then
he
seized
the
inert
mass
and
restored
it
to
the
bed
and
wiped
those
clotted
lips
with
his
apron
sophia
heard
loud
breathing
behind
her
it
was
maggie
she
heard
a
huge
snorting
sob
maggie
was
showing
her
emotion
go
fetch
doctor
critchlow
rasped
and
do
stand
gaping
there
run
for
the
doctor
maggie
said
sophia
how
came
ye
to
let
him
fall
critchlow
demanded
i
was
out
of
the
room
i
just
ran
down
into
the
shop
gallivanting
with
that
young
scales
said
critchlow
with
devilish
ferocity
well
you
killed
yer
father
that
all
he
must
have
been
at
his
shop
door
and
seen
the
entry
of
the
traveller
and
it
was
precisely
characteristic
of
critchlow
to
jump
in
the
dark
at
a
horrible
conclusion
and
to
be
right
after
all
for
sophia
critchlow
had
always
been
the
personification
of
malignity
and
malevolence
and
now
these
qualities
in
him
made
him
to
her
almost
obscene
her
pride
brought
up
tremendous
reinforcements
and
she
approached
the
bed
is
he
dead
she
asked
in
a
quiet
tone
somewhere
within
a
voice
was
whispering
so
his
name
is
scales
do
i
tell
you
he
dead
pail
on
the
stairs
this
mild
exclamation
came
from
the
passage
baines
misliking
the
crowds
abroad
had
returned
alone
she
had
left
constance
in
charge
of
povey
coming
into
her
house
by
the
shop
and
showroom
she
had
first
noted
the
phenomenon
of
the
pail
proof
of
her
theory
of
maggie
incurable
untidiness
been
to
see
the
elephant
i
reckon
said
critchlow
in
fierce
sarcasm
as
he
recognized
baines
voice
sophia
leaped
towards
the
door
as
though
to
bar
her
mother
entrance
but
baines
was
already
opening
the
door
well
my
pet
she
was
beginning
cheerfully
critchlow
confronted
her
and
he
had
no
more
pity
for
the
wife
than
for
the
daughter
he
was
furiously
angry
because
his
precious
property
had
been
irretrievably
damaged
by
the
momentary
carelessness
of
a
silly
girl
yes
john
baines
was
his
property
his
dearest
toy
he
was
convinced
that
he
alone
had
kept
john
baines
alive
for
fourteen
years
that
he
alone
had
fully
understood
the
case
and
sympathized
with
the
sufferer
that
none
but
he
had
been
capable
of
displaying
ordinary
common
sense
in
the
he
had
learned
to
regard
john
baines
as
in
some
sort
his
creation
and
now
with
their
stupidity
their
neglect
their
elephants
between
them
they
had
done
for
john
baines
he
had
always
known
it
would
come
to
that
and
it
had
come
to
that
she
let
him
fall
out
o
bed
and
ye
a
widow
now
missis
he
announced
with
a
virulence
hardly
conceivable
his
angular
features
and
dark
eyes
expressed
a
murderous
hate
for
every
woman
named
baines
mother
cried
sophia
i
only
ran
down
into
the
shop
to
to
she
seized
her
mother
arm
in
frenzied
agony
my
child
said
baines
rising
miraculously
to
the
situation
with
a
calm
benevolence
of
tone
and
gesture
that
remained
for
ever
sublime
in
the
stormy
heart
of
sophia
do
not
hold
me
with
infinite
gentleness
she
loosed
herself
from
those
clasping
hands
have
you
sent
for
the
doctor
she
questioned
critchlow
the
fate
of
her
husband
presented
no
mysteries
to
baines
everybody
had
been
warned
a
thousand
times
of
the
danger
of
leaving
the
paralytic
whose
life
depended
on
his
position
and
whose
fidgetiness
was
thereby
a
constant
menace
of
death
to
him
for
five
thousand
nights
she
had
wakened
infallibly
every
time
he
stirred
and
rearranged
him
by
the
flicker
of
a
little
oil
lamp
but
sophia
unhappy
creature
had
merely
left
him
that
was
all
critchlow
and
the
widow
gazed
helplessly
waiting
at
the
pitiable
corpse
of
which
the
salient
part
was
the
white
beard
they
knew
not
that
they
were
gazing
at
a
vanished
era
john
baines
had
belonged
to
the
past
to
the
age
when
men
really
did
think
of
their
souls
when
orators
by
phrases
could
move
crowds
to
fury
or
to
pity
when
no
one
had
learnt
to
hurry
when
demos
was
only
turning
in
his
sleep
when
the
sole
beauty
of
life
resided
in
its
inflexible
and
slow
dignity
when
hell
really
had
no
bottom
and
a
bible
really
was
the
secret
of
england
greatness
england
lay
on
that
mahogany
bed
ideals
had
passed
away
with
john
baines
it
is
thus
that
ideals
die
not
in
the
conventional
pageantry
of
honoured
death
but
sorrily
ignobly
while
one
head
is
turned
and
povey
and
constance
very
went
and
saw
the
dead
elephant
and
came
back
and
at
the
corner
of
king
street
constance
exclaimed
brightly
why
who
gone
out
and
left
the
open
for
the
doctor
had
at
length
arrived
and
maggie
in
showing
him
upstairs
with
pious
haste
had
forgotten
to
shut
the
door
and
they
took
advantage
of
the
rather
guiltily
to
avoid
the
eyes
of
the
shop
they
feared
that
in
the
parlour
they
would
be
the
centre
of
a
curiosity
half
ironical
and
half
reproving
for
had
they
not
accomplished
an
escapade
so
they
walked
slowly
the
real
murderer
was
having
his
dinner
in
the
commercial
room
up
at
the
tiger
opposite
the
town
hall
iv
several
shutters
were
put
up
in
the
windows
of
the
shop
to
indicate
a
death
and
the
news
instantly
became
known
in
trading
circles
throughout
the
town
many
people
simultaneously
remarked
upon
the
coincidence
that
baines
should
have
died
while
there
was
a
show
of
mourning
goods
in
his
establishment
this
coincidence
was
regarded
as
extremely
sinister
and
it
was
apparently
felt
that
for
the
sake
of
the
mind
peace
one
ought
not
to
inquire
into
such
things
too
closely
from
the
moment
of
putting
up
the
prescribed
shutters
john
baines
and
his
funeral
began
to
acquire
importance
in
bursley
and
their
importance
grew
rapidly
almost
from
hour
to
hour
the
wakes
continued
as
usual
except
that
the
chief
constable
upon
representations
being
made
to
him
by
critchlow
and
other
citizens
descended
upon
luke
square
and
forbade
the
activities
of
wombwell
orchestra
wombwell
and
the
chief
constable
differed
as
to
the
justice
of
the
decree
but
every
person
praised
the
chief
constable
and
he
himself
considered
that
he
had
enhanced
the
town
reputation
for
a
decent
propriety
it
was
noticed
too
not
without
a
shiver
of
the
uncanny
that
that
night
the
lions
and
tigers
behaved
like
lambs
whereas
on
the
previous
night
they
had
roared
the
whole
square
out
of
its
sleep
the
chief
constable
was
not
the
only
individual
enlisted
by
critchlow
in
the
service
of
his
friend
fame
critchlow
spent
hours
in
recalling
the
principal
citizens
to
a
due
sense
of
john
baines
past
greatness
he
was
determined
that
his
treasured
toy
should
vanish
underground
with
due
pomp
and
he
left
nothing
undone
to
that
end
he
went
over
to
hanbridge
on
the
still
wonderful
and
saw
the
of
the
staffordshire
signal
then
a
weekly
with
no
thought
of
football
editions
and
on
the
very
day
of
the
funeral
the
signal
came
out
with
a
long
and
eloquent
biography
of
john
baines
this
biography
giving
details
of
his
public
life
definitely
restored
him
to
his
legitimate
position
in
the
civic
memory
as
an
bailiff
an
of
the
burial
board
and
of
the
five
towns
association
for
the
advancement
of
useful
knowledge
and
also
as
a
prime
mover
in
the
local
turnpike
act
in
the
negotiations
for
the
new
town
hall
and
in
the
corinthian
facade
of
the
wesleyan
chapel
it
narrated
the
anecdote
of
his
courageous
speech
from
the
portico
of
the
shambles
during
the
riots
of
and
it
did
not
omit
a
eulogy
of
his
steady
adherence
to
the
wise
old
english
maxims
of
commerce
and
his
avoidance
of
dangerous
modern
methods
even
in
the
sixties
the
modern
had
reared
its
shameless
head
the
panegyric
closed
with
an
appreciation
of
the
dead
man
fortitude
in
the
terrible
affliction
with
which
a
divine
providence
had
seen
fit
to
try
him
and
finally
the
signal
uttered
its
absolute
conviction
that
his
native
town
would
raise
a
cenotaph
to
his
honour
critchlow
being
unfamiliar
with
the
word
cenotaph
consulted
worcester
dictionary
and
when
he
found
that
it
meant
a
sepulchral
monument
to
one
who
is
buried
elsewhere
he
was
as
pleased
with
the
signal
language
as
with
the
idea
and
decided
that
a
cenotaph
should
come
to
pass
the
house
and
shop
were
transformed
into
a
hive
of
preparation
for
the
funeral
all
was
changed
povey
kindly
slept
for
three
nights
on
the
parlour
sofa
in
order
that
baines
might
have
his
room
the
funeral
grew
into
an
obsession
for
multitudinous
things
had
to
be
performed
and
done
sumptuously
and
in
strict
accordance
with
precedent
there
were
the
family
mourning
the
funeral
repast
the
choice
of
the
text
on
the
memorial
card
the
composition
of
the
legend
on
the
coffin
the
legal
arrangements
the
letters
to
relations
the
selection
of
guests
and
the
questions
of
hearse
plumes
number
of
horses
and
nobody
had
leisure
for
the
indulgence
of
grief
except
aunt
maria
who
after
she
had
helped
in
the
simply
sat
down
and
bemoaned
unceasingly
for
hours
her
absence
on
the
fatal
morning
if
i
had
been
so
fixed
on
polishing
my
she
weepingly
repeated
he
mit
ha
been
alive
and
well
now
not
that
aunt
maria
had
been
informed
of
the
precise
circumstances
of
the
death
she
was
not
clearly
aware
that
baines
had
died
through
a
piece
of
neglect
but
like
critchlow
she
was
convinced
that
there
had
been
only
one
person
in
the
world
truly
capable
of
nursing
baines
beyond
the
family
no
one
save
critchlow
and
harrop
knew
just
how
the
martyr
had
finished
his
career
harrop
having
been
asked
bluntly
if
an
inquest
would
be
necessary
had
reflected
a
moment
and
had
then
replied
no
and
he
added
least
said
soonest
mended
mark
me
they
had
marked
him
he
was
commonsense
in
breeches
as
for
aunt
maria
she
was
sent
about
her
snivelling
business
by
aunt
harriet
the
arrival
in
the
house
of
this
genuine
aunt
from
axe
of
this
majestic
and
enormous
widow
whom
even
the
imperial
baines
regarded
with
a
certain
awe
set
a
seal
of
ultimate
solemnity
on
the
whole
event
in
povey
bedroom
baines
fell
like
a
child
into
aunt
harriet
arms
and
sobbed
if
it
had
been
anything
else
but
that
elephant
such
was
baines
sole
weakness
from
first
to
last
aunt
harriet
was
an
exhaustless
fountain
of
authority
upon
every
detail
concerning
interments
and
to
a
series
of
questions
ending
with
the
word
sister
and
answers
ending
with
the
word
sister
the
prodigious
travail
incident
to
the
funeral
was
gradually
and
successfully
accomplished
dress
and
the
repast
exceeded
all
other
matters
in
complexity
and
difficulty
but
on
the
morning
of
the
funeral
aunt
harriet
had
the
satisfaction
of
beholding
her
younger
sister
the
centre
of
a
tremendous
cocoon
of
crape
whose
slightest
pleat
was
perfect
aunt
harriet
seemed
to
welcome
her
then
like
a
veteran
formally
into
the
august
army
of
relicts
as
they
stood
side
by
side
surveying
the
special
table
which
was
being
laid
in
the
showroom
for
the
repast
it
appeared
inconceivable
that
they
had
reposed
together
in
povey
limited
bed
they
descended
from
the
showroom
to
the
kitchen
where
the
last
delicate
dishes
were
inspected
the
shop
was
of
course
closed
for
the
day
but
povey
was
busy
there
and
in
aunt
harriet
glance
he
came
next
after
the
dishes
she
rose
from
the
kitchen
to
speak
with
him
you
got
your
boxes
of
gloves
all
ready
she
questioned
him
yes
mrs
maddack
you
not
forget
to
have
a
measure
handy
no
mrs
maddack
you
find
you
want
more
of
and
eights
than
anything
yes
i
have
allowed
for
that
if
you
place
yourself
behind
the
and
put
your
boxes
on
the
harmonium
you
be
able
to
catch
every
one
as
they
come
in
that
is
what
i
had
thought
of
mrs
maddack
she
went
upstairs
baines
had
reached
the
showroom
again
and
was
smoothing
out
creases
in
the
white
damask
cloth
and
arranging
glass
dishes
of
jam
at
equal
distances
from
each
other
come
sister
said
maddack
a
last
look
and
they
passed
into
the
mortuary
bedroom
to
gaze
at
baines
before
he
should
be
everlastingly
nailed
down
in
death
he
had
recovered
some
of
his
earlier
dignity
but
even
so
he
was
a
startling
sight
the
two
widows
bent
over
him
one
on
either
side
and
gravely
stared
at
that
twisted
worn
white
face
all
neatly
tucked
up
in
linen
i
shall
fetch
constance
and
sophia
said
maddack
with
tears
in
her
voice
do
you
go
into
the
sister
but
maddack
only
succeeded
in
fetching
constance
then
there
was
the
sound
of
wheels
in
king
street
the
long
rite
of
the
funeral
was
about
to
begin
every
guest
after
having
been
measured
and
presented
with
a
pair
of
the
finest
black
kid
gloves
by
povey
had
to
mount
the
crooked
stairs
and
gaze
upon
the
carcase
of
john
baines
going
afterwards
to
the
to
condole
briefly
with
the
widow
and
every
guest
while
conscious
of
the
enormity
of
so
thinking
thought
what
an
excellent
thing
it
was
that
john
baines
should
be
at
last
dead
and
gone
the
tramping
on
the
stairs
was
continual
and
finally
baines
himself
went
downstairs
bumping
against
corners
and
led
a
cortege
of
twenty
vehicles
the
funeral
tea
was
not
over
at
seven
five
hours
after
the
commencement
of
the
rite
it
was
a
gigantic
and
faultless
meal
worthy
of
john
baines
distant
past
only
two
persons
were
absent
from
it
john
baines
and
sophia
the
emptiness
of
sophia
chair
was
much
noticed
maddack
explained
that
sophia
was
very
and
could
not
trust
herself
great
efforts
were
put
forth
by
the
company
to
be
lugubrious
and
inconsolable
but
the
secret
relief
resulting
from
the
death
would
not
be
entirely
hidden
the
vast
pretence
of
acute
sorrow
could
not
stand
intact
against
that
secret
relief
and
the
lavish
richness
of
the
food
to
the
offending
of
sundry
important
relatives
from
a
distance
critchlow
informally
presided
over
that
assemblage
of
grave
men
in
high
stocks
and
crinolined
women
he
had
closed
his
shop
which
had
never
before
been
closed
on
a
weekday
and
he
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
this
extraordinary
closure
it
was
due
as
much
to
the
elephant
as
to
the
funeral
the
elephant
had
become
a
victim
to
the
craze
for
souvenirs
already
in
the
night
his
tusks
had
been
stolen
then
his
feet
disappeared
for
and
most
of
his
flesh
had
departed
in
little
hunks
everybody
in
bursley
had
resolved
to
participate
in
the
elephant
one
consequence
was
that
all
the
shops
in
the
town
were
assaulted
by
strings
of
boys
a
pennorth

alum
to
tak
smell
out
o
a

critchlow

ye
says

alummed

out
o
my

there

and

i
says
to
my

up
my
old
friend
john
baines
is
going
to
his
long
home
and
i
close
i
had
enough
o
alum
for
one
day
the
elephant
fed
the
conversation
until
after
the
second
relay
of
hot
muffins
when
critchlow
had
eaten
to
his
capacity
he
took
the
signal
importantly
from
his
pocket
posed
his
spectacles
and
read
the
obituary
all
through
in
slow
impressive
accents
before
he
reached
the
end
baines
began
to
perceive
that
familiarity
had
blinded
her
to
the
heroic
qualities
of
her
late
husband
the
fourteen
years
of
ceaseless
care
were
quite
genuinely
forgotten
and
she
saw
him
in
his
strength
and
in
his
glory
when
critchlow
arrived
at
the
eulogy
of
the
husband
and
father
baines
rose
and
left
the
showroom
the
guests
looked
at
each
other
in
sympathy
for
her
critchlow
shot
a
glance
at
her
over
his
spectacles
and
continued
steadily
reading
after
he
had
finished
he
approached
the
question
of
the
cenotaph
baines
driven
from
the
banquet
by
her
feelings
went
into
the
sophia
was
there
and
sophia
seeing
tears
in
her
mother
eyes
gave
a
sob
and
flung
herself
bodily
against
her
mother
clutching
her
and
hiding
her
face
in
that
broad
crape
which
abraded
her
soft
skin
mother
she
wept
passionately
i
want
to
leave
the
school
now
i
want
to
please
you
i
do
anything
in
the
world
to
please
you
go
into
the
shop
if
you
like
me
to
her
voice
lost
itself
in
tears
calm
yourself
my
pet
said
baines
tenderly
caressing
her
it
was
a
triumph
for
the
mother
in
the
very
hour
when
she
needed
a
triumph

these
singular
signs
were
being
painted
in
shiny
black
on
an
unrectangular
parallelogram
of
white
cardboard
by
constance
one
evening
in
the
parlour
she
was
seated
with
her
left
side
to
the
fire
and
to
the
fizzing
gas
at
the
which
was
covered
with
a
checked
cloth
in
red
and
white
her
dress
was
of
dark
crimson
she
wore
a
cameo
brooch
and
a
gold
chain
round
her
neck
over
her
shoulders
was
thrown
a

for
the
weather
was
extremely
cold
the
english
climate
being
much
more
serious
and
downright
at
that
day
than
it
is
now
she
bent
low
to
the
task
holding
her
head
slightly
askew
putting
the
tip
of
her
tongue
between
her
lips
and
expending
all
the
energy
of
her
soul
and

in
an
intense
effort
to
do
what
she
was
doing
as
well
as
it
could
be
done

said
povey
povey
was
fronting
her
at
the
table
he
had
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
watched
her
carefully
with
the
breathless
and
divine
anxiety
of
a
dreamer
who
is
witnessing
the
realization
of
his
dream
and
constance
without
moving
any
part
of
her
frame
except
her
head
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled
for
a
moment
and
he
could
see
her
delicious
little
nostrils
at
the
end
of
her
snub
nose
those
two
without
knowing
or
guessing
it
were
making
history
the
history
of
commerce
they
had
no
suspicion
that
they
were
the
forces
of
the
future
insidiously
at
work
to
destroy
what
the
forces
of
the
past
had
created
but
such
was
the
case
they
were
conscious
merely
of
a
desire
to
do
their
duty
in
the
shop
and
to
the
shop
probably
it
had
not
even
occurred
to
them
that
this
desire
which
each
stimulated
in
the
breast
of
the
other
had
assumed
the
dimensions
of
a
passion
it
was
ageing
povey
and
it
had
made
of
constance
a
young
lady
tremendously
industrious
and
preoccupied
povey
had
recently
been
giving
attention
to
the
question
of
tickets
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
povey
to
whom
heaven
had
granted
a
minimum
share
of
imagination
had
nevertheless
discovered
his
little
parcel
of
imagination
in
the
recesses
of
being
and
brought
it
effectively
to
bear
on
tickets
tickets
ran
in
conventional
grooves
there
were
heavy
oblong
tickets
for
flannels
shirting
and
other
stuffs
in
the
piece
there
were
smaller
and
lighter
tickets
for
intermediate
goods
and
there
were
tickets
containing
nothing
but
the
price
for
bonnets
gloves
and
flimflams
generally
the
legends
on
the
tickets
gave
no
sort
of
original
invention
the
words
as
an
adjective
and
exhausted
the
entire
vocabulary
of
tickets
now
povey
attached
importance
to
tickets
and
since
he
was
acknowledged
to
be
the
best
in
bursley
his
views
were
entitled
to
respect
he
dreamed
of
other
tickets
in
original
shapes
with
original
legends
in
brief
he
achieved
in
regard
to
tickets
the
rare
feat
of
ridding
himself
of
preconceived
notions
and
of
approaching
a
subject
with
fresh
virginal
eyes
when
he
indicated
the
nature
of
his
wishes
to
chawner
the
wholesale
stationer
who
supplied
all
the
five
towns
with
chawner
grew
uneasy
and
worried
chawner
was
indeed
shocked
for
chawner
there
had
always
been
certain
genera
of
tickets
and
he
could
not
conceive
the
existence
of
other
genera
when
povey
suggested
circular
tickets
tickets
with
a
blue
and
a
red
line
round
them
tickets
with
legends
such
as
dainty
or
note
chawner
hummed
and
hawed
and
finally
stated
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
manufacture
these
preposterous
tickets
these
tickets
which
would
outrage
the
decency
of
trade
if
povey
had
not
happened
to
be
an
exceedingly
obstinate
man
he
might
have
been
defeated
by
the
crass
toryism
of
chawner
but
povey
was
obstinate
and
he
had
resources
of
ingenuity
which
chawner
little
suspected
the
great
tramping
march
of
progress
was
not
to
be
impeded
by
chawner
povey
began
to
make
his
own
tickets
at
first
he
suffered
as
all
reformers
and
inventors
suffer
he
used
the
internal
surface
of
and
ordinary
ink
and
pens
and
the
result
was
such
as
to
give
customers
the
idea
that
baineses
were
too
poor
or
too
mean
to
buy
tickets
like
other
shops
for
bought
tickets
had
an
gloss
and
the
ink
was
black
and
glossy
and
the
edges
were
very
straight
and
did
not
show
yellow
between
two
layers
of
white
whereas
povey
tickets
were
of
a
without
gloss
the
ink
was
neither
black
nor
shiny
and
the
edges
were
amateurishly
rough
the
tickets
had
an
unmistakable
air
of
having
been
out
of
something
else
moreover
the
lettering
had
not
the
free
dashing
style
of
chawner
tickets
and
did
baines
encourage
him
in
his
enterprise
on
behalf
of
her
business
not
a
bit
baines
attitude
when
not
disdainful
was
inimical
so
curious
is
human
nature
so
blind
is
man
to
his
own
advantage
life
was
very
complex
for
povey
it
might
have
been
less
complex
had
bristol
board
and
chinese
ink
been
less
expensive
with
these
materials
he
could
have
achieved
marvels
to
silence
all
prejudice
and
stupidity
but
they
were
too
costly
still
he
persevered
and
constance
morally
supported
him
he
drew
his
inspiration
and
his
courage
from
constance
instead
of
the
internal
surface
of
he
tried
the
external
surface
which
was
at
any
rate
shiny
but
the
ink
would
not
on
it
he
made
as
many
experiments
as
edison
was
to
make
and
as
many
failures
then
constance
was
visited
by
a
notion
for
mixing
sugar
with
ink
simple
innocent
creature
why
should
providence
have
chosen
her
to
be
the
vessel
of
such
a
sublime
notion
puzzling
enigma
which
however
did
not
exercise
povey
he
found
it
quite
natural
that
she
should
save
him
save
him
she
did
sugar
and
ink
would
on
anything
and
it
shone
like
a
leather
boot
further
constance
developed
a
for
lettering
which
outdid
povey
between
them
they
manufactured
tickets
by
the
dozen
and
by
the
score
tickets
which
while
possessing
nearly
all
the
smartness
and
finish
of
chawner
tickets
were
much
superior
to
these
in
originality
and
strikingness
constance
and
povey
were
delighted
and
fascinated
by
them
as
for
baines
she
said
little
but
the
modern
spirit
was
too
elated
by
its
success
to
care
whether
she
said
little
or
much
and
every
few
days
povey
thought
of
some
new
and
wonderful
word
to
put
on
a
ticket
his
last
miracle
was
the
word
pinned
on
a
piece
of
broad
tartan
ribbon
appeared
to
constance
and
povey
as
the
finality
of
appropriateness
a
climax
worthy
to
close
the
year
povey
had
cut
the
card
and
sketched
the
word
and
figures
in
pencil
and
constance
was
doing
her
executive
portion
of
the
undertaking
they
were
very
happy
very
absorbed
in
this
strictly
business
matter
the
clock
showed
five
minutes
past
ten
stern
duty
a
pure
desire
for
the
prosperity
of
the
shop
had
kept
them
at
hard
labour
since
before
eight
that
morning
the
opened
and
baines
appeared
in
bonnet
and
furs
and
gloves
all
clad
for
going
out
she
had
abandoned
the
cocoon
of
crape
but
still
wore
weeds
she
was
stouter
than
ever
what
she
cried
not
ready
now
really
oh
mother
how
you
made
me
jump
constance
protested
what
time
is
it
it
surely
is
time
to
go
yet
look
at
the
clock
said
baines
drily
well
i
never
constance
murmured
confused
come
put
your
things
together
and
do
keep
me
waiting
said
baines
going
past
the
table
to
the
window
and
lifting
the
blind
to
peep
out
still
snowing
she
observed
oh
the
band
going
away
at
last
i
wonder
how
they
can
play
at
all
in
this
weather
by
the
way
what
was
that
tune
they
gave
us
just
now
i
could
make
out
whether
it
was
or
band
questioned
constance
the
simpleton
neither
she
nor
povey
had
heard
the
strains
of
the
bursley
town
silver
prize
band
which
had
been
enlivening
the
season
according
to
its
usual
custom
these
two
practical
duteous
commonsense
young
and
youngish
persons
had
been
so
absorbed
in
their
efforts
for
the
welfare
of
the
shop
that
they
had
positively
not
only
forgotten
the
time
but
had
also
failed
to
notice
the
band
but
if
constance
had
had
her
wits
about
her
she
would
at
least
have
pretended
that
she
had
heard
it
what
this
asked
baines
bringing
her
vast
form
to
the
table
and
picking
up
a
ticket
povey
said
nothing
constance
said
povey
thought
of
it
do
you
think
it
very
good
mother
i
afraid
i
do
baines
coldly
replied
she
had
mildly
objected
already
to
certain
words
but
seemed
to
her
silly
it
seemed
out
of
place
she
considered
that
it
would
merely
bring
ridicule
on
her
shop
written
upon
a
no
what
would
john
baines
have
thought
of
she
repeated
the
word
with
a
sarcastic
inflection
putting
the
accent
as
every
one
put
it
on
the
second
syllable
i
do
think
that
will
quite
do
but
why
not
mother
it
not
suitable
my
dear
she
dropped
the
ticket
from
her
gloved
hand
povey
had
darkly
flashed
though
he
spoke
little
he
was
as
sensitive
as
he
was
obstinate
on
this
occasion
he
said
nothing
he
expressed
his
feelings
by
seizing
the
ticket
and
throwing
it
into
the
fire
the
situation
was
extremely
delicate
priceless
employes
like
povey
can
not
be
treated
as
machines
and
baines
of
course
instantly
saw
that
tact
was
needed
go
along
to
my
bedroom
and
get
ready
my
pet
said
she
to
constance
sophia
is
there
there
a
good
fire
i
must
just
speak
to
maggie
she
tactfully
left
the
room
povey
glanced
at
the
fire
and
the
curling
red
remains
of
the
ticket
trade
was
bad
owing
to
weather
and
war
destitution
was
abroad
and
he
had
been
doing
his
utmost
for
the
welfare
of
the
shop
and
here
was
the
reward
constance
eyes
were
full
of
tears
never
mind
she
murmured
and
went
upstairs
it
was
all
over
in
a
moment
ii
in
the
wesleyan
methodist
chapel
on
duck
bank
there
was
a
full
and
influential
congregation
for
in
those
days
influential
people
were
not
merely
content
to
live
in
the
town
where
their
fathers
had
lived
without
dreaming
of
country
residences
and
smokeless
air
they
were
content
also
to
believe
what
their
fathers
had
believed
about
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
all
there
was
no
such
thing
as
the
unknowable
in
those
days
the
eternal
mysteries
were
as
simple
as
an
addition
sum
a
child
could
tell
you
with
absolute
certainty
where
you
would
be
and
what
you
would
be
doing
a
million
years
hence
and
exactly
what
god
thought
of
you
accordingly
every
one
being
of
the
same
mind
every
one
met
on
certain
occasions
in
certain
places
in
order
to
express
the
universal
mind
and
in
the
wesleyan
methodist
chapel
for
example
instead
of
a
sparse
handful
of
persons
disturbingly
conscious
of
being
in
a
minority
as
now
a
magnificent
and
proud
majority
had
collected
deeply
aware
of
its
rightness
and
its
correctness
and
the
minister
backed
by
minor
ministers
knelt
and
covered
his
face
in
the
superb
mahogany
rostrum
and
behind
him
in
what
was
then
still
called
the
though
no
musical
instruments
except
the
grand
organ
had
sounded
in
it
for
decades
the
choir
knelt
and
covered
their
faces
and
all
around
in
the
richly
painted
gallery
and
on
the
multitudinous
rows
of
people
in
easy
circumstances
of
body
and
soul
knelt
in
high
pews
and
covered
their
faces
and
there
floated
before
them
in
the
intense
and
prolonged
silence
the
clear
vision
of
jehovah
on
a
throne
a
god
of
sixty
or
so
with
a
moustache
and
a
beard
and
a
expression
which
declined
to
say
whether
or
not
he
would
require
more
bloodshed
and
this
god
destitute
of
pinions
was
surrounded
by
creatures
that
wafted
themselves
to
and
fro
while
chanting
and
afar
off
was
an
obscene
monstrosity
with
cloven
hoofs
and
a
tail
very
dangerous
and
rude
and
interfering
who
could
exist
comfortably
in
the
middle
of
a
and
who
took
a
malignant
and
exhaustless
pleasure
in
coaxing
you
by
false
pretences
into
the
same
fire
but
of
course
you
had
too
much
sense
to
swallow
his
wicked
absurdities
once
a
year
for
ten
minutes
by
the
clock
you
knelt
thus
in
mass
and
by
meditation
convinced
yourself
that
you
had
too
much
sense
to
swallow
his
wicked
absurdities
and
the
hour
was
very
solemn
the
most
solemn
of
all
the
hours
strange
that
immortal
souls
should
be
found
with
the
temerity
to
reflect
upon
mundane
affairs
in
that
hour
yet
there
were
undoubtedly
such
in
the
congregation
there
were
perhaps
many
to
whom
the
vision
if
clear
was
spasmodic
and
fleeting
and
among
them
the
inhabitants
of
the
baines
family
pew
who
would
have
supposed
that
povey
a
recent
convert
from
primitive
methodism
in
king
street
to
wesleyan
methodism
on
duck
bank
was
dwelling
upon
and
the
injustice
of
women
instead
of
upon
his
relations
with
jehovah
and
the
tailed
one
who
would
have
supposed
that
the
constance
pattern
of
daughters
was
risking
her
eternal
welfare
by
smiling
at
the
tailed
one
who
concealing
his
tail
had
assumed
the
image
of
povey
who
would
have
supposed
that
baines
instead
of
resolving
that
jehovah
and
not
the
tailed
one
should
have
ultimate
rule
over
her
was
resolving
that
she
and
not
povey
should
have
ultimate
rule
over
her
house
and
shop
it
was
a
that
belied
its
highly
satisfactory
appearance
and
possibly
there
were
other
equally
deceptive
sophia
alone
in
the
corner
next
to
the
wall
with
her
beautiful
stern
face
pressed
convulsively
against
her
hands
was
truly
busy
with
immortal
things
turbulent
heart
the
violence
of
her
spiritual
life
had
made
her
older
never
was
a
passionate
proud
girl
in
a
harder
case
than
sophia
in
the
splendour
of
her
remorse
for
a
fatal
forgetfulness
she
had
renounced
that
which
she
loved
and
thrown
herself
into
that
which
she
loathed
it
was
her
nature
so
to
do
she
had
done
it
haughtily
and
not
with
kindness
but
she
had
done
it
with
the
whole
force
of
her
will
constance
had
been
compelled
to
yield
up
to
her
the
millinery
department
for
sophia
fingers
had
a
gift
of
manipulating
ribbons
and
feathers
that
was
beyond
constance
sophia
had
accomplished
miracles
in
the
millinery
yes
and
she
would
be
utterly
polite
to
customers
but
afterwards
when
the
customers
were
gone
let
mothers
sisters
and
poveys
beware
of
her
fiery
darts
but
why
when
nearly
three
months
had
elapsed
after
her
father
death
had
she
spent
more
and
more
time
in
the
shop
secretly
aflame
with
expectancy
why
when
one
day
a
strange
traveller
entered
the
shop
and
announced
himself
the
new
representative
of
birkinshaws
why
had
her
very
soul
died
away
within
her
and
an
awful
sickness
seized
her
she
knew
then
that
she
had
been
her
own
deceiver
she
recognized
and
admitted
abasing
herself
lower
than
the
lowest
that
her
motive
in
leaving
miss
chetwynd
and
joining
the
shop
had
been
at
the
best
very
mixed
very
impure
engaged
at
miss
chetwynd
she
might
easily
have
never
set
eyes
on
gerald
scales
again
employed
in
the
shop
she
could
not
fail
to
meet
him
in
this
light
was
to
be
seen
the
true
complexion
of
the
splendour
of
her
remorse
a
terrible
thought
for
her
and
she
could
not
dismiss
it
it
contaminated
her
existence
this
thought
and
she
could
confide
in
no
one
she
was
incapable
of
showing
a
wound
quarter
had
succeeded
quarter
and
gerald
scales
was
no
more
heard
of
she
had
sacrificed
her
life
for
worse
than
nothing
she
had
made
her
own
tragedy
she
had
killed
her
father
cheated
and
shamed
herself
with
a
remorse
horribly
spurious
exchanged
content
for
misery
and
pride
for
humiliation
and
with
it
all
gerald
scales
had
vanished
she
was
ruined
she
took
to
religion
and
her
conscientious
christian
virtues
practised
with
stern
inclemency
were
the
canker
of
the
family
thus
a
year
and
a
half
had
passed
and
then
on
this
last
day
of
the
year
the
second
year
of
her
shame
and
of
her
heart
widowhood
scales
had
reappeared
she
had
gone
casually
into
the
shop
and
found
him
talking
to
her
mother
and
povey
he
had
come
back
to
the
provincial
round
and
to
her
she
shook
his
hand
and
fled
because
she
could
not
have
stayed
none
had
noticed
her
agitation
for
she
had
held
her
body
as
in
a
vice
she
knew
the
reason
neither
of
his
absence
nor
of
his
return
she
knew
nothing
and
not
a
word
had
been
said
at
meals
and
the
day
had
gone
and
the
night
come
and
now
she
was
in
chapel
with
constance
by
her
side
and
gerald
scales
in
her
soul
happy
beyond
previous
conception
of
happiness
wretched
beyond
an
unutterable
woe
and
none
knew
what
was
she
to
pray
for
to
what
purpose
and
end
ought
she
to
steel
herself
ought
she
to
hope
or
ought
she
to
despair
o
god
help
me
she
kept
whispering
to
jehovah
whenever
the
heavenly
vision
shone
through
the
wrack
of
her
meditation
o
god
help
me
she
had
a
conscience
that
when
it
was
in
the
mood
for
severity
could
be
unspeakably
cruel
to
her
and
whenever
she
looked
with
dry
hot
eyes
through
her
gloved
fingers
she
saw
in
front
of
her
on
the
wall
a
marble
tablet
inscribed
in
gilt
letters
the
cenotaph
she
knew
all
the
lines
by
heart
in
their
spacious
grandiloquence
lines
such
as
ever
ready
with
his
tongue
his
pen
and
his
purse
to
help
the
church
of
his
fathers
in
her
he
lived
and
in
her
he
died
cherishing
a
deep
and
ardent
affection
for
his
beloved
faith
and
creed
and
again
his
sympathies
extended
beyond
his
own
community
he
was
always
to
the
fore
in
good
works
and
he
served
the
circuit
the
town
and
the
district
with
great
acceptance
and
usefulness
thus
had
critchlow
vanity
been
duly
appeased
as
the
minutes
sped
in
the
breathing
silence
of
the
chapel
the
emotional
tension
grew
tighter
worshippers
sighed
heavily
or
called
upon
jehovah
for
a
sign
or
merely
coughed
an
invocation
and
then
at
last
the
clock
in
the
middle
of
the
balcony
gave
forth
the
single
stroke
to
which
it
was
limited
the
ministers
rose
and
the
congregation
after
them
and
everybody
smiled
as
though
it
was
the
millennium
and
not
simply
the
new
year
that
had
set
in
then
faintly
through
walls
and
shut
windows
came
the
sound
of
bells
and
of
steam
syrens
and
whistles
the
superintendent
minister
opened
his
and
the
hymn
was
sung
which
had
been
sung
in
wesleyan
chapels
on
new
year
morn
since
the
era
of
john
wesley
himself
the
organ
finished
with
a
clanguor
of
all
its
pipes
the
minister
had
a
few
last
words
with
jehovah
and
nothing
was
left
to
do
except
to
persevere
in
the
people
leaned
towards
each
other
across
the
high
backs
of
the
pews
a
happy
new
year
eh
thank
ye
the
same
to
you
another
watch
night
service
over
eh
yes
and
a
sigh
then
the
aisles
were
suddenly
crowded
and
there
was
a
optimistic
pushing
towards
the
door
in
the
corinthian
porch
occurred
a
great
of
cloaks
ulsters
goloshes
and
even
pattens
and
a
great
of
umbrellas
and
the
congregation
went
out
into
the
whirling
snow
dividing
into
several
black
processions
down
trafalgar
road
up
towards
the
playground
along
the
and
across
duck
square
in
the
direction
of
luke
square
povey
was
between
baines
and
constance
you
must
take
my
arm
my
pet
said
baines
to
sophia
then
povey
and
constance
waded
on
in
front
through
the
drifts
sophia
balanced
that
enormous
swaying
mass
her
mother
owing
to
their
hoops
she
had
much
difficulty
in
keeping
close
to
her
baines
laughed
with
the
complacent
ease
of
obesity
yet
a
fall
would
have
been
almost
irremediable
for
her
and
so
sophia
had
to
laugh
too
but
though
she
laughed
god
had
not
helped
her
she
did
not
know
where
she
was
going
nor
what
might
happen
to
her
next
why
bless
us
exclaimed
baines
as
they
turned
the
corner
into
king
street
there
some
one
sitting
on
our
there
was
a
figure
swathed
in
an
ulster
a
maud
over
the
ulster
and
a
high
hat
on
the
top
of
all
it
could
not
have
been
there
very
long
because
it
was
only
speckled
with
snow
povey
plunged
forward
it
scales
of
all
people
said
povey
mr
scales
cried
baines
and
mr
scales
murmured
sophia
terribly
afraid
perhaps
she
was
afraid
of
miracles
scales
sitting
on
her
doorstep
in
the
middle
of
the
snowy
night
had
assuredly
the
air
of
a
miracle
of
something
dreamed
in
a
dream
of
something
pathetically
and
impossibly
appropriate
as
they
say
in
the
five
towns
but
he
was
a
tangible
fact
there
and
years
afterwards
in
the
light
of
further
knowledge
of
scales
sophia
came
to
regard
his
being
on
the
doorstep
as
the
most
natural
and
characteristic
thing
in
the
world
real
miracles
never
seem
to
be
miracles
and
that
which
at
the
first
blush
resembles
one
usually
proves
to
be
an
instance
of
the
extremely
prosaic
iii
is
that
you
mrs
baines
asked
gerald
scales
in
a
voice
looking
up
and
then
getting
to
his
feet
is
this
your
house
so
it
is
well
i
no
idea
i
was
sitting
on
your
doorstep
he
smiled
timidly
nay
sheepishly
while
the
women
and
povey
surrounded
him
with
their
astonished
faces
under
the
light
of
the
certainly
he
was
very
pale
but
whatever
is
the
matter
mr
scales
baines
demanded
in
an
anxious
tone
are
you
ill
have
you
been
suddenly
oh
no
said
the
young
man
lightly
it
nothing
only
i
was
set
on
just
now
down
there
he
pointed
to
the
depths
of
king
street
set
on
baines
repeated
alarmed
that
makes
the
fourth
case
in
a
week
that
we
know
of
said
povey
it
really
is
becoming
a
scandal
the
fact
was
that
owing
to
depression
of
trade
lack
of
employment
and
rigorous
weather
public
security
in
the
five
towns
was
at
that
period
not
as
perfect
as
it
ought
to
have
been
in
the
stress
of
hunger
the
lower
classes
were
forgetting
their
manners
and
this
in
spite
of
the
altruistic
and
noble
efforts
of
their
social
superiors
to
relieve
the
destitution
due
of
course
to
improvidence
when
the
social
superiors
were
asking
in
despair
will
the
lower
classes
learn
to
put
by
for
a
rainy
day
they
might
have
said
a
snowy
and
a
frosty
day
it
was
too
bad
of
the
lower
classes
when
everything
that
could
be
done
was
being
done
for
them
to
kill
or
even
attempt
to
kill
the
goose
that
lays
the
golden
eggs
and
especially
in
a
respectable
town
what
indeed
were
things
coming
to
well
here
was
gerald
scales
gentleman
from
manchester
a
witness
and
victim
to
the
deplorable
moral
condition
of
the
five
towns
what
would
he
think
of
the
five
towns
the
evil
and
the
danger
had
been
a
topic
of
discussion
in
the
shop
for
a
week
past
and
now
it
was
brought
home
to
them
i
hope
you
were
said
baines
apologetically
and
sympathetically
oh
no
scales
interrupted
her
quite
gaily
i
managed
to
beat
them
off
only
my
elbow
meanwhile
it
was
continuing
to
snow
do
come
in
said
baines
i
could
think
of
troubling
you
said
scales
i
all
right
now
and
i
can
find
my
way
to
the
tiger
you
must
come
in
if
it
only
for
a
minute
said
baines
with
decision
she
had
to
think
of
the
honour
of
the
town
you
very
kind
said
scales
the
door
was
suddenly
opened
from
within
and
maggie
surveyed
them
from
the
height
of
the
two
steps
a
happy
new
year
mum
to
all
of
you
thank
you
maggie
said
baines
and
primly
added
the
same
to
you
and
in
her
own
mind
she
said
that
maggie
could
best
prove
her
desire
for
a
happy
new
year
by
contriving
in
future
not
to
her
corners
and
not
to
break
so
much
crockery
sophia
scarce
knowing
what
she
did
mounted
the
steps
scales
ought
to
let
our
new
year
in
my
pet
baines
stopped
her
oh
of
course
mother
sophia
concurred
with
a
gasp
springing
back
nervously
scales
raised
his
hat
and
duly
let
the
new
year
and
much
snow
into
the
baines
parlour
and
there
was
a
vast
deal
of
stamping
of
feet
agitating
of
umbrellas
and
shaking
of
cloaks
and
ulsters
on
the
doormat
in
the
corner
by
the
harmonium
and
maggie
took
away
an
armful
of
everything
snowy
including
goloshes
and
received
instructions
to
boil
milk
and
to
bring
povey
said
and
shut
the
door
which
was
bordered
with
felt
to
stop
ventilation
baines
turned
up
the
gas
till
it
sang
and
told
sophia
to
poke
the
fire
and
actually
told
constance
to
light
the
second
gas
excitement
prevailed
the
placidity
of
existence
had
been
agreeably
disturbed
yes
agreeably
in
spite
of
horror
at
the
attack
on
scales
elbow
by
an
adventure
moreover
scales
proved
to
be
in
and
nobody
had
ever
worn
in
that
house
before
sophia
blood
was
in
her
face
and
it
remained
there
enhancing
the
vivid
richness
of
her
beauty
she
was
dizzy
with
a
strange
and
disconcerting
intoxication
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
world
of
unrealities
and
incredibilities
her
ears
heard
with
indistinctness
and
the
edges
of
things
and
people
had
a
prismatic
colouring
she
was
in
a
state
of
ecstatic
unreasonable
inexplicable
happiness
all
her
misery
doubts
despair
rancour
churlishness
had
disappeared
she
was
as
softly
gentle
as
constance
her
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
a
fawn
and
her
gestures
delicious
in
their
modest
and
sensitive
grace
constance
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
and
after
glancing
about
as
if
for
shelter
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
by
constance
side
she
tried
not
to
stare
at
scales
but
her
gaze
would
not
leave
him
she
was
sure
that
he
was
the
most
perfect
man
in
the
world
a
shortish
man
perhaps
but
a
perfect
that
such
perfection
could
be
was
almost
past
her
belief
he
excelled
all
her
dreams
of
the
ideal
man
his
smile
his
voice
his
hand
his
hair
never
were
such
why
when
he
spoke
it
was
positively
music
when
he
smiled
it
was
heaven
his
smile
to
sophia
was
one
of
those
natural
phenomena
which
are
so
lovely
that
they
make
you
want
to
shed
tears
there
is
no
hyperbole
in
this
description
of
sensations
but
rather
an
of
them
she
was
utterly
obsessed
by
the
unique
qualities
of
scales
nothing
would
have
persuaded
her
that
the
peer
of
scales
existed
among
men
or
could
possibly
exist
and
it
was
her
intense
and
profound
conviction
of
his
complete
that
gave
him
as
he
sat
there
in
the
in
her
mother
parlour
that
air
of
the
unreal
and
the
incredible
i
stayed
in
the
town
on
purpose
to
go
to
a
new
year
party
at
lawton
scales
was
saying
ah
so
you
know
lawyer
lawton
observed
baines
impressed
for
lawyer
lawton
did
not
consort
with
tradespeople
he
was
jolly
with
them
and
he
did
their
legal
business
for
them
but
he
was
not
of
them
his
friends
came
from
afar
my
people
are
old
acquaintances
of
his
said
scales
sipping
the
milk
which
maggie
had
brought
now
scales
you
must
taste
my
mince
a
happy
month
for
every
tart
you
eat
you
know
baines
reminded
him
he
bowed
and
it
was
as
i
was
coming
away
from
there
that
i
got
into
difficulties
he
laughed
then
he
recounted
the
struggle
which
had
however
been
brief
as
the
assailants
lacked
pluck
he
had
slipped
and
fallen
on
his
elbow
on
the
kerb
and
his
elbow
might
have
been
broken
had
not
the
snow
been
so
thick
no
it
did
not
hurt
him
now
doubtless
a
mere
bruise
it
was
fortunate
that
the
miscreants
had
not
got
the
better
of
him
for
he
had
in
his
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
notes
accounts
paid
he
had
often
thought
what
an
excellent
thing
it
would
be
if
commercials
could
travel
with
dogs
particularly
in
winter
there
was
nothing
like
a
dog
you
are
fond
of
dogs
asked
povey
who
had
always
had
a
secret
but
impracticable
ambition
to
keep
a
dog
yes
said
scales
turning
now
to
povey
keep
one
asked
povey
in
a
sporting
tone
i
have
a
bitch
said
scales
that
took
a
first
at
knutsford
but
she
getting
old
now
the
sexual
epithet
fell
queerly
on
the
room
povey
being
a
man
of
the
world
behaved
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
baines
curls
protested
against
this
unnecessary
coarseness
constance
pretended
not
to
hear
sophia
did
not
understandingly
hear
scales
had
no
suspicion
that
he
was
transgressing
a
convention
by
virtue
of
which
dogs
have
no
sex
further
he
had
no
suspicion
of
the
local
fame
of
baines
he
had
already
eaten
more
than
he
could
enjoy
before
beginning
upon
hers
and
baines
missed
the
enthusiasm
to
which
she
was
habituated
from
consumers
of
her
pastry
povey
fascinated
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
dogs
and
it
grew
more
and
more
evident
that
scales
who
went
out
to
parties
in
evening
dress
instead
of
going
in
respectable
to
watch
who
knew
the
great
ones
of
the
land
and
who
kept
dogs
of
an
inconvenient
sex
was
neither
an
ordinary
commercial
traveller
nor
the
kind
of
man
to
which
the
square
was
accustomed
he
came
from
a
different
world
lawyer
lawton
party
broke
up
early
at
least
i
mean
considering
baines
hesitated
after
a
pause
scales
replied
yes
i
left
immediately
the
clock
struck
twelve
i
a
heavy
day
i
mean
it
was
not
an
hour
for
a
prolonged
visit
and
in
a
few
minutes
scales
was
ready
again
to
depart
he
admitted
a
certain
feebleness
he
playfully
called
it
being
proud
of
his
skill
in
the
dialect
and
a
burning
in
his
elbow
but
otherwise
he
was
quite
well
thanks
to
baines
most
kind
hospitality
he
really
did
know
how
he
came
to
be
sitting
on
her
doorstep
baines
urged
him
if
he
met
a
policeman
on
his
road
to
the
tiger
to
furnish
all
particulars
about
the
attempted
highway
robbery
and
he
said
he
decidedly
would
he
took
his
leave
with
distinguished
courtliness
if
i
have
a
moment
i
shall
run
in
morning
just
to
let
you
know
i
all
right
said
he
in
the
white
street
oh
do
said
constance
constance
perfect
innocence
made
her
strangely
forward
at
times
a
happy
new
year
and
many
of
them
thanks
same
to
you
do
get
lost
straight
up
the
square
and
first
on
the
right
called
the
commonsense
of
povey
nothing
else
remained
to
say
and
the
visitor
disappeared
silently
in
the
whirling
snow
brrr
murmured
povey
shutting
the
door
everybody
felt
what
a
funny
ending
of
the
old
year
sophia
my
pet
baines
began
but
sophia
had
vanished
to
bed
tell
her
about
her
new
said
baines
to
constance
yes
mother
i
do
know
that
i
so
set
up
with
that
young
man
after
all
baines
reflected
aloud
oh
mother
constance
protested
i
think
he
just
lovely
he
never
looks
you
straight
in
the
face
said
baines
do
tell
me
laughed
constance
kissing
her
mother
good
night
you
only
on
your
high
horse
because
he
did
praise
your
mince
noticed
it
iv
if
anybody
thinks
i
going
to
stand
the
cold
in
this
showroom
any
longer
they
mistaken
said
sophia
the
next
morning
loudly
and
in
her
mother
hearing
and
she
went
down
into
the
shop
carrying
bonnets
she
pretended
to
be
angry
but
she
was
not
she
felt
on
the
contrary
extremely
joyous
and
charitable
to
all
the
world
usually
she
would
take
pains
to
keep
out
of
the
shop
usually
she
was
preoccupied
and
stern
hence
her
presence
on
the
and
her
demeanour
excited
interest
among
the
three
young
lady
assistants
who
sat
sewing
round
the
stove
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
sheltered
by
the
great
pile
of
shirtings
and
linseys
that
fronted
the
entrance
sophia
shared
constance
corner
they
had
hot
bricks
under
their
feet
and
wraps
on
their
shoulders
they
would
have
been
more
comfortable
near
the
stove
but
greatness
has
its
penalties
the
weather
was
exceptionally
severe
the
windows
were
thickly
frosted
over
so
that
povey
art
in
dressing
them
was
quite
wasted
and
rare
phenomenon
the
doors
of
the
shop
were
shut
in
the
ordinary
way
they
were
not
merely
open
but
hidden
by
a
display
of
lines
povey
after
consulting
baines
had
decided
to
close
them
foregoing
the
customary
display
povey
had
also
in
order
to
get
a
little
warmth
into
his
limbs
personally
assisted
two
casual
labourers
to
scrape
the
thick
frozen
snow
off
the
pavement
and
he
wore
his
kid
mittens
all
these
things
together
proved
better
than
the
evidence
of
barometers
how
the
weather
nipped
scales
came
about
ten
instead
of
going
to
counter
he
walked
boldly
to
constance
corner
and
looked
over
the
boxes
smiling
and
saluting
both
the
girls
candidly
delighted
in
his
visit
both
blushed
both
laughed
without
knowing
why
they
laughed
scales
said
he
was
just
departing
and
had
slipped
in
for
a
moment
to
thank
all
of
them
for
their
kindness
of
last
night
rather
this
morning
the
girls
laughed
again
at
this
witticism
nothing
could
have
been
more
simple
than
his
speech
yet
it
appeared
to
them
magically
attractive
a
customer
entered
a
lady
one
of
the
assistants
rose
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
stove
but
the
daughters
of
the
house
ignored
the
customer
it
was
part
of
the
etiquette
of
the
shop
that
customers
at
any
rate
chance
customers
should
not
exist
for
the
daughters
of
the
house
until
an
assistant
had
formally
drawn
attention
to
them
otherwise
every
one
who
wanted
a
pennyworth
of
tape
would
be
expecting
to
be
served
by
miss
baines
or
miss
sophia
if
miss
sophia
were
there
which
would
have
been
ridiculous
sophia
glancing
sidelong
saw
the
assistant
parleying
with
the
customer
and
then
the
assistant
came
softly
behind
the
counter
and
approached
the
corner
miss
constance
can
you
spare
a
minute
the
assistant
whispered
discreetly
constance
extinguished
her
smile
for
scales
and
turning
away
lighted
an
entirely
different
and
inferior
smile
for
the
customer
good
morning
miss
baines
very
cold
is
it
good
morning
chatterley
yes
it
is
i
suppose
you
getting
anxious
about
those
constance
stopped
sophia
was
now
alone
with
scales
for
in
order
to
discuss
the
unnameable
freely
with
chatterley
her
sister
was
edging
up
the
counter
sophia
had
dreamed
of
a
private
conversation
as
something
delicious
and
impossible
but
chance
had
favoured
her
she
was
alone
with
him
and
his
neat
fair
hair
and
his
blue
eyes
and
his
delicate
mouth
were
as
wonderful
to
her
as
ever
he
was
gentlemanly
to
a
degree
that
impressed
her
more
than
anything
had
impressed
her
in
her
life
and
all
the
proud
and
aristocratic
instinct
that
was
at
the
base
of
her
character
sprang
up
and
seized
on
his
gentlemanliness
like
a
famished
animal
seizing
on
food
the
last
time
i
saw
you
said
scales
in
a
new
tone
you
said
you
were
never
in
the
shop
what
yesterday
did
i
no
i
mean
the
last
time
i
saw
you
alone
said
he
oh
she
exclaimed
it
just
an
accident
that
exactly
what
you
said
last
time
is
it
was
it
his
manner
or
what
he
said
that
flattered
her
that
intensified
her
beautiful
vivacity
i
suppose
you
do
often
go
out
he
went
on
what
in
this
weather
any
time
i

she
and
marketing
with

was
a
little
pause
and
to
the
free
library

shook
her
head

do
think

go

too
cold
i
do
think
i
shall
venture
out
you
must
be
very
fond
of
reading
said
he
then
povey
appeared
rubbing
his
mittened
hands
and
chatterley
went
i
run
and
fetch
mother
said
constance
baines
was
very
polite
to
the
young
man
he
related
his
interview
with
the
police
whose
opinion
was
that
he
had
been
attacked
by
stray
members
of
a
gang
from
hanbridge
the
young
lady
assistants
with
ears
cocked
gathered
the
nature
of
scales
adventure
and
were
thrilled
to
the
point
of
questioning
povey
about
it
after
scales
had
gone
his
farewell
was
marked
by
much
handshaking
and
finally
povey
ran
after
him
into
the
square
to
mention
something
about
dogs
at
one
while
baines
was
dozing
after
dinner
sophia
wrapped
herself
up
and
with
a
book
under
her
arm
went
forth
into
the
world
through
the
shop
she
returned
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
but
her
mother
had
already
awakened
and
was
hovering
about
the
back
of
the
shop
mothers
have
supernatural
gifts
sophia
nonchalantly
passed
her
and
hurried
into
the
parlour
where
she
threw
down
her
muff
and
a
book
and
knelt
before
the
fire
to
warm
herself
baines
followed
her
been
to
the
library
questioned
baines
yes
mother
and
it
simply
perishing
i
wonder
at
your
going
on
a
day
like
i
thought
you
always
went
on
thursdays
so
i
do
but
i
finished
my
book
what
is
this
baines
picked
up
the
volume
which
was
covered
with
black
she
picked
it
up
with
a
hostile
air
for
her
attitude
towards
the
free
library
was
obscurely
inimical
she
never
read
anything
herself
except
the
sunday
at
home
and
constance
never
read
anything
except
the
sunday
at
home
there
were
scriptural
commentaries
dugdale
gazetteer
culpepper
herbal
and
works
by
bunyan
and
flavius
josephus
in
the
bookcase
also
uncle
tom
cabin
and
baines
in
considering
the
welfare
of
her
daughters
looked
askance
at
the
whole
remainder
of
printed
literature
if
the
free
library
had
not
formed
part
of
the
famous
wedgwood
institution
which
had
been
opened
with
immense
eclat
by
the
gladstone
if
the
first
book
had
not
been
ceremoniously
out
of
the
free
library
by
the
chief
bailiff
in
person
a
grandfather
of
stainless
renown
baines
would
probably
have
risked
her
authority
in
forbidding
the
free
library
you
need
be
afraid
said
sophia
laughing
it
miss
experience
of
life
a
novel
i
see
observed
baines
dropping
the
book
gold
and
jewels
would
probably
not
tempt
a
sophia
of
these
days
to
read
experience
of
life
but
to
sophia
baines
the
bland
story
had
the
piquancy
of
the
disapproved
the
next
day
baines
summoned
sophia
into
her
bedroom
sophia
said
she
trembling
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
not
walk
about
the
streets
with
young
men
until
you
have
my
permission
the
girl
blushed
violently
i
i
you
were
seen
in
wedgwood
street
said
baines
who
been
gossiping
critchlow
i
suppose
sophia
exclaimed
scornfully
no
one
has
been
said
baines
well
if
i
meet
some
one
by
accident
in
the
street
i
ca
help
it
can
i
sophia
voice
shook
you
know
what
i
mean
my
child
said
baines
with
careful
calm
sophia
dashed
angrily
from
the
room
i
like
the
idea
of
him
having
heavy
day
baines
reflected
ironically
recalling
a
phrase
which
had
lodged
in
her
mind
and
very
vaguely
with
an
uneasiness
scarcely
perceptible
she
remembered
that
and
no
other
had
been
in
the
shop
on
the
day
her
husband
died
chapter
vi
escapade
i
the
uneasiness
of
baines
flowed
and
ebbed
during
the
next
three
months
influenced
by
sophia
moods
there
were
days
when
sophia
was
the
old
sophia
the
forbidding
difficult
waspish
and
even
hedgehog
sophia
but
there
were
other
days
on
which
sophia
seemed
to
be
drawing
joy
and
gaiety
and
goodwill
from
some
secret
source
from
some
fount
whose
nature
and
origin
none
could
divine
it
was
on
these
days
that
the
uneasiness
of
baines
waxed
she
had
the
wildest
suspicions
she
was
almost
capable
of
accusing
sophia
of
carrying
on
a
clandestine
correspondence
she
saw
sophia
and
gerald
scales
deeply
and
wickedly
in
love
she
saw
them
with
their
arms
round
each
other
necks
and
then
she
called
herself
a
fool
to
base
such
a
structure
of
suspicion
on
a
brief
encounter
in
the
street
and
on
an
idea
a
fancy
a
curious
and
irrational
notion
sophia
had
a
certain
streak
of
pure
nobility
in
that
exceedingly
heterogeneous
thing
her
character
moreover
baines
watched
the
posts
and
she
also
watched
sophia
she
was
not
the
woman
to
trust
to
a
streak
of
pure
nobility
and
she
came
to
be
sure
that
sophia
sinfulness
if
any
was
not
such
as
could
be
weighed
in
a
balance
or
collected
together
by
stealth
and
then
suddenly
placed
before
the
girl
on
a
charger
still
she
would
have
given
much
to
see
inside
sophia
lovely
head
ah
could
she
have
done
so
what
wonders
she
would
have
witnessed
by
what
bright
lamps
burning
in
what
mysterious
grottoes
and
caverns
of
the
brain
would
her
mature
eyes
have
been
dazzled
sophia
was
living
for
months
on
the
exhaustless
ardent
vitality
absorbed
during
a
magical
two
minutes
in
wedgwood
street
she
was
living
chiefly
on
the
flaming
fire
struck
in
her
soul
by
the
shock
of
seeing
gerald
scales
in
the
porch
of
the
wedgwood
institution
as
she
came
out
of
the
free
library
with
experience
of
life
tucked
into
her
large
astrakhan
muff
he
had
stayed
to
meet
her
then
she
knew
it
after
all
her
heart
said
i
must
be
very
beautiful
for
i
have
attracted
the
pearl
of
men
and
she
remembered
her
face
in
the
glass
the
value
and
the
power
of
beauty
were
tremendously
proved
to
her
he
the
great
man
of
the
world
the
handsome
and
elegant
man
with
a
thousand
strange
friends
and
a
thousand
interests
far
remote
from
her
had
remained
in
bursley
on
the
mere
chance
of
meeting
her
she
was
proud
but
her
pride
was
drowned
in
bliss
i
was
just
looking
at
this
inscription
about
mr
gladstone
so
you
decided
to
come
out
as
usual
and
may
i
ask
what
book
you
have
chosen
these
were
the
phrases
she
heard
and
to
which
she
responded
with
similar
phrases
and
meanwhile
a
miracle
of
ecstasy
had
opened
opened
like
a
flower
she
was
walking
along
wedgwood
street
by
his
side
slowly
on
the
scraped
pavements
where
marble
bulbs
of
snow
had
defied
the
spade
and
remained
she
and
he
were
exactly
of
the
same
height
and
she
kept
looking
into
his
face
and
he
into
hers
this
was
all
the
miracle
except
that
she
was
not
walking
on
the
pavement
she
was
walking
on
the
intangible
sward
of
paradise
except
that
the
houses
had
receded
and
faded
and
the
were
subtilized
into
unnoticeable
ghosts
except
that
her
mother
and
constance
had
become
phantasmal
beings
existing
at
an
immense
distance
what
had
happened
nothing
the
most
commonplace
occurrence
the
eternal
cause
had
picked
up
a
commercial
traveller
it
might
have
been
a
clerk
or
curate
but
it
in
fact
was
a
commercial
traveller
and
endowed
him
with
all
the
glorious
unique
incredible
attributes
of
a
god
and
planted
him
down
before
sophia
in
order
to
produce
the
eternal
effect
a
miracle
performed
specially
for
sophia
benefit
no
one
else
in
wedgwood
street
saw
the
god
walking
along
by
her
side
no
one
else
saw
anything
but
a
simple
commercial
traveller
yes
the
most
commonplace
occurrence
of
course
at
the
corner
of
the
street
he
had
to
go
till
next
time
he
murmured
and
fire
came
out
of
his
eyes
and
lighted
in
lovely
head
those
lamps
which
baines
was
mercifully
spared
from
seeing
and
he
had
shaken
hands
and
raised
his
hat
imagine
a
god
raising
his
hat
and
he
went
off
on
two
legs
precisely
like
a
dashing
little
commercial
traveller
and
escorted
by
the
equivocal
angel
of
eclipses
she
had
turned
into
king
street
and
arranged
her
face
and
courageously
met
her
mother
her
mother
had
not
at
first
perceived
the
unusual
for
mothers
despite
their
reputation
to
the
contrary
really
are
the
blindest
creatures
sophia
the
naive
ninny
had
actually
supposed
that
her
walking
along
a
hundred
yards
of
pavement
with
a
god
by
her
side
was
not
going
to
excite
remark
what
a
delusion
it
is
true
certainly
that
no
one
saw
the
god
by
direct
vision
but
sophia
cheeks
sophia
eyes
the
curve
of
sophia
neck
as
her
soul
yearned
towards
the
soul
of
the
god
these
phenomena
were
immeasurably
more
notable
than
sophia
guessed
an
account
of
them
in
a
modified
form
to
respect
baines
notorious
dignity
had
healed
the
mother
of
her
blindness
and
led
to
that
characteristic
protest
from
her
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
not
walk
about
the
streets
with
young
men
etc
when
the
period
came
for
the
reappearance
of
scales
baines
outlined
a
plan
and
when
the
circular
announcing
the
exact
time
of
his
arrival
was
dropped
into
the
she
formulated
the
plan
in
detail
in
the
first
place
she
was
determined
to
be
indisposed
and
invisible
herself
so
that
scales
might
be
foiled
in
any
possible
design
to
renew
social
relations
in
the
parlour
in
the
second
place
she
flattered
constance
with
a
single
hint
oh
the
vaguest
and
briefest
and
constance
understood
that
she
was
not
to
quit
the
shop
on
the
appointed
morning
in
the
third
place
she
invented
a
way
of
explaining
to
povey
that
the
approaching
advent
of
gerald
scales
must
not
be
mentioned
and
in
the
fourth
place
she
deliberately
made
appointments
for
sophia
with
two
millinery
customers
in
the
showroom
so
that
sophia
might
be
imprisoned
in
the
showroom
having
thus
left
nothing
to
chance
she
told
herself
that
she
was
a
foolish
woman
full
of
nonsense
but
this
did
not
prevent
her
from
putting
her
lips
together
firmly
and
resolving
that
scales
should
have
no
finger
in
the
pie
of
her
family
she
had
acquired
information
concerning
scales
at
secondhand
from
lawyer
pratt
more
than
this
she
posed
the
question
in
a
broader
form
why
should
a
young
girl
be
permitted
any
interest
in
any
young
man
whatsoever
the
everlasting
purpose
had
made
use
of
baines
and
cast
her
off
and
like
most
persons
in
a
similar
situation
she
was
unconsciously
and
quite
honestly
at
odds
with
the
everlasting
purpose
ii
on
the
day
of
scales
visit
to
the
shop
to
obtain
orders
and
money
on
behalf
of
birkinshaws
a
singular
success
seemed
to
attend
the
machinations
of
baines
with
scales
punctuality
was
not
an
inveterate
habit
and
he
had
rarely
been
known
in
the
past
to
fulfil
exactly
the
prophecy
of
the
letter
of
advice
concerning
his
arrival
but
that
morning
his
promptitude
was
unexampled
he
entered
the
shop
and
by
chance
povey
was
arranging
unshrinkable
flannels
in
the
doorway
the
two
youngish
little
men
talked
amiably
about
flannels
dogs
and
which
was
just
past
and
then
povey
led
scales
to
his
desk
in
the
dark
corner
behind
the
high
pile
of
twills
and
paid
the
quarterly
bill
in
notes
and
gold
as
always
and
then
scales
offered
for
the
august
inspection
of
povey
all
that
manchester
had
recently
invented
for
the
temptation
of
drapers
and
povey
gave
him
an
order
which
if
not
reckless
was
nearer
than
during
the
process
scales
had
to
go
out
of
the
shop
twice
or
three
times
in
order
to
bring
in
from
his
barrow
at
the
certain
small
black
boxes
edged
with
brass
on
none
of
these
excursions
did
scales
glance
wantonly
about
him
in
satisfaction
of
the
lust
of
the
eye
even
if
he
had
permitted
himself
this
freedom
he
would
have
seen
nothing
more
interesting
than
three
young
lady
assistants
seated
round
the
stove
and
sewing
with
pricked
fingers
from
which
the
chilblains
were
at
last
deciding
to
depart
when
scales
had
finished
writing
down
the
details
of
the
order
with
his
stylo
and
repacked
his
boxes
he
drew
the
interview
to
a
conclusion
after
the
manner
of
a
capable
commercial
traveller
that
is
to
say
he
implanted
in
povey
his
opinion
that
povey
was
a
wise
a
shrewd
and
an
upright
man
and
that
the
world
would
be
all
the
better
for
a
few
more
like
him
he
inquired
for
baines
and
was
deeply
pained
to
hear
of
her
indisposition
while
finding
consolation
in
the
assurance
that
the
misses
baines
were
well
povey
was
on
the
point
of
accompanying
the
pattern
of
commercial
travellers
to
the
door
when
two
customers
simultaneously
came
in
ladies
one
made
straight
for
povey
whereupon
scales
parted
from
him
at
once
it
being
a
universal
maxim
in
shops
that
even
the
most
distinguished
commercial
shall
not
hinder
the
business
of
even
the
least
distinguished
customer
the
other
customer
had
the
effect
of
causing
constance
to
pop
up
from
her
cloistral
corner
constance
had
been
there
all
the
time
but
of
course
though
she
heard
the
remembered
voice
her
maidenliness
had
not
permitted
that
she
should
show
herself
to
scales
now
as
he
was
leaving
scales
saw
her
with
her
agreeable
snub
nose
and
her
kind
simple
eyes
she
was
requesting
the
second
customer
to
mount
to
the
showroom
where
was
miss
sophia
scales
hesitated
a
moment
and
in
that
moment
constance
catching
his
eye
smiled
upon
him
and
nodded
what
else
could
she
do
vaguely
aware
though
she
was
that
her
mother
was
not
up
with
scales
and
even
feared
the
possible
influence
of
the
young
man
on
sophia
she
could
not
exclude
him
from
her
general
benevolence
towards
the
universe
moreover
she
liked
him
she
liked
him
very
much
and
thought
him
a
very
fine
specimen
of
a
man
he
left
the
door
and
went
across
to
her
they
shook
hands
and
opened
a
conversation
instantly
for
constance
while
retaining
all
her
modesty
had
lost
all
her
shyness
in
the
shop
and
could
chatter
with
anybody
she
sidled
towards
her
corner
precisely
as
sophia
had
done
on
another
occasion
and
scales
put
his
chin
over
the
screening
boxes
and
eagerly
prosecuted
the
conversation
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
fact
of
the
interview
itself
to
cause
alarm
to
a
mother
nothing
to
render
futile
the
precautions
of
baines
on
behalf
of
the
flower
of
sophia
innocence
and
yet
it
held
danger
for
baines
all
unconscious
in
her
parlour
baines
could
rely
utterly
on
constance
not
to
be
led
away
by
the
dandiacal
charms
of
scales
she
knew
in
what
quarter
sat
the
wind
for
constance
in
her
plan
she
had
forgotten
nothing
except
povey
and
it
must
be
said
that
she
could
not
possibly
have
foreseen
the
effect
on
the
situation
of
povey
character
povey
attending
to
his
customer
had
noticed
the
bright
smile
of
constance
on
the
traveller
and
his
heart
did
not
like
it
and
when
he
saw
the
lively
gestures
of
a
scales
in
apparently
intimate
talk
with
a
constance
hidden
behind
boxes
his
uneasiness
grew
into
fury
he
was
a
man
capable
of
black
and
terrible
furies
outwardly
insignificant
possessing
a
mind
as
little
as
his
body
easily
abashed
he
was
none
the
less
a
very
susceptible
young
man
soon
offended
proud
vain
and
obscurely
passionate
you
might
offend
povey
without
guessing
it
and
only
discover
your
sin
when
povey
had
done
something
too
decisive
as
a
result
of
it
the
reason
of
his
fury
was
jealousy
povey
had
made
great
advances
since
the
death
of
john
baines
he
had
consolidated
his
position
and
he
was
in
every
way
a
personage
of
the
first
importance
his
misfortune
was
that
he
could
never
translate
his
importance
or
his
sense
of
his
importance
into
terms
of
outward
demeanour
most
people
had
they
been
told
that
povey
was
seriously
aspiring
to
enter
the
baines
family
would
have
laughed
but
they
would
have
been
wrong
to
laugh
at
povey
was
invariably
wrong
only
constance
knew
what
inroads
he
had
effected
upon
her
the
customer
went
but
scales
did
not
go
povey
free
to
reconnoitre
did
so
from
the
shadow
of
the
till
he
could
catch
glimpses
of
constance
blushing
vivacious
face
she
was
obviously
absorbed
in
scales
she
and
he
had
a
tremendous
air
of
intimacy
and
the
murmur
of
their
chatter
continued
their
chatter
was
nothing
and
about
nothing
but
povey
imagined
that
they
were
exchanging
eternal
vows
he
endured
scales
odious
freedom
until
it
became
insufferable
until
it
deprived
him
of
all
his
and
then
he
retired
into
his
room
he
meditated
there
in
a
condition
of
insanity
for
perhaps
a
minute
and
excogitated
a
device
dashing
back
into
the
shop
he
spoke
up
half
across
the
shop
in
a
loud
curt
tone
miss
baines
your
mother
wants
you
at
once
he
was
launched
on
the
phrase
before
he
noticed
that
during
his
absence
sophia
had
descended
from
the
showroom
and
joined
her
sister
and
scales
the
danger
and
scandal
were
now
less
he
perceived
but
he
was
glad
he
had
summoned
constance
away
and
he
was
in
a
state
to
despise
consequences
the
three
chatterers
startled
looked
at
povey
who
left
the
shop
abruptly
constance
could
do
nothing
but
obey
the
call
she
met
him
at
the
door
of
the
room
in
the
passage
leading
to
the
parlour
where
is
mother
in
the
parlour
constance
inquired
innocently
there
was
a
dark
flush
on
povey
face
if
you
wish
to
know
said
he
in
a
hard
voice
she
has
asked
for
you
and
she
does
want
you
he
turned
his
back
on
her
and
retreated
into
his
lair
then
what
she
began
puzzled
he
fronted
her
have
you
been
gabbling
long
enough
with
that
jackanapes
he
spit
at
her
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
constance
though
without
experience
in
these
matters
comprehended
she
comprehended
perfectly
and
immediately
she
ought
to
have
put
povey
into
his
place
she
ought
to
have
protested
with
firm
dignified
finality
against
such
a
ridiculous
and
monstrous
outrage
as
that
which
povey
had
committed
povey
ought
to
have
been
ruined
for
ever
in
her
esteem
and
in
her
heart
but
she
hesitated
and
only
last
sunday
afternoon
povey
blubbered
not
that
anything
overt
had
occurred
or
been
articulately
said
between
them
last
sunday
afternoon
but
they
had
been
alone
together
and
had
each
witnessed
strange
and
disturbing
matters
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
tears
now
fell
suddenly
from
constance
eyes
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
she
stammered
still
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
and
in
his
too
what
he
or
she
merely
said
therefore
was
of
secondary
importance
baines
coming
from
the
kitchen
and
hearing
constance
voice
burst
upon
the
scene
which
silenced
her
parents
are
sometimes
silenced
she
found
sophia
and
scales
in
the
shop
iii
that
afternoon
sophia
too
busy
with
her
own
affairs
to
notice
anything
abnormal
in
the
relations
between
her
mother
and
constance
and
quite
ignorant
that
there
had
been
an
unsuccessful
plot
against
her
went
forth
to
call
upon
miss
chetwynd
with
whom
she
had
remained
very
friendly
she
considered
that
she
and
miss
chetwynd
formed
an
aristocracy
of
intellect
and
the
family
indeed
tacitly
admitted
this
she
practised
no
secrecy
in
her
departure
from
the
shop
she
merely
dressed
in
her
hoop
and
went
having
been
ready
at
any
moment
to
tell
her
mother
if
her
mother
caught
her
and
inquired
that
she
was
going
to
see
miss
chetwynd
and
she
did
go
to
see
miss
chetwynd
arriving
at
the
which
lay
amid
trees
on
the
road
to
turnhill
just
beyond
the
turnpike
at
precisely
a
four
as
miss
chetwynd
pupils
left
at
four
and
as
miss
chetwynd
invariably
took
a
walk
immediately
afterwards
sophia
was
able
to
contain
her
surprise
upon
being
informed
that
miss
chetwynd
was
not
in
she
had
not
intended
that
miss
chetwynd
should
be
in
she
turned
off
to
the
right
up
the
side
road
which
starting
from
the
turnpike
led
in
the
direction
of
moorthorne
and
red
cow
two
mining
villages
her
heart
beat
with
fear
as
she
began
to
follow
that
road
for
she
was
upon
a
terrific
adventure
what
most
frightened
her
perhaps
was
her
own
astounding
audacity
she
was
alarmed
by
something
within
herself
which
seemed
to
be
no
part
of
herself
and
which
produced
in
her
curious
disconcerting
fleeting
impressions
of
unreality
in
the
morning
she
had
heard
the
voice
of
scales
from
the
showroom
that
voice
whose
even
distant
murmur
caused
creepings
of
the
skin
in
her
back
and
she
had
actually
stood
on
the
counter
in
front
of
the
window
in
order
to
see
down
perpendicularly
into
the
square
by
so
doing
she
had
had
a
glimpse
of
the
top
of
his
luggage
on
a
barrow
and
of
the
crown
of
his
hat
occasionally
when
he
went
outside
to
tempt
povey
she
might
have
gone
down
into
the
shop
there
was
no
slightest
reason
why
she
should
not
three
months
had
elapsed
since
the
name
of
scales
had
been
mentioned
and
her
mother
had
evidently
forgotten
the
trifling
incident
of
new
year
day
but
she
was
incapable
of
descending
the
stairs
she
went
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
peeped
through
the
balustrade
and
she
could
not
get
further
for
nearly
a
hundred
days
those
extraordinary
lamps
had
been
brightly
burning
in
her
head
and
now
the
had
come
again
and
her
feet
would
not
move
to
the
meeting
now
the
moment
had
arrived
for
which
alone
she
had
lived
and
she
could
not
seize
it
as
it
passed
why
do
i
go
downstairs
she
asked
herself
am
i
afraid
to
meet
him
the
customer
sent
up
by
constance
had
occupied
the
surface
of
her
life
for
ten
minutes
trying
on
hats
and
during
this
time
she
was
praying
wildly
that
scales
might
not
go
and
asserting
that
it
was
impossible
he
should
go
without
at
least
asking
for
her
had
she
not
counted
the
days
to
this
day
when
the
customer
left
sophia
followed
her
downstairs
and
saw
scales
chatting
with
constance
all
her
instantly
returned
to
her
and
she
joined
them
with
a
rather
mocking
smile
after
povey
strange
summons
had
withdrawn
constance
from
the
corner
scales
tone
had
changed
it
had
thrilled
her
you
are
you
it
had
said
there
is
you
and
there
is
the
rest
of
the
universe
then
he
had
not
forgotten
she
had
lived
in
his
heart
she
had
not
for
three
months
been
the
victim
of
her
own
fancies
she
saw
him
put
a
piece
of
folded
white
paper
on
the
top
edge
of
the
screening
box
and
flick
it
down
to
her
she
blushed
scarlet
staring
at
it
as
it
lay
on
the
counter
he
said
nothing
and
she
could
not
speak
he
had
prepared
that
paper
then
beforehand
on
the
chance
of
being
able
to
give
it
to
her
this
thought
was
exquisite
but
full
of
terror
i
must
really
go
he
had
said
lamely
with
emotion
in
his
voice
and
he
had
gone
like
that
and
she
put
the
piece
of
paper
into
the
pocket
of
her
apron
and
hastened
away
she
had
not
even
seen
as
she
turned
up
the
stairs
her
mother
standing
by
the
till
that
spot
which
was
the
of
the
whole
shop
she
ran
ran
breathless
to
the
bedroom
i
am
a
wicked
girl
she
said
quite
frankly
on
the
road
to
the
rendezvous
it
is
a
dream
that
i
am
going
to
meet
him
it
can
not
be
true
there
is
time
to
go
back
if
i
go
back
i
am
safe
i
have
simply
called
at
miss
chetwynd
and
she
was
in
and
no
one
can
say
a
word
but
if
i
go
on
if
i
seen
what
a
fool
i
am
to
go
on
and
she
went
on
impelled
by
amongst
other
things
an
immense
naive
curiosity
and
the
vanity
which
the
bare
fact
of
his
note
had
excited
the
loop
railway
was
being
constructed
at
that
period
and
hundreds
of
navvies
were
at
work
on
it
between
bursley
and
turnhill
when
she
came
to
the
new
bridge
over
the
cutting
he
was
there
as
he
had
written
that
he
would
be
they
were
very
nervous
they
greeted
each
other
stiffly
and
as
though
they
had
met
then
for
the
first
time
that
day
nothing
was
said
about
his
note
nor
about
her
response
to
it
her
presence
was
treated
by
both
of
them
as
a
basic
fact
of
the
situation
which
it
would
be
well
not
to
disturb
by
comment
sophia
could
not
hide
her
shame
but
her
shame
only
aggravated
the
stinging
charm
of
her
beauty
she
was
wearing
a
hard
amazonian
hat
with
a
lifted
veil
the
final
word
of
fashion
that
spring
in
the
five
towns
her
face
beaten
by
the
fresh
breeze
shone
rosily
her
eyes
glittered
under
the
dark
hat
and
the
violent
colours
of
her
victorian
frock
green
and
crimson
could
not
spoil
those
cheeks
if
she
looked
earthwards
frowning
she
was
the
more
adorable
so
he
had
come
down
the
clayey
incline
from
the
unfinished
red
bridge
to
welcome
her
and
when
the
salutations
were
over
they
stood
still
he
gazing
apparently
at
the
horizon
and
she
at
the
yellow
marl
round
the
edges
of
his
boots
the
encounter
was
as
far
away
from
sophia
ideal
conception
as
manchester
from
venice
so
this
is
the
new
railway
said
she
yes
said
he
this
is
your
new
railway
you
can
see
it
better
from
the
bridge
but
it
very
sludgy
up
there
she
objected
with
a
pout
further
on
it
quite
dry
he
reassured
her
from
the
bridge
they
had
a
sudden
view
of
a
raw
gash
in
the
earth
and
hundreds
of
men
were
crawling
about
in
it
busy
with
minute
operations
like
flies
in
a
great
wound
there
was
a
continuous
rattle
of
picks
resembling
a
muffled
shower
of
hail
and
in
the
distance
a
tiny
locomotive
was
leading
a
procession
of
tiny
waggons
and
those
are
the
navvies
she
murmured
the
unspeakable
doings
of
the
navvies
in
the
five
towns
had
reached
even
her
how
they
drank
and
swore
all
day
on
sundays
how
their
huts
and
houses
were
dens
of
the
most
appalling
infamy
how
they
were
the
curse
of
a
and
respectable
district
she
and
gerald
scales
glanced
down
at
these
dangerous
beasts
of
prey
in
their
yellow
corduroys
and
their
open
shirts
revealing
hairy
chests
no
doubt
they
both
thought
how
inconvenient
it
was
that
railways
could
not
be
brought
into
existence
without
the
aid
of
such
revolting
and
swinish
animals
they
glanced
down
from
the
height
of
their
nice
decorum
and
felt
the
powerful
attraction
of
similar
superior
manners
the
manners
of
the
navvies
were
such
that
sophia
could
not
even
regard
them
nor
gerald
scales
permit
her
to
regard
them
without
blushing
in
a
united
blush
they
turned
away
up
the
gradual
slope
sophia
knew
no
longer
what
she
was
doing
for
some
minutes
she
was
as
helpless
as
though
she
had
been
in
a
balloon
with
him
i
got
my
work
done
early
he
said
and
added
complacently
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
a
pretty
good
day
she
was
reassured
to
learn
that
he
was
not
neglecting
his
duties
to
be
philandering
with
a
commercial
traveller
who
has
finished
a
good
work
seemed
less
shocking
than
dalliance
with
a
neglecter
of
business
it
seemed
indeed
by
comparison
respectable
it
must
be
very
interesting
she
said
primly
what
my
trade
yes
always
seeing
new
places
and
so
on
in
a
way
it
is
he
admitted
judicially
but
i
can
tell
you
it
was
much
more
agreeable
being
in
paris
oh
have
you
been
to
paris
lived
there
for
nearly
two
years
he
said
carelessly
then
looking
at
her
did
you
notice
i
never
came
for
a
long
time
i
did
know
you
were
in
paris
she
evaded
him
i
went
to
start
a
sort
of
agency
for
birkinshaws
he
said
i
suppose
you
talk
french
like
anything
of
course
one
has
to
talk
french
said
he
i
learnt
french
when
i
was
a
child
from
a
governess
my
uncle
made
me
but
i
forgot
most
of
it
at
school
and
at
the
varsity
you
never
learn
anything
precious
little
anyhow
certainly
not
french
she
was
deeply
impressed
he
was
a
much
greater
personage
than
she
had
guessed
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
commercial
travellers
had
to
go
to
a
university
to
finish
their
complex
education
and
then
paris
paris
meant
absolutely
nothing
to
her
but
pure
impossible
unattainable
romance
and
he
had
been
there
the
clouds
of
glory
were
around
him
he
was
a
hero
dazzling
he
had
come
to
her
out
of
another
world
he
was
her
miracle
he
was
almost
too
miraculous
to
be
true
she
living
her
humdrum
life
at
the
shop
and
he
elegant
brilliant
coming
from
far
cities
they
together
side
by
side
strolling
up
the
road
towards
the
moorthorne
ridge
there
was
nothing
quite
like
this
in
the
stories
of
miss
sewell
your
uncle
she
questioned
vaguely
yes
boldero
he
a
partner
in
birkinshaws
oh
you
heard
of
him
he
a
great
wesleyan
oh
yes
she
said
when
we
had
the
wesleyan
conference
here
he
he
always
very
great
at
conferences
said
gerald
scales
i
did
know
he
had
anything
to
do
with
birkinshaws
he
is
a
working
partner
of
course
scales
explained
but
he
means
me
to
be
one
i
have
to
learn
the
business
from
the
bottom
so
now
you
understand
why
i
a
traveller
i
see
she
said
still
more
deeply
impressed
i
an
orphan
said
gerald
and
uncle
boldero
took
me
in
hand
when
i
was
three
i
see
she
repeated
it
seemed
strange
to
her
that
scales
should
be
a
wesleyan
just
like
herself
she
would
have
been
sure
that
he
was
her
notions
of
wesleyanism
with
her
notions
of
various
other
things
were
sharply
modified
now
tell
me
about
you
scales
suggested
oh
i
nothing
she
burst
out
the
exclamation
was
perfectly
sincere
scales
disclosures
concerning
himself
while
they
excited
her
discouraged
her
you
the
finest
girl
i
ever
met
anyhow
said
scales
with
gallant
emphasis
and
he
dug
his
stick
into
the
soft
ground
she
blushed
and
made
no
answer
they
walked
on
in
silence
each
wondering
apprehensively
what
might
happen
next
suddenly
scales
stopped
at
a
dilapidated
low
brick
wall
built
in
a
circle
close
to
the
side
of
the
road
i
expect
that
an
old
said
he
yes
i
expect
it
is
he
picked
up
a
rather
large
stone
and
approached
the
wall
be
careful
she
enjoined
him
oh
it
all
right
he
said
lightly
let
listen
come
near
and
listen
she
reluctantly
obeyed
and
he
threw
the
stone
over
the
dirty
ruined
wall
the
top
of
which
was
about
level
with
his
hat
for
two
or
three
seconds
there
was
no
sound
then
a
faint
reverberation
echoed
from
the
depths
of
the
shaft
and
on
sophia
brain
arose
dreadful
images
of
the
ghosts
of
miners
wandering
for
ever
in
subterranean
passages
far
far
beneath
the
noise
of
the
falling
stone
had
awakened
for
her
the
secret
terrors
of
the
earth
she
could
scarcely
even
look
at
the
wall
without
a
spasm
of
fear
how
strange
said
scales
a
little
awe
in
his
voice
too
that
that
should
be
left
there
like
that
i
suppose
it
very
deep
some
of
them
are
she
trembled
i
must
just
have
a
look
he
said
and
put
his
hands
on
the
top
of
the
wall
come
away
she
cried
oh
it
all
right
he
said
again
soothingly
the
wall
as
firm
as
a
rock
and
he
took
a
slight
spring
and
looked
over
she
shrieked
loudly
she
saw
him
at
the
distant
bottom
of
the
shaft
mangled
drowning
the
ground
seemed
to
quake
under
her
feet
a
horrible
sickness
seized
her
and
she
shrieked
again
never
had
she
guessed
that
existence
could
be
such
pain
he
slid
down
from
the
wall
and
turned
to
her
no
bottom
to
be
seen
he
said
then
observing
her
transformed
face
he
came
close
to
her
with
a
superior
masculine
smile
silly
little
thing
he
said
coaxingly
endearingly
putting
forth
all
his
power
to
charm
he
perceived
at
once
that
he
had
miscalculated
the
effects
of
his
action
her
alarm
changed
swiftly
to
angry
offence
she
drew
back
with
a
haughty
gesture
as
if
he
had
intended
actually
to
touch
her
did
he
suppose
because
she
chanced
to
be
walking
with
him
that
he
had
the
right
to
address
her
familiarly
to
tease
her
to
call
her
little
thing
and
to
put
his
face
against
hers
she
resented
his
freedom
with
quick
and
passionate
indignation
she
showed
him
her
proud
back
and
nodding
head
and
wrathful
skirts
and
hurried
off
without
a
word
almost
running
as
for
him
he
was
so
startled
by
unexpected
phenomena
that
he
did
nothing
for
a
moment
merely
stood
looking
and
feeling
foolish
then
she
heard
him
in
pursuit
she
was
too
proud
to
stop
or
even
to
reduce
her
speed
i
did
mean
to
he
muttered
behind
her
no
recognition
from
her
i
suppose
i
ought
to
apologize
he
said
i
should
just
think
you
ought
she
answered
furious
well
i
do
said
he
do
stop
a
minute
i
thank
you
not
to
follow
me
mr
scales
she
paused
and
scorched
him
with
her
displeasure
then
she
went
forward
and
her
heart
was
in
torture
because
it
could
not
persuade
her
to
remain
with
him
and
smile
and
forgive
and
win
his
smile
i
shall
write
to
you
he
shouted
down
the
slope
she
kept
on
the
ridiculous
child
but
the
agony
she
had
suffered
as
he
clung
to
the
frail
wall
was
not
ridiculous
nor
her
dark
vision
of
the
mine
nor
her
tremendous
indignation
when
after
disobeying
her
he
forgot
that
she
was
a
queen
to
her
the
scene
was
sublimely
tragic
soon
she
had
recrossed
the
bridge
but
not
the
same
she
so
this
was
the
end
of
the
incredible
adventure
when
she
reached
the
turnpike
she
thought
of
her
mother
and
of
constance
she
had
completely
forgotten
them
for
a
space
they
had
utterly
ceased
to
exist
for
her
iv
you
been
out
sophia
said
baines
in
the
parlour
questioningly
sophia
had
taken
off
her
hat
and
mantle
hurriedly
in
the
room
for
she
was
in
danger
of
being
late
for
tea
but
her
hair
and
face
showed
traces
of
the
march
breeze
baines
whose
stoutness
seemed
to
increase
sat
in
the
with
a
number
of
the
sunday
at
home
in
her
hand
tea
was
set
yes
mother
i
called
to
see
miss
chetwynd
i
wish
you
tell
me
when
you
are
going
out
i
looked
all
over
for
you
before
i
started
no
you
did
for
i
have
stirred
from
this
room
since
four
you
should
not
say
things
like
that
baines
added
in
a
gentler
tone
baines
had
suffered
much
that
day
she
knew
that
she
was
in
an
irritable
nervous
state
and
therefore
she
said
to
herself
in
her
quality
of
wise
woman
i
must
watch
myself
i
must
let
myself
go
and
she
thought
how
reasonable
she
was
she
did
not
guess
that
all
her
gestures
betrayed
her
nor
did
it
occur
to
her
that
few
things
are
more
galling
than
the
spectacle
of
a
person
actuated
by
lofty
motives
obviously
trying
to
be
kind
and
patient
under
what
he
considers
to
be
extreme
provocation
maggie
blundered
up
the
kitchen
stairs
with
the
teapot
and
hot
toast
and
so
sophia
had
an
excuse
for
silence
sophia
too
had
suffered
much
suffered
excruciatingly
she
carried
at
that
moment
a
whole
tragedy
in
her
young
soul
unaccustomed
to
such
burdens
her
attitude
towards
her
mother
was
half
fearful
and
half
defiant
it
might
be
summed
up
in
the
phrase
which
she
had
repeated
again
and
again
under
her
breath
on
the
way
home
well
mother
ca
kill
me
baines
put
down
the
magazine
and
twisted
her
towards
the
table
you
can
pour
out
the
tea
said
baines
where
constance
she
not
very
well
she
lying
down
anything
the
matter
with
her
no
this
was
inaccurate
nearly
everything
was
the
matter
with
constance
who
had
never
been
less
constance
than
during
that
afternoon
but
baines
had
no
intention
of
discussing
constance
with
sophia
the
less
said
to
sophia
about
love
the
better
sophia
was
excitable
enough
already
they
sat
opposite
to
each
other
on
either
side
of
the
fire
the
monumental
matron
whose
black
bodice
heavily
overhung
the
table
whose
large
rounded
face
was
creased
and
wrinkled
by
what
seemed
countless
years
of
joy
and
disillusion
and
the
young
slim
girl
so
fresh
so
virginal
so
ignorant
with
all
the
pathos
of
an
unsuspecting
victim
about
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
minotaur
of
time
they
both
ate
hot
toast
with
careless
haste
in
silence
preoccupied
worried
and
outwardly
nonchalant
and
what
has
miss
chetwynd
got
to
say
baines
inquired
she
was
in
here
was
a
blow
for
baines
whose
suspicions
about
sophia
driven
off
by
her
certainties
regarding
constance
suddenly
sprang
forward
in
her
mind
and
prowled
to
and
fro
like
a
band
of
tigers
still
baines
was
determined
to
be
calm
and
careful
oh
what
time
did
you
call
i
do
know
about
four
sophia
finished
her
tea
quickly
and
rose
shall
i
tell
povey
he
can
come
povey
had
his
tea
after
the
ladies
of
the
house
yes
if
you
will
stay
in
the
shop
till
i
come
light
me
the
gas
before
you
go
sophia
took
a
wax
taper
from
a
vase
on
the
mantelpiece
stuck
it
in
the
fire
and
lit
the
gas
which
exploded
in
its
crystal
cloister
with
a
mild
report
what
all
that
clay
on
your
boots
child
asked
baines
clay
repeated
sophia
staring
foolishly
at
her
boots
yes
said
baines
it
looks
like
marl
where
on
earth
have
you
been
she
interrogated
her
daughter
with
an
upward
gaze
frigid
and
unconsciously
hostile
through
her
glasses
i
must
have
picked
it
up
on
the
roads
said
sophia
and
hastened
to
the
door
sophia
yes
mother
shut
the
door
sophia
unwillingly
shut
the
door
which
she
had
half
opened
come
here
sophia
obeyed
with
falling
lip
you
are
deceiving
me
sophia
said
baines
with
fierce
solemnity
where
have
you
been
this
afternoon
sophia
foot
was
restless
on
the
carpet
behind
the
table
i
been
anywhere
she
murmured
glumly
have
you
seen
young
scales
yes
said
sophia
with
grimness
glancing
audaciously
for
an
instant
at
her
mother
she
ca
kill
me
she
ca
kill
me
her
heart
muttered
and
she
had
youth
and
beauty
in
her
favour
while
her
mother
was
only
a
fat
woman
she
ca
kill
me
said
her
heart
with
the
trembling
cruel
insolence
of
the
child
how
came
you
to
meet
him
no
answer
sophia
you
heard
what
i
said
still
no
answer
sophia
looked
down
at
the
table
she
ca
kill
me
if
you
are
going
to
be
sullen
i
shall
have
to
suppose
the
worst
said
baines
sophia
kept
her
silence
of
course
baines
resumed
if
you
choose
to
be
wicked
neither
your
mother
nor
any
one
else
can
stop
you
there
are
certain
things
i
can
do
and
these
i
shall
do
let
me
warn
you
that
young
scales
is
a
thoroughly
bad
lot
i
know
all
about
him
he
has
been
living
a
wild
life
abroad
and
if
it
had
been
that
his
uncle
is
a
partner
in
birkinshaws
they
would
never
have
taken
him
on
again
a
pause
i
hope
that
one
day
you
will
be
a
happy
wife
but
you
are
much
too
young
yet
to
be
meeting
young
men
and
nothing
would
ever
induce
me
to
let
you
have
anything
to
do
with
this
scales
i
wo
have
it
in
future
you
are
not
to
go
out
alone
you
understand
me
sophia
kept
silence
i
hope
you
will
be
in
a
better
frame
of
mind
i
can
only
hope
so
but
if
you
are
i
shall
take
very
severe
measures
you
think
you
can
defy
me
but
you
never
were
more
mistaken
in
your
life
i
do
want
to
see
any
more
of
you
now
go
and
tell
povey
and
call
maggie
for
the
fresh
tea
you
make
me
almost
glad
that
your
father
died
even
as
he
did
he
has
at
any
rate
been
spared
this
those
words
even
as
he
did
achieved
the
intimidation
of
sophia
they
seemed
to
indicate
that
baines
though
she
had
magnanimously
never
mentioned
the
subject
to
sophia
knew
exactly
how
the
old
man
had
died
sophia
escaped
from
the
room
in
fear
cowed
nevertheless
her
thought
was
she
has
killed
me
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
talk
and
i
did
in
the
evening
as
she
sat
in
the
shop
primly
and
sternly
sewing
at
hats
while
her
mother
wept
in
secret
on
the
first
floor
and
constance
remained
hidden
on
the
second
sophia
lived
over
again
the
scene
at
the
old
shaft
but
she
lived
it
differently
admitting
that
she
had
been
wrong
guessing
by
instinct
that
she
had
shown
a
foolish
mistrust
of
love
as
she
sat
in
the
shop
she
adopted
just
the
right
attitude
and
said
just
the
right
things
instead
of
being
a
silly
baby
she
was
an
accomplished
and
dazzling
woman
then
when
customers
came
in
and
the
young
lady
assistants
unobtrusively
turned
higher
the
central
gas
according
to
the
regime
of
the
shop
it
was
really
extraordinary
that
they
could
not
read
in
the
heart
of
the
beautiful
miss
baines
the
words
which
blazed
there
you
the
finest
girl
i
ever
met
and
i
shall
write
to
you
the
young
lady
assistants
had
their
notions
as
to
both
constance
and
sophia
but
the
truth
at
least
as
regarded
sophia
was
beyond
the
flight
of
their
imaginations
when
eight
struck
and
she
gave
the
formal
order
for
the
shop
being
empty
they
never
supposed
that
she
was
dreaming
about
posts
and
plotting
how
to
get
hold
of
the
morning
letters
before
povey
chapter
vii
a
defeat
i
it
was
during
the
month
of
june
that
aunt
harriet
came
over
from
axe
to
spend
a
few
days
with
her
little
sister
baines
the
railway
between
axe
and
the
five
towns
had
not
yet
been
opened
but
even
if
it
had
been
opened
aunt
harriet
would
probably
not
have
used
it
she
had
always
travelled
from
axe
to
bursley
in
the
same
vehicle
a
small
waggonette
which
she
hired
from
bratt
livery
stables
at
axe
driven
by
a
coachman
who
thoroughly
understood
the
importance
and
the
peculiarities
of
aunt
harriet
baines
had
increased
in
stoutness
so
that
now
aunt
harriet
had
very
little
advantage
over
her
physically
but
the
moral
ascendency
of
the
elder
still
persisted
the
two
vast
widows
shared
bedroom
spending
much
of
their
time
there
in
long
hushed
conversations
interviews
from
which
baines
emerged
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
received
enlightenment
and
aunt
harriet
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
rendered
it
the
pair
went
about
together
in
the
shop
the
showroom
the
parlour
the
kitchen
and
also
into
the
town
addressing
each
other
as
everywhere
it
was
sister
dear
mother
aunt
harriet
they
referred
to
each
other
as
oracular
sources
of
wisdom
and
good
taste
respectability
stalked
abroad
when
they
were
afoot
the
whole
square
wriggled
uneasily
as
though
god
eye
were
peculiarly
upon
it
the
meals
in
the
parlour
became
solemn
collations
at
which
shone
the
best
silver
and
the
finest
diaper
but
from
which
gaiety
and
naturalness
seemed
to
be
banished
i
say
because
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
aunt
harriet
was
natural
and
there
were
moments
when
she
possibly
considered
herself
to
be
practising
gaiety
a
gaiety
more
desolating
than
her
severity
the
younger
generation
was
extinguished
pressed
flat
and
lifeless
under
the
ponderosity
of
the
widows
povey
was
not
the
man
to
be
easily
flattened
by
ponderosity
of
any
kind
and
his
suppression
was
a
striking
proof
of
the
prowess
of
the
widows
who
indeed
went
over
povey
like
with
the
sublime
unconsciousness
of
leaving
an
inanimate
object
in
the
road
behind
them
and
scarce
aware
even
of
the
jolt
povey
hated
aunt
harriet
but
lying
crushed
there
in
the
road
how
could
he
rebel
he
felt
all
the
time
that
aunt
harriet
was
adding
him
up
and
reporting
the
result
at
frequent
intervals
to
baines
in
the
bedroom
he
felt
that
she
knew
everything
about
him
even
to
those
tears
which
had
been
in
his
eyes
he
felt
that
he
could
hope
to
do
nothing
right
for
aunt
harriet
that
absolute
perfection
in
the
performance
of
duty
would
make
no
more
impression
on
her
than
a
caress
on
the
of
a
constance
the
dear
constance
was
also
looked
at
askance
there
was
nothing
in
aunt
demeanour
to
her
that
you
could
take
hold
of
but
there
was
emphatically
something
that
you
could
not
take
hold
of
a
hint
an
inkling
that
insinuated
to
constance
have
a
care
lest
peradventure
you
become
the
second
cousin
of
the
scarlet
woman
sophia
was
petted
sophia
was
liable
to
be
playfully
tapped
by
aunt
harriet
thimble
when
aunt
harriet
was
hemming
dusters
for
the
elderly
lady
could
lift
a
duster
to
her
own
dignity
sophia
was
called
on
two
separate
occasions
little
butterfly
and
sophia
was
entrusted
with
the
trimming
of
aunt
harriet
new
summer
bonnet
aunt
harriet
deemed
that
sophia
was
looking
pale
as
the
days
passed
sophia
pallor
was
emphasized
by
aunt
harriet
until
it
developed
into
an
article
of
faith
to
which
you
were
compelled
to
subscribe
on
pain
of
excommunication
then
dawned
the
day
when
aunt
harriet
said
staring
at
sophia
as
an
affectionate
aunt
may
that
child
would
do
with
a
change
and
then
there
dawned
another
day
when
aunt
harriet
staring
at
sophia
compassionately
as
a
devoted
aunt
may
said
it
a
pity
that
child
ca
have
a
change
and
baines
also
stared
and
said
it
is
and
on
another
day
aunt
harriet
said
i
been
wondering
whether
my
little
sophia
would
care
to
come
and
keep
her
old
aunt
company
a
while
there
were
few
things
for
which
sophia
would
have
cared
less
the
girl
swore
to
herself
angrily
that
she
would
not
go
that
no
allurement
would
induce
her
to
go
but
she
was
in
a
net
she
was
in
the
meshes
of
family
correctness
do
what
she
would
she
could
not
invent
a
reason
for
not
going
certainly
she
could
not
tell
her
aunt
that
she
merely
did
not
want
to
go
she
was
capable
of
enormities
but
not
of
that
and
then
began
aunt
harriet
intricate
preparations
for
going
aunt
harriet
never
did
anything
simply
and
she
could
not
be
hurried
hours
before
leaving
she
had
to
commence
upon
her
trunk
but
first
the
trunk
had
to
be
wiped
by
maggie
with
a
damp
cloth
under
the
eye
and
direction
of
aunt
harriet
and
the
liveryman
at
axe
had
to
be
written
to
and
the
servants
at
axe
written
to
and
the
weather
prospects
weighed
and
considered
and
somehow
by
the
time
these
matters
were
accomplished
it
was
tacitly
understood
that
sophia
should
accompany
her
kind
aunt
into
the
bracing
moorland
air
of
axe
no
smoke
at
axe
no
stuffiness
at
axe
the
spacious
existence
of
a
wealthy
widow
in
a
residential
town
with
a
low
and
famous
scenery
have
you
packed
your
box
sophia
no
she
had
not
well
i
will
come
and
help
you
impossible
to
bear
up
against
the
momentum
of
a
massive
body
like
aunt
harriet
it
was
irresistible
the
day
of
departure
came
throwing
the
entire
household
into
a
commotion
dinner
was
put
a
quarter
of
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
so
that
aunt
harriet
might
achieve
axe
at
her
accustomed
hour
of
tea
after
dinner
maggie
was
the
recipient
of
three
amazing
muslin
aprons
given
with
a
regal
gesture
and
the
trunk
and
the
box
were
brought
down
and
there
was
a
slight
odour
of
black
kid
gloves
in
the
parlour
the
waggonette
was
due
and
the
waggonette
appeared
i
can
always
rely
upon
bladen
said
aunt
harriet
and
the
door
was
opened
and
bladen
stiff
on
his
legs
descended
from
the
box
and
touched
his
hat
to
aunt
harriet
as
she
filled
up
the
doorway
have
you
baited
bladen
asked
she
yes
said
he
assuringly
bladen
and
povey
carried
out
the
trunk
and
the
box
and
constance
charged
herself
with
parcels
which
she
bestowed
in
the
corners
of
the
vehicle
according
to
her
aunt
prescription
it
was
like
stowing
the
cargo
of
a
vessel
now
sophia
my
chuck
baines
called
up
the
stairs
and
sophia
came
slowly
downstairs
baines
offered
her
mouth
sophia
glanced
at
her
you
need
think
i
do
see
why
you
sending
me
away
exclaimed
sophia
in
a
hard
furious
voice
with
glistening
eyes
i
not
so
blind
as
all
that
she
kissed
her
mother
nothing
but
a
contemptuous
peck
then
as
she
turned
away
she
added
but
you
let
constance
do
just
as
she
likes
this
was
her
sole
bitter
comment
on
the
episode
but
into
it
she
put
all
the
profound
bitterness
accumulated
during
many
mutinous
nights
baines
concealed
a
sigh
the
explosion
certainly
disturbed
her
she
had
hoped
that
the
smooth
surface
of
things
would
not
be
ruffled
sophia
bounced
out
and
the
assembly
including
several
urchins
watched
with
held
breath
while
aunt
harriet
after
having
bid
majestic
got
on
to
the
step
and
introduced
herself
through
the
doorway
of
the
waggonette
into
the
interior
of
the
vehicle
it
was
an
operation
like
threading
a
needle
with
cotton
too
thick
once
within
her
hoops
distended
in
sudden
release
filling
the
waggonette
sophia
followed
agilely
as
with
due
formalities
the
equipage
drove
off
baines
gave
another
sigh
one
of
relief
the
sisters
had
won
she
could
now
await
the
imminent
next
advent
of
gerald
scales
with
tranquillity
ii
those
singular
words
of
sophia
you
let
constance
do
just
as
she
likes
had
disturbed
baines
more
than
was
at
first
apparent
they
worried
her
like
a
late
fly
in
autumn
for
she
had
said
nothing
to
any
one
about
constance
case
maddack
of
course
excepted
she
had
instinctively
felt
that
she
could
not
show
the
slightest
leniency
towards
the
romantic
impulses
of
her
elder
daughter
without
seeming
unjust
to
the
younger
and
she
had
acted
accordingly
on
the
memorable
morn
of
povey
acute
jealousy
she
had
temporarily
at
any
rate
slaked
the
fire
banked
it
down
and
hidden
it
and
since
then
no
word
had
passed
as
to
the
state
of
constance
heart
in
the
great
peril
to
be
feared
from
scales
constance
heart
had
been
put
aside
as
a
thing
that
could
wait
so
one
puts
aside
the
mending
of
linen
when
earthquake
shocks
are
about
baines
was
sure
that
constance
had
not
chattered
to
sophia
concerning
povey
constance
who
understood
her
mother
had
too
much
commonsense
and
too
nice
a
sense
of
propriety
to
do
that
and
yet
here
was
sophia
exclaiming
you
let
constance
do
just
as
she
likes
were
the
relations
between
constance
and
povey
then
common
property
did
the
young
lady
assistants
discuss
them
as
a
fact
the
young
lady
assistants
did
discuss
them
not
in
the
shop
for
either
one
of
the
principal
parties
or
baines
herself
was
always
in
the
shop
but
elsewhere
they
discussed
little
else
when
they
were
free
how
she
had
looked
at
him
and
how
he
had
blushed
and
so
forth
interminably
yet
baines
really
thought
that
she
alone
knew
such
is
the
power
of
the
ineradicable
delusion
that
one
own
affairs
and
especially
one
own
children
are
mysteriously
different
from
those
of
others
after
sophia
departure
baines
surveyed
her
daughter
and
her
manager
at
with
a
curious
and
a
diffident
eye
they
worked
talked
and
ate
just
as
though
baines
had
never
caught
them
weeping
together
in
the
room
they
had
the
most
air
they
might
never
have
heard
whispered
the
name
of
love
and
there
could
be
no
deceit
beneath
that
decorum
for
constance
would
not
deceive
still
baines
conscience
was
unruly
order
reigned
but
nevertheless
she
knew
that
she
ought
to
do
something
find
out
something
decide
something
she
ought
if
she
did
her
duty
to
take
constance
aside
and
say
now
constance
my
mind
is
freer
now
tell
me
frankly
what
has
been
going
on
between
you
and
povey
i
have
never
understood
the
meaning
of
that
scene
in
the
room
tell
me
she
ought
to
have
talked
in
this
strain
but
she
could
not
that
energetic
woman
had
not
sufficient
energy
left
she
wanted
rest
rest
even
though
it
were
a
coward
rest
an
tranquillity
after
the
turmoil
of
apprehensions
caused
by
sophia
her
soul
cried
out
for
peace
she
was
not
however
to
have
peace
on
the
very
first
sunday
after
sophia
departure
povey
did
not
go
to
chapel
in
the
morning
and
he
offered
no
reason
for
his
unusual
conduct
he
ate
his
breakfast
with
appetite
but
there
was
something
peculiar
in
his
glance
that
made
baines
a
little
uneasy
this
something
she
could
not
seize
upon
and
define
when
she
and
constance
returned
from
chapel
povey
was
playing
rock
of
ages
on
the
harmonium
again
unusual
the
serious
part
of
the
dinner
comprised
roast
beef
and
yorkshire
pudding
the
pudding
being
served
as
a
sweet
course
before
the
meat
baines
ate
freely
of
these
things
for
she
loved
them
and
she
was
always
hungry
after
a
sermon
she
also
did
well
with
the
cheshire
cheese
her
intention
was
to
sleep
in
the
after
the
repast
on
sunday
afternoons
she
invariably
tried
to
sleep
in
the
and
she
did
not
often
fail
as
a
rule
the
girls
accompanied
her
thither
from
the
table
and
either
down
likewise
or
crept
out
of
the
room
when
they
perceived
the
gradual
sinking
of
the
majestic
form
into
the
deep
hollows
of
the
baines
was
anticipating
with
pleasure
her
somnolent
sunday
afternoon
constance
said
grace
after
meat
and
the
formula
on
this
particular
occasion
ran
thus
thank
god
for
our
good
dinner
mother
i
must
just
run
upstairs
to
my
room
being
far
away
and
off
she
ran
strangely
girlish
well
child
you
need
be
in
such
a
hurry
said
baines
ringing
the
bell
and
rising
she
hoped
that
constance
would
remember
the
conditions
precedent
to
sleep
i
should
like
to
have
a
word
with
you
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
baines
said
povey
suddenly
with
obvious
nervousness
and
his
tone
struck
a
rude
unexpected
blow
at
baines
peace
of
mind
it
was
a
portentous
tone
what
about
asked
she
with
an
inflection
subtly
to
remind
povey
what
day
it
was
about
constance
said
the
astonishing
man
constance
exclaimed
baines
with
a
histrionic
air
of
bewilderment
maggie
entered
the
room
solely
in
response
to
the
bell
yet
a
thought
jumped
up
in
baines
brain
how
prying
servants
are
to
be
sure
for
quite
five
seconds
she
had
a
grievance
against
maggie
she
was
compelled
to
sit
down
again
and
wait
while
maggie
cleared
the
table
povey
put
both
his
hands
in
his
pockets
got
up
went
to
the
window
whistled
and
generally
behaved
in
a
manner
which
foretold
the
worst
at
last
maggie
vanished
shutting
the
door
what
is
it
mr
povey
oh
said
povey
facing
her
with
absurd
nervous
brusqueness
as
though
pretending
ah
yes
we
have
something
to
say
i
was
forgetting
then
he
began
it
about
constance
and
me
yes
they
had
evidently
plotted
this
interview
constance
had
evidently
taken
herself
off
on
purpose
to
leave
povey
unhampered
they
were
in
league
the
inevitable
had
come
no
sleep
no
repose
nothing
but
worry
once
more
i
not
at
all
satisfied
with
the
present
situation
said
povey
in
a
tone
that
corresponded
to
his
words
i
do
know
what
you
mean
povey
said
baines
stiffly
this
was
a
simple
lie
well
really
mrs
baines
povey
protested
i
suppose
you
deny
that
you
know
there
is
something
between
me
and
constance
i
suppose
you
wo
deny
that
what
is
there
between
you
and
constance
i
can
assure
you
i
that
depends
on
you
povey
interrupted
her
when
he
was
nervous
his
manners
deteriorated
into
a
behaviour
that
resembled
rudeness
that
depends
on
you
he
repeated
grimly
but
are
we
to
be
engaged
or
are
we
not
pursued
povey
as
though
baines
had
been
guilty
of
some
grave
lapse
and
he
was
determined
not
to
spare
her
that
what
i
think
ought
to
be
settled
one
way
or
the
other
i
wish
to
be
perfectly
open
and
aboveboard
in
the
future
as
i
have
been
in
the
past
but
you
have
said
nothing
to
me
at
all
baines
remonstrated
lifting
her
eyebrows
the
way
in
which
the
man
had
sprung
this
matter
upon
her
was
truly
too
audacious
povey
approached
her
as
she
sat
at
the
table
shaking
her
ringlets
and
looking
at
her
hands
you
know
there
something
between
us
he
insisted
how
should
i
know
there
is
something
between
you
constance
has
never
said
a
word
to
me
and
have
you
well
said
he
we
hidden
nothing
what
is
there
between
you
and
constance
if
i
may
ask
that
depends
on
you
said
he
again
have
you
asked
her
to
be
your
wife
no
i
have
exactly
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
he
hesitated
you
see
baines
collected
her
forces
have
you
kissed
her
this
in
a
cold
voice
povey
now
blushed
i
have
exactly
kissed
her
he
stammered
apparently
shocked
by
the
inquisition
no
i
should
not
say
that
i
had
kissed
her
it
might
have
been
that
before
committing
himself
he
felt
a
desire
for
baines
definition
of
a
kiss
you
are
very
extraordinary
she
said
loftily
it
was
no
less
than
the
truth
all
i
want
to
know
is
have
you
got
anything
against
me
he
demanded
roughly
because
if
so
anything
against
you
povey
why
should
i
have
anything
against
you
then
why
ca
we
be
engaged
she
considered
that
he
was
bullying
her
that
another
question
said
she
why
ca
we
be
engaged
ai
i
good
enough
the
fact
was
that
he
was
not
regarded
as
good
enough
maddack
had
certainly
deemed
that
he
was
not
good
enough
he
was
a
solid
mass
of
excellent
qualities
but
he
lacked
brilliance
importance
dignity
he
could
not
impose
himself
such
had
been
the
verdict
and
now
while
baines
was
secretly
reproaching
povey
for
his
inability
to
impose
himself
he
was
most
patently
imposing
himself
on
her
and
the
phenomenon
escaped
her
she
felt
that
he
was
bullying
her
but
somehow
she
could
not
perceive
his
power
yet
the
man
who
could
bully
baines
was
surely
no
common
soul
you
know
my
very
high
opinion
of
you
she
said
povey
pursued
in
a
mollified
tone
assuming
that
constance
is
willing
to
be
engaged
do
i
understand
you
consent
but
constance
is
too
young
constance
is
twenty
she
is
more
than
twenty
in
any
case
you
wo
expect
me
to
give
you
an
answer
now
why
not
you
know
my
position
she
did
from
a
practical
point
of
view
the
match
would
be
ideal
no
fault
could
be
found
with
it
on
that
side
but
baines
could
not
extinguish
the
idea
that
it
would
be
a
for
her
daughter
who
after
all
was
povey
povey
was
nobody
i
must
think
things
over
she
said
firmly
putting
her
lips
together
i
ca
reply
like
this
it
is
a
serious
matter
when
can
i
have
your
answer
no
really
in
a
week
then
i
can
not
bind
myself
to
a
date
said
baines
haughtily
she
felt
that
she
was
gaining
ground
because
i
ca
stay
on
here
indefinitely
as
things
are
povey
burst
out
and
there
was
a
touch
of
hysteria
in
his
tone
now
povey
please
do
be
reasonable
that
all
very
well
he
went
on
that
all
very
well
but
what
i
say
is
that
employers
have
no
right
to
have
male
assistants
in
their
houses
unless
they
are
prepared
to
let
their
daughters
marry
what
i
say
no
right
baines
did
not
know
what
to
answer
the
aspirant
wound
up
i
must
leave
if
that
the
case
if
what
the
case
she
asked
herself
what
has
come
over
him
and
aloud
you
know
you
would
place
me
in
a
very
awkward
position
by
leaving
and
i
hope
you
do
want
to
mix
up
two
quite
different
things
i
hope
you
are
trying
to
threaten
me
threaten
you
he
cried
do
you
suppose
i
should
leave
here
for
fun
if
i
leave
it
will
be
because
i
ca
stand
it
that
all
i
stand
it
i
want
constance
and
if
i
ca
have
her
then
i
ca
stand
it
what
do
you
think
i
made
of
i
sure
she
began
that
all
very
well
he
almost
shouted
but
please
let
me
speak
she
said
quietly
all
i
say
is
i
ca
stand
it
that
all
employers
have
no
right
we
have
our
feelings
like
other
men
he
was
deeply
moved
he
might
have
appeared
somewhat
grotesque
to
the
strictly
impartial
observer
of
human
nature
nevertheless
he
was
deeply
and
genuinely
moved
and
possibly
human
nature
could
have
shown
nothing
more
human
than
povey
at
the
moment
when
unable
any
longer
to
restrain
the
paroxysm
which
had
so
surprisingly
overtaken
him
he
fled
from
the
parlour
passionately
to
the
retreat
of
his
bedroom
that
the
worst
of
those
quiet
calm
ones
said
baines
to
herself
you
never
know
if
they
wo
give
way
and
when
they
do
awful
awful
what
did
i
do
what
did
i
say
to
bring
it
on
nothing
nothing
and
where
was
her
afternoon
sleep
what
was
going
to
happen
to
her
daughter
what
could
she
say
to
constance
how
next
could
she
meet
povey
ah
it
needed
a
brave
indomitable
woman
not
to
cry
out
brokenly
i
suffered
too
much
do
anything
you
like
only
let
me
die
in
peace
and
so
saying
to
let
everything
indifferently
slide
iii
neither
povey
nor
constance
introduced
the
delicate
subject
to
her
again
and
she
was
determined
not
to
be
the
first
to
speak
of
it
she
considered
that
povey
had
taken
advantage
of
his
position
and
that
he
had
also
been
infantile
and
impolite
and
somehow
she
privately
blamed
constance
for
his
behaviour
so
the
matter
hung
as
it
were
suspended
in
the
ether
between
the
opposing
forces
of
pride
and
passion
shortly
afterwards
events
occurred
compared
to
which
the
vicissitudes
of
povey
heart
were
of
no
more
account
than
a
shower
of
rain
in
april
and
fate
gave
no
warning
of
them
it
rather
indicated
a
complete
absence
of
events
when
the
customary
advice
circular
arrived
from
birkinshaws
the
name
of
gerald
scales
was
replaced
on
it
by
another
and
an
unfamiliar
name
baines
seeing
the
circular
by
accident
experienced
a
sense
of
relief
mingled
with
the
professional
disappointment
of
a
diplomatist
who
has
elaborately
provided
for
contingencies
which
have
failed
to
happen
she
had
sent
sophia
away
for
nothing
and
no
doubt
her
maternal
affection
had
exaggerated
a
molehill
into
a
mountain
really
when
she
reflected
on
the
past
she
could
not
recall
a
single
fact
that
would
justify
her
theory
of
an
attachment
secretly
budding
between
sophia
and
the
young
man
scales
not
a
single
little
fact
all
she
could
bring
forward
was
that
sophia
had
twice
encountered
scales
in
the
street
she
felt
a
curious
interest
in
the
fate
of
scales
for
whom
in
her
own
mind
she
had
long
prophesied
evil
and
when
birkinshaws
representative
came
she
took
care
to
be
in
the
shop
her
intention
was
to
converse
with
him
and
ascertain
as
much
as
was
ascertainable
after
povey
had
transacted
business
for
this
purpose
at
a
suitable
moment
she
traversed
the
shop
to
povey
side
and
in
so
doing
she
had
a
fleeting
view
of
king
street
and
in
king
street
of
a
familiar
vehicle
she
stopped
and
seemed
to
catch
the
distant
sound
of
knocking
abandoning
the
traveller
she
hurried
towards
the
parlour
in
the
passage
she
assuredly
did
hear
knocking
angry
and
impatient
knocking
the
knocking
of
someone
who
thinks
he
has
knocked
too
long
of
course
maggie
is
at
the
top
of
the
house
she
muttered
sarcastically
she
unchained
unbolted
and
unlocked
the
at
last
it
was
aunt
harriet
voice
exacerbated
what
you
sister
you
soon
up
what
a
blessing
the
two
majestic
and
imposing
creatures
met
on
the
mat
craning
forward
so
that
their
lips
might
meet
above
their
terrific
bosoms
what
the
matter
baines
asked
fearfully
well
i
do
declare
said
maddack
and
i
driven
specially
over
to
ask
you
where
sophia
demanded
baines
you
do
mean
to
say
she
not
come
sister
maddack
sank
down
on
to
the
sofa
come
baines
repeated
of
course
she
not
come
what
do
you
mean
sister
the
very
moment
she
got
constance
letter
yesterday
saying
you
were
ill
in
bed
and
she
better
come
over
to
help
in
the
shop
she
started
i
got
bratt
for
her
baines
in
her
turn
also
sank
down
on
to
the
sofa
i
not
been
ill
she
said
and
constance
has
written
for
a
week
only
yesterday
i
was
telling
her
sister
it
ca
be
sophia
had
letters
from
constance
every
morning
at
least
she
said
they
were
from
constance
i
told
her
to
be
sure
and
write
me
how
you
were
last
night
and
she
promised
faithfully
she
would
and
it
was
because
i
got
nothing
by
this
morning
post
that
i
decided
to
come
over
myself
to
see
if
it
was
anything
serious
serious
it
is
murmured
baines
what
sophia
run
off
that
the
plain
english
of
it
said
baines
with
frigid
calm
nay
that
i
never
believe
i
looked
after
sophia
night
and
day
as
if
she
was
my
own
and
if
she
has
run
off
where
is
she
maddack
opened
the
door
with
a
tragic
gesture
bladen
she
called
in
a
loud
voice
to
the
driver
of
the
waggonette
who
was
standing
on
the
pavement
yes
it
was
pember
drove
miss
sophia
yesterday
was
it
yes
she
hesitated
a
clumsy
question
might
enlighten
a
member
of
the
class
which
ought
never
to
be
enlightened
about
one
private
affairs
he
did
come
all
the
way
here
no
he
happened
to
say
last
night
when
he
got
back
as
miss
sophia
had
told
him
to
set
her
down
at
knype
station
i
thought
so
said
maddack
courageously
yes
sister
she
moaned
after
carefully
shutting
the
door
they
clung
to
each
other
the
horror
of
what
had
occurred
did
not
instantly
take
full
possession
of
them
because
the
power
of
credence
of
imaginatively
realizing
a
supreme
event
whether
of
great
grief
or
of
great
happiness
is
ridiculously
finite
but
every
minute
the
horror
grew
more
clear
more
intense
more
tragically
dominant
over
them
there
were
many
things
that
they
could
not
say
to
each
other
from
pride
from
shame
from
the
inadequacy
of
words
neither
could
utter
the
name
of
gerald
scales
and
aunt
harriet
could
not
stoop
to
defend
herself
from
a
possible
charge
of
neglect
nor
could
baines
stoop
to
assure
her
sister
that
she
was
incapable
of
preferring
such
a
charge
and
the
sheer
immense
criminal
folly
of
sophia
could
not
even
be
referred
to
it
was
unspeakable
so
the
interview
proceeded
lamely
clumsily
inconsequently
leading
to
naught
sophia
was
gone
she
was
gone
with
gerald
scales
that
beautiful
child
that
incalculable
untamable
impossible
creature
had
committed
the
final
folly
without
pretext
or
excuse
and
with
what
elaborate
deceit
yes
without
excuse
she
had
not
been
treated
harshly
she
had
had
a
degree
of
liberty
which
would
have
astounded
and
shocked
her
grandmothers
she
had
been
petted
humoured
spoilt
and
her
answer
was
to
disgrace
the
family
by
an
act
as
irrevocable
as
it
was
utterly
vicious
if
among
her
desires
was
the
desire
to
humiliate
those
majesties
her
mother
and
aunt
harriet
she
would
have
been
content
could
she
have
seen
them
on
the
sofa
there
humbled
shamed
mortally
wounded
ah
the
monstrous
chinese
cruelty
of
youth
what
was
to
be
done
tell
dear
constance
no
this
was
not
at
the
moment
an
affair
for
the
younger
generation
it
was
too
new
and
raw
for
the
younger
generation
moreover
capable
proud
and
experienced
as
they
were
they
felt
the
need
of
a
man
voice
and
a
man
hard
callous
ideas
it
was
a
case
for
critchlow
maggie
was
sent
to
fetch
him
with
a
particular
request
that
he
should
come
to
the
he
came
expectant
with
the
pleasurable
anticipation
of
disaster
and
he
was
not
disappointed
he
passed
with
the
sisters
the
happiest
hour
that
had
fallen
to
him
for
years
quickly
he
arranged
the
alternatives
for
them
would
they
tell
the
police
or
would
they
take
the
risks
of
waiting
they
shied
away
but
with
fierce
brutality
he
brought
them
again
and
again
to
the
immediate
point
of
decision
well
they
could
not
tell
the
police
they
simply
could
not
then
they
must
face
another
danger
he
had
no
mercy
for
them
and
while
he
was
torturing
them
there
arrived
a
telegram
despatched
from
charing
cross
i
am
all
right
sophia
that
proved
at
any
rate
that
the
child
was
not
heartless
not
merely
careless
only
yesterday
it
seemed
to
baines
she
had
borne
sophia
only
yesterday
she
was
a
baby
a
schoolgirl
to
be
smacked
the
years
rolled
up
in
a
few
hours
and
now
she
was
sending
telegrams
from
a
place
called
charing
cross
how
unlike
was
the
hand
of
the
telegram
to
sophia
hand
how
mysteriously
curt
and
inhuman
was
that
official
hand
as
baines
stared
at
it
through
red
wet
eyes
critchlow
said
some
one
should
go
to
manchester
to
ascertain
about
scales
he
went
himself
that
afternoon
and
returned
with
the
news
that
an
aunt
of
scales
had
recently
died
leaving
him
twelve
thousand
pounds
and
that
he
had
after
quarrelling
with
his
uncle
boldero
abandoned
birkinshaws
at
an
hour
notice
and
vanished
with
his
inheritance
it
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
said
critchlow
i
could
ha
warned
ye
o
all
this
years
ago
even
since
she
killed
her
father
critchlow
left
nothing
unsaid
during
the
night
baines
lived
through
all
sophia
life
lived
through
it
more
intensely
than
ever
sophia
had
done
the
next
day
people
began
to
know
a
whisper
almost
inaudible
went
across
the
square
and
into
the
town
and
in
the
stillness
every
one
heard
it
sophia
baines
run
off
with
a
commercial
in
another
fortnight
a
note
came
also
dated
from
london
dear
mother
i
am
married
to
gerald
scales
please
do
worry
about
me
we
are
going
abroad
your
affectionate
sophia
love
to
constance
no
on
that
pale
blue
sheet
no
sign
of
agitation
and
baines
said
my
life
is
over
it
was
though
she
was
scarcely
fifty
she
felt
old
old
and
beaten
she
had
fought
and
been
vanquished
the
everlasting
purpose
had
been
too
much
for
her
virtue
had
gone
out
of
her
the
virtue
to
hold
up
her
head
and
look
the
square
in
the
face
she
the
wife
of
john
baines
she
a
syme
of
axe
old
houses
in
the
course
of
their
history
see
sad
sights
and
never
forget
them
and
ever
since
in
the
solemn
physiognomy
of
the
triple
house
of
john
baines
at
the
corner
of
luke
square
and
king
street
have
remained
the
traces
of
the
sight
it
saw
on
the
morning
of
the
afternoon
when
and
povey
returned
from
their
honeymoon
the
sight
of
baines
getting
into
the
waggonette
for
axe
baines
encumbered
with
trunks
and
parcels
leaving
the
scene
of
her
struggles
and
her
defeat
whither
she
had
once
come
as
slim
as
a
wand
to
return
stout
and
heavy
and
to
her
childhood
content
to
live
with
her
grandiose
sister
until
such
time
as
she
should
be
ready
for
burial
the
grimy
and
impassive
old
house
perhaps
heard
her
heart
saying
only
yesterday
they
were
little
girls
ever
so
tiny
and
now
the
of
a
waggonette
can
be
a
dreadful
thing
book
ii
constance
chapter
i
revolution
i
well
said
povey
rising
from
the
that
in
a
previous
age
had
been
john
baines
i
got
to
make
a
start
some
time
so
i
may
as
well
begin
now
and
he
went
from
the
parlour
into
the
shop
constance
eye
followed
him
as
far
as
the
door
where
their
glances
met
for
an
instant
in
the
transient
gaze
which
expresses
the
tenderness
of
people
who
feel
more
than
they
kiss
it
was
on
the
morning
of
this
day
that
baines
relinquishing
the
sovereignty
of
luke
square
had
gone
to
live
as
a
younger
sister
in
the
house
of
harriet
maddack
at
axe
constance
guessed
little
of
the
secret
anguish
of
that
departure
she
only
knew
that
it
was
just
like
her
mother
having
perfectly
arranged
the
entire
house
for
the
arrival
of
the
honeymoon
couple
from
buxton
to
flit
early
away
so
as
to
spare
the
natural
blushing
diffidence
of
the
said
couple
it
was
like
her
mother
commonsense
and
her
mother
sympathetic
comprehension
further
constance
did
not
pursue
her
mother
feelings
being
far
too
busy
with
her
own
she
sat
there
full
of
new
knowledge
and
new
importance
brimming
with
experience
and
strange
unexpected
aspirations
purposes
yes
and
cunnings
and
yet
though
the
very
curves
of
her
cheeks
seemed
to
be
mysteriously
altering
the
old
constance
still
lingered
in
that
frame
an
innocent
soul
hesitating
to
spread
its
wings
and
quit
for
ever
the
body
which
had
been
its
home
you
could
see
the
timid
thing
peeping
wistfully
out
of
the
eyes
of
the
married
woman
constance
rang
the
bell
for
maggie
to
clear
the
table
and
as
she
did
so
she
had
the
illusion
that
she
was
not
really
a
married
woman
and
a
but
only
a
kind
of
counterfeit
she
did
most
fervently
hope
that
all
would
go
right
in
the
house
at
any
rate
until
she
had
grown
more
accustomed
to
her
situation
the
hope
was
to
be
disappointed
maggie
rather
silly
obsequious
smile
concealed
but
for
a
moment
the
ineffable
tragedy
that
had
lain
in
wait
for
unarmed
constance
if
you
please
povey
said
maggie
as
she
crushed
cups
together
on
the
tin
tray
with
her
great
red
hands
which
always
looked
like
something
out
of
a
butcher
shop
then
a
pause
will
you
please
accept
of
this
now
before
the
wedding
maggie
had
already
with
tears
of
affection
given
constance
a
pair
of
blue
glass
vases
in
order
to
purchase
which
she
had
been
obliged
to
ask
for
special
permission
to
go
out
and
constance
wondered
what
was
coming
now
from
maggie
pocket
a
small
piece
of
folded
paper
came
from
maggie
pocket
constance
accepted
of
it
and
read
i
begs
to
give
one
month
notice
to
leave
signed
maggie
june
maggie
exclaimed
the
old
constance
terrified
by
this
incredible
occurrence
ere
the
married
woman
could
strangle
her
i
never
give
notice
before
povey
said
maggie
so
i
do
know
as
i
know
how
it
ought
for
be
done
not
rightly
but
i
hope
as
accept
of
it
mrs
povey
oh
of
course
said
povey
primly
just
as
if
maggie
was
not
the
central
supporting
pillar
of
the
house
just
as
if
maggie
had
not
assisted
at
her
birth
just
as
if
the
end
of
the
world
had
not
abruptly
been
announced
just
as
if
luke
square
were
not
inconceivable
without
maggie
but
why
well
povey
i
been
it
over
in
my
kitchen
and
i
said
to
myself
there
going
to
be
one
change
there
better
be
two
i
says
not
but
what
i
would
work
my
fingers
to
the
bone
for
ye
miss
constance
here
maggie
began
to
cry
into
the
tray
constance
looked
at
her
despite
the
special
muslin
of
that
day
she
had
traces
of
the
slatternliness
of
which
baines
had
never
been
able
to
cure
her
she
was
over
forty
big
gawky
she
had
no
figure
no
charms
of
any
kind
she
was
what
was
left
of
a
woman
after
years
in
the
cave
of
a
philanthropic
family
and
in
her
cave
she
had
actually
been
thinking
things
over
constance
detected
for
the
first
time
beneath
the
dehumanized
drudge
the
stirrings
of
a
separate
and
perhaps
capricious
individuality
maggie
engagements
had
never
been
real
to
her
employers
within
the
house
she
had
never
been
in
practice
anything
but
an
organism
and
now
she
was
permitting
herself
ideas
about
changes
you
soon
be
suited
with
another
povey
said
maggie
many
a
many
a
she
burst
into
sobs
but
if
you
really
want
to
leave
what
are
you
crying
for
maggie
asked
povey
at
her
wisest
have
you
told
mother
no
miss
maggie
whimpered
absently
wiping
her
wrinkled
cheeks
with
ineffectual
muslin
i
could
seem
to
fancy
telling
your
mother
and
as
you
the
mistress
now
i
thought
as
i
save
it
for
you
when
you
come
home
i
hope
you
excuse
me
mrs
povey
of
course
i
very
sorry
you
been
a
very
good
servant
and
in
these
days
the
child
had
acquired
this
turn
of
speech
from
her
mother
it
did
not
appear
to
occur
to
either
of
them
that
they
were
living
in
the
sixties
thank
ye
miss
and
what
are
you
thinking
of
doing
maggie
you
know
you
wo
get
many
places
like
this
to
tell
ye
the
truth
povey
i
going
to
get
married
mysen
indeed
murmured
constance
with
the
perfunctoriness
of
habit
in
replying
to
these
tidings
oh
but
i
am
mum
maggie
insisted
it
all
settled
hollins
mum
not
hollins
the
yes
mum
i
seem
to
fancy
him
you
do
remember
as
him
and
me
was
engaged
in
he
was
my
first
like
i
broke
it
off
because
he
was
in
that
chartist
lot
and
i
knew
as
baines
would
never
stand
that
now
he
asked
me
again
he
been
a
widower
this
long
time
i
sure
i
hope
you
be
happy
maggie
but
what
about
his
habits
he
wo
have
no
habits
with
me
mrs
povey
a
woman
was
definitely
emerging
from
the
drudge
when
maggie
having
entirely
ceased
sobbing
had
put
the
folded
cloth
in
the
and
departed
with
the
tray
her
mistress
became
frankly
the
girl
again
no
primness
about
her
as
she
stood
alone
there
in
the
parlour
no
pretence
that
maggie
notice
to
leave
was
an
everyday
document
to
be
casually
glanced
at
as
one
glances
at
an
unpaid
bill
she
would
be
compelled
to
find
a
new
servant
making
solemn
inquiries
into
character
and
to
train
the
new
servant
and
to
talk
to
her
from
heights
from
which
she
had
never
addressed
maggie
at
that
moment
she
had
an
illusion
that
there
were
no
other
available
suitable
servants
in
the
whole
world
and
the
arranged
marriage
she
felt
that
this
time
the
thirteenth
or
fourteenth
time
the
engagement
was
serious
and
would
only
end
at
the
altar
the
vision
of
maggie
and
hollins
at
the
altar
shocked
her
marriage
was
a
series
of
phenomena
and
a
general
state
very
holy
and
wonderful
too
sacred
somehow
for
such
creatures
as
maggie
and
hollins
her
vague
instinctive
revolt
against
such
a
usage
of
matrimony
centred
round
the
idea
of
a
strong
eternal
smell
of
fish
however
the
projected
outrage
on
a
hallowed
institution
troubled
her
much
less
than
the
imminent
problem
of
domestic
service
she
ran
into
the
shop
or
she
would
have
run
if
she
had
not
checked
her
girlishness
betimes
and
on
her
lips
ready
to
be
whispered
importantly
into
a
husband
astounded
ear
were
the
words
maggie
has
given
notice
yes
truly
but
samuel
povey
was
engaged
he
was
leaning
over
the
counter
and
staring
at
an
outspread
paper
upon
which
a
certain
yardley
was
making
strokes
with
a
thick
pencil
yardley
who
had
a
long
red
beard
painted
houses
and
rooms
she
knew
him
only
by
sight
in
her
mind
she
always
associated
him
with
the
sign
over
his
premises
in
trafalgar
road
yardley
authorised
plumbers
painters
decorators
facia
writers
for
years
in
childhood
she
had
passed
that
sign
without
knowing
what
sort
of
things
and
were
and
what
was
the
mysterious
similarity
between
a
plumber
and
a
version
of
the
bible
she
could
not
interrupt
her
husband
he
was
wholly
absorbed
nor
could
she
stay
in
the
shop
which
appeared
just
a
little
smaller
than
usual
for
that
would
have
meant
an
unsuccessful
endeavour
to
front
the
young
as
though
nothing
in
particular
had
happened
to
her
so
she
went
sedately
up
the
showroom
stairs
and
thus
to
the
bedroom
floors
of
the
house
her
house
povey
house
she
even
climbed
to
constance
old
bedroom
her
mother
had
stripped
the
bed
that
was
all
except
a
slight
diminution
of
this
room
corresponding
to
that
of
the
shop
then
to
the
in
the
recess
outside
the
door
the
black
box
of
silver
plate
still
lay
she
had
expected
her
mother
to
take
it
but
no
assuredly
her
mother
was
one
to
do
things
handsomely
when
she
did
them
in
the
not
a
tassel
of
an
antimacassar
touched
yes
the
the
luscious
bunch
of
roses
on
an
expanse
of
mustard
which
constance
had
worked
for
her
mother
years
ago
was
gone
that
her
mother
should
have
clung
to
just
that
one
souvenir
out
of
all
the
heavy
opulence
of
the
touched
constance
intimately
she
perceived
that
if
she
could
not
talk
to
her
husband
she
must
write
to
her
mother
and
she
sat
down
at
the
oval
table
and
wrote
darling
mother
i
am
sure
you
will
be
very
surprised
to
hear
she
means
it
i
think
she
is
making
a
serious
mistake
ought
i
to
put
an
advertisement
in
the
signal
or
will
it
do
if
please
write
by
return
we
are
back
and
have
enjoyed
ourselves
very
much
sam
says
he
enjoys
getting
up
late
and
so
on
to
the
last
inch
of
the
fourth
scolloped
page
she
was
obliged
to
revisit
the
shop
for
a
stamp
stamps
being
kept
in
povey
desk
in
the
corner
a
high
desk
at
which
you
stood
povey
was
now
in
earnest
converse
with
yardley
at
the
door
and
twilight
which
began
a
full
hour
earlier
in
the
shop
than
in
the
square
had
cast
faint
shadows
in
corners
behind
counters
will
you
just
run
out
with
this
to
the
pillar
miss
dadd
with
pleasure
mrs
povey
where
are
you
going
to
povey
interrupted
his
conversation
to
stop
the
flying
girl
she
just
going
to
the
post
for
me
constance
called
out
from
the
region
of
the
till
oh
all
right
a
trifle
a
nothing
yet
somehow
in
the
quiet
customerless
shop
the
episode
with
the
scarce
perceptible
difference
in
samuel
tone
at
his
second
remark
was
delicious
to
constance
somehow
it
was
the
real
beginning
of
her
wifehood
there
had
been
about
nine
other
real
beginnings
in
the
past
fortnight
povey
came
in
to
supper
laden
with
ledgers
and
similar
works
which
constance
had
never
even
pretended
to
understand
it
was
a
sign
from
him
that
the
honeymoon
was
over
he
was
proprietor
now
and
his
ardour
for
ledgers
most
justifiable
still
there
was
the
question
of
her
servant
never
he
exclaimed
when
she
told
him
all
about
the
end
of
the
world
a
which
expressed
extreme
astonishment
and
the
liveliest
concern
but
constance
had
anticipated
that
he
would
have
been
just
a
little
more
knocked
down
bowled
over
staggered
stunned
flabbergasted
in
a
swift
gleam
of
insight
she
saw
that
she
had
been
in
danger
of
forgetting
her
role
of
experienced
capable
married
woman
i
shall
have
to
set
about
getting
a
fresh
one
she
said
hastily
with
an
admirable
assumption
of
light
and
easy
casualness
povey
seemed
to
think
that
hollins
would
suit
maggie
pretty
well
he
made
no
remark
to
the
betrothed
when
she
answered
the
final
bell
of
the
night
he
opened
his
ledgers
whistling
i
think
i
shall
go
up
dear
said
constance
i
a
lot
of
things
to
put
away
do
said
he
call
out
when
you
done
ii
sam
she
cried
from
the
top
of
the
crooked
stairs
no
answer
the
door
at
the
foot
was
closed
sam
hello
distantly
faintly
i
done
all
i
going
to
do
and
she
ran
back
along
the
corridor
a
white
figure
in
the
deep
gloom
and
hurried
into
bed
and
drew
the
clothes
up
to
her
chin
in
the
life
of
a
bride
there
are
some
dramatic
moments
if
she
has
married
the
industrious
apprentice
one
of
those
moments
occurs
when
she
first
occupies
the
sacred
of
her
ancestors
and
the
bed
on
which
she
was
born
her
parents
room
had
always
been
to
constance
if
not
sacred
at
least
invested
with
a
certain
moral
solemnity
she
could
not
enter
it
as
she
would
enter
another
room
the
course
of
nature
with
its
succession
of
deaths
conceptions
and
births
slowly
makes
such
a
room
august
with
a
mysterious
quality
which
interprets
the
grandeur
of
mere
existence
and
imposes
itself
on
all
constance
had
the
strangest
sensations
in
that
bed
whose
heavy
dignity
of
ornament
symbolized
a
past
age
sensations
of
sacrilege
and
trespass
of
being
a
naughty
girl
to
whom
punishment
would
accrue
for
this
shocking
freak
not
since
she
was
quite
tiny
had
she
slept
in
that
bed
one
night
with
her
mother
before
her
father
seizure
when
he
had
been
away
what
a
limitless
unfathomable
bed
it
was
then
now
it
was
just
a
bed
so
she
had
to
tell
herself
like
any
other
bed
the
tiny
child
that
safely
touching
its
mother
had
slept
in
the
vast
expanse
seemed
to
her
now
a
pathetic
little
thing
its
image
made
her
feel
melancholy
and
her
mind
dwelt
on
sad
events
the
death
of
her
father
the
flight
of
darling
sophia
the
immense
grief
and
the
exile
of
her
mother
she
esteemed
that
she
knew
what
life
was
and
that
it
was
grim
and
she
sighed
but
the
sigh
was
an
affectation
meant
partly
to
convince
herself
that
she
was
and
partly
to
keep
her
in
countenance
in
the
intimidating
bed
this
melancholy
was
factitious
was
less
than
transient
foam
on
the
deep
sea
of
her
joy
death
and
sorrow
and
sin
were
dim
shapes
to
her
the
ruthless
egoism
of
happiness
blew
them
away
with
a
puff
and
their
wistful
faces
vanished
to
see
her
there
in
the
bed
framed
in
mahogany
and
tassels
lying
on
her
side
with
her
young
glowing
cheeks
and
honest
but
not
artless
gaze
and
the
rich
curve
of
her
hip
lifting
the
counterpane
one
would
have
said
that
she
had
never
heard
of
aught
but
love
povey
entered
the
bridegroom
quickly
firmly
carrying
it
off
rather
well
but
still
after
all
his
shoulders
were
trying
to
say
what
the
difference
between
this
bedroom
and
the
bedroom
of
a
indeed
ought
we
not
to
feel
more
at
home
here
besides
confound
it
we
been
married
a
fortnight
does
it
give
you
a
funny
feeling
sleeping
in
this
room
it
does
me
said
constance
women
even
experienced
women
are
so
foolishly
frank
they
have
no
decency
no
really
replied
povey
with
loftiness
as
who
should
say
what
an
extraordinary
thing
that
a
reasonable
creature
can
have
such
fancies
now
to
me
this
room
is
exactly
like
any
other
room
and
he
added
aloud
glancing
away
from
the
glass
where
he
was
unfastening
his
necktie
it
not
a
bad
room
at
all
this
with
the
judicial
air
of
an
auctioneer
not
for
an
instant
did
he
deceive
constance
who
read
his
real
sensations
with
accuracy
but
his
futile
poses
did
not
in
the
slightest
degree
lessen
her
respect
for
him
on
the
contrary
she
admired
him
the
more
for
them
they
were
a
sort
of
embroidery
on
the
solid
stuff
of
his
character
at
that
period
he
could
not
do
wrong
for
her
the
basis
of
her
regard
for
him
was
she
often
thought
his
honesty
his
industry
his
genuine
kindliness
of
act
his
grasp
of
the
business
his
perseverance
his
passion
for
doing
at
once
that
which
had
to
be
done
she
had
the
greatest
admiration
for
his
qualities
and
he
was
in
her
eyes
an
indivisible
whole
she
could
not
admire
one
part
of
him
and
frown
upon
another
whatever
he
did
was
good
because
he
did
it
she
knew
that
some
people
were
apt
to
smile
at
certain
phases
of
his
individuality
she
knew
that
far
down
in
her
mother
heart
was
a
suspicion
that
she
had
married
ever
so
little
beneath
her
but
this
knowledge
did
not
disturb
her
she
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
correctness
of
her
own
estimate
povey
was
an
exceedingly
methodical
person
and
he
was
also
one
of
those
persons
who
must
always
be
with
time
thus
at
night
he
would
arrange
his
raiment
so
that
in
the
morning
it
might
be
reassumed
in
the
minimum
of
minutes
he
was
not
a
man
for
example
to
leave
the
changing
of
studs
from
one
shirt
to
another
till
the
morrow
had
it
been
practicable
he
would
have
brushed
his
hair
the
night
before
constance
already
loved
to
watch
his
meticulous
preparations
she
saw
him
now
go
into
his
old
bedroom
and
return
with
a
paper
collar
which
he
put
on
the
next
to
a
black
necktie
his
was
laid
out
on
a
chair
oh
sam
she
exclaimed
impulsively
you
surely
are
going
to
begin
wearing
those
horrid
paper
collars
again
during
the
honeymoon
he
had
worn
linen
collars
her
tone
was
perfectly
gentle
but
the
remark
nevertheless
showed
a
lack
of
tact
it
implied
that
all
his
life
povey
had
been
enveloping
his
neck
in
something
which
was
horrid
like
all
persons
with
a
tendency
to
fall
into
the
ridiculous
povey
was
exceedingly
sensitive
to
personal
criticisms
he
flushed
darkly
i
did
know
they
were
he
snapped
he
was
hurt
and
angry
anger
had
surprised
him
unawares
both
of
them
suddenly
saw
that
they
were
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
chasm
and
drew
back
they
had
imagined
themselves
to
be
wandering
safely
in
a
flowered
meadow
and
here
was
this
bottomless
chasm
it
was
most
disconcerting
povey
hand
hovered
undecided
over
the
collar
however
he
muttered
she
could
feel
that
he
was
trying
with
all
his
might
to
be
gentle
and
pacific
and
she
was
aghast
at
her
own
stupid
clumsiness
she
so
experienced
just
as
you
like
dear
she
said
quickly
please
oh
no
and
he
did
his
best
to
smile
and
went
off
gawkily
with
the
collar
and
came
back
with
a
linen
one
her
passion
for
him
burned
stronger
than
ever
she
knew
then
that
she
did
not
love
him
for
his
good
qualities
but
for
something
boyish
and
naive
that
there
was
about
him
an
indescribable
something
that
occasionally
when
his
face
was
close
to
hers
made
her
dizzy
the
chasm
had
disappeared
in
such
moments
when
each
must
pretend
not
to
have
seen
or
even
suspected
the
chasm
is
essential
was
that
yardley
in
the
shop
began
constance
yes
what
did
he
want
i
sent
for
him
he
going
to
paint
us
a
signboard
useless
for
samuel
to
that
nothing
in
this
world
is
more
ordinary
than
a
signboard
oh
murmured
constance
she
said
no
more
the
episode
of
the
paper
collar
having
weakened
her
but
a
signboard
what
with
servants
chasms
and
signboards
constance
considered
that
her
life
as
a
married
woman
would
not
be
deficient
in
excitement
long
afterwards
she
fell
asleep
thinking
of
sophia
iii
a
few
days
later
constance
was
arranging
the
more
precious
of
her
wedding
presents
in
the
parlour
some
had
to
be
wrapped
in
tissue
and
in
brown
paper
and
then
tied
with
string
and
labelled
others
had
special
cases
of
their
own
leather
without
and
velvet
within
among
the
latter
was
the
resplendent
holding
twelve
and
twelve
chased
spoons
to
match
presented
by
aunt
harriet
in
the
five
towns
phrase
must
have
cost
money
even
if
and
povey
had
ten
guests
or
ten
children
and
all
the
twelve
of
them
were
simultaneously
gripped
by
a
desire
to
eat
eggs
at
breakfast
or
tea
even
in
this
remote
contingency
aunt
harriet
would
have
been
pained
to
see
the
in
use
such
treasures
are
not
designed
for
use
the
presents
few
in
number
were
mainly
of
this
character
because
owing
to
her
mother
heroic
cession
of
the
entire
interior
constance
already
possessed
every
necessary
the
fewness
of
the
presents
was
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
wedding
had
been
strictly
private
and
had
taken
place
at
axe
there
is
nothing
like
secrecy
in
marriage
for
discouraging
the
generous
impulses
of
friends
it
was
baines
abetted
by
both
the
chief
parties
who
had
decided
that
the
wedding
should
be
private
and
secluded
wedding
had
been
altogether
too
private
and
secluded
but
the
casting
of
a
veil
over
constance
whose
union
was
irreproachable
somehow
justified
after
the
event
the
circumstances
of
sophia
indicating
as
it
did
that
baines
believed
in
secret
weddings
on
principle
in
such
matters
baines
was
capable
of
extraordinary
subtlety
and
while
constance
was
thus
taking
her
wedding
presents
with
due
seriousness
maggie
was
cleaning
the
steps
that
led
from
the
pavement
of
king
street
to
the
and
the
door
was
ajar
it
was
a
fine
june
morning
suddenly
over
the
sound
of
scouring
constance
heard
a
dog
low
growl
and
then
the
hoarse
voice
of
a
man
mester
in
wench
happen
he
is
happen
he
is
came
maggie
answer
she
had
no
fancy
for
being
called
wench
constance
went
to
the
door
not
merely
from
curiosity
but
from
a
feeling
that
her
authority
and
her
responsibilities
as
extended
to
the
pavement
surrounding
the
house
the
famous
james
boon
of
buck
row
the
greatest
in
the
five
towns
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
a
tall
fat
man
clad
in
stiff
stained
brown
and
smoking
a
black
clay
pipe
less
than
three
inches
long
behind
him
attended
two
morning
missis
cried
boon
cheerfully
i
heerd
tell
as
mister
is
looking
out
for
a
dog
as
you
might
say
i
do
stay
here
with
them
animals
at
me
no
that
i
do
observed
maggie
picking
herself
up
is
he
constance
hesitated
she
knew
that
samuel
had
vaguely
referred
to
dogs
she
had
not
however
imagined
that
he
regarded
a
dog
as
aught
but
a
beautiful
dream
no
dog
had
ever
put
paw
into
that
house
and
it
seemed
impossible
that
one
should
ever
do
so
as
for
those
beasts
of
prey
on
the
pavement
ay
said
james
boon
calmly
i
tell
him
you
here
said
constance
but
i
do
know
if
at
liberty
he
seldom
is
at
this
time
of
day
maggie
you
better
come
in
she
went
slowly
to
the
shop
full
of
fear
for
the
future
sam
she
whispered
to
her
husband
who
was
writing
at
his
desk
here
a
man
come
to
see
you
about
a
dog
assuredly
he
was
taken
aback
still
he
behaved
with
much
presence
of
mind
oh
about
a
dog
who
is
it
it
that
jim
boon
he
says
he
heard
you
want
one
the
renowned
name
of
jim
boon
gave
him
pause
but
he
had
to
go
through
with
the
affair
and
he
went
through
with
it
though
nervously
constance
followed
his
agitated
footsteps
to
the
morning
boon
morning
master
they
began
to
talk
dogs
povey
for
his
part
with
due
caution
now
there
a
dog
said
boon
pointing
to
one
of
the
a
miracle
of
splendid
ugliness
yes
responded
povey
insincerely
he
is
a
beauty
what
it
worth
now
at
a
venture
i
tak
a
hundred
and
twenty
sovereigns
for
her
said
boon
other
a
bit
cheaper

hundred

sam
gasped
constance
and
even
povey
nearly
lost
his
nerve
that
more
than
i
want
to
give
said
he
timidly
but
look
at
her
boon
persisted
roughly
snatching
up
the
more
expensive
animal
and
displaying
her
cannibal
teeth
povey
shook
his
head
constance
glanced
away
that
not
quite
the
sort
of
dog
i
want
said
povey
yes

more
like

eagerly

povey

him

my
yard

said
povey
and
bring
missis
along
too
now
what
about
a
cat
for
th
missis
or
a
the
end
of
the
episode
was
that
a
young
lady
aged
some
twelve
months
entered
the
povey
household
on
trial
her
exiguous
legs
twinkled
all
over
the
parlour
and
she
had
the
oddest
appearance
in
the
parlour
but
she
was
so
confiding
so
affectionate
so
timorous
and
her
black
nose
was
so
icy
in
that
hot
weather
that
constance
loved
her
violently
within
an
hour
povey
made
rules
for
her
he
explained
to
her
that
she
must
never
never
go
into
the
shop
but
she
went
and
he
whipped
her
to
the
squealing
point
and
constance
cried
an
instant
while
admiring
her
husband
firmness
the
dog
was
not
all
on
another
day
constance
prying
into
the
least
details
of
the
parlour
discovered
a
box
of
cigars
inside
the
lid
of
the
harmonium
on
the
keyboard
she
was
so
unaccustomed
to
cigars
that
at
first
she
did
not
realize
what
the
object
was
her
father
had
never
smoked
nor
drunk
intoxicants
nor
had
critchlow
nobody
had
ever
smoked
in
that
house
where
tobacco
had
always
been
regarded
as
equally
licentious
with
cards
devil
playthings
certainly
samuel
had
never
smoked
in
the
house
though
the
sight
of
the
reminded
constance
of
an
occasion
when
her
mother
had
announced
an
incredulous
suspicion
that
povey
fresh
from
an
excursion
into
the
world
on
a
thursday
evening
of
smoke
she
closed
the
harmonium
and
kept
silence
that
very
night
coming
suddenly
into
the
parlour
she
caught
samuel
at
the
harmonium
the
lid
went
down
with
a
resonant
bang
that
awoke
sympathetic
vibrations
in
every
corner
of
the
room
what
is
it
constance
inquired
jumping
oh
nothing
replied
povey
carelessly
each
was
deceiving
the
other
povey
hid
his
crime
and
constance
hid
her
knowledge
of
his
crime
false
false
but
this
is
what
marriage
is
and
the
next
day
constance
had
a
visit
in
the
shop
from
a
possible
new
servant
recommended
to
her
by
holl
the
grocer
will
you
please
step
this
way
said
constance
with
affable
primness
steeped
in
the
novel
sense
of
what
it
is
to
be
the
sole
responsible
mistress
of
a
vast
household
she
preceded
the
girl
to
the
parlour
and
as
they
passed
the
open
door
of
povey
room
constance
had
the
clear
vision
and
titillating
odour
of
her
husband
smoking
a
cigar
he
was
in
his
calmly
cutting
out
and
fan
the
lady
companion
at
watch
on
the
bench
yapped
at
the
possible
new
servant
i
think
i
shall
try
that
girl
said
she
to
samuel
at
tea
she
said
nothing
as
to
the
cigar
nor
did
he
on
the
following
evening
after
supper
povey
burst
out
i
think
i
have
a
weed
you
did
know
i
smoked
did
you
thus
povey
came
out
in
his
true
colours
as
a
blood
a
blade
and
a
gay
spark
but
dogs
and
cigars
disconcerting
enough
in
their
degree
were
to
the
signboard
when
the
signboard
at
last
came
as
skim
milk
is
to
hot
brandy
it
was
the
signboard
that
more
startlingly
than
anything
else
marked
the
dawn
of
a
new
era
in
luke
square
four
men
spent
a
day
and
a
half
in
fixing
it
they
had
ladders
ropes
and
pulleys
and
two
of
them
dined
on
the
flat
lead
roof
of
the
projecting
the
signboard
was
feet
long
and
two
feet
in
depth
over
its
centre
was
a
semicircle
about
three
feet
in
radius
this
semicircle
bore
the
legend
judiciously
disposed
povey
late
all
the
proper
was
devoted
to
the
words
john
baines
in
gold
letters
a
foot
and
a
half
high
on
a
green
ground
the
square
watched
and
wondered
and
murmured
well
bless
us
what
next
it
was
agreed
that
in
giving
paramount
importance
to
the
name
of
his
late
povey
had
displayed
a
very
nice
feeling
some
asked
with
glee
what
the
old
lady
have
to
say
constance
asked
herself
this
but
not
with
glee
when
constance
walked
down
the
square
homewards
she
could
scarcely
bear
to
look
at
the
sign
the
thought
of
what
her
mother
might
say
frightened
her
her
first
visit
of
state
was
imminent
and
aunt
harriet
was
to
accompany
her
constance
felt
almost
sick
as
the
day
approached
when
she
faintly
hinted
her
apprehensions
to
samuel
he
demanded
as
if
surprised
have
you
mentioned
it
in
one
of
your
letters
oh
no
if
that
all
said
he
with
bravado
i
write
and
tell
her
myself
iv
so
that
baines
was
duly
apprised
of
the
signboard
before
her
arrival
the
letter
written
by
her
to
constance
after
receiving
samuel
letter
which
was
merely
the
amiable
epistle
of
a
anxious
to
be
a
little
more
than
correct
contained
no
reference
to
the
signboard
this
silence
however
did
not
in
the
least
allay
constance
apprehensions
as
to
what
might
occur
when
her
mother
and
samuel
met
beneath
the
signboard
itself
it
was
therefore
with
a
fearful
as
well
as
an
eager
loving
heart
that
constance
opened
her
and
ran
down
the
steps
when
the
waggonette
stopped
in
king
street
on
the
thursday
morning
of
the
great
visit
of
the
sisters
but
a
surprise
awaited
her
aunt
harriet
had
not
come
baines
explained
as
she
soundly
kissed
her
daughter
that
at
the
last
moment
aunt
harriet
had
not
felt
well
enough
to
undertake
the
journey
she
sent
her
fondest
love
and
cake
her
pains
had
recurred
it
was
these
mysterious
pains
which
had
prevented
the
sisters
from
coming
to
bursley
earlier
the
word
cancer
the
continual
terror
of
stout
women
had
been
on
their
lips
without
having
been
actually
uttered
then
there
was
a
surcease
and
each
was
glad
that
she
had
refrained
from
the
dread
syllables
in
view
of
the
recurrence
it
was
not
unnatural
that
baines
vigorous
cheerfulness
should
be
somewhat
forced
what
is
it
do
you
think
constance
inquired
baines
pushed
her
lips
out
and
raised
her
eyebrows
a
gesture
which
meant
that
the
pains
might
mean
god
knew
what
i
hope
she
be
all
right
alone
observed
constance
of
course
said
baines
quickly
but
you
do
suppose
i
was
going
to
disappoint
you
do
you
she
added
looking
round
as
if
to
defy
the
fates
in
general
this
speech
and
its
tone
gave
intense
pleasure
to
constance
and
laden
with
parcels
they
mounted
the
stairs
together
very
content
with
each
other
very
happy
in
the
discovery
that
they
were
still
mother
and
daughter
very
intimate
in
an
inarticulate
way
constance
had
imagined
long
detailed
absorbing
and
highly
novel
conversations
between
herself
and
her
mother
upon
this
their
first
meeting
after
her
marriage
but
alone
in
the
bedroom
and
with
a
clear
to
dinner
they
neither
of
them
seemed
to
have
a
great
deal
to
impart
baines
slowly
removed
her
light
mantle
and
laid
it
with
precautions
on
the
white
damask
counterpane
then
fingering
her
weeds
she
glanced
about
the
chamber
nothing
was
changed
though
constance
had
previous
to
her
marriage
envisaged
certain
alterations
she
had
determined
to
postpone
them
feeling
that
one
revolutionist
in
a
house
was
enough
well
my
chuck
you
all
right
said
baines
with
hearty
and
direct
energy
gazing
straight
into
her
daughter
eyes
constance
perceived
that
the
question
was
universal
in
its
comprehensiveness
the
one
unique
expression
that
the
mother
would
give
to
her
maternal
concern
and
curiosity
and
that
it
condensed
into
six
words
as
much
interest
as
would
have
overflowed
into
a
whole
day
of
the
chatter
of
some
mothers
she
met
the
candid
glance
flushing
oh
yes
she
answered
with
ecstatic
fervour
perfectly
and
baines
nodded
as
if
dismissing
that
you
stouter
said
she
curtly
if
you
are
careful
you
be
as
big
as
any
of
us
oh
mother
the
interview
fell
to
a
lower
plane
of
emotion
it
even
fell
as
far
as
maggie
what
chiefly
preoccupied
constance
was
a
subtle
change
in
her
mother
she
found
her
mother
fussy
in
trifles
her
manner
of
laying
down
her
mantle
of
smoothing
out
her
gloves
and
her
anxiety
that
her
bonnet
should
not
come
to
harm
were
rather
trying
were
perhaps
in
the
very
slightest
degree
pitiable
it
was
nothing
it
was
barely
perceptible
and
yet
it
was
enough
to
alter
constance
mental
attitude
to
her
mother
poor
dear
thought
constance
i
afraid
she
not
what
she
was
incredible
that
her
mother
could
have
aged
in
less
than
six
weeks
constance
did
not
allow
for
the
chemistry
that
had
been
going
on
in
herself
the
encounter
between
baines
and
her
was
of
the
most
satisfactory
nature
he
was
waiting
in
the
parlour
for
her
to
descend
he
made
himself
exceedingly
agreeable
kissing
her
and
flattering
her
by
his
evidently
sincere
desire
to
please
he
explained
that
he
had
kept
an
eye
open
for
the
waggonette
but
had
been
called
away
his
dear
me
on
learning
about
aunt
harriet
lacked
nothing
in
conviction
though
both
women
knew
that
his
affection
for
aunt
harriet
would
never
get
the
better
of
his
reason
to
constance
her
husband
behaviour
was
marvellously
perfect
she
had
not
suspected
him
to
be
such
a
man
of
the
world
and
her
eyes
said
to
her
mother
quite
unconsciously
you
see
after
all
you
did
rate
sam
as
high
as
you
ought
to
have
done
now
you
see
your
mistake
as
they
sat
waiting
for
dinner
constance
and
baines
on
the
sofa
and
samuel
on
the
edge
of
the
nearest
a
small
scuffling
noise
was
heard
outside
the
door
which
gave
on
the
kitchen
steps
the
door
yielded
to
pressure
and
fan
rushed
importantly
in
deranging
mats
fan
nose
had
been
hinting
to
her
that
she
was
behind
the
times
not
in
the
affairs
of
the
household
and
she
had
hurried
from
the
kitchen
to
make
inquiries
it
occurred
to
her
en
route
that
she
had
been
washed
that
morning
the
spectacle
of
baines
stopped
her
she
stood
with
her
legs
slightly
her
nose
lifted
her
ears
raking
forward
her
bright
eyes
blinking
and
her
tail
undecided
i
was
sure
i
never
smelt
anything
like
that
before
she
was
saying
to
herself
as
she
stared
at
baines
and
baines
staring
at
fan
had
a
similar
though
not
the
same
sentiment
the
silence
was
terrible
constance
took
on
the
mien
of
a
culprit
and
sam
had
obviously
lost
his
easy
bearing
of
a
man
of
the
world
baines
was
merely
thunderstruck
a
dog
suddenly
fan
tail
began
to
wag
more
quickly
and
then
having
looked
in
vain
for
encouragement
to
her
master
and
mistress
she
gave
one
mighty
spring
and
alighted
in
baines
lap
it
was
an
aim
she
could
not
have
missed
constance
emitted
an
oh
fan
of
shocked
terror
and
samuel
betrayed
his
nervous
tension
by
an
involuntary
movement
but
fan
had
settled
down
into
that
titanic
lap
as
into
heaven
it
was
a
greater
flattery
than
povey
so
your
name
fan
murmured
baines
stroking
the
animal
you
are
a
dear
yes
is
she
said
constance
with
inconceivable
rapidity
the
danger
was
past
thus
without
any
explanation
fan
became
an
accepted
fact
the
next
moment
maggie
served
the
yorkshire
pudding
well
maggie
said
baines
so
you
are
going
to
get
married
this
time
when
is
it
sunday
and
you
leave
here
on
saturday
yes
well
i
must
have
a
talk
with
you
before
i
go
during
the
dinner
not
a
word
as
to
the
signboard
several
times
the
conversation
curved
towards
that
signboard
in
the
most
alarming
fashion
but
invariably
it
curved
away
again
like
a
train
from
another
train
when
two
trains
are
simultaneously
leaving
a
station
constance
had
frights
so
serious
as
to
destroy
her
anxiety
about
the
cookery
in
the
end
she
comprehended
that
her
mother
had
adopted
a
silently
disapproving
attitude
fan
was
socially
very
useful
throughout
the
repast
after
dinner
constance
was
on
pins
lest
samuel
should
light
a
cigar
she
had
not
requested
him
not
to
do
so
for
though
she
was
entirely
sure
of
his
affection
she
had
already
learned
that
a
husband
is
possessed
by
a
demon
of
contrariety
which
often
forces
him
to
violate
his
higher
feelings
however
samuel
did
not
light
a
cigar
he
went
off
to
superintend
the
of
the
shop
while
baines
chatted
with
maggie
and
gave
her
for
a
wedding
present
then
critchlow
called
to
offer
his
salutations
a
little
before
tea
baines
announced
that
she
would
go
out
for
a
short
walk
by
herself
where
has
she
gone
to
smiled
samuel
superiorly
as
with
constance
at
the
window
he
watched
her
turn
down
king
street
towards
the
church
i
expect
she
has
gone
to
look
at
father
grave
said
constance
oh
muttered
samuel
apologetically
constance
was
mistaken
before
reaching
the
church
baines
deviated
to
the
right
got
into
brougham
street
and
thence
by
acre
lane
into
oldcastle
street
whose
steep
she
climbed
now
oldcastle
street
ends
at
the
top
of
luke
square
and
from
the
corner
baines
had
an
excellent
view
of
the
signboard
it
being
thursday
afternoon
scarce
a
soul
was
about
she
returned
to
her
daughter
by
the
same
extraordinary
route
and
said
not
a
word
on
entering
but
she
was
markedly
cheerful
the
waggonette
came
after
tea
and
baines
made
her
final
preparations
to
depart
the
visit
had
proved
a
wonderful
success
it
would
have
been
utterly
perfect
if
samuel
had
not
marred
it
at
the
very
door
of
the
waggonette
somehow
he
contrived
to
be
talking
of
christmas
only
a
person
of
samuel
native
clumsiness
would
have
mentioned
christmas
in
july
you
know
you
spend
christmas
with
us
said
he
into
the
waggonette
indeed
i
sha
replied
baines
aunt
harriet
and
i
will
expect
you
at
axe
we
already
settled
that
povey
bridled
oh
no
he
protested
hurt
by
this
summariness
having
had
no
relatives
except
his
cousin
the
confectioner
for
many
years
he
had
dreamt
of
at
last
establishing
a
family
christmas
under
his
own
roof
and
the
dream
was
dear
to
him
baines
said
nothing
we
could
possibly
leave
the
shop
said
povey
nonsense
baines
retorted
putting
her
lips
together
christmas
day
is
on
a
monday
the
waggonette
in
starting
jerked
her
head
towards
the
door
and
set
all
her
curls
shaking
no
white
in
those
curls
yet
scarcely
a
touch
of
grey
i
shall
take
good
care
we
do
go
there
anyway
povey
mumbled
in
his
heat
half
to
himself
and
half
to
constance
he
had
stained
the
brightness
of
the
day
chapter
ii
christmas
and
the
future
i
povey
was
playing
a
hymn
tune
on
the
harmonium
it
having
been
decided
that
no
one
should
go
to
chapel
constance
in
mourning
with
a
white
apron
over
her
dress
sat
on
a
hassock
in
front
of
the
fire
and
near
her
in
a
baines
swayed
very
gently
to
and
fro
the
weather
was
extremely
cold
povey
mittened
hands
were
blue
and
red
but
like
many
shopkeepers
he
had
apparently
grown
almost
insensible
to
vagaries
of
temperature
although
the
fire
was
immense
and
furious
its
influence
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
mediaeval
grate
was
designed
to
heat
the
flue
rather
than
the
room
seemed
to
die
away
at
the
borders
of
the
fender
constance
could
not
have
been
much
closer
to
it
without
being
a
salamander
the
era
of
good
christmases
so
agreeably
picturesque
for
the
poor
was
not
yet
at
an
end
yes
samuel
povey
had
won
the
battle
concerning
the
locus
of
the
family
christmas
but
he
had
received
the
help
of
a
formidable
ally
death
harriet
maddack
had
passed
away
after
an
operation
leaving
her
house
and
her
money
to
her
sister
the
solemn
rite
of
her
interment
had
deeply
affected
all
the
respectability
of
the
town
of
axe
where
the
late
maddack
had
been
a
figure
of
consequence
it
had
even
shut
up
the
shop
in
luke
square
for
a
whole
day
it
was
such
a
funeral
as
aunt
harriet
herself
would
have
approved
a
tremendous
ceremonial
which
left
on
the
crushed
mind
an
ineffaceable
intricate
impression
of
shiny
cloth
crape
horses
with
arching
necks
and
long
manes
the
drawl
of
parsons
cake
port
sighs
and
christian
submission
to
the
inscrutable
decrees
of
providence
baines
had
borne
herself
with
unnatural
calmness
until
the
funeral
was
over
and
then
constance
perceived
that
the
remembered
mother
of
her
girlhood
existed
no
longer
for
the
majority
of
human
souls
it
would
have
been
easier
to
love
a
virtuous
principle
or
a
mountain
than
to
love
aunt
harriet
who
was
assuredly
less
a
woman
than
an
institution
but
baines
had
loved
her
and
she
had
been
the
one
person
to
whom
baines
looked
for
support
and
guidance
when
she
died
baines
paid
the
tribute
of
respect
with
the
last
hoarded
remains
of
her
proud
fortitude
and
weepingly
confessed
that
the
unconquerable
had
been
conquered
the
inexhaustible
exhausted
and
became
old
with
whitening
hair
she
had
persisted
in
her
refusal
to
spend
christmas
in
bursley
but
both
constance
and
samuel
knew
that
the
resistance
was
only
formal
she
soon
yielded
when
constance
second
new
servant
took
it
into
her
head
to
leave
a
week
before
christmas
baines
might
have
pointed
out
the
finger
of
providence
at
work
again
and
this
time
in
her
favour
but
no
with
amazing
pliancy
she
suggested
that
she
should
bring
one
of
her
own
servants
to
constance
over
christmas
she
was
met
with
all
the
forms
of
loving
solicitude
and
she
found
that
her
daughter
and
had
out
of
the
state
bedroom
in
her
favour
intensely
flattered
by
this
attention
which
was
magnanimous
idea
she
nevertheless
protested
strongly
indeed
she
not
hear
of
it
now
mother
do
be
silly
constance
had
said
firmly
you
expect
us
to
be
at
all
the
trouble
of
moving
back
again
do
you
and
baines
had
surrendered
in
tears
thus
had
come
christmas
perhaps
it
was
fortunate
that
the
axe
servant
being
not
quite
the
ordinary
servant
but
a
benefactor
where
a
benefactor
was
needed
both
constance
and
her
mother
thought
it
well
to
occupy
themselves
in
household
work
the
benefactor
as
much
as
possible
hence
constance
white
apron
there
he
is
said
povey
still
playing
but
with
his
eye
on
the
street
constance
sprang
up
eagerly
then
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
constance
opened
and
an
icy
blast
swept
into
the
room
the
postman
stood
on
the
steps
his
instrument
for
knocking
like
a
drumstick
in
one
hand
a
large
bundle
of
letters
in
the
other
and
a
yawning
bag
across
the
pit
of
his
stomach
merry
christmas
cried
the
postman
trying
to
keep
warm
by
cheerfulness
constance
taking
the
letters
responded
while
povey
playing
the
harmonium
with
his
right
hand
drew
half
a
crown
from
his
pocket
with
the
left
here
you
are
he
said
giving
it
to
constance
who
gave
it
to
the
postman
fan
who
had
been
keeping
her
muzzle
warm
with
the
extremity
of
her
tail
on
the
sofa
jumped
down
to
superintend
the
transaction
brrr
vibrated
povey
as
constance
shut
the
door
what
lots
constance
exclaimed
rushing
to
the
fire
here
mother
here
sam
the
girl
had
resumed
possession
of
the
woman
body
though
the
baines
family
had
few
friends
sustained
hospitality
being
little
practised
in
those
days
they
had
of
course
many
acquaintances
and
like
other
families
they
counted
their
christmas
cards
as
an
indian
counts
scalps
the
tale
was
satisfactory
there
were
between
thirty
and
forty
envelopes
constance
extracted
christmas
cards
rapidly
reading
their
contents
aloud
and
then
propping
them
up
on
the
mantelpiece
baines
assisted
fan
dealt
with
the
envelopes
on
the
floor
povey
to
prove
that
his
soul
was
above
toys
and
gewgaws
continued
to
play
the
harmonium
oh
mother
constance
murmured
in
a
startled
hesitant
voice
holding
an
envelope
what
is
it
my
chuck
it
the
envelope
was
addressed
to
and
miss
baines
in
large
perpendicular
dashing
characters
which
constance
instantly
recognised
as
sophia
the
stamps
were
strange
the
postmark
baines
leaned
forward
and
looked
open
it
child
she
said
the
envelope
contained
an
english
christmas
card
of
a
common
type
a
spray
of
holly
with
greetings
and
on
it
was
written
i
do
hope
this
will
reach
you
on
christmas
morning
fondest
love
no
signature
nor
address
baines
took
it
with
a
trembling
hand
and
adjusted
her
spectacles
she
gazed
at
it
a
long
time
and
it
has
done
she
said
and
wept
she
tried
to
speak
again
but
not
being
able
to
command
herself
held
forth
the
card
to
constance
and
jerked
her
head
in
the
direction
of
povey
constance
rose
and
put
the
card
on
the
keyboard
of
the
harmonium
sophia
she
whispered
povey
stopped
playing
dear
dear
he
muttered
fan
perceiving
that
nobody
was
interested
in
her
feats
suddenly
stood
still
baines
tried
once
more
to
speak
but
could
not
then
her
ringlets
shaking
beneath
the
band
of
her
weeds
she
found
her
feet
stepped
to
the
harmonium
and
with
a
movement
almost
convulsive
snatched
the
card
from
povey
and
returned
to
her
chair
povey
abruptly
left
the
room
followed
by
fan
both
the
women
were
in
tears
and
he
was
tremendously
surprised
to
discover
a
dangerous
lump
in
his
own
throat
the
beautiful
and
imperious
vision
of
sophia
sophia
as
she
had
left
them
innocent
wayward
had
swiftly
risen
up
before
him
and
made
even
him
a
woman
too
yet
he
had
never
liked
sophia
the
awful
secret
wound
in
the
family
pride
revealed
itself
to
him
as
never
before
and
he
felt
intensely
the
mother
tragedy
which
she
carried
in
her
breast
as
aunt
harriet
had
carried
a
cancer
at
dinner
he
said
suddenly
to
baines
who
still
wept
now
mother
you
must
cheer
up
you
know
yes
i
must
she
said
quickly
and
she
did
do
neither
samuel
nor
constance
saw
the
card
again
little
was
said
there
was
nothing
to
say
as
sophia
had
given
no
address
she
must
be
still
ashamed
of
her
situation
but
she
had
thought
of
her
mother
and
sister
she
she
did
not
even
know
that
constance
was
married
what
sort
of
a
place
was
paris
to
bursley
paris
was
nothing
but
the
site
of
a
great
exhibition
which
had
recently
closed
through
the
influence
of
baines
a
new
servant
was
found
for
constance
in
a
village
near
axe
a
raw
comely
girl
who
had
never
been
in
a
and
through
the
post
it
was
arranged
that
this
innocent
should
come
to
the
cave
on
the
of
december
in
obedience
to
the
safe
rule
that
servants
should
never
be
allowed
to
meet
for
the
interchange
of
opinions
baines
decided
to
leave
with
her
own
servant
on
the
thirtieth
she
would
not
be
persuaded
to
spend
the
new
year
in
the
square
on
the
poor
aunt
maria
died
all
of
a
sudden
in
her
cottage
in
brougham
street
everybody
was
duly
distressed
and
in
particular
baines
demeanour
under
this
affliction
showed
the
perfection
of
correctness
but
she
caused
it
to
be
understood
that
she
should
not
remain
for
the
funeral
her
nerves
would
be
unequal
to
the
ordeal
and
moreover
her
servant
must
not
stay
to
corrupt
the
new
girl
nor
could
baines
think
of
sending
her
servant
to
axe
in
advance
to
spend
several
days
in
idle
gossip
with
her
colleague
this
decision
took
the
backbone
out
of
aunt
maria
funeral
which
touched
the
extreme
of
modesty
a
hearse
and
a
coach
povey
was
glad
because
he
happened
to
be
very
busy
an
hour
before
his
departure
he
came
into
the
parlour
with
the
proof
of
a
poster
what
is
that
samuel
asked
baines
not
dreaming
of
the
blow
that
awaited
her
it
for
my
first
annual
sale
replied
povey
with
false
tranquillity
baines
merely
tossed
her
head
constance
happily
for
constance
was
not
present
at
this
final
defeat
of
the
old
order
had
she
been
there
she
would
certainly
not
have
known
where
to
look
ii
forty
next
birthday
povey
exclaimed
one
day
with
an
expression
and
in
a
tone
that
were
at
once
and
serious
this
was
on
his
birthday
constance
was
startled
she
had
of
course
been
aware
that
they
were
getting
older
but
she
had
never
realized
the
phenomenon
though
customers
occasionally
remarked
that
povey
was
stouter
and
though
when
she
helped
him
to
measure
himself
for
a
new
suit
of
clothes
the
tape
proved
the
fact
he
had
not
changed
for
her
she
knew
that
she
too
had
become
somewhat
stouter
but
for
herself
she
remained
exactly
the
same
constance
only
by
recalling
dates
and
by
calculations
could
she
really
grasp
that
she
had
been
married
a
little
over
six
years
and
not
a
little
over
six
months
she
had
to
admit
that
if
samuel
would
be
forty
next
birthday
she
would
be
next
birthday
but
it
would
not
be
a
real
nor
would
sam
forty
be
a
real
forty
like
other
people
and
forties
not
long
since
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
regarding
a
man
of
forty
as
senile
as
practically
in
his
grave
she
reflected
and
the
more
she
reflected
the
more
clearly
she
saw
that
after
all
the
almanacs
had
not
lied
look
at
fan
yes
it
must
be
five
years
since
the
memorable
morning
when
doubt
first
crossed
the
minds
of
samuel
and
constance
as
to
fan
moral
principles
samuel
enthusiasm
for
dogs
was
equalled
by
his
ignorance
of
the
dangers
to
which
a
young
female
of
temperament
may
be
exposed
and
he
was
much
disturbed
as
doubt
developed
into
certainty
fan
indeed
was
the
one
being
who
did
not
suffer
from
shock
and
who
had
no
fears
as
to
the
results
the
animal
having
a
pure
mind
was
bereft
of
modesty
sundry
enormities
had
she
committed
but
none
to
rank
with
this
one
the
result
was
four
quadrupeds
recognizable
as
povey
breathed
again
fan
had
had
more
luck
than
she
deserved
for
the
result
might
have
been
simply
anything
her
owners
forgave
her
and
disposed
of
these
fruits
of
iniquity
and
then
married
her
lawfully
to
a
husband
who
was
so
high
up
in
the
world
that
he
could
demand
a
dowry
and
now
fan
was
a
grandmother
with
fixed
ideas
and
habits
and
a
son
in
the
house
and
various
grandchildren
scattered
over
the
town
fan
was
a
sedate
and
disillusioned
dog
she
knew
the
world
as
it
was
and
in
learning
it
she
had
taught
her
owners
above
a
bit
then
there
was
maggie
hollins
constance
could
still
vividly
recall
the
with
which
she
had
one
day
received
maggie
and
the
heir
of
the
hollinses
but
it
was
a
long
time
ago
after
staggering
half
the
town
by
the
production
of
this
infant
of
which
she
nearly
died
maggie
allowed
the
angels
to
waft
it
away
to
heaven
and
everybody
said
that
she
ought
to
be
very
thankful
at
her
age
old
women
dug
up
out
of
their
minds
forgotten
histories
of
the
eccentricities
of
the
goddess
lucina
baines
was
most
curiously
interested
she
talked
freely
to
constance
and
constance
began
to
see
what
an
incredible
town
bursley
had
always
been
and
she
never
suspected
it
maggie
was
now
mother
of
other
children
and
the
draggled
lame
mistress
of
a
drunken
home
and
looked
sixty
despite
her
prophecy
her
husband
had
conserved
his
the
poveys
ate
all
the
fish
they
could
and
sometimes
more
than
they
enjoyed
because
on
his
sober
days
hollins
invariably
started
his
round
at
the
shop
and
constance
had
to
buy
for
maggie
sake
the
worst
of
the
worthless
husband
was
that
he
seldom
failed
to
be
cheery
and
polite
he
never
missed
asking
after
the
health
of
baines
and
when
constance
replied
that
her
mother
was
well
considering
but
that
she
would
not
come
over
to
bursley
again
until
the
axe
railway
was
opened
as
she
could
not
stand
the
drive
he
would
shake
his
grey
head
and
be
sympathetically
gloomy
for
an
instant
all
these
changes
in
six
years
the
almanacs
were
in
the
right
of
it
but
nothing
had
happened
to
her
gradually
she
had
obtained
a
sure
ascendency
over
her
mother
yet
without
seeking
it
merely
as
the
outcome
of
time
influences
on
her
and
on
her
mother
respectively
gradually
she
had
gained
skill
and
use
in
the
management
of
her
household
and
of
her
share
of
the
shop
so
that
these
machines
ran
smoothly
and
effectively
and
a
sudden
contretemps
no
longer
frightened
her
gradually
she
had
constructed
a
chart
of
samuel
individuality
with
the
submerged
rocks
and
perilous
currents
all
carefully
marked
so
that
she
could
now
voyage
unalarmed
in
those
seas
but
nothing
happened
unless
their
visits
to
buxton
could
be
called
happenings
decidedly
the
visit
to
buxton
was
the
one
little
hill
that
rose
out
of
the
level
plain
of
the
year
they
had
formed
the
annual
habit
of
going
to
buxton
for
ten
days
they
had
a
way
of
saying
yes
we
always
go
to
buxton
we
went
there
for
our
honeymoon
you
know
they
had
become
confirmed
buxtonites
with
views
concerning
anne
terrace
the
broad
walk
and
peel
cavern
they
could
not
dream
of
deserting
their
buxton
it
was
the
sole
possible
resort
was
it
not
the
highest
town
in
england
well
then
they
always
stayed
at
the
same
lodgings
and
grew
to
be
special
favourites
of
the
landlady
who
whispered
of
them
to
all
her
other
guests
as
having
come
to
her
house
for
their
honeymoon
and
as
never
missing
a
year
and
as
being
most
respectable
superior
people
in
quite
a
large
way
of
business
each
year
they
walked
out
of
buxton
station
behind
their
luggage
on
a
truck
full
of
joy
and
pride
because
they
knew
all
the
landmarks
and
the
lie
of
all
the
streets
and
which
were
the
best
shops
at
the
beginning
the
notion
of
leaving
the
shop
to
hired
custody
had
seemed
almost
fantastic
and
the
preparations
for
absence
had
been
very
complicated
then
it
was
that
miss
insull
had
detached
herself
from
the
other
young
lady
assistants
as
a
creature
who
could
be
absolutely
trusted
miss
insull
was
older
than
constance
she
had
a
bad
complexion
and
she
was
not
clever
but
she
was
one
of
your
reliable
ones
the
six
years
had
witnessed
the
slow
steady
rise
of
miss
insull
her
employers
said
insull
in
a
tone
quite
different
from
that
in
which
they
said
hawkins
or
dadd
insull
meant
the
end
of
a
discussion
tell
miss
insull
insull
will
see
to
that
shall

slept
in

house
ten
nights
every
year
miss
insull
had
been
called
into
consultation
when
it
was
decided
to
engage
a
fourth
hand
in
the
shape
of
an
apprentice
trade
had
improved
into
positive
excellence
it
was
now
admitted
to
be
good
a
rare
honour
for
trade
the
boom
was
at
its
height
and
colliers
in
addition
to
getting
drunk
were
buying
american
organs
and
expensive
often
they
would
come
to
the
shop
to
purchase
cloth
for
coats
for
their
dogs
and
they
would
have
good
cloth
povey
did
not
like
this
one
day
a
butty
chose
for
his
dog
the
best
cloth
of
povey
shop
at
a
yard
will
ye
make
it
up
i
gotten
th
measurements
asked

collier
no
i

said
povey
hotly
and
what
more
i
wo

the
cloth
either
cloth
at
a
yard
on
a
dog
back
indeed
i
thank
you
to
get
out
of
my
shop
the
incident
became
historic
in
the
square
it
finally
established
that
povey
was
a
worthy
and
a
solid
and
successful
man
it
vindicated
the
old
of
baines
some
surprise
was
expressed
that
povey
showed
no
desire
nor
tendency
towards
entering
the
public
life
of
the
town
but
he
never
would
though
a
keen
satirical
critic
of
the
local
board
in
private
and
at
the
chapel
he
remained
a
simple
private
worshipper
refusing
stewardships
and
trusteeships
iii
was
constance
happy
of
course
there
was
always
something
on
her
mind
something
that
had
to
be
dealt
with
either
in
the
shop
or
in
the
house
something
to
employ
all
the
skill
and
experience
which
she
had
acquired
her
life
had
much
in
it
of
laborious
tedium
tedium
and
monotonous
and
both
she
and
samuel
worked
consistently
hard
rising
early
forward
as
the
phrase
ran
and
going
to
bed
early
from
sheer
fatigue
week
after
week
and
month
after
month
as
season
changed
imperceptibly
into
season
in
june
and
july
it
would
happen
to
them
occasionally
to
retire
before
the
last
silver
of
dusk
was
out
of
the
sky
they
would
lie
in
bed
and
talk
placidly
of
their
daily
affairs
there
would
be
a
noise
in
the
street
below
vaults
closing
samuel
would
say
and
yawn
yes
it
quite
late
constance
would
say
and
the
swiss
clock
would
rapidly
strike
eleven
on
its
coil
of
resonant
wire
and
then
just
before
she
went
to
sleep
constance
might
reflect
upon
her
destiny
as
even
the
busiest
and
smoothest
women
do
and
she
would
decide
that
it
was
kind
her
mother
gradual
decline
and
lonely
life
at
axe
saddened
her
the
cards
which
came
now
and
then
at
extremely
long
intervals
from
sophia
had
been
the
cause
of
more
sorrow
than
joy
the
naive
ecstasies
of
her
girlhood
had
long
since
departed
the
price
paid
for
experience
and
and
a
true
vision
of
things
the
vast
inherent
melancholy
of
the
universe
did
not
exempt
her
but
as
she
went
to
sleep
she
would
be
conscious
of
a
vague
contentment
the
basis
of
this
contentment
was
the
fact
that
she
and
samuel
comprehended
and
esteemed
each
other
and
made
allowances
for
each
other
their
characters
had
been
tested
and
had
stood
the
test
affection
love
was
not
to
them
a
salient
phenomenon
in
their
relations
habit
had
inevitably
dulled
its
glitter
it
was
like
a
flavouring
scarce
remarked
but
had
it
been
absent
how
they
would
have
turned
from
that
dish
samuel
never
or
hardly
ever
set
himself
to
meditate
upon
the
problem
whether
or
not
life
had
come
up
to
his
expectations
but
he
had
at
times
strange
sensations
which
he
did
not
analyze
and
which
approached
nearer
to
ecstasy
than
any
feeling
of
constance
thus
when
he
was
in
one
of
his
dark
furies
molten
within
and
black
without
the
sudden
thought
of
his
wife
unalterable
benignant
calm
which
nothing
could
overthrow
might
strike
him
into
a
wondering
cold
for
him
she
was
astoundingly
feminine
she
would
put
flowers
on
the
mantelpiece
and
then
hours
afterwards
in
the
middle
of
a
meal
ask
him
unexpectedly
what
he
thought
of
her
and
he
gradually
divined
that
a
perfunctory
reply
left
her
unsatisfied
she
wanted
a
genuine
opinion
a
genuine
opinion
mattered
to
her
fancy
calling
flowers
on
a
mantelpiece
a
how
charming
how
childlike
then
she
had
a
way
on
sunday
mornings
when
she
descended
to
the
parlour
all
ready
for
chapel
of
shutting
the
door
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
with
a
little
bang
shaking
herself
and
turning
round
swiftly
as
if
for
his
inspection
as
if
saying
well
what
about
this
will
this
do
a
phenomenon
always
associated
in
his
mind
with
the
smell
of
kid
gloves
invariably
she
asked
him
about
the
colours
and
cut
of
her
dresses
would
he
prefer
this
or
that
he
could
not
take
such
questions
seriously
until
one
day
he
happened
to
hint
merely
hint
that
he
was
not
a
admirer
of
a
certain
new
dress
it
was
her
first
new
dress
after
the
definite
abandonment
of
crinolines
she
never
wore
it
again
he
thought
she
was
not
serious
at
first
and
remonstrated
against
a
joke
being
carried
too
far
she
said
it
not
a
bit
of
use
you
talking
i
sha
wear
it
again
and
then
he
so
far
appreciated
her
seriousness
as
to
refrain
by
discretion
from
any
comment
the
incident
affected
him
for
days
it
flattered
him
it
thrilled
him
but
it
baffled
him
strange
that
a
woman
subject
to
such
caprices
should
be
so
sagacious
capable
and
utterly
reliable
as
constance
was
for
the
practical
and
commonsense
side
of
her
eternally
compelled
his
admiration
the
very
first
example
of
it
her
insistence
that
the
simultaneous
absence
of
both
of
them
from
the
shop
for
half
an
hour
or
an
hour
twice
a
day
would
not
mean
the
immediate
downfall
of
the
business
had
remained
in
his
mind
ever
since
had
she
not
been
obstinate
in
her
benevolent
way
against
the
old
superstition
which
he
had
acquired
from
his
employers
they
might
have
been
eating
separately
to
that
day
then
her
handling
of
her
mother
during
the
months
of
the
siege
of
paris
when
baines
was
convinced
that
her
sinful
daughter
was
in
hourly
danger
of
death
had
been
extraordinarily
fine
he
considered
and
the
sequel
a
card
for
constance
birthday
had
completely
justified
her
attitude
sometimes
some
blundering
fool
would
jovially
exclaim
to
them
what
about
that
baby
or
a
woman
would
remark
quietly
i
often
feel
sorry
you
no
children
and
they
would
answer
that
really
they
did
not
know
what
they
would
do
if
there
was
a
baby
what
with
the
shop
and
one
thing
or
another
and
they
were
quite
sincere
iv
it
is
remarkable
what
a
little
thing
will
draw
even
the
most
regular
and
serious
people
from
the
deep
groove
of
their
habits
one
morning
in
march
a
boneshaker
an
affair
on
two
equal
wooden
wheels
joined
by
a
bar
of
iron
in
the
middle
of
which
was
a
wooden
saddle
disturbed
the
gravity
of
luke
square
true
it
was
probably
the
first
boneshaker
that
had
ever
attacked
the
gravity
of
luke
square
it
came
out
of
the
shop
of
daniel
povey
the
confectioner
and
baker
and
samuel
povey
celebrated
cousin
in
boulton
terrace
boulton
terrace
formed
nearly
a
right
angle
with
the
baines
premises
and
at
the
corner
of
the
angle
wedgwood
street
and
king
street
left
the
square
the
boneshaker
was
brought
forth
by
dick
povey
the
only
son
of
daniel
now
aged
eleven
years
under
the
superintendence
of
his
father
and
the
square
soon
perceived
that
dick
had
a
natural
talent
for
an
untrained
boneshaker
after
a
few
attempts
he
could
remain
on
the
back
of
the
machine
for
at
least
ten
yards
and
his
feats
had
the
effect
of
endowing
luke
square
with
the
attractiveness
of
a
circus
samuel
povey
watched
with
candid
interest
from
the
ambush
of
his
door
while
the
unfortunate
young
lady
assistants
though
aware
of
the
performance
that
was
going
on
dared
not
stir
from
the
stove
samuel
was
tremendously
tempted
to
sally
out
boldly
and
chat
with
his
cousin
about
the
toy
he
had
surely
a
better
right
to
do
so
than
any
other
tradesman
in
the
square
since
he
was
of
the
family
but
his
diffidence
prevented
him
from
moving
presently
daniel
povey
and
dick
went
to
the
top
of
the
square
with
the
machine
opposite
holl
and
dick
being
carefully
installed
in
the
saddle
essayed
to
descend
the
gentle
paven
slopes
of
the
square
he
failed
time
after
time
the
machine
had
an
astonishing
way
of
turning
round
running
uphill
and
then
lying
calmly
on
its
side
at
this
point
of
dick
every
in
the
square
was
occupied
by
an
audience
at
last
the
boneshaker
displayed
less
unwillingness
to
obey
and
lo
in
a
moment
dick
was
riding
down
the
square
and
the
spectators
held
their
breath
as
if
he
had
been
blondin
crossing
niagara
every
second
he
ought
to
have
fallen
off
but
he
contrived
to
keep
upright
already
he
had
accomplished
twenty
yards
thirty
yards
it
was
a
miracle
that
he
was
performing
the
transit
continued
and
seemed
to
occupy
hours
and
then
a
faint
hope
rose
in
the
breast
of
the
watchers
that
the
prodigy
might
arrive
at
the
bottom
of
the
square
his
speed
was
increasing
with
his
but
the
square
was
enormous
boundless
samuel
povey
gazed
at
the
approaching
phenomenon
as
a
bird
at
a
serpent
with
bulging
beady
eyes
the
child
speed
went
on
increasing
and
his
path
grew
straighter
yes
he
would
arrive
he
would
do
it
samuel
povey
involuntarily
lifted
one
leg
in
his
nervous
tension
and
now
the
hope
that
dick
would
arrive
became
a
fear
as
his
pace
grew
still
more
rapid
everybody
lifted
one
leg
and
gaped
and
the
intrepid
child
surged
on
and
finally
victorious
crashed
into
the
pavement
in
front
of
samuel
at
the
rate
of
quite
six
miles
an
hour
samuel
picked
him
up
unscathed
and
somehow
this
picking
up
of
dick
invested
samuel
with
importance
gave
him
a
share
in
the
glory
of
the
feat
itself
daniel
povey
same
running
and
joyous
not
so
bad
for
a
start
eh
exclaimed
the
great
daniel
though
by
no
means
a
simple
man
his
pride
in
his
offspring
sometimes
made
him
a
little
naive
father
and
son
explained
the
machine
to
samuel
dick
incessantly
repeating
the
exceedingly
strange
truth
that
if
you
felt
you
were
falling
to
your
right
you
must
turn
to
your
right
and
vice
versa
samuel
found
himself
suddenly
admitted
as
it
were
to
the
inner
fellowship
of
the
boneshaker
exalted
above
the
rest
of
the
square
in
another
adventure
more
thrilling
events
occurred
the
dick
was
one
of
those
dangerous
frenzied
madcaps
who
are
born
without
fear
the
secret
of
the
machine
had
been
revealed
to
him
in
his
recent
transit
and
he
was
silently
determining
to
surpass
himself
precariously
balanced
he
descended
the
square
again
frowning
hard
his
teeth
set
and
actually
managed
to
swerve
into
king
street
constance
in
the
parlour
saw
an
incomprehensible
winged
thing
fly
past
the
window
the
cousins
povey
sounded
an
alarm
and
protest
and
ran
in
pursuit
for
the
gradient
of
king
street
is
in
the
strict
sense
steep
down
king
street
dick
was
travelling
at
twenty
miles
an
hour
and
heading
straight
for
the
church
as
though
he
meant
to
disestablish
it
and
perish
the
main
gate
of
the
churchyard
was
open
and
that
affrighting
child
with
a
lunatic
luck
whizzed
safely
through
the
portals
into
god
acre
the
cousins
povey
discovered
him
lying
on
a
green
grave
clothed
in
pride
his
first
words
were
dad
did
you
pick
my
cap
up
the
symbolism
of
the
amazing
ride
did
not
escape
the
square
indeed
it
was
much
discussed
this
incident
led
to
a
friendship
between
the
cousins
they
formed
a
habit
of
meeting
in
the
square
for
a
chat
the
meetings
were
the
subject
of
comment
for
samuel
relations
with
the
greater
daniel
had
always
been
of
the
most
distant
it
was
understood
that
samuel
disapproved
of
daniel
povey
even
more
than
the
majority
of
people
disapproved
of
her
daniel
povey
however
was
away
from
home
probably
had
she
not
been
samuel
would
not
even
have
gone
to
the
length
of
joining
daniel
on
the
neutral
ground
of
the
open
square
but
having
once
broken
the
ice
samuel
was
glad
to
be
on
terms
of
growing
intimacy
with
his
cousin
the
friendship
flattered
him
for
daniel
despite
his
wife
was
a
figure
in
a
world
larger
than
samuel
moreover
it
consecrated
his
position
as
the
equal
of
no
matter
what
tradesman
apprentice
though
he
had
been
and
also
he
genuinely
liked
and
admired
daniel
rather
to
his
own
astonishment
every
one
liked
daniel
povey
he
was
a
favourite
among
all
ranks
the
leading
confectioner
a
member
of
the
local
board
and
a
sidesman
at
luke
he
was
and
had
been
for
years
very
prominent
in
the
town
he
was
a
tall
handsome
man
with
a
trimmed
greying
beard
a
jolly
smile
and
a
flashing
dark
eye
his
good
humour
seemed
to
be
permanent
he
had
dignity
without
the
slightest
stiffness
he
was
welcomed
by
his
equals
and
frankly
adored
by
his
inferiors
he
ought
to
have
been
chief
bailiff
for
he
was
rich
enough
but
there
intervened
a
mysterious
obstacle
between
daniel
povey
and
the
supreme
honour
a
scarcely
tangible
impediment
which
could
not
be
definitely
stated
he
was
capable
honest
industrious
successful
and
an
excellent
speaker
and
if
he
did
not
belong
to
the
austerer
section
of
society
if
for
example
he
thought
nothing
of
dropping
into
the
tiger
for
a
glass
of
beer
or
of
using
an
oath
occasionally
or
of
telling
a
facetious
story
well
in
a
busy
town
of
thirty
thousand
inhabitants
such
proclivities
are
no
bar
whatever
to
perfect
esteem
but
how
is
one
to
phrase
it
without
wronging
daniel
povey
he
was
entirely
moral
his
views
were
unexceptionable
the
truth
is
that
for
the
ruling
classes
of
bursley
daniel
povey
was
just
a
little
too
fanatical
a
worshipper
of
the
god
pan
he
was
one
of
the
remnant
who
had
kept
alive
the
great
pan
tradition
from
the
days
of
the
regency
through
the
vast
arid
victorian
expanse
of
years
the
flighty
character
of
his
wife
was
regarded
by
many
as
a
judgment
upon
him
for
the
robust
rabelaisianism
of
his
more
private
conversation
for
his
frank
interest
in
his
eternal
preoccupation
with
aspects
of
life
and
human
activity
which
though
essential
to
the
divine
purpose
are
not
openly
recognized
as
such
even
by
daniel
poveys
it
was
not
a
question
of
his
conduct
it
was
a
question
of
the
cast
of
his
mind
if
it
did
not
explain
his
friendship
with
the
rector
of
luke
it
explained
his
departure
from
the
primitive
methodist
connexion
to
which
the
poveys
as
a
family
had
belonged
since
primitive
methodism
was
created
in
turnhill
in
daniel
povey
had
a
way
of
assuming
that
every
male
was
boiling
over
with
interest
in
the
sacred
cult
of
pan
the
assumption
though
sometimes
causing
inconvenience
at
first
usually
conquered
by
virtue
of
its
inherent
truthfulness
thus
it
fell
out
with
samuel
samuel
had
not
suspected
that
pan
had
silken
cords
to
draw
him
he
had
always
averted
his
eyes
from
the
god
that
is
to
say
within
reason
yet
now
daniel
on
perhaps
a
couple
of
fine
mornings
a
week
in
full
square
with
fan
sitting
behind
on
the
cold
stones
and
critchlow
ironic
at
his
door
in
a
long
white
apron
would
entertain
samuel
povey
for
half
an
hour
with
pan
most
intimate
lore
and
samuel
povey
would
not
blench
he
would
on
the
contrary
stand
up
to
daniel
like
a
little
man
and
pretend
with
all
his
might
to
be
potentially
a
perfect
of
the
god
daniel
taught
him
a
lot
turned
over
the
page
of
life
for
him
as
it
were
and
showing
the
reverse
side
seemed
to
say
you
were
missing
all
that
samuel
gazed
upwards
at
the
handsome
long
nose
and
rich
lips
of
his
elder
cousin
so
experienced
so
agreeable
so
renowned
so
esteemed
so
philosophic
and
admitted
to
himself
that
he
had
lived
to
the
age
of
forty
in
a
state
of
comparative
boobyism
and
then
he
would
gaze
downwards
at
the
faint
patch
of
flour
on
daniel
right
leg
and
conceive
that
life
was
and
must
be
life
not
many
weeks
after
his
initiation
into
the
cult
he
was
startled
by
constance
preoccupied
face
one
evening
now
a
husband
of
six
standing
to
whom
it
has
not
happened
to
become
a
father
is
not
easily
startled
by
such
a
face
as
constance
wore
years
ago
he
had
frequently
been
startled
had
frequently
lived
in
suspense
for
a
few
days
but
he
had
long
since
grown
impervious
to
these
alarms
and
now
he
was
startled
again
but
as
a
man
may
be
startled
who
is
not
altogether
surprised
at
being
startled
and
seven
endless
days
passed
and
samuel
and
constance
glanced
at
each
other
like
guilty
things
whose
secret
refuses
to
be
kept
then
three
more
days
passed
and
another
three
then
samuel
povey
remarked
in
a
firm
masculine
tone
oh
there
no
doubt
about
it
and
they
glanced
at
each
other
like
conspirators
who
have
lighted
a
fuse
and
can
not
take
refuge
in
flight
their
eyes
said
continually
with
a
delicious
an
enchanting
mixture
of
ingenuous
modesty
and
fearful
joy
well
we
gone
and
done
it
there
it
was
the
incredible
incomprehensible
future
coming
samuel
had
never
correctly
imagined
the
manner
of
its
heralding
he
had
imagined
in
his
early
simplicity
that
one
day
constance
blushing
might
put
her
mouth
to
his
ear
and
whisper
something
positive
it
had
not
occurred
in
the
least
like
that
but
things
are
so
obstinately
so
incurably
unsentimental
i
think
we
ought
to
drive
over
and
tell
mother
on
sunday
said
constance
his
impulse
was
to
reply
in
his
grand
offhand
style
oh
a
letter
will
do
but
he
checked
himself
and
said
with
careful
deference
you
think
that
will
be
better
than
writing
all
was
changed
he
braced
every
fibre
to
meet
destiny
and
to
help
constance
to
meet
it
the
weather
threatened
on
sunday
he
went
to
axe
without
constance
his
cousin
drove
him
there
in
a
and
he
announced
that
he
should
walk
home
as
the
exercise
would
do
him
good
during
the
drive
daniel
in
whom
he
had
not
confided
chattered
as
usual
and
samuel
pretended
to
listen
with
the
same
attitude
as
usual
but
secretly
he
despised
daniel
for
a
man
who
has
got
something
not
of
the
first
importance
on
the
brain
his
perspective
was
truer
than
daniel
he
walked
home
as
he
had
decided
over
the
wavy
moorland
of
the
county
dreaming
in
the
heart
of
england
night
fell
on
him
in
and
he
was
tired
but
the
earth
as
it
whirled
through
naked
space
whirled
up
the
moon
for
him
and
he
pressed
on
at
a
good
speed
a
wind
from
arabia
wandering
cooled
his
face
and
at
last
over
the
brow
of
toft
end
he
saw
suddenly
the
five
towns
on
their
little
hills
down
in
the
vast
amphitheatre
and
one
of
those
lamps
was
lamp
one
somewhere
he
lived
then
he
entered
into
the
shadow
of
nature
the
mysteries
made
him
solemn
what
a
boneshaker
his
cousin
and
then
this
well
i
damned
well
i
damned
he
kept
repeating
he
who
never
swore
chapter
iii
cyril
i
constance
stood
at
the
large
window
in
the
parlour
she
was
stouter
although
always
plump
her
figure
had
been
comely
with
a
neat
waist
but
now
the
shapeliness
had
gone
the
no
longer
existed
and
there
were
no
more
crinolines
to
create
it
artificially
an
observer
not
under
the
charm
of
her
face
might
have
been
excused
for
calling
her
fat
and
lumpy
the
face
grave
kind
and
expectant
with
its
radiant
fresh
cheeks
and
the
rounded
softness
of
its
curves
atoned
for
the
figure
she
was
nearly
years
of
age
it
was
late
in
october
in
wedgwood
street
next
to
boulton
terrace
all
the
little
brown
houses
had
been
pulled
down
to
make
room
for
a
palatial
covered
market
whose
foundations
were
then
being
dug
this
destruction
exposed
a
vast
area
of
sky
to
the
a
great
dark
cloud
with
an
untidy
edge
rose
massively
out
of
the
depths
and
curtained
off
the
tender
blue
of
approaching
dusk
while
in
the
west
behind
constance
the
sun
was
setting
in
calm
and
gorgeous
melancholy
on
the
thursday
hush
of
the
town
it
was
one
of
those
afternoons
which
gather
up
all
the
sadness
of
the
moving
earth
and
transform
it
into
beauty
samuel
povey
turned
the
corner
from
wedgwood
street
and
crossed
king
street
obliquely
to
the
which
constance
opened
he
seemed
tired
and
anxious
well
demanded
constance
as
he
entered
she
no
better
there
no
getting
away
from
it
she
worse
i
should
have
stayed
only
i
knew
you
be
worrying
so
i
caught
the
how
is
that
gilchrist
shaping
as
a
nurse
she
very
good
said
samuel
with
conviction
very
good
what
a
blessing
i
suppose
you
did
happen
to
see
the
doctor
yes
i
did
what
did
he
say
to
you
samuel
gave
a
deprecating
gesture
did
say
anything
particular
with
dropsy
at
that
stage
you
know
constance
had
returned
to
the
window
her
expectancy
apparently
unappeased
i
do
like
the
look
of
that
cloud
she
murmured
what
are
they
out
still
samuel
inquired
taking
off
his
overcoat
here
they
are
cried
constance
her
features
suddenly
transfigured
she
sprang
to
the
door
pulled
it
open
and
descended
the
steps
a
perambulator
was
being
rapidly
pushed
up
the
slope
by
a
breathless
girl
amy
constance
gently
protested
i
told
you
not
to
venture
far
i
hurried
all
i
could
mum
soon
as
i
seed
that
cloud
the
girl
puffed
with
the
air
of
one
who
is
seriously
thankful
to
have
escaped
a
great
disaster
constance
dived
into
the
recesses
of
the
perambulator
and
extricated
from
its
cocoon
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
scrutinized
him
with
quiet
passion
and
then
rushed
with
him
into
the
house
though
not
a
drop
of
rain
had
yet
fallen
precious
exclaimed
amy
in
ecstasy
her
young
virginal
eyes
following
him
till
he
disappeared
then
she
wheeled
away
the
perambulator
which
now
had
no
more
value
nor
interest
than
an
it
was
necessary
to
take
it
right
round
to
the
brougham
street
yard
entrance
past
the
front
of
the
closed
shop
constance
sat
down
on
the
horsehair
sofa
and
hugged
and
kissed
her
prize
before
removing
his
bonnet
here
daddy
she
said
to
him
as
if
imparting
strange
and
rapturous
tidings
here
daddy
come
back
from
hanging
up
his
coat
in
the
passage
daddy
rubbing
his
hands
and
then
with
a
swift
transition
of
voice
and
features
do
look
at
him
sam
samuel
preoccupied
stooped
forward
oh
you
little
scoundrel
oh
you
little
scoundrel
he
greeted
the
baby
advancing
his
finger
towards
the
baby
nose
the
baby
who
had
hitherto
maintained
a
passive
indifference
to
external
phenomena
lifted
elbows
and
toes
blew
bubbles
from
his
tiny
mouth
and
stared
at
the
finger
with
the
most
ravishing
roguish
smile
as
though
saying
i
know
that
great
limb
and
there
is
a
joke
about
it
which
no
one
but
me
can
see
and
which
is
my
secret
joy
that
you
shall
never
share
tea
ready
samuel
asked
resuming
his
gravity
and
his
ordinary
pose
you
must
give
the
girl
time
to
take
her
things
off
said
constance
we
have
the
table
drawn
away
from
the
fire
and
baby
can
lie
on
his
shawl
on
the
hearthrug
while
we
having
tea
then
to
the
baby
in
rapture
and
play
with
his
toys
all
his
nice
nice
toys
you
know
miss
insull
is
staying
for
tea
constance
her
head
bent
over
the
baby
who
formed
a
white
patch
on
her
comfortable
brown
frock
nodded
without
speaking
samuel
povey
walking
to
and
fro
began
to
enter
into
details
of
his
hasty
journey
to
axe
old
baines
having
beheld
her
grandson
was
preparing
to
quit
this
world
never
again
would
she
exclaim
in
her
brusque
tone
of
genial
ruthlessness
the
situation
was
very
difficult
and
distressing
for
constance
could
not
leave
her
baby
and
she
would
not
until
the
last
urgency
run
the
risks
of
a
journey
with
him
to
axe
he
was
being
weaned
in
any
case
constance
could
not
have
undertaken
the
nursing
of
her
mother
a
nurse
had
to
be
found
povey
had
discovered
one
in
the
person
of
gilchrist
the
second
wife
of
a
farmer
at
malpas
in
cheshire
whose
first
wife
had
been
a
sister
of
the
late
john
baines
all
the
credit
of
gilchrist
was
due
to
samuel
povey
baines
fretted
seriously
about
sophia
who
had
given
no
sign
of
life
for
a
very
long
time
povey
went
to
manchester
and
ascertained
definitely
from
the
relatives
of
scales
that
nothing
was
known
of
the
pair
he
did
not
go
to
manchester
especially
on
this
errand
about
once
in
three
weeks
on
tuesdays
he
had
to
visit
the
manchester
warehouses
but
the
tracking
of
scales
relative
cost
him
so
much
trouble
and
time
that
curiously
he
came
to
believe
that
he
had
gone
to
manchester
one
tuesday
for
no
other
end
although
he
was
very
busy
indeed
in
the
shop
he
flew
over
to
axe
and
back
whenever
he
possibly
could
to
the
neglect
of
his
affairs
he
was
glad
to
do
all
that
was
in
his
power
even
if
he
had
not
done
it
graciously
his
sensitive
tyrannic
conscience
would
have
forced
him
to
do
it
but
nevertheless
he
felt
rather
virtuous
and
worry
and
fatigue
and
loss
of
sleep
intensified
this
sense
of
virtue
so
that
if
there
is
any
sudden
change
they
will
telegraph
he
finished
to
constance
she
raised
her
head
the
words
clinching
what
had
led
up
to
them
drew
her
from
her
dream
and
she
saw
for
a
moment
her
mother
in
an
agony
but
you
do
surely
mean
she
began
trying
to
disperse
the
painful
vision
as
unjustified
by
the
facts
my
dear
girl
said
samuel
with
head
singing
and
hot
eyes
and
a
consciousness
of
high
tension
in
every
nerve
of
his
body
i
simply
mean
that
if
there
any
sudden
change
they
will
telegraph
while
they
had
tea
samuel
sitting
opposite
to
his
wife
and
miss
insull
nearly
against
the
wall
owing
to
the
moving
of
the
table
the
baby
rolled
about
on
the
hearthrug
which
had
been
covered
with
a
large
soft
woollen
shawl
originally
the
property
of
his
he
had
no
cares
no
responsibilities
the
shawl
was
so
vast
that
he
could
not
clearly
distinguish
objects
beyond
its
confines
on
it
lay
an
indiarubber
ball
an
indiarubber
doll
a
rattle
and
fan
he
vaguely
recollected
all
four
items
with
their
respective
properties
the
fire
also
was
an
old
friend
he
had
occasionally
tried
to
touch
it
but
a
high
bright
fence
always
came
in
between
for
ten
months
he
had
never
spent
a
day
without
making
experiments
on
this
shifting
universe
in
which
he
alone
remained
firm
and
stationary
the
experiments
were
chiefly
conducted
out
of
idle
amusement
but
he
was
serious
on
the
subject
of
food
lately
the
behaviour
of
the
universe
in
regard
to
his
food
had
somewhat
perplexed
him
had
indeed
annoyed
him
however
he
was
of
a
forgetful
happy
disposition
and
so
long
as
the
universe
continued
to
fulfil
its
sole
end
as
a
machinery
for
the
satisfaction
somehow
of
his
imperious
desires
he
was
not
inclined
to
remonstrate
he
gazed
at
the
flames
and
laughed
and
laughed
because
he
had
laughed
he
pushed
the
ball
away
and
wriggled
after
it
and
captured
it
with
the
assurance
of
practice
he
tried
to
swallow
the
doll
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
tried
several
times
to
swallow
it
that
he
remembered
the
failure
of
previous
efforts
and
philosophically
desisted
he
rolled
with
a
fearful
shock
arms
and
legs
in
air
against
the
mountainous
flank
of
that
mammoth
fan
and
clutched
at
fan
ear
the
whole
mass
of
fan
upheaved
and
vanished
from
his
view
and
was
instantly
forgotten
by
him
he
seized
the
doll
and
tried
to
swallow
it
and
repeated
the
exhibition
of
his
skill
with
the
ball
then
he
saw
the
fire
again
and
laughed
and
so
he
existed
for
centuries
no
responsibilities
no
appetites
and
the
shawl
was
vast
terrific
operations
went
on
over
his
head
giants
moved
to
and
fro
great
vessels
were
carried
off
and
great
books
were
brought
and
deep
voices
rumbled
regularly
in
the
spaces
beyond
the
shawl
but
he
remained
oblivious
at
last
he
became
aware
that
a
face
was
looking
down
at
his
he
recognized
it
and
immediately
an
uncomfortable
sensation
in
his
stomach
disturbed
him
he
tolerated
it
for
fifty
years
or
so
and
then
he
gave
a
little
cry
life
had
resumed
its
seriousness
black
alpaca
b
quality
width
yards
miss
insull
read
out
of
a
great
book
she
and
povey
were
checking
stock
and
povey
responded
black
alpaca
b
quality
width
yards
it
wants
ten
minutes
yet
he
had
glanced
at
the
clock
does
it
said
constance
well
knowing
that
it
wanted
ten
minutes
the
baby
did
not
guess
that
a
high
invisible
god
named
samuel
povey
whom
nothing
escaped
and
who
could
do
everything
at
once
was
controlling
his
universe
from
an
inconceivable
distance
on
the
contrary
the
baby
was
crying
to
himself
there
is
no
god
his
weaning
had
reached
the
stage
at
which
a
baby
really
does
not
know
what
will
happen
next
the
annoyance
had
begun
exactly
three
months
after
his
first
tooth
such
being
the
rule
of
the
gods
and
it
had
grown
more
and
more
disconcerting
no
sooner
did
he
accustom
himself
to
a
new
phenomenon
than
it
mysteriously
ceased
and
an
old
one
took
its
place
which
he
had
utterly
forgotten
this
afternoon
his
mother
nursed
him
but
not
until
she
had
foolishly
attempted
to
divert
him
from
the
seriousness
of
life
by
means
of
gewgaws
of
which
he
was
sick
still
once
at
her
rich
breast
he
forgave
and
forgot
all
he
preferred
her
simple
natural
breast
to
more
modern
inventions
and
he
had
no
shame
no
modesty
nor
had
his
mother
it
was
an
indecent
carouse
at
which
his
father
and
miss
insull
had
to
assist
but
his
father
had
shame
his
father
would
have
preferred
that
as
miss
insull
had
kindly
offered
to
stop
and
work
on
thursday
afternoon
and
as
the
shop
was
chilly
the
due
rotation
should
have
brought
the
bottle
round
at
five
and
not
the
mother
breast
he
was
a
parent
rather
apologetic
to
the
world
rather
apt
to
stand
off
and
pretend
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
affair
and
he
genuinely
disliked
that
anybody
should
witness
the
intimate
scene
of
his
wife
feeding
his
baby
especially
miss
insull
that
prim
dark
moustached
spinster
he
would
not
have
called
it
an
outrage
on
miss
insull
to
force
her
to
witness
the
scene
but
his
idea
approached
within
sight
of
the
word
constance
blandly
offered
herself
to
the
child
with
the
unconscious
primitive
savagery
of
a
young
mother
and
as
the
baby
fed
thoughts
of
her
own
mother
flitted
to
and
fro
ceaselessly
like
vague
shapes
over
the
deep
sea
of
content
which
filled
her
mind
this
illness
of
her
mother
was
abnormal
and
the
baby
was
now
for
the
first
time
perhaps
entirely
normal
in
her
consciousness
the
baby
was
something
which
could
be
disturbed
not
something
which
did
disturb
what
a
change
what
a
change
that
had
seemed
impossible
until
its
full
accomplishment
for
months
before
the
birth
she
had
glimpsed
at
nights
and
in
other
silent
hours
the
tremendous
upset
she
had
not
allowed
herself
to
be
silly
in
advance
by
temperament
she
was
too
sagacious
too
well
balanced
for
that
but
she
had
had
fitful
instants
of
terror
when
solid
ground
seemed
to
sink
away
from
her
and
imagination
shook
at
what
faced
her
instants
only
usually
she
could
play
the
comedy
of
sensible
calmness
to
almost
perfection
then
the
appointed
time
drew
nigh
and
still
she
smiled
and
samuel
smiled
but
the
preparations
meticulous
intricate
revolutionary
belied
their
smiles
the
intense
resolve
to
keep
baines
by
methods
scrupulous
or
unscrupulous
away
from
bursley
until
all
was
over
belied
their
smiles
and
then
the
first
pains
sharp
shocking
cruel
heralds
of
torture
but
when
they
had
withdrawn
she
smiled
again
palely
then
she
was
in
bed
full
of
the
sensation
that
the
whole
house
was
inverted
and
disorganized
hopelessly
and
the
doctor
came
into
the
room
she
smiled
at
the
doctor
apologetically
foolishly
as
if
saying
we
all
come
to
it
here
i
am
she
was
calm
without
oh
but
what
a
prey
of
abject
fear
within
i
am
at
the
edge
of
the
precipice
her
thought
ran
in
a
moment
i
shall
be
over
and
then
the
pains
not
the
heralds
but
the
shattering
army
endless
increasing
in
terror
as
they
thundered
across
her
yet
she
could
think
quite
clearly
now
i
in
the
middle
of
it
this
is
it
the
horror
that
i
have
not
dared
to
look
at
my
life
in
the
balance
i
may
never
get
up
again
all
has
at
last
come
to
pass
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
never
come
as
if
this
thing
could
not
happen
to
me
but
at
last
it
has
come
to
pass
ah
some
one
put
the
twisted
end
of
a
towel
into
her
hand
again
she
had
loosed
it
and
she
pulled
pulled
enough
to
break
cables
and
then
she
shrieked
it
was
for
pity
it
was
for
some
one
to
help
her
at
any
rate
to
take
notice
of
her
she
was
dying
her
soul
was
leaving
her
and
she
was
alone
in
the
midst
of
a
cataclysm
a
thousand
times
surpassing
all
that
she
had
imagined
of
sickening
horror
i
can
not
endure
this
she
thought
passionately
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
be
asked
to
endure
this
and
then
she
wept
beaten
terrorized
smashed
and
riven
no
commonsense
now
no
wise
calmness
now
no
now
why
not
even
a
woman
now
nothing
but
a
kind
of
animalized
victim
and
then
the
supreme
endless
spasm
during
which
she
gave
up
the
ghost
and
bade
to
her
very
self
she
was
lying
quite
comfortable
in
the
soft
bed
idle
silly
happiness
forming
like
a
thin
crust
over
the
lava
of
her
anguish
and
her
fright
and
by
her
side
was
the
soul
that
had
fought
its
way
out
of
her
ruthlessly
the
secret
disturber
revealed
to
the
light
of
morning
curious
to
look
at
not
like
any
baby
that
she
had
ever
seen
red
creased
brutish
but
for
some
reason
that
she
did
not
examine
she
folded
it
in
an
immense
tenderness
sam
was
by
the
bed
away
from
her
eyes
she
was
so
comfortable
and
silly
that
she
could
not
move
her
head
nor
even
ask
him
to
come
round
to
her
eyes
she
had
to
wait
till
he
came
in
the
afternoon
the
doctor
returned
and
astounded
her
by
saying
that
hers
had
been
an
ideal
confinement
she
was
too
weary
to
rebuke
him
for
a
senseless
blind
callous
old
man
but
she
knew
what
she
knew
no
one
will
ever
guess
she
thought
no
one
ever
can
guess
what
been
through
talk
as
you
like
i
know
now
gradually
she
had
resumed
cognizance
of
her
household
perceiving
that
it
was
demoralized
from
top
to
bottom
and
that
when
the
time
came
to
begin
upon
it
she
would
not
be
able
to
settle
where
to
begin
even
supposing
that
the
baby
were
not
there
to
monopolize
her
attention
the
task
appalled
her
then
she
wanted
to
get
up
then
she
got
up
what
a
blow
to
she
went
back
to
bed
like
a
little
scared
rabbit
to
its
hole
glad
glad
to
be
on
the
soft
pillows
again
she
said
yet
the
time
must
come
when
i
shall
be
downstairs
and
walking
about
and
meeting
people
and
cooking
and
superintending
the
millinery
well
it
did
come
except
that
she
had
to
renounce
the
millinery
to
miss
insull
but
it
was
not
the
same
no
different
the
baby
pushed
everything
else
on
to
another
plane
he
was
a
terrific
intruder
not
one
minute
of
her
old
daily
life
was
left
he
made
no
compromise
whatever
if
she
turned
away
her
gaze
from
him
he
might
pop
off
into
eternity
and
leave
her
and
now
she
was
calmly
and
sensibly
giving
him
suck
in
presence
of
miss
insull
she
was
used
to
his
importance
to
the
fragility
of
his
organism
to
waking
twice
every
night
to
being
fat
she
was
strong
again
the
convulsive
twitching
that
for
six
months
had
worried
her
repose
had
quite
disappeared
the
state
of
being
a
mother
was
normal
and
the
baby
was
so
normal
that
she
could
not
conceive
the
house
without
him
all
in
ten
months
when
the
baby
was
installed
in
his
cot
for
the
night
she
came
downstairs
and
found
miss
insull
and
samuel
still
working
and
larder
than
ever
but
at
addition
sums
now
she
sat
down
leaving
the
door
open
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
had
embroidery
in
hand
a
cap
and
while
miss
insull
and
samuel
combined
pounds
shillings
and
pence
whispering
at
great
speed
she
bent
over
the
delicate
intimate
wasteful
handiwork
drawing
the
needle
with
slow
exactitude
then
she
would
raise
her
head
and
listen
excuse
me
said
miss
insull
i
think
i
hear
baby
crying
and
two
are
eight
and
three
are
eleven
he
must
cry
said
povey
rapidly
without
looking
up
the
baby
parents
did
not
make
a
practice
of
discussing
their
domestic
existence
even
with
miss
insull
but
constance
had
to
justify
herself
as
a
mother
i
made
perfectly
sure
he
comfortable
said
constance
he
only
crying
because
he
fancies
he
neglected
and
we
think
he
ca
begin
too
early
to
learn
how
right
you
are
said
miss
insull
two
and
carry
three
that
distant
feeble
querulous
pitiful
cry
continued
obstinately
it
continued
for
thirty
minutes
constance
could
not
proceed
with
her
work
the
cry
disintegrated
her
will
dissolved
her
hard
sagacity
without
a
word
she
crept
upstairs
having
carefully
deposed
the
cap
on
her
povey
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
bounded
up
after
her
startling
fan
he
shut
the
door
on
miss
insull
but
fan
was
too
quick
for
him
he
saw
constance
with
her
hand
on
the
bedroom
door
my
dear
girl
he
protested
holding
himself
in
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
just
listening
said
constance
do
be
reasonable
and
come
downstairs
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
scarcely
masking
his
nervous
irritation
and
tiptoed
along
the
corridor
towards
her
and
up
the
two
steps
past
the
fan
followed
wagging
her
tail
expectant
suppose
he
not
well
constance
suggested
pshaw
povey
exclaimed
contemptuously
you
remember
what
happened
last
night
and
what
you
said
they
argued
subduing
their
tones
to
the
false
semblance
of
there
in
the
closeness
of
the
corridor
fan
deceived
ceased
to
wag
her
tail
and
then
trotted
away
the
baby
cry
behind
the
door
rose
to
a
mysterious
despairing
howl
which
had
such
an
effect
on
constance
heart
that
she
could
have
walked
through
fire
to
reach
the
baby
but
povey
will
held
her
and
she
rebelled
angry
hurt
resentful
commonsense
the
ideal
of
mutual
forbearance
had
winged
away
from
that
excited
pair
it
would
have
assuredly
ended
in
a
quarrel
with
samuel
glaring
at
her
in
black
fury
from
the
other
side
of
a
bottomless
chasm
had
not
miss
insull
most
surprisingly
burst
up
the
stairs
povey
turned
to
face
her
swallowing
his
emotion
a
telegram
said
miss
insull
the
postmaster
brought
it
down
himself
what
mr
derry
asked
samuel
opening
the
telegram
with
an
affectation
of
majesty
yes
he
said
it
was
too
late
for
delivery
by
rights
but
as
it
seemed
very
important
samuel
scanned
it
and
nodded
gravely
then
gave
it
to
his
wife
tears
came
into
her
eyes
i
get
cousin
daniel
to
drive
me
over
at
once
said
samuel
master
of
himself
and
of
the
situation
would
it
be
better
to
hire
constance
suggested
she
had
a
prejudice
against
daniel
povey
shook
his
head
he
offered
he
replied
i
ca
refuse
his
offer
put
your
thick
overcoat
on
dear
said
constance
in
a
dream
descending
with
him
i
hope
it
is
miss
insull
stopped
yes
it
is
miss
insull
said
samuel
deliberately
in
less
than
a
minute
he
was
gone
constance
ran
upstairs
but
the
cry
had
ceased
she
turned
the
softly
slowly
and
crept
into
the
chamber
a
made
large
shadows
among
the
heavy
mahogany
and
the
crimson
tasselled
rep
in
the
room
and
between
the
bed
and
the
ottoman
on
which
lay
samuel
family
bible
the
cot
loomed
in
the
shadows
she
picked
up
the
and
stole
round
the
bed
yes
he
had
decided
to
fall
asleep
the
hazard
of
death
afar
off
had
just
defeated
his
devilish
obstinacy
fate
had
bested
him
how
marvellously
soft
and
delicate
that
cheek
how
frail
that
tiny
tiny
clenched
hand
in
constance
grief
and
joy
were
mystically
united
ii
the
was
full
of
visitors
in
frocks
of
ceremony
the
old
but
newly
and
massively
arranged
with
the
finest
victorian
furniture
from
dead
aunt
harriet
house
at
axe
two
canterburys
a
large
bookcase
a
splendid
scintillant
table
solid
beyond
lifting
intricately
tortured
chairs
and
armchairs
the
original
furniture
of
the
was
now
down
in
the
parlour
making
it
grand
all
the
house
breathed
opulence
it
was
gorged
with
quiet
restrained
expensiveness
the
least
considerable
objects
in
the
most
modest
corners
were
what
baines
would
have
termed
constance
and
samuel
had
half
of
all
aunt
harriet
money
and
half
of
baines
the
other
half
was
accumulating
for
a
hypothetical
sophia
critchlow
being
the
trustee
the
business
continued
to
flourish
people
knew
that
samuel
povey
was
buying
houses
yet
samuel
and
constance
had
not
made
friends
they
had
not
in
the
five
towns
phrase
out
socially
though
they
had
very
meetly
branched
out
on
subscription
lists
they
kept
themselves
to
themselves
emphasizing
the
preposition
these
guests
were
not
their
guests
they
were
the
guests
of
cyril
he
had
been
named
samuel
because
constance
would
have
him
named
after
his
father
and
cyril
because
his
father
secretly
despised
the
name
of
samuel
and
he
was
called
cyril
cyril
by
amy
definite
successor
to
maggie
his
mother
thoughts
were
on
cyril
as
long
as
she
was
awake
his
father
when
not
planning
cyril
welfare
was
earning
money
whose
unique
object
could
be
nothing
but
cyril
welfare
cyril
was
the
pivot
of
the
house
every
desire
ended
somewhere
in
cyril
the
shop
existed
now
solely
for
him
and
those
houses
that
samuel
bought
by
private
treaty
or
with
a
shamefaced
air
at
auctions
somehow
they
were
aimed
at
cyril
samuel
and
constance
had
ceased
to
be
beings
they
never
thought
of
themselves
save
as
the
parents
of
cyril
they
realized
this
by
no
means
fully
had
they
been
accused
of
monomania
they
would
have
smiled
the
smile
of
people
confident
in
their
commonsense
and
their
mental
balance
nevertheless
they
were
monomaniacs
instinctively
they
concealed
the
fact
as
much
as
possible
they
never
admitted
it
even
to
themselves
samuel
indeed
would
often
say
that
child
is
not
everybody
that
child
must
be
kept
in
his
place
constance
was
always
teaching
him
consideration
for
his
father
as
the
most
important
person
in
the
household
samuel
was
always
teaching
him
consideration
for
his
mother
as
the
most
important
person
in
the
household
nothing
was
left
undone
to
convince
him
that
he
was
a
cipher
a
nonentity
who
ought
to
be
very
glad
to
be
alive
but
he
knew
all
about
his
importance
he
knew
that
the
entire
town
was
his
he
knew
that
his
parents
were
deceiving
themselves
even
when
he
was
punished
he
well
knew
that
it
was
because
he
was
so
important
he
never
imparted
any
portion
of
this
knowledge
to
his
parents
a
primeval
wisdom
prompted
him
to
retain
it
strictly
in
his
own
bosom
he
was
four
and
a
half
years
old
dark
like
his
father
handsome
like
his
aunt
and
tall
for
his
age
not
one
of
his
features
resembled
a
feature
of
his
mother
but
sometimes
he
her
look
from
the
capricious
production
of
inarticulate
sounds
and
then
a
few
monosyllables
that
described
concrete
things
and
obvious
desires
he
had
gradually
acquired
an
astonishing
idiomatic
command
over
the
most
difficult
of
teutonic
languages
there
was
nothing
that
he
could
not
say
he
could
walk
and
run
was
full
of
exact
knowledge
about
god
and
entertained
no
doubt
concerning
the
special
partiality
of
a
minor
deity
called
jesus
towards
himself
now
this
party
was
his
mother
invention
and
scheme
his
father
after
flouting
it
had
said
that
if
it
was
to
be
done
at
all
it
should
be
done
well
and
had
brought
to
the
doing
all
his
organizing
skill
cyril
had
accepted
it
at
first
merely
accepted
it
but
as
the
day
approached
and
the
preparations
increased
in
magnitude
he
had
come
to
look
on
it
with
favour
then
with
enthusiasm
his
father
having
taken
him
to
daniel
povey
opposite
to
choose
cakes
he
had
shown
by
his
solemn
and
fastidious
waverings
how
seriously
he
regarded
the
affair
of
course
it
had
to
occur
on
a
thursday
afternoon
the
season
was
summer
suitable
for
pale
and
fragile
toilettes
and
the
eight
children
who
sat
round
aunt
harriet
great
table
glittered
like
the
sun
not
constance
specially
provided
napkins
could
hide
that
wealth
and
profusion
of
white
lace
and
stitchery
never
in
are
the
genteel
children
of
the
five
towns
so
richly
clad
as
at
the
age
of
four
or
five
years
weeks
of
labour
thousands
of
cubic
feet
of
gas
whole
nights
stolen
from
repose
eyesight
and
general
health
will
disappear
into
the
manufacture
of
a
single
frock
that
accidental
jam
may
ruin
in
ten
seconds
thus
it
was
in
those
old
days
and
thus
it
is
cyril
guests
ranged
in
years
from
four
to
six
they
were
chiefly
older
than
their
host
this
was
a
pity
it
impaired
his
importance
but
up
to
four
years
a
child
sense
of
propriety
even
of
common
decency
is
altogether
too
unreliable
for
a
respectable
party
round
about
the
outskirts
of
the
table
were
the
elders
ladies
the
majority
they
also
in
their
best
for
they
had
to
meet
each
other
constance
displayed
a
new
dress
of
crimson
silk
after
having
mourned
for
her
mother
she
had
definitely
abandoned
the
black
which
by
reason
of
her
duties
in
the
shop
she
had
constantly
worn
from
the
age
of
sixteen
to
within
a
few
months
of
cyril
birth
she
never
went
into
the
shop
now
except
casually
on
brief
visits
of
inspection
she
was
still
fat
the
destroyer
of
her
figure
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
samuel
kept
close
to
her
he
was
the
only
male
until
critchlow
astonishingly
arrived
among
the
company
critchlow
had
a
samuel
if
not
in
his
best
was
certainly
not
in
his
everyday
suit
with
his
large
frilled
and
small
black
tie
and
his
little
black
beard
and
dark
face
over
that
he
looked
very
nervous
and
he
had
not
the
habit
of
entertaining
nor
had
constance
but
her
benevolence
ever
bubbling
up
to
the
calm
surface
of
her
personality
made
impossible
for
her
miss
insull
was
also
present
in
help
lastly
there
was
amy
now
as
the
years
passed
slowly
assuming
the
character
of
a
faithful
retainer
though
she
was
only
an
ugly
abrupt
downright
girl
with
convenient
notions
of
pleasure
for
she
would
rise
early
and
retire
late
in
order
to
contrive
an
hour
to
go
out
with
master
cyril
and
to
be
allowed
to
put
master
cyril
to
bed
was
really
her
highest
bliss
all
these
elders
were
continually
inserting
arms
into
the
fringe
of
fluffy
children
that
surrounded
the
heaped
table
removing
dangerous
spoons
out
of
cups
into
saucers
replacing
plates
passing
cakes
spreading
jam
whispering
consolations
explanations
and
sage
counsel
critchlow
now
but
unbent
remarked
that
there
was
pretty
cackle
and
he
sniffed
although
the
window
was
slightly
open
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
natural
human
odour
which
young
children
transpire
more
than
one
mother
pressing
her
nose
into
a
lacy
mass
to
whisper
inhaled
that
pleasant
perfume
with
a
voluptuous
thrill
cyril
while
attending
steadily
to
the
demands
of
his
body
was
in
a
mood
which
approached
the
ideal
proud
and
radiant
he
combined
urbanity
with
a
certain
fine
condescension
his
bright
eyes
and
his
manner
of
scraping
up
jam
with
a
spoon
said
i
am
the
king
of
this
party
this
party
is
solely
in
my
honour
i
know
that
we
all
know
it
still
i
will
pretend
that
we
are
equals
you
and
i
he
talked
about
his
to
a
young
woman
on
his
right
named
jennie
aged
four
pale
pretty
the
belle
in
fact
and
critchlow
the
boy
attractiveness
was
indisputable
he
could
put
on
quite
an
aristocratic
air
it
was
the
most
delicious
sight
to
see
them
cyril
and
jennie
so
soft
and
delicate
so
infantile
on
their
piles
of
cushions
and
books
with
their
white
socks
and
black
shoes
dangling
far
distant
from
the
carpet
and
yet
so
old
so
and
they
were
merely
an
epitome
of
the
whole
table
the
whole
table
was
bathed
in
the
charm
and
mystery
of
young
years
of
helpless
fragility
gentle
forms
timid
elegance
unshamed
instincts
and
waking
souls
constance
and
samuel
were
very
satisfied
full
of
praise
for
other
children
but
with
the
reserve
that
of
course
cyril
was
hors
concours
they
both
really
did
believe
at
that
moment
that
cyril
was
in
some
subtle
way
which
they
felt
but
could
not
define
superior
to
all
other
infants
some
one
some
officious
relative
of
a
visitor
began
to
pass
a
certain
cake
which
had
brown
walls
a
roof
of
icing
and
a
yellow
body
studded
with
crimson
globules
not
a
conspicuously
gorgeous
cake
not
a
cake
to
which
a
catholic
child
would
be
likely
to
attach
particular
importance
a
good
average
cake
who
could
have
guessed
that
it
stood
in
cyril
esteem
as
the
cake
of
cakes
he
had
insisted
on
his
father
buying
it
at
cousin
daniel
and
perhaps
samuel
ought
to
have
divined
that
for
cyril
that
cake
was
the
gleam
that
an
ardent
spirit
would
follow
through
the
wilderness
samuel
however
was
not
a
careful
observer
and
seriously
lacked
imagination
constance
knew
only
that
cyril
had
mentioned
the
cake
once
or
twice
now
by
the
hazard
of
destiny
that
cake
found
much
favour
helped
into
popularity
as
it
was
by
the
blundering
officious
relative
who
not
dreaming
what
volcano
she
was
treading
on
urged
its
merits
with
simpering
enthusiasm
one
boy
took
two
slices
a
slice
in
each
hand
he
happened
to
be
the
visitor
of
whom
the
was
a
relative
and
she
protested
she
expressed
the
shock
she
suffered
whereupon
both
constance
and
samuel
sprang
forward
and
swore
with
angelic
smiles
that
nothing
could
be
more
perfect
than
the
propriety
of
that
dear
little
fellow
taking
two
slices
of
that
cake
it
was
this
hullaballoo
that
drew
cyril
attention
to
the
evanescence
of
the
cake
of
cakes
his
face
at
once
changed
from
calm
pride
to
a
dreadful
anxiety
his
eyes
bulged
out
his
tiny
mouth
grew
and
grew
like
a
mouth
in
a
nightmare
he
was
no
longer
human
he
was
a
tiger
being
balked
of
his
prey
nobody
noticed
him
the
officious
fool
of
a
woman
persuaded
jennie
to
take
the
last
slice
of
the
cake
which
was
quite
a
thin
slice
then
every
one
simultaneously
noticed
cyril
for
he
gave
a
yell
it
was
not
the
cry
of
a
despairing
soul
who
sees
his
beautiful
iridescent
dream
shattered
at
his
feet
it
was
the
cry
of
the
strong
masterful
spirit
furious
he
turned
upon
jennie
sobbing
and
snatched
at
her
cake
unaccustomed
to
such
behaviour
from
hosts
and
being
besides
a
haughty
beauty
of
the
future
jennie
defended
her
cake
after
all
it
was
not
she
who
had
taken
two
slices
at
once
cyril
hit
her
in
the
eye
and
then
crammed
most
of
the
slice
of
cake
into
his
enormous
mouth
he
could
not
swallow
it
nor
even
masticate
it
for
his
throat
was
rigid
and
tight
so
the
cake
projected
from
his
red
lips
and
big
tears
watered
it
the
most
awful
mess
you
can
conceive
jennie
wept
loudly
and
one
or
two
others
joined
her
in
sympathy
but
the
rest
went
on
eating
tranquilly
unmoved
by
the
horror
which
transfixed
their
elders
a
host
to
snatch
food
from
a
guest
a
host
to
strike
a
guest
a
gentleman
to
strike
a
lady
constance
whipped
up
cyril
from
his
chair
and
flew
with
him
to
his
own
room
once
samuel
where
she
smacked
him
on
the
arm
and
told
him
he
was
a
very
very
naughty
boy
and
that
she
did
know
what
his
father
would
say
she
took
the
food
out
of
his
disgusting
mouth
or
as
much
of
it
as
she
could
get
at
and
then
she
left
him
on
the
bed
miss
jennie
was
still
in
tears
when
blushing
scarlet
and
trying
to
smile
constance
returned
to
the
jennie
would
not
be
appeased
happily
jennie
mother
being
about
to
present
jennie
with
a
little
brother
she
hoped
was
not
present
miss
insull
had
promised
to
see
jennie
home
and
it
was
decided
that
she
should
go
critchlow
in
high
sardonic
spirits
said
that
he
would
go
too
the
three
departed
together
heavily
charged
with
constance
love
and
apologies
then
all
pretended
and
said
loudly
that
what
had
happened
was
naught
that
such
things
were
always
happening
at
children
parties
and
relatives
asseverated
that
cyril
was
a
perfect
darling
and
that
really
povey
must
not
but
the
attempt
to
keep
up
appearance
was
a
failure
the
methuselah
of
visitors
a
gaping
girl
of
nearly
eight
years
walked
across
the
room
to
where
constance
was
standing
and
said
in
a
loud
confidential
fatuous
voice
cyril
has
been
a
rude
boy
has
he
mrs
povey
the
clumsiness
of
children
is
sometimes
tragic
later
there
was
a
trickling
stream
of
fluffy
bundles
down
the
crooked
stairs
and
through
the
parlour
and
so
out
into
king
street
and
constance
received
many
compliments
and
sundry
appeals
that
darling
cyril
should
be
forgiven
i
thought
you
said
that
boy
was
in
his
bedroom
said
samuel
to
constance
coming
into
the
parlour
when
the
last
guest
had
gone
each
avoided
the
other
eyes
yes
is
he
no
the
little
jockey
jockey
an
essay
in
the
playful
towards
making
light
of
the
jockey
sin
i
expect
he
been
in
search
of
amy
she
went
to
the
top
of
the
kitchen
stairs
and
called
out
amy
is
master
cyril
down
there
master
cyril
no
mum
but
he
was
in
the
parlour
a
bit
ago
after
the
first
and
second
lot
had
gone
i
told
him
to
go
upstairs
and
be
a
good
boy
not
for
a
few
moments
did
the
suspicion
enter
the
minds
of
samuel
and
constance
that
cyril
might
be
missing
that
the
house
might
not
contain
cyril
but
having
once
entered
the
suspicion
became
a
certainty
amy
burst
into
sudden
tears
admitting
that
the
might
have
been
open
when
having
sped
second
lot
she
criminally
left
cyril
alone
in
the
parlour
in
order
to
descend
for
an
instant
to
her
kitchen
dusk
was
gathering
amy
saw
the
defenceless
innocent
wandering
about
all
night
in
the
deserted
streets
of
a
great
city
a
similar
vision
with
precise
details
of
canals
and
disturbed
constance
samuel
said
that
anyhow
he
could
not
have
got
far
that
some
one
was
bound
to
remark
and
recognize
him
and
restore
him
yes
of
course
thought
sensible
constance
but
supposing
they
all
three
searched
the
entire
house
again
then
in
the
which
was
in
a
sad
condition
of
anticlimax
amy
exclaimed
eh
master
there
crossing
the
square
had
ye
better
have
him
cried
run
out
and
stop
him
constance
commanded
and
amy
flew
samuel
and
the
aged
parleyed
at
the
side
door
the
women
in
the
background
i
canna
cry
him
without
my
bell
drawled
the
crier
stroking
his
shabby
uniform
my
bell
at
wum
home
i
mun
go
and
fetch
my
bell
yo
write
it
down
on
a
bit
o
paper
for
me
so
as
i
can
read
it
and
i
foot
off
for
my
bell
folk
wouldna
listen
to
me
if
i
gotten
my
bell
thus
was
cyril
cried
amy
said
constance
when
she
and
the
girl
were
alone
there
no
use
in
you
standing
blubbering
there
get
to
work
and
clear
up
that
do
the
child
is
sure
to
be
found
soon
your
gone
out
too
brave
words
constance
aided
in
the
and
kitchen
theirs
was
the
woman
lot
in
a
great
crisis
plates
have
always
to
be
washed
very
shortly
afterwards
samuel
povey
came
into
the
kitchen
by
the
underground
passage
which
led
past
the
two
cellars
to
the
yard
and
to
brougham
street
he
was
carrying
in
his
arms
an
obscene
black
mass
this
mass
was
cyril
once
white
constance
screamed
she
was
at
liberty
to
give
way
to
her
feelings
because
amy
happened
to
be
upstairs
stand
away
cried
povey
he
is
fit
to
touch
and
povey
made
as
if
to
pass
directly
onward
ignoring
the
mother
wherever
did
you
find
him
i
found
him
in
the
far
cellar
said
povey
compelled
to
stop
after
all
he
was
down
there
with
me
yesterday
and
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
have
gone
there
again
what
all
in
the
dark
he
lighted
a
candle
if
you
please
i
left
a
and
a
box
of
matches
handy
because
i
had
finished
that
shelving
well
constance
murmured
i
ca
think
how
ever
he
dared
go
there
all
alone
ca
you
said
povey
cynically
i
can
he
simply
did
it
to
frighten
us
oh
cyril
constance
admonished
the
child
cyril
the
child
showed
no
emotion
his
face
was
an
enigma
it
might
have
hidden
sullenness
or
mere
callous
indifference
or
a
perfect
unconsciousness
of
sin
give
him
to
me
said
constance
i
look
after
him
this
evening
said
samuel
grimly
but
you
ca
wash
him
said
constance
her
relief
yielding
to
apprehension
why
not
demanded
povey
and
he
moved
off
but
sam
i
look
after
him
i
tell
you
povey
repeated
threateningly
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
constance
asked
with
fear
well
said
povey
has
this
sort
of
thing
got
to
be
dealt
with
or
has
it
he
departed
upstairs
constance
overtook
him
at
the
door
of
cyril
bedroom
povey
did
not
wait
for
her
to
speak
his
eyes
were
blazing
see
here
he
admonished
her
cruelly
you
get
away
downstairs
mother
and
he
disappeared
into
the
bedroom
with
his
vile
and
helpless
victim
a
moment
later
he
popped
his
head
out
of
the
door
constance
was
disobeying
him
he
stepped
into
the
passage
and
shut
the
door
so
that
cyril
should
not
hear
now
please
do
as
i
tell
you
he
hissed
at
his
wife
do
let
have
a
scene
please
she
descended
slowly
weeping
and
povey
retired
again
to
the
place
of
execution
amy
nearly
fell
on
the
top
of
constance
with
a
final
tray
of
things
from
the
and
constance
had
to
tell
the
girl
that
cyril
was
found
somehow
she
could
not
resist
the
instinct
to
tell
her
also
that
the
master
had
the
affair
in
hand
amy
then
wept
after
about
an
hour
povey
at
last
reappeared
constance
was
trying
to
count
silver
teaspoons
in
the
parlour
he
in
bed
now
said
povey
with
a
magnificent
attempt
to
be
nonchalant
you
must
go
near
him
but
have
you
washed
him
constance
whimpered
i
washed
him
replied
the
astonishing
povey
what
have
you
done
to
him
i
punished
him
of
course
said
povey
like
a
god
who
is
above
human
weaknesses
what
did
you
expect
me
to
do
someone
had
to
do
it
constance
wiped
her
eyes
with
the
edge
of
the
white
apron
which
she
was
wearing
over
her
new
silk
dress
she
surrendered
she
accepted
the
situation
she
made
the
best
of
it
and
all
the
evening
was
spent
in
dismally
and
horribly
pretending
that
their
hearts
were
beating
as
one
povey
elaborate
cheery
kindliness
was
extremely
painful
they
went
to
bed
and
in
their
bedroom
constance
as
she
stood
close
to
samuel
suddenly
dropped
the
pretence
and
with
eyes
and
voice
of
anguish
said
you
must
let
me
look
at
him
they
faced
each
other
for
a
brief
instant
cyril
did
not
exist
for
constance
samuel
alone
obsessed
her
and
yet
samuel
seemed
a
strange
unknown
man
it
was
in
constance
life
one
of
those
crises
when
the
human
soul
seems
to
be
on
the
very
brink
of
mysterious
and
disconcerting
cognitions
and
then
the
wave
recedes
as
inexplicably
as
it
surged
up
why
of
course
said
povey
turning
away
lightly
as
though
to
imply
that
she
was
making
tragedies
out
of
nothing
she
gave
an
involuntary
gesture
of
almost
childish
relief
cyril
slept
calmly
it
was
a
triumph
for
povey
constance
could
not
sleep
as
she
lay
darkly
awake
by
her
husband
her
secret
being
seemed
to
be
with
emotion
not
exactly
sorrow
not
exactly
joy
an
emotion
more
elemental
than
these
a
sensation
of
the
intensity
of
her
life
in
that
hour
troubling
anxious
yet
not
sad
she
said
that
samuel
was
quite
right
quite
right
and
then
she
said
that
the
poor
little
thing
was
yet
five
years
old
and
that
it
was
monstrous
the
two
had
to
be
reconciled
and
they
never
could
be
reconciled
always
she
would
be
between
them
to
reconcile
them
and
to
be
crushed
by
their
impact
always
she
would
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
both
of
them
there
could
be
no
ease
for
her
no
surcease
from
a
tremendous
preoccupation
and
responsibility
she
could
not
change
samuel
besides
he
was
right
and
though
cyril
was
not
yet
five
she
felt
that
she
could
not
change
cyril
either
he
was
just
as
unchangeable
as
a
growing
plant
the
thought
of
her
mother
and
sophia
did
not
present
itself
to
her
she
felt
however
somewhat
as
baines
had
felt
on
historic
occasions
but
being
more
softly
kind
younger
and
less
chafed
by
destiny
she
was
conscious
of
no
bitterness
conscious
rather
of
a
solemn
blessedness
chapter
iv
crime
i
now
master
cyril
amy
protested
will
you
leave
that
fire
alone
it
not
you
that
can
mend
my
fires
a
boy
of
nine
great
and
heavy
for
his
years
with
a
full
face
and
very
short
hair
bent
over
the
smoking
grate
it
was
about
five
minutes
to
eight
on
a
chilly
morning
after
easter
amy
hastily
clad
in
blue
with
a
rough
brown
apron
was
setting
the
breakfast
table
the
boy
turned
his
head
still
bending
shut
up
ame
he
replied
smiling
life
being
short
he
usually
called
her
ame
when
they
were
alone
together
or
i
catch
you
one
in
the
eye
with
the
poker
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
said
amy
and
you
know
your
mother
told
you
to
wash
your
feet
this
morning
and
you
have
done
fine
clothes
is
all
very
well
but
who
says
i
have
washed
my
feet
asked
cyril
guiltily
amy
mention
of
fine
clothes
referred
to
the
fact
that
he
was
that
morning
wearing
his
sunday
suit
for
the
first
time
on
a
i
say
you
have
said
amy
she
was
more
than
three
times
his
age
still
but
they
had
been
treating
each
other
as
intellectual
equals
for
years
and
how
do
you
know
asked
cyril
tired
of
the
fire
i
know
said
amy
well
you
just
do
then
said
cyril
and
what
about
your
feet
i
should
be
sorry
to
see
your
feet
ame
amy
was
excusably
annoyed
she
tossed
her
head
my
feet
are
as
clean
as
yours
any
day
she
said
and
i
shall
tell
your
mother
but
he
would
not
leave
her
feet
alone
and
there
ensued
one
of
those
endless
monotonous
altercations
on
a
single
theme
which
occur
so
often
between
intellectual
equals
when
one
is
a
young
son
of
the
house
and
the
other
an
established
servant
who
adores
him
refined
minds
would
have
found
the
talk
disgusting
but
the
sentiment
of
disgust
seemed
to
be
unknown
to
either
of
the
wranglers
at
last
when
amy
by
superior
tactics
had
cornered
him
cyril
said
suddenly
oh
go
to
hell
amy
banged
down
the
spoon
for
the
bacon
gravy
now
i
shall
tell
your
mother
mark
my
words
this
time
i
shall
tell
your
mother
cyril
felt
that
in
truth
he
had
gone
rather
far
he
was
perfectly
sure
that
amy
would
not
tell
his
mother
and
yet
supposing
that
by
some
freak
of
her
nature
she
did
the
consequences
would
be
unutterable
the
consequences
would
more
than
extinguish
his
private
glory
in
the
use
of
such
a
dashing
word
so
he
laughed
a
rather
silly
giggling
laugh
to
reassure
himself
you
dare
he
said
dare
i
she
said
grimly
you
see
do
know
where
you
learn
it
fair
beats
me
but
it
is
amy
bates
as
is
going
to
be
sworn
at
as
soon
as
ever
your
mother
comes
into
this
room
the
door
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
creaked
and
constance
came
into
the
room
she
was
wearing
a
dress
of
majenta
merino
and
a
gold
chain
descended
from
her
neck
over
her
rich
bosom
she
had
scarcely
aged
in
five
years
it
would
have
been
surprising
if
she
had
altered
much
for
the
years
had
passed
over
her
head
at
an
incredible
rate
to
her
it
appeared
only
a
few
months
since
cyril
first
and
last
party
are
you
all
ready
my
pet
let
me
look
at
you
constance
greeted
the
boy
with
her
usual
bright
soft
energy
cyril
glanced
at
amy
who
averted
her
head
putting
spoons
into
three
saucers
yes
mother
he
replied
in
a
new
voice
did
you
do
what
i
told
you
yes
mother
he
said
simply
that
right
amy
made
a
faint
noise
with
her
lips
and
departed
he
was
saved
once
more
he
said
to
himself
that
never
again
would
he
permit
his
soul
to
be
disturbed
by
any
threat
of
old
ame
constance
hand
descended
into
her
pocket
and
drew
out
a
hard
paper
packet
which
she
clapped
on
to
her
son
head
oh
mother
he
pretended
that
she
had
hurt
him
and
then
he
opened
the
packet
it
contained
congleton
butterscotch
reputed
a
harmless
sweetmeat
good
he
cried
good
oh
thanks
mother
now
do
begin
eating
them
at
once
just
one
mother
no
and
how
often
have
i
told
you
to
keep
your
feet
off
that
fender
see
how
it
bent
and
it
nobody
but
you
sorry
it
no
use
being
sorry
if
you
persist
in
doing
it
oh
mother
i
had
such
a
funny
dream
they
chatted
until
amy
came
up
the
stairs
with
tea
and
bacon
the
fire
had
developed
from
black
to
clear
red
run
and
tell
father
that
breakfast
is
ready
after
a
little
delay
a
spectacled
man
of
fifty
short
and
stoutish
with
grey
hair
and
a
small
beard
half
grey
and
half
black
entered
from
the
shop
samuel
had
certainly
very
much
aged
especially
in
his
gestures
which
however
were
still
quick
he
sat
down
at
once
his
wife
and
son
were
already
seated
and
served
the
bacon
with
the
rapid
assurance
of
one
who
needs
not
to
inquire
about
tastes
and
appetites
not
a
word
was
said
except
a
brief
grace
by
samuel
but
there
was
no
restraint
samuel
had
a
mild
benignant
air
constance
eyes
were
a
fountain
of
cheerfulness
the
boy
sat
between
them
and
ate
steadily
mysterious
creature
this
child
mysteriously
growing
and
growing
in
the
house
to
his
mother
he
was
a
delicious
joy
at
all
times
save
when
he
disobeyed
his
father
but
now
for
quite
a
considerable
period
there
had
been
no
serious
collision
the
boy
seemed
to
be
acquiring
virtue
as
well
as
sense
and
really
he
was
charming
so
big
truly
enormous
every
one
remarked
on
it
and
yet
graceful
lithe
with
a
smile
that
could
ravish
and
he
was
distinguished
in
his
bearing
without
depreciating
samuel
in
her
faithful
heart
constance
saw
plainly
the
singular
differences
between
samuel
and
the
boy
save
that
he
was
dark
and
that
his
father
look
came
into
those
childish
eyes
occasionally
cyril
had
now
scarcely
any
obvious
resemblance
to
his
father
he
was
a
baines
this
naturally
deepened
constance
family
pride
yes
he
was
mysterious
to
constance
though
probably
not
more
so
than
any
other
boy
to
any
other
parent
he
was
equally
mysterious
to
samuel
but
otherwise
povey
had
learned
to
regard
him
in
the
light
of
a
parcel
which
he
was
always
attempting
to
wrap
up
in
a
piece
of
paper
imperceptibly
too
small
when
he
successfully
covered
the
parcel
at
one
corner
it
burst
out
at
another
and
this
went
on
for
ever
and
he
could
never
get
the
string
on
nevertheless
povey
had
unabated
confidence
in
his
skill
as
a
the
boy
was
strangely
subtle
at
times
but
then
at
times
he
was
astoundingly
ingenuous
and
then
his
dodges
would
not
deceive
the
dullest
povey
knew
himself
more
than
a
match
for
his
son
he
was
proud
of
him
because
he
regarded
him
as
not
an
ordinary
boy
he
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
his
boy
should
not
be
an
ordinary
boy
he
never
or
very
rarely
praised
cyril
cyril
thought
of
his
father
as
a
man
who
in
response
to
any
request
always
began
by
answering
with
a
thoughtful
serious
afraid
not
so
you
have
lost
your
appetite
his
mother
commented
cyril
grinned
did
you
expect
me
to
mother
let
me
see
said
samuel
as
if
vaguely
recalling
an
unimportant
fact
it
you
begin
to
go
to
school
is
it
i
wish
father
would
be
such
a
chump
cyril
reflected
and
considering
that
this
commencement
of
school
real
school
not
a
school
as
once
had
been
the
chief
topic
in
the
house
for
days
weeks
considering
that
it
now
occupied
and
filled
all
hearts
reflection
was
excusable
now
there
one
thing
you
must
always
remember
my
boy
said
povey
promptness
never
be
late
either
in
going
to
school
or
in
coming
home
and
in
order
that
you
may
have
no
excuse
povey
pressed
on
the
word
as
though
condemning
cyril
in
advance
here
something
for
you
he
said
the
last
words
quickly
with
a
sort
of
modest
shame
it
was
a
silver
watch
and
chain
cyril
was
staggered
so
also
was
constance
for
povey
could
keep
his
own
counsel
at
long
intervals
he
would
prove
thus
that
he
was
a
mighty
soul
capable
of
sublime
deeds
the
watch
was
the
unique
flowering
of
povey
profound
but
harsh
affection
it
lay
on
the
table
like
a
miracle
this
day
was
a
great
day
a
supremely
exciting
day
in
cyril
history
and
not
less
so
in
the
history
of
his
parents
the
watch
killed
its
owner
appetite
dead
routine
was
ignored
that
morning
father
did
not
go
back
into
the
shop
at
length
the
moment
came
when
father
put
on
his
hat
and
overcoat
to
take
cyril
and
cyril
watch
and
satchel
to
the
endowed
school
which
had
quarters
in
the
wedgwood
institution
close
by
a
solemn
departure
and
cyril
could
not
pretend
by
his
demeanour
that
it
was
not
constance
desired
to
kiss
him
but
refrained
he
would
not
have
liked
it
she
watched
them
from
the
window
cyril
was
nearly
as
tall
as
his
father
that
is
to
say
not
nearly
as
tall
but
creeping
up
his
shoulder
she
felt
that
the
eyes
of
the
town
must
be
on
the
pair
she
was
very
happy
and
nervous
at
a
triumph
seemed
probable
and
at
when
cyril
came
home
under
a
hat
and
with
a
satchel
full
of
new
books
and
a
head
full
of
new
ideas
the
triumph
was
actually
and
definitely
achieved
he
had
been
put
into
the
third
form
and
he
announced
that
he
should
soon
be
at
the
top
of
it
he
was
enchanted
with
the
life
of
school
he
liked
the
other
boys
and
it
appeared
that
the
other
boys
liked
him
the
fact
was
that
with
a
new
silver
watch
and
a
packet
of
sweets
he
had
begun
his
new
career
in
the
most
advantageous
circumstances
moreover
he
possessed
qualities
which
ensure
success
at
school
he
was
big
and
easy
with
a
captivating
smile
and
a
marked
aptitude
to
learn
those
things
which
boys
insist
on
teaching
to
their
new
comrades
he
had
muscle
a
brave
demeanour
and
no
conceit
during
tea
the
parlour
began
to
accustom
itself
to
a
new
vocabulary
containing
such
words
as
in
lines
to
some
of
these
words
the
parents
especially
povey
had
an
instinct
to
object
but
they
could
not
object
somehow
they
did
not
seem
to
get
an
opportunity
to
object
they
were
carried
away
on
the
torrent
and
after
all
their
excitement
and
pleasure
in
the
exceeding
romantic
novelty
of
existence
were
just
as
intense
and
nearly
as
ingenuous
as
their
son
he
demonstrated
that
unless
he
was
allowed
to
stay
up
later
than
aforetime
he
would
not
be
able
to
do
his
and
hence
would
not
keep
that
place
in
the
school
to
which
his
talents
entitled
him
povey
suggested
but
only
with
half
a
heart
that
he
should
get
up
earlier
in
the
morning
the
proposal
fell
flat
everybody
knew
and
admitted
that
nothing
save
the
scorpions
of
absolute
necessity
or
a
tremendous
occasion
such
as
that
particular
morning
would
drive
cyril
from
his
bed
until
the
smell
of
bacon
rose
to
him
from
the
kitchen
the
parlour
table
was
consecrated
to
his
lessons
it
became
generally
known
that
was
doing
his
lessons
his
father
scanned
the
new
while
cyril
condescendingly
explained
to
him
that
all
others
were
superseded
and
worthless
his
father
contrived
to
maintain
an
air
of
preserving
his
mental
equilibrium
but
not
his
mother
she
gave
it
up
she
who
till
that
day
had
under
his
direction
taught
him
nearly
all
that
he
knew
and
cyril
passed
above
her
into
regions
of
knowledge
where
she
made
no
pretence
of
being
able
to
follow
him
when
the
lessons
were
done
and
cyril
had
wiped
his
fingers
on
bits
of
and
his
father
had
expressed
qualified
approval
and
had
gone
into
the
shop
cyril
said
to
his
mother
with
that
delicious
hesitation
which
overtook
him
sometimes
mother
well
my
pet
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
well
what
is
it
no
you
must
promise
i
do
it
if
i
can
but
you
can
it
is
doing
it
not
doing
come
cyril
out
with
it
i
do
want
you
to
come
in
and
look
at
me
after
i
asleep
any
more
but
you
silly
boy
what
difference
can
it
make
to
you
if
asleep
i
do
want
you
to
it
like
as
if
i
was
a
baby
you
have
to
stop
doing
it
some
day
and
so
you
may
as
well
stop
now
it
was
thus
that
he
meant
to
turn
his
back
on
his
youth
she
smiled
she
was
incomprehensibly
happy
she
continued
to
smile
now
you
promise
wo
you
mother
she
rapped
him
on
the
head
with
her
thimble
lovingly
he
took
the
gesture
for
consent
you
are
a
baby
she
murmured
now
i
shall
trust
you
he
said
ignoring
this
say
bright
honour
bright
with
what
a
long
caress
her
eyes
followed
him
as
he
went
up
to
bed
on
his
great
sturdy
legs
she
was
thankful
that
school
had
not
contaminated
her
adorable
innocent
if
she
could
have
been
ame
for
hours
she
perhaps
would
not
have
hesitated
to
put
butter
into
his
mouth
lest
it
should
melt
povey
and
constance
talked
late
and
low
that
night
they
could
neither
of
them
sleep
they
had
little
desire
to
sleep
face
said
to
her
husband
i
always
stuck
up
for
that
boy
in
spite
of
your
severities
and
you
see
how
right
i
was
and
povey
face
said
you
see
now
the
brilliant
success
of
my
system
you
see
how
my
educational
theories
have
justified
themselves
never
been
to
a
school
before
except
that
wretched
little
dame
school
and
he
goes
practically
straight
to
the
top
of
the
third
form
at
nine
years
of
age
they
discussed
his
future
there
could
be
no
sign
of
lunacy
in
discussing
his
future
up
to
a
certain
point
but
each
felt
that
to
discuss
the
ultimate
career
of
a
child
nine
years
old
would
not
be
the
act
of
a
sensible
parent
only
foolish
parents
would
be
so
fond
yet
each
was
dying
to
discuss
his
ultimate
career
constance
yielded
first
to
the
temptation
as
became
her
povey
scoffed
and
then
to
humour
constance
yielded
also
the
matter
was
soon
fairly
on
the
carpet
constance
was
relieved
to
find
that
povey
had
no
thought
whatever
of
putting
cyril
in
the
shop
no
povey
did
not
desire
to
chop
wood
with
a
razor
their
son
must
and
would
ascend
doctor
solicitor
barrister
not
barrister
barrister
was
fantastic
when
they
had
argued
for
about
half
an
hour
povey
intimated
suddenly
that
the
conversation
was
unworthy
of
their
practical
commonsense
and
went
to
sleep
ii
nobody
really
thought
that
this
almost
ideal
condition
of
things
would
persist
an
enterprise
commenced
in
such
glory
must
surely
traverse
periods
of
difficulty
and
even
of
temporary
disaster
but
no
cyril
seemed
to
be
made
specially
for
school
before
povey
and
constance
had
quite
accustomed
themselves
to
being
the
parents
of
great
lad
before
cyril
had
broken
the
glass
of
his
miraculous
watch
more
than
once
the
summer
term
had
come
to
an
end
and
there
arrived
the
excitations
of
the
as
it
was
called
for
at
that
epoch
the
smaller
schools
had
not
found
the
effrontery
to
dub
the
ceremony
a
this
furnished
a
particular
joy
to
and
povey
although
the
prizes
were
notoriously
few
in
number
partly
to
add
to
their
significance
and
partly
to
diminish
their
cost
the
foundation
was
poor
cyril
won
a
prize
a
box
of
geometrical
instruments
of
precision
also
he
reached
the
top
of
his
form
and
was
marked
for
promotion
to
the
formidable
fourth
samuel
and
constance
were
bidden
to
the
large
hall
of
the
wedgwood
institution
of
a
summer
afternoon
and
they
saw
the
whole
board
of
governors
raised
on
a
rostrum
and
in
the
middle
in
front
of
what
he
referred
to
in
his
aristocratic
london
accent
as
beggarly
array
of
rewards
the
aged
and
celebrated
sir
thomas
wilbraham
wilbraham
last
respectable
member
of
his
ancient
line
and
sir
thomas
gave
the
box
of
instruments
to
cyril
and
shook
hands
with
him
and
everybody
was
very
well
dressed
samuel
who
had
never
attended
anything
but
a
national
school
recalled
the
simple
rigours
of
his
own
boyhood
and
swelled
for
certainly
of
all
the
parents
present
he
was
among
the
richest
when
in
the
informal
promiscuities
which
followed
the
prize
distribution
cyril
joined
his
father
and
mother
sheepishly
they
duly
did
their
best
to
make
light
of
his
achievements
and
failed
the
walls
of
the
hall
were
covered
with
specimens
of
the
pupils
skill
and
the
headmaster
was
observed
to
direct
the
attention
of
the
mighty
to
a
map
done
by
cyril
of
course
it
was
a
map
of
ireland
ireland
being
the
map
chosen
by
every
schoolboy
who
is
free
to
choose
for
a
boy
it
was
considered
a
masterpiece
in
the
shading
of
mountains
cyril
was
already
a
prodigy
never
it
was
said
had
the
macgillycuddy
reeks
been
indicated
by
a
member
of
that
school
with
a
more
amazing
subtle
refinement
than
by
the
young
povey
from
a
proper
pride
in
themselves
from
a
proper
fear
lest
they
should
be
secretly
accused
of
ostentation
by
other
parents
samuel
and
constance
did
not
go
near
that
map
for
the
rest
they
had
lived
with
it
for
weeks
and
samuel
who
after
all
was
determined
not
to
be
dirt
under
his
feet
had
scratched
a
blot
from
it
with
a
completeness
that
defied
inquisitive
examination
the
fame
of
this
map
added
to
the
box
of
compasses
and
cyril
own
desire
pointed
to
an
artistic
career
cyril
had
always
drawn
and
daubed
and
the
of
the
endowed
school
who
was
also
headmaster
of
the
art
school
had
suggested
that
the
youth
should
attend
the
art
school
one
night
a
week
samuel
however
would
not
listen
to
the
idea
cyril
was
too
young
it
is
true
that
cyril
was
too
young
but
samuel
real
objection
was
to
cyril
going
out
alone
in
the
evening
on
that
he
was
adamant
the
governors
had
recently
made
the
discovery
that
a
sports
department
was
necessary
to
a
good
school
and
had
rented
a
field
for
cricket
football
and
rounders
up
at
bleakridge
an
innovation
which
demonstrated
that
the
town
was
moving
with
the
rapid
times
in
june
this
field
was
open
after
school
hours
till
eight
as
well
as
on
saturdays
the
squire
learnt
that
cyril
had
a
talent
for
cricket
and
cyril
wished
to
practise
in
the
evenings
and
was
quite
ready
to
bind
himself
with
bible
oaths
to
rise
at
no
matter
what
hour
in
the
morning
for
the
purpose
of
home
lessons
he
scarcely
expected
his
father
to
say
as
his
father
never
did
say
but
he
was
obliged
to
ask
samuel
nonplussed
him
by
replying
that
on
fine
evenings
when
he
could
spare
time
from
the
shop
he
would
go
up
to
bleakridge
with
his
son
cyril
did
not
like
this
in
the
least
still
it
might
be
tried
one
evening
they
went
actually
in
the
new
which
had
superseded
the
old
and
which
travelled
all
the
way
to
longshaw
a
place
that
cyril
had
only
heard
of
samuel
talked
of
the
games
played
in
the
five
towns
in
his
day
of
the
titanic
sport
of
when
the
team
of
one
went
forth
to
the
challenge
of
another
preceded
by
a
band
and
when
in
the
heat
of
the
chase
a
man
might
jump
into
the
canal
to
escape
his
pursuer
samuel
had
never
played
at
cricket
samuel
with
a
very
young
grandson
of
fan
deceased
sat
in
dignity
on
the
grass
and
watched
his
cricketer
for
an
hour
and
a
half
while
constance
kept
an
eye
on
the
shop
and
superintended
its
closing
samuel
then
conducted
cyril
home
again
two
days
later
the
father
of
his
own
accord
offered
to
repeat
the
experience
cyril
refused
disagreeable
insinuations
that
he
was
a
baby
in
arms
had
been
made
at
school
in
the
meantime
nevertheless
in
other
directions
cyril
sometimes
surprisingly
conquered
for
instance
he
came
home
one
day
with
the
information
that
a
dog
that
was
not
a
was
not
worth
calling
a
dog
grandson
had
been
carried
off
in
earliest
prime
by
a
that
had
pierced
his
vitals
and
cyril
did
indeed
persuade
his
father
to
buy
a
the
animal
was
a
superlative
of
forbidding
ugliness
but
father
and
son
vied
with
each
other
in
stern
critical
praise
of
his
surpassing
beauty
and
constance
from
good
nature
joined
in
the
pretence
he
was
called
lion
and
the
shop
after
one
or
two
untoward
episodes
was
absolutely
closed
to
him
but
the
most
striking
of
cyril
successes
had
to
do
with
the
question
of
the
annual
holiday
he
spoke
of
the
sea
soon
after
becoming
a
schoolboy
it
appeared
that
his
complete
ignorance
of
the
sea
prejudicially
affected
him
at
school
further
he
had
always
loved
the
sea
he
had
drawn
hundreds
of
ships
with
set
and
knew
the
difference
between
a
brig
and
a
brigantine
when
he
first
said
i
say
mother
why
ca
we
go
to
llandudno
instead
of
buxton
this
year
his
mother
thought
he
was
out
of
his
senses
for
the
idea
of
going
to
any
place
other
than
buxton
was
inconceivable
had
they
not
always
been
to
buxton
what
would
their
landlady
say
how
could
they
ever
look
her
in
the
face
again
besides
well
they
went
to
llandudno
rather
scared
and
hardly
knowing
how
the
change
had
come
about
but
they
went
and
it
was
the
force
of
cyril
will
cyril
the
theoretic
cypher
that
took
them
iii
the
removal
of
the
endowed
school
to
more
commodious
premises
in
the
shape
of
shawport
hall
an
ancient
mansion
with
fifty
rooms
and
five
acres
of
land
round
about
it
was
not
a
change
that
quite
pleased
samuel
or
constance
they
admitted
the
hygienic
advantages
but
shawport
hall
was
of
a
mile
distant
from
square
in
the
hollow
that
separates
bursley
from
its
suburb
of
hillport
whereas
the
wedgwood
institution
was
scarcely
a
minute
away
it
was
as
if
cyril
when
he
set
off
to
shawport
hall
of
a
morning
passed
out
of
their
sphere
of
influence
he
was
leagues
off
doing
they
knew
not
what
further
his
was
cut
short
by
the
extra
time
needed
for
the
journey
to
and
fro
and
he
arrived
late
for
tea
it
may
be
said
that
he
often
arrived
very
late
for
tea
the
whole
machinery
of
the
meal
was
disturbed
these
matters
seemed
to
samuel
and
constance
to
be
of
tremendous
import
seemed
to
threaten
the
very
foundations
of
existence
then
they
grew
accustomed
to
the
new
order
and
wondered
sometimes
when
they
passed
the
wedgwood
institution
and
the
insalubrious
cock
yard
once
sole
playground
of
the
boys
that
the
school
could
ever
have
in
the
narrow
quarters
once
allotted
to
it
cyril
though
constantly
successful
at
school
a
rising
man
an
infallible
of
excellent
reports
and
a
regular
taker
of
prizes
became
gradually
less
satisfactory
in
the
house
he
was
in
occasionally
and
although
his
father
pretended
to
hold
that
to
be
kept
in
was
to
slur
the
honour
of
a
spotless
family
cyril
continued
to
be
kept
in
a
hardened
sinner
lost
to
shame
but
this
was
not
the
worst
the
worst
undoubtedly
was
that
cyril
was
rough
no
definite
accusation
could
be
laid
against
him
the
offence
was
general
vague
everlasting
it
was
in
all
he
did
and
said
in
every
gesture
and
movement
he
shouted
whistled
sang
stamped
stumbled
lunged
he
omitted
such
empty
rites
as
saying
or
and
wiping
his
nose
he
replied
gruffly
and
nonchalantly
to
polite
questions
or
he
did
reply
until
the
questions
were
repeated
and
even
then
with
a
air
that
was
not
genuine
his
shoelaces
were
a
sad
sight
and
his
no
sight
at
all
for
a
decent
woman
his
hair
was
as
rough
as
his
conduct
hardly
at
the
pistol
point
could
he
be
forced
to
put
oil
on
it
in
brief
he
was
no
longer
the
nice
boy
that
he
used
to
be
he
had
unmistakably
deteriorated
grievous
but
what
can
you
expect
when
your
boy
is
obliged
month
after
month
and
year
after
year
to
associate
with
other
boys
after
all
he
was
a
good
boy
said
constance
often
to
herself
and
now
and
then
to
samuel
for
constance
his
charm
was
eternally
renewed
his
smile
his
frequent
ingenuousness
his
funny
gesture
when
he
wanted
to
her
these
characteristics
remained
and
his
pure
heart
remained
she
could
read
that
in
his
eyes
samuel
was
inimical
to
his
tastes
for
sports
and
his
triumphs
therein
but
constance
had
pride
in
all
that
she
liked
to
feel
him
and
to
gaze
at
him
and
to
smell
that
faint
uncleanly
odour
of
sweat
that
hung
in
his
clothes
in
this
condition
he
reached
the
advanced
age
of
thirteen
and
his
parents
who
despite
their
notion
of
themselves
as
parents
were
a
simple
pair
never
suspected
that
his
heart
conceived
to
be
still
pure
had
become
a
crawling
horrible
mass
of
corruption
one
day
the
called
at
the
shop
now
to
see
a
walking
about
the
town
during
is
a
startling
spectacle
and
is
apt
to
give
you
the
same
uncanny
sensation
as
when
alone
in
a
room
you
think
you
see
something
move
which
ought
not
to
move
povey
was
startled
povey
had
a
thumping
within
his
breast
as
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
drew
the
to
the
private
corner
where
his
desk
was
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
almost
said
to
the
but
he
did
not
say
it
the
boot
was
emphatically
not
on
that
leg
the
talked
to
povey
in
tones
carefully
low
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
he
closed
the
interview
povey
escorted
him
across
the
shop
and
the
said
with
ordinary
loudness
of
course
it
nothing
but
my
experience
is
that
it
just
as
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
i
thought
i
tell
you
forewarned
is
forearmed
i
have
other
parents
to
see
they
shook
hands
at
the
door
then
povey
stepped
out
on
to
the
pavement
and
in
front
of
the
whole
square
detained
an
unwilling
for
quite
another
minute
his
face
was
deeply
flushed
as
he
returned
into
the
shop
the
assistants
bent
closer
over
their
work
he
did
not
instantly
rush
into
the
parlour
and
communicate
with
constance
he
had
dropped
into
a
way
of
conducting
many
operations
by
his
own
unaided
brain
his
confidence
in
his
skill
had
increased
with
years
further
at
the
back
of
his
mind
there
had
established
itself
a
vision
of
povey
as
the
seat
of
government
and
of
constance
and
cyril
as
a
sort
of
permanent
opposition
he
would
not
have
admitted
that
he
saw
such
a
vision
for
he
was
utterly
loyal
to
his
wife
but
it
was
there
this
unconfessed
vision
was
one
of
several
causes
which
had
contributed
to
intensify
his
inherent
tendency
towards
machiavellianism
and
secretiveness
he
said
nothing
to
constance
nothing
to
cyril
but
happening
to
encounter
amy
in
the
showroom
he
was
inspired
to
interrogate
her
sharply
the
result
was
that
they
descended
to
the
cellar
together
amy
weeping
amy
was
commanded
to
hold
her
tongue
and
as
she
went
in
mortal
fear
of
povey
she
did
hold
her
tongue
nothing
occurred
for
several
days
and
then
one
morning
it
was
constance
birthday
children
are
nearly
always
horribly
unlucky
in
their
choice
of
days
for
sin
povey
having
executed
mysterious
movements
in
the
shop
after
cyril
departure
to
school
jammed
his
hat
on
his
head
and
ran
forth
in
pursuit
of
cyril
whom
he
intercepted
with
two
other
boys
at
the
corner
of
oldcastle
street
and
acre
passage
cyril
stood
as
if
turned
into
salt
come
back
home
said
povey
grimly
and
for
the
sake
of
the
other
boys
please
but
i
shall
be
late
for
school
father
cyril
weakly
urged
never
mind
they
passed
through
the
shop
together
causing
a
terrific
concealed
emotion
and
then
they
did
violence
to
constance
by
appearing
in
the
parlour
constance
was
engaged
in
cutting
straws
and
ribbons
to
make
a
for
a
drawing
of
a
which
her
son
had
given
her
as
a
birthday
present
why
what
she
exclaimed
she
said
no
more
at
the
moment
because
she
was
sure
from
the
faces
of
her
men
that
the
time
was
big
with
fearful
events
take
your
satchel
off
povey
ordered
coldly
and
your
he
added
with
a
peculiar
intonation
as
if
glad
thus
to
prove
that
cyril
was
one
of
those
rude
boys
who
have
to
be
told
to
take
their
hats
off
in
a
room
whatever
amiss
constance
murmured
under
her
breath
as
cyril
obeyed
the
command
whatever
amiss
povey
made
no
immediate
answer
he
was
in
charge
of
these
proceedings
and
was
very
anxious
to
conduct
them
with
dignity
and
with
complete
effectiveness
little
fat
man
over
fifty
with
a
wizened
face
and
he
was
as
nervous
as
a
youth
his
heart
beat
furiously
and
constance
the
portly
matron
who
would
never
see
forty
again
was
just
as
nervous
as
a
girl
cyril
had
gone
very
white
all
three
felt
physically
sick
what
money
have
you
got
in
your
pockets
povey
demanded
as
a
commencement
cyril
who
had
had
no
opportunity
to
prepare
his
case
offered
no
reply
you
heard
what
i
said
povey
thundered
i
got
cyril
murmured
glumly
looking
down
at
the
floor
his
lower
lip
seemed
to
hang
precariously
away
from
his
gums
where
did
you
get
that
from
it
part
of
what
mother
gave
me
said
the
boy
i
did
give
him
a
threepenny
bit
last
week
constance
put
in
guiltily
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
had
any
money
if
you
gave
it
him
that
enough
said
povey
quickly
and
to
the
boy
that
all
you
got
yes
father
said
the
boy
you
sure
yes
father
cyril
was
playing
a
hazardous
game
for
the
highest
stakes
and
under
grave
disadvantages
and
he
acted
for
the
best
he
guarded
his
own
interests
as
well
as
he
could
povey
found
himself
obliged
to
take
a
serious
risk
empty
your
pockets
then
cyril
perceiving
that
he
had
lost
that
particular
game
emptied
his
pockets
cyril
said
constance
how
often
have
i
told
you
to
change
your
handkerchiefs
oftener
just
look
at
this
astonishing
creature
she
was
in
the
seventh
hell
of
sick
apprehension
and
yet
she
said
that
after
the
handkerchief
emerged
the
common
schoolboy
stock
of
articles
useful
and
magic
and
then
last
a
silver
florin
povey
felt
relief
oh
cyril
whimpered
constance
give
it
your
mother
said
povey
the
boy
stepped
forward
awkwardly
and
constance
weeping
took
the
coin
please
look
at
it
mother
said
povey
and
tell
me
if
there
a
cross
marked
on
it
constance
tears
blurred
the
coin
she
had
to
wipe
her
eyes
yes
she
whispered
faintly
there
something
on
it
i
thought
so
said
povey
where
did
you
steal
it
from
he
demanded
out
of
the
till
answered
cyril
have
you
ever
stolen
anything
out
of
the
till
before
yes
yes
what
yes
father
take
your
hands
out
of
your
pockets
and
stand
up
straight
if
you
can
how
often
i
i
do
know
father
i
blame
myself
said
povey
frankly
i
blame
myself
the
till
ought
always
to
be
locked
all
tills
ought
always
to
be
locked
but
we
felt
we
could
trust
the
assistants
if
anybody
had
told
me
that
i
ought
not
to
trust
you
if
anybody
had
told
me
that
my
own
son
would
be
the
thief
i
should
have
well
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
said
povey
was
quite
justified
in
blaming
himself
the
fact
was
that
the
functioning
of
that
till
was
a
patriarchal
survival
which
he
ought
to
have
revolutionized
but
which
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
revolutionize
so
accustomed
to
it
was
he
in
the
time
of
john
baines
the
till
with
its
three
bowls
two
for
silver
and
one
for
copper
gold
had
never
been
put
into
it
was
invariably
unlocked
the
person
in
charge
of
the
shop
took
change
from
it
for
the
assistants
or
temporarily
authorized
an
assistant
to
do
so
gold
was
kept
in
a
small
linen
bag
in
a
locked
drawer
of
the
desk
the
contents
of
the
till
were
never
checked
by
any
system
of
as
there
was
no
system
of
when
all
transactions
whether
in
payment
or
receipt
are
in
cash
the
baineses
never
owed
a
penny
save
the
quarterly
wholesale
accounts
which
were
discharged
instantly
to
the
travellers
a
system
of
is
not
indispensable
the
till
was
situate
immediately
at
the
entrance
to
the
shop
from
the
house
it
was
in
the
darkest
part
of
the
shop
and
the
unfortunate
cyril
had
to
pass
it
every
day
on
his
way
to
school
the
thing
was
a
perfect
device
for
the
manufacture
of
young
criminals
and
how
have
you
been
spending
this
money
povey
inquired
cyril
hands
slipped
into
his
pockets
again
then
noticing
the
lapse
he
dragged
them
out
sweets
said
he
anything
else
sweets
and
things
oh
said
povey
well
now
you
can
go
down
into
the
and
bring
up
here
all
the
things
there
are
in
that
little
box
in
the
corner
off
you
go
and
off
went
cyril
he
had
to
swagger
through
the
kitchen
what
did
i
tell
you
master
cyril
amy
unwisely
asked
of
him
copped
it
finely
this
time
was
a
word
which
she
had
learned
from
cyril
go
on
you
old
bitch
cyril
growled
as
he
returned
from
the
cellar
amy
said
angrily
i
told
you
i
should
tell
your
father
the
next
time
you
called
me
that
and
i
shall
you
mark
my
words
cant
cant
he
retorted
do
you
think
i
do
know
who
been
canting
cant
cant
upstairs
in
the
parlour
samuel
was
explaining
the
matter
to
his
wife
there
had
been
a
perfect
epidemic
of
smoking
in
the
school
the
had
discovered
it
and
he
hoped
stamped
it
out
what
had
disturbed
the
far
more
than
the
smoking
was
the
fact
that
a
few
boys
had
been
found
to
possess
somewhat
costly
pipes
or
the
wily
had
not
confiscated
these
articles
he
had
merely
informed
the
parents
concerned
in
his
opinion
the
articles
came
from
one
single
source
a
generous
thief
he
left
the
parents
to
ascertain
which
of
them
had
brought
a
thief
into
the
world
further
information
povey
had
culled
from
amy
and
there
could
remain
no
doubt
that
cyril
had
been
providing
his
chums
with
the
utensils
of
smoking
the
till
supplying
the
means
he
had
told
amy
that
the
things
which
he
secreted
in
the
cellar
had
been
presented
to
him
by
but
povey
did
not
believe
that
anyhow
he
had
marked
every
silver
coin
in
the
till
for
three
nights
and
had
watched
the
till
in
the
mornings
from
behind
the
and
the
florin
on
the
spoke
of
his
success
as
a
detective
constance
felt
guilty
on
behalf
of
cyril
as
povey
outlined
his
case
she
could
not
free
herself
from
an
entirely
irrational
sensation
of
sin
at
any
rate
of
special
responsibility
cyril
seemed
to
be
her
boy
and
not
samuel
boy
at
all
she
avoided
her
husband
glance
this
was
very
odd
then
cyril
returned
and
his
parents
composed
their
faces
and
he
deposited
next
to
the
florin
a
sham
meerschaum
pipe
in
a
case
a
a
cigar
of
which
one
end
had
been
charred
but
the
other
not
cut
and
a
packet
of
cigarettes
without
a
label
nothing
could
be
hid
from
povey
the
details
were
distressing
so
cyril
is
a
liar
and
a
thief
to
say
nothing
of
this
smoking
povey
concluded
he
spoke
as
if
cyril
had
invented
strange
and
monstrous
sins
but
deep
down
in
his
heart
a
little
voice
was
telling
him
as
regards
the
smoking
that
he
had
set
the
example
baines
had
never
smoked
critchlow
never
smoked
only
men
like
daniel
smoked
thus
far
povey
had
conducted
the
proceedings
to
his
own
satisfaction
he
had
proved
the
crime
he
had
made
cyril
confess
the
whole
affair
lay
revealed
well
what
next
cyril
ought
to
have
dissolved
in
repentance
something
dramatic
ought
to
have
occurred
but
cyril
simply
stood
with
hanging
sulky
head
and
gave
no
sign
of
proper
feeling
povey
considered
that
until
something
did
happen
he
must
improve
the
occasion
here
we
have
trade
getting
worse
every
day
said
he
it
was
true
and
you
are
robbing
your
parents
to
make
a
beast
of
yourself
and
corrupting
your
companions
i
wonder
your
mother
never
smelt
you
i
never
dreamt
of
such
a
thing
said
constance
grievously
besides
a
young
man
clever
enough
to
rob
a
till
is
usually
clever
enough
to
find
out
that
the
secret
of
safety
in
smoking
is
to
use
cachous
and
not
to
keep
the
stuff
in
your
pockets
a
minute
longer
than
you
can
help
there
no
knowing
how
much
money
you
have
stolen
said
povey
a
thief
if
cyril
had
stolen
cakes
jam
string
cigars
povey
would
never
have
said
as
he
did
say
it
but
money
money
was
different
and
a
till
was
not
a
cupboard
or
a
larder
a
till
was
a
till
cyril
had
struck
at
the
very
basis
of
society
and
on
your
mother
birthday
povey
said
further
there
one
thing
i
can
do
he
said
i
can
burn
all
this
built
on
lies
how
dared
you
and
he
pitched
into
the
fire
not
the
apparatus
of
crime
but
the
drawing
of
a
and
the
straws
and
the
blue
ribbon
for
bows
at
the
corners
how
dared
you
he
repeated
you
never
gave
me
any
money
cyril
muttered
he
thought
the
marking
of
coins
a
mean
trick
and
the
of
bad
trade
and
his
mother
birthday
roused
a
familiar
devil
that
usually
slept
quietly
in
his
breast
what
that
you
say
povey
almost
shouted
you
never
gave
me
any
money
the
devil
repeated
in
a
louder
tone
than
cyril
had
employed
it
was
true
but
cyril
only
to
ask
and
he
would
have
received
all
that
was
good
for
him
povey
sprang
up
povey
also
had
a
devil
the
two
devils
gazed
at
each
other
for
an
instant
and
then
noticing
that
cyril
head
was
above
povey
the
elder
devil
controlled
itself
povey
had
suddenly
had
as
much
drama
as
he
wanted
get
away
to
bed
said
he
with
dignity
cyril
went
defiantly
he
to
have
nothing
but
bread
and
water
mother
povey
finished
he
was
on
the
whole
pleased
with
himself
later
in
the
day
constance
reported
tearfully
that
she
had
been
up
to
cyril
and
that
cyril
had
wept
which
was
to
cyril
credit
but
all
felt
that
life
could
never
be
the
same
again
during
the
remainder
of
existence
this
unspeakable
horror
would
lift
its
obscene
form
between
them
constance
had
never
been
so
unhappy
occasionally
when
by
herself
she
would
rebel
for
a
brief
moment
as
one
rebels
in
secret
against
a
mummery
which
one
is
obliged
to
treat
seriously
after
all
she
would
whisper
suppose
he
has
taken
a
few
shillings
out
of
the
till
what
then
what
does
it
matter
but
these
moods
of
moral
insurrection
against
society
and
povey
were
very
transitory
they
were
come
and
gone
in
a
flash
chapter
v
another
crime
i
one
night
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
year
about
six
months
after
the
tragedy
of
the
florin
samuel
povey
was
wakened
up
by
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
a
voice
that
whispered
father
the
thief
and
the
liar
was
standing
in
his
by
the
bed
samuel
sleepy
eyes
could
just
descry
him
in
the
thick
gloom
what
what
questioned
the
father
gradually
coming
to
consciousness
what
are
you
doing
there
i
did
want
to
wake
mother
up
the
boy
whispered
there
someone
been
throwing
dirt
or
something
at
our
windows
and
has
been
for
a
long
time
eh
what
samuel
stared
at
the
dim
form
of
the
thief
and
liar
the
boy
was
tall
not
in
the
least
like
a
little
boy
and
yet
then
he
seemed
to
his
father
as
quite
a
little
boy
a
little
in
a
with
childish
gestures
and
childish
inflections
and
a
childish
delicious
quaint
anxiety
not
to
disturb
his
mother
who
had
lately
been
deprived
of
sleep
owing
to
an
illness
of
amy
which
had
demanded
nursing
his
father
had
not
so
perceived
him
for
years
in
that
instant
the
conviction
that
cyril
was
permanently
unfit
for
human
society
finally
expired
in
the
father
mind
time
had
already
weakened
it
very
considerably
the
decision
that
be
cyril
what
he
might
the
summer
holiday
must
be
taken
as
usual
had
dealt
it
a
fearful
blow
and
yet
though
samuel
and
constance
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
the
companionship
of
a
criminal
that
they
frequently
lost
memory
of
his
guilt
for
long
periods
nevertheless
the
convention
of
his
leprosy
had
more
or
less
persisted
with
samuel
until
that
moment
when
it
vanished
with
strange
suddenness
to
samuel
conscious
relief
there
was
a
rain
of
pellets
on
the
window
hear
that
demanded
cyril
whispering
dramatically
and
it
been
like
that
on
my
window
too
samuel
arose
go
back
to
your
room
he
ordered
in
the
same
dramatic
whisper
but
not
as
father
to
son
rather
as
conspirator
to
conspirator
constance
slept
they
could
hear
her
regular
breathing
barefooted
the
elderly
gowned
figure
followed
the
younger
and
one
after
the
other
they
creaked
down
the
two
steps
which
separated
room
from
his
parents
shut
the
door
quietly
said
samuel
cyril
obeyed
and
then
having
lighted
cyril
gas
samuel
drew
the
blind
unfastened
the
catch
of
the
window
and
began
to
open
it
with
many
precautions
of
silence
all
the
sashes
in
that
house
were
difficult
to
manage
cyril
stood
close
to
his
father
shivering
without
knowing
that
he
shivered
astonished
only
that
his
father
had
not
told
him
to
get
back
into
bed
at
once
it
was
beyond
doubt
the
proudest
hour
of
cyril
career
in
addition
to
the
mysterious
circumstances
of
the
night
there
was
in
the
situation
that
thrill
which
always
communicates
itself
to
a
father
and
son
when
they
are
afoot
together
upon
an
enterprise
unsuspected
by
the
woman
from
whom
their
lives
have
no
secrets
samuel
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
a
man
was
standing
there
that
you
samuel
the
voice
came
low
yes
replied
samuel
cautiously
it
not
cousin
daniel
is
it
i
want
ye
said
daniel
povey
curtly
samuel
paused
i
be
down
in
a
minute
he
said
cyril
at
length
received
the
command
to
get
back
into
bed
at
once
whatever
up
father
he
asked
joyously
i
do
know
i
must
put
some
things
on
and
go
and
see
he
shut
down
the
window
on
all
the
breezes
that
were
pouring
into
the
room
now
quick
before
i
turn
the
gas
out
he
admonished
his
hand
on
the
you
tell
me
in
the
morning
wo
you
father
yes
said
povey
conquering
his
habitual
impulse
to
say
he
crept
back
to
the
large
bedroom
to
grope
for
clothes
when
having
descended
to
the
parlour
and
lighted
the
gas
there
he
opened
the
expecting
to
let
cousin
daniel
in
there
was
no
sign
of
cousin
daniel
presently
he
saw
a
figure
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
square
he
whistled
samuel
had
a
singular
faculty
of
whistling
the
envy
of
his
son
and
daniel
beckoned
to
him
he
nearly
extinguished
the
gas
and
then
ran
out
hatless
he
was
wearing
most
of
his
clothes
except
his
linen
collar
and
necktie
and
the
collar
of
his
coat
was
turned
up
daniel
advanced
before
him
without
waiting
into
the
shop
opposite
being
part
of
the
most
modern
building
in
the
square
daniel
shop
was
provided
with
the
new
iron
shutter
by
means
of
which
you
closed
your
establishment
with
a
motion
similar
to
the
winding
of
a
large
clock
instead
of
putting
up
twenty
separate
shutters
one
by
one
as
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
little
portal
in
the
vast
sheet
of
armour
was
ajar
and
daniel
had
passed
into
the
gloom
beyond
at
the
same
moment
a
policeman
came
along
on
his
beat
cutting
off
povey
from
daniel
officer
brrr
said
povey
gathering
his
dignity
about
him
and
holding
himself
as
though
it
was
part
of
his
normal
habit
to
take
exercise
bareheaded
and
collarless
in
luke
square
on
cold
november
nights
he
behaved
so
because
if
daniel
had
desired
the
services
of
a
policeman
daniel
would
of
course
have
spoken
to
this
one
goo
night
sir
said
the
policeman
after
recognizing
him
what
time
is
it
asked
samuel
bold
a
one
sir
the
policeman
leaving
samuel
at
the
little
open
door
went
forward
across
the
lamplit
square
and
samuel
entered
his
cousin
shop
daniel
povey
was
standing
behind
the
door
and
as
samuel
came
in
he
shut
the
door
with
a
startling
sudden
movement
save
for
the
twinkle
of
gas
the
shop
was
in
darkness
it
had
the
empty
appearance
which
a
confectioner
and
baker
always
has
at
night
the
large
brass
scales
near
the
glinted
and
the
glass
with
scarce
a
tart
among
them
also
caught
the
faint
flare
of
the
gas
what
the
matter
daniel
anything
wrong
samuel
asked
feeling
boyish
as
he
usually
did
in
the
presence
of
daniel
the
man
seized
him
with
one
hand
by
the
shoulder
in
a
grip
that
convicted
samuel
of
frailty
look
here
said
he
in
his
low
pleasant
voice
somewhat
altered
by
excitement
you
know
as
my
wife
drinks
he
stared
defiantly
at
samuel
n
no
said
samuel
that
is
no
one
ever
said
this
was
true
he
did
not
know
that
daniel
povey
at
the
age
of
fifty
had
definitely
taken
to
drink
there
had
been
rumours
that
she
enjoyed
a
glass
with
too
much
gusto
but
meant
more
than
that
she
drinks
daniel
povey
continued
and
has
done
this
last
two
year
i
very
sorry
to
hear
it
said
samuel
tremendously
shocked
by
this
brutal
rending
of
the
cloak
of
decency
always
everybody
had
feigned
to
daniel
and
daniel
had
feigned
to
everybody
that
his
wife
was
as
other
wives
and
now
the
man
himself
had
torn
to
pieces
in
a
moment
the
veil
of
thirty
years
weaving
and
if
that
was
the
worst
daniel
murmured
reflectively
loosening
his
grip
samuel
was
excessively
disturbed
his
cousin
was
hinting
at
matters
which
he
himself
at
any
rate
had
never
hinted
at
even
to
constance
so
abhorrent
were
they
matters
unutterable
which
hung
like
clouds
in
the
social
atmosphere
of
the
town
and
of
which
at
rare
intervals
one
conveyed
one
cognizance
not
by
words
but
by
something
scarce
perceptible
in
a
glance
an
accent
not
often
is
a
town
such
as
bursley
starred
with
such
a
woman
as
daniel
povey
but
what
wrong
samuel
asked
trying
to
be
firm
and
what
is
wrong
he
asked
himself
what
does
all
this
mean
at
after
one
in
the
morning
look
here
daniel
recommenced
seizing
his
shoulder
again
i
went
to
liverpool
corn
market
and
missed
the
last
train
so
i
came
by
mail
from
crewe
and
what
do
i
find
i
find
dick
sitting
on
the
stairs
in
the
dark
pretty
high
naked
sitting
on
the
stairs
dick
ay
this
is
what
i
come
home
to
but
hold
on
he
been
in
bed
a
couple
of
days
with
a
feverish
cold
caught
through
lying
in
damp
sheets
as
his
mother
had
forgot
to
air
she
brings
him
no
supper
he
calls
out
no
answer
then
he
gets
up
to
go
and
see
what
happened
and
he
slips
on
stairs
and
breaks
his
knee
or
puts
it
out
or
summat
sat
there
hours
seemingly
could
walk
neither
up
nor
down
and
was
your
wife
was
dead
drunk
in
the
parlour
but
the
servant
servant
daniel
povey
laughed
we
ca
keep
our
servants
they
wo
stay
you
know
that
he
did
daniel
povey
domestic
methods
and
idiosyncrasies
could
at
any
rate
be
freely
discussed
and
they
were
and
what
have
you
done
done
why
i
picked
him
up
in
my
arms
and
carried
him
upstairs
again
and
a
fine
job
i
had
too
here
come
here
daniel
strode
impulsively
across
the
shop
the
counterflap
was
up
and
opened
a
door
at
the
back
samuel
followed
never
before
had
he
penetrated
so
far
into
his
cousin
secrets
on
the
left
within
the
doorway
were
the
stairs
dark
on
the
right
a
shut
door
and
in
front
an
open
door
giving
on
to
a
yard
at
the
extremity
of
the
yard
he
discerned
a
building
vaguely
lit
and
naked
figures
strangely
moving
in
it
what
that
who
there
he
asked
sharply
that
the
bakehouse
daniel
replied
as
if
surprised
at
such
a
question
it
one
of
their
long
nights
never
during
the
brief
remainder
of
his
life
did
samuel
eat
a
mouthful
of
common
bread
without
recalling
that
midnight
apparition
he
had
lived
for
half
a
century
and
thoughtlessly
eaten
bread
as
though
loaves
grew
on
trees
listen
daniel
commanded
him
he
cocked
his
ear
and
caught
a
feeble
complaining
wail
from
an
upper
floor
that
dick
that
is
said
daniel
povey
it
sounded
more
like
the
distress
of
a
child
than
of
an
adventurous
young
man
of
or
so
but
is
he
in
pain
have
you
fetched
the
doctor
not
yet
answered
daniel
with
a
vacant
stare
samuel
gazed
at
him
closely
for
a
second
and
daniel
seemed
to
him
very
old
and
helpless
and
pathetic
a
man
unequal
to
the
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
and
yet
despite
the
dignified
snow
of
his
age
wistfully
boyish
samuel
thought
swiftly
this
has
been
too
much
for
him
he
almost
out
of
his
mind
that
the
explanation
some
got
to
take
charge
and
i
must
and
all
the
courageous
resolution
of
his
character
braced
itself
to
the
crisis
being
without
a
collar
being
in
slippers
and
his
suspenders
imperfectly
fastened
anyhow
these
things
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
the
crisis
i
just
run
upstairs
and
have
a
look
at
him
said
samuel
in
a
tone
daniel
did
not
reply
there
was
a
glimmer
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
samuel
mounted
found
the
and
turned
it
on
full
a
dingy
dirty
untidy
passage
was
revealed
the
very
antechamber
of
discomfort
guided
by
the
moans
samuel
entered
a
bedroom
which
was
in
a
shameful
condition
of
neglect
and
lighted
only
by
a
nearly
expired
candle
was
it
possible
that
a
could
so
lose
her
samuel
thought
of
his
own
abode
meticulously
and
impeccably
and
a
hard
bitterness
against
daniel
surged
up
in
his
soul
is
that
you
doctor
said
a
voice
from
the
bed
the
moans
ceased
samuel
raised
the
candle
dick
lay
there
his
face
on
which
was
a
beard
of
several
days
growth
distorted
by
anguish
sweating
his
tousled
brown
hair
was
limp
with
sweat
where
the
hell
the
doctor
the
young
man
demanded
brusquely
evidently
he
had
no
curiosity
about
samuel
presence
the
one
thing
that
struck
him
was
that
samuel
was
not
the
doctor
he
coming
he
coming
said
samuel
soothingly
well
if
he
is
here
soon
i
shall
be
damn
well
dead
said
dick
in
feeble
resentful
anger
i
can
tell
you
that
samuel
deposited
the
candle
and
ran
downstairs
i
say
daniel
he
said
roused
and
hot
this
is
really
ridiculous
why
on
earth
you
fetch
the
doctor
while
you
were
waiting
for
me
where
the
missis
daniel
povey
was
slowly
emptying
grains
of
indian
corn
out
of
his
into
one
of
the
big
receptacles
behind
the
counter
on
the
baker
side
of
the
shop
he
had
provisioned
himself
with
indian
corn
as
ammunition
for
samuel
bedroom
window
he
was
now
returning
the
surplus
are
ye
going
for
harrop
he
questioned
hesitatingly
why
of
course
samuel
exclaimed
where
the
missis
happen
you
better
go
and
have
a
look
at
her
said
daniel
povey
she
in
th
parlour
he
preceded
samuel
to
the
shut
door
on
the
right
when
he
opened
it
the
parlour
appeared
in
full
illumination
here
go
in
said
daniel
samuel
went
in
afraid
in
a
room
as
dishevelled
and
filthy
as
the
bedroom
daniel
povey
lay
stretched
awkwardly
on
a
worn
sofa
her
head
thrown
back
her
face
discoloured
her
eyes
bulging
her
mouth
wet
and
yawning
a
sight
horribly
offensive
samuel
was
frightened
he
was
struck
with
fear
and
with
disgust
the
singing
gas
beat
down
ruthlessly
on
that
dreadful
figure
a
wife
and
mother
the
lady
of
a
house
the
centre
of
order
the
fount
of
healing
the
balm
for
worry
and
the
refuge
of
distress
she
was
vile
her
scanty
hair
was
dirty
her
hollowed
neck
all
grime
her
hands
abominable
her
black
dress
in
decay
she
was
the
dishonour
of
her
sex
her
situation
and
her
years
she
was
a
fouler
obscenity
than
the
inexperienced
samuel
had
ever
conceived
and
by
the
door
stood
her
husband
neat
spotless
almost
stately
the
man
who
for
thirty
years
had
marshalled
all
his
immense
pride
to
suffer
this
woman
the
jolly
man
who
had
laughed
through
thick
and
thin
samuel
remembered
when
they
were
married
and
he
remembered
when
years
after
their
marriage
she
was
still
as
pretty
artificial
coquettish
and
adamantine
in
her
caprices
as
a
young
harlot
with
a
fool
at
her
feet
time
and
the
slow
wrath
of
god
had
changed
her
he
remained
master
of
himself
and
approached
her
then
stopped
but
he
stammered
ay
lad
said
the
old
man
from
the
door
i
doubt
i
killed
her
i
doubt
i
killed
her
i
took
and
shook
her
i
got
her
by
the
neck
and
before
i
knew
where
i
was
i
done
it
she
never
drink
brandy
again
this
is
what
it
come
to
he
moved
away
all
samuel
flesh
tingled
as
a
heavy
wave
of
emotion
rolled
through
his
being
it
was
just
as
if
some
one
had
dealt
him
a
blow
unimaginably
tremendous
his
heart
shivered
as
a
ship
shivers
at
the
mountainous
crash
of
the
waters
he
was
numbed
he
wanted
to
weep
to
vomit
to
die
to
sink
away
but
a
voice
was
whispering
to
him
you
will
have
to
go
through
with
this
you
are
in
charge
of
this
he
thought
of
his
wife
and
child
innocently
asleep
in
the
cleanly
pureness
of
his
home
and
he
felt
the
roughness
of
his
round
his
neck
and
the
insecurity
of
his
trousers
he
passed
out
of
the
room
shutting
the
door
and
across
the
yard
he
had
a
momentary
glimpse
of
those
nude
nocturnal
forms
unconsciously
attitudinizing
in
the
bakehouse
and
down
the
stairs
came
the
protests
of
dick
driven
by
pain
into
a
monotonous
silly
blasphemy
i
fetch
harrop
he
said
melancholily
to
his
cousin
the
doctor
house
was
less
than
fifty
yards
off
and
the
doctor
had
a
which
though
he
was
a
much
older
man
than
his
father
had
been
at
his
age
he
still
answered
promptly
no
need
to
bombard
the
doctor
premises
with
indian
corn
while
samuel
was
parleying
with
the
doctor
through
a
window
the
question
ran
incessantly
through
his
mind
what
about
telling
the
police
but
when
in
advance
of
old
harrop
he
returned
to
daniel
shop
lo
the
policeman
previously
encountered
had
returned
upon
his
beat
and
daniel
was
talking
to
him
in
the
little
doorway
no
other
soul
was
about
down
king
street
along
wedgwood
street
up
the
square
towards
brougham
street
nothing
but
gaslamps
burning
with
their
everlasting
patience
and
the
blind
facades
of
shops
only
in
the
second
storey
of
the
bank
building
at
the
top
of
the
square
a
light
showed
mysteriously
through
a
blind
somebody
ill
there
the
policeman
was
in
a
high
state
of
nervous
excitement
that
had
happened
to
him
which
had
never
happened
to
him
before
of
the
sixty
policemen
in
bursley
just
he
had
been
chosen
by
fate
to
fit
the
socket
of
destiny
he
was
startled
what
this
what
this
mr
povey
he
turned
hastily
to
samuel
what
this
as
councillor
povey
is
me
you
come
in
sergeant
said
daniel
if
i
come
in
said
the
policeman
to
samuel
you
mun
go
along
wedgwood
street
povey
and
bring
my
mate
he
should
be
on
duck
bank
by
rights
it
was
astonishing
when
once
the
stone
had
begun
to
roll
how
quickly
it
ran
in
half
an
hour
samuel
had
actually
parted
from
daniel
at
the
behind
the
shambles
and
was
hurrying
to
rouse
his
wife
so
that
she
could
look
after
dick
povey
until
he
might
be
taken
off
to
pirehill
infirmary
as
old
harrop
had
instantly
on
seeing
him
decreed
ah
he
reflected
in
the
turmoil
of
his
soul
god
is
not
mocked
that
was
his
basic
idea
god
is
not
mocked
daniel
was
a
good
fellow
honourable
brilliant
a
figure
in
the
world
but
what
of
his
licentious
tongue
what
of
his
frequenting
of
bars
how
had
he
come
to
miss
that
train
from
liverpool
how
for
many
years
he
samuel
had
seen
in
daniel
a
living
refutation
of
the
authenticity
of
the
old
hebrew
menaces
but
he
had
been
wrong
after
all
god
is
not
mocked
and
samuel
was
aware
of
a
revulsion
in
himself
towards
that
strict
codified
godliness
from
which
in
thought
he
had
perhaps
been
slipping
away
and
with
it
all
he
felt
too
a
certain
officious
as
he
woke
his
wife
and
essayed
to
break
the
news
to
her
in
a
manner
tactfully
calm
he
had
assisted
at
the
most
overwhelming
event
ever
known
in
the
history
of
the
town
ii
your
muffler
i
get
it
said
constance
cyril
run
upstairs
and
get
father
muffler
you
know
the
drawer
cyril
ran
it
behoved
everybody
that
morning
to
be
prompt
and
efficient
i
do
need
any
muffler
thank
you
said
samuel
coughing
and
smothering
the
cough
oh
but
sam
constance
protested
now
please
do
worry
me
said
samuel
with
frigid
finality
got
quite
enough
he
did
not
finish
constance
sighed
as
her
husband
stepped
nervous
and
out
of
the
into
the
street
it
was
early
not
yet
eight
and
the
shop
still
unopened
your
father
could
wait
constance
said
to
cyril
when
he
had
thundered
down
the
stairs
in
his
heavy
schoolboy
boots
give
it
to
me
she
went
to
restore
the
muffler
to
its
place
the
whole
house
was
upset
and
amy
still
an
invalid
existence
was
disturbed
there
vaguely
seemed
to
be
a
thousand
novel
things
to
be
done
and
yet
she
could
think
of
nothing
whatever
that
she
needed
to
do
at
that
moment
so
she
occupied
herself
with
the
muffler
before
she
reappeared
cyril
had
gone
to
school
he
who
was
usually
a
laggard
the
truth
was
that
he
could
no
longer
contain
within
himself
a
recital
of
the
night
and
in
particular
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
the
first
to
hear
the
summons
of
the
murderer
on
the
this
imperious
news
had
to
be
imparted
to
somebody
as
a
preliminary
to
the
thrilling
of
the
whole
school
and
cyril
had
issued
forth
in
search
of
an
appreciative
and
worthy
confidant
he
was
scarcely
five
minutes
after
his
father
in
luke
square
was
a
crowd
of
quite
two
hundred
persons
standing
moveless
in
the
november
mud
the
body
of
daniel
povey
had
already
been
taken
to
the
tiger
hotel
and
young
dick
povey
was
on
his
way
in
a
covered
wagonette
to
pirehill
infirmary
on
the
other
side
of
knype
the
shop
of
the
crime
was
closed
and
the
blinds
drawn
at
the
upper
windows
of
the
house
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
be
seen
not
even
a
policeman
nevertheless
the
crowd
stared
with
an
extraordinary
obstinate
attentiveness
at
the
fatal
building
in
boulton
terrace
hypnotized
by
this
face
of
bricks
and
mortar
it
had
apparently
forgotten
all
earthly
ties
and
regardless
of
breakfast
and
a
livelihood
was
determined
to
stare
at
it
till
the
house
fell
down
or
otherwise
rendered
up
its
secret
most
of
its
component
individuals
wore
neither
overcoats
nor
collars
but
were
kept
warm
by
a
scarf
round
the
neck
and
by
dint
of
forcing
their
fingers
into
the
furthest
inch
of
their
pockets
then
they
would
slowly
lift
one
leg
after
the
other
starers
of
infirm
purpose
would
occasionally
detach
themselves
from
the
throng
and
sidle
away
ashamed
of
their
fickleness
but
reinforcements
were
continually
arriving
and
to
these
all
that
had
been
said
in
gossip
had
to
be
repeated
and
repeated
the
same
questions
the
same
answers
the
same
exclamations
the
same
proverbial
philosophy
the
same
prophecies
recurred
in
all
parts
of
the
square
with
an
uncanny
iterance
men
spoke
to
mere
professional
loiterers
for
this
unparalleled
and
glorious
sensation
whose
uniqueness
grew
every
instant
more
impressive
brought
out
the
essential
brotherhood
of
mankind
all
had
a
peculiar
feeling
that
the
day
was
neither
sunday
nor
but
some
eighth
day
of
the
week
yet
in
the
covered
market
close
by
the
were
preparing
their
stalls
just
as
though
it
were
saturday
just
as
though
a
town
councillor
had
not
murdered
his
wife
at
last
it
was
stated
and
restated
infinitely
that
the
povey
baking
had
been
taken
over
by
brindley
the
baker
and
confectioner
who
had
a
stall
in
the
market
and
it
was
asserted
as
a
philosophical
truth
and
reasserted
infinitely
that
there
would
have
been
no
sense
in
wasting
good
food
samuel
emergence
stirred
the
multitude
but
samuel
passed
up
the
square
with
a
rapt
expression
he
might
have
been
under
an
illusion
caused
by
the
extreme
gravity
of
his
preoccupations
that
he
was
crossing
a
deserted
square
he
hurried
past
the
bank
and
down
the
turnhill
road
to
the
private
residence
of
lawton
son
of
the
deceased
lawton
young
lawton
followed
his
profession
he
was
as
his
father
had
been
the
most
successful
solicitor
in
the
town
though
reputed
by
his
learned
rivals
to
be
a
fool
but
the
custom
of
calling
men
by
their
occupations
had
died
out
with
samuel
caught
young
lawton
at
his
breakfast
and
presently
drove
with
him
in
the
lawton
buggy
to
the
where
their
arrival
electrified
a
crowd
as
large
as
that
in
square
later
they
drove
together
to
hanbridge
informally
to
brief
a
barrister
and
samuel
not
permitted
to
be
present
at
the
first
part
of
the
interview
between
the
solicitor
and
the
barrister
was
humbled
before
the
pomposity
of
legal
etiquette
it
seemed
to
samuel
a
game
the
whole
rigmarole
of
police
and
and
formalities
seemed
insincere
his
cousin
case
was
not
like
any
other
case
and
though
formalities
might
be
necessary
it
was
rather
absurd
to
pretend
that
it
was
like
any
other
case
in
what
manner
it
differed
from
other
cases
samuel
did
not
analytically
inquire
he
thought
young
lawton
was
and
daniel
too
humble
in
the
colloquy
of
these
two
and
he
endeavoured
to
indicate
by
the
dignity
of
his
own
demeanour
that
in
his
opinion
the
proper
relative
tones
had
not
been
set
he
could
not
understand
attitude
for
he
lacked
imagination
to
realize
what
daniel
had
been
through
after
all
daniel
was
not
a
murderer
his
wife
death
was
due
to
accident
was
simply
a
mishap
but
in
the
crowded
and
stinking
of
the
town
hall
samuel
began
to
feel
qualms
it
occurred
that
the
stipendiary
magistrate
was
sitting
that
morning
at
bursley
he
sat
alone
as
not
one
of
the
borough
justices
cared
to
occupy
the
bench
while
a
town
councillor
was
in
the
dock
the
stipendiary
recently
appointed
was
a
young
man
from
the
southern
part
of
the
county
and
a
town
councillor
of
bursley
was
no
more
to
him
than
a
petty
tradesman
to
a
man
of
fashion
he
was
youthfully
enthusiastic
for
the
majesty
and
the
impartiality
of
english
justice
and
behaved
as
though
the
entire
responsibility
for
the
safety
of
that
vast
fabric
rested
on
his
shoulders
he
and
the
barrister
from
hanbridge
had
had
a
historic
quarrel
at
cambridge
and
their
behaviour
to
each
other
was
a
lesson
to
the
vulgar
in
the
art
of
chill
and
consummate
politeness
young
lawton
having
been
to
oxford
secretly
scorned
the
pair
of
them
but
as
he
had
engaged
counsel
he
of
course
was
precluded
from
adding
to
the
eloquence
which
chagrined
him
these
three
were
the
aristocracy
of
the
they
knew
it
samuel
povey
knew
it
everybody
knew
it
and
felt
it
the
barrister
brought
an
unexceptionable
zeal
to
the
performance
of
his
duties
he
referred
in
suitable
terms
to
daniel
character
and
high
position
in
the
town
but
nothing
could
hide
the
fact
that
for
him
too
his
client
was
a
petty
tradesman
accused
of
simple
murder
naturally
the
stipendiary
was
bound
to
show
that
before
the
law
all
men
are
equal
the
town
councillor
and
the
common
tippler
he
succeeded
the
policeman
gave
his
evidence
and
the
inspector
swore
to
what
daniel
povey
had
said
when
charged
the
hearing
proceeded
so
smoothly
and
quickly
that
it
seemed
naught
but
an
empty
rite
with
daniel
as
a
lay
figure
in
it
the
stipendiary
achieved
marvellously
the
illusion
that
to
him
a
murder
by
a
town
councillor
in
luke
square
was
quite
an
everyday
matter
bail
was
inconceivable
and
the
barrister
being
unable
to
suggest
any
reason
why
the
stipendiary
should
grant
a
remand
indeed
there
was
no
reason
daniel
povey
was
committed
to
the
stafford
assizes
for
trial
the
stipendiary
instantly
turned
to
the
consideration
of
an
alleged
offence
against
the
factory
acts
by
a
large
local
firm
of
potters
the
young
magistrate
had
mistaken
his
vocation
with
his
steely
calm
with
his
imperturbable
detachment
from
weak
humanity
he
ought
to
have
been
a
general
of
the
order
of
jesuits
daniel
was
removed
he
did
not
go
he
was
removed
by
two
constables
samuel
wanted
to
have
speech
with
him
and
could
not
and
later
samuel
stood
in
the
porch
of
the
town
hall
and
daniel
appeared
out
of
a
corridor
still
in
the
keeping
of
two
policemen
helmeted
now
and
down
below
at
the
bottom
of
the
broad
flight
of
steps
up
which
passed
dancers
on
the
nights
of
subscription
balls
was
a
dense
crowd
held
at
bay
by
other
policemen
and
beyond
the
crowd
a
black
van
and
daniel
to
his
cousin
a
sort
of
christ
between
thieves
was
hurried
past
the
privileged
loafers
in
the
corridor
and
down
the
broad
steps
a
murmuring
wave
agitated
the
crowd
unkempt
idlers
and
in
corduroy
leaped
up
like
tigers
in
the
air
and
the
policemen
fought
them
back
furiously
and
daniel
and
his
guardians
shot
through
the
little
living
lane
quick
quick
for
the
captive
is
more
sacred
even
than
a
messiah
the
law
has
him
in
charge
and
like
a
feat
of
prestidigitation
daniel
disappeared
into
the
blackness
of
the
van
a
door
slammed
loudly
triumphantly
and
a
whip
cracked
the
crowd
had
been
balked
it
was
as
though
the
crowd
had
yelled
for
daniel
blood
and
bones
and
the
faithful
constables
had
saved
him
from
their
lust
yes
samuel
had
qualms
he
had
a
sickness
in
the
stomach
the
aged
superintendent
of
police
walked
by
with
the
aged
rector
the
rector
was
daniel
friend
never
before
had
the
rector
spoken
to
the
nonconformist
samuel
but
now
he
spoke
to
him
he
squeezed
his
hand
ah
mr
povey
he
ejaculated
grievously
i
i
afraid
it
serious
samuel
stammered
he
hated
to
admit
that
it
was
serious
but
the
words
came
out
of
his
mouth
he
looked
at
the
superintendent
of
police
expecting
the
superintendent
to
assure
him
that
it
was
not
serious
but
the
superintendent
only
raised
his
small
chin
saying
nothing
the
rector
shook
his
head
and
shook
a
senile
tear
out
of
his
eye
after
another
chat
with
young
lawton
samuel
on
behalf
of
daniel
dropped
his
pose
of
the
righteous
man
to
whom
a
mere
mishap
has
occurred
and
who
is
determined
with
the
lofty
pride
of
innocence
to
indulge
all
the
whims
of
the
law
to
be
more
royalist
than
the
king
he
perceived
that
the
law
must
be
fought
with
its
own
weapons
that
no
advantage
must
be
surrendered
and
every
possible
advantage
seized
he
was
truly
astonished
at
himself
that
such
a
pose
had
ever
been
adopted
his
eyes
were
opened
he
saw
things
as
they
were
he
returned
home
through
a
square
that
was
more
interested
than
ever
in
the
facade
of
his
cousin
house
people
were
beginning
to
come
from
hanbridge
knype
longshaw
turnhill
and
villages
such
as
moorthorne
to
gaze
at
that
facade
and
the
fourth
edition
of
the
signal
containing
a
full
report
of
what
the
stipendiary
and
the
barrister
had
said
to
each
other
was
being
cried
in
his
shop
he
found
customers
as
absorbed
in
the
trivialities
of
purchase
as
though
nothing
whatever
had
happened
he
was
shocked
he
resented
their
callousness
i
too
busy
now
he
said
curtly
to
one
who
accosted
him
sam
his
wife
called
him
in
a
low
voice
she
was
standing
behind
the
till
what
is
it
he
was
ready
to
crush
and
especially
to
crush
indiscreet
babble
in
the
shop
he
thought
she
was
going
to
vent
her
womanly
curiosity
at
once
huntbach
is
waiting
for
you
in
the
parlour
said
constance
mr
huntbach
yes
from
longshaw
she
whispered
it
povey
cousin
come
to
see
about
the
funeral
and
so
on
the
the
inquest
i
suppose
samuel
paused
oh
has
he
said
he
defiantly
well
i
see
him
if
he
wants
to
see
me
i
see
him
that
evening
constance
learned
all
that
was
in
his
mind
of
bitterness
against
the
memory
of
the
dead
woman
whose
failings
had
brought
daniel
povey
to
stafford
gaol
and
dick
to
the
pirehill
infirmary
again
and
again
in
the
ensuing
days
he
referred
to
the
state
of
foul
discomfort
which
he
had
discovered
in
daniel
house
he
nursed
a
feud
against
all
her
relatives
and
when
after
the
inquest
at
which
he
gave
evidence
full
of
resentment
she
was
buried
he
vented
an
angry
sigh
of
relief
and
said
well
she
out
of
the
way
thenceforward
he
had
a
mission
religious
in
its
solemn
intensity
to
defend
and
save
daniel
he
took
the
enterprise
upon
himself
spending
the
whole
of
himself
upon
it
to
the
neglect
of
his
business
and
the
scorn
of
his
health
he
lived
solely
for
daniel
trial
pouring
out
money
in
preparation
for
it
he
thought
and
spoke
of
nothing
else
the
affair
was
his
one
preoccupation
and
as
the
weeks
passed
he
became
more
and
more
sure
of
success
more
and
more
sure
that
he
would
return
with
daniel
to
bursley
in
triumph
after
the
assize
he
was
convinced
of
the
impossibility
that
should
happen
to
daniel
the
circumstances
were
too
clear
too
overwhelmingly
in
daniel
favour
when
brindley
the
baker
and
confectioner
made
an
offer
for
daniel
business
as
a
going
concern
he
was
indignant
at
first
then
constance
and
the
lawyer
and
daniel
whom
he
saw
on
every
permitted
occasion
between
them
persuaded
him
that
if
some
arrangement
was
not
made
and
made
quickly
the
business
would
lose
all
its
value
and
he
consented
on
daniel
behalf
to
a
temporary
agreement
under
which
brindley
should
reopen
the
shop
and
manage
it
on
certain
terms
until
daniel
regained
his
freedom
towards
the
end
of
january
he
would
not
listen
to
daniel
plaintive
insistence
that
he
would
never
care
to
be
seen
in
bursley
again
he
it
he
protested
furiously
that
the
whole
town
was
seething
with
sympathy
for
daniel
and
this
was
true
he
became
daniel
defending
angel
rescuing
daniel
from
own
weakness
and
apathy
he
became
indeed
daniel
one
morning
the
was
wound
up
and
brindley
inflated
with
the
importance
of
controlling
two
establishments
strutted
in
and
out
under
the
sign
of
daniel
povey
and
traffic
in
bread
and
cakes
and
flour
was
resumed
apparently
the
sea
of
time
had
risen
and
covered
daniel
and
all
that
was
his
for
his
wife
was
under
earth
and
dick
lingered
at
pirehill
unable
to
stand
and
daniel
was
locked
away
apparently
in
the
regular
flow
of
the
life
of
the
square
daniel
was
forgotten
but
not
in
samuel
povey
heart
was
he
forgotten
there
before
an
altar
erected
to
the
martyr
the
sacred
flame
of
a
new
faith
burned
with
fierce
consistency
samuel
in
his
greying
had
inherited
the
eternal
youth
of
the
apostle
iii
on
the
dark
winter
morning
when
samuel
set
off
to
the
grand
assize
constance
did
not
ask
his
views
as
to
what
protection
he
would
adopt
against
the
weather
she
silently
ranged
special
underclothing
and
by
the
warmth
of
the
fire
which
for
days
she
had
kept
ablaze
in
the
bedroom
samuel
silently
donned
the
special
underclothing
over
that
with
particular
fastidious
care
he
put
his
best
suit
not
a
word
was
spoken
constance
and
he
were
not
estranged
but
the
relations
between
them
were
in
a
state
of
feverish
excitation
samuel
had
had
a
cold
on
his
flat
chest
for
weeks
and
nothing
that
constance
could
invent
would
move
it
a
few
days
in
bed
or
even
in
one
room
at
a
uniform
temperature
would
have
surely
worked
the
cure
samuel
however
would
not
stay
in
one
room
he
would
not
stay
in
the
house
nor
yet
in
bursley
he
would
take
his
lacerating
cough
on
chilly
trains
to
stafford
he
had
no
ears
for
reason
he
simply
could
not
listen
he
was
in
a
dream
after
christmas
a
crisis
came
constance
grew
desperate
it
was
a
battle
between
her
will
and
his
that
occurred
one
night
when
constance
marshalling
all
her
forces
suddenly
insisted
that
he
must
go
out
no
more
until
he
was
cured
in
the
fight
constance
was
scarcely
recognizable
she
deliberately
gave
way
to
hysteria
she
was
no
longer
soft
and
gentle
she
flung
bitterness
at
him
like
vitriol
she
shrieked
like
a
common
shrew
it
seems
almost
incredible
that
constance
should
have
gone
so
far
but
she
did
she
accused
him
amid
sobs
of
putting
his
cousin
before
his
wife
and
son
of
not
caring
whether
or
not
she
was
left
a
widow
as
the
result
of
this
obstinacy
and
she
ended
by
crying
passionately
that
she
might
as
well
talk
to
a
post
she
might
just
as
well
have
talked
to
a
post
samuel
answered
quietly
and
coldly
he
told
her
that
it
was
useless
for
her
to
put
herself
about
as
he
should
act
as
he
thought
fit
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
scene
and
quite
unique
in
their
annals
constance
was
beaten
she
accepted
the
defeat
gradually
controlling
her
sobs
and
changing
her
tone
to
the
tone
of
the
vanquished
she
kissed
him
in
bed
kissing
the
rod
and
he
gravely
kissed
her
henceforward
she
knew
in
practice
what
the
inevitable
when
you
have
to
live
with
it
may
contain
of
anguish
wretched
and
humiliating
her
husband
was
risking
his
life
so
she
was
absolutely
convinced
and
she
could
do
nothing
she
had
come
to
the
of
samuel
character
she
felt
that
for
the
time
being
she
had
a
madman
in
the
house
who
could
not
be
treated
according
to
ordinary
principles
the
continual
strain
aged
her
her
one
source
of
relief
was
to
talk
with
cyril
she
talked
to
him
without
reserve
and
the
words
father
father
were
everlastingly
on
her
complaining
tongue
yes
she
was
utterly
changed
often
she
would
weep
when
alone
nevertheless
she
frequently
forgot
that
she
had
been
beaten
she
had
no
notion
of
honourable
warfare
she
was
always
beginning
again
always
firing
under
a
flag
of
truce
and
thus
she
constituted
a
very
inconvenient
opponent
samuel
was
obliged
while
hardening
on
the
main
point
to
compromise
on
lesser
questions
she
too
could
be
formidable
and
when
her
lips
took
a
certain
pose
and
her
eyes
glowed
he
would
have
put
on
forty
mufflers
had
she
commanded
thus
it
was
she
who
arranged
all
the
details
of
the
supreme
journey
to
stafford
samuel
was
to
drive
to
knype
so
as
to
avoid
the
rigours
of
the
loop
line
train
from
bursley
and
the
waiting
on
cold
platforms
at
knype
he
was
to
take
the
express
and
to
travel
after
he
was
dressed
on
that
morning
he
learnt
bit
by
bit
the
extent
of
her
elaborate
preparations
the
breakfast
was
a
special
breakfast
and
he
had
to
eat
it
all
then
the
cab
came
and
he
saw
amy
put
hot
bricks
into
it
constance
herself
put
goloshes
over
his
boots
not
because
it
was
damp
but
because
indiarubber
keeps
the
feet
warm
constance
herself
bandaged
his
neck
and
unbuttoned
his
waistcoat
and
stuck
an
extra
flannel
under
his
dickey
constance
herself
warmed
his
woollen
gloves
and
enveloped
him
in
his
largest
overcoat
samuel
then
saw
cyril
getting
ready
to
go
out
where
are
you
off
he
demanded
he
going
with
you
as
far
as
knype
said
constance
grimly
see
you
into
the
train
and
then
come
back
here
in
the
cab
she
had
sprung
this
indignity
upon
him
she
glared
cyril
glanced
with
timid
bravado
from
one
to
the
other
samuel
had
to
yield
thus
in
the
winter
darkness
for
it
was
not
yet
dawn
samuel
set
forth
to
the
trial
escorted
by
his
son
the
reverberation
of
his
appalling
cough
from
the
cab
was
the
last
thing
that
constance
heard
during
most
of
the
day
constance
sat
in
insull
corner
in
the
shop
twenty
years
ago
this
very
corner
had
been
hers
but
now
instead
of
large
enwrapped
in
brown
paper
it
was
shut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
counter
by
a
rich
screen
of
mahogany
and
and
within
the
enclosed
space
all
the
apparatus
necessary
to
the
activity
of
miss
insull
had
been
provided
for
however
it
remained
the
coldest
part
of
the
whole
shop
as
miss
insull
fingers
testified
constance
established
herself
there
more
from
a
desire
to
do
something
to
interfere
in
something
than
from
a
necessity
of
supervising
the
shop
though
she
had
said
to
samuel
that
she
would
keep
an
eye
on
the
shop
miss
insull
whose
throne
was
usurped
had
to
sit
by
the
stove
with
less
important
creatures
she
did
not
like
it
and
her
underlings
suffered
accordingly
it
was
a
long
day
towards
just
before
cyril
was
due
from
school
critchlow
came
surprisingly
in
that
is
to
say
his
arrival
was
less
of
a
surprise
to
miss
insull
and
the
rest
of
the
staff
than
to
constance
for
he
had
lately
formed
an
irregular
habit
of
popping
in
at
to
chat
with
miss
insull
critchlow
was
still
defying
time
he
kept
his
long
thin
figure
perfectly
erect
his
features
had
not
altered
his
hair
and
beard
could
not
have
been
whiter
than
they
had
been
for
years
past
he
wore
his
long
white
apron
and
over
that
a
thick
reefer
jacket
in
his
long
knotty
fingers
he
carried
a
copy
of
the
signal
evidently
he
had
not
expected
to
find
the
corner
occupied
by
constance
she
was
sewing
so
it
you
he
said
in
his
unpleasant
grating
voice
not
even
glancing
at
miss
insull
he
had
gained
the
reputation
of
being
the
rudest
old
man
in
bursley
but
his
general
demeanour
expressed
indifference
rather
than
rudeness
it
was
a
manner
that
said
got
to
take
me
as
i
am
i
may
be
an
egotist
hard
mean
and
convinced
but
those
who
do
like
it
can
lump
it
i
indifferent
he
put
one
elbow
on
the
top
of
the
screen
showing
the
signal
mr
critchlow
said
constance
primly
she
had
acquired
dislike
of
him
it
begun
he
observed
with
mysterious
glee
has
it
constance
said
eagerly
is
it
in
the
paper
already
she
had
been
far
more
disturbed
about
her
husband
health
than
about
the
trial
of
daniel
povey
for
murder
but
her
interest
in
the
trial
was
of
course
tremendous
and
this
news
that
it
had
actually
begun
thrilled
her
ay
said
critchlow
did
ye
hear
the
signal
boy
hollering
just
now
all
over
the
square
no
said
constance
for
her
newspapers
did
not
exist
she
never
had
the
idea
of
opening
one
never
felt
any
curiosity
which
she
could
not
satisfy
if
she
could
satisfy
it
at
all
without
the
powerful
aid
of
the
press
and
even
on
this
day
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
the
signal
might
be
worth
opening
ay
repeated
critchlow
seemingly
it
began
at
two
or
thereabouts
he
gave
a
moment
of
his
attention
to
a
noisy
which
he
carefully
lowered
what
does
it
say
nothing
yet
said
critchlow
and
they
read
the
few
brief
sentences
under
their
big
heading
which
described
the
formal
commencement
of
the
trial
of
daniel
povey
for
the
murder
of
his
wife
there
was
some
as
said
he
remarked
pushing
up
his
spectacles
that
grand
jury
would
alter
the
charge
or
summat
he
laughed
grimly
tolerant
of
the
extreme
absurdity
ah
he
added
contemplatively
turning
his
head
to
see
if
the
assistants
were
listening
they
were
it
would
have
been
too
much
on
such
a
day
to
expect
a
strict
adherence
to
the
etiquette
of
the
shop
constance
had
been
hearing
a
good
deal
lately
of
grand
juries
but
she
had
understood
nothing
nor
had
she
sought
to
understand
i
very
glad
it
come
on
so
soon
she
said
in
a
sense
that
is
i
was
afraid
sam
might
be
kept
at
stafford
for
days
do
you
think
it
will
last
long
not
it
said
critchlow
positively
there
naught
in
it
to
spin
out
then
a
silence
punctuated
by
the
sound
of
stitching
constance
would
really
have
preferred
not
to
converse
with
the
old
man
but
the
desire
for
reassurance
for
the
calming
of
her
own
fears
forced
her
to
speak
though
she
knew
well
that
critchlow
was
precisely
the
last
man
in
the
town
to
give
moral
assistance
if
he
thought
it
was
wanted
i
do
hope
everything
will
be
all
right
she
murmured
everything
be
all
right
he
said
gaily
everything
be
all
right
only
it
be
all
wrong
for
dan
whatever
do
you
mean
mr
critchlow
she
protested
nothing
she
reflected
could
rouse
pity
in
that
heart
not
even
a
tragedy
like
daniel
she
bit
her
lip
for
having
spoken
well
he
said
in
loud
tones
frankly
addressing
the
girls
round
the
stove
as
much
as
constance
i
met
with
some
rare
good
arguments
this
new
year
no
mistake
there
been
some
as
say
that
dan
never
meant
to
do
it
that
as
may
be
but
if
it
a
good
reason
for
not
hanging
there
an
end
to
capital
punishment
in
this
country
meant
there
a
lot
of
as
meant
then
i
told
as
she
was
a
gallivanting
woman
and
no
housekeeper
and
as
often
drunk
as
sober
i
no
call
to
be
told
that
if
strangling
is
a
right
punishment
for
a
wife
as
spends
her
time
in
drinking
brandy
instead
of
sweeping
floors
and
airing
sheets
then
dan
safe
but
i
do
seem
to
see
judge
lindley
telling
the
jury
as
it
is
i
been
a
juryman
under
judge
lindley
myself
and
more
than
once
and
i
do
seem
to
see
him
like
he
paused
with
his
mouth
open
as
for
all
them
nobs
he
continued
including
th
rector
as
have
gone
to
stafford
to
kiss
the
book
and
swear
that
dan
reputation
is
second
to
none
if
they
could
ha
sworn
as
dan
was
in
th
house
at
all
that
night
if
they
could
ha
sworn
he
was
in
jericho
there
ha
been
some
sense
in
their
going
but
as
it
is
they
ha
done
better
to
stop
at
home
and
mind
their
business
bless
us
sam
wanted
me
to
go
he
laughed
again
in
the
faces
of
the
horrified
and
angry
women
i
surprised
at
you
critchlow
i
really
am
constance
exclaimed
and
the
assistants
inarticulately
supported
her
with
vague
sounds
miss
insull
got
up
and
poked
the
stove
every
soul
in
the
establishment
was
loyally
convinced
that
daniel
povey
would
be
acquitted
and
to
breathe
a
doubt
on
the
brightness
of
this
certainty
was
a
hideous
crime
the
conviction
was
not
within
the
domain
of
reason
it
was
an
act
of
faith
and
arguments
merely
fretted
without
in
the
slightest
degree
disturbing
it
ye
may
be
critchlow
gaily
concurred
he
was
very
content
just
as
he
shuffled
round
to
leave
the
shop
cyril
entered
good
afternoon
critchlow
said
cyril
sheepishly
polite
critchlow
gazed
hard
at
the
boy
then
nodded
his
head
several
times
rapidly
as
though
to
say
here
another
fool
in
the
making
so
the
generations
follow
one
another
he
made
no
answer
to
the
salutation
and
departed
cyril
ran
round
to
his
mother
corner
pitching
his
bag
on
to
the
showroom
stairs
as
he
passed
them
taking
off
his
hat
he
kissed
her
and
she
unbuttoned
his
overcoat
with
her
cold
hands
what
old
methuselah
after
he
demanded
hush
constance
softly
corrected
him
he
came
in
to
tell
me
the
trial
had
started
oh
i
knew
that
a
boy
bought
a
paper
and
i
saw
it
i
say
mother
will
father
be
in
the
paper
and
then
in
a
different
tone
i
say
mother
what
is
there
for
tea
when
his
stomach
had
learnt
exactly
what
there
was
for
tea
the
boy
began
to
show
an
immense
and
talkative
curiosity
in
the
trial
he
would
not
set
himself
to
his
it
no
use
mother
he
said
i
ca
they
returned
to
the
shop
together
and
cyril
would
go
every
moment
to
the
door
to
listen
for
the
cry
of
a
newsboy
presently
he
hit
upon
the
idea
that
perhaps
newsboys
might
be
crying
the
special
edition
of
the
signal
in
the
in
front
of
the
town
hall
to
the
neglect
of
luke
square
and
nothing
would
satisfy
him
but
he
must
go
forth
and
see
he
went
without
his
overcoat
promising
to
run
the
shop
waited
with
a
strange
anxiety
cyril
had
created
by
his
restless
movements
to
and
fro
an
atmosphere
of
strained
expectancy
it
seemed
now
as
if
the
whole
town
stood
with
beating
heart
fearful
of
tidings
and
yet
burning
to
get
them
constance
pictured
stafford
which
she
had
never
seen
and
a
court
of
justice
which
she
had
never
seen
and
her
husband
and
daniel
in
it
and
she
waited
cyril
ran
in
no
he
announced
breathlessly
nothing
yet
do
take
cold
now
you
hot
constance
advised
but
he
would
keep
near
the
door
soon
he
ran
off
again
and
perhaps
fifteen
seconds
after
he
had
gone
the
strident
cry
of
a
signal
boy
was
heard
in
the
distance
faint
and
indistinct
at
first
then
clearer
and
louder
there
a
paper
said
the
apprentice
sh
said
constance
listening
sh
echoed
miss
insull
yes
it
is
said
constance
miss
insull
just
step
out
and
get
a
paper
here
a
halfpenny
the
halfpenny
passed
quickly
from
one
thimbled
hand
to
another
miss
insull
scurried
she
came
in
triumphantly
with
the
sheet
which
constance
tremblingly
took
constance
could
not
find
the
report
at
first
miss
insull
pointed
to
it
and
read
up
lower
down
lower
down
an
absence
of
minutes
the
jury
found
the
prisoner
guilty
of
murder
with
a
recommendation
to
mercy
the
judge
assumed
the
black
cap
and
pronounced
sentence
of
death
saying
that
he
would
forward
the
recommendation
to
the
proper
quarter
cyril
returned
not
yet
he
was
saying
when
he
saw
the
paper
lying
on
the
counter
his
crest
fell
long
after
the
shop
was
shut
constance
and
cyril
waited
in
the
parlour
for
the
arrival
of
the
master
of
the
house
constance
was
in
the
blackest
despair
she
saw
nothing
but
death
around
her
she
thought
misfortunes
never
come
singly
why
did
not
samuel
come
all
was
ready
for
him
everything
that
her
imagination
could
suggest
in
the
way
of
food
remedies
and
the
means
of
warmth
amy
was
not
allowed
to
go
to
bed
lest
she
might
be
needed
constance
did
not
even
hint
that
cyril
should
go
to
bed
the
dark
dreadful
minutes
ticked
themselves
off
on
the
mantelpiece
until
only
five
minutes
separated
constance
from
the
moment
when
she
would
not
know
what
to
do
next
it
was
minutes
past
eleven
if
at
samuel
did
not
appear
then
he
could
not
come
that
night
unless
the
last
train
from
stafford
was
inconceivably
late
the
sound
of
a
carriage
it
ceased
at
the
door
mother
and
son
sprang
up
yes
it
was
samuel
she
beheld
him
once
more
and
the
sight
of
his
condition
moral
and
physical
terrified
her
his
great
strapping
son
and
amy
helped
him
upstairs
will
he
ever
come
down
those
stairs
again
this
thought
lanced
constance
heart
the
pain
was
come
and
gone
in
a
moment
but
it
had
surprised
her
tranquil
commonsense
which
was
naturally
opposed
to
and
gently
scornful
of
hysterical
fears
as
she
puffed
with
her
stoutness
up
the
stairs
that
bland
cheerfulness
of
hers
cost
her
an
immense
effort
of
will
she
was
profoundly
troubled
great
disasters
seemed
to
be
slowly
approaching
her
from
all
quarters
should
she
send
for
the
doctor
no
to
do
so
would
only
be
a
concession
to
the
panic
instinct
she
knew
exactly
what
was
the
matter
with
samuel
a
severe
cough
persistently
neglected
no
more
as
she
had
expressed
herself
many
times
to
inquirers
he
never
been
what
you
may
call
nevertheless
as
she
laid
him
in
bed
and
possetted
him
how
frail
and
fragile
he
looked
and
he
was
so
exhausted
that
he
would
not
even
talk
about
the
trial
if
he
not
better
i
shall
send
for
the
doctor
she
said
to
herself
as
for
his
getting
up
she
swore
she
would
keep
him
in
bed
by
force
if
necessary
iv
the
next
morning
she
was
glad
and
proud
that
she
had
not
yielded
to
a
scare
for
he
was
most
strangely
and
obviously
better
he
had
slept
heavily
and
she
had
slept
a
little
true
that
daniel
was
condemned
to
death
leaving
daniel
to
his
fate
she
was
conscious
of
joy
springing
in
her
heart
how
absurd
to
have
asked
herself
will
he
ever
come
down
those
stairs
again
a
message
reached
her
from
the
forgotten
shop
during
the
morning
that
lawton
had
called
to
see
povey
already
samuel
had
wanted
to
arise
but
she
had
forbidden
it
in
the
tone
of
a
woman
who
is
dangerous
and
samuel
had
been
very
reasonable
he
now
said
that
lawton
must
be
asked
up
she
glanced
round
the
bedroom
it
was
it
was
faultlessly
correct
as
a
sick
chamber
she
agreed
to
the
introduction
into
it
of
the
man
from
another
sphere
and
after
a
preliminary
minute
she
left
the
two
to
talk
together
this
visit
of
young
lawton
was
a
dramatic
proof
of
samuel
importance
and
of
the
importance
of
the
matter
in
hand
the
august
occasion
demanded
etiquette
and
etiquette
said
that
a
wife
should
depart
from
her
husband
when
he
had
to
transact
affairs
beyond
the
grasp
of
a
wife
the
idea
of
a
petition
to
the
home
secretary
took
shape
at
this
interview
and
before
the
day
was
out
it
had
spread
over
the
town
and
over
the
five
towns
and
it
was
in
the
signal
the
signal
spoke
of
daniel
povey
as
condemned
man
and
the
phrase
startled
the
whole
district
into
an
indignant
agitation
for
his
reprieve
the
district
woke
up
to
the
fact
that
a
town
councillor
a
figure
in
the
world
an
honest
tradesman
of
unspotted
character
was
cooped
solitary
in
a
little
cell
at
stafford
waiting
to
be
hanged
by
the
neck
till
he
was
dead
the
district
determined
that
this
must
not
and
should
not
be
why
dan
povey
had
actually
once
been
chairman
of
the
bursley
society
for
the
prosecution
of
felons
that
association
for
annual
eating
and
drinking
whose
members
humorously
called
each
other
impossible
monstrous
that
an
of
the
should
be
a
sentenced
criminal
however
there
was
nothing
to
fear
no
home
secretary
would
dare
to
run
counter
to
the
jury
recommendation
and
the
expressed
wish
of
the
whole
district
besides
the
home
secretary
nephew
was
for
the
knype
division
of
course
a
verdict
of
guilty
had
been
inevitable
everybody
recognized
that
now
even
samuel
and
all
the
hottest
partisans
of
daniel
povey
recognized
it
they
talked
as
if
they
had
always
foreseen
it
directly
contradicting
all
that
they
had
said
on
only
the
previous
day
without
any
sense
of
any
inconsistency
or
of
shame
they
took
up
an
absolutely
new
position
the
structure
of
blind
faith
had
once
again
crumbled
at
the
assault
of
realities
and
unhealthy
truths
the
statement
of
which
would
have
meant
ostracism
hours
earlier
became
suddenly
the
platitudes
of
the
square
and
the
despatch
was
necessary
in
the
affair
of
the
petition
for
the
condemned
man
had
but
three
sundays
but
there
was
delay
at
the
beginning
because
neither
young
lawton
nor
any
of
his
colleagues
was
acquainted
with
the
proper
formula
of
a
petition
to
the
home
secretary
for
the
reprieve
of
a
criminal
condemned
to
death
no
such
petition
had
been
made
in
the
district
within
living
memory
and
at
first
young
lawton
could
not
get
sight
or
copy
of
any
such
petition
anywhere
in
the
five
towns
or
out
of
them
of
course
there
must
exist
a
proper
formula
and
of
course
that
formula
and
no
other
could
be
employed
nobody
was
bold
enough
to
suggest
that
young
lawton
should
commence
the
petition
to
the
most
noble
the
marquis
of
welwyn
may
it
please
your
lordship
and
end
it
and
your
petitioners
will
ever
pray
and
insert
between
those
phrases
a
simple
appeal
for
the
reprieve
with
a
statement
of
reasons
no
the
formula
consecrated
by
tradition
must
be
found
and
after
daniel
had
arrived
a
day
and
a
half
nearer
death
it
was
found
a
lawyer
at
alnwick
had
the
draft
of
a
petition
which
had
secured
for
a
murderer
in
northumberland
twenty
years
penal
servitude
instead
of
sudden
death
and
on
request
he
lent
it
to
young
lawton
the
prime
movers
in
the
petition
felt
that
daniel
povey
was
now
as
good
as
saved
hundreds
of
forms
were
printed
to
receive
signatures
and
these
forms
together
with
copies
of
the
petition
were
laid
on
the
counters
of
all
the
principal
shops
not
merely
in
bursley
but
in
the
other
towns
they
were
also
to
be
found
at
the
offices
of
the
signal
in
railway
and
in
the
various
and
on
the
second
of
daniel
three
sundays
they
were
exposed
in
the
porches
of
churches
and
chapels
and
vergers
would
come
to
samuel
and
ask
with
the
heavy
inertia
of
their
stupidity
about
pens
and
ink
sir
these
officials
had
the
air
of
audaciously
disturbing
the
sacrosanct
routine
of
centuries
in
order
to
confer
a
favour
samuel
continued
to
improve
his
cough
shook
him
less
and
his
appetite
increased
constance
allowed
him
to
establish
himself
in
the
which
was
next
to
the
bedroom
and
of
which
the
grate
was
particularly
efficient
here
in
an
old
winter
overcoat
he
directed
the
vast
affair
of
the
petition
which
grew
daily
to
vaster
proportions
samuel
dreamed
of
twenty
thousand
signatures
each
sheet
held
twenty
signatures
and
several
times
a
day
he
counted
the
sheets
the
supply
of
forms
actually
failed
once
and
constance
herself
had
to
hurry
to
the
printers
to
order
more
samuel
was
put
into
a
passion
by
this
carelessness
of
the
printers
he
offered
cyril
sixpence
for
every
sheet
of
signatures
which
the
boy
would
obtain
at
first
cyril
was
too
shy
to
canvass
but
his
father
made
him
blush
and
in
a
few
hours
cyril
had
developed
into
an
eager
canvasser
one
whole
day
he
stayed
away
from
school
to
canvas
altogether
he
earned
over
fifteen
shillings
quite
honestly
except
that
he
got
a
companion
to
forge
a
couple
of
signatures
with
addresses
lacking
at
the
end
of
a
last
sheet
generously
rewarding
him
with
sixpence
the
value
of
the
entire
sheet
when
samuel
had
received
a
thousand
sheets
with
twenty
thousand
signatures
he
set
his
heart
on
thousand
signatures
and
he
also
announced
his
firm
intention
of
accompanying
young
lawton
to
london
with
the
petition
the
petition
had
in
fact
become
one
of
the
most
remarkable
petitions
of
modern
times
so
the
signal
said
the
signal
gave
a
daily
account
of
its
progress
and
its
progress
was
astonishing
in
certain
streets
every
householder
had
signed
it
the
first
sheets
had
been
reserved
for
the
signatures
of
members
of
parliament
ministers
of
religion
civic
dignitaries
justices
of
the
peace
etc
these
sheets
were
nobly
filled
the
aged
rector
of
bursley
signed
first
of
all
after
him
the
mayor
of
bursley
as
was
right
then
sundry
samuel
emerged
from
the
he
went
into
the
parlour
and
later
into
the
shop
and
no
evil
consequence
followed
his
cough
was
nearly
but
not
quite
cured
the
weather
was
extraordinarily
mild
for
the
season
he
repeated
that
he
should
go
with
the
petition
to
london
and
he
went
constance
could
not
validly
oppose
the
journey
she
too
was
a
little
intoxicated
by
the
petition
it
weighed
considerably
over
a
hundredweight
the
crowning
signature
that
of
the
for
knype
was
duly
obtained
in
london
and
samuel
one
disappointment
was
that
his
hope
of
thousand
signatures
had
fallen
short
of
realization
by
only
a
few
score
the
few
score
could
have
been
got
had
not
time
urgently
pressed
he
returned
from
london
a
man
of
mark
full
of
confidence
but
his
cough
was
worse
again
his
confidence
in
the
power
of
public
opinion
and
the
inherent
virtue
of
justice
might
have
proved
to
be
well
placed
had
not
the
home
secretary
happened
to
be
one
of
your
humane
officials
the
marquis
of
welwyn
was
celebrated
through
every
stratum
of
the
governing
classes
for
his
humane
instincts
which
were
continually
fighting
against
his
sense
of
duty
unfortunately
his
sense
of
duty
which
he
had
inherited
from
several
centuries
of
ancestors
made
havoc
among
his
humane
instincts
on
nearly
every
occasion
of
conflict
it
was
reported
that
he
suffered
horribly
in
consequence
others
also
suffered
for
he
was
never
known
to
advise
a
remission
of
a
sentence
of
flogging
certain
capital
sentences
he
had
commuted
but
he
did
not
commute
daniel
povey
he
could
not
permit
himself
to
be
influenced
by
a
wave
of
popular
sentiment
and
assuredly
not
by
his
own
nephew
signature
he
gave
to
the
case
the
patient
remorseless
examination
which
he
gave
to
every
case
he
spent
a
sleepless
night
in
trying
to
discover
a
reason
for
yielding
to
his
humane
instincts
but
without
success
as
judge
lindley
remarked
in
his
confidential
report
the
sole
arguments
in
favour
of
daniel
were
provocation
and
his
previous
high
character
and
these
were
no
sort
of
an
argument
the
provocation
was
utterly
inadequate
and
the
previous
high
character
was
quite
too
ludicrously
beside
the
point
so
once
more
the
marquis
humane
instincts
were
routed
and
he
suffered
horribly
on
the
sunday
morning
after
the
day
on
which
the
signal
had
printed
the
menu
of
daniel
povey
supreme
breakfast
and
the
exact
length
of
the
which
the
executioner
had
administered
to
him
constance
and
cyril
stood
together
at
the
window
of
the
large
bedroom
the
boy
was
in
his
best
clothes
but
constance
garments
gave
no
sign
of
the
sabbath
she
wore
a
large
apron
over
an
old
dress
that
was
rather
tight
for
her
she
was
pale
and
looked
oh
mother
cyril
exclaimed
suddenly
listen
i
sure
i
can
hear
the
band
she
checked
him
with
a
soundless
movement
of
her
lips
and
they
both
glanced
anxiously
at
the
silent
bed
cyril
with
a
gesture
of
apology
for
having
forgotten
that
he
must
make
no
noise
the
strains
of
the
band
came
from
down
king
street
in
the
direction
of
luke
church
the
music
appeared
to
linger
a
long
time
in
the
distance
and
then
it
approached
growing
louder
and
the
bursley
town
silver
prize
band
passed
under
the
window
at
the
solemn
pace
of
handel
dead
march
the
effect
of
that
requiem
heavy
with
its
own
inherent
beauty
and
with
the
vast
weight
of
harrowing
tradition
was
to
wring
the
tears
from
constance
eyes
they
fell
on
her
aproned
bosom
and
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
though
the
cheeks
of
the
trumpeters
were
puffed
out
and
though
the
drummer
had
to
protrude
his
stomach
and
arch
his
spine
backwards
lest
he
should
tumble
over
his
drum
there
was
majesty
in
the
passage
of
the
band
the
boom
of
the
drum
desolating
the
interruptions
of
the
melody
made
sick
the
heart
but
with
a
lofty
grief
and
the
dirge
seemed
to
be
weaving
a
purple
pall
that
covered
every
meanness
the
bandsmen
were
not
all
in
black
but
they
all
wore
crape
on
their
sleeves
and
their
instruments
were
knotted
with
crape
they
carried
in
their
hats
a
card
cyril
held
one
of
these
cards
in
his
hands
it
ran
thus
sacred
to
the
memory
of
daniel
povey
a
town
councillor
of
this
town
judicially
murdered
at
in
the
morning
february
he
was
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
in
the
wake
of
the
band
came
the
aged
rector
and
wearing
a
surplice
over
his
overcoat
his
thin
white
hair
was
disarranged
by
the
breeze
that
played
in
the
chilly
sunshine
his
hands
were
folded
on
a
book
a
curate
churchwardens
and
sidesmen
followed
and
after
these
tramping
through
the
dark
mud
in
a
procession
that
had
apparently
no
end
wound
the
unofficial
male
multitude
nearly
all
in
mourning
and
all
save
the
more
aristocratic
carrying
the
memorial
card
in
their
hats
loafers
women
and
children
had
collected
on
the
drying
pavements
and
a
window
just
opposite
constance
was
ornamented
with
the
entire
family
of
the
landlord
of
the
sun
vaults
in
the
great
bar
of
the
vaults
a
barman
was
craning
over
the
pitchpine
screen
that
secured
privacy
to
drinkers
the
procession
continued
without
break
eternally
rising
over
the
verge
of
king
street
and
eternally
vanishing
round
the
corner
into
luke
square
at
intervals
it
was
punctuated
by
a
clergyman
a
nonconformist
minister
a
town
crier
a
group
of
foremen
or
a
few
rifle
volunteers
the
watching
crowd
grew
as
the
procession
lengthened
then
another
band
was
heard
also
playing
the
march
from
saul
the
first
band
had
now
reached
the
top
of
the
square
and
was
scarcely
audible
from
king
street
the
reiterated
glitter
in
the
sun
of
memorial
cards
in
hats
gave
the
fanciful
illusion
of
an
impossible
whitish
snake
that
was
straggling
across
the
town
of
an
hour
elapsed
before
the
tail
of
the
snake
came
into
view
and
a
rabble
of
unkempt
boys
closed
in
upon
it
filling
the
street
i
shall
go
to
the
window
mother
said
cyril
she
nodded
he
crept
out
of
the
bedroom
luke
square
was
a
sea
of
hats
and
memorial
cards
most
of
the
occupiers
of
the
square
had
hung
out
flags
at
and
a
flag
at
was
flying
over
the
town
hall
in
the
distance
sightseers
were
at
every
window
the
two
bands
had
united
at
the
top
of
the
square
and
behind
them
on
a
north
staffordshire
railway
lorry
stood
the
rector
and
several
black
figures
the
rector
was
speaking
but
only
those
close
to
the
lorry
could
hear
his
feeble
treble
voice
such
was
the
massive
protest
of
bursley
against
what
bursley
regarded
as
a
callous
injustice
the
execution
of
daniel
povey
had
most
genuinely
excited
the
indignation
of
the
town
that
execution
was
not
only
an
injustice
it
was
an
insult
a
humiliating
snub
and
the
worst
was
that
the
rest
of
the
country
had
really
discovered
no
sympathetic
interest
in
the
affair
certain
london
papers
indeed
in
commenting
casually
on
the
execution
had
slurred
the
morals
and
manners
of
the
five
towns
professing
to
regard
the
district
as
notoriously
beyond
the
realm
of
the
ten
commandments
this
had
helped
to
render
furious
the
townsmen
this
as
much
as
anything
had
encouraged
the
spontaneous
outburst
of
feeling
which
had
culminated
in
a
luke
square
full
of
people
with
memorial
cards
in
their
hats
the
demonstration
had
scarcely
been
organized
it
had
somehow
organized
itself
employing
the
places
of
worship
and
a
few
clubs
as
centres
of
gathering
and
it
proved
an
immense
success
there
were
seven
or
eight
thousand
people
in
the
square
and
the
pity
was
that
england
as
a
whole
could
not
have
had
a
glimpse
of
the
spectacle
since
the
execution
of
the
elephant
nothing
had
so
profoundly
agitated
bursley
constance
who
left
the
bedroom
momentarily
for
the
reflected
that
the
death
and
burial
of
cyril
honoured
grandfather
though
a
resounding
event
had
not
caused
of
the
stir
which
she
beheld
but
then
john
baines
had
killed
nobody
the
rector
spoke
too
long
every
one
felt
that
but
at
length
he
finished
the
bands
performed
the
doxology
and
the
immense
multitudes
began
to
disperse
by
the
eight
streets
that
radiate
from
the
square
at
the
same
time
one
struck
and
the
opened
with
their
customary
admirable
promptitude
respectable
persons
of
course
ignored
the
and
hastened
homewards
to
a
delayed
dinner
but
in
a
town
of
over
thirty
thousand
souls
there
are
sufficient
dregs
to
fill
all
the
on
an
occasion
of
ceremonial
excitement
constance
saw
the
bar
of
the
vaults
crammed
with
individuals
whose
sense
of
decent
fitness
was
imperfect
the
barman
and
the
landlord
and
the
principal
members
of
the
landlord
family
were
hard
put
to
it
to
quench
that
funereal
thirst
constance
as
she
ate
a
little
meal
in
the
bedroom
could
not
but
witness
the
orgy
a
bandsman
with
his
silver
instrument
was
prominent
at
the
counter
at
five
minutes
to
three
the
vaults
spewed
forth
a
squirt
of
roysterers
who
walked
on
the
pavement
as
on
a
among
them
was
the
bandsman
his
silver
instrument
only
half
enveloped
in
its
bag
of
green
serge
he
established
an
equilibrium
in
the
gutter
it
would
not
have
mattered
so
seriously
if
he
had
not
been
a
bandsman
the
barman
and
the
landlord
pushed
the
ultimate
sot
by
force
into
the
street
and
bolted
the
door
till
six
just
as
a
policeman
strolled
along
the
first
policeman
of
the
day
it
became
known
that
similar
scenes
were
enacting
at
the
thresholds
of
other
inns
and
the
judicious
were
sad
vi
when
the
altercation
between
the
policeman
and
the
musician
in
the
gutter
was
at
its
height
samuel
povey
became
restless
but
since
he
had
scarcely
stirred
through
the
performances
of
the
bands
it
was
probably
not
the
cries
of
the
drunkard
that
had
aroused
him
he
had
shown
very
little
interest
in
the
preliminaries
of
the
great
demonstration
the
flame
of
his
passion
for
the
case
of
daniel
povey
seemed
to
have
shot
up
on
the
day
before
the
execution
and
then
to
have
expired
on
that
day
he
went
to
stafford
in
order
by
permit
of
the
prison
governor
to
see
his
cousin
for
the
last
time
his
condition
then
was
undoubtedly
not
far
removed
from
monomania
was
the
conventional
expression
which
frequently
rose
in
constance
mind
as
a
description
of
the
mind
of
her
husband
but
she
fought
it
down
she
would
not
have
it
it
was
too
crude
with
its
associations
she
would
only
admit
that
the
case
had
on
his
mind
a
startling
proof
of
this
was
that
he
actually
suggested
taking
cyril
with
him
to
see
the
condemned
man
he
wished
cyril
to
see
daniel
he
said
gravely
that
he
thought
cyril
ought
to
see
him
the
proposal
was
monstrous
inexplicable
or
explicable
only
by
the
assumption
that
his
mind
while
not
unhinged
had
temporarily
lost
its
balance
constance
opposed
an
absolute
negative
and
samuel
being
in
every
way
enfeebled
she
overcame
as
for
cyril
he
was
divided
between
fear
and
curiosity
on
the
whole
perhaps
cyril
regretted
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
say
at
school
that
he
had
had
speech
with
the
most
celebrated
killer
of
the
age
on
the
day
before
his
execution
samuel
returned
hysterical
from
stafford
his
account
of
the
scene
which
he
gave
in
a
very
loud
voice
was
a
most
absurd
and
yet
pathetic
recital
obviously
distorted
by
memory
when
he
came
to
the
point
of
the
entrance
of
dick
povey
who
was
still
at
the
hospital
and
who
had
been
specially
driven
to
stafford
and
carried
into
the
prison
he
wept
without
restraint
his
hysteria
was
painful
in
a
very
high
degree
he
went
to
bed
of
his
own
accord
for
his
cough
had
improved
again
and
on
the
following
day
the
day
of
the
execution
he
remained
in
bed
till
the
afternoon
in
the
evening
the
rector
sent
for
him
to
the
rectory
to
discuss
the
proposed
demonstration
on
the
next
day
saturday
he
said
he
should
not
get
up
icy
showers
were
sweeping
the
town
and
his
cough
was
worse
after
the
evening
visit
to
the
rector
constance
had
no
apprehensions
about
him
the
most
dangerous
part
of
the
winter
was
over
and
there
was
nothing
now
to
force
him
into
indiscretions
she
said
to
herself
calmly
that
he
should
stay
in
bed
as
long
as
he
liked
that
he
could
not
have
too
much
repose
after
the
cruel
fatigues
physical
and
spiritual
which
he
had
suffered
his
cough
was
short
but
not
as
troublesome
as
in
the
past
his
face
flushed
dusky
and
settled
in
gloom
and
he
was
slightly
feverish
with
quick
pulse
and
quick
breathing
the
symptoms
of
a
renewed
cold
he
passed
a
wakeful
night
broken
by
brief
dreams
in
which
he
talked
at
dawn
he
had
some
hot
food
asked
what
day
it
was
frowned
and
seemed
to
doze
off
at
once
at
eleven
he
had
refused
food
and
he
had
intermittently
dozed
during
the
progress
of
the
demonstration
and
its
orgiastic
sequel
constance
had
food
ready
for
his
waking
and
she
approached
the
bed
and
leaned
over
him
the
fever
had
increased
somewhat
the
breathing
was
more
rapid
and
his
lips
were
covered
with
tiny
purple
pimples
he
feebly
shook
his
head
with
a
disgusted
air
at
her
mention
of
food
it
was
this
obstinate
refusal
of
food
which
first
alarmed
her
a
little
uncomfortable
suspicion
shot
up
in
her
surely
there
nothing
the
matter
with
him
something
impossible
to
say
what
caused
her
to
bend
still
lower
and
put
her
ear
to
his
chest
she
heard
within
that
mysterious
box
a
rapid
succession
of
thin
dry
crackling
sounds
sounds
such
as
she
would
have
produced
by
rubbing
her
hair
between
her
fingers
close
to
her
ear
the
crepitation
ceased
then
recommenced
and
she
perceived
that
it
coincided
with
the
intake
of
his
breath
he
coughed
the
sounds
were
intensified
a
spasm
of
pain
ran
over
his
face
and
he
put
his
damp
hand
to
his
side
pain
in
my
side
he
whispered
with
difficulty
constance
stepped
into
the
where
cyril
was
sketching
by
the
fire
cyril
she
said
go
across
and
ask
harrop
to
come
round
at
once
and
if
he
is
in
then
his
new
partner
is
it
for
father
yes
what
the
matter
now
do
as
i
say
please
said
constance
sharply
adding
i
know
what
the
matter
perhaps
nothing
but
i
not
satisfied
the
venerable
harrop
pronounced
the
word
it
was
acute
double
pneumonia
that
samuel
had
got
during
the
three
worst
months
of
the
year
he
had
escaped
the
fatal
perils
which
await
a
man
with
a
flat
chest
and
a
chronic
cough
who
ignores
his
condition
and
defies
the
weather
but
a
journey
of
five
hundred
yards
to
the
rectory
had
been
one
journey
too
many
the
rectory
was
so
close
to
the
shop
that
he
had
not
troubled
to
wrap
himself
up
as
for
an
excursion
to
stafford
he
survived
the
crisis
of
the
disease
and
then
died
of
toxsemia
caused
by
a
heart
that
would
not
do
its
duty
by
the
blood
a
casual
death
scarce
noticed
in
the
reaction
after
the
great
febrile
demonstration
besides
samuel
povey
never
could
impose
himself
on
the
burgesses
he
lacked
individuality
he
was
little
i
have
often
laughed
at
samuel
povey
but
i
liked
and
respected
him
he
was
a
very
honest
man
i
have
always
been
glad
to
think
that
at
the
end
of
his
life
destiny
took
hold
of
him
and
displayed
to
the
observant
the
vein
of
greatness
which
runs
through
every
soul
without
exception
he
embraced
a
cause
lost
it
and
died
of
it
chapter
vi
the
widow

constance
alone
in
the
parlour
stood
expectant
by
the
set
she
was
not
wearing

her

the
death
of

talked

disadvantages

had
worn
them
unwillingly
and
only
because
a
public
opinion
not
sufficiently
advanced
had
intimidated
her
constance
had
said
if
ever
i
a
widow
i
wo
wear
them
positively
in
the
tone
of
youth
and
baines
had
replied
i
hope
you
wo
my
dear
that
was
over
twenty
years
ago
but
constance
perfectly
remembered
and
now
she
was
a
widow
how
strange
and
how
impressive
was
life
and
she
had
kept
her
word
not
positively
not
without
hesitations
for
though
times
were
changed
bursley
was
still
bursley
but
she
had
kept
it
this
was
the
first
monday
after
samuel
funeral
existence
in
the
house
had
been
resumed
on
the
plane
which
would
henceforth
be
the
normal
plane
constance
had
put
on
for
tea
a
dress
of
black
silk
with
a
jet
brooch
of
her
mother
her
hands
just
meticulously
washed
had
that
feeling
of
being
dirty
which
comes
from
roughening
of
the
epidermis
caused
by
a
day
spent
in
fingering
stuffs
she
had
been
through
samuel
things
and
her
own
and
ranging
all
anew
it
was
astonishing
how
little
the
man
had
collected
of
in
the
course
of
over
half
a
century
all
his
clothes
were
contained
in
two
long
drawers
and
a
short
one
he
had
the
least
possible
quantity
of
haberdashery
and
linen
for
he
invariably
took
from
the
shop
such
articles
as
he
required
when
he
required
them
and
he
would
never
preserve
what
was
done
with
he
possessed
no
jewellery
save
a
set
of
gold
studs
a
and
a
the
was
buried
with
him
once
when
constance
had
offered
him
her
father
gold
watch
and
chain
he
had
politely
refused
it
saying
that
he
preferred
his
own
a
silver
watch
with
a
black
cord
which
kept
excellent
time
he
had
said
later
that
she
might
save
the
gold
watch
and
chain
for
cyril
when
he
was
beyond
these
trifles
and
a
box
of
cigars
and
a
pair
of
spectacles
he
left
nothing
personal
to
himself
some
men
leave
behind
them
a
litter
which
takes
months
to
sift
and
distribute
but
samuel
had
not
the
mania
for
owning
constance
put
his
clothes
in
a
box
to
be
given
away
gradually
all
except
an
overcoat
and
handkerchiefs
which
might
do
for
cyril
she
locked
up
the
watch
and
its
black
cord
the
spectacles
and
the
she
gave
the
gold
studs
to
cyril
she
climbed
on
a
chair
and
hid
the
on
the
top
of
her
wardrobe
and
scarce
a
trace
of
samuel
remained
by
his
own
wish
the
funeral
had
been
as
simple
and
private
as
possible
one
or
two
distant
relations
whom
constance
scarcely
knew
and
who
would
probably
not
visit
her
again
until
she
too
was
dead
came
and
went
and
lo
the
affair
was
over
the
simple
celerity
of
the
funeral
would
have
satisfied
even
samuel
whose
tremendous
hid
itself
so
effectually
behind
such
externals
that
nobody
had
ever
fully
perceived
it
not
even
constance
quite
knew
samuel
secret
opinion
of
samuel
constance
was
aware
that
he
had
a
ridiculous
side
that
his
greatest
lack
had
been
a
lack
of
spectacular
dignity
even
in
the
coffin
where
nevertheless
most
people
are
finally
effective
he
had
not
been
imposing
with
his
finicky
little
grey
beard
persistently
sticking
up
the
vision
of
him
in
his
coffin
there
in
the
churchyard
just
at
the
end
of
king
street
with
the
lid
screwed
down
on
that
unimportant
beard
recurred
frequently
in
the
mind
of
the
widow
as
something
untrue
and
misleading
she
had
to
say
to
herself
yes
he
is
really
there
and
that
is
why
i
have
this
particular
feeling
in
my
heart
she
saw
him
as
an
object
pathetic
and
wistful
not
majestic
and
yet
she
genuinely
thought
that
there
could
not
exist
another
husband
quite
so
honest
quite
so
just
quite
so
reliable
quite
so
good
as
samuel
had
been
what
a
conscience
he
had
how
he
would
try
and
try
to
be
fair
with
her
twenty
years
she
could
remember
of
ceaseless
constant
endeavour
on
his
part
to
behave
rightly
to
her
she
could
recall
many
an
occasion
when
he
had
obviously
checked
himself
striving
against
his
tendency
to
cold
abruptness
and
to
sullenness
in
order
to
give
her
the
respect
due
to
a
wife
what
loyalty
was
his
how
she
could
depend
on
him
how
much
better
he
was
than
herself
she
thought
with
modesty
his
death
was
an
amputation
for
her
but
she
faced
it
with
calmness
she
was
not
bowed
with
sorrow
she
did
not
nurse
the
idea
that
her
life
was
at
an
end
on
the
contrary
she
obstinately
put
it
away
from
her
dwelling
on
cyril
she
did
not
indulge
in
the
enervating
voluptuousness
of
grief
she
had
begun
in
the
first
hours
of
bereavement
by
picturing
herself
as
one
marked
out
for
the
blows
of
fate
she
had
lost
her
father
and
her
mother
and
now
her
husband
her
career
seemed
to
be
punctuated
by
interments
but
after
a
while
her
gentle
commonsense
came
to
insist
that
most
human
beings
lose
their
parents
and
that
every
marriage
must
end
in
either
a
widower
or
a
widow
and
that
all
careers
are
punctuated
by
interments
had
she
not
had
nearly
years
of
happy
married
life
years
rolled
up
the
sudden
thought
of
their
naive
ignorance
of
life
hers
and
his
when
they
were
first
married
brought
tears
into
her
eyes
how
wise
and
experienced
she
was
now
and
had
she
not
cyril
compared
to
many
women
she
was
indeed
very
fortunate
the
one
visitation
which
had
been
specially
hers
was
the
disappearance
of
sophia
and
yet
even
that
was
not
worse
than
the
death
outright
of
sophia
was
perhaps
not
so
bad
for
sophia
might
return
out
of
the
darkness
the
blow
of
sophia
flight
had
seemed
unique
when
it
was
fresh
and
long
afterwards
had
seemed
to
separate
the
baines
family
from
all
other
families
in
a
particular
shame
but
at
the
age
of
constance
had
learnt
that
such
events
are
not
uncommon
in
families
and
strange
sequels
to
them
not
unknown
thinking
often
of
sophia
she
hoped
wildly
and
frequently
she
looked
at
the
clock
she
had
a
little
spasm
of
nervousness
lest
cyril
might
fail
to
keep
his
word
on
that
first
day
of
their
new
regular
life
together
and
at
the
instant
he
burst
into
the
room
invading
it
like
an
armed
force
having
previously
laid
waste
the
shop
in
his
passage
i
not
late
mother
i
not
late
he
cried
proudly
she
smiled
warmly
happy
in
him
drawing
out
of
him
balm
and
solace
he
did
not
know
that
in
that
stout
familiar
body
before
him
was
a
sensitive
trembling
soul
that
clutched
at
him
ecstatically
as
the
one
reality
in
the
universe
he
did
not
know
that
that
evening
meal
partaken
of
without
hurry
after
school
had
released
him
to
her
was
to
be
the
ceremonial
sign
of
their
intimate
unity
and
their
interdependence
a
tender
and
delicious
proof
that
they
were
in
all
to
each
other
he
saw
only
his
tea
for
which
he
was
hungry
just
as
hungry
as
though
his
father
were
not
scarcely
yet
cold
in
the
grave
but
he
saw
obscurely
that
the
occasion
demanded
something
not
quite
ordinary
and
so
exerted
himself
to
be
boyishly
charming
to
his
mother
she
said
to
herself
good
he
was
he
felt
at
ease
and
confident
in
the
future
because
he
detected
beneath
her
customary
judicial
impartial
mask
a
clear
desire
to
spoil
him
after
tea
she
regretfully
left
him
at
his
in
order
to
go
into
the
shop
the
shop
was
the
great
unsolved
question
what
was
she
to
do
with
the
shop
was
she
to
continue
the
business
or
to
sell
it
with
the
fortunes
of
her
father
and
her
aunt
and
the
economies
of
twenty
years
she
had
more
than
sufficient
means
she
was
indeed
rich
according
to
the
standards
of
the
square
nay
wealthy
therefore
she
was
under
no
material
compulsion
to
keep
the
shop
moreover
to
keep
it
would
mean
personal
superintendence
and
the
burden
of
responsibility
from
which
her
calm
lethargy
shrank
on
the
other
hand
to
dispose
of
the
business
would
mean
the
breaking
of
ties
and
leaving
the
premises
and
from
this
also
she
shrank
young
lawton
without
being
asked
had
advised
her
to
sell
but
she
did
not
want
to
sell
she
wanted
the
impossible
that
matters
should
proceed
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
that
samuel
death
should
change
nothing
save
in
her
heart
in
the
meantime
miss
insull
was
priceless
constance
thoroughly
understood
one
side
of
the
shop
but
miss
insull
understood
both
and
the
finance
of
it
also
miss
insull
could
have
directed
the
establishment
with
credit
if
not
with
brilliance
she
was
indeed
directing
it
at
that
moment
constance
however
felt
jealous
of
miss
insull
she
was
conscious
of
a
slight
antipathy
towards
the
faithful
one
she
did
not
care
to
be
in
the
hands
of
miss
insull
there
were
one
or
two
customers
at
the
millinery
counter
they
greeted
her
with
a
deplorable
copiousness
of
tact
most
tactfully
they
avoided
any
reference
to
constance
loss
but
by
their
tone
their
glances
at
constance
and
at
each
other
and
their
heroically
restrained
sighs
they
spread
desolation
as
though
they
had
been
spreading
ashes
instead
of
butter
on
bread
the
assistants
too
had
a
special
demeanour
for
the
poor
lone
widow
which
was
excessively
trying
to
her
she
wished
to
be
natural
and
she
would
have
succeeded
had
they
not
all
of
them
apparently
conspired
together
to
make
her
task
impossible
she
moved
away
to
the
other
side
of
the
shop
to
samuel
desk
at
which
he
used
to
stand
staring
absently
out
of
the
little
window
into
king
street
while
murmurously
casting
figures
she
lighted
the
there
arranged
the
light
exactly
to
suit
her
and
then
lifted
the
large
flap
of
the
desk
and
drew
forth
some
account
books
miss
insull
she
called
in
a
low
clear
voice
with
a
touch
of
haughtiness
and
a
touch
of
command
in
it
the
pose
a
comical
contradiction
of
constance
benevolent
character
was
deliberately
adopted
it
illustrated
the
effects
of
jealousy
on
even
the
softest
disposition
miss
insull
responded
she
had
no
alternative
but
to
respond
and
she
gave
no
sign
of
resenting
her
employer
attitude
but
then
miss
insull
seldom
did
give
any
sign
of
being
human
the
customers
departed
one
after
another
obsequiously
sped
by
the
assistants
who
thereupon
lowered
the
gases
somewhat
according
to
secular
rule
and
in
the
dim
eclipse
as
they
restored
boxes
to
shelves
they
could
hear
the
tranquil
regular
conversation
of
the
two
women
at
the
desk
discussing
accounts
and
then
the
chink
of
gold
suddenly
there
was
an
irruption
one
of
the
assistants
sprang
instinctively
to
the
gas
but
on
perceiving
that
the
disturber
of
peace
was
only
a
slatternly
girl
hatless
and
imperfectly
clean
she
decided
to
leave
the
gas
as
it
was
and
put
on
a
condescending
suspicious
demeanour
if
you
please
can
i
speak
to
the
missis
said
the
girl
breathlessly
she
seemed
to
be
about
eighteen
years
of
age
fat
and
plain
her
blue
frock
was
torn
and
over
it
she
wore
a
rough
brown
apron
caught
up
at
one
corner
to
the
waist
her
bare
forearms
were
of
colour
what
is
it
demanded
the
assistant
miss
insull
looked
over
her
shoulder
across
the
shop
it
must
be
maggie
hollins
daughter
said
miss
insull
under
her
breath
what
can
she
want
said
constance
leaving
the
desk
instantly
and
to
the
girl
who
stood
sturdily
holding
her
own
against
the
group
of
assistants
you
are
hollins
daughter
are
you
yes
mum
what
your
name
maggie
mum
and
if
you
please
mother
sent
me
to
ask
if
kindly
give
her
a
funeral
card
a
funeral
card
yes
of
povey
she
been
expecting
of
one
and
she
thought
as
how
perhaps
you
forgotten
it
especially
as
she
was
asked
to
the
funeral
the
girl
stopped
constance
perceived
that
by
mere
negligence
she
had
seriously
wounded
the
feelings
of
maggie
senior
the
truth
was
she
had
never
thought
of
maggie
she
ought
to
have
remembered
that
funeral
cards
were
almost
the
sole
ornamentation
of
maggie
abominable
cottage
certainly
she
replied
after
a
pause
miss
insull
there
are
a
few
cards
left
in
the
desk
are
there
please
put
me
one
in
an
envelope
for
mrs
hollins
she
gave
the
heavily
bordered
envelope
to
the
ruddy
wench
who
enfolded
it
in
her
apron
and
with
hurried
shy
thanks
ran
off
tell
your
mother
i
send
her
a
card
with
pleasure
constance
called
after
the
girl
the
strangeness
of
the
hazards
of
life
made
her
thoughtful
she
to
whom
maggie
had
always
seemed
an
old
woman
was
a
widow
but
husband
survived
as
a
lusty
invalid
and
she
guessed
that
maggie
vilely
struggling
in
squalor
and
poverty
was
somehow
happy
in
her
frowsy
careless
way
she
went
back
to
the
accounts
dreaming
ii
when
the
shop
had
been
closed
under
her
own
critical
and
precise
superintendence
she
extinguished
the
last
gas
in
it
and
returned
to
the
parlour
wondering
where
she
might
discover
some
entirely
reliable
man
or
boy
to
deal
with
the
shutters
night
and
morning
samuel
had
ordinarily
dealt
with
the
shutters
himself
and
on
extraordinary
occasions
and
during
holidays
miss
insull
and
one
of
her
subordinates
had
struggled
with
their
unwieldiness
but
the
extraordinary
occasion
had
now
become
ordinary
and
miss
insull
could
not
be
expected
to
continue
indefinitely
in
the
functions
of
a
male
constance
had
a
mind
to
engage
an
a
luxury
against
which
samuel
had
always
set
his
face
she
did
not
dream
of
asking
the
herculean
cyril
to
open
and
shut
shop
he
had
apparently
finished
his
the
books
were
pushed
aside
and
he
was
sketching
in
on
a
to
the
right
of
the
fireplace
over
the
sofa
there
hung
an
engraving
after
landseer
showing
a
lonely
stag
paddling
into
a
lake
the
stag
at
eve
had
drunk
or
was
about
to
drink
his
fill
and
cyril
was
copying
him
he
had
already
indicated
a
flight
of
birds
in
the
middle
distance
vague
birds
on
the
wing
being
easier
than
detailed
stags
he
had
begun
with
the
birds
constance
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
finished
your
lessons
she
murmured
caressingly
before
speaking
cyril
gazed
up
at
the
picture
with
a
frowning
busy
expression
and
then
replied
in
an
voice
yes
and
after
a
pause
except
my
arithmetic
i
shall
do
that
in
the
morning
before
breakfast
oh
cyril
she
protested
it
had
been
a
positive
ordinance
for
a
long
time
past
that
there
should
be
no
sketching
until
lessons
were
done
in
his
lifetime
cyril
had
never
dared
to
break
it
he
bent
over
his
block
feigning
an
intense
absorption
hand
slipped
from
his
shoulder
she
wanted
to
command
him
formally
to
resume
his
lessons
but
she
could
not
she
feared
an
argument
she
mistrusted
herself
and
moreover
it
was
so
soon
after
his
death
you
know
you
wo
have
time
morning
she
said
weakly
oh
mother
he
retorted
superiorly
do
worry
and
then
in
a
cajoling
tone
i
wanted
to
do
that
stag
for
ages
she
sighed
and
sat
down
in
her
he
went
on
sketching
rubbing
out
and
making
queer
expostulatory
noises
against
his
pencil
or
against
the
difficulties
needlessly
invented
by
sir
edwin
landseer
once
he
rose
and
changed
the
position
of
the
staring
fiercely
at
the
engraving
as
though
it
had
committed
a
sin
amy
came
to
lay
the
supper
he
did
not
acknowledge
that
she
existed
now
master
cyril
after
you
with
that
table
if
you
please
she
announced
herself
brusquely
with
the
privilege
of
an
old
servant
and
a
woman
who
would
never
see
thirty
again
what
a
nuisance
you
are
amy
he
gruffly
answered
look
here
mother
ca
amy
lay
the
cloth
on
that
half
of
the
table
i
right
in
the
middle
of
my
drawing
there
plenty
of
room
there
for
two
he
seemed
not
to
be
aware
that
in
the
phrase
of
room
for
two
he
had
made
a
callous
reference
to
their
loss
the
fact
was
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
two
constance
said
quickly
very
well
amy
for
this
once
amy
grunted
but
obeyed
constance
had
to
summon
him
twice
from
art
to
nourishment
he
ate
with
rapidity
frequently
regarding
the
picture
with
searching
eyes
when
he
had
finished
he
refilled
his
glass
with
water
and
put
it
next
to
his
you
surely
are
thinking
of
beginning
to
paint
at
this
time
of
night
constance
exclaimed
astonished
oh
yes
mother
he
fretfully
appealed
it
not
late
another
positive
ordinance
of
his
father
had
been
that
there
should
be
nothing
after
supper
except
bed
nine
was
the
latest
permissible
moment
for
going
to
bed
it
was
now
less
than
a
quarter
to
it
only
wants
twelve
minutes
to
nine
constance
pointed
out
well
what
if
it
does
now
cyril
she
said
i
do
hope
you
are
going
to
be
a
good
boy
and
not
cause
your
mother
anxiety
but
she
said
it
too
kindly
he
said
sullenly
i
do
think
you
might
let
me
finish
it
i
begun
it
it
wo
take
me
long
she
made
the
mistake
of
leaving
the
main
point
how
can
you
possibly
choose
your
colours
properly
by
she
said
i
going
to
do
it
in
sepia
he
replied
in
triumph
it
must
occur
again
she
said
he
thanked
god
for
a
good
supper
and
sprang
to
the
harmonium
where
his
was
amy
cleared
away
constance
did
there
was
silence
the
clock
struck
nine
and
it
also
struck
nine
she
warned
him
repeatedly
at
ten
minutes
to
ten
she
said
persuasively
now
cyril
when
the
clock
strikes
ten
i
shall
really
put
the
gas
out
the
clock
struck
ten
half
a
mo
half
a
mo
he
cried
i
done
i
done
her
hand
was
arrested
another
four
minutes
elapsed
and
then
he
jumped
up
there
you
are
he
said
proudly
showing
her
the
block
and
all
his
gestures
were
full
of
grace
and
cajolery
yes
it
very
good
constance
said
rather
indifferently
i
do
believe
you
care
for
it
he
accused
her
but
with
a
bright
smile
i
care
for
your
health
she
said
just
look
at
that
clock
he
sat
down
in
the
other
deliberately
now
cyril
well
mother
i
suppose
you
let
me
take
my
boots
off
he
said
it
with
teasing
when
he
kissed
her
good
night
she
wanted
to
cling
to
him
so
affectionate
was
his
kiss
but
she
could
not
throw
off
the
habits
of
restraint
which
she
had
been
originally
taught
and
had
all
her
life
practised
she
keenly
regretted
the
inability
in
her
bedroom
alone
she
listened
to
his
movements
as
he
undressed
the
door
between
the
two
rooms
was
unlatched
she
had
to
control
a
desire
to
open
it
ever
so
little
and
peep
at
him
he
would
not
have
liked
that
he
could
have
enriched
her
heart
beyond
all
hope
and
at
no
cost
to
himself
but
he
did
not
know
his
power
as
she
could
not
cling
to
him
with
her
hands
she
clung
to
him
with
that
heart
of
hers
while
moving
sedately
up
and
down
the
room
alone
and
her
eyes
saw
him
through
the
solid
wood
of
the
door
at
last
she
got
heavily
into
bed
she
thought
with
placid
anxiety
in
the
dark
i
shall
have
to
be
firm
with
cyril
and
she
thought
also
simultaneously
he
really
must
be
a
good
boy
he
must
and
clung
to
him
passionately
without
shame
lying
alone
there
in
the
dark
she
could
be
as
unrestrained
and
girlish
as
her
heart
chose
when
she
loosed
her
hold
she
instantly
saw
the
father
arranged
in
his
coffin
or
flitting
about
the
room
then
she
would
hug
that
vision
too
for
the
pleasure
of
the
pain
it
gave
her
iii
she
was
reassured
as
to
cyril
during
the
next
few
days
he
did
not
attempt
to
repeat
his
ingenious
naughtiness
of
the
monday
evening
and
he
came
directly
home
for
tea
moreover
he
had
as
a
kind
of
miracle
performed
to
dazzle
her
actually
arisen
early
on
the
tuesday
morning
and
done
his
arithmetic
to
express
her
satisfaction
she
had
manufactured
a
specially
elaborate
for
the
sketch
after
sir
edwin
landseer
and
had
hung
it
in
her
bedroom
an
honour
which
cyril
appreciated
she
was
as
happy
as
a
woman
suffering
from
a
recent
amputation
can
be
and
compared
with
the
long
nightmare
created
by
samuel
monomania
and
illness
her
existence
seemed
to
be
now
a
beneficent
calm
cyril
she
thought
had
realized
the
importance
in
her
eyes
of
tea
of
that
evening
hour
and
that
companionship
which
were
for
her
the
flowering
of
the
day
and
she
had
such
confidence
in
his
goodness
that
she
would
pour
the
boiling
water
on
the
horniman
even
before
he
arrived
certainty
could
not
be
more
sure
and
then
on
the
friday
of
the
first
week
he
was
late
he
bounded
in
after
dark
and
the
state
of
his
clothes
indicated
too
clearly
that
he
had
been
playing
football
in
the
mud
that
was
a
grassy
field
in
summer
have
you
been
kept
in
my
boy
she
asked
for
the
sake
of
form
no
mother
he
said
casually
we
were
just
kicking
the
ball
about
a
bit
am
i
late
better
go
and
tidy
yourself
she
said
not
replying
to
his
question
you
ca
sit
down
in
that
state
and
i
have
some
fresh
tea
made
this
is
spoilt
oh
very
well
her
sacred
tea
the
institution
which
she
wanted
to
hallow
by
long
habit
and
which
was
to
count
before
everything
with
both
of
them
had
been
carelessly
sacrificed
to
the
kicking
of
a
football
in
mud
and
his
father
buried
not
ten
days
she
was
wounded
a
deep
clean
dangerous
wound
that
would
not
bleed
she
tried
to
be
glad
that
he
had
not
lied
he
might
easily
have
lied
saying
that
he
had
been
detained
for
a
fault
and
could
not
help
being
late
no
he
was
not
given
to
lying
he
would
lie
like
any
human
being
when
a
great
occasion
demanded
such
prudence
but
he
was
not
a
liar
he
might
fairly
be
called
a
truthful
boy
she
tried
to
be
glad
and
did
not
succeed
she
would
have
preferred
him
to
have
lied
amy
grumbling
had
to
boil
more
water
when
he
returned
to
the
parlour
superficially
cleaned
constance
expected
him
to
apologize
in
his
roundabout
boyish
way
at
any
rate
to
woo
and
wheedle
her
to
show
by
some
gesture
that
he
was
conscious
of
having
put
an
affront
on
her
but
his
attitude
was
quite
otherwise
his
attitude
was
rather
brusque
and
overbearing
and
noisy
he
ate
a
very
considerable
amount
of
jam
far
too
quickly
and
then
asked
for
more
in
a
tone
of
a
monarch
who
calls
for
his
own
and
ere
tea
was
finished
he
said
boldly
apropos
of
nothing
i
say
mother
you
just
have
to
let
me
go
to
the
school
of
art
after
easter
and
stared
at
her
with
a
fixed
challenge
in
his
eyes
he
meant
by
the
school
of
art
the
evening
classes
at
the
school
of
art
his
father
had
decided
absolutely
against
the
project
his
father
had
said
that
it
would
interfere
with
his
lessons
would
keep
him
up
too
late
at
night
and
involve
absence
from
home
in
the
evening
the
last
had
always
been
the
real
objection
his
father
had
not
been
able
to
believe
that
cyril
desire
to
study
art
sprang
purely
from
his
love
of
art
he
could
not
avoid
suspecting
that
it
was
a
plan
to
obtain
freedom
in
the
evenings
that
freedom
which
samuel
had
invariably
forbidden
in
all
cyril
suggestions
samuel
had
been
ready
to
detect
the
same
scheme
lurking
he
had
finally
said
that
when
cyril
left
school
and
took
to
a
vocation
then
he
could
study
art
at
night
if
he
chose
but
not
before
you
know
what
your
father
said
constance
replied
but
mother
that
all
very
well
i
sure
father
would
have
agreed
if
i
going
to
take
up
drawing
i
ought
to
do
it
at
once
that
what
the
says
and
i
suppose
he
ought
to
know
he
finished
on
a
tone
of
insolence
i
ca
allow
you
to
do
it
yet
said
constance
quietly
it
quite
out
of
the
question
quite
he
pouted
and
then
he
sulked
it
was
war
between
them
at
times
he
was
the
image
of
his
aunt
sophia
he
would
not
leave
the
subject
alone
but
he
would
not
listen
to
constance
reasoning
he
openly
accused
her
of
harshness
he
asked
her
how
she
could
expect
him
to
get
on
if
she
thwarted
him
in
his
most
earnest
desires
he
pointed
to
other
boys
whose
parents
were
wiser
it
all
very
fine
of
you
to
put
it
on
father
he
observed
sarcastically
he
gave
up
his
drawing
entirely
when
she
hinted
that
if
he
attended
the
school
of
art
she
would
be
condemned
to
solitary
evenings
he
looked
at
her
as
though
saying
well
and
if
you
are
he
seemed
to
have
no
heart
after
several
weeks
of
intense
unhappiness
she
said
how
many
evenings
do
you
want
to
go
the
war
was
over
he
was
charming
again
when
she
was
alone
she
could
cling
to
him
again
and
she
said
to
herself
if
we
can
be
happy
together
only
when
i
give
way
to
him
i
must
give
way
to
him
and
there
was
ecstasy
in
her
yielding
after
all
she
said
to
herself
perhaps
it
very
important
that
he
should
go
to
the
school
of
art
she
solaced
herself
with
such
thoughts
on
three
solitary
evenings
a
week
waiting
for
him
to
come
home
chapter
vii
bricks
and
mortar
i
in
the
summer
of
that
year
the
occurrence
of
a
white
rash
of
posters
on
hoardings
and
on
certain
houses
and
shops
was
symptomatic
of
organic
change
in
the
town
the
posters
were
iterations
of
a
mysterious
announcement
and
summons
which
began
with
the
august
words
by
order
of
the
trustees
of
the
late
william
clews
mericarp
esq
mericarp
had
been
a
considerable
owner
of
property
in
bursley
after
a
prolonged
residence
at
southport
he
had
died
at
the
age
of
leaving
his
property
behind
for
sixty
years
he
had
been
a
name
not
a
figure
and
the
news
of
his
death
which
was
assuredly
an
event
incited
the
burgesses
to
gossip
for
they
had
come
to
regard
him
as
one
of
the
invisible
immortals
constance
was
shocked
though
she
had
never
seen
mericarp
everybody
dies
nowadays
she
thought
he
owned
the
shop
and
also
critchlow
shop
constance
knew
not
how
often
her
father
and
later
her
husband
had
renewed
the
lease
of
those
premises
that
were
now
hers
but
from
her
earliest
recollections
rose
a
vague
memory
of
her
father
talking
to
her
mother
about
rent
which
was
and
always
had
been
a
hundred
a
year
mericarp
had
earned
the
reputation
of
being
good
landlord
constance
said
sadly
we
shall
never
have
another
as
good
when
a
lawyer
clerk
called
and
asked
her
to
permit
the
exhibition
of
a
poster
in
each
of
her
she
had
misgivings
for
the
future
she
was
worried
she
decided
that
she
would
determine
the
lease
next
year
so
as
to
be
on
the
safe
side
but
immediately
afterwards
she
decided
that
she
could
decide
nothing
the
posters
continued
to
be
sold
by
auction
at
the
tiger
hotel
at
for
seven
precisely
what
had
to
do
with
seven
precisely
no
one
knew
then
after
stating
the
name
and
credentials
of
the
auctioneer
the
posters
at
length
arrived
at
the
objects
to
be
sold
all
those
freehold
messuages
and
shops
and
copyhold
tenements
namely
houses
were
never
sold
by
auction
in
bursley
at
moments
of
auction
burgesses
were
reminded
that
the
erections
they
lived
in
were
not
houses
as
they
had
falsely
supposed
but
messuages
having
got
as
far
as
the
posters
ruled
a
line
and
began
afresh

and
at
present
in

povey
widow
under
a
lease
expiring
in
september
thus
clearly
asserting
that
all
constance
shop
was
for
sale
its
whole
entirety
and
not
a
fraction
or
slice
of
it
merely
the
posters
proceeded

in

county
of
stafford
and
at
present
in
the
occupation
of
charles
critchlow
chemist
under
an
agreement
for
a
yearly
tenancy
the
catalogue
ran
to
fourteen
lots
the
posters
lest
any
one
should
foolishly
imagine
that
a
intellect
could
have
achieved
such
explicit
and
comprehensive
clarity
of
statement
were
signed
by
a
powerful
firm
of
solicitors
in
hanbridge
happily
in
the
five
towns
there
were
no
metaphysicians
otherwise
the
firm
might
have
been
expected
to
explain
in
the
particulars
and
conditions
which
the
posters
promised
how
even
a
messuage
could
the
thing
at
which
it
was
within
a
few
hours
of
the
outbreak
of
the
rash
critchlow
abruptly
presented
himself
before
constance
at
the
millinery
counter
he
was
waving
a
poster
well
he
exclaimed
grimly
what
next
eh
yes
indeed
constance
responded
are
ye
thinking
o
buying
he
asked
all
the
assistants
including
miss
insull
were
in
hearing
but
he
ignored
their
presence
buying
repeated
constance
not
me
i
got
quite
enough
house
property
as
it
is
like
all
owners
of
real
property
she
usually
adopted
towards
her
possessions
an
attitude
implying
that
she
would
be
willing
to
pay
somebody
to
take
them
from
her
shall
you
she
added
with
critchlow
own
brusqueness
me
buy
property
in
luke
square
critchlow
sneered
and
then
left
the
shop
as
suddenly
as
he
had
entered
it
the
sneer
at
luke
square
was
his
characteristic
expression
of
an
opinion
which
had
been
slowly
forming
for
some
years
the
square
was
no
longer
what
it
had
been
though
individual
businesses
might
be
as
good
as
ever
for
nearly
twelve
months
two
shops
had
been
to
let
in
it
and
once
bankruptcy
had
stained
its
annals
the
tradesmen
had
naturally
searched
for
a
cause
in
every
direction
save
the
right
one
the
obvious
one
and
naturally
they
had
found
a
cause
according
to
the
tradesmen
the
cause
was
football
the
bursley
football
club
had
recently
swollen
into
a
genuine
rival
of
the
ancient
supremacy
of
the
celebrated
knype
club
it
had
transformed
itself
into
a
limited
company
and
rented
a
ground
up
the
moorthorne
road
and
built
a
grand
stand
the
bursley
had
with
the
knype
on
the
knype
ground
a
prodigious
achievement
an
achievement
which
occupied
a
column
of
the
athletic
news
one
monday
morning
but
were
the
tradesmen
civically
proud
of
this
glory
no
they
said
that
football
drew
people
out
of
the
town
on
saturday
afternoons
to
the
complete
abolition
of
shopping
they
said
also
that
people
thought
of
nothing
but
football
and
nearly
in
the
same
breath
that
only
roughs
and
could
possibly
be
interested
in
such
a
barbarous
game
and
they
spoke
of
gambling
and
professionalism
and
the
end
of
all
true
sport
in
england
in
brief
something
new
had
come
to
the
front
and
was
submitting
to
the
ordeal
of
the
curse
the
sale
of
the
mericarp
estate
had
a
particular
interest
for
respectable
persons
it
would
indicate
to
what
extent
if
at
all
football
was
ruining
bursley
constance
mentioned
to
cyril
that
she
fancied
she
might
like
to
go
to
the
sale
and
as
it
was
dated
for
one
of
cyril
cyril
said
that
he
fancied
he
might
like
to
go
too
so
they
went
together
samuel
used
to
attend
property
sales
but
he
had
never
taken
his
wife
to
one
constance
and
cyril
arrived
at
the
tiger
shortly
after
seven
and
were
directed
to
a
room
furnished
and
arranged
as
for
a
small
public
meeting
of
philanthropists
a
few
gentlemen
were
already
present
but
not
the
instigating
trustees
solicitors
and
auctioneers
it
appeared
that
for
seven
precisely
meant
constance
took
a
windsor
chair
in
the
corner
nearest
the
door
and
motioned
cyril
to
the
next
chair
they
dared
not
speak
they
moved
on
tiptoe
cyril
inadvertently
dragged
his
chair
along
the
floor
and
produced
a
scrunching
sound
he
blushed
as
though
he
had
desecrated
a
church
and
his
mother
made
a
gesture
of
horror
the
remainder
of
the
company
glanced
at
the
corner
apparently
pained
by
this
negligence
some
of
them
greeted
constance
but
with
a
sort
of
shamed
air
it
might
have
been
that
they
had
all
nefariously
gathered
together
there
for
the
committing
of
a
crime
fortunately
constance
widowhood
had
already
lost
its
touching
novelty
so
that
the
greetings
if
were
at
any
rate
given
without
unendurable
commiseration
and
did
not
cause
awkwardness
when
the
official
world
arrived
fussy
bustling
bearing
documents
and
a
hammer
the
general
feeling
of
guilty
shame
was
intensified
useless
for
the
auctioneer
to
try
to
dissipate
the
gloom
by
means
of
bright
gestures
and
quick
cheerful
remarks
to
his
supporters
cyril
had
an
idea
that
the
meeting
would
open
with
a
hymn
until
the
apparition
of
a
tapster
with
wine
showed
him
his
error
the
auctioneer
very
particularly
enjoined
the
tapster
to
see
to
it
that
no
one
lacked
for
his
thirst
and
the
tapster
became
energetic
he
began
by
choosing
constance
for
service
in
refusing
wine
she
blushed
then
the
fellow
offered
a
glass
to
cyril
who
went
scarlet
and
mumbled
with
a
lump
in
his
throat
when
the
tapster
back
was
turned
he
smiled
sheepishly
at
his
mother
the
majority
of
the
company
accepted
and
sipped
the
auctioneer
sipped
and
loudly
smacked
and
said
ah
critchlow
came
in
and
the
auctioneer
said
again
ah
i
always
glad
when
the
tenants
come
that
always
a
good
sign
he
glanced
round
for
approval
of
this
sentiment
but
everybody
seemed
too
stiff
to
move
even
the
auctioneer
was
waiter
offer
wine
to
mr
critchlow
he
exclaimed
bullyingly
as
if
saying
man
what
on
earth
are
you
thinking
of
to
neglect
mr
critchlow
yes
sir
yes
sir
said
the
waiter
who
was
dispensing
wine
as
fast
as
a
waiter
can
the
auction
commenced
seizing
the
hammer
the
auctioneer
gave
a
short
biography
of
william
clews
mericarp
and
this
pious
duty
accomplished
called
upon
a
solicitor
to
read
the
conditions
of
sale
the
solicitor
complied
and
made
a
distressing
exhibition
of
the
conditions
of
sale
were
very
lengthy
and
apparently
composed
in
a
foreign
tongue
and
the
audience
listened
to
this
elocution
with
a
stoical
pretence
of
breathless
interest
then
the
auctioneer
put
up
all
that
extensive
and
commodious
messuage
and
shop
situate
and
being
no
luke
square
constance
and
cyril
moved
their
limbs
surreptitiously
as
though
being
at
last
found
out
the
auctioneer
referred
to
john
baines
and
to
samuel
povey
with
a
sense
of
personal
loss
and
then
expressed
his
pleasure
in
the
presence
of
ladies
he
meant
constance
who
once
more
had
to
blush
now
gentlemen
said
the
auctioneer
what
do
you
say
for
these
famous
premises
i
think
i
do
not
exaggerate
when
i
use
the
word
some
one
said
a
thousand
pounds
in
the
terrorized
voice
of
a
delinquent
a
thousand
pounds
repeated
the
auctioneer
paused
sipped
and
smacked
guineas
said
another
voice
of
iniquity
a
thousand
and
fifty
said
the
auctioneer
then
there
was
a
long
interval
an
interval
that
tightened
the
nerves
of
the
assembly
now
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
auctioneer
adjured
the
first
voice
said
sulkily
eleven
hundred
and
thus
the
bids
rose
to
fifteen
hundred
lifted
bit
by
bit
as
it
were
by
the
magnetic
force
of
the
auctioneer
personality
the
man
was
now
standing
up
in
domination
he
bent
down
to
the
head
they
whispered
together
gentlemen
said
the
auctioneer
i
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
the
sale
is
now
open
his
tone
translated
better
than
words
his
calm
professional
beatitude
suddenly
in
a
voice
of
wrath
he
hissed
at
the
waiter
waiter
why
do
you
serve
these
gentlemen
yes
sir
yes
sir
the
auctioneer
sat
down
and
sipped
at
leisure
chatting
with
his
clerk
and
the
solicitor
and
the
solicitor
clerk
when
he
rose
it
was
as
a
conqueror
gentlemen
fifteen
hundred
is
bid
now
mr
critchlow
critchlow
shook
his
head
the
auctioneer
threw
a
courteous
glance
at
constance
who
avoided
it
after
many
adjurations
he
reluctantly
raised
his
hammer
pretended
to
let
it
fall
and
saved
it
several
times
and
then
critchlow
said
and
fifty
fifteen
hundred
and
fifty
is
bid
the
auctioneer
informed
the
company
electrifying
the
waiter
once
more
and
when
he
had
sipped
he
said
with
feigned
sadness
come
gentlemen
you
surely
do
mean
to
let
this
magnificent
lot
go
for
fifteen
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
but
they
did
mean
that
the
hammer
fell
and
the
auctioneer
clerk
and
the
solicitor
clerk
took
critchlow
aside
and
wrote
with
him
nobody
was
surprised
when
critchlow
bought
lot
no
his
own
shop
constance
whispered
then
to
cyril
that
she
wished
to
leave
they
left
with
unnatural
precautions
but
instantly
regained
their
natural
demeanour
in
the
dark
street
well
i
never
well
i
never
she
murmured
outside
astonished
and
disturbed
she
hated
the
prospect
of
critchlow
as
a
landlord
and
yet
she
could
not
persuade
herself
to
leave
the
place
in
spite
of
decisions
the
sale
demonstrated
that
football
had
not
entirely
undermined
the
commercial
basis
of
society
in
bursley
only
two
lots
had
to
be
withdrawn
ii
on
thursday
afternoon
of
the
same
week
the
youth
whom
constance
had
ended
by
hiring
for
the
manipulation
of
shutters
and
other
jobs
unsuitable
for
fragile
women
was
closing
the
shop
the
clock
had
struck
two
all
the
shutters
were
up
except
the
last
one
in
the
midst
of
the
doorway
miss
insull
and
her
mistress
were
walking
about
the
darkened
interior
putting
well
over
the
edges
of
exposed
goods
the
other
assistants
had
just
left
the
had
wandered
into
the
shop
as
he
almost
invariably
did
at
closing
time
for
he
slept
there
an
efficient
guard
and
had
lain
down
by
the
dying
stove
though
not
venerable
he
was
stiffening
into
age
you
can
shut
said
miss
insull
to
the
youth
but
as
the
final
shutter
was
ascending
to
its
position
critchlow
appeared
on
the
pavement
hold
on
young
fellow
critchlow
commanded
and
stepped
slowly
lifting
up
his
long
apron
over
the
horizontal
shutter
on
which
the
perpendicular
shutters
rested
in
the
doorway
shall
you
be
long
mr
critchlow
the
youth
asked
posing
the
shutter
or
am
i
to
shut
shut
lad
said
critchlow
briefly
i
go
out
by
th
side
door
here
mr
critchlow
miss
insull
called
out
to
constance
in
a
peculiar
tone
and
a
flush
scarcely
perceptible
crept
very
slowly
over
her
dark
features
in
the
twilight
of
the
shop
lit
only
by
a
few
starry
holes
in
the
shutters
and
by
the
small
not
the
keenest
eye
could
have
detected
that
flush
mr
critchlow
constance
murmured
the
exclamation
she
resented
his
future
ownership
of
her
shop
she
thought
he
was
come
to
play
the
landlord
and
she
determined
to
let
him
see
that
her
mood
was
independent
and
free
that
she
would
as
lief
give
up
the
business
as
keep
it
in
particular
she
meant
to
accuse
him
of
having
deliberately
deceived
her
as
to
his
intentions
on
his
previous
visit
well
missis
the
aged
man
greeted
her
we
made
it
up
between
us
happen
some
folk
think
we
taken
our
time
but
i
do
know
as
that
their
affair
his
little
blinking
eyes
had
a
red
border
the
skin
of
his
pale
small
face
was
wrinkled
in
millions
of
minute
creases
his
arms
and
legs
were
marvellously
thin
and
sharply
angular
the
corners
of
his
heliotrope
lips
were
turned
down
as
usual
in
a
mysterious
comment
on
the
world
and
his
smile
as
he
fronted
constance
with
his
excessive
height
crowned
the
mystery
constance
stared
at
a
loss
it
surely
could
not
after
all
be
true
the
substance
of
the
rumours
that
had
floated
like
vapours
in
the
square
for
eight
years
and
more
what
she
began
me
and
her
he
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
miss
insull
the
dog
had
leisurely
strolled
forward
to
inspect
the
edges
of
the
fiance
trousers
miss
insull
summoned
the
animal
with
a
noise
of
fingers
and
then
bent
down
and
caressed
it
a
strange
gesture
proving
the
validity
of
charles
critchlow
discovery
that
in
maria
insull
a
human
being
was
buried
miss
insull
was
as
near
as
any
one
could
guess
forty
years
of
age
for
years
she
had
served
in
the
shop
passing
about
twelve
hours
a
day
in
the
shop
attending
regularly
at
least
three
religious
services
at
the
wesleyan
chapel
or
school
on
sundays
and
sleeping
with
her
mother
whom
she
kept
she
had
never
earned
more
than
thirty
shillings
a
week
and
yet
her
situation
was
considered
to
be
exceptionally
good
in
the
eternal
fusty
dusk
of
the
shop
she
had
gradually
lost
such
sexual
characteristics
and
charms
as
she
had
once
possessed
she
was
as
thin
and
flat
as
charles
critchlow
himself
it
was
as
though
her
bosom
had
suffered
from
a
prolonged
drought
at
a
susceptible
period
of
development
and
had
never
recovered
the
one
proof
that
blood
ran
in
her
veins
was
the
pimply
quality
of
her
ruined
complexion
and
the
pimples
of
that
brickish
expanse
proved
that
the
blood
was
thin
and
bad
her
hands
and
feet
were
large
and
ungainly
the
skin
of
the
fingers
was
roughened
by
coarse
contacts
to
the
texture
of
on
six
days
a
week
she
wore
black
on
the
seventh
a
kind
of
discreet
she
was
honest
capable
and
industrious
and
beyond
the
confines
of
her
occupation
she
had
no
curiosity
no
intelligence
no
ideas
superstitions
and
prejudices
deep
and
violent
served
her
for
ideas
but
she
could
incomparably
sell
silks
and
bonnets
braces
and
oilcloth
in
widths
lengths
and
prices
she
never
erred
she
never
annoyed
a
customer
nor
foolishly
promised
what
could
not
be
performed
nor
was
late
nor
negligent
nor
disrespectful
no
one
knew
anything
about
her
because
there
was
nothing
to
know
subtract
the
from
her
and
naught
remained
benighted
and
spiritually
dead
she
existed
by
habit
but
for
charles
critchlow
she
happened
to
be
an
illusion
he
had
cast
eyes
on
her
and
had
seen
youth
innocence
virginity
during
eight
years
the
moth
charles
had
flitted
round
the
lamp
of
her
brilliance
and
was
now
singed
past
escape
he
might
treat
her
with
what
casualness
he
chose
he
might
ignore
her
in
public
he
might
talk
brutally
about
women
he
might
leave
her
to
wonder
dully
what
he
meant
for
months
at
a
stretch
but
there
emerged
indisputable
from
the
sum
of
his
conduct
the
fact
that
he
wanted
her
he
desired
her
she
charmed
him
she
was
something
ornamental
and
luxurious
for
which
he
was
ready
to
pay
and
to
commit
follies
he
had
been
a
widower
since
before
she
was
born
to
him
she
was
a
slip
of
a
girl
all
is
relative
in
this
world
as
for
her
she
was
too
indifferent
to
refuse
him
why
refuse
him
oysters
do
not
refuse
i
sure
i
congratulate
you
both
constance
breathed
realizing
the
import
of
critchlow
laconic
words
i
sure
i
hope
you
be
happy
that
be
all
right
said
critchlow
thank
you
povey
said
maria
insull
nobody
seemed
to
know
what
to
say
next
it
rather
sudden
was
on
constance
tongue
but
did
not
achieve
utterance
being
patently
absurd
ah
exclaimed
critchlow
as
though
himself
contemplating
anew
the
situation
miss
insull
gave
the
dog
a
final
pat
so
that
settled
said
critchlow
now
missis
ye
want
to
give
up
this
shop
do
ye
i
not
so
sure
about
that
constance
answered
uneasily
do
tell
me
he
protested
of
course
ye
want
to
give
up
the
shop
i
lived
here
all
my
life
said
constance
ye
not
lived
in
th
shop
all
ye
life
i
said
th
shop
listen
here
he
continued
i
got
a
proposal
to
make
to
you
you
can
keep
on
the
house
and
i
take
the
shop
off
ye
hands
now
he
looked
at
her
inquiringly
constance
was
taken
aback
by
the
brusqueness
of
the
suggestion
which
moreover
she
did
not
understand
but
how
she
faltered
come
here
said
critchlow
impatiently
and
he
moved
towards
the
of
the
shop
behind
the
till
come
where
what
do
you
want
constance
demanded
in
a
maze
here
said
critchlow
with
increasing
impatience
follow
me
will
ye
constance
obeyed
miss
insull
sidled
after
constance
and
the
dog
after
miss
insull
critchlow
went
through
the
doorway
and
down
the
corridor
past
the
room
to
his
right
the
corridor
then
turned
at
a
to
the
left
and
ended
at
the
parlour
door
the
kitchen
steps
being
to
the
left
critchlow
stopped
short
of
the
kitchen
steps
and
extended
his
arms
touching
the
walls
on
either
side
here
he
said
tapping
the
walls
with
his
bony
knuckles
here
suppose
i
brick
ye
this
up
and
th
same
upstairs
between
th
showroom
and
th
bedroom
passage
ye
got
your
house
to
yourself
ye
say
lived
here
all
your
life
well
what
to
prevent
ye
finishing
up
here
the
fact
is
he
added
it
would
only
be
making
into
two
houses
again
what
was
two
houses
to
start
with
afore
your
time
missis
and
what
about
the
shop
cried
constance
ye
can
sell
us
th
stock
at
a
valuation
constance
suddenly
comprehended
the
scheme
critchlow
would
remain
the
chemist
while
critchlow
became
the
head
of
the
chief
drapery
business
in
the
town
doubtless
they
would
knock
a
hole
through
the
separating
wall
on
the
other
side
to
balance
the
on
this
side
they
must
have
thought
it
all
out
in
detail
constance
revolted
yes
she
said
a
little
disdainfully
and
my
goodwill
shall
you
take
that
at
a
valuation
too
critchlow
glanced
at
the
creature
for
whom
he
was
ready
to
scatter
thousands
of
pounds
she
might
have
been
a
phryne
and
he
the
infatuated
fool
he
glanced
at
her
as
if
to
say
we
expected
this
and
this
is
where
we
agreed
it
was
to
stop
ay
he
said
to
constance
show
me
your
goodwill
lap
it
up
in
a
bit
of
paper
and
hand
it
over
and
i
take
it
at
a
valuation
but
not
afore
missis
not
afore
i
making
ye
a
very
good
offer
twenty
pound
a
year
i
let
ye
th
house
for
and
take
th
stock
at
a
valuation
think
it
over
my
lass
having
said
what
he
had
to
say
charles
critchlow
departed
according
to
his
custom
he
unceremoniously
let
himself
out
by
the
side
door
and
passed
with
wavy
apron
round
the
corner
of
king
street
into
the
square
and
so
to
his
own
shop
which
ignored
the
thursday
miss
insull
left
soon
afterwards
iii
constance
pride
urged
her
to
refuse
the
offer
but
in
truth
her
sole
objection
to
it
was
that
she
had
not
thought
of
the
scheme
herself
for
the
scheme
really
reconciled
her
wish
to
remain
where
she
was
with
her
wish
to
be
free
of
the
shop
i
shall
make
him
put
me
in
a
new
window
in
the
parlour
one
that
will
open
she
said
positively
to
cyril
who
accepted
critchlow
idea
with
fatalistic
indifference
after
stipulating
for
the
new
window
she
closed
with
the
offer
then
there
was
the
which
endured
for
weeks
and
then
a
carpenter
came
and
measured
for
the
window
and
a
builder
and
a
mason
came
and
inspected
doorways
and
constance
felt
that
the
end
was
upon
her
she
took
up
the
carpet
in
the
parlour
and
protected
the
furniture
by
dustsheets
she
and
cyril
lived
between
bare
boards
and
dustsheets
for
twenty
days
and
neither
carpenter
nor
mason
reappeared
then
one
surprising
day
the
old
window
was
removed
by
the
carpenter
two
journeymen
and
late
in
the
afternoon
the
carpenter
brought
the
new
window
and
the
three
men
worked
till
ten
at
night
fixing
it
cyril
wore
his
cap
and
went
to
bed
in
his
cap
and
constance
wore
a
paisley
shawl
a
painter
had
bound
himself
beyond
all
possibility
of
failure
to
paint
the
window
on
the
morrow
he
was
to
begin
at
six
and
amy
was
altered
so
that
she
might
be
up
and
dressed
to
admit
him
he
came
a
week
later
administered
one
coat
and
vanished
for
another
ten
days
then
two
masons
suddenly
came
with
heavy
tools
and
were
shocked
to
find
that
all
was
not
prepared
for
them
after
three
carpetless
weeks
constance
had
relaid
her
floors
they
tore
off
sent
cascades
of
plaster
down
the
kitchen
steps
withdrew
alternate
courses
of
bricks
from
the
walls
and
sated
with
destruction
hastened
away
after
four
days
new
red
bricks
began
to
arrive
carried
by
a
quite
guiltless
hodman
who
had
not
visited
the
house
before
the
hodman
met
the
full
storm
of
constance
wrath
it
was
not
a
vicious
wrath
rather
a
wrath
but
it
impressed
the
hodman
my
house
has
been
fit
to
live
in
for
a
month
she
said
in
fine
if
these
walls
are
built
upstairs
and
down
mind
do
let
any
of
you
dare
to
show
your
noses
here
again
for
i
wo
have
you
now
you
brought
your
bricks
off
with
you
and
tell
your
master
what
i
say
it
was
effective
the
next
day
subdued
and
plausible
workmen
of
all
sorts
awoke
the
house
with
knocking
at
precisely
and
the
two
doorways
were
slowly
bricked
up
the
curious
thing
was
that
when
the
barrier
was
already
a
foot
high
on
the
constance
remembered
small
possessions
of
her
own
which
she
had
omitted
to
remove
from
the
room
picking
up
her
skirts
she
stepped
over
into
the
region
that
was
no
more
hers
and
stepped
back
with
the
goods
she
had
a
bandanna
round
her
head
to
keep
the
thick
dust
out
of
her
hair
she
was
very
busy
very
preoccupied
with
nothings
she
had
no
time
for
sentimentalities
yet
when
the
men
arrived
at
the
topmost
course
and
were
at
last
hidden
behind
their
own
erection
and
she
could
see
only
rough
bricks
and
mortar
she
was
disconcertingly
overtaken
by
a
misty
blindness
and
could
not
even
see
bricks
and
mortar
cyril
found
her
with
her
absurd
bandanna
weeping
in
a
in
the
sacked
parlour
he
whistled
uneasily
remarked
i
say
mother
what
about
tea
and
then
hearing
the
heavy
voices
of
workmen
above
ran
with
relief
upstairs
tea
had
been
set
in
the
he
was
glad
to
learn
that
from
amy
who
informed
him
also
that
she
should
get
used
to
them
there
new
walls
not
as
long
as
she
lived
he
went
to
the
school
of
art
that
night
constance
alone
could
find
nothing
to
do
she
had
willed
that
the
walls
should
be
built
and
they
had
been
built
but
days
must
elapse
before
they
could
be
plastered
and
after
the
plaster
still
more
days
before
the
papering
not
for
another
month
perhaps
would
her
house
be
free
of
workmen
and
ripe
for
her
own
labours
she
could
only
sit
in
the
and
contemplate
the
havoc
of
change
and
keep
her
eyes
as
dry
as
she
could
the
legal
transactions
were
all
but
complete
little
bills
announcing
the
transfer
of
the
business
lay
on
the
counters
in
the
shop
at
the
disposal
of
customers
in
two
days
charles
critchlow
would
pay
the
price
of
a
desire
realized
the
sign
was
painted
out
and
new
letters
sketched
thereon
in
chalk
in
future
she
would
be
compelled
if
she
wished
to
enter
the
shop
to
enter
it
as
a
customer
and
from
the
front
yes
she
saw
that
though
the
house
remained
hers
the
root
of
her
life
had
been
wrenched
up
and
the
mess
it
seemed
inconceivable
that
the
material
mess
could
ever
be
straightened
away
yet
ere
the
fields
of
the
county
were
first
covered
with
snow
that
season
only
one
sign
survived
of
the
devastating
revolution
and
that
was
a
loose
sheet
of
that
had
been
too
soon
pasted
on
to
new
plaster
and
would
not
stick

maria
critchlow
constance
had
been
out
into
the
square
and
seen
the
altered
sign
and
seen
critchlow
taste
in
and
seen
most
impressive
sight
of
all
that
the
grimy
window
of
the
abandoned
room
at
the
top
of
the
abandoned
staircase
next
to
the
bedroom
of
her
girlhood
had
been
cleaned
and
a
table
put
in
front
of
it
she
knew
that
the
chamber
which
she
herself
had
never
entered
was
to
be
employed
as
a
storeroom
but
the
visible
proof
of
its
conversion
so
strangely
affected
her
that
she
had
not
felt
able
to
go
boldly
into
the
shop
as
she
had
meant
to
do
and
make
a
few
purchases
in
the
way
of
friendliness
i
a
silly
woman
she
muttered
later
she
did
venture
timidly
abrupt
into
the
shop
and
was
received
with
fitting
state
by
critchlow
as
desiccated
as
ever
who
insisted
on
allowing
her
the
special
trade
discount
and
she
carried
her
little
friendly
purchases
round
to
her
own
door
in

street
trivial
trivial
event
constance
not
knowing
whether
to
laugh
or

did
both
she
accused
herself
of
developing

hysterical
faculty
in
tears
and
strove
sagely

chapter
viii
the
proudest
mother
i
in
the
year
there
was
a
new
and
strange
man
living
at
no
luke
square
many
people
remarked
on
the
phenomenon
very
few
of
his
like
had
ever
been
seen
in
bursley
before
one
of
the
striking
things
about
him
was
the
complex
way
in
which
he
secured
himself
by
means
of
glittering
chains
a
chain
stretched
across
his
waistcoat
passing
through
a
special
without
a
button
in
the
middle
to
this
cable
were
firmly
linked
a
watch
at
one
end
and
a
at
the
other
the
chain
also
served
as
a
protection
against
a
thief
who
might
attempt
to
snatch
the
fancy
waistcoat
entire
then
there
were
longer
chains
beneath
the
waistcoat
partly
designed
no
doubt
to
deflect
bullets
but
serving
mainly
to
enable
the
owner
to
haul
up
penknives
and
from
the
profundities
of
an
essential
portion
of
the
man
braces
visible
sometimes
when
he
played
at
tennis
consisted
of
chain
and
the
upper
and
nether
halves
of
his
were
connected
by
chains
occasionally
he
was
to
be
seen
chained
to
a
dog
a
reversion
conceivably
to
a
mediaeval
type
yes
but
also
the
exemplar
of
the
excessively
modern
externally
he
was
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
years
previously
the
leading
tailor
in
bursley
had
permitted
his
son
to
be
apprenticed
in
london
the
father
died
the
son
had
the
wit
to
return
and
make
a
fortune
while
creating
a
new
type
in
the
town
a
type
of
which
multiple
chains
were
but
one
feature
and
that
the
least
expensive
if
the
most
salient
for
instance
up
to
the
historic
year
in
which
the
young
tailor
created
the
type
any
cap
was
a
cap
in
bursley
and
any
collar
was
a
collar
but
thenceforward
no
cap
was
a
cap
and
no
collar
was
a
collar
which
did
not
exactly
conform
in
shape
and
material
to
certain
sacred
caps
and
collars
guarded
by
the
young
tailor
in
his
back
shop
none
knew
why
these
sacred
caps
and
collars
were
sacred
but
they
were
their
sacredness
endured
for
about
six
months
and
then
suddenly
again
none
knew
why
they
fell
from
their
estate
and
became
lower
than
offal
for
dogs
and
were
supplanted
on
the
altar
the
type
brought
into
existence
by
the
young
tailor
was
to
be
recognized
by
its
caps
and
collars
and
in
a
similar
manner
by
every
other
article
of
attire
except
its
boots
unfortunately
the
tailor
did
not
sell
boots
and
so
imposed
on
his
creatures
no
mystical
creed
as
to
boots
this
was
a
pity
for
the
of
the
town
happened
not
to
be
inflamed
by
the
passion
as
the
tailor
was
and
thus
the
new
type
finished
abruptly
at
the
edges
of
the
tailor
trousers
the
man
at
no
luke
square
had
comparatively
small
and
narrow
feet
which
gave
him
an
advantage
and
as
he
was
endowed
with
a
certain
vague
general
physical
distinction
he
managed
despite
the
eternal
untidiness
of
his
hair
to
be
eminent
among
the
type
assuredly
the
frequent
sight
of
him
in
her
house
flattered
the
pride
of
eye
which
rested
on
him
almost
always
with
pleasure
he
had
come
into
the
house
with
startling
abruptness
soon
after
cyril
left
school
and
was
indentured
to
the
at
peel
that
classic
earthenware
manufactory
the
presence
of
a
man
in
her
abode
disconcerted
constance
at
the
beginning
but
she
soon
grew
accustomed
to
it
perceiving
that
a
man
would
behave
as
a
man
and
must
be
expected
to
do
so
this
man
in
truth
did
what
he
liked
in
all
things
cyril
having
always
been
regarded
by
both
his
parents
as
enormous
one
would
have
anticipated
a
giant
in
the
new
man
but
queerly
he
was
slim
and
little
above
the
average
height
neither
in
enormity
nor
in
many
other
particulars
did
he
resemble
the
cyril
whom
he
had
supplanted
his
gestures
were
lighter
and
quicker
he
had
nothing
of
cyril
ungainliness
he
had
not
cyril
limitless
taste
for
sweets
nor
cyril
terrific
hatred
of
gloves
barbers
and
soap
he
was
much
more
dreamy
than
cyril
and
much
busier
in
fact
constance
only
saw
him
at
he
was
at
peel
in
the
day
and
at
the
school
of
art
every
night
he
would
dream
during
a
meal
even
and
without
actually
saying
so
he
gave
the
impression
that
he
was
the
busiest
man
in
bursley
wrapped
in
occupations
and
preoccupations
as
in
a
blanket
a
blanket
which
constance
had
difficulty
in
penetrating
constance
wanted
to
please
him
she
lived
for
nothing
but
to
please
him
he
was
however
exceedingly
difficult
to
please
not
in
the
least
because
he
was
hypercritical
and
exacting
but
because
he
was
indifferent
constance
in
order
to
satisfy
her
desire
of
pleasing
had
to
make
fifty
efforts
in
the
hope
that
he
might
chance
to
notice
one
he
was
a
good
man
amazingly
industrious
when
once
constance
had
got
him
out
of
bed
in
the
morning
with
no
vices
kind
save
when
constance
mistakenly
tried
to
thwart
him
charming
with
a
curious
strain
of
humour
that
constance
only
half
understood
constance
was
unquestionably
vain
about
him
and
she
could
honestly
find
in
him
little
to
blame
but
whereas
he
was
the
whole
of
her
universe
she
was
merely
a
dim
figure
in
the
background
of
his
every
now
and
then
with
his
gentle
elegant
raillery
he
would
apparently
rediscover
her
as
though
saying
ah
you
still
there
are
you
constance
could
not
meet
him
on
the
plane
where
his
interests
lay
and
he
never
knew
the
passionate
intensity
of
her
absorption
in
that
minor
part
of
his
life
which
moved
on
her
plane
he
never
worried
about
her
solitude
or
guessed
that
in
throwing
her
a
smile
and
a
word
at
supper
he
was
paying
her
meagrely
for
three
hours
of
lone
rocking
in
a
the
worst
of
it
was
that
she
was
quite
incurable
no
experience
would
suffice
to
cure
her
trick
of
continually
expecting
him
to
notice
things
which
he
never
did
notice
one
day
he
said
in
the
midst
of
a
silence
by
the
way
did
father
leave
any
boxes
of
cigars
she
had
the
steps
up
into
her
bedroom
and
reached
down
from
the
dusty
top
of
the
wardrobe
the
box
which
she
had
put
there
after
samuel
funeral
in
handing
him
the
box
she
was
doing
a
great
deed
his
age
was
nineteen
and
she
was
ratifying
his
precocious
habit
of
smoking
by
this
solemn
gift
he
entirely
ignored
the
box
for
several
days
she
said
timidly
have
you
tried
those
cigars
not
yet
he
replied
i
try
one
of
these
days
ten
days
later
on
a
sunday
when
he
chanced
not
to
have
gone
out
with
his
aristocratic
friend
matthew
he
did
at
length
open
the
box
and
take
out
a
cigar
now
he
observed
roguishly
cutting
the
cigar
we
shall
see
mrs
plover
he
often
called
her
plover
for
fun
though
she
liked
him
to
be
sufficiently
interested
in
her
to
tease
her
she
did
not
like
being
called
plover
and
she
never
failed
to
say
i
not
mrs
plover
he
smoked
the
cigar
slowly
in
the
throwing
his
head
back
and
sending
clouds
to
the
ceiling
and
afterwards
he
remarked
the
old
man
cigars
were
so
bad
indeed
she
answered
tartly
as
if
maternally
resenting
this
easy
patronage
but
in
secret
she
was
delighted
there
was
something
in
her
son
favourable
verdict
on
her
husband
cigars
that
thrilled
her
and
she
looked
at
him
impossible
to
see
in
him
any
resemblance
to
his
father
oh
he
was
a
far
more
brilliant
more
advanced
more
complicated
more
seductive
being
than
his
homely
father
she
wondered
where
he
had
come
from
and
yet
if
his
father
had
lived
what
would
have
occurred
between
them
would
the
boy
have
been
openly
smoking
cigars
in
the
house
at
nineteen
she
laboriously
interested
herself
so
far
as
he
would
allow
in
his
artistic
studies
and
productions
a
back
attic
on
the
second
floor
was
now
transformed
into
a
studio
a
naked
apartment
which
smelt
of
oil
and
of
damp
clay
often
there
were
traces
of
clay
on
the
stairs
for
working
in
clay
he
demanded
of
his
mother
a
smock
and
she
made
a
smock
on
the
model
of
a
genuine
smock
which
she
obtained
from
a
who
sold
eggs
and
butter
in
the
covered
market
into
the
shoulders
of
the
smock
she
put
a
week
taking
the
pattern
from
an
old
book
of
embroidery
one
day
when
he
had
seen
her
stitching
morn
noon
and
afternoon
at
the
smock
he
said
as
she
rocked
idly
after
supper
i
suppose
you
have
forgotten
all
about
the
smock
i
asked
you
for
have
you
mater
she
knew
that
he
was
teasing
her
but
while
perfectly
realizing
how
foolish
she
was
she
nearly
always
acted
as
though
his
teasing
was
serious
she
picked
up
the
smock
again
from
the
sofa
when
the
smock
was
finished
he
examined
it
intently
then
exclaimed
with
an
air
of
surprise
by
jove
beautiful
where
did
you
get
this
pattern
he
continued
to
stare
at
it
smiling
in
pleasure
he
turned
over
the
tattered
leaves
of
the
with
the
same
naive
charmed
astonishment
and
carried
the
book
away
to
the
studio
i
must
show
that
to
swynnerton
he
said
as
for
her
the
epithet
seemed
a
strange
epithet
to
apply
to
a
mere
piece
of
honest
stitchery
done
in
a
pattern
and
a
stitch
with
which
she
had
been
familiar
all
her
life
the
fact
was
she
understood
his
less
and
less
the
sole
wall
decoration
of
his
studio
was
a
japanese
print
which
struck
her
as
being
entirely
preposterous
considered
as
a
picture
she
much
preferred
his
own
early
drawings
of
and
picturesque
castles
things
that
he
now
mercilessly
contemned
later
he
discovered
her
cutting
out
another
smock
what
that
for
he
inquired
well
she
said
you
manage
with
one
smock
what
shall
you
do
when
that
one
has
to
go
to
the
wash
wash
he
repeated
vaguely
there
no
need
for
it
to
go
to
the
cyril
she
replied
do
try
my
patience
i
was
thinking
of
making
you
he
whistled
with
all
that
stitching
he
questioned
amazed
at
the
undertaking
why
not
she
said
in
her
young
days
no
seamstress
ever
made
fewer
than
of
anything
and
it
was
usually
a
dozen
it
was
sometimes
dozen
well
he
murmured
you
have
got
a
nerve
i
say
that
similar
things
happened
whenever
he
showed
that
he
was
pleased
if
he
said
of
a
dish
in
the
local
tongue
i
could
do
a
bit
of
that
or
if
he
simply
smacked
his
lips
over
it
she
would
surfeit
him
with
that
dish
ii
on
a
hot
day
in
august
just
before
they
were
to
leave
bursley
for
a
month
in
the
isle
of
man
cyril
came
home
pale
and
perspiring
and
dropped
on
to
the
sofa
he
wore
a
grey
alpaca
suit
and
except
his
hair
which
in
addition
to
being
very
untidy
was
damp
with
sweat
he
was
a
masterpiece
of
slim
elegance
despite
the
heat
he
blew
out
great
sighs
and
rested
his
head
on
the
antimacassared
arm
of
the
sofa
well
mater
he
said
in
a
voice
of
factitious
calm
i
got
it
he
was
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
got
what
the
national
scholarship
swynnerton
says
it
a
sheer
fluke
but
got
it
great
glory
for
the
bursley
school
of
art
national
scholarship
she
said
what
that
what
is
it
now
mother
he
admonished
her
not
without
testiness
do
go
and
say
i
never
breathed
a
word
about
it
he
lit
a
cigarette
to
cover
his
for
he
perceived
that
she
was
moved
far
beyond
the
ordinary
never
in
fact
not
even
by
the
death
of
her
husband
had
she
received
such
a
frightful
blow
as
that
which
the
dreamy
cyril
had
just
dealt
her
it
was
not
a
complete
surprise
but
it
was
nearly
a
complete
surprise
a
few
months
previously
he
certainly
had
mentioned
in
his
incidental
way
the
subject
of
a
national
scholarship
apropos
of
a
which
he
had
designed
he
had
said
that
the
director
of
the
school
of
art
had
suggested
that
it
was
good
enough
to
compete
for
the
national
and
that
as
he
was
otherwise
qualified
for
the
competition
he
might
as
well
send
the
cup
to
south
kensington
he
had
added
that
had
laughed
at
the
notion
as
absurd
on
that
occasion
she
had
comprehended
that
a
national
scholarship
involved
residence
in
london
she
ought
to
have
begun
to
live
in
fear
for
cyril
had
a
most
disturbing
habit
of
making
a
mere
momentary
reference
to
matters
which
he
deemed
very
important
and
which
occupied
a
large
share
of
his
attention
he
was
secretive
by
nature
and
the
rigidity
of
his
rule
had
developed
this
trait
in
his
character
but
really
he
had
spoken
of
the
competition
with
such
an
extreme
casualness
that
with
little
effort
she
had
dismissed
it
from
her
anxieties
as
involving
a
contingency
so
remote
as
to
be
negligible
she
had
genuinely
almost
forgotten
it
only
at
rare
intervals
had
it
wakened
in
her
a
dull
transitory
pain
like
the
herald
of
a
fatal
malady
and
as
a
woman
in
the
opening
stage
of
disease
she
had
hastily
reassured
herself
how
silly
of
me
this
ca
possibly
be
anything
serious
and
now
she
was
condemned
she
knew
it
she
knew
there
could
be
no
appeal
she
knew
that
she
might
as
usefully
have
besought
mercy
from
a
tiger
as
from
her
good
industrious
dreamy
son
it
means
a
pound
a
week
said
cyril
his
intensified
by
her
silence
and
by
the
dreadful
look
on
her
face
and
of
course
free
tuition
for
how
long
she
managed
to
say
well
said
he
that
depends
nominally
for
a
year
but
if
you
behave
yourself
it
always
continued
for
three
years
if
he
stayed
for
three
years
he
would
never
come
back
that
was
a
certainty
how
she
rebelled
furious
and
despairing
against
the
fortuitous
cruelty
of
things
she
was
sure
that
he
had
not
till
then
thought
seriously
of
going
to
london
but
the
fact
that
the
government
would
admit
him
free
to
its
classrooms
and
give
him
a
pound
a
week
besides
somehow
forced
him
to
go
to
london
it
was
not
the
lack
of
means
that
would
have
prevented
him
from
going
why
then
should
the
presence
of
means
induce
him
to
go
there
was
no
logical
reason
the
whole
affair
was
disastrously
absurd
the
at
the
wedgwood
institution
had
chanced
merely
chanced
to
suggest
that
the
should
be
sent
to
south
kensington
and
the
result
of
this
caprice
was
that
she
was
sentenced
to
solitude
for
life
it
was
too
monstrously
too
incredibly
wicked
with
what
futile
and
bitter
execration
she
murmured
in
her
heart
the
word
if
cyril
childish
predilections
had
not
been
encouraged
if
he
had
only
been
content
to
follow
his
father
trade
if
she
had
flatly
refused
to
sign
his
indenture
at
peel
and
pay
the
premium
if
he
had
not
turned
from
colour
to
clay
if
the
had
not
had
that
fatal
if
the
judges
for
the
competition
had
decided
otherwise
if
only
she
had
brought
cyril
up
in
habits
of
obedience
sacrificing
temporary
peace
to
permanent
security
for
after
all
he
could
not
abandon
her
without
her
consent
he
was
not
of
age
and
he
would
want
a
lot
more
money
which
he
could
obtain
from
none
but
her
she
could
refuse
no
she
could
not
refuse
he
was
the
master
the
tyrant
for
the
sake
of
daily
pleasantness
she
had
weakly
yielded
to
him
at
the
start
she
had
behaved
badly
to
herself
and
to
him
he
was
spoiled
she
had
spoiled
him
and
he
was
about
to
repay
her
with
lifelong
misery
and
nothing
would
deflect
him
from
his
course
the
usual
conduct
of
the
spoilt
child
had
she
not
witnessed
it
and
moralized
upon
it
in
other
families
you
do
seem
very
chirpy
over
it
mater
he
said
she
went
out
of
the
room
his
joy
in
the
prospect
of
departure
from
the
five
towns
from
her
though
he
masked
it
was
more
manifest
than
she
could
bear
the
signal
the
next
day
made
a
special
item
of
the
news
it
appeared
that
no
national
scholarship
had
been
won
in
the
five
towns
for
eleven
years
the
citizens
were
exhorted
to
remember
that
povey
had
gained
his
success
in
open
competition
with
the
cleverest
young
students
of
the
entire
kingdom
and
in
a
branch
of
art
which
he
had
but
recently
taken
up
and
further
that
the
government
offered
only
eight
scholarships
each
year
the
name
of
cyril
povey
passed
from
lip
to
lip
and
nobody
who
met
constance
in
street
or
shop
could
refrain
from
informing
her
that
she
ought
to
be
a
proud
mother
to
have
such
a
son
but
that
truly
they
were
not
surprised
and
how
proud
his
poor
father
would
have
been
a
few
sympathetically
hinted
that
maternal
pride
was
one
of
those
luxuries
that
may
cost
too
dear
iii
the
holiday
in
the
isle
of
man
was
of
course
ruined
for
her
she
could
scarcely
walk
because
of
the
weight
of
a
lump
of
lead
that
she
carried
in
her
bosom
on
the
brightest
days
the
lump
of
lead
was
always
there
besides
she
was
so
obese
in
ordinary
circumstances
they
might
have
stayed
beyond
the
month
an
indentured
pupil
is
not
strapped
to
the
wheel
like
a
common
apprentice
moreover
the
indentures
were
to
be
cancelled
but
constance
did
not
care
to
stay
she
had
to
prepare
for
his
departure
to
london
she
had
to
lay
the
faggots
for
her
own
martyrdom
in
this
business
of
preparation
she
showed
as
much
silliness
she
betrayed
as
perfect
a
lack
of
perspective
as
the
most
superior
son
could
desire
for
a
topic
of
affectionate
irony
her
preoccupation
with
petty
things
of
no
importance
whatever
was
worthy
of
the
finest
traditions
of
fond
motherhood
however
cyril
careless
satire
had
no
effect
on
her
save
that
once
she
got
angry
thereby
startling
him
he
quite
correctly
and
sagely
laid
this
unprecedented
outburst
to
the
account
of
her
wrought
nerves
and
forgave
it
happily
for
the
smoothness
of
cyril
translation
to
london
young
was
acquainted
with
the
capital
had
a
brother
in
chelsea
knew
of
reputable
lodgings
was
indeed
an
encyclopaedia
of
the
town
and
would
himself
spend
a
portion
of
the
autumn
there
otherwise
the
preliminaries
which
his
mother
would
have
insisted
on
by
means
of
tears
and
hysteria
might
have
proved
fatiguing
to
cyril
the
day
came
when
on
that
day
week
cyril
would
be
gone
constance
steadily
fabricated
cheerfulness
against
the
prospect
she
said
suppose
i
come
with
you
he
smiled
in
toleration
of
this
joke
as
being
a
passable
quality
of
joke
and
then
she
smiled
in
the
same
sense
hastening
to
agree
with
him
that
as
a
joke
it
was
not
a
bad
joke
in
the
last
week
he
was
very
loyal
to
his
tailor
many
a
young
man
would
have
commanded
new
clothes
after
not
before
his
arrival
in
london
but
cyril
had
faith
in
his
creator
on
the
day
of
departure
the
household
the
very
house
itself
was
in
a
state
of
excitation
he
was
to
leave
early
he
would
not
listen
to
the
project
of
her
accompanying
him
as
far
as
knype
where
the
loop
line
joined
the
main
she
might
go
to
bursley
station
and
no
further
when
she
rebelled
he
disclosed
the
merest
hint
of
his
side
and
she
at
once
yielded
during
breakfast
she
did
not
cry
but
the
aspect
of
her
face
made
him
protest
now
look
here
mater
just
try
to
remember
that
i
shall
be
back
for
christmas
it
barely
three
months
and
he
lit
a
cigarette
she
made
no
reply
amy
lugged
a
gladstone
bag
down
the
crooked
stairs
a
trunk
was
already
close
to
the
door
it
had
wrinkled
the
carpet
and
deranged
the
mat
you
did
forget
to
put
the
in
did
you
amy
he
asked
n
no
cyril
she
blubbered
amy
constance
sharply
corrected
her
as
cyril
ran
upstairs
i
wonder
you
ca
control
yourself
better
than
that
amy
weakly
apologized
although
treated
almost
as
one
of
the
family
she
ought
not
to
have
forgotten
that
she
was
a
servant
what
right
had
she
to
weep
over
cyril
luggage
this
question
was
put
to
her
in
constance
tone
the
cab
came
cyril
tumbled
downstairs
with
exaggerated
carelessness
and
with
exaggerated
carelessness
he
joked
at
the
cabman
now
mother
he
cried
when
the
luggage
was
stowed
do
you
want
me
to
miss
this
train
but
he
knew
that
the
margin
of
time
was
ample
it
was
his
fun
nay
i
ca
be
hurried
she
said
fixing
her
bonnet
amy
as
soon
as
we
are
gone
you
can
clear
this
table
she
climbed
heavily
into
the
cab
that
it
smash
the
springs
cyril
teased
her
the
horse
got
a
stinging
cut
to
recall
him
to
the
seriousness
of
life
it
was
a
fine
bracing
autumn
morning
and
the
driver
felt
the
need
of
communicating
his
abundant
energy
to
some
one
or
something
they
drove
off
amy
staring
after
them
from
the
door
matters
had
been
so
marvellously
well
arranged
that
they
arrived
at
the
station
twenty
minutes
before
the
train
was
due
never
mind
cyril
mockingly
comforted
his
mother
you
rather
be
twenty
minutes
too
soon
than
one
minute
too
late
would
you
his
high
spirits
had
to
come
out
somehow
gradually
the
minutes
passed
and
the
empty
platform
became
dotted
with
people
to
whom
that
train
was
nothing
but
a
loop
line
train
people
who
took
that
train
every
of
their
lives
and
knew
all
its
eccentricities
and
they
heard
the
train
whistle
as
it
started
from
turnhill
and
cyril
had
a
final
word
with
the
porter
who
was
in
charge
of
the
luggage
he
made
a
handsome
figure
and
he
had
twenty
pounds
in
his
pocket
when
he
returned
to
constance
she
was
sniffing
and
through
her
veil
he
could
see
that
her
eyes
were
circled
with
red
but
through
her
veil
she
could
see
nothing
the
train
rolled
in
rattling
to
a
standstill
constance
lifted
her
veil
and
kissed
him
and
kissed
her
life
out
he
smelt
the
odour
of
her
crape
he
was
for
an
instant
close
to
her
close
and
he
seemed
to
have
an
overwhelmingly
intimate
glimpse
into
her
secrets
he
seemed
to
be
choked
in
the
sudden
strong
emotion
of
that
crape
he
felt
queer
here
you
are
sir
second
smoker
called
the
porter
the
daily
frequenters
of
the
train
boarded
it
with
their
customary
disgust
i
write
as
soon
as
ever
i
get
there
said
cyril
of
his
own
accord
it
was
the
best
he
could
muster
with
what
grace
he
raised
his
hat
a
clouds
of
steam
and
she
shared
the
dead
platform
with
two
porters
and
smith
noisy
boy
she
walked
home
very
slowly
and
painfully
the
lump
of
lead
was
heavier
than
ever
before
and
the
townspeople
saw
the
proudest
mother
in
bursley
walking
home
after
all
she
argued
with
her
soul
angrily
petulantly
could
you
expect
the
boy
to
do
anything
else
he
is
a
serious
student
he
has
had
a
brilliant
success
and
is
he
to
be
tied
to
your
the
idea
is
preposterous
it
is
as
if
he
was
an
idler
or
a
bad
son
no
mother
could
have
a
better
son
a
nice
thing
that
he
should
stay
all
his
life
in
bursley
simply
because
you
do
like
being
left
alone
unfortunately
one
might
as
well
argue
with
a
mule
as
with
one
soul
her
soul
only
kept
on
saying
monotonously
i
a
lonely
old
woman
now
i
nothing
to
live
for
any
more
and
i
no
use
to
anybody
once
i
was
young
and
proud
and
this
is
what
my
life
has
come
to
this
is
the
end
when
she
reached
home
amy
had
not
touched
the
breakfast
things
the
carpet
was
still
wrinkled
and
the
mat
still
out
of
place
and
through
the
desolating
atmosphere
of
reaction
after
a
terrific
crisis
she
marched
directly
upstairs
entered
his
plundered
room
and
beheld
the
disorder
of
the
bed
in
which
he
had
slept
book
iii
sophia
chapter
i
the
elopement
i
her
soberly
rich
dress
had
a
countrified
air
as
she
waited
ready
for
the
streets
in
the
bedroom
of
the
london
hotel
on
the
afternoon
of
the
first
of
july
but
there
was
nothing
of
the
provincial
in
that
beautiful
face
nor
in
that
bearing
at
once
shy
and
haughty
and
her
eager
heart
soared
beyond
geographical
boundaries
it
was
the
hatfield
hotel
in
salisbury
street
between
the
strand
and
the
river
both
street
and
hotel
are
now
gone
lost
in
the
vast
foundations
of
the
savoy
and
the
cecil
but
the
type
of
the
hatfield
lingers
with
shabbiness
in
jermyn
street
in
with
its
dark
passages
and
crooked
stairs
its
candles
its
carpets
and
stuffs
which
had
outlived
their
patterns
its
narrow
where
a
thousand
busy
flies
ate
together
at
one
long
table
its
acrid
stagnant
atmosphere
and
its
disturbing
sensation
of
dirt
everywhere
concealing
itself
it
stood
forth
in
rectitude
as
a
good
average
modern
hotel
the
patched
and
senile
drabness
of
the
bedroom
made
an
environment
that
emphasized
sophia
flashing
youth
she
alone
in
it
was
unsullied
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
apparently
gay
and
jaunty
but
she
thought
truly
he
nearly
as
nervous
as
i
am
and
in
her
sick
nervousness
she
coughed
and
then
tried
to
take
full
possession
of
herself
the
moment
had
at
last
come
which
would
divide
her
life
as
a
battle
divides
the
history
of
a
nation
her
mind
in
an
instant
swept
backwards
through
an
incredible
three
months
the
schemings
to
obtain
and
to
hide
gerald
letters
at
the
shop
and
to
reply
to
them
the
far
more
complex
and
dangerous
duplicity
practised
upon
her
majestic
aunt
at
axe
the
visits
to
the
axe
the
three
divine
meetings
with
gerald
at
early
morning
by
the
when
he
had
told
her
of
his
inheritance
and
of
the
harshness
of
his
uncle
boldero
and
with
a
rush
of
words
had
spread
before
her
the
prospect
of
eternal
bliss
the
nights
of
fear
the
sudden
dizzy
acquiescence
in
his
plan
and
the
feeling
of
universal
unreality
which
obsessed
her
the
audacious
departure
from
her
aunt
showering
a
cascade
of
appalling
lies
her
dismay
at
knype
station
her
blush
as
she
asked
for
a
ticket
to
london
the
ironic
sympathetic
glance
of
the
porter
who
took
charge
of
her
trunk
and
then
the
thunder
of
the
incoming
train
her
renewed
dismay
when
she
found
that
it
was
very
full
and
her
distracted
plunge
into
a
compartment
with
six
people
already
in
it
and
the
abrupt
reopening
of
the
and
that
curt
inquisition
from
an
inspector
where
for
please
where
for
where
for
until
her
turn
was
reached
where
for
miss
and
her
weak
little
reply
euston
and
more
violent
blushes
and
then
the
long
steady
beating
of
the
train
over
the
rails
keeping
time
to
the
rhythm
of
the
unanswerable
voice
within
her
breast
why
are
you
here
why
are
you
here
and
then
rugby
and
the
awful
ordeal
of
meeting
gerald
his
entry
into
the
compartment
the
rearrangement
of
seats
and
their
excruciatingly
painful
attempts
at
commonplace
conversation
in
the
publicity
of
the
carriage
she
had
felt
that
that
part
of
the
enterprise
had
not
been
very
well
devised
by
gerald
and
at
last
london
the
thousands
of
cabs
the
fabulous
streets
the
general
roar
all
intensifying
to
an
extraordinary
degree
the
obsession
of
unreality
the
illusion
that
she
could
not
really
have
done
what
she
had
done
that
she
was
not
really
doing
what
she
was
doing
supremely
and
finally
the
delicious
torture
of
the
clutch
of
terror
at
her
heart
as
she
moved
by
gerald
side
through
the
impossible
adventure
who
was
this
rash
mad
sophia
surely
not
herself
the
knock
at
the
door
was
impatiently
repeated
come
in
she
said
timidly
gerald
scales
came
in
yes
beneath
that
mien
of
a
commercial
traveller
who
has
been
everywhere
and
through
everything
he
was
very
nervous
it
was
her
privacy
that
with
her
consent
he
had
invaded
he
had
engaged
the
bedroom
only
with
the
intention
of
using
it
as
a
retreat
for
sophia
until
the
evening
when
they
were
to
resume
their
travels
it
ought
not
to
have
had
any
disturbing
significance
but
the
mere
disorder
on
the
washstand
a
towel
lying
on
one
of
the
cane
chairs
made
him
feel
that
he
was
affronting
decency
and
so
increased
his
jaunty
nervousness
the
moment
was
painful
the
moment
was
difficult
beyond
his
skill
to
handle
it
naturally
approaching
her
with
factitious
ease
he
kissed
her
through
her
veil
which
she
then
lifted
with
an
impulsive
movement
and
he
kissed
her
again
more
ardently
perceiving
that
her
ardour
was
exceeding
his
this
was
the
first
time
they
had
been
alone
together
since
her
flight
from
axe
and
yet
with
his
worldly
experience
he
was
naive
enough
to
be
surprised
that
he
could
not
put
all
the
heat
of
passion
into
his
embrace
and
he
wondered
why
he
was
not
thrilled
at
the
contact
with
her
however
the
powerful
clinging
of
her
lips
somewhat
startled
his
senses
and
also
delighted
him
by
its
silent
promise
he
could
smell
the
stuff
of
her
veil
the
sarsenet
of
her
bodice
and
as
it
were
wrapped
in
these
odours
as
her
body
was
wrapped
in
its
clothes
the
faint
fleshly
perfume
of
her
body
itself
her
face
viewed
so
close
that
he
could
see
the
almost
imperceptible
down
on
those
cheeks
was
astonishingly
beautiful
the
dark
eyes
were
exquisitely
misted
and
he
could
feel
the
secret
loyalty
of
her
soul
ascending
to
him
she
was
very
slightly
taller
than
her
lover
but
somehow
she
hung
from
him
her
body
curved
backwards
and
her
bosom
pressed
against
his
so
that
instead
of
looking
up
at
her
gaze
he
looked
down
at
it
he
preferred
that
perfectly
proportioned
though
he
was
his
stature
was
a
delicate
point
with
him
his
spirits
rose
by
the
uplift
of
his
senses
his
fears
slipped
away
he
began
to
be
very
satisfied
with
himself
he
was
the
inheritor
of
twelve
thousand
pounds
and
he
had
won
this
unique
creature
she
was
his
capture
he
held
her
close
permittedly
scanning
the
minutiae
of
her
skin
permittedly
crushing
her
flimsy
silks
something
in
him
had
forced
her
to
lay
her
modesty
on
the
altar
of
his
desire
and
the
sun
brightly
shone
so
he
kissed
her
yet
more
ardently
and
with
the
slightest
touch
of
a
victor
condescension
and
her
burning
response
more
than
restored
the
which
he
had
been
losing
i
got
no
one
but
you
now
she
murmured
in
a
melting
voice
she
fancied
in
her
ignorance
that
the
expression
of
this
sentiment
would
please
him
she
was
not
aware
that
a
man
is
usually
rather
chilled
by
it
because
it
proves
to
him
that
the
other
is
thinking
about
his
responsibilities
and
not
about
his
privileges
certainly
it
calmed
gerald
though
without
imparting
to
him
her
sense
of
his
responsibilities
he
smiled
vaguely
to
sophia
his
smile
was
a
miracle
continually
renewed
it
mingled
dashing
gaiety
with
a
hint
of
wistful
appeal
in
a
manner
that
never
failed
to
bewitch
her
a
less
innocent
girl
than
sophia
might
have
divined
from
that
adorable
smile
that
she
could
do
anything
with
gerald
except
rely
on
him
but
sophia
had
to
learn
are
you
ready
he
asked
placing
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
holding
her
away
from
him
yes
she
said
nerving
herself
their
faces
were
still
very
near
together
well
would
you
like
to
go
and
see
the
dore
pictures
a
simple
enough
question
a
proposal
felicitous
enough
dore
was
becoming
known
even
in
the
five
towns
not
assuredly
by
his
illustrations
to
the
contes
drolatiques
of
balzac
but
by
his
shuddering
biblical
conceits
in
pious
circles
dore
was
saving
art
from
the
reproach
of
futility
and
frivolity
it
was
indubitably
a
tasteful
idea
on
gerald
part
to
take
his
love
of
a
summer
afternoon
to
gaze
at
the
originals
of
those
prints
which
had
so
deeply
impressed
the
five
towns
it
was
an
idea
that
sanctified
the
profane
adventure
yet
sophia
showed
signs
of
affliction
her
colour
went
and
came
her
throat
made
the
motion
of
swallowing
there
was
a
muscular
contraction
over
her
whole
body
and
she
drew
herself
from
him
her
glance
however
did
not
leave
him
and
his
eyes
fell
before
hers
but
what
about
the
wedding
she
breathed
that
sentence
seemed
to
cost
all
her
pride
but
she
was
obliged
to
utter
it
and
to
pay
for
it
oh
he
said
lightly
and
quickly
just
as
though
she
had
reminded
him
of
a
detail
that
might
have
been
forgotten
i
was
just
going
to
tell
you
it
ca
be
done
here
there
been
some
change
in
the
rules
i
only
found
out
for
certain
late
last
night
but
i
ascertained
that
it
be
as
simple
as
abc
before
the
english
consul
at
paris
and
as
i
got
the
tickets
for
us
to
go
over
as
we
arranged
he
stopped
she
sat
down
on
the
chair
staggered
she
believed
what
he
said
she
did
not
suspect
that
he
was
using
the
classic
device
of
the
seducer
it
was
his
casualness
that
staggered
her
had
it
really
been
his
intention
to
set
off
on
an
excursion
and
remark
as
an
afterthought
by
the
way
we
ca
be
married
as
i
told
you
at
two
despite
her
extreme
ignorance
and
innocence
sophia
held
a
high
opinion
of
her
own
commonsense
and
capacity
for
looking
after
herself
and
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
he
was
expecting
her
to
go
to
paris
and
at
night
without
being
married
she
looked
pitiably
young
virgin
raw
unsophisticated
helpless
in
the
midst
of
dreadful
dangers
yet
her
head
was
full
of
a
blank
astonishment
at
being
mistaken
for
a
simpleton
the
sole
explanation
could
be
that
gerald
in
some
matters
must
himself
be
a
confiding
simpleton
he
had
not
reflected
he
had
not
sufficiently
realized
the
immensity
of
her
sacrifice
in
flying
with
him
even
to
london
she
felt
sorry
for
him
she
had
the
woman
first
glimpse
of
the
necessity
for
some
adjustment
of
outlook
as
an
essential
preliminary
to
uninterrupted
happiness
it
be
all
right
gerald
persuasively
continued
he
looked
at
her
as
she
was
not
looking
at
him
she
was
nineteen
but
she
seemed
to
him
utterly
mature
and
mysterious
her
face
baffled
him
her
mind
was
a
foreign
land
helpless
in
one
sense
she
might
be
yet
she
and
not
he
stood
for
destiny
the
future
lay
in
the
secret
and
capricious
workings
of
that
mind
oh
no
she
exclaimed
curtly
oh
no
oh
no
what
we
ca
possibly
go
like
that
she
said
but
do
i
tell
you
it
be
all
right
he
protested
if
we
stay
here
and
they
come
after
you
besides
i
got
the
tickets
and
all
why
did
you
tell
me
sooner
she
demanded
but
how
could
i
he
grumbled
have
we
had
a
single
minute
alone
this
was
nearly
true
they
could
not
have
discussed
the
formalities
of
marriage
in
the
crowded
train
nor
during
the
hurried
lunch
with
a
dozen
cocked
ears
at
the
same
table
he
saw
himself
on
sure
ground
here
now
could
we
he
pressed
and
you
talk
about
going
to
see
pictures
was
her
reply
undoubtedly
this
had
been
a
grave
error
of
tact
he
recognized
that
it
was
a
stupidity
and
so
he
resented
it
as
though
she
had
committed
it
and
not
he
my
dear
girl
he
said
hurt
i
acted
for
the
best
it
is
my
fault
if
rules
are
altered
and
officials
silly
you
ought
to
have
told
me
before
she
persisted
sullenly
but
how
could
i
he
almost
believed
in
that
moment
that
he
had
really
intended
to
marry
her
and
that
the
ineptitudes
of
had
prevented
him
from
achieving
his
honourable
purpose
whereas
he
had
done
nothing
whatever
towards
the
marriage
oh
no
oh
no
she
repeated
with
heavy
lip
and
liquid
eye
oh
no
he
gathered
that
she
was
flouting
his
suggestion
of
paris
slowly
and
nervously
he
approached
her
she
did
not
stir
nor
look
up
her
glance
was
fixed
on
the
washstand
he
bent
down
and
murmured
come
now
it
be
all
right
you
travel
in
the
ladies
saloon
on
the
she
did
not
stir
he
bent
lower
and
touched
the
back
of
her
neck
with
his
lips
and
she
sprang
up
sobbing
and
angry
because
she
was
mad
for
him
she
hated
him
furiously
all
tenderness
had
vanished
i
thank
you
not
to
touch
me
she
said
fiercely
she
had
given
him
her
lips
a
moment
ago
but
now
to
graze
her
neck
was
an
insult
he
smiled
sheepishly
but
really
you
must
be
reasonable
he
argued
what
have
i
done
it
what
you
have
done
i
think
she
cried
why
did
you
tell
me
while
we
were
in
the
cab
i
did
care
to
begin
worrying
you
just
then
he
replied
which
was
exactly
true
the
fact
was
he
had
of
course
shirked
telling
her
that
no
marriage
would
occur
that
day
not
being
a
professional
seducer
of
young
girls
he
lacked
skill
to
do
a
difficult
thing
simply
now
come
along
little
girl
he
went
on
with
just
a
trifle
of
impatience
let
go
out
and
enjoy
ourselves
i
assure
you
that
everything
will
be
all
right
in
paris
that
what
you
said
about
coming
to
london
she
retorted
sarcastically
through
her
sobs
and
look
at
you
did
he
imagine
for
a
single
instant
that
she
would
have
come
to
london
with
him
save
on
the
understanding
that
she
was
to
be
married
immediately
upon
arrival
this
attitude
of
an
indignant
question
was
not
to
be
reconciled
with
her
belief
that
his
excuses
for
himself
were
truthful
but
she
did
not
remark
the
discrepancy
her
sarcasm
wounded
his
vanity
oh
very
well
he
muttered
if
you
do
choose
to
believe
what
i
say
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
she
said
nothing
but
the
sobs
swept
at
intervals
through
her
frame
shaking
it
reading
hesitation
in
her
face
he
tried
again
come
along
little
girl
and
wipe
your
eyes
and
he
approached
her
she
stepped
back
no
no
she
denied
him
passionately
he
had
esteemed
her
too
cheaply
and
she
did
not
care
to
be
called
girl
then
what
shall
you
do
he
inquired
in
a
tone
which
blended
mockery
and
bullying
she
was
making
a
fool
of
him
i
can
tell
you
what
i
sha
do
she
said
i
sha
go
to
paris
her
sobs
were
less
frequent
that
not
my
question
he
said
icily
i
want
to
know
what
you
will
do
there
was
now
no
pretence
of
affectionateness
either
on
her
part
or
on
his
they
might
to
judge
from
their
attitudes
have
been
nourished
from
infancy
on
mutual
hatred
what
that
got
to
do
with
you
she
demanded
it
got
everything
to
do
with
me
he
said
well
you
can
go
and
find
out
she
said
it
was
girlish
it
was
childish
it
was
scarcely
according
to
the
canons
for
conducting
a
final
rupture
but
it
was
not
the
less
tragically
serious
indeed
the
spectacle
of
this
young
girl
absurdly
behaving
like
one
in
a
serious
crisis
increased
the
tragicalness
of
the
situation
even
if
it
did
not
heighten
it
the
idea
that
ran
through
gerald
brain
was
the
ridiculous
folly
of
having
anything
to
do
with
young
girls
he
was
quite
blind
to
her
beauty
he
repeated
her
word
you
mean
that
of
course
i
mean
it
she
answered
promptly
the
coward
in
him
urged
him
to
take
advantage
of
her
ignorant
helpless
pride
and
leave
her
at
her
word
he
remembered
the
scene
she
had
made
at
the
pit
shaft
and
he
said
to
himself
that
her
charm
was
not
worth
her
temper
and
that
he
was
a
fool
ever
to
have
dreamed
that
it
was
and
that
he
would
be
doubly
a
fool
now
not
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
withdrawing
from
an
insane
enterprise
i
am
to
go
he
asked
with
a
sneer
she
nodded
of
course
if
you
order
me
to
leave
you
i
must
can
i
do
anything
for
you
she
signified
that
he
could
not
nothing
you
sure
she
frowned
well
then
he
turned
towards
the
door
i
suppose
you
leave
me
here
without
money
or
anything
she
said
in
a
cold
cutting
voice
and
her
sneer
was
far
more
destructive
than
his
it
destroyed
in
him
the
last
trace
of
compassion
for
her
oh
i
beg
pardon
he
said
and
swaggeringly
counted
out
five
sovereigns
on
to
a
chest
of
drawers
she
rushed
at
them
do
you
think
i
take
your
odious
money
she
snarled
gathering
the
coins
in
her
gloved
hand
her
first
impulse
was
to
throw
them
in
his
face
but
she
paused
and
then
flung
them
into
a
corner
of
the
room
pick
them
up
she
commanded
him
no
thanks
he
said
briefly
and
left
shutting
the
door
only
a
very
little
while
and
they
had
been
lovers
exuding
tenderness
with
every
gesture
like
a
perfume
only
a
very
little
while
and
she
had
been
deciding
to
telegraph
condescendingly
to
her
mother
that
she
was
right
and
now
the
dream
was
utterly
dissolved
and
the
voice
of
that
hard
commonsense
which
spake
to
her
in
her
wildest
moods
grew
loud
in
asserting
that
the
enterprise
could
never
have
come
to
any
good
that
it
was
from
its
inception
an
impossible
enterprise
unredeemed
by
the
slightest
justification
an
enormous
folly
yes
an
elopement
but
not
like
a
real
elopement
always
unreal
she
had
always
known
that
it
was
only
an
imitation
of
an
elopement
and
must
end
in
some
awful
disappointment
she
had
never
truly
wanted
to
run
away
but
something
within
her
had
pricked
her
forward
in
spite
of
her
protests
the
strict
notions
of
her
elderly
relatives
were
right
after
all
it
was
she
who
had
been
wrong
and
it
was
she
who
would
have
to
pay
i
been
a
wicked
girl
she
said
to
herself
grimly
in
the
midst
of
her
ruin
she
faced
the
fact
but
she
would
not
repent
at
any
rate
she
would
never
sit
on
that
stool
she
would
not
exchange
the
remains
of
her
pride
for
the
means
of
escape
from
the
worst
misery
that
life
could
offer
on
that
point
she
knew
herself
and
she
set
to
work
to
repair
and
renew
her
pride
whatever
happened
she
would
not
return
to
the
five
towns
she
could
not
because
she
had
stolen
money
from
her
aunt
harriet
as
much
as
she
had
thrown
back
at
gerald
she
had
filched
from
her
aunt
but
in
the
form
of
a
note
a
prudent
mysterious
instinct
had
moved
her
to
take
this
precaution
and
she
was
glad
she
would
never
have
been
able
to
dart
that
sneer
at
gerald
about
money
if
she
had
really
needed
money
so
she
rejoiced
in
her
crime
though
since
aunt
harriet
would
assuredly
discover
the
loss
at
once
the
crime
eternally
prevented
her
from
going
back
to
her
family
never
never
would
she
look
at
her
mother
with
the
eyes
of
a
thief
in
truth
aunt
harriet
did
discover
the
loss
and
very
creditably
said
naught
about
it
to
anybody
the
knowledge
of
it
would
have
twisted
the
knife
in
the
maternal
heart
sophia
was
also
glad
that
she
had
refused
to
proceed
to
paris
the
recollection
of
her
firmness
in
refusing
flattered
her
vanity
as
a
girl
convinced
that
she
could
take
care
of
herself
to
go
to
paris
unmarried
would
have
been
an
inconceivable
madness
the
mere
thought
of
the
enormity
did
outrage
to
her
moral
susceptibilities
no
gerald
had
most
perfectly
mistaken
her
for
another
sort
of
girl
as
for
instance
a
or
a
barmaid
with
this
the
catalogue
of
her
satisfactions
ended
she
had
no
idea
at
all
as
to
what
she
ought
to
do
or
could
do
the
mere
prospect
of
venturing
out
of
the
room
intimidated
her
had
gerald
left
her
trunk
in
the
hall
of
course
he
had
what
a
question
but
what
would
happen
to
her
london
london
had
merely
dazed
her
she
could
do
nothing
for
herself
she
was
as
helpless
as
a
rabbit
in
london
she
drew
aside
the
and
had
a
glimpse
of
the
river
it
was
inevitable
that
she
should
think
of
suicide
for
she
could
not
suppose
that
any
girl
had
ever
got
herself
into
a
plight
more
desperate
than
hers
i
could
slip
out
at
night
and
drown
myself
she
thought
seriously
a
nice
thing
that
would
be
for
gerald
then
loneliness
like
a
black
midnight
overwhelmed
her
swiftly
wasting
her
strength
disintegrating
her
pride
in
its
horrid
flood
she
glanced
about
for
support
as
a
woman
in
the
open
street
who
feels
she
is
going
to
faint
and
went
blindly
to
the
bed
falling
on
it
with
the
upper
part
of
her
body
in
an
attitude
of
abandonment
she
wept
but
without
sobbing
ii
gerald
scales
walked
about
the
strand
staring
up
at
its
high
narrow
houses
crushed
one
against
another
as
though
they
had
been
packed
unsorted
by
a
packer
who
thought
of
nothing
but
economy
of
space
except
by
somerset
house
king
college
and
one
or
two
theatres
and
banks
the
monotony
of
mean
shops
with
several
storeys
unevenly
perched
over
them
was
unbroken
then
gerald
encountered
exeter
hall
and
examined
its
prominent
facade
with
a
provincial
eye
for
despite
his
travels
he
was
not
very
familiar
with
london
exeter
hall
naturally
took
his
mind
back
to
his
uncle
boldero
that
great
and
ardent
nonconformist
and
his
own
godly
youth
it
was
laughable
to
muse
upon
what
his
uncle
would
say
and
think
did
the
old
man
know
that
his
nephew
had
run
away
with
a
girl
meaning
to
seduce
her
in
paris
it
was
enormously
funny
however
he
had
done
with
all
that
he
was
well
out
of
it
she
had
told
him
to
go
and
he
had
gone
she
had
money
to
get
home
she
had
nothing
to
do
but
use
the
tongue
in
her
head
the
rest
was
her
affair
he
would
go
to
paris
alone
and
find
another
amusement
it
was
absurd
to
have
supposed
that
sophia
would
ever
have
suited
him
not
in
such
a
family
as
the
baineses
could
one
reasonably
expect
to
discover
an
ideal
mistress
no
there
had
been
a
mistake
the
whole
business
was
wrong
she
had
nearly
made
a
fool
of
him
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
be
made
a
fool
of
he
had
kept
his
dignity
intact
so
he
said
to
himself
yet
all
the
time
his
dignity
and
his
pride
also
were
bleeding
dropping
invisible
blood
along
the
length
of
the
strand
pavements
he
was
at
salisbury
street
again
he
pictured
her
in
the
bedroom
damn
her
he
wanted
her
he
wanted
her
with
an
excessive
desire
he
hated
to
think
that
he
had
been
baulked
he
hated
to
think
that
she
would
remain
immaculate
and
he
continued
to
picture
her
in
the
exciting
privacy
of
that
cursed
bedroom
now
he
was
walking
down
salisbury
street
he
did
not
wish
to
be
walking
down
salisbury
street
but
there
he
was
oh
hell
he
murmured
i
suppose
i
must
go
through
with
it
he
felt
desperate
he
was
ready
to
pay
any
price
in
order
to
be
able
to
say
to
himself
that
he
had
accomplished
what
he
had
set
his
heart
on
my
wife
has
gone
out
has
she
he
asked
of
the
i
not
sure
sir
i
think
not
said
the
the
fear
that
sophia
had
already
departed
made
him
sick
when
he
noticed
her
trunk
still
there
he
took
hope
and
ran
upstairs
he
saw
her
a
dark
crumpled
sinuous
piece
of
humanity
half
on
and
half
off
the
bed
silhouetted
against
the
counterpane
her
hat
was
on
the
floor
with
the
spotted
veil
trailing
away
from
it
this
sight
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
most
touching
that
he
had
ever
seen
though
her
face
was
hidden
he
forgot
everything
except
the
deep
and
strange
emotion
which
affected
him
he
approached
the
bed
she
did
not
stir
having
heard
the
entry
and
knowing
that
it
must
be
gerald
who
had
entered
sophia
forced
herself
to
remain
still
a
wild
splendid
hope
shot
up
in
her
constrained
by
all
the
power
of
her
will
not
to
move
she
could
not
stifle
a
sob
that
had
lain
in
ambush
in
her
throat
the
sound
of
the
sob
fetched
tears
to
the
eyes
of
gerald
sophia
he
appealed
to
her
but
she
did
not
stir
another
sob
shook
her
very
well
then
said
gerald
we
stay
in
london
till
we
can
be
married
i
arrange
it
i
find
a
nice
for
you
and
i
tell
the
people
you
my
cousin
i
shall
stay
on
at
this
hotel
and
i
come
and
see
you
every
day
a
silence
thank
you
she
blubbered
thank
you
he
saw
that
her
little
gloved
hand
was
stretching
out
towards
him
like
a
feeler
and
he
seized
it
and
knelt
down
and
took
her
clumsily
by
the
waist
somehow
he
dared
not
kiss
her
yet
an
immense
relief
surged
very
slowly
through
them
both
i
i
really
she
began
to
say
something
but
the
articulation
was
lost
in
her
sobs
what
what
do
you
say
dearest
he
questioned
eagerly
and
she
made
another
effort
i
really
could
have
gone
to
paris
with
you
without
being
married
she
succeeded
at
last
i
really
could
no
no
he
soothed
her
of
course
you
could
it
was
i
who
was
wrong
but
you
did
know
how
i
felt
sophia
it
all
right
now
is
it
she
sat
up
and
kissed
him
fairly
it
was
so
wonderful
and
startling
that
he
burst
openly
into
tears
she
saw
in
the
facile
intensity
of
his
emotion
a
guarantee
of
their
future
happiness
and
as
he
had
soothed
her
so
now
she
soothed
him
they
clung
together
equally
surprised
at
the
sweet
exquisite
blissful
melancholy
which
drenched
them
through
and
through
it
was
remorse
for
having
quarrelled
for
having
lacked
faith
in
the
supreme
rightness
of
the
high
adventure
everything
was
right
and
would
be
right
and
they
had
been
criminally
absurd
it
was
remorse
but
it
was
pure
bliss
and
worth
the
quarrel
gerald
resumed
his
perfection
again
in
her
eyes
he
was
the
soul
of
goodness
and
honour
and
for
him
she
was
again
the
ideal
mistress
who
would
however
be
also
a
wife
as
in
his
mind
he
rapidly
ran
over
the
steps
necessary
to
their
marriage
he
kept
saying
to
himself
far
off
in
some
remote
cavern
of
the
brain
i
shall
have
her
i
shall
have
her
he
did
not
reflect
that
this
fragile
slip
of
the
baines
stock
unconsciously
drawing
upon
the
accumulated
strength
of
generations
of
honest
living
had
put
a
defeat
upon
him
after
tea
gerald
utterly
content
with
the
universe
redeemed
his
word
and
found
an
irreproachable
for
sophia
in
westminster
near
the
abbey
she
was
astonished
at
the
glibness
of
his
lies
to
the
landlady
about
her
and
about
their
circumstances
generally
he
also
found
a
church
and
a
parson
close
by
and
in
half
an
hour
the
formalities
preliminary
to
a
marriage
were
begun
he
explained
to
her
that
as
she
was
now
resident
in
london
it
would
be
simpler
to
recommence
the
business
entirely
she
sagaciously
agreed
as
she
by
no
means
wished
to
wound
him
again
she
made
no
inquiry
about
those
other
formalities
which
owing
to
had
so
unexpectedly
proved
abortive
she
knew
she
was
going
to
be
married
and
that
sufficed
the
next
day
she
carried
out
her
filial
idea
of
telegraphing
to
her
mother
chapter
ii
supper
i
they
had
been
to
versailles
and
had
dined
there
a
tram
had
sufficed
to
take
them
out
but
for
the
return
gerald
who
had
been
drinking
champagne
would
not
be
content
with
less
than
a
carriage
further
he
insisted
on
entering
paris
by
way
of
the
bois
and
the
arc
de
triomphe
thoroughly
to
appease
his
conceit
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
swing
open
the
gates
of
honour
in
the
arc
and
allow
his
fiacre
to
pass
through
to
be
forced
to
drive
round
the
monument
instead
of
under
it
hurt
the
sense
of
fitness
which
champagne
engenders
gerald
was
in
all
his
pride
that
day
he
had
been
displaying
the
wonders
to
sophia
and
he
could
not
escape
the
cicerone
secret
feeling
that
he
himself
was
somehow
responsible
for
the
wonders
moreover
he
was
exceedingly
satisfied
with
the
effect
produced
by
sophia
sophia
on
arriving
in
paris
with
the
ring
on
her
triumphant
finger
had
timidly
mentioned
the
subject
of
frocks
none
would
have
guessed
from
her
tone
that
she
was
possessed
by
the
desire
for
french
clothes
as
by
a
devil
she
had
been
surprised
and
delighted
by
the
eagerness
of
gerald
response
gerald
too
was
possessed
by
a
devil
he
thirsted
to
see
her
in
french
clothes
he
knew
some
of
the
shops
and
ateliers
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
the
rue
de
la
chaussee
and
the
palais
royal
he
was
much
more
skilled
in
the
lore
of
frocks
than
she
for
his
previous
business
in
paris
had
brought
him
into
relations
with
the
great
firms
and
sophia
suffered
a
brief
humiliation
in
the
discovery
that
his
private
opinion
of
her
dresses
was
that
they
were
not
dresses
at
all
she
had
been
aware
that
they
were
not
parisian
nor
even
of
london
but
she
had
thought
them
pretty
good
it
healed
her
wound
however
to
reflect
that
gerald
had
so
marvellously
kept
his
own
counsel
in
order
to
spare
her
gerald
had
taken
her
to
an
establishment
in
the
chaussee
it
was
not
one
of
what
gerald
called
les
grandes
maisons
but
it
was
on
the
very
fringe
of
them
and
the
real
haute
couture
was
practised
therein
and
gerald
was
remembered
there
by
name
sophia
had
gone
in
trembling
and
ashamed
yet
in
her
heart
courageously
determined
to
emerge
uncompromisingly
french
but
the
models
frightened
her
they
surpassed
even
the
most
fantastic
things
that
she
had
seen
in
the
streets
she
recoiled
before
them
and
seemed
to
hide
for
refuge
in
gerald
as
it
were
appealing
to
him
for
moral
protection
and
answering
to
him
instead
of
to
the
saleswoman
when
the
saleswoman
offered
remarks
in
stiff
english
the
prices
also
frightened
her
the
simplest
trifle
here
cost
sixteen
pounds
and
her
mother
historic
whose
elaborateness
had
cost
twelve
pounds
was
supposed
to
have
approached
the
inexpressible
gerald
said
that
she
was
not
to
think
about
prices
she
was
however
forced
by
some
instinct
to
think
about
prices
she
who
at
home
had
scorned
the
narrowness
of
life
in
the
square
in
the
square
she
was
understood
to
be
quite
without
commonsense
hopelessly
imprudent
yet
here
a
spring
of
sagacity
seemed
to
be
welling
up
in
her
all
the
time
a
continual
antidote
against
the
general
madness
in
which
she
found
herself
with
extraordinary
rapidity
she
had
formed
a
habit
of
preaching
moderation
to
gerald
she
hated
to
money
thrown
away
and
her
notion
of
the
boundary
line
between
throwing
money
away
and
judiciously
spending
it
was
still
the
notion
of
the
square
gerald
would
laugh
but
she
would
say
piqued
and
blushing
but
you
can
laugh
it
was
all
deliciously
agreeable
on
this
evening
she
wore
the
first
of
the
new
costumes
she
had
worn
it
all
day
characteristically
she
had
chosen
something
which
was
not
too
special
for
either
afternoon
or
evening
for
either
warm
or
cold
weather
it
was
of
pale
blue
taffetas
striped
in
a
darker
blue
with
the
corsage
cut
in
basques
and
the
underskirt
of
a
similar
taffetas
but
unstriped
the
effect
of
the
ornate
overskirt
falling
on
the
plain
underskirt
with
its
small
double
volant
was
she
thought
and
gerald
too
adorable
the
waist
was
higher
than
any
she
had
had
before
and
the
crinoline
expansive
tied
round
her
head
with
a
large
bow
and
flying
blue
ribbons
under
the
chin
was
a
fragile
flat
capote
like
a
baby
bonnet
which
allowed
her
hair
to
escape
in
front
and
her
great
chignon
behind
a
large
spotted
veil
flew
out
from
the
capote
over
the
chignon
her
double
skirts
waved
amply
over
gerald
knees
in
the
carriage
and
she
leaned
back
against
the
hard
cushions
and
put
an
arrogant
look
into
her
face
and
thought
of
nothing
but
the
intense
throbbing
joy
of
life
longing
with
painful
ardour
for
more
and
more
pleasure
then
and
for
ever
as
the
carriage
slipped
downwards
through
the
wide
empty
gloom
of
the
champs
elysees
into
the
brilliant
paris
that
was
waiting
for
them
another
carriage
drawn
by
two
white
horses
flashed
upwards
and
was
gone
in
dust
its
only
occupant
except
the
coachman
and
footman
was
a
woman
gerald
stared
after
it
by
jove
he
exclaimed
that
hortense
it
might
have
been
hortense
or
it
might
not
but
he
instantly
convinced
himself
that
it
was
not
every
evening
did
one
meet
hortense
driving
alone
in
the
champs
elysees
and
in
august
too
hortense
sophia
asked
simply
yes
hortense
schneider
who
is
she
you
never
heard
of
hortense
schneider
no
well
have
you
ever
heard
of
offenbach
i
i
do
know
i
do
think
so
he
had
the
mien
of
utter
incredulity
you
do
mean
to
say
never
heard
of
bluebeard
i
heard
of
bluebeard
of
course
said
she
who
has
i
mean
the
opera
offenbach
she
shook
her
head
scarce
knowing
even
what
an
opera
was
well
well
what
next
he
implied
that
such
ignorance
stood
alone
in
his
experience
really
he
was
delighted
at
the
cleanness
of
the
slate
on
which
he
had
to
write
and
sophia
was
not
a
bit
alarmed
she
relished
instruction
from
his
lips
it
was
a
pleasure
to
her
to
learn
from
that
exhaustless
store
of
worldly
knowledge
to
the
world
she
would
do
her
best
to
assume
omniscience
in
its
ways
but
to
him
in
her
present
mood
she
liked
to
play
the
ignorant
uninitiated
little
thing
why
he
said
the
schneider
has
been
the
rage
since
last
year
but
one
absolutely
the
rage
i
do
wish
i
noticed
her
said
sophia
as
soon
as
the
varietes
reopens
we
go
and
see
her
he
replied
and
then
gave
his
detailed
version
of
the
career
of
hortense
schneider
more
joys
for
her
in
the
near
future
she
had
yet
scarcely
penetrated
the
crust
of
her
bliss
she
exulted
in
the
dazzling
destiny
which
comprised
freedom
fortune
eternal
gaiety
and
the
exquisite
gerald
as
they
crossed
the
place
de
la
concorde
she
inquired
are
we
going
back
to
the
hotel
no
he
said
i
thought
we
go
and
have
supper
somewhere
if
it
is
too
early
after
all
that
dinner
all
what
dinner
you
ate
about
five
times
as
much
as
me
anyhow
oh
i
ready
she
said
she
was
this
day
because
it
was
the
first
day
of
her
french
frock
she
regarded
as
her
debut
in
the
dizzy
life
of
capitals
she
existed
in
a
rapture
of
bliss
an
ecstasy
which
could
feel
no
fatigue
either
of
body
or
spirit
ii
it
was
after
midnight
when
they
went
into
the
restaurant
sylvain
gerald
having
decided
not
to
go
to
the
hotel
had
changed
his
mind
and
called
there
and
having
called
there
had
remained
a
long
time
this
of
course
sophia
was
already
accustoming
herself
to
the
idea
that
with
gerald
it
was
impossible
to
predict
accurately
more
than
five
minutes
of
the
future
as
the
chasseur
held
open
the
door
for
them
to
enter
and
sophia
passed
modestly
into
the
glowing
yellow
interior
of
the
restaurant
followed
by
gerald
in
his
character
of
they
drew
the
attention
of
sylvain
numerous
and
glittering
guests
no
face
could
have
made
a
more
provocative
contrast
to
the
women
faces
in
those
screened
rooms
than
the
face
of
sophia
so
childlike
between
the
baby
bonnet
and
the
huge
bow
of
ribbon
so
candid
so
charmingly
conscious
of
its
own
pure
beauty
and
of
the
fact
that
she
was
no
longer
a
virgin
but
the
equal
in
knowledge
of
any
woman
alive
she
saw
around
her
clustered
about
the
white
tables
multitudes
of
violently
red
lips
powdered
cheeks
cold
hard
eyes
arrogant
faces
and
insolent
bosoms
what
had
impressed
her
more
than
anything
else
in
paris
more
even
than
the
omnibuses
was
the
extraordinary
of
all
the
women
their
unashamed
posing
their
calm
acceptance
of
the
public
gaze
they
seemed
to
say
we
are
the
renowned
parisiennes
they
frightened
her
they
appeared
to
her
so
corrupt
and
so
proud
in
their
corruption
she
had
already
seen
a
dozen
women
in
various
situations
of
conspicuousness
apply
powder
to
their
complexions
with
no
more
ado
than
if
they
had
been
giving
a
pat
to
their
hair
she
could
not
understand
such
boldness
as
for
them
they
marvelled
at
the
phenomena
presented
in
sophia
person
they
admired
they
admitted
the
style
of
the
gown
but
they
envied
neither
her
innocence
nor
her
beauty
they
envied
nothing
but
her
youth
and
the
fresh
tint
of
her
cheeks
encore
des
anglais
said
some
of
them
as
if
that
explained
all
gerald
had
a
very
curt
way
with
waiters
and
the
more
obsequious
they
were
the
haughtier
he
became
and
a
was
no
more
to
him
than
a
scullion
he
gave
orders
in
french
of
which
both
he
and
sophia
were
proud
and
a
table
was
laid
for
them
in
a
corner
near
one
of
the
large
windows
sophia
settled
herself
on
the
bench
of
green
velvet
and
began
to
ply
the
ivory
fan
which
gerald
had
given
her
it
was
very
hot
all
the
windows
were
wide
open
and
the
sounds
of
the
street
mingled
clearly
with
the
tinkle
of
the
outside
against
a
sky
of
deepest
purple
sophia
could
discern
the
black
skeleton
of
a
gigantic
building
it
was
the
new
opera
house
all
sorts
here
said
gerald
contentedly
after
he
had
ordered
iced
soup
and
sparkling
moselle
sophia
did
not
know
what
moselle
was
but
she
imagined
that
anything
would
be
better
than
champagne
sylvain
was
then
typical
of
the
second
empire
and
particularly
famous
as
a
expensive
and
gay
it
provided
with
its
discreet
decorations
a
sumptuous
scene
where
lorettes
actresses
respectable
women
and
an
occasional
grisette
in
luck
could
satisfy
their
curiosity
as
to
each
other
in
its
catholicity
it
was
highly
correct
as
a
resort
not
many
other
restaurants
in
the
centre
could
have
successfully
fought
against
the
rival
attractions
of
the
bois
and
the
dim
groves
of
the
champs
elysees
on
a
night
in
august
the
complicated
richness
of
the
dresses
the
yards
and
yards
of
fine
stitchery
the
endless
ruching
the
hints
more
or
less
incautious
of
nether
treasures
of
embroidered
linen
and
leaping
over
all
this
to
the
eye
the
vivid
colourings
of
silks
and
muslins
veils
plumes
and
flowers
piled
as
it
were
in
heaps
on
the
universal
green
cushions
to
the
furthest
vista
of
the
restaurant
and
all
multiplied
in
gilt
mirrors
the
spectacle
intoxicated
sophia
her
eyes
gleamed
she
drank
the
soup
with
eagerness
and
tasted
the
wine
though
no
desire
on
her
part
to
like
wine
could
make
her
like
it
and
then
seeing
pineapples
on
a
large
table
covered
with
fruits
she
told
gerald
that
she
should
like
some
pineapple
and
gerald
ordered
one
she
gathered
her
and
her
wits
together
and
began
to
give
gerald
her
views
on
the
costumes
she
could
do
so
with
impunity
because
her
own
was
indubitably
beyond
criticism
some
she
wholly
condemned
and
there
was
not
one
which
earned
her
unreserved
approval
all
the
absurd
fastidiousness
of
her
schoolgirlish
provinciality
emerged
in
that
eager
affected
torrent
of
remarks
however
she
was
clever
enough
to
read
after
a
time
in
gerald
tone
and
features
that
she
was
making
a
tedious
fool
of
herself
and
she
adroitly
shifted
her
criticism
from
the
taste
to
the
work
she
put
a
strong
accent
on
the
word
and
pronounced
that
to
be
miraculous
beyond
description
she
reckoned
that
she
knew
what
dressmaking
and
millinery
were
and
her
little
fund
of
expert
knowledge
caused
her
to
picture
a
whole
necessary
cityful
of
girls
stitching
stitching
and
stitching
day
and
night
she
had
wondered
during
the
few
odd
days
that
they
had
spent
in
paris
between
visits
to
chantilly
and
other
places
at
the
massed
luxury
of
the
shops
she
had
wondered
starting
with
luke
square
as
a
standard
how
they
could
all
thrive
but
now
in
her
first
real
glimpse
of
the
banal
and
licentious
profusion
of
one
among
a
hundred
restaurants
she
wondered
that
the
shops
were
so
few
she
thought
how
splendid
was
all
this
expensiveness
for
trade
indeed
the
notions
chasing
each
other
within
that
lovely
and
foolish
head
were
a
surprising
medley
well
what
do
you
think
of
sylvain
gerald
asked
impatient
to
be
assured
that
his
sylvain
had
duly
overwhelmed
her
oh
gerald
she
murmured
indicating
that
speech
was
inadequate
and
she
just
furtively
touched
his
hand
with
hers
the
ennui
due
to
her
critical
disquisition
on
the
shortcomings
of
parisian
costume
cleared
away
from
gerald
face
what
do
you
suppose
those
people
there
are
talking
about
he
said
with
a
jerk
of
the
head
towards
a
chattering
group
of
three
gorgeous
lorettes
and
two
men
at
the
next
table
but
one
what
are
they
talking
about
they
talking
about
the
execution
of
the
murderer
rivain
that
takes
place
at
auxerre
the
day
after
they
arranging
to
make
up
a
party
and
go
and
see
it
oh
what
a
horrid
idea
said
sophia
guillotine
you
know
said
gerald
but
can
people
see
it
yes
of
course
well
i
think
it
horrible
yes
that
why
people
like
to
go
and
see
it
besides
the
man
an
ordinary
sort
of
criminal
at
all
he
very
young
and
and
well
connected
and
he
killed
the
celebrated
claudine
claudine
claudine
jacquinot
of
course
you
would
know
she
was
a
tremendous
er
wrong
here
in
the
forties
made
a
lot
of
money
and
retired
to
her
native
town
sophia
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
maintain
the
role
of
a
woman
who
has
nothing
to
learn
blushed
then
she
was
older
than
he
is
years
older
if
a
day
what
did
he
kill
her
for
she
would
give
him
enough
money
she
was
his
mistress
or
rather
one
of
he
wanted
money
for
a
young
lady
friend
you
see
he
killed
her
and
took
all
the
jewels
she
was
wearing
whenever
he
went
to
see
her
she
always
wore
all
her
best
jewels
and
you
may
bet
a
woman
like
that
had
a
few
it
seems
she
had
been
afraid
for
a
long
time
that
he
meant
to
do
for
her
then
why
did
she
see
him
and
why
did
she
wear
her
jewels
because
she
liked
being
afraid
goose
some
women
only
enjoy
themselves
when
they
terrified
queer
is
it
gerald
insisted
on
meeting
his
wife
gaze
as
he
finished
these
revelations
he
pretended
that
such
stories
were
the
commonest
things
on
earth
and
that
to
be
scandalized
by
them
was
infantile
sophia
thrust
suddenly
into
a
strange
civilization
perfectly
frank
in
its
sensuality
and
its
sensuousness
under
the
guidance
of
a
young
man
to
whom
her
intelligence
was
a
most
diverting
toy
sophia
felt
mysteriously
uncomfortable
disturbed
by
sinister
flitting
phantoms
of
ideas
which
she
only
dimly
apprehended
her
eyes
fell
gerald
laughed
she
would
not
eat
any
more
pineapple
immediately
afterwards
there
came
into
the
restaurant
an
apparition
which
momentarily
stopped
every
conversation
in
the
room
it
was
a
tall
and
mature
woman
who
wore
over
a
dress
of
silk
a
vast
flowing
sortie
de
bal
of
vermilion
velvet
looped
and
tasselled
with
gold
no
other
costume
could
live
by
the
side
of
that
garment
arab
in
shape
russian
in
colour
and
parisian
in
style
it
blazed
the
heavy
coiffure
was
bound
with
fillets
of
gold
braid
and
crimson
rosettes
she
was
followed
by
a
young
englishman
in
evening
dress
and
whiskers
of
the
most
exact
correctness
the
woman
sailed
a
little
breathlessly
to
a
table
next
to
gerald
and
took
possession
of
it
with
an
air
of
use
almost
of
tedium
she
sat
down
threw
the
cloak
from
her
majestic
bosom
and
expanded
her
chest
seeming
to
ignore
the
englishman
who
superciliously
assumed
the
seat
opposite
to
her
she
let
her
large
scornful
eyes
travel
round
the
restaurant
slowly
and
imperiously
meeting
the
curiosity
which
she
had
evoked
her
beauty
had
undoubtedly
been
dazzling
it
was
still
effulgent
but
the
blossom
was
about
to
fall
she
was
admirably
rouged
and
powdered
her
arms
were
glorious
her
lashes
were
long
there
was
little
fault
save
the
excessive
ripeness
of
a
blonde
who
fights
in
vain
against
obesity
and
her
clothes
combined
audacity
with
the
propriety
of
fashion
she
carelessly
deposed
costly
trinkets
on
the
table
and
then
having
intimidated
the
whole
company
she
accepted
the
menu
from
the
and
began
to
study
it
that
one
of
gerald
whispered
to
sophia
one
of
what
sophia
whispered
gerald
raised
his
eyebrows
warningly
and
winked
the
englishman
had
overheard
and
a
look
of
frigid
displeasure
passed
across
his
proud
face
evidently
he
belonged
to
a
rank
much
higher
than
gerald
and
gerald
though
he
could
always
comfort
himself
by
the
thought
that
he
had
been
to
a
university
with
the
best
felt
his
own
inferiority
and
could
not
hide
that
he
felt
it
gerald
was
wealthy
he
came
of
a
wealthy
family
but
he
had
not
the
habit
of
wealth
when
he
spent
money
furiously
he
did
it
with
bravado
too
conscious
of
grandeur
and
too
conscious
of
the
difficulties
of
acquiring
that
which
he
threw
away
for
gerald
had
earned
money
this
whiskered
englishman
had
never
earned
money
never
known
the
value
of
it
never
imagined
himself
without
as
much
of
it
as
he
might
happen
to
want
he
had
the
face
of
one
accustomed
to
give
orders
and
to
look
down
upon
inferiors
he
was
absolutely
sure
of
himself
that
his
companion
chiefly
ignored
him
did
not
appear
to
incommode
him
in
the
least
she
spoke
to
him
in
french
he
replied
in
english
very
briefly
and
then
in
english
he
commanded
the
supper
as
soon
as
the
champagne
was
served
he
began
to
drink
in
the
intervals
of
drinking
he
gently
stroked
his
whiskers
the
woman
spoke
no
more
gerald
talked
more
loudly
with
that
aristocratic
englishman
observing
him
he
could
not
remain
at
ease
and
not
only
did
he
talk
more
loudly
he
brought
into
his
conversation
references
to
money
travels
and
worldly
experiences
while
seeking
to
impress
the
englishman
he
was
merely
becoming
ridiculous
to
the
englishman
and
obscurely
he
was
aware
of
this
sophia
noticed
and
regretted
it
still
feeling
very
unimportant
herself
she
was
reconciled
to
the
superiority
of
the
whiskered
englishman
as
to
a
natural
fact
gerald
behaviour
slightly
lowered
him
in
her
esteem
then
she
looked
at
him
at
his
neatness
his
vivacious
face
his
excellent
clothes
and
decided
that
he
was
much
to
be
preferred
to
any
aristocrat
alive
the
woman
whose
vermilion
cloak
lay
around
her
like
a
fortification
spoke
to
her
escort
he
did
not
understand
he
tried
to
express
himself
in
french
and
failed
then
the
woman
recommenced
talking
at
length
when
she
had
done
he
shook
his
head
his
acquaintance
with
french
was
limited
to
the
vocabulary
of
food
guillotine
he
murmured
the
sole
word
of
her
discourse
that
he
had
understood
oui
oui
guillotine
enfin
cried
the
woman
excitedly
encouraged
by
her
success
in
conveying
even
one
word
of
her
remarks
she
began
a
third
time
excuse
me
said
gerald
madame
is
talking
about
the
execution
at
auxerre
the
day
after
madame
que
vous
parliez
de
rivain
the
englishman
glared
angrily
at
gerald
officious
interruption
but
the
woman
smiled
benevolently
on
gerald
and
insisted
on
talking
to
her
friend
through
him
and
the
englishman
had
to
make
the
best
of
the
situation
there
is
a
restaurant
in
paris
where
they
are
talking
about
that
execution
said
gerald
on
his
own
account
indeed
observed
the
englishman
wine
affected
them
in
different
ways
now
a
fragile
short
young
frenchman
with
an
extremely
pale
face
ending
in
a
thin
black
imperial
appeared
at
the
entrance
he
looked
about
and
recognizing
the
woman
of
the
scarlet
cloak
very
discreetly
saluted
her
then
he
saw
gerald
and
his
worn
fatigued
features
showed
a
sudden
startled
smile
he
came
rapidly
forward
hat
in
hand
seized
gerald
palm
and
greeted
him
effusively
my
wife
said
gerald
with
the
solemn
care
of
a
man
who
is
determined
to
prove
that
he
is
entirely
sober
the
young
man
became
grave
and
excessively
ceremonious
he
bowed
low
over
sophia
hand
and
kissed
it
her
impulse
was
to
laugh
but
the
gravity
of
the
young
man
deference
stopped
her
she
glanced
at
gerald
blushing
as
if
to
say
this
comedy
is
not
my
fault
gerald
said
something
the
young
man
turned
to
him
and
his
face
resumed
its
welcoming
smile
this
is
monsieur
chirac
gerald
at
length
completed
the
introduction
a
friend
of
mine
when
i
lived
in
paris
he
was
proud
to
have
met
by
accident
an
acquaintance
in
a
restaurant
it
demonstrated
that
he
was
a
parisian
and
improved
his
standing
with
the
whiskered
englishman
and
the
vermilion
cloak
it
is
the
first
time
you
come
paris
madame
chirac
addressed
himself
to
sophia
in
limping
timorous
english
yes
she
giggled
he
bowed
again
chirac
with
his
best
compliments
felicitated
gerald
upon
his
marriage
do
mention
it
said
the
humorous
gerald
in
english
amused
at
his
own
wit
and
then
what
about
this
execution
ah
replied
chirac
breathing
out
a
long
breath
and
smiling
at
sophia
rivain
rivain
he
made
a
large
important
gesture
with
his
hand
it
was
at
once
to
be
seen
that
gerald
had
touched
the
topic
which
secretly
ravaged
the
as
a
subterranean
fire
ravages
a
mine
i
go
said
chirac
with
pride
glancing
at
sophia
who
smiled
chirac
entered
upon
a
conversation
with
gerald
in
french
sophia
comprehended
that
gerald
was
surprised
and
impressed
by
what
chirac
told
him
and
that
chirac
in
turn
was
surprised
then
gerald
laboriously
found
his
and
after
some
fumbling
with
it
handed
it
to
chirac
so
that
the
latter
might
write
in
it
madame
murmured
chirac
resuming
his
ceremonious
stiffness
in
order
to
take
leave
alors
entendu
mon
cher
ami
he
said
to
gerald
who
nodded
phlegmatically
and
chirac
went
away
to
the
next
table
but
one
where
were
the
three
lorettes
and
the
two
men
he
was
received
there
with
enthusiasm
sophia
began
to
be
teased
by
a
little
fear
that
gerald
was
not
quite
his
usual
self
she
did
not
think
of
him
as
tipsy
the
idea
of
his
being
tipsy
would
have
shocked
her
she
did
not
think
clearly
at
all
she
was
lost
and
dazed
in
the
labyrinth
of
new
and
vivid
impressions
into
which
gerald
had
led
her
but
her
prudence
was
awake
i
think
i
tired
she
said
in
a
low
voice
you
do
want
to
go
do
you
he
asked
hurt
well
oh
wait
a
bit
the
owner
of
the
vermilion
cloak
spoke
again
to
gerald
who
showed
that
he
was
flattered
while
talking
to
her
he
ordered
a
and
then
he
could
not
refrain
from
displaying
to
her
his
familiarity
with
parisian
life
and
he
related
how
he
had
met
hortense
schneider
behind
a
pair
of
white
horses
the
vermilion
cloak
grew
even
more
sociable
at
the
mention
of
this
resounding
name
and
chattered
with
the
most
agreeable
vivacity
her
friend
stared
inimically
do
you
hear
that
gerald
explained
to
sophia
who
was
sitting
silent
about
hortense
schneider
you
know
we
met
her
it
seems
she
made
a
bet
of
a
louis
with
some
fellow
and
when
he
lost
he
sent
her
the
louis
set
in
diamonds
worth
a
hundred
thousand
francs
that
how
they
go
on
here
oh
cried
sophia
further
than
ever
in
the
labyrinth
me
the
englishman
put
in
heavily
he
had
heard
the
words
schneider
schneider
repeating
themselves
in
the
conversation
and
at
last
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
the
conversation
was
about
hortense
schneider
me
he
began
again
are
you
do
you
mean
hortense
schneider
yes
said
gerald
we
met
her
she
in
trouville
said
the
englishman
flatly
gerald
shook
his
head
positively
i
gave
a
supper
to
her
in
trouville
last
night
said
the
englishman
and
she
plays
at
the
casino
theatre
gerald
was
repulsed
but
not
defeated
what
is
she
playing
in
tell
me
that
he
sneered
i
do
see
why
i
sh
tell
you
hm
gerald
retorted
if
what
you
say
is
true
it
a
very
strange
thing
i
should
have
seen
her
in
the
champs
elysees
is
it
the
englishman
drank
more
wine
if
you
want
to
insult
me
sir
he
began
coldly
gerald
sophia
urged
in
a
whisper
be
quiet
gerald
snapped
a
fiddler
in
fancy
costume
plunged
into
the
restaurant
at
that
moment
and
began
to
play
wildly
the
shock
of
his
strange
advent
momentarily
silenced
the
quarrel
but
soon
it
leaped
up
again
under
the
shelter
of
the
noisy
music
the
common
tedious
tippler
quarrel
it
rose
higher
and
higher
the
fiddler
looked
askance
at
it
over
his
fiddle
chirac
cautiously
observed
it
instead
of
attending
to
the
music
the
festal
company
attended
to
the
quarrel
three
waiters
in
a
group
watched
it
with
an
impartial
sporting
interest
the
english
voices
grew
more
menacing
then
suddenly
the
whiskered
englishman
jerking
his
head
towards
the
door
said
more
quietly
had
we
better
settle
thish
outside
at
your
service
said
gerald
rising
the
owner
of
the
vermilion
cloak
lifted
her
eyebrows
to
chirac
in
fatigued
disgust
but
she
said
nothing
nor
did
sophia
say
anything
sophia
was
overcome
by
terror
the
swain
of
the
cloak
dragging
his
coat
after
him
across
the
floor
left
the
restaurant
without
offering
any
apology
or
explanation
to
his
lady
wait
here
for
me
said
gerald
defiantly
to
sophia
i
shall
be
back
in
a
minute
but
gerald
she
put
her
hand
on
his
sleeve
he
snatched
his
arm
away
wait
here
for
me
i
tell
you
he
repeated
the
doorkeeper
obsequiously
opened
the
door
to
the
two
unsteady
carousers
for
whom
the
fiddler
drew
back
still
playing
thus
sophia
was
left
side
by
side
with
the
vermilion
cloak
she
was
quite
helpless
all
the
pride
of
a
married
woman
had
abandoned
her
she
stood
transfixed
by
intense
shame
staring
painfully
at
a
pillar
to
avoid
the
universal
assault
of
eyes
she
felt
like
an
indiscreet
little
girl
and
she
looked
like
one
no
youthful
radiant
beauty
of
features
no
grace
and
style
of
a
parisian
dress
no
certificate
of
a
ring
no
premature
initiation
into
the
mysteries
could
save
her
from
the
appearance
of
a
raw
fool
whose
foolishness
had
been
her
undoing
her
face
changed
to
its
reddest
and
remained
at
that
and
all
the
fundamental
innocence
of
her
nature
which
had
been
overlaid
by
the
violent
experiences
of
her
brief
companionship
with
gerald
rose
again
to
the
surface
with
that
blush
her
situation
drew
pity
from
a
few
hearts
and
a
careless
contempt
from
the
rest
but
since
once
more
it
was
a
question
of
ces
anglais
nobody
could
be
astonished
without
moving
her
head
she
twisted
her
eyes
to
the
clock
two
the
fiddler
ceased
his
dance
and
made
a
collection
in
his
tasselled
cap
the
vermilion
cloak
threw
a
coin
into
the
cap
sophia
stared
at
it
moveless
until
the
fiddler
tired
of
waiting
passed
to
the
next
table
and
relieved
her
agony
she
had
no
money
at
all
she
set
herself
to
watch
the
clock
but
its
fingers
would
not
stir
with
an
exclamation
the
lady
of
the
cloak
got
up
and
peered
out
of
the
window
chatted
with
waiters
and
then
removed
herself
and
her
cloak
to
the
next
table
where
she
was
received
with
amiable
sympathy
by
the
three
lorettes
chirac
and
the
other
two
men
the
party
surreptitiously
examined
sophia
from
time
to
time
then
chirac
went
outside
with
the
returned
consulted
with
his
friends
and
finally
approached
sophia
it
was
twenty
minutes
past
three
he
renewed
his
magnificent
bow
madame
he
said
carefully
will
you
allow
me
to
bring
you
to
your
hotel
he
made
no
reference
to
gerald
partly
doubtless
because
his
english
was
treacherous
on
difficult
ground
sophia
had
not
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
thank
her
saviour
but
the
bill
she
stammered
the
bill
is
paid
he
did
not
instantly
understand
her
but
one
of
the
waiters
had
caught
the
sound
of
a
familiar
word
and
sprang
forward
with
a
slip
of
paper
on
a
plate
i
have
no
money
said
sophia
with
a
feeble
smile
je
vous
arrangerai
ca
he
said
what
name
of
the
hotel
meurice
is
it
not
hotel
meurice
said
sophia
yes
he
spoke
to
the
about
the
bill
which
was
carried
away
like
something
obscene
and
on
his
arm
which
he
punctiliously
offered
and
she
could
not
refuse
sophia
left
the
scene
of
her
ignominy
she
was
so
distraught
that
she
could
not
manage
her
crinoline
in
the
doorway
no
sign
anywhere
outside
of
gerald
or
his
foe
he
put
her
into
an
open
carriage
and
in
five
minutes
they
had
clattered
down
the
brilliant
silence
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
through
the
place
vendome
into
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
the
of
the
hotel
was
at
the
i
tell
them
at
the
restaurant
where
you
gone
said
chirac
under
the
long
colonnade
of
the
street
if
your
husband
is
there
i
tell
him
till
his
manners
were
more
wonderful
than
any
that
sophia
had
ever
imagined
he
might
have
been
in
the
dark
tuileries
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
saluting
an
empress
instead
of
taking
leave
of
a
raw
little
girl
who
was
still
too
disturbed
even
to
thank
him
she
fled
candle
in
hand
up
the
wide
stairs
gerald
might
be
already
in
the
bedroom
drunk
there
was
a
chance
but
the
bedroom
was
empty
she
sat
down
at
the
table
amid
the
shadows
cast
by
the
candle
that
wavered
in
the
draught
from
the
open
window
and
she
set
her
teeth
and
a
cold
fury
possessed
her
in
the
hot
and
languorous
night
gerald
was
an
imbecile
that
he
should
have
allowed
himself
to
get
tipsy
was
bad
enough
but
that
he
should
have
exposed
her
to
the
horrible
situation
from
which
chirac
had
extricated
her
was
unspeakably
disgraceful
he
was
an
imbecile
he
had
no
common
sense
with
all
his
captivating
charm
he
could
not
be
relied
upon
not
to
make
himself
and
her
ridiculous
tragically
ridiculous
compare
him
with
chirac
she
leaned
despairingly
on
the
table
she
would
not
undress
she
would
not
move
she
had
to
realize
her
position
she
had
to
see
it
folly
folly
fancy
a
commercial
traveller
throwing
a
compromising
piece
of
paper
to
the
daughter
of
his
customer
in
the
shop
itself
that
was
the
incredible
folly
with
which
their
relations
had
begun
and
his
mad
gesture
at
the
and
his
scheme
for
bringing
her
to
paris
unmarried
and
then
monstrous
folly
alone
in
the
bedroom
she
was
a
wise
and
a
disillusioned
woman
wiser
than
any
of
those
dolls
in
the
restaurant
and
had
she
not
gone
to
gerald
as
it
were
over
the
dead
body
of
her
father
through
lies
and
lies
and
again
lies
that
was
how
she
phrased
it
to
herself
over
the
dead
body
of
her
father
how
could
such
a
venture
succeed
how
could
she
ever
have
hoped
that
it
would
succeed
in
that
moment
she
saw
her
acts
with
the
terrible
vision
of
a
hebrew
prophet
she
thought
of
the
square
and
of
her
life
there
with
her
mother
and
constance
never
would
her
pride
allow
her
to
return
to
that
life
not
even
if
the
worst
happened
to
her
that
could
happen
she
was
one
of
those
who
are
prepared
to
pay
without
grumbling
for
what
they
have
had
there
was
a
sound
outside
she
noticed
that
the
dawn
had
begun
the
door
opened
and
disclosed
gerald
they
exchanged
a
searching
glance
and
gerald
shut
the
door
gerald
infected
the
air
but
she
perceived
at
once
that
he
was
sobered
his
lip
was
bleeding
chirac
brought
me
home
she
said
so
it
seems
said
gerald
curtly
i
asked
you
to
wait
for
me
i
say
i
should
come
back
he
was
adopting
the
injured
magisterial
tone
of
the
man
who
is
ridiculously
trying
to
conceal
from
himself
and
others
that
he
has
recently
behaved
like
an
ass
she
resented
the
injustice
i
do
think
you
need
talk
like
that
she
said
like
what
he
bullied
her
determined
that
she
should
be
in
the
wrong
and
what
a
hard
look
on
his
pretty
face
her
prudence
bade
her
accept
the
injustice
she
was
his
rapt
away
from
her
own
world
she
was
utterly
dependent
on
his
good
nature
i
knocked
my
chin
against
the
damned
balustrade
coming
upstairs
said
gerald
gloomily
she
knew
that
was
a
lie
did
you
she
replied
kindly
let
me
bathe
it
chapter
iii
an
ambition
satisfied
i
she
went
to
sleep
in
misery
all
the
glory
of
her
new
life
had
been
eclipsed
but
when
she
woke
up
a
few
hours
later
in
the
large
velvety
stateliness
of
the
bedroom
for
which
gerald
was
paying
so
fantastic
a
price
per
day
she
was
in
a
brighter
mood
and
very
willing
to
reconsider
her
verdicts
her
pride
induced
her
to
put
gerald
in
the
right
and
herself
in
the
wrong
for
she
was
too
proud
to
admit
that
she
had
married
a
charming
and
irresponsible
fool
and
indeed
ought
she
not
to
put
herself
in
the
wrong
gerald
had
told
her
to
wait
and
she
had
not
waited
he
had
said
that
he
should
return
to
the
restaurant
and
he
had
returned
why
had
she
not
waited
she
had
not
waited
because
she
had
behaved
like
a
simpleton
she
had
been
terrified
about
nothing
had
she
not
been
frequenting
restaurants
now
for
a
month
past
ought
not
a
married
woman
to
be
capable
of
waiting
an
hour
in
a
restaurant
for
her
lawful
husband
without
looking
a
ninny
and
as
for
behaviour
how
could
he
have
acted
differently
the
other
englishman
was
obviously
a
brute
and
had
sought
a
quarrel
his
contradiction
of
gerald
statements
was
extremely
offensive
on
being
invited
by
the
brute
to
go
outside
what
could
gerald
do
but
comply
not
to
have
complied
might
have
meant
a
fight
in
the
restaurant
as
the
brute
was
certainly
drunk
compared
to
the
brute
gerald
was
not
at
all
drunk
merely
a
little
gay
and
talkative
then
gerald
fib
about
his
chin
was
natural
he
simply
wished
to
minimize
the
fuss
and
to
spare
her
feelings
it
was
in
fact
just
like
gerald
to
keep
perfect
silence
as
to
what
had
passed
between
himself
and
the
brute
however
she
was
convinced
that
gerald
so
lithe
and
quick
had
given
that
great
brute
with
his
supercilious
ways
as
good
as
he
received
if
not
better
and
if
she
were
a
man
and
had
asked
her
wife
to
wait
in
a
restaurant
and
the
wife
had
gone
home
under
the
escort
of
another
man
she
would
most
assuredly
be
much
more
angry
than
gerald
had
been
she
was
very
glad
that
she
had
controlled
herself
and
exercised
a
meek
diplomacy
a
quarrel
had
thus
been
avoided
yes
the
finish
of
the
evening
could
not
be
called
a
quarrel
after
her
nursing
of
his
chin
nothing
but
a
slight
coolness
on
his
part
had
persisted
she
arose
silently
and
began
to
dress
full
of
a
determination
to
treat
gerald
as
a
good
wife
ought
to
treat
a
husband
gerald
did
not
stir
he
was
an
excellent
sleeper
one
of
those
organisms
that
never
want
to
go
to
bed
and
never
want
to
get
up
when
her
toilet
was
complete
save
for
her
bodice
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
she
started
gerald
she
approached
the
bed
and
leaned
her
nude
bosom
over
her
husband
and
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
this
method
of
being
brought
back
to
consciousness
did
not
displease
him
the
knock
was
repeated
he
gave
a
grunt
some
one
knocking
at
the
door
she
whispered
then
why
do
you
open
it
he
asked
dreamily
i
not
dressed
darling
he
looked
at
her
stick
something
on
your
shoulders
girl
said
he
what
does
it
matter
there
she
was
being
a
simpleton
again
despite
her
resolution
she
obeyed
and
cautiously
opened
the
door
standing
behind
it
a
whiskered
servant
in
a
long
white
apron
announced
matters
in
french
which
passed
her
understanding
but
gerald
had
heard
from
the
bed
and
he
replied
bien
monsieur
the
servant
departed
with
a
bow
down
the
obscure
corridor
it
chirac
gerald
explained
when
she
had
shut
the
door
i
was
forgetting
i
asked
him
to
come
and
have
lunch
with
us
early
waiting
in
the
just
put
your
bodice
on
and
go
and
talk
to
him
till
i
come
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
then
standing
in
his
stretched
himself
and
terrifically
yawned
me
sophia
questioned
who
else
said
gerald
with
that
curious
satiric
dryness
which
he
would
sometimes
import
into
his
tone
but
i
ca
speak
french
she
protested
i
did
suppose
you
could
said
gerald
with
an
increase
of
dryness
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
he
can
speak
english
oh
very
well
then
she
murmured
with
agreeable
alacrity
evidently
gerald
had
not
yet
quite
recovered
from
his
legitimate
displeasure
of
the
night
he
minutely
examined
his
mouth
in
the
glass
of
the
louis
philippe
wardrobe
it
showed
scarcely
a
trace
of
battle
i
say
he
stopped
her
as
nervous
at
the
prospect
before
her
she
was
leaving
the
room
i
was
thinking
of
going
to
auxerre
auxerre
she
repeated
wondering
under
what
circumstances
she
had
recently
heard
that
name
then
she
remembered
it
was
the
place
of
execution
of
the
murderer
rivain
yes
he
said
chirac
has
to
go
he
on
a
newspaper
now
he
was
an
architect
when
i
knew
him
he
got
to
go
and
he
thinks
himself
jolly
lucky
so
i
thought
i
go
with
him
the
truth
was
that
he
had
definitely
arranged
to
go
not
to
see
the
execution
she
stammered
why
not
i
always
wanted
to
see
an
execution
especially
with
the
guillotine
and
executions
are
public
in
france
it
quite
the
proper
thing
to
go
to
them
but
why
do
you
want
to
see
an
execution
it
just
happens
that
i
do
want
to
see
an
execution
it
a
fancy
of
mine
that
all
i
do
know
that
any
reason
is
necessary
he
said
pouring
out
water
into
the
diminutive
ewer
she
was
aghast
and
shall
you
leave
me
here
alone
well
said
he
i
do
see
why
my
being
married
should
prevent
me
from
doing
something
that
i
always
wanted
to
do
do
you
oh
no
she
eagerly
concurred
that
all
right
he
said
you
can
do
exactly
as
you
like
either
stay
here
or
come
with
me
if
you
go
to
auxerre
there
no
need
at
all
for
you
to
see
the
execution
it
an
interesting
old
town
cathedral
and
so
on
but
of
course
if
you
ca
bear
to
be
in
the
same
town
as
a
guillotine
i
go
alone
i
shall
come
back
it
was
plain
where
his
wish
lay
she
stopped
the
phrases
that
came
to
her
lips
and
did
her
best
to
dismiss
the
thoughts
which
prompted
them
of
course
i
go
she
said
quietly
she
hesitated
and
then
went
up
to
the
washstand
and
kissed
a
part
of
his
cheek
that
was
not
soapy
that
kiss
which
comforted
and
somehow
reassured
her
was
the
expression
of
a
surrender
whose
monstrousness
she
would
not
admit
to
herself
in
the
rich
and
dusty
chirac
and
chirac
exquisite
formalities
awaited
her
nobody
else
was
there
my
husband
she
began
smiling
and
blushing
she
liked
chirac
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
had
the
opportunity
of
using
that
word
to
other
than
a
servant
it
soothed
her
and
gave
her
confidence
she
perceived
after
a
few
moments
that
chirac
did
genuinely
admire
her
more
that
she
inspired
him
with
something
that
resembled
awe
speaking
very
slowly
and
distinctly
she
said
that
she
should
travel
with
her
husband
to
auxerre
as
he
saw
no
objection
to
that
course
implying
that
if
he
saw
no
objection
she
was
perfectly
satisfied
chirac
was
concurrence
itself
in
five
minutes
it
seemed
to
be
the
most
natural
and
proper
thing
in
the
world
that
on
her
honeymoon
she
should
be
going
with
her
husband
to
a
particular
town
because
a
notorious
murderer
was
about
to
be
decapitated
there
in
public
my
husband
has
always
wanted
to
see
an
execution
she
said
later
it
would
be
a
pity
to
as
psychological
experience
replied
chirac
pronouncing
the
p
of
the
adjective
it
will
be
very
interessant
to
observe
one
self
in
such
circumstances
he
smiled
enthusiastically
she
thought
how
strange
even
nice
frenchmen
were
imagine
going
to
an
execution
in
order
to
observe
yourself
ii
what
continually
impressed
sophia
as
strange
in
the
behaviour
not
only
of
gerald
but
of
chirac
and
other
people
with
whom
she
came
into
contact
was
its
quality
of
casualness
she
had
all
her
life
been
accustomed
to
see
enterprises
even
minor
ones
well
pondered
and
then
carefully
schemed
beforehand
in
luke
square
there
was
always
in
every
head
a
sort
of
of
existence
prepared
at
least
one
week
in
advance
but
in
gerald
world
nothing
was
prearranged
elaborate
affairs
were
decided
in
a
moment
and
undertaken
with
extraordinary
lightness
thus
the
excursion
to
auxerre
during
lunch
scarcely
a
word
was
said
as
to
it
the
conversation
in
english
for
sophia
advantage
turning
as
usual
under
such
circumstances
upon
the
difficulty
of
languages
and
the
differences
between
countries
nobody
would
have
guessed
that
any
member
of
the
party
had
any
preoccupation
whatever
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
meal
was
delightful
to
sophia
not
merely
did
she
find
chirac
comfortingly
kind
and
sincere
but
gerald
was
restored
to
the
perfection
of
his
charm
and
his
good
humour
then
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
coffee
the
question
of
trains
loomed
up
like
a
swift
crisis
in
five
minutes
chirac
had
departed
whether
to
his
office
or
his
home
sophia
did
not
understand
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
and
gerald
were
driving
rapidly
to
the
gare
de
lyon
gerald
stuffing
into
his
pocket
a
large
envelope
full
of
papers
which
he
had
received
by
registered
post
they
caught
the
train
by
about
a
minute
and
chirac
by
a
few
seconds
yet
neither
he
nor
gerald
seemed
to
envisage
the
risk
of
inconvenience
and
annoyance
which
they
had
incurred
and
escaped
chirac
chattered
through
the
window
with
another
journalist
in
the
next
compartment
when
she
had
leisure
to
examine
him
sophia
saw
that
he
must
have
called
at
his
home
to
put
on
old
clothes
everybody
except
herself
and
gerald
seemed
to
travel
in
his
oldest
clothes
the
train
was
hot
noisy
and
dusty
but
one
after
another
all
three
of
them
fell
asleep
and
slept
heavily
calmly
like
healthy
and
exhausted
young
animals
nothing
could
disturb
them
for
more
than
a
moment
to
sophia
it
appeared
to
be
by
simple
chance
that
chirac
aroused
himself
and
them
at
laroche
and
sleepily
seized
her
valise
and
got
them
all
out
on
the
platform
where
they
yawned
and
smiled
full
of
the
deep
satisfaction
of
repose
they
drank
nectar
from
a
wheeled
buffet
drank
it
eagerly
in
thirsty
gulps
and
sighed
with
pleasure
and
relief
and
gerald
threw
down
a
coin
refusing
change
with
a
lord
gesture
the
local
train
to
auxerre
was
full
and
with
a
varied
and
sinister
cargo
at
length
they
were
in
the
zone
of
the
waiting
guillotine
the
rumour
ran
that
the
executioner
was
on
the
train
no
one
had
seen
him
no
one
was
sure
of
recognizing
him
but
everyone
hugged
the
belief
that
he
was
on
the
train
although
the
sun
was
sinking
the
heat
seemed
not
to
abate
attitudes
grew
more
limp
more
abandoned
soot
and
prickly
dust
flew
in
unceasingly
at
the
open
windows
the
train
stopped
at
bonnard
chemilly
and
moneteau
each
time
before
a
waiting
crowd
that
invaded
it
and
at
last
in
the
great
station
at
auxerre
it
poured
out
an
incredible
mass
of
befouled
humanity
that
spread
over
everything
like
an
inundation
sophia
was
frightened
gerald
left
the
initiative
to
chirac
and
chirac
took
her
arm
and
led
her
forward
looking
behind
him
to
see
that
gerald
followed
with
the
valise
frenzy
seemed
to
reign
in
auxerre
the
driver
of
a
cab
demanded
ten
francs
for
transporting
them
to
the
hotel
de
bah
scornfully
exclaimed
chirac
in
his
quality
of
experienced
parisian
who
is
not
to
be
exploited
by
provincials
but
the
driver
of
the
next
cab
demanded
twelve
francs
jump
in
said
gerald
to
sophia
chirac
lifted
his
eyebrows
at
the
same
moment
a
tall
stout
man
with
the
hard
face
of
a
flourishing
scoundrel
and
a
young
pallid
girl
on
his
arm
pushed
aside
both
gerald
and
chirac
and
got
into
the
cab
with
his
companion
chirac
protested
telling
him
that
the
cab
was
already
engaged
the
usurper
scowled
and
swore
and
the
young
girl
laughed
boldly
sophia
shrinking
expected
her
escort
to
execute
justice
heroic
and
final
but
she
was
disappointed
brute
murmured
chirac
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
the
carriage
drove
off
leaving
them
foolish
on
the
kerb
by
this
time
all
the
other
cabs
had
been
seized
they
walked
to
the
hotel
de
jostled
by
the
crowd
sophia
and
chirac
in
front
and
gerald
following
with
the
valise
whose
weight
caused
him
to
lean
over
to
the
right
and
his
left
arm
to
rise
the
avenue
was
long
straight
and
misty
with
a
floating
dust
sophia
had
a
vivid
sense
of
the
romantic
they
saw
towers
and
spires
and
chirac
talked
to
her
slowly
and
carefully
of
the
cathedral
and
the
famous
churches
he
said
that
the
stained
glass
was
marvellous
and
with
much
care
he
catalogued
for
her
all
the
things
she
must
visit
they
crossed
a
river
she
felt
as
though
she
was
stepping
into
the
middle
age
at
intervals
gerald
changed
the
valise
from
hand
to
hand
obstinately
he
would
not
let
chirac
touch
it
they
struggled
upwards
through
narrow
curving
streets
voila
said
chirac
they
were
in
front
of
the
hotel
de
across
the
street
was
a
cafe
crammed
with
people
several
carriages
stood
in
front
the
hotel
de
had
a
reassuring
air
of
mellow
respectability
such
as
chirac
had
claimed
for
it
he
had
suggested
this
hotel
for
madame
scales
because
it
was
not
near
the
place
of
execution
gerald
had
said
of
course
of
course
chirac
who
did
not
mean
to
go
to
bed
required
no
room
for
himself
the
hotel
de
had
one
room
to
offer
at
the
price
of
francs
gerald
revolted
at
the
attempted
imposition
a
nice
thing
he
grumbled
that
ordinary
travellers
ca
get
a
decent
room
at
a
decent
price
just
because
some
one
going
to
be
guillotined
try
elsewhere
his
features
expressed
disgust
but
sophia
fancied
that
he
was
secretly
pleased
they
swaggered
out
of
the
busy
stir
of
the
hotel
as
those
must
who
having
declined
to
be
swindled
wish
to
preserve
their
importance
in
the
face
of
the
world
in
the
street
a
cabman
solicited
them
and
filled
them
with
hope
by
saying
that
he
knew
of
a
hotel
that
might
suit
them
and
would
drive
them
there
for
five
francs
he
furiously
lashed
his
horse
the
mere
fact
of
being
in
a
swiftly
moving
carriage
which
wayfarers
had
to
avoid
nimbly
maintained
their
spirits
they
had
a
near
glimpse
of
the
cathedral
the
cab
halted
with
a
bump
in
a
small
square
in
front
of
a
repellent
building
which
bore
the
sign
de
vezelay
the
horse
was
bleeding
gerald
instructed
sophia
to
remain
where
she
was
and
he
and
chirac
went
up
four
stone
steps
into
the
hotel
sophia
stared
at
by
loose
crowds
that
were
promenading
gazed
about
her
and
saw
that
all
the
windows
of
the
square
were
open
and
most
of
them
occupied
by
people
who
laughed
and
chattered
then
there
was
a
shout
gerald
voice
he
had
appeared
at
a
window
on
the
second
floor
of
the
hotel
with
chirac
and
a
very
fat
woman
chirac
saluted
and
gerald
laughed
carelessly
and
nodded
it
all
right
said
gerald
having
descended
how
much
do
they
ask
sophia
inquired
indiscreetly
gerald
hesitated
and
looked
francs
he
said
but
i
had
enough
of
driving
about
it
seems
we
lucky
to
get
it
even
at
that
and
chirac
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
if
to
indicate
that
the
situation
and
the
price
ought
to
be
accepted
philosophically
gerald
gave
the
driver
five
francs
he
examined
the
piece
and
demanded
a
pourboire
oh
damn
said
gerald
and
because
he
had
no
smaller
change
parted
with
another
two
francs
is
any
one
coming
out
for
this
damned
valise
gerald
demanded
like
a
tyrant
whose
wrath
would
presently
fall
if
the
populace
did
not
instantly
set
about
minding
their
p
and
q
but
nobody
emerged
and
he
was
compelled
to
carry
the
bag
himself
the
hotel
was
dark
and
malodorous
and
every
room
seemed
to
be
crowded
with
giggling
groups
of
drinkers
we
ca
both
sleep
in
this
bed
surely
said
sophia
when
chirac
having
remained
downstairs
she
faced
gerald
in
a
small
mean
bedroom
you
do
suppose
i
shall
go
to
bed
do
you
said
gerald
rather
brusquely
it
for
you
we
going
to
eat
now
look
sharp
iii
it
was
night
she
lay
in
the
narrow
bed
the
heavy
crimson
curtains
had
been
drawn
across
the
dirty
lace
curtains
of
the
window
but
the
lights
of
the
little
square
faintly
penetrated
through
chinks
into
the
room
the
sounds
of
the
square
also
penetrated
extraordinarily
loud
and
clear
for
the
unabated
heat
had
compelled
her
to
leave
the
window
open
she
could
not
sleep
exhausted
though
she
was
there
was
no
hope
of
her
being
able
to
sleep
once
again
she
was
profoundly
depressed
she
remembered
the
dinner
with
horror
the
long
crowded
table
with
ends
in
the
oppressive
and
reeking
lighted
by
there
must
have
been
at
least
forty
people
at
that
table
most
of
them
ate
disgustingly
as
noisily
as
pigs
with
the
ends
of
the
large
coarse
napkins
tucked
in
at
their
necks
all
the
service
was
done
by
the
fat
woman
whom
she
had
seen
at
the
window
with
gerald
and
a
young
girl
whose
demeanour
was
candidly
brazen
both
these
creatures
were
slatterns
everything
was
dirty
but
the
food
was
good
chirac
and
gerald
were
agreed
that
the
food
was
good
as
well
as
the
wine
remarquable
chirac
had
said
of
the
wine
sophia
however
could
neither
eat
nor
drink
with
relish
she
was
afraid
the
company
shocked
her
by
its
gestures
alone
it
was
very
heterogeneous
in
appearance
some
of
the
diners
being
well
dressed
approaching
elegance
and
others
shabby
but
all
the
faces
to
the
youngest
were
brutalized
corrupt
and
shameless
the
juxtaposition
of
old
men
and
young
women
was
odious
to
her
especially
when
those
pairs
kissed
as
they
did
frequently
towards
the
end
of
the
meal
happily
she
was
placed
between
chirac
and
gerald
that
situation
seemed
to
shelter
her
even
from
the
conversation
she
would
have
comprehended
nothing
of
the
conversation
had
it
not
been
for
the
presence
of
a
englishman
who
sat
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
table
with
a
youngish
stylish
frenchwoman
whom
she
had
seen
at
sylvain
on
the
previous
night
the
englishman
was
evidently
under
a
promise
to
teach
english
to
the
frenchwoman
he
kept
translating
for
her
into
english
slowly
and
distinctly
and
she
would
repeat
the
phrases
after
him
with
strange
contortions
of
the
mouth
thus
sophia
gathered
that
the
talk
was
exclusively
about
assassinations
executions
criminals
and
executioners
some
of
the
people
there
made
a
practice
of
attending
every
execution
they
were
fountains
of
interesting
gossip
and
the
lions
of
the
meal
there
was
a
woman
who
could
recall
the
dying
words
of
all
the
victims
of
justice
for
twenty
years
past
the
table
roared
with
hysteric
laughter
at
one
of
this
woman
anecdotes
sophia
learned
that
she
had
related
how
a
criminal
had
said
to
the
priest
who
was
trying
to
screen
the
sight
of
the
guillotine
from
him
with
his
body
stand
away
now
parson
have
i
paid
to
see
it
such
was
the
englishman
rendering
the
wages
of
the
executioners
and
their
assistants
were
discussed
and
differences
of
opinions
led
to
ferocious
arguments
a
young
and
dandiacal
fellow
told
as
a
fact
which
he
was
ready
to
vouch
for
with
a
pistol
how
cora
pearl
the
renowned
english
courtesan
had
through
her
influence
over
a
prefect
of
police
succeeded
in
visiting
a
criminal
alone
in
his
cell
during
the
night
preceding
his
execution
and
had
only
quitted
him
an
hour
before
the
final
summons
the
tale
won
the
honours
of
the
dinner
it
was
regarded
as
truly
impressive
and
inevitably
it
led
to
the
general
inquiry
what
could
the
highest
personages
in
the
empire
see
to
admire
in
that
englishwoman
and
of
course
rivain
himself
the
handsome
homicide
the
centre
and
hero
of
the
fete
was
never
long
out
of
the
conversation
several
of
the
diners
had
seen
him
one
or
two
knew
him
and
could
give
amazing
details
of
his
prowess
as
a
man
of
pleasure
despite
his
crime
he
seemed
to
be
the
object
of
sincere
idolatry
it
was
said
positively
that
a
niece
of
his
victim
had
been
promised
a
front
place
at
the
execution
apropos
of
this
sophia
gathered
to
her
intense
astonishment
and
alarm
that
the
prison
was
close
by
and
that
the
execution
would
take
place
at
the
corner
of
the
square
itself
in
which
the
hotel
was
situated
gerald
must
have
known
he
had
hidden
it
from
her
she
regarded
him
sideways
with
distrust
as
the
dinner
finished
pose
of
a
calm
disinterested
scientific
observer
of
humanity
gradually
broke
down
he
could
not
maintain
it
in
front
of
the
increasing
license
of
the
scene
round
the
table
he
was
at
length
somewhat
ashamed
of
having
exposed
his
wife
to
the
view
of
such
an
orgy
his
restless
glance
carefully
avoided
both
sophia
and
chirac
the
latter
whose
unaffected
simplicity
of
interest
in
the
affair
had
more
than
anything
helped
to
keep
sophia
in
countenance
observed
the
change
in
gerald
and
sophia
excessive
discomfort
and
suggested
that
they
should
leave
the
table
without
waiting
for
the
coffee
gerald
agreed
quickly
thus
had
sophia
been
released
from
the
horror
of
the
dinner
she
did
not
understand
how
a
man
so
thoughtful
and
kindly
as
chirac
he
had
bidden
her
good
night
with
the
most
distinguished
courtesy
could
tolerate
much
less
pleasurably
savour
the
gluttonous
drunken
and
salacious
debauchery
of
the
hotel
de
vezelay
but
his
theory
was
so
far
as
she
could
judge
from
his
imperfect
english
that
whatever
existed
might
be
admitted
and
examined
by
serious
persons
interested
in
the
study
of
human
nature
his
face
seemed
to
say
why
not
his
face
seemed
to
say
to
gerald
and
to
herself
if
this
incommodes
you
what
did
you
come
for
gerald
had
left
her
at
the
bedroom
door
with
a
nod
she
had
partly
undressed
and
lain
down
and
instantly
the
hotel
had
transformed
itself
into
a
kind
of
it
was
as
if
beneath
and
within
all
the
noises
of
the
square
every
movement
in
the
hotel
reached
her
ears
through
cardboard
walls
distant
shoutings
and
laughter
below
rattlings
of
crockery
below
stampings
up
and
down
stairs
stealthy
creepings
up
and
down
stairs
brusque
calls
fragments
of
song
whisperings
long
sighs
suddenly
stifled
mysterious
groans
as
of
torture
broken
by
a
giggle
quarrels
and
bickering
she
was
spared
nothing
in
the
strangely
resonant
darkness
then
there
came
out
of
the
little
square
a
great
uproar
and
commotion
with
shrieks
and
under
the
shrieks
a
confused
din
in
vain
she
pressed
her
face
into
the
pillow
and
listened
to
the
irregular
prodigious
noise
of
her
eyelashes
as
they
scraped
the
rough
linen
the
thought
had
somehow
introduced
itself
into
her
head
that
she
must
arise
and
go
to
the
window
and
see
all
that
was
to
be
seen
she
resisted
she
said
to
herself
that
the
idea
was
absurd
that
she
did
not
wish
to
go
to
the
window
nevertheless
while
arguing
with
herself
she
well
knew
that
resistance
to
the
thought
was
useless
and
that
ultimately
her
legs
would
obey
its
command
when
ultimately
she
yielded
to
the
fascination
and
went
to
the
window
and
pulled
aside
one
of
the
curtains
she
had
a
feeling
of
relief
the
cool
grey
beginnings
of
dawn
were
in
the
sky
and
every
detail
of
the
square
was
visible
without
exception
all
the
windows
were
wide
open
and
filled
with
sightseers
in
the
background
of
many
windows
were
burning
candles
or
lamps
that
the
far
distant
approach
of
the
sun
was
already
killing
in
front
of
these
on
the
frontier
of
two
mingling
lights
the
attentive
figures
of
the
watchers
were
curiously
silhouetted
on
the
roofs
too
was
a
squatted
population
below
a
troop
of
gendarmes
mounted
on
caracoling
horses
stretched
in
line
across
the
square
was
gradually
sweeping
the
entire
square
of
a
packed
gesticulating
cursing
crowd
the
operation
of
this
immense
besom
was
very
slow
as
the
spaces
of
the
square
were
cleared
they
began
to
be
dotted
by
privileged
persons
journalists
or
law
officers
or
their
friends
who
walked
to
and
fro
in
conscious
pride
among
them
sophia
descried
gerald
and
chirac
strolling
and
talking
to
two
elaborately
clad
girls
who
were
also
then
she
saw
a
red
reflection
coming
from
one
of
the
side
streets
of
which
she
had
a
vista
it
was
the
swinging
lantern
of
a
waggon
drawn
by
a
gaunt
grey
horse
the
vehicle
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
square
from
which
the
besom
had
started
and
it
was
immediately
surrounded
by
the
privileged
who
however
were
soon
persuaded
to
stand
away
the
crowd
amassed
now
at
the
principal
inlets
of
the
square
gave
a
formidable
cry
and
burst
into
the
refrain
le
voila
nicolas
ah
ah
ah
the
clamour
became
furious
as
a
group
of
workmen
in
blue
blouses
drew
piece
by
piece
all
the
components
of
the
guillotine
from
the
waggon
and
laid
them
carefully
on
the
ground
under
the
superintendence
of
a
man
in
a
black
and
a
silk
hat
with
broad
flat
brims
a
little
fussy
man
of
nervous
gestures
and
presently
the
red
columns
had
risen
upright
from
the
ground
and
were
joined
at
the
top
by
an
acrobatic
climber
as
each
part
was
bolted
and
screwed
to
the
growing
machine
the
man
in
the
high
hat
carefully
tested
it
in
a
short
time
that
seemed
very
long
the
guillotine
was
finished
save
for
the
triangular
steel
blade
which
lay
shining
on
the
ground
a
cynosure
the
executioner
pointed
to
it
and
two
men
picked
it
up
and
slipped
it
into
its
groove
and
hoisted
it
to
the
summit
of
the
machine
the
executioner
peered
at
it
interminably
amid
a
universal
silence
then
he
actuated
the
mechanism
and
the
mass
of
metal
fell
with
a
muffled
reverberating
thud
there
were
a
few
faint
shrieks
blended
together
and
then
an
overpowering
racket
of
cheers
shouts
hootings
and
fragments
of
song
the
blade
was
again
lifted
instantly
reproducing
silence
and
again
it
fell
liberating
a
new
bedlam
the
executioner
made
a
movement
of
satisfaction
many
women
at
the
windows
clapped
enthusiastically
and
the
gendarmes
had
to
fight
brutally
against
the
fierce
pressure
of
the
crowd
the
workmen
doffed
their
blouses
and
put
on
coats
and
sophia
was
disturbed
to
see
them
coming
in
single
file
towards
the
hotel
followed
by
the
executioner
in
the
silk
hat
iv
there
was
a
tremendous
opening
of
doors
in
the
hotel
de
vezelay
and
much
whispering
on
thresholds
as
the
executioner
and
his
band
entered
solemnly
sophia
heard
them
tramp
upstairs
they
seemed
to
hesitate
and
then
apparently
went
into
a
room
on
the
same
landing
as
hers
a
door
banged
but
sophia
could
hear
the
regular
sound
of
new
voices
talking
and
then
the
rattling
of
glasses
on
a
tray
the
conversation
which
came
to
her
from
the
windows
of
the
hotel
now
showed
a
great
increase
of
excitement
she
could
not
see
the
people
at
these
neighbouring
windows
without
showing
her
own
head
and
this
she
would
not
do
the
boom
of
a
heavy
bell
striking
the
hour
vibrated
over
the
roofs
of
the
square
she
supposed
that
it
might
be
the
cathedral
clock
in
a
corner
of
the
square
she
saw
gerald
talking
vivaciously
alone
with
one
of
the
two
girls
who
had
been
together
she
wondered
vaguely
how
such
a
girl
had
been
brought
up
and
what
her
parents
thought
or
knew
and
she
was
conscious
of
an
intense
pride
in
herself
of
a
measureless
haughty
feeling
of
superiority
her
eye
caught
the
guillotine
again
and
was
held
by
it
guarded
by
gendarmes
that
tall
and
simple
object
did
most
menacingly
dominate
the
square
with
its
crude
red
columns
tools
and
a
large
open
box
lay
on
the
ground
beside
it
the
enfeebled
horse
in
the
waggon
had
an
air
of
dozing
on
his
twisted
legs
then
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
shot
lengthwise
across
the
square
at
the
level
of
the
chimneys
and
sophia
noticed
that
nearly
all
the
lamps
and
candles
had
been
extinguished
many
people
at
the
windows
were
yawning
they
laughed
foolishly
after
they
had
yawned
some
were
eating
and
drinking
some
were
shouting
conversations
from
one
house
to
another
the
mounted
gendarmes
were
still
pressing
back
the
feverish
crowds
that
growled
at
all
the
inlets
to
the
square
she
saw
chirac
walking
to
and
fro
alone
but
she
could
not
find
gerald
he
could
not
have
left
the
square
perhaps
he
had
returned
to
the
hotel
and
would
come
up
to
see
if
she
was
comfortable
or
if
she
needed
anything
guiltily
she
sprang
back
into
bed
when
last
she
had
surveyed
the
room
it
had
been
dark
now
it
was
bright
and
every
detail
stood
clear
yet
she
had
the
sensation
of
having
been
at
the
window
only
a
few
minutes
she
waited
but
gerald
did
not
come
she
could
hear
chiefly
the
steady
hum
of
the
voices
of
the
executioner
and
his
aids
she
reflected
that
the
room
in
which
they
were
must
be
at
the
back
the
other
sounds
in
the
hotel
grew
less
noticeable
then
after
an
age
she
heard
a
door
open
and
a
low
voice
say
something
commandingly
in
french
and
then
a
monsieur
and
a
general
descent
of
the
stairs
the
executioner
and
his
aids
were
leaving
you
cried
a
drunken
english
voice
from
an
upper
floor
it
was
the
englishman
translating
what
the
executioner
had
said
you
you
will
take
the
head
then
a
rough
laugh
and
the
repeating
voice
of
the
englishman
girl
still
pursuing
her
studies
in
english
you
will
take
ze
yess
sair
and
another
laugh
at
length
quiet
reigned
in
the
hotel
sophia
said
to
herself
i
wo
stir
from
this
bed
till
it
all
over
and
gerald
comes
back
she
dozed
under
the
sheet
and
was
awakened
by
a
tremendous
shrieking
growling
and
yelling
a
phenomenon
of
human
bestiality
that
far
surpassed
sophia
narrow
experiences
shut
up
though
she
was
in
a
room
perfectly
secure
the
mad
fury
of
that
crowd
balked
at
the
inlets
to
the
square
thrilled
and
intimidated
her
it
sounded
as
if
they
would
be
capable
of
tearing
the
very
horses
to
pieces
i
must
stay
where
i
am
she
murmured
and
even
while
saying
it
she
rose
and
went
to
the
window
again
and
peeped
out
the
torture
involved
was
extreme
but
she
had
not
sufficient
force
within
her
to
resist
the
fascination
she
stared
greedily
into
the
bright
square
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
gerald
coming
out
of
a
house
opposite
followed
after
a
few
seconds
by
the
girl
with
whom
he
had
previously
been
talking
gerald
glanced
hastily
up
at
the
facade
of
the
hotel
and
then
approached
as
near
as
he
could
to
the
red
columns
in
front
of
which
were
now
drawn
a
line
of
gendarmes
with
naked
swords
a
second
and
larger
waggon
with
two
horses
waited
by
the
side
of
the
other
one
the
racket
beyond
the
square
continued
and
even
grew
louder
but
the
couple
of
hundred
persons
within
the
cordons
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
windows
drunk
and
sober
gazed
in
a
fixed
and
sinister
enchantment
at
the
region
of
the
guillotine
as
sophia
gazed
i
can
not
stand
this
she
told
herself
in
horror
but
she
could
not
move
she
could
not
move
even
her
eyes
at
intervals
the
crowd
would
burst
out
in
a
violent
staccato
le
voila
nicholas
ah
ah
ah
and
the
final
was
devilish
then
a
gigantic
passionate
roar
the
culmination
of
the
mob
fierce
savagery
crashed
against
the
skies
the
line
of
maddened
horses
swerved
and
reared
and
seemed
to
fall
on
the
furious
multitude
while
the
gendarmes
rocked
over
them
it
was
a
last
effort
to
break
the
cordon
and
it
failed
from
the
little
street
at
the
rear
of
the
guillotine
appeared
a
priest
walking
backwards
and
holding
a
crucifix
high
in
his
right
hand
and
behind
him
came
the
handsome
hero
his
body
all
crossed
with
cords
between
two
warders
who
pressed
against
him
and
supported
him
on
either
side
he
was
certainly
very
young
he
lifted
his
chin
gallantly
but
his
face
was
incredibly
white
sophia
discerned
that
the
priest
was
trying
to
hide
the
sight
of
the
guillotine
from
the
prisoner
with
his
body
just
as
in
the
story
which
she
had
heard
at
dinner
except
the
voice
of
the
priest
indistinctly
rising
and
falling
in
the
prayer
for
the
dying
there
was
no
sound
in
the
square
or
its
environs
the
windows
were
now
occupied
by
groups
turned
to
stone
with
distended
eyes
fixed
on
the
little
procession
sophia
had
a
tightening
of
the
throat
and
the
hand
trembled
by
which
she
held
the
curtain
the
central
figure
did
not
seem
to
her
to
be
alive
but
rather
a
doll
a
marionette
wound
up
to
imitate
the
action
of
a
tragedy
she
saw
the
priest
offer
the
crucifix
to
the
mouth
of
the
marionette
which
with
a
clumsy
unhuman
shoving
of
its
corded
shoulders
butted
the
thing
away
and
as
the
procession
turned
and
stopped
she
could
plainly
see
that
the
marionette
nape
and
shoulders
were
bare
his
shirt
having
been
slit
it
was
horrible
why
do
i
stay
here
she
asked
herself
hysterically
but
she
did
not
stir
the
victim
had
disappeared
now
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
men
then
she
perceived
him
prone
under
the
red
column
between
the
grooves
the
silence
was
now
broken
only
by
the
tinkling
of
the
horses
bits
in
the
corners
of
the
square
the
line
of
gendarmes
in
front
of
the
scaffold
held
their
swords
tightly
and
looked
over
their
noses
ignoring
the
privileged
groups
that
peered
almost
between
their
shoulders
and
sophia
waited
she
saw
nothing
but
the
gleaming
triangle
of
metal
that
was
suspended
high
above
the
prone
attendant
victim
she
felt
like
a
lost
soul
torn
too
soon
from
shelter
and
exposed
for
ever
to
the
worst
hazards
of
destiny
why
was
she
in
this
strange
incomprehensible
town
foreign
and
inimical
to
her
watching
with
agonized
glance
this
cruel
obscene
spectacle
her
sensibilities
were
all
a
bleeding
mass
of
wounds
why
only
yesterday
and
she
had
been
an
innocent
timid
creature
in
bursley
in
axe
a
foolish
creature
who
deemed
the
concealment
of
letters
a
supreme
excitement
either
that
day
or
this
day
was
not
real
why
was
she
imprisoned
alone
in
that
odious
indescribably
odious
hotel
with
no
one
to
soothe
and
comfort
her
and
carry
her
away
the
distant
bell
boomed
once
then
a
monosyllabic
voice
sounded
sharp
low
nervous
she
recognized
the
voice
of
the
executioner
whose
name
she
had
heard
but
could
not
remember
there
was
a
clicking
noise
she
shrank
down
to
the
floor
in
terror
and
loathing
and
hid
her
face
and
shuddered
shriek
after
shriek
from
various
windows
rang
on
her
ears
in
a
fusillade
and
then
the
mad
yell
of
the
penned
crowd
which
like
herself
had
not
seen
but
had
heard
extinguished
all
other
noise
justice
was
done
the
great
ambition
of
gerald
life
was
at
last
satisfied
later
amid
the
stir
of
the
hotel
there
came
a
knock
at
her
door
impatient
and
nervous
forgetting
in
her
tribulation
that
she
was
without
her
bodice
she
got
up
from
the
floor
in
a
kind
of
miserable
dream
and
opened
chirac
stood
on
the
landing
and
he
had
gerald
by
the
arm
chirac
looked
worn
out
curiously
fragile
and
pathetic
but
gerald
was
the
very
image
of
death
the
attainment
of
ambition
had
utterly
destroyed
his
equilibrium
his
curiosity
had
proved
itself
stronger
than
his
stomach
sophia
would
have
pitied
him
had
she
in
that
moment
been
capable
of
pity
gerald
staggered
past
her
into
the
room
and
sank
with
a
groan
on
to
the
bed
not
long
since
he
had
been
proudly
conversing
with
impudent
women
now
in
swift
collapse
he
was
as
flaccid
as
a
sick
hound
and
as
disgusting
as
an
aged
drunkard
he
is
some
little
souffrant
said
chirac
weakly
sophia
perceived
in
chirac
tone
the
assumption
that
of
course
her
present
duty
was
to
devote
herself
to
the
task
of
restoring
her
shamed
husband
to
his
manly
pride
and
what
about
me
she
thought
bitterly
the
fat
woman
ascended
the
stairs
like
a
tottering
blancmange
and
began
to
gabble
to
sophia
who
understood
nothing
whatever
she
wants
sixty
francs
chirac
said
and
in
answer
to
startled
question
he
explained
that
gerald
had
agreed
to
pay
a
hundred
francs
for
the
room
which
was
the
landlady
own
fifty
francs
in
advance
and
the
fifty
after
the
execution
the
other
ten
was
for
the
dinner
the
landlady
distrusting
the
whole
of
her
clientele
was
collecting
her
accounts
instantly
on
the
completion
of
the
spectacle
sophia
made
no
remark
as
to
gerald
lie
to
her
indeed
chirac
had
heard
it
she
knew
gerald
for
a
glib
liar
to
others
but
she
was
naively
surprised
when
he
practised
upon
herself
gerald
do
you
hear
she
said
coldly
the
amateur
of
severed
heads
only
groaned
with
a
movement
of
irritation
she
went
to
him
and
felt
in
his
pockets
for
his
purse
he
acquiesced
still
groaning
chirac
helped
her
to
choose
and
count
the
coins
the
fat
woman
appeased
pursued
her
way
madame
said
chirac
with
his
customary
courtliness
transforming
the
landing
of
the
hideous
hotel
into
some
imperial
antechamber
are
you
going
away
she
asked
in
surprise
her
distress
was
so
obvious
that
it
tremendously
flattered
him
he
would
have
stayed
if
he
could
but
he
had
to
return
to
paris
to
write
and
deliver
his
article
i
hope
he
murmured
sympathetically
kissing
her
hand
the
gesture
atoned
somewhat
for
the
sordidness
of
her
situation
and
even
corrected
the
faults
of
her
attire
always
afterwards
it
seemed
to
her
that
chirac
was
an
old
and
intimate
friend
he
had
successfully
passed
through
the
ordeal
of
seeing
wrong
side
of
the
stuff
of
her
life
she
shut
the
door
on
him
with
a
lingering
glance
and
reconciled
herself
to
her
predicament
gerald
slept
just
as
he
was
he
slept
heavily
this
was
what
he
had
brought
her
to
then
the
horrors
of
the
night
of
the
dawn
and
of
the
morning
ineffable
suffering
and
humiliation
anguish
and
torture
that
could
never
be
forgotten
and
after
a
fatuous
vigil
of
unguessed
license
he
had
tottered
back
an
offensive
beast
to
sleep
the
day
away
in
that
filthy
chamber
he
did
not
possess
even
enough
spirit
to
play
the
role
of
roysterer
to
the
end
and
she
was
bound
to
him
far
far
from
any
other
human
aid
cut
off
irrevocably
by
her
pride
from
those
who
perhaps
would
have
protected
her
from
his
dangerous
folly
the
deep
conviction
henceforward
formed
a
permanent
part
of
her
general
consciousness
that
he
was
simply
an
irresponsible
and
thoughtless
fool
he
was
without
sense
such
was
her
brilliant
and
godlike
husband
the
man
who
had
given
her
the
right
to
call
herself
a
married
woman
he
was
a
fool
with
all
her
ignorance
of
the
world
she
could
see
that
nobody
but
an
arrant
imbecile
could
have
brought
her
to
the
present
pass
her
native
sagacity
revolted
gusts
of
feeling
came
over
her
in
which
she
could
have
thrashed
him
into
the
realization
of
his
responsibilities
sticking
out
of
the
of
his
soiled
coat
was
the
packet
which
he
had
received
on
the
previous
day
if
he
had
not
already
lost
it
he
could
only
thank
his
luck
she
took
it
there
were
english
in
it
for
two
hundred
pounds
a
letter
from
a
banker
and
other
papers
with
precautions
against
noise
she
tore
the
envelope
and
the
letter
and
papers
into
small
pieces
and
then
looked
about
for
a
place
to
hide
them
a
cupboard
suggested
itself
she
got
on
a
chair
and
pushed
the
fragments
out
of
sight
on
the
topmost
shelf
where
they
may
well
be
to
this
day
she
finished
dressing
and
then
sewed
the
notes
into
the
lining
of
her
skirt
she
had
no
silly
delicate
notions
about
stealing
she
obscurely
felt
that
in
the
care
of
a
man
like
gerald
she
might
find
herself
in
the
most
monstrous
the
most
impossible
dilemmas
those
notes
safe
and
secret
in
her
skirt
gave
her
confidence
reassured
her
against
the
perils
of
the
future
and
endowed
her
with
independence
the
act
was
characteristic
of
her
enterprise
and
of
her
fundamental
prudence
it
approached
the
heroic
and
her
conscience
hotly
defended
its
righteousness
she
decided
that
when
he
discovered
his
loss
she
would
merely
deny
all
knowledge
of
the
envelope
for
he
had
not
spoken
a
word
to
her
about
it
he
never
mentioned
the
details
of
money
he
had
a
fortune
however
the
necessity
for
this
untruth
did
not
occur
he
made
no
reference
whatever
to
his
loss
the
fact
was
he
thought
he
had
been
careless
enough
to
let
the
envelope
be
filched
from
him
during
the
excesses
of
the
night
all
day
till
evening
sophia
sat
on
a
dirty
chair
without
food
while
gerald
slept
she
kept
repeating
to
herself
in
amazed
resentment
a
hundred
francs
for
this
room
a
hundred
francs
and
he
had
the
pluck
to
tell
me
she
could
not
have
expressed
her
contempt
long
before
sheer
ennui
forced
her
to
look
out
of
the
window
again
every
sign
of
justice
had
been
removed
from
the
square
nothing
whatever
remained
in
the
heavy
august
sunshine
save
gathered
heaps
of
filth
where
the
horses
had
reared
and
caracoled
chapter
iv
a
crisis
for
gerald
i
for
a
time
there
existed
in
the
minds
of
both
gerald
and
sophia
the
remarkable
notion
that
twelve
thousand
pounds
represented
the
infinity
of
wealth
that
this
sum
possessed
special
magical
properties
which
rendered
it
insensible
to
the
process
of
subtraction
it
seemed
impossible
that
twelve
thousand
pounds
while
continually
getting
less
could
ultimately
quite
disappear
the
notion
lived
longer
in
the
mind
of
gerald
than
in
that
of
sophia
for
gerald
would
never
look
at
a
disturbing
fact
whereas
sophia
gaze
was
morbidly
fascinated
by
such
phenomena
in
a
life
devoted
to
travel
and
pleasure
gerald
meant
not
to
spend
more
than
six
hundred
a
year
the
interest
on
his
fortune
six
hundred
a
year
is
less
than
two
pounds
a
day
yet
gerald
never
paid
less
than
two
pounds
a
day
in
hotel
bills
alone
he
hoped
that
he
was
living
on
a
thousand
a
year
had
a
secret
fear
that
he
might
be
spending
fifteen
hundred
and
was
really
spending
about
two
thousand
five
hundred
still
the
remarkable
notion
of
the
inexhaustibility
of
twelve
thousand
pounds
always
reassured
him
the
faster
the
money
went
the
more
vigorously
this
notion
flourished
in
gerald
mind
when
twelve
had
unaccountably
dwindled
to
three
gerald
suddenly
decided
that
he
must
act
and
in
a
few
months
he
lost
two
thousand
on
the
paris
bourse
the
adventure
frightened
him
and
in
his
panic
he
scattered
a
couple
of
hundred
in
a
frenzy
of
high
living
but
even
with
only
twenty
thousand
francs
left
out
of
three
hundred
thousand
he
held
closely
to
the
belief
that
natural
laws
would
in
his
case
somehow
be
suspended
he
had
heard
of
men
who
were
once
rich
begging
bread
and
sweeping
crossings
but
he
felt
quite
secure
against
such
risks
by
simple
virtue
of
the
axiom
that
he
was
he
however
he
meant
to
assist
the
axiom
by
efforts
to
earn
money
when
these
continued
to
fail
he
tried
to
assist
the
axiom
by
borrowing
money
but
he
found
that
his
uncle
had
definitely
done
with
him
he
would
have
assisted
the
axiom
by
stealing
money
but
he
had
neither
the
nerve
nor
the
knowledge
to
be
a
swindler
he
was
not
even
sufficiently
expert
to
cheat
at
cards
he
had
thought
in
thousands
now
he
began
to
think
in
hundreds
in
tens
daily
and
hourly
he
paid
two
hundred
francs
in
railway
fares
in
order
to
live
economically
in
a
village
and
shortly
afterwards
another
two
hundred
francs
in
railway
fares
in
order
to
live
economically
in
paris
and
to
celebrate
the
arrival
in
paris
and
the
definite
commencement
of
an
era
of
strict
economy
and
serious
search
for
a
livelihood
he
spent
a
hundred
francs
on
a
dinner
at
the
maison
doree
and
two
balcony
stalls
at
the
gymnase
in
brief
he
omitted
nothing
no
act
no
resolve
no
of
the
typical
fool
in
his
situation
always
convinced
that
his
difficulties
and
his
wisdom
were
quite
exceptional
in
may
on
an
afternoon
he
was
ranging
nervously
to
and
fro
in
a
bedroom
of
a
little
hotel
at
the
angle
of
the
rue
fontaine
and
the
rue
laval
now
the
rue
victor
masse
within
half
a
minute
of
the
boulevard
de
clichy
it
had
come
to
that
an
exchange
of
the
boulevard
for
the
exterieur
sophia
sat
on
a
chair
at
the
grimy
window
glancing
down
in
idle
disgust
of
life
at
the
omnibus
which
was
casting
off
its
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
chaptal
the
noise
of
petty
hurried
traffic
over
the
bossy
paving
stones
was
deafening
the
locality
was
not
one
to
correspond
with
an
ideal
there
was
too
much
humanity
crowded
into
those
narrow
hilly
streets
humanity
seemed
to
be
bulging
out
at
the
windows
of
the
high
houses
gerald
healed
his
pride
by
saying
that
this
was
after
all
the
real
paris
and
that
the
cookery
was
as
good
as
could
be
got
anywhere
pay
what
you
would
he
seldom
ate
a
meal
in
the
little
salons
on
the
first
floor
without
becoming
ecstatic
upon
the
cookery
to
hear
him
he
might
have
chosen
the
hotel
on
its
superlative
merits
without
regard
to
expense
and
with
his
air
of
use
and
custom
he
did
indeed
look
like
a
connoisseur
of
paris
who
knew
better
than
to
herd
with
vulgar
tourists
in
the
pens
of
the
madeleine
quarter
he
was
dressed
with
some
distinction
good
clothes
when
put
to
the
test
survive
a
change
of
fortune
as
a
roman
arch
survives
the
luxury
of
departed
empire
only
his
collar
large
front
and
wristbands
which
bore
the
ineffaceable
signs
of
cheap
laundering
reflected
the
shadow
of
impending
disaster
he
glanced
sideways
stealthily
at
sophia
she
too
was
still
dressed
with
distinction
in
the
robe
of
black
faille
the
cashmere
shawl
and
the
little
black
hat
with
its
falling
veil
there
was
no
apparent
symptom
of
beggary
she
would
have
been
judged
as
one
of
those
women
who
content
themselves
with
few
clothes
but
good
and
greatly
aided
by
nature
make
a
little
go
a
long
way
good
black
will
last
for
eternity
it
discloses
no
secrets
of
modification
and
mending
and
it
is
not
transparent
at
last
gerald
resuming
a
suspended
conversation
said
as
it
were
doggedly
i
tell
you
i
have
got
five
francs
altogether
and
you
can
feel
my
pockets
if
you
like
added
the
habitual
liar
in
him
fearing
incredulity
well
and
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
sophia
inquired
the
accent
at
once
ironic
and
listless
in
which
she
put
this
question
showed
that
strange
and
vital
things
had
happened
to
sophia
in
the
four
years
which
had
elapsed
since
her
marriage
it
did
really
seem
to
her
indeed
that
the
sophia
whom
gerald
had
espoused
was
dead
and
gone
and
that
another
sophia
had
come
into
her
body
so
intensely
conscious
was
she
of
a
fundamental
change
in
herself
under
the
stress
of
continuous
experience
and
though
this
was
but
a
seeming
though
she
was
still
the
same
sophia
more
fully
disclosed
it
was
a
true
seeming
indisputably
more
beautiful
than
when
gerald
had
unwillingly
made
her
his
legal
wife
she
was
now
nearly
and
looked
perhaps
somewhat
older
than
her
age
her
frame
was
firmly
set
her
waist
thicker
neither
slim
nor
stout
the
lips
were
rather
hard
and
she
had
a
habit
of
tightening
her
mouth
on
the
same
provocation
as
sends
a
snail
into
its
shell
no
trace
was
left
of
immature
gawkiness
in
her
gestures
or
of
simplicity
in
her
intonations
she
was
a
woman
of
commanding
and
slightly
arrogant
charm
not
in
the
least
degree
the
charm
of
innocence
and
ingenuousness
her
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
one
who
has
lost
her
illusions
too
violently
and
too
completely
her
gaze
coldly
comprehending
implied
familiarity
with
the
abjectness
of
human
nature
gerald
had
begun
and
had
finished
her
education
he
had
not
ruined
her
as
a
bad
professor
may
ruin
a
fine
voice
because
her
moral
force
immeasurably
exceeded
his
he
had
unwittingly
produced
a
masterpiece
but
it
was
a
tragic
masterpiece
sophia
was
such
a
woman
as
by
a
mere
glance
as
she
utters
an
opinion
will
make
a
man
say
to
himself
half
in
desire
and
half
in
alarm
lest
she
reads
him
too
by
jove
she
must
have
been
through
a
thing
or
two
she
knows
what
people
are
the
marriage
was
of
course
a
calamitous
folly
from
the
very
first
from
the
moment
when
the
commercial
traveller
had
with
incomparable
rash
fatuity
thrown
the
paper
pellet
over
the
counter
awakening
commonsense
had
told
her
that
in
yielding
to
her
instinct
she
was
sowing
misery
and
shame
for
herself
but
she
had
gone
on
as
if
under
a
spell
it
had
needed
the
irretrievableness
of
flight
from
home
to
begin
the
breaking
of
the
trance
once
fully
awakened
out
of
the
trance
she
had
recognized
her
marriage
for
what
it
was
she
had
made
neither
the
best
nor
the
worst
of
it
she
had
accepted
gerald
as
one
accepts
a
climate
she
saw
again
and
again
that
he
was
irreclaimably
a
fool
and
a
prodigy
of
irresponsibleness
she
tolerated
him
now
with
sweetness
now
bitterly
accepting
always
his
caprices
and
not
permitting
herself
to
have
wishes
of
her
own
she
was
ready
to
pay
the
price
of
pride
and
of
a
moment
imbecility
with
a
lifetime
of
it
was
high
but
it
was
the
price
she
had
acquired
nothing
but
an
exceptionally
good
knowledge
of
the
french
language
she
soon
learnt
to
scorn
gerald
glib
maltreatment
of
the
tongue
and
she
had
conserved
nothing
but
her
dignity
she
knew
that
gerald
was
sick
of
her
that
he
would
have
danced
for
joy
to
be
rid
of
her
that
he
was
constantly
unfaithful
that
he
had
long
since
ceased
to
be
excited
by
her
beauty
she
knew
also
that
at
bottom
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
her
here
was
her
sole
moral
consolation
the
thing
that
sometimes
struck
her
as
surprising
was
that
he
had
not
abandoned
her
simply
and
crudely
walked
off
one
day
and
forgotten
to
take
her
with
him
they
hated
each
other
but
in
different
ways
she
loathed
him
and
he
resented
her
what
do
i
expect
you
to
do
he
repeated
after
her
why
do
you
write
home
to
your
people
and
get
some
money
out
of
them
now
that
he
had
said
what
was
in
his
mind
he
faced
her
with
a
bullying
swagger
had
he
been
a
bigger
man
he
might
have
tried
the
effect
of
physical
bullying
on
her
one
of
his
numerous
reasons
for
resenting
her
was
that
she
was
the
taller
of
the
two
she
made
no
reply
now
you
need
turn
pale
and
begin
all
that
fuss
over
again
what
suggesting
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
thing
if
i
have
got
money
i
have
got
it
i
ca
invent
it
she
perceived
that
he
was
ready
for
one
of
their
periodical
tempestuous
quarrels
but
that
day
she
felt
too
tired
and
unwell
to
quarrel
his
warning
against
a
repetition
of
had
reference
to
the
gastric
dizziness
from
which
she
had
been
suffering
for
two
years
it
would
take
her
usually
after
a
meal
she
did
not
swoon
but
her
head
swam
and
she
could
not
stand
she
would
sink
down
wherever
she
happened
to
be
and
her
face
alarmingly
white
murmur
faintly
my
salts
within
five
minutes
the
attack
had
gone
and
left
no
trace
she
had
been
through
one
just
after
lunch
he
resented
this
affection
he
detested
being
compelled
to
hand
the
to
her
and
he
would
have
avoided
doing
so
if
her
pallor
did
not
always
alarm
him
nothing
but
this
pallor
convinced
him
that
the
attacks
were
not
a
deep
ruse
to
impress
him
his
attitude
invariably
implied
that
she
could
cure
the
malady
if
she
chose
but
that
through
obstinacy
she
did
not
choose
are
you
going
to
have
the
decency
to
answer
my
question
or
you
what
question
her
vibrating
voice
was
low
and
restrained
will
you
write
to
your
people
for
money
the
sarcasm
of
her
tone
was
diabolic
she
could
not
have
kept
the
sarcasm
out
of
her
tone
she
did
not
attempt
to
keep
it
out
she
cared
little
if
it
whipped
him
to
fury
did
he
imagine
seriously
that
she
would
be
capable
of
going
on
her
knees
to
her
family
she
was
he
unaware
that
his
wife
was
the
proudest
and
the
most
obstinate
woman
on
earth
that
all
her
behaviour
to
him
was
the
expression
of
her
pride
and
her
obstinacy
ill
and
weak
though
she
felt
she
marshalled
together
all
the
forces
of
her
character
to
defend
her
resolve
never
never
to
eat
the
bread
of
humiliation
she
was
absolutely
determined
to
be
dead
to
her
family
certainly
one
december
several
years
previously
she
had
seen
english
christmas
cards
in
an
english
shop
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
in
a
sudden
gush
of
tenderness
towards
constance
she
had
despatched
a
coloured
greeting
to
constance
and
her
mother
and
having
initiated
the
custom
she
had
continued
it
that
was
not
like
asking
a
kindness
it
was
bestowing
a
kindness
but
except
for
the
annual
card
she
was
dead
to
luke
square
she
was
one
of
those
daughters
who
disappear
and
are
not
discussed
in
the
family
circle
the
thought
of
her
immense
foolishness
the
little
tender
thoughts
of
constance
some
flitting
souvenir
full
of
unwilling
admiration
of
a
regal
gesture
of
her
mother
these
things
only
steeled
her
against
any
sort
of
resurrection
after
death
and
he
was
urging
her
to
write
home
for
money
why
she
would
not
even
have
paid
a
visit
in
splendour
to
luke
square
never
should
they
know
what
she
had
suffered
and
especially
her
aunt
harriet
from
whom
she
had
stolen
will
you
write
to
your
people
he
demanded
yet
again
emphasizing
and
separating
each
word
no
she
said
shortly
with
terrible
disdain
why
not
because
i
wo
the
curling
line
of
her
lips
as
they
closed
on
each
other
said
all
the
rest
all
the
cruel
truths
about
his
unspeakable
inane
coarse
follies
his
laziness
his
excesses
his
lies
his
deceptions
his
bad
faith
his
truculence
his
improvidence
his
shameful
waste
and
ruin
of
his
life
and
hers
she
doubted
whether
he
realized
his
baseness
and
her
wrongs
but
if
he
could
not
read
them
in
her
silent
contumely
she
was
too
proud
to
recite
them
to
him
she
had
never
complained
save
in
uncontrolled
moments
of
anger
if
that
the
way
you
going
to
talk
all
right
he
snapped
furious
evidently
he
was
baffled
she
kept
silence
she
was
determined
to
see
what
he
would
do
in
the
face
of
her
inaction
you
know
i
not
joking
he
pursued
we
shall
starve
very
well
she
agreed
we
shall
starve
she
watched
him
surreptitiously
and
she
was
almost
sure
that
he
really
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
tether
his
voice
which
never
alone
convinced
carried
a
sort
of
conviction
now
he
was
penniless
in
four
years
he
had
squandered
twelve
thousand
pounds
and
had
nothing
to
show
for
it
except
an
enfeebled
digestion
and
a
tragic
figure
of
a
wife
one
small
point
of
satisfaction
there
was
and
all
the
baines
in
her
clutched
at
it
and
tried
to
suck
satisfaction
from
it
their
manner
of
travelling
about
from
hotel
to
hotel
had
made
it
impossible
for
gerald
to
run
up
debts
a
few
debts
he
might
have
unknown
to
her
but
they
could
not
be
serious
so
they
looked
at
one
another
in
hatred
and
despair
the
inevitable
had
arrived
for
months
she
had
fronted
it
in
bravado
not
concealing
from
herself
that
it
lay
in
waiting
for
years
he
had
been
sure
that
though
the
inevitable
might
happen
to
others
it
could
not
happen
to
him
there
it
was
he
was
conscious
of
a
heavy
weight
in
his
stomach
and
she
of
a
general
numbness
enwrapping
her
fatigue
even
then
he
could
not
believe
that
it
was
true
this
disaster
as
for
sophia
she
was
reconciling
herself
with
bitter
philosophy
to
the
eccentricities
of
fate
who
would
have
dreamed
that
she
a
young
girl
brought
up
etc
her
mother
could
not
have
improved
the
occasion
more
uncompromisingly
than
sophia
did
behind
that
disdainful
mask
well
if
that
it
gerald
exploded
at
length
puffing
and
he
puffed
out
of
the
room
and
was
gone
in
a
second
ii
she
languidly
picked
up
a
book
the
moment
gerald
had
departed
and
tried
to
prove
to
herself
that
she
was
sufficiently
in
command
of
her
nerves
to
read
for
a
long
time
reading
had
been
her
chief
solace
but
she
could
not
read
she
glanced
round
the
inhospitable
chamber
and
thought
of
the
hundreds
of
rooms
some
splendid
and
some
vile
but
all
arid
in
their
unwelcoming
aspect
through
which
she
had
passed
in
her
progress
from
mad
exultation
to
calm
and
cold
disgust
the
ceaseless
din
of
the
street
annoyed
her
jaded
ears
and
a
great
wave
of
desire
for
peace
peace
of
no
matter
what
kind
swept
through
her
and
then
her
deep
distrust
of
gerald
reawakened
in
spite
of
his
seriously
desperate
air
which
had
a
quality
of
sincerity
quite
new
in
her
experience
of
him
she
could
not
be
entirely
sure
that
in
asserting
utter
penury
he
was
not
after
all
merely
using
a
trick
to
get
rid
of
her
she
sprang
up
threw
the
book
on
the
bed
and
seized
her
gloves
she
would
follow
him
if
she
could
she
would
do
what
she
had
never
done
before
she
would
spy
on
him
fighting
against
her
lassitude
she
descended
the
long
winding
stairs
and
peeped
forth
from
the
doorway
into
the
street
the
ground
floor
of
the
hotel
was
a
the
stout
landlord
was
lightly
flicking
one
of
the
three
little
yellow
tables
that
stood
on
the
pavement
he
smiled
with
his
customary
benevolence
and
silently
pointed
in
the
direction
of
the
rue
notre
dame
de
lorette
she
saw
gerald
down
there
in
the
distance
he
was
smoking
a
cigar
he
seemed
to
be
a
little
man
without
a
care
the
smoke
of
the
cigar
came
first
round
his
left
cheek
and
then
round
his
right
sailing
away
into
nothing
he
walked
with
a
gay
spring
but
not
quickly
flourishing
his
cane
as
freely
as
the
traffic
of
the
pavement
would
permit
glancing
into
all
the
shop
windows
and
into
the
eyes
of
all
the
women
under
forty
this
was
not
at
all
the
same
man
as
had
a
moment
ago
been
spitting
angry
menaces
at
her
in
the
bedroom
of
the
hotel
it
was
a
fellow
of
blithe
charm
ripe
for
any
adventurous
joys
that
destiny
had
to
offer
supposing
he
turned
round
and
saw
her
if
he
turned
round
and
saw
her
and
asked
her
what
she
was
doing
there
in
the
street
she
would
tell
him
plainly
i
following
you
to
find
out
what
you
do
but
he
did
not
turn
he
went
straight
forward
deviating
at
the
church
where
the
crowd
became
thicker
into
the
rue
du
faubourg
montmartre
and
so
to
the
boulevard
which
he
crossed
the
whole
city
seemed
excited
and
vivacious
cannons
boomed
in
slow
succession
and
flags
were
flying
sophia
had
no
conception
of
the
significance
of
those
guns
for
though
she
read
a
great
deal
she
never
read
a
newspaper
the
idea
of
opening
a
newspaper
never
occurred
to
her
but
she
was
accustomed
to
the
feverish
atmosphere
of
paris
she
had
lately
seen
regiments
of
cavalry
flashing
and
prancing
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
and
had
much
admired
the
fine
picture
she
accepted
the
booming
as
another
expression
of
the
high
spirits
that
had
to
find
vent
somehow
in
this
feverish
empire
she
so
accepted
it
and
forgot
it
using
all
the
panorama
of
the
capital
as
a
dim
background
for
her
exacerbated
egoism
she
was
obliged
to
walk
slowly
because
gerald
walked
slowly
a
beautiful
woman
or
any
woman
not
positively
or
venerable
who
walks
slowly
in
the
streets
of
paris
becomes
at
once
the
cause
of
inconvenient
desires
as
representing
the
main
objective
on
earth
always
transcending
in
importance
politics
and
affairs
just
as
a
true
patriotic
englishman
can
not
be
too
busy
to
run
after
a
fox
so
a
frenchman
is
always
ready
to
forsake
all
in
order
to
follow
a
woman
whom
he
has
never
before
set
eyes
on
many
men
thought
twice
about
her
with
her
romantic
saxon
mystery
of
temperament
and
her
parisian
clothes
but
all
refrained
from
affronting
her
not
in
the
least
out
of
respect
for
the
gloom
in
her
face
but
from
an
expert
conviction
that
those
rapt
eyes
were
fixed
immovably
on
another
male
she
walked
unscathed
amid
the
frothing
hounds
as
though
protected
by
a
spell
on
the
south
side
of
the
boulevard
gerald
proceeded
down
the
rue
montmartre
and
then
turned
suddenly
into
the
rue
croissant
sophia
stopped
and
asked
the
price
of
some
combs
which
were
exposed
outside
a
little
shop
then
she
went
on
boldly
passing
the
end
of
the
rue
croissant
no
shadow
of
gerald
she
saw
the
signs
of
newspapers
all
along
the
street
le
bien
public
la
presse
libre
la
patrie
there
was
a
creamery
at
the
corner
she
entered
it
asked
for
a
cup
of
chocolate
and
sat
down
she
wanted
to
drink
coffee
but
every
doctor
had
forbidden
coffee
to
her
on
account
of
her
attacks
of
dizziness
then
having
ordered
chocolate
she
felt
that
on
this
occasion
when
she
had
need
of
strength
in
her
great
fatigue
only
coffee
could
suffice
her
and
she
changed
the
order
she
was
close
to
the
door
and
gerald
could
not
escape
her
vigilance
if
he
emerged
at
that
end
of
the
street
she
drank
the
coffee
with
greedy
satisfaction
and
waited
in
the
creamery
till
she
began
to
feel
conspicuous
there
and
then
gerald
went
by
the
door
within
six
feet
of
her
he
turned
the
corner
and
continued
his
descent
of
the
rue
montmartre
she
paid
for
her
coffee
and
followed
the
chase
her
blood
seemed
to
be
up
her
lips
were
tightened
and
her
thought
was
wherever
he
goes
i
go
and
i
do
care
what
happens
she
despised
him
she
felt
herself
above
him
she
felt
that
somehow
since
quitting
the
hotel
he
had
been
gradually
growing
more
and
more
vile
and
meet
to
be
exterminated
she
imagined
infamies
as
to
the
rue
croissant
there
was
no
obvious
ground
for
this
intensifying
of
her
attitude
towards
him
it
was
merely
the
result
of
the
chase
all
that
could
be
definitely
charged
against
him
was
the
smoking
of
a
cigar
he
stepped
into
a
and
came
out
with
a
longer
cigar
than
the
first
one
a
more
expensive
article
stripped
off
its
collar
and
lighted
it
as
a
millionaire
might
have
lighted
it
this
was
the
man
who
swore
that
he
did
not
possess
five
francs
she
tracked
him
as
far
as
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
then
lost
him
there
were
vast
surging
crowds
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
much
bunting
and
soldiers
and
gesticulatory
policemen
the
general
effect
of
the
street
was
that
all
things
were
brightly
waving
in
the
breeze
she
was
caught
in
the
crowd
as
in
the
current
of
a
stream
and
when
she
tried
to
sidle
out
of
it
into
a
square
a
row
of
smiling
policemen
barred
her
passage
she
was
a
part
of
the
traffic
that
they
had
to
regulate
she
drifted
till
the
louvre
came
into
view
after
all
gerald
had
only
strolled
forth
to
see
the
sight
of
the
day
whatever
it
might
be
she
knew
not
what
it
was
she
had
no
curiosity
about
it
in
the
middle
of
all
that
thickening
mass
of
humanity
staring
with
one
accord
at
the
vast
monument
of
royal
and
imperial
vanities
she
thought
with
her
characteristic
grimness
of
the
sacrifice
of
her
whole
career
as
a
for
the
chance
of
seeing
gerald
once
a
quarter
in
the
shop
she
gloated
over
that
as
a
sick
appetite
will
gloat
over
tainted
food
and
she
saw
the
shop
and
the
curve
of
the
stairs
up
to
the
showroom
and
the
in
the
showroom
then
the
guns
began
to
boom
again
and
splendid
carriages
swept
one
after
another
from
under
a
majestic
archway
and
glittered
westward
down
a
lane
of
spotless
splendid
uniforms
the
carriages
were
laden
with
still
more
splendid
uniforms
and
with
enchanting
toilets
sophia
in
her
modestly
stylish
black
mechanically
noticed
how
much
easier
it
was
for
attired
women
to
sit
in
a
carriage
now
that
crinolines
had
gone
that
was
the
sole
impression
made
upon
her
by
this
glimpse
of
the
last
fete
of
the
napoleonic
empire
she
knew
not
that
the
supreme
pillars
of
imperialism
were
exhibiting
themselves
before
her
and
that
the
eyes
of
those
uniforms
and
those
toilettes
were
full
of
the
legendary
beauty
of
eugenie
and
their
ears
echoing
to
the
long
phrases
of
napoleon
the
third
about
his
gratitude
to
his
people
for
their
confidence
in
him
as
shown
by
the
plebiscite
and
about
the
ratification
of
constitutional
reforms
guaranteeing
order
and
about
the
empire
having
been
strengthened
at
its
base
and
about
showing
force
by
moderation
and
envisaging
the
future
without
fear
and
about
the
bosom
of
peace
and
liberty
and
the
eternal
continuance
of
his
dynasty
she
just
wondered
vaguely
what
was
afoot
when
the
last
carriage
had
rolled
away
and
the
guns
and
acclamations
had
ceased
the
crowd
at
length
began
to
scatter
she
was
carried
by
it
into
the
place
du
palais
royal
and
in
a
few
moments
she
managed
to
withdraw
into
the
rue
des
bons
enfants
and
was
free
the
coins
in
her
purse
amounted
to
three
sous
and
therefore
though
she
felt
exhausted
to
the
point
of
illness
she
had
to
return
to
the
hotel
on
foot
very
slowly
she
crawled
upwards
in
the
direction
of
the
boulevard
through
the
expiring
gaiety
of
the
city
near
the
bourse
a
fiacre
overtook
her
and
in
the
fiacre
were
gerald
and
a
woman
gerald
had
not
seen
her
he
was
talking
eagerly
to
his
ornate
companion
all
his
body
was
alive
the
fiacre
was
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
but
sophia
judged
instantly
the
grade
of
the
woman
who
was
evidently
of
the
discreet
class
that
frequented
the
big
shops
of
an
afternoon
with
something
of
their
own
to
sell
sophia
grimness
increased
the
pace
of
the
fiacre
her
fatigued
body
gerald
delightful
careless
vivacity
the
attractive
streaming
veil
of
the
nice
modest
courtesan
everything
conspired
to
increase
it
iii
gerald
returned
to
the
bedroom
which
contained
his
wife
and
all
else
that
he
owned
in
the
world
at
about
nine
that
evening
sophia
was
in
bed
she
had
been
driven
to
bed
by
weariness
she
would
have
preferred
to
sit
up
to
receive
her
husband
even
if
it
had
meant
sitting
up
all
night
but
her
body
was
too
heavy
for
her
spirit
she
lay
in
the
dark
she
had
eaten
nothing
gerald
came
straight
into
the
room
he
struck
a
match
which
burned
blue
with
a
stench
for
several
seconds
and
then
gave
a
clear
yellow
flame
he
lit
a
candle
and
saw
his
wife
oh
he
said
you
there
are
you
she
offered
no
reply
wo
speak
eh
he
said
agreeable
sort
of
wife
well
have
you
made
up
your
mind
to
do
what
i
told
you
i
come
back
especially
to
know
she
still
did
not
speak
he
sat
down
with
his
hat
on
and
stuck
out
his
feet
wagging
them
to
and
fro
on
the
heels
i
quite
without
money
he
went
on
and
i
sure
your
people
will
be
glad
to
lend
us
a
bit
till
i
get
some
especially
as
it
a
question
of
you
starving
as
well
as
me
if
i
had
enough
to
pay
your
fares
to
bursley
i
pack
you
off
but
i
have
she
could
only
hear
his
exasperating
voice
the
end
of
the
bed
was
between
her
eyes
and
his
liar
she
said
with
uncompromising
distinctness
the
word
reached
him
barbed
with
all
the
poison
of
her
contempt
and
disgust
there
was
a
pause
oh
i
a
liar
am
i
thanks
i
lied
enough
to
get
you
i
admit
but
you
never
complained
of
that
i
remember
the
new
year
well
with
a
thumping
lie
just
to
have
a
sight
of
you
my
vixen
but
you
did
complain
then
i
took
you
with
only
the
clothes
on
your
back
and
i
spent
every
cent
i
had
on
you
and
now
i
spun
you
call
me
a
liar
she
said
nothing
however
he
went
on
this
is
going
to
come
to
an
end
this
is
he
rose
changed
the
position
of
the
candle
putting
it
on
a
chest
of
drawers
and
then
drew
his
trunk
from
the
wall
and
knelt
in
front
of
it
she
gathered
that
he
was
packing
his
clothes
at
first
she
did
not
comprehend
his
reference
to
beginning
the
new
year
then
his
meaning
revealed
itself
that
story
to
her
mother
about
having
been
attacked
by
ruffians
at
the
bottom
of
king
street
had
been
an
invention
a
ruse
to
account
plausibly
for
his
presence
on
her
mother
doorstep
and
she
had
never
suspected
that
the
story
was
not
true
in
spite
of
her
experience
of
his
lying
she
had
never
suspected
that
that
particular
statement
was
a
lie
what
a
simpleton
she
was
there
was
a
continual
movement
in
the
room
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
a
key
turned
in
the
lock
of
the
trunk
his
head
popped
up
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
this
is
a
joke
you
know
he
said
she
kept
silence
i
give
you
one
more
chance
will
you
write
to
your
mother
or
constance
if
you
like
or
wo
you
she
scorned
to
reply
in
any
way
i
your
husband
he
said
and
it
your
duty
to
obey
me
particularly
in
an
affair
like
this
i
order
you
to
write
to
your
mother
the
corners
of
her
lips
turned
downwards
angered
by
her
mute
obstinacy
he
broke
away
from
the
bed
with
a
sudden
gesture
you
do
as
you
like
he
cried
putting
on
his
overcoat
and
i
shall
do
as
i
like
you
ca
say
i
have
warned
you
it
your
own
deliberate
choice
mind
you
whatever
happens
to
you
you
brought
on
yourself
he
lifted
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
to
get
the
overcoat
exactly
into
place
on
his
shoulders
she
would
not
speak
a
word
not
even
to
insist
that
she
was
indisposed
he
pushed
his
trunk
outside
the
door
and
returned
to
the
bed
you
understand
he
said
menacingly
i
off
she
looked
up
at
the
foul
ceiling
hm
he
sniffed
bringing
his
reserves
of
pride
to
combat
the
persistent
silence
that
was
damaging
his
dignity
and
he
went
off
sticking
his
head
forward
like
a
pugilist
here
she
muttered
you
forgetting
this
he
turned
she
stretched
her
hand
to
the
and
held
up
a
red
circlet
what
is
it
it
the
bit
of
paper
off
the
cigar
you
bought
in
the
rue
montmartre
this
afternoon
she
answered
in
a
significant
tone
he
hesitated
then
swore
violently
and
bounced
out
of
the
room
he
had
made
her
suffer
but
she
was
almost
repaid
for
everything
by
that
moment
of
cruel
triumph
she
exulted
in
it
and
never
forgot
it
five
minutes
later
the
gloomy
menial
in
felt
slippers
and
alpaca
jacket
who
seemed
to
pass
the
whole
of
his
life
flitting
in
and
out
of
bedrooms
like
a
rabbit
in
a
warren
carried
gerald
trunk
downstairs
she
recognized
the
peculiar
tread
of
his
slippers
then
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
the
landlady
entered
actuated
by
a
legitimate
curiosity
madame
is
suffering
the
landlady
began
sophia
refused
offers
of
food
and
nursing
madame
knows
without
doubt
that
monsieur
has
gone
away
has
he
paid
the
bill
sophia
asked
bluntly
but
yes
madame
till
then
madame
has
want
of
nothing
if
you
will
extinguish
the
candle
said
sophia
he
had
deserted
her
then
all
this
she
reflected
listening
in
the
dark
to
the
ceaseless
rattle
of
the
street
because
mother
and
constance
wanted
to
see
the
elephant
and
i
had
to
go
into
father
room
i
should
never
have
caught
sight
of
him
from
the
window
iv
she
passed
a
night
of
physical
misery
exasperated
by
the
tireless
rattling
vitality
of
the
street
she
kept
saying
to
herself
i
all
alone
now
and
i
going
to
be
ill
i
am
she
saw
herself
dying
in
paris
and
heard
the
expressions
of
facile
sympathy
and
idle
curiosity
drawn
forth
by
the
sight
of
the
dead
body
of
this
foreign
woman
in
a
little
paris
hotel
she
reached
the
stage
in
the
gradual
excruciation
of
her
nerves
when
she
was
obliged
to
concentrate
her
agonized
mind
on
an
intense
and
painful
expectancy
of
the
next
new
noise
which
when
it
came
increased
her
torture
and
decreased
her
strength
to
support
it
she
went
through
all
the
interminable
dilatoriness
of
the
dawn
from
the
moment
when
she
could
scarcely
discern
the
window
to
the
moment
when
she
could
read
the
word
on
the
red
circlet
of
paper
which
had
tossed
all
night
on
the
sea
of
the
counterpane
she
knew
she
would
never
sleep
again
she
could
not
imagine
herself
asleep
and
then
she
was
startled
by
a
sound
that
seemed
to
clash
with
the
rest
of
her
impressions
it
was
a
knocking
at
the
door
with
a
start
she
perceived
that
she
must
have
been
asleep
enter
she
murmured
there
entered
the
menial
in
alpaca
his
waxen
face
showed
a
morose
commiseration
he
noiselessly
approached
the
bed
he
seemed
to
have
none
of
the
characteristics
of
a
man
but
to
be
a
creature
infinitely
mysterious
and
aloof
from
humanity
and
held
out
to
sophia
a
visiting
card
in
his
grey
hand
it
was
chirac
card
monsieur
asked
for
monsieur
said
the
waiter
and
then
as
monsieur
had
gone
away
he
demanded
to
see
madame
he
says
it
is
very
important
her
heart
jumped
partly
in
vague
alarm
and
partly
with
a
sense
of
relief
at
this
chance
of
speaking
to
some
one
whom
she
knew
she
tried
to
reflect
rationally
what
time
is
it
she
inquired
eleven
madame
this
was
surprising
the
fact
that
it
was
eleven
destroyed
the
remains
of
her
how
could
it
be
eleven
with
the
dawn
scarcely
finished
he
says
it
is
very
important
repeated
the
waiter
imperturbably
and
solemnly
will
madame
see
him
an
instant
between
resignation
and
anticipation
she
said
yes
it
is
well
madame
said
the
waiter
disappearing
without
a
sound
she
sat
up
and
managed
to
drag
her
matinee
from
a
chair
and
put
it
around
her
shoulders
then
she
sank
back
from
weakness
physical
and
spiritual
she
hated
to
receive
chirac
in
a
bedroom
and
particularly
in
that
bedroom
but
the
hotel
had
no
public
room
except
the
which
began
to
be
occupied
after
eleven
moreover
she
could
not
possibly
get
up
yes
on
the
whole
she
was
pleased
to
see
chirac
he
was
almost
her
only
acquaintance
assuredly
the
only
being
whom
she
could
by
any
stretch
of
meaning
call
a
friend
in
the
whole
of
europe
gerald
and
she
had
wandered
to
and
fro
skimming
always
over
the
real
life
of
nations
and
never
penetrating
into
it
there
was
no
place
for
them
because
they
had
made
none
with
the
exception
of
chirac
whom
an
accident
of
business
had
thrown
into
gerald
company
years
before
they
had
no
social
relations
gerald
was
not
a
man
to
make
friends
he
did
not
seem
to
need
friends
or
at
any
rate
to
feel
the
want
of
them
but
as
chance
had
given
him
chirac
he
maintained
the
connection
whenever
they
came
to
paris
sophia
of
course
had
not
been
able
to
escape
from
the
solitude
imposed
by
existence
in
hotels
since
her
marriage
she
had
never
spoken
to
a
woman
in
the
way
of
intimacy
but
once
or
twice
she
had
approached
intimacy
with
chirac
whose
wistful
admiration
for
her
always
aroused
into
activity
her
desire
to
charm
preceded
by
the
menial
he
came
into
the
room
hurriedly
apologetically
with
an
air
of
acute
anxiety
and
as
he
saw
her
lying
on
her
back
with
flushed
features
her
hair
disarranged
and
only
the
grace
of
the
silk
ribbons
of
her
matinee
to
mitigate
the
melancholy
repulsiveness
of
her
surroundings
that
anxiety
seemed
to
deepen
dear
madame
he
stammered
all
my
excuses
he
hastened
to
the
bedside
and
kissed
her
hand
a
little
peek
according
to
his
custom
you
are
ill
i
have
my
migraine
she
said
you
want
gerald
yes
he
said
diffidently
he
had
promised
he
has
left
me
sophia
interrupted
him
in
her
weak
and
fatigued
voice
she
closed
her
eyes
as
she
uttered
the
words
left
you
he
glanced
round
to
be
sure
that
the
waiter
had
retired
quitted
me
abandoned
me
last
night
not
possible
he
breathed
she
nodded
she
felt
intimate
with
him
like
all
secretive
persons
she
could
be
suddenly
expansive
at
times
it
is
serious
he
questioned
all
that
is
most
serious
she
replied
and
you
ill
ah
the
wretch
ah
the
wretch
that
for
example
he
waved
his
hat
about
what
is
it
you
want
chirac
she
demanded
in
a
confidential
tone
eh
well
said
chirac
you
do
not
know
where
he
has
gone
no
what
do
you
want
she
insisted
he
was
nervous
he
fidgetted
she
guessed
that
though
warm
with
sympathy
for
her
plight
he
was
preoccupied
by
interests
and
apprehensions
of
his
own
he
did
not
refuse
her
request
temporarily
to
leave
the
astonishing
matter
of
her
situation
in
order
to
discuss
the
matter
of
his
visit
eh
well
he
came
to
me
yesterday
afternoon
in
the
rue
croissant
to
borrow
some
money
she
understood
then
the
object
of
gerald
stroll
on
the
previous
afternoon
i
hope
you
did
lend
him
any
she
said
eh
well
it
was
like
this
he
said
he
ought
to
have
received
five
thousand
francs
yesterday
morning
but
that
he
had
had
a
telegram
that
it
would
not
arrive
till
and
he
had
need
of
five
hundred
francs
at
once
i
had
not
five
hundred
francs
he
smiled
sadly
as
if
to
insinuate
that
he
did
not
handle
such
sums
but
i
borrowed
it
from
the
cashbox
of
the
journal
it
is
necessary
absolutely
that
i
should
return
it
this
morning
he
spoke
with
increased
seriousness
your
husband
said
he
would
take
a
cab
and
bring
me
the
money
immediately
on
the
arrival
of
the
post
this
morning
about
nine
pardon
me
for
deranging
you
with
such
a
he
stopped
she
could
see
that
he
really
was
grieved
to
her
but
that
circumstances
pressed
at
my
paper
he
murmured
it
is
not
so
easy
as
that
to
in
fine
gerald
had
genuinely
been
at
his
last
francs
he
had
not
lied
when
she
thought
he
had
lied
the
nakedness
of
his
character
showed
now
instantly
upon
the
final
and
definite
cessation
of
the
lawful
supply
of
money
he
had
set
his
wits
to
obtain
money
unlawfully
he
had
in
fact
simply
stolen
it
from
chirac
with
the
ornamental
addition
of
endangering
chirac
reputation
and
situation
as
a
sort
of
reward
to
chirac
for
the
kindness
and
further
no
sooner
had
he
got
hold
of
the
money
than
it
had
intoxicated
him
and
he
had
yielded
to
the
first
fatuous
temptation
he
had
no
sense
of
responsibility
no
scruple
and
as
for
common
prudence
had
he
not
risked
permanent
disgrace
and
even
prison
for
a
paltry
sum
which
he
would
certainly
squander
in
two
or
three
days
yes
it
was
indubitable
that
he
would
stop
at
nothing
at
nothing
whatever
you
did
not
know
that
he
was
coming
to
me
asked
chirac
pulling
his
short
silky
brown
beard
no
sophia
answered
but
he
said
that
you
had
charged
him
with
your
friendlinesses
to
me
he
nodded
his
head
once
or
twice
sadly
but
candidly
accepting
in
his
quality
of
a
latin
the
plain
facts
of
human
nature
reconciling
himself
to
them
at
once
sophia
revolted
at
this
crowning
detail
of
the
structure
of
rascality
it
is
fortunate
that
i
can
pay
you
she
said
but
he
tried
to
protest
i
have
quite
enough
money
she
did
not
say
this
to
screen
gerald
but
merely
from
she
would
not
let
chirac
think
that
she
was
the
wife
of
a
man
bereft
of
all
honour
and
so
she
clothed
gerald
with
the
rag
of
having
at
any
rate
not
left
her
in
destitution
as
well
as
in
sickness
her
assertion
seemed
a
strange
one
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
had
abandoned
her
on
the
previous
evening
that
is
to
say
immediately
after
the
borrowing
from
chirac
but
chirac
did
not
examine
the
statement
perhaps
he
has
the
intention
to
send
me
the
money
perhaps
after
all
he
is
now
at
the
offices
no
said
sophia
he
is
gone
will
you
go
downstairs
and
wait
for
me
we
will
go
together
to
cook
office
it
is
english
money
i
have
cook
he
repeated
the
word
now
so
potent
had
then
little
significance
but
you
are
you
can
not
i
feel
better
she
did
or
rather
she
felt
nothing
except
the
power
of
her
resolve
to
remove
the
painful
anxiety
from
that
wistful
brow
the
shame
of
the
trick
played
on
chirac
awakened
new
forces
in
her
she
dressed
in
a
physical
torment
which
however
had
no
more
reality
than
a
nightmare
she
searched
in
a
place
where
even
an
inquisitive
husband
would
not
think
of
looking
and
then
painfully
she
descended
the
long
stairs
holding
to
the
rail
which
swam
round
and
round
her
carrying
the
whole
staircase
with
it
after
all
she
thought
i
ca
be
seriously
ill
or
i
should
have
been
able
to
get
up
and
go
out
like
this
i
never
guessed
early
this
morning
that
i
could
do
it
i
ca
possibly
be
as
ill
as
i
thought
i
was
and
in
the
vestibule
she
encountered
chirac
face
lightening
at
the
sight
of
her
which
proved
to
him
that
his
deliverance
was
really
to
be
accomplished
permit
me
i
all
right
she
smiled
tottering
get
a
cab
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
quite
as
easily
have
given
him
the
money
in
english
notes
he
could
have
changed
them
but
she
had
not
thought
her
brain
would
not
operate
she
was
dreaming
and
waking
together
he
helped
her
into
the
cab
v
in
the
bureau
de
change
there
was
a
little
knot
of
english
people
with
naive
romantic
and
honest
faces
quite
different
from
the
faces
outside
in
the
street
no
corruption
in
those
faces
but
a
sort
of
wondering
and
infantile
sincerity
rather
out
of
its
element
and
lost
in
a
land
too
unsophisticated
seeming
to
belong
to
an
earlier
age
sophia
liked
their
tourist
stare
and
their
plain
and
ugly
clothes
she
longed
to
be
back
in
england
longed
for
a
moment
with
violence
drowning
in
that
desire
the
english
clerk
behind
his
brass
bars
took
her
notes
and
carefully
examined
them
one
by
one
she
watched
him
not
entirely
convinced
of
his
reality
and
thought
vaguely
of
the
detestable
morning
when
she
had
abstracted
the
notes
from
gerald
pocket
she
was
filled
with
pity
for
the
simple
ignorant
sophia
of
those
days
the
sophia
who
still
had
a
few
ridiculous
illusions
concerning
gerald
character
often
since
she
had
been
tempted
to
break
into
the
money
but
she
had
always
withstood
the
temptation
saying
to
herself
that
an
hour
of
more
urgent
need
would
come
it
had
come
she
was
proud
of
her
firmness
of
the
force
of
will
which
had
enabled
her
to
reserve
the
fund
intact
the
clerk
gave
her
a
keen
look
and
then
asked
her
how
she
would
take
the
french
money
and
she
saw
the
notes
falling
down
one
after
another
on
to
the
counter
as
the
clerk
separated
them
with
a
snapping
sound
of
the
paper
chirac
was
beside
her
does
that
make
the
count
she
said
having
pushed
towards
him
five
notes
i
should
not
know
how
to
thank
you
he
said
accepting
the
notes
truly
his
joy
was
unmistakably
eager
he
had
had
a
shock
and
a
fright
and
he
now
saw
the
danger
past
he
could
return
to
the
cashier
of
his
newspaper
and
fling
down
the
money
with
a
lordly
and
careless
air
as
if
to
say
when
it
is
a
question
of
these
english
one
can
always
be
sure
but
first
he
would
escort
her
to
the
hotel
she
declined
she
did
not
know
why
for
he
was
her
sole
point
of
moral
support
in
all
france
he
insisted
she
yielded
so
she
turned
her
back
with
regret
on
that
little
english
oasis
in
the
sahara
of
paris
and
staggered
to
the
fiacre
and
now
that
she
had
done
what
she
had
to
do
she
lost
control
of
her
body
and
reclined
flaccid
and
inert
chirac
was
evidently
alarmed
he
did
not
speak
but
glanced
at
her
from
time
to
time
with
eyes
full
of
fear
the
carriage
appeared
to
her
to
be
swimming
amid
waves
over
great
depths
then
she
was
aware
of
a
heavy
weight
against
her
shoulder
she
had
slipped
down
upon
chirac
unconscious
chapter
v
fever
i
then
she
was
lying
in
bed
in
a
small
room
obscure
because
it
was
heavily
curtained
the
light
came
through
the
inner
pair
of
curtains
of
ecru
lace
with
a
beautiful
soft
silvery
quality
a
man
was
standing
by
the
side
of
the
bed
not
chirac
now
madame
he
said
to
her
with
kind
firmness
and
speaking
with
a
charming
exaggerated
purity
of
the
vowels
you
have
the
mucous
fever
i
have
had
it
myself
you
will
be
forced
to
take
baths
very
frequently
i
must
ask
you
to
reconcile
yourself
to
that
to
be
good
she
did
not
reply
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
reply
but
she
certainly
thought
that
this
doctor
he
was
probably
a
doctor
was
overestimating
her
case
she
felt
better
than
she
had
felt
for
two
days
still
she
did
not
desire
to
move
nor
was
she
in
the
least
anxious
as
to
her
surroundings
she
lay
quiet
a
woman
in
a
rather
coquettish
deshabille
watched
over
her
with
expert
skill
later
sophia
seemed
to
be
revisiting
the
sea
on
whose
waves
the
cab
had
swum
but
now
she
was
under
the
sea
in
a
watery
gulf
terribly
deep
and
the
sounds
of
the
world
came
to
her
through
the
water
sudden
and
strange
hands
seized
her
and
forced
her
from
the
subaqueous
grotto
where
she
had
hidden
into
new
alarms
and
she
briefly
perceived
that
there
was
a
large
bath
by
the
side
of
the
bed
and
that
she
was
being
pushed
into
it
the
water
was
icy
cold
after
that
her
outlook
upon
things
was
for
a
time
clearer
and
more
precise
she
knew
from
fragments
of
talk
which
she
heard
that
she
was
put
into
the
cold
bath
by
her
bed
every
three
hours
night
and
day
and
that
she
remained
in
it
for
ten
minutes
always
before
the
bath
she
had
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
and
sometimes
another
glass
while
she
was
in
the
bath
beyond
this
wine
and
occasionally
a
cup
of
soup
she
took
nothing
had
no
wish
to
take
anything
she
grew
perfectly
accustomed
to
these
extraordinary
habits
of
life
to
this
merging
of
night
and
day
into
one
monotonous
and
endless
repetition
of
the
same
rite
amid
the
same
circumstances
on
exactly
the
same
spot
then
followed
a
period
during
which
she
objected
to
being
constantly
wakened
up
for
this
annoying
immersion
and
she
fought
against
it
even
in
her
dreams
long
days
seemed
to
pass
when
she
could
not
be
sure
whether
she
had
been
put
into
the
bath
or
not
when
all
external
phenomena
were
disconcertingly
interwoven
with
matters
which
she
knew
to
be
merely
fanciful
and
then
she
was
overwhelmed
by
the
hopeless
gravity
of
her
state
she
felt
that
her
state
was
desperate
she
felt
that
she
was
dying
her
unhappiness
was
extreme
not
because
she
was
dying
but
because
the
veils
of
sense
were
so
puzzling
so
exasperating
and
because
her
exhausted
body
was
so
vitiated
in
every
fibre
by
disease
she
was
perfectly
aware
that
she
was
going
to
die
she
cried
aloud
for
a
pair
of
scissors
she
wanted
to
cut
off
her
hair
and
to
send
part
of
it
to
constance
and
part
of
it
to
her
mother
in
separate
packages
she
insisted
upon
separate
packages
nobody
would
give
her
a
pair
of
scissors
she
implored
meekly
haughtily
furiously
but
nobody
would
satisfy
her
it
seemed
to
her
shocking
that
all
her
hair
should
go
with
her
into
her
coffin
while
constance
and
her
mother
had
nothing
by
which
to
remember
her
no
tangible
souvenir
of
her
beauty
then
she
fought
for
the
scissors
she
clutched
at
some
one
always
through
those
baffling
veils
who
was
putting
her
into
the
bath
by
the
bedside
and
fought
frantically
it
appeared
to
her
that
this
some
one
was
the
rather
stout
woman
who
had
supped
at
sylvain
with
the
quarrelsome
englishman
four
years
ago
she
could
not
rid
herself
of
this
singular
conceit
though
she
knew
it
to
be
absurd
a
long
time
afterwards
it
seemed
like
a
century
she
did
actually
and
unmistakably
see
the
woman
sitting
by
her
bed
and
the
woman
was
crying
why
are
you
crying
sophia
asked
wonderingly
and
the
other
younger
woman
who
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
replied
you
do
well
to
ask
it
is
you
who
have
hurt
her
in
your
delirium
when
you
so
madly
demanded
the
scissors
the
stout
woman
smiled
with
the
tears
on
her
cheeks
but
sophia
wept
from
remorse
the
stout
woman
looked
old
worn
and
untidy
the
other
one
was
much
younger
sophia
did
not
trouble
to
inquire
from
them
who
they
were
that
little
conversation
formed
a
brief
interlude
in
the
delirium
which
overtook
her
again
and
distorted
everything
she
forgot
however
that
she
was
destined
to
die
one
day
her
brain
cleared
she
could
be
sure
that
she
had
gone
to
sleep
in
the
morning
and
not
wakened
till
the
evening
hence
she
had
not
been
put
into
the
bath
have
i
had
my
baths
she
questioned
it
was
the
doctor
who
faced
her
no
he
said
the
baths
are
finished
she
knew
from
his
face
that
she
was
out
of
danger
moreover
she
was
conscious
of
a
new
feeling
in
her
body
as
though
the
fount
of
physical
energy
within
her
long
interrupted
had
recommenced
to
flow
but
very
slowly
a
trickling
it
was
a
rebirth
she
was
not
glad
but
her
body
itself
was
glad
her
body
had
an
existence
of
its
own
she
was
now
often
left
by
herself
in
the
bedroom
to
the
right
of
the
foot
of
the
bed
was
a
piano
in
walnut
and
to
the
left
a
with
a
large
mirror
she
wanted
to
look
at
herself
in
the
mirror
but
it
was
a
very
long
way
off
she
tried
to
sit
up
and
could
not
she
hoped
that
one
day
she
would
be
able
to
get
as
far
as
the
mirror
she
said
not
a
word
about
this
to
either
of
the
two
women
often
they
would
sit
in
the
bedroom
and
talk
without
ceasing
sophia
learnt
that
the
stout
woman
was
named
foucault
and
the
other
laurence
sometimes
laurence
would
address
madame
foucault
as
aimee
but
usually
she
was
more
formal
madame
foucault
always
called
the
other
laurence
sophia
curiosity
stirred
and
awoke
but
she
could
not
obtain
any
very
exact
information
as
to
where
she
was
except
that
the
house
was
in
the
rue
breda
off
the
rue
notre
dame
de
lorette
she
recollected
vaguely
that
the
reputation
of
the
street
was
sinister
it
appeared
that
on
the
day
when
she
had
gone
out
with
chirac
the
upper
part
of
the
rue
notre
dame
de
lorette
was
closed
for
repairs
this
she
remembered
and
that
the
cabman
had
turned
up
the
rue
breda
in
order
to
make
a
detour
and
that
it
was
just
opposite
to
the
house
of
madame
foucault
that
she
had
lost
consciousness
madame
foucault
happened
to
be
getting
into
a
cab
at
the
moment
but
she
had
told
chirac
nevertheless
to
carry
sophia
into
the
house
and
a
policeman
had
helped
then
when
the
doctor
came
it
was
discovered
that
she
could
not
be
moved
save
to
a
hospital
and
both
madame
foucault
and
laurence
were
determined
that
no
friend
of
chirac
should
be
committed
to
the
horrors
of
a
paris
hospital
madame
foucault
had
suffered
in
one
as
a
patient
and
laurence
had
been
a
nurse
in
another
chirac
was
now
away
the
women
talked
loosely
of
a
war
how
kind
you
have
been
murmured
sophia
with
humid
eyes
but
they
silenced
her
with
gestures
she
was
not
to
talk
they
seemed
to
have
nothing
further
to
tell
her
they
said
chirac
would
be
returning
perhaps
soon
and
that
she
could
talk
to
him
evidently
they
both
held
chirac
in
affection
they
said
often
that
he
was
a
charming
boy
bit
by
bit
sophia
comprehended
the
length
and
the
seriousness
of
her
illness
and
the
immense
devotion
of
the
two
women
and
the
terrific
disturbance
of
their
lives
and
her
own
debility
she
saw
that
the
women
were
strongly
attached
to
her
and
she
could
not
understand
why
as
she
had
never
done
anything
for
them
whereas
they
had
done
everything
for
her
she
had
not
learnt
that
benefits
rendered
not
benefits
received
are
the
cause
of
such
attachments
all
the
time
she
was
plotting
and
gathering
her
strength
to
disobey
orders
and
get
as
far
as
the
mirror
her
preliminary
studies
and
her
preparations
were
as
elaborate
as
those
of
a
prisoner
arranging
to
escape
from
a
fortress
the
first
attempt
was
a
failure
the
second
succeeded
though
she
could
not
stand
without
support
she
managed
by
clinging
to
the
bed
to
reach
a
chair
and
to
push
the
chair
in
front
of
her
until
it
approached
the
mirror
the
enterprise
was
exciting
and
terrific
then
she
saw
a
face
in
the
glass
white
incredibly
emaciated
with
great
wild
staring
eyes
and
the
shoulders
were
bent
as
though
with
age
it
was
a
painful
almost
a
horrible
sight
it
frightened
her
so
that
in
her
alarm
she
recoiled
from
it
not
attending
sufficiently
to
the
chair
she
sank
to
the
ground
she
could
not
pick
herself
up
and
she
was
caught
there
miserably
by
her
angered
jailers
the
vision
of
her
face
taught
her
more
efficiently
than
anything
else
the
gravity
of
her
adventure
as
the
women
lifted
her
inert
repentant
mass
into
the
bed
she
reflected
how
queer
my
life
is
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
ought
to
have
been
trimming
hats
in
the
showroom
instead
of
being
in
that
curtained
mysterious
parisian
interior
ii
one
day
madame
foucault
knocked
at
the
door
of
sophia
little
room
this
ceremony
of
knocking
was
one
of
the
indications
that
sophia
convalescent
had
been
reinstated
in
her
rights
as
an
individual
and
cried
madame
one
is
going
to
leave
you
all
alone
for
some
time
come
in
said
sophia
who
was
sitting
up
in
an
armchair
and
reading
madame
foucault
opened
the
door
one
is
going
to
leave
you
all
alone
for
some
time
she
repeated
in
a
low
confidential
voice
sharply
contrasting
with
her
shriek
behind
the
door
sophia
nodded
and
smiled
and
madame
foucault
also
nodded
and
smiled
but
madame
foucault
face
quickly
resumed
its
anxious
expression
the
servant
brother
marries
himself
and
she
implored
me
to
accord
her
two
days
what
would
you
madame
laurence
is
out
and
i
must
go
out
it
is
four
i
shall
at
six
striking
therefore
perfectly
sophia
concurred
she
looked
curiously
at
madame
foucault
who
was
carefully
made
up
and
arranged
for
the
street
in
a
dress
of
yellow
tussore
with
blue
ornaments
bright
gloves
a
little
blue
bonnet
and
a
little
white
parasol
not
wider
when
opened
than
her
shoulders
cheeks
lips
and
eyes
were
heavily
charged
with
rouge
powder
or
black
and
that
too
abundant
waist
had
been
most
cunningly
confined
in
a
belt
that
descended
beneath
instead
of
rising
above
the
lower
masses
of
the
vast
torso
the
general
effect
was
worthy
of
the
effort
that
must
have
gone
to
it
madame
foucault
was
not
rejuvenated
by
her
toilette
but
it
almost
procured
her
pardon
for
the
crime
of
being
over
forty
fat
creased
and
worn
out
it
was
one
of
those
defeats
that
are
a
triumph
you
are
very
chic
said
sophia
uttering
her
admiration
ah
said
madame
foucault
shrugging
the
shoulders
of
disillusion
chic
what
does
that
do
but
she
was
pleased
the
banged
sophia
by
herself
for
the
first
time
in
the
flat
into
which
she
had
been
carried
unconscious
and
which
she
had
never
since
left
had
the
disturbing
sensation
of
being
surrounded
by
mysterious
rooms
and
mysterious
things
she
tried
to
continue
reading
but
the
sentences
conveyed
nothing
to
her
she
rose
she
could
walk
now
a
little
and
looked
out
of
the
window
through
the
interstices
of
the
pattern
of
the
lace
curtains
the
window
gave
on
the
courtyard
which
was
about
sixteen
feet
below
her
a
low
wall
divided
the
courtyard
from
that
of
the
next
house
and
the
windows
of
the
two
houses
only
to
be
distinguished
by
the
different
tints
of
their
yellow
paint
rose
tier
above
tier
in
level
floors
continuing
beyond
sophia
field
of
vision
she
pressed
her
face
against
the
glass
and
remembered
the
square
of
her
childhood
and
just
as
there
from
the
showroom
window
she
could
not
even
by
pressing
her
face
against
the
glass
see
the
pavement
so
here
she
could
not
see
the
roof
the
courtyard
was
like
the
bottom
of
a
well
there
was
no
end
to
the
windows
six
storeys
she
could
count
and
the
sills
of
a
seventh
were
the
limit
of
her
view
every
window
was
heavily
curtained
like
her
own
some
of
the
upper
ones
had
green
sunblinds
scarcely
any
sound
mysteries
brooded
without
as
well
as
within
the
flat
of
madame
foucault
sophia
saw
a
bodiless
hand
twitch
at
a
curtain
and
vanish
she
noticed
a
green
bird
in
a
tiny
cage
on
a
sill
in
the
next
house
a
woman
whom
she
took
to
be
the
concierge
appeared
in
the
courtyard
deposited
a
small
plant
in
the
track
of
a
ray
of
sunshine
that
lighted
a
corner
for
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
afternoon
and
disappeared
again
then
she
heard
a
piano
somewhere
that
was
all
the
feeling
that
secret
and
strange
lives
were
being
lived
behind
those
baffling
windows
that
humanity
was
everywhere
intimately
pulsing
around
her
oppressed
her
spirit
yet
not
quite
unpleasantly
the
environment
softened
her
glance
upon
the
spectacle
of
existence
insomuch
that
sadness
became
a
voluptuous
pleasure
and
the
environment
threw
her
back
on
herself
into
a
sensuous
contemplation
of
the
fundamental
fact
of
sophia
scales
formerly
sophia
baines
she
turned
to
the
room
with
the
marks
of
the
bath
on
the
floor
by
the
bed
and
the
draped
piano
that
was
never
opened
and
her
two
trunks
filling
up
the
corner
opposite
the
door
she
had
the
idea
of
thoroughly
examining
those
trunks
which
chirac
or
somebody
else
must
have
fetched
from
the
hotel
at
the
top
of
one
of
them
was
her
purse
tied
up
with
old
ribbon
and
ostentatiously
sealed
how
comical
these
french
people
were
when
they
deemed
it
necessary
to
be
serious
she
emptied
both
trunks
scrutinizing
minutely
all
her
goods
and
thinking
of
the
varied
occasions
upon
which
she
had
obtained
them
then
she
carefully
restored
them
her
mind
full
of
souvenirs
newly
awakened
she
sighed
as
she
straightened
her
back
a
clock
struck
in
another
room
it
seemed
to
invite
her
towards
discoveries
she
had
been
in
no
other
room
of
the
flat
she
knew
nothing
of
the
rest
of
the
flat
save
by
sound
for
neither
of
the
other
women
had
ever
described
it
nor
had
it
occurred
to
them
that
sophia
might
care
to
leave
her
room
though
she
could
not
leave
the
house
she
opened
her
door
and
glanced
along
the
dim
corridor
with
which
she
was
familiar
she
knew
that
the
kitchen
lay
next
to
her
little
room
and
that
next
to
the
kitchen
came
the
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
corridor
were
four
she
crossed
to
the
pair
of
doors
facing
her
own
little
door
and
quietly
turned
the
handle
but
the
doors
were
locked
the
same
with
the
next
pair
the
third
pair
yielded
and
she
was
in
a
large
bedroom
with
three
windows
on
the
street
she
saw
that
the
second
pair
of
doors
which
she
had
failed
to
unfasten
also
opened
into
this
room
between
the
two
pairs
of
doors
was
a
wide
bed
in
front
of
the
central
window
was
a
large
to
the
left
of
the
bed
half
hiding
the
locked
doors
was
a
large
screen
on
the
marble
mantelpiece
reflected
in
a
huge
mirror
that
ascended
to
the
ornate
cornice
was
a
clock
with
pendants
to
match
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
from
this
was
a
long
wide
couch
the
floor
was
of
polished
oak
with
a
skin
on
either
side
of
the
bed
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
was
a
small
with
a
penny
bottle
of
ink
on
it
a
few
coloured
prints
and
engravings
representing
for
example
louis
philippe
and
his
family
and
people
perishing
on
a
raft
broke
the
tedium
of
the
walls
the
first
impression
on
sophia
eye
was
one
of
sombre
splendour
everything
had
the
air
of
being
richly
ornamented
draped
looped
carved
twisted
brocaded
into
gorgeousness
the
dark
crimson
fell
from
massive
rosettes
in
majestic
folds
the
counterpane
was
covered
with
lace
the
had
amplitude
beyond
the
necessary
and
they
were
suspended
from
behind
fringed
and
pleated
valances
the
green
sofa
and
its
sateen
cushions
were
stiff
with
applied
embroidery
the
chandelier
hanging
from
the
middle
of
the
ceiling
modelled
to
represent
cupids
holding
festoons
was
a
glittering
confusion
of
gilt
and
lustres
the
lustres
tinkled
when
sophia
stood
on
a
certain
part
of
the
floor
the
chairs
were
completely
gilded
there
was
an
effect
of
spaciousness
and
the
situation
of
the
bed
between
the
two
with
the
three
windows
in
front
and
other
pairs
of
doors
communicating
with
other
rooms
on
either
hand
produced
in
addition
an
admirable
symmetry
but
sophia
with
the
sharp
gaze
of
a
woman
brought
up
in
the
traditions
of
a
modesty
so
proud
that
it
scorns
ostentation
quickly
tested
and
condemned
the
details
of
this
chamber
that
imitated
every
luxury
nothing
in
it
she
found
was
and
in
luke
square
meant
honest
workmanship
permanence
the
absence
of
pretence
all
the
stuffs
were
cheap
and
showy
and
shabby
all
the
furniture
was
cracked
warped
or
broken
the
clock
showed
five
minutes
past
twelve
at
five
and
further
dust
was
everywhere
except
in
those
places
where
even
the
most
perfunctory
cleaning
could
not
have
left
it
in
the
obscurer
pleatings
of
draperies
it
lay
thick
lip
curled
and
instinctively
she
lifted
her
peignoir
one
of
her
mother
phrases
came
into
her
head
lick
and
a
promise
and
then
another
if
you
want
to
leave
dirt
leave
it
where
everybody
can
see
it
not
in
the
corners
she
peeped
behind
the
screen
and
all
the
horrible
welter
of
a
cabinet
de
toilette
met
her
gaze
a
repulsive
medley
of
foul
waters
stained
vessels
and
cloths
brushes
sponges
powders
and
pastes
clothes
were
hung
up
in
disorder
on
rough
nails
among
them
she
recognized
a
of
madame
foucault
and
behind
affairs
of
later
date
the
dazzling
scarlet
cloak
in
which
she
had
first
seen
madame
foucault
dilapidated
now
so
this
was
madame
foucault
room
this
was
the
bower
from
which
that
elegance
emerged
the
filth
from
which
had
sprung
the
mature
blossom
she
passed
from
that
room
direct
to
another
of
which
the
shutters
were
closed
leaving
it
in
twilight
this
room
too
was
a
bedroom
rather
smaller
than
the
middle
one
and
having
only
one
window
but
furnished
with
the
same
dubious
opulence
dust
covered
it
everywhere
and
small
footmarks
were
visible
in
the
dust
on
the
floor
at
the
back
was
a
small
door
papered
to
match
the
wall
and
within
this
door
was
a
cabinet
de
toilette
with
no
light
and
no
air
neither
in
the
room
nor
in
the
closet
was
there
any
sign
of
individual
habitation
she
traversed
the
main
bedroom
again
and
found
another
bedroom
to
balance
the
second
one
but
open
to
the
full
light
of
day
and
in
a
state
of
extreme
disorder
the
bed
had
not
even
been
made
clothes
and
towels
draped
all
the
furniture
shoes
were
about
the
floor
and
on
a
piece
of
string
tied
across
the
windows
hung
a
single
white
stocking
wet
at
the
back
was
a
cabinet
de
toilette
as
dark
as
the
other
one
a
vile
malodorous
mess
of
appliances
whose
familiar
forms
loomed
vague
and
extraordinarily
sinister
in
the
dense
obscurity
sophia
turned
away
with
the
righteous
disgust
of
one
whose
preparations
for
the
gaze
of
the
world
are
as
candid
and
simple
as
those
of
a
child
concealed
dirt
shocked
her
as
much
as
it
would
have
shocked
her
mother
and
as
for
the
trickeries
of
the
toilet
table
she
contemned
them
as
harshly
as
a
young
saint
who
has
never
been
tempted
contemns
moral
weakness
she
thought
of
the
strange
flaccid
daily
life
of
those
two
women
whose
hours
seemed
to
slip
unprofitably
away
without
any
result
of
achievement
she
had
actually
witnessed
nothing
but
since
the
beginning
of
her
convalescence
her
ears
had
heard
and
she
could
piece
the
evidences
together
there
was
never
any
sound
in
the
flat
outside
the
kitchen
until
noon
then
vague
noises
and
smells
would
commence
and
about
one
madame
foucault
disarrayed
would
come
to
inquire
if
the
servant
had
attended
to
the
needs
of
the
invalid
then
the
odours
of
cookery
would
accentuate
themselves
bells
rang
fragments
of
conversations
escaped
through
doors
ajar
occasionally
a
man
voice
or
a
heavy
step
then
the
fragrance
of
coffee
sometimes
the
sound
of
a
kiss
the
banging
of
the
front
door
the
noise
of
brushing
or
of
the
shaking
of
a
carpet
a
little
scream
as
at
some
trifling
domestic
contretemps
laurence
still
in
a
would
lounge
into
sophia
room
dirty
haggard
but
polite
with
a
curious
stiff
ceremony
and
would
drink
her
coffee
there
this
wandering
in
peignoirs
would
continue
till
three
and
then
laurence
might
say
as
if
nerving
herself
to
an
unusual
and
immense
effort
i
must
be
dressed
by
five
i
have
not
a
moment
often
madame
foucault
did
not
dress
at
all
on
such
days
she
would
go
to
bed
immediately
after
dinner
with
the
remark
that
she
did
know
what
was
the
matter
with
her
but
she
was
exhausted
and
then
the
servant
would
retire
to
her
seventh
floor
and
there
would
be
silence
until
now
and
then
faint
creepings
were
heard
at
midnight
or
after
once
or
twice
through
the
chinks
of
her
door
sophia
had
seen
a
light
at
two
in
the
morning
just
before
the
dawn
yet
these
were
the
women
who
had
saved
her
life
who
between
them
had
put
her
into
a
cold
bath
every
three
hours
night
and
day
for
weeks
surely
it
was
impossible
after
that
to
despise
them
for
shiftlessness
and
talkative
idling
in
peignoirs
impossible
to
despise
them
for
anything
whatever
but
sophia
conscious
of
her
inheritance
of
strong
and
resolute
character
did
despise
them
as
poor
things
the
one
point
on
which
she
envied
them
was
their
formal
manners
to
her
which
seemed
to
become
more
dignified
and
graciously
distant
as
her
health
improved
it
was
always
to
her
with
an
intonation
of
increasing
deference
they
might
have
been
apologizing
to
her
for
themselves
she
prowled
into
all
the
corners
of
the
flat
but
she
discovered
no
more
rooms
nothing
but
a
large
cupboard
crammed
with
madame
dresses
then
she
went
back
to
the
large
bedroom
and
enjoyed
the
busy
movement
and
rattle
of
the
sloping
street
and
had
long
vague
yearnings
for
strength
and
for
freedom
in
wide
sane
places
she
decided
that
on
the
morrow
she
would
dress
herself
and
never
again
wear
a
peignoir
the
peignoir
and
all
that
it
represented
disgusted
her
and
while
looking
at
the
street
she
ceased
to
see
it
and
saw
cook
office
and
chirac
helping
her
into
the
carriage
where
was
he
why
had
he
brought
her
to
this
impossible
abode
what
did
he
mean
by
such
conduct
but
could
he
have
acted
otherwise
he
had
done
the
one
thing
that
he
could
do
chance
chance
and
why
an
impossible
abode
was
one
place
more
impossible
than
another
all
this
came
of
running
away
from
home
with
gerald
it
was
remarkable
that
she
seldom
thought
of
gerald
he
had
vanished
from
her
life
as
he
had
come
into
it
madly
preposterously
she
wondered
what
the
next
stage
in
her
career
would
be
she
certainly
could
not
forecast
it
perhaps
gerald
was
starving
or
in
prison
bah
that
exclamation
expressed
her
appalling
disdain
of
gerald
and
of
the
sophia
who
had
once
deemed
him
the
paragon
of
men
bah
a
carriage
stopping
in
front
of
the
house
awakened
her
from
her
meditation
madame
foucault
and
a
man
very
much
younger
than
madame
foucault
got
out
of
it
sophia
fled
after
all
this
prying
into
other
people
rooms
was
quite
inexcusable
she
dropped
on
to
her
own
bed
and
picked
up
a
book
in
case
madame
foucault
should
come
in
iii
in
the
evening
just
after
night
had
fallen
sophia
on
the
bed
heard
the
sound
of
raised
and
acrimonious
voices
in
madame
foucault
room
nothing
except
dinner
had
happened
since
the
arrival
of
madame
foucault
and
the
young
man
these
two
had
evidently
dined
informally
in
the
bedroom
on
a
dish
or
so
prepared
by
madame
foucault
who
had
herself
served
sophia
with
her
invalid
repast
the
odours
of
cookery
still
hung
in
the
air
the
noise
of
virulent
discussion
increased
and
continued
and
then
sophia
could
hear
sobbing
broken
by
short
and
fierce
phrases
from
the
man
then
the
door
of
the
bedroom
opened
brusquely
ai
soupe
exclaimed
the
man
in
tones
of
angry
disgust
je
te
prie
and
then
a
soft
muffled
sound
as
of
a
struggle
a
quick
step
and
the
very
violent
banging
of
the
front
door
after
that
there
was
a
noticeable
silence
save
for
the
regular
sobbing
sophia
wondered
when
it
would
cease
that
monotonous
sobbing
what
is
the
matter
she
called
out
from
her
bed
the
sobbing
grew
louder
like
the
sobbing
of
a
child
who
has
detected
an
awakening
of
sympathy
and
instinctively
begins
to
practise
upon
it
in
the
end
sophia
arose
and
put
on
the
peignoir
which
she
had
almost
determined
never
to
wear
again
the
broad
corridor
was
lighted
by
a
small
smelling
with
a
crimson
globe
that
soft
transforming
radiance
seemed
to
paint
the
whole
corridor
with
voluptuous
luxury
so
much
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
the
smell
came
from
the
lamp
under
the
lamp
lay
madame
foucault
on
the
floor
a
shapeless
mass
of
lace
frilled
linen
and
corset
her
light
brown
hair
was
loose
and
spread
about
the
floor
at
the
first
glance
the
creature
abandoned
to
grief
made
a
romantic
and
striking
picture
and
sophia
thought
for
an
instant
that
she
had
at
length
encountered
life
on
a
plane
that
would
correspond
to
her
dreams
of
romance
and
she
was
impressed
with
a
feeling
somewhat
akin
to
that
of
a
middling
commoner
when
confronted
with
a
viscount
there
was
in
the
distance
something
imposing
and
sensational
about
that
prone
trembling
figure
the
tragic
works
of
love
were
therein
apparently
manifest
in
a
sort
of
dignified
beauty
but
when
sophia
bent
over
madame
foucault
and
touched
her
flabbiness
this
illusion
at
once
vanished
and
instead
of
being
dramatically
pathetic
the
woman
was
ridiculous
her
face
especially
as
damaged
by
tears
could
not
support
the
ordeal
of
inspection
it
was
horrible
not
a
picture
but
a
palette
or
like
the
coloured
design
of
a
pavement
artist
after
a
heavy
shower
her
great
relaxed
eyelids
alone
would
have
rendered
any
face
absurd
and
there
were
monstrous
details
far
worse
than
the
eyelids
then
she
was
amazingly
fat
her
flesh
seemed
to
be
escaping
at
all
ends
from
a
corset
strained
to
the
utmost
limit
and
above
her
boots
she
was
still
wearing
dainty
tightly
laced
boots
the
calves
bulged
suddenly
out
as
a
woman
of
between
forty
and
fifty
the
obese
sepulchre
of
a
dead
vulgar
beauty
she
had
no
right
to
passions
and
tears
and
homage
or
even
the
means
of
life
she
had
no
right
to
expose
herself
picturesquely
beneath
a
crimson
glow
in
all
the
panoply
of
ribboned
garters
and
lacy
seductiveness
it
was
silly
it
was
disgraceful
she
ought
to
have
known
that
only
youth
and
slimness
have
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
feelings
by
indecent
abandonments
such
were
the
thoughts
that
mingled
with
the
sympathy
of
the
beautiful
and
slim
sophia
as
she
bent
down
to
madame
foucault
she
was
sorry
for
her
landlady
but
at
the
same
time
she
despised
her
and
resented
her
woe
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
quietly
he
has
chucked
me
stammered
madame
foucault
and
he
the
last
i
have
no
one
now
she
rolled
over
in
the
most
grotesque
manner
kicking
up
her
legs
with
a
fresh
outburst
of
sobs
sophia
felt
quite
ashamed
for
her
come
and
lie
down
come
now
she
said
with
a
touch
of
sharpness
you
mus
lie
there
like
that
madame
foucault
behaviour
was
really
too
outrageous
sophia
helped
her
morally
rather
than
physically
to
rise
and
then
persuaded
her
into
the
large
bedroom
madame
foucault
fell
on
the
bed
of
which
the
counterpane
had
been
thrown
over
the
foot
sophia
covered
the
lower
part
of
her
heaving
body
with
the
counterpane
now
calm
yourself
please
this
room
too
was
lit
in
crimson
by
a
small
lamp
that
stood
on
the
and
though
the
shade
of
the
lamp
was
cracked
the
general
effect
of
the
great
chamber
was
incontestably
romantic
only
the
pillows
of
the
wide
bed
and
a
small
of
floor
were
illuminated
all
the
rest
lay
in
shadow
madame
foucault
head
had
dropped
between
the
pillows
a
tray
containing
dirty
plates
and
glasses
and
a
was
speciously
picturesque
on
the
despite
her
genuine
gratitude
to
madame
foucault
for
astounding
care
during
her
illness
sophia
did
not
like
her
landlady
and
the
present
scene
made
her
coldly
wrathful
she
saw
the
probability
of
having
another
troubles
piled
on
the
top
of
her
own
she
did
not
in
her
mind
actively
object
because
she
felt
that
she
could
not
be
more
hopelessly
miserable
than
she
was
but
she
passively
resented
the
imposition
her
reason
told
her
that
she
ought
to
sympathize
with
this
ageing
ugly
disagreeable
undignified
woman
but
her
heart
was
reluctant
her
heart
did
not
want
to
know
anything
at
all
about
madame
foucault
nor
to
enter
in
any
way
into
her
private
life

have
not
a
single
friend
now
stammered
madame
foucault
oh
yes
you
have
said
sophia
cheerfully
you
have
madame
laurence
laurence
that
is
not
a
friend
you
know
what
i
mean
and
me
i
am
your
friend
said
sophia
in
obedience
to
her
conscience
you
are
very
kind
replied
madame
foucault
from
the
pillow
but
you
know
what
i
mean
the
fact
was
that
sophia
did
know
what
she
meant
the
terms
of
their
intercourse
had
been
suddenly
changed
there
was
no
pretentious
ceremony
now
but
the
sincerity
that
disaster
brings
the
vast
structure
of
which
between
them
they
had
gradually
built
had
crumbled
to
nothing
i
never
treated
badly
any
man
in
my
life
whimpered
madame
foucault
i
have
always
been
a
good
girl
there
is
not
a
man
who
can
say
i
have
not
been
a
good
girl
never
was
i
a
girl
like
the
rest
and
every
one
has
said
so
ah
when
i
tell
you
that
once
i
had
a
hotel
in
the
avenue
de
la
reine
hortense
four
horses
i
have
sold
a
horse
to
madame
musard
you
know
madame
musard
but
one
can
not
make
economies
impossible
to
make
economies
ah
in
i
was
spending
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
that
can
not
last
always
i
have
said
to
myself
can
not
last
always
i
had
the
intention
but
what
would
you
i
installed
myself
here
and
borrowed
money
to
pay
for
the
furniture
there
did
not
remain
to
me
one
jewel
the
men
are
poltroons
all
i
could
let
three
bedrooms
for
three
hundred
and
fifty
francs
a
month
and
with
serving
meals
and
so
on
i
could
live
then
that
sophia
interrupted
pointing
to
her
own
bedroom
across
the
corridor
is
your
room
yes
said
madame
foucault
i
put
you
in
it
because
at
the
moment
all
these
were
let
they
are
so
no
longer
only
one
laurence
and
she
does
not
pay
me
always
what
would
you
tenants
that
does
not
find
itself
at
the
present
hour
i
have
nothing
and
i
owe
and
he
quits
me
he
chooses
this
moment
to
quit
me
and
why
for
nothing
for
nothing
that
is
not
for
his
money
that
i
regret
him
no
no
you
know
at
his
age
he
is
and
with
a
woman
like
me
one
is
not
generous
no
i
loved
him
and
then
a
man
is
a
moral
support
always
i
loved
him
it
is
at
my
age
mine
that
one
knows
how
to
love
beauty
goes
always
but
not
the
temperament
ah
that
no
i
loved
him
i
love
him
sophia
face
tingled
with
a
sudden
emotion
caused
by
the
repetition
of
those
last
three
words
whose
spell
no
usage
can
mar
but
she
said
nothing
do
you
know
what
i
shall
become
there
is
nothing
but
that
for
me
and
i
know
of
such
who
are
there
already
a
charwoman
yes
a
charwoman
more
soon
or
more
late
well
that
is
life
what
would
you
one
exists
always
then
in
a
different
tone
i
demand
your
pardon
madame
for
talking
like
this
i
ought
to
have
shame
and
sophia
felt
that
in
listening
she
also
ought
to
be
ashamed
but
she
was
not
ashamed
everything
seemed
very
natural
and
even
ordinary
and
moreover
sophia
was
full
of
the
sense
of
her
superiority
over
the
woman
on
the
bed
four
years
ago
in
the
restaurant
sylvain
the
ingenuous
and
ignorant
sophia
had
shyly
sat
in
awe
of
the
resplendent
courtesan
with
her
haughty
stare
her
large
easy
gestures
and
her
imperturbable
contempt
for
the
man
who
was
paying
and
now
sophia
knew
that
she
sophia
knew
all
that
was
to
be
known
about
human
nature
she
had
not
merely
youth
beauty
and
virtue
but
knowledge
knowledge
enough
to
reconcile
her
to
her
own
misery
she
had
a
vigorous
clear
mind
and
a
clean
conscience
she
could
look
any
one
in
the
face
and
judge
every
one
too
as
a
woman
of
the
world
whereas
this
obscene
wreck
on
the
bed
had
nothing
whatever
left
she
had
not
merely
lost
her
effulgent
beauty
she
had
become
repulsive
she
could
never
have
had
any
commonsense
nor
any
force
of
character
her
haughtiness
in
the
day
of
glory
was
simply
fatuous
based
on
stupidity
she
had
passed
the
years
in
idleness
trailing
about
all
day
in
stuffy
rooms
and
emerging
at
night
to
impress
nincompoops
continually
meaning
to
do
things
which
she
never
did
continually
surprised
at
the
lateness
of
the
hour
continually
occupied
with
the
most
foolish
trifles
and
here
she
was
at
over
forty
writhing
about
on
the
bare
floor
because
a
boy
of
who
must
be
a
worthless
idiot
had
abandoned
her
after
a
scene
of
ridiculous
shoutings
and
stampings
she
was
dependent
on
the
caprices
of
a
young
scamp
the
last
donkey
to
turn
from
her
with
loathing
sophia
thought
goodness
if
i
had
been
in
her
place
i
should
have
been
like
that
i
should
have
been
rich
i
should
have
saved
like
a
miser
i
would
have
been
dependent
on
anybody
at
that
age
if
i
could
have
made
a
better
courtesan
than
this
pitiable
woman
i
would
have
drowned
myself
in
the
harsh
vanity
of
her
conscious
capableness
and
young
strength
she
thought
thus
half
forgetting
her
own
follies
and
half
excusing
them
on
the
ground
of
inexperience
sophia
wanted
to
go
round
the
flat
and
destroy
every
crimson
lampshade
in
it
she
wanted
to
shake
madame
foucault
into
and
sagacity
moral
reprehension
though
present
in
her
mind
was
only
faint
certainly
she
felt
the
immense
gulf
between
the
honest
woman
and
the
wanton
but
she
did
not
feel
it
as
she
would
have
expected
to
feel
it
what
a
fool
you
have
been
she
thought
not
what
a
sinner
with
her
precocious
cynicism
which
was
somewhat
unsuited
to
the
lovely
northern
youthfulness
of
that
face
she
said
to
herself
that
the
whole
situation
and
their
relative
attitudes
would
have
been
different
if
only
madame
foucault
had
had
the
wit
to
amass
a
fortune
as
according
to
gerald
some
of
her
rivals
had
succeeded
in
doing
and
all
the
time
she
was
thinking
in
another
part
of
her
mind
i
ought
not
to
be
here
it
no
use
arguing
i
ought
not
to
be
here
chirac
did
the
only
thing
for
me
there
was
to
do
but
i
must
go
now
madame
foucault
continued
to
recite
her
woes
chiefly
financial
in
a
weak
voice
damp
with
tears
she
also
continued
to
apologize
for
mentioning
herself
she
had
finished
sobbing
and
lay
looking
at
the
wall
away
from
sophia
who
stood
irresolute
near
the
bed
ashamed
for
her
companion
weakness
and
incapacity
you
must
not
forget
said
sophia
irritated
by
the
unrelieved
darkness
of
the
picture
drawn
by
madame
foucault
that
at
least
i
owe
you
a
considerable
sum
and
that
i
am
only
waiting
for
you
to
tell
me
how
much
it
is
i
have
asked
you
twice
already
i
think
oh
you
are
still
suffering
said
madame
foucault
i
am
quite
well
enough
to
pay
my
debts
said
sophia
i
do
not
like
to
accept
money
from
you
said
madame
foucault
but
why
not
you
will
have
the
doctor
to
pay
please
do
not
talk
in
that
way
said
sophia
i
have
money
and
i
can
pay
for
everything
and
i
shall
pay
for
everything
she
was
annoyed
because
she
was
sure
that
madame
foucault
was
only
making
a
pretence
of
delicacy
and
that
in
any
case
her
delicacy
was
preposterous
sophia
had
remarked
this
on
the
two
previous
occasions
when
she
had
mentioned
the
subject
of
bills
madame
foucault
would
not
treat
her
as
an
ordinary
lodger
now
that
the
illness
was
past
she
wanted
as
it
were
to
complete
brilliantly
what
she
had
begun
and
to
live
in
sophia
memory
as
a
unique
figure
of
lavish
philanthropy
this
was
a
sentiment
a
luxury
that
she
desired
to
offer
herself
the
thought
that
she
had
played
providence
to
a
respectable
married
lady
in
distress
she
frequently
hinted
at
sophia
misfortunes
and
helplessness
but
she
could
not
afford
the
luxury
she
gazed
at
it
as
a
poor
woman
gazes
at
costly
stuffs
through
the
glass
of
a
the
truth
was
she
wanted
the
luxury
for
nothing
for
a
double
reason
sophia
was
exasperated
by
madame
foucault
absurd
desire
and
by
a
natural
objection
to
the
role
of
a
subject
for
philanthropy
she
would
not
admit
that
madame
foucault
devotion
as
a
nurse
entitled
her
to
the
satisfaction
of
being
a
philanthropist
when
there
was
no
necessity
for
philanthropy
how
long
have
i
been
here
asked
sophia
i
do
know
murmured
madame
foucault
eight
weeks
or
is
it
nine
suppose
we
say
nine
said
sophia
very
well
agreed
madame
foucault
apparently
reluctant
now
how
much
must
i
pay
you
per
week
i
do
want
anything
i
do
want
anything
you
are
a
friend
of
chirac
you
not
at
all
sophia
interrupted
tapping
her
foot
and
biting
her
lip
naturally
i
must
pay
madame
foucault
wept
quietly
shall
i
pay
you
francs
a
week
said
sophia
anxious
to
end
the
matter
it
is
too
much
madame
foucault
protested
insincerely
what
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
i
speak
not
of
that
madame
foucault
modestly
replied
if
the
devotion
was
not
to
be
paid
for
then
francs
a
week
was
assuredly
too
much
as
during
more
than
half
the
time
sophia
had
had
almost
no
food
madame
foucault
was
therefore
within
the
truth
when
she
again
protested
at
sight
of
the
which
sophia
brought
from
her
trunk
i
am
sure
that
it
is
too
much
not
at
all
sophia
repeated
nine
weeks
at
that
makes
six
hundred
and
here
are
seven
hundreds
i
have
no
change
said
madame
foucault
i
have
nothing
that
will
pay
for
the
hire
of
the
bath
said
sophia
she
laid
the
notes
on
the
pillow
madame
foucault
looked
at
them
gluttonously
as
any
other
person
would
have
done
in
her
place
she
did
not
touch
them
after
an
instant
she
burst
into
wild
tears
but
why
do
you
cry
sophia
asked
softened
i
i
do
know
spluttered
madame
foucault
you
are
so
beautiful
i
am
so
content
that
we
saved
you
her
great
wet
eyes
rested
on
sophia
it
was
sentimentality
sophia
ruthlessly
set
it
down
as
sentimentality
but
she
was
touched
she
was
suddenly
moved
those
women
such
as
they
were
in
their
foolishness
probably
had
saved
her
life
and
she
a
stranger
flaccid
as
they
were
they
had
been
capable
of
resolute
perseverance
there
it
was
possible
to
say
that
chance
had
thrown
them
upon
an
enterprise
which
they
could
not
have
abandoned
till
they
or
death
had
won
it
was
possible
to
say
that
they
hoped
vaguely
to
derive
advantage
from
their
labours
but
even
then
judged
by
an
ordinary
standard
those
women
had
been
angels
of
mercy
and
sophia
was
despising
them
cruelly
taking
their
motives
to
pieces
accusing
them
of
incapacity
when
she
herself
stood
a
supreme
proof
of
their
capacity
in
at
any
rate
one
direction
in
a
rush
of
emotion
she
saw
her
hardness
and
her
injustice
she
bent
down
never
can
i
forget
how
kind
you
have
been
to
me
it
is
incredible
incredible
she
spoke
softly
in
tones
loaded
with
genuine
feeling
it
was
all
she
said
she
could
not
embroider
on
the
theme
she
had
no
talent
for
thanksgiving
madame
foucault
made
the
beginning
of
a
gesture
as
if
she
meant
to
kiss
sophia
with
those
thick
marred
lips
but
refrained
her
head
sank
back
and
then
she
had
a
recurrence
of
the
fit
of
nervous
sobbing
immediately
afterwards
there
was
the
sound
of
a
latchkey
in
the
of
the
flat
the
bedroom
door
was
open
still
sobbing
very
violently
she
cocked
her
ear
and
pushed
the
under
the
pillow
madame
laurence
as
she
was
called
sophia
had
never
heard
her
surname
came
straight
into
the
bedroom
and
beheld
the
scene
with
astonishment
in
her
dark
twinkling
eyes
she
was
usually
dressed
in
black
because
people
said
that
black
suited
her
and
because
black
was
never
out
of
fashion
black
was
an
expression
of
her
idiosyncrasy
she
showed
a
certain
elegance
and
by
comparison
with
the
extreme
disorder
of
madame
foucault
and
the
deshabille
of
sophia
her
appearance
all
fresh
from
a
modish
restaurant
was
brilliant
it
gave
her
an
advantage
over
the
other
two
that
moral
advantage
which
ceremonial
raiment
always
gives
what
is
it
that
passes
she
demanded
he
has
chucked
me
laurence
exclaimed
madame
foucault
in
a
sort
of
hysteric
scream
which
seemed
to
force
its
way
through
her
sobs
from
the
extraordinary
freshness
of
madame
foucault
woe
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
her
young
man
had
only
that
instant
strode
out
laurence
and
sophia
exchanged
a
swift
glance
and
laurence
of
course
perceived
that
sophia
relations
with
her
landlady
and
nurse
were
now
of
a
different
a
more
candid
order
she
indicated
her
perception
of
the
change
by
a
single
slight
movement
of
the
eyebrows
but
listen
aimee
she
said
authoritatively
you
must
not
let
yourself
go
like
that
he
will
return
never
cried
madame
foucault
it
is
finished
and
he
is
the
last
laurence
ignoring
madame
foucault
approached
sophia
you
have
an
air
very
fatigued
she
said
caressing
sophia
shoulder
with
her
gloved
hand
you
are
pale
like
everything
all
this
is
not
for
you
it
is
not
reasonable
to
remain
here
you
still
suffering
at
this
hour
truly
not
reasonable
her
hands
persuaded
sophia
towards
the
corridor
and
in
fact
sophia
did
then
notice
her
own
exhaustion
she
departed
from
the
room
with
the
ready
obedience
of
physical
weakness
and
shut
her
door
after
about
half
an
hour
during
which
she
heard
confused
noises
and
murmurings
her
door
half
opened
may
i
enter
since
you
are
not
asleep
it
was
laurence
voice
twice
now
she
had
addressed
sophia
without
adding
the
formal
enter
i
beg
you
sophia
called
from
the
bed
i
am
reading
laurence
came
in
sophia
was
both
glad
and
sorry
to
see
her
she
was
eager
to
hear
gossip
which
however
she
felt
she
ought
to
despise
moreover
she
knew
that
if
they
talked
that
night
they
would
talk
as
friends
and
that
laurence
would
ever
afterwards
treat
her
with
the
familiarity
of
a
friend
this
she
dreaded
still
she
knew
that
she
would
yield
at
any
rate
to
the
temptation
to
listen
to
gossip
i
have
put
her
to
bed
said
laurence
in
a
whisper
as
she
cautiously
closed
the
door
the
poor
woman
oh
what
a
charming
bracelet
it
is
a
true
pearl
naturally
her
roving
eye
had
immediately
with
an
infallible
instinct
caught
sight
of
a
bracelet
which
in
taking
stock
of
her
possessions
sophia
had
accidentally
left
on
the
piano
she
picked
it
up
and
then
put
it
down
again
yes
said
sophia
she
was
about
to
add
it
nearly
all
the
jewellery
i
possess
but
she
stopped
laurence
moved
towards
sophia
bed
and
stood
over
it
as
she
had
often
done
in
her
quality
as
nurse
she
had
taken
off
her
gloves
and
she
made
a
piquant
pretty
show
with
her
thirty
years
and
her
agreeable
slightly
roguish
face
in
which
were
mingled
the
knowingness
of
a
street
boy
and
the
confidence
of
a
woman
who
has
ceased
to
be
surprised
at
the
influence
of
her
snub
nose
on
a
highly
intelligent
man
did
she
tell
you
what
they
had
quarrelled
about
laurence
inquired
abruptly
and
not
only
the
phrasing
of
the
question
but
the
assured
tone
in
which
it
was
uttered
showed
that
laurence
meant
to
be
the
familiar
of
sophia
not
a
word
said
sophia
in
this
brief
question
and
reply
all
was
crudely
implied
that
had
previously
been
supposed
not
to
exist
the
relations
between
the
two
women
were
altered
irretrievably
in
a
moment
it
must
have
been
her
fault
said
laurence
with
men
she
is
insupportable
i
have
never
understood
how
that
poor
woman
has
made
her
way
with
women
she
is
charming
but
she
seems
to
be
incapable
of
not
treating
men
like
dogs
some
men
adore
that
but
they
are
few
is
it
not
sophia
smiled
i
have
told
her
how
many
times
have
i
told
her
but
it
is
useless
it
is
stronger
than
she
is
and
if
she
finishes
on
straw
one
will
be
able
to
say
that
it
was
because
of
that
but
truly
she
ought
not
to
have
asked
him
here
truly
that
was
too
much
if
he
knew
why
not
asked
sophia
awkwardly
the
answer
startled
her
because
her
room
has
not
been
disinfected
but
i
thought
all
the
flat
had
been
disinfected
all
except
her
room
but
why
not
her
room
laurence
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
did
not
want
to
disturb
her
things
is
it
that
i
know
i
she
is
like
that
she
takes
an
idea
and
then
there
you
are
she
told
me
every
room
had
been
disinfected
she
told
the
same
to
the
police
and
the
doctor
then
all
the
disinfection
is
useless
perfectly
but
she
is
like
that
this
flat
might
be
very
remunerative
but
with
her
never
she
has
not
even
paid
for
the
furniture
after
two
years
but
what
will
become
of
her
sophia
asked
ah
that
another
shrug
of
the
shoulders
all
that
i
know
is
that
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
leave
here
the
last
time
i
brought
monsieur
cerf
here
she
was
excessively
rude
to
him
she
has
doubtless
told
you
about
monsieur
cerf
no
who
is
monsieur
cerf
ah
she
has
not
told
you
that
astonishes
me
monsieur
cerf
that
is
my
friend
you
know
oh
murmured
sophia
yes
laurence
proceeded
impelled
by
a
desire
to
impress
sophia
and
to
gossip
at
large
that
is
my
friend
i
knew
him
at
the
hospital
it
was
to
please
him
that
i
left
the
hospital
after
that
we
quarrelled
for
two
years
but
at
the
end
he
gave
me
right
i
did
not
budge
two
years
it
is
long
and
i
had
left
the
hospital
i
could
have
gone
back
but
i
would
not
that
is
not
a
life
to
be
nurse
in
a
paris
hospital
no
i
drew
myself
out
as
well
as
i
could
he
is
the
most
charming
boy
you
can
imagine
and
rich
now
that
is
to
say
relatively
he
has
a
cousin
infinitely
more
rich
than
he
i
dined
with
them
both
at
the
maison
doree
for
a
luxurious
boy
he
is
a
luxurious
boy
the
cousin
i
mean
it
appears
that
he
has
made
a
fortune
in
canada
truly
said
sophia
with
politeness
laurence
hand
was
playing
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
sophia
observed
for
the
first
time
that
it
bore
a
you
remark
my
ring
laurence
laughed
that
is
he
the
cousin
he
said
do
not
wear
an
alliance
an
alliance
is
more
proper
we
are
going
to
arrange
that
after
dinner
i
said
that
all
the
jewellers
shops
would
be
closed
is
all
the
same
to
me
he
said
will
open
one
and
in
effect
it
passed
like
that
he
succeeded
is
it
not
beautiful
she
held
forth
her
hand
yes
said
sophia
it
is
very
beautiful
yours
also
is
beautiful
said
laurence
with
an
extremely
puzzling
intonation
it
is
just
the
ordinary
english
said
sophia
in
spite
of
herself
she
blushed
now
i
have
married
you
it
is
i
the
cure
said
he
the
cousin
when
he
put
the
ring
on
my
finger
oh
he
is
excessively
amusing
he
pleases
me
much
and
he
is
all
alone
he
asked
me
whether
i
knew
among
my
friends
a
sympathetic
pretty
girl
to
make
four
with
us
three
for
a
picnic
i
said
i
was
not
sure
but
i
thought
not
whom
do
i
know
nobody
i
not
a
woman
like
the
rest
i
am
always
discreet
i
do
not
like
casual
relations
but
he
is
very
well
the
cousin
brown
eyes
it
is
an
idea
will
you
come
one
day
he
speaks
english
he
loves
the
english
he
is
all
that
is
most
correct
the
perfect
gentleman
he
would
arrange
a
dazzling
fete
i
am
sure
he
would
be
enchanted
to
make
your
acquaintance
enchanted
as
for
my
charles
happily
he
is
completely
mad
about
me
otherwise
i
should
have
fear
she
smiled
and
in
her
smile
was
a
genuine
respect
for
sophia
face
i
fear
i
can
not
come
said
sophia
she
honestly
endeavoured
to
keep
out
of
her
reply
any
accent
of
moral
superiority
but
she
did
not
quite
succeed
she
was
not
at
all
horrified
by
laurence
suggestion
she
meant
simply
to
refuse
it
but
she
could
not
do
so
in
a
natural
voice
it
is
true
you
are
not
yet
strong
enough
said
the
imperturbable
laurence
quickly
and
with
a
perfect
imitation
of
naturalness
but
soon
you
must
make
a
little
promenade
she
stared
at
her
ring
after
all
it
is
more
proper
she
observed
judicially
with
a
one
is
less
likely
to
be
annoyed
what
is
curious
is
that
the
idea
never
before
came
to
me
yet
you
like
jewellery
said
sophia
if
i
like
jewellery
with
a
gesture
of
the
hands
will
you
pass
me
that
bracelet
laurence
obeyed
and
sophia
clasped
it
round
the
girl
wrist
keep
it
sophia
said
for
me
laurence
exclaimed
ravished
it
is
too
much
it
is
not
enough
said
sophia
and
when
you
look
at
it
you
must
remember
how
kind
you
were
to
me
and
how
grateful
i
am
how
nicely
you
say
that
laurence
said
ecstatically
and
sophia
felt
that
she
had
indeed
said
it
rather
nicely
this
giving
of
the
bracelet
souvenir
of
one
of
the
few
capricious
follies
that
gerald
had
committed
for
her
and
not
for
himself
pleased
sophia
very
much
i
am
afraid
your
nursing
of
me
forced
you
to
neglect
monsieur
cerf
she
added
yes
a
little
said
laurence
impartially
with
a
small
pout
of
haughtiness
it
is
true
that
he
used
to
complain
but
i
soon
put
him
straight
what
an
idea
he
knows
there
are
things
upon
which
i
do
not
joke
it
is
not
he
who
will
quarrel
a
second
time
believe
me
laurence
absolute
conviction
of
her
power
was
what
impressed
sophia
to
sophia
she
seemed
to
be
a
vulgar
little
piece
of
goods
with
dubious
charm
and
a
glance
that
was
far
too
brazen
her
movements
were
vulgar
and
sophia
wondered
how
she
had
established
her
empire
and
upon
what
it
rested
i
shall
not
show
this
to
aimee
whispered
laurence
indicating
the
bracelet
as
you
wish
said
sophia
by
the
way
have
i
told
you
that
war
is
declared
laurence
casually
remarked
no
said
sophia
what
war
the
scene
with
aimee
made
me
forget
it
with
germany
the
city
is
quite
excited
an
immense
crowd
in
front
of
the
new
opera
they
say
we
shall
be
at
berlin
in
a
month
or
at
most
two
months
oh
sophia
muttered
why
is
there
a
war
ah
it
is
i
who
asked
that
nobody
knows
it
is
those
prussians
do
you
think
we
ought
to
begin
again
with
the
disinfecting
sophia
asked
anxiously
i
must
speak
to
madame
foucault
laurence
told
her
not
to
worry
and
went
off
to
show
the
bracelet
to
madame
foucault
she
had
privately
decided
that
this
was
a
pleasure
which
after
all
she
could
not
deny
herself
iv
about
a
fortnight
later
it
was
a
fine
saturday
in
early
august
sophia
with
a
large
pinafore
over
her
dress
was
finishing
the
portentous
preparations
for
disinfecting
the
flat
part
of
the
affair
was
already
accomplished
her
own
room
and
the
corridor
having
been
fumigated
on
the
previous
day
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
madame
foucault
who
had
taken
amiss
laurence
to
sophia
laurence
had
left
the
flat
under
exactly
what
circumstances
sophia
knew
not
but
she
guessed
that
it
must
have
been
in
consequence
of
a
scene
elaborating
the
tiff
caused
by
madame
foucault
resentment
against
laurence
the
brief
factitious
friendliness
between
laurence
and
sophia
had
gone
like
a
dream
and
laurence
had
gone
like
a
dream
the
servant
had
been
dismissed
in
her
place
madame
foucault
employed
a
charwoman
each
morning
for
two
hours
finally
madame
foucault
had
been
suddenly
called
away
that
morning
by
a
letter
to
her
sick
father
at
sophia
was
delighted
at
the
chance
the
disinfecting
of
the
flat
had
become
an
obsession
with
sophia
the
obsession
of
a
convalescent
whose
perspective
unconsciously
twists
things
to
the
most
wry
shapes
she
had
had
trouble
on
the
day
before
with
madame
foucault
and
she
was
expecting
more
serious
trouble
when
the
moment
arrived
for
ejecting
madame
foucault
as
well
as
all
her
movable
belongings
from
madame
foucault
own
room
nevertheless
sophia
had
been
determined
whatever
should
happen
to
complete
an
honest
fumigation
of
the
entire
flat
hence
the
eagerness
with
which
urging
madame
foucault
to
go
to
her
father
sophia
had
protested
that
she
was
perfectly
strong
and
could
manage
by
herself
for
a
couple
of
days
owing
to
the
partial
suppression
of
the
ordinary
railway
services
in
favour
of
military
needs
madame
foucault
could
not
hope
to
go
and
return
on
the
same
day
sophia
had
lent
her
a
louis
pans
of
sulphur
were
mysteriously
burning
in
each
of
the
three
front
rooms
and
two
pairs
of
doors
had
been
pasted
over
with
paper
to
prevent
the
fumes
from
escaping
the
charwoman
had
departed
sophia
with
brush
scissors
and
was
sealing
the
third
pair
of
doors
when
there
was
a
ring
at
the
front
door
she
had
only
to
cross
the
corridor
in
order
to
open
it
was
chirac
she
was
not
surprised
to
see
him
the
outbreak
of
the
war
had
induced
even
sophia
and
her
landlady
to
look
through
at
least
one
newspaper
during
the
day
and
she
had
in
this
way
learnt
from
an
article
signed
by
chirac
that
he
had
returned
to
paris
after
a
mission
into
the
vosges
country
for
his
paper
he
started
on
seeing
her
ah
he
breathed
out
the
exclamation
slowly
and
then
smiled
seized
her
hand
and
kissed
it
the
sight
of
his
obvious
extreme
pleasure
in
meeting
her
again
was
the
sweetest
experience
that
had
fallen
to
sophia
for
years
then
you
are
cured
quite
he
sighed
you
know
this
is
an
enormous
relief
to
me
to
know
veritably
that
you
are
no
longer
in
danger
you
gave
me
a
fright
but
a
fright
my
dear
madame
she
smiled
in
silence
as
he
glanced
inquiringly
up
and
down
the
corridor
she
said
i
all
alone
in
the
flat
i
disinfecting
it
then
that
is
sulphur
that
i
smell
she
nodded
excuse
me
while
i
finish
this
door
she
said
he
closed
the
but
you
seem
to
be
quite
at
home
here
he
observed
i
ought
to
be
said
she
he
glanced
again
inquiringly
up
and
down
the
corridor
and
you
are
really
all
alone
now
he
asked
as
though
to
be
doubly
sure
she
explained
the
circumstances
i
owe
you
my
most
sincere
excuses
for
bringing
you
here
he
said
confidentially
but
why
she
replied
looking
intently
at
her
door
they
have
been
most
kind
to
me
nobody
could
have
been
kinder
and
madame
laurence
being
such
a
good
nurse
it
is
true
said
he
that
was
a
reason
in
effect
they
are
both
very
little
women
you
comprehend
as
journalist
it
arrives
to
me
to
know
all
kinds
of
people
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
as
we
were
opposite
the
house
in
fine
i
pray
you
to
excuse
me
hold
me
this
paper
she
said
it
is
necessary
that
every
crack
should
be
covered
also
between
the
floor
and
the
door
you
english
are
wonderful
he
murmured
as
he
took
the
paper
imagine
you
doing
that
then
he
added
resuming
the
confidential
tone
i
suppose
you
will
leave
the
foucault
now
hein
i
suppose
so
she
said
carelessly
you
go
to
england
she
turned
to
him
as
she
patted
the
creases
out
of
a
strip
of
paper
with
a
duster
and
shook
her
head
not
to
england
no
if
it
is
not
indiscreet
where
are
you
going
i
do
know
she
said
candidly
and
she
did
not
know
she
was
without
a
plan
her
brain
told
her
that
she
ought
to
return
to
bursley
or
at
the
least
write
but
her
pride
would
not
hear
of
such
a
surrender
her
situation
would
have
to
be
far
more
desperate
than
it
was
before
she
could
confess
her
defeat
to
her
family
even
in
a
letter
a
thousand
times
no
that
was
a
point
which
she
had
for
ever
decided
she
would
face
any
disaster
and
any
other
shame
rather
than
the
shame
of
her
family
forgiving
reception
of
her
and
you
she
asked
how
does
it
go
this
war
he
told
her
in
a
few
words
a
few
leading
facts
about
himself
it
must
not
be
said
he
added
of
the
war
but
that
will
turn
out
ill
i
i
know
you
comprehend
truly
she
answered
with
casualness
you
have
heard
nothing
of
him
chirac
asked
who
gerald
he
gave
a
gesture
nothing
not
a
word
nothing
he
will
have
gone
back
to
england
never
she
said
positively
but
why
not
because
he
prefers
france
he
really
does
like
france
i
think
it
is
the
only
real
passion
he
ever
had
it
is
astonishing
reflected
chirac
how
france
is
loved
and
yet
but
to
live
what
will
he
do
must
live
sophia
merely
shrugged
her
shoulders
then
it
is
finished
between
you
two
he
muttered
awkwardly
she
nodded
she
was
on
her
knees
at
the
lower
crack
of
the
doors
there
she
said
rising
it
well
done
is
it
that
is
all
she
smiled
at
him
facing
him
squarely
in
the
obscurity
of
the
untidy
and
shabby
corridor
both
felt
that
they
had
become
very
intimate
he
was
intensely
flattered
by
her
attitude
and
she
knew
it
now
she
said
i
will
take
off
my
pinafore
where
can
i
niche
you
there
is
only
my
bedroom
and
i
want
that
what
are
we
to
do
listen
he
suggested
diffidently
will
you
do
me
the
honour
to
come
for
a
drive
that
will
do
you
good
there
is
sunshine
and
you
are
always
very
pale
with
pleasure
she
agreed
cordially
while
dressing
she
heard
him
walking
up
and
down
the
corridor
occasionally
they
exchanged
a
few
words
before
leaving
sophia
pulled
off
the
paper
from
one
of
the
of
the
sealed
suite
of
rooms
and
they
peered
through
one
after
the
other
and
saw
the
green
glow
of
the
sulphur
and
were
troubled
by
its
uncanniness
and
then
sophia
refixed
the
paper
in
descending
the
stairs
of
the
house
she
felt
the
infirmity
of
her
knees
but
in
other
respects
though
she
had
been
out
only
once
before
since
her
illness
she
was
conscious
of
a
sufficient
strength
a
disinclination
for
any
enterprise
had
prevented
her
from
taking
the
air
as
she
ought
to
have
done
but
within
the
flat
she
had
exercised
her
limbs
in
many
small
tasks
the
little
chirac
nervously
active
and
restless
wanted
to
take
her
arm
but
she
would
not
allow
it
the
concierge
and
part
of
her
family
stared
curiously
at
sophia
as
she
passed
under
the
archway
for
the
course
of
her
illness
had
excited
the
interest
of
the
whole
house
just
as
the
carriage
was
driving
off
the
concierge
came
across
the
pavement
and
paid
her
compliments
and
then
said
you
do
not
know
by
hazard
why
madame
foucault
has
not
returned
for
lunch
madame
returned
for
lunch
said
sophia
she
will
not
come
back
till
the
concierge
made
a
face
ah
how
curious
it
is
she
told
my
husband
that
she
would
return
in
two
hours
it
is
very
grave
question
of
business
i
know
nothing
madame
said
sophia
she
and
chirac
looked
at
each
other
the
concierge
murmured
thanks
and
went
off
muttering
indistinctly
the
fiacre
turned
down
the
rue
laferriere
the
horse
slipping
and
sliding
as
usual
over
the
cobblestones
soon
they
were
on
the
boulevard
making
for
the
champs
elysees
and
the
bois
de
boulogne
the
fresh
breeze
and
bright
sunshine
and
the
large
freedom
of
the
streets
quickly
intoxicated
sophia
intoxicated
her
that
is
to
say
in
quite
a
physical
sense
she
was
almost
drunk
with
the
heady
savour
of
life
itself
a
mild
ecstasy
of
overcame
her
she
saw
the
flat
as
a
horrible
vile
prison
and
blamed
herself
for
not
leaving
it
sooner
and
oftener
the
air
was
medicine
for
body
and
mind
too
her
perspective
was
instantly
corrected
she
was
happy
living
neither
in
the
past
nor
in
the
future
but
in
and
for
that
hour
and
beneath
her
happiness
moved
a
wistful
melancholy
for
the
sophia
who
had
suffered
such
a
captivity
and
such
woes
she
yearned
for
more
and
yet
more
delight
for
careless
orgies
of
passionate
pleasure
in
the
midst
of
which
she
would
forget
all
trouble
why
had
she
refused
the
offer
of
laurence
why
had
she
not
rushed
at
once
into
the
splendid
fire
of
joyous
indulgence
ignoring
everything
but
the
crude
sensuous
instinct
acutely
aware
as
she
was
of
her
youth
her
beauty
and
her
charm
she
wondered
at
her
refusal
she
did
not
regret
her
refusal
she
placidly
observed
it
as
the
result
of
some
tremendously
powerful
motive
in
herself
which
could
not
be
questioned
or
reasoned
with
which
was
in
fact
the
essential
her
do
i
look
like
an
invalid
she
asked
leaning
back
luxuriously
in
the
carriage
among
the
crowd
of
other
vehicles
chirac
hesitated
my
faith
yes
he
said
at
length
but
it
becomes
you
if
i
did
not
know
that
you
have
little
love
for
compliments
i
but
i
adore
compliments
she
exclaimed
what
made
you
think
that
well
then
he
youthfully
burst
out
you
are
more
ravishing
than
ever
she
gave
herself
up
deliciously
to
his
admiration
after
a
silence
he
said
ah
if
you
knew
how
disquieted
i
was
about
you
away
there
i
should
not
know
how
to
tell
you
veritably
disquieted
you
comprehend
what
could
i
do
tell
me
a
little
about
your
illness
she
recounted
details
as
the
fiacre
entered
the
rue
royale
they
noticed
a
crowd
of
people
in
front
of
the
madeleine
shouting
and
cheering
the
cabman
turned
towards
them
it
appears
there
has
been
a
victory
he
said
a
victory
if
only
it
was
true
murmured
chirac
cynically
in
the
rue
royale
people
were
running
frantically
to
and
fro
laughing
and
gesticulating
in
glee
the
customers
in
the
cafes
stood
on
their
chairs
and
even
on
tables
to
watch
and
occasionally
to
join
in
the
sudden
fever
the
fiacre
was
slowed
to
a
walking
pace
flags
and
carpets
began
to
show
from
the
upper
storeys
of
houses
the
crowd
grew
thicker
and
more
febrile
victory
victory
rang
hoarsely
shrilly
and
hoarsely
again
in
the
air
my
god
said
chirac
trembling
it
must
be
a
true
victory
we
are
saved
we
are
saved
oh
yes
it
is
true
but
naturally
it
is
true
what
are
you
saying
demanded
the
driver
at
the
place
de
la
concorde
the
fiacre
had
to
stop
altogether
the
immense
square
was
a
sea
of
white
hats
and
flowers
and
happy
faces
with
carriages
anchored
like
boats
on
its
surface
flag
after
flag
waved
out
from
neighbouring
roofs
in
the
breeze
that
tempered
the
august
sun
then
hats
began
to
go
up
and
cheers
rolled
across
the
square
like
echoes
of
firing
in
an
enclosed
valley
chirac
driver
jumped
madly
on
to
his
seat
and
cracked
his
whip
vive
la
france
he
bawled
with
all
the
force
of
his
lungs
a
thousand
throats
answered
him
then
there
was
a
stir
behind
them
another
carriage
was
being
slowly
forced
to
the
front
the
crowd
was
pushing
it
and
crying
marseillaise
marseillaise
in
the
carriage
was
a
woman
alone
not
beautiful
but
distinguished
and
with
the
assured
gaze
of
one
who
is
accustomed
to
homage
and
multitudinous
applause
it
is
gueymard
said
chirac
to
sophia
he
was
very
pale
and
he
too
shouted
marseillaise
all
his
features
were
distorted
the
woman
rose
and
spoke
to
her
coachman
who
offered
his
hand
and
she
climbed
to
the
box
seat
and
stood
on
it
and
bowed
several
times
marseillaise
the
cry
continued
then
a
roar
of
cheers
and
then
silence
spread
round
the
square
like
an
inundation
and
amid
this
silence
the
woman
began
to
sing
the
marseillaise
as
she
sang
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
everybody
in
the
vicinity
was
weeping
or
sternly
frowning
in
the
pauses
of
the
first
verse
could
be
heard
the
rattle
of
horses
bits
or
a
whistle
of
a
tug
on
the
river
the
refrain
signalled
by
a
proud
challenging
toss
of
gueymard
head
leapt
up
like
a
tropical
tempest
formidable
overpowering
sophia
who
had
had
no
warning
of
the
emotion
gathering
within
her
sobbed
violently
at
the
close
of
the
hymn
gueymard
carriage
was
assaulted
by
worshippers
all
around
in
the
tumult
of
shouting
men
were
kissing
and
embracing
each
other
and
hats
went
up
continually
in
fountains
chirac
leaned
over
the
side
of
the
carriage
and
wrung
the
hand
of
a
man
who
was
standing
by
the
wheel
who
is
that
sophia
asked
in
an
unsteady
voice
to
break
the
inexplicable
tension
within
her
i
do
know
said
chirac
he
was
weeping
like
a
child
and
he
sang
out
victory
to
berlin
victory
v
sophia
walked
alone
with
tired
limbs
up
the
damaged
oak
stairs
to
the
flat
chirac
had
decided
that
in
the
circumstances
of
the
victory
he
would
do
well
to
go
to
the
offices
of
his
paper
rather
earlier
than
usual
he
had
brought
her
back
to
the
rue
breda
they
had
taken
leave
of
each
other
in
a
sort
of
dream
or
general
enchantment
due
to
their
participation
in
the
vast
national
delirium
which
somehow
dominated
individual
feelings
they
did
not
define
their
relations
they
had
been
conscious
only
of
emotion
the
stairs
which
smelt
of
damp
even
in
summer
disgusted
sophia
she
thought
of
the
flat
with
horror
and
longed
for
green
places
and
luxury
on
the
landing
were
two
stoutish
men
of
middle
age
apparently
waiting
sophia
found
her
key
and
opened
the
door
pardon
madame
said
one
of
the
men
raising
his
hat
and
they
both
pushed
into
the
flat
after
her
they
stared
puzzled
at
the
strips
of
paper
pasted
on
the
doors
what
do
you
want
she
asked
haughtily
she
was
very
frightened
the
extraordinary
interruption
brought
her
down
with
a
shock
to
the
scale
of
the
individual
i
am
the
concierge
said
the
man
who
had
addressed
her
he
had
the
air
of
a
superior
artisan
it
was
my
wife
who
spoke
to
you
this
afternoon
this
pointing
to
his
companion
this
is
the
law
i
regret
it
but
the
law
saluted
and
shut
the
front
door
like
the
concierge
the
law
emitted
an
odour
the
odour
of
uncleanliness
on
a
hot
august
day
the
rent
exclaimed
sophia
no
madame
not
the
rent
the
furniture
then
she
learnt
the
history
of
the
furniture
it
had
belonged
to
the
concierge
who
had
acquired
it
from
a
previous
tenant
and
sold
it
on
credit
to
madame
foucault
madame
foucault
had
signed
bills
and
had
not
met
them
she
had
made
promises
and
broken
them
she
had
done
everything
except
discharge
her
liabilities
she
had
been
warned
and
warned
again
that
day
had
been
fixed
as
the
last
limit
and
she
had
solemnly
assured
her
creditor
that
on
that
day
she
would
pay
on
leaving
the
house
she
had
stated
precisely
and
clearly
that
she
would
return
before
lunch
with
all
the
money
she
had
made
no
mention
of
a
sick
father
sophia
slowly
perceived
the
extent
of
madame
foucault
duplicity
and
moral
cowardice
no
doubt
the
sick
father
was
an
invention
the
woman
at
the
end
of
a
tether
which
no
ingenuity
of
lies
could
further
lengthen
had
probably
absented
herself
solely
to
avoid
the
pain
of
witnessing
the
seizure
she
would
do
anything
however
silly
to
avoid
an
immediate
unpleasantness
or
perhaps
she
had
absented
herself
without
any
particular
aim
but
simply
in
the
hope
that
something
fortunate
might
occur
perhaps
she
had
hoped
that
sophia
taken
unawares
would
generously
pay
sophia
smiled
grimly
well
she
said
i
ca
do
anything
i
suppose
you
must
do
what
you
have
to
do
you
will
let
me
pack
up
my
own
affairs
perfectly
madame
she
warned
them
as
to
the
danger
of
opening
the
sealed
rooms
the
man
of
the
law
seemed
prepared
to
stay
in
the
corridor
indefinitely
no
prospect
of
delay
disturbed
him
strange
and
disturbing
the
triumph
of
the
concierge
he
was
a
locksmith
by
trade
he
and
his
wife
and
their
children
lived
in
two
little
dark
rooms
by
the
archway
an
insignificant
fragment
of
the
house
he
was
away
from
home
about
fourteen
hours
every
day
except
sundays
when
he
washed
the
courtyard
all
the
other
duties
of
the
concierge
were
performed
by
the
wife
the
pair
always
looked
poor
untidy
dirty
and
rather
forlorn
but
they
were
steadily
levying
toll
on
everybody
in
the
big
house
they
amassed
money
in
forty
ways
they
lived
for
money
and
all
men
have
what
they
live
for
with
what
arrogant
gestures
madame
foucault
would
descend
from
a
carriage
at
the
great
door
what
respectful
attitudes
and
tones
the
ageing
courtesan
would
receive
from
the
wife
and
children
of
the
concierge
but
beneath
these
conventional
fictions
the
truth
was
that
the
concierge
held
the
whip
at
last
he
was
using
it
and
he
had
given
himself
a
in
order
to
celebrate
his
second
acquirement
of
the
ostentatious
furniture
and
the
crimson
lampshades
this
was
one
of
the
dramatic
crises
in
his
career
as
a
man
of
substance
the
national
thrill
of
victory
had
not
penetrated
into
the
flat
with
the
concierge
and
the
law
the
emotions
of
the
concierge
were
entirely
independent
of
the
napoleonic
foreign
policy
as
sophia
sick
with
a
sudden
disillusion
was
putting
her
things
together
and
wondering
where
she
was
to
go
and
whether
it
would
be
politic
to
consult
chirac
she
heard
a
fluster
at
the
front
door
cries
protestations
implorings
her
own
door
was
thrust
open
and
madame
foucault
burst
in
save
me
exclaimed
madame
foucault
sinking
to
the
ground
the
feeble
theatricality
of
the
gesture
offended
sophia
taste
she
asked
sternly
what
madame
foucault
expected
her
to
do
had
not
madame
foucault
knowingly
exposed
her
without
the
least
warning
to
the
extreme
annoyance
of
this
visit
of
the
law
a
visit
which
meant
practically
that
sophia
was
put
into
the
street
you
must
not
be
hard
madame
foucault
sobbed
sophia
learnt
the
complete
history
of
the
woman
efforts
to
pay
for
the
furniture
a
farrago
of
folly
and
deceptions
madame
foucault
confessed
too
much
sophia
scorned
confession
for
the
sake
of
confession
she
scorned
the
impulse
which
forces
a
weak
creature
to
insist
on
its
weakness
to
revel
in
remorse
and
to
find
an
excuse
for
its
conduct
in
the
very
fact
that
there
is
no
excuse
she
gathered
that
madame
foucault
had
in
fact
gone
away
in
the
hope
that
sophia
trapped
would
pay
and
that
in
the
end
she
had
not
even
had
the
courage
of
her
own
trickery
and
had
run
back
driven
by
panic
into
audacity
to
fall
at
sophia
feet
lest
sophia
might
not
have
yielded
and
the
furniture
have
been
seized
from
beginning
to
end
the
conduct
of
madame
foucault
had
been
fatuous
and
despicable
and
wicked
sophia
coldly
condemned
madame
foucault
for
having
allowed
herself
to
be
brought
into
the
world
with
such
a
weak
and
maudlin
character
and
for
having
allowed
herself
to
grow
old
and
ugly
as
a
sight
the
woman
was
positively
disgraceful
save
me
she
exclaimed
again
i
did
what
i
could
for
you
sophia
hated
her
but
the
logic
of
the
appeal
was
irresistible
but
what
can
i
do
she
asked
reluctantly
lend
me
the
money
you
can
if
you
do
this
will
be
the
end
for
me
and
a
good
thing
too
thought
sophia
hard
sense
how
much
is
it
sophia
glumly
asked
it
is
a
thousand
francs
said
madame
foucault
with
eagerness
all
my
beautiful
furniture
will
go
for
less
than
a
thousand
francs
save
me
she
was
nauseating
sophia
please
rise
said
sophia
her
hands
fidgeting
undecidedly
i
shall
repay
you
surely
madame
foucault
asseverated
i
swear
does
she
take
me
for
a
fool
thought
sophia
with
her
oaths
no
said
sophia
i
wo
lend
you
the
money
but
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
buy
the
furniture
at
that
price
and
i
will
promise
to
it
to
you
as
soon
as
you
can
pay
me
like
that
you
can
be
tranquil
but
i
have
very
little
money
i
must
have
a
guarantee
the
furniture
must
be
mine
till
you
pay
me
you
are
an
angel
of
charity
cried
madame
foucault
embracing
sophia
skirts
i
will
do
whatever
you
wish
ah
you
englishwomen
are
astonishing
sophia
was
not
an
angel
of
charity
what
she
had
promised
to
do
involved
sacrifice
and
anxiety
without
the
prospect
of
reward
but
it
was
not
charity
it
was
part
of
the
price
sophia
paid
for
the
exercise
of
her
logical
faculty
she
paid
it
unwillingly
did
what
i
could
for
you
sophia
would
have
died
sooner
than
remind
any
one
of
a
benefit
conferred
and
madame
foucault
had
committed
precisely
that
enormity
the
appeal
was
inexcusable
to
a
fine
mind
but
it
was
effective
the
men
were
behind
the
door
listening
sophia
paid
out
of
her
stock
of
notes
needless
to
say
the
total
was
more
and
not
less
than
a
thousand
francs
madame
foucault
grew
rapidly
confidential
with
the
man
without
consulting
sophia
she
asked
the
bailiff
to
draw
up
a
receipt
transferring
the
ownership
of
all
the
furniture
to
sophia
and
the
bailiff
struck
into
obligingness
by
glimpses
of
sophia
beauty
consented
to
do
so
there
was
much
conferring
upon
forms
of
words
and
flourishing
of
pens
between
thick
vile
fingers
and
scattering
of
ink
before
the
men
left
madame
foucault
uncorked
a
bottle
of
wine
for
them
and
helped
them
to
drink
it
throughout
the
evening
she
was
insupportably
deferential
to
sophia
who
was
driven
to
bed
madame
foucault
contentedly
went
up
to
the
sixth
floor
to
occupy
the
bedroom
she
was
glad
to
get
so
far
away
from
the
sulphur
of
which
a
few
faint
fumes
had
penetrated
into
the
corridor
the
next
morning
after
a
stifling
night
of
bad
dreams
sophia
was
too
ill
to
get
up
she
looked
round
at
the
furniture
in
the
little
room
and
she
imagined
the
furniture
in
the
other
rooms
and
dismally
thought
all
this
furniture
is
mine
she
will
never
pay
me
i
am
saddled
with
it
it
was
cheaply
bought
but
she
probably
could
not
sell
it
for
even
what
she
had
paid
still
the
sense
of
ownership
was
reassuring
the
charwoman
brought
her
coffee
and
chirac
newspaper
from
which
she
learnt
that
the
news
of
the
victory
which
had
sent
the
city
mad
on
the
previous
day
was
utterly
false
tears
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
gazed
absently
at
all
the
curtained
windows
of
the
courtyard
she
had
youth
and
loveliness
according
to
the
rules
she
ought
to
have
been
irresponsible
gay
and
indulgently
watched
over
by
the
wisdom
of
admiring
age
but
she
felt
towards
the
french
nation
as
a
mother
might
feel
towards
adorable
wilful
children
suffering
through
their
own
charming
foolishness
she
saw
france
personified
in
chirac
how
easily
despite
his
special
knowledge
he
had
yielded
to
the
fever
her
heart
bled
for
france
and
chirac
on
that
morning
of
reaction
and
of
truth
she
could
not
bear
to
recall
the
scene
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
madame
foucault
had
not
descended
chapter
vi
the
siege
i
madame
foucault
came
into
sophia
room
one
afternoon
with
a
peculiar
guilty
expression
on
her
large
face
and
she
held
her
peignoir
close
to
her
exuberant
body
in
folds
consciously
majestic
as
though
endeavouring
to
prove
to
sophia
by
her
carriage
that
despite
her
shifting
eyes
she
was
the
most
righteous
and
sincere
woman
that
ever
lived
it
was
saturday
the
third
of
september
a
beautiful
day
sophia
suffering
from
an
unimportant
relapse
had
remained
in
a
state
of
inactivity
and
had
scarcely
gone
out
at
all
she
loathed
the
flat
but
lacked
the
energy
to
leave
it
every
day
there
was
no
sufficiently
definite
object
in
leaving
it
she
could
not
go
out
and
look
for
health
as
she
might
have
looked
for
flowers
so
she
remained
in
the
flat
and
stared
at
the
courtyard
and
the
continual
mystery
of
lives
hidden
behind
curtains
that
occasionally
moved
and
the
painted
yellow
walls
of
the
house
and
the
papered
walls
of
her
room
pressed
upon
her
and
crushed
her
for
a
few
days
chirac
had
called
daily
animated
by
the
most
adorable
solicitude
then
he
had
ceased
to
call
she
had
tired
of
reading
the
journals
they
lay
unopened
the
relations
between
madame
foucault
and
herself
and
her
status
in
the
flat
of
which
she
now
legally
owned
the
furniture
these
things
were
left
unsettled
but
the
question
of
her
board
was
arranged
on
the
terms
that
she
halved
the
cost
of
food
and
service
with
madame
foucault
her
expenses
were
thus
reduced
to
the
lowest
possible
about
eighteen
francs
a
week
an
idea
hung
in
the
air
like
a
scientific
discovery
on
the
point
of
being
made
by
several
independent
investigators
simultaneously
that
she
and
madame
foucault
should
in
order
to
let
furnished
rooms
at
a
remunerative
profit
sophia
felt
the
nearness
of
the
idea
and
she
wanted
to
be
shocked
at
the
notion
of
any
avowed
association
between
herself
and
madame
foucault
but
she
could
not
be
here
are
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
who
want
a
bedroom
began
madame
foucault
a
nice
large
bedroom
furnished
oh
said
sophia
who
are
they
they
will
pay
a
hundred
and
thirty
francs
a
month
in
advance
for
the
middle
bedroom
you
shown
it
to
them
already
said
sophia
and
her
tone
implied
that
somehow
she
was
conscious
of
a
right
to
overlook
the
affair
of
madame
foucault
no
said
the
other
i
said
to
myself
that
first
i
would
ask
you
for
a
counsel
then
will
they
pay
all
that
for
a
room
they
have
seen
the
fact
is
said
madame
foucault
sheepishly
the
lady
has
seen
the
room
before
i
know
her
a
little
it
is
a
former
tenant
she
lived
here
some
weeks
in
that
room
oh
no
she
was
poor
enough
then
where
are
they
in
the
corridor
she
is
very
well
the
lady
naturally
one
must
live
she
like
all
the
world
but
she
is
veritably
well
quite
respectable
one
would
never
say
then
there
would
be
the
meals
we
could
demand
one
franc
for
the
cafe
au
lait
two
and
a
half
francs
for
the
lunch
and
three
francs
for
the
dinner
without
counting
other
things
that
would
mean
over
five
hundred
francs
a
month
at
least
and
what
would
they
cost
us
almost
nothing
by
what
appears
he
is
a
plutocrat
i
could
thus
quickly
repay
you
is
it
a
married
couple
ah
you
know
one
can
not
demand
the
marriage
certificate
madame
foucault
indicated
by
a
gesture
that
the
rue
breda
was
not
the
paradise
of
saints
when
she
came
before
this
lady
was
it
with
the
same
man
sophia
asked
coldly
ah
my
faith
no
exclaimed
madame
foucault
bridling
it
was
a
bad
sort
the
other
a
ah
no
why
do
you
ask
my
advice
sophia
abruptly
questioned
in
a
hard
inimical
voice
is
it
that
it
concerns
me
tears
came
at
once
into
the
eyes
of
madame
foucault
do
not
be
unkind
she
implored
i
not
unkind
said
sophia
in
the
same
tone
shall
you
leave
me
if
i
accept
this
offer
there
was
a
pause
yes
said
sophia
bluntly
she
tried
to
be
and
sympathetic
but
there
was
no
sign
of
these
qualities
in
her
speech
and
if
you
take
with
you
the
furniture
which
is
yours
sophia
kept
silence
how
am
i
to
live
i
demand
of
you
madame
foucault
asked
weakly
by
being
respectable
and
dealing
with
respectable
people
said
sophia
uncompromisingly
in
tones
of
steel
i
am
unhappy
murmured
the
elder
woman
however
you
are
more
strong
than
i
she
brusquely
dabbed
her
eyes
gave
a
little
sob
and
ran
out
of
the
room
sophia
listened
at
the
door
and
heard
her
dismiss
the
tenants
of
the
best
bedroom
she
wondered
that
she
should
possess
such
moral
ascendancy
over
the
woman
she
so
young
and
ingenuous
for
of
course
she
had
not
meant
to
remove
the
furniture
she
could
hear
madame
foucault
sobbing
quietly
in
one
of
the
other
rooms
and
her
lips
curled
before
evening
a
truly
astonishing
event
happened
perceiving
that
madame
foucault
showed
no
signs
of
bestirring
herself
sophia
with
good
nature
in
her
heart
but
not
on
her
tongue
went
to
her
and
said
shall
i
occupy
myself
with
the
dinner
madame
foucault
sobbed
more
loudly
that
would
be
very
amiable
on
your
part
madame
foucault
managed
at
last
to
reply
not
very
articulately
sophia
put
a
hat
on
and
went
to
the
grocer
the
grocer
who
kept
a
busy
establishment
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
clausel
was
a
and
wealthy
man
he
had
sent
his
young
wife
and
two
children
to
normandy
until
victory
over
the
prussians
should
be
more
assured
and
he
asked
sophia
whether
it
was
true
that
there
was
a
good
bedroom
to
let
in
the
flat
where
she
lived
his
servant
was
ill
of
smallpox
he
was
attacked
by
anxieties
and
fears
on
all
sides
he
would
not
enter
his
own
flat
on
account
of
possible
infection
he
liked
sophia
and
madame
foucault
had
been
a
customer
of
his
with
intervals
for
twenty
years
within
an
hour
he
had
arranged
to
rent
the
middle
bedroom
at
eighty
francs
a
month
and
to
take
his
meals
there
the
terms
were
modest
but
the
respectability
was
prodigious
all
the
glory
of
this
tenancy
fell
upon
sophia
madame
foucault
was
deeply
impressed
characteristically
she
began
at
once
to
construct
a
theory
that
sophia
had
only
to
walk
out
of
the
house
in
order
to
discover
ideal
tenants
for
the
rooms
also
she
regarded
the
advent
of
the
grocer
as
a
reward
from
providence
for
her
in
refusing
the
profits
of
sinfulness
sophia
felt
personally
responsible
to
the
grocer
for
his
comfort
and
so
she
herself
undertook
the
preparation
of
the
room
madame
foucault
was
amazed
at
the
thoroughness
of
her
housewifery
and
at
the
ingenuity
of
her
ideas
for
the
arrangement
of
furniture
she
sat
and
watched
with
admiration
sycophantic
but
real
that
night
when
sophia
was
in
bed
madame
foucault
came
into
the
room
and
dropped
down
by
the
side
of
the
bed
and
begged
sophia
to
be
her
moral
support
for
ever
she
confessed
herself
generally
she
explained
how
she
had
always
hated
the
negation
of
respectability
how
respectability
was
the
one
thing
that
she
had
all
her
life
passionately
desired
she
said
that
if
sophia
would
be
her
partner
in
the
letting
of
furnished
rooms
to
respectable
persons
she
would
obey
her
in
everything
she
gave
sophia
a
list
of
all
the
traits
in
character
which
she
admired
she
asked
sophia
to
influence
her
to
stand
by
her
she
insisted
that
she
would
sleep
on
the
sixth
floor
in
the
servant
tiny
room
and
she
had
a
vision
of
three
bedrooms
let
to
successful
tradesmen
she
was
in
an
ecstasy
of
repentance
and
good
intentions
sophia
consented
to
the
business
proposition
for
she
had
nothing
else
whatever
in
prospect
and
she
shared
madame
foucault
rosy
view
about
the
remunerativeness
of
the
bedrooms
with
three
tenants
who
took
meals
the
two
women
would
be
able
to
feed
themselves
for
nothing
and
still
make
a
profit
on
the
food
and
the
rents
would
be
clear
gain
and
she
felt
very
sorry
for
the
ageing
feckless
madame
foucault
whose
sincerity
was
obvious
the
association
between
them
would
be
strange
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
explain
it
to
luke
square
and
yet
if
there
was
anything
at
all
in
the
virtue
of
christian
charity
what
could
properly
be
urged
against
the
association
ah
murmured
madame
foucault
kissing
sophia
hands
it
is
then
that
i
recommence
my
life
you
will
see
you
will
see
you
have
saved
me
it
was
a
strange
sight
the
disfigured
courtesan
half
prostrate
before
the
beautiful
young
creature
proud
and
unassailable
in
the
instinctive
force
of
her
own
character
it
was
almost
a
didactic
tableau
fraught
with
lessons
for
the
vicious
sophia
was
happier
than
she
had
been
for
years
she
had
a
purpose
in
existence
she
had
a
fluid
soul
to
mould
to
her
will
according
to
her
wisdom
and
there
was
a
large
compassion
to
her
credit
public
opinion
could
not
intimidate
her
for
in
her
case
there
was
no
public
opinion
she
knew
nobody
nobody
had
the
right
to
question
her
doings
the
next
day
sunday
they
both
worked
hard
at
the
bedrooms
from
early
morning
the
grocer
was
installed
in
his
chamber
and
the
two
other
rooms
were
cleansed
as
they
had
never
been
cleansed
at
four
the
weather
being
more
magnificent
than
ever
madame
foucault
said
if
we
took
a
promenade
on
the
boulevard
sophia
reflected
they
were
partners
very
well
she
agreed
the
boulevard
was
crammed
with
gay
laughing
crowds
all
the
cafes
were
full
none
who
did
not
know
could
have
guessed
that
the
news
of
sedan
was
scarcely
a
day
old
in
the
capital
delirious
joy
reigned
in
the
glittering
sunshine
as
the
two
women
strolled
along
content
with
their
industry
and
their
resolves
they
came
to
a
national
guard
who
perched
on
a
ladder
was
chipping
away
the
n
from
the
official
sign
of
a
he
was
exchanging
jokes
with
a
circle
of
open
mouths
it
was
in
this
way
that
madame
foucault
and
sophia
learnt
of
the
establishment
of
a
republic
vive
la
republique
cried
madame
foucault
incontinently
and
then
apologized
to
sophia
for
the
lapse
they
listened
a
long
while
to
a
man
who
was
telling
strange
histories
of
the
empress
suddenly
sophia
noticed
that
madame
foucault
was
no
longer
at
her
elbow
she
glanced
about
and
saw
her
in
earnest
conversation
with
a
young
man
whose
face
seemed
familiar
she
remembered
it
was
the
young
man
with
whom
madame
foucault
had
quarrelled
on
the
night
when
sophia
found
her
prone
in
the
corridor
the
last
remaining
worshipper
of
the
courtesan
the
woman
face
was
quite
changed
by
her
agitation
sophia
drew
away
offended
she
watched
the
pair
from
a
distance
for
a
few
moments
and
then
furious
in
disillusion
she
escaped
from
the
fever
of
the
boulevards
and
walked
quietly
home
madame
foucault
did
not
return
apparently
madame
foucault
was
doomed
to
be
the
toy
of
chance
two
days
later
sophia
received
a
scrawled
letter
from
her
with
the
information
that
her
lover
had
required
that
she
should
accompany
him
to
brussels
as
paris
would
soon
be
getting
dangerous
he
adores
me
always
he
is
the
most
delicious
boy
as
i
have
always
said
this
is
the
grand
passion
of
my
life
i
am
happy
he
would
not
permit
me
to
come
to
you
he
has
spent
two
thousand
francs
on
clothes
for
me
since
naturally
i
had
nothing
and
so
on
no
word
of
apology
sophia
in
reading
the
letter
allowed
for
a
certain
exaggeration
and
twisting
of
the
truth
young
fool
fool
she
burst
out
angrily
she
did
not
mean
herself
she
meant
the
fatuous
adorer
of
that
dilapidated
horrible
woman
she
never
saw
her
again
doubtless
madame
foucault
fulfilled
her
own
prediction
as
to
her
ultimate
destiny
but
in
brussels
ii
sophia
still
possessed
about
a
hundred
pounds
and
had
she
chosen
to
leave
paris
and
france
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
her
from
doing
so
perhaps
if
she
had
chanced
to
visit
the
gare
lazare
or
the
gare
du
nord
the
sight
of
tens
of
thousands
of
people
flying
seawards
might
have
stirred
in
her
the
desire
to
flee
also
from
the
vague
coming
danger
but
she
did
not
visit
those
termini
she
was
too
busy
looking
after
niepce
her
grocer
moreover
she
would
not
quit
her
furniture
which
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
sort
of
rock
with
a
flat
full
of
furniture
she
considered
that
she
ought
to
be
able
to
devise
a
livelihood
the
enterprise
of
becoming
independent
was
already
indeed
begun
she
ardently
wished
to
be
independent
to
utilize
in
her
own
behalf
the
gifts
of
organization
foresight
commonsense
and
tenacity
which
she
knew
she
possessed
and
which
had
lain
idle
and
she
hated
the
idea
of
flight
chirac
returned
as
unexpectedly
as
he
had
gone
an
expedition
for
his
paper
had
occupied
him
with
his
lips
he
urged
her
to
go
but
his
eyes
spoke
differently
he
had
one
afternoon
a
mood
of
candid
despair
such
as
he
would
have
dared
to
show
only
to
one
in
whom
he
felt
great
confidence
they
will
come
to
paris
he
said
nothing
can
stop
them
and
then
he
gave
a
cynical
laugh
but
when
he
urged
her
to
go
she
said
and
what
about
my
furniture
and
i
promised
niepce
to
look
after
him
then
chirac
informed
her
that
he
was
without
a
lodging
and
that
he
would
like
to
rent
one
of
her
rooms
she
agreed
shortly
afterwards
he
introduced
a
acquaintance
named
carlier
the
of
his
newspaper
who
wished
to
rent
a
bedroom
thus
by
good
fortune
sophia
let
all
her
rooms
immediately
and
was
sure
of
over
two
hundred
francs
a
month
apart
from
the
profit
on
meals
supplied
on
this
latter
occasion
chirac
and
his
companion
too
was
quite
optimistic
reiterating
an
absolute
certitude
that
paris
could
never
be
invested
briefly
sophia
did
not
believe
him
she
believed
the
candidly
despairing
chirac
she
had
no
information
no
wide
theory
to
justify
her
pessimism
nothing
but
the
inward
conviction
that
the
race
capable
of
behaving
as
she
had
seen
it
behave
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
was
bound
to
be
defeated
she
loved
the
french
race
but
all
the
practical
teutonic
sagacity
in
her
wanted
to
take
care
of
it
in
its
difficulties
and
was
rather
angry
with
it
for
being
so
unfitted
to
take
care
of
itself
she
let
the
men
talk
and
with
careless
disdain
of
their
discussions
and
their
certainties
she
went
about
her
business
of
preparation
at
this
period
overworked
and
harassed
by
novel
responsibilities
and
risks
she
was
happier
for
days
together
than
she
had
ever
been
simply
because
she
had
a
purpose
in
life
and
was
depending
upon
herself
her
ignorance
of
the
military
and
political
situation
was
complete
the
situation
did
not
interest
her
what
interested
her
was
that
she
had
three
men
to
feed
wholly
or
partially
and
that
the
price
of
eatables
was
rising
she
bought
eatables
she
bought
fifty
pecks
of
potatoes
at
a
franc
a
peck
and
another
fifty
pecks
at
a
franc
and
a
quarter
double
the
normal
price
ten
hams
at
two
and
a
half
francs
a
pound
a
large
quantity
of
tinned
vegetables
and
fruits
a
sack
of
flour
rice
biscuits
coffee
lyons
sausage
dried
prunes
dried
figs
and
much
wood
and
charcoal
but
the
chief
of
her
purchases
was
cheese
of
which
her
mother
used
to
say
that
bread
and
cheese
and
water
made
a
complete
diet
many
of
these
articles
she
obtained
from
her
grocer
all
of
them
except
the
flour
and
the
biscuits
she
stored
in
the
cellar
belonging
to
the
flat
after
several
days
delay
for
the
parisian
workmen
were
too
elated
by
the
advent
of
a
republic
to
stoop
to
labour
she
caused
a
new
lock
to
be
fixed
on
the
her
activities
were
the
sensation
of
the
house
everybody
admired
but
no
one
imitated
one
morning
on
going
to
do
her
marketing
she
found
a
notice
across
the
shuttered
windows
of
her
creamery
in
the
rue
notre
dame
de
lorette
closed
for
want
of
milk
the
siege
had
begun
it
was
in
the
closing
of
the
creamery
that
the
siege
was
figured
for
her
in
this
and
in
eggs
at
five
sous
a
piece
she
went
elsewhere
for
her
milk
and
paid
a
franc
a
litre
for
it
that
evening
she
told
her
lodgers
that
the
price
of
meals
would
be
doubled
and
that
if
any
gentleman
thought
that
he
could
get
equally
good
meals
elsewhere
he
was
at
liberty
to
get
them
elsewhere
her
position
was
strengthened
by
the
appearance
of
another
candidate
for
a
room
a
friend
of
niepce
she
at
once
offered
him
her
own
room
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
a
month
you
see
she
said
there
is
a
piano
in
it
but
i
do
play
the
piano
the
man
protested
shocked
at
the
price
that
is
not
my
fault
she
said
he
agreed
to
pay
the
price
demanded
for
the
room
because
of
the
opportunity
of
getting
good
meals
much
cheaper
than
in
the
restaurants
like
niepce
he
was
a
his
wife
having
been
put
under
shelter
in
brittany
sophia
took
to
the
servant
bedroom
on
the
sixth
floor
it
measured
nine
feet
by
seven
and
had
no
window
save
a
skylight
but
sophia
was
in
a
fair
way
to
realize
a
profit
of
at
least
four
pounds
a
week
after
paying
for
everything
on
the
night
when
she
installed
herself
in
that
chamber
amid
a
world
of
domestics
and
poor
people
she
worked
very
late
and
the
rays
of
her
candles
shot
up
intermittently
through
the
skylight
into
a
black
heaven
at
intervals
she
flitted
up
and
down
the
stairs
with
a
candle
unknown
to
her
a
crowd
gradually
formed
opposite
the
house
in
the
street
and
at
about
one
in
the
morning
a
file
of
soldiers
woke
the
concierge
and
invaded
the
courtyard
and
every
window
was
suddenly
populated
with
heads
sophia
was
called
upon
to
prove
that
she
was
not
a
spy
signalling
to
the
prussians
three
quarters
of
an
hour
passed
before
her
innocence
was
established
and
the
staircases
cleared
of
uniforms
and
dishevelled
curiosity
the
childish
impossible
unreason
of
the
suspicion
against
her
completed
in
sophia
mind
the
ruin
of
the
reputation
of
the
french
people
as
a
sensible
race
she
was
extremely
caustic
the
next
day
to
her
boarders
except
for
this
episode
the
frequency
of
military
uniforms
in
the
streets
the
price
of
food
and
the
fact
that
at
least
one
house
in
four
was
flying
either
the
ambulance
flag
or
the
flag
of
a
foreign
embassy
in
an
absurd
hope
of
immunity
from
the
impending
bombardment
the
siege
did
not
exist
for
sophia
the
men
often
talked
about
their
and
disappeared
for
a
day
or
two
to
the
ramparts
but
she
was
too
busy
to
listen
to
them
she
thought
of
nothing
but
her
enterprise
which
absorbed
all
her
powers
she
arose
at
six
in
the
dark
and
by
niepce
and
his
friend
had
been
served
with
breakfast
and
much
general
work
was
already
done
at
eight
she
went
out
to
market
when
asked
why
she
continued
to
buy
at
a
high
price
articles
of
which
she
had
a
store
she
would
reply
i
am
keeping
all
that
till
things
are
much
dearer
this
was
regarded
as
astounding
astuteness
on
the
fifteenth
of
october
she
paid
the
quarter
rent
of
the
flat
four
hundred
francs
and
was
accepted
as
tenant
her
ears
were
soon
quite
accustomed
to
the
sound
of
cannon
and
she
felt
that
she
had
always
been
a
citizeness
of
paris
and
that
paris
had
always
been
besieged
she
did
not
speculate
about
the
end
of
the
siege
she
lived
from
day
to
day
occasionally
she
had
a
qualm
of
fear
when
the
firing
grew
momentarily
louder
or
when
she
heard
that
battles
had
been
fought
in
such
and
such
a
suburb
but
then
she
said
it
was
absurd
to
be
afraid
when
you
were
with
a
couple
of
million
people
all
in
the
same
plight
as
yourself
she
grew
reconciled
to
everything
she
even
began
to
like
her
tiny
bedroom
partly
because
it
was
so
easy
to
keep
warm
the
question
of
artificial
heat
was
growing
acute
in
paris
and
partly
because
it
ensured
her
privacy
down
in
the
flat
whatever
was
done
or
said
in
one
room
could
be
more
or
less
heard
in
all
the
others
owing
to
the
prevalence
of
doors
her
existence
in
the
first
half
of
november
had
become
regular
with
a
monotony
almost
absolute
only
the
number
of
meals
served
to
her
boarders
varied
slightly
from
day
to
day
all
these
repasts
save
now
and
then
one
in
the
evening
were
carried
into
the
bedrooms
by
the
charwoman
sophia
did
not
allow
herself
to
be
seen
much
except
in
the
afternoons
though
sophia
continued
to
increase
her
prices
and
was
now
selling
her
stores
at
an
immense
profit
she
never
approached
the
prices
current
outside
she
was
very
indignant
against
the
exploitation
of
paris
by
its
shopkeepers
who
had
vast
supplies
of
provender
and
were
hoarding
for
the
rise
but
the
force
of
their
example
was
too
great
for
her
to
ignore
it
entirely
she
contented
herself
with
about
half
their
gains
only
to
niepce
did
she
charge
more
than
to
the
others
because
he
was
a
shopkeeper
the
four
men
appreciated
their
paradise
in
them
developed
that
agreeable
feeling
of
security
which
solitary
males
find
only
under
the
roof
of
a
landlady
who
is
at
once
prompt
honest
and
a
votary
of
cleanliness
sophia
hung
a
slate
near
the
frontdoor
and
on
this
slate
they
wrote
their
requests
for
meals
for
being
called
for
etc
sophia
never
made
a
mistake
and
never
forgot
the
perfection
of
the
domestic
machine
amazed
these
men
who
had
been
accustomed
to
something
quite
different
and
who
every
day
heard
harrowing
stories
of
discomfort
and
swindling
from
their
acquaintances
they
even
admired
sophia
for
making
them
pay
if
not
too
high
still
high
they
thought
it
wonderful
that
she
should
tell
them
the
price
of
all
things
in
advance
and
even
show
them
how
to
avoid
expense
particularly
in
the
matter
of
warmth
she
arranged
rugs
for
each
of
them
so
that
they
could
sit
comfortably
in
their
rooms
with
nothing
but
a
small
charcoal
heater
for
the
hands
quite
naturally
they
came
to
regard
her
as
the
paragon
and
miracle
of
women
they
endowed
her
with
every
fine
quality
according
to
them
there
had
never
been
such
a
woman
in
the
history
of
mankind
there
could
not
have
been
she
became
legendary
among
their
friends
a
young
and
elegant
creature
surpassingly
beautiful
proud
queenly
unapproachable
scarcely
visible
a
marvellous
manager
a
fine
cook
and
artificer
of
strange
english
dishes
utterly
reliable
utterly
exact
and
with
habits
of
order
they
adored
the
slight
english
accent
which
gave
a
touch
of
the
exotic
to
her
very
correct
and
freely
idiomatic
french
in
short
sophia
was
perfect
for
them
an
impossible
woman
whatever
she
did
was
right
and
she
went
up
to
her
room
every
night
with
limbs
exhausted
but
with
head
clear
enough
to
balance
her
accounts
and
go
through
her
money
she
did
this
in
bed
with
thick
gloves
on
if
often
she
did
not
sleep
well
it
was
not
because
of
the
distant
guns
but
because
of
her
preoccupation
with
the
subject
of
finance
she
was
making
money
and
she
wanted
to
make
more
she
was
always
inventing
ways
of
economy
she
was
so
anxious
to
achieve
independence
that
money
was
always
in
her
mind
she
began
to
love
gold
to
love
hoarding
it
and
to
hate
paying
it
away
one
morning
her
charwoman
who
by
good
fortune
was
nearly
as
precise
as
sophia
herself
failed
to
appear
when
the
moment
came
for
serving
niepce
breakfast
sophia
hesitated
and
then
decided
to
look
after
the
old
man
personally
she
knocked
at
his
door
and
went
boldly
in
with
the
tray
and
candle
he
started
at
seeing
her
she
was
wearing
a
blue
apron
as
the
charwoman
did
but
there
could
be
no
mistaking
her
for
the
charwoman
niepce
looked
older
in
bed
than
when
dressed
he
had
a
rather
ridiculous
undignified
appearance
common
among
old
men
before
their
morning
toilette
is
achieved
and
a
nightcap
did
not
improve
it
his
rotund
paunch
lifted
the
bedclothes
upon
which
for
the
sake
of
extra
warmth
he
had
spread
unmajestic
garments
sophia
smiled
to
herself
but
the
contempt
implied
by
that
secret
smile
was
softened
by
the
thought
poor
old
man
she
told
him
briefly
that
she
supposed
the
charwoman
to
be
ill
he
coughed
and
moved
nervously
his
benevolent
and
simple
face
beamed
on
her
paternally
as
she
fixed
the
tray
by
the
bed
i
really
must
open
the
window
for
one
little
second
she
said
and
did
so
the
chill
air
of
the
street
came
through
the
closed
shutters
and
the
old
man
made
a
noise
as
of
shivering
she
pushed
back
the
shutters
and
closed
the
window
and
then
did
the
same
with
the
other
two
windows
it
was
almost
day
in
the
room
you
will
no
longer
need
the
candle
she
said
and
came
back
to
the
bedside
to
extinguish
it
the
benign
and
fatherly
old
man
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
fresh
from
the
tonic
of
pure
air
and
with
the
notion
of
his
ridiculousness
still
in
her
mind
she
was
staggered
for
an
instant
by
this
gesture
she
had
never
given
a
thought
to
the
temperament
of
the
old
grocer
the
husband
of
a
young
wife
she
could
not
always
imaginatively
keep
in
mind
the
effect
of
her
own
radiance
especially
under
such
circumstances
but
after
an
instant
her
precocious
cynicism
which
had
slept
sprang
up
naturally
i
might
have
expected
it
she
thought
with
blasting
scorn
take
away
your
hand
she
said
bitterly
to
the
amiable
old
fool
she
did
not
stir
he
obeyed
sheepishly
do
you
wish
to
remain
with
me
she
asked
and
as
he
did
not
immediately
answer
she
said
in
a
most
commanding
tone
answer
then
yes
he
said
feebly
well
behave
properly
she
went
towards
the
door
i
wished
only
he
stammered
i
do
not
wish
to
know
what
you
wished
she
said
afterwards
she
wondered
how
much
of
the
incident
had
been
overheard
the
other
breakfasts
she
left
outside
the
respective
doors
and
in
future
niepce
also
the
charwoman
never
came
again
she
had
caught
smallpox
and
she
died
of
it
thus
losing
a
good
situation
strange
to
say
sophia
did
not
replace
her
the
temptation
to
save
her
wages
and
food
was
too
strong
she
could
not
however
stand
waiting
for
hours
at
the
door
of
the
official
baker
and
the
official
butcher
one
of
a
long
line
of
frozen
women
for
the
daily
rations
of
bread
and
rations
of
meat
she
employed
the
concierge
boy
at
two
sous
an
hour
to
do
this
sometimes
he
would
come
in
with
his
hands
so
blue
and
cold
that
he
could
scarcely
hold
the
precious
cards
which
gave
the
right
to
the
rations
and
which
cost
chirac
an
hour
or
two
of
waiting
at
the
mayoral
offices
each
week
sophia
might
have
fed
her
flock
without
resorting
to
the
official
rations
but
she
would
not
sacrifice
the
economy
which
they
represented
she
demanded
thick
clothes
for
the
concierge
boy
and
received
boots
from
chirac
gloves
from
carlier
and
a
great
overcoat
from
niepce
the
weather
increased
in
severity
and
provisions
in
price
one
day
she
sold
to
the
wife
of
a
chemist
who
lived
on
the
first
floor
for
a
hundred
and
ten
francs
a
ham
for
which
she
had
paid
less
than
thirty
francs
she
was
conscious
of
a
thrill
of
joy
in
receiving
a
beautiful
banknote
and
a
gold
coin
in
exchange
for
a
mere
ham
by
this
time
her
total
cash
resources
had
grown
to
nearly
five
thousand
francs
it
was
astounding
and
the
reserves
in
the
cellar
were
still
considerable
and
the
sack
of
flour
that
encumbered
the
kitchen
was
still
more
than
half
full
the
death
of
the
faithful
charwoman
when
she
heard
of
it
produced
but
little
effect
on
sophia
who
was
so
overworked
and
so
completely
absorbed
in
her
own
affairs
that
she
had
no
nervous
energy
to
spare
for
sentimental
regrets
the
charwoman
by
whose
side
she
had
regularly
passed
many
hours
in
the
kitchen
so
that
she
knew
every
crease
in
her
face
and
fold
of
her
dress
vanished
out
of
sophia
memory
sophia
cleaned
and
arranged
two
of
the
bedrooms
in
the
morning
and
two
in
the
afternoon
she
had
stayed
in
hotels
where
fifteen
bedrooms
were
in
charge
of
a
single
chambermaid
and
she
thought
it
would
be
hard
if
she
could
not
manage
four
in
the
intervals
of
cooking
and
other
work
this
she
said
to
herself
by
way
of
excuse
for
not
engaging
another
charwoman
one
afternoon
she
was
rubbing
the
brass
knobs
of
the
numerous
doors
in
niepce
room
when
the
grocer
unexpectedly
came
in
she
glanced
at
him
sharply
there
was
a
look
in
his
eye
he
had
entered
the
flat
noiselessly
she
remembered
having
told
him
in
response
to
a
question
that
she
now
did
his
room
in
the
afternoon
why
should
he
have
left
his
shop
he
hung
up
his
hat
behind
the
door
with
the
meticulous
care
of
an
old
man
then
he
took
off
his
overcoat
and
rubbed
his
hands
you
do
well
to
wear
gloves
madame
he
said
it
is
dog
weather
i
do
not
wear
them
for
the
cold
she
replied
i
wear
them
so
as
not
to
spoil
my
hands
ah
truly
very
well
very
well
may
i
demand
some
wood
where
shall
i
find
it
i
do
not
wish
to
derange
you
she
refused
his
help
and
brought
wood
from
the
kitchen
counting
the
logs
audibly
before
him
shall
i
light
the
fire
now
she
asked
i
will
light
it
he
said
give
me
a
match
please
as
she
was
arranging
the
wood
and
paper
he
said
madame
will
you
listen
to
me
what
is
it
do
not
be
angry
he
said
have
i
not
proved
that
i
am
capable
of
respecting
you
i
continue
in
that
respect
it
is
with
all
that
respect
that
i
say
to
you
that
i
love
you
madame
no
remain
calm
i
implore
you
the
fact
was
that
sophia
showed
no
sign
of
not
remaining
calm
it
is
true
that
i
have
a
wife
but
what
do
you
wish
she
is
far
away
i
love
you
madly
he
proceeded
with
dignified
respect
i
know
i
am
old
but
i
am
rich
i
understand
your
character
you
are
a
lady
you
are
decided
direct
sincere
and
a
woman
of
business
i
have
the
greatest
respect
for
you
one
can
talk
to
you
as
one
could
not
to
another
woman
you
prefer
directness
and
sincerity
madame
i
will
give
you
two
thousand
francs
a
month
and
all
you
require
from
my
shop
if
you
will
be
amiable
to
me
i
am
very
solitary
i
need
the
society
of
a
charming
creature
who
would
be
sympathetic
two
thousand
francs
a
month
it
is
money
he
wiped
his
shiny
head
with
his
hand
sophia
was
bending
over
the
fire
she
turned
her
head
towards
him
is
that
all
she
said
quietly
you
could
count
on
my
discretion
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
appreciate
your
scruples
i
would
come
very
late
to
your
room
on
the
sixth
one
could
arrange
you
see
i
am
direct
like
you
she
had
an
impulse
to
order
him
tempestuously
out
of
the
flat
but
it
was
not
a
genuine
impulse
he
was
an
old
fool
why
not
treat
him
as
such
to
take
him
seriously
would
be
absurd
moreover
he
was
a
very
remunerative
boarder
do
not
be
stupid
she
said
with
cruel
tranquillity
do
not
be
an
old
fool
and
the
benign
but
fatuous
lecher
saw
the
enchanting
vision
of
sophia
with
her
natty
apron
and
her
amusing
gloves
sweep
and
fade
from
the
room
he
left
the
house
and
the
expensive
fire
warmed
an
empty
room
sophia
was
angry
with
him
he
had
evidently
planned
the
proposal
if
capable
of
respect
he
was
evidently
also
capable
of
chicane
but
she
supposed
these
frenchmen
were
all
alike
disgusting
and
decided
that
it
was
useless
to
worry
over
a
universal
fact
they
had
simply
no
shame
and
she
had
been
very
prudent
to
establish
herself
far
away
on
the
sixth
floor
she
hoped
that
none
of
the
other
boarders
had
overheard
niepce
outrageous
insolence
she
was
not
sure
if
chirac
was
not
writing
in
his
room
that
night
there
was
no
sound
of
cannon
in
the
distance
and
sophia
for
some
time
was
unable
to
sleep
she
woke
up
with
a
start
after
a
doze
and
struck
a
match
to
look
at
her
watch
it
had
stopped
she
had
forgotten
to
wind
it
up
which
omission
indicated
that
the
grocer
had
perturbed
her
more
than
she
thought
she
could
not
be
sure
how
long
she
had
slept
the
hour
might
be
two
or
it
might
be
six
impossible
for
her
to
rest
she
got
up
and
dressed
in
case
it
should
be
as
late
as
she
feared
and
crept
down
the
interminable
creaking
stairs
with
the
candle
as
she
descended
the
conviction
that
it
was
the
middle
of
the
night
grew
upon
her
and
she
stepped
more
softly
there
was
no
sound
save
that
caused
by
her
footfalls
with
her
latchkey
she
cautiously
opened
the
front
door
of
the
flat
and
entered
she
could
then
hear
the
noisy
ticking
of
the
small
cheap
clock
in
the
kitchen
at
the
same
moment
another
door
creaked
and
chirac
with
hair
all
tousled
but
fully
dressed
appeared
in
the
corridor
so
you
have
decided
to
sell
yourself
to
him
chirac
whispered
she
drew
away
instinctively
and
she
could
feel
herself
blushing
she
was
at
a
loss
she
saw
that
chirac
was
in
a
furious
rage
tremendously
moved
he
crept
towards
her
half
crouching
she
had
never
seen
anything
so
theatrical
as
his
movement
and
the
twitching
of
his
face
she
felt
that
she
too
ought
to
be
theatrical
that
she
ought
nobly
to
scorn
his
infamous
suggestion
his
unwarrantable
attack
even
supposing
that
she
had
decided
to
sell
herself
to
the
old
pasha
did
that
concern
him
a
dignified
silence
an
annihilating
glance
were
all
that
he
deserved
but
she
was
not
capable
of
this
heroic
behaviour
what
time
is
it
she
added
weakly
three
chirac
sneered
i
forgot
to
wind
up
my
watch
she
said
and
so
i
came
down
to
see
in
effect
he
spoke
sarcastically
as
if
saying
i
waited
for
you
and
here
you
are
she
said
to
herself
that
she
owed
him
nothing
but
all
the
time
she
felt
that
he
and
she
were
the
only
young
people
in
that
flat
and
that
she
did
owe
to
him
the
proof
that
she
was
guiltless
of
the
supreme
dishonour
of
youth
she
collected
her
forces
and
looked
at
him
you
should
be
ashamed
she
said
you
will
wake
the
others
and
niepce
will
he
need
to
be
wakened
niepce
is
not
here
she
said
niepce
door
was
unlatched
she
pushed
it
open
and
went
into
the
room
which
was
empty
and
bore
no
sign
of
having
been
used
come
and
satisfy
yourself
she
insisted
chirac
did
so
his
face
fell
she
took
her
watch
from
her
pocket
and
now
wind
my
watch
and
set
it
please
she
saw
that
he
was
in
anguish
he
could
not
take
the
watch
tears
came
into
his
eyes
then
he
hid
his
face
and
dashed
away
she
heard
a
murmur
that
sounded
like
forgive
me
and
the
banging
of
a
door
and
in
the
stillness
she
heard
the
regular
snoring
of
carlier
she
too
cried
her
vision
was
blurred
by
a
mist
and
she
stumbled
into
the
kitchen
and
seized
the
clock
and
carried
it
with
her
upstairs
and
shivered
in
the
intense
cold
of
the
night
she
wept
gently
for
a
very
long
time
what
a
shame
what
a
shame
she
said
to
herself
yet
she
did
not
quite
blame
chirac
the
frost
drove
her
into
bed
but
not
to
sleep
she
continued
to
cry
at
dawn
her
eyes
were
inflamed
with
weeping
she
was
back
in
the
kitchen
then
chirac
door
was
wide
open
he
had
left
the
flat
on
the
slate
was
written
i
shall
not
take
meals
iii
their
relations
were
permanently
changed
for
several
days
they
did
not
meet
at
all
and
when
at
the
end
of
the
week
chirac
was
obliged
at
last
to
face
sophia
in
order
to
pay
his
bill
he
had
a
most
grievous
expression
it
was
obvious
that
he
considered
himself
a
criminal
without
any
defence
to
offer
for
his
crime
he
seemed
to
make
no
attempt
to
hide
his
state
of
mind
but
he
said
nothing
as
for
sophia
she
preserved
a
mien
of
amiable
cheerfulness
she
exerted
herself
to
convince
him
by
her
attitude
that
she
bore
no
resentment
that
she
had
determined
to
forget
the
incident
that
in
short
she
was
the
forgiving
angel
of
his
dreams
she
did
not
however
succeed
entirely
in
being
quite
natural
confronted
by
his
misery
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
her
to
be
quite
natural
and
at
the
same
time
quite
cheerful
a
little
later
the
social
atmosphere
of
the
flat
began
to
grow
querulous
disputatious
and
perverse
the
nerves
of
everybody
were
seriously
strained
this
applied
to
the
whole
city
days
of
heavy
rains
followed
the
sharp
frosts
and
the
town
was
as
it
were
sodden
with
woe
the
gates
were
closed
and
though
of
the
inhabitants
never
went
outside
the
gates
the
definite
and
absolute
closing
of
them
demoralized
all
hearts
gas
was
no
longer
supplied
rats
cats
and
horses
were
being
eaten
and
pronounced
bad
the
siege
had
ceased
to
be
a
novelty
friends
did
not
invite
one
another
to
a
as
to
a
picnic
sophia
fatigued
by
regular
overwork
became
weary
of
the
situation
she
was
angry
with
the
prussians
for
dilatoriness
and
with
the
french
for
inaction
and
she
poured
out
her
english
spleen
on
her
boarders
the
boarders
told
each
other
in
secret
that
the
patronne
was
growing
formidable
chiefly
she
bore
a
grudge
against
the
shopkeepers
and
when
upon
a
rumour
of
peace
the
one
day
suddenly
blossomed
with
prodigious
quantities
of
all
edibles
at
highest
prices
thus
proving
that
the
famine
was
artificially
created
sophia
was
furious
niepce
in
particular
though
he
sold
goods
to
her
at
a
special
discount
suffered
indignities
a
few
days
later
that
benign
and
fatherly
man
put
himself
lamentably
in
the
wrong
by
attempting
to
introduce
into
his
room
a
charming
young
creature
who
knew
how
to
be
sympathetic
sophia
by
an
accident
unfortunate
for
the
grocer
caught
them
in
the
corridor
she
was
beside
herself
but
the
only
outward
symptoms
were
a
white
face
and
a
cold
steely
voice
that
grated
like
a
rasp
on
the
susceptibilities
of
the
adherents
of
aphrodite
at
this
period
sophia
had
certainly
developed
into
a
termagant
without
knowing
it
she
would
often
insist
now
on
talking
about
the
siege
and
hearing
everything
that
the
men
could
tell
her
her
comments
made
without
the
least
regard
for
the
justifiable
delicacy
of
their
feelings
as
frenchmen
sometimes
led
to
heated
exchanges
when
all
montmartre
and
the
quartier
breda
was
impassioned
by
the
appearance
from
outside
of
the
battalion
she
took
the
side
of
the
populace
and
would
not
credit
the
solemn
statement
of
the
journalists
proved
by
documents
that
these
maltreated
soldiers
were
not
cowards
in
flight
she
supported
the
women
who
had
spit
in
the
faces
of
the
she
actually
said
that
if
she
had
met
them
she
would
have
spit
too
really
she
was
convinced
of
the
innocence
of
the
but
something
prevented
her
from
admitting
it
the
dispute
ended
with
high
words
between
herself
and
chirac
the
next
day
chirac
came
home
at
an
unusual
hour
knocked
at
the
kitchen
door
and
said
i
must
give
notice
to
leave
you
why
she
demanded
curtly
she
was
kneading
flour
and
water
for
a
her
were
the
joy
of
the
household
my
paper
has
stopped
said
chirac
oh
she
added
thoughtfully
but
not
looking
at
him
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
leave
yes
he
said
this
place
is
beyond
my
means
i
do
not
need
to
tell
you
that
in
ceasing
to
appear
the
paper
has
omitted
to
pay
its
debts
the
house
owes
me
a
month
salary
so
i
must
leave
no
said
sophia
you
can
pay
me
when
you
have
money
he
shook
his
head
i
have
no
intention
of
accepting
your
kindness
have
you
got
any
money
she
abruptly
asked
none
said
he
it
is
the
disaster
quite
simply
then
you
will
be
forced
to
get
into
debt
somewhere
yes
but
not
here
not
to
you
truly
chirac
she
exclaimed
with
a
cajoling
voice
you
are
not
reasonable
nevertheless
it
is
like
that
he
said
with
decision
eh
well
she
turned
on
him
menacingly
it
will
not
be
like
that
you
understand
me
you
will
stay
and
you
will
pay
me
when
you
can
otherwise
we
shall
quarrel
do
you
imagine
i
shall
tolerate
your
childishness
just
because
you
were
angry
last
night
it
is
not
that
he
protested
you
ought
to
know
it
is
not
that
she
did
it
is
solely
that
i
can
not
permit
myself
to
enough
she
cried
peremptorily
stopping
him
and
then
in
a
quieter
tone
and
what
about
carlier
is
he
also
in
the
ditch
ah
he
has
money
said
chirac
with
sad
envy
you
also
one
day
said
she
you
stop
in
any
case
until
after
christmas
or
we
quarrel
is
it
agreed
her
accent
had
softened
you
are
too
good
he
yielded
i
can
not
quarrel
with
you
but
it
pains
me
to
accept
oh
she
snapped
dropping
into
the
vulgar
idiom
you
make
me
sweat
with
your
stupid
pride
is
it
that
that
you
call
friendship
go
away
now
how
do
you
wish
that
i
should
succeed
with
this
cake
while
you
station
yourself
there
to
distract
me
iv
but
in
three
days
chirac
with
amazing
luck
fell
into
another
situation
and
on
the
journal
des
debats
it
was
the
prussians
who
had
found
him
a
place
the
celebrated
payenneville
second
greatest
chroniqueur
of
his
time
had
caught
a
cold
while
doing
his
duty
as
a
national
guard
and
had
died
of
pneumonia
the
weather
was
severe
again
soldiers
were
being
frozen
to
death
at
aubervilliers
payenneville
position
was
taken
by
another
man
whose
post
was
offered
to
chirac
he
told
sophia
of
his
good
fortune
with
unconcealed
vanity
you
with
your
smile
she
said
impatiently
one
can
refuse
you
nothing
she
behaved
just
as
though
chirac
had
disgusted
her
she
humbled
him
but
with
his
his
airs
of
importance
as
a
member
of
the
editorial
staff
of
the
debats
were
comical
in
their
ingenuousness
on
the
very
same
day
carlier
gave
notice
to
leave
sophia
he
was
comparatively
rich
but
the
habits
which
had
enabled
him
to
arrive
at
independence
in
the
uncertain
vocation
of
a
journalist
would
not
allow
him
while
he
was
earning
nothing
to
spend
a
sou
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
he
had
decided
to
join
forces
with
a
widowed
sister
who
was
accustomed
to
parsimony
as
parsimony
is
understood
in
france
and
who
was
living
on
hoarded
potatoes
and
wine
there
said
sophia
you
have
lost
me
a
tenant
and
she
insisted
half
jocularly
and
half
seriously
that
carlier
was
leaving
because
he
could
not
stand
chirac
infantile
conceit
the
flat
was
full
of
acrimonious
words
on
christmas
morning
chirac
lay
in
bed
rather
late
the
newspapers
did
not
appear
that
day
paris
seemed
to
be
in
a
sort
of
stupor
about
eleven
he
came
to
the
kitchen
door
i
must
speak
with
you
he
said
his
tone
impressed
sophia
enter
said
she
he
went
in
and
closed
the
door
like
a
conspirator
we
must
have
a
little
fete
he
said
you
and
i
fete
she
repeated
what
an
idea
how
can
i
leave
if
the
idea
had
not
appealed
to
the
secrecies
of
her
heart
stirring
desires
and
souvenirs
upon
which
the
dust
of
time
lay
thick
she
would
not
have
begun
by
suggesting
difficulties
she
would
have
begun
by
a
flat
refusal
that
is
nothing
he
said
vigorously
it
is
christmas
and
i
must
have
a
chat
with
you
we
can
not
chat
here
i
have
not
had
a
true
little
chat
with
you
since
you
were
you
will
come
with
me
to
a
restaurant
for
lunch
she
laughed
and
the
lunch
of
my
lodgers
you
will
serve
it
a
little
earlier
we
will
go
out
immediately
afterwards
and
we
will
return
in
time
for
you
to
prepare
dinner
it
is
quite
simple
she
shook
her
head
you
are
mad
she
said
crossly
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
offer
you
something
he
went
on
scowling
you
comprehend
me
i
wish
you
to
lunch
with
me
i
demand
it
and
you
are
not
going
to
refuse
me
he
was
very
close
to
her
in
the
little
kitchen
and
he
spoke
fiercely
bullyingly
exactly
as
she
had
spoken
to
him
when
insisting
that
he
should
live
on
credit
with
her
for
a
while
you
are
very
rude
she
parried
if
i
am
rude
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
he
held
out
uncompromisingly
you
will
lunch
with
me
i
hold
to
it
how
can
i
be
dressed
she
protested
that
does
not
concern
me
arrange
that
as
you
can
it
was
the
most
curious
invitation
to
a
christmas
dinner
imaginable
at
a
quarter
past
twelve
they
issued
forth
side
by
side
heavily
clad
into
the
mournful
streets
the
sky
presaged
snow
the
air
was
bitterly
cold
and
yet
damp
there
were
no
fiacres
in
the
little
place
which
forms
the
mouth
of
the
rue
clausel
in
the
rue
notre
dame
de
lorette
a
single
empty
omnibus
was
toiling
up
the
steep
glassy
slope
the
horses
slipping
and
recovering
themselves
in
response
to
the
which
sounded
in
the
streets
as
in
an
empty
vault
higher
up
in
the
rue
fontaine
one
of
the
few
shops
that
were
open
displayed
this
announcement
a
large
selection
of
cheeses
for
new
year
gifts
they
laughed
last
year
at
this
moment
said
chirac
i
was
thinking
of
only
one
thing
the
masked
ball
at
the
opera
i
could
not
sleep
after
it
this
year
even
the
churches
are
not
open
and
you
she
put
her
lips
together
do
not
ask
me
she
said
they
proceeded
in
silence
we
are
triste
we
others
he
said
but
the
prussians
in
their
trenches
they
can
not
be
so
gay
either
their
families
and
their
christmas
trees
must
be
lacking
to
them
let
us
laugh
the
place
blanche
and
the
boulevard
de
clichy
were
no
more
lively
than
the
lesser
streets
and
squares
there
was
no
life
anywhere
scarcely
a
sound
not
even
the
sound
of
cannon
nobody
knew
anything
christmas
had
put
the
city
into
a
lugubrious
trance
of
hopelessness
chirac
took
sophia
arm
across
the
place
blanche
and
a
few
yards
up
the
rue
lepic
he
stopped
at
a
small
restaurant
famous
among
the
initiated
and
known
as
the
little
louis
they
entered
descending
by
two
steps
into
a
confined
and
sombrely
picturesque
interior
sophia
saw
that
they
were
expected
chirac
must
have
paid
a
previous
visit
to
the
restaurant
that
morning
several
disordered
tables
showed
that
people
had
already
lunched
and
left
but
in
the
corner
was
a
table
for
two
freshly
laid
in
the
best
manner
of
such
restaurants
that
is
to
say
with
a
checked
cloth
and
two
other
cloths
almost
as
large
as
the
folded
as
serviettes
and
arranged
flat
on
two
thick
plates
between
solid
steel
cutlery
a
out
of
which
one
ground
by
turning
a
handle
a
two
and
two
common
tumblers
the
phenomena
which
differentiated
this
table
from
the
ordinary
table
were
a
champagne
bottle
and
a
couple
of
champagne
glasses
champagne
was
one
of
the
few
items
which
had
not
increased
in
price
during
the
siege
the
landlord
and
his
wife
were
eating
in
another
corner
a
fat
slatternly
pair
whom
no
privations
of
a
siege
could
have
emaciated
the
landlord
rose
he
was
dressed
as
a
chef
all
in
white
with
the
sacred
cap
but
a
soiled
white
everything
in
the
place
was
untidy
unkempt
and
more
or
less
unclean
except
just
the
table
upon
which
champagne
was
waiting
and
yet
the
restaurant
was
agreeable
reassuring
the
landlord
greeted
his
customers
as
honest
friends
his
greasy
face
was
honest
and
so
was
the
pale
weary
humorous
face
of
his
wife
chirac
saluted
her
you
see
said
she
across
from
the
other
corner
indicating
a
bone
on
her
plate
this
is
diane
ah
the
poor
animal
exclaimed
chirac
sympathetically
what
would
you
said
the
landlady
it
cost
too
dear
to
feed
her
and
she
was
so
mignonne
one
could
not
watch
her
grow
thin
i
was
saying
to
my
wife
the
landlord
put
in
how
she
would
have
enjoyed
that
bone
diane
he
roared
with
laughter
sophia
and
the
landlady
exchanged
a
curious
sad
smile
at
this
pleasantry
which
had
been
by
the
landlord
for
perhaps
the
thousandth
time
during
the
siege
but
which
he
evidently
regarded
as
quite
new
and
original
eh
well
he
continued
confidentially
to
chirac
i
have
found
for
you
something
very
good
half
a
duck
and
in
a
still
lower
tone
and
it
will
not
cost
you
too
dear
no
attempt
to
realize
more
than
a
modest
profit
was
ever
made
in
that
restaurant
it
possessed
a
regular
clientele
who
knew
the
value
of
the
little
money
they
had
and
who
knew
also
how
to
appreciate
sincere
and
accomplished
cookery
the
landlord
was
the
chef
and
he
was
always
referred
to
as
the
chef
even
by
his
wife
how
did
you
get
that
chirac
asked
ah
said
the
landlord
mysteriously
i
have
one
of
my
friends
who
comes
from
villeneuve
georges
refugee
you
know
in
fine
a
wave
of
the
fat
hands
suggesting
that
chirac
should
not
inquire
too
closely
in
effect
chirac
commented
but
it
is
very
chic
that
i
believe
you
that
it
is
chic
said
the
landlady
sturdily
it
is
charming
sophia
murmured
politely
and
then
a
quite
little
salad
said
the
landlord
but
that
that
is
still
more
striking
said
chirac
the
landlord
winked
the
fact
was
that
the
commerce
which
resulted
in
fresh
green
vegetables
in
the
heart
of
a
beleagured
town
was
notorious
and
then
also
a
quite
little
cheese
said
sophia
slightly
imitating
the
tone
of
the
landlord
as
she
drew
from
the
inwardness
of
her
cloak
a
small
round
parcel
it
contained
a
brie
cheese
in
fairly
good
condition
it
was
worth
at
least
fifty
francs
and
it
had
cost
sophia
less
than
two
francs
the
landlady
joined
the
landlord
in
inspecting
this
wondrous
jewel
sophia
seized
a
knife
and
cut
a
slice
for
the
landlady
table
madame
is
too
good
said
the
landlady
confused
by
this
noble
generosity
and
bearing
the
gift
off
to
her
table
as
a
will
hurriedly
seek
solitude
with
a
sumptuous
morsel
the
landlord
beamed
chirac
was
enchanted
in
the
intimate
and
unaffected
cosiness
of
that
interior
the
vast
stupefied
melancholy
of
the
city
seemed
to
be
forgotten
to
have
lost
its
sway
then
the
landlord
brought
a
hot
brick
for
the
feet
of
madame
it
was
more
an
acknowledgment
of
the
slice
of
cheese
than
a
necessity
for
the
restaurant
was
very
warm
the
tiny
kitchen
opened
directly
into
it
and
the
door
between
the
two
was
open
there
was
no
ventilation
whatever
it
is
a
friend
of
mine
said
the
landlord
proudly
in
the
way
of
gossip
as
he
served
an
undescribed
soup
a
butcher
in
the
faubourg
honore
who
has
bought
the
three
elephants
of
the
jardin
des
plantes
for
thousand
francs
eyebrows
were
lifted
he
uncorked
the
champagne
as
she
drank
the
first
mouthful
she
had
long
lost
her
youthful
aversion
for
wine
sophia
had
a
glimpse
of
herself
in
a
tilted
mirror
hung
rather
high
on
the
opposite
wall
it
was
several
months
since
she
had
attired
herself
with
ceremoniousness
the
sudden
unexpected
vision
of
elegance
and
pallid
beauty
pleased
her
and
the
instant
effect
of
the
champagne
was
to
renew
in
her
mind
a
forgotten
conception
of
the
goodness
of
life
and
of
the
joys
which
she
had
so
long
missed
v
at
two
they
were
alone
in
the
little
salon
of
the
restaurant
and
vaguely
in
their
dreamy
and
feverish
minds
that
were
too
preoccupied
to
control
with
precision
their
warm
relaxed
bodies
there
floated
the
illusion
that
the
restaurant
belonged
to
them
and
that
in
it
they
were
at
home
it
was
no
longer
a
restaurant
but
a
retreat
and
shelter
from
hard
life
the
chef
and
his
wife
were
dozing
in
an
inner
room
the
champagne
was
drunk
the
adorable
cheese
was
eaten
and
they
were
sipping
marc
de
bourgogne
they
sat
at
right
angles
to
one
another
close
to
one
another
with
brains
aswing
full
of
good
nature
and
quick
sympathy
their
flesh
content
and
yet
expectant
in
a
pause
of
the
conversation
which
entirely
banal
and
fragmentary
had
seemed
to
reach
the
acme
of
agreeableness
chirac
put
his
hand
on
the
hand
of
sophia
as
it
rested
limp
on
the
littered
table
accidentally
she
caught
his
eye
she
had
not
meant
to
do
so
they
both
became
his
thin
bearded
face
had
more
than
ever
that
wistfulness
which
always
softened
towards
him
the
uncompromisingness
of
her
character
he
had
the
look
of
a
child
for
her
gerald
had
sometimes
shown
the
same
look
but
indeed
she
was
now
one
of
those
women
for
whom
all
men
and
especially
all
men
in
a
tender
mood
are
invested
with
a
certain
incurable
quality
of
childishness
she
had
not
withdrawn
her
hand
at
once
and
so
she
could
not
withdraw
it
at
all
he
gazed
at
her
with
timid
audacity
her
eyes
were
liquid
what
are
you
thinking
about
she
asked
i
was
asking
myself
what
i
should
have
done
if
you
had
refused
to
come
and
what
should
you
have
done
assuredly
something
terribly
inconvenient
he
replied
with
the
large
importance
of
a
man
who
is
in
the
domain
of
pure
supposition
he
leaned
towards
her
my
very
dear
friend
he
said
in
a
different
voice
getting
bolder
it
was
infinitely
sweet
to
her
voluptuously
sweet
this
basking
in
the
heat
of
temptation
it
certainly
did
seem
to
her
then
the
one
real
pleasure
in
the
world
her
body
might
have
been
saying
to
his
see
how
ready
i
am
her
body
might
have
been
saying
to
his
look
into
my
mind
for
you
i
have
no
modesty
look
and
see
all
that
is
there
the
veil
of
convention
seemed
to
have
been
rent
their
attitude
to
each
other
was
almost
that
of
lover
and
mistress
between
whom
a
single
glance
may
be
charged
with
the
secrets
of
the
past
and
promises
for
the
future
morally
she
was
his
mistress
in
that
moment
he
released
her
hand
and
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
i
love
thee
he
whispered
with
great
emotion
her
face
changed
and
hardened
you
must
not
do
that
she
said
coldly
unkindly
harshly
she
scowled
she
would
not
abate
one
crease
in
her
forehead
to
the
appeal
of
his
surprised
glance
yet
she
did
not
want
to
repulse
him
the
instinct
which
repulsed
him
was
not
within
her
control
just
as
a
shy
man
will
obstinately
refuse
an
invitation
which
he
is
hungering
to
accept
so
though
not
from
shyness
she
was
compelled
to
repulse
chirac
perhaps
if
her
desires
had
not
been
laid
to
sleep
by
excessive
physical
industry
and
nervous
strain
the
sequel
might
have
been
different
chirac
like
most
men
who
have
once
found
a
woman
weak
imagined
that
he
understood
women
profoundly
he
thought
of
women
as
the
occidental
thinks
of
the
chinese
as
a
race
apart
mysterious
but
capable
of
being
infallibly
comprehended
by
the
application
of
a
few
leading
principles
of
psychology
moreover
he
was
in
earnest
he
was
hard
driven
and
he
was
honest
he
continued
respectfully
obedient
in
withdrawing
his
arm
very
dear
friend
he
urged
with
undaunted
confidence
you
must
know
that
i
love
you
she
shook
her
head
impatiently
all
the
time
wondering
what
it
was
that
prevented
her
from
slipping
into
his
arms
she
knew
that
she
was
treating
him
badly
by
this
brusque
change
of
front
but
she
could
not
help
it
then
she
began
to
feel
sorry
for
him
we
have
been
very
good
friends
he
said
i
have
always
admired
you
enormously
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
dare
to
love
you
until
that
day
when
i
overheard
that
old
villain
niepce
make
his
advances
then
when
i
perceived
my
acute
jealousy
i
knew
that
i
was
loving
you
ever
since
i
have
thought
only
of
you
i
swear
to
you
that
if
you
will
not
belong
to
me
it
is
already
finished
for
me
altogether
never
have
i
seen
a
woman
like
you
so
strong
so
proud
so
kind
and
so
beautiful
you
are
astonishing
yes
astonishing
no
other
woman
could
have
drawn
herself
out
of
an
impossible
situation
as
you
have
done
since
the
disappearance
of
your
husband
for
me
you
are
a
woman
unique
i
am
very
sincere
besides
you
know
it
dear
friend
she
shook
her
head
passionately
she
did
not
love
him
but
she
was
moved
and
she
wanted
to
love
him
she
wanted
to
yield
to
him
only
liking
him
and
to
love
afterwards
but
this
obstinate
instinct
held
her
back
i
do
not
say
now
chirac
went
on
let
me
hope
the
latin
theatricality
of
his
gestures
and
his
tone
made
her
sorrowful
for
him
my
poor
chirac
she
plaintively
murmured
and
began
to
put
on
her
gloves
i
shall
hope
he
persisted
she
pursed
her
lips
he
seized
her
violently
by
the
waist
she
drew
her
face
away
from
his
firmly
she
was
not
hard
not
angry
now
disconcerted
by
her
compassion
he
loosed
her
my
poor
chirac
she
said
i
ought
not
to
have
come
i
must
go
it
is
perfectly
useless
believe
me
no
no
he
whispered
fiercely
she
stood
up
and
the
abrupt
movement
pushed
the
table
gratingly
across
the
floor
the
throbbing
spell
of
the
flesh
was
snapped
like
a
stretched
string
and
the
scene
over
the
landlord
roused
from
his
doze
stumbled
in
chirac
had
nothing
but
the
bill
as
a
reward
for
his
pains
he
was
baffled
they
left
the
restaurant
silently
with
a
foolish
air
dusk
was
falling
on
the
mournful
streets
and
the
were
lighting
the
miserable
oil
lamps
that
had
replaced
gas
they
two
and
the
lamplighters
and
an
omnibus
were
alone
in
the
streets
the
gloom
was
awful
it
was
desolating
the
universal
silence
seemed
to
be
the
silence
of
despair
steeped
in
woe
sophia
thought
wearily
upon
the
hopeless
problem
of
existence
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
and
chirac
had
created
this
woe
out
of
nothing
and
yet
it
was
an
incurable
woe
chapter
vii
success
i
sophia
lay
awake
one
night
in
the
room
lately
quitted
by
carlier
that
silent
negation
of
individuality
had
come
and
gone
and
left
scarcely
any
record
of
himself
either
in
his
room
or
in
the
memories
of
those
who
had
surrounded
his
existence
in
the
house
sophia
had
decided
to
descend
from
the
sixth
floor
partly
because
the
temptation
of
a
large
room
after
months
in
a
cubicle
was
rather
strong
but
more
because
of
late
she
had
been
obliged
to
barricade
the
door
of
the
cubicle
with
a
chest
of
drawers
owing
to
the
propensities
of
a
new
tenant
of
the
sixth
floor
it
was
useless
to
complain
to
the
concierge
the
sole
effective
argument
was
the
chest
of
drawers
and
even
that
was
frailer
than
sophia
could
have
wished
hence
finally
her
retreat
she
heard
the
of
the
flat
open
then
it
was
shut
with
nervous
violence
the
resonance
of
its
closing
would
have
certainly
wakened
less
accomplished
sleepers
than
niepce
and
his
friend
whose
snores
continued
with
undisturbed
regularity
after
a
pause
of
shuffling
a
match
was
struck
and
feet
crept
across
the
corridor
with
the
most
exaggerated
precautions
against
noise
there
followed
the
unintentional
bang
of
another
door
it
was
decidedly
the
entry
of
a
man
without
the
slightest
natural
aptitude
for
furtive
irruptions
the
clock
in
niepce
room
which
the
grocer
had
persuaded
to
exact
chimed
three
with
its
delicate
ting
for
several
days
past
chirac
had
been
mysteriously
engaged
very
late
at
the
bureaux
of
the
debats
no
one
knew
the
nature
of
his
employment
he
said
nothing
except
to
inform
sophia
that
he
would
continue
to
come
home
about
three
until
further
notice
she
had
insisted
on
leaving
in
his
room
the
materials
and
apparatus
for
a
light
meal
naturally
he
had
protested
with
the
irrational
obstinacy
of
a
physically
weak
man
who
sticks
to
it
that
he
can
defy
the
laws
of
nature
but
he
had
protested
in
vain
his
general
conduct
since
christmas
day
had
frightened
sophia
in
spite
of
her
tendency
to
stifle
facile
alarms
at
their
birth
he
had
eaten
scarcely
anything
at
all
and
he
went
about
with
the
face
of
a
man
dying
of
a
broken
heart
the
change
in
him
was
indeed
tragic
and
instead
of
improving
he
grew
worse
have
i
done
this
sophia
asked
herself
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
have
done
this
it
is
absurd
and
ridiculous
that
he
should
behave
so
her
thoughts
were
employed
alternately
in
sympathizing
with
him
and
in
despising
him
in
blaming
herself
and
in
blaming
him
when
they
spoke
they
spoke
awkwardly
as
though
one
or
both
of
them
had
committed
a
shameful
crime
which
could
not
even
be
mentioned
the
atmosphere
of
the
flat
was
tainted
by
the
horror
and
sophia
could
not
offer
him
a
bowl
of
soup
without
wondering
how
he
would
look
at
her
or
avoid
looking
and
without
carefully
arranging
in
advance
her
own
gestures
and
speech
existence
was
a
nightmare
of
at
last
they
have
unmasked
their
batteries
he
had
exclaimed
with
painful
gaiety
two
days
after
christmas
when
the
besiegers
had
recommenced
their
cannonade
he
tried
to
imitate
the
strange
general
joy
of
the
city
which
had
been
roused
from
apathy
by
the
recurrence
of
a
familiar
noise
but
the
effort
was
a
deplorable
failure
and
sophia
condemned
not
merely
the
failure
of
chirac
imitation
but
the
thing
imitated
childish
she
thought
yet
despise
the
feebleness
of
chirac
behaviour
as
she
might
she
was
deeply
impressed
genuinely
astonished
by
the
gravity
and
persistence
of
the
symptoms
he
must
have
been
getting
himself
into
a
state
about
me
for
a
long
time
she
thought
surely
he
could
not
have
gone
mad
like
this
all
in
a
day
or
two
but
i
never
noticed
anything
no
honestly
i
never
noticed
anything
and
just
as
her
behaviour
in
the
restaurant
had
shaken
chirac
confidence
in
his
knowledge
of
the
other
sex
so
now
the
singular
behaviour
of
chirac
shook
hers
she
was
taken
aback
she
was
frightened
though
she
pretended
not
to
be
frightened
she
had
lived
over
and
over
again
the
scene
in
the
restaurant
she
asked
herself
over
and
over
again
if
really
she
had
not
beforehand
expected
him
to
make
love
to
her
in
the
restaurant
she
could
not
decide
exactly
when
she
had
begun
to
expect
a
declaration
but
probably
a
long
time
before
the
meal
was
finished
she
had
foreseen
it
and
might
have
stopped
it
but
she
had
not
chosen
to
stop
it
curiosity
concerning
not
merely
him
but
also
herself
had
tempted
her
tacitly
to
encourage
him
she
asked
herself
over
and
over
again
why
she
had
repulsed
him
it
struck
her
as
curious
that
she
had
repulsed
him
was
it
because
she
was
a
married
woman
was
it
because
she
had
moral
scruples
was
it
at
bottom
because
she
did
not
care
for
him
was
it
because
she
could
not
care
for
anybody
was
it
because
his
fervid
manner
of
offended
her
english
phlegm
and
did
she
feel
pleased
or
displeased
by
his
forbearance
in
not
renewing
the
assault
she
could
not
answer
she
did
not
know
but
all
the
time
she
knew
that
she
wanted
love
only
she
conceived
a
different
kind
of
love
placid
regular
somewhat
stern
somewhat
above
the
plane
of
whims
moods
caresses
and
all
mere
fleshly
contacts
not
that
she
considered
that
she
despised
these
things
though
she
did
what
she
wanted
was
a
love
that
was
too
proud
too
independent
to
exhibit
frankly
either
its
joy
or
its
pain
she
hated
a
display
of
sentiment
and
even
in
the
most
intimate
abandonments
she
would
have
made
reserves
and
would
have
expected
reserves
trusting
to
a
powers
of
divination
and
to
her
own
the
foundation
of
her
character
was
a
haughty
moral
independence
and
this
quality
was
what
she
most
admired
in
others
chirac
inability
to
draw
from
his
own
pride
strength
to
sustain
himself
against
the
blow
of
her
refusal
gradually
killed
in
her
the
sexual
desire
which
he
had
aroused
and
which
during
a
few
days
flickered
up
under
the
stimulus
of
fancy
and
of
regret
sophia
saw
with
increasing
clearness
that
her
unreasoning
instinct
had
been
right
in
saying
him
nay
and
when
in
spite
of
this
regrets
still
visited
her
she
would
comfort
herself
in
thinking
i
can
not
be
bothered
with
all
that
sort
of
thing
it
is
not
worth
while
what
does
it
lead
to
is
not
life
complicated
enough
without
that
no
no
i
will
stay
as
i
am
at
any
rate
i
know
what
i
am
in
for
as
things
are
and
she
would
reflect
upon
her
hopeful
financial
situation
and
the
approaching
prospect
of
a
constantly
sufficient
income
and
a
little
thrill
of
impatience
against
the
interminable
and
gigantic
foolishness
of
the
siege
would
take
her
but
her
in
presence
of
chirac
did
not
abate
as
she
lay
in
bed
she
awaited
accustomed
sounds
which
should
have
connoted
chirac
definite
retirement
for
the
night
her
ear
however
caught
no
sound
whatever
from
his
room
then
she
imagined
that
there
was
a
smell
of
burning
in
the
flat
she
sat
up
and
sniffed
anxiously
of
a
sudden
wideawake
and
apprehensive
and
then
she
was
sure
that
the
smell
of
burning
was
not
in
her
imagination
the
bedroom
was
in
perfect
darkness
feverishly
she
searched
with
her
right
hand
for
the
matches
on
the
and
knocked
candlestick
and
matches
to
the
floor
she
seized
her
which
was
spread
over
the
bed
and
put
it
on
aiming
for
the
door
her
feet
were
bare
she
discovered
the
door
in
the
passage
she
could
discern
nothing
at
first
and
then
she
made
out
a
thin
line
of
light
which
indicated
the
bottom
of
chirac
door
the
smell
of
burning
was
strong
and
unmistakable
she
went
towards
the
faint
light
fumbled
for
the
with
her
palm
and
opened
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
call
out
and
ask
what
was
the
matter
the
house
was
not
on
fire
but
it
might
have
been
she
had
left
on
the
table
at
the
foot
of
chirac
bed
a
small
and
a
saucepan
of
bouillon
all
that
chirac
had
to
do
was
to
ignite
the
lamp
and
put
the
saucepan
on
it
he
had
ignited
the
lamp
having
previously
raised
the
double
wicks
and
had
then
dropped
into
the
chair
by
the
table
just
as
he
was
and
sunk
forward
and
gone
to
sleep
with
his
head
lying
sideways
on
the
table
he
had
not
put
the
saucepan
on
the
lamp
he
had
not
lowered
the
wicks
and
the
flames
capped
with
thick
black
smoke
were
waving
slowly
to
and
fro
within
a
few
inches
of
his
loose
hair
his
hat
had
rolled
along
the
floor
he
was
wearing
his
great
overcoat
and
one
woollen
glove
the
other
glove
had
lodged
on
his
slanting
knee
a
candle
was
also
burning
sophia
hastened
forward
as
it
were
surreptitiously
and
with
a
movement
turned
down
the
wicks
of
the
lamp
black
specks
were
falling
on
the
table
happily
the
saucepan
was
covered
or
the
bouillon
would
have
been
ruined
chirac
made
a
spectacle
and
sophia
was
aware
of
deep
and
painful
emotion
in
seeing
him
thus
he
must
have
been
utterly
exhausted
and
broken
by
loss
of
sleep
he
was
a
man
incapable
of
regular
hours
incapable
of
treating
his
body
with
decency
though
going
to
bed
at
three
he
had
continued
to
rise
at
his
usual
hour
he
looked
like
one
dead
but
more
sad
more
wistful
outside
in
the
street
a
fog
reigned
and
his
thin
draggled
beard
was
jewelled
with
the
moisture
of
it
his
attitude
had
the
unconsidered
and
violent
prostration
of
an
overspent
dog
the
beaten
animal
in
him
was
expressed
in
every
detail
of
that
posture
it
showed
even
in
his
white
drawn
eyelids
and
in
the
falling
of
a
finger
all
his
face
was
very
sad
it
appealed
for
mercy
as
the
undefended
face
of
sleep
always
appeals
it
was
so
helpless
so
exposed
so
simple
it
recalled
sophia
to
a
sense
of
the
inner
mysteries
of
life
reminding
her
somehow
that
humanity
walks
ever
on
a
thin
crust
over
terrific
abysses
she
did
not
physically
shudder
but
her
soul
shuddered
she
mechanically
placed
the
saucepan
on
the
lamp
and
the
noise
awakened
chirac
he
groaned
at
first
he
did
not
perceive
her
when
he
saw
that
some
one
was
looking
down
at
him
he
did
not
immediately
realize
who
this
some
one
was
he
rubbed
his
eyes
with
his
fists
exactly
like
a
baby
and
sat
up
and
the
chair
cracked
what
then
he
demanded
oh
madame
i
ask
pardon
what
you
have
nearly
destroyed
the
house
she
said
i
smelt
fire
and
i
came
in
i
was
just
in
time
there
is
no
danger
now
but
please
be
careful
she
made
as
if
to
move
towards
the
door
but
what
did
i
do
he
asked
his
eyelids
wavering
she
explained
he
rose
from
his
chair
unsteadily
she
told
him
to
sit
down
again
and
he
obeyed
as
though
in
a
dream
i
can
go
now
she
said
wait
one
moment
he
murmured
i
ask
pardon
i
should
not
know
how
to
thank
you
you
are
truly
too
good
will
you
wait
one
moment
his
tone
was
one
of
supplication
he
gazed
at
her
a
little
dazzled
by
the
light
and
by
her
the
lamp
and
the
candle
illuminated
the
lower
part
of
her
face
theatrically
and
showed
the
texture
of
her
blue
flannel
peignoir
the
pattern
of
a
part
of
the
lace
collar
was
silhouetted
in
shadow
on
her
cheek
her
face
was
flushed
and
her
hair
hung
down
unconfined
evidently
he
could
not
recover
from
his
excusable
astonishment
at
the
apparition
of
such
a
figure
in
his
room
what
is
it
now
she
said
the
faint
quizzical
emphasis
which
she
put
on
the
indicated
the
essential
of
her
thought
the
sight
of
him
touched
her
and
filled
her
with
a
womanly
sympathy
but
that
sympathy
was
only
the
envelope
of
her
disdain
of
him
she
could
not
admire
weakness
she
could
but
pity
it
with
a
pity
in
which
scorn
was
mingled
her
instinct
was
to
treat
him
as
a
child
he
had
failed
in
human
dignity
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
had
not
previously
been
quite
certain
whether
she
could
not
love
him
but
that
now
she
was
quite
certain
she
was
close
to
him
she
saw
the
wounds
of
a
soul
that
could
not
hide
its
wounds
and
she
resented
the
sight
she
was
hard
she
would
not
make
allowances
and
she
revelled
in
her
hardness
contempt
a
kindly
forgiving
contempt
that
was
the
kernel
of
the
sympathy
which
exteriorly
warmed
her
contempt
for
the
lack
of
which
had
resulted
in
this
swift
degeneration
of
a
man
into
a
tortured
victim
contempt
for
the
lack
of
perspective
which
magnified
a
mere
mushroom
passion
till
it
filled
the
whole
field
of
life
contempt
for
this
feminine
slavery
to
sentiment
she
felt
that
she
might
have
been
able
to
give
herself
to
chirac
as
one
gives
a
toy
to
an
infant
but
of
loving
him
no
she
was
conscious
of
an
immeasurable
superiority
to
him
for
she
was
conscious
of
the
freedom
of
a
strong
mind
i
wanted
to
tell
you
said
he
i
am
going
away
where
she
asked
out
of
paris
out
of
paris
how
by
balloon
my
journal
it
is
an
affair
of
great
importance
you
understand
i
offered
myself
what
would
you
it
is
dangerous
she
observed
waiting
to
see
if
he
would
put
on
the
silly
air
of
one
who
does
not
understand
fear
oh
the
poor
fellow
muttered
with
a
fatuous
intonation
and
snapping
of
the
fingers
that
is
all
the
same
to
me
yes
it
is
dangerous
yes
it
is
dangerous
he
repeated
but
what
would
you
for
me
she
wished
that
she
had
not
mentioned
danger
it
hurt
her
to
watch
him
incurring
her
ironic
disdain
it
will
be
the
night
after
he
said
in
the
courtyard
of
the
gare
du
nord
i
want
you
to
come
and
see
me
go
i
particularly
want
you
to
come
and
see
me
go
i
have
asked
carlier
to
escort
you
he
might
have
been
saying
i
am
offering
myself
to
martyrdom
and
you
must
assist
at
the
spectacle
she
despised
him
yet
more
oh
be
tranquil
he
said
i
shall
not
worry
you
never
shall
i
speak
to
you
again
of
my
love
i
know
you
i
know
it
would
be
useless
but
i
hope
you
will
come
and
wish
me
bon
voyage
of
course
if
you
really
wish
it
she
replied
with
cheerful
coolness
he
seized
her
hand
and
kissed
it
once
it
had
pleased
her
when
he
kissed
her
hand
but
now
she
did
not
like
it
it
seemed
hysterical
and
foolish
to
her
she
felt
her
feet
to
be
on
the
floor
i
leave
you
now
she
said
please
eat
your
soup
she
escaped
hoping
he
would
not
espy
her
feet
ii
the
courtyard
of
the
nord
railway
station
was
lighted
by
taken
from
locomotives
their
silvered
reflectors
threw
dazzling
rays
from
all
sides
on
the
under
portion
of
the
immense
yellow
mass
of
the
balloon
the
upper
portion
was
swaying
to
and
fro
with
gigantic
ungainliness
in
the
strong
breeze
it
was
only
a
small
balloon
as
balloons
are
measured
but
it
seemed
monstrous
as
it
wavered
over
the
human
forms
that
were
agitating
themselves
beneath
it
the
cordage
was
silhouetted
against
the
yellow
taffetas
as
high
up
as
the
widest
diameter
of
the
balloon
but
above
that
all
was
vague
and
even
spectators
standing
at
a
distance
could
not
clearly
separate
the
summit
of
the
great
sphere
from
the
darkly
moving
sky
the
car
held
by
ropes
fastened
to
stakes
rose
now
and
then
a
few
inches
uneasily
from
the
ground
the
sombre
and
severe
architecture
of
the
enclosed
the
balloon
on
every
hand
it
had
only
one
way
of
escape
over
the
roofs
of
that
architecture
which
shut
out
the
sounds
of
the
city
came
the
irregular
booming
of
the
bombardment
shells
were
falling
in
the
southern
quarters
of
paris
doing
perhaps
not
a
great
deal
of
damage
but
still
plunging
occasionally
into
the
midst
of
some
domestic
interior
and
making
a
sad
mess
of
it
the
parisians
were
convinced
that
the
shells
were
aimed
maliciously
at
hospitals
and
museums
and
when
a
child
happened
to
be
blown
to
pieces
their
unspoken
comments
upon
the
prussian
savagery
were
bitter
their
faces
said
those
barbarians
can
not
even
spare
our
children
they
amused
themselves
by
creating
a
market
in
shells
paying
more
for
a
live
shell
than
a
dead
one
and
modifying
the
tariff
according
to
the
supply
and
as
the
was
empty
and
the
was
empty
and
beasts
no
longer
pastured
on
the
grass
of
the
parks
and
the
million
rats
of
the
metropolis
were
too
numerous
to
furnish
interest
to
spectators
and
the
bourse
was
practically
deserted
the
traffic
in
shells
sustained
the
starving
mercantile
instinct
during
a
very
dull
period
but
the
effect
on
the
nerves
was
deleterious
the
nerves
of
everybody
were
like
nothing
but
a
raw
wound
violent
anger
would
spring
up
magically
out
of
laughter
and
blows
out
of
caresses
this
indirect
consequence
of
the
bombardment
was
particularly
noticeable
in
the
group
of
men
under
the
balloon
each
behaved
as
if
he
were
controlling
his
temper
in
the
most
difficult
circumstances
constantly
they
all
gazed
upwards
into
the
sky
though
nothing
could
possibly
be
distinguished
there
save
the
blurred
edge
of
a
flying
cloud
but
the
booming
came
from
that
sky
the
shells
that
were
dropping
on
montrouge
came
out
of
that
sky
and
the
balloon
was
going
up
into
it
the
balloon
was
ascending
into
its
mysteries
to
brave
its
dangers
to
sweep
over
the
encircling
ring
of
fire
and
savages
sophia
stood
apart
with
carlier
carlier
had
indicated
a
particular
spot
under
the
shelter
of
the
colonnade
where
he
said
it
was
imperative
that
they
should
post
themselves
having
guided
sophia
to
this
spot
and
impressed
upon
her
that
they
were
not
to
move
he
seemed
to
consider
that
the
activity
of
his
role
was
finished
and
spoke
no
word
with
the
very
high
silk
hat
which
he
always
wore
and
a
thin
overcoat
whose
collar
was
turned
up
he
made
a
rather
grotesque
figure
fortunately
the
night
was
not
very
cold
or
he
might
have
passively
frozen
to
death
on
the
edge
of
that
feverish
group
sophia
soon
ignored
him
she
watched
the
balloon
an
aristocratic
old
man
leaned
against
the
car
watch
in
hand
at
intervals
he
scowled
or
stamped
his
foot
an
old
sailor
tranquilly
smoking
a
pipe
walked
round
and
round
the
balloon
staring
at
it
once
he
climbed
up
into
the
rigging
and
once
he
jumped
into
the
car
and
angrily
threw
out
of
it
a
bag
which
some
one
had
placed
in
it
but
for
the
most
part
he
was
calm
other
persons
of
authority
hurried
about
talking
and
gesticulating
and
a
number
of
workmen
waited
idly
for
orders
where
is
chirac
suddenly
cried
the
old
man
with
the
watch
several
voices
deferentially
answered
and
a
man
ran
away
into
the
gloom
on
an
errand
then
chirac
appeared
nervous
restless
he
was
enveloped
in
a
fur
coat
that
sophia
had
never
seen
before
and
he
carried
dangling
in
his
hand
a
cage
containing
six
pigeons
whose
whiteness
stirred
uneasily
within
it
the
sailor
took
the
cage
from
him
and
all
the
persons
of
authority
gathered
round
to
inspect
the
wonderful
birds
upon
which
apparently
momentous
affairs
depended
when
the
group
separated
the
sailor
was
to
be
seen
bending
over
the
edge
of
the
car
to
deposit
the
cage
safely
he
then
got
into
the
car
still
smoking
his
pipe
and
perched
himself
negligently
on
the
the
man
with
the
watch
was
conversing
with
chirac
chirac
nodded
his
head
frequently
in
acquiescence
and
seemed
to
be
saying
all
the
time
yes
sir
perfectly
sir
i
understand
sir
yes
sir
suddenly
chirac
turned
to
the
car
and
put
a
question
to
the
sailor
who
shook
his
head
whereupon
chirac
gave
a
gesture
of
submissive
despair
to
the
man
with
the
watch
and
in
an
instant
the
whole
throng
was
in
a
ferment
the
victuals
cried
the
man
with
the
watch
the
victuals
name
of
god
must
one
be
indeed
an
idiot
to
forget
the
victuals
name
of
god
of
god
sophia
smiled
at
the
agitation
and
at
the
inefficient
management
which
had
never
thought
of
food
for
it
appeared
that
the
food
had
not
merely
been
forgotten
it
was
a
question
which
had
not
even
been
considered
she
could
not
help
despising
all
that
crowd
of
and
fussy
males
to
whom
the
idea
had
not
occurred
that
even
balloonists
must
eat
and
she
wondered
whether
everything
was
done
like
that
after
a
delay
that
seemed
very
long
the
problem
of
victuals
was
solved
chiefly
as
far
as
sophia
could
judge
by
means
of
cakes
of
chocolate
and
bottles
of
wine
it
is
enough
it
is
enough
chirac
shouted
passionately
several
times
to
a
knot
of
men
who
began
to
argue
with
him
then
he
gazed
round
furtively
and
with
an
inflation
of
the
chest
and
a
patting
of
his
fur
coat
he
came
directly
towards
sophia
evidently
sophia
position
had
been
prearranged
between
him
and
carlier
they
could
forget
food
but
they
could
think
of
sophia
position
all
eyes
followed
him
those
eyes
could
not
in
the
gloom
distinguish
sophia
beauty
but
they
could
see
that
she
was
young
and
slim
and
elegant
and
of
foreign
carriage
that
was
enough
the
very
air
seemed
to
vibrate
with
the
intense
curiosity
of
those
eyes
and
immediately
chirac
grew
into
the
hero
of
some
brilliant
and
romantic
adventure
immediately
he
was
envied
and
admired
by
every
man
of
authority
present
what
was
she
who
was
she
was
it
a
serious
passion
or
simply
a
caprice
had
she
flung
herself
at
him
it
was
undeniable
that
lovely
creatures
did
sometimes
fling
themselves
at
lucky
mediocrities
was
she
a
married
woman
an
artiste
a
girl
such
queries
thumped
beneath
overcoats
while
the
correctness
of
a
ceremonious
demeanour
was
strictly
observed
chirac
uncovered
and
kissed
her
hand
the
wind
disarranged
his
hair
she
saw
that
his
face
was
very
pale
and
anxious
beneath
the
swagger
of
a
sincere
desire
to
be
brave
well
it
is
the
moment
he
said
did
you
all
forget
the
food
she
asked
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
will
you
one
can
not
think
of
everything
i
hope
you
will
have
a
safe
voyage
she
said
she
had
already
taken
leave
of
him
once
in
the
house
and
heard
all
about
the
balloon
and
the
and
the
preparations
and
now
she
had
nothing
to
say
nothing
whatever
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
again
i
hope
so
he
murmured
but
in
a
tone
to
convey
that
he
had
no
such
hope
the
wind
is
too
strong
she
suggested
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
again
what
would
you
is
it
in
the
direction
you
want
yes
nearly
he
admitted
unwillingly
then
rousing
himself
eh
well
madame
you
have
been
extremely
amiable
to
come
i
held
to
it
very
much
that
you
should
come
it
is
because
of
you
i
quit
paris
she
resented
the
speech
by
a
frown
ah
he
implored
in
a
whisper
do
not
do
that
smile
on
me
after
all
it
is
not
my
fault
remember
that
this
may
be
the
last
time
i
see
you
the
last
time
i
regard
your
eyes
she
smiled
she
was
convinced
of
the
genuineness
of
the
emotion
which
expressed
itself
in
all
this
flamboyant
behaviour
and
she
had
to
make
excuses
to
herself
on
behalf
of
chirac
she
smiled
to
give
him
pleasure
the
hard
commonsense
in
her
might
sneer
but
indubitably
she
was
the
centre
of
a
romantic
episode
the
balloon
darkly
swinging
there
the
men
waiting
the
secrecy
of
the
mission
and
chirac
in
the
wind
that
was
to
whisk
him
away
telling
her
in
fatalistic
accents
that
her
image
had
devastated
his
life
while
envious
aspirants
watched
their
colloquy
yes
it
was
romantic
and
she
was
beautiful
her
beauty
was
an
active
reality
that
went
about
the
world
playing
tricks
in
spite
of
herself
the
thoughts
that
passed
through
her
mind
were
the
large
splendid
thoughts
of
romance
and
it
was
chirac
who
had
aroused
them
a
real
drama
existed
then
triumphing
over
the
accidental
absurdities
and
pettinesses
of
the
situation
her
final
words
to
chirac
were
tender
and
encouraging
he
hurried
back
to
the
balloon
resuming
his
cap
he
was
received
with
the
respect
due
to
one
who
comes
fresh
from
conquest
he
was
sacred
sophia
rejoined
carlier
who
had
withdrawn
and
began
to
talk
to
him
with
a
garrulity
she
spoke
without
reason
and
scarcely
noticed
what
she
was
saying
already
chirac
was
snatched
out
of
her
life
as
other
beings
so
many
of
them
had
been
snatched
she
thought
of
their
first
meetings
and
of
the
sympathy
which
had
always
united
them
he
had
lost
his
simplicity
now
in
the
crisis
of
his
fate
and
had
sunk
in
her
esteem
and
she
was
determined
to
like
him
all
the
more
because
he
had
sunk
in
her
esteem
she
wondered
whether
he
really
had
undertaken
this
adventure
from
sentimental
disappointment
she
wondered
whether
if
she
had
not
forgotten
to
wind
her
watch
one
night
they
would
still
have
been
living
quietly
under
the
same
roof
in
the
rue
breda
the
sailor
climbed
definitely
into
the
car
he
had
covered
himself
with
a
large
cloak
chirac
had
got
one
leg
over
the
side
of
the
car
and
eight
men
were
standing
by
the
ropes
when
a
horse
hoofs
clattered
through
the
guarded
entrance
to
the
courtyard
amid
an
uproar
of
sudden
excitement
the
shiny
chest
of
the
horse
was
flecked
with
the
classic
foam
a
telegram
from
the
governor
of
paris
as
the
orderly
checking
his
mount
approached
the
group
even
the
old
man
with
the
watch
raised
his
hat
the
orderly
responded
bent
down
to
make
an
inquiry
which
chirac
answered
and
then
with
another
exchange
of
salutes
the
official
telegram
was
handed
over
to
chirac
and
the
horse
backed
away
from
the
crowd
it
was
quite
thrilling
carlier
was
thrilled
he
is
never
too
prompt
the
governor
it
is
a
quality
said
carlier
with
irony
chirac
entered
the
car
and
then
the
old
man
with
the
watch
drew
a
black
bag
from
the
shadow
behind
him
and
entrusted
it
to
chirac
who
accepted
it
with
a
profound
deference
and
hid
it
the
sailor
began
to
issue
commands
the
men
at
the
ropes
were
bending
down
now
suddenly
the
balloon
rose
about
a
foot
and
trembled
the
sailor
continued
to
shout
all
the
persons
of
authority
gazed
motionless
at
the
balloon
the
moment
of
suspense
was
eternal
let
go
all
cried
the
sailor
standing
up
and
clinging
to
the
cordage
chirac
was
seated
in
the
car
a
mass
of
dark
fur
with
a
small
patch
of
white
in
it
the
men
at
the
ropes
were
a
knot
of
struggling
confused
figures
one
side
of
the
car
tilted
up
and
the
sailor
was
nearly
pitched
out
three
men
at
the
other
side
had
failed
to
free
the
ropes
let
go
corpses
the
sailor
yelled
at
them
the
balloon
jumped
as
if
it
were
drawn
by
some
terrific
impulse
from
the
skies
adieu
called
chirac
pulling
his
cap
off
and
waving
it
adieu
bon
voyage
bon
voyage
the
little
crowd
cheered
and
then
vive
la
france
throats
tightened
including
sophia
but
the
top
of
the
balloon
had
leaned
over
destroying
its
and
the
whole
mass
swerved
violently
towards
the
wall
of
the
station
the
car
swinging
under
it
like
a
toy
and
an
anchor
under
the
car
there
was
a
cry
of
alarm
then
the
great
ball
leaped
again
and
swept
over
the
high
glass
roof
escaping
by
inches
the
spouting
the
cheers
expired
instantly
the
balloon
was
gone
it
was
spirited
away
as
if
by
some
furious
and
mighty
power
that
had
grown
impatient
in
waiting
for
it
there
remained
for
a
few
seconds
on
the
collective
retina
of
the
spectators
a
vision
of
the
inclined
car
swinging
near
the
roof
like
the
tail
of
a
kite
and
then
nothing
blankness
blackness
already
the
balloon
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
vast
stormy
ocean
of
the
night
a
plaything
of
the
winds
the
spectators
became
once
more
aware
of
the
dull
booming
of
the
cannonade
the
balloon
was
already
perhaps
flying
unseen
amid
the
wrack
over
those
guns
sophia
involuntarily
caught
her
breath
a
chill
sense
of
loneliness
of
purposelessness
numbed
her
being
nobody
ever
saw
chirac
or
the
old
sailor
again
the
sea
must
have
swallowed
them
of
the
balloons
that
left
paris
during
the
siege
two
were
not
heard
of
this
was
the
first
of
the
two
chirac
had
at
any
rate
not
magnified
the
peril
though
his
intention
was
undoubtedly
to
magnify
it
iii
this
was
the
end
of
sophia
romantic
adventures
in
france
soon
afterwards
the
germans
entered
paris
by
mutual
agreement
and
made
a
point
of
seeing
the
louvre
and
departed
amid
the
silence
of
a
city
for
sophia
the
conclusion
of
the
siege
meant
chiefly
that
prices
went
down
long
before
supplies
from
outside
could
reach
paris
the
were
suddenly
full
of
goods
which
had
arrived
from
the
shopkeepers
alone
knew
where
sophia
with
the
stock
in
her
cellar
could
have
held
out
for
several
weeks
more
and
it
annoyed
her
that
she
had
not
sold
more
of
her
good
things
while
good
things
were
worth
gold
the
signing
of
a
treaty
at
versailles
reduced
the
value
of
sophia
two
remaining
hams
from
about
five
pounds
apiece
to
the
usual
price
of
hams
however
at
the
end
of
january
she
found
herself
in
possession
of
a
capital
of
about
eight
thousand
francs
all
the
furniture
of
the
flat
and
a
reputation
she
had
earned
it
all
nothing
could
destroy
the
structure
of
her
beauty
but
she
looked
worn
and
appreciably
older
she
wondered
often
when
chirac
would
return
she
might
have
written
to
carlier
or
to
the
paper
but
she
did
not
it
was
niepce
who
discovered
in
a
newspaper
that
chirac
balloon
had
miscarried
at
the
moment
the
news
did
not
affect
her
at
all
but
after
several
days
she
began
to
feel
her
loss
in
a
dull
sort
of
way
and
she
felt
it
more
and
more
though
never
acutely
she
was
perfectly
convinced
that
chirac
could
never
have
attracted
her
powerfully
she
continued
to
dream
at
rare
intervals
of
the
kind
of
passion
that
would
have
satisfied
her
glowing
but
banked
down
like
a
fire
in
some
fine
chamber
of
a
rich
but
careful
household
she
was
speculating
upon
what
her
future
would
be
and
whether
by
inertia
she
was
doomed
to
stay
for
ever
in
the
rue
breda
when
the
commune
caught
her
she
was
more
vexed
than
frightened
by
the
commune
vexed
that
a
city
so
in
need
of
repose
and
industry
should
indulge
in
such
antics
for
many
people
the
commune
was
a
worse
experience
than
the
siege
but
not
for
sophia
she
was
a
woman
and
a
foreigner
niepce
was
infinitely
more
disturbed
than
sophia
he
went
in
fear
of
his
life
sophia
would
go
out
to
market
and
take
her
chances
it
is
true
that
during
one
period
the
whole
population
of
the
house
went
to
live
in
the
cellars
and
orders
to
the
butcher
and
other
tradesmen
were
given
over
the
into
the
adjoining
courtyard
which
communicated
with
an
alley
a
strange
existence
and
possibly
perilous
but
the
women
who
passed
through
it
and
had
also
passed
through
the
siege
were
not
very
much
intimidated
by
it
unless
they
happened
to
have
husbands
or
lovers
who
were
active
politicians
sophia
did
not
cease
during
the
greater
part
of
the
year
to
make
a
living
and
to
save
money
she
watched
every
sou
and
she
developed
a
tendency
to
demand
from
her
tenants
all
that
they
could
pay
she
excused
this
to
herself
by
ostentatiously
declaring
every
detail
of
her
prices
in
advance
it
came
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
with
this
advantage
that
the
bills
did
not
lead
to
unpleasantness
her
difficulties
commenced
when
paris
at
last
definitely
resumed
its
normal
aspect
and
life
when
all
the
women
and
children
came
back
to
those
city
termini
which
they
had
left
in
such
huddled
hysterical
throngs
when
flats
were
that
had
long
been
shut
and
men
who
for
a
whole
year
had
had
the
disadvantages
and
the
advantages
of
being
without
wife
and
family
anchored
themselves
once
more
to
the
hearth
then
it
was
that
sophia
failed
to
keep
all
her
rooms
let
she
could
have
let
them
easily
and
constantly
and
at
high
rents
but
not
to
men
without
encumbrances
nearly
every
day
she
refused
attractive
tenants
in
pretty
hats
or
agreeable
gentlemen
who
only
wanted
a
room
on
condition
that
they
might
offer
hospitality
to
a
dashing
petticoat
it
was
useless
to
proclaim
aloud
that
her
house
was
the
ambition
of
the
majority
of
these
joyous
persons
was
to
live
in
a
house
because
each
was
sure
that
at
bottom
he
or
she
was
a
person
and
quite
different
from
the
rest
of
the
joyous
world
the
character
of
sophia
flat
instead
of
repelling
the
wrong
kind
of
aspirant
infallibly
drew
just
that
kind
hope
was
inextinguishable
in
these
bosoms
they
heard
that
there
would
be
no
chance
for
them
at
sophia
but
they
tried
nevertheless
and
occasionally
sophia
would
make
a
mistake
and
grave
unpleasantness
would
occur
before
the
mistake
could
be
rectified
the
fact
was
that
the
street
was
too
much
for
her
few
people
would
credit
that
there
was
a
serious
in
the
rue
breda
the
police
themselves
would
not
credit
it
and
sophia
beauty
was
against
her
at
that
time
the
rue
breda
was
perhaps
the
most
notorious
street
in
the
centre
of
paris
at
the
height
of
its
reputation
as
a
warren
of
individual
improprieties
most
busily
creating
that
prejudice
against
itself
which
over
thirty
years
later
forced
the
authorities
to
change
its
name
in
obedience
to
the
wish
of
its
tradesmen
when
sophia
went
out
at
about
eleven
in
the
morning
with
her
reticule
to
buy
the
street
was
littered
with
women
who
had
gone
out
with
reticules
to
buy
but
whereas
sophia
was
fully
dressed
and
wore
headgear
the
others
were
in
and
slippers
or
and
slippers
having
slid
directly
out
of
unspeakable
beds
and
omitted
to
brush
their
hair
out
of
their
puffy
eyes
in
the
little
shops
of
the
rue
breda
the
rue
notre
dame
de
lorette
and
the
rue
des
martyrs
you
were
very
close
indeed
to
the
primitive
instincts
of
human
nature
it
was
wonderful
it
was
amusing
it
was
excitingly
picturesque
and
the
universality
of
the
manners
rendered
moral
indignation
absurd
but
the
neighbourhood
was
certainly
not
one
in
which
a
woman
of
sophia
race
training
and
character
could
comfortably
earn
a
living
or
even
exist
she
could
not
fight
against
the
entire
street
she
and
not
the
street
was
out
of
place
and
in
the
wrong
little
wonder
that
the
neighbours
lifted
their
shoulders
when
they
spoke
of
her
what
beautiful
woman
but
a
mad
englishwoman
would
have
had
the
idea
of
establishing
herself
in
the
rue
breda
with
the
intention
of
living
like
a
nun
and
compelling
others
to
do
the
same
by
dint
of
continual
ingenuity
sophia
contrived
to
win
somewhat
more
than
her
expenses
but
she
was
slowly
driven
to
admit
to
herself
that
the
situation
could
not
last
then
one
day
she
saw
in
galignani
messenger
an
advertisement
of
an
english
pension
for
sale
in
the
rue
lord
byron
in
the
champs
elysees
quarter
it
belonged
to
some
people
named
frensham
and
had
enjoyed
a
certain
popularity
before
the
war
the
proprietor
and
his
wife
however
had
not
sufficiently
allowed
for
the
vicissitudes
of
politics
in
paris
instead
of
saving
money
during
their
popularity
they
had
put
it
on
the
back
and
on
the
fingers
of
frensham
the
siege
and
the
commune
had
almost
ruined
them
with
capital
they
might
have
restored
themselves
to
their
former
pride
but
their
capital
was
exhausted
sophia
answered
the
advertisement
she
impressed
the
frenshams
who
were
delighted
with
the
prospect
of
dealing
in
business
with
an
honest
english
face
like
many
english
people
abroad
they
were
most
strangely
obsessed
by
the
notion
that
they
had
quitted
an
island
of
honest
men
to
live
among
thieves
and
robbers
they
always
implied
that
dishonesty
was
unknown
in
britain
they
offered
if
she
would
take
over
the
lease
to
sell
all
their
furniture
and
their
renown
for
ten
thousand
francs
she
declined
the
price
seeming
absurd
to
her
when
they
asked
her
to
name
a
price
she
said
that
she
preferred
not
to
do
so
upon
entreaty
she
said
four
thousand
francs
they
then
allowed
her
to
see
that
they
considered
her
to
have
been
quite
right
in
hesitating
to
name
a
price
so
ridiculous
and
their
confidence
in
the
honest
english
face
seemed
to
have
been
shocked
sophia
left
when
she
got
back
to
the
rue
breda
she
was
relieved
that
the
matter
had
come
to
nothing
she
did
not
precisely
foresee
what
her
future
was
to
be
but
at
any
rate
she
knew
she
shrank
from
the
responsibility
of
the
pension
frensham
the
next
morning
she
received
a
letter
offering
to
accept
six
thousand
she
wrote
and
declined
she
was
indifferent
and
she
would
not
budge
from
four
thousand
the
frenshams
gave
way
they
were
pained
but
they
gave
way
the
glitter
of
four
thousand
francs
in
cash
and
freedom
was
too
tempting
thus
sophia
became
the
proprietress
of
the
pension
frensham
in
the
cold
and
correct
rue
lord
byron
she
made
room
in
it
for
nearly
all
her
other
furniture
so
that
instead
of
being
as
pensions
usually
are
it
was
she
was
extremely
timid
at
first
for
the
rent
alone
was
four
thousand
francs
a
year
and
the
prices
of
the
quarter
were
alarmingly
different
from
those
of
the
rue
breda
she
lost
a
lot
of
sleep
for
some
nights
after
she
had
been
installed
in
the
rue
lord
byron
about
a
fortnight
she
scarcely
slept
at
all
and
she
ate
no
more
than
she
slept
she
cut
down
expenditure
to
the
very
lowest
and
frequently
walked
over
to
the
rue
breda
to
do
her
marketing
with
the
aid
of
a
charwoman
at
six
sous
an
hour
she
accomplished
everything
and
though
clients
were
few
the
feat
was
in
the
nature
of
a
miracle
for
sophia
had
to
cook
the
articles
which
george
augustus
sala
wrote
under
the
title
paris
herself
again
ought
to
have
been
paid
for
in
gold
by
the
hotel
and
of
paris
they
awakened
english
curiosity
and
the
desire
to
witness
the
scene
of
terrible
events
their
effect
was
immediately
noticeable
in
less
than
a
year
after
her
adventurous
purchase
sophia
had
acquired
confidence
and
she
was
employing
two
servants
working
them
very
hard
at
low
wages
she
had
also
acquired
the
landlady
manner
she
was
known
as
frensham
across
the
balconies
of
two
windows
the
frenshams
had
left
a
gilded
sign
pension
frensham
and
sophia
had
not
removed
it
she
often
explained
that
her
name
was
not
frensham
but
in
vain
every
visitor
inevitably
and
persistently
addressed
her
according
to
the
sign
it
was
past
the
general
comprehension
that
the
proprietress
of
the
pension
frensham
might
bear
another
name
than
frensham
but
later
there
came
into
being
a
class
of
persons
habitues
of
the
pension
frensham
who
knew
the
real
name
of
the
proprietress
and
were
proud
of
knowing
it
and
by
this
knowledge
were
distinguished
from
the
herd
what
struck
sophia
was
the
astounding
similarity
of
her
guests
they
all
asked
the
same
questions
made
the
same
exclamations
went
out
on
the
same
excursions
returned
with
the
same
judgments
and
exhibited
the
same
unimpaired
assurance
that
foreigners
were
really
very
peculiar
people
they
never
seemed
to
advance
in
knowledge
there
was
a
constant
stream
of
explorers
from
england
who
had
to
be
set
on
their
way
to
the
louvre
or
the
bon
marche
sophia
sole
interest
was
in
her
profits
the
excellence
of
her
house
was
firmly
established
she
kept
it
up
and
she
kept
the
modest
prices
up
often
she
had
to
refuse
guests
she
naturally
did
so
with
a
certain
distant
condescension
her
manner
to
guests
increased
in
stiff
formality
and
she
was
excessively
firm
with
undesirables
she
grew
to
be
seriously
convinced
that
no
pension
as
good
as
hers
existed
in
the
world
or
ever
had
existed
or
ever
could
exist
hers
was
the
acme
of
niceness
and
respectability
her
preference
for
the
respectable
rose
to
a
passion
and
there
were
no
faults
in
her
establishment
even
the
once
despised
showy
furniture
of
madame
foucault
had
mysteriously
changed
into
the
best
conceivable
furniture
and
its
cracks
were
hallowed
she
never
heard
a
word
of
gerald
nor
of
her
family
in
the
thousands
of
people
who
stayed
under
her
perfect
roof
not
one
mentioned
bursley
nor
disclosed
a
knowledge
of
anybody
that
sophia
had
known
several
men
had
the
wit
to
propose
marriage
to
her
with
more
or
less
skilfulness
but
none
of
them
was
skilful
enough
to
perturb
her
heart
she
had
forgotten
the
face
of
love
she
was
a
landlady
she
was
the
landlady
efficient
stylish
diplomatic
and
tremendously
experienced
there
was
no
trickery
no
baseness
of
parisian
life
that
she
was
not
acquainted
with
and
armed
against
she
could
not
be
startled
and
she
could
not
be
swindled
years
passed
until
there
was
a
vista
of
years
behind
her
sometimes
she
would
think
in
an
unoccupied
moment
how
strange
it
is
that
i
should
be
here
doing
what
i
am
doing
but
the
regular
ordinariness
of
her
existence
would
instantly
seize
her
again
at
the
end
of
the
exhibition
year
her
pension
consisted
of
two
floors
instead
of
one
and
she
had
turned
the
two
hundred
pounds
stolen
from
gerald
into
over
two
thousand

matthew
sat
in
the
long
of
the
pension
frensham
rue
lord
byron
paris
and
he
looked
out
of
place
there
it
was
an
apartment
about
thirty
feet
in
length
and
of
the
width
of
two
windows
which
sufficiently
lighted
one
half
of
a
very
long
table
with
round
ends
the
gloom
of
the
other
extremity
was
illumined
by
a
large
mirror
in
a
tarnished
gilt
frame
which
filled
a
good
portion
of
the
wall
opposite
the
windows
near
the
mirror
was
a
high
of
four
leaves
and
behind
this
screen
could
be
heard
the
sound
of
a
door
continually
shutting
and
opening
in
the
long
wall
to
the
left
of
the
windows
were
two
doors
one
dark
and
important
a
door
of
state
through
which
a
procession
of
hungry
and
a
procession
of
sated
solemn
persons
passed
twice
daily
and
the
other
a
smaller
door
glazed
its
glass
painted
with
wreaths
of
roses
not
an
original
door
of
the
house
but
a
late
breach
in
the
wall
that
seemed
to
lead
to
the
dangerous
and
to
the
naughty
the
and
the
window

were
rich
and
forbidding
dark
in

of

at
intervals
so
high

as
to
defy

engravings
and
made
oblong
patches
on
the
walls
they
were
hung
from
immense
nails
with
porcelain
heads
and
they
appeared
to
depict
the
more
majestic
aspect
of
man
and
nature
one
engraving
over
the
mantelpiece
and
nearer
earth
than
the
rest
unmistakably
showed
louis
philippe
and
his
family
in
attitudes
of
virtue
beneath
this
royal
group
a
vast
gilt
clock
flanked
by
pendants
of
the
same
period
gave
the
right
time
a
quarter
past
seven
and
down
the
room
filling
it
ran
the
great
white
table
bordered
with
bowed
heads
and
the
backs
of
chairs
there
were
over
thirty
people
at
the
table
and
the
peculiarly
restrained
noisiness
of
their
knives
and
forks
on
the
plates
proved
that
they
were
a
discreet
and
a
correct
people
their
clothes
blouses
bodices
and
jackets
did
not
flatter
the
lust
of
the
eye
only
two
or
three
were
in
evening
dress
they
spoke
little
and
generally
in
a
timorous
tone
as
though
silence
had
been
enjoined
somebody
would
a
remark
and
then
his
neighbour
absently
fingering
her
bread
and
lifting
gaze
from
her
plate
into
vacancy
would
conscientiously
weigh
the
remark
and
in
reply
i
dare
say
but
a
few
spoke
loudly
and
volubly
and
were
regarded
by
the
rest
who
envied
them
as
underbred
food
was
quite
properly
the
chief
preoccupation
the
diners
ate
as
those
eat
who
are
paying
a
fixed
price
per
day
for
as
much
as
they
can
consume
while
observing
the
rules
of
the
game
without
moving
their
heads
they
glanced
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
watching
the
manoeuvres
of
the
three
starched
maids
who
served
they
had
no
conception
of
food
save
as
portions
laid
out
in
rows
on
large
silver
dishes
and
when
a
maid
bent
over
them
deferentially
balancing
the
dish
they
summed
up
the
offering
in
an
instant
and
in
an
instant
decided
how
much
they
could
decently
take
and
to
what
extent
they
could
practise
the
theoretic
liberty
of
choice
and
if
the
food
for
any
reason
did
not
tempt
them
or
if
it
egregiously
failed
to
coincide
with
their
aspirations
they
considered
themselves
aggrieved
for
according
to
the
game
they
might
not
command
they
had
the
right
to
seize
all
that
was
presented
under
their
noses
like
genteel
tigers
and
they
had
the
right
to
refuse
that
was
all
the
dinner
was
thus
a
series
of
emotional
crises
for
the
diners
who
knew
only
that
full
dishes
and
clean
plates
came
endlessly
from
the
banging
door
behind
the
screen
and
that
ravaged
dishes
and
dirty
plates
vanished
endlessly
through
the
same
door
they
were
all
eating
similar
food
simultaneously
they
began
together
and
they
finished
together
the
flies
that
haunted
the
which
hung
from
the
chandeliers
to
the
level
of
the
were
more
free
the
sole
event
that
chequered
the
exact
regularity
of
the
repast
was
the
occasional
arrival
of
a
for
one
of
the
guests
the
receiver
of
the
signed
a
small
paper
in
exchange
for
it
and
wrote
largely
a
number
on
the
label
of
the
bottle
then
staring
at
the
number
and
fearing
that
after
all
it
might
be
misread
by
a
stupid
maid
or
an
unscrupulous
compeer
he
would
the
number
on
another
part
of
the
label
even
more
largely
matthew
obviously
did
not
belong
to
this
world
he
was
a
young
man
of
or
so
not
handsome
but
elegant
though
he
was
not
in
evening
dress
though
he
was
as
a
fact
in
a
very
light
grey
suit
entirely
improper
to
a
dinner
he
was
elegant
the
suit
was
admirably
cut
and
nearly
new
but
he
wore
it
as
though
he
had
never
worn
anything
else
also
his
demeanour
reserved
yet
free
from
his
method
of
handling
a
knife
and
fork
the
niceties
of
his
manner
in
transferring
food
from
the
silver
dishes
to
his
plate
the
tone
in
which
he
ordered
half
a
bottle
of
wine
all
these
details
infallibly
indicated
to
the
company
that
matthew
was
their
superior
some
folks
hoped
that
he
was
the
son
of
a
lord
or
even
a
lord
he
happened
to
be
fixed
at
the
end
of
the
table
with
his
back
to
the
window
and
there
was
a
vacant
chair
on
either
side
of
him
this
situation
favoured
the
hope
of
his
high
rank
in
truth
he
was
the
son
the
grandson
and
several
times
the
nephew
of
earthenware
manufacturers
he
noticed
that
the
large
as
it
was
called
in
his
trade
which
marked
the
centre
of
the
table
was
the
production
of
his
firm
this
surprised
him
for
peel
swynnerton
and
known
and
revered
throughout
the
five
towns
as
did
not
cater
for
cheap
markets
a
late
guest
startled
the
room
a
fat
flabby
man
whose
nose
would
have
roused
the
provisional
hostility
of
those
who
have
convinced
themselves
that
jews
are
not
as
other
men
his
nose
did
not
definitely
brand
him
as
a
usurer
and
a
murderer
of
christ
but
it
was
suspicious
his
clothes
hung
loose
and
might
have
been
anybody
clothes
he
advanced
with
brisk
assurance
to
the
table
bowed
somewhat
too
effusively
to
several
people
and
sat
down
next
to
one
of
the
maids
at
once
brought
him
a
plate
of
soup
and
he
said
thank
you
marie
smiling
at
her
he
was
evidently
a
habitue
of
the
house
his
spectacled
eyes
beamed
the
superiority
which
comes
of
knowing
girls
by
their
names
he
was
seriously
handicapped
in
the
race
for
sustenance
being
two
and
a
half
courses
behind
but
he
drew
level
with
speed
and
then
having
accomplished
this
he
sighed
and
pointedly
engaged
with
his
sociable
glance
ah
he
breathed
out
nuisance
when
you
come
in
late
sir
gave
a
reluctant
affirmative
does
only
upset
you
it
upsets
the
house
servants
do
like
it
no
murmured
i
suppose
not
however
it
not
often
late
said
the
man
ca
help
it
sometimes
business
worst
of
these
french
business
people
is
that
they
no
notion
of
time
appointments
god
bless
my
soul
do
you
come
here
often
asked
he
detested
the
fellow
quite
inexcusably
perhaps
because
his
serviette
was
tucked
under
his
chin
but
he
saw
that
the
fellow
was
one
of
your
determined
talkers
who
always
win
in
the
end
moreover
as
being
clearly
not
an
ordinary
tourist
in
paris
the
fellow
mildly
excited
his
curiosity
i
live
here
said
the
other
very
convenient
for
a
bachelor
you
know
have
done
for
years
my
office
is
just
close
by
you
may
know
my
name
lewis
mardon
hesitated
the
hesitation
convicted
him
of
not
his
paris
well
said
lewis
mardon
quickly
oh
yes
said
vaguely
recalling
a
vision
of
the
name
among
the
advertisements
on
newspaper
kiosks
i
expect
mardon
went
on
my
name
is
as
as
in
paris
i
suppose
so
assented
the
conversation
fell
for
a
few
moments
staying
here
long
mardon
demanded
having
added
up
as
a
man
of
style
and
of
means
and
being
puzzled
by
his
presence
at
that
table
i
do
know
said
this
was
a
lie
justified
in
the
utterer
opinion
as
a
repulse
to
mardon
vulgar
inquisitiveness
such
inquisitiveness
as
might
have
been
expected
from
a
fellow
who
tucked
his
serviette
under
his
chin
knew
exactly
how
long
he
would
stay
he
would
stay
until
the
day
after
the
morrow
he
had
only
about
fifty
francs
in
his
pocket
he
had
been
making
a
fool
of
himself
in
another
quarter
of
paris
and
he
had
descended
to
the
pension
frensham
as
a
place
where
he
could
be
absolutely
sure
of
spending
not
more
than
twelve
francs
a
day
its
reputation
was
high
and
it
was
convenient
for
the
galliera
museum
where
he
was
making
some
drawings
which
he
had
come
to
paris
expressly
to
make
and
without
which
he
could
not
reputably
return
to
england
he
was
capable
of
foolishness
but
he
was
also
capable
of
wisdom
and
scarcely
any
pressure
of
need
would
have
induced
him
to
write
home
for
money
to
replace
the
money
spent
on
making
himself
into
a
fool
mardon
was
conscious
of
a
check
but
being
of
an
accommodating
disposition
he
at
once
tried
another
direction
good
food
here
eh
he
suggested
very
said
with
sincerity
i
was
quite
at
that
moment
a
tall
straight
woman
of
uncertain
age
pushed
open
the
principal
door
and
stood
for
an
instant
in
the
doorway
had
just
time
to
notice
that
she
was
handsome
and
pale
and
that
her
hair
was
black
and
then
she
was
gone
again
followed
by
a
clipped
poodle
that
accompanied
her
she
had
signed
with
a
brief
gesture
to
one
of
the
servants
who
at
once
set
about
lighting
the
over
the
table
who
is
that
asked
without
reflecting
that
it
was
now
he
who
was
making
advances
to
the
fellow
whose
napkin
covered
all
his
that
the
missis
that
is
said
mardon
in
a
lower
and
voice
oh
mrs
frensham
yes
but
her
real
name
is
scales
said
mardon
proudly
widow
i
suppose
yes
and
she
runs
the
whole
show
she
runs
the
entire
contraption
said
mardon
solemnly
and
do
you
make
any
mistake
he
was
getting
familiar
beat
him
off
once
more
glancing
with
careful
uninterested
nonchalance
at
the
which
exploded
one
after
another
with
a
little
plop
under
the
application
of
the
maid
taper
the
white
table
gleamed
more
whitely
than
ever
under
the
flaring
gas
people
at
the
end
of
the
room
away
from
the
window
instinctively
smiled
as
though
the
sun
had
begun
to
shine
the
aspect
of
the
dinner
was
changed
ameliorated
and
with
the
reiterated
statement
that
the
evenings
were
drawing
in
though
it
was
only
july
conversation
became
almost
general
in
two
minutes
mardon
was
genially
talking
across
the
whole
length
of
the
table
the
meal
finished
in
a
state
that
resembled
conviviality
matthew
might
not
go
out
into
the
crepuscular
delights
of
paris
unless
he
remained
within
the
shelter
of
the
pension
he
could
not
hope
to
complete
successfully
his
from
folly
to
wisdom
so
he
bravely
passed
through
the
small
door
into
a
small
courtyard
furnished
with
palms
wicker
armchairs
and
two
small
tables
and
he
lighted
a
pipe
and
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
a
copy
of
the
referee
that
retreat
was
called
the
lounge
it
was
the
only
part
of
the
pension
where
smoking
was
not
either
a
positive
crime
or
a
transgression
against
good
form
he
felt
lonely
he
said
to
himself
grimly
in
one
breath
that
pleasure
was
all
rot
and
in
the
next
he
sullenly
demanded
of
the
universe
how
it
was
that
pleasure
could
not
go
on
for
ever
and
why
he
was
not
barney
barnato
two
old
men
entered
the
retreat
and
burnt
cigarettes
with
many
precautions
then
lewis
mardon
appeared
and
sat
down
boldly
next
to
matthew
like
a
privileged
friend
after
all
mardon
was
better
than
nobody
whatever
and
matthew
decided
to
suffer
him
especially
as
he
began
without
preliminary
skirmishing
to
talk
about
life
in
paris
an
irresistible
subject
mardon
said
in
a
worldly
tone
that
the
existence
of
a
bachelor
in
paris
might
easily
be
made
agreeable
but
that
of
course
for
himself
well
he
preferred
as
a
general
rule
the
pension
frensham
sort
of
thing
and
it
was
excellent
for
his
business
still
he
could
not
he
knew
he
compared
the
advantages
of
what
he
called
about
in
paris
with
the
equivalent
in
london
his
information
about
london
was
out
of
date
and
was
able
to
set
him
right
on
important
details
but
his
information
about
paris
was
infinitely
precious
and
interesting
to
the
younger
man
who
saw
that
he
had
hitherto
lived
under
strange
misconceptions
have
a
whiskey
asked
mardon
suddenly
very
good
here
he
added
thanks
drawled
the
temptation
to
listen
to
mardon
as
long
as
mardon
would
talk
was
not
to
be
overcome
and
presently
when
the
old
men
had
departed
they
were
frankly
telling
each
other
stories
in
the
dimness
of
the
retreat
then
when
the
supply
of
stories
came
to
an
end
mardon
smacked
his
lips
over
the
last
drop
of
whiskey
and
ejaculated
yes
as
if
giving
a
general
confirmation
to
all
that
had
been
said
do
have
one
with
me
said
matthew
politely
it
was
the
least
he
could
do
the
second
supply
of
whiskies
was
brought
into
the
lounge
by
mardon
marie
he
smiled
on
her
familiarly
and
remarked
that
he
supposed
she
would
soon
be
going
to
bed
after
a
hard
day
work
she
gave
a
moue
and
a
flounce
in
reply
and
swished
out
carries
herself
well
does
she
observed
mardon
as
though
marie
had
been
an
exhibit
at
an
agricultural
show
ten
years
ago
she
was
very
fresh
and
pretty
but
of
course
it
takes
it
out
of
a
place
like
this
but
still
said
they
must
like
it
or
they
stay
that
is
unless
things
are
very
different
here
from
what
they
are
in
england
the
conversation
seemed
to
have
stimulated
him
to
examine
the
woman
question
in
all
its
bearings
with
philosophic
curiosity
oh
they
like
it
mardon
assured
him
as
one
who
knew
besides
scales
treats
very
well
i
know
that
she
told
me
very
particular
he
looked
around
to
see
if
walls
had
ears
and
by
jove
you
got
to
be
but
she
treats
well
you
scarcely
believe
the
wages
they
get
and
pickings
now
at
the
hotel
moscow
know
the
hotel
moscow
happily
did
he
had
been
advised
to
avoid
it
because
it
catered
exclusively
for
english
visitors
but
in
the
pension
frensham
he
had
accepted
something
even
more
exclusively
british
than
the
hotel
moscow
mardon
was
quite
relieved
at
his
affirmative
the
hotel
moscow
is
a
limited
company
now
said
he
english
really
yes
i
floated
it
it
was
my
idea
a
great
success
that
how
i
know
all
about
the
hotel
moscow
he
looked
at
the
walls
again
i
wanted
to
do
the
same
here
he
murmured
and
had
to
show
that
he
appreciated
this
confidence
but
she
never
would
agree
i
tried
her
all
ways
no
go
it
a
thousand
pities
paying
thing
eh
this
place
i
should
say
it
was
and
i
ought
to
be
able
to
judge
i
reckon
scales
is
one
of
the
shrewdest
women
you
meet
in
a
march
she
made
a
lot
of
money
here
a
lot
of
money
and
there
no
reason
why
a
place
like
this
should
be
five
times
as
big
as
it
is
ten
times
the
scope
unlimited
my
dear
sir
all
that
wanted
is
capital
naturally
she
has
capital
of
her
own
and
she
could
get
more
but
then
as
she
says
she
does
want
the
place
any
bigger
she
says
it
now
just
as
big
as
she
can
handle
that
is
so
she
a
woman
who
could
handle
anything
a
born
manager
but
even
if
it
was
so
all
she
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
retire
only
leave
us
the
place
and
the
name
it
the
name
that
counts
and
she
made
the
name
of
frensham
worth
something
i
can
tell
you
did
she
get
the
place
from
her
husband
asked
her
own
name
of
scales
intrigued
him
mardon
shook
his
head
bought
it
on
her
own
after
the
time
for
a
song
a
song
i
know
because
i
knew
the
original
frenshams
you
must
have
been
in
paris
a
long
time
said
mardon
could
never
resist
an
opportunity
to
talk
about
himself
his
was
a
wonderful
history
and
while
scorning
the
man
for
his
fatuity
was
impressed
and
when
that
was
finished
yes
said
mardon
after
a
pause
reaffirming
everything
in
general
by
a
single
monosyllable
shortly
afterwards
he
rose
saying
that
his
habits
were
regular
he
said
with
a
mechanical
smile
said
trying
to
force
the
tone
of
fellowship
and
not
succeeding
their
intimacy
which
had
sprung
up
like
a
mushroom
suddenly
fell
into
dust
unspoken
comment
to
mardon
back
was
ass
still
the
sum
of
knowledge
had
indubitably
been
increased
during
the
evening
and
the
hour
was
yet
early
ten
the
with
its
beautiful
architecture
and
its
crowds
of
white
toilettes
and
its
frothing
of
champagne
and
of
beer
and
its
musicians
in
tight
red
coats
was
just
beginning
to
be
alive
and
at
a
distance
of
scarcely
a
pictured
the
terraced
glittering
hall
which
had
been
the
prime
origin
of
his
exceeding
foolishness
and
he
pictured
all
the
other
resorts
great
and
small
garlanded
with
white
lanterns
in
the
champs
elysees
and
the
sombre
aisles
of
the
champs
elysees
where
mysterious
pale
figures
walked
troublingly
under
the
shade
of
trees
while
snatches
of
wild
song
or
absurd
brassy
music
floated
up
from
the
resorts
and
restaurants
he
wanted
to
go
out
and
spend
those
fifty
francs
that
remained
in
his
pocket
after
all
why
not
telegraph
to
england
for
more
money
oh
damn
it
he
said
savagely
and
stretched
his
arms
and
got
up
the
lounge
was
very
small
gloomy
and
dreary
one
brilliant
incandescent
light
burned
in
the
hall
crudely
illuminating
the
wicker
fauteuils
a
corded
trunk
with
a
label
on
it
a
fitzroy
barometer
a
map
of
paris
a
coloured
poster
of
the
compagnie
transatlantique
and
the
mahogany
retreat
of
the
in
that
retreat
was
not
only
the
an
aged
woman
with
a
white
cap
above
her
wrinkled
pink
face
but
the
mistress
of
the
establishment
they
were
murmuring
together
softly
they
seemed
to
be
well
disposed
to
one
another
the
portress
was
respectful
but
the
mistress
was
respectful
also
the
hall
with
its
one
light
tranquilly
burning
was
bathed
in
an
honest
calm
the
calm
of
a
work
accomplished
of
gradual
relaxation
from
tension
of
growing
expectation
of
repose
in
its
simplicity
it
affected
as
a
medicine
tonic
for
nerves
might
have
affected
him
in
that
hall
though
exterior
nocturnal
life
was
but
just
stirring
into
activity
it
seemed
that
the
middle
of
the
night
had
come
and
that
these
two
women
alone
watched
in
a
mansion
full
of
sleepers
and
all
the
recitals
which
and
mardon
had
exchanged
sank
to
the
level
of
pitiably
foolish
gossip
felt
that
his
duty
to
the
house
was
to
retire
to
bed
he
felt
too
that
he
could
not
leave
the
house
without
saying
that
he
was
going
out
and
that
he
lacked
the
courage
deliberately
to
tell
these
two
women
that
he
was
going
out
at
that
time
of
night
he
dropped
into
one
of
the
chairs
and
made
a
second
attempt
to
peruse
the
referee
useless
either
his
mind
was
outside
in
the
champs
elysees
or
his
gaze
would
wander
surreptitiously
to
the
figure
of
scales
he
could
not
well
distinguish
her
face
because
it
was
in
the
shadow
of
the
mahogany
then
the
portress
came
forth
from
her
box
and
slightly
bent
sped
actively
across
the
hall
smiling
pleasantly
at
the
guest
as
she
passed
him
and
disappeared
up
the
stairs
the
mistress
was
alone
in
the
retreat
jumped
up
brusquely
dropping
the
paper
with
a
rustle
and
approached
her
excuse
me
he
said
deferentially
have
any
letters
come
for
me
he
knew
that
the
arrival
of
letters
for
him
was
impossible
since
nobody
knew
his
address
what
name
the
question
was
coldly
polite
and
the
questioner
looked
him
full
in
the
face
undoubtedly
she
was
a
handsome
woman
her
hair
was
greying
at
the
temples
and
the
skin
was
withered
and
crossed
with
lines
but
she
was
handsome
she
was
one
of
those
women
of
whom
to
their
last
on
earth
the
stranger
will
say
when
she
was
young
she
must
have
been
worth
looking
at
with
a
little
transient
regret
that
beautiful
young
women
can
not
remain
for
ever
young
her
voice
was
firm
and
even
sweet
in
tone
and
yet
morally
harsh
from
incessant
traffic
with
all
varieties
of
human
nature
her
eyes
were
the
impartial
eyes
of
one
who
is
always
judging
and
evidently
she
was
a
proud
even
a
haughty
creature
with
her
careful
controlled
politeness
evidently
she
considered
herself
superior
to
no
matter
what
guest
her
eyes
announced
that
she
had
lived
and
learnt
that
she
knew
more
about
life
than
any
one
whom
she
was
likely
to
meet
and
that
having
succeeded
in
life
she
had
tremendous
confidence
in
herself
the
proof
of
her
success
was
the
unique
frensham
a
consciousness
of
the
uniqueness
of
frensham
was
also
in
those
eyes
theoretically
matthew
mental
attitude
towards
keepers
was
condescending
but
here
it
was
not
condescending
it
had
the
real
respectfulness
of
a
man
who
for
the
moment
at
any
rate
is
impressed
beyond
his
calculations
his
glance
fell
as
he
said
then
he
looked
up
again
he
said
the
words
awkwardly
and
rather
fearfully
as
if
aware
that
he
was
playing
with
fire
if
this
scales
was
the
aunt
of
his
friend
cyril
povey
she
must
know
those
two
names
locally
so
famous
did
she
start
did
she
show
a
sign
of
being
perturbed
at
first
he
thought
he
detected
a
symptom
of
emotion
but
in
an
instant
he
was
sure
that
he
had
detected
nothing
of
the
sort
and
that
it
was
silly
to
suppose
that
he
was
treading
on
the
edge
of
a
romance
then
she
turned
towards
the
at
her
side
and
he
saw
her
face
in
profile
it
bore
a
sudden
and
astonishing
likeness
to
the
profile
of
cyril
povey
a
resemblance
unmistakable
and
finally
decisive
the
nose
and
the
curve
of
the
upper
lip
were
absolutely
cyril
matthew
felt
very
queer
he
felt
like
a
criminal
in
peril
of
being
caught
in
the
act
and
he
could
not
understand
why
he
should
feel
so
the
landlady
looked
in
the
and
in
the
no
she
said
quietly
i
see
nothing
for
you
taken
with
a
swift
rash
audacity
he
said
have
you
had
any
one
named
povey
here
recently
povey
yes
cyril
povey
of
bursley
in
the
five
towns
he
was
very
impressionable
very
sensitive
was
matthew
his
voice
trembled
as
he
spoke
but
hers
also
trembled
in
reply
not
that
i
remember
no
were
you
expecting
him
to
be
here
well
it
was
at
all
sure
he
muttered
thank
you
she
said
apparently
with
the
simple
perfunctoriness
of
the
landlady
who
says
to
dozens
of
strangers
every
evening
he
hurried
away
upstairs
and
met
the
portress
coming
down
well
well
he
thought
of
all
the
queer
things
and
he
kept
nodding
his
head
at
last
he
had
encountered
something
really
strange
in
the
spectacle
of
existence
it
had
fallen
to
him
to
discover
the
legendary
woman
who
had
fled
from
bursley
before
he
was
born
and
of
whom
nobody
knew
anything
what
news
for
cyril
what
a
staggering
episode
he
had
scarcely
any
sleep
that
night
he
wondered
whether
he
would
be
able
to
meet
scales
without
on
the
morrow
however
he
was
spared
the
curious
ordeal
of
meeting
her
she
did
not
appear
at
all
on
the
following
day
nor
did
he
see
her
before
he
left
he
could
not
find
a
pretext
for
asking
why
she
was
invisible
ii
the
hansom
of
matthew
drew
up
in
front
of
no
victoria
grove
chelsea
his
was
on
the
roof
of
the
cab
the
cabman
had
a
red
flower
in
his
buttonhole
matthew
leaped
out
of
the
vehicle
holding
his
straw
hat
on
his
head
with
one
hand
on
reaching
the
pavement
he
checked
himself
suddenly
and
became
carelessly
calm
another
and
figure
was
standing
at
the
of
no
in
the
act
of
lighting
a
cigarette
hello
matt
exclaimed
the
second
figure
languidly
and
in
a
veiled
voice
due
to
the
fact
that
he
was
still
holding
the
match
to
the
cigarette
and
puffing
what
the
meaning
of
all
this
fluster
just
the
man
i
want
to
see
he
threw
away
the
match
with
a
wave
of
the
arm
and
took
matthew
hand
for
a
moment
blowing
a
double
shaft
of
smoke
through
his
nose
i
want
to
see
you
too
said
matthew
and
i
only
got
a
minute
i
on
my
way
to
euston
i
must
catch
the
he
looked
at
his
friend
and
could
positively
see
no
feature
of
it
that
was
not
a
feature
of
scales
face
also
the
elderly
woman
held
her
body
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
the
young
man
it
was
entirely
disconcerting
have
a
cigarette
answered
cyril
povey
imperturbably
he
was
two
years
younger
than
matthew
from
whom
he
had
acquired
most
of
his
vast
and
intricate
knowledge
of
life
and
art
with
certain
leading
notions
of
deportment
whose
pupil
indeed
he
was
in
all
the
things
that
matter
to
young
men
but
he
had
already
surpassed
his
professor
he
could
pretend
to
be
old
much
more
successfully
than
matthew
could
the
cabman
approvingly
watched
the
ignition
of
the
second
cigarette
and
then
the
cabman
pulled
out
a
cigar
and
showed
his
large
white
teeth
as
he
bit
the
end
off
it
the
appearance
and
manner
of
his
fare
the
quality
of
the
and
the
opening
gestures
of
the
interview
between
the
two
young
dukes
had
put
the
cabman
in
an
optimistic
mood
he
had
no
apprehensions
of
miserly
and
ungentlemanly
conduct
by
his
fare
upon
the
arrival
at
euston
he
knew
the
language
of
the
tilt
of
a
straw
hat
and
it
was
a
magnificent
day
in
london
the
group
of
the
two
elegances
dominated
by
the
perfection
of
the
cabman
made
a
striking
tableau
of
triumphant
masculinity
content
with
itself
and
needing
nothing
matthew
lightly
took
cyril
arm
and
drew
him
further
down
the
street
past
the
gate
leading
to
the
studio
hidden
behind
a
house
which
cyril
rented
look
here
my
boy
he
began
i
found
your
aunt
well
that
very
nice
of
you
said
cyril
solemnly
that
a
friendly
act
may
i
ask
what
aunt
scales
said
matthew
you
know
not
the
cyril
face
changed
yes
precisely
said
matthew
feeling
that
he
was
not
being
cheated
of
the
legitimate
joy
caused
by
making
a
sensation
assuredly
he
had
made
a
sensation
in
victoria
grove
when
he
had
related
the
whole
story
cyril
said
then
she
does
know
you
know
i
do
think
so
no
i
sure
she
does
she
may
guess
but
how
can
you
be
certain
you
have
made
a
mistake
it
may
be
that
look
here
my
boy
matthew
interrupted
him
i
not
made
any
mistake
but
you
no
proof
proof
be
damned
said
matthew
nettled
i
tell
you
it
her
oh
all
right
all
right
what
puzzles
me
most
is
what
the
devil
you
were
doing
in
a
place
like
that
according
to
your
description
of
it
it
must
be
a
i
went
there
because
i
was
broke
said
matthew
razzle
matthew
nodded
pretty
stiff
that
commented
cyril
when
matthew
had
narrated
the
prologue
to
frensham
well
she
absolutely
swore
she
never
took
less
than
two
hundred
francs
and
she
looked
it
too
and
she
was
worth
it
i
had
the
time
of
my
life
with
that
woman
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
no
more
english
for
me
they
simply
are
in
it
how
old
was
she
matthew
reflected
judicially
i
should
say
she
was
thirty
the
gaze
of
admiration
and
envy
was
upon
him
he
had
the
legitimate
joy
of
making
a
second
sensation
i
let
you
know
more
about
that
when
i
come
back
he
added
i
can
open
your
eyes
my
child
cyril
smiled
sheepishly
why
ca
you
stay
now
he
asked
i
going
to
take
the
cast
of
that
verrall
girl
arm
this
afternoon
and
i
know
i
ca
do
it
alone
and
robson
no
good
you
just
the
man
i
want
ca
said
matthew
well
come
into
the
studio
a
minute
anyhow
have
time
i
shall
miss
my
train
i
do
care
if
you
miss
forty
trains
you
must
come
in
you
got
to
see
that
fountain
cyril
insisted
crossly
matthew
yielded
when
they
emerged
into
the
street
again
after
six
minutes
of
cyril
savage
interest
in
his
own
work
matthew
remembered
scales
of
course
you
write
to
your
mother
he
said
yes
said
cyril
i
write
but
if
you
happen
to
see
her
you
might
tell
her
i
will
said
matthew
shall
you
go
over
to
paris
what
to
see
auntie
he
smiled
i
do
know
depends
if
the
mater
will
fork
out
all
my
exes
it
an
idea
he
said
lightly
and
then
without
any
change
of
tone
naturally
if
you
going
to
idle
about
here
all
morning
you
are
likely
to
catch
the
matthew
got
into
the
cab
while
the
driver
the
stump
of
a
cigar
between
his
exposed
teeth
leaned
forward
and
lifted
the
reins
away
from
the
tilted
straw
hat
lend
me
some
silver
matthew
demanded
it
a
good
thing
i
got
my
return
ticket
i
run
it
as
fine
as
ever
i
did
in
my
life
cyril
produced
eight
shillings
in
silver
secure
in
the
possession
of
these
riches
matthew
called
to
the
driver
euston
like
hell
yes
sir
said
the
driver
calmly
not
coming
my
way
i
suppose
matthew
shouted
as
an
afterthought
just
when
the
cab
began
to
move
no
barber
cyril
shouted
in
answer
and
waved
his
hand
the
horse
rattled
into
fulham
road
iii
three
days
later
matthew
was
walking
along
bursley
market
place
when
just
opposite
the
town
hall
he
met
a
short
fat
lady
dressed
in
black
with
a
black
embroidered
mantle
and
a
small
bonnet
tied
with
black
ribbon
and
ornamented
with
jet
fruit
and
crape
leaves
as
she
stepped
slowly
and
carefully
forward
she
had
the
dignified
important
look
of
a
provincial
woman
who
has
always
been
accustomed
to
deference
in
her
native
town
and
whose
income
is
ample
enough
to
extort
obsequiousness
from
the
vulgar
of
all
ranks
but
immediately
she
caught
sight
of
matthew
her
face
changed
she
became
simple
and
naive
she
blushed
slightly
smiling
with
a
timid
pleasure
for
her
matthew
belonged
to
a
superior
race
he
bore
the
almost
sacred
name
of
peel
his
family
had
been
distinguished
in
the
district
for
generations
you
could
without
impropriety
utter
it
in
the
same
breath
with
and
stood
not
much
lower
neither
her
which
was
great
nor
her
commonsense
which
far
exceeded
the
average
could
enable
her
to
extend
as
far
as
the
peels
the
theory
that
one
man
is
as
good
as
another
the
peels
never
shopped
in
luke
square
even
in
its
golden
days
the
square
could
not
have
expected
such
a
condescension
the
peels
shopped
in
london
or
in
stafford
at
a
pinch
in
oldcastle
that
was
the
distinction
for
the
ageing
stout
lady
in
black
why
she
had
not
in
six
years
recovered
from
her
surprise
that
her
son
and
matthew
treated
each
other
rudely
as
equals
she
and
matthew
did
not
often
meet
but
they
liked
each
other
her
involuntary
meekness
flattered
him
and
his
rather
elaborate
homage
flattered
her
he
admired
her
fundamental
goodness
and
her
occasional
raps
at
cyril
seemed
to
put
him
into
ecstasies
of
joy
well
povey
he
greeted
her
standing
over
her
with
his
hat
raised
it
was
a
fashion
he
had
picked
up
in
paris
here
i
am
you
see
you
quite
a
stranger
matthew
i
need
ask
you
how
you
are
have
you
been
seeing
anything
of
my
boy
lately
not
since
wednesday
said
matthew
of
course
he
written
to
you
there
no
course
about
it
she
laughed
faintly
i
had
a
short
letter
from
him
on
wednesday
morning
he
said
you
were
in
paris
but
since
that
has
he
written
if
i
hear
from
him
on
sunday
i
shall
be
lucky
bless
ye
said
constance
grimly
it
not
that
will
kill
cyril
but
do
you
mean
to
say
he
has
matthew
stopped
whatever
amiss
asked
constance
matthew
was
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
or
say
oh
nothing
now
matthew
do
please
constance
tone
had
suddenly
quite
changed
it
had
become
firm
commanding
and
gravely
suspicious
the
conversation
had
ceased
to
be
for
her
matthew
saw
how
nervous
and
how
fragile
she
was
he
had
never
noticed
before
that
she
was
so
sensitive
to
trifles
though
it
was
notorious
that
nobody
could
safely
discuss
cyril
with
her
in
terms
of
chaff
he
was
really
astounded
at
that
youth
carelessness
shameful
carelessness
that
cyril
attitude
to
his
mother
was
marked
by
a
certain
benevolent
negligence
this
matthew
knew
but
not
to
have
written
to
her
with
the
important
news
concerning
scales
was
utterly
inexcusable
and
matthew
determined
that
he
would
tell
cyril
so
he
felt
very
sorry
for
povey
she
seemed
pathetic
to
him
standing
there
in
ignorance
of
a
tremendous
fact
which
she
ought
to
have
been
aware
of
he
was
very
content
that
he
had
said
nothing
about
scales
to
anybody
except
his
own
mother
who
had
prudently
enjoined
silence
upon
him
saying
that
his
one
duty
having
told
cyril
was
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
until
the
poveys
talked
had
it
not
been
for
his
mother
advice
he
would
assuredly
have
spread
the
amazing
tale
and
povey
might
have
first
heard
of
it
from
a
stranger
gossip
which
would
have
been
too
cruel
upon
her
oh
matthew
tried
to
smile
gaily
archly
you
bound
to
hear
from
cyril
he
wanted
to
persuade
her
that
he
was
concealing
merely
some
delightful
surprise
from
her
but
he
did
not
succeed
with
all
his
experience
of
the
world
and
of
women
he
was
not
clever
enough
to
deceive
that
simple
woman
i
waiting
matthew
she
said
in
a
tone
that
flattened
the
smile
out
of
matthew
sympathetic
face
she
was
ruthless
the
fact
was
she
had
in
an
instant
convinced
herself
that
cyril
had
met
some
girl
and
was
engaged
to
be
married
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
what
has
cyril
been
doing
she
added
after
a
pause
it
nothing
to
do
with
cyril
said
he
then
what
is
it
it
was
about
scales
he
murmured
nearly
trembling
as
she
offered
no
response
merely
looking
around
her
in
a
peculiar
fashion
he
said
shall
we
walk
along
a
bit
and
he
turned
in
the
direction
in
which
she
had
been
going
she
obeyed
the
suggestion
what
did
ye
say
she
asked
the
name
of
scales
for
a
moment
had
no
significance
for
her
but
when
she
comprehended
it
she
was
afraid
and
so
she
said
vacantly
as
though
wishing
to
postpone
a
shock
what
did
ye
say
i
said
it
was
about
scales
you
know
i
her
in
paris
and
he
was
saying
to
himself
i
ought
not
to
be
telling
this
poor
old
thing
here
in
the
street
but
what
can
i
do
nay
nay
she
muttered
she
stopped
and
looked
at
him
with
a
worried
expression
then
he
observed
that
the
hand
that
carried
her
reticule
was
making
strange
purposeless
curves
in
the
air
and
her
rosy
face
went
the
colour
of
cream
as
though
it
had
been
painted
with
one
stroke
of
an
unseen
brush
matthew
was
very
much
put
about
had
you
better
he
began
eh
she
said
i
must
sit
me
her
bag
dropped
he
supported
her
to
the
door
of
allman
shop
the
ironmonger
unfortunately
there
were
two
steps
up
into
the
shop
and
she
could
not
climb
them
she
collapsed
like
a
sack
of
flour
on
the
first
step
young
edward
allman
ran
to
the
door
he
was
wearing
a
black
apron
and
fidgeting
with
it
in
his
excitement
do
lift
her
up
do
try
to
lift
her
up
mr
he
cried
as
matthew
instinctively
began
to
do
the
wrong
thing
matthew
stopped
looking
a
fool
and
feeling
one
and
he
and
young
allman
contemplated
each
other
helpless
for
a
second
across
the
body
of
constance
povey
a
part
of
the
market
place
now
perceived
that
the
unusual
was
occurring
it
was
shawcross
the
chemist
next
door
to
allman
who
dealt
adequately
with
the
situation
he
had
seen
all
while
selling
a
kodak
to
a
young
lady
and
he
ran
out
with
salts
constance
recovered
very
rapidly
she
had
not
quite
swooned
she
gave
a
long
sigh
and
whispered
weakly
that
she
was
all
right
the
three
men
helped
her
into
the
lofty
dark
shop
which
smelt
of
nails
and
of
and
she
was
balanced
on
a
ricketty
chair
my
word
exclaimed
young
allman
in
his
loud
voice
when
she
could
smile
and
the
pink
was
returning
reluctantly
to
her
cheeks
you
must
frighten
us
like
that
mrs
povey
matthew
said
nothing
he
had
at
last
created
a
genuine
sensation
once
again
he
felt
like
a
criminal
and
could
not
understand
why
constance
announced
that
she
would
walk
slowly
home
down
the
and
along
wedgwood
street
but
when
glancing
round
in
her
returned
strength
she
saw
the
hedge
of
faces
at
the
doorway
she
agreed
with
shawcross
that
she
would
do
better
to
have
a
cab
young
allman
went
to
the
door
and
whistled
to
the
unique
cab
that
stands
for
ever
at
the
grand
entrance
to
the
town
hall
matthew
will
come
with
me
said
constance
certainly
with
pleasure
said
matthew
and
she
passed
through
the
little
crowd
of
gapers
on
arm
just
take
care
of
yourself
missis
said
shawcross
to
her
through
the
window
of
the
cab
it
fainting
weather
and
we
none
of
us
any
younger
seemingly
she
nodded
i
awfully
sorry
i
upset
you
povey
said
matthew
when
the
cab
moved
she
shook
her
head
refusing
his
apology
as
unnecessary
tears
filled
her
eyes
in
less
than
a
minute
the
cab
had
stopped
in
front
of
constance
door
she
demanded
her
reticule
from
matthew
who
had
carried
it
since
it
fell
she
would
pay
the
cabman
never
before
had
matthew
permitted
a
woman
to
pay
for
a
cab
in
which
he
had
ridden
but
there
was
no
arguing
with
constance
constance
was
dangerous
amy
bates
still
inhabiting
the
cave
had
seen
the
through
the
grating
of
her
window
and
had
panted
up
the
kitchen
stairs
to
open
the
door
ere
constance
had
climbed
the
steps
amy
decidedly
over
forty
was
a
woman
of
authority
she
wanted
to
know
what
was
the
matter
and
constance
had
to
tell
her
that
she
had
unwell
amy
took
the
hat
and
mantle
and
departed
to
prepare
a
cup
of
tea
when
they
were
alone
constance
said
to
matthew
now
matthew
will
you
please
tell
me
it
only
this
he
began
and
as
he
told
it
in
quite
a
few
words
it
indeed
had
the
air
of
being
that
and
yet
his
voice
shook
in
sympathy
with
the
ageing
woman
controlled
but
visible
emotion
it
seemed
to
him
that
gladness
should
have
filled
the
absurd
little
parlour
but
the
spirit
that
presided
had
no
name
it
was
certainly
not
joy
he
himself
felt
very
sad
desolated
he
would
have
given
much
money
to
have
been
spared
the
experience
he
knew
simply
that
in
the
memory
of
the
stout
comical
nice
woman
in
the
he
had
stirred
old
old
things
wakened
slumbers
that
might
have
been
eternal
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
sitting
on
the
very
spot
where
the
sofa
had
been
on
which
samuel
povey
lay
when
a
beautiful
and
shameless
young
creature
of
fifteen
extracted
his
tooth
he
did
not
know
that
constance
was
sitting
in
the
very
chair
in
which
the
memorable
baines
had
sat
in
vain
conflict
with
that
same
unconquerable
girl
he
did
not
know
ten
thousand
matters
that
were
rushing
violently
about
in
the
vast
heart
of
constance
she
him
in
detail
but
she
did
not
put
the
questions
which
he
in
his
innocence
expected
such
as
if
her
sister
looked
old
if
her
hair
was
grey
if
she
was
stout
or
thin
and
until
amy
mystified
and
resentful
had
served
the
tea
on
a
little
silver
tray
she
remained
comparatively
calm
it
was
in
the
middle
of
a
gulp
of
tea
that
she
broke
down
and
matthew
had
to
take
the
cup
from
her
i
ca
thank
you
matthew
she
wept
i
could
thank
you
enough
but
i
done
nothing
he
protested
she
shook
her
head
i
never
hoped
for
this
never
hoped
for
it
she
went
on
it
makes
me
so
happy
in
a
way
you
must
take
any
notice
of
me
i
silly
you
must
kindly
write
down
that
address
for
me
and
i
must
write
to
cyril
at
once
and
i
must
see
mr
critchlow
it
really
very
funny
that
cyril
has
written
to
you
said
matthew
cyril
has
not
been
a
good
son
she
said
with
sudden
solemn
coldness
to
think
that
he
should
have
kept
that
she
wept
again
at
length
matthew
saw
the
possibility
of
leaving
he
felt
her
warm
soft
crinkled
hand
round
his
fingers
you
behaved
very
nicely
over
this
she
said
and
very
cleverly
in
every
thing
both
over
there
and
here
nobody
could
have
shown
a
nicer
feeling
than
you
shown
it
a
great
comfort
to
me
that
my
son
has
got
you
for
a
friend
when
he
thought
of
his
escapades
and
of
all
the
knowledge
unutterable
in
bursley
fantastically
impossible
in
bursley
which
he
had
imparted
to
her
son
he
marvelled
that
the
maternal
instinct
should
be
so
deceived
still
he
felt
that
her
praise
of
him
was
deserved
outside
he
gave
vent
to
a
of
relief
he
smiled
in
his
worldliest
manner
but
the
smile
was
a
sham
a
pretence
to
himself
a
childish
attempt
to
disguise
from
himself
how
profoundly
he
had
been
moved
by
a
natural
scene
iv
on
the
night
when
matthew
spoke
to
scales
matthew
was
not
the
only
person
in
the
pension
frensham
who
failed
to
sleep
when
the
old
portress
came
downstairs
from
her
errand
she
observed
that
her
mistress
was
leaving
the
mahogany
retreat
she
is
sleeping
tranquilly
the
poor
one
said
the
portress
discharging
her
commission
which
had
been
to
learn
the
latest
news
of
the
mistress
indisposed
dog
fossette
in
saying
this
her
ancient
vibrant
voice
was
rich
with
sympathy
for
the
suffering
animal
and
she
smiled
she
was
rather
like
a
figure
out
of
an
almshouse
with
her
pink
apparently
brittle
skin
her
tight
black
dress
and
frilled
white
cap
she
stooped
habitually
and
always
walked
quickly
with
her
head
a
few
inches
in
advance
of
her
feet
her
grey
hair
was
scanty
she
was
old
nobody
perhaps
knew
exactly
how
old
sophia
had
taken
her
with
the
pension
over
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
because
she
was
old
and
could
not
easily
have
found
another
place
although
the
clientele
was
almost
exclusively
english
she
spoke
only
french
explaining
herself
to
britons
by
means
of
benevolent
smiles
i
think
i
shall
go
to
bed
jacqueline
said
the
mistress
in
reply
a
strange
reply
thought
jacqueline
the
unalterable
custom
of
jacqueline
was
to
retire
at
midnight
and
to
rise
at
her
mistress
also
usually
retired
about
midnight
and
during
the
final
hour
mistress
and
portress
saw
a
good
deal
of
each
other
and
considering
that
jacqueline
had
just
been
sent
up
into
the
mistress
own
bedroom
to
glance
at
fossette
and
that
the
bulletin
was
satisfactory
and
that
madame
and
jacqueline
had
several
customary
daily
matters
to
discuss
it
seemed
odd
that
madame
should
thus
be
going
instantly
to
bed
however
jacqueline
said
nothing
but
very
well
madame
and
the
number
arrange
yourself
as
you
can
said
the
mistress
curtly
it
is
well
madame
good
evening
madame
and
a
good
night
jacqueline
alone
in
the
hall
her
box
and
set
upon
one
of
those
endless
mysterious
tasks
which
occupied
her
when
she
was
not
rushing
to
and
fro
or
whistling
up
the
tubes
sophia
scarcely
troubling
even
to
glance
into
fossette
round
basket
undressed
put
out
the
light
and
got
into
bed
she
felt
extremely
and
inexplicably
gloomy
she
did
not
wish
to
reflect
she
strongly
wished
not
to
reflect
but
her
mind
insisted
on
reflection
a
monotonous
futile
and
distressing
reflection
povey
povey
could
this
be
constance
povey
the
unique
samuel
povey
that
is
to
say
not
he
but
his
son
constance
son
had
constance
a
son
constance
must
be
over
fifty
now
perhaps
a
grandmother
had
she
really
married
samuel
povey
possibly
she
was
dead
certainly
her
mother
must
be
dead
and
aunt
harriet
and
critchlow
if
alive
her
mother
must
be
at
least
eighty
years
of
age
the
cumulative
effect
of
merely
remaining
inactive
when
one
ought
to
be
active
was
terrible
undoubtedly
she
should
have
communicated
with
her
family
it
was
silly
not
to
have
done
so
after
all
even
if
she
had
as
a
child
stolen
a
trifle
of
money
from
her
wealthy
aunt
what
would
that
have
mattered
she
had
been
proud
she
was
criminally
proud
that
was
her
vice
she
admitted
it
frankly
but
she
could
not
alter
her
pride
everybody
had
some
weak
spot
her
reputation
for
sagacity
for
commonsense
was
she
knew
enormous
she
always
felt
when
people
were
talking
to
her
that
they
regarded
her
as
a
very
unusually
wise
woman
and
yet
she
had
been
guilty
of
the
capital
folly
of
cutting
herself
off
from
her
family
she
was
ageing
and
she
was
alone
in
the
world
she
was
enriching
herself
she
had
the
most
perfectly
managed
and
the
most
respectable
pension
in
the
world
she
sincerely
believed
and
she
was
alone
in
the
world
acquaintances
she
had
french
people
who
never
offered
nor
accepted
hospitality
other
than
tea
or
wine
and
one
or
two
members
of
the
english
commercial
colony
but
her
one
friend
was
fossette
aged
three
years
she
was
the
most
solitary
person
on
earth
she
had
heard
no
word
of
gerald
no
word
of
anybody
nobody
whatever
could
truly
be
interested
in
her
fate
this
was
what
she
had
achieved
after
a
quarter
of
a
century
of
ceaseless
labour
and
anxiety
during
which
she
had
not
once
been
away
from
the
rue
lord
byron
for
more
than
thirty
hours
at
a
stretch
it
was
appalling
the
passage
of
years
and
the
passage
of
years
would
grow
more
appalling
ten
years
hence
where
would
she
be
she
pictured
herself
dying
horrible
of
course
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
her
from
going
back
to
bursley
and
repairing
the
grand
error
of
her
girlhood
no
nothing
except
the
fact
that
her
whole
soul
recoiled
from
the
mere
idea
of
any
such
enterprise
she
was
a
fixture
in
the
rue
lord
byron
she
was
a
part
of
the
street
she
knew
all
that
happened
or
could
happen
there
she
was
attached
to
it
by
the
heavy
chains
of
habit
in
the
chill
way
of
long
use
she
loved
it
there
the
incandescent
of
the
outside
had
been
turned
down
as
it
was
turned
down
every
night
if
it
is
possible
to
love
such
a
phenomenon
she
loved
that
phenomenon
that
phenomenon
was
a
portion
of
her
life
dear
to
her
an
agreeable
young
man
that
then
evidently
since
her
days
in
bursley
the
peels
and
the
swynnertons
partners
in
business
must
have
intermarried
or
there
must
have
been
some
affair
of
a
will
did
he
suspect
who
she
was
he
had
had
a
very
guilty
look
no
he
could
not
have
suspected
who
she
was
the
idea
was
ridiculous
probably
he
did
not
even
know
that
her
name
was
scales
and
even
if
he
knew
her
name
he
had
probably
never
heard
of
gerald
scales
or
the
story
of
her
flight
why
he
could
not
have
been
born
until
after
she
had
left
bursley
besides
the
peels
were
always
quite
aloof
from
the
ordinary
social
life
of
the
town
no
he
could
not
have
suspected
her
identity
it
was
infantile
to
conceive
such
a
thing
and
yet
she
inconsequently
proceeded
in
the
tangle
of
her
afflicted
mind
supposing
he
had
suspected
it
supposing
by
some
queer
chance
he
had
heard
her
forgotten
story
and
casually
put
two
and
two
together
supposing
even
that
he
were
merely
to
mention
in
the
five
towns
that
the
pension
frensham
was
kept
by
a
scales
scales
people
might
repeat
what
does
that
remind
me
of
and
the
ball
might
roll
and
roll
till
constance
or
somebody
picked
it
up
and
then
moreover
a
detail
of
which
she
had
at
first
unaccountably
failed
to
mark
the
significance
this
was
a
friend
of
the
povey
as
to
whom
he
had
inquired
in
that
case
it
could
not
be
the
same
povey
impossible
that
the
peels
should
be
on
terms
of
friendship
with
samuel
povey
or
his
connections
but
supposing
after
all
they
were
supposing
something
utterly
unanticipated
and
revolutionary
had
happened
in
the
five
towns
she
was
disturbed
she
was
insecure
she
foresaw
inquiries
being
made
concerning
her
she
foresaw
an
immense
family
fuss
endless
tomfoolery
the
upsetting
of
her
existence
the
destruction
of
her
calm
and
she
sank
away
from
that
prospect
she
could
not
face
it
she
did
not
want
to
face
it
no
she
cried
passionately
in
her
soul
i
lived
alone
and
i
stay
as
i
am
i
ca
change
at
my
time
of
life
and
her
attitude
towards
a
possible
invasion
of
her
solitude
became
one
of
resentment
i
wo
have
it
i
wo
have
it
i
will
be
left
alone
constance
what
can
constance
be
to
me
or
i
to
her
now
the
vision
of
any
change
in
her
existence
was
in
the
highest
degree
painful
to
her
and
not
only
painful
it
frightened
her
it
made
her
shrink
but
she
could
not
dismiss
it
she
could
not
argue
herself
out
of
it
the
apparition
of
matthew
had
somehow
altered
the
very
stuff
of
her
fibres
and
surging
on
the
outskirts
of
the
central
storm
of
her
brain
were
ten
thousand
apprehensions
about
the
management
of
the
pension
all
was
black
hopeless
the
pension
might
have
been
the
most
complete
business
failure
that
gross
carelessness
and
incapacity
had
ever
provoked
was
it
not
the
fact
that
she
had
to
supervise
everything
herself
that
she
could
depend
on
no
one
were
she
to
be
absent
even
for
a
single
day
the
entire
structure
would
inevitably
fall
instead
of
working
less
she
worked
harder
and
who
could
guarantee
that
her
investments
were
safe
when
dawn
announced
itself
slowly
discovering
each
object
in
the
chamber
she
was
fever
seemed
to
rage
in
her
head
and
in
and
round
her
mouth
she
had
strange
sensations
fossette
stirred
in
the
basket
near
the
large
desk
on
which
multifarious
files
and
papers
were
ranged
with
minute
particularity
fossette
she
tried
to
call
out
but
no
sound
issued
from
her
lips
she
could
not
move
her
tongue
she
tried
to
protrude
it
and
could
not
for
hours
she
had
been
conscious
of
a
headache
her
heart
sank
she
was
sick
with
fear
her
memory
flashed
to
her
father
and
his
seizure
she
was
his
daughter
paralysis
ca
serait
le
comble
she
thought
in
french
horrified
her
fear
became
abject
can
i
move
at
all
she
thought
and
madly
jerked
her
head
yes
she
could
move
her
head
slightly
on
the
pillow
and
she
could
stretch
her
right
arm
both
arms
absurd
cowardice
of
course
it
was
not
a
seizure
she
reassured
herself
still
she
could
not
put
her
tongue
out
suddenly
she
began
to
hiccough
and
she
had
no
control
over
the
hiccough
she
put
her
hand
to
the
bell
whose
ringing
would
summon
the
man
who
slept
in
a
pantry
off
the
hall
and
suddenly
the
hiccough
ceased
her
hand
dropped
she
was
better
besides
what
use
in
ringing
for
a
man
if
she
could
not
speak
to
him
through
the
door
she
must
wait
for
jacqueline
at
six
every
morning
summer
and
winter
jacqueline
entered
her
bedroom
to
release
the
dog
for
a
moment
airing
under
her
own
supervision
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
showed
five
minutes
past
three
she
had
three
hours
to
wait
fossette
pattered
across
the
room
and
sprang
on
to
the
bed
and
nestled
down
sophia
ignored
her
but
fossette
being
herself
unwell
and
torpid
did
not
seem
to
care
jacqueline
was
late
in
the
quarter
of
an
hour
between
six
and
a
quarter
past
sophia
suffered
the
supreme
pangs
of
despair
and
verged
upon
insanity
it
appeared
to
her
that
her
cranium
would
blow
off
under
pressure
from
within
then
the
door
opened
silently
a
few
inches
usually
jacqueline
came
into
the
room
but
sometimes
she
stood
behind
the
door
and
called
in
her
soft
trembling
voice
fossette
fossette
and
on
this
morning
she
did
not
come
into
the
room
the
dog
did
not
immediately
respond
sophia
was
in
an
agony
she
marshalled
all
her
volition
all
her
and
strength
to
shout
jacqueline
it
came
out
of
her
a
horribly
difficult
and
misshapen
birth
but
it
came
she
was
exhausted
yes
madame
jacqueline
entered
as
soon
as
she
had
a
glimpse
of
sophia
she
threw
up
her
hands
sophia
stared
at
her
wordless
i
will
fetch
the
doctor
myself
whispered
jacqueline
and
fled
jacqueline
the
woman
stopped
then
sophia
determined
to
force
herself
to
make
a
speech
and
she
braced
her
muscles
to
an
unprecedented
effort
say
not
a
word
to
the
others
she
could
not
bear
that
the
whole
household
should
know
of
her
illness
jacqueline
nodded
and
vanished
the
dog
following
jacqueline
understood
she
lived
in
the
place
with
her
mistress
as
with
a
sophia
began
to
feel
better
she
could
get
into
a
sitting
posture
though
the
movement
made
her
dizzy
by
working
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
she
could
see
herself
in
the
glass
of
the
wardrobe
and
she
saw
that
the
lower
part
of
her
face
was
twisted
out
of
shape
the
doctor
who
knew
her
and
who
earned
a
lot
of
money
in
her
house
told
her
frankly
what
had
happened
paralysie
was
the
phrase
he
used
she
understood
a
very
slight
attack
due
to
overwork
and
worry
he
ordered
absolute
rest
and
quiet
impossible
she
said
genuinely
convinced
that
she
alone
was
indispensable
repose
the
most
absolute
he
repeated
she
marvelled
that
a
few
words
with
a
man
who
chanced
to
be
named
could
have
resulted
in
such
a
disaster
and
drew
a
curious
satisfaction
from
this
fearful
proof
that
she
was
so
but
even
then
she
did
not
realize
how
profoundly
she
had
been
disturbed
v
my
darling
sophia
the
inevitable
miracle
had
occurred
her
suspicions
concerning
that
were
after
all
here
was
a
letter
from
constance
the
writing
on
the
envelope
was
not
constance
but
even
before
examining
it
she
had
had
a
peculiar
qualm
she
received
letters
from
england
nearly
every
day
asking
about
rooms
and
prices
and
on
many
of
them
she
had
to
pay
threepence
excess
postage
because
the
writers
carelessly
or
carefully
forgot
that
a
penny
stamp
was
not
sufficient
there
was
nothing
to
distinguish
this
envelope
and
yet
her
first
glance
at
it
had
startled
her
and
when
deciphering
the
smudged
she
made
out
the
word
her
heart
did
literally
seem
to
stop
and
she
opened
the
letter
in
quite
violent
tremulation
thinking
to
herself
the
doctor
would
say
this
is
very
bad
for
me
six
days
had
elapsed
since
her
attack
and
she
was
wonderfully
better
the
distortion
of
her
face
had
almost
disappeared
but
the
doctor
was
grave
he
ordered
no
medicine
merely
a
tonic
and
monotonously
insisted
on
the
most
absolute
on
perfect
mental
calm
he
said
little
else
allowing
sophia
to
judge
from
his
silences
the
seriousness
of
her
condition
yes
the
receipt
of
such
a
letter
must
be
bad
for
her
she
controlled
herself
while
she
read
it
lying
in
her
against
several
pillows
on
the
bed
a
mist
did
not
form
in
her
eyes
nor
did
she
sob
nor
betray
physically
that
she
was
not
reading
an
order
for
two
rooms
for
a
week
but
the
expenditure
of
nervous
force
necessary
to
was
terrific
constance
handwriting
had
changed
it
was
however
easily
recognizable
as
a
development
of
the
neat
calligraphy
of
the
girl
who
could
print
the
of
sophia
was
formed
in
the
same
way
as
she
had
formed
it
in
the
last
letter
which
she
had
received
from
her
at
axe
my
darling
sophia
i
can
not
tell
you
how
overjoyed
i
was
to
learn
that

these
years

by

subscription
for
miss
chetwynd
poor
old
thing
her
sister
is
dead
and
she
is
in
poverty
i
have
put
myself
down
for
now
my
dear
sister
please
do
write
to
me
at
once
you
see
it
is
still
the
old
address
i
remain
my
darling
sophia
with
much
love
your
affectionate
sister
constance
povey
i
should
have
written
yesterday
but
i
was
not
fit
every
time
i
sat
down
to
write
i
cried
of
course
said
sophia
to
fossette
she
expects
me
to
go
to
her
instead
of
her
coming
to
me
and
yet
who
the
busiest
but
this
observation
was
not
serious
it
was
merely
a
trifle
of
affectionate
malicious
embroidery
that
sophia
put
on
the
edge
of
her
deep
satisfaction
the
very
spirit
of
simple
love
seemed
to
emanate
from
the
paper
on
which
constance
had
written
and
this
spirit
woke
suddenly
and
completely
sophia
love
for
constance
constance
at
that
moment
there
was
assuredly
for
sophia
no
creature
in
the
world
like
constance
constance
personified
for
her
the
qualities
of
the
baines
family
constance
letter
was
a
great
letter
a
perfect
letter
perfect
in
its
artlessness
the
natural
expression
of
the
baines
character
at
its
best
not
an
awkward
reference
in
the
whole
of
it
no
clumsy
expression
of
surprise
at
anything
that
she
sophia
had
done
or
failed
to
do
no
mention
of
gerald
just
a
sublime
acceptance
of
the
situation
as
it
was
and
the
assurance
of
undiminished
love
tact
no
it
was
something
finer
than
tact
tact
was
conscious
skilful
sophia
was
certain
that
the
notion
of
tactfulness
had
not
entered
head
constance
had
simply
written
out
of
her
heart
and
that
was
what
made
the
letter
so
splendid
sophia
was
convinced
that
no
one
but
a
baines
could
have
written
such
a
letter
she
felt
that
she
must
rise
to
the
height
of
that
letter
that
she
too
must
show
her
baines
blood
and
she
went
primly
to
her
desk
and
began
to
write
on
private
notepaper
in
that
imperious
large
hand
of
hers
that
was
so
different
from
constance
she
began
a
little
stiffly
but
after
a
few
lines
her
generous
and
passionate
soul
was
responding
freely
to
the
appeal
of
constance
she
asked
that
critchlow
should
pay
for
her
to
the
miss
chetwynd
fund
she
spoke
of
her
pension
and
of
paris
and
of
her
pleasure
in
constance
letter
but
she
said
nothing
as
to
gerald
nor
as
to
the
possibility
of
a
visit
to
the
five
towns
she
finished
the
letter
in
a
blaze
of
love
and
passed
from
it
as
from
a
dream
to
the
sterile
banality
of
the
daily
life
of
the
pension
frensham
feeling
that
compared
to
constance
affection
nothing
else
had
any
worth
but
she
would
not
consider
the
project
of
going
to
bursley
never
never
would
she
go
to
bursley
if
constance
chose
to
come
to
paris
and
see
her
she
would
be
delighted
but
she
herself
would
not
budge
the
mere
notion
of
any
change
in
her
existence
intimidated
her
and
as
for
returning
to
bursley
itself
no
no
nevertheless
at
the
pension
frensham
the
future
could
not
be
as
the
past
sophia
health
forbade
that
she
knew
that
the
doctor
was
right
every
time
that
she
made
an
effort
she
knew
intimately
and
speedily
that
the
doctor
was
right
only
her
was
unimpaired
the
machinery
by
which
is
converted
into
action
was
mysteriously
damaged
she
was
aware
of
the
fact
but
she
could
not
face
it
yet
time
would
have
to
elapse
before
she
could
bring
herself
to
face
that
fact
she
was
getting
an
old
woman
she
could
no
longer
draw
on
reserves
yet
she
persisted
to
every
one
that
she
was
quite
recovered
and
was
abstaining
from
her
customary
work
simply
from
an
excess
of
prudence
certainly
her
face
had
recovered
and
the
pension
being
a
machine
all
of
whose
parts
were
in
order
continued
to
run
apparently
with
its
usual
smoothness
it
is
true
that
the
excellent
chef
began
to
peculate
but
as
his
cuisine
did
not
suffer
the
result
was
not
noticeable
for
a
long
period
the
whole
staff
and
many
of
the
guests
knew
that
sophia
had
been
indisposed
and
they
knew
no
more
when
by
hazard
sophia
observed
a
fault
in
the
daily
conduct
of
the
house
her
first
impulse
was
to
go
to
the
root
of
it
and
cure
it
her
second
was
to
leave
it
alone
or
to
palliate
it
by
some
superficial
remedy
unperceived
and
yet
vaguely
suspected
by
various
people
the
decline
of
the
pension
frensham
had
set
in
the
tide
having
risen
to
its
highest
was
receding
but
so
little
that
no
one
could
be
sure
that
it
had
turned
every
now
and
then
it
rushed
up
again
and
washed
the
furthest
stone
sophia
and
constance
exchanged
several
letters
sophia
said
repeatedly
that
she
could
not
leave
paris
at
length
she
roundly
asked
constance
to
come
and
pay
her
a
visit
she
made
the
suggestion
with
fear
for
the
prospect
of
actually
seeing
her
beloved
constance
alarmed
her
but
she
could
do
no
less
than
make
it
and
in
a
few
days
she
had
a
reply
to
say
that
constance
would
have
come
under
cyril
charge
but
that
her
sciatica
was
suddenly
much
worse
and
she
was
obliged
to
lie
down
every
day
after
dinner
to
rest
her
legs
travelling
was
impossible
for
her
the
fates
were
combining
against
sophia
decision
and
now
sophia
began
to
ask
herself
about
her
duty
to
constance
the
truth
was
that
she
was
groping
round
to
find
an
excuse
for
reversing
her
decision
she
was
afraid
to
reverse
it
yet
tempted
she
had
the
desire
to
do
something
which
she
objected
to
doing
it
was
like
the
desire
to
throw
one
self
over
a
high
balcony
it
drew
her
drew
her
and
she
drew
back
against
it
the
pension
was
now
tedious
to
her
it
bored
her
even
to
pretend
to
be
the
supervising
head
of
the
pension
throughout
the
house
discipline
had
loosened
she
wondered
when
mardon
would
renew
his
overtures
for
the
transformation
of
her
enterprise
into
a
limited
company
in
spite
of
herself
she
would
deliberately
cross
his
path
and
give
him
opportunities
to
begin
on
the
old
theme
he
had
never
before
left
her
in
peace
for
so
long
a
period
no
doubt
she
had
upon
his
last
assault
absolutely
convinced
him
that
his
efforts
had
no
smallest
chance
of
success
and
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
cease
them
with
a
single
word
she
could
wind
him
up
again
the
merest
hint
one
day
when
he
was
paying
his
bill
and
he
would
be
beseeching
her
but
she
could
not
utter
the
word
then
she
began
to
say
openly
that
she
did
not
feel
well
that
the
house
was
too
much
for
her
and
that
the
doctor
had
imperatively
commanded
rest
she
said
this
to
every
one
except
mardon
and
every
one
somehow
persisted
in
not
saying
it
to
mardon
the
doctor
having
advised
that
she
should
spend
more
time
in
the
open
air
she
would
take
afternoon
drives
in
the
bois
with
fossette
it
was
october
but
mardon
never
seemed
to
hear
of
those
drives
one
morning
he
met
her
in
the
street
outside
the
house
i
sorry
to
hear
you
so
unwell
he
said
confidentially
after
they
had
discussed
the
health
of
fossette
so
unwell
she
exclaimed
as
if
resenting
the
statement
who
told
you
i
was
so
unwell
jacqueline
she
told
me
you
often
said
that
what
you
needed
was
a
complete
change
and
it
seems
the
doctor
says
so
too
oh
doctors
she
murmured
without
however
denying
the
truth
of
jacqueline
assertion
she
saw
hope
in
mardon
eyes
of
course
you
know
he
said
still
more
confidentially
if
you
should
happen
to
change
your
mind
i
always
ready
to
form
a
little
syndicate
to
take
this
he
waved
discreetly
at
the
pension
off
your
hands
she
shook
her
head
violently
which
was
strange
considering
that
for
weeks
she
had
been
wishing
to
hear
such
words
from
mardon
you
need
give
it
up
altogether
he
said
you
could
retain
your
hold
on
it
we
make
you
manageress
with
a
salary
and
a
share
in
the
profits
you
be
mistress
just
as
much
as
you
are
now
oh
said
she
carelessly
if
gave
it
up
should
give
it
up
entirely
no
half
measures
for
me
with
the
utterance
of
that
sentence
the
history
of
frensham
as
a
private
understanding
was
brought
to
a
close
sophia
knew
it
mardon
knew
it
mardon
heart
leapt
he
saw
in
his
imagination
the
formation
of
the
preliminary
syndicate
with
himself
at
its
head
and
then
the
by
the
syndicate
to
a
limited
company
at
a
profit
he
saw
a
nice
little
profit
for
his
own
private
personal
self
of
a
thousand
or
so
gained
in
a
moment
the
plant
his
hope
which
he
had
deemed
dead
blossomed
with
miraculous
suddenness
well
he
said
give
it
up
entirely
then
take
a
holiday
for
life
you
deserved
it
mrs
scales
she
shook
her
head
once
again
think
it
over
he
said
i
gave
you
my
answer
years
ago
she
said
obstinately
while
fearing
lest
he
should
take
her
at
her
word
oblige
me
by
thinking
it
over
he
said
i
mention
it
to
you
again
in
a
few
days
it
will
be
no
use
she
said
he
took
his
leave
waddling
down
the
street
in
his
vague
clothes
conscious
of
his
fame
as
lewis
mardon
the
great
of
the
champs
elysees
known
throughout
europe
and
america
in
a
few
days
he
did
mention
it
again
there
only
one
thing
that
makes
me
dream
of
it
even
for
a
moment
said
sophia
and
that
is
my
sister
health
your
sister
he
exclaimed
he
did
not
know
she
had
a
sister
never
had
she
spoken
of
her
family
yes
her
letters
are
beginning
to
worry
me
does
she
live
in
paris
no
in
staffordshire
she
has
never
left
home
and
to
preserve
her
pride
intact
she
led
mardon
to
think
that
constance
was
in
a
most
serious
way
whereas
in
truth
constance
had
nothing
worse
than
her
sciatica
and
even
that
was
somewhat
better
thus
she
yielded
chapter
ii
the
meeting
i
soon
after
dinner
one
day
in
the
following
spring
critchlow
knocked
at
constance
door
she
was
seated
in
the
in
front
of
the
fire
in
the
parlour
she
wore
a
large
apron
and
with
the
outlying
parts
of
the
apron
she
was
rubbing
the
moisture
out
of
the
coat
of
a
young
for
whom
no
more
original
name
had
been
found
than
it
is
true
that
he
had
a
spot
constance
had
more
than
once
called
the
world
to
witness
that
she
would
never
have
a
young
dog
again
because
as
she
said
she
could
not
be
always
running
about
after
them
and
they
ate
the
stuffing
out
of
the
furniture
but
her
last
dog
had
lived
too
long
a
dog
can
do
worse
things
than
eat
furniture
and
in
her
natural
reaction
against
age
in
dogs
and
also
in
the
hope
of
postponing
as
long
as
possible
the
inevitable
sorrow
and
upset
which
death
causes
when
it
takes
off
a
domestic
pet
she
had
not
known
how
to
refuse
the
very
desirable
aged
ten
months
that
an
acquaintance
had
offered
to
her
spot
beautiful
pink
skin
could
be
seen
under
his
disturbed
hair
he
was
exquisitely
soft
to
the
touch
and
to
himself
he
was
loathsome
his
eyes
continually
peeped
forth
between
corners
of
the
agitated
towel
and
they
were
full
of
inquietude
and
shame
amy
was
assisting
at
this
performance
gravely
on
the
watch
to
see
that
spot
did
not
escape
into
the
she
opened
the
door
to
critchlow
knock
critchlow
entered
without
any
formalities
as
usual
he
did
not
seem
to
have
changed
he
had
the
same
quantity
of
white
hair
he
wore
the
same
long
white
apron
and
his
voice
which
showed
however
an
occasional
tendency
to
shrillness
had
the
same
grating
quality
he
stood
fairly
straight
he
was
carrying
a
newspaper
in
his
vellum
hand
well
missis
he
said
that
will
do
thank
you
amy
said
constance
quietly
amy
went
slowly
so
ye
washing
him
for
her
said
critchlow
yes
constance
admitted
spot
glanced
sharply
at
the
aged
man
an
ye
seen
this
bit
in
the
paper
about
sophia
he
asked
holding
the
signal
for
her
inspection
about
sophia
cried
constance
what
amiss
nothing
amiss
but
they
got
it
it
in
the
day
by
day
column
here
i
read
it
ye
he
drew
a
long
wooden
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
placed
a
second
pair
of
spectacles
on
his
nose
then
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
his
knees
sticking
out
pointedly
and
read
understand
that
sophia
scales
proprietress
of
the
famous
pension
frensham
in
the
rue
lord
byron
paris
it
that
famous
that
nobody
in
th
five
towns
has
ever
heard
of
it
about
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
native
town
bursley
after
an
absence
of
over
thirty
years
scales
belonged
to
the
and
highly
respected
family
of
baines
she
has
recently
disposed
of
the
pension
frensham
to
a
limited
company
and
we
are
betraying
no
secret
in
stating
that
the
price
paid
ran
well
into
five
figures
so
ye
see
critchlow
commented
how
do
those
signal
people
find
out
things
constance
murmured
eh
bless
ye
i
do
know
said
critchlow
this
was
an
untruth
critchlow
had
himself
given
the
information
to
the
new
editor
of
the
signal
who
had
soon
been
made
aware
of
critchlow
passion
for
the
press
and
who
knew
how
to
make
use
of
it
i
wish
it
had
appeared
just
said
constance
why
oh
i
do
know
i
wish
it
had
well
i
be
touring
on
missis
said
critchlow
meaning
that
he
would
go
he
left
the
paper
and
descended
the
steps
with
senile
deliberation
it
was
characteristic
that
he
had
shown
no
curiosity
whatever
as
to
the
details
of
sophia
arrival
constance
removed
her
apron
wrapped
spot
up
in
it
and
put
him
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
she
then
abruptly
sent
amy
out
to
buy
a
penny
i
thought
you
were
going
by
tram
to
knype
amy
observed
i
have
decided
to
go
by
train
said
constance
with
cold
dignity
as
if
she
had
decided
the
fate
of
nations
she
hated
such
observations
from
amy
who
unfortunately
lacked
in
an
increasing
degree
the
supreme
gift
of
unquestioning
obedience
when
amy
came
breathlessly
back
she
found
constance
in
her
bedroom
withdrawing
crumpled
balls
of
paper
from
the
sleeves
of
her
mantle
constance
scarcely
ever
wore
this
mantle
in
theory
it
was
destined
for
chapel
on
wet
sundays
in
practice
it
had
remained
long
in
the
wardrobe
sundays
having
been
obstinately
fine
for
weeks
and
weeks
together
it
was
a
mantle
that
constance
had
never
really
liked
but
she
was
not
going
to
knype
to
meet
sophia
in
her
everyday
mantle
and
she
had
no
intention
of
donning
her
best
mantle
for
such
an
excursion
to
make
her
first
appearance
before
sophia
in
the
best
mantle
she
had
this
would
have
been
a
sad
mistake
of
tactics
not
only
would
it
have
led
to
an
on
sunday
but
it
would
have
given
to
constance
the
air
of
being
in
awe
of
sophia
now
constance
was
in
truth
a
little
afraid
of
sophia
in
thirty
years
sophia
might
have
grown
into
anything
whereas
constance
had
remained
just
constance
paris
was
a
great
place
and
it
was
immensely
far
off
and
the
mere
sound
of
that
limited
company
business
was
intimidating
imagine
sophia
having
by
her
own
efforts
created
something
which
a
real
limited
company
wanted
to
buy
and
had
bought
yes
constance
was
afraid
but
she
did
not
mean
to
show
her
fear
in
her
mantle
after
all
she
was
the
elder
and
she
had
her
dignity
too
and
a
lot
of
it
tucked
away
in
her
secret
heart
hidden
within
the
mildness
of
that
soft
exterior
so
she
had
decided
on
the
mantle
which
being
seldom
used
had
its
sleeves
stuffed
with
paper
to
the
end
that
they
might
keep
their
shape
and
their
the
little
balls
of
paper
were
strewed
over
the
bed
there
a
train
at
a
quarter
to
three
gets
to
knype
at
ten
minutes
past
said
amy
officiously
but
supposing
it
was
only
three
minutes
late
and
the
london
train
was
prompt
then
you
might
miss
her
happen
you
better
take
the
two
fifteen
to
be
on
the
safe
side
let
me
look
said
constance
firmly
please
put
all
this
paper
in
the
wardrobe
she
would
have
preferred
not
to
follow
amy
suggestion
but
it
was
so
incontestably
wise
that
she
was
obliged
to
accept
it
unless
ye
go
by
tram
said
amy
that
wo
mean
starting
quite
so
soon
but
constance
would
not
go
by
tram
if
she
took
the
tram
she
would
be
bound
to
meet
people
who
had
read
the
signal
and
who
would
say
with
their
stupid
vacuity
going
to
meet
your
sister
at
knype
and
then
tiresome
conversations
would
follow
whereas
in
the
train
she
would
choose
a
compartment
and
would
be
far
less
likely
to
encounter
chatterers
there
was
now
not
a
minute
to
lose
and
the
excitement
which
had
been
growing
in
that
house
for
days
past
under
a
pretence
of
calm
leapt
out
swiftly
into
the
light
of
the
sun
and
was
unashamed
amy
had
to
help
her
mistress
make
herself
as
comely
as
she
could
be
made
without
her
best
dress
mantle
and
bonnet
amy
was
frankly
consulted
as
to
effects
the
barrier
of
class
was
lowered
for
a
space
many
years
had
elapsed
since
constance
had
been
conscious
of
a
keen
desire
to
look
smart
she
was
reminded
of
the
days
when
in
full
fig
for
chapel
she
would
dash
downstairs
on
a
sunday
morning
and
assuming
a
pose
for
inspection
at
the
threshold
of
the
parlour
would
demand
of
samuel
shall
i
do
yes
she
used
to
dash
downstairs
like
a
child
and
yet
in
those
days
she
had
thought
herself
so
sedate
and
mature
she
sighed
half
with
lancinating
regret
and
half
in
gentle
disdain
of
that
mercurial
creature
aged
less
than
thirty
at
she
regarded
herself
as
old
and
she
was
old
and
amy
had
the
tricks
and
manners
of
an
old
spinster
thus
the
excitement
in
the
house
was
an
excitement
and
like
constance
desire
to
look
smart
it
had
its
ridiculous
side
which
was
also
its
tragic
side
the
side
that
would
have
made
a
boor
guffaw
and
a
hysterical
fool
cry
and
a
wise
man
meditate
sadly
upon
the
earth
fashion
of
renewing
itself
at
one
constance
was
dressed
with
the
exception
of
her
gloves
she
looked
at
the
clock
a
second
time
to
make
sure
that
she
might
safely
glance
round
the
house
without
fear
of
missing
the
train
she
went
up
into
the
bedroom
on
the
her
and
sophia
old
bedroom
which
she
had
prepared
with
enormous
care
for
sophia
the
airing
of
that
room
had
been
an
enterprise
of
days
for
save
by
a
minister
during
the
sittings
of
the
wesleyan
methodist
conference
at
bursley
it
had
never
been
occupied
since
the
era
when
maria
insull
used
occasionally
to
sleep
in
the
house
cyril
clung
to
his
old
room
on
his
visits
constance
had
an
ample
supply
of
solid
and
stately
furniture
and
the
chamber
destined
for
sophia
was
lightened
in
every
corner
by
the
reflections
of
polished
mahogany
it
was
also
fairly
impregnated
with
the
odour
of
furniture
paste
an
odour
of
which
no
housewife
need
be
ashamed
further
it
had
been
in
a
delicate
blue
with
one
of
the
new
patterns
it
was
a
room
and
constance
did
not
care
where
sophia
came
from
nor
what
sophia
had
been
accustomed
to
nor
into
what
limited
company
sophia
had
been
transformed
that
room
was
adequate
it
could
not
have
been
improved
upon
you
had
only
to
look
at
the
crocheted
mats
even
those
on
the
washstand
under
the
ewer
and
other
utensils
it
was
folly
to
expose
such
mats
to
the
splashings
of
a
washstand
but
it
was
sublime
folly
sophia
might
remove
them
if
she
cared
constance
was
had
slumbered
within
her
now
it
blazed
forth
a
fire
brightened
the
which
was
a
truly
magnificent
apartment
a
museum
of
valuables
collected
by
the
baines
and
the
maddack
families
since
the
year
tempered
by
the
latest
novelties
in
antimacassars
and
cloths
in
all
bursley
there
could
have
been
few
to
compare
with
constance
constance
knew
it
she
was
not
afraid
of
her
being
seen
by
anybody
she
passed
for
an
instant
into
her
own
bedroom
where
amy
was
patiently
picking
balls
of
paper
from
the
bed
now
you
quite
understand
about
tea
constance
asked
oh
yes
said
amy
as
if
to
say
how
much
oftener
are
you
going
to
ask
me
that
question
are
you
off
now
yes
said
constance
come
and
fasten
the
after
me
they
descended
together
to
the
parlour
a
white
cloth
for
tea
lay
folded
on
the
table
it
was
of
the
finest
damask
that
skill
could
choose
and
money
buy
it
was
fifteen
years
old
and
had
never
been
spread
constance
would
not
have
produced
it
for
the
first
meal
had
she
not
possessed
two
other
of
equal
eminence
on
the
harmonium
were
ranged
several
jams
and
cakes
a
bursley
and
some
pickled
salmon
with
the
necessary
silver
all
was
there
amy
could
not
go
wrong
and
crocuses
were
in
the
vases
on
the
mantelpiece
her
in
the
phrase
which
used
to
cause
samuel
to
think
how
extraordinarily
feminine
she
was
it
was
a
long
time
since
she
had
had
a
on
the
mantelpiece
her
interest
in
her
chronic
sciatica
and
in
her
palpitations
had
grown
at
the
expense
of
her
interest
in
gardens
often
when
she
had
finished
the
complicated
processes
by
which
her
furniture
and
other
goods
were
kept
in
order
she
had
strength
only
to
she
was
rather
a
fragile
small
fat
woman
soon
out
of
breath
easily
marred
this
business
of
preparing
for
the
advent
of
sophia
had
appeared
to
her
genuinely
colossal
however
she
had
come
through
it
very
well
she
was
in
pretty
good
health
only
a
little
tired
and
more
than
a
little
anxious
and
nervous
as
she
gave
the
last
glance
take
away
that
apron
do
she
said
to
amy
pointing
to
the
rough
apron
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
by
the
way
where
is
spot
spot
m
amy
ejaculated
both
their
hearts
jumped
amy
instinctively
looked
out
of
the
window
he
was
there
sure
enough
in
the
gutter
studying
the
indescribabilities
of
king
street
he
had
obviously
escaped
when
amy
came
in
from
buying
the
the
woman
face
was
guilty
amy
i
wonder
at
you
exclaimed
constance
tragically
she
opened
the
door
well
i
never
did
see
the
like
of
that
dog
murmured
amy
spot
his
mistress
commanded
come
here
at
once
do
you
hear
me
spot
turned
sharply
and
gazed
motionless
at
constance
then
with
a
toss
of
the
head
he
dashed
off
to
the
corner
of
the
square
and
gazed
motionless
again
amy
went
forth
to
catch
him
after
an
age
she
brought
him
in
squealing
he
was
in
a
state
exceedingly
offensive
to
the
eye
and
to
the
nose
he
had
effectively
got
rid
of
the
smell
of
soap
which
he
loathed
constance
could
have
wept
it
did
really
appear
to
her
that
nothing
had
gone
right
that
day
and
spot
had
the
most
innocent
trustful
air
impossible
to
make
him
realize
that
his
aunt
sophia
was
coming
he
would
have
sold
his
entire
family
into
servitude
in
order
to
buy
ten
yards
of
king
street
gutter
you
must
wash
him
in
the
scullery
that
all
there
is
for
it
said
constance
controlling
herself
put
that
apron
on
and
do
forget
one
of
your
new
aprons
when
you
open
the
door
better
shut
him
up
in
cyril
bedroom
when
you
dried
him
and
she
went
charged
with
worries
clasping
her
bag
and
her
umbrella
and
smoothing
her
gloves
and
spying
downwards
at
the
folds
of
her
mantle
that
a
funny
way
to
go
to
bursley
station
that
is
said
amy
observing
that
constance
was
descending
king
street
instead
of
crossing
it
into
wedgwood
street
and
she
caught
spot
fair
clout
on
the
head
to
indicate
to
him
that
she
had
him
alone
in
the
house
now
constance
was
taking
a
route
to
the
station
so
that
if
stopped
by
acquaintances
she
should
not
be
too
obviously
going
to
the
station
her
feelings
concerning
the
arrival
of
sophia
and
concerning
the
town
attitude
towards
it
were
very
complex
she
was
forced
to
hurry
and
she
had
risen
that
morning
with
plans
perfectly
contrived
for
the
avoidance
of
hurry
she
disliked
hurry
because
it
always
her
about
ii
the
express
from
london
was
late
so
that
constance
had
of
an
hour
of
the
stony
calmness
of
knype
platform
when
it
is
waiting
for
a
great
train
at
last
the
porters
began
to
cry
macclesfield
stockport
and
manchester
train
the
immense
engine
glided
round
the
curve
dwarfing
the
carriages
behind
it
and
constance
had
a
supreme
tremor
the
calmness
of
the
platform
was
transformed
into
a
melee
little
constance
found
herself
left
on
the
fringe
of
a
physically
agitated
crowd
which
was
apparently
trying
to
scale
a
precipice
surmounted
by
windows
and
doors
from
whose
apertures
looked
forth
defenders
of
the
train
knype
platform
seemed
as
if
it
would
never
be
reduced
to
order
again
and
constance
did
not
estimate
highly
the
chances
of
picking
out
an
unknown
sophia
from
that
welter
she
was
very
seriously
perturbed
all
the
muscles
of
her
face
were
drawn
as
her
gaze
wandered
anxiously
from
end
to
end
of
the
train
presently
she
saw
a
singular
dog
other
people
also
saw
it
it
was
of
the
colour
of
chocolate
it
had
a
head
and
shoulders
richly
covered
with
hair
that
hung
down
in
thousands
of
tufts
like
the
tufts
of
a
modern
mop
such
as
is
bought
in
shops
this
hair
stopped
suddenly
rather
less
than
halfway
along
the
length
of
the
dog
body
the
remainder
of
which
was
naked
and
as
smooth
as
marble
the
effect
was
to
give
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
five
towns
the
impression
that
the
dog
had
forgotten
an
essential
part
of
its
attire
and
was
outraging
decency
the
ball
of
hair
which
had
been
allowed
to
grow
on
the
tail
and
the
circles
of
hair
which
ornamented
its
ankles
only
served
to
intensify
the
impression
of
indecency
a
pink
ribbon
round
its
neck
completed
the
outrage
the
animal
had
absolutely
the
air
of
a
decked
trollop
a
chain
ran
taut
from
the
creature
neck
into
the
middle
of
a
small
crowd
of
persons
gesticulating
over
trunks
and
constance
traced
it
to
a
tall
and
distinguished
woman
in
a
coat
and
skirt
with
a
rather
striking
hat
a
beautiful
and
aristocratic
woman
constance
thought
at
a
distance
then
the
strange
idea
came
to
her
that
sophia
she
was
sure
she
was
not
sure
she
was
sure
the
woman
emerged
from
the
crowd
her
eye
fell
on
constance
they
both
hesitated
and
as
it
were
wavered
uncertainly
towards
each
other
i
should
have
known
you
anywhere
said
sophia
with
apparently
careless
tranquillity
as
she
stooped
to
kiss
constance
raising
her
veil
constance
saw
that
this
marvellous
tranquillity
must
be
imitated
and
she
imitated
it
very
well
it
was
a
tranquillity
but
she
noticed
a
twitching
of
her
sister
lips
the
twitching
comforted
constance
proving
to
her
that
she
was
not
alone
in
foolishness
there
was
also
something
queer
about
the
permanent
lines
of
sophia
mouth
that
must
be
due
to
the
about
which
sophia
had
written
did
cyril
meet
you
asked
constance
it
was
all
that
she
could
think
of
to
say
oh
yes
said
sophia
eagerly
and
i
went
to
his
studio
and
he
saw
me
off
at
euston
he
is
a
very
nice
boy
i
love
him
she
said
love
him
with
the
intonation
of
sophia
aged
fifteen
her
tone
and
imperious
gesture
sent
constance
flying
back
to
the
she
has
altered
one
bit
constance
thought
with
joy
nothing
could
change
sophia
and
at
the
back
of
that
notion
was
a
more
general
notion
nothing
could
change
a
baines
it
was
true
that
sophia
had
not
changed
powerful
individualities
remain
undisfigured
by
no
matter
what
vicissitudes
after
this
revelation
of
the
original
sophia
arising
as
it
did
out
of
praise
of
cyril
constance
felt
easier
felt
reassured
this
is
fossette
said
sophia
pulling
at
the
chain
constance
knew
not
what
to
reply
surely
sophia
could
not
be
aware
what
she
did
in
bringing
such
a
dog
to
a
place
where
people
were
so
particular
as
they
are
in
the
five
towns
fossette
she
repeated
the
name
in
an
endearing
accent
half
stooping
towards
the
dog
after
all
it
was
not
the
dog
fault
sophia
had
certainly
mentioned
a
dog
in
her
letters
but
she
had
not
prepared
constance
for
the
spectacle
of
fossette
all
that
happened
in
a
moment
a
porter
appeared
with
two
trunks
belonging
to
sophia
constance
observed
that
they
were
superlatively
trunks
also
that
sophia
clothes
though
the
showy
side
were
superlatively
the
getting
of
sophia
ticket
to
bursley
occupied
them
next
and
soon
the
first
shock
of
meeting
had
worn
off
in
a
compartment
of
the
loop
line
train
with
sophia
and
fossette
opposite
to
her
constance
had
leisure
to
in
sophia
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
despite
her
slenderness
and
straightness
and
the
general
effect
of
the
long
oval
of
her
face
under
the
hat
sophia
looked
her
age
she
saw
that
sophia
must
have
been
through
a
great
deal
her
experiences
were
damagingly
printed
in
the
details
of
feature
seen
at
a
distance
she
might
have
passed
for
a
woman
of
thirty
even
for
a
girl
but
seen
across
a
narrow
railway
carriage
she
was
a
woman
whom
suffering
had
aged
yet
obviously
her
spirit
was
unbroken
hear
her
tell
a
doubtful
porter
that
of
course
she
should
take
fossette
with
her
into
the
carriage
see
her
shut
the
carriage
door
with
the
expressed
intention
of
keeping
other
people
out
she
was
accustomed
to
command
at
the
same
time
her
face
had
an
almost
set
smile
as
though
she
had
said
to
herself
i
will
die
smiling
constance
felt
sorry
for
her
while
recognizing
in
sophia
a
superior
in
charm
in
experience
in
knowledge
of
the
world
and
in
force
of
personality
she
yet
with
a
kind
of
undisturbed
fundamental
superiority
felt
sorry
for
sophia
what
do
you
think
said
sophia
absently
fingering
fossette
a
man
came
up
to
me
at
euston
while
cyril
was
getting
my
ticket
and
said
miss
baines
i
have
seen
ye
for
over
thirty
years
but
i
know
you
miss
baines
or
were
and
you
looking
bonny
then
he
went
off
i
think
it
must
have
been
holl
the
grocer
had
he
got
a
long
white
beard
yes
then
it
was
holl
he
been
mayor
twice
he
an
alderman
you
know
really
said
sophia
but
was
it
queer
eh
bless
us
exclaimed
constance
do
talk
about
queer
terrible
how
time
flies
the
conversation
stopped
and
it
refused
to
start
again
two
women
who
are
full
of
affectionate
curiosity
about
each
other
and
who
have
not
seen
each
other
for
thirty
years
and
who
are
anxious
to
confide
in
each
other
ought
to
discover
no
difficulty
in
talking
but
somehow
these
two
could
not
talk
constance
perceived
that
sophia
was
impeded
by
the
same
awkwardness
as
herself
well
i
never
cried
sophia
suddenly
she
had
glanced
out
of
the
window
and
had
seen
two
camels
and
an
elephant
in
a
field
close
to
the
line
amid
manufactories
and
warehouses
and
advertisements
of
soap
oh
said
constance
that
barnum
you
know
they
have
what
they
call
a
central
depot
here
because
it
the
middle
of
england
constance
spoke
proudly
after
all
there
can
be
only
one
middle
it
was
on
her
tongue
to
say
in
her
manner
that
fossette
ought
to
be
with
the
camels
but
she
refrained
sophia
hit
on
the
excellent
idea
of
noting
all
the
buildings
that
were
new
to
her
and
all
the
landmarks
that
she
remembered
it
was
surprising
how
little
the
district
had
altered
same
smoke
said
sophia
same
smoke
constance
agreed
it
even
worse
said
sophia
do
you
think
so
constance
was
slightly
piqued
but
they
doing
something
now
for
smoke
abatement
i
must
have
forgotten
how
dirty
it
was
said
sophia
i
suppose
that
it
i
no
idea
really
said
constance
then
in
candid
admission
the
fact
is
it
is
dirty
you
ca
imagine
what
work
it
makes
especially
with
as
the
train
puffed
under
trafalgar
road
constance
pointed
to
a
new
station
that
was
being
built
there
to
be
called
station
wo
it
be
strange
said
she
accustomed
to
the
eternal
sequence
of
loop
lane
stations
turnhill
bursley
bleakridge
hanbridge
cauldon
knype
trent
vale
and
longshaw
a
road
inserting
itself
between
bleakridge
and
hanbridge
seemed
to
her
excessively
curious
yes
i
suppose
it
will
sophia
agreed
but
of
course
it
not
the
same
to
you
said
constance
dashed
she
indicated
the
glories
of
bursley
park
as
the
train
slackened
for
bursley
with
modesty
sophia
gazed
and
vaguely
recognized
the
slopes
where
she
had
taken
her
first
walk
with
gerald
scales
nobody
accosted
them
at
bursley
station
and
they
drove
to
the
square
in
a
cab
amy
was
at
the
window
she
held
up
spot
who
was
in
a
plenary
state
of
cleanliness
rivalling
the
purity
of
amy
apron
good
afternoon
m
said
amy
officiously
to
sophia
as
sophia
came
up
the
steps
good
afternoon
amy
sophia
replied
she
flattered
amy
in
thus
showing
that
she
was
acquainted
with
her
name
but
if
ever
a
servant
was
put
into
her
place
by
mere
tone
amy
was
put
into
her
place
on
that
occasion
constance
trembled
at
sophia
frigid
and
arrogant
politeness
certainly
sophia
was
not
used
to
being
addressed
first
by
servants
but
amy
was
not
quite
the
ordinary
servant
she
was
much
older
than
the
ordinary
servant
and
she
had
acquired
a
partial
moral
dominion
over
constance
though
constance
would
have
warmly
denied
it
hence
constance
apprehension
however
nothing
happened
amy
apparently
did
not
feel
the
snub
take
spot
and
put
him
in
cyril
bedroom
constance
murmured
to
her
as
if
implying
have
i
not
already
told
you
to
do
that
the
fact
was
she
was
afraid
for
spot
life
now
fossette
she
welcomed
the
incoming
poodle
kindly
the
poodle
began
at
once
to
sniff
the
fat
red
cabman
was
handling
the
trunks
on
the
pavement
and
amy
was
upstairs
for
a
moment
the
sisters
were
alone
together
in
the
parlour
so
here
i
am
exclaimed
the
tall
majestic
woman
of
fifty
and
her
lips
twitched
again
as
she
looked
round
the
room
so
small
to
her
yes
here
you
are
constance
agreed
she
bit
her
lip
and
as
a
measure
of
prudence
to
avoid
breaking
down
she
bustled
out
to
the
cabman
a
passing
instant
of
emotion
like
a
fleck
of
foam
on
a
wide
and
calm
sea
the
cabman
blundered
up
and
downstairs
with
trunks
and
saluted
sophia
haughty
generosity
and
then
there
was
quietness
amy
was
already
brewing
the
tea
in
the
cave
the
prepared
in
front
of
the
fire
made
a
glittering
array
now
what
about
fossette
constance
voiced
anxieties
that
had
been
growing
on
her
fossette
will
be
quite
right
with
me
said
sophia
firmly
they
ascended
to
the
guest
room
which
drew
sophia
admiration
for
its
prettiness
she
hurried
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
square
would
you
like
a
fire
constance
asked
in
a
rather
perfunctory
manner
for
a
bedroom
fire
in
seasons
of
normal
health
was
still
regarded
as
absurd
in
the
square
oh
no
said
sophia
but
with
a
slight
failure
to
rebut
the
suggestion
as
utterly
ridiculous
sure
constance
questioned
quite
thank
you
said
sophia
well
i
leave
you
i
expect
amy
will
have
tea
ready
directly
she
went
down
into
the
kitchen
amy
she
said
as
soon
as
we
finished
tea
light
a
fire
in
scales
bedroom
in
the
top
bedroom
m
yes
constance
climbed
again
to
her
own
bedroom
and
shut
the
door
she
needed
a
moment
to
herself
in
the
midst
of
this
terrific
affair
she
sighed
with
relief
as
she
removed
her
mantle
she
thought
at
any
rate
we
met
and
i
got
her
here
she
very
nice
no
she
is
a
bit
altered
she
hesitated
to
admit
that
to
her
sophia
was
the
least
in
the
world
formidable
and
so
she
said
once
more
she
very
nice
she
is
a
bit
altered
and
then
fancy
her
being
here
she
really
is
here
with
her
perfect
simplicity
it
did
not
occur
to
constance
to
speculate
as
to
what
sophia
thought
of
her
sophia
was
downstairs
first
and
constance
found
her
looking
at
the
blank
wall
beyond
the
door
leading
to
the
kitchen
steps
so
this
is
where
you
had
it
bricked
up
said
sophia
yes
said
constance
that
the
place
it
makes
me
feel
like
people
feel
when
they
have
tickling
in
a
limb
that
been
cut
off
said
sophia
oh
sophia
the
tea
received
a
great
deal
of
praise
from
sophia
but
neither
of
them
ate
much
constance
found
that
sophia
was
like
herself
she
had
to
be
particular
about
her
food
she
tasted
dainties
for
the
sake
of
tasting
but
it
was
a
bird
pecking
not
the
twelfth
part
of
the
tea
was
consumed
they
dared
not
indulge
caprices
only
their
eyes
could
feed
after
tea
they
went
up
to
the
and
in
the
corridor
had
the
startling
pleasure
of
seeing
two
dogs
who
scurried
about
after
each
other
in
amity
spot
had
found
fossette
with
the
aid
of
incurable
carelessness
and
had
at
once
examined
her
with
great
particularity
she
seemed
to
be
of
an
amiable
disposition
and
not
averse
from
the
lighter
distractions
for
a
long
time
the
sisters
sat
chatting
together
in
the
lit
to
the
agreeable
sound
of
happy
dogs
playing
in
the
dark
corridor
those
dogs
saved
the
situation
because
they
needed
constant
attention
when
the
dogs
dozed
the
sisters
began
to
look
through
photograph
albums
of
which
constance
had
several
bound
in
plush
or
morocco
nothing
will
sharpen
the
memory
evoke
the
past
raise
the
dead
rejuvenate
the
ageing
and
cause
both
sighs
and
smiles
like
a
collection
of
photographs
gathered
together
during
long
years
of
life
constance
had
an
astonishing
menagerie
of
unknown
cousins
and
their
connections
and
of
townspeople
she
had
cyril
at
all
ages
she
had
weird
daguerreotypes
of
her
parents
and
their
parents
the
strangest
of
all
was
a
portrait
of
samuel
povey
as
an
infant
in
arms
sophia
checked
an
impulse
to
laugh
at
it
but
when
constance
said
is
it
funny
she
did
allow
herself
to
laugh
a
photograph
of
samuel
in
the
year
before
his
death
was
really
imposing
sophia
stared
at
it
impressed
it
was
the
portrait
of
an
honest
man
how
long
have
you
been
a
widow
constance
asked
in
a
low
voice
glancing
at
upright
sophia
over
her
spectacles
a
leaf
of
the
album
raised
against
her
finger
sophia
unmistakably
flushed
i
do
know
that
i
am
a
widow
said
she
with
an
air
my
husband
left
me
in
and
i
never
seen
nor
heard
of
him
since
oh
my
dear
cried
constance
alarmed
and
deafened
as
by
a
clap
of
awful
thunder
i
thought
ye
were
a
widow
said
he
was
told
positively
ye
were
a
widow
that
why
i
never
she
stopped
her
face
was
troubled
of
course
i
always
passed
for
a
widow
over
there
said
sophia
of
course
said
constance
quickly
i
see
and
i
may
be
a
widow
said
sophia
constance
made
no
remark
this
was
a
blow
bursley
was
such
a
particular
place
doubtless
gerald
scales
had
behaved
like
a
scoundrel
that
was
sure
when
immediately
afterwards
amy
opened
the
door
having
first
knocked
the
practice
of
encouraging
a
servant
to
plunge
without
warning
of
any
kind
into
a
had
never
been
favoured
in
that
house
she
saw
the
sisters
sitting
rather
near
to
each
other
at
the
walnut
oval
table
scales
very
upright
and
staring
into
the
fire
and
povey
up
and
staring
at
the
photograph
album
both
seeming
to
amy
aged
and
apprehensive
povey
hair
was
quite
grey
though
scales
hair
was
nearly
as
black
as
amy
own
scales
started
at
the
sound
of
the
knock
and
turned
her
head
here
and
critchlow
m
announced
amy
the
sisters
glanced
at
one
another
with
lifted
foreheads
then
povey
spoke
to
amy
as
though
visits
at
eight
at
night
were
a
customary
phenomenon
of
the
household
nevertheless
she
trembled
to
think
what
outrageous
thing
critchlow
might
say
to
sophia
after
thirty
years
absence
the
occasion
was
great
and
it
might
also
be
terrible
ask
them
to
come
up
she
said
calmly
but
amy
had
the
best
of
that
encounter
i
have
done
she
replied
and
instantly
produced
them
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
corridor
it
was
providential
the
sisters
had
made
no
remark
that
the
critchlows
might
not
hear
then
maria
critchlow
simpering
had
to
greet
sophia
critchlow
was
very
agitated
from
sheer
nervousness
she
curvetted
she
almost
pranced
and
she
made
noises
with
her
mouth
as
though
she
saw
some
one
eating
a
sour
apple
she
wanted
to
show
sophia
how
greatly
she
had
changed
from
the
young
timid
apprentice
certainly
since
her
marriage
she
had
changed
as
manager
of
other
people
business
she
had
not
felt
the
necessity
of
being
effusive
to
customers
but
as
proprietress
anxiety
to
succeed
had
dragged
her
out
of
her
capable
and
mechanical
indifference
it
was
a
pity
her
consistent
dullness
had
had
a
sort
of
dignity
but
genial
she
was
merely
ridiculous
animation
cruelly
displayed
her
appalling
commonness
and
physical
shabbiness
demeanour
was
not
chilly
but
it
indicated
that
sophia
had
no
wish
to
be
eyed
over
as
a
freak
of
nature
critchlow
advanced
very
slowly
into
the
room
ye
still
carry
your
head
on
a
stiff
neck
said
he
deliberately
examining
sophia
then
with
great
care
he
put
out
his
long
thin
arm
and
took
her
hand
well
i
rare
and
glad
to
see
ye
every
one
was
thunderstruck
at
this
expression
of
joy
critchlow
had
never
been
known
to
be
glad
to
see
anybody
yes
twittered
maria
critchlow
would
come
in
nothing
would
do
but
he
must
come
in
you
did
tell
me
this
afternoon
said
constance
that
you
were
going
to
give
us
the
pleasure
of
your
company
like
this
he
looked
momentarily
at
constance
no
he
grated
i
do
know
as
i
did
his
gaze
flattered
sophia
evidently
he
treated
this
experienced
and
sad
woman
of
fifty
as
a
young
girl
and
in
presence
of
his
extreme
age
she
felt
like
a
young
girl
remembering
the
while
how
as
a
young
girl
she
had
hated
him
repulsing
the
assistance
of
his
wife
he
arranged
an
armchair
in
front
of
the
fire
and
meticulously
put
himself
into
it
assuredly
he
was
much
older
in
a
than
behind
the
counter
of
his
shop
constance
had
noticed
that
in
the
afternoon
a
live
coal
fell
out
of
the
fire
he
bent
forward
wet
his
fingers
picked
up
the
coal
and
threw
it
back
into
the
fire
well
said
sophia
i
would
have
done
that
i
never
saw
critchlow
equal
for
picking
up
hot
cinders
maria
giggled
critchlow
deigned
no
remark
when
did
ye
leave
this
paris
he
demanded
of
sophia
leaning
back
and
putting
his
hands
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
yesterday
morning
said
sophia
and
ye
been
doing
with
yeself
since
yesterday
morning
i
spent
last
night
in
london
sophia
replied
oh
in
london
did
ye
yes
cyril
and
i
had
an
evening
together
eh
cyril
what
yer
opinion
o
cyril
sophia
i
very
proud
to
have
cyril
for
a
nephew
said
sophia
oh
are
ye
the
old
man
was
obviously
ironic
yes
i
am
sophia
insisted
sharply
i
not
going
to
hear
a
word
said
against
cyril
she
proceeded
to
an
enthusiastic
laudation
of
cyril
which
rather
overwhelmed
his
mother
constance
was
pleased
she
was
delighted
and
yet
somewhere
in
her
mind
was
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
cyril
having
taken
a
fancy
to
his
brilliant
aunt
had
tried
to
charm
her
as
he
seldom
or
never
tried
to
charm
his
mother
cyril
and
sophia
had
dazzled
and
conquered
each
other
they
were
of
the
same
type
whereas
she
constance
being
but
a
plain
person
could
not
glitter
she
rang
the
bell
and
gave
instructions
to
amy
about
food
fruit
cakes
coffee
and
hot
milk
on
a
tray
and
sophia
also
spoke
to
amy
murmuring
a
request
as
to
fossette
yes
scales
said
amy
with
eager
deference
critchlow
smiled
vaguely
from
a
low
chair
near
the
curtained
window
then
constance
lit
another
burner
of
the
chandelier
in
doing
so
she
gave
a
little
sigh
it
was
a
sigh
of
relief
critchlow
had
behaved
himself
now
that
he
and
sophia
had
met
the
worst
was
over
had
constance
known
beforehand
that
he
would
pay
a
call
she
would
have
been
agonized
by
apprehensions
but
now
that
he
had
actually
come
she
was
glad
he
had
come
when
he
had
silently
sipped
some
hot
milk
he
drew
a
thick
bunch
of
papers
white
and
blue
from
his
bulging
now
maria
critchlow
he
called
edging
round
his
chair
slightly
ye
best
go
back
home
maria
critchlow
was
biting
at
a
bit
of
walnut
cake
while
in
her
right
hand
all
seamed
with
black
lines
she
held
a
cup
of
coffee
but
mr
critchlow
constance
protested
i
got
business
with
sophia
and
i
must
get
it
done
i
got
for
to
render
an
account
of
my
stewardship
to
sophia
under
her
father
will
and
her
mother
will
and
her
aunt
will
and
it
nobody
business
but
mine
and
sophia
i
reckon
now
then
he
glanced
at
his
wife
off
with
ye
maria
rose
and
surely
you
do
want
to
go
into
all
that
said
sophia
she
spoke
softly
for
she
had
already
fully
perceived
that
critchlow
must
be
managed
with
the
tact
which
the
capricious
obstinacies
of
advanced
age
demanded
surely
you
can
wait
a
day
or
two
i
in
no
hurry
have
i
waited
long
enough
he
retorted
fiercely
there
was
a
pause
maria
critchlow
moved
as
for
you
being
in
no
hurry
sophia
the
old
man
went
on
nobody
can
say
as
you
been
in
a
hurry
sophia
had
suffered
a
check
she
glanced
hesitatingly
at
constance
critchlow
and
i
will
go
down
into
the
parlour
said
constance
quickly
there
is
a
bit
of
fire
there
oh
no
i
wo
hear
of
such
a
thing
yes
we
will
wo
we
mrs
critchlow
constance
insisted
cheerfully
but
firmly
she
was
determined
that
in
her
house
sophia
should
have
all
the
freedom
and
conveniences
that
she
could
have
had
in
her
own
if
a
private
room
was
needed
for
discussions
between
sophia
and
her
trustee
constance
pride
was
piqued
to
supply
that
room
further
constance
was
glad
to
get
maria
out
of
sophia
sight
she
was
accustomed
to
maria
with
her
it
did
not
matter
but
she
did
not
care
that
the
teeth
of
sophia
should
be
set
on
edge
by
the
ridiculous
demeanour
of
maria
so
those
two
left
the
and
the
old
man
began
to
open
the
papers
which
he
had
been
preparing
for
weeks
there
was
very
little
fire
in
the
parlour
and
constance
in
addition
to
being
bored
by
critchlow
inane
and
inquisitive
remarks
felt
chilly
which
was
bad
for
her
sciatica
she
wondered
whether
sophia
would
have
to
confess
to
critchlow
that
she
was
not
certainly
a
widow
she
thought
that
steps
ought
to
be
taken
to
ascertain
through
birkinshaws
if
anything
was
known
of
gerald
scales
but
even
that
course
was
set
with
perils
supposing
that
he
still
lived
an
unspeakable
villain
constance
could
only
think
of
him
as
an
unspeakable
villain
and
supposing
that
he
molested
sophia
what
scenes
what
shame
in
the
town
such
frightful
thoughts
ran
endlessly
through
constance
mind
as
she
bent
over
the
fire
endeavouring
to
keep
alive
a
silly
conversation
with
maria
critchlow
amy
passed
through
the
parlour
to
go
to
bed
there
was
no
other
way
of
reaching
the
upper
part
of
the
house
are
you
going
to
bed
amy
yes
where
is
fossette
in
the
kitchen
m
said
amy
defending
herself
scales
told
me
the
dog
might
sleep
in
the
kitchen
with
spot
as
they
was
such
good
friends
i
opened
the
bottom
drawer
and
fossit
is
lying
in
that
scales
has
brought
a
dog
with
her
exclaimed
maria
yes
said
amy
drily
before
constance
could
answer
she
implied
everything
in
that
affirmative
you
are
a
family
for
dogs
said
maria
what
sort
of
dog
is
it
well
said
constance
i
do
know
exactly
what
they
call
it
it
a
french
dog
one
of
those
french
dogs
amy
was
lingering
at
the
stairfoot
good
night
amy
thank
you
amy
ascended
shutting
the
door
oh
i
see
maria
muttered
well
i
never
it
was
ten
before
sounds
above
indicated
that
the
first
interview
between
trustee
and
beneficiary
was
finished
i
be
going
on
to
open
our
said
maria
say
good
night
to
scales
for
me
she
was
not
sure
whether
charles
critchlow
had
really
meant
her
to
go
home
or
whether
her
mere
absence
from
the
had
contented
him
so
she
departed
he
came
down
the
stairs
with
the
most
tiresome
slowness
went
through
the
parlour
in
silence
ignoring
constance
and
also
sophia
who
was
at
his
heels
and
vanished
as
constance
shut
and
bolted
the
the
sisters
looked
at
each
other
sophia
faintly
smiling
it
seemed
to
them
that
they
understood
each
other
better
when
they
did
not
speak
with
a
glance
they
exchanged
their
ideas
on
the
subject
of
charles
critchlow
and
maria
and
learnt
that
their
ideas
were
similar
constance
said
nothing
as
to
the
private
interview
nor
did
sophia
at
present
on
this
the
first
day
they
could
only
achieve
intimacy
by
intermittent
flashes
what
about
bed
asked
sophia
you
must
be
tired
said
constance
sophia
got
to
the
stairs
which
received
a
little
light
from
the
corridor
gas
before
constance
having
tested
the
turned
out
the
gas
in
the
parlour
they
climbed
the
lower
flight
of
stairs
together
i
must
just
see
that
your
room
is
all
right
constance
said
must
you
sophia
smiled
they
climbed
the
second
flight
slowly
constance
was
out
of
breath
oh
a
fire
how
nice
cried
sophia
but
why
did
you
go
to
all
that
trouble
i
told
you
not
to
it
no
trouble
at
all
said
constance
raising
the
gas
in
the
bedroom
her
tone
implied
that
bedroom
fires
were
a
quite
ordinary
incident
of
daily
life
in
a
place
like
bursley
well
my
dear
i
hope
you
find
everything
comfortable
said
constance
i
sure
i
shall
good
night
dear
good
night
then
they
looked
at
each
other
again
with
timid
affectionateness
they
did
not
kiss
the
thought
in
both
their
minds
was
we
could
keep
on
kissing
every
day
but
there
was
a
vast
amount
of
quiet
restrained
affection
of
mutual
confidence
and
respect
even
of
tenderness
in
their
tones
about
half
an
hour
later
a
dreadful
hullaballoo
smote
the
ear
of
constance
she
was
just
getting
into
bed
she
listened
intently
in
great
alarm
it
was
undoubtedly
those
dogs
fighting
and
fighting
to
the
death
she
pictured
the
kitchen
as
a
battlefield
and
spot
slain
opening
the
door
she
stepped
out
into
the
corridor
constance
said
a
low
voice
above
her
she
jumped
is
that
you
yes
well
do
bother
to
go
down
to
the
dogs
they
stop
in
a
moment
fossette
wo
bite
i
so
sorry
she
upsetting
the
house
constance
stared
upwards
and
discerned
a
pale
shadow
the
dogs
did
soon
cease
their
altercation
this
short
colloquy
in
the
dark
affected
constance
strangely
iii
the
next
morning
after
a
night
varied
by
periods
of
wakefulness
not
unpleasant
sophia
arose
and
taking
due
precautions
against
cold
went
to
the
window
it
was
saturday
she
had
left
paris
on
the
thursday
she
looked
forth
upon
the
square
holding
aside
the
blind
she
had
expected
of
course
to
find
that
the
square
had
shrunk
in
size
but
nevertheless
she
was
startled
to
see
how
small
it
was
it
seemed
to
her
scarcely
bigger
than
a
courtyard
she
could
remember
a
winter
morning
when
from
the
window
she
had
watched
the
square
under
virgin
snow
in
the
lamplight
and
the
square
had
been
vast
and
the
first
wayfarer
crossing
it
diagonally
and
leaving
behind
him
the
irregular
impress
of
his
feet
had
appeared
to
travel
for
hours
over
an
interminable
white
waste
before
vanishing
past
holl
shop
in
the
direction
of
the
town
hall
she
chiefly
recalled
the
square
under
snow
cold
mornings
and
the
coldness
of
the
at
the
window
and
the
draught
of
cold
air
through
the
sash
it
was
put
right
now
these
visions
of
herself
seemed
beautiful
to
her
her
childish
existence
seemed
beautiful
the
storms
and
tempests
of
her
girlhood
seemed
beautiful
even
the
great
sterile
expanse
of
tedium
when
after
giving
up
a
scholastic
career
she
had
served
for
two
years
in
the
shop
even
this
had
a
strange
charm
in
her
memory
and
she
thought
that
not
for
millions
of
pounds
would
she
live
her
life
over
again
in
its
contents
the
square
had
not
surprisingly
changed
during
the
immense
the
terrifying
interval
that
separated
her
from
her
virginity
on
the
east
side
several
shops
had
been
thrown
into
one
and
forced
into
a
semblance
of
eternal
unity
by
means
of
a
coat
of
stucco
and
there
was
a
fountain
at
the
north
end
which
was
new
to
her
no
other
constructional
change
but
the
moral
change
the
sad
declension
from
the
ancient
proud
spirit
of
the
square
this
was
painfully
depressing
several
establishments
lacked
tenants
had
obviously
lacked
tenants
for
a
long
time
let
notices
hung
in
their
stained
and
dirty
upper
windows
and
clung
insecurely
to
their
closed
shutters
and
on
the
of
these
establishments
were
names
that
sophia
did
not
know
the
character
of
most
of
the
shops
seemed
to
have
worsened
they
had
become
pettifogging
little
holes
unkempt
shabby
poor
they
had
no
brightness
no
feeling
of
vitality
and
the
floor
of
the
square
was
littered
with
nondescript
refuse
the
whole
scene
paltry
confined
and
dull
reached
for
her
the
extreme
of
provinciality
it
was
what
the
french
called
with
a
pregnant
intonation
la
province
this
being
said
there
was
nothing
else
to
say
bursley
of
course
was
in
the
provinces
bursley
must
in
the
nature
of
things
be
typically
provincial
but
in
her
mind
it
had
always
been
differentiated
from
the
common
province
it
had
always
had
an
air
a
distinction
and
especially
luke
square
that
illusion
was
now
gone
still
the
alteration
was
not
wholly
in
herself
it
was
not
wholly
subjective
the
square
really
had
changed
for
the
worse
it
might
not
be
smaller
but
it
had
deteriorated
as
a
centre
of
commerce
it
had
assuredly
approached
very
near
to
death
on
a
saturday
morning
thirty
years
ago
it
would
have
been
covered
with
stalls
and
chattering
and
the
stir
of
bargains
now
saturday
morning
was
like
any
other
morning
in
the
square
and
the
of
market
in
wedgwood
street
which
she
could
see
from
her
window
echoed
to
the
sounds
of
noisy
commerce
in
that
instance
business
had
simply
moved
a
few
yards
to
the
east
but
sophia
knew
from
hints
in
constance
letters
and
in
her
talk
that
business
in
general
had
moved
more
than
a
few
yards
it
had
moved
a
couple
of
miles
to
arrogant
and
pushing
hanbridge
with
its
electric
light
and
its
theatres
and
its
big
advertising
shops
the
heaven
of
thick
smoke
over
the
square
the
black
deposit
on
painted
woodwork
the
intermittent
hooting
of
steam
syrens
showed
that
the
wholesale
trade
of
bursley
still
flourished
but
sophia
had
no
memories
of
the
wholesale
trade
of
bursley
it
meant
nothing
to
the
youth
of
her
heart
she
was
attached
by
intimate
links
to
the
retail
traffic
of
bursley
and
as
a
mart
old
bursley
was
done
for
she
thought
it
would
kill
me
if
i
had
to
live
here
it
deadening
it
weighs
on
you
and
the
dirt
and
the
horrible
ugliness
and
the
way
they
talk
and
the
way
they
think
i
felt
it
first
at
knype
station
the
square
is
rather
picturesque
but
it
such
a
poor
poor
little
thing
fancy
having
to
look
at
it
every
morning
of
one
life
no
she
almost
shuddered
for
the
time
being
she
had
no
home
to
constance
she
was
a
visit
constance
did
not
appear
to
realize
the
awful
conditions
of
dirt
decay
and
provinciality
in
which
she
was
living
even
house
was
extremely
inconvenient
dark
and
no
doubt
unhealthy
no
hall
abominable
stairs
and
as
to
hygiene
simply
mediaeval
she
could
not
understand
why
constance
had
remained
in
the
house
constance
had
plenty
of
money
and
might
live
where
she
liked
and
in
a
good
modern
house
yet
she
stayed
in
the
square
i
daresay
she
got
used
to
it
sophia
thought
leniently
i
daresay
i
should
be
just
the
same
in
her
place
but
she
did
not
really
think
so
and
she
could
not
understand
constance
state
of
mind
certainly
she
could
not
claim
to
have
up
constance
yet
she
considered
that
her
sister
was
in
some
respects
utterly
provincial
what
they
used
to
call
in
the
five
towns
a
somewhat
too
diffident
not
assertive
enough
not
erect
enough
with
curious
provincial
pronunciations
accents
gestures
mannerisms
and
inarticulate
ejaculations
with
a
curious
narrowness
of
outlook
but
at
the
same
time
constance
was
very
shrewd
and
she
was
often
proving
by
some
bit
of
a
remark
that
she
knew
what
was
what
despite
her
provinciality
in
judgments
upon
human
nature
they
undoubtedly
thought
alike
and
there
was
a
strong
natural
general
sympathy
between
them
and
at
the
bottom
of
constance
was
something
fine
at
intervals
sophia
discovered
herself
secretly
patronizing
constance
but
reflection
would
always
cause
her
to
cease
from
patronage
and
to
examine
her
own
defences
constance
besides
being
the
essence
of
kindness
was
no
fool
constance
could
see
through
a
pretence
an
absurdity
as
quickly
as
any
one
constance
did
honestly
appear
to
sophia
to
be
superior
to
any
frenchwoman
that
she
had
ever
encountered
she
saw
supreme
in
constance
that
quality
which
she
had
recognized
in
the
porters
at
newhaven
on
landing
the
quality
of
an
honest
and
naive
goodwill
of
powerful
simplicity
that
quality
presented
itself
to
her
as
the
greatest
in
the
world
and
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
very
air
of
england
she
could
even
detect
it
in
critchlow
whom
for
the
rest
she
liked
admiring
the
brutal
force
of
his
character
she
pardoned
his
brutality
to
his
wife
she
found
it
proper
after
all
she
said
supposing
he
had
married
her
what
would
she
have
been
nothing
but
a
slave
she
infinitely
better
off
as
his
wife
in
fact
she
lucky
and
it
would
be
absurd
for
him
to
treat
her
otherwise
than
he
does
treat
her
sophia
did
not
divine
that
her
masterful
critchlow
had
once
wanted
maria
as
one
might
want
a
star
but
to
be
always
with
such
people
to
be
always
with
constance
to
be
always
in
the
bursley
atmosphere
physical
and
mental
she
pictured
paris
as
it
would
be
on
that
very
morning
bright
clean
glittering
the
neatness
of
the
rue
lord
byron
and
the
magnificent
slanting
splendour
of
the
champs
elysees
paris
had
always
seemed
beautiful
to
her
but
the
life
of
paris
had
not
seemed
beautiful
to
her
yet
now
it
did
seem
beautiful
she
could
delve
down
into
the
earlier
years
of
her
ownership
of
the
pension
and
see
a
regular
placid
beauty
in
her
daily
life
there
her
life
there
even
so
late
as
a
fortnight
ago
seemed
beautiful
sad
but
beautiful
it
had
passed
into
history
she
sighed
when
she
thought
of
the
innumerable
interviews
with
mardon
the
endless
formalities
required
by
the
english
and
the
french
law
and
by
the
particularity
of
the
syndicate
she
had
been
through
all
that
she
had
actually
been
through
it
and
it
was
over
she
had
bought
the
pension
for
a
song
and
sold
it
for
great
riches
she
had
developed
from
a
nobody
into
the
desired
of
syndicates
and
after
long
long
monotonous
strenuous
years
of
possession
the
day
had
come
the
emotional
moment
had
come
when
she
had
yielded
up
the
keys
of
ownership
to
mardon
and
a
man
from
the
hotel
moscow
and
had
paid
her
servants
for
the
last
time
and
signed
the
last
receipted
bill
the
men
had
been
very
gallant
and
had
requested
her
to
stay
in
the
pension
as
their
guest
until
she
was
ready
to
leave
paris
but
she
had
declined
that
she
could
not
have
borne
to
remain
in
the
pension
under
the
reign
of
another
she
had
left
at
once
and
gone
to
a
hotel
with
her
few
goods
while
finally
disposing
of
certain
financial
questions
and
one
evening
jacqueline
had
come
to
see
her
and
had
wept
her
exit
from
the
pension
frensham
struck
her
now
as
poignantly
pathetic
in
its
quickness
and
its
absence
of
ceremonial
ten
steps
and
her
career
was
finished
closed
astonishing
with
what
liquid
tenderness
she
turned
and
looked
back
on
that
hard
fighting
exhausting
life
in
paris
for
even
if
she
had
unconsciously
liked
it
she
had
never
enjoyed
it
she
had
always
compared
france
disadvantageously
with
england
always
resented
the
french
temperament
in
business
always
been
convinced
that
never
knew
where
you
with
french
tradespeople
and
now
they
flitted
before
her
endowed
with
a
wondrous
charm
so
polite
in
their
lying
so
eager
to
spare
your
feelings
and
to
reassure
you
so
neat
and
prim
and
the
french
shops
so
exquisitely
arranged
even
a
butcher
shop
in
paris
was
a
pleasure
to
the
eye
whereas
the
butcher
shop
in
wedgwood
street
which
she
remembered
of
old
and
which
she
had
glimpsed
from
the
cab
what
a
bloody
shambles
she
longed
for
paris
again
she
longed
to
stretch
her
lungs
in
paris
these
people
in
bursley
did
not
suspect
what
paris
was
they
did
not
appreciate
and
they
never
would
appreciate
the
marvels
that
she
had
accomplished
in
a
theatre
of
marvels
they
probably
never
realized
that
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
the
world
was
not
more
or
less
like
bursley
they
had
no
curiosity
even
constance
was
a
thousand
times
more
interested
in
relating
trifles
of
bursley
gossip
than
in
listening
to
details
of
life
in
paris
occasionally
she
had
expressed
a
mild
vapid
surprise
at
things
told
to
her
by
sophia
but
she
was
not
really
impressed
because
her
curiosity
did
not
extend
beyond
bursley
she
like
the
rest
had
the
formidable
egotism
of
the
provinces
and
if
sophia
had
informed
her
that
the
heads
of
parisians
grew
out
of
their
navels
she
would
have
murmured
well
well
bless
us
i
never
heard
of
such
things
brindley
second
boy
has
got
his
head
quite
crooked
poor
little
fellow
why
should
sophia
feel
sorrowful
she
did
not
know
she
was
free
free
to
go
where
she
liked
and
do
what
she
liked
she
had
no
responsibilities
no
cares
the
thought
of
her
husband
had
long
ago
ceased
to
rouse
in
her
any
feeling
of
any
kind
she
was
rich
critchlow
had
accumulated
for
her
about
as
much
money
as
she
had
herself
acquired
never
could
she
spend
her
income
she
did
not
know
how
to
spend
it
she
lacked
nothing
that
was
procurable
she
had
no
desires
except
the
direct
desire
for
happiness
if
thirty
thousand
pounds
or
so
could
have
bought
a
son
like
cyril
she
would
have
bought
one
for
herself
she
bitterly
regretted
that
she
had
no
child
in
this
she
envied
constance
a
child
seemed
to
be
the
one
commodity
worth
having
she
was
too
free
too
exempt
from
responsibilities
in
spite
of
constance
she
was
alone
in
the
world
the
strangeness
of
the
hazards
of
life
overwhelmed
her
here
she
was
at
fifty
alone
but
the
idea
of
leaving
constance
having
once
rejoined
her
did
not
please
sophia
it
disquieted
her
she
could
not
see
herself
living
away
from
constance
she
was
alone
but
constance
was
there
she
was
downstairs
first
and
she
had
a
little
conversation
with
amy
and
she
stood
on
the
step
of
the
while
fossette
made
a
preliminary
inspection
of
spot
gutter
she
found
the
air
nipping
constance
when
she
descended
saw
stretching
across
one
side
of
the
an
umbrella
sophia
present
to
her
from
paris
it
was
an
umbrella
such
that
a
better
could
not
be
bought
it
would
have
impressed
even
aunt
harriet
the
handle
was
of
gold
set
with
a
circlet
of
opalines
the
tips
of
the
ribs
were
also
of
gold
it
was
this
detail
which
staggered
constance
frankly
this
development
of
luxury
had
been
unknown
and
unsuspected
in
the
square
that
the
tips
of
the
ribs
should
match
the
handle
that
did
truly
beat
everything
sophia
said
calmly
that
the
device
was
quite
common
but
she
did
not
conceal
that
the
umbrella
was
strictly
of
the
highest
class
and
that
it
might
be
shown
to
queens
without
shame
she
intimated
that
the
frame
a
paragon
handle
and
tips
would
outlast
many
silks
constance
was
childish
with
pleasure
they
decided
to
go
out
marketing
together
the
unspoken
thought
in
their
minds
was
that
as
sophia
would
have
to
be
introduced
to
the
town
sooner
or
later
it
might
as
well
be
sooner
constance
looked
at
the
sky
it
ca
possibly
rain
she
said
i
shall
take
my
umbrella
chapter
iii
towards
hotel
life
i
sophia
wore
list
slippers
in
the
morning
it
was
a
habit
which
she
had
formed
in
the
rue
lord
byron
by
accident
rather
than
with
an
intention
to
utilize
list
slippers
for
the
effective
supervision
of
servants
these
list
slippers
were
the
immediate
cause
of
important
happenings
in
luke
square
sophia
had
been
with
constance
one
calendar
month
it
was
of
course
astonishing
how
quickly
the
time
had
passed
and
she
had
become
familiar
with
the
house
restraint
had
gradually
ceased
to
mark
the
relations
of
the
sisters
constance
in
particular
hid
nothing
from
sophia
who
was
made
aware
of
the
minor
and
major
defects
of
amy
and
all
the
other
creakings
of
the
household
machine
meals
were
eaten
off
the
ordinary
tablecloths
and
on
the
days
for
out
the
parlour
constance
assumed
with
a
little
laugh
that
sophia
would
excuse
amy
apron
which
she
had
not
had
time
to
change
in
brief
sophia
was
no
longer
a
stranger
and
nobody
felt
bound
to
pretend
that
things
were
not
exactly
what
they
were
in
spite
of
the
foulness
and
the
provinciality
of
bursley
sophia
enjoyed
the
intimacy
with
constance
as
for
constance
she
was
enchanted
the
inflections
of
their
voices
when
they
were
talking
to
each
other
very
privately
were
often
tender
and
these
sudden
surprising
tendernesses
secretly
thrilled
both
of
them
on
the
fourth
sunday
morning
sophia
put
on
her
and
those
list
slippers
very
early
and
paid
a
visit
to
constance
bedroom
she
was
somewhat
concerned
about
constance
and
her
concern
was
pleasurable
to
her
she
made
the
most
of
it
amy
with
her
lifelong
carelessness
about
doors
had
criminally
failed
to
latch
the
of
the
parlour
on
the
previous
morning
and
constance
had
only
perceived
the
omission
by
the
phenomenon
of
frigidity
in
her
legs
at
breakfast
she
always
sat
with
her
back
to
the
door
in
her
mother
fluted
and
sophia
on
the
spot
but
not
in
the
chair
occupied
by
john
baines
in
the
forties
and
in
the
seventies
and
later
by
samuel
povey
constance
had
been
alarmed
by
that
frigidity
i
shall
have
a
return
of
my
sciatica
she
had
exclaimed
and
sophia
was
startled
by
the
apprehension
in
her
tone
before
evening
the
sciatica
had
indeed
revisited
constance
sciatic
nerve
and
sophia
for
the
first
time
gained
an
idea
of
what
a
pulsating
sciatica
can
do
in
the
way
of
torturing
its
victim
constance
in
addition
to
the
sciatica
had
caught
a
sneezing
cold
and
the
act
of
sneezing
caused
her
the
most
acute
pain
sophia
had
soon
stopped
the
sneezing
constance
was
got
to
bed
sophia
wished
to
summon
the
doctor
but
constance
assured
her
that
the
doctor
would
have
nothing
new
to
advise
constance
suffered
angelically
the
weak
and
exquisite
sweetness
of
her
smile
as
she
lay
in
bed
under
the
stress
of
twinging
pain
amid
bottles
was
amazing
to
sophia
it
made
her
think
upon
the
reserves
of
character
and
upon
the
variety
of
the
manifestations
of
the
blood
so
on
the
sunday
morning
she
had
arisen
early
just
after
amy
she
discovered
constance
to
be
a
little
better
as
regards
the
neuralgia
but
exhausted
by
the
torments
of
a
sleepless
night
sophia
though
she
had
herself
not
slept
well
felt
somehow
for
having
slept
at
all
you
poor
dear
she
murmured
brimming
with
sympathy
i
shall
make
you
some
tea
at
once
myself
oh
amy
will
do
it
said
constance
sophia
repeated
with
a
resolute
intonation
i
shall
make
it
myself
and
after
being
satisfied
that
there
was
no
instant
need
for
a
renewal
of
bottles
she
went
further
downstairs
in
those
list
slippers
as
she
was
descending
the
dark
kitchen
steps
she
heard
amy
voice
in
pettish
exclamation
oh
get
out
you
followed
by
a
yelp
from
fossette
she
had
a
swift
movement
of
anger
which
she
controlled
the
relations
between
her
and
fossette
were
not
marked
by
transports
and
her
rule
over
dogs
in
general
was
severe
even
when
alone
she
very
seldom
kissed
the
animal
passionately
according
to
the
general
habit
of
people
owning
dogs
but
she
loved
fossette
and
moreover
her
love
for
fossette
had
been
lately
sharpened
by
the
ridicule
which
bursley
had
showered
upon
that
strange
beast
happily
for
sophia
amour
propre
there
was
no
means
of
getting
fossette
shaved
in
bursley
and
thus
fossette
was
daily
growing
less
comic
to
the
bursley
eye
sophia
could
therefore
without
loss
of
dignity
yield
to
force
of
circumstances
what
she
would
not
have
yielded
to
popular
opinion
she
guessed
that
amy
had
no
liking
for
the
dog
but
the
accent
which
amy
had
put
upon
the
seemed
to
indicate
that
amy
was
making
distinctions
between
fossette
and
spot
and
this
disturbed
sophia
much
more
than
yelp
sophia
coughed
and
entered
the
kitchen
spot
was
lapping
his
morning
milk
out
of
a
saucer
while
fossette
stood
wistfully
an
amorphous
mass
of
thick
hair
under
the
table
good
morning
amy
said
sophia
with
dreadful
politeness
good
morning
m
said
amy
glumly
amy
knew
that
sophia
had
heard
that
yelp
and
sophia
knew
that
she
knew
the
pretence
of
politeness
was
horrible
both
the
women
felt
as
though
the
kitchen
was
sanded
with
gunpowder
and
there
were
lighted
matches
about
sophia
had
a
very
proper
grievance
against
amy
on
account
of
the
open
door
of
the
previous
day
sophia
thought
that
after
such
a
sin
the
least
amy
could
do
was
to
show
contrition
and
amiability
and
an
anxiety
to
please
which
things
amy
had
not
shown
amy
had
a
grievance
against
sophia
because
sophia
had
recently
thrust
upon
her
a
fresh
method
of
cooking
green
vegetables
amy
was
a
strong
opponent
of
new
or
foreign
methods
sophia
was
not
aware
of
this
grievance
for
amy
had
hidden
it
under
her
customary
cringing
politeness
to
sophia
they
surveyed
each
other
like
opposing
armies
what
a
pity
you
have
no
here
i
want
to
make
some
tea
at
once
for
povey
said
sophia
inspecting
the
fire
m
said
amy
hostilely
it
was
sophia
list
slippers
which
had
finally
decided
amy
to
drop
the
mask
of
deference
she
made
no
effort
to
aid
sophia
she
gave
no
indication
as
to
where
the
various
necessaries
for
tea
were
to
be
found
sophia
got
the
kettle
and
washed
it
out
sophia
got
the
smallest
and
as
the
had
been
left
in
it
she
washed
out
the
teapot
also
with
exaggerated
noise
and
meticulousness
sophia
got
the
sugar
and
the
other
trifles
and
sophia
blew
up
the
fire
with
the
bellows
and
amy
did
nothing
in
particular
except
encourage
spot
to
drink
is
that
all
the
milk
you
give
to
fossette
sophia
demanded
coldly
when
it
had
come
to
fossette
turn
she
was
waiting
for
the
water
to
boil
the
saucer
for
the
bigger
dog
who
would
have
made
two
of
spot
was
not
half
full
it
all
there
is
to
spare
m
amy
rasped
sophia
made
no
reply
soon
afterwards
she
departed
with
the
tea
successfully
made
if
amy
had
not
been
a
mature
woman
of
over
forty
she
would
have
snorted
as
sophia
went
away
but
amy
was
scarcely
the
ordinary
silly
girl
save
for
a
certain
primness
as
she
offered
the
tray
to
her
sister
sophia
demeanour
gave
no
sign
whatever
that
the
amazon
in
her
was
aroused
constance
eager
trembling
pleasure
in
the
tea
touched
her
deeply
and
she
was
exceedingly
thankful
that
constance
had
her
sophia
as
a
succour
in
time
of
distress
a
few
minutes
later
constance
having
first
asked
sophia
what
time
it
was
by
the
watch
in
the
on
the
chest
of
drawers
the
swiss
clock
had
long
since
ceased
to
work
pulled
the
red
tassel
of
the
over
her
bed
a
bell
tinkled
far
away
in
the
kitchen
anything
i
can
do
sophia
inquired
oh
no
thanks
said
constance
i
only
want
my
letters
if
the
postman
has
come
he
ought
to
have
been
here
long
ago
sophia
had
learned
during
her
stay
that
sunday
morning
was
the
morning
on
which
constance
expected
a
letter
from
cyril
it
was
a
definite
arrangement
between
mother
and
son
that
cyril
should
write
on
saturdays
and
constance
on
sundays
sophia
knew
that
constance
set
store
by
this
letter
becoming
more
and
more
preoccupied
about
cyril
as
the
end
of
the
week
approached
since
sophia
arrival
cyril
letter
had
not
failed
to
come
but
once
it
had
been
naught
save
a
scribbled
line
or
two
and
sophia
gathered
that
it
was
never
a
certainty
and
that
constance
was
accustomed
though
not
reconciled
to
disappointments
sophia
had
been
allowed
to
read
the
letters
they
left
a
faint
impression
on
her
mind
that
her
favourite
was
perhaps
somewhat
negligent
in
his
relations
with
his
mother
there
was
no
reply
to
the
bell
constance
rang
again
without
effect
with
a
brusque
movement
sophia
left
the
bedroom
by
way
of
cyril
room
amy
she
called
over
the
banisters
do
you
not
hear
your
bell
i
coming
as
quick
as
i
can
m
the
voice
was
still
very
glum
sophia
murmured
something
inarticulate
staying
till
assured
that
amy
really
was
coming
and
then
she
passed
back
into
cyril
bedroom
she
waited
there
hesitant
not
exactly
on
the
watch
not
exactly
unwilling
to
assist
at
an
interview
between
amy
and
amy
mistress
indeed
she
could
not
have
surely
analyzed
her
motive
for
remaining
in
bedroom
with
the
door
ajar
between
that
room
and
constance
amy
reluctantly
mounted
the
stairs
and
went
into
her
mistress
bedroom
with
her
chin
in
the
air
she
thought
that
sophia
had
gone
up
to
the
second
storey
where
she
she
stood
in
silence
by
the
bed
showing
no
sympathy
with
constance
no
curiosity
as
to
the
indisposition
she
objected
to
constance
attack
of
sciatica
as
being
a
too
permanent
reproof
of
her
carelessness
as
to
doors
constance
also
waited
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
as
if
expectant
well
amy
she
said
at
length
in
her
voice
weakened
by
fatigue
and
pain
the
letters
there
ai
no
letters
said
amy
grimly
you
might
have
known
if
there
been
any
i
should
have
brought
up
postman
went
past
twenty
minutes
agone
i
always
being
interrupted
and
it
is
as
if
i
had
got
enough
to
do
now
she
turned
to
leave
and
was
pulling
the
door
open
amy
said
a
voice
sharply
it
was
sophia
the
servant
jumped
and
in
spite
of
herself
obeyed
the
implicit
imperious
command
to
stop
you
will
please
not
speak
to
your
mistress
in
that
tone
at
any
rate
while
i
here
said
sophia
icily
you
know
she
is
ill
and
weak
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
i
never
amy
began
i
do
want
to
argue
sophia
said
angrily
please
leave
the
room
amy
obeyed
she
was
cowed
in
addition
to
being
staggered
to
the
persons
involved
in
it
this
episode
was
intensely
dramatic
sophia
had
surmised
that
constance
permitted
liberties
of
speech
to
amy
she
had
even
guessed
that
amy
sometimes
took
licence
to
be
rude
but
that
the
relations
between
them
were
such
as
to
allow
the
bullying
of
constance
by
an
amy
downright
insolent
this
had
shocked
and
wounded
sophia
who
suddenly
had
a
vision
of
constance
as
the
victim
of
a
reign
of
terror
if
the
creature
will
do
this
while
i
here
said
sophia
to
herself
what
does
she
do
when
they
are
alone
together
in
the
house
well
she
exclaimed
i
never
heard
of
such
and
you
let
her
talk
to
you
in
that
style
my
dear
constance
constance
was
sitting
up
in
bed
the
small
on
her
knees
her
eyes
were
moist
the
tears
had
filled
them
when
she
knew
that
there
was
no
letter
ordinarily
the
failure
of
cyril
letter
would
not
have
made
her
cry
but
weakness
had
impaired
her
and
the
tears
having
once
got
into
her
eyes
she
could
not
dismiss
them
there
they
were
she
been
with
me
such
a
long
time
constance
murmured
she
takes
liberties
i
corrected
her
once
or
twice
liberties
sophia
repeated
the
word
liberties
of
course
i
really
ought
not
to
allow
it
said
constance
i
ought
to
have
put
a
stop
to
it
long
since
well
said
sophia
rather
relieved
by
this
symptom
of
secret
mind
i
do
hope
you
wo
think
i
meddlesome
but
truly
it
was
too
much
for
me
the
words
were
out
of
my
mouth
before
i
she
stopped
you
were
quite
right
quite
right
said
constance
seeing
before
her
in
the
woman
of
fifty
the
passionate
girl
of
fifteen
i
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
of
servants
said
sophia
i
know
you
have
constance
put
in
and
i
convinced
that
it
never
pays
to
stand
any
sauce
servants
do
understand
kindness
and
forbearance
and
this
sort
of
thing
grows
and
grows
till
you
ca
call
your
soul
your
own
you
are
quite
right
constance
said
again
with
even
more
positiveness
not
merely
the
conviction
that
sophia
was
quite
right
but
the
desire
to
assure
sophia
that
sophia
was
not
meddlesome
gave
force
to
her
utterance
amy
allusion
to
extra
work
shamed
amy
mistress
as
a
hostess
and
she
was
bound
to
make
amends
now
as
to
that
woman
said
sophia
in
a
lower
voice
as
she
sat
down
confidentially
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
she
told
constance
about
amy
and
the
dogs
and
about
amy
rudeness
in
the
kitchen
i
should
never
have
dreamt
of
mentioning
such
things
she
finished
but
under
the
circumstances
i
feel
it
right
that
you
should
know
i
feel
you
ought
to
know
and
constance
nodded
her
head
in
thorough
agreement
she
did
not
trouble
to
go
into
articulate
apologies
to
her
guest
for
the
actual
misdeeds
of
her
servant
the
sisters
were
now
on
a
plane
of
intimacy
where
such
apologies
would
have
been
supererogatory
their
voices
fell
lower
and
lower
and
the
case
of
amy
was
laid
bare
and
discussed
to
the
minutest
detail
gradually
they
realized
that
what
had
occurred
was
a
crisis
they
were
both
very
excited
apprehensive
and
rather
too
consciously
defiant
at
the
same
time
they
were
drawn
very
close
to
each
other
by
generous
indignation
and
by
constance
absolute
loyalty
a
long
time
passed
before
constance
said
thinking
about
something
else
i
expect
it
been
delayed
in
the
post
cyril
letter
oh
no
doubt
if
you
knew
the
posts
in
france
my
word
then
they
determined
with
little
sighs
to
face
the
crisis
cheerfully
in
truth
it
was
a
crisis
and
a
great
one
the
sensation
of
the
crisis
affected
the
atmosphere
of
the
entire
house
constance
got
up
for
tea
and
managed
to
walk
to
the
and
when
sophia
after
an
absence
in
her
own
room
came
down
to
tea
and
found
the
tea
all
served
constance
whispered
she
given
notice
and
sunday
too
what
did
she
say
she
did
say
much
constance
replied
vaguely
hiding
from
sophia
that
amy
had
harped
on
the
too
great
profusion
of
mistresses
in
that
house
after
all
it
just
as
well
she
be
all
right
she
saved
a
good
bit
of
money
and
she
has
friends
but
how
foolish
of
her
to
give
up
such
a
good
place
she
simply
does
care
said
constance
who
was
a
little
hurt
by
amy
defection
when
she
takes
a
thing
into
her
head
she
simply
does
care
she
got
no
common
sense
i
always
known
that
so
you
going
to
leave
amy
said
sophia
that
evening
as
amy
was
passing
through
the
parlour
on
her
way
to
bed
constance
was
already
arranged
for
the
night
i
am
m
answered
amy
precisely
her
tone
was
not
rude
but
it
was
firm
she
had
apparently
reconnoitred
her
position
in
calmness
i
sorry
i
was
obliged
to
correct
you
this
morning
said
sophia
with
cheerful
amicableness
pleased
in
spite
of
herself
with
the
woman
tone
but
i
think
you
will
see
that
i
had
reason
to
i
been
thinking
it
over
m
said
amy
with
dignity
and
i
see
as
i
must
leave
there
was
a
pause
well
you
know
best
good
night
amy
good
night
m
she
a
decent
woman
thought
sophia
but
hopeless
for
this
place
now
the
sisters
were
fronted
with
the
fact
that
constance
had
a
month
in
which
to
find
a
new
servant
and
that
a
new
servant
would
have
to
be
trained
in
and
might
easily
prove
disastrous
both
constance
and
amy
were
profoundly
disturbed
by
the
prospective
dissolution
of
a
bond
which
dated
from
the
seventies
and
both
were
decided
that
there
was
no
alternative
to
the
dissolution
outsiders
knew
merely
that
povey
old
servant
was
leaving
outsiders
merely
saw
advertisement
in
the
signal
for
a
new
servant
they
could
not
read
hearts
some
of
the
younger
generation
even
said
superiorly
that
women
like
povey
seemed
to
have
servants
on
the
brain
etc
ii
well
have
you
got
your
letter
sophia
demanded
cheerfully
of
constance
when
she
entered
the
bedroom
the
next
morning
constance
merely
shook
her
head
she
was
very
depressed
cheerfulness
died
out
as
she
hated
to
be
insincerely
optimistic
she
said
nothing
otherwise
she
might
have
remarked
perhaps
the
afternoon
post
will
bring
it
gloom
reigned
to
constance
particularly
as
amy
had
given
notice
and
as
cyril
was
it
seemed
really
that
the
time
was
out
of
joint
and
life
unworth
living
even
the
presence
of
sophia
did
not
bring
her
much
comfort
immediately
sophia
left
the
room
constance
sciatica
began
to
return
and
in
a
severe
form
she
had
regretted
this
less
for
the
pain
than
because
she
had
just
assured
sophia
quite
honestly
that
she
was
not
suffering
sophia
had
been
sceptical
after
that
it
was
of
course
imperative
that
constance
should
get
up
as
usual
she
had
said
that
she
would
get
up
as
usual
besides
there
was
the
immense
enterprise
of
obtaining
a
new
servant
worries
loomed
mountainous
suppose
cyril
were
dangerously
ill
and
unable
to
write
suppose
something
had
happened
to
him
supposing
she
never
did
obtain
a
new
servant
sophia
up
in
her
room
was
endeavouring
to
be
philosophical
and
to
see
the
world
brightly
she
was
saying
to
herself
that
she
must
take
constance
in
hand
that
what
constance
lacked
was
energy
that
constance
must
be
stirred
out
of
her
groove
and
in
the
cavernous
kitchen
amy
preparing
the
breakfast
was
meditating
upon
the
ingratitude
of
employers
and
wondering
what
the
future
held
for
her
she
had
a
widowed
mother
in
the
picturesque
village
of
sneyd
where
the
mortal
and
immortal
welfare
of
every
inhabitant
was
watched
over
by
god
vicegerent
the
busy
countess
of
chell
she
possessed
about
two
hundred
pounds
of
her
own
her
mother
for
years
had
been
begging
amy
to
share
her
home
free
of
expense
but
nevertheless
mind
was
black
with
foreboding
and
vague
dejection
the
house
was
a
house
of
sorrow
and
these
three
women
each
solitary
the
devotees
of
sorrow
and
the
two
dogs
wandered
disconsolate
up
and
down
aware
of
the
necessity
for
circumspection
never
guessing
that
the
highly
peculiar
state
of
the
atmosphere
had
been
brought
about
by
nothing
but
a
door
and
an
incorrect
tone
as
sophia
fully
dressed
this
time
was
descending
to
breakfast
she
heard
constance
voice
feebly
calling
her
and
found
the
convalescent
still
in
bed
the
truth
could
not
be
concealed
constance
was
once
more
in
great
pain
and
her
moral
condition
was
not
favourable
to
fortitude
i
wish
you
had
told
me
to
begin
with
sophia
could
not
help
saying
then
i
should
have
known
what
to
do
constance
did
not
defend
herself
by
saying
that
the
pain
had
only
recurred
since
their
first
interview
that
morning
she
just
wept
i
very
low
she
blubbered
sophia
was
surprised
she
felt
that
this
was
not
a
baines
during
the
progress
of
that
interminable
april
morning
her
acquaintance
with
the
possibilities
of
sciatica
as
an
agent
destructive
of
moral
fibre
was
further
increased
constance
had
no
force
at
all
to
resist
its
activity
the
sweetness
of
her
resignation
seemed
to
melt
into
nullity
she
held
to
it
that
the
doctor
could
do
nothing
for
her
about
noon
when
sophia
was
moving
anxiously
around
her
she
suddenly
screamed
i
feel
as
if
my
leg
was
going
to
burst
she
cried
that
decided
sophia
as
soon
as
constance
was
a
little
easier
she
went
downstairs
to
amy
amy
she
said
it
a
doctor
stirling
that
your
mistress
has
when
she
ill
is
it
yes
m
where
is
his
surgery
well
m
he
did
live
just
opposite
with
harrop
but
latterly
he
gone
to
live
at
bleakridge
i
wish
you
would
put
your
things
on
and
run
up
there
and
ask
him
to
call
as
soon
as
he
can
i
will
m
said
amy
with
the
greatest
willingness
i
thought
i
heard
missis
cry
out
she
was
not
effusive
she
was
better
than
effusive
kindly
and
helpful
with
a
certain
reserve
there
something
about
that
woman
i
like
said
sophia
to
herself
for
a
proved
fool
amy
was
indeed
holding
her
own
rather
well
stirling
drove
down
about
two
he
had
now
been
established
in
the
five
towns
for
more
than
a
decade
and
the
stamp
of
success
was
on
his
brow
and
on
the
proud
forehead
of
his
trotting
horse
he
had
in
the
phrase
of
the
signal
himself
with
the
local
life
of
the
district
he
was
liked
being
a
man
of
broad
sympathies
in
his
rich
scotch
accent
he
could
discuss
with
equal
ability
the
flavour
of
whisky
or
of
a
sermon
and
he
had
more
than
sufficient
tact
never
to
discuss
either
whiskies
or
sermons
in
the
wrong
place
he
had
made
a
speech
responding
for
the
learned
professions
at
the
annual
dinner
of
the
society
for
the
prosecution
of
felons
and
this
speech
in
which
praise
of
red
wine
was
rendered
innocuous
by
praise
of
books
his
fine
library
was
notorious
had
classed
him
as
a
wit
with
the
american
consul
whose
manner
was
modelled
on
mark
twain
he
was
years
of
age
tall
and
stoutish
with
a
chubby
boyish
face
that
the
razor
left
chiefly
blue
every
morning
the
immediate
effect
of
his
arrival
on
constance
was
miraculous
his
presence
almost
cured
her
for
a
moment
just
as
though
her
malady
had
been
toothache
and
he
a
dentist
then
when
he
had
finished
his
examination
the
pain
resumed
its
sway
over
her
in
talking
to
her
and
to
sophia
he
listened
very
seriously
to
all
that
they
said
he
seemed
to
regard
the
case
as
the
one
case
that
had
ever
aroused
his
genuine
professional
interest
but
as
it
unfolded
itself
in
all
its
difficulty
and
urgency
so
he
seemed
in
his
mind
to
be
discovering
wondrous
ways
of
dealing
with
it
these
mysterious
discoveries
seemed
to
give
him
confidence
and
his
confidence
was
communicated
to
the
patient
by
means
of
faint
sallies
of
humour
he
was
a
highly
skilled
doctor
this
fact
however
had
no
share
in
his
popularity
which
was
due
solely
to
his
rare
gift
of
taking
a
case
very
seriously
while
remaining
cheerful
he
said
he
would
return
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
he
returned
in
thirteen
minutes
with
a
hypodermic
syringe
with
which
he
attacked
the
pain
in
its
central
strongholds
what
is
it
asked
constance
breathing
gratitude
for
the
relief
he
paused
looking
at
her
roguishly
from
under
lowered
eyelids
i
better
not
tell
ye
he
said
it
might
lead
ye
into
mischief
oh
but
you
must
tell
me
doctor
constance
insisted
anxious
that
he
should
live
up
to
his
reputation
for
sophia
benefit
it
hydrochloride
of
cocaine
he
said
and
lifted
a
finger
beware
of
the
cocaine
habit
it
ruined
many
a
respectable
family
but
if
i
had
had
a
certain
amount
of
confidence
in
yer
strength
of
character
povey
i
would
have
risked
it
he
will
have
his
joke
will
the
doctor
constance
smiled
in
a
brighter
world
he
said
he
should
come
again
about
five
and
he
arrived
about
six
and
injected
more
cocaine
the
special
importance
of
the
case
was
thereby
established
on
this
second
visit
he
and
sophia
soon
grew
rather
friendly
when
she
conducted
him
downstairs
again
he
stopped
chatting
with
her
in
the
parlour
for
a
long
time
as
though
he
had
nothing
else
on
earth
to
do
while
his
coachman
walked
the
horse
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
door
his
attitude
to
her
flattered
sophia
for
it
showed
that
he
took
her
for
no
ordinary
woman
it
implied
a
continual
assumption
that
she
must
be
a
mine
of
interest
for
any
one
who
was
privileged
to
delve
into
her
memory
so
far
among
constance
acquaintance
sophia
had
met
no
one
who
showed
more
than
a
perfunctory
curiosity
as
to
her
life
her
return
was
accepted
with
indifference
her
escapade
of
thirty
years
ago
had
entirely
lost
its
dramatic
quality
many
people
indeed
had
never
heard
that
she
had
run
away
from
home
to
marry
a
commercial
traveller
and
to
those
who
remembered
or
had
been
told
it
seemed
a
sufficiently
banal
exploit
after
thirty
years
her
fear
and
constance
that
the
town
would
be
murmurous
with
gossip
was
ludicrously
unfounded
the
effect
of
time
was
such
that
even
critchlow
appeared
to
have
forgotten
even
that
she
had
been
indirectly
responsible
for
her
father
death
she
had
nearly
forgotten
it
herself
when
she
happened
to
think
of
it
she
felt
no
shame
no
remorse
seeing
the
death
as
purely
accidental
and
not
altogether
unfortunate
on
two
points
only
was
the
town
inquisitive
as
to
her
husband
and
as
to
the
precise
figure
at
which
she
had
sold
the
pension
the
town
knew
that
she
was
probably
not
a
widow
for
she
had
been
obliged
to
tell
critchlow
and
critchlow
in
some
hour
of
tenderness
had
told
maria
but
nobody
had
dared
to
mention
the
name
of
gerald
scales
to
her
with
her
fashionable
clothes
her
striking
mien
of
command
and
the
legend
of
her
wealth
she
inspired
respect
if
not
awe
in
the
townsfolk
in
the
attitude
there
was
something
of
amaze
she
felt
it
though
the
dull
apathy
of
the
people
she
had
hitherto
met
was
assuredly
not
without
its
advantageous
side
for
her
tranquillity
of
mind
it
had
touched
her
vanity
and
the
gaze
of
the
doctor
soothed
the
smart
he
had
so
obviously
divined
her
interestingness
he
so
obviously
wanted
to
enjoy
it
i
just
been
reading
zola
he
said
her
mind
searched
backwards
and
recalled
a
poster
oh
she
replied
debacle
yes
what
do
ye
think
of
it
his
eyes
lighted
at
the
prospect
of
a
talk
he
was
even
pleased
to
hear
her
give
him
the
title
in
french
i
have
read
it
she
said
and
she
was
momentarily
sorry
that
she
had
not
read
it
for
she
could
see
that
he
was
dashed
the
doctor
had
supposed
that
residence
in
a
foreign
country
involved
a
knowledge
of
the
literature
of
that
country
yet
he
had
never
supposed
that
residence
in
england
involved
a
knowledge
of
english
literature
sophia
had
read
practically
nothing
since
for
her
the
latest
author
was
cherbuliez
moreover
her
impression
of
zola
was
that
he
was
not
at
all
nice
and
that
he
was
the
enemy
of
his
race
though
at
that
date
the
world
had
scarcely
heard
of
dreyfus
stirling
had
too
hastily
assumed
that
the
opinions
of
the
bourgeois
upon
art
differ
in
different
countries
and
ye
actually
were
in
the
siege
of
paris
he
questioned
trying
again
yes
and
the
commune
yes
the
commune
too
well
he
exclaimed
it
incredible
when
i
was
reading
the
the
night
before
last
i
said
to
myself
that
you
must
have
been
through
a
lot
of
all
that
i
did
know
i
was
going
to
have
the
pleasure
of
a
chat
with
ye
so
soon
she
smiled
but
how
did
you
know
i
was
in
the
siege
of
paris
she
asked
curious
how
do
i
know
i
know
because
i
seen
that
birthday
card
ye
sent
to
povey
in
after
it
was
over
it
one
of
her
possessions
that
card
is
she
showed
it
me
one
day
when
she
told
me
ye
were
coming
sophia
started
she
had
quite
forgotten
that
card
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
constance
would
have
treasured
all
those
cards
that
she
had
despatched
during
the
early
years
of
her
exile
she
responded
as
well
as
she
could
to
his
eagerness
for
personal
details
concerning
the
siege
and
the
commune
he
might
have
been
disappointed
at
the
prose
of
her
answers
had
he
not
been
determined
not
to
be
disappointed
ye
seem
to
have
taken
it
all
very
quietly
he
observed
eh
yes
she
agreed
not
without
pride
but
it
a
long
time
since
those
events
as
they
existed
in
her
memory
scarcely
warranted
the
tremendous
fuss
subsequently
made
about
them
what
were
they
after
all
such
was
her
secret
thought
chirac
himself
was
now
nothing
but
a
faint
shadow
still
were
the
estimate
of
those
events
true
or
false
she
was
a
woman
who
had
been
through
them
and
stirling
high
appreciation
of
that
fact
was
very
pleasant
to
her
their
friendliness
approached
intimacy
night
had
fallen
outside
could
be
heard
the
champing
of
a
bit
i
must
be
getting
on
he
said
at
last
but
he
did
not
move
then
there
is
nothing
else
i
am
to
do
for
my
sister
sophia
inquired
i
do
think
so
said
he
it
is
a
question
of
medicine
then
what
is
it
a
question
of
sophia
demanded
bluntly
nerves
he
said
it
nearly
all
nerves
i
know
something
about
povey
constitution
now
and
i
was
hoping
that
your
visit
would
do
her
good
she
been
quite
well
i
mean
what
you
may
call
quite
well
until
the
day
before
yesterday
when
she
sat
in
that
draught
she
was
better
last
night
and
then
this
morning
i
find
her
ever
so
much
worse
no
worries
the
doctor
looked
at
her
confidentially
what
can
she
have
in
the
way
of
worries
exclaimed
sophia
that
to
say
real
worries
exactly
the
doctor
agreed
i
tell
her
she
does
know
what
worry
is
said
sophia
so
do
i
said
the
doctor
his
eyes
twinkling
she
was
a
little
upset
because
she
did
receive
her
usual
sunday
letter
from
cyril
yesterday
but
then
she
was
weak
and
low
clever
youth
cyril
mused
the
doctor
i
think
he
a
particularly
nice
boy
said
sophia
eagerly
so
you
seen
him
of
course
said
sophia
rather
stiffly
did
the
doctor
suppose
that
she
did
not
know
her
own
nephew
she
went
back
to
the
subject
of
her
sister
she
is
also
a
little
bothered
i
think
because
the
servant
is
going
to
leave
oh
so
amy
is
going
to
leave
is
she
he
spoke
still
lower
between
you
and
me
it
no
bad
thing
i
so
glad
you
think
so
in
another
few
years
the
servant
would
have
been
the
mistress
here
one
can
see
these
things
coming
on
but
it
so
difficult
to
do
anything
in
fact
ye
ca
do
anything
i
did
something
said
sophia
sharply
i
told
the
woman
straight
that
it
should
go
on
while
i
was
in
the
house
i
did
suspect
it
at
first
but
when
i
found
it
out
i
can
tell
you
she
let
the
doctor
imagine
what
she
could
tell
him
he
smiled
no
he
said
i
can
easily
understand
that
ye
suspect
anything
at
first
when
she
well
and
bright
povey
could
hold
her
own
so
i
told
but
it
was
certainly
slowly
getting
worse
then
people
talk
about
it
said
sophia
shocked
as
a
native
of
bursley
scales
said
the
doctor
ye
ought
to
know
what
people
in
bursley
do
sophia
put
her
lips
together
the
doctor
rose
smoothing
his
waistcoat
what
does
she
bother
with
servants
at
all
for
he
burst
out
she
perfectly
free
she
got
a
care
in
the
world
if
she
only
knew
it
why
does
she
go
out
and
about
and
enjoy
herself
she
wants
stirring
up
that
what
your
sister
wants
you
quite
right
sophia
burst
out
in
her
turn
that
precisely
what
i
say
to
myself
precisely
i
was
thinking
it
over
only
this
morning
she
wants
stirring
up
she
got
into
a
rut
she
needs
to
be
jolly
why
does
she
go
to
some
seaside
place
and
live
in
a
hotel
and
enjoy
herself
is
there
anything
to
prevent
her
nothing
whatever
instead
of
being
dependent
on
a
servant
i
believe
in
enjoying
self
when
ye
got
the
money
to
do
it
with
can
ye
imagine
anybody
living
in
bursley
for
pleasure
and
especially
in
luke
square
right
in
the
thick
of
it
all
smoke
dirt
no
air
no
light
no
scenery
no
amusements
what
does
she
do
it
for
she
in
a
rut
yes
she
in
a
rut
sophia
repeated
her
own
phrase
which
he
had
copied
my
word
said
the
doctor
would
i
clear
out
and
enjoy
myself
if
i
could
your
sister
a
young
woman
of
course
she
is
sophia
concurred
feeling
that
she
herself
was
even
younger
of
course
she
is
and
except
that
she
nervously
organized
and
has
certain
predispositions
there
nothing
the
matter
with
her
this
sciatica
i
do
say
it
would
be
cured
but
it
might
be
by
a
complete
change
and
throwing
off
all
these
ridiculous
worries
not
only
does
she
live
in
the
most
depressing
conditions
but
she
suffers
tortures
for
it
and
there
absolutely
no
need
for
her
to
be
here
at
all
doctor
said
sophia
solemnly
impressed
you
are
quite
right
i
agree
with
every
word
you
say
naturally
she
attached
to
the
place
he
continued
glancing
round
the
room
i
know
all
about
that
after
living
here
all
her
life
but
she
got
to
break
herself
of
her
attachment
it
her
duty
to
do
so
she
ought
to
show
a
little
energy
i
deeply
attached
to
my
bed
in
the
morning
but
i
have
to
leave
it
of
course
said
sophia
in
an
impatient
tone
as
though
disgusted
with
every
person
who
could
not
perceive
or
would
not
subscribe
to
these
obvious
truths
that
the
doctor
was
uttering
of
course
what
she
needs
is
the
bustle
of
life
in
a
good
hotel
a
good
hydro
for
instance
among
jolly
people
parties
games
excursions
she
would
be
the
same
woman
you
see
would
i
do
it
if
i
could
strathpeffer
she
soon
forget
her
sciatica
i
do
know
what
povey
annual
income
is
but
i
expect
that
if
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
live
in
the
dearest
hotel
in
england
there
would
be
no
reason
why
she
should
sophia
lifted
her
head
and
smiled
in
calm
amusement
i
expect
so
she
said
superiorly
a
hotel
that
the
life
no
worries
if
ye
want
anything
ye
ring
a
bell
if
a
waiter
gives
notice
it
some
one
else
who
has
the
worry
not
you
but
you
know
all
about
that
mrs
scales
no
one
better
murmured
sophia
good
evening
he
said
abruptly
sticking
out
his
hand
i
be
down
in
the
morning
did
you
ever
mention
this
to
my
sister
sophia
asked
him
rising
yes
said
he
but
it
no
use
oh
yes
i
told
her
but
she
does
really
think
it
quite
impossible
she
would
even
hear
of
going
to
live
in
london
with
her
beloved
son
she
wo
listen
i
never
thought
of
that
said
sophia
good
night
their
was
very
intimate
and
mutually
comprehending
he
was
pleased
by
the
quick
responsiveness
of
her
temperament
and
the
masterful
vigour
which
occasionally
flashed
out
in
her
replies
he
noticed
the
hardly
perceptible
distortion
of
her
handsome
worn
face
and
he
said
to
himself
she
been
through
a
thing
or
two
and
she
have
to
mind
her
p
and
q
sophia
was
pleased
because
he
admired
her
and
because
with
her
he
dropped
his
bedside
jocularities
and
talked
plainly
as
a
sensible
man
will
talk
when
he
meets
an
uncommonly
wise
woman
and
because
he
echoed
and
amplified
her
own
thoughts
she
honoured
him
by
standing
at
the
door
till
he
had
driven
off
for
a
few
moments
she
mused
solitary
in
the
parlour
and
then
lowering
the
gas
she
went
upstairs
to
her
sister
who
lay
in
the
dark
sophia
struck
a
match
you
been
having
quite
a
long
chat
with
the
doctor
said
constance
he
very
good
company
is
he
what
did
he
talk
about
this
time
he
wanted
to
know
about
paris
and
so
on
sophia
answered
oh
i
believe
he
a
rare
student
lying
there
in
the
dark
the
simple
constance
never
suspected
that
those
two
active
and
strenuous
ones
had
been
arranging
her
life
for
her
so
that
she
should
be
jolly
and
live
for
twenty
years
yet
she
did
not
suspect
that
she
had
been
tried
and
found
guilty
of
sinful
attachments
and
of
being
in
a
rut
and
of
lacking
the
elements
of
ordinary
sagacity
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
if
she
was
worried
and
ill
the
reason
was
to
be
found
in
her
own
blind
and
stupid
obstinacy
she
had
thought
herself
a
fairly
sensible
kind
of
creature
iii
the
sisters
had
an
early
supper
together
in
constance
bedroom
constance
was
much
easier
having
a
fancy
that
a
little
movement
would
be
beneficial
she
had
even
got
up
for
a
few
moments
and
moved
about
the
room
now
she
sat
ensconced
in
pillows
a
fire
burned
in
the
ineffectual
grate
from
the
sun
vaults
opposite
came
the
sound
of
a
phonograph
singing
an
invitation
to
god
to
save
its
gracious
queen
this
phonograph
was
a
wonderful
novelty
and
filled
the
sun
nightly
for
a
few
evenings
it
had
interested
the
sisters
in
spite
of
themselves
but
they
had
soon
sickened
of
it
and
loathed
it
sophia
became
more
and
more
obsessed
by
the
monstrous
absurdity
of
the
simple
fact
that
she
and
constance
were
there
in
that
dark
inconvenient
house
wearied
by
the
gaiety
of
blackened
by
smoke
surrounded
by
mud
instead
of
being
luxuriously
installed
in
a
beautiful
climate
amid
scenes
of
beauty
and
white
cleanliness
secretly
she
became
more
and
more
indignant
amy
entered
bearing
a
letter
in
her
coarse
hand
as
amy
unceremoniously
handed
the
letter
to
constance
sophia
thought
if
she
was
my
servant
she
would
hand
letters
on
a
tray
an
advertisement
had
already
been
sent
to
the
signal
constance
took
the
letter
trembling
here
it
is
at
last
she
cried
when
she
had
put
on
her
spectacles
and
read
it
she
exclaimed
bless
us
here
news
he
coming
down
that
why
he
did
write
on
saturday
as
usual
she
gave
the
letter
to
sophia
to
read
it
ran
sunday
midnight
dear
mother
just
a
line
to
say
i
am
coming
down
to
bursley
on
wednesday
on
business
with
peels
i
shall
get
to
knype
at
and
take
the
loop
i
been
very
busy
and
as
i
was
coming
down
i
did
write
on
saturday
i
hope
you
did
worry
love
to
yourself
and
aunt
sophia
yours
i
must
send
him
a
line
said
constance
excitedly
what
yes
amy
can
easily
catch
the
last
post
with
it
otherwise
he
know
that
i
got
his
letter
she
rang
the
bell
sophia
thought
his
coming
down
is
really
no
excuse
for
his
not
writing
on
saturday
how
could
she
guess
that
he
was
coming
down
i
shall
have
to
put
in
a
little
word
to
that
young
man
i
wonder
constance
is
so
blind
she
is
quite
satisfied
now
that
his
letter
has
come
on
behalf
of
the
elder
generation
she
rather
resented
constance
eagerness
to
write
in
answer
but
constance
was
not
so
blind
constance
thought
exactly
as
sophia
thought
in
her
heart
she
did
not
at
all
justify
or
excuse
cyril
she
remembered
separately
almost
every
instance
of
his
carelessness
in
her
regard
hope
i
did
worry
indeed
she
said
to
herself
with
a
faint
touch
of
bitterness
apropos
of
the
phrase
in
his
letter
nevertheless
she
insisted
on
writing
at
once
and
amy
had
to
bring
the
writing
materials
cyril
is
coming
down
on
wednesday
she
said
to
amy
with
great
dignity
amy
stony
calmness
was
shaken
for
cyril
was
a
great
deal
to
amy
amy
wondered
how
she
would
be
able
to
look
cyril
in
the
face
when
he
knew
that
she
had
given
notice
in
the
middle
of
writing
on
her
knee
constance
looked
up
at
sophia
and
said
as
though
defending
herself
against
an
accusation
i
write
to
him
yesterday
you
know
or
no
sophia
murmured
assentingly
constance
rang
the
bell
yet
again
and
amy
was
sent
out
to
the
post
soon
afterwards
the
bell
was
rung
for
a
fourth
time
and
not
answered
i
suppose
she
has
come
back
yet
but
i
thought
i
heard
the
door
what
a
long
time
she
is
what
do
you
want
sophia
asked
i
just
want
to
speak
to
her
said
constance
when
the
bell
had
been
rung
seven
or
eight
times
amy
at
length
somewhat
breathless
amy
said
constance
let
me
examine
those
sheets
will
you
yes
said
amy
apparently
knowing
what
sheets
of
all
the
various
and
multitudinous
sheets
in
that
house
and
the
constance
added
as
amy
left
the
room
so
it
continued
the
next
day
the
fever
heightened
constance
was
up
early
before
sophia
and
trotting
about
the
house
like
a
girl
immediately
after
breakfast
cyril
bedroom
was
invested
and
revolutionized
not
till
evening
was
order
restored
in
that
chamber
and
on
the
wednesday
morning
it
had
to
be
dusted
afresh
sophia
watched
the
preparations
and
the
increasing
agitation
of
demeanour
with
an
astonishment
which
she
had
real
difficulty
in
concealing
is
the
woman
absolutely
mad
she
asked
herself
the
spectacle
was
ludicrous
or
it
seemed
so
to
sophia
whose
career
had
not
embraced
much
experience
of
mothers
it
was
not
as
if
the
manifestations
of
constance
anxiety
were
dignified
or
original
or
splendid
they
were
just
silly
ordinary
fussinesses
they
had
no
sense
in
them
sophia
was
very
careful
to
make
no
observation
she
felt
that
before
she
and
constance
were
very
much
older
she
had
a
very
great
deal
to
do
and
that
a
subtle
diplomacy
and
wary
tactics
would
be
necessary
moreover
constance
angelic
temper
was
slightly
affected
by
the
strain
of
expectation
she
had
a
tendency
to
rasp
after
the
was
set
she
suddenly
sprang
on
to
the
sofa
and
lifted
down
the
at
eve
engraving
the
dust
on
the
top
of
the
frame
incensed
her
what
are
you
going
to
do
sophia
asked
in
a
final
marvel
i
going
to
change
it
with
that
one
said
constance
pointing
to
another
engraving
opposite
the
fireplace
he
said
the
effect
would
be
very
much
better
if
they
were
changed
and
his
lordship
is
very
particular
constance
did
not
go
to
bursley
station
to
meet
her
son
she
explained
that
it
upset
her
to
do
so
and
that
also
cyril
preferred
her
not
to
come
suppose
i
go
to
meet
him
said
sophia
at
five
the
idea
had
visited
her
suddenly
she
thought
then
i
could
talk
to
him
before
any
one
else
oh
do
constance
agreed
sophia
put
her
things
on
with
remarkable
expedition
she
arrived
at
the
station
a
minute
before
the
train
came
in
only
a
few
persons
emerged
from
the
train
and
cyril
was
not
among
them
a
porter
said
that
there
was
not
supposed
to
be
any
connection
between
the
loop
line
trains
and
the
main
line
expresses
and
that
probably
the
express
had
missed
the
loop
she
waited
minutes
for
the
next
loop
and
cyril
did
not
emerge
from
that
train
either
constance
opened
the
to
her
and
showed
a
telegram
sorry
prevented
last
moment
writing
cyril
sophia
had
known
it
somehow
she
had
known
that
it
was
useless
to
wait
for
the
second
train
constance
was
silent
and
calm
sophia
also
what
a
shame
what
a
shame
thumped
sophia
heart
it
was
the
most
ordinary
episode
but
beneath
her
calm
she
was
furious
against
her
favourite
she
hesitated
i
just
going
out
a
minute
she
said
where
asked
constance
had
we
better
have
tea
i
suppose
we
must
have
tea
i
sha
be
long
i
want
to
buy
something
sophia
went
to
the
and
despatched
a
telegram
then
partially
eased
she
returned
to
the
arid
and
painful
desolation
of
the
house
iv
the
next
evening
cyril
sat
at
the
in
the
parlour
with
his
mother
and
his
aunt
to
constance
his
presence
there
had
something
of
the
miraculous
in
it
he
had
come
after
all
sophia
was
in
a
rich
robe
and
for
ornament
wore
an
old
which
was
clasped
at
the
throat
and
fell
in
double
to
her
waist
where
it
was
caught
in
her
belt
this
chain
interested
cyril
he
referred
to
it
once
or
twice
and
then
he
said
just
let
me
have
a
look
at
that
chain
and
put
out
his
hand
and
sophia
leaned
forward
so
that
he
could
handle
it
his
fingers
played
with
it
thus
for
some
seconds
the
picture
strikingly
affected
constance
at
length
he
dropped
it
and
said
h
after
a
pause
he
said
louis
sixteenth
eh
and
sophia
said
they
told
me
so
but
it
nothing
it
only
cost
thirty
francs
you
know
and
cyril
took
her
up
sharply
what
does
that
matter
then
after
another
pause
he
asked
how
often
do
you
break
a
link
of
it
oh
often
she
said
it
always
getting
shorter
and
he
murmured
mysteriously
h
he
was
still
mysterious
withdrawn
within
himself
extraordinarily
uninterested
in
his
physical
surroundings
but
that
evening
he
talked
more
than
he
usually
did
he
was
benevolent
and
showed
a
particular
benevolence
towards
his
mother
apparently
exerting
himself
to
answer
her
questions
with
fullness
and
heartiness
as
though
admitting
frankly
her
right
to
be
curious
he
praised
the
tea
he
seemed
to
notice
what
he
was
eating
he
took
spot
on
his
knee
and
gazed
in
admiration
at
fossette
by
jove
he
said
that
a
dog
that
is
all
the
same
and
he
burst
out
laughing
i
wo
have
fossette
laughed
at
sophia
warned
him
no
seriously
he
said
in
his
quality
of
an
amateur
of
dogs
she
is
very
fine
even
then
he
could
not
help
adding
what
you
can
see
of
her
whereupon
sophia
shook
her
head
deprecating
such
wit
sophia
was
very
lenient
towards
him
her
leniency
could
be
perceived
in
her
eyes
which
followed
his
movements
all
the
time
do
you
think
he
is
like
me
constance
she
asked
i
wish
i
was
half
as
said
cyril
quickly
and
constance
said
as
a
baby
he
was
very
like
you
he
was
a
handsome
baby
he
was
at
all
like
you
when
he
was
at
school
these
last
few
years
he
begun
to
be
like
you
again
he
very
much
changed
since
he
left
school
he
was
rather
heavy
and
clumsy
then
heavy
and
clumsy
exclaimed
sophia
well
i
should
never
have
believed
it
oh
but
he
was
constance
insisted
now
mater
said
cyril
it
a
pity
you
do
want
that
cake
cutting
into
i
think
i
could
have
eaten
a
bit
of
that
cake
but
of
course
if
it
only
for
show
constance
sprang
up
seizing
a
knife
you
should
tease
your
mother
sophia
told
him
he
does
really
want
any
constance
he
regularly
stuffed
himself
and
cyril
agreed
no
no
mater
do
cut
it
i
really
could
i
was
only
gassing
but
constance
could
never
clearly
see
through
humour
of
that
sort
she
cut
three
slices
of
cake
and
she
held
the
plate
towards
cyril
i
tell
you
i
really
could
he
protested
come
she
said
obstinately
i
waiting
how
much
longer
must
i
hold
this
plate
and
he
had
to
take
a
slice
so
had
sophia
when
she
was
roused
they
both
of
them
had
to
yield
to
constance
with
the
dogs
and
the
splendour
of
the
under
the
gas
and
the
distinction
of
sophia
and
cyril
and
the
conversation
which
on
the
whole
was
gay
and
free
rising
at
times
to
jolly
garrulity
the
scene
in
her
parlour
ought
surely
to
have
satisfied
constance
utterly
she
ought
to
have
been
quite
happy
as
her
sciatica
had
raised
the
siege
for
a
space
but
she
was
not
quite
happy
the
circumstances
of
arrival
had
disturbed
her
they
had
in
fact
wounded
her
though
she
would
scarcely
admit
the
wound
in
the
morning
she
had
received
a
brief
letter
from
cyril
to
say
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
come
and
vaguely
promising
or
to
run
down
at
a
later
date
that
letter
had
the
cardinal
defects
of
all
cyril
relations
with
his
mother
it
was
casual
and
it
was
not
candid
it
gave
no
hint
of
the
nature
of
the
obstacle
which
had
prevented
him
from
coming
cyril
had
always
been
too
secretive
she
was
gravely
depressed
by
the
letter
which
she
did
not
show
to
sophia
because
it
impaired
her
dignity
as
a
mother
and
displayed
her
son
in
a
bad
light
then
about
eleven
a
telegram
had
come
for
sophia
that
all
right
sophia
had
said
on
reading
it
he
be
here
this
evening
and
she
had
handed
over
the
telegram
which
read
very
well
will
come
same
train
and
constance
learned
that
when
sophia
had
rushed
out
just
before
tea
on
the
previous
evening
it
was
to
telegraph
to
cyril
what
did
you
say
to
him
constance
asked
oh
said
sophia
with
a
careless
air
i
told
him
i
thought
he
ought
to
come
after
all
you
more
important
than
any
business
constance
and
i
do
like
him
behaving
like
that
i
was
determined
he
should
come
sophia
had
tossed
her
proud
head
constance
had
pretended
to
be
pleased
and
grateful
but
the
existence
of
a
wound
was
incontestable
sophia
then
could
do
more
with
cyril
than
she
could
sophia
had
only
met
him
once
and
could
simply
twist
him
round
her
little
finger
he
would
never
have
done
so
much
for
his
mother
a
fine
sort
of
an
obstacle
it
must
have
been
if
a
single
telegram
from
sophia
could
overcome
it
and
sophia
too
was
secretive
she
had
gone
out
and
had
telegraphed
and
had
not
breathed
a
word
until
she
got
the
reply
sixteen
hours
later
she
was
secretive
and
cyril
was
secretive
they
resembled
one
another
they
had
taken
to
one
another
but
sophia
was
a
curious
mixture
when
constance
had
asked
her
if
she
should
go
to
the
station
again
to
meet
cyril
she
had
replied
scornfully
no
indeed
i
done
going
to
meet
cyril
people
who
do
arrive
must
not
expect
to
be
met
when
cyril
drove
up
to
the
door
sophia
had
been
in
attendance
she
hurried
down
the
steps
do
say
anything
about
my
telegram
she
had
rapidly
whispered
to
cyril
there
was
no
time
for
further
explanation
constance
was
at
the
top
of
the
steps
constance
had
not
heard
the
whisper
but
she
had
seen
it
and
she
saw
a
guilty
puzzled
look
on
cyril
face
afterwards
an
ineffectively
concealed
conspiratorial
look
on
both
their
faces
they
had
between
them
from
which
she
the
mother
was
shut
out
was
it
not
natural
that
she
should
be
wounded
she
was
far
too
proud
to
mention
the
telegrams
and
as
neither
cyril
nor
sophia
mentioned
them
the
circumstances
leading
to
change
of
plan
were
not
referred
to
at
all
which
was
very
curious
then
cyril
was
more
sociable
than
he
had
ever
been
he
was
different
under
his
aunt
gaze
certainly
he
treated
his
mother
faultlessly
but
constance
said
to
herself
it
is
because
she
is
here
that
he
is
so
specially
nice
to
me
when
tea
was
finished
and
they
were
going
upstairs
to
the
she
asked
him
with
her
eye
on
the
at
eve
engraving
well
is
it
a
success
what
his
eye
followed
hers
oh
you
changed
it
what
did
you
do
that
for
mater
you
said
it
would
be
better
like
that
she
reminded
him
did
i
he
seemed
genuinely
surprised
i
do
remember
i
believe
it
is
better
though
he
added
it
might
be
even
better
still
if
you
turned
it
the
other
way
up
he
pulled
a
face
to
sophia
and
screwed
up
his
shoulders
as
if
to
indicate
i
done
it
this
time
how
the
other
way
up
constance
queried
then
as
she
comprehended
that
he
was
teasing
her
she
said
get
away
with
you
and
pretended
to
box
his
ears
you
were
fond
enough
of
that
picture
at
one
time
she
said
ironically
yes
i
was
mater
he
submissively
agreed
there
no
getting
over
that
and
he
pressed
her
cheeks
between
his
hands
and
kissed
her
in
the
he
smoked
cigarettes
and
played
the
piano
waltzes
of
his
own
composition
constance
and
sophia
did
not
entirely
comprehend
those
waltzes
but
they
agreed
that
all
were
wonderful
and
that
one
was
very
pretty
indeed
it
soothed
constance
that
opinion
coincided
with
hers
he
said
that
that
waltz
was
the
worst
of
the
lot
when
he
had
finished
with
the
piano
constance
informed
him
about
amy
oh
she
told
me
he
said
when
she
brought
me
my
water
i
did
mention
it
because
i
thought
it
would
be
rather
a
sore
subject
beneath
the
casualness
of
his
tone
there
lurked
a
certain
curiosity
a
willingness
to
hear
details
he
heard
them
at
five
minutes
to
ten
when
constance
had
yawned
he
threw
a
bomb
among
them
on
the
hearthrug
well
he
said
i
got
an
appointment
with
matthew
at
the
conservative
club
at
ten
i
must
go
do
wait
up
for
me
both
women
protested
sophia
the
more
vivaciously
it
was
sophia
now
who
was
wounded
it
business
he
said
defending
himself
he
going
away
early
and
it
my
only
chance
and
as
constance
did
not
brighten
he
went
on
business
has
to
be
attended
to
you
must
think
i
got
nothing
to
do
but
enjoy
myself
no
hint
of
the
nature
of
the
business
he
never
explained
as
to
business
constance
knew
only
that
she
allowed
him
three
hundred
a
year
and
paid
his
local
tailor
the
sum
had
at
first
seemed
to
her
enormous
but
she
had
grown
accustomed
to
it
i
should
have
preferred
you
to
see
here
said
constance
you
could
have
had
a
room
to
yourselves
i
do
not
like
you
going
out
at
ten
at
night
to
a
club
well
good
night
mater
he
said
getting
up
see
you
i
shall
take
the
key
out
of
the
door
it
true
my
pocket
will
never
be
the
same
again
sophia
saw
constance
into
bed
and
provided
her
with
two
bottles
against
sciatica
they
did
not
talk
much
v
sophia
sat
waiting
on
the
sofa
in
the
parlour
it
appeared
to
her
that
though
little
more
than
a
month
had
elapsed
since
her
arrival
in
bursley
she
had
already
acquired
a
new
set
of
interests
and
anxieties
paris
and
her
life
there
had
receded
in
the
strangest
way
sometimes
for
hours
she
would
absolutely
forget
paris
thoughts
of
paris
were
disconcerting
for
either
paris
or
bursley
must
surely
be
unreal
as
she
sat
waiting
on
the
sofa
paris
kept
coming
into
her
mind
certainly
it
was
astonishing
that
she
should
be
just
as
preoccupied
with
her
schemes
for
the
welfare
of
constance
as
she
had
ever
been
preoccupied
with
schemes
for
the
improvement
of
the
pension
frensham
she
said
to
herself
my
life
has
been
so
queer
and
yet
every
part
of
it
separately
seemed
ordinary
enough
how
will
it
end
then
there
were
footfalls
on
the
steps
outside
and
a
key
was
put
into
the
door
which
she
at
once
opened
oh
exclaimed
cyril
startled
and
also
somewhat
out
of
countenance
you
still
up
thanks
he
came
in
smoking
the
end
of
a
cigar
fancy
having
to
cart
that
about
he
murmured
holding
up
the
great
key
before
inserting
it
in
the
lock
on
the
inside
i
stayed
up
said
sophia
because
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
your
mother
and
it
so
difficult
to
get
a
chance
cyril
smiled
not
without
and
dropped
into
his
mother
which
he
had
twisted
round
with
his
feet
to
face
the
sofa
yes
he
said
i
was
wondering
what
was
the
real
meaning
of
your
telegram
what
was
it
he
blew
out
a
lot
of
smoke
and
waited
for
her
reply
i
thought
you
ought
to
come
down
said
sophia
cheerfully
but
firmly
it
was
a
fearful
disappointment
to
your
mother
that
you
did
come
yesterday
and
when
she
expecting
a
letter
from
you
and
it
come
it
makes
her
oh
well
he
said
i
glad
it
no
worse
i
thought
from
your
telegram
there
was
something
seriously
wrong
and
then
when
you
told
me
not
to
mention
it
when
i
came
in
she
saw
that
he
failed
to
realize
the
situation
and
she
lifted
her
head
challengingly
you
neglect
your
mother
young
man
she
said
oh
come
now
auntie
he
answered
quite
gently
you
must
talk
like
that
i
write
to
her
every
week
i
never
missed
a
week
i
come
down
as
often
as
you
miss
the
sunday
sometimes
sophia
interrupted
him
perhaps
he
said
doubtfully
but
what
do
you
understand
that
she
simply
lives
for
your
letters
and
if
one
does
come
she
very
upset
indeed
ca
eat
and
it
brings
on
her
sciatica
and
i
do
know
what
he
was
taken
aback
by
her
boldness
her
directness
but
how
silly
of
her
a
fellow
ca
always
it
may
be
silly
but
there
it
is
you
ca
alter
her
and
after
all
what
would
it
cost
you
to
be
more
attentive
even
to
write
to
her
twice
a
week
you
are
going
to
tell
me
you
so
busy
as
all
that
i
know
a
great
deal
more
about
young
men
than
your
mother
does
she
smiled
like
an
aunt
he
answered
her
smile
sheepishly
if
you
only
put
yourself
in
your
mother
place
i
expect
you
quite
right
he
said
at
length
and
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
telling
me
how
was
i
to
know
he
threw
the
end
of
the
cigar
with
a
large
sweeping
gesture
into
the
fire
well
anyhow
you
know
now
she
said
curtly
and
she
thought
you
ought
to
have
known
it
was
your
business
to
know
but
she
was
pleased
with
the
way
in
which
he
had
accepted
her
criticism
and
the
gesture
with
which
he
threw
away
the
struck
her
as
very
distinguished
that
all
right
he
said
dreamily
as
if
to
say
that
done
with
and
he
rose
sophia
however
did
not
stir
your
mother
health
is
not
what
it
ought
to
be
she
went
on
and
gave
him
a
full
account
of
her
conversation
with
the
doctor
really
cyril
murmured
leaning
on
the
with
his
elbow
and
looking
down
at
her
stirling
said
that
did
he
i
should
have
thought
she
would
have
been
better
where
she
is
in
the
square
why
better
in
the
square
oh
i
do
know
neither
do
i
she
always
been
here
yes
said
sophia
she
been
here
a
great
deal
too
long
what
do
you
suggest
cyril
asked
with
impatience
in
his
voice
against
this
new
anxiety
that
was
being
thrust
upon
him
well
said
sophia
what
should
you
say
to
her
coming
to
london
and
living
with
you
cyril
started
back
sophia
could
see
that
he
was
genuinely
shocked
i
do
think
that
would
do
at
all
he
said
why
oh
i
do
think
it
would
london
would
suit
her
she
not
that
sort
of
woman
i
really
thought
she
was
quite
all
right
down
here
she
would
like
london
he
shook
his
head
looking
up
at
the
gas
his
eyes
had
a
dangerous
glare
but
supposing
she
said
she
did
look
here
cyril
began
in
a
new
and
brighter
tone
why
do
you
and
she
keep
house
together
somewhere
that
would
be
the
very
he
turned
his
head
sharply
there
was
a
noise
on
the
staircase
and
the
staircase
door
opened
with
its
eternal
creak
yes
said
sophia
the
champs
elysees
begins
at
the
place
de
la
concorde
and
ends
is
that
you
constance
the
figure
of
constance
filled
the
doorway
her
face
was
troubled
she
had
heard
cyril
in
the
street
and
had
come
down
to
see
why
he
remained
so
long
in
the
parlour
she
was
astounded
to
find
sophia
with
him
there
they
were
as
intimate
as
cronies
chattering
about
paris
undoubtedly
she
was
jealous
never
did
cyril
talk
like
that
to
her
i
thought
you
were
in
bed
and
asleep
sophia
she
said
weakly
nearly
one
no
said
sophia
i
did
seem
to
feel
like
going
to
bed
and
then
cyril
happened
to
come
in
but
neither
she
nor
cyril
could
look
innocent
and
constance
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
apprehensively
the
next
morning
cyril
received
a
letter
which
he
said
with
no
further
explanation
forced
him
to
leave
at
once
he
intimated
that
there
had
been
danger
in
his
coming
just
then
and
that
matters
had
turned
out
as
he
had
feared
you
think
over
what
i
said
he
whispered
to
sophia
when
they
were
alone
for
an
instant
and
let
me
know
vi
a
week
before
easter
the
guests
of
the
rutland
hotel
in
the
broad
walk
buxton
being
assembled
for
afternoon
tea
in
the
lounge
of
that
establishment
witnessed
the
arrival
of
two
ladies
and
two
dogs
critically
to
examine
newcomers
was
one
of
the
amusements
of
the
occupants
of
the
lounge
this
apartment
furnished
in
the
oriental
style
made
a
pretty
show
among
the
photographs
in
the
illustrated
brochure
of
the
hotel
and
though
draughty
it
was
of
all
the
public
rooms
the
favourite
it
was
draughty
because
only
separated
from
the
street
if
the
broad
walk
can
be
called
a
street
by
two
pairs
of
in
charge
of
two
every
visitor
entering
the
hotel
was
obliged
to
pass
through
the
lounge
and
for
newcomers
the
passage
was
an
ordeal
they
were
made
to
feel
that
they
had
so
much
to
learn
so
much
to
get
accustomed
to
like
passengers
who
join
a
ship
at
a
port
of
call
they
felt
that
the
business
lay
before
them
of
creating
a
niche
for
themselves
in
a
hostile
and
haughty
society
the
two
ladies
produced
a
fairly
favourable
impression
at
the
outset
by
reason
of
their
two
dogs
it
is
not
every
one
who
has
the
courage
to
bring
dogs
into
an
expensive
private
hotel
to
bring
one
dog
indicates
that
you
are
not
accustomed
to
deny
yourself
small
pleasures
for
the
sake
of
a
few
extra
shillings
to
bring
two
indicates
that
you
have
no
fear
of
and
that
you
are
in
the
habit
of
regarding
your
own
whim
as
nature
law
the
shorter
and
stouter
of
the
two
ladies
did
not
impose
herself
with
much
force
on
the
collective
vision
of
the
rutland
she
was
dressed
in
black
not
fashionably
though
with
a
certain
unpretending
richness
her
gestures
were
timid
and
nervous
evidently
she
relied
upon
her
tall
companion
to
shield
her
in
the
first
trying
contacts
of
hotel
life
the
tall
lady
was
of
a
different
stamp
handsome
stately
deliberate
and
handsomely
dressed
in
colours
she
had
the
assured
hard
gaze
of
a
person
who
is
thoroughly
habituated
to
the
inspection
of
strangers
she
curtly
asked
one
of
the
for
the
manager
and
the
manager
wife
tripped
rapidly
down
the
stairs
in
response
and
was
noticeably
deferential
her
voice
was
quiet
and
commanding
the
voice
of
one
who
gives
orders
that
are
obeyed
the
opinion
of
the
lounge
was
divided
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
sisters
they
vanished
quietly
upstairs
in
convoy
of
the
manager
wife
and
they
did
not
for
the
lounge
tea
which
in
any
case
would
have
been
undrinkably
stewed
it
then
became
known
by
the
agency
of
one
of
those
guests
to
be
found
in
every
hotel
who
acquire
all
the
secrets
of
the
hotel
by
the
exercise
of
unabashed
curiosity
on
the
personnel
that
the
two
ladies
had
engaged
two
bedrooms
nos
and
and
the
sumptuous
private
parlour
with
a
balcony
on
the
first
floor
styled
c
in
the
nomenclature
of
rooms
this
fact
definitely
established
the
position
of
the
new
arrivals
in
the
moral
fabric
of
the
hotel
they
were
wealthy
they
had
money
to
throw
away
for
even
in
a
select
hotel
like
the
rutland
it
is
not
everybody
who
indulges
in
a
private
there
were
only
four
such
apartments
in
the
hotel
as
against
fifty
bedrooms
at
dinner
they
had
a
small
table
to
themselves
in
a
corner
the
short
lady
wore
a
white
shawl
over
her
shoulders
her
almost
apologetic
manner
during
the
meal
confirmed
the
view
that
she
must
be
a
very
simple
person
unused
to
the
world
and
its
ways
the
other
continued
to
be
imperial
she
ordered
of
wine
and
drank
two
glasses
she
stared
about
her
quite
whereas
the
little
woman
divided
her
glances
between
her
companion
and
her
plate
they
did
not
talk
much
immediately
after
dinner
they
retired
widows
in
easy
circumstances
was
the
verdict
but
the
contrast
between
the
pair
held
puzzles
that
piqued
the
inquisitive
sophia
had
conquered
again
once
more
sophia
had
resolved
to
accomplish
a
thing
and
she
had
accomplished
it
events
had
fallen
out
thus
the
advertisement
for
a
general
servant
in
the
signal
had
been
a
disheartening
failure
a
few
answers
were
received
but
of
an
entirely
unsatisfactory
character
constance
a
great
deal
more
than
sophia
had
been
astounded
by
the
bearing
and
the
demands
of
modern
servants
constance
was
in
despair
if
constance
had
not
had
an
immense
pride
she
would
have
been
ready
to
suggest
to
sophia
that
amy
should
be
asked
to
on
but
constance
would
have
accepted
a
modern
impudent
wench
first
it
was
maria
critchlow
who
got
constance
out
of
her
difficulty
by
giving
her
particulars
of
a
reliable
servant
who
was
about
to
leave
a
situation
in
which
she
had
stayed
for
eight
years
constance
did
not
imagine
that
a
servant
recommended
by
maria
critchlow
would
suit
her
but
being
in
a
quandary
she
arranged
to
see
the
servant
and
both
she
and
sophia
were
very
pleased
with
the
girl
rose
bennion
by
name
the
mischief
was
that
rose
would
not
be
free
until
about
a
month
after
amy
had
left
rose
would
have
left
her
old
situation
but
she
had
a
fancy
to
go
and
spend
a
fortnight
with
a
married
sister
at
manchester
before
settling
into
new
quarters
constance
and
sophia
felt
that
this
caprice
of
rose
was
really
very
tiresome
and
unnecessary
of
course
amy
might
have
been
asked
to
on
just
for
a
month
amy
would
probably
have
volunteered
to
do
so
had
she
been
aware
of
the
circumstances
she
was
not
however
aware
of
the
circumstances
and
constance
was
determined
not
to
be
beholden
to
amy
for
anything
what
could
the
sisters
do
sophia
who
conducted
all
the
interviews
with
rose
and
other
candidates
said
that
it
would
be
a
grave
error
to
let
rose
slip
besides
they
had
no
one
to
take
her
place
no
one
who
could
come
at
once
the
dilemma
was
appalling
at
least
it
seemed
appalling
to
constance
who
really
believed
that
no
mistress
had
ever
been
so
fixed
and
yet
when
sophia
first
proposed
her
solution
constance
considered
it
to
be
a
quite
impossible
solution
sophia
idea
was
that
they
should
lock
up
the
house
and
leave
it
on
the
same
day
as
amy
left
it
to
spend
a
few
weeks
in
some
holiday
resort
to
begin
with
the
idea
of
leaving
the
house
empty
seemed
to
constance
a
mad
idea
the
house
had
never
been
left
empty
and
then
going
for
a
holiday
in
april
constance
had
never
been
for
a
holiday
except
in
the
month
of
august
no
the
project
was
beset
with
difficulties
and
dangers
which
could
not
be
overcome
nor
provided
against
for
example
we
ca
come
back
to
a
dirty
house
said
constance
and
we
ca
have
a
strange
servant
coming
here
before
us
to
which
sophia
had
replied
then
what
shall
you
do
and
constance
after
prodigious
reflection
on
the
frightful
pass
to
which
destiny
had
brought
her
had
said
that
she
supposed
she
would
have
to
manage
with
a
charwoman
until
rose
advent
she
asked
sophia
if
she
remembered
old
maggie
sophia
of
course
perfectly
remembered
old
maggie
was
dead
as
well
as
the
drunken
amiable
hollins
but
there
was
a
young
maggie
wife
of
a
bricklayer
who
went
out
charing
in
the
spare
time
left
from
looking
after
seven
children
the
more
constance
meditated
upon
young
maggie
the
more
was
she
convinced
that
young
maggie
would
meet
the
case
constance
felt
she
could
trust
young
maggie
this
expression
of
trust
in
maggie
was
constance
undoing
why
should
they
not
go
away
and
arrange
with
maggie
to
come
to
the
house
a
few
days
before
their
return
to
clean
and
ventilate
the
weight
of
reason
overbore
constance
she
yielded
unwillingly
but
she
yielded
it
was
the
mention
of
buxton
that
finally
moved
her
she
knew
buxton
her
old
landlady
at
buxton
was
dead
and
constance
had
not
visited
the
place
since
before
samuel
death
nevertheless
its
name
had
a
reassuring
sound
to
her
ears
and
for
sciatica
its
waters
and
climate
were
admitted
to
be
the
best
in
england
gradually
constance
permitted
herself
to
be
embarked
on
this
perilous
enterprise
of
shutting
up
the
house
for
days
she
imparted
the
information
to
amy
who
was
astounded
then
she
commenced
upon
her
domestic
preparations
she
wrapped
samuel
family
bible
in
brown
paper
she
put
copy
of
sir
edwin
landseer
away
in
a
drawer
and
she
took
ten
thousand
other
precautions
it
was
grotesque
it
was
farcical
it
was
what
you
please
and
when
with
the
cab
at
the
door
and
the
luggage
on
the
cab
and
the
dogs
chained
together
and
maria
critchlow
waiting
on
the
pavement
to
receive
the
key
constance
put
the
key
into
the
door
on
the
outside
and
locked
up
the
empty
house
constance
face
was
tragic
with
innumerable
apprehensions
and
sophia
felt
that
she
had
performed
a
miracle
she
had
on
the
whole
the
sisters
were
well
received
in
the
hotel
though
they
were
not
at
an
age
which
commands
popularity
in
the
criticism
which
was
passed
upon
them
the
free
realistic
and
relentless
criticism
of
private
hotels
sophia
was
at
first
set
down
as
overbearing
but
in
a
few
days
this
view
was
modified
and
sophia
rose
in
esteem
the
fact
was
that
sophia
behaviour
changed
after
hours
the
rutland
hotel
was
very
good
it
was
so
good
as
to
disturb
profound
beliefs
that
there
was
in
the
world
only
one
truly
pension
and
that
nobody
could
teach
the
creator
of
that
unique
pension
anything
about
the
art
of
management
the
food
was
excellent
the
attendance
in
the
bedrooms
was
excellent
and
sophia
knew
how
difficult
of
attainment
was
excellent
bedroom
attendance
and
to
the
eye
the
interior
of
the
rutland
presented
a
spectacle
far
richer
than
the
pension
frensham
could
show
the
standard
of
comfort
was
higher
the
guests
had
a
more
distinguished
appearance
it
is
true
that
the
prices
were
much
higher
sophia
was
humbled
she
had
enough
sense
to
adjust
her
perspective
further
she
found
herself
ignorant
of
many
matters
which
by
the
other
guests
were
taken
for
granted
and
used
as
a
basis
for
conversation
prolonged
residence
in
paris
would
not
justify
this
ignorance
it
seemed
rather
to
intensify
its
strangeness
thus
when
someone
of
cosmopolitan
experience
having
learnt
that
she
had
lived
in
paris
for
many
years
asked
what
had
been
going
on
lately
at
the
comedie
francaise
she
had
to
admit
that
she
had
not
been
in
a
french
theatre
for
nearly
thirty
years
and
when
on
a
sunday
the
same
person
questioned
her
about
the
english
chaplain
in
paris
lo
she
knew
nothing
but
his
name
had
never
even
seen
him
sophia
life
in
its
way
had
been
as
narrow
as
constance
though
her
experience
of
human
nature
was
wide
she
had
been
in
a
groove
as
deep
as
constance
she
had
been
utterly
absorbed
in
doing
one
single
thing
by
tacit
agreement
she
had
charge
of
the
expedition
she
paid
all
the
bills
constance
protested
against
the
expensiveness
of
the
affair
several
times
but
sophia
quietened
her
by
sheer
force
of
individuality
constance
had
one
advantage
over
sophia
she
knew
buxton
and
its
neighbourhood
intimately
and
she
was
therefore
in
a
position
to
show
off
the
sights
and
to
deal
with
local
peculiarities
in
all
other
respects
sophia
led
they
very
soon
became
acclimatized
to
the
hotel
they
moved
easily
between
turkey
carpets
and
sculptured
ceilings
their
eyes
grew
used
to
the
eternal
vision
of
themselves
and
other
dignities
in
gilt
mirrors
to
the
heaviness
of
great
of
picturesque
scenery
to
the
indications
of
surreptitious
dirt
behind
massive
furniture
to
the
of
the
of
the
waiters
to
the
litter
of
trays
boots
and
pails
in
long
corridors
their
ears
were
always
awake
to
the
sounds
of
gongs
and
bells
they
consulted
the
barometer
and
ordered
the
daily
carriage
with
the
perfunctoriness
of
habit
they
discovered
what
can
be
learnt
of
other
people
needlework
in
a
hotel
on
a
wet
day
they
performed
outings
with
they
invited
into
their
when
there
was
an
entertainment
they
did
not
avoid
it
sophia
was
determined
to
do
everything
that
could
with
propriety
be
done
partly
as
an
outlet
for
her
own
energy
which
since
she
left
paris
had
been
accumulating
but
more
on
constance
account
she
remembered
all
that
stirling
had
said
and
the
heartiness
of
her
own
agreement
with
his
opinions
it
was
a
great
day
when
under
tuition
of
an
aged
lady
and
in
the
privacy
of
their
parlour
they
both
began
to
study
the
elements
of
patience
neither
had
ever
played
at
cards
constance
was
almost
afraid
to
touch
cards
as
though
in
the
very
cardboard
there
had
been
something
unrighteous
and
perilous
but
the
respectability
of
a
luxurious
private
hotel
makes
proper
every
act
that
passes
within
its
walls
and
constance
plausibly
argued
that
no
harm
could
come
from
a
game
which
you
played
by
yourself
she
acquired
with
some
aptitude
several
varieties
of
patience
she
said
i
think
i
could
enjoy
that
if
i
kept
at
it
but
it
does
make
my
head
whirl
nevertheless
constance
was
not
happy
in
the
hotel
she
worried
the
whole
time
about
her
empty
house
she
anticipated
difficulties
and
even
disasters
she
wondered
again
and
again
whether
she
could
trust
the
second
maggie
in
her
house
alone
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
return
home
earlier
and
participate
personally
in
the
cleaning
she
would
have
decided
to
do
so
had
it
not
been
that
she
hesitated
to
subject
sophia
to
the
inconvenience
of
a
house
upside
down
the
matter
was
on
her
mind
always
always
she
was
restlessly
anticipating
the
day
when
they
would
leave
she
had
carelessly
left
her
heart
behind
in
luke
square
she
had
never
stayed
in
a
hotel
before
and
she
did
not
like
it
sciatica
occasionally
harassed
her
yet
when
it
came
to
the
point
she
would
not
drink
the
waters
she
said
she
never
had
drunk
them
and
seemed
to
regard
that
as
a
reason
why
she
never
should
sophia
had
achieved
a
miracle
in
getting
her
to
buxton
for
nearly
a
month
but
the
ultimate
grand
effect
lacked
brilliance
then
came
the
fatal
letter
the
desolating
letter
which
vindicated
constance
dark
apprehensions
rose
bennion
calmly
wrote
to
say
that
she
had
decided
not
to
come
to
luke
square
she
expressed
regret
for
any
inconvenience
which
might
possibly
be
caused
she
was
polite
but
the
monstrousness
of
it
constance
felt
that
this
actually
and
truly
was
the
deepest
depth
of
her
calamities
there
she
was
far
from
a
dirty
home
with
no
servant
and
no
prospect
of
a
servant
she
bore
herself
bravely
nobly
but
she
was
stricken
she
wanted
to
return
to
the
dirty
home
at
once
sophia
felt
that
the
situation
created
by
this
letter
would
demand
her
highest
powers
of
dealing
with
situations
and
she
determined
to
deal
with
it
adequately
great
measures
were
needed
for
constance
health
and
happiness
were
at
stake
she
alone
could
act
she
knew
that
she
could
not
rely
upon
cyril
she
still
had
an
immense
partiality
for
cyril
she
thought
him
the
most
charming
young
man
she
had
ever
known
she
knew
him
to
be
industrious
and
clever
but
in
his
relations
with
his
mother
there
was
a
hardness
a
touch
of
callousness
she
explained
it
vaguely
by
saying
that
did
not
get
on
well
together
which
was
strange
considering
constance
sweet
affectionateness
still
constance
could
be
a
little
trying
at
times
anyhow
it
was
soon
clear
to
sophia
that
the
idea
of
mother
and
son
living
together
in
london
was
entirely
impracticable
no
if
constance
was
to
be
saved
from
herself
there
was
no
one
but
sophia
to
save
her
after
half
a
morning
spent
chiefly
in
listening
to
constance
hopeless
comments
on
the
monstrous
letter
sophia
said
suddenly
that
she
must
take
the
dogs
for
an
airing
constance
did
not
feel
equal
to
walking
out
and
she
would
not
drive
she
did
not
want
sophia
to
because
the
sky
threatened
however
sophia
did
venture
and
she
returned
a
few
minutes
late
for
lunch
full
of
vigour
with
two
happy
dogs
constance
was
moodily
awaiting
her
in
the
constance
could
not
eat
but
sophia
ate
and
she
poured
out
cheerfulness
and
energy
as
from
a
source
inexhaustible
after
lunch
it
began
to
rain
constance
said
she
thought
she
should
retire
directly
to
the
i
coming
too
said
sophia
who
was
still
wearing
her
hat
and
coat
and
carried
her
gloves
in
her
hand
in
the
pretentious
and
banal
they
sat
down
on
either
side
the
fire
constance
put
a
little
shawl
round
her
shoulders
pushed
her
spectacles
into
her
grey
hair
folded
her
hands
and
sighed
an
enormous
sigh
oh
dear
she
was
the
tragic
muse
aged
and
in
black
silk
i
tell
you
what
i
been
thinking
said
sophia
folding
up
her
gloves
what
asked
constance
expecting
some
wonderful
solution
to
come
out
of
sophia
active
brain
there
no
earthly
reason
why
you
should
go
back
to
bursley
the
house
wo
run
away
and
it
costing
nothing
but
the
rent
why
not
take
things
easy
for
a
bit
and
stay
here
said
constance
with
an
inflection
that
enlightened
sophia
as
to
the
intensity
of
her
dislike
of
the
existence
at
the
rutland
no
not
here
sophia
answered
with
quick
deprecation
there
are
plenty
of
other
places
we
could
go
to
i
do
think
i
should
be
easy
in
my
mind
said
constance
what
with
nothing
being
settled
the
house
what
does
it
matter
about
the
house
it
matters
a
great
deal
said
constance
seriously
and
slightly
hurt
i
did
leave
things
as
if
we
were
going
to
be
away
for
a
long
time
it
would
do
i
do
see
that
anything
could
come
to
any
harm
i
really
do
said
sophia
persuasively
dirt
can
always
be
cleaned
after
all
i
think
you
ought
to
go
about
more
it
would
do
you
good
all
the
good
in
the
world
and
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
go
about
you
are
perfectly
free
why
should
we
go
abroad
together
for
instance
you
and
i
i
sure
you
would
enjoy
it
very
much
abroad
murmured
constance
aghast
recoiling
from
the
proposition
as
from
a
grave
danger
yes
said
sophia
brightly
and
eagerly
she
was
determined
to
take
constance
abroad
there
are
lots
of
places
we
could
go
to
and
live
very
comfortably
among
nice
english
people
she
thought
of
the
resorts
she
had
visited
with
gerald
in
the
sixties
they
seemed
to
her
like
cities
of
a
dream
they
came
back
to
her
as
a
dream
recurs
i
do
think
going
abroad
would
suit
me
said
constance
but
why
not
you
do
know
you
never
tried
my
dear
she
smiled
encouragingly
but
constance
did
not
smile
constance
was
inclined
to
be
grim
i
do
think
it
would
said
she
obstinately
i
one
of
your
i
not
like
you
we
ca
all
be
alike
she
added
with
her
accent
sophia
suppressed
a
feeling
of
irritation
she
knew
that
she
had
a
stronger
individuality
than
constance
well
then
she
said
with
undiminished
persuasiveness
in
england
or
scotland
there
are
several
places
i
should
like
to
visit
torquay
tunbridge
wells
i
always
that
tunbridge
wells
is
a
very
nice
town
indeed
with
very
superior
people
and
a
beautiful
climate
i
think
i
shall
have
to
be
getting
back
to
luke
square
said
constance
ignoring
all
that
sophia
had
said
there
so
much
to
be
done
then
sophia
looked
at
constance
with
a
more
serious
and
resolute
air
but
still
kindly
as
though
looking
thus
at
constance
for
own
good
you
are
making
a
mistake
constance
she
said
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
a
mistake
exclaimed
constance
startled
a
very
great
mistake
sophia
insisted
observing
that
she
was
creating
an
effect
i
do
see
how
i
can
be
making
a
mistake
constance
said
gaining
confidence
in
herself
as
she
thought
the
matter
over
no
said
sophia
i
sure
you
do
see
it
but
you
are
you
know
you
are
just
a
little
apt
to
let
yourself
be
a
slave
to
that
house
of
yours
instead
of
the
house
existing
for
you
you
exist
for
the
house
oh
sophia
constance
muttered
awkwardly
what
ideas
you
do
have
to
be
sure
in
her
nervousness
she
rose
and
picked
up
some
embroidery
adjusting
her
spectacles
and
coughing
when
she
sat
down
she
said
no
one
could
take
things
easier
than
i
do
as
regards
housekeeping
i
can
assure
you
i
let
dozens
of
little
matters
go
rather
than
bother
myself
then
why
do
you
bother
now
sophia
posed
her
i
ca
leave
the
place
like
that
constance
was
hurt
there
one
thing
i
ca
understand
said
sophia
raising
her
head
and
gazing
at
constance
again
and
that
is
why
you
live
in
square
at
all
i
must
live
somewhere
and
i
sure
it
very
pleasant
in
all
that
smoke
and
with
that
dirt
and
the
house
is
very
old
it
a
great
deal
better
built
than
a
lot
of
those
new
houses
by
the
park
constance
sharply
retorted
in
spite
of
herself
she
resented
any
criticism
of
her
house
she
even
resented
the
obvious
truth
that
it
was
old
you
never
get
a
servant
to
stay
in
that
for
one
thing
said
sophia
keeping
calm
oh
i
do
know
about
that
i
do
know
about
that
that
bennion
woman
did
object
to
it
anyway
it
all
very
well
for
you
sophia
to
talk
like
that
but
i
know
bursley
perhaps
better
than
you
do
she
was
tart
again
and
i
can
assure
you
that
my
house
is
looked
upon
as
a
very
good
house
indeed
oh
i
do
say
it
is
i
do
say
it
is
but
you
would
be
better
away
from
it
every
one
says
that
every
one
constance
looked
up
dropping
her
work
who
who
been
talking
about
me
well
said
sophia
the
doctor
for
instance
stirling
i
like
that
he
always
saying
that
bursley
is
one
of
the
healthiest
climates
in
england
he
always
sticking
up
for
bursley
stirling
thinks
you
ought
to
go
away
more
not
stay
always
in
that
dark
house
if
sophia
had
sufficiently
reflected
she
would
not
have
used
the
adjective
it
did
not
help
her
cause
oh
does
he
constance
fairly
snorted
well
if
it
of
any
interest
to
stirling
i
like
my
dark
house
has
he
ever
told
you
you
ought
to
go
away
more
sophia
persisted
he
may
have
mentioned
it
constance
reluctantly
admitted
when
he
was
talking
to
me
he
did
a
good
deal
more
than
mention
it
and
i
a
good
mind
to
tell
you
what
he
said
do
said
constance
politely
you
do
realize
how
serious
it
is
i
afraid
said
sophia
you
ca
see
yourself
she
hesitated
a
moment
her
blood
being
stirred
by
constance
peculiar
inflection
of
the
phrase
dark
house
her
judgment
was
slightly
obscured
she
decided
to
give
constance
a
fairly
full
version
of
the
conversation
between
herself
and
the
doctor
it
a
question
of
your
health
she
finished
i
think
it
my
duty
to
talk
to
you
seriously
and
i
have
done
i
hope
you
take
it
as
it
meant
oh
of
course
constance
hastened
to
say
and
she
thought
it
yet
three
months
that
we
been
together
and
she
trying
already
to
get
me
under
her
thumb
a
pause
ensued
sophia
at
length
said
there
no
doubt
that
both
your
sciatica
and
your
palpitations
are
due
to
nerves
and
you
let
your
nerves
get
into
a
state
because
you
worry
over
trifles
a
change
would
do
you
a
tremendous
amount
of
good
it
just
what
you
need
really
you
must
admit
constance
that
the
idea
of
living
always
in
a
place
like
luke
square
when
you
are
perfectly
free
to
do
what
you
like
and
go
where
you
like
you
must
admit
it
rather
too
much
constance
put
her
lips
together
and
bent
over
her
embroidery
now
what
do
you
say
sophia
gently
entreated
there
some
of
us
like
bursley
black
as
it
is
said
constance
and
sophia
was
surprised
to
detect
tears
in
her
sister
voice
now
my
dear
constance
she
remonstrated
it
no
use
cried
constance
flinging
away
her
work
and
letting
her
tears
flow
suddenly
her
face
was
distorted
she
was
behaving
just
like
a
child
it
no
use
i
got
to
go
back
home
and
look
after
things
it
no
use
here
we
are
pitching
money
about
in
this
place
perfectly
sinful
drives
carriages
extras
a
shilling
a
day
extra
for
each
dog
i
never
heard
of
such
and
i
sooner
be
at
home
that
it
i
sooner
be
at
home
this
was
the
first
reference
that
constance
had
made
for
a
long
time
to
the
question
of
expense
and
incomparably
the
most
violent
it
angered
sophia
we
will
count
it
that
you
are
here
as
my
guest
said
sophia
loftily
if
that
is
how
you
look
at
it
oh
no
said
constance
it
is
the
money
i
grudge
oh
no
we
wo
and
her
tears
were
falling
thick
yes
we
will
said
sophia
coldly
i
only
been
talking
to
you
for
your
own
good
i
well
constance
interrupted
her
despairingly
i
wish
you
try
to
domineer
over
me
domineer
exclaimed
sophia
aghast
well
constance
i
do
think
she
got
up
and
went
to
her
bedroom
where
the
dogs
were
imprisoned
they
escaped
to
the
stairs
she
was
shaking
with
emotion
this
was
what
came
of
trying
to
help
other
people
imagine
constance
truly
constance
was
most
unjust
and
quite
unlike
her
usual
self
and
sophia
encouraged
in
her
breast
the
feeling
of
injustice
suffered
but
a
voice
kept
saying
to
her
you
made
a
mess
of
this
you
not
conquered
this
time
you
beaten
and
the
situation
is
unworthy
of
you
of
both
of
you
two
women
of
fifty
quarreling
like
this
it
undignified
you
made
a
mess
of
things
and
to
strangle
the
voice
she
did
her
best
to
encourage
the
feeling
of
injustice
suffered
and
constance
was
absolutely
in
the
wrong
she
had
not
argued
at
all
she
had
merely
stuck
to
her
idea
like
a
mule
how
difficult
and
painful
would
be
the
next
meeting
with
constance
after
this
grievous
miscarriage
as
she
was
reflecting
thus
the
door
burst
open
and
constance
stumbled
as
it
were
blindly
into
the
bedroom
she
was
still
weeping
sophia
she
sobbed
supplicatingly
and
all
her
fat
body
was
trembling
you
must
kill
me
i
like
that
you
ca
alter
me
i
like
that
i
know
i
silly
but
it
no
use
she
made
a
piteous
figure
sophia
was
aware
of
a
lump
in
her
throat
it
all
right
constance
it
all
right
i
quite
understand
bother
any
more
constance
catching
her
breath
at
intervals
raised
her
wet
worn
face
and
kissed
her
sophia
remembered
the
very
words
ca
alter
her
which
she
had
used
in
remonstrating
with
cyril
and
now
she
had
been
guilty
of
precisely
the
same
unreason
as
that
with
which
she
had
reproached
cyril
she
was
ashamed
both
for
herself
and
for
constance
assuredly
it
had
not
been
such
a
scene
as
women
of
their
age
would
want
to
go
through
often
it
was
humiliating
she
wished
that
it
could
have
been
blotted
out
as
though
it
had
never
happened
neither
of
them
ever
forgot
it
they
had
had
a
lesson
and
particularly
sophia
had
had
a
lesson
having
learnt
they
left
the
rutland
amid
due
ceremonies
and
returned
to
luke
square
chapter
iv
end
of
sophia
i
the
kitchen
steps
were
as
steep
dark
and
difficult
as
ever
up
those
steps
sophia
scales
nine
years
older
than
when
she
had
failed
to
persuade
constance
to
leave
the
square
was
carrying
a
large
basket
weighted
with
all
the
heaviness
of
fossette
sophia
despite
her
age
climbed
the
steps
violently
and
burst
with
equal
violence
into
the
parlour
where
she
deposited
the
basket
on
the
floor
near
the
empty
fireplace
she
was
triumphant
and
breathless
she
looked
at
constance
who
had
been
standing
near
the
door
in
the
attitude
of
a
shocked
listener
there
said
sophia
did
you
hear
how
she
talked
yes
said
constance
what
shall
you
do
well
said
sophia
i
had
a
very
good
mind
to
order
her
out
of
the
house
at
once
but
then
i
thought
i
would
take
no
notice
her
time
will
be
up
in
three
weeks
it
best
to
be
indifferent
if
once
they
see
they
can
upset
you
however
i
was
going
to
leave
fossette
down
there
to
her
tender
mercies
a
moment
longer
she
simply
not
looked
after
her
at
all
sophia
went
on
her
knees
to
the
basket
and
pulling
aside
the
hair
round
about
the
head
examined
the
skin
fossette
was
a
sick
dog
and
behaved
like
one
fossette
too
was
nine
years
older
and
her
senility
was
offensive
she
was
to
no
sense
a
pleasant
object
see
here
said
sophia
constance
also
knelt
to
the
basket
and
here
said
sophia
and
here
the
dog
sighed
the
insincere
and
sigh
of
a
spoilt
animal
fossette
foolishly
hoped
by
such
appeals
to
be
spared
the
annoying
treatment
prescribed
for
her
by
the
veterinary
surgeon
while
the
sisters
were
coddling
her
and
protecting
her
from
her
own
paws
and
trying
to
persuade
her
that
all
was
for
the
best
another
aged
dog
wandered
vaguely
into
the
room
spot
spot
had
very
few
teeth
and
his
legs
were
stiff
he
had
only
one
vice
jealousy
fearing
that
fossette
might
be
receiving
the
entire
attention
of
his
mistresses
he
had
come
to
inquire
into
the
situation
when
he
found
the
justification
of
his
gloomiest
apprehensions
he
nosed
obstinately
up
to
constance
and
would
not
be
put
off
in
vain
constance
told
him
at
length
that
he
was
interfering
with
the
treatment
in
vain
sophia
ordered
him
sharply
to
go
away
he
would
not
listen
to
reason
being
furious
with
jealousy
he
got
his
foot
into
the
basket
will
you
exclaimed
sophia
angrily
and
gave
him
a
clout
on
his
old
head
he
barked
snappishly
and
retired
to
the
kitchen
again
disillusioned
tired
of
the
world
and
nursing
his
terrific
grievance
i
do
declare
said
sophia
that
dog
gets
worse
and
worse
constance
said
nothing
when
everything
was
done
that
could
be
done
for
the
aged
virgin
in
the
basket
the
sisters
rose
from
their
knees
stiffly
and
they
began
to
whisper
to
each
other
about
the
prospects
of
obtaining
a
fresh
servant
they
also
debated
whether
they
could
tolerate
the
criminal
eccentricities
of
the
present
occupant
of
the
cave
for
yet
another
three
weeks
evidently
they
were
in
the
midst
of
a
crisis
to
judge
from
constance
face
every
imaginable
woe
had
been
piled
on
them
by
destiny
without
the
slightest
regard
for
their
powers
of
resistance
her
eyes
had
the
permanent
look
of
worry
and
there
was
in
them
also
something
of
the
sophia
had
a
bellicose
air
as
though
the
creature
in
the
cave
had
squarely
challenged
her
and
she
was
decided
to
take
up
the
challenge
sophia
tone
seemed
to
imply
an
accusation
of
constance
the
general
tension
was
acute
then
suddenly
their
whispers
expired
and
the
door
opened
and
the
servant
came
in
to
lay
the
supper
her
nose
was
high
her
gaze
cruel
radiant
and
conquering
she
was
a
pretty
and
an
impudent
girl
of
about
she
knew
she
was
torturing
her
old
and
infirm
mistresses
she
did
not
care
she
did
it
purposely
her
motto
was
war
on
employers
get
all
you
can
out
of
them
for
they
will
get
all
they
can
out
of
you
on
principle
the
sole
principle
she
possessed
she
would
not
stay
in
a
place
more
than
six
months
she
liked
change
and
employers
did
not
like
change
she
was
shameless
with
men
she
ignored
all
orders
as
to
what
she
was
to
eat
and
what
she
was
not
to
eat
she
lived
up
to
the
full
resources
of
her
employers
she
could
be
to
the
last
degree
slatternly
or
she
could
be
as
neat
as
a
pin
with
an
apron
that
symbolized
purity
and
propriety
as
she
could
be
idle
during
a
whole
day
accumulating
dirty
dishes
from
morn
till
eve
on
the
other
hand
she
could
when
she
chose
work
with
astonishing
celerity
and
even
thoroughness
in
short
she
was
born
to
infuriate
a
mistress
like
sophia
and
to
wear
out
a
mistress
like
constance
her
strongest
advantage
in
the
struggle
was
that
she
enjoyed
altercation
she
revelled
in
a
brawl
she
found
peace
tedious
she
was
perfectly
calculated
to
convince
the
sisters
that
times
had
worsened
and
that
the
world
would
never
again
be
the
beautiful
agreeable
place
it
once
had
been
her
gestures
as
she
laid
the
table
were
very
graceful
in
the
pert
style
she
dropped
forks
into
their
appointed
positions
with
disdain
she
made
slightly
too
much
noise
when
she
turned
she
manoeuvred
her
swelling
hips
as
though
for
the
benefit
of
a
soldier
in
a
handsome
uniform
nothing
but
the
servant
had
been
changed
in
that
house
the
harmonium
on
which
povey
used
occasionally
to
play
was
still
behind
the
door
and
on
the
harmonium
was
the
of
which
baines
used
to
carry
the
key
on
her
bunch
in
the
corner
to
the
right
of
the
fireplace
still
hung
the
cupboard
where
baines
stored
her
pharmacopoeia
the
rest
of
the
furniture
was
arranged
as
it
had
been
arranged
when
the
death
of
baines
endowed
and
povey
with
all
the
treasures
of
the
house
at
axe
and
it
was
as
good
as
ever
better
than
ever
stirling
often
expressed
the
desire
for
a
corner
cupboard
like
baines
corner
cupboard
one
item
had
been
added
the
compote
which
matthew
had
noticed
in
the
of
the
pension
frensham
this
majestic
piece
which
had
been
reserved
by
sophia
in
the
sale
of
the
pension
stood
alone
on
a
canterbury
in
the
drawingroom
she
had
stored
it
with
a
few
other
trifles
in
paris
and
when
she
sent
for
it
and
the
arrived
both
she
and
constance
became
aware
that
they
were
united
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
of
worldly
goods
except
money
securities
and
clothes
that
compote
was
practically
all
that
sophia
owned
happily
it
was
a
item
doing
no
shame
to
the
antique
magnificence
of
the
in
yielding
to
constance
terrible
inertia
sophia
had
meant
nevertheless
to
work
her
own
will
on
the
interior
of
the
house
she
had
meant
to
bully
constance
into
modernizing
the
dwelling
she
did
bully
constance
but
the
house
defied
her
nothing
could
be
done
to
that
house
if
only
it
had
had
a
hall
or
lobby
a
complete
transformation
would
have
been
possible
but
there
was
no
access
to
the
upper
floor
except
through
the
parlour
the
parlour
could
not
therefore
be
turned
into
a
kitchen
and
the
basement
suppressed
and
the
ladies
of
the
house
could
not
live
entirely
on
the
upper
floor
the
disposition
of
the
rooms
had
to
remain
exactly
as
it
had
always
been
there
was
the
same
draught
under
the
door
the
same
darkness
on
the
kitchen
stairs
the
same
difficulties
with
tradesmen
in
the
distant
backyard
the
same
twist
in
the
bedroom
stairs
the
same
eternal
ascending
and
descending
of
pails
an
efficient
instead
of
the
large
and
capacious
range
alone
represented
the
twentieth
century
in
the
fixtures
of
the
house
buried
at
the
root
of
the
relations
between
the
sisters
was
grudge
against
constance
for
refusing
to
leave
the
square
sophia
was
loyal
she
would
not
consciously
give
with
one
hand
while
taking
away
with
the
other
and
in
accepting
constance
decision
she
honestly
meant
to
close
her
eyes
to
its
stupidity
but
she
could
not
entirely
succeed
she
could
not
avoid
thinking
that
the
angelic
constance
had
been
strangely
and
monstrously
selfish
in
refusing
to
quit
the
square
she
marvelled
that
a
woman
of
constance
sweet
and
calm
disposition
should
be
capable
of
so
vast
and
ruthless
an
egotism
constance
must
have
known
that
sophia
would
not
leave
her
and
that
the
habitation
of
the
square
was
a
continual
irk
to
sophia
constance
had
never
been
able
to
advance
a
single
argument
for
remaining
in
the
square
and
yet
she
would
not
budge
it
was
so
inconsistent
with
the
rest
of
behaviour
see
sophia
sitting
primly
there
by
the
table
a
woman
approaching
sixty
with
immense
experience
written
on
the
fine
hardness
of
her
worn
and
distinguished
face
though
her
hair
is
not
yet
all
grey
nor
her
figure
bowed
you
would
imagine
that
she
would
in
her
passage
through
the
world
have
learnt
better
than
to
expect
a
character
to
be
consistent
but
no
she
was
ever
disappointed
and
hurt
by
constance
inconsistency
and
see
constance
stout
and
bowed
looking
more
than
her
age
with
hair
nearly
white
and
slightly
trembling
hands
see
that
face
whose
mark
is
meekness
and
the
spirit
of
conciliation
the
desire
for
peace
you
would
not
think
that
that
placid
soul
could
while
submitting
to
it
inly
rage
against
the
imposed
weight
of
sophia
individuality
because
i
would
turn
out
of
my
house
to
please
her
constance
would
say
to
herself
she
fancies
she
is
entitled
to
do
just
as
she
likes
not
often
did
she
secretly
rebel
thus
but
it
occurred
sometimes
they
never
quarrelled
they
would
have
regarded
separation
as
a
disaster
considering
the
difference
of
their
lives
they
agreed
marvellously
in
their
judgment
of
things
but
that
buried
question
of
domicile
prevented
a
complete
unity
between
them
and
its
subtle
effect
was
to
influence
both
of
them
to
make
the
worst
instead
of
the
best
of
the
trifling
mishaps
that
disturbed
their
tranquillity
when
annoyed
sophia
would
meditate
upon
the
mere
fact
that
they
lived
in
the
square
for
no
reason
whatever
until
it
grew
incredibly
shocking
to
her
after
all
it
was
scarcely
conceivable
that
they
should
be
living
in
the
very
middle
of
a
dirty
ugly
industrial
town
simply
because
constance
mulishly
declined
to
move
another
thing
that
curiously
exasperated
both
of
them
upon
occasion
was
that
owing
to
a
recurrence
of
her
old
complaint
of
dizziness
after
meals
sophia
had
been
strictly
forbidden
to
drink
tea
which
she
loved
sophia
chafed
under
the
deprivation
and
pleasure
was
impaired
because
she
had
to
drink
it
alone
while
the
brazen
and
pretty
servant
mysteriously
smiling
to
herself
dropped
food
and
utensils
on
to
the
table
constance
and
sophia
attempted
to
converse
with
negligent
ease
upon
indifferent
topics
as
though
nothing
had
occurred
that
day
to
mar
the
beauty
of
ideal
relations
between
employers
and
employed
the
pretence
was
ludicrous
the
young
wench
saw
through
it
instantly
and
her
mysterious
smile
developed
almost
into
a
laugh
please
shut
the
door
after
you
maud
said
sophia
as
the
girl
picked
up
her
empty
tray
yes
replied
maud
politely
she
went
out
and
left
the
door
open
it
was
a
defiance
offered
from
sheer
youthful
wanton
mischief
the
sisters
looked
at
each
other
their
faces
gravely
troubled
aghast
as
though
they
had
glimpsed
the
end
of
civilized
society
as
though
they
felt
that
they
had
lived
too
long
into
an
age
of
decadence
and
open
shame
constance
face
showed
despair
she
might
have
been
about
to
be
pitched
into
the
gutter
without
a
friend
and
without
a
shilling
but
sophia
had
the
reckless
courage
that
disaster
breeds
sophia
jumped
up
and
stepped
to
the
door
maud
she
called
out
no
answer
maud
do
you
hear
me
the
suspense
was
fearful
still
no
answer
sophia
glanced
at
constance
either
she
shuts
this
door
or
she
leaves
this
house
at
once
even
if
i
have
to
fetch
a
policeman
and
sophia
disappeared
down
the
kitchen
steps
constance
trembled
with
painful
excitement
the
horror
of
existence
closed
in
upon
her
she
could
imagine
nothing
more
appalling
than
the
pass
to
which
they
had
been
brought
by
the
modern
change
in
the
lower
classes
in
the
kitchen
sophia
conscious
that
the
moment
held
the
future
of
at
least
the
next
three
weeks
collected
her
forces
maud
she
said
did
you
not
hear
me
call
you
maud
looked
up
from
a
book
doubtless
a
wicked
book
no
you
liar
thought
sophia
and
she
said
i
asked
you
to
shut
the
parlour
door
and
i
shall
be
obliged
if
you
will
do
so
now
maud
would
have
given
a
week
wages
for
the
moral
force
to
disobey
sophia
there
was
nothing
to
compel
her
to
obey
she
could
have
trampled
on
the
fragile
and
weak
sophia
but
something
in
sophia
gaze
compelled
her
to
obey
she
flounced
she
bridled
she
mumbled
she
unnecessarily
disturbed
the
venerable
spot
but
she
obeyed
sophia
had
risked
all
and
she
had
won
something
and
you
should
light
the
gas
in
the
kitchen
said
sophia
magnificently
as
maud
followed
her
up
the
steps
your
young
eyes
may
be
very
good
now
but
you
are
not
going
the
way
to
preserve
them
my
sister
and
i
have
often
told
you
that
we
do
not
grudge
you
gas
with
stateliness
she
rejoined
constance
and
sat
down
to
the
cold
supper
and
as
maud
clicked
the
door
to
the
sisters
breathed
relief
they
envisaged
new
tribulations
but
for
a
brief
instant
there
was
surcease
yet
they
could
not
eat
neither
of
them
when
it
came
to
the
point
could
swallow
the
day
had
been
too
exciting
too
distressing
they
were
at
the
end
of
their
resources
and
they
did
not
hide
from
each
other
that
they
were
at
the
end
of
their
resources
the
illness
of
fossette
without
anything
else
had
been
more
than
enough
to
ruin
their
tranquillity
but
the
illness
of
fossette
was
as
nothing
to
the
ingenious
naughtiness
of
the
servant
maud
had
a
sense
of
temporary
defeat
and
was
planning
fresh
operations
but
really
it
was
maud
who
had
conquered
poor
old
things
they
were
in
such
a
that
they
could
not
eat
i
not
going
to
let
her
think
she
can
spoil
my
appetite
said
sophia
dauntless
truly
that
woman
spirit
was
unquenchable
she
cut
a
couple
of
slices
off
the
cold
fowl
she
cut
a
tomato
into
slices
she
disturbed
the
butter
she
crumbled
bread
on
the
cloth
and
rubbed
bits
of
fowl
over
the
plates
and
dirtied
knives
and
forks
then
she
put
the
slices
of
fowl
and
bread
and
tomato
into
a
piece
of
tissue
paper
and
silently
went
upstairs
with
the
parcel
and
came
down
again
a
moment
afterwards
after
an
interval
she
rang
the
bell
and
lighted
the
gas
we
finished
maud
you
can
clear
away
constance
thirsted
for
a
cup
of
tea
she
felt
that
a
cup
of
tea
was
the
one
thing
that
would
certainly
keep
her
alive
she
longed
for
it
passionately
but
she
would
not
demand
it
from
maud
nor
would
she
mention
it
to
sophia
lest
sophia
flushed
by
the
victory
of
the
door
should
incur
new
risks
she
simply
did
without
on
empty
stomachs
they
tried
pathetically
to
help
each
other
in
games
of
patience
and
when
the
blithe
maud
passed
through
the
parlour
on
the
way
to
bed
she
saw
two
dignified
and
apparently
calm
ladies
apparently
absorbed
in
a
delightful
game
of
cards
apparently
without
a
worry
in
the
world
they
said
good
night
maud
cheerfully
politely
and
coldly
it
was
a
heroic
scene
immediately
afterwards
sophia
carried
fossette
up
to
her
own
bedroom
ii
the
next
afternoon
the
sisters
in
the
saw
speeding
down
the
square
the
doctor
partner
young
harrop
had
died
a
few
years
before
at
the
age
of
over
seventy
and
the
practice
was
much
larger
than
it
had
ever
been
even
in
the
time
of
old
harrop
instead
of
two
or
three
horses
stirling
kept
a
car
which
was
a
constant
spectacle
in
the
streets
of
the
district
i
do
hope
he
call
in
said
povey
and
sighed
sophia
smiled
to
herself
with
a
little
scorn
she
knew
that
desire
for
stirling
was
due
simply
to
the
need
which
she
felt
of
telling
some
one
about
the
great
calamity
that
had
happened
to
them
that
morning
constance
was
utterly
absorbed
by
it
in
the
most
provincial
way
sophia
had
said
to
herself
at
the
beginning
of
her
sojourn
in
bursley
and
long
afterwards
that
she
should
never
get
accustomed
to
the
exasperating
provinciality
of
the
town
exemplified
by
the
childish
preoccupation
of
the
inhabitants
with
their
own
affairs
no
characteristic
of
life
in
bursley
annoyed
her
more
than
this
none
had
oftener
caused
her
to
yearn
in
a
brief
madness
for
the
freedom
of
great
cities
but
she
had
got
accustomed
to
it
indeed
she
had
almost
ceased
to
notice
it
only
occasionally
when
her
nerves
were
more
upset
than
usual
did
it
strike
her
she
went
into
constance
bedroom
to
see
whether
the
doctor
car
halted
in
king
street
it
did
he
here
she
called
out
to
constance
i
wish
you
go
down
sophia
said
constance
i
ca
trust
that
minx
so
sophia
went
downstairs
to
superintend
the
opening
of
the
door
by
the
minx
the
doctor
was
radiant
according
to
custom
i
thought
i
just
see
how
that
dizziness
was
going
on
said
he
as
he
came
up
the
steps
i
glad
you
come
said
sophia
confidentially
since
the
first
days
of
their
acquaintanceship
they
had
always
been
confidential
you
do
my
sister
good
just
as
maud
was
closing
the
door
a
arrived
with
a
telegram
addressed
to
scales
sophia
read
it
and
then
crumpled
it
in
her
hand
what
wrong
with
povey
the
doctor
asked
when
the
servant
had
withdrawn
she
only
wants
a
bit
of
your
society
said
sophia
will
you
go
up
you
know
the
way
to
the
i
follow
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
staring
out
of
the
window
then
with
a
grunt
well
that
no
use
anyway
she
went
upstairs
after
the
doctor
already
constance
had
begun
upon
her
recital
yes
constance
was
saying
and
when
i
went
down
this
morning
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
breakfast
i
thought
spot
was
very
quiet
she
paused
he
was
dead
in
the
drawer
she
pretended
she
did
know
but
i
sure
she
did
nothing
will
convince
me
that
she
did
poison
that
dog
with
the
we
had
last
year
she
was
vexed
because
sophia
took
her
up
sharply
about
fossette
last
night
and
she
revenged
herself
on
the
other
dog
it
would
just
be
like
her
do
tell
me
i
know
i
should
have
packed
her
off
at
once
but
sophia
thought
better
not
we
prove
anything
as
sophia
says
now
what
do
you
think
of
it
doctor
constance
eyes
suddenly
filled
with
tears
ye
had
spot
a
long
time
had
ye
he
said
sympathetically
she
nodded
when
i
was
married
said
she
the
first
thing
my
husband
did
was
to
buy
a
and
ever
since
we
always
had
a
in
the
house
this
was
not
true
but
constance
was
firmly
convinced
of
its
truth
it
very
trying
said
the
doctor
i
know
when
my
airedale
died
i
said
to
my
wife
i
never
have
another
dog
unless
she
could
find
me
one
that
would
live
for
ever
ye
remember
my
airedale
oh
quite
well
well
my
wife
said
i
should
be
bound
to
have
another
one
sooner
or
later
and
the
sooner
the
better
she
went
straight
off
to
oldcastle
and
bought
me
a
spaniel
pup
and
there
was
such
a
training
it
that
we
had
too
much
time
to
think
about
piper
constance
regarded
this
procedure
as
somewhat
callous
and
she
said
so
tartly
then
she
recommenced
the
tale
of
spot
death
from
the
beginning
and
took
it
as
far
as
his
burial
that
afternoon
by
critchlow
manager
in
the
yard
it
had
been
necessary
to
remove
and
replace
of
course
said
stirling
ten
years
is
a
long
time
he
was
an
old
dog
well
you
still
got
the
celebrated
fossette
he
turned
to
sophia
oh
yes
said
constance
perfunctorily
fossette
ill
the
fact
is
that
if
fossette
had
been
ill
spot
would
probably
have
been
alive
and
well
now
her
tone
exhibited
a
grievance
she
could
not
forget
that
sophia
had
harshly
dismissed
spot
to
the
kitchen
thus
practically
sending
him
to
his
death
it
seemed
very
hard
to
her
that
fossette
whose
life
had
once
been
despaired
of
should
continue
to
exist
while
spot
always
healthy
and
unspoilt
should
die
untended
and
by
treachery
for
the
rest
she
had
never
liked
fossette
on
spot
behalf
she
had
always
been
jealous
of
fossette
probably
alive
and
well
now
she
repeated
with
a
peculiar
accent
observing
that
sophia
maintained
a
strange
silence
stirling
suspected
a
slight
tension
in
the
relations
of
the
sisters
and
he
changed
the
subject
one
of
his
great
qualities
was
that
he
refrained
from
changing
a
subject
introduced
by
a
patient
unless
there
was
a
professional
reason
for
changing
it
i
just
met
richard
povey
in
the
town
said
he
he
told
me
to
tell
ye
that
he
be
round
in
about
an
hour
or
so
to
take
you
for
a
spin
he
was
in
a
new
car
which
he
did
his
best
to
sell
to
me
but
he
succeed
it
very
kind
of
dick
said
constance
but
this
afternoon
really
we
not
i
thank
ye
to
take
it
as
a
prescription
then
replied
the
doctor
i
told
dick
i
see
that
ye
went
splendid
june
weather
no
dust
after
all
that
rain
it
do
ye
all
the
good
in
the
world
i
must
exercise
my
authority
the
truth
is
i
gradually
been
losing
all
control
over
ye
ye
do
just
as
ye
like
oh
doctor
how
you
do
run
on
murmured
constance
not
quite
well
pleased
by
his
tone
after
the
scene
between
sophia
and
herself
at
buxton
constance
had
always
to
a
certain
extent
in
the
doctor
own
phrase
her
knife
into
him
sophia
had
then
in
a
manner
betrayed
him
constance
and
the
doctor
discussed
that
matter
with
frankness
the
doctor
humorously
accusing
her
of
being
on
him
nevertheless
the
little
cloud
between
them
was
real
and
the
result
was
often
a
faint
captiousness
on
constance
part
in
judging
the
doctor
behaviour
he
got
a
surprise
for
ye
has
dick
the
doctor
added
dick
povey
after
his
father
death
and
his
own
partial
recovery
had
set
up
in
hanbridge
as
a
bicycle
agent
he
was
permanently
lamed
and
he
hopped
about
with
a
thick
stick
he
had
succeeded
with
bicycles
and
had
taken
to
automobiles
and
he
was
succeeding
with
automobiles
people
were
at
first
startled
that
he
should
advertise
himself
in
the
five
towns
there
was
an
obscure
general
feeling
that
because
his
mother
had
been
a
drunkard
and
his
father
a
murderer
dick
povey
had
no
right
to
exist
however
when
it
had
recovered
from
the
shock
of
seeing
dick
povey
announcement
of
bargains
in
the
signal
the
district
most
sensibly
decided
that
there
was
no
reason
why
dick
povey
should
not
sell
bicycles
as
well
as
a
man
with
normal
parents
he
was
now
supposed
to
be
acquiring
wealth
rapidly
it
was
said
that
he
was
a
marvellous
chauffeur
at
once
daring
and
prudent
he
had
one
day
several
years
previously
overtaken
the
sisters
in
the
rural
neighbourhood
of
sneyd
where
they
had
been
making
an
afternoon
excursion
constance
had
presented
him
to
sophia
and
he
had
insisted
on
driving
the
ladies
home
they
had
been
much
impressed
by
his
cautious
care
of
them
and
their
natural
prejudice
against
anything
so
new
as
a
motorcar
had
been
conquered
instantly
afterwards
he
had
taken
them
out
for
occasional
runs
he
had
a
great
admiration
for
constance
founded
on
gratitude
to
samuel
povey
and
as
for
sophia
he
always
said
to
her
that
she
would
be
an
ornament
to
any
car
you
have
heard
his
latest
i
suppose
said
the
doctor
smiling
what
is
it
sophia
asked
perfunctorily
he
wants
to
take
to
ballooning
it
seems
he
been
up
once
constance
made
a
deprecating
noise
with
her
lips
however
that
not
his
surprise
the
doctor
added
smiling
again
at
the
floor
he
was
sitting
on
the
and
saying
to
himself
behind
his
mask
of
effulgent
it
gets
more
and
more
uphill
work
cheering
up
these
two
women
i
try
them
on
federation
federation
was
the
name
given
to
the
scheme
for
blending
the
five
towns
into
one
town
which
would
be
the
twelfth
largest
town
in
the
kingdom
it
aroused
fury
in
bursley
which
saw
in
the
suggestion
nothing
but
the
extinction
of
its
ancient
glory
to
the
aggrandizement
of
hanbridge
hanbridge
had
already
with
the
assistance
of
electric
cars
that
whizzed
to
and
fro
every
five
minutes
robbed
bursley
of
of
its
retail
trade
as
witness
the
steady
decadence
of
the
square
and
bursley
had
no
mind
to
swallow
the
insult
and
become
a
mere
ward
of
hanbridge
bursley
would
die
fighting
both
constance
and
sophia
were
bitter
opponents
of
federation
they
would
have
been
capable
of
putting
federationists
to
the
torture
sophia
in
particular
though
so
long
absent
from
her
native
town
had
adopted
its
cause
with
characteristic
vigour
and
when
stirling
wished
to
practise
his
curative
treatment
of
taking
the
sisters
of
themselves
he
had
only
to
start
the
hare
of
federation
and
the
hunt
would
be
up
in
a
moment
but
this
afternoon
he
did
not
succeed
with
sophia
and
only
partially
with
constance
when
he
stated
that
there
was
to
be
a
public
meeting
that
very
night
and
that
constance
as
a
ratepayer
ought
to
go
to
it
and
vote
if
her
convictions
were
genuine
she
received
his
chaff
with
a
mere
murmur
to
the
effect
that
she
did
not
think
she
should
go
had
the
man
forgotten
that
spot
was
dead
at
length
he
became
grave
and
examined
them
both
as
to
their
ailments
and
nodded
his
head
and
looked
into
vacancy
while
meditating
upon
each
case
and
then
when
he
had
inquired
where
they
meant
to
go
for
their
summer
holidays
he
departed
are
you
going
to
see
him
out
constance
whispered
to
sophia
who
had
shaken
hands
with
him
at
the
drawingroom
door
it
was
sophia
who
did
the
running
about
owing
to
the
state
of
constance
sciatic
nerve
constance
had
indeed
become
extraordinarily
inert
leaving
everything
to
sophia
sophia
shook
her
head
she
hesitated
then
approached
constance
holding
out
her
hand
and
disclosing
the
crumpled
telegram
look
at
that
said
she
her
face
frightened
constance
who
was
always
expectant
of
new
anxieties
and
troubles
constance
straightened
out
the
paper
with
difficulty
and
read
gerald
scales
is
dangerously
ill
here
boldero
deansgate
manchester
all
through
the
inexpressibly
tedious
and
quite
unnecessary
call
of
stirling
why
had
he
chosen
to
call
just
then
neither
of
them
was
ill
sophia
had
held
that
telegram
concealed
in
her
hand
and
its
information
concealed
in
her
heart
she
had
kept
her
head
up
offering
a
calm
front
to
the
world
she
had
given
no
hint
of
the
terrible
explosion
for
an
explosion
it
was
constance
was
astounded
at
her
sister
which
entirely
passed
her
comprehension
constance
felt
that
worries
would
never
cease
but
would
rather
go
on
multiplying
until
death
ended
all
first
there
had
been
the
frightful
worry
of
the
servant
then
the
extremely
distressing
death
and
burial
of
spot
and
now
it
was
gerald
scales
turning
up
again
with
what
violence
was
the
direction
of
their
thoughts
now
shifted
the
wickedness
of
maids
was
a
trifle
the
death
of
pets
was
a
trifle
but
the
reappearance
of
gerald
scales
that
involved
the
possibility
of
consequences
which
could
not
even
be
named
so
afflictive
was
the
mere
prospect
to
them
constance
was
speechless
and
she
saw
that
sophia
was
also
speechless
of
course
the
event
had
been
bound
to
happen
people
do
not
vanish
never
to
be
heard
of
again
the
time
surely
arrives
when
the
secret
is
revealed
so
sophia
said
to
herself
now
she
had
always
refused
to
consider
the
effect
of
gerald
reappearance
she
had
put
the
idea
of
it
away
from
her
determined
to
convince
herself
that
she
had
done
with
him
finally
and
for
ever
she
had
forgotten
him
it
was
years
since
he
had
ceased
to
disturb
her
thoughts
many
years
he
must
be
dead
she
had
persuaded
herself
it
is
inconceivable
that
he
should
have
lived
on
and
never
come
across
me
if
he
had
been
alive
and
learnt
that
i
had
made
money
he
would
assuredly
have
come
to
me
no
he
must
be
dead
and
he
was
not
dead
the
brief
telegram
overwhelmingly
shocked
her
her
life
had
been
calm
regular
monotonous
and
now
it
was
thrown
into
an
indescribable
turmoil
by
five
words
of
a
telegram
suddenly
with
no
warning
whatever
sophia
had
the
right
to
say
to
herself
i
have
had
my
share
of
trouble
and
more
than
my
share
the
end
of
her
life
promised
to
be
as
awful
as
the
beginning
the
mere
existence
of
gerald
scales
was
a
menace
to
her
but
it
was
the
simple
impact
of
the
blow
that
affected
her
supremely
beyond
ulterior
things
one
might
have
pictured
fate
as
a
cowardly
brute
who
had
struck
this
ageing
woman
full
in
the
face
a
felling
blow
which
however
had
not
felled
her
she
staggered
but
she
stuck
on
her
legs
it
seemed
a
shame
one
of
those
crude
spectacular
shames
which
make
the
blood
boil
that
the
gallant
defenceless
creature
should
be
so
maltreated
by
the
bully
destiny
oh
sophia
constance
moaned
what
trouble
is
this
sophia
lip
curled
with
a
disgusted
air
under
that
she
hid
her
suffering
she
had
not
seen
him
for
years
he
must
be
over
seventy
years
of
age
and
he
had
turned
up
again
like
a
bad
penny
doubtless
a
disgrace
what
had
he
been
doing
in
those
years
he
was
an
old
enfeebled
man
now
he
must
be
a
pretty
sight
and
he
lay
at
manchester
not
two
hours
away
whatever
feelings
were
in
sophia
heart
tenderness
was
not
among
them
as
she
collected
her
wits
from
the
stroke
she
was
principally
aware
of
the
sentiment
of
fear
she
recoiled
from
the
future
what
shall
you
do
constance
asked
constance
was
weeping
sophia
tapped
her
foot
glancing
out
of
the
window
shall
you
go
to
see
him
constance
continued
of
course
said
sophia
i
must
she
hated
the
thought
of
going
to
see
him
she
flinched
from
it
she
felt
herself
under
no
moral
obligation
to
go
why
should
she
go
gerald
was
nothing
to
her
and
had
no
claim
on
her
of
any
kind
this
she
honestly
believed
and
yet
she
knew
that
she
must
go
to
him
she
knew
it
to
be
impossible
that
she
should
not
go
now
demanded
constance
sophia
nodded
what
about
the
trains
oh
you
poor
dear
the
mere
idea
of
the
journey
to
manchester
put
constance
out
of
her
wits
seeming
a
business
of
unparalleled
complexity
and
difficulty
would
you
like
me
to
come
with
you
oh
no
i
must
go
by
myself
constance
was
relieved
by
this
they
could
not
have
left
the
servant
in
the
house
alone
and
the
idea
of
shutting
up
the
house
without
notice
or
preparation
presented
itself
to
constance
as
too
fantastic
by
a
common
instinct
they
both
descended
to
the
parlour
now
what
about
a
what
about
a
constance
mumbled
on
the
stairs
she
wiped
her
eyes
resolutely
i
wonder
whatever
in
this
world
has
brought
him
at
last
to
that
boldero
in
deansgate
she
asked
the
walls
as
they
came
into
the
parlour
a
great
drove
up
before
the
door
and
when
the
pulsations
of
its
engine
had
died
away
dick
povey
hobbled
from
the
driver
seat
to
the
pavement
in
an
instant
he
was
hammering
at
the
door
in
his
lively
style
there
was
no
avoiding
him
the
door
had
to
be
opened
sophia
opened
it
dick
povey
was
over
forty
but
he
looked
considerably
younger
despite
his
lameness
and
the
fact
that
his
lameness
tended
to
induce
corpulence
he
had
a
dashing
air
and
his
face
with
its
short
light
moustache
was
boyish
he
seemed
to
be
always
upon
some
joyous
adventure
well
aunties
he
greeted
the
sisters
having
perceived
constance
behind
sophia
he
often
so
addressed
them
has
stirling
warned
you
that
i
was
coming
why
have
you
got
your
things
on
sophia
observed
a
young
woman
in
the
car
yes
said
he
following
her
gaze
you
may
as
well
look
come
down
miss
come
down
lily
you
got
to
go
through
with
it
the
young
woman
delicately
confused
and
blushing
obeyed
this
is
miss
lily
holl
he
went
on
i
do
know
whether
you
would
remember
her
i
do
think
you
do
it
not
often
she
comes
to
the
square
but
of
course
she
knows
you
by
sight
granddaughter
of
your
old
neighbour
alderman
holl
we
are
engaged
to
be
married
if
you
please
constance
and
sophia
could
not
decently
pour
out
their
griefs
on
the
top
of
such
news
the
betrothed
pair
had
to
come
in
and
be
congratulated
upon
their
entry
into
the
large
realms
of
mutual
love
but
the
sisters
even
in
their
painful
quandary
could
not
help
noticing
what
a
nice
quiet
ladylike
girl
lily
holl
was
her
one
fault
appeared
to
be
that
she
was
too
quiet
dick
povey
was
not
the
man
to
pass
time
in
formalities
and
he
was
soon
urging
departure
i
sorry
we
ca
come
said
sophia
i
got
to
go
to
manchester
now
we
are
in
great
trouble
yes
in
great
trouble
constance
weakly
echoed
dick
face
clouded
sympathetically
and
both
the
affianced
began
to
see
that
to
which
the
egotism
of
their
happiness
had
blinded
them
they
felt
that
long
long
years
had
elapsed
since
these
ageing
ladies
had
experienced
the
delights
which
they
were
feeling
trouble
i
sorry
to
hear
that
said
dick
can
you
tell
me
the
trains
to
manchester
asked
sophia
no
said
dick
quickly
but
i
can
drive
you
there
quicker
than
any
train
if
it
urgent
where
do
you
want
to
go
to
deansgate
sophia
faltered
look
here
said
dick
it
three
put
yourself
in
my
hands
i
guarantee
at
deansgate
you
shall
be
before
five
i
look
after
you
but
there
is
any
i
quite
free
for
the
afternoon
and
evening
at
first
the
suggestion
seemed
absurd
especially
to
constance
but
really
it
was
too
tempting
to
be
declined
while
sophia
made
ready
for
the
journey
dick
and
lily
holl
and
constance
conversed
in
low
solemn
tones
the
pair
were
waiting
to
be
enlightened
as
to
the
nature
of
the
trouble
constance
however
did
not
enlighten
them
how
could
constance
say
to
them
sophia
has
a
husband
that
she
has
seen
for
years
and
he
dangerously
ill
and
they
telegraphed
for
her
to
go
constance
could
not
it
did
not
even
occur
to
constance
to
order
a
cup
of
tea
iii
dick
povey
kept
his
word
at
a
five
he
drew
up
in
front
of
no
deansgate
manchester
there
you
are
he
said
not
without
pride
now
we
come
back
in
about
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
just
to
take
your
orders
whatever
they
are
he
was
very
comforting
with
his
suggestion
that
in
him
sophia
had
a
sure
support
in
the
background
without
many
words
sophia
went
straight
into
the
shop
it
looked
like
a
jeweller
shop
and
a
shop
for
bargains
generally
only
the
conventional
sign
over
a
showed
that
at
heart
it
was
a
pawnbroker
till
boldero
did
a
nice
business
in
the
five
towns
and
in
other
centres
near
manchester
by
selling
or
nominally
second
hand
to
persons
who
wished
to
make
presents
to
other
persons
or
to
themselves
he
would
send
anything
by
post
on
approval
occasionally
he
came
to
the
five
towns
and
he
had
once
several
years
before
met
constance
they
had
talked
he
was
the
son
of
a
cousin
of
the
late
great
and
wealthy
boldero
sleeping
partner
in
birkinshaws
and
gerald
uncle
it
was
from
constance
that
he
had
learnt
of
sophia
return
to
bursley
constance
had
often
remarked
to
sophia
what
a
superior
man
till
boldero
was
the
shop
was
narrow
and
lofty
it
seemed
like
a
menagerie
for
trapped
in
glass
cases
right
up
to
the
dark
ceiling
silver
vessels
and
instruments
of
all
kinds
lay
confined
the
top
of
the
counter
was
a
glass
prison
containing
dozens
of
gold
watches
together
with
enamels
and
other
antiquities
the
front
of
the
counter
was
also
glazed
showing
vases
and
large
pieces
of
porcelain
a
few
pictures
in
heavy
gold
frames
were
perched
about
there
was
a
case
of
umbrellas
with
elaborate
handles
and
rich
tassels
there
were
a
couple
of
statuettes
the
counter
on
the
customers
side
ended
in
a
glass
screen
on
which
were
the
words
office
on
the
seller
side
the
prospect
was
closed
by
a
vast
safe
a
tall
young
man
was
fumbling
in
this
safe
two
women
sat
on
customers
chairs
leaning
against
the
crystal
counter
the
young
man
came
towards
them
from
the
safe
bearing
a
tray
how
much
is
that
goblet
asked
one
of
the
women
raising
her
parasol
dangerously
among
such
fragility
and
pointing
to
one
object
among
many
in
a
case
high
up
from
the
ground
that
madam
yes
pounds
the
young
man
disposed
his
tray
on
the
counter
it
was
packed
with
more
gold
watches
adding
to
the
extraordinary
glitter
and
shimmer
of
the
shop
he
chose
a
small
watch
from
the
regiment
now
this
is
something
i
can
recommend
he
said
it
made
by
cuthbert
butler
of
blackburn
i
can
guarantee
you
that
for
five
years
he
spoke
as
though
he
were
the
accredited
representative
of
the
bank
of
england
with
calm
and
absolute
assurance
the
effect
upon
sophia
was
mysteriously
soothing
she
felt
that
she
was
among
honest
men
the
young
man
raised
his
head
towards
her
with
a
questioning
deferential
gesture
can
i
see
mr
boldero
she
asked
mrs
scales
the
young
man
face
changed
instantly
to
a
sympathetic
comprehension
yes
madam
i
fetch
him
at
once
said
he
and
he
disappeared
behind
the
safe
the
two
customers
discussed
the
watch
then
the
door
opened
in
the
glass
screen
and
a
portly
man
showed
himself
he
was
dressed
in
blue
with
a
collar
and
a
small
black
tie
his
waistcoat
displayed
a
plain
but
heavy
gold
and
his
were
of
plain
gold
his
were
he
had
grey
hair
beard
and
moustache
but
on
the
backs
of
his
hands
grew
a
light
brown
hair
his
appearance
was
strangely
mild
dignified
and
he
was
in
fact
one
of
the
most
respected
tradesmen
in
manchester
he
peered
forward
looking
over
his
which
he
then
took
off
holding
them
up
in
the
air
by
their
short
handle
sophia
had
approached
him
mrs
scales
he
said
in
a
very
quiet
very
benevolent
voice
sophia
nodded
please
come
this
way
he
took
her
hand
squeezing
it
commiseratingly
and
drew
her
into
the
sanctum
i
did
expect
you
so
soon
he
said
i
looked
up
th
trains
and
i
did
see
how
you
could
get
here
before
six
sophia
explained
he
led
her
further
through
the
private
office
into
a
sort
of
parlour
and
asked
her
to
sit
down
and
he
too
sat
down
sophia
waited
as
it
were
like
a
suitor
i
afraid
i
got
bad
news
for
you
scales
he
said
still
in
that
mild
benevolent
voice
he
dead
sophia
asked
till
boldero
nodded
he
dead
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
he
had
passed
away
before
i
telegraphed
it
all
happened
very
very
suddenly
he
paused
very
very
suddenly
yes
said
sophia
weakly
she
was
conscious
of
a
profound
sadness
which
was
not
grief
though
it
resembled
grief
and
she
had
also
a
feeling
that
she
was
responsible
to
till
boldero
for
anything
untoward
that
might
have
occurred
to
him
by
reason
of
gerald
yes
said
till
boldero
deliberately
and
softly
he
came
in
last
night
just
as
we
were
closing
we
had
very
heavy
rain
here
i
know
how
it
was
with
you
he
was
wet
in
a
dreadful
state
simply
dreadful
of
course
i
did
recognize
him
i
never
seen
him
before
so
far
as
my
recollection
goes
he
asked
me
if
i
was
the
son
of
till
boldero
that
had
this
shop
in
i
said
i
was
he
says
the
only
connection
i
got
my
name
gerald
scales
my
mother
was
your
father
cousin
can
you
do
anything
for
me
he
says
i
could
see
he
was
ill
i
had
him
in
here
when
i
found
he
could
eat
nor
drink
i
thought
i
happen
better
send
for
th
doctor
the
doctor
got
him
to
bed
he
passed
away
at
one
this
afternoon
i
was
very
sorry
my
wife
was
here
to
look
after
things
a
bit
better
but
she
at
southport
not
well
at
all
what
was
it
sophia
asked
briefly
boldero
indicated
the
enigmatic
exhaustion
i
suppose
he
replied
he
here
demanded
sophia
lifting
her
eyes
to
possible
bedrooms
yes
said
boldero
i
suppose
you
would
wish
to
see
him
yes
said
sophia
you
have
seen
him
for
a
long
time
your
sister
told
me
boldero
murmured
sympathetically
not
since
said
sophia
eh
dear
eh
dear
ejaculated
boldero
i
fear
it
been
a
sad
business
for
ye
scales
not
since
he
sighed
you
must
take
it
as
well
as
you
can
i
not
one
as
talks
much
but
i
sympathize
with
you
i
do
that
i
wish
my
wife
had
been
here
to
receive
you
tears
came
into
sophia
eyes
nay
nay
he
said
you
must
bear
up
now
it
you
that
make
me
cry
said
sophia
gratefully
you
were
very
good
to
take
him
in
it
must
have
been
exceedingly
trying
for
you
oh
he
protested
you
must
talk
like
that
i
could
leave
a
boldero
on
the
pavement
and
an
old
man
at
that
oh
to
think
that
if
he
only
managed
to
please
his
uncle
he
might
ha
been
one
of
the
richest
men
in
lancashire
but
then
there
ha
been
no
boldero
institute
at
strangeways
he
added
they
both
sat
silent
a
moment
will
you
come
now
or
will
you
wait
a
bit
asked
boldero
gently
just
as
you
wish
i
sorry
as
my
wife
away
that
i
am
i
come
now
said
sophia
firmly
but
she
was
stricken
he
conducted
her
up
a
short
dark
flight
of
stairs
which
gave
on
a
passage
and
at
the
end
of
the
passage
was
a
door
ajar
he
pushed
the
door
open
i
leave
you
for
a
moment
he
said
always
in
the
same
very
restrained
tone
you
find
me
downstairs
there
if
you
want
me
and
he
moved
away
with
hushed
deliberate
tread
sophia
went
into
the
room
of
which
the
white
blind
was
drawn
she
appreciated
boldero
consideration
in
leaving
her
she
was
trembling
but
when
she
saw
in
the
pale
gloom
the
face
of
an
aged
man
peeping
out
from
under
a
white
sheet
on
a
naked
mattress
she
started
back
trembling
no
more
rather
transfixed
into
an
absolute
rigidity
that
was
no
conventional
expected
shock
that
she
had
received
it
was
a
genuine
unforeseen
shock
the
most
violent
that
she
had
ever
had
in
her
mind
she
had
not
pictured
gerald
as
a
very
old
man
she
knew
that
he
was
old
she
had
said
to
herself
that
he
must
be
very
old
well
over
seventy
but
she
had
not
pictured
him
this
face
on
the
bed
was
painfully
pitiably
old
a
withered
face
with
the
shiny
skin
all
drawn
into
wrinkles
the
stretched
skin
under
the
jaw
was
like
the
skin
of
a
plucked
fowl
the
stood
up
and
below
them
were
deep
hollows
almost
like
a
short
scraggy
white
beard
covered
the
lower
part
of
the
face
the
hair
was
scanty
irregular
and
quite
white
a
little
white
hair
grew
in
the
ears
the
shut
mouth
obviously
hid
toothless
gums
for
the
lips
were
sucked
in
the
eyelids
were
as
if
pasted
down
over
the
eyes
fitting
them
like
kid
all
the
skin
was
extremely
pallid
it
seemed
brittle
the
body
whose
outlines
were
clear
under
the
sheet
was
very
small
thin
shrunk
pitiable
as
the
face
and
on
the
face
was
a
general
expression
of
final
fatigue
of
tragic
and
acute
exhaustion
such
as
made
sophia
pleased
that
the
fatigue
and
exhaustion
had
been
assuaged
in
rest
while
all
the
time
she
kept
thinking
to
herself
horribly
oh
how
tired
he
must
have
been
sophia
then
experienced
a
pure
and
primitive
emotion
uncoloured
by
any
moral
or
religious
quality
she
was
not
sorry
that
gerald
had
wasted
his
life
nor
that
he
was
a
shame
to
his
years
and
to
her
the
manner
of
his
life
was
of
no
importance
what
affected
her
was
that
he
had
once
been
young
and
that
he
had
grown
old
and
was
now
dead
that
was
all
youth
and
vigour
had
come
to
that
youth
and
vigour
always
came
to
that
everything
came
to
that
he
had
her
he
had
abandoned
her
he
had
been
a
devious
rascal
but
how
trivial
were
such
accusations
against
him
the
whole
of
her
huge
and
bitter
grievance
against
him
fell
to
pieces
and
crumbled
she
saw
him
young
and
proud
and
strong
as
for
instance
when
he
had
kissed
her
lying
on
the
bed
in
that
london
hotel
she
forgot
the
name
in
and
now
he
was
old
and
worn
and
horrible
and
dead
it
was
the
riddle
of
life
that
was
puzzling
and
killing
her
by
the
corner
of
her
eye
reflected
in
the
mirror
of
a
wardrobe
near
the
bed
she
glimpsed
a
tall
forlorn
woman
who
had
once
been
young
and
now
was
old
who
had
once
exulted
in
abundant
strength
and
trodden
proudly
on
the
neck
of
circumstance
and
now
was
old
he
and
she
had
once
loved
and
burned
and
quarrelled
in
the
glittering
and
scornful
pride
of
youth
but
time
had
worn
them
out
yet
a
little
while
she
thought
and
i
shall
be
lying
on
a
bed
like
that
and
what
shall
i
have
lived
for
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
the
riddle
of
life
itself
was
killing
her
and
she
seemed
to
drown
in
a
sea
of
inexpressible
sorrow
her
memory
wandered
hopelessly
among
those
past
years
she
saw
chirac
with
his
wistful
smile
she
saw
him
whipped
over
the
roof
of
the
gare
du
nord
at
the
tail
of
a
balloon
she
saw
old
niepce
she
felt
his
lecherous
arm
round
her
she
was
as
old
now
as
niepce
had
been
then
could
she
excite
lust
now
ah
the
irony
of
such
a
question
to
be
young
and
seductive
to
be
able
to
kindle
a
man
eye
that
seemed
to
her
the
sole
thing
desirable
once
she
had
been
so
niepce
must
certainly
have
been
dead
for
years
niepce
the
obstinate
and
hopeful
voluptuary
was
nothing
but
a
few
bones
in
a
coffin
now
she
was
acquainted
with
affliction
in
that
hour
all
that
she
had
previously
suffered
sank
into
insignificance
by
the
side
of
that
suffering
she
turned
to
the
veiled
window
and
idly
pulled
the
blind
and
looked
out
huge
red
and
yellow
cars
were
swimming
in
thunder
along
deansgate
lorries
jolted
and
rattled
the
people
of
manchester
hurried
along
the
pavements
apparently
unconscious
that
all
their
doings
were
vain
yesterday
he
too
had
been
in
deansgate
hungry
for
life
hating
the
idea
of
death
what
a
figure
he
must
have
made
her
heart
dissolved
in
pity
for
him
she
dropped
the
blind
my
life
has
been
too
terrible
she
thought
i
wish
i
was
dead
i
have
been
through
too
much
it
is
monstrous
and
i
can
not
stand
it
i
do
not
want
to
die
but
i
wish
i
was
dead
there
was
a
discreet
knock
on
the
door
come
in
she
said
in
a
calm
resigned
cheerful
voice
the
sound
had
recalled
her
with
the
swiftness
of
a
miracle
to
the
unconquerable
dignity
of
human
pride
till
boldero
entered
i
should
like
you
to
come
downstairs
and
drink
a
cup
of
tea
he
said
he
was
a
marvel
of
tact
and
good
nature
my
wife
is
unfortunately
not
here
and
the
house
is
rather
at
sixes
and
sevens
but
i
have
sent
out
for
some
tea
she
followed
him
downstairs
into
the
parlour
he
poured
out
a
cup
of
tea
i
was
forgetting
she
said
i
am
forbidden
tea
i
must
drink
it
she
looked
at
the
cup
tremendously
tempted
she
longed
for
tea
an
occasional
transgression
could
not
harm
her
but
no
she
would
not
drink
it
then
what
can
i
get
you
if
i
could
have
just
milk
and
water
she
said
meekly
boldero
emptied
the
cup
into
the
slop
basin
and
began
to
fill
it
again
did
he
tell
you
anything
she
asked
after
a
considerable
silence
nothing
said
boldero
in
his
low
soothing
tones
nothing
except
that
he
had
come
from
liverpool
judging
from
his
shoes
i
should
say
he
must
have
walked
a
good
bit
of
the
way
at
his
age
murmured
sophia
touched
yes
sighed
boldero
he
must
have
been
in
great
straits
you
know
he
could
scarcely
talk
at
all
by
the
way
here
are
his
clothes
i
have
had
them
put
aside
sophia
saw
a
small
pile
of
clothes
on
a
chair
she
examined
the
suit
which
was
still
damp
and
its
woeful
shabbiness
pained
her
the
linen
collar
was
nearly
black
its
stud
of
bone
as
for
the
boots
she
had
noticed
such
boots
on
the
feet
of
tramps
she
wept
now
these
were
the
clothes
of
him
who
had
once
been
a
dandy
living
at
the
rate
of
fifty
pounds
a
week
no
luggage
or
anything
of
course
she
muttered
no
said
boldero
in
the
pockets
there
was
nothing
whatever
but
this
he
went
to
the
mantelpiece
and
picked
up
a
cheap
cracked
letter
case
which
sophia
opened
in
it
were
a
visiting
card
clemenzia
borja
and
a
of
the
hotel
of
the
holy
spirit
concepcion
del
uruguay
on
the
back
of
which
a
lot
of
figures
had
been
scrawled
one
would
suppose
said
boldero
that
he
had
come
from
south
america
nothing
else
nothing
gerald
soul
had
not
been
compelled
to
abandon
much
in
the
haste
of
its
flight
a
servant
announced
that
scales
friends
were
waiting
for
her
outside
in
the
sophia
glanced
at
till
boldero
with
an
exacerbated
anxiety
on
her
face
surely
they
do
expect
me
to
go
back
with
them
tonight
she
said
and
look
at
all
there
is
to
be
done
till
boldero
kindness
was
then
redoubled
you
can
do
nothing
for
him
now
he
said
tell
me
your
wishes
about
the
funeral
i
will
arrange
everything
go
back
to
your
sister
she
will
be
nervous
about
you
and
return
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
no
it
no
trouble
i
assure
you
she
yielded
thus
towards
eight
when
sophia
had
eaten
a
little
under
boldero
superintendence
and
the
pawnshop
was
shut
up
the
started
again
for
bursley
lily
holl
being
beside
her
lover
and
sophia
alone
in
the
body
of
the
car
sophia
had
told
them
nothing
of
the
nature
of
her
mission
she
was
incapable
of
talking
to
them
they
saw
that
she
was
in
a
condition
of
serious
mental
disturbance
under
cover
of
the
noise
of
the
car
lily
said
to
dick
that
she
was
sure
scales
was
ill
and
dick
putting
his
lips
together
replied
that
he
meant
to
be
in
king
street
at
at
the
latest
from
time
to
time
lily
surreptitiously
glanced
at
sophia
a
glance
of
apprehensive
inspection
or
smiled
at
her
silently
and
sophia
vaguely
responded
to
the
smile
in
half
an
hour
they
had
escaped
from
the
ring
of
manchester
and
were
on
the
county
roads
of
cheshire
polished
flat
sinuous
it
was
the
season
of
the
year
when
there
is
no
night
only
daylight
and
twilight
when
the
last
silver
of
dusk
remains
obstinately
visible
for
hours
and
in
the
open
country
under
the
melancholy
arch
of
evening
the
sadness
of
the
earth
seemed
to
possess
sophia
anew
only
then
did
she
realize
the
intensity
of
the
ordeal
through
which
she
was
passing
to
the
south
of
congleton
one
of
the
tyres
softened
immediately
after
dick
had
lighted
his
lamps
he
stopped
the
car
and
got
down
again
they
were
two
miles
astbury
the
nearest
village
he
had
just
with
the
resignation
of
experience
reached
for
the
when
lily
exclaimed
is
she
asleep
or
what
sophia
was
not
asleep
but
she
was
apparently
not
conscious
it
was
a
difficult
and
a
trying
situation
for
two
lovers
their
voices
changed
momentarily
to
the
tone
of
alarm
and
consternation
and
then
grew
firm
again
sophia
showed
life
but
not
reason
lily
could
feel
the
poor
old
lady
heart
well
there
nothing
for
it
said
dick
briefly
when
all
their
efforts
failed
to
rouse
her
what
shall
you
do
go
straight
home
as
quick
as
i
can
on
three
tyres
we
must
get
her
over
to
this
side
and
you
must
hold
her
like
that
we
shall
keep
the
weight
off
the
other
side
he
pitched
back
the
into
its
box
lily
admired
his
decision
it
was
in
this
order
no
longer
under
the
spell
of
the
changing
beauty
of
nocturnal
landscapes
that
they
finished
the
journey
constance
had
opened
the
door
before
the
car
came
to
a
stop
in
the
gloom
of
king
street
the
young
people
considered
that
she
bore
the
shock
well
though
the
carrying
into
the
house
of
sophia
inert
twitching
body
with
its
hat
forlornly
awry
was
a
sight
to
harrow
a
soul
sturdier
than
constance
when
that
was
done
dick
said
curtly
i
off
you
stay
here
of
course
where
are
you
going
asked
lily
doctor
snapped
dick
hobbling
rapidly
down
the
steps
iv
the
extraordinary
violence
of
the
turn
in
affairs
was
what
chiefly
struck
constance
though
it
did
not
overwhelm
her
less
than
twelve
hours
before
nay
scarcely
six
hours
before
she
and
sophia
had
been
living
their
placid
and
monotonous
existence
undisturbed
by
anything
worse
than
the
indisposition
or
death
of
dogs
or
the
perversity
of
a
servant
and
now
the
menacing
gerald
scales
having
reappeared
sophia
form
lay
mysterious
and
affrightening
on
the
sofa
and
she
and
lily
holl
a
girl
whom
she
had
not
met
till
that
day
were
staring
at
sophia
side
by
side
intimately
sharing
the
same
alarm
constance
rose
to
the
crisis
she
no
longer
had
sophia
energy
and
decisive
peremptoriness
to
depend
on
and
the
baines
in
her
was
awakened
all
her
daily
troubles
sank
away
to
their
proper
scale
of
unimportance
neither
the
young
woman
nor
the
old
one
knew
what
to
do
they
could
loosen
clothes
vainly
offer
restoratives
to
the
smitten
mouth
that
was
all
sophia
was
not
unconscious
as
could
be
judged
from
her
eyes
but
she
could
not
speak
nor
make
signs
her
body
was
frequently
convulsed
so
the
two
women
waited
and
the
servant
waited
in
the
background
the
sight
of
sophia
had
effected
an
astonishing
transformation
in
maud
maud
was
a
changed
girl
constance
could
not
recognize
in
her
eager
deferential
anxiety
to
be
of
use
the
pert
naughtiness
of
the
minx
she
was
altered
as
a
wanton
of
the
middle
ages
would
have
been
altered
by
some
miraculous
visitation
it
might
have
been
the
in
maud
career
doctor
stirling
arrived
in
less
than
ten
minutes
dick
povey
had
had
the
wit
to
look
for
him
at
the
federation
meeting
in
the
town
hall
and
the
advent
of
the
doctor
and
dick
noisily
at
breakneck
speed
in
the
car
provided
a
second
sensation
the
doctor
inquired
quickly
what
had
occurred
nobody
could
tell
him
anything
constance
had
already
confided
to
lily
holl
the
reason
of
the
visit
to
manchester
but
that
was
the
extent
of
her
knowledge
not
a
single
person
in
bursley
except
sophia
knew
what
had
happened
in
manchester
but
constance
conjectured
that
gerald
scales
was
dead
or
sophia
would
never
have
returned
so
soon
then
the
doctor
suggested
that
on
the
contrary
gerald
scales
might
be
out
of
danger
and
all
then
pictured
to
themselves
this
troubling
gerald
scales
this
dark
and
sinister
husband
that
had
caused
such
a
violent
upheaval
meanwhile
the
doctor
was
at
work
he
sent
dick
povey
to
knock
up
critchlow
if
the
shop
should
be
closed
and
obtain
a
drug
then
after
a
time
he
lifted
sophia
just
as
she
was
like
a
bundle
on
his
shoulder
and
carried
her
upstairs
to
the
second
floor
he
had
recently
been
giving
a
course
of
instruction
to
enthusiasts
of
the
john
ambulance
association
in
bursley
the
feat
had
an
air
of
the
superhuman
above
all
else
it
remained
printed
on
constance
mind
the
burly
doctor
treading
delicately
and
carefully
on
the
crooked
creaking
stairs
his
precautions
against
damaging
sophia
by
brusque
contacts
his
stumble
at
the
two
steps
in
the
middle
of
the
corridor
sophia
horribly
limp
head
and
loosened
hair
and
then
the
tender
placing
of
her
on
the
bed
and
the
doctor
long
breath
and
flourish
of
his
large
handkerchief
all
that
under
the
crude
lights
and
shadows
of
gas
jets
the
doctor
was
nonplussed
constance
gave
him
a
account
of
sophia
original
attack
in
paris
roughly
as
she
had
heard
it
from
sophia
he
at
once
said
that
it
could
not
have
been
what
the
french
doctor
had
said
it
was
constance
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
was
not
surprised
for
her
there
was
necessarily
something
of
the
charlatan
about
a
french
doctor
she
said
she
only
knew
what
sophia
had
told
her
after
a
time
stirling
determined
to
try
electricity
and
dick
povey
drove
him
up
to
the
surgery
to
fetch
his
apparatus
the
women
were
left
alone
again
constance
was
very
deeply
impressed
by
lily
holl
sensible
sympathetic
attitude
whatever
i
should
have
done
without
miss
lily
i
do
know
she
used
to
exclaim
afterwards
even
maud
was
beyond
praise
it
seemed
to
be
the
middle
of
the
night
when
stirling
came
back
but
it
was
barely
eleven
and
people
were
only
just
returning
from
hanbridge
theatre
and
hanbridge
music
hall
the
use
of
the
electrical
apparatus
was
a
dead
spectacle
sophia
inertness
under
it
was
agonizing
they
waited
as
it
were
breathless
for
the
result
and
there
was
no
result
both
injections
and
electricity
had
entirely
failed
to
influence
the
paralysis
of
mouth
and
throat
everything
had
failed
nothing
to
do
but
wait
a
bit
said
the
doctor
quietly
they
waited
in
the
chamber
sophia
seemed
to
be
in
a
kind
of
coma
the
distortion
of
her
handsome
face
was
more
marked
as
time
passed
the
doctor
spoke
now
and
then
in
a
low
voice
he
said
that
the
attack
had
ultimately
been
determined
by
cold
produced
by
rapid
motion
in
the
automobile
dick
povey
whispered
that
he
must
run
over
to
hanbridge
and
let
lily
parents
know
that
there
was
no
cause
for
alarm
on
her
account
and
that
he
would
return
at
once
he
was
very
devoted
on
the
landing
the
bedroom
the
doctor
murmured
to
him
and
dick
nodded
they
were
great
friends
at
intervals
the
doctor
who
never
knew
when
he
was
beaten
essayed
new
methods
of
dealing
with
sophia
case
new
symptoms
followed
it
was
twelve
when
after
gazing
with
prolonged
intensity
at
the
patient
and
after
having
tested
her
mouth
and
heart
he
rose
slowly
and
looked
at
constance
it
over
said
constance
and
he
very
slightly
moved
his
head
come
downstairs
please
he
enjoined
her
in
a
pause
that
ensued
constance
was
amazingly
courageous
the
doctor
was
very
solemn
and
very
kind
constance
had
never
before
seen
him
to
such
heroic
advantage
he
led
her
with
infinite
gentleness
out
of
the
room
there
was
nothing
to
stay
for
sophia
had
gone
constance
wanted
to
stay
by
sophia
body
but
it
was
the
rule
that
the
stricken
should
be
led
away
the
doctor
observed
this
classic
rule
and
constance
felt
that
he
was
right
and
that
she
must
obey
lily
holl
followed
the
servant
learning
the
truth
by
the
intuition
accorded
to
primitive
natures
burst
into
loud
sobs
yelling
that
sophia
had
been
the
most
excellent
mistress
that
servant
ever
had
the
doctor
angrily
told
her
not
to
stand
blubbering
there
but
to
go
into
her
kitchen
and
shut
the
door
if
she
could
control
herself
all
his
accumulated
nervous
agitation
was
discharged
on
maud
like
a
thunderclap
constance
continued
to
behave
wonderfully
she
was
the
admiration
of
the
doctor
and
lily
holl
then
dick
povey
came
back
it
was
settled
that
lily
should
pass
the
night
with
constance
at
last
the
doctor
and
dick
departed
together
the
doctor
undertaking
the
mortuary
arrangements
maud
was
hunted
to
bed
early
in
the
morning
constance
rose
up
from
her
own
bed
it
was
five
and
there
had
been
daylight
for
two
hours
already
she
moved
noiselessly
and
peeped
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
at
the
sofa
lily
was
quietly
asleep
there
breathing
with
the
softness
of
a
child
lily
would
have
deemed
that
she
was
a
very
mature
woman
who
had
seen
life
and
much
of
it
yet
to
constance
her
face
and
attitude
had
the
exquisite
quality
of
a
child
she
was
not
precisely
a
pretty
girl
but
her
features
the
candid
expression
of
her
disposition
produced
an
impression
that
was
akin
to
that
of
beauty
her
abandonment
was
complete
she
had
gone
through
the
night
unscathed
and
was
now
renewing
herself
in
calm
oblivious
sleep
her
ingenuous
girlishness
was
apparent
then
it
seemed
as
if
all
her
wise
and
sweet
behaviour
of
the
evening
could
have
been
nothing
but
so
many
imitative
gestures
it
seemed
impossible
that
a
being
so
young
and
fresh
could
have
really
experienced
the
mood
of
which
her
gestures
had
been
the
expression
her
strong
virginal
simplicity
made
constance
vaguely
sad
for
her
creeping
out
of
the
room
constance
climbed
to
the
second
floor
in
her
and
entered
the
other
chamber
she
was
obliged
to
look
again
upon
sophia
body
incredible
swiftness
of
calamity
who
could
have
foreseen
it
constance
was
less
desolated
than
numbed
she
was
as
yet
only
touching
the
fringe
of
her
bereavement
she
had
not
begun
to
think
of
herself
she
was
drenched
as
she
gazed
at
sophia
body
not
by
pity
for
herself
but
by
compassion
for
the
immense
disaster
of
her
sister
life
she
perceived
fully
now
for
the
first
time
the
greatness
of
that
disaster
sophia
charm
and
sophia
beauty
what
profit
had
they
been
to
their
owner
she
saw
pictures
of
sophia
career
distorted
and
grotesque
images
formed
in
her
untravelled
mind
from
sophia
own
rare
and
compressed
recitals
what
a
career
a
brief
passion
and
then
nearly
thirty
years
in
a
and
sophia
had
never
had
a
child
had
never
known
either
the
joy
or
the
pain
of
maternity
she
had
never
even
had
a
true
home
till
in
all
her
sterile
splendour
she
came
to
bursley
and
she
had
ended
thus
this
was
the
piteous
ignominious
end
of
sophia
wondrous
gifts
of
body
and
soul
hers
had
not
been
a
life
at
all
and
the
reason
it
is
strange
how
fate
persists
in
justifying
the
harsh
generalizations
of
puritan
morals
of
the
morals
in
which
constance
had
been
brought
up
by
her
stern
parents
sophia
had
sinned
it
was
therefore
inevitable
that
she
should
suffer
an
adventure
such
as
she
had
in
wicked
and
capricious
pride
undertaken
with
gerald
scales
could
not
conclude
otherwise
than
it
had
concluded
it
could
have
brought
nothing
but
evil
there
was
no
getting
away
from
these
verities
thought
constance
and
she
was
to
be
excused
for
thinking
that
all
modern
progress
and
cleverness
was
as
naught
and
that
the
world
would
be
forced
to
return
upon
its
steps
and
start
again
in
the
path
which
it
had
left
up
to
within
a
few
days
of
her
death
people
had
been
wont
to
remark
that
scales
looked
as
young
as
ever
and
that
she
was
as
bright
and
as
energetic
as
ever
and
truly
regarding
sophia
from
a
little
distance
that
handsome
oval
that
erect
carriage
of
a
slim
body
that
challenging
eye
no
one
would
have
said
that
she
was
in
her
sixtieth
year
but
look
at
her
now
with
her
twisted
face
her
sightless
orbs
her
worn
skin
she
did
not
seem
sixty
but
seventy
she
was
like
something
used
exhausted
and
thrown
aside
yes
constance
heart
melted
in
an
anguished
pity
for
that
stormy
creature
and
mingled
with
the
pity
was
a
stern
recognition
of
the
handiwork
of
divine
justice
to
constance
lips
came
the
same
phrase
as
had
come
to
the
lips
of
samuel
povey
on
a
different
occasion
god
is
not
mocked
the
ideas
of
her
parents
and
her
grandparents
had
survived
intact
in
constance
it
is
true
that
constance
father
would
have
shuddered
in
heaven
could
he
have
seen
constance
solitarily
playing
cards
of
a
night
but
in
spite
of
cards
and
of
a
son
who
never
went
to
chapel
constance
under
the
various
influences
of
destiny
had
remained
essentially
what
her
father
had
been
not
in
her
was
the
force
of
evolution
manifest
there
are
thousands
such
lily
awake
and
reclothed
with
that
unreal
mien
of
a
grown
and
comprehending
woman
stepped
quietly
into
the
room
searching
for
the
poor
old
thing
constance
the
had
come
by
the
first
post
was
delivered
a
letter
addressed
to
sophia
by
till
boldero
from
its
contents
the
death
of
gerald
scales
was
clear
there
seemed
then
to
be
nothing
else
for
constance
to
do
what
had
to
be
done
was
done
for
her
and
stronger
wills
than
hers
put
her
to
bed
cyril
was
telegraphed
for
critchlow
called
critchlow
following
a
fussy
infliction
but
useful
in
certain
matters
critchlow
was
not
allowed
to
see
constance
she
could
hear
his
high
grating
voice
in
the
corridor
she
had
to
lie
calm
and
the
sudden
tranquillity
seemed
strange
after
the
feverish
violence
of
the
night
only
hours
since
and
she
had
been
worrying
about
the
death
of
a
dog
with
a
body
crying
for
sleep
she
dozed
off
thoughts
of
the
mystery
of
life
merging
into
the
incoherence
of
dreams
the
news
was
abroad
in
the
square
before
nine
there
were
persons
who
had
witnessed
the
arrival
of
the
motorcar
and
the
transfer
of
sophia
to
the
house
untruthful
rumours
had
spread
as
to
the
manner
of
gerald
scales
death
some
said
that
he
had
dramatically
committed
suicide
but
the
town
though
titillated
was
not
moved
as
it
would
have
been
moved
by
a
similar
event
twenty
years
or
even
ten
years
earlier
times
had
changed
in
bursley
bursley
was
more
sophisticated
than
in
the
old
days
constance
was
afraid
lest
cyril
despite
the
seriousness
of
the
occasion
might
exhibit
his
customary
tardiness
in
coming
she
had
long
since
learnt
not
to
rely
upon
him
but
he
came
the
same
evening
his
behaviour
was
in
every
way
perfect
he
showed
quiet
but
genuine
grief
for
the
death
of
his
aunt
and
he
was
a
model
of
consideration
for
his
mother
further
he
at
once
assumed
charge
of
all
the
arrangements
in
regard
both
to
sophia
and
to
her
husband
constance
was
surprised
at
the
ease
which
he
displayed
in
the
conduct
of
practical
affairs
and
the
assurance
with
which
he
gave
orders
she
had
never
seen
him
direct
anything
before
he
said
indeed
that
he
had
never
directed
anything
before
but
that
there
appeared
to
him
to
be
no
difficulties
whereas
constance
had
figured
a
tiresome
series
of
varied
complications
as
to
the
burial
of
sophia
cyril
was
vigorously
in
favour
of
an
absolutely
private
funeral
that
is
to
say
a
funeral
at
which
none
but
himself
should
be
present
he
seemed
to
have
a
passionate
objection
to
any
sort
of
parade
constance
agreed
with
him
but
she
said
that
it
would
be
impossible
not
to
invite
critchlow
sophia
trustee
and
that
if
critchlow
were
invited
certain
others
must
be
invited
cyril
asked
why
impossible
constance
said
because
it
would
be
impossible
because
critchlow
would
be
hurt
cyril
asked
what
does
it
matter
if
he
is
hurt
and
suggested
that
critchlow
would
get
over
his
damage
constance
grew
more
serious
the
discussion
threatened
to
be
warm
suddenly
cyril
yielded
all
right
plover
all
right
it
shall
be
exactly
as
you
choose
he
said
in
a
gentle
humouring
tone
he
had
not
called
her
plover
for
years
she
thought
the
hour
badly
chosen
for
verbal
pleasantry
but
he
was
so
kind
that
she
made
no
complaint
thus
there
were
six
people
at
sophia
funeral
including
critchlow
no
refreshments
were
offered
the
mourners
separated
at
the
church
when
both
funerals
were
accomplished
cyril
sat
down
and
played
the
harmonium
softly
and
said
that
it
had
kept
well
in
tune
he
was
extraordinarily
soothing
he
had
now
reached
the
age
of
his
habits
were
as
industrious
as
ever
his
preoccupation
with
his
art
as
keen
but
he
had
achieved
no
fame
no
success
he
earned
nothing
living
in
comfort
on
an
allowance
from
his
mother
he
seldom
spoke
of
his
plans
and
never
of
his
hopes
he
had
in
fact
settled
down
into
a
dilletante
having
learnt
gently
to
scorn
the
triumphs
which
he
lacked
the
force
to
win
he
imagined
that
industry
and
a
regular
existence
were
sufficient
justification
in
themselves
for
any
man
life
constance
had
dropped
the
habit
of
expecting
him
to
astound
the
world
he
was
rather
grave
and
precise
in
manner
courteous
and
tepid
with
a
touch
of
condescension
towards
his
environment
as
though
he
were
continually
permitting
the
perspicacious
to
discern
that
he
had
nothing
to
learn
if
the
truth
were
known
his
humour
had
assumed
a
modified
form
he
often
smiled
to
himself
he
was
unexceptionable
on
the
day
after
sophia
funeral
he
set
to
work
to
design
a
simple
stone
for
his
aunt
tomb
he
said
he
could
not
tolerate
the
ordinary
gravestone
which
always
looked
to
him
as
if
the
wind
might
blow
it
over
thus
negativing
the
idea
of
solidity
his
mother
did
not
in
the
least
understand
him
she
thought
the
lettering
of
his
tombstone
affected
and
finicking
but
she
let
it
pass
without
comment
being
secretly
very
flattered
that
he
should
have
deigned
to
design
a
stone
at
all
sophia
had
left
all
her
money
to
cyril
and
had
made
him
the
sole
executor
of
her
will
this
arrangement
had
been
agreed
with
constance
the
sisters
thought
it
was
the
best
plan
cyril
ignored
critchlow
entirely
and
went
to
a
young
lawyer
at
hanbridge
a
friend
of
his
and
of
matthew
critchlow
aged
and
unaccustomed
to
interference
had
to
render
accounts
of
his
trusteeship
to
this
young
man
and
was
incensed
the
estate
was
proved
at
over
thousand
pounds
in
the
main
sophia
had
been
careful
and
had
even
been
parsimonious
she
had
often
told
constance
that
they
ought
to
spend
money
much
more
freely
and
she
had
had
a
few
brief
fits
of
extravagance
but
the
habit
of
stern
thrift
begun
in
and
practised
without
any
intermission
till
she
came
to
england
in
had
been
too
strong
for
her
theories
the
squandering
of
money
pained
her
and
she
could
not
in
her
age
devise
expensive
tastes
cyril
showed
no
emotion
whatever
on
learning
himself
the
inheritor
of
thousand
pounds
he
did
not
seem
to
care
he
spoke
of
the
sum
as
a
millionaire
might
have
spoken
of
it
in
justice
to
him
it
is
to
be
said
that
he
cared
nothing
for
wealth
except
in
so
far
as
wealth
could
gratify
his
eye
and
ear
trained
to
artistic
voluptuousness
but
for
his
mother
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
bursley
he
might
have
affected
a
little
satisfaction
his
mother
was
somewhat
hurt
his
behaviour
caused
her
to
revert
in
meditation
again
and
again
to
the
futility
of
sophia
career
and
the
waste
of
her
attributes
she
had
grown
old
and
hard
in
joyless
years
in
order
to
amass
this
money
which
cyril
would
spend
coldly
and
ungratefully
never
thinking
of
the
immense
effort
and
endless
sacrifice
which
had
gone
to
its
collection
he
would
spend
it
as
carelessly
as
though
he
had
picked
it
up
in
the
street
as
the
days
went
by
and
constance
realized
her
own
grief
she
also
realized
more
and
more
the
completeness
of
the
tragedy
of
life
headstrong
sophia
had
deceived
her
mother
and
for
the
deception
had
paid
with
thirty
years
of
melancholy
and
the
entire
frustration
of
her
proper
destiny
after
haunting
bursley
for
a
fortnight
in
elegant
black
cyril
said
without
any
warning
one
night
i
must
go
the
day
after
mater
and
he
told
her
of
a
journey
to
hungary
which
he
had
long
since
definitely
planned
with
matthew
and
which
could
not
be
postponed
as
it
comprised
he
had
hitherto
breathed
no
word
of
this
he
was
as
secretive
as
ever
as
to
her
holiday
he
suggested
that
she
should
arrange
to
go
away
with
the
holls
and
dick
povey
he
approved
of
lily
holl
and
of
dick
povey
of
dick
povey
he
said
one
of
the
most
remarkable
chaps
in
the
five
towns
and
he
had
the
air
of
having
made
dick
reputation
constance
knowing
there
was
no
appeal
accepted
the
sentence
of
loneliness
her
health
was
singularly
good
when
he
was
gone
she
said
to
herself
scarcely
a
fortnight
and
sophia
was
here
at
this
table
she
would
remember
every
now
and
then
with
a
faint
shock
that
poor
proud
masterful
sophia
was
dead
chapter
v
end
of
constance
i
when
on
a
june
afternoon
about
twelve
months
later
lily
holl
walked
into
povey
overlooking
the
square
she
found
a
calm
somewhat
optimistic
old
lady
older
than
her
years
which
were
little
more
than
sixty
whose
chief
enemies
were
sciatica
and
rheumatism
the
sciatica
was
a
dear
enemy
of
long
standing
always
affectionately
referred
to
by
the
forgiving
constance
as
sciatica
the
rheumatism
was
a
unprivileged
spoken
of
by
its
victim
apprehensively
and
yet
disdainfully
as
rheumatism
constance
was
now
very
stout
she
sat
in
a
low
between
the
oval
table
and
the
window
arrayed
in
black
silk
as
the
girl
lily
came
in
constance
lifted
her
head
with
a
bland
smile
and
lily
kissed
her
contentedly
lily
knew
that
she
was
a
welcome
visitor
these
two
had
become
as
intimate
as
the
difference
between
their
ages
would
permit
of
the
two
constance
was
the
more
frank
lily
as
well
as
constance
was
in
mourning
a
few
months
previously
her
aged
grandfather
the
grocer
had
died
the
second
of
his
two
sons
lily
father
had
then
left
the
business
established
by
the
brothers
at
hanbridge
in
order
to
manage
for
a
time
the
parent
business
in
luke
square
alderman
holl
death
had
delayed
lily
marriage
lily
took
tea
with
constance
or
at
any
rate
paid
a
call
four
or
five
times
a
week
she
listened
to
constance
everybody
considered
that
constance
had
splendidly
through
the
dreadful
affair
of
sophia
death
indeed
it
was
observed
that
she
was
more
philosophic
more
cheerful
more
sweet
than
she
had
been
for
many
years
the
truth
was
that
though
her
bereavement
had
been
the
cause
of
a
most
genuine
and
durable
sorrow
it
had
been
a
relief
to
her
when
constance
was
over
fifty
the
energetic
and
masterful
sophia
had
burst
in
upon
her
lethargic
tranquillity
and
very
seriously
disturbed
the
flow
of
old
habits
certainly
constance
had
fought
sophia
on
the
main
point
and
won
but
on
a
hundred
minor
points
she
had
either
lost
or
had
not
fought
sophia
had
been
much
for
constance
and
it
had
been
only
by
a
wearying
expenditure
of
nervous
force
that
constance
had
succeeded
in
holding
a
small
part
of
her
own
against
the
unconscious
domination
of
sophia
the
death
of
scales
had
put
an
end
to
all
the
strain
and
constance
had
been
once
again
mistress
in
house
constance
would
never
have
admitted
these
facts
even
to
herself
and
no
one
would
ever
have
dared
to
suggest
them
to
her
for
with
all
her
temperamental
mildness
she
had
her
formidable
side
she
was
slipping
a
photograph
into
a
photograph
album
more
photographs
lily
questioned
she
had
almost
exactly
the
same
benignant
smile
that
constance
had
she
seemed
to
be
the
personification
of
gentleness
one
of
those
that
some
capricious
men
occasionally
have
the
luck
to
marry
she
was
capable
with
a
touch
of
honest
simple
stupidity
all
her
character
was
displayed
in
the
tone
in
which
she
said
more
photographs
it
showed
an
eager
responsive
sympathy
with
constance
cult
for
photographs
also
a
slight
personal
fondness
for
photographs
also
a
dim
perception
that
a
cult
for
photographs
might
be
carried
to
the
ridiculous
and
a
kind
desire
to
hide
all
trace
of
this
perception
the
voice
was
thin
and
matched
the
pale
complexion
of
her
delicate
face
constance
eyes
had
a
quizzical
gleam
behind
her
spectacles
as
she
silently
held
up
the
photograph
for
lily
inspection
lily
sitting
down
lowered
the
corners
of
her
soft
lips
when
she
beheld
the
photograph
and
nodded
her
head
several
times
scarce
perceptibly
her
ladyship
has
just
given
it
to
me
whispered
constance
indeed
said
lily
with
an
extraordinary
accent
ladyship
was
the
last
and
best
of
constance
servants
a
really
excellent
creature
of
thirty
who
had
known
misfortune
and
who
must
assuredly
have
been
sent
to
constance
by
the
old
watchful
providence
they
on
together
nearly
perfectly
her
name
was
mary
after
ten
years
of
turmoil
constance
in
the
matter
of
servants
was
now
at
rest
yes
said
constance
she
named
it
to
me
several
times
about
having
her
photograph
taken
and
last
week
i
let
her
go
i
told
you
did
i
i
always
consider
her
in
every
way
all
her
little
fancies
and
everything
and
the
copies
came
i
would
hurt
her
feelings
for
anything
you
may
be
sure
she
take
a
look
into
the
album
next
time
she
cleans
the
room
constance
and
lily
exchanged
a
glance
agreeing
that
constance
had
affably
stretched
a
point
in
deciding
to
put
the
photograph
of
a
servant
between
the
same
covers
with
photographs
of
her
family
and
friends
it
was
doubtful
whether
such
a
thing
had
ever
been
done
before
one
photograph
usually
leads
to
another
and
one
photograph
album
to
another
photograph
album
pass
me
that
album
on
the
second
shelf
of
the
canterbury
my
dear
said
constance
lily
rose
vivaciously
as
though
to
see
the
album
on
the
second
shelf
of
the
canterbury
had
been
the
ambition
of
her
life
they
sat
side
by
side
at
the
table
lily
turning
over
the
pages
constance
for
all
her
vast
bulk
continually
made
little
nervous
movements
occasionally
she
would
sniff
and
occasionally
a
mysterious
noise
would
occur
in
her
chest
she
always
pretended
that
this
noise
was
a
cough
and
would
support
the
pretence
by
emitting
a
real
cough
immediately
after
it
why
exclaimed
lily
have
i
seen
that
before
i
do
know
my
dear
said
constance
have
you
it
was
a
photograph
of
sophia
taken
a
few
years
previously
by
very
nice
gentleman
whose
acquaintance
the
sisters
had
made
during
a
holiday
at
harrogate
it
portrayed
sophia
on
a
knoll
fronting
the
weather
it
scales
to
the
life
i
can
see
that
said
lily
yes
said
constance
whenever
there
was
a
wind
she
always
stood
like
that
and
took
long
deep
breaths
of
it
this
recollection
of
one
of
sophia
habits
recalled
the
whole
woman
to
constance
memory
and
drew
a
picture
of
her
character
for
the
girl
who
had
scarcely
known
her
it
not
like
ordinary
photographs
there
something
special
about
it
said
lily
enthusiastically
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
a
photograph
like
that
i
got
another
copy
of
it
in
my
bedroom
said
constance
i
give
you
this
one
oh
povey
i
could
think
yes
yes
said
constance
removing
the
photograph
from
the
page
oh
thank
you
said
lily
and
that
reminds
me
said
constance
getting
up
with
great
difficulty
from
her
chair
can
i
find
anything
for
you
lily
asked
no
no
said
constance
leaving
the
room
she
returned
in
a
moment
with
her
a
receptacle
of
ebony
with
ivory
ornamentations
i
always
meant
to
give
you
this
said
constance
taking
from
the
box
a
fine
cameo
brooch
i
do
seem
to
fancy
wearing
it
myself
and
i
should
like
to
see
you
wearing
it
it
was
mother
i
believe
coming
into
fashion
again
i
do
see
why
you
should
wear
it
while
you
in
mourning
they
are
half
so
strict
now
about
mourning
as
they
used
to
be
truly
murmured
lily
ecstatically
they
kissed
constance
seemed
to
breathe
out
benevolence
as
with
trembling
hands
she
pinned
the
brooch
at
lily
neck
she
lavished
the
warm
treasure
of
her
heart
on
lily
whom
she
regarded
as
an
almost
perfect
girl
and
who
had
become
the
idol
of
her
latter
years
what
a
magnificent
old
watch
said
lily
as
they
delved
together
in
the
lower
recesses
of
the
box
and
the
chain
to
it
that
was
father
said
constance
he
always
used
to
swear
by
it
when
it
did
agree
with
the
town
hall
he
used
to
say
th
town
hall
wrong
and
it
curious
the
town
hall
was
wrong
you
know
the
town
hall
clock
has
never
been
a
good
timekeeper
i
been
thinking
of
giving
that
watch
and
chain
to
dick
have
you
said
lily
yes
it
just
as
good
as
it
was
when
father
wore
it
my
husband
never
would
wear
it
he
preferred
his
own
he
had
little
fancies
like
that
and
cyril
takes
after
his
father
she
spoke
in
her
tone
almost
decided
to
give
it
to
dick
that
is
if
he
behaves
himself
is
he
still
on
with
this
ballooning
lily
smiled
guiltily
oh
yes
well
said
constance
i
never
heard
the
like
if
he
been
up
and
come
down
safely
that
ought
to
be
enough
for
him
i
wonder
you
let
him
do
it
my
dear
but
how
can
i
stop
him
i
no
control
over
him
but
do
you
mean
to
say
that
he
still
do
it
if
you
told
him
seriously
you
did
want
him
to
yes
said
lily
and
added
so
i
sha
tell
him
constance
nodded
her
head
musing
over
the
secret
nature
of
men
she
remembered
too
well
the
cruel
obstinacy
of
samuel
who
had
nevertheless
loved
her
and
dick
povey
was
a
thousand
times
more
bizarre
than
samuel
she
saw
him
vividly
a
little
boy
whizzing
down
king
street
on
a
boneshaker
and
his
cap
flying
off
afterwards
it
had
been
now
it
was
balloons
she
sighed
she
was
struck
by
the
profound
instinctive
wisdom
just
enunciated
by
the
girl
well
she
said
i
shall
see
i
not
made
up
my
mind
yet
the
young
man
doing
this
afternoon
by
the
way
he
gone
to
birmingham
to
try
to
sell
two
he
wo
be
back
home
till
late
he
coming
over
here
it
was
an
excellent
illustration
of
dick
povey
methods
that
at
this
very
moment
lily
heard
in
the
square
the
sound
of
a
which
happened
to
be
dick
car
she
sprang
up
to
look
why
she
cried
flushing
here
he
is
now
bless
us
bless
us
muttered
constance
closing
the
box
when
dick
having
left
his
car
in
king
street
limped
tempestuously
into
the
galvanizing
it
by
his
abundant
vitality
into
a
new
life
he
cried
joyously
sold
my
lorries
sold
my
lorries
and
he
explained
that
by
a
charming
accident
he
had
disposed
of
them
to
a
chance
buyer
in
hanbridge
just
before
starting
for
birmingham
so
he
had
telephoned
to
birmingham
that
the
matter
was
and
then
being
a
loose
end
he
had
come
over
to
bursley
in
search
of
his
betrothed
at
holl
shop
they
had
told
him
that
she
was
with
povey
constance
glanced
at
him
impressed
by
his
jolly
air
of
success
he
seemed
exactly
like
his
breezy
and
advertisements
in
the
signal
he
was
absolutely
pleased
with
himself
he
triumphed
over
his
limp
that
reminder
of
a
tragedy
who
would
dream
to
look
at
his
blond
laughing
scintillating
face
astonishingly
young
for
his
years
that
he
had
once
passed
through
such
a
night
as
that
on
which
his
father
had
killed
his
mother
while
he
lay
immovable
and
cursing
with
a
broken
knee
in
bed
constance
had
heard
all
about
that
scene
from
her
husband
and
she
paused
in
wonder
at
the
contrasting
hazards
of
existence
dick
povey
brought
his
hands
together
with
a
resounding
smack
and
then
rubbed
them
rapidly
and
a
good
price
too
he
exclaimed
blithely
povey
i
mind
telling
you
that
i
netted
seventy
pounds
odd
this
afternoon
lily
eyes
expressed
her
proud
joy
i
hope
pride
wo
have
a
fall
said
constance
with
a
calm
smile
out
of
which
peeped
a
hint
of
a
rebuke
that
what
i
hope
i
must
just
go
and
see
about
tea
i
ca
stay
for
tea
really
said
dick
of
course
you
can
said
constance
positively
suppose
you
been
at
birmingham
it
weeks
since
you
stayed
to
tea
oh
well
thanks
dick
yielded
rather
snubbed
ca
i
save
you
a
journey
mrs
povey
lily
asked
eagerly
thoughtful
no
thank
you
my
dear
there
are
one
or
two
little
things
that
need
my
attention
and
constance
departed
with
her
dick
having
assured
himself
that
the
door
was
closed
assaulted
lily
with
a
kiss
been
here
long
he
inquired
about
an
hour
and
a
half
glad
to
see
me
oh
dick
she
protested
old
lady
in
one
of
her
humours
eh
no
no
only
she
was
just
talking
about
balloons
you
know
she
very
much
up
in
arms
you
ought
to
keep
her
off
balloons
balloons
may
be
the
ruin
of
her
to
us
my
child
dick
how
can
you
talk
like
that
it
all
very
well
saying
i
ought
to
keep
her
off
balloons
you
try
to
keep
her
off
balloons
when
once
she
begins
and
see
what
started
her
she
said
she
was
thinking
of
giving
you
old
baines
gold
watch
and
chain
if
you
behaved
yourself
thank
you
for
nothing
said
dick
i
do
want
it
have
you
seen
it
have
i
seen
it
i
should
say
i
had
seen
it
she
mentioned
it
once
or
twice
before
oh
i
did
know
i
do
see
myself
carting
that
thing
about
i
much
prefer
my
own
what
do
you
think
of
it
of
course
it
is
rather
clumsy
said
lily
but
if
she
offered
it
to
you
you
could
refuse
it
and
you
simply
have
to
wear
it
well
then
said
dick
i
must
try
to
behave
myself
just
badly
enough
to
keep
off
the
watch
but
not
badly
enough
to
upset
her
notions
about
poor
old
thing
lily
murmured
compassionately
then
lily
put
her
hand
silently
to
her
neck
what
that
she
just
given
it
to
me
dick
approached
very
near
to
examine
the
cameo
brooch
hm
he
murmured
it
was
an
adverse
verdict
and
lily
coincided
with
it
by
a
lift
of
the
eyebrows
and
i
suppose
you
have
to
wear
that
said
dick
she
values
it
as
much
as
anything
she
got
poor
old
thing
said
lily
it
belonged
to
her
mother
and
she
says
cameos
are
coming
into
fashion
again
it
really
is
rather
good
you
know
i
wonder
where
she
learnt
that
said
dick
drily
i
see
you
been
suffering
from
the
photographs
again
well
said
lily
i
much
prefer
the
photographs
to
helping
her
to
play
patience
the
way
she
cheats
herself
it
too
silly
i
she
stopped
the
door
which
had
after
all
not
been
latched
was
pushed
open
and
the
antique
fossette
introduced
herself
painfully
into
the
room
fossette
had
an
affection
for
dick
povey
well
methusaleh
he
greeted
the
animal
loudly
she
could
scarcely
wag
her
tail
nor
shake
the
hair
out
of
her
dim
eyes
in
order
to
look
up
at
him
he
stooped
to
pat
her
that
dog
does
smell
said
lily
bluntly
what
do
you
expect
what
she
wants
is
the
least
dose
of
prussic
acid
she
a
burden
to
herself
it
funny
that
if
you
venture
to
hint
to
povey
that
the
dog
is
offensive
she
gets
quite
peppery
said
lily
well
that
very
simple
said
dick
do
hint
that
all
hold
your
nose
and
your
tongue
too
dick
i
do
wish
you
would
be
so
absurd
constance
returned
into
the
room
cutting
short
the
conversation
povey
said
dick
in
a
voice
full
of
gratitude
lily
has
just
been
showing
me
her
brooch
he
noticed
that
she
paid
no
heed
to
him
but
passed
hurriedly
to
the
window
what
amiss
in
the
square
constance
exclaimed
when
i
was
in
the
parlour
just
now
i
saw
a
man
running
along
wedgwood
street
and
i
said
to
myself
what
amiss
dick
and
lily
joined
her
at
the
window
several
people
were
hurrying
down
the
square
and
then
a
man
came
running
with
a
doctor
from
the
all
these
persons
disappeared
from
view
under
the
window
of
povey
which
was
over
part
of
critchlow
shop
as
the
windows
of
the
shop
projected
beyond
the
walls
of
the
house
it
was
impossible
from
the
window
to
see
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
shop
it
must
be
something
on
the
pavement
or
in
the
shop
murmured
constance
oh
said
a
startled
voice
behind
the
three
it
was
mary
original
of
the
photograph
who
had
run
unperceived
into
the
they
say
as
critchlow
has
tried
to
commit
suicide
constance
started
back
lily
went
towards
her
with
an
instinctive
gesture
of
supporting
consolation
maria
critchlow
tried
to
commit
suicide
constance
muttered
yes
but
they
say
she
not
done
it
by
jove
i
better
go
and
see
if
i
can
help
had
i
cried
dick
povey
hobbling
off
excited
and
speedy
strange
is
it
he
exclaimed
afterwards
how
i
manage
to
come
in
for
things
sheer
chance
that
i
was
here
but
it
always
like
that
somehow
something
extraordinary
is
always
happening
where
i
am
and
this
too
ministered
to
his
satisfaction
and
to
his
zest
for
life
ii
when
in
the
evening
after
all
sorts
of
comings
and
goings
he
finally
returned
to
the
old
lady
and
the
young
one
in
order
to
report
the
upshot
his
demeanour
was
suitably
toned
to
constance
mood
the
old
lady
had
been
very
deeply
disturbed
by
the
tragedy
which
as
she
said
had
passed
under
her
very
feet
while
she
was
calmly
talking
to
lily
the
whole
truth
came
out
in
a
short
space
of
time
critchlow
was
suffering
from
melancholia
it
appeared
that
for
long
she
had
been
depressed
by
the
failing
trade
of
the
shop
which
was
none
of
her
fault
the
state
of
the
square
had
steadily
deteriorated
even
the
were
not
what
they
once
were
four
or
five
shops
had
been
shut
up
as
it
were
definitely
the
landlords
having
given
up
hope
of
discovering
serious
tenants
and
of
those
kept
open
the
majority
were
struggling
desperately
to
make
ends
meet
only
holl
and
a
new
upstart
draper
who
had
widely
advertised
his
department
were
really
flourishing
the
confectionery
half
of
brindley
business
was
disappearing
people
would
not
go
to
hanbridge
for
their
bread
or
for
their
groceries
but
they
would
go
for
their
cakes
these
electric
trams
had
simply
carried
to
hanbridge
the
cream
and
much
of
the
milk
of
bursley
retail
trade
there
were
unprincipled
tradesmen
in
hanbridge
ready
to
pay
the
of
any
customer
who
spent
a
crown
in
their
establishments
hanbridge
was
the
geographical
centre
of
the
five
towns
and
it
was
alive
to
its
situation
useless
for
bursley
to
compete
if
critchlow
had
been
a
philosopher
if
she
had
known
that
geography
had
always
made
history
she
would
have
given
up
her
enterprise
a
dozen
years
ago
but
critchlow
was
merely
maria
insull
she
had
seen
baines
in
its
magnificent
prime
when
almost
conferred
a
favour
on
customers
in
serving
them
at
the
time
when
she
took
over
the
business
under
the
wing
of
her
husband
it
was
still
a
good
business
but
from
that
instant
the
tide
had
seemed
to
turn
she
had
fought
and
she
kept
on
fighting
stupidly
she
was
not
aware
that
she
was
fighting
against
evolution
not
aware
that
evolution
had
chosen
her
for
one
of
its
victims
she
could
understand
that
all
the
other
shops
in
the
square
should
fail
but
not
that
baines
should
fail
she
was
as
industrious
as
ever
as
good
a
buyer
as
good
a
seller
as
keen
for
novelties
as
economical
as
methodical
and
yet
the
returns
dropped
and
dropped
she
naturally
had
no
sympathy
from
charles
who
now
took
small
interest
even
in
his
own
business
or
what
was
left
of
it
and
who
was
coldly
disgusted
at
the
ultimate
cost
of
his
marriage
charles
gave
her
no
money
that
he
could
avoid
giving
her
the
crisis
had
been
slowly
approaching
for
years
the
assistants
in
the
shop
had
said
nothing
or
had
only
whispered
among
themselves
but
now
that
the
crisis
had
flowered
suddenly
in
an
attempted
they
all
spoke
at
once
and
the
evidences
were
pieced
together
into
a
formidable
proof
of
the
strain
which
critchlow
had
suffered
it
appeared
that
for
many
months
she
had
been
depressed
and
irritable
that
sometimes
she
would
sit
down
in
the
midst
of
work
and
declare
with
every
sign
of
exhaustion
that
she
could
do
no
more
then
with
equal
briskness
she
would
arise
and
force
herself
to
labour
she
did
not
sleep
for
whole
nights
one
assistant
related
how
she
had
complained
of
having
had
no
sleep
whatever
for
four
nights
consecutively
she
had
noises
in
the
ears
and
a
chronic
headache
never
very
plump
she
had
grown
thinner
and
thinner
and
she
was
for
ever
taking
pills
this
information
came
from
charles
manager
she
had
had
several
outrageous
quarrels
with
the
redoubtable
charles
to
the
stupefaction
of
all
who
heard
or
saw
them
critchlow
standing
up
to
her
husband
another
strange
thing
was
that
she
thought
the
bills
of
several
of
the
big
manchester
firms
were
unpaid
when
as
a
fact
they
had
been
paid
even
when
shown
the
receipts
she
would
not
be
convinced
though
she
pretended
to
be
convinced
she
would
recommence
the
next
day
all
this
was
sufficiently
disconcerting
for
female
assistants
in
the
drapery
but
what
could
they
do
then
maria
critchlow
had
gone
a
step
further
she
had
summoned
the
eldest
assistant
to
her
corner
and
had
informed
her
with
all
the
solemnity
of
a
confession
made
to
assuage
a
conscience
which
has
been
tortured
too
long
that
she
had
on
many
occasions
been
guilty
of
sexual
irregularity
with
her
late
employer
samuel
povey
there
was
no
truth
whatever
in
this
accusation
which
everybody
however
took
care
not
to
mention
to
constance
it
merely
indicated
perhaps
the
secret
aspirations
of
maria
insull
the
virgin
the
assistant
was
properly
scandalized
more
by
the
crudity
of
critchlow
language
than
by
the
alleged
sin
buried
in
the
past
goodness
knows
what
the
assistant
would
have
done
but
two
hours
later
maria
critchlow
tried
to
commit
suicide
by
stabbing
herself
with
a
pair
of
scissors
there
was
blood
in
the
shop
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
she
had
been
driven
away
to
the
asylum
charles
critchlow
enveloped
safely
in
the
armour
of
his
senile
egotism
had
shown
no
emotion
and
very
little
activity
the
shop
was
closed
and
as
a
general
draper
it
never
opened
again
that
was
the
end
of
baines
two
assistants
found
themselves
without
a
livelihood
the
small
tumble
with
the
great
constance
emotion
was
more
than
pardonable
it
was
justified
she
could
not
eat
and
lily
could
not
persuade
her
to
eat
in
an
unhappy
moment
dick
povey
mentioned
he
never
could
remember
how
afterwards
the
word
federation
and
then
constance
from
a
passive
figure
of
grief
became
a
menace
she
overwhelmed
dick
povey
with
her
anathema
of
federation
for
dick
was
a
citizen
of
hanbridge
where
this
detestable
movement
for
federation
had
had
its
birth
all
the
misfortunes
of
luke
square
were
due
to
that
great
busy
grasping
unscrupulous
neighbour
had
not
hanbridge
done
enough
without
wanting
to
merge
all
the
five
towns
into
one
town
of
which
of
course
itself
would
be
the
centre
for
constance
hanbridge
was
a
borough
of
unprincipled
adventurers
bent
on
ruining
the
ancient
of
the
five
towns
for
its
own
glory
and
aggrandizement
let
constance
hear
no
more
of
federation
her
poor
sister
sophia
had
been
dead
against
federation
and
she
had
been
quite
right
all
really
respectable
people
were
against
it
the
attempted
suicide
of
critchlow
sealed
the
fate
of
federation
and
damned
it
for
ever
in
constance
mind
her
hatred
of
the
idea
of
it
was
intensified
into
violent
animosity
insomuch
that
in
the
result
she
died
a
martyr
to
the
cause
of
bursley
municipal
independence
iii
it
was
on
a
muddy
day
in
october
that
the
first
great
battle
for
and
against
federation
was
fought
in
bursley
constance
was
suffering
severely
from
sciatica
she
was
also
suffering
from
disgust
with
the
modern
world
unimaginable
things
had
happened
in
the
square
for
constance
the
reputation
of
the
square
was
eternally
ruined
charles
critchlow
by
that
strange
good
fortune
which
always
put
him
in
the
right
when
fairly
he
ought
to
have
been
in
the
wrong
had
let
the
baines
shop
and
his
own
shop
and
house
to
the
midland
clothiers
company
which
was
establishing
branches
throughout
staffordshire
warwickshire
leicestershire
and
adjacent
counties
he
had
sold
his
own
chemist
stock
and
gone
to
live
in
a
little
house
at
the
bottom
of
kingstreet
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
would
have
consented
to
retire
had
not
alderman
holl
died
earlier
in
the
year
thus
ending
a
long
rivalry
between
the
old
men
for
the
patriarchate
of
the
square
charles
critchlow
was
as
free
from
sentiment
as
any
man
but
no
man
is
quite
free
from
it
and
the
ancient
was
in
a
position
to
indulge
sentiment
had
he
chosen
his
business
was
not
a
source
of
loss
and
he
could
still
trust
his
skinny
hands
and
peering
eyes
to
make
up
a
prescription
however
the
offer
of
the
midland
clothiers
company
tempted
him
and
as
the
undisputed
of
the
square
he
left
the
square
in
triumph
the
midland
clothiers
company
had
no
sense
of
the
proprieties
of
trade
their
sole
idea
was
to
sell
goods
having
possessed
themselves
of
one
of
the
finest
sites
in
a
town
which
after
all
was
said
and
done
comprised
nearly
forty
thousand
inhabitants
they
set
about
to
make
the
best
of
that
site
they
threw
the
two
shops
into
one
and
they
caused
to
be
constructed
a
sign
compared
to
which
the
spacious
old
sign
was
a
postcard
they
covered
the
entire
frontage
with
posters
of
a
theatrical
description
coloured
posters
they
occupied
the
front
page
of
the
signal
and
from
that
pulpit
they
announced
that
winter
was
approaching
and
that
they
meant
to
sell
ten
thousand
overcoats
at
their
new
shop
in
bursley
at
the
price
of
twelve
and
sixpence
each
the
tailoring
of
the
world
was
loudly
and
coarsely
defied
to
equal
the
value
of
those
overcoats
on
the
day
of
opening
they
arranged
an
orchestra
or
artillery
of
phonographs
upon
the
leads
over
the
window
of
that
part
of
the
shop
which
had
been
critchlow
they
also
carpeted
the
square
with
handbills
and
flew
flags
from
their
upper
storeys
the
immense
shop
proved
to
be
full
of
overcoats
overcoats
were
shown
in
all
the
three
great
windows
in
one
window
an
overcoat
was
disposed
as
a
receptacle
for
water
to
prove
that
the
midland
overcoats
were
impermeable
by
rain
overcoats
flapped
in
the
two
doorways
these
devices
woke
and
drew
the
town
and
the
town
found
itself
received
by
bustling
male
assistants
very
energetic
and
rapid
instead
of
by
demure
anaemic
virgins
at
moments
towards
evening
the
shop
was
populous
with
custom
the
number
of
overcoats
sold
was
prodigious
on
another
day
the
midland
sold
trousers
in
a
like
manner
but
without
the
phonographs
unmistakably
the
midland
had
shaken
the
square
and
demonstrated
that
commerce
was
still
possible
to
fearless
enterprise
nevertheless
the
square
was
not
pleased
the
square
was
conscious
of
shame
of
dignity
departed
constance
was
divided
between
pain
and
scornful
wrath
for
her
what
the
midland
had
done
was
to
desecrate
a
shrine
she
hated
those
flags
and
those
flaring
staring
posters
on
the
honest
old
brick
walls
and
the
enormous
gilded
sign
and
the
windows
all
filled
with
a
monotonous
repetition
of
the
same
article
and
the
bustling
assistants
as
for
the
phonographs
she
regarded
them
as
a
grave
insult
they
had
been
within
twenty
feet
of
her
window
overcoats
it
was
monstrous
and
equally
monstrous
was
the
gullibility
of
the
people
how
could
an
overcoat
at
twelve
and
sixpence
be
she
remembered
the
overcoats
made
and
sold
in
the
shop
in
the
time
of
her
father
and
her
husband
overcoats
of
which
the
inconvenience
was
that
they
would
not
wear
out
the
midland
for
constance
was
not
a
trading
concern
but
something
between
a
and
a
circus
she
could
scarcely
bear
to
walk
down
the
square
to
such
a
degree
did
the
ignoble
frontage
of
the
midland
offend
her
eye
and
outrage
her
ancestral
pride
she
even
said
that
she
would
give
up
her
house
but
when
on
the
of
september
she
received
six
notice
signed
in
critchlow
shaky
hand
to
quit
the
house
it
was
wanted
for
the
midland
manager
the
midland
having
taken
the
premises
on
condition
that
they
might
eject
constance
if
they
chose
the
blow
was
an
exceedingly
severe
one
she
had
sworn
to
go
but
to
be
turned
out
to
be
turned
out
of
the
house
of
her
birth
and
out
of
her
home
that
was
different
her
pride
injured
as
it
was
had
a
great
deal
to
support
it
became
necessary
for
her
to
recollect
that
she
was
a
baines
she
affected
magnificently
not
to
care
but
she
could
not
refrain
from
telling
all
her
acquaintances
that
she
was
being
turned
out
of
her
house
and
asking
them
what
they
thought
of
that
and
when
she
met
charles
critchlow
in
the
street
she
seared
him
with
the
heat
of
her
resentment
the
enterprise
of
finding
a
new
house
and
moving
into
it
loomed
before
her
gigantic
terrible
the
idea
of
it
was
alone
sufficient
to
make
her
ill
meanwhile
in
the
matter
of
federation
preparations
for
the
pitched
battle
had
been
going
forward
especially
in
the
columns
of
the
signal
where
the
scribes
of
each
one
of
the
five
towns
had
proved
that
all
the
other
towns
were
in
the
clutch
of
unscrupulous
gangs
of
after
months
of
argument
and
recrimination
all
the
towns
except
bursley
were
either
favourable
or
indifferent
to
the
prospect
of
becoming
a
part
of
the
twelfth
largest
town
in
the
united
kingdom
but
in
bursley
the
opposition
was
strong
and
the
twelfth
largest
town
in
the
united
kingdom
could
not
spring
into
existence
without
the
consent
of
bursley
the
united
kingdom
itself
was
languidly
interested
in
the
possibility
of
suddenly
being
endowed
with
a
new
town
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
inhabitants
the
five
towns
were
frequently
mentioned
in
the
london
dailies
and
london
journalists
would
write
such
sentences
as
the
five
towns
which
are
of
course
as
everybody
knows
hanbridge
bursley
knype
longshaw
and
turnhill
this
was
renown
at
last
for
the
most
maligned
district
in
the
country
and
then
a
cabinet
minister
had
visited
the
five
towns
and
assisted
at
an
official
inquiry
and
stated
in
his
hammering
style
that
he
meant
personally
to
do
everything
possible
to
accomplish
the
federation
of
the
five
towns
an
incautious
remark
which
infuriated
while
it
flattered
the
opponents
of
federation
in
bursley
constance
with
many
other
sensitive
persons
asked
angrily
what
right
a
cabinet
minister
had
to
take
sides
in
a
purely
local
affair
but
the
partiality
of
the
official
world
grew
flagrant
the
mayor
of
bursley
openly
proclaimed
himself
a
federationist
though
there
was
a
majority
on
the
council
against
him
even
ministers
of
religion
permitted
themselves
to
think
and
to
express
opinions
well
might
the
indignant
old
guard
imagine
that
the
end
of
public
decency
had
come
the
federationists
were
very
ingenious
individuals
they
contrived
to
enrol
in
their
ranks
a
vast
number
of
leading
men
then
they
hired
the
covered
market
and
put
a
platform
in
it
and
put
all
these
leading
men
on
the
platform
and
made
them
all
speak
eloquently
on
the
advantages
of
moving
with
the
times
the
meeting
was
crowded
and
enthusiastic
and
readers
of
the
signal
next
day
could
not
but
see
that
the
battle
was
won
in
advance
and
that
was
dead
in
the
following
week
however
the
held
in
the
covered
market
an
exactly
similar
meeting
except
that
the
display
of
leading
men
was
less
brilliant
and
demanded
of
a
floor
of
serried
heads
whether
the
old
mother
of
the
five
towns
was
prepared
to
put
herself
into
the
hands
of
a
crew
of
bureaucrats
at
hanbridge
and
was
answered
by
a
wild
defiant
no
that
could
be
heard
on
duck
bank
readers
of
the
signal
next
day
were
fain
to
see
that
the
battle
had
not
been
won
in
advance
bursley
was
lukewarm
on
the
topics
of
education
slums
water
gas
electricity
but
it
meant
to
fight
for
that
mysterious
thing
its
identity
was
the
name
of
bursley
to
be
lost
to
the
world
to
ask
the
question
was
to
give
the
answer
then
dawned
the
day
of
battle
the
day
of
the
poll
when
the
burgesses
were
to
indicate
plainly
by
means
of
a
cross
on
a
voting
paper
whether
or
not
they
wanted
federation
and
on
this
day
constance
was
almost
incapacitated
by
sciatica
it
was
a
heroic
day
the
walls
of
the
town
were
covered
with
literature
and
the
streets
dotted
with
and
other
vehicles
at
the
service
of
the
voters
the
greater
number
of
these
vehicles
bore
large
cards
with
the
words
federation
this
time
and
hundreds
of
men
walked
briskly
about
with
circular
cards
tied
to
their
lapels
as
though
bursley
had
been
a
and
these
cards
too
had
the
words
federation
this
time
the
reference
was
to
a
light
poll
which
had
been
taken
several
years
before
when
no
interest
had
been
aroused
and
the
immature
project
yet
defeated
by
a
six
to
one
majority
all
partisans
of
federation
sported
a
red
ribbon
all
sported
a
blue
ribbon
the
schools
were
closed
and
the
federationists
displayed
their
characteristic
lack
of
scruple
in
appropriating
the
children
the
federationists
with
devilish
skill
had
hired
the
bursley
town
silver
prize
band
an
organization
of
terrific
respectability
and
had
set
it
to
march
playing
through
the
town
followed
by
wagonettes
crammed
with
children
who
sang
vote
vote
vote
for
federation
do
be
stupid
old
and
slow
we
are
sure
that
it
will
be
good
for
the
communitie
so
vote
vote
vote
and
make
it
go
how
this
performance
could
affect
the
decision
of
grave
burgesses
at
the
polls
was
not
apparent
but
the
feared
that
it
might
and
before
noon
was
come
they
had
engaged
two
bands
and
had
composed
in
committee
the
following
lyric
in
reply
to
the
first
one
down
down
down
with
federation
as
we
are
we
rather
stay
when
the
vote
on
saturday
read
federation
will
be
dead
good
old
sure
to
win
the
day
they
had
also
composed
another
song
entitled
dear
old
bursley
which
however
they
made
the
fatal
error
of
setting
to
the
music
of
auld
lang
syne
the
effect
was
that
of
a
dirge
and
it
perhaps
influenced
many
voters
in
favour
of
the
more
cheerful
party
the
indeed
never
regained
the
mean
advantage
filched
by
unscrupulous
federationists
with
the
help
of
the
silver
prize
band
and
a
few
hundred
infants
the
odds
were
against
the
the
mayor
had
actually
issued
a
letter
to
the
inhabitants
accusing
the
of
unfair
methods
this
was
really
too
much
the
impudence
of
it
knocked
the
breath
out
of
its
victims
and
breath
is
very
necessary
in
a
polling
contest
the
federationists
as
one
of
their
prominent
opponents
admitted
it
all
their
own
way
dominating
both
the
streets
and
the
walls
and
when
early
in
the
afternoon
dick
povey
sailed
over
the
town
in
a
balloon
that
was
plainly
decorated
with
the
crimson
of
federation
it
was
felt
that
the
cause
of
bursley
separate
identity
was
for
ever
lost
still
bursley
with
the
willing
aid
of
the
maintained
its
gaiety
iv
towards
dusk
a
stout
old
lady
with
grey
hair
and
a
dowdy
bonnet
and
an
expensive
mantle
passed
limping
very
slowly
along
wedgwood
street
and
up
the
cock
yard
towards
the
town
hall
her
wrinkled
face
had
an
anxious
look
but
it
was
also
very
determined
the
busy
joyous
federationists
and
who
knew
her
not
saw
merely
a
stout
old
lady
fussing
forth
and
those
who
knew
her
saw
merely
povey
and
greeted
her
perfunctorily
a
woman
of
her
age
and
gait
being
rather
out
of
place
in
that
feverish
altercation
of
opposed
principles
but
it
was
more
than
a
stout
old
lady
it
was
more
than
povey
that
waddled
with
such
painful
deliberation
through
the
streets
it
was
a
miracle
in
the
morning
constance
had
been
partially
incapacitated
by
her
sciatica
so
much
so
at
any
rate
that
she
had
perceived
the
advisability
of
remaining
on
the
bedroom
floor
instead
of
descending
to
the
parlour
therefore
mary
had
lighted
the
fire
and
constance
had
ensconced
herself
by
it
with
fossette
in
a
basket
lily
holl
had
called
early
and
had
been
very
sympathetic
but
rather
vague
the
truth
was
that
she
was
concealing
the
imminent
balloon
ascent
which
dick
povey
with
his
instinct
for
the
picturesque
had
somehow
arranged
in
conjunction
with
a
manchester
aeronaut
for
the
very
day
of
the
poll
that
was
one
of
various
matters
that
had
to
be
from
the
old
lady
lily
herself
was
much
perturbed
about
the
balloon
ascent
she
had
to
run
off
and
see
dick
before
he
started
at
the
football
ground
at
bleakridge
and
then
she
had
to
live
through
the
hours
till
she
should
receive
a
telegram
to
the
effect
that
dick
had
come
down
safely
or
that
dick
had
broken
his
leg
in
coming
down
or
that
dick
was
dead
it
was
a
trying
time
for
lily
she
had
left
constance
after
a
brief
visit
with
a
preoccupied
unusual
air
saying
that
as
the
day
was
a
special
day
she
should
come
in
again
she
could
and
she
did
not
forget
to
assure
constance
that
federation
would
beyond
any
question
whatever
be
handsomely
beaten
at
the
poll
for
this
was
another
matter
as
to
which
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
keep
the
old
lady
the
dark
lest
the
foolish
old
lady
should
worry
and
commit
indiscretions
after
that
constance
had
been
forgotten
by
the
world
of
bursley
which
could
pay
small
heed
to
sciatical
old
ladies
confined
to
sofas
and
firesides
she
was
in
acute
pain
as
mary
could
see
when
at
intervals
she
hovered
round
her
assuredly
it
was
one
of
constance
bad
days
one
of
those
days
on
which
she
felt
that
the
tide
of
life
had
left
her
stranded
in
utter
neglect
the
sound
of
the
bursley
town
silver
prize
band
aroused
her
from
her
mournful
trance
of
suffering
then
the
high
treble
of
children
voices
startled
her
she
defied
her
sciatica
and
grimacing
went
to
the
window
and
at
the
first
glimpse
she
could
see
that
the
federation
poll
was
going
to
be
a
much
more
exciting
affair
than
she
had
imagined
the
great
cards
swinging
from
the
wagonettes
showed
her
that
federation
was
at
all
events
still
sufficiently
alive
to
make
a
formidable
impression
on
the
eye
and
the
ear
the
square
was
transformed
by
this
clamour
in
favour
of
federation
people
cheered
and
sang
also
as
the
procession
wound
down
the
square
and
she
could
distinctly
catch
the
tramping
martial
syllables
vote
vote
vote
she
was
indignant
the
pother
once
begun
continued
vehicles
flashed
frequently
across
the
square
most
of
them
in
the
crimson
livery
little
knots
and
processions
of
excited
wayfarers
were
a
recurring
feature
of
the
unaccustomed
traffic
and
the
large
majority
of
them
flaunted
the
colours
of
federation
mary
after
some
errands
of
shopping
came
upstairs
and
reported
that
was
simply
federation
everywhere
and
that
brindley
a
strong
federationist
was
a
bit
above
himself
further
that
the
interest
in
the
poll
was
tremendous
and
universal
she
said
there
were
and
crowds
round
the
town
hall
even
mary
generally
a
little
placid
and
dull
had
caught
something
of
the
contagious
vivacity
constance
remained
at
the
window
till
dinner
and
after
dinner
she
went
to
it
again
it
was
fortunate
that
she
did
not
think
of
looking
up
into
the
sky
when
dick
balloon
sailed
westwards
she
would
have
guessed
instantly
that
dick
was
in
that
balloon
and
her
grievances
would
have
been
multiplied
the
vast
grievance
of
the
federation
scheme
weighed
on
her
to
the
extremity
of
her
power
to
bear
she
was
not
a
politician
she
had
no
general
ideas
she
did
not
see
the
cosmic
movement
in
large
curves
she
was
incapable
of
perceiving
the
absurdity
involved
in
perpetuating
municipal
divisions
which
the
growth
of
the
district
had
rendered
artificial
vexatious
and
harmful
she
saw
nothing
but
bursley
and
in
bursley
nothing
but
the
square
she
knew
nothing
except
that
the
people
of
bursley
who
once
shopped
in
bursley
now
shopped
in
hanbridge
and
that
the
square
was
a
desert
infested
by
and
there
were
actually
people
who
wished
to
bow
the
neck
to
hanbridge
who
were
ready
to
sacrifice
the
very
name
of
bursley
to
the
greedy
humour
of
that
pushing
chicago
she
could
not
understand
such
people
did
they
know
that
poor
maria
critchlow
was
in
a
lunatic
asylum
because
hanbridge
was
so
grasping
ah
poor
maria
was
forgotten
did
they
know
that
as
a
further
indirect
consequence
she
the
daughter
of
bursley
chief
tradesman
was
to
be
thrown
out
of
the
house
in
which
she
was
born
she
wished
bitterly
as
she
stood
there
at
the
window
watching
the
triumph
of
federation
that
she
had
bought
the
house
and
shop
at
the
mericarp
sale
years
ago
she
would
have
shown
them
as
owner
what
was
what
she
forgot
that
the
property
which
she
already
owned
in
bursley
was
a
continual
annoyance
to
her
and
that
she
was
always
resolving
to
sell
it
at
no
matter
what
loss
she
said
to
herself
that
she
had
a
vote
and
that
if
she
had
been
all
fit
to
stir
out
she
would
certainly
have
voted
she
said
to
herself
that
it
had
been
her
duty
to
vote
and
then
by
an
illusion
of
her
wrought
nerves
tightened
minute
by
minute
throughout
the
day
she
began
to
fancy
that
her
sciatica
was
easier
she
said
if
only
i
could
go
out
she
might
have
a
cab
of
any
of
the
parading
vehicles
would
be
glad
to
take
her
to
the
town
hall
and
perhaps
as
a
favour
to
bring
her
back
again
but
no
she
dared
not
go
out
she
was
afraid
really
afraid
that
even
the
mild
mary
might
stop
her
otherwise
she
could
have
sent
mary
for
a
cab
and
supposing
that
lily
returned
and
caught
her
going
out
or
coming
in
she
ought
not
to
go
out
yet
her
sciatica
was
strangely
better
it
was
folly
to
think
of
going
out
yet
and
lily
did
not
come
she
was
rather
hurt
that
lily
had
not
paid
her
a
second
visit
lily
was
neglecting
her
she
would
go
out
it
was
not
four
minutes
walk
for
her
to
the
town
hall
and
she
was
better
and
there
had
been
no
shower
for
a
long
time
and
the
wind
was
drying
the
mud
in
the
roadways
yes
she
would
go
like
a
thief
she
passed
into
her
bedroom
and
put
on
her
things
and
like
a
thief
she
crept
downstairs
and
so
without
a
word
to
mary
into
the
street
it
was
a
desperate
adventure
as
soon
as
she
was
in
the
street
she
felt
all
her
weakness
all
the
fatigue
which
the
effort
had
already
cost
her
the
pain
returned
the
streets
were
still
wet
and
foul
the
wind
cold
and
the
sky
menacing
she
ought
to
go
back
she
ought
to
admit
that
she
had
been
a
fool
to
dream
of
the
enterprise
the
town
hall
seemed
to
be
miles
off
at
the
top
of
a
mountain
she
went
forward
however
steeled
to
do
her
share
in
the
killing
of
federation
every
step
caused
her
a
gnashing
of
her
old
teeth
she
chose
the
cock
yard
route
because
if
she
had
gone
up
the
square
she
would
have
had
to
pass
holl
shop
and
lily
might
have
spied
her
this
was
the
miracle
that
breezy
politicians
witnessed
without
being
aware
that
it
was
a
miracle
to
have
impressed
them
constance
ought
to
have
fainted
before
recording
her
vote
and
made
herself
the
centre
of
a
crowd
of
gapers
but
she
managed
somehow
to
reach
home
again
on
her
own
tortured
feet
and
an
astounded
and
protesting
mary
opened
the
door
to
her
rain
was
descending
she
was
frightened
then
by
the
hardihood
of
her
adventure
and
by
its
atrocious
results
on
her
body
an
appalling
exhaustion
rendered
her
helpless
but
the
deed
was
done
v
the
next
morning
after
a
night
which
she
could
not
have
described
constance
found
herself
lying
flat
in
bed
with
all
her
limbs
stretched
out
straight
she
was
conscious
that
her
face
was
covered
with
perspiration
the
hung
within
a
foot
of
her
head
but
she
had
decided
that
rather
than
move
in
order
to
pull
it
she
would
prefer
to
wait
for
assistance
until
mary
came
of
her
own
accord
her
experiences
of
the
night
had
given
her
a
dread
of
the
slightest
movement
anything
was
better
than
movement
she
felt
vaguely
ill
with
a
kind
of
subdued
pain
and
she
was
very
thirsty
and
somewhat
cold
she
knew
that
her
left
arm
and
leg
were
extraordinarily
tender
to
the
touch
when
mary
at
length
entered
clean
and
fresh
and
pale
in
all
her
mildness
she
found
the
mistress
the
colour
of
a
duck
egg
with
puffed
features
and
a
strangely
anxious
expression
mary
said
constance
i
feel
so
queer
perhaps
you
better
run
up
and
tell
miss
holl
and
ask
her
to
telephone
for
dr
stirling
this
was
the
beginning
of
constance
last
illness
mary
most
impressively
informed
miss
holl
that
her
mistress
had
been
out
on
the
previous
afternoon
in
spite
of
her
sciatica
and
lily
telephoned
the
fact
to
the
doctor
lily
then
came
down
to
take
charge
of
constance
but
she
dared
not
upbraid
the
invalid
is
the
result
out
constance
murmured
oh
yes
said
lily
lightly
there
a
majority
of
over
twelve
hundred
against
federation
great
excitement
last
night
i
told
you
yesterday
morning
that
federation
was
bound
to
be
beaten
lily
spoke
as
though
the
result
throughout
had
been
a
certainty
her
tone
to
constance
indicated
surely
you
do
imagine
that
i
should
have
told
you
untruths
yesterday
morning
merely
to
cheer
you
up
the
truth
was
however
that
towards
the
end
of
the
day
nearly
every
one
had
believed
federation
to
be
carried
the
result
had
caused
great
surprise
only
the
profoundest
philosophers
had
not
been
surprised
to
see
that
the
mere
blind
deaf
inert
forces
of
reaction
with
faulty
organization
and
quite
deprived
of
the
aid
of
logic
had
proved
far
stronger
than
all
the
alert
enthusiasm
arrayed
against
them
it
was
a
notable
lesson
to
reformers
oh
murmured
constance
startled
she
was
relieved
but
she
would
have
liked
the
majority
to
be
smaller
moreover
her
interest
in
the
question
had
lessened
it
was
her
limbs
that
her
now
you
look
tired
she
said
feebly
to
lily
do
i
said
lily
shortly
hiding
the
fact
that
she
had
spent
half
the
night
in
tending
dick
povey
who
in
a
sensational
descent
near
macclesfield
had
been
dragged
through
the
tops
of
a
row
of
elm
trees
to
the
detriment
of
an
the
professional
aeronaut
had
broken
a
leg
then
stirling
came
i
afraid
my
sciatica
worse
doctor
said
constance
apologetically
did
you
expect
it
to
be
better
said
he
gazing
at
her
sternly
she
knew
then
that
some
one
had
saved
her
the
trouble
of
confessing
her
escapade
however
her
sciatica
was
not
worse
her
sciatica
had
not
behaved
basely
what
she
was
suffering
from
was
the
preliminary
advances
of
an
attack
of
acute
rheumatism
she
had
indeed
selected
the
right
month
and
weather
for
her
escapade
fatigued
by
pain
by
nervous
agitation
and
by
the
immense
moral
and
physical
effort
needed
to
carry
her
to
the
town
hall
and
back
she
had
caught
a
chill
and
had
got
her
feet
damp
in
such
a
subject
as
herself
it
was
enough
the
doctor
used
only
the
phrase
rheumatism
constance
did
not
know
that
acute
rheumatism
was
precisely
the
same
thing
as
that
dread
disease
rheumatic
fever
and
she
was
not
informed
she
did
not
surmise
for
a
considerable
period
that
her
case
was
desperately
serious
the
doctor
explained
the
summoning
of
two
nurses
and
the
frequency
of
his
own
visits
by
saying
that
his
chief
anxiety
was
to
minimise
the
fearful
pain
as
much
as
possible
and
that
this
end
could
only
be
secured
by
incessant
watchfulness
the
pain
was
certainly
formidable
but
then
constance
was
well
habituated
to
formidable
pain
sciatica
at
its
most
active
can
not
be
surpassed
even
by
rheumatic
fever
constance
had
been
in
nearly
continuous
pain
for
years
her
friends
however
sympathetic
could
not
appreciate
the
intensity
of
her
torture
they
were
just
as
used
to
it
as
she
was
and
the
monotony
and
particularity
of
her
complaints
slight
though
the
complaints
were
in
comparison
with
their
cause
necessarily
blunted
the
edge
of
compassion
povey
and
her
sciatica
again
poor
thing
she
really
is
a
little
tedious
they
were
apt
not
to
realise
that
sciatica
is
even
more
tedious
than
complaints
about
sciatica
she
asked
one
day
that
dick
should
come
to
see
her
he
came
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
and
told
her
charily
that
he
had
hurt
his
elbow
through
dropping
his
stick
and
slipping
downstairs
lily
never
told
me
said
constance
suspiciously
oh
it
simply
nothing
said
dick
not
even
the
sick
room
could
chasten
him
of
his
joy
in
the
magnificent
balloon
adventure
i
do
hope
you
wo
go
running
any
risks
said
constance
never
you
fear
said
he
i
shall
die
in
my
bed
and
he
was
absolutely
convinced
that
he
would
and
not
as
the
result
of
any
accident
either
the
nurse
would
not
allow
him
to
remain
in
the
room
lily
suggested
that
constance
might
like
her
to
write
to
cyril
it
was
only
in
order
to
make
sure
of
cyril
correct
address
he
had
gone
on
a
tour
through
italy
with
some
friends
of
whom
constance
knew
nothing
the
address
appeared
to
be
very
uncertain
there
were
several
addresses
poste
restante
in
various
towns
cyril
had
sent
postcards
to
his
mother
dick
and
lily
went
to
the
and
telegraphed
to
foreign
parts
though
constance
was
too
ill
to
know
how
ill
she
was
though
she
had
no
conception
of
the
domestic
confusion
caused
by
her
illness
her
brain
was
often
remarkably
clear
and
she
could
reflect
in
long
sane
meditations
above
the
uneasy
sea
of
her
pain
in
the
earlier
hours
of
the
night
after
the
nurses
had
been
changed
and
mary
had
gone
to
bed
exhausted
with
and
lily
holl
was
recounting
the
day
to
dick
up
at
the
grocer
and
the
was
already
asleep
and
the
had
arranged
the
night
then
in
the
silence
of
the
chamber
constance
would
argue
with
herself
for
an
hour
at
a
time
she
frequently
thought
of
sophia
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
sophia
was
dead
she
still
pitied
sophia
as
a
woman
whose
life
had
been
wasted
this
idea
of
sophia
wasted
and
sterile
life
and
of
the
importance
of
adhering
to
principles
recurred
to
her
again
and
again
why
did
she
run
away
with
him
if
only
she
had
not
run
away
she
would
repeat
and
yet
there
had
been
something
so
fine
about
sophia
which
made
sophia
case
all
the
more
pitiable
constance
never
pitied
herself
she
did
not
consider
that
fate
had
treated
her
very
badly
she
was
not
very
discontented
with
herself
the
invincible
commonsense
of
a
sound
nature
prevented
her
in
her
best
moments
from
feebly
dissolving
in
she
had
lived
in
honesty
and
kindliness
for
a
fair
number
of
years
and
she
had
tasted
triumphant
hours
she
was
justly
respected
she
had
a
position
she
had
dignity
she
was
she
possessed
after
all
a
certain
amount
of
quiet
there
existed
nobody
to
whom
she
would
down
or
could
be
asked
to
down
true
she
was
old
so
were
thousands
of
other
people
in
bursley
she
was
in
pain
so
there
were
thousands
of
other
people
with
whom
would
she
be
willing
to
exchange
lots
she
had
many
dissatisfactions
but
she
rose
superior
to
them
when
she
surveyed
her
life
and
life
in
general
she
would
think
with
a
sort
of
tart
but
not
sour
cheerfulness
well
that
is
what
life
is
despite
her
habit
of
complaining
about
domestic
trifles
she
was
in
the
essence
of
her
character
great
body
for
making
the
best
of
things
thus
she
did
not
unduly
bewail
her
excursion
to
the
town
hall
to
vote
which
the
sequel
had
proved
to
be
ludicrously
supererogatory
how
was
i
to
know
she
said
the
one
matter
in
which
she
had
gravely
to
reproach
herself
was
her
indulgent
spoiling
of
cyril
after
the
death
of
samuel
povey
but
the
end
of
her
reproaches
always
was
i
expect
i
should
do
the
same
again
and
probably
it
would
have
made
any
difference
if
i
had
spoiled
him
and
she
had
paid
tenfold
for
the
weakness
she
loved
cyril
but
she
had
no
illusions
about
him
she
saw
both
sides
of
him
she
remembered
all
the
sadness
and
all
the
humiliations
which
he
had
caused
her
still
her
affection
was
unimpaired
a
son
might
be
worse
than
cyril
was
he
had
admirable
qualities
she
did
not
resent
his
being
away
from
england
while
she
lay
if
it
was
serious
she
said
he
would
not
lose
a
moment
and
lily
and
dick
were
a
treasure
to
her
in
those
two
she
really
had
been
lucky
she
took
great
pleasure
in
contemplating
the
splendour
of
the
gift
with
which
she
would
mark
her
appreciation
of
them
at
their
approaching
wedding
the
secret
attitude
of
both
of
them
towards
her
was
one
of
condescension
expressed
in
the
tone
in
which
they
would
say
to
each
other
old
lady
perhaps
they
would
have
been
startled
to
know
that
constance
lovingly
looked
down
on
both
of
them
she
had
unbounded
admiration
for
their
hearts
but
she
thought
that
dick
was
a
little
too
brusque
a
little
too
clownish
to
be
quite
a
gentleman
and
though
lily
was
perfectly
ladylike
in
constance
opinion
she
lacked
backbone
or
grit
or
independence
of
spirit
further
constance
considered
that
the
disparity
of
age
between
them
was
excessive
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
when
all
was
said
constance
had
such
a
very
great
deal
to
learn
from
the
wisdom
of
these
young
things
after
a
period
of
she
would
sometimes
fall
into
a
shallow
delirium
in
all
her
delirium
she
was
invariably
wandering
to
and
fro
lost
in
the
long
underground
passage
leading
from
the
scullery
past
the
and
the
to
the
backyard
and
she
was
afraid
of
the
of
those
regions
as
she
had
been
in
her
infancy
it
was
not
acute
rheumatism
but
a
supervening
pericarditis
that
in
a
few
days
killed
her
she
died
in
the
night
alone
with
the
by
a
curious
chance
the
wesleyan
minister
hearing
that
she
was
seriously
ill
had
called
on
the
previous
day
she
had
not
asked
for
him
and
this
pastoral
visit
from
a
man
who
had
always
said
that
the
heavy
duties
of
the
circuit
rendered
pastoral
visits
almost
impossible
made
her
think
in
the
evening
she
had
requested
that
fossette
should
be
brought
upstairs
thus
she
was
turned
out
of
her
house
but
not
by
the
midland
clothiers
company
old
people
said
to
one
another
have
you
heard
that
povey
is
dead
eh
dear
me
there
be
no
one
left
soon
these
old
people
were
bad
prophets
her
friends
genuinely
regretted
her
and
forgot
the
tediousness
of
her
sciatica
they
tried
in
their
sympathetic
grief
to
picture
to
themselves
all
that
she
had
been
through
in
her
life
possibly
they
imagined
that
they
succeeded
in
this
imaginative
attempt
but
they
did
not
succeed
no
one
but
constance
could
realize
all
that
constance
had
been
through
and
all
that
life
had
meant
to
her
cyril
was
not
at
the
funeral
he
arrived
three
days
later
as
he
had
no
interest
in
the
love
affairs
of
dick
and
lily
the
couple
were
robbed
of
their
the
will
fifteen
years
old
was
in
cyril
favour
but
the
immortal
charles
critchlow
came
to
the
funeral
full
of
calm
sardonic
glee
and
without
being
asked
though
fabulously
senile
he
had
preserved
and
even
improved
his
faculty
for
enjoying
a
catastrophe
he
now
went
to
funerals
with
gusto
contentedly
absorbed
in
the
task
of
burying
his
friends
one
by
one
it
was
he
who
said
in
his
high
trembling
rasping
deliberate
voice
it
a
pity
her
did
live
long
enough
to
hear
as
federation
is
going
on
after
all
that
would
ha
worritted
her
for
the
unscrupulous
advocates
of
federation
had
discovered
a
method
of
setting
at
naught
the
decisive
result
of
the
referendum
and
that
day
signal
was
fuller
than
ever
of
federation
when
the
short
funeral
procession
started
mary
and
the
infirm
fossette
sole
relic
of
the
connection
between
the
baines
family
and
paris
were
left
alone
in
the
house
the
tearful
servant
prepared
the
dog
dinner
and
laid
it
before
her
in
the
customary
in
the
customary
corner
fossette
sniffed
at
it
and
then
walked
away
and
lay
down
with
a
dog
sigh
in
front
of
the
kitchen
fire
she
had
been
deranged
in
her
habits
that
day
she
was
conscious
of
neglect
due
to
events
which
passed
her
comprehension
and
she
did
not
like
it
she
was
hurt
and
her
appetite
was
hurt
however
after
a
few
minutes
she
began
to
reconsider
the
matter
she
glanced
at
the
and
on
the
chance
that
it
might
after
all
contain
something
worth
inspection
she
awkwardly
balanced
herself
on
her
old
legs
and
went
to
it
again
the
end
