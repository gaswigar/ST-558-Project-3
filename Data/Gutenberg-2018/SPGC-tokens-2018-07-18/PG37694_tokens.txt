introduction
colonel
ethan
allen
the
author
of
oracles
of
reason
was
the
son
of
joseph
allen
a
native
of
coventry
connecticut
a
farmer
in
moderate
circumstances
he
afterwards
resided
in
litchfield
where
ethan
was
born
in
the
year
the
family
consisted
of
eight
children
of
whom
our
author
was
the
eldest
but
few
incidents
connected
with
his
early
life
are
known
we
are
apprised
however
that
notwithstanding
his
education
was
very
limited
his
ambition
to
prove
himself
worthy
of
that
attention
which
superior
intellect
ever
commands
induced
him
diligently
to
explore
every
subject
that
came
under
his
notice
a
stranger
to
fear
his
opinions
were
ever
given
without
disguise
or
hesitation
and
an
enemy
to
oppression
he
sought
every
opportunity
to
redress
the
wrongs
of
the
oppressed
at
the
breaking
out
of
the
revolutionary
war
he
raised
in
vermont
where
he
had
resided
a
company
of
volunteers
consisting
of
two
hundred
and
thirty
with
which
he
surprised
the
fortress
of
ticonderoga
may
containing
about
forty
men
and
one
hundred
pieces
of
cannon
he
was
unfortunately
taken
prisoner
in
september
following
in
an
attempt
on
montreal
and
sufferred
a
cruel
imprisonment
for
several
years
for
an
account
of
which
the
reader
is
referred
to
his
narrative
contained
in
a
memoir
of
the
author
by
hugh
moore
plattsburg
soon
after
the
close
of
the
revolution
allen
composed
the
following
work
which
on
account
of
the
bold
and
unusual
manner
particularly
in
this
country
that
the
subject
of
religion
is
treated
he
had
great
difficulty
to
get
published
it
lay
a
long
time
in
the
hands
of
a
printer
at
hartford
who
had
not
the
moral
courage
to
print
it
it
was
finally
printed
by
a
haswell
of
bennington
in
not
long
after
its
publication
a
part
of
the
edition
comprising
the
entire
of
several
signatures
was
accidentally
consumed
by
fire
whether
deemed
this
fire
a
judgment
upon
him
for
having
printed
the
work
or
not
is
unknown
but
the
fact
is
he
soon
after
committed
the
remainder
of
the
edition
to
the
flames
and
joined
the
methodist
connection
so
that
but
few
copies
were
circulated
allen
died
in
the
town
of
burlington
on
the
of
february
of
apoplexy
preface
an
apology
appears
to
me
to
be
impertinent
in
writers
who
venture
their
works
to
public
inspection
for
this
obvious
reason
that
if
they
need
it
they
should
have
been
stifled
in
the
birth
and
not
permitted
a
public
existence
i
therefore
offer
my
composition
to
the
candid
judgment
of
the
impartial
world
without
it
taking
it
for
granted
that
i
have
as
good
a
natural
right
to
expose
myself
to
public
censure
by
endeavouring
to
subserve
mankind
as
any
of
the
species
who
have
published
their
productions
since
the
creation
and
i
ask
no
favor
at
the
hands
of
philosophers
divines
or
critics
but
hope
and
expect
they
will
severely
chastise
me
for
my
errors
and
mistakes
least
they
may
have
a
share
in
perverting
the
truth
which
is
very
far
from
my
intention
in
the
circle
of
my
acquaintance
which
has
not
been
small
i
have
generally
been
denominated
a
deist
the
reality
of
which
i
never
disputed
being
conscious
i
am
no
christian
except
mere
infant
baptism
make
me
one
and
as
to
being
a
deist
i
know
not
strictly
speaking
whether
i
am
one
or
not
for
i
have
never
read
their
writings
mine
will
therefore
determine
the
matter
for
i
have
not
in
the
least
disguised
my
sentiments
but
have
written
freely
without
any
conscious
knowledge
of
prejudice
for
or
against
any
man
sectary
or
party
whatever
but
wish
that
good
sense
truth
and
virtue
may
be
promoted
and
flourish
in
the
world
to
the
detection
of
delusion
superstition
and
false
religion
and
therefore
my
errors
in
the
succeeding
treatise
which
may
be
rationally
pointed
out
will
be
readily
rescinded
by
the
public
most
obedient

the
duty
of
reforming
mankind
from
superstition
and
error
and
the
good
consequences
of
it
the
desire
of
knowledge
has
engaged
the
attention
of
the
wise
and
curious
among
mankind
in
all
ages
which
has
been
productive
of
extending
the
arts
and
sciences
far
and
wide
in
the
several
quarters
of
the
globe
and
excited
the
contemplative
to
explore
nature
laws
in
a
gradual
series
of
improvement
until
philosophy
astronomy
geography
and
history
with
many
other
branches
of
science
have
arrived
to
a
great
degree
of
perfection
it
is
nevertheless
to
be
regretted
that
the
bulk
of
mankind
even
in
those
nations
which
are
most
celebrated
for
learning
and
wisdom
are
still
carried
down
the
torrent
of
superstition
and
entertain
very
unworthy
apprehensions
of
the
being
perfections
creation
and
providence
of
god
and
their
duty
to
him
which
lays
an
indispensable
obligation
on
the
philosophic
friends
of
human
nature
unanimously
to
exert
themselves
in
every
lawful
wise
and
prudent
method
to
endeavor
to
reclaim
mankind
from
their
ignorance
and
delusion
by
enlightening
their
minds
in
those
great
and
sublime
truths
concerning
god
and
his
providence
and
their
obligations
to
moral
rectitude
which
in
this
world
and
that
which
is
to
come
can
not
fail
greatly
to
affect
their
happiness
and
well
being
though
none
by
searching
can
find
out
god
or
the
almighty
to
perfection
yet
i
am
persuaded
that
if
mankind
would
dare
to
exercise
their
reason
as
freely
on
those
divine
topics
as
they
do
in
the
common
concerns
of
life
they
would
in
a
great
measure
rid
themselves
of
their
blindness
and
superstition
gain
more
exalted
ideas
of
god
and
their
obligations
to
him
and
one
another
and
be
proportionally
delighted
and
blessed
with
the
views
of
his
moral
government
make
better
members
of
society
and
acquire
many
powerful
incentives
to
the
practice
of
morality
which
is
the
last
and
greatest
perfection
that
human
nature
is
capable
of
secton
ii
of
the
being
of
a
god
the
laws
of
nature
having
subjected
mankind
to
a
state
of
absolute
dependence
on
something
out
of
it
and
manifestly
beyond
themselves
or
the
compound
exertion
of
their
natural
powers
gave
them
the
first
conception
of
a
superior
principle
existing
otherwise
they
could
have
had
no
possible
conception
of
a
superintending
power
but
this
sense
of
dependency
which
results
from
experience
and
reasoning
on
the
facts
which
every
day
can
not
fail
to
produce
has
uniformly
established
the
knowledge
of
our
dependence
to
every
individual
of
the
species
who
are
rational
which
necessarily
involves
or
contains
in
it
the
idea
of
a
ruling
power
or
that
there
is
a
god
which
ideas
are
synonymous
the
globe
with
its
productions
the
planets
in
their
motions
and
the
starry
heavens
in
their
magnitudes
surprise
our
senses
and
confound
our
reason
in
their
munificent
lessons
of
instruction
concerning
god
by
means
whereof
we
are
apt
to
be
more
or
less
lost
in
our
ideas
of
the
object
of
divine
adoration
though
at
the
same
time
every
one
is
truly
sensible
that
their
being
and
preservation
is
from
god
we
are
too
apt
to
confound
our
ideas
of
god
with
his
works
and
take
the
latter
for
the
former
thus
barbarous
and
unlearned
nations
have
imagined
that
inasmuch
as
the
sun
in
its
influence
is
beneficial
to
them
in
bringing
forward
the
spring
of
the
year
causing
the
production
of
vegetation
and
food
for
their
subsistence
that
therefore
it
is
their
god
while
others
have
located
other
parts
of
creation
and
ascribe
to
them
prerogatives
of
god
and
mere
creatures
and
images
have
been
substituted
for
gods
by
the
wickedness
or
weakness
of
man
or
both
together
it
seems
that
mankind
in
most
ages
and
parts
of
the
world
have
been
fond
of
corporeal
deities
with
whom
their
outward
senses
might
be
gratified
or
as
fantastically
diverted
from
the
just
apprehension
of
the
true
god
by
a
supposed
supernatural
intercourse
with
invisible
and
mere
spiritual
beings
to
whom
they
ascribe
divinity
so
that
through
one
means
or
other
the
character
of
the
true
god
has
been
much
neglected
to
the
great
detriment
of
truth
justice
and
morality
in
the
world
nor
is
it
possible
that
mankind
can
be
uniform
in
their
religious
opinions
or
worship
god
according
to
knowledge
except
they
can
form
a
consistent
arrangement
of
ideas
of
the
divine
character
although
we
extend
our
ideas
retrospectively
ever
so
far
upon
the
succession
yet
no
one
cause
in
the
extended
order
of
succession
which
depends
upon
another
prior
to
itself
can
be
the
independent
cause
of
all
things
nor
is
it
possible
to
trace
the
order
of
the
succession
of
causes
back
to
that
cause
inasmuch
as
it
is
eternal
and
infinite
and
can
not
therefore
be
traced
out
by
succession
which
operates
according
to
the
order
of
time
consequently
can
bear
no
more
proportion
to
the
eternity
of
god
than
time
itself
may
be
supposed
to
do
which
has
no
proportion
at
all
as
the
succeeding
arguments
respecting
the
eternity
and
infinity
of
god
will
evince
but
notwithstanding
the
series
of
the
succession
of
causes
can
not
be
followed
in
a
retrospective
succession
up
to
the
or
eternal
cause
it
is
nevertheless
a
perpetual
and
conclusive
evidence
of
a
for
a
succession
of
causes
considered
collectively
can
be
nothing
more
than
effects
of
the
independent
cause
and
as
much
dependent
on
it
as
those
dependent
causes
are
upon
one
another
so
that
we
may
with
certainty
conclude
that
the
system
of
nature
which
we
call
by
the
name
of
natural
causes
is
as
much
dependent
on
a
cause
as
an
individual
of
the
species
in
the
order
of
generation
is
dependent
on
its
progenitors
for
existence
such
part
of
the
series
of
nature
operations
which
we
understand
has
a
regular
and
necessary
connection
with
and
dependence
on
its
parts
which
we
denominate
by
the
names
of
cause
and
effect
from
hence
we
are
authorised
from
reason
to
conclude
that
the
vast
system
of
causes
and
effects
are
thus
necessarily
connected
speaking
of
the
natural
world
only
and
the
whole
regularly
and
necessarily
dependent
on
a
cause
so
that
we
are
obliged
to
admit
an
independent
cause
and
ascribe
to
it
otherwise
it
could
not
be
independent
and
consequently
not
a
god
but
the
eternity
or
manner
of
the
existence
of
a
and
independent
being
is
to
all
finite
capacities
utterly
incomprehensible
yet
this
is
so
far
from
an
objection
against
the
reality
of
such
a
being
that
it
is
essentially
necessary
to
support
the
evidence
of
it
for
if
we
could
comprehend
that
being
whom
we
call
god
he
would
not
be
god
but
must
have
been
finite
and
that
in
the
same
degree
as
those
may
be
supposed
to
be
who
could
comprehend
him
therefore
so
certain
that
god
is
we
can
not
comprehend
his
essence
eternity
or
manner
of
existence
this
should
always
be
premised
when
we
assay
to
reason
on
the
being
perfection
eternity
and
infinity
of
god
or
of
his
creation
and
providence
as
far
as
we
understand
nature
we
are
become
acquainted
with
the
character
of
god
for
the
knowledge
of
nature
is
the
revelation
of
god
if
we
form
in
our
imagination
a
compendious
idea
of
the
harmony
of
the
universe
it
is
the
same
as
calling
god
by
the
name
of
harmony
for
there
could
be
no
harmony
without
regulation
and
no
regulation
without
a
regulator
which
is
expressive
of
the
idea
of
a
god
nor
could
it
be
possible
that
there
could
be
order
or
disorder
except
we
admit
of
such
a
thing
as
creation
and
creation
contains
in
it
the
idea
of
a
creator
which
is
another
appellation
for
the
divine
being
distinguishing
god
from
his
creation
furthermore
there
could
be
no
proportion
figure
or
motion
without
wisdom
and
power
wisdom
to
plan
and
power
to
execute
and
these
are
perfections
when
applied
to
the
works
of
nature
which
signify
the
agency
or
superintendency
of
god
if
we
consider
nature
to
be
matter
figure
and
motion
we
include
the
idea
of
god
in
that
of
motion
for
motion
implies
a
mover
as
much
as
creation
does
a
creator
if
from
the
composition
texture
and
tendency
of
the
universe
in
general
we
form
a
complex
idea
of
general
good
resulting
therefrom
to
mankind
we
implicitly
admit
a
god
by
the
name
of
good
including
the
idea
of
his
providence
to
man
and
from
hence
arises
our
obligations
to
love
and
adore
god
because
he
provides
for
and
is
beneficent
to
us
abstract
the
idea
of
goodness
from
the
character
of
god
and
it
would
cancel
all
our
obligations
to
him
and
excite
us
to
hate
and
detest
him
as
a
tyrant
hence
it
is
that
ignorant
people
are
superstitiously
misled
into
a
conceit
that
they
hate
god
when
at
the
same
time
it
is
only
the
idol
of
their
own
imagination
which
they
truly
ought
to
hate
and
be
ashamed
of
but
were
such
persons
to
connect
the
ideas
of
power
wisdom
goodness
and
all
possible
perfection
in
the
character
of
god
their
hatred
towards
him
would
be
turned
into
love
and
adoration
by
extending
our
ideas
in
a
larger
circle
we
shall
perceive
our
dependence
on
the
earth
and
waters
of
the
globe
which
we
inhabit
and
from
which
we
are
bountifully
fed
and
gorgeously
arrayed
and
next
extend
our
ideas
to
the
sun
whose
fiery
mass
darts
its
brilliant
rays
of
light
to
our
terraqueous
ball
with
amazing
velocity
and
whose
region
of
inexhaustible
fire
supplies
it
with
fervent
heat
which
causes
vegetation
and
gilds
the
various
seasons
of
the
year
with
ten
thousand
charms
this
is
not
the
achievement
of
man
but
the
workmanship
and
providence
of
god
but
how
the
sun
is
supplied
with
materials
thus
to
perpetuate
its
kind
influences
we
know
not
but
will
any
one
deny
the
reality
of
those
beneficial
influences
because
we
do
not
understand
the
manner
of
the
perpetuality
of
that
fiery
world
or
how
it
became
such
a
body
of
fire
or
will
any
one
deny
the
reality
of
nutrition
by
food
because
we
do
not
understand
the
secret
operation
of
the
digesting
powers
of
animal
nature
or
the
minute
particulars
of
its
cherishing
influence
none
will
be
so
stupid
as
to
do
it
equally
absurd
would
it
be
for
us
to
deny
the
providence
of
god
by
whom
we
live
move
and
have
our
being
because
we
can
not
comprehend
it
we
know
that
earth
water
fire
and
air
in
their
various
compositions
subserve
us
and
we
also
know
that
these
elements
are
devoid
of
reflection
reason
or
design
from
whence
we
may
easily
infer
that
a
wise
understanding
and
designing
being
has
ordained
them
to
be
thus
subservient
could
blind
chance
constitute
order
and
decorum
and
consequently
a
providence
that
wisdom
order
and
design
should
be
the
production
of
nonentity
or
of
chaos
confusion
and
old
night
is
too
absurd
to
deserve
a
serious
confutation
for
it
supposeth
that
there
may
be
effects
without
a
cause
viz
produced
by
nonentity
or
that
chaos
and
confusion
could
produce
the
effects
of
power
wisdom
and
goodness
such
absurdities
as
these
we
must
assent
to
or
subscribe
to
the
doctrine
of
a
and
providential
being
secton
iii
the
manner
of
discovering
the
moral
perfections
and
attributes
of
god
having
in
a
concise
manner
offered
a
variety
of
indisputable
reasons
to
evince
the
certainty
of
the
being
and
providence
of
god
and
of
his
goodness
to
man
through
the
intervention
of
the
series
of
operations
which
are
commonly
described
by
the
name
of
natural
causes
we
come
now
more
particularly
to
the
consideration
of
his
moral
perfections
and
though
all
finite
beings
fall
as
much
short
of
an
adequate
knowledge
thereof
as
they
do
of
perfection
itself
nevertheless
through
the
intelligence
of
our
own
souls
we
may
have
something
of
a
prospective
idea
of
the
divine
perfections
for
though
the
human
mind
bears
no
proportion
to
the
divine
yet
there
is
undoubtedly
a
resemblance
between
them
for
instance
god
knows
all
things
and
we
know
some
things
and
in
the
things
which
we
do
understand
our
knowledge
agrees
with
that
of
the
divine
and
can
not
fail
necessarily
corresponding
with
it
to
more
than
know
a
thing
speaking
of
that
thing
only
is
impossible
even
to
omniscience
itself
for
knowledge
is
but
the
same
in
both
the
infinite
and
finite
minds
to
know
a
thing
is
the
same
as
to
have
right
ideas
of
it
or
ideas
according
to
truth
and
truth
is
uniform
in
all
rational
minds
the
divine
mind
not
excepted
it
will
not
be
disputed
but
that
mankind
in
plain
and
common
matters
understand
justice
from
injustice
truth
from
falsehood
right
from
wrong
virtue
from
vice
and
from
for
other
wise
they
could
not
be
accountable
creatures
this
being
admitted
we
are
capable
of
forming
a
complex
idea
of
a
moral
character
which
when
done
in
the
most
deliberate
the
wisest
and
most
rational
manner
in
our
power
we
are
certain
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
divine
perfections
for
as
we
learn
from
the
worlds
of
nature
an
idea
of
the
power
and
wisdom
of
god
so
from
our
own
rational
nature
we
learn
an
idea
of
his
moral
perfections
from
what
has
been
observed
on
the
moral
perfections
of
god
we
infer
that
all
rational
beings
who
have
an
idea
of
justice
goodness
and
truth
have
at
the
same
time
either
a
greater
or
less
idea
of
the
moral
perfections
of
god
it
is
by
reason
that
we
are
able
to
compound
an
idea
of
a
moral
character
whether
applied
to
god
or
man
it
is
that
which
gives
us
the
supremacy
over
the
irrational
part
of
the
creation
secton
iv
the
cause
of
idolatry
and
the
remedy
of
it
inasmuch
as
god
is
not
corporeal
and
consequently
does
not
and
can
not
come
within
the
notice
of
our
bodily
sensations
we
are
therefore
obliged
to
deduce
inferences
from
his
providence
and
particularly
from
our
own
rational
nature
in
order
to
form
our
conceptions
of
the
divine
character
which
through
inattention
want
of
learning
or
through
the
natural
imbecility
of
mankind
or
through
the
artifice
of
designing
men
or
all
together
they
have
been
greatly
divided
and
subdivided
in
their
notions
of
a
god
many
have
so
groped
in
the
dark
as
wholly
to
mistake
the
proper
object
of
divine
worship
and
not
distinguishing
the
creator
from
his
creation
have
paid
adoration
to
four
footed
beasts
and
creeping
things
and
some
have
ascribed
divine
honors
to
the
sun
moon
or
stars
while
others
have
been
infatuated
to
worship
dumb
senseless
and
unintelligent
idols
which
derived
their
existence
as
gods
partly
from
mechanics
who
gave
them
their
figure
proportion
and
beauty
and
partly
from
their
priests
who
gave
them
their
attributes
whose
believers
it
appears
were
so
wrought
upon
that
they
cried
out
in
the
ecstasy
of
their
deluded
zeal
great
is
diana
whatever
delusions
have
taken
place
in
the
world
relative
to
the
object
of
divine
worship
or
respecting
the
indecencies
or
immoralities
of
the
respective
superstitions
themselves
or
by
what
means
soever
introduced
or
perpetuated
whether
by
designing
men
whose
interest
it
has
always
been
to
impose
on
the
weakness
of
the
great
mass
of
the
vulgar
or
as
it
is
probable
that
part
of
those
delusions
took
place
in
consequence
of
the
weakness
of
uncultivated
reason
in
deducing
a
visible
instead
of
an
invisible
god
from
the
works
of
nature
be
that
as
it
will
mankind
are
generally
possessed
of
an
idea
that
there
is
a
god
however
they
may
have
been
mistaken
or
misled
as
to
the
object
this
notion
of
a
god
as
has
been
before
observed
must
have
originated
from
a
universal
sense
of
dependence
which
mankind
have
on
something
that
is
more
wise
powerful
and
beneficent
than
themselves
or
they
could
have
had
no
apprehensions
of
any
superintending
principle
in
the
universe
and
consequently
would
never
have
sought
after
a
god
or
have
had
any
conception
of
his
existence
nor
could
designing
men
have
imposed
on
their
credulity
by
obtruding
false
gods
upon
them
but
taking
advantage
of
the
common
belief
that
there
is
a
god
they
artfully
deceive
their
adherents
with
regard
to
the
object
to
be
adored
there
are
other
sorts
of
idols
which
have
no
existence
but
in
the
mere
imagination
of
the
human
mind
and
these
are
vastly
the
most
numerous
and
universally
either
in
the
greater
or
less
degree
dispersed
over
the
world
the
wisest
of
mankind
are
not
and
can
not
be
wholly
exempt
from
them
inasmuch
as
every
wrong
conception
of
god
is
as
far
as
the
error
takes
place
in
the
mind
idolatrous
to
give
a
sample
an
idea
of
a
jealous
god
is
of
this
sort
jealousy
is
the
offspring
of
finite
minds
proceeding
from
the
want
of
knowledge
which
in
dubious
matters
makes
us
suspicious
and
distrustful
but
in
matters
which
we
clearly
understand
there
can
be
no
jealousy
for
knowledge
excludes
it
so
that
to
ascribe
it
to
god
is
a
manifest
infringement
on
his
omniscience
the
lord
thy
god
is
a
jealous
god
the
idea
of
a
revengeful
god
is
likewise
one
of
that
sort
but
this
idea
of
divinity
being
borrowed
from
a
savage
nature
needs
no
further
confutation
the
representation
of
a
god
who
as
we
are
told
by
certain
divines
from
all
eternity
elected
an
inconsiderable
part
of
mankind
to
eternal
life
and
reprobated
the
rest
to
eternal
damnation
merely
from
his
own
sovereignty
adds
another
to
the
number
this
representation
of
the
deity
undoubtedly
took
its
rise
from
that
which
we
discovered
in
great
powerful
and
wicked
tyrants
among
men
however
tradition
may
since
have
contributed
to
its
support
though
i
am
apprehensive
that
a
belief
in
those
who
adhere
to
that
doctrine
that
they
themselves
constitute
that
blessed
elect
number
has
been
a
greater
inducement
to
them
to
close
with
it
than
all
other
motives
added
together
it
is
a
selfish
and
inferior
notion
of
a
god
void
of
justice
goodness
and
truth
and
has
a
natural
tendency
to
impede
the
cause
of
true
religion
and
morality
in
the
world
and
diametrically
repugnant
to
the
truth
of
the
divine
character
and
which
if
admitted
to
be
true
overturns
all
religion
wholly
precluding
the
agency
of
mankind
in
either
their
salvation
or
damnation
resolving
the
whole
into
the
sovereign
disposal
of
a
tyrannical
and
unjust
being
which
is
offensive
to
reason
and
common
sense
and
subversive
of
moral
rectitude
in
general
but
as
it
was
not
my
design
so
much
to
confute
the
multiplicity
of
false
representations
of
a
god
as
to
represent
just
and
consistent
ideas
of
the
true
god
i
shall
therefore
omit
any
further
observation
on
them
in
this
place
with
this
remark
that
all
unjust
representations
or
ideas
of
god
are
so
many
detractions
from
his
character
among
mankind
to
remedy
these
idolatrous
notions
of
a
god
it
is
requisite
to
form
right
and
consistent
ideas
in
their
stead
the
discovery
of
truth
necessarily
excludes
error
from
the
mind
which
nothing
else
can
possibly
do
for
some
sort
of
god
or
other
will
crowd
itself
into
the
conceptions
of
dependent
creatures
and
if
they
are
not
so
happy
as
to
form
just
ones
they
will
substitute
erroneous
and
delusive
ones
in
their
stead
so
that
it
serves
no
valuable
purpose
to
mankind
to
confute
their
idolatrous
opinions
concerning
god
without
communicating
to
them
just
notions
concerning
the
true
one
for
if
this
is
not
effected
nothing
is
done
to
the
purpose
for
as
has
been
before
observed
mankind
will
form
to
themselves
or
receive
from
others
an
idea
of
divinity
either
right
or
wrong
this
is
the
universal
voice
of
intelligent
nature
from
whence
a
weighty
and
conclusive
argument
may
be
drawn
of
the
reality
of
a
god
however
inconsistent
most
of
their
conceptions
of
him
may
be
the
fact
is
mankind
readily
perceives
that
there
is
a
god
by
feeling
their
dependence
on
him
and
as
they
explore
his
works
and
observe
his
providence
which
is
too
sublime
for
finite
capacities
to
understand
but
in
part
they
have
been
more
or
less
confounded
in
their
discoveries
of
a
just
idea
of
a
god
and
of
his
moral
government
therefore
we
should
exercise
great
applications
and
care
whenever
we
assay
to
speculate
upon
the
divine
character
accompanied
with
a
sincere
desire
after
truth
and
not
ascribe
anything
to
his
perfections
of
government
which
is
inconsistent
with
reason
or
the
best
information
which
we
are
able
to
apprehend
of
moral
rectitude
and
be
at
least
wise
enough
not
to
charge
god
with
injustice
and
contradictions
which
we
should
scorn
to
be
charged
with
ourselves
no
king
governor
or
parent
would
like
to
be
accused
of
partiality
in
their
respective
governments
is
it
fit
to
say
unto
princes
ye
are
ungodly
how
much
less

him
that

argued

at
the

time
it
is
mysterious
to
us
that
there
should
be
such
a

as
a

independent
one
thus
we
believe
in

although
we
can
not
comprehend
anything
of
the
how
why
or
wherefore
it
was
possible
for
him
to
be

as

was
the

of
such
an
incomprehensible

it
must
of

be

ii
observations
of
moses
account
of
creation
the
foregoing
theory
of
creation
and
providence
will
probably
be
rejected
by
most
people
in
this
country
inasmuch
as
they
are
prepossessed
with
the
theology
of
moses
which
represents
creation
to
have
a
beginning
in
the
beginning
god
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
in
the
preceding
part
of
this
chapter
it
has
been
evinced
that
creation
and
providence
could
not
have
had
a
beginning
and
that
they
are
not
circumscribed
but
unlimited
yet
it
seems
that
moses
limited
creation
by
a
prospective
view
of
the
heavens
or
firmament
from
this
globe
and
if
creation
was
thus
limited
it
would
consequently
have
circumscribed
the
dominion
and
display
of
the
divine
providence
or
perfection
but
if
moses
idea
of
the
creation
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
was
immense
ever
so
many
days
of
progressive
work
could
never
have
finished
such
a
boundless
creation
for
a
progressive
creation
is
the
same
as
a
limited
one
as
each
progressive
day
work
would
be
bounded
by
a
successive
admeasurement
and
the
whole
six
days
work
added
together
could
be
but
local
and
bear
no
manner
of
proportion
to
infinitude
but
would
limit
the
dominion
and
consequently
the
display
of
the
divine
perfections
or
providence
which
is
incompatible
with
a
just
idea
of
eternity
and
infinity
of
god
as
has
been
argued
in
the
foregoing
pages
there
are
a
variety
of
other
blunders
in
moses
description
of
creation
one
of
which
i
shall
mention
which
is
to
be
found
in
his
history
of
the
first
and
fourth
day
work
of
god
and
god
said
let
there
be
light
and
there
was
light
and
god
called
the
light
day
and
the
darkness
he
called
night
and
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
first
day
then
he
proceeds
to
the
second
and
third
day
work
and
so
on
to
the
sixth
but
in
his
chronicle
of
the
fourth
day
work
he
says
that
god
made
two
great
lights
the
greater
light
to
rule
the
day
and
the
lesser
light
to
rule
the
night
this
appears
to
be
an
inconsistent
history
of
the
origin
of
light
day
and
night
were
ordained
the
first
day
and
on
the
fourth
day
the
greater
and
less
lights
were
made
to
serve
the
same
purposes
but
it
is
likely
that
many
errors
have
crept
into
his
writings
through
the
vicissitudes
of
learning
and
particularly
from
the
corruptions
of
translations
of
his
as
well
as
the
writings
of
other
ancient
authors
besides
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
those
ancient
writers
labored
under
great
difficulties
in
writing
to
posterity
merely
from
the
consideration
of
the
infant
state
of
learning
and
knowledge
then
in
the
world
and
consequently
we
should
not
act
the
part
of
severe
critics
with
their
writings
any
further
than
to
prevent
their
obtrusion
on
the
world
as
being

of

appear
fair

by

make

far
remote

our
feeble
discoveries
which
merely
by
the
eye
could
not
have
been
discerned
or
distinguished
these
discoveries
of
the
works
of
god
naturally
prompt
the
inquisitive
mind
to
conclude
that
the
author
of
this
astonishing
part
of
creation
which
is
displayed
to
our
view
has
still
extended
his
creation
so
that
if
it
were
possible
that
any
of
us
could
be
transported
to
the
farthest
extended
star
which
is
perceptible
to
us
here
we
should
from
thence
survey
worlds
as
distant
from
that
as
that
is
from
this
and
so
on
furthermore
it
is
altogether
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
heavenly
bodies
worlds
which
move
or
are
situate
within
the
circle
of
our
knowledge
as
well
all
others
throughout

are

one
of
them
possessed

inhabited

some
intelligent
agents

other
however
different
their
sensations
or
manners
of
receiving

communicating
their

may
be
from
ours
or
however
different
from
each
other
for
why
would
it
not
have
been
as
wise
or
as
consistent
with
the
perfections
which
we
adore
in
god
to
have
neglected
giving
being
to
intelligence
in
this

as
in
those
other

interspersed
with
aether
of
various
qualities
in
his
immense
creation

is
thus
replenished
we
may
with
the
highest
rational
certainty
infer
that
as
god
has
given
us
to
rejoice
and
adore
him
for
our
being
he
has
acted
consistent
with
his
goodness
in
the
display
of
his
providence
throughout
the
university
of
worlds
to
suppose
that
god
almighty
has
confined
his
goodness
to
this
world
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
is
much
similar
to
the
idle
fancies
of
some
individuals
in
this
world
that
they
and
those
of
their
communion
or
faith
are
the
favorites
of
heaven
exclusively
but
these
are
narrow
and
bigoted
conceptions
which
are
degrading
to
a
rational
nature
and
utterly
unworthy
of
god
of
whom
we
should
form
the
most
exalted
ideas
it
may
be
objected
that
a
man
can
not
subsist
in
the
sun
but
does
it
follow
from
thence
that
god
can
not
or
has
not
constituted
a
nature
peculiar
to
that
fiery
region
and
caused
it
to
be
as
natural
and
necessary
for
it
to
suck
in
and
breathe
out
flames
of
fire
as
it
is
for
us
to
do
the
like
in
air
numerous
are
the
kinds
of
fishy
animals
which
can
no
other
way
subsist
but
in
the
water
in
which
other
animals
would
perish
amphibious

while
other

swifter

are

which
during
the

of
winter
live
without

and
many
of
the
insects
which
are
really
possessed
of
animal
life
remain
frozen
and
as
soon
as
they
are
let
loose
by
the
kind
influence
of
the
sun
they
again
assume
their
wonted
animal
life
and
if
animal
life
may
differ
so
much
in
the
same
world
what
inconceivable
variety
may
be
possible
in
worlds
innumerable
as
applicable
to
mental
cogitative
and
organized
beings
certain
it
is
that
any
supposed
obstructions
concerning
the
quality
or
temperature
of
any
or
every
one
of
those
worlds
could
not
have
been
any
bar
in
the
way
of
god
almighty
with
regard
to
his
replenishing
his
universal
creation
with
moral
agents
the
unlimited
perfection
of
god
could
perfectly
well
adapt
every
part
of
his
creation
to
the
design
of
whatever
rank
or
species
of
constituted
beings
his
godlike
wisdom
and
goodness
saw
fit
to
impart
existence
to
so
that
as
there
is
no
deficiency
of
absolute
perfection
in
god
it
is
rationally
demonstrative
that
the
immense
creation
is
replenished
with
rational
agents
and
that
it
has
been
eternally
so
and
that
the
display
of
divine
goodness
must
have
been
as
perfect
and
complete
in
the
antecedent
as
it
is
possible
to
be
in
the
subsequent
eternity
from
this
theological
way
of
arguing
on
the
creation
and
providence
of
god
it
appears
that
the
whole
which
we
denominate
by
the
term
which
is
the
same
as

perfectly
regulated
was
eternally
connected
together
by
the

to
answer
the

all
glorious
purpose
the

of
the
divine
nature
the
consequences
of
which
are
existence
and

to
beings
in

so
that

with
all
its
productions
operates
according
to
the
laws
of

is
sustained
by
the
eternal
cause

decorum

well
it
is
that
they
are
given
in
so
great
profusion
that
they
can
not
by
the
monopoly
of
the
rich
be
engrossed
from
the
poor
when
we
copiously
pursue
the
study
of

we
are
certain
to
be
lost
in
the
immensity
of

of

may
nevertheless
in

discern
their
fitness

uniform

consistent
in
his
infinitude
of

although
we
can
not
comprehend
all
that
consistency
by
reason
of
infirmity
yet
we
are
morally
sure
of
all
possible
plans
infinite
wisdom
must
have
eternally
adopted
the
best
and
infinite
goodness
have
approved
it
and
infinite
power
have
perfected
it

as
the
good
of
beings
in

must
have
been
the
ultimate
end
of

his
omniscience
could
not
fail
to
have
it
always

must
therefore
be
ultimately
attracted
to
this
single
point
and
infinite
perfection
must
have

displayed
itself
in

we

there
has
been
a
concatenation
of
causes
and
events
which
has
reached
from
god
down
to
this
time
and
which
will
eternally
be
continued

there
is

that
we
can

action

at
the

it
is
hard
for
such
persons
who
have
verily
believed
that
they
are

thus
by
a
predetermination
of

become
his
special

to
give
up
their
notions
of
a
predetermination
of
all
events
upon
which
system
their
election
and
everlasting
happiness
is
nonsensically
founded

on
the
other
hand
it
is
also
hard
for
them
to
go
so
evidently
against
the
law
of
nature
or
dictates
of
conscience
which
intuitively
evinces
the
certainty
of
human
liberty

to
reject

hold
to
both
parts

contradiction
that
they

chapter
iii
secton
i
the
doctrine
of
the
infinity
of
evil
and
of
sin
considered
that
god
is
infinitely
good
in
the
eternal
displays
of
his
providence
has
been
argued
in
the
third
section
of
the
second
chapter
from
which
we
infer
that
there
can
not
be
an
infinite
evil
in
the
universe
inasmuch
as
it
would
be
incompatible
with
infinite
good
yet
there
are
many
who
imbibe
the
doctrine
of
the
infinite
evil
of
sin
and
the
maxim
on
which
they
predicate
their
arguments
in
its
support
are
that
the
greatness
of
sin
or
adequateness
of
its
punishment
is
not
to
be
measured
or
its
viciousness
ascertained
by
the
capacity
and
circumstances
of
the
offender
but
by
the
capacity
and
dignity
of
the
being
against
whom
the
offence
is
committed
and
as
every
transgression
is
against
the
authority
and
law
of
god
it
is
therefore
against
god
and
as
god
is
infinite
therefore
sin
is
an
infinite
evil
and
from
hence
infer
the
infinite
and
vindictive
wrath
of
god
against
sinners
and
of
his
justice
in
dooming
them
as
some
say
to
infinite
and
others
say
to
eternal
misery
the
one
without
degree
or
measure
and
the
other
without
end
or
duration
admitting
this
maxim
for
truth
that
the
transgressions
or
sins
of
mankind
are
to
be
estimated
by
their
heinousness
by
the
dignity
and
infinity
of
the
divine
nature
then
it
will
follow
that
all
sins
would
be
equal
which
would
confound
all
our
notions
of
the
degrees
or
aggravations
of
sin
so
that
the
sin
would
be
the
same
to
kill
my
neighbor
as
it
would
be
to
kill
his
horse
for
the
divine
nature
by
this
maxim
being
the
rule
by
which
man
sin
is
to
be
estimated
and
always
the
same
there
could
therefore
be
no
degrees
in
sin
or
guilt
any
more
than
there
are
degrees
of
perfection
in
god
whom
we
all
admit
to
be
infinite
and
who
for
that
reason
only
can
not
admit
of
any
degrees
or
enlargement
therefore
as
certain
as
there
are
degrees
in
sin
the
infinity
of
the
divine
nature
can
not
be
the
standard
whereby
it
is
to
be
ascertained
which
single
consideration
is
a
sufficient
confutation
of
the
doctrine
of
the
infinite
evil
of
sin
as
predicated
on
that
maxim
inasmuch
as
none
are
so
stupid
as
not
to
discern
that
there
are
degrees
and
aggravations
in
sin
i
recollect
a
discourse
of
a
learned
ecclesiastic
who
was
laboring
in
support
of
this
doctrine
his
first
proposition
was
that
moral
rectitude
was
infinitely
pleasing
to
god
from
which
he
deduced
this
inference
that
a
contrariety
to
moral
rectitude
was
consequently
infinitely
displeasing
to
god
and
infinitely
evil
that
the
absolute
moral
rectitude
of
the
divine
nature
is
infinitely
well
pleasing
to
god
will
not
be
disputed
for
this
is
none
other
but
perfect
and
infinite
rectitude
but
there
can
not
in
nature
be
an
infinite
contrariety
thereto
or
any
being
infinitely
evil
or
infinite
in
any
respect
whatever
except
we
admit
a
and
infinite
diabolical
nature
which
is
too
absurd
to
deserve
argumentative
confutation
therefore
as
all
possible
moral
evil
must
result
from
the
agency
of
finite
beings
consisting
in
their
sinful
deviations
from
the
rules
of
eternal
unerring
order
and
reason
which
is
moral
rectitude
in
the
abstract
we
infer
that
provided
finite
beings
in
the
had
not
done
anything
else
but
sin
and
rebel
against
god
reason
and
moral
rectitude
in
general
all
possible
moral
evil
would
fall
as
much
short
of
being
infinite
as
all
finite
capacities
complexly
considered
would
fail
of
being
infinite
which
will
bear
no
proportion
at
all
for
though
as
has
been
before
argued
bear
a
to
yet
they
bear
proportion
to
his
and
therefore
there
is
not
and
can
not
be
any
being
beings
or
agency
of
being
or
beings
complexly
considered
or
otherwise
which
are
infinite
in
capacity
or
which
are
infinitely
evil
and
detestable
in
the
sight
of
god
in
that
unlimited
sense
for
the
actions
or
agency
of
limited
beings
are
also
limited
which
is
the
same
as
finite
so
that
both
the
virtues
and
vices
of
man
are
finite
they
are
not
virtuous
or
vicious
but
in
degree
therefore
moral
evil
is
finite
and
bounded
though
there
is
one
and
but
one
infinite
good
which
is
god
and
there
can
be
no
dispute
but
that
god
judges
and
approves
or
disapproves
of
all
things
and
beings
and
agencies
of
beings
as
in
truth
they
are
or
in
other
words
judges
of
every
thing
as
being
what
it
is
but
to
judge
a
finite
evil
to
be
infinite
would
be
infinitely
erroneous
and
disproportionate
for
so
certain
as
there
is
a
distinction
between
infinity
and
infinitude
so
certain
finite
sinful
agency
can
not
be
infinitely
evil
or
in
other
words
finite
offences
can
not
be
infinite
nor
is
it
possible
that
the
greatest
of
sinners
should
in
justice
deserve
infinite
punishment
or
their
nature
sustain
it
finite
beings
may
as
well
be
supposed
to
be
capable
of
infinite
happiness
as
of
infinite
misery
but
the
rank
which
they
hold
in
the
universe
exempts
them
from
either
it
nevertheless
admits
them
to
a
state
of
agency
probation
or
trial
consequently
to
interchangeable
progressions
in
moral
good
and
evil
and
of
course
to
alternate
happiness
or
misery
we
will
dismiss
the
doctrine
of
the
infinite
evil
of
sin
with
this
observation
that
as
no
mere
creature
can
suffer
an
infinitude
of
misery
or
of
punishment
it
is
therefore
incompatible
with
the
wisdom
of
god
so
far
to
capacitate
creatures
to
sin
as
in
his
constitution
of
things
to
foreclose
himself
from
adequately
punishing
them
for
it
secton
ii
the
moral
government
of
god
as
incompatible
with
eternal
punishment
we
may
for
certain
conclude
that
such
a
punishment
will
never
have
the
divine
approbation
or
be
inflicted
on
any
intelligent
being
or
beings
in
the
infinitude
of
the
government
of
god
for
an
endless
punishment
defeats
the
very
end
of
its
institution
which
in
all
wise
and
good
governments
is
as
well
to
reclaim
offenders
as
to
be
examples
to
others
but
a
government
which
does
not
admit
of
reformation
and
repentance
must
unavoidably
involve
its
subjects
in
misery
for
the
weakness
of
creatures
will
always
be
a
source
of
error
and
inconstancy
and
a
wise
governor
as
we
must
admit
god
to
be
would
suit
his
government
to
the
capacity
and
all
other
circumstances
of
the
governed
and
instead
of
inflicting
eternal
damnation
on
his
offending
children
would
rather
interchangeably
extend
his
beneficence
with
his
vindictive
punishments
so
as
to
alienate
them
from
sin
and
wickedness
and
incline
them
to
morality
convincing
them
from
experimental
suffering
that
sin
and
vanity
are
their
greatest
enemies
and
that
in
god
and
moral
rectitude
their
dependence
and
true
happiness
consists
and
by
reclaiming
them
from
wickedness
and
error
to
the
truth
and
to
the
love
and
practice
of
virtue
give
them
occasion
to
glorify
god
for
the
wisdom
and
goodness
of
his
government
and
to
be
ultimately
happy
under
it
but
we
are
told
that
the
eternal
damnation
of
a
part
of
mankind
greatly
augments
the
happiness
of
the
elect
who
are
represented
as
being
vastly
the
less
numerous
a
diabolical
temper
of
mind
in
the
elect
besides
how
narrow
and
contractive
must
such
notions

justice

goodness
be
who
would
imagine
that
the
deity
conducts
his

the
detestable
despots

the
reward
of

that
no

will
ever
be
inflicted
merely
by

that
will
finally
terminate
in
the

that

any

our

consists
in
our

can
not
fall
short
of

it
for
liberty

agency
itself
or
is
that
by
which
agency
or

is
exerted
it
may
be
that
the
curious
would
define
it
that
agency
is
the

that
liberty

on
the
doctrine
of
the
depravity
of

in
the
course
of
our
speculation
on

we
proceed
next
to
the
consideration
of
the
doctrine
of
the
depravity
of
human
reason
a
doctrine
derogatory
to
the
nature
of
man
and
the
rank
and
character
of
being
which
he
holds
in
the
universe
and
which
if
admitted
to
be
true
overturns
knowledge
and
science
and
renders
learning
instruction
and
books
useless
and
impertinent
inasmuch
as
reason
depraved
or
spoiled
would
cease
to
be
reason
as
much
as
the
mind
of
a
raving
madman
would
of
course
cease
to
be
rational
admitting
the
depravity
of
reason
the
consequence
would
unavoidably
follow
that
as
far
as
it
may
be
supposed
to
have
taken
place
in
the
midst
of
mankind
there
could
be
no
judges
of
it
in
consequence
of
their
supposed
depravity
for
without
the
exercise
of
reason
we
could
not
understand
what
reason
is
which
would
be
necessary
for
us
previously
to
understand
in
order
to
understand
what
it
is
not
or
to
distinguish
it
from
that
which
is
its
reverse
but
for
us
to
have
the
knowledge
of
what
reason
is
and
the
ability
to
distinguish
it
from
that
which
is
depraved
or
is
irrational
is
incompatible
with
the
doctrine
of
the
depravity
of
our
reason
inasmuch
as
to
understand
what
reason
is
and
to
distinguish
it
from
that
which
is
marred
or
spoiled
is
the
same
to
all
intents
and
purposes
as
to
have
exercise
and
enjoy
the
principle
of
reason
itself
which
precludes
its
supposed
depravity
so
that
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
understand
what
reason
is
and
at
the
same
time
determine
that
our
reason
is
depraved
for
this
would
be
the
same
as
when
we
know
that
we
are
in
possession
and
exercise
of
reason
to
determine
that
we
are
not
in
possession
or
exercise
of
it
it
may
be
that
some
who
embrace
the
doctrine
of
the
depravity
of
human
reason
will
not
admit
that
it
is
wholly
and
totally
depraved
but
that
it
is
in
a
great
measure
marred
or
spoiled
but
the
foregoing
arguments
are
equally
applicable
to
a
supposed
depravity
in
parts
as
in
the
whole
for
in
order
to
judge
whether
reason
be
depraved
in
part
or
not
it
would
be
requisite
to
have
an
understanding
of
what
reason
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
previous
to
its
premised
depravity
and
to
have
such
a
knowledge
of
it
would
be
the
same
as
to
exercise
and
enjoy
it
in
its
lustre
and
purity
which
would
preclude
the
notion
of
a
depravity
in
part
as
well
as
in
the
whole
for
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
us
to
judge
of
reason
undepraved
and
depraved
but
by
comparing
them
together
but
for
depraved
reason
to
make
such
a
comparison
is
contradictory
and
impossible
so
that
if
our
reason
had
been
depraved
we
could
not
have
had
any
conception
of
it
any
more
than
a
beast
men
of
small
faculties
in
reasoning
can
not
comprehend
the
extensive
reasonings
of
their
superiors
how
then
can
a
supposed
depraved
reason
comprehend
that
reason
which
is
uncorrupted
and
pure
to
suppose
that
it
could
is
the
same
as
to
suppose
that
depraved
and
undepraved
reason
is
alike
and
if
so
there
needs
no
further
dispute
about
it
there
is
a
manifest
contradiction
in
applying
the
term
to
that
of
reason
the
ideas
contained
in
their
respective
definitions
will
not
admit
of
their
association
together
as
the
terms
convey
heterogeneous
ideas
for
reason
spoiled
marred
or
robbed
of
its
perfection
ceaseth
to
be
rational
and
should
not
be
called

inasmuch
as
it
is
premised
to
be
depraved
or
degenerated
from
a
rational
nature
and
in
consequence
of
the
deprivation
of
its
nature
should
also
be
deprived
of
its
name
and
called
subterfuge
or
some
such
like
name
which
might
better
define
its
real
character
those
who
invalidate
reason
ought
seriously
to
consider
they
argue
against
reason
with
or
without
reason
if
with
reason
then
they
establish
the
principle
that
they
are
laboring
to
dethrone
but
if
they
argue
without

which
in
order
to
be
consistent
with
themselves
they
must
do

are
out

nor
do
they

we
are
told
that
the
knowledge
of
the
depravity

was
first
communicated
to
mankind
by
the
immediate
inspiration

but
inasmuch

is
supposed

what
principle
could
there
be
in
the
human

which
could
receive

the
inspiration

on
which
it
could
operate

to
represent

be
supposed
were

the

of
the
depravity
of
their
own

mankind
reason
in

for
a
rational
inspiration
must
consist
of
rational
ideas
which
that
the
minds
of
those
who
were
inspired
were
rational
previous
to
such
inspiration
which
would
be
a
downright
contradiction
to
the
inspiration
itself
the
import
of
which
was
to
teach
the
knowledge

reason
which
without
reason
could
not
be
understood
and

it
would
be
understood
that

was
false

advocates
for
the

suppose
that

ingrafts

superadds
the
essence

itself
to

to
be
so
yet
such

persons
could
not
understand
any
thing

before
the
reception
of
such
supposed
inspiration
nor
would
such
a
premised
inspiration
prove
to
its
possessors
or
receivers
that
their
reason
had
ever
been
depraved
all
that
such
premised
inspired
persons
could
understand

be
conscious
of
respecting
reason
would
be
after
the
inspiration
may
be
supposed
to
have
taken

and
made

rational

and
then
instead

being

that

could
not

of
it
nor
does
the
imparting
of
reason
argue
its
depravity
for
what
remains
of
reason
or
rather
of
the
exercise
of
it
is
reason
still
but
there
is
not
and
can
not
be
such
a
thing
as
depraved
reason
for
that
which
is
rational
is
so
and
for
that
reason
can
not
be
depraved
whatever
its
degree
of
exercise
may
be
supposed
to
be
a
blow
on
the
head
or
fracture
of
the
cranium
as
also
palsies
and
many
other
casualties
that
await
our
sensorium
retard
and
in
some
cases
wholly
prevent
the
exercise
of
reason
for
a
longer
or
shorter
period
and
sometimes
through
the
stage
of
human
life
but
in
such
instances
as
these
reason
is
not
depraved
but
ceases
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
or
perhaps
wholly
ceases
its
rational
exertions
or
operations
by
reason
of
the
breaches
or
disorders
of
the
organs
of
sense
but
in
such
instances
wherein
the
organs
become
rectified
and
the
senses
recover
their
usefulness
the
exercise
of
reason
returns
free
from
any
blemish
or
depravity
for
the
cessation
of
the
exercise
of
reason
by
no
means
depraves
it
from
what
has
been
argued
on
this
subject
in
this
and
the
preceding
chapters
it
appears
that
reason
is
not
and
can
not
be
depraved
but
that
it
bears
a
likeness
to
divine
reason
is
of
the
same
kind
and
in
its
own
nature
as
uniform
as
truth
which
is
the
test
of
it
though
in
the
divine
essence
it
is
eternal
and
infinite
but
in
man
it
is
eternal
only
as
it
respects
their
immortality
and
finite
as
it
respects
capaciousness
such
people
as
can
be
prevailed
upon
to
believe
that
their
reason
is
depraved
may
easily
be
led
by
the
nose
and
duped
into
superstition
at
the
pleasure
of
those
in
whom
they
confide
and
there
remain
from
generation
to
generation
for
when
they
throw
by
the
law
of
reason
only
which
god
gave
them
to
direct
them
in
their
speculations
and
duty
they
are
exposed
to
ignorant
or
insidious
teachers
and
also
to
their
own
irregular
passions
and
to
the
folly
and
enthusiasm
of
those
about
them
which
nothing
but
reason
can
prevent
or
restrain
nor
is
it
a
rational
supposition
that
the
commonality
of
mankind
would
ever
have
mistrusted
that
their
reason
was
depraved
had
they
not
been
told
so
and
it
is
whispered
about
that
the
first
insinuation
of
it
was
from
the
priests
though
the
armenian
clergymen
in
the
circle
of
my
acquaintance
have
exploded
the
doctrine
should
we
admit
the
depravity
of
reason
it
would
equally
affect
the
priesthood
or
any
other
teachers
of
that
doctrine
with
the
rest
of
mankind
but
for
depraved
creatures
to
receive
and
give
credit
to
a
depraved
doctrine
started
and
taught
by
depraved
creatures
is
the
greatest
weakness
and
folly
imaginable
and
comes
nearer
a
proof
of
the
doctrine
of
total
depravity
than
any
arguments
which
have
been
advanced
in
support
of
it
secton
ii
containing
a
disquisition
of
the
law
of
nature
as
it
respects
the
moral
system
interspersed
with
observations
on
subsequent
religions
that
mankind
are
by
nature
endowed
with
sensation
and
reflection
from
which
results
the
power
of
reason
and
understanding
will
not
be
disputed
the
senses
are
well
calculated
to
make
discoveries
of
external
objects
and
to
communicate
those
notices
or
simple
images
of
things
to
the
mind
with
all
the
magnificent
simplicity
of
nature
which
opens
an
extensive
field
of
contemplation
to
the
understanding
enabling
the
mind
to
examine
into
the
natural
causes
and
consequences
of
things
and
to
investigate
the
knowledge
of
moral
good
and
evil
from
which
together
with
the
power
of
agency
results
the
human
conscience
this
is
the
original
of
moral
obligation
and
accountability
which
is
called
natural
religion
for
without
the
understanding
of
truth
from
falsehood
and
right
from
wrong
which
is
the
same
as
justice
from
injustice
and
a
liberty
of
agency
which
is
the
same
as
a
power
of
proficiency
in
either
moral
good
or
evil
mankind
would
not
be
rational
or
accountable
creatures
undoubtedly
it
was
the
ultimate
design
of
our
creator
in
giving
us
being
and
furnishing
us
with
those
noble
compositions
of
mental
powers
and
sensitive
aptitudes
that
we
should
in
by
and
with
that
nature
serve
and
honor
him
and
with
those
united
capacities
search
out
and
understand
our
duty
to
him
and
to
one
another
with
the
ability
of
practising
the
same
as
far
as
may
be
necessary
for
us
in
this
life
to
object
against
the
sufficiency
of
natural
religion
to
effect
the
best
ultimate
good
of
mankind
would
be
derogating
from
the
wisdom
goodness
and
justice
of
god
who
in
the
course
of
his
providence
to
us
has
adopted
it
besides
if
natural
religion
may
be
supposed
to
be
deficient
what
security
can
we
have
that
any
subsequently
revealed
religion
should
not
be
so
also
for
why
might
not
a
second
religion
from
god
be
as
insufficient
or
defective
as
a
first
religion
may
be
supposed
to
be
from
hence
we
infer
that
if
natural
religion
be
insufficient
to
dictate
mankind
in
the
way
of
their
duty
and
make
them
ultimately
happy
there
is
an
end
to
religion
in
general
but
as
certain
as
god
is
perfect
in
wisdom
and
goodness
natural
religion
is
sufficient
and
complete
and
having
had
the
divine
approbation
and
naturally
resulting
from
a
rational
nature
is
as
universally
promulgated
to
mankind
as
reason
itself
but
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
claim
of
all
subsequent
religions
revelations
whether
denominated
inspired
external
supernatural
or
what
they
came
too
late
into
the
world
to
be
essential
to
the
well
being
of
mankind
or
to
point
out
to
them
the
only
way
to
heaven
and
everlasting
blessedness
inasmuch
as
for
the
greatest
part
of
mankind
who
have
ever
lived
in
this
world
have
departed
this
life
previous
to
the
eras
and
promulgations
of
such
revelations
besides
those
subsequent
revelations
to
the
law
of
nature
began
as
human
traditions
have
ever
done
in
very
small
circumferences
in
the
respective
parts
of
the
world
where
they
have
been
inculcated
and
made
their
progress
as
time
chance
and
opportunity
presented
does
this
look
like
the
contrivance
of
heaven
and
the
only
way
of
salvation
or
is
it
not
more
like
this
world
and
the
contrivance
of
man
undoubtedly
the
great
parent
of
mankind
laid
a
just
and
sufficient
foundation
of
salvation
for
every
one
of
them
for
otherwise
such
of
them
who
may
be
supposed
not
to
be
thus
provided
for
would
not
have
whereof
to
glorify
god
for
their
being
but
on
the
contrary
would
have
just
matter
of
complaint
against
his
providence
or
moral
government
for
involuntarily
necessitating
them
into
a
wretched
and
miserable
existence
and
that
without
end
or
remedy
which
would
be
ascribing
to
god
a
more
extensive
injustice
than
is
possible
to
be
charged
on
the
most
barbarous
despots
that
ever
were
among
mankind
but
to
return
to
our
speculations
on
the
law
of
nature
that
this
divine
law
surpasses
all
positive
institutions
that
have
ever
been
ushered
into
the
world
since
its
creation
as
much
as
the
wisdom
and
goodness
of
god
exceeds
that
of
man
is
beautifully
illustrated
in
the
following
quotation
but
it
may
be
said
what
is
virtue
it
is
the
faithful
discharge
of
those
obligations
which
reason
dictates
and
what
is
wisdom
itself
but
a
portion
of
intelligence
with
which
the
creator
has
furnished
us
in
order
to
direct
us
in
our
duty
it
may
be
further
asked
what
is
this
duty
whence
does
it
result
and
by
what
law
is
it
prescribed
i
answer
that
the
law
which
prescribed
it
is
the
immutable
will
of
god
to
which
right
reason
obliges
us
to
conform
ourselves
and
in
this
conformity
virtue
consists
no
law
which
has
commenced
since
the
creation
or
which
may
ever
cease
to
be
in
force
can
constitute
virtue
for
before
the
existence
of
such
a
law
mankind
could
not
be
bound
to
observe
it
but
they
were
certainly
under
an
obligation
to
be
virtuous
from
the
beginning
princes
may
make
laws
and
repeal
them
but
they
can
neither
make
nor
destroy
virtue
and
how
indeed
should
they
be
able
to
do
what
is
impossible
to
the
deity
himself
virtue
being
as
immutable
in
its
nature
as
the
divine
will
which
is
the
ground
of
it
virtue
did
not
derive
its
nature
merely
from
the
omnipotent
will
of
god
but
also
from
the
eternal
truth
and
moral
fitness
of
things
which
was
the
eternal
reason
why
they
were
eternally
approved
of
by
god
and
immutably
established
by
him
to
be
what
they
are
and
so
far
as
our
duty
is
connected
with
those
eternal
measures
of
moral
fitness
or
we
are
able
to
act
on
them
we
give
such
actions
or
habits
the
name
of
virtue
or
morality
but
when
we
in
writing
or
conversation
say
that
virtue
is
grounded
on
the
divine
will
we
should
at
the
same
time
include
in
the
complex
idea
of
it
that
the
divine
will
which
constituted
virtue
was
eternally
and
infinitely
reasonable
a
prince
may
command
his
subjects
to
pay
taxes
or
subsidies
may
forbid
them
to
export
certain
commodities
or
to
introduce
those
of
a
foreign
country
the
faithful
observance
of
these
laws
make
obedient
subjects
but
does
not
make
virtuous
men
and
would
any
one
seriously
think
himself
possessed
of
a
virtue
the
more
for
not
having
dealt
in
painted
calico
or
if
the
prince
should
by
his
authority
abrogate
these
laws
would
any
one
say
he
had
abrogated
virtue
it
is
thus
with
all
positive
laws
they
all
had
a
beginning
are
all
liable
to
exceptions
and
may
be
dispensed
with
and
even
abolished
that
law
alone
which
is
engraven
on
our
hearts
by
the
hand
of
our
creator
is
unchangeable
and
of
universal
and
eternal
obligation
the
law
says
cicero
is
not
a
human
invention
nor
an
arbitrary
political
institution
it
is
in
its
nature
eternal
and
of
universal
obligation
the
violence
tarquin
offered
to
lucretia
was
a
breach
of
that
eternal
law
and
though
the
romans
at
that
time
might
have
no
written
law
which
condemned
such
kind
of
crimes
his
offence
was
not
the
less
heinous
for
this
law
of
reason
did
not
then
begin
when
it
was
first
committed
to
writing
its
original
is
as
ancient
as
the
divine
mind
for
the
true
primitive
and
supreme
law
is
no
other
than
the
unerring
reason
of
the
great
jupiter
and
in
another
place
he
says
this
law
is
founded
in
nature
it
is
universal
immutable
and
eternal
it
is
subject
to
no
change
from
any
difference
of
place
or
time
it
extends
invariably
to
all
ages
and
nations
like
the
sovereign
dominion
of
that
being
who
is
author
of
it
the
promulgation
of
this
supreme
law
to
creatures
is
and
with
reason
and
binding
on
all
intelligent
beings
in
the
universe
and
is
that
eternal
rule
of
fitness
as
applicable
to
god
by
which
the
creator
of
all
things
conducts
his
infinitude
of
providence
and
by
which
he
governs
the
moral
system
of
being
according
to
the
absolute
perfection
of
his
nature
from
hence
we
infer
that
admitting
those
subsequent
revelations
which
have
more
or
less
obtained
credit
in
the
world
as
the
inspired
laws
of
god
to
be
consonant
to
the
laws
of
nature
yet
they
could
be
considered
as
none
other
but
mere
transcripts
therefrom
promulgated
to
certain
favorite
nations
when
at
the
same
time
all
mankind
was
favored
with
the
original
the
moral
precepts
contained
in
moses
decalogue
to
the
people
of
israel
was
previously
known
to
every
nation
under
heaven
and
in
all
probability
by
them
as
much
practised
as
by
the
tribes
of
israel
their
keeping
the
seventh
day
of
the
week
as
a
sabbath
was
an
arbitrary
imposition
of
moses
as
many
other
of
his
edicts
were
and
not
included
in
the
law
of
nature
but
as
to
such
laws
of
his
or
those
of
any
other
legislator
which
are
morally
fit
agree
with
and
are
a
part
of
the
natural
law
as
for
instance
thou
shalt
not
covet
or
kill
these
positive
injunctions
can
not
add
anything
to
the
law
of
nature
inasmuch
as
it
contains
an
entire
and
perfect
system
of
morality
nor
can
any
positive
injunctions
or
commands
enforce
the
authority
of
it
or
confer
any
additional
moral
obligation
on
those
to
whom
they
are
given
to
obey
the
previous
obligation
of
natural
religion
having
ever
been
as
binding
as
reason
can
possibly
conceive
of
or
the
order
and
constitution
of
the
moral
rectitude
of
things
as
resulting
from
god
can
make
it
to
be
to
illustrate
the
argument
of
the
obligatory
nature
of
the
natural
law
let
us
reverse
the
commandments
of
the
decalogue
by
premising
that
moses
had
said
thou
shalt
covet
thou
shalt
steal
and
murder
would
any
one
conclude
that
the
injunctions
would
have
been
obligatory
surely
they
would
not
for
a
positive
command
to
violate
the
law
of
nature
could
not
be
binding
on
any
rational
being
how
then
came
the
injunctions
of
moses
or
any
others
to
be
binding
in
such
cases
in
which
they
coincide
with
the
law
of
nature
we
answer
merely
in
consequence
of
the
obligatory
sanctions
of
the
natural
law
which
does
not
at
all
depend
on
the
authority
of
moses
or
of
any
other
legislator
short
of
him
who
is
eternal
and
infinite
nor
is
it
possible
that
the
jews
who
adhere
to
the
law
of
moses
should
be
under
greater
obligation
to
the
moral
law
than
the
japanese
or
the
christians
than
the
chinese
for
the
same
god
extends
the
same
moral
government
over
universal
rational
nature
independent
of
popes
priests
and
levites
but
with
respect
to
all
mere
positive
institutions
injunctions
rites
and
ceremonies
that
do
not
come
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
law
of
nature
they
are
political
matters
and
may
be
enacted
perpetuated
dispensed
with
abolished
compounded
or
diversified
as
conveniency
power
opportunity
inclination
or
interest
or
all
together
may
dictate
inasmuch
as
they
are
not
founded
on
any
stable
or
universal
principle
of
reason
but
change
with
the
customs
fashions
traditions
and
revolutions
of
the
world
having
no
centre
of
attraction
but
interest
power
and
advantages

the
creator

of
the

to
erect
a
particular
academy

in
this
world
under
his
immediate
inspection
with
tutors
rightly
organized
and
intellectually
qualified
to
carry
on
the
business
of
teaching
it
might
like
other
colleges
and
possibly
in
a
superior
manner
instruct
its
scholars
but
that
god
should
have
given
a
revelation
of
his
will
to
mankind
as
his
law
and
to
be
continued
to
the
latest
posterity
as
such
which
is
premised
to
be
above
the
capacity
of
their
understanding
is
contradictory
and
in
own
nature
impossible
nor
could
a
revelation
to
mankind
which
comes
within
the
circle
of
their
knowledge
be
edifying
or
instructing
to
them
for
it
is
a
contradiction
to
call
that
which
is
above
my
comprehension
or
that
which
i
already
from
natural
sagacity
understand
a
revelation
to
me
to
tell
me
or
inspire
me
with
the
knowledge
of
that
which
i
knew
before
would
reveal
nothing
to
me
and
to
reveal
that
to
me
which
is
supernatural
or
above
my
comprehension
is
contradictory
and
impossible
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
mankind
are
restricted
by
the
law
of
nature
to
acquire
knowledge
or
science
progressively
as
before
argued
from
which
we
infer
the
impropriety
and
consequently
the
impossibility
of
god
having
ever
given
us
any
manuscript
copy
of
his
eternal
law
for
that
to
reveal
it
at
first
would
bring
it
on
a
level
with
the
infancy
of
knowledge
then
in
the
world
or
fishermen
shepherds
and
illiterate
people
could
not
have
understood
it
which
would
have
brought
it
so
low
that
it
could
not
be
instructive
or
beneficial
to
after
generations
in
their
progressive
advances
in
science
and
wisdom
chapter

matters
as
mistaken
apprehensions
concerning
supernatural
inspiration
or
revelation
not
considering
that
all
true
religion
originates
from
reason
and
can
no
otherwise
be
understood
but
by
the
exercise
and
improvement
of
it
therefore
they
are
apt
to
confuse
their
minds
with
such
inconsistencies
in
the
subsequent
reasonings
on
this
subject
we
shall
argue
against
supernatural
revelation
in
general
which
will
comprehend
the
doctrine
of
inspiration
or
immediate
illumination
of
the
mind
and
first
we
will
premise
that
a
revelation
consists
of
an
assemblage
of
rational
ideas
intelligibly
arranged
and
understood
by
those
to
whom
it
may
be
supposed
to
be
revealed
for
otherwise
it
could
not
exist
in
their
minds
as
such
to
suppose
a
revelation
void
of
rationality
or
understanding
or
of
communicating
rational
intelligence
to
those
to
whom
it
maybe
supposed
to
be
given
would
be
a
contradiction
for
that
it
could
contain
nothing
except
it
were
unintelligibleness
which
would
be
the
same
as
to
reveal
and
not
to
reveal
therefore
a
revelation
must
consist
of
an
assemblage
of
rational
ideas
intelligibly
communicated
to
those
who
are
supposed
to
have
been
the
partakers
or
receivers
of
it
from
the
first
supposed
inspiration
down
to
this
or
any
other
period
of
time
but
such
a
revelation
as
this
could
be
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
transcript
of
the
law
of
nature
predicated
on
reason
and
would
be
no
more
supernatural
than
the
reason
of
man
may
be
supposed
to
be
the
simple
definition
of
supernatural
is
that
which
is
beyond
or
above
the
powers
of
nature
which
never
was
or
can
be
understood
by
mankind
the
first
promulgators
of
revelation
not
excepted
for
such
revelation
doctrine
precept
or
instruction
only
as
comes
within
the
powers
of
our
nature
is
capable
of
being
apprehended
contemplated
or
understood
by
us
and
such
as
does
not
is
to
us
incomprehensible
and
unknown
and
consequently
can
not
for
us
compose
any
part
of
revelation
the
author
of
human
nature
impressed
it
with
certain
sensitive
aptitudes
and
mental
powers
so
that
apprehension
reflection
or
understanding
could
no
otherwise
be
exerted
or
produced
in
the
compound
nature
of
man
but
in
the
order
prescribed
by
the
creator
it
would
therefore
be
a
contradiction
in
nature
and
consequently
impossible
for
god
to
inspire
infuse
or
communicate
the
apprehension
reflection
or
understanding
of
any
thing
whatever
into
human
nature
out
of
above
or
beyond
the
natural
aptitudes
and
mental
powers
of
that
nature
which
was
of
his
own
production
and
constitution
for
it
would
be
the
same
as
to
inspire
infuse
or
reveal
apprehension
reflection
or
understanding
to
that
which
is
not
inasmuch
as
out
of
beyond
or
above
the
powers
of
nature
there
could
be
nothing
to
operate
upon
as
a
prerequisite
principle
to
receive
the
inspiration
or
infusion
of
the
revelation
which
might
therefore
as
well
be
inspired
into
or
revealed
to
nonentity
as
to
man
for
the
essence
of
man
is
that
which
we
denominate
to
be
his
nature
out
of
or
above
which
he
is
as
void
of
sensation
apprehension
reflection
and
understanding
as
nonentity
may
be
supposed
to
be
therefore
such
revelation
as
is
adapted
to
the
nature
and
capacity
of
man
and
comes
within
his
powers
of
perception
and
understanding
is
the
only
revelation
which
he
is
able
to
receive
from
god
or
man
supernatural
revelation
is
as
applicable
to
beasts
birds
and
fishes
as
it
is
to
us
for
neither
we
nor
they
are
capable
of
being
acted
upon
supernaturally
as
all
the
possible
exertions
and
operations
of
nature
which
respect
the
natural
or
moral
world
are
truly
natural
nor
does
god
deviate
from
his
rectitude
of
nature
in
matters
of
inspiration
revelation
or
instruction
to
the
moral
world
any
more
than
in
that
of
his
government
of
the
natural
the
infinitude
of
the
wisdom
of
creation
providence
and
moral
government
will
eternally
remain
supernatural
to
all
finite
capacities
and
for
that
very
reason
we
can
never
arrive
to
the
comprehension
of
it
in
any
state
of
being
and
improvement
whatever
inasmuch
as
progression
can
never
attain
to
that
which
is
infinite
so
that
an
eternal
proficiency
in
knowledge
could
not
be
supernatural
but
on
the
other
hand
would
come
within
the
limits
and
powers
of
our
nature
for
otherwise
such
proficiency
would
be
impossible
to
us
nor
is
this
infinite
knowledge
of
god
supernatural
to
him
for
that
his
perfection
is
also
infinite
but
if
we
could
break
over
the
limits
of
our
capacity
so
as
to
understand
any
one
supernatural
thing
which
is
above
or
beyond
the
power
of
our
natures
we
might
by
that
rule
as
well
understand
all
things
and
thus
by
breaking
over
the
confines
of
finite
nature
and
the
rank
of
being
which
we
hold
in
the
universe
comprehend
the
knowledge
of
infinity
from
hence
we
infer
that
every
kind
and
degree
ef
apprehension
reflection
and
understanding
which
we
can
attain
to
in
any
state
of
improvement
whatever
is
no
more
supernatural
than
the
nature
of
man
from
whence
perception
and
understanding
is
produced
may
be
supposed
to
be
so
nor
has
or
could
god
almighty
ever
have
revealed
himself
to
mankind
in
any
other
way
or
manner
but
what
is
truly
natural
secton
ii
containing
observations
on
the
providence
and
agency
of
god
as
it
respects
the
natural
and
moral
world
with
strictures
on
revelation
in
general
the
idea
of
a
god
we
infer
from
our
experimental
dependence
on
something
superior
to
ourselves
in
wisdom
power
and
goodness
which
we
call
god
our
senses
discover
to
us
the
works
of
god
which
we
call
nature
and
which
is
a
manifest
demonstration
of
his
invisible
essence
thus
it
is
from
the
works
of
nature
that
we
deduce
the
knowledge
of
a
god
and
not
because
we
have
or
can
have
any
immediate
knowledge
of
or
revelation
from
him
but
on
the
other
hand
all
our
understanding
of
or
intelligence
from
god
is
communicated
to
us
by
the
intervention
of
natural
causes
which
is
not
of
the
divine
essence
this
we
denominate
to
be
natural
revelation
for
that
it
is
mediately
made
known
to
us
by
our
senses
and
from
our
sensations
of
external
objects
in
general
so
that
all
and
every
part
of
the
universe
of
which
we
have
any
conception
is
exterior
from
the
nature
or
essence
of
god
nor
is
it
in
the
nature
of
things
possible
for
us
to
receive
or
for
god
to
communicate
any
inspiration
or
revelation
to
us
but
by
the
instrumentality
of
intermediate
causes
as
has
been
before
observed
therefore
all
our
notions
of
the
immediate
interposition
of
divine
illuminations
inspiration
or
infusion
of
ideas
or
revelations
into
our
minds
is
mere
enthusiasm
and
deception
for
that
neither
the
divine
mind
nor
those
of
any
finite
intelligences
can
make
any
representation
to
or
impression
on
our
external
senses
without
the
assistance
of
some
adequate
intermediate
cause
the
same
is
the
case
between
man
and
man
or
with
mankind
in
general
we
can
no
otherwise
hold
a
correspondence
but
by
the
aptitude
and
through
the
medium
of
our
senses
since
this
is
the
only
possible
way
in
nature
by
which
we
can
receive
any
notices
perceptions
or
intelligence
from
god
or
man
nothing
can
be
more
unreasonable
than
to
suppose
because
god
is
infinitely
powerful
that
he
can
therefore
inspire
or
infuse
perception
reflection
or
revelation
into
the
mind
of
man
in
such
a
way
or
manner
as
is
incompatible
with
the
aptitudes
and
powers
of
their
nature
such
a
revelation
would
be
as
impossible
to
be
revealed
by
god
as
by
a
mere
creature
for
though
it
is
a
maxim
of
truth
that
with
god
all
things
are
possible
yet
it
should
be
considered
that
contradictions
and
consequently
impossibilities
are
not
comprehended
in
the
definition
of
things
but
are
diametrically
the
reverse
of
them
as
may
be
seen
in
the
definition
of
the
word
things
to
wit
whatever
is
there
is
no
contradiction
in
nature
or
truth
which
comprehends
or
contains
all
things
therefore
the
maxim
is
just
that
with
god
all
things
are
possible
viz
all
things
in
nature
are
possible
with
god
but
contradictions
are
falsehoods
which
have
no
positive
existence
but
are
the
negatives
to
things
or
to
nature
which
comprehends
whatever
is
so
that
contradictions
are
opposed
to
nature
and
truth
and
are
no
things
but
the
chimeras
of
weak
unintelligent
minds
who
make
false
application
of
things
to
persons
or
ascribe
such
powers
qualities
dispositions
and
aptitudes
to
things
as
nature
never
invested
them
with
such
are
our
deluded
notions
of
the
immediate
operations
of
the
holy
spirit
or
of
any
mere
spirit
on
our
minds
independent
of
the
intervention
of
some
adequate
natural
or
intermediate
cause
to
make
a
triangle
four
square
or
to
make
a
variety
of
mountains
contiguously
situated
without
vallies
or
to
give
existence
to
a
thing
and
not
to
give
existence
to
it
at
the
same
time
or
to
reveal
anything
to
us
incompatible
with
our
capacity
of
receiving
the
perception
of
it
pertains
to
those
negatives
to
nature
and
truth
and
are
not
things
revealed
nor
have
they
any
positive
existence
as
has
been
before
argued
for
they
are
inconsistent
with
themselves
and
the
relations
and
effects
which
they
are
supposed
to
have
upon
and
with
each
other
it
derogates
nothing
from
the
power
and
absolute
perfection
of
god
that
he
can
not
make
both
parts
of
a
contradiction
to
be
true
but
let
us
reverse
the
position
concerning
revelation
and
premise
that
it
is
accommodated
to
our
capacity
of
receiving
and
understanding
it
and
in
this
case
it
would
be
natural
and
therefore
possible
for
us
to
receive
and
understand
it
for
the
same
truth
which
is
predicated
on
the
sufficiency
of
our
capacity
to
receive
and
understand
a
revelation
affirms
at
the
same
time
the
possibility
of
our
receiving
and
understanding
it
but
to
suppose
that
god
can
make
both
parts
of
a
contradiction
to
be
true
to
reveal
and
not
reveal
would
be
the
same
as
ascribing
a
falsehood
to
him
and
to
call
it
by
the
name
of
power
that
god
can
do
anything
and
everything
that
is
consonant
to
his
moral
perfections
and
which
does
not
imply
a
contradiction
to
the
nature
of
the
things
themselves
and
the
essential
relation
which
they
bear
to
each
other
none
will
dispute
but
to
suppose
that
inasmuch
as
god
is
he
can
therefore
do
everything
which
we
in
our
ignorance
of
nature
or
of
moral
fitness
may
ascribe
to
him
without
understanding
whether
it
is
either
consonant
to
moral
rectitude
or
to
the
nature
of
the
things
themselves
and
the
immutable
relations
and
connections
which
they
bear
to
each
other
or
not
is
great
weakness
and
folly
that
god
can
not
in
the
exercise
of
his
providence
or
moral
government
counteract
the
perfections
of
his
nature
or
do
any
manner
of
injustice
is
manifestly
certain
nor
is
it
possible
for
god
to
effect
a
contradiction
in
the
natural
world
any
more
than
in
the
moral
the
impossibility
of
the
one
results
from
the
moral
perfections
of
god
and
the
impossibility
of
the
other
from
the
immutable
properties
qualities
relations
and
nature
of
the
things
themselves
as
in
the
instances
of
the
mountains
vallies
before
alluded
to
and
in
numberless
other
such
like
cases
admitting
a
revelation
to
be
from
god
it
must
be
allowed
to
be
infallible
therefore
those
to
whom
it
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
first
revealed
from
god
must
have
had
an
infallible
certainty
of
their
inspiration
so
likewise
the
rest
of
mankind
to
whom
it
is
proposed
as
a
divine
law
or
rule
of
duty
should
have
an
infallible
certainty
that
its
first
promulgators
were
thus
truly
inspired
by
the
immediate
interposition
of
the
spirit
of
god
and
that
the
revelation
has
been
preserved
through
all
the
changes
and
revolutions
of
the
world
to
their
time
and
that
the
copies
extant
present
them
with
its
original
inspiration
and
unerring
composure
or
are
perfectly
agreeable
to
it
all
this
we
must
have
an
infallible
certainty
of
or
we
fail
of
an
infallible
certainty
of
revelation
and
are
liable
to
be
imposed
upon
by
impostors
or
by
ignorant
and
insidious
teachers
whose
interest
it
may
be
to
obtrude
their
own
systems
on
the
world
for
infallible
truth
as
in
the
instance
of
mahomet
but
let
us
consult
our
own
constitutions
and
the
world
in
which
we
live
and
we
shall
find
that
inspiration
is
in
the
very
nature
of
things
impossible
to
be
understood
by
us
and
of
consequence
not
in
fact
true
what
certainty
can
we
have
of
the
agency
of
the
divine
mind
on
ours
or
how
can
we
distinguish
the
supposed
divine
illuminations
or
ideas
from
those
of
our
own
which
are
natural
to
us
in
order
for
us
to
be
certain
of
the
interposition
of
immediate
divine
inspiration
in
our
minds
we
must
be
able
to
analyze
distinguish
and
distinctly
separate
the
premised
divine
reflections
illuminations
or
inspiration
from
our
own
natural
cogitations
for
otherwise
we
should
be
liable
to
mistake
our
reflections
and
reasonings
for
god
inspiration
as
is
the
case
with
enthusiasts
or
fanatics
and
thus
impose
on
ourselves
and
obtrude
our
romantic
notions
on
mankind
as
god
revelation
none
will
it
is
presumed
pretend
that
the
natural
reflections
of
our
minds
are
dictated
by
the
immediate
agency
of
the
divine
spirit
for
if
they
were
thus
dictated
they
would
be
of
equal
authority
with
any
supposed
inspired
revelation
how
then
shall
we
be
able
to
distinguish
or
understand
our
natural
perceptions
reflections
or
reasonings
from
any
premised
immediately
inspired
ones
should
god
make
known
to
us
or
to
any
of
us
a
revelation
by
a
voice
and
that
in
a
language
which
we
understand
and
admitting
that
the
propositions
doctrines
or
subject
matter
of
it
should
not
exceed
our
capacity
we
could
understand
it
the
same
as
we
do
in
conversation
with
one
another
but
this
would
be
an
external
and
natural
revelation
in
which
god
is
supposed
to
make
use
of
language
grammar
logic
and
sound
alias
of
intermediate
causes
in
order
to
communicate
or
reveal
it
which
would
differ
as
much
from
an
immediately
inspired
revelation
as
this
book
may
be
supposed
to
do
for
the
very
definition
of
immediate
inspiration
precludes
all
natural
or
immediate
causes
that
god
is
eternally
perfect
in
knowledge
and
therefore
knows
all
things
not
by
succession
or
by
parts
as
we
understand
things
by
degrees
has
been
already
evinced
nevertheless
all
truth
which
we
arrive
at
the
understanding
of
accords
with
the
divine
omniscience
but
we
do
not
come
at
the
comprehension
of
things
by
immediate
infusion
or
inspiration
but
from
reasoning
for
we
can
not
see
or
hear
god
think
or
reason
any
more
than
man
nor
are
our
senses
susceptible
of
a
mere
mental
communion
with
him
nor
is
it
in
nature
possible
for
the
human
mind
to
receive
any
instantaneous
or
immediate
illuminations
or
ideas
from
the
divine
spirit
as
before
argued
but
we
must
illuminate
and
improve
our
minds
by
a
close
application
to
the
study
of
nature
through
the
series
whereof
god
has
been
pleased
to
reveal
himself
to
man
so
that
we
may
truly
say
that
the
knowledge
of
nature
is
the
revelation
of
god
in
this
there
can
be
no
delusion
it
is
natural
and
could
come
from
none
other
but
god
unless
we
could
do
this
we
should
compound
them
together
at
a
venture
and
form
a
revelation
like
nebuchadnezzar
idol
partly
iron
and
partly
clay
alias
partly
divine
and
partly
human
the
apostle
paul
informs
us
that
sometimes
he
spake
and
not
the
lord
and
at
other
times
speaks
doubtfully
about
the
matter
saying
and
i
think
also
that
i
have
the
spirit
of
god
and
if
he
was
at
a
loss
about
his
inspiration
well
may
we
be
distrustful
of
it
from
the
foregoing
speculations
on
the
subject
of
supernatural
inspiration
it
appears
that
there
are
insuperable
difficulties
in
a
mere
mental
discourse
with
the
divine
spirit
it
is
what
we
are
unacquainted
with
and
the
law
of
our
nature
forbids
it
our
method
of
conversation
is

by
some

of
external

which
are
the
mediate
ground
of
it
and
we
are
liable
to
errors
and
mistakes
in
this
natural
and
external
way
of
correspondence

when
we
have
the
vanity
to
rely
on
dreams
and
visions
to
inform
ourselves
of
things
or
attempt
to
commune
with
invisible
finite
beings
or
with
the
holy
spirit
our
deceptions
blunders
and
confusions
are
increased
to
fanaticism
itself
as
the
diverse
supposed
influence
of
the
spirit
on
the
respective
sectaries
even
among
christians
may
witness
as
it
manifestly
in
their
empty
conceit
of
it
conforms
to
every
of
their
traditions
which
evinces
that
the
whole
bustle
of
it
is
mere
enthusiasm
for
was
it
dictated
by
the
spirit
of
truth
and
uniformity
itself
it
would
influence
all
alike
however
zealots
persuade
themselves
and
one
another
that
they
have
supernatural
communion
with
the
holy
ghost
from
whence
they
tell
us
they
derive
their
notions
of
religion
and
in
their
frenzy
are
proof
against
reason
and
argument
which
if
we
tender
them
they
tell
us
that
it
is
carnal
and
depraved
reasoning
but
that
their
teachings
are
immediately
from
god
and
then
proceed
to
vent
upon
us
all
the
curses
and
punishments
which
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
there
has
in
the
different
parts
and
ages
of
the
world
been
a
multiplicity
of
immediate
and
wonderful
discoveries
said
to
have
been
made
to
godly
men
of
old
by
the
special
illumination
or
supernatural
inspiration
of
god
every
of
which
have
in
doctrine
precept
and
instruction
been
essentially
different
from
each
other
which
are
consequently
as
repugnant
to
truth
as
the
diversity
of
the
influence
of
the
spirit
on
the
multiplicity
of
sectaries
has
been
represented
to
be
these
facts
together
with
the
premises
and
inferences
as
already
deduced
are
too
evident
to
be
denied
and
operate
conclusively
against
immediate
or
supernatural
revelation
in
general
nor
will
such
revelation
hold
good
in
theory
any
more
than
in
practice
was
a
revelation
to
be
made
known
to
us
it
must
be
accommodated
to
our
external
senses
and
also
to
our
reason
so
that
we
could
come
at
the
perception
and
understanding
of
it
the
same
as
we
do
to
that
of
things
in
general
we
must
perceive
by
our
senses
before
we
can
reflect
with
the
mind
our
sensorium
is
that
essential
medium
between
the
divine
and
human
mind
through
which
god
reveals
to
man
the
knowledge
of
nature
and
is
our
only
door
of
correspondence
with
god
or
with
man
a
premised
revelation
adapted
to
our
external
senses
would
enable
our
mental
powers
to
reflect
upon
examine
into
and
understand
it
always
provided
nevertheless
that
the
subject
matter
of
such
revelation
or
that
of
the
doctrines
precepts
or
injunctions
therein
contained
do
not
exceed
our
reason
but
are
adapted
to
it
as
well
as
to
our
external
senses
to
suppose
that
god
merely
from
his
omnipotence
without
the
intervention
of
some
adequate
intermediate
cause
could
make
use
of
sound
or
grammatical
and
logical
language
or
of
writing
so
as
to
correspond
with
us
or
to
reveal
any
thing
to
us
would
run
into
the
same
sort
of
absurdity
which
we
have
already
confuted
for
it
is
the
same
as
to
suppose
an
effect
without
a
suitable
or
a
proportionable
cause
or
an
effect
without
a
cause
whereas
effects
must
have
adequate
causes
or
they
could
not
be
produced
god
is
the
and
eternal
cause
of
all
things
but
the
eternal
cause
can
no
otherwise
operate
on
the
eternal
succession
of
causes
and
effects
but
by
the
mutual
operation
of
those
causes
on
each
other
according
to
the
fixed
laws
of
nature
for
as
we
have
frequently
observed
before
that
of
all
possible
systems
infinite
wisdom
comprehended
the
best
and
infinite
goodness
and
power
must
have
adopted
and
perfected
it
and
being
once
established
into
an
ordinance
of
nature
it
could
not
be
deviated
from
by
god
for
that
it
would
necessarily
imply
a
manifest
imperfection
in
god
either
in
its
eternal
establishment
or
in
its
premised
subsequent
alteration
which
will
be
more
particularly
considered
in
the
next
chapter
to
suppose
that
almighty
power
could
produce
a
voice
language
grammar
or
logic
so
as
to
communicate
a
revelation
to
us
without
some
sort
of
organic
or
instrumentated
machine
or
intermediate
vehicle
or
adequate
constituted
external
cause
would
imply
a
contradiction
to
the
order
of
nature
and
consequently
to
the
perfection
of
god
who
established
it
therefore
provided
god
has
ever
given
us
any
particular
revelation
we
must
suppose
that
he
has
made
use
of
a
regular
and
natural
constituted
and
mediate
cause
comprehended
in
the
external
order
of
nature
rightly
fitted
and
abilitated
to
make
use
of
the
vocal
power
of
language
which
comprises
that
of
characters
orthography
grammar
and
logic
all
which
must
have
been
made
use
of
in
communicating
a
supposed
revelation
to
mankind
which
forecloses
inspiration
furthermore
this
heavenly
dictating
voice
should
have
been
accommodated
to
all
languages
grammars
and
logical
ways
of
speaking
in
which
a
revelation
may
have
been
divulged
as
it
would
be
needful
to
have
been
continued
from
the
beginning
to
every
receiver
compiler
translator
printer
commentator
on
and
teacher
of
such
revelation
in
order
to
have
informed
mankind
in
every
instance
wherein
at
any
time
they
may
have
been
imposed
upon
by
any
spurious
adulterations
or
interpolations
and
how
it
was
in
the
original
these
with
the
refinements
of
languages
and
translations
are
a
summary
of
the
many
ways
wherein
we
may
have
been
deceived
by
giving
credit
to
antiquated
written
revelation
which
would
need
a
series
of
miracles
to
promulgate
and
perpetuate
it
in
the
world
free
from
mistakes
and
frauds
of
one
kind
or
other
and
which
leads
me
to
the
consideration
of
the
doctrine
of
miracles
chapter
vi
secton
i
of
miracles
previous
to
the
arguments
concerning
miracles
it
is
requisite
that
we
give
a
definition
of
them
that
the
arguments
may
be
clearly
opposed
to
the
doctrine
of
miracles
the
reality
of
which
we
mean
to
negative
so
that
we
do
not
dispute
about
matters
in
which
we
are
all
agreed
but
that
we
may
direct
our
speculations
to
the
subject
matter
or
essence
of
the
controversy
we
will
therefore
premise
that
miracles
are
opposed
to
and
counteract
the
laws
of
nature
or
that
they
imply
an
absolute
alteration
in
either
a
greater
or
less
degree
the
eternal
order
disposition
and
tendency
of
it
this
we
conclude
is
a
just
definition
of
miraculousness
and
is
that
for
which
the
advocates
for
miracles
contend
in
their
defining
of
miracles
for
if
they
were
supposed
to
make
no
alteration
in
the
natural
order
of
things
they
could
have
no
positive
existence
but
the
laws
of
nature
would
produce
their
effects
which
would
preclude
their
reality
and
render
them
altogether
fictitious
inasmuch
as
their
very
existence
is
premised
to
consist
in
their
opposition
to
and
alteration
of
the
laws
of
nature
so
that
if
this
is
not
effected
miracles
can
have
no
positive
existence
any
more
than
nonentity
itself
therefore
if
in
the
course
of
the
succeeding
arguments
we
should
evince
that
the
laws
of
nature
have
not
and
can
not
be
perverted
altered
or
suspended
it
will
foreclose
miracles
by
making
all
things
natural
having
thus
defined
miracles
and
stated
the
dispute
we
proceed
to
the
arguments
should
there
ever
have
been
a
miraculous
suspension
and
alteration
of
the
laws
of
nature
god
must
have
been
the
immediate
author
of
it
as
no
finite
beings
may
be
supposed
to
be
able
to
alter
those
laws
or
regulations
which
were
established
by
omnipotent
power
and
infinite
perfection
and
which
nothing
short
of
such
power
and
perfection
can
perpetuate
this
then
is
the
single
point
at
issue
viz
whether
god
has
or
can
consistent
with
his
nature
as
god
in
any
instance
whatever
alter
or
deviate
from
the
laws
with
which
he
has
eternally
impressed
the
universe
or
not
to
suppose
that
god
should
subvert
his
laws
which
is
the
same
as
changing
them
would
be
to
suppose
him
to
be
mutable
for
that
it
would
necessarily
imply
either
that
their
eternal
establishment
was
imperfect
or
that
a
premised
alteration
thereof
is
so
to
alter
or
change
that
which
is
absolutely
perfect
would
necessarily
make
it
cease
to
be
perfect
inasmuch
as
perfection
could
not
be
altered
for
the
better
but
for
the
worse
and
consequently
an
alteration
could
not
meet
with
the
divine
approbation
which
terminates
the
issue
of
the
matter
in
question
against
miracles
and
authorizes
us
to
deduce
the
following
conclusive
inference
to
wit
that
almighty
god
having
eternally
impressed
the
universe
with
a
certain
system
of
laws
for
the
same
eternal
reason
that
they
were
infinitely
perfect
and
best
they
could
never
admit
of
the
least
alteration
but
are
as
unchangeable
in
their
nature
as
god
their
immutable
author
to
form
the
foregoing
argument
into
syllogisms
it
would
be
thus
god
is
perfect
the
laws
of
nature
were
established
by
god
therefore
the
laws
of
nature
are
perfect
but
admitting
miracles
the
syllogism
should
be
thus
the
laws
of
nature
were
in
their
eternal
establishment
perfect
the
laws
of
nature
have
been
altered
therefore
the
alteration
of
the
laws
of
nature
is
imperfect
or
thus
the
laws
of
nature
have
been
altered
the
alteration
has
been
for
the
better
therefore
the
eternal
establishment
thereof
was
imperfect
thus
it
appears
from
a
syllogistical
as
well
as
other
methods
of
reasoning
that
provided
we
admit
of
miracles
which
are
synonymous
to
the
alterations
of
nature
we
by
so
doing
derogate
from
the
perfection
of
god
either
in
his
eternal
constitution
of
nature
or
in
a
supposed
subsequent
miraculous
alteration
of
it
so
that
take
the
argument
either
way
and
it
preponderates
against
miracles
furthermore
was
it
possible
that
the
eternal
order
of
nature
should
have
been
imperfect
there
would
be
an
end
to
all
perfection
for
god
might
be
as
imperfect
in
any
supposed
miraculous
works
as
in
those
of
nature
nor
could
we
ever
have
any
security
under
his
natural
or
moral
government
if
they
were
liable
to
change
for
mutability
is
but
another
term
for
imperfection
or
is
inseparably
connected
with
it
god
the
great
architect
of
nature
has
so
constructed
its
machinery
that
it
never
needs
to
be
altered
or
rectified
in
we
endeavor
to
search
out
the
hidden
mystery
of
a
perpetual
motion
in
order
to
copy
nature
for
after
all
our
researches
we
must
be
contented
with
such
mechanism
as
will
run
down
and
need
rectification
again
but
the
machine
of
the
universe
admits
of
no
rectification
but
continues
its
never
ceasing
operations
under
the
unerring
guidance
of
the
providence
of
god

architects

and
unmake
things
and
alter
them
as
their
invention
may
dictate
and

may
determine
to
be
most
convenient
and
best
but
that
mind
which
is
infinitely
perfect
gains
nothing
by
experience
but
surveys
the
immense
universality
of
things
with
all
their
possible
relations
fitnesses
and
unfitnesses
of

natural
or
moral
kind

view

a
succession
of
knowledge

of
the

incompatible
with

omniscience
or

and
the
eternal
and
infinite
display

any
subsequent
exertion
of
it
miraculously
that
creation
is
as
eternal
and
infinite
as
god
has
been
argued
in
chapter
second
and
that
there
could
be
no
succession
in
creation
or
the
exertion
of
the
power
of
god
in
perfecting
the
boundless
work
and
in
impressing
the
universe
with
harmonious
laws
perfectly
well
adapted
to
their
design
use
and
end
first
these
arguments
may
be
further
illustrated
and
the
evidence
of
the
being
of
a
god
more
fully
exhibited
from
the
following
considerations
to
wit
dependent
beings
and
existences
must
be
dependent
on
some
being
or
cause
that
is
independent
for
dependent
beings
or
existences
could
not
exist
independently
and
in
as
much
as
by
retrospectively
tracing
the
order
of
the
succession
of
causes
we
can
not
include
in
our
numeration
the
independent
cause
as
the
several
successive
causes
still
depend
on
their
preceding
cause
and
that
preceding
cause
on
the
cause
preceding
it
and
so
on
beyond
numerical
calculations
we
are
therefore
obliged
as
rational
beings
to
admit
an
independent
cause
of
all
things
for
that
a
mere
succession
of
dependent
causes
can
not
constitute
an
independent
cause
and
from
hence
we
are
obliged
to
admit
a
and
sufficient
cause
of
all
things
for
otherwise
it
would
be
dependent
and
insufficient
to
have
given
existence
to
itself
or
to
have
been
the
efficient
cause
of
all
things
having
thus
established
the
doctrine
of
a
and
consequently
cause
of
all
things
we
ascribe
an
eternal
existence
to
this
cause
of
all
causes
and
effects
whom
we
call
god
and
inasmuch
as
from
the
works
of
nature
it
is
manifest
that
god
is
possessed
of
almighty
power
we
from
hence
infer
his
eternal
existence
since
his
premised
existence
at
and
not
before
any
given
era
would
be
a
conclusive
objection
to
the
omnipotency
of
his
power
that
he
had
not
existed
before
or
eternally
for
as
god
is
a
being
and
almighty
as
before
argued
his
power
must
apply
to
his
own
existence
as
well
as
to
the
existence
of
things
in
general
and
therefore
if
he
did
not
eternally
exist
it
must
be
because
he
had
not
the
almighty
power
of
existence
in
himself
and
if
so
he
never
could
have
existed
at
all
so
that
god
must
have
eternally
existed
or
not
have
existed
at
all
and
inasmuch
as
the
works
of
nature
evince
his
positive
existence
and
as
he
could
not
be
dependent
on
the
power
will
or
pleasure
of
any
other
being
but
himself
for
his
existence
and
as
an
existence
in
time
would
be
a
contradiction
to
his
almighty
power
of
that
he
had
not
eternally
existed
therefore
his
existence
must
have
been
in
truth
eternal
although
it
is
to
us
incomprehensible
that
any
being
could
be
or
eternal
which
is
synonymous
yet
we
can
comprehend
that
any
being
that
is
not
and
eternal
and
dependent
and
finite
and
consequently
not
a
god
hence
we
infer
that
though
we
can
not
comprehend
the
true
god
by
reason
of
our
own
finiteness
yet
we
can
negatively
comprehend
that
an
imperfect
being
can
not
be
god
a
dependent
being
is
finite
and
therefore
imperfect
and
consequently
not
a
god
a
being
that
has
existed
at
a
certain
era
and
not
before
is
a
limited
one
for
beyond
his
era
he
was
not
and
therefore
finite
and
consequently
not
a
god
therefore
that
being
only
who
is
infinitely
perfect
and
eternal
is
the
true
god
and
if
eternally
and
infinitely
perfect
there
must
have
been
an
eternal
and
infinite
display
and
if
an
eternal
and
infinite
display
it
could
be
nothing
short
of
an
eternal
and
infinite
creation
and
providence
as
to
the
existence
of
a
god
previous
to
moses
era
of
the
first
work
he
does
not
inform
us
the
first
notice
he
gives
us
of
a
god

of
his
laborious
working
by
the

a
theory
of
creation

think
better
calculated

israelitish

but
the
devil
and
his
banditti
of
fiends
and
emissaries
fright
them
out
of
their

have
a
powerful
influence
in
plunging

into

and
also
in
continuing

therein
this
supposed
intercourse
between
mankind
and
those
infernal
beings
is
by
some
thought
to
be
miraculous
or
supernatural
while
others
laugh
at
all
the
stories
of
their
existence
concluding
them
to
be
mere
juggle
and
deception
craftily
imposed
on
the
credulous
who
are
always
gaping
after
something
marvellous
miraculous
or
supernatural
or
after
that
which
they
do
not
understand
and
are
awkward
and
unskilful
in
their
examination
into
nature
or
into
the
truth
or
reality
of
things
which
is
occasioned
partly
by
natural
imbecility
and
partly
by
indolence
and
inattention
to
nature
and
reason
that
any
magical
intercourse
or
correspondence
of
mere
spirits
with
mankind
is
contradictory
to
nature
and
consequently
impossible
has
been
argued
in
chapter
sixth
and
that
nothing
short
of
the
omnipotent
power
of
god
countermanding
his
eternal
order
of
nature
and
impressing
it
with
new
and
contrary
law
can
constitute
a
miracle
has
been
argued
in
this
and
is
an
effect
surpassing
the
power
of
mere
creatures
the
diabolical
nature
not
excepted
from
hence
we
infer
that
devils
can
not
work
miracles
inattention
to
reason
and
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
things
makes
many
of
mankind
give
credit
to
miracles
it
seems
that
by
this
marvellous
way
of
accounting
for
things
they
think
to
come
off
with
reputation
in
their
ignorance
for
if
nature
was
nothing
but
a
supernatural
whirligig
or
an
inconstant
and
irregular
piece
of
mechanism
it
would
reduce
all
learning
and
science
to
a
level
with
the
fanaticism
and
superstition
of
the
weak
and
credulous
and
put
the
wise
and
unwise
on
a
level
in
point
of
knowledge
as
there
would
not
on
this
thesis
be
any
regular
standard
in
nature
whereby
to
ascertain
the
truth
and
reality
of
things
what
is
called
is
by
some
people
thought
to
be
miraculous
astrological
calculations
of
nativities
lucky
and
unlucky
days
and
seasons
are
by
some
regarded
and
even
moles
on
the
surface
of
the
skin
are
thought
to
be
portentive
of
good
or
bad
fortune
the
swedish
laplanders
the
most
ignorant
mortals
in
europe
are
charged
with
being
conjurors
and
are
said
to
have
done
such
feats
by
the
magic
art
as
do
not
at
all
fall
far
short
of
miracles
that
they
will
give
the
sailors
such
winds
as
they
want
in
any
part
of
their
voyage
that
they
can
inflict
and
cure
diseases
at
any
distance
and
insure
people
of
success
in
their
undertakings
and
yet
they
are
just
such
poor
miserable
wretches
as
used
to
be
charged
with
witchcraft
here
viz
in
england
and
in
new
england
and
can
not
command
so
much
as
the
necessaries
of
life
and
indeed
none
but
very
credulous
and
ignorant
people
give
credit
to
such
fables
at
this
day
though
the
whole
world
seems
to
have
been
bewitched
in
believing
them
formerly
the
of
march
an
act
passed
in
the
parliament
of
great
britain
to
repeal
the
statute
of
i
entitled
an
act
against
conjuration
witchcraft
and
dealing
with
evil
and
wicked
spirits
and
to
repeal
an
act
in
scotland
entitled
amentis
witchcraft
it
is
but
years
since
the
supreme
legislature
became
apprized
of
the
natural
impossibility
of
any
magical
intercourse
between
mankind
and
evil
and
wicked
spirits
in
consequence
whereof
they
repealed
their
statute
laws
against
it
as
they
were
naturally
void
unnecessary
and
unworthy
of
their
legislative
restriction
for
that
such
a
crime
had
no
possible
existence
in
nature
and
therefore
could
not
be
acted
by
mankind
though
previous
to
the
repeal
of
those
laws
more
or
less
of
that
island
had
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
them
and
the
relations
of
those
imaginary
criminals
were
stamped
with
infamy
by
such
executions
which
had
the
sanction
of
law
alias
of
the
legislature
and
the
judges
and
in
which
many
learned
attorneys
have
demonstrated
the
turpitude
of
such
capital
offences
and
the
just
sanction
of
those
laws
in
extirpating
such
pests
of
society
from
the
earth
to
which
the
clergy
have
likewise
given
their
approbation
for
that
those
capital
transgressors
made
too
free
with
their
devils
furthermore
the
repeal
of
those
laws
as
far
as
the
wisdom
and
authority
of
the
british
parliament
may
be
supposed
to
go
abrogated
that
command
of
the
law
of
moses
which
saith
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
and
not
only
so
but
the
doctrine
of
the
impossibility
of
intercourse
or
of
dealing
with
wicked
spirits
forecloses
the
supposed
miraculous
casting
out
of
devils
of
which
we
have
sundry
chronicles
in
the
new
testament
but
to
return
to
the
annals
of
my
own
country
it
will
present
us
with
a
scene
of
superstition
in
the
magical
way
which
will
probably
equal
any
that
is
to
be
met
with
in
history
to
wit
the
salem
witchcraft
in
new
england
great
numbers
of
the
inhabitants
of
both
sexes
were
judicially
convicted
of
being
wizards
and
witches
and
executed
accordingly
some
of
whom
were
so
infatuated
with
the
delusion
that
at
their
execution
they
confessed
themselves
guilty
of
the
sorcery
for
which
they
were
indicted
nor
did
the
fanaticism
meet
with
a
check
until
some
of
the
first
families
were
accused
with
it
who
made
such
an
opposition
to
the
prosecutions
as
finally
to
put
an
end
to
any
further
execution
of
the
salemites
those
capital
offenders
suffered
in
consequence
of
certain
laws
which
by
way
of
derision
have
since
been
called
the
in
consequence
of
the
multiplicity
of
superstition
with
which
they
abounded
most
of
which
are
repealed
but
those
that
respect
sorcery
have
had
favorite
legislators
enough
to
keep
them
alive
and
in
force
to
this
day
i
recollect
an
account
of
prodigies
said
to
have
been
carried
on
by
the
romish
clergy
in
france
upon
which
his
most
christian
majesty
sent
one
of
his
officers
to
them
with
the
following
prohibition
to
wit
by
the
command
of
the
king
god
is
forbid
to
work
any
more
miracles
in
this
place
upon
which
the
marvellous
work
ceased
there
has
been
so
much
detection
of
the
artifice
juggle
and
imposture
of
the
pretenders
to
miracles
in
the
world
especially
in
such
parts
where
learning
and
science
have
prevailed
that
it
should
prompt
us
to
be
very
suspicious
of
the
reality
of
them
even
without
entering
into
any
lengthy
arguments
from
the
reason
and
nature
of
things
to
evince
the
utter
impossibility
of
their
existence
in
the
creation
and
providence
of
god
we
are
told
that
the
first
occasion
and
introduction
of
miracles
into
the
world
was
to
prove
the
divine
authority
of
revelation
and
the
mission
of
its
first
teachers
be
it
so
upon
this
plan
of
evincing
the
divinity
of
revelation
it
would
be
necessary
that
its
teachers
should
always
be
vested
with
the
power
of
working
miracles
so
that
when
their
authority
or
the
infallibility
of
the
revelation
which
they
should
teach
should
at
any
time
be
questioned
they
might
work
a
miracle
or
that
in
such
a
case
god
would
do
it
which
would
end
the
dispute
provided
mankind
were
supposed
to
be
judges
of
miracles
which
may
be
controverted
however
admitting
that
they
are
possible
and
mankind
in
the
several
generations
of
the
world
to
be
adequate
judges
of
them
and
also
that
they
were
necessary
to
support
the
divine
mission
of
the
first
promulgators
of
revelation
and
the
divinity
which
they
taught
from
the
same
parity
of
reasoning
miracles
ought
to
be
continued
to
the
succeeding
generations
of
mankind
with
its
divine
authority
or
that
of
its
teachers
for
why
should
we
in
this
age
of
the
world
be
under
obligation
to
believe
the
infallibility
of
revelation
or
the
heavenly
mission
of
its
teachers
upon
less
evidence
than
those
of
mankind
who
lived
in
the
generations
before
us
for
that
which
may
be
supposed
to
be
a
rational
evidence
and
worthy
to
gain
the
belief
and
assent
of
mankind
at
one
period
of
time
must
be
so
at
another
so
that
it
appears
from
the
sequel
of
the
arguments
on
this
subject
that
provided
miracles
were
requisite
to
establish
the
divine
authority
of
revelation
originally
it
is
equally
requisite
that
they
be
continued
to
the
latest
posterity
to
whom
the
divine
legislator
may
be
supposed
to
continue
such
revelation
as
his
law
to
mankind
nothing
is
more
evident
to
the
understanding
part
of
mankind
than
that
in
those
parts
of
the
world
where
learning
and
science
has
prevailed
miracles
have
ceased
but
in
such
parts
of
it
as
are
barbarous
and
ignorant
miracles
are
still
in
vogue
which
is
of
itself
a
strong
presumption
that
in
the
infancy
of
letters
learning
and
science
or
in
the
world
those
who
confided
in
miracles
as
a
proof
of
the
divine
mission
of
the
first
promulgators
of
revelation
were
imposed
upon
by
fictitious
appearances
instead
of
miracles
furthermore
the
author
of
christianity
warns
us
against
the
impositions
of
false
teachers
and
ascribes
the
signs
of
the
true
believers
saying
and
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe
in
my
name
shall
they
cast
out
devils
they
shall
speak
with
new
tongues
they
shall
take
up
serpents
and
if
they
drink
any
deadly
thing
it
shall
not
hurt
them
they
shall
lay
hands
on
the
sick
and
they
shall
recover
these
are
the
express
words
of
the
founder
of
christianity
and
are
contained
in
the
very
commission
which
he
gave
to
his
eleven
apostles
who
were
to
promulgate
his
gospel
in
the
world
so
that
from
their
very
institution
it
appears
that
when
the
miraculous
signs
therein
spoken
of
failed
they
were
considered
as
unbelievers
and
consequently
no
faith
or
trust
to
be
any
longer
reposed
in
them
or
their
successors
for
these
signs
were
those
which
were
to
perpetuate
their
mission
and
were
to
be
continued
as
the
only
evidences
of
the
validity
and
authenticity
of
it
and
as
long
as
these
signs
followed
mankind
could
not
be
deceived
in
adhering
to
the
doctrines
which
the
apostles
and
their
successors
taught
but
when
these
signs
failed
their
divine
authority
ended
now
if
any
of
them
will
drink
a
dose
of
deadly
poison
which
i
could
prepare
and
it
does
not
hurt
them
i
will
subscribe
to
their
divine
authority
and
end
the
dispute
not
that
i
have
a
disposition
to
poison
anyone
nor
do
i
suppose
that
they
would
dare
to
take
such
a
dose
as
i
could
prepare
for
them
which
if
so
would
evince
that
they
were
unbelievers
themselves
though
they
are
extremely
apt
to
censure
others
for
unbelief
which
according
to
their
scheme
is
a
damnable
sin
secton
iv
prayer
can
not
be
attended
with
miraculous
consequences
prayer
to
god
is
no
part
of
a
rational
religion
nor
did
reason
ever
dictate
it
but
was
it
duly
attended
to
it
would
teach
us
the
contrary
to
make
known
our
wants
to
god
by
prayer
or
to
communicate
any
intelligence
concerning
ourselves
or
the
universe
to
him
is
impossible
since
his
omniscient
mind
has
a
perfect
knowledge
of
all
things
and
therefore
is
beholden
to
none
of
our
correspondency
to
inform
himself
of
our
circumstances
or
of
what
would
be
wisest
and
best
to
do
for
us
in
all
possible
conditions
and
modes
of
existence
in
our
never
ending
duration
of
being
these
with
the
infinitude
of
things
have
been
eternally
deliberated
by
the
omniscient
mind
who
can
admit
of
no
additional
intelligence
whether
by
prayer
or
otherwise
which
renders
it
nugatory
we
ought
to
act
up
to
the
dignity
of
our
nature
and
demean
ourselves
as
creatures
of
our
rank
and
capacity
and
not
presume
to
dictate
any
thing
less
or
more
to
the
governor
of
the
universe
who
rules
not
by
our
proscriptions
but
by
eternal
and
infinite
reason
to
pray
to
god
or
to
make
supplication
to
him
requesting
certain
favors
for
ourselves
or
from
any
or
all
the
species
is
inconsistent
with
the
relation
which
subsists
between
god
and
man
whoever
has
a
just
sense
of
the
absolute
perfection
of
god
and
of
their
own
imperfection
and
natural
subjection
to
his
providence
can
not
but
from
thence
infer
the
impropriety
of
praying
or
supplicating
to
god
for
this
that
or
the
other
thing
or
of
remonstrating
against
his
providence
inasmuch
as
known
to
god
are
all
our
wants
and
as
we
know
that
we
ourselves
are
inadequate
judges
of
what
would
be
best
for
us
all
things
considered
god
looks
through
the
immensity
of
things
and
understands
the
harmony
moral
beauty
and
decorum
of
the
whole
and
will
by
no
means
change
his
purposes
or
alter
the
nature
of
the
things
themselves
for
any
of
our
entreaties
or
threats
to
pray
entreat
or
make
supplication
to
god
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
dictating
to
eternal
reason
and
entering
into
the
province
and
prerogative
of
the
almighty
if
this
is
not
the
meaning
and
import
of
prayer
it
has
none
at
all
that
extends
to
the
final
events
and
consequences
of
things
to
pray
to
god
with
a
sense
that
the
prayer
we
are
making
will
not
be
granted
any
more
for
our
making
it
or
that
our
prayer
will
make
no
alteration
in
the
state
order
or
disposal
of
things
at
all
or
that
the
requests
which
we
make
will
be
no
more
likely
to
be
granted
or
the
things
themselves
conferred
upon
us
by
god
than
as
though
we
had
not
prayed
for
them
would
be
stupidity
or
outright
mockery
or
to
be
seen
of
men
in
order
to
procure
from
them
some
temporary
advantages
but
on
the
other
hand
for
us
to
suppose
that
our
prayers
or
praises
do
in
any
one
instance
or
more
alter
the
eternal
constitution
of
things
or
of
the
providence
of
god
is
the
same
as
to
suppose
ourselves
so
far
forth
to
hold
a
share
in
the
divine
government
for
our
prayers
must
be
supposed
to
effect
something
or
nothing
if
they
effect
nothing
they
are
good
for
nothing
but
that
they
should
effect
any
alteration
in
the
nature
of
things
or
providence
of
god
is
inadmissible
for
if
they
did
we
should
interfere
with
the
providence
of
god
in
a
certain
degree
by
arrogating
it
to
ourselves
for
if
there
are
any
particulars
in
providence
which
god
does
not
govern
by
his
order
of
nature
they
do
not
belong
to
the
providence
of
god
but
of
man
for
if
in
any
instance
god
is
moved
by
the
prayers
entreaties
or
supplications
of
his
creatures
to
alter
his
providence
or
to
do
that
in
conformity
thereto
which
otherwise
in
the
course
of
his
providence
he
would
not
have
done
then
it
would
necessarily
follow
that
as
far
as
such
alteration
may
be
supposed
to
take
place
god
does
not
govern
by
eternal
and
infinite
reason
but
on
the
contrary
is
governed
himself
by
the
prayer
of
man
our
great
proficients
in
prayer
must
need
think
themselves
to
be
of
great
importance
in
the
scale
of
being
otherwise
they
would
not
indulge
themselves
in
the
notion
that
the
god
of
nature
would
subvert
his
laws
or
bend
his
providence
in
conformity
to
their
prayers
but
it
may
be
objected
that
they
pray
conditionally
to
wit
that
god
would
answer
their
prayers
provided
they
are
agreeable
to
his
providential
order
or
disposal
of
things
but
to
consider
prayer
in
such
a
sense
renders
it
not
only
useless
but
impertinent
for
the
laws
of
nature
would
produce
their
natural
effects
as
well
without
it
as
with
it
the
sum
total
of
such
conditional
prayer
could
amount
to
no
more
than
this
viz
that
god
would
not
regard
them
at
all
but
that
he
would
conduct
the
kingdom
of
his
providence
agreeable
to
the
absolute
perfections
of
his
nature
and
who
in
the
exercise
of
common
sense
would
imagine
that
god
would
do
otherwise
the
nature
of
the
immense
universality
of
things
having
been
eternally
adjusted
constituted
and
settled
by
the
profound
thought
perfect
wisdom
impartial
justice
immense
goodness
and
omnipotent
power
of
god
it
is
the
greatest
arrogance
in
us
to
attempt
an
alteration
thereof
if
we
demean
ourselves
worthy
of
a
rational
happiness
the
laws
of
the
moral
system
already
established
will
afford
it
to
us
and
as
to
physical
evils
prudent
economy
may
make
them
tolerable
or
ward
most
of
them
off
for
a
season
though
they
will
unavoidably
bring
about
the
separation
of
a
soul
and
body
and
terminate
with
animal
life
whether
we
pray
for
or
against
it
to
pray
for
any
thing
which
we
can
obtain
by
the
due
application
of
our
natural
powers
and
neglect
the
means
of
procuring
it
is
impertinence
and
laziness
in
the
abstract
and
to
pray
for
that
which
god
in
the
course
of
his
providence
has
put
out
of
our
power
to
obtain
is
only
murmuring
against
god
and
finding
fault
with
his
providence
or
acting
the
inconsiderate
part
of
a
child
for
example
to
pray
for
more
wisdom
understanding
grace
or
faith
for
a
more
robust
constitution
handsomer
figure
or
more
of
a
gigantic
size
would
be
the
same
as
telling
god
that
we
are
dissatisfied
with
our
inferiority
in
the
order
of
being
that
neither
our
souls
nor
bodies
suit
us
that
he
has
been
too
sparing
of
his
beneficence
that
we
want
more
wisdom
and
organs
better
fitted
for
show
agility
and
superiority
but
we
ought
to
consider
that
can
not
add
one
cubit
to
our
or
alter
the
construction
of
our
organic
frame
and
that
our
mental
talents
are
finite
and
that
in
a
vast
variety
of
proportions
and
disproportions
as
our
heavenly
father
in
his
order
of
nature
and
scale
of
being
saw
fit
who
has
nevertheless
for
the
encouragement
of
intelligent
nature
ordained
that
it
shall
be
capable
of
improvement
and
consequently
of
enlargement
therefore
lacketh
instead
of
it
of
let
him
improve
what
he
has
that
he
may
enlarge
the
original
stock
this
is
all
the
possible
way
of
gaining
in
wisdom
and
knowledge
a
competency
of
which
will
regulate
our
faith
but
it
is
too
common
for
great
faith
and
little
knowledge
to
unite
in
the
same
person
such
persons
are
beyond
the
reach
of
argument
and
their
faith
immovable
though
it
can
not
remove
mountains
the
only
way
to
procure
food
raiment
or
the
necessaries
or
conveniences
of
life
is
by
natural
means
we
do
not
get
them
by
wishing
or
praying
for
but
by
actual
exertion
and
the
only
way
to
obtain
virtue
or
morality
is
to
practice
and
habituate
ourselves
to
it
and
not
to
pray
to
god
for
it
he
has
naturally
furnished
us
with
talents
or
faculties
suitable
for
the
exercise
and
enjoyment
of
religion
and
it
is
our
business
to
improve
them
aright
or
we
must
suffer
the
consequences
of
it
we
should
conform
ourselves
to
reason
the
path
of
moral
rectitude
and
in
so
doing
we
can
not
fail
of
recommending
ourselves
to
god
and
to
our
own
consciences
this
is
all
the
religion
which
reason
knows
or
can
ever
approve
of
moses
the
celebrated
prophet
and
legislator
of
the
israelites
ingratiated
himself
into
their
esteem
by
the
stratagem
of
prayer
and
pretended
intimacy
with
god
he
acquaints
us
that
he
was
once
admitted
to
a
sight
of
his
and
that
man
can
see
his
face
and
and
at
other
times
we
are
told
that
he
with
god
face
to
face
as
a
man
talketh
with
his
and
also
that
at
times
god
waxed
wroth
with
israel
and
how
moses
prayed
for
them
and
at
other
times
that
he
ordered
aaron
to
offer
sweet
incense
to
god
which
his
and
prevented
his
destroying
israel
in
his
displeasure
these
are
the
footsteps
by
which
we
may
trace
sacerdotal
dominion
to
its
source
and
explore
its
progress
in
the
world
the
lord
said
unto
moses
how
long
will
this
people
provoke
me
i
will
smite
them
with
the
pestilence
and
disinherit
them
and
i
will
make
of
thee
a
great
nation
and
mightier
than
but
moses
advertises
god
of
the
injury
which
so
rash
a
procedure
would
do
to
his
character
among
the
nations
and
also
reminds
him
of
his
promise
to
israel
saying
if
thou
shall
kill
all
this
people
as
one
man
then
the
nations
which
have
heard
the
fame
of
thee
will
speak
saying
because
the
lord
was
not
able
to
bring
this
people
into
the
land
which
he
swear
unto
them
therefore
he
hath
slain
them
in
the
that
moses
should
thus
advise
the
omniscient
god
of
dishonorable
consequences
which
would
attend
a
breach
of
promise
which
he
tells
us
that
god
was
unadvisedly
about
to
make
with
the
tribes
of
israel
had
not
his
remonstrance
prevented
it
is
very
extraordinary
and
repugnant
to
reason
yet
to
an
eye
of
faith
it
would
exalt
the
man
moses
and
make
him
very
great
for
if
we
may
credit
his
history
of
the
matter
he
not
only
averted
god
judgment
against
israel
and
prevented
them
from
being
cut
off
as
a
nation
but
by
the
same
prayer
procured
for
them
a
pardon
of
their
sin
i
beseech
thee
the
iniquity
of
this
and
in
the
next
verse
follows
the
answer
the
lord
said
i
have
pardoned
according
to
thy
it
seems
that
god
had
the
power
but
moses
had
the
dictation
of
it
and
saved
israel
from
the
wrath
and
pestilential
fury
of
a
jealous
god
and
that
he
procured
them
a
pardon
of
their
sin
the
lord
thy
god
is
a
jealous
jealousy
can
have
no
existence
in
that
mind
which
possesses
perfect
knowledge
and
consequently
can
not
without
the
greatest
impropriety
he
ascribed
to
god
who
knows
all
things
and
needed
none
of
the
admonitions
advice
or
intelligence
of
moses
or
any
of
his
dictatorial
prayers
the
lard
hearkened
unto
me
at
that
time
intimating
that
it
was
a
common
thing
for
him
to
do
the
like
when
teachers
can
once
make
the
people
believe
that
god
answers
their
prayers
and
that
their
eternal
interest
is
dependent
on
them
they
soon
raise
themselves
to
opulency
rule
and
high
sounding
titles
as
that
of
holiness
the
reverend
father
in
god
the
holy
poker
bishop
of
and
a
variety
of
other
such
like
appellations
derogatory
to
the
honor
or
just
prerogative
of
god
as
is
joshua
history
concerning
the
lord
hearkening
unto
him
at
the
battle
of
the
amorites
wherein
he
informs
us
that
he
ordered
the
sun
to
stand
still
saying
stand
thou
still
upon
gidaen
and
thou
moon
in
the
valley
of
ajalon
so
the
sun
stood
still
and
the
moon
stayed
until
the
people
had
avenged
themselves
upon
their
enemies
so
the
sun
stood
still
in
the
midst
of
heaven
and
hasted
not
to
go
down
about
a
whole
day
and
then
adds
by
way
of
supremacy
to
himself
above
all
others
and
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
before
recited
passages
of
moses
concerning
the
lord
hearkening
unto
him
or
to
any
other
man
but
himself
saying
there
was
no
day
like
that
before
it
or
after
it
that
the
lord
hearkened
unto
the
voice
of
a
there
is
not
any
thing
more
evident
than
that
if
the
representation
given
by
joshua
as
matter
of
fact
is
true
those
exhibited
by
moses
concerning
the
lord
hearkening
unto
him
are
not
though
the
representations
of
fact
by
moses
and
by
joshua
are
allowed
to
be
both
canonical
yet
it
is
impossible
that
both
can
be
true
however
astronomy
being
but
little
understood
in
the
age
in
which
joshua
lived
and
the
earth
being
in
his
days
thought
to
be
at
rest
and
the
sun
to
revolve
round
it
makes
it
in
no
way
strange
that
he
caught
himself
by
ordering
the
sun
to
stand
still
which
having
since
been
discovered
to
have
been
the
original
fixed
position
of
that
luminous
body
eclipses
the
miraculous
interposition
of
joshua
furthermore
if
we
but
reflect
that
on
that
very
day
israel
vanquished
the
amorites
with
a
great
slaughter
chased
them
along
the
way
that
goeth
to
bethoron
and
smote
them
to
azekah
and
unto
in
so
great
a
hurry
of
war
clashing
of
arms
exasperation
and
elevation
of
mind
in
consequence
of
such
triumphant
victory
they
could
make
but
a
partial
observation
on
the
length
of
the
day
and
being
greatly
elated
with
such
an
extraordinary
day
work
joshua
took
the
advantage
of
it
and
told
them
that
it
was
an
uncommon
day
for
duration
that
he
had
interposed
in
the
system
and
prescribed
to
the
sun
to
stand
still
about
a
whole
day
and
that
they
had
two
days
time
to
accomplish
those
great
feats
the
belief
of
such
a
miraculous
event
to
have
taken
place
in
the
solar
system
in
consequence
of
the
influence
which
joshua
insinuated
that
he
had
with
god
would
most
effectually
establish
his
authority
among
the
people
for
if
god
would
hearken
to
his
voice
well
might
man
this
is
the
cause
why
the
bulk
of
mankind
in
all
ages
and
countries
of
the
world
have
been
so
much
infatuated
by
their
ghostly
teachers
whom
they
have
ever
imagined
to
have
had
a
special
influence
with
god
almighty
chapter
vii
secton
i
the
vagueness
and
unintelligibleness
of
the
prophecies
render
them
incapable
of
proving
revelation
prophecy
is
by
some
thought
to
be
miraculous
and
by
others
to
be
supernatural
and
there
are
others
who
indulge
themselves
in
an
opinion
that
they
amount
to
no
more
than
mere
political
conjectures
some
nations
have
feigned
an
intercourse
with
good
spirits
by
the
art
of
divination
and
others
with
evil
ones
by
the
art
of
magic
and
most
nations
have
pretended
to
an
intercourse
with
the
world
of
spirits
both
ways
the
romans
trusted
much
to
their
sibylline
oracles
and
soothsayers
the
babylonians
to
their
magicians
and
astrologers
the
egyptians
and
persians
to
their
magicians
and
the
jews
to
their
seers
or
prophets
and
all
nations
and
individuals
discover
an
anxiety
for
an
intercourse
with
the
world
of
spirits
which
lays
a
foundation
for
artful
and
designing
men
to
impose
upon
them
but
if
the
foregoing
arguments
in
chapter
sixth
respecting
the
natural
impossibility
of
an
intercourse
of
any
unbodied
or
imperceptible
mental
beings
with
mankind
are
true
then
the
foretelling
of
future
events
can
amount
to
nothing
more
than
political
illusion
for
prophecy
as
well
as
all
other
sorts
of
prognostication
must
be
inspired
or
it
could
be
no
more
than
judging
of
future
events
from
mere
probability
or
as
the
astronomers
ingenuously
confess
in
their
calculations
by
saying
judgment
of
the
weather
so
also
respecting
astrology
provided
there
is
any
such
thing
as
futurity
to
be
learned
from
it
it
would
be
altogether
a
natural
discovery
for
neither
astronomy
nor
astrology
claim
anything
of
a
miraculous
or
supernatural
kind
but
their
calculations
are
meant
to
be
predicated
on
the
order
and
course
of
nature
with
which
our
senses
are
conversant
and
with
which
inspiration
or
the
mere
cooperation
of
spirits
is
not
intended
to
act
as
part
so
also
concerning
prophecy
if
it
be
considered
to
be
merely
natural
we
will
not
at
present
dispute
whether
it
is
true
or
false
upon
this
position
it
stands
on
the
footing
of
probability
or
mere
conjecture
and
uncertainty
but
as
to
the
doctrine
of
any
supernatural
agency
of
the
divine
mind
on
ours
which
is
commonly
called
inspiration
it
has
been
sufficiently
confuted
in
chapter
sixth
which
arguments
need
not
be
repeated
nor
does
it
concern
my
system
to
settle
the
question
whether
prophecy
should
be
denominated
miraculous
or
supernatural
inasmuch
as
both
these
doctrines
have
been
confuted
though
it
is
my
opinion
that
were
we
to
trace
the
notion
of
supernatural
to
its
source
it
would
finally
terminate
in
that
which
is
denominated
miraculous
for
that
which
is
above
or
beyond
nature
if
it
has
any
positive
existence
must
be
miraculous
the
writings
of
the
prophets
are
most
generally
so
loose
vague
and
indeterminate
in
their
meaning
or
in
the
grammar
of
their
present
translation
that
the
prophecies
will
as
well
answer
to
events
in
one
period
of
time
as
in
another
and
are
equally
applicable
to
a
variety
of
events
which
have
and
are
still
taking
place
in
the
world
and
are
liable
to
so
many
different
interpretations
that
they
are
incapable
of
being
understood
or
explained
except
upon
arbitrary
principles
and
therefore
can
not
be
admitted
as
a
proof
of
revelation
as
for
instance
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
last
days
saith
god
who
can
understand
the
accomplishment
of
the
prophecies
that
are
expressed
after
this
sort
for
every
day
in
its
turn
has
been
and
will
in
its
succession
be
the
last
day
and
if
we
advert
to
the
express
words
of
the
prophecy
to
wit
last
there
will
be
an
uncertain
plurality
last
which
must
be
understood
to
be
short
of
a
month
or
a
year
or
it
should
have
been
expressed
thus
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
last
months
or
years
instead
of
days
and
if
it
had
mentioned
last
years
it
would
be
a
just
construction
to
suppose
that
it
included
a
less
number
of
years
than
a
century
but
as
the
prophecy
mentions
we
are
at
a
loss
which
among
the
plurality
of
them
to
assign
for
the
fulfilling
of
the
prophecy
furthermore
we
can
not
learn
from
the
prophecy
in
what
month
year
or
any
other
part
of
duration
those
last
days
belong
so
that
we
can
never
tell
when
such
vague
prophecies
are
to
take
place
they
therefore
remain
the
arbitrary
prerogative
of
fanatics
to
prescribe
their
events
in
any
age
or
period
of
time
when
their
distempered
fancies
may
think
most
eligible
there
are
other
prophecies
still
more
abstruse
to
wit
one
said
unto
the
man
clothed
in
linen
which
was
upon
the
waters
of
the
river
how
long
shall
it
be
to
the
end
of
these
wonders
and
i
heard
the
man
clothed
in
linen
which
was
upon
the
waters
of
the
river
when
he
held
up
his
right
hand
and
his
left
hand
unto
heaven
and
sware
by
him
that
liveth
forever
that
it
should
be
for
an
time
times
and
an
the
question
in
the
prophecy
is
asked
how
long
shall
it
be
to
the
end
of
these
wonders
and
the
answer
is
given
with
the
solemnity
of
an
oath
shall
be
for
a
time
times
and
a
a
time
is
an
indefinite
part
of
duration
and
so
are
times
and
the
third
description
of
time
is
as
indefinite
as
either
of
the
former
descriptions
of
it
to
wit
and
an
half
that
is
to
say
half
a
time
there
is
no
certain
term
given
in
any
or
either
of
the
three
descriptions
of
the
end
of
the
wonders
alluded
to
whereby
any
or
all
of
them
together
are
capable
of
computation
as
there
is
no
certain
period
marked
out
to
begin
or
end
a
calculation
to
compute
an
indefinite
time
in
the
single
number
or
quantity
of
duration
is
impossible
and
to
compute
an
uncertain
plurality
of
such
indefinite
times
is
equally
perplexing
and
impracticable
and
lastly
to
define
half
a
time
by
any
possible
succession
of
its
parts
is
a
contradiction
for
half
a
time
includes
no
time
at
all
inasmuch
as
the
smallest
conception
or
possible
moment
or
criterion
of
duration
is
a
time
or
otherwise
by
the
addition
of
ever
so
many
of
those
parts
together
they
would
not
prolong
a
period
so
that
there
is
not
and
can
not
be
such
a
part
of
time
as
half
a
time
for
be
it
supposed
to
be
ever
so
momentous
yet
if
includes
any
part
of
duration
it
is
a
time
and
not
half
a
time
had
the
prophet
said
half
a
year
half
a
day
or
half
a
minute
he
would
have
spoken
intelligibly
but
half
a
time
has
no
existence
at
all
and
consequently
no
period
could
ever
possibly
arrive
in
the
succession
or
order
of
time
when
there
could
be
an
end
to
the
wonders
alluded
to
and
in
this
sense
only
the
prophecy
is
intelligible
to
wit
that
it
will
never
come
to
pass
the
revelation
of
john
the
divine
involves
the
subject
of
time
if
possible
in
still
greater
inconsistencies
viz
to
the
woman
was
given
two
wings
of
a
great
eagle
that
she
might
fly
into
the
wilderness
into
her
place
where
she
is
nourished
for
a
time
and
times
and
half
a
time
and
the
angel
which
i
saw
stand
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
earth
lifted
up
his
hands
to
heaven
and
sware
by
him
that
liveth
forever
and
ever
who
created
heaven
and
the
things
that
therein
are
and
the
earth
and
the
things
that
therein
are
and
the
sea
and
the
things
which
are
therein
that
there
should
be
time
no
had
this
tremendous
oath
been
verified
there
could
have
been
no
farther
disputations
on
the
calculation
of
and
times
and
half
a
or
about
any
thing
else
for
its
succession
would
have
reached
its
last
and
final
period
at
that
important
crisis
when
time
should
have
been
no
longer
the
solar
system
must
have
ceased
its
motions
from
which
we
compute
the
succession
of
time
and
the
race
of
man
would
have
been
extinct
for
as
long
as
they
may
be
supposed
to
exist
time
must
of
necessary
consequence
have
existed
also
and
since
the
course
of
nature
including
the
generations
of
mankind
has
been
continued
from
the
time
of
the
positive
denunciation
of
the
angel
to
this
day
we
may
safely
conclude
that
his
interference
in
the
system
of
nature
was
perfectly
romantic
the
apostle
peter
at
the
first
christian
pentecost
objecting
to
the
accusation
of
their
being
drunk
with
new
wine
explains
the
prophecy
of
the
prophet
joel
who
prophesied
of
the
events
which
were
to
take
place
in
the
last
days
as
coming
to
pass
at
that
early
period
his
words
are
handed
down
to
us
as
follows
this
is
that
which
is
spoken
by
the
prophet
joel
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
last
days
saith
god
that
i
will
pour
out
my
spirit
upon
all
flesh
and
your
sons
and
your
daughters
shall
prophecy
and
your
young
men
shall
see
visions
and
your
old
men
shall
dream
the
history
of
the
of
the
spirit
at
the
pentecost
admitting
it
to
have
been
a
fact
would
have
been
very
inadequate
to
the
prophetical
prediction
viz
i
will
pour
out
my
spirit
upon
all
flesh
the
most
favorable
construction
is
that
the
prophet
meant
human
flesh
all
human
flesh
but
instead
of
a
universal
effusion
of
the
spirit
it
appears
to
have
been
restricted
to
a
select
number
who
were
collected
together
at
jerusalem
and
the
concourse
of
spectators
thought
them
to
be
delirious
it
may
however
be
supposed
that
peter
was
a
better
judge
of
the
accomplishment
of
the
prophecy
than
i
am
well
then
admitting
his
application
of
the
prophecy
of
the
last
days
to
take
place
at
the
first
pentecost
it
being
now
more
than
seventeen
hundred
years
ago
they
consequently
could
not
have
been
the
last
days
still
a
query
arises
whether
every
of
the
prophecies
which
were
predicted
to
be
fulfilled
in
the
last
days
must
not
have
been
accomplished
at
that
time
or
whether
any
of
the
prophecies
thus
expressed
are
still
to
be
completed
by
any
events
which
may
in
future
take
place
or
by
any
which
have
taken
place
since
those
last
days
called
pentecost
or
whether
any
prophecy
whatever
can
be
fulfilled
more
than
once
and
if
so
how
many
times
or
how
is
it
possible
for
us
out
of
the
vast
variety
of
events
in
which
there
is
so
great
a
similarity
which
one
in
particular
to
ascribe
to
its
right
prediction
among
the
numerous
prophecies
furthermore
provided
some
of
the
prophecies
should
point
out
some
particular
events
which
have
since
taken
place
there
might
have
been
previous
grounds
of
probability
that
such
or
such
events
would
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
come
to
pass
for
instance
it
is
no
ways
extraordinary
that
the
prophet
jeremiah
should
be
able
to
predict
that
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
should
take
jerusalem
when
we
consider
the
power
of
the
babylonish
empire
at
that
time
and
the
feebleness
of
the
jews
word
which
came
to
jeremiah
from
the
lord
when
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
and
all
his
army
and
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
of
his
dominion
and
all
the
people
fought
against
jerusalem
and
against
all
the
cities
thereof
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
the
god
of
israel
go
and
speak
unto
zedekiah
king
of
judah
and
tell
him
thus
saith
the
lord
behold
i
will
give
this
city
of
jerusalem
into
the
hand
of
the
king
of
no
politicians
could
at
the
time
of
the
prediction
be
much
at
a
loss
respecting
the
fate
of
jerusalem
nor
would
it
be
at
all
evidential
to
any
candid
and
ingenious
enquirer
that
god
had
any
manner
of
agency
in
fabricating
the
prophecies
though
some
of
them
should
seem
to
decypher
future
events
as
they
might
to
human
appearance
turn
out
right
merely
from
accident
or
contingency
it
is
very
improbable
or
rather
incompatible
with
human
nature
that
the
prophecy
of
micah
will
ever
come
to
pass
who
predicts
that
they
speaking
of
mankind
beat
their
swords
into
and
their
spears
into
nation
shall
not
lift
up
sword
against
nation
neither
shall
they
learn
war
any
some
of
the
prophecies
are
so
apparently
contradictory
that
they
contain
their
own
confutation
as
for
instance
the
prophecy
of
micaiah
contained
in
the
book
of
chronicles
which
probably
is
as
absurd
as
any
thing
that
is
to
be
met
with
in
story
and
when
he
was
come
unto
the
king
the
king
said
unto
him
micaiah
shall
we
go
to
ramoth
gilead
to
battle
or
shall
i
forbear
and
he
said
go
ye
up
and
prosper
and
they
shall
be
delivered
into
your
hand
and
the
king
said
unto
him
how
many
times
shall
i
adjure
thee
that
thou
shalt
tell
me
nothing
but
that
which
is
true
in
the
name
of
the
lord
then
he
said
i
did
see
all
israel
scattered
upon
the
mountains
as
sheep
that
have
no
shepherd
and
the
lord
said
these
have
no
master
let
them
return
therefore
every
man
to
his
house
in
peace
and
the
king
said
unto
jehoshaphat
did
not
i
tell
thee
that
he
would
prophecy
no
good
concerning
me
but
evil
again
he
said
therefore
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
i
saw
the
lord
sitting
upon
his
throne
and
all
the
host
of
heaven
standing
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left
and
the
lord
said
who
shall
entice
ahab
king
of
israel
that
he
may
go
up
and
fall
at
ramoth
gilead
and
one
spake
saying
after
this
manner
and
another
saying
after
that
manner
then
there
came
out
a
spirit
and
stood
before
the
lord
and
said
i
will
entice
him
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
wherewith
and
he
said
i
will
go
forth
and
be
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets
and
the
lord
said
thou
shalt
entice
him
and
thou
shalt
prevail
go
out
and
do
even
so
now
therefore
behold
the
lord
hath
put
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
these
thy
prophets
and
the
lord
hath
spoken
evil
against
thee
it
is
observable
that
the
prophet
at
first
predicted
the
prosperity
of
ahab
saying
go
ye
up
and
prosper
and
they
shall
be
delivered
into
your
hand
but
after
a
little
adjurement
by
the
king
he
alters
his
prediction
and
prophecies
diametrically
the
reverse
what
is
more
certain
than
that
the
event
of
the
expedition
against
ramoth
gilead
must
have
comported
with
the
one
or
the
other
of
his
prophecies
certain
it
was
that
ahab
would
take
it
or
not
take
it
he
must
either
prosper
or
not
prosper
as
there
would
be
no
third
way
or
means
between
these
two
and
it
appears
that
the
prophet
was
determined
to
be
in
the
right
of
it
by
his
prophecy
both
ways
it
further
appears
from
his
prophecy
that
there
was
a
great
consultation
in
heaven
to
entice
ahab
king
of
israel
to
his
destruction
and
that
a
certain
lying
spirit
came
and
stood
before
the
lord
and
proposed
to
him
to
go
out
and
be
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
the
king
prophets
but
what
is
the
most
incredible
is
that
god
should
countenance
it
and
give
him
positive
orders
to
falsify
the
truth
to
the
other
prophets
it
appears
that
micaiah
in
his
first
prophecy
viz
go
up
to
ramoth
gilead
and
prosper
and
they
shall
be
delivered
into
your
hand
acted
in
concert
with
the
lying
spirit
which
stood
before
the
lord
but
afterwards
acted
the
treacherous
part
by
prophecying
the
truth
which
if
we
may
credit
his
account
was
in
direct
opposition
to
the
scheme
of
heaven
secton
ii
the
contentions
which
subsisted
between
the
prophets
respecting
their
veracity
and
their
inconsistencies
with
one
another
and
with
the
nature
of
things
and
their
omission
in
teaching
the
doctrine
of
immortality
precludes
the
divinity
of
their
prophecies
whoever
examines
the
writings
of
the
prophets
will
discover
a
spirit
of
strife
and
contention
among
them
they
would
charge
each
other
with
fallacy
and
deception
disputations
of
this
kind
are
plentifully
interspersed
through
the
writings
of
the
prophets
we
will
transcribe
a
few
of
those
passages
out
of
many
thus
saith
the
lord
to
the
foolish
prophets
that
follow
their
own
spirit
and
have
found
nothing
they
have
seen
vanity
and
lying
divination
saying
the
lord
saith
and
the
lord
hath
not
sent
them
and
they
have
made
others
to
hope
that
they
would
confirm
the
word
and
in
another
place
i
have
not
sent
these
prophets
yet
they
ran
i
have
not
spoken
unto
them
yet
they
prophecy
again
i
have
heard
what
the
prophets
said
that
prophecy
lies
in
my
name
saying
i
have
dreamed
i
have
dreamed
yet
they
are
the
prophets
of
the
deceit
of
their
own
hearts
and
again
yea
they
are
greedy
dogs
which
can
never
have
enough
and
they
are
shepherds
that
can
not
understand
they
all
look
to
their
own
way
every
one
for
his
gain
from
his
quarter
it
being
the
case
that
there
was
such
a
strife
among
the
prophets
to
recommend
themselves
to
the
people
and
every
art
and
dissimulation
having
been
practised
by
them
to
gain
power
and
superiority
all
which
artifice
was
to
be
judged
of
by
the
great
vulgar
or
in
some
instances
by
the
political
views
of
the
jewish
sanhedrim
how
could
those
who
were
cotemporaries
with
the
several
prophets
distinguish
the
premised
true
prophets
from
the
false
much
less
how
can
we
who
live
more
than
seventeen
hundred
years
since
the
last
of
them
be
able
to
distinguish
them
apart
and
yet
without
the
knowledge
of
this
distinction
we
can
not
with
propriety
give
credit
to
any
of
them
even
admitting
there
were
some
true
prophets
among
them
nor
is
it
possible
for
us
to
know
but
that
their
very
institution
was
merely
a
reach
of
policy
of
the
israelitish
and
judaic
governments
the
more
easily
implicitly
and
effectually
to
keep
their
people
in
subordination
by
inculcating
a
belief
that
they
were
ruled
with
special
directions
from
heaven
which
in
fact
originated
from
the
sanhedrim
many
other
nations
have
made
use
of
much
the
same
kind
of
policy
in
the
chapter
of
genesis
we
have
a
history
of
a
very
extraordinary
command
from
god
to
abraham
and
of
a
very
unnatural
attempt
of
his
to
obey
it
and
it
came
to
pass
after
these
things
that
god
did
tempt
abraham
and
he
said
unto
him
abraham
and
he
said
behold
here
i
am
and
he
said
take
now
thy
son
isaac
whom
thou
lovest
and
get
thee
to
the
land
of
moriah
and
offer
him
there
for
a
burnt
offering
upon
one
of
the
mountains
which
i
will
tell
thee
of
and
they
came
to
the
place
which
god
had
told
him
of
and
abraham
built
an
altar
there
and
laid
the
wood
in
order
and
bound
isaac
his
son
and
laid
him
on
the
altar
upon
the
wood
and
abraham
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
took
the
knife
to
slay
his
son
shocking
attempt
murder
is
allowed
by
mankind
in
general
to
be
the
most
capital
crime
that
is
possible
to
be
acted
among
men
it
would
therefore
be
incompatible
with
the
divine
nature
to
have
enjoined
it
by
a
positive
command
to
abraham
to
have
killed
his
son
a
murder
of
all
others
the
most
unnatural
and
cruel
and
attended
with
the
most
aggravating
circumstances
not
merely
from
a
prescribed
breach
of
the
ties
of
parental
affection
but
from
the
consideration
that
the
child
was
to
be
if
we
may
credit
the
command
offered
to
god
as
a
religious
sacrifice
what
could
have
been
a
more
complicated
wickedness
than
the
obedience
of
this
command
would
have
been
and
what
can
be
more
absurd
than
to
suppose
that
it
came
from
god
it
is
argued
in
vindication
of
the
injunction
to
abraham
to
kill
his
son
that
it
was
merely
for
a
trial
of
his
obedience
and
that
god
never
designed
to
have
him
do
it
to
prevent
which
an
angel
from
heaven
called
to
him
and
gave
him
counter
orders
not
to
slay
his
son
but
to
suppose
that
god
needed
such
an
experiment
or
any
other
in
order
to
know
whether
abraham
would
be
obedient
to
his
commands
is
utterly
incompatible
with
his
omniscience
who
without
public
exhibitions
understands
all
things
so
that
had
the
injunction
been
in
itself
fit
and
reasonable
and
also
from
god
the
compliance
or
of
abraham
thereto
could
not
have
communicated
any
new
idea
to
the
divine
mind
every
part
of
the
conduct
of
mankind
is
a
trial
of
their
obedience
and
is
known
to
god
as
well
as
the
particular
conduct
of
abraham
besides
in
the
canonical
writings
we
read
that
can
not
be
tempted
with
evil
neither
tempteth
he
any
how
then
can
it
be
god
did
tempt
abraham
a
sort
of
employment
which
in
scripture
is
commonly
ascribed
to
the
devil
it
is
a
very
common
thing
to
hear
abraham
extolled
for
attempting
to
comply
with
the
supposed
command
of
sacrificing
his
son
but
it
appears
to
me
that
it
had
been
wiser
and
more
becoming
the
character
of
a
virtuous
man
for
abraham
to
have
replied
in
answer
to
the
injunction
as
follows
to
wit
that
it
could
not
possibly
have
come
from
god
who
was
the
fountain
of
goodness
and
perfection
and
unchangeable
in
his
nature
who
had
endowed
him
with
reason
and
understanding
whereby
he
knew
his
duty
to
god
his
son
and
to
himself
better
than
to
kill
his
only
son
and
offer
him
as
a
religious
sacrifice
to
god
for
god
would
never
have
implanted
in
his
mind
such
a
strong
affection
towards
him
nor
such
a
conscious
sense
of
duty
to
provide
for
protect
and
succor
him
in
all
duties
and
to
promote
his
happiness
and
well
being
provided
he
had
designed
that
he
should
have
laid
violent
hands
on
his
life
and
inasmuch
as
the
command
was
in
itself
morally
speaking
unfit
and
altogether
unworthy
of
god
he
presumed
that
it
never
originated
from
him
but
from
some
inhuman
cruel
and
destructive
being
who
delighted
in
wo
and
pungent
grief
for
god
could
not
have
been
the
author
of
so
base
an
injunction
nor
could
he
be
pleased
with
so
inhuman
and
sinful
a
sacrifice
moses
in
his
last
chapter
of
deuteronomy
crowns
his
history
with
the
particular
account
of
his
own
death
and
burial
so
moses
the
servant
of
the
lord
died
there
in
the
land
of
moab
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
and
he
buried
him
in
a
valley
in
the
land
of
moab
over
against
bethpeor
but
no
man
knew
of
his
sepulchre
unto
this
day
and
moses
was
an
hundred
and
twenty
years
old
when
he
died
his
eyes
were
not
dim
nor
his
natural
force
abated
and
the
children
of
israel
wept
for
moses
in
the
plains
of
moab
thirty
days
this
is
the
only
historian
in
the
circle
of
my
reading
who
has
ever
given
the
public
a
particular
account
of
his
own
death
and
how
old
he
was
at
that
decisive
period
where
he
died
who
buried
him
and
where
he
was
buried
and
withal
of
the
number
of
days
his
friends
and
acquaintances
mourned
and
wept
for
him
i
must
confess
i
do
not
expect
to
be
able
to
advise
the
public
of
the
term
of
my
life
nor
the
circumstances
of
my
death
and
burial
nor
of
the
days
of
the
weeping
or
laughing
of
my
survivors
part
of
the
laws
of
moses
were
arbitrary
impositions
upon
the
tribes
of
israel
and
have
no
foundation
in
the
reason
and
fitness
of
things
particularly
that
in
which
he
inculcates
punishing
the
children
for
the
iniquities
of
the
father
visiting
the
iniquities
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
and
upon
the
children
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation
there
is
no
reason
to
be
given
why
the
iniquity
of
the
father
might
not
as
well
have
involved
the
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
generations
and
so
on
to
the
latest
posterity
in
guilt
and
punishment
as
the
first
four
generations
for
if
it
was
possible
that
the
iniquity
of
the
father
could
be
justly
visited
upon
any
of
his
posterity
who
were
not
accomplices
with
him
in
the
iniquity
or
were
not
some
way
or
other
aiding
or
accessary
in
it
then
the
iniquity
might
as
justly
be
visited
upon
any
one
of
the
succeeding
generations
as
upon
another
or
upon
the
generation
of
any
indifferent
person
for
arbitrary
imputations
of
iniquity
are
equally
absurd
in
all
supposable
cases
so
that
if
we
once
admit
the
possibility
of
visiting
iniquity
upon
any
others
than
the
perpetrators
be
they
who
they
will
we
overturn
our
natural
and
scientifical
notions
of
a
personal
retribution
of
justice
among
mankind
it
is
in
plain
english
punishing
the
innocent
for
the
sin
of
the
guilty
but
virtue
or
vice
can
not
be
thus
visited
or
imputed
from
the
fathers
to
the
unoffending
children
or
to
children
children
or
which
is
the
same
thing
from
the
guilty
to
the
innocent
for
moral
good
or
evil
is
mental
and
personal
which
can
not
be
transferred
changed
or
altered
from
one
person
to
another
but
is
inherently
connected
with
its
respective
personal
actors
and
constitutes
a
quality
or
habit
and
is
the
merit
or
demerit
of
the
respective
agents
or
proficients
in
moral
good
or
evil
and
is
by
nature
inalienable
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
shall
be
upon
him
and
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked
shall
be
upon
him
but
as
we
shall
have
occasion
to
argue
this
matter
at
large
in
the
twelfth
chapter
of
this
treatise
where
we
shall
treat
of
the
imputed
sin
of
adam
to
his
posterity
and
of
imputative
righteousness
we
will
discuss
the
subject
of
imputation
no
farther
in
this
place
however
the
unjust
practice
of
punishing
the
children
for
the
iniquity
of
the
father
having
been
an
ordinance
of
moses
was
more
or
less
continued
by
the
israelites
as
in
the
case
of
achan
and
his
children
and
joshua
and
all
israel
with
him
took
achan
the
son
of
zorah
and
the
silver
and
the
garment
and
the
wedge
of
gold
and
his
sons
and
his
daughters
and
his
oxen
and
his
asses
and
his
sheep
and
his
tent
and
all
that
he
had
and
brought
them
to
the
valley
of
achor
and
all
israel
stoned
him
with
stones
and
burned
them
with
fire
after
they
had
stoned
them
with
stones
and
they
raised
over
him
a
great
heap
of
stones
unto
this
day
so
the
lord
turned
from
the
fierceness
of
his
anger
is
incompatible
with
the
divine
perfection
nor
is
the
cruel
extirpation
of
the
innocent
family
and
live
stock
of
achan
to
be
accounted
for
on
principles
of
reason
this
flagrant
injustice
of
punishing
the
children
for
the
iniquity
of
the
father
had
introduced
a
proverb
in
israel
viz
the
fathers
have
eaten
sour
grapes
and
the
children
teeth
are
set
on
edge
but
the
prophet
ezekiel
in
the
chapter
of
his
prophecies
has
confuted
moses
statutes
of
visiting
the
iniquities
of
the
father
upon
the
children
and
repealed
them
with
the
authority
of
thus
saith
the
lord
which
was
the
manner
of
expression
by
which
they
were
promulgated
but
the
prophet
ezekiel
did
not
repeal
those
statutes
of
moses
merely
by
the
authority
of
thus
saith
the
lord
but
over
and
above
gives
the
reason
for
it
otherwise
he
could
not
have
repealed
them
for
moses
enacted
them
as
he
relates
from
as
high
authority
as
ezekiel
could
pretend
to
in
nullifying
them
so
that
had
he
not
produced
reason
and
argument
it
would
have
been
thus
saith
the
lord
against
thus
saith
the
lord
but
ezekiel
reasons
conclusively
viz
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
again
saying
what
meat
ye
that
ye
use
this
proverb
concerning
the
land
of
israel
saying
the
fathers
have
eaten
sour
grapes
and
the
children
teeth
are
set
on
edge
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
ye
shall
not
have
occasion
any
more
to
use
this
proverb
in
israel
behold
all
souls
are
mine
as
the
soul
of
the
father
so
also
the
soul
of
the
son
is
mine
the
soul
that
sinneth
it
shall
die
the
son
shall
not
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
father
neither
shall
the
father
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
son
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
shall
be
upon
him
and
the
wickedness
of
the
wicked
shall
be
upon
him
therefore
i
will
judge
you
o
house
of
israel
every
one
according
to
their
ways
saith
the
lord
god
it
is
observable
that
the
prophet
ingeniously
says
ye
shall
not
have
occasion
any
more
to
use
this
proverb
in
israel
implicitly
acknowledging
that
the
law
of
moses
had
given
occasion
to
that
proverb
nor
was
it
possible
to
remove
that
proverb
or
grievance
to
which
the
israelites
were
liable
on
account
of
visiting
the
iniquities
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
but
by
the
repeal
of
the
statute
of
moses
in
that
case
made
and
provided
which
was
effectually
done
by
ezekiel
in
consequence
whereof
the
administration
of
justice
became
disencumbered
of
the
embarrassments
under
which
it
had
labored
for
many
centuries
thus
it
appears
that
those
laws
denominated
the
laws
of
god
are
not
infallible
but
have
their
exceptions
and
may
be
dispensed
with
under
the
dispensation
of
the
law
a
breach
of
the
sabbath
was
a
capital
offence
and
while
the
children
of
israel
were
in
the
wilderness
they
found
a
man
that
gathered
sticks
on
the
sabbath
day
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
the
man
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
and
all
the
congregation
shall
stone
him
with
stones
without
the
camp
and
all
the
congregation
brought
him
without
the
camp
and
stoned
him
with
stones
and
he
died
as
the
lord
commanded
moses
the
very
institution
of
the
sabbath
was
in
itself
arbitrary
otherwise
it
would
not
have
been
changed
from
the
last
to
the
first
day
of
the
week
for
those
ordinances
which
are
predicated
on
the
reason
and
fitness
of
things
can
never
change
as
that
which
is
once
morally
fit
always
remains
so
and
is
immutable
nor
could
the
same
crime
in
justice
deserve
death
in
moses
time
as
in
the
instance
of
the
israelite
gathering
sticks
and
but
a
pecuniary
fine
in
ours
as
in
the
instance
of
the
breach
of
sabbath
in
these
times
furthermore
the
order
of
nature
respecting
day
and
night
or
the
succession
of
time
is
such
as
renders
it
impossible
that
any
identical
part
of
time
which
constitutes
one
day
can
do
it
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
globe
at
the
same
time
or
in
the
same
period
day
is
perpetually
dawning
and
night
commencing
to
some
or
other
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
terraqueous
ball
without
intermission
at
the
distance
of
fifteen
degrees
of
longitude
to
the
east
of
us
the
day
begins
an
hour
sooner
than
it
does
with
us
here
in
vermont
and
with
us
an
hour
sooner
than
it
does
fifteen
degrees
to
the
westward
and
thus
it
continues
in
succession
round
the
globe
and
night
as
regularly
revolving
after
it
succeeding
each
other
in
their
alternate
rounds
so
that
when
it
is
with
us
it
is
with
our
species
denominated
the
periaeci
who
live
under
the
same
parallel
of
latitude
with
us
but
under
a
directly
opposite
meridian
so
likewise
when
it
is
with
them
it
is
with
us
thus
it
appears
that
the
same
identical
part
of
time
which
composes
our
days
compose
their
nights
and
while
we
are
keeping
sunday
they
are
in
their
midnight
dreams
nor
is
it
possible
in
nature
that
the
same
identical
part
of
time
which
makes
the
first
day
of
the
week
with
us
should
make
the
first
day
of
the
week
with
the
inhabitants
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
globe
the
apostle
james
speaks
candidly
on
this
subject
saying
some
esteem
one
day
above
another
others
esteem
every
day
alike
let
every
one
be
fully
persuaded
in
his
own
mind
and
keep
the
laws
of
the
land
it
was
unfortunate
for
the
israelite
who
was
accused
of
gathering
sticks
on
the
israelitish
sabbath
that
he
was
convicted
of
it
for
though
by
the
law
of
his
people
he
must
have
died
yet
the
act
for
which
he
suffered
was
no
breach
of
the
law
of
nature
supposing
that
very
delinquent
should
come
to
this
world
again
and
gather
sticks
on
saturday
in
this
country
he
might
as
an
hireling
receive
his
wages
for
it
without
being
exposed
to
a
similar
prosecution
of
that
of
moses
and
provided
he
should
gather
sticks
on
our
sunday
his
wages
would
atone
for
his
crime
instead
of
his
life
since
modern
legislators
have
abated
the
rigor
of
the
law
for
which
he
died
the
barbarous
zeal
of
the
prophet
samuel
in
hewing
agag
to
pieces
after
he
was
made
prisoner
by
saul
king
of
israel
could
not
proceed
from
a
good
spirit
nor
would
such
cruelty
be
permitted
towards
a
prisoner
in
any
civilized
nation
at
this
day
and
samuel
hewed
agag
to
pieces
before
the
lord
in
gilgal
the
unmanly
deed
seems
to
be
mentioned
with
a
phiz
of
religion
viz
that
it
was
done
before
the
lord
but
that
can
not
alter
the
nature
of
the
act
itself
for
every
act
of
mankind
whether
good
or
evil
is
done
before
the
lord
as
much
as
hewing
agag
to
pieces
the
orders
which
samuel
gave
unto
saul
as
he
says
by
the
word
of
the
lord
to
cut
off
the
posterity
of
the
amalekites
and
to
destroy
them
utterly
together
with
the
cause
of
god
displeasure
with
them
are
unworthy
of
god
as
may
be
seen
at
large
in
the
chapter
of
the
book
of
samuel
spare
them
not
but
slay
both
man
and
woman
infant
and
suckling
ox
and
sheep
camel
and
ass
the
ostensible
reason
for
all
this
was
because
the
ancestors
of
the
amalekites
as
long
before
the
days
of
samuel
as
when
the
children
of
israel
came
out
of
egypt
which
was
near
five
hundred
years
had
ambushed
and
fought
against
israel
in
their
passage
from
thence
to
the
land
which
they
afterwards
inhabited
although
it
appears
from
the
history
of
moses
and
joshua
that
israel
was
going
to
disposess
them
of
their
country
which
is
thought
to
be
a
sufficient
cause
of
war
in
these
days
it
is
true
they
insinuate
that
the
lord
had
given
the
land
to
the
children
of
israel
yet
it
appears
that
they
had
to
fight
for
it
and
get
it
by
the
hardest
notwithstanding
as
is
the
case
with
nations
in
these
days
and
ever
has
been
since
the
knowledge
of
history
but
be
the
old
quarrel
between
israel
and
amalek
as
it
will
it
can
not
on
any
principle
be
supposed
the
successors
of
those
amalekites
in
the
days
of
samuel
could
be
guilty
of
any
premised
transgressions
of
their
predecessors
the
sanguinary
laws
of
moses
did
not
admit
of
visiting
the
iniquities
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
in
the
line
of
succession
farther
than
to
the
fourth
generation
but
the
amalekites
against
whom
samuel
had
denounced
the
wrath
of
god
by
the
hand
of
saul
were
at
a
much
greater
remove
from
those
their
progenitors
who
were
charged
with
the
crime
for
which
they
were
cut
off
as
a
nation
nor
is
it
compatible
with
reason
to
suppose
that
god
ever
directed
either
moses
or
joshua
to
extirpate
the
canaanitish
nations
and
we
took
all
his
cities
at
that
time
and
utterly
destroyed
the
men
and
the
women
and
the
little
ones
of
every
city
we
left
none
to
remain
there
is
not
more
propriety
in
ascribing
these
cruelties
to
god
than
those
that
were
perpetrated
by
the
spaniards
against
the
mexican
and
peruvian
indians
or
natives
of
america
every
one
who
dares
to
exercise
his
reason
free
from
bias
will
readily
discern
that
the
inhumanities
exercised
towards
the
canaanites
and
amorites
mexicans
and
peruvians
were
detestably
wicked
and
could
not
be
approbated
by
god
or
by
rational
and
good
men
undoubtedly
avarice
and
domination
were
the
causes
of
those
abounding
cruelties
in
which
religion
had
as
little
to
do
as
in
the
crusades
of
the
holy
land
so
called
the
writings
of
the
prophets
abound
with
prodigies
strange
and
unnatural
events
the
walls
of
jericho
are
represented
to
have
fallen
to
the
ground
in
consequence
of
a
blast
of
ram
horns
balaam
ass
to
speak
to
his
master
and
the
prophet
elijah
is
said
to
have
been
carried
off
bodily
into
heaven
by
a
chariot
in
a
whirlwind
strange
stories
but
other
scriptures
tell
us
flesh
and
blood
can
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
the
history
of
the
affront
which
the
little
children
of
bethel
gave
the
prophet
elisha
his
cursing
them
and
their
destruction
by
the
bears
has
the
appearance
of
a
fable
that
elisha
should
be
so
exasperated
at
the
children
for
calling
him
and
telling
him
to
was
rather
a
sample
of
ill
breeding
most
gentlemen
would
have
laughed
at
the
joke
instead
of
cursing
them
or
being
instrumental
in
their
destruction
by
merciless
wild
and
voracious
beasts
though
the
children
were
saucy
yet
a
man
of
any
considerable
candor
would
have
made
allowance
for
their
for
childhood
and
youth
are
vanity
and
he
went
up
from
thence
unto
bethel
and
as
he
was
going
up
by
the
way
there
came
forth
little
children
out
of
the
city
and
mocked
him
and
said
unto
him
go
up
thou
go
up
thou
and
he
turned
back
and
looked
on
them
and
he
cursed
them
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
there
came
forth
two
she
bears
out
of
the
wood
and
tare
forty
and
two
children
of
them
it
seems
by
the
children
address
to
elisha
that
he
was
an
old
man
and
that
they
had
heard
that
his
mate
elijah
had
gone
up
a
little
before
and
as
it
was
an
uncommon
thing
for
men
to
kite
away
into
the
air
and
leave
the
world
after
that
sort
it
is
likely
that
it
excited
a
curiosity
in
the
children
to
see
elisha
go
off
with
himself
in
the
same
manner
which
occasioned
their
particular
mode
of
speech
to
him
saying
go
up
bald
head
the
writings
of
solomon
song
of
israel
must
needs
have
been
foisted
into
the
canonical
volume
by
some
means
or
other
for
no
one
passage
therein
gives
the
least
intimation
of
inspiration
or
that
he
had
any
immediate
dictation
from
god
in
his
compositions
but
oh
the
contrary
he
informs
us
that
he
acquired
his
knowledge
by
applying
himself
to
wisdom
to
seek
and
to
search
out
concerning
all
things
that
are
done
under
the
sun
this
sore
travail
says
he
has
god
given
to
the
sons
of
men
to
be
exercised
therewith
and
since
solomon
never
pretended
to
inspiration
others
can
not
justly
claim
his
writings
to
have
been
anything
more
than
natural
reasonings
for
who
can
with
propriety
stamp
his
writings
with
divine
authority
when
he
pretended
no
such
thing
but
the
contrary
his
song
of
songs
appears
to
be
rather
of
the
amorous
kind
and
is
supposed
to
have
been
written
at
the
time
he
was
making
love
to
the
daughter
of
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
who
is
said
to
have
been
a
princess
of
exquisite
beauty
and
exceeding
coy
and
so
captivated
his
affections
that
it
made
him
light
headed
and
sing
about
the
of
her
and
her
the
divine
legation
of
moses
and
the
prophets
is
rendered
questionable
from
the
consideration
that
they
never
taught
the
doctrine
of
immortality
their
rewards
and
punishments
are
altogether
temporary
terminating
at
death
they
have
not
so
much
as
exhibited
any
speculation
of
surviving
the
grave
to
this
is
ascribed
the
unbelief
of
the
sadducees
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
or
of
an
angel
or
spirit
as
they
strenuously
adhered
to
the
law
of
moses
for
they
could
not
imagine
but
that
their
great
prophet
and
law
giver
would
have
apprised
them
of
a
state
of
immortality
had
it
been
true
and
in
this
the
sadducees
seem
to
argue
with
force
on
their
position
of
the
divine
legation
of
moses
for
admitting
the
reality
of
man
immortality
it
appears
incredible
to
suppose
that
god
should
have
specially
commissioned
moses
as
his
prophet
and
instructor
to
the
tribes
of
israel
and
not
withal
to
have
instructed
them
in
the

from

that
part
of

were
communicated
to
them
by
dreams

in

be

a

our

agrees
with

and

that
there
is
no

to

in

they
are
fictitious

therefore
not

by

credulous

who
still
retain
a
veneration

that
a

from
god
to
man
to
be
continued
to
the
latest
posterity
as
a
divine
and
perfect
rule
of
duty

should
be
communicated
through
such
a
fictitious

channel
carries
with
it
the
evident
marks
of
deception
itself
or
of
unintelligibleness
as
appears
from
the
vision
of
paul
it
is
not
expedient
for
me
doubtless
to
glory
i
will
come
to
visions
and
revelations
of
the
lord
i
knew
a
man
in
christ
above
fourteen
years
ago
whether
in
the
body
i
can
not
tell
or
whether
out
of
the
body
i
can
not
tell
god
knoweth
such
an
one
caught
up
to
the
third
heavens
and
i
knew
such
a
man
whether
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
i
can
not
tell
god
knoweth
how
that
he
was
caught
up
into
paradise
and
heard
unspeakable
words
which
it
is
not
lawful
for
a
man
to
utter
that
god
knoweth
the
whole
affair
will
not
be
disputed
but
that
we
should
understand
it
is
impossible
for
the
apostle
account
of
his
vision
is
unintelligible
it
appears
that
he
was
rather
in
a
delirium
or
a
stupor
so
that
he
knew
not
that
whether
he
was
in
or
out
of
the
body
he
says
he
heard
words
but
this
communicates
no
intelligence
of
the
of
them
to
us
and
that
they
not
lawful
for
a
man
to
but
what
they
were
or
wherein
their
unlawfulness
to
be
uttered
by
man
consisted
he
does
not
inform
us
his
revelation
from
his
own
story
was
unspeakable
and
unlawful
and
so
he
told
us
nothing
what
it
was
nor
does
it
compose
any
part
of
revelation
which
is
to
make
known
he
is
explicit
as
to
his
being
caught
up
to
the
third
heaven
but
how
he
could
understand
that
is
incredible
when
at
the
same
time
he
knew
not
whether
he
was
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
and
if
he
was
in
such
a
delirium
that
he
did
not
know
so
domestic
a
matter
as
that
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
could
be
a
competent
judge
whether
he
was
at
the
first
second
third
or
fourth
heaven
or
whether
he
was
advanced
above
the
surface
of
the
earth
or
not
that
the
apostles
in
their
ministry
were
dictated
by
the
holy
ghost
in
the
settlement
of
disputable
doctrines
is
highly
questionable
forasmuch
as
we
have
heard
that
certain
which
went
out
from
us
have
troubled
you
with
words
subverting
your
souls
saying
ye
must
be
circumcised
and
keep
the
law
to
whom
we
gave
no
such
commandment
for
it
seemed
good
to
the
holy
ghost
and
to
us
to
lay
upon
you
no
other
burden
than
these
necessary
things
acts
and
after
having
given
a
history
of
the
disputations
concerning
circumcision
and
of
keeping
the
law
of
moses
and
of
the
result
of
the
council
the
same
chapter
informs
us
that
a
contention
happened
so
sharp
between
paul
and
barnabas
that
they
parted
asunder
the
one
from
the
other
had
the
holy
ghost
been
the
dictator
of
the
first
teachers
of
christianity
as
individuals
there
could
have
been
no
disputable
doctrines
or
controversies
respecting
the
religion
which
they
were
promulgating
in
the
world
or
in
the
manner
of
doing
it
to
be
referred
to
a
general
council
of
the
apostles
and
elders
held
at
jerusalem
for
had
they
been
directed
by
the
holy
ghost
there
could
have
been
no
controversies
among
them
to
have
referred
to
the
council
and
inasmuch
as
the
holy
ghost
neglected
them
as
individuals
why
is
it
not
as
likely
that
it
neglected
to
dictate
the
council
held
at
jerusalem
or
elsewhere
it
seems
that
the
holy
ghost
no
otherwise
directed
them
in
their
plan
of
religion
than
by
the
general
council
of
the
apostles
and
elders
the
same
as
all
other
communities
are
governed
paul
having
passed
through
the
upper
coasts
came
to
ephesus
and
finding
certain
disciples
he
said
unto
them
have
ye
received
the
holy
ghost
since
ye
believed
and
they
said
unto
him
we
have
not
so
much
as
heard
whether
there
be
any
holy
ghost
and
when
paul
had
laid
his
hands
upon
them
the
holy
ghost
came
on
them
and
they
spoke
with
tongues
and
prophesied
the
spirit
of
god
is
that
which
constitutes
the
divine
essence
and
makes
him
to
be
what
he
is
but
that
he
should
be
dictated
or
his
spirit
be
communicated
by
any
acts
or
ceremonies
of
the
apostles
is
by
no
means
admissible
for
such
exertions
of
the
apostles
so
far
as
they
may
be
supposed
to
communicate
the
holy
spirit
to
their
disciples
would
have
made
god
passive
in
the
premised
act
of
the
gift
of
the
spirit
for
it
must
have
been
either
the
immediate
act
of
god
or
of
the
apostles
and
if
it
was
the
immediate
act
of
the
one
it
could
not
have
been
the
immediate
act
of
the
other
to
suppose
that
the
act
of
the
gift
of
the
spirit
was
the
mere
act
of
god
and
at
the
same
time
the
mere
act
of
the
apostles
are
propositions
diametrically
opposed
to
each
other
and
can
not
both
be
true
but
it
may
be
supposed
that
the
gift
of
the
spirit
was
partly
the
act
of
god
and
partly
the
act
of
the
apostles
admitting
this
to
have
been
the
case
the
consequences
would
follow
that
the
act
of
the
gift
of
the
spirit
was
partly
divine
and
partly
human
and
therefore
the
beneficence
and
glory
of
the
grant
of
the
gift
of
the
spirit
unto
the
disciples
would
belong
partly
to
god
and
partly
to
the
apostles
and
in
an
exact
proportion
to
that
which
god
and
they
may
be
supposed
to
have
respectively
contributed
towards
the
marvellous
act
of
the
gift
of
the
spirit
but
that
god
should
act
in
partnership
with
man
or
share
his
providence
and
glory
with
him
is
too
absurd
to
demand
argumentative
confutation
especially
in
an
act
which
immediately
respects
the
display
or
exertion
of
the
divine
spirit
on
the
spirits
of
men
such
delusions
have
taken
place
in
every
age
of
the
world
since
history
has
attained
to
any
considerable
degree
of
intelligence
nor
is
there
at
present
a
nation
on
earth
but
what
is
more
or
less
infatuated
with
delusory
notions
of
the
immediate
influence
of
good
or
evil
spirits
on
their
minds
a
recent
instance
of
it
appears
in
the
elect
lady
as
she
has
seen
fit
to
style
herself
and
her
followers
called
shakers
this
pretended
holy
woman
began
her
religious
scheme
at
connestaguna
in
the
northwestardly
part
of
the
state
of
new
york
about
the
year
and
has
added
a
new
sectary
to
the
religious
catalogue
after
having
instilled
her
tenets
among
the
connestagunites
and
the
adjacent
inhabitants
she
rambled
into
several
parts
of
the
country
promulgating
her
religion
and
has
gained
a
considerable
number
of
scattering
proselytes
not
only
in
the
state
of
new
york
but
some
in
the
new
england
states
she
has
so
wrought
on
the
minds
of
her
female
devotees
respecting
the
fading
nature
vanity
and
tempting
allurements
of
their
ornaments
which
by
the
by
are
not
plenty
among
her
followers
and
the
deceitfulness
of
riches
that
she
has
procured
from
them
a
considerable
number
of
strings
of
gold
beads
and
jewels
and
amassed
a
small
treasure
and
like
most
sectaries
engrosses
the
kingdom
of
heaven
to
herself
and
her
followers
to
the
seclusion
of
all
others
she
gives
out
that
her
mission
is
immediately
from
heaven
that
she
travails
in
pain
for
her
elect
and
pretends
to
talk
in
unknown
languages
in
which
she
converses
with
those
who
have
departed
this
life
and
says
that
there
has
not
been
a
true
church
on
earth
since
the
apostles
days
until
she
had
erected
hers
that
both
the
living
and
the
dead
must
be
saved
in
by
and
through
her
and
that
they
must
confess
their
sins
unto
her
and
procure
her
pardon
or
can
not
be
saved
that
every
of
the
human
race
who
have
died
since
the
apostle
time
until
her
church
was
set
up
has
been
damned
and
that
they
are
continually
making
intercession
to
her
for
salvation
which
is
the
occasion
of
her
talking
to
them
in
those
unknown
tongues
and
that
she
gathers
her
elect
from
earth
and
hell
she
wholly
refuses
to
give
a
reason
for
what
she
does
or
says
but
says
that
it
is
the
duty
of
mankind
to
believe
in
her
and
receive
her
instructions
for
they
are
infallible
for
a
time
she
prohibited
her
disciples
from
propagating
their
species
but
soon
after
gave
them
ample
license
restricting
them
indiscriminately
to
the
pale
of
her
sanctified
church
for
that
she
needed
more
souls
to
complete
the
number
of
her
elect
among
other
things
she
instructs
those
who
are
young
and
sprightly
among
her
pupils
to
practise
the
most
wild
freakish
wanton
and
romantic
gestures
as
to
that
of
indecently
stripping
themselves
twirling
round
extorting
their
features
shaking
and
twitching
their
bodies
and
limbs
into
a
variety
of
odd
and
unusual
ways
and
many
other
extravagancies
of
external
behavior
in
the
practice
of
which
they
are
said
to
be
very
alert
even
to
the
astonishment
of
spectators
having
by
use
acquired
an
uncommon
agility
in
such
twirling
freakish
and
romantic
practices
the
old
lady
having
such
an
ascendancy
over
them
as
to
make
them
believe
that
those
extravagant
actions
were
occasioned
by
the
immediate
power
of
god
it
serves
among
them
as
a
proof
of
the
divinity
of
her
doctrines
a
more
particular
account
of
this
new
sectary
has
been
lately
published
in
a
pamphlet
by
a
rathburn
who
as
he
relates
was
for
a
time
one
of
her
deluded
disciples
but
after
a
while
apostatised
from
the
faith
and
has
since
announced
to
the
world
the
particulars
of
their
doctrine
and
conduct
probably
there
never
was
any
people
or
country
since
the
era
of
historical
knowledge
who
were
more
confident
than
they
that
they
are
acted
upon
by
the
immediate
agency
of
the
divine
spirit
and
as
there
are
facts
now
existing
in
a
considerable
tract
of
country
and
are
notoriously
known
in
this
part
of
america
i
take
the
liberty
to
mention
them
as
a
knowledge
of
these
facts
together
with
the
concurrent
testimony
of
the
history
of
such
deceptions
in
all
ages
and
nations
might
induce
my
countrymen
to
examine
strictly
into
the
claim
and
reality
of
ghostly
intelligence
in

chapter
viii
secton
i
of
the
nature
of
faith
and
wherein
it
consists
faith
in
jesus
christ
and
in
his
gospel
throughout
the
new
testament
is
represented
to
be
an
essential
condition
of
the
eternal
salvation
of
mankind
knowing
that
a
man
is
not
justified
by
the
works
of
the
law
but
by
the
faith
of
jesus
christ
even
we
have
believed
in
jesus
christ
that
we
might
be
justified
by
the
faith
of
christ
and
not
by
the
works
of
the
law
for
by
the
works
of
the
law
shall
no
flesh
be
justified
again
if
thou
shalt
confess
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
believe
in
thine
heart
that
god
hath
raised
him
from
the
dead
thou
mayst
be
saved
and
again
he
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be
saved
but
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
faith
is
the
last
result
of
the
understanding
or
the
same
which
we
call
the
conclusion
it
is
the
consequence
of
a
greater
or
less
deduction
of
reasoning
from
certain
premises
previously
laid
down
it
is
the
same
as
believing
or
judging
of
any
matter
of
fact
or
assenting
to
or
dissenting
from
the
truth
of
any
doctrine
system
or
position
so
that
to
form
a
judgment
or
to
come
to
a
determination
in
one
own
mind
or
to
believe
or
to
have
faith
is
in
reality
the
same
thing
and
is
synonymously
applied
both
in
writing
and
speaking
for
example
abraham
believed
in
god
again
for
he
speaking
of
abraham
judged
him
faithful
who
had
promised
and
again
his
faith
was
counted
unto
him
for
righteousness
it
is
not
only
in
scripture
that
we
meet
with
examples
of
the
three
words
to
wit
belief
judgment
and
faith
to
stand
for
the
marks
of
our
ideas
for
the
same
thing
but
also
all
intelligible
writers
and
speakers
apply
these
phrases
synonymously
and
it
would
be
good
grammar
and
sense
for
us
to
say
that
we
have
faith
in
a
universal
providence
or
that
we
judge
that
there
is
a
universal
providence
these
three
different
phrases
in
communicating
our
ideas
of
providence
do
every
one
of
them
exhibit
the
same
idea
to
all
persons
of
common
understanding
who
are
acquainted
with
the
english
language
in
fine
every
one
experience
may
convince
them
that
they
can
not
assent
to
or
dissent
from
the
truth
of

from

it

that

as
appears
to
be
credibly

can
no
more
partake
of
the
nature
of
goodness
or
morality
than
our
natural
eyes
may
be
supposed
to
partake
of
it
in
their
perception
of
colors
for
the
faith
of
the
mind
and
the
sight
of
the
eye
are
both
of
them
necessary
consequences
the
one
results
from
the
reasonings
of
the
mind
and
the
other
from
the
perception
of
the
eye
to
suppose
a
rational
mind
without
the
exercise
of
faith
would
be
as
absurd
as
to
suppose
a
proper
and
complete
eye
without
sight
or
the
perception
of
the
common
objects
of
that
sense
the
short
of
the
matter
is
this
that
without
reason
we
could
not
have
faith
and
without
the
eye
or
eyes
we
could
not
see
but
once
admitting
that
we
are
rational
faith
follows
of
course
naturally
resulting
from
the
dictates
of
reason
secton
ii
of
the
traditions
of
our
forefathers
it
may
be
objected
that
the
far
greater
part
of
mankind
believe
according
to
the
tradition
of
their
forefathers
without
examining
into
the
grounds
of
it
and
that
argumentative
deductions
from
the
reason
and
nature
of
things
have
with
the
bulk
of
them
but
little
or
no
influence
on
their
faith
admitting
this
to
have
been
too
much
the
case
and
that
many
of
them
have
been
blameable
for
the
omission
of
cultivating
or
improving
their
reason
and
for
not
forming
a
better
judgment
concerning
their
respective
traditions
or
a
juster
and
more
exalted
faith
yet
this
does
not
at
all
invalidate
the
foregoing
arguments
respecting
the
nature
of
faith
for
though
it
be
admitted
that
most
of
the
human
race
do
not
or
will
not
reason
with
any
considerable
degree
of
propriety
on
the
traditions
of
their
forefathers
but
receive
them
implicitly
they
nevertheless
establish
this
one
proposition
in
their
minds
right
or
wrong
that
their
respective
traditions
are
right
for
none
could
believe
in
them
were
they
possessed
of
the
knowledge
that
they
were
wrong
and
as
we
have
a
natural
bias
in
favor
of
our
progenitors
to
whose
memory
a
tribute
of
regard
is
justly
due
and
whose
care
in
handing
down
from
father
to
son
such
notions
of
religion
and
manners
as
they
supposed
would
be
for
the
well
being
and
happiness
of
their
posterity
in
this
and
the
coming
world
naturally
endears
tradition
to
us
and
prompts
us
to
receive
and
venerate
it
add
to
this
that
the
priests
of
every
denomination
are
in
season
and
out
of
season
in
inculcating
and
instilling
the
same
tenets
which
with
the
foregoing
considerations
induces
mankind
in
general
to
give
at
least
a
tacit
consent
to
their
respective
traditions
and
without
a
thorough
investigation
thereof
believe
them
to
be
right
and
very
commonly
infallible
although
their
examinations
are
not
attended
with
argumentative
reasonings
from
the
nature
of
things
and
in
the
same
proportion
as
they
may
be
supposed
to
fall
short
of
conclusive
arguing
on
their
respective
traditions
they
can
not
fail
to
be
deceived
in
the
rationality
of
their
faith
but
after
all
it
may
be
that
some
of
the
human
race
may
have
been
traditionally
or
accidentally
right
in
many
or
most
respects
admitting
it
to
be
so
yet
they
can
not
have
any
rational
enjoyment
of
it
or
understand
wherein
the
truth
of
the
premised
right
tradition
consists
or
deduce
any
more
satisfaction
from
it
than
others
whose
traditions
may
be
supposed
to
be
wrong
for
it
is
the
knowledge
of
the
discovery
of
truth
alone
which
is
gratifying
to
that
mind
who
contemplates
its
superlative
beauty
that
tradition
has
had
a
powerful
influence
on
the
human
mind
is
universally
admitted
even
by
those
who
are
governed
by
it
in
the
articles
or
discipline
of
their
faith
for
though
they
are
blind
with
respect
to
their
own
superstition
yet
they
can
perceive
and
despise
it

others

very
readily
discern
and
expose
the
weak
side
of
popery
and
papists
are
as
ready
and
acute
in
discovering
the
errors
of
heretics
with
equal
facility
do
christians
and
mahometans
spy
out
each
others
inconsistencies
and
both
have
an
admirable
sagacity
to
descry
the
superstition
of
the
heathen
nations
nor
are
the
jews
wholly
silent
in
this
matter

they
defiled

abomination
must
this
have
been
in
the
opinion
of
a
nation
who
had
monopolized
all
religion
to
themselves
monstrous
vile
heathen
that
they
should
presume
to
approach
the
sanctum

the
christians
call
the
mahometans
by
the
odious
name

the
musslemen
in
their
opinion
can
not
call
the
christians
by
a
worse
name
than
that
which
they
have
given
themselves
they
therefore
call
them
christians
what
has
been
already
observed
upon
tradition
is
sufficient
to
admonish
us
of
its
errors
and
superstitions
and
the
prejudices
to
which
a
bigoted
attachment
thereto
exposes
us
which
is
abundantly
sufficient
to
excite
us
to
a
careful
examination
of
our
respective
traditions

not
to

our

is
governed
by
our
reasonings
whether
they
are
supposed
to
be

or
inconclusive
and
not
merely
by
our
own
choice
it
is
written
that
faith
is
the
gift

god
be
it
so
but
is
faith
any
more
the
gift
of
god

reflection

we

we
have
passed
upon
things
and
was
it
not
for
reasoning
in
either
a
regular
or
irregular
manner
or
partly
both
there
could
be
no
such
thing
as
judging
or
believing
so
that
god
could
not
bestow
the
gift
of
faith
separate
from
the
gift
of

faith
being
the
mere
consequence
of
reasoning
either
right

in
a
greater

degree
as
has
been
previously
argued
still
there
is
a
knotty
text
of
scripture
to
surmount
viz
he
that
believeth
shall
be
saved
but
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
this
text
is
considered
as
crowding
hard
upon
unbelievers
in
christianity
but
when
it
is
critically
examined
it
will
be
found
not
to
militate
at
all
against
them
but
is
merely
a
jesuitical
fetch
to
overawe
some
and
make
others
wonder
we
will
premise
that
an
unbeliever
is
destitute
of
faith
which
is
the
cause
of
his
being
thus
denominated
the
christian
believes
the
gospel
to
be
true
and
of
divine
authority
the
deist
believes
that
it
is
not
true
and
not
of
divine
authority
so
that
the
christian
and
deist
are
both
of
them
believers
and
according
to
the
express
words
of
the
text
shall
be
saved
and
a
deist
may
as
well
retort
upon
a
christian
and
call
him
an
infidel
because
he
differs
in
faith
from
him
as
a
christian
may
upon
the
deist
for
there
is
the
same
impropriety
in
applying
the
cant
of
infidelity
to
either
as
both
are
believers
and
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
believe
contrary
to
our
judgments
or
the
dictates
of
understanding
whether
it
be
rightly
informed
or
not
why
then
may
there
not
in
both
denominations
be
honest
men
who
are
seeking
after
the
truth
and
who
may
have
an
equal
right
to
expect

chapter

i
a
trinity
of
persons
can
not
exist
in
the
divine

whether
the
persons
be
supposed
to
be

infinite
with
remarks
on

errors
which
have
taken
place
in
religion
none
have
been
so
fatal
to
it
as
those

respect
the

nature
wrong
notions
of
a
god
or
of
his
providence
sap
its
very
foundation
in
theory
and
practice
as
is
evident
from
the
superstition
discoverable
among
the
major
part
of
mankind
who
instead
of
worshipping
the
true
god
have
been
by
some
means
or
other
infatuated
to
pay
divine
homage
to
mere
creatures
or
to
idols
made
with
hands
or
to
such
as
have
no
existence
but
in
their
own
fertile
imaginations
god
being
incomprehensible
to
us
we
can
not
understand
all
that
perfection
in
which
the
divine
essence
consists
we
can
nevertheless
negatively
comprehend
many
things
in
which
positively
the
divine
essence
does
not
and
can
not
consist
that
it
does
not
consist
of
three
persons
or
of
any
other
number
of
persons
is
as
easily
demonstrated
as
that
the
whole
is
bigger
than
a
part
or
any
other
proposition
in
mathematics
we
will
premise
that
the
three
persons
in
the
supposed
trinity
are
either
finite
or
infinite
for
there
can
not
in
the
scale
of
being
be
a
third
sort
of
beings
between
these
two
for
ever
so
many
and
exalted
degrees
in
finiteness
is
still
finite
and
that
being
who
is
infinite
admits
of
no
degrees
of
enlargement
and
as
all
beings
whatever
must
be
limited
or
unlimited
perfect
or
imperfect
they
must
therefore
be
denominated
to
be
finite
or
infinite
we
will
therefore
premise
the
three
persons
in
the
trinity
to
be
merely
finite
considered
personally
and
individually
from
each
other
and
the
question
would
arise
whether
the
supposed
trinity
of
finites
though
united
in
one
essence
could
be
more
than
finite
still
inasmuch
as
three
imperfect
and
circumscribed
beings
united
together
could
not
constitute
a
being
perfect
or
infinite
any
more
than
absolute
perfection
could
consist
of
three
imperfections
which
would
be
the
same
as
to
suppose
that
infinity
could
be
made
up
or
compounded
of
finiteness
or
that
absolute
uncreated
and
infinite
perfection
could
consist
of
three
personal
and
imperfect
natures
but
on
the
other
hand
to
consider
every
of
the
three
persons
in
the
supposed
trinity
as
being
absolutely
infinite
it
would
be
a
downright
contradiction
to
one
infinite
and
all
comprehending
essence
admitting
that
god
the
father
is
infinite
it
would
necessarily
preclude
the
supposed
god
the
son
and
god
the
holy
ghost
from
the
or
essence
of
god
one
infinite
essence
comprehending
every
power
excellency
and
perfection
which
can
possibly
exist
in
the
divine
nature
was
it
possible
that
three
absolute
infinites
which
is
the
same
as
three
gods
could
be
contained
in
one
and
the
essence
why
not
as
well
any
other
number
of
infinites
but
as
certain
as
infinity
can
not
admit
of
addition
so
certain
a
plurality
of
infinites
can
not
exist
in
the
same
essence
for
real
infinity
is
strict
and
absolute
infinity
and
only
that
and
can
not
be
compounded
of
infinities
or
of
parts
but
forecloses
all
addition
a
personal
or
circumscribed
god
implies
as
great
and
manifest
a
contradiction
as
the
mind
of
man
can
conceive
of
it
is
the
same
as
a
limited
omnipresence
a
weak
almighty
or
a
finite
god
from
the
foregoing
arguments
on
the
trinity
we
infer
that
the
divine
essence
can
not
consist
of
a
trinity
of
persons
whether
they
are
supposed
to
be
either
finite
or
infinite
the
have
exhibited
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
in
an
alarming
point
of
light
viz
whoever
would
be
saved
before
all
things
it
is
necessary
that
he
hold
the
catholic
faith
which
faith
except
every
one
doth
keep
whole
and
undefiled
without
doubt
he
shall
perish
everlastingly
we
next
proceed
to
the
doctrine
the
father
is
eternal
the
son
is
eternal
and
the
holy
ghost
is
eternal
and
yet
there
are
not
three
eternals
but
one
eternal
the
plain
english
is
that
the
three
persons
in
the
trinity
are
three
eternals
individually
considered
and
yet
they
are
not
three
eternals
but
one
eternal
to
say
that
there
are
three
eternals
in
the
trinity
and
yet
that
there
are
not
three
eternals
therein
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
as
much
as
to
say
that
there
are
three
persons
in
the
trinity
and
yet
there
are
not
three
persons
in
the
trinity
the
first
proposition
in
the
creed
affirms
that
the
father
is
eternal
the
second
affirms
that
the
son
is
eternal
the
third
affirms
that
the
holy
ghost
is
eternal
the
fourth
affirms
that
there
are
not
three
eternals
and
the
fifth
that
there
is
but
one
eternal
the
reader
will
observe
that
the
three
first
propositions
are
denied
by
the
fourth
which
denies
that
there
are
three
eternals
though
the
three
first
propositions
affirmed
that
there
were
three
eternals
by
name
viz
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
the
fifth
proposition
is
unconnected
with
either
of
the
former
and
is
undoubtedly
true
viz
but
there
is
one
eternal
the
father
is
god
the
son
is
god
and
the
holy
ghost
is
god
and
yet
there
are
not
three
gods
but
one
god
here
again
we
have
three
gods
by
name
affirmed
to
have
an
existence
by
the
three
first
propositions
by
the
fourth
they
are
negatived
and
the
fifth
affirms
the
truth
again
viz
that
there
is
but
one
god
admitting
the
three
first
propositions
to
be
true
to
wit
that
there
are
three
gods
the
three
could
not
be
one
and
the
same
god
any
more
than
diana
dagan
and
moloch
may
be
supposed
to
be
the
same
and
if
three
gods
their
essences
and
providences
would
interfere
and
make
universal
confusion
and
disorder
the
father
is
almighty
the
son
is
almighty
and
the
holy
ghost
is
almighty
and
yet
there
are
not
three
almighties
but
one
almighty
here
we
have
three
almighties
and
at
the
same
time
but
one
almighty
so
that
the
point
at
issue
is
brought
to
this
simple
question
viz
whether
three
units
can
be
one
or
one
unit
three
or
not
which
is
submitted
to
the
curious
to
determine
our
creed
further
informs
us
that
the
three
persons
in
the
trinity
are
together
and
but
in
its
sequel
we
are
told
that
one
was
begotten
of
the
other
and
when
we
advert
to
the
history
of
that
transaction
we
find
it
to
be
not
quite
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
and
took
place
in
the
reign
of
herod
the
king
of
judea
which
faith
except
we
keep
whole
and
undefined
we
have
a
threat
that
without
doubt
we
shall
perish
everlastingly
secton

for
that
they
partake
of
one
common
sort
of
nature
and
likeness
yet
the
respective
individuals
are
not
one
and
the
same
the
person
of
a
is
not
the
person
of
b
nor
are
they
conscious
of
each
other
consciousness
and
therefore
the
joy
or
grief
of
a
is
not
and
can
not
be
the
joy
or
grief
of
b
this
is
what
we
know
to
be
a
fact
from
our
own
experience
the
reason
of
this
personal
distinction
is
founded
in
nature
for
though
we
partake
of
one
common
nature
and
likeness
yet
we
do
not
partake
of
one
and
the
same
essence
essence
is
therefore
in
the
order
of
nature
the
primary
cause
of
identity
or
sameness
and
can
not
be
divided
from
hence
we
infer
that
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
is
destitute
of
foundation
and
tends
manifestly
to
superstition
and
idolatry

iii
the
imperfection
of
knowledge
in
the
person
of
jesus
christ
incompatible
with
his
divinity
that
jesus
christ
was
not
god
is
evident
from
his
own
words
where
speaking
of
the
day
of
judgment
he
says
of
that
day
and
hour
knoweth
no
man
no
not
the
angels
which
are
in
heaven
neither
the
son
but
the
father
this
is
giving
up
all
pretention
to
divinity
acknowledging
in
the
most
explicit
manner
that
he
did
not
know
all
things
but
compares
his
understanding
to
that
of
man
and
angels
of
that
day
and
hour
knoweth
no
man
no
not
the
angels
which
are
in
heaven
neither
the
son
thus
he
ranks
himself
with
finite
beings
and
with
them
acknowledges
that
he
did
not
know
the
day
and
hour
of
judgment
and
at
the
same
time
ascribes
a
superiority
of
knowledge
to
the
lather
for
that
he
knew
the
day
and
hour
of
judgment
that
he
was
a
mere
creature
is
further
evident
from
his
prayer
to
the
father
saying
father
if
it
be
possible
let
this
cup
pass
from
me
nevertheless
not
my
will
but
thine
be
done
these
expressions
speak
forth
the
most
humble
submission
to
his
father
will
authority
and
government
and
however
becoming
so
submissive
a
disposition
to
the
divine
government
would
be
in
a
creature
it
is
utterly
inconsistent
and
unworthy
of
a
god
or
of
the
person
of
jesus
christ
admitting
him
to
have
been
a
divine
person
or
of
the
essence
of
god
chapter
secton
observations
on
the
state
of
man
in
moses
paradise
on
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
and
on
the
tree
of
life
with
speculations
on
the
divine
prohibition
to
man
not
to
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
former
of
those
trees
interspersed
with
remarks
on
the
mortality
of
innocent
man
the
mortality
of
animal
life
and
the
dissolution
of
that
of
the
vegetable
has
been
particularly
considered
in
chapter
three
section
four
treating
on
physical
evils
we
now
proceed
to
make
an
application
of
those
arguments
in
the
case
of
our
reputed
first
parents
whose
mortality
is
represented
by
moses
to
have
taken
place
in
consequence
of
their
eating
of
the
forbidden
fruit
moses
in
his
description
of
the
garden
of
eden
acquaints
us
with
two
chimerical
kinds
of
fruit
trees
which
among
others
he
tells
us
were
planted
by
god
in
the
place
appointed
for
the
residence
of
the
new
made
couple
the
one
he
calls
by
the
name
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
and
the
other
by
the
name
of
the
tree
of
life
and
previous
to
his
account
of
the
apostacy
he
informs
us
that
god
expressly
commanded
the
man
and
woman
saying
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
it
and
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth
and
god
said
behold
i
have
given
you
every
herb
bearing
seed
which
is
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
and
every
tree
in
which
is
the
fruit
of
a
tree
yielding
seed
to
you
it
shall
be
for
meat
again
and
the
lord
commanded
the
man
saying
of
every
tree
of
the
garden
thou
mayest
freely
eat
but
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
thou
shalt
not
eat
of
it
for
in
the
day
that
thou
eatest
thereof
thou
shalt
surely
die
and
the
lord
said
it
is
not
good
for
man
to
be
alone
i
will
make
him
an
help
meet
for
him
and
the
lord
god
caused
a
deep
sleep
to
fall
upon
adam
and
he
slept
and
he
took
out
one
of
his
ribs
and
closed
up
the
flesh
instead
thereof
and
the
rib
which
the
lord
god
had
taken
from
man
made
he
a
woman
thus
it
appears
from
moses
representation
of
the
state
of
innocency
that
he
was
commanded
by
god
to
labor
and
to
replenish
the
earth
and
that
to
him
was
given
the
dominion
over
the
creatures
and
that
at
two
several
times
he
was
licensed
by
god
himself
to
eat
of
every
of
the
fruit
of
the
trees
and
of
the
herbage
except
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
and
because
it
was
not
good
that
the
man
should
be
alone
but
that
he
might
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
our
amorous
mother
eve
it
seems
was
formed
who
i
dare
say
well
compensated
father
adam
for
the
loss
of
his
rib
this
short
description
of
man
state
and
condition
in
innocency
agrees
with
the
state
and
circumstances
of
human
nature
at
present
innocent
man
was
required
to
labor
and
subdue
the
earth
out
of
which
he
was
to
be
subsisted
had
a
license
to
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
trees
or
herbage
of
the
garden
which
that
his
nature
needed
refreshment
the
same
as
ours
does
for
otherwise
it
would
have
been
impertinent
to
have
granted
him
a
privilege
incompatible
with
his
nature
as
it
would
have
been
no
privilege
at
all
but
an
outright
mockery
except
we
admit
that
innocent
human
nature
was
liable
to
decay
needed
nutrition
by
food
and
had
the
quality
of
digestion
and
perspiration
or
in
fine
had
the
same
sort
of
nature
as
we
have
for
otherwise
he
could
eat
but
one
which
without
digestion
would
remain
the
same
and
is
too
romantic
to
have
been
the
original
end
and
design
of
eating
and
though
there
is
nothing
mentioned
by
moses
concerning
his
drinking
yet
it
is
altogether
probable
that
he
had
wit
enough
to
drink
when
he
was
thirsty
that
he
consisted
of
animal
nature
is
manifest
not
only
from
his
being
subjected
to
subdue
the
earth
out
of
which
he
was
to
be
subsisted
and
from
his
eating
and
drinking
or
his
susceptibility
of
nutrition
by
food
but
also
from
his
propensity
to
propagate
his
kind
for
which
purpose
a
helpmate
was
made
for
him
nothing
could
more
fully
evince
that
moses
innocent
progenitors
of
mankind
in
that
state
were
of
a
similar
nature
to
ours
than
their
susceptibility
of
propagating
the
species
and
as
they
required
nutrition
their
nature
must
have
had
the
quality
or
aptitude
of
digestion
and
perspiration
and
every
property
that
at
present
we
ascribe
to
an
animal
nature
from
hence
we
infer
that
death
or
mortality
must
have
been
the
necessary
consequence
what
would
have
prevented
them
from
having
been
crushed
to
death
by
a
fall
from
a
precipice
or
from
suffering
death
by
any
other
casualty
to
which
human
nature
is
at
present
liable
will
any
suppose
that
the
bodies
of
those
premised
innocent
progenitors
of
the
human
race
were
invulnerable
were
they
not
flesh
and
blood
surely
they
were
for
otherwise
they
could
not
have
been
male
and
female
as
it
was
written
male
and
female
created
he
them
and
inasmuch
as
animal
life
has
from
its
original
consisted
of
the
same
sort
of
nature
and
been
propagated
and
supported
in
the
same
manner
and
obnoxious
to
the
same
fate
it
would
undoubtedly
in
the
premised
day
of
adam
required
the
same
order
in
the
external
system
of
nature
which
it
does
at
present
to
answer
the
purposes
of
animal
life
was
it
possible
that
the
laws
of
nature
which
merely
respect
gravitation
could
be
and
were
suspended
so
as
not
to
be
influential
on
matter
our
world
would
be
immediately
disjointed
and
out
of
order
and
confusion
would
succeed
its
present
regularity
in
the
convulsions
whereof
animal
life
could
not
subsist
so
that
not
only
the
laws
which
immediately
respect
animal
nature
in
particular
but
the
laws
which
respect
our
solar
system
must
have
been
the
same
in
man
innocency
as
in
his
whimsically
supposed
state
of
apostacy
and
consequently
his
mortality
the
same
from
hence
we
infer
that
the
curses
which
moses
informs
us
of
in
chapter
three
as
being
by
god
pronounced
upon
man
saying
dust
thou
art
and
unto
dust
thou
shalt
return
could
not
have
been
any
punishment
inflicted
as
a
penalty
for
eating
the
forbidden
fruit
for
turn
to
dust
he
must
have
done
whether
he
eat
of
it
or
not
for
that
death
and
dissolution
was
the
inevitable
and
irreversible
condition
of
the
law
of
nature
which
wholly
precludes
the
curse
of
which
moses
informs
us
from
having
any
effect
on
mankind
the
story
of
the
tree
of
life
is
unnatural
and
there
being
but
one
of
the
kind
it
may
be
called
an
only
tree
the
world
not
having
produced
another
of
the
sort
the
fruit
of
which
according
to
moses
had
such
an
efficacious
quality
that
had
adam
and
eve
but
eaten
thereof
they
would
have
lived
forever
and
now
lest
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
take
also
of
the
tree
of
life
and
eat
and
live
forever
to
prevent
which
they
are
said
to
be
driven
out
of
the
garden
that
the
eating
thereof
might
not
have
reversed
the
sentence
of
god
which
he
had
previously
pronounced
against
them
denouncing
their
mortality
so
he
drove
out
the
man
and
he
placed
at
the
east
of
the
garden
of
eden
cherubims
and
a
flaming
sword
which
turneth
every
way
to
keep
the
way
of
the
tree
of
life
a
bite
of
this
fruit
it
seems
would
have
reinstated
mankind
and
spoiled
priestcraft
yet
it
is
observable
that
there
are
no
travellers
or
historians
who
have
given
any
accounts
of
such
a
tree
or
of
the
cherubims
or
flaming
sword
which
renders
its
existence
disputable
and
the
reality
of
it
doubtful
and
improbable
the
more
so
as
that
part
of
the
country
in
which
it
is
said
to
have
been
planted
has
for
a
long
secession
of
ages
been
populously
inhabited
yet
it
may
be
objected
that
the
tree
may
have
rotted
down
and
consumed
by
time
but
such
conjectures
derogate
from
the
character
of
the
quality
of
the
tree
it
seems
that
so
marvellous
a
tree
the
fruit
of
which
would
have
preserved
animal
life
eternally
would
have
laughed
at
time
and
bid
defiance
to
decay
and
dissolution
and
eternally
have
remained
in
its
pristine
state
under
the
protection
of
the
flaming
sword
as
a
perpetual
evidence
of
the
divine
legation
of
moses
and
the
reality
of
man
apostacy
for
ever
but
alas
it
is
no
where
to
be
found
it
is
perished
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
and
such
a
marvellous
fruit
is
no
more
and
consequently
no
remedy
against
mortality
remains
secton
ii
pointing
out
the
natural
impossibility
of
all
and
every
of
the
diverse
species
of
biped
animals
commonly
termed
man
to
have
lineally
descended
from
adam
and
eve
or
from
the
same
original
progenitors
it
is
altogether
improbable
and
manifestly
contradictory
to
suppose
that
the
various
and
diverse
nations
and
tribes
of
the
earth
who
walk
upon
two
legs
and
are
included
under
the
term
man
have
or
possibly
could
have
descended
by
ordinary
generation
from
the
same
parents
be
they
supposed
to
be
who
they
will
those
adventurers
have
sailed
or
travelled
to
the
several
parts
of
the
globe
inform
us
in
their
respective
histories
that
they
find
the
habitable
part
of
it
more
or
less
populated
by
one
kind
or
other
of
rational
animals
and
that
considered
as
tribes
or
nations
there
is
evidently
a
gradation
of
intellectual
capacity
among
them
some
more
exalted
and
others
lower
in
the
scale
of
being
and
that
they
are
specially
diverse
from
each
other
with
respect
to
their
several
animal
natures
though
in
most
respects
they
appear
to
have
one
sort
of
nature
with
us
viz
more
like
us
that
like
the
brute
creation
as
they
walk
erect
speak
with
man
voice
and
make
use
of
language
of
one
sort
or
other
though
many
of
them
are
more
or
less
inarticulate
in
their
manner
of
speaking
and
in
many
other
particulars
bear
a
general
likeness
to
us
they
are
nevertheless
considered
as
distinct
tribes
or
nations
are
of
different
sizes
and
as
to
complexion
they
vary
from
the
two
extremes
of
white
and
black
in
a
variety
of
tawny
mediums
the
learned
nations
can
trace
their
genealogies
though
somewhat
incorrect
for
a
considerable
time
but
are
certain
to
be
sooner
or
later
lost
in
the
retrospect
thereon
and
those
that
are
of
an
inferior
kind
or
destitute
of
learning
or
science
have
no
other
knowledge
of
their
genealogies
than
they
retain
by
their
respective
traditions
which
are
very
inconsiderable
they
are
likewise
diverse
from
each
other
in
their
features
and
in
the
shape
of
their
bodies
and
limbs
and
some
are
distinguished
from
others
by
their
rank
smell
and
the
difference
in
their
hair
eyes
and
visage
but
to
point
out
the
distinctions
would
exceed
my
design
the
ethiopians
though
of
a
shining
black
complexion
have
regular
and
beautiful
features
and
long
black
hair
one
of
those
female
beauties
captivated
the
affections
of
moses
they
differ
very
materially
from
the
negro
blacks
so
that
it
appears
impossible
that
they
should
have
descended
in
a
lineal
succession
from
the
same
ancestors
they
are
uniformly
in
their
respective
generations
essentially
diverse
from
each
other
so
that
an
issue
from
a
male
and
female
of
the
two
nations
would
be
a
mongrel
partaking
partly
of
the
kind
of
both
nations
so
also
concerning
the
difference
which
subsists
between
us
and
the
negroes
their
black
skin
is
but
one
of
the
particulars
in
which
they
are
different
from
us
their
many
and
very
essential
differences
fully
evince
that
the
white
nations
and
they
could
not
according
to
the
law
of
their
respective
generations
have
had
one
and
the
same
lineal
original
but
that
they
have
had
their
diverse
kind
of
original
progenitors
it
is
true
that
the
several
nations
and
tribes
of
the
earth
comprehended
under
the
general
term
man
notwithstanding
their
diversity
to
each
other
in
bodily
shape
and
mental
powers
bear
a
nearer
resemblance
to
one
another
than
the
brute
kind
for
which
reason
they
are
known
by
one
common
appellation
though
it
is
manifest
that
they
could
never
have
lineally
descended
from
the
same
first
parents
whether
their
names
were
adam
and
eve
or
what
not
but
inasmuch
as
our
genealogies
are
wholly
insufficient
for
the
purpose
of
explaining
our
respective
originals
or
any
or
either
of
them
or
to
give
us
or
any
of
us
considered
as
individuals
or
nations
who
fall
under
the
denomination
of
the
term
man
any
manner
of
insight
or
knowledge
from
whom
we
are
lineally
descended
or
who
were
our
respective
original
ancestors
or
what
their
names
were
we
must
therefore
reason
on
this
subject
from
the
facts
and
causes
now
existing
which
abundantly
evince
that
we
are
of
different
kinds
and
consequently
are
not
of
the
same
lineage
the
acquaintance
which
we
have
had
with
the
negro
nation
in
particular
fully
evinces
the
absurdity
of
supposing
them
to
be
of
the
same
blood
and
kindred
with
ourselves
but
that
there
are
some
original
intrinsic
and
hereditary
diversity
or
essential
difference
between
us
and
them
which
can
not
be
ascribed
to
time
climate
or
to
mere
contingence
for
that
we
and
they
are
in
nature
inherently
and
uniformly
diverse
from
each
other
in
our
respective
constitutions
and
generations
and
have
been
so
time
immemorial
so
that
the
negroes
are
of
a
different
species
of
rational
beings
from
us
and
consequently
must
have
had
their
distinct
lineal
original
was
it
not
so
there
could
be
no
such
thing
as
a
mongrel
or
a
mulatto
who
is
occasioned
by
a
copulation
between
the
males
and
the
females
of
the
respective
diverse
species
the

partaking
of
both
natures

the

of
the

who
are
denominated

been
lineally
descended
from
the
same
progenitors
mongrelism
could
never
have
taken
place
among
them
as
in
this
case
they
would
have
been
all
of
the
same
kind
from
hence
we
infer
that
they
have
had
their
respective
original
progenitors
the
dutch
colony
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
have
enacted
laws
to
punish
with
death
such
of
their
dutch
subjects
as
may
be
convicted
of
copulating
with
the
hottentots
for
that
their
nature
is
adjusted
to
be
of
an
inferior
species
to
theirs
so
that
mixing
their
nature
with
them
would
essentially
degenerate

debase

iii
of
the
origin
of
the
devil
or
of
moral
evil
and
of
the
devil
talking
with
eve
with
a
remark
that
the
doctrine
of
apostacy
is
the
foundation
of
christianity
inasmuch
as
the
devil
is
represented
to
have
had
so
great
and
undue
an
influence
in
bringing
about
the
apostacy
of
adam
and
still
to
continue
his
temptations
to
mankind
it
may
be
worth
our
while
to
examine
into
the
nature
and
manner
of
his
being
and
the
mode
of
his
exhibiting
his
temptations
john
gospel
verse
and
the
christian
god
is
the
creator
of
the
devil
and
consequently
the
original
cause
of
evil
in
heaven
and
among
men
he
planted
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
and
knew
at
the
time
he
planted
it
of
the
awful
consequences
that
would
follow
but
if
it
be
admitted
that
the
creature
called
the
devil
who
must
be
supposed
to
be
under
the
divine
government
as
much
as
any
other
creature
could
become
inflexible
and
perpetually
rebellious
and
wicked
incapable
of
a
restoration
and
consequently
subjected
to
eternal
punishment
which
to
me
appears
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
wisdom
and
goodness
of
the
divine
government
and
the
nature
end
and
design
of
a
probationary
agent
yet
it
would
by
no
means
follow
from
hence
that
so
stubbornly
wicked
and
incorrigible
a
creature
would
have
been
permitted
by
the
providence
of
god
to
tempt
ensnare
or
seduce
mankind
by
plying
his
temptations
to
their
weak
side
one
thing
we
are
certain
of
viz
that
the
devil
does
not
visit
our
world
in
a
bodily
or
organized
shape
and
there
is
not
in
nature
a
second
way
in
which
it
is
possible
for
him
to
make
known
himself
to
us
or
that
he
could
have
done
it
to
our
progenitors
nor
could
he
ever
have
communicated
to
them
or
to
us
any
temptations
or
ideas
whatever
any
otherwise
than
by
making
a
proper
application
to
our
external
senses
so
that
we
could
understand
him
or
receive
the
ideas
of
his
temptations
in
a
natural
way
for
supernatural
intercourse
with
the
world
of
spirits
or
invisible
beings
has
been
shown
to
be
contradictory
and
impossible
in
the
arguments
contained
in
the
sixth
chapter
to
which
the
reader
is
referred
those
arguments
will
hold
equally
good
as
applied
to
either
good
or
evil
spirits
and
are
demonstrative
of
the
utter
impossibility
of
holding
any
manner
of
intercourse
or
intelligence
with
them
but
should
we
premise
that
according
to
the
history
of
moses
it
was
in
the
power
of
the
devil
to
assume
a
bodily
shape
and
that
he
did
in
very
deed
transform
himself
into
the
figure
likeness
and
organization
of
a
snake
yet
by
and
with
that
organ
he
could
not
have
spoken
or
uttered
the
following
articulate
words
which
moses
charged
him
with
to
wit
and
the
serpent
said
unto
the
woman
ye
shall
not
surely
die
for
god
doth
know
that
in
the
day
ye
eat
thereof
that
your
eyes
shall
be
opened
and
ye
shall
be
as
gods
knowing
good
and
evil
who
speaks
the
truth
in
the
above
passages
the
devil
for
neither
the
man
nor
the
woman
died
for
many
years
after
they
are
said
to
have
eaten
of
the
forbidden
fruit
for
death
is
the
annihilation
of
life
and
they
did
not
die
on
the
day
they
eat
as
the
serpent
is
by
nature
incapable
of
speech
it
must
have
put
the
devil
into
the
same
predicament
admitting
that
he
transformed
himself
into
the
same
figure
or
likeness
and
consequently
for
want
of
the
proper
and
adequate
organs
of
speech
he
must
necessarily
have
been
incapable
of
any
other
language
than
that
of
rattling
his
tail
and
therefore
could
never
have
spoken
those
recited
words
unto
eve
or
communicated
any
of
his
temptations
unto
her
by
language
while
in
that
similitude
however
admitting
that
the
first
parents
of
mankind
were
beguiled
by
the
wiles
of
the
devil
to
transgress
the
divine
law
yet
of
all
transgressions
it
would
have
been
the
most
trivial
considered
under
all
the
particular
circumstances
of
it
that
the
mind
of
man
can
conceive
of
who
in
the
exercise
of
reason
can
believe
that
adam
and
eve
by
eating
of
such
a
spontaneous
fruit
could
have
incurred
the
eternal
displeasure
of
god
as
individuals
or
that
the
divine
vindictive
justice
should
extend
to
their
unoffending
offspring
then
unborn
and
sentence
the
human
progeny
to
the
latest
posterity
to
everlasting
destruction
as
chimerical
as
moses
representation
of
the
apostacy
of
man
manifestly
appears
to
be
yet
it
is
the
very
basis
on
which
christianity
is
founded
and
is
announced
in
the
new
testament
to
be
the
very
cause
why
jesus
christ
came
into
this
world
that
he
might
destroy
the
works
of
the
devil
and
redeem
fallen
man
alias
the
elect
from
the
condemnation
of
the
apostacy
which
leads
me
to
the
consideration
of
the
doctrine
of
imputation
chapter
xi
secton
imputation
can
not
change
alienate
or
transfer
the
personal
demerit
of
sin
and
personal
merit
of
virtue
to
others
who
were
not
active
therein
although
this
doctrine
supposes
an
alienation
thereof
the
doctrine
of
imputation
according
to
the
christian
scheme
consists
of
two
parts
first
of
imputation
of
the
apostacy
of
adam
and
eve
to
their
posterity
commonly
called
original
sin
and
secondly
of
the
imputation
of
the
merits
or
righteousness
of
christ
who
in
scripture
is
called
the
second
adam
to
mankind
or
to
the
elect
this
is
a
concise
definition
of
the
doctrine
and
which
will
undoubtedly
be
admitted
to
be
a
just
one
by
every
denomination
of
men
who
are
acquainted
with
christianity
whether
they
adhere
to
it
or
not
i
therefore
proceed
to
illustrate
and
explain
the
doctrine
by
transcribing
a
short
but
very
pertinent
conversation
which
in
the
early
years
of
my
manhood
i
had
with
a
calvinistical
divine
but
previously
remark
that
i
was
educated
in
what
is
commonly
called
the
armenian
principles
and
among
other
tenets
to
reject
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
this
was
the
point
at
issue
between
the
clergyman
and
me
in
my
turn
i
opposed
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
with
philosophical
reasonings
and
as
i
thought
had
confuted
the
doctrine
the
reverend
gentleman
heard
me
through
patiently
and
with
candor
replied
your
metaphysical
reasonings
are
not
to
the
purpose
inasmuch
as
you
are
a
christian
and
hope
and
expect
to
be
saved
by
the
imputed
righteousness
of
christ
to
you
for
you
may
as
well
be
imputedly
sinful
as
imputedly
righteous
nay
said
he
if
you
hold
to
the
doctrine
of
satisfaction
and
atonement
by
christ
by
so
doing
you
the
doctrine
of
apostacy
or
original
sin
to
be
in
fact
true
for
said
he
if
mankind
were
not
in
a
ruined
and
condemned
state
by
nature
there
could
have
been
no
need
of
a
redeemer
but
each
individual
would
have
been
accountable
to
his
creator
and
judge
upon
the
basis
of
his
own
moral
agency
further
observing
that
upon
philosophical
principles
it
was
difficult
to
account
for
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
or
original
righteousness
yet
as
they
were
plain
fundamental
doctrines
of
the
christian
faith
we
ought
to
assent
to
the
truth
of
them
and
that
from
the
divine
authority
of
revelation
notwithstanding
said
he
if
you
will
give
me
a
philosophical
explanation
of
original
imputed
righteousness
which
you
profess
to
believe
and
expect
salvation
by
then
i
will
return
you
a
philosophical
explanation
of
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
for
it
is
plain
said
he
that
your
objections
lie
with
equal
weight
against
original
imputed
righteousness
as
against
original
imputed
sin
upon
which
i
had
the
candor
to
acknowledge
to
the
worthy
ecclesiastic
that
upon
the
christian
plan
i
perceived
that
the
argument
had
fairly
terminated
against
me
for
at
that
time
i
dared
not
distrust
the
infallibility
of
revelation
much
more
to
dispute
it
however
this
conversation
was
uppermost
in
my
mind
for
several
months
after
and
after
many
painful
searches
and
researches
after
the
truth
respecting
the
doctrine
of
imputation
resolved
at
all
events
to
abide
the
decision
of
rational
argument
in
the
premises
and
on
a
full
examination
of
both
parts
of
the
doctrine
rejected
the
whole
for
on
a
fair
scrutiny
i
found
that
i
must
concede
to
it
entirely
or
not
at
all
or
else
believe
inconsistently
as
the
clergyman
had
argued
having
opened
and
explained
the
doctrine
we
proceed
argumentatively
to
consider
it
imputation
of
sin
or
righteousness
includes
an
alteration
or
transferring
of
the
personal
merits
or
demerits
of
sin
or
righteousness
from
those
who
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
active
in
the
one
or
the
other
to
others
who
are
premised
not
to
have
been
active
therein
otherwise
it
would
not
answer
the
bible
notion
of
imputation
for
if
sin
or
righteousness
vice
or
virtue
are
imputable
only
to
their
respective
personal
proficients
or
actors
in
this
case
original
sin
must
have
been
imputed
to
adam
and
eve
to
the
exclusion
of
their
posterity
and
the
righteousness
of
christ
as
exclusively
imputed
to
himself
precluding
all
others
therefrom
so
that
both
the
sin
of
the
first
adam
and
the
righteousness
of
the
second
would
on
this
stating
of
imputation
have
been
matters
which
respect
merely
the
agency
of
the
demerits
or
merits
of
the
two
respective
adams
themselves
and
in
which
we
could
have
had
no
blame
reward
or
concern
any
more
than
in
the
building
of
babel
this
then
is
the
question
that
determines
the
sequel
of
the
dispute
for
or
against
the
doctrine
of
imputation
viz
whether
the
personal
merit
or
demerit
of
mankind
that
is
to
say
their
virtue
or
vice
righteousness
or
wickedness
can
be
alienated
imputed
to
or
transferred
from
one
person
to
another
or
not
if
any
should
object
against
this
stating
of
the
question
now
in
dispute
it
would
be
the
same
in
reality
as
disputing
against
the
doctrine
of
imputation
itself
for
imputation
must
transfer
or
change
the
personal
merit
or
demerit
of
the
sin
or
righteousness
of
mankind
or
not
do
it
if
it
does
not
do
it
the
whole
notion
of
original
sin
or
of
righteousness
as
being
imputed
from
the
first
and
second
adams
to
mankind
is
without
foundation
consequently
if
there
is
any
reality
in
the
doctrine
of
imputation
it
must
needs
transfer
or
change
the
guilt
of
original
sin
or
of
the
apostacy
of
adam
and
eve
to
their
posterity
or
otherwise
they
could
need
no
atonement
or
imputative
righteousness
as
a
remedy
therefrom
but
every
individual
of
mankind
would
have
stood
accountable
to
their
creator
and
judge
on
the
basis
of
their
own
moral
agency
which
is
undoubted
the
true
state
of
the
case
respecting
all
rational
and
accountable
beings
so
that
if
the
transferring
of
the
individual
merits
or
demerits
of
one
person
to
another
is
not
contained
in
the
act
or
doctrine
of
imputation
it
contains
nothing
at
all
but
is
a
sound
without
a
meaning
and
after
all
the
talk
which
has
been
in
the
world
about
it
we
must
finally
adopt
to
old
proverb
viz
every
tub
stands
upon
its
own
bottom
secton
ii
the
moral
rectitude
of
things
forecloses
the
act
of
imputation
imputation
confounds
virtue
and
vice
and
saps
the
very
foundation
of
moral
government
both
divine
and
human
abstract
the
idea
of
personal
merit
and
demerit
from
the
individuals
of
mankind
justice
would
be
totally
blind
and
truth
would
be
nullified
or
at
least
excluded
from
any
share
in
the
administration
of
government
admitting
that
moral
good
and
evil
has
taken
place
in
the
system
of
rational
agents
yet
on
the
position
of
imputation
it
would
be
impossible
that
a
retribution
of
justice
should
be
made
to
them
by
god
or
by
man
except
it
be
according
to
their
respective
personal
merits
and
demerits
which
would
fix
upon
the
basis
of
our
own
moral
agency
and
accountability
and
preclude
the
imputation
of
righteousnes
truth
respects
the
reality
of
things
as
they
are
in
their
various
complicated
and
distinct
natures
and
necessarily
conforms
to
all
facts
and
realities
it
exists
in
by
and
with
every
thing
that
does
exist
and
that
which
does
not
and
can
not
exist
is
fictitious
and
void
of
truth
as
is
the
doctrine
of
imputation
it
is
a
truth
that
some
of
the
individuals
of
mankind
are
virtuous
and
that
others
are
vicious
and
it
is
a
truth
that
the
former
merit
peace
of
conscience
and
praise
and
the
latter
horror
of
conscience
and
blame
for
god
has
so
constituted
the
nature
of
things
that
moral
goodness
naturally
and
necessarily
tends
to
happiness
in
a
moral
sense
and
moral
evil
as
necessarily
tends
to
the
contrary
and
as
truth
respects
every
thing
as
being
what
it
is
it
respects
nature
as
god
has
constituted
it
with
its
tendencies
dispositions
aptitudes
and
laws
and
as
the
tendency
of
virtue
is
to
mental
happiness
and
vice
the
contrary
they
fall
under
the
cognizance
of
truth
as
all
other
facts
necessarily
do
which
tendencies
will
for
ever
preclude
imputation
by
making
us
morally
happy
or
miserable
according
to
our
works
truth
respects
the
eternal
rules
of
unalterable
rectitude
and
fitness
which
comprehends
all
virtue
goodness
and
true
happiness
and
as
sin
and
wickedness
is
no
other
but
a
deviation
from
the
rules
of
eternal
unerring
order
and
reason
so
truth
respects
it
as
unreasonable
unfit
unrighteous
and
unhappy
deviation
from
moral
rectitude
naturally
tending
to
misery
this
order
of
nature
comprehended
under
the
terms
of
truth
must
have
been
of
all
others
the
wisest
and
best
in
fine
it
must
have
been
absolutely
perfect
for
this
order
and
harmony
of
things
could
not
have
resulted
from
anything
short
of
infinite
wisdom
goodness
and
power
by
which
it
is
also
upheld
and
all
just
ideas
of
equity
or
of
natural
and
moral
fitness
must
be
learned
from
nature
and
predicated
on
it
and
nature
predicated
on
the
immutable
perfection
of
a
god
and
to
suppose
that
imputation
in
any
one
instance
has
taken
place
is
the
same
as
to
suppose
that
the
eternal
order
truth
justice
equity
and
fitness
of
things
has
been
changed
and
if
so
the
god
of
nature
must
needs
have
been
a
changeable
being
and
liable
to
alter
his
justice
or
order
of
nature
which
is
the
same
thing
for
without
the
alteration
of
nature
and
the
tendency
of
it
there
could
be
no
such
thing
as
imputation
but
every
of
the
individuals
of
mankind
would
be
ultimately
happy
or
miserable
according
as
their
respective
proficiencies
may
be
supposed
to
be
either
good
or
evil
agreeable
to
the
order
and
tendency
of
nature
before
alluded
to
for
all
rational
and
accountable
agents
must
stand
or
fall
upon
the
principles
of
the
law
of
nature
except
imputation
alters
the
nature
and
tendency
of
things
of
which
the
immutability
of
a
god
can
not
admit
from
what
has
been
already
argued
on
this
subject
we
infer
that
as
certain
as
the
individuals
of
mankind
are
the
proprietors
of
their
own

the

are
supposed
to

passive

that
if
there

that

must
have

immediate

sovereign
act
of

the
preclusion

man

to
suppose

the
virtue

of

to
be
the
virtue

falsehood
into
truth

that
he
can
reverse
the
nature
of
moral
rectitude
itself

is
inadmissable
but
admitting
that
imputation
was
in
the
power
and
at
the
option
of
man
it
is
altogether
probable
that
they
would
have
been
very
sparing
in
imputing
merit
and
happiness
but
might
nevertheless
have
been
vastly
liberal
in
imputing
demerit
and
misery
from
one
to
another
which
is
too
farcical
secton
iii
containing
remarks
on
the
atonement
and
satisfaction
for
original
sin
the
doctrine
of
imputation
is
in
every
point
of
view
incompatible
with
the
moral
perfections
of
god
we
will
premise
that
the
race
of
adam
in
their
respective
generations
was
guilty
of
the
apostacy
and
obnoxious
to
the
vindictive
justice
and
punishment
of
god
and
accordingly
doomed
to
either
an
eternal
or
temporary
punishment
therefore
which
is
the
bible
representation
of
the
matter
what
possibility
could
there
have
been
of
reversing
the
divine
decree
it
must
be
supposed
to
have
been
just
or
it
could
not
have
had
the
divine
sanction
and
if
so
a
reversal
of
it
would
be
unjust
but
it
would
be
still
a
greater
injustice
to
lay
the
blame
and
vindictive
punishment
of
a
guilty
race
of
condemned
sinners
upon
an
innocent
and
inoffensive
being
for
in
this
case
the
guilty
would
be
exempted
from
their
just
punishment
and
the
innocent
unjustly
suffer
for
it
which
holds
up
to
view
two
manifest
injustices
the
first
consists
in
not
doing
justice
to
the
guilty
and
the
second
in
actually
punishing
the
innocent
which
instead
of
atoning
for
sin
would
add
sin
to
sin
or
injustice
to
injustice
and
after
all
if
it
was
ever
just
that
the
race
of
adam
should
have
been
punished
for
the
imputed
sin
of
their
premised
original
ancestor
be
that
punishment
what
it
will
it
is
so
still
notwithstanding
the
atonement
for
the
eternal
justice
and
reason
of
things
can
never
be
altered
this
justice
always
defeats
the
possibility
of
satisfaction
for
sin
by
way
of
a
mediator
that
physical
evils
may
and
have
been
propagated
by
natural
generation
none
can
dispute
for
that
the
facts
themselves
are
obvious
but
that
moral
evil
can
be
thus
propagated
is
altogether
chimerical
for
we
are
not
born
criminals
secton
iv
remarks
on
redemption
wrought
out
by
inflicting
the
demerits
of
sin
upon
the
innocent
would
be
unjust
and
that
it
could
contain
no
mercy
or
goodness
to
the
universality
of
being
the
practice
of
imputing
one
person
crime
to
another
in
capital
offences
among
men
so
that
the
innocent
should
suffer
for
the
guilty
has
never
yet
been
introduced
into
any
court
of
judicature
in
the
world
or
so
much
as
practised
in
any
civilized
country
and
the
manifest
reason
in
this
as
in
all
other
cases
of
imputation
is
the
same
viz
it
confounds
personal
merit
and
demerit
the
murderer
ought
to
suffer
for
the
demerit
of
his
crime
but
if
the
court
exclude
the
idea
of
personal
demerit
guilt
being
always
the
inherent
property
of
the
guilty
and
of
them
only
they
might
as
well
sentence
one
person
to
death
for
the
murder
as
another
for
justice
would
be
wholly
blind
was
it
not
predicated
on
the
idea
of
the
fact
of
a
personal
demerit
on
the
identical
person
who
was
guilty
of
the
murder
nor
is
it
possible
to
reward
merit
abstractly
considered
from
its
personal
agents
these
are
facts
that
universally
hold
good
in
human
government
the
same
reasons
can
not
fail
to
hold
good
in
the
divine
mind
as
in
that
of
the
human
for
the
rules
of
justice
are
essentially
the
same
whether
applied
to
the
one
or
to
the
other
having
their
uniformity
in
the
eternal
truth
and
reason
of
things
but
it
is
frequently
objected
that
inasmuch
as
one
person
can
pay
satisfy
and
discharge
a
cash
debt
for
another
redeem
him
from
prison
and
set
him
at
liberty
therefore
jesus
christ
might
become
responsible
for
the
sins
of
mankind
or
of
the
elect
and
by
suffering
their
punishments
atone
for
them
and
free
them
from
their
condemnation
but
it
should
be
considered
that
comparisons
darken
or
reflect
light
upon
an
argument
according
as
they
are
either
pertinent
or
impertinent
thereto
we
will
therefore
examine
the
comparison
and
see
if
it
will
with
propriety
apply
to
the
atonement
upon
the
christian
scheme
christ
the
son
was
god
and
equal
with
god
the
father
or
with
god
the
holy
ghost
and
therefore
original
sin
must
be
considered
to
be
an
offence
equally
against
each
of
the
persons
of
the
premised
trinity
and
being
of
a
criminal
nature
could
not
be
discharged
or
satisfied
by
cash
or
produce
as
debts
of
a
civil
contract
are
but
by
suffering
and
it
has
already
been
proved
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
divine
or
human
government
to
inflict
the
punishment
of
the
guilty
upon
the
innocent
though
one
man
may
discharge
another
debt
in
cases
where
lands
chattels
or
cash
are
adequate
to
it
but
what
capital
offender
was
ever
discharged
by
such
commodities
still
there
remains
a
difficulty
on
the
part
of
christianity
in
accounting
for
one
of
the
persons
in
the
premised
trinity
satisfying
a
debt
due
to
the
impartial
justice
of
the
unity
of
the
three
persons
for
god
the
son
to
suffer
the
condemnation
of
guilt
in
behalf
of
man
would
not
only
be
unjust
in
itself
but
incompatible
with
his
divinity
and
the
retribution
of
the
justice
of
the
premised
trinity
of
persons
in
the
of
whom
god
the
son
must
be
admitted
to
be
one
toward
mankind
for
this
would
be
the
same
as
to
suppose
god
to
be
judge
criminal
and
executioner
which
is
inadmissible
but
should
we
admit
for
argument
sake
that
god
suffered
for
original
sin
yet
taking
into
one
complex
idea
the
whole
mental
system
of
beings
universally
both
finite
and
infinite
there
could
have
been
no
display
of
grace
mercy
or
goodness
to
being
in
general
in
such
a
supposed
redemption
of
mankind
inasmuch
as
the
same
quantity
or
degree
of
evil
is
supposed
to
have
taken
place
upon
being
universally
considered
as
would
have
taken
place
had
finite
individuals
or
the
race
of
adam
suffered
according
to
their
respective
demerits
should
we
admit
that
there
is
a
trinity
of
persons
in
the
divine
essence
yet
the
one
could
not
suffer
without
the
other
for
essence
can
not
be
divided
in
suffering
any
more
than
in
enjoyment
the
essence
of
god
is
that
which
includes
the
divine
nature
and
the
same
identical
nature
must
necessarily
partake
of
the
same
glory
honor
power
wisdom
goodness
and
absolute
uncreated
and
unlimited
perfection
and
is
equally
exempted
from
weakness
and
suffering
therefore
as
certain
as
christ
suffered
he
was
not
god
but
whether
he
is
supposed
to
be
god
or
man
or
both
he
could
not
in
justice
have
suffered
for
original
sin
which
must
have
been
the
demerit
of
its
perpetrators
as
before
argued
supposing
christ
to
have
been
both
god
and
man
he
must
have
existed
in
two
distinct
essences
viz
the
essence
of
god
and
the
essence
of
man
and
if
he
existed
in
two
distinct
and
separate
essences
there
could
be
no
union
between
the
divine
and
human
natures
but
if
there
is
any
such
thing
as
an
hypostatical
union
between
the
divine
and
human
natures
it
must
unite
both
in
one
essence
which
is
impossible
for
the
divine
nature
being
infinite
could
admit
of
no
addition
or
enlargement
and
consequently
can
not
allow
of
a
union
with
any
nature
whatever
was
such
an
union
possible
in
itself
yet
for
a
superior
nature
to
unite
with
an
inferior
one
in
the
same
essence
would
be
degrading
to
the
former
as
it
would
put
both
natures
on
a
level
by
constituting
an
identity
of
nature
the
consequences
whereof
would
either
deify
man
or
divest
god
of
his
divinity
and
reduce
him
to
the
rank
and
condition
of
a
creature
inasmuch
as
the
united
essence
must
be
denominated
either
divine
or
human

evince

it
evinces
the

blundering
condition
in

the

often
informs
us
from

an

phantom
it

it

the

thus
the
common

by

supposed

at
secondary
hands
whether
at
the
thousandth
or
ten
thousandth
remove
from
its
first
premised
inspiration
they
know
not
can
not
in
fact
be
taught
by
the
revelation
of
god
add
to
this
the
diverse
and
clashing
expositions
of
the
bible
among
which
are
so
many
flagrant
proofs
of
the
fallibility
and
uncertainty
of
such
teachings
as
must
convince
even
bigots
that
every
one
of
these
expositions
are
erroneous
their
own
it
has
been
owing
to
different
comments
on
the
scriptures
that
christians
have
been
divided
into
sectaries
every
commentator
who
could
influence
a
party
to
embrace
his
comment
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
division
of
christians
as
luther
calvin
and
arminius
laid
the
foundation
of
the
sectaries
who
bear
their
names
and
the
socinians
were
called
after
the
scismatical
socinius
the
same
may
be
said
of
each
of
the
sectaries
thus
it
is
that
different
commentaries
or
acceptations
of
the
original
meaning
of
the
scriptures
have
divided
the
christian
world
into
divisions
and
subdivisions
of
which
it
consists
at
present
nor
was
there
ever
a
division
or
subdivision
among
jews
christians
or
mahometans
respecting
their
notions
or
opinions
of
religion
but
what
was
occasioned
by
commentating
on
the
scriptures
or
else
by
latter
pretended
inspired
revelations
from
god
in
addition
thereto
the
law
of
moses
was
the
first
pretended
immediate
revelation
from
god
which
respects
the
bible
and
after
that
in
succession
the
several
revelations
of
the
prophets
and
last
of
all
in
the
christian
system
the
revelations
of
jesus
christ
and
apostles
who
challenged
a
right
of
abolishing
the
priesthood
of
moses
christ
claiming
to
be
the
antitype
of
which
the
institution
of
sacrifices
and
ceremonial
part
of
the
law
of
moses
was
emblematical
but
this
infringement
of
the
prerogative
of
the
levitical
priests
gave
such
offence
not
only
to
them
but
to
the
jews
as
a
nation
that
they
rejected
christianity
and
have
not
subscribed
to
the
divine
authority
of
it
to
this
day
holding
to
the
law
of
moses
and
the
prophets
however
christianity
made
a
great
progress
in
the
world
and
has
been
very
much
divided
into
sectaries
by
the
causes
previously
assigned
mahomet
taking
notice
of
the
numerous
sects
and
divisions
among
christians
in
his
journies
to
palestine
c
thought
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
introduce
a
new
religion
and
make
himself
high
priest
and
sovereign
of
the
people
this
he
finally
effected
prosecuting
his
scheme
so
far
that
he
new
modelled
the
scriptures
presenting
them
as
he
said
in
their
original
purity
and
called
his
disciples
after
his
own
name
he
gained
great
numbers
of
proselytes
and
became
their
sovereign
in
civil
military
and
spiritual
matters
instituted
the
order
of
mystical
priesthood
and
gave
the
world
a
new
bible
by
the
name
of
the
alcoran
which
he
gives
us
to
understand
was
communicated
to
him
from
god
by
the
intermediate
agency
of
the
angel
gabriel
chapter
by
chapter
his
disciples
at
this
day
inhabit
a
great
part
of
the
richest
countries
in
the
world
and
are
supposed
to
be
more
numerous
than
the
christians
and
are
as
much
if
not
more
divided
into
sectaries
from
causes
similar
to
those
which
produced
the
division
of
christians
viz
the
different
commentators
on
and
expositions
of
the
alcoran
the
mufti
or
priests
represented
the
doctrines
and
precepts
of
the
alcoran
in
a
variety
of
lights
different
from
each
other
each
of
them
claiming
the
purity
of
the
original
and
infallible
truths
prescribed
to
the
world
by
mahomet
their
great
reformer
of
christianity
for
though
the
several
sectaries
of
mahometans
differ
respecting
the
meaning
of
their
alcoran
yet
they
all
hold
to
the
truth
and
divine
authority
thereof
the
same
as
the
christian
sectaries
do
concerning
their
bible
so
that
all
the
different
opinions
which
ever
did
or
at
present
do
subsist
between
jews
christians
and
mahometans
may
be
resolved
into
one
consideration
viz
the
want
of
a
right
understanding
of
the
original
of
the
scriptures
all
sat
out
at
first
as
they
imagined
from
the
truth
of
god
word
except
the
impostors
concluded
that
they
had
an
infallible
guide
and
have
by
one
means
or
other
been
guided
into
as
many
opposite
faiths
as
human
invention
has
been
of
fabricating
each
sect
among
the
whole
exulting
in
their
happy
ignorance
believing
that
they
are
favored
with
an
infallible
revelation
for
their
direction
it
alters
not
the
present
argument
whether
the
scriptures
were
originally
true
or
not
for
though
they
be
supposed
to
have
been
either
true
or
false
or
a
mixture
of
both
yet
they
could
never
have
been
handed
down
entire
and
uncorrupted
to
the
present
time
through
the
various
changes
and
perpetual
refinements
of
learning
and
language
this
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
speculative
and
argumentative
demonstration
the
palpable
certainty
of
it
stands
confessed
in
every
jewish
christian
and
mahometan
sectary

the
infallibility
of

their
chartered
rights
to

or
retain
sins
and
of
the
impropriety
of
their
being
trusted
with
a
revelation
from
god
the
manuscripts
of
scripture
which
are
said
to
have
been
originally
written
on
scrolls
of
bark
long
before
the
invention
of
paper
or

and
are
said
to
compose
our
present
bible
were
in
a
loose
and
confused
condition
scattered
about
in
the
world
deposited
nobody
knows
how
or
where
and
at
different
times
were
compiled
into
one
volume
the
four
gospels
are
by
the
learned
generally
admitted
to
have
been
wrote
many
years
after
christ
particularly
that
of
john
and
sundry
other
gospels
in
the
primitive
ages
of
christianity
were
received
as
divine
by
some
of
its
then
sectaries
which
have
unfortunately
not
met
with
approbation
in
subsequent
eras
of
the
despotism
of
the
church
the
translation
of
the
scriptures
by
ptolemy
king
of
egypt
was
before
christ
and
therefore
could
not
include
the
writings
of
the
new
testament
in
his
translation
and
whether
by
interpreters
and
in
the
manner
as
is
commonly
related
is
justly
questioned
but
where
at
what
time
and
by
whom
the
scriptures
of
the
old
and
new
testament
were
first
compiled
into
one
volume
is
what
i
do
not
understand
but
was
it
a
longer
or
shorter
period
after
christ
it
alters
not
the
present
argument
materially
since
the
scattered
manuscripts
were
in
a
loose
and
confused
condition
for
a
long
time
and
the
grand
query
is
when
the
compilers
of
those
manuscripts
collected
them
together
in
order
to
form
them
into
one
volume
how
they
could
have
understood
the
supposed
divine
writings
or
symbolical
figures
with
the
ideas
originally
connected
with
them
and
distinguish
them
from
those
which
were
merely
human
and
in
comparison
of
the
others
are
called
profane
to
understand
this
distinction
would
require
a
new
revelation
as
much
as
may
be
supposed
necessary
for
composing
the
original
manuscripts
themselves
but
it
is
not
pretended
that
the
compilers
or
translators
of
the
bible
were
inspired
by
the
divine
spirit
in
the
doing
and
completing
their
respective
business
so
that
human
reason
fancy
or
some
latent
design
must
needs
have
been
substituted
in
distinguishing
the
supposed
divine
and
human
writings
apart
and
in
giving
a
perfect
transcript
of
the
original
manuscripts
now
admitting
that
the
compilers
were
really
honest
principled
men
which
is
more
than
we
are
certain
of
it
would
follow
that
they
would
be
obliged
to
cull
out
of
the
mixed
mass
of
premised
divine
and
human
writings
such
as
to
them
appeared
to
be
divine
which
would
make
them
to
be
the
sole
arbitrators
of
the
divinity
that
they
were
compiling
to
be
handed
down
to
posterity
as
the
infallible
word
of
god
which
is
a
great
stretch
of
prerogative
for
mortal
and
fallible
man
to
undertake
and
as
great
a
weakness
in
others
to
subscribe
to
it
as
of
divine
authority
fenning
in
his
dictionary
definition
of
the
word
bible
subjoins
the
following
history
of
its
translations
the
translation
of
this
sacred
volume
was
begun
very
early
in
this
kingdom
england
and
some
part
of
it
was
done
by
king
alfred
adelmus
translated
the
psalms
into
saxon
in
other
parts
were
done
by
edfrid
or
ecbert
in
the
whole
by
bede
in
trevisa
published
the
whole
in
english
in
tindal
was
brought
higher
in
revised
and
altered
in
published
with
a
preface
of
cranmers
in
in
another
translation
was
published
which
was
revised
by
several
bishops
was
printed
with
their
alterations
in
in
a
new
translation
was
published
by
authority
which
is
that
in
present
use
from
this
account
it
appears
that
from
the
first
translation
of
the
bible
by
trevisa
into
english
in
it
has
been
revised
altered
and
passed
through
six
different
publications
the
last
of
which
is
said
to
have
been
done
by
authority
which
i
conclude
means
that
of
the
king
whose
prerogative
in
giving
us
a
divine
revelation
can
no
more
be
esteemed
valid
than
that
of
other
men
though
he
may
be
possessed
of
an
arbitrary
power
within
the
limits
of
his
realm
to
prevent
any
further
correction
and
publication
of
it
as
to
the
changes
it
underwent
previous
to
trevisa
translation
in
which
time
it
was
most
exposed
to
corruptions
of
every
kind
we
will
not
at
present
particularly
consider
but
only
observe
that
those
translations
could
not
every
one
of
them
be
perfect
since
they
were
diverse
from
each
other
in
consequence
of
their
respective
revisions
and
corrections
nor
is
it
possible
that
the
bible
in
any
of
its
various
editions
could
be
perfect
any
more
than
all
and
every
one
of
those
persons
who
have
acted
a
part
in
transmitting
them
down
to
our
time
may
be
supposed
to
be
so
for
perfection
does
not
pertain
to
man
but
is
the
essential
prerogative
of
god
the
roman
catholics
to
avoid
the
evils
of
imperfection
fallibility
and
imposture
of
man
have
set
up
the
pope
to
be
infallible
this
is
their
security
against
being
misguided
in
their
faith
and
by
ascribing
holiness
to
him
secure
themselves
from
imposture
a
deception
which
is
incompatible
with
holiness
so
that
in
matters
of
faith
they
have
nothing
more
to
do
but
to
believe
as
their
church
believes
their
authority
for
absolving
or
retaining
sins
is
very
extraordinary
however
their
charter
is
from
christ
admitting
them
to
be
his
vicars
and
the
successors
of
peter
and
the
present
english
translation
of
the
bible
warrants
it
the
commission
is
in
these
words
and
i
will
give
unto
thee
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
whoever
thou
shalt
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
heaven
and
whatsoever
thou
shall
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
heaven
whosesoever
sins
ye
remit
they
are
remitted
unto
them
and
whosesoever
sins
ye
retain
they
are
retained
that
peter
or
his
successors
should
have
a
power
of
binding
and
determining
the
state
and
condition
of
mankind
in
the
world
to
come
by
remitting
or
retaining
sins
is
too
great
a
power
to
be
intrusted
to
men
as
it
interferes
with
the
providence
and
prerogative
of
god
who
on
this
position
would
be
exempted
from
judging
the
world
as
it
would
interfere
with
the
chartered
prerogative
of
the
popes
in
their
remitting
or
retaining
of
sins
admitting
it
to
have
been
genuine
precluding
the
divine
retribution
of
justice
we
may
therefore
from
the
authority
of
reason
conclude
it
to
be
spurious
it
was
a
long
succession
of
ages
that
all
christendom
were
dupes
to
the
see
of
rome
in
which
time
it
is
too
evident
to
be
denied
that
the
holy
fathers
obtruded
a
great
deal
of
pious
fraud
on
their
devotees
all
public
worship
was
real
to
the
people
in
unknown
languages
as
it
is
to
this
day
in
roman
catholic
countries
nor
has
the
bible
in
those
countries
to
this
time
been
permitted
to
be
published
in
any
but
the
learned
languages
which
affords
great
opportunity
to
the
romish
church
to
fix
it
to
answer
their
lucrative
purposes
nor
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
they
want
the
inclination
to
do
it
the
before
recited
grant
of
the
power
of
the
absolution
of
sin
to
st
peter
in
particular
was
undoubtedly
of
their
contrivance
in
short
reason
would
prompt
us
to
conclude
that
had
god
in
very
deed
made
a
revelation
of
his
mind
and
will
to
mankind
as
a
rule
of
duty
and
practice
to
them
and
to
be
continued
as
such
to
the
latest
posterity
he
would
in
the
course
of
his
providence
have
ordered
matters
so
that
it
should
have
been
deposited
translated
and
kept
in
the
hands
of
men
of
a
more
unexceptionable
character
than
those
holy
cheats
can
pretend
to
witchcraft
and
priestcraft
were
introduced
into
this
world
together
in
its
and
has
gone
on
hand
in
hand
together
until
about
half
a
century
past
when
witchcraft
began
to
be
discredited
and
is
at
present
almost
exploded
both
in
europe
and
america
this
discovery
has
depreciated
priestcraft
on
the
scale
of
at
least
fifty
per
cent
per
annum
and
rendered
it
highly
probable
that
the
improvement
of
succeeding
generations
in
the
knowledge
of
nature
and
science
will
exalt
the
reason
of
mankind
above
the
tricks
and
impostures
of
priests
and
bring
them
back
to
the
religion

nature

truth
ennoble
their
minds
and
be
the
means
of
cultivating
concord
and
mutual
love
in
society

of
extending
charity
and
good
will
to
all
intelligent
beings
throughout
the
universe
exalt
the
divine
character
and
lay
a
permanent
foundation
for
truth
and
reliance

our
hopes

can
never
be
completed
while
we

it
is
congenial
with
reason
and
truth
can
not
like
other
revelations
partake
of
imposture
this
is
natural
religion
and
could
be
derived
from
none
other
but
god
i
have
endeavored
in
this
treatise
to
prune
this
religion
from
those
excrescences
with
which
craft
on
the
one
hand
and
ignorance
on
the
other
have
loaded
it
and
to
hold
it
up
to
view
in
its
native
simplicity
free
from
alloy
and
have
throughout
the
contents
of
the
volume
addressed
the
reason
of
mankind
and
not
their
passions
traditions
or
prejudices
for
which
cause
it
is
noways
probable
that
it
will
meet
with
any
considerable
approbation
most
of
the
human
race
by
one
means
or
other
are
prepossessed
with
principles
opposed
to
the
religion
of
reason
in
these
parts
of
america
they
are
most
generally
taught
that
they
are
born
into
the
world
in
a
state
of
enmity
to
god
and
moral
good
and
are
under
his
wrath
and
curse
that
the
way
to
heaven
and
future
blessedness
is
out
of
their
power
to
pursue
and
that
it
is
incumbered
with
mysteries
which
none
but
the
priests
can
unfold
that
we
must
be
born
again
have
a
special
kind
of
faith
and
be
regenerated
or
in
fine
that
human
nature
which
they
call
the
old
man
must
be
destroyed
perverted
or
changed
by
them
and
by
them
new
modelled
before
it
can
be
admitted
into
the
heavenly
kingdom
such
a
plan
of
superstition
as
far
as
it
obtains
credit
in
the
world
subjects
mankind
to
sacerdotal
empire
which
is
erected
on
the
imbecility
of
human
nature
such
of
mankind
as
break
the
fetters
of
their
education
remove
such
other
obstacles
as
are
in
their
way
and
have
the
confidence
publicly
to
talk
rational
exalt
reason
to
its
just
supremacy
and
vindicate
truth
and
the
ways
of
god
providence
to
men
are
sure
to
be
stamped
with
the
epithet
of
irreligious
infidel
profane
and
the
like
but
it
is
often
observed
of
such
a
man
that
he
is
morally
honest
and
as
often
replied
what
of
that
morality
will
carry
no
man
to
heaven
so
that
all
the
satisfaction
the
honest
man
can
have
while
the
superstitious
are
squibbling
hell
fire
at
him
is
to
retort
back
upon
them
that
they
are
priest
ridden
the
manner
of
the
existence
and
intercourse
of
human
souls
after
the
dissolution
of
their
bodies
by
death
being
inconceiveable
to
us
in
this
life
and
fill
manner
of
intelligence
between
us
and
departed
souls
impracticable
the
priests
have
it
in
their
power
to
amuse
us
with
a
great
variety
of
visionary
apprehensions
of
things
in
the
world
to
come
which
while
in
this
life
we
can
not
contradict
from
experience
the
test
of
great
part
of
our
certainty
especially
to
those
of
ordinary
understandings
and
having
introduced
mysteries
into
their
religion
make
it
as
incomprehensible
to
us
in
this
natural
state
as
the
manner
of
our
future
existence
and
from
scripture
authority
having
invalidated
reason
as
being
carnal
and
depraved
they
proceed
further
to
teach
us
from
the
same
authority
that
the
natural
man
knoweth
not
of
the
spirit
for
they
are
foolishness
unto
him
neither
can
he
know
them
for
they
are
spiritually
discerned
a
spiritualizing
teacher
is
nearly
as
well
acquainted
with
the
kingdom
of
heaven
as
a
man
can
be
with
his
home
lot
he
knows
the
road
to
heaven
and
eternal
blessedness
to
which
happy
regions
with
the
greatest
assurance
he
presumes
to
pilot
his
dear
disciples
and
unfold
to
them
the
mysteries
of
the
canonical
writings
and
of
the
world
to
come
they
catch
the
enthusiasm
and
see
with
the
same
sort
of
spiritual
eyes
with
which
they
can
pierce
religion
through
and
through
and
understand
the
spiritual
meaning
of
the
scriptures
which
before
had
been
a
dead
letter
to
them
particularly
the
revelations
of
john
the
divine
and
the
allusion
of
the
horns
therein
mentioned
the
most
obscure
and
unintelligible
passages
of
the
bible
come
within
the
compass
of
their
spiritual
discerning
as
apparently
as
figures
do
to
a
mathmetician
then
they
can
sing
songs
out
of
the
canticles
saying
i
am
my
beloved
and
my
beloved
is
mine
and
being
at
a
loose
from
the
government
of
reason
please
themselves
with
any
fanaticisms
they
like
best
as
that
of
their
being
snatched
as
brands
out
of
the
burning
to
enjoy
the
special
and
eternal
favor
of
god
not
from
any
worthiness
or
merit
in
them
but
merely
from
the
sovereign
will
and
pleasure
of
god
while
millions
of
millions
as
good
by
nature
and
practice
as
they
were
left
to
welter
eternally
under
the
scalding
drops
of
divine
vengeance
not
considering
that
if
it
was
consistent
with
the
perfections
of
god
to
save
them
his
salvation
could
not
fail
to
have
been
uniformly
extended
to
all
others
whose
circumstances
may
be
supposed
to
be
similar
to
or
more
deserving
than
theirs
for
equal
justice
can
not
fail
to
apply
in
all
cases
in
which
equal
justice
demands
it
but
these
deluded
people
resolve
the
divine
government
altogether
into
sovereignty
even
so
father
for
so
it
seemed
good
in
thy
sight
and
as
they
exclude
reason
and
justice
from
their
imaginary
notions
of
religion
they
also
exclude
it
from
the
providence
or
moral
government
of
god
nothing
is
more
common
in
the
part
of
the
country
where
i
was
educated
than
to
hear
those
infatuated
people
in
their
public
and
private
addresses
acknowledge
to
their
creator
from
the
desk
and
elsewhere
hadst
thou
o
lord
laid
judgment
to
the
line
and
righteousness
to
the
plummet
we
had
been
in
the
grave
with
the
dead
and
in
hell
with
the
damned
long
before
this
time
such
expressions
from
the
creature
to
the
creator
are
profane
and
utterly
incompatible
with
the
divine
character
undoubtedly
all
things
complexly
considered
the
providence
of
god
to
man
is
just
inasmuch
as
it
has
the
divine
approbation
the
superstitious
thus
set
up
a
spiritual
discerning
independent
of
and
in
opposition
to
reason
and
their
mere
imaginations
pass
with
each
other
and
with
themselves
for
infallible
truth
hence
it
is
that
they
despise
the
progressive
and
wearisome
reasonings
of
philosophers
which
must
be
admitted
to
be
a
painful
method
of
arriving
at
truth
but
as
it
is
the
only
way
in
which
we
can
acquire
it
i
have
pursued
the
old
natural
road
of
ratiocination
concluding
that
as
this
spiritual
discerning
is
altogether
inadequate
to
the
management
of
any
of
the
concerns
of
life
or
of
contributing
any
assistance
or
knowledge
towards
the
perfecting
of
the
arts
and
sciences
it
is
equally
unintelligible
and
insignificant
in
matters
of
religion
and
therefore
conclude
that
if
the
human
race
in
general
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
exercise
common
sense
in
religious
concerns
those
spiritual
fictions
would
cease
and
be
succeeded
by
reason
and
truth
secton
ii
of
the
importance
of
the
exercise
of
reason
and
practice
of
morality
in
order
to
the
happiness
of
mankind
the
period
of
life
is
very
uncertain
and
at
the
longest
is
but
short
a
few
years
bring
us
from
infancy
to
manhood
a
few
more
to
a
dissolution
pain
sickness
and
death
are
the
necessary
consequences
of
animal
life
through
life
we
struggle
with
physical
evils
which
eventually
are
certain
to
destroy
our
earthly
composition
and
well
would
it
be
for
us
did
evils
end
here
but
alas
moral
evil
has
been
more
or
less
predominant
in
our
agency
and
though
natural
evil
is
unavoidable
yet
moral
evil
may
be
prevented
or
remedied
by
the
exercise
of
virtue
morality
is
therefore
of
more
importance
to
us
than
any
or
all
other
attainments
as
it
is
a
habit
of
mind
which
from
a
retrospective
consciousness
of
our
agency
in
this
life
we
should
carry
with
us
into
our
succeeding
state
of
existence
as
an
acquired
appendage
of
our
rational
nature
and
as
the
necessary
means
of
our
mental
happiness
virtue
and
vice
are
the
only
things
in
this
world
which
with
our
souls
are
capable
of
surviving
death
the
former
is
the
rational
and
only
procuring
cause
of
all
intellectual
happiness
and
the
latter
of
conscious
guilt
and
misery
and
therefore
our
indispensable
duty
and
ultimate
interest
is
to
love
cultivate
and
improve
the
one
as
the
means
of
our
greatest
good
and
to
hate
and
abstain
from
the
other
as
productive
of
our
greatest
evil
and
in
order
thereto
we
should
so
far
divest
ourselves
of
the
incumbrances
of
this
world
which
are
too
apt
to
engross
our
attention
as
to
inquire
a
consistent
system
of
the
knowledge
of
religious
duty
and
make
it
our
constant
endeavor
in
life
to
act
conformably
to
it
the
knowledge
of
the
being
perfections
creation
and
providence
of
god
and
of
the
immortality
of
our
souls
is
the
foundation
of
religion
which
has
been
particularly
illustrated
in
the
four
first
chapters
of
this
discourse
and
as
the
pagan
jewish
christian
and
mahometan
countries
of
the
world
have
been
overwhelmed
with
a
multiplicity
of
revelations
diverse
from
each
other
and
which
by
their
respective
promulgators
are
said
to
have
been
immediately
inspired
into
their
souls
by
the
spirit
of
god
or
immediately
communicated
to
them
by
the
intervening
agency
of
angels
as
in
the
instance
of
the
invisible
gabriel
to
mahomet
and
as
those
revelations
have
been
received
and
credited
by
afar
the
greater
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
several
countries
of
the
world
on
whom
they
have
been
obtruded
as
revealed
by
god
or
angels
and
which
in
doctrine
and
discipline
are
in
most
respects
repugnant
to
each
other
it
fully
evinces
their
imposture
and
authorizes
us
without
a
lengthy
course
of
arguing
to
determine
with
certainty
that
not
one
of
them
had
their
original
from
god
as
they
clash
with
each
other
which
is
ground
of
high
probability
against
the
authenticity
of
each
of
them
a
revelation
that
may
be
supposed
to
be
really
of
the
institution
of
god
must
also
be
supposed
to
be
perfectly
consistent
or
uniform
and
to
be
able
to
stand
the
test
of
truth
therefore
such
pretended
revelations
as
are
tendered
to
us
as
the
contrivance
of
heaven
which
do
not
tear
that
test
we
may
be
morally
certain
was
either
originally
a
deception
or
has
since
by
adulteration
become
spurious
reason
therefore
must
be
the
standard
by
which
we
determine
the
respective
claims
of
revelation
for
otherwise
we
may
as
well
subscribe
to
the
divinity
of
the
one
as
of
the
other
or
to
the
whole
of
them
or
to
none
at
all
so
likewise
on
this
thesis
if
reason
rejects
the
whole
of
those
revelations
we
ought
to
return
to
the
religion
of
nature
and
reason
undoubtedly
it
is
our
duty
and
for
our
best
good
that
we
occupy
and
improve
the
faculties
with
which
our
creator
has
endowed
us
but
so
far
as
prejudice
or
prepossession
of
opinion
prevails
over
our
minds
in
the
same
proportion
reason
is
excluded
from
our
theory
or
practice
therefore
if
we
would
acquire
useful
knowledge
we
must
first
divest
ourselves
of
those
impediments
and
sincerely
endeavor
to
search
out
the
truth
and
draw
our
conclusions
from
reason
and
just
argument
which
will
never
conform
to
our
inclination
interest
or
fancy
but
we
must
conform
to
that
if
we
would
judge
rightly
as
certain
as
we
determine
contrary
to
reason
we
make
a
wrong
conclusion
therefore
our
wisdom
is
to
conform
to
the
nature
and
reason
of
things
as
well
in
religious
matters
as
in
other
sciences
preposterously
absurd
would
it
be
to
negative
the
exercise
of
reason
in
religious
concerns
and
yet
be
actuated
by
it
in
all
other
and
less
occurrences
of
life
all
our
knowledge
of
things
is
derived
from
god
in
and
by
the
order
of
nature
out
of
which
we
can
not
perceive
reflect
or
understand
any
thing
whatsoever
our
external
senses
are
natural
and
those
objects
are
also
natural
so
that
ourselves
and
all
things
about
us
and
our
knowledge
collected
therefrom
is
natural
and
not
supernatural
as
argued
in
the
fifth
chapter
an
unjust
composition
never
fails
to
contain
error
and
falsehood
therefore
an
unjust
connection
of
ideas
is
not
derived
from
nature
but
from
the
imperfect
composition
of
man
misconnection
of
ideas
is
the
same
as
misjudging
and
has
no
positive
existence
being
merely
a
creature
of
the
imagination
but
nature
and
truth
are
real
and
uniform
and
the
rational
mind
by
reasoning
discerns
the
uniformity
and
is
thereby
enabled
to
make
a
just
composition
of
ideas
which
will
stand
the
test
of
truth
but
the
fantastical
illuminations
of
the
credulous
and
superstitious
part
of
mankind
proceed
from
weakness
and
as
far
as
they
take
place
in
the
world
subvert
the
religion
of
reason
nature
and
truth
