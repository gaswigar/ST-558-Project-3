all

who
find
some
favourite
system
to
their
mind
in
every
point
to
make
it
fit
will
force
all
nature
to
submit
p

f
a
c
e
to
headlong
hall
and
the
three
novels
published
along
with
it
in
all
these
little
publications
appeared
originally
without
prefaces
i
left
them
to
speak
for
themselves
and
i
thought
i
might
very
fitly
preserve
my
own
impersonality
having
never
intruded
on
the
personality
of
others
nor
taken
any
liberties
but
with
public
conduct
and
public
opinions
but
an
old
friend
assures
me
that
to
publish
a
book
without
a
preface
is
like
entering
a
without
making
a
bow
in
deference
to
this
opinion
though
i
am
not
quite
clear
of
its
soundness
i
make
my
prefatory
bow
at
this
eleventh

headlong
hall
was
written
in
nightmare
abbey
in
maid
marian
with
the
exception
of
the
last
three
chapters
in
crotchet
castle
in
i
am
desirous
to
note
the
intervals
because
at
each
of
those
periods
things
were
true
in
great
matters
and
in
small
which
are
true
no
longer
headlong
hall
begins
with
the
holyhead
mail
and
crotchet
castle
ends
with
a
rotten
borough
the
holyhead
mail
no
longer
keeps
the
same
hours
nor
stops
at
the
capel
cerig
inn
which
the
progress
of
improvement
has
thrown
out
of
the
road
and
the
rotten
boroughs
of
have
ceased
to
exist
though
there
are
some
very
pretty
pocket
properties
which
are
their
worthy
successors
but
the
classes
of
tastes
feelings
and
opinions
which
were
successively
brought
into
play
in
these
little
tales
remain
substantially
the
same
perfectibilians
deteriorationists
phrenologists
transcendentalists
political
economists
theorists
in
all
sciences
projectors
in
all
arts
morbid
visionaries
romantic
enthusiasts

of

lovers
of
the
picturesque
and
lovers
of
good
dinners
march
and
will
march
for
ever
with
the
march
of
mechanics
which
some
facetiously
call
the
march
of
the
intellect
the
fastidious
in
old
wine
are
a
race
that
does
not
decay
literary
violators
of
the
confidences
of
private
life
still
gain
a
disreputable
livelihood
and
an
unenviable
notoriety
from
interest
and
the
disappointed
in
love
and
in
friendship
are
varieties
of
which
specimens
are
extant
the
great
principle
of
the
right
of
might
is
as
flourishing
now
as
in
the
days
of
maid
marian
the
array
of
false
pretensions
moral
political
and
literary
is
as
imposing
as
ever
the
rulers
of
the
world
still
feel
things
in
their
effects
and
never
foresee
them
in
their
causes
and
political
mountebanks
continue
and
will
continue
to
puff
nostrums
and
practise
legerdemain
under
the
eyes
of
the
multitude
following
like
the
learned
friend
of
crotchet
castle
a
course
as
tortuous
as
that
of
a
river
but
in
a
reverse
process
beginning
by
being
dark
and
deep
and
ending
by
being
transparent

of

h

a
d
l
o
n
g
h
a
l
l
chapter
i
the
mail
the
ambiguous
light
of
a
december
morning
peeping
through
the
windows
of
the
holyhead
mail
dispelled
the
soft
visions
of
the
four
insides
who
had
slept
or
seemed
to
sleep
through
the
first
seventy
miles
of
the
road
with
as
much
comfort
as
may
be
supposed
consistent
with
the
jolting
of
the
vehicle
and
an
occasional
admonition
to
the
thundered
through
the
open
door
accompanied
by
the
gentle
breath
of
boreas
into
the
ears
of
the
drowsy
traveller
a
lively
remark
that
day
was
none
of
the
having
elicited
a
repartee
of
the
the
various
knotty
points
of
meteorology
which
usually
form
the
exordium
of
an
english
conversation
were
successively
discussed
and
exhausted
and
the
ice
being
thus
broken
the
colloquy
rambled
to
other
topics
in
the
course
of
which
it
appeared
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
that
all
four
though
perfect
strangers
to
each
other
were
actually
bound
to
the
same
point
namely
headlong
hall
the
seat
of
the
ancient
and
honourable
family
of
the
headlongs
of
the
vale
of
llanberris
in
caernarvonshire
this
name
may
appear
at
first
sight
not
to
be
truly
cambrian
like
those
of
the
rices
and
prices
and
morgans
and
owens
and
williamses
and
evanses
and
parrys
and
joneses
but
nevertheless
the
headlongs
claim
to
be
not
less
genuine
derivatives
from
the
antique
branch
of
cadwallader
than
any
of
the
last
named
multiramified
families
they
claim
indeed
by
one
account
superior
antiquity
to
all
of
them
and
even
to
cadwallader
himself
a
tradition
having
been
handed
down
in
headlong
hall
for
some
few
thousand
years
that
the
founder
of
the
family
was
preserved
in
the
deluge
on
the
summit
of
snowdon
and
took
the
name
of
rhaiader
which
signifies
a
in
consequence
of
his
having
accompanied
the
water
in
its
descent
or
diminution
till
he
found
himself
comfortably
seated
on
the
rocks
of
llanberris
but
in
later
days
when
commercial
bagmen
began
to
scour
the
country
the
ambiguity
of
the
sound
induced
his
descendants
to
drop
the
suspicious
denomination
of
and
translate
the
word
into
english
when
not
being
well
pleased
with
the
sound
of
the
they
substituted
that
of
the
and
accordingly
adopted
the
name
the
appropriate
epithet
of
waterfall
i
can
not
tell
how
the
truth
may
be
i
say
the
tale
as
was
said
to
me
the
present
representative
of
this
ancient
and
dignified
house
harry
headlong
esquire
was
like
all
other
welsh
squires
fond
of
shooting
hunting
racing
drinking
and
other
such
innocent
amusements
d
allou
as
menander
expresses
it
but
unlike
other
welsh
squires
he
had
actually
suffered
certain
phenomena
called
books
to
find
their
way
into
his
house
and
by
dint
of
lounging
over
them
after
dinner
on
those
occasions
when
he
was
compelled
to
take
his
bottle
alone
he
became
seized
with
a
violent
passion
to
be
thought
a
philosopher
and
a
man
of
taste
and
accordingly
set
off
on
an
expedition
to
oxford
to
inquire
for
other
varieties
of
the
same
genera
namely
men
of
taste
and
philosophers
but
being
assured
by
a
learned
professor
that
there
were
no
such
things
in
the
university
he
proceeded
to
london
where
after
beating
up
in
several
booksellers
shops
theatres
and
other
resorts
of
literature
and
taste
he
formed
as
extensive
an
acquaintance
with
philosophers
and
dilettanti
as
his
utmost
ambition
could
desire
and
it
now
became
his
chief
wish
to
have
them
all
together
in
headlong
hall
arguing
over
his
old
port
and
burgundy
the
various
knotty
points
which
had
puzzled
his
pericranium
he
had
therefore
sent
them
invitations
in
due
form
to
pass
their
christmas
at
headlong
hall
which
invitations
the
extensive
fame
of
his
kitchen
fire
had
induced
the
greater
part
of
them
to
accept
and
four
of
the
chosen
guests
had
from
different
parts
of
the
metropolis
ensconced
themselves
in
the
four
corners
of
the
holyhead
mail
these
four
persons
were
mr
foster
the
perfectibilian
mr
escot
the
deteriorationist
mr
jenkison
the
and
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
who
though
of
course
neither
a
philosopher
nor
a
man
of
taste
had
so
won
on
the
squire
fancy
by
a
learned
dissertation
on
the
art
of
stuffing
a
turkey
that
he
concluded
no
christmas
party
would
be
complete
without
him
the
conversation
among
these
illuminati
soon
became
animated
and
mr
foster
who
we
must
observe
was
a
thin
gentleman
about
thirty
years
of
age
with
an
aquiline
nose
black
eyes
white
teeth
and
black
hair
took
occasion
to
panegyrize
the
vehicle
in
which
they
were
then
travelling
and
observed
what
remarkable
improvements
had
been
made
in
the
means
of
facilitating
intercourse
between
distant
parts
of
the
kingdom
he
held
forth
with
great
energy
on
the
subject
of
roads
and
railways
canals
and
tunnels
manufactures
and
machinery
in
short
said
he
every
thing
we
look
on
attests
the
progress
of
mankind
in
all
the
arts
of
life
and
demonstrates
their
gradual
advancement
towards
a
state
of
unlimited
perfection
mr
escot
who
was
somewhat
younger
than
mr
foster
but
rather
more
pale
and
saturnine
in
his
aspect
here
took
up
the
thread
of
the
discourse
observing
that
the
proposition
just
advanced
seemed
to
him
perfectly
contrary
to
the
true
state
of
the
case
for
said
he
these
improvements
as
you
call
them
appear
to
me
only
so
many
links
in
the
great
chain
of
corruption
which
will
soon
fetter
the
whole
human
race
in
irreparable
slavery
and
incurable
wretchedness
your
improvements
proceed
in
a
simple
ratio
while
the
factitious
wants
and
unnatural
appetites
they
engender
proceed
in
a
compound
one
and
thus
one
generation
acquires
fifty
wants
and
fifty
means
of
supplying
them
are
invented
which
each
in
its
turn
engenders
two
new
ones
so
that
the
next
generation
has
a
hundred
the
next
two
hundred
the
next
four
hundred
till
every
human
being
becomes
such
a
helpless
compound
of
perverted
inclinations
that
he
is
altogether
at
the
mercy
of
external
circumstances
loses
all
independence
and
singleness
of
character
and
degenerates
so
rapidly
from
the
primitive
dignity
of
his
sylvan
origin
that
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
indulge
in
any
other
expectation
than
that
the
whole
species
must
at
length
be
exterminated
by
its
own
infinite
imbecility
and
vileness
your
opinions
said
mr
jenkison
a
little
gentleman
of
about
seem
to
differ
i
have
often
debated
the
matter
in
my
own
mind
and
and
have
at
length
arrived
at
this
conclusion
that
there
is
not
in
the
human
race
a
tendency
either
to
moral
perfectibility
or
deterioration
but
that
the
quantities
of
each
are
so
exactly
balanced
by
their
reciprocal
results
that
the
species
with
respect
to
the
sum
of
good
and
evil
knowledge
and
ignorance
happiness
and
misery
remains
exactly
and
perpetually
statu
surely
said
mr
foster
you
can
not
maintain
such
a
proposition
in
the
face
of
evidence
so
luminous
look
at
the
progress
of
all
the
arts
and
sciences
see
chemistry
botany
astronomy
surely
said
mr
escot
experience
deposes
against
you
look
at
the
rapid
growth
of
corruption
luxury
selfishness
really
gentlemen
said
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
after
clearing
the
husk
in
his
throat
with
two
or
three
hems
this
is
a
very
sceptical
and
i
must
say
atheistical
conversation
and
i
should
have
thought
out
of
respect
to
my
cloth
here
the
coach
stopped
and
the
coachman
opening
the
door
vociferated
breakfast
gentlemen
a
sound
which
so
gladdened
the
ears
of
the
divine
that
the
alacrity
with
which
he
sprang
from
the
vehicle
superinduced
a
distortion
of
his
ankle
and
he
was
obliged
to
limp
into
the
inn
between
mr
escot
and
mr
jenkison
the
former
observing
that
he
ought
to
look
for
nothing
but
evil
and
therefore
should
not
be
surprised
at
this
little
accident
the
latter
remarking
that
the
comfort
of
a
good
breakfast
and
the
pain
of
a
sprained
ankle
pretty
exactly
balanced
each
other
chapter
ii
the
squire
the
breakfast
squire
headlong
in
the
meanwhile
was
quadripartite
in
his
locality
that
is
to
say
he
was
superintending
the
operations
in
four
scenes
of
action
namely
the
cellar
the
library
the
and
the
preparing
for
the
reception
of
his
philosophical
and
dilettanti
visitors
his
myrmidon
on
this
occasion
was
a
little
butler
whom
nature
seemed
to
have
cast
in
the
genuine
mould
of
an
antique
silenus
and
who
waddled
about
the
house
after
his
master
wiping
his
forehead
and
panting
for
breath
while
the
latter
bounced
from
room
to
room
like
a
cracker
and
was
indefatigable
in
his
requisitions
for
the
proximity
of
his
vinous
achates
whose
advice
and
he
deemed
no
less
necessary
in
the
library
than
in
the
cellar
multitudes
of
packages
had
arrived
by
land

at

as

in

in

kitchen
hampers
of

in

and
fiddles
and
in
the

the
servants
unpacking
all
these
in
furious
haste
and
flying
with
them
from
place
to
place
according
to
the
tumultuous
directions
of
squire
headlong
and
the
little
fat
butler
who
fumed
at
his
heels
chafed
and
crossed
and
clashed
and
tumbled
over
one
another
up
stairs
and
down
all
was
bustle
uproar
and
confusion
yet
nothing
seemed
to
advance
while
the
rage
and
impetuosity
of
the
squire
continued
fermenting
to
the
highest
degree
of
exasperation
which
he
signified
from
time
to
time
by
converting
some
newly
unpacked
article
such
as
a
book
a
bottle
a
ham
or
a
fiddle
into
a
missile
against
the
head
of
some
unfortunate
servant
who
did
not
seem
to
move
in
a
ratio
of
velocity
corresponding
to
the
intensity
of
his
master
desires
in
this
state
of
eager
preparation
we
shall
leave
the
happy
inhabitants
of
headlong
hall
and
return
to
the
three
philosophers
and
the
unfortunate
divine
whom
we
left
limping
with
a
sprained
ankle
into
the
of
the
inn
where
his
two
supporters
deposited
him
safely
in
a
large
with
his
wounded
leg
comfortably
stretched
out
on
another
the
morning
being
extremely
cold
he
contrived
to
be
seated
as
near
the
fire
as
was
consistent
with
his
other
object
of
having
a
perfect
command
of
the
table
and
its
apparatus
which
consisted
not
only
of
the
ordinary
comforts
of
tea
and
toast
but
of
a
delicious
supply
of
eggs
and
a
magnificent
round
of
beef
against
which
mr
escot
immediately
pointed
all
the
artillery
of
his
eloquence
declaring
the
use
of
animal
food
conjointly
with
that
of
fire
to
be
one
of
the
principal
causes
of
the
present
degeneracy
of
mankind
the
natural
and
original
man
said
he
lived
in
the
woods
the
roots
and
fruits
of
the
earth
supplied
his
simple
nutriment
he
had
few
desires
and
no
diseases
but
when
he
began
to
sacrifice
victims
on
the
altar
of
superstition
to
pursue
the
goat
and
the
deer
and
by
the
pernicious
invention
of
fire
to
pervert
their
flesh
into
food
luxury
disease
and
premature
death
were
let
loose
upon
the
world
such
is
clearly
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
fable
of
prometheus
which
is
the
symbolical
portraiture
of
that
disastrous
epoch
when
man
first
applied
fire
to
culinary
purposes
and
thereby
surrendered
his
liver
to
the
vulture
of
disease
from
that
period
the
stature
of
mankind
has
been
in
a
state
of
gradual
diminution
and
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
that
it
will
continue
to
grow
by
degrees
and
lamentably
till
the
whole
race
will
vanish
imperceptibly
from
the
face
of
the
earth
i
can
not
agree
said
mr
foster
in
the
consequences
being
so
very
disastrous
i
admit
that
in
some
respects
the
use
of
animal
food
retards
though
it
can
not
materially
inhibit
the
perfectibility
of
the
species
but
the
use
of
fire
was
indispensably
necessary
as
aeschylus
and
virgil
expressly
assert
to
give
being
to
the
various
arts
of
life
which
in
their
rapid
and
interminable
progress
will
finally
conduct
every
individual
of
the
race
to
the
philosophic
pinnacle
of
pure
and
perfect
felicity
in
the
controversy
concerning
animal
and
vegetable
food
said
mr
jenkison
there
is
much
to
be
said
on
both
sides
and
the
question
being
in
equipoise
i
content
myself
with
a
mixed
diet
and
make
a
point
of
eating
whatever
is
placed
before
me
provided
it
be
good
in
its
kind
in
this
opinion
his
two
brother
philosophers
practically
coincided
though
they
both
ran
down
the
theory
as
highly
detrimental
to
the
best
interests
of
man
i
am
really
astonished
said
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
gracefully
picking
off
the
supernal
fragments
of
an
egg
he
had
just
cracked
and
clearing
away
a
space
at
the
top
for
the
reception
of
a
small
piece
of
butter
i
am
really
astonished
gentlemen
at
the
very
heterodox
opinions
i
have
heard
you
deliver
since
nothing
can
be
more
obvious
than
that
all
animals
were
created
solely
and
exclusively
for
the
use
of
man
even
the
tiger
that
devours
him
said
mr
escot
certainly
said
doctor
gaster
how
do
you
prove
it
said
mr
escot
it
requires
no
proof
said
doctor
gaster
it
is
a
point
of
doctrine
it
is
written
therefore
it
is
so
nothing
can
be
more
logical
said
mr
jenkison
it
has
been
said
continued
he
that
the
ox
was
expressly
made
to
be
eaten
by
man
it
may
be
said
by
a
parity
of
reasoning
that
man
was
expressly
made
to
be
eaten
by
the
tiger
but
as
wild
oxen
exist
where
there
are
no
men
and
men
where
there
are
no
tigers
it
would
seem
that
in
these
instances
they
do
not
properly
answer
the
ends
of
their
creation
it
is
a
mystery
said
doctor
gaster
not
to
launch
into
the
question
of
final
causes
said
mr
escot
helping
himself
at
the
same
time
to
a
slice
of
beef
concerning
which
i
will
candidly
acknowledge
i
am
as
profoundly
ignorant
as
the
most
dogmatical
theologian
possibly
can
be
i
just
wish
to
observe
that
the
pure
and
peaceful
manners
which
homer
ascribes
to
the
lotophagi
and
which
at
this
day
characterise
many
nations
the
hindoos
for
example
who
subsist
exclusively
on
the
fruits
of
the
earth
depose
very
strongly
in
favour
of
a
vegetable
regimen
it
may
be
said
on
the
contrary
said
mr
foster
that
animal
food
acts
on
the
mind
as
manure
does
on
flowers
forcing
them
into
a
degree
of
expansion
they
would
not
otherwise
have
attained
if
we
can
imagine
a
philosophical
auricula
falling
into
a
train
of
theoretical
meditation
on
its
original
and
natural
nutriment
till
it
should
work
itself
up
into
a
profound
abomination
of
bullock
blood
scum
and
other
ingredients
of
that
rich
composition
of
soil
which
had
brought
it
to
perfection
and
insist
on
being
planted
in
common
earth
it
would
have
all
the
advantage
of
natural
theory
on
its
side
that
the
most
strenuous
advocate
of
the
vegetable
system
could
desire
but
it
would
soon
discover
the
practical
error
of
its
retrograde
experiment
by
its
lamentable
inferiority
in
strength
and
beauty
to
all
the
auriculas
around
it
i
am
afraid
in
some
instances
at
least
this
analogy
holds
true
with
respect
to
mind
no
one
will
make
a
comparison
in
point
of
mental
power
between
the
hindoos
and
the
ancient
greeks
the
anatomy
of
the
human
stomach
said
mr
escot
and
the
formation
of
the
teeth
clearly
place
man
in
the
class
of
frugivorous
animals
many
anatomists
said
mr
foster
are
of
a
different
opinion
and
agree
in
discerning
the
characteristics
of
the
carnivorous
classes
i
am
no
anatomist
said
mr
jenkison
and
can
not
decide
where
doctors
disagree
in
the
meantime
i
conclude
that
man
is
omnivorous
and
on
that
conclusion
i
act
your
conclusion
is
truly
orthodox
said
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
indeed
the
loaves
and
fishes
are
typical
of
a
mixed
diet
and
the
practice
of
the
church
in
all
ages
shows
that
it
never
loses
sight
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
said
mr
escot
it
never
loses
sight
of
any
point
of
sound
doctrine
said
the
reverend
doctor
the
coachman
now
informed
them
their
time
was
elapsed
nor
could
all
the
pathetic
remonstrances
of
the
reverend
divine
who
declared
he
had
not
half
breakfasted
succeed
in
gaining
one
minute
from
the
inexorable
jehu
you
will
allow
said
mr
foster
as
soon
as
they
were
again
in
motion
that
the
wild
man
of
the
woods
could
not
transport
himself
over
two
hundred
miles
of
forest
with
as
much
facility
as
one
of
these
vehicles
transports
you
and
me
through
the
heart
of
this
cultivated
country
i
am
certain
said
mr
escot
that
a
wild
man
can
travel
an
immense
distance
without
fatigue
but
what
is
the
advantage
of
locomotion
the
wild
man
is
happy
in
one
spot
and
there
he
remains
the
civilised
man
is
wretched
in
every
place
he
happens
to
be
in
and
then
congratulates
himself
on
being
accommodated
with
a
machine
that
will
whirl
him
to
another
where
he
will
be
just
as
miserable
as
ever
we
shall
now
leave
the
to
find
its
way
to
capel
cerig
the
nearest
point
of
the
holyhead
road
to
the
dwelling
of
squire
headlong
chapter
iii
the
arrivals
in
the
midst
of
that
scene
of
confusion
thrice
confounded
in
which
we
left
the
inhabitants
of
headlong
hall
arrived
the
lovely
caprioletta
headlong
the
squire
sister
whom
he
had
sent
for
from
the
residence
of
her
maiden
aunt
at
caernarvon
to
do
the
honours
of
his
house
beaming
like
light
on
chaos
to
arrange
disorder
and
harmonise
discord
the
tempestuous
spirit
of
her
brother
became
instantaneously
as
smooth
as
the
surface
of
the
lake
of
llanberris
and
the
little
fat
butler
plessed
cot
and
st
tafit
and
the
peautiful
tamsel
for
being
permitted
to
move
about
the
house
in
his
natural
pace
in
less
than
hours
after
her
arrival
everything
was
disposed
in
its
proper
station
and
the
squire
began
to
be
all
impatience
for
the
appearance
of
his
promised
guests
the
first
visitor
with
whom
he
had
the
felicity
of
shaking
hands
was
marmaduke
milestone
esquire
who
arrived
with
a
portfolio
under
his
arm
mr
milestone
was
a
picturesque
landscape
gardener
of
the
first
celebrity
who
was
not
without
hopes
of
persuading
squire
headlong
to
put
his
romantic
under
a
process
of
improvement
promising
himself
a
signal
triumph
for
his
incomparable
art
in
the
difficult
and
therefore
glorious
achievement
of
polishing
and
trimming
the
rocks
of
llanberris
next
arrived
a
from
the
inn
at
capel
cerig
containing
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
it
appeared
that
when
the
deposited
its
valuable
cargo
early
on
the
second
morning
at
the
inn
at
capel
cerig
there
was
only
one
to
be
had
it
was
therefore
determined
that
the
reverend
doctor
and
the
luggage
should
proceed
in
the
chaise
and
that
the
three
philosophers
should
walk
when
the
reverend
gentleman
first
seated
himself
in
the
chaise
the
windows
were
down
all
round
but
he
allowed
it
to
drive
off
under
the
idea
that
he
could
easily
pull
them
up
this
task
however
he
had
considerable
difficulty
in
accomplishing
and
when
he
had
succeeded
it
availed
him
little
for
the
frames
and
glasses
had
long
since
discontinued
their
ancient
familiarity
he
had
however
no
alternative
but
to
proceed
and
to
comfort
himself
as
he
went
with
some
choice
quotations
from
the
book
of
job
the
road
led
along
the
edges
of
tremendous
chasms
with
torrents
dashing
in
the
bottom
so
that
if
his
teeth
had
not
chattered
with
cold
they
would
have
done
so
with
fear
the
squire
shook
him
heartily
by
the
hand
and
congratulated
him
on
his
safe
arrival
at
headlong
hall
the
doctor
returned
the
squeeze
and
assured
him
that
the
congratulation
was
by
no
means
misapplied
next
came
the
three
philosophers
highly
delighted
with
their
walk
and
full
of
rapturous
exclamations
on
the
sublime
beauties
of
the
scenery
the
doctor
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
and
confessed
he
preferred
the
scenery
of
putney
and
kew
where
a
man
could
go
comfortably
to
sleep
in
his
chaise
without
being
in
momentary
terror
of
being
hurled
headlong
down
a
precipice
mr
milestone
observed
that
there
were
great
capabilities
in
the
scenery
but
it
wanted
shaving
and
polishing
if
he
could
but
have
it
under
his
care
for
a
single
twelvemonth
he
assured
them
no
one
would
be
able
to
know
it
again
mr
jenkison
thought
the
scenery
was
just
what
it
ought
to
be
and
required
no
alteration
mr
foster
thought
it
could
be
improved
but
doubted
if
that
effect
would
be
produced
by
the
system
of
mr
milestone
mr
escot
did
not
think
that
any
human
being
could
improve
it
but
had
no
doubt
of
its
having
changed
very
considerably
for
the
worse
since
the
days
when
the
now
barren
rocks
were
covered
with
the
immense
forest
of
snowdon
which
must
have
contained
a
very
fine
race
of
wild
men
not
less
than
ten
feet
high
the
next
arrival
was
that
of
mr
cranium
and
his
lovely
daughter
miss
cephalis
cranium
who
flew
to
the
arms
of
her
dear
friend
caprioletta
with
all
that
warmth
of
friendship
which
young
ladies
usually
assume
towards
each
other
in
the
presence
of
young
gentlemen
miss
cephalis
blushed
like
a
carnation
at
the
sight
of
mr
escot
and
mr
escot
glowed
like
a
at
the
sight
of
miss
cephalis
it
was
at
least
obvious
to
all
observers
that
he
could
imagine
the
possibility
of
one
change
for
the
better
even
in
this
terrestrial
theatre
of
universal
deterioration
mr
cranium
eyes
wandered
from
mr
escot
to
his
daughter
and
from
his
daughter
to
mr
escot
and
his
complexion
in
the
course
of
the
scrutiny
underwent
several
variations
from
the
dark
red
of
the
peony
to
the
deep
blue
of
the
convolvulus
mr
escot
had
formerly
been
the
received
lover
of
miss
cephalis
till
he
incurred
the
indignation
of
her
father
by
laughing
at
a
very
profound
craniological
dissertation
which
the
old
gentleman
delivered
nor
had
mr
escot
yet
discovered
the
means
of
mollifying
his
wrath
mr
cranium
carried
in
his
own
hands
a
bag
the
contents
of
which
were
too
precious
to
be
intrusted
to
any
one
but
himself
and
earnestly
entreated
to
be
shown
to
the
chamber
appropriated
for
his
reception
that
he
might
deposit
his
treasure
in
safety
the
little
butler
was
accordingly
summoned
to
conduct
him
to
his
next
arrived
a
carrying
four
insides
whose
extreme
thinness
enabled
them
to
travel
thus
economically
without
experiencing
the
slightest
inconvenience
these
four
personages
were
two
very
profound
critics
mr
gall
and
mr
treacle
who
followed
the
trade
of
reviewers
but
occasionally
indulged
themselves
in
the
composition
of
bad
poetry
and
two
very
multitudinous
versifiers
mr
nightshade
and
mr
mac
laurel
who
followed
the
trade
of
poetry
but
occasionally
indulged
themselves
in
the
composition
of
bad
criticism
mr
nightshade
and
mr
mac
laurel
were
the
two
senior
lieutenants
of
a
very
formidable
corps
of
critics
of
whom
timothy
treacle
esquire
was
captain
and
geoffrey
gall
esquire
generalissimo
the
last
arrivals
were
mr
cornelius
chromatic
the
most
profound
and
scientific
of
all
amateurs
of
the
fiddle
with
his
two
blooming
daughters
miss
tenorina
and
miss
graziosa
sir
patrick
a
dilettante
painter
of
high
renown
and
his
maiden
aunt
miss
philomela
poppyseed
an
indefatigable
compounder
of
novels
written
for
the
express
purpose
of
supporting
every
species
of
superstition
and
prejudice
and
mr
panscope
the
chemical
botanical
geological
astronomical
mathematical
metaphysical
meteorological
anatomical
physiological
galvanistical
musical
pictorial
bibliographical
critical
philosopher
who
had
run
through
the
whole
circle
of
the
sciences
and
understood
them
all
equally
well
mr
milestone
was
impatient
to
take
a
walk
round
the
grounds
that
he
might
examine
how
far
the
system
of
clumping
and
levelling
could
be
carried
advantageously
into
effect
the
ladies
retired
to
enjoy
each
other
society
in
the
first
happy
moments
of
meeting
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
sat
by
the
library
fire
in
profound
meditation
over
a
volume
of
the
des
mr
panscope
sat
in
the
opposite
corner
with
a
volume
of
rees
cyclopaedia
mr
cranium
was
busy
upstairs
mr
chromatic
retreated
to
the
where
he
fiddled
through
a
book
of
solos
before
the
ringing
of
the
first
dinner
bell
the
remainder
of
the
party
supported
mr
milestone
proposition
and
accordingly
squire
headlong
and
mr
milestone
leading
the
van
they
commenced
their
perambulation
chapter
iv
the
grounds
i
perceive
said
mr
milestone
after
they
had
walked
a
few
paces
these
grounds
have
never
been
touched
by
the
finger
of
taste
the
place
is
quite
a
wilderness
said
squire
headlong
for
during
the
latter
part
of
my
father
life
while
i
was
my
he
troubled
himself
about
nothing
but
the
cellar
and
suffered
everything
else
to
go
to
rack
and
ruin
a
mere
wilderness
as
you
see
even
now
in
december
but
in
summer
a
complete
nursery
of
briers
a
forest
of
thistles
a
plantation
of
nettles
without
any
live
stock
but
goats
that
have
eaten
up
all
the
bark
of
the
trees
here
you
see
is
the
pedestal
of
a
statue
with
only
half
a
leg
and
four
toes
remaining
there
were
many
here
once
when
i
was
a
boy
i
used
to
sit
every
day
on
the
shoulders
of
hercules
what
became
of
i
have
never
been
able
to
ascertain
neptune
has
been
lying
these
seven
years
in
the
atlas
had
his
head
knocked
off
to
fit
him
for
propping
a
shed
and
only
the
day
before
yesterday
we
fished
bacchus
out
of
the
my
dear
sir
said
mr
milestone
accord
me
your
permission
to
wave
the
wand
of
enchantment
over
your
grounds
the
rocks
shall
be
blown
up
the
trees
shall
be
cut
down
the
wilderness
and
all
its
goats
shall
vanish
like
mist
pagodas
and
chinese
bridges
gravel
walks
and
shrubberies
canals
and
clumps
of
larch
shall
rise
upon
its
ruins
one
age
sir
has
brought
to
light
the
treasures
of
ancient
learning
a
second
has
penetrated
into
the
depths
of
metaphysics
a
third
has
brought
to
perfection
the
science
of
astronomy
but
it
was
reserved
for
the
exclusive
genius
of
the
present
times
to
invent
the
noble
art
of
picturesque
gardening
which
has
given
as
it
were
a
new
tint
to
the
complexion
of
nature
and
a
new
outline
to
the
physiognomy
of
the
universe
give
me
leave
said
sir
patrick
to
take
an
exception
to
that
same
your
system
of
levelling
and
trimming
and
clipping
and
docking
and
clumping
and
polishing
and
cropping
and
shaving
destroys
all
the
beautiful
intricacies
of
natural
luxuriance
and
all
the
graduated
harmonies
of
light
and
shade
melting
into
one
another
as
you
see
them
on
that
rock
over
yonder
i
never
saw
one
of
your
improved
places
as
you
call
them
and
which
are
nothing
but
big
like
sheets
of
green
paper
with
a
parcel
of
round
clumps
scattered
over
them
like
so
many
spots
of
ink
flicked
at
random
out
of
a
pen
and
a
solitary
animal
here
and
there
looking
as
if
it
were
lost
that
i
did
not
think
it
was
for
all
the
world
like
hounslow
heath
thinly
sprinkled
over
with
bushes
and
highwaymen
sir
said
mr
milestone
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
picturesque
and
the
beautiful
will
i
said
sir
patrick
och
but
i
wo
for
what
is
beautiful
that
what
pleases
the
eye
and
what
pleases
the
eye
tints
variously
broken
and
blended
now
tints
variously
broken
and
blended
constitute
the
picturesque
allow
me
said
mr
gall
i
distinguish
the
picturesque
and
the
beautiful
and
i
add
to
them
in
the
laying
out
of
grounds
a
third
and
distinct
character
which
i
call
pray
sir
said
mr
milestone
by
what
name
do
you
distinguish
this
character
when
a
person
walks
round
the
grounds
for
the
second
time
mr
gall
bit
his
lips
and
inwardly
vowed
to
revenge
himself
on
milestone
by
cutting
up
his
next
publication
a
long
controversy
now
ensued
concerning
the
picturesque
and
the
beautiful
highly
edifying
to
squire
headlong
the
three
philosophers
stopped
as
they
wound
round
a
projecting
point
of
rock
to
contemplate
a
little
boat
which
was
gliding
over
the
tranquil
surface
of
the
lake
below
the
blessings
of
civilisation
said
mr
foster
extend
themselves
to
the
meanest
individuals
of
the
community
that
boatman
singing
as
he
sails
along
is
i
have
no
doubt
a
very
happy
and
comparatively
to
the
men
of
his
class
some
centuries
back
a
very
enlightened
and
intelligent
man
as
a
partisan
of
the
system
of
the
moral
perfectibility
of
the
human
race
said
mr
escot
who
was
always
for
considering
things
on
a
large
scale
and
whose
thoughts
immediately
wandered
from
the
lake
to
the
ocean
from
the
little
boat
to
a
ship
of
the
line
you
will
probably
be
able
to
point
out
to
me
the
degree
of
improvement
that
you
suppose
to
have
taken
place
in
the
character
of
a
sailor
from
the
days
when
jason
sailed
through
the
cyanean
symplegades
or
noah
moored
his
ark
on
the
summit
of
ararat
if
you
talk
to
me
said
mr
foster
of
mythological
personages
of
course
i
can
not
meet
you
on
fair
grounds
we
will
begin
if
you
please
then
said
mr
escot
no
further
back
than
the
battle
of
salamis
and
i
will
ask
you
if
you
think
the
mariners
of
england
are
in
any
one
respect
morally
or
intellectually
superior
to
those
who
then
preserved
the
liberties
of
greece
under
the
direction
of
themistocles
i
will
venture
to
assert
said
mr
foster
that
considered
merely
as
sailors
which
is
the
only
fair
mode
of
judging
them
they
are
as
far
superior
to
the
athenians
as
the
structure
of
our
ships
is
superior
to
that
of
theirs
would
not
one
english
think
you
have
been
sufficient
to
have
sunk
burned
and
put
to
flight
all
the
persian
and
grecian
vessels
in
that
memorable
bay
contemplate
the
progress
of
naval
architecture
and
the
slow
but
immense
succession
of
concatenated
intelligence
by
which
it
has
gradually
attained
its
present
stage
of
perfectibility
in
this
as
in
all
other
branches
of
art
and
science
every
generation
possesses
all
the
knowledge
of
the
preceding
and
adds
to
it
its
own
discoveries
in
a
progression
to
which
there
seems
no
limit
the
skill
requisite
to
direct
these
immense
machines
is
proportionate
to
their
magnitude
and
complicated
mechanism
and
therefore
the
english
sailor
considered
merely
as
a
sailor
is
vastly
superior
to
the
ancient
greek
you
make
a
distinction
of
course
said
mr
escot
between
scientific
and
moral
perfectibility
i
conceive
said
mr
foster
that
men
are
virtuous
in
proportion
as
they
are
enlightened
and
that
as
every
generation
increases
in
knowledge
it
also
increases
in
virtue
i
wish
it
were
so
said
mr
escot
but
to
me
the
very
reverse
appears
to
be
the
fact
the
progress
of
knowledge
is
not
general
it
is
confined
to
a
chosen
few
of
every
age
how
far
these
are
better
than
their
neighbours
we
may
examine
by
and
bye
the
mass
of
mankind
is
composed
of
beasts
of
burden
mere
clods
and
tools
of
their
superiors
by
enlarging
and
complicating
your
machines
you
degrade
not
exalt
the
human
animals
you
employ
to
direct
them
when
the
boatswain
of
a
pipes
all
hands
to
the
main
tack
and
flourishes
his
rope
end
over
the
shoulders
of
the
poor
fellows
who
are
tugging
at
the
ropes
do
you
perceive
so
dignified
so
gratifying
a
picture
as
ulysses
exhorting
his
dear
friends
his
eriaeres
to
ply
their
oars
with
energy
you
will
say
ulysses
was
a
fabulous
character
but
the
economy
of
his
vessel
is
drawn
from
nature
every
man
on
board
has
a
character
and
a
will
of
his
own
he
talks
to
them
argues
with
them
convinces
them
and
they
obey
him
because
they
love
him
and
know
the
reason
of
his
orders
now
as
i
have
said
before
all
singleness
of
character
is
lost
we
divide
men
into
herds
like
cattle
an
individual
man
if
you
strip
him
of
all
that
is
extraneous
to
himself
is
the
most
wretched
and
contemptible
creature
on
the
face
of
the
earth
the
sciences
advance
true
a
few
years
of
study
puts
a
modern
mathematician
in
possession
of
more
than
newton
knew
and
leaves
him
at
leisure
to
add
new
discoveries
of
his
own
agreed
but
does
this
make
him
a
newton
does
it
put
him
in
possession
of
that
range
of
intellect
that
grasp
of
mind
from
which
the
discoveries
of
newton
sprang
it
is
mental
power
that
i
look
for
if
you
can
demonstrate
the
increase
of
that
i
will
give
up
the
field
energy
independence
individuality
disinterested
virtue
active
benevolence
universal
philanthropy
these
are
the
qualities
i
desire
to
find
and
of
which
i
contend
that
every
succeeding
age
produces
fewer
examples
i
repeat
it
there
is
scarcely
such
a
thing
to
be
found
as
a
single
individual
man
a
few
classes
compose
the
whole
frame
of
society
and
when
you
know
one
of
a
class
you
know
the
whole
of
it
give
me
the
wild
man
of
the
woods
the
original
unthinking
unscientific
unlogical
savage
in
him
there
is
at
least
some
good
but
in
a
civilised
sophisticated
mechanical
calculating
slave
of
mammon
and
the
world
there
is
none
absolutely
none
sir
if
i
fall
into
a
river
an
unsophisticated
man
will
jump
in
and
bring
me
out
but
a
philosopher
will
look
on
with
the
utmost
calmness
and
consider
me
in
the
light
of
a
projectile
and
making
a
calculation
of
the
degree
of
force
with
which
i
have
impinged
the
surface
the
resistance
of
the
fluid
the
velocity
of
the
current
and
the
depth
of
the
water
in
that
particular
place
he
will
ascertain
with
the
greatest
nicety
in
what
part
of
the
mud
at
the
bottom
i
may
probably
be
found
at
any
given
distance
of
time
from
the
moment
of
my
first
immersion
mr
foster
was
preparing
to
reply
when
the
first
rang
and
he
immediately
commenced
a
precipitate
return
towards
the
house
followed
by
his
two
companions
who
both
admitted
that
he
was
now
leading
the
way
to
at
least
a
temporary
period
of
physical
amelioration
but
alas
added
mr
escot
after
a
reflection
epulae

the

the
sun
was
now
terminating
his
diurnal
course
and
the
lights
were
glittering
on
the
festal
board
when
the
ladies
had
retired
and
the
burgundy
had
taken
two
or
three
tours
of
the
table
the
following
conversation
took
place
push
about
the

mr
escot
it
stands
with
you
no

to

mac
really
squire
headlong
this
is
the
vara
nectar
itsel
ye
hae
saretainly
discovered
the
tarrestrial
paradise
but
it
flows
wi
a
better
leecor
than
milk
an
honey
reverend
doctor
hem
mr
mac
laurel
there
is
a
degree
of
profaneness
in
that
observation
which
i
should
not
have
looked
for
in
so
staunch
a
supporter
of
church
and
state
milk
and
honey
was
the
pure
food
of
the
antediluvian
patriarchs
who
knew
not
the
use
of
the
grape
happily
for
off
a
bumper
of
happy
indeed
the
first
inhabitants
of
the
world
knew
not
the
use
either
of
wine
or
animal
food
it
is
therefore
by
no
means
incredible
that
they
lived
to
the
age
of
several
centuries
free
from
war
and
commerce
and
arbitrary
government
and
every
other
species
of
desolating
wickedness
but
man
was
then
a
very
different
animal
to
what
he
now
is
he
had
not
the
faculty
of
speech
he
was
not
encumbered
with
clothes
he
lived
in
the
open
air
his
first
step
out
of
which
as
hamlet
truly
observes
is
his
his
first
dwellings
of
course
were
the
hollows
of
trees
and
rocks
in
process
of
time
he
began
to
build
thence
grew
villages
thence
grew
cities
luxury
oppression
poverty
misery
and
disease
kept
pace
with
the
progress
of
his
pretended
improvements
till
from
a
free
strong
healthy
peaceful
animal
he
has
become
a
weak
distempered
cruel
carnivorous
slave
reverend
doctor
your
doctrine
is
orthodox
in
so
far
as
you
assert
that
the
original
man
was
not
encumbered
with
clothes
and
that
he
lived
in
the
open
air
but
as
to
the
faculty
of
speech
that
it
is
certain
he
had
for
the
authority
of
moses
of
course
sir
i
do
not
presume
to
dissent
from
the
very
exalted
authority
of
that
most
enlightened
astronomer
and
profound
cosmogonist
who
had
moreover
the
advantage
of
being
inspired
but
when
i
indulge
myself
with
a
ramble
in
the
fields
of
speculation
and
attempt
to
deduce
what
is
probable
and
rational
from
the
sources
of
analysis
experience
and
comparison
i
confess
i
am
too
often
apt
to
lose
sight
of
the
doctrines
of
that
great
fountain
of
theological
and
geological
philosophy
push
about
the
bottle
do
you
suppose
the
mere
animal
life
of
a
wild
man
living
on
acorns
and
sleeping
on
the
ground
comparable
in
felicity
to
that
of
a
newton
ranging
through
unlimited
space
and
penetrating
into
the
arcana
of
universal
motion
to
that
of
a
locke
unravelling
the
labyrinth
of
mind
to
that
of
a
lavoisier
detecting
the
minutest
combinations
of
matter
and
reducing
all
nature
to
its
elements
to
that
of
a
shakespeare
piercing
and
developing
the
springs
of
passion
or
of
a
milton
identifying
himself
as
it
were
with
the
beings
of
an
invisible
world
you
suppose
extreme
cases
but
on
the
score
of
happiness
what
comparison
can
you
make
between
the
tranquil
being
of
the
wild
man
of
the
woods
and
the
wretched
and
turbulent
existence
of
milton
the
victim
of
persecution
poverty
blindness
and
neglect
the
records
of
literature
demonstrate
that
happiness
and
intelligence
are
seldom
sisters
even
if
it
were
otherwise
it
would
prove
nothing
the
many
are
always
sacrificed
to
the
few
where
one
man
advances
hundreds
retrograde
and
the
balance
is
always
in
favour
of
universal
deterioration
virtue
is
independent
of
external
circumstances
the
exalted
understanding
looks
into
the
truth
of
things
and
in
its
own
peaceful
contemplations
rises
superior
to
the
world
no
philosopher
would
resign
his
mental
acquisitions
for
the
purchase
of
any
terrestrial
good
in
other
words
no
man
whatever
would
resign
his
identity
which
is
nothing
more
than
the
consciousness
of
his
perceptions
as
the
price
of
any
acquisition
but
every
man
without
exception
would
willingly
effect
a
very
material
change
in
his
relative
situation
to
other
individuals
unluckily
for
the
rest
of
your
argument
the
understanding
of
literary
people
is
for
the
most
part
as
you
express
it
not
so
much
by
the
love
of
truth
and
virtue
as
by
arrogance
and
and
there
is
perhaps
less
disinterestedness
less
liberality
less
general
benevolence
and
more
envy
hatred
and
uncharitableness
among
them
than
among
any
other
description
of
men
eye
of
mr
escot
as
he
pronounced
these
words
rested
very
innocently
and
unintentionally
on
mr
you
allude
sir
i
presume
to
my
review
pardon
me
sir
you
will
be
convinced
it
is
impossible
i
can
allude
to
your
review
when
i
assure
you
that
i
have
never
read
a
single
page
of
it
gall
mr
treacle
mr
nightshade
and
mr
mac
never
read
our
review
never
i
look
on
periodical
criticism
in
general
to
be
a
species
of
shop
where
panegyric
and
defamation
are
sold
wholesale
retail
and
for
exportation
i
am
not
inclined
to
be
a
purchaser
of
these
commodities
or
to
encourage
a
trade
which
i
consider
pregnant
with
mischief
mac
i
can
readily
conceive
sir
ye
wou
na
wullingly
encoorage
ony
dealer
in
panegeeric
but
frae
the
manner
in
which
ye
speak
o
the
first
creetics
an
scholars
o
the
age
i
shou
think
ye
wou
hae
a
leetle
mair
predilaction
for
deefamation
i
have
no
predilection
sir
for
defamation
i
make
a
point
of
speaking
the
truth
on
all
occasions
and
it
seldom
happens
that
the
truth
can
be
spoken
without
some
stricken
deer
pronouncing
it
a
libel
you
are
perhaps
sir
an
enemy
to
literature
in
general
if
i
were
sir
i
should
be
a
better
friend
to
periodical
critics
buz
may
i
simply
take
the
liberty
to
inquire
into
the
basis
of
your
objection
i
conceive
that
periodical
criticism
disseminates
superficial
knowledge
and
its
perpetual
adjunct
vanity
that
it
checks
in
the
youthful
mind
the
habit
of
thinking
for
itself
that
it
delivers
partial
opinions
and
thereby
misleads
the
judgment
that
it
is
never
conducted
with
a
view
to
the
general
interests
of
literature
but
to
serve
the
interested
ends
of
individuals
and
the
miserable
purposes
of
party
mac
ye
ken
sir
a
mon
mun
leeve
while
he
can
live
honourably
naturally
justly
certainly
no
longer
mac
every
mon
sir
leeves
according
to
his
ain
notions
of
honour
justice
there
is
a
wee
defference
amang
the
learned
wi
respact
to
the
defineetion
o
the
terms
i
believe
it
is
generally
admitted
that
one
of
the
ingredients
of
justice
is
disinterestedness
mac
it
is
na
admetted
sir
amang
the
pheelosophers
of
edinbroo
that
there
is
ony
sic
thing
as
desenterestedness
in
the
warld
or
that
a
mon
can
care
for
onything
sae
much
as
his
ain
sel
for
ye
mun
observe
sir
every
mon
has
his
ain
parteecular
feelings
of
what
is
gude
beautifu
an
consentaneous
to
his
ain
indiveedual
nature
desires
to
see
every
thing
aboot
him
in
that
parteecular
state
which
is
maist
conformable
to
his
ain
notions
o
the
moral
an
poleetical
fetness
o
things
twa
men
sir
shall
purchase
a
piece
o
grund
atween
and
ae
mon
shall
cover
his
half
wi
a
park
beautifully
laid
out
in
lawns
and
clumps
with
a
belt
of
trees
at
the
circumference
and
an
artificial
lake
in
the
centre
mac
exactly
sir
an
shall
keep
it
a
for
his
ain
sel
an
the
other
mon
shall
divide
his
half
into
leetle
farms
of
twa
or
three
acres
like
those
of
the
roman
republic
and
build
a
cottage
on
each
of
them
and
cover
his
land
with
a
simple
innocent
and
smiling
population
who
shall
owe
not
only
their
happiness
but
their
existence
to
his
benevolence
mac
exactly
sir
an
ye
will
ca
the
first
mon
selfish
an
the
second
desenterested
but
the
pheelosophical
truth
is
semply
this
that
the
ane
is
pleased
wi
looking
at
trees
an
the
other
wi
seeing
people
happy
an
comfortable
it
is
aunly
a
matter
of
indiveedual
feeling
a
paisant
saves
a
mon
life
for
the
same
reason
that
a
hero
or
a
footpad
cuts
his
thrapple
an
a
pheelosopher
delevers
a
mon
frae
a
preson
for
the
same
reason
that
a
tailor
or
a
prime
meenester
puts
him
into
it
because
it
is
conformable
to
his
ain
parteecular
feelings
o
the
moral
an
poleetical
fetness
o
things
wake
the
reverend
doctor
doctor
the
bottle
stands
with
you
reverend
doctor
it
is
an
error
of
which
i
am
seldom
guilty
mac
noo
ye
ken
sir
every
mon
is
the
centre
of
his
ain
system
endaivours
as
much
as
possible
to
adapt
every
thing
aroond
him
to
his
ain
parteecular
views
thus
sir
i
presume
it
suits
the
particular
views
of
a
poet
at
one
time
to
take
the
part
of
the
people
against
their
oppressors
and
at
another
to
take
the
part
of
the
oppressors
against
the
people
mac
ye
mun
alloo
sir
that
poetry
is
a
sort
of
ware
or
commodity
that
is
brought
into
the
public
market
wi
a
other
descreptions
of
merchandise
an
that
a
mon
is
pairfectly
justified
in
getting
the
best
price
he
can
for
his
article
noo
there
are
three
reasons
for
taking
the
part
o
the
people
the
first
is
when
general
leeberty
public
happiness
are
conformable
to
your
ain
parteecular
feelings
the
moral
an
poleetical
fetness
o
things
the
second
is
when
they
happen
to
be
as
it
were
in
a
state
of
exceetabeelity
an
ye
think
ye
can
get
a
gude
price
for
your
commodity
by
flingin
in
a
leetle
seasoning
o
pheelanthropy
an
republican
speerit
the
third
is
when
ye
think
ye
can
bully
the
menestry
into
gieing
ye
a
place
or
a
pansion
to
hau
your
din
an
in
that
case
ye
point
an
attack
against
them
within
the
pale
o

agree
with
mr

in
his
definition
of

disinterestedness
every
man
actions
are
determined
by
his
peculiar
views
and
those
views
are
determined
by
the
organisation
of
his
skull
a
man
in
whom
the
organ
of
benevolence
is
not
developed
can
not
be
benevolent
he
in
whom
it
is
so
can
not
be
otherwise
the
organ
of
is
prodigiously
developed
in
the
greater
number
of
subjects
that
have
fallen
under
my
observation
much
less
i
presume
among
savage
than
civilised
men
who
only
to
the
love
of
self
and
consistent
only
in
their
aim
to
deceive
are
always
actuated
by
the
hope
of
personal
advantage
or
by
the
dread
of
personal
very
probably
you
have
of
course
found
very
copious
specimens
of
the
organs
of
hypocrisy
destruction
and
avarice
secretiveness
destructiveness
and
covetiveness
you
may
add
if
you

i

the
tree

till
he
had
tasted
the
forbidden
fruit
at
which
period
probably
the
organ

was
added
to
his
anatomy
as
a
punishment
for
his
transgression

could
not
have
been
a
more

mr

i

its

the

a

fear
indeed
it
operates
as
a
considerable
check
to
the
progress
of
the

yet
many
great

have
been
of
opinion
that
it
exalts

the

arguitur

i
conceive
the
use
of
wine
to
be
always
pernicious
in
excess

often
useful
in
moderation
it
certainly
kills
some
but
it
saves
the
lives
of
others
i
find
that
an
occasional
glass
taken
with
judgment
and
caution
has
a
very
salutary
effect
in
maintaining
that
equilibrium
of
the

which
it
is
always
my
aim

this

profound

every
thing
which
the
gentleman
on
the
other
side
of

table
has
thought
proper
to
advance
on
the
subject
of
human
deterioration
and
i
must
take
the
liberty
to
remark
that
it
augurs
a
very
considerable
degree
of
presumption
in
any
individual
to
set
himself
up
against
the
of
so
many

be
marshalled

as
dr

observed
on

similar
occasion
to
furnish
you
with

i

you
would
have
some
difficulty
in

such
an

from

do
you

only
question

from

observe
sir
that
my

perfectly

correct

i

demonstrated
what
i
shall
now
take
the

in
plain

that

that
apology

quite
sufficient
apology
sir
even
so
sir
you
have
lost

i
consider
equivalent
to

the

now
waddled
in
with
a
summons
from
the
ladies
to
tea
and
coffee
the
squire
was
unwilling
to
leave
his
burgundy
mr
escot
strenuously
urged
the
necessity
of
immediate
adjournment
observing
that
the
longer
they
continued
drinking
the
worse
they
should
be
mr
foster
seconded
the
motion
declaring
the
transition
from
the
bottle
to
female
society
to
be
an
indisputable
amelioration
of
the
state
of
the
sensitive
man
mr
jenkison
allowed
the
squire
and
his
two
brother
philosophers
to
settle
the
point
between
them
concluding
that
he
was
just
as
well
in
one
place
as
another
the
question
of
adjournment
was
then
put
and
carried
by
a
large
majority
chapter
vi
the
evening
mr
panscope
highly
irritated
by
the
cool
contempt
with
which
mr
escot
had
treated
him
sate
sipping
his
coffee
and
meditating
revenge
he
was
not
long
in
discovering
the
passion
of
his
antagonist
for
the
beautiful
cephalis
for
whom
he
had
himself
a
species
of
predilection
and
it
was
also
obvious
to
him
that
there
was
some
lurking
anger
in
the
mind
of
her
father
unfavourable
to
the
hopes
of
his
rival
the
stimulus
of
revenge
superadded
to
that
of
preconceived
inclination
determined
him
after
due
deliberation
to
mr
escot
in
the
young
lady
favour
the
practicability
of
this
design
he
did
not
trouble
himself
to
investigate
for
the
havoc
he
had
made
in
the
hearts
of
some
silly
girls
who
were
extremely
vulnerable
to
flattery
and
who
not
understanding
a
word
he
said
considered
him
a
clever
had
impressed
him
with
an
unhesitating
idea
of
his
own
irresistibility
he
had
not
only
the
requisites
already
specified
for
fascinating
female
vanity
he
could
likewise
fiddle
with
tolerable
dexterity
though
by
no
means
so
as
mr
chromatic
for
our
readers
are
of
course
aware
that
rapidity
of
execution
not
delicacy
of
expression
constitutes
the
scientific
perfection
of
modern
music
and
could
warble
a
fashionable
with
considerable
affectation
of
feeling
besides
this
he
was
always
extremely
well
dressed
and
was
to
an
estate
of
ten
thousand
the
influence
which
the
latter
consideration
might
have
on
the
minds
of
the
majority
of
his
female
acquaintance
whose
morals
had
been
formed
by
the
novels
of
such
writers
as
miss
philomela
poppyseed
did
not
once
enter
into
his
calculation
of
his
own
personal
attractions
relying
therefore
on
past
success
he
determined
appeal
to
his
and
already
in
imagination
considered
himself
sole
lord
and
master
of
the
affections
of
the
beautiful
cephalis
mr
escot
and
mr
foster
were
the
only
two
of
the
party
who
had
entered
the
library
to
which
the
ladies
had
retired
and
which
was
interior
to
the
in
a
state
of
perfect
sobriety
mr
escot
had
placed
himself
next
to
the
beautiful
cephalis
mr
cranium
had
laid
aside
much
of
the
terror
of
his
frown
the
short
craniological
conversation
which
had
passed
between
him
and
mr
escot
had
softened
his
heart
in
his
favour
and
the
copious
libations
of
burgundy
in
which
he
had
indulged
had
smoothed
his
brow
into
unusual
serenity
mr
foster
placed
himself
near
the
lovely
caprioletta
whose
artless
and
innocent
conversation
had
already
made
an
impression
on
his
susceptible
spirit
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
seated
himself
in
the
corner
of
a
sofa
near
miss
philomela
poppyseed
miss
philomela
detailed
to
him
the
plan
of
a
very
moral
and
aristocratical
novel
she
was
preparing
for
the
press
and
continued
holding
forth
with
her
eyes
half
shut
till
a
nasal
tone
from
the
reverend
divine
compelled
her
suddenly
to
open
them
in
all
the
indignation
of
surprise
the
cessation
of
the
hum
of
her
voice
awakened
the
reverend
gentleman
who
lifting
up
first
one
eyelid
then
the
other
articulated
or
rather
murmured
admirably
planned
indeed
i
have
not
quite
finished
sir
said
miss
philomela
bridling
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
inform
me
where
i
left
off
the
doctor
hummed
a
while
and
at
length
answered
i
think
you
had
just
laid
it
down
as
a
position
that
a
thousand
is
an
indispensable
ingredient
in
the
passion
of
love
and
that
no
man
who
is
not
so
far
gifted
by
can
reasonably
presume
to
feel
that
passion
himself
or
be
correctly
the
object
of
it
with
a
female
that
sir
said
miss
philomela
highly
incensed
is
the
fundamental
principle
which
i
lay
down
in
the
first
chapter
and
which
the
whole
four
volumes
of
which
i
detailed
to
you
the
outline
are
intended
to
set
in
a
strong
practical
light
bless
me
said
the
doctor
what
a
nap
i
must
have
had
miss
philomela
flung
away
to
the
side
of
her
dear
friends
gall
and
treacle
under
whose
fostering
patronage
she
had
been
puffed
into
an
extensive
reputation
much
to
the
advantage
of
the
young
ladies
of
the
age
whom
she
taught
to
consider
themselves
as
a
sort
of
commodity
to
be
put
up
at
public
auction
and
knocked
down
to
the
highest
bidder
mr
nightshade
and
mr
mac
laurel
joined
the
trio
and
it
was
secretly
resolved
that
miss
philomela
should
furnish
them
with
a
portion
of
her
manuscripts
and
that
messieurs
gall
should
devote
the
following
morning
to
cutting
and
drying
a
critique
on
a
work
calculated
to
prove
so
extensively
beneficial
that
mr
gall
protested
he
really
the
writer
while
this
amiable
and
enlightened
quintetto
were
busily
employed
in
flattering
one
another
mr
cranium
retired
to
complete
the
preparations
he
had
begun
in
the
morning
for
a
lecture
with
which
he
intended
on
some
future
evening
to
favour
the
company

patrick
walked
out
into
the
grounds
to
study
the
effect
of
moonlight
on
the
mountains
mr
foster
and
mr
escot
continued
to
make
love
and
mr
panscope
to
digest
his
plan
of
attack

the
heart
of

by

reading

humming

here
is
a

rock
with
the
rooted
in
its

overgrown
as
you
see
with
ivy
and

and
from
this
part
of
it
bursts
a
little

runs
bubbling
down
its

such
a

now
observe
the
metamorphosis
here
is
the
same
rock
cut
into
the
shape
of
a
giant
in
one
hand
he
holds
a
horn
through
which
that
little
fountain
is
thrown
to
a
prodigious
elevation
in
the
other
is
a
ponderous
stone
so
exactly
balanced
as
to
be
apparently
ready
to
fall
on
the

of
any
person
who
may

to

there
is
lord

walking
under

this
is
the
summit
of
a
hill
covered
as
you
perceive
with
wood
and
with
those
mossy
stones
scattered
at
random
under
the
trees
what
a
delightful
spot
to
read
in
on
a
summer
day
the
air
must
be
so
pure
and
the

must
sound

bad

i
assure
you
here
is

the

are
cut
down
the

are
cleared

this
is
an
octagonal
pavilion
exactly
on
the
centre
of
the
summit
and
there
you
see
lord

on
the

of
the

enjoying
the

glorious

here
is
a

leading
through
impervious

the
ass
and
the
four

characterise
a
wild
uncultured
scene
here
as
you
perceive
it
is
totally
changed
into
a
beautiful
gracefully
curving
through
a
belt
of

there
is

here

a

half
bosomed
in

near
the

of

an

peeping
from

and
devilish
wise
he
looks
here
is
the

without

near
it
standing
in
the

of
an
undulating

a

reflected
to

in

during
this
conversation
a
hot
dispute
had
arisen
between
messieurs
gall
and
nightshade
the
latter
pertinaciously
insisting
on
having
his
new
poem
reviewed
by
treacle
who
he
knew
would
extol
it
most
loftily
and
not
by
gall
whose
sarcastic
commendation
he
held
in
superlative
horror
the
remonstrances
of
squire
headlong
silenced
the
disputants
but
did
not
mollify
the
inflexible
gall
nor
appease
the
irritated
nightshade
who
secretly
resolved
that
on
his
return
to
london
he
would
beat
his
drum
in
grub
street
form
a
mastigophoric
corps
of
his
own
and
hoist
the
standard
of
determined
opposition
against
this
critical

entered
and
after
some
rapturous
exclamations
on

of
the
entreated
that
one
of
the
young
ladies
would
favour
him
with
a
song
miss
tenorina
and
miss
graziosa
now
enchanted
the
company
with
some
very
scientific
compositions
which
as
usual
excited
admiration
and
astonishment
in
every
one
without
a
single
particle
of
genuine
pleasure
the
beautiful
cephalis
being
then
summoned
to
take
her
station
at
the
harp
sang
with
feeling
and
simplicity
the
following
air

oh
who

replied
swifter

streams
through

and
who
art

his
flight
pursuing
is
cold
neglect
whom
now
you
see
the
little

you
there
are
viewing
will
die
if
once
he
touched
by
me
oh

the
little
butler
now
appeared
with
a
summons
to
supper
shortly
after
which
the
party
dispersed
for
the
night
chapter
vii
the
walk
it
was
an
old
custom
in
headlong
hall
to
have
breakfast
ready
at
eight
and
continue
it
till
two
that
the
various
guests
might
rise
at
their
own
hour
breakfast
when
they
came
down
and
employ
the
morning
as
they
thought
proper
the
squire
only
expecting
that
they
should
punctually
assemble
at
dinner
during
the
whole
of
this
period
the
little
butler
stood
sentinel
at
a
near
the
fire
copiously
furnished
with
all
the
apparatus
of
tea
coffee
chocolate
milk
cream
eggs
rolls
toast
muffins
bread
butter
potted
beef
cold
fowl
and
partridge
ham
tongue
and
anchovy
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
found
himself
rather
in
the
morning
therefore
preferred
breakfasting
in
bed
on
a
mug
of
buttered
ale
and
an
anchovy
toast
the
three
philosophers
made
their
appearance
at
eight
and
enjoyed
premices
des
mr
foster
proposed
that
as
it
was
a
fine
frosty
morning
and
they
were
all
good
pedestrians
they
should
take
a
walk
to
tremadoc
to
see
the
improvements
carrying
on
in
that
vicinity
this
being
readily
acceded
to
they
began
their
walk
after
their
departure
appeared
squire
headlong
and
mr
milestone
who
agreed
over
their
muffin
and
partridge
to
walk
together
to
a
ruined
tower
within
the
precincts
of
the
squire
grounds
which
mr
milestone
thought
he
could
improve
the
other
guests
dropped
in
by
ones
and
twos
and
made
their
respective
arrangements
for
the
morning
mr
panscope
took
a
little
ramble
with
mr
cranium
in
the
course
of
which
the
former
professed
a
great
enthusiasm
for
the
science
of
craniology
and
a
great
deal
of
love
for
the
beautiful
cephalis
adding
a
few
words
about
his
expectations
the
old
gentleman
was
unable
to
withstand
this
triple
battery
and
it
was
accordingly
determined
after
the
manner
of
the
heroic
age
in
which
it
was
deemed
superfluous
to
consult
the
opinions
and
feelings
of
the
lady
as
to
the
manner
in
which
she
should
be
disposed
of
that
the
lovely
miss
cranium
should
be
made
the
happy
bride
of
the
accomplished
mr
panscope
we
shall
leave
them
for
the
present
to
settle
preliminaries
while
we
accompany
the
three
philosophers
in
their
walk
to
tremadoc
the
vale
contracted
as
they
advanced
and
when
they
had
passed
the
termination
of
the
lake
their
road
wound
along
a
narrow
and
romantic
pass
through
the
middle
of
which
an
impetuous
torrent
dashed
over
vast
fragments
of
stone
the
pass
was
bordered
on
both
sides
by
perpendicular
rocks
broken
into
the
wildest
forms
of
fantastic
magnificence
these
are
indeed
said
mr
escot
mundi
yet
they
must
be
feeble
images
of
the
valleys
of
the
andes
where
the
philosophic
eye
may
contemplate
in
their
utmost
extent
the
effects
of
that
tremendous
convulsion
which
destroyed
the
perpendicularity
of
the
poles
and
inundated
this
globe
with
that
torrent
of
physical
evil
from
which
the
greater
torrent
of
moral
evil
has
issued
that
will
continue
to
roll
on
with
an
expansive
power
and
an
accelerated
impetus
till
the
whole
human
race
shall
be
swept
away
in
its
vortex
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
said
mr
foster
will
gradually
ameliorate
the
physical
state
of
our
planet
till
the
ecliptic
shall
again
coincide
with
the
equator
and
the
equal
diffusion
of
light
and
heat
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
earth
typify
the
equal
and
happy
existence
of
man
who
will
then
have
attained
the
final
step
of
pure
and
perfect
intelligence
it
is
by
no
means
clear
said
mr
jenkison
that
the
axis
of
the
earth
was
ever
perpendicular
to
the
plane
of
its
orbit
or
that
it
ever
will
be
so
explosion
and
convulsion
are
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
either
hypothesis
for
la
place
has
demonstrated
that
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
is
only
a
secular
equation
of
a
very
long
period
which
of
course
proves
nothing
either
on
one
side
or
the
other
they
now
emerged
by
a
winding
ascent
from
the
vale
of
llanberris
and
after
some
little
time
arrived
at
bedd
gelert
proceeding
through
the
sublimely
romantic
pass
of
aberglaslynn
their
road
led
along
the
edge
of
traeth
mawr
a
vast
arm
of
the
sea
which
they
then
beheld
in
all
the
magnificence
of
the
flowing
tide
another
five
miles
brought
them
to
the
embankment
which
has
since
been
completed
and
which
by
connecting
the
two
counties
of
meirionnydd
and
caernarvon
excludes
the
sea
from
an
extensive
tract
the
embankment
which
was
carried
on
at
the
same
time
from
both
the
opposite
coasts
was
then
very
nearly
meeting
in
the
centre
they
walked
to
the
extremity
of
that
part
of
it
which
was
thrown
out
from
the
caernarvonshire
shore
the
tide
was
now
ebbing
it
had
filled
the
vast
basin
within
forming
a
lake
about
five
miles
in
length
and
more
than
one
in
breadth
as
they
looked
upwards
with
their
backs
to
the
open
sea
they
beheld
a
scene
which
no
other
in
this
country
can
parallel
and
which
the
admirers
of
the
magnificence
of
nature
will
ever
remember
with
regret
whatever
consolation
may
be
derived
from
the
probable
utility
of
the
works
which
have
excluded
the
waters
from
their
ancient
receptacle
vast
rocks
and
precipices
intersected
with
little
torrents
formed
the
barrier
on
the
left
on
the
right
the
triple
summit
of
moelwyn
reared
its
majestic
boundary
in
the
depth
was
that
sea
of
mountains
the
wild
and
stormy
outline
of
the
snowdonian
chain
with
the
giant
wyddfa
towering
in
the
midst
the
remains
unchanged
unchangeable
but
the
liquid
mirror
it
enclosed
is
gone
the
tide
ebbed
with
rapidity
the
waters
within
retained
by
the
embankment
poured
through
its
two
points
an
impetuous
cataract
curling
and
boiling
in
innumerable
eddies
and
making
a
tumultuous
melody
admirably
in
unison
with
the
surrounding
scene
the
three
philosophers
looked
on
in
silence
and
at
length
unwillingly
turned
away
and
proceeded
to
the
little
town
of
tremadoc
which
is
built
on
land
recovered
in
a
similar
manner
from
the
sea
after
inspecting
the
manufactories
and
refreshing
themselves
at
the
inn
on
a
cold
saddle
of
mutton
and
a
bottle
of
sherry
they
retraced
their
steps
towards
headlong
hall
commenting
as
they
went
on
the
various
objects
they
had
seen
i
regret
that
time
did
not
allow
us
to
see
the
caves
on
the
there
is
one
of
which
the
depth
is
said
to
be
unknown
there
is
a
tradition
in
the
country
that
an
adventurous
fiddler
once
resolved
to
explore
it
that
he
entered
and
never
returned
but
that
the
subterranean
sound
of
a
fiddle
was
heard
at
a
seven
miles
inland
it
is
therefore
concluded
that
he
lost
his
way
in
the
labyrinth
of
caverns
supposed
to
exist
under
the
rocky
soil
of
this
part
of
the
country
a
supposition
that
must
always
remain
in
force
unless
a
second
fiddler
equally
adventurous
and
more
successful
should
return
with
an
accurate
report
of
the
true
state
of
the
fact
what
think
you
of
the
little
colony
we
have
just
been
inspecting
a
city
as
it
were
in
its
cradle
with
all
the
weakness
of
infancy
and
all
the
vices
of
maturer
age
i
confess
the
sight
of
those
manufactories
which
have
suddenly
sprung
up
like
fungous
excrescences
in
the
bosom
of
these
wild
and
desolate
scenes
impressed
me
with
as
much
horror
and
amazement
as
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
stocking
manufactory
struck
into
the
mind
of
rousseau
when
in
a
lonely
valley
of
the
alps
he
had
just
congratulated
himself
on
finding
a
spot
where
man
had
never
been
the
manufacturing
system
is
not
yet
purified
from
some
evils
which
necessarily
attend
it
but
which
i
conceive
are
greatly
overbalanced
by
their
concomitant
advantages
contemplate
the
vast
sum
of
human
industry
to
which
this
system
so
essentially
contributes

in

at
that
hour
of

their

as
mr
escot
said
this
a
little
girl
with
a
basket
of
heath
on
her
head
came
tripping
down
the
side
of
one
of
the
rocks
on
the
left
the
force
of
contrast
struck
even
on
the
phlegmatic
spirit
of
mr
jenkison
and
he
almost
inclined
for
a
moment
to
the
doctrine
of
deterioration
mr
escot
continued
nor
is
the
lot
of
the
parents
more
enviable
sedentary
victims
of
unhealthy
toil
they
have
neither
the
corporeal
energy
of
the
savage
nor
the
mental
acquisitions
of
the
civilised
man
mind
indeed
they
have
none
and
scarcely
animal
life
they
are
mere
automata
component
parts
of
the
enormous
machines
which
administer
to
the
pampered
appetites
of
the
few
who
consider
themselves
the
most
valuable
portion
of
a
state
because
they
consume
in
indolence
the
fruits
of
the
earth
and
contribute
nothing
to
the
benefit
of
the
community
that
these
are
evils
can
not
be
denied
but
they
have
their
counterbalancing
advantages
that
a
man
should
pass
the
day
in
a
furnace
and
the
night
in
a
cellar
is
bad
for
the
individual
but
good
for
others
who
enjoy
the
benefit
of
his
labour
by
what
right
do
they
so
by
the
right
of
all
property
and
all
possession
droit
du
plus
do
you
justify
that
principle
i
neither
justify
nor
condemn
it
it
is
practically
recognised
in
all
societies
and
though
it
is
certainly
the
source
of
enormous
evil
i
conceive
it
is
also
the
source
of
abundant
good
or
it
would
not
have
so
many
supporters
that
is
by
no
means
a
consequence
do
we
not
every
day
see
men
supporting
the
most
enormous
evils
which
they
know
to
be
so
with
respect
to
others
and
which
in
reality
are
so
with

to
themselves

that
in

will
be

to
something
like

conclusion
i
doubt
it
much
i
conceive
if

we

were

of

we
should
never

it

must
at

assent
to
the
following
positions
that

the
few
that
in

are
occupied
in

perpetual
struggle
for
the
preservation
of
a
perilous
and
precarious
existence
while
the
remaining

wallows
in
all
the
redundancies
of
luxury
that
can
be
wrung
from
their
labours
and
privations
that
luxury
and
liberty
are
incompatible
and
that
every

you
invent
for

is
a
new
instrument

they
had
now
regained
the
shores
of
the
lake
when
the
conversation
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
tremendous
explosion
followed
by
a
violent
splashing
of
water
and
various
sounds
of
tumult
and
confusion
which
induced
them
to
quicken
their
pace
towards
the
spot
whence
they
proceeded
chapter
viii
the
tower
in
all
the
thoughts
words
and
actions
of
squire
headlong
there
was
a
remarkable
alacrity
of
progression
which
almost
annihilated
the
interval
between
conception
and
execution
he
was
utterly
regardless
of
obstacles
and
seemed
to
have
expunged
their
very
name
from
his
vocabulary
his
designs
were
never
nipped
in
their
infancy
by
the
contemplation
of
those
trivial
difficulties
which
often
turn
awry
the
current
of
enterprise
and
though
the
rapidity
of
his
movements
was
sometimes
arrested
by
a
more
formidable
barrier
either
naturally
existing
in
the
pursuit
he
had
undertaken
or
created
by
his
own
impetuosity
he
seldom
failed
to
succeed
either
in
knocking
it
down
or
cutting
his
way
through
it
he
had
little
idea
of
gradation
he
saw
no
interval
between
the
first
step
and
the
last
but
pounced
upon
his
object
with
the
impetus
of
a
mountain
cataract
this
rapidity
of
movement
indeed
subjected
him
to
some
disasters
which
cooler
spirits
would
have
escaped
he
was
an
excellent
sportsman
and
almost
always
killed
his
game
but
now
and
then
he
killed
his
dog
rocks
streams
hedges
gates
and
ditches
were
objects
of
no
account
in
his
estimation
though
a
dislocated
shoulder
several
severe
bruises
and
two
or
three
narrow
escapes
for
his
neck
might
have
been
expected
to
teach
him
a
certain
degree
of
caution
in
effecting
his
transitions
he
was
so
singularly
alert
in
climbing
precipices
and
traversing
torrents
that
when
he
went
out
on
a
shooting
party
he
was
very
soon
left
to
continue
his
sport
alone
for
he
was
sure
to
dash
up
or
down
some
nearly
perpendicular
path
where
no
one
else
had
either
ability
or
inclination
to
follow
he
had
a
pleasure
boat
on
the
lake
which
he
steered
with
amazing
dexterity
but
as
he
always
indulged
himself
in
the
utmost
possible
latitude
of
sail
he
was
occasionally
upset
by
a
sudden
gust
and
was
indebted
to
his
skill
in
the
art
of
swimming
for
the
opportunity
of
tempering
with
a
copious
libation
of
wine
the
unnatural
frigidity
introduced
into
his
stomach
by
the
extraordinary
intrusion
of
water
an
element
which
he
had
religiously
determined
should
never
pass
his
lips
but
of
which
on
these
occasions
he
was
sometimes
compelled
to
swallow
no
inconsiderable
quantity
this
circumstance
alone
of
the
various
disasters
that
befell
him
occasioned
him
any
permanent
affliction
and
he
accordingly
noted
the
day
in
his
as
a
with
this
simple
abstract
and
brief
chronicle
of
the
calamity
swallowed
two
or
three
pints
of
without
any
notice
whatever
of
the
concomitant
circumstances
these
days
of
which
there
were
several
were
set
apart
in
headlong
hall
for
the
purpose
of
anniversary
expiation
and
as
often
as
the
day
returned
on
which
the
squire
had
swallowed
water
he
not
only
made
a
point
of
swallowing
a
treble
allowance
of
wine
himself
but
imposed
a
heavy
mulct
on
every
one
of
his
servants
who
should
be
detected
in
a
state
of
sobriety
after
sunset
but
their
conduct
on
these
occasions
was
so
uniformly
exemplary
that
no
instance
of
the
infliction
of
the
penalty
appears
on
record
the
squire
and
mr
milestone
as
we
have
already
said
had
set
out
immediately
after
breakfast
to
examine
the
capabilities
of
the
scenery
the
object
that
most
attracted
mr
milestone
admiration
was
a
ruined
tower
on
a
projecting
point
of
rock
almost
totally
overgrown
with
ivy
this
ivy
mr
milestone
observed
required
trimming
and
clearing
in
various
parts
a
little
pointing
and
polishing
was
also
necessary
for
the
dilapidated
walls
and
the
whole
effect
would
be
materially
increased
by
a
plantation
of
spruce
fir
interspersed
with
cypress
and
juniper
the
present
rugged
and
broken
ascent
from
the
land
side
being
first
converted
into
a
beautiful
slope
which
might
be
easily
effected
by
blowing
up
a
part
of
the
rock
with
gunpowder
laying
on
a
quantity
of
fine
mould
and
covering
the
whole
with
an
elegant
stratum
of
turf
squire
headlong
caught
with
avidity
at
this
suggestion
and
as
he
had
always
a
store
of
gunpowder
in
the
house
for
the
accommodation
of
himself
and
his
shooting
visitors
and
for
the
supply
of
a
small
battery
of
cannon
which
he
kept
for
his
private
amusement
he
insisted
on
commencing
operations
immediately
accordingly
he
bounded
back
to
the
house
and
very
speedily
returned
accompanied
by
the
little
butler
and
half
a
dozen
servants
and
labourers
with
pickaxes
and
gunpowder
a
hanging
stove
and
a
poker
together
with
a
basket
of
cold
meat
and
two
or
three
bottles
of
madeira
for
the
squire
thought
with
many
others
that
a
copious
supply
of
provision
is
a
very
necessary
ingredient
in
all
rural
amusements
mr
milestone
superintended
the
proceedings
the
rock
was
excavated
the
powder
introduced
the
apertures
strongly
blockaded
with
fragments
of
stone
a
long
train
was
laid
to
a
spot
which
mr
milestone
fixed
on
as
sufficiently
remote
from
the
possibility
of
harm
the
squire
seized
the
poker
and
after
flourishing
it
in
the
air
with
a
degree
of
dexterity
which
induced
the
rest
of
the
party
to
leave
him
in
solitary
possession
of
an
extensive
circumference
applied
the
end
of
it
to
the
train
and
the
rapidly
communicated
ignition
ran
hissing
along
the
surface
of
the
soil
at
this
critical
moment
mr
cranium
and
mr
panscope
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
tower
which
unseeing
and
unseen
they
had
ascended
on
the
opposite
side
to
that
where
the
squire
and
mr
milestone
were
conducting
their
operations
their
sudden
appearance
a
little
dismayed
the
squire
who
however
comforted
himself
with
the
reflection
that
the
tower
was
perfectly
safe
or
at
least
was
intended
to
be
so
and
that
his
friends
were
in
no
probable
danger
but
of
a
knock
on
the
head
from
a
flying
fragment
of
stone
the
succession
of
these
thoughts
in
the
mind
of
the
squire
was
commensurate
in
rapidity
to
the
progress
of
the
ignition
which
having
reached
its
extremity
the
explosion
took
place
and
the
shattered
rock
was
hurled
into
the
air
in
the
midst
of
fire
and
smoke
mr
milestone
had
properly
calculated
the
force
of
the
explosion
for
the
tower
remained
untouched
but
the
squire
in
his
consolatory
reflections
had
omitted
the
consideration
of
the
influence
of
sudden
fear
which
had
so
violent
an
effect
on
mr
cranium
who
was
just
commencing
a
speech
concerning
the
very
fine
prospect
from
the
top
of
the
tower
that
cutting
short
the
thread
of
his
observations
he
bounded
under
the
elastic
influence
of
terror
several
feet
into
the
air
his
ascent
being
unluckily
a
little
out
of
the
perpendicular
he
descended
with
a
proportionate
curve
from
the
apex
of
his
projection
and
alighted
not
on
the
wall
of
the
tower
but
in
an
by
its
side
which
giving
way
beneath
him
transferred
him
to
a
tuft
of
hazel
at
its
base
which
after
upholding
him
an
instant
consigned
him
to
the
boughs
of
an
ash
that
had
rooted
itself
in
a
fissure
about
half
way
down
the
rock
which
finally
transmitted
him
to
the
waters
below
squire
headlong
anxiously
watched
the
tower
as
the
smoke
which
at
first
enveloped
it
rolled
away
but
when
this
shadowy
curtain
was
withdrawn
and
mr
panscope
was
discovered
in
a
tragical
attitude
his
apprehensions
became
boundless
and
he
concluded
that
the
unlucky
collision
of
a
flying
fragment
of
rock
had
indeed
emancipated
the
spirit
of
the
craniologist
from
its
terrestrial
bondage
mr
escot
had
considerably
outstripped
his
companions
and
arrived
at
the
scene
of
the
disaster
just
as
mr
cranium
being
utterly
destitute
of
natatorial
skill
was
in
imminent
danger
of
final
submersion
the
deteriorationist
who
had
cultivated
this
valuable
art
with
great
success
immediately
plunged
in
to
his
assistance
and
brought
him
alive
and
in
safety
to
a
shelving
part
of
the
shore
their
landing
was
hailed
with
a
from
the
delighted
squire
who
shaking
them
both
heartily
by
the
hand
and
making
ten
thousand
lame
apologies
to
mr
cranium
concluded
by
asking
in
a
pathetic
tone
much
water
he
had
swallowed
and
without
waiting
for
his
answer
filled
a
large
tumbler
with
madeira
and
insisted
on
his
tossing
it
off
which
was
no
sooner
said
than
done
mr
jenkison
and
mr
foster
now
made
their
appearance
mr
panscope
descended
the
tower
which
he
vowed
never
again
to
approach
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
tumbler
of
madeira
was
replenished
and
handed
round
to
recruit
the
spirits
of
the
party
which
now
began
to
move
towards
headlong
hall
the
squire
capering
for
joy
in
the
van
and
the
little
fat
butler
waddling
in
the
rear
the
squire
took
care
that
mr
cranium
should
be
seated
next
to
him
at
dinner
and
plied
him
so
hard
with
madeira
to
prevent
him
as
he
said
from
taking
cold
that
long
before
the
ladies
sent
in
their
summons
to
coffee
every
organ
in
his
brain
was
in
a
complete
state
of
revolution
and
the
squire
was
under
the
necessity
of
ringing
for
three
or
four
servants
to
carry
him
to
bed
observing
with
a
smile
of
great
satisfaction
that
he
was
in
a
very
excellent
way
for
escaping
any
ill
consequences
that
might
have
resulted
from
his
accident
the
beautiful
cephalis
being
thus
freed
from
his
was
enabled
during
the
course
of
the
evening
to
develop
to
his
preserver
the
full
extent
of
her
gratitude
chapter
ix
the
sexton
mr
escot
passed
a
sleepless
night
the
ordinary
effect
of
love
according
to
some
amatory
poets
who
seem
to
have
composed
their
whining
ditties
for
the
benevolent
purpose
of
bestowing
on
others
that
gentle
slumber
of
which
they
so
pathetically
lament
the
privation
the
deteriorationist
entered
into
a
profound
moral
soliloquy
in
which
he
first
examined
a
philosopher
ought
to
be
in
love
having
decided
this
point
affirmatively
against
plato
and
lucretius
he
next
examined
that
passion
ought
to
have
the
effect
of
keeping
a
philosopher
awake
having
decided
this
negatively
he
resolved
to
go
to
sleep
immediately
not
being
able
to
accomplish
this
to
his
satisfaction
he
tossed
and
tumbled
like
achilles
or
orlando
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
repeated
to
himself
several
hundred
lines
of
poetry
counted
a
thousand
began
again
and
counted
another
thousand
in
vain
the
beautiful
cephalis
was
the
predominant
image
in
all
his
soliloquies
in
all
his
repetitions
even
in
the
numerical
process
from
which
he
sought
relief
he
did
but
associate
the
idea
of
number
with
that
of
his
dear
tormentor
till
she
appeared
to
his
mind
eye
in
a
thousand
similitudes
distinct
not
different
these
thousand
images
indeed
were
but
one
and
yet
the
one
was
a
thousand
a
sort
of
phantasma
which
will
be
very
intelligible
to
some
understandings
he
arose
with
the
first
peep
of
day
and
sallied
forth
to
enjoy
the
balmy
breeze
of
morning
which
any
but
a
lover
might
have
thought
too
cool
for
it
was
an
intense
frost
the
sun
had
not
risen
and
the
wind
was
rather
fresh
from
and
by
north
but
a
lover
who
like
ladurlad
in
the
curse
of
kehama
always
has
or
at
least
is
supposed
to
have
a
fire
in
his
heart
and
a
fire
in
his
brain
feels
a
wintry
breeze
from
and
by
steal
over
his
cheek
like
the
south
over
a
bank
of
violets
therefore
on
walked
the
philosopher
with
his
coat
unbuttoned
and
his
hat
in
his
hand
careless
of
whither
he
went
till
he
found
himself
near
the
enclosure
of
a
little
mountain
chapel
passing
through
the
wicket
and
stepping
over
two
or
three
graves
he
stood
on
a
rustic
tombstone
and
peeped
through
the
chapel
window
examining
the
interior
with
as
much
curiosity
as
if
he
had
forgotten
what
the
inside
of
a
church
was
made
of
which
it
is
rather
to
be
feared
was
the
case
before
him
and
beneath
him
were
the
font
the
altar
and
the
grave
which
gave
rise
to
a
train
of
moral
reflections
on
the
three
great
epochs
in
the
course
of
the
birth
marriage
and
death
the
middle
stage
of
the
process
arrested
his
attention
and
his
imagination
placed
before
him
several
figures
which
he
thought
with
the
addition
of
his
own
would
make
a
very
picturesque
group
the
beautiful
cephalis
arrayed
in
her
bridal
apparel
of
white
her
friend
caprioletta
officiating
as
bridemaid
mr
cranium
giving
her
away
and
last
not
least
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
intoning
the
marriage
ceremony
with
the
regular
orthodox
allowance
of
nasal
recitative
whilst
he
was
feasting
his
eyes
on
this
imaginary
picture
the
demon
of
mistrust
insinuated
himself
into
the
storehouse
of
his
conceptions
and
removing
his
figure
from
the
group
substituted
that
of
mr
panscope
which
gave
such
a
violent
shock
to
his
feelings
that
he
suddenly
exclaimed
with
an
extraordinary
elevation
of
voice
kakodaimon
kai
tris
kakodaimon
kai
tetrakis
kai
pentakis
kai
dodekakis
kai
muriakis
to
the
great
terror
of
the
sexton
who
was
just
entering
the
churchyard
and
not
knowing
from
whence
the
voice
proceeded
que

the
sight
of
the
philosopher
dispelled
his
apprehensions
when
growing
suddenly

immediately
addressed

and
the

at

tistance
to

just
now
pefore
i

that
the

was
the

calling

pless
us
to
pe
sure
she
should
have
been
puried
in
the
middle
of
the
river
where
the
tevil
ca
come
as
your
honour
fery
well
knows
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
it
said
mr
escot
true
true
continued
the
sexton
put
to
pe
sure
owen
thomas
of
will
have
it
that
one
summer
evening
when
he
went
over
to
cwm
cynfael
in
meirionnydd
apout
some
cattles
he
wanted
to
puy
he
saw
a
strange
figure
pless
us
with
five
horns
cot
save
us
sitting
on
hugh
llwyd
pulpit
which
your
honour
fery
well
knows
is
a
pig
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
river
of
course
he
was
mistaken
said
mr
escot
to
pe
sure
he
was
said
the
sexton
for
there
is
no
toubt
put
the
tevil
when
owen
thomas
saw
him
must
have
peen
sitting
on
a
piece
of
rock
in
a
straight
line
from
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
where
he
used
to
sit
look
you
for
a
whole
summer
tay
while
hugh
llwyd
was
on
his
pulpit
and
there
they
used
to
talk
across
the
water
for
hugh
llwyd
please
your
honour
never
raised
the
tevil
except
when
he
was
safe
in
the
middle
of
the
river
which
proves
that
owen
thomas
in
his
fright
did
pay
proper
attention
to
the
exact
spot
where
the
tevil
was
the
sexton
concluded
his
speech
with
an
approving
smile
at
his
own
sagacity
in
so
luminously
expounding
the
nature
of
owen
mistake
i
perceive
said
mr
escot
you
have
a
very
deep
insight
into
things
and
can
therefore
perhaps
facilitate
the
resolution
of
a
question
concerning
which
though
i
have
little
doubt
on
the
subject
i
am
desirous
of
obtaining
the
most
extensive
and
accurate
information
the
sexton
scratched
his
head
the
language
of
mr
escot
not
being
to
his
apprehension
quite
so
luminous
as
his
own
you
have
been
sexton
here
continued
mr
escot
in
the
language
of
hamlet
man
and
boy
forty
years
the
sexton
turned
pale
the
period
mr
escot
named
was
so
nearly
the
true
one
that
he
began
to
suspect
the
personage
before
him
of
being
rather
too
familiar
with
hugh
llwyd
sable
visitor
recovering
himself
a
little
he
said
why
thereapouts
sure
enough
during
this
period
you
have
of
course
dug
up
many
bones
of
the
people
of
ancient
times
pones
cot
pless
you
yes
pones
as
old
as
the
perhaps
you
can
show
me
a
few
the
sexton
grinned
horribly
a
ghastly
smile
will
you
take
your
pible
oath
you
to
want
them
to
raise
the
tevil
with
willingly
said
mr
escot
smiling
i
have
an
abstruse
reason
for
the
inquiry
why
if
you
have
an
reason
said
the
sexton
who
thought
this
a
good
opportunity
to
show
that
he
could
pronounce
hard
words
as
well
as
other
people
if
you
have
an
reason
that
alters
the
case
so
saying
he
led
the
way
to
the
from
which
he
began
to
throw
out
various
bones
and
skulls
of
more
than
common
dimensions
and
amongst
them
a
skull
of
very
extraordinary
magnitude
which
he
swore
by
st
david
was
the
skull
of
cadwallader
how
do
you
know
this
to
be
his
skull
said
mr
escot
he
was
the
piggest
man
that
ever
lived
and
he
was
puried
here
and
this
is
the
piggest
skull
i
ever
found
you
see
now
nothing
can
be
more
logical
said
mr
escot
my
good
friend
will
you
allow
me
to
take
this
skull
away
with
me
st
winifred
pless
us
exclaimed
the
sexton
would
you
have
me
haunted
py
his
chost
for
taking
his
plessed
pones
out
of
consecrated
cround
would
you
have
him
come
in
the
tead
of
the
night
and
fly
away
with
the
roof
of
my
house
would
you
have
all
the
crop
of
my
carden
come
to
nothing
for
look
you
his
epitaph
says
he
that
my
pones
shall
ill
pestow
leek
in
his
cround
shall
never
crow
you
will
ill
bestow
them
said
mr
escot
in
confounding
them
with
those
of
the
sons
of
little
men
the
degenerate
dwarfs
of
later
generations
you
will
well
bestow
them
in
giving
them
to
me
for
i
will
have
this
illustrious
skull
bound
with
a
silver
rim
and
filled
with
mantling
wine
with
this
inscription
nunc
tandem
signifying
that
that
pernicious
liquor
has
at
length
found
its
proper
receptacle
for
when
the
wine
is
in
the
brain
is
out
saying
these
words
he
put
a
dollar
into
the
hands
of
the
sexton
who
instantly
stood
spellbound
by
the
talismanic
influence
of
the
coin
while
mr
escot
walked
off
in
triumph
with
the
skull
of
cadwallader
chapter
x
the
skull
when
mr
escot
entered
the
he
found
the
majority
of
the
party
assembled
and
the
little
butler
very
active
at
his
station
several
of
the
ladies
shrieked
at
the
sight
of
the
skull
and
miss
tenorina
starting
up
in
great
haste
and
terror
caused
the
subversion
of
a
cup
of
chocolate
which
a
servant
was
handing
to
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
into
the
nape
of
the
neck
of
sir
patrick
sir
patrick
rising
impetuously
clap
an
as
he
expressed
himself
the
farthing
rushlight
of
the
rascal
pushed
over
the
chair
of
marmaduke
milestone
esquire
who
catching
for
support
at
the
first
thing
that
came
in
his
way
which
happened
unluckily
to
be
the
corner
of
the
drew
it
instantaneously
with
him
to
the
floor
involving
plates
cups
and
saucers
in
one
promiscuous
ruin
but
as
the
principal
of
the
breakfast
apparatus
was
on
the
little
butler
the
confusion
occasioned
by
this
accident
was
happily
greater
than
the
damage
miss
tenorina
was
so
agitated
that
she
was
obliged
to
retire
miss
graziosa
accompanied
her
through
pure
sisterly
affection
and
sympathy
not
without
a
lingering
look
at
sir
patrick
who
likewise
retired
to
change
his
coat
but
was
very
expeditious
in
returning
to
resume
his
attack
on
the
cold
partridge
the
broken
cups
were
cleared
away
the
cloth
relaid
and
the
array
of
the
table
restored
with
wonderful
celerity
mr
escot
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
scene
of
confusion
which
signalised
his
entrance
but
perfectly
unconscious
that
it
originated
with
the
skull
of
cadwallader
he
advanced
to
seat
himself
at
the
table
by
the
side
of
the
beautiful
cephalis
first
placing
the
skull
in
a
corner
out
of
the
reach
of
mr
cranium
who
sate
eyeing
it
with
lively
curiosity
and
after
several
efforts
to
restrain
his
impatience
exclaimed
you
seem
to
have
found
a
rarity
a
rarity
indeed
said
mr
escot
cracking
an
egg
as
he
spoke
no
less
than
the
genuine
and
indubitable
skull
of
cadwallader
the
skull
of
cadwallader
vociferated
mr
cranium
o
treasure
of
treasures
mr
escot
then
detailed
by
what
means
he
had
become
possessed
of
it
which
gave
birth
to
various
remarks
from
the
other
individuals
of
the
party
after
which
rising
from
table
and
taking
the
skull
again
in
his
hand
this
skull
said
he
is
the
skull
of
a
hero
and
sufficiently
demonstrates
a
point
concerning
which
i
never
myself
entertained
a
doubt
that
the
human
race
is
undergoing
a
gradual
process
of
diminution
in
length
breadth
and
thickness
observe
this
skull
even
the
skull
of
our
reverend
friend
which
is
the
largest
and
thickest
in
the
company
is
not
more
than
half
its
size
the
frame
this
skull
belonged
to
could
scarcely
have
been
less
than
nine
feet
high
such
is
the
lamentable
progress
of
degeneracy
and
decay
in
the
course
of
ages
a
boot
of
the
present
generation
would
form
an
ample
chateau
for
a
large
family
of
our
remote
posterity
the
mind
too
participates
in
the
contraction
of
the
body
poets
and
philosophers
of
all
ages
and
nations
have
lamented
this
too
visible
process
of
physical
and
moral
deterioration

given

to

their
more
vicious
progeny
who
in
our
turn
shall
become
the
parents
of
a
still
viler
generation
you
all
know
the
fable
of
the
buried
pict
who
bit
off
the
end
of
a
pickaxe
with
which
sacrilegious
hands
were
breaking
open
his
grave
and
called
out
with
a
voice
like
subterranean
thunder
perceive
the
degeneracy
of
your
race
by
the
smallness
of
your
little
finger
videlicet
the
pickaxe
this
to
be
sure
is
a
fiction
but
it
shows
the
prevalent
opinion
the
feeling
the
conviction
of
absolute
universal
irremediable
deterioration
i
should
be
sorry
said
mr
foster
that
such
an
opinion
should
become
universal
independently
of
my
conviction
of
its
fallacy
its
general
admission
would
tend
in
a
great
measure
to
produce
the
very
evils
it
appears
to
lament
what
could
be
its
effect
but
to
check
the
ardour
of
investigation
to
extinguish
the
zeal
of
philanthropy
to
freeze
the
current
of
enterprising
hope
to
bury
in
the
torpor
of
scepticism
and
in
the
stagnation
of
despair
every
better
faculty
of
the
human
mind
which
will
necessarily
become
retrograde
in
ceasing
to
be
progressive
i
am
inclined
to
think
on
the
contrary
said
mr
escot
that
the
deterioration
of
man
is
accelerated
by
his
blindness
in
many
respects
wilful
blindness
to
the
truth
of
the
fact
itself
and
to
the
causes
which
produce
it
that
there
is
no
hope
whatever
of
ameliorating
his
condition
but
in
a
total
and
radical
change
of
the
whole
scheme
of
human
life
and
that
the
advocates
of
his
indefinite
perfectibility
are
in
reality
the
greatest
enemies
to
the
practical
possibility
of
their
own
system
by
so
strenuously
labouring
to
impress
on
his
attention
that
he
is
going
on
in
a
good
way
while
he
is
really
in
a
deplorably
bad
one
i
admit
said
mr
foster
there
are
many
things
that
may
and
therefore
will
be
changed
for
the
better
not
on
the
present
system
said
mr
escot
in
which
every
change
is
for
the
worse
in
matters
of
taste
i
am
sure
it
is

the
anniversary
among
the
alba
creta
which
the
beau
monde
of
the
cambrian
mountains
was
in
the
habit
of
remembering
with
the
greatest
pleasure
and
anticipating
with
the
most
lively
satisfaction
was
the
christmas
ball
which
the
ancient
family
of
the
headlongs
had
been
accustomed
to
give
from
time
immemorial
tradition
attributed
the
honour
of
its
foundation
to
headlong
who
lived
about
the
time
of
the
trojan
war
certain
it
is
at
least
that
a
grand
chorus
was
always
sung
after
supper
in
honour
of
this
illustrious
ancestor
of
the
squire
this
ball
was
indeed
an
aera
in
the
lives
of
all
the
beauty
and
fashion
of
caernarvon
meirionnydd
and
anglesea
and
like
the
greek
olympiads
and
the
roman
consulates
served
as
the
main
pillar
of
memory
round
which
all
the
events
of
the
year
were
suspended
and
entwined
thus
in
recalling
to
mind
any
circumstance
imperfectly
recollected
the
principal
point
to
be
ascertained
was
whether
it
had
occurred
in
the
year
of
the
first
second
third
or
fourth
ball
of
headlong
or
headlong
or

this
being

established

had
left
them
to
enjoy

the
returning

the

was
renewed
on
all
the

in
the
meanwhile

not

by
the
male
part
of
the
assembly
with
them
indeed
a
ball
was
invariably
a
scene
of
dance
and
the
servants
flew
about
with
wine
and
negus
and
the
little
butler
was
indefatigable
with
his
corkscrew
which
is
reported
on
one
occasion
to
have
grown
so
hot
under
the
influence
of
perpetual
friction
that
it
actually
set

on

occasion
was

uncommon
celerity

attention

concluding

would
finish
his
speech
by

the

accordingly
tossed
off

mr

proceeded

he
suddenly
changing
his
tone
to
get
everything
ready
in
the
library
saying
these
words
he
vanished
the
welsh
squires
now
imagined
they
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
meaning
and
set
him
down
in
their
minds
for
a
sort
of
gentleman
conjuror
who
intended
to
amuse
them
before
the
ball
with
some
tricks
of
legerdemain
under
this
impression
they
became
very
impatient
to
follow
him
as
they
had
made
up
their
minds
not
to
be
drunk
before
supper
the
ladies
too
were
extremely
curious
to
witness
an
exhibition
which
had
been
announced
in
so
singular
a
preamble
and
the
squire
having
previously
insisted
on
every
gentleman
tossing
off
a
bumper
adjourned
the
whole
party
to
the
library
where
they
were
not
a
little
surprised
to
discover
mr
cranium
seated
in
a
pensive
attitude
at
a
large
table
decorated
with
a
copious
variety
of
skulls
some
of
the
ladies
were
so
much
shocked
at
this
extraordinary
display
that
a
scene
of
great
confusion
ensued
fans
were
very
actively
exercised
and
water
was
strenuously
called
for
by
some
of
the
most
officious
of
the
gentlemen
on
which
the
little
butler
entered
with
a
large
allowance
of
liquid
which
bore
indeed
the
name
of
but
was
in
reality
a
very
powerful
spirit
this
was
the
only
species
of
water
which
the
little
butler
had
ever
heard
called
for
in
headlong
hall
the
mistake
was
not
attended
with
any
evil
effects
for
the
fluid
was
no
sooner
applied
to
the
lips
of
the
fainting
fair
ones
than
it
resuscitated
them
with
an
expedition
truly
miraculous
order
was
at
length
restored
the
audience
took
their
seats
and
the
craniological
orator
held
forth
in
the
following
terms
chapter
xii
the
lecture
physiologists
have
been
much
puzzled
to
account
for
the
varieties
of
moral
character
in
men
as
well
as
for
the
remarkable
similarity
of
habit
and
disposition
in
all
the
individual
animals
of
every
other
respective
species
a
few
brief
sentences
perspicuously
worded
and
scientifically
arranged
will
enumerate
all
the
characteristics
of
a
lion
or
a
tiger
or
a
wolf
or
a
bear
or
a
squirrel
or
a
goat
or
a
horse
or
an
ass
or
a
rat
or
a
cat
or
a
hog
or
a
dog
and
whatever
is
physiologically
predicted
of
any
individual
lion
tiger
wolf
bear
squirrel
goat
horse
ass
hog
or
dog
will
be
found
to
hold
true
of
all
lions
tigers
wolves
bears
squirrels
goats
horses
asses
hogs
and
dogs
whatsoever
now
in
man
the
very
reverse
of
this
appears
to
be
the
case
for
he
has
so
few
distinct
and
characteristic
marks
which
hold
true
of
all
his
species
that
philosophers
in
all
ages
have
found
it
a
task
of
infinite
difficulty
to
give
him
a
definition
hence
one
has
defined
him
to
be
a
a
definition
which
is
equally
applicable
to
an
unfledged
fowl
another
to
be
animal
which
forms
than
which
nothing
can
be
more
inaccurate
for
a
very
small
number
of
the
species
form
opinions
and
the
remainder
take
them
upon
trust
without
investigation
or
inquiry
again
man
has
been
defined
to
be
animal
that
carries
a
an
attribute
which
undoubtedly
belongs
to
man
only
but
not
to
all
men
always
though
it
uniformly
characterises
some
of
the
graver
and
more
imposing
varieties
such
as
physicians
and
lords
in
waiting
we
can
not
define
man
to
be
a
reasoning
animal
for
we
do
not
dispute
that
idiots
are
men
to
say
nothing
of
that
very
numerous
description
of
persons
who
consider
themselves
reasoning
animals
and
are
so
denominated
by
the
ironical
courtesy
of
the
world
who
labour
nevertheless
under
a
very
gross
delusion
in
that
essential
particular
it
appears
to
me
that
man
may
be
correctly
defined
an
animal
which
without
any
peculiar
or
distinguishing
faculty
of
its
own
is
as
it
were
a
bundle
or
compound
of
faculties
of
other
animals
by
a
distinct
enumeration
of
which
any
individual
of
the
species
may
be
satisfactorily
described
this
is
manifest
even
in
the
ordinary
language
of
conversation
when
in
summing
up
for
example
the
qualities
of
an
accomplished
courtier
we
say
he
has
the
vanity
of
a
peacock
the
cunning
of
a
fox
the
treachery
of
an
hyaena
the
of
a
cat
and
the
servility
of
a
jackal
that
this
is
perfectly
consentaneous
to
scientific
truth
will
appear
in
the
further
progress
of
these
observations
every
particular
faculty
of
the
mind
has
its
corresponding
organ
in
the
brain
in
proportion
as
any
particular
faculty
or
propensity
acquires
paramount
activity
in
any
individual
these
organs
develope
themselves
and
their
development
becomes
externally
obvious
by
corresponding
lumps
and
bumps
exuberances
and
protuberances
on
the
osseous
compages
of
the
occiput
and
sinciput
in
all
animals
but
man
the
same
organ
is
equally
developed
in
every
individual
of
the
species
for
instance
that
of
migration
in
the
swallow
that
of
destruction
in
the
tiger
that
of
architecture
in
the
beaver
and
that
of
parental
affection
in
the
bear
the
human
brain
however
consists
as
i
have
said
of
a
bundle
or
compound
of
all
the
faculties
of
all
other
animals
and
from
the
greater
development
of
one
or
more
of
these
in
the
infinite
varieties
of
combination
result
all
the
peculiarities
of
individual
character
here
is
the
skull
of
a
beaver
and
that
of
sir
christopher
wren
you
observe
in
both
these
specimens
the
prodigious
development
of
the
organ
of
constructiveness
here
is
the
skull
of
a
bullfinch
and
that
of
an
eminent
fiddler
you
may
compare
the
organ
of
music
here
is
the
skull
of
a
tiger
you
observe
the
organ
of
carnage
here
is
the
skull
of
a
fox
you
observe
the
organ
of
plunder
here
is
the
skull
of
a
peacock
you
observe
the
organ
of
vanity
here
is
the
skull
of
an
illustrious
robber
who
after
a
long
and
triumphant
process
of
depredation
and
murder
was
suddenly
checked
in
his
career
by
means
of
a
certain
quality
inherent
in
preparations
of
hemp
which
for
the
sake
of
perspicuity
i
shall
call
here
is
the
skull
of
a
conqueror
who
after
several
kingdoms
burning
a
number
of
cities
and
causing
the
deaths
of
two
or
three
millions
of
men
women
and
children
was
entombed
with
all
the
pageantry
of
public
lamentation
and
figured
as
the
hero
of
several
thousand
odes
and
a
round
dozen
of
epics
while
the
poor
highwayman
was
twice
executed
the
gallows
first
and
after
in
a
ballad
sung
to
a
villainous
tune
you
observe
in
both
these
skulls
the
combined
development
of
the
organs
of
carnage
plunder
and
vanity
which
i
have
separately
pointed
out
in
the
tiger
the
fox
and
the
peacock
the
greater
enlargement
of
the
organ
of
vanity
in
the
hero
is
the
only
criterion
by
which
i
can
distinguish
them
from
each
other
born
with
the
same
faculties
and
the
same
propensities
these
two
men
were
formed
by
nature
to
run
the
same
career
the
different
combinations
of
external
circumstances
decided
the
differences
of
their
destinies
here
is
the
skull
of
a
newfoundland
dog
you
observe
the
organ
of
benevolence
and
that
of
attachment
here
is
a
human
skull
in
which
you
may
observe
a
very
striking
negation
of
both
these
organs
and
an
equally
striking
development
of
those
of
destruction
cunning
avarice
and
this
was
one
of
the
most
illustrious
statesmen
that
ever
flourished
in
the
page
of
history
here
is
the
skull
of
a
turnspit
which
after
a
wretched
life
of
was
turned
out
of
doors
to
die
on
a
dunghill
i
have
been
induced
to
preserve
it
in
consequence
of
its
remarkable
similarity
to
this
which
belonged
to
a
courtly
poet
who
having
grown
grey
in
flattering
the
great
was
cast
off
in
the
same
manner
to
perish
by
the
same
catastrophe
these
and
several
other
illustrations
during
which
the
skulls
were
handed
round
for
the
inspection
of
the
company
mr
cranium
proceeded
thus
it
is
obvious
from
what
i
have
said
that
no
man
can
hope
for
worldly
honour
or
advancement
who
is
not
placed
in
such
a
relation
to
external
circumstances
as
may
be
consentaneous
to
his
peculiar
cerebral
organs
and
i
would
advise
every
parent
who
has
the
welfare
of
his
son
at
heart
to
procure
as
extensive
a
collection
as
possible
of
the
skulls
of
animals
and
before
determining
on
the
choice
of
a
profession
to
compare
with
the
utmost
nicety
their
bumps
and
protuberances
with
those
of
the
skull
of
his
son
if
the
development
of
the
organ
of
destruction
point
out
a
similarity
between
the
youth
and
the
tiger
let
him
be
brought
to
some
profession
whether
that
of
a
butcher
a
soldier
or
a
physician
may
be
regulated
by
circumstances
in
which
he
may
be
furnished
with
a
licence
to
kill
as
without
such
licence
the
indulgence
of
his
natural
propensity
may
lead
to
the
untimely
rescission
of
his
vital
thread
edge
of
penny
cord
and
vile
reproach
if
he
show
an
analogy
with
the
jackal
let
all
possible
influence
be
used
to
procure
him
a
place
at
court
where
he
will
infallibly
thrive
if
his
skull
bear
a
marked
resemblance
to
that
of
a
magpie
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
he
will
prove
an
admirable
lawyer
and
if
with
this
advantageous
conformation
be
combined
any
similitude
to
that
of
an
owl
very
confident
hopes
may
be
formed
of
his
becoming
a
judge
a
furious
flourish
of
music
was
now
heard
from
the
the
squire
having
secretly
dispatched
the
little
butler
to
order
it
to
strike
up
by
way
of
a
hint
to
mr
cranium
to
finish
his
harangue
the
company
took
the
hint
and
adjourned
tumultuously
having
just
understood
as
much
of
the
lecture
as
furnished
them
with
amusement
for
the
ensuing
twelvemonth
in
feeling
the
skulls
of
all
their
acquaintance

adorned
with

taste
and
elegance
under

direction

were

beautiful

on

could

mr

chafed
and
fretted
like
llugwy
in
his
bed
of
rocks
when
the
object
of
his
adoration
stood
up
with
his
rival
but
he
consoled
himself
with
a
lively
damsel
from
the
vale
of
edeirnion
having
first
compelled
miss

to
promise
him
her
hand
for
the
fourth
set
the
ball
was
accordingly
opened
by
miss
caprioletta
and
mr
foster
which
gave
rise
to
much
speculation
among
the
welsh
gentry
as
to
who
this
mr
foster
could
be
some
of
the
more
learned
among
them
secretly
resolving
to
investigate
most
profoundly
the
antiquity
of
the
name
of
foster
and
ascertain
what
right
a
person
so
denominated
could
have
to
open
the
most
illustrious
of
all
possible
balls
with
the
lovely
caprioletta

the

antediluvian

of

when
the
first
two
dances
were
ended
mr
escot
who
did
not
choose
to
dance
with
any
one
but
his
adorable
cephalis
looking
round
for
a
convenient
seat
discovered
mr
jenkison
in
a
corner
by
the
side
of
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
who
was
keeping
excellent
time
with
his
nose
to
the
lively
melody
of
the
harp
and
fiddle
mr
escot
seated
himself
by
the
side
of
mr
jenkison
and
inquired
if
he
took
no
part
in
the
amusement
of
the
night
no
the
universal
cheerfulness
of
the
company
induces
me
to
rise
the
trouble
of
such
violent
exercise
induces
me
to
sit
still
did
i
see
a
young
lady
in
want
of
a
partner
gallantry
would
incite
me
to
offer
myself
as
her
devoted
knight
for
half
an
hour
but
as
i
perceive
there
are
enough
without
me
that
motive
is
null
i
have
been
weighing
these
points
and
and
remain
statu
i
have
danced
contrary
to
my
system
as
i
have
done
many
other
things
since
i
have
been
here
from
a
motive
that
you
will
easily
guess
jenkison
i
have
great
objections
to
dancing
the
wild
and
original
man
is
a
calm
and
contemplative
animal
the
stings
of
natural
appetite
alone
rouse
him
to
action
he
satisfies
his
hunger
with
roots
and
fruits
unvitiated
by
the
malignant
adhibition
of
fire
and
all
its
diabolical
processes
of
elixion
and
assation
he
slakes
his
thirst
in
the
tae
and
returns
to
his
peaceful
state
of
meditative
repose
like
the
metaphysical
statue
of
condillac
with
all
its
senses
and
purely
natural
faculties
developed
certainly
imagine
this
tranquil
and
passionless
being
occupied
in
his
first
meditation
on
the
simple
question
of
am
i
whence
do
i
come
and
what
is
the
end
of
my
existence
then
suddenly
place
before
him
a
chandelier
a
fiddler
and
a
magnificent
beau
in
silk
stockings
and
pumps
bounding
skipping
swinging
capering
and
throwing
himself
into
ten
thousand
attitudes
till
his
face
glows
with
fever
and
distils
with
perspiration
the
first
impulse
excited
in
his
mind
by
such
an
apparition
will
be
that
of
violent
fear
which
by
the
reiterated
perception
of
its
harmlessness
will
subside
into
simple
astonishment
then
let
any
genius
sufficiently
powerful
to
impress
on
his
mind
all
the
terms
of
the
communication
impart
to
him
that
after
a
long
process
of
ages
when
his
race
shall
have
attained
what
some
people
think
proper
to
denominate
a
very
advanced
stage
of
perfectibility
the
most
favoured
and
distinguished
of
the
community
shall
meet
by
hundreds
to
grin
and
labour
and
gesticulate
like
the
phantasma
before
him
from
sunset
to
sunrise
while
all
nature
is
at
rest
and
that
they
shall
consider
this
a
happy
and
pleasurable
mode
of
existence
and
furnishing
the
most
delightful
of
all
possible
contrasts
to
what
they
will
call
his
vegetative
state
would
he
not
groan
from
his
inmost
soul
for
the
lamentable
condition
of
his
posterity
i
know
not
what
your
wild
and
original
man
might
think
of
the
matter
in
the
abstract
but
comparatively
i
conceive
he
would
be
better
pleased
with
the
vision
of
such
a
scene
as
this
than
with
that
of
a
party
of
indians
who
would
have
all
the
advantage
of
being
nearly
as
wild
as
himself
dancing
their
infernal
round
a
midnight
fire
in
a
north
american
forest
not
if
you
should
impart
to
him
the
true
nature
of
both
by
laying
open
to
his
view
the
springs
of
action
in
both
parties
to
do
this
with
effect
you
must
make
him
a
profound
metaphysician
and
thus
transfer
him
at
once
from
his
wild
and
original
state
to
a
very
advanced
stage
of
intellectual
progression
whether
that
progression
be
towards
good
or
evil
i
leave
you
and
our
friend
foster
to
settle
between
you
i
wish
to
make
no
change
in
his
habits
and
feelings
but
to
give
him
hypothetically
so
much
mental
illumination
as
will
enable
him
to
take
a
clear
view
of
two
distinct
stages
of
the
deterioration
of
his
posterity
that
he
may
be
enabled
to
compare
them
with
each
other
and
with
his
own
more
happy
condition
the
indian
dancing
round
the
midnight
fire
is
very
far
deteriorated
but
the
magnificent
beau
dancing
to
the
light
of
chandeliers
is
infinitely
more
so
the
indian
is
a
hunter
he
makes
great
use
of
fire
and
subsists
almost
entirely
on
animal
food
the
malevolent
passions
that
spring
from
these
pernicious
habits
involve
him
in
perpetual
war
he
is
therefore
necessitated
for
his
own
preservation
to
keep
all
the
energies
of
his
nature
in
constant
activity
to
this
end
his
midnight
is
very
powerfully
subservient
and
though
in
itself
a
frightful
spectacle
is
at
least
justifiable
on
the
iron
plea
of
necessity
on
the
same
iron
plea
the
modern
system
of
dancing
is
more
justifiable
the
indian
dances
to
prepare
himself
for
killing
his
enemy
but
while
the
beaux
and
belles
of
our
assemblies
dance
they
are
in
the
very
act
of
killing
theirs
time
a
more
inveterate
and
formidable
foe
than
any
the
indian
has
to
contend
with
for
however
completely
and
ingeniously
killed
he
is
sure
to
rise
again
with
twenty
mortal
murders
on
his
crown
leading
his
army
of
blue
devils
with
ennui
in
the
van
and
vapours
in
the
rear
your
observation
militates
on
my
side
of
the
question
and
it
is
a
strong
argument
in
favour
of
the
indian
that
he
has
no
such
enemy
to
kill
there
is
certainly
a
great
deal
to
be
said
against
dancing
there
is
also
a
great
deal
to
be
said
in
its
favour
the
first
side
of
the
question
i
leave
for
the
present
to
you
on
the
latter
i
may
venture
to
allege
that
no
amusement
seems
more
natural
and
more
congenial
to
youth
than
this
it
has
the
advantage
of
bringing
young
persons
of
both
sexes
together
in
a
manner
which
its
publicity
renders
perfectly
unexceptionable
enabling
them
to
see
and
know
each
other
better
than
perhaps
any
other
mode
of
general
association
are
dangerous
things
small
family
parties
are
too
much
under
mutual
observation
a
appears
to
me
almost
the
only
scene
uniting
that
degree
of
rational
and
innocent
liberty
of
intercourse
which
it
is
desirable
to
promote
as
much
as
possible
between
young
persons
with
that
scrupulous
attention
to
the
delicacy
and
propriety
of
female
conduct
which
i
consider
the
fundamental
basis
of
all
our
most
valuable
social
relations
there
would
be
some
plausibility
in
your
argument
if
it
were
not
the
very
essence
of
this
species
of
intercourse
to
exhibit
them
to
each
other
under
false
colours
here
all
is
show
and
varnish
and
hypocrisy
and
coquetry
they
dress
up
their
moral
character
for
the
evening
at
the
same
toilet
where
they
manufacture
their
shapes
and
faces
lies
buried
under
a
studied
accumulation
of
smiles
envy
hatred
and
malice
retreat
from
the
countenance
to
entrench
themselves
more
deeply
in
the
heart
treachery
lurks
under
the
flowers
of
courtesy
ignorance
and
folly
take
refuge
in
that
unmeaning
gabble
which
it
would
be
profanation
to
call
language
and
which
even
those
whom
long
experience
in
the
dreary
intercourse
of
daily
life
has
screwed
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
stoical
endurance
that
they
can
listen
to
it
by
the
hour
have
branded
with
the
ignominious
appellation
of
small
indeed
the
absolute
minimum
of
the
infinitely
little
go
on
i
have
said
all
i
intended
to
say
on
the
favourable
side
i
shall
have
great
pleasure
in
hearing
you
balance
the
argument
i
expect
you
to
confess
that
i
shall
have
more
than
balanced
it
a
is
an
epitome
of
all
that
is
most
worthless
and
unamiable
in
the
great
sphere
of
human
life
every
petty
and
malignant
passion
is
called
into
play
coquetry
is
perpetually
on
the
alert
to
captivate
caprice
to
mortify
and
vanity
to
take
offence
one
amiable
female
is
rendered
miserable
for
the
evening
by
seeing
another
whom
she
intended
to
outshine
in
a
more
attractive
dress
than
her
own
while
the
other
omits
no
method
of
giving
stings
to
her
triumph
which
she
enjoys
with
all
the
secret
arrogance
of
an
oriental
sultana
another
is
compelled
to
dance
with
a
she
abhors
a
third
has
set
her
heart
on
dancing
with
a
particular
partner
perhaps
for
the
amiable
motive
of
annoying
one
of
her
not
only
he
does
not
ask
her
but
she
sees
him
dancing
with
that
identical
whom
from
that
moment
she
hates
more
cordially
than
ever
perhaps
what
is
worse
than
all
she
has
set
her
heart
on
refusing
some
impertinent
fop
who
does
not
give
her
the
as
to
the
men
the
case
is
very
nearly
the
same
with
them
to
be
sure
they
have
the
privilege
of
making
the
first
advances
and
are
therefore
less
liable
to
have
an
odious
partner
forced
upon
them
though
this
sometimes
happens
as
i
know
by
woeful
experience
but
it
is
seldom
they
can
procure
the
very
partner
they
prefer
and
when
they
do
the
absurd
necessity
of
changing
every
two
dances
forces
them
away
and
leaves
them
only
the
miserable
alternative
of
taking
up
with
something
disagreeable
perhaps
in
itself
and
at
all
events
rendered
so
by
contrast
or
of
retreating
into
some
solitary
corner
to
vent
their
spleen
on
the
first
idle
coxcomb
they
can
find
i
hope
that
is
not
the
motive
which
brings
you
to
me
clearly
not
but
the
most
afflicting
consideration
of
all
is
that
these
malignant
and
miserable
feelings
are
masked
under
that
uniform
disguise
of
pretended
benevolence
fine
and
delicate
irony
called
politeness
which
gives
so
much
ease
and
pliability
to
the
mutual
intercourse
of
civilised
man
and
enables
him
to
assume
the
appearance
of
every
virtue
without
the
reality
of
the
second
set
of
dances
was
now
terminated
and
mr
escot
flew
off
to
reclaim
the
hand
of
the
beautiful
cephalis
with
whom
he
figured
away
with
surprising
alacrity
and
probably
felt
at
least
as
happy
among
the
chandeliers
and
silk
stockings
at
which
he
had
just
been
railing
as
he
would
have
been
in
an
american
forest
making
one
in
an
indian
ring
by
the
light
of
a
blazing
fire
even
though
his
hand
had
been
locked
in
that
of
the
most
beautiful
that
ever
listened
to
the
roar
of
niagara
squire
headlong
was
now
beset
by
his
maiden
aunt
miss
grimalkin
phoebe
tabitha
on
one
side
and
sir
patrick
on
the
other
the
former
insisting
that
he
should
immediately
procure
her
a
partner
the
latter
earnestly
requesting
the
same
interference
in
behalf
of
miss
philomela
poppyseed
the
squire
thought
to
emancipate
himself
from
his
two
petitioners
by
making
them
dance
with
each
other
but
sir
patrick
vehemently
pleading
a
prior
engagement
the
squire
threw
his
eyes
around
till
they
alighted
on
mr
jenkison
and
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
both
of
whom
after
waking
the
latter
he
pressed
into
the
service
the
doctor
arising
with
a
strange
kind
of
guttural
sound
which
was
half
a
yawn
and
half
a
groan
was
handed
by
the
officious
squire
to
miss
philomela
who
received
him
with
sullen
dignity
she
had
not
yet
forgotten
his
falling
asleep
during
the
first
chapter
of
her
novel
while
she
was
condescending
to
detail
to
him
the
outlines
of
four
superlative
volumes
the
doctor
on
his
part
had
most
completely
forgotten
it
and
though
he
thought
there
was
something
in
her
physiognomy
rather
more
forbidding
than
usual
he
gave
himself
no
concern
about
the
cause
and
had
not
the
least
suspicion
that
it
was
at
all
connected
with
himself
miss
was
very
well
contented
with
mr
jenkison
and
gave
him
two
or
three
ogles
accompanied
by
a
most
risible
distortion
of
the
countenance
which
she
intended
for
a
captivating
smile
as
to
mr
jenkison
it
was
all
one
to
him
with
whom
he
danced
or
whether
he
danced
or
not
he
was
therefore
just
as
well
pleased
as
if
he
had
been
left
alone
in
his
corner
which
is
probably
more
than
could
have
been
said
of
any
other
human
being
under
similar
circumstances
at
the
end
of
the
third
set
supper
was
announced
and
the
party
pairing
off
like
turtles
adjourned
to
the
the
squire
was
now
the
happiest
of
mortal
men
and
the
little
butler
the
most
laborious
the
centre
of
the
largest
table
was
decorated
with
a
model
of
snowdon
surmounted
with
an
enormous
artificial
leek
the
leaves
of
angelica
and
the
bulb
of
blancmange
a
little
way
from
the
summit
was
a
tarn
or
supplied
through
concealed
tubes
with
an
inexhaustible
flow
of
which
dashing
in
cascades
down
the
miniature
rocks
fell
into
the
more
capacious
lake
below
washing
the
mimic
foundations
of
headlong
hall
the
reverend
doctor
handed
miss
philomela
to
the
chair
most
conveniently
situated
for
enjoying
this
interesting
scene
protesting
he
had
never
before
been
sufficiently
impressed
with
the
magnificence
of
that
mountain
which
he
now
perceived
to
be
well
worthy
of
all
the
fame
it
had
obtained
now
when
they
had
eaten
and
were
satisfied
squire
headlong
called
on
mr
chromatic
for
a
song
who
with
the
assistance
of
his
two
accomplished
daughters
regaled
the
ears
of
the
company
with
the
following
terzetto
grey
twilight
from
her
shadowy
hill
discolours
nature
vernal
bloom
and
sheds
on
grove
and
field
and
rill
one
placid
tint
of
deepening
gloom
the
sailor
sighs
shoreless
seas
touched
by
the
thought
of
friends
afar
as
fanned
by
ocean
flowing
breeze
he
gazes
on
the
western
star
the
wanderer
hears
in
pensive
dream
the
accents
of
the
last
farewell
as
pausing
by
the
mountain
stream
he
listens
to
the
evening
bell
this
terzetto
was
of
course
much
applauded
mr
milestone
observing
that
he
thought
the
figure
in
the
last
verse
would
have
been
more
picturesque
if
it
had
been
represented
with
its
arms
folded
and
its
back
against
a
tree
or
leaning
on
its
staff
with
a
in
its
hat
like
a
pilgrim
of
ancient
times
mr
chromatic
professed
himself
astonished
that
a
gentleman
of
genuine
modern
taste
like
mr
milestone
should
consider
the
words
of
a
song
of
any
consequence
whatever
seeing
that
they
were
at
the
best
only
a
species
of
pegs
for
the
more
convenient
suspension
of
crotchets
and
quavers
this
remark
drew
on
him
a
very
severe
reprimand
from
mr
mac
laurel
who
said
to
him
dinna
ye
ken
sir
that
soond
is
a
thing
utterly
worthless
in
itsel
and
only
effectual
in
agreeable
excitements
as
far
as
it
is
an
aicho
to
sense
is
there
ony
soond
mair
meeserable
an
peetifu
than
the
scrape
o
a
feddle
when
it
does
na
touch
ony
chord
i
the
human
sensorium
is
there
ony
mair
divine
than
the
deep
note
o
a
bagpipe
when
it
breathes
the
auncient
meelodies
o
leeberty
an
love
it
is
true
there
are
peculiar
trains
o
feeling
an
sentiment
which
parteecular
combinations
o
meelody
are
calculated
to
excite
an
sae
far
music
can
produce
its
effect
without
words
but
it
does
na
follow
that
when
ye
put
words
to
it
it
becomes
a
matter
of
indefference
what
they
are
for
a
gude
strain
of
impassioned
poetry
will
greatly
increase
the
effect
and
a
tessue
o
nonsensical
doggrel
will
destroy
it
a
thegither
noo
as
gude
poetry
can
produce
its
effect
without
music
sae
will
gude
music
without
poetry
and
as
gude
music
will
be
mair
pooerfu
by
itsel
than
wi
bad
poetry
sae
will
gude
poetry
than
wi
bad
music
but
when
ye
put
gude
music
an
gude
poetry
thegither
ye
produce
the
divinest
compound
o
sentimental
harmony
that
can
possibly
find
its
way
through
the
lug
to
the
saul
mr
chromatic
admitted
that
there
was
much
justice
in
these
observations
but
still
maintained
the
subserviency
of
poetry
to
music
mr
mac
laurel
as
strenuously
maintained
the
contrary
and
a
furious
war
of
words
was
proceeding
to
perilous
lengths
when
the
squire
interposed
his
authority
towards
the
reproduction
of
peace
which
was
forthwith
concluded
and
all
animosities
drowned
in
a
libation
of
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
officiating
as
high
priest
on
the
occasion
mr
chromatic
now
requested
miss
caprioletta
to
favour
the
company
with
an
air
the
young
lady
immediately
complied
and
sung
the
following
simple
ballad
o
mary
my
sister
thy
sorrow
give
i
soon
shall
return
girl
and
leave
thee
no
more
but
with
children
so
fair
and
a
husband
so
kind
i
shall
feel
less
regret
when
i
leave
thee
behind
i
have
made
thee
a
bench
for
the
door
of
thy
cot
and
more
would
i
give
thee
but
more
i
have
not
sit
and
think
of
me
there
in
the
warm
summer
day
and
give
me
three
kisses
my
labour
to
pay
she
gave
him
three
kisses
and
forth
did
he
fare
and
long
did
he
wander
and
no
one
knew
where
and
long
from
her
cottage
through
sunshine
and
rain
she
watched
his
return
but
he
came
not
again
her
children
grew
up
and
her
husband
grew
grey
she
sate
on
the
bench
through
the
long
summer
day
one
evening
when
twilight
was
deep
on
the
shore
there
came
an
old
soldier
and
stood
by
the
door
in
english
he
spoke
and
none
knew
what
he
said
but
her
oatcake
and
milk
on
the
table
she
spread
then
he
sate
to
his
supper
and
blithely
he
sung
and
she
knew
the
dear
sounds
of
her
own
native
tongue
o
rich
are
the
feasts
in
the
englishman
hall
and
the
wine
sparkles
bright
in
the
goblets
of
gaul
but
their
mingled
attractions
i
well
could
withstand
for
the
milk
and
the
oatcake
of
meirion
dear
land
and
art
thou
a
welchman
old
soldier
she
cried
many
years

i
wandered
the
stranger
replied
danube
and

but
the
bright
waves
of
cynfael
are
fairest
to
me
i
felled
the
grey
oak
ere
i
hastened
to
roam
and
i
fashioned
a
bench
for
the
door
of
my
home
and
well
my
dear
sister
my
labour
repaid
who
gave
me
three
kisses
when
first
it
was
made

the
old
english

oatcake
and
milk
in
return
for
my
store
and
a
seat
by
thy
side
on
the
bench
at
the
door
various
other
songs
succeeded
which
as
we
are
not
composing
a
song
book
we
shall
lay
aside
for
the
present
an
old
squire
who
had
not
missed
one
of
these
anniversaries
during
more
than
half
a
century
now
stood
up
and
filling
a
bumper
pronounced
with
a
stentorian
voice
to
the
immortal
memory
of
headlong
and
to
the
health
of
his
noble
descendant
and
worthy
representative
this
example
was
followed
by
all
the
gentlemen
present
the
harp
struck
up
a
triumphal
strain
and
the
old
squire
already
mentioned
vociferating
the
first
stave
they
sang
or
rather
roared
the
following
chorus
hail
to
the
headlong
the
headlong
all
hail
to
the
headlong
the
headlong
the
headlong
the
bright
bowl
we
steep
in
the
name
of
the
headlong
let
the
youths
pledge
it
deep
to
the
headlong
and
the
lasses
touch
the
brim
as
it
passes
and
kiss
the
red
tide
for
the
headlong
the
loud
harp
resounds
in
the
hall
of
the
headlong
the
light
step
rebounds
in
the
hall
of
the
headlong
where
shall
music
invite
us
or
beauty
delight
us
if
not
in
the
hall
of
the
headlong
huzza
to
the
health
of
the
headlong

the
bowl
fill
in
floods
to
the
health
of
the
headlong
till
the
stream
on
all
sides
shall
fall
in
cascades
to
the
health
of
the
headlong
the
headlong
squire
headlong
returned
thanks
with
an
appropriate
libation
and
the
company
to
the
ballroom
where
they
kept
it
up
till
sunrise
when
the
little
butler
summoned
them
to
breakfast
chapter
xiv
the
proposals
the
chorus
which
celebrated
the
antiquity
of
her
lineage
had
been
ringing
all
night
in
the
ears
of
miss
grimalkin
phoebe
tabitha
when
taking
the
squire
aside
while
the
visitors
were
sipping
their
tea
and
coffee
nephew
harry
said
she
i
have
been
noting
your
behaviour
during
the
several
stages
of
the
ball
and
supper
and
though
i
can
not
tax
you
with
any
want
of
gallantry
for
you
are
a
very
gallant
young
man
nephew
harry
very
gallant
i
wish
i
could
say
as
much
for
every
one
added
she
throwing
a
spiteful
look
towards
a
distant
corner
where
mr
jenkison
was
sitting
with
great
and
at
the
moment
dipping
a
rusk
in
a
cup
of
chocolate
but
i
lament
to
perceive
that
you
were
at
least
as
pleased
with
your
lakes
of
and
your
bottles
of
champagne
and
burgundy
as
with
any
of
your
delightful
partners
now
though
i
can
readily
excuse
this
degree
of
incombustibility
in
the
descendant
of
a
family
so
remarkable
in
all
ages
for
personal
beauty
as
ours
yet
i
lament
it
exceedingly
when
i
consider
that
in
conjunction
with
your
present
predilection
for
the
easy
life
of
a
bachelor
it
may
possibly
prove
the
means
of
causing
our
ancient
genealogical
tree
which
has
its
roots
if
i
may
so
speak
in
the
foundations
of
the
world
to
terminate
suddenly
in
a
point
unless
you
feel
yourself
moved
by
my
exhortations
to
follow
the
example
of
all
your
ancestors
by
choosing
yourself
a
fitting
and
suitable
helpmate
to
immortalize
the
pedigree
of
headlong
egad
said
squire
headlong
that
is
very
true
i
marry
directly
a
good
opportunity
to
fix
on
some
one
now
they
are
all
here
and
pop
the
question
without
further
ceremony
what
think
you
said
the
old
lady
of
miss
nanny
the
lineal
descendant
of
llewelyn
she
wo
do
said
squire
headlong
what
say
you
then
said
the
lady
to
miss
williams
of
pontyglasrhydyrallt
the
descendant
of
the
ancient
family
of
i
do
like
her
said
squire
headlong
and
as
to
her
ancient
family
that
is
a
matter
of
no
consequence
i
have
antiquity
enough
for
two
they
are
all
moderns
people
of
yesterday
in
comparison
with
us
what
signify
six
or
seven
centuries
which
are
the
most
they
can
make
up
why
to
be
sure
said
the
aunt
on
that
view
of
the
question
it
is
no
consequence
what
think
you
then
of
miss
owen
of
she
will
have
six
thousand
a
year
i
would
not
have
her
said
squire
headlong
if
she
had
fifty
think
of
somebody
presently
i
should
like
to
be
married
on
the
same
day
with
caprioletta
caprioletta
said
miss
without
my
being
consulted
consulted
said
the
squire
i
was
commissioned
to
tell
you
but
somehow
or
other
i
let
it
slip
however
she
is
going
to
be
married
to
my
friend
mr
foster
the
philosopher
oh
said
the
maiden
aunt
that
a
daughter
of
our
ancient
family
should
marry
a
philosopher
it
is
enough
to
make
the
bones
of
all
the
turn
in
their
graves
i
happen
to
be
more
enlightened
said
squire
headlong
than
any
of
my
ancestors
were
besides
it
is
caprioletta
affair
not
mine
i
tell
you
the
matter
is
settled
fixed
determined
and
so
am
i
to
be
married
on
the
same
day
i
do
know
now
i
think
of
it
whom
i
can
choose
better
than
one
of
the
daughters
of
my
friend
chromatic
a
saxon
said
the
aunt
turning
up
her
nose
and
was
commencing
a
vehement
remonstrance
but
the
squire
exclaiming
music
has
charms
flew
over
to
mr
chromatic
and
with
a
hearty
slap
on
the
shoulder
asked
him
how
he
should
like
him
for
a
mr
chromatic
rubbing
his
shoulder
and
highly
delighted
with
the
proposal
answered
very
much
indeed
but
proceeding
to
ascertain
which
of
his
daughters
had
captivated
the
squire
the
squire
demurred
and
was
unable
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
i
hope
said
mr
chromatic
it
may
be
tenorina
for
i
imagine
graziosa
has
conceived
a
for
sir
patrick
tenorina
exactly
said
squire
headlong
and
became
so
impatient
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
conclusion
that
mr
chromatic
undertook
to
communicate
with
his
daughter
immediately
the
young
lady
proved
to
be
as
ready
as
the
squire
and
the
preliminaries
were
arranged
in
little
more
than
five
minutes
mr
chromatic
words
that
he
imagined
his
daughter
graziosa
had
conceived
a
for
sir
patrick
were
not
lost
on
the
squire
who
at
once
determined
to
have
as
many
companions
in
the
scrape
as
possible
and
who
as
soon
as
he
could
tear
himself
from
mrs
headlong
elect
took
three
flying
bounds
across
the
room
to
the
baronet
and
said
so
sir
patrick
i
find
you
and
i
are
going
to
be
married
are
we
said
sir
patrick
then
sure
wo
i
wish
you
joy
and
myself
too
for
this
is
the
first
i
have
heard
of
it
well
said
squire
headlong
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
it
and
you
must
not
disappoint
me
to
be
sure
i
wo
if
i
can
help
it
said
sir
patrick
and
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
taking
so
much
trouble
off
my
hands
and
pray
now
who
is
it
that
i
am
to
be
metamorphosing
into
lady
miss
graziosa
chromatic
said
the
squire
och
violet
and
vermilion
said
sir
patrick
though
i
never
thought
of
it
before
i
dare
say
she
will
suit
me
as
well
as
another
but
then
you
must
persuade
the
ould
orpheus
to
draw
out
a
few
of
rather
a
more
magical
description
than
those
he
is
so
fond
of
scraping
on
his
crazy
violin
to
be
sure
he
shall
said
the
squire
and
immediately
returning
to
mr
chromatic
concluded
the
negotiation
for
sir
patrick
as
expeditiously
as
he
had
done
for
himself
the
squire
next
addressed
himself
to
mr
escot
here
are
three
couple
of
us
going
to
throw
off
together
with
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
for
now
i
think
you
can
not
do
better
than
make
the
fourth
with
miss
cephalis
and
then
as
my
that
is
to
be
would
say
we
shall
compose
a
very
harmonious
octave
indeed
said
mr
escot
nothing
would
be
more
agreeable
to
both
of
us
than
such
an
arrangement
but
the
old
gentleman
since
i
first
knew
him
has
changed
like
the
rest
of
the
world
very
lamentably
for
the
worse
now
we
wish
to
bring
him
to
reason
if
possible
though
we
mean
to
dispense
with
his
consent
if
he
should
prove
much
longer
refractory
i
settle
him
said
squire
headlong
and
immediately
posted
up
to
mr
cranium
informing
him
that
four
marriages
were
about
to
take
place
by
way
of
a
merry
winding
up
of
the
christmas
festivities
indeed
said
mr
cranium
and
who
are
the
parties
in
the
first
place
said
the
squire
my
sister
and
mr
foster
in
the
second
miss
graziosa
chromatic
and
sir
patrick
in
the
third
miss
tenorina
chromatic
and
your
humble
servant
and
in
the
fourth
to
which
by
the
by
your
consent
is
wanted
oho
said
mr
cranium
your
daughter
said
squire
headlong
and
mr
panscope
said
mr
cranium
and
mr
escot
said
squire
headlong
what
would
you
have
better
he
has
ten
thousand
virtues
so
has
mr
panscope
said
mr
cranium
he
has
ten
thousand
a
year
virtues
said
squire
headlong
pounds
said
mr
cranium
i
have
set
my
mind
on
mr
escot
said
the
squire
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
said
mr
cranium
for
dethroning
me
from
my
paternal
authority
who
fished
you
out
of
the
water
said
squire
headlong
what
is
that
to
the
purpose
said
mr
cranium
the
whole
process
of
the
action
was
mechanical
and
necessary
the
application
of
the
poker
necessitated
the
ignition
of
the
powder
the
ignition
necessitated
the
explosion
the
explosion
necessitated
my
sudden
fright
which
necessitated
my
sudden
jump
which
from
a
necessity
equally
powerful
was
in
a
curvilinear
ascent
the
descent
being
in
a
corresponding
curve
and
commencing
at
a
point
perpendicular
to
the
extreme
line
of
the
edge
of
the
tower
i
was
by
the
necessity
of
gravitation
attracted
first
through
the
ivy
and
secondly
through
the
hazel
and
thirdly
through
the
ash
into
the
water
beneath
the
motive
or
impulse
thus
adhibited
in
the
person
of
a
drowning
man
was
as
powerful
on
his
material
compages
as
the
force
of
gravitation
on
mine
and
he
could
no
more
help
jumping
into
the
water
than
i
could
help
falling
into
it
all
perfectly
true
said
squire
headlong
and
on
the
same
principle
you
make
no
distinction
between
the
man
who
knocks
you
down
and
him
who
picks
you
up
i
make
this
distinction
said
mr
cranium
that
i
avoid
the
former
as
a
machine
containing
a
peculiar
quality
which
i
have
found
to
be
not
consentaneous
to
my
mode
of
pleasurable
existence
but
i
attach
no
moral
merit
or
demerit
to
either
of
them
as
these
terms
are
usually
employed
seeing
that
they
are
equally
creatures
of
necessity
and
must
act
as
they
do
from
the
nature
of
their
organisation
i
no
more
blame
or
praise
a
man
for
what
is
called
vice
or
virtue
than
i
tax
a
tuft
of
hemlock
with
malevolence
or
discover
great
philanthropy
in
a
field
of
potatoes
seeing
that
the
men
and
the
plants
are
equally
incapacitated
by
their
original
internal
organisation
and
the
combinations
and
modifications
of
external
circumstances
from
being
any
thing
but
what
they
are
victus
fateare
necesse
yet
you
destroy
the
hemlock
said
squire
headlong
and
cultivate
the
potato
that
is
my
way
at
least
i
do
said
mr
cranium
because
i
know
that
the
farinaceous
qualities
of
the
potato
will
tend
to
preserve
the
great
requisites
of
unity
and
coalescence
in
the
various
constituent
portions
of
my
animal
republic
and
that
the
hemlock
if
gathered
by
mistake
for
parsley
chopped
up
small
with
butter
and
eaten
with
a
boiled
chicken
would
necessitate
a
great
derangement
and
perhaps
a
total
decomposition
of
my
corporeal
mechanism
very
well
said
the
squire
then
you
are
necessitated
to
like
mr
escot
better
than
mr
panscope
that
is
a
said
mr
cranium
then
this
is
a
said
the
squire
your
daughter
and
mr
escot
are
necessitated
to
love
one
another
and
unless
you
feel
necessitated
to
adhibit
your
consent
they
will
feel
necessitated
to
dispense
with
it
since
it
does
appear
to
moral
and
political
economists
to
be
essentially
inherent
in
the
eternal
fitness
of
things
mr
cranium
fell
into
a
profound
reverie
emerging
from
which
he
said
looking
squire
headlong
full
in
the
face
do
you
think
mr
escot
would
give
me
that
skull
skull
said
squire
headlong
yes
said
mr
cranium
the
skull
of
cadwallader
to
be
sure
he
will
said
the
squire
ascertain
the
point
said
mr
cranium
how
can
you
doubt
it
said
the
squire
i
simply
know
said
mr
cranium
that
if
it
were
once
in
my
possession
i
would
not
part
with
it
for
any
acquisition
on
earth
much
less
for
a
wife
i
have
had
one
and
as
marriage
has
been
compared
to
a
pill
i
can
very
safely
assert
that
is
a
and
my
reason
for
thinking
that
he
will
not
part
with
it
is
that
its
extraordinary
magnitude
tends
to
support
his
system
as
much
as
its
very
marked
protuberances
tend
to
support
mine
and
you
know
his
own
system
is
of
all
things
the
dearest
to
every
man
of
liberal
thinking
and
a
philosophical
tendency
the
squire
flew
over
to
mr
escot
i
told
you
said
he
i
would
settle
him
but
there
is
a
very
hard
condition
attached
to
his
compliance
i
submit
to
it
said
mr
escot
be
it
what
it
may
nothing
less
said
squire
headlong
than
the
absolute
and
unconditional
surrender
of
the
skull
of
cadwallader
i
resign
it
said
mr
escot
the
skull
is
yours
said
the
squire
skipping
over
to
mr
cranium
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
said
mr
cranium
the
lady
is
yours
said
the
squire
skipping
back
to
mr
escot
i
am
the
happiest
man
alive
said
mr
escot
come
said
the
squire
then
there
is
an
amelioration
in
the
state
of
the
sensitive
man
a
slight
oscillation
of
good
in
the
instance
of
a
solitary
individual
answered
mr
escot
by
no
means
affects
the
solidity
of
my
opinions
concerning
the
general
deterioration
of
the
civilised
world
which
when
i
can
be
induced
to
contemplate
with
feelings
of
satisfaction
i
doubt
not
but
that
i
may
be
persuaded
be
in
love
with
tortures
and
to
think
charitably
of
the
saying
these
words
he
flew
off
as
nimbly
as
squire
headlong
himself
to
impart
the
happy
intelligence
to
his
beautiful
cephalis
mr
cranium
now
walked
up
to
mr
panscope
to
condole
with
him
on
the
disappointment
of
their
mutual
hopes
mr
panscope
begged
him
not
to
distress
himself
on
the
subject
observing
that
the
monotonous
system
of
female
education
brought
every
individual
of
the
sex
to
so
remarkable
an
approximation
of
similarity
that
no
wise
man
would
suffer
himself
to
be
annoyed
by
a
loss
so
easily
repaired
and
that
there
was
much
truth
though
not
much
elegance
in
a
remark
which
he
had
heard
made
on
a
similar
occasion
by
a
of
his
acquaintance
that
there
never
was
a
fish
taken
out
of
the
sea
but
left
another
as
good
behind
mr
cranium
replied
that
no
two
individuals
having
all
the
organs
of
the
skull
similarly
developed
the
universal
resemblance
of
which
mr
panscope
had
spoken
could
not
possibly
exist
mr
panscope
rejoined
and
a
long
discussion
ensued
concerning
the
comparative
influence
of
natural
organisation
and
artificial
education
in
which
the
beautiful
cephalis
was
totally
lost
sight
of
and
which
ended
as
most
controversies
do
by
each
party
continuing
firm
in
his
own
opinion
and
professing
his
profound
astonishment
at
the
blindness
and
prejudices
of
the
other
in
the
meanwhile
a
great
confusion
had
arisen
at
the
outer
doors
the
departure
of
the
being
impeded
by
a
circumstance
which
the
experience
of
ages
had
discovered
no
means
to
obviate
the
grooms
coachmen
and
postillions
were
all
drunk
it
was
proposed
that
the
gentlemen
should
officiate
in
their
places
but
the
gentlemen
were
almost
all
in
the
same
condition
this
was
a
fearful
dilemma
but
a
very
diligent
investigation
brought
to
light
a
few
servants
and
a
few
gentlemen
not
above
and
by
an
equitable
distribution
of
these
rarities
the
greater
part
of
the
guests
were
enabled
to
set
forward
with
very
nearly
an
even
chance
of
not
having
their
necks
broken
before
they
reached
home
chapter
xv
the
conclusion
the
squire
and
his
select
party
of
philosophers
and
dilettanti
were
again
left
in
peaceful
possession
of
headlong
hall
and
as
the
former
made
a
point
of
never
losing
a
moment
in
the
accomplishment
of
a
favourite
object
he
did
not
suffer
many
days
to
elapse
before
the
spiritual
metamorphosis
of
eight
into
four
was
effected
by
the
clerical
dexterity
of
the
reverend
doctor
gaster
immediately
after
the
ceremony
the
whole
party
dispersed
the
squire
having
first
extracted
from
every
one
of
his
chosen
guests
a
positive
promise
to
in
august
when
they
would
be
better
enabled
in
its
most
appropriate
season
to
form
a
correct
judgment
of
cambrian
hospitality
mr
jenkison
shook
hands
at
parting
with
his
two
brother
philosophers
according
to
your
respective
systems
said
he
i
ought
to
congratulate
on
a
change
for
the
better
which
i
do
most
cordially
and
to
condole
with
on
a
change
for
the
worse
though
when
i
consider
whom
you
have
chosen
i
should
violate
every
principle
of
probability
in
doing
so
you
will
do
well
said
mr
foster
to
follow
our
example
the
extensive
circle
of
general
philanthropy
which
in
the
present
advanced
stage
of
human
nature
comprehends
in
its
circumference
the
destinies
of
the
whole
species
originated
and
still
proceeds
from
that
narrower
circle
of
domestic
affection
which
first
set
limits
to
the
empire
of
selfishness
and
by
purifying
the
passions
and
enlarging
the
affections
of
mankind
has
given
to
the
views
of
benevolence
an
increasing
and
illimitable
expansion
which
will
finally
diffuse
happiness
and
peace
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
world
the
affection
said
mr
escot
of
two
congenial
spirits
united
not
by
legal
bondage
and
superstitious
imposture
but
by
mutual
confidence
and
reciprocal
virtues
is
the
only
counterbalancing
consolation
in
this
scene
of
mischief
and
misery
but
how
rarely
is
this
the
case
according
to
the
present
system
of
marriage
so
far
from
being
a
central
point
of
expansion
to
the
great
circle
of
universal
benevolence
it
serves

for
the

youthful
philanthropy
the

at

years
and
what
accession
of
individual
happiness
is
acquired
by
this
oblivion
of
the
general
good
luxury
despotism
and
avarice
have
so
seized
and
entangled
nine
hundred
and
out
of
every
thousand
of
the
human
race
that
the
matrimonial
compact
which
ought
to
be
the
most
easy
the
most
free
and
the
most
simple
of
all
engagements
is
become
the
most
slavish
and
complicated
a
mere
question
of
finance
a
system
of
bargain
and
barter
and
commerce
and
trick
and
chicanery
and
dissimulation
and
fraud
is
there
one
instance
in
ten
thousand
in
which
the
buds
of
first
affection
are
not
most
cruelly
and
hopelessly
blasted
by
avarice
or
ambition
or
arbitrary
power
females
condemned
during
the
whole
flower
of
their
youth
to
a
worse
than
monastic
celibacy
irrevocably
debarred
from
the
hope
to
which
their
first
affections
pointed
will
at
a
certain
period
of
life
as
the
natural
delicacy
of
taste
and
feeling
is
gradually
worn
away
by
the
attrition
of
society
become
willing
to
take
up
with
any
coxcomb
or
scoundrel
whom
that
merciless
and
mercenary
gang
of
slaves
and
assassins
called
in
the
ordinary
prostitution
of
language
may
agree
in
designating
as
a
young
men
on
the
other
hand
are
driven
by
the
same
vile
superstitions
from
the
company
of
the
most
amiable
and
modest
of
the
opposite
sex
to
that
of
those
miserable
victims
and
outcasts
of
a
world
which
dares
to
call
itself
virtuous
whom
that
very
society
whose
pernicious
institutions
first
caused
their
aberrations
consigning
them
without
one
tear
of
pity
or
one
struggle
of
remorse
to
penury
infamy
and
disease
condemns
to
bear
the
burden
of
its
own
atrocious
absurdities
thus
the
youth
of
one
sex
is
consumed
in
slavery
disappointment
and
spleen
that
of
the
other
in
frantic
folly
and
selfish
intemperance
till
at
length
on
the
necks
of
a
couple
so
enfeebled
so
perverted
so
distempered
both
in
body
and
soul
society
throws
the
yoke
of
marriage
that
yoke
which
once
rivetted
on
the
necks
of
its
victims
clings
to
them
like
the
poisoned
garments
of
nessus
or
medea
what
can
be
expected
from
these
but
that
like
two
hounds
coupled
by
a
tyrannical
sportsman
they
should
drag
on
their
indissoluble
fetter
snarling
and
growling
and
pulling
in
different
directions
what
can
be
expected
for
their
wretched
offspring
but
sickness
and
suffering
premature
decrepitude
and
untimely
death
in
this
as
in
every
other
institution
of
civilised
society
avarice
luxury
and
disease
constitute
the
triangular
harmony
of
the
life
of
man
avarice
conducts
him
to
the
abyss
of
toil
and
crime
luxury
seizes
on
his
spoil
and
while
he
revels
in
her
enchantments
or
groans
beneath
her
tyranny
disease
bursts

him

mr
