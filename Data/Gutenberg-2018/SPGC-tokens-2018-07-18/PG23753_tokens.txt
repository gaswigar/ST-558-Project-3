of
john
gilpin
john

was
a
citizen
of
credit
and
renown
a
captain
eke
was
he
of
famous
london
town
john
gilpin
spouse
said
to
her

these
twice
ten
tedious
years
yet

and
we
will
then
repair
unto
the
bell
at
edmonton
all
in
a
chaise
and
pair
my
sister
and
my
sister
child
myself
and
children
three
will
fill
the
chaise
so
you
must
ride
on
horseback
after
we
he
soon
replied
i
do
admire
of
womankind
but
one
and
you
are
she
my
dearest
dear
therefore
it
shall
be
done
i
am
a
linendraper
bold
as
all
the
world
doth
know
and
my
good
friend
the
calender
will
lend
his
horse
to
go
quoth
gilpin
that
well
said
and
for
that
wine
is
dear
we
will
be
furnish
with
our
own
which
is
both
bright
and
clear
john
gilpin
kiss
his
loving
wife
was
he
to
find
that
though
on
pleasure
she
was
bent
she
had
a
frugal
mind
the
morning
came
the
chaise
was
brought
but
yet
was
not
to
drive
up
to
the
door
lest
all
should
say
that
she
was
proud
so
three
doors
off
the
chaise
was
stay
where
they
did
all
get
in
six
precious
souls
and
all
agog
to
dash
through
thick
and
thin
smack
went
the
whip
round
went
the
wheels
were
never
folks
so
glad
the
stones
did
rattle
underneath
as
if
cheapside
were
mad
illustration
john
gilpin
at
his
horse
side
seized
last
the
flowing
mane
and
up
he
got
in
haste
to
ride
but
soon
came
down
again
for
scarce
reach
had
he
his
journey
to
begin
when
turning
round
his
head
he
saw
three
customers
come
in
so
down
he
came
for
loss
of
time
although
it
grieved
him
sore
yet
loss
of
pence
full
well
he
knew
would
trouble
him
much
more
was
long
before
the
customers
were
suited
to
their
mind
when
betty
screaming
came
down
stairs
the
wine
is
left
behind
good
lack
quoth
he
yet
bring
it
me
my
leathern
belt
likewise
in
which
i
bear
my
trusty
sword
when
i
do
exercise
now
gilpin
careful
soul
had
two
stone
bottles
found
to
hold
the
liquor
that
she
loved
and
keep
it
safe
and
sound
each
bottle
had
a
curling
ear
through
which
the
belt
he
drew
and
hung
a
bottle
on
each
side
to
make
his
balance
true
then
over
all
that
he
might
be
equipp
from
top
to
toe
his
long
red
cloak
well
brush
and
neat
he
manfully
did
throw
now
see
him
mounted
once
again
upon
his
nimble
steed
full
slowly
pacing
the
stones
with
caution
and
good
heed
but
finding
soon
another
road
beneath
his
feet
the
snorting
boast
began
to
trot
which
gall
him
in
his
seat
so
fair
and
softly
john
he
cried
but
john
he
cried
in
vain
that
trot
became
a
gallop
soon
in
spite
of
curb
and
rein
so
stooping
down
as
needs
he
must
who
can
not
sit
upright
he
grasp
the
mane
with
both
his
hands
and
eke
with
all
his
might
his
horse
who
never
in
that
sort
had
handled
been
before
what
thing
upon
his
back
had
got
did
wonder
more
and
more
away
went
gilpin
neck
or
nought
away
went
hat
and
wig
he
little
dreamt
when
he
set
out
of
running
such
a
rig
illustration
the
wind
did
blow
the
cloak
did
fly
like
streamer
long
and
gay
till
loop
and
button
failing
both
at
last
it
flew
away
then
might
all
people
well
discern
the
bottles
he
had
slung
a
bottle
swinging
at
each
side
as
has
been
said
or
sung
the
dogs
did
bark
the
children
scream
up
flew
the
windows
all
and
every
soul
cried
out
well
done
as
loud
as
he
could
bawl
away
went
gilpin
who
but
he
his
fame
soon
spread
around
he
carries
weight
he
rides
a
race
is
for
a
thousand
pound
and
still
as
fast
as
he
drew
near
was
wonderful
to
view
how
in
a
trice
the
their
gates
wide
open
threw
and
now
as
he
went
bowing
down
his
reeking
head
full
low
the
bottles
twain
behind
his
back
were
shattered
at
a
blow
down
ran
the
wine
into
the
road
most
piteous
to
be
seen
which
made
his
horse
flanks
to
smoke
as
they
had
basted
been
but
still
he
seem
to
carry
weight
with
leathern
girdle
braced
for
all
might
see
the
bottle
necks
still
dangling
at
his
waist
thus
all
through
merry
islington
these
gambols
he
did
play
until
he
came
unto
the
wash
of
edmonton
so
gay
and
there
he
threw
the
wash
about
on
both
sides
of
the
way
just
like
unto
a
trundling
mop
or
a
wild
goose
at
play
at
edmonton
his
loving
wife
from
the
balcony
spied
her
tender
husband
wondering
much
to
see
how
he
did
ride
stop
stop
john
gilpin
here
the
house
they
all
at
once
did
cry
the
dinner
waits
and
we
are
tired
said
gilpin
so
am
i
but
yet
his
horse
was
not
a
whit
inclined
to
tarry
there
for
why
his
owner
had
a
house
full
ten
miles
off
at
ware
so
like
an
arrow
swift
he
flew
shot
by
an
archer
strong
so
did
he
fly
which
brings
me
to
the
middle
of
my
song
illustration
away
went
gilpin
out
of
breath
and
sore
against
his
will
till
at
his
friend
the
his
horse
at
last
stood
still
the
calender
amazed
to
see
his
neighbour
in
such
trim
laid
down
his
pipe
flew
to
the
gate
and
thus
accosted
him
what
news
what
news
your
tidings
tell
tell
me
you
must
and
shall
say
why
bareheaded
you
are
come
or
why
you
come
at
all
now
gilpin
had
a
pleasant
wit
and
loved
a
timely
joke
and
thus
unto
the
calender
in
merry
guise
he
spoke
i
came
because
your
horse
would
come
and
if
i
well
forebode
my
hat
and
wig
will
soon
be
here
they
are
upon
the
road
the
calender
right
glad
to
find
his
friend
in
merry
pin
return
him
not
a
single
word
but
to
the
house
went
in
thence
straight
he
came
with
hat
and
wig
a
wig
that
flow
behind
a
hat
not
much
the
worse
for
wear
each
comely
in
its
kind
he
held
them
up
and
in
his
turn
thus
show
his
ready
wit
my
head
is
twice
as
big
as
yours
they
therefore
needs
must
fit
but
let
me
scrape
the
dirt
away
that
hangs
upon
your
face
and
stop
and
eat
for
well
you
may
be
in
a
hungry
case
said
john
it
is
my
and
all
the
world
would
stare
if
wife
should
dine
at
edmonton
and
i
should
dine
at
ware
so
turning
to
his
horse
he
said
i
am
in
haste
to
dine
was
for
your
pleasure
you
came
here
you
shall
go
back
for
mine
ah
luckless
speech
and
bootless
boast
for
which
he
paid
full
dear
for
while
he
spake
a
braying
ass
did
sing
most
loud
and
clear
whereat
his
horse
did
snort
as
he
had
heard
a
lion
roar
and
gallop
off
with
all
his
might
as
he
had
done
before
away
went
gilpin
and
away
went
gilpin
hat
and
wig
he
lost
them
sooner
than
at
first
for
why
they
were
too
big
illustration
now
gilpin
when
she
saw
her
husband
posting
down
into
the
country
far
away
she
pull
out
and
thus
unto
the
youth
she
said
that
drove
them
to
the
bell
this
shall
be
yours
when
you
bring
back
my
husband
safe
and
well
the
youth
did
ride
and
soon
did
meet
john
coming
back
amain
whom
in
a
trice
he
tried
to
stop
by
catching
at
his
rein
but
not
performing
what
he
meant
and
gladly
would
have
done
the
frighted
steed
he
frighted
more
and
made
him
faster
run
away
went
gilpin
and
away
went
at
his
heels
the
horse
right
glad
to
miss
the
lumbering
of
the
wheels
six
gentlemen
upon
the
road
thus
seeing
gilpin
fly
with
scampering
in
the
rear
they
raised
the
hue
and
cry
stop
thief
stop
thief
a
highwayman
not
one
of
them
was
mute
and
all
and
each
that
pass
that
way
did
join
in
the
pursuit
and
now
the
turnpike
gates
again
flew
open
in
short
space
the
thinking
as
before
that
gilpin
rode
a
race
and
so
he
did
and
won
it
too
for
he
got
first
to
town
nor
stopp
till
where
he
had
got
up
he
did
again
get
down
now
let
us
sing
long
live
the
king
and
gilpin
long
live
he
and
when
he
next
doth
ride
abroad
may
i
be
there
to
see
london
