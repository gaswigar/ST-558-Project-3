that
was
that

was
no

they
was
too
much
together
thim
two
behind

i
shifted
an
some
av
what

hild
the
smartest
man
in

so
fwhat
he
said
an
said
was
a
mortial
truth
we
knew
that
the
was
bad
but
for
reasons
which
i
have
already
oblitherated
i
knew
more
than

tried
to

in
the
fort
ditch
said
mulvaney
finishing
the
champagne
a
shuparfluous
observation
of
those
called
footnote
we
were
wallowing
through
the
china
seas
in
a
dense
fog
the
horn
blowing
every
two
minutes
for
the
benefit
of
the
fishery
craft
that
crowded
the
waterways
from
the
bridge
the
was
invisible
from
the
at
the
stern
the
captain
cabin
the
fog
held
possession
of
everything
the
pearly
white
fog
once
or
twice
when
it
tried
to
lift
we
saw
a
glimpse
of
the
oily
sea
the
flitting
vision
of
a
sail
spread
in
the
vain
hope
of
catching
the
breeze
or
the
buoys
of
a
line
of
nets
somewhere
close
to
us
lay
the
land
but
it
might
have
been
the
kurile
islands
for
aught
we
knew
very
early
in
the
morning
there
passed
us
not
a
away
but
as
unseen
as
the
spirits
of
the
dead
a
steamer
of
the
same
line
as
ours
she
howled
melodiously
in
answer
to
our
bellowing
and
passed
on
she
had
hit
us
said
a
man
from
saigon
we
should
have
gone
down
answered
the
chief
officer
sweetly
thing
to
go
down
in
a
fog
said
a
young
gentleman
who
was
travelling
for
pleasure
a
man
both
ways
y
know
we
were
comfortably
gathered
in
the
the
weather
being
too
cold
to
venture
on
the
deck
conversation
naturally
turned
upon
accidents
of
fog
the
horn
tooting
significantly
in
the
pauses
between
the
tales
i
heard
of
the
wreck
of
the
the
cutting
down
of
the
within
half
a
mile
of
harbour
and
the
carrying
away
of
the
bow
plates
of
the
outside
sandy
hook
is
astonishing
said
the
man
from
saigon
many
true
stories
are
put
down
as
sea
yarns
it
makes
a
man
almost
shrink
from
telling
an
anecdote
please
do
shrink
on
our
account
said
the
with
one
voice
not
my
own
story
said
the
man
from
saigon
fellow
on
a
massageries
boat
told
it
me
he
had
been
third
officer
of
a
sort
on
a
geordie
tramp
one
of
those
lumbering
where
the
machinery
is
tied
up
with
a
string
and
the
plates
are
rivetted
with
putty
the
way
he
told
his
tale
was
this
the
tramp
had
been
creeping
along
some
sea
or
other
with
a
chart
ten
years
old
and
the
haziest
sort
of
chronometers
when
she
got
into
a
fog
just
such
a
fog
as
we
have
now
here
the
turned
round
as
one
man
and
looked
through
the
windows
the
man
own
words
just
when
the
fog
was
thickest
the
engines
broke
down
they
had
been
doing
this
for
some
weeks
and
we
were
too
weary
to
care
i
went
forward
of
the
bridge
and
leaned
over
the
side
wondering
where
i
should
ever
get
something
that
i
could
call
a
ship
and
whether
the
old
hulk
would
fall
to
pieces
as
she
lay
the
fog
was
as
thick
as
any
london
one
but
as
white
as
steam
while
they
were
tinkering
at
the
engines
below
i
heard
a
voice
in
the
fog
about
twenty
yards
from
the
ship
side
calling
out
you
climb
on
board
if
we
throw
you
a
rope
that
startled
me
because
i
fancied
we
were
going
to
be
run
down
the
next
minute
by
a
ship
engaged
in
rescuing
a
man
overboard
i
shouted
for
the
whistle
and
it
whistled
about
five
minutes
but
never
the
sound
of
a
ship
could
we
hear
the
boy
came
forward
with
some
biscuit
for
me
as
he
put
it
into
my
hand
i
heard
the
voice
in
the
fog
crying
out
about
throwing
us
a
rope
this
time
it
was
the
boy
that
yelled
on
us
and
off
went
the
whistle
again
while
the
men
in
the
it
generally
took
the
crew
to
repair
the
engines
tumbled
upon
deck
to
know
what
we
were
doing
i
told
them
about
the
hail
and
we
listened
in
the
smother
of
the
fog
for
the
sound
of
a
screw
we
listened
for
ten
minutes
then
we
blew
the
whistle
for
another
ten
then
the
crew
began
to
call
the
ship
boy
a
fool
meaning
that
the
third
mate
was
no
better
when
they
were
going
down
below
i
heard
the
hail
the
third
time
so
did
the
ship
boy
you
are
i
said
is
not
twenty
yards
from
us
the
engineer
sings
out
heard
it
too
are
you
all
asleep
then
the
crew
began
to
swear
at
the
engineer
and
what
with
discussion
argument
and
a
little
swearing
for
there
is
not
much
discipline
on
board
a
tramp
we
raised
such
a
row
that
our
skipper
came
aft
to
enquire
i
the
engineer
and
the
ship
boy
stuck
to
our
tale
or
no
voices
said
the
captain
better
patch
the
old
engines
up
and
see
if
you
got
enough
steam
to
whistle
with
i
a
notion
that
got
into
rather
too
crowded
the
engineer
stayed
on
deck
while
the
men
went
down
below
the
skipper
had
got
back
to
the
before
i
saw
thirty
feet
of
bowsprit
hanging
over
the
break
of
the
thirty
feet
of
bowsprit
sir
does
belong
to
anything
that
sails
the
seas
except
a
or
a
i
speculated
quite
a
long
time
with
my
hands
on
the
bulwarks
as
to
whether
our
friend
was
soft
wood
or
steel
plated
it
would
not
have
made
much
difference
to
us
anyway
but
i
felt
there
was
more
honour
in
being
rammed
you
know
then
i
knew
all
about
it
it
was
a
ram
we
opened
out
i
am
not
exaggerating
we
opened
out
sir
like
a
cardboard
box
the
other
ship
cut
us
through
a
little
behind
the
break
of
the
our
decks
split
up
lengthways
the
bounded
out
of
its
place
and
we
heeled
over
then
the
other
ship
blew
a
i
remember
thinking
as
i
took
water
from
the
port
bulwark
that
this
was
rather
ostentatious
after
she
had
done
all
the
mischief
after
that
i
was
a
mile
and
a
half
under
sea
trying
to
go
to
sleep
as
hard
as
i
could
some
one
caught
hold
of
my
hair
and
waked
me
up
i
was
hanging
to
what
was
left
of
one
of
our
boats
under
the
lee
of
a
large
english
ironclad
there
were
two
men
with
me
the
three
of
us
began
to
yell
a
man
on
the
ship
sings
out
you
climb
on
board
if
we
throw
you
a
rope
they
were
going
to
let
down
a
fine
new
boat
to
pick
up
three
rats
we
accepted
the
invitation
we
climbed
i
the
engineer
and
the
ship
boy
about
half
an
hour
later
the
fog
cleared
entirely
except
for
the
half
of
the
boat
away
in
the
offing
there
was
neither
stick
nor
string
on
the
sea
to
show
that
the
had
been
cut
what
do
you
think
of
that
now
said
the
man
from
saigon
private
learoyd
story
and
he
told
a
of
gautama
far
from
the
haunts
of
company
officers
who
insist
upon
far
from
sergeants
who
sniff
the
pipe
stuffed
into
the
two
miles
from
the
tumult
of
the
barracks
lies
the
trap
it
is
an
old
dry
well
shadowed
by
a
twisted
tree
and
fenced
with
high
grass
here
in
the
years
gone
by
did
private
ortheris
establish
his
depot
and
menagerie
for
such
possessions
dead
and
living
as
could
not
safely
be
introduced
to
the
here
were
gathered
houdin
pullets
and
of
undoubted
pedigree
and
more
than
doubtful
ownership
for
ortheris
was
an
inveterate
poacher
and
among
a
regiment
of
never
again
will
the
long
lazy
evenings
return
wherein
ortheris
whistling
softly
moved
among
the
captives
of
his
craft
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
when
learoyd
sat
in
the
niche
giving
sage
counsel
on
the
management
of
and
mulvaney
from
the
crook
of
the
overhanging
waved
his
enormous
boots
in
benediction
above
our
heads
delighting
us
with
tales
of
love
and
war
and
strange
experiences
of
cities
and
men
ortheris
landed
at
last
in
the
stuff
for
which
your
soul
longed
learoyd
back
again
in
the
smoky
north
amid
the
clang
of
the
bradford
looms
mulvaney
grizzled
tender
and
very
wise
ulysses
sweltering
on
the
earthwork
of
a
central
india
line
judge
if
i
have
forgotten
old
days
in
the
trap

foaks
said
she
was
a
real
laady

nobbut
a
hewrasian
i
do
gainsay
as
her
culler
was
a
bit
doosky
like
but
she
a
laady
why
she
rode
iv
a
carriage
an
good
too
an
her
was
that
oiled
as
you
could
see
your
faice

an
she
wore
dimond
rings
an
a
goold
chain
silk
an
satin
dresses
as
mun
cost
a
deal
for
it
is
a
cheap

enough
o
one
pattern
to
fit
a
figure
like
hers
her
name
was
desussa
a
waay
i
coom
to
be
acquainted
wi
her
was
along
of
our
colonel
laady
dog
rip
i
seen
a
vast
o
dogs
but
rip
was
t
prettiest
picter
of
a
cliver
iver
i
set
eyes
on
he
could
do
owt
you
like
but
speeak
an
t
colonel
laady
set
more
store
by
him
than
if
he
hed
been
a
christian
she
hed
bairns
of
her

but
they
was
i
england
and
rip
seemed
to
get
all
t
coodlin
and
pettin

by
good
right
but
rip
were
a
bit
on

habit
o
breakin

cantonment
magistrate
coom
round
inspectin
the

on
a
bit
as
a
time
expired
an
awful
thing
has
happened
my
friend
private
mulvaney
who
went
home
in
the
not
very
long
ago
has
come
back
to
india
as
a
civilian
it
was
all
dinah
shadd
fault
she
could
not
stand
the
poky
little
lodgings
and
she
missed
her
servant
abdullah
more
than
words
could
tell
the
fact
was
that
the
mulvaneys
had
been
out
here
too
long
and
had
lost
touch
of
england
mulvaney
knew
a
contractor
on
one
of
the
new
central
india
lines
and
wrote
to
him
for
some
sort
of
work
the
contractor
said
that
if
mulvaney
could
pay
the
passage
he
would
give
him
command
of
a
gang
of
coolies
for
old
sake
sake
the
pay
was
rupees
a
month
and
dinah
shadd
said
that
if
terence
did
not
accept
she
would
make
his
life
a
purgathory
therefore
the
mulvaneys
came
out
as
which
was
a
great
and
terrible
fall
though
mulvaney
tried
to
disguise
it
by
saying
that
he
was
on
the
railway
line
an
a
consequinshal
man
he
wrote
me
an
invitation
on
a
form
to
visit
him
and
i
came
down
to
the
funny
little
bungalow
at
the
side
of
the
line
dinah
shadd
had
planted
peas
about
and
about
and
nature
had
spread
all
manner
of
green
stuff
round
the
place
there
was
no
change
in
mulvaney
except
the
change
of
clothing
which
was
deplorable
but
could
not
be
helped
he
was
standing
upon
his
trolly
haranguing
a
gangman
and
his
shoulders
were
as
well
drilled
and
his
big
thick
chin
was
as
as
ever
a
civilian
now
said
mulvaney

deep
the
lady
passengers
were
trying
the
wheezy
old
harmonium
in
front
of
the
cuddy
because
it
was
sunday
night
in
the
patch
of
darkness
near
the
sat
the
captain
and
the
end
of
his
cheroot
burned
like
a
there
was
neither
breath
nor
motion
upon
the
waters
through
which
the
screw
was
thudding
they
spread
dull
silver
under
the
haze
of
the
moonlight
till
they
joined
the
low
coast
of
malacca
away
to
the
eastward
the
voices
of
the
singers
at
the
harmonium
were
held
down
by
the
awnings
and
came
to
us
with
force
hear
us
when
we
cry
to
thee
for
those
in
peril
on
the
sea
it
was
as
though
the
little
congregation
were
afraid
of
the
vastness
of
the
sea
but
a
laugh
followed
and
some
one
said
we
take
it
through
again
a
little
quicker
then
the
captain
told
the
story
of
just
such
a
night
lowering
his
voice
for
fear
of
disturbing
the
music
and
the
minds
of
the
passengers
was
the
five
hundred
tons
or
it
may
have
been
six
in
the
coasting
trade
one
of
the
best
steamers
and
best
found
on
the
line
she
was
six
years
old
when
the
thing
happened
on
just
such
a
night
as
this
with
an
oily
smooth
sea
under
brilliant
starlight
about
a
hundred
miles
from
land
to
this
day
no
one
knows
really
what
the
matter
was
she
was
so
small
that
she
could
not
have
struck
even
a
log
in
the
water
without
every
soul
on
board
feeling
the
jar
and
even
if
she
had
struck
something
it
would
have
made
her
go
down
as
she
did
i
was
fourth
officer
then
we
had
about
seven
saloon
passengers
including
the
captain
wife
and
another
woman
and
perhaps
five
hundred
going
up
the
coast
to
a
shrine
on
just
such
a
night
as
this
when
she
was
ripping
through
the
level
sea
at
a
level
nine
knots
an
hour
the
man
on
the
bridge
whoever
it
was
saw
that
she
was
sinking
at
the
head
sinking
by
the
head
as
she
went
along
that
was
the
only
warning
we
got
she
began
to
sink
as
she
went
along
of
course
the
captain
was
told
and
he
sent
me
to
wake
up
the
saloon
passengers
and
tell
them
to
come
on
deck
a
curious
sort
of
message
that
to
deliver
on
a
dead
still
night
the
people
tumbled
up
in
their
and
and
would
believe
me
we
were
just
sinking
as
fast
as
we
could
and
i
had
to
tell
that
then
the
got
wind
of
it
and
all
hell
woke
up
along
the
decks
rule
in
these
little
affairs
is
to
get
your
saloon
passengers
off
first
then
to
fill
the
boats
with
the
balance
and
afterwards
god
help
the
extras
that
all
i
was
getting
the
starboard
stern
boat
the
away
it
hung
as
it
might
be
over
yonder
and
as
i
came
along
from
the
cuddy
the
hung
round
me
shoving
their
into
my
hand
taking
off
their
and
earrings
and
thrusting
upon
me
to
buy
just
one
chance
for
life
if
i
had
been
so
desperately
busy
i
should
have
thought
it
horrible
i
put
biscuits
and
water
into
the
boat
and
got
the
two
ladies
in
one
of
was
the
captain
wife
she
had
to
be
put
in
by
main
force
you
no
notion
how
women
can
struggle
the
other
woman
was
the
wife
of
an
officer
going
to
meet
her
husband
and
there
were
a
couple
of
passengers
beside
the
lascars
the
captain
said
he
was
going
to
stay
with
the
ship
you
see
the
rule
in
these
affairs
i
believe
is
that
the
captain
has
to
bow
gracefully
from
the
bridge
and
go
down
i
have
had
a
ship
under
my
charge
wrecked
yet
when
that
comes
i
have
to
do
like
the
others
after
the
boats
were
away
and
i
saw
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
by
waiting
i
jumped
overboard
exactly
as
i
might
have
vaulted
over
into
a
flat
green
field
and
struck
out
for
the
another
officer
did
the
same
thing
but
he
went
for
a
boat
full
of
natives
and
they
whacked
him
on
the
chest
with
oars
so
he
had
some
difficulty
in
climbing
in
was
as
well
that
i
reached
the
there
was
a
compass
in
it
but
the
idiots
had
managed
to
fill
the
boat
half
full
of
water
somehow
or
another
and
none
of
the
crew
seemed
to
know
what
was
required
of
them
then
the
went
down
and
took
every
one
with
her
ships
generally
do
that
the
corpses
do
cumber
the
sea
for
some
time
did
i
do
i
kept
all
the
boats
together
and
headed
into
the
track
of
the
coasting
steamers
the
aggravating
thing
was
the
thought
that
we
were
close
to
land
as
far
as
a
big
steamer
was
concerned
and
in
the
middle
of
eternity
as
far
as
regarded
a
little
boat
the
sea
looks
hugeous
big
from
a
boat
at
night
christ
whose
voice
the
waters
heard
and
hushed
their
ravings
at
thy
word
who
walkedst
on
the
foaming
deep
and
calm
amidst
its
rage
did
keep
oh
hear
us
when
we
cry
to
thee
for
those
in
peril
on
the
sea
sang
the
passengers
cheerily
harmonium
is
disgracefully
out
of
tune
said
the
captain
sea
air
affects
their
insides
well
as
i
was
saying
we
settled
down
in
the
boat
the
captain
wife
was
unconscious
she
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
moaned
i
was
glad
she
was
threshing
about
the
boat
but
what
i
did
think
was
wrong
was
the
way
the
two
men
passengers
behaved
they
were
useless
with
funk
out
and
out
fear
they
lay
in
the
boat
and
did
nothing
fetched
a
groan
now
and
again
to
show
they
were
alive
but
that
was
all
but
the
other
woman
was
a
jewel
damn
it
it
was
worth
being
shipwrecked
to
have
that
woman
in
the
boat
she
was
awfully
handsome
and
as
brave
as
she
was
lovely
she
helped
me
bail
out
the
boat
and
she
worked
like
a
man
we
kicked
about
the
sea
from
midnight
till
seven
the
next
evening
and
then
we
saw
a
steamer
i
i
give
you
anything
i
wearing
to
hoist
as
a
signal
of
distress
said
the
woman
but
i
had
no
need
to
ask
her
for
the
steamer
picked
us
up
and
took
us
back
to
bombay
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
when
the
day
broke
i
could
recognise
the
wife
widow
i
mean
she
had
changed
in
the
night
as
if
fire
had
gone
over
her
i
met
her
a
long
time
afterwards
and
even
then
she
forgiven
me
for
putting
her
into
the
boat
and
obeying
the
orders
but
the
husband
of
the
other
woman
he
in
the
army
wrote
me
no
end
of
a
letter
of
thanks
i
do
suppose
he
considered
that
the
way
his
wife
behaved
was
enough
to
make
any
decent
man
do
all
he
could
the
other
fellows
who
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
groaned
i
never
met
do
want
to
should
be
civil
to
if
i
did
and
that
how
the
went
down
for
no
assignable
reason
with
eighty
bags
of
mail
five
hundred
souls
and
not
a
single
packet
insured
on
just
such
a
night
as
this
trinity
of
love
and
power
our
brethren
shield
in
that
dread
hour
from
rock
and
tempest
fire
and
foe
protect
them
they
go
thus
evermore
shall
rise
to
thee
glad
hymns
of
praise
by
land
and
sea
me
they
go
on
singing
that
hymn
all
night
imperfect
sort
of
doctrine
in
the
last
lines
do
you
think
they
might
have
run
in
an
extra
verse
specifying
sudden
collapse
like
the
i
going
on
to
the
bridge
now
said
the
captain
and
i
was
left
alone
with
the
steady
thud
thud
of
the
screw
and
the
gentle
creaking
of
the
boats
at
the
davits
made
me
shudder
the
solid
muldoon
did
ye
see
john
malone
wid
his
shinin
hat
did
ye
see
how
he
walked
like
a
grand
aristocrat
there
was
flags
an
banners
wavin
high
an
dhress
and
shtyle
were
shown
but
the
best
av
all
the
company
was
misther
john
malone
there
had
been
a
royal
in
the
ravine
at
the
back
of
the
between
learoyd
and
ortheris
both
mongrel
rampur
hounds
chiefly
ribs
and
teeth
it
lasted
for
twenty
happy
howling
minutes
and
then
collapsed
and
ortheris
paid
learoyd
three
rupees
and
we
were
all
very
thirsty
a
is
a
most
heating
entertainment
quite
apart
from
the
shouting
because
rampurs
fight
over
a
couple
of
acres
of
ground
later
when
the
sound
of
clicking
against
the
necks
of
had
died
away
conversation
drifted
from
dog
to
of
all
kinds
humans
resemble
in
some
respects
any
talk
of
fighting
seems
to
wake
up
a
sort
of
imp
in
their
breasts
and
they
bell
one
to
the
other
exactly
like
challenging
bucks
this
is
noticeable
even
in
men
who
consider
themselves
superior
to
privates
of
the
line
it
shows
the
refining
influence
of
civilisation
and
the
march
of
progress
tale
provoked
tale
and
each
tale
more
beer
even
dreamy
learoyd
eyes
began
to
brighten
and
he
unburdened
himself
of
a
long
history
in
which
a
trip
to
malham
cove
a
girl
at
pateley
brigg
a
ganger
himself
and
a
pair
of

were
mixed

was

for

learoyd
pensively
mulvaney
came
out
of
a
reverie
he
was
lying
down
and
flourished
his
heels
in
the
air
a
man

said
he
critically

aftherwards
but
as
i
say
i
was
i
was
a
divil
of
a
man
he
was
silent
for
nearly
a
minute
while
his
mind
rummaged
among
old
memories
and
his
eye
glowed
he
bit
upon
the

charged
into

touched
the
grizzled
stubble
of

and
learoyd
followed
snapping
their

clear
as

with

obedience
of
the
soldier
child
but
ere
she
pattered
off
over
the
flagged
path
held
up
her
lips
to
be
kissed
by
the
three
musketeers
ortheris
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
swore
sentimentally
learoyd
turned
pink
and
the
two
walked
away
together
the
yorkshireman
lifted
up

piped
at

learoyd
bellowed
the

died
out
in
the
terence
i
said
dropping
into
mulvaney
speech
when
we
were
alone
you
that
have
the
tongue
he
looked
at
me
wearily
his
eyes
were
sunk
in
his
head
and
his
face
was
drawn
and
white
said
he
blandandhered
thim
through
the
night
somehow
but
can
thim
that

others
help

answer
me
that
sorr
and
over
the
bastions
of

amara
broke
the
pitiless
day
in
the
matter
of
a
private
hurrah
hurrah
a
soldier
life
for
me
shout
boys
shout
for
it
makes
you
jolly
and
free
ramrod
people
who
have
seen
say
that
one
of
the
quaintest
spectacles
of
human
frailty
is
an
outbreak
of
hysterics
in
a
girls
school
it
starts
without
warning
generally
on
a
hot
afternoon
among
the
elder
pupils
a
girl
giggles
till
the
giggle
gets
beyond
control
then
she
throws
up
her
head
and
cries
honk
honk
like
a
wild
goose
and
tears
mix
with
the
laughter
if
the
mistress
be
wise
she
will
rap
out
something
severe
at
this
point
to
check
matters
if
she
be
and
send
for
a
drink
of
water
the
chances
are
largely
in
favour
of
another
girl
laughing
at
the
afflicted
one
and
herself
collapsing
thus
the
trouble
spreads
and
may
end
in
half
of
what
answers
to
the
lower
sixth
of
a
boys
school
rocking
and
whooping
together
given
a
week
of
warm
weather
two
stately
promenades
per
diem
a
heavy
mutton
and
rice
meal
in
the
middle
of
the
day
a
certain
amount
of
nagging
from
the
teachers
and
a
few
other
things
some
amazing
effects
develop
at
least
this
is
what
folk
say
who
have
had
experience
now
the
mother
superior
of
a
convent
and
the
colonel
of
a
british
infantry
regiment
would
be
justly
shocked
at
any
comparison
being
made
between
their
respective
charges
but
it
is
a
fact
that
under
certain
circumstances
thomas
in
bulk
can
be
worked
up
into
ditthering
rippling
hysteria
he
does
not
weep
but
he
shows
his
trouble
unmistakably
and
the
consequences
get
into
the
newspapers
and
all
the
good
people
who
hardly
know
a
martini
from
a
snider
say
away
the
ammunition
thomas
is
a
brute
and
his
business
which
is
to
look
after
the
virtuous
people
demands
that
he
shall
have
his
ammunition
to
his
hand
he
does
wear
silk
stockings
and
he
really
ought
to
be
supplied
with
a
new
adjective
to
help
him
to
express
his
opinions
but
for
all
that
he
is
a
great
man
if
you
call
him
heroic
defender
of
the
national
honour
one
day
and
a
and
licentious
soldiery
the
next
you
naturally
bewilder
him
and
he
looks
upon
you
with
suspicion
there
is
nobody
to
speak
for
thomas
except
people
who
have
theories
to
work
off
on
him
and
nobody
understands
thomas
except
thomas
and
he
does
not
always
know
what
is
the
matter
with
himself
that
is
the
prologue
this
is
the
story
corporal
slane
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
miss
jhansi
whose
history
is
well
known
in
the
regiment
and
elsewhere
he
had
his
colonel
permission
and
being
popular
with
the
men
every
arrangement
had
been
made
to
give
the
wedding
what
private
ortheris
called
it
fell
in
the
heart
of
the
hot
weather
and
after
the
wedding
slane
was
going
up
to
the
hills
with
the
bride
none
the
less
grievance
was
that
the
affair
would
be
only
a
wedding
and
he
felt
that
the
of
that
was
meagre
miss
did
not
care
so
much
the
sergeant
wife
was
helping
her
to
make
her
and
she
was
very
busy
slane
was
just
then
the
only
moderately
contented
man
in
barracks
all
the
rest
were
more
or
less
miserable
and
they
had
so
much
to
make
them
happy
too
all
their
work
was
over
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
they
could
lie
on
their
backs
and
smoke
and
swear
at
the
they
enjoyed
a
fine
full
flesh
meal
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
then
threw
themselves
down
on
their
cots
and
sweated
and
slept
till
it
was
cool
enough
to
go
out
with
their
whose
vocabulary
contained
less
than
six
hundred
words
and
the
adjective
and
whose
views
on
every
conceivable
question
they
had
heard
many
times
before
there
was
the
canteen
of
course
and
there
was
the
temperance
room
with
the
papers
in
it
but
a
man
of
any
profession
can
not
read
for
eight
hours
a
day
in
a
temperature
of
degrees
or
degrees
in
the
shade
running
up
sometimes
to
degrees
at
midnight
very
few
men
even
though
they
get
a
pannikin
of
flat
stale
muddy
beer
and
hide
it
under
their
cots
can
continue
drinking
for
six
hours
a
day
one
man
tried
but
he
died
and
nearly
the
whole
regiment
went
to
his
funeral
because
it
gave
them
something
to
do
it
was
too
early
for
the
excitement
of
fever
or
cholera
the
men
could
only
wait
and
wait
and
wait
and
watch
the
shadow
of
the
barrack
creeping
across
the
blinding
white
dust
that
was
a
gay
life
they
lounged
about
cantonments
it
was
too
hot
for
any
sort
of
game
and
almost
too
hot
for
vice
and
fuddled
themselves
in
the
evening
and
filled
themselves
to
distension
with
the
healthy
nitrogenous
food
provided
for
them
and
the
more
they
stoked
the
less
exercise
they
took
and
more
explosive
they
grew
then
tempers
began
to
wear
away
and
men
fell
over
insults
real
or
imaginary
for
they
had
nothing
else
to
think
of
the
tone
of
the
repartees
changed
and
instead
of
saying
knock
your
silly
face
in
men
grew
laboriously
polite
and
hinted
that
the
cantonments
were
not
big
enough
for
themselves
and
their
enemy
and
that
there
would
be
more
space
for
one
of
the
two
in
another
place
it
may
have
been
the
devil
who
arranged
the
thing
but
the
fact
of
the
case
is
that
losson
had
for
a
long
time
been
worrying
simmons
in
an
aimless
way
it
gave
him
occupation
the
two
had
their
cots
side
by
side
and
would
sometimes
spend
a
long
afternoon
swearing
at
each
other
but
simmons
was
afraid
of
losson
and
dared
not
challenge
him
to
a
fight
he
thought
over
the
words
in
the
hot
still
nights
and
half
the
hate
he
felt
towards
losson
he
vented
on
the
wretched
losson
bought
a
parrot
in
the
bazar
and
put
it
into
a
little
cage
and
lowered
the
cage
into
the
cool
darkness
of
a
well
and
sat
on
the
shouting
bad
language
down
to
the
parrot
he
taught
it
to
say
ye
which
means
swine
and
several
other
things
entirely
unfit
for
publication
he
was
a
big
gross
man
and
he
shook
like
a
jelly
when
the
parrot
had
the
sentence
correctly
simmons
however
shook
with
rage
for
all
the
room
were
laughing
at
him
the
parrot
was
such
a
disreputable
puff
of
green
feathers
and
it
looked
so
human
when
it
chattered
losson
used
to
sit
swinging
his
fat
legs
on
the
side
of
the
cot
and
ask
the
parrot
what
it
thought
of
simmons
the
parrot
would
answer
ye
boy
losson
used
to
say
scratching
the
parrot
head
that
sim
and
simmons
used
to
turn
over
on
his
stomach
and
make
answer
take
do
something
one
of
these
days
in
the
restless
nights
after
he
had
been
asleep
all
day
fits
of
blind
rage
came
upon
simmons
and
held
him
till
he
trembled
all
over
while
he
thought
in
how
many
different
ways
he
would
slay
losson
sometimes
he
would
picture
himself
trampling
the
life
out
of
the
man
with
heavy
and
at
others
smashing
in
his
face
with
the
butt
and
at
others
jumping
on
his
shoulders
and
dragging
the
head
back
till
the
neckbone
cracked
then
his
mouth
would
feel
hot
and
fevered
and
he
would
reach
out
for
another
sup
of
the
beer
in
the
pannikin
but
the
fancy
that
came
to
him
most
frequently
and
stayed
with
him
longest
was
one
connected
with
the
great
roll
of
fat
under
right
ear
he
noticed
it
first
on
a
moonlight
night
and
thereafter
it
was
always
before
his
eyes
it
was
a
fascinating
roll
of
fat
a
man
could
get
his
hand
upon
it
and
tear
away
one
side
of
the
neck
or
he
could
place
the
muzzle
of
a
rifle
on
it
and
blow
away
all
the
head
in
a
flash
losson
had
no
right
to
be
sleek
and
contented
and
when
he
simmons
was
the
butt
of
the
room
some
day
perhaps
he
would
show
those
who
laughed
at
the
ye
joke
that
he
was
as
good
as
the
rest
and
held
a
man
life
in
the
crook
of
his
forefinger
when
losson
snored
simmons
hated
him
more
bitterly
than
ever
why
should
losson
be
able
to
sleep
when
simmons
had
to
stay
awake
hour
after
hour
tossing
and
turning
on
the
tapes
with
the
dull
liver
pain
gnawing
into
his
right
side
and
his
head
throbbing
and
aching
after
canteen
he
thought
over
this
for
many
many
nights
and
the
world
became
unprofitable
to
him
he
even
blunted
his
naturally
fine
appetite
with
beer
and
tobacco
and
all
the
while
the
parrot
talked
at
and
made
a
mock
of
him
the
heat
continued
and
the
tempers
wore
away
more
quickly
than
before
a
sergeant
wife
died
of
in
the
night
and
the
rumour
ran
abroad
that
it
was
cholera
men
rejoiced
openly
hoping
that
it
would
spread
and
send
them
into
camp
but
that
was
a
false
alarm
it
was
late
on
a
tuesday
evening
and
the
men
were
waiting
in
the
deep
double
verandas
for
posts
when
simmons
went
to
the
box
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
took
out
his
pipe
and
slammed
the
lid
down
with
a
bang
that
echoed
through
the
deserted
barrack
like
the
crack
of
a
rifle
ordinarily
speaking
the
men
would
have
taken
no
notice
but
their
nerves
were
fretted
to
they
jumped
up
and
three
or
four
clattered
into
the
only
to
find
simmons
kneeling
by
his
box
it
you
is
it
they
said
and
laughed
foolishly
thought
simmons
rose
slowly
if
the
accident
had
so
shaken
his
fellows
what
would
not
the
reality
do
thought
it
was
did
you
and
what
makes
you
think
he
said
lashing
himself
into
madness
as
he
went
on
hell
with
your
thinking
ye
dirty
spies
ye
chuckled
the
parrot
in
the
veranda
sleepily
recognising
a
voice
now
that
was
absolutely
all
the
tension
snapped
simmons
fell
back
on
the
deliberately
the
men
were
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
and
took
out
his
rifle
and
packet
of
ammunition
go
playing
the
goat
sim
said
losson
it
down
but
there
was
a
quaver
in
his
voice
another
man
stooped
slipped
his
boot
and
hurled
it
at
simmons
head
the
prompt
answer
was
a
shot
which
fired
at
random
found
its
billet
in
losson
throat
losson
fell
forward
without
a
word
and
the
others
scattered
thought
it
was
yelled
simmons
drivin
me
to
it
i
tell
you
you
drivin
me
to
it
get
up
losson
an
do
lie
there
you
an
your
blasted
parrit
that
druv
me
to
it
but
there
was
an
unaffected
reality
about
losson
pose
that
showed
simmons
what
he
had
done
the
men
were
still
clamouring
in
the
veranda
simmons
appropriated
two
more
packets
of
ammunition
and
ran
into
the
moonlight
muttering
make
a
night
of
it
thirty
roun
an
the
last
for
myself
take
you
that
you
dogs
he
dropped
on
one
knee
and
fired
into
the
brown
of
the
men
on
the
veranda
but
the
bullet
flew
high
and
landed
in
the
brickwork
with
a
vicious
that
made
some
of
the
younger
ones
turn
pale
it
is
as
musketry
theorists
observe
one
thing
to
fire
and
another
to
be
fired
at
then
the
instinct
of
the
chase
flared
up
the
news
spread
from
barrack
to
barrack
and
the
men
doubled
out
intent
on
the
capture
of
simmons
the
wild
beast
who
was
heading
for
the
cavalry
stopping
now
and
again
to
send
back
a
shot
and
a
curse
in
the
direction
of
his
pursuers
learn
you
to
spy
on
me
he
shouted

you
to
give

turned
towards

and

his
rifle

sir
colonel
john
anthony

sallied
out
only
to

by
a
spurt
of
dust
at
his
feet
up
said
the
second
in

do

my
step
in
that
way
colonel
he
as
dangerous
as
a
mad

him

then
said
the
colonel
bitterly
he
wo
take
his
chance
regiment
too
if
it
had
been
the
towheads
i
could
have
understood
private
simmons
had
occupied
a
strong
position
near
a
well
on
the
edge
of
the
and
was
defying
the
regiment
to
come
on
the
regiment
was
not
anxious
to
comply
for
there
is
small
honour
in
being
shot
by
a
only
corporal
slane
rifle
in
hand
threw
himself
down
on
the
ground
and
wormed
his
way
towards

he
to
the
men
round
him
as
not

livin
simmons
ceased
shouting
for
a
while
and
the
noise
of
could
be
heard
across
the
plain
major
oldyne
commanding
the
horse
battery
was
coming
back
from
a
dinner
in
the
civil
lines
was
driving
after
his
usual
custom
that
is
to
say
as
fast
as
the
horse
could
go
a
blooming
spangled
shrieked
simmons
make
a
scarecrow
of
that
the
trap
stopped
this
demanded
the
major
of

jerry
blazes
pass
frien
an
all
well
but
jerry
blazes
had
not
the
faintest
intention
of
passing
a
dangerous
murderer
he
was
as
his
adoring
battery
swore
long
and
fervently
without
knowledge
of
fear
and
they
were
surely
the
best
judges
for
jerry
blazes
it
was
notorious
had
done
his
possible
to
kill
a
man
each
time
the
battery
went
out
he
walked
towards
simmons
with
the
intention
of
rushing
him
and
knocking
him
down
make
me
do
it
sir
said
simmons
ai
got
nothing
agin
you
ah
you
would
the
major
broke
into
a
run
that
then
the
major
dropped
with
a
bullet
through
his
shoulder
and
simmons
stood
over
him
he
had
lost
the
satisfaction
of
killing
losson
in
the
desired
way
but
here
was
a
helpless
body
to
his
hand
should
he
slip
in
another
cartridge
and
blow
off
the
head
or
with
the
butt
smash
in
the
white
face
he
stopped
to
consider
and
a
cry
went
up
from
the
far
side
of
the
killed
jerry
blazes
but
in
the
shelter
of
the
simmons
was
safe
except
when
he
stepped
out
to
fire
blow

off

said
simmons
reflectively
an

an

for

he
tugged
at
the
string
of
the
second
packet
of
ammunition
corporal
slane
crawled
out
of
the
shadow
of
a
bank
into
the
moonlight

in

distance

slane
kicked
the
rifle
away
and
stood
up
in
the
peril
of
his
life
on
now
the
temptation
was
more
than
simmons
could
resist
for
the
corporal
in
his
white
clothes
offered
a
perfect
mark
misname
me
shouted
simmons
firing
as
he
spoke
the
shot
missed
and
the
shooter
blind
with
rage
threw
his
rifle
down
and
rushed
at
slane
from
the
protection
of
the
well
within
striking
distance
he
kicked
savagely
at
slane
stomach
but
the
weedy
corporal
knew
something
of
simmons
weakness
and
knew
too
the
deadly
guard
for
that
kick
bowing
forward
and
drawing
up
his
right
leg
till
the
heel
of
the
right
foot
was
set
some
three
inches
above
the
inside
of
the
left
he
met
the
blow
standing
on
one
leg
exactly
as
gonds
stand
when
they
meditate
and
ready
for
the
fall
that
would
follow
there
was
an
oath
the
corporal
fell
over
to
his
own
left
as
shinbone
met
shinbone
and
the
private
collapsed
his
right
leg
broken
an
inch
above
the
ankle
you
do
know
that
guard
sim
said
slane
spitting
out
the
dust
as
he
rose
then
raising
his
voice
an
take

this
was
not
strictly
true
for
the
private
had
accomplished
his
own
downfall
since
it
is
the
special
merit
of
that
that
the
harder
the
kick
the
greater
the
discomfiture
slane
walked
to
jerry
blazes
and
hung
over
him
with
ostentatious
anxiety
while
simmons
weeping
with
pain
was
carried
away
you
ai
badly
sir
said
slane
the
major
had
fainted
and
there
was
an
ugly
ragged
hole
through
the
top
of
his
arm
slane
knelt
down
and
murmured
me
i
believe
dead
well
if
that
ai
my
blooming
luck
all
over
but
the
major
was
destined
to
lead
his
battery
afield
for
many
a
long
day
with
unshaken
nerve
he
was
removed
and
nursed
and
petted
into
convalescence
while
the
battery
discussed
the
wisdom
of
capturing
simmons
and
blowing
him
from
a
gun
they
idolised
their
major
and
his
reappearance
on
parade
brought
about
a
scene
nowhere
provided
for
in
the
army
regulations
great
too
was
the
glory
that
fell
to
slane
share
the
gunners
would
have
made
him
drunk
thrice
a
day
for
at
least
a
fortnight
even
the
colonel
of
his
own
regiment
complimented
him
upon
his
coolness
and
the
local
paper
called
him
a
hero
these
things
did
not
puff
him
up
when
the
major
offered
him
money
and
thanks
the
virtuous
corporal
took
the
one
and
put
aside
the
other
but
he
had
a
request
to
make
and
prefaced
it
with
many
a
y
pardon
sir
could
the
major
see
his
way
to
letting
the
wedding
be
adorned
by
the
presence
of
four
battery
horses
to
pull
a
hired
barouche
the
major
could
and
so
could
the
battery
excessively
so
it
was
a
gorgeous
wedding
did
i
do
it
for
said
corporal
slane
the
o
course
jhansi
ai
a
beauty
to
look
at
but
i
was
goin
to
a
hired
jerry
blazes
if
i
wanted
something
sim
might
blowed
jerry
blazes
blooming
into
hirish
stew
for
aught
i
cared
and
they
hanged
private
simmons
hanged
him
as
high
as
haman
in
hollow
square
of
the
regiment
and
the
colonel
said
it
was
drink
and
the
chaplain
was
sure
it
was
the
devil
and
simmons
fancied
it
was
both
but
he
did
know
and
only
hoped
his
fate
would
be
a
warning
to
his
companions
and
half
a
dozen
publicists
wrote
six
beautiful
leading
articles
on
prevalence
of
crime
in
the
army
but
not
a
soul
thought
of
comparing
the
simmons
to
the
squawking
gaping
schoolgirl
with
which
this
story
opens
black
jack
to
the
wake
av
tim
came
company
all
patrick
alley
was
there
to
see
as
the
three
musketeers
share
their
silver
tobacco
and
liquor
together
as
they
protect
each
other
in
barracks
or
camp
and
as
they
rejoice
together
over
the
joy
of
one
so
do
they
divide
their
sorrows
when
ortheris
irrepressible
tongue
has
brought
him
into
cells
for
a
season
or
learoyd
has
run
amok
through
his
kit
and
accoutrements
or
mulvaney
has
indulged
in
strong
waters
and
under
their
influence
reproved
his
commanding
officer
you
can
see
the
trouble
in
the
faces
of
the
untouched
two
and
the
rest
of
the
regiment
know
that
comment
or
jest
is
unsafe
generally
the
three
avoid
orderly
room
and
the
corner
shop
that
follows
leaving
both
to
the
young
bloods
who
have
not
sown
their
wild
oats
but
there
are
occasions
for
instance
ortheris
was
sitting
on
the
drawbridge
of
the
main
gate
of
fort
amara
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
pipe
bowl
down
in
his
mouth
learoyd
was
lying
at
full
length
on
the
turf
of
the
glacis
kicking
his
heels
in
the
air
and
i
came
round
the
corner
and
asked
for
mulvaney
ortheris
spat
into
the
ditch
and
shook
his
head
good
seein
now
said
ortheris
a
bloomin
camel
listen
i
heard
on
the
flags
of
the
veranda
opposite
to
the
cells
which
are
close
to
the
a
measured
step
that
i
could
have
identified
in
the
tramp
of
an
army
there
were
twenty
paces
crescendo
a
pause
and
then
twenty
said
ortheris
gawd
that
all
for
a
button
you
could
see
your
face
in
an
a
bit
o
lip
that
a
harkangel
would
guv
back
mulvaney
was
doing
was
compelled
that
is
to
say
to
walk
up
and
down
for
certain
hours
in
full
marching
order
with
rifle
bayonet
ammunition
knapsack
and
overcoat
and
his
offence
was
being
dirty
on
parade
i
nearly
fell
into
the
fort
ditch
with
astonishment
and
wrath
for
mulvaney
is
the
smartest
man
that
ever
mounted
guard
and
would
as
soon
think
of
turning
out
uncleanly
as
of
dispensing
with
his
trousers
was
the
sergeant
that
checked
him
i
asked
o
course
said
ortheris
ai
no
other
man
would
whip
on
the
peg
so
but
mullins
ai
a
man
e
a
dirty
little
pigscraper
that
wot
is
did
mulvaney
say
he
not
the
make
of
man
to
take
that
quietly
bin
better
for
if
shut

lord

sargint
sez
an
then
we
fell
in
but
after
was
up
an
mullins
was
swearin
black
in
the
face
at
room
that
mulvaney
called
a
swine
an
lord
knows
wot

mullins

in
one
these
days
too
big

you
an
mulvaney
fell
away
nothin
you
know
never
speaks
to
the
colonel
for
fear
o
fresh
copped
mullins
a
very
young
and
very
much
married
sergeant
whose
manners
were
partly
the
result
of
innate
depravity
and
partly
of
imperfectly
digested
board
school
came
over
the
bridge
and
most
rudely
asked
ortheris
what
he
was
doing
said
ortheris
i
waiting
for
my
it
along
yit
mullins
turned
purple
and
passed
on
there
was
the
sound
of
a
gentle
chuckle
from
the
glacis
where
learoyd
lay
expects
to
get
some
day
explained
ortheris
gawd
the
mess
that
to
put
their
into
the
same
kiddy
as

his
mind

sir
trewth
i
would
a
shadow
fell
on
the
drawbridge
and
ortheris
began
to
rise
into
the
air
lifted
by
a
huge
hand
upon
his
collar
but
t
braass
said
learoyd
quietly
as
he
held
the
londoner
over
the
ditch
but
t
braass
ma
son
ah
got
one
rupee
eight
annas
of
ma
own
he
showed
two
coins
and
replaced
ortheris
on
the
drawbridge
rail
good
i
said
where
are
you
going
to
to
walk
orf
wen
comes
out
two
miles
or
three
or
fower
said
ortheris
the
footsteps
within
ceased
i
heard
the
dull
thud
of
a
knapsack
falling
on
a
bedstead
followed
by
the
rattle
of
arms
ten
minutes
later
mulvaney
faultlessly
dressed
his
lips
tight
and
his
face
as
black
as
a
thunderstorm
stalked
into
the
sunshine
on
the
drawbridge
learoyd
and
ortheris
sprang
from
my
side
and
closed
in
upon
him
both
leaning
towards
as
horses
lean
upon
the
pole
in
an
instant
they
had
disappeared
down
the
sunken
road
to
the
cantonments
and
i
was
left
alone
mulvaney
had
not
seen
fit
to
recognise
me
so
i
knew
that
his
trouble
must
be
heavy
upon
him
i
climbed
one
of
the
bastions
and
watched
the
figures
of
the
three
musketeers
grow
smaller
and
smaller
across
the
plain
they
were
walking
as
fast
as
they
could
put
foot
to
the
ground
and
their
heads
were
bowed
they
fetched
a
great
compass
round
the
skirted
the
cavalry
lines
and
vanished
in
the
belt
of
trees
that
fringes
the
low
land
by
the
river
i
followed
slowly
and
sighted
them
dusty
sweating
but
still
keeping
up
their
long
swinging
tramp
on
the
river
bank
they
crashed
through
the
forest
reserve
headed
towards
the
bridge
of
boats
and
presently
established
themselves
on
the
bow
of
one
of
the
pontoons
i
rode
cautiously
till
i
saw
three
puffs
of
white
smoke
rise
and
die
out
in
the
clear
evening
air
and
knew
that
peace
had
come
again
at
the
they
waved
me
forward
with
gestures
of
welcome
up
your
shouted
ortheris
come
on

all

in
this
bloomin

see
that

man

horse

the
sahib
require
aught
else
a
peg
or
beer
ritchie
sahib
had
left
half
a
dozen
bottles
of
the
latter
but
since
the
sahib
was
a
friend
of
ritchie
sahib
and
he
the
was
a
poor
man
i
gave
my
order
quietly
and
returned
to
the
bridge
mulvaney
had
taken
off
his
boots
and
was
dabbling
his
toes
in
the
water
learoyd
was
lying
on
his
back
on
the
pontoon
and
ortheris
was
pretending
to
row
with
a
big
bamboo
an
ould
fool
said
mulvaney
reflectively

to

bamboo

an
bit

ortheris
squeaked
shrilly
the
butler
of
the
forest
bungalow
was
standing
near
the
railings
with
a
basket
uncertain
how
to
clamber
down
to
the
pontoon

the
basket
on
the
pontoon
in
an
instant
and
the
three
musketeers
gathered
round
it
with
dry
lips
they
drank
my
health
in
due
and
ancient
form
and
thereafter
tobacco
tasted
sweeter
than
ever
they
absorbed
all
the
beer
and
disposed
themselves
in
picturesque
attitudes
to
admire
the
setting
sun
no
man
speaking
for
a
while
mulvaney
head
dropped
upon
his
chest
and
we
thought
that
he
was
asleep
on

three
quarters
of

for
five
an
a
miles
we
to
run
like
jimmy
o
the
three
musketeers
clambered
on
to
the
bridge
and
departed
hastily
in
the
direction
of
the
cantonment
road
when
i
overtook
them
i
offered
them
two
stirrups
and
a
tail
which
they
accepted
enthusiastically
ortheris
held
the
tail
and
in
this
manner
we
trotted
steadily
through
the
shadows
by
an
unfrequented
road
at
the
turn
into
the
cantonments
we
heard
carriage
wheels
it
was
the
colonel
barouche
and
in
it
sat
the
colonel
wife
and
daughter
i
caught
a
suppressed
chuckle
and
my
beast
sprang
forward
with
a
lighter
step
the
three
musketeers
had
vanished
into
the
night
and
they
were
stronger
hands
than
mine
that
digged
the
ruby
from
the
earth
more
cunning
brains
that
made
it
worth
the
large
desire
of
a
king
and
bolder
hearts
that
through
the
brine
went
down
the
perfect
pearl
to
bring
lo
i

made
in
common
clay
rude
figures
of
a
race
for
pearls
strew
not

in
this
my
town
of
banishment
where
with
the
shifting
dust
i
play
and
eat
the
bread
of
discontent
yet
is
there
life
in
that

make
oh
thou
who
knowest
turn
and
see
as
thou
hast
power
over
me
so
i
have
power
over
these
because
i
wrought
them
for
thy
sake
and
breathed
in
them
mine
agonies
small
mirth
was
in
the
making
now
i
lift
the
cloth
that
clokes
the
clay
and
wearied
at
thy
feet
i
lay
my
wares
ere

go
forth

curtiss

doing

almost
immediately

as
sure
as

have
you

it

expensive

here
they
would
have
been
out

a
month

should
decidedly
like
to
be
gaddy
mackesy
he
go
home
after
he
married
and
send
in
his
papers
see
if
he
does
blayne
why
should
he
has
he
money
would
any
one
of
us
be
here
if
we
were
paupers
doone
poor
old
pauper
what
has
became
of
the
six
hundred
you
rooked
from
our
table
last
month
blayne
it
took
unto
itself
wings
i
think
an
enterprising
tradesman
got
some
of
it
and
a
gobbled
the
rest
or
else
i
spent
it
curtiss
gaddy
never
had
dealings
with
a
in
his
life
doone
virtuous
gaddy
if
had
three
thousand
a
month
paid
from
england
i
do
think
i
deal
with
a
either
mackesy
yawning
oh
it
a
sweet
life
i
wonder
whether
matrimony
would
make
it
sweeter
curtiss
ask
cockley
with
his
wife
dying
by
inches
blayne
go
home
and
get
a
fool
of
a
girl
to
come
out
to
what
is
it
thackeray
says
splendid
palace
of
an
indian
doone
which
reminds
me
my
quarters
leak
like
a
sieve
i
had
fever
last
night
from
sleeping
in
a
swamp
and
the
worst
of
it
is
one
ca
do
anything
to
a
roof
till
the
rains
are
over
curtiss
what
wrong
with
you
have
eighty
rotting
tommies
to
take
into
a
running
stream
doone
no
but
i
mixed
boils
and
bad
language
i
a
regular
job
all
over
my
body
it
sheer
poverty
of
blood
and
i
do
see
any
chance
of
getting
richer
either
way
blayne
ca
you
take
leave
doone
that
the
pull
you
army
men
have
over
us
ten
days
are
nothing
in
your
sight
so
important
that
government
ca
find
a
substitute
if
i
go
away
i
like
to
be
gaddy
whoever
his
wife
may
be
curtiss
you
passed
the
turn
of
life
that
mackesy
was
speaking
of
doone
indeed
i
have
but
i
never
yet
had
the
brutality
to
ask
a
woman
to
share
my
life
out
here
blayne
on
my
soul
i
believe
you
right
i
thinking
of
cockley
the
woman
an
absolute
wreck
doone
exactly
because
she
stays
down
here
the
only
way
to
keep
her
fit
would
be
to
send
her
to
the
hills
for
eight
months
and
the
same
with
any
woman
i
fancy
i
see
myself
taking
a
wife
on
those
terms
mackesy
with
the
rupee
at
one
and
sixpence
the
little
doones
would
be
little
dehra
doones
with
a
fine
mussoorie
anent
to
bring
home
for
the
holidays
curtiss
and
a
pair
of
for
doone
to
wear
free
of
expense
presented
by
doone
yes
it
an
enchanting
prospect
by
the
way
the
rupee
done
falling
yet
the
time
will
come
when
we
shall
think
ourselves
lucky
if
we
only
lose
half
our
pay
curtiss
surely
a
third
loss
enough
who
gains
by
the
arrangement
that
what
i
want
to
know
blayne
the
silver
question
i
going
to
bed
if
you
begin
squabbling
thank
goodness
here
anthony
looking
like
a

ghastly
curtiss

a

i
told
him
not

anthony
he
has
his
leave

in
confidence
though
mackesy
all
the
station
knows
it
anthony
suppose
i
shall

i
he
has
nothing
more

a
tummy
if

could
only
keep
a

how
much
he
be
blayne
he
he
going
to
be
married
in
a
few
weeks
markyn
told
me
at
the
judge
this
evening
it
anthony
you
do
say
so
holy
moses
there
be
a
shine
in
the
tents
of
kedar
curtiss
cut
up
rough
think
you
anthony
know
anything
about
the
regiment
mackesy
it
is
bigamy
then
anthony
maybe
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
men
have
forgotten
or
is
there
more
charity
in
the
world
than
i
thought
doone
you
do
look
pretty
when
you
are
trying
to
keep
a
secret
you
bloat
explain
anthony
herriott
blayne
a
long
pause
to
the
room
it
my
notion
that
we
are
a
set
of
fools
mackesy
nonsense
business
was
knocked
on
the
head
last
season
why
young
mallard
anthony
mallard
was
a
candlestick
paraded
as
such
think
awhile
recollect
last
season
and
the
talk
then
mallard
or
no
mallard
did
gaddy
ever
talk
to
any
other
woman
curtiss
there
something
in
that
it
slightly
noticeable
now
you
come
to
mention
it
but
she
at
naini
tal
and
he
at
simla
anthony
he
had
to
go
to
simla
to
look
after
a
globetrotter
relative
of
his
a
person
with
a
title
uncle
or
aunt
blayne
and
there
he
got
engaged
no
law
prevents
a
man
growing
tired
of
a
woman
anthony
except
that
he
must
do
it
till
the
woman
is
tired
of
him
and
the
herriott
woman
was
not
that
curtiss
she
may
be
now
two
months
of
naini
tal
work
wonders
doone
curious
thing
how
some
women
carry
a
fate
with
them
there
was
a
deegie
in
the
central
provinces
whose
men
invariably
fell
away
and
got
married
it
became
a
regular
proverb
with
us
when
i
was
down
there
i
remember
three
men
desperately
devoted
to
her
and
they
all
one
after
another
took
wives
curtiss
that
odd
now
i
should
have
thought
that
influence
would
have
led
them
to
take
other
men
wives
it
ought
to
have
made
them
afraid
of
the
judgment
of
providence
anthony
herriott
will
make
gaddy
afraid
of
something
more
than
the
judgment
of
providence
i
fancy
blayne
supposing
things
are
as
you
say
he
be
a
fool
to
face
her
he
sit
tight
at
simla
anthony
be
a
bit
surprised
if
he
went
off
to
naini
to
explain
he
an
unaccountable
sort
of
man
and
she
likely
to
be
a
more
than
unaccountable
woman
doone
what
makes
you
take
her
character
away
so
confidently
anthony
gaddy
was
her
first
and
a
woman
does
allow
her
first
man
to
drop
away
without
expostulation
she
justifies
the
first
transfer
of
affection
to
herself
by
swearing
that
it
is
for
ever
and
ever
consequently
blayne
consequently
we
are
sitting
here
till
past
one
talking
scandal
like
a
set
of
station
cats
anthony
it
all
your
fault
we
were
perfectly
respectable
till
you
came
in
go
to
bed
i
off
all
curtiss
past

it
past
two
by
jove
and
here
the
coming
for
the
late
charge
just
heavens
one
two
three
four
rupees
to
pay
for
the
pleasure
of
saying
that
a
poor
little
beast
of
a
woman
is
no
better
than
she
should
be
i
ashamed
of
myself
go
to
bed
you
slanderous
villains
and
if
i
sent
to
beora
be
prepared
to
hear
i
dead
before
paying
my
card
account
the
tents
of
kedar
only
why
should
it
be
with
pain
at
all
why
must
i
the
leaves
of
coronal
put
any
kiss
of
pardon
on
thy
brow
why
should
the
other
women
know
so
much
and
talk
together
such
the
look
and
such
the
smile
he

and
every
time
the
twelve

upon
a
time
what
an
ass
a
man
can
make
of
himself
herself
to
a
paper

seven
peas
some
stamped

and
a
spoonful
of
that
is
an
answer

me
whether
i
have
done

g
if
it
is
ended
here
there
will
be
a
ghastly
scene
somewhere
else
if
only
i

to

and
stood
the
racket
at
long
range
simpkin
i
tell
you
later
on
tell
me
it
must
be
some
foolish
misunderstanding
and
you
know
that
there
was
to

nothing
of

the

a
thought

devil
help
me
through
with
it
and
believe
me
i
do
not
care
how
often
or
how
tenderly
you
think
of
the
vaynor
man
i
wonder
if
you
mean
oh
what
the
good
of
squabbling
and
pretending
to
misunderstand
when
you
are
only
up
for
so
short
a
time
pip
do
be
a
stupid
a
pause
during
which
he
crosses
his
left
leg
over
his
right
and
continues
his
capt
answer
to
the
thunderstorm
in
her
corns
my
worst
upon
my
word
you
are
the
very
rudest
man
in
the
world
do
it
again
capt
g
no
i
do
think

but
i
wonder
what
you
will
do

all
over

simpkin
well
have
you
the
grace
to
apologise
bad
man
capt
g
i
must
let
it
drift
back
trust
a
woman
for
being
as
blind
as
a
bat
when
she
wo
see
i
waiting
or
would
you
like
me
to
dictate
a
form
of
apology
capt
g
by
all
means
dictate
h
very
well
rehearse
your
several
christian
names
after
me
and
go
on
my
sincere
repentance
capt
repentance
having
behaved
capt
g
at
last
i
wish
to
goodness
she
look
away
having
behaved
as
i
have
behaved
and
declare
that
i
am
thoroughly
and
heartily
sick
of
the
whole
business
and
take
this
opportunity
of
making
clear
my
intention
of
ending
it
now
henceforward
and
for
ever
if
any
one
had
told
me
i
should
be
such
a
blackguard
a
spoonful
of
potato
chips
into
her
not
a
pretty
joke
capt
no
it
a
reality
i
wonder
if
smashes
of
this
kind
are
always
so
raw
really
pip
you
getting
more
absurd
every
day
capt
i
do
think
you
quite
understand
me
shall
i
repeat
it
no
for
pity
sake
do
do
that
it
too
terrible
even
in
fun
capt
i
let
her
think
it
over
for
a
while
but
i
ought
to
be
i
want
to
know
what
you
meant
by
what
you
said
just
now
capt
exactly
what
i
said
no
less
but
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
it
what
i
done
capt
g
if
she
only
would
look
at
me
and
very
slowly
his
eyes
on
his
remember
that
evening
in
july
before
the
rains
broke
when
you
said
that
the
end
would
have
to
come
sooner
or
later
and
you
wondered
for
which
of
us
it
would
come
first
yes
i
was
only
joking
and
you
swore
that
as
long
as
there
was
breath
in
your
body
it
should
come
and
i
believed
you
capt
well
it
has
that
all
long
pause
during
which
bows
her
head
and
rolls
the
into
little
pellets
at
the
back
her
head
and
laughing
they
train
us
women
well
do
they
pip
capt
touching
so
far
as
the
expression
goes
it
is
in
her
nature
to
take
things
quietly
be
an
explosion
yet
a
thank
you
even
red
indians
allow
people
to
wriggle
when
they
being
tortured
i
believe
fan
from
girdle
and
fans
slowly
rim
of
fan
level
with
partner
on
left
very
close
is
it
find
it
too
much
for
you
oh
no
not
in
the
least
but
they
really
ought

too
well
and
been
properly
brought
up

except
for

would
it
be
rather
impertinent
of
me
to
say
that
i
sorry
for
you
i
think
you
have
said
it
once
or
twice
before
you
growing
very
careful
of
my
feelings

god

was
a
good
woman

iced
capt
i
am
sorry
for
you
if
you
want
the
pity
of
such
a
brute
as
i
am
i
sorry
for
you
rather
tame
for
a
man
of
the
world
do
you
think
that
that
admission
clears
you
capt
what
can
i
do
i
can
only
tell
you
what
i
think
of
myself
you
ca
think
worse
than
that
oh
yes
i
can
and
now
will
you
tell
me
the
reason
of
all
this
remorse
has
bayard
been
suddenly
capt
his
eyes
still
no
the
thing
has
come
to
an
end
on
my
side
that
all
all
as
though
i
were
a
cairene
dragoman
you
used
to
make
prettier
speeches
remember
when
you
said
capt
for
heaven
sake
do
bring
that
back
call
me
anything
you
like
and
i
admit
it
but
you
do
care
to
be
reminded
of
old
lies
if
i
could
hope
to
hurt
you
as
much
as
you
have
hurt
me
no
i
would
i
could
do
it
liar
though
you
are
capt
i
spoken
the
truth
my
sir
you
flatter
yourself
you
have
lied
over
the
reason
pip
remember
that
i
know
you
as
you
do
know
yourself
you
have
been
everything
to
me
though
you
are
oh
what
a
contemptible
it
is
and
so
you
are
merely
tired
of
me
capt
since
you
insist
upon
my
repeating
it
yes
lie
the
first
i
wish
i
knew
a
coarser
word
lie
seems
so
ineffectual
in
your
case
the
fire
has
just
died
out
and
there
is
no
fresh
one
think
for
a
minute
pip
if
you
care
whether
i
despise
you
more
than
i
do
simply
is
it
capt
yes
i
think
i
deserve
this
lie
number
two
before
the
next
glass
chokes
you
tell
me
her
name
capt
g
i
make
her
pay
for
dragging
minnie
into
the
business
is
it
likely
likely
if
you
thought
that
it
would
flatter
your
vanity
you
cry
my
name
on
the
to
make
people
turn
round
capt
i
wish
i
had
there
would
have
been
an
end
of
this
business
oh
no
there
would
not
and
so
you
were
going
to
be
virtuous
and
were
you
to
come
to
me
and
say
done
with
you
the
incident
is
i
ought
to
be
proud
of
having
kept
such
a
man
so
long
capt
g
it
only
remains
to
pray
for
the
end
of
the
dinner
you
know
what
i
think
of
myself
as
it
the
only
person
in
the
world
you
ever
think
of
and
as
i
know
your
mind
thoroughly
i
do
you
want
to
get
it
all
over
and
oh
i
ca
keep
you
back
and
you
going
think
of
it
pip
to
throw
me
over
for
another
woman
and
you
swore
that
all
other
women
were
pip
my
pip
she
care
for
you
as
i
do
believe
me
she
ca
is
it
any
one
that
i
know
capt
thank
goodness
it
is
i
expected
a
cyclone
but
not
an
earthquake
she
is
there
anything
that
i
would
do
for
you
or
have
done
and
to
think
that
i
should
take
this
trouble
over
you
knowing
what
you
are
do
you
despise
me
for
it
capt
his
mouth
to
hide
a
it
entirely
a
work
of
charity
on
your
part
ahhh
but
i
have
no
right
to
resent
is
she
than
i
who
was
it
said
capt
no
not
that
i
be
more
merciful
than
you
were
do
you
know
that
all
women
are
alike
capt
then
this
is
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule
of
them
i
tell
you
anything
you
like
i
will
upon
my
word
they
only
want
the
admiration
from
anybody
no
matter
who
anybody
but
there
is
always
man
that
they
care
for
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
and
would
sacrifice
all
the
others
to
oh
listen
i
kept
the
vaynor
man
trotting
after
me
like
a
poodle
and
he
believes
that
he
is
the
only
man
i
am
interested
in
i
tell
you
what
he
said
to
me
capt
spare
him
i
wonder
what
version
is
he
been
waiting
for
me
to
look
at
him
all
through
dinner
shall
i
do
it
and
you
can
see
what
an
idiot
he
looks
capt
what
imports
the
nomination
of
this
gentleman
watch
a
glance
to
the
vaynor
man
who
tries
vainly
to
combine
a
mouthful
of
ice
pudding
a
smirk
of
a
glare
of
intense
devotion
and
the
stolidity
of
a
british
dining
capt
he
does
look
pretty
why
did
you
wait
till
the
spoon
was
out
of
his
mouth
to
amuse
you
she
make
an
exhibition
of
you
as
i
made
of
him
and
people
will
laugh
at
you
oh
pip
ca
you
see
that
as
plain
as
the
noonday
sun
you
be
trotted
about
and
told
lies
and
made
a
fool
of
like
the
others
never
made
a
fool
of
you
did
i
capt
what
a
clever
little
woman
it
is
well
what
have
you
to
say
capt
i
feel
better
yes
i
suppose
so
after
i
have
come
down
to
your
level
i
could
have
done
it
if
i
had
cared
for
you
so
much
i
have
spoken
the
truth
capt
it
does
alter
the
situation
then
she
said
that
she
cares
for
you
do
believe
her
pip
it
a
lie
as
bad
as
yours
to
me
capt
ssssteady
i
a
notion
that
a
friend
of
yours
is
looking
at
you
he
i
him
he
introduced
you
to
me
capt
and
some
people
would
like
women
to
assist
in
making
the
laws
introduction
to
imply
condonement
well
you
see
if
you
can
remember
so
far
back
as
that
i
could
in
common
politeness
refuse
the
offer
in
common
politeness
we
have
got
beyond
capt
old
ground
means
fresh
trouble
on
my
honour
your
ha
ha
capt
dishonour
then
she
not
what
you
imagine
i
meant
to
do
tell
me
anything
about
her
she
care
for
you
and
when
you
come
back
after
having
made
an
exhibition
of
yourself
find
me
occupied
with
capt
you
could
while
i
am
alive
if
that
does
bring
her
pride
to
her
rescue
nothing
will
herself
could
do
it
you
right
i
do
believe
i
could
though
you
are
what
you
are
a
coward
and
a
liar
in
grain
capt
it
does
hurt
so
much
after
your
little
lecture
with
demonstrations
one
mass
of
vanity
will
nothing
touch
you
in
this
life
there
must
be
a
hereafter
if
it
only
for
the
benefit
of
you
will
have
it
all
to
yourself
capt
his
are
you
so
certain
of
that
i
shall
have
had
mine
in
this
life
and
it
will
serve
me
right
capt
but
the
admiration
that
you
insisted
on
so
strongly
a
moment
ago
oh
i
a
brute
will
console
me
for
knowing
that
you
will
go
to
her
with
the
same
words
the
same
arguments
and
the
the
same
pet
names
you
used
to
me
and
if
she
cares
for
you
you
two
will
laugh
over
my
story
wo
that
be
punishment
heavy
enough
even
for
me
even
for
me
and
it
all
useless
that
another
punishment
capt
oh
come
i
not
so
low
as
you
think
not
now
perhaps
but
you
will
be
oh
pip
if
a
woman
flatters
your
vanity
there
nothing
on
earth
that
you
would
not
tell
her
and
no
meanness
that
you
would
not
do
have
i
known
you
so
long
without
knowing
that
capt
if
you
can
trust
me
in
nothing
else
and
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
trusted
you
can
count
upon
my
holding
my
tongue
if
you
denied
everything
you
said
this
evening
and
declared
it
was
all
in
fun
long
i
trust
you
not
otherwise
all
i
ask
is
do
tell
her
my
name
do
a
man
might
forget
a
woman
never
would
up
table
and
sees
hostess
beginning
to
collect
so
it
all
ended
through
no
fault
of
mine
have
i
behaved
beautifully
i
accepted
your
dismissal
and
you
managed
it
as
cruelly
as
you
could
and
i
have
made
you
respect
my
sex
have
i
gloves
and
i
only
pray
that
she
know
you
some
day
as
i
know
you
now
i
would
be
you
then
for
i
think
even
your
conceit
will
be
hurt
i
hope
she
pay
you
back
the
humiliation
you
brought
on
me
i
hope
no
i
do
i
give
you
up
i
must
have
something
to
look
forward
to
or
i
shall
go
crazy
when
it
all
over
come
back
to
me
come
back
to
me
and
you
find
that
you
my
pip
still
capt
move
and
you
pay
for
it

a
girl

i
would
insult
you
by
asking
a
girl

very
long
ago

good
to
her
pip
i
daresay
she
believes
in
you

with
an
uncertain
smile
he
watches
her
through
the
door
and
settles
into
a
chair
as
the
men

now
if
there
is
any
power
who
looks
after

was
a
pincushion

immense
that

a
necessary
evil
and

husband
never
never

your
wife
anything
that

so
very
much
more
than
you
dearest
to
begin
with
i
your
wife
capt
so
i
have
been
led
to
believe
and
i
shall
want
to
know
every
one
of
your
secrets
to
share
everything
you
know
with
you
round
capt
so
you
shall
dear
so
you
shall
but
do
look
like
that
for
your
own
sake
do
stop
me
phil
i
shall
never
talk
to

in
this
way
again
you
must
tell
me
at
least
not
now
later
on
when
i
an
old
matron
it
wo
matter
but
if
you
love
me
be
very
good
to
me
now
for
this
part
of
my
life
i
shall
forget

i
made
you

i
think
so
child
have
i
said
anything
yet
that
you
disapprove
of

you
be
angry
that
that
voice
and
what
you
said
about
the
engagement
capt
but
you
to
be
told
that
darling
and
why
you
should
have
told
me
you
must
be
the
judge
and
oh
pip
dearly
as
i
love
you
i
sha
be
able
to
help
you
i
shall
hinder
you
and
you
must
judge
in
spite
of
me
capt
we
have
a
great
many
things
to
find
out
together
god
help
us
both
say
so
pussy
but
we
shall
understand
each
other
better
every
day
and
i
think
i
beginning
to
see
now
how
in
the
world
did
you
come
to
know
just
the
importance
of
giving
me
just
that
lead
i
told
you
that
i
know
only
somehow
it
seemed
that
in
all
this
new
life
i
was
being
guided
for
your
sake
as
well
as
my
own
capt
then
mafflin
was
right
they
know
and
we
blind
all
of
us
a
little
beyond
our
depth
dear
are
we
i
remember
and
if
i
fail
let
me
be
punished
as
i
deserve
there
shall
be
no
punishment
we
start
into
life
together
from
here
you
and
i
and
no
one
else
capt
and
no
one
else
your
eyelashes
are
all
wet
sweet
was
there
ever
such
a
quaint
little
absurdity
was
there
ever
such
nonsense
talked
before
capt
the
ashes
out
of
his
is
what
we
say
it
what
we
do
say
that
helps
and
it
all
the
profoundest
philosophy
but
no
one
would
understand
even
if
it
were
put
into
a
book
the
idea
no
only
we
ourselves
or
people
like
ourselves
if
there
are
any
people
like
us
capt
all
people
not
like
ourselves
are
blind
idiots
her
do
you
think
then
that
there
are
any
people
as
happy
as
we
are
capt
be
unless
we
appropriated
all
the
happiness
in
the
world
towards
poor
dears
just
fancy
if
we
have
capt
then
we
hang
on
to
the
whole
show

great
deal
too
jolly
to
lose

that
banjo

me
to

sunset
mind

amazingly
difficult
to
keep
a
banjo

proper
pitch
it
the

with
all
musical
instruments
what
shall
it

as
i
sprawled
oh

that
enough
well
what
happened
capt
i
could
get
to
my
holster
and
mafflin
came
round

corner
and
stopped
the
performance
how
he
such
a
lazy
man
i
do
believe
he
did
capt
do
you
i
do
think
the
man
had
much
doubt
about
it
jack
cut
his
head
off
cut
his
head
off
one
blow
as
they
say
in
the
books
capt
i
not
sure
i
was
too
interested
in
myself
to
know
much
about
it
anyhow
the
head
was
off
and
jack
was
punching
old
van
loo
in
the
ribs
to
make
him
get
up
now
you
know
all
about
it
dear
and
now
you
want
me
to
go
of
course
you
never
told
me
about
this
though
i
been
married
to
you
for
so
long
and
you
never
have
told
me
if
i
had
found
out
and
you
never
tell
me
anything
about
yourself
or
what
you
do
or
what
you
take
an
interest
in
capt
darling
i
always
with
you
are
i
always
in
my
pocket
you
were
going
to
say
i
know
you
are
but
you
are
always
away
from
me
capt
to
hide
a
am
i
i
was
aware
of
it
sorry
oh
do
make
fun
of
me
pip
you
know
what
i
mean
when
you
are
reading
one
of
those
things
about
cavalry
by
that
idiotic
prince
why
does
he
a
prince
instead
of
a
capt
prince
kraft
a
oh
my
aunt
never
mind
dear
you
were
going
to
say
it
does
matter
you
do
care
for
what
i
say
only
only
you
get
up
and
walk
about
the
room
staring
in
front
of
you
and
then
mafflin
comes
in
to
dinner
and
after
i
in
the
i
can
hear
you
and
him
talking
and
talking
and
talking
about
things
i
understand
and
oh
i
get
tired
and
feel
lonely
i
want
to
complain
and
be
a
trouble
pip
but
i
do
indeed
i
do
capt
my
poor
darling
i
never
thought
of
that
why
do
you
ask
some
nice
people
in
to
dinner
nice
people
where
am
i
to
find
them
horrid
frumps
and
if
i
i
should
be
amused
you
know
i
only
want
capt
and
you
have
me
surely
sweetheart
i
have
not
pip
why
do
you
take
me
into
your
life
capt
more
than
i
do
that
would
be
difficult
dear
yes
i
suppose
it
would
to
you
i
no
help
to
you
no
companion
to
you
and
you
like
to
have
it
so
capt
are
you
a
little
unreasonable
pussy
her
i
the
most
reasonable
woman
in
the
world
when
i
treated
properly
capt
and
since
when
have
i
been
treating
you
improperly
always
and
since
the
beginning
you
you
have
capt
i
do
but
i
willing
to
be
convinced
to
there
capt
how
do
you
mean
what
does
all
mean
why
am
i
not
to
be
told
is
it
so
precious
capt
i
forget
its
exact
government
value
just
at
present
it
means
that
it
is
a
great
deal
too
heavy
then
why
do
you
touch
it
capt
to
make
it
lighter
see
here
little
love
i
one
notion
and
jack
has
another
but
we
are
both
agreed
that
all
this
equipment
is
about
thirty
pounds
too
heavy
the
thing
is
how
to
cut
it
down
without
weakening
any
part
of
it
and
at
the
same
time
allowing
the
trooper
to
carry
everything
he
wants
for
his
own
comfort
socks
and
shirts
and
things
of
that
kind
why
does
he
pack
them
in
a
little
trunk
capt
oh
you
darling
pack
them
in
a
little
trunk
indeed
hussars
do
carry
trunks
and
it
a
most
important
thing
to
make
the
horse
do
all
the
carrying
but
why
need
bother
about
it
you
not
a
trooper
capt
no
but
i
command
a
few
score
of
him
and
equipment
is
nearly
everything
in
these
days
more
than
capt
stupid
of
course
not
but
it
a
matter
that
i
tremendously
interested
in
because
if
i
or
jack
or
i
and
jack
work
out
some
sort
of
lighter
saddlery
and
all
that
it
possible
that
we
may
get
it
adopted
how
capt
sanctioned
at
home
where
they
will
make
a
sealed
pattern
a
pattern
that
all
the
saddlers
must
copy
and
so
it
will
be
used
by
all
the
regiments
and
that
interests
you
capt
it
part
of
my
profession
and
my
profession
is
a
good
deal
to
me
everything
in
a
soldier
equipment
is
important
and
if
we
can
improve
that
equipment
so
much
the
better
for
the
soldiers
and
for
us
who
capt
jack
and
i
only
jack
notions
are
too
radical
what
that
big
sigh
for
minnie
oh
nothing
and
you
kept
all
this
a
secret
from
me
why
capt
not
a
secret
exactly
dear
i
did
say
anything
about
it
to
you
because
i
did
think
it
would
amuse
you
and
am
i
only
made
to
be
amused
capt
no
of
course
i
merely
mean
that
it
could
interest
you
it
work
and
and
if
you
let
me
i
count
all
these
things
up
if
they
are
too
heavy
you
know
by
how
much
they
are
too
heavy
and
you
must
have
a
list
of
things
made
out
to
your
scale
of
lightness
and
capt
i
have
got
both
scales
somewhere
in
my
head
but
it
hard
to
tell
how
light
you
can
make
a
headstall
for
instance
until
actually
had
a
model
made
but
if
you
read
out
the
list
i
could
copy
it
down
and
pin
it
up
there
just
above
your
table
would
that
do
capt
it
would
be
nice
dear
but
it
would
be
giving
you
trouble
for
nothing
i
ca
work
that
way
i
go
by
rule
of
thumb
i
know
the
present
scale
of
weights
and
the
other
one
the
one
that
i
trying
to
work
to
will
shift
and
vary
so
much
that
i
could
be
certain
even
if
i
wrote
it
down
i
sorry
i
thought
i
might
help
is
there
anything
else
that
i
could
be
of
use
in
capt
round
the
i
ca
think
of
anything
helping
me
you
know
am
i
how
capt
you
are
you
of
course
and
as
long
as
you
near
me
i
explain
exactly
but
it
in
the
air
and
that
why
you
wanted
to
send
me
away
capt
that
only
when
i
trying
to
do
work
grubby
work
like
this
mafflin
better
then
is
he
capt
of
course
he
is
jack
and
i
have
been
thinking
along
the
same
groove
for
two
or
three
years
about
this
equipment
our
hobby
and
it
may
really
be
useful
some
day
a
and
that
all
that
you
have
away
from
me
capt
it
is
very
far
away
from
you
now
take
care
the
oil
on
that
bit
does
come
off
on
your
dress
i
wish
i
wish
so
much

could
really
help
you

believe
i
could
if
i
left
the
room

they
insist
on
falling

minnie
if
i
were
you
i
really
should
not
investigate
those
papers

may
come
across
something
that
you
wo
like
why
will
you
always
treat
me
like
a
child
i
know
i
not
displacing
the
horrid
things
capt
very
well
then
do
blame
me
if

and
let
me
go
on
with
the
saddlery

long
and
designedly
loathsome
account
of
glanders
and
oh
that
enough
do
go
on
capt
but
you
wanted
to
know
then
these
things
suppurate
and
matterate

horrid
disgusting
schoolboy

enough
to
pick
me
up
and
put
me
outside
the
door
and
leave
me
there
to
cry
are
you
capt
it
seems
to
me
that
you
an
irrational
little
baby
are
you
quite
well
do
i
look
ill
to
who
is
your
lady
friend
with
the
big
gray
envelope
and
the
fat
monogram
outside
capt
then
it
was
locked
up
confound
it
made
her
therefore
let
her
pass
for
a
woman
you
remember
what
are
like
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
going
to
open
it
may
i
capt
certainly
if
you
want
to
i
sooner
you
did
though
i
do
ask
to
look
at
your
letters
to
the
deercourt
girl
you
not
sir
letter
from
now
may
i
look
if
you
say
no
i
shall
cry
capt
you
never
cried
in
my
knowledge
of
you
and
i
do
believe
you
could
i
feel
very
like
it
pip
do
be
hard
on
me
it
begins
in
the
middle
without
any
captain
gadsby
or
anything
how
funny
capt
no
it
not
dear
captain
gadsby
or
anything
now
how
funny
what
a
strange
letter
so
the
moth
has
come
too
near
the
candle
at
last
and
has
been
singed
into
shall
i
say
respectability
i
congratulate
him
and
hope
he
will
be
as
happy
as
he
deserves
to
be
what
does
that
mean
is
she
congratulating
you
about
our
marriage
capt
yes
i
suppose
so
reading
she
seems
to
be
a
particular
friend
of
yours
capt
yes
she
was
an
excellent
matron
of
sorts
a
herriott
wife
of
a
colonel
herriott
i
used
to
know
some
of
her
people
at
home
long
ago
before
i
came
out
some
colonels
wives
are
young
as
young
as
me
i
knew
one
who
was
younger
capt
then
it
could
have
been
herriott
she
was
old
enough
to
have
been
your
mother
dear
i
remember
now
scargill
was
talking
about
her
at
the
duffins
tennis
before
you
came
for
me
on
tuesday
captain
mafflin
said
she
was
a
old
woman
do
you
know
i
think
mafflin
is
a
very
clumsy
man
with
his
feet
capt
good
old
jack
why
dear
he
had
put
his
cup
down
on
the
ground
then
and
he
literally
stepped
into
it
some
of
the
tea
spirted
over
my
dress
the
gray
one
i
meant
to
tell
you
about
it
before
capt
there
are
the
makings
of
a
strategist
about
jack
though
his
methods
are
coarse
you
better
get
a
new
dress
then
let
us
pray
that
that
will
turn
her
oh
it
is
stained
in
the
least
i
only
thought
that
i
tell
you
to
an
extraordinary
person
need
i
remind
you
that
you
have
taken
upon
yourself
a
charge
of
wardship
what
in
the
world
is
a
charge
of
wardship
as
you
yourself
know
may
end
in
consequences
capt
it
safest
to
let
see
everything
as
they
come
across
it
but
to
me
that
there
are
exceptions
to
the
rule
i
told
you
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
from
rearranging
my
table
what
the
woman
mean
she
goes
on
talking
about
consequences
inevitable
consequences
with
a
capital
c
for
half
a
page
oh
good
gracious
how
abominable
capt
do
you
think
so
does
it
show
a
sort
of
motherly
interest
in
us
thank
heaven
harry
always
wrapped
her
meaning
up
safely
is
it
absolutely
necessary
to
go
on
with
the
letter
darling
it
impertinent
it
simply
horrid
what
has
this
woman
to
write
in
this
way
to
you
she
ought
to
capt
when
you
write
to
the
deercourt
girl
i
notice
that
you
generally
fill
three
or
four
sheets
ca
you
let
an
old
woman
babble
on
paper
once
in
a
way
she
means
well
i
do
care
she
should
write
and
if
she
did
you
ought
to
have
shown
me
her
letter
capt
ca
you
understand
why
i
kept
it
to
myself
or
must
i
explain
at
length
as
i
explained
the
pip
i
you
this
is
as
bad
as
those
idiotic
on
the
floor
never
mind
whether
it
would
please
me
or
not
you
ought
to
have
given
it
to
me
to
read
capt
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
you
took
it
yourself
yes
but
if
i
had
taken
it
you
would
have
said
a
word
i
think
this
harriet
herriott
it
like
a
name
in
a
book
is
an
interfering
old
thing
capt
so
long
as
you
thoroughly
understand
that
she
old
i
do
much
care
what
you
think
very
good
dear
would
you
like
to
write
and
tell
her
so
she
seven
thousand
miles
away
i
do
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
her
but
you
ought
to
have
told
me
to
last
page
of
and
she
patronises
too
never
seen
her
do
not
know
how
the
world
stands
with
you
in
all
human
probability
i
shall
never
know
but
whatever
i
may
have
said
before
i
pray
for
sake
more
than
for
yours
that
all
may
be
well
i
have
learnt
what
misery
means
and
i
dare
not
wish
that
any
one
dear
to
you
should
share
my
knowledge
capt
good
god
ca
you
leave
that
letter
alone
or
at
least
ca

from
reading
it

going

the
meaning
of

the
best
squadron
of
the
best
regiment
of
the
best

enough
for
you

to

all
that
you

does
she
say
that
she
does
like

that
the
worst
of

she
wo
for
fear
of
leaving

what

much
gaddy

that
she
wants
england
and
the
would
be
all
the
better
for
it
i
going
to
chuck
you
do
understand
i
understand
one
hundred
and
new
horses
to
be
licked
into
shape
somehow
before
luck
comes
round
again
a
draft
who
give
more
trouble
than
the
horses
a
camp
next
cold
weather
for
a
certainty
ourselves
the
first
on
the
roster
the
russian
shindy
ready
to
come
to
a
head
at
five
minutes
notice
and
you
the
best
of
us
all
backing
out
of
it
all
think
a
little
gaddy
you
do
it
hang
it
a
man
has
some
duties
towards
his
family
i
suppose
i
remember
a
man
though
who
told
me
the
night
after
amdheran
when
we
were
picketed
under
jagai
and
he
left
his
sword
by
the
way
did
you
ever
pay
ranken
for
that
sword
in
an
utmanzai
head
that
man
told
me
that
he
stick
by
me
and
the
pinks
as
long
as
he
lived
i
blame
him
for
not
sticking
by
me
i
not
much
of
a
man
but
i
blame
him
for
not
sticking
by
the
pink
hussars
g
we
were
little
more
than
boys
then
ca
you
see
jack
how
things
stand
is
as
if
we
were
serving
for
our
bread
we
all
of
us
more
or
less
got
the
filthy
lucre
i
luckier
than
some
perhaps
there
no
for
me
to
serve
on
none
in
the
world
for
you
or
for
us
except
the
regimental
if
you
do
choose
to
answer
to
of
course
do
be
too
hard
on
a
man
you
know
that
a
lot
of
us
only
take
up
the
thing
for
a
few
years
and
then
go
back
to
town
and
catch
on
with
the
rest
not
lots
and
they
are
some
of
and
then
there
are
one
affairs
at
home
to
be
considered
my
place
and
the
rents
and
all
that
i
do
suppose
my
father
can
last
much
longer
and
that
means
the
title
and
so
on
you
wo
be
entered
in
the
stud
book
correctly
unless
you
go
home
take
six
months
then
and
come
out
in
october
if
i
could
slay
off
a
brother
or
two
i
i
should
be
a
marquis
of
sorts
any
fool
can
be
that
but
it
needs
gaddy
men
like
you
to
lead
flanking
squadrons
properly
do
you
delude
yourself
into
the
belief
that
you
going
home
to
take
your
place
and
prance
about
among
kabuli
dowagers
you
are
built
that
way
i
know
better
a
man
has
a
right
to
live
his
life
as
happily
as
he
can
married
no
praise
be
to
providence
and
the
one
or
two
women
who
have
had
the
good
sense
to
me
then
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
go
into
your
own
room
and
see
your
wife
head
on
the
pillow
and
when
everything
else
is
safe
and
the
house
shut
up
for
the
night
to
wonder
whether
the
wo
give
and
kill
her
m
revelations
first
and
second
i
knew
a
man
who
got
squiffy
at
our
mess
once
and
confided
to
me
that
he
never
helped
his
wife
on
to
her
horse
without
praying
that
she
break
her
neck
before
she
came
back
all
husbands
are
alike
you
see
what
on
earth
has
that
to
do
with
my
case
the
man
must
ha
been
mad
or
his
wife
as
bad
as
they
make
m
fault
of
yours
if
either
were
all
you
say
forgotten
the
tune
when
you
were
insane
about
the
herriott
woman
you
always
were
a
good
hand
at
forgetting
not
more
mad
than
men
who
go
to
the
other
extreme
be
reasonable
gaddy
your
are
sound
enough
that
was
only
a
way
of
speaking
i
been
uneasy
and
worried
about
the
wife
ever
since
that
awful
business
three
years
ago
when
i
nearly
lost
her
can
you
wonder
oh
a
shell
never
falls
twice
in
the
same
place
you
paid
your
toll
to
misfortune
why
should
your
wife
be
picked
out
more
than
anybody
else
i
can
just
as
reasonably
as
you
can
but
you
understand
you
do
understand
and
then
there
the
deuce
knows
where
the
ayah
takes
him
to
sit
in
the
evening
he
has
a
bit
of
a
cough
have
you
noticed
it
bosh
the
brigadier
jumping
out
of
his
skin
with
pure
condition
he
got
a
muzzle
like
a
and
the
chest
of
a
what
demoralised
you
funk
that
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
funk
but
what
there
to
funk
everything
it
ghastly
ah
i
see
you
do
want
to
fight
and
by
jingo
when
we
do
you
got
the
kid
you
got
the
wife
you
got
the
money
too
that
about
the
case
eh
i
suppose
that
it
but
it
not
for
myself
it
because
of
at
least
i
think
it
is
are
you
sure
looking
at
the
matter
in
a
light
the
wife
is
provided
for
even
if
you
were
wiped
out
she
has
an
ancestral
home
to
go
to
money
and
the
brigadier
to
carry
on
the
illustrious
name
then
it
is
for
myself
or
because
they
are
part
of
me
you
do
see
it
my
life
so
good
so
pleasant
as
it
is
that
i
want
to
make
it
quite
safe
ca
you
understand
perfectly
for
the
charger
as
they
say
in
the
line
and
i
have
everything
to
my
hand
to
make
it
so
i
sick
of
the
strain
and
the
worry
for
their
sakes
out
here
and
there
is
a
single
real
difficulty
to
prevent
my
dropping
it
altogether
it
only
cost
me
jack
i
hope
you
never
know
the
shame
that
i
been
going
through
for
the
past
six
months
hold
on
there
i
do
wish
to
be
told
every
man
has
his
moods
and
tenses
sometimes
has
he
what
do
you
call
craning
over
to
see
where
your
lands
in
my
case
it
means
that
i
have
been
on
the
considerable
bend
and
have
come
to
parade
with
a
head
and
a
hand
it
passes
in
three
strides
it
passes
with
me
jack
i
always
thinking
about
it
phil
gadsby
funking
a
fall
on
parade
sweet
picture
is
it
draw
it
for
me
m
heaven
forbid
a
man
like
you
ca
be
as
bad
as
that
a
fall
is
no
nice
thing
but
one
never
gives
it
a
thought
does
one
wait
till
you
got
a
wife
and
a
youngster
of
your
own
and
then
you
know
how
the
roar
of
the
squadron
behind
you
turns
you
cold
all
up
the
back
and
this
man
led
at
amdheran
after
went
under
and
we
were
all
mixed
up
together
and
he
came
out
of
the
show
dripping
like
a
butcher
skittles
the
men
can
always
open
out
and
you
can
always
pick
your
way
more
or
less
the
dust
to
bother
us
as
the
men
have
and
whoever
heard
of
a
horse
stepping
on
a
man
never
as
long
as
he
can
see
but
did
they
open
out
for
poor
errington
oh
this
is
childish
i
know
it
is
worse
than
that
i
do
care
you
ridden
van
loo
is
he
the
sort
of
brute
to
pick
his
way
when
we
coming
up
in
column
of
troop
with
any
pace
on
once
in
a
blue
moon
do
we
gallop
in
column
of
troop
and
then
only
to
save
time
are
three
lengths
enough
for
you
yes
quite
enough
they
just
allow
for
the
full
development
of
the
smash
i
talking
like
a
cur
i
know
but
i
tell
you
that
for
the
past
three
months
i
felt
every
hoof
of
the
squadron
in
the
small
of
my
back
every
time
that
i
led
but
gaddy
this
is
awful
is
it
lovely
is
it
royal
a
captain
of
the
pink
hussars
watering
up
his
charger
before
parade
like
the
blasted
boozing
colonel
of
a
black
regiment
you
never
did
once
only
he
squelched
like
a
and
the
cocked
his
eye
at
me
you
know
old
haffy
eye
i
was
afraid
to
do
it
again
i
should
think
so
that
was
the
best
way
to
rupture
old
van
tummy
and
make
him
crumple
you
up
you
that
i
did
care
it
took
the
edge
off
him
the
edge
off
him
gaddy
you
you
you
you
know
think
of
the
men
that
another
thing
i
am
afraid
of
they
know
let
hope
not
but
they
deadly
quick
to
spot
skrim
little
things
of
that
kind
see
here
old
man
send
the
wife
home
for
the
hot
weather
and
come
to
kashmir
with
me
we
start
a
boat
on
the
dal
or
cross
the
rhotang
shoot
ibex
or
loaf
which
you
please
only
you
a
bit
off
your
oats
and
you
talking
nonsense
look
at
the
colonel
rascal
that
he
is
he
has
a
wife
and
no
end
of
a
of
his
own
can
any
one
of
us
ride
round
him
and
all
i
ca
and
i
think
i
can
shove
a
crock
along
a
bit
some
men
are
different
i
have
the
nerve
lord
help
me
i
the
nerve
i
taken
up
a
hole
and
a
half
to
get
my
knees
well
under
the
wallets
i
ca
help
it
i
so
afraid
of
anything
happening
to
me
on
my
soul
i
ought
to
be
broke
in
front
of
the
squadron
for
cowardice
ugly
word
that
i
should
never
have
the
courage
to
own
up
i
meant
to
lie
about
my
reasons
when
i
began
but
i
got
out
of
the
habit
of
lying
to
you
old
man
jack
you
wo
but
i
know
you
wo
of
course
not
the
pinks
are
paying
dearly
for
their
pride
eh
do
you
know
the
men
have
called
gadsby
the
pride
of
the
pink
hussars
ever
since
she
came
to
us
is
fault
do
think
that
it
all
mine
what
does
she
say
i
have
exactly
put
it
before
her
she
the
best
little
woman
in
the
world
jack
and
all
that
but
she
would
counsel
a
man
to
stick
to
his
calling
if
it
came
between
him
and
her
at
least
i
think
never
mind
do
tell
her
what
you
told
me
go
on
the
peerage
and
tack
she
see
through
it
she
five
times
cleverer
than
i
am
then
she
accept
the
sacrifice
and
think
a
little
bit
worse
of
him
for
the
rest
of
her
days
i
say
do
you
despise
me
way
of
putting
it
have
you
ever
been
asked
that
question
think
a
minute
what
answer
used
you
to
give
so
bad
as
i
not
entitled
to
expect
anything
more
but
a
bit
hard
when
one
best
friend
turns
round
and
so
have
found
but
you
will
have
consolations
bailiffs
and
drains
and
liquid
manure
and
the
primrose
league
and
perhaps
if
you
lucky
the
colonelcy
of
a
yeomanry
regiment
all
uniform
and
no
riding
i
believe
how
old
are
you
i
know
it
at
forty
you
be
a
fool
of
a
landlord
at
fifty
you
own
a
and
the
brigadier
if
he
takes
after
you
will
be
fluttering
the
dovecotes
of
what
the
particular
dunghill
you
going
to
also
gadsby
will
be
fat
this
is
rather
more
than
a
joke
think
so
is
cutting
the
service
a
joke
it
generally
takes
a
man
fifty
years
to
arrive
at
it
you
quite
right
though
it
is
more
than
a
joke
you
managed
it
in
do
make
me
feel
worse
than
i
do
will
it
satisfy
you
if
i
own
that
i
am
a
shirker
a
and
a
coward
it
will
because
i
the
only
man
in
the
world
who
can
talk
to
you
like
this
without
being
knocked
down
you
must
take
all
that
said
to
heart
in
this
way
i
only
spoke
a
lot
of
it
at
least
out
of
pure
selfishness
because
because
oh
damn
it
all
old
man
i
know
i
shall
do
without
you
of
course
you
got
the
money
and
the
place
and
all
that
and
there
are
two
very
good
reasons
why
you
should
take
care
of
yourself
make
it
any
the
sweeter
i
backing
out
i
know
i
am
i
always
had
a
soft
drop
in
me
somewhere
and
i
dare
risk
any
danger
to
why
in
the
world
should
you
you
bound
to
think
of
your
family
bound
to
think
if
i
was
a
younger
son
i
go
too
be
shot
if
i
would
thank
you
jack
it
a
kind
lie
but
it
the
blackest
you
told
for
some
time
i
know
what
i
doing
and
i
going
into
it
with
my
eyes
open
old
man
i
help
it
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
in
my
place
conceive
any
woman
getting
permanently
between
me
and
the
regiment
say
likely
i
should
do
no
better
i
sorry
for
you
sorry
but
them
your
sentiments
i
believe
i
really
do
that
you
are
acting
wisely
do
you
i
hope
you
do
a
jack
be
very
sure
of
yourself
before
you
marry
i
an
ungrateful
ruffian
to
say
this
but
marriage
even
as
good
a
marriage
as
mine
has
been
hampers
a
work
it
cripples
his
and
oh
it
plays
hell
with
his
notions
of
duty
sometimes
good
and
sweet
as
she
is
sometimes
i
could
wish
that
i
had
kept
my
freedom
no
i
do
mean
that
exactly
down
the
what
are
you
wagging
your
head
over
pip
me
as
usual
the
old
sermon
your
husband
is
recommending
me
to
get
married
saw
such
a
man
well
why
do
you
i
daresay
you
would
make
some
woman
very
happy
there
the
law
and
the
prophets
jack
never
mind
the
regiment
make
a
woman
happy
o
lord
we
see
i
must
be
off
to
make
a
troop
cook
desperately
unhappy
i
wo
have
the
wily
hussar
fed
on
government
bullock
train
shinbones

broken
is
it
young
mafflin
did
at
all
like
his
watch
being
broken
though
he
was
too
polite
to
say
so
it
was
entirely
his
fault

the
moral

read
when
the
night
is
thick
and
the
tracks

blind
a

a
friend
indeed
but
a
fool
to
wait
for
the
laggard
behind

to
gehenna
or
up
to
the
throne
he
travels
the
fastest
who
travels
alone
white

red

tarnish
the
scabbarded

high

one

fall
but
he
falls
by

falls

may
attain
and
to
him

sun
my
feet
are
swollen
because
i
have
washed
them
in
bitter
water
and
my
cheeks
are
hollow
because
the
food
here
is
bad
fire
burn
your
money
what
do
i
want
with
it
i
am
rich
and
i
thought
you
were
my
friend
but
you
are
like
the
others
a
sahib
is
a
man
sad
give
him
money
say
the
sahibs
is
he
dishonoured
give
him
money
say
the
sahibs
hath
he
a
wrong
upon
his
head
give
him
money
say
the
sahibs
such
are
the
sahibs
and
such
art
thou
even
thou
nay
do
not
look
at
the
feet
of
the
dun
pity
it
is
that
i
ever
taught
you
to
know
the
legs
of
a
horse
footsore
be
it
so
what
of
that
the
roads
are
hard
and
the
mare
footsore
she
bears
a
double
burden
sahib
and
now
i
pray
you
give
me
permission
to
depart
great
favour
and
honour
has
the
sahib
done
me
and
graciously
has
he
shown
his
belief
that
the
horses
are
stolen
will
it
please
him
to
send
me
to
the
thana
to
call
a
sweeper
and
have
me
led
away
by
one
of
these
i
am
the
sahib
friend
i
have
drunk
water
in
the
shadow
of
his
house
and
he
has
blackened
my
face
remains
there
anything
more
to
do
will
the
sahib
give
me
eight
annas
to
make
smooth
the
injury
and
complete
the
insult
forgive
me
my
brother
i
knew
not
i
know
not
now
what
i
say
yes
i
lied
to
you
i
will
put
dust
on
my
head
and
i
am
an
afridi
the
horses
have
been
marched
footsore
from
the
valley
to
this
place
and
my
eyes
are
dim
and
my
body
aches
for
the
want
of
sleep
and
my
heart
is
dried
up
with
sorrow
and
shame
but
as
it
was
my
shame
so
by
god
the
dispenser
of
justice
by
it
shall
be
my
own
revenge
we
have
spoken
together
with
naked
hearts
before
this
and
our
hands
have
dipped
into
the
same
dish
and
thou
hast
been
to
me
as
a
brother
therefore
i
pay
thee
back
with
lies
and
ingratitude
as
a
pathan
listen
now
when
the
grief
of
the
soul
is
too
heavy
for
endurance
it
may
be
a
little
eased
by
speech
and
moreover
the
mind
of
a
true
man
is
as
a
well
and
the
pebble
of
confession
dropped
therein
sinks
and
is
no
more
seen
from
the
valley
have
i
come
on
foot
league
by
league
with
a
fire
in
my
chest
like
the
fire
of
the
pit
and
why
hast
thou
then
so
quickly
forgotten
our
customs
among
this
folk
who
sell
their
wives
and
their
daughters
for
silver
come
back
with
me
to
the
north
and
be
among
men
once
more
come
back
when
this
matter
is
accomplished
and
i
call
for
thee
the
bloom
of
the
is
upon
all
the
valley
and
is
only
dust
and
a
great
stink
there
is
a
pleasant
wind
among
the
mulberry
trees
and
the
streams
are
bright
with
and
the
caravans
go
up
and
the
caravans
go
down
and
a
hundred
fires
sparkle
in
the
gut
of
the
pass
and
answers
and
squeals
to
across
the
drift
smoke
of
the
evening
it
is
good
in
the
north
now
come
back
with
me
let
us
return
to
our
own
people
come
whence
is
my
sorrow
does
a
man
tear
out
his
heart
and
make
fritters
thereof
over
a
slow
fire
for
aught
other
than
a
woman
do
not
laugh
friend
of
mine
for
your
time
will
also
be
a
woman
of
the
abazai
was
she
and
i
took
her
to
wife
to
staunch
the
feud
between
our
village
and
the
men
of
ghor
i
am
no
longer
young
the
lime
has
touched
my
beard
true
i
had
no
need
of
the
wedding
nay
but
i
loved
her
what
saith
rahman
whose
heart
love
enters
there
is
folly
naught
by
a
glance
of
the
eye
she
hath
blinded
thee
and
by
the
eyelids
and
the
fringe
of
the
eyelids
taken
thee
into
the
captivity
without
ransom
naught
dost
thou
remember
that
song
at
the
in
the
pindi
camp
among
the
uzbegs
of
the
amir
the
abazai
are
dogs
and
their
women
the
servants
of
sin
there
was
a
lover
of
her
own
people
but
of
that
her
father
told
me
naught
my
friend
curse
for
me
in
your
prayers
as
i
curse
at
each
praying
from
the
fakr
to
the
isha
the
name
of
daoud
shah
abazai
whose
head
is
still
upon
his
neck
whose
hands
are
still
upon
his
wrists
who
has
done
me
dishonour
who
has
made
my
name
a
among
the
women
of
little
malikand
i
went
into
hindustan
at
the
end
of
two
months
to
cherat
i
was
gone
twelve
days
only
but
i
had
said
that
i
would
be
fifteen
days
absent
this
i
did
to
try
her
for
it
is
written
not
the
incapable
coming
up
the
gorge
alone
in
the
falling
of
the
light
i
heard
the
voice
of
a
man
singing
at
the
door
of
my
house
and
it
was
the
voice
of
daoud
shah
and
the
song
that
he
sang
was
wara
yow
three
are
one
it
was
as
though
a
heelrope
had
been
slipped
round
my
heart
and
all
the
devils
were
drawing
it
tight
past
endurance
i
crept
silently
up
the
but
the
fuse
of
my
matchlock
was
wetted
with
the
rain
and
i
could
not
slay
daoud
shah
from
afar
moreover
it
was
in
my
mind
to
kill
the
woman
also
thus
he
sang
sitting
outside
my
house
and
anon
the
woman
opened
the
door
and
i
came
nearer
crawling
on
my
belly
among
the
rocks
i
had
only
my
knife
to
my
hand
but
a
stone
slipped
under
my
foot
and
the
two
looked
down
the
hillside
and
he
leaving
his
matchlock
fled
from
my
anger
because
he
was
afraid
for
the
life
that
was
in
him
but
the
woman
moved
not
till
i
stood
in
front
of
her
crying
woman
what
is
this
that
thou
hast
done
and
she
void
of
fear
though
she
knew
my
thought
laughed
saying
is
a
little
thing
i
loved
him
and
art
a
dog
and
coming
by
night
strike
and
i
being
still
blinded
by
her
beauty
for
o
my
friend
the
women
of
the
abazai
are
very
fair
said
thou
no
fear
and
she
answered
but
only
the
fear
that
i
do
not
die
then
said
i
no
fear
and
she
bowed
her
head
and
i
smote
it
off
at
the
so
that
it
leaped
between
my
feet
thereafter
the
rage
of
our
people
came
upon
me
and
i
hacked
off
the
breasts
that
the
men
of
little
malikand
might
know
the
crime
and
cast
the
body
into
the
that
flows
to
the
kabul
river
wara
yow
dee
dray
wara
yow
dee
the
body
without
the
head
the
soul
without
light
and
my
own
darkling
heart
all
three
are
one
all
three
are
one
that
night
making
no
halt
i
went
to
ghor
and
demanded
news
of
daoud
shah
men
said
is
gone
to
pubbi
for
horses
what
wouldst
thou
of
him
there
is
peace
between
the
villages
i
made
answer
the
peace
of
treachery
and
the
love
that
the
devil
atala
bore
to
gurel
so
i
fired
thrice
into
the
gate
and
laughed
and
went
my
way
in
those
hours
brother
and
friend
of
my
heart
heart
the
moon
and
the
stars
were
as
blood
above
me
and
in
my
mouth
was
the
taste
of
dry
earth
also
i
broke
no
bread
and
my
drink
was
the
rain
of
the
valley
of
ghor
upon
my
face
at
pubbi
i
found
mahbub
ali
the
writer
sitting
upon
his
charpoy
and
gave
up
my
arms
according
to
your
law
but
i
was
not
grieved
for
it
was
in
my
heart
that
i
should
kill
daoud
shah
with
my
bare
hands
thus
as
a
man
strips
a
bunch
of
raisins
mahbub
ali
said
shah
has
even
now
gone
to
peshawur
and
he
will
pick
up
his
horses
upon
the
road
to
delhi
for
it
is
said
that
the
bombay
tramway
company
are
buying
horses
there
by
the
eight
horses
to
the
truck
and
that
was
a
true
saying
then
i
saw
that
the
hunting
would
be
no
little
thing
for
the
man
was
gone
into
your
borders
to
save
himself
against
my
wrath
and
shall
he
save
himself
so
am
i
not
alive
though
he
run
northward
to
the
dora
and
the
snow
or
southerly
to
the
black
water
i
will
follow
him
as
a
lover
follows
the
footsteps
of
his
mistress
and
coming
upon
him
i
will
take
him
tenderly
aho
so
tenderly
in
my
arms
saying
hast
thou
done
and
well
shalt
thou
be
repaid
and
out
of
that
embrace
daoud
shah
shall
not
go
forth
with
the
breath
in
his
nostrils
where
is
the
pitcher
i
am
as
thirsty
as
a
in
the
first
month
your
law
what
is
your
law
to
me
when
the
horses
fight
on
the
runs
do
they
regard
the
boundary
pillars
or
do
the
kites
of
ali
musjid
forbear
because
the
carrion
lies
under
the
shadow
of
ghor
kuttri
the
matter
began
across
the
border
it
shall
finish
where
god
pleases
here
in
my
own
country
or
in
hell
all
three
are
one
listen
now
sharer
of
the
sorrow
of
my
heart
and
i
will
tell
of
the
hunting
i
followed
to
peshawur
from
pubbi
and
i
went
to
and
fro
about
the
streets
of
peshawur
like
a
houseless
dog
seeking
for
my
enemy
once
i
thought
i
saw
him
washing
his
mouth
in
the
conduit
in
the
big
square
but
when
i
came
up
he
was
gone
it
may
be
that
it
was
he
and
seeing
my
face
he
had
fled
a
girl
of
the
bazar
said
that
he
would
go
to
nowshera
i
said
heart
heart
does
daoud
shah
visit
thee
and
she
said
so
i
said
would
fain
see
him
for
we
be
friends
parted
for
two
years
hide
me
i
pray
here
in
the
shadow
of
the
window
shutter
and
i
will
wait
for
his
coming
and
the
girl
said
pathan
look
into
my
eyes
and
i
turned
leaning
upon
her
breast
and
looked
into
her
eyes
swearing
that
i
spoke
the
very
truth
of
god
but
she
answered
friend
waited
friend
with
such
eyes
lie
to
god
and
the
prophet
but
to
a
woman
ye
can
not
lie
get
hence
there
shall
be
no
harm
befall
daoud
shah
by
cause
of
me
i
would
have
strangled
that
girl
but
for
the
fear
of
your
police
and
thus
the
hunting
would
have
come
to
naught
therefore
i
only
laughed
and
departed
and
she
leaned
over
the
in
the
night
and
mocked
me
down
the
street
her
name
is
jamun
when
i
have
made
my
account
with
the
man
i
will
return
to
peshawur
and
her
lovers
shall
desire
her
no
more
for
her
beauty
sake
she
shall
not
be
but
the
cripple
among
trees
ho
ho
shall
she
be
at
peshawur
i
bought
the
horses
and
grapes
and
the
almonds
and
dried
fruits
that
the
reason
of
my
wanderings
might
be
open
to
the
government
and
that
there
might
be
no
hindrance
upon
the
road
but
when
i
came
to
nowshera
he
was
gone
and
i
knew
not
where
to
go
i
stayed
one
day
at
nowshera
and
in
the
night
a
voice
spoke
in
my
ears
as
i
slept
among
the
horses
all
night
it
flew
round
my
head
and
would
not
cease
from
whispering
i
was
upon
my
belly
sleeping
as
the
devils
sleep
and
it
may
have
been
that
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
a
devil
it
said
south
and
thou
shalt
come
upon
daoud
shah
listen
my
brother
and
chiefest
among
friends
listen
is
the
tale
a
long
one
think
how
it
was
long
to
me
i
have
trodden
every
league
of
the
road
from
pubbi
to
this
place
and
from
nowshera
my
guide
was
only
the
voice
and
the
lust
of
vengeance
to
the
uttock
i
went
but
that
was
no
hindrance
to
me
ho
ho
a
man
may
turn
the
word
twice
even
in
his
trouble
the
uttock
was
no
obstacle
to
me
and
i
heard
the
voice
above
the
noise
of
the
waters
beating
on
the
big
rock
saying
to
the
right
so
i
went
to
pindigheb
and
in
those
days
my
sleep
was
taken
from
me
utterly
and
the
head
of
the
woman
of
the
abazai
was
before
me
night
and
day
even
as
it
had
fallen
between
my
feet
wara
yow
dee
dray
wara
yow
dee
fire
ashes
and
my
couch
all
three
are
one
all
three
are
one
now
i
was
far
from
the
winter
path
of
the
dealers
who
had
gone
to
sialkot
and
so
south
by
the
rail
and
the
big
road
to
the
line
of
cantonments
but
there
was
a
sahib
in
camp
at
pindigheb
who
bought
from
me
a
white
mare
at
a
good
price
and
told
me
that
one
daoud
shah
had
passed
to
shahpur
with
horses
then
i
saw
that
the
warning
of
the
voice
was
true
and
made
swift
to
come
to
the
salt
hills
the
jhelum
was
in
flood
but
i
could
not
wait
and
in
the
crossing
a
bay
stallion
was
washed
down
and
drowned
herein
was
god
hard
to
me
not
in
respect
of
the
beast
of
that
i
had
no
care
but
in
this
snatching
while
i
was
upon
the
right
bank
urging
the
horses
into
the
water
daoud
shah
was
upon
the
left
for
alghias
the
hoofs
of
my
mare
scattered
the
hot
ashes
of
his
fires
when
we
came
up
the
hither
bank
in
the
light
of
morning
but
he
had
fled
his
feet
were
made
swift
by
the
terror
of
death
and
i
went
south
from
shahpur
as
the
kite
flies
i
dared
not
turn
aside
lest
i
should
miss
my
vengeance
which
is
my
right
from
shahpur
i
skirted
by
the
jhelum
for
i
thought
that
he
would
avoid
the
desert
of
the
rechna
but
presently
at
sahiwal
i
turned
away
upon
the
road
to
jhang
samundri
and
gugera
till
upon
a
night
the
mottled
mare
breasted
the
fence
of
the
rail
that
turns
to
montgomery
and
that
place
was
okara
and
the
head
of
the
woman
of
the
abazai
lay
upon
the
sand
between
my
feet
thence
i
went
to
fazilka
and
they
said
that
i
was
mad
to
bring
starved
horses
there
the
voice
was
with
me
and
i
was
mad
but
only
wearied
because
i
could
not
find
daoud
shah
it
was
written
that
i
should
not
find
him
at
rania
nor
bahadurgarh
and
i
came
into
delhi
from
the
west
and
there
also
i
found
him
not
my
friend
i
have
seen
many
strange
things
in
my
wanderings
i
have
seen
devils
rioting
across
the
rechna
as
the
stallions
riot
in
spring
i
have
heard
the
calling
to
each
other
from
holes
in
the
sand
and
i
have
seen
them
pass
before
my
face
there
are
no
devils
say
the
sahibs
they
are
very
wise
but
they
do
not
know
all
things
about
devils
or
horses
ho
ho
i
say
to
you
who
are
laughing
at
my
misery
that
i
have
seen
the
devils
at
high
noon
whooping
and
leaping
on
the
shoals
of
the
chenab
and
was
i
afraid
my
brother
when
the
desire
of
a
man
is
set
upon
one
thing
alone
he
fears
neither
god
nor
man
nor
devil
if
my
vengeance
failed
i
would
splinter
the
gates
of
paradise
with
the
butt
of
my
gun
or
i
would
cut
my
way
into
hell
with
my
knife
and
i
would
call
upon
those
who
govern
there
for
the
body
of
daoud
shah
what
love
so
deep
as
hate
do
not
speak
i
know
the
thought
in
your
heart
is
the
white
of
this
eye
clouded
how
does
the
blood
beat
at
the
wrist
there
is
no
madness
in
my
flesh
but
only
the
vehemence
of
the
desire
that
has
eaten
me
up
listen
south
of
delhi
i
knew
not
the
country
at
all
therefore
i
can
not
say
where
i
went
but
i
passed
through
many
cities
i
knew
only
that
it
was
laid
upon
me
to
go
south
when
the
horses
could
march
no
more
i
threw
myself
upon
the
earth
and
waited
till
the
day
there
was
no
sleep
with
me
in
that
journeying
and
that
was
a
heavy
burden
dost
thou
know
brother
of
mine
the
evil
of
wakefulness
that
can
not
break
when
the
bones
are
sore
for
lack
of
sleep
and
the
skin
of
the
temples
twitches
with
weariness
and
yet
there
is
no
sleep
there
is
no
sleep
wara
yow
dee
dray
wara
yow
dee
the
eye
of
the
sun
the
eye
of
the
moon
and
my
own
unrestful
eyes
all
three
are
one
all
three
are
one
there
was
a
city
the
name
whereof
i
have
forgotten
and
there
the
voice
called
all
night
that
was
ten
days
ago
it
has
cheated
me
afresh
i
have
come
hither
from
a
place
called
hamirpur
and
behold
it
is
my
fate
that
i
should
meet
with
thee
to
my
comfort
and
the
increase
of
friendship
this
is
a
good
omen
by
the
joy
of
looking
upon
thy
face
the
weariness
has
gone
from
my
feet
and
the
sorrow
of
my
so
long
travel
is
forgotten
also
my
heart
is
peaceful
for
i
know
that
the
end
is
near
it
may
be
that
i
shall
find
daoud
shah
in
this
city
going
northward
since
a
hillman
will
ever
head
back
to
his
hills
when
the
spring
warns
and
shall
he
see
those
hills
of
our
country
surely
i
shall
overtake
him
surely
my
vengeance
is
safe
surely
god
hath
him
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
against
my
claiming
there
shall
no
harm
befall
daoud
shah
till
i
come
for
i
would
fain
kill
him
quick
and
whole
with
the
life
sticking
firm
in
his
body
a
pomegranate
is
sweetest
when
the
cloves
break
away
unwilling
from
the
rind
let
it
be
in
the
daytime
that
i
may
see
his
face
and
my
delight
may
be
crowned
and
when
i
have
accomplished
the
matter
and
my
honour
is
made
clean
i
shall
return
thanks
unto
god
the
holder
of
the
scale
of
the
law
and
i
shall
sleep
from
the
night
through
the
day
and
into
the
night
again
i
shall
sleep
and
no
dream
shall
trouble
me
and
now
o
my
brother
the
tale
is
all
told
ahi
ahi
alghias
ahi
the
judgment
of
dungara
see
the
pale
martyr
with
his
shirt
on
they
tell
the
tale
even
now
among
the
groves
of
the
berbulda
hill
and
for
corroboration
point
to
the
roofless
and
windowless
the
great
god
dungara
the
god
of
things
as
they
are
most
terrible
bearing
the
red
elephant
tusk
did
it
all
and
he
who
refuses
to
believe
in
dungara
will
assuredly
be
smitten
by
the
madness
of
yat
the
madness
that
fell
upon
the
sons
and
the
daughters
of
the
buria
kol
when
they
turned
aside
from
dungara
and
put
on
clothes
so
says
athon
who
is
high
priest
of
the
shrine
and
warden
of
the
red
elephant
tusk
but
if
you
ask
the
assistant
collector
and
agent
in
charge
of
the
buria
kol
he
will
laugh
not
because
he
bears
any
malice
against
missions
but
because
he
himself
saw
the
vengeance
of
dungara
executed
upon
the
spiritual
children
of
the
reverend
justus
krenk
pastor
of
the
tubingen
mission
and
upon
lotta
his
virtuous
wife
note
the
e
in
athon
daze
has
an
acute
accent
yet
if
ever
a
man
merited
good
treatment
of
the
gods
it
was
the
reverend
justus
one
time
of
heidelberg
who
on
the
faith
of
a
call
went
into
the
wilderness
and
took
the
blonde
lotta
with
him
will
these
heathen
now
by
idolatrous
practices
so
darkened
better
make
said
justus
in
the
early
days
of
his
career
he
added
with
conviction
shall
be
good
and
shall
with
their
hands
to
work
learn
for
all
good
christians
must
work
and
upon
a
stipend
more
modest
even
than
that
of
an
english
justus
krenk
kept
house
beyond
kamala
and
the
gorge
of
malair
beyond
the
berbulda
river
close
to
the
foot
of
the
blue
hill
of
panth
on
whose
summit
stands
the
temple
of
dungara
in
the
heart
of
the
country
of
the
buria
kol
the
naked
timid
shameless
lazy
buria
kol
do
you
know
what
life
at
a
mission
outpost
means
try
to
imagine
a
loneliness
exceeding
that
of
the
smallest
station
to
which
government
has
ever
sent
you
isolation
that
weighs
upon
the
waking
eyelids
and
drives
you
by
force
headlong
into
the
labours
of
the
day
there
is
no
post
there
is
no
one
of
your
own
colour
to
speak
to
there
are
no
roads
there
is
indeed
food
to
keep
you
alive
but
it
is
not
pleasant
to
eat
and
whatever
of
good
or
beauty
or
interest
there
is
in
your
life
must
come
from
yourself
and
the
grace
that
may
be
planted
in
you
in
the
morning
with
a
patter
of
soft
feet
the
converts
the
doubtful
and
the
open
scoffers
troop
up
to
the
veranda
you
must
be
infinitely
kind
and
patient
and
above
all
for
you
deal
with
the
simplicity
of
childhood
the
experience
of
man
and
the
subtlety
of
the
savage
your
congregation
have
a
hundred
material
wants
to
be
considered
and
it
is
for
you
as
you
believe
in
your
personal
responsibility
to
your
maker
to
pick
out
of
the
clamouring
crowd
any
grain
of
spirituality
that
may
lie
therein
if
to
the
cure
of
souls
you
add
that
of
bodies
your
task
will
be
all
the
more
difficult
for
the
sick
and
the
maimed
will
profess
any
and
every
creed
for
the
sake
of
healing
and
will
laugh
at
you
because
you
are
simple
enough
to
believe
them
as
the
day
wears
and
the
impetus
of
the
morning
dies
away
there
will
come
upon
you
an
overwhelming
sense
of
the
uselessness
of
your
toil
this
must
be
striven
against
and
the
only
spur
in
your
side
will
be
the
belief
that
you
are
playing
against
the
devil
for
the
living
soul
it
is
a
great
a
joyous
belief
but
he
who
can
hold
it
unwavering
for
four
and
twenty
consecutive
hours
must
be
blessed
with
an
abundantly
strong
physique
and
equable
nerve
ask
the
gray
heads
of
the
bannockburn
medical
crusade
what
manner
of
life
their
preachers
lead
speak
to
the
racine
gospel
agency
those
lean
americans
whose
boast
is
that
they
go
where
no
englishman
dare
follow
get
a
pastor
of
the
tubingen
mission
to
talk
of
his
experiences
if
you
can
you
will
be
referred
to
the
printed
reports
but
these
contain
no
mention
of
the
men
who
have
lost
youth
and
health
all
that
a
man
may
lose
except
faith
in
the
wilds
of
english
maidens
who
have
gone
forth
and
died
in
the
jungle
of
the
panth
hills
knowing
from
the
first
that
death
was
almost
a
certainty
few
pastors
will
tell
you
of
these
things
any
more
than
they
will
speak
of
that
young
david
of
st
bees
who
set
apart
for
the
lord
work
broke
down
in
utter
desolation
and
returned
half
distraught
to
the
head
mission
crying
is
no
god
but
i
have
walked
with
the
devil
the
reports
are
silent
here
because
heroism
failure
doubt
despair
and
on
the
part
of
a
mere
cultured
white
man
are
things
of
no
weight
as
compared
to
the
saving
of
one
soul
from
a
fantastic
faith
in
goblins
of
the
rock
and
and
gallio
the
assistant
collector
of
the
country
side
for
none
of
these
things
he
had
been
long
in
the
district
and
the
buria
kol
loved
him
and
brought
him
offerings
of
speared
fish
orchids
from
the
dim
moist
heart
of
the
forests
and
as
much
game
as
he
could
eat
in
return
he
gave
them
quinine
and
with
athon
daze
the
high
priest
controlled
their
simple
policies
you
have
been
some
years
in
the
country
said
gallio
at
the
krenks
table
grow
to
find
one
creed
as
good
as
another
i
give
you
all
the
assistance
in
my
power
of
course
but
do
hurt
my
buria
kol
they
are
a
good
people
and
they
trust
me
will
them
the
word
of
the
lord
teach
said
justus
his
round
face
beaming
with
enthusiasm
i
will
assuredly
to
their
prejudices
no
wrong
hastily
without
thinking
make
but
o
my
friend
this
in
the
mind
is
very
bad
said
gallio
have
their
bodies
and
the
district
to
see
to
but
you
can
try
what
you
can
do
for
their
souls
only
do
behave
as
your
predecessor
did
or
i
afraid
that
i
ca
guarantee
your
life
that
said
lotta
sturdily
handing
him
a
cup
of
tea
went
up
to
the
temple
of
dungara
to
be
sure
he
was
new
to
the
country
and
began
hammering
old
dungara
over
the
head
with
an
umbrella
so
the
buria
kol
turned
out
and
hammered
him
rather
savagely
i
was
in
the
district
and
he
sent
a
runner
to
me
with
a
note
saying
persecuted
for
the
lord
sake
send
wing
of
the
nearest
troops
were
about
two
hundred
miles
off
but
i
guessed
what
he
had
been
doing
i
rode
to
panth
and
talked
to
old
athon
daze
like
a
father
telling
him
that
a
man
of
his
wisdom
ought
to
have
known
that
the
sahib
had
sunstroke
and
was
mad
you
never
saw
a
people
more
sorry
in
your
life
athon
daze
apologised
sent
wood
and
milk
and
fowls
and
all
sorts
of
things
and
i
gave
five
rupees
to
the
shrine
and
told
macnamara
that
he
had
been
injudicious
he
said
that
i
had
bowed
down
in
the
house
of
rimmon
but
if
he
had
only
just
gone
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
insulted
palin
deo
the
idol
of
the
suria
kol
he
would
have
been
impaled
on
a
charred
bamboo
long
before
i
could
have
done
anything
and
then
i
should
have
had
to
have
hanged
some
of
the
poor
brutes
be
gentle
with
them
padri
but
i
do
think
you
do
much
i
said
justus
my
master
we
will
with
the
little
children
begin
many
of
them
will
be
sick
that
is
so
after
the
children
the
mothers
and
then
the
men
but
i
would
greatly
that
you
were
in
internal
sympathies
with
us
prefer
gallio
departed
to
risk
his
life
in
mending
the
rotten
bamboo
bridges
of
his
people
in
killing
a
too
persistent
tiger
here
or
there
in
sleeping
out
in
the
reeking
jungle
or
in
tracking
the
suria
kol
raiders
who
had
taken
a
few
heads
from
their
brethren
of
the
buria
clan
he
was
a
shambling
young
man
naturally
devoid
of
creed
or
reverence
with
a
longing
for
absolute
power
which
his
undesirable
district
gratified
one
wants
my
post
he
used
to
say
grimly
my
collector
only
pokes
his
nose
in
when
he
quite
certain
that
there
is
no
fever
monarch
of
all
i
survey
and
athon
daze
is
my
viceroy
because
gallio
prided
himself
on
his
supreme
disregard
of
human
life
though
he
never
extended
the
theory
beyond
his
own
he
naturally
rode
forty
miles
to
the
mission
with
a
tiny
brown
on
his
is
something
for
you
padri
said
he
kols
leave
their
surplus
children
to
die
see
why
they
should
but
you
may
rear
this
one
i
picked
it
up
beyond
the
berbulda
fork
i
a
notion
that
the
mother
has
been
following
me
through
the
woods
ever
since
is
the
first
of
the
fold
said
justus
and
lotta
caught
up
the
screaming
morsel
to
her
bosom
and
hushed
it
craftily
while
as
a
wolf
hangs
in
the
field
matui
who
had
borne
it
and
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
her
tribe
had
exposed
it
to
die
panted
weary
and
footsore
in
the
watching
the
house
with
hungry
what
would
the
omnipotent
assistant
collector
do
would
the
little
man
in
the
black
coat
eat
her
daughter
alive
as
athon
daze
said
was
the
custom
of
all
men
in
black
coats
matui
waited
among
the
bamboos
through
the
long
night
and
in
the
morning
there
came
forth
a
fair
white
woman
the
like
of
whom
matui
had
never
seen
and
in
her
arms
was
matui
daughter
clad
in
spotless
raiment
lotta
knew
little
of
the
tongue
of
the
buria
kol
but
when
mother
calls
to
mother
speech
is
easy
to
follow
by
the
hands
stretched
timidly
to
the
hem
of
her
gown
by
the
passionate
gutturals
and
the
longing
eyes
lotta
understood
with
whom
she
had
to
deal
so
matui
took
her
child
again
would
be
a
servant
even
a
slave
to
this
wonderful
white
woman
for
her
own
tribe
would
recognise
her
no
more
and
lotta
wept
with
her
exhaustively
after
the
german
fashion
which
includes
much
blowing
of
the
nose
the
child
then
the
mother
and
last
the
man
and
to
the
glory
of
god
all
said
justus
the
hopeful
and
the
man
came
with
a
bow
and
arrows
very
angry
indeed
for
there
was
no
one
to
cook
for
him
but
the
tale
of
the
mission
is
a
long
one
and
i
have
no
space
to
show
how
justus
forgetful
of
his
injudicious
predecessor
grievously
smote
moto
the
husband
of
matui
for
his
brutality
how
moto
was
startled
but
being
released
from
the
fear
of
instant
death
took
heart
and
became
the
faithful
ally
and
first
convert
of
justus
how
the
little
gathering
grew
to
the
huge
disgust
of
athon
daze
how
the
priest
of
the
god
of
things
as
they
are
argued
subtilely
with
the
priest
of
the
god
of
things
as
they
should
be
and
was
worsted
how
the
dues
of
the
temple
of
dungara
fell
away
in
fowls
and
fish
and
honeycomb
how
lotta
lightened
the
curse
of
eve
among
the
women
and
how
justus
did
his
best
to
introduce
the
curse
of
adam
how
the
buria
kol
rebelled
at
this
saying
that
their
god
was
an
idle
god
and
how
justus
partially
overcame
their
scruples
against
work
and
taught
them
that
the
black
earth
was
rich
in
other
produce
than
only
all
these
things
belong
to
the
history
of
many
months
and
throughout
those
months
the
athon
daze
meditated
revenge
for
the
tribal
neglect
of
dungara
with
savage
cunning
he
feigned
friendship
towards
justus
even
hinting
at
his
own
conversion
but
to
the
congregation
of
dungara
he
said
darkly
of
the
padri
flock
have
put
on
clothes
and
worship
a
busy
god
therefore
dungara
will
afflict
them
grieviously
till
they
throw
themselves
howling
into
the
waters
of
the
berbulda
at
night
the
red
elephant
tusk
boomed
and
groaned
among
the
hills
and
the
faithful
waked
and
said
god
of
things
as
they
are
matures
revenge
against
the
backsliders
be
merciful
dungara
to
us
thy
children
and
give
us
all
their
crops
late
in
the
cold
weather
the
collector
and
his
wife
came
into
the
buria
kol
country
and
look
at
krenk
mission
said
gallio
is
doing
good
work
in
his
own
way
and
i
think
he
be
pleased
if
you
opened
the
bamboo
chapel
that
he
has
managed
to
run
up
at
any
rate
you
see
a
civilised
buria
kol
great
was
the
stir
in
the
mission
he
and
the
gracious
lady
will
that
we
have
done
good
work
with
their
own
eyes
see
and
yes
we
will
him
our
converts
in
all
their
new
clothes
by
their
own
hands
constructed
exhibit
it
will
a
great
day
be
for
the
lord
always
said
justus
and
lotta
said
justus
had
in
his
quiet
way
felt
jealous
of
the
basel
weaving
mission
his
own
converts
being
unhandy
but
athon
daze
had
latterly
induced
some
of
them
to
hackle
the
glossy
silky
fibres
of
a
plant
that
grew
plenteously
on
the
panth
hills
it
yielded
a
cloth
white
and
smooth
almost
as
the
tappa
of
the
south
seas
and
that
day
the
converts
were
to
wear
for
the
first
time
clothes
made
therefrom
justus
was
proud
of
his
work
shall
in
white
clothes
clothed
to
meet
the
collector
and
his
lady
come
down
singing
now
thank
we
all
our
then
he
will
the
chapel
open
and
yes
even
gallio
to
believe
will
begin
stand
so
my
children
two
by
two
and
lotta
why
do
they
thus
themselves
bescratch
it
is
not
seemly
to
wriggle
nala
my
child
the
collector
will
be
here
and
be
pained
the
collector
his
wife
and
gallio
climbed
the
hill
to
the
the
converts
were
drawn
up
in
two
lines
a
shining
band
nearly
forty
strong
said
the
collector
whose
acquisitive
bent
of
mind
led
him
to
believe
that
he
had
fostered
the
institution
from
the
first
i
see
by
leaps
and
bounds
never
was
truer
word
spoken
the
mission
advancing
exactly
as
he
had
said
at
first
by
little
hops
and
shuffles
of
shamefaced
uneasiness
but
soon
by
the
leaps
of
horses
and
the
bounds
of
maddened
kangaroos
from
the
hill
of
panth
the
red
elephant
tusk
delivered
a
dry
and
anguished
blare
the
ranks
of
the
converts
wavered
broke
and
scattered
with
yells
and
shrieks
of
pain
while
justus
and
lotta
stood
is
the
judgment
of
dungara
shouted
a
voice
burn
i
burn
to
the
river
or
we
die
the
mob
wheeled
and
headed
for
the
rocks
that
the
berbulda
writhing
stamping
twisting
and
shedding
its
garments
as
it
ran
pursued
by
the
thunder
of
the
trumpet
of
dungara
justus
and
lotta
fled
to
the
collector
almost
in
tears
can
not
understand
yesterday
panted
justus
had
the
ten
what
is
this
praise
the
lord
all
good
spirits
by
land
and
by
sea
nala
oh
shame
with
a
bound
and
a
scream
there
alighted
on
the
rocks
above
their
heads
nala
once
the
pride
of
the
mission
a
maiden
of
fourteen
summers
good
docile
and
virtuous
now
naked
as
the
dawn
and
spitting
like
a
it
for
this
she
raved
hurling
her
petticoat
at
justus
it
for
this
i
left
my
people
and
dungara
for
the
fires
of
your
bad
place
blind
ape
little
earthworm
dried
fish
that
you
are
you
said
that
i
should
never
burn
o
dungara
i
burn
now
i
burn
now
have
mercy
god
of
things
as
they
are
she
turned
and
flung
herself
into
the
berbulda
and
the
trumpet
of
dungara
bellowed
jubilantly
the
last
of
the
converts
of
the
tubingen
mission
had
put
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
rapid
river
between
herself
and
her
teachers
gulped
justus
taught
in
the
school
a
b
c
oh
it
is
the
work
of
satan
but
gallio
was
curiously
regarding
the
maiden
petticoat
where
it
had
fallen
at
his
feet
he
felt
its
texture
drew
back
his
beyond
the
deep
tan
of
his
wrist
and
pressed
a
fold
of
the
cloth
against
the
flesh
a
blotch
of
angry
red
rose
on
the
white
skin
said
gallio
calmly
thought
so
is
it
said
justus
should
call
it
the
shirt
of
nessus
but
where
did
you
get
the
fibre
of
this
cloth
from
daze
said
justus
showed
the
boys
how
it
should
manufactured
be
old
fox
do
you
know
that
he
has
given
you
the
nilgiri
nettle
scorpion
to
work
up
no
wonder
they
squirmed
why
it
stings
even
when
they
make
of
it
unless
it
soaked
for
six
weeks
the
cunning
brute
it
would
take
about
half
an
hour
to
burn
through
their
thick
hides
and
then
gallio
burst
into
laughter
but
lotta
was
weeping
in
the
arms
of
the
collector
wife
and
justus
had
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
heterophylla
repeated
gallio
why
you
tell
me
i
could
have
saved
you
this
woven
fire
anybody
but
a
naked
kol
would
have
known
it
and
if
i
a
judge
of
their
ways
you
never
get
them
back
he
looked
across
the
river
to
where
the
converts
were
still
wallowing
and
wailing
in
the
shallows
and
the
laughter
died
out
of
his
eyes
for
he
saw
that
the
tubingen
mission
to
the
buria
kol
was
dead
never
again
though
they
hung
mournfully
round
the
deserted
school
for
three
months
could
lotta
or
justus
coax
back
even
the
most
promising
of
their
flock
no
the
end
of
conversion
was
the
fire
of
the
bad
place
fire
that
ran
through
the
limbs
and
gnawed
into
the
bones
who
dare
a
second
time
tempt
the
anger
of
dungara
let
the
little
man
and
his
wife
go
elsewhere
the
buria
kol
would
have
none
of
them
an
unofficial
message
to
athon
daze
that
if
a
hair
of
their
heads
were
touched
athon
daze
and
the
priests
of
dungara
would
be
hanged
by
gallio
at
the
temple
shrine
protected
justus
and
lotta
from
the
stumpy
poisoned
arrows
of
the
buria
kol
but
neither
fish
nor
fowl
honeycomb
salt
nor
young
pig
were
brought
to
their
doors
any
more
and
alas
man
can
not
live
by
grace
alone
if
meat
be
wanting
us
go
mine
wife
said
justus
is
no
good
here
and
the
lord
has
willed
that
some
other
man
shall
the
work
take
in
good
time
in
his
own
good
time
we
will
go
away
and
i
will
yes
some
botany
bestudy
if
any
one
is
anxious
to
convert
the
buria
kol
afresh
there
lies
at
least
the
core
of
a
under
the
hill
of
panth
but
the
chapel
and
school
have
long
since
fallen
back
into
jungle
at
howli
thana

own
shoe

a
messenger

heart
of
the
presence

moved

so
great
favour
and

six
rupees

three
little
children

stomachs

pounds

rupee

will
make
so
clever
a
messenger

at
the
end
of
the
year

a
turban

roads
of
the
station
and
many
other
things
aha
sahib
i
am
clever
give
me
service
i
was
aforetime
in
the
police
a
bad
character
now
without
doubt
an
enemy
has
told
this
tale
never
was
i
a
scamp
i
am
a
man
of
clean
heart
and
all
my
words
are
true
they
knew
this
when
i
was
in
the
police
they
said
khan
is
a
true
speaker
in
whose
words
men
may
trust
i
am
a
delhi
pathan
sahib
all
delhi
pathans
are
good
men
you
have
seen
delhi
yes
it
is
true
that
there
be
many
scamps
among
the
delhi
pathans
how
wise
is
the
sahib
nothing
is
hid
from
his
eyes
and
he
will
make
me
his
messenger
and
i
will
take
all
his
notes
secretly
and
without
ostentation
nay
sahib
god
is
my
witness
that
i
meant
no
evil
i
have
long
desired
to
serve
under
a
true
sahib
a
virtuous
sahib
many
young
sahibs
are
as
devils
unchained
with
these
sahibs
i
would
take
no
service
not
though
all
the
stomachs
of
my
little
children
were
crying
for
bread
why
am
i
not
still
in
the
police
i
will
speak
true
talk
an
evil
came
to
the
thana
to
ram
baksh
the
havildar
and
maula
baksh
and
juggut
ram
and
bhim
singh
and
suruj
bul
ram
baksh
is
in
the
jail
for
a
space
and
so
also
is
maula
baksh
it
was
at
the
thana
of
howli
on
the
road
that
leads
to
wherein
are
many
dacoits
we
were
all
brave
men
rustums
wherefore
we
were
sent
to
that
thana
which
was
eight
miles
from
the
next
thana
all
day
and
all
night
we
watched
for
dacoits
why
does
the
sahib
laugh
nay
i
will
make
a
confession
the
dacoits
were
too
clever
and
seeing
this
we
made
no
further
trouble
it
was
in
the
hot
weather
what
can
a
man
do
in
the
hot
days
is
the
sahib
who
is
so
strong
is
he
even
vigorous
in
that
hour
we
made
an
arrangement
with
the
dacoits
for
the
sake
of
peace
that
was
the
work
of
the
havildar
who
was
fat
ho
ho
sahib
he
is
now
getting
thin
in
the
jail
among
the
carpets
the
havildar
said
give
us
no
trouble
and
we
will
give
you
no
trouble
at
the
end
of
the
reaping
send
us
a
man
to
lead
before
the
judge
a
man
of
infirm
mind
against
whom
the
case
will
break
down
thus
we
shall
save
our
honour
to
this
talk
the
dacoits
agreed
and
we
had
no
trouble
at
the
thana
and
could
eat
melons
in
peace
sitting
upon
our
charpoys
all
day
long
sweet
as
are
the
melons
of
howli
now
there
was
an
assistant
commissioner
a
stunt
sahib
in
that
district
called
yunkum
sahib
aha
he
was
even
as
is
the
sahib
who
without
doubt
will
give
me
the
shadow
of
his
protection
many
eyes
had
yunkum
sahib
and
moved
quickly
through
his
district
men
called
him
the
tiger
of
because
he
would
arrive
unannounced
and
make
his
kill
and
before
sunset
would
be
giving
trouble
to
the
tehsildars
thirty
miles
away
no
one
knew
the
comings
or
the
goings
of
yunkum
sahib
he
had
no
camp
and
when
his
horse
was
weary
he
rode
upon
a
i
do
not
know
its
name
but
the
sahib
sat
in
the
midst
of
three
silver
wheels
that
made
no
creaking
and
drave
them
with
his
legs
prancing
like
a
horse
thus
a
shadow
of
a
hawk
upon
the
fields
was
not
more
without
noise
than
the
of
yunkum
sahib
it
was
here
it
was
there
it
was
gone
and
the
rapport
was
made
and
there
was
trouble
ask
the
tehsildar
of
rohestri
how
the
came
to
be
known
sahib
it
fell
upon
a
night
that
we
of
the
thana
slept
according
to
custom
upon
our
charpoys
having
eaten
the
evening
meal
and
drunk
tobacco
when
we
awoke
in
the
morning
behold
of
our
six
rifles
not
one
remained
also
the
big
that
was
in
the
havildar
charge
was
gone
seeing
these
things
we
were
very
much
afraid
thinking
on
our
parts
that
the
dacoits
regardless
of
honour
had
come
by
night
and
put
us
to
shame
then
said
ram
baksh
the
havildar
be
silent
the
business
is
an
evil
business
but
it
may
yet
go
well
let
us
make
the
case
complete
bring
a
kid
and
my
tulwar
see
you
not
now
o
fools
a
kick
for
a
horse
but
a
word
is
enough
for
a
man
we
of
the
thana
perceiving
quickly
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
havildar
and
greatly
fearing
that
the
service
would
be
lost
made
haste
to
take
the
kid
into
the
inner
room
and
attended
to
the
words
of
the
havildar
dacoits
came
said
the
havildar
and
we
taking
his
words
repeated
after
him
according
to
custom
was
a
great
fight
said
the
havildar
of
us
no
man
escaped
unhurt
the
bars
of
the
window
were
broken
suruj
bul
see
thou
to
that
and
o
men
put
speed
into
your
work
for
a
runner
must
go
with
the
news
to
the
tiger
of
thereon
suruj
bul
leaning
with
his
shoulder
brake
in
the
bars
of
the
window
and
i
beating
her
with
a
whip
made
the
havildar
mare
skip
among
the
till
they
were
much
trodden
with
these
things
being
made
i
returned
to
the
thana
and
the
goat
was
slain
and
certain
portions
of
the
walls
were
blackened
with
fire
and
each
man
dipped
his
clothes
a
little
into
the
blood
of
the
goat
know
o
sahib
that
a
wound
made
by
man
upon
his
own
body
can
by
those
skilled
be
easily
discerned
from
a
wound
wrought
by
another
man
therefore
the
havildar
taking
his
tulwar
smote
one
of
us
lightly
on
the
forearm
in
the
fat
and
another
on
the
leg
and
a
third
on
the
back
of
the
hand
thus
dealt
he
with
all
of
us
till
the
blood
came
and
suruj
bul
more
eager
than
the
others
took
out
much
hair
o
sahib
never
was
so
perfect
an
arrangement
yea
even
i
would
have
sworn
that
the
thana
had
been
treated
as
we
said
there
was
smoke
and
breaking
and
blood
and
trampled
earth
now
maula
baksh
said
the
havildar
the
house
of
the
stunt
sahib
and
carry
the
news
of
the
dacoity
do
you
also
o
afzal
khan
run
there
and
take
heed
that
you
are
mired
with
sweat
and
dust
on
your
incoming
the
blood
will
be
dry
on
the
clothes
i
will
stay
and
send
a
straight
report
to
the
dipty
sahib
and
we
will
catch
certain
that
ye
know
of
villagers
so
that
all
may
be
ready
against
the
dipty
arrival
thus
maula
baksh
rode
and
i
ran
hanging
on
the
stirrup
and
together
we
came
in
an
evil
plight
before
the
tiger
of
in
the
rohestri
tehsil
our
tale
was
long
and
correct
sahib
for
we
gave
even
the
names
of
the
dacoits
and
the
issue
of
the
fight
and
besought
him
to
come
but
the
tiger
made
no
sign
and
only
smiled
after
the
manner
of
sahibs
when
they
have
a
wickedness
in
their
hearts
ye
to
the
rapport
said
he
and
we
said
servants
swear
the
blood
of
the
fight
is
but
newly
dry
upon
us
judge
thou
if
it
be
the
blood
of
the
servants
of
the
presence
or
not
and
he
said
see
ye
have
done
well
but
he
did
not
call
for
his
horse
or
his
and
scour
the
land
as
was
his
custom
he
said
now
and
eat
bread
for
ye
be
wearied
men
i
will
wait
the
coming
of
the
dipty
sahib
now
it
is
the
order
that
the
havildar
of
the
thana
should
send
a
straight
report
of
all
dacoities
to
the
dipty
sahib
at
noon
came
he
a
fat
man
and
an
old
and
overbearing
withal
but
we
of
the
thana
had
no
fear
of
his
anger
dreading
more
the
silences
of
the
tiger
of
with
him
came
ram
baksh
the
havildar
and
the
others
guarding
ten
men
of
the
village
of
howli
all
men
evil
affected
towards
the
police
of
the
sirkar
as
prisoners
they
came
the
irons
upon
their
hands
crying
for
mercy
imam
baksh
the
farmer
who
had
denied
his
wife
to
the
havildar
and
others
rascals
against
whom
we
of
the
thane
bore
spite
it
was
well
done
and
the
havildar
was
proud
but
the
dipty
sahib
was
angry
with
the
stunt
for
lack
of
zeal
and
said
after
the
custom
of
the
english
people
and
extolled
the
havildar
yunkum
sahib
lay
still
in
his
long
chair
the
men
sworn
said
yunkum
sahib
and
captured
ten
evildoers
said
the
dipty
sahib
be
more
abroad
in
charge
take
horse
ride
and
go
in
the
name
of
the
sirkar
there
be
more
abroad
said
yunkum
sahib
there
is
no
need
of
a
horse
come
all
men
with
me
i
saw
the
mark
of
a
string
on
the
temples
of
imam
baksh
does
the
presence
know
the
torture
of
the
cold
draw
i
saw
also
the
face
of
the
tiger
of
the
evil
smile
was
upon
it
and
i
stood
back
ready
for
what
might
befall
well
it
was
sahib
that
i
did
this
thing
yunkum
sahib
unlocked
the
door
of
his
and
smiled
anew
within
lay
the
six
rifles
and
the
big
of
the
thana
of
howli
he
had
come
by
night
in
the
that
is
noiseless
as
a
ghoul
and
moving
among
us
asleep
had

power
of
a
lie
this
is
your
english
justice
protector
of
the
poor
look
at
my
back
and
loins
which
are
beaten
with
sticks
heavy
sticks
i
am
a
poor
man
and
there
is
no
justice
in
courts
there
were
two
of
us
and
we
were
born
of
one
birth
but
i
swear
to
you
that
i
was
born
the
first
and
ram
dass
is
the
younger
by
three
full
breaths
the
astrologer
said
so
and
it
is
written
in
my
horoscope
the
horoscope
of
durga
dass
but
we
were
alike
i
and
my
brother
who
is
a
beast
without
honour
so
alike
that
none
knew
together
or
apart
which
was
durga
dass
i
am
a
mahajun
of
pali
in
marwar
and
an
honest
man
this
is
true
talk
when
we
were
men
we
left
our
father
house
in
pali
and
went
to
the
punjab
where
all
the
people
are
and
sons
of
asses
we
took
shop
together
in
isser
jang
i
and
my
brother
near
the
big
well
where
the
governor
camp
draws
water
but
ram
dass
who
is
without
truth
made
quarrel
with
me
and
we
were
divided
he
took
his
books
and
his
pots
and
his
mark
and
became
a
a
in
the
long
street
of
isser
jang
near
the
gateway
of
the
road
that
goes
to
montgomery
it
was
not
my
fault
that
we
pulled
each
other
turbans
i
am
a
mahajun
of
pali
and
i
speak
true
talk
ram
dass
was
the
thief
and
the
liar
now
no
man
not
even
the
little
children
could
at
one
glance
see
which
was
ram
dass
and
which
was
durga
dass
but
all
the
people
of
isser
jang
may
they
die
without
sons
said
that
we
were
thieves
they
used
much
bad
talk
but
i
took
money
on
their
bedsteads
and
their
and
the
standing
crop
and
the
calf
unborn
from
the
well
in
the
big
square
to
the
gate
of
the
montgomery
road
they
were
fools
these
people
unfit
to
cut
the
of
a
marwari
from
pali
i
lent
money
to
them
all
a
little
very
little
only
here
a
pice
and
there
a
pice
god
is
my
witness
that
i
am
a
poor
man
the
money
is
all
with
ram
dass
may
his
sons
turn
christian
and
his
daughter
be
a
burning
fire
and
a
shame
in
the
house
from
generation
to
generation
may
she
die
unwed
and
be
the
mother
of
a
multitude
of
bastards
let
the
light
go
out
in
the
house
of
ram
dass
my
brother
this
i
pray
daily
twice
with
offerings
and
charms
thus
the
trouble
began
we
divided
the
town
of
isser
jang
between
us
i
and
my
brother
there
was
a
landholder
beyond
the
gates
living
but
one
short
mile
out
on
the
road
that
leads
to
montgomery
and
his
name
was
muhammad
shah
son
of
a
nawab
he
was
a
great
devil
and
drank
wine
so
long
as
there
were
women
in
his
house
and
wine
and
money
for
the
he
was
merry
and
wiped
his
mouth
ram
dass
lent
him
the
money
a
lakh
or
half
a
lakh
how
do
i
know
and
so
long
as
the
money
was
lent
the
landholder
cared
not
what
he
signed
the
people
of
isser
jang
were
my
portion
and
the
landholder
and
the
was
the
portion
of
ram
dass
for
so
we
had
arranged
i
was
the
poor
man
for
the
people
of
isser
jang
were
without
wealth
i
did
what
i
could
but
ram
dass
had
only
to
wait
without
the
door
of
the
landholder
and
to
lend
him
the
money
taking
the
bonds
from
the
hand
of
the
steward
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
after
the
lending
ram
dass
said
to
the
landholder
me
my
money
but
the
landholder
gave
him
abuse
but
ram
dass
went
into
the
courts
with
the
papers
and
the
bonds
all
correct
and
took
out
decrees
against
the
landholder
and
the
name
of
the
government
was
across
the
stamps
of
the
decrees
ram
dass
took
field
by
field
and
by
and
well
by
well
putting
in
his
own
men
debtors
of
the
of
isser
jang
to
cultivate
the
crops
so
he
crept
up
across
the
land
for
he
had
the
papers
and
the
name
of
the
government
was
across
the
stamps
till
his
men
held
the
crops
for
him
on
all
sides
of
the
big
white
house
of
the
landholder
it
was
well
done
but
when
the
landholder
saw
these
things
he
was
very
angry
and
cursed
ram
dass
after
the
manner
of
the
muhammadans
and
thus
the
landholder
was
angry
but
ram
dass
laughed
and
claimed
more
fields
as
was
written
upon
the
bonds
this
was
in
the
month
of
phagun
i
took
my
horse
and
went
out
to
speak
to
the
man
who
makes
upon
the
road
that
leads
to
montgomery
because
he
owed
me
a
debt
there
was
in
front
of
me
upon
his
horse
my
brother
ram
dass
and
when
he
saw
me
he
turned
aside
into
the
high
crops
because
there
was
hatred
between
us
and
i
went
forward
till
i
came
to
the
by
the
landholder
house
the
bats
were
flying
and
the
evening
smoke
was
low
down
upon
the
land
here
met
me
four
men
swashbucklers
and
muhammadans
with
their
faces
bound
up
laying
hold
of
my
bridle
and
crying
out
is
ram
dass
beat
me
they
beat
with
their
staves
heavy
staves
bound
about
with
wire
at
the
end
such
weapons
as
those
swine
of
punjabis
use
till
having
cried
for
mercy
i
fell
down
senseless
but
these
shameless
ones
still
beat
me
saying
ram
dass
this
is
your
interest
well
weighed
and
counted
into
your
hand
ram
dass
i
cried
aloud
that
i
was
not
ram
dass
but
durga
dass
his
brother
yet
they
only
beat
me
the
more
and
when
i
could
make
no
more
outcry
they
left
me
but
i
saw
their
faces
there
was
elahi
baksh
who
runs
by
the
side
of
the
landholder
white
horse
and
nur
ali
the
keeper
of
the
door
and
wajib
ali
the
very
strong
cook
and
abdul
latif
the
messenger
all
of
the
household
of
the
landholder
these
things
i
can
swear
on
the
cow
tail
if
need
be
but
ahi
it
has
been
already
sworn
and
i
am
a
poor
man
whose
honour
is
lost
when
these
four
had
gone
away
laughing
my
brother
ram
dass
came
out
of
the
crops
and
mourned
over
me
as
one
dead
but
i
opened
my
eyes
and
prayed
him
to
get
me
water
when
i
had
drunk
he
carried
me
on
his
back
and
by
byways
brought
me
into
the
town
of
isser
jang
my
heart
was
turned
to
ram
dass
my
brother
in
that
hour
because
of
his
kindness
and
i
lost
my
enmity
but
a
snake
is
a
snake
till
it
is
dead
and
a
liar
is
a
liar
till
the
judgment
of
the
gods
takes
hold
of
his
heel
i
was
wrong
in
that
i
trusted
my
brother
the
son
of
my
mother
when
we
had
come
to
his
house
and
i
was
a
little
restored
i
told
him
my
tale
and
he
said
doubt
it
is
me
whom
they
would
have
beaten
but
the
law
courts
are
open
and
there
is
the
justice
of
the
sirkar
above
all
and
to
the
law
courts
do
thou
go
when
this
sickness
is
overpast
now
when
we
two
had
left
pali
in
the
old
years
there
fell
a
famine
that
ran
from
jeysulmir
to
gurgaon
and
touched
gogunda
in
the
south
at
that
time
the
sister
of
my
father
came
away
and
lived
with
us
in
isser
jang
for
a
man
must
above
all
see
that
his
folk
do
not
die
of
want
when
the
quarrel
between
us
twain
came
about
the
sister
of
my
father
a
lean
without
teeth
said
that
ram
dass
had
the
right
and
went
with
him
into
her
hands
because
she
knew
medicines
and
many
cures
ram
dass
my
brother
put
me
faint
with
the
beating
and
much
bruised
even
to
the
pouring
of
blood
from
the
mouth
when
i
had
two
days
sickness
the
fever
came
upon
me
and
i
set
aside
the
fever
to
the
account
written
in
my
mind
against
the
landholder
the
punjabis
of
isser
jang
are
all
the
sons
of
belial
and
a
but
they
are
very
good
witnesses
bearing
testimony
unshakingly
whatever
the
pleaders
may
say
i
would
purchase
witnesses
by
the
score
and
each
man
should
give
evidence
not
only
against
nur
ali
wajib
ali
abdul
latif
and
elahi
baksh
but
against
the
landholder
saying
that
he
upon
his
white
horse
had
called
his
men
to
beat
me
and
further
that
they
had
robbed
me
of
two
hundred
rupees
for
the
latter
testimony
i
would
remit
a
little
of
the
debt
of
the
man
who
sold
the
and
he
should
say
that
he
had
put
the
money
into
my
hands
and
had
seen
the
robbery
from
afar
but
being
afraid
had
run
away
this
plan
i
told
to
my
brother
ram
dass
and
he
said
that
the
arrangement
was
good
and
bade
me
take
comfort
and
make
swift
work
to
be
abroad
again
my
heart
was
opened
to
my
brother
in
my
sickness
and
i
told
him
the
names
of
those
whom
i
would
call
as
witnesses
all
men
in
my
debt
but
of
that
the
magistrate
sahib
could
have
no
knowledge
nor
the
landholder
the
fever
stayed
with
me
and
after
the
fever
i
was
taken
with
colic
and
gripings
very
terrible
in
that
day
i
thought
that
my
end
was
at
hand
but
i
know
now
that
she
who
gave
me
the
medicines
the
sister
of
my
father
a
widow
with
a
widow
heart
had
brought
about
my
second
sickness
ram
dass
my
brother
said
that
my
house
was
shut
and
locked
and
brought
me
the
big
and
my
books
together
with
all
the
moneys
that
were
in
my
house
even
the
money
that
was
buried
under
the
floor
for
i
was
in
great
fear
lest
thieves
should
break
in
and
dig
i
speak
true
talk
there
was
but
very
little
money
in
the
house
perhaps
ten
rupees
perhaps
twenty
how
can
i
tell
god
is
my
witness
that
i
am
a
poor
man
one
night
when
i
had
told
ram
dass
all
that
was
in
my
heart
of
the
lawsuit
that
i
would
bring
against
the
landholder
and
ram
dass
had
said
that
he
had
made
the
arrangements
with
the
witnesses
giving
me
their
names
written
i
was
taken
with
a
new
great
sickness
and
they
put
me
on
the
bed
when
i
was
a
little
recovered
i
can
not
tell
how
many
days
afterwards
i
made
enquiry
for
ram
dass
and
the
sister
of
my
father
said
that
he
had
gone
to
montgomery
upon
a
lawsuit
i
took
medicine
and
slept
very
heavily
without
waking
when
my
eyes
were
opened
there
was
a
great
stillness
in
the
house
of
ram
dass
and
none
answered
when
i
called
not
even
the
sister
of
my
father
this
filled
me
with
fear
for
i
knew
not
what
had
happened
taking
a
stick
in
my
hand
i
went
out
slowly
till
i
came
to
the
great
square
by
the
well
and
my
heart
was
hot
in
me
against
the
landholder
because
of
the
pain
of
every
step
i
took
i
called
for
jowar
singh
the
carpenter
whose
name
was
first
upon
the
list
of
those
who
should
bear
evidence
against
the
landholder
saying
all
things
ready
and
do
you
know
what
should
be
said
jowar
singh
answered
is
this
and
whence
do
you
come
durga
dass
i
said
my
bed
where
i
have
so
long
lain
sick
because
of
the
landholder
where
is
ram
dass
my
brother
who
was
to
have
made
the
arrangement
for
the
witnesses
surely
you
and
yours
know
these
things
then
jowar
singh
said
has
this
to
do
with
us
o
liar
i
have
borne
witness
and
i
have
been
paid
and
the
landholder
has
by
the
order
of
the
court
paid
both
the
five
hundred
rupees
that
he
robbed
from
ram
dass
and
yet
other
five
hundred
because
of
the
great
injury
he
did
to
your
brother
the
well
and
the
above
it
and
the
square
of
isser
jang
became
dark
in
my
eyes
but
i
leaned
on
my
stick
and
said
this
is
child
talk
and
senseless
it
was
i
who
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
landholder
and
i
am
come
to
make
ready
the
case
where

brother
ram

shook
his
head
and
a
woman
cried

quarrel
had
the
landholder
with
you

is
only
a
shameless
one
and
one
without
faith
who
profits
by
his
brother
smarts

these
no
bowels
i
cried
again
saying
the
cow
by
the
oath
of
the
cow
by
the
temple
of
the
mahadeo
i
and
i
only
was

the
death

talk

tottered
where
i
stood
for
the
sickness
and
the
pain
of

heavy
upon
me
then

from
his
ears
what
i
have
said
in
respect
to
the
case
is
true
as
these
men
here
can
testify
even
to
the
five
hundred
rupees
i
said
it
five
hundred
and
kirpa
ram
the
said
hundred
for
i
bore
witness
also
and
i
groaned
for
it
had
been
in
my
heart
to
have
said
two
hundred
only
then
a
new
fear
came
upon
me
and
my
bowels
turned
to
water
and
running
swiftly
to
the
house
of
ram
dass
i
sought
for
my
books
and
my
money
in
the
great
wooden
chest
under
my
bedstead
there
remained
nothing
not
even
a
cowrie
value
all
had
been
taken
by
the
devil
who
said
he
was
my
brother
i
went
to
my
own
house
also
and
opened
the
boards
of
the
shutters
but
there
also
was
nothing
save
the
rats
among
the
in
that
hour
my
senses
left
me
and
tearing
my
clothes
i
ran
to
the
crying
out
for
the
justice
of
the
english
on
my
brother
ram
dass
and
in
my
madness
telling
all
that
the
books
were
lost
when
men
saw
that
i
would
have
jumped
down
the
well
they
believed
the
truth
of
my
talk
more
especially
because
upon
my
back
and
bosom
were
still
the
marks
of
the
staves
of
the
landholder
jowar
singh
the
carpenter
withstood
me
and
turning
me
in
his
hands
for
he
is
a
very
strong
man
showed
the
scars
upon
my
body
and
bowed
down
with
laughter
upon
the
he
cried
aloud
so
that
all
heard
him
from
the
to
the
caravanserai
of
the
pilgrims
the
jackals
have
quarrelled
and
the
gray
one
has
been
caught
in
the
trap
in
truth
this
man
has
been
grievously
beaten
and
his
brother
has
taken
the
money
which
the
court
decreed
oh
this
shall
be
told
for
years
against
you
the
jackals
have
quarrelled
and
moreover
the
books
are
burned
o
people
indebted
to
durga
dass
and
i
know
that
ye
be
many
the
books
are
burned
then
all
isser
jang
took
up
the
cry
that
the
books
were
burned
ahi
that
in
my
folly
i
had
let
that
escape
my
mouth
and
they
laughed
throughout
the
city
they
gave
me
the
abuse
of
the
punjabi
which
is
a
terrible
abuse
and
very
hot
pelting
me
also
with
sticks
and
till
i
fell
down
and
cried
for
mercy
ram
narain
the
bade
the
people
cease
for
fear
that
the
news
should
get
into
montgomery
and
the
policemen
might
come
down
to
enquire
he
said
using
many
bad
words
much
mercy
will
i
do
to
you
durga

though
there
was
no
mercy
in
your
dealings
with
my
sister
son
over
the
matter
of
the
dun
heifer
has
any
man
a
pony
on
which
he
sets
no
store
that
this
fellow
may
escape
if
the
landholder
hears
that
one
of
the
twain
and
god
knows
whether
he
beat
one
or
both
but
this
man
is
certainly
beaten
be
in
the
city
there
will
be
a
murder
done
and
then
will
come
the
police
making
inquisition
into
each

and
eating

all

long
kirpa

sick
but
with

and

time
as

if

be
more
than
two

i
will

only
kirpa

said
it
so
men
brought
out
the
pony
and
i
asked
leave
to
draw
a
little
water
from
the
well
because
i
was
dried
up
with
fear
then
ram

said

so

but
above
all
do
not
take
the
pony
bridle
for
that

mine
and
i
went
out
of
isser
jang
amid
the
laughing
of
the
jats
and
the
walked
by
my
side
waiting
for
the
pony
to
fall
dead
in
one
mile
it
died
and
being
full
of
fear
of
the
landholder
i
ran
till

to
this
place
but

or

or

deep
as
the
pit
and
dark
as
the
heart
of
a
man
miner
weaver
went
out
to
reap
but
stayed
to
unravel
the
ha
ha
ha
is
there
any
sense
in
a
weaver
janki
meah
glared
at
kundoo
but
as
janki
meah
was
blind
kundoo
was
not
impressed
he
had
come
to
argue
with
janki
meah
and
if
chance
favoured
to
make
love
to
the
old
man
pretty
young
wife
this
was
kundoo
grievance
and
he
spoke
in
the
name
of
all
the
five
men
who
with
janki
meah
composed
the
gang
in
number
seven
gallery
of
janki
meah
had
been
blind
for
the
thirty
years
during
which
he
had
served
the
jimahari
collieries
with
pick
and
crowbar
all
through
those
thirty
years
he
had
regularly
every
morning
before
going
down
drawn
from
the
overseer
his
allowance
of
just
as
if
he
had
been
an
eyed
miner
what
kundoo
gang
resented
as
hundreds
of
gangs
had
resented
before
was
janki
meah
selfishness
he
would
not
add
the
oil
to
the
common
stock
of
his
gang
but
would
save
and
sell
it
knew
these
workings
before
you
were
born
janki
meah
used
to
reply
do
want
the
light
to
get
my
coal
out
by
and
i
am
not
going
to
help
you
the
oil
is
mine
and
i
intend
to
keep
it
a
strange
man
in
many
ways
was
janki
meah
the
sightless
weaver
who
had
turned
pitman
all
day
long
except
on
sundays
and
mondays
when
he
was
usually
drunk
he
worked
in
the
shaft
of
the
jimahari
colliery
as
cleverly
as
a
man
with
all
the
senses
at
evening
he
went
up
in
the
great
cage
to
the
and
there
called
for
his
pony
a
rusty
beast
nearly
as
old
as
janki
meah
the
pony
would
come
to
his
side
and
janki
meah
would
clamber
on
to
its
back
and
be
taken
at
once
to
the
plot
of
land
which
he
like
the
other
miners
received
from
the
jimahari
company
the
pony
knew
that
place
and
when
after
six
years
the
company
changed
all
the
allotments
to
prevent
the
miners
from
acquiring
proprietary
rights
janki
meah
represented
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
were
his
holding
shifted
he
would
never
be
able
to
find
his
way
to
the
new
one
horse
only
knows
that
place
pleaded
janki
meah
and
so
he
was
allowed
to
keep
his
land
on
the
strength
of
this
concession
and
his
accumulated
janki
meah
took
a
second
wife
a
girl
of
the
jolaha
main
stock
of
the
meahs
and
singularly
beautiful
janki
meah
could
not
see
her
beauty
wherefore
he
took
her
on
trust
and
forbade
her
to
go
down
the
pit
he
had
not
worked
for
thirty
years
in
the
dark
without
knowing
that
the
pit
was
no
place
for
pretty
women
he
loaded
her
with
ornaments
not
brass
or
pewter
but
real
silver
ones
and
she
rewarded
him
by
flirting
outrageously
with
kundoo
of
number
seven
gallery
gang
kundoo
was
really
the
but
janki
meah
insisted
upon
all
the
work
being
entered
in
his
own
name
and
chose
the
men
that
he
worked
with
custom
stronger
even
than
the
jimahari
company
dictated
that
janki
by
right
of
his
years
should
manage
these
things
and
should
also
work
despite
his
blindness
in
indian
mines
where
they
cut
into
the
solid
coal
with
the
pick
and
clear
it
out
from
floor
to
ceiling
he
could
come
to
no
great
harm
at
home
where
they
undercut
the
coal
and
bring
it
down
in
crashing
avalanches
from
the
roof
he
would
never
have
been
allowed
to
set
foot
in
a
pit
he
was
not
a
popular
man
because
of
his
but
all
the
gangs
admitted
that
janki
knew
all
the
or
workings
that
had
ever
been
sunk
or
worked
since
the
jimahari
company
first
started
operations
on
the
tarachunda
fields
pretty
little
unda
only
knew
that
her
old
husband
was
a
fool
who
could
be
managed
she
took
no
interest
in
the
collieries
except
in
so
far
as
they
swallowed
up
kundoo
five
days
out
of
the
seven
and
covered
him
with
kundoo
was
a
great
workman
and
did
his
best
not
to
get
drunk
because
when
he
had
saved
forty
rupees
unda
was
to
steal
everything
that
she
could
find
in
janki
house
and
run
with
kundoo
to
a
land
where
there
were
no
mines
and
every
one
kept
three
fat
bullocks
and
a
while
this
scheme
ripened
it
was
his
custom
to
drop
in
upon
janki
and
worry
him
about
the
unda
sat
in
a
corner
and
nodded
approval
on
the
night
when
kundoo
had
quoted
that
objectionable
proverb
about
weavers
janki
grew
angry
you
pig
said
he
i
am
and
old
i
am
but
before
ever
you
were
born
i
was
gray
among
the
coal
even
in
the
days
when
the
was
unsunk
and
there
were
not
two
thousand
men
here
i
was
known
to
have
all
knowledge
of
the
pits
what
is
there
that
i
do
not
know
from
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
to
the
end
of
the
last
drive
is
it
the
baromba
the
oldest
or
the
where
gallery
runs
up
to
number
five
the
old
fool
talk
said
kundoo
nodding
to
unda
gallery
of
will
cut
into
five
before
the
end
of
the
rains
we
have
a
month
solid
coal
before
us
the
babuji
says
so
pigji
dogji
what
do
these
fat
slugs
from
calcutta
know
he
draws
and
draws
and
draws
and
talks
and
talks
and
talks
and
his
maps
are
all
wrong
i
janki
know
that
this
is
so
when
a
man
has
been
shut
up
in
the
dark
for
thirty
years
god
gives
him
knowledge
the
old
gallery
that
tibu
gang
made
is
not
six
feet
from
number
five
doubt
god
gives
the
blind
knowledge
said
kundoo
with
a
look
at
unda
it
be
as
you
say
i
for
my
part
do
not
know
where
lies
the
gallery
of
tibu
gang
but
am
not
a
withered
monkey
who
needs
oil
to
grease
his
joints
with
kundoo
swung
out
of
the
hut
laughing
and
unda
giggled
janki
turned
his
sightless
eyes
towards
his
wife
and
swore
have
land
and
i
have
sold
a
great
deal
of
mused
janki
i
was
a
fool
to
marry
this
child
a
week
later
the
rains
set
in
with
a
vengeance
and
the
gangs
paddled
about
in
at
the
then
the
big
were
made
ready
and
the
manager
of
the
colliery
ploughed
through
the
wet
towards
the
tarachunda
river
swelling
between
its
soppy
banks
send
that
this
beastly
beck
does
misbehave
said
the
manager
piously
and
he
went
to
take
counsel
with
his
assistant
about
the
pumps
but
the
tarachunda
misbehaved
very
much
indeed
after
a
fall
of
three
inches
of
rain
in
an
hour
it
was
obliged
to
do
something
it
topped
its
bank
and
joined
the
that
was
hemmed
between
two
low
hills
just
where
the
embankment
of
the
colliery
main
line
crossed
when
a
large
part
of
a
river
and
a
few
acres
of
make
a
dead
set
for
a
culvert
the
culvert
may
spout
its
finest
but
the
water
can
not
get
out
the
manager
pranced
upon
one
leg
with
excitement
and
his
language
was
improper
he
had
reason
to
swear
because
he
knew
that
one
inch
of
water
on
land
meant
a
pressure
of
one
hundred
tons
to
the
acre
and
here
were
about
five
feet
of
water
forming
behind
the
railway
embankment
over
the
shallower
workings
of
you
must
understand
that
in
a
the
coal
nearest
the
surface
is
worked
first
from
the
central
shaft
that
is
to
say
the
miners
may
clear
out
the
stuff
to
within
ten
twenty
or
thirty
feet
of
the
surface
and
when
all
is
worked
out
leave
only
a
skin
of
earth
upheld
by
some
few
pillars
of
coal
in
a
deep
mine
where
they
know
that
they
have
any
amount
of
material
at
hand
men
prefer
to
get
all
their
mineral
out
at
one
shaft
rather
than
make
a
number
of
little
holes
to
tap
the
comparatively
unimportant
and
the
manager
watched
the
flood
the
culvert
spouted
a
gush
but
the
water
still
formed
and
word
was
sent
to
clear
the
men
out
of
the
cages
came
up
crammed
and
crammed
again
with
the
men
nearest
the
as
they
call
the
place
where
you
can
see
daylight
from
the
bottom
of
the
main
shaft
all
away
and
away
up
the
long
black
galleries
the
were
winking
and
dancing
like
so
many
fireflies
and
the
men
and
the
women
waited
for
the
clanking
rattling
thundering
cages
to
come
down
and
fly
up
again
but
the
were
very
far
off
and
word
could
not
be
passed
quickly
though
the
heads
of
the
gangs
and
the
assistant
shouted
and
swore
and
tramped
and
stumbled
the
manager
kept
one
eye
on
the
great
troubled
pool
behind
the
embankment
and
prayed
that
the
culvert
would
give
way
and
let
the
water
through
in
time
with
the
other
eye
he
watched
the
cages
come
up
and
saw
the
headmen
counting
the
roll
of
the
gangs
with
all
his
heart
and
soul
he
swore
at
the
winder
who
controlled
the
iron
drum
that
wound
up
the
wire
rope
on
which
hung
the
cages
in
a
little
time
there
was
a
in
the
water
behind
the
embankment
a
sucking
whirlpool
all
yellow
and
yeasty
the
water
had
smashed
through
the
skin
of
the
earth
and
was
pouring
into
the
old
shallow
workings
of
deep
down
below
a
rush
of
black
water
caught
the
last
gang
waiting
for
the
cage
and
as
they
clambered
in
the
whirl
was
about
their
waists
the
cage
reached
the
and
the
manager
called
the
roll
the
gangs
were
all
safe
except
gang
janki
gang
mogul
and
gang
rahim
eighteen
men
with
perhaps
ten
who
loaded
the
coal
into
the
little
iron
carriages
that
ran
on
the
tramways
of
the
main
galleries
these
gangs
were
in
the
of
a
mile
away
on
the
extreme
fringe
of
the
mine
once
more
the
cage
went
down
but
with
only
two
englishmen
in
it
and
dropped
into
a
swirling
roaring
current
that
had
almost
touched
the
roof
of
some
of
the
lower

of
the
wooden
balks
with
which
they
had
propped
the
old
workings
shot
past
on
the
current
just
missing
the
cage

do
want
our
ribs
knocked
out

said
the
manager
ca
even
save
the
company
props
the
cage
drew
out
of
the
water
with
a
splash
and
a
few
minutes
later
it
was
officially
reported
that
there
were
at
least
ten
feet
of
water
in
the
pit
eye
now
ten
feet
of
water
there
meant
that
all
other
places
in
the
mine
were
flooded
except
such
galleries
as
were
more
than
ten
feet
above
the
level
of
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
the
deep
workings
would
be
full
the
main
galleries
would
be
full
but
in
the
high
workings
reached
by
inclines
from
the
main
roads
there
would
be
a
certain
amount
of
air
cut
off
so
to
speak
by
the
water
and
squeezed
up
by
it
the
little
explain
how
water
behaves
when
you
pour
it
down
the
flooding
of
was
an
illustration
on
a
large
scale
the
holy
grove
what
has
happened
to
the
air
it
was
a
sonthal
gangman
of
gang
mogul
in
number
nine
gallery
and
he
was
driving
a
way
through
the
coal
then
there
was
a
rush
from
the
other
galleries
and
gang
janki
and
gang
rahim
stumbled
up
with
their
has
come
in
the
mine
they
said
there
is
no
way
of

went
down
said
janki
the
slope
of
my
gallery
and
i
felt
the

been
no

in
the
cutting
in
our
time
clamoured
the
women

when
my

great
trouble

the
three
gangs
and
the
left
number
nine
gallery
and
went
further
up
number
sixteen
at
one
turn
of
the
road
they
could
see
the
pitchy
black
water
lapping
on
the
coal
it
had
touched
the
roof
of
a
gallery
that
they
knew
well
a
gallery
where
they
used
to
smoke
their
and
manage
their
flirtations
seeing
this
they
called
aloud
upon
their
gods
and
the
meahs
who
are
thrice
bastered
muhammadans
strove
to
recollect
the
name
of
the
prophet
they
came
to
a
great
open
square
whence
nearly
all
the
coal
had
been
extracted
it
was
the
end
of
the
and
the
end
of
the
mine
far
away
down
the
gallery
a
small
used
for
keeping
dry
a
deep
working
and
fed
with
steam
from
above
was
throbbing
faithfully
they
heard
it
cease
have
cut
off
the
steam
said
kundoo

given
the
order
to

very
bad
air
here
because

janki

the
lamps
were
put
out
and
the
company
sat
still
in
the
utter
dark
somebody
rose
quietly
and
began
walking
over
the
coals
it
was
janki
who
was
touching
the
walls
with
his
hands
is
the
ledge
he
murmured
to
himself
sit
said
kundoo
we
die

die
the
air
is
very
bad
but
janki
still
stumbled
and
crept
and
tapped
with
his
pick
upon
the
walls
the
women
rose
to
their
feet
all
where
you
are
without
the
lamps
you
can
not
see
and
i
i
am
always
seeing
said
janki
then
he
paused
and
called
out
you
who
have
been
in
the
cutting
more
than
ten
years
what
is
the
name
of
this
open
place

the
sonthal
who
had
complained
of
the
vileness
of
the
air

place

my
voice
and
i

was
a
rush
in
the
dark
and
janki
felt
the
first
man
face
hit
his
knees
as
the
sonthal
scrambled
up
the
ledge
cried
janki
sunua
manji

janki

the

miner

not
drop
his
pick
one
by

janki

they
crept
into
the
old
gallery
a
way
with
a
scant
four
feet
from
hill
to
roof
air

better
here
said
jasoda
they
could
hear
her
heart
beating
in
thick
sick
bumps
slowly
said
janki

an
old
man
and
i
forget
many
things

is
tibu

but
where

the
four
bricks
where
they
used
to
put
their
fire
on
when
the
sahibs
never
saw
slowly
slowly
o
you
people
behind
they
heard
his
hands
disturbing
the
small
coal
on
the
floor
of
the
gallery
and
then
a
dull
sound
is
one
unbaked
brick
and
this
is
another
and
another
kundoo
is
a
young
man
let
him
come
forward

a
knee
upon
this
brick
and

here
when

were
at
dinner
on
the
last
day
before

good
coal

they
heard
the
men
of
five
on

side
and
five

sundays
later
or

may
have
been
one
strike

kundoo
but
give
me
room
to
go
back
kundoo
doubting
drove
the
pick
but
the
first
soft
crush
of
the
coal
was
a
call
to
him
he
was
fighting
for
his
life
and
for
unda
pretty
little
unda
with
rings
on
all
her
toes
for
unda
and
the
forty
rupees
the
women
sang
the
song
of
the
pick
the
terrible
slow
swinging
melody
with
the
muttered
chorus
that
repeats
the
sliding
of
the
loosened
coal
and
to
each
cadence
kundoo
smote
in
the
black
dark
when
he
could
do
no
more
sunua
manji
took
the
pick
and
struck
for
his
life
and
his
wife
and
his
village
beyond
the
blue
hills
over
the
tarachunda
river
an
hour
the
men
worked
and
then
the
women
cleared
away

coal

very
bad
but

hard
for
the
fifth
time
kundoo
took
up
the
pick
as
the
sonthal
crawled
back
the
song
had
scarcely
recommenced
when
it
was
broken
by
a
yell
from
kundoo
that
echoed
down
the
gallery
hua
par
hua
we
are
through
we
are
through
the
imprisoned
air
in
the
mine
shot
through
the
opening
and
the
women
at
the
far
end
of
the
gallery
heard
the
water
rush
through
the
pillars
of
room
and
roar
against
the
ledge
having
fulfilled
the
law
under
which
it
worked
it
rose
no
farther
the
women
screamed
and
pressed
forward
water
has
come
we
shall
be
killed
let
us
go
kundoo
crawled
through
the
gap
and
found
himself
in
a
propped
gallery
by
the
simple
process
of
hitting
his
head
against
a
beam
i
know
the
pits
or
do
i
not
chuckled
janki

the
number

your
names

your
gang
now
let
us
go
forward
each
catching
hold
of
the
other
as
before
they
formed
a
line
in
the
darkness
and
janki
led
them
for
a
in
a
strange
pit
is
only
one
degree
less
liable
to
err
than
an
ordinary
mortal
underground
for
the
first
time
at
last
they
saw
a
and
gangs
janki
mogul
and
rahim
of
stumbled
dazed
into
the
glare
of
the
at
the
bottom
of
five
janki
feeling
his
way
and
the
rest
behind
has
come
into
god
knows
where
are
the
others
i
have
brought
these
men
from
tibu
gallery
in
our
cutting
making
connection
through
the
north
side
of
the
gallery
take
us
to
the
cage
said
janki
meah
at
the
of
some
thousand
people
clamoured
and
wept
and
shouted
one
hundred
men
one
thousand
men
had
been
drowned
in
the
cutting
they
would
all
go
to
their
homes
where
were
their
men
little
unda
her
cloth
drenched
with
the
rain
stood
at
the
calling
down
the
shaft
for
kundoo
they
had
swung
the
cages
clear
of
the
mouth
and
her
only
answer
was
the
murmur
of
the
flood
in
the
pit
eye
two
hundred
and
sixty
feet
below
after
that
woman
she
chuck
herself
down
the
shaft
in
a
minute
shouted
the
manager
but
he
need
not
have
troubled
unda
was
afraid
of
death
she
wanted
kundoo
the
assistant
was
watching
the
flood
and
seeing
how
far
he
could
wade
into
it
there
was
a
lull
in
the
water
and
the
whirlpool
had
slackened
the
mine
was
full
and
the
people
at
the
howled
faith
we
shall
be
lucky
if
we
have
five
hundred
hands
on
the
place
said
the
manager
some
chance
yet
of
running
a
temporary
dam
across
that
water
shove
in
anything
tubs
and
if
you
have
enough
bricks
make
them
work
now
if
they
never
worked
before
hi
you
gangers
make
them
work
little
by
little
the
crowd
was
broken
into
detachments
and
pushed
towards
the
water
with
promises
of
overtime
the
began
and
when
it
was
fairly
under
way
the
manager
thought
that
the
hour
had
come
for
the
pumps
there
was
no
fresh
inrush
into
the
mine
the
tall
red
rose
and
fell
and
the
pumps
snored
and
guttered
and
shrieked
as
the
first
water
poured
out
of
the
pipe
must
run
her
all
said
the
manager
wearily
no
hope
for
the
poor
devils
down
below
look
here
gur
sahai
if
you
are
proud
of
your
engines
show
me
what
they
can
do
now
gur
sahai
grinned
and
nodded
with
his
right
hand
upon
the
lever
and
an
in
his
left
he
could
do
no
more
than
he
was
doing
but
he
could
keep
that
up
till
the
dawn
were
the
company
pumps
to
be
beaten
by
the
vagaries
of
that
troublesome
tarachunda
river
never
never
and
the
pumps
sobbed
and
panted
never
the
manager
sat
in
the
shelter
of
the
roofing
trying
to
dry
himself
by
the
fire
and
in
the
dreary
dusk
he
saw
the
crowds
on
the
dam
scatter
and
fly
the
end
he
groaned
take
us
six
weeks
to
persuade
that
we
have
tried
to
drown
their
mates
on
purpose
oh
for
a
decent
rational
geordie
but
the
flight
had
no
panic
in
it
men
had
run
over
from
five
with
astounding
news
and
the
foremen
could
not
hold
their
gangs
together
presently
surrounded
by
a
clamorous
crew
gangs
rahim
mogul
and
janki
and
ten
walked
up
to
report
themselves
and
pretty
little
unda
stole
away
to
janki
hut
to
prepare
his
evening
meal
i
found
the
way
explained
janki
meah
now
will
the
company
give
me
pension
the
simple
shouted
and
leaped
and
went
back
to
the
dam
reassured
in
their
old
belief
that
whatever
happened
so
great
was
the
power
of
the
company
whose
salt
they
ate
none
of
them
could
be
killed
but
gur
sahai
only
bared
his
white
teeth
and
kept
his
hand
upon
the
lever
and
proved
his
pumps
to
the
uttermost
say
said
the
assistant
to
the
manager
a
week
later
you
recollect
thing

thought
of
it
in
the
cage

that
balk
went
by

business

upside
down

in
my
veranda

this
morning

river
barred
the

the
matter
at
all
now
it
likely
that
the
sahib
would
speak
true
talk
to
me
who
am
only
a
black
man
small
wonder
then
that
he
is
in
haste
thirty
years
have
i
beaten
the
gong
at
this
ford
but
never
have
i
seen
a
sahib
in
such
haste
thirty
years
sahib
that
is
a
very
long
time
thirty
years
ago
this
ford
was
on
the
track
of
the
and
i
have
seen
two
thousand
cross
in
one
night
now
the
rail
has
come
and
the
says
and
a
hundred
lakhs
of
maunds
slide
across
that
big
bridge
it
is
very
wonderful
but
the
ford
is
lonely
now
that
there
are
no
to
camp
under
the
trees
nay
do
not
trouble
to
look
at
the
sky
without
it
will
rain
till
the
dawn
listen
the
boulders
are
talking
tonight
in
the
bed
of
the
river
hear
them
they
would
be
husking
your
bones
sahib
had
you
tried
to
cross
see
i
will
shut
the
door
and
no
rain
can
enter
ahi
ugh
thirty
years
on
the
banks
of
the
ford
an
old
man
am
i
and
where
is
the
oil
for
the
lamp
your
pardon
but
because
of
my
years
i
sleep
no
sounder
than
a
dog
and
you
moved
to
the
door
look
then
sahib
look
and
listen
a
full
half
from
bank
to
bank
is
the
stream
now
you
can
see
it
under
the
stars
and
there
are
ten
feet
of
water
therein
it
will
not
shrink
because
of
the
anger
in
your
eyes
and
it
will
not
be
quiet
on
account
of
your
curses
which
is
louder
sahib
your
voice
or
the
voice
of
the
river
call
to
it
perhaps
it
will
be
ashamed
lie
down
and
sleep
afresh
sahib
i
know
the
anger
of
the
barhwi
when
there
has
fallen
rain
in
the
i
swam
the
flood
once
on
a
night
worse
than
this
and
by
the
favour
of
god
i
was
released
from
death
when
i
had
come
to
the
very
gates
thereof
may
i
tell
the
tale
very
good
talk
i
will
fill
the
pipe
anew
thirty
years
ago
it
was
when
i
was
a
young
man
and
had
but
newly
come
to
the
ford
i
was
strong
then
and
the
had
no
doubt
when
i
said
ford
is
clear
i
have
toiled
all
night
up
to
my
in
running
water
amid
a
hundred
bullocks
mad
with
fear
and
have
brought
them
across
losing
not
a
hoof
when
all
was
done
i
fetched
the
shivering
men
and
they
gave
me
for
reward
the
pick
of
their
cattle
the
of
the
drove
so
great
was
the
honour
in
which
i
was
held
but
when
the
rain
falls
and
the
river
rises
i
creep
into
my
hut
and
whimper
like
a
dog
my
strength
is
gone
from
me
i
am
an
old
man
and
the
has
made
the
ford
desolate
they
were
wont
to
call
me
the
strong
one
of
the
barhwi
behold
my
face
sahib
it
is
the
face
of
a
monkey
and
my
arm
it
is
the
arm
of
an
old
woman
i
swear
to
you
sahib
that
a
woman
has
loved
this
face
and
has
rested
in
the
hollow
of
this
arm
twenty
years
ago
sahib
believe
me
this
was
true
talk
twenty
years
ago
come
to
the
door
and
look
across
can
you
see
a
thin
fire
very
far
away
down
the
stream
that
is
the
in
the
shrine
of
hanuman
of
the
village
of
pateera
north
under
the
big
star
is
the
village
itself
but
it
is
hidden
by
a
bend
of
the
river
is
that
far
to
swim
sahib
would
you
take
off
your
clothes
and
adventure
yet
i
swam
to
pateera
not
once
but
many
times
and
there
are
in
the
river
too
love
knows
no
caste
else
why
should
i
a
musalman
and
the
son
of
a
musalman
have
sought
a
hindu
woman
a
widow
of
the
hindus
the
sister
of
the
headman
of
pateera
but
it
was
even
so
they
of
the
household
came
on
a
pilgrimage
to
muttra
when
she
was
but
newly
a
bride
silver
tires
were
upon
the
wheels
of
the
and
silken
curtains
hid
the
woman
sahib
i
made
no
haste
in
their
conveyance
for
the
wind
parted
the
curtains
and
i
saw
her
when
they
returned
from
pilgrimage
the
boy
that
was
her
husband
had
died
and
i
saw
her
again
in
the
by
god
these
hindus
are
fools
what
was
it
to
me
whether
she
was
hindu
or
jain
scavenger
leper
or
whole
i
would
have
married
her
and
made
her
a
home
by
the
ford
the
seventh
of
the
nine
bars
says
that
a
man
may
not
marry
one
of
the
idolaters
is
that
truth
both
shiahs
and
sunnis
say
that
a
musalman
may
not
marry
one
of
the
idolaters
is
the
sahib
a
priest
then
that
he
knows
so
much
i
will
tell
him
something
that
he
does
not
know
there
is
neither
shiah
nor
sunni
forbidden
nor
idolater
in
love
and
the
nine
bars
are
but
nine
little
fagots
that
the
flame
of
love
utterly
burns
away
in
truth
i
would
have
taken
her
but
what
could
i
do
the
headman
would
have
sent
his
men
to
break
my
head
with
staves
i
am
not
i
was
not
afraid
of
any
five
men
but
against
half
a
village
who
can
prevail
therefore
it
was
my
custom
these
things
having
been
arranged
between
us
twain
to
go
by
night
to
the
village
of
pateera
and
there
we
met
among
the
crops
no
man
knowing
aught
of
the
matter
behold
now
i
was
wont
to
cross
here
skirting
the
jungle
to
the
river
bend
where
the
railway
bridge
is
and
thence
across
the
elbow
of
land
to
pateera
the
light
of
the
shrine
was
my
guide
when
the
nights
were
dark
that
jungle
near
the
river
is
very
full
of
snakes
little
that
sleep
on
the
sand
and
moreover
her
brothers
would
have
slain
me
had
they
found
me
in
the
crops
but
none
knew
none
knew
save
she
and
i
and
the
blown
sand
of
the
covered
the
track
of
my
feet
in
the
hot
months
it
was
an
easy
thing
to
pass
from
the
ford
to
pateera
and
in
the
first
rains
when
the
river
rose
slowly
it
was
an
easy
thing
also
i
set
the
strength
of
my
body
against
the
strength
of
the
stream
and
nightly
i
ate
in
my
hut
here
and
drank
at
pateera
yonder
she
had
said
that
one
hirnam
singh
a
thief
had
sought
her
and
he
was
of
a
village
up
the
river
but
on
the
same
bank
all
sikhs
are
dogs
and
they
have
refused
in
their
folly
that
good
gift
of
god
tobacco
i
was
ready
to
destroy
hirnam
singh
that
ever
he
had
come
nigh
her
and
the
more
because
he
had
sworn
to
her
that
she
had
a
lover
and
that
he
would
lie
in
wait
and
give
the
name
to
the
headman
unless
she
went
away
with
him
what
curs
are
these
sikhs
after
that
news
i
swam
always
with
a
little
sharp
knife
in
my
belt
and
evil
would
it
have
been
for
a
man
had
he
stayed
me
i
knew
not
the
face
of
hirnam
singh
but
i
would
have
killed
any
who
came
between
me
and
her
upon
a
night
in
the
beginning
of
the
rains
i
was
minded
to
go
across
to
pateera
albeit
the
river
was
angry
now
the
nature
of
the
barhwi
is
this
sahib
in
twenty
breaths
it
comes
down
from
the
hills
a
wall
three
feet
high
and
i
have
seen
it
between
the
lighting
of
a
fire
and
the
cooking
of
a
grow
from
a
runnel
to
a
sister
of
the
jumna
when
i
left
this
bank
there
was
a
shoal
a
half
mile
down
and
i
made
shift
to
fetch
it
and
draw
breath
there
ere
going
forward
for
i
felt
the
hands
of
the
river
heavy
upon
my
heels
yet
what
will
a
young
man
not
do
for
love
sake
there
was
but
little
light
from
the
stars
and
midway
to
the
shoal
a
branch
of
the
stinking
deodar
tree
brushed
my
mouth
as
i
swam
that
was
a
sign
of
heavy
rain
in
the
and
beyond
for
the
deodar
is
a
strong
tree
not
easily
shaken
from
the
hillsides
i
made
haste
the
river
aiding
me
but
ere
i
touched
the
shoal
the
pulse
of
the
stream
beat
as
it
were
within
me
and
around
and
behold
the
shoal
was
gone
and
i
rode
high
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
that
ran
from
bank
to
bank
has
the
sahib
ever
been
cast
into
much
water
that
fights
and
will
not
let
a
man
use
his
limbs
to
me
my
head
upon
the
water
it
seemed
as
though
there
were
naught
but
water
to
the
world
end
and
the
river
drave
me
with
its
driftwood
a
man
is
a
very
little
thing
in
the
belly
of
a
flood
and
flood
though
i
knew
it
not
was
the
great
flood
about
which
men
talk
still
my
liver
was
dissolved
and
i
lay
like
a
log
upon
my
back
in
the
fear
of
death
there
were
living
things
in
the
water
crying
and
howling
grievously
beasts
of
the
forest
and
cattle
and
once
the
voice
of
a
man
asking
for
help
but
the
rain
came
and
lashed
the
water
white
and
i
heard
no
more
save
the
roar
of
the
boulders
below
and
the
roar
of
the
rain
above
thus
i
was
whirled
wrestling
for
the
breath
in
me
it
is
very
hard
to
die
when
one
is
young
can
the
sahib
standing
here
see
the
railway
bridge
look
there
are
the
lights
of
the
going
to
peshawur
the
bridge
is
now
twenty
feet
above
the
river
but
upon
that
night
the
water
was
roaring
against
the
and
against
the
lattice
came
i
feet
first
but
much
driftwood
was
piled
there
and
upon
the
piers
and
i
took
no
great
hurt
only
the
river
pressed
me
as
a
strong
man
presses
a
weaker
scarcely
could
i
take
hold
of
the
and
crawl
to
the
upper
boom
sahib
the
water
was
foaming
across
the
rails
a
foot
deep
judge
therefore
what
manner
of
flood
it
must
have
been
i
could
not
hear
i
could
not
see
i
could
but
lie
on
the
boom
and
pant
for
breath
after
a
while
the
rain
ceased
and
there
came
out
in
the
sky
certain
new
washed
stars
and
by
their
light
i
saw
that
there
was
no
end
to
the
black
water
as
far
as
the
eye
could
travel
and
the
water
had
risen
upon
the
rails
there
were
dead
beasts
in
the
driftwood
on
the
piers
and
others
caught
by
the
neck
in
the
and
others
not
yet
drowned
who
strove
to
find
a
foothold
on
the
buffaloes
and
kine
and
wild
pig
and
deer
one
or
two
and
snakes
and
jackals
past
all
counting
their
bodies
were
black
upon
the
left
side
of
the
bridge
but
the
smaller
of
them
were
forced
through
the
and
whirled
thereafter
the
stars
died
and
the
rain
came
down
afresh
and
the
river
rose
yet
more
and
i
felt
the
bridge
begin
to
stir
under
me
as
a
man
stirs
in
his
sleep
ere
he
wakes
but
i
was
not
afraid
sahib
i
swear
to
you
that
i
was
not
afraid
though
i
had
no
power
in
my
limbs
i
knew
that
i
should
not
die
till
i
had
seen
her
once
more
but
i
was
very
cold
and
i
felt
that
the
bridge
must
go
there
was
a
trembling
in
the
water
such
a
trembling
as
goes
before
the
coming
of
a
great
wave
and
the
bridge
lifted
its
flank
to
the
rush
of
that
coming
so
that
the
right
lattice
dipped
under
water
and
the
left
rose
clear
on
my
beard
sahib
i
am
speaking
god
truth
as
a
mirzapore
careens
to
the
wind
so
the
barhwi
bridge
turned
thus
and
in
no
other
manner
i
slid
from
the
boom
into
deep
water
and
behind
me
came
the
wave
of
the
wrath
of
the
river
i
heard
its
voice
and
the
scream
of
the
middle
part
of
the
bridge
as
it
moved
from
the
piers
and
sank
and
i
knew
no
more
till
i
rose
in
the
middle
of
the
great
flood
i
put
forth
my
hand
to
swim
and
lo
it
fell
upon
the
knotted
hair
of
the
head
of
a
man
he
was
dead
for
no
one
but
i
the
strong
one
of
barhwi
could
have
lived
in
that
race
he
had
been
dead
full
two
days
for
he
rode
high
wallowing
and
was
an
aid
to
me
i
laughed
then
knowing
for
a
surety
that
i
should
yet
see
her
and
take
no
harm
and
i
twisted
my
fingers
in
the
hair
of
the
man
for
i
was
far
spent
and
together
we
went
down
the
stream
he
the
dead
and
i
the
living
lacking
that
help
i
should
have
sunk
the
cold
was
in
my
marrow
and
my
flesh
was
ribbed
and
sodden
on
my
bones
but
had
no
fear
who
had
known
the
uttermost
of
the
power
of
the
river
and
i
let
him
go
where
he
chose
at
last
we
came
into
the
power
of
a
that
set
to
the
right
bank
and
i
strove
with
my
feet
to
draw
with
it
but
the
dead
man
swung
heavily
in
the
whirl
and
i
feared
that
some
branch
had
struck
him
and
that
he
would
sink
the
tops
of
the
tamarisk
brushed
my
knees
so
i
knew
we
were
come
into
above
the
crops
and
after
i
let
down
my
legs
and
felt
bottom
the
ridge
of
a
field
and
after
the
dead
man
stayed
upon
a
knoll
under
a
and
i
drew
my
body
from
the
water
rejoicing
does
the
sahib
know
whither
the
backwash
of
the
flood
had
borne
me
to
the
knoll
which
is
the
eastern
of
the
village
of
pateera
no
other
place
i
drew
the
dead
man
up
on
the
grass
for
the
service
that
he
had
done
me
and
also
because
i
knew
not
whether
i
should
need
him
again
then
i
went
crying
thrice
like
a
jackal
to
the
appointed
place
which
was
near
the
byre
of
the
headman
house
but
my
love
was
already
there
weeping
she
feared
that
the
flood
had
swept
my
hut
at
the
barhwi
ford
when
i
came
softly
through
the
water
she
thought
it
was
a
ghost
and
would
have
fled
but
i
put
my
arms
round
her
and
i
was
no
ghost
in
those
days
though
i
am
an
old
man
now
ho
ho
dried
corn
in
truth
maize
without
juice
ho
ho
footnote
i
grieve
to
say
that
the
warden
of
barhwi
ford
is
responsible
here
for
two
very
bad
puns
in
the
r
i
told
her
the
story
of
the
breaking
of
the
barhwi
bridge
and
she
said
that
i
was
greater
than
mortal
man
for
none
may
cross
the
barhwi
in
full
flood
and
i
had
seen
what
never
man
had
seen
before
hand
in
hand
we
went
to
the
knoll
where
the
dead
lay
and
i
showed
her
by
what
help
i
had
made
the
ford
she
looked
also
upon
the
body
under
the
stars
for
the
latter
end
of
the
night
was
clear
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
crying
is
the
body
of
hirnam
singh
i
said
swine
is
of
more
use
dead
than
living
my
beloved
and
she
said
for
he
has
saved
the
dearest
life
in
the
world
to
my
love
none
the
less
he
can
not
stay
here
for
that
would
bring
shame
upon
me
the
body
was
not
a
gunshot
from
her
door
then
said
i
rolling
the
body
with
my
hands
hath
judged
between
us
hirnam
singh
that
thy
blood
might
not
be
upon
my
head
now
whether
i
have
done
thee
a
wrong
in
keeping
thee
from
the
do
thou
and
the
crows
settle
together
so
i
cast
him
adrift
into
the
and
he
was
drawn
out
to
the
open
ever
wagging
his
thick
black
beard
like
a
priest
under
the
and
i
saw
no
more
of
himam
singh
before
the
breaking
of
the
day
we
two
parted
and
i
moved
towards
such
of
the
jungle
as
was
not
flooded
with
the
full
light
i
saw
what
i
had
done
in
the
darkness
and
the
bones
of
my
body
were
loosened
in
my
flesh
for
there
ran
two
of
raging
water
between
the
village
of
pateera
and
the
trees
of
the
far
bank
and
in
the
middle
the
piers
of
the
barhwi
bridge
showed
like
broken
teeth
in
the
jaw
of
an
old
man
nor
was
there
any
life
upon
the
waters
neither
birds
nor
boats
but
only
an
army
of
drowned
things
bullocks
and
horses
and
men
and
the
river
was
redder
than
blood
from
the
clay
of
the
never
had
i
seen
such
a
flood
never
since
that
year
have
i
seen
the
like
and
o
sahib
no
man
living
had
done
what
i
had
done
there
was
no
return
for
me
that
day
not
for
all
the
lands
of
the
headman
would
i
venture
a
second
time
without
the
shield
of
darkness
that
cloaks
danger
i
went
a
up
the
river
to
the
house
of
a
blacksmith
saying
that
the
flood
had
swept
me
from
my
hut
and
they
gave
me
food
seven
days
i
stayed
with
the
blacksmith
till
a
boat
came
and
i
returned
to
my
house
there
was
no
trace
of
wall
or
roof
or
floor
naught
but
a
patch
of
slimy
mud
judge
therefore
sahib
how
far
the
river
must
have
risen
it
was
written
that
i
should
not
die
either
in
my
house
or
in
the
heart
of
the
barhwi
or
under
the
wreck
of
the
barhwi
bridge
for
god
sent
down
hirnam
singh
two
days
dead
though
i
know
not
how
the
man
died
to
be
my
buoy
and
support
hirnam
singh
has
been
in
hell
these
twenty
years
and
the
thought
of
that
night
must
be
the
flower
of
his
torment
listen
sahib
the
river
has
changed
its
voice
it
is
going
to
sleep
before
the
dawn
to
which
there
is
yet
one
hour
with
the
light
it
will
come
down
afresh
how
do
i
know
have
i
been
here
thirty
years
without
knowing
the
voice
of
the
river
as
a
father
knows
the
voice
of
his
son
every
moment
it
is
talking
less
angrily
i
swear
that
there
will
be
no
danger
for
one
hour
or
perhaps
two
i
can
not
answer
for
the
morning
be
quick
sahib
i
will
call
ram
pershad
and
he
will
not
turn
back
this
time
is
the
paulin
tightly
corded
upon
all
the
baggage
with
a
mud
head
the
elephant
for
the
sahib
and
tell
them
on
the
far
side
that
there
will
be
no
crossing
after
daylight
money
nay
sahib
i
am
not
of
that
kind
no
not
even
to
give
sweetmeats
to
the
my
house
look
you
is
empty
and
i
am
an
old
man
ram
pershad
dutt
dutt
good
luck
go
with
you
sahib
the
sending
of
dana
da
when
the
devil
rides
on
your
chest
remember
the
once
upon
a
time
some
people
in
india
made
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
out
of
broken
a
missing
brooch
or
two
and
a
these
were
hidden
under
bushes
or
stuffed
into
holes
in
the
hillside
and
an
entire
civil
service
of
subordinate
gods
used
to
find
or
mend
them
again
and
every
one
said
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
are
dreamt
of
in
our
philosophy
several
other
things
happened
also
but
the
religion
never
seemed
to
get
much
beyond
its
first
manifestations
though
it
added
an
postal
service
and
orchestral
effects
in
order
to
keep
abreast
of
the
tunes
and
choke
off
competition
this
religion
was
too
elastic
for
ordinary
use
it
stretched
itself
and
embraced
pieces
of
everything
that
the
of
all
ages
have
manufactured
it
approved
of
and
stole
from
freemasonry
looted
the
rosicrucians
of
half
their
pet
words
took
any
fragments
of
egyptian
philosophy
that
it
found
in
the
annexed
as
many
of
the
vedas
as
had
been
translated
into
french
or
english
and
talked
of
all
the
rest
built
in
the
german
versions
of
what
is
left
of
the
zend
avesta
encouraged
white
gray
and
black
magic
including
spiritualism
palmistry
by
cards
hot
chestnuts
nuts
and
tallow
droppings
would
have
adopted
voodoo
and
oboe
had
it
known
anything
about
them
and
showed
itself
in
every
way
one
of
the
most
accommodating
arrangements
that
had
ever
been
invented
since
the
birth
of
the
sea
when
it
was
in
thorough
working
order
with
all
the
machinery
down

complete
dana
da
came
from
nowhere
with
nothing
in
his
hands
and
wrote
a
chapter
in
its
history
which
has
hitherto
been
unpublished
he
said
that
his
first
name
was
dana
and
his
second
was
da
now
setting
aside
dana
of
the
new
york
dana
is
a
bhil
name
and
da
fits
no
native
of
india
unless
you
except
the
bengali
de
as
the
original
spelling
da
is
lap
or
finnish
and
dana

nor

known

he
was
simply
dana
da
and
declined
to
give
further
information
for
the
sake
of
brevity
and
as
roughly
indicating
his
origin
he
was
called
native
he
might
have
been
the
original
old
man
of
the
mountains
who
is
said
to
be
the
only
authorised
head
of
the
creed
some
people
said
that
he
was
but
dana
da
used
to
smile
and
deny
any
connection
with
the
cult
explaining
that
he
was
an
experimenter
as
i
have
said
he
came
from
nowhere
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
studied
the
creed
for
three
weeks
sitting
at
the
feet
of
those
best
competent
to
explain
its
mysteries
then
he
laughed
aloud
and
went
away
but
the
laugh
might
have
been
either
of
devotion
or
derision
when
he
returned
he
was
without
money
but
his
pride
was
unabated
he
declared
that
he
knew
more
about
the
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
those
who
taught
him
and
for
this
contumacy
was
abandoned
altogether
his
next
appearance
in
public
life
was
at
a
big
cantonment
in
upper
india
and
he
was
then
telling
fortunes
with
the
help
of
three
leaden
dice
a
very
dirty
old
cloth
and
a
little
tin
box
of
opium
pills
he
told
better
fortunes
when
he
was
allowed
half
a
bottle
of
whiskey
but
the
things
which
he
invented
on
the
opium
were
quite
worth
the
money
he
was
in
reduced
circumstances
among
other
people
he
told
the
fortune
of
an
englishman
who
had
once
been
interested
in
the
simla
creed
but
who
later
on
had
married
and
forgotten
all
his
old
knowledge
in
the
study
of
babies
and
things
the
englishman
allowed
dana
da
to
tell
a
fortune
for
charity
sake
and
gave
him
five
rupees
a
dinner
and
some
old
clothes
when
he
had
eaten
dana
da
professed
gratitude
and
asked
if
there
were
anything
he
could
do
for
his
host
in
the
esoteric
line
there
any
one
that
you
love
said
dana
da
the
englishman
loved
his
wife
but
had
no
desire
to
drag
her
name
into
the
conversation
he
therefore
shook
his
head
there
any
one
that
you
hate
said
dana
da
the
englishman
said
that
there
were
several
men
whom
he
hated
deeply
good
said
dana
da
upon
whom
the
whiskey
and
the
opium
were
beginning
to
tell
give
me
their
names
and
i
will
despatch
a
sending
to
them
and
kill
them
now
a
sending
is
a
horrible
arrangement
first
invented
they
say
in
iceland
it
is
a
thing
sent
by
a
wizard
and
may
take
any
form
but
most
generally
wanders
about
the
land
in
the
shape
of
a
little
purple
cloud
till
it
finds
the
sendee
and
him
it
kills
by
changing
into
the
form
of
a
horse
or
a
cat
or
a
man
without
a
face
it
is
not
strictly
a
native
patent
though
of
the
skin
and
hide
castes
can
if
irritated
despatch
a
sending
which
sits
on
the
breast
of
their
enemy
by
night
and
nearly
kills
him
very
few
natives
care
to
irritate
for
this
reason
me
despatch
a
sending
said
dana
da
am
nearly
dead
now
with
want
and
drink
and
opium
but
i
should
like
to
kill
a
man
before
i
die
i
can
send
a
sending
anywhere
you
choose
and
in
any
form
except
in
the
shape
of
a
man
the
englishman
had
no
friends
that
he
wished
to
kill
but
partly
to
soothe
dana
da
whose
eyes
were
rolling
and
partly
to
see
what
would
be
done
he
asked
whether
a
modified
sending
could
not
be
arranged
for
such
a
sending
as
should
make
a
man
life
a
burden
to
him
and
yet
do
him
no
harm
if
this
were
possible
he
notified
his
willingness
to
give
dana
da
ten
rupees
for
the
job
am
not
what
i
was
once
said
dana
da
i
must
take
the
money
because
i
am
poor
to
what
englishman
shall
i
send
it
a
sending
to
lone
sahib
said
the
englishman
naming
a
man
who
had
been
most
bitter
in
rebuking
him
for
his
apostasy
from
the
creed
dana
da
laughed
and
nodded
could
have
chosen
no
better
man
myself
said
he
will
see
that
he
finds
the
sending
about
his
path
and
about
his
bed
he
lay
down
on
the
turned
up
the
whites
of
his
eyes
shivered
all
over
and
began
to
snort
this
was
magic
or
opium
or
the
sending
or
all
three
when
he
opened
his
eyes
he
vowed
that
the
sending
had
started
upon
the
and
was
at
that
moment
flying
up
to
the
town
where
lone
sahib
lives
me
my
ten
rupees
said
dana
da
wearily
write
a
letter
to
lone
sahib
telling
him
and
all
who
believe
with
him
that
you
and
a
friend
are
using
a
power
greater
than
theirs
they
will
see
that
you
are
speaking
the
truth
he
departed
unsteadily
with
the
promise
of
some
more
rupees
if
anything
came
of
the
sending
the
englishman
sent
a
letter
to
lone
sahib
couched
in
what
he
remembered
of
the
terminology
of
the
creed
he
wrote
also
in
the
days
of
what
you
held
to
be
my
backsliding
have
obtained
enlightenment
and
with
enlightenment
has
come
power
then
he
grew
so
deeply
mysterious
that
the
recipient
of
the
letter
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
and
was
proportionately
impressed
for
he
fancied
that
his
friend
had
become
a
when
a
man
is
a
he
can
do
more
than
slade
and
houdin
combined
lone
sahib
read
the
letter
in
five
different
fashions
and
was
beginning
a
sixth
interpretation
when
his
bearer
dashed
in
with
the
news
that
there
was
a
cat
on
the
bed
now
if
there
was
one
thing
that
lone
sahib
hated
more
than
another
it
was
a
cat
he
scolded
the
bearer
for
not
turning
it
out
of
the
house
the
bearer
said
that
he
was
afraid
all
the
doors
of
the
bedroom
had
been
shut
throughout
the
morning
and
no
cat
could
possibly
have
entered
the
room
he
would
prefer
not
to
meddle
with
the
creature
lone
sahib
entered
the
room
gingerly
and
there
on
the
pillow
of
his
bed
sprawled
and
whimpered
a
wee
white
kitten
not
a
jumpsome
frisky
little
beast
but
a
crawler
with
its
eyes
barely
opened
and
its
paws
lacking
strength
or
direction
a
kitten
that
ought
to
have
been
in
a
basket
with
its
mamma
lone
sahib
caught
it
by
the
scruff
of
its
neck
handed
it
over
to
the
sweeper
to
be
drowned
and
fined
the
bearer
four
annas
that
evening
as
he
was
reading
in
his
room
he
fancied
that
he
saw
something
moving
about
on
the
outside
the
circle
of
light
from
his
when
the
thing
began
to
myowl
he
realised
that
it
was
a
kitten
a
wee
white
kitten
nearly
blind
and
very
miserable
he
was
seriously
angry
and
spoke
bitterly
to
his
bearer
who
said
that
there
was
no
kitten
in
the
room
when
he
brought
in
the
lamp
and
kittens
of
tender
age
generally
had
in
attendance
the
presence
will
go
out
into
the
veranda
and
listen
said
the
bearer
will
hear
no
cats
how
therefore
can
the
kitten
on
the
bed
and
the
kitten
on
the
be
real
kittens
lone
sahib
went
out
to
listen
and
the
bearer
followed
him
but
there
was
no
sound
of
any
one
mewing
for
her
children
he
returned
to
his
room
having
hurled
the
kitten
down
the
hillside
and
wrote
out
the
incidents
of
the
day
for
the
benefit
of
his
those
people
were
so
absolutely
free
from
superstition
that
they
ascribed
anything
a
little
out
of
the
common
to
agencies
as
it
was
their
business
to
know
all
about
the
agencies
they
were
on
terms
of
almost
indecent
familiarity
with
manifestations
of
every
kind
their
letters
dropped
from
the
ceiling
unstamped
and
spirits
used
to
squatter
up
and
down
their
staircases
all
night
but
they
had
never
come
into
contact
with
kittens
lone
sahib
wrote
out
the
facts
noting
the
hour
and
the
minute
as
every
psychical
observer
is
bound
to
do
and
appending
the
englishman
letter
because
it
was
the
most
mysterious
document
and
might
have
had
a
bearing
upon
anything
in
this
world
or
the
next
an
outsider
would
have
translated
all
the
tangle
thus
out
you
laughed
at
me
once
and
now
i
am
going
to
make
you
sit
up
lone
sahib
found
that
meaning
in
it
but
their
translation
was
refined
and
full
of
words
they
held
a
sederunt
and
were
filled
with
tremulous
joy
for
in
spite
of
their
familiarity
with
all
the
other
worlds
and
cycles
they
had
a
very
human
awe
of
things
sent
from
they
met
in
lone
sahib
room
in
shrouded
and
sepulchral
gloom
and
their
conclave
was
broken
up
by
a
clinking
among
the
on
the
mantelpiece
a
wee
white
kitten
nearly
blind
was
looping
and
writhing
itself
between
the
clock
and
the
candlesticks
that
stopped
all
investigations
or
doublings
here
was
the
manifestation
in
the
flesh
it
was
so
far
as
could
be
seen
devoid
of
purpose
but
it
was
a
manifestation
of
undoubted
authenticity
they
drafted
a
round
robin
to
the
englishman
the
backslider
of
old
days
adjuring
him
in
the
interests
of
the
creed
to
explain
whether
there
was
any
connection
between
the
embodiment
of
some
egyptian
god
or
other
i
have
forgotten
the
name
and
his
communication
they
called
the
kitten
ra
or
toth
or
tum
or
something
and
when
lone
sahib
confessed
that
the
first
one
had
at
his
most
misguided
instance
been
drowned
by
the
sweeper
they
said
consolingly
that
in
his
next
life
he
would
be
a
and
not
even
a
of
the
lowest
grade
these
words
may
not
be
quite
correct
but
they
accurately
express
the
sense
of
the
house
when
the
englishman
received
the
round
robin
it
came
by
post
he
was
startled
and
bewildered
he
sent
into
the
bazar
for
dana
da
who
read
the
letter
and
laughed
is
my
sending
said
he
told
you
i
would
work
well
now
give
me
another
ten
rupees
what
in
the
world
is
this
gibberish
about
egyptian
gods
asked
the
englishman
said
dana
da
with
a
hiccough
for
he
had
discovered
the
englishman
whiskey
bottle
and
cats
and
cats
never
was
such
a
sending
a
hundred
of
cats
now
give
me
ten
more
rupees
and
write
as
i
dictate
dana
da
letter
was
a
curiosity
it
bore
the
englishman
signature
and
hinted
at
cats
at
a
sending
of
cats
the
mere
words
on
paper
were
creepy
and
uncanny
to
behold
have
you
done
though
said
the
englishman
am
as
much
in
the
dark
as
ever
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
can
actually
send
this
absurd
sending
you
talk
about
for
yourself
said
dana
da
does
that
letter
mean
in
a
little
time
they
will
all
be
at
my
feet
and
yours
and
i
o

will

or

dana
da
knew
his
people
when
a
man
who
hates
cats
wakes
up
in
the
morning
and
finds
a
little
squirming
kitten
on
his
breast
or
puts
his
hand
into
his
and
finds
a
little
kitten
where
his
gloves
should
be
or
opens
his
trunk
and
finds
a
vile
kitten
among
his
or
goes
for
a
long
ride
with
his
mackintosh
strapped
on
his
and
shakes
a
little
squawling
kitten
from
its
folds
when
he
opens
it
or
goes
out
to
dinner
and
finds
a
little
blind
kitten
under
his
chair
or
stays
at
home
and
finds
a
writhing
kitten
under
the
quilt
or
wriggling
among
his
boots
or
hanging
head
downwards
in
his
or
being
mangled
by
his
terrier
in
the
veranda
when
such
a
man
finds
one
kitten
neither
more
nor
less
once
a
day
in
a
place
where
no
kitten
rightly
could
or
should
be
he
is
naturally
upset
when
he
dare
not
murder
his
daily
trove
because
he
believes
it
to
be
a
manifestation
an
emissary
an
embodiment
and
half
a
dozen
other
things
all
out
of
the
regular
course
of
nature
he
is
more
than
upset
he
is
actually
distressed
some
of
lone
sahib
thought
that
he
was
a
highly
favoured
individual
but
many
said
that
if
he
had
treated
the
first
kitten
with
proper
respect
as
suited
a
embodiment
all
this
trouble
would
have
been
averted
they
compared
him
to
the
ancient
mariner
but
none
the
less
they
were
proud
of
him
and
proud
of
the
englishman
who
had
sent
the
manifestation
they
did
not
call
it
a
sending
because
icelandic
magic
was
not
in
their
programme
after
sixteen
kittens
that
is
to
say
after
one
fortnight
for
there
were
three
kittens
on
the
first
day
to
impress
the
fact
of
the
sending
the
whole
camp
was
uplifted
by
a
letter
it
came
flying
through
a
the
old
man
of
the
mountains
the
head
of
all
the
creed
explaining
the
manifestation
in
the
most
beautiful
language
and
soaking
up
all
the
credit
of
it
for
himself
the
englishman
said
the
letter
was
not
there
at
all
he
was
a
backslider
without
power
or
asceticism
who
could
even
raise
a
table
by
force
of
volition
much
less
project
an
army
of
kittens
through
space
the
entire
arrangement
said
the
letter
was
strictly
orthodox
worked
and
sanctioned
by
the
highest
authorities
within
the
pale
of
the
creed
there
was
great
joy
at
this
for
some
of
the
weaker
brethren
seeing
that
an
outsider
who
had
been
working
on
independent
lines
could
create
kittens
whereas
their
own
rulers
had
never
gone
beyond
crockery
and
broken
at
best
were
showing
a
desire
to
break
line
on
their
own
trail
in
fact
there
was
the
promise
of
a
schism
a
second
round
robin
was
drafted
to
the
englishman
beginning
scoffer
and
ending
with
a
selection
of
curses
from
the
rites
of
mizraim
and
memphis
and
the
commination
of
jugana
who
was
a
upon
whose
name
an
upstart
once
traded
a
papal
excommunication
is
a
compared
to
the
commination
of
jugana
the
englishman
had
been
proved
under
the
hand
and
seal
of
the
old
man
of
the
mountains
to
have
appropriated
virtue
and
pretended
to
have
power
which
in
reality
belonged
only
to
the
supreme
head
naturally
the
round
robin
did
not
spare
him
he
handed
the
letter
to
dana
da
to
translate
into
decent
english
the
effect
on
dana
da
was
curious
at
first
he
was
furiously
angry
and
then
he
laughed
for
five
minutes
had
thought
he
said
they
would
have
come
to
me
in
another
week
i
would
have
shown
that
i
sent
the
sending
and
they
would
have
discrowned
the
old
man
of
the
mountains
who
has
sent
this
sending
of
mine
do
you
do
nothing
the
time
has
come
for
me
to
act
write
as
i
dictate
and
i
will
put
them
to
shame
but
give
me
ten
more
rupees
at
dana
da
dictation
the
englishman
wrote
nothing
less
than
a
formal
challenge
to
the
old
man
of
the
mountains
it
wound
up
if
this
manifestation
be
from
your
hand
then
let
it
go
forward
but
if
it
be
from
my
hand
i
will
that
the
sending
shall
cease
in
two
days
time
in
that
day
there
shall
be
twelve
kittens
and
thenceforward
none
at
all
the
people
shall
judge
between
us
this
was
signed
by
dana
da
who
added
pentacles
and
pentagrams
and
a
and
half
a
dozen
and
a
triple
tau
to
his
name
just
to
show
that
he
was
all
he
laid
claim
to
be
the
challenge
was
read
out
to
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
and
they
remembered
then
that
dana
da
had
laughed
at
them
some
years
ago
it
was
officially
announced
that
the
old
man
of
the
mountains
would
treat
the
matter
with
contempt
dana
da
being
an
independent
investigator
without
a
single
at
the
back
of
him
but
this
did
not
soothe
his
people
they
wanted
to
see
a
fight
they
were
very
human
for
all
their
spirituality
lone
sahib
who
was
really
being
worn
out
with
kittens
submitted
meekly
to
his
fate
he
felt
that
he
was
being
to
prove
the
power
of
dana
da
as
the
poet
says
when
the
stated
day
dawned
the
shower
of
kittens
began
some
were
white
and
some
were
tabby
and
all
were
about
the
same
loathsome
age
three
were
on
his
three
in
his
and
the
other
six
turned
up
at
intervals
among
the
visitors
who
came
to
see
the
prophecy
break
down
never
was
a
more
satisfactory
sending
on
the
next
day
there
were
no
kittens
and
the
next
day
and
all
the
other
days
were
kittenless
and
quiet
the
people
murmured
and
looked
to
the
old
man
of
the
mountains
for
an
explanation
a
letter
written
on
a
dropped
from
the
ceiling
but
every
one
except
lone
sahib
felt
that
letters
were
not
what
the
occasion
demanded
there
should
have
been
cats
there
should
have
been
cats
ones
the
letter
proved
conclusively
that
there
had
been
a
hitch
in
the
psychic
current
which
colliding
with
a
dual
identity
had
interfered
with
the
percipient
activity
all
along
the
main
line
the
kittens
were
still
going
on
but
owing
to
some
failure
in
the
developing
fluid
they
were
not
materialised
the
air
was
thick
with
letters
for
a
few
days
afterwards
unseen
hands
played
gluck
and
beethoven
on
and
but
all
men
felt
that
psychic
life
was
a
mockery
without
materialised
kittens
even
lone
sahib
shouted
with
the
majority
on
this
head
dana
da
letters
were
very
insulting
and
if
he
had
then
offered
to
lead
a
new
departure
there
is
no
knowing
what
might
not
have
happened
but
dana
da
was
dying
of
whiskey
and
opium
in
the
englishman
godown
and
had
small
heart
for
honours
have
been
put
to
shame
said
he
was
such
a
sending
it
has
killed
me
said
the
englishman
are
going
to
die
dana
da
and
that
sort
of
stuff
must
be
left
behind
i
admit
that
you
have
made
some
queer
things
come
about
tell
me
honestly
now
how
was
it
done
me
ten
more
rupees
said
dana
da
faintly
if
i
die
before
i
spend
them
bury
them
with
me
the
silver
was
counted
out
while
dana
da
was
fighting
with
death
his
hand
closed
upon
the
money
and
he
smiled
a
grim
smile
low
he
whispered
the
englishman
bent
expelled
peddler
ceylon
all
mine
english
education
and
made
up
name
dana
da
england
with
american
man
and
and
you
gave
me
ten
rupees
several
times
i
gave
the
sahib
bearer
a
month
for
cats
little
little
cats
i
wrote
and
he
put
them
about
very
clever
man
very
few
kittens
now
in
the
ask
lone
sweeper
wife
so
saying
dana
da
gasped
and
passed
away
into
a
land
where
if
all
be
true
there
are
no
materialisations
and
the
making
of
new
creeds
is
discouraged
but
consider
the
gorgeous
simplicity
of
it
all
on
the
city
wall
then
she
let
them
down
by
a
cord
through
the
window
for
her
house
was
upon
the
and
she
dwelt
upon
the
ii
lalun
is
a
member
of
the
most
ancient
profession
in
the
world
lilith
was
her
and
that
was
before
the
days
of
eve
as
every
one
knows
in
the
west
people
say
rude
things
about
profession
and
write
lectures
about
it
and
distribute
the
lectures
to
young
persons
in
order
that
morality
may
be
preserved
in
the
east
where
the
profession
is
hereditary
descending
from
mother
to
daughter
nobody
writes
lectures
or
takes
any
notice
and
that
is
a
distinct
proof
of
the
inability
of
the
east
to
manage
its
own
affairs
lalun
real
husband
for
even
ladies
of
lalun
profession
in
the
east
must
have
husbands
was
a
big
her
mamma
who
had
married
a
spent
ten
thousand
rupees
on
lalun
wedding
which
was
blessed
by
clergymen
of
mamma
church
and
distributed
five
thousand
rupees
in
charity
to
the
poor
and
that
was
the
custom
of
the
land
the
advantages
of
having
a
for
a
husband
are
obvious
you
can
not
hurt
his
feelings
and
he
looks
imposing
lalun
husband
stood
on
the
plain
outside
the
city
walls
and
house
was
upon
the
east
wall
facing
the
river
if
you
fell
from
the
broad
you
dropped
thirty
feet
sheer
into
the
city
ditch
but
if
you
stayed
where
you
should
and
looked
forth
you
saw
all
the
cattle
of
the
city
being
driven
down
to
water
the
students
of
the
government
college
playing
cricket
the
high
grass
and
trees
that
fringed
the
the
great
sand
bars
that
ribbed
the
river
the
red
tombs
of
dead
emperors
beyond
the
river
and
very
far
away
through
the
blue
a
glint
of
the
snows
of
the
himalayas
wali
dad
used
to
lie
in
the
for
hours
at
a
time
watching
this
view
he
was
a
young
muhammadan
who
was
suffering
acutely
from
education
of
the
english
variety
and
knew
it
his
father
had
sent
him
to
a
to
get
wisdom
and
wali
dad
had
absorbed
more
than
ever
his
father
or
the
missionaries
intended
he
should
when
his
father
died
wali
dad
was
independent
and
spent
two
years
experimenting
with
the
creeds
of
the
earth
and
reading
books
that
are
of
no
use
to
anybody
after
he
had
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
enter
the
roman
catholic
church
and
the
presbyterian
fold
at
the
same
time
the
missionaries
found
him
out
and
called
him
names
but
they
did
not
understand
his
trouble
he
discovered
lalun
on
the
city
wall
and
became
the
most
constant
of
her
few
admirers
he
possessed
a
head
that
english
artists
at
home
would
rave
over
and
paint
amid
impossible
surroundings
a
face
that
female
novelists
would
use
with
delight
through
nine
hundred
pages
in
reality
he
was
only
a
young
muhammadan
with
pencilled
nostrils
little
feet
and
hands
and
a
very
tired
look
in
his
eyes
by
virtue
of
his
years
he
had
grown
a
neat
black
beard
which
he
stroked
with
pride
and
kept
delicately
scented
his
life
seemed
to
be
divided
between
borrowing
books
from
me
and
making
love
to
lalun
in
the
he
composed
songs
about
her
and
some
of
the
songs
are
sung
to
this
day
in
the
city
from
the
street
of
the
to
the
ward
one
song
the
prettiest
of
all
says
that
the
beauty
of
lalun
was
so
great
that
it
troubled
the
hearts
of
the
british
government
and
caused
them
to
lose
their
peace
of
mind
that
is
the
way
the
song
is
sung
in
the
streets
but
if
you
examine
it
carefully
and
know
the
key
to
the
explanation
you
will
find
that
there
are
three
puns
in
it
on
and
of
mind
so
that
it
runs
the
subtlety
of
lalun
the
administration
of
the
government
was
troubled
and
it
lost
such
and
such
a
man
when
wali
dad
sings
that
song
his
eyes
glow
like
hot
coals
and
lalun
leans
back
among
the
cushions
and
throws
bunches
of
at
wali
dad
but
first
it
is
necessary
to
explain
something
about
the
supreme
government
which
is
above
all
and
below
all
and
behind
all
gentlemen
come
from
england
spend
a
few
weeks
in
india
walk
round
this
great
sphinx
of
the
plains
and
write
books
upon
its
ways
and
its
works
denouncing
or
praising
it
as
their
own
ignorance
prompts
consequently
all
the
world
knows
how
the
supreme
government
conducts
itself
but
no
one
not
even
the
supreme
government
knows
everything
about
the
administration
of
the
empire
year
by
year
england
sends
out
fresh
drafts
for
the
first
which
is
officially
called
the
indian
civil
service
these
die
or
kill
themselves
by
overwork
or
are
worried
to
death
or
broken
in
health
and
hope
in
order
that
the
land
may
be
protected
from
death
and
sickness
famine
and
war
and
may
eventually
become
capable
of
standing
alone
it
will
never
stand
alone
but
the
idea
is
a
pretty
one
and
men
are
willing
to
die
for
it
and
yearly
the
work
of
pushing
and
coaxing
and
scolding
and
petting
the
country
into
good
living
goes
forward
if
an
advance
be
made
all
credit
is
given
to
the
native
while
the
englishmen
stand
back
and
wipe
their
foreheads
if
a
failure
occurs
the
englishmen
step
forward
and
take
the
blame
overmuch
tenderness
of
this
kind
has
bred
a
strong
belief
among
many
natives
that
the
native
is
capable
of
administering
the
country
and
many
devout
englishmen
believe
this
also
because
the
theory
is
stated
in
beautiful
english
with
all
the
latest
political
colour
there
be
other
men
who
though
uneducated
see
visions
and
dream
dreams
and
they
too
hope
to
administer
the
country
in
their
own
way
that
is
to
say
with
a
garnish
of
red
sauce
such
men
must
exist
among
two
hundred
million
people
and
if
they
are
not
attended
to
may
cause
trouble
and
even
break
the
great
idol
called
which
as
the
newspapers
say
lives
between
peshawur
and
cape
comorin
were
the
day
of
doom
to
dawn
you
would
find
the
supreme
government
measures
to
allay
popular
excitement
and
putting
guards
upon
the
graveyards
that
the
dead
might
troop
forth
orderly
the
youngest
civilian
would
arrest
gabriel
on
his
own
responsibility
if
the
archangel
could
not
produce
a
deputy
commissioner
permission
to
music
or
other
noises
as
the
license
says
whence
it
is
easy
to
see
that
mere
men
of
the
flesh
who
would
create
a
tumult
must
fare
badly
at
the
hands
of
the
supreme
government
and
they
do
there
is
no
outward
sign
of
excitement
there
is
no
confusion
there
is
no
knowledge
when
due
and
sufficient
reasons
have
been
given
weighed
and
approved
the
machinery
moves
forward
and
the
dreamer
of
dreams
and
the
seer
of
visions
is
gone
from
his
friends
and
following
he
enjoys
the
hospitality
of
government
there
is
no
restriction
upon
his
movements
within
certain
limits
but
he
must
not
confer
any
more
with
his
brother
dreamers
once
in
every
six
months
the
supreme
government
assures
itself
that
he
is
well
and
takes
formal
acknowledgment
of
his
existence
no
one
protests
against
this
detention
because
the
few
people
who
know
about
it
are
in
deadly
fear
of
seeming
to
know
him
and
never
a
single
newspaper
up
his
case
or
organises
demonstrations
on
his
behalf
because
the
newspapers
of
india
have
got
behind
that
lying
proverb
which
says
the
pen
is
mightier
than
the
sword
and
can
walk
delicately
so
now
you
know
as
much
as
you
ought
about
wali
dad
the
educational
mixture
and
the
supreme
government
lalun
has
not
yet
been
described
she
would
need
so
wali
dad
says
a
thousand
pens
of
gold
and
ink
scented
with
musk
she
has
been
variously
compared
to
the
moon
the
dil
sagar
lake
a
spotted
quail
a
gazelle
the
sun
on
the
desert
of
kutch
the
dawn
the
stars
and
the
young
bamboo
these
comparisons
imply
that
she
is
beautiful
exceedingly
according
to
the
native
standards
which
are
practically
the
same
as
those
of
the
west
her
eyes
are
black
and
her
hair
is
black
and
her
eyebrows
are
black
as
leeches
her
mouth
is
tiny
and
says
witty
things
her
hands
are
tiny
and
have
saved
much
money
her
feet
are
tiny
and
have
trodden
on
the
naked
hearts
of
many
men
but
as
wali
dad
sings
lalun
and
when
you
have
said
that
you
have
only
come
to
the
beginnings
of
knowledge
the
little
house
on
the
city
wall
was
just
big
enough
to
hold
lalun
and
her
maid
and
a
with
a
silver
collar
a
big
pink
and
blue
chandelier
hung
from
the
ceiling
of
the
reception
room
a
petty
nawab
had
given
lalun
the
horror
and
she
kept
it
for
sake
the
floor
of
the
room
was
of
polished
chunam
white
as
curds
a
latticed
window
of
carved
wood
was
set
in
one
wall
there
was
a
profusion
of
squabby
pluffy
cushions
and
fat
carpets
everywhere
and
lalun
silver
studded
with
turquoises
had
a
special
little
carpet
all
to
its
shining
self
wali
dad
was
nearly
as
permanent
a
fixture
as
the
chandelier
as
i
have
said
he
lay
in
the
and
meditated
on
life
and
death
and
lalun
specially
lalun
the
feet
of
the
young
men
of
the
city
tended
to
her
doorways
and
then
retired
for
lalun
was
a
particular
maiden
slow
of
speech
reserved
of
mind
and
not
in
the
least
inclined
to
orgies
which
were
nearly
certain
to
end
in
strife
i
am
of
no
value
i
am
unworthy
of
this
honour
said
lalun
i
am
of
value
they
are
unworthy
of
me
and
that
was
a
crooked
sentence
in
the
long
hot
nights
of
latter
april
and
may
all
the
city
seemed
to
assemble
in
lalun
little
white
room
to
smoke
and
to
talk
shiahs
of
the
grimmest
and
most
uncompromising
persuasion
sufis

had
lost
all
belief
in
the

and
retained

little

these

and
more
also
you
might
find
in
the
white
room
wali
dad
lay
in
the
and
listened
to
the
talk
is
lalun
said
wali
dad
to
me
it
is
electic
is
not
that
the
word
outside
of
a
freemason
lodge
i
have
never
seen
such
gatherings
i
dined
once
with
a
yahoudi
he
spat
into
the
city
ditch
with
apologies
for
allowing
national
feelings
to
overcome
him
i
have
lost
every
belief
in
the
world
said
he
try
to
be
proud
of
my
losing
i
can
not
help
hating
a
jew
lalun
admits
no
jews
here
what
in
the
world
do
all
these
men
do
i
asked
curse
of
our
country
said
wali
dad
talk
it
is
like
the
athenians
always
hearing
and
telling
some
new
thing
ask
the
pearl
and
she
will
show
you
how
much
she
knows
of
the
news
of
the
city
and
the
province
lalun
knows
everything
i
said
at
random
she
was
talking
to
a
gentleman
of
the
kurd
persuasion
who
had
come
in
from
does
the
regiment
go
to
agra
does
not
go
at
all
said
lalun
without
turning
her
head
have
ordered
the
to
go
in
its
stead
that
regiment
goes
to
lucknow
in
three
months
unless
they
give
a
fresh
order
is
so
said
wali
dad
without
a
shade
of
doubt
you
with
your
telegrams
and
your
newspapers
do
better
always
hearing
and
telling
some
new
thing
he
went
on
friend
has
your
god
ever
smitten
a
european
nation
for
gossiping
in
the
bazars
india
has
gossiped
for
centuries
always
standing
in
the
bazars
until
the
soldiers
go
by
therefore
you
are
here
today
instead
of
starving
in
your
own
country
and
i
am
not
a
muhammadan
i
am
a
product
a
demnition
product
that
also
i
owe
to
you
and
yours
that
i
can
not
make
an
end
to
my
sentence
without
quoting
from
your
authors
he
pulled
at
the
and
mourned
half
feelingly
half
in
earnest
for
the
shattered
hopes
of
his
youth
wali
dad
was
always
mourning
over
something
or
other
the
country
of
which
he
despaired
or
the
creed
in
which
he
had
lost
faith
or
the
life
of
the
english
which
he
could
by
no
means
understand
lalun
never
mourned
she
played
little
songs
on
the
and
to
hear
her
sing
peacock
cry
again
was
always
a
fresh
pleasure
she
knew
all
the
songs
that
have
ever
been
sung
from
the
of
the
south
that
make
the
old
men
angry
with
the
young
men
and
the
young
men
angry
with
the
state
to
the
of
the
north
where
the
swords
like
angry
kites
in
the
pauses
between
the
kisses
and
the
passes
fill
with
armed
men
and
the
lover
is
torn
from
his
beloved
and
cries
ai
ai
evermore
she
knew
how
to
make
up
tobacco
for
the
so
that
it
smelt
like
the
gates
of
paradise
and
wafted
you
gently
through
them
she
could
embroider
strange
things
in
gold
and
silver
and
dance
softly
with
the
moonlight
when
it
came
in
at
the
window
also
she
knew
the
hearts
of
men
and
the
heart
of
the
city
and
whose
wives
were
faithful
and
whose
untrue
and
more
of
the
secrets
of
the
government
offices
than
are
good
to
be
set
down
in
this
place
nasiban
her
maid
said
that
her
jewellery
was
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
and
that
some
night
a
thief
would
enter
and
murder
her
for
its
possession
but
lalun
said
that
all
the
city
would
tear
that
thief
limb
from
limb
and
that
he
whoever
he
was
knew
it
so
she
took
her
and
sat
in
the
and
sang
a
song
of
old
days
that
had
been
sung
by
a
girl
of
her
profession
in
an
armed
camp
on
the
eve
of
a
great
battle
the
day
before
the
fords
of
the
jumna
ran
red
and
sivaji
fled
fifty
miles
to
delhi
with
a
toorkh
stallion
at
his
horse
tail
and
another
lalun
on
his
it
was
what
men
call
a
mahratta
and
it
said
their
warrior
forces
chimajee
before
the
peishwa
led
the
children
of
the
sun
and
fire
behind
him
turned
and
fled
and
the
chorus
said
with
them
there
fought
who
rides
so
free
with
a
sword
and
turban
red
the
who
earns
his
fee
at
peril
of
his
head
peril
of
his
head
said
wali
dad
in
english
to
me
to
your
government
all
our
heads
are
protected
and
with
the
educational
facilities
at
my
command
his
eyes
twinkled
wickedly
might
be
a
distinguished
member
of
the
local
administration
perhaps
in
time
i
might
even
be
a
member
of
a
legislative
council
speak
english
said
lalun
bending
over
her
afresh
the
chorus
went
out
from
the
city
wall
to
the
blackened
wall
of
fort
amara
which
dominates
the
city
no
man
knows
the
precise
extent
of
fort
amara
three
kings
built
it
hundreds
of
years
ago
and
they
say
that
there
are
miles
of
underground
rooms
beneath
its
walls
it
is
peopled
with
many
ghosts
a
detachment
of
garrison
artillery
and
a
company
of
infantry
in
its
prime
it
held
ten
thousand
men
and
filled
its
ditches
with
corpses
peril
of
his
head
sang
lalun
again
and
again
a
head
moved
on
one
of
the
ramparts
the
gray
head
of
an
old
man
and
a
voice
rough
as
on
a
sent
back
the
last
line
of
the
chorus
and
broke
into
a
song
that
i
could
not
understand
though
lalun
and
wali
dad
listened
intently
is
it
i
asked
is
it
consistent
man
said
wali
dad
fought
you
in
when
he
was
a
refought
you
in
and
he
tried
to
fight
you
in
but
you
had
learned
the
trick
of
blowing
men
from
guns
too
well
now
he
is
old
but
he
would
still
fight
if
he
could
he
a
wahabi
then
why
should
he
answer
to
a
mahratta
if
he
be
wahabi
or
sikh
said
i
do
not
know
said
wali
dad
has
lost
perhaps
his
religion
perhaps
he
wishes
to
be
a
king
perhaps
he
is
a
king
i
do
not
know
his
name
is
a
lie
wali
dad
if
you
know
his
career
you
must
know
his
name
is
quite
true
i
belong
to
a
nation
of
liars
i
would
rather
not
tell
you
his
name
think
for
yourself
lalun
finished
her
song
pointed
to
the
fort
and
said
simply
singh
said
wali
dad
the
pearl
chooses
to
tell
you
the
pearl
is
a
fool
i
translated
to
lalun
who
laughed
choose
to
tell
what
i
choose
to
tell
they
kept
khem
singh
in
burma
said
she
kept
him
there
for
many
years
until
his
mind
was
changed
in
him
so
great
was
the
kindness
of
the
government
finding
this
they
sent
him
back
to
his
own
country
that
he
might
look
upon
it
before
he
died
he
is
an
old
man
but
when
he
looks
upon
this
country
his
memory
will
come
moreover
there
be
many
who
remember
him
is
an
interesting
survival
said
wali
dad
pulling
at
the
returns
to
a
country
now
full
of
educational
and
political
reform
but
as
the
pearl
says
there
are
many
who
remember
him
he
was
once
a
great
man
there
will
never
be
any
more
great
men
in
india
they
will
all
when
they
are
boys
go
whoring
after
strange
gods
and
they
will
become
citizens
illustrious
what
is
it
that
the
native
papers
call
them
wali
dad
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
bad
temper
lalun
looked
out
of
the
window
and
smiled
into
the
i
went
away
thinking
about
khem
singh
who
had
once
made
history
with
a
thousand
followers
and
would
have
been
a
princeling
but
for
the
power
of
the
supreme
government
aforesaid
the
senior
captain
commanding
fort
amara
was
away
on
leave
but
the
subaltern
his
deputy
had
drifted
down
to
the
club
where
i
found
him
and
enquired
of
him
whether
it
was
really
true
that
a
political
prisoner
had
been
added
to
the
attractions
of
the
fort
the
explained
at
great
length
for
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
held
command
of
the
fort
and
his
glory
lay
heavy
upon
him
said
he
man
was
sent
in
to
me
about
a
week
ago
from
down
the
line
a
thorough
gentleman
whoever
he
is
of
course
i
did
all
i
could
for
him
he
had
his
two
servants
and
some
silver
and
he
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
native
officer
i
called
him
subadar
sahib
just
as
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
look
here
subadar
sahib
i
said
you
handed
over
to
my
authority
and
i
supposed
to
guard
you
now
i
do
want
to
make
your
life
hard
but
you
must
make
things
easy
for
me
all
the
fort
is
at
your
disposal
from
the
flagstaff
to
the
dry
ditch
and
i
shall
be
happy
to
entertain
you
in
any
way
i
can
but
you
must
take
advantage
of
it
give
me
your
word
that
you
wo
try
to
escape
subadar
sahib
and
i
give
you
my
word
that
you
shall
have
no
heavy
guard
put
over
i
thought
the
best
way
of
getting
at
him
was
by
going
at
him
straight
and
it
was
by
jove
the
old
man
gave
me
his
word
and
moved
about
the
fort
as
contented
as
a
sick
crow
he
a
rummy
chap
always
asking
to
be
told
where
he
is
and
what
the
buildings
about
him
are
i
had
to
sign
a
slip
of
blue
paper
when
he
turned
up
acknowledging
receipt
of
his
body
and
all
that
and
i
responsible
that
he
does
get
away
queer
thing
though
looking
after
a
johnnie
old
enough
to
be
your
grandfather
is
it
come
to
the
fort
one
of
these
days
and
see
him
for
reasons
which
will
appear
i
never
went
to
the
fort
while
khem
singh
was
then
within
its
walls
i
knew
him
only
as
a
gray
head
seen
from
lalun
window
a
gray
head
and
a
harsh
voice
but
natives
told
me
that
day
by
day
as
he
looked
upon
the
fair
lands
round
amara
his
memory
came
back
to
him
and
with
it
the
old
hatred
against
the
government
that
had
been
nearly
effaced
in
burma
so
he
raged
up
and
down
the
west
face
of
the
fort
from
morning
till
noon
and
from
evening
till
the
night
devising
vain
things
in
his
heart
and
croaking
when
lalun
sang
on
the
city
wall
as
he
grew
more
acquainted
with
the
subaltern
he
unburdened
his
old
heart
of
some
of
the
passions
that
had
withered
it
he
used
to
say
tapping
his
stick
against
the
parapet
i
was
a
young
man
i
was
one
of
twenty
thousand
horsemen
who
came
out
of
the
city
and
rode
round
the
plain
here
sahib
i
was
the
leader
of
a
hundred
then
of
a
thousand
then
of
five
thousand
and
now
he
pointed
to
his
two
servants
from
the
beginning
to
i
would
cut
the
throats
of
all
the
sahibs
in
the
land
if
i
could
hold
me
fast
sahib
lest
i
get
away
and
return
to
those
who
would
follow
me
i
forgot
them
when
i
was
in
burma
but
now
that
i
am
in
my
own
country
again
i
remember
everything
you
remember
that
you
have
given
me
your
honour
not
to
make
your
tendance
a
hard
matter
said
the
subaltern
to
you
only
to
you
sahib
said
khem
singh
you
because
you
are
of
a
pleasant
countenance
if
my
turn
comes
again
sahib
i
will
not
hang
you
nor
cut
your
throat
you
said
the
subaltern
gravely
as
he
looked
along
the
line
of
guns
that
could
pound
the
city
to
powder
in
half
an
hour
us
go
into
our
own
quarters
khem
singh
come
and
talk
with
me
after
dinner
khem
singh
would
sit
on
his
own
cushion
at
the
subaltern
feet
drinking
heavy
scented
brandy
in
great
gulps
and
telling
strange
stories
of
fort
amara
which
had
been
a
palace
in
the
old
days
of
begums
and
ranees
tortured
to
death
aye
in
the
very
vaulted
chamber
that
now
served
as
a
would
tell
stories
of
sobraon
that
made
the
subaltern
cheeks
flush
and
tingle
with
pride
of
race
and
of
the
kuka
rising
from
which
so
much
was
expected
and
the
foreknowledge
of
which
was
shared
by
a
hundred
thousand
souls
but
he
never
told
tales
of
because
as
he
said
he
was
the
subaltern
guest
and
is
a
year
that
no
man
black
or
white
cares
to
speak
of
once
only
when
the
brandy
had
slightly
affected
his
head
he
said
speaking
now
of
a
matter
which
lay
between
sobraon
and
the
affair
of
the
kukas
it
was
ever
a
wonder
to
us
that
you
stayed
your
hand
at
all
and
that
having
stayed
it
you
did
not
make
the
land
one
prison
now
i
hear
from
without
that
you
do
great
honour
to
all
men
of
our
country
and
by
your
own
hands
are
destroying
the
terror
of
your
name
which
is
your
strong
rock
and
defence
this
is
a
foolish
thing
will
oil
and
water
mix
now
in
was
not
born
then
subadar
sahib
said
the
subaltern
and
khem
singh
reeled
to
his
quarters
the
subaltern
would
tell
me
of
these
conversations
at
the
club
and
my
desire
to
see
khem
singh
increased
but
wali
dad
sitting
in
the
of
the
house
on
the
city
wall
said
that
it
would
be
a
cruel
thing
to
do
and
lalun
pretended
that
i
preferred
the
society
of
a
grizzled
old
sikh
to
hers
is
tobacco
here
is
talk
here
are
many
friends
and
all
the
news
of
the
city
and
above
all
here
is
myself
i
will
tell
you
stories
and
sing
you
songs
and
wali
dad
will
talk
his
english
nonsense
in
your
ears
is
that
worse
than
watching
the
caged
animal
yonder
go
then
if
you
must
but
such
and
such
an
one
will
be
here
and
he
will
speak
of
wonderful
things
it
happened
that
never
came
and
the
warm
heat
of
the
latter
rains
gave
place
to
the
chill
of
early
october
almost
before
i
was
aware
of
the
flight
of
the
year
the
captain
commanding
the
fort
returned
from
leave
and
took
over
charge
of
khem
singh
according
to
the
laws
of
seniority
the
captain
was
not
a
nice
man
he
called
all
natives
which
besides
being
extreme
bad
form
shows
gross
ignorance
the
use
of
telling
off
two
tommies
to
watch
that
old
nigger
said
he
fancy
it
soothes
his
vanity
said
the
subaltern
men
are
ordered
to
keep
well
out
of
his
way
but
he
takes
them
as
a
tribute
to
his
importance
poor
old
wretch
wo
have
line
men
taken
off
regular
guards
in
this
way
put
on
a
couple
of
native
infantry
said
the
subaltern
lifting
his
eyebrows
pathans
dogras
they
all
alike
these
black
vermin
and
the
captain
talked
to
khem
singh
in
a
manner
which
hurt
that
old
feelings
fifteen
years
before
when
he
had
been
caught
for
the
second
time
every
one
looked
upon
him
as
a
sort
of
tiger
he
liked
being
regarded
in
this
light
but
he
forgot
that
the
world
goes
forward
in
fifteen
years
and
many
subalterns
are
promoted
to
captaincies
is
in
charge
of
the
fort
said
khem
singh
to
his
native
guard
every
morning
and
the
native
guard
said
subadar
sahib
in
deference
to
his
age
and
his
air
of
distinction
but
they
did
not
know
who
he
was
in
those
days
the
gathering
in
lalun
little
white
room
was
always
large
and
talked
more
than
before
greeks
said
wali
dad
who
had
been
borrowing
my
books
inhabitants
of
the
city
of
athens
where
they
were
always
hearing
and
telling
some
new
thing
rigorously
secluded
their
women
who
were
fools
hence
the
glorious
institution
of
the
heterodox
women
is
it
not
who
were
amusing
and
fools
all
the
greek
philosophers
delighted
in
their
company
tell
me
my
friend
how
it
goes
now
in
greece
and
the
other
places
upon
the
continent
of
europe
are
your
also
fools
dad
i
said
never
speak
to
us
about
your
and
we
never
speak
about
ours
to
you
that
is
the
bar
between
us
said
wali
dad
is
curious
to
think
that
our
common
should
be
here
in
the
house
of
a
common
how
do
you
call
he
pointed
with
the
to
lalun
is
nothing
but
lalun
i
said
and
that
was
perfectly
true
if
you
took
your
place
in
the
world
wali
dad
and
gave
up
dreaming
dreams
might
wear
an
english
coat
and
trouser
i
might
be
a
leading
muhammadan
pleader
i
might
be
received
even
at
the
where
the
english
stand
on
one
side
and
the
natives
on
the
other
in
order
to
promote
social
intercourse
throughout
the
empire
heart
heart
said
he
to
lalun
quickly
sahib
says
that
i
ought
to
quit
you
sahib
is
always
talking
stupid
talk
returned
lalun
with
a
laugh
this
house
i
am
a
queen
and
thou
art
a
king
the
sahib
she
put
her
arms
above
her
head
and
thought
for
a
moment
sahib
shall
be
our
vizier
thine
and
mine
wali
dad
because
he
has
said
that
thou
shouldst
leave
me
wali
dad
laughed
immoderately
and
i
laughed
too
it
so
said
he
friend
are
you
willing
to
take
this
lucrative
government
appointment
lalun
what
shall
his
pay
be
but
lalun
began
to
sing
and
for
the
rest
of
the
time
there
was
no
hope
of
getting
a
sensible
answer
from
her
or
wali
dad
when
the
one
stopped
the
other
began
to
quote
persian
poetry
with
a
triple
pun
in
every
other
line
some
of
it
was
not
strictly
proper
but
it
was
all
very
funny
and
it
only
came
to
an
end
when
a
fat
person
in
black
with
gold
sent
up
his
name
to
lalun
and
wali
dad
dragged
me
into
the
twinkling
night
to
walk
in
a
big
and
talk
heresies
about
religion
and
governments
and
a
man
career
in
life
the
mohurrum
the
great
of
the
muhammadans
was
close
at
hand
and
the
things
that
wali
dad
said
about
religious
fanaticism
would
have
secured
his
expulsion
from
the
muslim
sect
there
were
the
round
us
the
stars
above
us
and
from
every
quarter
of
the
city
came
the
boom
of
the
big
mohurrum
drums
you
must
know
that
the
city
is
divided
in
fairly
equal
proportions
between
the
hindus
and
the
musalmans
and
where
both
creeds
belong
to
the
fighting
races
a
big
religious
festival
gives
ample
chance
for
trouble
when
they
can
that
is
to
say
when
the
authorities
are
weak
enough
to
allow
it
the
hindus
do
their
best
to
arrange
some
minor
of
their
own
in
time
to
clash
with
the
period
of
general
mourning
for
the
martyrs
hasan
and
hussain
the
heroes
of
the
mohurrum
gilt
and
painted
paper
presentations
of
their
tombs
are
borne
with
shouting
and
wailing
music
torches
and
yells
through
the
principal
thoroughfares
of
the
city
which
fakements
are
called
their
passage
is
rigorously
laid
down
beforehand
by
the
police
and
detachments
of
police
accompany
each
lest
the
hindus
should
throw
bricks
at
it
and
the
peace
of
the
queen
and
the
heads
of
her
loyal
subjects
should
thereby
be
broken
mohurrum
time
in
a
town
means
anxiety
to
all
the
officials
because
if
a
riot
breaks
out
the
officials
and
not
the
rioters
are
held
responsible
the
former
must
foresee
everything
and
while
not
making
their
precautions
ridiculously
elaborate
must
see
that
they
are
at
least
adequate
to
the
drums
said
wali
dad
is
the
heart
of
the
people
empty
and
making
much
noise
how
think
you
will
the
mohurrum
go
this
year
think
that
there
will
be
trouble
he
turned
down
a
and
left
me
alone
with
the
stars
and
a
sleepy
police
patrol
then
i
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
that
wali
dad
had
sacked
the
city
and
i
was
made
vizier
with
lalun
silver
for
mark
of
office
all
day
the
mohurrum
drums
beat
in
the
city
and
all
day
deputations
of
tearful
hindu
gentlemen
besieged
the
deputy
commissioner
with
assurances
that
they
would
be
murdered
ere
next
dawning
by
the
muhammadans
said
the
deputy
commissioner
in
confidence
to
the
head
of
police
a
pretty
fair
indication
that
the
hindus
are
going
to
make
unpleasant
i
think
we
can
arrange
a
little
surprise
for
them
i
have
given
the
heads
of
both
creeds
fair
warning
if
they
choose
to
disregard
it
so
much
the
worse
for
them
there
was
a
large
gathering
in
lalun
house
that
night
but
of
men
that
i
had
never
seen
before
if
i
except
the
fat
gentleman
in
black
with
the
gold
wali
dad
lay
in
the
more
bitterly
scornful
of
his
faith
and
its
manifestations
than
i
had
ever
known
him
lalun
maid
was
very
busy
cutting
up
and
mixing
tobacco
for
the
guests
we
could
hear
the
thunder
of
the
drums
as
the
processions
accompanying
each
marched
to
the
central
in
the
plain
outside
the
city
preparatory
to
their
triumphant
and
circuit
within
the
walls
all
the
streets
seemed
ablaze
with
torches
and
only
fort
amara
was
black
and
silent
when
the
noise
of
the
drums
ceased
no
one
in
the
white
room
spoke
for
a
time
first
has
moved
off
said
wali
dad
looking
to
the
plain
is
very
early
said
the
man
with
the
is
only
eight
the
company
rose
and
departed
of
them
were
men
from
ladakh
said
lalun
when
the
last
had
gone
brought
me
such
as
the
russians
sell
and
a
from
peshawur
show
me
now
how
the
english
make
tea
the
was
abominable
when
it
was
finished
wali
dad
suggested
going
into
the
streets
am
nearly
sure
that
there
will
be
trouble
he
said
the
city
thinks
so
and
is
as
the
babus
say
now
i
tell
you
that
at
the
corner
of
the
padshahi
gate
you
will
find
my
horse
all
this
night
if
you
want
to
go
about
and
to
see
things
it
is
a
most
disgraceful
exhibition
where
is
the
pleasure
of
saying
hasan
ya
twenty
thousand
times
in
a
night
all
the
processions
there
were
two
and
twenty
of
them
were
now
well
within
the
city
walls
the
drums
were
beating
afresh
the
crowd
were
howling
hasan
ya
hussain
and
beating
their
breasts
the
brass
bands
were
playing
their
loudest
and
at
every
corner
where
space
allowed
muhammadan
preachers
were
telling
the
lamentable
story
of
the
death
of
the
martyrs
it
was
impossible
to
move
except
with
the
crowd
for
the
streets
were
not
more
than
twenty
feet
wide
in
the
hindu
quarters
the
shutters
of
all
the
shops
were
up
and
as
the
first
a
gorgeous
erection
ten
feet
high
was
borne
aloft
on
the
shoulders
of
a
score
of
stout
men
into
the
of
the
gully
of
the
horsemen
a
brickbat
crashed
through
its
talc
and
tinsel
sides
thy
hands
o
lord
murmured
wali
dad
profanely
as
a
yell
went
up
from
behind
and
a
native
officer
of
police
jammed
his
horse
through
the
crowd
another
brickbat
followed
and
the
staggered
and
swayed
where
it
had
stopped
on
in
the
name
of
the
go
forward
shouted
the
policeman
but
there
was
an
ugly
cracking
and
splintering
of
shutters
and
the
crowd
halted
with
oaths
and
growlings
before
the
house
whence
the
brickbat
had
been
thrown
then
without
any
warning
broke
the
storm
not
only
in
the
gully
of
the
horsemen
but
in
half
a
dozen
other
places
the
rocked
like
ships
at
sea
the
long
dipped
and
rose
round
them
while
the
men
shouted
hindus
are
dishonouring
the
strike
strike
into
their
temples
for
the
faith
the
six
or
eight
policemen
with
each
drew
their
batons
and
struck
as
long
as
they
could
in
the
hope
of
forcing
the
mob
forward
but
they
were
overpowered
and
as
contingents
of
hindus
poured
into
the
streets
the
fight
became
general
half
a
mile
away
where
the
were
yet
untouched
the
drums
and
the
shrieks
of
hasanl
ya
hussain
continued
but
not
for
long
the
priests
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
knocked
the
legs
from
the
bedsteads
that
supported
their
pulpits
and
smote
for
the
faith
while
stones
fell
from
the
silent
houses
upon
friend
and
foe
and
the
packed
streets
bellowed
din
din
a
caught
fire
and
was
dropped
for
a
flaming
barrier
between
hindu
and
musalman
at
the
corner
of
the
gully
then
the
crowd
surged
forward
and
wali
dad
drew
me
close
to
the
stone
pillar
of
a
well
was
intended
from
the
beginning
he
shouted
in
my
ear
with
more
heat
than
blank
unbelief
should
be
guilty
of
bricks
were
carried
up
to
the
houses
beforehand
these
swine
of
hindus
we
shall
be
gutting
kine
in
their
temples
after
some
burning
others
torn
to
pieces
hurried
past
us
and
the
mob
with
them
howling
shrieking
and
striking
at
the
house
doors
in
their
flight
at
last
we
saw
the
reason
of
the
rush
hugonin
the
assistant
district
superintendent
of
police
a
boy
of
twenty
had
got
together
thirty
constables
and
was
forcing
the
crowd
through
the
streets
his
old
gray
showed
no
sign
of
uneasiness
as
it
was
spurred
into
the
crowd
and
the
long
with
which
he
had
armed
himself
was
never
still
know
we
have
enough
police
to
hold
he
cried
as
he
passed
me
mopping
a
cut
on
his
face
we
have
are
any
of
the
men
from
the
club
coming
down
to
help
get
on
you
sons
of
burnt
fathers
the
cracked
across
the
writhing
backs
and
the
constables
smote
afresh
with
baton
and
with
these
passed
the
lights
and
the
shouting
and
wali
dad
began
to
swear
under
his
breath
from
fort
amara
shot
up
a
single
rocket
then
two
side
by
side
it
was
the
signal
for
troops
petitt
the
deputy
commissioner
covered
with
dust
and
sweat
but
calm
and
gently
smiling
cantered
up
the
street
in
rear
of
the
main
body
of
the
rioters
one
killed
yet
he
shouted
keep
on
the
run
till
dawn
do
let
halt
hugonin
trot
about
till
the
troops
come
the
science
of
the
defence
lay
solely
in
keeping
the
mob
on
the
move
if
they
had
they
would
halt
and
fire
a
house
and
then
the
work
of
restoring
order
would
be
more
difficult
to
say
the
least
of
it
flames
have
the
same
effect
on
a
crowd
as
blood
has
on
a
wild
beast
word
had
reached
the
club
and
men
in
were
beginning
to
show
themselves
and
lend
a
hand
in
heading
off
and
breaking
up
the
shouting
masses
with
whips
or
staves
they
were
not
very
often
attacked
for
the
rioters
had
sense
enough
to
know
that
the
death
of
a
european
would
not
mean
one
hanging
but
many
and
possibly
the
appearance
of
the
artillery
the
clamour
in
the
city
redoubled
the
hindus
had
descended
into
the
streets
in
real
earnest
and
ere
long
the
mob
returned
it
was
a
strange
sight
there
were
no
only
their
riven
platforms
and
there
were
no
police
here
and
there
a
city
dignitary
hindu
or
muhammadan
was
vainly
imploring
his
to
keep
quiet
and
behave
themselves
advice
for
which
his
white
beard
was
pulled
then
a
native
officer
of
police
unhorsed
but
still
using
his
spurs
with
effect
would
be
borne
along
warning
all
the
crowd
of
the
danger
of
insulting
the
government
everywhere
men
struck
aimlessly
with
sticks
grasping
each
other
by
the
throat
howling
and
foaming
with
rage
or
beat
with
their
bare
hands
on
the
doors
of
the
houses
is
a
lucky
thing
that
they
are
fighting
with
natural
weapons
i
said
to
wali
dad
we
should
have
half
the
city
killed
i
turned
as
i
spoke
and
looked
at
his
face
his
nostrils
were
distended
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
he
was
smiting
himself
softly
on
the
breast
the
crowd
poured
by
with
renewed
riot
a
gang
of
musalmans
by
some
hundred
hindu
fanatics
wali
dad
left
my
side
with
an
oath
and
shouting
hasan
ya
hussain
plunged
into
the
thick
of
the
fight
where
i
lost
sight
of
him
i
fled
by
a
side
alley
to
the
padshahi
gate
where
i
found
wali
house
and
thence
rode
to
the
fort
once
outside
the
city
wall
the
tumult
sank
to
a
dull
roar
very
impressive
under
the
stars
and
reflecting
great
credit
on
the
fifty
thousand
angry
men
who
were
making
it
the
troops
who
at
the
deputy
commissioner
instance
had
been
ordered
to
rendezvous
quietly
near
the
fort
showed
no
signs
of
being
impressed
two
companies
of
native
infantry
a
squadron
of
native
cavalry
and
a
company
of
british
infantry
were
kicking
their
heels
in
the
shadow
of
the
east
face
waiting
for
orders
to
march
in
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
they
were
all
pleased
unholily
pleased
at
the
chance
of
what
they
called
little
fun
the
senior
officers
to
be
sure
grumbled
at
having
been
kept
out
of
bed
and
the
english
troops
pretended
to
be
sulky
but
there
was
joy
in
the
hearts
of
all
the
subalterns
and
whispers
ran
up
and
down
the
line
what
a
beastly
shame
think
the
beggars
will
really
stand
up
to
us
i
shall
meet
my
there
i
owe
him
more
than
i
can
afford
they
wo
let
us
even
unsheathe
swords
up
goes
the
fourth
rocket
fall
in
there
the
garrison
artillery
who
to
the
last
cherished
a
wild
hope
that
they
might
be
allowed
to
bombard
the
city
at
a
hundred
yards
range
lined
the
parapet
above
the
east
gateway
and
cheered
themselves
hoarse
as
the
british
infantry
doubled
along
the
road
to
the
main
gate
of
the
city
the
cavalry
cantered
on
to
the
padshahi
gate
and
the
native
infantry
marched
slowly
to
the
gate
of
the
butchers
the
surprise
was
intended
to
be
of
a
distinctly
unpleasant
nature
and
to
come
on
top
of
the
defeat
of
the
police
who
had
been
just
able
to
keep
the
muhammadans
from
firing
the
houses
of
a
few
leading
hindus
the
bulk
of
the
riot
lay
in
the
north
and
wards
the
east
and
were
by
this
time
dark
and
silent
and
i
rode
hastily
to
lalun
house
for
i
wished
to
tell
her
to
send
some
one
in
search
of
wali
dad
the
house
was
unlighted
but
the
door
was
open
and
i
climbed
upstairs
in
the
darkness
one
small
lamp
in
the
white
room
showed
lalun
and
her
maid
leaning
half
out
of
the
window
breathing
heavily
and
evidently
pulling
at
something
that
refused
to
come
art
late
very
late
gasped
lalun
without
turning
her
head
us
now
o
fool
if
thou
hast
not
spent
thy
strength
howling
among
the
pull
nasiban
and
i
can
do
no
more
o
sahib
is
it
you
the
hindus
have
been
hunting
an
old
muhammadan
round
the
ditch
with
clubs
if
they
find
him
again
they
will
kill
him
help
us
to
pull
him
up
i
put
my
hands
to
the
long
red
silk
that
was
hanging
out
of
the
window
and
we
three
pulled
and
pulled
with
all
the
strength
at
our
command
there
was
something
very
heavy
at
the
end
and
it
swore
in
an
unknown
tongue
as
it
kicked
against
the
city
wall
oh
pull
said
lalun
at
the
last
a
pair
of
brown
hands
grasped
the
and
a
venerable
muhammadan
tumbled
upon
the
floor
very
much
out
of
breath
his
jaws
were
tied
up
his
turban
had
fallen
over
one
eye
and
he
was
dusty
and
angry
lalun
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
for
an
instant
and
said
something
about
wali
dad
that
i
could
not
catch
then
to
my
extreme
gratification
she
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
murmured
pretty
things
i
was
in
no
haste
to
stop
her
and
nasiban
being
a
handmaiden
of
tact
turned
to
the
big
that
stands
in
the
corner
of
the
white
room
and
rummaged
among
the
contents
the
muhammadan
sat
on
the
floor
and
glared
service
more
sahib
since
thou
hast
come
so
opportunely
said
lalun
thou
it
is
very
nice
to
be
by
lalun
this
old
man
across
the
city
the
troops
are
everywhere
and
they
might
hurt
him
for
he
is
old
to
the
kumharsen
gate
there
i
think
he
may
find
a
carriage
to
take
him
to
his
house
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
thou
art
more
than
a
friend
therefore
i
ask
this
nasiban
bent
over
the
old
man
tucked
something
into
his
belt
and
i
raised
him
up
and
led
him
into
the
streets
in
crossing
from
the
east
to
the
west
of
the
city
there
was
no
chance
of
avoiding
the
troops
and
the
crowd
long
before
i
reached
the
gully
of
the
horsemen
i
heard
the
shouts
of
the
british
infantry
crying
cheeringly
ye
beggars
hutt
ye
devils
get
along
go
forward
there
then
followed
the
ringing
of
and
shrieks
of
pain
the
troops
were
banging
the
bare
toes
of
the
mob
with
their
for
not
a
bayonet
had
been
fixed
my
companion
mumbled
and
jabbered
as
we
walked
on
until
we
were
carried
back
by
the
crowd
and
had
to
force
our
way
to
the
troops
i
caught
him
by
the
wrist
and
felt
a
bangle
there
the
iron
bangle
of
the
sikhs
but
i
had
no
suspicions
for
lalun
had
only
ten
minutes
before
put
her
arms
round
me
thrice
we
were
carried
back
by
the
crowd
and
when
we
made
our
way
past
the
british
infantry
it
was
to
meet
the
sikh
cavalry
driving
another
mob
before
them
with
the
butts
of
their
lances
are
these
dogs
said
the
old
man
of
the
cavalry
father
i
said
and
we
edged
our
way
up
the
line
of
horses
two
abreast
and
found
the
deputy
commissioner
his
helmet
smashed
on
his
head
surrounded
by
a
knot
of
men
who
had
come
down
from
the
club
as
amateur
constables
and
had
helped
the
police
mightily
keep
on
the
run
till
dawn
said
petitt
your
villainous
friend
i
had
only
time
to
say
the
protection
of
the
when
a
fresh
crowd
flying
before
the
native
infantry
carried
us
a
hundred
yards
nearer
to
the
kumharsen
gate
and
petitt
was
swept
away
like
a
shadow
do
not
know
i
can
not
see
this
is
all
new
to
me
moaned
my
companion
many
troops
are
there
in
the
city
five
hundred
i
said
lakh
of
men
beaten
by
five
hundred
and
sikhs
among
them
surely
surely
i
am
an
old
man
but
the
kumharsen
gate
is
new
who
pulled
down
the
stone
lions
where
is
the
conduit
sahib
i
am
a
very
old
man
and
alas
i
i
can
not
stand
he
dropped
in
the
shadow
of
the
kumharsen
gate
where
there
was
no
disturbance
a
fat
gentleman
wearing
gold
came
out
of
the
darkness
are
most
kind
to
my
old
friend
he
said
suavely
is
a
landholder
of
akala
he
should
not
be
in
a
big
city
when
there
is
religious
excitement
but
i
have
a
carriage
here
you
are
quite
truly
kind
will
you
help
me
to
put
him
into
the
carriage
it
is
very
late
we
bundled
the
old
man
into
a
hired
victoria
that
stood
close
to
the
gate
and
i
turned
back
to
the
house
on
the
city
wall
the
troops
were
driving
the
people
to
and
fro
while
the
police
shouted
your
houses
get
to
your
houses
and
the
of
the
assistant
district
superintendent
cracked
remorselessly
clung
to
the
stirrups
of
the
cavalry
crying
that
their
houses
had
been
robbed
which
was
a
lie
and
the
burly
sikh
horsemen
patted
them
on
the
shoulder
and
bade
them
return
to
those
houses
lest
a
worse
thing
should
happen
parties
of
five
or
six
british
soldiers
joining
arms
swept
down
the
their
rifles
on
their
backs
stamping
with
shouting
and
song
upon
the
toes
of
hindu
and
musalman
never
was
religious
enthusiasm
more
systematically
squashed
and
never
were
poor
breakers
of
the
peace
more
utterly
weary
and
footsore
they
were
routed
out
of
holes
and
corners
from
behind
and
byres
and
bidden
to
go
to
their
houses
if
they
had
no
houses
to
go
to
so
much
the
worse
for
their
toes
on
returning
to
lalun
door
i
stumbled
over
a
man
at
the
threshold
he
was
sobbing
hysterically
and
his
arms
flapped
like
the
wings
of
a
goose
it
was
wali
dad
agnostic
and
unbeliever
shoeless
turbanless
and
frothing
at
the
mouth
the
flesh
on
his
chest
bruised
and
bleeding
from
the
vehemence
with
which
he
had
smitten
himself
a
broken
lay
by
his
side
and
his
quivering
lips
murmured
hasan
ya
hussain
as
i
stooped
over
him
i
pushed
him
a
few
steps
up
the
staircase
threw
a
pebble
at
lalun
city
window
and
hurried
home
most
of
the
streets
were
very
still
and
the
cold
wind
that
comes
before
the
dawn
whistled
down
them
in
the
centre
of
the
square
of
the
mosque
a
man
was
bending
over
a
corpse
the
skull
had
been
smashed
in
by
or
is
expedient
that
one
man
should
die
for
the
people
said
petitt
grimly
raising
the
shapeless
head
brutes
were
beginning
to
show
their
teeth
too
much
and
from
afar
we
could
hear
the
soldiers
singing
lovely
black
eyes
as
they
drove
the
remnant
of
the
rioters
within
doors
of
course
you
can
guess
what
happened
i
was
not
so
clever
when
the
news
went
abroad
that
khem
singh
had
escaped
from
the
fort
i
did
not
since
i
was
then
living
this
story
not
writing
it
connect
myself
or
lalun
or
the
fat
gentleman
with
the
gold
with
his
disappearance
nor
did
it
strike
me
that
wali
dad
was
the
man
who
should
have
convoyed
him
across
the
city
or
that
lalun
arms
round
my
neck
were
put
there
to
hide
the
money
that
nasiban
gave
to
khem
singh
and
that
lalun
had
used
me
and
my
white
face
as
even
a
better
safeguard
than
wali
dad
who
proved
himself
so
untrustworthy
all
that
i
knew
at
the
time
was
that
when
fort
amara
was
taken
up
with
the
riots
khem
singh
profited
by
the
confusion
to
get
away
and
that
his
two
sikh
guards
also
escaped
but
later
on
i
received
full
enlightenment
and
so
did
khem
singh
he
fled
to
those
who
knew
him
in
the
old
days
but
many
of
them
were
dead
and
more
were
changed
and
all
knew
something
of
the
wrath
of
the
government
he
went
to
the
young
men
but
the
glamour
of
his
name
had
passed
away
and
they
were
entering
native
regiments
of
government
offices
and
khem
singh
could
give
them
neither
pension
decorations
nor
influence
nothing
but
a
glorious
death
with
their
backs
to
the
mouth
of
a
gun
he
wrote
letters
and
made
promises
and
the
letters
fell
into
bad
hands
and
a
wholly
insignificant
subordinate
officer
of
police
tracked
them
down
and
gained
promotion
thereby
moreover
khem
singh
was
old
and
brandy
was
scarce
and
he
had
left
his
silver
in
fort
amara
with
his
nice
warm
bedding
and
the
gentleman
with
the
gold
was
told
by
those
who
had
employed
him
that
khem
singh
as
a
popular
leader
was
not
worth
the
money
paid
is
the
mercy
of
these
fools
of
english
said
khem
singh
when
the
situation
was
put
before
him
will
go
back
to
fort
amara
of
my
own
free
will
and
gain
honour
give
me
good
clothes
to
return
in
so
at
his
own
time
khem
singh
knocked
at
the
of
the
fort
and
walked
to
the
captain
and
the
subaltern
who
were
nearly
on
account
of
correspondence
that
daily
arrived
from
simla
marked
have
come
back
captain
sahib
said
khem
singh
no
more
guards
over
me
it
is
no
good
out
yonder
a
week
later
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
to
my
knowledge
and
he
made
as
though
there
were
an
understanding
between
us
was
well
done
sahib
said
he
greatly
i
admired
your
astuteness
in
thus
boldly
facing
the
troops
when
i
whom
they
would
have
doubtless
torn
to
pieces
was
with
you
now
there
is
a
man
in
fort
ooltagarh
whom
a
bold
man
could
with
ease
help
to
escape
this
is
the
position
of
the
fort
as
i
draw
it
on
the
sand
but
i
was
thinking
how
i
had
become
lalun
vizier
after
all
