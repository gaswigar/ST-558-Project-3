called
the
conductor
the
train
drew
up
at
a
platform
and
as
if
by
magic
a
stream
of
girls
came
pouring
out
of
the
pretty
stucco
station
with
its
sloping
red
roof
and
mingled
with
another
stream
of
girls
emptying
itself
from
the
coaches
everywhere
appeared
girls
leaping
from
omnibuses
hurrying
down
the
gravel
walk
from
the
village
hastening
along
the
university
drive
girls
on
foot
girls
on
bicycles
girls
running
and
girls
strolling
arm
in
arm
few
of
them
wore
hats
many
of
them
wore
sweaters
and
short
walking
skirts
of
white
duck
or
serge
and
across
the
front
of
each
sweater
was
embroidered
a
large
w
in
cadet
blue
the
mystic
color
of
wellington
university
in
the
midst
of
a
shouting
gesticulating
mob
stood
murphy
baggage
master
smiling
good
naturedly
now
young
ladies
one
at
a
time
please
we
brought
down
all
the
baggage
left
over
by
the
if
your
trunk
ai
on
this
train
come
on
the
next
all
in
good
time
please
a
tall
girl
with
auburn
hair
and
deep
blue
eyes
approached
the
group
there
was
a
kind
of
awkward
grace
about
her
the
grace
which
was
hers
by
rights
and
the
awkwardness
which
comes
of
growing
too
fast
she
wore
a
shabby
brown
homespun
suit
a
shade
darker
than
her
hair
and
on
her
head
was
an
old
brown
felt
which
had
plainly
seen
service
the
year
before
but
knotted
at
her
neck
was
a
tie
of
silk
which
seemed
to
draw
attention
away
from
the
shiny
seams
and
frayed
hem
and
to
cry
aloud
look
at
me
i
am
the
color
of
a
winter
sunset
never
mind
the
other
old
togs
surely
there
was
something
very
brave
and
jaunty
about
this
young
girl
who
now
pushed
her
way
through
the
crowd
of
students
and
endeavored
to
engage
the
attention
of
the
i
think
my
trunk
was
on
this
train
she
said
timidly
i
hope
it
is
it
came
from
louisville
to
philadelphia
safely
and
when
i
it
they
told
me
it
would
be
on
this
train
now
murphy
the
baggage
master
had
his
own
peculiar
method
of
conducting
business
and
it
was
strictly
a
partial
and
prejudiced
one
if
he
liked
the
face
of
a
student
he
always
waited
on
her
first
regardless
of
how
many
other
students
were
ahead
of
her
and
as
he
told
his
wife
later
he
took
a
fancy
to
that
overgrown
gal
from
the
fust
i
beg
your
pardon
but
murphy
is
engaged
put
in
a
haughty
looking
young
woman
with
black
eyes
that
snapped
angrily
now
miss
judith
said
the
baggage
master
who
knew
many
of
the
students
by
name
do
go
fer
to
git
excited
i
ai
made
no
promises
to
no
one
it
plain
to
see
this
here
young
lady
is
a
newcomer
and
as
sich
she
gits
my
fust
consideration
oh
please
excuse
me
said
the
girl
in
shabby
brown
i
not
used
to
i
mean
i
have
traveled
very
much
judith
turned
irritably
away
i
should
think
you
had
she
said
in
a
low
voice
but
loud
enough
to
be
overheard
freshies
have
a
lot
to
learn
and
one
is
to
respect
their
elders
the
new
girl
put
down
her
straw
suit
case
and
leaned
against
the
wall
of
the
station
she
looked
tired
and
there
was
a
streak
of
soot
across
her
cheek
the
trip
from
kentucky
in
this
warm
september
weather
was
not
the
pleasantest
journey
in
the
world
while
she
waited
for
murphy
to
return
with
news
of
her
trunk
her
attention
was
claimed
by
two
girls
standing
at
her
elbow
who
were
talking
cheerfully
together
yes
said
one
of
them
a
plump
girl
with
brown
hair
a
slightly
nose
and
a
humorous
twitch
to
her
lips
i
have
a
room
at
queen
cottage
it
the
best
i
could
do
unless
i
went
into
one
of
the
expensive
suites
in
the
dormitories
and
you
know
i
might
as
well
expect
to
take
the
royal
suite
on
the
mauretania
and
sail
for
europe
as
do
that
the
other
girl
laughed
you
be
quite
up
to
doing
anything
with
your
enterprising
ways
nance
oldham
she
exclaimed
oh
are
you
going
to
queen
cottage
here
broke
in
the
girl
in
shabby
brown
i
there
too
my
name
is
molly
brown
i
come
from
kentucky
i
feel
awfully
forlorn
and
homesick
arriving
at
the
university
station
without
knowing
a
soul
there
was
a
kind
of
ringing
note
to
molly
brown
voice
which
made
the
other
girls
listen
more
closely
i
wonder
if
she
does
sing
thought
nance
oldham
giving
her
a
quick
scrutinizing
glance
yes
i
am
at
queen
cottage
she
continued
aloud
but
that
about
all
i
can
tell
you
i
feel
like
a
greeny
too
we
soon
learn
i
suppose
this
is
miss
brinton
miss
brown
caroline
brinton
was
rather
a
nondescript
young
person
with
dreamy
eyes
and
an
manner
she
came
from
philadelphia
and
she
greeted
the
new
acquaintance
rather
coldly
your
trunk
ai
here
yet
miss
called
the
baggage
master
like
enough
it
come
on
the
molly
looked
disturbed
while
the
judith
standing
nearby
flashed
a
triumphant
smile
as
much
as
to
say
it
only
serves
you
right
for
pushing
in
out
of
turn
what
are
we
to
do
now
she
asked
of
her
new
friends
rather
helplessly
take
the
up
to
wellington
said
brisk
nance
oldham
i
know
that
much
there
one
filling
up
now
we
better
hurry
and
get
seats
the
three
girls
crowded
into
the
long
narrow
vehicle
already
half
filled
with
students
even
at
this
early
stage
in
their
acquaintance
the
bonds
of
loneliness
and
sympathy
had
drawn
them
together
i
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
molly
brown
had
confided
to
the
listening
ear
of
nance
oldham
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
be
homesick
i
really
did
know
what
the
feeling
was
like
because
i
have
never
had
a
chance
to
learn
but
i
know
now
it
a
kind
of
an
sensation
i
suppose
little
orphans
have
it
when
they
first
go
into
an
orphan
asylum
oh
you
soon
get
over
it
answered
nance
it
because
you
live
so
far
away
kentucky
did
you
say
molly
nodded
and
looked
the
other
way
the
memory
of
an
old
brick
house
with
broad
piazzas
and
many
windows
blurred
her
vision
for
a
moment
but
she
resolutely
pressed
her
lips
together
and
began
to
watch
the
passing
scenery
as
new
and
strange
to
her
as
the
scenery
in
a
foreign
land
the
road
leading
to
wellington
university
skirted
a
pretty
village
and
then
plunged
straight
into
the
country
between
rolling
meadow
lands
tinged
a
golden
brown
with
the
autumn
sun
and
there
in
the
distance
were
the
gray
towers
of
wellington
silhouetted
against
the
sky
like
a
medi√¶val
castle
molly
brown
clasped
her
hands
and
smiled
a
heavenly
smile
is
that
it
she
exclaimed
rapturously
it
must
be
answered
nance
who
also
felt
some
quiet
and
reserved
flutterings
it
is
said
miss
brinton
i
came
down
to
engage
my
room
so
i
know
in
the
meantime
there
was
a
busy
conversation
going
on
around
them
i
going
to
cut
gym
this
year
it
interferes
too
much
exclaimed
a
tiny
girl
with
birdlike
motions
and
intelligent
beady
little
eyes
as
bright
and
alert
as
the
eyes
of
a
little
brown
bird
but
evidently
molly
was
not
the
only
person
who
had
noticed
this
resemblance
for
one
of
the
students
called
out
now
jennie
wren
you
must
admit
that
gym
never
had
any
charms
for
you
and
it
a
great
relief
to
give
it
up
of
course
she
must
put
in
another
girl
the
only
exercise
jennie
wren
ever
takes
is
to
hop
about
on
the
lawn
and
prune
her
feathers
never
cried
jennie
wren
i
never
wear
them
not
even
quills
i
belong
to
the
c
a
is
there
much
life
here
asked
molly
brown
of
a
tall
somewhat
older
girl
sitting
opposite
her
this
new
girl
may
have
timid
manners
thought
nance
oldham
but
she
is
not
afraid
to
talk
to
strangers
i
suppose
that
the
friendly
southern
way
she
has
been
in
wellington
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
she
has
already
made
three
friends
caroline
and
the
and
me
and
now
she
getting
on
famously
with
that
older
girl
what
i
like
about
her
is
that
she
is
a
bit
and
she
takes
it
for
granted
everybody
going
to
be
kind
oh
yes
lots
of
it
the
older
girl
was
saying
to
molly
kindly
if
you
have
a
taste
for
that
kind
of
thing
you
may
indulge
it
to
your
heart
content
there
is
a
splendid
swimming
pool
attached
to
the
gym
and
there
are
golf
links
of
course
you
know
they
are
quite
famous
in
this
part
of
the
world
then
there
are
the
tennis
courts
and
still
have
some
canoeing
on
the
lake
before
the
weather
gets
too
cold
and
later
glorious
skating
besides
all
that
there
are
perfectly
ripping
walks
for
miles
around
the
college
has
several
saturday
afternoon
walking
clubs
but
do
these
things
interfere
with
with
lectures
asked
molly
who
was
really
quite
ignorant
regarding
college
life
although
she
had
passed
her
entrance
examinations
without
any
conditions
whatever
the
older
girl
laughed
pleasantly
she
was
not
good
looking
but
she
had
a
fine
face
and
molly
liked
her
immensely
oh
no
you
find
there
plenty
of
time
for
everything
you
want
to
get
in
because
most
things
have
their
season
and
most
girls
specialize
anyhow
a
golf
fiend
is
seldom
a
tennis
fiend
and
there
are
lots
of
walking
fiends
who
do
like
either
molly
liking
for
this
big
girl
and
her
grave
fine
face
increased
as
the
conversation
progressed
she
had
a
most
reassuring
kindly
manner
and
molly
noticed
that
the
other
girls
treated
her
with
a
kind
of
deferential
respect
and
called
her
miss
stewart
she
learned
afterward
that
miss
stewart
was
a
senior
and
a
member
of
the
octogons
the
most
coveted
society
in
the
university
she
led
in
all
the
athletic
sports
was
quite
a
wonderful
musician
and
had
composed
an
operetta
for
her
class
and
most
of
the
music
for
the
class
songs
it
was
whispered
also
that
she
was
very
rich
though
no
one
would
ever
have
guessed
this
secret
from
mary
stewart
herself
who
was
careful
never
to
allude
to
money
and
dressed
very
simply
and
plainly
the
omnibus
now
turned
into
the
avenue
which
led
to
the
college
campus
and
there
was
general
excitement
of
a
subdued
sort
among
the
new
girls
and
greetings
and
calls
from
the
older
girls
as
they
caught
glimpses
of
friends
strolling
on
the
lawn
queen
cottage
called
the
driver
and
molly
stood
up
promptly
shrinking
a
little
as
twenty
pairs
of
eyes
turned
curiously
in
her
direction
then
the
big
girl
leaned
over
and
took
her
hand
kindly
wo
you
look
me
up
she
said
my
name
is
mary
stewart
and
i
stop
at
no
on
the
quadrangle
perhaps
i
can
help
you
get
things
straightened
out
a
bit
and
show
you
the
ropes
oh
thank
you
said
molly
with
that
musical
ring
to
her
voice
which
never
failed
to
thrill
her
hearers
it
awfully
nice
of
you
what
time
shall
i
come
i
see
you
in
chapel
in
the
morning
and
we
fix
the
time
then
called
miss
stewart
as
molly
climbed
out
dragging
her
straw
telescope
over
the
knees
of
the
other
passengers
followed
by
nance
oldham
who
had
waited
for
her
to
take
the
initiative
as
the
two
girls
stood
watching
the
disappearing
vehicle
they
became
the
prey
to
the
most
extreme
loneliness
i
feel
as
if
i
had
just
left
the
tumbrel
on
the
way
to
my
execution
observed
molly
trying
to
laugh
although
the
corners
of
her
mouth
turned
persistently
down
but
anyway
i
glad
we
are
together
she
continued
slipping
her
arm
through
nance
queen
cottage
does
seem
so
remote
and
lonesome
does
it
just
a
thing
apart
the
two
girls
gazed
uncertainly
at
the
rather
shingled
house
stained
brown
and
covered
with
a
mantle
of
old
vines
which
appeared
to
have
been
prematurely
stripped
of
their
foliage
it
was
somewhat
isolated
at
least
it
seemed
so
at
first
the
next
house
was
quite
half
a
block
on
and
was
a
cheerful
place
all
stucco
and
red
roof
like
the
station
well
here
goes
molly
went
on
if
it
queen
why
then
so
be
it
and
she
marched
up
the
walk
and
rang
the
front
door
bell
which
resounded
through
the
hall
with
a
metallic
clang
shure
i
after
bein
wit
you
in
a
moment
called
a
voice
from
above
you
the
new
young
ladies
i
thinkin
and
glad
i
am
to
see
you
there
was
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
down
the
stairs
and
the
door
was
opened
by
murphy
wife
of
the
baggage
master
and
housekeeper
for
queen
cottage
she
was
a
irish
woman
with
a
round
face
and
she
beamed
on
the
girls
with
motherly
interest
as
she
ushered
them
into
the
parlor
since
ye
be
the
fust
comers
ye
may
be
the
fust
choosers
she
said
and
if
ye
be
friends
ye
may
like
to
be
roommates
surely
and
a
good
thing
it
better
to
room
with
a
friend
than
a
stranger
the
two
girls
looked
at
each
other
with
a
new
interest
it
had
not
occurred
to
them
that
they
might
be
roommates
but
had
not
they
already
with
the
swiftness
peculiar
to
girls
bridged
the
gulf
which
separates
total
strangers
and
were
now
on
the
very
verge
of
plunging
into
intimate
friendship
would
it
not
be
better
to
seize
this
opportunity
than
to
wait
for
other
chances
which
might
not
prove
so
agreeable
shall
we
not
asked
molly
with
that
charming
cordial
manner
which
appeared
to
win
her
friends
wherever
she
went
it
would
be
a
great
relief
answered
nance
who
was
yet
to
learn
the
value
of
showing
real
pleasure
when
she
felt
it
nevertheless
nance
under
her
whimsical
rather
sarcastic
outer
shell
had
a
warm
and
loyal
heart
thus
molly
brown
and
nance
oldham
quite
opposites
in
looks
and
temperaments
became
roommates
during
their
freshman
year
at
wellington
college
and
thus
from
this
small
beginning
the
seeds
of
a
friendship
were
sown
the
two
girls
chose
a
big
sunny
room
on
the
third
floor
looking
over
a
portion
of
the
golf
links
molly
liked
it
because
it
had
blue
wallpaper
and
nance
because
it
had
a
really
commodious
closet
chapter
ii
their
neighbor
molly
brown
was
the
youngest
member
of
a
numerous
family
of
older
brothers
and
sisters
her
father
had
been
dead
many
years
and
in
order
to
rear
and
educate
her
children
brown
had
been
obliged
to
mortgage
acre
by
acre
the
fine
old
place
where
molly
and
her
brothers
and
sisters
had
been
born
and
brought
up
every
time
anybody
in
the
brown
family
wanted
to
do
anything
that
was
particularly
nice
something
had
to
go
either
a
cow
or
a
colt
or
a
piece
of
land
according
to
the
needs
of
the
moment
a
lot
represented
molly
college
education
two
perfectly
good
acres
of
orchard
if
you
do
bring
back
at
least
one
golden
apple
in
return
for
all
these
nice
juicy
ones
that
are
going
for
your
education
molly
you
are
no
child
of
mine
brown
had
laughingly
exclaimed
when
she
kissed
her
daughter
i
bring
back
the
three
golden
apples
of
the
hesperides
mother
and
make
the
family
rich
and
happy
cried
molly
and
from
that
moment
the
three
golden
apples
became
a
secret
symbol
to
her
although
she
had
not
decided
in
her
mind
exactly
what
they
represented
but
as
molly
observed
to
herself
anybody
who
has
had
two
acres
of
winter
sweets
pippins
and
greenings
spent
on
her
must
necessarily
engage
to
win
a
few
those
two
fruitful
acres
however
while
they
provided
a
fund
for
an
education
did
not
extend
far
into
the
margin
and
there
was
little
left
for
clothes
that
was
perhaps
one
of
the
reasons
why
molly
had
felt
so
disturbed
about
the
delay
in
receiving
her
trunk
i
can
stand
traveling
in
this
old
brown
rag
for
economy
sake
she
thought
but
i
would
like
to
put
on
the
one
decent
thing
i
own
for
my
first
day
at
college
i
was
a
chump
not
to
have
brought
something
in
my
suit
case
besides
a
blouse
however
what
done
ca
be
undone
and
she
stoically
went
to
work
to
remove
the
stains
of
travel
and
put
on
a
fresh
blue
linen
shirtwaist
while
nance
oldham
who
had
been
more
made
herself
spic
and
span
in
a
duck
skirt
and
a
white
linen
blouse
she
had
little
to
say
during
the
process
of
making
her
toilet
and
molly
wondered
if
after
all
she
would
like
a
roommate
so
peculiarly
reserved
and
whimsical
as
this
new
friend
she
hoped
there
would
be
lots
of
nice
girls
in
the
house
of
the
right
sort
girls
who
meant
business
for
while
molly
meant
to
enjoy
herself
immensely
she
meant
business
decidedly
and
she
did
want
to
get
into
a
play
set
and
be
torn
away
from
her
studies
as
these
thoughts
flitted
through
her
mind
she
heard
voices
coming
up
the
stairs
now
murphy
i
do
hope
you
got
something
really
decent
you
know
i
had
expected
to
come
back
this
year
i
thought
i
would
stay
in
france
with
grandmamma
but
at
the
last
moment
i
changed
my
mind
and
i
come
right
here
from
the
ship
without
engaging
a
thing
at
all
take
anything
that
a
single
the
voice
had
a
spoiled
imperious
sound
like
that
of
a
person
in
the
habit
of
having
her
own
way
i
have
a
single
miss
but
it
a
small
one
and
they
do
say
you
got
a
deal
of
belongings
let
see
it
let
see
it
quick
granny
murphy
and
from
the
noise
without
our
two
young
persons
judged
that
this
despotic
stranger
had
placed
her
hands
on
murphy
shoulders
and
was
running
her
along
the
passage
now
you
be
giving
me
apoplexy
miss
surely
with
your
cried
the
woman
breathlessly
as
she
opened
the
door
next
theirs
who
in
there
two
freshies
yes
miss
they
only
just
arrived
an
hour
ago
greenies
from
greenville
green
county
chanted
the
young
woman
who
did
not
seem
to
mind
being
overheard
by
the
entire
household
very
well
i
take
this
little
i
wo
move
any
of
my
things
in
except
some
books
and
cushions
and
now
off
wit
yer
something
for
your
trouble
oh
thank
you
thank
you
miss
the
two
girls
seemed
to
hear
the
irish
woman
being
shoved
out
in
the
hall
then
the
door
was
banged
after
her
and
was
locked
dear
me
what
an
obstreperous
person
observed
nance
i
wonder
if
she
going
to
give
us
a
continuous
performance
i
do
know
answered
molly
she
be
a
noisy
neighbor
if
she
does
but
she
sounds
interesting
living
in
france
with
her
grandmamma
and
so
on
nance
glanced
at
her
watch
would
you
like
to
go
for
a
stroll
before
supper
we
have
an
hour
yet
i
dying
to
see
the
famous
quadrangle
and
the
cloisters
and
a
few
other
celebrated
spots
i
heard
about
are
you
and
incidentally
rub
off
a
little
of
our
greenness
said
molly
recalling
the
words
of
the
girl
next
door
as
the
two
girls
closed
the
door
to
their
room
and
paused
on
the
landing
the
door
adjoining
burst
open
and
a
human
whirlwind
blew
out
of
the
single
room
and
almost
knocked
them
over
i
beg
your
pardon
said
nance
stiffly
giving
the
human
whirlwind
a
long
cool
brown
glance
molly
a
little
behind
her
friend
examined
the
stranger
with
much
curiosity
she
could
not
quite
tell
why
she
had
imagined
her
to
be
a
small
person
when
here
stood
a
tall
very
beautiful
young
woman
her
hair
was
light
brown
and
perfectly
straight
she
had
peculiarly
passionate
fiery
eyes
of
very
dark
gray
of
the
smouldering
kind
as
nance
described
them
later
her
features
were
regular
and
her
mouth
so
expressive
of
her
humors
that
her
friends
could
almost
read
her
thoughts
by
the
curve
of
her
sensitive
lips
even
in
that
flashing
glimpse
the
girls
could
see
that
she
was
beautifully
dressed
in
a
white
serge
suit
and
a
stunning
hat
of
dull
blue
trimmed
with
wings
but
instead
of
continuing
her
mad
rush
which
seemed
to
be
her
usual
manner
of
doing
things
the
young
woman
became
suddenly
a
zephyr
of
mildness
and
gentleness
excuse
my
precipitate
methods
she
said
i
never
do
things
slowly
even
when
there
no
occasion
to
hurry
it
my
way
i
suppose
are
you
freshmen
perhaps
you
like
for
me
to
show
you
around
college
a
soph
i
fairly
familiar
nance
pressed
her
lips
together
she
was
not
in
the
habit
of
making
friends
molly
in
fact
was
almost
her
first
experience
in
this
kind
of
friendship
but
molly
brown
who
had
never
consciously
done
a
rude
thing
in
her
life
exclaimed
that
would
be
awfully
nice
thanks
we
come
they
followed
her
rather
timidly
down
the
steps
across
the
campus
the
pile
of
gray
buildings
in
the
september
twilight
more
than
ever
resembled
a
fine
old
castle
as
they
hastened
along
the
sophomore
gave
them
each
a
quick
comprehensive
glance
my
name
is
frances
andrews
she
began
suddenly
and
added
with
a
peculiar
intonation
i
was
called
last
year
i
so
glad
we
are
to
be
neighbors
i
hope
we
shall
have
lots
of
good
times
together
molly
considered
this
a
particular
mark
of
good
nature
on
the
part
of
an
older
girl
to
two
freshmen
and
she
promptly
made
known
their
names
to
frances
andrews
all
this
time
nance
had
remained
impassive
and
quiet
ten
girls
arm
in
arm
were
strolling
toward
them
across
the
soft
green
turf
of
the
campus
singing
as
in
one
voice
to
the
tune
of
maryland
my
maryland
oh
wellington
my
wellington
oh
how
i
love
my
wellington
suddenly
frances
andrews
who
was
walking
between
the
two
young
girls
took
them
each
firmly
by
the
arm
and
led
them
straight
across
the
campus
giving
the
ten
girls
a
wide
berth
there
was
so
much
fierce
determination
in
her
action
that
molly
and
nance
looked
at
her
with
amazement
are
those
seniors
asked
nance
thinking
perhaps
it
was
not
college
etiquette
to
break
through
a
line
of
established
and
dignified
characters
like
seniors
no
they
are
sophomores
singing
their
class
song
answered
frances
are
you
a
sophomore
demanded
nance
quickly
yes
curious
she
does
want
to
meet
her
friends
thought
molly
but
there
were
more
interesting
sights
to
occupy
her
attention
just
then
they
had
reached
the
great
gray
stone
archway
which
formed
the
entrance
to
the
quadrangle
a
grassy
courtyard
enclosed
on
all
sides
by
the
walls
of
the
building
heavy
oak
doors
of
an
antique
design
opened
straight
onto
the
court
from
the
various
corridors
and
lecture
rooms
and
at
one
end
was
the
library
a
beautiful
room
with
a
groined
roof
and
stained
glass
windows
like
a
chapel
low
stone
benches
were
ranged
along
the
arcade
of
the
court
whereon
sat
numerous
girls
laughing
and
talking
together
although
she
considered
that
undue
honors
were
being
paid
them
by
having
as
guide
this
dashing
sophomore
somehow
molly
still
felt
the
icy
grip
of
homesickness
on
her
heart
nance
seemed
so
unsympathetic
and
reserved
and
there
was
a
kind
of
hardness
about
this
frances
andrews
that
made
the
affectionate
molly
a
bit
uncomfortable
suddenly
nance
spied
her
old
friend
caroline
brinton
in
the
distance
and
rushed
over
to
join
her
as
she
left
three
girls
came
toward
them
talking
animatedly
hello
jennie
wren
called
frances
gayly
it
was
the
same
little
person
who
had
been
in
the
bus
howdy
rosamond
how
are
you
lotta
it
awfully
nice
to
be
back
at
the
old
stand
again
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
new
miss
brown
went
on
frances
hurriedly
as
if
to
fill
up
the
gaps
of
silence
which
greeted
them
how
do
you
do
miss
andrews
said
jennie
wren
stiffly
rosamond
chase
who
had
a
plump
figure
and
a
round
face
was
slightly
warmer
in
her
greeting
how
are
you
frankie
i
thought
you
were
going
to
france
this
winter
the
other
girl
who
had
a
nose
and
blonde
hair
and
was
called
peggy
parsons
sniffed
slightly
and
put
her
hands
behind
her
back
as
if
she
wished
to
avoid
shaking
hands
molly
was
so
shocked
that
she
felt
the
tears
rising
to
her
eyes
i
wish
i
had
never
come
to
college
she
thought
if
this
is
the
way
old
friends
treat
each
other
she
slipped
her
arm
through
frances
andrews
and
gave
it
a
sympathetic
squeeze
wo
you
show
me
the
cloisters
she
said
i
pining
to
see
what
they
are
like
come
along
said
frances
quite
cheerfully
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
had
just
been
snubbed
by
three
of
her
own
classmates
lifting
the
latch
of
a
small
oak
door
fitted
under
a
pointed
arch
she
led
the
way
through
a
passage
to
another
oak
door
which
opened
directly
on
the
cloisters
molly
gave
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
oh
she
cried
are
we
really
allowed
to
walk
in
this
wonderful
place
as
much
as
you
like
before
six
answered
frances
how
do
you
do
miss
pembroke
a
tall
woman
with
a
grave
handsome
face
was
waiting
under
the
arched
arcade
to
go
through
the
door
so
you
decided
to
come
back
to
us
miss
andrews
i
very
glad
of
it
come
into
my
office
a
moment
i
want
a
few
words
with
you
before
supper
you
can
find
your
way
back
to
queen
by
yourself
ca
you
miss
brown
asked
frances
i
see
you
later
and
in
another
moment
molly
brown
was
quite
alone
in
the
cloisters
she
was
glad
to
be
alone
she
wanted
to
think
she
paced
slowly
along
the
cloistered
walk
each
stone
arch
of
which
framed
a
picture
of
the
grassy
court
with
an
italian
fountain
in
the
center
it
exactly
like
an
old
monastery
she
said
to
herself
i
wonder
anybody
could
ever
be
frivolous
or
flippant
in
such
an
old
world
spot
as
this
i
could
easily
imagine
myself
a
monk
telling
my
beads
she
sat
down
on
a
stone
bench
and
folded
her
hands
meditatively
so
far
i
really
only
made
one
friend
at
college
she
thought
to
herself
for
nance
oldham
was
too
reserved
to
be
called
a
friend
yet
and
that
friend
is
frances
andrews
who
is
she
what
is
she
why
do
her
classmates
snub
her
and
why
did
miss
pembroke
who
belonged
to
the
faculty
wish
to
speak
with
her
in
her
private
office
it
was
all
queer
very
queer
somehow
it
seemed
to
molly
now
that
what
she
had
taken
for
whirlwind
manners
was
really
a
tremendous
excitement
under
which
frances
andrews
was
laboring
she
was
trying
to
brazen
out
something
just
the
same
i
sorry
for
her
she
said
out
loud
at
that
moment
a
musical
bell
boomed
out
six
times
in
the
stillness
of
the
cloisters
there
was
the
sound
of
a
door
opening
a
pause
and
the
door
closed
with
a
clicking
noise
molly
started
from
her
reverie
it
was
six
she
rushed
to
the
door
of
antique
design
through
which
she
had
entered
just
fifteen
minutes
before
it
was
closed
and
locked
securely
she
knocked
loudly
and
called
let
me
out
let
me
out
i
locked
in
then
she
waited
but
no
one
answered
in
the
stillness
of
the
twilit
courtyard
she
could
hear
the
sounds
of
laughter
and
talking
from
the
quadrangle
they
grew
fainter
and
fainter
a
gray
chill
settled
down
over
the
place
and
molly
looked
about
her
with
a
feeling
of
utter
desolation
she
had
been
locked
in
the
cloisters
for
the
night
chapter
iii
the
professor
molly
beat
and
kicked
on
the
door
wildly
then
she
called
again
and
again
but
her
voice
came
back
to
her
in
a
ghostly
echo
through
the
dim
aisles
of
the
cloistered
walk
she
sat
down
on
a
bench
and
burst
into
tears
how
tired
and
hungry
and
homesick
she
was
how
she
wished
she
had
never
heard
of
college
cold
unfriendly
place
where
people
insulted
old
friends
and
they
locked
doors
at
six
the
chill
of
the
evening
had
fallen
and
the
stars
were
beginning
to
show
themselves
in
the
square
of
blue
over
the
cloisters
molly
shivered
and
folded
her
arms
she
had
not
worn
her
coat
and
her
blue
linen
blouse
was
damp
with
dew
can
this
be
the
only
door
into
the
cloisters
she
thought
after
the
first
attack
of
homesick
weeping
had
passed
she
rose
and
began
to
search
along
the
arcade
which
was
now
almost
black
there
were
doors
at
intervals
but
all
of
them
locked
she
knocked
on
each
one
and
waited
patiently
oh
heavens
let
me
get
out
of
this
place
she
prayed
lifting
her
eyes
to
the
stars
with
an
agonized
expression
suddenly
the
high
mullioned
window
under
which
she
was
standing
glowed
with
a
light
just
struck
then
someone
opened
a
casement
and
a
man
voice
called
is
anyone
there
i
thought
i
heard
a
cry
i
am
said
molly
trying
to
stifle
the
sobs
that
would
rise
in
her
throat
i
been
locked
in
or
rather
out
why
you
poor
child
exclaimed
the
voice
again
wait
a
moment
and
i
open
the
door
there
were
sounds
of
steps
along
the
passage
a
heavy
bolt
was
thrust
back
and
a
door
held
open
while
molly
rushed
into
the
passage
like
a
frightened
bird
out
of
the
dark
it
lucky
i
happened
to
be
in
my
study
this
evening
said
the
man
leading
the
way
toward
a
square
of
light
in
the
dark
corridor
of
course
the
night
watchman
would
have
made
his
rounds
at
eight
but
an
hour
suspense
out
there
in
the
cold
and
dark
would
have
been
very
disagreeable
how
in
the
world
did
it
happen
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
study
and
molly
found
herself
in
a
cozy
little
room
lined
from
ceiling
to
floor
with
books
on
the
desk
was
a
tray
of
supper
the
owner
of
the
study
was
a
studious
looking
young
man
with
kindly
quizzical
brown
eyes
under
shaggy
eyebrows
a
firm
mouth
and
a
cleft
in
his
chin
which
molly
had
always
heard
was
a
mark
of
beauty
in
a
woman
you
must
be
a
freshman
he
said
looking
at
her
with
a
shade
of
amusement
in
his
eyes
i
am
replied
molly
bravely
trying
to
keep
her
voice
from
shaking
i
only
arrived
an
hour
or
so
ago
i
i
did
know
they
would
lock
she
broke
down
altogether
and
slipping
into
a
big
wicker
chair
sobbed
bitterly
oh
i
wish
i
wish
i
stayed
at
home
why
you
poor
little
girl
exclaimed
the
man
you
have
had
a
beastly
time
for
your
first
day
at
college
but
you
come
to
like
it
better
and
better
all
the
time
come
dry
your
eyes
and
i
start
you
on
your
way
to
your
lodgings
where
are
you
stopping
queen
suppose
you
drink
some
hot
soup
before
you
go
it
will
warm
you
up
he
added
kindly
taking
a
cup
of
hot
bouillon
from
the
tray
and
placing
it
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
but
it
your
supper
stammered
molly
nonsense
there
plenty
more
do
as
i
tell
you
he
ordered
i
a
professor
you
know
so
you
have
to
obey
me
or
i
scold
molly
drank
the
soup
without
a
word
it
did
comfort
her
considerably
and
presently
she
looked
up
at
the
professor
and
said
i
all
right
now
i
hope
you
excuse
me
for
being
so
silly
and
weak
you
see
i
felt
so
far
away
and
lonesome
and
it
an
awful
feeling
to
be
locked
out
in
the
cold
about
a
thousand
miles
from
home
i
never
was
before
i
sure
i
should
have
felt
the
same
in
your
place
answered
the
professor
i
should
probably
have
imagined
i
saw
the
ghosts
of
monks
dead
and
gone
who
might
have
walked
there
if
the
cloisters
had
been
several
hundreds
of
years
older
and
i
would
certainly
have
made
the
echoes
ring
with
my
calls
for
help
the
cloisters
are
all
right
for
and
which
i
believe
is
what
they
are
intended
to
be
used
for
on
a
warm
sunny
day
but
they
are
cold
comfort
after
sunset
is
this
your
study
asked
molly
rising
and
looking
about
her
with
interest
as
she
started
toward
the
door
i
should
say
that
this
was
my
play
room
he
replied
smiling
play
room
yes
this
is
where
i
hide
from
work
and
begin
to
play
he
glanced
at
a
pile
of
manuscript
on
his
desk
i
reckon
work
is
play
and
play
is
work
to
you
observed
molly
regarding
the
papers
with
much
interest
she
had
never
before
seen
a
manuscript
if
you
knew
what
an
heretical
document
that
was
you
would
not
make
such
rash
statements
said
the
professor
i
sure
it
a
learned
treatise
on
some
scientific
subject
laughed
molly
who
had
entirely
regained
her
composure
now
and
felt
not
the
least
bit
afraid
of
this
learned
man
with
the
kind
brown
eyes
he
seemed
quite
old
to
her
if
i
tell
you
what
it
is
will
you
promise
to
keep
it
a
secret
i
promise
she
cried
eagerly
it
the
libretto
of
a
light
opera
he
said
solemnly
enjoying
her
amazement
did
you
write
it
she
asked
breathlessly
not
the
music
but
the
words
and
the
lyrics
now
i
told
you
my
only
secret
he
said
you
must
never
give
me
away
or
the
bottom
would
fall
out
of
the
chair
of
english
literature
at
wellington
college
i
shall
never
never
tell
exclaimed
molly
and
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
your
kindness
they
clasped
hands
and
the
professor
opened
the
door
for
her
and
stood
back
to
let
her
pass
then
he
followed
her
down
the
passage
to
another
door
which
he
also
opened
and
in
the
dim
light
she
still
noticed
that
quizzical
look
in
his
eyes
which
made
her
wonder
whether
he
was
laughing
at
her
in
particular
or
at
things
in
general
can
you
find
your
way
to
queen
cottage
he
asked
oh
yes
she
assured
him
it
the
last
house
on
the
left
of
the
campus
the
next
moment
she
found
herself
running
along
the
deserted
quadrangle
walk
under
the
archway
she
flew
and
straight
across
the
campus
home
it
was
not
yet
seven
and
the
queen
cottage
girls
were
still
at
supper
a
number
of
students
had
arrived
during
the
afternoon
and
the
table
was
full
there
were
several
freshmen
molly
identified
them
by
their
silence
and
looks
of
unaccustomedness
and
some
older
girls
who
were
chattering
together
like
magpies
where
have
you
been
demanded
nance
oldham
who
had
saved
a
seat
for
her
roommate
next
to
her
own
all
conversation
ceased
and
every
eye
in
the
room
was
turned
on
blushing
molly
i
i
been
locked
up
she
answered
faintly
locked
up
repeated
several
voices
at
once
where
in
the
cloisters
i
did
realize
it
was
six
and
some
one
locked
the
door
molly
had
been
prepared
for
a
good
deal
of
amusement
at
her
expense
and
she
felt
very
grateful
when
instead
of
hoots
of
derision
a
nice
junior
named
sallie
marks
with
an
interesting
face
and
good
dark
eyes
exclaimed
why
you
poor
little
freshie
what
a
medi√¶val
adventure
for
your
first
day
and
how
did
you
finally
get
out
one
of
the
professors
heard
me
call
and
let
me
out
which
one
demanded
several
voices
at
once
i
do
know
his
name
replied
molly
guardedly
remembering
that
she
had
a
secret
to
keep
what
did
he
look
like
demanded
frances
andrews
who
had
been
unusually
silent
for
her
until
now
he
had
brown
eyes
and
a
smooth
face
and
reddish
hair
and
he
was
middle
aged
and
quite
nice
said
molly
glibly
what
you
do
mean
to
say
it
was
epim√©nides
antinous
green
who
demanded
molly
never
mind
do
let
them
guy
you
said
sallie
marks
it
was
evidently
professor
edwin
green
who
let
you
in
he
is
professor
of
english
literature
and
i
tell
you
for
your
enlightenment
that
he
was
nicknamed
in
a
song
after
a
greek
philosopher
who
went
to
sleep
when
he
was
a
boy
and
woke
up
and
very
wise
and
after
a
very
handsome
greek
youth
do
you
think
him
rather
for
an
older
person
said
molly
thoughtfully
he
not
thirty
yet
my
child
said
frances
andrews
at
least
so
they
say
and
he
so
clever
that
two
other
colleges
are
after
him
and
he
written
two
books
went
on
sally
have
you
heard
of
them
essays
and
poetry
molly
was
obliged
to
confess
her
ignorance
regarding
professor
edwin
green
outbursts
into
literature
but
she
indulged
in
an
inward
mental
smile
remembering
the
lyrics
in
the
comic
opera
libretto
he
been
to
harvard
and
oxford
and
studied
in
france
he
a
perfect
infant
prodigy
went
on
another
girl
it
a
ripping
thing
for
the
molly
heard
another
girl
whisper
to
her
neighbor
she
knew
she
would
be
the
subject
of
an
everlasting
joke
but
she
hoped
to
live
it
down
by
learning
immediately
everything
there
was
to
know
about
wellington
and
becoming
so
wise
that
nobody
would
ever
accuse
her
again
of
being
a
green
freshman
maynard
the
matron
came
in
to
see
if
she
was
all
right
she
was
a
motherly
little
woman
with
a
gentle
manner
and
molly
felt
a
leaning
toward
her
at
once
i
hope
you
feel
comfortable
in
your
new
quarters
said
maynard
you
have
plenty
of
sunshine
and
a
good
deal
more
space
when
you
get
your
trunks
unpacked
although
the
things
inside
a
trunk
do
sometimes
look
bigger
than
the
trunk
molly
smiled
there
was
not
much
in
her
trunk
to
take
up
space
most
certainly
she
had
nicknamed
herself
when
she
packed
it
molly
few
clothes
and
she
was
beginning
to
wonder
if
even
those
few
would
pass
muster
in
that
crowd
of
girls
oh
have
the
trunks
really
come
miss
oldham
she
asked
her
roommate
yes
just
before
supper
i
started
unpacking
mine
thank
goodness
i
got
an
old
ham
and
a
hickory
nut
cake
and
some
beaten
biscuits
and
pickles
and
blackberry
jam
in
mine
and
i
can
hardly
wait
to
see
if
anything
has
broken
loose
on
my
clothes
such
as
they
are
nance
oldham
opened
her
eyes
wide
i
always
heard
that
southern
people
were
pretty
strong
on
food
she
said
and
this
proves
it
wait
until
you
try
the
hickory
nut
cake
and
you
wo
be
so
scornful
answered
molly
somehow
not
liking
this
accusation
regarding
the
appetites
of
her
people
did
i
hear
the
words
nut
cake
spoken
demanded
frances
andrews
who
apparently
talked
to
no
one
at
the
table
except
freshmen
yes
i
brought
some
come
up
and
try
it
said
molly
hospitably
that
would
be
very
jolly
but
i
ca
thanks
said
frances
flushing
and
then
molly
and
nance
noticed
that
the
other
sophomores
and
juniors
at
the
table
were
all
perfectly
silent
and
looking
at
her
curiously
i
hope
you
all
come
she
added
lamely
wondering
if
they
were
accusing
her
of
inhospitality
not
my
child
said
sally
marks
rising
from
the
table
thank
you
very
much
as
the
two
freshmen
climbed
the
stairs
to
their
room
a
little
later
they
passed
by
an
open
door
on
the
landing
come
in
called
the
voice
of
sally
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
pass
this
is
my
home
how
do
you
like
it
very
much
answered
the
two
girls
really
not
seeing
anything
particularly
remarkable
about
the
apartment
except
perhaps
the
sign
on
the
door
which
read
pax
vobiscum
and
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
owner
of
the
room
had
a
christian
spirit
your
name
is
brown
and
you
come
from
kentucky
is
that
so
asked
sally
marks
taking
molly
chin
in
her
hand
and
looking
into
her
eyes
and
yours
went
on
the
inquisitive
sally
turning
to
molly
roommate
is
nance
oldham
and
i
come
from
vermont
finished
nance
promptly
you
both
dears
and
i
am
ever
so
glad
you
are
in
queens
you
think
i
patronizing
if
i
give
you
a
little
advice
will
you
oh
no
said
the
two
girls
you
know
wellington
full
of
nice
girls
i
do
think
there
is
a
small
college
in
this
country
that
has
such
a
fine
showing
for
class
and
brains
but
among
three
hundred
there
are
bound
to
be
some
black
sheep
and
new
girls
should
always
be
careful
with
whom
they
take
up
but
how
can
we
tell
asked
nance
oh
there
are
ways
suppose
for
instance
you
should
meet
a
girl
who
was
clever
rich
with
lots
of
pretty
clothes
and
all
that
and
she
seemed
to
have
no
friends
what
would
you
think
why
i
might
think
there
was
something
the
matter
with
her
unless
she
was
too
shy
to
make
friends
but
suppose
she
was
persisted
sally
then
there
would
surely
be
something
the
matter
said
nance
well
then
children
if
you
should
meet
a
girl
like
that
in
college
do
get
too
intimate
with
her
sally
marks
led
them
up
to
their
own
room
just
to
see
how
they
were
fixed
she
said
later
when
the
two
girls
had
crawled
wearily
into
bed
after
finishing
the
unpacking
molly
called
out
sleepily
nance
she
had
forgotten
already
to
say
miss
oldham
do
you
suppose
that
nice
junior
could
have
meant
miss
andrews
i
have
a
doubt
of
it
said
nance
just
the
same
i
sorry
for
the
poor
thing
continued
molly
sorry
for
anybody
who
walking
under
a
cloud
and
i
do
think
it
would
do
any
harm
to
be
nice
to
her
it
would
do
her
any
harm
said
nance
epim√©nides
antinous
green
whispered
molly
to
herself
as
she
snuggled
under
the
covers
the
name
seemed
to
stick
in
her
memory
like
a
rhyme
funny
i
did
notice
how
young
and
handsome
he
was
i
only
noticed
that
he
had
good
manners
if
he
did
treat
me
like
a
child
chapter
iv
a
busy
day
the
next
day
was
always
a
chaotic
one
in
molly
memory
a
jumble
of
new
faces
and
strange
events
at
breakfast
she
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
freshmen
who
were
staying
at
queen
cottage
four
in
all
one
of
these
was
julia
kean
a
nice
girl
in
neutral
tints
as
molly
wrote
home
to
her
sister
with
gray
eyes
and
brown
hair
and
a
sense
of
humor
she
came
to
be
known
as
judy
and
formed
an
intimate
friendship
with
molly
and
nance
which
lasted
throughout
the
four
years
of
their
college
course
how
do
you
feel
after
your
night
rest
she
called
across
the
table
to
molly
in
the
most
friendly
manner
just
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
always
you
look
like
the
of
the
sea
in
that
blue
linen
that
just
matches
your
eyes
she
began
looking
molly
over
with
a
kind
of
critical
admiration
narrowing
her
eyes
as
an
artist
does
when
he
at
work
on
a
picture
i
like
to
make
a
poster
of
you
in
chalk
i
put
you
on
a
yellow
sandy
beach
against
a
bright
blue
sky
in
a
high
wind
with
your
dress
and
hair
blowing
and
with
eyes
still
narrowed
she
traced
an
imaginary
picture
with
one
hand
and
shaped
her
ideas
with
the
other
molly
laughed
you
must
be
an
artist
she
said
with
such
notions
about
posing
a
one
that
all
yet
but
soon
is
my
motto
that
a
bad
motto
here
put
in
nance
oldham
it
like
the
spanish
saying
of
you
are
very
apt
to
put
off
doing
things
until
next
day
julia
kean
looked
at
her
reproachfully
you
read
my
character
in
two
words
she
said
why
do
you
introduce
me
to
your
friends
judy
asked
a
handsome
girl
next
to
her
who
had
quantities
of
hair
piled
on
top
of
her
head
i
have
been
introduced
myself
replied
judy
but
i
never
could
see
why
people
should
stop
for
introductions
at
teas
and
times
like
this
we
all
know
we
all
right
or
else
we
would
be
here
of
course
said
frances
andrews
who
had
just
come
in
why
all
this
formality
when
we
are
to
be
a
family
party
for
the
next
eight
months
why
not
become
friends
at
once
without
any
preliminaries
sally
marks
who
had
given
them
the
vague
yet
meaningful
warning
the
night
before
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
her
coffee
cup
and
the
other
two
sophomores
at
the
table
were
engaged
in
a
whispered
conversation
nevertheless
i
will
perform
the
introductions
announced
judy
kean
this
is
miss
margaret
wakefield
of
washington
miss
edith
coles
of
rhode
island
miss
jessie
lynch
of
wisconsin
and
miss
mabel
hinton
of
illinois
as
for
me
my
name
is
julia
kean
and
i
come
from
nowhere
in
particular
you
must
have
had
a
birthplace
insisted
that
accurate
young
person
nance
oldham
if
you
could
call
a
ship
a
birthplace
i
did
replied
judy
i
was
born
in
on
a
stormy
night
hence
my
stormy
restless
nature
but
how
did
it
happen
asked
molly
oh
it
was
all
simple
enough
papa
and
mamma
were
on
their
way
back
from
japan
and
i
arrived
a
bit
prematurely
on
board
ship
i
began
life
traveling
and
i
been
traveling
ever
since
you
have
to
stay
put
here
awhile
at
least
said
sally
marks
i
hope
so
i
need
to
gather
a
little
moss
before
i
become
an
habitual
tramp
had
we
better
be
chasing
along
said
frances
andrews
it
almost
time
for
chapel
no
one
answered
and
molly
began
to
wonder
how
long
this
strange
girl
would
endure
the
part
of
a
monologist
at
college
for
that
was
what
her
attempts
at
conversation
seemed
to
amount
to
she
admired
pluck
at
any
rate
whatever
she
had
done
to
offend
it
was
courageous
of
her
to
come
back
and
face
the
music
chapel
was
an
impressive
sight
to
the
new
girls
the
entire
body
of
students
was
there
and
the
faculty
including
professor
edwin
green
who
gave
each
girl
the
impression
he
was
looking
at
her
when
he
was
really
only
gazing
into
the
imaginary
of
an
imaginary
camera
and
saw
not
one
of
them
molly
decided
his
comeliness
was
more
charm
than
looks
the
unknown
charm
she
wrote
her
sister
his
ears
are
a
little
pointed
at
the
top
and
he
has
brown
eyes
like
a
collie
dog
but
it
was
nice
of
him
to
have
given
me
his
soup
she
added
irrelevantly
and
i
shall
always
appreciate
it
after
chapel
when
molly
was
following
in
the
trail
of
her
new
friends
feeling
a
bit
strange
and
unaccustomed
some
one
plucked
her
by
the
sleeve
it
was
mary
stewart
the
nice
senior
with
the
plain
but
fine
face
i
expect
you
this
evening
after
supper
she
said
i
having
a
little
party
there
will
be
music
too
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
like
to
bring
a
friend
along
it
rather
lonesome
breaking
into
a
new
crowd
by
one
self
it
never
occurred
to
molly
that
she
was
being
paid
undue
honors
for
a
freshman
who
had
arrived
only
the
afternoon
before
without
a
friend
in
college
to
be
asked
to
a
small
intimate
party
by
the
most
prominent
girl
in
the
senior
class
was
really
quite
remarkable
so
nance
oldham
thought
and
she
was
pleased
to
be
the
one
molly
chose
to
take
along
the
two
girls
had
had
a
busy
exciting
day
they
had
not
been
placed
in
the
same
divisions
b
and
o
being
so
widely
separated
in
the
alphabet
and
were
now
meeting
again
for
the
first
time
since
lunch
molly
had
stretched
her
length
on
her
couch
and
kicked
off
her
pumps
described
later
by
judy
kean
as
being
a
yard
long
and
an
inch
broad
illustration
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
your
receipt
for
making
friends
molly
exclaimed
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
your
receipt
for
making
friends
molly
exclaimed
nance
you
are
really
a
perfect
wonder
do
you
find
it
troublesome
to
be
so
nice
to
so
many
people
i
find
it
lots
harder
not
to
be
nice
answered
molly
besides
a
rule
that
works
both
ways
the
nicer
you
are
to
people
the
nicer
they
are
to
you
but
do
you
think
lots
of
people
are
worth
the
effort
and
if
you
treat
them
like
sisters
they
are
apt
to
take
advantage
of
it
and
bore
you
afterwards
molly
smiled
i
never
been
troubled
that
way
she
said
now
do
tell
me
cried
nance
warming
to
the
argument
that
that
universally
cordial
manner
of
yours
does
bring
a
lot
of
around
to
monopolize
you
if
it
has
before
it
will
now
you
see
you
make
me
feel
like
the
leader
of
coxey
army
laughed
molly
because
you
see
i
a
kind
of
a
myself
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
was
thinking
of
her
meagre
wardrobe
nance
was
silent
she
was
slow
of
speech
but
when
she
once
began
she
always
said
more
than
she
intended
simply
to
prove
her
point
and
now
she
was
afraid
she
had
hurt
molly
feelings
she
was
provoked
with
herself
for
her
carelessness
and
when
she
was
on
bad
terms
with
herself
she
appeared
to
be
on
bad
terms
with
everybody
else
of
course
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
had
been
thinking
of
frances
andrews
whom
she
felt
certain
molly
would
never
snub
sufficiently
to
keep
her
at
a
distance
the
two
girls
went
about
their
dressing
without
saying
another
word
nance
was
coiling
her
smooth
brown
braids
around
her
head
while
molly
was
looking
sorrowfully
at
her
only
two
available
dresses
for
that
evening
party
one
was
a
blue
muslin
of
a
heavenly
color
but
considerably
darned
and
the
other
was
a
marquisette
also
the
worse
for
wear
suddenly
nance
gave
a
reckless
toss
of
her
hair
brush
in
one
direction
and
her
comb
in
another
and
rushed
over
to
molly
who
was
gazing
absently
into
the
closet
oh
molly
she
cried
impetuously
seizing
her
friend
hand
i
a
brute
will
you
forgive
me
i
afraid
i
hurt
your
feelings
it
just
my
unfortunate
way
of
getting
excited
and
saying
too
much
i
never
met
any
one
i
admired
as
much
as
you
in
such
a
short
time
i
wish
i
did
know
how
to
be
charming
to
everybody
like
you
it
been
ground
into
me
since
i
was
a
child
not
to
make
friends
with
people
unless
it
was
to
my
advantage
and
i
found
out
they
were
entirely
worthy
and
it
a
slow
process
i
can
tell
you
you
are
the
very
first
chance
acquaintance
i
ever
made
in
my
life
and
i
like
you
better
than
any
girl
i
ever
met
so
there
will
you
say
you
have
forgiven
me
of
course
i
will
exclaimed
molly
flushing
with
pleasure
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
i
know
i
too
indiscriminate
about
making
friends
mother
often
complained
because
i
would
bring
such
queer
children
out
to
dinner
when
i
was
a
child
indeed
i
was
hurt
a
bit
it
was
the
word
that
seemed
to
be
such
an
excellent
description
of
the
clothes
i
must
wear
this
winter
unless
some
should
drop
down
from
heaven
like
manna
in
the
desert
for
the
children
of
israel
without
a
word
nance
pulled
a
box
out
from
under
her
couch
and
lifted
the
lid
it
disclosed
a
little
hand
sewing
machine
can
you
sew
she
asked
after
a
fashion
well
i
can
it
pastime
with
me
i
rather
make
clothes
than
do
lots
of
other
things
now
suppose
we
set
to
work
and
make
some
dresses
how
would
you
like
a
blue
serge
with
collar
and
cuffs
like
that
one
miss
marks
is
wearing
that
fastens
down
the
side
with
black
satin
buttons
oh
nance
i
could
let
you
do
all
that
for
me
protested
molly
besides
i
have
the
material
or
anything
why
do
you
earn
some
money
molly
suggested
nance
there
are
lots
of
different
ways
murphy
the
housekeeper
was
telling
me
about
them
one
of
the
girls
here
last
year
actually
blacked
boots
but
of
course
you
would
do
anything
so
menial
as
that
would
i
interrupted
molly
just
watch
me
that
a
splendid
idea
nance
it
a
fine
honorable
labor
as
colonel
robert
wakefield
said
when
his
wife
had
to
take
in
boarders
molly
slipped
on
the
blue
muslin
it
really
does
make
any
difference
what
she
wears
thought
nance
looking
at
her
friend
with
covert
admiration
she
be
a
star
in
a
crazy
quilt
the
two
girls
hurried
down
to
supper
molly
was
thoughtful
all
through
that
conversational
meal
her
mind
was
busy
with
a
scheme
by
which
she
intended
to
remove
that
unceasing
pressure
for
funds
which
bade
fair
to
be
an
bugbear
to
her
no
on
the
quadrangle
turned
out
to
be
a
very
luxurious
and
comfortable
suite
of
rooms
consisting
of
quite
a
large
parlor
a
little
den
or
study
and
a
bedroom
mary
stewart
met
them
at
the
door
in
such
a
plain
dress
that
at
first
molly
was
deceived
into
thinking
it
was
just
an
ordinary
frock
until
she
noticed
the
lines
and
in
a
few
moments
nance
took
occasion
to
inform
her
that
simplicity
was
one
of
the
most
expensive
things
in
the
world
which
few
people
could
afford
and
furthermore
that
mary
stewart
gray
dress
was
a
dream
of
beauty
and
must
have
come
from
paris
there
were
six
or
seven
other
girls
in
the
crowd
including
that
little
creature
they
called
jennie
wren
whose
real
name
was
jane
wickham
the
only
other
girl
they
knew
was
judith
blount
who
had
been
so
snubby
to
molly
the
day
before
about
the
luggage
all
these
girls
were
musical
as
the
freshmen
were
soon
to
learn
and
belonged
to
the
college
glee
club
what
a
pretty
room
exclaimed
molly
to
her
hostess
after
she
had
been
properly
introduced
and
enthroned
in
a
big
tapestry
chair
in
which
she
unconsciously
made
a
most
delightful
and
colorful
picture
i
glad
you
like
it
i
have
some
trouble
keeping
it
from
getting
cluttered
up
with
as
we
call
it
it
about
like
hercules
trying
to
clean
the
augean
stables
i
think
but
i
try
and
use
the
den
for
an
overflow
and
only
put
the
things
i
really
fond
of
in
here
that
helps
some
they
are
certainly
lovely
said
the
young
freshman
looking
wistfully
at
the
head
of
the
unknown
woman
between
two
brass
candlesticks
on
the
mantel
shelf
on
the
bookshelves
stood
the
winged
victory
and
hanging
over
the
shelves
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
was
an
immense
photograph
of
botticelli
primavera
the
only
other
pictures
were
two
japanese
prints
and
the
only
other
furniture
was
a
baby
grand
piano
and
some
chairs
it
was
really
a
delightfully
empty
and
beautiful
place
and
molly
felt
suddenly
strangely
crude
and
ignorant
when
she
recalled
the
things
she
had
intended
to
do
to
her
part
of
the
room
at
queen
cottage
toward
beautifying
it
she
was
engaged
in
mentally
clearing
them
all
out
when
a
voice
at
her
elbow
said
are
you
thinking
of
taking
the
vows
miss
brown
it
was
judith
blount
who
had
drawn
up
a
chair
beside
her
there
was
something
very
patronizing
and
superior
in
miss
blount
manner
but
molly
was
determined
to
ignore
it
and
smiled
sweetly
into
the
black
eyes
of
the
haughty
sophomore
taking
what
vows
she
asked
why
i
understood
you
had
become
a
cloistered
nun
molly
flushed
so
the
story
was
out
it
did
take
long
for
news
to
travel
through
a
girl
college
i
was
cloistered
very
long
she
answered
and
the
only
vow
i
took
was
never
to
be
caught
there
again
after
six
how
did
you
like
epim√©nides
i
hear
he
made
a
great
joke
of
it
she
continued
without
waiting
for
molly
to
answer
he
rather
humorous
you
know
even
in
his
most
serious
work
it
will
come
out
i
do
think
there
was
much
to
joke
about
put
in
molly
feeling
a
little
indignant
i
was
awfully
forlorn
and
miserable
the
real
joke
was
that
he
called
you
miss
smith
said
judith
molly
moods
reflected
themselves
in
her
eyes
just
as
the
passing
clouds
are
mirrored
in
two
blue
pools
of
water
a
shadow
passed
over
her
face
now
and
her
eyes
grew
darker
but
she
kept
very
quiet
which
was
her
way
when
her
feelings
were
hurt
then
mary
stewart
began
to
play
on
the
piano
and
molly
forgot
all
about
the
sophomore
who
she
strongly
suspected
was
trying
to
be
disagreeable
but
for
what
reason
for
the
life
of
her
molly
could
not
see
never
before
had
she
heard
any
really
good
playing
on
the
piano
and
it
seemed
to
her
now
that
the
music
actually
flowed
from
mary
long
strong
fingers
in
a
melodious
and
liquid
stream
other
music
followed
judith
sang
a
gypsy
song
in
a
rich
contralto
voice
that
molly
thought
was
a
little
coarse
jennie
wren
who
could
sing
exactly
like
a
child
gave
a
solo
in
the
highest
little
piping
soprano
two
girls
played
on
mandolins
and
mary
stewart
who
appeared
to
do
most
things
accompanied
them
on
a
guitar
then
came
supper
which
was
rather
plain
molly
thought
and
consisted
simply
of
tea
and
cookies
i
suppose
artistic
not
to
have
much
to
eat
her
thoughts
continued
but
she
made
up
her
mind
to
invite
mary
stewart
to
supper
before
the
old
ham
and
the
hickory
nut
cake
were
consumed
by
hungry
freshmen
it
seems
to
me
that
with
such
a
voice
as
yours
you
must
sing
miss
brown
here
broke
in
mary
stewart
will
you
please
oblige
the
company
i
would
like
to
sing
after
all
this
fine
music
protested
molly
besides
i
do
know
anything
but
darky
songs
the
very
girl
we
want
for
our
vaudeville
cried
jennie
wren
what
do
you
use
a
guitar
or
a
piano
either
a
little
answered
molly
blushing
crimson
but
i
have
any
more
voice
than
a
rabbit
fire
away
cried
jennie
wren
thrusting
a
guitar
into
her
hands
molly
was
actually
trembling
with
fright
when
she
found
herself
the
center
of
interest
in
this
musical
company
illustration
i
scared
to
death
she
announced
then
she
struck
a
chord
and
i
scared
to
death
she
announced
as
she
faintly
tuned
the
guitar
then
she
struck
a
chord
and
began
ma
baby
loves
shortnin
ma
baby
loves
shortnin
bread
ma
baby
loves
shortnin
mammy
gwine
make
him
some
shortnin
bread
before
she
had
finished
everybody
in
the
room
had
joined
in
then
she
sang
ole
uncle
rat
has
come
to
town
to
buy
his
niece
a
weddin
gown
a
quarter
to
ten
announced
some
one
and
the
next
moment
they
had
all
said
and
were
running
as
fast
as
their
feet
could
carry
them
across
the
campus
scuttling
in
every
direction
like
a
lot
of
rats
as
judith
remarked
lights
out
at
ten
whispered
nance
breathlessly
as
they
crept
into
their
room
and
undressed
in
the
dark
it
was
very
exciting
they
felt
like
a
pair
of
happy
criminals
who
had
just
escaped
the
iron
grasp
of
the
law
when
molly
brown
dropped
into
a
deep
and
restful
sleep
that
night
she
never
dreamed
that
she
had
already
become
a
noted
person
in
college
though
how
it
happened
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
it
might
have
been
the
cloister
story
but
nevertheless
molly
overgrown
child
that
she
may
have
seemed
to
professor
green
had
a
personality
that
attracted
attention
wherever
she
was
chapter
the
kentucky
spread
molly
you
look
a
little
worried
observed
nance
oldham
two
days
before
the
famous
spread
was
to
take
place
it
having
been
set
for
friday
evening
molly
was
seated
on
her
bed
in
the
midst
of
a
conglomerate
mass
of
books
and
clothes
chewing
the
end
of
a
pencil
while
she
knitted
her
brows
over
a
list
of
names
not
exactly
worried
she
replied
but
you
know
nance
giving
a
party
is
exactly
like
some
kind
of
strong
stimulant
with
me
it
goes
to
my
head
and
i
seem
to
get
intoxicated
on
invitations
once
i
get
started
to
inviting
i
ca
seem
to
stop
molly
brown
put
in
nance
severely
i
believe
you
just
about
invited
the
whole
of
wellington
college
to
come
here
friday
night
and
because
you
are
already
such
a
famous
person
everybody
has
accepted
i
think
i
can
about
remember
how
many
i
asked
she
replied
penitently
there
are
all
the
girls
in
the
house
of
course
frances
andrews
molly
nodded
and
all
the
girls
who
were
at
miss
stewart
the
other
night
what
even
that
girl
who
makes
catty
speeches
that
blount
person
yes
even
so
continued
molly
sadly
i
really
had
intended
to
ask
her
nance
but
i
do
love
to
heap
coals
of
fire
on
people
heads
and
besides
i
just
told
you
when
i
get
started
i
ca
seem
to
stop
when
i
was
younger
i
been
known
to
bring
home
as
many
as
six
strange
little
girls
to
dinner
at
once
the
next
time
you
give
a
party
put
in
nance
we
better
make
out
the
list
beforehand
and
then
you
must
give
me
your
word
of
honor
not
to
add
one
name
to
it
i
try
to
replied
molly
with
contrition
but
it
awfully
hard
to
take
the
pledge
when
it
comes
to
asking
people
to
meals
even
spreads
the
two
girls
examined
the
list
together
and
molly
racked
her
brains
to
try
and
remember
any
as
she
called
them
i
certain
that
all
she
said
at
last
that
makes
twenty
it
oh
nance
i
tremble
for
the
old
ham
and
the
hickory
nut
cake
do
you
think
they
go
round
aunty
she
my
godmother
is
sending
me
another
box
of
beaten
biscuits
she
has
promised
to
keep
me
supplied
you
know
i
have
never
eaten
cold
light
bread
in
my
life
at
breakfast
and
i
just
as
soon
choke
down
cold
potatoes
as
the
soggy
bread
they
give
us
here
but
beaten
biscuit
and
ham
and
pickles
wo
be
enough
even
with
hickory
nut
cake
she
continued
doubtfully
i
have
a
chafing
dish
we
can
make
fudge
then
there
tea
you
know
we
can
borrow
cups
and
saucers
from
the
others
but
we
have
to
do
something
else
for
their
amusement
besides
feed
them
have
you
thought
of
anything
lillie
and
millie
these
were
two
sophomores
at
queen
have
a
stunt
they
have
promised
to
give
it
to
be
a
surprise
and
jennie
wren
has
promised
to
bring
her
guitar
and
oblige
us
with
a
few
selections
but
oh
nance
except
for
the
eatin
i
afraid
it
wo
be
near
such
a
fine
party
as
mary
stewart
was
eatin
the
main
thing
child
do
let
that
worry
you
replied
nance
consolingly
i
think
i
have
an
idea
of
something
which
would
interest
the
company
but
i
not
going
to
tell
even
you
what
it
is
nance
had
a
provoking
way
of
keeping
choice
secrets
and
then
springing
them
when
she
was
entirely
ready
and
wild
horses
could
not
drag
them
out
of
her
before
that
propitious
moment
on
friday
evening
the
girls
began
to
arrive
early
for
as
has
been
said
molly
was
already
an
object
of
interest
at
wellington
college
and
the
fame
of
her
beaten
biscuits
and
old
ham
had
spread
abroad
some
of
the
guests
like
mary
stewart
came
because
they
were
greatly
attracted
toward
the
young
freshman
and
others
like
judith
blount
felt
only
an
amused
curiosity
in
accepting
the
invitation
as
a
general
thing
judith
was
a
very
exclusive
person
but
she
felt
she
could
safely
show
her
face
where
mary
stewart
was
this
looks
pretty
fine
to
me
observed
that
nice
unaffected
young
woman
herself
shaking
hands
with
molly
and
nance
it
good
of
you
to
say
so
replied
molly
your
premises
would
make
two
of
our
i
thinking
but
look
at
your
grand
buffet
how
clever
of
you
one
of
you
two
children
must
have
a
genius
for
arrangement
the
study
tables
had
been
placed
at
one
end
of
the
room
close
together
their
crudities
covered
with
a
white
cloth
borrowed
from
murphy
and
on
these
were
piled
the
viands
in
a
manner
to
give
the
illusion
of
great
profusion
and
plenty
it
molly
laughed
nance
she
a
natural
entertainer
not
at
all
put
in
molly
i
come
of
a
family
of
cooks
and
did
your
cook
relatives
marry
butlers
asked
judith
molly
stifled
a
laugh
somehow
judith
could
say
things
like
other
girls
there
was
always
a
tinge
of
spite
in
her
speeches
where
i
come
from
she
said
gravely
the
cooks
and
butlers
are
colored
people
and
the
old
ones
are
almost
like
relatives
they
are
so
loyal
and
devoted
but
there
are
not
many
of
those
left
now
the
room
was
gradually
filling
and
presently
every
guest
had
arrived
except
frances
andrews
we
wo
wait
for
her
said
molly
to
lillie
and
millie
the
two
inseparable
sophomores
who
now
quietly
slipped
out
presently
nance
major
domo
for
the
evening
shoved
all
the
guests
back
onto
the
divans
and
into
the
corners
until
a
circle
was
formed
in
the
centre
of
the
room
she
then
hung
a
placard
on
the
knob
of
the
door
which
read
mahomet
the
cock
of
the
east
chantecler
the
cock
of
the
west
there
was
a
sound
of
giggling
and
scuffling
the
door
opened
and
two
enormous
cocks
entered
the
room
both
fowls
had
white
bodies
made
by
putting
the
feet
through
the
sleeves
of
a
nightgown
which
was
drawn
up
around
the
neck
and
over
the
arms
the
fullness
gathered
into
the
back
and
tied
into
a
rakish
tail
a
persian
kimono
was
draped
over
mahomet
to
represent
wings
and
a
tightly
fitting
white
cap
with
a
point
over
the
forehead
covered
his
head
his
face
was
powdered
to
a
ghastly
pallor
with
talcum
and
his
mouth
had
been
painted
with
red
salve
into
a
cruel
red
slash
across
his
countenance
chantecler
was
of
a
more
engaging
countenance
a
small
red
felt
bedroom
slipper
formed
his
comb
and
a
red
silk
handkerchief
covered
his
back
hair
the
two
cocks
crowed
and
flapped
their
wings
and
the
fight
began
amid
much
laughter
and
cheering
twice
chantecler
was
almost
spurred
to
death
but
it
was
mahomet
lot
to
die
that
evening
and
presently
he
expired
with
a
terrible
groan
while
the
cock
of
the
west
placed
his
foot
on
chest
and
crowed
a
mighty
crow
for
the
west
had
conquered
the
east
that
was
really
the
great
stunt
of
the
evening
and
it
occupied
a
good
deal
of
time
molly
began
carving
the
ham
which
she
had
refused
to
do
earlier
because
a
ham
properly
served
should
appear
first
in
all
its
splendid
shapely
wholeness
before
being
sliced
into
nothingness
therefore
she
now
proceeded
to
cut
off
thin
portions
which
crumbled
into
bits
under
the
edge
of
the
carving
knife
borrowed
from
murphy
but
the
young
hostess
composedly
heaped
it
upon
the
plates
with
pickle
and
biscuit
and
it
was
eaten
so
quickly
that
she
had
scarcely
finished
the
last
serving
before
the
plates
were
back
again
for
a
second
allowance
during
the
hot
fudge
and
hickory
nut
cake
course
the
door
opened
and
a
scotch
laddie
kilted
and
belted
in
the
most
approved
manner
entered
the
room
his
knees
were
bare
he
wore
a
little
scotch
cap
a
black
velvet
jacket
and
a
plaidie
thrown
over
one
shoulder
but
the
most
perfect
part
of
his
was
his
miniature
bagpipe
which
he
blew
on
vigorously
and
presently
he
paused
and
sang
a
scotch
song
nance
cried
several
of
the
queen
cottage
girls
for
it
was
difficult
to
recognize
the
quiet
young
girl
from
vermont
in
this
rakish
disguise
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
there
was
a
loud
knock
on
the
door
come
in
called
molly
a
little
frightened
thinking
perhaps
the
kindly
matron
had
for
once
rebelled
at
the
noise
they
were
making
slowly
the
door
opened
and
an
old
hag
stepped
into
the
room
she
was
really
a
terrible
object
and
some
of
the
girls
shrieked
and
fell
back
as
she
advanced
toward
the
jolly
circle
her
nose
was
of
enormous
length
and
almost
rested
on
her
chin
like
a
staff
like
the
nose
of
the
last
leaf
on
the
tree
also
she
had
a
crooked
back
and
leaned
heavily
on
a
stick
on
her
head
was
a
high
pointed
witch
cap
she
wore
black
goggles
and
had
only
two
front
teeth
the
witch
produced
a
pack
of
cards
which
she
dexterously
shuffled
with
her
black
gloved
hands
then
she
sat
down
on
the
floor
beckoning
to
the
girls
to
come
nearer
fortune
for
each
one
she
observed
in
a
muffled
disguised
voice
but
it
was
a
very
fulsome
minute
as
judy
remarked
afterward
for
what
little
she
said
was
strictly
to
the
point
to
judith
blount
she
said
english
literature
is
your
weak
point
look
out
for
danger
ahead
this
seemed
simple
enough
advice
but
judith
flushed
darkly
and
several
of
the
girls
exchanged
glances
molly
for
some
reason
recalled
what
judith
had
said
about
professor
edwin
green
many
of
the
other
girls
came
in
for
knocks
but
they
were
very
skillful
ones
deftly
hidden
under
the
guise
of
advice
to
jennie
wren
the
witch
said
be
careful
of
your
friends
do
ever
cultivate
unprofitable
people
to
nance
oldham
she
said
you
will
always
be
very
popular
if
you
stick
to
popular
people
it
was
all
soon
over
molly
fortune
had
been
left
to
the
last
the
strange
witch
had
gone
so
quickly
from
one
girl
to
another
that
they
had
scarcely
time
to
take
a
breath
between
each
fortune
as
for
you
she
said
at
last
turning
to
molly
i
can
only
say
that
hearts
are
more
than
coronets
and
simple
faith
than
norman
blood
and
by
the
end
of
your
freshman
year
you
will
be
the
most
popular
girl
in
college
who
are
you
cried
molly
suddenly
coming
out
of
her
dream
yes
who
are
you
cried
judith
breaking
through
the
circle
and
seizing
the
witch
by
the
arm
with
a
swift
movement
the
witch
pushed
her
back
and
she
fell
in
a
heap
on
some
girls
who
were
still
sitting
on
the
floor
i
will
know
who
you
are
cried
jennie
wren
with
a
determined
note
in
her
high
voice
as
she
grasped
the
witch
by
the
arm
and
it
did
look
for
a
moment
as
if
the
kentucky
spread
were
going
to
end
in
a
fight
when
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
scramble
and
cries
came
three
raps
on
the
door
and
the
voice
of
the
matron
called
young
ladies
ten
lights
out
the
girls
always
declared
that
it
was
the
witch
who
had
got
near
the
door
and
pushed
the
button
which
put
out
every
light
in
the
room
at
any
rate
the
place
was
in
total
darkness
for
half
a
minute
and
when
molly
switched
the
lights
on
again
for
the
girls
to
find
their
wraps
the
witch
had
disappeared
in
another
instant
the
guests
had
vanished
into
thin
air
and
across
the
moonlit
campus
ghostly
figures
could
be
seen
flitting
like
shadows
over
the
turf
toward
the
dormitories
for
there
was
no
time
to
lose
at
a
quarter
past
ten
the
gates
into
the
quadrangle
would
be
securely
locked
nance
lit
a
flat
thick
candle
known
in
the
village
as
terror
and
in
this
flickering
dim
light
the
two
girls
undressed
hastily
suddenly
molly
exclaimed
in
a
whisper
nance
i
believe
it
was
frances
andrews
who
dressed
up
as
that
witch
and
i
going
to
find
out
rules
or
no
rules
she
slipped
on
her
kimono
and
crept
into
the
hall
the
house
was
very
still
but
she
tapped
softly
on
frances
door
there
was
no
answer
and
opening
the
door
she
tiptoed
into
the
room
a
long
ray
of
moonlight
filtering
in
through
the
muslin
curtains
made
the
room
quite
light
there
was
a
smell
of
lavender
salts
in
the
air
and
mollie
could
plainly
see
frances
in
her
bed
a
white
handkerchief
was
tied
around
her
head
as
if
she
had
a
headache
but
she
seemed
to
be
asleep
frances
called
molly
softly
frances
gave
a
stifled
sob
that
was
half
a
groan
and
turned
over
on
her
side
frances
called
molly
again
frances
opened
her
eyes
and
sat
up
is
anything
the
matter
she
asked
molly
went
up
to
the
bedside
even
in
the
moonlight
she
could
see
that
frances
eyes
were
swollen
with
crying
i
was
afraid
you
were
ill
whispered
molly
why
did
you
come
to
the
spread
i
had
a
bad
headache
it
better
now
good
night
molly
crept
off
to
her
room
was
it
frances
after
all
who
had
broken
up
her
party
molly
was
inclined
to
think
it
was
not
and
yet
at
any
rate
we
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
nance
she
whispered
but
there
were
no
doubts
in
nance
mind
chapter
vi
knotty
problems
i
tell
you
things
do
hum
in
this
college
exclaimed
judy
kean
closing
a
book
she
had
been
reading
and
tossing
it
onto
the
couch
with
a
sigh
of
deep
content
i
do
see
how
you
can
tell
anything
about
it
judy
said
nance
severely
you
been
so
absorbed
in
broad
highway
every
spare
moment
you
had
for
the
last
two
days
that
you
might
as
well
have
been
in
kalamazoo
as
in
college
nance
you
do
surely
tell
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
said
judy
good
naturedly
i
know
i
have
the
novel
habit
badly
it
because
i
had
no
restraint
put
upon
me
in
my
youth
and
if
i
get
a
really
good
book
like
this
one
i
just
let
duty
slide
why
do
you
put
your
talents
to
some
use
and
write
then
demanded
nance
who
enjoyed
preaching
to
her
friends
art
is
more
to
my
taste
answered
judy
well
art
is
long
and
time
is
fleeting
why
do
you
get
busy
and
do
something
exclaimed
the
other
vehemently
what
do
you
intend
to
be
judy
had
a
trick
of
raising
her
eyebrows
and
frowning
at
the
same
time
which
gave
her
a
expression
and
invested
her
most
earnest
speeches
with
a
touch
of
humor
but
she
did
not
reply
to
question
having
spent
most
of
her
life
indulging
her
very
excellent
taste
without
much
thought
for
the
future
what
do
you
intend
to
be
she
asked
presently
of
nance
who
had
her
whole
future
mapped
out
in
blocks
four
years
at
college
two
years
studying
languages
in
europe
four
years
as
teacher
in
a
good
school
then
as
principal
perhaps
and
next
as
owner
of
a
school
of
her
own
why
i
expect
to
teach
languages
said
nance
without
a
hesitation
of
course
a
teacher
i
might
have
known
cried
judy
commenced
already
on
me
your
earliest
pupil
teacher
why
am
i
so
happy
happy
happy
in
my
sunday
school
she
broke
off
with
her
song
suddenly
and
seized
nance
hand
please
do
scold
me
nance
dear
i
know
life
is
all
play
and
that
college
is
a
serious
business
if
one
expects
to
take
the
whole
four
years
course
i
already
had
a
warning
it
came
this
morning
because
i
been
cutting
classes
and
i
have
been
entirely
miserable
that
the
reason
i
been
so
immersed
in
broad
highway
been
trying
to
drown
my
sorrows
in
romance
i
know
i
not
clever
nonsense
interrupted
the
other
impatiently
you
are
too
clever
you
silly
child
that
what
is
the
matter
with
you
but
you
do
know
how
to
work
you
have
no
system
what
you
really
need
is
a
good
tutor
you
must
learn
to
concentrate
concentrate
laughed
judy
that
something
i
never
could
do
as
soon
as
i
try
my
thoughts
go
skylarking
how
do
you
do
it
well
i
sit
very
still
and
dig
my
toes
into
the
soles
of
my
shoes
and
my
finger
nails
into
the
palms
of
my
hands
and
say
over
and
over
the
thing
i
trying
to
concentrate
on
the
girls
were
still
laughing
joyously
when
molly
came
in
her
face
wore
an
expression
of
unwonted
seriousness
and
she
was
frowning
slightly
three
things
had
happened
that
morning
which
worried
her
considerably
the
first
shock
came
before
breakfast
when
she
had
looked
in
her
handkerchief
box
where
she
kept
her
funds
promiscuously
mixed
up
with
handkerchiefs
and
orris
root
sachet
bags
and
found
one
crumpled
dollar
bill
and
not
a
cent
more
there
was
a
kind
of
blind
spot
in
brain
where
money
was
concerned
little
of
it
as
she
had
possessed
in
her
life
she
never
could
remember
exactly
how
much
she
had
on
hand
and
change
was
a
meaningless
thing
to
her
and
now
it
was
something
of
a
blow
to
her
to
find
that
one
dollar
must
bridge
over
the
expenses
or
she
must
write
home
for
more
a
thing
she
did
not
wish
to
do
remembering
the
two
acres
of
apple
orchard
which
had
been
sunk
in
her
education
and
it
all
gone
in
silk
attire
and
riotous
living
she
said
to
herself
for
she
had
bought
herself
ten
yards
of
a
heavenly
sky
blue
cr√™pey
material
which
she
and
nance
proposed
to
make
into
a
grand
costume
also
she
had
entertained
numbers
of
friends
at
various
times
to
sundaes
in
the
village
one
of
the
other
of
her
triple
worries
was
a
note
she
had
received
that
morning
from
judith
blount
and
the
third
was
another
note
about
both
of
which
she
intended
to
ask
the
advice
of
her
two
most
intimate
friends
what
bothering
you
child
demanded
judy
quick
to
notice
any
change
in
her
adored
molly
face
oh
several
things
these
two
notes
for
one
she
drew
two
envelopes
from
her
pocket
and
opening
the
first
one
began
to
read
aloud
miss
brown
you
come
of
a
family
of
cooks
and
are
expert
on
the
subject
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
take
charge
of
a
little
dinner
i
am
giving
night
in
my
rooms
to
my
brother
and
some
friends
i
shall
expect
you
to
be
chief
cook
but
not
you
have
an
assistant
for
that
but
i
like
you
to
wait
on
the
table
seeing
you
are
so
good
at
those
things
do
bother
about
cap
and
apron
i
have
them
with
thanks
in
advance
blount
the
note
was
written
on
heavy
paper
with
two
greek
letters
embossed
at
the
top
in
dark
blue
judith
lived
in
the
beta
phi
house
which
was
divided
into
apartments
and
occupied
by
eight
decidedly
girls
the
richest
girls
in
college
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
called
the
millionaire
club
and
was
known
to
be
the
abode
of
snobbishness
although
molly
who
had
been
there
once
to
a
tea
had
been
entirely
unconscious
of
this
spirit
judy
and
nance
were
speechless
with
indignation
after
molly
had
finished
reading
the
note
what
do
you
think
of
that
she
exclaimed
breaking
the
silence
it
a
rank
insult
cried
nance
if
you
were
a
man
you
could
challenge
her
to
a
duel
cried
judy
but
being
a
girl
you
have
to
take
it
out
in
ignoring
her
it
written
in
such
a
way
continued
molly
that
i
ca
believe
it
entirely
unusual
after
sober
second
thought
i
believe
i
ask
sallie
before
i
answer
it
speaking
of
angels
there
is
sallie
cried
judy
as
that
young
woman
herself
hurried
past
the
door
on
her
way
to
a
class
what
is
it
make
it
quick
i
late
now
ejaculated
sallie
popping
her
head
in
at
the
door
with
a
smile
on
her
face
to
counteract
her
abrupt
manner
who
in
trouble
now
the
three
freshmen
stood
silently
about
her
while
she
perused
note
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
thing
burst
out
judy
with
hot
indignation
oh
yes
lots
of
times
little
one
it
quite
customary
for
freshmen
to
act
as
waitresses
when
girls
in
the
older
classes
entertain
in
their
rooms
the
freshies
like
to
do
it
because
they
get
such
good
food
i
do
think
this
note
is
expressed
well
rather
unfortunately
it
has
a
sort
of
superiority
but
judith
is
always
like
that
you
just
have
to
take
her
as
you
find
her
and
ignore
her
faults
better
accept
molly
with
good
grace
you
enjoy
the
food
too
let
me
see
that
new
england
boiled
dinner
night
is
it
you
probably
have
beefsteak
and
mushrooms
and
grape
fruit
and
ice
cream
and
all
the
delicacies
of
the
season
very
well
if
you
advise
it
i
accept
like
a
lady
said
molly
resignedly
it
customary
answered
sallie
smiling
cheerfully
and
waving
her
hand
as
she
hurried
down
the
hall
well
that
settled
continued
molly
sighing
somehow
judith
blount
did
get
on
her
nerves
now
the
other
note
is
even
more
serious
in
a
way
listen
to
this
before
reading
it
she
carefully
closed
the
door
drew
the
other
girls
into
the
far
end
of
the
room
and
began
in
a
low
voice
miss
brown
i
have
the
pleasure
of
being
your
escort
to
the
ball
let
me
know
whether
you
intend
to
wear
one
of
your
cerulean
shades
the
carriage
will
stop
for
us
at
eight
you
might
leave
the
answer
at
my
door
faithfully
andrews
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
in
consternation
what
to
be
done
say
you
have
another
engagement
advised
judy
who
was
not
averse
at
times
to
telling
polite
fibs
in
order
to
extricate
herself
from
a
difficulty
but
molly
was
the
very
soul
of
truth
and
even
small
fibs
were
not
in
her
line
has
any
one
else
asked
you
yet
asked
nance
no
you
see
it
a
week
off
and
i
suppose
they
are
just
beginning
to
think
of
partners
now
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
you
do
go
with
her
you
are
done
for
announced
nance
solemnly
molly
sat
down
in
the
morris
chair
and
wrinkled
her
brows
i
do
wish
she
had
she
said
she
just
regards
you
as
a
sort
of
life
preserver
exclaimed
judy
she
trying
to
keep
above
the
surface
by
holding
on
to
you
if
i
were
you
i
would
be
bothered
with
her
of
course
i
know
said
molly
that
frances
andrews
did
something
last
year
that
put
her
in
the
black
books
with
her
class
she
trying
to
live
it
down
and
they
are
trying
to
freeze
her
out
nobody
has
anything
to
do
with
her
and
she
not
invited
to
anything
except
the
big
entertainments
like
this
i
ca
help
feeling
sorry
for
her
and
i
do
see
how
it
would
do
me
any
harm
to
go
with
her
but
i
just
want
to
go
that
all
i
rather
take
a
beating
than
go
well
then
you
are
a
chump
for
considering
it
exclaimed
judy
whose
nature
had
little
sympathy
for
people
who
would
do
uncomfortable
things
then
on
the
other
hand
continued
molly
suppose
my
going
would
help
her
a
little
do
you
think
it
would
be
mean
to
turn
her
down
oh
say
you
think
i
ought
to
do
it
because
i
going
to
hard
as
it
seems
nance
went
over
and
put
her
arms
around
her
friend
quite
an
unusual
demonstration
with
her
while
judy
seized
her
hand
and
patted
it
tenderly
really
molly
you
are
quite
the
nicest
person
in
the
world
she
exclaimed
then
she
added
by
the
way
molly
can
you
spare
the
time
to
tutor
me
for
a
month
or
so
i
do
know
what
the
rates
are
but
we
can
settle
about
that
later
nance
tells
me
i
must
get
busy
or
else
take
my
walking
papers
i
be
afraid
of
a
strange
tutor
i
a
timid
creature
but
i
think
i
might
manage
to
learn
a
few
things
from
you
molly
dear
did
judy
understand
the
look
of
immense
relief
which
instantly
appeared
on
molly
sensitive
face
if
she
did
she
made
no
sign
now
do
say
no
she
went
on
i
know
you
are
awfully
busy
and
all
that
but
it
would
be
just
an
act
of
common
charity
say
no
cried
molly
laughing
lightly
i
can
hardly
wait
to
say
yes
and
she
cheerfully
got
out
six
pairs
of
muddy
boots
from
the
closet
enveloped
herself
in
a
large
apron
slipped
on
a
pair
of
old
gloves
and
went
to
work
to
clean
and
black
them
molly
had
become
official
bootblack
at
queen
cottage
at
ten
cents
a
pair
when
they
were
not
muddy
and
fifteen
cents
when
they
were
when
she
had
completed
her
lowly
job
she
sat
down
at
her
desk
and
wrote
two
notes
one
was
to
judith
blount
in
which
she
accepted
her
invitation
to
wait
at
table
in
the
most
polite
and
correct
terms
and
signed
her
name
mary
carmichael
washington
brown
the
second
letter
which
was
to
frances
andrews
was
also
a
note
of
acceptance
then
molly
removed
her
collar
rolled
up
her
sleeves
kicked
off
her
pumps
a
signal
that
she
was
going
to
begin
work
and
sat
down
to
cram
mathematics
the
very
hardest
thing
in
life
to
her
and
the
subject
which
was
to
be
a
stumbling
block
in
her
progress
always
chapter
vii
an
incident
of
the
coffee
cups
molly
turned
up
at
the
beta
phi
house
about
five
the
next
evening
she
wore
a
blue
linen
so
that
if
any
grease
sputtered
it
would
fall
harmlessly
on
wash
goods
and
in
other
ways
attired
herself
as
much
like
a
maid
as
possible
with
white
collar
and
cuffs
and
a
very
plain
tight
arrangement
of
the
hair
if
i
to
be
a
servant
i
might
as
well
look
like
one
she
thought
as
she
marched
upstairs
and
rapped
on
judith
door
come
in
called
the
voice
of
jennie
wren
judith
gone
walking
with
her
guests
she
explained
but
she
left
her
orders
with
me
and
transmit
them
to
you
she
added
rather
grandly
you
are
to
do
the
cooking
here
are
all
the
things
in
the
ice
box
and
there
the
gas
stove
on
the
trunk
miss
brinton
and
i
will
set
the
table
molly
gathered
that
caroline
brinton
the
unbending
young
woman
from
philadelphia
had
been
chosen
as
her
assistant
the
tiny
ice
box
was
stuffed
full
of
provisions
there
was
the
inevitable
beefsteak
as
sallie
had
predicted
also
canned
soup
a
head
of
celery
olives
grape
fruits
olive
oil
mushrooms
cheese
really
a
bewildering
display
of
food
stuffs
did
miss
blount
decide
on
the
courses
molly
asked
jennie
wren
no
she
got
the
raw
material
and
left
the
rest
entirely
with
you
her
to
get
up
a
good
dinner
for
six
people
she
said
do
care
how
she
does
it
only
she
must
have
it
promptly
at
there
were
only
two
holes
to
the
gas
stove
and
likewise
only
two
saucepans
to
fit
over
them
so
that
it
behooved
molly
to
look
alive
if
she
were
to
prepare
dinner
for
six
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
where
the
can
opener
she
called
a
calm
experienced
cook
with
the
patience
of
a
saint
might
have
felt
some
slight
irritability
if
she
had
been
placed
in
molly
shoes
that
evening
nothing
could
be
found
there
was
no
can
opener
no
ice
pick
the
coffeepot
had
a
limited
capacity
of
four
cups
and
there
was
no
broiler
for
the
steak
it
had
to
be
cooked
in
a
pan
it
must
be
confessed
also
that
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
molly
had
ever
cooked
an
entire
meal
she
had
only
made
what
her
grandmother
would
have
called
covered
dishes
or
surprise
dishes
and
she
now
found
preparing
a
dinner
of
four
courses
for
six
people
rather
a
bewildering
task
at
last
there
came
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
next
room
she
put
on
the
beefsteak
her
cheeks
were
flaming
from
the
heat
of
the
little
stove
her
back
ached
from
leaning
over
and
her
head
ached
with
responsibility
and
excitement
is
everything
all
right
demanded
judith
blowing
into
the
room
with
an
air
of
if
it
is
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
i
believe
so
answered
molly
why
did
you
put
the
anchovies
on
crackers
demanded
the
older
girl
irritably
they
should
have
been
on
toast
because
there
was
enough
bread
for
one
thing
and
because
there
was
no
way
to
toast
it
if
there
had
been
answered
molly
shortly
no
cook
likes
to
be
interfered
with
at
that
crucial
moment
just
before
dinner
here
are
your
cap
and
apron
went
on
judith
you
know
how
to
wait
do
you
always
hand
things
at
the
left
side
water
happens
to
be
poured
from
the
right
answered
molly
pinning
on
the
little
muslin
cap
she
was
in
no
mood
to
be
dictated
to
by
judith
blount
or
any
other
vixen
judith
made
no
answer
she
seemed
excited
and
caroline
placed
the
anchovies
while
molly
poured
the
soup
into
cups
there
being
no
plates
the
voices
of
the
company
floated
in
to
her
jennie
wren
had
joined
them
making
the
sixth
she
heard
a
man
voice
exclaim
i
say
i
call
this
very
luxurious
we
never
had
anything
so
fine
as
this
at
harvard
you
always
could
hold
up
the
parent
and
get
what
you
wanted
now
i
never
had
the
nerve
and
by
the
way
have
you
got
a
cook
too
only
for
answered
judith
we
usually
eat
downstairs
with
the
others
you
working
some
poor
little
freshman
ten
to
one
answered
judith
brother
for
that
was
evidently
who
it
was
then
molly
heard
some
one
run
up
a
brilliant
scale
and
strike
a
chord
and
a
good
baritone
voice
began
singing
i
a
cook
and
a
captain
bold
and
a
mate
of
the
nancy
brig
and
a
tight
and
a
midshipmatemite
and
the
crew
of
the
captain
gig
why
do
you
join
in
eddie
but
i
forgot
it
would
never
do
for
a
professor
of
english
literature
at
a
girls
college
to
lift
his
voice
in
ribald
song
some
one
laughed
molly
recognized
the
voice
instantly
she
knew
that
professor
edwin
green
was
dining
at
judith
that
night
and
her
inquiring
mind
reached
out
even
further
into
the
realms
of
conjecture
and
she
guessed
who
was
the
author
of
his
light
opera
cousin
edwin
will
you
sit
there
next
to
me
said
judith
voice
cousin
repeated
molly
so
that
it
is
it
then
other
voices
joined
in
mary
stewart
jennie
wren
and
martha
schaeffer
a
rich
girl
from
chicago
who
roomed
in
that
house
they
gobbled
down
the
first
course
as
people
usually
dispatch
relishes
and
as
caroline
removed
the
dishes
molly
appeared
with
the
soup
none
of
the
girls
recognized
her
of
course
which
was
perfectly
good
college
etiquette
although
mary
stewart
smiled
when
molly
placed
her
cup
of
soup
and
whispered
good
work
molly
gave
her
a
grateful
look
and
professor
edwin
green
looking
up
caught
a
glimpse
of
molly
flushed
face
and
smiled
too
i
say
who
your
head
waitress
molly
could
not
help
overhearing
richard
blount
ask
when
she
had
left
the
room
oh
just
a
little
southern
girl
named
smith
or
something
answered
judith
carelessly
that
young
lady
said
professor
edwin
green
is
miss
molly
brown
of
kentucky
the
young
freshman
face
was
crimson
when
she
brought
in
the
steak
and
placed
it
in
front
of
blount
then
she
took
her
stand
correctly
behind
his
chair
with
a
plate
in
her
hand
waiting
for
him
to
carve
sometimes
two
members
of
the
same
family
are
so
unlike
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
blood
from
the
same
stock
runs
in
their
veins
so
it
was
with
richard
blount
and
his
sister
judith
she
was
tall
and
dark
and
arrogant
and
he
was
short
and
blond
and
full
of
gayety
he
rallied
all
the
girls
at
the
table
he
teased
his
cousin
edwin
he
teased
his
sister
and
then
he
ended
by
highly
praising
the
food
looking
all
the
time
from
one
corner
of
his
mild
blue
eyes
at
molly
flushed
face
really
he
exclaimed
a
french
chef
must
have
broiled
this
steak
not
even
delmonico
nor
oscar
himself
at
the
waldorf
could
have
done
it
better
is
it
the
eddie
what
this
mushroom
sauce
by
jupiter
it
wonderful
to
come
out
here
in
the
wilds
and
get
such
food
mary
stewart
began
to
laugh
after
all
it
was
just
raillery
why
blount
she
said
there
is
something
to
be
found
here
that
is
lots
better
than
steak
what
is
it
name
it
please
cried
richard
if
i
must
miss
the
train
i
must
have
some
whatever
it
is
cream
puffs
or
chocolate
fudge
it
kentucky
ham
of
the
finest
what
do
you
call
it
breed
three
years
old
you
never
eaten
ham
until
you
tasted
it
she
smiled
charmingly
at
molly
who
pretended
to
look
unconscious
while
she
passed
the
vegetables
judith
endeavored
to
change
the
subject
she
was
angry
with
mary
for
thus
bringing
her
freshman
waitress
into
prominence
but
molly
was
destined
to
be
the
heroine
of
the
evening
in
spite
of
all
efforts
against
it
old
kentucky
ham
cried
richard
blount
starting
from
his
chair
with
mock
seriousness
where
is
it
i
implore
you
to
tell
me
my
soul
cries
out
for
old
ham
from
the
dark
and
bloody
battleground
of
kentucky
everybody
began
to
laugh
and
judith
exclaimed
do
hush
richard
you
are
so
absurd
did
he
behave
this
way
at
harvard
all
the
time
cousin
edwin
oh
yes
only
more
so
but
tell
me
more
of
this
wonderful
ham
miss
stewart
molly
wondered
if
professor
green
really
understood
that
it
was
all
a
joke
on
her
when
he
asked
that
question
suddenly
she
formed
a
resolution
following
her
assistant
into
the
next
room
she
whispered
which
would
you
rather
do
miss
brinton
go
over
to
queen
and
ask
nance
to
give
you
the
rest
of
my
ham
or
wait
on
the
table
while
i
go
i
rather
get
the
ham
replied
miss
brinton
whose
proud
spirit
was
crushed
by
the
menial
service
she
had
been
obliged
to
undertake
that
evening
the
dinner
progressed
in
a
little
while
molly
had
cleared
the
table
and
was
preparing
to
bring
on
the
salad
when
caroline
appeared
with
the
remnants
of
the
ham
molly
removed
it
from
its
wrappings
and
placing
it
on
a
dish
bore
it
triumphantly
into
the
next
room
what
this
cried
richard
blount
do
my
eyes
deceive
me
am
i
dreaming
is
it
possible
the
old
ham
or
rather
the
attenuated
ghost
of
the
old
ham
ejaculated
mary
stewart
even
judith
joined
in
the
burst
of
merriment
and
professor
laugh
was
the
gayest
of
all
molly
returned
with
the
carving
knife
and
fork
and
richard
blount
began
to
snip
off
small
pieces
bone
am
very
sweet
he
sang
one
eye
on
molly
it
is
certainly
wonderful
exclaimed
professor
green
as
he
tasted
the
delicate
meat
but
it
seems
like
robbery
to
deprive
the
owner
of
it
now
edwin
you
keep
quiet
please
interrupted
richard
i
heard
that
some
owners
of
old
hams
are
just
as
fond
of
things
sweeter
than
ham
bones
a
box
ought
to
be
the
equivalent
of
this
eh
really
richard
you
go
too
far
put
in
judith
frowning
at
her
brother
but
richard
took
not
the
slightest
notice
of
her
nor
did
he
pause
until
he
had
cleaned
the
ham
bone
of
every
scrap
of
meat
left
on
it
are
you
going
to
catch
your
train
asked
judith
i
think
not
he
answered
smiling
amiably
edwin
can
you
put
me
up
if
not
i
stop
at
the
inn
in
the
village
no
indeed
you
wo
dick
you
must
stop
with
me
i
have
an
extra
bed
solely
in
hopes
you
might
stay
in
it
some
night
and
later
this
evening
we
might
run
over
er
a
few
notes
he
looked
consciously
at
richard
then
he
gave
molly
a
swift
quizzical
glance
remembering
probably
that
he
had
confided
to
her
and
her
alone
that
he
was
the
author
of
the
words
of
a
comic
opera
having
cleared
the
table
molly
now
returned
with
the
coffee
the
cups
jaggled
as
she
handed
them
she
was
very
weary
and
her
arms
ached
when
she
had
reached
professor
edwin
green
richard
blount
with
his
nervous
quick
manner
suddenly
started
from
his
chair
and
exclaimed
now
i
know
whom
you
remind
me
of
ellen
terry
at
sixteen
nobody
but
molly
realized
for
a
moment
that
he
was
talking
to
her
and
she
was
so
startled
that
her
wrist
gave
a
twist
and
over
went
the
tray
and
three
full
coffee
cups
straight
on
to
the
knees
of
the
august
professor
of
english
literature
there
was
a
great
deal
of
noise
molly
remembered
she
herself
was
so
horrified
and
stunned
that
she
stood
immovable
clutching
the
tray
wildly
as
a
drowning
person
clings
to
a
life
preserver
she
heard
judith
cry
how
stupid
how
could
you
have
been
so
unpardonably
awkward
at
the
same
moment
mary
stewart
said
it
was
entirely
your
fault
blount
you
frightened
the
poor
child
with
your
wild
behavior
and
professor
green
said
do
scold
judith
i
to
blame
i
joggled
the
tray
with
my
elbow
there
no
harm
done
at
any
rate
these
gray
trousers
will
be
much
improved
by
being
dyed
au
then
richard
blount
rose
from
the
table
and
marched
straight
over
to
where
molly
was
standing
transfixed
still
miserably
holding
to
the
tray
miss
brown
he
said
humbly
i
want
to
apologize
all
this
must
have
been
very
trying
for
you
and
you
have
behaved
beautifully
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
my
only
excuse
is
that
i
am
always
forgetting
my
little
sister
and
her
friends
are
not
still
children
will
you
forgive
me
he
looked
so
manly
and
standing
there
before
her
with
his
hand
held
out
that
molly
felt
what
slight
indignation
there
was
in
her
heart
melting
away
at
once
she
put
her
hand
in
his
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
blount
she
said
and
the
young
man
who
was
a
musician
pricked
up
his
ears
when
he
heard
that
soft
musical
voice
and
i
robbed
you
of
your
ham
he
continued
it
was
a
pleasure
to
know
you
enjoyed
it
she
said
presently
molly
began
clearing
the
table
richard
sat
down
at
the
piano
it
was
evident
that
he
never
wandered
far
from
his
beloved
instrument
and
the
girls
gathered
around
him
while
he
ran
over
the
first
act
of
his
new
opera
professor
edwin
green
said
good
night
and
took
himself
and
his
trousers
home
to
his
rooms
you
can
follow
later
dickie
he
called
as
he
passed
molly
standing
by
the
door
he
smiled
at
her
again
and
molly
smiled
back
though
she
was
quite
ready
to
cry
the
ham
was
delicious
he
said
thank
you
very
much
that
night
when
molly
had
wearily
climbed
the
stairs
to
her
room
and
flung
herself
on
her
couch
nance
writing
at
her
desk
called
over
well
how
was
the
beefsteak
i
did
get
any
said
molly
even
if
there
had
been
any
left
i
was
too
tired
to
eat
anything
i
afraid
i
was
born
to
be
cook
nance
or
waitress
either
and
molly
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
wept
silently
lest
we
forget
we
will
say
now
that
two
days
after
this
episode
of
the
coffee
cups
there
came
by
express
for
miss
molly
brown
a
box
of
candy
without
a
card
and
the
girls
at
queen
cottage
feasted
right
royally
for
almost
two
evenings
chapter
viii
concerning
clubs
and
a
tea
party
at
the
first
meeting
of
the
freshman
class
of
margaret
wakefield
of
washington
had
been
elected
president
just
how
this
came
about
no
one
could
exactly
say
she
could
not
have
been
accused
of
electioneering
for
herself
and
yet
she
made
an
impression
somehow
and
had
won
the
election
by
a
large
majority
anybody
who
can
talk
like
that
ought
to
be
president
of
something
molly
had
observed
good
naturedly
she
could
make
a
real
inauguration
speech
i
believe
and
she
knows
all
about
parliamentary
law
whatever
that
is
she
dashed
off
the
class
constitution
just
as
easily
as
if
she
were
writing
a
letter
home
said
judy
that
not
so
easy
either
added
nance
mournfully
the
girls
were
silent
it
had
gradually
leaked
out
as
their
friendship
progressed
that
nance
home
was
not
an
abode
of
happiness
by
any
means
and
yet
nance
had
written
a
theme
on
home
which
was
so
well
done
that
she
had
been
highly
complimented
by
miss
pomeroy
who
had
read
it
aloud
to
the
class
molly
often
wondered
just
what
manner
of
woman
mother
was
and
she
soon
had
an
opportunity
of
finding
out
for
herself
but
the
conversation
about
the
new
class
president
continued
president
wakefield
wants
us
to
have
meetings
continued
judy
she
wishes
to
divide
the
class
into
committees
and
have
a
chairman
for
each
committee
committees
for
what
demanded
molly
dear
knows
laughed
judy
but
her
father
a
congressman
and
she
has
inherited
his
passion
for
law
and
order
i
suppose
she
wants
to
conduct
a
debate
on
woman
suffrage
to
meet
saturdays
it
to
be
called
woman
franchise
club
and
she
wishes
to
establish
and
resolutions
and
a
number
of
other
things
that
are
greek
to
me
for
political
body
corporate
she
says
it
a
crying
shame
that
women
know
so
little
about
the
constitution
of
their
own
country
and
in
establishing
a
debating
society
she
hopes
to
do
some
missionary
work
in
that
line
judy
had
risen
and
was
waving
her
arms
dramatically
while
her
voice
rose
and
fell
like
an
orator
i
suppose
we
ought
said
molly
but
i
rather
put
it
off
a
year
or
so
there
are
so
many
other
things
to
enjoy
first
besides
it
will
be
four
years
before
i
reach
the
voting
age
and
by
that
time
i
hope
my
will
have
developed
sufficiently
to
take
in
the
constitution
of
the
country
anyhow
exclaimed
judy
i
proud
to
have
a
class
president
such
a
public
speaker
because
it
takes
it
all
off
our
shoulders
whenever
there
a
speech
to
be
made
or
anything
public
and
embarrassing
to
be
done
we
just
vote
for
her
to
do
it
because
she
will
enjoy
it
so
much
but
are
you
going
to
join
the
debating
club
asked
nance
i
suppose
it
our
duty
to
replied
molly
but
i
do
hate
to
pin
myself
down
suppose
we
say
we
go
to
one
and
listen
well
you
better
settle
it
now
because
here
comes
the
president
sailing
up
the
walk
she
going
the
rounds
now
i
suppose
and
in
another
two
minutes
she
be
springing
the
question
on
us
judy
who
was
sitting
at
the
front
window
of
her
own
room
nodded
down
into
the
yard
and
smiled
politely
and
the
girls
had
just
time
to
settle
among
themselves
what
they
were
going
to
say
when
there
was
a
smart
rap
on
the
door
and
president
wakefield
entered
she
wore
rather
clothes
and
carried
a
suit
case
in
one
hand
and
a
notebook
in
the
other
hello
girls
she
began
i
so
glad
i
caught
you
together
it
saves
telling
over
the
same
thing
three
times
i
want
to
know
first
exactly
how
you
stand
on
the
woman
suffrage
question
now
do
be
afraid
to
be
frank
about
it
and
speak
your
minds
of
course
i
sure
that
being
women
who
are
seeking
the
higher
education
you
are
all
of
you
on
the
right
side
the
side
of
the
thinking
woman
of
here
judy
sneezed
so
violently
that
she
almost
upset
the
little
tea
table
at
her
elbow
how
do
you
feel
on
the
subject
molly
molly
smiled
broadly
while
nance
cleared
her
throat
and
judy
blew
her
nose
and
exclaimed
i
think
i
must
be
taking
cold
excuse
me
while
i
get
a
sweater
and
disappeared
in
the
closet
i
i
afraid
i
do
know
very
much
about
the
subject
margaret
you
see
i
was
brought
up
in
the
country
and
i
have
had
a
chance
to
go
into
woman
suffrage
very
deeply
there
is
no
time
like
the
present
for
beginning
then
said
margaret
promptly
opening
the
little
suit
case
read
these
two
pamphlets
and
you
get
the
gist
of
the
entire
subject
clearly
and
concisely
expressed
i
will
call
on
you
for
an
opinion
next
week
after
you
had
time
to
study
the
question
a
bit
molly
took
the
pamphlets
and
began
hastily
turning
the
leaves
she
wanted
to
laugh
but
she
felt
certain
it
would
offend
margaret
deeply
not
to
be
taken
seriously
and
she
controlled
her
facial
muscles
with
an
effort
while
she
waited
for
attack
no
two
nance
have
you
taken
any
interest
in
this
question
continued
margaret
who
seemed
to
have
the
patience
of
a
fanatic
spreading
his
belief
i
know
something
about
it
replied
nance
quietly
you
see
my
mother
is
president
of
a
woman
suffrage
association
and
she
spends
most
of
her
time
going
about
the
country
making
speeches
for
the
national
association
what
is
your
mother
anna
oldham
the
famous
clubwoman
cried
margaret
nance
nodded
her
head
silently
why
she
is
one
of
the
greatest
authorities
on
women
suffrage
in
the
country
exclaimed
margaret
with
great
enthusiasm
it
says
so
here
look
it
gives
a
little
sketch
of
her
life
and
titles
she
is
president
of
two
big
societies
and
an
officer
in
five
others
it
all
in
this
little
book
called
club
women
in
america
and
england
dear
me
continued
margaret
modestly
i
think
i
better
resign
and
give
the
chair
to
you
nance
i
nobody
to
be
preaching
to
you
when
you
must
know
the
subject
from
beginning
to
end
nance
smiled
in
her
curious
whimsical
way
have
you
ever
eaten
too
much
of
something
margaret
she
said
and
then
hated
it
ever
afterward
why
yes
replied
the
president
that
has
happened
to
every
one
i
suppose
mince
pie
and
i
have
been
strangers
to
each
other
for
many
years
on
that
account
well
continued
nance
i
been
fed
on
clubs
until
i
feel
like
a
strausberg
goose
i
had
them
crammed
down
my
throat
since
i
was
five
years
old
when
i
was
twelve
i
was
my
mother
secretary
and
i
sent
off
thousands
of
just
such
pamphlets
as
you
are
distributing
now
i
learned
to
write
on
the
typewriter
so
i
could
copy
my
mother
speeches
i
been
usher
at
club
conventions
and
page
at
committee
meetings
distributed
hundreds
of
badges
with
for
women
printed
on
them
i
had
to
make
a
hundred
copies
of
mother
speech
on
constitution
and
of
the
united
states
and
send
them
to
a
hundred
different
women
clubs
so
you
see
she
added
simply
frowning
to
keep
back
her
tears
i
think
i
take
a
rest
from
clubs
while
i
at
college
and
begin
to
enjoy
life
a
little
with
molly
and
judy
margaret
wakefield
who
was
really
a
very
nice
girl
and
exceedingly
leaned
over
and
placed
a
firm
rather
large
hand
on
nance
i
should
think
you
had
had
enough
she
exclaimed
giving
the
hand
a
warm
squeeze
seeing
teardrops
glistening
in
nance
eyes
she
rose
and
started
to
the
door
if
ever
you
do
want
to
come
to
any
of
the
meetings
you
will
be
very
welcome
girls
she
said
but
you
want
to
overdo
anything
in
life
you
know
and
if
there
are
things
that
interest
you
more
than
woman
suffrage
you
ought
to
sacrifice
yourselves
people
should
follow
their
own
bent
i
think
she
went
on
smiling
brightly
and
do
bother
to
read
the
pamphlets
molly
dear
if
you
do
want
to
it
a
poor
way
to
carry
a
point
to
make
a
bugbear
of
the
subject
she
went
out
quietly
and
closed
the
door
i
call
her
a
perfect
lady
exclaimed
molly
trying
not
to
look
at
nance
but
wishing
at
the
same
time
that
her
friend
would
give
way
just
once
and
have
a
good
cry
let
cut
study
this
afternoon
and
take
a
walk
exclaimed
judy
trot
along
and
get
on
your
sweaters
it
much
too
glorious
to
stay
indoors
nance
ca
you
do
your
theme
after
supper
molly
you
look
a
little
peaked
it
will
do
you
good
to
breathe
the
fresh
untainted
air
of
the
pine
woods
judy
it
must
be
confessed
was
always
glad
of
a
good
excuse
to
get
away
from
her
books
splendid
cried
molly
with
enthusiasm
and
i
bring
my
english
tea
basket
went
on
judy
who
got
any
cookies
i
have
said
nance
now
fully
recovered
in
five
minutes
the
three
girls
had
started
across
the
campus
to
the
road
and
presently
were
making
for
the
pine
woods
that
bordered
the
pretty
lake
everybody
seemed
to
be
out
roaming
the
country
that
beautiful
autumn
afternoon
parties
of
girls
came
swinging
past
who
had
been
on
long
tramps
through
the
woods
and
over
to
the
distant
hills
which
formed
a
blue
and
misty
background
to
the
lovely
rolling
country
the
lake
was
dotted
with
canoes
and
rowboats
and
from
far
down
the
road
that
wound
its
way
through
the
valley
there
came
the
sound
of
singing
presently
a
of
girls
emerged
into
view
followed
by
another
wagon
filled
with
autumn
leaves
and
evergreens
it
the
sophomore
committee
on
decoration
judy
explained
apparently
she
knew
everything
that
happened
at
college
they
are
getting
the
decorations
for
the
gym
for
the
ball
night
molly
quickly
changed
the
subject
she
had
had
two
invitations
to
go
to
the
ball
since
she
had
accepted
frances
offer
and
several
of
the
sophomores
had
been
to
see
her
to
ask
her
to
change
her
mind
but
having
given
her
word
molly
intended
to
keep
it
no
matter
what
was
to
pay
let
go
to
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
she
suggested
it
wilder
and
much
prettier
and
she
led
the
way
briskly
along
the
path
through
the
pine
woods
in
a
little
while
they
came
out
at
the
other
end
of
the
small
body
of
water
where
the
woods
abruptly
ended
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
called
round
head
which
the
girls
proceeded
to
climb
from
this
eminence
could
be
seen
a
widespreading
panorama
of
hills
and
valleys
little
streams
and
bits
of
forests
and
beyond
the
pine
woods
the
college
itself
its
campus
spread
at
its
feet
like
a
mat
of
emerald
green
the
girls
paused
breathlessly
and
judy
put
down
her
tea
basket
here
where
a
little
refreshment
might
be
very
welcome
she
said
opening
her
basket
of
which
she
was
justly
proud
for
not
many
girls
at
wellington
could
boast
of
such
a
possession
she
filled
the
little
kettle
from
the
bottle
of
water
she
had
taken
the
precaution
to
bring
along
and
they
sat
down
in
a
circle
on
the
turf
the
autumn
had
been
a
dry
one
and
the
ground
was
not
damp
nibbling
cookies
and
sweet
chocolate
they
waited
for
the
water
to
boil
look
here
comes
some
one
whispered
judy
indicating
the
figure
of
a
man
appearing
around
the
side
of
the
hill
i
do
hope
it
not
a
tramp
exclaimed
nance
uneasily
molly
brown
hoped
so
too
although
she
said
nothing
but
she
felt
nervous
as
who
would
in
that
lonely
place
as
the
man
came
nearer
it
became
plain
that
he
was
making
straight
for
them
and
he
did
most
assuredly
look
like
a
wanderer
of
some
kind
he
was
dressed
in
an
old
suit
of
rough
gray
wore
an
old
felt
hat
and
carried
a
staff
like
a
pilgrim
the
girls
sat
quite
still
and
said
nothing
there
had
been
a
silent
understanding
among
them
that
it
was
better
not
to
run
as
the
man
drew
nearer
molly
became
suddenly
conscious
of
the
fact
that
across
the
gray
trousers
just
above
the
knees
was
a
deep
stain
the
next
moment
the
man
stood
before
them
leaning
on
his
staff
his
hat
under
his
arm
it
was
epim√©nides
antinous
green
confess
now
he
said
smiling
at
all
of
them
and
looking
at
molly
whom
he
knew
best
of
the
three
you
took
me
for
a
tramp
not
exactly
for
a
tramp
answered
molly
but
for
one
who
tramps
what
the
difference
miss
brown
he
asked
laughing
oh
everything
clothes
she
paused
blushing
deeply
her
eyes
had
fallen
on
the
coffee
stain
why
does
he
have
it
cleaned
off
she
thought
frowning
slightly
and
and
looks
she
continued
out
loud
even
in
the
walk
judy
finished
perhaps
we
can
give
you
a
cup
of
tea
professor
she
added
politely
the
professor
was
only
too
glad
for
a
cup
of
tea
he
had
been
roaming
the
hills
all
day
he
said
and
he
was
tired
and
thirsty
while
he
sipped
the
fragrant
beverage
he
glanced
at
his
watch
the
truth
is
i
had
an
appointment
at
this
spot
at
he
announced
i
was
to
meet
my
young
brother
george
familiarly
known
as
he
at
exmoor
college
ten
miles
over
and
was
to
walk
across
the
valley
to
the
rendezvous
and
i
was
to
conduct
him
safely
to
my
rooms
for
supper
he
was
afraid
to
enter
the
college
by
the
front
gate
for
fear
of
meeting
several
hundreds
of
young
women
he
runs
like
a
scared
rabbit
if
he
sees
a
girl
a
block
off
wo
it
give
him
an
awful
shock
when
he
catches
a
glimpse
of
us
waiting
here
on
the
hilltop
asked
molly
it
a
shock
that
wo
hurt
him
replied
the
professor
we
see
what
happens
at
any
rate
he
put
his
cup
and
saucer
on
the
ground
while
his
quizzical
eyes
which
seemed
to
laugh
even
when
his
face
was
serious
turned
toward
molly
and
molly
was
well
worth
looking
at
that
afternoon
although
she
herself
was
much
dissatisfied
with
her
appearance
her
auburn
hair
had
almost
slipped
down
her
back
her
blue
linen
shirtwaist
was
decidedly
blousey
at
the
waist
line
it
because
i
have
enough
shape
to
keep
it
down
she
was
wont
to
complain
her
cheeks
were
glowing
and
her
eyes
as
calmly
blue
as
the
summer
skies
perhaps
we
better
start
on
said
nance
uneasily
she
always
felt
an
inexplicable
shyness
in
the
presence
of
men
and
her
friends
had
been
known
to
nickname
her
old
maid
but
before
professor
green
could
protest
that
he
was
only
too
glad
to
have
his
bashful
brother
make
the
acquaintance
of
three
charming
college
girls
judy
ever
on
the
alert
exclaimed
look
there
he
comes
around
the
side
of
the
hill
the
professor
rose
and
signaled
with
his
hat
chuckling
to
himself
as
he
watched
his
youthful
brother
pause
irresolutely
on
the
hillside
come
on
dodo
he
shouted
making
a
trumpet
of
his
hands
i
believe
not
this
afternoon
thank
you
dodo
trumpeted
back
i
have
an
important
engagement
at
six
the
girls
could
not
keep
from
laughing
it
a
shame
to
frighten
the
poor
soul
like
that
exclaimed
molly
we
start
back
professor
and
leave
him
in
peace
but
the
professor
was
a
man
of
determination
and
had
made
up
his
mind
to
bring
his
shy
brother
into
the
presence
of
ladies
that
afternoon
very
attractive
ladies
at
that
of
george
own
age
with
simple
unaffected
manners
calculated
to
make
a
shy
young
man
forget
for
the
moment
that
he
had
an
affliction
of
agonizing
diffidence
george
called
the
professor
running
a
little
way
down
the
hillside
come
back
and
do
be
a
fool
the
wretched
lad
turned
his
scarlet
face
in
their
direction
and
began
to
climb
the
hill
he
was
a
tall
overgrown
youth
with
large
hands
and
feet
and
when
he
stood
in
their
midst
holding
his
cap
nervously
in
both
hands
while
the
professor
performed
the
introductions
he
looked
like
a
soldier
facing
the
battle
it
remained
for
molly
and
judy
to
put
him
at
his
ease
however
with
tea
and
cookies
and
questions
about
exmoor
college
while
the
professor
conversed
with
nance
about
life
at
wellington
and
which
study
she
liked
best
at
last
the
spirit
of
george
emerged
from
its
shy
retreat
and
he
forgot
to
feel
or
afraid
they
rose
packed
the
tea
things
and
started
back
and
it
was
the
professor
who
carried
judy
tea
basket
while
george
glancing
from
molly
blue
eyes
to
judy
soft
gray
ones
strolled
between
them
and
related
a
thrilling
tale
of
college
hazing
that
was
a
swift
remedy
was
it
not
miss
oldham
observed
the
professor
laughing
under
his
breath
but
undoubtedly
the
cure
was
complete
for
that
very
evening
molly
received
a
note
written
in
a
crabbed
boyish
hand
and
signed
george
green
inviting
the
three
girls
to
ride
over
to
exmoor
on
the
trolley
the
following
saturday
and
spend
the
day
miss
green
an
older
sister
would
act
as
chaperone
and
not
a
few
thrills
did
these
young
ladies
experience
at
the
prospect
chapter
ix
rumors
and
mysteries
how
many
impetuous
people
get
themselves
into
holes
because
of
those
two
qualities
which
are
very
closely
allied
indeed
and
molly
brown
was
one
of
those
people
carried
away
by
emotions
of
generosity
she
found
herself
constantly
going
farther
than
she
realized
at
the
moment
why
for
instance
could
she
not
have
put
frances
andrews
off
with
an
excuse
for
a
day
or
so
some
one
would
surely
have
asked
her
to
the
ball
and
if
she
had
only
liked
frances
matters
would
have
been
different
if
it
had
been
an
act
of
friendship
of
deep
devotion
but
in
spite
of
herself
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
trust
that
strange
girl
beautiful
and
clever
as
she
undoubtedly
was
and
sorry
as
molly
was
for
her
after
all
it
was
rather
selfish
of
frances
to
have
obtained
the
promise
from
molly
did
she
think
it
would
reinstate
her
in
the
affections
of
her
class
to
be
seen
in
the
company
of
the
popular
young
freshman
all
this
time
molly
said
nothing
to
her
friends
but
on
the
morning
of
the
ball
she
could
not
conceal
from
judy
and
nance
her
apprehension
and
general
depression
and
seeing
their
friend
eye
and
drooping
countenance
they
held
a
counsel
of
war
in
judy
small
bedroom
at
the
end
of
this
whispered
conference
judy
was
heard
to
remark
i
afraid
of
the
girl
to
tell
you
the
truth
her
fiery
eyes
and
her
tongue
seem
to
take
all
the
spirit
out
of
me
i
not
afraid
of
her
said
nance
who
had
a
tongue
of
her
own
once
she
was
stirred
into
action
you
wait
here
for
me
and
when
i
come
back
you
can
go
and
notify
the
sophomores
of
what
happened
of
course
molly
will
get
to
the
ball
all
right
the
thing
is
to
extricate
her
from
the
situation
by
the
most
tactful
and
surest
means
judy
laughed
no
she
answered
the
thing
is
not
to
let
molly
know
we
have
saved
her
life
if
frances
had
done
that
witch
stunt
and
said
all
those
malicious
things
at
molly
kentucky
spread
i
do
think
i
should
have
minded
so
much
and
do
you
know
judy
that
the
report
has
spread
abroad
that
she
and
molly
had
prepared
the
whole
thing
beforehand
speeches
and
all
and
were
in
league
together
you
see
molly
was
the
only
one
who
hit
you
do
mean
it
cried
judy
then
more
than
ever
i
want
to
spare
the
child
the
humiliation
she
might
have
to
suffer
if
she
went
with
frances
go
forth
to
battle
nance
and
may
the
saints
preserve
you
nance
girded
her
sweater
about
her
like
a
coat
of
mail
stiffened
her
backbone
pressed
her
lips
together
and
marched
out
to
the
fray
she
never
told
even
judy
exactly
what
took
place
between
frances
and
her
in
that
small
room
with
its
bewildering
array
of
fine
trappings
silver
combs
and
brushes
yellow
silk
curtains
at
the
window
turkish
rugs
books
and
pictures
no
one
had
ever
seen
the
room
except
molly
the
night
of
the
spread
when
it
was
too
dark
to
make
out
what
was
in
it
there
was
no
loud
talking
whatever
was
said
was
of
the
tense
quiet
kind
and
presently
nance
emerged
unscathed
from
the
encounter
she
made
me
give
my
word
of
honor
not
to
tell
what
was
said
she
announced
to
the
palpitating
judy
but
she
writing
the
note
to
molly
now
so
go
quickly
and
inform
someone
that
molly
has
no
escort
for
the
ball
judy
departed
much
mystified
and
nance
remained
discreetly
away
from
her
own
room
until
she
perceived
frances
steal
down
the
hall
push
a
note
under
their
door
and
then
hurry
back
bang
her
own
door
and
lock
it
then
after
a
moment
grace
nance
marched
boldly
to
their
chamber
molly
was
reading
the
note
what
do
you
think
nance
she
exclaimed
with
a
tone
of
evident
relief
in
her
voice
frances
andrews
ca
go
indeed
and
what
reason
does
she
give
asked
nance
feeling
very
much
like
a
conspirator
now
that
she
was
obliged
to
face
molly
none
she
simply
says
sorry
i
ca
go
hope
you
enjoy
it
f
a
how
does
she
expect
me
to
get
there
i
wonder
at
the
eleventh
hour
nance
examined
her
finger
nails
attentively
perhaps
she
seen
to
that
she
replied
after
a
pause
nance
said
molly
presently
i
so
relieved
that
i
think
i
have
to
up
it
mean
of
me
i
know
and
i
feel
awfully
ungenerous
to
be
so
glad
you
see
nobody
can
ever
tell
what
strange
freakish
thing
she
going
to
do
of
course
she
was
the
witch
i
knew
it
from
the
conscious
look
that
came
into
her
face
when
i
told
her
about
it
afterwards
the
mistake
she
has
made
is
being
defiant
instead
of
repentant
said
nance
instead
of
trying
to
brazen
it
out
she
ought
to
softly
as
the
bible
says
and
keep
quiet
she
is
the
most
embittered
soul
i
ever
met
in
all
my
life
if
hatred
counted
for
much
her
hatred
for
her
own
class
would
burn
it
to
a
cinder
there
was
a
sound
of
hurrying
footsteps
on
the
stairs
and
judy
burst
into
the
room
her
face
was
aflame
and
she
flung
herself
into
a
chair
panting
for
breath
what
your
hurry
asked
molly
slipping
on
her
jacket
excuse
me
i
must
be
chasing
along
to
french
tell
her
the
news
nance
no
need
to
tell
judy
news
who
had
news
of
her
own
i
tell
you
nance
she
exclaimed
there
are
times
when
i
think
the
position
of
a
freshman
is
one
of
the
lowliest
things
in
life
the
first
sophomore
i
met
was
judith
blount
i
did
feel
a
little
timid
but
i
told
her
what
had
happened
can
tell
your
friend
she
said
we
sophomores
are
not
so
gullible
as
all
that
and
if
her
nerve
has
failed
her
at
the
last
moment
it
her
fault
not
ours
why
judy
exclaimed
nance
you
did
know
you
were
jumping
from
the
frying
pan
right
into
the
fire
when
you
told
that
to
judith
blount
who
has
never
liked
molly
from
the
beginning
it
jealousy
pure
and
simple
i
think
although
there
almost
seems
to
be
something
more
behind
it
sometimes
she
takes
such
pains
to
be
disagreeable
was
anyone
else
there
to
hear
you
oh
yes
she
was
surrounded
by
her
satellites
jennie
wren
and
a
few
others
the
two
girls
sat
in
gloomy
silence
for
a
few
minutes
after
that
rebuff
they
hardly
cared
to
circulate
the
bit
of
news
any
further
in
the
sophomore
class
which
it
must
be
confessed
had
the
reputation
of
being
run
by
a
clique
of
the
most
arrogant
and
snobbish
set
of
girls
wellington
college
had
ever
known
let
go
and
tell
our
woes
to
nice
old
sally
marks
suggested
judy
and
off
they
marched
in
search
of
the
funny
sally
whose
room
was
on
the
floor
below
come
in
she
called
at
their
tap
on
the
door
and
noticing
at
once
their
serious
faces
she
exclaimed
i
declare
i
am
beginning
to
feel
like
the
oracle
at
delphi
what
the
trouble
now
my
children
you
ought
never
to
have
gone
to
judith
blount
she
continued
after
they
had
unburdened
their
secrets
but
having
gone
to
her
it
would
be
well
so
spake
the
oracle
to
sit
back
and
hold
tight
the
news
is
certain
to
spread
and
of
course
only
judith
and
her
ring
would
believe
that
molly
sent
you
out
to
find
her
an
escort
there
is
one
thing
sure
molly
is
obliged
to
go
to
the
dance
not
only
because
she
has
so
many
friends
but
because
she
figures
i
am
told
so
largely
in
croaks
and
it
would
be
sport
spoiled
if
she
was
there
when
the
things
are
read
out
now
trot
along
children
i
cramming
for
an
and
i
busier
than
the
busiest
person
in
wellington
the
afternoon
dragged
itself
slowly
along
nance
took
her
best
dress
out
of
its
wrappings
heated
a
little
iron
and
smoothed
out
its
wrinkles
she
lifted
molly
blue
crepe
from
its
hanger
and
laid
it
on
the
couch
it
was
made
in
the
simplest
possible
way
out
of
the
least
possible
goods
in
the
least
possible
time
she
informed
judy
who
had
wickedly
cut
a
class
and
sat
moping
in
her
friend
room
is
it
pretty
we
made
it
together
and
i
really
quite
puffed
up
about
the
result
empire
you
know
she
added
proudly
the
dress
did
indeed
show
the
short
empire
waist
the
round
neck
was
cut
out
and
finished
with
a
frill
of
creamy
lace
which
molly
happened
to
have
and
there
had
not
been
much
of
a
struggle
with
the
sleeves
which
came
only
to
the
elbow
and
were
to
all
intents
and
purposes
shapeless
but
the
color
was
the
thing
as
molly
had
said
i
be
willing
to
drown
in
a
color
like
that
judy
observed
judy
was
quite
a
about
colors
and
assured
her
friends
that
she
could
never
wear
red
because
it
inflamed
her
temper
and
made
her
cross
that
violet
quieted
her
nerves
green
stirred
her
ambitions
and
blue
aroused
her
sympathies
while
they
were
looking
at
the
dress
margaret
wakefield
and
jessie
lynch
her
roommate
and
boon
companion
after
rapping
on
the
door
sailed
into
the
room
we
came
to
consult
about
clothes
they
announced
is
this
to
be
an
evening
dress
affair
or
what
proper
to
wear
the
best
you
have
replied
judy
at
least
that
what
i
was
told
by
the
oracular
sally
below
stairs
for
the
love
of
heaven
do
tell
that
to
jessie
cried
margaret
if
you
give
her
so
much
rope
she
be
wearing
purple
velvet
and
cloth
of
gold
jessie
laughed
she
was
already
considered
the
best
dressed
and
prettiest
girl
in
the
freshman
class
and
it
was
a
joke
at
queen
cottage
that
she
had
been
obliged
to
apply
to
the
matron
for
more
closet
room
because
the
large
one
she
shared
with
margaret
wakefield
was
not
nearly
adequate
for
her
numerous
frocks
it
had
been
a
constant
wonder
to
the
other
girls
in
the
house
that
these
two
opposite
types
could
have
become
such
intimate
friends
but
friends
they
were
and
continued
to
be
throughout
their
college
course
although
jessie
never
could
rake
up
an
interest
in
the
constitution
or
suffrage
either
the
two
girls
really
formed
a
sort
of
combination
of
brains
and
beauty
and
it
became
generally
known
that
jessie
would
hardly
have
pulled
through
the
four
years
except
for
the
indefatigable
efforts
of
her
faithful
friend
margaret
mabel
hinton
a
queen
cottage
freshman
now
popped
her
head
in
at
the
door
which
was
half
open
she
was
a
very
odd
character
but
she
was
popular
with
her
friends
who
called
her
the
martian
probably
because
she
had
a
phenomenal
intellect
and
wore
enormous
glasses
in
tortoise
shell
frames
which
made
her
eyes
look
like
a
pair
of
full
moons
i
thought
i
heard
a
racket
she
said
in
her
crisp
catchy
voice
i
suppose
you
are
all
discussing
the
news
news
what
news
they
demanded
she
closed
the
door
carefully
and
came
farther
into
the
room
gather
around
me
girls
she
said
mysteriously
enjoying
their
curiosity
but
what
is
it
mabel
do
keep
us
in
suspense
cried
judy
always
impatient
well
there
is
evidence
that
someone
was
going
to
set
fire
to
the
gym
she
began
in
a
whisper
this
morning
a
bundle
of
rags
was
discovered
in
a
closet
and
then
they
began
to
search
and
found
several
other
bundles
like
the
first
there
was
a
lot
of
excitement
and
the
prex
came
over
they
tried
to
keep
it
quiet
but
the
story
leaked
out
of
course
and
is
still
leaking
she
smiled
the
girls
exchanged
horrified
glances
what
terrible
disaster
might
not
have
befallen
them
if
the
rags
had
not
been
discovered
of
course
it
was
the
work
of
an
insane
person
said
margaret
wakefield
of
course
but
who
is
she
one
of
the
students
or
some
outside
person
with
a
common
instinct
judy
and
nance
looked
up
at
the
same
moment
their
glances
met
without
making
a
sound
judy
lips
formed
the
word
frances
is
the
dance
to
take
place
then
asked
jessie
oh
yes
it
all
been
hushed
up
and
things
will
go
on
just
as
usual
i
going
to
look
on
from
the
balcony
i
sha
mingle
with
the
dancers
because
they
knock
off
my
spectacles
and
generally
upset
my
equilibrium
the
door
opened
and
molly
appeared
in
their
midst
like
a
gracefully
angular
wraith
for
her
face
looked
white
her
shoulders
drooped
and
her
long
slim
arms
hung
down
at
her
sides
dejectedly
why
molly
dear
has
anything
happened
to
you
cried
nance
no
i
wo
say
that
nothing
has
happened
answered
molly
sinking
into
a
chair
and
resting
her
chin
on
her
hand
i
have
been
put
through
an
ordeal
this
day
why
i
can
never
tell
you
but
i
am
glad
you
are
all
here
so
that
i
can
tell
you
about
it
they
pressed
about
her
full
of
sympathy
and
friendliness
while
judy
who
loved
comfort
and
recognized
the
needs
of
the
flesh
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
lit
nance
alcohol
lamp
and
put
on
the
kettle
to
make
tea
but
what
is
it
they
all
demanded
seeing
that
molly
had
fallen
into
a
silence
i
been
with
the
president
for
the
last
hour
she
said
though
for
what
reason
i
ca
explain
i
ca
imagine
why
i
was
sent
for
and
brought
to
her
private
office
she
was
very
nice
and
kind
she
asked
me
a
lot
of
questions
about
myself
and
all
of
queen
girls
i
was
glad
enough
to
answer
them
because
we
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
have
we
girls
molly
rose
and
stood
before
them
spreading
out
her
hands
with
a
kind
of
deprecating
gesture
the
circle
of
faces
before
her
almost
seemed
abashed
under
the
steady
gaze
of
her
clear
blue
eyes
it
was
a
pleasure
to
tell
her
what
nice
girls
were
stopping
at
cottage
did
she
mention
began
judy
and
pointed
to
the
dividing
wall
of
the
next
room
oh
yes
i
was
coming
to
that
but
what
do
i
know
about
mollie
stopped
short
and
caught
her
breath
her
eyes
turned
towards
the
door
which
was
opened
softly
there
stood
frances
andrews
she
had
evidently
just
come
in
for
she
still
wore
her
sweater
and
tam
o
shanter
and
brought
with
her
the
smell
of
the
fresh
piney
air
it
all
right
about
your
escort
for
miss
brown
you
are
to
go
with
miss
stewart
who
has
got
special
privilege
from
the
sophomore
president
to
take
you
i
hope
you
have
a
ripping
time
i
sha
see
you
at
supper
i
going
off
on
the
train
and
wo
be
back
until
sunday
night
there
was
such
a
tense
feeling
in
the
circle
of
freshmen
as
frances
stood
there
that
as
judy
remarked
afterwards
they
almost
crackled
with
electricity
it
was
quite
late
and
as
most
of
the
girls
intended
to
dress
for
the
party
before
supper
they
took
their
departure
immediately
without
any
comment
is
anything
special
the
matter
asked
molly
after
they
had
gone
and
she
was
left
alone
with
her
friends
they
told
her
the
strange
story
which
mabel
hinton
had
reported
to
them
a
little
while
before
but
that
is
the
work
of
a
lunatic
exclaimed
molly
horrified
and
i
suppose
went
on
nance
that
the
reason
prexy
sent
for
you
was
that
she
suspected
a
certain
person
who
shall
be
nameless
and
she
was
told
that
you
were
the
only
person
who
had
ever
been
nice
to
her
and
furthermore
that
you
were
going
to
the
dance
with
her
of
course
that
must
be
the
reason
said
molly
and
of
course
absurd
i
mean
suspecting
frances
andrews
she
might
be
accused
of
many
things
but
she
is
certainly
in
her
right
mind
she
much
cleverer
than
lots
of
the
girls
in
her
class
clever
yes
but
should
you
call
her
balanced
molly
did
not
answer
she
felt
anxious
and
frightened
and
a
rap
on
the
door
at
that
moment
made
her
jump
with
nervousness
it
proved
to
be
one
of
the
maids
of
the
house
with
two
boxes
of
flowers
both
for
molly
one
was
pink
roses
and
contained
the
card
of
mary
stewart
and
the
other
was
violets
and
contained
no
card
whatever
she
divided
the
violets
in
half
and
made
her
two
friends
wear
them
that
night
to
the
dance
chapter
x
jokes
and
croaks
i
beginning
to
feel
that
we
shall
issue
happily
out
of
all
our
troubles
cried
judy
kean
bursting
into
her
friends
room
without
knocking
and
the
reason
why
i
feel
that
way
is
because
when
i
am
clothed
in
silk
attire
my
soul
is
clothed
in
joy
especially
when
there
dancing
to
follow
button
me
up
someone
please
so
that
i
may
take
a
good
look
at
my
resplendent
form
in
your
mirror
i
ca
see
more
than
a
square
inch
of
neck
in
my
own
two
by
four
the
girls
stood
back
to
admire
their
friend
who
indulged
her
artistic
fancy
in
rather
theatrical
clothes
much
too
old
for
her
but
who
usually
succeeded
in
gaining
the
effect
she
sought
dear
me
walks
in
beauty
like
the
night
said
molly
laughing
you
look
like
a
charming
and
very
youthful
judy
but
how
comes
it
you
are
wearing
black
black
is
for
certain
types
replied
judy
sagely
and
i
am
one
of
them
next
to
black
my
bilious
skin
takes
on
a
dazzling
creamy
tint
and
my
hair
assumes
a
yellow
glint
that
is
not
its
own
the
girls
laughed
at
their
erratic
friend
who
was
indeed
dressed
in
black
chiffon
from
the
fluffy
folds
of
which
her
vivacious
young
face
glowed
like
a
flower
if
you
object
to
me
wait
until
you
see
jessie
cried
judy
she
might
be
going
to
the
opera
she
is
so
fine
she
is
wearing
pink
satin
that
glistens
all
over
like
a
christmas
tree
with
little
shiny
things
as
a
matter
of
fact
nance
whose
well
balanced
and
correct
tastes
in
most
things
rarely
failed
her
was
the
most
suitably
dressed
of
our
girls
in
her
pretty
white
lingerie
frock
at
eight
that
evening
molly
rolled
away
luxuriously
in
a
village
hack
with
mary
stewart
holding
her
roses
tenderly
and
carefully
under
her
gray
eiderdown
cape
so
as
not
to
crush
them
i
awfully
glad
i
was
so
lucky
as
to
draw
you
this
evening
molly
the
older
girl
was
saying
i
the
lucky
one
answered
molly
her
thoughts
reverting
to
the
strange
discovery
of
the
morning
oh
miss
stewart
what
did
frances
andrews
do
last
year
to
get
herself
into
such
a
mess
and
be
frozen
out
by
all
her
class
this
year
i
tell
you
perhaps
some
day
but
not
we
want
to
enjoy
ourselves
can
you
guide
molly
like
a
streak
i
always
guided
at
home
at
the
school
dances
because
i
was
the
tallest
girl
in
my
class
i
a
guider
too
laughed
mary
and
when
two
guiders
come
together
i
imagine
it
a
good
deal
like
a
tug
of
war
during
the
ride
over
to
the
gymnasium
neither
of
the
girls
mentioned
the
thing
uppermost
in
their
minds
the
attempt
to
set
the
gymnasium
on
fire
that
night
nor
was
the
rumor
referred
to
by
anyone
at
the
dance
later
it
was
a
strictly
forbidden
topic
the
president
herself
having
issued
orders
the
great
room
was
a
mass
of
foliage
and
bunting
japanese
lanterns
and
incandescent
lights
in
many
colors
and
it
was
really
quite
a
brilliant
affair
according
to
molly
notions
who
had
never
seen
anything
but
small
country
dances
usually
given
at
the
schoolhouse
several
miles
from
her
home
lovely
music
floated
from
behind
a
screen
of
palms
and
lovely
girls
floated
on
the
floor
in
couples
to
the
strains
of
the
latest
waltz
i
afraid
i
going
to
be
an
awful
wallflower
thought
molly
feeling
suddenly
overgrown
and
awkward
in
the
midst
of
this
swirling
mass
of
grace
and
beauty
i
ca
help
feeling
queer
and
i
do
seem
to
recognize
anybody
but
molly
had
plenty
of
partners
that
evening
and
after
that
first
delightful
waltz
it
was
nearly
an
hour
before
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
mary
stewart
again
in
the
crowd
of
dancers
is
it
jolly
called
judy
as
they
dashed
past
each
other
in
a
romping
barn
dance
i
never
thought
i
could
have
such
a
good
time
at
a
manless
party
jessie
lynch
confided
to
molly
while
they
rested
against
the
wall
later
but
really
it
quite
as
good
fun
is
it
replied
molly
i
think
i
never
had
a
better
time
in
my
life
but
i
afraid
our
roommates
and
friends
are
not
enjoying
it
very
much
she
added
ruefully
pointing
to
the
gallery
where
seated
in
a
silent
bored
row
were
margaret
wakefield
nance
oldham
and
mabel
hinton
of
course
said
jessie
you
would
never
expect
mabel
to
join
this
mad
throng
but
i
surprised
at
nance
and
margaret
margaret
prefers
conversation
parties
i
suppose
and
nance
is
not
fond
of
dancing
either
she
would
always
rather
look
on
she
says
the
two
girls
were
standing
near
the
musicians
and
from
the
other
side
of
the
screen
of
palms
they
now
heard
a
voice
say
have
you
danced
with
the
fantastic
empress
josephine
as
yet
not
as
yet
came
the
answer
with
a
laugh
but
be
careful
she
is
near
molly
moved
away
hastily
her
face
crimson
jessie
had
heard
the
question
also
and
recognized
the
voice
of
judith
blount
why
molly
she
exclaimed
glancing
at
her
face
you
do
think
they
meant
yes
said
molly
trying
to
smile
naturally
i
do
she
glanced
down
at
her
dress
perhaps
it
did
look
amateurish
she
and
nance
had
worked
very
hard
over
it
but
after
all
they
were
not
experienced
dressmakers
why
you
look
perfectly
charming
went
on
jessie
generously
the
color
is
exactly
right
for
you
yes
color
answered
molly
but
there
ought
to
be
something
besides
color
to
a
dress
you
know
never
mind
i
should
be
such
a
sensitive
plant
jessie
one
ought
not
to
mind
being
called
fantastic
it
not
nearly
so
bad
as
being
called
well
malicious
cruel
i
rather
be
fantastic
than
any
of
those
things
but
i
did
think
the
dress
was
pretty
when
we
made
it
come
along
and
let
get
some
lemonade
molly
your
dress
is
sweet
and
suits
you
exactly
so
there
then
someone
came
up
and
claimed
jessie
for
the
next
dance
but
molly
was
grateful
to
the
pretty
butterfly
creature
for
her
assurances
and
she
resolved
to
forget
all
about
her
dress
as
she
lingered
in
the
corner
uncertain
whether
to
stay
where
she
was
or
join
her
friends
in
the
gallery
mary
stewart
made
her
way
through
the
crowd
and
called
oh
here
you
are
some
of
the
seniors
are
just
outside
and
want
to
meet
you
will
you
come
i
should
think
i
would
replied
molly
joyfully
fantastic
or
not
she
had
one
good
friend
among
the
older
girls
this
is
miss
molly
brown
of
kentucky
announced
mary
stewart
presently
to
a
dozen
august
seniors
who
shook
her
hand
and
began
asking
her
questions
we
had
two
reasons
for
wanting
to
meet
you
miss
brown
here
put
in
a
very
handsome
big
girl
who
spoke
in
an
authoritative
tone
which
made
everybody
stop
and
listen
she
was
in
fact
the
president
of
the
senior
class
one
of
course
was
just
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
the
other
was
to
ask
if
you
would
do
us
a
favor
we
are
going
to
have
a
living
picture
show
friday
week
for
the
benefit
of
the
students
fund
and
we
wondered
if
you
would
pose
in
one
of
the
pictures
maybe
several
we
have
decided
on
them
yet
but
that
dress
must
be
in
one
of
them
do
you
think
so
mary
one
of
romney
lady
hamilton
pictures
for
instance
with
a
white
gauze
fichu
or
a
sir
thomas
lawrence
portrait
you
do
think
it
too
fantastic
asked
molly
what
that
lovely
blue
thing
heavens
no
it
charming
molly
had
barely
time
to
thank
her
and
accept
the
invitation
when
she
and
mary
were
dragged
off
to
make
up
the
big
circle
of
right
and
left
all
around
which
wound
up
the
dance
after
this
whirling
romp
three
loud
raps
were
heard
and
gradually
the
noise
of
talking
and
laughter
subsided
into
absolute
silence
a
girl
had
mounted
the
platform
she
carried
a
megaphone
in
one
hand
and
a
book
in
the
other
she
was
the
official
reader
of
her
class
and
now
proceeded
to
recite
through
the
megaphone
all
the
best
and
most
amusing
material
from
jokes
croaks
according
to
time
honored
custom
the
jokes
were
greeted
with
applause
and
laughter
and
the
croaks
with
groans
and
laughter
and
anybody
who
groaned
at
a
joke
or
applauded
a
croak
if
she
happened
to
be
caught
was
publicly
humiliated
by
being
made
to
stand
up
and
face
the
jeers
of
the
multitude
the
girls
finally
decided
after
many
ludicrous
mistakes
that
the
jokes
were
on
the
sophomores
and
the
croaks
were
on
the
freshmen
for
instance
here
was
a
croak
a
lady
of
notable
luck
who
cared
not
for
turkey
or
duck
cried
me
old
ham
and
i
do
give
a
slam
if
it
comes
from
vermont
or
kaintuck
this
was
greeted
with
laughing
groans
and
molly
for
the
first
time
realized
the
significance
of
her
roommate
name
margaret
wakefield
figured
in
several
croaks
as
the
suffragette
of
queen
in
fact
queen
girls
came
in
for
a
good
many
croaks
and
began
to
wait
fearfully
for
what
was
to
come
next
but
the
witticisms
were
all
quite
even
the
last
which
called
forth
so
many
merry
groans
that
they
soon
ceased
to
be
groans
at
all
and
became
uproarious
laughter
and
molly
very
red
and
laughing
too
was
the
centre
of
all
eyes
this
was
the
croak
they
have
locked
me
in
the
cloisters
they
have
fastened
up
the
gate
oh
let
me
out
oh
let
me
out
it
getting
very
late
is
said
the
ghosts
of
classes
gone
do
wander
here
at
night
oh
let
me
out
oh
let
me
out
before
i
die
of
fright
and
then
there
rang
a
clarion
voice
it
tone
was
loud
and
clear
dry
your
eyes
and
cease
your
cries
for
help
i
ween
is
near
but
promise
me
one
little
thing
before
i
ope
the
gate
oh
never
pass
the
coffee
tray
if
i
am
sitting
nigh
or
if
you
pass
the
coffee
tray
oh
then
just
pass
me
by
it
was
all
very
jolly
and
delightful
and
for
the
first
time
the
girls
felt
that
they
were
really
a
part
of
the
college
life
mary
stewart
was
very
sweet
to
molly
when
she
took
her
home
that
night
and
the
young
freshman
never
realized
until
long
afterwards
when
she
was
a
senior
herself
what
a
nice
thing
her
friend
had
done
for
receptions
were
an
old
story
to
mary
stewart
chapter
xi
exmoor
college
busy
days
followed
the
ball
the
girls
were
getting
into
line
as
judy
variously
expressed
it
showing
their
mettle
and
putting
on
steam
for
the
winter
work
the
story
of
the
incendiary
had
been
reported
exaggerated
and
had
gradually
died
out
altogether
frances
andrews
had
returned
to
college
more
brazenly
facetious
than
ever
breaking
into
conversations
loudly
interrupting
making
jokes
which
no
one
laughed
at
except
molly
and
judy
out
of
charity
she
was
a
strange
girl
and
led
a
lonely
life
but
she
was
too
much
like
the
crater
of
a
sleeping
volcano
which
might
shoot
off
unexpectedly
at
any
moment
and
most
of
the
girls
gave
her
a
wide
berth
the
weather
grew
cold
and
crisp
there
was
a
smell
of
smoke
in
the
air
from
burning
leaves
and
from
the
chimneys
of
the
faculty
homes
wherein
wood
fires
glowed
cheerfully
at
last
saturday
arrived
it
was
the
day
of
the
excursion
to
exmoor
and
it
was
with
more
or
less
anxiety
regarding
the
weather
that
the
three
girls
scanned
the
skies
that
morning
for
signs
of
rain
but
the
heavens
were
a
deep
and
cloudless
blue
and
the
air
mildly
caressing
neither
too
cold
nor
too
warm
it
is
like
the
indian
summers
we
have
at
home
exclaimed
molly
when
an
hour
later
they
turned
their
faces
toward
the
village
through
which
the
trolley
passed
mabel
hinton
passing
them
as
they
started
had
called
out
art
off
on
a
picnic
and
they
had
answered
we
art
some
other
girls
had
cried
whither
away
so
early
oh
and
they
had
cried
to
exmoor
to
exmoor
for
now
the
day
has
come
at
last
paraphrasing
a
song
judy
was
in
the
habit
of
singing
indeed
the
day
seemed
so
perfect
and
joyous
that
they
could
hardly
keep
from
singing
aloud
instead
of
just
humming
when
they
boarded
the
trolley
car
through
the
country
they
sped
swiftly
the
valley
unfolded
itself
before
them
in
all
its
beauty
and
the
misty
blue
hills
in
the
distance
seemed
to
draw
nearer
over
everything
there
was
a
sense
of
autumn
peace
which
comes
when
the
world
is
drowsing
off
into
his
deep
sleep
exmoor
called
the
conductor
at
last
and
the
three
girls
stepped
off
at
a
charming
rustic
station
with
a
clang
of
the
bell
which
rang
out
harshly
in
the
still
air
the
car
flew
on
the
three
girls
looked
at
the
empty
station
then
they
looked
at
each
other
with
a
kind
of
mock
consternation
for
nothing
really
mattered
where
is
dodo
asked
judy
with
the
smile
of
the
victor
since
she
had
predicted
only
a
few
moments
before
that
dodo
might
by
this
time
have
become
so
frightened
at
his
boldness
that
he
would
suddenly
become
extinct
like
his
namesake
the
well
if
dodo
is
really
extinct
said
molly
we
just
take
a
little
walk
back
through
the
fields
epim√©nides
thought
nothing
of
it
he
expects
to
walk
and
meet
us
at
lunch
but
dodo
was
not
extinct
that
morning
and
they
beheld
him
now
running
down
the
steep
road
as
fast
as
his
heavy
boots
could
carry
him
behold
his
spirit
has
risen
from
its
fossil
remains
and
he
now
walks
among
us
in
the
guise
of
a
man
chanted
judy
do
make
us
laugh
judy
just
as
the
poor
soul
arrives
without
enough
breath
to
apologize
said
nance
and
the
next
instant
the
embarrassed
young
man
stood
before
them
blushing
and
stammering
as
if
he
had
been
caught
in
the
act
of
picking
a
pocket
or
committing
some
other
slight
crime
which
required
explanation
i
terribly
sorry
have
you
waited
long
the
schedule
was
changed
i
did
know
you
should
have
come
half
an
hour
later
i
do
mean
that
i
mean
i
was
ready
he
broke
off
in
an
agony
of
embarrassment
and
the
girls
burst
out
laughing
do
you
be
caring
said
judy
we
here
and
nothing
else
really
matters
i
should
have
thought
the
station
of
a
man
college
could
be
so
deserted
observed
molly
looking
about
the
empty
place
dodo
assured
her
that
plenty
of
people
would
be
there
in
half
an
hour
when
the
train
arrived
just
then
everybody
was
either
in
the
village
on
the
other
side
of
the
buildings
or
down
on
the
football
grounds
watching
the
morning
practice
game
there
was
to
be
a
real
game
that
afternoon
you
see
it
only
a
small
college
he
went
on
there
are
only
two
hundred
and
fifty
in
all
the
standards
are
so
high
it
rather
hard
to
get
in
but
we
are
heavily
endowed
and
can
afford
to
keep
up
the
standards
he
added
proudly
they
climbed
the
road
to
the
college
almost
in
silence
and
in
ten
minutes
emerged
on
a
level
elevation
or
table
land
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
entire
countryside
here
stood
the
college
buildings
built
of
red
brick
seasoned
and
mellowed
with
time
they
were
a
beautiful
and
dignified
group
of
buildings
and
there
was
a
decidedly
old
world
atmosphere
about
the
place
and
the
campus
with
splendid
elm
trees
molly
had
once
heard
judith
blount
refer
to
exmoor
as
that
little
college
and
she
was
not
prepared
for
anything
so
fine
and
impressive
as
this
nor
was
she
prepared
for
the
surprise
of
miss
green
sister
of
professor
edwin
and
dodo
the
girls
had
pictured
her
a
spinster
having
heard
she
was
older
than
the
professor
himself
who
seemed
a
thousand
to
them
and
here
waiting
for
them
in
the
living
room
of
the
chapter
house
was
a
very
charming
and
girlish
young
woman
with
brown
eyes
and
cleft
chin
and
george
blonde
hair
the
ease
and
graciousness
of
one
brother
and
the
youthful
fairness
of
the
other
she
had
come
down
from
new
york
the
night
before
especially
to
meet
them
she
said
rather
an
expensive
trip
they
thought
for
one
day
pleasure
since
it
took
about
seven
hours
and
meant
usually
one
meal
and
of
course
at
night
a
berth
on
the
sleeper
at
first
i
thought
i
could
manage
it
for
this
week
she
continued
but
edwin
was
so
insistent
and
no
one
has
ever
been
known
to
refuse
him
anything
he
really
wanted
edwin
but
why
edwin
why
not
the
youthful
and
blushing
dodo
so
molly
wondered
while
they
were
conducted
over
the
entire
college
the
beautiful
little
gothic
chapel
with
its
stained
glass
windows
through
the
splendid
old
library
which
was
much
smaller
than
the
one
at
wellington
but
much
more
atmospheric
as
judy
had
remarked
then
through
the
dormitories
where
they
remained
discreetly
in
the
corridors
and
finally
back
to
the
chapter
house
in
which
george
lodged
with
some
thirty
schoolmates
there
on
the
piazza
was
professor
edwin
green
waiting
for
them
he
had
made
an
early
start
he
said
and
walked
the
whole
distance
in
less
than
three
hours
some
other
young
men
came
up
and
were
introduced
and
the
entire
gay
party
nance
shyly
sticking
closely
beside
miss
green
went
off
to
view
the
village
which
was
a
quaint
old
place
well
worth
visiting
they
were
told
the
train
had
evidently
come
in
and
crowds
of
people
were
hurrying
up
the
road
there
was
a
sound
of
a
horn
and
a
coach
dashed
in
sight
filled
with
students
wearing
crimson
streamers
in
their
buttonholes
it
a
crowd
of
repton
fellows
come
over
to
see
their
team
licked
george
explained
but
look
edwin
here
comes
dickie
blount
i
thought
he
was
in
chicago
evidently
he
is
said
the
professor
his
eyes
smiling
his
mouth
serious
it
was
richard
blount
the
hero
of
the
ham
bone
and
he
straightway
attached
himself
to
molly
and
declined
to
leave
her
side
for
the
rest
of
the
day
do
tell
me
that
that
delightful
joking
jolly
person
is
brother
to
judith
whispered
judy
in
molly
ear
molly
nodded
there
no
family
resemblance
but
it
true
nevertheless
motor
cars
and
carriages
of
all
varieties
now
began
to
arrive
the
whole
countryside
had
turned
out
to
see
the
great
game
between
the
two
local
college
teams
and
the
wellington
girls
pinned
green
rosettes
in
their
buttonholes
to
signify
that
their
sympathies
were
all
for
exmoor
it
the
most
exciting
jolliest
time
i
ever
had
in
all
my
life
cried
molly
to
professor
green
who
walked
on
her
other
side
and
to
think
i
have
never
seen
a
football
game
before
in
all
my
life
i
must
draw
a
diagram
for
you
and
show
you
what
some
of
the
plays
are
or
you
will
be
in
a
muddle
said
the
professor
looking
at
her
gravely
almost
as
molly
thought
as
if
she
were
one
of
his
english
literature
pupils
at
lunch
according
to
the
etiquette
of
the
place
george
and
his
guests
were
placed
at
the
senior
table
there
was
no
smoking
nor
loud
talking
and
the
students
behaved
themselves
most
decorously
although
george
confided
to
judy
that
ordinarily
pandemonium
prevailed
after
lunch
they
started
for
the
grounds
in
a
triumphal
procession
for
our
wellington
freshmen
and
their
chaperone
had
an
escort
of
at
least
four
or
five
young
men
apiece
nance
looked
bewildered
and
shy
and
happy
judy
was
never
more
sparkling
nor
prettier
and
molly
was
in
her
gayest
brightest
humor
they
had
hardly
left
the
chapter
house
behind
them
and
proceeded
in
a
procession
across
the
campus
when
a
black
and
prancing
though
rather
bony
steed
dashed
up
bearing
a
young
lady
in
a
faultlessly
fitting
riding
habit
it
was
judith
blount
nobody
looked
particularly
thrilled
at
judith
appearance
not
even
judith
brother
and
judy
almost
exclaimed
out
loud
bother
why
could
she
stay
at
home
just
once
how
do
you
do
cousin
grace
called
judith
from
her
perch
i
heard
you
were
going
to
be
down
and
i
could
resist
riding
over
to
see
you
how
are
you
judith
i
so
glad
to
see
you
answered
cousin
grace
in
a
tone
without
much
heart
to
it
why
did
you
come
sooner
we
just
finished
lunch
thanks
i
had
a
sandwich
early
i
suppose
you
are
off
for
the
grounds
go
ahead
i
get
cousin
edwin
to
help
me
tie
up
this
old
animal
somewhere
we
follow
right
behind
molly
was
almost
certain
that
cousin
edwin
was
about
to
place
this
office
on
the
shoulders
of
his
younger
brother
but
glancing
again
at
the
flushed
and
happy
face
of
dodo
at
the
side
of
judy
the
professor
relented
and
dropped
behind
to
look
after
his
relation
never
had
molly
been
so
wildly
excited
as
she
was
over
the
football
game
that
afternoon
it
was
a
wonderful
picture
the
two
teams
lined
up
against
each
other
crowds
of
people
yelling
themselves
hoarse
the
battle
cry
of
the
repton
team
mingling
with
the
warlike
cry
of
the
exmoor
students
the
cheer
leaders
at
the
heads
of
the
cheer
sections
made
the
welkin
ring
continuously
at
last
a
young
man
who
seemed
to
be
a
giant
in
size
and
strength
dashed
like
a
wild
horse
across
the
russian
steppes
straight
up
the
field
with
the
ball
under
his
arm
and
from
the
insane
behavior
of
the
green
men
including
professor
edwin
green
and
his
fair
sister
molly
became
suddenly
aware
that
the
game
was
over
and
exmoor
had
won
the
cheering
section
could
yell
no
more
because
to
a
man
it
had
lost
its
voice
but
oh
the
glad
burst
of
song
from
the
exmoor
students
as
they
leaped
into
the
field
and
bore
the
conquering
giant
around
on
their
shoulders
and
oh
the
dejection
of
the
men
of
crimson
as
they
stalked
sadly
from
the
scene
of
their
humiliation
at
last
the
whole
glorious
day
was
over
and
the
girls
found
themselves
on
the
way
to
the
trolley
station
richard
blount
and
his
cousin
miss
green
had
hastened
on
ahead
they
were
to
take
the
six
train
back
to
new
york
cousin
edwin
why
ca
you
hire
a
horse
in
the
village
and
ride
back
to
wellington
with
me
asked
judith
when
they
paused
at
the
chapter
house
for
her
to
mount
her
black
steed
because
i
engaged
to
take
these
young
ladies
home
by
trolley
judith
answered
the
professor
firmly
judith
leaped
on
her
horse
without
assistance
gave
the
poor
animal
a
savage
lash
with
her
whip
and
dashed
across
the
campus
without
another
word
the
ride
back
at
sunset
was
even
more
perfect
than
the
morning
trip
the
professor
of
english
literature
appeared
to
have
been
temporarily
changed
into
a
boy
he
told
them
funny
stories
and
bits
of
his
own
college
experiences
and
made
them
talk
too
almost
before
they
knew
it
the
conductor
was
calling
wellington
chapter
xii
sunday
morning
breakfast
it
was
quite
the
custom
at
wellington
for
girls
to
prepare
breakfasts
on
sunday
morning
in
their
rooms
there
was
always
the
useful
boneless
chicken
to
be
creamed
in
one
chafing
dish
and
in
another
eggs
to
be
scrambled
with
a
lick
and
a
promise
at
these
impromptu
affairs
and
it
was
a
change
from
the
usual
codfish
balls
of
the
sunday
house
breakfast
illustration
it
was
quite
the
custom
for
girls
to
prepare
breakfast
in
their
on
this
particular
sunday
morning
judy
was
very
busy
for
the
breakfast
party
was
of
her
giving
in
molly
and
nance
room
her
own
singleton
being
too
small
she
was
also
very
angry
in
her
tempestuous
and
unrestrained
way
and
having
emptied
the
vials
of
her
wrath
on
molly
head
she
was
angrier
with
herself
for
giving
away
to
temper
although
it
was
judy
party
molly
as
usual
and
grandly
hospitable
had
invited
frances
andrews
then
she
had
gone
and
confessed
her
sins
to
judy
who
flared
up
and
said
things
she
intended
and
molly
had
wept
a
little
and
owned
that
she
was
entirely
at
fault
but
what
could
be
done
frances
was
invited
and
had
accepted
to
atone
for
her
sins
poor
molly
had
made
popovers
as
a
surprise
and
arranged
to
bake
them
in
murphy
oven
but
the
hostess
being
gloomy
the
company
was
gloomy
since
the
one
is
apt
to
reflect
the
humor
of
the
other
however
as
the
coffee
began
to
send
forth
its
cheerful
aroma
from
judy
russian
samovar
discord
took
wings
and
harmony
reigned
it
was
a
very
comfortable
and
sociable
party
most
of
the
girls
wore
their
kimonos
it
being
a
time
for
rest
and
relaxation
but
when
frances
andrews
swept
into
the
room
in
a
long
lavender
silk
trimmed
with
frills
of
lace
all
cotton
crepe
japanese
dressing
gowns
faded
into
insignificance
there
is
no
doubt
that
college
girls
are
a
hungry
lot
remarked
margaret
wakefield
settling
herself
comfortably
to
dispose
of
food
and
conversation
and
arouse
argument
a
thing
she
deeply
enjoyed
so
much
brain
work
requires
nourishment
observed
mabel
hinton
there
is
not
much
brain
nourishment
at
queen
put
in
frances
andrews
i
been
living
on
raw
eggs
and
sweet
chocolate
for
the
last
week
the
table
has
run
down
frightfully
sallie
marks
was
a
loyal
queen
girl
and
resented
this
slur
on
the
table
of
the
establishment
which
was
sheltering
her
now
for
the
third
year
the
food
here
is
quite
as
good
as
it
is
at
any
of
the
other
houses
she
said
coldly
to
the
unfortunate
frances
who
really
had
not
intended
to
give
offence
pardon
me
but
i
do
agree
with
you
replied
frances
and
i
have
a
right
to
my
own
opinion
i
suppose
judy
gave
molly
a
triumphant
glance
as
much
as
to
say
you
see
what
you
have
done
everybody
looked
a
little
uncomfortable
and
margaret
wakefield
equal
to
every
occasion
launched
into
a
learned
discussion
on
how
many
ounces
of
food
the
normal
person
requires
a
day
once
more
the
talk
flowed
on
smoothly
but
where
frances
was
it
would
seem
there
were
always
hidden
reefs
which
wrecked
every
subject
no
matter
how
innocent
the
moment
it
was
launched
molly
i
can
trade
compliments
with
you
put
in
jessie
lynch
taking
not
the
slightest
notice
of
her
roommate
discourse
it
one
of
those
very
indirect
compliments
but
you
be
amused
by
it
really
said
molly
do
tell
me
what
it
is
before
i
burst
with
curiosity
i
said
laughed
jessie
who
liked
a
compliment
herself
extremely
oh
of
course
replied
molly
i
have
any
number
i
can
give
you
in
exchange
how
do
you
care
for
this
one
mary
stewart
thinks
you
are
very
attractive
does
she
really
that
nice
of
her
exclaimed
jessie
blushing
with
pleasure
as
if
she
had
been
told
the
same
thing
dozens
of
times
before
i
think
she
fine
not
exactly
pretty
you
know
but
fine
i
suppose
you
do
know
how
her
father
made
his
money
broke
in
frances
there
was
a
silence
and
molly
feeling
that
she
was
about
to
be
mortified
again
by
something
disagreeable
cried
hastily
oh
dear
i
forgot
the
surprise
do
wait
a
moment
and
dashed
from
the
room
while
she
was
gone
nance
and
judy
began
filling
up
the
intervals
with
odd
bits
of
conversation
helped
out
by
the
other
girls
and
frances
andrews
did
not
have
another
opportunity
to
put
in
her
oar
suddenly
she
rose
and
swept
to
the
door
you
would
none
of
you
feel
interested
to
know
i
suppose
that
mary
stewart
father
started
life
as
a
bootblack
that
what
i
starting
life
as
cried
molly
who
now
appeared
carrying
a
large
tray
covered
with
a
napkin
i
am
the
official
bootblack
of
queen
and
i
make
sometimes
a
week
at
it
i
hope
i
do
as
well
as
stewart
in
the
business
have
a
popover
she
unfolded
the
napkin
and
behold
a
pile
of
golden
muffins
steaming
hot
there
were
wild
cries
of
joy
from
the
kimonoed
company
and
now
jessie
i
take
my
roundabout
compliment
she
began
when
judy
interrupted
her
wo
you
have
a
popover
miss
andrews
she
asked
in
a
cold
exasperated
tone
thanks
i
eat
the
european
breakfast
usually
coffee
and
roll
yes
i
been
there
answered
judy
i
say
good
morning
i
enjoyed
your
little
party
immensely
and
frances
marched
out
of
the
room
and
banged
the
door
i
should
think
you
would
have
learned
a
lesson
by
this
time
molly
brown
cried
judy
hotly
there
is
always
a
row
whenever
that
girl
is
around
she
ca
be
nice
and
there
is
no
use
trying
to
make
her
over
i
sorry
said
molly
penitently
i
wish
i
could
understand
why
she
behaves
that
way
when
she
knows
it
going
to
take
away
what
few
friends
she
has
i
think
i
can
tell
you
put
in
mabel
hinton
nobody
likes
her
and
nobody
expects
any
good
of
her
if
you
are
constantly
on
the
lookout
for
bad
traits
they
are
sure
to
appear
it
almost
a
natural
law
everybody
was
expecting
this
and
so
it
happened
of
course
if
we
had
been
cordial
and
sweet
to
her
she
never
would
have
said
that
about
mary
stewart
or
the
food
at
queen
either
dear
me
are
we
listening
to
a
sermon
broke
in
judy
flippantly
but
in
spite
of
judy
interruption
mabel
speech
made
an
impression
on
the
girls
some
of
whom
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
their
attitude
toward
frances
andrews
did
you
ever
see
a
dog
that
had
been
kicked
all
its
life
went
on
mabel
how
it
snarls
and
bites
and
snaps
at
anybody
who
tries
to
pet
it
well
frances
is
just
a
poor
kicked
dog
she
done
something
she
ought
not
to
have
done
and
she
been
kicked
out
for
it
and
she
so
sore
and
unhappy
she
snarls
at
everybody
who
comes
near
her
mabel
you
a
brick
exclaimed
sallie
marks
i
started
the
fight
this
morning
and
i
ashamed
of
it
i
going
to
make
a
resolution
to
be
nice
to
that
poor
girl
hereafter
no
matter
how
horrid
she
is
it
will
be
an
interesting
experiment
if
for
no
other
reason
let
form
a
society
put
in
molly
to
reinstate
frances
andrews
and
the
way
to
do
it
will
be
to
be
as
nice
as
we
can
to
her
and
to
say
nice
things
about
her
to
the
other
girls
good
work
cried
margaret
wakefield
scenting
another
opportunity
to
draw
up
a
constitution
and
resolutions
we
will
call
a
first
meeting
right
now
and
elect
officers
i
move
that
molly
be
made
chairman
of
the
meeting
i
second
the
motion
said
sallie
heartily
all
in
favor
say
there
was
a
chorus
of
laughing
ayes
and
a
society
was
actually
established
that
morning
molly
as
founder
being
elected
president
it
consisted
of
eight
members
all
freshmen
except
the
sallie
marks
who
condescended
although
a
junior
to
join
suppose
we
vote
on
a
name
now
continued
margaret
who
wished
to
leave
nothing
undone
in
creating
the
club
each
member
has
a
right
to
suggest
two
names
votes
to
be
taken
afterward
it
was
all
very
owing
to
margaret
experienced
methods
but
the
girls
enjoyed
it
and
felt
quite
important
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
the
first
society
to
be
established
that
year
in
the
freshman
class
and
it
developed
afterward
into
a
very
important
organization
among
the
various
names
suggested
were
the
optimists
the
bluebirds
the
glad
hands
mentioned
by
sallie
marks
and
the
happy
hearts
they
are
all
too
sentimental
said
the
astute
margaret
looking
them
over
there
be
so
many
croaks
about
us
if
we
choose
one
of
these
names
that
we
be
crushed
with
ridicule
how
about
these
initials
what
do
they
stand
for
gold
fishes
replied
mabel
hinton
promptly
the
others
laughed
but
the
name
pleased
them
nevertheless
you
see
went
on
mabel
a
gold
fish
always
radiates
a
cheerful
glow
no
matter
where
he
is
he
is
the
most
amiable
contented
little
optimist
in
the
animal
kingdom
and
he
swims
just
as
happily
in
a
finger
bowl
as
he
does
in
a
fish
pond
he
was
evidently
created
to
cheer
up
the
fish
tribe
and
i
sure
he
must
succeed
in
doing
it
the
explanation
was
received
with
applause
and
when
the
votes
were
taken
was
chosen
without
a
dissenting
voice
it
was
decided
that
the
club
was
to
meet
once
a
week
it
object
to
be
in
a
way
the
promotion
of
kindliness
especially
toward
such
people
as
frances
andrews
who
were
friendless
we
be
something
like
the
misericordia
society
in
italy
observed
judy
only
instead
of
looking
after
wounded
and
hurt
people
look
after
wounded
and
hurt
feelings
it
was
further
moved
seconded
and
the
motion
carried
that
the
society
should
be
a
secret
one
that
reports
should
be
read
each
week
by
members
who
had
anything
to
report
and
by
way
of
infusing
a
little
sociability
into
the
society
it
was
to
give
an
entertainment
something
unique
in
the
annals
of
wellington
subject
to
be
thought
of
later
it
was
noon
by
the
time
the
first
meeting
of
the
society
was
ready
to
disband
but
the
girls
had
really
enjoyed
it
in
the
first
place
there
was
an
important
feeling
about
being
an
initial
member
of
a
club
which
had
such
a
beneficial
object
and
was
to
be
so
delightfully
secretive
there
was
in
fact
a
good
deal
of
knight
errantry
in
the
purpose
of
the
who
felt
not
a
little
like
amazonian
cavaliers
looking
for
adventure
on
the
highway
really
you
know
observed
jessie
we
should
be
called
friends
of
the
wallflowers
like
some
men
at
home
who
made
up
their
minds
one
new
year
night
at
a
ball
to
give
a
poor
ugly
girl
who
never
had
partners
the
time
of
her
life
just
once
did
they
do
it
asked
nance
who
imagined
that
she
was
a
wallflower
and
was
always
conscious
when
the
name
was
mentioned
they
certainly
did
answered
jessie
and
when
i
saw
the
girl
afterward
in
the
dressing
room
she
said
to
me
jessie
was
it
heaven
she
cried
a
little
i
was
ashamed
by
the
way
jessie
i
never
got
my
compliment
said
molly
pay
it
to
me
this
instant
or
i
shall
be
thinking
i
have
had
a
deal
well
here
it
is
answered
jessie
it
has
been
passed
along
considerably
but
it
all
the
more
valuable
for
taking
such
a
roundabout
route
to
get
to
you
i
warn
you
beforehand
that
you
will
probably
have
an
electric
shock
when
you
hear
it
you
know
i
have
some
cousins
who
live
up
in
new
york
one
of
them
writes
to
me
girl
or
man
demanded
judy
man
answered
jessie
blushing
there
was
a
laugh
at
this
because
jessie
beaux
were
numerous
his
best
friend
she
continued
has
a
sister
and
that
sister
do
you
follow
is
an
intimate
friend
intimate
friend
of
an
intimate
friend
one
of
the
girls
interrupted
yes
said
jessie
it
obscure
but
perfectly
logical
my
intimate
friend
sister
has
an
intimate
friend
miss
green
oh
ho
cried
judy
now
we
are
getting
down
to
rock
bottom
and
miss
green
told
her
intimate
friend
who
told
my
cousin
intimate
friend
sister
it
a
little
involved
but
i
think
i
have
it
straight
who
told
her
brother
who
told
my
cousin
who
wrote
it
to
me
but
what
did
he
write
they
demanded
in
a
chorus
that
one
of
miss
green
brothers
was
crushed
on
a
charming
girl
from
kentucky
molly
face
turned
crimson
but
dodo
is
crushed
on
judy
she
laughed
it
may
be
said
jessie
rumors
are
most
generally
twisted
the
first
meeting
of
the
now
disbanded
and
the
members
scattered
to
dress
for
the
early
sunday
dinner
they
all
attended
vespers
that
afternoon
and
in
the
quiet
hour
of
the
impressive
service
more
than
one
pondered
seriously
upon
the
conversation
of
the
morning
and
the
purpose
of
the
new
club
chapter
xiii
trickery
it
was
several
days
before
the
had
an
opportunity
to
practise
any
of
their
new
resolutions
on
frances
andrews
the
eccentric
girl
was
in
the
habit
of
skipping
meals
and
eating
at
off
hours
at
a
little
restaurant
in
the
village
or
taking
ice
cream
sundaes
in
the
drug
store
at
last
however
she
did
appear
at
supper
in
a
beautiful
dinner
dress
of
lavender
cr√™pe
de
chine
with
an
immense
bunch
of
violets
pinned
at
her
belt
she
looked
very
handsome
and
the
girls
could
not
refrain
from
giving
her
covert
glances
of
admiration
as
she
took
her
seat
stonily
at
the
table
it
was
the
impetuous
precipitate
judy
who
took
the
lead
in
the
promotion
of
kindliness
and
her
premature
act
came
near
to
cutting
down
the
new
club
in
its
budding
infancy
you
must
be
going
to
a
party
she
began
flashing
one
of
her
ingratiating
smiles
at
frances
frances
looked
at
her
with
an
icy
stare
i
i
mean
stammered
judy
you
are
wearing
such
an
exquisite
dress
it
too
fine
for
ordinary
occasions
like
this
frances
rose
markham
she
said
to
the
matron
of
queen
if
i
ca
eat
here
without
having
my
clothes
sneered
at
i
shall
be
obliged
to
have
my
meals
carried
to
my
room
hereafter
then
she
marched
out
of
the
dining
room
markham
looked
greatly
embarrassed
and
nobody
spoke
for
some
time
good
heavens
said
judy
at
last
in
a
low
voice
to
molly
what
to
be
done
now
why
do
you
write
her
a
little
note
replied
molly
and
tell
her
that
you
had
meant
to
hurt
her
feelings
and
had
honestly
admired
her
dress
apologize
exclaimed
judy
her
proud
spirit
recoiling
at
the
ignoble
thought
i
simply
could
but
since
her
attack
on
molly
judy
had
been
very
much
ashamed
of
herself
and
she
was
now
taking
what
she
called
in
broken
doses
like
the
calomel
treatment
that
night
she
actually
wrote
a
note
to
frances
and
shoved
it
under
the
door
in
answer
to
this
abject
missive
she
received
one
line
written
with
purple
ink
on
highly
scented
heavy
note
paper
dear
miss
kean
it
ran
i
accept
your
apology
yours
sincerely
frances
le
grand
andrews
le
grand
that
a
good
name
for
her
laughed
judy
sniffing
at
the
perfumed
paper
with
some
disgust
but
she
wrote
an
elaborate
report
regarding
the
incident
and
read
it
aloud
to
the
assembled
at
their
second
meeting
in
the
meantime
sallie
marks
had
her
innings
with
the
redoubtable
frances
and
retreated
wearing
the
sad
and
martyred
smile
of
one
who
is
determined
not
to
resent
an
insult
one
by
one
the
took
occasion
to
be
polite
and
kind
to
the
scornful
suspicious
frances
her
malicious
speeches
were
ignored
and
her
vulgarities
and
she
had
many
of
them
passed
lightly
over
little
by
little
she
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
refinement
did
not
mean
priggishness
and
that
vulgarity
was
not
humor
of
course
the
change
came
very
gradually
not
infrequently
after
a
sophomore
snub
the
whipped
dog
snarled
savagely
or
she
would
brazenly
try
to
shock
the
supper
table
with
a
coarse
slangy
speech
but
with
the
persistent
friendliness
of
the
girls
the
fires
in
her
nature
began
to
die
down
and
the
intervals
between
grew
longer
each
day
frances
andrews
was
the
first
subject
of
the
and
they
were
as
interested
in
her
regeneration
as
a
group
of
learned
doctors
in
the
recovery
of
a
dangerously
ill
patient
in
the
meantime
the
busy
college
life
hummed
on
and
molly
felt
her
head
swimming
sometimes
with
its
variety
and
fullness
what
with
coaching
judy
blacking
boots
making
certain
delicious
sweetmeats
called
cloudbursts
the
recipe
of
which
was
her
own
secret
which
sold
like
hot
cakes
keeping
up
the
social
end
and
the
study
end
molly
was
beginning
to
feel
tired
a
wanness
began
to
show
in
the
dark
shadows
under
her
eyes
and
the
pinched
look
about
her
lips
even
as
early
as
the
eventful
evening
when
she
posed
for
the
senior
living
picture
show
this
child
needs
some
the
august
senior
president
had
exclaimed
where
the
rouge
and
who
got
my
rabbit
foot
no
burned
cork
makes
too
broad
a
line
give
me
one
of
the
lighter
colored
eyebrow
pencils
you
must
lose
your
color
little
girl
she
said
dabbing
a
spot
of
red
on
each
of
molly
pale
cheeks
your
roses
are
one
of
your
chief
attractions
a
great
many
students
and
some
of
the
faculty
had
bought
tickets
for
this
notable
occasion
and
the
gymnasium
was
well
filled
before
the
curtain
was
drawn
back
from
a
gigantic
gold
frame
disclosing
mary
stewart
as
joan
of
arc
in
the
picture
by
bastien
le
page
which
hangs
in
the
metropolitan
museum
of
art
in
new
york
there
was
no
attempt
to
reproduce
the
atmospheric
visions
of
the
angel
and
the
knight
in
armor
only
the
poor
peasant
girl
standing
in
the
cabbage
patch
her
face
transfigured
with
inspiration
when
molly
saw
mary
stewart
pose
in
this
picture
at
the
dress
rehearsal
she
could
not
help
recalling
the
story
of
the
bootblack
father
she
has
a
wonderful
face
and
i
call
it
beautiful
if
other
people
do
she
said
to
herself
as
for
our
little
freshman
so
dazed
and
heavy
was
she
with
fatigue
the
night
of
the
entertainment
that
she
never
knew
she
had
created
a
sensation
first
as
botticelli
flora
barefooted
and
wearing
a
greek
dress
constructed
of
cheesecloth
and
then
as
hamilton
in
the
blue
crepe
with
a
gauzy
fichu
around
her
neck
after
the
exhibition
when
all
the
actors
were
endeavoring
to
collect
their
belongings
in
the
confusion
of
the
green
room
sallie
marks
came
running
behind
the
scenes
prexy
has
specially
requested
you
to
repeat
the
flora
picture
she
announced
breathlessly
is
prexy
here
they
demanded
with
much
excitement
she
is
so
answered
sallie
she
up
in
the
balcony
with
professor
green
and
miss
pomeroy
well
what
do
you
think
we
been
performing
before
victoria
and
other
members
of
the
royal
family
like
barnum
and
never
knew
a
thing
about
it
said
a
funny
senior
demonstrations
by
the
delighted
multitude
almost
taking
the
form
of
ovations
she
proceeded
do
talk
so
much
lulu
and
help
us
for
heaven
sake
where
molly
brown
of
kentucky
called
the
distracted
president
molly
came
forth
at
the
summons
overcome
by
an
extreme
fatigue
she
had
been
sitting
on
a
bench
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
room
behind
some
stage
property
here
little
one
take
off
your
shoes
and
stockings
and
get
into
your
flora
costume
quick
by
order
of
prexy
in
a
few
minutes
molly
stood
poised
on
the
tips
of
her
toes
in
the
gold
frame
the
lights
went
down
the
bell
rang
and
the
curtains
were
parted
by
two
freshmen
appointed
for
this
duty
for
one
brief
fleeting
glance
the
audience
saw
the
immortal
flora
floating
on
thin
air
apparently
and
then
the
entire
gymnasium
was
in
total
darkness
a
wave
of
conversation
and
giggling
filled
the
void
of
blackness
while
on
the
stage
the
seniors
were
rushing
around
falling
over
each
other
and
calling
for
matches
who
light
manager
where
lulu
lulu
lulu
where
the
switch
lulu
asleep
at
the
switch
sang
a
chorus
of
juniors
from
the
audience
i
not
called
lulu
i
here
on
the
job
but
the
switch
work
telephone
to
the
engineer
light
the
gas
somebody
but
there
were
no
matches
and
the
only
man
in
the
house
was
in
the
balcony
however
he
managed
to
grope
his
way
to
the
steps
leading
to
the
platform
where
he
suddenly
struck
a
match
to
the
wild
joy
of
the
audience
choruses
from
various
quarters
had
been
calling
do
blow
out
the
gas
keep
it
dark
and
one
girl
created
a
laugh
by
announcing
the
present
picture
represents
a
by
whistler
then
the
janitor
began
lighting
gas
jets
along
the
wall
and
finally
a
lonesome
gas
jet
on
the
stage
faintly
illumined
the
scene
of
confusion
the
gigantic
gilt
frame
outlined
a
dark
picture
of
hurrying
forms
and
huddled
in
the
foreground
lay
a
limp
white
object
for
flora
had
fainted
away
the
confusion
increased
the
president
joined
the
excited
seniors
and
presently
the
doctor
appeared
fetched
by
the
professor
of
english
literature
flora
was
lifted
onto
a
couch
her
own
gray
cape
thrown
over
her
and
opening
her
eyes
in
a
few
minutes
she
became
molly
brown
of
kentucky
she
gazed
confusedly
at
the
faces
hovering
over
her
in
the
half
light
the
doctor
at
one
side
the
president
at
the
other
mary
stewart
and
professor
green
standing
at
the
foot
and
a
crowd
of
seniors
like
a
mob
in
the
background
suddenly
molly
sat
up
she
brushed
her
auburn
hair
from
her
face
and
pointed
vaguely
toward
the
hall
i
saw
her
when
she
she
began
her
eye
caught
professor
green
and
she
fell
back
on
the
couch
you
saw
what
my
child
asked
the
president
kindly
i
reckon
i
was
just
dreaming
answered
molly
her
southern
accent
more
marked
than
ever
before
the
president
of
the
senior
class
now
hurried
up
to
the
president
of
wellington
university
miss
walker
she
exclaimed
her
voice
trembling
with
indignation
we
have
just
found
out
or
rather
the
engineer
has
discovered
that
some
one
has
cut
the
electric
wires
it
was
a
clean
cut
right
through
i
do
think
it
was
an
outrage
she
was
almost
sobbing
in
her
righteous
anger
the
president
face
looked
very
grave
are
you
sure
of
this
she
asked
it
true
put
in
the
engineer
who
had
followed
close
on
the
heels
of
the
senior
without
a
word
president
walker
rose
and
walked
to
the
centre
of
the
platform
with
much
subdued
merriment
the
students
were
leaving
the
gymnasium
in
a
body
lifting
a
small
chair
standing
near
she
rapped
with
it
on
the
floor
for
order
instantly
every
student
faced
the
platform
and
those
who
had
not
reached
the
aisles
sat
down
young
ladies
began
the
president
in
her
calm
cultivated
tones
that
could
strike
terror
to
the
heart
of
any
erring
student
i
wish
to
speak
a
word
with
you
before
you
leave
the
gymnasium
probably
most
of
you
are
aware
by
this
time
that
the
accident
to
the
electric
lighting
was
really
not
an
accident
at
all
but
the
result
of
a
deliberate
act
by
some
one
in
this
room
of
course
i
realize
that
in
so
large
a
body
of
students
as
we
have
at
wellington
university
there
must
of
necessity
be
some
black
sheep
these
we
endeavor
by
every
effort
to
regenerate
and
by
it
is
usually
not
a
difficult
matter
to
discover
those
who
are
in
earnest
and
those
who
consider
wellington
college
merely
a
place
of
amusement
those
who
do
consider
it
as
such
naturally
do
not
er
remain
with
us
after
to
molly
sitting
on
the
platform
and
to
other
trembling
freshmen
in
the
audience
the
president
seemed
for
the
moment
like
a
great
and
stern
judge
who
had
appointed
as
the
time
for
a
general
execution
of
criminals
i
consider
went
on
the
speaker
in
slow
and
even
tones
idleness
a
most
unfortunate
quality
and
i
am
prepared
to
combat
it
and
to
convince
any
of
my
girls
who
show
that
tendency
that
good
hard
work
and
only
good
hard
work
will
bring
success
a
great
many
girls
come
here
preferring
idleness
and
learn
to
repent
it
before
a
wave
of
subdued
laughter
swept
over
the
audience
but
said
the
president
her
voice
growing
louder
and
sterner
young
ladies
i
am
not
prepared
to
combat
chicanery
and
trickery
by
anything
except
the
most
severe
measures
and
if
there
is
one
among
you
who
thinks
and
believes
she
can
commit
such
despicable
follies
as
that
which
has
been
done
and
escape
i
would
say
to
her
that
she
is
mistaken
i
shall
not
endure
such
treachery
it
shall
be
rooted
out
for
the
honor
and
the
illustrious
name
of
this
institution
i
now
ask
each
one
of
you
to
help
me
and
if
there
is
one
among
you
who
knows
the
culprit
and
does
not
report
it
to
me
at
once
i
shall
hold
that
girl
as
responsible
as
the
real
culprit
you
may
go
now
and
think
well
over
what
i
have
said
the
president
retired
and
the
students
filed
soberly
and
quietly
from
the
gymnasium
how
do
you
feel
now
dear
asked
president
walker
leaning
over
molly
and
taking
her
hand
much
better
thank
you
answered
molly
timidly
could
you
hear
what
i
was
saying
to
the
girls
continued
the
president
looking
at
her
closely
yes
faltered
molly
think
over
it
then
and
you
had
better
stay
in
bed
a
few
days
until
you
feel
better
have
you
prescribed
for
her
doctor
the
doctor
nodded
he
was
a
bluff
kindly
scotchman
a
little
an√¶mic
and
tired
out
a
good
tonic
and
more
sleep
will
put
her
to
rights
mary
stewart
had
telephoned
for
a
carriage
to
take
molly
home
and
judy
filled
with
passionate
devotion
when
anything
was
the
matter
hurried
ahead
to
turn
down
the
bed
lay
out
gown
and
wrapper
and
make
a
cup
of
bouillon
out
of
hot
water
and
a
beef
juice
capsule
and
finally
assist
her
beloved
friend
whom
she
occasionally
chastened
to
remove
her
clothes
and
get
into
bed
i
may
not
have
many
chances
to
wait
on
you
molly
darling
she
exclaimed
when
molly
protested
at
so
much
devotion
i
may
not
have
a
chance
after
if
she
had
mentioned
death
itself
she
could
not
have
used
a
more
tragic
tone
judy
cried
molly
slipping
her
arms
around
her
friend
neck
not
going
to
let
you
go
at
if
i
have
to
study
for
two
chapter
xiv
an
inspiration
this
is
like
having
a
bedroom
exclaimed
molly
with
a
hospitable
smile
to
some
dozen
guests
who
adorned
the
divans
and
easy
chairs
the
floor
and
window
sills
of
her
room
surely
there
was
nothing
molly
liked
better
than
to
entertain
and
when
she
had
callers
she
always
entertained
them
with
refreshments
of
some
kind
often
it
had
to
be
crackers
and
sweet
chocolate
and
she
had
even
been
reduced
to
tea
but
usually
her
family
kept
her
supplied
with
good
things
and
her
larder
was
generally
well
stocked
she
lay
in
bed
propped
up
with
pillows
and
scattered
about
the
bed
were
and
papers
you
been
studying
again
you
naughty
child
exclaimed
mary
stewart
shaking
her
finger
did
mclean
tell
you
to
go
easy
for
the
next
week
go
easy
indeed
laughed
molly
you
might
as
well
tell
a
trapeze
actor
to
do
the
and
hold
on
tight
at
the
same
time
but
worth
losing
a
few
days
to
find
out
what
loving
friends
i
have
your
pink
roses
are
the
loveliest
of
all
she
added
squeezing
her
hand
tell
us
exactly
who
sent
you
each
bunch
demanded
jessie
passing
a
box
of
while
judy
performed
miracles
with
a
tea
ball
a
small
kettle
and
a
varied
assortment
of
cups
and
saucers
i
have
a
right
to
ask
you
continued
jessica
because
you
asked
the
same
question
of
me
last
tuesday
when
two
boxes
came
no
suitor
sent
me
any
of
these
mistress
jessica
answered
molly
because
i
have
any
miss
stewart
sent
the
pink
ones
and
the
president
of
the
senior
class
sent
the
red
ones
judy
brought
me
the
double
violets
and
nance
the
lilies
of
the
valley
bless
them
both
and
another
senior
the
pot
of
pansies
the
seniors
have
certainly
been
sweet
and
lovely
there
one
you
have
accounted
for
interrupted
jessie
the
violets
asked
molly
blushing
slightly
oh
ho
cried
jessie
in
her
high
musical
voice
trying
to
crawl
were
you
you
ca
deceive
old
grandmamma
honor
bright
who
sent
the
violets
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
know
i
suspected
frances
andrews
but
when
i
thanked
her
for
them
she
looked
horribly
embarrassed
and
said
she
had
sent
them
i
was
afraid
she
would
go
down
and
get
some
after
my
break
but
thank
goodness
she
had
the
good
taste
not
to
you
mean
to
say
they
were
anonymous
demanded
jessie
i
mean
to
say
that
thing
but
i
suppose
some
of
the
seniors
who
preferred
to
remain
unknown
sent
them
it
just
possible
put
in
mary
and
the
subject
was
dropped
let
talk
about
the
only
thing
worth
talking
about
just
now
broke
in
judy
the
flopping
of
flora
or
who
cut
the
wires
why
talk
about
it
said
molly
you
could
never
reach
any
conclusion
and
guessing
does
help
oh
just
as
a
matter
of
interest
replied
judy
for
instance
if
we
were
detectives
and
put
on
the
case
how
would
we
go
about
finding
the
criminal
i
should
look
for
a
silly
said
mary
stewart
some
foolish
girl
who
wanted
to
do
a
clever
thing
freshmen
at
boys
colleges
are
often
like
that
you
do
think
it
was
a
freshman
do
you
miss
stewart
cried
mabel
hinton
turning
her
round
spectacles
on
mary
like
a
large
serious
owl
oh
no
indeed
i
was
only
joking
i
have
the
remotest
notion
who
it
is
if
i
were
a
detective
on
the
case
said
mabel
hinton
i
should
look
for
a
junior
who
was
jealous
of
the
seniors
some
one
who
had
a
grudge
perhaps
if
i
were
a
detective
announced
margaret
wakefield
in
her
most
judicial
manner
i
should
look
for
some
one
who
had
a
grudge
against
molly
of
course
i
never
thought
of
that
it
did
happen
just
as
molly
was
about
to
give
the
encore
did
it
it
did
answered
margaret
the
girls
had
all
stopped
chattering
in
duets
and
trios
to
listen
has
any
one
in
the
world
the
heart
to
have
a
grudge
against
you
you
sweet
child
exclaimed
mary
stewart
placing
her
rather
large
strong
hand
over
molly
the
young
freshman
looked
uncomfortable
i
hope
not
she
said
smiling
faintly
i
never
meant
to
give
offence
to
any
one
pretty
soon
the
company
dispersed
and
molly
was
left
alone
with
her
two
best
friends
judy
she
said
will
you
please
settle
down
to
work
this
instant
you
know
you
have
to
write
your
theme
and
get
it
in
by
noon
and
you
have
touched
it
so
far
nance
was
already
deep
in
her
english
molly
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
sighed
i
ca
do
it
she
whispered
to
herself
i
simply
can
not
do
it
but
what
she
referred
to
only
she
herself
knew
in
the
meantime
judy
chewed
the
end
of
her
pencil
and
looked
absently
at
her
friend
back
presently
she
gave
the
pad
on
her
lap
an
impatient
toss
in
one
direction
and
the
pencil
in
another
and
flung
herself
on
the
foot
of
molly
couch
do
scold
me
molly
i
never
compose
except
under
inspiration
and
inspiration
does
seem
to
be
on
very
good
terms
with
me
just
now
she
has
visited
me
in
an
age
nonsense
you
know
perfectly
well
you
can
write
that
theme
if
you
set
your
mind
to
it
judy
kean
you
are
just
too
lazy
you
have
even
chosen
a
subject
i
wager
anything
no
said
judy
sadly
why
do
you
write
a
short
story
you
have
plenty
of
material
with
all
your
travel
i
know
what
i
write
judy
interrupted
her
excitedly
the
motives
of
crime
how
absurd
objected
molly
besides
do
you
think
that
a
little
personal
just
now
when
the
whole
school
is
talking
about
the
not
at
all
we
are
all
trying
to
run
down
the
criminal
anyhow
i
shall
take
the
five
great
motives
which
lead
to
crime
anger
jealousy
hatred
envy
and
greed
it
will
make
an
interesting
discourse
see
if
it
does
the
idea
of
your
writing
on
such
a
subject
laughed
molly
you
not
a
criminal
lawyer
or
a
prosecuting
attorney
i
admit
it
answered
judy
and
i
suppose
lawyer
margaret
wakefield
ought
to
be
the
one
to
handle
the
subject
but
nevertheless
i
am
fired
with
inspiration
and
i
intend
to
write
it
myself
i
shall
not
see
you
again
until
the
deed
is
done
if
it
takes
all
night
by
the
way
lend
me
some
coffee
will
you
i
all
out
and
i
always
make
some
on
the
samovar
for
purposes
when
i
going
to
work
at
night
i
do
know
what
i
going
to
do
with
you
judy
sighed
molly
as
the
incorrigible
girl
sailed
out
of
the
room
a
jar
of
coffee
under
one
arm
and
her
writing
pad
under
the
other
at
first
she
wrote
intermittently
rumpling
up
her
hair
with
both
hands
and
chewing
her
pencil
savagely
but
gradually
her
thoughts
took
form
and
the
pencil
moved
steadily
along
almost
like
it
seemed
to
her
until
the
essay
was
done
it
was
three
and
rain
and
hail
beat
a
dismal
tattoo
on
her
window
pane
she
had
not
even
noticed
the
storm
having
hung
a
bed
quilt
over
her
window
and
tacked
a
dressing
gown
across
the
transom
to
conceal
the
light
of
the
student
lamp
from
the
watchful
matron
putting
out
her
light
and
removing
all
signs
of
disobedience
she
now
cheerfully
went
to
bed
motives
for
crime
she
chuckled
to
herself
i
suppose
i
committing
a
small
crime
for
disobeying
the
rule
and
my
motive
is
to
hand
in
a
theme
on
time
the
next
morning
when
judy
read
over
her
night
work
she
enjoyed
it
very
much
it
really
quite
interesting
she
said
to
herself
i
really
do
see
how
i
ever
did
it
she
delivered
the
essay
at
miss
pomeroy
office
and
felt
vastly
proud
when
she
laid
it
on
the
table
near
the
desk
her
own
cleverness
told
her
that
she
had
done
a
good
thing
i
do
believe
wordsworth
ever
enjoyed
his
own
works
more
than
i
do
mine
she
observed
as
she
strolled
across
the
campus
and
because
i
been
i
shall
now
take
a
rest
and
go
forth
in
search
of
amusement
she
turned
her
face
toward
the
village
where
a
kind
of
oriental
bazaar
was
being
held
by
some
syrians
it
would
be
fun
she
thought
to
look
over
their
bangles
and
slippers
and
bead
necklaces
in
the
meantime
miss
pomeroy
was
engaged
in
reading
over
judy
theme
which
having
been
handed
in
last
had
come
to
her
notice
first
such
is
the
luck
of
the
procrastinator
she
smiled
when
she
saw
the
title
but
the
theme
interested
her
greatly
and
presently
she
tucked
it
into
her
long
reticule
familiar
to
every
wellington
girl
and
hastened
over
to
the
president
house
emma
she
said
the
two
women
were
old
college
mates
and
were
emma
and
louise
in
private
i
think
this
might
interest
you
it
a
theme
by
one
of
my
freshman
girls
a
strange
subject
for
a
girl
of
seventeen
but
she
quite
a
remarkable
person
if
she
would
only
apply
herself
somehow
it
seems
whether
consciously
or
unconsciously
to
bear
on
what
has
been
occupying
us
all
so
much
since
last
friday
the
president
put
on
her
glasses
and
began
to
read
judy
theme
every
now
and
then
she
gave
a
low
amused
chuckle
the
child
writes
like
marie
corelli
she
exclaimed
laughing
and
yet
it
is
clever
and
it
does
suggest
she
paused
and
frowned
i
wonder
if
she
could
and
does
dare
tell
she
added
slowly
i
wonder
echoed
miss
pomeroy
is
she
one
of
the
queen
cottage
girls
they
appear
to
be
rather
a
remarkable
lot
this
year
some
of
them
are
very
bright
said
miss
pomeroy
louise
said
the
president
suddenly
frances
andrews
is
one
of
the
girls
at
that
house
is
she
not
yes
nodded
the
other
with
a
queer
look
on
her
face
she
clever
said
the
president
she
deep
emma
it
is
impossible
to
make
any
definite
statement
about
her
one
must
go
very
slowly
in
these
things
but
after
what
happened
last
year
you
know
she
paused
even
with
her
most
intimate
friend
she
disliked
to
discuss
certain
secrets
of
the
institution
openly
yes
said
miss
pomeroy
she
is
either
very
deep
or
entirely
innocent
some
one
is
guilty
sighed
the
president
i
do
wish
i
knew
who
it
was
judy
theme
not
only
received
especial
mention
by
miss
pomeroy
but
it
was
read
aloud
to
the
entire
class
and
was
later
published
in
the
college
paper
to
judy
everlasting
joy
and
glory
she
was
congratulated
about
it
on
all
sides
and
her
heart
was
swollen
with
pride
i
think
i
take
to
writing
in
dead
earnest
she
said
to
molly
because
i
have
the
happy
faculty
of
writing
on
subjects
i
do
know
anything
about
and
no
one
knows
the
difference
i
wish
you
take
to
doing
anything
in
dead
earnest
molly
replied
giving
her
friend
a
little
impatient
shake
chapter
xv
planning
and
wishing
anna
oldham
the
famous
suffragette
will
speak
in
the
gymnasium
on
saturday
afternoon
at
four
on
suffrage
all
those
interested
in
this
subject
are
invited
to
be
present
molly
and
judy
with
a
crowd
of
friends
on
the
way
from
one
classroom
to
another
one
busy
friday
had
paused
in
front
of
the
bulletin
board
in
the
main
corridor
anna
oldham
they
repeated
trying
to
remember
where
they
had
heard
the
name
before
why
judy
whispered
molly
that
must
be
nance
mother
do
you
do
you
suppose
nance
knows
if
she
does
she
has
never
mentioned
it
you
know
she
never
tells
anything
she
a
perfect
clam
but
this
somehow
is
different
both
girls
thought
of
their
own
mothers
immediately
surely
they
would
have
shouted
aloud
such
news
as
nance
had
shall
we
mention
it
to
her
or
do
you
think
we
better
wait
and
let
her
introduce
the
subject
asked
molly
surely
she
corresponds
with
her
own
mother
exclaimed
judy
without
answering
molly
question
her
father
writes
to
her
about
once
a
week
i
know
but
i
do
think
she
hears
very
often
from
oldham
you
see
her
mother
away
most
of
the
time
lecturing
lecturing
fiddlesticks
cried
judy
indignantly
what
kind
of
a
mother
is
she
i
like
to
know
i
bet
you
anything
nance
know
at
all
she
going
to
be
here
i
think
we
ought
to
tell
her
molly
poor
nance
answered
molly
i
do
know
which
would
mortify
her
most
to
know
or
not
to
know
suppose
we
find
out
in
some
tactful
roundabout
way
whether
she
knows
and
then
i
offer
to
go
in
with
you
saturday
night
and
give
her
mother
my
bed
judy
cordially
consented
to
this
arrangement
having
a
bed
in
her
small
room
although
secretly
she
was
not
fond
of
sharing
it
and
preferred
both
her
bed
and
her
room
to
herself
it
was
not
until
much
later
in
the
day
that
they
saw
nance
who
appeared
to
be
radiantly
and
buoyantly
happy
her
usually
quiet
face
was
aglow
with
a
soft
light
and
as
she
passed
her
two
friends
she
waved
a
letter
at
them
gayly
you
see
she
knows
and
she
is
delighted
exclaimed
judy
just
as
we
would
be
oh
molly
wait
until
you
see
my
mother
if
you
want
to
meet
a
thing
of
beauty
and
a
joy
forever
you
think
i
was
her
mother
instead
of
her
being
mine
she
is
so
little
and
sweet
and
dainty
molly
laughed
is
she
coming
up
soon
i
dearly
love
to
meet
her
i
afraid
not
you
know
papa
is
always
flying
off
on
trips
and
mamma
goes
with
him
everywhere
i
used
to
too
before
i
decided
to
be
educated
it
was
awfully
exciting
we
often
got
ready
on
a
notice
to
go
thousands
of
miles
to
san
francisco
or
alaska
or
mexico
anywhere
papa
is
exactly
like
me
or
rather
i
am
exactly
like
him
only
he
is
a
hundred
times
better
looking
and
more
fascinating
and
charming
than
i
can
ever
hope
to
be
you
funny
child
exclaimed
molly
how
do
you
know
you
are
not
all
those
things
right
now
i
know
i
not
sighed
judy
papa
is
brilliant
and
not
a
bit
lazy
he
works
all
the
time
so
would
you
if
you
only
wanted
to
you
only
choose
to
be
lazy
if
i
had
your
mind
and
opportunities
there
is
no
end
to
what
i
would
do
judy
looked
at
her
in
surprise
why
molly
do
you
think
i
have
any
mind
she
asked
one
of
the
best
in
the
freshman
class
answered
her
friend
but
look
here
are
some
letters
she
paused
in
the
hall
of
queen
cottage
to
look
over
a
pile
of
mail
which
had
been
brought
that
afternoon
there
were
several
letters
for
the
girls
judy
from
both
her
parents
who
wrote
to
her
assiduously
and
molly
numerous
home
epistles
from
her
sisters
and
mother
but
there
were
two
one
for
each
of
the
girls
with
the
exmoor
postmark
on
them
molly
opened
hers
first
oh
judy
she
exclaimed
do
you
remember
that
nice
exmoor
sophomore
named
he
wants
to
come
over
saturday
afternoon
to
call
and
go
walking
dodo
has
probably
written
the
same
thing
to
you
i
see
you
have
an
exmoor
letter
he
has
answered
judy
perusing
her
note
he
wishes
the
honor
of
my
company
for
a
short
walk
evidently
they
do
think
we
have
many
engagements
since
they
do
give
us
time
to
answer
their
notes
judy
molly
the
two
girls
looked
at
each
other
for
a
brief
moment
and
then
broke
into
a
laugh
nance
letter
must
have
been
from
one
of
the
others
andy
mclean
perhaps
that
was
why
she
was
so
judy
paused
somehow
it
did
seem
very
kind
to
imply
that
poor
nance
was
elated
over
her
first
beau
dear
sweet
old
nance
cried
molly
her
heart
warming
to
her
friend
she
will
probably
have
them
by
the
dozens
some
of
these
days
i
sure
i
should
camp
on
her
trail
if
i
were
a
man
said
judy
loyally
but
molly
she
added
laughing
again
what
are
we
to
do
about
old
mrs
oldham
oh
dear
i
had
thought
of
that
and
poor
nance
would
have
enjoyed
the
walk
so
much
more
than
a
learned
discourse
on
woman
rights
just
before
supper
time
nance
burst
into
the
room
she
was
humming
a
waltz
tune
her
cheeks
looked
flushed
and
she
went
briskly
over
to
the
mirror
and
glanced
at
her
image
quickly
while
she
took
off
her
tam
and
sweater
the
girls
had
never
seen
her
looking
so
pretty
they
waited
for
her
to
mention
the
note
but
she
talked
of
other
things
until
judy
always
impatient
to
force
events
exclaimed
what
was
that
note
you
were
waving
at
us
this
afternoon
nance
oh
that
was
from
a
tap
on
the
door
interrupted
her
and
margaret
wakefield
entered
oh
nance
she
cried
i
am
so
excited
over
your
mother
coming
to
speak
at
college
afternoon
is
it
fine
of
her
it
miss
bowles
professor
in
advanced
who
is
bringing
her
you
know
of
course
except
that
her
face
turned
perfectly
white
nance
showed
no
sign
whatever
that
she
had
received
a
staggering
blow
but
her
two
friends
felt
for
her
deeply
and
molly
came
to
her
rescue
by
the
way
nance
dearest
she
said
i
thought
you
might
want
to
have
your
mother
with
you
night
and
i
was
going
to
offer
you
my
bed
and
turn
in
with
judy
thanks
molly
answered
nance
huskily
that
would
be
nice
very
little
ever
escaped
the
alert
eyes
of
margaret
wakefield
but
if
she
noticed
anything
strange
in
nance
manner
she
made
no
comment
whatever
she
was
a
fine
girl
full
of
sympathy
and
understanding
with
a
certain
dignity
of
manner
that
is
seldom
seen
in
a
young
girl
it
will
be
quite
a
gala
event
at
queen
if
oldham
eats
supper
here
she
said
gently
but
no
doubt
she
will
be
claimed
by
some
of
the
faculty
then
she
slipped
quietly
out
of
the
room
just
in
time
for
quiet
nance
burst
suddenly
into
a
storm
of
weeping
and
flung
herself
on
the
bed
and
she
never
even
took
the
trouble
to
tell
me
she
sobbed
brokenly
she
has
probably
forgotten
that
i
am
even
going
to
wellington
it
was
a
difficult
moment
for
molly
and
judy
would
it
be
more
tactful
to
slip
out
of
the
room
or
to
try
and
comfort
nance
after
all
she
had
had
very
little
sympathy
in
her
life
and
sympathy
was
what
she
craved
and
love
too
molly
felt
sure
of
this
and
with
an
instinct
stronger
than
reason
she
slipped
down
beside
her
friend
on
the
couch
and
put
her
arms
around
her
darling
sweetest
nance
she
cried
i
am
sure
the
message
will
come
perhaps
she
telegraph
and
they
will
telephone
from
the
village
judy
and
i
love
you
so
dearly
it
breaks
our
hearts
to
see
you
cry
like
this
does
it
judy
indeed
it
does
answered
judy
who
was
kneeling
at
the
side
of
the
couch
with
her
cheek
against
nance
hand
it
was
a
comfort
to
nance
to
realize
that
she
had
gained
the
friendship
and
affection
of
these
two
loving
girls
never
in
her
life
had
she
met
any
girls
like
them
and
presently
the
bitterness
in
her
heart
began
to
melt
away
perhaps
she
will
telegraph
she
said
drying
her
eyes
it
was
silly
of
me
to
take
on
so
but
you
see
i
had
a
little
shock
i
all
right
now
you
dears
both
of
you
judy
went
into
her
own
room
and
returned
in
a
moment
with
a
large
bottle
of
german
cologne
filling
the
stationary
wash
basin
with
cold
water
she
poured
in
a
liberal
quantity
of
the
cologne
now
dearest
nance
she
said
bathe
your
face
in
that
and
then
powder
with
molly
pink
rice
powder
and
all
will
be
as
if
it
never
had
been
she
added
smiling
the
others
smiled
too
somehow
nance
outburst
had
done
her
more
good
than
harm
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
been
coddled
and
sympathized
with
and
petted
it
was
almost
worth
while
to
have
suffered
to
have
gained
such
rewards
after
all
there
were
some
pleasant
things
in
life
for
instance
the
note
which
had
come
to
her
that
afternoon
from
young
andy
mclean
son
of
mclean
the
college
physician
to
think
that
she
the
little
gray
mouse
as
her
father
had
often
called
her
had
inspired
any
one
with
a
desire
to
see
her
again
it
was
almost
impossible
to
believe
but
there
was
the
young
scotchman
note
to
refute
all
contrary
arguments
dear
miss
oldham
it
said
in
a
good
round
handwriting
i
have
been
wanting
so
much
to
see
you
again
since
our
jolly
day
at
exmoor
i
am
bringing
some
fellows
over
on
saturday
to
supper
at
my
father
if
you
should
happen
to
be
in
about
four
may
i
call
how
about
a
walk
before
supper
i
ca
tell
you
how
disappointed
i
be
if
you
have
another
engagement
yours
sincerely
andrew
mclean
of
course
she
would
have
to
give
up
the
walk
now
but
it
was
pleasant
to
have
been
remembered
and
perhaps
he
would
come
again
that
night
at
supper
nance
was
unusually
bright
and
talkative
she
answered
all
the
many
questions
concerning
her
famous
mother
so
easily
and
pleasantly
that
even
margaret
wakefield
must
have
been
deceived
the
two
sophomores
at
queen
were
giving
a
dance
that
evening
and
while
the
girls
sat
in
the
long
sitting
room
waiting
for
the
guests
to
arrive
judy
took
occasion
to
whisper
to
molly
why
should
she
have
to
appear
at
the
lecture
anyhow
because
it
would
be
disrespectful
not
to
answered
molly
she
must
be
there
of
course
would
you
go
gallivanting
off
with
a
young
man
if
your
mother
was
going
to
give
a
lecture
here
i
should
say
not
but
that
different
no
no
persisted
molly
it
never
different
when
it
your
mother
even
when
she
does
behave
like
one
ca
you
see
that
nance
would
rather
die
than
have
people
know
that
her
mother
is
exactly
like
other
mothers
the
next
day
was
one
of
the
busiest
in
the
week
for
molly
two
of
her
morning
hours
she
spent
coaching
judy
in
latin
then
there
were
her
lace
collars
to
be
done
up
her
stockings
to
be
darned
a
trip
to
be
made
to
the
library
where
she
stood
in
line
for
more
than
twenty
minutes
waiting
for
a
certain
volume
of
the
encyclop√¶dia
britannica
and
spent
more
than
an
hour
extracting
notes
on
norse
mythology
it
was
well
on
toward
lunch
time
when
she
finally
hastened
across
the
campus
to
to
fill
some
orders
for
which
were
intended
to
be
part
of
the
refreshments
for
certain
saturday
evening
suppers
so
weary
was
she
and
so
intent
on
getting
through
in
what
she
called
schedule
time
that
she
almost
ran
into
professor
edwin
green
before
she
even
recognized
him
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
she
exclaimed
a
wave
of
color
sweeping
over
her
pale
face
why
are
you
hurrying
so
fast
on
saturday
he
asked
pleasantly
you
ever
give
yourself
a
holiday
oh
yes
lots
of
them
she
answered
but
i
a
little
rushed
with
some
extra
duties
she
thought
of
the
which
must
be
made
and
packed
in
boxes
by
the
afternoon
you
are
overdoing
it
miss
brown
you
are
not
obeying
the
orders
when
i
see
you
there
i
shall
confront
you
in
his
presence
with
the
charge
of
disobedience
there
repeated
molly
certainly
have
you
forgotten
about
the
supper
but
i
not
invited
oh
yes
you
are
answered
the
professor
with
a
knowing
smile
you
probably
find
the
note
waiting
for
you
and
you
must
be
sure
and
come
because
the
mclean
are
real
characters
they
will
interest
you
i
am
sure
poor
nance
was
molly
first
thought
and
her
second
thought
was
if
her
mother
is
invited
out
to
dine
she
can
accept
her
face
brightened
at
this
and
without
knowing
it
she
smiled
molly
led
such
a
busy
concentrated
life
that
when
she
did
relax
for
a
few
moments
she
sometimes
seemed
and
inattentive
the
professor
was
looking
at
her
closely
you
are
pleased
at
being
asked
to
the
mclean
he
said
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
she
said
i
was
wondering
if
after
all
nance
could
arrange
to
go
of
course
she
be
invited
too
but
you
see
her
mother
is
to
be
here
is
oldham
the
suffragette
her
mother
he
asked
in
surprise
yes
oldham
is
to
dine
at
the
president
i
know
because
i
was
asked
to
meet
her
but
he
looked
at
her
very
hard
indeed
i
had
another
engagement
then
nance
can
go
is
it
beautiful
i
am
so
glad
molly
clasped
her
hands
joyously
professor
green
gave
her
such
a
beautiful
beaming
smile
that
it
fairly
transfigured
his
face
you
are
a
very
good
friend
miss
brown
he
said
gently
but
would
not
miss
oldham
rather
be
with
her
mother
that
is
in
case
the
president
should
invite
her
too
which
is
highly
probable
oh
i
hope
she
wo
you
see
nance
has
never
had
much
pleasure
with
young
people
and
it
was
difficult
to
explain
and
her
mother
she
hesitated
her
mother
being
the
most
famous
clubwoman
in
america
has
spent
much
time
at
home
is
that
it
well
yes
admitted
molly
in
fact
she
hardly
remembers
she
has
a
daughter
she
added
indignantly
and
then
bit
her
lip
feeling
that
she
was
bordering
on
disloyalty
the
professor
cleared
his
throat
and
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
he
was
really
very
to
be
so
old
so
you
have
set
your
heart
on
miss
oldham
going
to
the
supper
he
said
gravely
if
there
is
any
fun
going
judy
and
i
would
be
sorry
to
have
her
miss
it
she
answered
and
i
do
suppose
it
would
be
thrilling
to
dine
at
the
president
with
a
lot
of
learned
older
people
i
just
on
my
way
to
president
walker
now
pursued
the
professor
thoughtfully
in
fact
i
was
just
about
to
deliver
my
regrets
in
person
regarding
dinner
and
having
some
business
to
attend
to
with
miss
walker
i
thought
i
would
call
while
i
am
there
it
is
possible
well
in
fact
miss
brown
there
should
be
a
good
fairy
provided
by
providence
to
grant
all
unselfish
wishes
she
would
not
be
a
busy
fairy
by
any
means
i
am
afraid
except
when
she
hovered
around
you
good
morning
and
lifting
his
hat
the
professor
hastened
away
leaving
molly
in
a
state
of
perplexity
on
the
table
in
her
room
she
found
a
note
from
mclean
inviting
her
to
supper
that
evening
two
other
invitations
from
the
same
lady
were
handed
to
nance
and
judy
but
nance
was
at
that
moment
seated
at
her
desk
accepting
an
invitation
from
miss
walker
to
dine
there
with
her
mother
at
seven
she
was
writing
the
answer
very
carefully
and
slowly
in
her
best
handwriting
and
on
her
best
monogram
note
paper
do
you
think
that
good
enough
she
demanded
handing
the
note
to
molly
to
read
why
yes
answered
molly
looking
it
over
hastily
while
she
prepared
to
write
her
own
answer
to
mclean
and
then
she
threw
herself
into
the
business
of
just
as
the
lunch
gong
sounded
bridget
the
irish
waitress
at
president
walker
house
appeared
at
their
door
a
note
for
miss
oldham
she
said
and
the
president
says
no
answer
is
necessary
good
afternoon
they
be
waitin
lunch
if
i
make
haste
dear
miss
oldham
nance
read
aloud
have
just
learned
that
you
are
invited
to
a
young
people
supper
party
at
mclean
and
i
therefore
hasten
to
release
you
from
your
engagement
to
dine
with
me
your
mother
will
spare
you
i
am
sure
on
this
one
evening
and
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
yourself
with
your
friends
with
kindest
regards
believe
me
yours
k
walker
is
she
a
brick
cried
judy
dancing
around
the
room
and
clapping
her
hands
it
was
awfully
nice
of
her
said
nance
thoughtfully
i
wonder
how
she
knew
i
was
invited
to
the
mclean
some
good
fairy
must
have
told
her
answered
molly
half
to
herself
as
she
stirred
brown
sugar
into
a
saucepan
chapter
xvi
the
mclean
supper
nance
did
get
a
telegram
from
her
mother
that
afternoon
it
was
very
vague
about
trains
and
merely
said
arrive
in
wellington
about
two
this
afternoon
meet
me
mother
fortunately
the
girls
were
as
familiar
with
the
train
schedule
as
with
their
own
class
schedules
and
knew
exactly
what
train
she
meant
it
the
of
course
announced
judy
shall
we
go
down
with
you
to
meet
her
nance
why
yes
i
think
mother
would
like
that
very
much
answered
nance
pleased
with
the
idea
she
loves
attention
therefore
when
the
pulled
into
wellington
station
our
three
freshmen
together
with
margaret
wakefield
heading
a
deputation
from
the
freshman
suffrage
club
and
miss
bowles
teacher
in
higher
mathematics
were
waiting
on
the
platform
there
she
is
cried
nance
with
a
note
of
eagerness
in
her
voice
that
made
molly
heart
ache
they
all
moved
forward
to
meet
a
gaunt
woman
with
a
sallow
faded
complexion
and
a
nervous
manner
but
her
brilliant
clear
brown
eyes
offset
her
unprepossessing
appearance
glowing
with
intelligence
and
with
feverish
energy
they
flashed
their
message
to
the
world
like
two
mariner
lights
at
sea
and
those
who
caught
that
burning
glance
forgot
the
tired
face
and
distraught
manner
of
the
woman
of
clubs
how
are
you
my
dear
she
said
kissing
nance
quite
casually
without
noticing
where
the
kiss
was
going
to
land
and
scarcely
glancing
at
her
daughter
she
had
evidently
been
making
notes
on
the
trip
down
and
still
carried
a
pencil
and
some
scrap
paper
in
one
hand
while
the
other
grasped
her
suit
case
of
which
nance
promptly
relieved
her
she
shook
hands
cordially
with
miss
bowles
and
the
girls
whom
nance
introduced
searching
the
face
of
each
as
a
recruiting
officer
might
examine
applicants
for
the
army
then
they
all
climbed
into
the
bus
and
presently
she
plunged
into
a
discussion
with
miss
bowles
on
the
advance
of
the
suffrage
movement
in
england
and
america
and
this
is
the
woman
whispered
judy
to
molly
dramatically
who
has
spoken
before
legislatures
and
represented
the
suffrage
party
abroad
and
been
regent
of
colonial
dames
and
president
of
national
societies
for
the
purification
of
politics
and
and
lecturer
on
history
of
legislation
how
under
the
sun
can
you
remember
it
all
interrupted
molly
i
do
think
i
have
got
them
straight
answered
judy
but
they
all
sound
alike
anyhow
so
what
the
odds
molly
discreetly
took
herself
off
to
judy
room
that
afternoon
leaving
nance
and
her
mother
together
for
the
short
time
that
elapsed
before
the
lecture
was
to
begin
but
nance
soon
followed
them
mother
wants
to
be
alone
she
said
she
has
some
notes
to
look
over
and
she
has
never
read
her
mail
yet
by
the
way
you
are
not
going
to
the
lecture
are
you
of
course
we
are
answered
the
girls
in
the
same
breath
but
the
walk
that
can
be
postponed
until
answered
molly
promptly
the
boys
are
going
to
spend
the
night
at
the
mclean
you
know
thus
nance
happiness
was
all
arranged
for
by
her
two
devoted
friends
the
gymnasium
was
only
half
full
when
the
girls
escorted
the
most
distinguished
clubwoman
in
america
across
the
campus
and
into
the
great
hall
the
freshmen
had
turned
out
in
full
force
partly
to
do
honor
to
nance
and
partly
because
president
margaret
wakefield
had
been
talking
up
the
lecture
beforehand
miss
walker
and
others
of
the
faculty
were
there
and
in
a
far
gallery
seat
molly
caught
a
glimpse
of
professor
green
whose
glance
seemed
to
be
turned
unseeingly
in
her
direction
if
judy
and
molly
had
had
any
fears
as
to
how
the
member
of
clubs
was
going
to
conduct
herself
on
the
platform
all
doubts
were
soon
dispelled
after
the
introduction
made
by
the
president
the
lecturer
nervous
manner
entirely
disappeared
she
approached
the
front
of
the
platform
with
a
composure
marvelous
to
see
and
in
a
cultivated
trained
voice
not
her
everyday
voice
by
any
means
she
delivered
an
address
of
fervid
and
passionate
eloquence
a
plea
for
woman
rights
and
universal
suffrage
so
convincing
that
the
most
obstinate
anti
would
have
been
won
over
after
the
lecture
there
was
an
impromptu
reception
on
the
platform
then
tea
at
miss
bowles
room
and
at
last
home
to
dress
for
the
supper
parties
judy
and
molly
had
hastened
ahead
leaving
nance
to
tear
her
mother
from
her
circle
of
admirers
with
the
plea
that
she
would
be
too
late
at
twenty
minutes
before
seven
they
hurried
in
oldham
looking
so
frail
and
exhausted
that
it
hardly
seemed
possible
she
could
keep
up
while
her
poor
daughter
dashed
into
her
own
clothes
her
mother
sat
limp
and
inert
during
the
process
of
having
her
hair
beautifully
arranged
with
lightning
speed
by
the
deft
and
handy
judy
while
molly
gave
the
weary
woman
aromatic
spirits
of
ammonia
in
a
glass
of
water
and
presently
hooked
her
into
a
dinner
dress
which
was
really
very
handsome
of
black
lace
over
gray
satin
thank
you
my
dears
she
said
amiably
giving
an
glance
at
herself
in
the
glass
you
are
very
kind
i
am
sure
i
am
such
a
busy
woman
i
have
little
time
to
spare
for
beautifying
but
i
must
say
miss
kean
has
improved
my
appearance
by
that
high
arrangement
of
hair
they
were
surprised
that
she
remembered
judy
name
until
they
learned
from
nance
later
that
such
was
her
training
in
meeting
strangers
she
never
forgot
a
name
or
face
now
where
am
i
going
continued
the
famous
clubwoman
you
will
drop
me
there
you
say
you
are
going
somewhere
nance
yes
mother
answered
nance
patiently
it
was
the
third
time
she
had
told
her
mother
that
fact
at
last
they
got
her
and
and
at
exactly
two
minutes
past
seven
deposited
her
at
the
president
front
door
then
with
feelings
of
indescribable
relief
they
ran
gayly
across
the
campus
chattering
and
laughing
like
magpies
ten
minutes
later
they
were
seated
at
mclean
large
round
supper
table
professor
green
seated
just
opposite
nance
gave
her
happy
glowing
face
a
long
questioning
look
then
turning
to
molly
next
to
him
he
said
she
is
enjoying
it
is
she
yes
whispered
molly
thanks
to
you
good
fairy
but
the
wish
must
come
before
the
fairy
acts
so
that
after
all
one
is
far
more
important
than
the
other
he
replied
was
the
lecture
wonderful
asked
molly
very
remarkable
he
answered
women
like
that
should
take
to
the
platform
and
leave
families
to
other
women
to
rear
they
certainly
ca
do
both
said
molly
remembering
poor
outburst
the
afternoon
before
and
if
you
have
the
vote
went
on
the
professor
in
a
louder
voice
and
with
a
kind
of
mock
solemnity
what
will
you
do
with
it
they
pitch
all
the
men
out
of
office
professor
called
mclean
who
had
overheard
this
question
and
they
do
all
the
work
too
and
we
men
will
begin
to
enjoy
life
a
little
we
been
slaves
long
enough
i
for
the
emancipation
of
men
he
cried
and
woman
suffrage
is
the
only
way
to
bring
it
about
they
all
laughed
at
this
original
view
of
the
question
and
mclean
a
charming
woman
with
a
beautiful
scotch
accent
impossible
to
imitate
observed
my
dear
the
women
are
just
as
great
slaves
as
the
men
and
they
work
much
harder
if
only
you
knew
it
but
you
do
because
we
are
careful
to
conceal
it
there
are
few
women
who
do
not
wear
their
company
manners
in
the
presence
of
a
man
take
my
word
for
it
is
that
the
reason
you
are
always
so
charming
mrs
mclean
put
in
professor
green
but
i
suspect
you
have
only
company
manners
not
at
all
professor
young
andy
will
tell
you
that
i
can
be
rude
enough
at
times
andy
mclean
a
tall
youth
with
sandy
hair
and
a
thin
intelligent
face
was
too
deeply
engaged
in
conversation
at
that
moment
with
nance
to
hear
his
mother
speech
let
him
alone
he
busy
remarked
his
father
with
a
humorous
smile
there
an
old
song
we
sing
at
home
went
on
mclean
nae
luck
in
tha
hoose
when
the
gude
man
awa
but
it
should
be
the
gude
wife
for
if
ever
a
house
goes
to
sixes
and
sevens
it
is
my
own
house
when
i
leave
the
two
andys
and
take
ship
for
scotland
for
a
bit
of
a
visit
there
nae
luck
in
the
hoose
for
certain
and
glad
they
are
to
get
me
back
again
if
is
only
for
their
own
personal
comfort
hoity
toity
mother
exclaimed
the
doctor
we
joost
as
glad
to
have
you
for
your
ainsel
my
dear
now
is
it
so
then
laughed
the
gude
wife
well
that
satisfying
assurance
truly
they
found
the
doctor
and
his
wife
very
amusing
and
molly
liked
lawrence
upton
too
who
was
seated
on
her
other
side
he
was
a
typical
college
youth
tall
and
stalwart
his
brown
hair
brushed
back
in
a
pompadour
his
clear
ruddy
complexion
glowing
with
vigor
in
fact
he
was
one
of
the
leading
athletes
at
exmoor
and
had
won
a
championship
at
high
jumping
and
running
i
hope
we
have
some
dancing
after
dinner
miss
brown
he
said
i
hear
southern
girls
fairly
float
and
i
like
to
have
a
chance
to
find
it
out
i
afraid
you
be
disappointed
with
me
then
answered
molly
been
leading
at
most
of
the
college
dances
this
fall
and
it
ruination
to
good
dancing
you
know
a
leader
is
always
pulling
against
the
bit
like
a
badly
trained
horse
you
look
to
me
like
a
thoroughbred
miss
brown
said
the
gallant
youth
i
not
afraid
of
your
pulling
against
the
bit
there
some
dancing
after
dinner
in
the
mclean
long
while
mclean
herself
played
long
waltzes
on
the
piano
funny
hop
polkas
and
schottisches
of
antique
origin
they
enjoyed
it
immensely
however
fitting
barn
dances
to
the
schottisches
and
mazurkas
and
two
steps
to
the
polkas
twice
professor
green
engaged
molly
in
a
waltz
she
had
anticipated
that
his
dancing
would
be
as
as
the
music
but
to
her
surprise
she
found
him
thoroughly
up
to
date
in
fact
she
was
obliged
to
admit
that
the
professor
in
english
literature
danced
better
than
any
of
the
younger
men
at
mclean
that
night
it
was
really
the
most
delightful
evening
molly
had
spent
since
she
had
been
at
wellington
to
nance
it
was
the
most
delightful
evening
of
her
entire
life
and
judy
who
always
enjoyed
the
last
time
best
of
all
told
mclean
when
they
left
that
she
had
never
had
a
better
time
in
her
life
after
the
dance
they
sat
around
the
big
open
fire
roasting
chestnuts
while
mclean
sang
a
funny
song
called
wee
wullie
and
judy
followed
with
an
absurd
piece
on
the
piano
called
birdie
dead
in
schottische
time
which
sent
them
into
shrieks
of
laughter
and
amused
mclean
so
that
he
laid
his
head
on
his
wife
shoulder
and
wept
with
joy
sitting
in
the
inglenook
by
the
fireplace
professor
green
said
to
molly
i
have
been
waiting
to
say
something
to
you
miss
brown
and
i
will
ask
you
to
regard
it
as
confidential
she
looked
up
thinking
perhaps
it
was
the
comic
opera
he
was
going
to
talk
about
but
she
was
vastly
mistaken
when
as
botticelli
flora
you
came
to
that
night
with
the
words
saw
her
you
did
not
guess
did
you
that
i
too
had
seen
her
they
looked
at
each
other
and
a
flash
of
understanding
passed
between
them
they
now
shared
two
secrets
i
always
wanted
to
tell
you
he
continued
in
a
low
voice
how
much
i
admired
your
generous
silence
you
are
a
very
remarkable
young
woman
with
that
the
party
broke
up
later
stretching
her
long
slenderness
in
the
bed
beside
judy
molly
smiled
to
herself
and
decided
that
some
older
men
were
almost
as
nice
as
some
young
ones
chapter
xvii
a
midnight
adventure
just
about
this
time
a
new
figure
appeared
at
wellington
college
she
was
known
as
inspector
of
dormitories
and
her
office
was
mainly
sanitary
and
did
not
infringe
on
the
duties
of
the
matrons
the
new
inspector
lodged
at
queen
since
there
was
an
empty
room
in
that
establishment
and
her
name
was
miss
steel
if
she
had
had
her
choice
of
all
the
names
in
the
english
language
she
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
suitable
one
remarked
judy
who
had
taken
a
violent
dislike
to
miss
steel
from
the
first
she
was
indeed
a
person
steely
eyes
hair
pale
thin
lips
and
at
her
belt
metallic
chains
from
which
jangled
notebook
and
pencil
when
she
spoke
which
was
rarely
her
voice
was
sharp
and
incisive
and
cut
the
air
like
a
knife
but
her
most
objectionable
quality
the
girls
thought
was
that
she
never
made
any
sound
when
she
walked
the
reason
being
that
she
had
rubber
heels
on
her
shoes
the
first
real
encounter
the
girls
had
with
miss
steel
was
at
a
thanksgiving
eve
spread
given
by
the
combined
society
most
of
the
members
having
received
bountiful
thanksgiving
boxes
from
home
nance
neglected
and
lonely
father
had
sent
her
a
box
of
candy
in
lieu
of
the
usual
box
which
takes
a
woman
to
plan
and
pack
and
judy
devoted
parents
always
on
the
fly
had
shipped
her
a
box
of
fruit
all
the
others
had
received
regular
boxes
full
of
thanksgiving
cheer
and
the
feast
was
to
be
a
grand
one
each
member
invited
guests
and
by
general
vote
extra
ones
were
asked
frances
andrews
who
declined
because
she
was
going
away
and
two
freshmen
who
lived
in
the
village
and
were
working
their
way
through
college
judith
blount
was
to
be
there
by
invitation
of
pretty
jessie
lynch
and
molly
had
invited
mary
stewart
most
of
the
girls
wore
fancy
costumes
and
molly
and
nance
large
room
was
the
scene
of
an
extravaganza
the
feast
was
piled
on
four
study
tables
placed
in
an
unbroken
row
and
covered
with
a
white
cloth
jessie
had
worn
her
famous
ballet
costume
and
was
as
pretty
as
a
little
captive
sprite
judith
was
in
a
gorgeous
turkish
dress
consisting
of
full
yellow
silk
trousers
a
tunic
of
transparent
net
and
embroidered
turkish
slippers
nance
wore
her
scotch
costume
and
at
the
last
minute
molly
who
had
been
too
busy
even
to
think
of
a
costume
all
day
dressed
herself
up
charmingly
like
a
tyrolean
peasant
in
what
she
could
collect
from
the
other
girls
a
great
many
of
the
guests
had
arrived
and
the
room
was
filled
when
a
chambermaid
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
a
tray
of
cards
some
gentlemen
to
call
miss
she
said
endeavoring
not
to
smile
at
a
little
boy
blue
and
a
little
lord
fauntleroy
who
were
waltzing
together
there
were
four
cards
on
the
tray
edwin
green
george
theodore
green
andrew
mclean
and
lawrence
upton
well
of
all
the
strange
times
to
pay
a
call
exclaimed
molly
will
you
say
that
we
are
very
sorry
but
we
must
be
excused
this
evening
she
said
to
the
maid
the
servant
bowed
and
slipped
away
while
all
the
girls
in
the
room
pounced
on
the
cards
well
i
never
four
beaux
and
one
of
them
a
professor
cried
jessie
showing
the
cards
to
judith
miss
brown
could
hardly
claim
cousin
edwin
as
a
beau
said
judith
her
black
eyes
snapping
his
younger
brother
george
often
drags
him
into
things
and
poor
cousin
edwin
consents
to
go
because
george
is
so
timid
but
as
for
paying
a
social
call
on
a
freshman
even
the
most
freshman
could
hardly
regard
a
visit
from
him
as
that
i
do
regard
it
as
that
ejaculated
molly
she
was
not
accustomed
to
people
and
it
was
really
difficult
for
her
to
deal
with
them
properly
as
judy
could
and
nance
too
but
she
forced
herself
to
remember
that
judith
was
a
guest
in
her
room
and
was
about
to
partake
of
some
of
her
good
kentucky
fare
she
turned
away
without
saying
another
word
and
fortunately
the
maid
came
back
just
then
and
relieved
the
strained
situation
the
gentlemen
say
they
must
see
you
she
said
and
if
you
wo
come
down
to
them
they
just
come
upstairs
what
cried
a
chorus
of
girls
suddenly
there
was
a
wild
scramble
on
the
stairs
shouts
of
laughter
a
sound
of
heavy
boots
thumping
along
the
hall
and
four
tall
young
men
burst
into
the
room
there
were
shrieks
from
disappearing
boy
blues
and
fauntleroys
who
endeavored
to
cover
their
extremities
with
sofa
cushions
the
captive
sprite
rushed
into
a
closet
and
a
wild
scene
of
disorder
and
pandemonium
followed
do
be
frightened
ladies
said
the
tallest
young
man
who
wore
correct
evening
clothes
from
his
opera
hat
and
pearl
studs
to
his
pointed
patent
leather
pumps
his
hair
was
light
and
curly
and
he
had
a
long
yellow
mustache
like
lord
dundreary
ladies
ladies
why
all
this
excitement
called
another
of
the
quartette
dressed
in
full
black
and
white
checked
trousers
a
short
tan
overcoat
a
red
tie
and
a
brown
derby
the
third
young
man
wore
a
smoking
jacket
and
white
duck
trousers
and
the
fourth
was
dressed
in
an
english
golf
suit
and
visored
cap
oh
you
villains
cried
jessica
popping
her
head
out
of
the
closet
you
have
frightened
us
almost
to
death
do
you
think
i
would
know
you
margaret
wakefield
even
in
that
sporting
suit
come
over
here
and
show
yourself
the
bogus
gentlemen
were
indeed
three
of
the
evening
hostesses
and
one
of
the
guests
mary
stewart
wore
the
evening
clothes
borrowed
from
her
brother
for
a
senior
play
to
take
place
shortly
judy
had
on
the
golf
suit
sallie
marks
the
dinner
coat
and
margaret
the
rakish
sporting
costume
but
where
did
you
get
the
cards
asked
judith
ashamed
of
herself
now
that
the
visitors
real
identity
was
disclosed
i
wrote
to
dodo
and
asked
him
for
them
answered
judy
giving
her
a
look
as
much
as
to
say
what
affair
is
it
of
yours
after
the
banquet
was
commenced
and
the
fun
waxed
fast
and
furious
there
was
a
cakewalk
at
the
last
with
a
box
of
as
the
prize
the
eight
hostesses
taking
turns
as
judges
after
this
wild
orgy
i
think
we
better
be
leaving
said
mary
stewart
it
getting
cold
and
late
but
we
had
a
glorious
time
will
you
permit
a
gentleman
to
kiss
you
on
the
cheek
molly
that
i
will
answered
molly
and
proud
of
the
honor
slipping
on
a
skirt
and
a
long
ulster
mary
took
her
departure
with
judith
and
the
other
girls
who
did
not
have
rooms
at
queen
and
pretty
soon
the
party
had
disbanded
i
stay
and
help
you
gather
up
the
loaves
and
fishes
judy
announced
it
soon
be
ten
but
we
can
hang
a
dressing
gown
over
the
transom
and
draw
the
blinds
and
no
one
will
know
the
difference
just
this
once
she
added
proceeding
to
carry
out
her
ideas
of
deception
i
still
hungry
observed
nance
i
had
to
wait
on
so
many
people
i
did
have
a
chance
to
eat
any
supper
myself
so
am
i
famished
said
molly
but
i
was
ashamed
to
confess
it
i
like
a
cup
of
hot
tea
observed
judy
who
had
waited
on
nobody
but
herself
when
markham
comes
around
cautioned
nance
in
case
she
knocks
on
the
door
one
of
us
be
ready
to
put
out
the
light
judy
you
slip
into
the
closet
she
been
known
to
come
in
you
know
after
one
of
these
jamborees
markham
away
answered
judy
beads
is
taking
her
place
until
after
thanksgiving
the
girls
munched
their
sandwiches
and
talked
in
low
voices
suddenly
there
was
a
sharp
rap
on
the
door
instantly
the
light
went
out
and
there
was
dead
silence
judy
crawling
on
all
fours
toward
the
closet
was
about
to
conceal
herself
behind
protecting
skirts
when
the
rap
was
repeated
well
what
is
it
called
nance
the
boldest
among
them
the
light
is
out
there
was
no
answer
and
the
rap
was
not
repeated
the
girls
waited
a
few
moments
and
then
cautiously
lighting
a
lamp
with
a
green
shade
proceeded
with
their
supper
judy
looked
at
her
watch
it
was
a
quarter
of
eleven
again
they
were
interrupted
this
time
by
some
pebbles
thrown
against
the
window
molly
raised
the
sash
softly
and
gazed
down
into
the
darkness
below
what
is
it
she
called
it
margaret
answered
a
voice
from
the
yard
for
the
love
of
heaven
ca
you
let
me
in
i
explain
afterward
i
would
mind
ringing
up
markham
but
i
afraid
of
that
steel
woman
wait
a
minute
answered
molly
and
closing
the
window
she
turned
to
consult
with
the
others
there
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
go
down
they
decided
and
molly
insisted
on
being
the
sacrificial
lamb
judy
made
her
slip
on
her
nightgown
over
her
dress
and
her
dressing
gown
over
that
in
order
to
appear
in
the
proper
guise
in
case
anything
happened
but
they
were
doomed
to
another
shock
that
night
just
as
molly
opened
the
door
she
came
face
to
face
with
miss
steel
standing
outside
in
the
hall
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
said
molly
politely
feeling
thankful
she
had
put
on
her
nightgown
i
thought
i
heard
a
noise
outside
you
seem
to
be
sitting
up
very
late
miss
brown
said
miss
steel
looking
at
her
coldly
i
was
told
to
enforce
the
ten
rule
in
markham
absence
and
i
must
ask
you
to
get
to
bed
at
once
unless
you
wish
to
be
reported
i
sorry
said
molly
the
woman
seemed
unnecessarily
stern
she
thought
because
after
all
this
was
not
a
boarding
school
but
a
college
however
she
went
back
and
closed
and
bolted
the
door
in
her
heart
she
felt
a
contempt
for
any
one
who
would
creep
about
and
listen
at
people
doors
markham
would
have
been
incapable
of
it
just
then
there
came
another
pebble
against
the
window
judy
crept
to
the
window
this
time
wait
margaret
she
called
miss
steel
is
about
there
was
perfect
stillness
for
several
long
black
minutes
the
three
girls
sat
in
a
row
on
the
floor
listening
with
strained
ears
and
to
judy
at
least
the
adventure
was
not
without
its
enjoyment
at
last
they
felt
that
it
might
be
safe
to
act
taking
off
their
shoes
they
moved
noiselessly
to
the
window
and
looked
down
there
stood
the
courageous
margaret
in
full
view
on
the
roof
of
the
piazza
she
had
actually
shinned
up
one
of
the
pillars
which
was
not
such
a
difficult
feat
as
it
might
seem
as
the
railing
around
the
piazza
had
placed
her
within
reach
of
the
wooden
grillwork
and
swinging
onto
that
she
had
drawn
herself
up
to
the
roof
she
had
skinned
her
wrist
and
stumped
one
of
her
stockinged
toes
having
removed
her
shoes
and
hidden
them
under
the
house
but
she
appeared
now
the
very
figure
of
courage
and
action
waiting
for
the
next
move
the
three
girls
stood
looking
down
at
her
in
a
state
of
fearful
uncertainty
as
to
what
should
be
done
next
and
as
if
this
were
not
exciting
enough
three
light
telegraphic
taps
were
heard
on
the
door
that
not
miss
steel
whispered
judy
who
is
it
she
called
softly
through
the
keyhole
jessie
came
the
answer
instantly
the
door
was
opened
and
jessie
crept
in
miss
steel
is
up
she
whispered
i
saw
her
on
the
landing
below
just
now
be
careful
i
am
scared
to
death
because
margaret
has
come
back
for
an
answer
they
led
her
to
the
window
and
pointed
to
the
shadowy
figure
of
her
roommate
on
the
piazza
roof
because
molly
had
conceived
a
dislike
and
distrust
for
miss
steel
she
made
up
her
mind
to
outwit
her
and
save
her
friend
she
reflected
that
if
margaret
tried
any
of
the
girls
on
the
second
floor
whose
windows
opened
on
the
roof
she
might
get
in
but
she
would
still
have
the
third
flight
to
make
and
as
the
stairs
creaked
at
every
step
it
would
be
a
difficult
matter
fortunately
miss
steel
room
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
i
have
a
scheme
she
whispered
at
last
now
do
any
one
move
i
can
manage
it
without
making
a
sound
there
was
a
ball
of
twine
on
the
mantelpiece
thank
heavens
for
that
she
tied
one
end
to
the
back
of
a
cane
chair
which
she
let
slowly
out
of
the
window
then
snipping
off
the
end
of
the
cord
she
gave
it
to
nance
to
hold
another
chair
which
was
fortunately
smaller
she
let
down
in
the
same
way
and
finally
a
stool
margaret
placed
one
on
top
of
the
other
mounted
the
precarious
and
toppling
pyramid
and
with
the
strength
of
arm
and
wrist
which
showed
her
gymnasium
training
pulled
herself
to
the
window
sill
and
was
in
the
room
be
quiet
they
whispered
miss
steel
is
about
the
four
girls
lay
down
on
the
couches
and
waited
a
long
time
judy
really
fell
asleep
in
the
interval
before
they
dared
risk
pulling
back
the
chairs
it
was
in
fact
a
risky
business
and
had
to
be
done
cautiously
and
carefully
to
keep
them
from
bumping
against
the
walls
of
the
house
at
last
however
the
whole
thing
was
accomplished
margaret
explained
that
she
had
gone
over
to
one
of
the
other
houses
to
return
the
clothes
she
had
borrowed
and
had
joined
another
thanksgiving
party
and
stayed
longer
than
she
had
intended
they
also
had
been
held
up
by
the
matron
and
had
been
obliged
to
put
out
the
lights
and
hide
everything
under
the
bed
she
had
escaped
from
the
house
by
a
miracle
without
being
found
out
and
had
trusted
to
luck
and
her
friends
for
getting
into
queen
unobserved
and
now
at
last
the
adventure
was
almost
over
after
another
interminable
wait
judy
and
margaret
and
jessie
crept
off
to
their
rooms
judy
door
was
still
ajar
when
she
saw
a
flash
of
light
on
the
stairs
which
heralded
the
approach
of
miss
steel
still
fully
clothed
and
walking
noiselessly
as
usual
judy
closed
her
door
and
locked
it
softly
only
a
spy
would
wear
felt
slippers
she
said
to
herself
scornfully
then
she
laughed
it
was
rather
good
fun
to
be
sure
but
would
it
have
mattered
so
much
after
all
if
margaret
had
boldly
come
in
at
the
front
door
and
explained
they
would
never
have
gone
to
all
that
trouble
to
deceive
nice
markham
her
thoughts
continued
as
she
removed
her
manly
attire
but
miss
steel
was
different
as
for
molly
her
thoughts
were
about
the
same
as
judy
a
lady
does
creep
she
was
thinking
as
she
thankfully
crawled
into
bed
a
lady
does
listen
at
doors
or
wear
soundless
slippers
in
order
to
walk
like
a
cat
no
miss
steel
is
decidedly
not
a
lady
and
when
molly
came
to
this
decision
about
a
person
she
avoided
them
carefully
ever
afterward
her
definition
of
a
lady
was
about
the
same
as
a
man
definition
of
a
gentleman
it
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
birth
or
education

as
the
football
game
and
was
in
fact
a
grand
burlesque
on
a
game
played
not
long
before
between
two
university
teams
quite
half
of
the
wellington
students
took
part
in
the
affair
and
those
who
were
not
actively
engaged
were
placed
in
the
cheer
sections
to
yell
themselves
hoarse
there
were
a
dozen
doctors
an
ambulance
stretcher
bearers
trained
nurses
and
the
two
teams
in
proper
football
attire
everybody
in
college
turned
out
one
saturday
afternoon
to
witness
this
elaborate
parody
a
coach
drove
over
from
exmoor
fairly
alive
with
students
and
the
fields
outside
the
wellington
athletic
grounds
were
black
with
people
judy
was
a
member
of
the
corps
of
physicians
who
were
all
dressed
alike
in
frock
coats
reaching
well
below
the
knees
gray
trousers
and
silk
hats
they
had
imposing
mustaches
carried
bags
of
instruments
and
were
the
most
ludicrous
of
all
the
actors
that
day
but
it
was
the
stretcher
bearers
who
seemed
to
excite
the
greatest
merriment
in
the
grand
parade
which
took
place
before
the
game
began
they
were
dressed
something
like
slivers
the
famous
clown
in
full
white
pantaloons
and
long
white
coats
cut
in
at
the
waist
with
wide
skirts
the
members
of
the
cheering
sections
which
headed
the
grand
column
were
dressed
in
every
sort
of
absurd
burlesque
of
a
college
clothes
that
could
be
devised
how
they
ever
collected
all
those
ridiculous
costumes
is
a
marvel
to
me
exclaimed
president
walker
to
mclean
whose
face
had
turned
an
apoplectic
purple
from
laughter
and
who
occasionally
let
out
a
roar
of
joy
that
could
be
heard
all
the
way
across
the
field
following
the
cheering
sections
in
the
parade
were
the
two
teams
hardly
recognizable
at
all
as
human
beings
their
wigs
of
tousled
hair
stood
out
all
over
their
heads
like
the
petals
of
enormous
chrysanthemums
most
of
them
wore
nose
guards
or
their
faces
were
made
up
in
a
savage
and
barbaric
fashion
in
their
wadded
football
suits
stuffed
out
of
all
human
recognition
they
resembled
trussed
fowls
in
the
vanguard
of
this
strange
and
ludicrous
procession
stalked
a
gigantic
figure
of
liberty
she
was
about
fifteen
feet
high
and
her
draperies
reached
to
the
ground
her
long
red
hair
blew
in
the
breezes
and
she
carried
a
wellington
banner
which
she
majestically
waved
over
the
heads
of
the
multitude
by
her
side
ran
a
dwarf
they
were
the
mascots
of
the
two
sides
why
if
that
is
our
little
friend
miss
molly
brown
exclaimed
mclean
pointing
to
liberty
she
a
bonnie
lass
and
a
sweet
one
think
now
of
her
being
able
to
walk
on
those
sticks
without
losing
her
balance
it
a
verra
great
achievement
i
thinking
for
a
young
woman
for
they
all
at
seventeen
or
thereabouts
it
was
indeed
molly
the
only
girl
in
all
wellington
who
could
walk
on
stilts
the
seniors
had
advertised
in
for
a
stiltswoman
and
molly
had
promptly
offered
her
services
jessie
had
been
selected
as
the
dwarf
i
hope
the
child
wo
fall
and
break
her
neck
said
mclean
on
the
other
side
of
the
doctor
it
verra
dangerous
suppose
she
should
become
suddenly
faint
do
suppose
anything
of
the
sort
mither
you
no
grounds
for
thinkin
the
lass
will
tumble
she
seems
to
be
at
home
in
the
air
professor
green
just
beyond
mclean
frowned
and
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
wondered
if
mclean
had
forgotten
that
he
had
been
sent
for
just
three
weeks
before
when
molly
had
fainted
in
the
gymnasium
and
the
professor
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
liberty
presently
descended
to
the
earth
and
the
game
began
it
was
one
of
the
bloodiest
and
roughest
games
in
the
history
of
football
the
ambulance
bell
rang
constantly
every
time
a
victim
fell
the
cheering
section
on
the
other
side
set
up
a
wild
yell
doctors
and
nurses
were
scattered
all
about
the
edges
of
the
field
attending
to
the
wounded
and
the
stretchers
were
busy
every
minute
as
fast
as
one
man
tumbled
another
jumped
into
his
place
and
at
last
when
there
came
a
touchdown
the
players
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
top
of
each
other
in
a
mad
squirming
mass
people
laughed
that
day
who
were
rarely
seen
to
smile
even
miss
severe
expression
relaxed
into
a
cold
steely
smile
molly
had
gathered
up
her
long
cheesecloth
robe
and
was
sitting
with
jessie
on
a
bench
at
the
side
of
the
field
is
it
perfect
jessie
she
was
saying
i
do
think
i
ever
enjoyed
anything
so
much
in
all
my
life
it
will
make
a
wonderful
letter
home
jessie
smiled
absently
with
a
pair
of
field
glasses
she
was
searching
the
faces
of
the
spectators
for
two
friends
men
of
course
who
had
motored
over
to
see
the
sport
at
her
belt
was
pinned
the
most
enormous
bunch
of
violets
ever
seen
in
fact
they
were
two
bunches
worn
as
one
from
her
two
admirers
presently
judith
joined
them
on
the
bench
ever
since
the
thanksgiving
spread
she
had
endeavored
to
be
very
nice
to
molly
hello
called
jessie
you
are
a
sight
i
know
it
she
said
i
feel
that
i
am
a
disgrace
to
the
sex
i
only
hope
i
not
recognizable
your
shiny
black
eye
is
the
only
familiar
thing
about
you
the
rest
is
entirely
disguised
i
think
i
recognize
that
ring
miss
blount
put
in
molly
almost
everybody
knows
that
emerald
by
sight
now
who
knows
you
at
all
judith
glanced
quickly
at
her
finger
do
you
know
she
exclaimed
i
forgot
i
was
wearing
it
how
stupid
of
me
i
am
booked
to
take
rosamond
place
in
a
minute
will
one
of
you
girls
take
care
of
it
for
me
i
shall
be
much
obliged
you
better
take
it
jessie
said
molly
looking
rather
doubtfully
at
the
ring
she
had
only
one
piece
of
jewelry
to
her
name
a
string
of
sapphires
which
had
belonged
to
her
mother
when
she
was
a
girl
but
the
ring
was
too
big
for
jessie
slender
pretty
little
fingers
i
ca
she
said
unless
i
wear
it
on
my
thumb
and
it
might
slip
off
you
know
you
have
to
take
it
molly
molly
slipped
it
on
her
finger
and
held
it
up
for
admiration
it
the
most
beautiful
ring
i
ever
saw
she
exclaimed
it
the
color
of
deep
green
sea
water
not
that
i
ever
saw
any
but
i
heard
tell
of
it
she
added
laughing
you
do
mean
to
say
you
have
never
seen
the
ocean
cried
judith
in
a
pleasant
tone
of
voice
molly
had
never
seen
her
so
amiable
before
no
replied
the
freshman
this
is
the
nearest
i
have
ever
been
to
it
well
thanks
for
taking
care
of
my
ring
went
on
judith
i
see
you
after
the
game
and
she
departed
to
take
up
her
duties
on
the
field
just
as
rosamond
at
the
appointed
time
with
a
gash
across
her
face
made
with
salve
was
borne
from
the
field
on
a
stretcher
after
the
game
came
another
grand
procession
in
which
all
the
wounded
took
part
molly
on
stilts
with
jessie
running
beside
her
as
before
all
that
morning
molly
had
felt
buoyed
up
by
the
fun
and
excitement
of
the
great
burlesque
but
now
that
the
game
was
over
as
she
strode
along
on
the
giant
stilts
she
began
to
feel
the
same
overpowering
fatigue
she
had
experienced
that
night
at
the
living
picture
show
for
a
week
she
had
been
living
on
her
nerves
often
at
night
she
had
not
slept
but
had
tossed
about
on
her
bed
trying
to
recall
her
lessons
or
make
mental
notes
of
things
she
intended
to
do
on
cold
mornings
her
feet
and
hands
were
numb
and
dead
and
judy
often
made
her
run
across
the
campus
and
back
to
start
her
circulation
and
now
that
numbness
began
to
climb
from
her
toes
straight
up
her
body
molly
turned
unsteadily
and
with
shaky
strides
at
least
six
feet
long
hastened
across
the
field
her
feeling
that
she
must
get
out
of
the
noise
and
turmoil
away
from
everybody
in
the
world
carried
her
back
of
a
row
of
sheds
under
which
the
players
sat
during
the
intermissions
once
in
this
quiet
place
she
let
herself
down
from
the
stilts
she
was
conscious
of
being
very
cold
there
was
a
deep
red
light
in
the
western
sky
from
the
setting
sun
then
the
numbness
reached
her
brain
and
she
remembered
nothing
more
until
she
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
mclean
at
one
side
of
her
and
professor
green
at
the
other
here
she
comes
back
at
last
exclaimed
the
doctor
aye
lass
it
a
good
thing
this
young
man
has
an
observant
eye
otherwise
ye
might
have
been
lying
out
here
in
the
cold
all
night
you
feel
better
now
you
yes
doctor
answered
molly
weakly
i
do
like
these
fainting
spells
my
lass
you
not
made
of
iron
child
you
have
to
give
up
one
thing
or
study
or
play
but
there
were
other
things
molly
did
beside
studying
and
playing
of
course
the
doctor
did
not
know
about
the
and
the
and
the
tutoring
aye
here
comes
one
of
my
associates
with
a
carriage
he
went
on
chuckling
to
himself
shall
we
have
a
consultation
now
dr
kean
judy
still
in
her
absurd
burlesque
costume
had
driven
up
in
one
of
the
village
surreys
as
the
two
men
lifted
molly
into
the
back
seat
she
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
wearing
a
man
overcoat
it
was
dark
blue
and
felt
warm
and
comfortable
she
slipped
her
hands
into
the
deep
pockets
and
snuggled
down
into
its
folds
certainly
she
felt
shivery
about
the
spine
and
her
hands
and
feet
which
were
never
known
to
be
warm
were
now
like
lumps
of
ice
as
the
doctor
was
still
wearing
his
great
coat
of
scotch
tweed
it
was
evidently
the
coat
of
the
professor
of
english
literature
she
had
appropriated
it
awfully
good
of
you
to
lend
me
your
coat
she
said
to
professor
green
who
was
standing
at
the
side
of
the
carriage
while
the
doctor
climbed
in
beside
her
i
afraid
you
take
cold
without
it
nonsense
he
said
almost
gruffly
i
not
dressed
in
cheesecloth
but
i
have
on
a
white
sweater
under
all
this
said
molly
timidly
the
carriage
drove
away
however
without
his
saying
another
word
and
later
that
afternoon
after
molly
had
taken
a
nap
and
felt
rested
and
refreshed
she
engaged
one
of
the
maids
at
queen
cottage
to
return
professor
green
overcoat
with
a
message
of
thanks
then
with
a
sigh
of
relief
because
when
she
had
borrowed
anything
it
always
weighed
heavily
on
her
mind
and
because
she
felt
somehow
that
the
professor
was
provoked
with
her
she
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
again
just
as
the
clock
in
the
chapel
tower
sounded
midnight
she
sat
up
in
bed
what
is
it
molly
dear
asked
nance
who
was
wakeful
and
uneasy
about
her
friend
molly
was
looking
at
her
right
hand
wildly
the
ring
she
cried
judith
emerald
ring
it
gone
the
ring
was
indeed
gone
neither
of
her
friends
had
seen
it
on
her
finger
since
she
had
been
in
her
room
it
was
gone
lost
it
must
have
slipped
off
my
finger
when
i
fainted
sobbed
the
poor
girl
nance
had
summoned
judy
at
this
trying
crisis
and
the
two
girls
endeavored
to
comfort
their
friend
who
seemed
to
be
working
herself
into
a
state
of
feverish
excitement
never
mind
we
find
it
in
the
morning
molly
cried
nance
you
know
exactly
where
it
was
you
fell
do
you
somewhere
behind
the
sheds
it
sure
to
be
there
judy
and
i
promise
to
go
there
first
thing
do
we
judy
yes
indeed
acquiesced
judy
who
loved
her
morning
sleep
better
than
anything
in
life
but
judy
was
learning
unselfishness
since
she
had
been
associating
with
molly
and
nance
there
was
no
more
sleep
for
poor
molly
that
night
however
and
she
lay
through
the
dragging
hours
with
strained
nerves
and
throbbing
temples
wondering
what
would
happen
if
she
did
not
find
the
ring
chapter
xix
three
friends
nance
was
still
sound
asleep
when
molly
crept
from
her
bed
and
dressed
herself
it
was
a
dismal
cold
morning
a
fine
snow
was
falling
and
she
shivered
as
she
tied
a
scarf
around
her
head
threw
her
long
gray
eiderdown
cape
over
her
shoulders
and
slipped
from
the
room
without
waking
her
friend
who
was
weary
after
the
excitements
of
the
day
before
across
the
campus
she
hastened
anxiety
lending
swiftness
to
her
steps
and
at
last
reached
the
athletic
field
at
the
far
end
snuggled
several
low
wooden
sheds
like
a
group
of
animals
trying
to
keep
warm
by
staying
close
together
i
must
hurry
molly
thought
or
the
snow
will
be
so
thick
i
shall
never
be
able
to
find
the
ring
and
summoning
all
her
energy
she
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
straight
to
the
spot
where
she
remembered
to
have
dropped
the
day
before
behind
the
sheds
breathless
and
tingling
all
over
with
little
prickly
chills
she
knelt
down
and
began
to
search
in
the
dead
grass
brushing
the
snow
away
as
she
hunted
she
had
not
stopped
to
find
gloves
neither
had
she
wasted
any
time
lacing
her
boots
but
had
slipped
on
some
pumps
at
the
side
of
the
bed
for
a
long
time
molly
searched
every
inch
of
the
ground
back
of
the
sheds
where
she
might
have
been
then
with
an
feeling
of
desperation
she
hunted
in
the
field
itself
across
which
she
had
followed
the
parade
and
it
was
here
that
judy
and
nance
found
her
so
absorbed
in
her
search
that
she
had
not
even
noticed
their
approach
oh
molly
molly
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
you
cried
nance
seizing
her
by
the
arm
impulsively
you
kill
yourself
by
your
imprudence
why
did
you
wait
and
let
us
look
molly
opened
her
mouth
to
answer
and
the
words
came
out
in
a
husky
whisper
she
had
entirely
lost
her
voice
from
hoarseness
without
even
knowing
that
she
had
caught
cold
i
looked
everywhere
she
whispered
and
i
have
found
it
i
could
have
lost
it
while
i
was
on
the
stilts
because
i
never
let
go
of
them
for
a
moment
it
must
have
been
when
i
fainted
judy
you
take
her
home
while
i
look
again
volunteered
nance
take
her
to
the
infirmary
you
mean
answered
judy
and
she
promptly
led
molly
by
a
short
cut
toward
the
last
house
on
the
far
side
of
the
campus
where
stood
the
small
college
hospital
molly
obediently
allowed
herself
to
be
piloted
along
her
cheeks
were
burning
there
was
a
feverish
light
in
her
eyes
and
she
no
longer
felt
cold
at
all
but
hot
all
over
with
little
chills
along
her
spine
i
afraid
i
a
great
nuisance
judy
dear
i
hope
you
forgive
me
but
i
really
in
great
trouble
she
said
huskily
as
judy
confided
her
to
one
of
the
two
nurses
at
the
hospital
do
worry
was
judy
parting
command
we
find
the
ring
it
ca
possibly
be
lost
utterly
it
too
big
and
green
i
see
judith
blount
too
some
one
may
have
found
it
and
returned
it
to
her
by
this
time
i
leave
a
notice
on
the
bulletin
board
and
stand
my
little
joseph
on
his
head
she
added
laughing
you
may
be
sure
i
leave
nothing
undone
to
find
that
old
ring
the
first
thing
judy
did
after
breakfast
that
sunday
morning
was
to
pay
a
visit
to
judith
blount
there
was
a
placard
on
her
door
announcing
to
whom
it
might
concern
that
judith
was
busy
and
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
but
judy
knocked
boldly
and
at
an
impatient
who
is
it
replied
i
wish
to
see
you
on
important
business
please
unlock
the
door
judy
could
make
out
why
judith
blount
looked
so
white
and
uneasy
when
she
entered
the
room
nor
why
her
expression
changed
to
one
of
intense
relief
a
moment
later
i
came
to
ask
you
began
judy
abruptly
if
any
one
had
found
your
emerald
ring
miss
brown
has
my
ring
answered
judith
promptly
did
you
know
that
molly
had
fainted
and
is
now
ill
in
the
hospital
and
the
ring
is
lost
my
emerald
ring
lost
judith
almost
shouted
do
carry
on
so
about
it
put
in
judy
it
be
found
molly
herself
was
up
at
dawn
this
morning
she
stole
away
before
anybody
could
stop
her
and
went
to
the
field
to
look
for
it
but
she
has
been
able
to
find
it
and
neither
has
nance
who
looked
for
it
later
nance
has
gone
down
to
the
village
to
find
the
surrey
that
took
molly
home
we
are
all
doing
everything
we
can
and
in
the
meantime
i
thought
i
would
tell
you
so
that
you
could
help
us
judy
could
be
very
impudent
when
she
wanted
to
and
she
was
impudent
now
as
she
stood
looking
straight
into
judith
angry
black
eyes
she
should
have
been
more
careful
burst
out
judith
in
a
rage
how
do
i
know
that
she
stopped
frightened
at
what
she
was
about
to
say
better
not
say
that
said
judy
calmly
it
simply
would
go
you
know
and
you
must
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
it
would
be
absolutely
false
how
do
you
know
what
i
was
going
to
say
i
could
guess
said
judy
shrugging
her
shoulders
i
can
often
guess
things
you
would
like
to
say
but
do
miss
blount
what
i
came
for
was
to
ask
you
to
help
us
find
the
ring
molly
is
very
ill
and
of
course
it
the
loss
of
the
ring
as
much
as
anything
else
that
made
her
so
we
all
doing
the
best
we
can
and
if
you
just
kindly
add
your
efforts
to
ours
it
might
help
some
supposing
the
ring
is
found
what
redress
have
i
it
been
in
our
family
for
generations
it
was
brought
over
from
france
by
a
huguenot
ancestor
nice
place
to
be
wearing
it
then
at
a
football
game
exclaimed
judy
indignantly
and
then
forcing
other
people
to
take
charge
of
it
for
you
redress
indeed
do
you
want
molly
to
pay
you
for
your
ring
i
tell
you
miss
blount
that
a
person
who
really
had
huguenot
ancestors
would
never
have
suggested
such
a
thing
it
would
have
been
huguenot
etiquette
and
judy
flung
herself
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
steps
before
the
astonished
judith
had
time
to
realize
that
she
had
been
insulted
by
an
upstart
of
a
freshman
it
looked
very
much
for
a
day
or
two
as
if
molly
were
going
to
have
a
congestion
in
one
lung
for
several
days
she
was
a
very
sick
girl
she
had
a
strange
delirium
that
she
was
looking
for
something
while
she
was
walking
on
stilts
many
times
she
asked
the
nurse
if
sapphires
were
as
valuable
as
emeralds
and
once
she
demanded
to
know
if
an
emerald
as
large
as
her
little
finger
nail
was
worth
much
money
say
two
acres
of
good
orchard
land
but
the
lung
was
not
congested
as
mclean
had
at
first
thought
in
a
day
or
two
the
fever
subsided
and
by
thursday
she
was
able
to
sit
up
in
bed
propped
by
many
pillows
and
see
judy
and
nance
her
room
was
a
bower
of
flowers
they
had
even
come
from
exmoor
lawrence
upton
having
sent
her
a
box
of
lovely
pink
roses
mclean
had
brought
her
a
bunch
of
red
berries
from
the
woods
and
one
day
two
cards
were
brought
up
one
of
which
looked
familiar
miss
grace
green
and
edwin
green
inquiring
as
to
the
improvement
in
miss
molly
brown
condition
were
pleased
to
hear
that
she
was
better
and
now
nance
and
judy
sat
on
either
side
the
young
invalid
each
trying
to
assume
a
cheerful
expression
and
each
feeling
that
whatever
disagreeable
things
had
happened
and
several
had
happened
they
must
be
hidden
from
molly
at
all
costs
judith
blount
had
scattered
reports
around
college
of
an
extremely
hateful
character
which
molly
friends
had
done
their
best
to
suppress
the
ring
had
never
been
found
although
everything
had
been
done
that
could
be
thought
of
in
the
way
of
advertising
and
searching
moreover
miss
steel
had
asked
twice
of
molly
condition
in
a
very
meaning
tone
of
voice
and
had
wished
to
know
exactly
when
the
nurse
thought
molly
would
be
able
to
see
visitors
these
things
the
girls
knew
and
since
molly
was
still
weak
and
very
hoarse
her
friends
were
careful
to
keep
off
dangerous
subjects
strange
to
say
molly
had
never
mentioned
the
ring
to
any
one
since
she
had
been
in
the
hospital
everybody
has
been
so
beautifully
kind
she
was
saying
and
really
i
think
the
rest
is
going
to
do
me
so
much
good
that
when
i
get
well
i
be
better
than
i
was
before
i
got
sick
she
added
laughing
we
missed
you
terribly
said
nance
dolefully
queen
just
a
dead
old
hole
without
you
molly
dear
went
on
judy
affectionately
molly
smiled
lovingly
at
her
two
friends
you
are
the
dearest
she
began
taking
a
hand
of
each
when
the
nurse
entered
miss
stewart
would
like
to
see
you
miss
brown
oh
yes
cried
molly
do
ask
her
to
come
up
nance
and
judy
did
not
linger
after
mary
stewart
arrival
her
face
also
wore
a
serious
look
and
she
took
molly
hand
and
gazed
down
into
her
face
almost
with
a
compassionate
expression
how
are
you
molly
dear
oh
i
much
better
replied
molly
cheerfully
i
shall
be
up
by
the
doctor
says
and
i
expect
to
go
back
to
queen
sunday
mary
sat
down
and
drew
her
chair
up
close
to
the
little
white
bed
it
almost
providential
my
being
in
the
hospital
like
this
went
on
molly
it
rested
me
so
you
see
i
was
terribly
worried
about
something
when
i
came
here
and
you
are
worried
any
longer
no
i
conquered
it
i
know
it
got
to
be
faced
but
i
believe
there
will
be
a
way
out
of
it
and
i
not
frightened
any
more
i
have
always
had
a
kind
of
blind
faith
like
that
when
things
look
very
black
you
are
talking
of
the
emerald
ring
are
you
molly
yes
mary
i
know
it
has
been
found
of
course
i
can
tell
that
by
the
girls
faces
and
i
know
that
judith
blount
is
well
she
is
your
friend
mary
oh
no
not
now
put
in
mary
we
had
a
er
difference
of
opinion
that
has
well
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
broken
up
our
friendship
i
always
admired
her
without
ever
really
liking
her
molly
looked
at
mary
and
a
very
tender
expression
came
into
her
heavenly
blue
eyes
was
the
difference
about
me
she
asked
presently
mary
hesitated
yes
molly
since
you
force
me
to
tell
you
it
was
she
has
been
saying
some
horrid
things
of
course
i
knew
she
would
i
was
prepared
for
that
and
i
could
tell
molly
paused
no
no
i
must
she
exclaimed
hastily
what
could
you
tell
molly
do
ask
me
i
would
never
speak
to
myself
again
if
i
did
tell
she
has
been
saying
that
i
never
lost
the
ring
that
i
was
poor
and
needed
the
money
and
things
like
that
tell
me
honestly
is
that
the
truth
mary
nodded
her
head
and
frowned
there
was
a
silence
and
presently
mary
strong
brown
fingers
closed
over
molly
slender
ones
molly
she
began
in
a
tone
of
voice
i
almost
glad
that
this
subject
has
come
up
because
i
came
here
really
to
she
broke
off
it
very
hard
she
began
again
i
hardly
know
how
to
put
it
you
knew
molly
dear
that
i
was
rich
did
you
why
yes
i
guessed
you
must
be
although
you
have
been
careful
not
to
mention
it
yourself
you
the
most
finest
girl
i
ever
knew
mary
she
added
impetuously
mary
laughed
that
nice
of
you
to
say
such
things
dear
because
i
have
but
one
ancestor
on
my
paternal
side
and
that
father
but
he
generations
in
himself
he
so
splendid
but
to
go
on
molly
dear
i
am
rich
not
ordinarily
rich
but
enormously
vastly
rich
it
absurd
really
because
we
never
spend
it
and
we
do
care
a
rap
about
saving
it
but
whatever
father
touches
just
turns
to
gold
i
wish
he
touch
something
for
me
laughed
molly
wistfully
now
listen
to
me
dear
and
do
interrupt
father
adores
me
to
that
extent
that
i
could
spend
any
amount
of
money
and
he
would
just
smile
and
say
ahead
little
mary
go
as
far
as
you
like
but
you
see
i
only
want
a
few
very
nice
things
consequently
i
ca
be
extravagant
to
save
my
life
molly
laughed
aloud
at
this
na√Øve
confession
the
point
i
coming
to
is
this
molly
judith
blount
is
being
exceedingly
horrid
over
that
ring
i
believe
myself
it
will
be
found
eventually
but
until
it
is
found
i
want
you
now
do
interrupt
me
and
do
carry
on
please
i
want
you
to
ask
her
the
value
of
her
old
ring
and
give
her
the
money
for
it
if
she
chooses
to
be
she
must
be
treated
with
methods
but
dearest
mary
i
ca
began
molly
yes
you
can
i
have
known
you
but
a
few
months
molly
but
learned
to
love
you
in
that
time
and
when
i
really
care
for
any
one
which
is
seldom
she
becomes
a
sister
to
me
you
are
my
little
sister
and
shall
always
be
i
shall
never
change
and
between
sisters
there
must
be
no
foolish
pride
now
molly
i
want
to
settle
this
thing
with
judith
blount
once
and
for
all
through
you
of
course
she
is
not
to
know
i
had
anything
to
do
with
it
you
must
tell
her
that
you
have
raised
the
money
and
would
like
to
pay
her
the
full
value
of
the
ring
when
the
ring
is
found
she
can
give
you
back
the
money
that
will
stop
her
wicked
wagging
tongue
at
least
molly
tried
hard
not
to
cry
but
the
tears
welled
up
in
her
eyes
and
trickled
down
her
cheeks
she
took
mary
hand
and
kissed
it
i
wish
i
could
kiss
you
dearest
mary
she
sobbed
but
you
see
got
such
a
bad
cold
how
could
she
thank
mary
for
her
generous
offer
or
explain
that
her
family
would
never
allow
her
to
accept
the
money
even
if
she
felt
she
could
herself
you
are
the
finest
noblest
most
generous
girl
she
went
on
brokenly
no
i
not
said
mary
it
easy
to
do
things
for
people
we
love
and
easier
still
when
we
have
the
money
to
do
it
with
if
i
had
been
so
fond
of
you
molly
and
had
been
obliged
to
deny
myself
besides
that
would
have
been
generosity
this
is
only
a
pleasure
a
sort
of
because
i
adopted
you
you
see
as
my
little
sister
molly
lay
quietly
for
a
while
with
her
cheek
pressed
against
hand
are
you
thinking
it
over
asked
mary
at
last
patting
her
cheek
i
thinking
how
happy
i
am
answered
molly
as
soon
as
you
are
well
then
went
on
mary
rising
to
go
you
must
have
an
interview
with
judith
and
settle
the
whole
thing
molly
smiled
up
at
her
friend
and
squeezed
her
hand
there
are
times
when
two
friends
need
not
speak
to
express
what
they
think
even
if
i
never
win
the
three
golden
apples
she
reflected
after
mary
had
gone
i
have
won
three
friends
that
are
as
true
as
gold
chapter
xx
miss
steel
with
the
wonderful
powers
of
recuperation
which
natures
like
have
on
sunday
morning
she
was
up
and
dressed
almost
dancing
about
her
room
in
the
infirmary
long
before
it
was
time
for
mclean
to
call
and
grant
her
permission
to
leave
it
was
good
to
be
up
and
well
again
it
was
good
to
be
at
college
for
she
had
been
homesick
for
wellington
since
she
had
been
shut
up
in
the
hospital
and
better
still
it
was
good
to
have
friends
such
friends
as
she
had
as
for
the
emerald
ring
a
shadow
darkened
her
face
the
thought
of
the
emerald
ring
would
push
its
way
into
her
mind
i
believe
it
will
come
out
all
right
she
said
to
herself
i
believe
it
i
believe
it
i
could
help
losing
it
and
if
it
is
found
i
ca
help
that
either
i
just
wo
be
miserable
that
all
i
feel
too
happy
and
too
well
are
you
at
home
to
visitors
this
morning
miss
brown
asked
a
sharp
unmusical
voice
at
the
door
oh
yes
do
come
in
answered
molly
rising
to
meet
miss
steel
who
had
walked
up
the
uncarpeted
steps
and
along
the
echoing
corridor
without
making
a
sound
as
usual
molly
manners
were
unfailingly
cordial
to
visitors
and
when
she
shook
hands
with
miss
steel
and
insisted
on
making
her
take
the
armchair
that
person
visibly
softened
a
little
and
faintly
smiled
molly
wondered
why
the
sanitary
inspector
had
called
on
her
but
she
appreciated
attentions
from
anybody
and
was
as
grateful
for
being
popular
as
if
it
were
something
entirely
new
and
strange
to
her
she
showed
miss
steel
her
flowers
and
pinned
a
lovely
pink
rose
on
the
inspector
cloth
coat
she
made
light
of
her
illness
and
rejoiced
that
she
was
returning
in
a
few
hours
to
dear
old
queen
she
was
in
fact
so
wonderfully
sweet
and
charming
that
sunday
morning
that
it
must
have
been
very
difficult
even
for
the
stony
inspector
to
touch
on
the
real
business
of
her
visit
at
last
however
miss
steel
buckled
on
her
armor
of
decision
averted
her
eyes
for
a
moment
from
molly
glowing
face
and
plunged
in
i
do
suppose
miss
brown
you
suspected
my
title
of
inspector
here
was
merely
a
nominal
one
and
that
i
had
another
motive
in
being
at
wellington
college
molly
hardly
liked
to
tell
her
that
they
had
long
considered
her
a
spy
and
detested
her
for
that
reason
she
said
nothing
therefore
and
sat
in
her
favorite
position
when
listening
intently
with
her
hands
clasping
one
knee
and
her
shoulders
drooping
a
very
wrong
position
indeed
considering
that
it
would
eventually
make
her
and
hollow
chested
but
molly
was
never
more
graceful
or
comfortable
than
when
she
adopted
this
unhealthful
attitude
i
am
an
inspector
went
on
the
other
but
i
am
an
inspector
of
police
that
is
a
detective
doubtless
you
have
heard
of
certain
mysterious
things
that
have
happened
at
wellington
this
autumn
the
attempt
to
burn
the
gymnasium
which
we
now
believe
was
only
a
practical
joke
to
frighten
the
sophomore
class
the
cutting
of
the
electric
wires
one
night
and
there
are
a
few
other
things
you
have
not
heard
for
instance
miss
walker
has
received
lately
several
anonymous
letters
two
of
them
about
you
molly
started
about
me
she
exclaimed
yes
said
miss
steel
watching
her
closely
but
they
were
not
disagreeable
letters
strange
to
say
since
anonymous
letters
usually
are
they
expressed
the
most
ardent
admiration
for
you
they
mentioned
that
you
had
enemies
who
were
trying
to
ruin
your
reputation
how
absurd
exclaimed
molly
indignantly
she
detested
anything
deceitful
and
underhand
with
all
her
soul
when
did
these
letters
come
just
since
you
have
been
at
the
infirmary
they
must
be
about
the
emerald
ring
broke
in
molly
exactly
answered
the
inspector
you
have
lost
a
valuable
emerald
ring
belonging
to
another
girl
who
is
making
it
disagreeable
for
you
but
i
did
want
to
take
care
of
her
ring
protested
molly
she
insisted
on
it
it
was
too
big
for
my
finger
and
when
i
fainted
it
must
have
slipped
off
i
done
everything
i
could
to
find
it
but
she
need
worry
she
be
paid
for
it
if
two
acres
of
good
apple
orchard
that
were
to
have
paid
my
college
expenses
have
to
go
nonsense
child
exclaimed
miss
steel
suddenly
melting
into
a
human
being
i
going
to
find
that
ring
for
you
if
it
takes
the
rest
of
this
winter
molly
seized
her
hand
joyfully
by
one
of
those
swift
flashes
of
insight
which
come
to
us
when
we
least
expect
them
it
was
revealed
to
molly
that
she
had
made
a
friend
of
the
inspector
i
have
been
here
almost
a
month
continued
miss
steel
giving
the
girl
hand
a
little
vicelike
squeeze
which
was
her
way
of
expressing
cordiality
and
i
have
found
out
a
great
many
things
a
girls
college
is
a
strange
place
there
is
a
good
deal
of
and
petty
jealousy
among
a
certain
class
of
girls
and
yet
i
have
reason
to
know
that
the
code
of
honor
here
is
exceedingly
high
and
i
find
myself
growing
more
and
more
interested
in
the
girls
and
their
lives
nowhere
but
in
college
could
such
devoted
friendships
be
formed
they
are
elevating
and
fine
especially
for
selfish
girls
who
learn
how
to
be
unselfish
by
example
the
girls
develop
each
other
your
society
for
instance
has
had
a
remarkably
refining
and
shall
i
say
quieting
effect
on
miss
andrews
molly
started
she
was
amazed
at
the
inspector
insight
into
the
college
life
which
brings
me
to
the
point
i
have
been
aiming
to
reach
since
i
have
been
here
i
have
taken
pains
to
learn
the
history
of
miss
andrews
as
well
as
to
study
her
character
she
is
a
strange
girl
doubtless
you
know
the
incident
of
last
year
molly
shook
her
head
to
begin
at
the
beginning
miss
andrews
parents
were
rather
strange
people
her
father
is
a
city
politician
who
never
made
any
secret
of
his
grafting
methods
her
mother
was
an
actress
and
is
dead
frances
been
brought
up
to
any
code
of
honor
she
had
been
allowed
to
do
as
she
chose
and
had
all
the
money
she
wanted
to
spend
if
she
is
vulgar
and
pretentious
it
is
really
her
fault
last
year
she
offended
her
class
by
telling
a
falsehood
she
was
under
honor
according
to
the
custom
here
when
a
student
leaves
the
premises
to
be
back
from
some
visit
by
ten
sunday
night
she
missed
the
ten
train
and
took
the
train
which
arrived
at
midnight
however
as
luck
would
have
it
the
ten
train
was
delayed
by
a
washout
and
drew
into
wellington
station
just
in
front
of
the
train
frances
was
on
she
of
course
found
this
out
immediately
and
taking
advantage
of
it
she
gave
out
that
she
had
been
on
the
earlier
train
which
saved
all
unnecessary
explanations
it
must
have
been
a
great
temptation
for
a
girl
brought
up
as
she
had
been
but
truth
always
comes
to
the
top
sooner
or
later
and
as
the
president
of
her
own
class
happened
to
have
been
on
the
earlier
train
she
was
found
out
she
was
summoned
by
the
student
council
tried
and
found
guilty
then
she
was
treated
i
imagine
something
in
the
same
way
that
a
french
soldier
is
expelled
from
the
army
figuratively
speaking
her
sword
was
broken
and
her
epaulettes
torn
from
her
uniform
how
terrible
exclaimed
molly
yes
it
was
pretty
severe
but
she
was
very
defiant
and
said
dreadful
things
denounced
her
class
and
college
few
girls
would
have
had
the
courage
to
return
to
college
next
year
but
she
came
back
hoping
to
live
her
dishonor
down
and
when
she
found
her
class
to
a
member
ignored
her
very
existence
she
became
almost
insane
with
bitterness
and
rage
and
having
studied
her
character
closely
i
judge
that
for
a
while
until
your
secret
society
took
her
in
hand
she
was
hardly
responsible
for
her
actions
now
miss
walker
is
very
sorry
for
frances
andrews
but
she
considers
her
a
dangerous
element
in
college
and
at
she
would
like
some
definite
reason
for
asking
her
not
to
come
back
i
am
speaking
plainly
because
miss
walker
is
convinced
that
you
know
a
definite
reason
and
through
some
mistaken
idea
of
kindness
you
keep
it
to
yourself
in
fact
miss
brown
miss
walker
is
convinced
that
you
and
you
alone
saw
frances
andrews
cut
the
wires
in
the
gymnasium
that
night
but
i
did
cried
molly
much
excited
or
rather
it
was
miss
andrews
miss
steel
looked
at
her
in
surprise
so
sure
was
she
that
molly
would
confirm
her
suspicions
molly
sat
down
again
and
clasped
her
knees
with
her
long
arms
her
cheeks
were
crimson
and
her
eyes
blazing
who
was
it
then
asked
the
inspector
i
ca
tell
you
that
miss
steel
if
i
should
give
you
the
girl
name
i
should
be
dishonored
all
my
life
i
have
been
brought
up
to
believe
that
the
one
who
tells
is
as
low
as
the
one
who
did
the
deed
when
we
were
children
my
mother
would
never
listen
to
a
telltale
i
do
think
it
was
a
wicked
mischievous
thing
to
have
done
a
contemptible
thing
but
i
rather
you
found
out
the
name
of
the
girl
in
some
other
way
than
through
me
especially
right
now
why
right
now
but
molly
would
not
reply
miss
steel
could
see
nothing
but
truth
in
the
depths
of
molly
troubled
blue
eyes
she
took
the
girl
hand
in
her
and
looked
at
her
gravely
you
are
a
fine
girl
miss
brown
she
said
and
if
you
tell
me
that
the
girl
who
cut
the
wires
was
not
miss
andrews
i
believe
you
implicitly
of
course
miss
walker
would
never
tell
miss
andrews
not
to
return
to
wellington
without
something
very
definite
and
tangible
on
which
to
base
her
dismissal
luke
andrews
the
girl
father
is
as
and
high
tempered
as
his
daughter
and
he
would
probably
make
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
cause
a
great
deal
of
publicity
if
frances
were
asked
to
leave
college
quietly
i
sorry
for
her
said
molly
i
think
she
might
have
been
helped
if
she
had
had
just
a
little
more
time
after
all
the
worse
thing
about
her
is
her
bringing
up
and
this
other
girl
whom
you
are
shielding
miss
brown
does
she
deserve
so
much
generosity
from
you
molly
closed
her
lips
firmly
that
is
the
question
with
me
miss
steel
she
said
at
last
the
question
is
could
i
ever
show
my
face
again
if
i
told
but
no
one
need
ever
know
that
is
no
one
but
the
president
and
me
you
do
understand
said
molly
wearily
it
with
me
you
see
i
could
never
be
on
comfortable
terms
with
myself
again
i
should
always
be
thinking
that
i
had
behaved
well
like
a
gentleman
then
the
inspector
did
a
most
surprising
thing
she
went
over
and
kissed
molly
i
would
for
worlds
keep
you
from
being
true
to
yourself
my
child
she
exclaimed
it
a
rare
quality
and
one
which
will
make
you
devoted
friends
all
your
life
because
people
will
always
know
they
can
trust
you
molly
looked
at
the
inspector
and
lo
and
behold
a
strange
transformation
had
taken
place
in
that
inscrutable
expressionless
face
the
cold
gray
eyes
were
softened
by
a
mist
of
tears
and
the
thin
lips
were
actually
quivering
she
looked
almost
beautiful
at
that
moment
and
molly
suddenly
put
her
arms
around
her
neck
and
laid
her
head
on
the
flat
hard
chest
you
forgive
me
wo
you
miss
steel
i
will
indeed
dear
answered
the
other
patting
molly
cheek
and
now
do
bother
about
all
this
business
get
well
and
strong
overwork
and
i
promise
to
find
that
ring
for
you
if
i
have
to
turn
the
college
upside
down
to
do
it
then
she
gave
molly
a
warm
motherly
squeeze
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
took
her
departure
as
quietly
as
she
had
come
chapter
xxi
a
bachelor
pocket
miss
steel
was
a
very
busy
woman
that
afternoon
she
was
shut
up
with
judy
kean
for
half
an
hour
she
visited
the
livery
stable
in
the
village
she
paid
a
call
on
mclean
and
finally
she
went
to
see
professor
green
it
is
in
professor
green
study
on
the
cloisters
that
we
now
find
her
sitting
bolt
upright
in
her
chair
alert
and
at
such
times
as
this
miss
steel
is
not
unlike
a
hunting
dog
on
the
scent
of
his
quarry
professor
green
sits
at
his
desk
he
looks
tired
and
his
heavy
reddish
eyebrows
are
drawn
together
in
a
frown
when
the
inspector
came
into
the
room
he
had
pushed
a
pile
of
manuscript
under
some
loose
papers
but
a
sheet
had
slipped
off
and
now
lay
in
plain
view
across
it
was
written
in
a
bold
hand
exeunt
fairies
in
disorder
leaving
wood
sprite
at
left
centre
the
song
of
the
wood
sprite
i
hope
you
will
pardon
this
intrusion
professor
i
see
you
are
very
busy
the
inspector
began
glancing
at
the
manuscript
with
a
look
of
some
slight
amusement
the
professor
hastily
covered
up
the
sheet
not
at
all
he
said
politely
i
just
idling
away
a
little
time
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
had
seen
miss
steel
about
the
building
and
most
of
the
faculty
knew
her
by
this
time
as
inspector
of
dormitories
do
you
remember
helping
a
young
lady
who
fainted
on
the
day
of
the
football
game
oh
yes
certainly
replied
the
professor
fingering
a
paper
cutter
you
lent
her
your
overcoat
that
afternoon
did
you
why
yes
i
believe
i
did
have
you
worn
the
coat
since
certainly
he
answered
laughing
every
day
and
several
times
a
day
it
the
only
one
i
have
are
you
a
detective
yes
do
you
ever
put
things
in
the
pockets
of
your
coat
the
professor
smiled
shamefacedly
like
a
schoolboy
culprit
in
one
of
them
there
been
a
hole
in
the
other
one
for
a
long
time
two
years
at
least
would
you
mind
letting
me
see
that
coat
he
lifted
the
blue
overcoat
from
a
hook
on
the
door
and
placed
it
on
a
chair
beside
miss
steel
am
i
a
suspect
he
asked
politely
has
anything
been
lost
the
detective
seized
the
overcoat
and
began
rummaging
through
the
pockets
with
a
practised
hand
yes
she
answered
something
has
been
lost
and
extremely
disagreeable
things
have
been
said
by
the
owner
about
it
about
me
asked
the
professor
still
groping
in
the
dark
no
no
about
the
girl
who
lost
it
miss
brown
the
detective
did
not
reply
she
had
run
her
hand
through
the
hole
in
the
pocket
and
was
now
searching
the
corners
between
the
lining
and
the
cloth
ha
she
cried
at
last
exactly
like
the
detective
in
a
play
here
it
is
with
a
swift
movement
she
extricated
her
hand
from
the
bottomless
pocket
and
displayed
between
her
thumb
and
forefinger
a
large
emerald
ring
why
that
the
ring
of
my
cousin
judith
blount
exclaimed
the
professor
in
amazement
and
i
have
had
it
in
my
pocket
all
this
time
great
heavens
what
an
extraordinary
thing
and
how
did
it
get
there
miss
blount
forced
miss
brown
to
take
charge
of
it
while
she
was
playing
football
after
miss
brown
came
to
from
her
faint
she
must
have
been
very
cold
and
slipped
her
hands
in
the
pockets
of
this
coat
for
warmth
she
did
confirmed
the
professor
and
the
ring
slipped
off
when
she
found
it
was
lost
she
got
up
at
dawn
next
day
and
went
out
in
her
slippers
in
the
snow
to
find
it
and
nearly
caught
her
death
but
she
had
no
thanks
for
her
trouble
from
your
relation
i
can
assure
you
nothing
but
abuse
what
shouted
the
professor
you
mean
to
say
that
judith
has
dared
to
insinuate
she
has
said
miss
steel
and
she
whom
miss
brown
has
shielded
great
heavens
this
is
too
much
he
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
in
a
rage
shielded
from
what
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
tell
you
he
replied
the
girl
repented
of
what
she
did
i
know
that
but
she
an
ungrateful
little
wretch
a
scholarly
professor
of
english
literature
however
is
no
match
for
a
detective
and
with
a
knowing
smile
on
her
lips
the
inspector
rose
to
leave
you
may
return
the
ring
she
said
it
will
be
a
great
relief
to
miss
molly
brown
of
kentucky
to
know
it
has
been
found
she
was
about
to
give
up
two
acres
of
good
apple
orchard
to
pay
for
it
the
land
in
fact
which
was
to
provide
the
money
for
her
college
expenses
and
with
that
she
sailed
out
of
the
room
and
went
straight
to
the
home
of
president
walker
with
whom
she
spent
the
better
part
of
an
hour
professor
green
followed
close
on
her
heels
he
did
not
pause
at
miss
walker
pretty
stucco
residence
however
but
hastened
down
the
campus
and
rang
the
bell
at
queen
cottage
miss
brown
was
in
he
learned
from
the
maid
she
had
only
arrived
from
the
infirmary
that
afternoon
the
professor
waited
in
the
sitting
room
deserted
by
the
students
at
that
hour
those
who
were
not
studying
in
their
rooms
being
at
vespers
presently
molly
appeared
looking
very
slender
and
tall
like
a
pale
flower
swaying
on
its
stalk
the
professor
rushed
up
and
seized
her
hand
unceremoniously
my
dear
child
he
cried
how
am
i
ever
going
to
make
my
apologies
to
you
for
all
this
trouble
of
which
i
have
been
the
unconscious
cause
for
what
began
molly
too
much
astonished
to
finish
her
question
the
ring
the
ring
it
been
concealed
in
the
ragged
lining
of
my
shabby
old
overcoat
all
this
time
and
that
clever
detective
of
dormitories
or
whatever
she
is
ferreted
it
out
just
now
perhaps
i
should
have
thought
of
it
myself
but
you
see
i
had
even
heard
the
ring
had
been
lost
i
am
afraid
you
suffered
a
great
deal
i
did
at
first
but
after
i
grew
better
i
never
let
myself
slip
back
into
that
state
again
i
kept
believing
it
would
be
found
i
was
so
sure
of
it
that
i
have
really
been
unhappy
at
all
you
see
everybody
is
so
beautifully
kind
and
no
one
believed
great
heavens
interrupted
the
professor
storming
excitedly
around
the
room
that
ungrateful
wicked
girl
to
have
made
such
an
accusation
she
shall
hear
from
me
what
she
owes
to
you
i
take
the
ring
to
her
myself
later
she
is
my
cousin
and
her
brother
is
as
near
to
me
as
my
own
brother
but
you
are
going
to
tell
prexy
cried
molly
i
must
besides
i
nearly
gave
it
away
to
miss
steel
oh
well
if
that
the
case
she
knows
already
she
a
detective
and
if
you
let
two
words
slip
she
can
easily
guess
the
rest
there
no
keeping
anything
from
her
you
may
be
sure
prexy
knows
it
by
this
time
i
rather
relieved
said
the
professor
judith
will
probably
be
well
punished
but
she
should
be
i
always
wondered
said
molly
after
a
short
pause
why
judith
did
it
the
professor
looked
at
her
closely
with
his
humorous
brown
eyes
have
you
no
idea
why
he
asked
except
for
mischief
and
to
annoy
the
seniors
she
answered
possibly
he
said
a
girl
who
has
been
spoiled
and
petted
as
she
has
will
give
in
to
almost
any
whim
that
seizes
her
however
such
actions
are
not
tolerated
at
wellington
and
she
will
have
to
learn
a
few
pretty
stiff
lessons
if
she
expects
to
remain
here
then
professor
green
shook
hands
with
molly
gave
her
a
little
paternal
advice
about
taking
care
of
her
health
and
took
his
departure
his
next
destination
was
the
president
house
where
he
waited
in
the
until
miss
steel
had
terminated
her
interview
he
was
prepared
for
a
round
scolding
from
his
old
friend
who
had
known
him
since
his
early
youth
but
the
president
was
inclined
to
be
lenient
with
the
young
man
it
all
goes
to
show
she
said
at
the
end
of
the
interview
that
murder
will
out
but
why
did
the
foolish
girl
do
that
mischievous
thing
what
did
she
have
to
gain
by
it
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
jealous
of
some
one
prettier
and
more
popular
than
herself
probably
he
answered
the
president
sighed
who
can
understand
the
intricacies
of
a
young
girl
heart
she
said
i
have
been
studying
them
for
twenty
years
and
they
are
still
a
closed
book
to
me
when
professor
green
a
little
later
returned
the
emerald
ring
to
his
cousin
he
cut
the
visit
as
short
as
possible
he
told
her
that
she
had
deliberately
and
wrongfully
accused
one
who
had
shielded
her
even
at
the
risk
of
offending
the
president
of
wellington
college
and
that
it
was
he
who
had
given
the
detective
already
suspicious
the
clue
she
wanted
judith
wept
bitterly
but
her
cousin
showed
no
signs
of
relenting
if
you
want
to
be
loved
he
said
learn
unselfishness
and
gentleness
and
truthfulness
these
are
the
qualities
that
make
men
and
women
beloved
you
will
never
gain
anything
by
cheating
and
lying
the
end
of
the
episode
was
a
pretty
severe
punishment
for
judith
blount
she
was
suspended
from
college
for
three
weeks
and
was
compelled
to
resign
from
all
societies
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
she
left
college
next
morning
early
and
no
one
saw
her
again
until
after
christmas
when
she
returned
a
much
chastened
and
quieted
young
woman
a
few
days
after
she
had
gone
molly
received
a
note
from
her
from
new
york
it
read
dear
miss
brown
will
you
forgive
me
i
am
very
unhappy
judith
blount
you
may
be
sure
that
molly
reply
was
prompt
and
forgiving
chapter
xxii
christmas
and
the
wanderthirst
there
are
few
lonelier
and
more
dismal
experiences
in
life
than
christmas
away
from
home
for
the
first
time
molly
felt
her
heart
sink
as
the
great
day
approached
one
morning
a
trainload
of
chattering
laughing
girls
pulled
out
of
the
wellington
station
judy
hanging
recklessly
to
the
last
step
waved
her
handkerchief
until
molly
figure
grew
indistinct
in
the
distance
and
nance
on
the
crowded
platform
called
out
again
and
again
molly
dear
molly
almost
regretted
that
she
had
ever
left
kentucky
as
the
christmas
train
became
a
point
of
black
on
the
horizon
i
might
have
ended
my
days
as
a
teacher
in
a
country
and
been
happier
than
this
she
thought
desperately
starting
back
to
college
some
one
came
running
up
behind
her
it
was
mary
stewart
who
had
been
down
to
see
some
classmates
off
she
was
to
take
the
night
train
to
new
york
when
do
you
get
off
she
asked
slipping
her
arm
through
molly
like
the
good
comrade
she
was
i
surprised
you
did
leave
yesterday
with
such
a
long
journey
before
you
i
not
going
home
this
christmas
replied
molly
not
going
began
mary
you
to
be
left
at
queen
by
yourself
molly
nodded
vainly
endeavoring
to
smile
cheerfully
then
you
to
go
with
me
i
come
right
along
now
and
help
you
pack
announced
mary
decisively
but
mary
i
ca
i
have
anything
money
or
clothes
do
say
to
me
i
got
everything
i
even
got
the
to
myself
on
the
night
train
to
new
york
you
shall
go
with
me
i
do
know
why
i
never
thought
of
it
before
we
have
a
beautiful
christmas
together
since
mother
death
five
years
ago
christmas
has
been
a
dismal
time
at
our
house
you
be
just
the
person
to
cheer
us
up
it
will
be
like
having
a
child
in
the
house
you
shall
have
a
christmas
tree
and
hang
up
your
stocking
father
will
be
delighted
and
so
will
brother
willie
thus
overruled
molly
was
borne
triumphantly
to
new
york
that
same
evening
and
spent
one
of
the
most
wonderful
christmases
of
her
life
in
mary
beautiful
home
on
riverside
drive
as
her
mother
and
godmother
both
wisely
sent
her
checks
for
christmas
gifts
she
was
not
embarrassed
by
any
lack
of
ready
money
she
was
even
rich
enough
to
purchase
a
new
evening
dress
and
a
pretty
blouse
which
mary
had
ordered
to
be
sent
up
on
approval
and
not
for
many
a
year
afterward
did
she
guess
why
those
charming
things
happened
to
be
such
bargains
but
molly
was
a
very
inexperienced
young
person
and
knew
little
concerning
prices
at
that
time
mary
father
was
a
fine
man
quiet
and
with
a
splendid
rugged
face
he
treated
his
only
daughter
with
indescribable
tenderness
and
called
her
little
mary
they
did
not
see
much
of
brother
willie
a
sophomore
at
yale
and
very
busy
enjoying
his
holiday
he
regarded
molly
as
a
child
and
his
sister
as
an
old
maid
but
condescended
to
take
them
to
the
theatre
twice
but
all
good
things
must
come
to
an
end
and
it
seemed
just
a
little
while
before
molly
found
herself
back
at
her
old
desk
in
her
room
at
queen
writing
a
letter
to
stewart
which
pleased
him
mightily
since
mary
guests
had
never
before
taken
that
trouble
judy
came
back
radiantly
happy
she
had
had
a
glorious
time
in
washington
with
her
vagabond
parents
as
she
called
them
nance
too
had
enjoyed
her
christmas
with
her
father
and
busy
mother
who
had
come
home
to
rest
during
the
holidays
only
one
of
queen
girls
did
not
join
the
jolly
circle
that
now
congregated
in
the
most
hospitable
room
in
the
house
to
swap
holiday
experiences
but
a
letter
had
arrived
from
the
missing
member
addressed
to
miss
brown
and
beginning
my
dear
molly
brown
the
letter
ran
i
off
for
europe
and
grandmamma
by
the
sailing
the
eighteenth
i
am
afraid
i
was
too
much
like
a
bull
in
a
china
shop
at
college
i
was
always
breaking
something
mostly
rules
i
done
lots
of
foolish
things
and
i
am
sorry
they
were
jokes
of
course
most
of
them
and
intended
to
frighten
silly
people
i
learned
a
great
deal
from
you
and
your
friends
but
i
rather
practice
my
new
wisdom
on
other
people
if
you
ever
see
me
again
you
find
me
changed
i
may
enter
a
convent
for
a
few
years
in
france
and
learn
to
keep
quiet
you
did
what
you
could
for
me
and
so
did
the
others
you
are
a
first
rate
lot
and
you
make
a
jolly
good
freshman
class
i
shall
miss
you
and
i
shall
miss
old
wellington
i
would
have
come
back
this
year
if
i
had
felt
the
call
of
its
two
gray
towers
somehow
it
been
more
of
a
home
to
me
than
most
places
and
when
i
quite
old
and
forgotten
i
shall
go
back
and
see
it
again
some
day
again
and
good
luck
i
told
murphy
to
give
you
my
persian
prayer
rug
it
just
your
color
of
blue
f
andrews
molly
read
the
letter
aloud
and
the
girls
were
half
sorry
and
half
relieved
over
its
contents
after
all
frances
was
a
very
disturbing
element
but
as
margaret
wakefield
announced
later
at
a
meeting
of
the
society
she
had
responded
to
kind
treatment
and
she
margaret
moved
that
they
send
her
a
combination
steamer
letter
of
farewell
and
a
bunch
of
violets
to
cheer
her
on
her
lonely
voyage
the
movement
was
promptly
seconded
by
molly
carried
by
universal
acclaim
and
the
resolution
put
into
effect
immediately
after
christmas
comes
the
terror
of
every
freshman
heart
the
examinations
as
the
dreaded
week
approached
lights
burned
late
in
every
house
on
the
campus
and
nobody
offered
any
interference
behind
closed
doors
sat
scores
of
weary
maidens
with
pale
concentrated
faces
bent
over
judy
kean
made
a
record
at
queen
she
crammed
history
for
hours
at
a
stretch
only
stopping
for
food
occasionally
or
to
snatch
a
half
hour
nap
it
was
saturday
and
bitter
cold
examinations
were
to
begin
on
monday
and
there
yet
remained
two
more
blessed
days
of
respite
molly
in
a
long
gray
dressing
gown
with
a
towel
wrapped
around
her
head
had
been
cramming
mathematics
since
six
in
the
morning
and
now
at
eleven
she
lifted
her
eyes
from
the
hated
volume
and
looked
about
her
with
a
dazed
expression
as
if
she
had
suddenly
awakened
from
a
black
dream
nance
had
hurried
into
the
room
molly
for
heaven
sake
go
to
judy
i
think
she
losing
her
mind
she
has
overstudied
and
it
has
affected
her
brain
i
ca
do
anything
with
her
at
all
what
cried
molly
rushing
down
the
hall
her
long
gray
wrapper
trailing
after
her
in
voluminous
folds
she
opened
judy
door
unceremoniously
and
marched
in
the
room
looked
as
if
a
cyclone
had
struck
it
the
contents
of
the
bureau
drawers
were
dumped
onto
the
floor
the
closet
was
emptied
clothes
and
books
piled
about
on
the
bed
and
chairs
and
judy
two
trunks
filled
up
what
floor
space
remained
judy
herself
was
working
feverishly
she
had
packed
a
layer
of
books
in
one
of
the
trunks
and
was
now
folding
up
her
best
dresses
julia
kean
what
are
you
doing
cried
molly
in
a
stern
voice
judy
gave
her
a
constrained
nod
do
bother
me
now
there
a
dear
i
in
a
dreadful
hurry
molly
shook
her
violently
by
the
shoulder
she
had
a
feeling
that
judy
was
asleep
and
must
be
waked
up
get
up
from
there
this
minute
and
answer
my
question
she
commanded
what
was
your
question
asked
judy
with
an
embarrassed
little
laugh
oh
yes
you
asked
what
i
was
doing
i
should
think
you
could
see
i
was
gathering
cowslips
on
the
campus
are
you
running
away
judy
asked
molly
trying
another
tack
yes
my
mariucci
cried
judy
quoting
a
popular
song
gona
packa
my
trunk
and
taka
my
monk
and
sail
for
sunny
molly
refused
even
to
smile
at
this
witticism
i
know
what
you
doing
she
exclaimed
you
are
running
away
from
examinations
you
a
coward
you
are
no
better
than
a
deserter
from
the
army
in
time
of
war
it
bad
enough
in
time
of
peace
but
just
before
the
battle
i
so
ashamed
and
disappointed
in
you
that
i
can
hardly
understand
how
i
ever
could
have
loved
you
so
much
judy
went
on
stolidly
packing
rolling
her
clothes
into
little
bundles
and
stuffing
them
in
anywhere
she
could
find
a
place
between
her
numerous
books
have
you
lost
your
nerve
judy
dear
said
molly
after
a
minute
kneeling
down
beside
her
friend
and
seizing
her
hands
i
suppose
so
said
judy
extricating
her
hands
and
speaking
in
a
hard
strained
voice
in
an
effort
to
keep
from
breaking
down
rather
not
stay
here
and
be
disgraced
by
flunking
but
there
another
reason
beside
that
molly
i
know
i
look
like
a
deserter
and
deserve
to
be
shot
but
there
another
reason
she
wailed
there
another
good
reason
why
judy
dearest
what
can
it
be
asked
molly
gently
they
going
to
italy
she
burst
out
they
sailing
on
monday
i
got
the
letter
and
oh
i
ca
stand
it
i
ca
endure
it
they
be
in
sicily
in
a
few
weeks
and
without
me
mamma
hates
the
cold
so
do
i
numb
now
with
it
oh
molly
they
be
sailing
without
me
and
i
want
to
go
you
ca
understand
what
the
feeling
is
there
is
something
in
me
that
is
calling
all
the
time
and
i
help
hearing
it
and
answering
in
my
mind
i
can
live
through
every
bit
of
the
voyage
at
first
it
cold
bitter
cold
and
then
after
a
few
days
we
get
into
the
gulf
stream
and
gradually
it
grows
warmer
even
in
the
winter
time
the
air
is
soft
and
smells
of
the
south
at
last
the
azores
come
cunning
little
islands
snuggling
down
out
there
in
the
atlantic
and
finally
you
see
a
long
line
of
coast
it
africa
then
gibraltar
and
the
mediterranean
oh
molly
and
algiers
lovely
algiers
nestling
down
between
the
hills
and
looking
across
such
a
harbor
you
can
see
the
domes
of
the
mosques
as
you
sail
in
and
arab
boys
come
out
in
funny
little
boats
and
offer
to
row
you
to
shore
it
delightfully
warm
and
you
smell
flowers
everywhere
the
sky
is
a
deep
blue
it
like
june
and
then
after
algiers
comes
italy
judy
had
risen
to
her
feet
now
and
her
eyes
had
an
uncanny
expression
in
them
she
appeared
to
have
lost
sight
entirely
of
the
little
room
at
queen
and
through
the
chaos
of
books
and
clothing
she
was
seeing
a
vision
of
the
south
come
back
to
earth
judy
said
molly
gently
pulling
her
sleeve
would
your
mother
and
father
be
angry
with
you
for
giving
up
college
and
joining
them
uninvited
angry
cried
judy
of
course
not
even
if
i
just
caught
the
steamer
it
would
be
all
right
they
would
fix
it
up
somehow
and
they
would
be
glad
oh
so
glad
what
a
glorious
time
we
will
have
together
perhaps
we
shall
spend
a
few
weeks
in
capri
i
shall
try
and
make
them
stay
a
while
in
capri
such
a
view
there
is
at
capri
across
the
bay
papa
loves
naples
he
even
loves
its
dirtiness
and
calls
it
color
have
to
stay
there
a
week
to
satisfy
him
and
then
mamma
will
make
us
go
to
ravello
she
mad
about
it
and
then
i
have
my
choice
venice
of
course
but
we
wait
until
it
warmer
for
venice
april
is
perfect
there
and
then
rome
after
easter
oh
molly
molly
help
me
pack
i
off
i
off
is
it
glorious
italy
when
the
spring
begins
the
roses
and
the
violets
and
the
fresias
judy
began
running
about
the
room
snatching
her
things
from
the
bed
and
chairs
and
tossing
them
into
the
trunks
molly
watched
her
in
silence
for
a
while
she
must
collect
her
ideas
and
think
of
something
to
say
but
not
now
it
was
like
arguing
with
a
lunatic
to
say
anything
now
at
last
judy
feverish
energy
burned
itself
out
and
she
sat
down
on
the
bed
exhausted
so
you
going
to
give
up
four
splendid
years
at
college
and
all
the
friends
you
made
nance
and
me
and
margaret
and
jessie
and
nice
old
sallie
marks
and
mabel
all
the
fun
and
the
jolly
times
the
delightful
glorious
life
we
have
here
and
for
what
for
a
three
months
trip
you
have
taken
before
and
will
take
again
often
no
doubt
just
for
three
short
paltry
little
months
pleasure
you
going
to
give
up
things
that
will
be
precious
to
you
for
the
rest
of
your
life
it
not
only
the
book
learning
it
the
associations
and
the
friends
i
do
see
why
i
should
lose
my
friends
broke
in
judy
sullenly
they
never
be
the
same
again
they
could
after
such
a
disappointment
as
this
you
see
you
always
be
remembered
as
a
coward
who
turned
and
ran
when
examinations
came
you
lost
your
nerve
and
dropped
out
and
even
pretty
little
jessie
has
the
courage
to
face
it
oh
judy
but
i
disappointed
in
you
it
a
hard
blow
to
come
now
when
we
all
fighting
to
save
ourselves
and
pull
through
safely
and
you
one
of
the
cleverest
and
brightest
girls
in
the
class
do
tell
me
your
father
will
be
pleased
he
be
mortified
i
certain
of
it
he
much
too
fine
a
man
to
admire
a
cowardly
act
no
matter
whose
act
it
is
you
see
he
be
shocked
and
hurt
if
he
had
thought
it
was
right
for
you
to
give
up
college
on
the
eve
of
examinations
he
would
have
written
for
you
to
come
it
will
be
a
crushing
blow
to
him
judy
judy
lay
on
her
bed
her
hands
clasped
back
of
her
head
there
was
a
defiant
look
on
her
face
and
she
kicked
the
quilt
up
and
down
with
one
foot
like
an
impatient
horse
pawing
the
ground
then
suddenly
she
collapsed
like
a
pricked
balloon
burying
her
face
in
the
pillows
she
began
sobbing
bitterly
her
body
shaking
convulsively
with
every
sob
it
was
a
terrible
sight
to
see
judy
cry
and
molly
hoped
she
would
be
spared
such
another
experience
without
saying
another
word
molly
began
quietly
unpacking
the
trunks
and
putting
the
things
back
in
their
places
then
she
pulled
the
empty
trunks
into
the
hall
this
done
she
filled
a
basin
with
water
recklessly
poured
in
an
ample
quantity
of
judy
german
cologne
and
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
bed
began
bathing
her
friend
convulsed
and
swollen
face
gradually
judy
sobs
subsided
her
weary
eyelids
drooped
and
presently
she
dropped
off
into
a
deep
exhausted
sleep
nance
crept
into
the
room
she
all
right
now
whispered
molly
she
had
an
attack
of
the
but
it
passed
all
day
and
all
night
judy
slept
and
on
sunday
morning
she
was
her
old
self
once
more
gay
and
laughing
and
full
of
fun
that
afternoon
she
was
an
usher
at
vespers
in
wellington
chapel
with
molly
and
nance
and
wore
her
best
suit
and
a
big
black
velvet
hat
she
never
alluded
again
to
her
attack
of
wanderthirst
but
her
devotion
to
molly
deepened
and
strengthened
as
the
days
flew
by
until
it
became
as
real
to
her
as
her
love
for
her
mother
and
father
once
in
the
midst
of
the
dreaded
examinations
they
did
not
seem
so
dreadful
after
all
the
girls
at
queen
came
out
of
the
fight
with
some
wounds
but
still
breathing
as
margaret
wakefield
had
put
it
molly
had
a
condition
in
mathematics
i
got
it
because
i
expected
it
she
said
but
judy
came
through
with
flying
colors
not
a
single
black
mark
against
her
jessie
barely
pulled
through
and
her
friends
rejoiced
that
the
prettiest
most
frivolous
member
of
the
freshman
class
had
made
such
a
valiant
fight
and
won
chapter
xxiii
sophomores
at
last
freshman
arise
gird
on
thy
sword
captivity
is
to
arms
to
arms
for
lo
thou
art
a
daring
sophomore
the
words
of
this
stirring
song
floated
in
through
the
open
windows
at
queen
one
warm
night
in
early
june
moonlight
flooded
the
campus
and
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
perfume
of
lilac
and
syringa
a
group
of
sophomores
had
gathered
in
front
of
the
house
to
serenade
the
freshmen
at
queen
who
had
immediately
repaired
to
the
piazza
to
acknowledge
this
unusual
honor
paid
them
by
their
august
predecessors
i
think
it
would
be
far
more
appropriate
if
they
sang
all
the
saints
who
from
their
labors
rest
remarked
mabel
hinton
who
in
order
to
make
a
record
had
studied
herself
into
a
human
skeleton
well
said
molly
brown
when
i
left
home
last
september
one
of
my
brothers
cheerfully
informed
me
that
i
looked
like
rag
and
a
bone
and
a
hank
of
hair
i
am
afraid
i
do
feel
very
now
because
i
have
gained
ten
pounds
and
i
not
tired
of
anything
except
packing
my
clothes
i
so
sorry
to
leave
blessed
old
queen
that
i
could
kiss
her
brown
cheek
if
it
did
look
foolish
well
go
and
kiss
the
side
of
the
house
then
put
in
judy
you
have
a
poetic
nature
molly
but
i
would
have
it
changed
i
like
it
just
as
it
is
do
you
know
interrupted
margaret
wakefield
that
queen
from
having
once
been
scorned
as
a
residence
has
now
become
a
very
popular
abode
and
there
were
so
many
applications
for
rooms
here
for
next
year
that
the
registrar
has
had
to
make
a
waiting
list
for
the
first
time
in
connection
with
queen
think
of
that
at
old
queen
it
because
it
the
residence
of
a
distinguished
person
announced
molly
i
think
we
should
put
a
brass
plate
on
the
front
door
stating
that
in
this
house
lived
a
class
president
who
possessed
every
attribute
for
the
office
she
was
versed
in
parliamentary
law
she
had
an
executive
mind
and
she
was
beloved
by
all
who
knew
her
margaret
was
pleased
at
this
compliment
voyons
que
vous
me
flattez
she
exclaimed
it
your
warm
southern
nature
that
makes
you
so
enthusiastic
now
the
real
reason
why
old
brown
queen
with
her
moldering
vines
is
so
popular
all
of
a
sudden
is
because
you
are
here
it
was
molly
turn
now
to
be
pleased
we
wo
argue
such
a
personal
matter
she
said
squeezing
hand
but
i
glad
i
booked
here
for
next
year
i
was
afraid
nance
would
want
a
she
has
such
a
retiring
nature
me
exclaimed
nance
disregarding
english
in
her
amazement
why
had
the
happiest
winter
of
my
whole
life
with
you
molly
if
there
a
chance
for
another
one
like
it
i
only
too
thankful
certainly
mary
carmichael
washington
brown
is
a
modest
soul
thought
judy
who
happened
to
know
that
her
friend
had
had
some
five
or
six
tempting
offers
to
move
into
better
quarters
the
next
year
at
no
greater
expense
to
herself
one
was
from
mary
stewart
who
was
to
return
next
winter
for
a
course
another
was
from
judith
blount
who
had
proposed
molly
for
membership
in
the
beta
phi
society
next
year
and
had
furthermore
invited
the
surprised
young
freshman
to
take
the
study
of
her
apartment
for
a
bedroom
and
offered
her
the
constant
use
of
her
sumptuous
sitting
room
certainly
if
ever
there
was
an
expression
of
true
remorse
and
repentance
that
was
one
molly
thought
and
the
allusion
to
roommates
reminded
her
that
she
must
say
to
judith
for
there
would
be
no
time
in
the
morning
for
last
farewells
i
am
going
over
to
the
beta
phi
house
for
a
minute
she
announced
any
one
want
to
come
along
margaret
and
jessie
who
had
friends
in
that
abode
of
fashion
as
it
was
called
joined
her
and
presently
the
three
white
figures
were
lost
in
the
shadows
on
the
campus
she
is
going
to
say
farewell
to
judith
observed
judy
in
a
low
voice
to
nance
and
all
i
would
say
is
what
the
colored
preacher
said
the
change
his
spots
nance
smiled
gravely
she
did
not
possess
judy
prejudiced
nature
but
her
convictions
were
strong
do
you
think
she
a
judy
she
asked
she
may
be
a
domesticated
one
said
judy
of
the
genus
known
as
are
you
ashamed
judy
exclaimed
nance
reprovingly
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
a
few
doubts
still
lurked
in
her
own
heart
concerning
the
sincerity
of
proud
judith
repentance
in
the
meantime
the
three
freshmen
had
separated
in
the
upper
hall
of
the
beta
phi
house
and
molly
had
given
a
timid
rap
with
judith
fine
brass
knocker
instantly
the
door
flew
open
and
she
found
herself
precipitated
into
a
roomful
of
people
at
least
it
seemed
so
at
first
who
had
just
subsided
into
quiet
because
some
one
was
going
to
play
molly
was
about
to
retreat
in
great
confusion
when
miss
grace
green
seized
one
hand
and
mary
stewart
the
other
judith
came
forward
with
a
show
of
extreme
cordiality
and
richard
blount
left
the
piano
and
actually
ran
the
full
length
of
the
room
exclaiming
it
miss
molly
brown
of
kentucky
molly
knew
she
was
breaking
into
a
party
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
make
a
call
of
a
few
minutes
and
then
take
her
leave
as
gracefully
as
possible
under
the
circumstances
professor
edwin
green
had
also
shaken
her
by
the
hand
warmly
and
pushing
up
a
chair
had
insisted
on
her
sitting
down
they
had
all
drawn
their
chairs
around
her
in
a
semicircle
and
richard
blount
had
brought
over
the
piano
stool
and
placed
it
directly
in
front
of
her
so
that
he
could
look
straight
at
her
in
fact
here
sat
the
little
freshman
blushing
crimson
and
painfully
embarrassed
enthroned
in
a
large
armchair
and
gathered
around
her
was
a
circle
of
very
delightful
not
to
say
admiring
persons
as
one
of
these
persons
was
judith
brother
and
two
were
her
near
cousins
molly
thought
she
could
explain
their
excessive
cordiality
they
knew
the
story
of
the
ring
and
they
were
anxious
to
make
amends
she
recalled
with
a
furtive
inner
smile
the
last
time
she
was
in
those
rooms
when
as
a
waitress
she
had
upset
the
coffee
on
the
knees
how
glad
she
was
that
the
painful
experience
was
well
over
and
forgotten
by
now
but
she
was
glad
about
many
things
that
evening
she
was
happy
to
see
that
mary
and
judith
had
made
up
their
differences
and
were
once
more
friends
she
knew
that
mary
who
had
the
kindest
heart
in
the
world
could
never
stay
angry
long
i
did
know
that
judith
was
giving
a
party
molly
began
still
very
much
embarrassed
i
just
dropped
in
to
say
because
i
am
leaving
morning
morning
repeated
richard
blount
was
it
lucky
for
me
you
happened
in
i
had
expected
to
call
on
you
afternoon
and
think
how
disappointed
i
should
have
been
to
have
found
the
nest
empty
and
the
bird
flown
so
you
are
really
off
broke
in
professor
green
i
am
so
sorry
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
have
tea
in
the
cloisters
with
my
sister
and
me
in
the
afternoon
again
molly
smiled
to
herself
tea
in
the
cloisters
with
a
distinguished
professor
and
his
charming
sister
only
nine
months
before
she
had
been
a
lonely
shivering
little
waif
of
a
freshman
locked
in
the
cloisters
the
words
of
the
sophomore
croak
came
back
to
her
they
have
locked
me
in
the
cloisters
they
have
fastened
up
the
gate
oh
let
me
out
oh
let
me
out
it
growing
very
late
i
am
sorry
that
my
ticket
is
bought
and
my
berth
engaged
and
the
expressman
coming
for
my
trunk
at
nine
she
said
if
all
those
things
were
not
so
i
should
love
to
drink
soup
she
stopped
and
flushed
a
deep
red
what
absurd
trick
of
the
mind
had
made
her
say
soup
i
mean
tea
she
went
on
hastily
hoping
no
one
had
heard
the
break
miss
green
was
talking
with
mary
stewart
richard
blount
was
twirling
on
the
piano
stool
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
and
judith
was
engaged
at
a
side
table
in
pouring
lemonade
into
glasses
there
was
a
twinkle
of
amusement
in
the
professor
brown
eyes
and
he
gave
molly
a
delightful
smile
i
must
be
going
she
said
anxiously
rising
not
till
you
had
a
glass
of
lemonade
for
i
made
it
myself
said
richard
gallantly
handing
her
one
on
a
plate
molly
looked
doubtfully
toward
judith
i
do
want
to
be
like
that
young
man
in
the
rhyme
she
said
was
a
young
man
so
benighted
he
never
knew
when
he
was
slighted
he
go
to
a
party
and
eat
just
as
hearty
as
if
he
been
really
invited
everybody
laughed
and
judith
suddenly
becoming
a
model
hostess
exclaimed
indeed
you
must
stay
molly
and
have
some
lemonade
richard
make
it
at
all
he
only
squeezed
the
lemons
molly
therefore
remained
and
had
a
beautiful
time
and
when
she
really
did
take
her
departure
the
entire
party
including
judith
escorted
her
across
the
moonlit
campus
to
the
door
of
queen
but
molly
was
still
certain
that
it
was
the
ring
episode
and
nothing
else
that
made
them
all
so
polite
and
attentive
and
so
she
informed
nance
and
judy
that
night
as
she
unlocked
her
trunk
for
the
third
time
in
ten
minutes
to
stuff
in
some
overlooked
belonging
but
judy
sniffed
the
air
and
exclaimed
ring
nothing
it
popularity
molly
smiled
and
went
to
bed
feeling
that
her
last
day
at
wellington
had
been
a
decided
improvement
on
the
first
one
the
next
morning
queen
cottage
was
a
pandemonium
of
trunks
and
bags
and
excited
young
women
rushing
up
and
down
the
halls
cries
could
be
heard
from
every
room
in
the
house
of
the
laundress

brought

shirtwaists

the
bus
young
ladies

called
the
voice
of
markham
from
the
front
door
and
then
with
a
fluttering
of
handkerchiefs
and
many
a
last
call
of
the
of
girls
moved
sedately
down
the
avenue
molly
looking
back
at
the
twin
gray
towers
of
wellington
understood
why
frances
andrews
wanted
so
much
to
