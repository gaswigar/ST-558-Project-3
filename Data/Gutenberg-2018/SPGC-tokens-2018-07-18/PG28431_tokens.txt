the
irish
twins
by
lucy
fitch
perkins
in
this
short
book
the
author
conveys
a
very
good
image
of
the
lives
of
irish
country
children
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
images
drawn
by
the
very
talented
author
are
also
very
good
there
is
just
enough
of
the
irish
manner
of
speech
to
convey
the
flavour
of
the
way
the
twins
and
their
relatives
would
have
spoken
had
they
done
so
in
english
of
course
in
reality
it
is
likely
that
such
children
would
have
spoken
in
the
irish
language
instead
of
just
occasionally
using
an
irish
word
but
the
book
not
only
has
a
good
but
also
conveys
to
its
target
audience
american
children
something
of
the
background
of
their
irish
compatriots
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
grade
v
reader
and
published
in
is
the
third
of
the
twins
series
there
is
one
blunder
as
kathleen
the
daughter
of
the
earl
of
elsmore
is
referred
to
as
lady
kathleen
her
father
would
have
had
to
be
a
duke
or
a
marquess
for
that
address
to
be
correct
her
actual
title
does
not
sound
so
good
so
perhaps
perkins
can
be
forgiven
for
this
solecism
the
irish
twins
by
lucy
fitch
perkins
chapter
one
grannie
malone
and
the
twins
one
day
of
the
world
when
it
was
young
summer
in
ireland
old
grannie
malone
sat
by
her
fireplace
knitting
she
was
all
alone
and
in
her
lap
lay
a
letter
sometimes
she
took
the
letter
in
her
hands
and
turned
it
over
and
over
and
looked
at
it
then
she
would
put
it
down
again
with
a
little
sigh
if
i
but
had
the
learning
said
grannie
malone
to
herself
i
could
be
reading
michael
letters
without
calling
in
the
priest
and
is
long
since
he
passed
this
door
is
hard
work
waiting
until
some
one
can
tell
me
what
at
all
is
in
it
she
stooped
over
and
put
a
bit
of
peat
on
the
fire
and
because
she
had
no
one
else
to
talk
to
she
talked
to
the
there
now
she
said
to
it
is
a
lazy
bit
of
steam
that
coming
out
of
the
nose
of
you
i
be
wanting
my
tea
soon
and
no
water
boiling
she
lifted
the
lid
and
peeped
into
the
kettle
is
empty
entirely
she
cried
and
a
thirsty
kettle
it
is
surely
and
no
one
but
myself
to
fetch
and
carry
for
it
she
got
up
slowly
laid
her
knitting
and
the
letter
on
the
chair
took
the
kettle
off
the
hook
and
went
to
the
door
there
was
but
one
door
and
one
window
in
the
one
little
room
of
her
cabin
so
if
the
sun
had
not
been
shining
brightly
it
would
have
been
quite
dark
within
but
the
upper
half
of
the
door
stood
open
and
the
afternoon
sun
slanted
across
the
earthen
floor
and
brightened
the
dishes
that
stood
on
the
old
dresser
it
even
showed
grannie
malone
bed
in
the
far
end
of
the
room
and
some
of
her
clothes
hanging
from
the
rafters
overhead
there
was
little
else
in
the
room
to
see
except
her
chair
a
wooden
table
and
a
little
bench
by
the
fire
a
pile
of
peat
on
the
hearth
and
a
bag
of
potatoes
in
the
corner
grannie
malone
opened
the
lower
half
of
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
sunshine
some
speckled
hens
that
had
been
sunning
themselves
on
the
doorstep
fluttered
out
of
the
way
and
then
ran
after
her
to
the
well
shoo
get
along
with
you
cried
grannie
malone
she
flapped
her
apron
at
them

are
always
thinking
of
something
to
eat
sure
there
are
bugs

in
ireland

my
heels
to
be
fed

for
your
living
like
honest
hens
and
i
give

a
sup
of
water
if

the
well
had
a
stone
curb
around
it
and
a
bucket
with
a
rope
tied
to
it
stood
on
the
curb
grannie
let
the
bucket
down
into
the
well
until
she
heard
it
strike
the
fresh
spring
water
with
a
splash
then
she
pulled
and
pulled
on
the
rope
the
bucket
came
up
slowly
and
water
spilled
over
the
sides
as
grannie
lifted
it
to
the
curb
she
poured
some
of
the
water
into
the
dish
for
the
hens
filled
her
kettle
and
then
straightened
her
bent
back
and
stood
looking
at
the
little
cabin
and
the
brown
bog
beyond
sure
it
old
we
all
are
together
she
said
to
herself
nodding
her
head
the
old
cabin
with
the
rain
leaking
through
the
thatch
of
a
wet
day
and
the
old
well
with
moss
on
the
stones
of
it
and
the
hens
themselves
too
old
to
cook
and
too
old
to
be
laying
except
on
the
doorstep
in
the
sunshine
the
creatures
but
is
home
thanks
be
to
god
she
lifted
her
kettle
and
went
slowly
back
into
the
house
the
hens
followed
her
to
the
door
but
she
shut
the
lower
half
of
it
behind
her
and
left
them
outside
she
went
to
the
fireplace
and
hung
the
kettle
on
the
hook
blew
the
coals
to
a
blaze
with
a
pair
of
leaky
bellows
and
sat
down
before
the
fire
once
more
to
wait
for
the
water
to
boil
she
knit
round
and
round
her
stocking
and
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
but
the
of
her
needles
and
the
of
the
clock
and
the
little
purring
noise
of
the
fire
on
the
hearth
just
as
the
kettle
began
to
sing
there
was
a
squawking
among
the
hens
on
the
doorstep
and
two
dark
heads
appeared
above
the
closed
half
of
the
door
a
little
girl
voice
called
out
how
are
you
at
all
grannie
malone

a
little

and
picked
up
the
letter

a
little
bench
by

fireplace
and
grannie
malone
put

said
grannie
malone
then
she
opened
the
letter
and
a
bit
of
folded
green
paper
with
printing
on
it
fell
out
god

the
letter

the
twins
spread
the
sheet
open
and
studied
it
while
grannie
hovered
over
them
trembling
with
excitement
sure
that

it
said
eileen
pointing
to
the
first
word
sure
said
larry
letters
always
begin
like
that
dear

the
twins
patrick

eight
said
his
grandmother
but
surely
the
clever
children
like
yourselves
and
the
two
of
you
together
should
be
able
to
make
it
out
there
but
one
of
patrick
and
there
should
be
more
learning
between
the
two
of
you
than
in
one
alone
even
though
he
is
a
bit
older
try
now
larry
and
eileen
tried
this

and
a
strange
country
at

old
bones
in
but
i

a
proud
woman

any
country
of
the
world
and
he
an
alderman
there
was
a
letter
from
michael
himself
in
the
envelope
also
but
the
twins
could
not
read
that
however
much
they
tried
so
grannie
was
obliged
to
put
the
two
letters
and
the
green
paper
under
the
clock
over
the
fireplace
to
wait
until
the
priest
should
pass
that
way
chapter
two
the
sure
this
is
a
fine
day
for
me
altogether
said
grannie
malone
as
she
got
out
her
bit
of
flour
to
make
the
cake
i
can
wait
for
the
letter
from

the
way
i
know

health
and
have
not
forgotten
their
old
mother
troth
we
have
a
bit
of
a
feast
over
it
now
she
said
to
the
twins
while
i
throwing
the
cakeen
together
do
you
get
some
potatoes
from
the
bag
eileen
and
put
them
down
in
the
ashes
and
you
larry
stir
up
the
fire
a
bit
and
keep
the
kettle
full
sure
is
singing
away
like
a
bird
this
instant
minute
put
some
water
in
it
avic
and
then
shut
up
the
hens
for
me
eileen
ran
to
the
potato
bag
in
the
corner
and
took
out
four
potatoes
there
but
three
of
us
she
said
to
herself
but
larry
will
surely
be
wanting
two
himself
she
got
down
on
her
knees
and
buried
the
potatoes
in
the
burning
peat
then
she
took
a
little
broom
that
stood
near
by
and
tidied
up
the
hearth
larry
took
the
kettle
to
the
well
for
more
water
he
slopped
a
good
deal
of
it
as
he
came
back
it
made
great
spots
of
mud
for
there
was
no
wooden
floor
only
hard
earth
with
flat
stones
set
in
it
arrah
now
larry
you
do
be
slopping
things
up
the
equal
of
a
thunderstorm
eileen
said
to
him
never
you
mind
that
now
larry
said
grannie
malone
it
might
have
been
that
the
kettle
leaked
itself
and
no
fault
of
your
own
at
all
sure
a
bit
of
water
here
or
there
does
nobody
any
harm
she
hung
the
on
the
hook
over
the
fire
again
then
she
brought
the
cakeen
and
put
it
into
a
small
iron
and
put
a
cover
over
it
she
put
turf
on
top
of
the
cover
not
be
long
until
it
baked
said
grannie
and
you
can
be
watching
it
eileen
while
i
set
out
the
table
she
pulled
a
little
wooden
table
out
before
the
fire
put
three
plates
and
three
cups
on
it
some
salt
and
the
jug
of
milk
meanwhile
larry
was
out
trying
to
shut
the
hens
into
the
little
shelter
beside
the
house
but
he
could
get
them
all
in
one
old
speckled
hen
ran
round
the
house
to
the
door
larry
ran
after
her
the
hen
flew
up
on
top
of
the
she
was
very
much
excited
she
squawked
yourself
now
cried
grannie
malone
she
ran
toward
the
door
waving
her
spoon
shoo
along
out
of
this
with
your
bad
manners
she
cried
just
that
minute
larry
came
up
behind
the
hen
and
tried
to
catch
her
by
the
legs
squawked
old
speckle
and
up
she
flew
right
over
grannie
head
into
the
rafters
then
she
tucked
herself
cozily
down
to
go
to
sleep
did
you
ever
see
the
likes
of
that
old
speckle
now
cried
grannie
malone
she
ran
for
the
broom
sure
she
must
be
after
thinking
i
was
lonesome
for
a
bit
of
company

you
think
i
be
wanting
you
at
all
you
silly
when
i
have
the
twins
by
me
she
said
to
the
hen
she
shook
the
broom
at
her
but
old
speckle
was
a
bit
afraid
of
grannie
she
did
move
then
grannie
malone
put
the
broom
under
her
and
tried
to
lift
her
from
her
perch
but
old
speckle
had
made
up
her
mind
to
stay
so
she
flew
across
to
another
rafter
and
lit
on
grannie
malone
black
coat
that
she
wore
to
mass
on
sundays
she
thought
it
a
pleasant
warm
place
and
sat
down
again

you
for
an
old
thief

grannie

my
sunday
cloak

your
muddy
feet

me
entirely
she
shook
the
cloak
then
old
speckle
squawking
all
the
way
flew
over
to
grannie
bed
she
ran
the
whole
length
of
it
she
left
a
little
path
clear
across
the
patchwork
quilt
larry
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
room
waving
his
arms
eileen
was
flapping
her
apron
in
another
while
grannie
malone
chased
old
speckle
with
the
broom
at
last
with
a
final
squawk
she
flew
out
of
the
door
and
ran
round
to
the
shelter
where
the
other
hens
were
and
went
in
as
if
she
thought
home
was
the
best
place
for
a
hen
after
all
larry
shut
her
in
as
soon
as
the
hen

drew
her

on
the
bench

the
other

herself
and
then
they
each
took
a

and
broke

eileen
well
then

grannie

daughter
to
her
and
that
not
far
behind
whist
now
till
i
tell
you
the
story
of
the
little
cakeen
and
you
see
that
is
a
good
thing
entirely
to
behave
yourselves
and
grow
up
fine
and
respectable
like
the
lad
in
the
tale
it
goes
like
this
now
it
was
once
long
ago
in
old
ireland
there
was
living
a
fine
clean
honest
poor
widow
woman
and
she
having
two
sons
note
and
she
fetched
the
both
of
them
up
fine
and
careful
but
one
of
them
turned
out
bad
entirely
and
one
day
she
says
to
him
says
she
given
you
your
living
as
long
as
ever
i
can
and
it
you
must
go
out
into
the
wide
world
and
seek
your
fortune
i
will
says
he
will
you
take
a
big
cake
with
my
curse
or
a
little
cake
with
my
blessing
says
she
big
cake
sure
says
he
so
she
baked
a
big
cake
and
cursed
him
and
he
went
away
laughing
by
and
by
he
came
forninst
a
spring
in
the
woods
and
sat
down
to
eat
his
dinner
off
the
cake
and
a
small
little
bird
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
spring
me
a
bit
of
your
cake
for
my
little
ones
in
the
nest
said
she
and
he
caught
up
a
stone
and
threw
at
her
scarce
enough
for
myself
says
he
and
she
being
a
fairy
put
her
beak
in
the
spring
and
turned
it
black
as
ink
and
went
away
up
in
the
trees
and
whiles
he
looked
for
a
stone
for
to
kill
her
a
fox
went
away
with
his
cake
so
he
went
away
from
that
place
very
mad
and
next
day
he
stopped
very
hungry
at
a
farmer
house
and
hired
out
for
to
tend
the
cows
wise
says
the
farmer
wife
the
next
field
is
belonging
to
a
giant
and
if
the
cows
get
into
the
clover
he
will
kill
you
dead
as
a
stone
but
the
bad
son
laughed
and
went
out
to
watch
the
cows
and
before
noontime
he
went
to
sleep
up
in
the
tree
and
the
cows
all
went
in
the
clover
and
out
comes
the
giant
and
shook
him
down
out
of
the
tree
and
killed
him
dead
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
bad
son
and
the
next
year
the
poor
widow
woman
says
to
the
good
son
must
go
out
into
the
wide
world
and
seek
your
fortune
for
i
can
keep
you
no
longer
says
the
mother
i
will
says
he
will
you
take
a
big
cake
with
my
curse
or
a
little
cake
with
my
blessing
little
cake
says
he
so
she
baked
it
for
him
and
gave
him
her
blessing
and
he
went
away
and
she
after
him
fine
and
loud
and
by
and
by
he
came
to
the
same
spring
in
the
woods
where
the
bad
son
was
before
him
and
the
small
little
bird
sat
again
on
the
side
of
it
me
a
bit
of
your
cakeen
for
my
little
ones
in
the
nest
says
she
will
says
the
good
son
and
he
broke
her
off
a
fine
piece
and
she
dipped
her
beak
in
the
spring
and
turned
it
into
sweet
wine
and
when
he
bit
into
his
cake
sure
it
was
turned
into
fine
entirely
and
he
ate
and
drank
and
went
on
and
next
day
he
comes
to
the
farmer
house
ye
tend
the
cows
for
me
says
the
farmer
will
says
the
good
son
wise
says
the
farmer
wife
the
beyond
is
belonging
to
a
giant
and
if
you
leave
in
the
cows
he
will
kill
you
dead
fear
says
the
good
son
do
sleep
at
my
work
and
he
goes
out
in
the
field
and
lugs
a
big
stone
up
in
the
tree
and
then
sends
every
cow
far
out
in
the
and
goes
back
again
to
the
tree
and
out
comes
the
giant
so
you
could
hear
the
roars
of
him
a
mile
away
and
when
he
finds
the
he
goes
under
the
tree
to
shake
him
down
but
the
good
little
son
slips
out
the
big
stone
and
it
fell
down
and
broke
the
giant
head
entirely
so
the
good
son
went
running
away
to
the
giant
house
and
it
being
full
to
the
eaves
of
gold
and
diamonds
and
splendid
things
so
you
see
what
fine
luck
comes
to
folks
that
is
good
and
honest
and
he
went
home
and
fetched
his
old
mother
and
they
lived
rich
and
contented
and
died
very
old
and
respected
do
you
suppose
your
son
michael
killed
any
giants
in
america
the
way
he
got
to
be
an
alderman
asked
eileen
when
grannie
had
finished
her
story
i
do
rightly
know
that
grannie
answered
maybe
it
was
just
exactly
giants
but
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
he
is
rich
and
respected
and
he
with
a
silk
hat
and
riding
in
a
procession
the
same
as
the
himself
did
you
ever
see
a
giant
or
a
fairy
or
any
of
the
good
little
people
themselves
grannie
malone
larry
asked
i
never
exactly
seen
any
of
them
with
my
own
two
eyes
she
answered
but
many
is
the
time
i
talked
with
people
and
they
having
seen
them
there
was
mary
now
dead
long
since
god
rest
her
she
told
me
this
tale
herself
and
she
sitting
by
this
very
hearth
wait
now
till
i
wet
my
mouth
with
a
sup
of
tea
in
it
and
i
be
telling
you
the
tale
the
very
same
way
she
told
it
herself
note
adapted
from
marygold
house
in
by
sarah
orne
jewett
chapter
three
the
tale
of
the
leprechaun
grannie
reached
for
the
teapot
and
poured
herself
a
cup
of
tea
as
she
sipped
it
she
said
to
the
twins
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
leprechauns
little
men
they
are
not
half
the
bigness
of
the
smallest
baby
you
ever
laid
your
two
eyes
on
long
beards
they
have
and
little
pointed
caps
on
the
heads
of
them
and
it
forever
making
the
little
brogues
shoes
they
are
and
you
can
hear
the
of
their
hammers
before
you
ever
get
sight
of
them
at
all
and
the
gold
and
silver
and
precious
things
they
have
hidden
away
would
fill
the
world
with
treasures
but
they
have
the
sharpness
of
the
new
moon
that
sharp
at
both
ends
and
no
one
can
get
their
riches
away
from
them
at
all
they
do
be
saying
that
if
you
catch
one
in
your
two
hands
and
never
take
your
eyes
off
him
you
can
make
him
give
up
his
money
but
they
the
tricks
of
the
world
to
make
you
look
the
other
way
the
leprechauns
have
and
then
when
you
look
back
again
faith
nowhere
at
all
did
mary
catch
one
asked
eileen
did
she
now
cried
grannie
listen
to
this
one
day
mary
was
sitting
in
her
bit
of
garden
with
her
knitting
in
her
hand
and
she
was
watching
some
bees
that
were
going
to
swarm
it
was
a
fine
day
in
june
and
the
bees
were
humming
and
the
birds
were
chirping
and
hopping
and
the
butterflies
were
flying
about
and
everything
smelt
as
sweet
and
fresh
as
if
it
was
the
first
day
of
the
world
well
all
of
a
sudden
what
did
she
hear
among
the
in
the
garden
but
a
noise
that
went
just
for
all
the
world
as
if
a
was
putting
on
the
heel
of
a
pump
lord
preserve
us
says
mary
in
the
world
can
that
be
so
she
laid
down
her
knitting
and
she
went
over
to
the
beans
now
never
believe
me
if
she
did
see
sitting
right
before
her
a
bit
of
an
old
man
with
a
cocked
hat
on
his
head
and
a
dudeen
pipe
in
his
mouth
smoking
away
he
had
on
a
coat
with
big
brass
buttons
on
it
and
a
pair
of
silver
buckles
on
his
shoes
and
he
working
away
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
heeling
a
little
pair
of
pumps
you
may
believe
me
or
not
larry
and
eileen
mcqueen
but
the
minute
she
clapped
her
eyes
on
him
she
knew
him
for
a
leprechaun
and
she
says
to
him
very
bold
save
you
honest
man
that
hard
work
you
at
this
hot
day
and
she
made
a
run
at
him
and
caught
him
in
her
two
hands
where
is
your
purse
of
money
says
she
says
he
is
it
and
where
on
top
of
earth
would
an
old
creature
like
myself
get
money
says
he
not
on
top
of
earth
at
all
but
it
says
she
and
with
that
she
gave
him
a
bit
of
a
squeeze
come
says
she
be
turning
your
tricks
upon
an
honest
woman
and
then
she
being
at
the
time
as
a
young
woman
as
find
put
a
wicked
face
on
her
and
pulled
a
knife
from
her
pocket
and
says
she
you
do
give
me
your
purse
this
instant
minute
or
show
me
a
pot
of
gold
i
cut
the
nose
off
the
face
of
you
as
soon
as
wink
the
little
man
eyes
were
popping
out
of
his
head
with
fright
and
says
he
with
me
a
couple
of
fields
off
and
i
show
you
where
i
keep
my
money
so
she
went
still
holding
him
fast
in
her
hand
and
keeping
her
two
eyes
fixed
on
him
without
so
much
as
a
wink
when
all
of
a
sudden
what
do
you
think
she
heard
a
whiz
and
a
buzz
behind
her
as
if
all
the
bees
in
the
world
were
humming
and
the
little
old
man
cries
out
go
your
bees
and
off
with
themselves
like
blazes
she
turned
her
head
for
no
more
than
a
second
of
time
but
when
she
looked
back
there
was
nothing
at
all
in
her
hand
he
slipped
out
of
her
fingers
as
if
he
were
made
of
fog
or
smoke
and
sorrow
a
bit
of
him
did
she
ever
see
after
note
and
she
never
got
the
gold
at
all
sighed
eileen
never
so
much
as
a
worth
said
grannie
malone
i
believe
i
rather
get
rich
in
america
than
try
to
catch
leprechauns
for
a
living
said
larry
and
you
never
said
a
truer
word
said
grannie
is
a
poor
living
you
get
from
the
leprechauns
i
thinking
rich
as
they
are
by
this
time
the
teapot
was
empty
and
every
crumb
of
the
cakeen
was
gone
and
as
larry
had
eaten
two
potatoes
just
as
eileen
thought
he
would
there
was
little
left
to
clear
away
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
the
room
had
grown
darker
and
grannie
malone
went
to
the
little
window
and
looked
out
now
run
along
with
yourselves
home
she
said
for
the
sun
is
nearly
setting
across
the
bog
and
your
mother
will
be
looking
for
you
here
put
this
in
your
pocket
for
luck
she
gave
larry
a
little
piece
of
coal
the
good
little
people
will
take
care
of
good
children
if
they
have
a
bit
o
this
with
them
she
said
and
you
eileen
be
careful
that
you
do
step
in
a
fairy
ring
on
your
way
home
for
you
a
light
foot
on
you
like
a
leaf
in
the
wind
and
people
will
keep
you
dancing
for
dear
knows
how
long
if
once
they
get
you
we
keep
right
in
the
boreen
road
wo
we
larry
grannie
said
eileen
the
twins
started
home
grannie
malone
stood
in
her
doorway
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
and
looking
after
them
until
a
turn
in
the
road
hid
them
from
sight
then
she
went
into
her
little
cabin
and
shut
the
door
note
adapted
from
thomas
keightley
chapter
four
the
tinkers
after
larry
and
eileen
had
gone
around
the
turn
in
the
road
there
were
no
houses
in
sight
for
quite
a
long
distance
on
one
side
of
the
road
stretched
the
brown
bog
with
here
and
there
a
pool
of
water
in
it
which
shone
bright
in
the
colours
of
the
setting
sun
it
was
gay
too
with
patches
of
yellow
buttercups
of
primroses
and
golden
whins
the
whins
had
been
in
bloom
since
easter
for
larry
and
eileen
had
gathered
the
yellow
flowers
to
dye
their
easter
eggs
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
the
land
rose
a
little
and
was
so
covered
with
stones
that
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
no
earth
left
for
things
to
grow
in
yet
the
mountain
fern
took
root
there
and
made
the
rocks
gay
with
its
green
fronds
the
sun
was
so
low
that
their
shadows
stretched
far
across
the
bogland
beside
them
as
the
twins
trudged
along
three
black
ravens
were
flying
overhead
and
a
lark
was
singing
its
evening
song
eileen
looked
up
in
the
sky
there
the
ghost
of
a
moon
up
there
look
larry
she
said
larry
looked
up
there
floating
high
above
them
was
a
pale
pale
moon
almost
the
colour
of
the
sky
itself
it
looks
queer
and
lonesome
up
there
he
said
and
there
no
luck
at
all
in
three
ravens
flying
they
be
putting
a
grudge
on
somebody
cow
maybe
i
wonder
where
the
little
lark
does
be
hiding
herself
larry
was
still
looking
up
in
the
sky
for
the
little
lark
when
eileen
suddenly
seized
his
arm
whist
larry
she
whispered
look
before
you
on
the
road
larry
stopped
and
looked
a
man
was
coming
toward
them
the
man
was
still
a
long
way
off
but
they
could
see
that
he
carried
something
on
his
back
and
beside
the
road
not
so
far
away
from
where
the
twins
stood
there
was
a
camp
like
a
gypsy
camp
is
the
tinkers
whispered
larry
he
took
eileen
hand
and
pulled
her
with
him
behind
a
heap
of
stones
by
the
road
then
they
crept
along
very
quietly
and
climbed
over
the
wall
into
a
field
from
behind
the
wall
they
could
peep
between
the
stones
at
the
camp
without
being
seen
the
twins
were
afraid
of
tinkers
everybody
is
in
ireland
because
the
tinkers
wander
around
over
the
country
without
having
any
homes
anywhere
they
go
from
house
to
house
in
all
the
villages
mending
the
pots
and
pans
and
often
they
steal
whatever
they
can
lay
their
hands
on
at
night
they
sleep
on
the
ground
with
only
straw
for
a
bed
and
they
cook
in
a
kettle
over
a
the
twins
were
so
badly
scared
that
their
teeth
chattered
eileen
was
the
first
to
say
anything
however
will
we
home
at
all
she
whispered
they
a
dog
with
them
and
he
at
us
surely
maybe
he
bite
us
they
could
see
a
woman
moving
about
through
the
camp
she
had
a
fire
with
a
kettle
hanging
over
it
there
were
two
or
three
other
people
about
and
some
horses
the
dog
was
lying
beside
the
fire
and
there
was
a
baby
rolling
about
on
the
ground
a
little
pig
was
tied
by
one
hind
leg
to
a
if
the
dog
comes
after
us
said
larry
i
drop
a
stone
on
him
out
of
a
tree
just
the
way
the
good
son
did
in
the
story
and
kill
him
dead
but
there
never
a
tree
anywhere
about
said
eileen
sure
that
is
no
plan
at
all
that
a
true
word
said
larry
when
he
had
looked
all
about
for
a
tree
and
found
none
we
have
to
think
of
something
else
then
he
thought
and
thought
we
might
go
back
to
grannie
he
said
after
a
while
that
would
be
no
better
eileen
whispered
for
surely
our
mother
would
go
crazy
with
worrying
if
we
did
come
home
at
all
and
we
already
so
late
well
then
larry
answered
we
must
just
bide
here
until
it
dark
and
creep
by
the
best
way
we
can
anyway
i
the
piece
of
coal
in
my
pocket
and
grannie
said
no
harm
would
come
to
us
at
all
and
we
having
it
just
then
the
man
who
had
been
coming
up
the
road
reached
the
camp
the
dog
ran
out
to
meet
him
barking
joyfully
the
man
came
near
the
fire
and
threw
the
bundle
off
his
shoulder
it
was
two
fat
geese
with
their
legs
tied
together
the
saints
preserve
us
whispered
eileen
if
those
are
our
own
two
geese
do
you
see
those
black
feathers
in
their
wings
he
the
thief
of
the
world
said
larry
he
forgot
to
be
frightened
because
he
was
so
angry
and
he
spoke
right
out
loud
he
stood
up
and
shook
his
fist
at
the
tinker
his
head
showed
over
the
top
of
the
wall
eileen
jerked
him
down
whist
now
larry
darling
she
begged
if
the
dog
sees
you
once
tear
you
to
pieces
larry
dropped
behind
the
wall
again
and
they
watched
the
tinker
wife
loosen
the
string
about
the
legs
of
the
geese
and
tie
them
by
a
long
cord
to
the
bush
beside
the
little
pig
then
all
the
tinker
people
gathered
around
the
pot
and
began
to
eat
their
supper
the
baby
and
the
dog
were
on
the
ground
playing
together
the
twins
could
hear
the
shouts
of
the
baby
and
the
barks
of
the
dog
it
was
quite
dusk
by
this
time
but
the
moon
grew
brighter
and
brighter
in
the
sky
and
the
flames
of
the
tinkers
fire
glowed
more
and
more
red
as
the
night
came
on
sure
it
is
going
to
get
real
dark
at
all
whispered
larry
then
we
better
be
going
now
said
eileen
for
the
tinkers
are
eating
their
supper
and
their
backs
are
towards
the
road
and
make
hardly
a
taste
of
noise
with
our
bare
feet
they
crept
along
behind
the
rocks
and
over
the
wall
now
whispered
larry
slip
along
until
we
right
beside
them
and
then
run
like
the
wind
the
twins
took
hold
of
hands
they
could
hear
their
hearts
beat
they
walked
softly
up
the
road
the
tinkers
were
still
laughing
and
talking
the
baby
and
the
dog
kept
on
playing
the
twins
were
almost
by
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
geese
stood
up
squawk
squawk
they
cried
squawk
squawk
whatever
is
the
matter
with
you
now
said
the
tinker
wife
to
the
geese
ca
you
be
quiet
the
dog
stopped
romping
with
the
baby
sniffed
the
air
and
growled
lie
down
said
the
woman
there
a
bone
for
your
supper
she
threw
the
dog
a
bone
he
sprang
at
it
and
began
to
gnaw
it
larry
and
eileen
had
crouched
behind
a
rock
the
minute
the
geese
began
to
squawk
i
believe
they
know
us
whispered
eileen
they
waited
until
everything
was
quiet
again
then
larry
whispered
run
now
and
if
you
fall
never
wait
to
rise
but
run
till
we
get
to
tom
daly
house
then
they
ran
the
soft
of
their
bare
feet
on
the
dirt
road
was
not
heard
by
the
tinkers
and
soon
another
turn
in
the
road
hid
them
from
view
but
for
all
that
they
ran
and
ran
ever
so
far
until
some
houses
were
in
sight
they
could
see
the
flicker
of
firelight
in
the
windows
of
the
nearest
house
it
was
tom
daly
house
they
could
see
tom
shadow
as
he
sat
at
his
loom
weaving
flax
into
beautiful
white
linen
cloth
they
could
hear
the
clack
clack
of
his
loom
it
made
the
twins
feel
much
safer
to
hear
this
sound
and
see
tom
shadow
for
tom
was
a
friend
of
theirs
and
they
often
went
into
his
house
and
watched
him
weave
his
beautiful
linen
which
was
so
fine
that
the
queen
herself
used
it
up
the
road
in
the
window
of
the
last
house
of
all
a
candle
shone
sure
mother
is
watching
for
us
said
larry
she
put
a
candle
in
the
window
they
went
on
more
slowly
now
past
tom
daly
past
the
maguires
and
the
and
several
other
houses
on
the
way
and
when
they
were
quite
near
their
own
home
larry
said
sure
i
never
travel
again
without
a
bit
of
coal
in
my
pocket
look
at
all
the
danger
we
been
in
this
night
and
never
the
smallest
thing
happening
to
us
and
eileen
said
indeed
musha
is
well
we
the
good
children
sure
the
good
little
people
would
never
at
all
let
harm
come
to
the
likes
of
us
just
as
grannie
said
chapter
five
the
twins
get
home
when
they
were
nearly
home
the
twins
saw
a
dark
figure
hurrying
down
the
road
and
as
it
drew
near
their
mother
voice
called
to
them
is
it
yourselves
larry
and
eileen
and
whatever
kept
you
till
this
hour
sure
you
had
me
distracted
entirely
with
wondering
what
had
become
of
you
at
all
and
your
dada
sits
in
the
room
with
a
lip
on
him
as
long
as
and
the
twins
both
began
to
talk
at
once
their
mother
clapped
her
hands
over
her
ears
ca
you
hold
your
tongues
and
speak
quietly
now
one
at
a
time
like
gentlemen
and
ladies
she
said
come
in
to
your
father
and
tell
him
all
about
it
the
twins
each
took
one
of
her
hands
and
they
all
three
hurried
into
the
house
they
went
into
the
kitchen
their
father
was
sitting
by
the
chimney
with
his
feet
up
smoking
his
pipe
when
they
came
in
he
brought
his
feet
to
the
floor
with
a
thump
and
sat
up
straight
in
his
chair
where
have
you
been
you
spalpeens
he
said
it
nine
this
instant
minute
the
twins
both
began
again
to
talk
their
mother
flew
about
the
kitchen
to
get
them
a
bite
of
supper
come
now
said
the
father
i
ca
hear
myself
at
all
with
the
noise
of
you
do
you
tell
the
tale
larry
then
larry
told
them
about
the
cakeen
and
the
silk
hat
and
michael
malone
and
the
tinkers
while
his
mother
said
the
saints
preserve
us
every
few
words
and
eileen
interrupted
to
tell
how
brave
larry
had
been
just
like
the
good
son
in
grannie
malone
tale
for
all
the
world
but
when
they
came
to
the
geese
part
of
the
story
the
father
said
blathers
and
got
up
and
hurried
out
to
the
place
where
the
fowls
were
kept
in
the
yard
behind
the
house
in
a
few
minutes
he
came
in
again
the
geese
are
gone
he
said
and
that
the
truth
or
i
ca
speak
it
bad
luck
to
the
thieves
then
cried
the
mother
the
back
of
my
hand
to
them
sure
i
saw
a
rough
scraggly
man
with
a
beard
on
him
like
a
rick
of
hay
come
along
this
very
afternoon
and
i
up
the
road
talking
with
mrs
maguire
i
never
thought
he
make
that
bold
to
carry
off
geese
in
the
broad
light
of
day
and
me
saving
them
against
christmastime
too
wait
till
i
get
that
fellow
where
beating
is
cheap
and
i
take
the
change
out
of
him
said
the
father
eileen
began
to
cry
and
larry
lip
trembled
come
here
now
you
poor
dears
their
mother
said
sit
down
on
the
two
creepeens
by
the
fire
and
have
a
bite
to
eat
before
you
go
to
bed
indeed
you
must
be
starved
entirely
with
the
running
and
the
fright
and
all
i
give
you
a
drink
of
cold
milk
warmed
up
with
a
sup
of
hot
water
through
it
and
a
bit
of
bread
to
comfort
your
stomachs
while
the
twins
ate
the
bread
and
drank
the
milk
their
father
and
mother
talked
about
the
tinkers
sure
they
are
as
a
frost
in
spring
and
a
blight
in
harvest
said
mrs
mcqueen
i
wonder
wherever
they
got
the
badness
in
them
the
way
they
have
i
heard
said
it
was
a
tinker
that
led
saint
patrick
astray
when
he
was
in
ireland
said
mr
mcqueen
i
do
know
if
it
true
or
not
but
the
tale
is
that
he
was
brought
here
a
slave
and
that
it
would
take
a
hundred
pounds
to
buy
his
freedom
one
day
when
he
was
minding
the
sheep
on
the
hills
he
found
a
lump
of
silver
and
he
met
a
tinker
and
asked
him
the
value
of
it
says
the
tinker
naught
but
a
bit
of
solder
give
it
to
me
but
saint
patrick
took
it
to
a
smith
instead
and
the
smith
told
him
the
truth
about
it
and
saint
patrick
put
a
curse
on
the
tinkers
that
every
man
face
should
be
against
them
and
that
they
should
get
no
rest
at
all
but
to
follow
the
road
some
say
they
do
be
walking
the
world
forever
said
mrs
mcqueen
and
i
never
in
my
life
met
any
one
that
had
seen
a
tinker
funeral
there
maybe
be
one
if
i
catch
the
tinker
that
stole
the
geese
mr
mcqueen
said
grimly
mrs
mcqueen
laughed
it
the
fierce
one
you
are
to
talk
she
said
and
you
that
when
you
angry
that
you
scare
not
even
a
fly
come
along
now
to
bed
with
you
she
added
to
the
twins
there
you
sit
with
your
eyes
dropping
out
of
your
heads
with
sleep
she
helped
them
undress
and
popped
them
into
their
beds
in
the
next
room
then
she
barred
the
door
put
out
the
candle
covered
the
coals
in
the
fireplace
and
went
to
bed
in
the
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
kitchen
last
of
all
mr
mcqueen
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
against
the
and
soon
everything
was
quiet
in
their
cottage
and
in
the
whole
village
of
ballymora
where
they
lived
chapter
six
how
they
went
to
the
bog
the
next
morning
when
the
twins
woke
up
the
sun
was
shining
in
through
the
one
little
square
window
in
the
bedroom
and
lay
in
a
bright
patch
of
yellow
on
the
floor
eileen
sat
up
in
bed
and
rubbed
her
eyes
then
she
stuck
her
head
out
between
the
curtains
of
her
bed
is
it
or
i
do
know
she
said
larry
sat
up
in
his
bed
and
rubbed
his
eyes
he
peeped
out
from
his
curtains
it
is
yesterday
anyway
he
said
and
glad
i
am
for
that
do
you
mind
about
the
tinkers
eileen
i
do
so
said
eileen
and
the
geese
their
mother
heard
them
and
came
to
the
door
sure
i
thought
i
let
you
sleep
as
late
as
ever
you
liked
she
said
for
there
no
school
but
you
awake
and
clacking
so
how
would
you
like
to
go
with
your
dada
to
the
bog
to
cut
turf
himself
will
put
a
bit
of
bread
in
his
pocket
for
you
and
you
can
take
a
sup
of
milk
along
oh
wirra
cried
eileen
what
have
we
done
but
left
the
at
grannie
malone
you
can
take
the
milk
in
the
old
brown
jug
then
said
the
mother
and
come
along
home
by
way
of
grannie
and
get
the
jug
itself
like
your
father
to
get
a
sight
of
the
tinkers
camp
and
maybe
of
that
thief
of
the
world
that
stole
the
geese
on
us
it
did
take
the
twins
long
to
dress
they
wore
few
clothes
and
no
shoes
and
stockings
and
their
breakfast
of
bread
and
potatoes
was
soon
eaten
the
mother
had
already
milked
the
cow
and
when
they
had
had
a
drink
of
fresh
milk
they
were
ready
to
start
mr
mcqueen
was
at
the
door
with
colleen
the
donkey
and
when
larry
and
eileen
came
out
he
put
them
both
on
colleen
back
and
they
started
down
the
road
toward
the
bog
when
they
came
to
the
place
where
the
tinkers
camp
should
be
there
was
no
camp
there
at
all
they
looked
east
and
west
but
no
sign
of
the
tinkers
did
they
see
if
it
were
not
for
the
two
geese
gone
i
think
you
had
been
dreaming
said
mr
mcqueen
to
the
twins
look
there
then
said
larry
sure
there
the
black
mark
on
the
ground
where
their
fire
was
the
twins
slid
off
colleen
back
and
ran
to
the
spot
where
the
camp
had
been
there
indeed
was
the
mark
of
a
fire
and
near
by
were
some
wisps
of
straw
there
were
the
marks
of
horses
feet
too
and
eileen
found
a
white
goose
feather
by
the
and
a
piece
of
broken
rope
they
were
here
surely
mr
mcqueen
said
and
far
enough
away
they
are
by
this
time
no
doubt
it
likely
the
police
were
after
them
they
went
back
to
the
road
and
the
twins
got
up
again
on
back
and
soon
they
had
reached
the
near
end
of
the
bog
mr
mcqueen
stopped
i
be
cutting
the
turf
here
he
said
and
the
two
of
you
can
go
on
to
grannie
malone
with
the
donkey
and
bring
back
the
jug
with
yourselves
get
along
with
you
and
he
gave
the
donkey
a
slap
the
twins
and
the
donkey
started
along
the
road
everything
went
well
until
colleen
spied
a
tuft
of
green
thistles
on
a
high
bank
beside
the
road
colleen
loved
thistles
and
she
made
straight
for
them
the
first
thing
the
twins
knew
they
were
sliding
swiftly
down
the
back
while
colleen
stood
with
her
fore
feet
high
on
the
bank
and
her
hind
feet
in
the
road
larry
being
behind
landed
first
with
eileen
on
top
of
him
she
was
hurt
a
bit
but
she
was
a
little
scared
sure
larry
but
you
the
soft
one
to
fall
on
she
said
as
she
rolled
over
and
picked
herself
up
i
may
be
soft
to
fall
on
said
larry
but
i
the
easier
squashed
for
that
look
at
me
now
it
out
of
shape
i
am
entirely
with
the
print
of
yourself
on
me
then
whatever
will
we
do
with
colleen
eileen
said
she
got
her
nose
in
the
thistles
and
we
never
be
able
to
drag
her
away
from
them
they
pulled
on
the
halter
but
colleen
refused
to
budge
larry
got
up
on
the
bank
and
pushed
her
he
even
pulled
her
backward
by
the
tail
colleen
did
seem
to
mind
it
at
all
she
kept
right
on
eating
the
thistles
at
last
larry
said
you
go
on
with
yourself
to
grannie
malone
for
the
jug
eileen
and
i
stay
here
until
she
finishes
the
thistles
so
he
sat
down
by
the
road
on
a
stone
and
eileen
trotted
off
to
grannie
chapter
seven
the
bog
when
eileen
got
back
with
the
jug
she
found
larry
still
sitting
beside
the
road
he
was
talking
with
a
boy
and
colleen
head
was
still
in
the
thistles
the
top
of
the
morning
to
you
dennis
maguire
eileen
called
to
the
freckled
boy
when
she
saw
him
and
does
it
take
the
two
of
you
to
watch
one
donkey
at
his
breakfast
come
along
and
let
play
in
the
bog
but
however
shall
we
leave
colleen
she
might
run
away
on
us
said
larry
she
tethered
by
hunger
fast
enough
said
eileen
ropes
would
not
drag
her
away
but
you
could
throw
her
halter
over
a
stone
to
be
sure
larry
slipped
the
halter
over
a
stone
they
set
the
in
a
safe
place
and
the
three
children
ran
off
into
the
bog
the
bogland
was
brown
and
dark
tufts
of
coarse
grass
grew
here
and
there
and
patches
of
yellow
gorse
there
were
many
puddles
and
sometimes
there
were
deep
holes
where
the
turf
had
been
cut
out
mr
mcqueen
was
a
thrifty
man
and
got
his
supply
of
turf
early
in
the
season
he
would
cut
it
out
in
long
black
blocks
like
thick
mud
and
leave
it
in
the
sun
to
dry
when
it
was
quite
dry
he
would
carry
it
home
on
colleen
back
pile
it
in
a
high
near
the
kitchen
door
and
it
would
burn
in
the
fireplace
all
winter
the
children
were
barefooted
so
they
played
in
the
puddles
as
much
as
ever
they
liked
by
and
by
eileen
said
let
play
we
are
deirdre
and
the
sons
of
usnach
and
who
were
they
indeed
said
dennis
it
was
grannie
told
us
about
them
said
eileen
and
sure
it
the
sorrowfullest
story
in
ireland
then
let
not
be
playing
it
said
dennis
but
there
kings
in
it
and
lots
of
fighting
well
then
it
might
not
be
so
bad
at
all
tell
the
rest
of
it
dennis
answered
well
then
eileen
began
there
once
was
a
high
king
of
emain
and
his
name
was
conchubar
pronounced
and
one
time
when
he
was
hunting
out
in
the
fields
he
heard
a
small
little
cry
crying
and
he
followed
the
sound
of
it
and
what
should
he
find
but
a
little
baby
girl
lying
alone
in
the
field
well
listen
to
that
now
said
dennis
he
did
so
eileen
went
on
and
he
loved
the
child
and
took
her
to
his
castle
and
had
her
brought
up
fine
and
careful
intending
for
to
marry
her
when
she
should
be
grown
up
and
he
hid
her
away
with
only
an
old
woman
to
take
care
of
her
in
a
beautiful
house
far
in
the
mountain
for
he
was
afraid
she
be
stolen
away
from
him
and
she
had
silver
dishes
and
golden
cups
and
everything
fine
and
elegant
and
she
the
most
beautiful
creature
you
ever
laid
your
two
eyes
on
sure
i
do
see
much
fighting
in
the
tale
at
all
said
dennis
whist
now
and
i
come
to
it
eileen
answered
one
day
when
deirdre
had
grown
to
be
a
fine
big
girl
she
looks
out
of
the
window
and
she
sees
naisi
pronounced
going
along
by
with
his
two
brothers
the
three
of
them
together
they
having
been
hunting
in
the
mountain
and
the
minute
she
slaps
her
eyes
on
naisi
says
she
the
grandest
man
in
the
width
of
the
world
and
i
be
wife
to
no
man
but
him
says
she
so
she
calls
in
the
sons
of
usnach
though
the
old
woman
is
scared
to
have
her
and
she
tells
naisi
she
going
to
marry
him
and
naisi
says
says
he
never
be
one
to
refuse
a
lady
but
there
be
murder
the
day
conchubar
finds
it
out
says
he
so
they
went
away
that
same
night
and
the
old
woman
fair
distraught
with
fear
soon
along
comes
conchubar
to
see
deirdre
for
to
marry
her
and
he
had
many
men
with
him
when
he
finds
deirdre
gone
that
naisi
says
he
stole
her
away
and
he
cursed
him
and
all
his
men
and
himself
went
out
for
to
chase
naisi
and
his
two
brothers
but
they
never
caught
up
with
them
at
all
for
ten
years
and
naisi
and
deirdre
living
all
the
time
as
happy
as
two
birds
in
the
springtime
no
fighting
at
all
yet
said
dennis
and
ten
years
gone
by
musha
indeed
is
not
much
of
a
tale
at
all
there
was
fighting
enough
when
the
years
were
up
eileen
said
the
men
of
conchubar
pursued
them
up
hill
and
down
dale
and
when
they
finally
caught
them
there
was
fighting
that
made
the
ground
red
with
the
blood
spilled
and
when
naisi
and
his
brothers
were
all
caught
together
and
conchubar
was
after
killing
them
sure
did
deirdre
put
an
end
to
herself
entirely
and
the
four
of
them
were
buried
together
in
one
grave
but
however
will
we
play
it
at
all
said
larry
listen
now
said
eileen
i
be
deirdre
of
course
you
can
just
be
naisi
larry
and
dennis
can
be
conchubar
and
he
after
us
and
we
running
as
fast
as
ever
we
can
to
get
away
from
him
you
must
give
us
a
start
dennis
chapter
eight
diddy
larry
and
eileen
took
hold
of
hands
and
began
running
as
fast
as
they
could
they
jumped
from
one
tuft
of
grass
to
another
dennis
came
splashing
through
the
puddles
after
them
he
had
almost
caught
them
when
all
of
a
sudden
larry
stopped
and
listened
what
that
now
he
said
eileen
and
dennis
listened
too
they
heard
a
faint
squealing
sound
they
looked
all
around
there
was
nothing
in
sight
but
the
brown
bog
and
the
stones
and
the
blue
hills
far
beyond
they
were
a
little
bit
scared
do
you
suppose
it
might
be
a
leprechaun
eileen
whispered
is
a
tapping
noise
they
make
not
a
crying
noise
at
all
larry
answered
maybe
it
a
banshee
dennis
said
they
do
be
crying
about
sometimes
before
somebody
is
going
to
die
is
no
banshee
whatever
eileen
declared
they
only
cry
at
night
they
heard
the
squealing
sound
again
is
right
over
there
cried
eileen
pointing
to
a
black
hole
in
the
bog
where
turf
had
been
cut
out
indeed
and
it
might
be
a
beautiful
baby
like
deirdre
herself
let
go
and
see
they
crept
up
to
the
and
peeped
over
the
edge
the
hole
was
quite
deep
and
down
in
the
bottom
of
it
was
a
little
pig
dennis
rolled
over
on
the
ground
beside
the
and
screamed
with
laughter
sure
is
the
beautiful
child
entirely
he
said
is
the
little
pig
the
tinkers
had
cried
eileen
it
broke
the
rope
and
ran
away
with
itself
shouted
larry
however
will
we
get
it
out
said
eileen
the
hole
is
too
deep
entirely
the
poor
little
thing
is
nearly
destroyed
with
hunger
larry
said
i
go
down
in
the
hole
and
lift
her
out
however
will
you
get
out
yourself
then
larry
darling
cried
eileen
the
two
of
you
can
give
me
your
hands
said
larry
and
i
be
up
in
no
time
then
larry
jumped
down
into
the
hole
he
caught
the
little
pig
in
his
arms
the
little
pig
squealed
harder
than
ever
and
tried
to
get
away
but
larry
held
it
up
as
high
as
he
could
eileen
and
dennis
reached
down
and
each
got
hold
of
one
of
the
front
feet
now
then
for
you
cried
larry
he
gave
the
pig
a
great
shove
he
shoved
so
hard
that
eileen
and
dennis
both
fell
over
backwards
into
a
puddle
but
they
held
tight
to
the
pig
and
there
the
three
of
them
were
together
rolling
in
the
bog
with
the
pig
on
top
of
them
hold
her
hold
her
shrieked
larry
by
standing
on
tiptoe
his
nose
was
just
above
the
edge
of
the
so
he
could
see
them
i
got
her
eileen
cried
run
back
for
the
bit
of
rope
the
tinkers
left
dennis
and
tie
her
hard
and
fast
dennis
ran
for
the
rope
while
eileen
sat
on
the
ground
and
held
the
little
pig
in
her
arms
the
little
pig
squealed
and
kicked
and
tried
every
minute
to
get
away
she
kicked
even
after
her
hind
legs
were
tied
together
but
eileen
held
on
you
have
to
get
larry
out
alone
dennis
while
i
never
let
go
of
this
pig
cried
eileen
breathlessly
she
that
wild
she
be
running
away
with
herself
on
her
two
front
legs
alone
dennis
reached
down
and
took
both
of
larry
hands
and
pulled
and
pulled
until
he
got
him
out
larry
was
covered
with
mud
from
the
and
eileen
and
dennis
were
wet
and
muddy
from
falling
into
the
puddle
but
they
had
the
pig
sure
she
is
a
beautiful
little
pig
and
we
call
her
deirdre
because
we
found
her
in
the
bog
just
in
the
same
way
as
conchubar
himself
said
larry
indeed
deirdre
was
too
beautiful
altogether
to
be
naming
a
pig
after
her
eileen
said
is
she
a
beautiful
little
pig
then
larry
answered
well
maybe
we
might
be
calling
her
for
short
and
no
offence
to
herself
at
all
eileen
agreed
the
poor
little
pig
was
so
tired
out
with
struggling
and
so
hungry
that
she
was
fairly
quiet
while
dennis
carried
her
on
his
shoulder
to
the
road
eileen
walked
behind
dennis
and
fed
her
with
green
leaves
she
was
so
quiet
that
larry
said
we
tie
the
rope
to
one
of
hind
legs
and
she
run
home
herself
in
front
of
us
so
when
they
reached
the
road
he
and
dennis
tied
the
rope
securely
to
diddy
left
hind
leg
and
set
her
down
they
found
colleen
asleep
standing
up
larry
woke
her
then
he
said
eileen
come
now
you
take
the
jug
and
get
on
colleen
back
dennis
can
lead
her
and
i
drive
the
pig
myself
but
diddy
was
feeling
better
after
her
rest
she
made
up
her
mind
she
did
like
the
plan
she
squealed
and
tried
to
get
away
once
she
turned
quickly
and
ran
between
larry
legs
and
tripped
him
up
but
she
was
a
tired
little
pig
and
so
it
was
not
long
before
somehow
they
got
her
back
to
where
mr
mcqueen
was
working
he
had
heard
them
coming
though
what
with
the
pig
squealing
and
the
children
all
speaking
at
once
they
made
noise
enough
but
mr
mcqueen
had
his
head
down
digging
and
he
was
in
a
besides
so
when
they
came
up
right
beside
him
with
the
pig
he
almost
fell
over
with
astonishment
he
stopped
his
work
and
leaned
on
his
clete
while
they
told
him
all
about
the
pig
and
how
they
found
it
and
got
it
out
of
the
hole
and
how
the
tinkers
must
have
lost
it
and
when
they
were
all
done
he
only
said
the
saints
preserve
us
we
take
it
home
to
herself
and
let
her
cosset
it
up
a
bit
so
the
children
hurried
off
to
take
the
pig
to
their
mother
without
even
stopping
to
eat
their
bit
of
lunch
mr
mcqueen
came
too
when
they
got
home
they
found
mrs
mcqueen
leaning
on
the
farmyard
fence
when
she
saw
them
coming
with
the
pig
she
ran
out
to
meet
them
wherever
did
you
find
the
fine
little
pig
she
cried
then
she
threw
up
her
hands
look
at
the
mud
on
you
she
said
then
the
twins
and
dennis
told
the
story
all
over
again
and
mrs
mcqueen
took
the
little
pig
in
her
apron
the
poor
little
thing
she
said
its
heart
is
beating
that
hard
you
think
its
ribs
would
burst
themselves
i
get
it
some
milk
right
away
this
minute
when
once
you
looked
in
the
yard
mr
mcqueen
and
dennis
and
the
twins
went
to
the
fence
there
in
the
yard
were
the
two
geese
with
the
black
feathers
in
their
wings
faith
and
the
luck
is
all
with
us
this
day
said
mr
mcqueen
however
did
you
get
them
back
at
all
was
this
way
if
you
believe
me
said
mrs
mcqueen
she
scratched
the
little
pig
back
with
one
hand
as
she
talked
i
was
just
after
churning
my
butter
when
what
should
i
see
looking
in
the
door
but
that
thief
of
a
tinker
with
the
beard
like
a
rick
of
hay
thinks
i
to
myself
sure
my
butter
will
be
bewitched
and
never
come
at
all
with
the
bad
luck
of
a
stranger
and
he
a
tinker
coming
in
the
house
but
he
comes
in
and
gives
one
plunge
to
the
dasher
for
luck
and
to
break
the
spell
and
says
he
very
civil
you
be
wanting
to
buy
any
fine
geese
my
heart
was
going
but
i
says
to
him
might
look
at
them
maybe
and
with
that
i
go
to
the
door
for
the
sake
of
getting
him
out
of
it
and
if
there
were
our
own
two
geese
with
the
legs
of
them
tied
together
the
impudence
of
that
cried
mr
mcqueen
get
along
with
your
tale
woman
surely
you
never
paid
the
old
thief
for
your
own
two
geese
trust
me
replied
mrs
mcqueen
i
coming
around
to
the
point
of
my
tale
gradual
like
an
old
goat
grazing
around
its
tethering
stump
i
says
to
him
look
well
enough
but
i
wishful
to
see
them
standing
up
on
their
own
two
legs
that
one
looks
as
if
it
might
be
a
bit
lame
and
the
cord
so
tight
on
it
and
meanwhile
will
you
be
having
a
bit
of
a
drink
on
this
hot
day
then
i
gave
him
a
sup
of
milk
in
a
mug
and
with
that
he
thanks
me
kindly
loosens
the
cord
and
sets
the
geese
up
on
their
legs
for
me
to
see
in
a
minute
of
time
i
stood
between
him
and
the
geese
and
says
i
to
them
and
to
him
i
says
along
with
you
before
i
call
the
man
working
behind
the
house
to
put
an
end
to
your
thieving
entirely
and
upon
that
he
went
in
great
haste
taking
the
mug
along
with
him
but
it
was
cracked
anyway
woman
woman
but
you
the
clever
tongue
in
your
head
said
mr
mcqueen
with
admiration
is
mighty
lucky
we
have
said
mrs
mcqueen
for
it
little
else
women
have
in
this
world
to
help
themselves
with
then
she
put
the
little
pig
down
in
the
empty
in
the
farmyard
and
went
to
fetch
it
some
milk
chapter
nine
the
secret
mr
mcqueen
was
a
good
farmer
but
at
the
time
he
lived
in
ireland
farmers
could
not
own
their
farms
the
land
was
all
owned
by
rich
landlords
who
did
not
do
any
work
themselves
these
landlords
very
often
lived
away
in
england
or
france
and
did
not
know
much
about
how
the
poor
people
lived
at
home
or
how
hard
they
had
to
work
to
get
the
money
for
the
rent
of
their
farms
sometimes
when
they
did
know
they
did
care
what
they
wanted
was
all
the
money
they
could
get
so
they
could
live
in
fine
houses
and
wear
beautiful
clothes
and
go
where
they
pleased
without
doing
any
work
when
the
landlords
were
away
they
had
agents
to
collect
the
rents
for
them
the
business
of
these
agents
was
to
get
all
the
rent
money
they
could
and
they
made
life
very
hard
for
the
farmers
sometimes
when
the
farmers
could
pay
all
the
rent
the
agent
would
turn
them
out
of
their
houses
this
was
called
evicting
them
the
farm
that
mr
mcqueen
lived
on
as
well
as
the
village
and
all
the
country
roundabout
was
owned
by
the
earl
of
elsmore
who
lived
most
of
the
year
in
great
style
in
england
the
agent
who
collected
rents
was
mr
conroy
nobody
liked
mr
conroy
very
much
but
everybody
was
afraid
of
him
because
he
could
do
so
much
to
injure
them
so
one
morning
when
mr
mcqueen
came
back
very
early
from
his
he
was
not
glad
to
see
mr
conroy
horse
standing
near
his
door
and
mr
conroy
himself
leaning
on
the
farmyard
fence
looking
at
the
fowls
how
are
you
mcqueen
said
mr
conroy
when
mr
mcqueen
came
up
well
enough
mr
conroy
said
mr
mcqueen
and
you
doing
well
with
the
farm
too
it
seems
said
mr
conroy
those
are
fowls
you
have
and
the
pig
is
fine
and
fat
how
many
cows
have
you
now
two
and
a
heifer
said
mr
mcqueen
you
drained
that
field
over
by
the
bog
this
year
did
you
and
have
it
planted
to
turnips
went
on
mr
conroy
i
glad
to
see
you
so
prosperous
mcqueen
of
course
now
the
farm
is
worth
more
than
it
was
when
you
first
took
it
and
so
you
not
be
surprised
that
i
raising
the
rent
on
you
if
the
farm
is
worth
more
is
my
work
that
has
made
it
so
said
mr
mcqueen
and
i
should
be
punished
for
that
the
house
is
none
too
good
at
all
and
the
place
is
not
worth
more
last
year
was
the
drought
and
all
manner
of
bad
luck
and
next
year
may
be
no
better
truly
mr
conroy
if
you
press
me
i
do
know
how
i
can
scrape
more
together
than
i
paying
now
well
then
said
mr
conroy
you
must
just
find
a
way
for
this
is
one
of
the
best
farms
about
here
and
you
should
pay
as
much
as
any
one
you
ca
get
money
by
shaking
a
man
with
empty
pockets
said
mr
mcqueen
but
mr
conroy
only
laughed
and
said
you
have
five
pounds
in
yours
when
next
comes
around
or
be
the
worse
for
you
you
would
like
to
be
evicted
sure
then
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
mr
mcqueen
went
into
the
house
with
a
heavy
heart
and
told
his
wife
the
bad
news
faith
said
mrs
mcqueen
i
not
be
in
that
man
shoes
for
all
you
could
offer
it
grinding
down
the
faces
of
the
poor
he
is
and
that
at
the
telling
of
some
one
else
not
even
his
badness
is
his
own
he
does
as
he
bid
he
gets
fat
on
it
said
mr
mcqueen
faith
we
get
along
somehow
said
mrs
mcqueen
we
always
have
though
is
true
it
been
scant
fare
we
had
now
and
again
mr
mcqueen
did
answer
he
went
back
to
his
work
in
the
fields
mrs
mcqueen
got
the
twins
started
off
to
school
with
their
lunch
in
a
little
tin
bucket
and
began
her
washing
but
she
did
not
sing
at
her
work
that
day
as
she
sometimes
did
larry
and
eileen
knew
that
something
was
wrong
though
their
father
and
mother
had
not
said
anything
to
them
about
it
they
had
seen
mr
conroy
talking
with
their
father
in
the
yard
and
it
never
a
sign
of
anything
good
to
see
mr
conroy
eileen
said
larry
was
thinking
the
same
thing
for
he
said
when
i
a
man
i
going
to
be
rich
and
then
i
give
you
and
mother
and
dada
a
fine
house
and
fine
clothes
and
things
in
plenty
however
will
you
get
the
money
asked
eileen
oh
giants
or
something
larry
answered
or
maybe
being
an
alderman
blathers
said
eileen
i
a
better
plan
in
my
head
you
know
dada
and
mother
said
we
could
have
diddy
for
our
very
own
because
we
found
her
ourselves
i
do
said
larry
well
then
said
eileen
i
know
it
about
the
rent
they
are
bothered
for
it
always
is
the
rent
that
bothers
them
now
when
the
comes
we
coax
dada
to
let
us
take
diddy
to
the
fair
she
be
nice
and
fat
by
that
time
and
we
sell
her
and
give
the
money
to
dada
for
the
rent
sure
it
will
be
hard
parting
with
diddy
that
been
like
one
of
our
own
family
since
the
day
we
found
her
crying
in
the
bog
said
larry
indeed
and
it
will
said
eileen
but
we
think
more
of
our
parents
than
of
a
pig
surely
but
however
will
we
get
her
to
the
fair
to
sell
her
said
larry
we
get
dada
to
take
her
for
us
but
we
never
tell
him
we
mean
the
money
to
go
for
the
rent
until
we
put
it
in
his
hands
eileen
answered
and
we
wo
tell
any
one
else
at
all
it
a
secret
i
like
to
be
telling
dennis
maybe
said
larry
we
can
tell
dennis
and
grannie
malone
but
no
one
else
at
all
eileen
agreed
chapter
ten
school
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
schoolhouse
the
schoolmaster
was
standing
in
the
door
calling
the
children
to
come
in
he
was
a
tall
man
dressed
in
a
worn
suit
of
black
he
wore
glasses
on
his
nose
and
carried
a
stick
in
his
hand
the
schoolhouse
had
only
one
room
with
four
small
windows
and
larry
hung
his
cap
and
eileen
her
shawl
on
nails
driven
into
the
wall
the
schoolroom
had
benches
for
the
children
to
sit
on
with
long
desks
in
front
of
them
on
the
wall
hung
a
printed
copy
of
the
ten
commandments
at
one
side
there
was
a
fireplace
but
as
it
was
summer
there
was
no
fire
in
it
the
master
rapped
on
his
desk
which
was
in
the
front
of
the
room
and
the
children
all
hurried
to
their
seats
larry
sat
on
one
side
of
the
room
with
the
boys
eileen
sat
on
the
other
with
the
girls
the
master
called
the
roll
there
were
fifteen
boys
and
thirteen
girls
when
the
roll
was
called
and
the
number
marked
down
on
a
slate
in
front
of
the
school
the
master
said
first
class
in
reading
all
the
little
boys
and
girls
of
the
size
of
larry
and
eileen
came
forward
and
stood
in
a
row
there
were
just
three
of
them
larry
and
eileen
and
dennis
larry
you
may
begin
said
the
master
larry
read
the
first
lines
of
the
lesson
they
were
to
do
ill
is
a
sin
can
you
run
far
larry
wondered
who
it
was
that
had
done
ill
and
if
he
were
running
away
because
of
it
and
who
stopped
him
to
ask
can
you
run
far
he
was
thinking
about
it
when
eileen
read
the
next
two
sentences
they
were
is
he
friend
or
foe
did
you
hurt
your
toe
this
did
not
seem
to
larry
to
clear
the
mystery
next
called
the
master
dennis
stood
next
he
read
he
was
born
in
a
house
on
the
hill
is
rice
a
kind
of
corn
get
me
a
cork
for
the
ink
jar
just
at
this
point
the
master
went
to
the
open
door
to
drive
away
some
chickens
that
wanted
to
come
in
and
as
dennis
had
not
been
told
to
stop
he
went
right
on
dennis
was
eight
and
he
could
read
quite
fast
if
he
kept
his
finger
on
the
place
this
is
what
he
read
the
morn
is
the
first
part
of
the
day
this
is
my
son
i
hope
you
will
like
him
sin
not
for
god
hates
sin
can
a
worm
walk
no
it
has
no
feet
but
it
can
creep
did
you
meet
fred
in
the
street
weep
no
more
by
this
time
the
chickens
were
frightened
away
and
dennis
was
nearly
out
of
breath
the
master
came
back
then
eileen
had
a
turn
they
could
almost
say
the
lessons
by
heart
they
knew
them
so
well
after
the
they
went
back
to
their
benches
and
studied
in
loud
whispers
but
larry
was
thinking
of
something
else
he
drew
a
pig
with
a
curly
tail
on
his
slate
like
this
he
held
it
up
for
dennis
to
see
he
wanted
to
tell
him
about
diddy
and
the
fair
but
the
master
saw
what
he
had
done
come
here
larry
mcqueen
and
bring
your
slate
he
said
sure
i
teach
you
better
manners
get
up
on
this
stool
now
and
show
yourself
he
put
a
large
paper
on
larry
head
and
made
him
sit
up
on
a
stool
before
the
whole
school
the
other
children
laughed
all
but
eileen
she
hid
her
face
on
her
desk
and
two
little
tears
squeezed
out
between
her
fingers
but
larry
did
cry
he
pretended
he
did
care
at
all
he
sat
there
for
what
seemed
a
very
long
time
while
other
children
recited
other
lessons
in
reading
and
grammar
and
arithmetic
the
master
gave
him
this
poem
to
learn
by
heart
i
thank
the
goodness
and
the
grace
that
on
my
birth
have
smiled
and
made
me
in
these
christian
days
a
happy
english
child
larry
wondered
why
he
was
called
an
english
child
when
he
knew
he
was
irish
and
he
was
so
sure
either
about
the
christian
days
but
he
learned
it
and
said
it
to
the
teacher
before
he
got
down
off
the
stool
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
about
three
days
before
noontime
came
at
last
they
were
dismissed
and
the
twins
went
out
with
the
other
children
into
the
schoolyard
to
eat
their
luncheon
dennis
ate
his
with
them
and
larry
told
him
the
secret
after
lunch
they
went
back
into
the
dark
smoky
little
schoolroom
for
more
lessons
and
when
three
came
how
glad
they
were
to
go
dancing
out
into
the
sunshine
again
and
walk
home
along
the
familiar
road
with
the
air
sweet
about
them
and
the
little
birds
singing
in
the
fields
chapter
eleven
the
fair
for
many
weeks
eileen
and
larry
kept
the
secret
they
told
no
one
but
dennis
and
grannie
malone
and
they
both
promised
they
would
never
never
tell
mr
mcqueen
worked
hard
early
and
late
over
his
turnips
and
cabbages
and
potatoes
and
larry
and
eileen
helped
by
feeding
the
pig
and
chickens
and
driving
the
cows
along
the
roadsides
where
they
could
get
fresh
sweet
grass
to
eat
one
evening
mr
mcqueen
said
to
his
wife
comes
soon
and
next
week
will
be
the
fair
larry
and
eileen
heard
him
say
it
they
looked
at
each
other
and
then
eileen
went
to
her
father
and
said
dada

take
larry
and
me
to
the
fair
with
you

eileen
answered
but

pig
and
we
want
to
sell
it
do
we
larry
larry
nodded
his
head
up
and
down
very
hard
with
his
mouth
tight
shut
he
was
so
afraid
the
secret
would
jump
out
of
it
well
i
never
heard
the
likes
of
that
said
mcqueen
he
slapped
his
knee
and
laughed
we
got
it
all
planned
said
eileen
she
was
almost
ready
to
cry
because
her
father
laughed
at
her
we
fed
the
pig
and
fed
her
until
she
so
fat
she
can
hardly
walk
and
we
are
going
to
wash
her
clean
and
i
have
a
ribbon
to
tie
on
her
ear
diddy
will
look
so
fine
and
stylish
i
sure
some
one
will
want
to
buy
her
mrs
mcqueen
was
just
setting
away
a
pan
of
milk
she
stopped
with
the
pan
in
her
hand
leave
them
go
she
said
mr
mcqueen
smoked
awhile
in
silence
at
last
he
said
it
your
own
pig
and
i
suppose
you
can
go
but
you
have
a
long
day
of
it
the
longer
the
better
said
the
twins
all
that
week
they
carried
acorns
and
and
everything
they
could
find
that
was
good
for
pigs
to
eat
and
fed
them
to
diddy
and
she
got
fatter
than
ever
the
day
before
the
fair
they
took
the
and
the
broom
and
some
water
and
scrubbed
her
until
she
was
all
pink
and
clean
then
they
put
her
in
a
clean
place
for
the
night
and
went
to
bed
early
so
they
would
be
ready
to
get
up
in
the
morning
when
the
first
cock
crowed
before
daylight
the
next
morning
eyes
popped
wide
open
in
the
dark
the
cock
crowed
again
wake
up
larry
darling
cried
eileen
from
her
bed
the
morn
is
upon
us
and
we
are
not
ready
for
the
fair
larry
bounded
out
of
bed
and
such
a
scurrying
around
as
there
was
to
get
ready
mrs
mcqueen
was
already
blowing
the
fire
on
the
hearth
in
the
kitchen
into
a
blaze
and
the
kettle
was
on
to
boil
the
twins
wet
their
hair
and
their
mother
parted
it
and
then
they
combed
it
down
tight
on
the
sides
of
their
heads
but
no
matter
how
much
they
wet
their
hair
the
wind
always
blew
it
about
their
ears
again
in
a
very
little
while
they
put
on
their
best
clothes
and
then
they
were
ready
for
breakfast
mr
mcqueen
was
up
long
before
the
twins
he
had
harnessed
colleen
and
had
loaded
the
pig
into
the
cart
somehow
and
tied
her
securely
this
must
have
been
hard
work
for
diddy
had
made
up
her
mind
she
going
to
the
fair
mr
mcqueen
had
found
room
too
for
some
crocks
of
butter
and
several
dozen
eggs
carefully
packed
in
straw
when
breakfast
was
over
mrs
mcqueen
brought
a
stick
with
notches
cut
in
it
and
gave
it
to
mr
mcqueen
she
explained
what
each
notch
meant
there
one
notch
and
a
big
one
for
selling
the
pig
she
said
and
mind
you
see
that
the
twins
get
a
good
price
for
the
creature
and
here
another
for
selling
the
butter
and
eggs
and
this
is
a
pound
of
tea
for
grannie
malone
she
been
out
of
tea
this
week
past
and
she
with
no
one
to
send
and
this
notch
is
for
mrs
maguire
side
of
bacon
that
you
to
be
after
bringing
her
with
her
egg
money
which
is
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
paper
in
your
inside
pocket
and
by
the
same
token
do
you
be
losing
it
and
for
myself
there
so
many
things
i
needing
that
i
put
all
these
small
notches
close
together
there
yarn
for
stockings
for
the
twins
and
some
thread
for
myself
to
make
crochet
that
might
turn
me
a
penny
in
my
odd
moments
and
a
bit
of
flour
and
some
yellow
meal
now
remember
that
you
forget
nothing
of
it
all
mr
mcqueen
shook
his
head
sadly
faith
there
little
pleasure
in
going
to
the
fair
with
so
many
things
on
my
mind
he
said
the
sun
was
just
peeping
over
the
distant
hills
when
colleen
started
up
the
road
pulling
the
cart
with
diddy
in
it
squealing
like
a
dozen
of
herself
mrs
mcqueen
said
mr
mcqueen
led
the
donkey
and
larry
and
eileen
followed
on
foot
they
had
on
shoes
and
stockings
and
eileen
had
on
a
clean
apron
and
a
bright
little
shawl
so
they
looked
quite
gay
they
walked
miles
and
miles
beside
bogs
and
over
hills
along
country
roads
bordered
by
hedgerows
or
by
stone
walls
at
last
they
saw
the
towers
of
the
castle
which
belonged
to
the
earl
of
elsmore
it
was
on
top
of
a
high
hill
the
towers
stood
up
strong
and
proud
against
the
sky
smoke
was
coming
out
of
the
chimneys
do
you
suppose
the
earl
himself
is
at
home
eileen
asked
her
father
is
not
unlikely
mr
mcqueen
answered
he
comes
home
sometimes
with
parties
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
for
a
bit
of
shooting
or
fishing
maybe
he
come
to
the
fair
eileen
said
to
larry
sure
he
never
miss
anything
so
grand
as
the
fair
and
he
being
in
this
part
of
the
world
said
larry
some
distance
from
the
castle
they
could
see
a
church
spire
and
the
roofs
of
the
town
and
nearer
they
saw
a
little
village
of
stalls
standing
in
the
green
field
like
mushrooms
that
had
sprung
up
overnight
the
fair
the
fair
cried
the
twins
chapter
twelve
how
they
sold
the
pig
although
they
had
come
so
far
they
were
among
the
earliest
at
the
fair
people
were
hurrying
to
and
fro
carrying
all
sorts
of
goods
and
arranging
them
for
sale
on
counters
in
little
stalls
around
an
open
square
in
the
centre
of
the
grounds
cattle
were
being
driven
to
their
pens
horses
were
being
brushed
and
curried
sheep
were
bleating
cows
were
lowing
and
even
the
hens
and
ducks
added
their
noise
to
the
concert
diddy
herself
squealed
with
all
her
might
larry
and
eileen
had
never
seen
so
many
people
together
before
in
all
their
lives
they
had
to
think
very
hard
about
the
secret
in
order
not
to
forget
everything
but
the
beautiful
things
they
saw
in
the
different
stalls
there
were
vegetables
and
meats
and
butter
and
eggs
there
were
hats
and
caps
there
were
and
and
shawls
with
bright
borders
spread
out
for
people
to
see
there
were
hawkers
going
about
with
trays
of
things
to
eat
pies
and
sweets
toffee
and
this
made
the
twins
remember
that
they
were
dreadfully
hungry
after
their
long
walk
but
they
did
have
anything
to
eat
until
quite
a
while
after
that
because
they
had
so
much
else
to
do
they
followed
their
father
to
the
corner
where
the
pigs
were
a
man
came
to
tell
them
where
to
put
diddy
you
can
talk
with
these
two
farmers
said
mr
mcqueen
he
brought
the
twins
forward
it
their
pig
then
larry
and
eileen
told
the
man
about
finding
diddy
in
the
bog
and
that
their
father
had
said
they
could
have
her
for
their
own
and
so
they
had
come
to
the
fair
to
sell
her
and
whatever
will
you
do
with
all
the
money
asked
the
man
the
twins
told
the
secret
was
right
on
the
tip
end
of
their
tongues
but
they
clapped
their
hands
over
their
mouths
quickly
so
it
did
get
out
the
man
laughed
anyway
it
a
fine
pig
and
you
a
right
to
get
a
good
price
for
her
he
said
and
he
gave
them
the
very
best
pen
of
all
for
diddy
when
she
was
safely
in
the
pen
eileen
and
larry
tied
the
red
ribbon
which
eileen
had
brought
in
her
pocket
to
diddy
ear
and
another
to
her
tail
diddy
looked
very
gay
when
the
twins
had
had
a
bite
to
eat
they
stood
up
before
diddy
pen
where
the
man
told
them
to
and
diddy
stood
up
on
her
hind
legs
with
her
front
feet
on
the
rail
and
squealed
larry
and
eileen
fed
her
with
there
were
a
great
many
people
in
the
fairgrounds
by
that
time
they
were
laughing
and
talking
and
looking
at
the
things
in
the
different
booths
every
single
one
of
them
stopped
to
look
at
diddy
and
the
twins
because
the
twins
were
the
very
youngest
farmers
in
the
whole
fair
everybody
was
interested
but
nobody
offered
to
buy
and
the
twins
were
getting
discouraged
when
along
came
some
farmers
with
ribbons
in
their
hands
they
were
the
judges
the
twins
almost
held
their
breath
while
the
judges
looked
diddy
over
then
the
head
man
said
that
a
very
fine
pig
and
young
she
is
a
thoroughbred
wherever
did
you
get
her
mr
mcqueen
mr
mcqueen
just
said
ask
them
pointing
to
the
twins
the
twins
were
very
much
scared
to
be
talking
to
the
judges
but
they
told
about
the
tinkers
and
how
they
found
diddy
in
the
bog
and
the
judges
nodded
their
heads
and
looked
very
wise
and
finally
the
chief
one
said
faith
there
not
her
equal
in
the
whole
fair
she
gets
the
blue
ribbon
or
i
no
judge
all
the
other
men
said
the
same
then
they
gave
the
blue
ribbon
to
the
twins
and
eileen
tied
it
on
diddy
other
ear
diddy
did
not
seem
to
like
being
dressed
up
she
wiggled
her
ears
and
squealed
just
then
there
was
the
gay
sound
of
a
horn
tara
it
sang
and
right
into
the
middle
of
the
fairground
drove
a
great
coach
with
pretty
young
ladies
and
fine
young
gentlemen
riding
on
top
of
it
everybody
turned
away
from
diddy
and
the
twins
to
see
this
grand
sight
the
footman
jumped
down
and
helped
down
the
ladies
while
the
driver
in
livery
stood
beside
the
horses
heads
with
his
hand
on
their
bridles
then
all
the
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
went
about
the
fair
to
see
the
sights
is
a
grand
party
from
the
castle
said
mr
mcqueen
to
the
twins
and
sure
that
the
earl
daughter
the
lady
kathleen
herself
with
the
pink
roses
on
her
hat
i
have
seen
a
sight
of
her
since
she
was
a
slip
of
a
girl
the
size
of
yourselves
lady
kathleen
and
her
party
came
by
just
at
that
moment
and
when
she
saw
diddy
with
her
ribbons
and
the
twins
beside
her
the
lady
kathleen
stopped
the
twins
could
hardly
take
their
eyes
off
her
sweet
face
and
her
pretty
dress
and
the
flowered
hat
but
she
asked
them
all
sorts
of
questions
and
finally
they
found
themselves
telling
her
the
story
of
how
they
found
the
pig
and
what
is
your
pig
name
said
lady
kathleen
sure
it
deirdre
but
we
call
her
diddy
for
short
eileen
answered
all
the
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
laughed
the
twins
did
like
to
be
laughed
at
they
were
almost
ready
to
cry
and
why
did
you
call
her
deirdre
asked
lady
kathleen
it
was
because
of
finding
her
in
the
bog
all
alone
with
herself
the
same
as
deirdre
when
she
was
a
baby
and
found
by
the
high
king
of
emain
eileen
explained
a
very
good
reason
and
it
the
finest
story
in
ireland
said
lady
kathleen
i
glad
you
know
it
so
well
and
she
is
such
a
fine
pig
that
i
going
to
buy
her
from
you
myself
all
the
young
ladies
seemed
to
think
this
very
funny
indeed
but
lady
kathleen
did
laugh
she
called
one
of
the
footmen
he
came
running
do
you
see
that
this
pig
is
sent
to
the
castle
when
the
fair
is
over
she
said
i
will
your
ladyship
said
the
footman
then
lady
kathleen
took
out
her
purse
what
is
the
price
of
your
pig
she
said
to
the
twins
they
did
know
what
to
say
but
the
judge
who
was
standing
near
said
she
is
a
pig
your
ladyship
and
worth
all
of
three
pounds
three
pounds
it
is
then
said
the
lady
kathleen
she
opened
her
purse
and
took
out
three
golden
sovereigns
she
gave
them
to
the
twins
and
then
almost
before
they
found
breath
to
say
thank
you
she
and
her
gay
company
had
gone
on
to
another
part
of
the
fair
the
judge
made
a
mark
on
diddy
back
to
show
that
she
had
been
sold
the
twins
gave
the
three
golden
sovereigns
to
their
father
to
carry
for
them
and
he
put
them
in
the
most
inside
pocket
he
had
for
safe
keeping
then
while
he
stayed
to
sell
his
butter
and
eggs
and
to
do
his
buying
the
twins
started
out
to
see
the
fair
by
themselves
chapter
thirteen
what
they
saw
the
first
person
they
stopped
to
watch
was
a
juggler
doing
tricks
it
was
quite
wonderful
to
see
him
keep
three
balls
in
the
air
all
at
the
same
time
or
balance
a
pole
on
the
end
of
his
nose
but
when
he
took
out
a
from
behind
his
stall
and
said
to
the
twins
who
were
standing
right
in
front
of
him
now
i
be
after
making
you
a
bit
of
an
omelet
without
any
cooking
their
eyes
were
fairly
popping
out
of
their
heads
with
surprise
the
juggler
broke
an
egg
into
the
then
he
clapped
on
the
cover
waved
the
pan
in
the
air
and
lifted
the
cover
again
instead
of
an
omelet
there
in
the
was
a
little
black
chicken
crying
peep
peep
as
if
it
wanted
its
mother
the
juggler
looked
very
much
surprised
himself
and
the
twins
were
simply
astonished
will
you
see
that
now
larry
whispered
to
eileen
sure
if
only
old
speckle
could
be
learning
that
trick
save
her
a
deal
of
sitting
indeed
then
is
magic
eileen
answered
back
and
there
no
luck
in
that
same
do
you
come
away
now
larry
mcqueen
or
he
might
be
casting
his
spells
on
yourself
and
turning
you
into
something
else
entirely
a
goat
maybe
or
a
leprechaun
this
seemed
quite
likely
to
larry
too
so
they
slipped
hurriedly
out
under
the
elbows
of
the
crowd
just
as
the
juggler
was
in
the
very
act
of
finding
a
white
rabbit
in
the
crown
of
his
hat
they
never
stopped
running
until
they
found
themselves
in
the
middle
of
a
group
of
people
in
a
distant
part
of
the
fairgrounds
this
crowd
had
gathered
around
a
man
with
a
bundle
of
papers
under
his
arm
he
was
waving
a
leaflet
in
the
air
and
shouting
ladies
and
gentlemen
whist
now
till
i
sing
you
a
song
of
old
ireland
is
the
ballad
of
the
census
taker
then
he
began
to
sing
in
a
voice
as
loud
as
a
clap
of
thunder
this
was
the
first
verse
of
the
song
they
taking
of
the
census
in
the
country
and
the
town
your
children
got
the
measles
your
chimneys
tumbling
down
every
one
seemed
to
think
this
a
very
funny
song
and
at
the
end
of
the
second
verse
they
all
joined
in
the
chorus
the
ballad
singer
sang
louder
than
all
the
rest
of
the
people
put
together
musha
the
roars
of
him
are
like
the
roars
of
a
giant
eileen
said
to
larry
indeed
i
fearing
he
burst
himself
with
the
noise
in
him
the
moment
the
song
ended
the
ballad
singer
passed
the
hat
and
the
crowd
began
to
melt
away
there
you
go
now
cried
the
singer
lepping
away
on
your
two
hind
legs
like
scared
rabbits
come
along
back
now
and
buy
the
ballad
of
peeler
and
the
goat
sure
is
a
fine
song
entirely
and
one
you
all
be
wanting
to
sing
yourselves
when
once
you
heard
it
he
seized
a
young
man
by
the
arm
walk
up
and
buy
a
ballad
now
he
said
to
him
troth

the
look
of
a
fine
singer

what
minute
you
may
be
needing
one
and

handy

too
late

young
man
turned
very
red

think

be
wanting
any
ballads
he
said
and
tried
to
pull
away
you
do
think
shouted
the
ballad
singer
of
course
you
think
you
nothing
whatever
to
do
it
with
the
crowd
laughed
the
poor
young
man
bought
a
ballad
there
now
cried
the
singer
you
the
broth
of
a
boy
after
all
who
be
after
buying
the
next
one
off
of
me
his
eyes
lighted
on
the
twins
they
shook
in
their
shoes
he
be
clapping
one
of
them
on
us
next
larry
said
to
eileen
we
best
be
going
along
and
they
crept
out
of
the
crowd
just
as
he
began
to
roar
out
a
new
song
an
old
woman
with
a
white
cap
and
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
a
basket
on
her
arm
smiled
at
them
as
they
slipped
by
she
jerked
her
thumb
over
her
shoulder
at
the
ballad
singer
melodious
is
the
closed
mouth
she
said
indeed
i
often
heard
my
mother
say
so
eileen
answered
politely
she
curtsied
to
the
old
woman
the
old
woman
looked
pleased
will
you
come
along
with
me
out
of
the
sound
of
this
the
both
of
you
she
said
and
i
take
you
to
hear
things
that
will
keep
the
memory
of
ireland
green
while
there
an
irishman
left
in
the
world
she
led
them
to
a
raised
platform
some
distance
away
over
the
platform
there
floated
a
white
flag
with
a
green
harp
on
it
the
old
woman
pointed
to
it
do
you
remember
the
old
harp
of
tara
she
said
to
the
twins
is
nowhere
else
at
all
now
but
on
the
flag
but
time
was
long
long
years
ago
when
the
harp
itself
was
played
on
tara
hill
and
in
those
days
there
were
poets
to
praise
ireland
and
singers
to
sing
her
songs
and
here
they
will
be
telling
of
those
days
and
singing
those
songs

is
a
feis
pronounced
they
having
and
prizes
given
for
the
best
tale
told
or
the
best
song
sung
the
old
woman
and
the
twins
made
their
way
to
the
platform
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
near
the
edge
of
it
many
other
people
were
sitting
or
standing
about
an
old
man
stood
up
on
the
platform
he
told
the
story
of
cuchulain
pronounced
the
hound
of
culain
and
how
he
fought
all
the
greatest
warriors
of
the
world
on
the
day
he
first
took
arms
when
he
had
finished
another
man
took
his
place
and
told
the
story
of
deirdre
and
naisi
and
another
told
the
fate
of
the
four
children
of
lir
that
were
turned
into
four
beautiful
swans
by
their
cruel
stepmother
and
when
the
stories
were
finished
a
prize
was
given
for
the
best
one
and
the
twins
were
glad
that
it
was
for
the
story
of
deirdre
for
that
tale
was
like
an
old
friend
to
them
after
that
there
was
music
and
the
dances
of
old
ireland
the
reel
and
the
lilt
and
when
last
of
all
came
the
irish
jig
the
old
woman
put
her
basket
down
on
the
ground
sure
the
music
is
like
the
springtime
in
my
bones
she
said
to
the
twins
i
the
foot
of
the
world
on
me
when
i
was
a
girl
and
i
can
still
shake
one
with
the
best
of
them
if
i
do
say
it
myself
she
put
her
hands
on
her
hips
and
began
to
dance
the
music
got
into
everybody
else
bones
too
and
soon
everybody
around
the
platform
and
on
it
too
old
and
young
large
and
small
was
dancing
gayly
to
the
sound
of
it
the
twins
danced
with
the
rest
and
they
were
having
such
a
good
time
that
they
might
have
forgotten
to
go
home
at
all
if
all
of
a
sudden
larry
had
shaken
eileen
arm
and
said
look
there
where
eileen

man
with
the
brown
horse
the
moment

ran
as
fast
as
they
could
back
to
their
father
we
saw
the
tinker
they
cried
the
moment
they
saw
mr

bought
a
ginger
cake

like
a
rabbit
and
another
like
a
man
from
one
of
the
hawkers
and
they
bought
some
too

i
bought

a
shawl
he
said
to
the
twins
the
twins
wanted
to
get
home
because
the
secret
was
getting
so
big
inside
of
them
they
knew
they
could
possibly
hold
it
in
much
longer
and
they
did
want
to
let
it
out
until
they
were
at
home
and
could
tell
their
father
and
mother
both
at
the
same
time
so
they
said
to
diddy
and
eileen
took
off
the
ribbons
and
kept
them
to
remember
her
by
then
they
hurried
away

was
after
dark
when
at
last
they
drove
into
the
yard
mrs
mcqueen
came
running
to
the
door
to
greet
them
and
hear
all
about
the
fair

and
larry
told
her
about

prize
and
about
lady
kathleen
buying
the
pig
and
about
seeing
the
tinker
while
their
father
was
putting
up
colleen
then
when
he
came
in
with
all
his
bundles
and
took
the
three
golden
sovereigns
out
of
his
pocket
to
show
to
the
mother

and
to
think
of
her
being
a
thoroughbred
like
that
and
we
never
knowing
it
at
all
she
meant
the
pig
but
mr
mcqueen
never
said
a
word
he
just
gave
larry
and
eileen
a
great
hug
then
mr
mcqueen
went
over
all
the
errands
with
his
wife
and
last
of
all
he
brought
out
the
shawl
there
old
woman
he
said
is
a
fairing
for
you
the
saints
be
praised
for
this
day
cried
mrs
mcqueen
the
rent
paid
and
me
with
a
fine
new
shawl
the
equal
of
any
in
the
parish
it
was
a
happy
family
that
went
to
bed
in
the
little
farmhouse
that
night
only
mrs
mcqueen
did
sleep
well
she
got
up
a
number
of
times
in
the
night
to
be
sure
there
were
no
tinkers
prowling
about
for
one
ca
be
too
careful
with
so
much
money
in
the
house
she
said
to
herself
chapter
fourteen
sunday
the
next
sunday
all
the
mcqueen
family
went
to
mass
and
mrs
mcqueen
wore
her
new
shawl
the
chapel
was
quite
a
distance
away
and
as
they
walked
and
all
the
neighbours
walked
too
they
had
a
pleasant
time
talking
together
along
the
way
dennis
and
the
twins
walked
together
and
larry
and
eileen
told
dennis
all
about
the
fair
and
about
selling
the
pig
to
the
lady
kathleen
and
begorra
said
dennis
but
that
little
pig
was
after
bringing
you
all
the
luck
in
the
world
was
she
all
the
other
boys
and
girls
wanted
to
hear
about
it
most
of
them
had
never
been
to
a
fair
so
eileen
and
larry
talked
all
the
way
to
church
and
that
was
two
miles
and
a
half
of
talk
the
shortest
way
you
could
go
just
as
they
neared
the
church
what
should
they
see
but
grannie
malone
coming
in
grandeur
riding
on
a
beside
her
was
a
big
man
with
a
tall
hat
on
his
head
is
her
son
michael
back
from
the
states
cried
the
twins
he
said
in
a
letter
he
was
coming
they
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
to
reach
the
church
door
in
time
to
see
them
go
in
everybody
else
stopped
too
they
were
so
surprised
and
everybody
said
to
everybody
else
well
for
dear
sake
if
that
not
michael
malone
come
back
to
see
his
old
mother
and
then
they
whispered
among
themselves
look
at
the
grand
clothes
on
him
and
the
scarf
pin
the
bigness
of
a
piece
and
the
hat
sure
america
must
be
the
rich
place
entirely
and
when
michael
got
out
of
the
cart
and
helped
out
his
old
mother
there
were
many
hands
held
out
for
him
to
shake
and
many
old
neighbours
for
him
to
greet
this
is
a
proud
day
for
you
grannie
malone
said
mrs
mcqueen
it
is
said
grannie
and
a
sad
day
too
for
he
after
taking
me
back
to
america
and
is
likely
i
never
set
my
two
eyes
on
old
ireland
again
when
once
the
width
of
the
sea
comes
between
us
she
wiped
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
then
the
bell
rang
to
call
the
people
into
the
chapel
it
was
little
the
congregation
heard
of
the
service
that
day
for
however
much
they
tried
they
could
help
looking
at
the
back
of
michael
head
and
at
grannie
bonnet
and
afterward
when
all
the
people
were
outside
the
church
door
grannie
malone
said
to
different
old
friends
of
michael
come
along
to
my
house
this
afternoon
and
listen
to
himself
telling
about
the
states
that
afternoon
when
the
mcqueens
had
finished
their
noon
meal
the
whole
family
walked
up
the
road
to
grannie
house
there
were
a
good
many
people
there
before
them
grannie
little
house
was
full
to
the
door
michael
stood
by
the
fireplace
and
as
the
mcqueens
came
in
he
was
saying
it
the
truth
i
telling
you
there
are
over
forty
states
in
the
union
and
many
of
them
bigger
than
the
whole
of
ireland
itself
there
are
places
in
it
where
you
could
travel
as
far
as
from
dublin
to
belfast
without
ever
seeing
a
town
at
all
just
fields
without
stones
or
trees
lying
there
begging
for
the
plough
and
sorrow
a
person
to
give
it
them
will
you
listen
to
that
now
said
grannie
and
more
than
that
if
you
believe
me
michael
went
on
there
do
be
places
in
america
where
they
land
let
alone
buying
it
just
by
going
and
living
on
it
for
a
time
and
doing
a
little
work
on
it
you
can
get
one
hundred
and
sixty
acres
of
land
for
your
own
mind
you
the
saints
preserve
us
but
that
might
be
like
heaven
itself
if
i
may
make
bold
to
say
so
said
mrs
maguire
you
may
well
say
that
mrs
maguire
michael
answered
for
there
when
a
man
has
bent
his
back
and
put
in
sweat
and
labour
to
enrich
the
land
it
is
not
for
some
one
else
he
does
it
but
for
himself
and
his
children
of
course
the
land
that
is
given
away
is
far
from
big
cities
and
it
queer
and
lonely
sometimes
on
the
distant
farms
for
they
do
not
live
in
villages
as
we
do
but
each
farmhouse
is
by
itself
on
its
own
land
and
no
neighbours
handy
so
for
myself
i
stayed
in
the
big
city
you
seem
to
have
prospered
michael
said
mr
mcqueen
i
have
so
michael
answered
there
are
jobs
in
plenty
for
the
willing
hands
sure
no
irishman
would
give
up
at
all
when
always
something
new
to
try
and
there
always
somebody
from
the
old
sod
there
to
help
you
if
the
luck
turns
on
you
do
you
remember
patrick
doran
now
he
lived
forninst
the
blacksmith
shop
years
ago
well
patrick
is
a
great
man
he
a
man
of
fortune
and
a
good
friend
to
myself
one
year
when
times
were
hard
and
work
not
so
plenty
i
lost
my
job
and
did
patrick
help
me
to
another
the
very
next
week
not
long
after
that
patrick
ran
for
alderman
and
myself
and
many
another
like
me
worked
hard
for
to
get
him
elected
and
since
then
i
been
in
politics
myself
first
patrick
got
me
a
job
on
the
police
force
and
then
i
was
captain
and
since
then
by
one
change
and
another
if
i
do
say
it
i
an
alderman
myself
it
wonderful
sure
mr
maguire
said
when
michael
had
finished
but
i
not
wishful
for
to
change
sure
old
ireland
is
good
enough
for
me
and
i
not
be
missing
the
larks
singing
in
the
spring
in
the
green
fields
of
erin
and
the
smell
of
the
peat
on
the
hearth
in
winter
it
queer
and
lonesome
i
be
without
these
things
and
that
the
truth
he
threw
his
head
back
and
began
to
sing
everybody
joined
in
and
sang
too
this
is
the
song
they
sang
old
ireland
you
my
jewel
sure
my
heart
delight
and
glory
till
time
shall
pass
his
empty
glass
your
name
shall
live
in
story
and
this
shall
be
the
song
for
me
the
first
my
heart
was
learning
when
first
my
tongue
its
accents
flung
old
ireland
you
my
darling
from
dublin
bay
to
cork
sweet
cove
old
ireland
you
my
darling
my
darling
my
darling
from
dublin
bay
to
cork
sweet
cove
old
ireland
you
my
darling
chapter
fifteen
mr
mcqueen
makes
up
his
mind
michael
sang
with
the
others
and
when
the
song
was
ended
he
said
is
a
true
word
mr
maguire
that
there
no
place
like
old
ireland
and
you
not
find
an
irishman
anywhere
in
america
that
would
put
the
man
down
that
said
a
word
against
her
but
what
with
the
landlords
taking
every
shilling
you
can
scrape
together
and
charging
you
higher
rent
whenever
you
make
a
bit
of
an
improvement
on
your
farm
there
no
chance
at
all
to
get
on
in
the
world
and
with
the
children
god
bless
them
coming
along
by
sixes
and
dozens
and
little
for
them
to
do
at
home
and
no
place
to
put
them
when
they
grow
up
sure
it
well
to
go
where
they
a
better
chance
look
at
the
schools
now
if
you
could
see
the
school
that
my
patrick
goes
to
you
never
rest
at
all
until
your
children
had
the
same
sure
the
schoolhouses
are
like
palaces
over
there
and
as
for
learning
the
children
pick
it
up
as
a
hen
does
corn
and
are
there
no
faults
with
america
whatever
mr
mcqueen
said
to
michael
there
do
be
faults
with
her
michael
answered
and
i
never
be
the
man
to
say
otherwise
there
plenty
of
things
to
be
said
about
america
that
would
leave
you
thinking
is
a
long
way
this
side
of
heaven
but
whatever
it
is
that
wrong
is
the
people
themselves
that
make
it
so
and
by
the
same
token
it
is
themselves
that
can
cure
the
trouble
when
they
so
minded
it
not
like
having
your
troubles
put
down
on
you
by
the
people
that
above
you
and
that
you
ca
reach
at
all
for
to
be
correcting
them
all
i
say
is
there
a
better
chance
over
there
for
yourself
and
the
children
the
twins
and
dennis
and
the
other
young
people
were
getting
tired
of
sitting
still
by
this
time
and
when
michael
stopped
talking
about
america
they
jumped
up
the
children
ran
outdoors
and
played
tag
around
grannie
house
and
the
older
people
stayed
inside
by
and
by
grannie
came
to
the
door
and
called
them
come
in
every
one
of
you
she
cried
and
have
a
fine
bit
of
cake
with
currants
in
it
sure
michael
brought
the
currants
and
all
the
things
for
to
make
it
yesterday
thinking
maybe
there
be
neighbours
in
and
maybe
is
the
last
bit
of
cake
i
be
making
for
you
at
all
for
is
but
two
weeks
now
until
we
start
across
the
water
she
wiped
her
eyes
on
her
apron
mr
mcqueen
was
very
quiet
as
he
walked
home
with
mrs
mcqueen
and
the
twins
and
that
evening
after
the
children
were
in
bed
he
sat
for
a
long
time
silent
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
his
pipe
went
out
and
he
did
not
notice
it
by
and
by
he
said
to
mrs
mcqueen
i
made
up
my
mind
the
lord
save
us
to
what
said
mrs
mcqueen
to
go
to
america
said
mr
mcqueen
mrs
mcqueen
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
rocked
back
and
forth
and
cried
to
be
leaving
the
place
i
was
born
and
where
my
father
and
mother
were
born
before
me
and
all
the
neighbours
and
this
old
house
that
been
home
since
ever
i
married
you
break
the
heart
in
my
body
she
said
i
like
that
part
of
it
no
better
than
yourself
said
mr
mcqueen
but
when
i
think
of
the
years
to
come
and
larry
and
eileen
growing
up
to
work
as
hard
as
we
have
worked
without
getting
much
at
all
and
think
of
the
better
chance
altogether
they
have
over
there
sure
i
ca
be
thinking
of
the
pain
but
only
of
the
hope
there
is
in
it
for
them
i
seen
this
coming
ever
since
the
children
told
us
about
grannie
malone
letter
said
mrs
mcqueen
is
michael
has
put
this
in
your
head
is
not
michael
alone
said
mr
mcqueen
is
also
other
things
i
pay
conroy
the
rent
money
and
it
will
take
all
that
the
pig
brought
and
all
i
been
able
to
rake
and
scrape
myself
and
nothing
left
over
at
all
and
there
but
ourselves
and
the
twins
and
the
year
has
not
been
a
bad
one
we
have
had
the
pig
which
we
be
having
another
year
and
what
would
it
be
like
if
there
were
more
of
us
to
feed
and
no
more
pigs
to
be
found
in
the
bog
like
manna
from
heaven
to
be
helping
us
out
sure
if
it
for
the
children
sobbed
mrs
mcqueen
i
go
anywhere
in
the
world
and
that
you
know
well
i
do
know
it
said
mr
mcqueen
and
since
we
going
at
all
let
it
be
soon
we
go
with
grannie
and
michael
in
two
weeks
time
cried
mrs
mcqueen
we
will
so
said
mr
mcqueen
i
no
debts
behind
me
and
we
can
sell
the
cows
and
hens
and
take
with
us
whatever
we
need
from
the
house
michael
malone
will
lend
me
the
money
and
find
me
a
job
when
we
get
there
the
likes
of
this
chance
will
never
befall
us
again
and
faith
we
take
it
did
he
tell
you
so
asked
mrs
mcqueen
he
did
indeed
well
then
i
no
other
word
to
say
and
if
it
must
be
done
the
sooner
the
better
said
mrs
mcqueen
that
night
she
lay
awake
a
long
time
she
was
planning
just
what
they
should
take
with
them
to
their
new
home
and
trying
to
think
what
the
new
home
would
be
like
chapter
sixteen
mr
mcqueen
pays
the
rent
the
next
morning
mr
mcqueen
went
to
mr
conroy
and
paid
the
rent
then
he
said
this
is
the
last
rent
i
be
paying
you
mr
conroy
mr
conroy
was
surprised
what
do
you
mean
by
that
he
said
i
mean
that
i
going
to
leave
old
ireland
said
mr
mcqueen
well
now
cried
mr
conroy
to
think
of
a
sensible
man
like
yourself
leaving
a
good
farm
to
go
off
dear
knows
where
and
you
not
knowing
what
you
do
when
you
get
there
as
like
as
any
way
i
thought
you
had
better
sense
mcqueen
it
because
of
my
better
sense
that
i
going
said
mr
mcqueen
faith
do
you
think
i
be
showing
the
judgment
of
an
old
goat
to
stay
where
every
penny
i
can
get
out
of
the
land
i
have
to
pay
back
in
rent
i
going
to
america
where
there
be
a
chance
for
myself
i
thought
michael
malone
would
be
sowing
the
seeds
of
discontent
in
this
parish
with
his
silk
hats
and
his
grand
talk
said
mr
conroy
angrily
but
i
did
think
you
were
the
fish
to
be
caught
with
fine
words
if
the
seeds
of
discontent
have
been
sown
in
this
parish
terence
conroy
said
mr
mcqueen
is
you
and
the
likes
of
you
that
have
ploughed
and
harrowed
the
ground
ready
for
them
do
you
think
wishful
to
be
leaving
our
old
homes
and
all
our
friends
but
is
you
that
makes
it
too
hard
entirely
for
people
to
stay
and
i
can
tell
you
that
if
you
keep
on
with
others
as
you
have
with
me
raising
the
rent
when
any
work
is
done
to
improve
the
farm
you
be
left
in
time
with
no
tenants
at
all
and
then
where
will
you
be
yourself
terence
conroy
mr
conroy
face
was
red
with
anger
but
he
said
while
i
not
needing
you
to
teach
me
my
duty
i
will
say
this
mcqueen
you
a
good
farmer
and
i
hate
to
see
you
do
a
foolish
thing
for
yourself
if
you
stay
on
the
farm
i
not
raise
the
rent
on
you
you
too
late
altogether
said
mr
mcqueen
and
as
you
said
yourself
i
not
the
fish
to
be
caught
with
fine
words
i
know
better
than
to
believe
you
i
be
sailing
from
queenstown
in
two
time
and
with
that
he
stalked
out
of
the
room
and
slammed
the
door
leaving
mr
conroy
in
a
very
bad
state
of
mind
all
that
larry
and
eileen
could
remember
of
the
next
two
weeks
was
a
queer
jumble
of
tears
and
of
good
wishes
and
blessings
and
strange
strange
feelings
they
had
never
had
before
their
mother
went
about
with
a
white
face
and
red
eyes
and
their
father
was
very
silent
as
he
packed
the
few
household
belongings
they
were
to
take
with
them
to
their
new
home
at
last
the
great
day
came
the
mcqueens
got
up
very
early
that
morning
ate
their
potatoes
and
drank
their
tea
from
a
few
cracked
and
broken
dishes
which
were
to
be
left
behind
then
when
they
had
tidied
up
the
hearth
and
put
on
their
wraps
ready
to
go
mrs
mcqueen
brought
some
water
to
quench
the
fire
on
the
hearth
she
might
almost
have
quenched
it
with
her
tears
and
as
she
poured
the
water
upon
the
ashes
she
crooned
this
little
song
see
note
sadly
to
herself
vein
of
my
heart
from
the
lone
mountain
the
smoke
of
the
turf
will
die
and
the
stream
that
sang
to
the
young
children
run
down
alone
from
the
sky
on
the
doorstone
grass
and
the
cloud
lying
where
they
lie
in
the
old
country
mr
mcqueen
and
the
twins
stood
still
with
their
bundles
in
their
hands
until
she
had
finished
and
risen
from
her
knees
then
they
went
quietly
out
the
door
all
four
together
and
closed
it
after
them
mrs
mcqueen
stooped
to
gather
a
little
bunch
of
shamrock
leaves
which
grew
by
the
doorstone
and
then
the
mcqueen
family
was
quite
quite
ready
for
the
long
journey
mr
maguire
had
bought
colleen
and
the
cows
and
he
was
to
have
the
few
hens
that
were
left
for
taking
the
mcqueen
family
to
the
train
larry
and
eileen
saw
him
coming
up
the
road
here
comes
mr
maguire
with
the
cart
they
cried
and
dennis
is
driving
the
with
michael
and
grannie
on
it
they
soon
reached
the
little
group
by
the
roadside
and
then
the
luggage
was
loaded
into
the
cart
mrs
mcqueen
got
up
with
grannie
on
one
side
of
the
and
eileen
sat
between
them
michael
and
mr
mcqueen
were
on
the
other
side
with
larry
the
small
bags
and
bundles
were
put
in
the
well
of
the
get
up
cried
dennis
and
off
they
started
mrs
mcqueen
looked
back
at
the
old
house
and
cried
into
her
new
shawl
grannie
was
crying
too
but
michael
said
wait
until
you
see
your
new
home
and
sure
you
be
crying
to
think
you
were
in
it
before
and
that
cheered
them
up
again
and
soon
a
turn
in
the
road
hid
the
old
house
from
their
sight
forever
the
luggage
was
heavy
and
colleen
was
slow
so
it
took
several
hours
to
reach
the
railroad
it
took
longer
too
because
all
the
people
in
the
village
ran
out
of
their
houses
to
say
when
they
passed
the
schoolhouse
the
master
gave
the
children
leave
to
say
to
the
twins
he
even
came
out
to
the
road
himself
and
shook
hands
with
everybody
but
for
all
that
when
the
train
came
rattling
into
the
station
there
they
all
were
on
the
platform
in
a
row
ready
to
get
on
board
when
it
stopped
the
guard
jumped
down
and
opened
the
door
of
a
compartment
he
put
grannie
in
first
then
mrs
mcqueen
and
the
twins
they
were
dreadfully
afraid
the
train
would
start
before
mr
mcqueen
and
michael
and
all
the
luggage
were
on
board
it
was
the
first
time
grannie
had
ever
seen
a
train
or
the
twins
either
but
at
last
they
were
all
in
and
the
guard
locked
the
door
larry
and
eileen
looked
out
of
the
window
and
waved
their
hands
to
mr
maguire
and
dennis
the
engine
whistled
the
wheels
began
to
turn
and
above
the
noise
the
twins
heard
dennis
call
out
to
them
sure
i
be
coming
along
to
america
myself
some
day
we
be
watching
for
you
eileen
called
back
then
they
passed
the
station
and
were
soon
racing
along
over
the
open
fields
at
what
seemed
to
poor
grannie
a
fearful
rate
of
speed
murder
murder
she
screamed
is
it
for
this
i
left
my
cabin
to
be
broken
in
bits
on
the
track
like
a
piece
of
old
crockery
wirra
wirra
why
did
i
ever
let
myself
be
persuaded
at
all
ochanee
but
it
is
himself
has
the
soothering
tongue
in
his
mouth
to
coax
his
old
mother
away
for
to
destroy
her
entirely
michael
laughed
and
patted
her
arm
and
whist
now
he
said
sure
never
bring
you
where
harm
would
come
to
you
and
that
you
know
well
look
out
of
the
window
for
is
the
last
you
be
seeing
of
old
ireland
grannie
dried
her
eyes
but
still
she
clung
to
michael
arm
and
when
the
train
went
around
a
curve
she
crossed
herself
and
told
her
beads
as
fast
as
she
could
the
twins
were
not
frightened
they
were
busy
seeing
things
and
besides
larry
had
grannie
piece
of
coal
in
his
pocket
from
the
window
they
caught
glimpses
of
distant
blue
hills
and
of
lakes
still
more
blue
they
passed
by
many
a
brown
bog
and
many
a
green
field
with
farmers
and
farmers
wives
working
in
them
the
hillsides
were
blue
with
blossoming
flax
and
once
they
passed
a
field
all
spread
with
white
linen
bleaching
in
the
sun
they
flew
by
little
towns
with
queer
names
like
ballygrady
and
ballylough
and
once
when
they
were
quite
near
cork
they
saw
the
towers
of
blarney
castle
at
last
the
train
rattled
into
a
great
station
there
was
so
much
noise
from
puffing
engines
and
rumbling
trucks
and
shouting
men
that
the
twins
could
only
take
hold
of
their
mother
hands
and
keep
close
behind
their
father
as
he
followed
michael
with
grannie
clinging
to
him
to
another
train
then
there
were
more
flying
fields
and
a
city
and
more
fields
still
until
they
reached
queenstown
the
next
thing
they
knew
they
were
walking
across
a
gangplank
and
on
to
a
boat
the
twins
had
never
seen
anything
larger
than
a
rowboat
before
and
this
one
looked
very
big
to
them
though
it
was
only
a
lighter
this
lighter
was
to
carry
luggage
and
passengers
from
the
dock
to
the
great
steamer
lying
outside
the
harbour
in
the
deep
water
of
the
main
channel
when
they
were
all
safely
on
board
the
lighter
and
michael
had
counted
their
bundles
to
be
sure
they
had
not
lost
anything
the
twins
and
their
father
and
mother
with
michael
and
grannie
stood
by
the
deck
rail
and
looked
back
at
the
dock
it
was
crowded
with
people
running
to
and
fro
there
were
groups
of
other
emigrants
like
themselves
surrounded
by
great
piles
of
luggage
waiting
for
the
next
lighter
for
one
boat
would
not
carry
all
who
wanted
to
go
there
were
many
being
said
and
many
tears
falling
and
in
the
midst
of
all
the
noise
and
confusion
the
sailors
were
loading
tons
of
barrels
and
bags
and
boxes
and
trunks
on
board
the
ship
there
was
no
friend
to
see
them
off
but
when
they
saw
people
crying
all
about
them
the
twins
cried
a
little
too
for
sympathy
and
even
mr
mcqueen
eyes
were
red
along
the
rims
at
last
the
gangplanks
were
drawn
in
and
the
cables
thrown
off
the
screws
began
to
churn
the
green
water
into
white
foam
and
the
boat
moved
slowly
out
of
the
harbour
the
twins
and
their
father
and
mother
with
grannie
and
michael
stood
by
the
rail
for
a
long
time
and
watched
the
crowd
on
the
pier
until
it
grew
smaller
and
smaller
and
at
last
disappeared
entirely
from
sight
around
a
bend
in
the
channel
they
stood
there
until
the
lighter
reached
the
great
ship
that
was
waiting
to
take
them
across
the
water
to
a
new
world
and
when
at
last
they
were
safely
on
board
and
the
lighters
had
gone
back
empty
into
the
harbour
they
stood
on
the
wide
deck
of
the
ship
with
their
faces
turned
toward
ireland
until
all
they
could
see
of
it
in
the
gathering
dusk
was
a
strip
of
dark
blue
against
the
eastern
sky
with
little
lights
in
cottage
windows
twinkling
from
it
like
tiny
stars
then
they
turned
their
faces
toward
the
bright
western
sky
note
copyright
of
this
poem
by
herbert
trench
held
by
john
lane
chapter
seventeen
twenty
years
after
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
busiest
crossings
in
chicago
there
stands
a
big
man
in
a
blue
uniform
his
eyes
are
blue
and
there
are
wrinkles
in
the
corners
of
them
the
marks
of
many
smiles
on
his
head
is
a
blue
cap
and
under
the
edge
of
the
cap
you
catch
a
glimpse
of
dark
hair
there
are
bands
of
gold
braid
on
his
sleeve
and
on
his
breast
is
a
large
silver
star
he
is
king
of
the
crossing
when
he
blows
his
whistle
all
the
and
automobiles
and
carriages
even
if
it
were
the
carriage
of
the
mayor
himself
stop
then
he
waves
his
hands
and
the
stream
of
people
pours
across
the
street
if
there
is
a
very
small
boy
among
them
the
king
of
the
crossing
sometimes
lays
a
big
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
goes
with
him
to
the
curb
and
he
has
been
known
to
carry
a
small
girl
across
on
his
shoulder
and
set
her
safely
down
on
the
other
side
when
the
people
are
all
across
he
goes
back
to
the
middle
of
the
street
once
more
and
blows
twice
on
his
little
whistle
then
all
the
wheels
that
have
been
standing
as
still
as
if
they
had
gone
to
sleep
suddenly
wake
up
and
go
rolling
down
the
street
while
those
that
have
just
been
turning
stop
and
wait
while
the
big
man
helps
more
people
over
the
crossing
the
other
way
all
day
long
the
king
of
the
crossing
stands
there
blowing
his
whistle
waving
his
hands
and
turning
the
stream
of
people
up
first
one
street
then
the
other
everybody
minds
him
if
everybody
did
they
might
get
run
over
and
wake
up
in
a
hospital
oh
he
must
be
minded
the
king
of
the
crossing
or
nobody
would
be
safe
when
the
long
day
is
over
he
looks
up
the
street
and
sees
another
big
man
coming
this
man
wears
a
blue
uniform
too
and
a
silver
star
and
when
the
hands
on
the
big
clock
at
the
corner
point
to
five
he
steps
into
the
place
of
the
king
of
the
crossing
and
reigns
in
his
stead
then
the
king
jumps
on
to
the
platform
of
a
passing
and
by
and
by
when
it
has
gone
several
miles
he
jumps
off
again
and
walks
up
the
street
to
a
little
house
that
as
neat
as
neat
can
be
it
stands
back
from
the
street
in
a
little
green
yard
the
house
is
painted
white
and
the
front
door
is
green
but
he
does
go
to
the
front
door
he
goes
round
by
the
sidewalk
to
the
kitchen
door
and
there
he
does
even
knock
he
opens
the
door
and
walks
right
in
through
the
open
door
comes
the
smell
of
something
good
cooking
and
he
sees
a
plump
woman
with
blue
eyes
that
have
smile
wrinkles
in
the
corners
just
like
his
own
and
crinkly
dark
hair
just
like
his
own
too
bending
over
the
stove
she
is
just
tasting
the
something
that
smells
so
good
with
a
spoon
when
she
sees
the
big
man
in
the
door
she
tastes
so
quickly
that
she
burns
her
tongue
but
she
can
use
it
just
the
same
even
if
it
is
burned
she
runs
to
the
big
man
and
says
and
is
that
yourself
now
larry
darling
sure
i
that
glad
to
see
you
i
scalded
myself
with
the
soup
the
big
man
has
just
time
to
say
sure
eileen
you
were
always
a
great
one
for
burning
yourself
do
you
remember
that
day
at
grannie
malone
when
out
into
the
kitchen
tumble
a
little
larry
and
a
little
eileen
and
a
baby
they
have
heard
his
voice
and
they
fall
upon
the
king
of
the
crossing
as
if
he
were
a
king
at
all
but
just
a
plain
ordinary
uncle
they
take
off
his
cap
and
rumple
his
hair
they
get
into
his
pockets
and
find
some
peppermints
there
and
the
baby
even
tries
to
get
the
silver
star
off
his
breast
to
put
into
her
mouth
look
at
that
now
cries
uncle
larry
get
along
with
you
is
it
trying
to
take
me
off
the
force
you
are
sure
that
star
was
never
intended
by
the
city
for
you
to
cut
your
teeth
on
she
poison
herself
with
the
things
she
always
after
putting
in
her
mouth
cries
the
mother
she
seizes
the
baby
and
sets
her
in
a
safe
corner
by
herself
gives
her
a
spoon
and
says
there
now
you
can
be
cutting
your
teeth
on
that
and
when
the
children
have
quite
worn
uncle
larry
out
he
sits
upon
the
floor
where
they
have
him
by
this
time
and
runs
his
fingers
through
his
hair
which
is
standing
straight
up
and
says
to
the
mother
sure
eileen
when
you
and
i
were
children
on
the
old
sod
we
were
never
such
spalpeens
as
the
likes
of
these
they
have
me
destroyed
entirely
and
me
the
biggest
policeman
on
the
force
is
it
american
they
are
or
irish
i
want
to
know
it
we
are
shouts
little
larry
and
with
the
heft
of
both
countries
in
your
fists
groans
big
larry
and
then
the
mother
who
has
been
laying
the
table
meanwhile
interferes
come
off
of
your
poor
uncle
she
says
and
be
eating
your
soup
like
gentlemen
and
ladies
it
getting
cold
on
you
waiting
for
you
to
finish
your
antics
your
poor
uncle
larry
wo
come
near
you
at
all
and
you
all
the
time
punishing
him
like
that
and
then
the
baby
still
sucking
her
spoon
is
lifted
into
her
high
chair
a
chair
is
placed
for
uncle
larry
and
they
all
eat
their
soup
around
the
kitchen
table
just
as
the
very
last
rays
of
the
summer
sun
make
long
streaks
of
light
across
the
kitchen
floor
where
dennis
says
uncle
larry
while
the
children
are
quiet
for
a
moment
oh
it
himself
is
so
late
that
i
feed
the
children
and
put
them
to
bed
before
he
gets
home
at
all
says
the
mother
it
little
he
sees
of
them
except
of
a
sunday
it
likely
he
live
the
longer
for
that
says
uncle
larry
he
looks
reproachfully
at
the
children
and
rubs
his
head
and
then
mother
tell
us
what
kind
of
a
boy
was
uncle
larry
when
you
and
he
were
twins
and
lived
in
ireland
says
little
eileen
the
best
in
the
width
of
the
world
says
her
mother
promptly
were
you
larry
speak
up
and
tell
them
now
and
uncle
larry
laughs
and
says
sure
i
was
too
good
entirely
it
would
be
modest
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
myself
tell
us
about
mother
then
says
little
eileen
was
she
the
best
in
the
width
of
the
world
too
sure
i
never
be
telling
tales
on
my
only
twin
sister
says
uncle
larry
beyond
telling
you
that
there
was
many
another
in
green
old
ireland
just
like
her
whatever
kind
she
was
but
i
ca
stay
here
wearing
out
my
tongue
look
out
the
window
the
chickens
have
gone
to
roost
and
the
sun
is
down
so
get
along
with
you
to
your
beds
when
he
had
gone
and
the
children
were
in
bed
and
the
house
quiet
the
mother
sat
down
by
the
light
in
the
kitchen
with
a
basket
of
mending
beside
her
and
while
she
darned
and
mended
and
waited
for
himself
to
come
home
she
remembered
and
remembered
about
when
she
was
little
eileen
herself
and
the
king
of
the
crossing
was
just
her
twin
brother
larry
and
this
book
is
what
she
remembered
the
end
appendix
suggestions
to
teachers
like
the
author
earlier
books
the
dutch
twins
and
the
japanese
twins
this
reader
aims
to
foster
a
kindly
feeling
and
a
deserved
respect
for
a
country
whose
children
have
come
to
form
a
numerous
portion
of
our
own
population
to
arouse
the
children
interest
and
thus
to
make
the
reading
of
this
story
most
valuable
as
a
school
exercise
it
is
suggested
that
at
the
outset
the
children
be
allowed
to
look
at
the
pictures
in
the
book
in
order
to
get
acquainted
with
larry
and
eileen
and
with
the
scenes
illustrating
their
home
life
and
surroundings
during
the
reading
point
out
ireland
on
a
map
of
the
world
or
on
a
globe
and
tell
the
children
something
about
the
unique
character
of
the
country
thus
connecting
this
supplementary
reading
material
with
the
work
in
geography
the
text
is
so
simply
written
that
any
fourth
or
fifth
grade
child
can
read
it
without
much
preparation
in
the
fourth
grade
it
may
be
well
to
have
the
children
read
it
first
in
a
study
period
in
order
to
work
out
the
pronunciation
of
the
more
difficult
words
in
the
fifth
grade
the
children
can
usually
read
it
at
sight
without
the
preparatory
study
give
little
attention
to
the
expressions
in
dialect
let
the
children
read
them
naturally
and
they
will
enhance
the
dramatic
effect
of
the
story
the
possibilities
in
the
story
for
dramatisation
and
for
language
and
constructive
work
will
be
immediately
apparent
in
connection
with
the
reading
of
the
book
teachers
should
read
or
tell
to
the
children
stories
of
irish
life
and
from
irish
for
example
the
story
of
the
little
rid
hin
the
dagda
harp
and
the
tailor
and
the
three
beasts
in
sara
cone
bryant
to
tell
to
and
billy
beg
and
his
bull
in
the
same
author
to
tell
stories
to
material
which
may
readily
be
adapted
to
this
use
will
be
found
in
johnston
and
spencer
let
the
children
bring
to
class
postcards
and
other
pictures
of
scenes
in
ireland
the
unique
illustrations
in
the
irish
twins
should
be
much
used
both
in
the
reading
of
the
story
and
in
other
ways
children
will
enjoy
sketching
some
of
them
their
simple
treatment
makes
them
especially
useful
for
this
purpose
the
book
is
printed
on
paper
which
will
take
water
colour
well
and
where
books
are
individually
owned
some
of
the
sketches
could
be
used
for
colouring
in
flat
washes
they
also
afford
suggestions
for
action
sketching
by
the
children
an
excellent
oral
language
exercise
would
be
for
the
children
after
they
have
read
the
story
to
take
turns
telling
the
story
from
the
illustrations
and
a
good
composition
exercise
would
be
for
each
child
to
select
the
illustration
that
he
would
like
to
write
upon
make
a
sketch
of
it
and
write
the
story
in
his
own
words
these
are
only
a
few
of
the
many
ways
that
will
occur
to
resourceful
teachers
for
making
the
book
a
valuable
as
well
as
an
enjoyable
exercise
in
reading
