frankly
be
confessed
racial

is

of

its

what

can
rival
in
interest
this
ancient
of
days
there
are
those
nevertheless
who
would
write
universal
history
and
leave
out
africa
but
how
asks
ratzel
can
one
leave
out
the
land
of
egypt
and
carthage
and
frobenius
declares
that
in
future
africa
must
more
and
more
be
regarded
as
an
integral
part
of
the
great
movement
of
world
history
yet
it
is
true
that
the
history
of
africa
is
unusual
and
its
strangeness
is
due
in
no
small
degree
to
the
physical
peculiarities
of
the
continent
with
three
times
the
area
of
europe
it
has
a
coast
line
a
fifth
shorter
like
europe
it
is
a
peninsula
of
asia
curving
southwestward
around
the
indian
sea
it
has
few
gulfs
bays
capes
or
islands
even
the
rivers
though
large
and
long
are
not
means
of
communication
with
the
outer
world
because
from
the
central
high
plateau
they
plunge
in
rapids
and
cataracts
to
the
narrow
coastlands
and
the
sea
the
general
physical
contour
of
africa
has
been
likened
to
an
inverted
plate
with
one
or
more
rows
of
mountains
at
the
edge
and
a
low
coastal
belt
in
the
south
the
central
plateau
is
three
thousand
or
more
feet
above
the
sea
while
in
the
north
it
is
a
little
over
one
thousand
feet
thus
two
main
divisions
of
the
continent
are
easily
distinguished
the
broad
northern
rectangle
reaching
down
as
far
as
the
gulf
of
guinea
and
cape
guardafui
with
seven
million
square
miles
and
the
peninsula
which
tapers
toward
the
south
with
five
million
square
miles
four
great
rivers
and
many
lesser
streams
water
the
continent
the
greatest
is
the
congo
in
the
center
with
its
vast
curving
and
endless
estuaries
then
the
nile
draining
the
cluster
of
the
great
lakes
and
flowing
northward
like
some
grave
mighty
thought
threading
a
dream
the
niger
in
the
northwest
watering
the
sudan
below
the
sahara
and
finally
the
zambesi
with
its
greater
niagara
in
the
southeast
even
these
waters
leave
room
for
deserts
both
south
and
north
but
the
greater
ones
are
the
three
million
square
miles
of
sand
wastes
in
the
north
more
than
any
other
land
africa
lies
in
the
tropics
with
a
warm
dry
climate
save
in
the
central
congo
region
where
rain
at
all
seasons
brings
tropical
luxuriance
the
flora
is
rich
but
not
wide
in
variety
including
the
gum
acacia
ebony
several
dye
woods
the
kola
nut
and
probably
tobacco
and
millet
to
these
many
plants
have
been
added
in
historic
times
the
fauna
is
rich
in
mammals
and
here
too
many
from
other
continents
have
been
widely
introduced
and
used
primarily
africa
is
the
land
of
the
blacks
the
world
has
always
been
familiar
with
black
men
who
represent
one
of
the
most
ancient
of
human
stocks
of
the
ancient
world
gathered
about
the
mediterranean
they
formed
a
part
and
were
viewed
with
no
surprise
or
dislike
because
this
world
saw
them
come
and
go
and
play
their
part
with
other
men
was
clitus
the
of
alexander
the
great
less
to
be
honored
because
he
happened
to
be
black
was
terence
less
famous
the
medieval
european
world
developing
under
the
favorable
physical
conditions
of
the
north
temperate
zone
knew
the
black
man
chiefly
as
a
legend
or
occasional
curiosity
but
still
as
a
fellow
man
an
othello
or
a
prester
john
or
an
antar
the
modern
world
in
contrast
knows
the
negro
chiefly
as
a
bond
slave
in
the
west
indies
and
america
add
to
this
the
fact
that
the
darker
races
in
other
parts
of
the
world
have
in
the
last
four
centuries
lagged
behind
the
flying
and
even
feverish
footsteps
of
europe
and
we
face
a
widespread
assumption
throughout
the
dominant
world
that
color
is
a
mark
of
inferiority
the
result
is
that
in
writing
of
this
one
of
the
most
ancient
persistent
and
widespread
stocks
of
mankind
one
faces
astounding
prejudice
that
which
may
be
assumed
as
true
of
white
men
must
be
proven
beyond
peradventure
if
it
relates
to
negroes
one
who
writes
of
the
development
of
the
negro
race
must
continually
insist
that
he
is
writing
of
a
normal
human
stock
and
that
whatever
it
is
fair
to
predicate
of
the
mass
of
human
beings
may
be
predicated
of
the
negro
it
is
the
silent
refusal
to
do
this
which
has
led
to
so
much
false
writing
on
africa
and
of
its
inhabitants
take
for
instance
the
answer
to
the
apparently
simple
question
what
is
a
negro
we
find
the
most
extraordinary
confusion
of
thought
and
difference
of
opinion
there
is
a
certain
type
in
the
minds
of
most
people
which
as
david
livingstone
said
can
be
found
only
in
caricature
and
not
in
real
life
when
scientists
have
tried
to
find
an
extreme
type
of
black
ugly
and
negro
they
have
been
compelled
more
and
more
to
limit
his
home
even
in
africa
at
least
of
the
african
people
do
not
at
all
conform
to
this
type
and
the
typical
negro
after
being
denied
a
dwelling
place
in
the
sudan
along
the
nile
in
east
central
africa
and
in
south
africa
was
finally
given
a
very
small
country
between
the
senegal
and
the
niger
and
even
there
was
found
to
give
trace
of
many
stocks
as
winwood
reade
says
the
typical
negro
is
a
rare
variety
even
among
negroes
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
can
not
take
such
extreme
and
largely
fanciful
stock
as
typifying
that
which
we
may
fairly
call
the
negro
race
in
the
case
of
no
other
race
is
so
narrow
a
definition
attempted
a
white
man
may
be
of
any
color
size
or
facial
conformation
and
have
endless
variety
of
cranial
measurement
and
physical
characteristics
a
yellow
man
is
perhaps
an
even
vaguer
conception
in
fact
it
is
generally
recognized
that
no
scientific
definition
of
race
is
possible
differences
and
striking
differences
there
are
between
men
and
groups
of
men
but
they
fade
into
each
other
so
insensibly
that
we
can
only
indicate
the
main
divisions
of
men
in
broad
outlines
as
von
luschan
says
the
question
of
the
number
of
human
races
has
quite
lost
its
and
has
become
a
subject
rather
of
philosophic
speculation
than
of
scientific
research
it
is
of
no
more
importance
now
to
know
how
many
human
races
there
are
than
to
know
how
many
angels
can
dance
on
the
point
of
a
needle
our
aim
now
is
to
find
out
how
ancient
and
primitive
races
developed
from
others
and
how
races
changed
or
evolved
through
migration
and
the
mulatto
using
the
term
loosely
to
indicate
either
an
intermediate
type
between
white
and
black
or
a
mingling
of
the
two
is
as
typically
african
as
the
black
man
and
can
not
logically
be
included
in
the
white
race
especially
when
american
usage
includes
the
mulatto
in
the
negro
race
it
is
reasonable
according
to
fact
and
historic
usage
to
include
under
the
word
negro
the
darker
peoples
of
africa
characterized
by
a
brown
skin
curled
or
frizzled
hair
full
and
sometimes
everted
lips
a
tendency
to
a
development
of
the
maxillary
parts
of
the
face
and
a
dolichocephalic
head
this
type
is
not
fixed
or
definite
the
color
varies
widely
it
is
never
black
or
bluish
as
some
say
and
it
becomes
often
light
brown
or
yellow
the
hair
varies
from
curly
to
a
mass
and
the
facial
angle
and
cranial
form
show
wide
variation
it
is
as
impossible
in
africa
as
elsewhere
to
fix
with
any
certainty
the
limits
of
racial
variation
due
to
climate
and
the
variation
due
to
intermingling
in
the
past
when
scientists
assumed
one
unvarying
negro
type
every
variation
from
that
type
was
interpreted
as
meaning
mixture
of
blood
we
recognize
a
broader
normal
african
type
which
as
palgrave
says
may
best
be
studied
among
the
statues
of
the
egyptian
rooms
of
the
british
museum
the
larger
gentle
eye
the
full
but
not
lips
the
rounded
contour
and
the
easy
sensuous
expression
this
is
the
genuine
african
model
to
this
race
africa
in
the
main
and
parts
of
asia
have
belonged
since
prehistoric
times
the
color
of
this
variety
of
man
as
the
color
of
other
varieties
is
due
to
climate
conditions
of
heat
cold
and
moisture
working
for
thousands
of
years
through
the
skin
and
other
organs
have
given
men
their
differences
of
color
this
color
pigment
is
a
protection
against
sunlight
and
consequently
varies
with
the
intensity
of
the
sunlight
thus
in
africa
we
find
the
blackest
men
in
the
fierce
sunlight
of
the
desert
red
pygmies
in
the
forest
and
yellow
bushmen
on
the
cooler
southern
plateau
next
to
the
color
the
hair
is
the
most
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
negro
but
the
two
characteristics
do
not
vary
with
each
other
some
of
the
blackest
of
the
negroes
have
curly
rather
than
woolly
hair
while
the
crispest
most
closely
curled
hair
is
found
among
the
yellow
hottentots
and
bushmen
the
difference
between
the
hair
of
the
lighter
and
darker
races
is
a
difference
of
degree
not
of
kind
and
can
be
easily
measured
if
the
hair
follicles
of
a
a
european
and
a
negro
are
cut
across
transversely
it
will
be
found
that
the
diameter
of
the
first
is
by
to
the
second
by
to
while
that
of
the
negro
is
by
to
this
elliptical
form
of
the
negro
hair
causes
it
to
curl
more
or
less
tightly
there
have
been
repeated
efforts
to
discover
by
measurements
of
various
kinds
further
and
more
decisive
differences
which
would
serve
as
really
scientific
determinants
of
race
gradually
these
efforts
have
been
given
up
we
realize
that
there
are
no
hard
and
fast
racial
types
among
men
race
is
a
dynamic
and
not
a
static
conception
and
the
typical
races
are
continually
changing
and
developing
amalgamating
and
differentiating
in
this
little
book
then
we
are
studying
the
history
of
the
darker
part
of
the
human
family
which
is
separated
from
the
rest
of
mankind
by
no
absolute
physical
line
but
which
nevertheless
forms
as
a
mass
a
social
group
distinct
in
history
appearance
and
to
some
extent
in
spiritual
gift
we
can
not
study
africa
without
however
noting
some
of
the
other
races
concerned
in
its
history
particularly
the
asiatic
semites
the
intercourse
of
africa
with
arabia
and
other
parts
of
asia
has
been
so
close
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
disentangle
the
blood
relationships
negro
blood
certainly
appears
in
strong
strain
among
the
semites
and
the
obvious
mulatto
groups
in
africa
arising
from
ancient
and
modern
mingling
of
semite
and
negro
has
given
rise
to
the
term
hamite
under
cover
of
which
millions
of
negroids
have
been
characteristically
transferred
to
the
white
race
by
some
eager
scientists
the
earliest
semites
came
to
africa
across
the
red
sea
the
phoenicians
came
along
the
northern
coasts
a
thousand
years
before
christ
and
began
settlements
which
culminated
in
carthage
and
extended
down
the
atlantic
shores
of
north
africa
nearly
to
the
gulf
of
guinea
from
the
earliest
times
the
greeks
have
been
in
contact
with
africa
as
visitors
traders
and
colonists
and
the
persian
influence
came
with
cambyses
and
others
roman
africa
was
bounded
by
the
desert
but
at
times
came
into
contact
with
the
blacks
across
the
sahara
and
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
after
the
breaking
up
of
the
roman
empire
the
greek
and
latin
christians
filtered
through
africa
followed
finally
by
a
germanic
invasion
in
in
the
seventh
century
the
asia
claimed
africa
again
for
her
own
and
blew
a
cloud
of
semitic
mohammedanism
all
across
north
africa
veiling
the
dark
continent
from
europe
for
a
thousand
years
and
converting
vast
masses
of
the
blacks
to
islam
the
portuguese
began
to
raise
the
veil
in
the
fifteenth
century
sailing
down
the
atlantic
coast
and
initiating
the
modern
slave
trade
the
spanish
french
dutch
and
english
followed
them
but
as
traders
in
men
rather
than
explorers
the
portuguese
explored
the
coasts
of
the
gulf
of
guinea
visiting
the
interior
kingdoms
and
then
passing
by
the
mouth
of
the
congo
proceeded
southward
eventually
they
rounded
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
pursued
their
explorations
as
far
as
the
mountains
of
abyssinia
this
began
the
modern
exploration
of
africa
which
is
a
curious
fairy
tale
and
recalls
to
us
the
great
names
of
livingstone
burton
speke
stanley
barth
schweinfurth
and
many
others
in
this
way
africa
has
been
made
known
to
the
modern
world
the
difficulty
of
this
modern
lifting
of
the
veil
of
centuries
emphasizes
two
physical
facts
that
underlie
all
african
history
the
peculiar
inaccessibility
of
the
continent
to
peoples
from
without

the

the
coming
of
black
men
the
movements
of
prehistoric
man
can
be
seen
as
yet
but
dimly
in
the
uncertain
mists
of
time
this
is
the
story
that
seems
most
probable
from
some
center
in
southern
asia
primitive
human
beings
began
to
differentiate
in
two
directions
toward
the
south
appeared
the
primitive
negro
and
with
flattened
hair
follicle
he
spread
along
southern
asia
and
passed
over
into
africa
where
he
survives
as
the
reddish
dwarfs
of
the
center
and
the
bushmen
of
south
africa
northward
and
eastward
primitive
man
became
broader
headed
and
and
spread
over
eastern
asia
forming
the
mongolian
type
either
through
the
intermingling
of
these
two
types
or
as
some
prefer
to
think
by
the
direct
prolongation
of
the
original
primitive
man
a
third
intermediate
type
of
human
being
appeared
with
hair
and
cranial
measurement
intermediate
between
the
primitive
negro
and
mongolian
all
these
three
types
of
men
intermingled
their
blood
freely
and
developed
variations
according
to
climate
and
environment
other
and
older
theories
and
legends
of
the
origin
and
spread
of
mankind
are
of
interest
now
only
because
so
many
human
beings
have
believed
them
in
the
past
the
biblical
story
of
shem
ham
and
japheth
retains
the
interest
of
a
primitive
myth
with
its
measure
of
allegorical
truth
but
has
of
course
no
historic
basis
the
older
aryan
theory
assumed
the
migration
into
europe
of
one
dominant
asiatic
race
of
civilized
conquerors
to
whose
blood
and
influence
all
modern
culture
was
due
to
this
white
race
semitic
asia
a
large
part
of
black
africa
and
all
europe
was
supposed
to
belong
this
aryan
theory
has
been
practically
abandoned
in
the
light
of
recent
research
and
it
seems
probable
now
that
from
the
primitive
negroid
stock
evolved
in
asia
the
semites
either
by
local
variation
or
intermingling
with
other
stocks
later
there
developed
the
mediterranean
race
with
negroid
characteristics
and
the
modern
negroes
the
germanic
people
may
have
arisen
as
a
modern
variation
of
the
mixed
peoples
produced
by
the
mingling
of
asiatic
and
african
elements
the
last
word
on
this
development
has
not
yet
been
said
and
there
is
still
much
to
learn
and
explain
but
it
is
certainly
proved
beyond
doubt
that
the
hamites
of
africa
the
brown
and
black
curly
and
inhabitants
of
north
and
east
africa
are
not
white
men
if
we
draw
the
line
between
white
and
black
in
any
logical
way
the
primitive
negroid
race
of
men
developed
in
asia
wandered
eastward
as
well
as
westward
they
entered
on
the
one
hand
burmah
and
the
south
sea
islands
and
on
the
other
hand
they
came
through
mesopotamia
and
gave
curly
hair
and
a
negroid
type
to
jew
syrian
and
assyrian
ancient
statues
of
indian
divinities
show
the
negro
type
with
black
face
and
hair
and
early
babylonian
culture
was
negroid
in
arabia
the
negroes
may
have
divided
and
one
stream
perhaps
wandered
into
europe
by
way
of
syria
traces
of
these
negroes
are
manifest
not
only
in
skeletons
but
in
the
brunette
type
of
all
south
europe
the
other
branch
proceeded
to
egypt
and
tropical
africa
another
but
perhaps
less
probable
theory
is
that
ancient
negroes
may
have
entered
africa
from
europe
since
the
most
ancient
skulls
of
algeria
are
negroid
the
primitive
african
was
not
an
extreme
type
one
may
judge
from
modern
pygmy
and
bushmen
that
his
color
was
reddish
or
yellow
and
his
skull
was
sometimes
round
like
the
mongolian
he
entered
africa
not
less
than
fifty
thousand
years
ago
and
settled
eventually
in
the
broad
region
between
lake
chad
and
the
great
lakes
and
remained
there
long
stretches
of
years
after
a
lapse
of
perhaps
thirty
thousand
years
there
entered
africa
a
further
migration
of
asiatic
people
negroid
in
many
characteristics
but
lighter
and
straighter
haired
than
the
primitive
negroes
from
this
mediterranean
race
was
developed
the
modern
inhabitants
of
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
in
europe
asia
and
africa
and
by
mingling
with
the
primitive
negroes
the
ancient
egyptians
and
modern
negroid
races
of
africa
as
we
near
historic
times
the
migrations
of
men
became
more
frequent
from
asia
and
from
europe
and
in
africa
came
movements
and
minglings
which
give
to
the
whole
of
africa
a
distinct
mulatto
character
the
primitive
negro
stock
was
mulatto
in
the
sense
of
being
not
widely
differentiated
from
the
dark
original
australoid
stock
as
the
earlier
yellow
negro
developed
in
the
african
tropics
to
the
bigger
blacker
type
he
was
continually
mingling
his
blood
with
similar
types
developed
in
temperate
climes
to
sallower
color
and
straighter
hair
we
find
therefore
in
africa
every
degree
of
development
in
negroid
stocks
and
every
degree
of
intermingling
of
these
developments
both
among
african
peoples
and
between
africans
europeans
and
asiatics
the
mistake
is
continually
made
of
considering
these
types
as
transitions
between
absolute
caucasians
and
absolute
negroes
no
such
absolute
type
ever
existed
on
either
side
both
were
slowly
differentiated
from
a
common
ancestry
and
continually
remingled
their
blood
while
the
differentiating
was
progressing
from
prehistoric
times
down
to
africa
is
in
this
sense
primarily
the
land
of
the
mulatto
so
too
was
earlier
europe
and
asia
only
in
these
countries
the
mulatto
was
early
bleached
by
the
climate
while
in
africa
he
was
darkened
it
is
not
easy
to
summarize
the
history
of
these
dark
african
peoples
because
so
little
is
known
and
so
much
is
still
in
dispute
yet
by
avoiding
the
real
controversies
and
being
unafraid
of
mere
questions
of
definition
we
may
trace
a
great
human
movement
with
considerable
definiteness
three
main
negro
types
early
made
their
appearance
the
lighter
and
smaller
primitive
stock
the
larger
forest
negro
in
the
center
and
on
the
west
coast
and
the
tall
black
nilotic
negro
in
the
eastern
sudan
in
the
earliest
times
we
find
the
negroes
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
pressing
downward
from
the
interior
here
they
mingled
with
semitic
types
and
after
a
lapse
of
millenniums
there
arose
from
this
mingling
the
culture
of
ethiopia
and
egypt
probably
the
first
of
higher
human
cultures
to
the
west
of
the
nile
the
negroes
expanded
straight
across
the
continent
to
the
atlantic
centers
of
higher
culture
appeared
very
early
along
the
gulf
of
guinea
and
curling
backward
met
egyptian
ethiopian
and
even
european
and
asiatic
influences
about
lake
chad
to
the
southeast
nearer
the
primitive
seats
of
the
earliest
african
immigrants
and
open
to
egyptian
and
east
indian
influences
the
negro
culture
which
culminated
at
zymbabwe
arose
and
one
may
trace
throughout
south
africa
its
wide
ramifications
all
these
movements
gradually
aroused
the
central
tribes
to
unrest
they
beat
against
the
barriers
north
northeast
and
west
but
gradually
settled
into
a
great
southeastward
migration
calling
themselves
proudly
la
bantu
the
people
they
grew
by
agglomeration
into
a
warlike
nation
speaking
one
language
they
eventually
conquered
all
africa
south
of
the
gulf
of
guinea
and
spread
their
influence
to
the
northward
while
these
great
movements
were
slowly
transforming
africa
she
was
also
receiving
influences
from
beyond
her
shores
and
sending
influences
out
with
mulatto
egypt
black
africa
was
always
in
closest
touch
so
much
so
that
to
some
all
evidence
of
negro
uplift
seem
egyptian
in
origin
the
truth
is
rather
that
egypt
was
herself
always
palpably
negroid
and
from
her
vantage
ground
as
almost
the
only
african
gateway
received
and
transmitted
negro
ideals
phoenician
greek
and
roman
came
into
touch
more
or
less
with
black
africa
carthage
that
north
african
city
of
a
million
men
had
a
large
caravan
trade
with
negroland
in
ivory
metals
cloth
precious
stones
and
slaves
black
men
served
in
the
carthaginian
armies
and
marched
with
hannibal
on
rome
in
some
of
the
north
african
kingdoms
the
infiltration
of
negro
blood
was
very
large
and
kings
like
massinissa
and
jugurtha
were
negroid
by
way
of
the
atlantic
the
carthaginians
reached
the
african
west
coast
greek
and
roman
influences
came
through
the
desert
and
the
byzantine
empire
and
persia
came
into
communication
with
negroland
by
way
of
the
valley
of
the
nile
the
influence
of
these
trade
routes
added
to
those
of
egypt
ethiopia
benin
and
yoruba
stimulated
centers
of
culture
in
the
central
and
western
sudan
and
european
and
african
trade
early
reached
large
volume
negro
soldiers
were
used
largely
in
the
armies
that
enabled
the
mohammedans
to
conquer
north
africa
and
spain
beginning
in
the
tenth
century
and
slowly
creeping
across
the
desert
into
negroland
the
new
religion
found
an
already
existent
culture
and
came
not
a
conqueror
but
as
an
adapter
and
inspirer
civilization
received
new
impetus
and
a
wave
of
mohammedanism
swept
eastward
erecting
the
great
kingdoms
of
melle
the
songhay
bornu
and
the
hausa
states
the
older
negro
culture
was
not
overthrown
but
like
a
great
wedge
pushed
upward
and
inward
from
yoruba
and
gave
stubborn
battle
to
the
newer
culture
for
seven
or
eight
centuries
then
it
was
in
the
fifteenth
century
that
the
heart
disease
of
africa
developed
in
its
most
virulent
form
there
is
a
modern
theory
that
black
men
are
and
always
have
been
naturally
slaves
nothing
is
further
from
the
truth
in
the
ancient
world
africa
was
no
more
a
slave
hunting
ground
than
europe
or
asia
and
both
greece
and
rome
had
much
larger
numbers
of
white
slaves
than
of
black
it
was
natural
that
a
stream
of
black
slaves
should
have
poured
into
egypt
because
the
chief
line
of
egyptian
conquest
and
defense
lay
toward
the
heart
of
africa
moreover
the
egyptians
themselves
of
negro
descent
had
not
only
negro
slaves
but
negroes
among
their
highest
nobility
and
even
among
their
pharaohs
mohammedan
conquerors
enslaved
peoples
of
all
colors
in
europe
asia
and
africa
but
eventually
their
empire
centered
in
asia
and
africa
and
their
slaves
came
principally
from
these
countries
asia
submitted
to
islam
except
in
the
far
east
which
was
negro
africa
submitted
only
partially
and
the
remaining
heathen
were
in
small
states
which
could
not
effectively
protect
themselves
against
the
mohammedan
slave
trade
in
this
wise
the
slave
trade
gradually
began
to
center
in
africa
for
religious
and
political
rather
than
for
racial
reasons
the
typical
african
culture
was
the
culture
of
family
town
and
small
tribe
hence
domestic
slavery
easily
developed
a
slave
trade
through
war
and
commerce
only
the
integrating
force
of
state
building
could
have
stopped
this
slave
trade
was
this
failure
to
develop
the
great
state
a
racial
characteristic
this
does
not
seem
a
fair
conclusion
in
four
great
centers
state
building
began
in
africa
in
ethiopia
several
large
states
were
built
up
but
they
tottered
before
the
onslaughts
of
egypt
persia
rome
and
byzantium
on
the
one
hand
and
finally
fell
before
the
turbulent
bantu
warriors
from
the
interior
the
second
attempt
at
empire
building
began
in
the
southeast
but
the
same
bantu
hordes
pressing
now
slowly
now
fiercely
from
the
congested
center
of
the
continent
gradually
overthrew
this
state
and
erected
on
its
ruins
a
series
of
smaller
and
more
transient
kingdoms
the
third
attempt
at
state
building
arose
on
the
guinea
coast
in
benin
and
yoruba
it
never
got
much
beyond
a
federation
of
large
industrial
cities
its
expansion
toward
the
congo
valley
was
probably
a
prime
cause
of
the
original
bantu
movements
to
the
southeast
toward
the
north
and
northeast
on
the
other
hand
these
met
the
sudanese
armed
with
the
new
imperial
mohammedan
idea
just
as
latin
rome
gave
the
imperial
idea
to
the
nordic
races
so
islam
brought
this
idea
to
the
sudan
in
the
consequent
attempts
at
imperialism
in
the
western
sudan
there
arose
the
largest
of
the
african
empires
two
circumstances
however
militated
against
this
empire
building
first
the
fierce
resistance
of
the
heathen
south
made
war
continuous
and
slaves
one
of
the
articles
of
systematic
commerce
secondly
the
highways
of
legitimate
african
commerce
had
for
millenniums
lain
to
the
north
these
were
suddenly
closed
by
the
moors
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
the
negro
empires
were
thrown
into
the
turmoil
of
internal
war
it
was
then
that
the
european
slave
traders
came
from
the
southwest
they
found
partially
disrupted
negro
states
on
the
west
coast
and
falling
empires
in
the
sudan
together
with
the
old
unrest
of
and
migration
in
the
valley
of
the
congo
they
not
only
offered
a
demand
for
the
usual
slave
trade
but
they
increased
it
to
an
enormous
degree
until
their
demand
added
to
the
demand
of
the
mohammedan
in
africa
and
asia
made
human
beings
the
highest
priced
article
of
commerce
in
africa
under
such
circumstances
there
could
be
but
one
end
the
virtual
uprooting
of
ancient
african
culture
leaving
only
misty
reminders
of
the
ruin
in
the
customs
and
work
of
the
people
to
complete
this
disaster
came
the
partition
of
the
continent
among
european
nations
and
the
modern
attempt
to
exploit
the
country
and
the
natives
for
the
economic
benefit
of
the
white
world
together
with
the
transplanting
of
black
nations
to
the
new

their
rise

ethiopia
and

having
viewed
now
the
land
and
movements
of
african
people
in
main
outline
let
us
scan
more
narrowly
the
history
of
five
main
centers
of
activity
and
culture
namely
the
valleys
of
the
nile
and
of
the
congo
the
borders
of
the
great
gulf
of
guinea
the
sudan
and
south
africa
these
divisions
do
not
cover
all
of
negro
africa
but
they
take
in
the
main
areas
and
the
main
lines
in
development
first
we
turn
to
the
valley
of
the
nile
perhaps
the
most
ancient
of
known
seats
of
civilization
in
the
world
and
certainly
the
oldest
in
africa
with
a
culture
reaching
back
six
or
eight
thousand
years
like
all
civilizations
it
drew
largely
from
without
and
undoubtedly
arose
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
because
that
valley
was
so
easily
made
a
center
for
the
meeting
of
men
of
all
types
and
from
all
parts
of
the
world
at
the
same
time
egyptian
civilization
seems
to
have
been
african
in
its
beginnings
and
in
its
main
line
of
development
despite
strong
influences
from
all
parts
of
asia
of
what
race
then
were
the
egyptians
they
certainly
were
not
white
in
any
sense
of
the
modern
use
of
that
word
neither
in
color
nor
physical
measurement
in
hair
nor
countenance
in
language
nor
social
customs
they
stood
in
relationship
nearest
the
negro
race
in
earliest
times
and
then
gradually
through
the
infiltration
of
mediterranean
and
semitic
elements
became
what
would
be
described
in
america
as
a
light
mulatto
stock
of
octoroons
or
quadroons
this
stock
was
varied
continually
now
by
new
infiltration
of
negro
blood
from
the
south
now
by
negroid
and
semitic
blood
from
the
east
now
by
berber
types
from
the
north
and
west
egyptian
monuments
show
distinctly
negro
and
mulatto
faces
herodotus
in
an
incontrovertible
passage
alludes
to
the
egyptians
as
black
and
a
peculiarly
significant
statement
from
one
used
to
the
brunette
mediterranean
type
in
another
passage
concerning
the
fable
of
the
dodonian
oracle
he
again
alludes
to
the
swarthy
color
of
the
egyptians
as
exceedingly
dark
and
even
black
æschylus
mentioning
a
boat
seen
from
the
shore
declares
that
its
crew
are
egyptians
because
of
their
black
complexions
modern
measurements
with
all
their
admitted
limitations
show
that
in
the
thebaid
from
to
of
the
egyptian
population
were
negroes
and
that
of
the
predynastic
egyptians
less
than
half
could
be
classed
as
judging
from
measurements
in
the
tombs
of
nobles
as
late
as
the
eighteenth
dynasty
negroes
form
at
least
of
the
higher
class
such
measurements
are
by
no
means
conclusive
but
they
are
apt
to
be
under
rather
than
over
statements
of
the
prevalence
of
negro
blood
head
measurements
of
negro
americans
would
probably
place
most
of
them
in
the
category
of
whites
the
evidence
of
language
also
connects
egypt
with
africa
and
the
negro
race
rather
than
with
asia
while
religious
ceremonies
and
social
customs
all
go
to
strengthen
this
evidence
the
ethnic
history
of
northeast
africa
would
seem
therefore
to
have
been
this
predynastic
egypt
was
settled
by
negroes
from
ethiopia
they
were
of
varied
type
the
type
to
which
the
word
negro
is
sometimes
confined
the
black
sharper
featured
type
which
must
be
considered
an
equally
negroid
variation
these
negroes
met
and
mingled
with
the
invading
mediterranean
race
from
north
africa
and
asia
thus
the
blood
of
the
sallower
race
spread
south
and
that
of
the
darker
race
north
black
priests
appear
in
crete
three
thousand
years
before
christ
and
arabia
is
to
this
day
thoroughly
permeated
with
negro
blood
perhaps
as
chamberlain
says
one
of
the
prime
reasons
why
no
civilization
of
the
type
of
that
of
the
nile
arose
in
other
parts
of
the
continent
if
such
a
thing
were
at
all
possible
was
that
egypt
acted
as
a
sort
of
channel
by
which
the
genius
of
was
drafted
off
into
the
service
of
mediterranean
and
asiatic
culture
to
one
familiar
with
the
striking
and
beautiful
types
arising
from
the
mingling
of
negro
with
latin
and
germanic
types
in
america
the
puzzle
of
the
egyptian
type
is
easily
solved
it
was
unlike
any
of
its
neighbors
and
a
unique
type
until
one
views
the
modern
mulatto
then
the
faces
of
rahotep
and
nefert
of
khafra
and
amenemhat
i
of
aahmes
and
nefertari
and
even
of
the
great
ramessu
ii
become
curiously
familiar
the
history
of
egypt
is
a
science
in
itself
before
the
reign
of
the
first
recorded
king
five
thousand
years
or
more
before
christ
there
had
already
existed
in
egypt
a
culture
and
art
arising
by
long
evolution
from
the
days
of
paleolithic
man
among
a
distinctly
negroid
people
about
began
the
first
of
three
successive
egyptian
empires
this
lasted
two
thousand
years
with
many
pharaohs
like
khafra
of
the
fourth
dynasty
of
a
strongly
negroid
cast
of
countenance
at
the
end
of
the
period
the
empire
fell
apart
into
egyptian
and
ethiopian
halves
and
a
silence
of
three
centuries
ensued
it
is
quite
possible
that
an
incursion
of
conquering
black
men
from
the
south
poured
over
the
land
in
these
years
and
dotted
egypt
in
the
next
centuries
with
monuments
on
which
the
negro
type
is
strongly
and
triumphantly
impressed
the
great
sphinx
at
gizeh
so
familiar
to
all
the
world
the
sphinxes
of
tanis
the
statue
from
the
fayum
the
statue
of
the
esquiline
at
rome
and
the
colossi
of
bubastis
all
represent
black
negroes
and
are
described
by
petrie
as
having
high
cheek
bones
flat
cheeks
both
in
one
plane
a
massive
nose
firm
projecting
lips
and
thick
hair
with
an
austere
and
almost
savage
expression
of
power
blyden
the
great
modern
black
leader
of
west
africa
said
of
the
sphinx
at
gizeh
her
features
are
decidedly
of
the
african
or
negro
type
with
nostrils
if
then
the
sphinx
was
placed
here
looking
out
in
majestic
and
mysterious
silence
over
the
empty
plain
where
once
stood
the
great
city
of
memphis
in
all
its
pride
and
glory
as
an
representation
of
the
king
is
not
the
inference
clear
as
to
the
peculiar
type
or
race
to
which
that
king
belonged
the
middle
empire
arose
and
lasted
nearly
centuries
under
pharaohs
whose
negro
descent
is
plainly
evident
like
amenemhat
i
and
iii
and
usertesen
i
the
ancient
glories
of
egypt
were
restored
and
surpassed
at
the
same
time
there
is
strong
continuous
pressure
from
the
wild
and
unruly
negro
tribes
of
the
upper
nile
valley
and
we
get
some
idea
of
the
fear
which
they
inspired
throughout
egypt
when
we
read
of
the
great
national
rejoicing
which
followed
the
triumph
of
usertesen
iii
over
these
hordes
he
drove
them
back
and
attempted
to
confine
them
to
the
edge
of
the
nubian
desert
above
the
second
cataract
hemmed
in
here
they
set
up
a
state
about
this
time
and
founded
nepata
notwithstanding
this
repulse
of
black
men
less
than
one
hundred
years
later
a
negro
from
the
south
ra
nehesi
was
seated
on
the
throne
of
the
pharaohs
and
was
called
the
king
eldest
son
this
may
mean
that
an
incursion
from
the
far
south
had
placed
a
black
conqueror
on
the
throne
at
any
rate
the
whole
empire
was
in
some
way
shaken
and
two
hundred
years
later
the
invasion
of
the
hyksos
began
the
domination
of
hyksos
kings
who
may
have
been
negroids
from
asia
lasted
for
five
hundred
years
the
redemption
of
egypt
from
these
barbarians
came
from
upper
egypt
led
by
the
mulatto
aahmes
he
founded
in
the
new
empire
which
lasted
fifteen
hundred
years
his
queen
nefertari
the
most
venerated
figure
of
egyptian
history
was
a
negress
of
great
beauty
strong
personality
and
of
unusual
administrative
force
she
was
for
many
years
joint
ruler
with
her
son
amenhotep
i
who
succeeded
his
father
the
new
empire
was
a
period
of
foreign
conquest
and
internal
splendor
and
finally
of
religious
dispute
and
overthrow
syria
was
conquered
in
these
reigns
and
asiatic
civilization
and
influences
poured
in
upon
egypt
the
great
tahutmes
iii
whose
reign
was
one
of
the
grandest
and
most
eventful
in
egyptian
history
had
a
strong
negroid
countenance
as
had
also
queen
hatshepsut
who
sent
the
celebrated
expedition
to
reopen
ancient
trade
with
the
hottentots
of
punt
a
new
strain
of
negro
blood
came
to
the
royal
line
through
queen
mutemua
about
whose
son
amenhotep
iii
built
a
great
temple
at
luqsor
and
the
colossi
at
memnon
the
whole
of
the
period
in
a
sense
culminated
in
the
great
ramessu
ii
the
oppressor
of
the
hebrews
who
with
his
egyptian
libyan
and
negro
armies
fought
half
the
world
his
reign
however
was
the
beginning
of
decline
and
foes
began
to
press
egypt
from
the
white
north
and
the
black
south
the
priests
transferred
their
power
at
thebes
while
the
assyrians
under
nimrod
overran
lower
egypt
the
center
of
interest
is
now
transferred
to
ethiopia
and
we
pass
to
the
more
shadowy
history
of
that
land
the
most
perfect
example
of
egyptian
poetry
left
to
us
is
a
celebration
of
the
prowess
of
usertesen
iii
in
confining
the
turbulent
negro
tribes
to
the
territory
below
the
second
cataract
of
the
nile
the
egyptians
called
this
territory
kush
and
in
the
farthest
confines
of
kush
lay
punt
the
cradle
of
their
race
to
the
ancient
mediterranean
world
ethiopia
the
land
of
the
was
a
region
of
gods
and
fairies
zeus
and
poseidon
feasted
each
year
among
the
blameless
ethiopians
and
black
memnon
king
of
ethiopia
was
one
of
the
greatest
of
heroes
the
ethiopians
conceive
themselves
says
diodorus
siculus
lib
iii
to
be
of
greater
antiquity
than
any
other
nation
and
it
is
probable
that
born
under
the
sun
path
its
warmth
may
have
ripened
them
earlier
than
other
men
they
suppose
themselves
also
to
be
the
inventors
of
divine
worship
of
festivals
of
solemn
assemblies
of
sacrifices
and
every
religious
practice
they
affirm
that
the
egyptians
are
one
of
their
colonies
the
egyptians
themselves
in
later
days
affirmed
that
they
and
their
civilization
came
from
the
south
and
from
the
black
tribes
of
punt
and
certainly
at
the
earliest
period
in
which
human
remains
have
been
recovered
egypt
and
lower
nubia
appear
to
have
formed
culturally
and
racially
one
land
the
forging
ahead
of
egypt
in
culture
was
mainly
from
economic
causes
ethiopia
living
in
a
much
poorer
land
with
limited
agricultural
facilities
held
to
the
old
arts
and
customs
and
at
the
same
time
lost
the
best
elements
of
its
population
to
egypt
absorbing
meantime
the
oncoming
and
wilder
negro
tribes
from
the
south
and
west
under
the
old
empire
therefore
ethiopia
remained
in
comparative
poverty
except
as
some
of
its
tribes
invaded
egypt
with
their
handicrafts
as
soon
as
the
civilization
below
the
second
cataract
reached
a
height
noticeably
above
that
of
ethiopia
there
was
continued
effort
to
protect
that
civilization
against
the
incursion
of
barbarians
hundreds
of
campaigns
through
thousands
of
years
repeatedly
subdued
or
checked
the
blacks
and
brought
them
in
as
captives
to
mingle
their
blood
with
the
egyptian
nation
but
the
egyptian
frontier
was
not
advanced
a
separate
and
independent
ethiopian
culture
finally
began
to
arise
during
the
middle
empire
of
egypt
and
centered
at
nepata
and
meroe
widespread
trade
in
gold
ivory
precious
stones
skins
wood
and
works
of
handicraft
arose
the
negro
began
to
figure
as
the
great
trader
of
egypt
this
new
wealth
of
ethiopia
excited
the
cupidity
of
the
pharaohs
and
led
to
aggression
and
larger
intercourse
until
at
last
when
the
dread
hyksos
appeared
ethiopia
became
both
a
physical
and
cultural
refuge
for
conquered
egypt
the
legitimate
pharaohs
moved
to
thebes
nearer
the
boundaries
of
ethiopia
and
from
here
under
negroid
rulers
lower
egypt
was
redeemed
the
ensuing
new
empire
witnessed
the
gradual
incorporation
of
ethiopia
into
egypt
although
the
darker
kingdom
continued
to
resist
both
mulatto
pharaohs
aahmes
and
amenhotep
i
sent
expeditions
into
ethiopia
and
in
the
latter
day
sons
of
the
reigning
pharaoh
began
to
assume
the
title
of
royal
son
of
kush
in
some
such
way
as
the
son
of
the
king
of
england
becomes
the

trade
relations
were
renewed
with

under
circumstances
which
lead
us
to
place
that
land
in
the
region
of
the
african
lakes
the
sudanese
tribes
were
aroused
by
these
and
other
incursions
until
the
revolts
became
formidable
in
the
fourteenth
century
before

egyptian

however
gradually
conquered
ethiopia
where
her
armies
could
not

egyptian

tenth

theocratic
monarchy

the
ethiopian

expanded
north
about

for
a
century
ruled
all

the

not
noticeably
negroid

century
of

a

was
appointed
to
rule
egypt
just
as
formerly
a
royal
egyptian
had
ruled
kush
in
many
ways
this
ethiopian
kingdom
showed
its
negro
peculiarities
first
in
its
worship
of
distinctly
sudanese
gods
secondly
in
the
rigid
custom
of
female
succession
in
the
kingdom
and
thirdly
by
the
election
of
kings
from
the
various
royal
claimants
to
the
throne
it
was
the
heyday
of
the
negro
for
the
greater
part
of
the
century
egypt
itself
was
subject
to
the
blacks
just
as
in
the
new

the
sudan
had
been
subject
to

egypt
now
began
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
asia
and
was
conquered
first
by
the
assyrians
and
then
by

persians
but
the

kept
their
independence

he
also
removed
the

although
nepata
continued
to
be

the
ethiopian

were
still
crowned
on
its
golden
throne
from
the
fifth
to

find

king
ergamenes
showed
strong
greek
influences
and
at
the

time
began
to
employ
the

received
unusual
consideration
from

formidable
foe

an
evidently
fabulous
story
of
the
visit

nevertheless

her
fame
candace
will
not
let

enter
ethiopia

says
he
is
not
to
scorn
her
people
because
they
are
black

the
romans
continued
to

so
much
trouble
with
their
ethiopian
frontier
that
finally
when
semitic
mulattoes
appeared
in
the
east
the
emperor
diocletian
invited
the
wild
sudanese
tribe
of
nubians
nobadæ
from
the

to
repel
them
these
nubians

embraced

the
population
of
that
day
was
nomadic
in
the
fourth
century
byzantine
influences
began
to
be
felt
and
in
athanasius
of
alexandria
consecrated
fromentius
as
bishop
of
ethiopia
he
tutored
the
heir
to
the
abyssinian
kingdom
and
began
its
gradual
christianization
by
the
early
part
of
the
sixth
century
abyssinia
was
trading
with
india
and
byzantium
and
was
so
far
recognized
as
a
christian
country
that
the
emperor
justinian
appealed
to
king
kaleb
to
protect
the
christians
in
southwestern
arabia
kaleb
conquered
yemen
in
and
held
it
fifty
years
eventually
a
jewish
princess
judith
usurped
the
axumite
throne
the
abyssinians
were
expelled
from
arabia
and
a
long
period
begins
when
as
gibbon
says
encompassed
by
the
enemies
of
their
religion
the
ethiopians
slept
for
nearly
a
thousand
years
forgetful
of
the
world
by
whom
they
were
forgotten
throughout
the
middle
ages
however
the
legend
of
a
great
christian
kingdom
hidden
away
in
africa
persisted
and
the
search
for
prester
john
became
one
of
the
world
quests
it
was
the
expanding
power
of
abyssinia
that
led
rome
to
call
in
the
nubians
from
the
western
desert
the
nubians
had
formed
a
strong
league
of
tribes
and
as
the
ancient
kingdom
of
ethiopia
declined
they
drove
back
the
abyssinians
who
had
already
established
themselves
at
meroe
in
the
sixth
century
the
nubians
were
converted
to
christianity
by
a
byzantine
priest
and
they
immediately
began
to
develop
a
new
capital
dongola
replaced
nepata
and
meroe
and
by
the
twelfth
century
churches
and
brick
dwellings
had
appeared
as
the
mohammedan
flood
pressed
up
the
nile
valley
it
was
the
nubians
that
held
it
back
for
two
centuries
farther
south
other
wild
tribes
pushed
out
of
the
sudan
and
began
a
similar
development
chief
among
these
were
the
fung
who
fixed
their
capital
at
senaar
at
the
junction
of
the
white
and
blue
nile
when
the
mohammedan
flood
finally
passed
over
nubia
the
fung
diverted
it
by
declaring
themselves
moslems
this
left
the
fung
as
the
dominant
power
in
the
fifteenth
century
from
the
three
cataracts
to
fazogli
and
from
the
red
sea
at
suakin
to
the
white

islam
then
swept
on
south
in
a
great
circle
skirted
the
great
lakes
and
then
curled
back
to
somaliland
completely
isolating
abyssinia
between
the
thirteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
the
egyptian
sudan
became
a
congeries
of
mohammedan
kingdoms
with
arab

and
negro

arose
in
the

east
of

nearer

lay
the

a
nubian
nation
whose

reigned
over
two
hundred
years
and
which
reached
great
prosperity
in
the
early
seventeenth
century
under
soliman
solon
before
the
mohammedan
power
reached
abyssinia
the
portuguese
pioneers
had
entered
the
country
from
the
east
and
begun
to
open
the
country
again
to
european
knowledge
without
doubt
in
the
centuries
of
silence
a
civilization
of
some
height
had
flourished
in
abyssinia
but
all
authentic
records
were
destroyed
by
fire
in
the
tenth
century
when
the
portuguese
came
the
older
axumite
kingdom
had
fallen
and
had
been
succeeded
by
a
number
of
petty
states
the
sudanese
kingdoms
of
the
sudan
resisted
the
power
of
the
mameluke
beys
in
egypt
and
later
the
power
of
the
turks
until
the
nineteenth
century
when
the
sudan
was
made
nominally
a
part
of
egypt
continuous
upheaval
war
and
conquest
had
by
this
time
done
their
work
and
little
of
ancient
ethiopian
culture
survived
except
the
slave
trade
the
entrance
of
england
into
egypt
after
the
building
of
the
suez
canal
stirred
up
eventually
revolt
in
the
sudan
for
political
economic
and
religious
reasons
led
by
a
sudanese
negro
mohammed
ahmad
who
claimed
to
be
the
messiah
mahdi
the
sudan
arose
in
revolt
in
determined
to
resist
a
hated
religion
foreign
rule
and
interference
with
their
chief
commerce
the
trade
in
slaves
the
sudan
was
soon
aflame
and
the
able
mulatto
general
osman
digna
aided
by
revolt
among
the
heathen
dinka
drove
egypt
and
england
out
of
the
sudan
for
sixteen
years
it
was
not
until
that
england
reëntered
the
sudan
and
in
petty
revenge
desecrated
the
bones
of
the
brave
even
if
misguided
prophet
meantime
this
mahdist
revolt
had
delayed
england
designs
on
abyssinia
and
the
italians
replacing
her
attempted
a

menelik
of

one
of

and
had
been
induced
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
italians
after
king
john
had
been
killed
by
the
mahdists
the
exact
terms
of
the
treaty
were
disputed
but
undoubtedly
the
italians
tried
by
this
means
to
reduce
menelik
to
vassalage
menelik
stoutly
resisted
and
at
the
great
battle
of

one
of

the

inflicted

land
of

was
applied
to
the
whole
region
south
of
the

from

to

it
is
a
territory
some
hundred
miles
by
six
hundred
miles
containing
two
million
square
miles
and
has
a
population
of
perhaps
eighty
million
it
is
thus
the
size
of
the
united
states
and
quite
as
thickly
settled
in
the
western
sudan
the
niger
plays
the
same
role
as
the
nile
in
the
east
in
this
chapter
we
follow
the
history
of
the
niger
the
history
of
this
part
of
africa
was
probably
something
as
follows
primitive
man
entering
africa
from
arabia
found
the
great
lakes
spread
in
the
nile
valley
and
wandered
westward
to
the
niger
herodotus
tells
of
certain
youths
who
penetrated
the
desert
to
the
niger
and
found
there
a
city
of
black
dwarfs
succeeding
migrations
of
negroes
and
negroids
pushed
the
dwarfs
gradually
into
the
inhospitable
forests
and
occupied
the
sudan
pushing
on
to
the
atlantic
here
the
newcomers
curling
northward
met
the
mediterranean
race
coming
down
across
the
western
desert
while
to
the
southward
the
negro
came
to
the
gulf
of
guinea
and
the
thick
forests
of
the
congo
valley
indigenous
civilizations
arose
on
the
west
coast
in
yoruba
and
benin
and
contact
of
these
with
the
mediterranean
race
in
the
desert
and
with
egyptian
and
arab
from
the
east
gave
rise
to
centers
of
negro
culture
in
the
sudan
at
ghana
and
melle
and
in
songhay
nupe
the
hausa
states
and
bornu
the
history
of
the
sudan
thus
leads
us
back
again
to
ethiopia
that
strange
and
ancient
center
of
world
civilization
whose
inhabitants
in
the
ancient
world
were
considered
to
be
the
most
pious
and
the
oldest
of
men
from
this
center
the
black
originators
of
african
culture
and
to
a
large
degree
of
world
culture
wandered
not
simply
down
the
nile
but
also
westward
these
negroes
developed
the
original
substratum
of
culture
which
later
influences
modified
but
never
displaced
we
know
that
egyptian
pharaohs
in
several
cases
ventured
into
the
western
sudan
and
that
egyptian
influences
are
distinctly
traceable
greek
and
byzantine
culture
and
phoenician
and
carthaginian
trade
also
penetrated
while
islam
finally
made
this
whole
land
her
own
behind
all
these
influences
however
stood
from
the
first
an
indigenous
negro
culture
the
stone
figures
of
sherbro
the
megaliths
of
gambia
the
art
and
industry
of
the
west
coast
are
all
too
deep
and
original
evidences
of
civilization
to
be
merely
importations
from
abroad
nor
was
the
sudan
the
inert
recipient
of
foreign
influence
when
it
came
according
to
credible
legend
the
great
king
at
byzantium
imported
glass
tin
silver
bronze
cut
stones
and
other
treasure
from
the
sudan
embassies
were
sent
and
states
like
nupe
recognized
the
suzerainty
of
the
byzantine
emperor
the
people
of
nupe
especially
were
filled
with
pride
when
the
byzantine
people
learned
certain
kinds
of
work
in
bronze
and
glass
from
them
and
this
intercourse
was
only
interrupted
by
the
mohammedan
conquest
to
this
ancient
culture
modified
somewhat
by
byzantine
and
christian
influences
came
islam
it
approached
from
the
northwest
coming
stealthily
and
slowly
and
being
handed
on
particularly
by
the
mandingo
negroes
about
the
situation
was
this
ghana
was
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
in
the
north
mandingoland
between
the
niger
and
the
senegal
in
the
south
and
the
western
sahara
djolof
was
in
the
west
on
the
senegal
and
the
songhay
on
the
niger
in
the
center
the
mohammedans
came
chiefly
as
traders
and
found
a
trade
already
established
here
and
there
in
the
great
cities
were
districts
set
aside
for
these
new
merchants
and
the
mohammedans
gave
frequent
evidence
of
their
respect
for
these
black
nations
islam
did
not
found
new
states
but
modified
and
united
negro
states
already
ancient
it
did
not
initiate
new
commerce
but
developed
a
widespread
trade
already
established
it
is
as
frobenius
says
easily
proved
from
chronicles
written
in
arabic
that
islam
was
only
effective
in
fact
as
a
fertilizer
and
stimulant
the
essential
point
is
the
resuscitative
and
invigorative
concentration
of
negro
power
in
the
service
of
a
new
era
and
a
moslem
propaganda
as
well
as
the
reaction
thereby
produced
early
in
the
eighth
century
islam
had
conquered
north
africa
and
converted
the
berbers
aided
by
black
soldiers
the
moslems
crossed
into
spain
in
the
following
century
berber
and
arab
armies
crossed
the
west
end
of
the
sahara
and
came
to
negroland
later
in
the
eleventh
century
arabs
penetrated
the
sudan
and
central
africa
from
the
east
filtering
through
the
negro
tribes
of
darfur
kanem
and
neighboring
regions
the
arabs
were
too
nearly
akin
to
negroes
to
draw
an
absolute
color
line
antar
one
of
the
great
poets
of
arabia
was
the
son
of
a
black
woman
and
one
of
the
great
poets
at
the
court
of
haroun
al
raschid
was
black
in
the
twelfth
century
a
learned
negro
poet
resided
at
seville
and
sidjilmessa
the
last
town
in
lower
morocco
toward
the
desert
was
founded
in
by
a
negro
who
ruled
over
the
berber
inhabitants
indeed
many
towns
in
the
sudan
and
the
desert
were
thus
ruled
and
felt
no
incongruity
in
this
arrangement
they
say
to
be
sure
that
the
moors
destroyed
audhoghast
because
it
paid
tribute
to
the
black
town
of
ghana
but
this
was
because
the
town
was
heathen
and
not
because
it
was
black
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
story
that
a
berber
king
overthrew
one
of
the
cities
of
the
sudan
and
all
the
black
women
committed
suicide
being
too
proud
to
allow
themselves
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
white
men
in
the
west
the
moslems
first
came
into
touch
with
the
negro
kingdom
of
ghana
here
large
quantities
of
gold
were
gathered
in
early
days
and
we
have
names
of
rulers
before
running
through
generations
this
would
take
us
back
approximately
a
thousand
years
to
or
about
the
time
that
pharaoh
necho
of
egypt
sent
out
the
phoenician
expedition
which
circumnavigated
africa
and
possibly
before
the
time
when
hanno
the
carthaginian
explored
the
west
coast
of
africa
by
the
middle
of
the
eleventh
century
ghana
was
the
principal
kingdom
in
the
western
sudan
already
the
town
had
a
native
and
a
mussulman
quarter
and
was
built
of
wood
and
stone
with
surrounding
gardens
the
king
had
an
army
of
two
hundred
thousand
and
the
wealth
of
the
country
was
great
a
century
later
the
king
had
become
mohammedan
in
faith
and
had
a
palace
with
sculptures
and
glass
windows
the
great
reason
for
this
development
was
the
desert
trade
gold
skins
ivory
kola
nuts
gums
honey
wheat
and
cotton
were
exported
and
the
whole
mediterranean
coast
traded
in
the
sudan
other
and
lesser
black
kingdoms
like
tekrou
silla
and
masina
surrounded
ghana
in
the
early
part
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
prestige
of
ghana
began
to
fall
before
the
rising
mandingan
kingdom
to
the
west
melle
as
it
was
called
was
founded
in
and
formed
an
open
door
for
moslem
and
moorish
traders
the
new
kingdom
helped
by
its
expanding
trade
began
to
grow
and
islam
slowly
surrounded
the
older
negro
culture
west
north
and
east
however
a
great
mass
of
the
older
heathen
culture
pushing
itself
upward
from
the
guinea
coast
stood
firmly
against
islam
down
to
the
nineteenth
century
steadily
mohammedanism
triumphed
in
the
growing
states
which
almost
encircled
the
protagonists
of
ancient
atlantic
culture
mandingan
melle
eventually
supplanted
ghana
in
prestige
and
power
after
ghana
had
been
overthrown
by
the
heathen
su

from
the

the
territory
of

lay
southeast
of

and
some
five
hundred

north
of

its
kings
were
known
by
the
title
of

from
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth

to

middle
of
the
fourteenth
the
mellestine

its
dominion
was
called

the
leading

in

its
greatest

caravan
of
sixty
thousand

took
eighty

to

expenses
and
greatly
impressed
the
people
of

with
his
magnificence
on
his
return
he
found
that
timbuktu
had
been
sacked
by

he
rebuilt

mansa
musa
reigned
years
and
was
distinguished
by
his
ability
and
by
the
holiness
of
his
life
the
justice
of
his
administration
was
such
that
the
memory
of
it
still
lives
the
mellestine
preserved
its
preëminence
until
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
when
the
rod
of
sudanese
empire
passed
to
songhay
the
largest
and
most
famous
of
the
black
empires
the
known
history
of
songhay
covers
a
thousand
years
and
three
dynasties
and
centers
in
the
great
bend
of
the
niger
there
were
thirty
kings
of
the
first
dynasty
reigning
from
to
during
the
reign
of
one
of
these
the
songhay
kingdom
became
the
vassal
kingdom
of
melle
then
at
the
height
of
its
glory
in
addition
to
this
the
mossi
crossed
the
valley
plundered
timbuktu
in
and
separated

the
original
seat
of

from
the
main
empire
the
sixteenth
king
was
converted
to
mohammedanism
in
and
after
that
all
the
songhay
princes
were
mohammedans
mansa
musa
took
two
young
songhay
princes
to
the
court
of
melle
to
be
educated
in
these
boys
when
grown
ran
away
and
founded
a
new
dynasty
in

in
seventeen
of
these
kings
reigned
the

greatest
being
sonni
ali
who
ascended
the
throne
in
melle
was
at
this
time
declining
other
cities
like
jenne
with
its
seven
thousand
villages
were
rising
and
the
tuaregs
berbers
with
negro
blood
had
captured

sonni
ali
was
a
soldier
and
began
his
career
with
the
conquest
of
timbuktu
in
he
also
succeeded
in
capturing
jenne
and
attacked
the
mossi
and
other
enemies
on
all
sides
finally
he
concentrated
his
forces
for
the
destruction
of
melle
and
subdued
nearly
the
whole
empire
on
the
west
bend
of
the
niger
in
summing
up
sonni
ali
military
career
the
chronicle
says
of
him
he
surpassed
all
his
predecessors
in
the
numbers
and
valor
of
his
soldiery
his
conquests
were
many
and
his
renown
extended
from
the
rising
to
the
setting
of
the
sun
if
it
is
the
will
of
god
he
will
be
long
spoken
of
sonni
ali
was
a
songhay
negro
whose
father
was
a
berber
he
was
succeeded
by
a
black
mohammed
abou
bekr
who
had
been
his
prime
minister
mohammed
was
hailed
as
askia
usurper
and
is
best
known
as
mohammed
askia
he
was
strictly
orthodox
where
ali
was
rather
a
scoffer
and
an
organizer
where
ali
was
a
warrior
on
his
pilgrimage
to
mecca
in
there
was
nothing
of
the
barbaric
splendor
of
mansa
musa
but
a
brilliant
group
of
scholars
and
holy
men
with
a
small
escort
of
fifteen
hundred
soldiers
and
nine
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
gold
he
stopped
and
consulted
with
scholars
and
politicians
and
studied
matters
of
taxation
weights
and
measures
trade
religious
tolerance
and
manners
in
cairo
where
he
was
invested
by
the
reigning
caliph
of
egypt
he
may
have
heard
of
the
struggle
of
europe
for
the
trade
of
the
indies
and
perhaps
of
the
parceling
of
the
new
world
between
portugal
and
spain
he
returned
to
the
sudan
in
instituted
a
standing
army
of
slaves
undertook
a
holy
war
against
the
indomitable
mossi
and
finally
marched
against
the
hausa
he
subdued
these
cities
and
even
imposed
the
rule
of
black
men
on
the
berber
town
of
agades
a
rich
city
of
merchants
and
artificers
with
stately
mansions
in
fine
askia
during
his
reign
conquered
and
consolidated
an
empire
two
thousand
miles
long
by
one
thousand
wide
at
its
greatest
diameters
a
territory
as
large
as
all
europe
the
territory
was
divided
into
four
vice
royalties
and
the
system
of
melle
with
its
native
dynasties
was
carried
out
his
empire
extended
from
the
atlantic
to
lake
chad
and
from
the
salt
mines
of
tegazza
and
the
town
of
augila
in
the

to
the
degree
of
north
latitude
toward
the
south
it
was
a
six
months
journey
across
the
empire
and
it
is
said
he
was
obeyed
with
as
much
docility
on
the
farthest
limits
of
the
empire
as
he
was
in
his
own
palace
and
there
reigned
everywhere
great
plenty
and
absolute
peace
the
university
of
sankore
became
a
center
of
learning
in
correspondence
with
egypt
and
north
africa
and
had
a
swarm
of
black
sudanese
students
law
literature

were
studied

the
great

years
and
his
dynasty
continued
on
the
throne
until
after
the
moorish
conquest
in
meanwhile
to
the
eastward
two
powerful
states
appeared
they
never
disputed
the
military
supremacy
of
songhay
but
their
industrial
development
was
marvelous
the
hausa
states
were
formed
by
seven
original
cities
of
which
kano
was
the
oldest
and
katsena
the
most
famous
their
greatest
leaders
mohammed
rimpa
and
ahmadu
kesoke
arose
in
the
fifteenth
and
early
sixteenth
centuries
the
land
was
subject
to
the
songhay
but
the
cities
became
industrious
centers
of
smelting
weaving
and
dyeing
katsena
especially
in
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
is
described
as
a
place
thirteen
or
fourteen
miles
in
circumference
divided
into
quarters
for
strangers
for
visitors
from
various
other
states
and
for
the
different
trades
and
industries
as
saddlers
shoemakers
dyers
etc
beyond
the
hausa
states
and
bordering
on
lake
chad
was
bornu
the
people
of
bornu
had
a
large
infiltration
of
berber
blood
but
were
predominantly
negro
berber
mulattoes
had
been
kings
in
early
days
but
they
were
soon
replaced
by
black
men
under
the
early
kings
who
can
be
traced
back
to
the
third
century
these
people
had
ruled
nearly
all
the
territory
between
the
nile
and
lake
chad
the
country
was
known
as
kanem
and
the
pagan
dynasty
of
dugu
reigned
there
from
the
middle
of
the
ninth
to
the
end
of
the
eleventh
century
mohammedanism
was
introduced
from
egypt
at
the
end
of
the
eleventh
century
and
under
the
mohammedan
kings
kanem
became
one
of
the
first
powers
of
the
sudan
by
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
the
armies
of
kanem
were
very
powerful
and
its
rulers
were
known
as
kings
of
kanem
and
lords
of
bornu
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
kings
even
dared
to
invade
the
southern
country
down
toward
the
valley
of
the
congo
meantime
great
things
were
happening
in
the
world
beyond
the
desert
the
ocean
and
the
nile
arabian
mohammedanism
had
succumbed
to
the
wild
fanaticism
of
the
seljukian
turks
these
new
conquerors
were
not
only
firmly
planted
at
the
gates
of
vienna
but
had
swept
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
and
sent
all
europe
scouring
the
seas
for
their
lost
trade
connections
with
the
riches
of
india
religious
zeal
fear
of
conquest
and
commercial
greed
inflamed
europe
against
the
mohammedan
and
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
new
world
the
riches
of
which
poured
first
on
spain
oppression
of
the
moors
followed
and
in
they
were
driven
back
into
africa
despoiled
and
humbled
here
the
spaniards
followed
and
harassed
them
and
here
the
turks
fighting
the
christians
captured
the
mediterranean
ports
and
cut
the
moors
off
permanently
from
europe
in
the
slow
years
that
followed
huddled
in
northwest
africa
they
became
a
decadent
people
and
finally
cast
their
eyes
toward
negroland
the
moors
in
morocco
had
come
to
look
upon
the
sudan
as
a
gold
mine
and
knew
that
the
sudan
was
especially
dependent
upon
salt
in
morocco
claimed
the
principal
salt
mines
at
tegazza
but
the
reigning
askia
refused
to
recognize
the
claim
when
the
sultan
elmansour
came
to
the
throne
of
morocco
he
increased
the
efficiency
of
his
army
by
supplying
it
with
fire
arms
and
cannon
elmansour
determined
to
attack
the
sudan
and
sent
four
hundred
men
under
pasha
djouder
who
left
morocco
in
the
songhay
with
their
bows
and
arrows
were
helpless
against
powder
and
shot
and
they
were
defeated
at
tenkadibou
april
askia
ishak
the
king
offered
terms
and
djouder
pasha
referred
them
to
morocco
the
sultan
angry
with
his
general
delay
deposed
him
and
sent
another
who
crushed
and
treacherously
murdered
the
king
and
set
up
a
puppet
thereafter
there
were
two
askias
one
under
the
moors
at
timbuktu
and
one
who
maintained
himself
in
the
hausa
states
which
the
moors
could
not
subdue
anarchy
reigned
in
songhay
the
moors
tried
to
put
down
disorder
with
a
high
hand
drove
out
and
murdered
the
distinguished
men
of
timbuktu
and
as
a
result
let
loose
a
riot
of
robbery
and
decadence
throughout
the
sudan
pasha
now
succeeded
pasha
with
revolt
and
misrule
until
in
the
soldiers
elected
their
own
pasha
and
deliberately
shut
themselves
up
in
the
sudan
by
cutting
off
approach
from
the
north
hausaland
and
bornu
were
still
open
to
turkish
and
mohammedan
influence
from
the
east
and
the
gulf
of
guinea
to
the
slave
trade
from
the
south
but
the
face
of
the
finest
negro
civilization
the
modern
world
had
ever
produced
was
veiled
from
europe
and
given
to
the
defilement
of
wild
moorish
soldiers
in
it
is
written
excesses
of
every
kind
are
now
committed
unchecked
by
the
soldiery
and
the
country
is
profoundly
convulsed
and
oppressed
the
tuaregs
marched
down
from
the
desert
and
deprived
the
moors
of
many
of
the
principal
towns
the
rest
of
the
empire
of
the
songhay
was
by
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
divided
among
separate
moorish
chiefs
who
bought
supplies
from
the
negro
peasantry
and
were
at
once
the
vainest
proudest
and
perhaps
the
most
bigoted
ferocious
and
intolerant
of
all
the
nations
of
the
south
they
lived
a
nomadic
life
plundering
the
negroes
to
such
depths
did
the
mighty
songhay
fall
as
the
songhay
declined
a
new
power
arose
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
fula
the
fula
who
vary
in
race
from
berber
mulattoes
to
negroes
may
be
the
result
of
a
westward
migration
of
some
people
like
the
leukoæthiopi
of
pliny
or
they
may
have
arisen
from
the
migration
of
berber
mulattoes
in
the
western
oases
driven
south
by
romans
and
arabs
these
wandering
herdsmen
lived
on
the
senegal
river
and
the
ocean
in
very
early
times
and
were
not
heard
of
until
the
nineteenth
century
by
this
time
they
had
changed
to
a
negro
or
dark
mulatto
people
and
lived
scattered
in
small
communities
between
the
atlantic
and
darfur
they
were
without
political
union
or
national
sentiment
but
were
all
mohammedans
then
came
a
sudden
change
and
led
by
a
religious
fanatic
these
despised
and
persecuted
people
became
masters
of
the
central
sudan
they
were
the
ones
who
at
last
broke
down
that
great
wedge
of
resisting
atlantic
culture
after
it
had
been
undermined
and
disintegrated
by
the
american
slave
trade
thus
islam
finally
triumphed
in
the
sudan
and
the
ancient
culture
combined
with
the
new
in
the
sudan
one
may
find
evidences
of
the
union
of
two
classes
of
people
the
representatives
of
the
older
civilization
dwell
as
peasants
in
small
communities
carrying
on
industries
and
speaking
a
large
number
of
different
languages
with
them
or
above
them
is
the
ruling
mohammedan
caste
speaking
four
main
languages
mandingo
hausa
fula
and
arabic
these
latter
form
the
state
builders
negro
blood
predominates
among
both
classes
but
naturally
there
is
more
berber
blood
among
the
mohammedan
invaders
europe
during
the
middle
ages
had
some
knowledge
of
these
movements
in
the
sudan
and
africa
melle
and
songhay
appear
on
medieval
maps
in
literature
we
have
many
allusions
the
mulatto
king
feirifis
was
one
of
wolfram
von
eschenbach
heroes
prester
john
furnished
endless
lore
othello
the
warrior
and
the
black
king
represented
by
medieval
art
as
among
the
three
wise
men
and
the
various
black
virgin
marys
all
show
legendary
knowledge
of
what
african
civilization
was
at
that
time
doing
it
is
a
curious
commentary
on
modern
prejudice
that
most
of
this
splendid
history
of
civilization
and
uplift
is
unknown
and
men
confidently
assert
that
negroes
have
no
history

one
of
the
great
cities
of
the

was
jenne
the
chronicle
says
that
its
markets
are
held
every
day
of
the

and
its
populations
are
very
enormous
its
seven
thousand
villages
are
so

that

of

has
no

of

if
he
wishes
to
send
a

to
lake
dibo
for
instance
it
is
cried
from
the
gate
of
the
town
and
repeated
from
village
to
village
by
which
means
it
reaches
its
destination
almost
instantly
from
the
name
of
this
city
we
get
the
modern
name
guinea
which
is
used
to
designate
the
country
contiguous
to
the
great
gulf
of
that
name
a
territory
often
referred
to
in
general
as
west
africa
here
reaching
from
the
mouth
of
the
gambia
to
the
mouth
of
the
niger
is
a
coast
of
six
hundred
miles
where
a
marvelous
drama
of
world
history
has
been
enacted
the
coast
and
its
hinterland
comprehends
many
names
first
comes
ancient
guinea
then
modern
sierra
leone
and
liberia
then
follow
the
various
coasts
of
ancient
traffic
the
grain
ivory
gold
and
slave
coasts
with
the
adjoining
territories
of
ashanti
dahomey
lagos
and
benin
and
farther
back
such
tribal
and
territorial
names
as
those
of
the
mandingoes
yorubas
the
mossi
nupe
borgu
and
others
recent
investigation
makes
it
certain
that
an
ancient
civilization
existed
on
this
coast
which
may
have
gone
back
as
far
as
three
thousand
years
before
christ
frobenius
perhaps
fancifully
identified
this
african
coast
with
the
atlantis
of
the
greeks
and
as
part
of
that
great
western
movement
in
human
culture
beyond
the
pillars
of
hercules
which
thirteen
centuries
before
christ
strove
with
egypt
and
the
east
it
is
at
any
rate
clear
that
ancient
commerce
reached
down
the
west
coast
the
phoenicians
and
the
carthaginians
a
century
or
more
later
record
voyages
and
these
may
have
been
attempted
revivals
of
still
more
ancient
intercourse
these
coasts
at
some
unknown
prehistoric
period
were
peopled
from
the
niger
plateau
toward
the
north
and
west
by
the
black
west
african
type
of
negro
while
along
the
west
end
of
the
desert
these
negroes
mingled
with
the
berbers
forming
various
negroid
races
movement
and
migration
is
evident
along
this
coast
in
ancient
and
modern
times
the
peoples
were
among
the
earliest
arrivals
with
their
remarkable
art
and
industry
which
places
them
in
some
lines
of
technique
abreast
with
the
modern
world
behind
them
came
the
mossi
from
the
north
and
many
other
peoples
in
recent
days
have
filtered
through
like
the
limba
and
temni
of
sierra
leone
and
the
who
moved
from
borgu
some
two
thousand
years
ago
to
the
gold
and
ivory
coasts
we
have
already
noted
in
the
main
the
history
of
black
men
along
the
wonderful
niger
and
seen
how
pushing
up
from
the
gulf
of
guinea
a
powerful
wedge
of
ancient
culture
held
back
islam
for
a
thousand
years
now
victorious
now
stubbornly
disputing
every
inch
of
retreat
the
center
of
this
culture
lay
probably
in
oldest
times
above
the
bight
of
benin
along
the
slave
coast
and
reached
east
west
and
north
we
trace
it
not
only
in
the
remarkable
tradition
of
the
natives
but
in
stone
monuments
architecture
industrial
and
social
organization
and
works
of
art
in
bronze
glass
and
terra
cotta
benin
art
has
been
practiced
without
interruption
for
centuries
and
von
luschan
says
that
it
is
of
extraordinary
significance
that
by
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
a
local
and
monumental
art
had
been
learned
in
benin
which
in
many
respects
equaled
european
art
and
developed
a
technique
of
the
very
highest
accomplishment
summing
up
yoruban
civilization
frobenius
concluded
that
the
technical
summit
of
that
civilization
was
reached
in
the
industry
and
that
the
most
important
achievements
in
art
were
not
expressed
in
stone
but
in
fine
clay
baked
in
the
furnace
that
hollow
casting
was
thoroughly
known
too
and
practiced
by
these
people
that
iron
was
mainly
used
for
decoration
that
whatever
their
purpose
they
kept
their
glass
beads
in
stoneware
urns
within
their
own
locality
and
that
they
manufactured
both
earthen
and
glass
ware
that
the
art
of
weaving
was
highly
developed
among
them
that
the
stone
monuments
it
is
true
show
some
dexterity
in
handling
and
are
so
far
instructive
but
in
other
respects
evidence
a
cultural
condition
insufficiently
matured
to
grasp
the
utility
of
stone
monumental
material
and
above
all
that
the
then
great
and
significant
idea
of
the
universe
as
imaged
in
the
templum
was
current
in
those
days
effort
has
naturally
been
made
to
ascribe
this
civilization
to
white
people
first
it
was
ascribed
to
portuguese
influence
but
much
of
it
is
evidently
older
than
the
portuguese
discovery
egypt
and
india
have
been
evoked
and
greece
and
carthage
but
all
these
explanations
are
if
ever
a
people
exhibited
unanswerable
evidence
of
indigenous
civilization
it
is
the
africans
undoubtedly
they
adapted
much
that
came
to
them
utilized
new
ideas
and
grew
from
contact
but
their
art
and
culture
is
negro
through
and
through
yoruba
forms
one
of
the
three
city
groups
of
west
africa
another
is
around
timbuktu
and
a
third
in
the
hausa
states
the
timbuktu
cities
have
from
five
to
fifteen
hundred
towns
while
the
yoruba
cities
have
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
inhabitants
and
more
the
hausa
cities
are
many
of
them
important
but
few
are
as
large
as
the
yoruba
cities
and
they
lie
farther
apart
ah
three
centers
however
are
connected
with
the
niger
and
the
group
nearest
the
coast
that
is
the
yoruba
cities
has
the
greatest
numbers
of
towns
the
most
developed
architectural
styles
and
the
oldest
institutions
the
yoruba
cities
are
not
only
different
from
the
sudanese
in
population
but
in
their
social
relations
the
sudanese
cities
were
influenced
from
the
desert
and
the
mediterranean
and
form
nuclei
of
larger
surrounding
monarchial
states
the
yoruba
cities
on
the
other
hand
remained
comparatively
autonomous
organizations
down
to
modern
times
and
their
relative
importance
changed
from
time
to
time
without
developing
an
imperialistic
idea
or
subordinating
the
group
to
one
overpowering
city
this
social
and
industrial
state
of
the
yorubas
formerly
spread
and
wielded
great
influence
we
find
yoruba
reaching
out
and
subduing
states
like
nupe
toward
the
northward
but
the
industrial
democracy
and
city
autonomy
of
yoruba
lent
itself
indifferently
to
conquest
and
the
state
fell
eventually
a
victim
to
the
fanatical
fula
mohammedans
and
was
made
a
part
of
the
modern
sultanate
of
gando
west
of
yoruba
on
the
lower
courses
of
the
niger
is
benin
an
ancient
state
which
in
traced
its
kings
back
one
thousand
years
some
legends
even
named
a
line
of
sixty
kings
it
seems
probable
that
benin
developed
the
imperial
idea
and
once
extended
its
rule
into
the
congo
valley
later
and
also
to
the
west
of
the
yoruba
come
two
states
showing
a
fiercer
and
ruder
culture
dahomey
and
ashanti
the
state
of
dahomey
was
founded
by
tacondomi
early
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
developed
into
a
fierce
and
bloody
tyranny
with
wholesale
murder
the
king
had
a
body
of
two
thousand
to
five
thousand
amazons
renowned
for
their
bravery
and
armed
with
rifles
the
kingdom
was
overthrown
by
the
french
in
under
sai
tutu
ashanti
arose
to
power
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
military
aristocracy
with
cruel
blood
sacrifices
was
formed
by
the
king
had
at
his
disposal
two
hundred
thousand
soldiers
the
ashanti
power
was
crushed
by
the
english
in
the
war
of
in
these
states
and
in
later
years
in
benin
the
whole
character
of
culture
seems
to
change
in
place
of
the
yoruban
culture
with
its
city
democracy
its
elevated
religious
ideas
its
finely
organized
industry
and
its
noble
art
came
ashanti
and
dahomey
what
was
it
that
changed
the
character
of
the
west
coast
from
this
to
the
orgies
of
war
and
blood
sacrifice
which
we
read
of
later
in
these
lands
there
can
be
but
one
answer
the
slave
trade
not
simply
the
sale
of
men
but
an
organized
traffic
of
such
proportions
and
widely
organized
ramifications
as
to
turn
the
attention
and
energies
of
men
from
nearly
all
other
industries
encourage
war
and
all
the
cruelest
passions
of
war
and
concentrate
this
traffic
in
precisely
that
part
of
africa
farthest
from
the
ancient
mediterranean
lines
of
trade
we
need
not
assume
that
the
cultural
change
was
sudden
or
absolute
ancient
yoruba
had
the
cruelty
of
a
land
but
it
was
not
dominant
or
tyrannical
modern
benin
and
dahomey
showed
traces
of
skill
culture
and
industry
along
with
inexplicable
cruelty
and
bloodthirstiness
but
it
was
the
slave
trade
that
turned
the
balance
and
set
these
lands
backward
dahomey
was
the
last
word
in
a
series
of
human
disasters
which
began
with
the
defeat
of
the
askias
at
tenkadibou
from
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
to
the
last
half
of
the
nineteenth
centuries
the
american
slave
trade
centered
in
guinea
and
devastated
the
coast
morally
socially
and
physically
european
rum
and
fire
arms
were
traded
for
human
beings
and
it
was
not
until
that
any
measures
were
taken
to
counteract
this
terrible
scourge
in
that
year
the
idea
arose
of
repatriating
stolen
negroes
on
that
coast
and
establishing
civilized
centers
to
supplant
the
slave
trade
about
four
hundred
negroes
from
england
were
sent
to
sierra
leone
to
whom
the
promoters
considerately
added
sixty
white
prostitutes
as
wives
the
climate
on
the
low
coast
however
was
so
deadly
that
new
recruits
were
soon
needed
an
american
negro
thomas
peters
who
had
served
as
sergeant
under
sir
henry
clinton
in
the
british
army
in
america
went
to
england
seeking
an
allotment
of
land
for
his
fellows
the
sierra
leone
company
welcomed
him
and
offered
free
passage
and
land
in
sierra
leone
to
the
negroes
of
nova
scotia
as
a
result
fifteen
vessels
sailed
with
eleven
hundred
and
ninety
negroes
in
arriving
in
africa
they
found
the
chief
white
man
in
control
there
so
drunk
that
he
soon
died
of
delirium
tremens
john
clarkson
however
brother
of
thomas
clarkson
the
abolitionist
eventually
took
the
lead
founded
freetown
and
the
colony
began
its
checkered
career
in
the
colony
was
saved
from
insurrection
by
the
exiled
maroon
negroes
from
jamaica
after
when
emancipation
in
english
colonies
took
place
severer
measures
against
the
slave
trade
was
possible
and
the
colony
began
to
grow
its
imports
and
exports
amount
to
fifteen
million
dollars
a
year
liberia
was
a
similar
american
experiment
in
american
philanthropists
decided
that
slavery
was
bound
to
die
out
but
that
the
problem
lay
in
getting
rid
of
the
freed
negroes
of
which
there
were
then
two
hundred
thousand
in
the
united
states
accordingly
the
american
colonization
society
was
proposed
this
year
and
founded
january
with
bushrod
washington
as
president
it
was
first
thought
to
encourage
migration
to
sierra
leone
and
negroes
were
sent
but
they
were
not
welcomed
as
a
result
territory
was
bought
in
the
present
confines
of
liberia
december
and
colonists
began
to
arrive
a
little
later
an
african
depot
for
recaptured
slaves
taken
in
the
contraband
slave
trade
provided
for
in
the
act
of
was
established
and
an
agent
was
sent
to
africa
to
form
a
settlement
gradually
this
settlement
was
merged
with
the
settlement
of
the
colonization
society
and
from
this
union
liberia
was
finally
evolved
the
last
white
governor
of
liberia
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
the
first
colored
governor
joseph
roberts
a
virginian
the
total
population
in
was
about
hundred
and
ninety
and
with
this
as
a
beginning
in
governor
roberts
declared
the
independence
of
the
state
the
recognition
of
liberian
independence
by
all
countries
except
the
united
states
followed
in
the
united
states
not
wishing
to
receive
a
negro
minister
did
not
recognize
liberia
until
no
sooner
was
the
independence
of
liberia
announced
than
england
and
france
began
a
long
series
of
aggressions
to
limit
her
territory
and
sovereignty
considerable
territory
was
lost
by
treaty
and
in
the
effort
to
get
capital
to
develop
the
rest
liberia
was
saddled
with
a
debt
of
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
which
she
received
less
than
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
actual
cash
finally
the
liberians
turned
to
the
united
states
for
capital
and
protection
as
a
result
the
liberian
customs
have
been
put
under
international
control
and
major
charles
young
the
ranking
negro
officer
in
the
united
states
army
with
several
colored
assistants
has
been
put
in
charge
of
the
making
of
roads
and
drilling
a
constabulary
to
keep
order
in
the
interior
liberia
has
an
area
of
forty
thousand
square
miles
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
coast
line
and
an
estimated
total
population
of
two
million
of
which
fifty
thousand
are
civilized
the
revenue
amounted
in
to
the
imports
in
were
and
the
exports
the
latter
consisted
chiefly
of
rubber
palm
oil
and
kernels
coffee
piassava
fiber
ivory
ginger
camwood
and
arnotto
perhaps
liberia
greatest
citizen
was
the
late
edward
wilmot
blyden
who
migrated
in
early
life
from
the
danish
west
indies
and
became
a
prophet
of
the
renaissance
of
the
negro
race
turning
now
from
guinea
we
pass
down
the
west
coast
in
diego
cam
of
portugal
sailing
this
coast
set
a
stone
at
the
mouth
of
a
great
river
which
he
called
the
mighty
but
which
eventually
came
to
be
known
by
the
name
of
the
powerful
negro
kingdom
through
which
it
flowed
the
congo
we
must
think
of
the
valley
of
the
congo
with
its
intricate
interlacing
of
water
routes
and
jungle
of
forests
as
a
vast
caldron
shut
away
at
first
from
the
african
world
by
known
and
unknown
physical
hindrances
then
it
was
penetrated
by
the
tiny
red
dwarfs
and
afterward
horde
after
horde
of
tall
black
men
swirled
into
the
valley
like
a
maelstrom
moving
usually
from
north
to
east
and
from
south
to
west
the
congo
valley
became
therefore
the
center
of
the
making
of
what
we
know
as
the
bantu
nations
they
are
not
a
unified
people
but
a
congeries
of
tribes
of
considerable
physical
diversity
united
by
the
compelling
bond
of
language
and
other
customs
imposed
on
the
conquered
by
invading
conquerors
the
history
or
these
invasions
we
must
largely
imagine
between
two
and
three
thousand
years
ago
the
wilder
tribes
of
negroes
began
to
move
out
of
the
region
south
or
southeast
of
lake
chad
this
was
always
a
land
of
shadows
and
legends
where
fearful
cannibals
dwelt
and
where
no
egyptian
or
ethiopian
or
sudanese
armies
dared
to
go
it
is
possible
however
that
pressure
from
civilization
in
the
nile
valley
and
rising
culture
around
lake
chad
was
at
this
time
reënforced
by
expansion
of
the
culture
on
the
west
coast
perhaps
too
developing
culture
around
the
great
lakes
in
the
east
beckoned
or
the
riotous
fertility
of
the
congo
valleys
became
known
at
any
rate
the
movement
commenced
now
by
slow
stages
now
in
wild
forays
there
may
have
been
a
preliminary
movement
from
east
to
west
to
the
gulf
of
guinea
the
main
movement
however
was
eastward
skirting
the
congo
forests
and
passing
down
by
the
victoria
nyanza
and
lake
tanganyika
here
two
paths
beckoned
the
lakes
and
the
sea
to
the
east
the
congo
to
the
west
a
great
stream
of
men
swept
toward
the
ocean
and
dividing
turned
northward
and
fought
its
way
down
the
nile
valley
and
into
the
abyssinian
highlands
another
branch
turned
south
and
approached
the
zambesi
where
we
shall
meet
it
again
another
horde
of
invaders
turned
westward
and
entered
the
valley
of
the
congo
in
three
columns
the
northern
column
moved
along
the
lualaba
and
congo
rivers
to
the
cameroons
the
second
column
became
the
industrial
and
luba
and
lunda
peoples
in
the
southern
congo
valley
and
angola
while
the
third
column
moved
into
damaraland
and
mingled
with
bushman
and
hottentot
in
the
congo
valley
the
invaders
settled
in
village
and
plain
absorbed
such
indigenous
inhabitants
as
they
found
or
drove
them
deeper
into
the
forest
and
immediately
began
to
develop
industry
and
political
organization
they
became
skilled
agriculturists
raising
in
some
localities
a
profusion
of
cereals
fruit
and
vegetables
such
as
manioc
maize
yams
sweet
potatoes
ground
nuts
sorghum
gourds
beans
peas
bananas
and
plantains
everywhere
they
showed
skill
in
mining
and
the
welding
of
iron
copper
and
other
metals
they
made
weapons
wire
and
ingots
cloth
and
pottery
and
a
widespread
system
of
trade
arose
some
tribes
extracted
rubber
from
the
talamba
root
others
had
remarkable
breeds
of
fowl
and
cattle
and
still
others
divided
their
people
by
crafts
into
farmers
smiths
boat
builders
warriors
cabinet
makers
armorers
and
speakers
women
here
and
there
took
part
in
public
assemblies
and
were
rulers
in
some
cases
large
towns
were
built
some
of
which
required
hours
to
traverse
from
end
to
end
many
tribes
developed
intelligence
of
a
high
order
wissmann
called
the
ba
luba
a
nation
of
thinkers
bateman
found
them
thoroughly
and
unimpeachably
honest
brave
to
foolhardiness
and
faithful
to
each
other
and
to
their
superiors
one
of
their
kings
calemba
a
really
princely
prince
bateman
says
would
amongst
any
people
be
a
remarkable
and
indeed
in
many
respects
a
magnificent
man
these
beginnings
of
human
culture
were
however
peculiarly
vulnerable
to
invading
hosts
of
later
comers
there
were
no
natural
protecting
barriers
like
the
narrow
nile
valley
or
the
kong
mountains
or
the
forests
below
lake
chad
once
the
pathways
to
the
valley
were
open
and
for
hundreds
of
years
the
newcomers
kept
arriving
especially
from
the
welter
of
tribes
south
of
the
sudan
and
west
of
the
nile
which
rising
culture
beyond
kept
in
unrest
and
turmoil
against
these
intruders
there
was
but
one
defense
the
state
state
building
was
thus
forced
on
the
congo
valley
how
early
it
started
we
can
not
say
but
when
the
portuguese
arrived
in
the
fifteenth
century
there
had
existed
for
centuries
a
large
state
among
the
with
its
capital
at
the
city
now
known
as
san
salvador
the
negro
mfumu
or
emperor
was
eventually
induced
to
accept
christianity
his
sons
and
many
young
negroes
of
high
birth
were
taken
to
portugal
to
be
educated
there
several
were
raised
to
the
catholic
priesthood
and
one
became
bishop
others
distinguished
themselves
at
the
universities
thus
suddenly
there
arose
a
catholic
kingdom
south
of
the
valley
of
the
congo
which
lasted
three
centuries
but
was
partially
overthrown
by
invading
barbarians
from
the
interior
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
king
of
congo
still
reigns
as
pensioner
of
portugal
and
on
the
coast
are
the
remains
of
the
kingdom
in
the
civilized
blacks
and
mulattoes
who
are
intelligent
traders
and
boat
builders
meantime
the
people
to
the
eastward
founded
kantanga
and
other
states
and
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
larger
and
more
ambitious
realm
of
the
mwata
yamvo
the
last
of
the
fourteen
rulers
of
this
line
was
feudal
lord
of
about
three
hundred
chiefs
who
paid
him
tribute
in
ivory
skins
corn
cloth
and
salt
his
territory
included
about
one
hundred
thousand
square
miles
and
two
million
or
more
inhabitants
eventually
this
state
became
torn
by
internal
strife
and
revolt
especially
by
attacks
from
the
south
across
the
divide
farther
north
among
the
and
the
the
village
policy
persisted
and
the
cannibals
of
the
northeast
pressed
down
on
the
more
settled
tribes
the
result
was
a
curious
blending
of
war
and
industry
artistic
tastes
and
savage
customs
the
organized
slave
trade
of
the
arabs
penetrated
the
congo
valley
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
soon
was
aiding
all
the
forces
of
unrest
and
turmoil
industry
was
deranged
and
many
tribes
forced
to
take
refuge
in
caves
and
other
hiding
places
here
as
on
the
west
coast
disintegration
and
retrogression
followed
for
as
the
american
traffic
lessened
the
arabian
traffic
increased
when
therefore
stanley
opened
the
congo
valley
to
modern
knowledge
leopold
ii
of
belgium
conceived
the
idea
of
founding
here
a
free
international
state
which
was
to
bring
civilization
to
the
heart
of
africa
consequently
there
was
formed
in
an
international
committee
to
study
the
region
stanley
was
finally
commissioned
to
inquire
as
to
the
best
way
of
introducing
european
trade
and
culture
i
am
charged
he
said
to
open
and
keep
open
if
possible
all
such
districts
and
countries
as
i
may
explore
for
the
benefit
of
the
commercial
world
the
mission
is
supported
by
a
philanthropic
society
which
numbers
nobleminded
men
of
several
nations
it
is
not
a
religious
society
but
my
instructions
are
entirely
of
that
spirit
no
violence
must
be
used
and
wherever
rejected
the
mission
must
withdraw
to
seek
another
field
the
bula
matadi
or
stone
breaker
as
the
natives
called
stanley
threw
himself
energetically
into
the
work
and
had
by
built
a
road
past
the
falls
to
the
plateau
where
thousands
of
miles
of
river
navigation
were
thus
opened
stations
were
established
and
by
stanley
returned
armed
with
four
hundred
and
fifty
treaties
with
the
native
chiefs
and
the
new
state
appealed
to
the
world
for
recognition
the
united
states
first
recognized
the
congo
free
state
which
was
at

by

its

an
area
of
about

with

one
of
the
first
tasks
before
the

was
to
check
the
arab

traders
the
arabs
had
hitherto
acted
as
traders
and
middlemen
along
the

congo
and
when
the
english
and
congo
state
overthrew
mzidi
the
reigning
king
in
the
kantanga
country
a
general
revolt
of
the
arabs
and
mulattoes
took
place
for
a
time
the
whites
were
driven
out
but
in
a
year
or
two
the

their
allies
were
subdued
humanity
and
commerce
however
did
not
replace
the
arab

traders
rather
european
greed
and
serfdom
were
substituted
the
land
was
confiscated
by
the
state
and
farmed
out
to
private
belgian
corporations
the
wilder
cannibal
tribes
were
formed
into
a
militia
to
prey
on
the
industrious
who
were
taxed
with
specific
amounts
of
ivory
and
rubber
and
scourged
and
mutilated
if
they
failed

that

meant
the
death
of
twelve
million
natives
europe
was
staggered
at
the
leopoldian
atrocities
and
they
were
terrible
indeed
but
what
we
who
were
behind
the
scenes
felt
most
keenly
was
the
fact
that
the
real
catastrophe
in
the
congo
was
the
desolation
and
murder
in
the
larger
sense
the
invasion
of
family
life
the
ruthless
destruction
of
every
social
barrier
the
shattering
of
every
tribal
law
the
introduction
of
criminal
practices
which
struck
the
chiefs
of
the
people
dumb
with
horror
in
a
word
a
veritable
avalanche
of
filth
and
immorality
overwhelmed
the
congo
tribes
so
notorious
did
the
exploitation
and
misrule
become
that
leopold
was
forced
to
take
measures
toward
reform
and
finally
in
the
free
state
became
a
belgian
colony
some
reforms
have
been
inaugurated
and
others
may
follow
but
the
valley
of
the
congo
will
long
stand
as
a
monument
of
shame
to
christianity
and
european
civilization

the
great
lakes
and
zymbabwe
we
have
already
seen
how
a
branch
of
the
conquering
bantus
turned
eastward
by
the
great
lakes
and
thus
reached
the
sea
and
eventually
both
the
nile
and
south
africa
this
brought
them
into
the
ancient
and
mysterious
land
far
up
the
nile
south
of
ethiopia
here
lay
the
ancient
punt
of
the
egyptians
whether
we
place
it
in
somaliland
or
as
seems
far
more
likely
around
the
great
lakes
and
here
as
the
egyptians
thought
their
civilization
began
the
earliest
inhabitants
of
the
land
were
apparently
of
the
bushman
or
hottentot
type
of
negro
these
were
gradually
pushed
southward
and
westward
by
the
intrusion
of
the
nilotic
negroes
five
thousand
years
before
christ
the
mulatto
egyptians
were
in
the
nile
valley
below
the
first
cataract
the
negroes
were
in
the
nile
valley
down
as
far
as
the
second
cataract
and
between
the
first
and
second
cataracts
were
negroes
into
whose
veins
semitic
blood
had
penetrated
more
or
less
these
mixed
elements
became
the
ancestors
of
the
modern
somali
gala
bishari
and
beja
and
spread
negro
blood
into
arabia
beyond
the
red
sea
the
nilotic
negroes
to
the
south
early
became
great
traders
in
ivory
gold
leopard
skins
gums
beasts
birds
and
slaves
and
they
opened
up
systematic
trade
between
egypt
and
the
great
lakes
the
result
was
endless
movement
and
migration
both
in
ancient
and
modern
days
which
makes
the
cultural
history
of
the
great
lakes
region
very
difficult
to
understand
three
great
elements
are
however
clear
first
the
egyptian
element
by
the
northward
migration
of
the
negro
ancestors
of
predynastic
egypt
and
the
southern
conquests
and
trade
of
dynastic
egypt
second
the
semitic
influence
from
arabia
and
persia
third
the
negro
influences
from
western
and
central
africa
the
migration
of
the
bantu
is
the
first
clearly
defined
movement
of
modern
times
as
we
have
shown
they
began
to
move
southward
at
least
a
thousand
years
before
christ
skirting
the
congo
forests
and
wandering
along
the
great
lakes
and
down
to
the
zambesi
what
did
they
find
in
this
land
we
do
not
know
certainly
but
from
what
we
do
know
we
may
reconstruct
the
situation
in
this
way
the
primitive
culture
of
the
hottentots
of
punt
had
been
further
developed
by
them
and
by
other
stronger
negro
stocks
until
it
reached
a
highly
developed
culture
widespread
agriculture
and
mining
of
gold
silver
and
precious
stones
started
a
trade
that
penetrated
to
asia
and
north
africa
this
may
have
been
the
source
of
the
gold
of
the
ophir
the
state
that
thus
arose
became
in
time
strongly
organized
it
employed
slave
labor
in
crushing
the
hard
quartz
sinking
pits
and
carrying
underground
galleries
it
carried
out
a
system
of
irrigation
and
built
stone
buildings
and
fortifications
there
exists
many
remains
of
these
building
operations
in
the
kalahari
desert
and
in
northern
rhodesia
five
hundred
groups
covering
over
an
area
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
square
miles
lie
between
the
limpopo
and
zambesi
rivers
mining
operations
have
been
carried
on
in
these
plains
for
generations
and
one
estimate
is
that
at
least
three
hundred
and
million
worth
of
gold
had
been
extracted
some
have
thought
that
the
older
workings
must
date
back
to
one
or
even
three
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
there
are
other
mines
writes
de
barros
in
the
seventeenth
century
in
a
district
called
toroa
which
is
otherwise
known
as
the
kingdom
of
butua
whose
ruler
is
a
prince
by
name
burrow
a
vassal
of
benomotapa
this
land
is
near
the
other
which
we
said
consisted
of
extensive
plains
and
those
ruins
are
the
oldest
that
are
known
in
that
region
they
are
all
in
a
plain
in
the
middle
of
which
stands
a
square
fortress
all
of
dressed
stones
within
and
without
well
wrought
and
of
marvelous
size
without
any
lime
showing
the
joinings
the
walls
of
which
are
over
hands
thick
but
the
height
is
not
so
great
compared
to
the
thickness
and
above
the
gateway
of
that
edifice
is
an
inscription
which
some
moorish
arab
traders
who
were
there
could
not
read
nor
say
what
writing
it
was
all
these
structures
the
people
of
this
country
call
symbaoe
zymbabwe
which
with
them
means
a
court
for
every
place
where
benomotapa
stays
is
so
called
later
investigation
has
shown
that
these
buildings
were
in
many
cases
carefully
planned
and
built
fortifications
at
niekerk
for
instance
nine
or
ten
hills
are
fortified
on
concentric
walls
thirty
to
fifty
feet
in
number
with
a
place
for
the
village
at
the
top
the
buildings
are
forts
miniature
citadels
and
also
workshops
and
cattle
kraals
iron
implements
and
handsome
pottery
were
found
here
and
close
to
the
zambesi
there
are
extraordinary
fortifications
farther
south
at
inyanga
there
is
less
strong
defense
and
at
umtali
there
are
no
fortifications
showing
that
builders
feared
invasion
from
the
north
these
people
worked
in
gold
silver
tin
copper
and
bronze
and
made
beautiful
pottery
there
is
evidence
of
religious
significance
in
the
buildings
and
what
is
called
the
temple
was
the
royal
residence
and
served
as
a
sort
of
acropolis
the
surrounding
residences
in
the
valley
were
evidently
occupied
by
wealthy
traders
and
were
not
fortified
here
the
gold
was
received
from
surrounding
districts
and
bartered
with
traders
as
usual
there
have
been
repeated
attempts
to
find
an
external
and
especially
an
asiatic
origin
for
this
culture
so
far
however
archeological
research
seems
to
confirm
its
african
origin
the
implements
weapons
and
art
are
characteristically
african
and
there
is
no
evident
connection
with
outside
sources
how
far
back
this
civilization
dates
it
is
difficult
to
say
a
great
deal
depending
upon
the
dating
of
the
iron
age
in
south
africa
if
it
was
the
same
as
in
the
mediterranean
regions
the
earliest
limit
was
it
might
however
have
been
much
earlier
especially
if
as
seems
probable
the
use
of
iron
originated
in
africa
on
the
other
hand
the
culmination
of
this
culture
has
been
placed
by
some
as
late
as
the
modern
middle
ages
what
was
it
that
overthrew
this
civilization
undoubtedly
the
same
sort
of
raids
of
barbarous
warriors
that
we
have
known
in
our
day
for
instance
in
there
came
upon
the
country
of
mozambique
farther
up
the
coast
such
an
inundation
of
pagans
that
they
could
not
be
numbered
they
came
from
that
part
of
monomotapa
where
is
the
great
lake
from
which
spring
these
great
rivers
they
left
no
other
signs
of
the
towns
they
passed
but
the
heaps
of
ruins
and
the
bones
of
inhabitants
so
too
it
is
told
how
the
zimbas
came
a
strange
people
never
before
seen
there
who
leaving
their
own
country
traversed
a
great
part
of
this
ethiopia
like
a
scourge
of
god
destroying
every
living
thing
they
came
across
they
were
twenty
thousand
strong
and
marched
without
children
or
women
just
as
four
hundred
years
later
the
zulu
impi
marched
again
in
a
horde
of
people
came
from
the
interior
called
the
cabires
or
cannibals
they
entered
the
kingdom
of
monomotapa
and
the
reigning
king
being
weak
was
in
great
terror
thus
gradually
the
monomotapa
fell
and
its
power
was
scattered
until
the
raids
of
our
day
the
arab
writer
macoudi
in
the
tenth
century
visited
the
east
african
coast
somewhere
north
of
the
equator
he
found
the
indian
sea
at
that
time
frequented
by
arab
and
persian
vessels
but
there
were
no
asiatic
settlements
on
the
african
shore
the
bantu
or
as
he
calls
them
zenji
inhabited
the
country
as
far
south
as
sofala
where
they
bordered
upon
the
bushmen
these
bantus
were
under
a
ruler
with
the
dynastic
title
of
waklimi
he
was
paramount
over
all
the
other
tribes
of
the
north
and
could
put
three
hundred
thousand
men
in
the
field
they
used
oxen
as
beasts
of
burden
and
the
country
produced
gold
in
abundance
while
panther
skin
was
largely
used
for
clothing
ivory
was
sold
to
asia
and
the
bantu
used
iron
for
personal
adornment
instead
of
gold
or
silver
they
rode
on
their
oxen
which
ran
with
great
speed
and
they
ate
millet
and
honey
and
the
flesh
of
animals
inland
among
the
bantu
arose
later
the
line
of
rulers
called
the
monomotapa
among
the
gifted
makalanga
their
state
was
very
extensive
ranging
from
the
coast
far
into
the
interior
and
from
mozambique
down
to
the
limpopo
it
was
strongly
organized
with
feudatory
allied
states
and
carried
on
an
extensive
commerce
by
means
of
the
traders
on
the
coast
the
kings
were
converted
to
nominal
christianity
by
the
portuguese
there
are
indications
of
trade
between
nupe
in
west
africa
and
sofala
on
the
east
coast
and
certainly
trade
between
asia
and
east
africa
is
earlier
than
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
the
asiatic
traders
settled
on
the
coast
and
by
means
of
mulatto
and
negro
merchants
brought
central
africa
into
contact
with
arabia
india
china
and
malaysia
the
coming
of
the
asiatics
was
in
this
wise
zaide
of
ali
nephew
and
of
mohammed
was
banished
from
arabia
as
a
heretic
he
passed
over
to
africa
and
formed
temporary
settlements
his
people
mingled
with
the
blacks
and
the
resulting
mulatto
traders
known
as
the
emoxaidi
seem
to
have
wandered
as
far
south
as
the
equator
soon
other
arabian
families
came
over
on
account
of
oppression
and
founded
the
towns
of
magadosho
and
brava
both
not
far
north
of
the
equator
the
first
town
became
a
place
of
importance
and
other
settlements
were
made
the
emoxaidi
whom
the
later
immigrants
regarded
as
heretics
were
driven
inland
and
became
the
interpreting
traders
between
the
coast
and
the
bantu
some
wanderers
from
magadosho
came
into
the
port
of
sofala
and
there
learned
that
gold
could
be
obtained
this
led
to
a
small
arab
settlement
at
that
place
seventy
years
later
and
about
fifty
years
before
the
norman
conquest
of
england
certain
persians
settled
at
kilwa
in
east
africa
led
by
ali
who
had
been
despised
in
his
land
because
he
was
the
son
of
a
black
abyssinian
slave
mother
kilwa
because
of
this
eventually
became
the
most
important
commercial
station
on
the
east
african
coast
and
in
this
and
all
these
settlements
a
very
large
mulatto
population
grew
up
so
that
very
soon
the
whole
settlement
was
indistinguishable
in
color
from
the
bantu
in
ibn
batuta
visited
kilwa
he
found
an
abundance
of
ivory
and
some
gold
and
heard
that
the
inhabitants
of
kilwa
had
gained
victories
over
the
zenji
or
bantu
kilwa
had
at
that
time
three
hundred
mosques
and
was
built
of
handsome
houses
of
stone
and
lime
and
very
lofty
with
their
windows
like
those
of
the
christians
in
the
same
way
it
has
streets
and
these
houses
have
got
terraces
and
the
is
with
the
masonry
with
plenty
of
gardens
in
which
there
are
many
fruit
trees
and
much
water
kilwa
after
a
time
captured
sofala
seizing
it
from
magadosho
eventually
kilwa
became
mistress
of
the
island
of
zanzibar
of
mozambique
and
of
much
other
territory
the
ruler
of
kilwa
after
ali
was
named
abraham
and
he
was
ruling
when
the
portuguese
arrived
the
latter
reported
that
these
people
cultivated
rice
and
cocoa
built
ships
and
had
considerable
commerce
with
asia
all
the
people
of
whatever
color
were
mohammedans
and
the
richer
were
clothed
in
gorgeous
robes
of
silk
and
velvet
they
traded
with
the
inland
bantus
and
met
numerous
tribes
receiving
gold
ivory
millet
rice
cattle
poultry
and
honey
on
the
islands
the
asiatics
were
independent
but
on
the
main
lands
south
of
kilwa
the
sheiks
ruled
only
their
own
people
under
the
overlordship
of
the
bantus
to
whom
they
were
compelled
to
pay
large
tribute
each
year
vasco
da
gama
doubled
the
cape
of
good
hope
in
and
went
north
on
the
east
coast
as
far
as
india
in
the
next
ten
years
the
portuguese
had
occupied
more
than
six
different
points
on
that
coast
including
sofala
thus
civilization
waxed
and
waned
in
east
africa
among
prehistoric
negroes
arab
and
persian
mulattoes
on
the
coast
in
the
zend
or
zeng
empire
of
bantu
negroes
and
later
in
the
bantu
rule
of
the
monomotapa
and
thus
too
among
later
throngs
of
the
fiercer
warlike
bantu
the
ancient
culture
of
the
land
largely
died
yet
something
survived
and
in
the
modern
bantu
state
language
and
industry
can
be
found
clear
links
that
establish
the
essential
identity
of
the
absorbed
peoples
with
the
builders
of
zymbabwe
so
far
we
have
traced
the
history
of
the
lands
into
which
the
southward
stream
of
invading
bantus
turned
and
have
followed
them
to
the
limpopo
river
we
turn
now
to
the
lands
north
from
lake
nyassa
the
aboriginal
negroes
sustained
in
prehistoric
time
invasions
from
the
northeast
by
negroids
of
a
type
like
the
ancient
egyptians
and
like
the
modern
gallas
masai
and
somalis
to
these
migrations
were
added
attacks
from
the
nile
negroes
to
the
north
and
the
bantu
invaders
from
the
south
this
has
led
to
great
differences
among
the
groups
of
the
population
and
in
their
customs
some
are
fierce
mountaineers
occupying
hilly
plateaus
six
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
level
others
like
the
wa
swahili
are
traders
on
the
coast
there
are
the
masai
and
organized
for
war
and
cattle
lifting
and
negroids
like
the
gallas
who
blending
with
the
bantus
have
produced
the
race
of
modern
uganda
it
was
in
this
region
that
the
kingdom
of
kitwara
was
founded
by
the
galla
chief
kintu
about
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
empire
was
dismembered
the
largest
share
falling
to
uganda
the
ensuing
history
of
uganda
is
of
great
interest
when
king
mutesa
came
to
the
throne
in
he
found

indeed
the

the

the
mass
of
them
settled
down

the

were
true
cave
dwellers
but
the
sculptors
lived
in
large
communities
on
the
stony
hills
which
they
marked
with
their

these
bushmen
believed
in
an
ancient
race
of
people
who
preceded
them
in
south
africa
they
attributed
magic
power
to
these
unknown
folk
and
said
that
some
of
them
had
been
translated
as
stars
to
the
sky
before
their
groups
were
dispersed
the
bushmen
had
regular
government
tribes
with
their

occupied
tracts
of

were

the

the
bushmen
suffered
most
cruelly
in
the
succeeding
migrations

conquests
of

they
fought
desperately
in
they
saw
their
women
and
children
carried
into
bondage
and
they
themselves
hunted
like
wild
beasts
both
savage
and
civilized
men
appropriated
their

still
they
were
brave
people
in
this
struggle
for
existence
their
bitterest
enemies
of
whatever
shade
of
color
they
might
be
were
forced
to
make
an
unqualified
acknowledgement
of
the
courage
and
daring
they
so
invariably
exhibited
here
to
a
remote
corner
of
the
world
where
as
one
of
their
number
said
they
had
supposed
that
the
only
beings
in
the
world
were
bushmen
and
lions
came
a
series
of
invaders
it
was
the
outer
ripples
of
civilization
starting
far
away
the
indigenous
and
external
civilizations
of
africa
beating
with
great
impulse
among
the
ethiopians
and
the
egyptian
mulattoes
and
sudanese
negroes
and
yorubans
and
driving
the
bantu
race
southward
the
bantus
crowded
more
and
more
upon
the
primitive
bushmen
and
probably
a
mingling
of
the
bushmen
and
the
bantus
gave
rise
to
the
hottentots
the
hottentots
or
as
they
called
themselves
khoi
khoin
men
of
men
were
physically
a
stronger
race
than
the
abatwa
and
gave
many
evidences
of
degeneration
from
a
high
culture
especially
in
the
phenomenal
perfection
of
a
language
which
is
so
highly
developed
both
in
its
rich
phonetic
system
as
represented
by
a
very
delicately
graduated
series
of
vowels
and
diphthongs
and
in
its
varied
grammatical
structure
that
lepsius
sought
for
its
affinities
in
the
egyptian
at
the
other
end
of
the
continent
when
south
africa
was
first
discovered
there
were
two
distinct
types
of
hottentot
the
more
savage
hottentots
were
simply
large
strong
bushmen
using
weapons
superior
to
the
bushmen
without
domestic
cattle
or
sheep
other
tribes
nearer
the
center
of
south
africa
were
handsomer
in
appearance
and
raised
an
egyptian
breed
of
cattle
which
they
rode
in
general
the
hottentots
were
yellow
with
hair
high
cheek
bones
and
somewhat
oblique
eyes
their
migration
commenced
about
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
and
was
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
a
scattered
straggling
movement
the
traditions
of
the
hottentots
point
to
the
lake
country
of
central
africa
as
their
place
of
origin
whence
they
were
driven
by
the
bechuana
tribes
of
the
bantu
they
fled
westward
to
the
ocean
and
then
turned
south
and
came
upon
the
bushmen
whom
they
had
only
partially
subdued
when
the
dutch
arrived
as
settlers
in
the
dutch
boers
began
by
purchasing
land
from
the
hottentots
and
then
as
they
grew
more
powerful
they
dispossessed
the
dark
men
and
tried
to
enslave
them
there
grew
up
a
large
class
indeed
the
filtration
of
negro
blood
noticeable
in
modern
boers
accounts
for
much
curious
history
soon
after
the
advent
of
the
dutch
some
of
the
hottentots
of
whom
there
were
not
more
than
thirty
or
forty
thousand
led
by
the
korana
clans
began
slowly
to
retreat
northward
followed
by
the
invading
dutch
and
fighting
the
dutch
each
other
and
the
wretched
bushmen
in
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
hottentots
had
reached
the
great
interior
plain
and
met
the
outposts
of
the
bantu
nations
the
bechuana
whom
the
hottentots
first
met
were
the
most
advanced
of
the
negro
tribes
of
central
africa
they
had
crossed
the
zambesi
in
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
century
their
government
was
a
sort
of
feudal
system
with
hereditary
chiefs
and
vassals
they
were
careful
agriculturists
laid
out
large
towns
with
great
regularity
and
were
the
most
skilled
of
smiths
they
used
stone
in
building
carved
on
wood
and
many
of
them
too
were
keen
traders
these
tribes
coming
southward
occupied
the
part
of
south
africa
comprising
modern
bechuanaland
apparently
they
had
started
from
the
central
lake
country
somewhere
late
in
the
fifteenth
century
and
by
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
one
of
their
great
chiefs
tao
met
the
hottentots
the
hottentots
compelled
tao
to
retreat
but
the
mulatto
gricquas
arrived
from
the
south
and
allying
themselves
with
the
bechuana
stopped
the
rout
the
gricquas
sprang
from
and
took
their
name
from
an
old
hottentot
tribe
they
were
led
by
kok
and
barends
and
by
adding
other
elements
they
became
partly
through
their
own
efforts
and
partly
through
the
efforts
of
the
missionaries
a
community
of
fairly
well
civilized
people
in
gricqualand
west
the
mulatto
gricquas
under
their
chiefs
kok
and
waterboer
lived
until
the
discovery
of
diamonds
the
griquas
and
bechuana
tribes
were
thus
gradually
checking
the
hottentots
when
in
the
nineteenth
century
there
came
two
new
developments
first
the
english
took
possession
of
cape
colony
and
the
dutch
began
to
move
in
larger
numbers
toward
the
interior
secondly
a
newer
and
fiercer
element
of
the
bantu
tribes
the
appeared
the
kaffirs
or
as
they
called
themselves
the
amazosas
claimed
descent
from
zuide
a
great
chief
of
the
fifteenth
century
in
the
lake
country
they
are
among
the
tallest
people
in
the
world
averaging
five
feet
ten
inches
and
are
slim
and
muscular
the
more
warlike
tribes
were
usually
clothed
in
leopard
or
ox
skins
cattle
formed
their
chief
wealth
stock
breeding
and
hunting
and
fighting
their
main
pursuits
mentally
they
were
men
of
tact
and
intelligence
with
a
national
religion
based
upon
ancestor
worship
while
their
government
was
a
patriarchal
monarchy
limited
by
an
aristocracy
and
almost
feudal
in
character
the
common
law
which
had
grown
up
from
the
decisions
of
the
chiefs
made
the
head
of
the
family
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
its
branches
a
village
for
all
its
residents
and
the
clan
for
all
its
villages
finally
there
was
a
paramount
chief
who
was
the
civil
and
military
father
of
his
people
these
people
laid
waste
to
the
coast
regions
and
in
came
in
contact
with
the
dutch
a
series
of
wars
ensued
between
and
in
which
the
dutch
were
hard
pressed
in
the
english
took
final
possession
of
cape
colony
at
that
time
there
were
thousand
boers
thousand
pure
and
mixed
hottentots
and
thousand
slaves
secured
from
the
east
coast
between
and
there
were
six
wars
one
of
these
in
grew
out
of
the
ignorant
interference
of
the
english
with
the
kaffir
tribal
system
then
there
came
a
terrible
war
between
and
followed
by
the
annexation
of
all
the
country
as
far
as
the
kei
river
the
war
of
the
axe
led
to
further
annexation
by
the
british
hostilities
broke
out
again
in
and
in
the
former
year
despairing
of
resistance
to
invading
england
a
prophet
arose
who
advised
the
wholesale
destruction
of
all
kaffir
property
except
weapons
in
order
that
this
faith
might
bring
back
their
dead
heroes
the
result
was
that
almost
a
third
of
the
nation
perished
from
hunger
fresh
troubles
occurred
in
when
the
confederacy
was
finally
broken
up
and
gradually
these
tribes
are
passing
from
independence
to
a
state
of
mild
vassalage
to
the
british
meantime
the
more
formidable
part
of
the
had
been
united
under
the
terrible
chief
chaka
he
had
organized
a
military
system
not
a
new
one
by
any
means
but
one
of
which
we
hear
rumors
back
in
the
lake
regions
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
mcdonald
says
there
has
probably
never
been
a
more
perfect
system
of
discipline
than
that
by
which
chaka
ruled
his
army
and
kingdom
at
a
review
an
order
might
be
given
in
the
most
unexpected
manner
which
meant
death
to
hundreds
if
the
regiment
hesitated
or
dared
to
remonstrate
so
perfect
was
the
discipline
and
so
great
the
jealousy
that
another
was
ready
to
cut
them
down
a
warrior
returning
from
battle
without
his
arms
was
put
to
death
without
trial
a
general
returning
unsuccessful
in
the
main
purpose
of
his
expedition
shared
the
same
fate
whoever
displeased
the
king
was
immediately
executed
the
traditional
courts
practically
ceased
to
exist
so
far
as
the
will
and
action
of
the
tyrant
was
concerned
with
this
army
chaka
fell
on
tribe
after
tribe
the
bechuana
fled
before
him
and
some
tribes
of
them
were
entirely
destroyed
the
hottentots
suffered
severely
and
one
of
his
rival
zulu
tribes
under
umsilikatsi
fled
into
matabililand
pushing
back
the
bechuana
by
the
time
the
english
came
to
port
natal
chaka
was
ruling
over
the
whole
southeastern
seaboard
from
the
limpopo
river
to
cape
colony
including
the
orange
and
transvaal
states
and
the
whole
of
natal
chaka
was
killed
in
and
was
eventually
succeeded
by
his
brother
dingan
who
reigned
twelve
years
it
was
during
dingan
reign
that
england
tried
to
abolish
slavery
in
cape
colony
but
did
not
pay
promptly
for
the
slaves
as
she
had
promised
the
result
was
the
great
trek
about
when
thousands
of
boers
went
into
the
interior
across
the
orange
and
vaal
rivers
dingan
and
these
boers
were
soon
engaged
in
a
death
struggle
in
which
the
zulus
were
repulsed
and
dingan
replaced
by
panda
under
this
chief
there
was
something
like
repose
for
sixteen
years
but
in
civil
war
broke
out
between
his
sons
one
of
whom
cetewayo
succeeded
his
father
in
he
fell
into
border
disputes
with
the
english
and
the
result
was
one
of
the
fiercest
clashes
of
europe
and
africa
in
modern
days
the
zulus
fought
desperately
annihilating
at
one
time
a
whole
detachment
and
killing
the
young
prince
napoleon
but
after
all
it
was
assagais
against
machine
guns
and
the
zulus
were
finally
defeated
at
ulundi
july
thereupon
zululand
was
divided
among
thirteen
chiefs
and
became
a
british
protectorate
illustration
ancient
kingdom
of
africa
since
then
the
best
lands
have
been
gradually
reoccupied
by
a
large
number
of
tribes
kaffirs
from
the
south
and
zulus
from
the
north
the
tribal
organization
without
being
actually
broken
up
has
been
deprived
of
its
dangerous
features
by
appointing
paid
village
headmen
and
transforming
the
hereditary
chief
into
a
british
government
official
in
natal
there
are
about
one
hundred
and
seventy
tribal
chiefs
and
nearly
half
of
these
have
been
appointed
by
the
governor
umsilikatsi
who
had
been
driven
into
matabililand
by
the
terrible
chaka
in
and
defeated
by
the
dutch
in
had
finally
reestablished
his
headquarters
in
rhodesia
in
here
he
introduced
the
zulu
military
system
and
terrorized
the
peaceful
and
industrious
bechuana
populations
lobengula
succeeded
umsilikatsi
in
and
realizing
that
his
power
was
waning
began
to
retreat
northward
toward
the
zambesi
he
was
finally
defeated
by
the
british
and
native
forces
in
and
the
land
was
incorporated
into
south
central
africa
the
result
of
all
these
movements
was
to
break
the
inhabitants
of
bechuanaland
into
numerous
fragments
there
were
small
numbers
of
mulatto
gricquas
in
the
southwest
and
similar
bastaards
in
the
northwest
the
hottentots
and
bushmen
were
dispersed
into
groups
and
seem
doomed
to
extinction

last
hottentot

deposed

and

by
an
english
magistrate
partially
civilized
hottentots
still
live
grouped
together
in
their
kraals

the
bechuana
hold
their
own
in
several
centers
one
is
in
basutoland
west
of
natal
where
a
number
of
tribes
were
welded
together
under
the
moshesh
into
a
modern
and
fairly
well
civilized
nation
in
the
north
part
of
bechuanaland
are
the
bamangwato
and
the

the
former
ruled
by

of

canniest
of

in

south
of

there
arose

contemporary
and

of

his

this
manikus
failed
to
do
and
to
escape

we
must
now
gather
these
threads
together
and
ask
what
manner
of
men
these
were
and
how
far
and
in
what
way
they
progressed
on
the
road
of
human
culture
that
negro
peoples
were
the
beginners
of
civilization
along
the
ganges
the
euphrates
and
the
nile
seems
proven
early
babylon
was
founded
by

negroid
race
hammurabi

most
ancient

says
anna
and

called

hammurabi
the
exalted
prince
the
worshiper
of
the
gods
to
cause
justice
to
prevail
in
the
land
to
destroy
the
wicked
to
prevent
the
strong
from
oppressing
the
weak
to
go
forth
like
the
sun
over
the
race
to
enlighten
the
land
and
to
further
the
welfare
of
the
people
the
assyrians
show
a
distinct
negroid
strain
and
early
egypt
was
predominantly
negro
these
earliest
of
cultures
were
crude
and
primitive
but
they
represented
the
highest
attainment
of
mankind
after
tens
of
thousands
of
years
in
unawakened
savagery
it
has
often
been
assumed
that
the
negro
is
physically
inferior
to
other
races
and
markedly
distinguishable
from
them
modern
science
gives
no
authority
for
such
an
assumption
the
supposed
inferiority
can
not
rest
on
color
for
that
is
due
to
the
combined
influences
of
a
great
number
of
factors
of
environment
working
through
physiological
processes
and
however
marked
the
contrasts
may
be
there
is
no
corresponding
difference
in
anatomical
structure
discoverable
so
too
difference
in
texture
of
hair
is
a
matter
of
degree
not
kind
and
is
caused
by
heat
moisture
exposure
and
the
like
the
bony
skeleton
presents
no
distinctly
racial
lines
of
variation
prognathism
presents
too
many
individual
varieties
to
be
taken
as
a
distinctive
character
of
race
difference
in
physical
measurements
does
not
show
the
negro
to
be
a
more
primitive
evolutionary
form
comparative
ethnology
affords
no
support
to
the
view
which
sees
in
the
lower
races
of
mankind
a
transition
stage
from
beast
to
man
much
has
been
made
of
the
supposed
smaller
brain
of
the
negro
race
but
this
is
as
yet
an
unproved
assumption
based
on
the
uncritical
measurement
of
less
than
a
thousand
negro
brains
as
compared
with
eleven
thousand
or
more
european
brains
even
if
future
measurement
prove
the
average
negro
brain
lighter
the
vast
majority
of
negro
brain
weights
fall
within
the
same
limits
as
the
whites
and
finally
neither
size
nor
weight
of
the
brain
seems
to
be
of
importance
as
an
index
of
mental
capacity
we
may
therefore
say
with
ratzel
there
is
only
one
species
of
man
the
variations
are
numerous
but
do
not
go
deep
to
this
we
may
add
the
word
of
the
secretary
of
the
first
races
congress
we
are
then
under
the
necessity
of
concluding
that
an
impartial
investigator
would
be
inclined
to
look
upon
the
various
important
peoples
of
the
world
as
to
all
intents
and
purposes
essentially
equal
in
intellect
enterprise
morality
and
physique
if
these
conclusions
are
true
we
should
expect
to
see
in
africa
the
human
drama
play
itself
out
much
as
in
other
lands
and
such
has
actually
been
the
fact
at
the
same
time
we
must
expect
peculiarities
arising
from
the
physiography
of
the
land
its
climate
its
rainfall
its
deserts
and
the
peculiar
inaccessibility
of
the
coast
three
principal
zones
of
habitation
appear
first
the
steppes
and
deserts
around
the
sahara
in
the
north
and
the
kalahari
desert
in
the
south
secondly
the
grassy
highlands
bordering
the
great
lakes
and
connecting
these
two
regions
thirdly
the
forests
and
rivers
of
central
and
west
africa
in
the
deserts
are
the
nomads
and
the
pygmies
are
in
the
forest
fastnesses
herdsmen
and
their
cattle
cover
the
steppes
and
highlands
save
where
the
tsetse
fly
prevents
in
the
open
forests
and
grassy
highlands
are
the
agriculturists
among
the
forest
farmers
the
village
is
the
center
of
life
while
in
the
open
steppes
political
life
tends
to
spread
into
larger
political
units
political
integration
is
however
hindered
by
an
ease
of
internal
communication
almost
as
great
as
the
difficulty
of
reaching
outer
worlds
beyond
the
continent
the
narrow
nile
valley
alone
presented
physical
barriers
formidable
enough
to
keep
back
the
invading
barbarians
of
the
south
and
even
then
with
difficulty
elsewhere
communication
was
all
too
easy
for
a
while
the
congo
forests
fended
away
the
restless
but
this
only
temporarily
on
the
whole
africa
from
the
sahara
to
the
cape
offered
no
great
physical
barrier
to
the
invader
and
we
continually
have
whirlwinds
of
invading
hosts
rushing
now
southward
now
northward
from
the
interior
to
the
coast
and
from
the
coast
inland
and
hurling
their
force
against
states
kingdoms
and
cities
some
resisted
for
generations
some
for
centuries
some
but
a
few
years
it
is
then
this
sudden
change
and
the
fear
of
it
that
marks
african
culture
particularly
in
its
political
aspects
and
which
makes
it
so
difficult
to
trace
this
changing
past
nevertheless
beneath
all
change
rests
the
strong
substructure
of
custom
religion
industry
and
art
well
worth
the
attention
of
students
starting
with
agriculture
we
learn
that
among
all
the
great
groups
of
the
races
the
negroes
are
the
best
and
keenest
tillers
of
the
ground
a
minority
despise
agriculture
and
breed
cattle
many
combine
both
occupations
among
the
genuine
tillers
the
whole
life
of
the
family
is
taken
up
in
agriculture
and
hence
the
months
are
by
preference
called
after
the
operations
which
they
demand
constant
clearings
change
forests
to
fields
and
the
ground
is
manured
with
the
ashes
of
the
burnt
thicket
in
the
middle
of
the
fields
rise
the
light
from
which
a
watchman
scares
birds
and
other
thieves
an
african
cultivated
landscape
is
incomplete
without
barns
the
rapidity
with
which
when
newly
imported
the
most
various
forms
of
cultivation
spread
in
africa
says
much
for
the
attention
which
is
devoted
to
this
branch
of
economy
industries
again
which
may
be
called
agricultural
like
the
preparation
of
meal
from
millet
and
other
crops
also
from
cassava
the
fabrication
of
fermented
drinks
from
grain
or
the
manufacture
of

sedulously
fostered
bücher

sight
suddenly
the
fields
of
the
natives
on
emerging
from
the
primeval
forests
in
the
more
thickly
populated
parts
of
africa
these
fields
often
stretch
for
many
a
mile
and
the
assiduous
care
of
the
negro
women
shines
in
all
the
brighter
light
when
we
consider
the
insecurity
of
life
the
constant
feuds
and
pillages
in
which
no
one
knows
whether
he
will
in
the
end
be
able
to
harvest
what
he
has
sown

devastations
wrought

so
marked
has
been
the
work
of
negro
artisans
and
traders
in
the
manufacture
and
exchange
of
iron
implements
that
a
growing
number
of
archeologists
are
disposed
to
consider
the
negro
as
the
originator
of
the
art
of
smelting
iron
gabriel
de
mortillet
declared
negroes
the
only
iron
users
among
primitive
people
some
would
therefore
argue
that
the
negro
learned
it
from
other
folk
but
andree
declares
that
the
negro
developed
his
own
iron
kingdom
schweinfurth
von
luschan
boaz
and
others
incline
to
the
belief
that
the
negroes
invented
the
smelting
of
iron
and
passed
it
on
to
the
egyptians
and
to
modern
europe
boaz
says
it
seems
likely
that
at
a
time
when
the
european
was
still
satisfied
with
rude
stone
tools
the
african
had
invented
or
adopted
the
art
of
smelting
iron
consider
for
a
moment
what
this
invention
has
meant
for
the
advance
of
the
human
race
as
long
as
the
hammer
knife
saw
drill
the
spade
and
the
hoe
had
to
be
chipped
out
of
stone
or
had
to
be
made
of
shell
or
hard
wood
effective
industrial
work
was
not
impossible
but
difficult
a
great
progress
was
made
when
copper
found
in
large
nuggets
was
hammered
out
into
tools
and
later
on
shaped
by
melting
and
when
bronze
was
introduced
but
the
true
advancement
of
industrial
life
did
not
begin
until
the
hard
iron
was
discovered
it
seems
not
unlikely
that
the
people
who
made
the
marvelous
discovery
of
reducing
iron
ores
by
smelting
were
the
african
negroes
neither
ancient
europe
nor
ancient
western
asia
nor
ancient
china
knew
the
iron
and
everything
points
to
its
introduction
from
africa
at
the
time
of
the
great
african
discoveries
toward
the
end
of
the
past
century
the
trade
of
the
blacksmith
was
found
all
over
africa
from
north
to
south
and
from
east
to
west
with
his
simple
bellows
and
a
charcoal
fire
he
reduced
the
ore
that
is
found
in
many
parts
of
the
continent
and
forged
implements
of
great
usefulness
and
beauty
torday
has
argued
recently
i
feel
convinced
by
certain
arguments
that
seem
to
prove
to
my
satisfaction
that
we
are
indebted
to
the
negro
for
the
very
keystone
of
our
modern
civilization
and
that
we
owe
him
the
discovery
of
iron
that
iron
could
be
discovered
by
accident
in
africa
seems
beyond
doubt
if
this
is
so
in
other
parts
of
the
world
i
am
not
competent
to
say
i
will
only
remind
you
that
schweinfurth
and
petherick
record
the
fact
that
in
the
northern
part
of
east
africa
smelting
furnaces
are
worked
without
artificial
air
current
and
on
the
other
hand
stuhlmann
and
kollmann
found
near
victoria
nyanza
that
the
natives
simply
mixed
powdered
ore
with
charcoal
and
by
introduction
of
air
currents
obtained
the
metal
these
simple
processes
make
it
simple
that
iron
should
have
been
discovered
in
east
or
central
africa
no
bronze
implements
have
ever
been
found
in
black
africa
had
the
africans
received
iron
from
the
egyptians
bronze
would
have
preceded
this
metal
and
all
traces
of
it
would
not
have
disappeared
black
africa
was
for
a
long
time
an
exporter
of
iron
and
even
in
the
twelfth
century
exports
to
india
and
java
are
recorded
by
idrisi
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
that
egypt
should
have
obtained
it
from
europe
where
the
oldest
find
in
hallstadt
can
not
be
of
an
earlier
period
than
or
from
asia
where
iron
is
not
known
before
and
where
in
the
times
of
ashur
nazir
pal
it
was
still
used
concurrently
with
bronze
while
iron
beads
have
been
only
recently
discovered
by
wainwright
and
bushe
fox
in
a
predynastic
grave
and
where
a
piece
of
this
metal
possibly
a
tool
was
found
in
the
masonry
of
the
great
pyramid
the
negro
is
a
born
trader
lenz
says
our
sharpest
european
merchants
even
jews
and
armenians
can
learn
much
of
the
cunning
and
trade
of
the
negroes
we
know
that
the
trade
between
central
africa
and
egypt
was
in
the
hands
of
negroes
for
thousands
of
years
and
in
early
days
the
cities
of
the

and
north
africa
grew
rich

negro
trade
leo

a
native
negro
student
tells
of
the
development
of
trade
among
the
ashanti
it
was
a
part
of
the
state
system
of
ashanti
to
encourage
trade
the
king
once
in
every
forty
days
at
the
adai
custom
distributed
among
a
number
of
chiefs
various
sums
of
gold
dust
with
a
charge
to
turn
the
same
to
good
account
these
chiefs
then
sent
down
to
the
coast
caravans
of
tradesmen
some
of
whom
would
be
their
slaves
sometimes
some
two
or
three
hundred
strong
to
barter
ivory
for
european
goods
or
buy
such
goods
with
gold
dust
which
the
king
obtained
from
the
royal
alluvial
workings
down
to
a
constant
stream
of
ashanti
traders
might
be
seen
daily
wending
their
way
to
the
merchants
of
the
coast
and
back
again
yielding
more
certain
wealth
and
prosperity
to
the
merchants
of
the
gold
coast
and
great
britain
than
may
be
expected
for
some
time
yet
to
come
from
the
mining
industry
and
railway
development
put
together
the
trade
chiefs
would
in
due
time
render
a
faithful
account
to
the
king
stewards
being
allowed
to
retain
a
fair
portion
of
the
profit
in
the
king
household
too
he
would
have
special
men
who
directly
traded
for
him
important
chiefs
carried
on
the
same
system
of
trading
with
the
coast
as
did
the
king
thus
every
member
of
the
state
from
the
king
downward
took
an
active
interest
in
the
promotion
of
trade
and
in
the
keeping
open
of
trade
routes
into
the
interior
the
trade
thus
encouraged
and
carried
on
in
various
parts
of
west
africa
reached
wide
areas
from
the
fish
river
to
kuka
and
from
lagos
to
zanzibar
the
markets
have
become
great
centers
of
trade
the
leading
implement
to
civilization
permanent
markets
are
found
in
places
like
ujiji
and
nyangwe
where
everything
can
be
bought
and
sold
from
earthenware
to
wives
from
the
one
to
three
thousand
traders
flocked
here
how
like
is
the
market
traffic
with
all
its
uproar
and
sound
of
human
voices
to
one
of
our
own
markets
there
is
the
same
rivalry
in
praising
the
goods
the
violent
brisk
movements
the
expressive
gesture
the
inquiring
searching
glance
the
changing
looks
of
depreciation
or
triumph
of
apprehension
delight
approbation
so
says
stanley
trade
customs
are
not
everywhere
alike
if
when
negotiating
with
the
bangalas
of
angola
you
do
not
quickly
give
them
what
they
want
they
go
away
and
do
not
come
back
then
perhaps
they
try
to
get
possession
of
the
coveted
object
by
means
of
theft
it
is
otherwise
with
the
songos
and
kiokos
who
let
you
deal
with
them
in
the
usual
way
to
buy
even
a
small
article
you
must
go
to
the
market
people
avoid
trading
anywhere
else
if
a
man
says
to
another
me
this
hen
or
fruit
the
answer
as
a
rule
will
be
to
the
market
place
the
crowd
gives
confidence
to
individuals
and
the
inviolability
of
the
visitor
to
the
market
and
of
the
market
itself
looks
like
an
idea
of
justice
consecrated
by
long
practice
does
not
this
remind
us
of
the
old
germanic
place
turning
now
to
negro
family
and
social
life
we
find
as
among
all
primitive
peoples
polygamy
and
marriage
by
actual
or
simulated
purchase
out
of
the
family
develops
the
typical
african
village
organization
which
is
thus
described
in
ashanti
by
a
native
gold
coast
writer
the
headman
as
his
name
implies
is
the
head
of
a
village
community
a
ward
in
a
township
or
of
a
family
his
position
is
important
inasmuch
as
he
has
directly
to
deal
with
the
composite
elements
of
the
general
bulk
of
the
people
it
is
the
duty
of
the
head
of
a
family
to
bring
up
the
members
thereof
in
the
way
they
should
go
and
by
you
must
understand
the
entire
lineal
descendants
of
a
materfamilias
if
i
may
coin
a
convenient
phrase
it
is
expected
of
him
by
the
state
to
bring
up
his
charge
in
the
knowledge
of
matters
political
and
traditional
it
is
his
work
to
train
up
his
wards
in
the
ways
of
loyalty
and
obedience
to
the
powers
that
be
he
is
held
responsible
for
the
freaks
of
recalcitrant
members
of
his
family
and
he
is
looked
to
to
keep
them
within
bounds
and
to
insist
upon
conformity
of
their
party
with
the
customs
laws
and
traditional
observances
of
the
community
in
early
times
he
could
send
off
to
exile
by
sale
a
troublesome
relative
who
would
not
observe
the
laws
of
the
community
it
is
a
difficult
task
that
he
is
set
to
but
in
this
matter
he
has
helpers
in
the
female
members
of
the
family
who
will
be
either
the
aunts
or
the
sisters
or
the
cousins
or
the
nieces
of
the
headman
and
as
their
interests
are
identical
with
his
in
every
particular
the
good
women
spontaneously
train
up
their
children
to
implicit
obedience
to
the
headman
whose
rule
in
the
family
thus
becomes
a
simple
and
an
easy
matter
hand
that
rocks
the
cradle
rules
the
world
what
a
power
for
good
in
the
native
state
system
would
the
mothers
of
the
gold
coast
and
ashanti
become
by
judicious
training
upon
native
lines
the
headman
is
par
excellence
the
judge
of
his
family
or
ward
not
only
is
he
called
upon
to
settle
domestic
squabbles
but
frequently
he
sits
judge
over
more
serious
matters
arising
between
one
member
of
the
ward
and
another
and
where
he
is
a
man
of
ability
and
influence
men
from
other
wards
bring
him
their
disputes
to
settle
when
he
so
settles
disputes
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
fee
which
however
is
not
so
much
as
would
be
payable
in
the
regular
court
of
the
king
or
chief
the
headman
is
naturally
an
important
member
of
his
company
and
often
is
a
captain
thereof
when
he
combines
the
two
offices
of
headman
and
captain
he
renders
to
the
community
a
very
important
service
for
in
times
of
war
where
the
members
of
the
ward
would
not
serve
cordially
under
a
stranger
they
would
in
all
cases
face
any
danger
with
their
own
kinsman
as
their
leader
the
headman
is
always
succeeded
by
his
uterine
brother
cousin
or
nephew
the
line
of
succession
that
is
to
say
following
the
customary
law
we
may
contrast
this
picture
with
the
more
warlike
bantus
of
southeast
africa
each
tribe
lived
by
itself
in
a
town
with
from
five
to
fifteen
thousand
inhabitants
surrounded
by
gardens
of
millet
beans
and
watermelon
beyond
these
roamed
their
cattle
sheep
and
goats
their
religion
was
ancestor
worship
with
sacrifice
to
spirits
and
the
dead
and
some
of
the
tribes
made
mummies
of
the
corpses
and
clothed
them
for
burial
they
wove
cloth
of
cotton
and
bark
they
carved
wood
and
built
walls
of
unhewn
stone
they
had
a
standing
military
organization
and
the
tribes
had
their
various
totems
so
that
they
were
known
as
the
men
of
iron
the
men
of
the
sun
the
men
of
the
serpents
sons
of
the
corn
cleaners
and
the
like
their
system
of
common
law
was
well
conceived

there
were
organized

justice
in
difficult
cases
precedents
were
sought

learned
antiquaries
consulted
at
the
age
of
fifteen

sixteen
the

the
land
was
owned
by

the
main
wealth
of

was

among

the

the

add

to

discredit

theory
that
there
is
any
such

as
an
aryan

the

negroes
have
a
saying
a
mist
lingers
on
the
swamps
so
lingers
the
love
of
father
and
mother
black
queens
have
often
ruled
african
tribes
among
the
we
are
told
women
take
part
in
public
assemblies
where
questions
are
discussed
the
system
of
educating
children
among
such
tribes
as
the
yoruba
is
worthy
of
emulation
by
many
more
civilized
peoples
close
knit
with
the
family
and
social
organization
comes
the
religious
life
of
the
negro
the
religion
of
africa
is
the
universal
animism
or
fetishism
of
primitive
peoples
rising
to
polytheism
and
approaching
monotheism
chiefly
but
not
wholly
as
a
result
of
christian
and
islamic
missions
of
fetishism
there
is
much
misapprehension
it
is
not
mere
senseless
degradation
it
is
a
philosophy
of
life
among
primitive
negroes
there
can
be
as
miss
kingsley
reminds
us
no
such
divorce
of
religion
from
practical
life
as
is
common
in
civilized
lands
religion
is
life
and
fetish
an
expression
of
the
practical
recognition
of
dominant
forces
in
which
the
negro
lives
to
him
all
the
world
is
spirit
miss
kingsley
says
if
you
want
for
example
to
understand
the
position
of
man
in
nature
according
to
fetish
there
is
as
far
as
i
know
no
clearer
statement
of
it
made
than
is
made
by
goethe
in
his
superb
fetish
is
a
severely
logical
way
of
accounting
for
the
world
in
terms
of
good
and
malignant
spirits
it
is
this
power
of
being
able
logically
to
account
for
everything
that
is
i
believe
at
the
back
of
the
tremendous
permanency
of
fetish
in
africa
and
the
cause
of
many
of
the
relapses
into
it
by
africans
converted
to
other
religions
it
is
also
the
explanation
of
the
fact
that
white
men
who
live
in
the
districts
where
death
and
danger
are
everyday
affairs
under
a
grim
pall
of
boredom
are
liable
to
believe
in
fetish
though
ashamed
of
so
doing
for
the
african
whose
mind
has
been
soaked
in
fetish
during
his
early
and
most
impressionable
years
the
voice
of
fetish
is
almost
irresistible
when
affliction
comes
to
him
ellis
tells
us
of
the
spirit
belief
of
the
ewe
people
who
believe
that
men
and
all
nature
have
the
indwelling
kra
which
is
immortal
that
the
man
himself
after
death
may
exist
as
a
ghost
which
is
often
conceived
of
as
departed
from
the
kra
a
shadowy
continuing
of
the
man
bryce
speaking
of
the
kaffirs
of
south
africa
says
to
the
kaffirs
as
to
the
most
savage
races
the
world
was
full
of
spirits
spirits
of
the
rivers
the
mountains
and
the
woods
most
important
were
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
who
had
power
to
injure
or
help
the
living
and
who
were
therefore
propitiated
by
offerings
at
stated
periods
as
well
as
on
occasions
when
their
aid
was
especially
desired
this
kind
of
worship
the
worship
once
most
generally
diffused
throughout
the
world
and
which
held
its
ground
among
the
greeks
and
italians
in
the
most
flourishing
period
of
ancient
civilization
as
it
does
in
china
and
japan
was
and
is
virtually
the
religion
of
the
kaffirs
african
religion
does
not
however
stop
with
fetish
but
as
in
the
case
of
other
peoples
tends
toward
polytheism
and
monotheism
among
the
yoruba
for
instance
frobenius
shows
that
religion
and
go
hand
in
hand
the
first
experienced
glance
will
here
detect
the
fact
that
this
nation
originally
possessed
a
clear
and
definite
organization
so
duly
ordered
and
so
logical
that
we
but
seldom
meet
with
its
like
among
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
and
the
basic
idea
of
every
clan
progeniture
is
a
powerful
god
the
legitimate
order
in
which
the
descendants
of
a
particular
clan
unite
in
marriage
to
found
new
families
the
essential
origin
of
every
babe
descent
in
the
founder
of
its
race
and
its
consideration
as
a
part
of
the
god
in
chief
the
security
with
which
the
newly
wedded
wife
not
only
may
but
should
minister
to
her
own
god
in
an
unfamiliar
home
the
yoruba
have
a
legend
of
a
dying
divinity
this
people
give
evidence
of
a
generalized
system
a
theocratic
scheme
a
perceptible
organization
reared
in
rhythmically
proportioned
manner

kingsley

great

forty
years

with

in
the
various

as
missionary
searching
after
their

therefore
being
allowed
a
deeper
entrance
into
the
arcana
of
their
soul
than
would
be
accorded
to
a

i
am
able
unhesitatingly
to
say
that
among
all
the
multitude
of
degraded
ones
with
whom
i
have
met
i
have
seen
or
heard
of
none
whose
religious
thought
was
only
a
superstition

in
the

surrounded
by
a
company
whom
their

has
courteously
summoned
at
my
request
when
i
say
to
him
have
come
to
speak
to
your
people
i
do
not
need
to
begin
by
telling
them
that
there
is
a

on
that
motley
assemblage
of

the

of
egyptian
religion
was
of
a
purely
nigritian
character
and
in
its

sudanese

next
the

cosmogony
of

races
third
the

of

the

religion
spreads
from
nubia
as
far
as
the
hausa
and
from
lake
chad
in
the
niger
as
far
as
the
yoruba
it
is
the
religion
of
possession
and
has
been
connected
by
some
with
asiatic
influences
from
without
have
come
two
great
religious
influences
islam
and
christianity
islam
came
by
conquest
trade
and
proselytism
as
a
conqueror
it
reached
egypt
in
the
seventh
century
and
had
by
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
firm
footing
in
the
egyptian
sudan
it
overran
the
central
sudan
by
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
had
swept
over
senegambia
and
the
whole
valley
of
the
niger
down
to
the
gulf
of
guinea
on
the
east
islam
approached
as
a
trader
in
the
eighth
century
it
spread
into
somaliland
and
overran
nubia
in
the
fourteenth
century
islam
dominates
africa
north
of
ten

north
latitude
and
is
strong
between
five
and
ten
degrees

in
the

it

the
victoria
nyanza
christianity
early
entered
africa
indeed
as
mommsen
says
it
was
through
africa
that
christianity
became
the
religion
of
the
world
tertullian
and
cyprian
were
from

arnobius
from
sicca
veneria
lactantius
and
probably
in
like
manner
minucius

in
spite
of
their
latin
names
were
natives
of
africa
and
not
less
so
augustine
in
africa
the
church
found
its
most
zealous
confessors
of
the
faith
and
its
most
gifted
defenders
the
africa
referred
to
here
however
was
not
negroland
but
africa
above
the
desert
where
negro
blood
was
represented
in
the
ancient
mediterranean
race
and
by
intercourse
across
the
desert
on
the
other
hand
christianity
was
early
represented
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
under
the
most
holy
pope
and
patriarch
of
the
great
city
of
alexandria
and
of
all
of
the
land
of
egypt
of
jerusalem
the
holy
city
of
nubia
abyssinia
and
pentapolis
and
all
the
preaching
of
st
mark
this
patriarchate
had
a
hundred
bishoprics
in
the
fourth
century
and
included
thousands
of
black
christians
through
it
the
cross
preceded
the
crescent
in
some
of
the
remotest
parts
of
black
africa
all
these
beginnings
were
gradually
overthrown
by
islam
except
among
the
copts
in
egypt
and
in
abyssinia
the
portuguese
in
the
sixteenth
century
began
to
replant
the
christian
religion
and
for
a
while
had
great
success
both
on
the
east
and
west
coasts
roman
catholic
enterprise
halted
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
protestants
began
the
west
coast
is
studded
with
english
and
german
missions
south
africa
is
largely
christian
through
french
and
english
influence
and
the
region
about
the
great
lakes
is
becoming
christianized
the
roman
catholics
have
lately
increased
their
activities
and
above
all
the
negroes
of
america
have
entered
with
their
own
churches
and
with
the
curiously
significant
ethiopian
movement
coming
now
to
other
spiritual
aspects
of
african
culture
we
can
speak
at
present
only
in
a
fragmentary
way
roughly
speaking
africa
can
be
divided
into
two
language
zones
north
of
the
fifth
degree
of
north
latitude
is
the
zone
of
diversity
with
at
least
a
hundred
groups
of
widely
divergent
languages
south
of
the
line
there
is
one
minor
language
spoken
by
less
than
fifty
thousand
people
and
elsewhere
the
predominant
bantu
tongue
with
its
various
dialects
spoken
by
at
least
fifty
million
the
bantu
tongue
which
thus
rules
all
central
west
and
south
africa
is
an
agglutinative
tongue
which
makes
especial
use
of
prefixes
the
hundreds
of
negro
tongues
or
dialects
in
the
north
represent
most
probably
the
result
of
war
and
migration
and
the
breaking
up
of
ancient
centers
of
culture
in
abyssinia
and
the
great
horn
of
east
africa
the
influence
of
semitic
tongues
is
noted
despite
much
effort
on
the
part
of
students
it
has
been
impossible
to
show
any
asiatic
origin
for
the
egyptian
language
as
sergi
maintains
everything
favors
an
african
origin
the
most
brilliant
suggestion
of
modern
days
links
together
the
egyptian
of
north
africa
and
the
hottentot
and
bushmen
tongues
of
south
africa
language
was
reduced
to
writing
among
the
egyptians
and
ethiopians
and
to
some
extent
elsewhere
in
africa
over
manuscripts
of
ethiopian
and
literature
are
extant
including
a
version
of
the
bible
and
historical
chronicles
the
arabic
was
used
as
the
written
tongue
of
the
sudan
and
negroland
has
given
us
in
this
tongue
many
chronicles
and
other
works
of
black
authors
the
greatest
of
these
the
epic
of
the
sudan
deserves
to
be
placed
among
the
classics
of
all
literature
in
other
parts
of
africa
there
was
no
written
language
but
there
was
on
the
other
hand
an
unusual
perfection
of
oral
tradition
through
bards
and
extraordinary
efficiency
in
telegraphy
by
drum
and
horn
the
folklore
and
proverbs
of
the
african
tribes
are
exceedingly
rich
some
of
these
have
been
made
familiar
to
english
writers
through
the
work
of
uncle
remus
others
have
been
collected
by
johnston
ellis
and
theal
a
black
bard
of
our
own
day
has
described
the
onslaught
of
the
matabili
in
poetry
of
singular
force
and
beauty
they
saw
the
clouds
ascend
from
the
plains
it
was
the
smoke
of
burning
towns
the
confusion
of
the
whirlwind
was
in
the
heart
of
the
great
chief
of
the
cattle
the
shout
was
raised
they
are
friends
but
they
shouted
again
they
are
foes
till
their
near
approach
proclaimed
them
matabili
the
men
seized
their
arms
and
rushed
out
as
if
to
chase
the
antelope
the
onset
was
as
the
voice
of
lightning
and
their
javelins
as
the
shaking
of
the
forest
in
the
autumn
storm
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
negro
deep
and
delicate
sense
of
beauty
in
form
color
and
sound
soyaux
says
of
african
industry
whoever
denies
to
them
independent
invention
and
individual
taste
in
their
work
either
shuts
his
eyes
intentionally
before
perfectly
evident
facts
or
lack
of
knowledge
renders
him
an
incompetent
judge
rutot
had
lately
told
us
how
the
negro
race
brought
art
and
sculpture
to
europe
the
bones
of
the
european
negroids
are
almost
without
exception
found
in
company
with
drawings
and
sculpture
in
high
and
low
relief
some
of
their
sculptures
like
the
wellendorff
venus
are
unusually
well
finished
for
primitive
man
so
too
the
painting
and
carving
of
the
bushmen
and
their
forerunners
in
south
africa
has
drawn
the
admiration
of
students
the
negro
has
been
prolific
in
the
invention
of
musical
instruments
and
has
given
a
new
and
original
music
to
the
western
world
schweinfurth
who
has
preserved
for
us
much
of
the
industrial
art
of
the
negroes
speaks
of
their
delight
in
the
production
of
works
of
art
for
the
embellishment
and
convenience
of
life
frobenius
expressed
his
astonishment
at
the
originality
of
the
african
in
the
yoruba
temple
which
he
visited
the
lofty
veranda
was
divided
from
the
passageway
by
fantastically
carved
and
colored
pillars
on
the
pillars
were
sculptured
knights
men
climbing
trees
women
gods
and
mythical
beings
the
dark
chamber
lying
beyond
showed
a
splendid
red
room
with
stone
hatchets
wooden
figures
cowry
beads
and
jars
the
whole
picture
the
columns
carved
in
colors
in
front
of
the
colored
altar
the
old
man
sitting
in
the
circle
of
those
who
reverenced
him
the
open
scaffolding
of
ninety
rafters
made
a
magnificent
impression
the
germans
have
found
in
kamarun
towns
built
castellated
and
fortified
in
a
manner
that
reminds
one
of
the
prehistoric
cities
of
crete
the
buildings
and
fortifications
of
zymbabwe
have
already
been
described
and
something
has
been
said
of
the
art
of
benin
with
its
brass
and
bronze
and
ivory
all
the
work
of
benin
in
bronze
and
brass
was
executed
by
casting
and
by
methods
so
complicated
that
it
would
be
no
easy
task
for
a
modern
european
craftsman
to
imitate
them
perhaps
no
race
has
shown
in
its
earlier
development
a
more
magnificent
art
impulse
than
the
negro
and
the
student
must
not
forget
how
far
negro
genius
entered
into
the
art
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
from
meroe
and
nepata
down
to
the
great
temples
of
egypt
frobenius
has
recently
directed
the
world
attention
to
art
in
west
africa
quartz
and
granite
he
found
treated
with
great
dexterity
but
more
magnificent
than
the
stone
monument
is
the
proof
that
at
some
remote
era
glass
was
made
and
molded
in
yorubaland
and
that
the
people
here
were
brilliant
in
the
production
of
images
the
great
mass
of
potsherds
lumps
of
glass
heaps
of
slag
proves
at
all
events
that
the
glass
industry
flourished
in
this
locality
in
ages
past
it
is
plain
that
the
glass
beads
found
to
have
been
so
very
common
in
africa
were
not
only
not
imported
but
were
actually
manufactured
in
great
quantities
at
home
the
pieces
are
remains
of
another
ancient
and
fine
type
of
art
and
were
eloquent
of
a
symmetry
a
vitality
a
delicacy
of
form
and
practically
a
reminiscence
of
the
ancient
greeks
the
antique
bronze
head
frobenius
describes
as
a
head
of
marvelous
beauty
wonderfully
cast
and
almost
equal
in
beauty
and
at
least
no
less
noble
in
form
and
as
ancient
as
the
heads
in
a
park
of
monuments
frobenius
saw
the
celebrated
forge
and
hammer
a
mighty
mass
of
iron
like
a
falling
drop
in
shape
and
a
block
of
quartz
fashioned
like
a
drum
frobenius
thinks
these
were
relics
dating
from
past
ages
of
culture
when
the
manipulation
of
quartz
and
granite
was
thoroughly
understood
and
when
iron
manipulation
gave
evidence
of
a
skill
not
met
with
even
when
we
contemplate
such
revolting
survivals
of
savagery
as
cannibalism
we
can
not
jump
too
quickly
at
conclusions
cannibalism
is
spread
over
many
parts
of
negro
africa
yet
the
very
tribes
who
practice
cannibalism
show
often
other
traits
of
industry
and
power
these
cannibal
bassonga
were
according
to
the
types
we
met
with
one
of
those
rare
nations
of
the
african
interior
which
can
be
classed
with
the
most
esthetic
and
skilled
most
discreet
and
intelligent
of
all
those
generally
known
to
us
as
the
natural
races
before
the
arabic
and
european
invasion
they
did
not
dwell
in
but
in
towns
with
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
inhabitants
in
towns
whose
highways
were
shaded
by
avenues
of
splendid
palms
planted
at
regular
intervals
and
laid
out
with
the
symmetry
of
colonnades
their
pottery
would
be
fertile
in
suggestion
to
every
art
craftsman
in
europe
their
weapons
of
iron
were
so
perfectly
fashioned
that
no
industrial
art
from
abroad
could
improve
upon
their
workmanship
the
iron
blades
were
cunningly
ornamented
with
damascened
copper
and
the
hilts
artistically
inlaid
with
the
same
metal
moreover
they
were
most
industrious
and
capable
husbandmen
whose
careful
tillage
of
the
suburbs
made
them
able
competitors
of
any
gardener
in
europe
their
sexual
and
parental
relations
evidenced
an
amount
of
tact
and
delicacy
of
feelings
unsurpassed
among
ourselves
either
in
the
simplicity
of
the
country
or
the
refinements
of
the
town
originally
their
political
and
municipal
system
was
organized
on
the
lines
of
a
representative
republic
true
it
is
on
record
that
these
towns
often
waged
an
internecine
warfare
but
in
spite
of
this
it
had
been
their
invariable
custom
from
time
immemorial
even
in
times
of
strife
to
keep
the
trade
routes
open
and
to
allow
their
own
and
foreign
merchants
to
go
their
ways
unharmed
and
the
commerce
of
these
nations
ebbed
and
flowed
along
a
road
of
unknown
age
running
from
itimbiri
to
batubenge
about
six
hundred
miles
in
length
this
highway
was
destroyed
by
the
of
civilization
from
arabia
only
toward
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
but
even
in
my
own
time
there
were
still
smiths
who
knew
the
names
of
places
along
that
wonderful
trade
route
driven
through
the
heart
of
the
forests
of
the
congo
for
every
scrap
of
imported
iron
was
carried
over
it
in
disposition
the
negro
is
among
the
most
lovable
of
men
practically
all
the
great
travelers
who
have
spent
any
considerable
time
in
africa
testify
to
this
and
pay
deep
tribute
to
the
kindness
with
which
they
were
received
one
has
but
to
remember
the
classic
story
of
mungo
park
the
strong
expressions
of
livingstone
the
words
of
stanley
and
hundreds
of
others
to
realize
this
ceremony
and
courtesy
mark
negro
life
livingstone
again
and
again
reminds
us
of
true
african
dignity
when
ilifian
men
or
women
salute
each
other
be
it
with
a
plain
and
easy
curtsey
which
is
here
the
simplest
form
adopted
or
kneeling
down
or
throwing
oneself
upon
the
ground
or
kissing
the
dust
with
one
forehead
no
matter
which
there
is
yet
a
deliberateness
a
majesty
a
dignity
a
devoted
earnestness
in
the
manner
of
its
doing
which
brings
to
light
with
every
gesture
with
every
fold
of
clothing
the
deep
significance
and
essential
import
of
every
single
action
everyone
may
without
too
greatly
straining
his
attention
notice
the
very
striking
precision
and
weight
with
which
the
upper
and
lower
native
classes
observe
these
niceties
of
intercourse
all
this
does
not
mean
that
the
african
negro
is
not
human
with
the
foibles
of
humanity
primitive
life
among
them
is
after
all
as
bare
and
cruel
as
among
primitive
germans
or
chinese
but
it
is
not
more
so
and
the
more
we
study
the
negro
the
more
we
realize
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
normal
human
stock
which
under
reasonable
conditions
has
developed
and
will
develop
in
the
same
lines
as
other
men
why
is
it
then
that
so
much
of
misinformation
and
contempt
is
widespread
concerning
africa
and
its
people
not
simply
among
the
unthinking
mass
but
among
men
of
education
and
knowledge
one
reason
lies
undoubtedly
in
the
connotation
of
the
term
negro
in
north
america
a
negro
may
be
white
since
the
term
refers
to
any
person
of
negro
descent
if
we
use
the
term
in
the
same
sense
concerning
the
inhabitants
of
the
rest
of
world
we
may
say
truthfully
that
negroes
have
been
among
the
leaders
of
civilization
in
every
age
of
the
world
history
from
ancient
babylon
to
modern
america
that
they
have
contributed
wonderful
gifts
in
art
industry
political
organization
and
religion
and
that
they
are
doing
the
same
in
all
parts
of
the
world
in
sharp
contrast
to
this
usage
the
term
negro
in
africa
has
been
more
and
more
restricted
until
some
scientists
late
in
the
last
century
declared
that
the
great
mass
of
the
black
and
brown
people
of
africa
were
not
negroes
at
all
and
that
the
real
negro
dwells
in
a
small
space
between
the
niger
and
the
senegal
ratzel
says
if
we
ask
what
justifies
so
narrow
a
limitation
we
find
that
the
hideous
negro
type
which
the
fancy
of
observers
once
saw
all
over
africa
but
which
as
livingstone
says
is
really
to
be
seen
only
as
a
sign
in
front
of
tobacco
shops
has
on
closer
inspection
evaporated
from
all
parts
of
africa
to
settle
no
one
knows
how
in
just
this
region
if
we
understand
that
an
extreme
case
may
have
been
taken
for
the
genuine
and
pure
form
even
so
we
do
not
comprehend
the
ground
of
its
geographical
limitation
and
location
for
wherever
dark
men
dwell
this
ugly
type
also
crops
up
we
are
here
in
the
presence
of
a
refinement
of
science
which
to
an
unprejudiced
eye
will
hardly
hold
water
in
this
restricted
sense
the
negro
has
no
history
culture
or
ability
for
the
simple
fact
that
such
human
beings
as
have
history
and
evidence
culture
and
ability
are
not
negroes
between
these
two
extreme
definitions
with
unconscious
adroitness
the
most
extraordinary
and
contradictory
conclusions
have
been
reached
let
it
therefore
be
said
once
for
all
that
racial
inferiority
is
not
the
cause
of
prejudice
boaz
the
anthropologist
says
an
unbiased
estimate
of
the
anthropological
evidence
so
far
brought
forward
does
not
permit
us
to
countenance
the
belief
in
a
racial
inferiority
which
would
unfit
an
individual
of
the
negro
race
to
take
his
part
in
modern
civilization
we
do
not
know
of
any
demand
made
on
the
human
body
or
mind
in
modern
life
that
anatomical
or
ethnological
evidence
would
prove
to
be
beyond
the
powers
of
the
negro
we
have
every
reason
to
suppose
that
all
races
are
capable
under
proper
guidance
of
being
fitted
into
the
complex
scheme
of
our
modern
civilization
and
the
policy
of
artificially
excluding
them
from
its
benefits
is
as
unjustifiable
scientifically
as
it
is
ethically
abhorrent
what
is
then
this
instinctive
modern
prejudice
against
black
folk
lord
bryce
says
of
the
intermingling
of
blacks
and
whites
in
south
america
the
ease
with
which
the
spaniards
have
intermingled
by
marriage
with
the
indian
tribes
and
the
portuguese
have
done
the
like
not
only
with
the
indians
but
with
the
more
physically
dissimilar
negroes
shows
that
race
repugnance
is
no
such
constant
and
permanent
factor
in
human
affairs
as
members
of
the
teutonic
peoples
are
apt
to
assume
instead
of
being
as
we
teutons
suppose
the
rule
in
the
matter
we
are
rather
the
exception
for
in
the
ancient
world
there
seems
to
have
been
little
race
repulsion
in
nearly
every
age
and
land
men
of
negro
descent
have
distinguished
themselves

egypt
enslaved

and
if
there
were
more

than

among

there
were
also
more
blacks
among
her
nobles
and
pharaohs
and
both
facts
are
explained
by
her
racial
origin
and
geographical
position
the
fall
of
rome
led
to
a
cessation
of
the
slave
trade
but
after
a
long
interval
came
the
white
slave
trade
of
the
saracens
and
moors
and
finally
the
modern
trade
in
negroes
slavery
as
it
exists
universally
among
primitive
people
is
a
system
whereby
captives
in
war
are
put
to
tasks
about
the
homes
and
in
the
fields
thus
releasing
the
warriors
for
systematic
fighting
and
the
women
for
leisure
such
slavery
has
been
common
among
all
peoples
and
was
in
africa
the
relative
number
of
african
slaves
under
these
conditions
was
small
and
the
labor
not
hard
they
were
members
of
the
family
and
might
and
did
often
rise
to
high
position
in
the
tribe
remembering
that
in
the
fifteenth
century
there
was
no
great
disparity
between
the
civilization
of
negroland
and
that
of
europe
what
made
the
striking
difference
in
subsequent
development
european
civilization
cut
off
by
physical
barriers
from
further
incursions
of
barbaric
races
settled
more
and
more
to
systematic
industry
and
to
the
domination
of
one
religion
african
culture
and
industries
were
threatened
by
powerful
barbarians
from
the
west
and
central
regions
of
the
continent
and
by
the
moors
in
the
north
and
islam
had
only
partially
converted
the
leading
peoples
when
therefore
a
demand
for
workmen
arose
in
america
european
exportation
was
limited
by
religious
ties
and
economic
stability
african
exportation
was
encouraged
not
simply
by
the
christian
attitude
toward
heathen
but
also
by
the
moslem
enmity
toward
the
unconverted
negroes
two
great
modern
religions
therefore
agreed
at
least
in
the
policy
of
enslaving
heathen
blacks
while
the
overthrow
of
black
askias
by
the
moors
at
tenkadibou
brought
that
economic
chaos
among
the
advanced
negro
peoples
and
movement
among
the
more
barbarous
tribes
which
proved
of
prime
advantage
to
the
development
of
a
systematic
trade
in
men
the
modern
slave
trade
began
with
the
mohammedan
conquests
in
africa
when
heathen
negroes
were
seized
to
supply
the
harems
and
as
soldiers
and
servants
they
were
bought
from
the
masters
and
seized
in
war
until
the
growing
wealth
and
luxury
of
the
conquerors
demanded
larger
numbers
then
negroes
from
the
egyptian
sudan
abyssinia
and
zanzibar
began
to
pass
into
arabia
persia
and
india
in
increased
numbers
as
negro
kingdoms
and
tribes
rose
to
power
they
found
the
slave
trade
lucrative
and
natural
since
the
raids
in
which
slaves
were
captured
were
ordinary
wars
it
was
not
until
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
that
the
demand
for
slaves
in
christian
lands
made
slaves
the
object
and
not
the
incident
of
african
wars
in
mohammedan
countries
there
were
gleams
of
hope
in
slavery
in
fiction
and
in
truth
the
black
slave
had
a
chance
once
converted
to
islam
he
became
a
brother
to
the
best
and
the
brotherhood
of
the
faith
was
not
the
sort
of
idle
lie
that
christian
slave
masters
made
it
in
arabia
black
leaders
arose
like
antar
in
india
black
slaves
carved
out
principalities
where
their
descendants
still
rule
some
negro
slaves
were
brought
to
europe
by
the
spaniards
in
the
fourteenth
century
and
a
small
trade
was
continued
by
the
portuguese
who
conquered
territory
from
the
tawny
moors
of
north
africa
in
the
early
fifteenth
century
later
after
their
severe
repulse
at
the
portuguese
began
to
creep
down
the
west
coast
in
quest
of
trade
they
reached
the
river
of
gold
in
and
their
story
is
that
their
leader
seized
certain
free
moors
and
the
next
year
exchanged
them
for
ten
black
slaves
a
target
of
hide
ostrich
eggs
and
some
gold
dust
the
trade
was
easily
justified
on
the
ground
that
the
moors
were
mohammedans
and
refused
to
be
converted
to
christianity
while
heathen
negroes
would
be
better
subjects
for
conversion
and
stronger
laborers
in
the
next
few
years
a
small
number
of
negroes
continued
to
be
imported
into
spain
and
portugal
as
servants
we
find
for
instance
in
that
negro
slaves
were
common
in
seville
there
is
a
letter
from
ferdinand
and
isabella
in
the
year
to
a
celebrated
negro
juan
de
valladolid
commonly
called
the
negro
count
el
conde
negro
nominating
him
to
the
office
of
mayoral
of
the
negroes
in
seville
the
slaves
were
apparently
treated
kindly
allowed
to
keep
their
own
dances
and
festivals
and
to
have
their
own
chief
who
represented
them
in
the
courts
as
against
their
own
masters
and
settled
their
private
quarrels
between
and
little
mention
is
made
of
slaves
in
the
trade
with
africa
columbus
is
said
to
have
suggested
negroes
for
america
but
ferdinand
and
isabella
refused
nevertheless
by
we
have
the
first
incidental
mention
of
negroes
going
to
america
in
a
declaration
that
negro
slaves
born
in
the
power
of
christians
were
to
be
allowed
to
pass
to
the
indies
and
the
officers
of
the
royal
revenue
were
to
receive
the
money
to
be
paid
for
their
permits
about
ovando
governor
of
spanish
america
was
objecting
to
negro
slaves
and
solicited
that
no
negro
slaves
should
be
sent
to
hispaniola
for
they
fled
amongst
the
indians
and
taught
them
bad
customs
and
never
could
be
captured
nevertheless
a
letter
from
the
king
to
ovando
dated
segovia
the
fifteenth
of
september
says
i
will
send
more
negro
slaves
as
you
request
i
think
there
may
be
a
hundred
at
each
time
a
trustworthy
person
will
go
with
them
who
may
have
some
share
in
the
gold
they
may
collect
and
may
promise
them
ease
if
they
work
well
there
is
a
record
of
a
hundred
slaves
being
sent
out
this
very
year
and
diego
columbus
was
notified
of
fifty
to
be
sent
from
seville
for
the
mines
in
after
this
time
frequent
notices
show
that
negroes
were
common
in
the
new
world
when
pizarro
for
instance
had
been
slain
in
peru
his
body
was
dragged
to
the
cathedral
by
two
negroes
after
the
battle
of
anaquito
the
head
of
the
viceroy
was
cut
off
by
a
negro
and
during
the
great
earthquake
in
guatemala
a
most
remarkable
figure
was
a
gigantic
negro
seen
in
various
parts
of
the
city
nunez
had
thirty
negroes
with
him
on
the
top
of
the
sierras
and
there
was
rumor
of
an
aboriginal
tribe
of
negroes
in
south
america
one
of
the
last
acts
of
king
ferdinand
was
to
urge
that
no
more
negroes
be
sent
to
the
west
indies
but
under
charles
v
bishop
las
casas
drew
up
a
plan
of
assisted
migration
to
america
and
asked
in
the
right
for
immigrants
to
import
twelve
negro
slaves
in
return
for
which
the
indians
were
to
be
freed
las
casas
writing
in
his
old
age
owns
his
error
this
advice
that
license
should
be
given
to
bring
negro
slaves
to
these
lands
the
clerigo
casas
first
gave
not
considering
the
injustice
with
which
the
portuguese
take
them
and
make
them
slaves
which
advice
after
he
had
apprehended
the
nature
of
the
thing
he
would
not
have
given
for
all
he
had
in
the
world
for
he
always
held
that
they
had
been
made
slaves
unjustly
and
tyrannically
for
the
same
reason
holds
good
of
them
as
of
the
indians
as
soon
as
the
plan
was
broached
a
savoyard
lorens
de
gomenot
governor
of
bresa
obtained
a
monopoly
of
this
proposed
trade
and
shrewdly
sold
it
to
the
genoese
for
thousand
ducats
other
monopolies
were
granted
in
and
thus
the
american
trade
became
established
and
gradually
grew
passing
successively
into
the
hands
of
the
portuguese
the
dutch
the
french
and
the
english
at
first
the
trade
was
of
the
same
kind
and
volume
as
that
already
passing
northward
over
the
desert
routes
soon
however
the
american
trade
developed
a
strong
unchecked
demand
for
brute
labor
in
the
west
indies
and
on
the
continent
of
america
grew
until
it
culminated
in
the
eighteenth
century
when
negro
slaves
were
crossing
the
atlantic
at
the
rate
of
fifty
to
one
hundred
thousand
a
year
this
called
for
slave
raiding
on
a
scale
that
drew
upon
every
part
of
africa
upon
the
west
coast
the
western
and
egyptian
sudan
the
valley
of
the
congo
abyssinia
the
lake
regions
the
east
coast
and
madagascar
not
simply
the
degraded
and
weaker
types
of
negroes
were
seized
but
the
strong
bantu
the
mandingo
and
songhay
the
nubian
and
nile
negroes
the
fula
and
even
the
asiatic
malay
were
represented
in
the
raids
there
was
thus
begun
in
modern
days
a
new
slavery
and
slave
trade
it
was
different
from
that
of
the
past
because
more
and
more
it
came
in
time
to
be
founded
on
racial
caste
and
this
caste
was
made
the
foundation
of
a
new
industrial
system
for
four
hundred
years
from
to
european
civilization
carried
on
a
systematic
trade
in
human
beings
of
such
tremendous
proportions
that
the
physical
economic
and
moral
effects
are
still
plainly
to
be
remarked
throughout
the
world
to
this
must
be
added
the
large
slave
trade
of
mussulman
lands
which
began
with
the
seventh
century
and
raged
almost
unchecked
until
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
these
were
not
days
of
decadence
but
a
period
that
gave
the
world
shakespeare
martin
luther
and
raphael
and
abraham
lincoln
it
was
the
day
of
the
greatest
expansion
of
two
of
the
most
pretentious
religions
and
of
the
beginnings
of
the
modern
organization
of
industry
in
the
midst
of
this
advance
and
uplift
this
slave
trade
and
slavery
spread
more
human
misery
inculcated
more
disrespect
for
and
neglect
of
humanity
a
greater
callousness
to
suffering
and
more
petty
cruel
human
hatred
than
can
well
be
calculated
we
may
excuse
and
palliate
it
and
write
history
so
as
to
let
men
forget
it
it
remains
the
most
inexcusable
and
despicable
blot
on
modern
human
history
the
portuguese
built
the
first
fort
at
elmina
on
the
gold
coast
in
and
extended
their
trade
down
the
west
coast
and
up
the
east
coast
under
them
the
abominable
traffic
grew
larger
and
larger
until
it
became
far
the
most
important
in
money
value
of
all
the
commerce
of
the
zambesi
basin
there
could
be
no
extension
of
agriculture
no
mining
no
progress
of
any
kind
where
it
was
so
extensively
carried
on
it
was
the
dutch
however
who
launched
the
oversea
slave
trade
as
a
regular
institution
they
began
their
fight
for
freedom
from
spain
in
in
as
a
war
measure
against
spain
who
at
that
time
was
dominating
portugal
they
made
their
first
voyage
to
guinea
by
they
had
captured
portugal
various
slave
forts
on
the
west
coast
and
they
proceeded
to
open
sixteen
forts
along
the
coast
of
the
gulf
of
guinea
ships
sailed
from
holland
to
africa
got
slaves
in
exchange
for
their
goods
carried
the
slaves
to
the
west
indies
or
brazil
and
returned
home
laden
with
sugar
in
the
private
companies
trading
in
the
west
were
all
merged
into
the
dutch
west
india
company
which
sent
in
four
years
fifteen
thousand
four
hundred
and
thirty
negroes
to
brazil
carried
on
war
with
spain
supplied
even
the
english
plantations
and
gradually
became
the
great
slave
carrier
of
the
day
the
commercial
supremacy
of
the
dutch
early
excited
the
envy
and
emulation
of
the
english
the
navigation
ordinance
of
was
aimed
at
them
and
two
wars
were
necessary
to
wrest
the
slave
trade
from
them
and
place
it
in
the
hands
of
the
english
the
final
terms
of
peace
among
other
things
surrendered
new
netherlands
to
england
and
opened
the
way
for
england
to
become
henceforth
the
world
greatest
slave
trader
the
english
trade
began
with
sir
john
hawkins
voyages
in
and
later
in
which
the
jesus
our
chiefe
shippe
played
a
leading
part
desultory
trade
was
kept
up
by
the
english
until
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
when
english
chartered
companies
began
to
appear
in
the
royal
adventurers
including
the
king
the
queen
dowager
and
the
duke
of
york
invested
in
the
trade
and
finally
the
royal
african
company
which
became
the
world
chief
slave
trader
was
formed
in
and
carried
on
a
growing
trade
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
jamaica
had
finally
been
captured
and
held
by
oliver
cromwell
in
and
formed
a
west
indian
base
for
the
trade
in
men
the
chief
contract
for
trade
in
negroes
was
the
celebrated
asiento
or
agreement
of
the
king
of
spain
to
the
importation
of
slaves
into
spanish
domains
the
pope
bull
or
demarkation
debarred
spain
from
african
possessions
and
compelled
her
to
contract
with
other
nations
for
slaves
this
contract
was
in
the
hands
of
the
portuguese
in
in
the
dutch
received
it
and
in
the
french
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
brought
this
monopoly
to
england
this
asiento
of
was
an
agreement
between
england
and
spain
by
which
the
latter
granted
the
former
a
monopoly
of
the
spanish
colonial
slave
trade
for
thirty
years
and
england
engaged
to
supply
the
colonies
within
that
time
with
at
least
one
hundred
and
thousand
slaves
at
the
rate
of
hundred
per
year
the
english
counted
this
prize
as
the
greatest
result
of
the
treaty
of
utrecht
which
ended
the
mighty
struggle
against
the
power
of
louis
xiv
the
english
held
the
monopoly
until
the
treaty
of
although
they
had
to
go
to
war
over
it
in
from
this
agreement
the
slave
traders
reaped
a
harvest
the
trade
centered
at
liverpool
and
that
city
commercial
greatness
was
built
largely
on
this
foundation
in
it
sent
out
one
slaver
of
thirty
tons
burden
encouraged
by
parliamentary
subsidies
which
amounted
to
nearly
half
a
million
dollars
between
and
the
trade
amounted
to
ships
in
in
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
one
hundred
and
which
carried
thousand
two
hundred
and
thirteen
slaves
in
one
year
the
slave
trade
thus
begun
by
the
portuguese
enlarged
by
the
dutch
and
carried
to
its
culmination
by
the
english
centered
on
the
west
coast
near
the
seat
of
perhaps
the
oldest
and
most
interesting
culture
of
africa
it
came
at
a
critical
time
the
culture
of
yoruba
benin
mossiland
and
nupe
had
exhausted
itself
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
stem
the
flood
of
mohammedan
culture
it
has
succeeded
in
maintaining
its
small
loosely
federated
suited
to
trade
industry
and
art
it
had
developed
strong
resistance
toward
the
sudan
state
builders
toward
the
north
as
in
the
case
of
the
fighting
mossi
but
behind
this
warlike
resistance
lay
the
peaceful
city
life
which
gave
industrial
ideas
to
byzantium
and
shared
something
of
ethiopian
and
mediterranean
culture
the
first
advent
of
the
slave
traders
increased
and
encouraged
native
industry
as
is
evidenced
by
the
bronze
work
of
benin
but
soon
this
was
pushed
into
the
background
for
it
was
not
bronze
metal
but
bronze
flesh
that
europe
wanted
a
new
tyranny
cruel
and
built
on
war
forced
itself
forward
in
the
niger
delta
the
powerful
state
of
dahomey
arose
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
became
a
devastating
tyranny
reaching
its
highest
power
early
in
the
nineteenth
century
ashanti
a
similar
kingdom
began
its
conquests
in
and
grew
with
the
slave
trade
thus
state
building
in
west
africa
began
to
replace
the
city
economy
but
it
was
a
state
built
on
war
and
on
war
supported
and
encouraged
largely
for
the
sake
of
trade
in
human
flesh
the
native
industries
were
changed
and
disorganized
family
ties
and
government
were
weakened
far
into
the
heart
of
africa
this
devilish
disintegration
coupled
with
christian
rum
and
mohammedan
raiding
penetrated
the
face
of
africa
was
turned
south
on
these
slave
traders
instead
of
northward
toward
the
mediterranean
where
for
two
thousand
years
and
more
europe
and
africa
had
met
in
legitimate
trade
and
mutual
respect
the
full
significance
of
the
battle
of
tenkadibou
which
overthrew
the
askias
was
now
clear
hereafter
africa
for
centuries
was
to
appear
before
the
world
not
as
the
land
of
gold
and
ivory
of
mansa
musa
and
meroe
but
as
a
bound
and
captive
slave
dumb
and
degraded
the
natural
desire
to
avoid
a
painful
subject
has
led
historians
to
gloss
over
the
details
of
the
slave
trade
and
leave
the
impression
that
it
was
a
local
phenomenon
and
confined
to
a
few
years
it
was
on
the
contrary
continent
wide
and
centuries
long
and
an
economic
social
and
political
catastrophe
probably
unparalleled
in
human
history
the
exact
proportions
of
the
slave
trade
can
be
estimated
only
approximately
from
to
we
know
that
the
english
african
company
alone
sent
ships
to
africa
shipped
there
negro
slaves
and
after
losing
on
the
middle
passage
delivered
in
america
it
seems
probable
that
negroes
a
year
arrived
in
america
between
and
after
the
asiento
of
this
number
rose
to
annually
and
before
the
revolutionary
war
it
had
reached
at
least
and
perhaps
slaves
a
year
the
total
number
of
slaves
imported
is
not
known
dunbar
estimates
that
nearly
came
to
america
in
the
sixteenth
century
in
the
seventeenth
in
the
eighteenth
and
over
in
the
nineteenth
perhaps
in
all
certainly
it
seems
that
at
least
negroes
were
expatriated
probably
every
slave
imported
represented
on
the
average
five
corpses
in
africa
or
on
the
high
seas
the
american
slave
trade
therefore
meant
the
elimination
of
at
least
negroes
from
their
fatherland
the
mohammedan
slave
trade
meant
the
expatriation
or
forcible
migration
in
africa
of
nearly
as
many
more
it
would
be
conservative
then
to
say
that
the
slave
trade
cost
negro
africa
souls
and
yet
people
ask
the
cause
of
the
stagnation
of
culture
in
that
land
since
such
a
large
number
of
slaves
could
be
supplied
only
by
organized
slave
raiding
in
every
corner
of
africa
the
african
continent
gradually
became
revolutionized
whole
regions
were
depopulated
whole
tribes
disappeared
villages
were
built
in
caves
and
on
hills
or
in
forest
fastnesses
the
character
of
peoples
like
those
of
benin
developed
their
worst
excesses
of
cruelty
instead
of
the
already
flourishing
arts
of
peace
the
dark
irresistible
grasp
of
fetish
took
firmer
hold
on
men
minds
further
advances
toward
civilization
became
impossible
not
only
was
there
the
immense
demand
for
slaves
which
had
its
outlet
on
the
west
coast
but
the
slave
caravans
were
streaming
up
through
the
desert
to
the
mediterranean
coast
and
down
the
valley
of
the
nile
to
the
centers
of
mohammedanism
it
was
a
rape
of
a
continent
to
an
extent
never
paralleled
in
ancient
or
modern
times
in
the
american
trade
there
was
not
only
the
horrors
of
the
slave
raid
which
lined
the
winding
paths
of
the
african
jungles
with
bleached
bones
but
there
was
also
the
horrors
of
what
was
called
the
middle
passage
that
is
the
voyage
across
the
atlantic
as
sir
william
dolben
said
the
negroes
were
chained
to
each
other
hand
and
foot
and
stowed
so
close
that
they
were
not
allowed
above
a
foot
and
a
half
for
each
in
breadth
thus
crammed
together
like
herrings
in
a
barrel
they
contracted
putrid
and
fatal
disorders
so
that
they
who
came
to
inspect
them
in
a
morning
had
occasionally
to
pick
dead
slaves
out
of
their
rows
and
to
unchain
their
carcases
from
the
bodies
of
their
wretched
to
whom
they
had
been
fastened
it
was
estimated
that
out
of
every
one
hundred
lot
shipped
from
africa
only
about
fifty
lived
to
be
effective
laborers
across
the
sea
and
among
the
whites
more
seamen
died
in
that
trade
in
one
year
than
in
the
whole
remaining
trade
of
england
in
two
the
full
realization
of
the
horrors
of
the
slave
trade
was
slow
in
reaching
the
ears
and
conscience
of
the
modern
world
just
as
the
treatment
of
dark
natives
in
european
colonies
is
brought
to
publicity
with
the
greatest
difficulty
the
first
move
against
the
slave
trade
in
england
came
in
parliament
in
but
it
was
not
until
years
later
in
that
the
trade
was
banned
through
the
arduous
labors
of
clarkson
wilberforce
sharpe
and
others
denmark
had
already
abolished
the
trade
and
the
united
states
attempted
to
do
so
the
following
year
portugal
and
spain
were
induced
to
abolish
the
trade
between
and
notwithstanding
these
laws
the
contraband
trade
went
on
until
the
beginning
of
the
civil
war
in
america
the
reasons
for
this
were
the
enormous
profit
of
the
trade
and
the
continued
demand
of
the
american
slave
barons
who
had
no
sympathy
with
the
efforts
to
stop
their
source
of
cheap
labor
supply
however
philanthropy
was
not
working
alone
to
overthrow
negro
slavery
and
the
slave
trade
it
was
seen
first
in
england
and
later
in
other
countries
that
slavery
as
an
industrial
system
could
not
be
made
to
work
satisfactorily
in
modern
times
its
cost
was
too
great
and
one
of
the
causes
of
this
cost
was
the
slave
insurrections
from
the
very
beginning
when
the
slaves
rose
on
the
plantation
of
diego
columbus
down
to
the
civil
war
in
america
actual
and
potential
slave
insurrection
in
the
west
indies
in
north
and
south
america
kept
the
slave
owners
in
apprehension
and
turmoil
or
called
for
a
police
system
difficult
to
maintain
in
north
america
revolt
finally
took
the
form
of
organized
running
away
to
the
north
and
this
with
the
growing
scarcity
of
suitable
land
and
the
moral
revolt
led
to
the
civil
war
and
the
disappearance
of
the
american
slave
trade
there
was
still
however
the
mohammedan
slave
trade
to
deal
with
and
this
has
been
the
work
of
the
nineteenth
and
early
twentieth
centuries
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
ten
thousand
slaves
annually
were
being
distributed
on
the
southern
and
eastern
coast
of
the
mediterranean
and
at
the
great
slave
market
in
bornu
on
the
east
coast
of
africa
in
nineteen
thousand
slaves
were
passed
into
zanzibar
and
thence
into
arabia
and
persia
as
late
as
three
thousand
annually
were
being
thus
transplanted
but
now
the
trade
is
about
stopped
the
only
centers
of
actual
slave
trading
may
be
said
to
be
the
cocoa
plantations
of
the
portuguese
islands
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
and
the
congo
free

such
is
the
story
of
the

of

the

it

that
with

arose
at

the

of
the
modern

the
costliest
for

was
built

is

according

some
accounts
alonzo
the
negro
piloted
one
of
the
ships
of
columbus
and
certainly
there
was
negro
blood
among
his
sailors
as
early
as
there
were
nearly
ten
thousand
negroes
in
the
new
world
we
hear
of
them
in

in

a
negro
is
sent

to

were

fought

were

this
stephen

was
sent
ahead
by
certain
spanish
friars
to
the
seven
cities
of
cibola
as
soon
as
stephen
had
left
said
friars
he
determined
to
earn
all
the
reputation
and
honor
for
himself
and
that
the
boldness
and
daring
of
having
alone
discovered
those
villages
of
high
stories
so
much
spoken
of
throughout
that
country
should
be
attributed
to
him
and
carrying
along
with
him
the
people
who
followed
him
he
endeavored
to
cross
the
wilderness
which
is
between
cibola
and
the
country
he
had
gone
through
and
he
was
so
far
ahead
of
the
friars
that
when
they
arrived
at
chichilticalli
which
is
on
the
edge
of
the
wilderness
he
was
already
at
cibola
which
is
eighty
leagues
of
wilderness
beyond
but
the
indians
of
the
new
and
strange
country
took
alarm
and
concluded
that
stephen
must
be
a
spy
or
guide
for
some
nations
who
intended
to
come
and
conquer
them
because
it
seemed
to
them
unreasonable
for
him
to

that
the

slaves
began

joined
many
of

to
various
parts
of

the
slave

greatly
increased
in

of

and
after
the
revolution
in
hayti
large
numbers
of
french
emigrants
from
that
island
settled
in

this
and
spanish
greed
increased
the
harshness
of

and
eventually
led
to
revolt
among
the

persecution
of
the

in

broke
out

demanded
the
abolition

the

was
cruel

bloody

ended

secured

continued

as

with
large

was
the
freeing
of

by

of

negro

played
here
a
leading

brazil
was
the
center
of
portuguese
slavery
but
slaves
were
not
introduced
in
large
numbers
until
about
when
diamonds
were
discovered
in
the
territory
above
rio
janeiro
gradually
the
seaboard
from
pernambuco
to
rio
janeiro
and
beyond
became
filled
with
negroes
and
although
the
slave
trade
north
of
the
equator
was
theoretically
abolished
by
portugal
in
and
south
of
the
equator
in
and
by
brazil
in
these
regions
in
and
nevertheless
between
and
over
a
million
and
a
quarter
of
negroes
were
introduced
not
until
brazil
abolished
slavery
in
did
the
importation
wholly
cease
brazilian
slavery
allowed
the
slave
to
purchase
his
freedom
and
the
color
line
was
not
strict
even
in
the
eighteenth
century
there
were
black
clergy
and
bishops
indeed
the
negro
clergy
seem
to
have
been
on
a
higher
moral
level
than
the
whites
insurrection
was
often
attempted
especially
among
the
mohammedan
negroes
around
bahia
in
a
tribe
of
revolted
slaves
held
out
for
a
long
time
in
a
widespread
conspiracy
failed
but
many
of
the
leaders
fled
to
the
forest
in
a
thousand
rose
in
revolt
at
bahia
and
again
in
from
to
revolt
was
in
the
air
and
in
came
the
great
revolt
of
the
mohammedans
who
attempted
to
enthrone
a
queen
the
negroes
fought
with
furious
bravery
but
were
finally
defeated
by
the
number
of
free
negroes
had
very
greatly
increased
so
that
emancipation
did
not
come
as
a
shock
while
mohammedan
negroes
still
gave
trouble
and
were
in
some
cases
sent
back
to
africa
yet
on
the
whole
emancipation
was
peaceful
and
whites
negroes
and
indians
are
amalgamating
into
a
new
race
at
the
present
moment
there
is
scarcely
a
lowly
or
a
highly
placed
federal
or
provincial
official
at
the
head
of
or
within
any
of
the
great
departments
of
state
that
has
not
more
or
less
negro
or
blood
in
his
veins
lord
bryce
says
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
along
the
coast
from
rio
to
bahia
and
pernambuco
as
well
as
in
parts
of
the
interior
behind
these
two
cities
the
black
population
predominates
the
brazilian
lower
class
intermarries
freely
with
the
black
people
the
brazilian
middle
class
intermarries
with
mulattoes
and
quadroons
brazil
is
the
one
country
in
the
world
besides
the
portuguese
colonies
on
the
east
and
west
coasts
of
africa
in
which
a
fusion
of
the
european
and
african
races
is
proceeding
unchecked
by
law
or
custom
the
doctrines
of
human
equality
and
human
solidarity
have
here
their
perfect
work
the
result
is
so
far
satisfactory
that
there
is
little
or
no
class
friction
the
white
man
does
not
lynch
or
maltreat
the
negro
indeed
i
have
never
heard
of
a
lynching
anywhere
in
south
america
except
occasionally
as
part
of
a
political
convulsion
the
negro
is
not
accused
of
insolence
and
does
not
seem
to
develop
any
more
criminality
than
naturally
belongs
to
any
ignorant
population
with
loose
notions
of
morality
and
property
what
ultimate
effect
the
intermixture
of
blood
will
have
on
the
european
element
in
brazil
i
will
not
venture
to
predict
if
one
may
judge
from
a
few
remarkable
cases
it
will
not
necessarily
reduce
the
intellectual
standard
one
of

ablest
and
most
refined

have
known
had
some
color

other
such
cases

assumptions
and
preconceptions
must
be
eschewed
however
plausible
they

a

the

in

notorious
and
far
from
inconsiderable
they
played
the
chief
part
during
many
years
in
brazil
in
the
campaign
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
i
could
quote
celebrated
names
of
more
than
one
of
these
who
put
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
literary
movement
they
fought
with
firmness
and
intrepidity
in
the
press
and
on
the
platform
they
faced
with
courage
the
gravest
perils
to
which
they
were
exposed
in
their
struggle
against
the
powerful
slave
owners
who
had
the
protection
of
a
conservative
government
they
gave
evidence
of
sentiments
of
patriotism
and
appreciation
during
the
long
campaign
in
paraguay
fighting
heroically
at
the
boarding
of
the
ships
in
the
naval
battle
of
riachuelo
and
in
the
attacks
on
the
brazilian
army
on
numerous
occasions
in
the
course
of
this
long
south
american
war
it
was
owing
to
their
support
that
the
republic
was
erected
on
the
ruins
of
the
empire
the
dutch
brought
the
first
slaves
to
the
north
american
continent
john
rolfe
relates
that
the
last
of
august
there
came
to
virginia
a
dutch
man
of
warre
that
sold
us
twenty
negars
this
was
probably
one
of
the
ships
of
the
numerous
private
dutch
trading
companies
which
early
entered
into
the
developed
and
the
lucrative
african
slave
trade
although
the
dutch
thus
commenced
the
continental
slave
trade
they
did
not
actually
furnish
a
very
large
number
of
slaves
to
the
english
colonies
outside
the
west
indies
a
small
trade
had
by
brought
a
few
thousand
to
new
york
and
still
fewer
to
new
jersey
the
dutch
found
better
scope
for
slaves
in
guiana
which
they
settled
in
sugar
cane
became
the
staple
crop
but
the
negroes
early
began
to
revolt
and
the
dutch
brought
in
east
indian
coolies
the
slaves
were
badly
treated
and
the
runaways
joined
the
revolted
bush
negroes
in
the
interior
from
to
there
was
continuous
fighting
with
the
bush
negroes
or
insurrections
until
at
last
in
a
formal
treaty
between
sixteen
hundred
negroes
and
the
dutch
was
made
immediately
a
new
group
revolted
under
a
mohammedan
arabi
and
they
obtained
land
and
liberty
in
the
coast
negroes
revolted
they
were
checked
but
made
terms
and
settled
in
the
interior
the
bush
negroes
fought
against
both
french
and
english
to
save
guiana
to
the
dutch
but
guiana
was
eventually
divided
between
the
three
the
bush
negroes
still
maintain
their
independence
and
vigor
the
french
encouraged
settlements
in
the
west
indies
in
the
seventeenth
century
but
at
last
finding
that
french
immigrants
would
not
come
they
began
about
to
import
negroes
owing
to
wars
with
england
slaves
were
supplied
by
the
dutch
and
portuguese
although
the
royal
senegal
company
held
the
coveted
asiento
from
to
it
was
in
the
island
of
hayti
however
that
french
slavery
centered
pirates
from
many
nations
but
chiefly
french
began
to
frequent
the
island
and
in
the
french
annexed
the
eastern
part
thus
dividing
the
island
between
france
and
spain
by
there
were
so
many
slaves
and
mulattoes
that
louis
xiv
issued
his
celebrated
code
noir
which
was
notable
in
compelling
bachelor
masters
fathers
of
slave
children
to
marry
their
concubines
children
followed
the
condition
of
the
mother
as
to
slavery
or
freedom
they
could
have
no
property
harsh
punishments
were
provided
for
but
families
could
not
be
separated
by
sale
except
in
the
case
of
grown
children
emancipation
with
full
civil
rights
was
made
possible
for
any
slave
twenty
years
of
age
or
more
when
louisiana
was
settled
and
the
alabama
coast
slaves
were
introduced
there
louisiana
was
transferred
to
spain
in
against
the
resistance
of
both
settlers
and
slaves
but
spain
took
possession
in
and
introduced
more
negroes
later
in
hayti
a
more
liberal
policy
encouraged
trade
war
was
over
and
capital
and
slaves
poured
in
sugar
coffee
chocolate
indigo
dyes
and
spices
were
raised
there
were
large
numbers
of
mulattoes
many
of
whom
were
educated
in
france
and
many
masters
married
negro
women
who
had
inherited
large
properties
just
as
in
the
united
states
white
men
are
marrying
eagerly
the
landed
indian
women
in
the
west
when
white
immigration
increased
in
however
prejudice
arose
against
these
mulattoes
and
severe
laws
were
passed
depriving
them
of
civil
rights
entrance
into
the
professions
and
the
right
to
hold
office
severe
edicts
were
enforced
as
to
clothing
names
and
social
intercourse
finally
after
mulattoes
were
forbidden
to
come
to
france
when
the
french
revolution
broke
out
the
haytians
managed
to
send
two
delegates
to
paris
nevertheless
the
planters
maintained
the
upper
hand
and
one
of
the
colored
delegates
oge
on
returning
started
a
small
rebellion
he
and
his
companions
were
killed
with
great
brutality
this
led
the
french
government
to
grant
full
civil
rights
to
free
negroes
immediately
planters
and
free
negroes
flew
to
arms
against
each
other
and
then
suddenly
august
the
black
slaves
of
whom
there
were
four
hundred
and
thousand
arose
in
revolt
to
help
the
free
negroes
for
many
years
runaway
slaves
had
hidden
in
the
mountains
under
their
own
chiefs
one
of
the
earliest
of
these
chiefs
was
polydor
in
who
was
succeeded
by
macandal
the
great
chief
of
these
runaways
or
maroons
at
the
time
of
the
slave
revolt
was
jean
françois
who
was
soon
succeeded
by
biassou
pierre
dominic
toussaint
known
as
toussaint
joined
these
maroon
bands
where
he
was
called
the
doctor
of
the
armies
of
the
king
and
soon
became
chief
aid
to
jean
françois
and
biassou
upon
their
deaths
toussaint
rose
to
the
chief
command
he
acquired
complete
control
over
the
blacks
not
only
in
military
matters
but
in
politics
and
social
organization
the
soldiers
regarded
him
as
a
superior
being
and
the
farmers
prostrated
themselves
before
him
all
his
generals
trembled
before
him
dessalines
did
not
dare
to
look
in
his
face
and
all
the
world
trembled
before
his
generals
the
revolt
once
started
blacks
and
mulattoes
murdered
whites
without
mercy
and
the
whites
retaliated
commissioners
were
sent
from
france
who
asked
simply
civil
rights
for
freedmen
and
not
emancipation
indeed
that
was
all
that
toussaint
himself
had
as
yet
demanded
the
planters
intrigued
with
the
british
and
this
together
with
the
beheading
of
the
king
an
impious
act
in
the
eyes
of
negroes
induced
toussaint
to
join
the
spaniards
in
british
troops
were
landed
and
the
french
commissioners
in
desperation
declared
the
slaves
emancipated
this
at
once
won
back
toussaint
from
the
spaniards
he
became
supreme
in
the
north
while
rigaud
leader
of
the
mulattoes
held
the
south
and
the
west
by
the
british
having
lost
most
of
their
forces
by
yellow
fever
surrendered
mole
nicholas
to
toussaint
and
departed
rigaud
finally
left
for
france
and
toussaint
in
was
master
of
hayti
he
promulgated
a
constitution
under
which
hayti
was
to
be
a
colony
all
men
were
equal
before
the
law
and
trade
was
practically
free
toussaint
was
to
be
president
for
life
with
the
power
to
name
his
successor
napoleon
bonaparte
master
of
france
had
at
this
time
dreams
of
a
great
american
empire
and
replied
to
toussaint
new
government
by
sending
thousand
men
under
his
to
subdue
the
presumptuous
negroes
as
a
preliminary
step
to
his
occupation
and
development
of
the
mississippi
valley
fierce
fighting
and
yellow
fever
decimated
the
french
but
matters
went
hard
with
the
negroes
too
and
toussaint
finally
offered
to
yield
he
was
courteously
received
with
military
honors
and
then
as
soon
as
possible
treacherously
seized
bound
and
sent
to
france
he
was
imprisoned
at
fort
joux
and
died
perhaps
of
poison
after
studied
humiliations
april
thus
perished
the
greatest
of
american
negroes
and
one
of
the
great
men
of
all
time
at
the
age
of
a
french
planter
said
god
in
his
terrestrial
globe
did
not
commune
with
a
purer
spirit
wendell
phillips
said
some
doubt
the
courage
of
the
negro
go
to
hayti
and
stand
on
those
fifty
thousand
graves
of
the
best
soldiers
france
ever
had
and
ask
them
what
they
think
of
the
negro
sword
i
would
call
him
napoleon
but
napoleon
made
his
way
to
empire
over
broken
oaths
and
through
a
sea
of
blood
this
man
never
broke
his
word
i
would
call
him
cromwell
but
cromwell
was
only
a
soldier
and
the
state
he
founded
went
down
with
him
into
his
grave
i
would
call
him
washington
but
the
great
virginian
held
slaves
this
man
risked
his
empire
rather
than
permit
the
slave
trade
in
the
humblest
village
of
his
dominions
you
think
me
a
fanatic
for
you
read
history
not
with
your
eyes
but
with
your
prejudices
but
fifty
years
hence
when
truth
gets
a
hearing
the
muse
of
history
will
put
phocion
for
the
greek
brutus
for
the
roman
hampden
for
the
english
la
fayette
for
france
choose
washington
as
the
bright
consummate
flower
of
our
earlier
civilization
then
dipping
her
pen
in
the
sunlight
will
write
in
the
clear
blue
above
them
all
the
name
of
the
soldier
the
statesman
the
martyr
toussaint
the
treacherous
killing
of
toussaint
did
not
conquer
hayti
in
and
some
forty
thousand
french
soldiers
died
of
war
and
fever
a
new
colored
leader
dessalines
arose
and
all
the
eight
thousand
remaining
french
surrendered
to
the
blockading
british
fleet
the
effect
of
all
this
was
napoleon
gave
up
his
dream
of
american
empire
and
sold
louisiana
for
a
song
thus
all
of
indian
territory
all
of
kansas
and
nebraska
and
iowa
and
wyoming
and
montana
and
the
dakotas
and
most
of
colorado
and
minnesota
and
all
of
washington
and
oregon
states
came
to
us
as
the
indirect
work
of
a
despised
negro
praise
if
you
will
the
work
of
a
robert
livingstone
or
a
jefferson
but
let
us
not
forget
our
debt
to
toussaint
who
was
indirectly
the
means
of
america
expansion
by
the
louisiana
purchase
of
with
the
freedom
of
hayti
in
came
a
century
of
struggle
to
fit
the
people
for
the
freedom
they
had
won
they
were
yet
slaves
crushed
by
a
cruel
servitude
without
education
or
religious
instruction
the
haytian
leaders
united
upon
dessalines
to
maintain
the
independence
of
the
republic
dessalines
like
toussaint
and
his
lieutenant
christophe
was
noted
in
slavery
days
for
his
severity
toward
his
fellows
and
the
discipline
which
he
insisted
on
he
had
other
characteristics
of
african
chieftains
there
were
seasons
when
he
broke
through
his
natural
sullenness
and
showed
himself
open
affable
and
even
generous
his
vanity
was
excessive
and
manifested
itself
in
singular
perversities
he
was
a
man
of
great
personal
bravery
and
succeeded
in
maintaining
the
independence
of
hayti
which
had
already
cost
the
frenchmen
fifty
thousand
lives
on
january
at
the
place
whence
toussaint
had
been
treacherously
seized
and
sent
to
france
the
independence
of
hayti
was
declared
by
the
military
leaders
dessalines
was
made
for
life
and
afterward
proclaimed
himself
emperor
this
was
not
an
act
of
grandiloquence
and
mimicry
it
is
truer
to
say
that
in
it
both
dessalines
and
later
christophe
were
actuated
by
a
clear
insight
into
the
social
history
and
peculiarities
of
their
people
there
was
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
did
not
have
its
companion
in
africa
where
the
organization
of
society
was
despotic
with
elective
hereditary
chiefs
royal
families
polygamic
marriages
councils
and
regencies
the
population
was
divided
into
soldiers
and
laborers
the
territory
was
parceled
out
to
chiefs
and
the
laborers
were
bound
to
the
soil
and
worked
under
rigorous
inspection
part
of
the
products
were
reserved
for
their
support
and
the
rest
went
to
the
chiefs
the
king
the
general
government
and
the
army
the
army
was
under
stern
discipline
and
military
service
was
compulsory
women
did
much
of
the
agricultural
labor
under
toussaint
the
administration
of
this
system
was
committed
to
dessalines
who
carried
it
out
with
rigor
it
was
afterward
followed
by
christophe
the
latter
even
imported
four
thousand
negroes
from
africa
from
whom
he
formed
a
national
guard
for
patrolling
the
land
these
regulations
brought
back
for
a
time
a
large
part
of
the
former
prosperity
of
the
island
the
severity
with
which
dessalines
enforced
the
laws
soon
began
to
turn
many
against
him
the
educated
mulattoes
especially
objected
to
submission
to
the
savage
african
dessalines
started
to
suppress
their
revolt
but
was
killed
in
ambush
in
october
great
britain
now
began
to
intrigue
for
a
protectorate
over
the
island
and
the
spanish
end
of
the
island
threatened
attack
these
difficulties
were
overcome
but
at
a
cost
of
great
internal
strain
after
the
death
of
dessalines
it
seemed
that
hayti
was
about
to
dissolve
into
a
number
of
petty
subdivisions
at
one
time
christophe
was
ruling
as
king
in
the
north
petion
as
president
at
port
au
prince
rigaud
in
the
south
and
a
goman
in
the
extreme
southwest
very
soon
however
the
rivalry
narrowed
down
to
petion
and
christophe
petion
was
a
man
of
considerable
ability
and
did
much
not
simply
for
hayti
but
for
south
america
already
as
early
as
before
the
revolution
in
hayti
the
haytian
negroes
had
helped
the
united
states
the
british
had
captured
savannah
in
the
french
fleet
appeared
on
the
coast
of
georgia
late
that
year
and
was
ordered
to
recruit
men
in
hayti
eight
hundred
young
freedmen
blacks
and
mulattoes
offered
to
take
part
in
the
expedition
and
they
fought
valiantly
in
the
siege
and
covered
themselves
with
glory
it
was
this
legion
that
made
the
charge
on
the
british
and
saved
the
retreating
american
army
among
the
men
who
fought
there
was
christophe
when
simon
bolivar
commodore
aury
and
many
venezuelan
families
were
driven
from
their
country
in
they
and
their
ships
took
temporary
refuge
in
hayti
notwithstanding
the
embarrassed
condition
of
the
republic
petion
received
them
and
gave
them
four
thousand
rifles
with
ammunition
provisions
and
last
and
best
a
printing
press
he
also
settled
some
international
quarrels
among
members
of
the
groups
and
bolivar
expressed
himself
afterward
as
being
overwhelmed
with
magnanimous
favors
petion
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
his
friend
boyer
christophe
committed
suicide
the
following
year
and
boyer
became
not
simply
ruler
of
western
hayti
but
also
by
arrangement
with
the
eastern
end
of
the
island
gained
the
mastery
there
where
they
were
afraid
of
spanish
aggression
thus
from
to
boyer
a
man
of
much
ability
ruled
the
whole
of
the
island
and
gained
the
recognition
of
haytian
independence
from
france
and
other
nations
france
under
charles
x
demanded
an
indemnity
of
thirty
million
dollars
to
reimburse
the
planters
for
confiscated
lands
and
property
this
hayti
tried
to
pay
but
the
annual
installment
was
a
tremendous
burden
to
the
impoverished
country
further
negotiations
were
entered
into
finally
in
france
recognized
the
independence
of
the
republic
and
the
indemnity
was
reduced
to
twelve
million
dollars
even
this
was
a
large
burden
for
hayti
and
the
payment
of
it
for
years
crippled
the
island
the
united
states
and
great
britain
in
recognized
the
independence
of
hayti
a
concordat
was
arranged
with
the
pope
for
governing
the
church
in
hayti
and
finally
in
the
church
placed
under
the
french
hierarchy
thus
boyer
did
unusually
well
but
his
necessary
concessions
to
france
weakened
his
influence
at
home
and
finally
an
earthquake
which
destroyed
several
towns
in
raised
the
superstitious
of
the
populace
against
him
he
resigned
in
leaving
the
treasury
well
filled
but
with
his
withdrawal
the
spanish
portion
of
the
island
was
lost
to
hayti
the
subsequent
history
of
hayti
since
has
been
the
struggle
of
a
small
divided
country
to
maintain
political
independence
the
rich
resources
of
the
country
called
for
foreign
capital
but
outside
capital
meant
political
influence
from
abroad
which
the
little
nation
rightly
feared
within
the
old
antagonism
between
the
freedman
and
the
slave
settled
into
a
color
line
between
the
mulatto
and
the
black
which
for
a
time
meant
the
difference
between
educated
liberalism
and
reactionary
ignorance
this
difference
has
largely
disappeared
but
some
vestiges
of
the
color
line
remain
the
result
has
been
reaction
and
savagery
under
soulouque
dominique
and
nord
alexis
and
decided
advance
under
presidents
like
solomon
legitime
and
hyppolite
in
political
life
hayti
is
still
in
the
sixteenth
century
but
in
economic
life
she
has
succeeded
in
placing
on
their
own
little
farms
the
happiest
and
most
contented
peasantry
in
the
world
after
raising
them
from
a
veritable
hell
of
slavery
if
modern
capitalistic
greed
can
be
restrained
from
interference
until
the
best
elements
of
hayti
secure
permanent
political
leadership
the
triumph
of
the
revolution
will
be
complete
in
other
parts
of
the
dominion
the
slaves
achieved
freedom
also
by
insurrection
in
guadeloupe
they
helped
the
french
drive
out
the
british
and
thus
gained
emancipation
in
martinique
it
took
three
revolts
and
a
civil
war
to
bring
freedom
the
english
slave
empire
in
america
centered
in
the
bermudas
barbadoes
jamaica
and
the
lesser
islands
and
in
the
united
states
barbadoes
developed
a
savage
slave
code
and
the
result
was
attempted
slave
insurrections
in
and
these
were
not
successful
but
a
rising
in
destroyed
much
property
under
the
leadership
of
a
mulatto
washington
franklin
and
the
repeal
of
bad
laws
and
eventual
enfranchisement
of
the
colored
people
followed
one
barbadian
mulatto
sir
conrad
reeves
has
held
the
position
of
chief
justice
in
the
island
and
was
knighted
a
negro
insurrection
in
dominica
under
farcel
greatly
exercised
england
in
and
and
delayed
slave
trade
abolition
in
and
further
uprisings
took
place
and
these
continued
from
to
the
chief
island
domain
of
english
slavery
was
jamaica
it
was
oliver
cromwell
who
in
his
zeal
for
god
and
the
slave
trade
sent
an
expedition
to
seize
hayti
his
fleet
driven
off
there
took
jamaica
in
the
english
found
the
mountains
already
infested
with
runaway
slaves
known
as
maroons
and
more
negroes
joined
them
when
the
english
arrived
in
the
freedom
of
the
maroons
was
acknowledged
land
was
given
them
and
their
leader
juan
de
bolas
was
made
a
colonel
in
the
militia
he
was
killed
however
in
the
following
year
and
from
to
the
three
thousand
or
more
black
maroons
fought
the
british
empire
in
guerrilla
warfare
soldiers
indians
and
dogs
were
sent
against
them
and
finally
in
captain
cudjo
and
other
chiefs
made
a
formal
treaty
of
peace
with
governor
trelawney
they
were
granted
hundred
acres
and
their
freedom
was
recognized
the
peace
lasted
until
when
they
rebelled
again
and
gave
the
british
a
severe
drubbing
besides
murdering
planters
bloodhounds
again
were
imported
the
maroons
offered
to
surrender
on
the
express
condition
that
none
of
their
number
should
be
deported
from
the
island
as
the
legislature
wished
general
walpole
hesitated
but
could
get
peace
on
no
other
terms
and
gave
his
word
the
maroons
surrendered
their
arms
and
immediately
the
whites
seized
six
hundred
of
the
ringleaders
and
transported
them
to
the
snows
of
nova
scotia
the
legislature
then
voted
a
sword
worth
hundred
dollars
to
general
walpole
which
he
indignantly
refused
to
accept
eventually
these
exiled
maroons
found
their
way
to
sierra
leone
west
africa
in
time
to
save
that
colony
to
the
british
crown
the
pressing
desire
for
peace
with
the
maroons
on
the
part
of
the
white
planters
arose
from
the
new
sugar
culture
introduced
in
a
greatly
increased
demand
for
slaves
followed
and
between
and
six
hundred
and
ten
thousand
slaves
were
imported
nevertheless
so
severely
were
they
driven
that
there
were
only
three
hundred
thousand
negroes
in
jamaica
in
the
latter
year
despite
the
moravian
missions
and
other
efforts
late
in
the
eighteenth
century
unrest
among
the
jamaica
slaves
and
freedmen
grew
and
was
increased
by
the
agitation
in
england
and
the
revolt
in
hayti
there
was
an
insurrection
in
and
in
again
the
negroes
of
northwest
jamaica
impatient
because
of
the
slow
progress
of
the
emancipation
arose
in
revolt
and
destroyed
nearly
three
and
a
half
million
dollars
worth
of
property
ruining
the
planters
there
the
next
year
two
hundred
and
thousand
slaves
were
set
free
for
which
the
planters
were
paid
nearly
thirty
million
dollars
there
ensued
a
discouraging
condition
of
industry
the
white
officials
sent
out
in
these
days
were
arbitrary
and
corrupt
little
was
done
for
the
mass
of
the
people
and
there
was
outrageous
nevertheless
the
backwardness
of
the
colony
was
attributed
to
the
negro
governor
eyre
complained
in
that
the
young
and
strong
were
good
for
nothing
and
were
filling
the
jails
but
a
simultaneous
report
by
a
missionary
told
the
truth
concerning
the
officials
this
aroused
the
colored
people
and
a
mulatto
george
william
gordon
called
a
meeting
other
meetings
were
afterward
held
and
finally
the
negro
peasantry
began
a
riot
in
in
which
eighteen
people
were
killed
only
a
few
of
whom
were
white
the
result
was
that
governor
eyre
tried
and
executed
by
persons
and
in
addition
to
this
killed
without
trial
a
total
of
one
thousand
negro
homes
were
burned
to
the
ground
and
thousands
of
negroes
flogged
or
mutilated
children
had
their
brains
dashed
out
pregnant
women
were
murdered
and
gordon
was
tried
by
and
hanged
in
fact
the
punishment
was
as
the
royal
commissioners
said
reckless
and
positively
barbarous
this
act
aroused
england
eyre
was
not
punished
but
the
island
was
made
a
crown
colony
in
and
given
representation
in
the
legislature
in
in
the
island
of
vincent
indians
first
sought
to
enslave
the
fugitive
negroes
wrecked
there
but
the
negroes
took
the
carib
women
and
then
drove
the
indian
men
away
these
black
caribs
fought
with
indians
english
and
others
for
three
quarters
of
a
century
until
the
indians
were
exterminated
the
british
took
possession
in
the
black
caribs
resisted
and
after
hard
fighting
signed
a
treaty
in
receiving
of
the
island
as
their
property
they
afterward
helped
the
french
against
the
british
and
were
finally
deported
to
the
island
of
ruatan
off
honduras
in
trinidad
and
british
guiana
there
have
been
mutinies
and
rioting
of
slaves
and
a
curious
mingling
of
races
other
parts
of
south
america
must
be
dismissed
briefly
because
of
insufficient
data
colombia
and
venezuela
with
perhaps
eight
million
people
have
at
least
of

the

there
were
half
a
million
slaves
in
the
confines
of

when
the
declaration
of
independence
declared
that
all

are

that
they
are
endowed
by
their

with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
among

are

the

that
thus
magniloquently
heralded
its
advent
into
the
family
of
nations
had
supported
the
institution
of
human
slavery
for
one
hundred
and
years
and
was
destined
to
cling
to
it
years
longer
the
greatest
experiment
in
negro
slavery
as
a
modern
industrial
system
was
made
on
the
mainland
of
north
america
and
in
the
confines
of
the
present
united

and
this
experiment
was
on
such
a
scale
and
so
that
it
is
profitable
for
study
and
reflection
there
were
in
the
united
states
in
its
dependencies
in
persons
of
acknowledged
negro
descent
not
including
the
considerable
infiltration
of
negro
blood
which
is
not
acknowledged
and
often
not
known
the
number
of
persons
called
negroes
is
probably
about
ten
and
a
quarter
million
these
persons
are
almost
entirely
descendants
of
african
slaves
brought
to
america
in
the
sixteenth
seventeenth
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
the
importation
of
negroes
to
the
mainland
of
north
america
was
small
until
the
british
got
the
coveted
privilege
of
the
asiento
in
before
that
northern
states
like
new
york
had
received
some
slaves
from
the
dutch
and
new
england
had
early
developed
a
trade
by
which
she
imported
a
number
of
house
servants
ships
went
out
to
the
african
coast
with
rum
sold
the
rum
and
brought
the
slaves
to
the
west
indies
there
they
exchanged
the
slaves
for
sugar
and
molasses
and
brought
the
molasses
back
to
new
england
to
be
made
into
rum
for
further
exploits
after
the
asiento
treaty
the
negro
population
increased
in
the
eighteenth
century
from
about
in
to
in
and
to
in
when
the
colonies
became
independent
the
foreign
slave
trade
was
soon
made
illegal
but
illicit
trade
annexation
of
territory
and
natural
increase
enlarged
the
negro
population
from
a
little
over
a
million
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
four
and
a
half
millions
at
the
outbreak
of
the
civil
war
and
to
about
ten
and
a
quarter
millions
in
the
present
negro
population
of
the
united

is
a
mixture
of
the
various
african
populations
bantu
sudanese
negroes
some
dwarfs
and
some
traces
of
arab
berber
and
semitic
blood
a
mixture
of
these
strains
with
the
blood
of
white
americans
through
a
system
of
concubinage
of
colored
women
in
slavery
days
together
with
some
legal
intermarriage
the
figures
as
to
mulattoes
have
been
from
time
to
time
officially
acknowledged
to
be
understatements
probably
of
the
negroes
of
the
united
states
have
distinct
traces
of
white
blood
this
blending
of
the
races
has
led
to
interesting
human
types
but
racial
prejudice
has
hitherto
prevented
any
scientific
study
of
the
matter
in
general
the
negro
population
in
the
united
states
is
brown
in
color
darkening
to
almost
black
and
shading
off
in
the
other
direction
to
yellow
and
white
and
is
indistinguishable
in
some
cases
from
the
white
population
much
has
been
written
of
the
black
man
in
america
but
most
of
this
has
been
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
whites
so
that
we
know
of
the
effect
of
negro
slavery
on
the
whites
the
strife
among
the
whites
for
and
against
abolition
and
the
consequent
problem
of
the
negro
so
far
as
the
white
population
is
concerned
this
chapter
however
is
dealing
with
the
matter
more
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
negro
group
itself
and
seeking
to
show
what
slavery
meant
to
them
how
they
reacted
against
it
what
they
did
to
secure
their
freedom
and
what
they
are
doing
with
their
partial
freedom
the
slaves
landing
from
onward
were
received
by
the
colonies
at
first
as
laborers
on
the
same
plane
as
other
laborers
for
a
long
time
there
was
in
law
no
distinction
between
the
indented
white
servant
from
england
and
the
black
servant
from
africa
except
in
the
term
of
their
service
even
here
the
distinction
was
not
always
observed
some
of
the
whites
being
kept
beyond
term
of
their
service
and
negroes
now
and
then
securing
their
freedom
gradually
the
planters
realized
the
advantage
of
laborers
held
for
life
but
they
were
met
by
certain
moral
difficulties
the
opposition
to
slavery
had
from
the
first
been
largely
stilled
when
it
was
stated
that
this
was
a
method
of
converting
the
heathen
to
christianity
the
corollary
was
that
when
a
slave
was
converted
he
became
free
up
to
or
thereabouts
it
seemed
accepted
in
most
colonies
and
in
the
english
west
indies
that
baptism
into
a
christian
church
would
free
a
negro
slave
masters
therefore
were
reluctant
in
the
seventeenth
century
to
have
their
slaves
receive
christian
instruction
massachusetts
first
apparently
legislated
on
this
matter
by
enacting
in
that
slavery
should
be
confined
to
captives
in
just
wars
and
such
strangers
as
willingly
sell
themselves
or
are
sold
to
us
meaning
by
strangers
apparently
heathen
but
saying
nothing
as
to
the
effect
of
conversion
connecticut
adopted
similar
legislation
in
and
virginia
declared
in
that
negroes
are
incapable
of
making
satisfaction
for
time
lost
in
running
away
by
lengthening
their
time
of
services
thus
implying
that
they
were
slaves
for
life
maryland
declared
in
that
negro
slaves
should
serve
but
it
was
not
until
that
virginia
finally
plucked
up
courage
to
attack
the
issue
squarely
and
declared
by
law
baptism
doth
not
alter
the
condition
of
the
person
as
to
his
bondage
or
freedom
in
order
that
diverse
masters
freed
from
this
doubt
may
more
carefully
endeavor
the
propagation
of
christianity
the
transplanting
of
the
negro
from
his
african
clan
life
to
the
west
indian
plantation
was
a
social
revolution
marriage
became
geographical
and
transient
while
women
and
girls
were
without
protection
the
private
home
as
a
independent
unit
did
not
exist
that
powerful
institution
the
polygamous
african
home
was
almost
completely
destroyed
and
in
its
place
in
america
arose
sexual
promiscuity
a
weak
community
life
with
common
dwelling
meals
and
child
nurseries
the
internal
slave
trade
tended
further
to
weaken
natural
ties
a
small
number
of
favored
house
servants
and
artisans
were
raised
above
this
had
their
private
homes
came
in
contact
with
the
culture
of
the
master
class
and
assimilated
much
of
american
civilization
this
was
however
exceptional
broadly
speaking
the
greatest
social
effect
of
american
slavery
was
to
substitute
for
the
polygamous
negro
home
a
new
polygamy
less
guarded
less
effective
and
less
civilized
at
first
sight
it
would
seem
that
slavery
completely
destroyed
every
vestige
of
spontaneous
movement
among
the
negroes
this
is
not
strictly
true
the
vast
power
of
the
priest
in
the
african
state
is
well
known
his
realm
alone
the
province
of
religion
and
medicine
remained
largely
unaffected
by
the
plantation
system
the
negro
priest
therefore
early
became
an
important
figure
on
the
plantation
and
found
his
function
as
the
interpreter
of
the
supernatural
the
comforter
of
the
sorrowing
and
as
the
one
who
expressed
rudely
but
picturesquely
the
longing
and
disappointment
and
resentment
of
a
stolen
people
from
such
beginnings
arose
and
spread
with
marvelous
rapidity
the
negro
church
the
first
distinctively
negro
american
social
institution
it
was
not
at
first
by
any
means
a
christian
church
but
a
mere
adaptation
of
those
rites
of
fetish
which
in
america
is
termed
obe
worship
or
voodooism
association
and
missionary
effort
soon
gave
these
rites
a
veneer
of
christianity
and
gradually
after
two
centuries
the
church
became
christian
with
a
simple
calvinistic
creed
but
with
many
of
the
old
customs
still
clinging
to
the
services
it
is
this
historic
fact
that
the
negro
church
of
bases
itself
upon
the
sole
surviving
social
institution
of
the
african
fatherland
that
accounts
for
its
extraordinary
growth
and
vitality
the
slave
codes
at
first
were
really
labor
codes
based
on
an
attempt
to
reestablish
in
america
the
waning
feudalism
of
europe
the
laborers
were
mainly
black
and
were
held
for
life
above
them
came
the
artisans
free
whites
with
a
few
blacks
and
above
them
the
master
class
the
feudalism
called
for
the
plantation
system
and
the
plantation
system
as
developed
in
america
and
particularly
in
virginia
was
at
first
a
feudal
domain
on
these
plantations
the
master
was
practically
supreme
the
slave
codes
in
early
days
were
but
moderately
harsh
allowing
punishment
by
the
master
but
restraining
him
in
extreme
cases
and
providing
for
care
of
the
slaves
and
of
the
aged
with
the
power
however
solely
in
the
hands
of
the
master
class
and
with
the
master
supreme
on
his
own
plantation
his
power
over
the
slave
was
practically
what
he
wished
it
to
be
in
some
cases
the
cruelty
was
as
great
as
on
the
worst
west
indian
plantations
in
other
cases
the
rule
was
mild
and
paternal
up
through
this
american
feudalism
the
negro
began
to
rise
he
learned
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
english
language
he
began
to
be
identified
with
the
christian
church
he
mingled
his
blood
to
a
considerable
extent
with
the
master
class
the
house
servants
particularly
were
favored
in
some
cases
receiving
education
and
the
number
of
free
negroes
gradually
increased
students
are
often
puzzled
at
the
apparent
contradictions
of
southern
slavery
one
hears
on
the
one
hand
of
the
staid
and
gentle
patriarchy
the
wide
and
sleepy
plantations
with
lord
and
retainers
ease
and
happiness
on
the
other
hand
one
hears
of
barbarous
cruelty
and
unbridled
power
and
wide
oppression
of
men
which
is
the
true
picture
the
answer
is
simple
both
are
true
they
are
not
opposite
sides
of
the
same
shield
they
are
different
shields
they
are
pictures
on
the
one
hand
of
house
service
in
the
great
country
seats
and
in
the
towns
and
on
the
other
hand
of
the
field
laborers
who
raised
the
great
tobacco
rice
and
cotton
crops
we
have
thus
not
only
carelessly
mixed
pictures
of
what
were
really
different
kinds
of
slavery
but
of
that
which
represented
different
degrees
in
the
development
of
the
economic
system
house
service
was
the
older
feudal
idea
of
personal
retainership
developed
in
virginia
and
carolina
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
it
had
all
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
such
a
system
the
advantage
of
the
strong
personal
tie
and
disadvantage
of
unyielding
caste
distinctions
with
the
resultant
immoralities
at
its
worst
however
it
was
a
matter
primarily
of
human
relationships
out
of
this
older
type
of
slavery
in
the
northern
south
there
developed
during
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
in
the
southern
south
the
type
of
slavery
which
corresponds
to
the
modern
factory
system
in
its
worst
conceivable
form
it
represented
production
of
a
staple
product
on
a
large
scale
between
the
owner
and
laborer
were
interposed
the
overseer
and
the
drivers
the
slaves
were
whipped
and
driven
to
a
mechanical
task
system
wide
territory
was
needed
so
that
at
last
absentee
landlordship
was
common
it
was
this
latter
type
of
slavery
that
marked
the
cotton
kingdom
and
the
extension
of
the
area
of
this
system
southward
and
westward
marked
the
aggressive
visions
of
the
slave
barons
on
the
other
hand
it
was
the
milder
and
far
different
virginia
house
service
and
the
personal
retainership
of
town
life
in
which
most
white
children
grew
up
it
was
this
that
impressed
their
imaginations
and
which
they
have
so
vividly
portrayed
the
negroes
however
knew
the
other
side
for
it
was
under
the
harsher
heartless
driving
of
the
fields
that
fully
of
them
lived
there
early
began
to
be
some
internal
development
and
growth
of
among
the
negroes
for
instance
in
new
england
towns
negro
governors
were
elected
this
was
partly
an
african
custom
transplanted
and
partly
an
endeavor
to
put
the
regulation
of
the
slaves
into
their
own
hands
negroes
voted
in
those
days
for
instance
in
north
carolina
until
the
constitution
extended
the
franchise
to
every
freeman
and
when
negroes
were
disfranchised
in
several
hundred
colored
men
were
deprived
of
the
vote
in
fact
as
albert
bushnell
hart
says
in
the
colonies
freed
negroes
like
freed
indentured
white
servants
acquired
property
founded
families
and
came
into
the
political
community
if
they
had
the
energy
thrift
and
fortune
to
get
the
necessary
property
the
humanitarian
movement
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
active
toward
negroes
because
of
the
part
which
they
played
in
the
revolutionary
war
negro
regiments
and
companies
were
raised
in
connecticut
and
rhode
island
and
a
large
number
of
negroes
were
members
of
the
continental
armies
elsewhere
individual
negroes
distinguished
themselves
it
is
estimated
that
five
thousand
negroes
fought
in
the
american
armies
the
mass
of
the
americans
considered
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
that
negro
slavery
was
doomed
there
soon
came
a
series
of
laws
emancipating
slaves
in
the
north
vermont
began
in
followed
by
judicial
decision
in
massachusetts
in
and
gradual
emancipation
in
pennsylvania
beginning
the
same
year
emancipation
was
accomplished
in
new
hampshire
in
and
in
connecticut
and
rhode
island
in
the
momentous
exclusion
of
slavery
in
the
northwest
territory
took
place
in
and
gradual
emancipation
began
in
new
york
and
new
jersey
in
and
beneficial
and
insurance
societies
began
to
appear
among
colored
people
nearly
every
town
of
any
size
in
virginia
in
the
early
eighteenth
century
had
negro
organizations
for
caring
for
the
sick
and
burying
the
dead
as
the
number
of
free
negroes
increased
particularly
in
the
north
these
financial
societies
began
to
be
openly
formed
one
of
the
earliest
was
the
free
african
society
of
philadelphia
this
eventually
became
the
present
african
methodist
church
which
has
half
a
million
members
and
over
eleven
million
dollars
worth
of
property
negroes
began
to
be
received
into
the
white
church
bodies
in
separate
congregations
and
before
there
is
the
record
of
the
formation
of
eight
such
negro
churches
this
brought
forth
leaders
who
were
usually
preachers
in
these
churches
richard
allen
the
founder
of
the
african
methodist
church
was
one
lot
carey
one
of
the
founders
of
liberia
was
another
in
the
south
there
was
john
chavis
who
passed
through
a
regular
course
of
studies
at
what
is
now
washington
and
lee
university
he
started
a
school
for
young
white
men
in
north
carolina
and
had
among
his
pupils
a
united
states
senator
sons
of
a
chief
justice
of
north
carolina
a
governor
of
the
state
and
many
others
he
was
a
negro
but
a
southern
writer
says
that
all
accounts
agree
that
john
chavis
was
a
gentleman
he
was
received
socially
among
the
best
whites
and
asked
to

the

wrote
poetry
and
the
mulatto

banneker
published
one
of
the
first
american
series
of
almanacs
in
fine
it
seemed
in
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
slavery
in
the
united
states
would
gradually
disappear
and
that
the
negro
would
have
in
time
a
man
chance
a
change
came
however
between
and
and
it
is
directly
traceable
to
the
industrial
revolution
of
the
nineteenth
century
between
and
there
had
come
a
remarkable
series
of
inventions
which
revolutionized
the
methods
of
making
cloth
this
series
included
the
invention
of
the
fly
shuttle
the
carding
machine
the
steam
engine
and
the
power
loom
the
world
began
to
look
about
for
a
cheaper
and
larger
supply
of
fiber
for
weaving
it
was
found
in
the
cotton
plant
and
the
southern
united
states
was
especially
adapted
to
its
culture
the
invention
of
the
cotton
gin
removed
the
last
difficulties
the
south
now
had
a
crop
which
could
be
attended
to
by
unskilled
labor
and
for
which
there
was
practically
unlimited
demand
there
was
land
and
rich
land
in
plenty
the
result
was
that
the
cotton
crop
in
the
united
states
increased
from
bales
in
to
bales
in
to
bales
in
and
to
bales
in
in
this
growth
one
sees
the
economic
foundation
of
the
new
slavery
in
the
united
states
which
rose
in
the
second
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
manifestly
the
fatal
procrastination
in
dealing
with
slavery
in
the
eighteenth
century
received
in
the
nineteenth
century
its
terrible
reward
the
change
in
the
attitude
toward
slavery
was
manifest
in
various
ways
the
south
no
longer
excused
slavery
but
began
to
defend
it
as
an
economic
system
the
enforcement
of
the
slave
trade
laws
became
notoriously
lax
and
there
was
a
tendency
to
make
slave
codes
harsher
this
led
to
retaliation
on
the
part
of
the
negroes
there
had
not
been
in
the
united
states
before
this
many
attempts
at
insurrection
the
slaves
were
distributed
over
a
wide
territory
and
before
they
became
intelligent
enough
to
cooperate
the
chance
of
emancipation
was
held
before
them
several
small
insurrections
are
alluded
to
in
south
carolina
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
one
by
cato
at
stono
in
caused
widespread
alarm
the
negro
plot
in
new
york
in
put
the
city
into
hysterics
there
was
no
further
plotting
on
any
scale
until
the
haytian
revolt
when
gabriel
in
virginia
made
an
abortive
attempt
in
a
free
negro
denmark
vesey
in
south
carolina
failed
in
a
plot
and
ten
years
after
that
in
nat
turner
led
his
insurrection
in
virginia
and
killed
persons
the
result
of
this
insurrection
was
to
crystallize
tendencies
toward
harshness
which
the
economic
revolution
was
making
advisable
a
wave
of
legislation
passed
over
the
south
prohibiting
the
slaves
from
learning
to
read
and
write
forbidding
negroes
to
preach
and
interfering
with
negro
religious
meetings
virginia
declared
in
that
neither
slaves
nor
free
negroes
might
preach
nor
could
they
attend
religious
service
at
night
without
permission
in
north
carolina
slaves
and
free
negroes
were
forbidden
to
preach
exhort
or
teach
in
any
prayer
meeting
or
other
association
for
worship
where
slaves
of
different
families
are
collected
together
on
penalty
of
not
more
than
lashes
maryland
and
georgia
and
other
states
had
similar
laws
the
real
effective
revolt
of
the
negro
against
slavery
was
not
however
by
fighting
but
by
running
away
usually
to
the
north
which
had
been
recently
freed
from
slavery
from
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
slaves
began
to
escape
in
considerable
numbers
four
geographical
paths
were
chiefly
followed
one
leading
southward
was
the
line
of
swamps
along
the
coast
from
norfolk
virginia
to
the
northern
border
of
florida
this
gave
rise
to
the
negro
element
among
the
indians
in
florida
and
led
to
the
two
seminole
wars
of
and
these
wars
were
really
slave
raids
to
make
the
indians
give
up
the
negro
and
slaves
domiciled
among
them
the
wars
cost
the
united
states
ten
million
dollars
and
two
thousand
lives
the
great
appalachian
range
with
its
abutting
mountains
was
the
safest
path
northward
through
tennessee
and
kentucky
and
the
heart
of
the
cumberland
mountains
using
the
limestone
caverns
was
the
third
route
and
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
was
the
western
tunnel
these
runaways
and
the
freedmen
of
the
north
soon
began
to
form
a
group
of
people
who
sought
to
consider
the
problem
of
slavery
and
the
destiny
of
the
negro
in
america
they
passed
through
many
psychological
changes
of
attitude
in
the
years
from
to
at
first
in
the
early
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
there
was
but
one
thought
revolt
and
revenge
the
development
of
the
latter
half
of
the
century
brought
an
attitude
of
hope
and
adjustment
and
emphasized
the
differences
between
the
slave
and
the
free
negro
the
first
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
brought
two
movements
among
the
free
negroes
an
effort
at
and
protection
through
organization
among
slaves
and
recent
fugitives
a
distinct
reversion
to
the
older
idea
of
revolt
as
the
new
industrial
slavery
following
the
rise
of
the
cotton
kingdom
began
to
press
harder
a
period
of
storm
and
stress
ensued
in
the
black
world
and
in
came
the
first
almost
hysterical
protest
of
a
negro
against
slavery
and
the
color
line
in
david
walker
appeal
which
aroused
southern
legislatures
to
action
the
decade
was
a
severe
period
of
trial
not
only
were
the
chains
of
slavery
tighter
in
the
south
but
in
the
north
the
free
negro
was
beginning
to
feel
the
ostracism
and
competition
of
white
workingmen
native
and
foreign
in
philadelphia
between
and
six
mobs
of
hoodlums
and
foreigners
murdered
and
maltreated
negroes
in
the
middle
west
harsh
black
laws
which
had
been
enacted
in
earlier
days
were
hauled
from
their
hiding
places
and
put
into
effect
no
negro
was
allowed
to
settle
in
ohio
unless
he
gave
bond
within
twenty
days
to
the
amount
of
five
thousand
dollars
to
guarantee
his
good
behavior
and
support
harboring
or
concealing
fugitives
was
heavily
fined
and
no
negro
could
give
evidence
in
any
case
where
a
white
man
was
party
these
laws
began
to
be
enforced
in
and
for
three
days
riots
went
on
in
cincinnati
and
negroes
were
shot
and
killed
aroused
the
negroes
sent
a
deputation
to
canada
where
they
were
offered
asylum
fully
two
thousand
migrated
from
ohio
later
large
numbers
from
other
parts
of
the
united
states
joined
them
in
the
first
negro
conventions
were
called
in
philadelphia
to
consider
the
desperate
condition
of
the
negro
population
and
in
the
convention
met
again
and
local
societies
were
formed
the
first
negro
paper
was
issued
in
new
york
in
while
later
emancipation
in
the
british
west
indies
brought
some
cheer
in
the
darkness
a
system
of
separate
negro
schools
was
established
and
the
little
band
of
abolitionists
led
by
garrison
and
others
appeared
in
spite
of
all
the
untoward
circumstances
therefore
the
internal
development
of
the
free
negro
in
the
north
went
on
the
negro
population
increased
per
cent
between
and
philadelphia
had
in
one
hundred
small
beneficial
societies
while
ohio
negroes
had
ten
thousand
acres
of
land
the
slave
mutiny
on
the
creole
the
establishment
of
the
negro
odd
fellows
and
the
growth
of
the
negro
churches
all
indicated
advancement
between
and
the
concerted
coöperation
to
assist
fugitives
came
to
be
known
as
the
underground
railroad
it
was
an
organization
not
simply
of
white
philanthropists
but
the
coöperation
of
negroes
in
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
work
made
it
possible
hundreds
of
negroes
visited
the
slave
states
to
entice
the
slaves
away
and
the
list
of
underground
railroad
operators
given
by
siebert
contains
one
hundred
and
names
of
negroes
in
canada
and
in
the
northern
united
states
there
was
a
secret
society
known
as
the
league
of
freedom
which
especially
worked
to
help
slaves
run
away
harriet
tubman
was
one
of
the
most
energetic
of
these
slave
conductors
and
brought
away
several
thousand
slaves
william
lambert
a
colored
man
was
reputed
between
and
to
have
aided
in
the
escape
of
thirty
thousand
the
decade
was
a
period
of
hope
and
uplift
for
the
negro
group
with
clear
evidences
of
distinct
and
advance
a
few
lawyers
and
physicians
appeared
and
colored
men
took
their
place
among
the
abolition
orators
the
catering
business
in
philadelphia
and
other
cities
fell
largely
into
their
hands
and
some
small
merchants
arose
here
and
there
above
all
frederick
douglass
made
his
first
speech
in
and
thereafter
became
one
of
the
most
prominent
figures
in
the
abolition
crusade
a
new
series
of
national
conventions
began
to
assemble
late
in
the
forties
and
the
delegates
were
drawn
from
the
artisans
and
higher
servants
showing
a
great
increase
of
efficiency
in
the
rank
and
file
of
the
free
negroes
by
the
negroes
had
increased
to
three
and
a
half
million
those
in
canada
were
being
organized
in
settlements
and
were
accumulating
property
the
escape
of
fugitive
slaves
was
systematized
and
some
of
the
most
representative
conventions
met
one
particularly
in
grappled
frankly
with
the
problem
of
emigration
it
looked
as
though
it
was
going
to
be
impossible
for
negroes
to
remain
in
the
united
states
and
be
free
as
early
as
a
negro
union
of
newport
rhode
island
had
proposed
a
general
exodus
to
africa
john
and
paul
cuffe
after
petitioning
for
the
right
to
vote
in
started
in
for
africa
organizing
an
expedition
at
their
own
expense
which
cost
four
thousand
dollars
lot
carey
organized
the
african
mission
society
in
and
the
first
negro
college
graduate
went
to
liberia
in
and
became
superintendent
of
public
schools
the
colonization
society
encouraged
this
migration
and
the
negroes
themselves
had
organized
the
canadian
exodus
the
rochester
negro
convention
in
pronounced
against
migration
but
nevertheless
emissaries
were
sent
in
various
directions
to
see
what
inducements
could
be
offered
one
went
to
the
niger
valley
one
to
central
america
and
one
to
hayti
the
haytian
trip
was
successful
and
about
two
thousand
black
emigrants
eventually
settled
in
hayti
delaney
who
went
to
africa
concluded
a
treaty
with
eight
kings
offering
inducements
to
negroes
but
nothing
came
of
it
in
negroes
like
purvis
and
barbadoes
helped
in
the
formation
of
the
american
society
and
for
a
while
colored
men
coöperated
with
john
brown
and
probably
would
have
given
him
considerable
help
if
they
had
thoroughly
known
his
plans
as
it
was
six
or
seven
of
his
followers
were
negroes
meantime
the
slave
power
was
impelled
by
the
high
price
of
slaves
and
the
exhaustion
of
cotton
land
to
make
increased
demands
slavery
was
forced
north
of
mason
and
dixon
line
in
a
new
slave
empire
with
thousands
of
slaves
was
annexed
in
and
a
fugitive
slave
law
was
passed
which
endangered
the
liberty
of
every
free
negro
finally
a
determined
attempt
was
made
to
force
slavery
into
the
northwest
in
competition
with
free
white
labor
and
less
effective
but
powerful
movements
arose
to
annex
more
slave
territory
to
the
south
and
to
reopen
the
african
slave
trade
it
looked
like
a
triumphal
march
for
the
slave
barons
but
each
step
cost
more
than
the
last
missouri
gave
rise
to
the
early
abolitionist
movement
mexico
and
the
fugitive
slave
law
aroused
deep
opposition
in
the
north
and
kansas
developed
an
attack
upon
the
free
labor
system
not
simply
of
the
north
but
of
the
civilized
world
the
result
was
war
but
the
war
was
not
against
slavery
it
was
fought
to
protect
free
white
laborers
against
the
competition
of
slaves
and
it
was
thought
possible
to
do
this
by
segregating
slavery
the
first
thing
that
vexed
the
northern
armies
on
southern
soil
during
the
war
was
the
question
of
the
disposition
of
the
fugitive
slaves
who
immediately
began
to
arrive
in
increasing
numbers
butler
confiscated
them
fremont
freed
them
and
halleck
caught
and
returned
them
but
their
numbers
swelled
to
such
large
proportions
that
the
mere
economic
problem
of
their
presence
overshadowed
everything
else
especially
after
the
emancipation
proclamation
lincoln
was
glad
to
have
them
come
after
once
he
realized
their
strength
to
the
confederacy
the
emancipation
proclamation
was
forced
not
simply
by
the
necessity
of
paralyzing
industry
in
the
south
but
also
by
the
necessity
of
employing
negro
soldiers
during
the
first
two
years
of
the
war
no
one
wanted
negro
soldiers
it
was
declared
to
be
a
white
man
war
general
hunter
tried
to
raise
a
regiment
in
south
carolina
but
the
war
department
disavowed
the
act
in
louisiana
the
negroes
were
anxious
to
enlist
but
were
held
off
in
the
meantime
the
war
did
not
go
as
well
as
the
north
had
hoped
and
on
the
of
january
the
secretary
of
war
authorized
the
governor
of
massachusetts
to
raise
two
regiments
of
negro
troops
frederick
douglass
and
others
began
the
work
with
enthusiasm
and
in
the
end
one
hundred
and
thousand
negroes
enlisted
in
the
northern
armies
of
whom
seventy
thousand
were
killed
and
wounded
the
conduct
of
these
troops
was
exemplary
they
were
indispensable
in
camp
duties
and
brave
on
the
field
where
they
fought
in
two
hundred
and
thirteen
battles
general
banks
wrote
their
conduct
was
heroic
no
troops
could
be
more
determined
or
more
daring
the
assault
on
fort
wagner
led
by
a
thousand
black
soldiers
under
the
white
colonel
shaw
is
one
of
the
greatest
deeds
of
desperate
bravery
on
record
on
the
other
hand
the
treatment
of
negro
soldiers
when
captured
by
the
confederates
was
barbarous
at
fort
pillow
after
the
surrender
of
the
federal
troops
the
colored
regiment
was
indiscriminately
butchered
and
some
of
them
were
buried
alive
abraham
lincoln
said
the
slightest
knowledge
of
arithmetic
will
prove
to
any
man
that
the
rebel
armies
can
not
be
destroyed
with
democratic
strategy
it
would
sacrifice
all
the
white
men
of
the
north
to
do
it
there
are
now
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
near
two
hundred
thousand
colored
men
most
of
them
under
arms
defending
and
acquiring
union
territory
abandon
all
the
posts
now
garrisoned
by
black
men
take
two
hundred
thousand
men
from
our
side
and
put
them
in
the
battlefield
or
cornfield
against
us
and
we
would
be
compelled
to
abandon
the
war
in
three
weeks
emancipation
thus
came
as
a
war
measure
to
break
the
power
of
the
confederacy
preserve
the
union
and
gain
the
sympathy
of
the
civilized
world
however
two
hundred
and
years
of
slavery
could
not
be
stopped
by
edict
there
were
legal
difficulties
the
whole
slow
problem
of
economic
readjustment
and
the
subtle
and
questions
of
future
race
relations
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
emancipation
forced
the
legal
and
political
difficulties
to
the
front
and
these
were
so
striking
that
they
have
since
obscured
the
others
in
the
eyes
of
students
quite
unexpectedly
and
without
forethought
the
nation
had
emancipated
four
million
slaves
once
the
deed
was
done
the
majority
of
the
nation
was
glad
and
recognized
that
this
was
after
all
the
only
result
of
a
fearful
four
years
war
which
in
any
degree
justified
it
but
how
was
the
result
to
be
secured
for
all
time
there
were
three
possibilities
to
declare
the
slave
free
and
leave
him
at
the
mercy
of
his
former
masters
to
establish
a
careful
government
guardianship
designed
to
guide
the
slave
from
legal
to
real
economic
freedom
to
give
the
negro
the
political
power
to
guard
himself
as
well
as
he
could
during
this
development
it
is
very
easy
to
forget
that
the
united
states
government
tried
each
one
of
these
in
succession
and
was
literally
forced
to
adopt
the
third
because
the
first
had
utterly
failed
and
the
second
was
thought
too
paternal
and
especially
too
costly
to
leave
the
negroes
helpless
after
a
paper
edict
of
emancipation
was
manifestly
impossible
it
would
have
meant
that
the
war
had
been
fought
in
vain
carl
schurz
who
traversed
the
south
just
after
the
war
said
a
veritable
reign
of
terror
prevailed
in
many
parts
of
the
south
the
negro
found
scant
justice
in
the
local
courts
against
the
white
man
he
could
look
for
protection
only
to
the
military
forces
of
the
united
states
still
garrisoning
the
states
lately
in
rebellion
and
to
the
bureau
this
freedmen
bureau
was
proposed
by
charles
sumner
if
it
had
been
presented
instead
of
fifty
years
ago
it
would
have
been
regarded
as
a
proposal
far
less
revolutionary
than
the
state
insurance
of
england
and
germany
a
half
century
ago
however
and
in
a
country
which
gave
the
economics
their
extremest
trial
the
bureau
struck
the
whole
nation
as
unthinkable
save
as
a
very
temporary
expedient
and
to
relieve
the
more
pointed
forms
of
distress
following
war
yet
the
proposals
of
the
bureau
were
both
simple
and
sensible
to
oversee
the
making
and
enforcement
of
wage
contracts
for
freedmen
to
appear
in
the
courts
as
the
freedmen
best
friend
to
furnish
the
freedmen
with
a
minimum
of
land
and
of
capital
to
establish
schools
to
furnish
such
institutions
of
relief
as
hospitals
outdoor
relief
stations
etc
how
a
sensible
people
could
expect
really
to
conduct
a
slave
into
freedom
with
less
than
this
it
is
hard
to
see
even
with
such
tutelage
extending
over
a
period
of
two
or
three
decades
the
ultimate
end
had
to
be
enfranchisement
and
political
and
social
freedom
for
those
freedmen
who
attained
a
certain
set
standard
otherwise
the
whole
training
had
neither
object
nor
guarantee
precisely
on
this
account
the
former
masters
opposed
the
freedmen
bureau
with
all
their
influence
they
did
not
want
the
negro
trained
or
really
freed
and
they
criticized
mercilessly
the
many
mistakes
of
the
new
bureau
the
north
at
first
thought
to
pay
for
the
main
cost
of
the
bureau
by
confiscating
the
property
of
former
slave
owners
but
finding
this
not
in
accordance
with
law
they
realized
that
they
were
embarking
on
an
enterprise
which
bade
fair
to
add
many
millions
to
the
already
staggering
cost
of
the
war
when
therefore
they
saw
that
the
abolition
of
slavery
could
not
be
left
to
the
white
south
and
could
not
be
done
by
the
north
without
time
and
money
they
determined
to
put
the
responsibility
on
the
negro
himself
this
was
without
a
doubt
a
tremendous
experiment
but
with
all
its
manifest
mistakes
it
succeeded
to
an
astonishing
degree
it
made
the
immediate
reëstablishment
of
the
old
slavery
impossible
and
it
was
probably
the
only
quick
method
of
doing
this
it
gave
the
freedmen
sons
a
chance
to
begin
their
education
it
diverted
the
energy
of
the
white
south
slavery
to
the
recovery
of
political
power
and
in
this
interval
small
as
it
was
the
negro
took
his
first
steps
toward
economic
freedom
the
difficulties
that
stared
reconstruction
politicians
in
the
face
were
these
they
must
act
quickly
emancipation
had
increased
the
political
power
of
the
south
by
could
this
increased
political
power
be
put
in
the
hands
of
those
who
in
defense
of
slavery
had
disrupted
the
union
how
was
the
abolition
of
slavery
to
be
made
effective
what
was
to
be
the
political
position
of
the
freedmen
the
freedmen
bureau
in
its
short
life
accomplished
a
great
task
carl
schurz
in
felt
warranted
in
saying
that
not
half
of
the
labor
that
has
been
done
in
the
south
this
year
or
will
be
done
there
next
year
would
have
been
or
would
be
done
but
for
the
exertions
of
the
bureau
no
other
agency
except
one
placed
there
by
the
national
government
could
have
wielded
that
moral
power
whose
interposition
was
so
necessary
to
prevent
southern
society
from
falling
at
once
into
the
chaos
of
a
general
collision
between
its
different
elements
notwithstanding
this
the
bureau
was
temporary
was
regarded
as
a
makeshift
and
soon
abandoned
meantime
partial
negro
suffrage
seemed
not
only
just
but
almost
inevitable
lincoln
in
cautiously
suggested
to
private
consideration
whether
some
of
the
colored
people
may
not
be
let
in
as
for
instance
the
very
intelligent
and
especially
those
who
fought
gallantly
in
our
ranks
they
would
probably
help
in
some
trying
time
to
come
to
keep
the
jewel
of
liberty
in
the
family
of
freedom
indeed
the
family
of
freedom
in
louisiana
being
somewhat
small
just
then
who
else
was
to
be
intrusted
with
the
jewel
later
and
for
different
reasons
johnson
in
wrote
to
mississippi
if
you
could
extend
the
elective
franchise
to
all
persons
of
color
who
can
read
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
english
and
write
their
name
and
to
all
persons
of
color
who
own
real
estate
valued
at
not
less
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
and
pay
taxes
thereon
you
would
completely
disarm
the
adversary
and
set
an
example
the
other
states
will
follow
this
you
can
do
with
perfect
safety
and
you
thus
place
the
southern
states
in
reference
to
free
persons
of
color
upon
the
same
basis
with
the
free
states
i
hope
and
trust
your
convention
will
do
this
the
negroes
themselves
began
to
ask
for
the
suffrage
the
georgia
convention
in
augusta
advocated
a
proposition
to
give
those
who
could
write
and
read
well
and
possessed
a
certain
property
qualification
the
right
of
suffrage
the
reply
of
the
south
to
these
suggestions
was
decisive
in
tennessee
alone
was
any
action
attempted
that
even
suggested
possible
negro
suffrage
in
the
future
and
that
failed
in
all
other
states
the
black
codes
adopted
were
certainly
not
reassuring
to
the
friends
of
freedom
to
be
sure
it
was
not
a
time
to
look
for
calm
cool
thoughtful
action
on
the
part
of
the
white
south
their
economic
condition
was
pitiable
their
fear
of
negro
freedom
genuine
yet
it
was
reasonable
to
expect
from
them
something
less
than
repression
and
utter
reaction
toward
slavery
to
some
extent
this
expectation
was
fulfilled
the
abolition
of
slavery
was
recognized
on
the
statute
book
and
the
civil
rights
of
owning
property
and
appearing
as
a
witness
in
cases
in
which
he
was
a
party
were
generally
granted
the
negro
yet
with
these
in
many
cases
went
harsh
and
unbearable
regulations
which
largely
neutralized
the
concessions
and
certainly
gave
ground
for
an
assumption
that
once
free
the
south
would
virtually
reenslave
the
negro
the
colored
people
themselves
naturally
feared
this
protesting
as
in
mississippi
against
the
reactionary
policy
prevailing
and
expressing
the
fear
that
the
legislature
will
pass
such
prescriptive
laws
as
will
drive
the
freedmen
from
the
state
or
practically
reënslave
them
the
codes
spoke
for
themselves
as
burgess
says
almost
every
act
word
or
gesture
of
the
negro
not
consonant
with
good
taste
and
good
manners
as
well
as
good
morals
was
made
a
crime
or
misdemeanor
for
which
he
could
first
be
fined
by
the
magistrates
and
then
be
consigned
to
a
condition
of
almost
slavery
for
an
indefinite
time
if
he
could
not
pay
the
bill
all
things
considered
it
seems
probable
that
if
the
south
had
been
permitted
to
have
its
way
in
the
harshness
of
negro
slavery
would
have
been
mitigated
so
as
to
make
slave
trading
difficult
and
so
as
to
make
it
possible
for
a
negro
to
hold
property
and
appear
in
some
cases
in
court
but
that
in
most
other
respects
the
blacks
would
have
remained
in
slavery
what
could
prevent
this
a
freedmen
bureau
established
for
ten
twenty
or
forty
years
with
a
careful
distribution
of
land
and
capital
and
a
system
of
education
for
the
children
might
have
prevented
such
an
extension
of
slavery
but
the
country
would
not
listen
to
such
a
comprehensive
plan
a
restricted
grant
of
the
suffrage
voluntarily
made
by
the
states
would
have
been
a
reassuring
proof
of
a
desire
to
treat
the
freedmen
fairly
and
would
have
balanced
in
part
at
least
the
increased
political
power
of
the
south
there
was
no
such
disposition
evident
in
louisiana
for
instance
under
the
proposed
reconstruction
not
one
negro
was
allowed
to
vote
though
at
that
very
time
the
wealthy
intelligent
free
colored
people
of
the
state
paid
taxes
on
property
assessed
at
fifteen
million
dollars
and
many
of
them
were
well
known
for
their
patriotic
zeal
and
love
for
the
union
thus
the
arguments
for
universal
negro
suffrage
from
the
start
were
strong
and
are
still
strong
and
no
one
would
question
their
strength
were
it
not
for
the
assumption
that
the
experiment
failed
frederick
douglass
said
to
president
johnson
your
noble
and
humane
predecessor
placed
in
our
hands
the
sword
to
assist
in
saving
the
nation
and
we
do
hope
that
you
his
able
successor
will
favorably
regard
the
placing
in
our
hands
the
ballot
with
which
to
save
ourselves
carl
schurz
wrote
it
is
idle
to
say
that
it
will
be
time
to
speak
of
negro
suffrage
when
the
whole
colored
race
will
be
educated
for
the
ballot
may
be
necessary
to
him
to
secure
his
education
the
granting
of
full
negro
suffrage
meant
one
of
two
alternatives
to
the
south
the
uplift
of
the
negro
for
sheer
this
is
what
schurz
and
the
saner
north
expected
as
one
southern
school
superintendent
said
the
elevation
of
this
class
is
a
matter
of
prime
importance
since
a
ballot
in
the
hands
of
a
black
citizen
is
quite
as
potent
as
in
the
hands
of
a
white
one
or
negro
suffrage
meant
a
determined
concentration
of
southern
effort
by
actual
force
to
deprive
the
negro
of
the
ballot
or
nullify
its
use
this
last
is
what
really
happened
but
even
in
this
case
so
much
energy
was
taken
in
keeping
the
negro
from
voting
that
the
plan
for
keeping
him
in
virtual
slavery
and
denying
him
education
partially
failed
it
took
ten
years
to
nullify
negro
suffrage
in
part
and
twenty
years
to
escape
the
fear
of
federal
intervention
in
these
twenty
years
a
vast
number
of
negroes
had
arisen
so
far
as
to
escape
slavery
forever
debt
peonage
could
be
fastened
on
part
of
the
rural
south
and
was
but
even
here
the
new
negro
landholder
appeared
thus
despite
everything
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
that
alone
struck
the
death
knell
of
slavery
the
steps
toward
the
fifteenth
amendment
were
taken
slowly
first
negroes
were
allowed
to
take
part
in
reconstructing
the
state
governments
this
was
inevitable
if
loyal
governments
were
to
be
obtained
next
the
restored
state
governments
were
directed
to
enfranchise
all
citizens
black
or
white
or
have
their
representation
in
congress
cut
down
proportionately
finally
the
united
states
said
the
last
word
of
simple
justice
the
states
may
regulate
the
suffrage
but
no
state
may
deprive
a
person
of
the
right
to
vote
simply
because
he
is
a
negro
or
has
been
a
slave
for
such
reasons
the
negro
was
enfranchised
what
was
the
result
no
language
has
been
spared
to
describe
these
results
as
the
worst
imaginable
this
is
not
true
there
were
bad
results
and
bad
results
arising
from
negro
suffrage
but
those
results
were
not
so
bad
as
usually
painted
nor
was
negro
suffrage
the
prime
cause
of
many
of
them
let
us
not
forget
that
the
white
south
believed
it
to
be
of
vital
interest
to
its
welfare
that
the
experiment
of
negro
suffrage
should
fail
ignominiously
and
that
almost
to
a
man
the
whites
were
willing
to
insure
this
failure
either
by
active
force
or
passive
acquiescence
that
besides
this
there
were
as
might
be
expected
men
black
and
white
northern
and
southern
only
too
eager
to
take
advantage
of
such
a
situation
for
feathering
their
own
nests
much
evil
must
result
in
such
case
but
to
charge
the
evil
to
negro
suffrage
is
unfair
it
may
be
charged
to
anger
poverty
venality
and
ignorance
but
the
anger
and
poverty
were
the
almost
inevitable
aftermath
of
war
the
venality
was
much
greater
among
whites
than
negroes
both
north
and
south
and
while
ignorance
was
the
curse
of
negroes
the
fault
was
not
theirs
and
they
took
the
initiative
to
correct
it
the
chief
charges
against
the
negro
governments
are
extravagance
theft
and
incompetency
of
officials
there
is
no
serious
charge
that
these
governments
threatened
civilization
or
the
foundations
of
social
order
the
charge
is
that
they
threatened
property
and
that
they
were
inefficient
these
charges
are
in
part
undoubtedly
true
but
they
are
often
exaggerated
the
south
had
been
terribly
impoverished
and
saddled
with
new
social
burdens
in
other
words
states
with
smaller
resources
were
asked
not
only
to
do
a
work
of
restoration
but
a
larger
social
work
the
property
holders
were
aghast
they
not
only
demurred
but
predicting
ruin
and
revolution
they
appealed
to
secret
societies
to
intimidation
force
and
murder
they
refused
to
believe
that
these
novices
in
government
and
their
friends
were
aught
but
scamps
and
fools
under
the
circumstances
occurring
directly
after
the
war
the
wisest
statesman
would
have
been
compelled
to
resort
to
increased
taxation
and
would
have
in
turn
been
execrated
as
extravagant
dishonest
and
incompetent
it
is
easy
therefore
to
see
what
flaming
and
incredible
stories
of
reconstruction
governments
could
gain
wide
currency
and
belief
in
fact
the
extravagance
although
great
was
not
universal
and
much
of
it
was
due
to
the
extravagant
spirit
pervading
the
whole
country
in
a
day
of
inflated
currency
and
speculation
that
the
negroes
led
by
the
astute
thieves
became
at
first
tools
and
received
some
small
share
of
the
spoils
is
true
but
two
considerations
must
be
added
much
of
the
legislation
which
resulted
in
fraud
was
represented
to
the
negroes
as
good
legislation
and
thus
their
votes
were
secured
by
deliberate
misrepresentation
take
for
instance
the
land
frauds
of
south
carolina
a
wise
negro
leader
of
that
state
advocating
the
state
purchase
of
farm
lands
said
one
of
the
greatest
of
slavery
bulwarks
was
the
infernal
plantation
system
one
man
owning
his
thousand
another
his
twenty
another
fifty
thousand
acres
of
land
this
is
the
only
way
by
which
we
will
break
up
that
system
and
i
maintain
that
our
freedom
will
be
of
no
effect
if
we
allow
it
to
continue
what
is
the
main
cause
of
the
prosperity
of
the
north
it
is
because
every
man
has
his
own
farm
and
is
free
and
independent
let
the
lands
of
the
south
be
similarly
divided
from
such
arguments
the
negroes
were
induced
to
aid
a
scheme
to
buy
land
and
distribute
it
yet
a
large
part
of
eight
hundred
thousand
dollars
appropriated
was
wasted
and
went
to
the
white
landholders
pockets
the
most
inexcusable
cheating
of
the
negroes
took
place
through
the
freedmen
bank
this
bank
was
incorporated
by
congress
in
and
had
in
its
list
of
incorporators
some
of
the
greatest
names
in
america
including
peter
cooper
william
cullen
bryan
and
john
jay
yet
the
bank
was
allowed
to
fail
in
owing
the
freedmen
their
first
savings
of
over
three
millions
of
dollars
they
have
never
been
reimbursed
many
negroes
were
undoubtedly
venal
but
more
were
ignorant
and
deceived
the
question
is
did
they
show
any
signs
of
a
disposition
to
learn
to
better
things
the
theory
of
democratic
government
is
not
that
the
will
of
the
people
is
always
right
but
rather
that
normal
human
beings
of
average
intelligence
will
if
given
a
chance
learn
the
right
and
best
course
by
bitter
experience
this
is
precisely
what
the
negro
voters
showed
indubitable
signs
of
doing
first
they
strove
for
schools
to
abolish
ignorance
and
second
a
large
and
growing
number
of
them
revolted
against
the
extravagance
and
stealing
that
marred
the
beginning
of
reconstruction
and
joined
with
the
best
elements
to
institute
reform
the
greatest
stigma
on
the
white
south
is
not
that
it
opposed
negro
suffrage
and
resented
theft
and
incompetence
but
that
when
it
saw
the
reform
movements
growing
and
even
in
some
cases
triumphing
and
a
larger
and
larger
number
of
black
voters
learning
to
vote
for
honesty
and
ability
it
still
preferred
a
reign
of
terror
to
a
campaign
of
education
and
disfranchised
negroes
instead
of
punishing
rascals
no
one
has
expressed
this
more
convincingly
than
a
negro
who
was
himself
a
member
of
the
reconstruction
legislature
of
south
carolina
and
who
spoke
at
the
convention
which
disfranchised
him
against
one
of
the
onslaughts
of
tillman
we
were
eight
years
in
power
we
had
built
school
houses
established
charitable
institutions
built
and
maintained
the
penitentiary
system
provided
for
the
education
of
the
deaf
and
dumb
rebuilt
the
jails
and
court
houses
rebuilt
the
bridges
and
reestablished
the
ferries
in
short
we
had
reconstructed
the
state
and
placed
it
upon
the
road
to
prosperity
and
at
the
same
time
by
our
acts
of
financial
reform
transmitted
to
the
hampton
government
an
indebtedness
not
greater
by
more
than
two
and
a
half
million
dollars
than
was
the
bonded
debt
of
the
state
in
before
the
republican
negroes
and
their
white
allies
came
into
power
so
too
in
louisiana
in
and
in
mississippi
later
the
better
element
of
the
republicans
triumphed
at
the
polls
and
joining
with
the
democrats
instituted
reforms
repudiated
the
worst
extravagance
and
started
toward
better
things
unfortunately
there
was
one
thing
that
the
white
south
feared
more
than
negro
dishonesty
ignorance
and
incompetency
and
that
was
negro
honesty
knowledge
and
efficiency
in
the
midst
of
all
these
difficulties
the
negro
governments
in
the
south
accomplished
much
of
positive
good
we
may
recognize
three
things
which
negro
rule
gave
to
the
south
democratic
government
free
public
schools
new
social
legislation
in
general
the
words
of
judge
albion
tourgee
a
white
carpet
bagger
are
true
when
he
says
of
the
negro
governments
they
obeyed
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
annulled
the
bonds
of
states
counties
and
cities
which
had
been
issued
to
carry
on
the
war
of
rebellion
and
maintain
armies
in
the
field
against
the
union
they
instituted
a
public
school
system
in
a
realm
where
public
schools
had
been
unknown
they
opened
the
ballot
box
and
the
jury
box
to
thousands
of
white
men
who
had
been
debarred
from
them
by
a
lack
of
earthly
possessions
they
introduced
home
rule
into
the
south
they
abolished
the
whipping
post
the
branding
iron
the
stocks
and
other
barbarous
forms
of
punishment
which
had
up
to
that
time
prevailed
they
reduced
capital
felonies
from
about
twenty
to
two
or
three
in
an
age
of
extravagance
they
were
extravagant
in
the
sums
appropriated
for
public
works
in
all
of
that
time
no
rights
of
persons
were
invaded
under
the
forms
of
law
every
life
home
fireside
and
business
were
safe
no
man
obstructed
any
white
man
way
to
the
ballot
box
interfered
with
his
freedom
of
speech
or
boycotted
him
on
account
of
his
political
faith
a
thorough
study
of
the
legislation
accompanying
these
constitutions
and
its
changes
since
shows
the
comparatively
small
amount
of
change
in
law
and
government
which
the
overthrow
of
negro
rule
brought
about
there
were
sharp
and
often
hurtful
economies
introduced
marking
the
return
of
property
to
power
there
was
a
sweeping
change
of
officials
but
the
main
body
of
reconstruction
legislation
stood
the
reconstruction
democracy
brought
forth
new
leaders
and
definitely
overthrew
the
old
southern
aristocracy
among
these
new
men
were
negroes
of
worth
and
ability
john
lynch
when
speaker
of
the
mississippi
house
of
representatives
was
given
a
public
testimonial
by
republicans
and
democrats
and
the
leading
white
paper
said
his
bearing
in
office
had
been
so
proper
and
his
rulings
in
such
marked
contrasts
to
the
partisan
conduct
of
the
ignoble
whites
of
his
party
who
have
aspired
to
be
leaders
of
the
blacks
that
the
conservatives
cheerfully
joined
in
the
testimonial
of
the
colored
treasurer
of
south
carolina
the
white
governor
chamberlain
said
i
have
never
heard
one
word
or
seen
one
act
of
cardoza
which
did
not
confirm
my
confidence
in
his
personal
integrity
and
his
political
honor
and
zeal
for
the
honest
administration
of
the
state
government
on
every
occasion
and
under
all
circumstances
he
has
been
against
fraud
and
robbery
and
in
favor
of
good
measures
and
good
men
jonathan
gibbs
a
colored
man
and
the
first
state
superintendent
of
instruction
in
florida
was
a
graduate
of
dartmouth
he
established
the
system
and
brought
it
to
success
dying
in
harness
in
such
men
and
there
were
others
ought
not
to
be
forgotten
or
confounded
with
other
types
of
colored
and
white
reconstruction
leaders
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
thirst
of
the
black
man
for
knowledge
a
thirst
which
has
been
too
persistent
and
durable
to
be
mere
curiosity
or
whim
gave
birth
to
the
public
school
system
of
the
south
it
was
the
question
upon
which
black
voters
and
legislators
insisted
more
than
anything
else
and
while
it
is
possible
to
find
some
vestiges
of
free
schools
in
some
of
the
southern
states
before
the
war
yet
a
universal
system
dates
from
the
day
that
the
black
man
got
political
power
finally
in
legislation
covering
property
the
wider
functions
of
the
state
the
punishment
of
crime
and
the
like
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
the
laws
on
these
points
established
by
reconstruction
legislatures
were
not
only
different
from
and
even
revolutionary
to
the
laws
in
the
older
south
but
they
were
so
wise
and
so
well
suited
to
the
needs
of
the
new
south
that
in
spite
of
a
retrogressive
movement
following
the
overthrow
of
the
negro
governments
the
mass
of
this
legislation
with
elaborations
and
development
still
stands
on
the
statute
books
of
the
south
the
triumph
of
reaction
in
the
south
inaugurated
a
new
era
in
which
we
may
distinguish
three
phases
the
renewed
attempt
to
reduce
the
negroes
to
serfdom
the
rise
of
the
negro
metayer
and
the
economic
disfranchisement
of
the
southern
working
class
the
attempt
to
replace
individual
slavery
had
been
frustrated
by
the
freedmen
bureau
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
the
disfranchisement
of
was
followed
by
the
widespread
rise
of
crime
peonage
stringent
laws
on
vagrancy
guardianship
and
labor
contracts
were
enacted
and
large
discretion
given
judge
and
jury
in
cases
of
petty
crime
as
a
result
negroes
were
systematically
arrested
on
the
slightest
pretext
and
the
labor
of
convicts
leased
to
private
parties
this
convict
lease
system
was
almost
universal
in
the
south
until
about
when
its
outrageous
abuses
and
cruelties
aroused
the
whole
country
it
still
survives
over
wide
areas
and
is
not
only
responsible
for
the
impression
that
the
negro
is
a
natural
criminal
but
also
for
the
inability
of
the
southern
courts
to
perform
their
normal
functions
after
so
long
a
prostitution
to
ends
far
removed
from
justice
in
more
normal
economic
lines
the
employers
began
with
the
labor
contract
system
before
the
war
they
owned
labor
land
and
subsistence
after
the
war
they
still
held
the
land
and
subsistence
the
laborer
was
hired
and
the
subsistence
advanced
to
him
while
the
crop
was
growing
the
fall
of
the
freedmen
bureau
hindered
the
transmutation
of
this
system
into
a
modern
wage
system
and
allowed
the
laborers
to
be
cheated
by
high
interest
charges
on
the
subsistence
advanced
and
actual
cheating
often
in
book
accounts
the
black
laborers
became
deeply
dissatisfied
under
this
system
and
began
to
migrate
from
the
country
to
the
cities
where
there
was
an
increasing
demand
for
labor
the
employing
farmers
complained
bitterly
of
the
scarcity
of
labor
and
of
negro
laziness
and
secured
the
enactment
of
harsher
vagrancy
and
labor
contract
laws
and
statutes
against
the
enticement
of
laborers
so
severe
were
these
laws
that
it
was
often
impossible
for
a
laborer
to
stop
work
without
committing
a
felony
nevertheless
competition
compelled
the
landholders
to
offer
more
inducements
to
the
farm
hand
the
result
was
the
rise
of
the
black
share
tenant
the
laborer
securing
better
wages
saved
a
little
capital
and
began
to
hire
land
in
parcels
of
forty
to
eighty
acres
furnishing
his
own
tools
and
seed
and
practically
raising
his
own
subsistence
in
this
way
the
whole
face
of
the
labor
contract
in
the
south
was
in
the
decade
in
process
of
change
from
a
nominal
wage
contract
to
a
system
of
tenantry
the
great
plantations
were
apparently
broken
up
into
forty
and
eighty
acre
farms
with
black
farmers
to
many
it
seemed
that
emancipation
was
accomplished
and
the
black
folk
were
especially
filled
with
joy
and
hope
it
soon
was
evident
however
that
the
change
was
only
partial
the
landlord
still
held
the
land
in
large
parcels
he
rented
this
in
small
farms
to
tenants
but
retained
direct
control
in
theory
the
laborer
was
furnishing
capital
but
in
the
majority
of
cases
he
was
borrowing
at
least
a
part
of
this
capital
from
some
merchant
the
retail
merchant
in
this
way
entered
on
the
scene
as
middle
man
between
landlord
and
laborer
he
guaranteed
the
landowner
his
rent
and
relieved
him
of
details
by
taking
over
the
furnishing
of
supplies
to
the
laborer
he
tempted
the
laborer
by
a
larger
stock
of
more
attractive
goods
made
a
direct
contract
with
him
and
took
a
mortgage
on
the
growing
crop
thus
he
soon
became
the
middle
man
to
whom
the
profit
of
the
transaction
largely
flowed
and
he
began
to
get
rich
if
the
new
system
benefited
the
merchant
and
the
landlord
it
also
brought
some
benefits
to
the
black
laborers
numbers
of
these
were
still
held
in
peonage
and
the
mass
were
laborers
working
for
scant
board
and
clothes
but
above
these
began
to
rise
a
large
number
of
independent
tenants
and
farm
owners
in
therefore
the
south
was
faced
by
this
question
are
we
willing
to
allow
the
negro
to
advance
as
a
free
worker
peasant
farmer
metayer
and
small
capitalist
with
only
such
handicaps
as
naturally
impede
the
poor
and
ignorant
or
is
it
necessary
to
erect
further
artificial
barriers
to
restrain
the
advance
of
the
negroes
the
answer
was
clear
and
unmistakable
the
advance
of
the
freedmen
had
been
too
rapid
and
the
south
feared
it
every
effort
must
be
made
to
keep
the
negro
in
his
place
as
a
servile
caste
to
this
end
the
south
strove
to
make
the
disfranchisement
of
the
negroes
effective
and
final
up
to
this
time
disfranchisement
was
illegal
and
based
on
intimidation
the
new
laws
passed
between
and
sought
on
their
face
to
base
the
right
to
vote
on
property
and
education
in
such
a
way
as
to
exclude
poor
and
illiterate
negroes
and
admit
all
whites
in
fact
they
could
be
administered
so
as
to
exclude
nearly
all
negroes
to
this
was
added
a
series
of
laws
designed
publicly
to
humiliate
and
stigmatize
negro
blood
as
for
example
separate
railway
cars
separate
seats
in
street
cars
and
the
like
these
things
were
added
to
the
separation
in
schools
and
churches
and
the
denial
of
redress
to
seduced
colored
women
which
had
long
been
the
custom
in
the
south
all
these
new
enactments
meant
not
simply
separation
but
subordination
caste
humiliation
and
flagrant
injustice
to
all
this
was
added
a
series
of
labor
laws
making
the
exploitation
of
negro
labor
more
secure
all
this
legislation
had
to
be
accomplished
in
the
face
of
the
labor
movement
throughout
the
world
and
particularly
in
the
south
where
it
was
beginning
to
enter
among
the
white
workers
this
was
accomplished
easily
however
by
an
appeal
to
race
prejudice
no
method
of
inflaming
the
darkest
passions
of
men
was
unused
the
lynching
mob
was
given
its
glut
of
blood
and
egged
on
by
purposely
exaggerated
and
often
wholly
invented
tales
of
crime
on
the
part
of
perhaps
the
most
peaceful
and
race
the
world
has
ever
known
under
the
flame
of
this
outward
noise
went
the
more
subtle
and
dangerous
work
the
election
laws
passed
in
the
states
where
of
the
negroes
live
were
so
ingeniously
framed
that
a
black
university
graduate
could
be
prevented
from
voting
and
the
most
ignorant
white
hoodlum
could
be
admitted
to
the
polls
labor
laws
were
so
arranged
that
imprisonment
for
debt
was
possible
and
leaving
an
employer
could
be
made
a
penitentiary
offense
negro
schools
were
cut
off
with
small
appropriations
or
wholly
neglected
and
a
determined
effort
was
made
with
wide
success
to
see
that
no
negro
had
any
voice
either
in
the
making
or
the
administration
of
local
state
or
national
law
the
acquiescence
of
the
white
labor
vote
of
the
south
was
further
insured
by
throwing
white
and
black
laborers
so
far
as
possible
into
rival
competing
groups
and
making
each
feel
that
the
one
was
the
cause
of
the
other
troubles
the
neutrality
of
the
white
people
of
the
north
was
secured
through
their
fear
for
the
safety
of
large
investments
in
the
south
and
through
the
fatalistic
attitude
common
both
in
america
and
europe
toward
the
possibility
of
real
advance
on
the
part
of
the
darker
nations
the
reaction
of
the
negro
americans
upon
this
wholesale
and
open
attempt
to
reduce
them
to
serfdom
has
been
interesting
naturally
they
began
to
organize
and
protest
and
in
some
cases
to
appeal
to
the
courts
then
to
their
astonishment
there
arose
a
colored
leader
booker
washington
who
advised
them
to
yield
to
disfranchisement
and
caste
and
wait
for
greater
economic
strength
and
general
efficiency
before
demanding
full
rights
as
american
citizens
the
white
south
naturally
agreed
with
washington
and
the
white
north
thought
they
saw
here
a
chance
for
peace
in
the
racial
conflict
and
safety
for
their
southern
investments
for
a
time
the
colored
people
hesitated
they
respected
washington
for
shrewdness
and
recognized
the
wisdom
of
his
homely
insistence
on
thrift
and
hard
work
but
gradually
they
came
to
see
more
and
more
clearly
that
stripped
of
political
power
and
emasculated
by
caste
they
could
never
gain
sufficient
economic
strength
to
take
their
place
as
modern
men
they
also
realized
that
any
lull
in
their
protests
would
be
taken
advantage
of
by
negro
haters
to
push
their
caste
program
they
began
therefore
with
renewed
persistence
to
fight
for
their
fundamental
rights
as
american
citizens
the
struggle
tended
at
first
to
bitter
personal
dissension
within
the
group
but
wiser
counsels
and
the
advice
of
white
friends
eventually
prevailed
and
raised
it
to
the
broad
level
of
a
fight
for
the
fundamental
principles
of
democracy
the
launching
of
the
niagara
movement
by
daring
colored
men
in
followed
by
the
formation
of
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
in
marked
an
epoch
in
the
advance
of
the
negro
this
latter
organization
with
its
monthly
organ
is
now
waging
a
fight
for
justice
to
negroes
other
organizations
and
a
number
of
strong
negro
weekly
papers
are
aiding
in
this
fight
what
has
been
the
net
result
of
this
struggle
of
half
a
century
in
there
were
about
five
million
persons
of
negro
descent
in
the
united
states
of
these
four
million
and
more
were
just
being
released
from
slavery
these
slaves
could
be
bought
and
sold
could
move
from
place
to
place
only
with
permission
were
forbidden
to
learn
to
read
or
write
and
legally
could
never
hold
property
or
marry
ninety
per
cent
were
totally
illiterate
and
only
one
adult
in
six
was
a
nominal
christian
fifty
years
later
in
there
were
in
the
united
states
ten
and
a
quarter
million
persons
of
negro
descent
an
increase
of
one
hundred
and
five
per
cent
legal
slavery
has
been
abolished
leaving
however
vestiges
in
debt
slavery
peonage
and
the
convict
lease
system
the
mass
of
the
freedmen
and
their
sons
have
earned
a
living
as
free
and
partially
free
laborers
shared
the
responsibilities
of
government
developed
the
internal
organization
of
their
race
aspired
to
spiritual
the
negro
was
freed
as
a
penniless
landless
naked
ignorant
laborer
there
were
a
few
free
negroes
who
owned
property
in
the
south
and
a
larger
number
who
owned
property
in
the
north
but
per
cent
of
the
race
in
the
south
were
penniless
field
hands
and
servants
there
are
two
and
a
half
million
laborers
the
majority
of
whom
are
efficient
wage
earners
above
these
are
more
than
a
million
servants
and
tenant
farmers
skilled
and
workers
make
another
million
and
at
the
top
of
the
economic
column
are
owners
and
managers
of
farms
and
businesses
cash
tenants
officials
and
professional
men
this
makes
a
total
of
colored
breadwinners
in
more
specifically
these
breadwinners
include
farm
owners
and
cash
farm
tenants
and
managers
there
were
in
all
miners
in
the
building
and
hand
trades
workers
in
clay
glass
and
stone
iron
and
steel
workers
employees
on
railways
draymen
cab
drivers
and
liverymen
in
wholesale
and
retail
trade
in
the
public
service
and
in
professional
service
including
teachers
clergymen
and
physicians
dentists
trained
nurses
etc
finally
we
must
not
forget
negro
homes
with
their
housewives
and
children
in
school
fifty
years
ago
the
overwhelming
mass
of
these
people
were
not
only
penniless
but
were
themselves
assessed
as
real
estate
by
the
negroes
probably
had
gotten
hold
of
something
between
and
acres
of
land
through
their
bounties
as
soldiers
and
the
low
price
of
land
after
the
war
by
this
was
increased
to
about
acres
in
to
about
acres
in
to
over
acres
in
this
land
had
increased
to
nearly
acres
a
realm
as
large
as

the
negro
problems
it
is
impossible
to
separate
the
population
of
the
world
accurately
by
race
since
that
is
no
scientific
criterion
by
which
to
divide
races
if
we
divide
the
world
however
roughly
into
african
negroes
and
negroids
european
whites
and
asiatic
and

brown

and
in

what
is
to
be
the
future
relation
of
the
negro
race
to
the
rest
of
the
world
the
visitor
from
altruria
might
see
here
no
peculiar
problem
he
would
expect
the
negro
race
to
develop
along
the
lines
of
other
human
races
in
africa
his
economic
and
political
development
would
restore
and
eventually
outrun
the
ancient
glories
of
egypt
ethiopia
and
yoruba
overseas
the
west
indies
would
become
a
new
and
nobler
africa
built
in
the
very
pathway
of
the
new
highway
of
commerce
between
east
and
west
the
real
sea
route
to
india
while
in
the
united
states
a
large
part
of
its
citizenship
showing
for
perhaps
centuries
their
dark
descent
but
nevertheless
equal
sharers
of
and
contributors
to
the
civilization
of
the
west
would
be
the
descendants
of
the
wretched
victims
of
the
seventeenth
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
century
slave
trade
this
natural
assumption
of
a
stranger
finds
however
lodging
in
the
minds
of
few
thinkers
on
the
contrary
such
an
outcome
is
usually
dismissed
summarily
most
persons
have
accepted
that
tacit
but
clear
modern
philosophy
which
assigns
to
the
white
race
alone
the
hegemony
of
the
world
and
assumes
that
other
races
and
particularly
the
negro
race
will
either
be
content
to
serve
the
interests
of
the
whites
or
die
out
before
their
march
this
philosophy
is
the
child
of
the
african
slave
trade
and
of
the
expansion
of
europe
during
the
nineteenth
century
the
negro
slave
trade
was
the
first
step
in
modern
world
commerce
followed
by
the
modern
theory
of
colonial
expansion
slaves
as
an
article
of
commerce
were
shipped
as
long
as
the
traffic
paid
when
the
americas
had
enough
black
laborers
for
their
immediate
demand
the
moral
action
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
a
chance
to
make
its
faint
voice
heard
the
moral
repugnance
was
powerfully
reënforced
by
the
revolt
of
the
slaves
in
the
west
indies
and
south
america
and
by
the
fact
that
north
america
early
began
to
regard
itself
as
the
seat
of
advanced
ideas
in
politics
religion
and
humanity
finally
european
capital
began
to
find
better
investments
than
slave
shipping
and
flew
to
them
these
better
investments
were
the
fruit
of
the
new
industrial
revolution
of
the
nineteenth
century
with
its
factory
system
they
were
also
in
part
the
result
of
the
cheapened
price
of
gold
and
silver
brought
about
by
slavery
and
the
slave
trade
to
the
new
world
commodities
other
than
gold
and
commodities
capable
of
manufacture
and
exploitation
in
europe
out
of
materials
furnishable
by
america
became
enhanced
in
value
the
bottom
fell
out
of
the
commercial
slave
trade
and
its
suppression
became
possible
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
saw
the
beginning
of
the
rise
of
the
modern
working
class
by
means
of
political
power
the
laborers
slowly
but
surely
began
to
demand
a
larger
share
in
the
profiting
industry
in
the
united
states
their
demand
bade
fair
to
be
halted
by
the
competition
of
slave
labor
the
labor
vote
therefore
first
confined
slavery
to
limits
in
which
it
could
not
live
and
when
the
slave
power
sought
to
exceed
these
territorial
limits
it
was
suddenly
and
unintentionally
abolished
as
the
emancipation
of
millions
of
dark
workers
took
place
in
the
west
indies
north
and
south
america
and
parts
of
africa
at
this
time
it
was
natural
to
assume
that
the
uplift
of
this
working
class
lay
along
the
same
paths
with
that
of
european
and
american
whites
this
was
the
suggested
solution
of
the
negro
problem
consequently
these
negroes
received
partial
enfranchisement
the
beginnings
of
education
and
some
of
the
elementary
rights
of
wage
earners
and
property
holders
while
the
independence
of
liberia
and
hayti
was
recognized
however
long
before
they
were
strong
enough
to
assert
the
rights
thus
granted
or
to
gather
intelligence
enough
for
proper
group
leadership
the
new
colonialism
of
the
later
nineteenth
and
twentieth
centuries
began
to
dawn
the
new
colonial
theory
transferred
the
reign
of
commercial
privilege
and
extraordinary
profit
from
the
exploitation
of
the
european
working
class
to
the
exploitation
of
backward
races
under
the
political
domination
of
europe
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
this
idea
the
european
and
white
american
working
class
was
practically
invited
to
share
in
this
new
exploitation
and
particularly
were
flattered
by
popular
appeals
to
their
inherent
superiority
to
dagoes
chinks
japs
and
niggers
this
tendency
was
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
the
new
colonial
expansion
centered
in
africa
thus
in
something
less
than
of
africa
was
under
nominal
european
control
but
the
war
and
the
exploration
of
the
congo
led
to
new
and
fateful
things
germany
desired
economic
expansion
and
being
shut
out
from
america
by
the
monroe
doctrine
turned
to
africa
france
humiliated
in
war
dreamed
of
an
african
empire
from
the
atlantic
to
the
red
sea
italy
became
ambitious
for
tripoli
and
abyssinia
great
britain
began
to
take
new
interest
in
her
african
realm
but
found
herself
largely
checkmated
by
the
jealousy
of
all
europe
portugal
sought
to
make
good
her
ancient
claim
to
the
larger
part
of
the
whole
southern
peninsula
it
was
leopold
of
belgium
who
started
to
make
the
exploration
and
civilization
of
africa
an
international
movement
this
project
failed
and
the
congo
free
state
became
in
time
simply
a
belgian
colony
while
the
project
was
under
discussion
the
international
scramble
for
africa
began
as
a
result
the
berlin
conference
and
subsequent
wars
and
treaties
gave
great
britain
control
of
square
miles
of
african
territory
in
addition
to
egypt
and
the
egyptian
sudan
with
square
miles
this
includes
south
africa
bechuanaland
and
rhodesia
east
africa
uganda
and
zanzibar
nigeria
and
british
west
africa
the
french
hold
square
miles
including
nearly
all
north
africa
except
tripoli
west
of
the
niger
valley
and
libyan
desert
and
touching
the
atlantic
at
four
points
to
this
is
added
the
island
of
madagascar
the
germans
have
square
miles
principally
in
southeast
and
africa
and
the
kamerun
the
portuguese
retain
square
miles
in
southeast
and
southwest
africa
the
belgians
have
square
miles
while
liberia
square
miles
and
abyssinia
square
miles
are
independent
the
italians
have
about
square
miles
and
the
spanish
less
than
square
miles
this
partition
of
africa
brought
revision
of
the
ideas
of
negro
uplift
why
was
it
necessary
the
european
investors
argued
to
push
a
continent
of
black
workers
along
the
paths
of
social
uplift
by
education
property
holding
and
the
electoral
franchise
when
the
workers
desired
no
change
and
the
rate
of
european
profit
would
suffer
there
quickly
arose
then
the
suggestion
for
settling
the
negro
problem
it
called
for
the
virtual
enslavement
of
natives
in
certain
industries
as
rubber
and
ivory
collecting
in
the
belgian
congo
cocoa
raising
in
portuguese
angola
and
diamond
mining
in
south
africa
this
new
slavery
or
forced
labor
was
stoutly
defended
as
a
necessary
foundation
for
implanting
modern
industry
in
a
barbarous
land
but
its
likeness
to
slavery
was
too
clear
and
it
has
been
modified
but
not
wholly
abolished
the
attempted
solution
of
the
negro
sought
the
result
of
the
by
less
direct
methods
negroes
in
africa
the
west
indies
and
america
were
to
be
forced
to
work
by
land
monopoly
taxation
and
little
or
no
education
in
this
way
a
docile
industrial
class
working
for
low
wages
and
not
intelligent
enough
to
unite
in
labor
unions
was
to
be
developed
the
peonage
systems
in
parts
of
the
united
states
and
the
labor
systems
of
many
of
the
african
colonies
of
great
britain
and
germany
illustrate
this
phase
of
solution
it
is
also
illustrated
in
many
of
the
west
indian
islands
where
we
have
a
predominant
negro
population
and
this
population
freed
from
slavery
and
partially
enfranchised
land
and
capital
however
have
for
the
most
part
been
so
managed
and
monopolized
that
the
black
peasantry
have
been
reduced
to
straits
to
earn
a
living
in
one
of
the
richest
parts
of
the
world
the
problem
is
now
going
to
be
intensified
when
the
world
commerce
begins
to
sweep
through
the
panama
canal
all
these
solutions
and
methods
however
run
directly
counter
to
modern
philanthropy
and
have
to
be
carried
on
with
a
certain
concealment
and
which
is
not
only
distasteful
in
itself
but
always
liable
to
be
discovered
and
exposed
by
some
liberal
or
religious
movement
of
the
masses
of
men
and
suddenly
overthrown
these
solutions
are
therefore
gradually
merging
into
a
solution
which
is
very
popular
this
solution
says
negroes
differ
from
whites
in
their
inherent
genius
and
stage
of
development
their
development
must
not
therefore
be
sought
along
european
lines
but
along
their
own
native
lines
consequently
the
effort
is
made
in
british
nigeria
in
the
french
congo
and
sudan
in
uganda
and
rhodesia
to
leave
so
far
as
possible
the
outward
structure
of
native
life
intact
the
king
or
chief
reigns
the
popular
assemblies
meet
and
act
the
native
courts
adjudicate
and
native
social
and
family
life
and
religion
prevail
all
this
however
is
subject
to
the
veto
and
command
of
a
european
magistracy
supported
by
a
native
army
with
european
officers
the
advantage
of
this
method
is
that
on
its
face
it
carries
no
clue
to
its
real
working
indeed
it
can
always
point
to
certain
undoubted
advantages
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
the
suppression
of
war
and
feud
the
encouragement
of
peaceful
industry
on
the
other
hand
back
of
practically
all
these
experiments
stands
the
economic
motive
the
determination
to
use
the
organization
the
land
and
the
people
not
for
their
own
benefit
but
for
the
benefit
of
white
europe
for
this
reason
education
is
seldom
encouraged
modern
religious
ideas
are
carefully
limited
sound
political
development
is
sternly
frowned
upon
and
industry
is
degraded
and
changed
to
the
demands
of
european
markets
the
most
ruthless
class
of
white
mercantile
exploiters
is
allowed
large
liberty
if
not
a
free
hand
and
protected
by
a
concerted
attempt
to
deify
white
men
as
such
in
the
eyes
of
the
native
and
in
their
own
imagination
white
missionary
societies
are
spending
perhaps
as
much
as
five
million
dollars
a
year
in
africa
and
accomplishing
much
good
but
at
the
same
time
white
merchants
are
sending
at
least
twenty
million
dollars
worth
of
european
liquor
into
africa
each
year
and
the
debauchery
of
the
almost
unrestricted
rum
traffic
goes
far
to
neutralize
missionary
effort
illustration
distribution
of
negro
blood
ancient
and
modern
under
this
last
mentioned
solution
of
the
negro
problems
we
may
put
the
attempts
at
the
segregation
of
negroes
and
mulattoes
in
the
united
states
and
to
some
extent
in
the
west
indies
ostensibly
this
is
separation
of
the
races
in
society
civil
rights
etc
in
practice
it
is
the
subordination
of
colored
people
of
all
grades
under
white
tutelage
and
their
separation
as
far
as
possible
from
contact
with
civilization
in
dwelling
place
in
education
and
in
public
life
on
the
other
hand
the
economic
significance
of
the
negro
is
tremendous
black
africa
exports
annually
nearly
two
hundred
million
dollars
worth
of
goods
and
its
economic
development
has
scarcely
begun
the
black
west
indies
export
nearly
one
hundred
million
worth
of
goods
to
this
must
be
added
the
labor
value
of
negroes
in
south
africa
egypt
the
west
indies
north
central
and
south
america
where
the
result
is
blended
in
the
common
output
of
many
races
the
economic
foundation
of
the
negro
problem
can
easily
be
seen
to
be
a
matter
of
many
hundreds
of
millions
and
ready
to
rise
to
the
billions
tomorrow
such
figures
and
facts
give
some
slight
idea
of
the
economic
meaning
of
the
negro
as
a
worker
and
industrial
factor
tropical
africa
and
its
peoples
are
being
brought
more
irrevocably
every
year
into
the
vortex
of
the
economic
influences
that
sway
the
western
world
what
do
negroes
themselves
think
of
these
their
problems
and
the
attitude
of
the
world
toward
them
first
and
most
significant
they
are
thinking
there
is
as
yet
no
great
single
centralizing
of
thought
or
unification
of
opinion
but
there
are
centers
which
are
growing
larger
and
larger
and
touching
edges
the
most
significant
centers
of
this
new
thinking
are
perhaps
naturally
outside
africa
and
in
america
in
the
united
states
and
in
the
west
indies
this
is
followed
by
south
africa
and
west
africa
and
then
more
vaguely
by
south
america
with
faint
beginnings
in
east
central
africa
nigeria
and
the
sudan
the
movement
when
it
comes
will
not
however
be
merely
a
narrow
racial
propaganda
already
the
more
negroes
sense
the
coming
unities
a
unity
of
the
working
classes
everywhere
a
unity
of
the
colored
races
a
new
unity
of
men
the
proposed
economic
solution
of
the
negro
problem
in
africa
and
america
has
turned
the
thoughts
of
negroes
toward
a
realization
of
the
fact
that
the
modern
white
laborer
of
europe
and
america
has
the
key
to
the
serfdom
of
black
folk
in
his
support
of
militarism
and
colonial
expansion
he
is
beginning
to
say
to
these
workingmen
that
so
long
as
black
laborers
are
slaves
white
laborers
can
not
be
free
already
there
are
signs
in
south
africa
and
the
united
states
of
the
beginning
of
understanding
between
the
two
classes
in
a
conscious
sense
of
unity
among
colored
races
there
is
only
a
growing
interest
there
is
slowly
arising
not
only
a
curiously
strong
brotherhood
of
negro
blood
throughout
the
world
but
the
common
cause
of
the
darker
races
against
the
intolerable
assumptions
and
insults
of
europeans
has
already
found
expression
most
men
in
this
world
are
colored
a
belief
in
humanity
means
a
belief
in
colored
men
the
future
world
will
in
all
reasonable
probability
be
what
colored
men
make
it
in
order
for
this
colored
world
to
come
into
its
heritage
must
the
earth
again
be
drenched
in
the
blood
of
fighting
snarling
human
beasts
or
will
reason
and
good
will
prevail
that
such
may
be
true
the
character
of
the
negro
race
is
the
best
and
greatest
hope
for
in
its
normal
condition
it
is
at
once
the
strongest
and
gentlest
of
the
races

in

perhaps
sir
harry
johnston
in
his
various
works
on
africa
has
come
as
near
covering
the
subject
as
any
one
writer
but
his
valuable
books
have
puzzling
inconsistencies
and
inaccuracies
keane
is
a
helpful
compendium
despite
the
fact
that
whenever
keane
discovers
intelligence
in
an
african
he
immediately
discovers
that
its
possessor
is
no
negro

the
compendiums
by
keltie

white

johnston
up
of
are
the
best
among
the
shorter
treatises
none
of
these
authors
write
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
negro
as
a
man
or
with
anything
but
incidental
acknowledgment
of
the
existence
or
value
of

history
we
may
