the
holy
night
the
holy
night
when
i
was
five
years
old
i
had
such
a
great
sorrow
i
hardly
know
if
i
have
had
a
greater
since
it
was
then
my
grandmother
died
up
to
that
time
she
used
to
sit
every
day
on
the
corner
sofa
in
her
room
and
tell
stories
i
remember
that
grandmother
told
story
after
story
from
morning
till
night
and
that
we
children
sat
beside
her
quite
still
and
listened
it
was
a
glorious
life
no
other
children
had
such
happy
times
as
we
did
it
isn
t
much
that
i
recollect
about
my
grandmother
i
remember
that
she
had
very
beautiful
hair
and
stooped
when
she
walked
and
that
she
always
sat
and
knitted
a
stocking
and
i
even
remember
that
when
she
had
finished
a
story
she
used
to
lay
her
hand
on
my
head
and
say
all
this
is
as
true
as
true
as
that
i
see
you
and
you
see
i
also
remember
that
she
could
sing
songs
but
this
she
did
not
do
every
day
one
of
the
songs
was
about
a
knight
and
a
and
had
this
refrain
it
blows
cold
cold
weather
at
then
i
remember
a
little
prayer
she
taught
me
and
a
verse
of
a
hymn
of
all
the
stories
she
told
me
i
have
but
a
dim
and
imperfect
recollection
only
one
of
them
do
i
remember
so
well
that
i
should
be
able
to
repeat
it
it
is
a
little
story
about
jesus
birth
well
this
is
nearly
all
that
i
can
recall
about
my
grandmother
except
the
thing
which
i
remember
best
and
that
is
the
great
loneliness
when
she
was
gone
i
remember
the
morning
when
the
corner
sofa
stood
empty
and
when
it
was
impossible
to
understand
how
the
days
would
ever
come
to
an
end
that
i
remember
that
i
shall
never
forget
and
i
recollect
that
we
children
were
brought
forward
to
kiss
the
hand
of
the
dead
and
that
we
were
afraid
to
do
it
but
then
some
one
said
to
us
that
it
would
be
the
last
time
we
could
thank
grandmother
for
all
the
pleasure
she
had
given
us
and
i
remember
how
the
stories
and
songs
were
driven
from
the
homestead
shut
up
in
a
long
black
casket
and
how
they
never
came
back
again
i
remember
that
something
was
gone
from
our
lives
it
seemed
as
if
the
door
to
a
whole
beautiful
enchanted
before
we
had
been
free
to
go
in
and
been
closed
and
now
there
was
no
one
who
knew
how
to
open
that
door
and
i
remember
that
little
by
little
we
children
learned
to
play
with
dolls
and
toys
and
to
live
like
other
children
and
then
it
seemed
as
though
we
no
longer
missed
our
grandmother
or
remembered
her
but
even
forty
i
sit
here
and
gather
together
the
legends
about
christ
which
i
heard
out
there
in
the
orient
there
awakes
within
me
the
little
legend
of
jesus
birth
that
my
grandmother
used
to
tell
and
i
feel
impelled
to
tell
it
once
again
and
to
let
it
also
be
included
in
my
collection
it
was
a
christmas
day
and
all
the
folks
had
driven
to
church
except
grandmother
and
i
believe
we
were
all
alone
in
the
house
we
had
not
been
permitted
to
go
along
because
one
of
us
was
too
old
and
the
other
was
too
young
and
we
were
sad
both
of
us
because
we
had
not
been
taken
to
early
mass
to
hear
the
singing
and
to
see
the
christmas
candles
but
as
we
sat
there
in
our
loneliness
grandmother
began
to
tell
a
story
there
was
a
man
said
she
who
went
out
in
the
dark
night
to
borrow
live
coals
to
kindle
a
fire
he
went
from
hut
to
hut
and
knocked
dear
friends
help
me
said
he
my
wife
has
just
given
birth
to
a
child
and
i
must
make
a
fire
to
warm
her
and
the
little
but
it
was
way
in
the
night
and
all
the
people
were
asleep
no
one
replied
the
man
walked
and
walked
at
last
he
saw
the
gleam
of
a
fire
a
long
way
off
then
he
went
in
that
direction
and
saw
that
the
fire
was
burning
in
the
open
a
lot
of
sheep
were
sleeping
around
the
fire
and
an
old
shepherd
sat
and
watched
over
the
flock
when
the
man
who
wanted
to
borrow
fire
came
up
to
the
sheep
he
saw
that
three
big
dogs
lay
asleep
at
the
shepherd
s
feet
all
three
awoke
when
the
man
approached
and
opened
their
great
jaws
as
though
they
wanted
to
bark
but
not
a
sound
was
heard
the
man
noticed
that
the
hair
on
their
backs
stood
up
and
that
their
sharp
white
teeth
glistened
in
the
firelight
they
dashed
toward
him
he
felt
that
one
of
them
bit
at
his
leg
and
one
at
his
hand
and
that
one
clung
to
his
throat
but
their
jaws
and
teeth
wouldn
t
obey
them
and
the
man
didn
t
suffer
the
least
harm
now
the
man
wished
to
go
farther
to
get
what
he
needed
but
the
sheep
lay
back
to
back
and
so
close
to
one
another
that
he
couldn
t
pass
them
then
the
man
stepped
upon
their
backs
and
walked
over
them
and
up
to
the
fire
and
not
one
of
the
animals
awoke
or
thus
far
grandmother
had
been
allowed
to
narrate
without
interruption
but
at
this
point
i
couldn
t
help
breaking
in
why
didn
t
they
do
it
grandma
i
asked
that
you
shall
hear
in
a
moment
said
went
on
with
her
story
when
the
man
had
almost
reached
the
fire
the
shepherd
looked
up
he
was
a
surly
old
man
who
was
unfriendly
and
harsh
toward
human
beings
and
when
he
saw
the
strange
man
coming
he
seized
the
long
spiked
staff
which
he
always
held
in
his
hand
when
he
tended
his
flock
and
threw
it
at
him
the
staff
came
right
toward
the
man
but
before
it
reached
him
it
turned
off
to
one
side
and
whizzed
past
him
far
out
in
the
when
grandmother
had
got
this
far
i
interrupted
her
again
grandma
why
wouldn
t
the
stick
hurt
the
man
grandmother
did
not
bother
about
answering
me
but
continued
her
story
now
the
man
came
up
to
the
shepherd
and
said
to
him
good
man
help
me
and
lend
me
a
little
fire
my
wife
has
just
given
birth
to
a
child
and
i
must
make
a
fire
to
warm
her
and
the
little
the
shepherd
would
rather
have
said
no
but
when
he
pondered
that
the
dogs
couldn
t
hurt
the
man
and
the
sheep
had
not
run
from
him
and
that
the
staff
had
not
wished
to
strike
him
he
was
a
little
afraid
and
dared
not
deny
the
man
that
which
he
asked
take
as
much
as
you
need
he
said
to
the
man
but
then
the
fire
was
nearly
burnt
out
there
were
no
logs
or
branches
left
only
a
big
heap
of
live
coals
and
the
stranger
had
neither
spade
nor
shovel
wherein
he
could
carry
the
coals
when
the
shepherd
saw
this
he
said
again
take
as
much
as
you
need
and
he
was
glad
that
the
man
wouldn
t
be
able
to
take
away
any
coals
but
the
man
stooped
and
picked
coals
from
the
ashes
with
his
bare
hands
and
laid
them
in
his
mantle
and
he
didn
t
burn
his
hands
when
he
touched
them
nor
did
the
coals
scorch
his
mantle
but
he
carried
them
away
as
if
they
had
been
nuts
or
but
here
the
was
interrupted
for
the
third
time
grandma
why
wouldn
t
the
coals
burn
the
man
that
you
shall
hear
said
grandmother
and
went
on
and
when
the
shepherd
who
was
such
a
cruel
and
man
saw
all
this
he
began
to
wonder
to
himself
what
kind
of
a
night
is
this
when
the
dogs
do
not
bite
the
sheep
are
not
scared
the
staff
does
not
kill
or
the
fire
scorch
he
called
the
stranger
back
and
said
to
him
what
kind
of
a
night
is
this
and
how
does
it
happen
that
all
things
show
you
compassion
then
said
the
man
i
can
not
tell
you
if
you
yourself
do
not
see
and
he
wished
to
go
his
way
that
he
might
soon
make
a
fire
and
warm
his
wife
and
child
but
the
shepherd
did
not
wish
to
lose
sight
of
the
man
before
he
had
found
out
what
all
this
might
portend
he
got
up
and
followed
the
man
till
they
came
to
the
place
where
he
lived
then
the
shepherd
saw
that
the
man
didn
t
have
so
much
as
a
hut
to
dwell
in
but
that
his
wife
and
babe
were
lying
in
a
mountain
grotto
where
there
was
nothing
except
the
cold
and
naked
stone
walls
but
the
shepherd
thought
that
perhaps
the
poor
innocent
child
might
freeze
to
death
there
in
the
grotto
and
although
he
was
a
hard
man
he
was
touched
and
thought
he
would
like
to
help
it
and
he
loosened
his
knapsack
from
his
shoulder
took
from
it
a
soft
white
sheepskin
gave
it
to
the
strange
man
and
said
that
he
should
let
the
child
sleep
on
it
but
just
as
soon
as
he
showed
that
he
too
could
be
merciful
his
eyes
were
opened
and
he
saw
what
he
had
not
been
able
to
see
before
and
heard
what
he
could
not
have
heard
before
he
saw
that
all
around
him
stood
a
ring
of
little
angels
and
each
held
a
stringed
instrument
and
all
sang
in
loud
tones
that
the
saviour
was
born
who
should
redeem
the
world
from
its
sins
then
he
understood
how
all
things
were
so
happy
this
night
that
they
didn
t
want
to
do
anything
wrong
and
it
was
not
only
around
the
shepherd
that
there
were
angels
but
he
saw
them
everywhere
they
sat
inside
the
grotto
they
sat
outside
on
the
mountain
and
they
flew
under
the
heavens
they
came
marching
in
great
companies
and
as
they
passed
they
paused
and
cast
a
glance
at
the
child
there
were
such
jubilation
and
such
gladness
and
songs
and
play
and
all
this
he
saw
in
the
dark
night
whereas
before
he
could
not
have
made
out
anything
he
was
so
happy
because
his
eyes
had
been
opened
that
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
thanked
here
grandmother
sighed
and
said
what
that
shepherd
saw
we
might
also
see
for
the
angels
fly
down
from
heaven
every
christmas
eve
if
we
could
only
see
then
grandmother
laid
her
hand
on
my
head
and
said
you
must
remember
this
for
it
is
as
true
as
true
as
that
i
see
you
and
you
see
me
it
is
not
revealed
by
the
light
of
lamps
or
candles
and
it
does
not
depend
upon
sun
and
moon
but
that
which
is
needful
is
that
we
have
such
eyes
as
can
see
god
s
illustration
the
emperor
s
vision
the
emperor
s
vision
it
happened
at
the
time
when
augustus
was
emperor
in
rome
and
herod
was
king
in
jerusalem
it
was
then
that
a
very
great
and
holy
night
sank
down
over
the
earth
it
was
the
darkest
night
that
any
one
had
ever
seen
one
could
have
believed
that
the
whole
earth
had
fallen
into
a
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
water
from
land
and
one
could
not
find
one
s
way
on
the
most
familiar
road
and
it
couldn
t
be
otherwise
for
not
a
ray
of
light
came
from
heaven
all
the
stars
stayed
at
home
in
their
own
houses
and
the
fair
moon
held
her
face
averted
the
silence
and
the
stillness
were
as
profound
as
the
darkness
the
rivers
stood
still
in
their
courses
the
wind
did
not
stir
and
even
the
aspen
leaves
had
ceased
to
quiver
had
any
one
walked
along
the
seashore
he
would
have
found
that
the
waves
no
longer
dashed
upon
the
sands
and
had
one
wandered
in
the
desert
the
sand
would
not
have
crunched
under
one
s
feet
everything
was
as
motionless
as
if
turned
to
stone
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
holy
night
the
grass
was
afraid
to
grow
the
dew
could
not
fall
and
the
flowers
dared
not
exhale
their
perfume
on
this
night
the
wild
beasts
did
not
seek
their
prey
the
serpents
did
not
sting
and
the
dogs
did
not
bark
and
what
was
even
more
glorious
inanimate
things
would
have
been
unwilling
to
disturb
the
night
s
sanctity
by
lending
themselves
to
an
evil
deed
no
false
key
could
have
picked
a
lock
and
no
knife
could
possibly
have
drawn
a
drop
of
blood
in
rome
during
this
very
night
a
small
company
of
people
came
from
the
emperor
s
palace
at
the
palatine
and
took
the
path
across
the
forum
which
led
to
the
capitol
during
the
day
just
ended
the
senators
had
asked
the
emperor
if
he
had
any
objections
to
their
erecting
a
temple
to
him
on
rome
s
sacred
hill
but
augustus
had
not
immediately
given
his
consent
he
did
not
know
if
it
would
be
agreeable
to
the
gods
that
he
should
own
a
temple
next
to
theirs
and
he
had
replied
that
first
he
wished
to
ascertain
their
will
in
the
matter
by
offering
a
nocturnal
sacrifice
to
his
genius
it
was
he
who
accompanied
by
a
few
trusted
friends
was
on
his
way
to
perform
this
sacrifice
augustus
let
them
carry
him
in
his
litter
for
he
was
old
and
it
was
an
effort
for
him
to
climb
the
long
stairs
leading
to
the
capitol
he
himself
held
the
cage
with
the
doves
for
the
sacrifice
no
priests
or
soldiers
or
senators
accompanied
him
only
his
nearest
friends
walked
in
front
of
him
in
order
to
light
the
way
in
the
night
darkness
and
behind
him
followed
the
slaves
who
carried
the
tripod
the
knives
the
charcoal
the
sacred
fire
and
all
the
other
things
needed
for
the
sacrifice
on
the
way
the
emperor
chatted
gaily
with
his
faithful
followers
and
therefore
none
of
them
noticed
the
infinite
silence
and
stillness
of
the
night
only
when
they
had
reached
the
highest
point
of
the
capitol
hill
and
the
vacant
spot
upon
which
they
contemplated
erecting
the
temple
did
it
dawn
upon
them
that
something
unusual
was
taking
place
it
could
not
be
a
night
like
all
others
for
up
on
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
they
saw
the
most
remarkable
being
at
first
they
thought
it
was
an
old
distorted
later
they
imagined
that
an
ancient
stone
figure
from
the
temple
of
jupiter
had
wandered
out
on
the
cliff
finally
it
was
apparent
to
them
that
it
could
be
only
the
old
sibyl
anything
so
aged
so
and
so
in
stature
they
had
never
seen
this
old
woman
was
if
the
emperor
had
not
been
present
they
would
all
have
fled
to
their
homes
it
is
she
they
whispered
to
each
other
who
has
lived
as
many
years
as
there
are
on
her
native
shores
why
has
she
come
out
from
her
cave
just
what
does
she
foretell
for
the
emperor
and
the
who
writes
her
prophecies
on
the
leaves
of
the
trees
and
knows
that
the
wind
will
carry
the
words
of
the
oracle
to
the
person
for
whom
they
are
intended
they
were
so
terrified
that
they
would
have
dropped
on
their
knees
with
their
foreheads
pressed
against
the
earth
had
the
sibyl
stirred
but
she
sat
as
still
as
though
she
were
lifeless
crouching
upon
the
outermost
edge
of
the
cliff
and
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
she
peered
out
into
the
night
she
sat
there
as
if
she
had
gone
up
on
the
hill
that
she
might
see
more
clearly
something
that
was
happening
far
away
could
see
things
on
a
night
like
this
at
that
moment
the
emperor
and
all
his
retinue
marked
how
profound
the
darkness
was
none
of
them
could
see
a
hand
s
breadth
in
front
of
him
and
what
stillness
what
silence
not
even
the
tiber
s
hollow
murmur
could
they
hear
the
air
seemed
to
suffocate
them
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
their
foreheads
and
their
hands
were
numb
and
powerless
they
feared
that
some
dreadful
disaster
was
impending
but
no
one
cared
to
show
that
he
was
afraid
and
everyone
told
the
emperor
that
this
was
a
good
omen
all
nature
held
its
breath
to
greet
a
new
god
they
counseled
augustus
to
hurry
with
the
sacrifice
and
said
that
the
old
sibyl
had
evidently
come
out
of
her
cave
to
greet
his
genius
but
the
truth
was
that
the
old
sibyl
was
so
absorbed
in
a
vision
that
she
did
not
even
know
that
augustus
had
come
up
to
the
capitol
she
was
transported
in
spirit
to
a
land
where
she
imagined
that
she
was
wandering
over
a
great
plain
in
the
darkness
she
stubbed
her
foot
continually
against
something
which
she
believed
to
be
she
stooped
down
and
felt
with
her
hand
no
it
was
not
grass
but
sheep
she
was
walking
between
great
sleeping
flocks
of
sheep
then
she
noticed
the
shepherds
fire
it
burned
in
the
middle
of
the
field
and
she
groped
her
way
to
it
the
shepherds
lay
asleep
by
the
fire
and
beside
them
were
the
long
spiked
staves
with
which
they
defended
their
flocks
from
wild
beasts
but
the
little
animals
with
the
glittering
eyes
and
the
bushy
tails
that
stole
up
to
the
fire
were
they
not
jackals
and
yet
the
shepherds
did
not
fling
their
staves
at
them
the
dogs
continued
to
sleep
the
sheep
did
not
flee
and
the
wild
animals
lay
down
to
rest
beside
the
human
beings
this
the
sibyl
saw
but
she
knew
nothing
of
what
was
being
enacted
on
the
hill
back
of
her
she
did
not
know
that
there
they
were
raising
an
altar
lighting
charcoal
and
strewing
incense
and
that
the
emperor
took
one
of
the
doves
from
the
cage
to
sacrifice
it
but
his
hands
were
so
benumbed
that
he
could
not
hold
the
bird
with
one
stroke
of
the
wing
it
freed
itself
and
disappeared
in
the
night
darkness
when
this
happened
the
courtiers
glanced
suspiciously
at
the
old
sibyl
they
believed
that
it
was
she
who
caused
the
misfortune
could
they
know
that
all
the
while
the
sibyl
thought
herself
standing
beside
the
shepherds
fire
and
that
she
listened
to
a
faint
sound
which
came
trembling
through
the
night
she
heard
it
long
before
she
marked
that
it
did
not
come
from
the
earth
but
from
the
sky
at
last
she
raised
her
head
then
she
saw
light
shimmering
forms
glide
forward
in
the
darkness
they
were
little
flocks
of
angels
who
singing
joyously
and
apparently
searching
flew
back
and
forth
above
the
wide
plain
while
the
sibyl
was
listening
to
the
the
emperor
was
making
preparations
for
a
new
sacrifice
he
washed
his
hands
cleansed
the
altar
and
took
up
the
other
dove
and
although
he
exerted
his
full
strength
to
hold
it
fast
the
dove
s
slippery
body
slid
from
his
hand
and
the
bird
swung
itself
up
into
the
impenetrable
night
the
emperor
was
appalled
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
prayed
to
his
genius
he
implored
him
for
strength
to
avert
the
disasters
which
this
night
seemed
to
foreshadow
nor
did
the
sibyl
hear
any
of
this
either
she
was
listening
with
her
whole
soul
to
the
which
grew
louder
and
louder
at
last
it
became
so
powerful
that
it
wakened
the
shepherds
they
raised
themselves
on
their
elbows
and
saw
shining
hosts
of
angels
move
in
the
darkness
in
long
swaying
lines
like
migratory
birds
some
held
lutes
and
cymbals
in
their
hands
others
held
zithers
and
harps
and
their
song
rang
out
as
merry
as
and
as
as
the
lark
s
trill
when
the
shepherds
heard
this
they
rose
up
to
go
to
the
mountain
city
where
they
lived
to
tell
of
the
miracle
they
groped
their
way
forward
on
a
narrow
winding
path
and
the
sibyl
followed
them
suddenly
it
grew
light
up
there
on
the
mountain
a
big
clear
star
kindled
right
over
it
and
the
city
on
the
mountain
summit
glittered
like
silver
in
the
starlight
all
the
fluttering
angel
throngs
hastened
thither
shouting
for
joy
and
the
shepherds
hurried
so
that
they
almost
ran
when
they
reached
the
city
they
found
that
the
angels
had
assembled
over
a
low
stable
near
the
city
gate
it
was
a
wretched
structure
with
a
roof
of
straw
and
the
naked
cliff
for
a
back
wall
over
it
hung
the
star
and
hither
flocked
more
and
more
angels
some
seated
themselves
on
the
straw
roof
or
alighted
upon
the
steep
back
of
the
house
others
again
held
themselves
in
the
air
on
outspread
wings
and
hovered
over
it
high
high
up
the
air
was
illuminated
by
the
shining
wings
the
instant
the
star
kindled
over
the
mountain
city
all
nature
awoke
and
the
men
who
stood
upon
capitol
hill
could
not
help
seeing
it
they
felt
fresh
but
caressing
winds
which
traveled
through
space
delicious
perfumes
streamed
up
about
them
trees
swayed
the
tiber
began
to
murmur
the
stars
twinkled
and
suddenly
the
moon
stood
out
in
the
sky
and
lit
up
the
world
and
out
of
the
clouds
the
two
doves
came
circling
down
and
lighted
upon
the
emperor
s
shoulders
when
this
miracle
happened
augustus
rose
proud
and
happy
but
his
friends
and
his
slaves
fell
on
their
knees
hail
cæsar
they
cried
thy
genius
hath
answered
thee
thou
art
the
god
who
shall
be
worshiped
on
capitol
hill
and
this
cry
of
homage
which
the
men
in
their
transport
gave
as
a
tribute
to
the
emperor
was
so
loud
that
the
old
sibyl
heard
it
it
waked
her
from
her
visions
she
rose
from
her
place
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
came
down
among
the
people
it
was
as
if
a
dark
cloud
had
arisen
from
the
abyss
and
rushed
down
the
mountain
height
she
was
terrifying
in
her
extreme
age
coarse
hair
hung
in
matted
tangles
around
her
head
her
joints
were
enlarged
and
the
dark
skin
hard
as
the
bark
of
a
tree
covered
her
body
with
furrow
upon
furrow
potent
and
she
advanced
toward
the
emperor
with
one
hand
she
clutched
his
wrist
with
the
other
she
pointed
toward
the
distant
east
look
she
commanded
and
the
emperor
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
the
vaulted
heavens
opened
before
his
eyes
and
his
glance
traveled
to
the
distant
orient
he
saw
a
lowly
stable
behind
a
steep
rock
wall
and
in
the
open
doorway
a
few
shepherds
kneeling
within
the
stable
he
saw
a
young
mother
on
her
knees
before
a
little
child
who
lay
upon
a
bundle
of
straw
on
the
floor
and
the
sibyl
s
big
knotty
fingers
pointed
toward
the
poor
babe
hail
cæsar
cried
the
sibyl
in
a
burst
of
scornful
laughter
there
is
the
god
who
shall
be
worshiped
on
capitol
hill
then
augustus
shrank
back
from
her
as
from
a
maniac
but
upon
the
sibyl
fell
the
mighty
spirit
of
prophecy
her
dim
eyes
began
to
burn
her
hands
were
stretched
toward
heaven
her
voice
was
so
changed
that
it
seemed
not
to
be
her
own
but
rang
out
with
such
resonance
and
power
that
it
could
have
been
heard
over
the
whole
world
and
she
uttered
words
which
she
appeared
to
be
reading
among
the
stars
upon
capitol
hill
shall
the
redeemer
of
the
world
be
worshiped
not
frail
when
she
had
said
this
she
strode
past
the
men
walked
slowly
down
the
mountain
and
disappeared
but
on
the
following
day
augustus
strictly
forbade
the
people
to
raise
any
temple
to
him
on
capitol
hill
in
place
of
it
he
built
a
sanctuary
to
the
and
called
it
heaven
s
illustration
the
wise
men
s
well
the
wise
men
s
well
in
old
judea
the
drought
crept
gaunt
and
between
shrunken
thistles
and
yellowed
grass
it
was
summertime
the
sun
beat
down
upon
the
backs
of
unshaded
hills
and
the
slightest
breath
of
wind
tore
up
thick
clouds
of
lime
dust
from
the
ground
the
herds
stood
huddled
together
in
the
valleys
by
the
streams
the
drought
walked
about
and
viewed
the
water
supplies
he
wandered
over
to
solomon
s
pools
and
sighed
as
he
saw
that
they
still
held
a
small
quantity
of
water
from
their
mountain
sources
then
he
journeyed
down
to
the
famous
david
s
well
near
bethlehem
and
found
water
even
there
finally
he
tramped
with
shuffling
gait
toward
the
great
highway
which
leads
from
bethlehem
to
jerusalem
when
he
had
arrived
about
he
saw
the
wise
men
s
well
where
it
stands
close
by
the
roadside
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
it
was
almost
dry
he
seated
himself
on
the
curb
which
consists
of
a
single
stone
hollowed
out
and
looked
into
the
well
the
shining
which
usually
was
seen
very
near
the
opening
had
sunk
deep
down
and
the
dirt
and
slime
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
made
it
muddy
and
impure
when
the
well
beheld
the
drought
s
bronzed
visage
reflected
in
her
clouded
mirror
she
shook
with
anguish
i
wonder
when
you
will
be
exhausted
said
the
drought
surely
you
do
not
expect
to
find
any
fresh
water
source
down
there
in
the
deep
to
come
and
give
you
new
life
and
as
for
be
praised
there
can
be
no
question
of
that
for
the
next
two
or
three
you
may
rest
content
sighed
the
well
for
nothing
can
help
me
now
it
would
take
no
less
than
a
from
paradise
to
save
me
then
i
will
not
forsake
you
until
every
drop
has
been
drained
said
the
drought
he
saw
that
the
old
well
was
nearing
its
end
and
now
he
wanted
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
it
die
out
drop
by
drop
he
seated
himself
comfortably
on
the
edge
of
the
curb
and
rejoiced
as
he
heard
how
the
well
sighed
down
there
in
the
deep
he
also
took
a
keen
delight
in
watching
the
thirsty
wayfarers
come
up
to
the
let
down
the
bucket
and
draw
it
up
again
with
only
a
few
drops
of
muddy
water
thus
the
whole
day
passed
and
when
darkness
descended
the
drought
looked
again
into
the
well
a
little
water
still
shimmered
down
there
i
ll
stay
here
all
night
cried
he
so
do
not
hurry
yourself
when
it
grows
so
light
that
i
can
look
into
you
once
more
i
am
certain
that
all
will
be
over
with
the
drought
curled
himself
up
on
the
edge
of
the
while
the
hot
night
which
was
even
more
cruel
and
more
full
of
torment
than
the
day
had
been
descended
over
judea
dogs
and
jackals
howled
incessantly
and
thirsty
cows
and
asses
answered
them
from
their
stuffy
stalls
when
the
breeze
stirred
a
little
now
and
then
it
brought
with
it
no
relief
but
was
as
hot
and
suffocating
as
a
great
sleeping
monster
s
panting
breath
the
stars
shone
with
the
most
resplendent
brilliancy
and
a
little
silvery
new
moon
cast
a
pretty
light
over
the
gray
hills
and
in
this
light
the
drought
saw
a
great
caravan
come
marching
toward
the
hill
where
the
wise
men
s
well
was
situated
the
drought
sat
and
gazed
at
the
long
procession
and
rejoiced
again
at
the
thought
of
all
the
thirst
which
was
coming
to
the
well
and
would
not
find
one
drop
of
water
with
which
to
slake
itself
there
were
so
many
animals
and
drivers
they
could
easily
have
emptied
the
well
even
if
it
had
been
quite
full
suddenly
he
began
to
think
there
was
something
unusual
something
about
this
caravan
which
came
marching
forward
in
the
night
first
all
the
camels
came
within
sight
on
a
hill
which
loomed
up
high
and
distinct
against
the
horizon
it
was
as
though
they
had
stepped
straight
down
from
heaven
they
also
appeared
to
be
larger
than
ordinary
camels
and
too
enormous
burdens
which
weighted
them
still
he
could
not
understand
anything
but
that
they
were
absolutely
real
for
to
him
they
were
just
as
plain
as
plain
could
be
he
could
even
see
that
the
three
foremost
animals
were
dromedaries
with
gray
shiny
skins
and
that
they
were
richly
bridled
and
saddled
with
fringed
coverings
and
were
ridden
by
handsome
knights
the
whole
procession
stopped
at
the
well
with
three
sharp
jerks
the
dromedaries
lay
down
on
the
ground
and
their
riders
dismounted
the
remained
standing
and
as
they
assembled
they
seemed
to
form
a
long
line
of
necks
and
humps
and
peculiarly
packs
immediately
the
riders
came
up
to
the
drought
and
greeted
him
by
laying
their
hands
upon
their
foreheads
and
breasts
he
saw
that
they
wore
dazzling
white
robes
and
huge
turbans
on
the
front
of
each
of
which
there
was
a
clear
glittering
star
which
shone
as
if
it
had
been
taken
direct
from
the
skies
we
come
from
a
land
said
one
of
the
strangers
and
we
bid
thee
tell
us
if
this
is
in
truth
the
wise
men
s
well
it
is
called
so
said
the
drought
but
by
there
will
be
no
well
here
it
shall
die
i
can
understand
this
as
i
see
thee
here
said
the
man
but
is
not
this
one
of
the
sacred
wells
which
never
run
dry
or
whence
hath
it
derived
its
name
i
know
it
is
sacred
said
the
drought
but
what
good
will
that
do
the
three
wise
men
are
in
the
three
travelers
exchanged
glances
dost
thou
really
know
the
history
of
this
ancient
well
asked
they
i
know
the
history
of
all
wells
and
fountains
and
brooks
and
rivers
said
the
drought
with
pride
then
grant
us
a
pleasure
and
tell
us
the
story
begged
the
strangers
and
they
seated
themselves
around
the
old
enemy
to
everything
growing
and
listened
the
drought
shook
himself
and
crawled
up
on
the
like
a
upon
his
improvised
throne
and
began
his
tale
in
gebas
in
media
a
city
which
lies
near
the
border
of
the
therefore
it
has
often
been
a
free
and
city
to
me
lived
many
many
years
ago
three
men
who
were
famed
for
their
wisdom
they
were
also
very
poor
which
was
a
most
uncommon
state
of
affairs
for
in
gebas
knowledge
was
held
in
high
esteem
and
was
well
recompensed
with
these
men
however
it
could
hardly
have
been
otherwise
for
one
of
them
was
very
old
one
was
afflicted
with
leprosy
and
the
third
was
a
black
negro
people
regarded
the
first
as
much
too
old
to
teach
them
anything
the
second
they
avoided
for
fear
of
contagion
and
the
third
they
would
not
listen
to
because
they
thought
they
knew
that
no
wisdom
had
ever
come
from
ethiopia
meanwhile
the
three
wise
ones
became
united
through
their
common
misery
they
begged
during
the
day
at
the
same
temple
gate
and
at
night
they
slept
on
the
same
roof
in
this
way
they
at
least
had
an
opportunity
to
while
away
the
hours
by
meditating
upon
all
the
wonderful
things
which
they
observed
in
nature
and
in
the
human
race
one
night
as
they
slept
side
by
side
on
a
roof
which
was
overgrown
with
stupefying
red
poppies
the
eldest
among
them
awoke
and
hardly
had
he
cast
a
glance
around
him
before
he
wakened
the
other
two
praised
be
our
poverty
which
compels
us
to
sleep
in
the
open
he
said
to
them
awake
and
raise
your
eyes
to
heaven
well
said
the
drought
in
a
somewhat
milder
tone
this
was
a
night
which
no
one
who
witnessed
it
can
ever
forget
the
skies
were
so
bright
that
the
heavens
which
usually
resemble
an
arched
vault
looked
deep
and
transparent
and
full
of
waves
like
a
sea
the
light
surged
backwards
and
forwards
and
the
stars
swam
in
their
varying
depths
some
in
among
the
others
upon
the
surface
but
farthest
away
and
highest
up
the
three
men
saw
a
faint
shadow
appear
this
shadow
traveled
through
space
like
a
ball
and
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
as
the
ball
approached
it
began
to
brighten
but
it
brightened
as
roses
god
let
them
all
wither
they
burst
from
their
buds
it
grew
bigger
and
bigger
the
dark
cover
about
it
turned
back
by
degrees
and
light
broke
forth
on
its
sides
into
four
distinct
leaves
finally
when
it
had
descended
to
the
nearest
of
the
stars
it
came
to
a
standstill
then
the
dark
lobes
curled
themselves
back
and
unfolded
leaf
upon
leaf
of
beautiful
shimmering
light
until
it
was
perfect
and
shone
like
a
star
among
stars
when
the
poor
men
beheld
this
their
wisdom
told
them
that
at
this
moment
a
mighty
king
was
born
on
earth
one
whose
majesty
and
power
should
rise
higher
than
that
of
cyrus
or
of
alexander
and
they
said
to
one
another
let
us
go
to
the
father
and
mother
of
the
babe
and
tell
them
what
we
have
seen
mayhap
they
will
reward
us
with
a
purse
of
coin
or
a
bracelet
of
they
grasped
their
long
traveling
staves
and
went
forth
they
wandered
through
the
city
and
out
from
the
city
gate
but
there
they
felt
doubtful
for
a
moment
as
they
saw
before
them
the
great
stretch
of
dry
smooth
desert
which
human
beings
dread
then
they
saw
the
new
star
cast
a
narrow
stream
of
light
across
the
desert
sand
and
they
wandered
confidently
forward
with
the
star
as
their
guide
all
night
long
they
tramped
over
the
wide
and
throughout
the
entire
journey
they
talked
about
the
young
king
whom
they
should
find
reposing
in
a
cradle
of
gold
playing
with
precious
stones
they
whiled
away
the
hours
by
talking
over
how
they
should
approach
his
father
the
king
and
his
mother
the
queen
and
tell
them
that
the
heavens
augured
for
their
son
power
and
beauty
and
joy
greater
than
solomon
s
they
prided
themselves
upon
the
fact
that
god
had
called
to
see
the
star
they
said
to
themselves
that
the
parents
of
the
babe
would
not
reward
them
with
less
than
twenty
purses
of
gold
perhaps
they
would
give
them
so
much
gold
that
they
no
longer
need
suffer
the
pangs
of
poverty
i
lay
in
wait
on
the
desert
like
a
lion
said
the
drought
and
intended
to
throw
myself
upon
these
wanderers
with
all
the
agonies
of
thirst
but
they
eluded
me
all
night
the
star
had
led
them
and
on
the
morrow
when
the
heavens
brightened
and
all
the
other
stars
grew
pale
it
remained
steady
and
illumined
the
desert
and
then
guided
them
to
an
oasis
where
they
found
a
spring
and
a
ripe
tree
there
they
rested
all
that
day
and
toward
night
as
they
saw
the
star
s
rays
border
the
sands
they
went
on
from
the
human
way
of
looking
at
things
continued
the
drought
it
was
a
delightful
journey
the
star
led
them
in
such
a
way
that
they
did
not
have
to
suffer
either
hunger
or
thirst
it
led
them
past
the
sharp
thistles
it
avoided
the
thick
loose
flying
sand
they
escaped
the
burning
sunshine
and
the
hot
desert
storms
the
three
wise
men
said
repeatedly
to
one
another
god
is
protecting
us
and
blessing
our
journey
we
are
his
then
by
degrees
they
fell
into
my
power
said
the
drought
these
hearts
became
transformed
into
as
dry
a
desert
as
the
one
which
they
traveled
through
they
were
filled
with
impotent
pride
and
destructive
greed
we
are
god
s
messengers
repeated
the
three
wise
ones
the
father
of
the
king
will
not
reward
us
too
well
even
if
he
gives
us
a
caravan
laden
with
by
and
by
the
star
led
them
over
the
river
jordan
and
up
among
the
hills
of
judea
one
night
it
stood
still
over
the
little
city
of
bethlehem
which
lay
upon
a
and
shone
among
the
olive
trees
but
the
three
wise
ones
looked
around
for
castles
and
fortified
towers
and
walls
and
all
the
other
things
that
belong
to
a
royal
city
but
of
such
they
saw
nothing
and
what
was
still
worse
the
star
s
light
did
not
even
lead
them
into
the
city
but
remained
over
a
grotto
near
the
wayside
there
the
soft
light
stole
in
through
the
opening
and
revealed
to
the
three
wanderers
a
little
child
who
was
being
lulled
to
sleep
in
its
mother
s
arms
although
the
three
men
saw
how
the
star
s
light
encircled
the
child
s
head
like
a
crown
they
remained
standing
outside
the
grotto
they
did
not
enter
to
prophesy
honors
and
kingdoms
for
this
little
one
they
turned
away
without
betraying
their
presence
they
fled
from
the
child
and
wandered
down
the
hill
again
have
we
come
in
search
of
beggars
as
poor
as
ourselves
said
they
has
god
brought
us
hither
that
we
might
mock
him
and
predict
honors
for
a
shepherd
s
son
this
child
will
never
attain
any
higher
distinction
than
to
tend
sheep
here
in
the
the
drought
chuckled
to
himself
and
nodded
to
his
hearers
as
much
as
to
say
am
i
not
right
there
are
things
which
are
drier
than
the
desert
sands
but
there
is
nothing
more
barren
than
the
human
the
three
wise
ones
had
not
wandered
very
far
before
they
thought
they
had
gone
astray
and
had
not
followed
the
star
rightly
continued
the
drought
they
turned
their
gaze
upward
to
find
again
the
star
and
the
right
road
but
then
the
star
which
they
had
followed
all
the
way
from
the
orient
had
vanished
from
the
the
three
strangers
made
a
quick
movement
and
their
faces
expressed
deep
suffering
that
which
now
happened
continued
the
drought
is
in
accord
with
the
usual
manner
of
mankind
in
judging
of
what
is
perhaps
a
blessing
to
be
sure
when
the
three
wise
men
no
longer
saw
the
star
they
understood
at
once
that
they
had
sinned
against
god
and
it
happened
with
them
continued
the
drought
furiously
just
as
it
happens
with
the
ground
in
the
autumn
when
the
heavy
rains
begin
to
fall
they
shook
with
terror
as
one
shakes
when
it
thunders
and
lightens
their
whole
being
softened
and
humility
like
green
grass
sprang
up
in
their
souls
for
three
nights
and
days
they
wandered
about
the
country
in
quest
of
the
child
whom
they
would
worship
but
the
star
did
not
appear
to
them
they
grew
more
and
more
bewildered
and
suffered
the
most
overwhelming
anguish
and
despair
on
the
third
day
they
came
to
this
well
to
drink
then
god
had
pardoned
their
sin
and
as
they
bent
over
the
water
they
saw
in
its
depths
the
reflection
of
the
star
which
had
brought
them
from
the
orient
instantly
they
saw
it
also
in
the
heavens
and
it
led
them
again
to
the
grotto
in
bethlehem
where
they
fell
upon
their
knees
before
the
child
and
said
we
bring
thee
golden
vessels
filled
with
incense
and
costly
spices
thou
shalt
be
the
greatest
king
that
ever
lived
upon
earth
from
its
creation
even
unto
its
then
the
child
laid
his
hand
upon
their
lowered
heads
and
when
they
rose
lo
the
child
had
given
them
gifts
greater
than
a
king
could
have
granted
for
the
old
beggar
had
grown
young
the
leper
was
made
whole
and
the
negro
was
transformed
into
a
beautiful
white
man
and
it
is
said
of
them
that
they
were
glorious
and
that
they
departed
and
became
in
his
own
the
drought
paused
in
his
story
and
the
three
strangers
praised
it
thou
hast
spoken
well
said
they
but
it
surprises
me
said
one
of
them
that
the
three
wise
men
do
nothing
for
the
well
which
showed
them
the
star
shall
they
entirely
forget
such
a
great
blessing
should
not
this
well
remain
perpetually
said
the
second
stranger
to
remind
mankind
that
happiness
which
is
lost
on
the
heights
of
pride
and
vainglory
will
let
itself
be
found
again
in
the
depths
of
humility
are
the
departed
worse
than
the
living
asked
the
third
does
gratitude
die
with
those
who
live
in
paradise
but
as
he
heard
this
the
drought
sprang
up
with
a
wild
cry
he
had
recognized
the
strangers
he
understood
who
the
strangers
were
and
fled
from
them
like
a
madman
that
he
might
not
witness
how
the
three
wise
men
called
their
servants
and
led
their
camels
laden
with
to
the
well
and
filled
the
poor
dying
well
with
water
which
they
had
brought
with
them
from
paradise

bethlehem
s

bethlehem
s
children
just
outside
the
bethlehem
gate
stood
a
roman
soldier
on
guard
he
was
arrayed
in
full
armor
with
helmet
at
his
side
he
wore
a
short
sword
and
held
in
his
hand
a
long
spear
he
stood
there
all
day
almost
motionless
so
that
one
could
readily
have
believed
him
to
be
a
man
made
of
iron
the
city
people
went
in
and
out
of
the
gate
and
beggars
lolled
in
the
shade
under
the
archway
fruit
venders
and
wine
dealers
set
their
baskets
and
jugs
down
on
the
ground
beside
the
soldier
but
he
scarcely
took
the
trouble
to
turn
his
head
to
look
at
them
it
seemed
as
though
he
wanted
to
say
this
is
nothing
to
see
what
do
i
care
about
you
who
labor
and
barter
and
come
driving
with
oil

and
wine
sacks
let
me
see
an
army
prepare
to
meet
the
enemy
let
me
see
the
excitement
and
the
hot
struggle
when
horsemen
charge
down
upon
a
troop
of
let
me
see
the
brave
men
who
rush
forward
to
scale
the
walls
of
a
beleaguered
city
nothing
is
pleasing
to
my
sight
but
war
i
long
to
see
the
roman
eagles
glisten
in
the
air
i
long
for
the
trumpets
blast
for
shining
weapons
for
the
splash
of
red
blood
just
beyond
the
city
gate
lay
a
fine
meadow
overgrown
with
lilies
day
by
day
the
soldier
stood
with
his
eyes
turned
toward
this
meadow
but
never
for
a
moment
did
he
think
of
admiring
the
extraordinary
beauty
of
the
flowers
sometimes
he
noticed
that
the
stopped
to
admire
the
lilies
and
it
amazed
him
to
think
that
people
would
delay
their
travels
to
look
at
anything
so
trivial
these
people
do
not
know
what
is
beautiful
thought
he
and
as
he
thought
thus
he
saw
no
more
the
green
fields
and
olive
groves
round
about
bethlehem
but
dreamed
himself
away
in
a
desert
in
sunny
libya
he
saw
a
legion
of
soldiers
march
forward
in
a
long
straight
line
over
the
yellow
trackless
sand
there
was
no
protection
against
the
sun
s
piercing
rays
no
cooling
stream
no
apparent
boundaries
to
the
desert
and
no
goal
in
sight
no
end
to
their
wanderings
he
saw
soldiers
exhausted
by
hunger
and
thirst
march
forward
with
faltering
step
he
saw
one
after
another
drop
to
the
ground
overcome
by
the
scorching
heat
nevertheless
they
marched
onward
without
a
murmur
without
a
thought
of
deserting
their
leader
and
turning
back
now
is
something
beautiful
thought
the
soldier
something
that
is
worth
the
glance
of
a
valiant
man
since
the
soldier
stood
on
guard
at
the
same
post
day
after
day
he
had
the
best
opportunity
to
watch
the
pretty
children
who
played
about
him
but
it
was
with
the
children
as
with
the
flowers
he
didn
t
understand
that
it
could
be
worth
his
while
to
notice
them
what
is
this
to
rejoice
over
thought
he
when
he
saw
people
smile
as
they
watched
the
children
s
games
it
is
strange
that
any
one
can
find
pleasure
in
a
mere
nothing
one
day
when
the
soldier
was
standing
at
his
accustomed
post
he
saw
a
little
boy
about
three
years
old
come
out
on
the
meadow
to
play
he
was
a
poor
lad
who
was
dressed
in
a
scanty
sheepskin
and
who
played
quite
by
himself
the
soldier
stood
and
regarded
the
newcomer
almost
without
being
aware
of
it
himself
the
first
thing
that
attracted
him
was
that
the
little
one
ran
so
lightly
over
the
field
that
he
seemed
scarcely
to
touch
the
tips
of
the
later
as
he
followed
the
child
s
play
he
was
even
more
astonished
by
my
sword
he
exclaimed
this
child
does
not
play
like
the
others
what
can
it
be
that
occupies
him
as
the
child
played
only
a
few
paces
away
he
could
see
well
enough
what
the
little
one
was
doing
he
saw
how
he
reached
out
his
hand
to
capture
a
bee
that
sat
upon
the
edge
of
a
flower
and
was
so
heavily
laden
with
pollen
that
it
could
hardly
lift
its
wings
for
flight
he
saw
to
his
great
surprise
that
the
bee
let
itself
be
taken
without
trying
to
escape
and
without
using
its
sting
when
the
little
one
held
the
bee
secure
between
his
fingers
he
ran
over
to
a
crack
in
the
city
wall
where
a
swarm
of
bees
had
their
home
and
set
the
bee
down
as
soon
as
he
had
helped
one
bee
in
this
way
he
hastened
back
to
help
another
all
day
long
the
soldier
saw
him
catch
bees
and
carry
them
to
their
home
that
boy
is
certainly
more
foolish
than
any
i
ve
seen
hitherto
thought
the
soldier
what
put
it
into
his
head
to
try
and
help
these
bees
who
can
take
such
good
care
of
themselves
without
him
and
who
can
sting
him
at
that
what
kind
of
a
man
will
he
become
if
he
lives
i
wonder
the
little
one
came
back
day
after
day
and
played
in
the
meadow
and
the
soldier
couldn
t
help
marveling
at
him
and
his
games
it
is
very
strange
thought
he
here
i
have
stood
on
guard
for
fully
three
years
and
thus
far
i
have
seen
nothing
that
could
interest
me
except
this
but
the
soldier
was
in
nowise
pleased
with
the
child
quite
the
reverse
for
this
child
reminded
him
of
a
dreadful
prediction
made
by
an
old
hebrew
seer
who
had
prophesied
that
a
time
of
peace
should
come
to
this
world
some
day
during
a
period
of
a
thousand
years
no
blood
would
be
shed
no
wars
waged
but
human
beings
would
love
one
another
like
brethren
when
the
soldier
thought
that
anything
so
dreadful
might
really
come
to
pass
a
shudder
passed
through
his
body
and
he
gripped
his
spear
hard
as
if
he
sought
support
and
now
the
more
the
soldier
saw
of
the
little
one
and
his
play
the
more
he
thought
of
the
reign
of
peace
he
did
not
fear
that
it
had
come
already
but
he
did
not
like
to
be
reminded
of
anything
so
hateful
one
day
when
the
little
one
was
playing
among
the
flowers
on
the
pretty
meadow
a
very
heavy
shower
came
bursting
through
the
clouds
when
he
noticed
how
big
and
heavy
the
drops
were
that
beat
down
upon
the
sensitive
lilies
he
seemed
anxious
for
his
pretty
friends
he
hurried
away
to
the
biggest
and
loveliest
among
them
and
bent
towards
the
ground
the
stiff
stalk
which
held
up
the
lily
so
that
the
raindrops
caught
the
chalices
on
their
under
side
as
soon
as
he
had
treated
one
flower
like
this
he
ran
to
another
and
bent
its
stem
in
the
same
way
so
that
the
were
turned
toward
the
ground
and
then
to
a
third
and
a
fourth
until
all
the
flowers
in
the
meadow
were
protected
against
the
rainfall
the
soldier
smiled
to
himself
when
he
saw
the
boy
s
work
i
m
afraid
the
lilies
won
t
thank
him
for
this
said
he
naturally
every
stalk
is
broken
it
will
never
do
to
bend
such
stiff
growths
in
that
way
but
when
the
shower
was
over
the
soldier
saw
the
little
lad
hurry
over
to
the
lilies
and
raise
them
up
to
his
utter
astonishment
the
boy
straightened
the
stiff
stalks
without
the
least
difficulty
it
was
apparent
that
not
one
of
them
was
either
broken
or
bruised
he
ran
from
flower
to
flower
and
soon
all
the
rescued
lilies
shone
in
their
full
splendor
in
the
meadow
when
the
soldier
saw
this
he
was
seized
with
a
singular
rage
what
a
queer
child
thought
he
it
is
incredible
that
he
can
undertake
anything
so
idiotic
what
kind
of
a
man
will
he
make
who
can
not
even
bear
to
see
a
lily
destroyed
how
would
it
turn
out
if
such
a
one
had
to
go
to
war
what
would
he
do
if
they
ordered
him
to
burn
a
house
filled
with
women
and
children
or
to
sink
a
ship
with
all
souls
on
board
again
he
thought
of
the
old
prophecy
and
he
began
to
fear
that
the
time
had
actually
come
for
its
fulfilment
since
a
child
like
this
is
here
thought
he
perhaps
this
awful
time
is
very
close
at
hand
already
peace
prevails
over
the
whole
earth
and
surely
the
day
of
war
will
nevermore
dawn
from
this
time
forth
all
peoples
will
be
of
the
same
mind
as
this
child
they
will
be
afraid
to
injure
one
another
yea
they
will
not
have
the
heart
even
to
crush
a
bee
or
a
flower
no
great
deeds
will
be
done
no
glorious
battles
won
and
no
brilliant
triumvirate
will
march
up
to
the
capitol
nothing
more
will
happen
that
a
brave
man
could
long
and
the
all
the
while
hoped
he
would
soon
live
through
new
wars
and
longed
through
daring
feats
to
raise
himself
to
power
and
so
exasperated
with
the
little
that
he
raised
his
spear
threateningly
the
next
time
the
child
ran
past
another
day
it
was
neither
the
bees
nor
the
lilies
the
little
one
sought
to
protect
but
he
undertook
something
which
struck
the
soldier
as
being
much
more
needless
and
thankless
it
was
a
fearfully
hot
day
and
the
sunrays
fell
upon
the
soldier
s
helmet
and
armor
and
heated
them
until
he
felt
as
if
he
wore
a
suit
of
fire
to
the
it
looked
as
if
he
must
suffer
tortures
from
the
heat
his
bloodshot
eyes
were
ready
to
burst
from
their
sockets
and
his
lips
were
dry
and
shriveled
but
as
he
was
inured
to
the
burning
heat
of
african
deserts
he
thought
this
a
mere
trifle
and
it
didn
t
occur
to
him
to
move
from
his
accustomed
place
on
the
contrary
he
took
pleasure
in
showing
the
that
he
was
so
strong
and
hardy
and
did
not
need
to
seek
shelter
from
the
sun
while
he
stood
thus
and
let
himself
be
nearly
broiled
alive
the
little
boy
who
was
wont
to
play
in
the
meadow
came
suddenly
up
to
him
he
knew
very
well
that
the
soldier
was
not
one
of
his
friends
and
so
he
was
always
careful
not
to
come
within
reach
of
his
spear
but
now
he
ran
up
to
him
and
regarded
him
long
and
carefully
then
he
hurried
as
fast
as
he
could
towards
the
road
when
he
came
back
he
held
both
hands
like
a
bowl
and
carried
in
this
way
a
few
drops
of
water
mayhap
this
infant
has
taken
it
upon
himself
to
run
and
fetch
water
for
me
thought
the
soldier
he
is
certainly
wanting
in
common
sense
should
not
a
roman
soldier
be
able
to
stand
a
little
heat
what
need
for
that
youngster
to
run
around
and
help
those
who
require
no
help
i
don
t
want
his
compassion
i
wish
he
and
all
like
him
were
out
of
the
world
the
little
one
came
walking
very
slowly
he
held
his
fingers
close
together
so
that
nothing
should
be
spilled
or
wasted
all
the
while
as
he
was
nearing
the
soldier
he
kept
his
eyes
anxiously
fixed
upon
the
little
water
which
he
brought
with
him
and
did
not
see
that
the
man
stood
there
frowning
with
a
forbidding
look
in
his
eye
then
the
child
came
up
to
the
soldier
and
offered
him
the
water
on
the
way
his
heavy
blond
curls
had
tumbled
down
over
his
forehead
and
eyes
he
shook
his
head
several
times
to
get
the
hair
out
of
his
eyes
so
that
he
could
look
up
when
he
succeeded
at
last
and
became
conscious
of
the
hard
expression
on
the
soldier
s
face
he
was
not
frightened
but
stood
still
and
begged
him
with
a
bewitching
smile
to
taste
of
the
water
which
he
had
brought
with
him
but
the
soldier
felt
no
desire
to
accept
a
kindness
from
the
child
whom
he
regarded
as
his
enemy
he
did
not
look
down
into
his
pretty
face
but
stood
rigid
and
immovable
and
showed
no
sign
that
he
understood
what
the
child
wished
to
do
for
him
nor
could
the
child
understand
that
the
man
wished
to
repel
him
he
smiled
all
the
while
just
as
confidently
raised
himself
on
the
tips
of
his
toes
and
stretched
his
hands
as
high
as
he
could
that
the
big
soldier
might
more
easily
get
at
the
water
the
soldier
felt
so
insulted
because
a
mere
child
wished
to
help
him
that
he
gripped
his
spear
to
drive
the
little
one
away
but
just
at
that
moment
the
extreme
heat
and
sunshine
beat
down
upon
the
soldier
with
such
intensity
that
he
saw
red
flames
dance
before
his
eyes
and
felt
his
brains
melt
within
his
head
he
feared
the
sun
would
kill
him
if
he
could
not
find
instant
relief
beside
himself
with
terror
at
the
danger
hovering
over
him
the
soldier
threw
his
spear
on
the
ground
seized
the
child
with
both
hands
lifted
him
up
and
absorbed
as
much
as
he
could
of
the
water
which
the
little
one
held
in
his
hands
only
a
few
drops
touched
his
tongue
but
more
was
not
needed
as
soon
as
he
had
tasted
of
the
water
a
delicious
coolness
surged
through
his
body
and
he
felt
no
more
that
the
helmet
and
armor
burnt
and
oppressed
him
the
sunrays
had
lost
their
deadly
power
his
dry
lips
became
soft
and
moist
again
and
red
flames
no
longer
danced
before
his
eyes
before
he
had
time
to
realize
all
this
he
had
already
put
down
the
child
who
ran
back
to
the
meadow
to
play
astonished
the
soldier
began
to
say
to
himself
what
kind
of
water
was
this
that
the
child
gave
me
it
was
a
glorious
drink
i
must
really
show
him
my
but
inasmuch
as
he
hated
the
little
one
he
soon
dismissed
this
idea
it
is
only
a
child
thought
he
and
does
not
know
why
he
acts
in
this
way
or
that
way
he
plays
only
the
play
that
pleases
him
best
does
he
perhaps
receive
any
gratitude
from
the
bees
or
the
lilies
on
that
youngster
s
account
i
need
give
myself
no
trouble
he
doesn
t
even
know
that
he
has
succored
the
soldier
felt
if
possible
even
more
exasperated
with
the
child
a
moment
later
when
he
saw
the
commander
of
the
roman
soldiers
who
were
encamped
in
bethlehem
come
out
through
the
gate
just
see
what
a
risk
i
have
run
through
that
little
one
s
rash
behavior
thought
he
if
by
chance
voltigius
had
come
a
moment
earlier
he
would
have
seen
me
standing
with
a
child
in
my
meanwhile
the
commander
walked
straight
up
to
the
soldier
and
asked
him
if
they
might
speak
together
there
without
danger
of
being
overheard
he
had
a
secret
to
impart
to
him
if
we
move
ten
paces
from
the
gate
replied
the
soldier
no
one
can
hear
you
know
said
the
commander
that
king
herod
time
and
again
has
tried
to
get
possession
of
a
child
that
is
growing
up
here
in
bethlehem
his
soothsayers
and
priests
have
told
him
that
this
child
shall
ascend
his
throne
moreover
they
have
predicted
that
the
new
king
will
inaugurate
a
reign
of
peace
and
holiness
you
understand
of
course
that
herod
would
willingly
make
i
understand
said
the
soldier
eagerly
but
that
ought
to
be
the
easiest
thing
in
the
it
would
certainly
be
very
easy
said
the
commander
if
the
king
only
knew
which
one
of
all
the
children
here
in
bethlehem
is
the
the
soldier
knit
his
brows
it
is
a
pity
his
soothsayers
can
not
enlighten
him
about
this
said
he
but
now
herod
has
hit
upon
a
ruse
whereby
he
believes
he
can
make
the
young
harmless
continued
the
commander
he
promises
a
handsome
gift
to
each
and
all
who
will
help
whatsoever
voltigius
commands
shall
be
carried
out
even
without
money
or
gifts
said
the
soldier
i
thank
you
replied
the
commander
listen
now
to
the
king
s
plan
he
intends
to
celebrate
the
birthday
of
his
youngest
son
by
arranging
a
festival
to
which
all
male
children
in
bethlehem
who
are
between
the
ages
of
two
and
three
years
shall
be
bidden
together
with
their
mothers
and
during
this
he
checked
himself
suddenly
and
laughed
when
he
saw
the
look
of
disgust
on
the
soldier
s
face
my
friend
he
continued
you
need
not
fear
that
herod
thinks
of
using
us
as
now
bend
your
ear
to
my
mouth
and
i
ll
confide
to
you
his
the
commander
whispered
long
with
the
soldier
and
when
he
had
disclosed
all
he
said
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
absolute
silence
is
imperative
lest
the
whole
undertaking
you
know
voltigius
that
you
can
rely
on
me
said
the
soldier
when
the
commander
had
gone
and
the
soldier
once
more
stood
alone
at
his
post
he
looked
around
for
the
child
the
little
one
played
all
the
while
among
the
flowers
and
the
soldier
caught
himself
thinking
that
the
boy
swayed
above
them
as
light
and
attractive
as
a
butterfly
suddenly
he
began
to
laugh
true
said
he
i
shall
not
have
to
vex
myself
very
long
over
this
child
he
shall
be
bidden
to
the
feast
of
herod
this
he
remained
at
his
post
all
that
day
until
the
even
was
come
and
it
was
time
to
close
the
city
gate
for
the
night
when
this
was
done
he
wandered
through
narrow
and
dark
streets
to
a
splendid
palace
which
herod
owned
in
bethlehem
in
the
center
of
this
immense
palace
was
a
large
court
encircled
by
buildings
around
which
ran
three
open
galleries
one
above
the
other
the
king
had
ordered
that
the
festival
for
the
bethlehem
children
should
be
held
on
the
uppermost
of
these
galleries
this
gallery
by
the
king
s
express
command
was
transformed
so
that
it
looked
like
a
covered
walk
in
a
beautiful
the
ceiling
was
hidden
by
creeping
vines
hung
with
thick
clusters
of
luscious
grapes
and
alongside
the
walls
and
against
the
pillars
stood
small
pomegranate
trees
laden
with
ripe
fruit
the
floors
were
strewn
with
lying
thick
and
soft
like
a
carpet
and
all
along
the
balustrades
the
cornices
the
tables
and
the
low
divans
ran
garlands
of
lustrous
white
lilies
here
and
there
in
this
flower
garden
stood
great
marble
basins
where
glittering
gold
and
silver
fish
played
in
the
transparent
water
birds
from
distant
lands
sat
in
the
trees
and
in
a
cage
sat
an
old
raven
that
chattered
incessantly
when
the
festival
began
children
and
mothers
filed
into
the
gallery
immediately
after
they
had
entered
the
palace
the
children
were
arrayed
in
white
dresses
with
purple
borders
and
were
given
wreaths
of
roses
for
their
dark
curly
heads
the
women
came
in
regal
in
their
crimson
and
blue
robes
and
their
white
veils
which
hung
in
long
loose
folds
from
adorned
with
gold
coins
and
chains
some
carried
their
children
mounted
upon
their
shoulders
others
led
their
sons
by
the
hand
some
again
whose
children
were
afraid
or
shy
had
taken
them
up
in
their
arms
the
women
seated
themselves
on
the
floor
of
the
gallery
as
soon
as
they
had
taken
their
places
slaves
came
in
and
placed
before
them
low
tables
which
they
spread
with
the
choicest
of
foods
and
befitting
a
king
s
all
these
happy
mothers
began
to
eat
and
drink
maintaining
all
the
while
that
proud
graceful
dignity
which
is
the
greatest
ornament
of
the
bethlehem
women
along
the
farthest
wall
of
the
gallery
and
almost
hidden
by
and
fruit
trees
was
stationed
a
double
line
of
soldiers
in
full
armor
they
stood
perfectly
immovable
as
if
they
had
no
concern
with
that
which
went
on
around
them
the
women
could
not
refrain
from
casting
a
questioning
glance
now
and
then
at
this
troop
of
men
for
what
are
they
needed
here
they
whispered
does
herod
think
we
women
do
not
know
how
to
conduct
ourselves
does
he
believe
it
is
necessary
for
so
many
soldiers
to
guard
us
but
others
whispered
that
this
was
as
it
should
be
in
a
king
s
home
herod
himself
never
gave
a
banquet
without
having
his
house
filled
with
soldiers
it
was
to
honor
them
that
the
heavily
armored
warriors
stood
there
on
guard
during
the
first
few
moments
of
the
feast
the
children
felt
timid
and
uncertain
and
sat
quietly
beside
their
mothers
but
soon
they
began
to
move
about
and
take
possession
of
all
the
good
things
which
herod
offered
them
it
was
an
enchanted
land
that
the
king
had
created
for
his
little
guests
when
they
wandered
through
the
gallery
they
found
whose
honey
they
could
pillage
without
the
interference
of
a
single
crotchety
bee
they
found
trees
which
bending
lowered
their
branches
down
to
them
in
a
corner
they
found
magicians
who
on
the
instant
conjured
their
pockets
full
of
toys
and
in
another
corner
they
discovered
a
tamer
who
showed
them
a
pair
of
tigers
so
tame
that
they
could
ride
them
but
in
this
paradise
with
all
its
joys
there
was
nothing
which
so
attracted
the
attention
of
these
little
ones
as
the
long
line
of
soldiers
who
stood
immovable
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
gallery
their
eyes
were
captivated
by
their
shining
helmets
their
stern
haughty
faces
and
their
short
swords
which
reposed
in
richly
jeweled
sheaths
all
the
while
as
they
played
and
romped
with
one
another
they
thought
continually
about
the
soldiers
they
still
held
themselves
at
a
distance
but
they
longed
to
get
near
the
men
to
see
if
they
were
alive
and
really
could
move
themselves
the
play
and
festivities
increased
every
moment
but
the
soldiers
stood
all
the
while
immovable
it
seemed
incredible
to
the
little
ones
that
people
could
stand
so
near
the
clusters
of
grapes
and
all
the
other
dainties
without
reaching
out
a
hand
to
take
them
finally
there
was
one
boy
who
couldn
t
restrain
his
curiosity
any
longer
slowly
but
prepared
for
hasty
retreat
he
approached
one
of
the
armored
men
and
when
he
remained
just
as
rigid
and
motionless
the
child
came
nearer
and
nearer
at
last
he
was
so
close
to
him
that
he
could
touch
his
shoe
latchets
and
his
shins
though
this
had
been
an
at
once
these
set
themselves
in
motion
with
indescribable
fury
they
threw
themselves
upon
the
children
and
seized
them
some
swung
them
over
their
heads
like
missiles
and
flung
them
between
lamps
and
garlands
over
the
balustrade
and
down
to
the
court
where
they
were
killed
the
instant
they
struck
the
stone
pavement
others
drew
their
swords
and
pierced
the
children
s
hearts
others
again
crushed
their
heads
against
the
walls
before
they
threw
them
down
into
the
dark
courtyard
the
first
moment
after
the
onslaught
there
was
an
ominous
stillness
while
the
tiny
bodies
still
swayed
in
the
air
the
women
were
petrified
with
amazement
but
simultaneously
all
these
unhappy
mothers
awoke
to
understand
what
had
happened
and
with
one
great
cry
they
rushed
toward
the
soldiers
there
were
still
a
few
children
left
up
in
the
gallery
who
had
not
been
captured
during
the
first
attack
the
soldiers
pursued
them
and
their
mothers
threw
themselves
in
front
of
them
and
clutched
with
bare
hands
the
naked
swords
to
avert
the
several
women
whose
children
were
already
dead
threw
themselves
upon
the
soldiers
clutched
them
by
the
throat
and
sought
to
avenge
the
death
of
their
little
ones
by
strangling
their
murderers
during
this
wild
confusion
while
fearful
shrieks
rang
through
the
palace
and
the
most
inhuman
death
cruelties
were
being
enacted
the
soldier
who
was
wont
to
stand
on
guard
at
the
city
gate
stood
motionless
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
which
led
down
from
the
gallery
he
took
no
part
in
the
strife
and
the
murder
only
against
the
women
who
had
succeeded
in
snatching
their
children
and
tried
to
fly
down
the
stairs
with
them
did
he
lift
his
sword
and
just
the
sight
of
him
where
he
stood
grim
and
inflexible
was
so
terrifying
that
the
fleeing
ones
chose
rather
to
cast
themselves
over
the
balustrade
or
turn
back
into
the
heat
of
the
struggle
than
risk
the
danger
of
crowding
past
him
voltigius
certainly
did
the
right
thing
when
he
gave
this
post
thought
the
soldier
a
young
and
thoughtless
warrior
would
have
left
his
place
and
rushed
into
the
confusion
if
i
had
let
myself
be
tempted
away
from
here
ten
children
at
least
would
have
while
he
was
thinking
of
this
a
young
woman
who
had
snatched
up
her
child
came
rushing
towards
him
in
hurried
flight
none
of
the
warriors
whom
she
had
to
pass
could
stop
her
because
they
were
in
the
midst
of
the
struggle
with
other
women
and
in
this
way
she
had
reached
the
end
of
the
gallery
ah
there
s
one
who
is
about
to
escape
thought
the
soldier
neither
she
nor
the
child
is
the
woman
came
toward
the
soldier
with
such
speed
that
she
appeared
to
be
flying
and
he
didn
t
have
time
to
distinguish
the
features
of
either
the
woman
or
her
child
he
only
pointed
his
sword
at
them
and
the
woman
with
the
child
in
her
arms
dashed
against
it
he
expected
that
the
next
second
both
she
and
the
child
would
fall
to
the
ground
pierced
through
and
through
but
just
then
the
soldier
heard
an
angry
buzzing
over
his
head
and
the
next
instant
he
felt
a
sharp
pain
in
one
eye
it
was
so
intense
that
he
was
stunned
bewildered
and
the
sword
dropped
from
his
hand
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
eye
and
caught
hold
of
a
bee
and
understood
that
that
which
caused
this
awful
suffering
was
only
the
sting
of
the
tiny
creature
quick
as
a
flash
he
stooped
down
and
picked
up
his
sword
in
the
hope
that
as
yet
it
was
not
too
late
to
intercept
the
runaways
but
the
little
bee
had
done
its
work
very
well
during
the
short
time
that
the
soldier
was
blinded
the
young
mother
had
succeeded
in
rushing
past
him
and
down
the
stairs
and
although
he
hurried
after
her
with
all
haste
he
could
not
find
her
she
had
vanished
and
in
all
that
great
palace
there
was
no
one
who
could
discover
any
trace
of
her
the
following
morning
the
soldier
together
with
several
of
his
comrades
stood
on
guard
just
within
the
city
gate
the
hour
was
early
and
the
city
gates
had
only
just
been
opened
but
it
appeared
as
though
no
one
had
expected
that
they
would
be
opened
that
morning
for
no
throngs
of
field
laborers
streamed
out
of
the
city
as
they
usually
did
of
a
morning
all
the
bethlehem
inhabitants
were
so
filled
with
terror
over
the
night
s
bloodshed
that
no
one
dared
to
leave
his
home
by
my
sword
said
the
soldier
as
he
stood
and
stared
down
the
narrow
street
which
led
toward
the
gate
i
believe
voltigius
has
made
a
stupid
blunder
it
would
have
been
better
had
he
kept
the
gates
closed
and
ordered
a
thorough
search
of
every
house
in
the
city
until
he
had
found
the
boy
who
managed
to
escape
from
the
feast
voltigius
expects
that
his
parents
will
try
to
get
him
away
from
here
as
soon
as
they
learn
that
the
gates
are
open
i
fear
this
is
not
a
wise
calculation
how
easily
they
could
conceal
a
child
he
wondered
if
they
would
try
to
hide
the
child
in
a
fruit
basket
or
in
some
huge
oil
cask
or
amongst
the
of
a
caravan
while
he
stood
there
on
the
watch
for
any
attempt
to
deceive
him
in
this
way
he
saw
a
man
and
a
woman
who
came
hurriedly
down
the
street
and
were
nearing
the
gate
they
walked
rapidly
and
cast
anxious
looks
behind
them
as
though
they
were
fleeing
from
some
danger
the
man
held
an
ax
in
his
hand
with
a
firm
grip
as
if
determined
to
fight
should
any
one
bar
his
way
but
the
soldier
did
not
look
at
the
man
as
much
as
he
did
at
the
woman
he
thought
that
she
was
just
as
tall
as
the
young
mother
who
got
away
from
him
the
night
before
he
observed
also
that
she
had
thrown
her
skirt
over
her
head
perhaps
she
wears
it
like
this
thought
he
to
conceal
the
fact
that
she
holds
a
child
on
her
the
nearer
they
approached
the
plainer
he
saw
the
child
which
the
woman
bore
on
her
arm
outlined
under
the
raised
robe
i
m
positive
it
is
the
one
who
got
away
last
night
i
didn
t
see
her
face
but
i
recognize
the
tall
figure
and
here
she
comes
now
with
the
child
on
her
arm
and
without
even
trying
to
keep
it
concealed
i
had
not
dared
to
hope
for
such
a
lucky
chance
said
the
soldier
to
himself
the
man
and
woman
continued
their
rapid
pace
all
the
way
to
the
city
gate
evidently
they
had
not
anticipated
being
intercepted
here
they
trembled
with
fright
when
the
soldier
leveled
his
spear
at
them
and
barred
their
passage
why
do
you
refuse
to
let
us
go
out
in
the
fields
to
our
work
asked
the
man
you
may
go
presently
said
the
soldier
but
first
i
must
see
what
your
wife
has
hidden
behind
her
what
is
there
to
see
said
the
man
it
is
only
bread
and
wine
which
we
must
live
upon
you
speak
the
truth
perchance
said
the
soldier
but
if
it
is
as
you
say
why
does
she
turn
away
why
does
she
not
willingly
let
me
see
what
she
carries
i
do
not
wish
that
you
shall
see
it
said
the
man
and
i
command
you
to
let
us
pass
with
this
he
raised
his
ax
but
the
woman
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
enter
thou
not
into
strife
she
pleaded
i
will
try
some
other
way
i
shall
let
him
see
what
i
bear
and
i
know
that
he
can
not
harm
with
a
proud
and
confident
smile
she
turned
toward
the
soldier
and
threw
back
a
fold
of
her
robe
instantly
the
soldier
staggered
back
and
closed
his
eyes
as
if
dazed
by
a
strong
light
that
which
the
woman
held
concealed
under
her
robe
reflected
such
a
dazzling
white
light
that
at
first
he
did
not
know
what
he
saw
i
thought
you
held
a
child
on
your
arm
he
said
you
see
what
i
hold
the
woman
answered
then
the
soldier
finally
saw
that
that
which
dazzled
and
shone
was
only
a
cluster
of
white
lilies
the
same
kind
that
grew
in
the
meadow
but
their
luster
was
much
richer
and
more
radiant
he
could
hardly
bear
to
look
at
them
he
stuck
his
hand
in
among
the
flowers
he
couldn
t
help
thinking
that
it
must
be
a
child
the
woman
carried
but
he
felt
only
the
cool
he
was
bitterly
deceived
and
in
his
wrath
he
would
gladly
have
taken
both
the
man
and
the
woman
prisoners
but
he
knew
that
he
could
give
no
reason
for
such
a
proceeding
when
the
woman
saw
his
confusion
she
said
will
you
not
let
us
go
now
the
soldier
quietly
lowered
the
spear
and
stepped
aside
the
woman
drew
her
robe
over
the
flowers
once
more
and
at
the
same
time
she
looked
with
a
sweet
smile
upon
that
which
she
bore
on
her
arm
i
knew
that
you
could
not
harm
it
did
you
but
see
it
she
said
to
the
soldier
with
this
they
hastened
away
and
the
soldier
stood
and
stared
after
them
as
long
as
they
were
within
sight
while
he
followed
them
with
his
eyes
he
almost
felt
sure
that
the
woman
did
not
carry
on
her
arm
a
cluster
of
lilies
but
an
actual
living
child
while
he
still
stood
and
stared
after
the
wanderers
he
heard
loud
shouts
from
the
street
it
was
voltigius
with
several
of
his
men
who
came
running
stop
them
they
cried
close
the
gates
on
them
don
t
let
them
escape
and
when
they
came
up
to
the
soldier
they
said
that
they
had
tracked
the
runaway
boy
they
had
sought
him
in
his
home
but
then
he
had
escaped
again
they
had
seen
his
parents
hasten
away
with
him
the
father
was
a
strong
man
who
carried
an
ax
the
mother
was
a
tall
woman
who
held
a
child
concealed
under
a
raised
robe
the
same
moment
that
voltigius
related
this
there
came
a
bedouin
riding
in
through
the
gate
on
a
good
horse
without
a
word
the
soldier
rushed
up
to
the
rider
jerked
him
down
off
the
horse
and
threw
him
to
the
ground
and
with
one
bound
jumped
into
the
saddle
and
dashed
away
toward
the
road
two
days
later
the
soldier
rode
forward
through
the
dreary
which
is
the
whole
southern
part
of
judea
all
the
while
he
was
pursuing
the
three
fugitives
from
bethlehem
and
he
was
beside
himself
because
the
fruitless
hunt
never
came
to
an
end
it
looks
forsooth
as
though
these
creatures
had
the
power
to
sink
into
the
earth
he
grumbled
how
many
times
during
these
days
have
i
not
been
so
close
to
them
that
i
ve
been
on
the
point
of
throwing
my
spear
at
the
child
and
yet
they
have
escaped
me
i
begin
to
think
that
i
shall
never
catch
up
with
he
felt
despondent
like
one
who
believes
he
is
struggling
against
some
superior
power
he
asked
himself
if
it
might
not
be
possible
that
the
gods
protected
these
people
against
him
this
trouble
is
in
vain
let
me
turn
back
before
i
perish
from
hunger
and
thirst
in
this
barren
land
he
said
to
himself
again
and
again
then
he
was
seized
with
fear
of
that
which
awaited
him
on
his
should
he
turn
back
without
having
accomplished
his
mission
twice
he
had
permitted
the
child
to
escape
and
neither
voltigius
nor
herod
would
pardon
him
for
anything
of
the
kind
as
long
as
herod
knows
that
one
of
the
bethlehem
children
still
lives
he
will
always
be
haunted
by
the
same
anxiety
and
dread
said
the
soldier
most
likely
he
will
try
to
ease
his
worries
by
nailing
me
to
a
it
was
a
hot
noonday
hour
and
he
suffered
tortures
from
the
ride
through
this
mountain
district
on
a
road
which
wound
around
steep
cliffs
where
no
breeze
stirred
both
horse
and
rider
were
ready
to
drop
several
hours
before
he
had
lost
every
trace
of
the
fugitives
and
he
felt
more
disheartened
than
ever
i
must
give
it
up
thought
he
i
verily
believe
it
is
time
wasted
to
pursue
them
further
they
must
perish
anyway
in
this
awful
as
he
thought
this
he
discovered
in
a
near
the
roadside
the
vaulted
entrance
to
a
grotto
immediately
he
rode
up
to
the
opening
i
will
rest
a
while
in
this
cool
mountain
cave
thought
he
then
mayhap
i
can
continue
the
pursuit
with
renewed
as
he
was
about
to
enter
he
was
struck
with
amazement
on
each
side
of
the
opening
grew
a
beautiful
lily
the
two
stalks
stood
there
tall
and
erect
and
full
of
blossoms
they
sent
forth
an
intoxicating
odor
of
honey
and
many
bees
buzzed
around
them
it
was
such
an
uncommon
sight
in
this
wilderness
that
the
soldier
did
something
extraordinary
he
broke
off
a
large
white
flower
and
took
it
with
him
into
the
cave
the
cave
was
neither
deep
nor
dark
and
as
soon
as
he
entered
he
saw
that
there
were
already
three
travelers
within
a
man
a
woman
and
a
child
who
lay
stretched
out
upon
the
ground
lost
in
deep
slumber
the
soldier
had
never
before
felt
his
heart
beat
as
it
did
at
this
vision
they
were
the
three
runaways
whom
he
had
hunted
so
long
he
recognized
them
instantly
and
here
they
lay
sleeping
unable
to
defend
themselves
and
wholly
in
his
power
he
drew
his
sword
quickly
and
bent
over
the
sleeping
child
cautiously
he
lowered
the
sword
toward
the
infant
s
heart
and
measured
carefully
in
order
to
kill
with
a
single
thrust
he
paused
an
instant
to
look
at
the
child
s
countenance
now
when
he
was
certain
of
victory
he
felt
a
grim
pleasure
in
beholding
his
victim
but
when
he
saw
the
child
his
joy
increased
for
he
recognized
the
little
boy
whom
he
had
seen
play
with
bees
and
lilies
in
the
meadow
beyond
the
city
gate
why
of
course
i
should
have
understood
this
all
the
time
thought
he
this
is
why
i
have
always
hated
the
child
this
is
the
pretended
prince
of
he
lowered
his
sword
again
while
he
thought
when
i
lay
this
child
s
head
at
herod
s
feet
he
will
make
me
commander
of
his
life
as
he
brought
the
point
of
the
sword
nearer
and
nearer
the
heart
of
the
sleeping
child
he
reveled
in
the
thought
this
time
at
least
no
one
shall
come
between
us
and
snatch
him
from
my
but
the
soldier
still
held
in
his
hand
the
lily
which
he
had
broken
off
at
the
grotto
entrance
and
while
he
was
thinking
of
his
good
fortune
a
bee
that
had
been
hidden
in
its
chalice
flew
towards
him
and
buzzed
around
his
head
he
staggered
back
suddenly
he
remembered
the
bees
which
the
boy
had
carried
to
their
home
and
he
remembered
that
it
was
a
bee
that
had
helped
the
child
escape
from
herod
s
feast
this
thought
struck
him
with
surprise
he
held
the
sword
suspended
and
stood
still
and
listened
for
the
bee
now
he
did
not
hear
the
tiny
creature
s
buzzing
as
he
stood
there
perfectly
still
he
became
conscious
of
the
strong
delicious
perfume
which
came
from
the
lily
that
he
held
in
his
hand
then
he
began
to
think
of
the
lilies
that
the
little
one
had
saved
he
remembered
that
it
was
a
cluster
of
lilies
that
had
hidden
the
child
from
his
view
and
made
possible
the
escape
through
the
city
gate
he
became
more
and
more
thoughtful
and
he
drew
back
the
sword
the
bees
and
the
lilies
have
requited
his
good
deeds
he
whispered
to
himself
then
he
was
struck
by
the
thought
that
the
little
one
had
once
shown
even
him
a
kindness
and
a
deep
crimson
flush
mounted
to
his
brow
can
a
roman
soldier
forget
to
requite
an
accepted
service
he
whispered
he
fought
a
short
battle
with
himself
he
thought
of
herod
and
of
his
own
desire
to
destroy
the
young
it
does
not
become
me
to
murder
this
child
who
has
saved
my
life
he
said
at
last
and
he
bent
down
and
laid
his
sword
beside
the
child
that
the
fugitives
on
awakening
should
understand
the
danger
they
had
escaped
then
he
saw
that
the
child
was
awake
he
lay
and
regarded
the
soldier
with
the
beautiful
eyes
which
shone
like
stars
and
the
warrior
bent
a
knee
before
the
child
lord
art
the
mighty
one
said
he
thou
art
the
strong
conqueror
thou
art
he
whom
the
gods
love
thou
art
he
who
shall
tread
upon
adders
and
scorpions
he
kissed
his
feet
and
stole
softly
out
from
the
grotto
while
the
little
one
smiled
and
smiled
after
him
with
great
astonished
illustration
the
flight
into
egypt
the
flight
into
egypt
far
away
in
one
of
the
eastern
deserts
many
many
years
ago
grew
a
palm
tree
which
was
both
exceedingly
old
and
exceedingly
tall
all
who
passed
through
the
desert
had
to
stop
and
gaze
at
it
for
it
was
much
larger
than
other
palms
and
they
used
to
say
of
it
that
some
day
it
would
certainly
be
taller
than
the
obelisks
and
pyramids
where
the
huge
palm
tree
stood
in
its
solitude
and
looked
out
over
the
desert
it
saw
something
one
day
which
made
its
mighty
sway
back
and
forth
on
its
slender
trunk
with
astonishment
over
by
the
desert
borders
walked
two
human
beings
they
were
still
at
the
distance
at
which
camels
appear
to
be
as
tiny
as
moths
but
they
were
certainly
two
human
who
were
strangers
in
the
desert
for
the
palm
knew
the
they
were
a
man
and
a
woman
who
had
neither
guide
nor
neither
tent
nor
verily
said
the
palm
to
itself
these
two
have
come
hither
only
to
meet
certain
the
palm
cast
a
quick
apprehensive
glance
around
it
surprises
me
it
said
that
the
lions
are
not
already
out
to
hunt
this
prey
but
i
do
not
see
a
single
one
astir
nor
do
i
see
any
of
the
desert
robbers
but
they
ll
probably
soon
a
death
awaits
these
travelers
thought
the
palm
the
lions
will
devour
them
thirst
will
parch
them
the
will
bury
them
robbers
will
trap
them
sunstroke
will
blight
them
and
fear
will
destroy
and
the
palm
tried
to
think
of
something
else
the
fate
of
these
people
made
it
sad
at
heart
but
on
the
whole
desert
plain
which
lay
spread
out
beneath
the
palm
there
was
nothing
which
it
had
not
known
and
looked
upon
these
thousand
years
nothing
in
particular
could
arrest
its
attention
again
it
had
to
think
of
the
two
wanderers
by
the
drought
and
the
storm
said
the
palm
calling
upon
life
s
most
dangerous
enemies
what
is
that
that
the
woman
carries
on
her
arm
i
believe
these
fools
also
bring
a
little
child
with
them
the
palm
who
was
the
old
usually
are
saw
aright
the
woman
bore
on
her
arm
a
child
that
leaned
against
her
shoulder
and
slept
the
child
hasn
t
even
sufficient
clothing
on
said
the
palm
i
see
that
the
mother
has
tucked
up
her
skirt
and
thrown
it
over
the
child
she
must
have
snatched
him
from
his
bed
in
great
haste
and
rushed
off
with
him
i
understand
now
these
people
are
runaways
but
they
are
fools
nevertheless
continued
the
palm
unless
an
angel
protects
them
they
would
have
done
better
to
have
let
their
enemies
do
their
worst
than
to
venture
into
this
wilderness
i
can
imagine
how
the
whole
thing
came
about
the
man
stood
at
his
work
the
child
slept
in
his
crib
the
woman
had
gone
out
to
fetch
water
when
she
was
a
few
steps
from
the
door
she
saw
enemies
coming
she
rushed
back
to
the
house
snatched
up
her
child
and
fled
since
then
they
have
been
fleeing
for
several
days
it
is
very
certain
that
they
have
not
rested
a
moment
yes
everything
has
happened
in
this
way
but
still
i
say
that
unless
an
angel
protects
they
are
so
frightened
that
as
yet
they
feel
neither
fatigue
nor
suffering
but
i
see
their
thirst
by
the
strange
gleam
in
their
eyes
surely
i
ought
to
know
a
thirsty
person
s
face
and
when
the
palm
began
to
think
of
thirst
a
shudder
passed
through
its
tall
trunk
and
the
long
leaves
numberless
lobes
rolled
up
as
though
they
had
been
held
over
a
fire
were
i
a
human
being
it
said
i
should
never
venture
into
the
desert
he
is
pretty
brave
who
dares
come
here
without
having
roots
that
reach
down
to
the
water
veins
here
it
can
be
dangerous
even
for
palms
yea
even
for
a
palm
such
as
i
if
i
could
counsel
them
i
should
beg
them
to
turn
back
their
enemies
could
never
be
as
cruel
toward
them
as
the
desert
perhaps
they
think
it
is
easy
to
live
in
the
desert
but
i
know
that
now
and
then
even
i
have
found
it
hard
to
keep
alive
i
recollect
one
time
in
my
youth
when
a
hurricane
threw
a
whole
mountain
of
sand
over
me
i
came
near
choking
if
i
could
have
died
that
would
have
been
my
last
the
palm
continued
to
think
aloud
as
the
aged
and
solitary
habitually
do
i
hear
a
wondrously
beautiful
melody
rush
through
my
leaves
it
said
all
the
lobes
on
my
leaves
are
quivering
i
know
not
what
it
is
that
takes
possession
of
me
at
the
sight
of
these
poor
strangers
but
this
unfortunate
woman
is
so
beautiful
she
carries
me
back
in
memory
to
the
most
wonderful
thing
that
i
ever
and
while
the
leaves
continued
to
move
in
a
soft
melody
the
palm
was
reminded
how
once
very
long
ago
two
illustrious
personages
had
visited
the
oasis
they
were
the
queen
of
sheba
and
solomon
the
wise
the
beautiful
queen
was
to
return
to
her
own
country
the
king
had
accompanied
her
on
the
journey
and
now
they
were
going
to
part
in
remembrance
of
this
hour
said
the
queen
then
i
now
plant
a
date
seed
in
the
earth
and
i
wish
that
from
it
shall
spring
a
palm
which
shall
grow
and
live
until
a
king
shall
arise
in
judea
greater
than
and
when
she
had
said
this
she
planted
the
seed
in
the
earth
and
watered
it
with
her
tears
how
does
it
happen
that
i
am
thinking
of
this
just
said
the
palm
can
this
woman
be
so
beautiful
that
she
reminds
me
of
the
most
glorious
of
queens
of
her
by
whose
word
i
have
lived
and
flourished
until
this
day
i
hear
my
leaves
rustle
louder
and
louder
said
the
palm
and
it
sounds
as
melancholy
as
a
dirge
it
is
as
though
they
prophesied
that
some
one
would
soon
leave
this
life
it
is
well
to
know
that
it
does
not
apply
to
me
since
i
can
not
the
palm
assumed
that
the
in
its
leaves
must
apply
to
the
two
lone
wanderers
it
is
certain
that
they
too
believed
that
their
last
hour
was
nearing
one
saw
it
from
their
expression
as
they
walked
past
the
skeleton
of
a
camel
which
lay
in
their
path
one
saw
it
from
the
glances
they
cast
back
at
a
pair
of
passing
vultures
it
couldn
t
be
otherwise
they
must
perish
they
had
caught
sight
of
the
palm
and
oasis
and
hastened
thither
to
find
water
but
when
they
arrived
at
last
they
collapsed
from
despair
for
the
well
was
dry
the
woman
worn
out
laid
the
child
down
and
seated
herself
beside
the
and
wept
the
man
flung
himself
down
beside
her
and
beat
upon
the
dry
earth
with
his
fists
the
palm
heard
how
they
talked
with
each
other
about
their
inevitable
death
it
also
gleaned
from
their
conversation
that
king
herod
had
ordered
the
slaughter
of
all
male
children
from
two
to
three
years
old
because
he
feared
that
the
king
of
the
jews
had
been
born
it
rustles
louder
and
louder
in
my
leaves
said
the
palm
these
poor
fugitives
will
soon
see
their
last
it
perceived
also
that
they
dreaded
the
desert
the
man
said
it
would
have
been
better
if
they
had
stayed
at
home
and
fought
with
the
soldiers
than
to
fly
hither
he
said
that
they
would
have
met
an
easier
death
god
will
help
us
said
the
woman
we
are
alone
among
beasts
of
prey
and
serpents
said
the
man
we
have
no
food
and
no
water
how
should
god
be
able
to
help
us
in
despair
he
rent
his
garments
and
pressed
his
face
against
the
dry
earth
he
was
a
man
with
a
in
his
heart
the
woman
sat
erect
with
her
hands
clasped
over
her
knees
but
the
looks
she
cast
towards
the
desert
spoke
of
a
hopelessness
beyond
bounds
the
palm
heard
the
melancholy
rustle
in
its
leaves
growing
louder
and
louder
the
woman
must
have
heard
it
also
for
she
turned
her
gaze
upward
toward
the
and
instantly
she
involuntarily
raised
her
arms
oh
dates
dates
she
cried
there
was
such
intense
agony
in
her
voice
that
the
old
palm
wished
itself
no
taller
than
a
broom
and
that
the
dates
were
as
easy
to
reach
as
the
buds
on
a
brier
bush
it
probably
knew
that
its
crown
was
full
of
date
clusters
but
how
should
a
human
being
reach
such
a
height
the
man
had
already
seen
how
beyond
all
reach
the
date
clusters
hung
he
did
not
even
raise
his
head
he
begged
his
wife
not
to
long
for
the
impossible
but
the
child
who
had
toddled
about
by
himself
and
played
with
sticks
and
straws
had
heard
the
mother
s
outcry
of
course
the
little
one
could
not
imagine
that
his
mother
should
not
get
everything
she
wished
for
the
instant
she
said
dates
he
began
to
stare
at
the
tree
he
pondered
and
pondered
how
he
should
bring
down
the
dates
his
forehead
was
almost
drawn
into
wrinkles
under
the
golden
curls
at
last
a
smile
stole
over
his
face
he
had
found
the
way
he
went
up
to
the
palm
and
stroked
it
with
his
little
hand
and
said
in
a
sweet
childish
voice
palm
bend
thee
palm
bend
thee
but
what
was
that
what
was
that
the
palm
leaves
rustled
as
if
a
hurricane
had
passed
through
them
and
up
and
down
the
long
trunk
traveled
shudder
upon
shudder
and
the
tree
felt
that
the
little
one
was
its
superior
it
could
not
resist
him
and
it
bowed
its
long
trunk
before
the
child
as
people
bow
before
princes
in
a
great
bow
it
bent
itself
towards
the
ground
and
finally
it
came
down
so
far
that
the
big
crown
with
the
trembling
leaves
swept
the
desert
sand
the
child
appeared
to
be
neither
frightened
nor
surprised
with
a
joyous
cry
he
loosened
cluster
after
cluster
from
the
old
palm
s
crown
when
he
had
plucked
enough
dates
and
the
tree
still
lay
on
the
ground
the
child
came
back
again
and
caressed
it
and
said
in
the
gentlest
voice
palm
raise
thee
palm
raise
thee
slowly
and
reverently
the
big
tree
raised
itself
on
its
slender
trunk
while
the
leaves
played
like
harps
now
i
know
for
whom
they
are
playing
the
death
melody
said
the
palm
to
itself
when
it
stood
erect
once
more
it
is
not
for
any
of
these
the
man
and
the
woman
sank
upon
their
knees
and
thanked
god
thou
hast
seen
our
agony
and
removed
it
thou
art
the
powerful
one
who
bendest
the
like
a
reed
what
enemy
should
we
fear
when
thy
strength
protects
us
the
next
time
a
caravan
passed
through
the
desert
the
travelers
saw
that
the
great
palm
s
had
withered
how
can
this
be
said
a
traveler
this
palm
was
not
to
die
before
it
had
seen
a
king
greater
than
mayhap
it
hath
seen
him
answered
another
of
the
desert
travelers
illustration
in
nazareth
in
nazareth
once
when
jesus
was
only
five
years
old
he
sat
on
the
doorstep
outside
his
father
s
workshop
in
nazareth
and
made
clay
cuckoos
from
a
lump
of
clay
which
the
potter
across
the
way
had
given
him
he
was
happier
than
usual
all
the
children
in
the
quarter
had
told
jesus
that
the
potter
was
a
disobliging
man
who
wouldn
t
let
himself
be
coaxed
either
by
soft
glances
or
honeyed
words
and
he
had
never
dared
ask
aught
of
him
but
you
see
he
hardly
knew
how
it
had
come
about
he
had
only
stood
on
his
doorstep
and
with
yearning
eyes
looked
upon
the
neighbor
working
at
his
molds
and
then
that
neighbor
had
come
over
from
his
stall
and
given
him
so
much
clay
that
it
would
have
been
enough
to
finish
a
whole
wine
jug
on
the
stoop
of
the
next
house
sat
judas
his
face
covered
with
bruises
and
his
clothes
full
of
rents
which
he
had
acquired
during
his
continual
fights
with
street
urchins
for
the
moment
he
was
quiet
he
neither
quarreled
nor
fought
but
worked
with
a
bit
of
clay
just
as
jesus
did
but
this
clay
he
had
not
been
able
to
procure
for
himself
he
hardly
dared
venture
within
sight
of
the
potter
who
complained
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
throwing
stones
at
his
fragile
wares
and
would
have
driven
him
away
with
a
good
beating
it
was
jesus
who
had
divided
his
portion
with
him
when
the
two
children
had
finished
their
clay
cuckoos
they
stood
the
birds
up
in
a
ring
in
front
of
them
these
looked
just
as
clay
cuckoos
have
always
looked
they
had
big
round
lumps
to
stand
on
in
place
of
feet
short
tails
no
necks
and
almost
imperceptible
wings
but
at
all
events
one
saw
at
once
a
difference
in
the
work
of
the
little
playmates
judas
birds
were
so
crooked
that
they
tumbled
over
continually
and
no
matter
how
hard
he
worked
with
his
clumsy
little
fingers
he
couldn
t
get
their
bodies
neat
and
well
formed
now
and
then
he
glanced
slyly
at
jesus
to
see
how
he
managed
to
make
his
birds
as
smooth
and
even
as
the
in
the
forests
on
mount
tabor
as
bird
after
bird
was
finished
jesus
became
happier
and
happier
each
looked
more
beautiful
to
him
than
the
last
and
he
regarded
them
all
with
pride
and
affection
they
were
to
be
his
playmates
his
little
brothers
they
should
sleep
in
his
bed
keep
him
company
and
sing
to
him
when
his
mother
left
him
never
before
had
he
thought
himself
so
rich
never
again
could
he
feel
alone
or
forsaken
the
big
brawny
came
walking
along
and
right
after
him
came
the
huckster
who
sat
joggingly
on
his
donkey
between
the
large
empty
willow
baskets
the
laid
his
hand
on
jesus
curly
head
and
asked
him
about
his
birds
and
jesus
told
him
that
they
had
names
and
that
they
could
sing
all
the
little
birds
were
come
to
him
from
foreign
lands
and
told
him
things
which
only
he
and
they
knew
and
jesus
spoke
in
such
a
way
that
both
the
and
the
huckster
forgot
about
their
tasks
for
a
full
hour
to
listen
to
him
but
when
they
wished
to
go
farther
jesus
pointed
to
judas
see
what
pretty
birds
judas
makes
he
said
then
the
huckster
stopped
his
donkey
and
asked
judas
if
his
birds
also
had
names
and
could
sing
but
judas
knew
nothing
of
this
he
was
stubbornly
silent
and
did
not
raise
his
eyes
from
his
work
and
the
huckster
angrily
kicked
one
of
his
birds
and
rode
on
in
this
manner
the
afternoon
passed
and
the
sun
sank
so
far
down
that
its
beams
could
come
in
through
the
low
city
gate
which
stood
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
was
decorated
with
a
roman
eagle
this
sunshine
which
came
at
the
close
of
the
day
was
perfectly
if
it
had
become
mixed
with
it
colored
everything
which
came
in
its
path
as
it
filtered
through
the
narrow
street
it
painted
the
potter
s
vessels
as
well
as
the
log
which
creaked
under
the
woodman
s
saw
and
the
white
veil
that
covered
mary
s
face
but
the
loveliest
of
all
was
the
sun
s
reflection
as
it
shone
on
the
little
which
had
gathered
in
the
big
uneven
cracks
in
the
stones
that
covered
the
street
suddenly
jesus
stuck
his
hand
in
the
puddle
nearest
him
he
had
conceived
the
idea
that
he
would
paint
his
gray
birds
with
the
sparkling
sunbeams
which
had
given
such
pretty
color
to
the
water
the
and
everything
around
him
the
sunshine
took
pleasure
in
letting
itself
be
captured
by
him
like
paint
in
a
paint
pot
and
when
jesus
spread
it
over
the
little
clay
birds
it
lay
still
and
bedecked
them
from
head
to
feet
with
a
luster
judas
who
every
now
and
then
looked
at
jesus
to
see
if
he
made
more
and
prettier
birds
than
his
gave
a
shriek
of
delight
when
he
saw
how
jesus
painted
his
clay
cuckoos
with
the
sunshine
which
he
caught
from
the
water
pools
judas
also
dipped
his
hand
in
the
shining
water
and
tried
to
catch
the
sunshine
but
the
sunshine
wouldn
t
be
caught
by
him
it
slipped
through
his
fingers
and
no
matter
how
fast
he
tried
to
move
his
hands
to
get
hold
of
it
it
got
away
and
he
couldn
t
procure
a
pinch
of
color
for
his
poor
birds
wait
judas
said
jesus
i
ll
come
and
paint
your
no
you
shan
t
touch
them
cried
judas
they
re
good
enough
as
they
he
rose
his
eyebrows
contracted
into
an
ugly
frown
his
lips
compressed
and
he
put
his
broad
foot
on
the
birds
and
transformed
them
one
after
another
into
little
flat
pieces
of
clay
when
all
his
birds
were
destroyed
he
walked
over
to
jesus
who
sat
and
caressed
his
glittered
like
jewels
judas
regarded
them
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
raised
his
foot
and
crushed
one
of
them
when
judas
took
his
foot
away
and
saw
the
entire
little
bird
changed
into
a
cake
of
clay
he
felt
so
relieved
that
he
began
to
laugh
and
raised
his
foot
to
crush
another
judas
said
jesus
what
are
you
doing
don
t
you
see
that
they
are
alive
and
can
sing
but
judas
laughed
and
crushed
still
another
bird
jesus
looked
around
for
help
judas
was
heavily
built
and
jesus
had
not
the
strength
to
hold
him
back
he
glanced
around
for
his
mother
she
was
not
far
away
but
before
she
could
have
gone
there
judas
would
have
had
ample
time
to
destroy
the
birds
the
tears
sprang
to
jesus
eyes
judas
had
already
crushed
four
of
his
birds
there
were
only
three
left
he
was
annoyed
with
his
birds
who
stood
so
calmly
and
let
themselves
be
trampled
upon
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
the
danger
jesus
clapped
his
hands
to
awaken
them
then
he
shouted
fly
fly
then
the
three
birds
began
to
move
their
tiny
wings
and
fluttering
anxiously
they
succeeded
in
swinging
themselves
up
to
the
eaves
of
the
house
where
they
were
safe
but
when
judas
saw
that
the
birds
took
to
their
wings
and
flew
at
jesus
command
he
began
to
weep
he
tore
his
hair
as
he
had
seen
his
elders
do
when
they
were
in
great
trouble
and
he
threw
himself
at
jesus
feet
judas
lay
there
and
rolled
in
the
dust
before
jesus
like
a
dog
and
kissed
his
feet
and
begged
that
he
would
raise
his
foot
and
crush
him
as
he
had
done
with
the
clay
cuckoos
for
judas
loved
jesus
and
admired
and
worshiped
him
and
at
the
same
time
hated
him
mary
who
sat
all
the
while
and
watched
the
children
s
play
came
up
and
lifted
judas
in
her
arms
and
seated
him
on
her
lap
and
caressed
him
you
poor
child
she
said
to
him
you
do
not
know
that
you
have
attempted
something
which
no
mortal
can
accomplish
don
t
engage
in
anything
of
this
kind
again
if
you
do
not
wish
to
become
the
unhappiest
of
mortals
what
would
happen
to
any
one
of
us
who
undertook
to
compete
with
one
who
paints
with
sunbeams
and
blows
the
breath
of
life
into
dead
clay
illustration
in
the
temple
in
the
temple
once
there
was
a
poor
man
his
wife
and
their
little
walked
about
in
the
big
temple
at
jerusalem
the
son
was
such
a
pretty
child
he
had
hair
which
fell
in
long
even
curls
and
eyes
that
shone
like
stars
the
son
had
not
been
in
the
temple
since
he
was
big
enough
to
comprehend
what
he
saw
and
now
his
parents
showed
him
all
its
glories
there
were
long
rows
of
pillars
and
gilded
altars
there
were
holy
men
who
sat
and
instructed
their
pupils
there
was
the
high
priest
with
his
breastplate
of
precious
stones
there
were
the
curtains
from
babylon
interwoven
with
gold
roses
there
were
the
great
copper
gates
which
were
so
heavy
that
it
was
hard
work
for
thirty
men
to
swing
them
back
and
forth
on
their
hinges
but
the
little
boy
who
was
only
twelve
years
old
did
not
care
very
much
about
seeing
all
this
his
mother
told
him
that
that
which
she
showed
him
was
the
most
marvelous
in
all
the
world
she
told
him
that
it
would
probably
be
a
long
time
before
he
should
see
anything
like
it
again
in
the
poor
town
of
nazareth
where
they
lived
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
gray
streets
her
exhortations
did
not
help
matters
much
the
little
boy
looked
as
though
he
would
willingly
have
run
away
from
the
magnificent
temple
if
instead
he
could
have
got
out
and
played
on
the
narrow
street
in
nazareth
but
it
was
singular
that
the
more
indifferent
the
boy
appeared
the
more
pleased
and
happy
were
the
parents
they
nodded
to
each
other
over
his
head
and
were
thoroughly
satisfied
at
last
the
little
one
looked
so
tired
and
bored
that
the
mother
felt
sorry
for
him
now
we
have
walked
too
far
with
you
said
she
come
you
shall
rest
a
she
sat
down
beside
a
pillar
and
told
him
to
lie
down
on
the
ground
and
rest
his
head
on
her
knee
he
did
so
and
fell
asleep
instantly
he
had
barely
closed
his
eyes
when
the
wife
said
to
the
husband
i
have
never
feared
anything
so
much
as
the
moment
when
he
should
come
here
to
jerusalem
s
temple
i
believed
that
when
he
saw
this
house
of
god
he
would
wish
to
stay
here
i
too
have
been
afraid
of
this
journey
said
the
man
at
the
time
of
his
birth
many
signs
and
wonders
appeared
which
betokened
that
he
would
become
a
great
ruler
but
what
could
royal
honors
bring
him
except
worries
and
dangers
i
have
always
said
that
it
would
be
best
both
for
him
and
for
us
if
he
never
became
anything
but
a
carpenter
in
since
his
fifth
year
said
the
mother
reflectively
no
miracles
have
happened
around
him
and
he
does
not
recall
any
of
the
wonders
which
occurred
during
his
early
childhood
now
he
is
exactly
like
a
child
among
other
children
god
s
will
be
done
above
all
else
but
i
have
almost
begun
to
hope
that
our
lord
in
his
mercy
will
choose
another
for
the
great
destinies
and
let
me
keep
my
son
with
for
my
part
said
the
man
i
am
certain
that
if
he
learns
nothing
of
the
signs
and
wonders
which
occurred
during
his
first
years
then
all
will
go
i
never
speak
with
him
about
any
of
these
marvels
said
the
wife
but
i
fear
all
the
while
that
without
my
having
aught
to
do
with
it
something
will
happen
which
will
make
him
understand
who
he
is
i
feared
most
of
all
to
bring
him
to
this
you
may
be
glad
that
the
danger
is
over
now
said
the
man
we
shall
soon
have
him
back
home
in
i
have
feared
the
wise
men
in
the
temple
said
the
woman
i
have
dreaded
the
soothsayers
who
sit
here
on
their
rugs
i
believed
that
when
he
should
come
to
their
notice
they
would
stand
up
and
bow
before
the
child
and
greet
him
as
judea
s
king
it
is
singular
that
they
do
not
notice
his
beauty
such
a
child
has
never
before
come
under
their
she
sat
in
silence
a
moment
and
regarded
the
child
i
can
hardly
understand
it
said
she
i
believed
that
when
he
should
see
these
judges
who
sit
in
the
house
of
the
holy
one
and
settle
the
people
s
disputes
and
these
teachers
who
talk
with
their
pupils
and
these
priests
who
serve
the
lord
he
would
wake
up
and
say
it
is
here
among
these
judges
these
teachers
these
priests
that
i
am
born
to
what
happiness
would
there
be
for
him
to
sit
shut
in
between
these
interposed
the
man
it
is
better
for
him
to
roam
on
the
hills
and
mountains
round
about
the
mother
sighed
a
little
he
is
so
happy
at
home
with
us
said
she
how
contented
he
seems
when
he
can
follow
the
shepherds
on
their
lonely
wanderings
or
when
he
can
go
out
in
the
fields
and
see
the
husbandmen
labor
i
can
not
believe
that
we
are
treating
him
wrongly
when
we
seek
to
keep
him
for
we
only
spare
him
the
greatest
suffering
said
the
man
they
continued
talking
together
in
this
strain
until
the
child
awoke
from
his
slumber
well
said
the
mother
have
you
had
a
good
rest
stand
up
now
for
it
is
drawing
on
toward
evening
and
we
must
return
to
the
they
were
in
the
most
remote
part
of
the
building
and
so
began
the
walk
towards
the
entrance
they
had
to
go
through
an
old
arch
which
had
been
there
ever
since
the
time
when
the
first
temple
was
erected
on
this
spot
and
near
the
arch
propped
against
a
wall
stood
an
old
copper
trumpet
enormous
in
length
and
weight
almost
like
a
pillar
to
raise
to
the
mouth
and
play
upon
it
stood
there
dented
and
battered
full
of
dust
and
spiders
webs
inside
and
outside
and
covered
with
an
almost
invisible
tracing
of
ancient
letters
probably
a
thousand
years
had
gone
by
since
any
one
had
tried
to
coax
a
tone
out
of
it
but
when
the
little
boy
saw
the
huge
trumpet
he
what
is
that
he
asked
that
is
the
great
trumpet
called
the
voice
of
the
prince
of
this
world
replied
the
mother
with
this
moses
called
together
the
children
of
israel
when
they
were
scattered
over
the
wilderness
since
his
time
no
one
has
been
able
to
coax
a
single
tone
from
it
but
he
who
can
do
this
shall
gather
all
the
peoples
of
earth
under
his
she
smiled
at
this
which
she
believed
to
be
an
old
myth
but
the
little
boy
remained
standing
beside
the
big
trumpet
until
she
called
him
this
trumpet
was
the
first
thing
he
had
seen
in
the
temple
that
he
liked
they
had
not
gone
far
before
they
came
to
a
big
wide
here
in
the
itself
was
a
chasm
deep
and
as
it
had
been
from
time
immemorial
this
chasm
king
solomon
had
not
wished
to
fill
in
when
he
built
the
temple
no
bridge
had
been
laid
over
it
no
inclosure
had
he
built
around
the
steep
abyss
but
instead
he
had
stretched
across
it
a
sword
of
steel
several
feet
long
sharpened
and
with
the
blade
up
and
after
ages
and
ages
and
many
changes
the
sword
still
lay
across
the
chasm
now
it
had
almost
rusted
away
it
was
no
longer
securely
fastened
at
the
ends
but
trembled
and
rocked
as
soon
as
any
one
walked
with
heavy
steps
in
the
temple
court
when
the
mother
took
the
boy
in
a
roundabout
way
past
the
chasm
he
asked
what
bridge
is
this
it
was
placed
there
by
king
solomon
answered
the
mother
and
we
call
it
paradise
bridge
if
you
can
cross
the
chasm
on
this
trembling
bridge
whose
surface
is
thinner
than
a
sunbeam
then
you
can
be
sure
of
getting
to
she
smiled
and
moved
away
but
the
boy
stood
still
and
looked
at
the
narrow
trembling
steel
blade
until
she
called
him
when
he
obeyed
her
she
sighed
because
she
had
not
shown
him
these
two
remarkable
things
sooner
so
that
he
might
have
had
sufficient
time
to
view
them
now
they
walked
on
without
being
detained
till
they
came
to
the
great
entrance
portico
with
its
columns
here
in
a
corner
were
two
black
marble
pillars
erected
on
the
same
foundation
and
so
close
to
each
other
that
hardly
a
straw
could
be
squeezed
in
between
them
they
were
tall
and
majestic
with
richly
ornamented
capitals
around
which
ran
a
row
of
peculiarly
formed
beasts
heads
and
there
was
not
an
inch
on
these
beautiful
pillars
that
did
not
bear
marks
and
scratches
they
were
worn
and
damaged
like
nothing
else
in
the
temple
even
the
floor
around
them
was
worn
smooth
and
was
somewhat
hollowed
out
from
the
wear
of
many
feet
once
more
the
boy
stopped
his
mother
and
asked
what
pillars
are
these
they
are
pillars
which
our
father
abraham
brought
with
him
to
palestine
from
chaldea
and
which
he
called
righteousness
gate
he
who
can
squeeze
between
them
is
righteous
before
god
and
has
never
committed
a
the
boy
stood
still
and
regarded
these
pillars
with
great
open
eyes
you
surely
do
not
think
of
trying
to
squeeze
yourself
in
between
them
laughed
the
mother
you
see
how
the
floor
around
them
is
worn
away
by
the
many
who
have
attempted
to
force
their
way
through
the
narrow
space
but
believe
me
no
one
has
succeeded
make
haste
i
hear
the
clanging
of
the
copper
gates
the
thirty
temple
servants
have
put
their
shoulders
to
but
all
night
the
little
boy
lay
awake
in
the
tent
and
he
saw
before
him
nothing
but
righteousness
gate
and
paradise
bridge
and
the
voice
of
the
prince
of
this
world
never
before
had
he
heard
of
such
wonderful
things
and
he
couldn
t
get
them
out
of
his
head
and
on
the
morning
of
the
next
day
it
was
the
same
thing
he
couldn
t
think
of
anything
else
that
morning
they
were
to
leave
for
home
the
parents
had
much
to
do
before
they
took
the
tent
down
and
loaded
it
upon
a
big
camel
and
before
everything
else
was
in
order
they
were
not
going
to
travel
alone
but
in
company
with
many
relatives
and
neighbors
and
since
there
were
so
many
the
packing
naturally
went
on
very
slowly
the
little
boy
did
not
assist
in
the
work
but
in
the
midst
of
the
hurry
and
confusion
he
sat
still
and
thought
about
the
three
wonderful
things
suddenly
he
concluded
that
he
would
have
time
enough
to
go
back
to
the
temple
and
take
another
look
at
them
there
was
still
much
to
be
packed
away
he
could
probably
manage
to
get
back
from
the
temple
before
the
departure
he
hastened
away
without
telling
any
one
where
he
was
going
to
he
didn
t
think
it
was
necessary
he
would
soon
return
of
course
it
wasn
t
long
before
he
reached
the
temple
and
entered
the
portico
where
the
two
pillars
stood
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
his
eyes
danced
with
joy
he
sat
down
on
the
floor
beside
them
and
gazed
up
at
them
as
he
thought
that
he
who
could
squeeze
between
these
two
pillars
was
accounted
righteous
before
god
and
had
never
committed
sin
he
fancied
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
wonderful
he
thought
how
glorious
it
would
be
to
be
able
to
squeeze
in
between
the
two
pillars
but
they
stood
so
close
together
that
it
was
impossible
even
to
try
it
in
this
way
he
sat
motionless
before
the
pillars
for
an
hour
but
this
he
did
not
know
he
thought
he
had
looked
at
them
only
a
few
moments
but
it
happened
that
in
the
portico
where
the
little
boy
sat
the
judges
of
the
high
court
were
assembled
to
help
folks
settle
their
differences
the
whole
portico
was
filled
with
people
who
complained
about
boundary
lines
that
had
been
moved
about
sheep
which
had
been
carried
away
from
the
flocks
and
branded
with
false
marks
about
debtors
who
wouldn
t
pay
among
them
came
a
rich
man
dressed
in
a
trailing
purple
robe
who
brought
before
the
court
a
poor
widow
who
was
supposed
to
owe
him
a
few
silver
shekels
the
poor
widow
cried
and
said
that
the
rich
man
dealt
unjustly
with
her
she
had
already
paid
her
debt
to
him
once
and
now
he
tried
to
force
her
to
pay
it
again
but
this
she
could
not
afford
to
do
she
was
so
poor
that
should
the
judges
condemn
her
to
pay
she
must
give
her
daughters
to
the
rich
man
as
slaves
then
he
who
sat
in
the
place
of
honor
on
the
judges
bench
turned
to
the
rich
man
and
said
do
you
dare
to
swear
on
oath
that
this
poor
woman
has
not
already
paid
you
then
the
rich
man
answered
lord
i
am
a
rich
man
would
i
take
the
trouble
to
demand
my
money
from
this
poor
widow
if
i
did
not
have
the
right
to
it
i
swear
to
you
that
as
certain
as
that
no
one
shall
ever
walk
through
righteousness
gate
does
this
woman
owe
me
the
sum
which
i
when
the
judges
heard
this
oath
they
believed
him
and
doomed
the
poor
widow
to
leave
him
her
daughters
as
slaves
but
the
little
boy
sat
close
by
and
heard
all
this
he
thought
to
himself
what
a
good
thing
it
would
be
if
some
one
could
squeeze
through
righteousness
gate
that
rich
man
certainly
did
not
speak
the
truth
it
is
a
great
pity
about
the
poor
old
woman
who
will
be
compelled
to
send
her
daughters
away
to
become
slaves
he
jumped
upon
the
platform
where
the
two
pillars
towered
into
the
heights
and
looked
through
the
crack
ah
that
it
were
not
altogether
impossible
thought
he
he
was
deeply
distressed
because
of
the
poor
woman
now
he
didn
t
think
at
all
about
the
saying
that
he
who
could
squeeze
through
righteousness
gate
was
holy
and
without
sin
he
wanted
to
get
through
only
for
the
sake
of
the
poor
woman
he
put
his
shoulder
in
the
groove
between
the
two
pillars
as
if
to
make
a
way
that
instant
all
the
people
who
stood
under
the
portico
looked
over
toward
righteousness
gate
for
it
rumbled
in
the
vaults
and
it
sang
in
the
old
pillars
and
they
glided
to
the
right
and
one
to
the
made
a
space
wide
enough
for
the
boy
s
slender
body
to
pass
between
them
then
there
arose
the
greatest
wonder
and
excitement
at
first
no
one
knew
what
to
say
the
people
stood
and
stared
at
the
little
boy
who
had
worked
so
great
a
miracle
the
oldest
among
the
judges
was
the
first
one
who
came
to
his
senses
he
called
out
that
they
should
lay
hold
on
the
rich
merchant
and
bring
him
before
the
judgment
seat
and
he
sentenced
him
to
leave
all
his
goods
to
the
poor
widow
because
he
had
sworn
falsely
in
god
s
temple
when
this
was
settled
the
judge
asked
after
the
boy
who
had
passed
through
righteousness
gate
but
when
the
people
looked
around
for
him
he
had
disappeared
for
the
very
moment
the
pillars
glided
apart
he
was
awakened
as
from
a
dream
and
remembered
the
and
his
parents
now
i
must
hasten
away
from
here
so
that
my
parents
will
not
have
to
wait
for
me
thought
he
he
knew
not
that
he
had
sat
a
whole
hour
before
righteousness
gate
but
believed
he
had
lingered
there
only
a
few
minutes
therefore
he
thought
that
he
would
even
have
time
to
take
a
look
at
paradise
bridge
before
he
left
the
temple
and
he
slipped
through
the
throng
of
people
and
came
to
paradise
bridge
which
was
situated
in
another
part
of
the
big
temple
but
when
he
saw
the
sharp
steel
sword
which
was
drawn
across
the
chasm
he
thought
how
the
person
who
could
walk
across
that
bridge
was
sure
of
reaching
paradise
he
believed
that
this
was
the
most
marvelous
thing
he
had
ever
beheld
and
he
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
chasm
to
look
at
the
steel
sword
there
he
sat
down
and
thought
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
reach
paradise
and
how
much
he
would
like
to
walk
across
the
bridge
but
at
the
same
time
he
saw
that
it
would
be
simply
impossible
even
to
attempt
it
thus
he
sat
and
mused
for
two
hours
but
he
did
not
know
how
the
time
had
flown
he
sat
there
and
thought
only
of
paradise
but
it
seems
that
in
the
court
where
the
deep
chasm
was
a
large
altar
had
been
erected
and
all
around
it
walked
priests
who
tended
the
altar
fire
and
received
sacrifices
in
the
court
there
were
many
with
offerings
and
a
big
crowd
who
only
watched
the
service
then
there
came
a
poor
old
man
who
brought
a
lamb
which
was
very
small
and
thin
and
which
had
been
bitten
by
a
dog
and
had
a
large
wound
the
man
went
up
to
the
priests
with
the
lamb
and
begged
that
he
might
offer
it
but
they
refused
to
accept
it
they
told
him
that
such
a
miserable
gift
he
could
not
offer
to
our
lord
the
old
man
implored
them
to
accept
the
lamb
out
of
compassion
for
his
son
lay
at
the
point
of
death
and
he
possessed
nothing
else
that
he
could
offer
to
god
for
his
restoration
you
must
let
me
offer
it
said
he
else
my
prayers
will
not
come
before
god
s
face
and
my
son
will
die
you
must
not
believe
but
that
i
have
the
greatest
sympathy
with
you
said
the
priest
but
in
the
law
it
is
forbidden
to
sacrifice
a
damaged
animal
it
is
just
as
impossible
to
grant
your
prayers
as
it
is
to
cross
paradise
the
little
boy
did
not
sit
very
far
away
so
he
heard
all
this
instantly
he
thought
what
a
pity
it
was
that
no
one
could
cross
the
bridge
perhaps
the
poor
man
might
keep
his
son
if
the
lamb
were
sacrificed
the
old
man
left
the
temple
court
disconsolate
but
the
boy
got
up
walked
over
to
the
trembling
bridge
and
put
his
foot
on
it
he
didn
t
think
at
all
about
wanting
to
cross
it
to
be
certain
of
paradise
his
thoughts
were
with
the
poor
man
whom
he
desired
to
help
but
he
drew
back
his
foot
for
he
thought
this
is
impossible
it
is
much
too
old
and
rusty
and
would
not
hold
even
me
but
once
again
his
thoughts
went
out
to
the
old
man
whose
son
lay
at
death
s
door
again
he
put
his
foot
down
upon
the
blade
then
he
noticed
that
it
ceased
to
tremble
and
that
beneath
his
foot
it
felt
broad
and
secure
and
when
he
took
the
next
step
upon
it
he
felt
that
the
air
around
him
supported
him
so
that
he
could
not
fall
it
bore
him
as
though
he
were
a
bird
and
had
wings
but
from
the
suspended
sword
a
sweet
tone
trembled
when
the
boy
walked
upon
it
and
one
of
those
who
stood
in
the
court
turned
around
when
he
heard
the
tone
he
gave
a
cry
and
then
the
others
turned
and
saw
the
little
boy
tripping
across
the
sword
there
was
great
consternation
among
all
who
stood
there
the
first
who
came
to
their
senses
were
the
priests
they
immediately
sent
a
messenger
after
the
poor
man
and
when
he
came
back
they
said
to
him
god
has
performed
a
miracle
to
show
us
that
he
will
accept
your
offering
give
us
your
lamb
and
we
will
sacrifice
when
this
was
done
they
asked
for
the
little
boy
who
had
walked
across
the
chasm
but
when
they
looked
around
for
him
they
could
not
find
him
for
just
after
the
boy
had
crossed
the
chasm
he
happened
to
think
of
the
journey
home
and
of
his
parents
he
did
not
know
that
the
morning
and
the
whole
forenoon
were
gone
but
thought
i
must
make
haste
and
get
back
so
that
they
will
not
have
to
wait
but
first
i
want
to
run
over
and
take
a
look
at
the
voice
of
the
prince
of
this
and
he
stole
away
through
the
crowd
and
ran
over
to
the
damp
where
the
copper
trumpet
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
when
he
saw
it
and
thought
about
the
prediction
that
he
who
could
coax
a
tone
from
it
should
one
day
gather
all
the
peoples
of
earth
under
his
dominion
he
fancied
that
never
had
he
seen
anything
so
wonderful
and
he
sat
down
beside
it
and
regarded
it
he
thought
how
great
it
would
be
to
win
all
the
peoples
of
earth
and
how
much
he
wished
that
he
could
blow
in
the
old
trumpet
but
he
understood
that
it
was
impossible
so
he
didn
t
even
dare
try
he
sat
like
this
for
several
hours
but
he
did
not
know
how
the
time
passed
he
thought
only
how
marvelous
it
would
be
to
gather
all
the
peoples
of
earth
under
his
dominion
but
it
happened
that
in
this
cool
passageway
sat
a
holy
man
who
instructed
his
pupils
that
sat
at
his
feet
and
now
this
holy
man
turned
toward
one
of
his
pupils
and
told
him
that
he
was
an
impostor
he
said
the
spirit
had
revealed
to
him
that
this
youth
was
a
stranger
and
not
an
israelite
and
he
demanded
why
he
had
sneaked
in
among
his
pupils
under
a
false
name
then
the
strange
youth
rose
and
said
that
he
had
wandered
through
deserts
and
sailed
over
great
seas
that
he
might
hear
wisdom
and
the
doctrine
of
the
only
true
god
expounded
my
soul
was
faint
with
longing
he
said
to
the
holy
man
but
i
knew
that
you
would
not
teach
me
if
i
did
not
say
that
i
was
an
israelite
therefore
i
lied
to
you
that
my
longing
should
be
satisfied
and
i
pray
that
you
will
let
me
remain
here
with
but
the
holy
man
stood
up
and
raised
his
arms
toward
heaven
it
is
just
as
impossible
to
let
you
remain
here
with
me
as
it
is
that
some
one
shall
arise
and
blow
in
the
huge
copper
trumpet
which
we
call
the
voice
of
the
prince
of
this
world
you
are
not
even
permitted
to
enter
this
part
of
the
temple
leave
this
place
at
once
or
my
pupils
will
throw
themselves
upon
you
and
tear
you
in
pieces
for
your
presence
desecrates
the
but
the
youth
stood
still
and
said
i
do
not
wish
to
go
elsewhere
where
my
soul
can
find
no
nourishment
i
would
rather
die
here
at
your
hardly
was
this
said
when
the
holy
man
s
pupils
jumped
to
their
feet
to
drive
him
away
and
when
he
made
resistance
they
threw
him
down
and
wished
to
kill
him
but
the
boy
sat
very
near
so
he
heard
and
saw
all
this
and
he
thought
this
is
a
great
injustice
oh
if
i
could
only
blow
in
the
big
copper
trumpet
he
would
be
he
rose
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
trumpet
at
this
moment
he
no
longer
wished
that
he
could
raise
it
to
his
lips
because
he
who
could
do
so
should
be
a
great
ruler
but
because
he
hoped
that
he
might
help
one
whose
life
was
in
danger
and
he
grasped
the
copper
trumpet
with
his
tiny
hands
to
try
and
lift
it
then
he
felt
that
the
huge
trumpet
raised
itself
to
his
lips
and
when
he
only
breathed
a
strong
resonant
tone
came
forth
from
the
trumpet
and
reverberated
all
through
the
great
temple
then
they
all
turned
their
eyes
and
saw
that
it
was
a
little
boy
who
stood
with
the
trumpet
to
his
lips
and
coaxed
from
it
tones
which
made
foundations
and
pillars
tremble
instantly
all
the
hands
which
had
been
lifted
to
strike
the
strange
youth
fell
and
the
holy
teacher
said
to
him
come
and
sit
thee
here
at
my
feet
as
thou
didst
sit
before
god
hath
performed
a
miracle
to
show
me
that
it
is
his
wish
that
thou
shouldst
be
consecrated
to
his
as
it
drew
on
toward
the
close
of
day
a
man
and
a
woman
came
hurrying
toward
jerusalem
they
looked
frightened
and
anxious
and
called
out
to
each
and
every
one
whom
they
met
we
have
lost
our
son
we
thought
he
had
followed
our
relatives
but
none
of
them
have
seen
him
has
any
one
of
you
passed
a
child
alone
those
who
came
from
jerusalem
answered
them
indeed
we
have
not
seen
your
son
but
in
the
temple
we
saw
a
most
beautiful
child
he
was
like
an
angel
from
heaven
and
he
has
passed
through
righteousness
they
would
gladly
have
related
very
minutely
all
about
this
but
the
parents
had
no
time
to
listen
when
they
had
walked
on
a
little
farther
they
met
other
persons
and
questioned
them
but
those
who
came
from
jerusalem
wished
to
talk
only
about
a
most
beautiful
child
who
looked
as
though
he
had
come
down
from
heaven
and
who
had
crossed
paradise
bridge
they
would
gladly
have
stopped
and
talked
about
this
until
late
at
night
but
the
man
and
woman
had
no
time
to
listen
to
them
and
hurried
into
the
city
they
walked
up
one
street
and
down
another
without
finding
the
child
at
last
they
reached
the
temple
as
they
came
up
to
it
the
woman
said
since
we
are
here
let
us
go
in
and
see
what
the
child
is
like
which
they
say
has
come
down
from
heaven
they
went
in
and
asked
where
they
should
find
the
child
go
straight
on
to
where
the
holy
teachers
sit
with
their
students
there
you
will
find
the
child
the
old
men
have
seated
him
in
their
midst
they
question
him
and
he
questions
them
and
they
are
all
amazed
at
him
but
all
the
people
stand
below
in
the
temple
court
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
one
who
has
raised
the
voice
of
the
prince
of
this
world
to
his
the
man
and
the
woman
made
their
way
through
the
throng
of
people
and
saw
that
the
child
who
sat
among
the
wise
teachers
was
their
son
but
as
soon
as
the
woman
recognized
the
child
she
began
to
weep
and
the
boy
who
sat
among
the
wise
men
heard
that
some
one
wept
and
he
knew
that
it
was
his
mother
then
he
rose
and
came
over
to
her
and
the
father
and
mother
took
him
between
them
and
went
from
the
temple
with
him
but
as
the
mother
continued
to
weep
the
child
asked
why
weepest
thou
i
came
to
thee
as
soon
as
i
heard
thy
should
i
not
weep
said
the
mother
i
believed
that
thou
wert
lost
to
they
went
out
from
the
city
and
darkness
came
on
and
all
the
while
the
mother
wept
why
weepest
thou
asked
the
child
i
did
not
know
that
the
day
was
spent
i
thought
it
was
still
morning
and
i
came
to
thee
as
soon
as
i
heard
thy
should
i
not
weep
said
the
mother
i
have
sought
for
thee
all
day
long
i
believed
that
thou
wert
lost
to
they
walked
the
whole
night
and
the
mother
wept
all
the
while
when
day
began
to
dawn
the
child
said
why
dost
thou
weep
i
have
not
sought
mine
own
glory
but
god
has
let
me
perform
miracles
because
he
wanted
to
help
the
three
poor
creatures
as
soon
as
i
heard
thy
voice
i
came
to
my
son
replied
the
mother
i
weep
because
thou
art
none
the
less
lost
to
me
thou
wilt
never
more
belong
to
me
henceforth
thy
life
ambition
shall
be
righteousness
thy
longing
paradise
and
thy
love
shall
embrace

beings

during
one
of
the
latter
years
of
emperor
tiberius
reign
a
poor
and
his
wife
came
and
settled
in
a
solitary
hut
among
the
sabine
mountains
they
were
strangers
and
lived
in
absolute
solitude
without
ever
receiving
a
visit
from
a
human
being
but
one
morning
when
the
laborer
opened
his
door
he
found
to
his
astonishment
that
an
old
woman
sat
huddled
up
on
the
threshold
she
was
wrapped
in
a
plain
gray
mantle
and
looked
very
poor
nevertheless
she
impressed
him
as
being
so
as
she
rose
and
came
to
meet
him
that
it
made
him
think
of
what
the
legends
had
to
say
about
goddesses
who
in
the
form
of
old
women
had
visited
mortals
my
friend
said
the
old
woman
to
the
you
must
not
wonder
that
i
have
slept
this
night
on
your
threshold
my
parents
lived
in
this
hut
and
here
i
was
born
nearly
ninety
years
ago
i
expected
to
find
it
empty
and
deserted
i
did
not
know
that
people
still
occupied
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
thought
a
hut
which
lies
so
high
up
among
these
desolate
hills
should
stand
empty
and
deserted
said
the
but
my
wife
and
i
come
from
a
foreign
land
and
as
poor
strangers
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
better
but
to
you
who
must
be
tired
and
hungry
after
the
long
journey
which
you
at
your
extreme
age
have
undertaken
it
is
perhaps
more
welcome
that
the
hut
is
occupied
by
people
than
by
sabine
mountain
wolves
you
will
at
least
find
a
bed
within
to
rest
on
and
a
bowl
of
goats
milk
and
a
if
you
will
accept
the
old
woman
smiled
a
little
but
this
smile
was
so
fleeting
that
it
could
not
dispel
the
expression
of
deep
sorrow
which
rested
upon
her
countenance
i
spent
my
entire
youth
up
here
among
these
mountains
she
said
i
have
not
yet
forgotten
the
trick
of
driving
a
wolf
from
his
and
she
actually
looked
so
strong
and
vigorous
that
the
laborer
didn
t
doubt
that
she
still
possessed
strength
enough
despite
her
great
age
to
fight
with
the
wild
beasts
of
the
forest
he
repeated
his
invitation
and
the
old
woman
stepped
into
the
cottage
she
sat
down
to
the
frugal
meal
and
partook
of
it
without
hesitancy
although
she
seemed
to
be
well
satisfied
with
the
fare
of
coarse
bread
soaked
in
goats
milk
both
the
man
and
his
wife
thought
where
can
this
old
wanderer
come
from
she
has
certainly
eaten
pheasants
served
on
silver
plates
oftener
than
she
has
drunk
goats
milk
from
earthen
now
and
then
she
raised
her
eyes
from
the
food
and
looked
around
if
to
try
and
realize
that
she
was
back
in
the
hut
the
poor
old
home
with
its
bare
clay
walls
and
its
earth
floor
was
certainly
not
much
changed
she
pointed
out
to
her
hosts
that
on
the
walls
there
were
still
visible
some
traces
of
dogs
and
deer
which
her
father
had
sketched
there
to
amuse
his
little
children
and
on
a
shelf
high
up
she
thought
she
saw
fragments
of
an
earthen
dish
which
she
herself
had
used
to
measure
milk
in
the
man
and
his
wife
thought
to
themselves
it
must
be
true
that
she
was
born
in
this
hut
but
she
has
surely
had
much
more
to
attend
to
in
this
life
than
milking
goats
and
making
butter
and
they
observed
also
that
her
thoughts
were
often
far
away
and
that
she
sighed
heavily
and
anxiously
every
time
she
came
back
to
herself
finally
she
rose
from
the
table
she
thanked
them
graciously
for
the
hospitality
she
had
enjoyed
and
walked
toward
the
door
but
then
it
seemed
to
the
that
she
was
pitifully
poor
and
lonely
and
he
exclaimed
if
i
am
not
mistaken
it
was
not
your
intention
when
you
dragged
yourself
up
here
last
night
to
leave
this
hut
so
soon
if
you
are
actually
as
poor
as
you
seem
it
must
have
been
your
intention
to
remain
here
for
the
rest
of
your
life
but
now
you
wish
to
leave
because
my
wife
and
i
have
taken
possession
of
the
the
old
woman
did
not
deny
that
he
had
guessed
rightly
but
this
hut
which
for
many
years
has
been
deserted
belongs
to
you
as
much
as
to
me
she
said
i
have
no
right
to
drive
you
from
it
is
still
your
parents
hut
said
the
laborer
and
you
surely
have
a
better
right
to
it
than
we
have
besides
we
are
young
and
you
are
old
therefore
you
shall
remain
and
we
will
when
the
old
woman
heard
this
she
was
greatly
astonished
she
turned
around
on
the
threshold
and
stared
at
the
man
as
though
she
had
not
understood
what
he
meant
by
his
words
but
now
the
young
wife
joined
in
the
conversation
if
i
might
suggest
said
she
to
her
husband
i
should
beg
you
to
ask
this
old
woman
if
she
won
t
look
upon
us
as
her
own
children
and
permit
us
to
stay
with
her
and
take
care
of
her
what
service
would
we
render
her
if
we
gave
her
this
miserable
hut
and
then
left
her
it
would
be
terrible
for
her
to
live
here
in
this
wilderness
alone
and
what
would
she
live
on
it
would
be
just
like
letting
her
starve
to
the
old
woman
went
up
to
the
man
and
his
wife
and
regarded
them
carefully
why
do
you
speak
thus
she
asked
why
are
you
so
merciful
to
me
you
are
then
the
young
wife
answered
it
is
because
we
ourselves
once
met
with
great
ii
this
is
how
the
old
woman
came
to
live
in
the
s
hut
and
she
conceived
a
great
friendship
for
the
young
people
but
for
all
that
she
never
told
them
whence
she
had
come
or
who
she
was
and
they
understood
that
she
would
not
have
taken
it
in
good
part
had
they
questioned
her
but
one
evening
when
the
day
s
work
was
done
and
all
three
sat
on
the
big
flat
rock
which
lay
before
the
entrance
and
partook
of
their
evening
meal
they
saw
an
old
man
coming
up
the
path
he
was
a
tall
and
powerfully
built
man
with
shoulders
as
broad
as
a
gladiator
s
his
face
wore
a
cheerless
and
stern
expression
the
brows
jutted
far
out
over
the
eyes
and
the
lines
around
the
mouth
expressed
bitterness
and
contempt
he
walked
with
erect
bearing
and
quick
movements
the
man
wore
a
simple
dress
and
the
instant
the
saw
him
he
said
he
is
an
old
soldier
one
who
has
been
discharged
from
service
and
is
now
on
his
way
when
the
stranger
came
directly
before
them
he
paused
as
if
in
doubt
the
laborer
who
knew
that
the
road
terminated
a
short
distance
beyond
the
hut
laid
down
his
spoon
and
called
out
to
him
have
you
gone
astray
stranger
since
you
come
hither
usually
no
one
takes
the
trouble
to
climb
up
here
unless
he
has
an
errand
to
one
of
us
who
live
when
he
questioned
in
this
manner
the
stranger
came
nearer
it
is
as
you
say
said
he
i
have
taken
the
wrong
road
and
now
i
know
not
whither
i
shall
direct
my
steps
if
you
will
let
me
rest
here
a
while
and
then
tell
me
which
path
i
shall
follow
to
get
to
some
farm
i
shall
be
grateful
to
as
he
spake
he
sat
down
upon
one
of
the
stones
which
lay
before
the
hut
the
young
woman
asked
him
if
he
wouldn
t
share
their
supper
but
this
he
declined
with
a
smile
on
the
other
hand
it
was
very
evident
that
he
was
inclined
to
talk
with
them
while
they
ate
he
asked
the
young
folks
about
their
manner
of
living
and
their
work
and
they
answered
him
frankly
and
cheerfully
suddenly
the
laborer
turned
toward
the
stranger
and
began
to
question
him
you
see
in
what
a
lonely
and
isolated
way
we
live
said
he
it
must
be
a
year
at
least
since
i
have
talked
with
any
one
except
shepherds
and
vineyard
laborers
can
not
you
who
must
come
from
some
camp
tell
us
something
about
rome
and
the
emperor
hardly
had
the
man
said
this
than
the
young
wife
noticed
that
the
old
woman
gave
him
a
warning
glance
and
made
with
her
hand
the
sign
which
a
care
what
you
say
the
stranger
meanwhile
answered
very
affably
i
understand
that
you
take
me
for
a
soldier
which
is
not
untrue
although
i
have
long
since
left
the
service
during
tiberius
reign
there
has
not
been
much
work
for
us
soldiers
yet
he
was
once
a
great
commander
those
were
the
days
of
his
good
fortune
now
he
thinks
of
nothing
except
to
guard
himself
against
conspiracies
in
rome
every
one
is
talking
about
how
last
week
he
let
senator
titius
be
seized
and
executed
on
the
merest
the
poor
emperor
no
longer
knows
what
he
does
exclaimed
the
young
woman
and
shook
her
head
in
pity
and
surprise
you
are
perfectly
right
said
the
stranger
as
an
expression
of
the
deepest
melancholy
crossed
his
countenance
tiberius
knows
that
every
one
hates
him
and
this
is
driving
him
what
say
you
the
woman
retorted
why
should
we
hate
him
we
only
deplore
the
fact
that
he
is
no
longer
the
great
emperor
he
was
in
the
beginning
of
his
you
are
mistaken
said
the
stranger
every
one
hates
and
detests
tiberius
why
should
they
do
otherwise
he
is
nothing
but
a
cruel
and
merciless
tyrant
in
rome
they
think
that
from
now
on
he
will
become
even
more
unreasonable
than
he
has
has
anything
happened
then
which
will
turn
him
into
a
worse
beast
than
he
is
already
queried
the
when
he
said
this
the
wife
noticed
that
the
old
woman
gave
him
a
new
warning
signal
but
so
stealthily
that
he
could
not
see
it
the
stranger
answered
him
in
a
kindly
manner
but
at
the
same
time
a
singular
smile
played
about
his
lips
you
have
heard
perhaps
that
until
now
tiberius
has
had
a
friend
in
his
household
on
whom
he
could
rely
and
who
has
always
told
him
the
truth
all
the
rest
who
live
in
his
palace
are
and
hypocrites
who
praise
the
emperor
s
wicked
and
cunning
acts
just
as
much
as
his
good
and
admirable
ones
but
there
was
as
we
have
said
one
alone
who
never
feared
to
let
him
know
how
his
conduct
was
actually
regarded
this
person
who
was
more
courageous
than
senators
and
generals
was
the
emperor
s
old
nurse
i
have
heard
of
her
said
the
laborer
i
ve
been
told
that
the
emperor
has
always
shown
her
great
yes
tiberius
knew
how
to
prize
her
affection
and
loyalty
he
treated
this
poor
peasant
woman
who
came
from
a
miserable
hut
in
the
sabine
mountains
as
his
second
mother
as
long
as
he
stayed
in
rome
he
let
her
live
in
a
mansion
on
the
palatine
that
he
might
always
have
her
near
him
none
of
rome
s
noble
matrons
has
fared
better
than
she
she
was
borne
through
the
streets
in
a
litter
and
her
dress
was
that
of
an
empress
when
the
emperor
moved
to
capri
she
had
to
accompany
him
and
he
bought
a
country
estate
for
her
there
and
filled
it
with
slaves
and
costly
she
has
certainly
fared
well
said
the
husband
now
it
was
he
who
kept
up
the
conversation
with
the
stranger
the
wife
sat
silent
and
observed
with
surprise
the
change
which
had
come
over
the
old
woman
since
the
stranger
arrived
she
had
not
spoken
a
word
she
had
lost
her
mild
and
friendly
expression
she
had
pushed
her
food
aside
and
sat
erect
and
rigid
against
the
and
stared
straight
ahead
with
a
severe
and
stony
countenance
it
was
the
emperor
s
intention
that
she
should
have
a
happy
life
said
the
stranger
but
despite
all
his
kindly
acts
she
too
has
deserted
the
old
woman
gave
a
start
at
these
words
but
the
young
one
laid
her
hand
quietingly
on
her
arm
then
she
began
to
speak
in
her
soft
sympathetic
voice
i
can
not
believe
that
faustina
has
been
as
happy
at
court
as
you
say
she
said
as
she
turned
toward
the
stranger
i
am
sure
that
she
has
loved
tiberius
as
if
he
had
been
her
own
son
i
can
understand
how
proud
she
has
been
of
his
noble
youth
and
i
can
even
understand
how
it
must
have
grieved
her
to
see
him
abandon
himself
in
his
old
age
to
suspicion
and
cruelty
she
has
certainly
warned
and
admonished
him
every
day
it
has
been
terrible
for
her
always
to
plead
in
vain
at
last
she
could
no
longer
bear
to
see
him
sink
lower
and
the
stranger
astonished
leaned
forward
a
bit
when
he
heard
this
but
the
young
woman
did
not
glance
up
at
him
she
kept
her
eyes
lowered
and
spoke
very
calmly
and
gently
perhaps
you
are
right
in
what
you
say
of
the
old
woman
he
replied
faustina
has
really
not
been
happy
at
court
it
seems
strange
nevertheless
that
she
has
left
the
emperor
in
his
old
age
when
she
had
endured
him
the
span
of
a
what
say
you
asked
the
husband
has
old
faustina
left
the
emperor
she
has
stolen
away
from
capri
without
any
one
s
knowledge
said
the
stranger
she
left
just
as
poor
as
she
came
she
has
not
taken
one
of
her
treasures
with
and
doesn
t
the
emperor
really
know
where
she
has
gone
asked
the
wife
no
no
one
knows
for
certain
what
road
the
old
woman
has
taken
still
one
takes
it
for
granted
that
she
has
sought
refuge
among
her
native
and
the
emperor
does
not
know
either
why
she
has
gone
away
asked
the
young
woman
no
the
emperor
knows
nothing
of
this
he
can
not
believe
she
left
him
because
he
once
told
her
that
she
served
him
for
money
and
gifts
only
like
all
the
rest
she
knows
however
that
he
has
never
doubted
her
unselfishness
he
has
hoped
all
along
that
she
would
return
to
him
voluntarily
for
no
one
knows
better
than
she
that
he
is
absolutely
without
i
do
not
know
her
said
the
young
woman
but
i
think
i
can
tell
you
why
she
has
left
the
emperor
the
old
woman
was
brought
up
among
these
mountains
in
simplicity
and
piety
and
she
has
always
longed
to
come
back
here
again
surely
she
never
would
have
abandoned
the
emperor
if
he
had
not
insulted
her
but
i
understand
that
after
this
she
feels
she
has
the
right
to
think
of
herself
since
her
days
are
numbered
if
i
were
a
poor
woman
of
the
mountains
i
certainly
would
have
acted
as
she
did
i
would
have
thought
that
i
had
done
enough
when
i
had
served
my
master
during
a
whole
lifetime
i
would
at
last
have
abandoned
luxury
and
royal
favors
to
give
my
soul
a
taste
of
honor
and
integrity
before
it
left
me
for
the
long
the
stranger
glanced
with
a
deep
and
tender
sadness
at
the
young
woman
you
do
not
consider
that
the
emperor
s
propensities
will
become
worse
than
ever
now
there
is
no
one
who
can
calm
him
when
suspicion
and
misanthropy
take
possession
of
him
think
of
this
he
continued
as
his
melancholy
gaze
penetrated
deeply
into
the
eyes
of
the
young
woman
in
all
the
world
there
is
no
one
now
whom
he
does
not
hate
no
one
whom
he
does
not
one
as
he
uttered
these
words
of
bitter
despair
the
old
woman
made
a
sudden
movement
and
turned
toward
him
but
the
young
woman
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
and
answered
tiberius
knows
that
faustina
will
come
back
to
him
whenever
he
wishes
it
but
first
she
must
know
that
her
old
eyes
need
never
more
behold
vice
and
infamy
at
his
they
had
all
risen
during
this
speech
but
the
and
his
wife
placed
themselves
in
front
of
the
old
woman
as
if
to
shield
her
the
stranger
did
not
utter
another
syllable
but
regarded
the
old
woman
with
a
questioning
glance
is
this
last
word
also
he
seemed
to
want
to
say
the
old
woman
s
lips
quivered
but
words
would
not
pass
them
if
the
emperor
has
loved
his
old
servant
then
he
can
also
let
her
live
her
last
days
in
peace
said
the
young
woman
the
stranger
hesitated
still
but
suddenly
his
dark
countenance
brightened
my
friends
said
he
whatever
one
may
say
of
tiberius
there
is
one
thing
which
he
has
learned
better
than
others
and
that
i
have
only
one
thing
more
to
say
to
you
if
this
old
woman
of
whom
we
have
spoken
should
come
to
this
hut
receive
her
well
the
emperor
s
favor
rests
upon
any
one
who
succors
he
wrapped
his
mantle
about
him
and
departed
the
same
way
that
he
had
come
iii
after
this
the
and
his
wife
never
again
spoke
to
the
old
woman
about
the
emperor
between
themselves
they
marveled
that
she
at
her
great
age
had
had
the
strength
to
renounce
all
the
wealth
and
power
to
which
she
had
become
accustomed
i
wonder
if
she
will
not
soon
go
back
to
tiberius
they
asked
themselves
it
is
certain
that
she
still
loves
him
it
is
in
the
hope
that
it
will
awaken
him
to
reason
and
enable
him
to
repent
of
his
low
conduct
that
she
has
left
a
man
as
old
as
the
emperor
will
never
begin
a
new
life
said
the
laborer
how
are
you
going
to
rid
him
of
his
great
contempt
for
mankind
who
could
go
to
him
and
teach
him
to
love
his
fellow
man
until
this
happens
he
can
not
be
cured
of
suspicion
and
you
know
that
there
is
one
who
could
actually
do
it
said
the
wife
i
often
think
of
how
it
would
turn
out
if
the
two
should
meet
but
god
s
ways
are
not
our
the
old
woman
did
not
seem
to
miss
her
former
life
at
all
after
a
time
the
young
wife
gave
birth
to
a
child
the
old
woman
had
the
care
of
it
she
seemed
so
content
in
consequence
that
one
could
have
thought
she
had
forgotten
all
her
sorrows
once
every
she
used
to
wrap
her
long
gray
mantle
around
her
and
wander
down
to
rome
there
she
did
not
seek
a
soul
but
went
straight
to
the
forum
here
she
stopped
outside
a
little
temple
which
was
erected
on
one
side
of
the
superbly
decorated
square
all
there
was
of
this
temple
was
an
uncommonly
large
altar
which
stood
in
a
court
under
the
open
sky
on
the
top
of
the
altar
fortuna
the
goddess
of
happiness
was
enthroned
and
at
its
foot
was
a
statue
of
tiberius
encircling
the
court
were
buildings
for
the
priests
storerooms
for
fuel
and
stalls
for
the
beasts
of
sacrifice
old
faustina
s
journeys
never
extended
beyond
this
temple
where
those
who
would
pray
for
the
welfare
of
tiberius
were
wont
to
come
when
she
cast
a
glance
in
there
and
saw
that
both
the
goddess
and
the
emperor
s
statue
were
wreathed
in
flowers
that
the
sacrificial
fire
burned
that
throngs
of
reverent
worshipers
were
assembled
before
the
altar
and
heard
the
priests
low
chants
sounding
thereabouts
she
turned
around
and
went
back
to
the
mountains
in
this
way
she
learned
without
having
to
question
a
human
being
that
tiberius
was
still
among
the
living
and
that
all
was
well
with
him
the
third
time
she
undertook
this
journey
she
met
with
a
surprise
when
she
reached
the
little
temple
she
found
it
empty
and
deserted
no
fire
burned
before
the
statue
and
not
a
worshiper
was
seen
a
couple
of
dried
garlands
still
hung
on
one
side
of
the
altar
but
this
was
all
that
testified
to
its
former
glory
the
priests
were
gone
and
the
emperor
s
statue
which
stood
there
unguarded
was
damaged
and
the
old
woman
turned
to
the
first
what
does
this
mean
she
asked
is
tiberius
dead
have
we
another
emperor
no
replied
the
roman
tiberius
is
still
emperor
but
we
have
ceased
to
pray
for
him
our
prayers
can
no
longer
benefit
my
friend
said
the
old
woman
i
live
far
away
among
the
mountains
where
one
learns
nothing
of
what
happens
out
in
the
world
won
t
you
tell
me
what
dreadful
misfortune
has
overtaken
the
emperor
the
most
dreadful
of
all
misfortunes
he
has
been
stricken
with
a
disease
which
has
never
before
been
known
in
italy
but
which
seems
to
be
common
in
the
orient
since
this
evil
has
befallen
the
emperor
his
features
are
changed
his
voice
has
become
like
an
animal
s
grunt
and
his
toes
and
fingers
are
rotting
away
and
for
this
illness
there
appears
to
be
no
remedy
they
believe
that
he
will
die
within
a
few
weeks
but
if
he
does
not
die
he
will
be
dethroned
for
such
an
ill
and
wretched
man
can
no
longer
conduct
the
affairs
of
state
you
understand
of
course
that
his
fate
is
a
foregone
conclusion
it
is
useless
to
invoke
the
gods
for
his
success
and
it
is
not
worth
while
he
added
with
a
faint
smile
no
one
has
anything
more
either
to
fear
or
hope
from
him
why
then
should
we
trouble
ourselves
on
his
account
he
nodded
and
walked
away
but
the
old
woman
stood
there
as
if
stunned
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
collapsed
and
looked
like
one
whom
age
has
subdued
she
stood
with
bent
back
and
trembling
head
and
with
hands
that
groped
feebly
in
the
air
she
longed
to
get
away
from
the
place
but
she
moved
her
feet
slowly
she
looked
around
to
find
something
which
she
could
use
as
a
staff
but
after
a
few
moments
by
a
tremendous
effort
of
the
will
she
succeeded
in
conquering
the
faintness
iv
a
week
later
old
faustina
wandered
up
the
steep
inclines
on
the
island
of
capri
it
was
a
warm
day
and
the
dread
consciousness
of
old
age
and
feebleness
came
over
her
as
she
labored
up
the
winding
roads
and
the
steps
in
the
mountain
which
led
to
tiberius
villa
this
feeling
increased
when
she
observed
how
changed
everything
had
become
during
the
time
she
had
been
away
in
truth
on
and
alongside
these
steps
there
had
always
before
been
throngs
of
people
here
it
used
fairly
to
swarm
with
senators
borne
by
giant
libyans
with
messengers
from
the
provinces
attended
by
long
processions
of
slaves
with
with
noblemen
invited
to
participate
in
the
emperor
s
feasts
but
the
steps
and
passages
were
entirely
deserted
lizards
were
the
only
living
things
which
the
old
woman
saw
in
her
path
she
was
amazed
to
see
that
already
everything
appeared
to
be
going
to
ruin
at
most
the
emperor
s
illness
could
not
have
progressed
more
than
two
months
and
yet
the
grass
had
already
taken
root
in
the
cracks
between
the
marble
stones
rare
growths
planted
in
beautiful
vases
were
already
withered
and
here
and
there
mischievous
spoilers
whom
no
one
had
taken
the
trouble
to
stop
had
broken
down
the
balustrade
but
to
her
the
most
singular
thing
of
all
was
the
entire
absence
of
people
even
if
strangers
were
forbidden
to
appear
on
the
island
attendants
at
least
should
still
be
found
there
the
endless
crowds
of
soldiers
and
slaves
of
dancers
and
musicians
of
cooks
and
stewards
of
and
gardeners
who
belonged
to
the
emperor
s
household
when
faustina
reached
the
upper
terrace
she
caught
sight
of
two
slaves
who
sat
on
the
steps
in
front
of
the
villa
as
she
approached
they
rose
and
bowed
to
her
be
greeted
faustina
said
one
of
them
it
is
a
god
who
sends
thee
to
lighten
our
what
does
this
mean
milo
asked
faustina
why
is
it
so
deserted
here
yet
they
have
told
me
that
tiberius
still
lives
at
the
emperor
has
driven
away
all
his
slaves
because
he
suspects
that
one
of
us
has
given
him
poisoned
wine
to
drink
and
that
this
has
brought
on
the
illness
he
would
have
driven
even
tito
and
myself
away
if
we
had
not
refused
to
obey
him
yet
as
you
know
we
have
all
our
lives
served
the
emperor
and
his
i
do
not
ask
after
slaves
only
said
faustina
where
are
the
senators
and
field
marshals
where
are
the
emperor
s
intimate
friends
and
all
the
fawning
tiberius
does
not
wish
to
show
himself
before
strangers
said
the
slave
senator
lucius
and
marco
commander
of
the
life
guard
come
here
every
day
and
receive
orders
no
one
else
may
approach
faustina
had
gone
up
the
steps
to
enter
the
villa
the
slave
went
before
her
and
on
the
way
she
asked
what
say
the
physicians
of
tiberius
illness
none
of
them
understands
how
to
treat
this
illness
they
do
not
even
know
if
it
kills
quickly
or
slowly
but
this
i
can
tell
you
faustina
tiberius
must
die
if
he
continues
to
refuse
all
food
for
fear
it
may
be
poisoned
and
i
know
that
a
sick
man
can
not
stay
awake
night
and
day
as
the
emperor
does
for
fear
he
may
be
murdered
in
his
sleep
if
he
will
trust
you
as
in
former
days
you
might
succeed
in
making
him
eat
and
sleep
thereby
you
can
prolong
his
life
for
many
the
slave
conducted
faustina
through
several
passages
and
courts
to
a
terrace
which
tiberius
used
to
frequent
to
enjoy
the
view
of
the
beautiful
bays
and
proud
vesuvius
when
faustina
stepped
out
upon
the
terrace
she
saw
a
hideous
creature
with
a
swollen
face
and
features
his
hands
and
feet
were
swathed
in
white
bandages
but
through
the
bandages
protruded
fingers
and
toes
and
this
being
s
clothes
were
soiled
and
dusty
it
was
evident
he
could
not
walk
erect
but
had
been
obliged
to
crawl
out
upon
the
terrace
he
lay
with
closed
eyes
near
the
balustrade
at
the
farthest
end
and
did
not
move
when
the
slave
and
faustina
came
faustina
whispered
to
the
slave
who
walked
before
her
but
milo
how
can
such
a
creature
be
found
here
on
the
emperor
s
private
terrace
make
haste
and
take
him
away
but
she
had
scarcely
said
this
when
she
saw
the
slave
bow
to
the
ground
before
the
miserable
creature
who
lay
there
cæsar
tiberius
said
he
at
last
i
have
glad
tidings
to
bring
at
the
same
time
the
slave
turned
toward
faustina
but
he
shrank
back
aghast
and
could
not
speak
another
word
he
did
not
behold
the
proud
matron
who
had
looked
so
strong
that
one
might
have
expected
that
she
would
live
to
the
age
of
a
sibyl
in
this
moment
she
had
drooped
into
impotent
age
and
the
slave
saw
before
him
a
bent
old
woman
with
misty
eyes
and
fumbling
hands
faustina
had
certainly
heard
that
the
emperor
was
terribly
changed
yet
never
for
a
moment
had
she
ceased
to
think
of
him
as
the
strong
man
he
was
when
she
last
saw
him
she
had
also
heard
some
one
say
that
this
illness
progressed
slowly
and
that
it
took
years
to
transform
a
human
being
but
here
it
had
advanced
with
such
virulence
that
it
had
made
the
emperor
unrecognizable
in
just
two
months
she
tottered
up
to
the
emperor
she
could
not
speak
but
stood
silent
beside
him
and
wept
are
you
come
now
faustina
he
said
without
opening
his
eyes
i
lay
and
fancied
that
you
stood
here
and
wept
over
me
i
dare
not
look
up
for
fear
i
will
find
that
it
was
only
an
then
the
old
woman
sat
down
beside
him
she
raised
his
head
and
placed
it
on
her
knee
but
tiberius
lay
still
without
looking
at
her
a
sense
of
sweet
repose
enfolded
him
and
the
next
moment
he
sank
into
a
peaceful
slumber
v
a
few
weeks
later
one
of
the
emperor
s
slaves
came
to
the
lonely
hut
in
the
sabine
mountains
it
drew
on
toward
evening
and
the
and
his
wife
stood
in
the
doorway
and
saw
the
sun
set
in
the
distant
west
the
slave
turned
out
of
the
path
and
came
up
and
greeted
them
thereupon
he
took
a
heavy
purse
which
he
carried
in
his
girdle
and
laid
it
in
the
husband
s
hand
this
faustina
the
old
woman
to
whom
you
have
shown
compassion
sends
you
said
the
slave
she
begs
that
with
this
money
you
will
purchase
a
vineyard
of
your
own
and
build
you
a
house
that
does
not
lie
as
high
in
the
air
as
the
eagles
old
faustina
still
lives
then
said
the
husband
we
have
searched
for
her
in
cleft
and
morass
when
she
did
not
come
back
to
us
i
thought
that
she
had
met
her
death
in
these
wretched
don
t
you
remember
the
wife
interposed
that
i
would
not
believe
that
she
was
dead
did
i
not
say
to
you
that
she
had
gone
back
to
the
emperor
this
the
husband
admitted
and
i
am
glad
he
added
that
you
were
right
not
only
because
faustina
has
become
rich
enough
to
help
us
out
of
our
poverty
but
also
on
the
poor
emperor
s
the
slave
wanted
to
say
farewell
at
once
in
order
to
reach
densely
settled
quarters
before
dark
but
this
the
couple
would
not
permit
you
must
stop
with
us
until
morning
said
they
we
can
not
let
you
go
before
you
have
told
us
all
that
has
happened
to
faustina
why
has
she
returned
to
the
emperor
what
was
their
meeting
like
are
they
glad
to
be
together
again
the
slave
yielded
to
these
solicitations
he
followed
them
into
the
hut
and
during
the
evening
meal
he
told
them
all
about
the
emperor
s
illness
and
faustina
s
return
when
the
slave
had
finished
his
narrative
he
saw
that
both
the
man
and
the
woman
sat
with
amazement
their
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
ground
as
though
not
to
betray
the
emotion
which
affected
them
finally
the
man
looked
up
and
said
to
his
wife
don
t
you
believe
god
has
decreed
this
yes
said
the
wife
surely
it
was
for
this
that
our
lord
sent
us
across
the
sea
to
this
lonely
hut
surely
this
was
his
purpose
when
he
sent
the
old
woman
to
our
as
soon
as
the
wife
had
spoken
these
words
the
turned
again
to
the
slave
friend
he
said
to
him
you
shall
carry
a
message
from
me
to
faustina
tell
her
this
word
for
word
thus
your
friend
the
vineyard
laborer
from
the
sabine
mountains
greets
you
you
have
seen
the
young
woman
my
wife
did
she
not
appear
fair
to
you
and
blooming
with
health
and
yet
this
young
woman
once
suffered
from
the
same
disease
which
now
has
stricken
the
slave
made
a
gesture
of
surprise
but
the
continued
with
greater
emphasis
on
his
words
if
faustina
refuses
to
believe
my
word
tell
her
that
my
wife
and
i
came
from
palestine
in
asia
a
land
where
this
disease
is
common
there
the
law
is
such
that
the
lepers
are
driven
from
the
cities
and
towns
and
must
live
in
tombs
and
mountain
grottoes
tell
faustina
that
my
wife
was
born
of
diseased
parents
in
a
mountain
grotto
as
long
as
she
was
a
child
she
was
healthy
but
when
she
grew
up
into
young
maidenhood
she
was
stricken
with
the
the
slave
bowed
smiled
pleasantly
and
said
how
can
you
expect
that
faustina
will
believe
this
she
has
seen
your
wife
in
her
beauty
and
health
and
she
must
know
that
there
is
no
remedy
for
this
the
man
replied
it
were
best
for
her
that
she
believed
me
but
i
am
not
without
witnesses
she
can
send
inquiries
over
to
nazareth
in
galilee
there
every
one
will
confirm
my
is
it
perchance
through
a
miracle
of
some
god
that
your
wife
has
been
cured
asked
the
slave
yes
it
is
as
you
say
answered
the
laborer
one
day
a
rumor
reached
the
sick
who
lived
in
the
wilderness
behold
a
great
prophet
has
arisen
in
nazareth
of
galilee
he
is
filled
with
the
power
of
god
s
spirit
and
he
can
cure
your
illness
just
by
laying
his
hand
upon
your
forehead
but
the
sick
who
lay
in
their
misery
would
not
believe
that
this
rumor
was
the
truth
no
one
can
heal
us
they
said
since
the
days
of
the
great
prophets
no
one
has
been
able
to
save
one
of
us
from
this
but
there
was
one
amongst
them
who
believed
and
that
was
a
young
maiden
she
left
the
others
to
seek
her
way
to
the
city
of
nazareth
where
the
prophet
lived
one
day
when
she
wandered
over
wide
plains
she
met
a
man
tall
of
stature
with
a
pale
face
and
hair
which
lay
in
even
black
curls
his
dark
eyes
shone
like
stars
and
drew
her
toward
him
but
before
they
met
she
called
out
to
him
come
not
near
me
for
i
am
unclean
but
tell
me
where
i
can
find
the
prophet
from
nazareth
but
the
man
continued
to
walk
towards
her
and
when
he
stood
directly
in
front
of
her
he
said
why
seekest
thou
the
prophet
of
nazareth
i
seek
him
that
he
may
lay
his
hand
on
my
forehead
and
heal
me
of
my
then
the
man
went
up
and
laid
his
hand
upon
her
brow
but
she
said
to
him
what
doth
it
avail
me
that
you
lay
your
hand
upon
my
forehead
you
surely
are
no
prophet
then
he
smiled
on
her
and
said
go
now
into
the
city
which
lies
yonder
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
show
thyself
before
the
priests
the
sick
maiden
thought
to
herself
he
mocks
me
because
i
believe
i
can
be
healed
from
him
i
can
not
learn
what
i
would
and
she
went
farther
soon
thereafter
she
saw
a
man
who
was
going
out
to
hunt
riding
across
the
wide
field
when
he
came
so
near
that
he
could
hear
her
she
called
to
him
come
not
close
to
me
i
am
unclean
but
tell
me
where
i
can
find
the
prophet
of
nazareth
what
do
you
want
of
the
prophet
asked
the
man
riding
slowly
toward
her
i
wish
only
that
he
might
lay
his
hand
on
my
forehead
and
heal
me
of
my
the
man
rode
still
nearer
of
what
illness
do
you
wish
to
be
healed
said
he
surely
you
need
no
physician
can
t
you
see
that
i
am
a
leper
said
she
i
was
born
of
diseased
parents
in
a
mountain
but
the
man
continued
to
approach
for
she
was
beautiful
and
fair
like
a
rose
you
are
the
most
beautiful
maiden
in
judea
he
exclaimed
ah
taunt
me
too
said
she
i
know
that
my
features
are
destroyed
and
that
my
voice
is
like
a
wild
beast
s
he
looked
deep
into
her
eyes
and
said
to
her
your
voice
is
as
resonant
as
the
spring
brook
s
when
it
ripples
over
pebbles
and
your
face
is
as
smooth
as
a
coverlet
of
soft
that
moment
he
rode
so
close
to
her
that
she
could
see
her
face
in
the
shining
mountings
which
decorated
his
saddle
you
shall
look
at
yourself
here
said
he
she
did
so
and
saw
a
face
smooth
and
soft
as
a
butterfly
wing
what
is
this
that
i
see
she
said
this
is
not
my
face
yes
it
is
your
face
said
the
rider
but
my
voice
is
it
not
rough
does
it
not
sound
as
when
wagons
are
drawn
over
a
stony
road
no
it
sounds
like
a
zither
player
s
sweetest
songs
said
the
rider
she
turned
and
pointed
toward
the
road
do
you
know
who
that
man
is
just
disappearing
behind
the
two
oaks
she
asked
it
is
he
whom
you
lately
asked
after
it
is
the
prophet
from
nazareth
said
the
man
then
she
clasped
her
hands
in
astonishment
and
tears
filled
her
eyes
oh
thou
holy
one
oh
thou
messenger
of
god
s
power
she
cried
thou
hast
healed
me
then
the
rider
lifted
her
into
the
saddle
and
bore
her
to
the
city
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
went
with
her
to
the
priests
and
elders
and
told
them
how
he
had
found
her
they
questioned
her
carefully
but
when
they
heard
that
the
maiden
was
born
in
the
wilderness
of
diseased
parents
they
would
not
believe
that
she
was
healed
go
back
thither
whence
you
came
said
they
if
you
have
been
ill
you
must
remain
so
as
long
as
you
live
you
must
not
come
here
to
the
city
to
infect
the
rest
of
us
with
your
she
said
to
them
i
know
that
i
am
well
for
the
prophet
from
nazareth
hath
laid
his
hand
upon
my
when
they
heard
this
they
exclaimed
who
is
he
that
he
should
be
able
to
make
clean
the
unclean
all
this
is
but
a
delusion
of
the
evil
spirits
go
back
to
your
own
that
you
may
not
bring
destruction
upon
all
of
us
they
would
not
declare
her
healed
and
they
forbade
her
to
remain
in
the
city
they
decreed
that
each
and
every
one
who
gave
her
shelter
should
also
be
adjudged
unclean
when
the
priests
had
pronounced
this
judgment
the
young
maiden
turned
to
the
man
who
had
found
her
in
the
field
whither
shall
i
go
now
must
i
go
back
again
to
the
lepers
in
the
wilderness
but
the
man
lifted
her
once
more
upon
his
horse
and
said
to
her
no
under
no
conditions
shall
you
go
out
to
the
lepers
in
their
mountain
caves
but
we
two
shall
travel
across
the
sea
to
another
land
where
there
are
no
laws
for
clean
and
and
but
when
the
vineyard
laborer
had
got
thus
far
in
his
narrative
the
slave
arose
and
interrupted
him
you
need
not
tell
any
more
said
he
stand
up
rather
and
follow
me
on
the
way
you
who
know
the
mountains
so
that
i
can
begin
my
home
journey
and
not
wait
until
morning
the
emperor
and
faustina
can
not
hear
your
tidings
a
moment
too
when
the
had
accompanied
the
slave
and
come
home
again
to
the
hut
he
found
his
wife
still
awake
i
can
not
sleep
said
she
i
am
thinking
that
these
two
will
meet
he
who
loves
all
mankind
and
he
who
hates
them
such
a
meeting
would
be
enough
to
sweep
the
earth
out
of
existence
vi
old
faustina
was
in
distant
palestine
on
her
way
to
jerusalem
she
had
not
desired
that
the
mission
to
seek
the
prophet
and
bring
him
to
the
emperor
should
be
intrusted
to
any
one
but
herself
she
said
to
herself
that
which
we
demand
of
this
stranger
is
something
which
we
can
not
coax
from
him
either
by
force
or
bribes
but
perhaps
he
will
grant
it
us
if
some
one
falls
at
his
feet
and
tells
him
in
what
dire
need
the
emperor
is
who
can
make
an
honest
plea
for
tiberius
but
the
one
who
suffers
from
his
misfortune
as
much
as
he
does
the
hope
of
possibly
saving
tiberius
had
renewed
the
old
woman
s
youth
she
withstood
without
difficulty
the
long
sea
trip
to
joppa
and
on
the
journey
to
jerusalem
she
made
no
use
of
a
litter
but
rode
a
horse
she
appeared
to
stand
the
difficult
ride
as
easily
as
the
roman
nobles
the
soldiers
and
the
slaves
who
made
up
her
retinue
the
journey
from
joppa
to
jerusalem
filled
the
old
woman
s
heart
with
joy
and
bright
hopes
it
was
springtime
and
sharon
s
plain
over
which
they
had
ridden
during
the
first
day
s
travel
had
been
a
brilliant
carpet
of
flowers
even
during
the
second
day
s
journey
when
they
came
to
the
hills
of
judea
they
were
not
abandoned
by
the
flowers
all
the
multiformed
hills
between
which
the
road
wound
were
planted
with
fruit
trees
which
stood
in
full
bloom
and
when
the
travelers
wearied
of
looking
at
the
white
and
red
blossoms
of
the
apricots
and
persimmons
they
could
rest
their
eyes
by
observing
the
young
which
pushed
their
way
through
the
dark
brown
branches
and
their
growth
was
so
rapid
that
one
could
almost
follow
it
with
the
eye
it
was
not
only
flowers
and
spring
green
that
made
the
journey
pleasant
but
the
pleasure
was
enhanced
by
watching
the
throngs
of
people
who
were
on
their
way
to
jerusalem
this
morning
from
all
the
roads
and
from
lonely
heights
and
from
the
most
remote
corners
of
the
plain
came
travelers
when
they
had
reached
the
road
to
jerusalem
those
who
traveled
alone
formed
themselves
into
companies
and
marched
forward
with
glad
shouts
round
an
elderly
man
who
rode
on
a
jogging
camel
walked
his
sons
and
daughters
his
and
and
all
his
grandchildren
it
was
such
a
large
family
that
it
made
up
an
entire
little
village
an
old
grandmother
who
was
too
feeble
to
walk
her
sons
had
taken
in
their
arms
and
with
pride
she
let
herself
be
borne
among
the
crowds
who
respectfully
stepped
aside
in
truth
it
was
a
morning
to
inspire
joy
even
in
the
most
disconsolate
to
be
sure
the
sky
was
not
clear
but
was
o
ercast
with
a
thin
mist
but
none
of
the
wayfarers
thought
of
grumbling
because
the
sun
s
piercing
brilliancy
was
dampened
under
this
veiled
sky
the
perfume
of
the
budding
leaves
and
blossoms
did
not
penetrate
the
air
as
usual
but
lingered
over
roads
and
fields
and
this
beautiful
day
with
its
faint
mist
and
hushed
winds
which
reminded
one
of
night
s
rest
and
calm
seemed
to
communicate
to
the
hastening
crowds
somewhat
of
itself
so
that
they
went
forward
with
in
subdued
voices
ancient
hymns
or
playing
upon
peculiar
instruments
from
which
came
tones
like
the
buzzing
of
gnats
or
grasshoppers
piping
when
old
faustina
rode
forward
among
all
the
people
she
became
infected
with
their
joy
and
excitement
she
prodded
her
horse
to
quicker
speed
as
she
said
to
a
young
roman
who
rode
beside
her
i
dreamt
last
night
that
i
saw
tiberius
and
he
implored
me
not
to
postpone
the
journey
but
to
ride
to
jerusalem
it
appears
as
if
the
gods
had
wished
to
send
me
a
warning
not
to
neglect
to
go
there
this
beautiful
just
as
she
said
this
she
came
to
the
top
of
a
long
mountain
ridge
and
there
she
was
obliged
to
halt
before
her
lay
a
large
deep
surrounded
by
pretty
hills
and
from
the
dark
shadowy
depths
of
the
vale
rose
the
massive
mountain
which
held
on
its
head
the
city
of
jerusalem
but
the
narrow
mountain
city
with
its
walls
and
towers
which
lay
like
a
jeweled
coronet
upon
the
cliff
s
smooth
height
was
this
day
magnified
a
all
the
hills
which
encircled
the
valley
were
bedecked
with
gay
tents
and
with
a
swarm
of
human
beings
it
was
evident
to
faustina
that
all
the
inhabitants
were
on
their
way
to
jerusalem
to
celebrate
some
great
holiday
those
from
a
distance
had
already
come
and
had
managed
to
put
their
tents
in
order
on
the
other
hand
those
who
lived
near
the
city
were
still
on
their
way
along
all
the
shining
one
saw
them
come
streaming
in
like
an
unbroken
sea
of
white
robes
of
songs
of
holiday
cheer
for
some
time
the
old
woman
surveyed
these
seething
throngs
of
people
and
the
long
rows
of
thereupon
she
said
to
the
young
roman
who
rode
beside
her
verily
sulpicius
the
whole
nation
must
have
come
to
it
really
appears
like
it
replied
the
roman
who
had
been
chosen
by
tiberius
to
accompany
faustina
because
he
had
during
a
number
of
years
lived
in
judea
they
celebrate
now
the
great
spring
festival
and
at
this
time
all
the
people
both
old
and
young
come
to
faustina
reflected
a
moment
i
am
glad
that
we
came
to
this
city
on
the
day
that
the
people
celebrate
their
festival
said
she
it
can
not
signify
anything
else
than
that
the
gods
protect
our
journey
do
you
think
it
likely
that
he
whom
we
seek
the
prophet
of
nazareth
has
also
come
to
jerusalem
to
participate
in
the
festivities
you
are
surely
right
faustina
said
the
roman
he
must
be
here
in
jerusalem
this
is
indeed
a
decree
of
the
gods
strong
and
vigorous
though
you
be
you
may
consider
yourself
fortunate
if
you
escape
making
the
long
and
troublesome
journey
up
to
at
once
he
rode
over
to
a
couple
of
wayfarers
and
asked
them
if
they
thought
the
prophet
of
nazareth
was
in
jerusalem
we
have
seen
him
here
every
day
at
this
season
answered
one
surely
he
must
be
here
even
this
year
for
he
is
a
holy
and
righteous
a
woman
stretched
forth
her
hand
and
pointed
towards
a
hill
which
lay
east
of
the
city
do
you
see
the
foot
of
that
mountain
which
is
covered
with
olive
trees
she
said
it
is
there
that
the
galileans
usually
raise
their
tents
and
there
you
will
get
the
most
reliable
information
about
him
whom
you
they
journeyed
farther
and
traveled
on
a
winding
path
all
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
then
they
began
to
ride
up
toward
zion
s
hill
to
reach
the
city
on
its
heights
the
woman
who
had
spoken
went
along
the
same
way
the
steep
ascending
road
was
encompassed
here
by
low
walls
and
upon
these
countless
beggars
and
cripples
sat
or
lolled
look
said
the
woman
who
had
spoken
pointing
to
one
of
the
beggars
who
sat
on
the
wall
there
is
a
galilean
i
recollect
that
i
have
seen
him
among
the
prophet
s
disciples
he
can
tell
you
where
you
will
find
him
you
faustina
and
sulpicius
rode
up
to
the
man
who
had
been
pointed
out
to
her
he
was
a
poor
old
man
with
a
heavy
beard
his
face
was
bronzed
by
heat
and
sunshine
he
asked
no
alms
on
the
contrary
he
was
so
engrossed
in
anxious
thought
that
he
did
not
even
glance
at
the
nor
did
he
hear
that
sulpicius
addressed
him
and
the
latter
had
to
repeat
his
question
several
times
my
friend
i
ve
been
told
that
you
are
a
galilean
i
beg
you
therefore
to
tell
me
where
i
shall
find
the
prophet
from
nazareth
the
galilean
gave
a
sudden
start
and
looked
around
him
confused
but
when
he
finally
comprehended
what
was
wanted
of
him
he
was
seized
with
rage
mixed
with
terror
what
are
you
talking
about
he
burst
out
why
do
you
ask
me
about
that
man
i
know
nothing
of
him
i
m
not
a
the
hebrew
woman
now
joined
in
the
conversation
still
i
have
seen
you
in
his
company
she
protested
do
not
fear
but
tell
this
noble
roman
lady
who
is
the
emperor
s
friend
where
she
is
most
likely
to
find
but
the
terrified
disciple
grew
more
and
more
irascible
have
all
the
people
gone
mad
said
he
are
they
possessed
by
an
evil
spirit
since
they
come
again
and
again
and
ask
me
about
that
man
why
will
no
one
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
do
not
know
the
prophet
i
do
not
come
from
his
country
i
have
never
seen
his
irritability
attracted
attention
and
a
couple
of
beggars
who
sat
on
the
wall
beside
him
also
began
to
dispute
his
word
certainly
you
were
among
his
disciples
said
one
we
all
know
that
you
came
with
him
from
then
the
man
raised
his
arms
toward
heaven
and
cried
i
could
not
endure
it
in
jerusalem
on
that
man
s
account
and
now
they
will
not
even
leave
me
in
peace
out
here
among
the
beggars
why
don
t
you
believe
me
when
i
say
to
you
that
i
have
never
seen
him
faustina
turned
away
with
a
shrug
let
us
go
farther
said
she
the
man
is
mad
from
him
we
will
learn
they
went
farther
up
the
mountain
faustina
was
not
more
than
two
steps
from
the
city
gate
when
the
hebrew
woman
who
had
wished
to
help
her
find
the
prophet
called
to
her
to
be
careful
she
pulled
in
her
reins
and
saw
that
a
man
lay
in
the
road
just
in
front
of
the
horse
s
feet
where
the
crush
was
greatest
it
was
a
miracle
that
he
had
not
already
been
trampled
to
death
by
animals
or
people
the
man
lay
upon
his
back
and
stared
upward
with
lusterless
eyes
he
did
not
move
although
the
camels
placed
their
heavy
feet
close
beside
him
he
was
poorly
clad
and
besides
he
was
covered
with
dust
and
dirt
in
fact
he
had
thrown
so
much
gravel
over
himself
that
it
looked
as
if
he
tried
to
hide
himself
to
be
more
easily
and
trampled
down
what
does
this
mean
why
does
this
man
lie
here
on
the
road
asked
faustina
instantly
the
man
began
shouting
to
the
in
mercy
brothers
and
sisters
drive
your
horses
and
camels
over
me
do
not
turn
aside
for
me
trample
me
to
dust
i
have
betrayed
innocent
blood
trample
me
to
dust
sulpicius
caught
faustina
s
horse
by
the
bridle
and
turned
it
to
one
side
it
is
a
sinner
who
wants
to
do
penance
said
he
do
not
let
this
delay
your
journey
these
people
are
peculiar
and
one
must
let
them
follow
their
own
the
man
in
the
road
continued
to
shout
set
your
heels
on
my
heart
let
the
camels
crush
my
breast
and
the
asses
dig
their
hoofs
into
my
eyes
but
faustina
seemed
loath
to
ride
past
the
miserable
man
without
trying
to
make
him
rise
she
remained
all
the
while
beside
him
the
hebrew
woman
who
had
wished
to
serve
her
once
before
pushed
her
way
forward
again
this
man
also
belonged
to
the
prophet
s
disciples
said
she
do
you
wish
me
to
ask
him
about
his
master
faustina
nodded
affirmatively
and
the
woman
bent
down
over
the
man
what
have
you
galileans
done
this
day
with
your
master
she
asked
i
meet
you
scattered
on
highways
and
byways
but
him
i
see
but
when
she
questioned
in
this
manner
the
man
who
lay
in
the
dust
rose
to
his
knees
what
evil
spirit
hath
possessed
you
to
ask
me
about
him
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
filled
with
despair
you
see
surely
that
i
have
lain
down
in
the
road
to
be
trampled
to
death
is
not
that
enough
for
you
shall
you
come
also
and
ask
me
what
i
have
done
with
him
when
she
repeated
the
question
the
man
staggered
to
his
feet
and
put
both
hands
to
his
ears
woe
unto
you
that
you
can
not
let
me
die
in
peace
he
cried
he
forced
his
way
through
the
crowds
that
thronged
in
front
of
the
gate
and
rushed
away
shrieking
with
terror
while
his
torn
robe
fluttered
around
him
like
dark
wings
it
appears
to
me
as
though
we
had
come
to
a
nation
of
madmen
said
faustina
when
she
saw
the
man
flee
she
had
become
depressed
by
seeing
these
disciples
of
the
prophet
could
the
man
who
numbered
such
fools
among
his
followers
do
anything
for
the
emperor
even
the
hebrew
woman
looked
distressed
and
she
said
very
earnestly
to
faustina
mistress
delay
not
in
your
search
for
him
whom
you
would
find
i
fear
some
evil
has
befallen
him
since
his
disciples
are
beside
themselves
and
can
not
bear
to
hear
him
spoken
faustina
and
her
retinue
finally
rode
through
the
gate
archway
and
came
in
on
the
narrow
and
dark
streets
which
were
alive
with
people
it
seemed
impossible
to
get
through
the
city
the
riders
time
and
again
had
to
stand
still
slaves
and
soldiers
tried
in
vain
to
clear
the
way
the
people
continued
to
rush
on
in
a
compact
irresistible
stream
verily
said
the
old
woman
the
streets
of
rome
are
peaceful
pleasure
gardens
compared
with
these
sulpicius
soon
saw
that
almost
insurmountable
difficulties
awaited
them
on
these
overcrowded
streets
it
is
easier
to
walk
than
to
ride
said
he
if
you
are
not
too
fatigued
i
should
advise
you
to
walk
to
the
governor
s
palace
it
is
a
good
distance
away
but
if
we
ride
we
certainly
will
not
get
there
until
after
faustina
accepted
the
suggestion
at
once
she
dismounted
and
left
her
horse
with
one
of
the
slaves
thereupon
the
roman
travelers
began
to
walk
through
the
city
this
was
much
better
they
pushed
their
way
quickly
toward
the
heart
of
the
city
and
sulpicius
showed
faustina
a
rather
wide
street
which
they
were
nearing
look
faustina
he
said
if
we
take
this
street
we
will
soon
be
there
it
leads
directly
down
to
our
but
just
as
they
were
about
to
turn
into
the
street
the
worst
obstacle
met
them
it
happened
that
the
very
moment
when
faustina
reached
the
street
which
extended
from
the
governor
s
palace
to
righteousness
gate
and
golgotha
they
brought
through
it
a
prisoner
who
was
to
be
taken
out
and
crucified
before
him
ran
a
crowd
of
wild
youths
who
wanted
to
witness
the
execution
they
raced
up
the
street
waved
their
arms
in
rapture
towards
the
hill
and
emitted
unintelligible
their
delight
at
being
allowed
to
view
something
which
they
did
not
see
every
day
behind
them
came
companies
of
men
in
silken
robes
who
appeared
to
belong
to
the
city
s
élite
and
foremost
then
came
women
many
of
whom
had
faces
a
gathering
of
poor
and
maimed
staggered
forward
uttering
shrieks
that
pierced
the
ears
o
god
they
cried
save
him
send
thine
angel
and
save
him
send
a
deliverer
in
his
direst
need
finally
there
came
a
few
roman
soldiers
on
great
horses
they
kept
guard
so
that
none
of
the
people
could
dash
up
to
the
prisoner
and
try
to
rescue
him
directly
behind
them
followed
the
executioners
whose
task
it
was
to
lead
forward
the
man
that
was
to
be
crucified
they
had
laid
a
heavy
wooden
cross
over
his
shoulder
but
he
was
too
weak
for
this
burden
it
weighed
him
down
so
that
his
body
was
almost
bent
to
the
ground
he
held
his
head
down
so
far
that
no
one
could
see
his
face
faustina
stood
at
the
opening
of
the
little
bystreet
and
saw
the
doomed
man
s
heavy
tread
she
noticed
with
surprise
that
he
wore
a
purple
mantle
and
that
a
crown
of
thorns
was
pressed
down
upon
his
head
who
is
this
man
she
asked
one
of
the
bystanders
answered
her
it
is
one
who
wished
to
make
himself
and
must
he
suffer
death
for
a
thing
which
is
scarcely
worth
striving
after
said
the
old
woman
sadly
the
doomed
man
staggered
under
the
cross
he
dragged
himself
forward
more
and
more
slowly
the
executioners
had
tied
a
rope
around
his
waist
and
they
began
to
pull
on
it
to
hasten
the
speed
but
as
they
pulled
the
rope
the
man
fell
and
lay
there
with
the
cross
over
him
there
was
a
terrible
uproar
the
roman
soldiers
had
all
they
could
do
to
hold
the
crowds
back
they
drew
their
swords
on
a
couple
of
women
who
tried
to
rush
forward
to
help
the
fallen
man
the
executioners
attempted
to
force
him
up
with
cuffs
and
lashes
but
he
could
not
move
because
of
the
cross
finally
two
of
them
took
hold
of
the
cross
to
remove
it
then
he
raised
his
head
and
old
faustina
could
see
his
face
the
cheeks
were
streaked
by
lashes
from
a
whip
and
from
his
brow
which
was
wounded
by
the
trickled
some
drops
of
blood
his
hair
hung
in
knotted
tangles
clotted
with
sweat
and
blood
his
jaw
was
firm
set
but
his
lips
trembled
as
if
they
struggled
to
suppress
a
cry
his
eyes
and
almost
blinded
from
torture
and
fatigue
stared
straight
ahead
but
back
of
this
person
s
face
the
old
woman
in
a
pale
and
beautiful
one
with
glorious
majestic
eyes
and
gentle
features
and
she
was
seized
with
sudden
by
the
unknown
man
s
misfortune
and
degradation
oh
what
have
they
done
with
you
you
poor
soul
she
burst
out
and
moved
a
step
nearer
him
while
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
forgot
her
own
sorrow
and
anxiety
for
this
tortured
man
s
distress
she
thought
her
heart
would
burst
from
pity
she
like
the
other
women
wanted
to
rush
forward
and
tear
him
away
from
the
executioners
the
fallen
man
saw
how
she
came
toward
him
and
he
crept
closer
to
her
it
was
as
though
he
had
expected
to
find
protection
with
her
against
all
those
who
persecuted
and
tortured
him
he
embraced
her
knees
he
pressed
himself
against
her
like
a
child
who
clings
close
to
his
mother
for
safety
the
old
woman
bent
over
him
and
as
the
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
she
felt
the
most
blissful
joy
because
he
had
come
and
sought
protection
with
her
she
placed
one
arm
around
his
neck
and
as
a
mother
first
of
all
wipes
away
the
tears
from
her
child
s
eyes
she
laid
her
kerchief
of
sheer
fine
linen
over
his
face
to
wipe
away
the
tears
and
the
blood
but
now
the
executioners
were
ready
with
the
cross
they
came
now
and
snatched
away
the
prisoner
impatient
over
the
delay
they
dragged
him
off
in
wild
haste
the
condemned
man
uttered
a
groan
when
he
was
led
away
from
the
refuge
he
had
found
but
he
made
no
resistance
faustina
embraced
him
to
hold
him
back
and
when
her
feeble
old
hands
were
powerless
and
she
saw
him
borne
away
she
felt
as
if
some
one
had
torn
from
her
her
own
child
and
she
cried
no
no
do
not
take
him
from
me
he
must
not
die
he
shall
not
die
she
felt
the
most
intense
grief
and
indignation
because
he
was
being
led
away
she
wanted
to
rush
after
him
she
wanted
to
fight
with
the
executioners
and
tear
him
from
them
but
with
the
first
step
she
took
she
was
seized
with
weakness
and
dizziness
sulpicius
made
haste
to
place
his
arm
around
her
to
prevent
her
from
falling
on
one
side
of
the
street
he
saw
a
little
shop
and
carried
her
in
there
was
neither
bench
nor
chair
inside
but
the
shopkeeper
was
a
kindly
man
he
helped
her
over
to
a
rug
and
arranged
a
bed
for
her
on
the
stone
floor
she
was
not
unconscious
but
such
a
great
dizziness
had
seized
her
that
she
could
not
sit
up
but
was
forced
to
lie
down
she
has
made
a
long
journey
and
the
noise
and
crush
in
the
city
have
been
too
much
for
her
said
sulpicius
to
the
merchant
she
is
very
old
and
no
one
is
so
strong
as
not
to
be
conquered
by
this
is
a
trying
day
even
for
one
who
is
not
old
said
the
merchant
the
air
is
almost
too
heavy
to
breathe
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
a
severe
storm
were
in
store
for
sulpicius
bent
over
the
old
woman
she
had
fallen
asleep
and
she
slept
with
calm
regular
respirations
after
all
the
excitement
and
fatigue
he
walked
over
to
the
shop
door
stood
there
and
looked
at
the
crowds
while
he
awaited
her
waking
vii
the
roman
governor
at
jerusalem
had
a
young
wife
and
she
had
had
a
dream
during
the
night
preceding
the
day
when
faustina
entered
the
city
she
dreamed
that
she
stood
on
the
roof
of
her
house
and
looked
down
upon
the
beautiful
court
which
according
to
the
oriental
custom
was
paved
with
marble
and
planted
with
rare
growths
but
in
the
court
she
saw
assembled
all
the
sick
and
blind
and
halt
there
were
in
the
world
she
saw
before
her
the
with
bodies
swollen
with
boils
lepers
with
disfigured
faces
the
paralytics
who
could
not
move
but
lay
helpless
upon
the
ground
and
all
the
wretched
creatures
who
writhed
in
torment
and
pain
they
all
crowded
up
towards
the
entrance
to
get
into
the
house
and
a
number
of
those
who
walked
foremost
pounded
on
the
palace
door
at
last
she
saw
that
a
slave
opened
the
door
and
came
out
on
the
threshold
and
she
heard
him
ask
what
they
wanted
then
they
answered
him
saying
we
seek
the
great
prophet
whom
god
hath
sent
to
the
world
where
is
the
prophet
of
nazareth
he
who
is
master
of
all
suffering
where
is
he
who
can
deliver
us
from
all
our
torment
then
the
slave
answered
them
in
an
arrogant
and
indifferent
palace
servants
do
when
they
turn
away
the
poor
stranger
it
will
profit
you
nothing
to
seek
the
great
prophet
pilate
has
killed
then
there
arose
among
all
the
sick
a
grief
and
a
moaning
and
a
gnashing
of
teeth
which
she
could
not
bear
to
hear
her
heart
was
wrung
with
compassion
and
tears
streamed
from
her
eyes
but
when
she
had
begun
to
weep
she
awakened
again
she
fell
asleep
and
again
she
dreamed
that
she
stood
on
the
roof
of
her
house
and
looked
down
upon
the
big
court
which
was
as
broad
as
a
square
and
behold
the
court
was
filled
with
all
the
insane
and
and
those
possessed
of
evil
spirits
and
she
saw
those
who
were
naked
and
those
who
were
covered
with
their
long
hair
and
those
who
had
braided
themselves
crowns
of
straw
and
mantles
of
grass
and
believed
they
were
kings
and
those
who
crawled
on
the
ground
and
thought
themselves
beasts
and
those
who
came
dragging
heavy
stones
which
they
believed
to
be
gold
and
those
who
thought
that
the
evil
spirits
spoke
through
their
mouths
she
saw
all
these
crowd
up
toward
the
palace
gate
and
the
ones
who
stood
nearest
to
it
knocked
and
pounded
to
get
in
at
last
the
door
opened
and
a
slave
stepped
out
on
the
threshold
and
asked
what
do
you
want
then
all
began
to
cry
aloud
saying
where
is
the
great
prophet
of
nazareth
he
who
was
sent
of
god
and
who
shall
restore
to
us
our
souls
and
our
wits
she
heard
the
slave
answer
them
in
the
most
indifferent
tone
it
is
useless
for
you
to
seek
the
great
prophet
pilate
has
killed
when
this
was
said
they
uttered
a
shriek
as
wild
as
a
beast
s
howl
and
in
their
despair
they
began
to
lacerate
themselves
until
the
blood
ran
down
on
the
stones
and
when
she
that
dreamed
saw
their
distress
she
wrung
her
hands
and
moaned
and
her
own
moans
awakened
her
but
again
she
fell
asleep
and
again
in
her
dream
she
was
on
the
roof
of
her
house
round
about
her
sat
her
slaves
who
played
for
her
upon
cymbals
and
zithers
and
the
almond
trees
shook
their
white
blossoms
over
her
and
clambering
exhaled
their
perfume
as
she
sat
there
a
voice
spoke
to
her
go
over
to
the
balustrade
which
incloses
the
roof
and
see
who
they
are
that
stand
and
wait
in
your
court
but
in
the
dream
she
declined
and
said
i
do
not
care
to
see
any
more
of
those
who
throng
my
court
just
then
she
heard
a
clanking
of
chains
and
a
pounding
of
heavy
hammers
and
the
pounding
of
wood
against
wood
her
slaves
ceased
their
singing
and
playing
and
hurried
over
to
the
railing
and
looked
down
nor
could
she
herself
remain
seated
but
walked
thither
and
looked
down
on
the
court
then
she
saw
that
the
court
was
filled
with
all
the
poor
prisoners
in
the
world
she
saw
those
who
must
lie
in
dark
prison
dungeons
fettered
with
heavy
chains
she
saw
those
who
labored
in
the
dark
mines
come
dragging
their
heavy
planks
and
those
who
were
rowers
on
war
galleys
come
with
their
heavy
oars
and
those
who
were
condemned
to
be
crucified
came
dragging
their
crosses
and
those
who
were
to
be
beheaded
came
with
their
broadaxes
she
saw
those
who
were
sent
into
slavery
to
foreign
lands
and
whose
eyes
burned
with
homesickness
she
saw
those
who
must
serve
as
beasts
of
burden
and
whose
backs
were
bleeding
from
lashes
all
these
unfortunates
cried
as
with
one
voice
open
open
then
the
slave
who
guarded
the
entrance
stepped
to
the
door
and
asked
what
is
it
that
you
wish
and
these
answered
like
the
others
we
seek
the
great
prophet
of
nazareth
who
has
come
to
the
world
to
give
the
prisoners
their
freedom
and
the
slaves
their
lost
the
slave
answered
them
in
a
tired
and
indifferent
tone
you
can
not
find
him
here
pilate
has
killed
when
this
was
said
she
who
dreamed
thought
that
among
all
the
unhappy
there
arose
such
an
outburst
of
scorn
and
blasphemy
that
heaven
and
earth
trembled
she
was
with
fright
and
her
body
shook
so
that
she
awaked
when
she
was
thoroughly
awake
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
thought
to
herself
i
would
not
dream
more
now
i
want
to
remain
awake
all
night
that
i
may
escape
seeing
more
of
this
and
even
whilst
she
was
thinking
thus
drowsiness
crept
in
upon
her
anew
and
she
laid
her
head
on
the
pillow
and
fell
asleep
again
she
dreamed
that
she
sat
on
the
roof
of
her
house
and
now
her
little
son
ran
back
and
forth
up
there
and
played
with
a
ball
then
she
heard
a
voice
that
said
to
her
go
over
to
the
balustrade
which
incloses
the
roof
and
see
who
they
are
that
stand
and
wait
in
your
court
but
she
who
dreamed
said
to
herself
i
have
seen
enough
misery
this
night
i
can
not
endure
any
more
i
would
remain
where
i
at
that
moment
her
son
threw
his
ball
so
that
it
dropped
outside
the
balustrade
and
the
child
ran
forward
and
clambered
up
on
the
railing
then
she
was
frightened
she
rushed
over
and
seized
hold
of
the
child
but
with
that
she
happened
to
cast
her
eyes
downward
and
once
more
she
saw
that
the
court
was
full
of
people
in
the
court
were
all
the
peoples
of
earth
who
had
been
wounded
in
battle
they
came
with
severed
bodies
with
limbs
and
with
big
open
wounds
from
which
the
blood
oozed
so
that
the
whole
court
was
drenched
with
it
and
beside
these
came
all
the
people
in
the
world
who
had
lost
their
loved
ones
on
the
battlefield
they
were
the
fatherless
who
mourned
their
protectors
and
the
young
maidens
who
cried
for
their
lovers
and
the
aged
who
sighed
for
their
sons
the
foremost
among
them
pushed
against
the
door
and
the
watchman
came
out
as
before
and
opened
it
he
asked
all
these
who
had
been
wounded
in
battles
and
skirmishes
what
seek
ye
in
this
house
and
they
answered
we
seek
the
great
prophet
of
nazareth
who
shall
prohibit
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
and
bring
peace
to
the
earth
we
seek
him
who
shall
convert
spears
into
scythes
and
swords
into
pruning
then
answered
the
slave
somewhat
impatiently
let
no
more
come
to
pester
me
i
have
already
said
it
often
enough
the
great
prophet
is
not
here
pilate
has
killed
thereupon
he
closed
the
gate
but
she
who
dreamed
thought
of
all
the
lamentation
which
would
come
now
i
do
not
wish
to
hear
it
said
she
and
rushed
away
from
the
balustrade
that
instant
she
awoke
then
she
discovered
that
in
her
terror
she
had
jumped
out
of
her
bed
and
down
on
the
cold
stone
floor
again
she
thought
she
did
not
want
to
sleep
more
that
night
and
again
sleep
overpowered
her
and
she
closed
her
eyes
and
began
to
dream
she
sat
once
more
on
the
roof
of
her
house
and
beside
her
stood
her
husband
she
told
him
of
her
dreams
and
he
ridiculed
her
again
she
heard
a
voice
which
said
to
her
go
see
the
people
who
wait
in
your
court
but
she
thought
i
would
not
see
them
i
have
seen
enough
misery
just
then
she
heard
three
loud
raps
on
the
gate
and
her
husband
walked
over
to
the
balustrade
to
see
who
it
was
that
asked
admittance
to
his
house
but
no
sooner
had
he
leaned
over
the
railing
than
he
beckoned
to
his
wife
to
come
over
to
him
know
you
not
this
man
said
he
and
pointed
down
when
she
looked
down
on
the
court
she
found
that
it
was
filled
with
horses
and
riders
slaves
were
busy
unloading
asses
and
camels
it
looked
as
though
a
distinguished
traveler
might
have
landed
at
the
entrance
gate
stood
the
traveler
he
was
a
large
elderly
man
with
broad
shoulders
and
a
heavy
and
gloomy
appearance
the
dreamer
recognized
the
stranger
instantly
and
whispered
to
her
husband
it
is
cæsar
tiberius
who
is
here
in
jerusalem
it
can
not
be
any
one
i
also
seem
to
recognize
him
said
her
husband
at
the
same
time
he
placed
his
finger
on
his
mouth
as
a
signal
that
they
should
be
quiet
and
listen
to
what
was
said
down
in
the
court
they
saw
that
the
doorkeeper
came
out
and
asked
the
stranger
whom
seek
you
and
the
traveler
answered
i
seek
the
great
prophet
of
nazareth
who
is
endowed
with
god
s
power
to
perform
miracles
it
is
emperor
tiberius
who
calls
him
that
he
may
liberate
him
from
a
terrible
disease
which
no
other
physician
can
when
he
had
spoken
the
slave
bowed
very
humbly
and
said
my
lord
be
not
wroth
but
your
wish
can
not
be
then
the
emperor
turned
toward
his
slaves
who
waited
below
in
the
court
and
gave
them
a
command
then
the
slaves
hastened
with
handfuls
of
ornaments
others
carried
goblets
studded
with
pearls
other
again
dragged
sacks
filled
with
gold
coin
the
emperor
turned
to
the
slave
who
guarded
the
gate
and
said
all
this
shall
be
his
if
he
helps
tiberius
with
this
he
can
give
riches
to
all
the
world
s
but
the
doorkeeper
bowed
still
lower
and
said
master
be
not
wroth
with
thy
servant
but
thy
request
can
not
be
then
the
emperor
beckoned
again
to
his
slaves
and
a
pair
of
them
hurried
forward
with
a
richly
embroidered
robe
upon
which
glittered
a
breastpiece
of
jewels
and
the
emperor
said
to
the
slave
see
this
which
i
offer
him
is
the
power
over
judea
he
shall
rule
his
people
like
the
highest
judge
if
he
will
only
come
and
heal
tiberius
the
slave
bowed
still
nearer
the
earth
and
said
master
it
is
not
within
my
power
to
help
then
the
emperor
beckoned
once
again
and
his
slaves
rushed
up
with
a
golden
coronet
and
a
purple
mantle
see
he
said
this
is
the
emperor
s
will
he
promises
to
appoint
the
prophet
his
successor
and
give
him
dominion
over
the
world
he
shall
have
power
to
rule
the
world
according
to
his
god
s
will
if
he
will
only
stretch
forth
his
hand
and
heal
tiberius
then
the
slave
fell
at
the
emperor
s
feet
and
said
in
an
imploring
tone
master
it
does
not
lie
in
my
power
to
attend
to
thy
command
he
whom
thou
seekest
is
no
longer
here
pilate
hath
killed
viii
when
the
young
woman
awoke
it
was
already
full
clear
day
and
her
female
slaves
stood
and
waited
that
they
might
help
her
dress
she
was
very
silent
while
she
dressed
but
finally
she
asked
the
slave
who
arranged
her
hair
if
her
husband
was
up
she
learned
that
he
had
been
called
out
to
pass
judgment
on
a
criminal
i
should
have
liked
to
talk
with
him
said
the
young
woman
mistress
said
the
slave
it
will
be
difficult
to
do
so
during
the
trial
we
will
let
you
know
as
soon
as
it
is
she
sat
silent
now
until
her
toilet
was
completed
then
she
asked
has
any
among
you
heard
of
the
prophet
of
nazareth
the
prophet
of
nazareth
is
a
jewish
miracle
performer
answered
one
of
the
slaves
instantly
it
is
strange
mistress
that
you
should
ask
after
him
said
another
slave
it
is
just
he
whom
the
jews
have
brought
here
to
the
palace
to
let
him
be
tried
by
the
she
bade
them
go
at
once
and
ascertain
for
what
cause
he
was
arraigned
and
one
of
the
slaves
withdrew
when
she
returned
she
said
they
accuse
him
of
wanting
to
make
himself
king
over
this
land
and
they
entreat
the
governor
to
let
him
be
when
the
governor
s
wife
heard
this
she
grew
terrified
and
said
i
must
speak
with
my
husband
otherwise
a
terrible
calamity
will
happen
here
this
when
the
slaves
said
once
again
that
this
was
impossible
she
began
to
weep
and
shudder
and
one
among
them
was
touched
so
she
said
if
you
will
send
a
written
message
to
the
governor
i
will
try
and
take
it
to
immediately
she
took
a
stylus
and
wrote
a
few
words
on
a
wax
tablet
and
this
was
given
to
pilate
but
him
she
did
not
meet
alone
the
whole
day
for
when
he
had
dismissed
the
jews
and
the
condemned
man
was
taken
to
the
place
of
execution
the
hour
for
repast
was
come
and
to
this
pilate
had
invited
a
few
of
the
romans
who
visited
jerusalem
at
this
season
they
were
the
commander
of
the
troops
and
a
young
instructor
in
oratory
and
several
others
besides
this
repast
was
not
very
gay
for
the
governor
s
wife
sat
all
the
while
silent
and
dejected
and
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
when
the
guests
asked
if
she
was
ill
or
distraught
the
governor
laughingly
related
about
the
message
she
had
sent
him
in
the
morning
he
chaffed
her
because
she
had
believed
that
a
roman
governor
would
let
himself
be
guided
in
his
judgments
by
a
woman
s
dreams
she
answered
gently
and
sadly
in
truth
it
was
no
dream
but
a
warning
sent
by
the
gods
you
should
at
least
have
let
the
man
live
through
this
one
they
saw
that
she
was
seriously
distressed
she
would
not
be
comforted
no
matter
how
much
the
guests
exerted
themselves
by
keeping
up
the
conversation
to
make
her
forget
these
empty
fancies
but
after
a
while
one
of
them
raised
his
head
and
exclaimed
what
is
this
have
we
sat
so
long
at
table
that
the
day
is
already
gone
all
looked
up
now
and
they
observed
that
a
dim
twilight
settled
down
over
nature
above
all
it
was
remarkable
to
see
how
the
whole
variegated
play
of
color
which
it
spread
over
all
creatures
and
objects
faded
away
slowly
so
that
all
looked
a
uniform
gray
like
everything
else
even
their
own
faces
lost
their
color
we
actually
look
like
the
dead
said
the
young
orator
with
a
shudder
our
cheeks
are
gray
and
our
lips
as
this
darkness
grew
more
intense
the
woman
s
fear
increased
oh
my
friend
she
burst
out
at
last
can
t
you
perceive
even
now
that
the
immortals
would
warn
you
they
are
incensed
because
you
condemned
a
holy
and
innocent
man
i
am
thinking
that
although
he
may
already
be
on
the
cross
he
is
surely
not
dead
yet
let
him
be
taken
down
from
the
cross
i
would
with
mine
own
hands
nurse
his
wounds
only
grant
that
he
be
called
back
to
life
but
pilate
answered
laughingly
you
are
surely
right
in
that
this
is
a
sign
from
the
gods
but
they
do
not
let
the
sun
lose
its
luster
because
a
jewish
heretic
has
been
condemned
to
the
cross
on
the
contrary
we
may
expect
that
important
matters
shall
appear
which
concern
the
whole
kingdom
who
can
tell
how
long
old
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
for
the
darkness
had
become
so
profound
he
could
not
see
even
the
wine
goblet
standing
in
front
of
him
he
broke
off
therefore
to
order
the
slaves
to
fetch
some
lamps
instantly
when
it
had
become
so
light
that
he
could
see
the
faces
of
his
guests
it
was
impossible
for
him
not
to
notice
the
depression
which
had
come
over
them
mark
you
he
said
to
his
wife
now
it
is
apparent
to
me
that
you
have
succeeded
with
your
dreams
in
driving
away
the
joys
of
the
table
but
if
it
must
needs
be
that
you
can
not
think
of
anything
else
then
let
us
hear
what
you
have
dreamed
tell
it
us
and
we
will
try
to
interpret
its
meaning
for
this
the
young
wife
was
ready
at
once
and
while
she
related
vision
after
vision
the
guests
grew
more
and
more
serious
they
ceased
emptying
their
goblets
and
they
sat
with
brows
knit
the
only
one
who
continued
to
laugh
and
to
call
the
whole
thing
madness
was
the
governor
himself
when
the
narrative
was
ended
the
young
rhetorician
said
truly
this
is
something
more
than
a
dream
for
i
have
seen
this
day
not
the
emperor
but
his
old
friend
faustina
march
into
the
city
only
it
surprises
me
that
she
has
not
already
appeared
in
the
governor
s
there
is
actually
a
rumor
abroad
to
the
effect
that
the
emperor
has
been
stricken
with
a
terrible
illness
observed
the
leader
of
the
troops
it
also
seems
very
possible
to
me
that
your
wife
s
dream
may
be
a
there
s
nothing
incredible
in
this
that
tiberius
has
sent
messengers
after
the
prophet
to
summon
him
to
his
agreed
the
young
rhetorician
the
commander
turned
with
profound
seriousness
toward
pilate
if
the
emperor
has
actually
taken
it
into
his
head
to
let
this
be
summoned
it
were
better
for
you
and
for
all
of
us
that
he
found
him
pilate
answered
irritably
is
it
the
darkness
that
has
turned
you
into
children
one
would
think
that
you
had
all
been
transformed
into
and
but
the
courtier
continued
his
argument
it
may
not
be
impossible
perhaps
to
save
the
man
s
life
if
you
sent
a
swift
you
want
to
make
a
of
me
answered
the
governor
tell
me
what
would
become
of
law
and
order
in
this
land
if
they
learned
that
the
governor
pardoned
a
criminal
because
his
wife
has
dreamed
a
bad
dream
it
is
the
truth
however
and
not
a
dream
that
i
have
seen
faustina
in
jerusalem
said
the
young
orator
i
shall
take
the
responsibility
of
defending
my
actions
before
the
emperor
said
pilate
he
will
understand
that
this
visionary
who
let
himself
be
misused
by
my
soldiers
without
resistance
would
not
have
had
the
power
to
help
as
he
was
speaking
the
house
was
shaken
by
a
noise
like
a
powerful
rolling
thunder
and
an
earthquake
shook
the
ground
the
governor
s
palace
stood
intact
but
during
some
minutes
just
after
the
earthquake
a
terrific
crash
of
crumbling
houses
and
falling
pillars
was
heard
as
soon
as
a
human
voice
could
make
itself
heard
the
governor
called
a
slave
run
out
to
the
place
of
execution
and
command
in
my
name
that
the
prophet
of
nazareth
shall
be
taken
down
from
the
cross
the
slave
hurried
away
the
guests
filed
from
the
out
on
the
peristyle
to
be
under
the
open
sky
in
case
the
earthquake
should
be
repeated
no
one
dared
to
utter
a
word
while
they
awaited
the
slave
s
return
he
came
back
very
shortly
he
stopped
before
the
governor
you
found
him
alive
said
he
master
he
was
dead
and
on
the
very
second
that
he
gave
up
the
ghost
the
earthquake
the
words
were
hardly
spoken
when
two
loud
knocks
sounded
against
the
outer
gate
when
these
knocks
were
heard
they
all
staggered
back
and
leaped
up
as
though
it
had
been
a
new
earthquake
immediately
afterwards
a
slave
came
up
it
is
the
noble
faustina
and
the
emperor
s
kinsman
sulpicius
they
are
come
to
beg
you
help
them
find
the
prophet
from
a
low
murmur
passed
through
the
peristyle
and
soft
footfalls
were
heard
when
the
governor
looked
around
he
noticed
that
his
friends
had
withdrawn
from
him
as
from
one
upon
whom
misfortune
has
fallen
ix
old
faustina
had
returned
to
capri
and
had
sought
out
the
emperor
she
told
him
her
story
and
while
she
spoke
she
hardly
dared
look
at
him
during
her
absence
the
illness
had
made
frightful
ravages
and
she
thought
to
herself
if
there
had
been
any
pity
among
the
celestials
they
would
have
let
me
die
before
being
forced
to
tell
this
poor
tortured
man
that
all
hope
is
to
her
astonishment
tiberius
listened
to
her
with
the
utmost
indifference
when
she
related
how
the
great
miracle
performer
had
been
crucified
the
same
day
that
she
had
arrived
in
jerusalem
and
how
near
she
had
been
to
saving
him
she
began
to
weep
under
the
weight
of
her
failure
but
tiberius
only
remarked
you
actually
grieve
over
this
ah
faustina
a
whole
lifetime
in
rome
has
not
weaned
you
then
of
faith
in
sorcerers
and
miracle
workers
which
you
imbibed
during
your
childhood
in
the
sabine
mountains
then
the
old
woman
perceived
that
tiberius
had
never
expected
any
help
from
the
prophet
of
nazareth
why
did
you
let
me
make
the
journey
to
that
distant
land
if
you
believed
all
the
while
that
it
was
useless
you
are
the
only
friend
i
have
said
the
emperor
why
should
i
deny
your
prayer
so
long
as
i
still
have
the
power
to
grant
but
the
old
woman
did
not
like
it
that
the
emperor
had
taken
her
for
a
fool
ah
this
is
your
usual
cunning
she
burst
out
this
is
just
what
i
can
tolerate
least
in
you
should
not
have
come
back
to
me
said
tiberius
you
should
have
remained
in
the
it
looked
for
a
moment
as
if
these
two
who
had
clashed
so
often
would
again
fall
into
a
war
of
words
but
the
old
woman
s
anger
subsided
immediately
the
times
were
past
when
she
could
quarrel
in
earnest
with
the
emperor
she
lowered
her
voice
again
but
she
could
not
altogether
relinquish
every
effort
to
obtain
justice
but
this
man
was
really
a
prophet
she
said
i
have
seen
him
when
his
eyes
met
mine
i
thought
he
was
a
god
i
was
mad
to
allow
him
to
go
to
his
i
am
glad
you
let
him
die
said
tiberius
he
was
a
traitor
and
a
dangerous
faustina
was
about
to
burst
into
another
checked
herself
i
have
spoken
with
many
of
his
friends
in
jerusalem
about
him
said
she
he
had
not
committed
the
crimes
for
which
he
was
even
if
he
had
not
committed
just
these
crimes
he
was
surely
no
better
than
any
one
else
said
the
emperor
wearily
where
will
you
find
the
person
who
during
his
lifetime
has
not
a
thousand
times
deserved
death
but
these
remarks
of
the
emperor
decided
faustina
to
undertake
something
which
she
had
until
now
hesitated
about
i
will
show
you
a
proof
of
his
power
said
she
i
said
to
you
just
now
that
i
laid
my
kerchief
over
his
face
it
is
the
same
kerchief
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
will
you
look
at
it
a
moment
she
spread
the
kerchief
out
before
the
emperor
and
he
saw
delineated
thereon
the
shadowy
likeness
of
a
human
face
the
old
woman
s
voice
shook
with
emotion
as
she
continued
this
man
saw
that
i
loved
him
i
know
not
by
what
power
he
was
enabled
to
leave
me
his
portrait
but
mine
eyes
fill
up
with
tears
when
i
see
the
emperor
leaned
forward
and
regarded
the
picture
which
appeared
to
be
made
up
of
blood
and
tears
and
the
dark
shadows
of
grief
gradually
the
whole
face
stood
out
before
him
exactly
as
it
had
been
imprinted
upon
the
kerchief
he
saw
the
on
the
forehead
the
piercing
the
hair
which
was
matted
with
blood
and
the
mouth
whose
lips
seemed
to
quiver
with
agony
he
bent
down
closer
and
closer
to
the
picture
the
face
stood
out
clearer
and
clearer
from
out
the
outlines
all
at
once
he
saw
the
eyes
sparkle
as
with
hidden
life
and
while
they
spoke
to
him
of
the
most
terrible
suffering
they
also
revealed
a
purity
and
sublimity
which
he
had
never
seen
before
he
lay
upon
his
couch
and
drank
in
the
picture
with
his
eyes
is
this
a
mortal
he
said
softly
and
slowly
is
this
a
mortal
again
he
lay
still
and
regarded
the
picture
the
tears
began
to
stream
down
his
cheeks
i
mourn
over
thy
death
thou
unknown
he
whispered
faustina
he
cried
out
at
last
why
did
you
let
this
man
die
he
would
have
healed
and
again
he
was
lost
in
the
picture
o
man
he
said
after
a
moment
if
i
can
not
gain
my
health
from
thee
i
can
still
avenge
thy
murder
my
hand
shall
rest
heavily
upon
those
who
have
robbed
me
of
thee
again
he
lay
still
a
long
time
then
he
let
himself
glide
down
to
the
he
knelt
before
the
picture
thou
art
man
said
he
thou
art
that
which
i
never
dreamed
i
should
and
he
pointed
to
his
disfigured
face
and
destroyed
hands
i
and
all
others
are
wild
beasts
and
monsters
but
thou
art
he
bowed
his
head
so
low
before
the
picture
that
it
touched
the
floor
have
pity
on
me
thou
unknown
he
sobbed
and
his
tears
watered
the
stones
if
thou
hadst
lived
thy
glance
alone
would
have
healed
me
he
said
the
poor
old
woman
was
over
what
she
had
done
it
would
have
been
wiser
not
to
show
the
emperor
the
picture
thought
she
from
the
start
she
had
been
afraid
that
if
he
should
see
it
his
grief
would
be
too
overwhelming
and
in
her
despair
over
the
emperor
s
grief
she
snatched
the
picture
away
as
if
to
remove
it
from
his
sight
then
the
emperor
looked
up
and
lo
his
features
were
transformed
and
he
was
as
he
had
been
before
the
illness
it
was
as
if
the
illness
had
had
its
root
and
sustenance
in
the
contempt
and
hatred
of
mankind
which
had
lived
in
his
heart
and
it
had
been
forced
to
flee
the
very
moment
he
had
felt
love
and
compassion
the
following
day
tiberius
despatched
three
messengers
the
first
messenger
traveled
to
rome
with
the
command
that
the
senate
should
institute
investigations
as
to
how
the
governor
of
palestine
administered
his
official
duties
and
punish
him
should
it
appear
that
he
oppressed
the
people
and
condemned
the
innocent
to
death
the
second
messenger
went
to
the
and
his
wife
to
thank
them
and
reward
them
for
the
counsel
they
had
given
the
emperor
and
also
to
tell
them
how
everything
had
turned
out
when
they
had
heard
all
they
wept
silently
and
the
man
said
i
know
that
all
my
life
i
shall
ponder
what
would
have
happened
if
these
two
had
but
the
woman
answered
it
could
not
happen
in
any
other
way
it
was
too
great
a
thought
that
these
two
should
meet
god
knew
that
the
world
could
not
support
the
third
messenger
traveled
to
palestine
and
brought
back
with
him
to
capri
some
of
jesus
disciples
and
these
began
to
teach
there
the
doctrine
that
had
been
preached
by
the
crucified
one
when
the
disciples
landed
at
capri
old
faustina
lay
upon
her
still
they
had
time
before
her
death
to
make
of
her
a
follower
of
the
great
prophet
and
to
baptize
her
and
in
the
baptism
she
was
called
veronica
because
to
her
it
had
been
granted
to
give
to
mankind
the
true
likeness
of
their
saviour
illustration
robin
redbreast
robin
redbreast
it
happened
at
the
time
when
our
lord
created
the
world
when
he
not
only
made
heaven
and
earth
but
all
the
animals
and
the
plants
as
well
at
the
same
time
giving
them
their
names
there
have
been
many
histories
concerning
that
time
and
if
we
knew
them
all
we
should
have
light
upon
everything
in
this
world
which
we
can
not
now
comprehend
at
that
time
it
happened
one
day
when
our
lord
sat
in
his
paradise
and
painted
the
little
birds
that
the
colors
in
our
lord
s
paint
pot
gave
out
and
the
goldfinch
would
have
been
without
color
if
our
lord
had
not
wiped
all
his
paint
brushes
on
its
feathers
it
was
then
that
the
donkey
got
his
long
ears
because
he
could
not
remember
the
name
that
had
been
given
him
no
sooner
had
he
taken
a
few
steps
over
the
meadows
of
paradise
than
he
forgot
and
three
times
he
came
back
to
ask
his
name
at
last
our
lord
grew
somewhat
impatient
took
him
by
his
two
ears
and
said
thy
name
is
ass
ass
ass
and
while
he
thus
spake
our
lord
pulled
both
of
his
ears
that
the
ass
might
hear
better
and
remember
what
was
said
to
him
it
was
on
the
same
day
also
that
the
bee
was
punished
now
when
the
bee
was
created
she
began
immediately
to
gather
honey
and
the
animals
and
human
beings
who
caught
the
delicious
odor
of
the
honey
came
and
wanted
to
taste
of
it
but
the
bee
wanted
to
keep
it
all
for
herself
and
with
her
poisonous
sting
pursued
every
living
creature
that
approached
her
hive
our
lord
saw
this
and
at
once
called
the
bee
to
him
and
punished
her
i
gave
thee
the
gift
of
gathering
honey
which
is
the
sweetest
thing
in
all
creation
said
our
lord
but
i
did
not
give
thee
the
right
to
be
cruel
to
thy
neighbor
remember
well
that
every
time
thou
stingest
any
creature
who
desires
to
taste
of
thy
honey
thou
shalt
surely
die
ah
yes
it
was
at
that
time
too
that
the
cricket
became
blind
and
the
ant
missed
her
wings
so
many
strange
things
happened
on
that
day
our
lord
sat
there
big
and
gentle
and
planned
and
created
all
day
long
and
towards
evening
he
conceived
the
idea
of
making
a
little
gray
bird
remember
your
name
is
robin
redbreast
said
our
lord
to
the
bird
as
soon
as
it
was
finished
then
he
held
it
in
the
palm
of
his
open
hand
and
let
it
fly
after
the
bird
had
been
testing
his
wings
a
while
and
had
seen
something
of
the
beautiful
world
in
which
he
was
destined
to
live
he
became
curious
to
see
what
he
himself
was
like
he
noticed
that
he
was
entirely
gray
and
that
his
breast
was
just
as
gray
as
all
the
rest
of
him
robin
redbreast
twisted
and
turned
in
all
directions
as
he
viewed
himself
in
the
mirror
of
a
clear
lake
but
he
couldn
t
find
a
single
red
feather
then
he
flew
back
to
our
lord
our
lord
sat
there
on
his
throne
big
and
gentle
out
of
his
hands
came
butterflies
that
fluttered
about
his
head
doves
cooed
on
his
shoulders
and
out
of
the
earth
beneath
him
grew
the
rose
the
lily
and
the
daisy
the
little
bird
s
heart
beat
heavily
with
fright
but
with
easy
curves
he
flew
nearer
and
nearer
our
lord
till
at
last
he
rested
on
our
lord
s
hand
then
our
lord
asked
what
the
little
bird
wanted
i
only
wish
to
ask
you
about
one
thing
said
the
little
bird
what
is
it
you
wish
to
know
said
our
lord
why
should
i
be
called
red
breast
when
i
am
all
gray
from
the
bill
to
the
very
end
of
my
tail
why
am
i
called
red
breast
when
i
do
not
possess
one
single
red
feather
the
bird
looked
beseechingly
on
our
lord
with
his
tiny
black
turned
his
head
about
him
he
saw
pheasants
all
red
under
a
sprinkle
of
gold
dust
parrots
with
marvelous
red
cocks
with
red
combs
to
say
nothing
about
the
butterflies
the
goldfinches
and
the
roses
and
naturally
he
thought
how
little
he
one
tiny
drop
of
color
on
his
breast
and
he
too
would
be
a
beautiful
bird
and
his
name
would
fit
him
why
should
i
be
called
red
breast
when
i
am
so
entirely
gray
asked
the
bird
once
again
and
waited
for
our
lord
to
say
ah
my
friend
i
see
that
i
have
forgotten
to
paint
your
breast
feathers
red
but
wait
a
moment
and
it
shall
be
but
our
lord
only
smiled
a
little
and
said
i
have
called
you
robin
redbreast
and
robin
redbreast
shall
your
name
be
but
you
must
look
to
it
that
you
yourself
earn
your
red
breast
then
our
lord
lifted
his
hand
and
let
the
bird
fly
once
into
the
world
the
bird
flew
down
into
paradise
meditating
deeply
what
could
a
little
bird
like
him
do
to
earn
for
himself
red
feathers
the
only
thing
he
could
think
of
was
to
make
his
nest
in
a
brier
bush
he
built
it
in
among
the
thorns
in
the
close
thicket
it
looked
as
if
he
waited
for
a
rose
leaf
to
cling
to
his
throat
and
give
him
color
countless
years
had
come
and
gone
since
that
day
which
was
the
happiest
in
all
the
world
human
beings
had
already
advanced
so
far
that
they
had
learned
to
cultivate
the
earth
and
sail
the
seas
they
had
procured
clothes
and
ornaments
for
themselves
and
had
long
since
learned
to
build
big
temples
and
great
as
thebes
rome
and
jerusalem
then
there
dawned
a
day
one
that
will
long
be
remembered
in
the
world
s
history
on
the
morning
of
this
day
robin
redbreast
sat
upon
a
little
naked
hillock
outside
of
jerusalem
s
walls
and
sang
to
his
young
ones
who
rested
in
a
tiny
nest
in
a
brier
bush
robin
redbreast
told
the
little
ones
all
about
that
wonderful
day
of
creation
and
how
the
lord
had
given
names
to
everything
just
as
each
redbreast
had
told
it
ever
since
the
first
redbreast
had
heard
god
s
word
and
gone
out
of
god
s
hand
and
mark
you
he
ended
sorrowfully
so
many
years
have
gone
so
many
roses
have
bloomed
so
many
little
birds
have
come
out
of
their
eggs
since
creation
day
but
robin
redbreast
is
still
a
little
gray
bird
he
has
not
yet
succeeded
in
gaining
his
red
the
little
young
ones
opened
wide
their
tiny
bills
and
asked
if
their
forbears
had
never
tried
to
do
any
great
thing
to
earn
the
priceless
red
color
we
have
all
done
what
we
could
said
the
little
bird
but
we
have
all
gone
amiss
even
the
first
robin
redbreast
met
one
day
another
bird
exactly
like
himself
and
he
began
immediately
to
love
it
with
such
a
mighty
love
that
he
could
feel
his
breast
burn
ah
he
thought
then
now
i
understand
it
was
our
lord
s
meaning
that
i
should
love
with
so
much
ardor
that
my
breast
should
grow
red
in
color
from
the
very
warmth
of
the
love
that
lives
in
my
but
he
missed
it
as
all
those
who
came
after
him
have
missed
it
and
as
even
you
shall
miss
the
little
young
ones
twittered
utterly
bewildered
and
already
began
to
mourn
because
the
red
color
would
not
come
to
beautify
their
little
downy
gray
breasts
we
had
also
hoped
that
song
would
help
us
said
the
bird
speaking
in
the
first
robin
redbreast
sang
until
his
heart
swelled
within
him
he
was
so
carried
away
and
he
dared
to
hope
anew
ah
he
thought
it
is
the
glow
of
the
song
which
lives
in
my
soul
that
will
color
my
breast
feathers
but
he
missed
it
as
all
the
others
have
missed
it
and
as
even
you
shall
miss
again
was
heard
a
sad
peep
from
the
young
ones
throats
we
had
also
counted
on
our
courage
and
our
valor
said
the
bird
the
first
robin
redbreast
fought
bravely
with
other
birds
until
his
breast
flamed
with
the
pride
of
conquest
ah
he
thought
my
breast
feathers
shall
become
red
from
the
love
of
battle
which
burns
in
my
he
too
missed
it
as
all
those
who
came
after
him
have
missed
it
and
as
even
you
shall
miss
the
little
young
ones
peeped
courageously
that
they
still
wished
to
try
and
win
the
prize
but
the
bird
answered
them
sorrowfully
that
it
would
be
impossible
what
could
they
do
when
so
many
splendid
ancestors
had
missed
the
mark
what
could
they
do
more
than
love
sing
and
fight
what
little
bird
stopped
short
for
out
of
one
of
the
gates
of
jerusalem
came
a
crowd
of
people
marching
and
the
whole
procession
rushed
toward
the
hillock
where
the
bird
had
its
nest
there
were
riders
on
proud
horses
soldiers
with
long
spears
executioners
with
nails
and
hammers
there
were
judges
and
priests
in
the
procession
weeping
women
and
above
all
a
mob
of
mad
loose
people
running
filthy
howling
mob
of
loiterers
the
little
gray
bird
sat
trembling
on
the
edge
of
his
nest
he
feared
each
instant
that
the
little
brier
bush
would
be
trampled
down
and
his
young
ones
killed
be
careful
he
cried
to
the
little
defenseless
young
ones
creep
together
and
remain
quiet
here
comes
a
horse
that
will
ride
right
over
us
here
comes
a
warrior
with
sandals
here
comes
the
whole
wild
storming
mob
immediately
the
bird
ceased
his
cry
of
warning
and
grew
calm
and
quiet
he
almost
forgot
the
danger
hovering
over
him
finally
he
hopped
down
into
the
nest
and
spread
his
wings
over
the
young
ones
oh
this
is
too
terrible
said
he
i
don
t
wish
you
to
witness
this
awful
sight
there
are
three
miscreants
who
are
going
to
be
crucified
and
he
spread
his
wings
so
that
the
little
ones
could
see
nothing
they
caught
only
the
sound
of
hammers
the
cries
of
anguish
and
the
wild
shrieks
of
the
mob
robin
redbreast
followed
the
whole
spectacle
with
his
eyes
which
grew
big
with
terror
he
could
not
take
his
glance
from
the
three
unfortunates
how
terrible
human
beings
are
said
the
bird
after
a
little
while
it
isn
t
enough
that
they
nail
these
poor
creatures
to
a
cross
but
they
must
needs
place
a
crown
of
piercing
thorns
upon
the
head
of
one
of
them
i
see
that
the
thorns
have
wounded
his
brow
so
that
the
blood
flows
he
continued
and
this
man
is
so
beautiful
and
looks
about
him
with
such
mild
glances
that
every
one
ought
to
love
him
i
feel
as
if
an
arrow
were
shooting
through
my
heart
when
i
see
him
suffer
the
little
bird
began
to
feel
a
stronger
and
stronger
pity
for
the
sufferer
oh
if
i
were
only
my
brother
the
eagle
thought
he
i
would
draw
the
nails
from
his
hands
and
with
my
strong
claws
i
would
drive
away
all
those
who
torture
him
he
saw
how
the
blood
trickled
down
from
the
brow
of
the
crucified
one
and
he
could
no
longer
remain
quiet
in
his
nest
even
if
i
am
little
and
weak
i
can
still
do
something
for
this
poor
tortured
one
thought
the
bird
then
he
left
his
nest
and
flew
out
into
the
air
striking
wide
circles
around
the
crucified
one
he
flew
around
him
several
times
without
daring
to
approach
for
he
was
a
shy
little
bird
who
had
never
dared
to
go
near
a
human
being
but
little
by
little
he
gained
courage
flew
close
to
him
and
drew
with
his
little
bill
a
thorn
that
had
become
imbedded
in
the
brow
of
the
crucified
one
and
as
he
did
this
there
fell
on
his
breast
a
drop
of
blood
from
the
face
of
the
crucified
one
spread
quickly
and
floated
out
and
colored
all
the
little
fine
breast
feathers
then
the
crucified
one
opened
his
lips
and
whispered
to
the
bird
because
of
thy
compassion
thou
hast
won
all
that
thy
kind
have
been
striving
after
ever
since
the
world
was
as
soon
as
the
bird
had
returned
to
his
nest
his
young
ones
cried
to
him
thy
breast
is
red
thy
breast
feathers
are
redder
than
the
roses
it
is
only
a
drop
of
blood
from
the
poor
man
s
forehead
said
the
bird
it
will
vanish
as
soon
as
i
bathe
in
a
pool
or
a
clear
but
no
matter
how
much
the
little
bird
bathed
the
red
color
did
not
when
his
little
young
ones
grew
up
the
color
shone
also
on
their
breast
feathers
just
as
it
shines
on
every
robin
redbreast
s
throat
and
breast
until
this
very
day
illustration
our
lord
and
saint
peter
our
lord
and
saint
peter
it
happened
at
the
time
when
our
lord
and
saint
peter
were
newly
arrived
in
paradise
after
having
wandered
on
earth
and
suffered
hardships
during
many
sorrowful
years
one
can
imagine
that
the
change
was
a
joy
to
saint
peter
one
can
picture
to
oneself
that
it
was
quite
another
matter
to
sit
upon
paradise
mountain
and
look
out
over
the
world
instead
of
wandering
from
door
to
door
like
a
beggar
it
was
another
matter
to
walk
about
in
the
beautiful
gardens
of
paradise
instead
of
roaming
around
on
earth
not
knowing
if
one
would
be
given
on
a
stormy
night
or
if
one
would
be
forced
to
tramp
the
highway
in
the
chill
and
darkness
one
can
imagine
what
a
joy
it
must
have
been
to
get
to
the
right
place
at
last
after
such
a
journey
saint
peter
to
be
sure
had
not
always
been
certain
that
all
would
end
well
he
couldn
t
very
well
help
feeling
doubtful
and
troubled
at
times
for
it
had
been
almost
impossible
for
poor
saint
peter
to
understand
why
there
was
any
earthly
need
for
them
to
have
such
a
hard
time
of
it
if
our
lord
was
lord
of
all
the
world
now
no
yearning
could
come
to
torment
him
any
more
that
he
was
glad
of
this
one
can
well
believe
now
he
could
actually
laugh
at
all
the
misery
which
he
and
our
lord
had
been
forced
to
endure
and
at
the
little
that
they
had
been
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
once
when
things
had
turned
out
so
badly
for
them
that
saint
peter
thought
he
couldn
t
stand
it
any
longer
our
lord
had
taken
him
to
a
high
mountain
and
had
begun
the
ascent
without
telling
him
what
they
were
there
for
they
had
wandered
past
the
cities
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
the
castles
higher
up
they
had
gone
past
the
farms
and
cabins
and
had
left
behind
them
the
last
s
cave
they
had
come
at
last
to
the
part
where
the
mountain
stood
naked
without
verdure
and
trees
and
where
a
hermit
had
built
him
a
hut
wherein
he
might
shelter
needy
travelers
afterward
they
had
walked
over
the
snowfields
where
the
sleep
and
come
to
the
ice
masses
which
stood
on
edge
and
and
where
scarcely
a
chamois
could
pass
up
there
our
lord
had
found
a
little
bird
that
lay
frozen
to
death
on
the
ice
and
he
had
picked
up
the
bullfinch
and
tucked
it
in
his
bosom
and
saint
peter
remembered
he
had
wondered
if
this
was
to
be
their
dinner
they
had
wandered
a
long
while
on
the
slippery
and
it
had
seemed
to
saint
peter
that
he
had
never
been
so
near
perdition
for
a
deadly
cold
wind
and
a
deadly
dark
mist
enveloped
them
and
as
far
as
he
could
discover
there
wasn
t
a
living
thing
to
be
found
and
still
they
were
only
up
the
mountain
then
he
begged
our
lord
to
let
him
turn
back
not
yet
said
our
lord
for
i
want
to
show
you
something
which
will
give
you
courage
to
meet
all
for
this
they
had
gone
on
through
mist
and
cold
until
they
had
reached
an
interminably
high
wall
which
prevented
them
from
going
farther
this
wall
extends
all
around
the
mountain
said
our
lord
and
you
can
t
step
over
it
at
any
point
nor
can
any
living
creature
see
anything
of
that
which
lies
behind
it
for
it
is
here
that
paradise
begins
and
all
the
way
up
to
the
mountain
s
summit
live
the
blessed
but
saint
peter
couldn
t
help
looking
doubtful
in
there
is
neither
darkness
nor
cold
said
our
lord
but
there
it
is
always
summer
with
the
bright
light
of
suns
and
but
saint
peter
was
not
able
to
persuade
himself
to
believe
this
then
our
lord
took
the
little
bird
which
he
had
just
found
on
the
ice
and
bending
backwards
threw
it
over
the
wall
so
that
it
fell
down
into
paradise
and
immediately
thereafter
saint
peter
heard
a
loud
joyous
trill
and
recognized
a
bullfinch
s
song
and
was
greatly
astonished
he
turned
toward
our
lord
and
said
let
us
return
to
the
earth
and
suffer
all
that
must
be
suffered
for
now
i
see
that
you
speak
the
truth
and
that
there
is
a
place
where
life
overcomes
and
they
descended
from
the
mountain
and
began
their
wanderings
again
and
it
was
years
before
saint
peter
saw
any
more
than
this
one
glimpse
of
paradise
but
he
had
always
longed
for
the
land
beyond
the
wall
and
now
at
last
he
was
there
and
did
not
have
to
strive
and
yearn
any
more
now
he
could
drink
bliss
in
full
measure
all
day
long
from
streams
but
saint
peter
had
not
been
in
paradise
a
fortnight
before
it
happened
that
an
angel
came
to
our
lord
where
he
sat
upon
his
throne
bowed
seven
times
before
him
and
told
him
that
a
great
sorrow
must
have
come
upon
saint
peter
he
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
and
his
eyelids
were
red
as
though
he
had
not
slept
for
several
nights
as
soon
as
our
lord
heard
this
he
rose
and
went
to
seek
saint
peter
he
found
him
far
away
on
one
of
the
outskirts
of
paradise
where
he
lay
upon
the
ground
as
if
he
were
too
exhausted
to
stand
and
he
had
rent
his
garments
and
strewn
his
hair
with
ashes
when
our
lord
saw
him
so
distressed
he
sat
down
on
the
ground
beside
him
and
talked
to
him
just
as
he
would
have
done
had
they
still
been
wandering
around
in
this
world
of
trouble
what
is
it
that
makes
you
so
sad
saint
peter
said
our
lord
but
grief
had
overpowered
saint
peter
so
that
he
could
not
answer
what
is
it
that
makes
you
so
sad
asked
our
lord
once
again
when
our
lord
repeated
the
question
saint
peter
took
the
gold
crown
from
his
head
and
threw
it
at
our
lord
s
feet
as
much
as
to
say
he
wanted
no
further
share
in
his
honor
and
glory
but
our
lord
understood
of
course
that
saint
peter
was
so
disconsolate
that
he
knew
not
what
he
did
he
showed
no
anger
at
him
you
must
tell
me
what
troubles
you
said
he
just
as
gently
as
before
and
with
an
even
greater
love
in
his
voice
but
now
saint
peter
jumped
up
and
then
our
lord
knew
that
he
was
not
only
disconsolate
but
downright
angry
he
came
toward
our
lord
with
clenched
fists
and
snapping
eyes
now
i
want
a
dismissal
from
your
service
said
saint
peter
i
can
not
remain
another
day
in
our
lord
tried
to
calm
him
just
as
he
had
been
obliged
to
do
many
times
before
when
saint
peter
had
flared
up
oh
certainly
you
can
go
said
he
but
you
must
first
tell
me
what
it
is
that
displeases
i
can
tell
you
that
i
awaited
a
better
reward
than
this
when
we
two
endured
all
sorts
of
misery
down
on
earth
said
saint
peter
our
lord
saw
that
saint
peter
s
soul
was
filled
with
bitterness
and
he
felt
no
anger
at
him
i
tell
you
that
you
are
free
to
go
whither
you
will
said
he
if
you
will
only
let
me
know
what
is
troubling
then
at
last
saint
peter
told
our
lord
why
he
was
so
unhappy
i
had
an
old
mother
said
he
and
she
died
a
few
days
now
i
know
what
distresses
you
said
our
lord
you
suffer
because
your
mother
has
not
come
into
that
is
true
said
saint
peter
and
at
the
same
time
his
grief
became
so
overwhelming
that
he
began
to
sob
and
moan
i
think
i
deserved
at
least
that
she
should
be
permitted
to
come
here
said
he
but
when
our
lord
learned
what
it
was
that
saint
peter
was
grieving
over
he
in
turn
became
distressed
saint
peter
s
mother
had
not
been
such
that
she
could
enter
the
heavenly
kingdom
she
had
never
thought
of
anything
except
to
hoard
money
and
to
the
poor
who
had
knocked
at
her
door
she
had
never
given
so
much
as
a
copper
or
a
crust
of
bread
but
our
lord
understood
that
it
was
impossible
for
saint
peter
to
grasp
the
fact
that
his
mother
had
been
so
greedy
that
she
was
not
entitled
to
bliss
saint
peter
said
he
how
can
you
be
so
sure
that
your
mother
would
feel
at
home
here
with
us
you
say
such
things
only
that
you
may
not
have
to
listen
to
my
prayers
said
saint
peter
who
wouldn
t
be
happy
in
paradise
one
who
does
not
feel
joy
over
the
happiness
of
others
can
not
rest
content
here
said
our
lord
then
there
are
others
than
my
mother
who
do
not
belong
here
said
saint
peter
and
our
lord
observed
that
he
was
thinking
of
him
and
he
felt
deeply
grieved
because
saint
peter
had
been
stricken
with
such
a
heavy
sorrow
that
he
no
longer
knew
what
he
said
he
stood
a
moment
and
expected
that
saint
peter
would
repent
and
understand
that
his
mother
was
not
fit
for
paradise
but
the
saint
would
not
give
in
then
our
lord
called
an
angel
and
commanded
that
he
should
fly
down
into
hell
and
bring
saint
peter
s
mother
to
paradise
let
me
see
how
he
carries
her
said
saint
peter
our
lord
took
saint
peter
by
the
hand
and
led
him
out
to
a
steep
precipice
which
leaned
slantingly
to
one
side
and
he
showed
him
that
he
only
had
to
lean
over
the
precipice
very
very
little
to
be
able
to
look
down
into
hell
when
saint
peter
glanced
down
he
could
not
at
first
see
anything
more
than
if
he
had
looked
into
a
deep
well
it
was
as
though
an
endless
chasm
opened
under
him
the
first
thing
which
he
could
faintly
distinguish
was
the
angel
who
had
already
started
on
his
way
to
the
nether
regions
saint
peter
saw
how
the
angel
dived
down
into
the
great
darkness
without
the
least
fear
and
spread
his
wings
just
a
little
so
as
not
to
descend
too
rapidly
but
when
saint
peter
s
eyes
had
become
a
little
more
used
to
the
darkness
he
began
to
see
more
and
more
in
the
first
place
he
saw
that
paradise
lay
on
a
which
encircled
a
wide
chasm
and
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
chasm
that
the
souls
of
the
sinful
had
their
abode
he
saw
how
the
angel
sank
and
sank
a
long
while
without
reaching
the
depths
he
became
absolutely
terrified
because
it
was
such
a
long
distance
down
there
may
he
only
come
up
again
with
my
mother
said
he
our
lord
only
looked
at
saint
peter
with
great
sorrowful
eyes
there
is
no
weight
too
heavy
for
my
angel
to
carry
said
he
it
was
so
far
down
to
the
nether
regions
that
no
ray
of
sunlight
could
penetrate
thither
there
darkness
reigned
but
it
was
as
if
the
angel
in
his
flight
must
have
brought
with
him
a
little
clearness
and
light
so
that
it
was
possible
for
saint
peter
to
see
how
it
looked
down
there
it
was
an
endless
black
sharp
pointed
rocks
covered
the
entire
foundation
there
was
not
a
green
blade
not
a
tree
not
a
sign
of
life
but
all
over
on
the
sharp
rocks
were
condemned
souls
they
hung
over
the
edges
whither
they
had
clambered
that
they
might
swing
themselves
up
from
the
ravine
and
when
they
saw
that
they
could
get
nowhere
they
remained
up
there
petrified
with
anguish
saint
peter
saw
some
of
them
sit
or
lie
with
arms
extended
in
ceaseless
longing
and
with
eyes
fixedly
turned
upwards
others
had
covered
their
faces
with
their
hands
as
if
they
would
shut
out
the
hopeless
horror
around
them
they
were
all
rigid
there
was
not
one
among
them
who
had
the
power
to
move
some
lay
in
the
perfectly
still
without
trying
to
rise
from
them
but
the
most
dreadful
thing
of
all
was
such
a
great
throng
of
the
lost
it
was
as
though
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
were
made
up
of
nothing
but
bodies
and
heads
and
saint
peter
was
struck
with
a
new
fear
you
shall
see
that
he
will
not
find
her
said
he
to
our
lord
once
more
our
lord
looked
at
him
with
the
same
grieved
expression
he
knew
of
course
that
saint
peter
did
not
need
to
be
uneasy
about
the
angel
but
to
saint
peter
it
looked
all
the
while
as
if
the
angel
could
not
find
his
mother
in
that
great
company
of
lost
souls
he
spread
his
wings
and
flew
back
and
forth
over
the
nether
regions
while
he
sought
her
suddenly
one
of
the
poor
lost
creatures
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
angel
and
he
sprang
up
and
stretched
his
arms
towards
him
and
cried
take
me
with
you
take
me
with
you
then
all
at
once
the
whole
throng
was
alive
all
the
millions
upon
millions
who
languished
in
hell
roused
themselves
that
instant
and
raised
their
arms
and
cried
to
the
angel
that
he
should
take
them
with
him
to
the
blessed
paradise
their
shrieks
were
heard
all
the
way
up
to
our
lord
and
saint
peter
whose
hearts
throbbed
with
anguish
as
they
heard
the
angel
swayed
high
above
the
condemned
but
as
he
traveled
back
and
forth
to
find
the
one
whom
he
sought
they
all
rushed
after
him
so
that
it
looked
as
though
they
had
been
swept
on
by
a
whirlwind
at
last
the
angel
caught
sight
of
the
one
he
was
to
take
with
him
he
folded
his
wings
over
his
back
and
shot
down
like
a
streak
of
lightning
and
the
astonished
saint
peter
gave
a
cry
of
joy
when
he
saw
the
angel
place
an
arm
around
his
mother
and
lift
her
up
blessed
be
thou
that
bringest
my
mother
to
me
said
he
our
lord
laid
his
hand
gently
on
saint
peter
s
shoulder
as
if
he
would
warn
him
not
to
abandon
himself
to
joy
too
soon
but
saint
peter
was
ready
to
weep
for
joy
because
his
mother
was
saved
he
could
not
understand
that
anything
further
would
have
the
power
to
part
them
and
his
joy
increased
when
he
saw
that
quick
as
the
angel
had
been
when
he
had
lifted
her
up
still
several
of
the
lost
souls
had
succeeded
in
attaching
themselves
to
her
who
was
to
be
saved
in
order
that
they
too
might
be
borne
to
paradise
with
her
there
must
have
been
a
dozen
who
clung
to
the
old
woman
and
saint
peter
thought
it
was
a
great
honor
for
his
mother
to
help
so
many
poor
unfortunate
beings
out
of
perdition
nor
did
the
angel
do
aught
to
hinder
them
he
seemed
not
at
all
troubled
with
his
burden
but
rose
and
rose
and
moved
his
wings
with
no
more
effort
than
if
he
were
carrying
a
little
dead
birdling
to
heaven
but
then
saint
peter
saw
that
his
mother
began
to
free
herself
from
the
lost
souls
that
had
clung
to
her
she
gripped
their
hands
and
loosened
their
hold
so
that
one
after
another
tumbled
down
into
hell
saint
peter
could
hear
how
they
begged
and
implored
her
but
the
old
woman
did
not
desire
that
any
one
but
herself
should
be
saved
she
freed
herself
from
more
and
more
of
them
and
let
them
fall
down
into
misery
and
as
they
fell
all
space
was
filled
with
their
lamentations
and
curses
then
saint
peter
begged
and
implored
his
mother
to
show
some
compassion
but
she
would
not
listen
and
kept
right
on
as
before
and
saint
peter
saw
how
the
angel
flew
slower
and
slower
the
lighter
his
burden
became
such
fear
took
hold
of
saint
peter
that
his
legs
shook
and
he
was
forced
to
drop
on
his
knees
finally
there
was
only
one
condemned
soul
who
still
clung
to
peter
s
mother
this
was
a
young
woman
who
hung
on
her
neck
and
begged
and
cried
in
her
ear
that
she
would
let
her
go
along
with
her
to
the
blessed
paradise
the
angel
with
his
burden
had
already
come
so
far
that
saint
peter
stretched
out
his
arms
to
receive
his
mother
he
thought
that
the
angel
had
to
make
only
two
or
three
more
to
reach
the
mountain
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
angel
held
his
wings
perfectly
still
and
his
countenance
became
dark
as
night
for
now
the
old
woman
had
stretched
her
hands
back
of
her
and
gripped
the
arms
of
the
young
woman
who
hung
about
her
neck
and
she
clutched
and
tore
until
she
succeeded
in
separating
the
clasped
hands
so
that
she
was
free
from
this
last
one
also
when
the
condemned
one
fell
the
angel
sank
several
fathoms
lower
and
it
appeared
as
though
he
had
not
the
strength
to
lift
his
wings
again
he
looked
down
upon
the
old
woman
with
a
deep
sorrowful
glance
his
hold
around
her
waist
loosened
and
he
let
her
fall
as
if
she
were
too
heavy
a
burden
for
him
now
that
she
was
alone
thereupon
he
swung
himself
with
a
single
stroke
up
into
paradise
but
saint
peter
lay
for
a
long
while
in
the
same
place
and
sobbed
and
our
lord
stood
silent
beside
him
saint
peter
said
our
lord
at
last
i
never
thought
that
you
would
weep
like
this
after
you
had
reached
then
god
s
old
servant
raised
his
head
and
answered
what
kind
of
a
paradise
is
this
where
i
can
hear
the
moans
of
my
dearest
ones
and
see
the
sufferings
of
my
fellow
men
the
face
of
our
lord
became
o
ercast
by
the
deepest
sorrow
what
did
i
desire
more
than
to
prepare
a
paradise
for
all
of
nothing
but
light
and
happiness
he
said
do
you
not
understand
that
it
was
because
of
this
i
went
down
among
men
and
taught
them
to
love
their
neighbors
as
themselves
for
as
long
as
they
do
this
not
there
will
be
no
refuge
in
heaven
or
on
earth
where
pain
and
sorrow
can
not
reach
illustration
the
sacred
flame
the
sacred
flame
i
a
great
many
years
ago
when
the
city
of
florence
had
only
just
been
made
a
republic
a
man
lived
there
named
raniero
di
raniero
he
was
the
son
of
an
armorer
and
had
learned
his
father
s
trade
but
he
did
not
care
much
to
pursue
it
this
raniero
was
the
strongest
of
men
it
was
said
of
him
that
he
bore
a
heavy
iron
armor
as
lightly
as
others
wear
a
silk
shirt
he
was
still
a
young
man
but
already
he
had
given
many
proofs
of
his
strength
once
he
was
in
a
house
where
grain
was
stored
in
the
loft
too
much
grain
had
been
heaped
there
and
while
raniero
was
in
the
house
one
of
the
loft
beams
broke
down
and
the
whole
roof
was
about
to
fall
in
he
raised
his
arms
and
held
the
roof
up
until
the
people
managed
to
fetch
beams
and
poles
to
prop
it
it
was
also
said
of
raniero
that
he
was
the
bravest
man
that
had
ever
lived
in
florence
and
that
he
could
never
get
enough
of
fighting
as
soon
as
he
heard
any
noise
in
the
street
he
rushed
out
from
the
workshop
in
hopes
that
a
fight
had
arisen
in
which
he
might
participate
if
he
could
only
distinguish
himself
he
fought
just
as
readily
with
humble
peasants
as
with
armored
horsemen
he
rushed
into
a
fight
like
a
lunatic
without
counting
his
opponents
florence
was
not
very
powerful
in
his
time
the
people
were
mostly
wool
spinners
and
cloth
weavers
and
these
asked
nothing
better
than
to
be
allowed
to
perform
their
tasks
in
peace
sturdy
men
were
plentiful
but
they
were
not
quarrelsome
and
they
were
proud
of
the
fact
that
in
their
city
better
order
prevailed
than
elsewhere
raniero
often
grumbled
because
he
was
not
born
in
a
country
where
there
was
a
king
who
gathered
around
him
valiant
men
and
declared
that
in
such
an
event
he
would
have
attained
great
honor
and
renown
raniero
was
and
boastful
cruel
to
animals
harsh
toward
his
wife
and
not
good
for
any
one
to
live
with
he
would
have
been
handsome
if
he
had
not
had
several
deep
scars
across
his
face
which
disfigured
him
he
was
quick
to
jump
at
conclusions
and
quick
to
act
though
his
way
was
often
violent
raniero
was
married
to
francesca
who
was
the
daughter
of
jacopo
degli
uberti
a
wise
and
influential
man
jacopo
had
not
been
very
anxious
to
give
his
daughter
to
such
a
bully
as
raniero
but
had
opposed
the
marriage
until
the
very
last
francesca
forced
him
to
relent
by
declaring
that
she
would
never
marry
any
one
else
when
jacopo
finally
gave
his
consent
he
said
to
raniero
i
have
observed
that
men
like
you
can
more
easily
win
a
woman
s
love
than
keep
it
therefore
i
shall
exact
this
promise
from
you
if
my
daughter
finds
life
with
you
so
hard
that
she
wishes
to
come
back
to
me
you
will
not
prevent
francesca
said
it
was
needless
to
exact
such
a
promise
since
she
was
so
fond
of
raniero
that
nothing
could
separate
her
from
him
but
raniero
gave
his
promise
promptly
of
one
thing
you
can
be
assured
jacopo
said
i
will
not
try
to
hold
any
woman
who
wishes
to
flee
from
then
francesca
went
to
live
with
raniero
and
all
was
well
between
them
for
a
time
when
they
had
been
married
a
few
weeks
raniero
took
it
into
his
head
that
he
would
practice
marksmanship
for
several
days
he
aimed
at
a
painting
which
hung
upon
a
wall
he
soon
became
skilled
and
hit
the
mark
every
time
at
last
he
thought
he
would
like
to
try
and
shoot
at
a
more
difficult
mark
he
looked
around
for
something
suitable
but
discovered
nothing
except
a
quail
that
sat
in
a
cage
above
the
courtyard
gate
the
bird
belonged
to
francesca
and
she
was
very
fond
of
it
but
despite
this
raniero
sent
a
page
to
open
the
cage
and
shot
the
quail
as
it
swung
itself
into
the
air
this
seemed
to
him
a
very
good
shot
and
he
boasted
of
it
to
any
one
who
would
listen
to
him
when
francesca
learned
that
raniero
had
shot
her
bird
she
grew
pale
and
looked
hard
at
him
she
marveled
that
he
had
wished
to
do
a
thing
which
must
bring
grief
to
her
but
she
forgave
him
promptly
and
loved
him
as
before
then
all
went
well
again
for
a
time
raniero
s
jacopo
was
a
flax
weaver
he
had
a
large
establishment
where
much
work
was
done
raniero
thought
he
had
discovered
that
hemp
was
mixed
with
the
flax
in
jacopo
s
workshop
and
he
did
not
keep
silent
about
it
but
talked
of
it
here
and
there
in
the
city
at
last
jacopo
also
heard
this
chatter
and
tried
at
once
to
put
a
stop
to
it
he
let
several
other
flax
weavers
examine
his
yarn
and
cloth
and
they
found
all
of
it
to
be
of
the
very
finest
flax
only
in
one
pack
which
was
designed
to
be
sold
outside
of
florence
was
there
any
mixture
then
jacopo
said
that
the
deception
had
been
practised
without
his
knowledge
or
consent
by
some
one
among
his
journeymen
he
apprehended
at
once
that
he
would
find
it
difficult
to
convince
people
of
this
he
had
always
been
famed
for
honesty
and
he
felt
very
keenly
that
his
honor
had
been
smirched
raniero
on
the
other
hand
plumed
himself
upon
having
succeeded
in
exposing
a
fraud
and
he
bragged
about
it
even
in
francesca
s
hearing
she
felt
deeply
grieved
at
the
same
time
she
was
as
astonished
as
when
he
shot
the
bird
as
she
thought
of
this
she
seemed
suddenly
to
see
her
love
before
her
and
it
was
like
a
great
piece
of
shimmery
gold
cloth
she
could
see
how
big
it
was
and
how
it
shimmered
but
from
one
corner
a
piece
had
been
cut
away
so
that
it
was
not
as
big
and
as
beautiful
as
it
had
been
in
the
beginning
still
it
was
as
yet
damaged
so
very
little
that
she
thought
it
will
probably
last
as
long
as
i
live
it
is
so
great
that
it
can
never
come
to
an
again
there
was
a
period
during
which
she
and
raniero
were
just
as
happy
as
they
had
been
at
first
francesca
had
a
brother
named
taddeo
he
had
been
in
venice
on
a
business
trip
and
while
there
had
purchased
garments
of
silk
and
velvet
when
he
came
home
he
paraded
around
in
them
now
in
florence
it
was
not
the
custom
to
go
about
expensively
clad
so
there
were
many
who
made
fun
of
him
one
night
taddeo
and
raniero
were
out
in
the
wine
shops
taddeo
was
dressed
in
a
green
cloak
with
sable
linings
and
a
violet
jacket
raniero
tempted
him
to
drink
so
much
wine
that
he
fell
asleep
and
then
he
took
his
cloak
off
him
and
hung
it
upon
a
scarecrow
that
was
set
up
in
a
cabbage
patch
when
francesca
heard
of
this
she
was
vexed
again
with
raniero
that
moment
she
saw
before
her
the
big
piece
of
gold
was
her
she
seemed
to
see
how
it
diminished
as
raniero
cut
away
piece
after
piece
after
this
things
were
patched
up
between
them
for
a
time
but
francesca
was
no
longer
so
happy
as
in
former
days
because
she
always
feared
that
raniero
would
commit
some
misdemeanor
that
would
hurt
her
love
this
was
not
long
in
coming
either
for
raniero
could
never
be
tranquil
he
wished
that
people
should
always
speak
of
him
and
praise
his
courage
and
daring
at
that
time
the
cathedral
in
florence
was
much
smaller
than
the
present
one
and
there
hung
at
the
top
of
one
of
its
towers
a
big
heavy
shield
which
had
been
placed
there
by
one
of
francesca
s
ancestors
it
was
the
heaviest
shield
any
man
in
florence
had
been
able
to
lift
and
all
the
uberti
family
were
proud
because
it
was
one
of
their
own
who
had
climbed
up
in
the
tower
and
hung
it
there
but
raniero
climbed
up
to
the
shield
one
day
hung
it
on
his
back
and
came
down
with
it
when
francesca
heard
of
this
for
the
first
time
she
spoke
to
raniero
of
what
troubled
her
and
begged
him
not
to
humiliate
her
family
in
this
way
raniero
who
had
expected
that
she
would
commend
him
for
his
feat
became
very
angry
he
retorted
that
he
had
long
observed
that
she
did
not
rejoice
in
his
success
but
thought
only
of
her
own
kin
it
s
something
else
i
am
thinking
of
said
francesca
and
that
is
my
love
i
know
not
what
will
become
of
it
if
you
keep
on
in
this
after
this
they
frequently
exchanged
harsh
words
for
raniero
happened
nearly
always
to
do
the
very
thing
that
was
most
distasteful
to
francesca
there
was
a
workman
in
raniero
s
shop
who
was
little
and
lame
this
man
had
loved
francesca
before
she
was
married
and
continued
to
love
her
even
after
her
marriage
raniero
who
knew
this
undertook
to
joke
with
him
before
all
who
sat
at
a
table
it
went
so
far
that
finally
the
man
could
no
longer
bear
to
be
held
up
to
ridicule
in
francesca
s
hearing
so
he
rushed
upon
raniero
and
wanted
to
fight
with
him
but
raniero
only
smiled
derisively
and
kicked
him
aside
then
the
poor
fellow
thought
he
did
not
care
to
live
any
longer
and
went
off
and
hanged
himself
when
this
happened
francesca
and
raniero
had
been
married
about
a
year
francesca
thought
continually
that
she
saw
her
love
before
her
as
a
shimmery
piece
of
cloth
but
on
all
sides
large
pieces
were
cut
away
so
that
it
was
scarcely
half
as
big
as
it
had
been
in
the
beginning
she
became
very
much
alarmed
when
she
saw
this
and
thought
if
i
stay
with
raniero
another
year
he
will
destroy
my
love
i
shall
become
just
as
poor
as
i
have
hitherto
been
then
she
concluded
to
leave
raniero
s
house
and
go
to
live
with
her
father
that
the
day
might
not
come
when
she
should
hate
raniero
as
much
as
she
now
loved
him
jacopo
degli
uberti
was
sitting
at
the
loom
with
all
his
workmen
busy
around
him
when
he
saw
her
coming
he
said
that
now
the
thing
had
come
to
pass
which
he
had
long
expected
and
bade
her
be
welcome
instantly
he
ordered
all
the
people
to
leave
off
their
work
and
arm
themselves
and
close
the
house
then
jacopo
went
over
to
raniero
he
met
him
in
the
workshop
my
daughter
has
this
day
returned
to
me
and
begged
that
she
may
live
again
under
my
roof
he
said
to
his
and
now
i
expect
that
you
will
not
compel
her
to
return
to
you
after
the
promise
you
have
given
raniero
did
not
seem
to
take
this
very
seriously
but
answered
calmly
even
if
i
had
not
given
you
my
word
i
would
not
demand
the
return
of
a
woman
who
does
not
wish
to
be
he
knew
how
much
francesca
loved
him
and
said
to
himself
she
will
be
back
with
me
before
yet
she
did
not
appear
either
that
day
or
the
next
the
third
day
raniero
went
out
and
pursued
a
couple
of
robbers
who
had
long
disturbed
the
florentine
merchants
he
succeeded
in
catching
them
and
took
them
captives
to
florence
he
remained
quiet
a
couple
of
days
until
he
was
positive
that
this
feat
was
known
throughout
the
city
but
it
did
not
turn
out
as
he
had
it
would
bring
francesca
back
to
him
raniero
had
the
greatest
desire
to
appeal
to
the
courts
to
force
her
return
to
him
but
he
felt
himself
unable
to
do
this
because
of
his
promise
it
seemed
impossible
for
him
to
live
in
the
same
city
with
a
wife
who
had
abandoned
him
so
he
moved
away
from
florence
he
first
became
a
soldier
and
very
soon
he
made
himself
commander
of
a
volunteer
company
he
was
always
in
a
fight
and
served
many
masters
he
won
much
renown
as
a
warrior
as
he
had
always
said
he
would
he
was
made
a
knight
by
the
emperor
and
was
accounted
a
great
man
before
he
left
florence
he
had
made
a
vow
at
a
sacred
image
of
the
madonna
in
the
cathedral
to
present
to
the
blessed
virgin
the
best
and
rarest
that
he
won
in
every
battle
before
this
image
one
always
saw
costly
gifts
which
were
presented
by
raniero
raniero
was
aware
that
all
his
deeds
were
known
in
his
native
city
he
marveled
much
that
francesca
degli
uberti
did
not
come
back
to
him
when
she
knew
all
about
his
success
at
that
time
sermons
were
preached
to
start
the
crusades
for
the
recovery
of
the
holy
sepulchre
from
the
saracens
and
raniero
took
the
cross
and
departed
for
the
orient
he
not
only
hoped
to
win
castles
and
lands
to
rule
over
but
also
to
succeed
in
performing
such
brilliant
feats
that
his
wife
would
again
be
fond
of
him
and
return
to
him
ii
the
night
succeeding
the
day
on
which
jerusalem
had
been
captured
there
was
great
rejoicing
in
the
crusaders
camp
outside
the
city
in
almost
every
tent
they
celebrated
with
drinking
bouts
and
noise
and
roystering
were
heard
in
every
direction
raniero
di
raniero
sat
and
drank
with
some
comrades
and
in
his
tent
it
was
even
more
hilarious
than
elsewhere
the
servants
barely
had
time
to
fill
the
goblets
before
they
were
empty
again
raniero
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
celebrating
because
during
the
day
he
had
won
greater
glory
than
ever
before
in
the
morning
when
the
city
was
besieged
he
had
been
the
first
to
scale
the
walls
after
godfrey
of
boulogne
and
in
the
evening
he
had
been
honored
for
his
bravery
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
corps
when
the
plunder
and
murder
were
ended
and
the
crusaders
in
penitents
cloaks
and
with
lighted
candles
marched
into
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
it
had
been
announced
to
raniero
by
godfrey
that
he
should
be
the
first
who
might
light
his
candle
from
the
sacred
candles
which
burn
before
christ
s
tomb
it
appeared
to
raniero
that
godfrey
wished
in
this
manner
to
show
that
he
considered
him
the
bravest
man
in
the
whole
corps
and
he
was
very
happy
over
the
way
in
which
he
had
been
rewarded
for
his
achievements
as
the
night
wore
on
raniero
and
his
guests
were
in
the
best
of
spirits
a
fool
and
a
couple
of
musicians
who
had
wandered
all
over
the
camp
and
amused
the
people
with
their
pranks
came
into
raniero
s
tent
and
the
fool
asked
permission
to
narrate
a
comic
story
raniero
knew
that
this
particular
fool
was
in
great
demand
for
his
drollery
and
he
promised
to
listen
to
his
narrative
it
happened
once
said
the
fool
that
our
lord
and
saint
peter
sat
a
whole
day
upon
the
highest
tower
in
paradise
stronghold
and
looked
down
upon
the
earth
they
had
so
much
to
look
at
that
they
scarcely
found
time
to
exchange
a
word
our
lord
kept
perfectly
still
the
whole
time
but
saint
peter
sometimes
clapped
his
hands
for
joy
and
again
turned
his
head
away
in
disgust
sometimes
he
applauded
and
smiled
and
anon
he
wept
and
commiserated
finally
as
it
drew
toward
the
close
of
day
and
twilight
sank
down
over
paradise
our
lord
turned
to
saint
peter
and
said
that
now
he
must
surely
be
satisfied
and
content
what
is
it
that
i
should
be
content
with
saint
peter
asked
in
an
impetuous
tone
why
said
our
lord
slowly
i
thought
that
you
would
be
pleased
with
what
you
have
seen
but
saint
peter
did
not
care
to
be
conciliated
it
is
true
said
he
that
for
many
years
i
have
bemoaned
the
fact
that
jerusalem
should
be
in
the
power
of
unbelievers
but
after
all
that
has
happened
i
think
it
might
just
as
well
have
remained
as
it
raniero
understood
now
that
the
fool
spoke
of
what
had
taken
place
during
the
day
both
he
and
the
other
knights
began
to
listen
with
greater
interest
than
in
the
beginning
when
saint
peter
had
said
this
continued
the
fool
as
he
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
the
knights
he
leaned
over
the
pinnacle
of
the
tower
and
pointed
toward
the
earth
he
showed
our
lord
a
city
which
lay
upon
a
great
solitary
rock
that
shot
up
from
a
mountain
valley
do
you
see
those
mounds
of
corpses
he
said
and
do
you
see
the
naked
and
wretched
prisoners
who
moan
in
the
night
chill
and
do
you
see
all
the
smoking
ruins
of
the
conflagration
it
appeared
as
if
our
lord
did
not
wish
to
answer
him
but
saint
peter
went
on
with
his
lamentations
he
said
that
he
had
certainly
been
vexed
with
that
city
many
times
but
he
had
not
wished
it
so
ill
as
that
it
should
come
to
look
like
this
then
at
last
our
lord
answered
and
tried
an
objection
still
you
can
not
deny
that
the
christian
knights
have
risked
their
lives
with
the
utmost
fearlessness
said
then
the
fool
was
interrupted
by
bravos
but
he
made
haste
to
continue
oh
don
t
interrupt
me
he
said
now
i
don
t
remember
where
i
left
to
be
sure
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
saint
peter
wiped
away
a
tear
or
two
which
sprang
to
his
eyes
and
prevented
him
from
seeing
i
never
would
have
thought
they
could
be
such
beasts
said
he
they
have
murdered
and
plundered
the
whole
day
why
you
went
to
all
the
trouble
of
letting
yourself
be
crucified
in
order
to
gain
such
devotees
i
can
t
in
the
least
the
knights
took
up
the
fun
they
began
to
laugh
loud
and
merrily
what
fool
is
saint
peter
so
wroth
with
us
shrieked
one
of
them
be
silent
now
and
let
us
hear
if
our
lord
spoke
in
our
defense
interposed
another
no
our
lord
was
silent
he
knew
of
old
that
when
saint
peter
had
once
got
it
wasn
t
worth
while
to
argue
with
him
he
went
on
in
his
way
and
said
that
our
lord
needn
t
trouble
to
tell
him
that
finally
they
remembered
to
which
city
they
had
come
and
went
to
church
barefooted
and
in
penitents
garb
that
spirit
had
of
course
not
lasted
long
enough
to
be
worth
mentioning
and
thereupon
he
leaned
once
more
over
the
tower
and
pointed
downward
toward
jerusalem
he
pointed
out
the
christians
camp
outside
the
city
do
you
see
how
your
knights
celebrate
their
victories
he
asked
and
our
lord
saw
that
there
was
revelry
everywhere
in
the
camp
knights
and
soldiers
sat
and
looked
upon
syrian
dancers
filled
goblets
went
the
rounds
while
they
threw
dice
for
the
spoils
of
war
they
listened
to
fools
who
told
vile
stories
interpolated
raniero
was
not
this
also
a
great
sin
the
fool
laughed
and
shook
his
head
at
raniero
as
much
as
to
say
wait
i
will
pay
you
no
don
t
interrupt
me
he
begged
once
again
a
poor
fool
forgets
so
easily
what
he
would
say
ah
it
was
this
saint
peter
asked
our
lord
if
he
thought
these
people
were
much
of
a
credit
to
him
to
this
of
course
our
lord
had
to
reply
that
he
didn
t
think
they
were
they
were
robbers
and
murderers
before
they
left
home
and
robbers
and
murderers
they
are
even
this
undertaking
you
could
just
as
well
have
left
undone
no
good
will
come
of
it
said
saint
come
come
fool
said
raniero
in
a
threatening
tone
but
the
fool
seemed
to
consider
it
an
honor
to
test
how
far
he
could
go
without
some
one
jumping
up
and
throwing
him
out
and
he
continued
fearlessly
our
lord
only
bowed
his
head
like
one
who
acknowledges
that
he
is
being
justly
rebuked
but
almost
at
the
same
instant
he
leaned
forward
eagerly
and
peered
down
with
closer
scrutiny
than
before
saint
peter
also
glanced
down
what
are
you
looking
for
he
the
fool
delivered
this
speech
with
much
animated
facial
play
all
the
knights
saw
our
lord
and
saint
peter
before
their
eyes
and
they
wondered
what
it
was
our
lord
had
caught
sight
of
our
lord
answered
that
it
was
nothing
in
particular
said
the
fool
saint
peter
gazed
in
the
direction
of
our
lord
s
glance
but
he
could
discover
nothing
except
that
our
lord
sat
and
looked
down
into
a
big
tent
outside
of
which
a
couple
of
saracen
heads
were
set
up
on
long
lances
and
where
a
lot
of
fine
rugs
golden
vessels
and
costly
weapons
captured
in
the
holy
city
were
piled
up
in
that
tent
they
carried
on
as
they
did
everywhere
else
in
the
camp
a
company
of
knights
sat
and
emptied
their
goblets
the
only
difference
might
be
that
here
there
were
more
drinking
and
roystering
than
elsewhere
saint
peter
could
not
comprehend
why
our
lord
was
so
pleased
when
he
looked
down
there
that
his
eyes
fairly
sparkled
with
delight
so
many
hard
and
cruel
faces
he
had
rarely
before
seen
gathered
around
a
drinking
table
and
he
who
was
host
at
the
board
and
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
was
the
most
dreadful
of
all
he
was
a
man
of
frightfully
big
and
coarse
with
a
blowsy
countenance
covered
with
scars
and
scratches
calloused
hands
and
a
loud
bellowing
here
the
fool
paused
a
moment
as
if
he
feared
to
go
on
but
both
raniero
and
the
others
liked
to
hear
him
talk
of
themselves
and
only
laughed
at
his
audacity
you
re
a
daring
fellow
said
raniero
so
let
us
see
what
you
are
driving
at
finally
our
lord
said
a
few
words
continued
the
fool
which
made
saint
peter
understand
what
he
rejoiced
over
he
asked
saint
peter
if
he
saw
wrongly
or
if
it
could
actually
be
true
that
one
of
the
knights
had
a
burning
candle
beside
raniero
gave
a
start
at
these
words
now
at
last
he
was
angry
with
the
fool
and
reached
out
his
hand
for
a
heavy
wine
pitcher
to
throw
at
his
face
but
he
controlled
himself
that
he
might
hear
whether
the
fellow
wished
to
speak
to
his
credit
or
discredit
saint
peter
saw
now
narrated
the
fool
that
although
the
tent
was
lighted
mostly
by
torches
one
of
the
knights
really
had
a
burning
wax
candle
beside
him
it
was
a
long
thick
candle
one
of
the
sort
made
to
burn
hours
the
knight
who
had
no
candlestick
to
set
it
in
had
gathered
together
some
stones
and
piled
them
around
it
to
make
it
the
company
burst
into
shrieks
of
laughter
at
this
all
pointed
at
a
candle
which
stood
on
the
table
beside
raniero
and
was
exactly
like
the
one
the
fool
had
described
the
blood
mounted
to
raniero
s
head
for
this
was
the
candle
which
he
had
a
few
hours
before
been
permitted
to
light
at
the
holy
sepulchre
he
had
been
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
to
let
it
die
out
when
saint
peter
saw
that
candle
said
the
fool
it
dawned
upon
him
what
it
was
that
our
lord
was
so
happy
over
but
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
help
feeling
just
a
little
sorry
for
him
oh
he
said
it
was
the
same
knight
that
leaped
upon
the
wall
this
morning
immediately
after
the
gentleman
of
boulogne
and
who
this
evening
was
permitted
to
light
his
candle
at
the
holy
sepulchre
ahead
of
all
the
others
true
said
our
lord
and
as
you
see
his
candle
is
still
the
fool
talked
very
fast
now
casting
an
occasional
sly
glance
at
raniero
saint
peter
could
not
help
pitying
our
lord
can
t
you
understand
why
he
keeps
that
candle
burning
said
he
you
must
believe
that
he
thinks
of
your
sufferings
and
death
whenever
he
looks
at
it
but
he
thinks
only
of
the
glory
which
he
won
when
he
was
acknowledged
to
be
the
bravest
man
in
the
troop
after
at
this
all
raniero
s
guests
laughed
raniero
was
very
angry
but
he
too
forced
himself
to
laugh
he
knew
they
would
have
found
it
still
more
amusing
if
he
hadn
t
been
able
to
take
a
little
fun
but
our
lord
contradicted
saint
peter
said
the
fool
don
t
you
see
how
careful
he
is
with
the
light
asked
he
he
puts
his
hand
before
the
flame
as
soon
as
any
one
raises
the
for
fear
the
draught
will
blow
it
out
and
he
is
constantly
occupied
in
chasing
away
the
moths
which
fly
around
it
and
threaten
to
extinguish
the
laughter
grew
merrier
and
merrier
for
what
the
fool
said
was
the
truth
raniero
found
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
control
himself
he
felt
he
could
not
endure
that
any
one
should
jest
about
the
sacred
candle
still
saint
peter
was
dubious
continued
the
fool
he
asked
our
lord
if
he
knew
that
knight
he
s
not
one
who
goes
often
to
mass
or
wears
out
the
said
he
but
our
lord
could
not
be
swerved
from
his
opinion
saint
peter
saint
peter
he
said
earnestly
remember
that
henceforth
this
knight
shall
become
more
pious
than
godfrey
whence
do
piety
and
gentleness
spring
if
not
from
my
sepulchre
you
shall
see
raniero
di
raniero
help
widows
and
distressed
prisoners
you
shall
see
him
care
for
the
sick
and
despairing
as
he
now
cares
for
the
sacred
candle
at
this
they
laughed
inordinately
it
struck
them
all
as
very
ludicrous
for
they
knew
raniero
s
disposition
and
mode
of
living
but
he
himself
found
both
the
jokes
and
laughter
intolerable
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
wanted
to
reprove
the
fool
as
he
did
this
he
bumped
so
hard
against
the
was
only
a
door
set
up
on
loose
it
wabbled
and
the
candle
fell
down
it
was
evident
now
how
careful
raniero
was
to
keep
the
candle
burning
he
controlled
his
anger
and
gave
himself
time
to
pick
it
up
and
brighten
the
flame
before
he
rushed
upon
the
fool
but
when
he
had
trimmed
the
light
the
fool
had
already
darted
out
of
the
tent
and
raniero
knew
it
would
be
useless
to
pursue
him
in
the
darkness
i
shall
probably
run
across
him
another
time
he
thought
and
sat
down
meanwhile
the
guests
had
laughed
mockingly
and
one
of
them
turned
to
raniero
and
wanted
to
continue
the
jesting
he
said
there
is
one
thing
however
which
is
certain
raniero
and
that
time
you
can
t
send
to
the
madonna
in
florence
the
most
precious
thing
you
have
won
in
the
raniero
asked
why
he
thought
that
he
should
not
follow
his
old
habit
this
time
for
no
other
reason
said
the
knight
than
that
the
most
precious
thing
you
have
won
is
that
sacred
candle
flame
which
you
were
permitted
to
light
at
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
in
presence
of
the
whole
corps
surely
you
can
t
send
that
to
florence
again
the
other
knights
laughed
but
raniero
was
now
in
the
mood
to
undertake
the
wildest
projects
just
to
put
an
end
to
their
laughter
he
came
to
a
conclusion
quickly
called
to
an
old
squire
and
said
to
him
make
ready
giovanni
for
a
long
journey
you
shall
travel
to
florence
with
this
sacred
candle
but
the
squire
said
a
blunt
no
to
this
command
this
is
something
which
i
don
t
care
to
undertake
he
said
how
should
it
be
possible
to
travel
to
florence
with
a
candle
flame
it
would
be
extinguished
before
i
had
left
the
raniero
asked
one
after
another
of
his
men
he
received
the
same
reply
from
all
they
scarcely
seemed
to
take
his
command
seriously
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
foreign
knights
who
were
his
guests
should
laugh
even
louder
and
more
merrily
as
it
became
apparent
that
none
of
raniero
s
men
wished
to
carry
out
his
order
raniero
grew
more
and
more
excited
finally
he
lost
his
patience
and
shouted
this
candle
flame
shall
nevertheless
be
borne
to
florence
and
since
no
one
else
will
ride
there
with
it
i
will
do
so
myself
consider
before
you
promise
anything
of
the
kind
said
a
knight
you
ride
away
from
a
i
swear
to
you
that
i
will
carry
this
sacred
flame
to
florence
exclaimed
raniero
i
shall
do
what
no
one
else
has
cared
to
the
old
squire
defended
himself
master
it
s
another
matter
for
you
you
can
take
with
you
a
large
retinue
but
me
you
would
send
but
raniero
was
clean
out
of
himself
and
did
not
consider
his
words
i
too
shall
travel
alone
said
he
but
with
this
declaration
raniero
had
carried
his
point
every
one
in
the
tent
had
ceased
laughing
terrified
they
sat
and
stared
at
him
why
don
t
you
laugh
any
more
asked
raniero
this
undertaking
surely
can
t
be
anything
but
a
child
s
game
for
a
brave
iii
the
next
morning
at
dawn
raniero
mounted
his
horse
he
was
in
full
armor
but
over
it
he
had
thrown
a
coarse
pilgrim
cloak
so
that
the
iron
dress
should
not
become
overheated
by
exposure
to
the
sun
s
rays
he
was
armed
with
a
sword
and
and
rode
a
good
horse
he
held
in
his
hand
a
burning
candle
and
to
the
saddle
he
had
tied
a
couple
of
bundles
of
long
wax
candles
so
the
flame
should
not
die
out
for
lack
of
nourishment
raniero
rode
slowly
through
the
long
encumbered
tent
street
and
thus
far
all
went
well
it
was
still
so
early
that
the
mists
which
had
arisen
from
the
deep
dales
surrounding
jerusalem
were
not
dispersed
and
raniero
rode
forward
as
in
a
white
night
the
whole
troop
slept
and
raniero
passed
the
guards
easily
none
of
them
called
out
his
name
for
the
mist
prevented
their
seeing
him
and
the
roads
were
covered
with
a
soil
a
foot
high
which
made
the
horse
s
tramp
inaudible
raniero
was
soon
outside
the
camp
and
started
on
the
road
which
led
to
joppa
here
it
was
smoother
but
he
rode
very
slowly
now
because
of
the
candle
which
burned
feebly
in
the
thick
mist
big
insects
kept
dashing
against
the
flame
raniero
had
all
he
could
do
guarding
it
but
he
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
thought
all
the
while
that
the
mission
which
he
had
undertaken
was
so
easy
that
a
child
could
manage
it
meanwhile
the
horse
grew
weary
of
the
slow
pace
and
began
to
trot
the
flame
began
to
flicker
in
the
wind
it
didn
t
help
that
raniero
tried
to
shield
it
with
his
hand
and
with
the
cloak
he
saw
that
it
was
about
to
be
extinguished
but
he
had
no
desire
to
abandon
the
project
so
soon
he
stopped
the
horse
sat
still
a
moment
and
pondered
then
he
dismounted
and
tried
sitting
backwards
so
that
his
body
shielded
the
flame
from
the
wind
in
this
way
he
succeeded
in
keeping
it
burning
but
he
realized
now
that
the
journey
would
be
more
difficult
than
he
had
thought
at
the
beginning
when
he
had
passed
the
mountains
which
surround
jerusalem
the
fog
lifted
he
rode
forward
now
in
the
greatest
solitude
there
were
no
people
houses
green
trees
nor
bare
rocks
here
raniero
was
attacked
by
robbers
they
were
idle
folk
who
followed
the
camp
without
permission
and
lived
by
theft
and
plunder
they
had
lain
in
hiding
behind
a
hill
and
rode
not
seen
them
until
they
had
surrounded
him
and
brandished
their
swords
at
him
there
were
about
twelve
men
they
looked
wretched
and
rode
poor
horses
raniero
saw
at
once
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
for
him
to
break
through
this
company
and
ride
on
and
after
his
proud
boast
of
the
night
before
he
was
unwilling
to
abandon
his
undertaking
easily
he
saw
no
other
means
of
escape
than
to
compromise
with
the
robbers
he
told
them
that
since
he
was
armed
and
rode
a
good
horse
it
might
be
difficult
to
overpower
him
if
he
defended
himself
and
as
he
was
bound
by
a
vow
he
did
not
wish
to
offer
resistance
but
they
could
take
whatever
they
wanted
without
a
struggle
if
only
they
promised
not
to
put
out
his
light
the
robbers
had
expected
a
hard
struggle
and
were
very
happy
over
raniero
s
proposal
and
began
immediately
to
plunder
him
they
took
from
him
armor
and
steed
weapons
and
money
the
only
thing
they
let
him
keep
was
the
coarse
cloak
and
the
two
bundles
of
wax
candles
they
sacredly
kept
their
promise
also
not
to
put
out
the
candle
flame
one
of
them
mounted
raniero
s
horse
when
he
noticed
what
a
fine
animal
he
was
he
felt
a
little
sorry
for
the
rider
he
called
out
to
him
come
come
we
must
not
be
too
cruel
toward
a
christian
you
shall
have
my
old
horse
to
it
was
a
miserable
old
screw
of
a
horse
it
moved
as
stiffly
and
with
as
much
difficulty
as
if
it
were
made
of
wood
when
the
robbers
had
gone
at
last
and
raniero
had
mounted
the
wretched
horse
he
said
to
himself
i
must
have
become
bewitched
by
this
candle
flame
for
its
sake
i
must
now
travel
along
the
roads
like
a
crazy
he
knew
it
would
be
wise
for
him
to
turn
back
because
the
undertaking
was
really
impracticable
but
such
an
intense
yearning
to
accomplish
it
had
come
over
him
that
he
could
not
resist
the
desire
to
go
on
therefore
he
went
farther
he
saw
all
around
him
the
same
bare
yellowish
hills
after
a
while
he
came
across
a
goatherd
who
tended
four
goats
when
raniero
saw
the
animals
grazing
on
the
barren
ground
he
wondered
if
they
ate
earth
this
goatherd
had
owned
a
larger
flock
which
had
been
stolen
from
him
by
the
crusaders
when
he
noticed
a
solitary
christian
come
riding
toward
him
he
tried
to
do
him
all
the
harm
he
could
he
rushed
up
to
him
and
struck
at
his
light
with
his
staff
raniero
was
so
taken
up
by
the
flame
that
he
could
not
defend
himself
even
against
a
goatherd
he
only
drew
the
candle
close
to
him
to
protect
it
the
goatherd
struck
at
it
several
times
more
then
he
paused
astonished
and
ceased
striking
he
noticed
that
raniero
s
cloak
had
caught
fire
but
raniero
did
nothing
to
smother
the
blaze
so
long
as
the
sacred
flame
was
in
danger
the
goatherd
looked
as
though
he
felt
ashamed
for
a
long
time
he
followed
raniero
and
in
one
place
where
the
road
was
very
narrow
with
a
deep
chasm
on
each
side
of
it
he
came
up
and
led
the
horse
for
him
raniero
smiled
and
thought
the
goatherd
surely
regarded
him
as
a
holy
man
who
had
undertaken
a
voluntary
penance
toward
evening
raniero
began
to
meet
people
rumors
of
the
fall
of
jerusalem
had
already
spread
to
the
coast
and
a
throng
of
people
had
immediately
prepared
to
go
up
there
there
were
pilgrims
who
for
years
had
awaited
an
opportunity
to
get
into
jerusalem
also
some
troops
but
they
were
mostly
merchants
who
were
hastening
with
provisions
when
these
throngs
met
raniero
who
came
riding
backwards
with
a
burning
candle
in
his
hand
they
cried
a
madman
a
madman
the
majority
were
italians
and
raniero
heard
how
they
shouted
in
his
own
tongue
pazzo
pazzo
which
means
a
madman
a
raniero
who
had
been
able
to
keep
himself
well
in
check
all
day
became
intensely
irritated
by
these
shouts
instantly
he
dismounted
and
began
to
chastise
the
offenders
with
his
hard
fists
when
they
saw
how
heavy
the
blows
were
they
took
to
their
heels
and
raniero
soon
stood
alone
on
the
road
now
raniero
was
himself
again
in
truth
they
were
right
to
call
me
a
madman
he
said
as
he
looked
around
for
the
light
he
did
not
know
what
he
had
done
with
it
at
last
he
saw
that
it
had
rolled
down
into
a
hollow
the
flame
was
extinguished
but
he
saw
fire
gleam
from
a
dry
close
beside
it
and
understood
that
luck
was
with
him
for
the
flame
had
ignited
the
grass
before
it
had
gone
out
this
might
have
been
an
inglorious
end
of
a
deal
of
trouble
he
thought
as
he
lit
the
candle
and
stepped
into
the
saddle
he
was
rather
mortified
it
did
not
seem
to
him
very
probable
that
his
journey
would
be
a
success
in
the
evening
raniero
reached
ramle
and
rode
up
to
a
place
where
caravans
usually
had
night
harbor
it
was
a
large
covered
yard
all
around
it
were
little
stalls
where
travelers
could
put
up
their
horses
there
were
no
rooms
but
folk
could
sleep
beside
the
animals
the
place
was
overcrowded
with
people
yet
the
host
found
room
for
raniero
and
his
horse
he
also
gave
fodder
to
the
horse
and
food
to
the
rider
when
raniero
perceived
that
he
was
well
treated
he
thought
i
almost
believe
the
robbers
did
me
a
service
when
they
took
from
me
my
armor
and
my
horse
i
shall
certainly
get
out
of
the
country
more
easily
with
my
light
burden
if
they
mistake
me
for
a
when
he
had
led
the
horse
into
the
stall
he
sat
down
on
a
sheaf
of
straw
and
held
the
candle
in
his
hands
it
was
his
intention
not
to
fall
asleep
but
to
remain
awake
all
night
but
he
had
hardly
seated
himself
when
he
fell
asleep
he
was
fearfully
exhausted
and
in
his
sleep
he
stretched
out
full
length
and
did
not
wake
till
morning
when
he
awoke
he
saw
neither
flame
nor
candle
he
searched
in
the
straw
for
the
candle
but
did
not
find
it
anywhere
some
one
has
taken
it
from
me
and
extinguished
it
he
said
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
glad
that
all
was
over
and
that
he
need
not
pursue
an
impossible
undertaking
but
as
he
pondered
he
felt
a
sense
of
emptiness
and
loss
he
thought
that
never
before
had
he
so
longed
to
succeed
in
anything
on
which
he
had
set
his
mind
he
led
the
horse
out
and
groomed
and
saddled
it
when
he
was
ready
to
set
out
the
host
who
owned
the
caravansary
came
up
to
him
with
a
burning
candle
he
said
in
frankish
when
you
fell
asleep
last
night
i
had
to
take
your
light
from
you
but
here
you
have
it
raniero
betrayed
nothing
but
said
very
calmly
it
was
wise
of
you
to
extinguish
i
have
not
extinguished
it
said
the
man
i
noticed
that
it
was
burning
when
you
arrived
and
i
thought
it
was
of
importance
to
you
that
it
should
continue
to
burn
if
you
see
how
much
it
has
decreased
you
will
understand
that
it
has
been
burning
all
raniero
beamed
with
happiness
he
commended
the
host
heartily
and
rode
away
in
the
best
of
spirits
iv
when
raniero
broke
away
from
the
camp
at
jerusalem
he
intended
to
travel
from
joppa
to
italy
by
sea
but
changed
his
mind
after
he
had
been
robbed
of
his
money
and
concluded
to
make
the
journey
by
land
it
was
a
long
journey
from
joppa
he
went
northward
along
the
syrian
coast
then
he
rode
westward
along
the
peninsula
of
asia
minor
then
northward
again
all
the
way
to
constantinople
from
there
he
still
had
a
monotonously
long
distance
to
travel
to
reach
florence
during
the
whole
journey
raniero
had
lived
upon
the
contributions
of
the
pious
they
that
shared
their
bread
with
him
mostly
were
pilgrims
who
at
this
time
traveled
to
jerusalem
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
nearly
always
rode
alone
his
days
were
neither
long
nor
monotonous
he
must
always
guard
the
candle
flame
and
on
its
account
he
never
could
feel
at
ease
it
needed
only
a
puff
of
there
would
have
been
an
end
to
it
as
raniero
rode
over
lonely
roads
and
thought
only
about
keeping
the
flame
alive
it
occurred
to
him
that
once
before
he
had
been
concerned
with
something
similar
once
before
he
had
seen
a
person
watch
over
something
which
was
just
as
sensitive
as
a
candle
flame
this
recollection
was
so
vague
to
him
at
first
that
he
wondered
if
it
was
something
he
had
dreamed
but
as
he
rode
on
alone
through
the
country
it
kept
recurring
to
him
that
he
had
participated
in
something
similar
once
before
it
is
as
if
all
my
life
long
i
had
heard
tell
of
nothing
else
said
he
one
evening
he
rode
into
a
city
it
was
after
sundown
and
the
housewives
stood
in
their
doorways
and
watched
for
their
husbands
then
he
noticed
one
who
was
tall
and
slender
and
had
earnest
eyes
she
reminded
him
of
francesca
degli
uberti
instantly
it
became
clear
to
him
what
he
had
been
pondering
over
it
came
to
him
that
for
francesca
her
love
must
have
been
as
a
sacred
flame
which
she
had
always
wished
to
keep
burning
and
which
she
had
constantly
feared
that
raniero
would
quench
he
was
astonished
at
this
thought
but
grew
more
and
more
certain
that
the
matter
stood
thus
for
the
first
time
he
began
to
understand
why
francesca
had
left
him
and
that
it
was
not
with
feats
of
arms
he
should
win
her
back
the
journey
which
raniero
made
was
of
long
duration
this
was
in
part
due
to
the
fact
that
he
could
not
venture
out
when
the
weather
was
bad
then
he
sat
in
some
caravansary
and
guarded
the
candle
flame
these
were
very
trying
days
one
day
when
he
rode
over
mount
lebanon
he
saw
that
a
storm
was
brewing
he
was
riding
high
up
among
awful
precipices
and
a
frightful
distance
from
any
human
abode
finally
he
saw
on
the
summit
of
a
rock
the
tomb
of
a
saracen
saint
it
was
a
little
square
stone
structure
with
a
vaulted
roof
he
thought
it
best
to
seek
shelter
there
he
had
barely
entered
when
a
snowstorm
came
up
which
raged
for
two
days
and
nights
at
the
same
time
it
grew
so
cold
that
he
came
near
freezing
to
death
raniero
knew
that
there
were
heaps
of
branches
and
twigs
out
on
the
mountain
and
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
for
him
to
gather
fuel
for
a
fire
but
he
considered
the
candle
flame
which
he
carried
very
sacred
and
did
not
wish
to
light
anything
from
it
except
the
candles
before
the
blessed
virgin
s
altar
the
storm
increased
and
at
last
he
heard
thunder
and
saw
gleams
of
lightning
then
came
a
flash
which
struck
the
mountain
just
in
front
of
the
tomb
and
set
fire
to
a
tree
and
in
this
way
he
was
enabled
to
light
his
fire
without
having
to
borrow
of
the
sacred
flame
as
raniero
was
riding
on
through
a
desolate
portion
of
the
cilician
mountain
district
his
candles
were
all
used
up
the
candles
which
he
had
brought
with
him
from
jerusalem
had
long
since
been
consumed
but
still
he
had
been
able
to
manage
because
he
had
found
christian
communities
all
along
the
way
of
whom
he
had
begged
fresh
candles
but
now
his
resources
were
exhausted
and
he
thought
that
this
would
be
the
end
of
his
journey
when
the
candle
was
so
nearly
burned
out
that
the
flame
scorched
his
hand
he
jumped
from
his
horse
and
gathered
branches
and
dry
leaves
and
lit
these
with
the
last
of
the
flame
but
up
on
the
mountain
there
was
very
little
that
would
ignite
and
the
fire
would
soon
burn
out
while
he
sat
and
grieved
because
the
sacred
flame
must
die
he
heard
singing
down
the
road
and
a
procession
of
pilgrims
came
marching
up
the
steep
path
bearing
candles
in
their
hands
they
were
on
their
way
to
a
grotto
where
a
holy
man
had
lived
and
raniero
followed
them
among
them
was
a
woman
who
was
very
old
and
had
difficulty
in
walking
and
raniero
carried
her
up
the
mountain
when
she
thanked
him
afterwards
he
made
a
sign
to
her
that
she
should
give
him
her
candle
she
did
so
and
several
others
also
presented
him
with
the
candles
which
they
carried
he
extinguished
the
candles
hurried
down
the
steep
path
and
lit
one
of
them
with
the
last
spark
from
the
fire
lighted
by
the
sacred
flame
one
day
at
the
noon
hour
it
was
very
warm
and
raniero
had
lain
down
to
sleep
in
a
thicket
he
slept
soundly
and
the
candle
stood
beside
him
between
a
couple
of
stones
when
he
had
been
asleep
a
while
it
began
to
rain
and
this
continued
for
some
time
without
his
waking
when
at
last
he
was
startled
out
of
his
sleep
the
ground
around
him
was
wet
and
he
hardly
dared
glance
toward
the
light
for
fear
it
might
be
quenched
but
the
light
burned
calmly
and
steadily
in
the
rain
and
raniero
saw
that
this
was
because
two
little
birds
flew
and
fluttered
just
above
the
flame
they
caressed
it
with
their
bills
and
held
their
wings
outspread
and
in
this
way
they
protected
the
sacred
flame
from
the
rain
he
took
off
his
hood
immediately
and
hung
it
over
the
candle
thereupon
he
reached
out
his
hand
for
the
two
little
birds
for
he
had
been
seized
with
a
desire
to
pet
them
neither
of
them
flew
away
because
of
him
and
he
could
catch
them
he
was
very
much
astonished
that
the
birds
were
not
afraid
of
him
it
is
because
they
know
i
have
no
thought
except
to
protect
that
which
is
the
most
sensitive
of
all
that
they
do
not
fear
me
thought
he
raniero
rode
in
the
vicinity
of
nicæa
in
bithynia
here
he
met
some
western
gentlemen
who
were
conducting
a
party
of
recruits
to
the
holy
land
in
this
company
was
robert
taillefer
who
was
a
wandering
knight
and
a
troubadour
raniero
in
his
torn
cloak
came
riding
along
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
and
the
warriors
began
as
usual
to
shout
a
madman
a
madman
but
robert
silenced
them
and
addressed
the
rider
have
you
journeyed
far
in
this
manner
he
asked
i
have
ridden
like
this
all
the
way
from
jerusalem
answered
raniero
has
your
light
been
extinguished
many
times
during
the
journey
still
burns
the
flame
that
lighted
the
candle
with
which
i
rode
away
from
jerusalem
responded
raniero
then
robert
taillefer
said
to
him
i
am
also
one
of
those
who
carry
a
light
and
i
would
that
it
burned
always
but
perchance
you
who
have
brought
your
light
burning
all
the
way
from
jerusalem
can
tell
me
what
i
shall
do
that
it
may
not
become
extinguished
then
raniero
answered
master
it
is
a
difficult
task
although
it
appears
to
be
of
slight
importance
this
little
flame
demands
of
you
that
you
shall
entirely
cease
to
think
of
anything
else
it
will
not
allow
you
to
have
any
case
you
should
desire
anything
of
the
would
you
dare
on
account
of
this
flame
to
sit
down
at
a
revel
you
can
not
have
aught
else
in
your
thoughts
than
just
this
flame
and
must
possess
no
other
happiness
but
my
chief
reason
for
advising
you
against
making
the
journey
which
i
have
weathered
is
that
you
can
not
for
an
instant
feel
secure
it
matters
not
through
how
many
perils
you
may
have
guarded
the
flame
you
can
not
for
an
instant
think
yourself
secure
but
must
ever
expect
that
the
very
next
moment
it
may
fail
but
robert
taillefer
raised
his
head
proudly
and
answered
what
you
have
done
for
your
sacred
flame
i
may
do
for
raniero
arrived
in
italy
one
day
he
rode
through
lonely
roads
up
among
the
mountains
a
woman
came
running
after
him
and
begged
him
to
give
her
a
light
from
his
candle
the
fire
in
my
hut
is
out
said
she
my
children
are
hungry
give
me
a
light
that
i
may
heat
my
oven
and
bake
bread
for
them
she
reached
for
the
burning
candle
but
raniero
held
it
back
because
he
did
not
wish
that
anything
should
be
lighted
by
that
flame
but
the
candles
before
the
image
of
the
blessed
virgin
then
the
woman
said
to
him
pilgrim
give
me
a
light
for
the
life
of
my
children
is
the
flame
which
i
am
in
duty
bound
to
keep
burning
and
because
of
these
words
he
permitted
her
to
light
the
wick
of
her
lamp
from
his
flame
several
hours
later
he
rode
into
a
town
it
lay
far
up
on
the
mountain
where
it
was
very
cold
a
peasant
stood
in
the
road
and
saw
the
poor
wretch
who
came
riding
in
his
torn
cloak
instantly
he
stripped
off
the
short
mantle
which
he
wore
and
flung
it
to
him
but
the
mantle
fell
directly
over
the
candle
and
extinguished
the
flame
then
raniero
remembered
the
woman
who
had
borrowed
a
light
of
him
he
turned
back
to
her
and
had
his
candle
lighted
anew
with
sacred
fire
when
he
was
ready
to
ride
farther
he
said
to
her
you
say
that
the
sacred
flame
which
you
must
guard
is
the
life
of
your
children
can
you
tell
me
what
name
this
candle
s
flame
bears
which
i
have
carried
over
long
roads
where
was
your
candle
lighted
asked
the
woman
it
was
lighted
at
christ
s
sepulchre
said
raniero
then
it
can
only
be
called
gentleness
and
love
of
humanity
said
she
raniero
laughed
at
the
answer
he
thought
himself
a
singular
apostle
of
virtues
such
as
these
raniero
rode
forward
between
beautiful
blue
hills
he
saw
he
was
near
florence
he
was
thinking
that
he
must
soon
part
with
his
light
he
thought
of
his
tent
in
jerusalem
which
he
had
left
filled
with
trophies
and
the
brave
soldiers
who
were
still
in
palestine
and
who
would
be
glad
to
have
him
take
up
the
business
of
war
once
more
and
bear
them
on
to
new
conquests
and
honors
then
he
perceived
that
he
experienced
no
pleasure
in
thinking
of
this
but
that
his
thoughts
were
drawn
in
another
direction
then
he
realized
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
no
longer
the
same
man
that
had
gone
from
jerusalem
the
ride
with
the
sacred
flame
had
compelled
him
to
rejoice
with
all
who
were
peaceable
and
wise
and
compassionate
and
to
abhor
the
savage
and
warlike
he
was
happy
every
time
he
thought
of
people
who
labored
peacefully
in
their
homes
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
willingly
move
into
his
old
workshop
in
florence
and
do
beautiful
and
artistic
work
verily
this
flame
has
recreated
me
he
thought
i
believe
it
has
made
a
new
man
of
v
it
was
eastertide
when
raniero
rode
into
florence
he
had
scarcely
come
in
through
the
city
backwards
with
his
hood
drawn
down
over
his
face
and
the
burning
candle
in
his
a
beggar
arose
and
shouted
the
customary
pazzo
pazzo
at
this
cry
a
street
gamin
darted
out
of
a
doorway
and
a
loafer
who
had
had
nothing
else
to
do
for
a
long
time
than
to
lie
and
gaze
at
the
clouds
jumped
to
his
feet
both
began
shouting
the
same
thing
pazzo
pazzo
now
that
there
were
three
who
shrieked
they
made
a
good
deal
of
noise
and
so
woke
up
all
the
street
urchins
they
came
rushing
out
from
nooks
and
corners
as
soon
as
they
saw
raniero
in
his
torn
coat
on
the
wretched
horse
they
shouted
pazzo
pazzo
but
this
was
only
what
raniero
was
accustomed
to
he
rode
quietly
up
the
street
seeming
not
to
notice
the
shouters
then
they
were
not
content
with
merely
shouting
but
one
of
them
jumped
up
and
tried
to
blow
out
the
light
raniero
raised
the
candle
on
high
trying
at
the
same
time
to
prod
his
horse
to
escape
the
boys
they
kept
even
pace
with
him
and
did
everything
they
could
to
put
out
the
light
the
more
he
exerted
himself
to
protect
the
flame
the
more
excited
they
became
they
leaped
upon
one
another
s
backs
puffed
their
cheeks
out
and
blew
they
flung
their
caps
at
the
candle
it
was
only
because
they
were
so
numerous
and
crowded
on
one
another
that
they
did
not
succeed
in
quenching
the
flame
this
was
the
largest
procession
on
the
street
people
stood
at
the
windows
and
laughed
no
one
felt
any
sympathy
with
a
madman
who
wanted
to
defend
his
candle
flame
it
was
church
hour
and
many
worshipers
were
on
their
way
to
mass
they
too
stopped
and
laughed
at
the
sport
but
now
raniero
stood
upright
in
the
saddle
so
that
he
could
shield
the
candle
he
looked
wild
the
hood
had
fallen
back
and
they
saw
his
face
which
was
wasted
and
pale
like
a
martyr
s
the
candle
he
held
uplifted
as
high
as
he
could
the
entire
street
was
one
great
swarm
of
people
even
the
older
ones
began
to
take
part
in
the
play
the
women
waved
their
and
the
men
swung
their
caps
every
one
worked
to
extinguish
the
light
raniero
rode
under
the
balcony
of
a
house
upon
this
stood
a
woman
she
leaned
over
the
snatched
the
candle
and
ran
in
with
it
the
woman
was
francesca
degli
uberti
the
whole
populace
burst
into
shrieks
of
laughter
and
shouts
but
raniero
swayed
in
his
saddle
and
fell
to
the
street
as
soon
as
he
lay
there
stricken
and
unconscious
the
street
was
emptied
of
people
no
one
wished
to
take
charge
of
the
fallen
man
his
horse
was
the
only
creature
that
stopped
beside
him
as
soon
as
the
crowds
had
got
away
from
the
street
francesca
degli
uberti
came
out
from
her
house
with
the
burning
candle
in
her
hand
she
was
still
pretty
her
features
were
gentle
and
her
eyes
were
deep
and
earnest
she
went
up
to
raniero
and
bent
over
him
he
lay
senseless
but
the
instant
the
candle
light
fell
upon
his
face
he
moved
and
roused
himself
it
was
apparent
that
the
candle
flame
had
complete
power
over
him
when
francesca
saw
that
he
had
regained
his
senses
she
said
here
is
your
candle
i
snatched
it
from
you
as
i
saw
how
anxious
you
were
to
keep
it
burning
i
knew
of
no
other
way
to
help
raniero
had
had
a
bad
fall
and
was
hurt
but
now
nothing
could
hold
him
back
he
began
to
raise
himself
slowly
he
wanted
to
walk
but
wavered
and
was
about
to
fall
then
he
tried
to
mount
his
horse
francesca
helped
him
where
do
you
wish
to
go
she
asked
when
he
sat
in
the
saddle
again
i
want
to
go
to
the
cathedral
he
answered
then
i
shall
accompany
you
she
said
for
i
m
going
to
and
she
led
the
horse
for
him
francesca
had
recognized
raniero
the
very
moment
she
saw
him
but
he
did
not
see
who
she
was
for
he
did
not
take
time
to
notice
her
he
kept
his
gaze
fixed
upon
the
candle
flame
alone
they
were
absolutely
silent
all
the
way
raniero
thought
only
of
the
flame
and
of
guarding
it
well
these
last
moments
francesca
could
not
speak
for
she
felt
she
did
not
wish
to
be
certain
of
that
which
she
feared
she
could
not
believe
but
that
raniero
had
come
home
insane
although
she
was
almost
certain
of
this
she
would
rather
not
speak
with
him
in
order
to
avoid
any
positive
assurance
after
a
while
raniero
heard
some
one
weep
near
him
he
looked
around
and
saw
that
it
was
francesca
degli
uberti
who
walked
beside
him
and
she
wept
but
raniero
saw
her
only
for
an
instant
and
said
nothing
to
her
he
wanted
to
think
only
of
the
sacred
flame
raniero
let
her
conduct
him
to
the
sacristy
there
he
dismounted
he
thanked
francesca
for
her
help
but
looked
all
the
while
not
upon
her
but
on
the
light
he
walked
alone
up
to
the
priests
in
the
sacristy
francesca
went
into
the
church
it
was
easter
eve
and
all
the
candles
stood
unlighted
upon
the
altars
as
a
symbol
of
mourning
francesca
thought
that
every
flame
of
hope
which
had
ever
burned
within
her
was
now
extinguished
in
the
church
there
was
profound
solemnity
there
were
many
priests
at
the
altar
the
canons
sat
in
a
body
in
the
chancel
with
the
bishop
among
them
by
and
by
francesca
noticed
there
was
commotion
among
the
priests
nearly
all
who
were
not
needed
to
serve
at
mass
arose
and
went
out
into
the
sacristy
finally
the
bishop
went
too
when
mass
was
over
a
priest
stepped
up
to
the
chancel
railing
and
began
to
speak
to
the
people
he
related
that
raniero
di
raniero
had
arrived
in
florence
with
sacred
fire
from
jerusalem
he
narrated
what
the
rider
had
endured
and
suffered
on
the
way
and
he
praised
him
exceeding
much
the
people
sat
spellbound
and
listened
to
this
francesca
had
never
before
experienced
such
a
blissful
moment
o
god
she
sighed
this
is
greater
happiness
than
i
can
her
tears
fell
as
she
listened
the
priest
talked
long
and
well
finally
he
said
in
a
strong
thrilling
voice
it
may
perchance
appear
like
a
trivial
thing
now
that
a
candle
flame
has
been
brought
to
florence
but
i
say
to
you
pray
god
that
he
will
send
florence
many
bearers
of
eternal
light
then
she
will
become
a
great
power
and
be
extolled
as
a
city
among
cities
when
the
priest
had
finished
speaking
the
entrance
doors
of
the
church
were
thrown
open
and
a
procession
of
canons
and
monks
and
priests
marched
up
the
center
aisle
toward
the
altar
the
bishop
came
last
and
by
his
side
walked
raniero
in
the
same
cloak
that
he
had
worn
during
the
entire
journey
but
when
raniero
had
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
cathedral
an
old
man
arose
and
walked
toward
him
it
was
oddo
the
father
of
the
journeyman
who
had
once
worked
for
raniero
and
had
hanged
himself
because
of
him
when
this
man
had
come
up
to
the
bishop
and
raniero
he
bowed
to
them
thereupon
he
said
in
such
a
loud
voice
that
all
in
the
church
heard
him
it
is
a
great
thing
for
florence
that
raniero
has
come
with
sacred
fire
from
jerusalem
such
a
thing
has
never
before
been
heard
of
or
conceived
for
that
reason
perhaps
there
may
be
many
who
will
say
that
it
is
not
possible
therefore
i
beg
that
all
the
people
may
know
what
proofs
and
witnesses
raniero
has
brought
with
him
to
assure
us
that
this
is
actually
fire
which
was
lighted
in
when
raniero
heard
this
he
said
god
help
me
how
can
i
produce
witnesses
i
have
made
the
journey
alone
deserts
and
mountain
wastes
must
come
and
testify
for
raniero
is
an
honest
knight
said
the
bishop
and
we
believe
him
on
his
raniero
must
know
himself
that
doubts
will
arise
as
to
this
said
oddo
surely
he
can
not
have
ridden
entirely
alone
his
little
pages
could
certainly
testify
for
then
francesca
degli
uberti
rushed
up
to
raniero
why
need
we
witnesses
said
she
all
the
women
in
florence
would
swear
on
oath
that
raniero
speaks
the
truth
then
raniero
smiled
and
his
countenance
brightened
for
a
moment
thereupon
he
turned
his
thoughts
and
his
gaze
once
more
upon
the
candle
flame
there
was
great
commotion
in
the
church
some
said
that
raniero
should
not
be
allowed
to
light
the
candles
on
the
altar
until
his
claim
was
substantiated
with
this
many
of
his
old
enemies
sided
then
jacopo
degli
uberti
rose
and
spoke
in
raniero
s
behalf
i
believe
every
one
here
knows
that
no
very
great
friendship
has
existed
between
my
and
me
he
said
but
now
both
my
sons
and
i
will
answer
for
him
we
believe
he
has
performed
this
task
and
we
know
that
one
who
has
been
disposed
to
carry
out
such
an
undertaking
is
a
wise
discreet
and
man
whom
we
are
glad
to
receive
among
but
oddo
and
many
others
were
not
disposed
to
let
him
taste
of
the
bliss
he
was
yearning
for
they
got
together
in
a
close
group
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
they
did
not
care
to
withdraw
their
demand
raniero
apprehended
that
if
this
should
develop
into
a
fight
they
would
immediately
try
to
get
at
the
candle
as
he
kept
his
eyes
steadily
fixed
upon
his
opponents
he
raised
the
candle
as
high
as
he
could
he
looked
exhausted
in
the
extreme
and
distraught
one
could
see
that
although
he
wished
to
hold
out
to
the
very
last
he
expected
defeat
what
mattered
it
to
him
now
if
he
were
permitted
to
light
the
candles
oddo
s
word
had
been
a
when
doubt
was
once
awakened
it
would
spread
and
increase
he
fancied
that
oddo
had
already
extinguished
the
sacred
flame
forever
a
little
bird
came
fluttering
through
the
great
open
doors
into
the
church
it
flew
straight
into
raniero
s
light
he
hadn
t
time
to
snatch
it
aside
and
the
bird
dashed
against
it
and
put
out
the
flame
raniero
s
arm
dropped
and
tears
sprang
to
his
eyes
the
first
moment
he
felt
this
as
a
sort
of
relief
it
was
better
thus
than
if
human
beings
had
killed
it
the
little
bird
continued
its
flight
into
the
church
fluttering
confusedly
hither
and
thither
as
birds
do
when
they
come
into
a
room
simultaneously
a
loud
cry
resounded
throughout
the
church
the
bird
is
on
fire
the
sacred
candle
flame
has
set
its
wings
on
fire
the
little
bird
chirped
anxiously
for
a
few
moments
it
fluttered
about
like
a
flickering
flame
under
the
high
chancel
arches
then
it
sank
suddenly
and
dropped
dead
upon
the
madonna
s
altar
but
the
moment
the
bird
fell
upon
the
altar
raniero
was
standing
there
he
had
forced
his
way
through
the
church
no
one
had
been
able
to
stop
him
from
the
sparks
which
destroyed
the
bird
s
wings
he
lit
the
candles
before
the
madonna
s
altar
then
the
bishop
raised
his
staff
and
proclaimed
god
willed
it
god
hath
testified
for
him
and
all
the
people
in
the
church
both
his
friends
and
opponents
abandoned
their
doubts
and
conjectures
they
cried
as
with
one
voice
transported
by
god
s
miracle
god
willed
it
god
hath
testified
for
him
of
raniero
there
is
now
only
a
legend
which
says
he
enjoyed
great
good
fortune
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
and
was
wise
and
prudent
and
compassionate
but
the
people
of
florence
always
called
him
pazzo
degli
ranieri
in
remembrance
of
the
fact
that
they
had
believed
him
insane
and
this
became
his
honorary
title
he
founded
a
dynasty
which
was
named
pazzi
and
is
called
so
even
to
this
day
it
might
also
be
worth
mentioning
that
it
became
a
custom
in
florence
each
year
at
easter
eve
to
celebrate
a
festival
in
memory
of
raniero
s
with
the
sacred
flame
and
that
on
this
occasion
they
always
let
an
artificial
bird
fly
with
fire
through
the
church
this
festival
would
most
likely
have
been
celebrated
even
in
our
day
had
not
some
changes
taken
place
recently
but
if
it
be
true
as
many
hold
that
the
bearers
of
sacred
fire
who
have
lived
in
florence
and
have
made
the
city
one
of
the
most
glorious
on
earth
have
taken
raniero
as
their
model
and
have
thereby
been
encouraged
to
sacrifice
to
suffer
and
endure
this
may
here
be
left
untold
for
what
has
been
done
by
this
light
which
in

times
has
