jerking
a

from
beneath
the
windshield
of
the
shiny
new

penny
parker
turned
flashing
blue
eyes
upon
her
companion
louise
sidell
well
penny
responded
her
chum
dryly
in
riverview
persons
who
park
their
cars
beside
fire
hydrants
usually
expect
to
get
parking
tickets
but
we
were
only
inside
the
drugstore
five
minutes
would
you
think
a
policeman
could
find
something
else
to
do
oh
the
ticket
wo
cost
you
more
than
five
or
ten
dollars
teased
louise
wickedly
your
father
should
pay
it
he
should
but
he
wo
penny
answered
gloomily
dad
expects
his
one
and
only
daughter
to
assume
her
own
car
expense
i
ask
you
what
the
good
of
having
a
weekly
allowance
when
you
never
get
to
use
it
yourself
you
in
a
mood
today
why
i
think
you
lucky
to
have
a
grand
new
car
louise
glance
caressed
the
highly
polished
chrome
plate
the
sleek
streamlined
body
which
shone
in
the
sunlight
the
automobile
had
been
presented
to
penny
by
her
father
anthony
parker
largely
in
gratitude
because
she
had
saved
his
newspaper
riverview
from
a
disastrous
law
suit
yes
i
am
lucky
penny
agreed
without
enthusiasm
all
the
same
lonesome
for
my
old
coupe
leaping
lena
i
wish
i
could
have
kept
her
she
was
traded
in
on
this
model
what
would
you
do
with
that
old
wreck
now
penny
nearly
every
time
we
went
around
a
corner
it
broke
down
all
the
same
we
had
marvelous
times
with
her
this
car
takes
twice
as
much
gasoline
another
thing
all
the
policemen
knew
lena
they
never
gave
her
a
ticket
for
anything
penny
sighed
deeply
pocketing
the
yellow
card
she
squeezed
behind
the
steering
wheel
by
the
way
whatever
became
of
lena
louise
asked
curiously
slamming
the
car
door
she
glanced
sharply
at
penny
oh
she
changed
hands
twice
now
she
at
jake
harriman
lot
advertised
for
fifty
dollars
want
to
drive
past
there
not
particularly
but
i
do
it
for
your
sake
pet
as
the
car
started
toward
the
harriman
car
lot
louise
stole
an
amused
glance
at
her
chum
penny
was
not
unattractive
even
when
submerged
in
gloom
upon
the
slightest
provocation
her
blue
eyes
sparkled
her
smile
when
she
chose
to
turn
it
on
would
melt
a
man
of
stone
she
dressed
carelessly
brushed
a
mop
of
curly
golden
hair
only
if
it
suited
her
fancy
yet
somehow
achieved
an
appearance
envied
by
her
friends
the
automobile
drew
up
at
the
curb
there
lena
penny
pointed
to
an
ancient
blue
coupe
with
battered
fenders
which
stood
on
the
crowded
lot
a
sign
on
the
windshield
informed
the
public
that
the
auto
might
be
bought
for
forty
dollars
lena
value
seems
to
have
dropped
ten
dollars
commented
louise
my
i
had
forgotten
how
wrecky
the
old
thing
looks
do
speak
of
her
so
disrespectfully
lou
all
she
needs
is
a
good
waxing
and
a
little
paint
the
girls
crossed
the
lot
to
inspect
the
coupe
as
they
were
gazing
at
it
jake
the
lot
owner
sidled
toward
them
beaming
ingratiatingly
good
afternoon
young
ladies
may
i
interest
you
in
a
car
no
thank
you
replied
penny
we
just
looking
now
here
is
a
fine
car
went
on
the
dealer
indicating
the
coupe
a
model
good
mechanical
condition
nice
rubber
a
lively
battery
and
fair
paint
you
ca
go
wrong
ladies
not
at
a
price
of
forty
dollars
but
will
it
run
asked
louise
smothering
a
giggle
there
thousands
of
miles
of
good
service
left
in
this
little
car
ladies
and
the
price
is
only
fifteen
dollars
above
the
junk
value
the
thought
of
leaping
lena
coming
to
an
inglorious
end
in
a
junk
yard
was
disconcerting
to
penny
she
walked
slowly
about
the
car
inspecting
it
from
every
angle
forty
dollars
is
too
much
for
this
old
wreck
she
said
firmly
why
penny
such
disrespect
mocked
louise
penny
frowned
down
her
chum
sentiment
and
business
were
two
different
matters
what
you
give
inquired
the
car
owner
alertly
not
a
cent
over
louise
clutched
penny
arm
trying
to
pull
her
away
have
you
lost
your
mind
she
demanded
what
could
you
do
with
this
old
car
when
you
already
have
a
new
one
penny
did
not
listen
she
kept
gazing
at
the
coupe
as
one
who
had
been
hypnotized
i
take
it
in
a
minute
only
i
do
have
dollars
in
cash
how
much
can
you
raise
asked
the
dealer
not
more
than
five
dollars
i
afraid
but
my
father
is
publisher
of
the
jake
harriman
brows
unknitted
as
if
by
magic
anthony
parker
daughter
he
said
smiling
that
plenty
good
enough
for
me
i
sell
you
the
best
car
on
the
lot
for
nothing
down
just
come
inside
the
office
and
sign
a
note
for
the
amount
will
that
be
okay
disregarding
louise
whispered
protests
penny
assured
the
dealer
that
the
arrangement
would
be
perfectly
satisfactory
the
note
was
signed
and
five
dollars
in
cash
given
to
bind
the
bargain
i
throw
in
a
few
gallons
of
gas
the
man
offered
however
jake
harriman
gasoline
did
not
seem
suited
to
leaping
dyspeptic
ignition
she
coughed
feebly
once
or
twice
and
then
died
for
the
day
you
have
acquired
a
bargain
i
must
say
exclaimed
louise
you
even
get
the
car
home
yes
i
can
penny
insisted
i
tow
her
a
little
tinkering
and
she
be
as
good
as
new
you
optimistic
to
say
the
least
laughed
louise
penny
produced
a
steel
cable
from
the
tool
kit
of
the
maroon
sedan
and
jake
harriman
coupled
the
two
cars
together
penny
what
will
your
father
say
when
he
learns
of
this
louise
inquired
dubiously
on
top
of
a
parking
ticket
too
oh
i
meet
that
problem
when
i
come
to
it
penny
answered
carelessly
louise
you
steer
lena
i
drive
the
sedan
shaking
her
head
sadly
louise
climbed
into
the
old
car
although
penny
was
her
dearest
friend
she
was
forced
to
admit
that
the
girl
often
did
bewildering
things
penny
mother
was
dead
and
for
many
years
she
had
been
raised
by
a
housekeeper
maud
weems
secretly
louise
wondered
if
it
were
not
the
housekeeper
who
had
been
trained
at
any
rate
penny
enjoyed
unusual
freedom
for
a
high
school
girl
and
her
philosophy
of
life
was
summed
up
in
one
headline
action
penny
put
the
sedan
in
gear
towing
the
coupe
slowly
down
the
street
the
two
vehicles
traveled
several
blocks
before
a
hill
loomed
ahead
penny
considered
turning
back
and
then
decided
that
the
cars
could
make
the
steep
climb
easily
however
midway
up
the
hill
the
sedan
suddenly
leaped
forward
as
if
released
from
a
heavy
burden
at
the
same
instant
lena
horn
gave
a
sharp
warning
blast
glancing
into
the
mirror
penny
was
horrified
to
see
leaping
lena
careening
backwards
down
the
steep
slope
the
tow
rope
had
unfastened
bringing
the
sedan
to
the
curb
she
jerked
on
the
hand
brake
and
sprang
to
the
pavement
louise
bewildered
and
frightened
was
trying
desperately
to
control
the
coupe
the
car
gathered
speed
wobbling
crazily
toward
the
line
of
traffic
guide
it
guide
it
shouted
penny
put
on
the
brakes
so
confused
was
louise
that
she
lost
her
head
completely
straight
toward
a
long
black
limousine
rolled
the
coupe
the
chauffeur
spun
his
wheel
but
too
late
there
was
a
loud
crash
as
the
two
cars
came
together
penny
raced
down
the
hill
to
help
her
chum
from
the
coupe
are
you
hurt
she
asked
anxiously
louise
shook
her
head
wailing
penny
parker
just
see
what
has
happened
now
you
never
should
have
bought
this
stupid
old
wreck
both
the
chauffeur
and
an
elderly
gentleman
who
carried
a
cane
alighted
from
the
limousine
with
grim
faces
they
surveyed
the
fender
which
had
been
crushed
the
owner
is
kohl
louise
whispered
nervously
you
know
president
of
the
first
national
bank
the
banker
did
not
recognize
either
of
the
girls
addressing
them
both
he
made
several
pointed
remarks
to
the
effect
that
irresponsible
young
people
were
very
thoughtless
to
endanger
the
property
of
others
with
their
ancient
jalopies
it
was
entirely
my
fault
kohl
acknowledged
penny
meekly
of
course
i
pay
for
the
fender
the
banker
softened
somewhat
gazing
at
the
girls
in
a
thoughtful
more
friendly
way
have
i
seen
you
somewhere
before
he
asked
oh
yes
mr
kohl
penny
was
quick
to
press
for
an
advantage
why
i
am
one
of
your
best
customers
ever
since
i
was
six
years
old
trusted
your
bank
with
my
savings
i
remember
you
now
said
kohl
smiling
you
the
parker
girl
adding
a
mental
note
that
anthony
parker
actually
was
one
of
the
largest
depositors
he
decided
it
would
be
excellent
policy
to
make
light
of
the
accident
a
moment
later
as
a
policeman
came
to
investigate
he
insisted
that
the
incident
had
been
unavoidable
and
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
arrest
the
girls
kohl
you
were
noble
absolutely
noble
declared
penny
gratefully
after
the
policeman
had
gone
the
least
i
can
do
is
to
pay
for
the
damage
i
stop
at
sherman
garage
and
have
a
new
fender
put
on
the
banker
responded
the
bill
can
be
sent
to
your
father
after
kohl
had
driven
away
louise
helped
penny
hook
the
coupe
to
the
sedan
once
more
she
remarked
cuttingly
you
done
right
well
today
one
parking
ticket
a
bill
for
dollars
and
another
one
coming
up
just
what
your
father
say
plenty
sighed
penny
i
wonder
if
it
might
not
be
a
good
idea
to
break
the
news
by
easy
stages
perhaps
he
take
it
more
calmly
if
i
telephone
do
be
too
sure
the
street
was
a
narrow
dingy
one
with
few
business
houses
noticing
a
japanese
store
which
bore
a
sign
kano
curio
shop
she
started
toward
it
intending
to
seek
a
public
telephone
louise
seized
her
arm
penny
you
not
going
in
there
why
not
this
is
dorr
street
one
of
the
worst
places
in
riverview
oh
do
be
silly
chuckled
penny
it
perfectly
safe
by
daylight
i
go
alone
if
you
afraid
thus
challenged
louise
indignantly
denied
that
she
was
afraid
and
accompanied
her
chum
the
door
of
kano
shop
stood
invitingly
open
pausing
on
the
threshold
the
girls
caught
a
pleasant
aroma
of
sandalwood
so
quietly
did
louise
and
penny
enter
that
the
elderly
shop
owner
did
not
immediately
see
them
he
sat
behind
a
high
counter
engrossed
in
something
he
was
sewing
good
afternoon
said
penny
pleasantly
the
japanese
glanced
up
quickly
and
as
quickly
thrust
his
work
beneath
the
counter
recovering
poise
he
bowed
to
the
girls
may
we
use
your
telephone
if
you
have
one
penny
requested
so
very
sorry
miss
the
japanese
responded
bowing
again
have
no
telephone
penny
nodded
absently
fingering
a
tray
of
tiny
ivory
figures
the
japanese
watched
her
and
mistaking
curiosity
for
buying
interest
brought
additional
pieces
for
her
to
inspect
the
curios
were
all
too
expensive
for
penny
purse
but
after
endless
debate
she
bought
a
pair
of
wooden
clogs
the
shop
owner
padded
away
into
a
back
room
intending
to
wrap
the
package
for
her
scarcely
had
he
vanished
when
penny
turned
excitedly
to
her
chum
lou
did
you
notice
how
funny
he
acted
when
we
came
in
here
yes
he
did
want
us
to
see
what
he
was
making
evidently
exactly
what
i
thought
but
we
fool
mr
kano
giving
louise
no
opportunity
to
protest
penny
boldly
peered
behind
the
counter
here
it
is
she
whispered
but
is
it
hidden
in
a
pasteboard
box
lay
coil
upon
coil
of
what
appeared
to
be
fine
black
silk
rope
curiously
she
lifted
it
up
exposing
a
network
of
crossbars
well
of
all
things
she
exclaimed
it
a
ladder
lou
a
ladder
made
of
silk
chapter
rope
of
even
as
penny
spoke
she
felt
a
hard
warning
tug
on
her
skirt
quickly
she
turned
around
in
the
doorway
stood
the
old
japanese
his
smile
was
not
pleasant
to
behold
were
just
looking
at
this
rope
penny
stammered
trying
to
carry
off
the
situation
with
dignity
i
hope
you
do
mind
the
japanese
shopkeeper
gazed
steadily
at
the
girl
his
face
an
emotionless
mask
since
he
spoke
no
word
it
became
increasingly
evident
that
he
regarded
her
with
anger
and
suspicion
may
i
ask
what
use
is
made
of
this
silk
rope
penny
inquired
do
you
sell
it
for
a
special
purpose
the
japanese
coldly
ignored
the
direct
questions
so
very
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
he
said
softly
your
change
please
penny
knew
that
she
deserved
the
rebuke
accepting
the
package
and
coins
she
and
louise
hastily
left
the
shop
not
until
they
were
some
distance
away
did
the
latter
speak
penny
you
would
do
a
trick
like
that
one
of
these
days
your
curiosity
will
get
us
into
serious
trouble
at
least
i
learned
what
was
hidden
behind
the
counter
chuckled
penny
but
that
jap
did
seem
very
eager
to
answer
my
questions
can
you
blame
him
it
certainly
was
none
of
our
affair
what
he
kept
inside
the
box
perhaps
not
lou
but
you
must
admit
he
acted
strangely
when
we
first
entered
the
shop
you
know
as
if
we
had
surprised
him
in
a
questionable
act
he
naturally
was
startled
we
came
in
so
quietly
all
the
same
i
not
one
bit
sorry
i
looked
behind
the
counter
penny
maintained
i
like
to
learn
about
things
i
agree
with
you
there
lou
what
purpose
do
you
suppose
silk
ladders
serve
who
uses
them
and
why
now
how
should
i
know
penny
you
ask
enough
questions
to
be
master
of
ceremonies
on
a
radio
quiz
program
i
ca
recall
ever
having
seen
a
silk
ladder
before
penny
resumed
undisturbed
by
her
chum
quip
would
acrobats
use
them
do
you
think
not
to
my
knowledge
louise
answered
if
i
were
in
your
shoes
i
should
worry
about
more
serious
matters
than
those
connected
with
a
mere
silk
ladder
the
world
is
filled
with
serious
things
sighed
penny
but
mystery
one
does
run
into
it
every
day
you
do
said
louise
brutally
if
a
stranger
twitches
his
ears
twice
you
immediately
suspect
him
of
villainy
nevertheless
being
of
a
suspicious
nature
won
me
a
new
car
penny
defended
herself
do
forget
dad
gave
it
to
me
for
solving
a
mystery
for
telling
his
newspaper
readers
what
was
going
on
the
green
oh
your
curiosity
has
paid
dividends
louise
admitted
with
a
laugh
take
for
instance
the
time
you
trailed
the
and
again
when
you
lowered
the
kippenberg
drawbridge
to
capture
a
boatload
of
crooks
those
were
the
days
why
dwell
in
the
past
lou
now
take
this
affair
of
the
silk
ladder
i
afraid
have
to
take
it
louise
interrupted
do
you
realize
it
nearly
four
in
exactly
ten
minutes
i
am
supposed
to
be
at
the
auditorium
for
orchestra
practice
lou
you
ca
desert
me
now
penny
protested
quickly
how
will
i
get
lena
home
i
need
you
to
steer
her
thanks
but
i
do
trust
your
tow
rope
at
least
go
as
far
as
the
office
with
me
once
there
maybe
i
can
get
one
of
the
reporters
to
help
me
the
rest
of
the
way
oh
all
right
louise
consented
but
the
office
is
my
absolute
limit
deciding
not
to
take
time
to
telephone
her
father
penny
once
more
climbed
into
the
maroon
sedan
posting
louise
behind
the
wheel
of
the
coupe
at
a
cautious
speed
the
two
cars
proceeded
along
the
street
coming
presently
to
a
large
corner
building
which
housed
the
no
parking
space
being
available
on
the
street
penny
pulled
into
the
newspaper
plant
loading
dock
say
you
shouted
a
man
who
was
tossing
stacks
of
freshly
inked
papers
into
a
truck
you
ca
park
that
caravan
in
here
penny
eyes
danced
mischievously
oh
it
quite
all
right
she
said
i
guess
you
do
know
who
i
am
sure
i
do
the
trucker
grinned
but
your
dad
gave
orders
that
the
next
time
you
tried
to
pull
that
stuff
we
were
to
bounce
you
this
dock
is
for
trucks
why
the
very
idea
said
penny
with
pretended
injury
the
night
edition
does
roll
for
an
hour
and
i
be
away
from
here
before
then
besides
this
is
a
great
emergency
when
dad
hears
about
all
the
trouble
i
in
a
little
matter
such
as
this
wo
even
ruffle
him
okay
chase
along
the
trucker
returned
but
see
to
it
that
you
out
of
here
within
an
hour
penny
bade
louise
and
with
plaid
skirt
swinging
jauntily
crossed
the
cement
runway
to
the
rear
elevator
entrance
without
waiting
for
the
cage
to
descend
she
took
the
steps
two
at
a
time
arriving
at
the
editorial
floor
gasping
for
breath
what
your
rush
inquired
an
amused
voice
going
to
a
fire
jerry
livingston
ace
reporter
for
the
leaned
indolently
against
the
grillwork
of
the
elevator
shaft
his
finger
pressed
on
the
signal
button
he
and
penny
were
friends
of
long
standing
oh
hello
jerry
penny
greeted
him
breathlessly
guess
what
just
come
from
dorr
street
kano
curio
shop
and
i
had
the
most
amazing
adventure
i
can
imagine
grinned
jerry
if
you
breezed
through
the
place
the
way
you
do
this
building
you
must
have
left
it
in
ruins
just
for
that
i
wo
tell
you
a
thing
not
a
thing
retorted
penny
what
sort
of
a
mood
is
dad
in
today
well
i
heard
him
tell
dewitt
that
unless
the
news
output
improves
on
this
sheet
he
aims
to
fire
half
the
force
sounds
like
dad
on
one
of
his
bad
days
penny
sighed
maybe
i
should
skip
home
without
seeing
him
trouble
with
the
old
allowance
again
jerry
asked
sympathetically
you
do
know
the
half
of
it
i
submerged
so
deeply
in
debt
that
be
an
old
lady
before
i
get
out
unless
dad
comes
to
my
rescue
well
good
luck
chuckled
jerry
you
need
it
walking
through
the
newsroom
between
aisles
of
desks
where
busy
reporters
tapped
on
their
typewriters
penny
paused
before
a
door
marked
parker
listening
a
moment
and
hearing
no
voices
within
she
knocked
and
entered
her
father
a
lean
dignified
man
with
tired
lines
about
his
eyes
and
mouth
sat
working
at
his
desk
he
smiled
as
he
saw
his
daughter
and
waved
her
toward
a
chair
instead
penny
perched
herself
on
a
corner
of
the
desk
dad
i
have
a
splendid
surprise
for
you
she
began
brightly
i
just
accomplished
a
wonderful
stroke
of
business
never
mind
beating
about
the
bush
interrupted
parker
shoot
me
the
facts
straight
what
have
you
done
this
time
dad
your
tone
i
bought
back
my
old
car
leaping
lena
and
it
only
cost
me
a
trifling
sum
parker
chair
squeaked
as
he
whirled
around
you
done
it
a
long
story
dad
now
do
think
that
i
fail
to
appreciate
the
grand
new
car
you
gave
me
last
winter
i
love
it
but
between
lena
and
me
there
exists
a
deep
bond
of
affection
today
when
i
saw
her
on
jake
harriman
lot
looking
so
and
unhappy
why
a
little
voice
inside
me
whispered
why
do
you
buy
her
back
so
i
did
never
mind
the
sentimental
touches
when
i
gave
you
the
new
car
i
thought
we
were
well
rid
of
lena
how
much
did
you
pay
for
it
oh
lena
was
a
marvelous
bargain
five
dollars
cash
and
a
note
for
twenty
more
the
man
said
you
could
pay
for
it
at
your
convenience
very
considerate
of
him
parker
remarked
ironically
now
that
we
have
three
cars
and
a
double
garage
where
do
you
propose
to
keep
lena
oh
anywhere
in
the
back
yard
not
on
the
lawn
young
lady
and
what
do
you
plan
to
do
with
two
cars
the
maroon
one
for
style
and
lena
when
i
want
a
good
time
why
dad
she
bears
the
autographs
of
nearly
all
my
school
friends
i
should
keep
her
as
a
souvenir
if
for
no
other
reason
penny
it
high
time
you
learned
a
few
lessons
in
finance
parker
spoke
sternly
although
his
mouth
twitched
slightly
i
regret
that
i
can
not
assume
your
debts
but
dad
i
a
minor
under
legal
age
is
it
a
law
that
a
father
has
to
support
his
child
a
child
but
not
two
cars
if
you
decide
to
take
the
case
to
court
i
think
any
reasonable
judge
will
understand
my
viewpoint
i
repeat
the
debt
is
yours
not
mine
how
will
i
pay
asked
penny
gloomily
i
already
borrowed
on
my
allowance
for
a
month
ahead
i
know
said
her
father
however
with
your
ingenuity
i
am
sure
you
can
manage
penny
drew
a
deep
breath
argument
she
realized
would
be
utterly
useless
while
her
father
might
be
mildly
amused
by
her
predicament
he
never
would
change
his
decision
since
you
wo
pay
for
lena
i
suppose
it
useless
to
mention
kohl
fender
she
said
despairingly
does
he
have
one
please
do
try
to
be
funny
dad
this
is
tragic
while
i
was
towing
lena
the
rope
broke
and
smash
went
the
fender
of
kohl
slinky
black
limousine
interesting
i
had
to
promise
to
pay
for
it
to
keep
from
being
arrested
oh
yes
and
before
that
i
acquired
this
little
thing
penny
tossed
the
yellow
card
across
the
desk
a
parking
ticket
penny
how
many
times
parker
checked
himself
finishing
in
a
calm
voice
this
too
is
your
debt
it
may
cost
you
five
dollars
dad
you
know
i
ca
pay
think
how
your
reputation
will
be
tarnished
if
i
am
sent
to
jail
parker
smiled
and
reached
as
if
to
take
money
from
his
pocket
reconsidering
he
shook
his
head
i
know
the
warden
well
he
said
i
arrange
for
you
to
be
assigned
to
one
of
the
better
cells
is
there
nothing
which
will
move
you
to
generosity
pleaded
penny
nothing
retrieving
the
parking
ticket
penny
jammed
it
into
her
pocket
before
she
could
leave
there
came
a
rap
on
the
door
in
response
to
come
in
dewitt
the
city
editor
entered
sorry
to
bother
you
chief
what
wrong
now
dewitt
the
publisher
inquired
miss
hilderman
was
taken
sick
a
few
minutes
ago
we
had
to
send
her
home
in
a
cab
it
nothing
serious
i
hope
said
parker
with
concern
a
mild
heart
attack
she
be
out
a
week
if
not
longer
i
see
be
sure
to
have
the
treasurer
give
her
full
pay
you
have
someone
to
take
her
place
that
the
problem
moaned
dewitt
her
assistant
is
on
vacation
i
do
know
where
we
can
get
a
trained
society
editor
on
short
notice
well
do
the
best
you
can
dewitt
lingered
fingering
a
paper
weight
the
society
page
for
the
sunday
paper
is
only
half
finished
he
explained
deadline
in
less
than
an
hour
not
a
chance
we
can
pick
up
anyone
in
time
to
meet
it
penny
spoke
unexpectedly
dewitt
perhaps
i
can
help
you
i
a
whiz
when
it
comes
to
writing
society
remember
the
kippenberg
wedding
i
covered
do
i
dewitt
face
relaxed
into
a
broad
grin
that
was
a
real
say
maybe
you
could
take
over
miss
hilderman
job
until
we
can
replace
her
service
is
my
motto
penny
eyed
her
father
questioningly
it
might
save
the
from
going
to
press
minus
a
society
page
how
about
it
dad
it
certainly
would
solve
our
problem
contributed
dewitt
of
course
the
undertaking
might
be
too
great
a
one
for
your
daughter
he
winked
at
penny
she
have
no
difficulty
in
taking
over
said
parker
stiffly
none
whatsoever
then
i
start
her
in
at
once
dewitt
replied
come
with
me
miss
parker
at
the
door
penny
paused
and
discreetly
allowed
the
city
editor
to
get
beyond
hearing
then
turning
to
her
father
she
remarked
innocently
oh
by
the
way
we
overlooked
one
trifling
detail
the
salary
the
editor
made
a
grimace
i
might
have
expected
this
very
well
pay
you
the
same
as
i
do
miss
hilderman
a
week
why
that
would
just
take
care
of
my
debt
to
jake
harriman
protested
penny
i
simply
ca
do
high
pressure
work
without
high
pay
shall
we
make
it
fifty
a
week
so
you
holding
me
up
certainly
not
chuckled
penny
merely
using
my
ingenuity
am
i
hired
yes
you
win
answered
parker
grimly
but
see
to
it
that
you
turn
out
good
work
otherwise
you
soon
may
find
yourself
on
the
inactive
list
chapter
penny
followed
city
editor
dewitt
to
a
small
office
along
the
left
hand
wall
of
the
newsroom
miss
hilderman
desk
was
cluttered
with
sheets
of
copy
paper
which
bore
scribbled
notations
items
telephoned
to
the
but
not
yet
there
should
be
a
date
book
around
here
somewhere
dewitt
remarked
finally
he
found
it
in
one
of
the
desk
drawers
penny
drew
a
deep
breath
as
she
scanned
the
long
list
of
social
events
which
must
be
covered
for
the
sunday
page
do
the
best
you
can
dewitt
said
encouragingly
work
fast
but
be
careful
of
names
the
telephone
bell
rang
as
penny
reached
for
the
receiver
dewitt
retreated
to
his
own
domain
hello
miss
hilderman
a
feminine
voice
cooed
i
wish
to
report
a
meeting
please
miss
hilderman
is
here
this
afternoon
replied
penny
politely
i
will
take
the
item
gathering
up
paper
and
pencil
she
slid
into
the
revolving
chair
behind
the
telephone
poised
for
action
yes
she
urged
i
am
ready
there
was
a
lengthy
pause
and
then
the
woman
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
recited
as
if
she
were
reading
from
a
paper
meeting
of
the
mystical
society
of
celestial
thought
order
of
amar
will
be
held
tuesday
night
at
eight
in
the
temple
butternut
lane
the
public
is
cordially
invited
what
sort
of
society
is
the
order
of
amar
penny
inquired
curiously
taking
notes
i
never
heard
of
it
before
why
my
dear
the
society
is
very
well
known
the
woman
replied
we
hold
our
meetings
regularly
communing
with
the
spirits
i
do
hope
that
the
item
appears
in
print
so
often
miss
hilderman
has
been
careless
about
it
i
see
that
the
item
is
printed
under
club
notices
penny
promised
your
name
please
the
woman
had
hung
up
the
receiver
so
with
a
shrug
penny
typed
the
item
and
speared
it
on
a
wire
spindle
for
the
next
hour
she
was
kept
busy
with
other
telephone
calls
and
the
more
important
stories
which
had
to
be
rushed
through
copy
flowed
steadily
from
her
office
by
way
of
the
pneumatic
tube
to
the
composing
room
shortly
after
five
dewitt
dropped
in
for
a
moment
to
praise
her
for
her
speed
and
accuracy
you
doing
all
right
he
said
so
far
i
only
caught
you
in
one
mistake
mignonette
is
spelled
with
a
double
this
job
would
be
half
bad
if
only
brides
could
learn
to
carry
flowers
with
easy
names
laughed
penny
when
i
get
married
i
have
violets
and
sweet
peas
dewitt
reached
for
the
copy
on
the
spindle
what
this
he
asked
more
to
go
club
notices
the
editor
tore
the
sheet
from
the
wire
reading
it
as
he
walked
toward
the
door
abruptly
he
paused
and
turned
toward
her
miss
parker
this
ca
go
through
why
what
is
wrong
penny
asked
in
surprise
have
i
made
another
error
in
spelling
dewitt
tore
off
the
lead
item
and
tossed
it
on
her
desk
it
this
meeting
of
the
mystical
society
of
celestial
thought
the
never
runs
stuff
like
that
not
even
as
a
paid
advertisement
i
thought
it
was
a
regular
lodge
meeting
mr
dewitt
nothing
of
the
sort
merely
a
free
advertisement
for
a
group
of
mediums
and
charlatans
oh
i
did
know
murmured
penny
these
meetings
have
only
one
purpose
dewitt
resumed
to
lure
victims
who
later
may
be
fleeced
of
their
money
but
if
that
is
so
why
do
police
close
up
the
place
penny
demanded
why
does
the
run
an
exposé
story
because
evidence
is
easy
to
get
the
meetings
usually
are
well
within
the
law
whenever
a
police
detective
or
a
reporter
attends
the
services
are
decorous
but
they
provide
the
mediums
with
a
list
of
suckers
penny
would
have
asked
dewitt
for
additional
information
had
not
the
city
editor
walked
hurriedly
away
scrambling
the
item
into
a
ball
she
tossed
it
into
the
waste
paper
basket
then
upon
second
thought
she
retrieved
it
and
carefully
smoothed
the
paper
perhaps
i
drop
around
at
the
temple
sometime
just
to
see
what
it
is
like
she
decided
placing
the
item
in
her
pocket
it
would
be
interesting
to
learn
what
is
going
on
there
for
the
next
half
hour
penny
had
no
time
to
think
of
the
celestial
temple
however
at
twenty
minutes
before
six
when
her
father
came
into
the
office
she
was
well
ahead
of
her
work
hello
penny
he
greeted
her
how
do
you
like
your
new
job
fine
and
dandy
only
routine
items
rather
cramp
one
style
now
if
i
were
a
regular
reporter
instead
of
a
society
editor
i
know
several
stories
which
would
be
my
dish
for
instance
inquired
parker
smiling
first
there
an
oriental
shop
on
dorr
street
that
i
should
investigate
the
japanese
owner
acted
very
mysteriously
today
when
i
went
there
louise
and
i
saw
him
making
a
silk
ladder
and
he
refused
to
reveal
its
purpose
a
silk
ladder
repeated
parker
odd
perhaps
but
hardly
worthy
of
a
news
story
dad
i
only
wish
you
had
that
old
japanese
the
sinister
way
he
looked
at
me
oh
he
guilty
of
some
crime
i
feel
it
the
requires
facts
not
fancy
or
emotion
parker
rejoined
better
devote
your
talents
to
routine
society
items
if
you
expect
to
remain
on
my
payroll
penny
took
the
announcement
of
the
celestial
thought
meeting
from
her
pocket
and
offered
it
to
the
publisher
here
one
which
might
be
interesting
she
said
how
about
assigning
me
to
it
after
i
get
this
society
job
in
hand
parker
read
the
item
and
his
eyes
blazed
with
anger
do
you
know
what
this
means
penny
dewitt
told
me
a
little
about
the
celestial
temple
society
he
said
the
paper
never
ran
such
items
certainly
not
why
i
should
like
nothing
better
than
to
see
the
entire
outfit
driven
out
of
town
riverview
is
honeycombed
with
mediums
fortune
tellers
and
faith
healers
perhaps
they
mean
no
harm
dad
i
grant
there
may
be
a
small
number
of
persons
who
honestly
try
to
communicate
with
the
spirit
world
parker
replied
my
concern
is
not
with
them
but
with
a
group
of
professional
mediums
who
lately
have
invaded
the
city
charlatans
crooks
the
entire
lot
why
do
you
write
an
editorial
about
it
penny
suggested
an
editorial
i
am
seriously
tempted
to
start
a
vigorous
campaign
but
the
trouble
is
the
police
can
not
be
depended
upon
to
cooperate
actively
why
dad
because
experience
has
proven
that
such
campaigns
are
not
often
successful
evidence
is
hard
to
gain
if
one
place
is
closed
up
others
open
in
different
sections
of
the
city
the
mediums
and
seers
operate
from
dozens
of
private
homes
when
the
police
stage
raids
they
acquire
no
evidence
and
only
succeed
in
making
the
department
look
ridiculous
yet
the
mediums
continue
to
fleece
the
public
the
more
gullible
strata
of
it
until
recent
months
the
situation
here
has
been
no
worse
than
in
other
cities
of
comparable
size
lately
an
increasing
number
of
charlatans
has
moved
in
on
us
why
do
you
start
a
campaign
dad
penny
urged
you
would
be
doing
the
public
a
worthwhile
service
well
i
hesitate
to
start
something
which
i
may
be
unable
to
finish
at
least
the
public
deserves
to
be
warned
unfortunately
penny
many
persons
would
take
the
attitude
that
the
was
persecuting
sincere
spiritualists
a
campaign
must
be
based
on
absolute
evidence
ca
it
be
obtained
not
without
great
difficulty
these
mediums
are
a
clever
lot
penny
they
prey
upon
the
superstitions
of
their
intended
victims
i
wish
you
would
let
me
work
on
the
story
dad
no
penny
responded
her
father
you
attend
to
your
society
and
allow
dewitt
to
worry
about
the
celestial
temple
crowd
even
if
i
should
launch
a
campaign
i
could
allow
you
to
become
mixed
up
in
the
affair
the
telephone
bell
jingled
with
a
tired
sigh
penny
reached
for
the
receiver
society
desk
she
said
mechanically
i
am
trying
to
trace
parker
informed
the
office
exchange
operator
is
he
with
you
miss
parker
telephone
dad
said
penny
offering
him
the
receiver
parker
waited
a
moment
for
another
connection
to
be
made
then
penny
heard
him
say
oh
it
you
weems
what
that
repeat
it
please
from
her
father
tone
penny
felt
certain
that
something
had
gone
wrong
at
home
she
arose
waiting
anxiously
parker
clicked
the
receiver
several
times
apparently
weems
hung
up
he
commented
is
anything
the
matter
dad
i
do
know
parker
admitted
his
face
troubled
weems
seemed
very
excited
she
requested
me
to
come
home
as
soon
as
possible
then
the
connection
was
broken
why
do
you
try
to
reach
her
again
parker
placed
an
call
but
after
ten
minutes
the
operator
reported
that
she
was
unable
to
contact
the
housekeeper
weems
never
would
have
telephoned
if
something
unusual
happened
penny
declared
uneasily
perhaps
she
injured
herself
you
think
of
such
unpleasant
things
something
dreadful
must
have
happened
penny
insisted
otherwise
why
does
she
answer
we
only
wasting
time
in
idle
speculation
parker
said
crisply
get
your
things
penny
we
start
home
at
once
chapter
turn
of
penny
immediately
locked
her
desk
and
gathered
up
hat
and
gloves
she
was
hard
pressed
to
keep
pace
with
her
father
as
they
hastened
to
the
elevator
by
the
way
you
have
your
car
downstairs
the
publisher
inquired
absently
he
seldom
drove
his
own
automobile
to
the
office
what
a
memory
you
have
dad
chuckled
penny
yes
i
have
all
two
of
them
parked
in
the
loading
dock
for
convenience
penny
have
i
told
you
a
dozen
times
parker
began
only
to
check
himself
well
it
will
save
us
time
now
however
we
may
discuss
a
few
matters
when
we
get
home
the
elevator
shot
them
down
to
the
first
floor
leaping
lena
and
the
maroon
sedan
remained
in
the
loading
dock
with
a
string
of
paper
trucks
blocking
a
portion
of
the
street
hey
sister
a
trucker
called
angrily
to
penny
it
time
getting
these
cars
out
of
here
he
broke
off
as
he
recognized
parker
and
faded
behind
one
of
the
trucks
dad
do
you
mind
steering
lena
penny
asked
demurely
we
ca
leave
her
here
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
she
seems
to
be
blocking
traffic
yes
i
see
parker
responded
grimly
of
course
if
you
would
feel
more
dignified
driving
the
sedan
let
me
have
the
keys
the
publisher
interrupted
the
important
thing
is
to
get
home
without
delay
penny
became
sober
and
slid
into
her
place
at
the
wheel
of
leaping
lena
amid
the
smiles
of
the
truckers
parker
drove
the
two
cars
out
of
the
dock
once
underway
the
caravan
made
reckless
progress
through
traffic
more
than
once
penny
whispered
a
prayer
as
lena
swayed
around
a
corner
missing
other
cars
by
scant
inches
presently
the
two
automobiles
drew
up
before
a
pleasant
home
built
upon
a
high
terrace
overlooking
a
winding
river
penny
and
her
father
alighted
walking
hurriedly
toward
the
front
porch
the
door
stood
open
and
from
within
came
the
reassuring
howl
of
a
radio
turned
too
high
nothing
so
very
serious
can
have
happened
remarked
penny
otherwise
weems
would
have
that
thing
going
full
blast
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
the
housekeeper
herself
came
into
the
living
room
from
the
kitchen
her
plump
face
was
unusually
animated
i
hope
you
did
mind
because
i
telephoned
the
office
parker
she
began
apologetically
i
was
so
excited
i
just
did
it
before
i
stopped
to
think
penny
and
i
were
nearly
ready
to
start
home
in
any
case
weems
has
anything
gone
wrong
here
oh
no
parker
it
was
the
telegram
telegram
one
for
me
you
mean
no
my
own
the
housekeeper
drew
a
yellow
paper
from
the
pocket
of
her
apron
offering
it
to
the
publisher
my
cousin
david
died
out
in
montana
she
explained
the
funeral
was
last
saturday
that
too
bad
remarked
penny
sympathetically
and
then
she
added
only
you
do
look
particularly
sad
weems
how
much
did
he
leave
you
penny
you
say
such
shocking
things
i
never
met
cousin
david
but
once
in
my
life
he
was
a
kind
good
man
and
i
only
wish
i
had
written
to
him
more
often
i
never
dreamed
he
would
remember
me
in
his
will
then
he
did
leave
you
money
exclaimed
penny
triumphantly
how
much
does
the
telegram
say
dad
you
may
as
well
tell
her
parker
sighed
the
housekeeper
give
me
no
peace
until
she
learns
every
detail
this
message
which
is
from
a
montana
lawyer
mentions
six
thousand
dollars
returned
the
publisher
apparently
the
money
is
to
be
turned
over
without
legal
delay
why
weems
you
an
heiress
cried
penny
admiringly
i
ca
believe
it
true
murmured
weems
you
do
think
there
any
mistake
parker
it
would
be
too
cruel
if
someone
had
sent
the
message
as
a
joke
before
returning
the
telegram
to
the
housekeeper
parker
switched
off
the
radio
this
message
appears
to
be
authentic
he
declared
my
congratulations
upon
your
good
fortune
what
will
you
do
with
all
your
money
inquired
penny
oh
i
do
know
the
housekeeper
sank
into
a
chair
her
eyes
fastening
dreamily
on
a
far
wall
i
always
wanted
to
travel
penny
and
her
father
exchanged
a
quick
alarmed
glance
weems
had
been
in
charge
of
the
household
for
so
many
years
that
they
could
not
imagine
living
without
her
should
she
decide
to
leave
during
her
brief
infrequent
vacations
the
house
always
degenerated
into
a
disgrace
of
dust
and
misplaced
furniture
and
meals
were
never
served
at
regular
hours
the
oceans
are
very
unsafe
weems
discouraged
penny
wars
and
submarines
and
things
surely
you
would
dare
travel
now
oh
i
mean
in
the
united
states
replied
the
housekeeper
i
always
wanted
to
go
out
west
they
say
the
grand
canyon
is
so
pretty
it
takes
your
breath
away
weems
you
have
worked
for
us
long
and
faithfully
and
deserve
a
rest
said
parker
trying
to
speak
heartily
now
if
you
would
enjoy
a
trip
penny
and
i
will
get
along
somehow
for
two
or
three
weeks
oh
if
i
go
i
stay
the
entire
summer
the
housekeeper
hesitated
then
added
i
enjoyed
working
here
parker
but
doing
the
same
thing
year
after
year
gets
tiresome
often
i
said
to
myself
that
if
i
had
a
little
money
i
would
retire
and
take
life
easy
for
the
rest
of
my
days
why
weems
you
only
protested
penny
you
would
be
unhappy
if
you
did
have
any
work
to
do
at
least
i
would
mind
trying
it
such
a
change
as
you
contemplate
should
be
considered
carefully
contributed
parker
while
six
thousand
seems
a
large
sum
it
would
not
last
long
if
one
had
no
other
income
before
weems
could
reply
a
strong
odor
of
burning
food
permeated
the
room
the
roast
exclaimed
the
housekeeper
i
forgot
it
penny
rushed
ahead
of
her
to
the
kitchen
as
she
jerked
open
the
oven
door
out
poured
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
seizing
a
holder
she
rescued
the
meat
and
seeing
at
a
glance
that
it
was
burned
to
a
crisp
carried
the
pan
outdoors
what
will
the
neighbors
say
weems
moaned
i
never
did
a
thing
like
that
before
it
just
that
i
am
so
excited
i
ca
think
what
i
am
doing
do
you
mind
laughed
penny
i
get
dinner
tonight
you
entertain
dad
with
difficulty
she
persuaded
the
housekeeper
to
abandon
the
kitchen
left
to
herself
she
opened
a
can
of
cold
meat
a
can
of
corn
a
can
of
peaches
and
with
a
salad
already
prepared
speedily
announced
the
meal
parker
i
truly
am
ashamed
weems
began
now
do
apologize
for
my
cooking
broke
in
penny
quantity
before
quality
is
my
motto
anyway
if
you
are
leaving
dad
will
have
to
accustom
himself
to
it
i
hide
the
can
opener
said
parker
that
a
good
idea
dad
before
i
go
i
try
to
teach
penny
a
little
more
about
cooking
weems
said
uncomfortably
of
course
you
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
someone
efficient
to
take
my
place
no
one
can
take
your
place
declared
penny
if
you
leave
dad
and
i
will
go
to
wrack
and
ruin
you
are
a
pair
when
you
left
to
yourselves
weems
sighed
that
the
one
thing
which
makes
me
hesitate
penny
needs
someone
to
keep
her
in
check
an
inexperienced
person
would
be
putty
in
my
hands
declared
penny
you
may
as
well
decide
to
stay
mrs
weems
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
planned
on
this
trip
for
years
now
that
it
is
possible
i
feel
i
ca
give
it
up
penny
and
parker
regarded
each
other
across
the
table
and
immediately
changed
the
subject
not
until
that
moment
had
they
actually
believed
that
the
housekeeper
was
serious
about
leaving
riverview
somehow
they
had
never
contemplated
a
future
without
weems
i
happen
to
have
two
complimentary
tickets
to
a
show
at
the
rialto
parker
said
offhand
i
be
tied
up
with
a
meeting
tonight
but
you
folks
might
enjoy
going
shall
we
mrs
weems
inquired
penny
thank
you
responded
the
housekeeper
but
i
doubt
if
i
could
sit
still
tonight
i
thought
i
would
run
over
to
see
hodges
after
dinner
she
be
pleased
to
learn
about
my
inheritance
i
know
a
friend
of
yours
asked
parker
yes
penny
and
i
have
been
acquainted
with
her
for
years
she
lives
on
christopher
street
perhaps
this
is
none
of
my
affair
weems
however
my
advice
to
you
is
not
to
tell
many
persons
about
your
inheritance
oh
hodges
is
to
be
trusted
i
am
sure
of
it
weems
i
refer
to
strangers
i
be
careful
the
housekeeper
promised
no
one
ever
will
get
that
money
away
from
me
once
i
have
it
penny
helped
with
the
dishes
and
then
as
her
father
was
leaving
the
house
asked
him
if
she
might
have
the
two
theatre
tickets
since
weems
does
care
to
go
i
invite
louise
she
explained
parker
gave
her
the
tickets
making
certain
that
the
housekeeper
was
upstairs
he
spoke
in
a
low
tone
penny
weems
is
serious
about
leaving
us
you
must
try
to
dissuade
her
what
can
i
do
dad
well
you
usually
have
a
few
ideas
in
the
old
filing
cabinet
ca
you
think
of
something
i
do
my
best
penny
said
with
a
twinkle
we
ca
let
an
inheritance
take
weems
from
us
that
certain
after
her
father
had
gone
penny
telephoned
louise
agreeing
to
meet
her
chum
at
the
entrance
of
the
rialto
arriving
a
few
minutes
early
she
idly
watched
various
cars
unloading
their
passengers
at
the
theatre
presently
a
long
black
limousine
which
penny
recognized
drew
up
at
the
curb
the
chauffeur
opened
the
door
kohl
and
his
wife
stepped
to
the
pavement
observing
the
girl
they
paused
to
chat
with
her
i
see
you
have
the
new
fender
installed
on
your
car
kohl
penny
remarked
with
a
grin
may
i
ask
how
much
i
owe
the
garageman
the
sum
was
trifling
responded
the
banker
twelve
dollars
and
forty
cents
to
be
exact
i
may
as
well
take
care
of
it
myself
no
i
insist
said
penny
wincing
inwardly
you
see
i
am
one
of
the
highly
paid
executives
now
i
write
society
in
miss
absence
and
dad
gives
me
a
salary
oh
really
remarked
kohl
with
interest
we
are
giving
a
dinner
for
eight
tomorrow
night
you
might
like
to
mention
it
indeed
yes
said
penny
eagerly
obtaining
complete
details
she
jotted
notes
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
kohl
at
penny
request
was
able
to
recall
several
important
parties
which
had
been
held
that
week
providing
material
for
nearly
a
of
society
after
the
kohls
had
entered
the
theatre
penny
turned
to
glance
at
the
black
limousine
which
was
pulling
away
from
the
curb
a
short
distance
away
stood
a
young
man
who
likewise
appeared
to
be
watching
the
car
he
wore
a
gray
suit
and
a
gray
felt
hat
pulled
unnaturally
low
over
his
eyes
as
if
to
shield
his
face
as
penny
watched
the
young
man
jotted
something
down
on
a
piece
of
paper
his
gaze
remained
fixed
upon
the
kohl
limousine
which
was
moving
slowly
down
the
street
toward
a
parking
lot
why
that
odd
thought
penny
i
do
believe
he
noted
down
the
car
license
number
and
perhaps
for
no
good
purpose
chapter
man
in
deciding
that
the
matter
should
be
brought
to
kohl
attention
penny
looked
quickly
into
the
crowded
theatre
lobby
the
banker
and
his
wife
no
longer
were
to
be
seen
turning
once
more
the
girl
saw
that
the
young
man
in
gray
had
also
disappeared
now
where
did
he
go
thought
penny
he
must
have
slipped
into
the
alley
i
wish
i
knew
who
he
was
and
why
he
wrote
down
that
car
license
number
curious
to
learn
what
had
become
of
the
man
she
walked
to
the
entrance
of
the
alley
at
its
far
end
she
could
barely
distinguish
a
shadowy
figure
which
soon
merged
into
the
black
of
the
starless
night
penny
was
lost
in
thought
when
someone
touched
her
arm
whirling
she
found
herself
facing
louise
sidell
oh
hello
lou
she
laughed
you
startled
me
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
apologized
louise
i
missed
my
bus
may
i
ask
what
you
find
of
such
interest
in
this
alley
i
was
looking
for
a
man
he
disappeared
now
penny
told
louise
what
she
had
observed
mentioning
that
in
her
opinion
the
man
might
be
a
car
thief
i
heard
that
crooks
spot
cars
ahead
of
time
and
then
steal
them
she
declared
i
think
i
should
have
kohl
paged
in
the
theatre
and
tell
him
about
it
you
make
yourself
appear
ridiculous
if
you
do
louise
discouraged
her
the
man
may
not
have
taken
down
the
license
number
at
all
even
if
he
did
his
purpose
could
have
been
a
legitimate
one
then
why
did
he
slip
down
the
alley
it
merely
a
to
another
street
is
it
penny
your
imagination
simply
works
at
high
speed
hours
of
the
day
oh
all
right
said
penny
with
a
shrug
but
if
kohl
car
is
stolen
do
blame
me
it
wo
be
laughed
louise
linking
arms
with
her
chum
not
with
a
chauffeur
at
the
wheel
entering
the
theatre
the
girls
were
escorted
to
their
seats
only
a
few
minutes
before
the
lights
were
lowered
penny
glanced
over
the
audience
but
failed
to
see
either
kohl
or
his
wife
the
curtain
went
up
and
as
the
entertainment
began
she
dismissed
all
else
from
her
mind
the
show
ended
shortly
before
eleven
and
the
girls
mingled
with
the
crowd
which
filed
from
the
theatre
penny
watched
for
and
kohl
but
did
not
see
them
as
she
walked
with
louise
toward
the
bus
stop
she
spoke
of
her
new
duties
as
society

she
asked
abruptly

you
mind
going
home
alone

taking
yourself
to
the
office
if
you
do
mind

this
time
of
night

few
notes

should
type
unfinished
work

makes
me
nervous
you
nervous
louise
scoffed
i
bet

want
to
see
jerry
livingston
no
such
thing
denied
penny
indignantly
jerry
does
work
on
the
night
force
unless
he
assigned
to
extra
duty
well
you
have
something
besides
work
on
your
mind
come
along
with
me
suspicious
and
i
prove
it
no
thanks
declined
louise
it
home
and
bed
for
me
you
run
along
the
girls
separated
penny
walking
three
blocks
to
the
building
the
advertising
office
was
dark
but
lights
glowed
weirdly
from
the
composing
room
only
a
skeleton
night
staff
occupied
the
newsroom
without
attracting
attention
penny
entered
her
own
office
for
an
hour
she
worked
steadily
writing
copy
and
experimenting
with
various
types
of
to
be
used
on
monday
page
the
door
creaked
glancing
up
penny
momentarily
was
startled
to
see
a
large
grotesque
shadow
of
a
man
moving
across
the
glass
panel
however
before
she
actually
could
be
afraid
jerry
livingston
stepped
into
the
room
oh
it
you
she
laughed
in
relief
i
thought
it
was
against
your
principles
to
work
overtime
the
reporter
slumped
into
a
chair
and
picking
up
a
sheet
of
copy
paper
began
to
read
what
penny
had
composed
i
not
working
he
replied
absently
just
killing
time
with
a
yawn
he
tossed
the
paper
on
the
desk
again
is
my
stuff
that
bad
inquired
penny
not
bad
at
all
better
than
miss
hilderman
writes
but
society
always
gives
me
a
pain
not
worthy
of
your
talents
penny
i
wish
you
would
tell
dad
that
jerry
i
love
to
work
on
a
big
story
again
one
that
would
rock
riverview
on
its
foundation
i
could
bear
up
under
a
little
excitement
myself
penny
ever
since
you
broke
the
green
door
yarn
this
sheet
has
been
as
dead
as
an
egyptian
tomb
things
may
pick
up
soon
meaning
dad
is
thinking
rather
seriously
of
launching
a
drive
against
an
organized
group
of
mediums
so
i
hear
nodded
jerry
you
know
for
a
long
while
i
thought
that
a
clever
reporter
might
be
able
to
dig
up
some
evidence
at
the
celestial
temple
then
you
know
about
the
place
i
been
there
several
times
what
are
the
meetings
like
jerry
penny
asked
eagerly
similar
to
a
church
musical
service
at
least
everything
was
dignified
when
i
was
there
but
i
sure
had
a
feeling
that
the
lid
was
about
to
blow
off
perhaps
you
were
suspected
of
being
a
reporter
jerry
oh
undoubtedly
i
could
tell
that
by
the
way
folks
stared
at
me
the
only
person
who
would
have
a
chance
to
get
real
evidence
would
be
someone
unknown
as
a
reporter
i
wish
dad
would
let
me
try
it
i
do
said
jerry
flatly
the
celestial
temple
is
no
place
for
a
little
girl
like
you
penny
did
not
reply
as
she
lowered
her
typewriter
into
the
cavity
of
the
desk
she
was
thinking
however
that
if
louise
could
be
persuaded
to
accompany
her
she
would
investigate
the
celestial
temple
at
the
first
opportunity
i
take
you
home
jerry
offered
as
penny
reached
for
her
hat
the
night
was
a
warm
mellow
one
in
early
june
marred
only
by
dark
clouds
which
scudded
overhead
threatening
rain
deciding
to
walk
penny
and
jerry
crossed
the
park
to
oakdale
drive
where
many
of
most
expensive
homes
had
been
built
does
kohl
live
on
this
street
penny
presently
asked
her
escort
yes
he
answered
in
a
large
stone
apartment
building
i
point
it
out
when
we
get
there
they
walked
for
a
time
in
silence
then
penny
found
herself
telling
about
the
afternoon
meeting
with
kohl
which
had
led
her
to
kano
curio
shop
she
spoke
too
of
the
silken
ladder
which
had
so
aroused
her
speculation
jerry
listened
with
polite
interest
you
and
louise
should
have
chased
around
dorr
street
alone
he
said
severely
it
a
bad
district
oh
it
was
safe
enough
jerry
i
like
to
go
back
there
i
ca
help
being
curious
about
that
strange
ladder
which
the
old
japanese
man
was
sewing
i
doubt
if
there
a
story
connected
with
it
the
japanese
make
any
number
of
curious
articles
of
silk
you
know
but
a
ladder
jerry
what
purpose
could
it
serve
for
one
thing
it
would
be
more
convenient
to
carry
than
the
ordinary
type
one
could
stand
it
against
a
wall
or
use
it
in
the
ordinary
way
jerry
i
asked
the
japanese
about
it
but
he
refused
to
answer
he
may
not
have
understood
you
oh
he
understood
all
right
do
you
know
what
i
think
he
was
afraid
i
might
discover
something
which
would
involve
him
with
the
police
better
forget
the
kano
curio
shop
jerry
said
tolerantly
i
repeat
dorr
street
is
no
place
for
you
and
i
supposed
to
forget
the
celestial
temple
too
grumbled
penny
oh
i
see
you
grinned
behind
your
hand
well
livingston
let
me
tell
you
she
paused
and
jerry
hand
tightened
on
her
own
unmistakably
both
had
heard
a
muffled
scream
the
cry
seemed
to
have
come
from
one
of
several
large
brick
and
stone
buildings
only
a
short
distance
ahead
what
was
that
penny
asked
in
a
low
tone
someone
calling
for
help
it
sure
sounded
like
it
exclaimed
jerry
come
on
penny
let
find
out
what
going
on
here
chapter
apartment
together
penny
and
jerry
ran
down
the
street
their
eyes
raised
to
the
unevenly
lighted
windows
of
the
separate
apartment
houses
they
were
uncertain
as
to
the
building
from
which
the
cry
had
come
suddenly
the
front
door
of
the
corner
dwelling
swung
open
and
a
young
woman
in
a
maid
uniform
ran
toward
them
jerry
ever
alert
for
a
story
of
interest
to
the
neatly
blocked
the
sidewalk
of
necessity
the
girl
halted
get
a
policeman
quick
she
gasped
kohl
apartment
has
been
robbed
kohl
the
banker
demanded
penny
scarcely
believing
her
ears
yes
yes
the
maid
said
in
agitation
jewels
silverware
everything
has
been
taken
the
telephone
wire
was
cut
too
oh
tell
me
where
find
a
policeman
i
get
one
for
you
offered
jerry
the
information
that
it
was
kohl
house
which
had
been
burglarized
dumbfounded
penny
as
the
reporter
darted
away
to
summon
help
she
showered
questions
upon
the
distraught
maid
i
do
know
yet
how
much
has
been
taken
the
girl
told
her
excitedly
the
rooms
look
as
if
a
cyclone
had
swept
through
them
oh
what
will
the
kohls
say
when
they
learn
about
it
and
kohl
are
home
yet
no
they
went
to
the
theatre
they
must
have
stopped
at
a
restaurant
afterwards
when
they
hear
of
this
i
lose
my
job
perhaps
not
said
penny
kindly
surely
you
were
to
blame
for
the
burglary
they
think
so
the
maid
responded
gloomily
i
am
acquainted
with
and
kohl
perhaps
if
i
speak
a
good
word
for
you
it
may
help
i
doubt
it
the
girl
responded
i
was
supposed
to
have
stayed
at
the
apartment
the
entire
evening
and
you
did
no
i
went
to
a
picture
show
that
does
throw
a
different
light
on
the
matter
commented
penny
i
did
think
it
would
make
any
difference
i
intended
to
get
here
ahead
of
the
kohls
the
robbery
occurred
while
you
were
away
yes
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
door
i
knew
what
had
happened
oh
lose
my
job
all
right
unless
i
can
think
up
a
good
story
i
would
lie
if
i
were
you
advised
penny
the
police
are
certain
to
break
down
your
story
in
any
case
you
owe
it
to
yourself
and
your
employers
to
tell
the
truth
a
misty
rain
had
started
to
fall
the
maid
who
was
without
a
wrap
shivered
yet
made
no
move
to
the
building
overhead
all
along
the
dark
expanse
of
apartment
wall
lights
were
being
turned
on
i
am
afraid
your
scream
aroused
nearly
everyone
in
the
building
said
penny
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
return
to
the
kohl
apartment
and
not
answer
many
questions
until
the
police
arrive
will
you
stay
with
me
gladly
the
apartment
door
had
slammed
shut
and
locked
with
the
night
latch
fortunately
the
maid
had
a
key
with
her
so
it
was
not
necessary
to
ring
for
the
janitor
ignoring
the
persons
who
had
gathered
in
the
hall
they
took
an
automatic
lift
to
the
third
floor
letting
themselves
into
the
kohl
suite
this
is
the
way
i
found
it
said
the
maid
she
switched
on
a
light
revealing
a
living
room
entirely
bare
of
rugs
where
three
small
oriental
rugs
had
been
placed
only
rectangular
rims
of
dirt
remained
to
mark
their
outlines
beyond
in
the
dining
room
with
its
massive
carved
furniture
the
contents
of
a
buffet
had
been
emptied
on
the
floor
several
pieces
of
china
lay
in
fragments
a
corner
cupboard
had
been
stripped
save
for
a
vase
and
an
ebony
elephant
with
a
broken
tusk
the
wall
cabinet
was
filled
with
rare
antiques
disclosed
the
maid
kohl
has
collected
early
american
silver
for
many
years
some
of
the
pieces
she
considered
priceless
the
bedrooms
were
in
less
disorder
however
bureau
drawers
had
been
overturned
and
jewel
cases
looted
of
everything
save
the
most
trivial
articles
kohl
pearls
are
gone
and
her
diamond
bracelet
the
maid
informed
picking
up
the
empty
jewel
box
i
am
pretty
sure
she
wear
them
to
the
theatre
i
would
touch
anything
if
i
were
you
advised
penny
fingerprints
the
maid
dropped
the
case
oh
she
gasped
i
never
thought
of
that
do
you
think
the
police
will
blame
me
for
the
robbery
not
if
you
tell
them
the
truth
it
surely
will
be
unwise
to
try
to
hide
anything
i
wo
hold
anything
back
the
maid
promised
it
happened
just
like
i
said
after
and
kohl
left
i
went
to
a
picture
show
alone
with
my
girl
friend
after
the
show
we
had
a
soda
together
and
then
she
went
home
what
time
did
you
get
here
only
a
minute
or
two
before
i
called
for
help
i
tried
the
telephone
first
why
did
you
summon
the
janitor
i
never
thought
of
that
i
was
so
excited
i
ran
outside
hoping
to
find
a
policeman
penny
nodded
and
returning
to
the
living
room
satisfied
herself
that
the
telephone
wires
actually
had
been
cut
you
did
notice
anyone
in
the
halls
as
you
went
downstairs
no
one
old
veely
was
on
the
lower
floor
when
i
came
from
the
show
but
he
lived
here
for
seven
years
i
do
see
how
the
burglar
got
into
the
apartment
i
was
wondering
about
that
myself
you
quite
sure
you
locked
the
suite
door
oh
yes
i
know
i
did
the
maid
said
emphatically
and
it
possible
to
get
into
the
building
without
a
key
otherwise
the
janitor
must
be
called
penny
walked
thoughtfully
to
the
living
room
window
the
apartment
stood
fully
feet
from
a
neighboring
building
with
the
space
between
much
too
wide
to
be
spanned
below
the
alley
was
deserted
and
no
fire
escape
ascended
from
it
the
burglar
could
have
entered
that
way
declared
the
maid
he
must
have
had
his
own
key
before
penny
could
respond
a
sharp
knock
sounded
on
the
door
the
servant
girl
turned
to
open
it
however
instead
of
the
anticipated
police
the
apartment
janitor
george
bailey
peered
into
the
disordered
room
i
heard
someone
scream
a
minute
or
so
ago
he
said
some
of
the
tenants
thought
it
came
from
this
apartment
maybe
they
were
mistaken
there
no
mistake
spoke
penny
from
across
the
room
the
kohls
have
been
robbed
will
you
please
come
inside
and
close
the
door
robbed
you
do
say
the
janitor
stared
with
alarmed
interest
when
did
it
happen
penny
allowed
the
maid
to
tell
what
had
occurred
adding
no
information
of
her
own
when
there
came
a
lull
in
the
excited
flow
of
words
she
said
quietly
bailey
do
you
mind
answering
a
few
questions
why
should
i
the
janitor
countered
i
tell
you
right
now
i
know
nothing
about
this
i
attended
strictly
to
my
duties
it
not
my
lookout
if
tenants
leave
their
suite
doors
unlocked
no
one
is
blaming
you
penny
assured
him
i
merely
thought
you
might
contribute
to
a
solution
of
the
burglary
i
do
know
a
thing
about
it
you
did
let
anyone
into
the
apartment
building
tonight
not
a
soul
i
locked
the
service
door
at
six
too
now
let
me
ask
this
who
are
you
and
how
did
you
get
in
here
that
fair
enough
smiled
penny
she
told
her
name
explained
that
she
was
an
acquaintance
of
the
kohls
and
had
been
summoned
by
the
maid
please
do
think
that
i
am
trying
to
play
detective
she
added
i
ask
these
questions
in
the
hope
of
gaining
information
for
my
paper
the
well
it
looks
to
me
as
if
it
was
an
inside
job
the
janitor
replied
mollified
come
to
think
of
it
though
i
seen
a
fellow
hanging
around
the
building
you
mean
tonight
no
several
days
ago
he
stayed
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
kept
watching
the
doorway
what
did
he
look
like
mr
bailey
oh
i
do
remember
he
was
just
an
average
young
man
in
a
gray
overcoat
and
hat
gray
repeated
penny
alertly
it
may
have
been
light
blue
i
did
pay
much
attention
at
the
time
i
sized
up
the
fellow
as
a
detective
penny
had
no
opportunity
to
ask
additional
questions
for
just
then
voices
were
heard
in
the
hallway
as
she
opened
the
door
jerry
livingston
followed
by
a
policeman
came
toward
her
learn
anything
the
reporter
asked
softly
in
her
ear
a
little
answered
penny
let
see
how
much
the
officer
turns
up
before
i
go
into
my
song
and
dance
making
a
routine
inspection
of
the
rooms
the
police
questioned
both
the
maid
and
the
janitor
from
an
elderly
lady
who
occupied
the
adjoining
suite
he
gleaned
information
that
the
kohls
telephone
had
rung
steadily
for
fifteen
minutes
during
the
early
evening
hours
what
time
was
that
interposed
penny
the
policeman
gazed
at
her
with
sharp
disapproval
please
he
requested
with
exaggerated
politeness
sorry
apologized
penny
fading
into
the
background
it
rang
about
eight
the
old
lady
revealed
the
information
is
not
significant
said
the
officer
glancing
again
at
penny
she
started
to
speak
then
bit
her
lip
remaining
silent
well
sister
what
on
your
mind
he
demanded
abruptly
excuse
me
officer
but
i
think
the
information
does
have
importance
could
it
mean
that
the
crooks
whoever
they
were
telephoned
the
apartment
to
make
certain
it
was
deserted
before
breaking
in
possibly
conceded
the
policeman
his
frown
discouraged
her
any
other
theories
no
said
penny
shortly
the
policeman
began
to
herd
the
tenants
into
the
hall
for
a
moment
he
paid
no
attention
to
penny
and
jerry
who
with
the
maid
were
permitted
to
remain
never
try
to
show
up
a
policeman
even
if
he
is
a
stuffed
shirt
remarked
the
reporter
softly
it
gets
you
nowhere
the
door
closed
and
the
officer
faced
the
pair
now
young
lady
he
said
quite
pleasantly
what
do
you
know
about
this
burglary
i
be
very
glad
to
listen
i
do
really
know
a
thing
admitted
penny
but
here
a
little
clue
which
you
may
be
able
to
interpret
i
ca
leading
the
policeman
to
the
window
she
started
to
raise
the
sash
the
officer
stopped
her
performing
the
act
himself
his
hand
protected
by
a
handkerchief
there
is
your
clue
said
penny
she
indicated
two
freshly
made
gashes
on
the
window
ledge
separated
by
possibly
a
foot
of
space
they
clearly
had
been
made
by
a
hook
or
sharp
instrument
which
had
dug
deeply
into
the
wood
chapter
of
the
iron
what
do
you
think
of
it
penny
asked
as
the
officer
studied
the
marks
in
silence
i
say
they
were
made
by
something
which
hooked
over
the
ledge
the
policeman
replied
possibly
a
ladder
with
curving
irons
jerry
gazed
down
over
the
window
ledge
into
the
dark
alley
no
ordinary
ladder
could
reach
this
high
he
commented
raising
an
extension
would
be
quite
a
problem
too
the
kohl
maid
timidly
approached
the
window
gazing
at
the
two
deep
gashes
with
interest
asked
by
the
policeman
if
she
ever
had
noticed
them
before
she
shook
her
head
oh
no
sir
they
must
have
been
made
tonight
i
know
they
were
there
this
afternoon
when
i
dusted
the
window
sills
incredible
as
it
seems
the
thief
came
through
this
window
decided
the
policeman
how
he
did
it
is
for
the
detectives
at
central
station
to
figure
out
explaining
that
the
rooms
must
not
be
disturbed
until
identification
bureau
men
had
made
complete
fingerprint
records
the
officer
locked
penny
jerry
and
the
maid
outside
the
suite
he
then
went
to
a
nearby
apartment
to
telephone
his
report
maybe
this
is
an
ordinary
burglary
but
it
does
look
that
way
to
me
remarked
jerry
as
he
and
penny
went
down
the
stairway
in
any
case
the
story
should
be
front
page
copy
anything
the
kohls
do
is
news
in
riverview
how
high
would
you
estimate
the
loss
oh
i
could
guess
jerry
thousands
of
dollars
passing
groups
of
tenants
who
cluttered
the
hallway
excitedly
discussing
the
burglary
they
evaded
questioners
and
reached
the
street
jerry
said
penny
suddenly
i
did
mention
this
to
the
policeman
because
he
seemed
to
resent
my
opinions
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
may
have
seen
the
man
who
robbed
the
kohls
or
at
least
had
something
to
do
with
it
how
could
you
have
seen
him
penny
we
were
together
when
the
kohl
maid
yelled
for
help
earlier
than
that
it
was
while
i
was
at
the
theatre
half
expecting
that
jerry
would
laugh
penny
told
how
she
had
observed
the
man
in
gray
note
down
the
license
number
of
the
kohl
limousine
it
came
to
me
like
a
flash
that
fellow
may
have
telephoned
the
kohl
apartment
after
seeing
the
car
at
the
theatre
making
sure
no
one
was
at
home
he
then
looted
the
place
at
his
leisure
wait
a
minute
interrupted
jerry
the
motor
vehicle
department
closes
at
six
how
could
your
man
have
obtained
kohl
name
and
address
from
the
license
number
i
never
thought
about
the
department
being
closed
confessed
penny
how
you
do
love
to
shoot
shrapnel
into
my
little
ideas
at
least
you
have
original
theories
which
is
more
than
i
do
comforted
jerry
before
we
leave
shall
we
take
a
look
at
the
alley
penny
brightened
instantly
and
accompanied
the
reporter
to
the
rear
of
the
building
the
alley
was
deserted
without
a
light
they
were
unable
to
examine
the
ground
beneath
the
kohl
apartment
window
suddenly
both
straightened
as
they
heard
a
sound
behind
them
the
brilliant
beam
of
a
flashlight
focused
on
their
faces
blinding
them
oh
it
you
again
said
a
gruff
voice
the
beam
was
lowered
and
behind
it
they
saw
the
policeman
you
young
cubs
are
a
pest
he
said
irritably
ignoring
them
he
moved
his
light
over
the
ground
there
were
no
footprints
or
other
marks
visible
beneath
the
window
if
a
ladder
had
stood
here
it
would
show
remarked
jerry
the
thief
must
have
used
some
other
means
of
getting
into
the
building
while
the
policeman
was
inspecting
the
ground
the
janitor
stepped
from
a
rear
basement
door
joining
the
group
officer
i
have
some
more
information
for
you
he
volunteered
what
is
it
i
was
talking
with
my
wife
she
says
that
about
two
hours
ago
she
noticed
a
man
walking
through
the
alley
he
carried
a
suitcase
and
kept
looking
at
the
upstairs
windows
no
ladder
only
a
suitcase
i
have
the
detectives
talk
with
your
wife
the
policeman
promised
they
be
here
any
minute
now
penny
and
jerry
lingered
until
the
two
men
arrived
bringing
a
photographer
with
them
no
new
evidence
being
made
available
it
seemed
a
waste
of
time
to
remain
longer
do
bother
to
take
me
home
penny
insisted
dash
straight
to
the
office
and
write
your
story
the
other
papers
wo
have
a
word
about
the
robbery
until
the
police
report
is
made
i
do
like
to
abandon
you
do
be
silly
jerry
it
only
a
few
blocks
farther
thus
urged
the
reporter
bade
penny
as
she
hastened
on
alone
it
began
to
rain
and
the
air
turned
colder
to
save
her
clothing
she
ran
the
last
block
reaching
the
porch
quite
breathless
the
house
was
dark
the
front
door
locked
penny
let
herself
in
with
a
key
switched
on
the
lights
and
after
getting
a
snack
from
the
refrigerator
started
upstairs
from
her
father
room
issued
loud
snores
however
weems
door
stood
open
and
as
penny
glanced
in
she
was
surprised
to
see
that
the
bed
had
not
been
disturbed
weems
must
still
be
at
the
hodges
she
thought
perhaps
i
should
go
after
her
she
have
a
long
walk
in
this
rain
penny
went
to
a
window
and
looked
out
the
downpour
showed
no
sighs
of
slackening
with
a
sigh
she
found
her
raincoat
and
started
for
the
garage
during
her
absence
parker
had
towed
leaping
lena
to
a
vacant
lot
adjoining
the
property
the
maroon
car
awaited
her
beneath
shelter
and
she
drove
it
through
dark
streets
to
the
hodges
modest
home
lights
glowed
cheerily
from
the
lower
floor
windows
in
response
to
penny
knock
a
bent
old
man
his
hands
gnarled
by
hard
labor
opened
the
door
is
it
penelope
he
asked
squinting
at
her
through
the
rain
come

penny
called
the
housekeeper
goodness
what
time
is
it
anyway
nearly
midnight
penny
shook
water
from
her
coat
and
stepped
into
the
spic
and
span
living
room
an
unshaded
electric
light
disclosed
a
rug
too
bright
wallpaper
too
glaring
furniture
stiff
and
old
fashioned
yet
one
felt
at
once
welcome
for
the
seamstress
and
her
husband
were
simple
friendly
people
have
a
chair
penelope
invited
hodges
she
was
short
like
her
husband
with
graying
hair
and
an
untroubled
countenance

replied
penny
i
came
to
drive
weems
home
i
had
no
idea

so
late
the
housekeeper
said

to
her
feet
hodges

evening

penny
gasped

i
find

maybe
she
aims
to
catch
a
husband
while
she
galavantin
around
out
there
in
californy
contributed
hodges
with
a
sly
wink
the
very
idea
laughed
weems
yet
with
no
displeasure
penny
sagged
into
the
nearest
rocking
chair
the
conversation
was
paced
too
fast
for
her
evening
gowns
husbands
california
she
murmured
weakly
wait
until
dad
hears
about
this
hodges
was
only
joking
declared
weems
reaching
for
her
hat
i
would
marry
the
best
man
on
earth
but
i
definitely
am
going
west
this
summer

said
the
seamstress
her
eyes
shining
pa
and
i
want
to
go
out
there
and
buy
a
little
orange
grove
someday
but
with
taxes
what
they
are
we
ca
seem
to
save
a
penny
weems
squeezed
her
friend
hand
i
wish
i
could
take
you
along
jenny
she
said
all
these
years
sewed
your
poor
fingers
almost
to
the
bone
you
deserve
an
easier
life
oh
pa
and
i
do

the
seamstress
answered
brightly
and
things
are
going
to
look
up
sure
they
are
agreed
hodges
i
get
a
job
any
day
now
penny
who
was
watching
the
seamstress
face
was
amazed
to
see
it
suddenly
transformed
losing
her
usual
calm
hodges
exclaimed
pa
it
just
this
minute
came
to
me
maud
getting
her
inheritance
is
another
psychic
sign
penny
rocked
violently
and
even
weems
looked
startled
i
do
know
what
you
mean
jenny
she
said
we
said
we
would
tell
anybody
ma
protested
hodges
mildly
weems
is
my
best
friend
and
penelope
wo
tell
will
you
penelope
not
what
i
do
know
replied
penny
in
bewilderment
how
can
weems
inheritance
have
anything
to
do
with
a
psychic
sign
you
may
as
well
tell
grinned
hodges
if
you
keep
the
news
much
longer
you
bust
the
strangest
thing
happened
three
nights
ago
hodges
began
her
voice
quivering
with
excitement
but
wait
first
i
show
you
the
letter
chapter
as
penny
and
weems
waited
the
seamstress
went
to
another
room
returning
with
a
stamped
slit
envelope
notice
the
postmark
she
requested
thrusting
the
letter
into
hand
it
was
mailed
from
new
york
the
girl
observed
i
mean
the
hour
at
which
the
envelope
was
stamped
by
the
postmaster
i
make
it
june
fifteenth
penny
read
aloud
does
the
time
and
date
have
special
significance
indeed
it
does
the
seamstress
replied
impressively
you
tell
them
it
happened
three
nights
ago
began
hodges
ma
worked
late
stitchin
up
some
playsuits
for
hudson
little
girl
afterwards
we
had
bread
and
milk
like
we
always
do
and
then
we
went
to
bed
at
the
time
i
said
to
pa
that
something
queer
was
going
to
happen
broke
in
the
seamstress
i
could
feel
it
in
my
bones
it
was
as
if
something
was
hovering
over
us
a
feeling
of
impending
trouble
questioned
penny
nothing
like
that
said
hodges
no
it
was
as
if
one
almost
could
feel
a
foreign
presence
in
the
room
hodges
declared
lowering
her
voice
a
supernatural
being
surely
you
do
believe
in
ghosts
penny
began
but
the
seamstress
did
not
hear
unheeding
she
resumed
pa
rubbed
my
back
to
ease
the
pain
i
get
from
working
too
long
at
the
machine
then
we
went
to
bed
neither
of
us
had
gone
to
sleep
when
suddenly
we
heard
it
six
sharp
raps
on
the
outside
bedroom
wall
supplied
hodges
it
was
like
this
he
demonstrated
on
the
table
we
both
heard
it
added
hodges
it
scared
me
nearly
out
of
my
wits
possibly
it
was
someone
at
the
door
suggested
penny
no
it
was
that
pa
got
up
and
went
to
see
could
it
have
been
a
tree
bough
brushing
against
the
wall
it
was
that
said
hodges
the
maple
is
too
far
off
to
strike
our
bedroom
there
only
one
explanation
declared
the
seamstress
with
conviction
it
was
a
psychic
sign
the
first
i
do
believe
in
such
things
myself
announced
penny
surely
there
must
be
another
explanation
that
what
i
told
jenny
nodded
hodges
but
since
the
letter
came
doggoned
if
i
do
think
maybe
she
right
what
has
the
letter
to
do
with
it
inquired
weems
the
seamstress
pointed
to
the
postmark
on
the
envelope
the
hour
at
which
we
heard
the
strange
tappings
was
pa
looked
at
the
clock
and
it
was
three
days
ago
june
fifteenth
corresponding
to
the
marking
on
this
envelope
commented
penny
that
is
a
coincidence
hodges
shook
her
head
impatiently
you
surely
do
think
it
just
happened
by
she
asked
it
must
have
been
intended
as
a
sign
an
omen
what
did
the
letter
say
penny
inquired
without
answering
question
she
knew
that
her
true
opinion
would
not
please
the
woman
it
was
rightly
a
letter
the
seamstress
returned
the
envelope
contained
six
silver
dollars
fitted
into
a
stiff
piece
of
cardboard
we
figured
it
was
another
sign
contributed
hodges
six
raps
on
the
wall
six
dollars
i
wish
some
ghost
would
come
and
pound
all
night
long
on
my
bedroom
door
remarked
penny
lightly
penelope
you
should
speak
so
disrespectfully
weems
reproved
in
a
mild
voice
excuse
me
i
did
mean
to
said
penny
composing
her
face
what
else
has
happened
of
a
supernatural
nature
why
nothing
yet
hodges
admitted
but
pa
and
i
have
had
a
feeling
as
if
something
important
were
about
to
take
place
and
now
maud
inherits
six
thousand
dollars
there
was
nothing
psychic
about
that
said
weems
cousin
david
had
no
close
relatives
so
he
left
the
money
to
me
the
seamstress
shook
her
head
and
an
ethereal
light
shone
in
her
eyes
night
before
last
when
i
went
to
bed
i
was
thinking
that
i
wished
with
all
my
heart
something
nice
would
happen
to
you
maud
now
it
come
to
pass
even
weems
was
somewhat
startled
by
the
seamstress
calm
assumption
that
her
thoughts
had
been
responsible
for
the
inheritance
do
you
see
hodges
resumed
patiently
it
must
mean
that
i
have
great
psychic
powers
i
confess
i
am
rather
frightened
penny
arose
and
began
to
button
her
raincoat
excuse
me
for
saying
it
she
remarked
but
if
i
were
you
hodges
i
spend
the
six
dollars
and
forget
the
entire
affair
someone
must
have
played
a
joke
on
you
a
joke
the
seamstress
was
offended
people
do
give
away
money
as
a
joke
no
these
days
they
squeeze
the
eagles
until
they
holler
chuckled
hodges
the
letter
was
postmarked
new
york
city
went
on
his
wife
we
know
a
soul
there
oh
no
one
ever
can
make
me
believe
that
it
was
done
as
a
joke
the
letter
was
mailed
at
exactly
the
hour
we
heard
the
six
raps
and
there
was
a
sign
of
anyone
near
the
house
added
hodges
well
at
least
you
six
dollars
ahead
said
penny
shall
we
go
weems
it
after
midnight
the
seamstress
walked
to
the
door
with
the
callers
i
get
busy
tomorrow
on
those
new
dresses
she
promised
weems
drop
in
again
whenever
you
can
and
you
too
penelope
driving
home
through
the
rain
penny
stole
a
quick
glance
at
the
housekeeper
who
seemed
unusually
quiet
do
you
suppose
jenny
could
be
right
weems
presently
ventured
i
mean
about
cousin
david
and
the
inheritance
of
course
not
laughed
penny
why
your
cousin
died
a
long
while
before
hodges
discovered
that
she
was
psychic
it
all
the
bunk
i
wish
i
really
knew
why
mrs
weems
penny
prepared
to
launch
into
a
violent
argument
i
never
heard
of
such
nonsense
how
could
hodges
have
psychic
powers
everyone
realizes
that
communication
with
the
spirit
world
is
impossible
you
are
entitled
to
your
opinion
penny
but
others
may
differ
with
you
who
can
know
about
the
life
beyond
is
it
in
the
realm
of
possibility
that
hodges
may
have
had
a
message
from
cousin
david
she
did
speak
of
it
not
in
words
penny
but
those
strange
rappings
the
arrival
of
the
letter
it
was
all
very
strange
and
unexplainable
i
admit
it
was
queer
weems
however
i
never
agree
that
there
anything
supernatural
connected
with
it
you
close
your
mind
to
things
you
do
not
wish
to
believe
the
housekeeper
reproved
what
can
any
of
us
know
of
the
spirit
world
penny
gazed
at
weems
in
alarm
she
realized
that
the
story
had
deeply
impressed
her
i
stake
my
knowledge
against
hodges
any
old
day
she
declared
lightly
i
met
one
osandra
remember
him
why
remind
me
of
that
man
penny
asked
the
housekeeper
wearily
because
you
once
paid
him
good
money
for
the
privilege
of
attending
his
séances
you
were
convinced
he
was
in
communication
with
the
world
beyond
he
proved
to
be
an
outrageous
fraud
i
was
taken
in
by
him
as
were
many
other
persons
weems
acknowledged
hodges
case
is
different
we
have
been
friends
for
ten
years
she
would
not
misrepresent
the
facts
no
hodges
is
honest
i
believe
that
the
money
was
sent
to
her
but
not
by
a
ghost
let
not
discuss
it
said
weems
with
finality
i
never
did
enjoy
an
argument
penny
lapsed
into
silence
and
a
moment
later
the
car
swung
into
the
parker
driveway
the
housekeeper
hurried
into
the
house
leaving
the
girl
to
close
the
garage
doors
penny
snapped
the
padlock
shut
unmindful
of
the
rain
she
stood
for
a
moment
staring
into
the
night
nothing
had
gone
exactly
right
that
day
and
her
disagreement
with
weems
minor
though
it
was
bothered
her
there
more
to
this
psychic
business
than
appears
on
the
surface
she
thought
grimly
a
great
deal
more
maybe
i
am
stubborn
and
opinionated
but
i
know
one
thing
no
trickster
is
going
to
take
advantage
of
the
hodges
or
of
weems
either
not
if
i
can
prevent
it
chapter
weems
the
clock
chimed
the
next
morning
as
penny
came
downstairs
she
dropped
a
kiss
on
her
father
forehead
and
slid
into
a
chair
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
breakfast
table
good
morning
daddykins
she
greeted
him
cheerfully
any
news
in
the
old
scandal
sheet
parker
lowered
the
newspaper
please
do
call
me
daddykins
he
requested
you
know
i
hate
it
here
something
which
may
interest
you
your
friends
the
kohls
were
robbed
last
night
you
eight
hours
late
grinned
penny
reaching
for
the
front
page
i
was
there
i
suppose
you
lifted
the
pearls
and
the
diamond
bracelet
on
your
way
to
the
theatre
no
said
penny
rapidly
scanning
the
story
which
jerry
had
written
but
i
think
i
may
have
seen
the
man
who
did
do
it
she
then
told
her
father
of
having
observed
a
stranger
note
the
license
number
of
the
kohl
car
and
mentioned
the
events
which
had
followed
you
may
have
been
mistaken
about
what
the
man
wrote
down
commented
her
father
that
possible
but
he
was
staring
straight
at
the
car
i
doubt
if
the
incident
had
any
connection
with
the
burglary
penny
with
the
motor
vehicle
department
closed
he
would
have
had
no
means
of
quickly
learning
who
the
kohls
were
or
where
they
lived
could
he
have
recognized
them
in
that
case
he
would
have
no
need
for
the
license
number
you
see
the
man
note
down
the
plates
of
other
cars
no
but
he
may
have
done
it
before
i
noticed
him
standing
by
the
theatre
turning
idly
through
the
morning
paper
penny
attention
was
drawn
to
another
news
story
reading
it
rapidly
she
thrust
the
page
into
her
father
hand
dad
look
at
this
there
were
two
other
burglaries
last
night
apartment
houses
on
drexel
boulevard
and
fenmore
street
were
entered
interesting
the
kohls
occupy
an
apartment
also
that
rather
suggests
that
the
same
thief
ransacked
the
three
places
and
it
says
here
that
the
families
were
away
for
the
evening
penny
resumed
with
increasing
excitement
i
bet
a
cent
they
were
at
the
theatre
oh
dad
that
man
in
gray
must
have
been
the
one
who
did
it
if
all
the
persons
you
suspect
of
crime
were
arrested
our
jails
could
hold
them
remarked
parker
calmly
eat
your
breakfast
penny
before
it
gets
cold
weems
entered
through
the
kitchen
door
bearing
reenforcements
of
hot
waffles
and
crisp
bacon
her
appearance
reminded
penny
to
launch
into
a
highly
entertaining
account
of
all
that
had
transpired
at
the
the
previous
night
penny
protested
the
housekeeper
you
promised
hodges
to
say
nothing
about
the
letter
oh
no
i
did
promise
corrected
penny
i
was
careful
to
say
that
i
could
tell
what
i
did
know
years
ago
dad
taught
me
that
a
good
reporter
never
agrees
to
accept
a
confidence
is
that
so
dad
a
wise
reporter
never
ties
his
own
hands
replied
parker
if
he
promises
and
then
obtains
the
same
story
from
another
source
morally
bound
not
to
use
it
his
paper
may
be
scooped
by
the
opposition
you
two
are
a
pair
sighed
weems
scoops
and
front
page
stories
are
all
either
of
you
think
about
i
declare
it
distresses
me
to
realize
how
penny
may
be
trained
after
i
leave
the
way
to
solve
that
problem
is
not
to
leave
said
penny
you
know
we
ca
get
along
without
you
weems
shook
her
head
it
cuts
me
almost
in
two
to
leave
she
declared
sadly
but
my
made
up
hodges
says
i
am
doing
the
right
thing
and
i
suppose
a
ghost
advised
her
muttered
penny
parker
glanced
sternly
at
his
daughter
and
she
subsided
into
silence
but
not
for
long
soon
she
was
trying
to
reopen
the
subject
of
the
mysterious
letter
received
by
the
hodges
for
a
reason
she
could
not
understand
her
father
was
loath
to
discuss
it
come
penny
he
said
if
we
having
that
game
of
tennis
this
morning
it
time
we
start
en
route
to
the
park
the
publisher
explained
why
he
had
not
chosen
to
express
an
opinion
in
the
housekeeper
presence
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
hodges
has
no
psychic
powers
penny
she
been
the
victim
of
a
hoax
however
weems
is
intensely
loyal
to
her
friend
and
any
disparaging
remarks
made
by
us
will
only
serve
to
antagonize
her
i
try
to
be
more
careful
dad
but
it
so
silly
monday
morning
found
penny
busy
once
more
with
her
duties
at
the
society
desk
no
new
information
had
developed
regarding
the
kohl
burglary
and
she
did
not
have
time
to
accompany
weems
who
went
frequently
to
the
hodges
cottage
secretly
penny
held
an
opinion
that
the
housekeeper
inheritance
might
be
the
work
of
a
prankster
therefore
upon
returning
from
the
office
one
afternoon
and
learning
that
the
money
actually
had
been
delivered
she
was
very
glad
she
had
kept
her
thoughts
to
herself
the
lawyer
came
this
morning
and
had
me
sign
a
paper
weems
revealed
to
the
parkers
then
he
turned
the
money
over
to
me
six
thousand
dollars
i
hope
the
cheque
is
good
remarked
penny
it
was
i
had
the
lawyer
accompany
me
to
the
bank
they
gave
me
the
money
without
asking
a
single
question
i
have
it
here
you
have
six
thousand
dollars
cash
in
the
house
yes
i
had
the
cashier
give
it
to
me
in
hundred
dollar
bills
do
you
consider
it
safe
to
keep
such
a
large
sum
parker
inquired
mildly
i
should
advise
returning
it
to
the
bank
or
better
still
why
not
invest
it
in
sound
securities
weems
shook
her
head
it
gives
me
a
nice
rich
feeling
to
have
the
cash
i
hidden
it
in
a
good
place
where
demanded
penny
i
wo
tell
laughed
weems
again
later
in
the
evening
parker
tried
without
success
to
convince
the
housekeeper
that
she
should
return
the
money
to
a
bank
never
one
to
force
his
opinions
upon
another
he
then
dropped
the
subject
when
will
you
be
leaving
us
mrs
weems
he
inquired
whenever
you
can
spare
me
now
that
i
have
the
money
i
should
like
to
leave
within
ten
days
or
two
weeks
since
we
ca
persuade
you
to
remain
i
try
to
find
someone
to
take
your
place
parker
promised
both
he
and
penny
were
gloomy
at
the
prospect
of
replacing
the
housekeeper
not
only
would
they
miss
weems
but
they
honestly
believed
that
she
would
never
be
happy
without
two
incorrigibles
and
a
home
to
manage
dad
penny
ventured
when
they
were
alone
just
supposing
that
weems
money
should
mysteriously
disappear
do
allow
your
mind
to
dwell
on
that
idea
cut
in
her
father
sternly
we
play
fair
oh
i
would
do
it
said
penny
hastily
i
was
only
joking
but
if
something
happen
to
the
money
it
would
solve
all
our
problems
weems
has
earned
her
vacation
even
though
it
will
be
hard
to
lose
her
we
must
stand
in
her
way
i
guess
you
right
sighed
penny
the
following
day
miss
hilderman
resumed
her
duties
at
the
and
penny
once
more
found
herself
a
person
of
leisure
to
her
annoyance
weems
insisted
that
she
spend
many
hours
in
the
kitchen
learning
how
to
bake
pies
and
cakes
a
particularly
distasteful
lesson
came
to
an
end
only
when
penny
with
brilliant
inspiration
remembered
that
the
housekeeper
had
an
appointment
with
the
seamstress
dear
me
i
had
forgotten
it
exclaimed
weems
yes
i
must
try
on
my
new
dresses
i
drive
you
over
offered
penny
not
in
recent
days
had
the
girl
called
upon
the
hodges
as
she
and
weems
alighted
from
the
car
they
both
noticed
freshly
ironed
curtains
at
the
windows
hodges
was
pounding
dust
from
a
carpet
on
the
line
housecleaning
inquired
penny
pausing
to
chat
with
the
old
man
yes
jenny
got
me
hard
at
it
he
grinned
she
been
tearin
the
house
upside
down
gettin
ready
for
the
new
roomer
oh
have
you
taken
one
penny
was
surprised
knowing
that
in
past
years
the
hodges
had
been
too
proud
to
rent
rooms
there
a
young
feller
moving
in
today
hodges
said
picking
up
the
carpet
beater
go
on
inside
jenny
tell
you
about
it
penny
and
weems
entered
the
cottage
where
the
seamstress
was
running
a
dust
mop
over
the
floors
she
was
somewhat
dismayed
to
see
the
housekeeper
oh
maud
i
been
so
busy
i
did
get
your
dresses
ready
to
be
tried
on
it
does
matter
replied
weems
what
this
about
a
new
roomer
i
always
said
i
would
have
one
cluttering
up
the
place
but
this
young
man
is
different
his
coming
here
well
i
interpret
it
as
another
sign
a
sign
of
what
inquired
penny
with
her
usual
directness
well
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
a
direct
message
from
the
spirit
world
to
take
him
into
our
home
he
came
here
last
night
instead
of
knocking
in
the
usual
way
he
rapped
six
times
in
succession
probably
he
was
the
one
who
sent
the
letter
said
penny
alertly
oh
no
he
did
know
anything
about
it
i
asked
him
what
is
his
name
mrs
hodges
al
gepper
he
such
a
nice
young
man
and
he
talks
so
refined
i
am
letting
him
have
the
entire
floor
upstairs
that
should
bring
you
a
nice
income
remarked
weems
i
am
asking
only
two
dollars
a
week
admitted
the
seamstress
he
said
he
could
pay
more
than
that
why
jenny
protested
weems
such
a
small
amount
hardly
will
cover
the
lights
and
various
extras
i
know
maud
but
i
could
turn
him
away
he
moved
his
apparatus
in
last
night
and
will
bring
his
personal
belongings
sometime
today
his
apparatus
echoed
penny
what
is
he
a
chemist
no
replied
the
seamstress
smiling
mysteriously
i
show
you
the
rooms
penny
and
weems
followed
the
woman
upstairs
the
upper
floor
was
divided
into
two
small
bedrooms
with
a
wide
sliding
door
between
which
could
be
opened
to
make
one
large
chamber
the
larger
of
the
rooms
had
been
cleared
of
its
usual
furniture
where
a
bed
previously
had
stood
was
a
circular
table
with
six
or
eight
chairs
and
behind
it
a
tall
cabinet
with
a
black
curtain
across
the
front
gepper
plans
to
use
this
room
for
his
studio
explained
hodges
penny
gaze
had
fastened
upon
the
cabinet
she
crossed
to
it
and
pulled
aside
the
curtain
inside
were
several
unpacked
boxes
and
a
suitcase
hodges
to
what
purpose
does
your
young
man
expect
to
put
this
studio
she
asked
i
do
know
he
did
tell
me
but
i
think
he
intends
to
carry
on
psychic
experiments
he
a
student
he
said
gepper
was
afraid
to
tell
you
the
truth
lest
you
refuse
to
rent
the
rooms
declared
penny
hodges
your
roomer
is
a
medium
why
do
you
think
so
because
i
seen
trappings
such
as
these
before
at
other
séance
chambers
replied
penny
hodges
you
must
send
him
away
before
he
involves
you
with
the
police
chapter
board
trouble
with
the
police
hodges
echoed
regarding
penny
with
unconcealed
dismay
how
can
it
be
illegal
to
rent
gepper
these
rooms
renting
the
rooms
is
illegal
penny
corrected
but
if
the
young
man
conducts
public
séances
here
filches
money
from
people
then
you
may
be
considered
a
party
to
the
scheme
this
city
has
a
local
ordinance
prohibiting
fortune
telling
mind
reading
and
the
like
i
am
sure
the
young
man
means
no
wrong
penny
commented
weems
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
overly
concerned
why
are
you
convinced
that
gepper
is
a
medium
does
this
cabinet
indicate
it
i
thought
it
was
some
sort
of
wardrobe
closet
hodges
admitted
al
gepper
is
a
medium
or
pretends
to
have
spiritualistic
powers
penny
repeated
in
my
opinion
you
be
very
unwise
to
allow
him
to
start
an
illegal
business
here
oh
dear
i
do
know
what
to
do
now
declared
the
seamstress
have
to
ask
pa
about
it
she
and
weems
started
downstairs
expecting
that
penny
would
follow
instead
the
girl
lingered
to
inspect
the
cabinet
on
the
lower
floor
a
door
slammed
and
there
were
footsteps
ascending
the
stairway
she
paid
no
heed
assuming
that
it
was
either
hodges
or
his
wife
who
approached
the
door
swung
open
turning
penny
saw
a
young
man
possibly
thirty
years
of
age
standing
on
the
threshold
his
dark
eyes
were
sharp
and
appraising
hello
he
said
without
smiling
are
you
afraid
a
monkey
may
jump
out
of
that
cabinet
penny
who
seldom
blushed
felt
a
wave
of
heat
creeping
over
her
cheeks
hello
she
stammered
you
must
be
hodges
new
roomer
al
gepper
at
your
service
who
are
you
girlie
you
guessed
it
said
penny
shortly
edging
away
from
the
cabinet
al
gepper
remained
in
the
doorway
blocking
the
exit
with
his
arm
he
did
not
move
as
the
girl
attempted
to
move
past
him
what
your
hurry
he
drawled
stick
around
and
let
get
acquainted
i
show
you
some
neat
card
tricks
thanks
but
i
have
time
mr
gepper
what
your
name
anyhow
he
persisted
you
not
daughter
no
only
a
friend
you
need
be
so
icy
about
it
he
rebuked
any
friend
of
is
a
friend
of
mine
i
never
make
friends
easily
penny
replied
for
that
matter
i
mind
telling
you
that
i
have
advised
hodges
not
to
rent
you
these
rooms
oh
you
have
inquired
the
man
his
eyes
hardening
and
what
business
is
it
of
yours
none
perhaps
i
merely
am
not
going
to
allow
her
to
be
taken
in
if
i
can
prevent
it
oh
indeed
do
you
mind
explaining
it
perfectly
obvious
that
you
one
of
these
fake
spiritualists
penny
accused
bluntly
your
nickname
should
be
al
a
little
are
you
the
man
retorted
but
you
have
style
now
i
may
be
able
to
use
you
in
my
business
you
admit
that
you
a
medium
i
am
a
spiritualist
not
a
fake
as
you
so
crudely
accuse
and
i
assure
you
i
have
no
intention
of
deceiving
or
taking
advantage
of
your
dear
friends
the
hodges
you
expect
to
use
these
rooms
for
public
séances
i
do
then
you
are
certain
to
get
the
hodges
into
trouble
with
the
police
not
unless
you
start
squawking
al
gepper
manner
changed
abruptly
he
grasped
penny
wrist
and
pushed
a
leering
face
close
to
hers
i
not
looking
for
any
trouble
from
you
or
anyone
else
see
if
you
try
to
make
it
you
wake
up
with
a
headache
penny
jerked
free
and
shouldering
through
the
door
raced
downstairs
glancing
back
she
saw
that
al
gepper
was
following
though
at
a
more
leisurely
pace
instantly
she
divined
that
he
intended
to
make
sure
no
report
of
the
incident
was
given
to
the
hodges
save
in
his
presence
weems
and
the
old
couple
were
talking
in
the
kitchen
well
ma
it
for
you
to
decide
hodges
was
saying
we
gave
our
word
to
the
young
feller
and
it
kinda
mean
to
turn
him
out
so
sudden
like
i
regret
penny
said
anything
about
the
matter
apologized
weems
you
know
how
and
impulsive
she
is
of
course
she
has
no
information
about
mr
gepper
oh
but
i
do
have
information
spoke
penny
from
the
doorway
gepper
has
just
admitted
that
he
intends
to
use
the
room
for
public
séances
is
that
true
defiantly
she
turned
to
face
the
young
man
who
had
followed
her
quite
true
he
acknowledged
loftily
one
who
has
a
great
psychic
gift
is
to
allow
the
world
to
benefit
from
one
talents
the
selection
of
this
house
as
a
temple
for
celestial
communication
was
not
mine
but
the
bidding
of
the
spirits
in
a
dream
i
was
instructed
to
come
here
and
take
up
residence
what
night
did
you
have
the
dream
questioned
hodges
deeply
impressed
it
was
june
fifteenth
the
very
night
we
heard
the
strange
rappings
on
our
bedroom
wall
dogonned
if
it
was
gepper
do
you
truly
believe
it
is
possible
to
communicate
with
the
spiritual
world
weems
inquired
politely
my
dear
madam
i
can
best
answer
by
offering
a
demonstration
have
you
a
ouija
board
in
the
house
yes
we
have
spoke
hodges
eagerly
pa
and
i
got
it
from
a
mail
order
house
years
ago
but
it
never
worked
for
us
you
fetch
it
hodges
brought
a
large
flat
board
which
bore
letters
and
figures
upon
it
he
placed
a
small
triangular
piece
with
cushioned
legs
this
is
supposed
to
spell
out
messages
ai
it
he
asked
ma
and
i
could
never
make
it
work
right
al
gepper
smiled
in
a
superior
way
and
placing
the
board
on
his
lap
motioned
for
weems
to
sit
opposite
him
however
before
the
housekeeper
could
obey
penny
slid
into
the
vacant
chair
the
medium
frowned
place
your
hands
lightly
on
the
triangular
piece
he
instructed
concentrate
with
me
as
we
await
a
message
from
the
spiritual
world
penny
fastened
her
eyes
on
the
distant
wall
with
a
blank
stare
a
minute
passed
the
ouija
board
made
several
convulsive
struggles
but
seemed
unable
to
move
the
spirits
encounter
resistance
the
medium
said
testily
they
can
send
no
message
when
one
attitude
is
antagonistic
shall
i
take
off
the
brakes
asked
penny
even
as
she
spoke
the
pointer
of
the
triangle
began
moving
rapidly
spelling
a
message
al
gepper
is
a
fraud
it
wrote
the
medium
sprang
to
his
feet
allowing
the
board
to
fall
from
his
lap
you
pushed
it
he
accused
the
test
was
unfair
why
the
very
idea
chuckled
penny
penny
please
allow
gepper
to
conduct
a
true
test
reproved
weems
severely
let
me
try
al
gepper
however
would
have
no
more
of
the
ouija
board
instead
he
took
a
pad
of
white
paper
from
his
pocket
seating
weems
at
the
kitchen
table
he
requested
her
to
write
a
message
which
without
being
shown
to
anyone
in
the
room
was
sealed
in
an
envelope
the
medium
pointedly
requested
penny
to
examine
the
envelope
to
assure
herself
the
writing
could
not
be
seen
through
the
paper
you
are
satisfied
that
i
have
not
read
the
message
he
asked
yes
penny
admitted
reluctantly
the
medium
took
the
envelope
ran
his
fingers
lightly
over
it
and
returned
it
still
sealed
to
weems
if
i
am
not
mistaken
madam
you
wrote
the
spirit
of
my
cousin
in
this
room
why
i
did
exclaimed
weems
those
were
the
exact
words
how
did
you
know
al
gepper
smiled
mysteriously
you
have
seen
nothing
madam
he
said
now
if
conditions
are
right
it
may
be
possible
for
us
to
learn
if
a
spirit
has
joined
our
group
lower
the
blinds
please
hodges
hastened
to
obey
with
the
kitchen
in
the
medium
motioned
for
his
audience
to
move
a
few
paces
away
taking
his
own
position
behind
the
kitchen
table
he
intoned
oh
spirit
if
you
are
with
us
in
the
room
signal
by
lifting
this
piece
of
furniture
slowly
the
man
moved
his
hands
above
the
table
at
first
nothing
happened
then
to
the
astonishment
of
his
audience
it
lifted
a
few
inches
from
the
floor
there
it
hung
suspended
a
moment
before
dropping
into
place
again
you
see
with
a
triumphant
ring
to
his
voice
the
medium
crossed
the
room
to
raise
the
window
shades
now
do
you
doubt
me
no
no
cried
hodges
tremulously
only
a
spirit
could
have
moved
that
table
maud
perhaps
it
your
cousin
david
the
medium
gazed
at
weems
with
sympathetic
interest
you
have
lost
a
loved
one
recently
he
inquired
cousin
david
and
i
never
were
well
acquainted
replied
the
housekeeper
that
was
why
i
was
so
surprised
when
he
left
me
an
inheritance
mrs
weems
remonstrated
penny
she
was
dismayed
by
the
revelation
so
casually
offered
no
doubt
you
would
like
to
communicate
with
your
departed
cousin
at
some
later
time
the
medium
said
smoothly
allow
me
to
offer
my
services
as
an
intermediary
no
charge
of
course
why
that
very
generous
of
you
mr
gepper
not
at
all
friends
of
the
hodges
are
my
friends
shall
we
set
a
definite
date
say
tomorrow
at
two
yes
i
come
that
is
if
the
hodges
are
to
be
present
assuredly
hodges
is
definitely
psychic
and
should
contribute
to
our
séance
it
was
with
the
greatest
of
difficulty
that
penny
finally
induced
the
housekeeper
to
leave
the
cottage
al
gepper
accompanied
them
to
the
door
tomorrow
at
two
he
repeated
smiling
slyly
at
penny
and
you
may
come
also
my
little
doubter
i
assure
you
it
will
be
well
worth
your
time
chapter
celestial
penny
tell
me
the
truth
weems
urged
as
they
drove
home
together
did
you
push
the
ouija
board
of
course
laughed
penny
but
if
i
had
al
gepper
would
have
he
was
trying
hard
enough
he
said
you
were
resisting
the
spirits
that
was
the
worst
sort
of
nonsense
penny
returned
impatiently
gepper
is
a
fraud
and
i
wish
you
had
told
him
about
your
inheritance
how
can
you
accuse
him
of
being
a
fraud
after
you
saw
his
marvelous
demonstration
the
table
actually
rose
from
the
floor
i
know
it
did
penny
acknowledged
unwillingly
but
it
must
have
been
trickery
how
could
it
have
been
the
table
was
an
ordinary
one
hodges
uses
it
every
day
of
her
life
i
do
know
how
he
did
it
penny
responded
all
the
same
i
am
sure
he
a
trickster
promise
me
you
wo
tell
him
anything
more
about
yourself
or
the
inheritance
very
well
i
promise
if
it
gives
you
satisfaction
the
housekeeper
replied
however
i
do
intend
to
keep
my
appointment
penny
had
no
opportunity
to
relate
to
her
father
what
had
occurred
at
the
hodges
home
for
parker
was
absent
on
a
business
trip
to
a
distant
town
feeling
that
she
must
tell
someone
she
sought
louise
sidell
and
they
discussed
every
angle
of
the
affair
will
you
attend
the
séance
with
mrs
weems
louise
asked
her
curiously
will
i
penny
repeated
i
be
right
there
with
bells
i
intend
to
expose
al
gepper
if
it
the
last
act
of
my
life
returning
home
later
in
the
afternoon
she
found
weems
sitting
on
the
living
room
floor
sorting
a
drawer
of
old
photographs
you
not
packing
your
things
already
penny
asked
in
alarm
only
these
photographs
the
housekeeper
responded
i
would
have
started
the
task
only
i
got
into
it
when
the
agent
came
agent
a
man
from
the
clamont
photograph
studio
never
heard
of
the
place
it
opening
this
week
they
having
a
special
offer
three
old
photographs
enlarged
for
only
cents
i
gave
the
man
cousin
david
picture
and
two
others
that
is
a
bargain
remarked
penny
i
wish
i
had
been
here
the
evening
meal
was
served
and
afterwards
weems
devoted
herself
to
the
reading
of
travel
books
borrowed
from
the
library
penny
could
find
no
occupation
to
satisfy
her
she
turned
the
radio
on
switched
it
off
again
and
wandered
restlessly
from
room
to
room
finally
she
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
louise
how
about
a
little
adventure
she
proposed
and
do
ask
for
explanations
will
we
be
home
by
ten
that
the
parental
deadline
oh
yes
we
make
it
easily
meet
me
at
the
corner
of
carabel
and
clinton
streets
weems
was
so
engrossed
in
her
book
that
she
merely
nodded
as
penny
explained
that
she
and
louise
were
going
for
a
walk
reaching
the
appointed
corner
the
girl
found
her
chum
awaiting
her
tell
me
about
this
adventure
she
commanded
where
are
we
going
to
the
celestial
temple
lou
at
least
we
look
at
it
from
the
outside
meetings
are
held
there
nearly
every
night
at
eight
penny
i
do
think
i
care
to
go
nonsense
the
meetings
are
open
to
the
public
are
they
we
have
a
very
interesting
time
oh
all
right
louise
consented
reluctantly
but
i
ca
understand
why
you
so
interested
in
the
place
the
girls
took
a
bus
to
the
end
of
the
line
then
walked
three
blocks
until
they
came
to
butternut
lane
for
long
stretches
there
were
only
scattered
houses
and
the
street
lamps
were
far
between
becoming
increasingly
uneasy
louise
urged
her
chum
to
turn
back
why
we
at
our
destination
now
penny
protested
i
am
sure
that
must
be
the
building
she
pointed
to
an
old
rectangular
brick
structure
only
a
few
yards
ahead
obviously
it
once
had
been
a
church
for
there
was
a
high
bell
tower
and
behind
the
building
a
cluster
of
neglected
tombstones
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
the
evenly
spaced
windows
were
illuminated
and
music
could
be
heard
are
you
sure
this
is
the
place
louise
inquired
dubiously
it
looks
like
a
church
to
me
and
they
holding
a
service
oh
the
building
has
been
used
for
such
purposes
in
over
fifteen
years
penny
explained
i
investigated
so
i
know
its
history
until
three
years
ago
it
was
used
as
a
county
fire
station
only
recently
it
was
reclaimed
by
this
omar
society
of
celestial
thought
the
girls
moved
closer
through
an
open
window
they
were
able
to
see
fifteen
or
twenty
people
seated
in
the
pews
a
woman
played
a
wheezing
organ
while
a
man
led
the
singing
let
go
inside
penny
proposed
louise
held
back
oh
no
we
can
see
everything
from
here
it
looks
as
if
it
were
a
very
stupid
sort
of
meeting
appearances
are
often
deceiving
i
want
a
ringside
seat
penny
pulled
her
chum
toward
the
entrance
door
there
they
hesitated
reading
a
large
placard
which
bore
the
invitation
public
is
invited
services
at
eight
we
part
of
the
public
lou
urged
penny
come
along
she
boldly
opened
the
door
and
there
was
no
retreat
heads
turned
slightly
as
the
girls
entered
the
rear
of
the
temple
as
quickly
they
turned
forward
again
but
not
before
penny
had
gained
an
impression
of
sharp
appraising
faces
a
man
arose
bowed
and
offered
the
girls
his
bench
although
many
others
were
available
they
slipped
into
the
pew
accepting
a
song
book
which
was
placed
in
louise
hand
while
her
chum
sang
in
a
thin
squeaky
voice
penny
allowed
her
gaze
to
wander
over
the
room
at
the
far
end
she
saw
a
door
which
apparently
opened
into
the
bell
tower
on
a
slightly
raised
platform
where
the
leader
stood
were
two
cabinets
somewhat
similar
to
the
one
she
had
seen
at
hodges
cottage
otherwise
there
was
nothing
of
unusual
interest
the
services
were
decorous
to
the
point
of
being
boring
yet
as
the
meeting
went
on
penny
and
louise
both
felt
that
they
were
being
studied
more
than
once
they
surprised
persons
gazing
at
them
at
the
conclusion
of
the
session
which
lasted
no
longer
than
thirty
minutes
the
leader
asked
the
audience
if
any
brother
were
present
who
wished
to
attempt
a
spirit
communication
immediately
penny
sat
up
a
bit
straighter
anticipating
that
interesting
demonstrations
were
in
store
nor
was
she
mistaken
a
thin
man
went
to
the
rostrum
and
in
a
loud
voice
began
to
call
upon
the
spirits
to
make
known
their
presence
signs
were
at
once
forthcoming
the
empty
pews
began
to
dance
as
if
alive
the
speaker
table
lifted
a
foot
from
the
floor
and
a
pitcher
of
water
fell
from
it
smashing
into
a
dozen
pieces
louise
her
eyes
dilated
with
fear
edged
closer
to
penny
let
go
she
pleaded
penny
shook
her
head
a
woman
dressed
in
blue
silk
glided
down
the
aisle
stopping
beside
the
girls
she
held
a
tray
upon
which
were
a
number
of
objects
an
opal
ring
a
knife
and
several
pins
dearie
she
said
to
penny
if
you
would
care
to
have
a
message
from
a
departed
soul
place
a
trinket
in
this
collection
any
personal
object
our
leader
will
then
exhort
the
spirit
to
appear
no
thank
you
replied
louise
without
giving
her
chum
a
chance
to
speak
perhaps
you
would
prefer
a
private
reading
the
woman
murmured
i
give
them
at
my
home
and
the
fee
is
trivial
only
a
dollar
thank
you
no
louise
repeated
firmly
i
not
interested
the
woman
shrugged
and
moved
on
down
the
aisle
pausing
beside
an
elderly
man
to
whom
she
addressed
herself
lou
why
did
you
discourage
her
penny
whispered
we
might
have
learned
something
i
learned
quite
enough
i
leaving
louise
squeezed
past
her
chum
heading
for
the
exit
penny
had
no
choice
but
to
follow
before
they
could
reach
the
door
it
suddenly
opened
from
the
outside
a
young
man
who
had
not
bothered
to
remove
his
hat
entered
seeing
the
girls
he
abruptly
halted
then
turned
and
retreated
penny
quickened
her
step
taking
louise
hand
she
pulled
her
along
at
a
faster
pace
they
reached
the
vestibule
it
was
deserted
penny
peered
up
and
down
the
dark
street
well
he
gone
she
remarked
who
louise
questioned
in
a
puzzled
voice
you
mean
that
man
who
entered
the
temple
and
then
left
so
suddenly
i
do
responded
penny
unless
my
eyes
tricked
me
he
was
none
other
than
al
gepper
chapter
message
for
i
do
know
anyone
answering
to
that
name
remarked
louise
however
the
fellow
did
act
as
if
he
were
retreating
from
us
penny
glanced
up
and
down
the
dark
street
no
one
was
to
be
seen
and
since
so
little
time
had
elapsed
she
reasoned
that
the
man
had
taken
refuge
either
in
the
high
weeds
or
the
nearby
cemetery
it
must
have
been
gepper
she
declared
naturally
he
would
care
to
meet
me
here
quickly
penny
recounted
the
events
of
the
afternoon
then
you
think
he
may
be
connected
with
the
temple
penny
that
would
be
my
guess
lou
this
place
is
nothing
but
a
blind
the
members
of
the
society
pretend
to
be
honest
spiritualists
while
in
reality
they
charlatans
they
hold
services
for
one
purpose
only
to
solicit
persons
for
private
readings
is
that
illegal
of
course
it
is
the
police
should
raid
the
place
then
why
do
they
penny
dad
says
it
because
they
been
unable
to
obtain
sufficient
evidence
but
they
have
it
after
we
report
what
we
seen
tonight
how
do
you
suppose
they
made
things
jump
around
as
if
they
were
alive
louise
remarked
as
the
girls
walked
slowly
toward
home
it
frightened
me
everything
was
done
by
trickery
i
sure
of
that
lou
just
as
soon
as
dad
returns
i
shall
make
a
full
report
to
him
we
see
what
he
can
do
about
it
by
the
time
penny
arrived
home
weems
had
retired
to
her
room
however
the
light
still
burned
and
the
door
was
open
a
crack
rapping
the
girl
entered
for
she
was
eager
to
tell
the
housekeeper
about
her
visit
to
the
celestial
temple
weems
sat
at
the
desk
hastily
she
closed
one
of
the
drawers
and
turned
the
key
you
startled
me
penny
she
exclaimed
i
do
wish
you
would
give
more
warning
before
you
descend
upon
one
sorry
apologized
penny
glancing
curiously
toward
the
desk
oh
i
see
you
see
what
demanded
the
housekeeper
six
thousand
dollars
reposing
in
a
desk
drawer
weems
look
of
consternation
betrayed
her
she
glanced
at
the
locked
drawer
and
then
laughed
for
an
instant
i
thought
you
actually
could
see
the
money
penny
then
my
guess
was
right
i
keep
the
money
in
the
drawer
weems
admitted
penny
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
drawing
up
her
knees
for
a
chin
rest
weems
do
you
think
it
risky
keeping
so
much
money
here
it
will
only
be
for
a
few
days
penny
i
have
it
converted
into
traveler
cheques
as
soon
as
i
am
ready
to
start
west
the
desk
does
seem
a
safe
place
to
me
you
the
only
person
who
knows
where
i
keep
the
money
penny
oh
yes
i
told
hodges
but
she
is
to
be
trusted
no
one
can
steal
it
as
long
as
i
have
the
key
weems
tapped
a
black
velvet
ribbon
which
she
wore
about
her
neck
i
keep
this
on
me
day
and
night
she
declared
no
thief
ever
will
get
it
way
from
me
penny
said
nothing
more
about
the
matter
instead
she
launched
into
a
highly
colored
account
of
her
visit
to
the
celestial
temple
the
housekeeper
expressed
disapproval
remarking
that
she
never
would
have
granted
permission
had
she
known
in
advance
where
the
girls
were
going
nevertheless
her
eager
questions
made
it
evident
that
she
was
deeply
interested
in
the
demonstration
which
had
been
witnessed
i
do
see
how
you
can
call
it
trickery
she
protested
you
have
no
proof
penny
never
in
the
world
will
i
believe
that
spirits
can
make
tables
do
a
dance
weems
probably
the
furniture
had
special
wiring
or
something
of
the
sort
you
ca
say
that
about
the
table
at
hodges
penny
no
it
seemed
to
be
just
an
ordinary
piece
of
furniture
the
girl
admitted
reluctantly
all
the
same
al
gepper
is
a
fraud
and
i
wish
you
would
attend
his
old
séance
tomorrow
but
penny
i
gave
my
promise
i
can
run
over
to
the
house
and
tell
him
you
changed
your
mind
weems
shook
her
head
no
penny
i
am
curious
to
learn
if
he
will
be
able
to
communicate
with
the
spirits
tomorrow
séance
should
provide
a
genuine
test
the
man
knows
nothing
about
me
or
my
ancestors
hodges
probably
has
provided
all
the
information
he
require
i
telephoned
her
yesterday
and
requested
her
not
to
tell
gepper
anything
about
me
she
respect
my
wishes
the
test
should
prove
a
true
one
penny
sighed
and
arose
from
the
bed
knowing
weems
as
she
did
she
realized
that
her
opinion
could
not
be
changed
by
argument
it
was
her
hope
that
al
gepper
would
discredit
himself
by
failing
in
the
séance
penny
please
promise
that
you
do
nothing
outrageous
tomorrow
weems
begged
as
the
girl
started
to
leave
i
am
sure
gepper
feels
that
you
are
antagonistic
i
try
to
behave
myself
penny
laughed
yes
we
give
gepper
a
chance
to
prove
what
he
can
do
at
two
the
following
afternoon
she
and
weems
presented
themselves
at
the
hodges
cottage
both
hodges
and
his
wife
who
were
to
sit
in
at
the
séance
were
trembling
with
anticipation
gepper
is
simply
wonderful
the
seamstress
confided
to
weems
he
tells
me
that
i
have
great
healing
powers
as
well
as
a
psychic
personality
jenny
i
hope
you
have
told
him
anything
about
me
the
housekeeper
mentioned
oh
no
maud
for
that
matter
he
said
nothing
about
you
since
you
were
here
weems
cast
penny
an
glance
which
was
not
lost
upon
al
gepper
who
entered
the
room
at
that
moment
i
am
ready
for
you
ladies
he
said
kindly
follow
me
in
the
upstairs
room
blinds
had
been
drawn
al
gepper
indicated
that
his
audience
was
to
occupy
the
chairs
around
the
circular
table
before
we
attempt
to
communicate
with
the
departed
souls
i
wish
to
assure
you
that
i
employ
no
trickery
he
announced
looking
hard
at
penny
you
may
examine
the
table
or
the
cabinet
if
you
wish
oh
no
gepper
murmured
hodges
we
trust
you
i
look
if
you
do
mind
said
penny
she
peered
beneath
the
table
thumped
it
several
times
and
pulled
aside
the
curtain
of
the
cabinet
it
was
empty
now
if
you
are
quite
satisfied
shall
we
begin
purred
gepper
it
will
make
it
much
easier
if
each
one
of
you
will
give
me
a
personal
object
a
la
the
celestial
temple
method
muttered
penny
beneath
her
breath
what
was
that
questioned
the
medium
sharply
nothing
i
was
merely
thinking
to
myself
then
please
think
more
quietly
i
must
warn
you
that
this
séance
can
not
be
successful
unless
each
person
present
concentrates
entering
into
the
occasion
with
the
deepest
of
sincerity
i
assure
you
i
am
as
sincere
as
yourself
penny
responded
gravely
hodges
deposited
his
gold
watch
on
the
table
his
wife
offered
a
pin
and
weems
a
plain
band
ring
penny
parted
with
a
handkerchief
after
everyone
was
seated
about
the
table
al
gepper
played
several
phonograph
records
all
the
while
exhorting
the
spirits
to
appear
taking
weems
ring
from
the
tray
before
him
he
pressed
it
to
his
forehead
a
convulsive
shudder
wracked
his
body
someone
comes
to
me
he
mumbled
someone
comes
giving
the
name
of
david
david
swester
my
cousin
breathed
weems
in
awe
he
is
tall
and
dark
with
a
scar
over
his
left
eye
resumed
the
medium
i
see
him
plainly
now
that
david
cried
the
housekeeper
leaning
forward
in
her
eagerness
david
have
you
a
message
for
us
the
medium
intoned
there
was
a
long
silence
during
which
the
man
could
be
seen
writhing
and
twisting
in
the
then
his
voice
began
again
david
has
a
message
for
a
person
called
maud
i
am
maud
said
weems
tremulously
oh
what
does
he
say
that
he
is
well
and
happy
in
the
spirit
world
but
he
is
worried
about
maud
worried
about
me
why
the
medium
again
seemed
to
undergo
physical
suffering
but
presently
the
message
came
through
although
not
in
an
entirely
clear
form
david
voice
has
faded
i
am
not
certain
but
it
has
something
to
do
with
six
thousand
dollars
the
exact
amount
he
left
to
me
weems
murmured
david
is
afraid
that
you
will
not
have
the
wisdom
to
invest
the
money
wisely
he
warns
you
that
the
present
place
where
you
have
it
deposited
is
not
safe
he
will
tell
you
what
to
do
with
it
now
the
voice
is
fading
again
david
has
gone
with
another
convulsive
shudder
al
gepper
straightened
from
the
position
into
which
he
had
slumped
resuming
his
normal
tone
he
said
that
is
all
the
connection
with
cousin
david
has
been
broken
ca
we
contact
him
again
weems
asked
in
disappointment
not
today
possibly
tomorrow
at
this
same
hour
could
you
call
up
another
spirit
by
using
my
pin
or
pa
watch
hodges
suggested
wistfully
al
gepper
raised
one
of
the
window
blinds
i
am
very
very
tired
he
said
this
séance
was
particularly
exhausting
due
to
the
presence
of
someone
antagonistic
tomorrow
if
conditions
are
right
i
hope
actually
to
materialize
cousin
david
the
poor
soul
is
trying
so
hard
to
get
a
message
through
to
the
one
he
calls
maud
you
mean
i
be
able
to
see
him
the
housekeeper
asked
incredulously
i
hope
and
believe
so
i
must
rest
now
after
a
séance
i
should
refresh
myself
with
sleep
of
course
agreed
hodges
we
are
selfish
to
overtax
you
recovering
their
trinkets
the
elderly
couple
and
weems
went
from
the
room
penny
was
the
last
to
leave
well
sister
inquired
the
medium
in
a
low
voice
were
you
convinced
or
do
you
still
think
that
you
can
show
up
al
gepper
i
think
said
penny
softly
that
you
are
a
very
clever
man
but
clever
as
you
are
one
of
your
ghosts
may
yet
lead
you
to
the
city
jail
chapter
david
when
penny
reached
the
lower
floor
she
found
weems
and
the
hodges
excitedly
discussing
the
séance
the
seamstress
and
her
husband
emphatically
declared
that
they
had
given
the
medium
no
information
regarding
either
the
housekeeper
or
the
deceased
cousin
david
then
there
can
be
only
one
explanation
weems
said
we
were
truly
in
communication
with
a
departed
spirit
do
you
agree
penny
inquired
hodges
i
am
afraid
i
ca
she
replied
the
test
was
a
fair
one
weems
insisted
gepper
could
have
described
cousin
david
so
accurately
if
he
had
actually
seen
him
as
he
materialized
from
the
spirit
world
al
gepper
could
have
obtained
much
of
his
information
from
persons
in
riverview
penny
responded
about
me
perhaps
the
housekeeper
conceded
but
not
about
cousin
david
why
i
doubt
if
anyone
save
myself
knew
he
had
a
scar
over
his
eye
he
received
it
in
an
automobile
accident
twelve
or
thirteen
years
ago
just
think
murmured
hodges
tomorrow
you
may
actually
be
able
to
see
your
departed
cousin
in
vain
penny
argued
that
al
gepper
was
a
trickster
she
was
unable
to
offer
the
slightest
evidence
to
support
her
contention
while
on
the
other
hand
the
hodges
reminded
her
that
the
medium
had
never
asked
one
penny
for
his
services
from
the
cottage
penny
went
directly
to
the
office
feeling
certain
that
her
father
would
have
returned
there
from
his
trip
nor
was
she
mistaken
gaining
admittance
to
the
private
office
she
wasted
no
words
in
relating
everything
which
had
transpired
during
his
absence
her
father
attention
was
flattering
penny
you
actually
saw
all
this
he
questioned
when
she
had
finished
oh
yes
at
the
celestial
temple
louise
was
with
me
too
we
thought
you
might
take
up
the
matter
with
the
police
that
exactly
what
i
will
do
decided
parker
i
turned
the
matter
over
in
my
mind
for
several
days
the
will
take
the
initiative
in
driving
these
mediums
character
readers
and
the
like
out
of
riverview
oh
dad
i
was
hoping
you
say
that
parker
pressed
a
desk
buzzer
summoning
dewitt
he
told
of
his
plan
to
launch
an
active
campaign
nothing
will
please
me
better
chief
responded
the
city
editor
where
do
we
start
we
tip
the
police
to
what
is
going
on
at
the
celestial
temple
have
them
send
detectives
there
for
tonight
meeting
then
when
the
usual
starts
arrests
can
be
made
have
photographers
and
a
good
reporter
on
hand
that
should
start
the
ball
rolling
agreed
dewitt
i
assign
jerry
livingston
to
the
story
salt
sommers
is
my
best
photographer
get
busy
right
away
parker
ordered
we
play
the
story
big
tomorrow
give
it
a
spread
how
about
al
gepper
penny
inquired
after
dewitt
had
gone
could
he
be
arrested
without
involving
the
hodges
not
very
easily
if
he
lives
at
their
place
has
he
accepted
money
for
the
séances
he
conducts
there
he
has
taken
any
yet
from
weems
i
am
sure
he
must
have
other
customers
you
have
no
proof
of
it
no
suppose
we
forget
al
gepper
for
the
time
being
and
concentrate
on
the
celestial
temple
parker
proposed
in
the
meantime
learn
everything
you
can
about
the
man
methods
no
assignment
would
please
me
more
dad
i
the
same
as
promised
gepper
he
land
in
jail
and
i
want
to
make
good
parker
began
to
pace
the
floor
i
write
a
scorching
editorial
he
said
we
fight
ignorance
with
information
our
reporters
must
learn
how
these
mediums
do
their
tricks
and
expose
them
to
the
gullible
public
i
do
everything
i
can
to
help
penny
promised
eagerly
may
i
have
al
gepper
for
my
particular
fish
bait
he
your
assignment
and
i
depending
upon
you
to
see
that
he
work
any
of
his
trickery
on
weems
if
she
ca
be
persuaded
to
remain
away
from
the
hodges
then
we
must
protect
her
as
best
we
can
i
try
to
accompany
her
every
time
she
goes
there
dad
i
am
afraid
he
may
be
after
her
money
gepper
does
know
she
inherited
six
thousand
dollars
parker
asked
in
alarm
yes
she
dropped
the
information
that
she
had
come
into
money
he
supplied
figures
himself
i
wonder
how
i
have
the
slightest
idea
dad
gepper
is
as
clever
a
man
as
ever
i
met
honestly
it
would
surprise
me
if
he
does
produce
cousin
david
at
tomorrow
séance
parker
snorted
in
disgust
tommyrot
the
man
will
make
an
excuse
about
the
conditions
not
being
right
and
fail
perhaps
but
he
seems
pretty
confident
you
expect
to
attend
the
séance
oh
definitely
jungle
beasts
could
keep
me
away
then
be
alert
every
instant
without
appearing
too
suspicious
of
course
try
to
learn
how
the
man
accomplishes
his
tricks
leave
it
to
me
chuckled
penny
al
gepper
is
due
for
his
first
shock
when
he
wakes
up
tomorrow
and
reads
that
the
celestial
temple
has
been
raided
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
that
place
is
one
of
his
favorite
haunts
leaving
the
newspaper
office
penny
went
directly
home
she
longed
to
stop
at
the
sidell
home
but
she
had
promised
her
father
to
say
nothing
about
the
planned
raid
until
it
was
an
accomplished
fact
feeling
the
need
of
work
to
occupy
her
time
she
washed
the
maroon
car
and
waxed
the
fading
paint
of
leaping
lena
at
six
her
father
came
home
for
dinner
any
news
penny
asked
running
to
meet
him
everything
set
he
answered
dewitt
laid
your
information
before
the
police
tonight
three
detectives
will
attend
the
meeting
at
the
temple
if
anything
out
of
the
way
happens
the
raid
will
be
staged
penny
was
so
tense
with
expectation
that
she
was
unable
to
do
justice
to
the
delicious
dinner
which
weems
had
prepared
her
father
too
seemed
unusually
restless
after
dinner
he
made
a
pretense
of
reading
the
paper
but
actually
his
eyes
did
not
see
the
print
the
hands
of
the
clock
scarcely
appeared
to
move
so
slowly
did
time
pass
eight
came
then
nine
suddenly
the
telephone
rang
penny
was
away
in
an
instant
to
answer
it
from
the
next
room
she
called
to
her
father
it
for
you
dad
dewitt
i
think
i
told
him
to
telephone
me
as
soon
as
the
raid
was
staged
parker
arose
and
went
quickly
to
take
the
receiver
penny
hovered
at
his
elbow
hello
dewitt
the
publisher
asked
and
after
a
slight
pause
oh
i
see
no
i
do
think
penny
was
mistaken
it
more
likely
there
was
a
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
turned
toward
penny
who
anticipated
the
news
the
raid
was
a
failure
yes
penny
detectives
spent
two
hours
at
the
meeting
nothing
happened
it
was
impossible
to
make
arrests
they
must
have
been
recognized
as
detectives
undoubtedly
others
will
be
assigned
to
the
case
i
doubt
it
penny
dewitt
reports
that
the
police
have
become
convinced
that
the
spiritualists
who
use
the
temple
are
not
operating
for
profit
louise
and
i
know
better
because
she
was
approached
penny
anxiously
regarded
her
father
dad
even
if
the
police
do
give
up
we
wo
will
we
no
we
in
this
fight
and
we
stay
in
it
he
answered
grimly
we
put
some
new
teeth
in
our
trap
and
the
next
time
it
sprung
i
warrant
you
we
catch
a
crook
chapter
promptly
at
two
the
following
afternoon
penny
and
weems
presented
themselves
at
the
hodges
cottage
for
the
appointed
séance
already
gepper
awaited
them
in
the
darkened
apartment
on
the
second
floor
penny
glance
about
the
room
found
everything
in
the
same
order
as
upon
the
previous
visit
save
that
an
easel
with
a
large
black
sheet
of
artist
paper
stood
beside
the
cabinet
she
moved
as
if
to
examine
it
al
gepper
intercepted
her
by
saying
sit
here
if
you
please
beside
weems
i
call
the
hodges
and
we
start
at
once
the
medium
went
to
the
door
and
shouted
down
the
stairway
penny
noticed
that
he
remained
where
he
could
watch
her
every
move
in
a
mirror
which
hung
on
the
wall
she
shrewdly
guessed
that
he
was
afraid
she
might
attempt
to
examine
either
the
cabinet
or
the
easel
and
hodges
came
in
response
to
the
call
taking
chairs
about
the
circular
table
the
gaze
which
they
fastened
upon
al
gepper
was
almost
worshipful
now
today
i
hope
to
materialize
the
spirit
of
cousin
david
announced
the
medium
the
task
will
be
difficult
as
you
must
realize
after
the
séance
begins
i
am
compelled
to
request
absolute
quiet
the
slightest
movement
may
frighten
away
the
spirits
why
are
spirits
so
timid
asked
penny
because
their
beings
are
so
sensitive
that
they
instantly
feel
an
unfriendly
presence
the
man
responded
glibly
please
hold
hands
and
use
every
precaution
that
contact
is
not
broken
weems
took
one
of
penny
hands
and
hodges
the
other
hodges
sat
next
to
her
husband
after
lowering
black
curtains
over
the
window
blinds
to
further
darken
the
room
the
medium
returned
to
his
chair
those
at
the
table
were
unable
to
distinguish
his
form
and
for
a
time
there
was
no
sound
save
the
scratching
music
of
a
phonograph
record
presently
the
medium
exhorted
the
spirit
of
cousin
david
to
appear
for
at
least
ten
minutes
there
was
no
indication
that
communication
was
to
be
established
then
a
cowbell
tinkled
causing
weems
to
shake
and
tremble
are
you
there
david
called
the
medium
the
bell
jingled
violently
we
are
ready
david
intoned
the
medium
have
you
a
message
for
us
to
penny
amazement
a
pair
of
shapely
white
hands
slowly
materialized
apparently
pulling
aside
the
curtain
of
the
cabinet
above
the
head
in
the
darkness
they
glowed
with
a
weird
phosphorescent
light
next
appeared
a
slate
upon
which
luminous
words
were
written
i
am
the
spirit
of
cousin
david
is
maud
here
yes
yes
responded
weems
quivering
with
excitement
have
you
a
message
for
me
again
the
hand
wrote
my
happiness
in
this
world
beyond
is
disturbed
maud
do
not
squander
the
money
which
i
gave
to
you
squander
it
the
housekeeper
said
aloud
why
i
scarcely
spent
a
penny
a
trip
to
california
is
wrote
the
hand
invest
your
money
in
good
eight
per
cent
securities
there
are
many
excellent
companies
the
brantwell
corporation
white
and
edwards
the
bierkamp
company
the
slate
vanished
and
once
more
the
jingling
of
the
cowbell
denoted
that
the
spirit
was
moving
away
the
medium
spoke
contact
has
been
broken
shall
we
try
to
reach
cousin
david
again
oh
please
pleaded
weems
i
do
know
what
to
do
now
planned
on
the
western
trip
and
i
ca
understand
why
cousin
david
should
advise
me
to
give
it
up
i
would
go
agin
the
spirits
if
i
was
you
advised
hodges
you
better
change
your
plans
maud
but
how
can
i
be
certain
that
the
message
came
from
cousin
david
the
housekeeper
quavered
oh
dear
i
am
so
upset
if
only
i
could
be
certain
madam
i
hope
you
do
not
distrust
me
said
al
gepper
reprovingly
oh
no
it
not
that
i
just
upset
perhaps
if
you
actually
saw
your
cousin
it
would
set
your
mind
at
rest
is
it
possible
to
see
him
i
can
not
promise
but
we
will
try
hold
hands
again
please
and
everyone
concentrate
there
followed
an
interval
during
which
the
medium
pleaded
with
the
spirit
of
cousin
david
to
return
and
show
himself
suddenly
the
group
was
startled
to
see
a
luminous
banjo
move
high
through
the
air
unsupported
by
any
hand
it
began
to
play
down
upon
the
swanee
river
midway
through
the
selection
the
music
broke
off
and
the
banjo
disappeared
an
instant
later
hodges
uttered
a
choked
cry
the
easel
look
at
it
maud
all
eyes
turned
toward
the
painter
canvas
as
the
medium
focused
a
flashlight
upon
it
the
face
of
an
elderly
man
slowly
materialized
on
the
blank
surface
the
picture
appearing
in
red
blue
and
finally
black
oil
paint
it
cousin
david
whispered
weems
gripping
penny
hand
so
tightly
that
it
hurt
he
looks
exactly
as
he
did
when
last
i
saw
him
the
medium
extinguished
his
light
and
again
the
room
was
dark
weems
chair
creaked
as
she
stirred
restlessly
hodges
heavy
breathing
could
be
plainly
heard
there
was
no
other
sound
everyone
waited
in
tense
expectancy
sensing
that
the
climax
of
the
séance
was
at
hand
suddenly
behind
al
gepper
chair
a
spot
of
ethereal
light
appeared
as
penny
watched
it
grew
in
size
until
the
figure
had
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
man
then
to
her
further
amazement
it
slowly
rose
toward
the
ceiling
hovering
above
weems
chair
throughout
the
séance
penny
had
remained
firm
in
her
conviction
that
the
medium
had
resorted
to
trickery
to
produce
his
startling
effects
although
she
could
not
be
sure
she
thought
that
several
times
he
had
slipped
from
his
chair
to
enter
the
conveniently
placed
cabinet
she
also
believed
that
the
only
way
he
could
have
materialized
the
ghost
was
by
donning
luminous
robes
i
end
his
little
game
once
and
for
all
she
thought
deliberately
she
waited
until
the
ghostly
figure
floated
close
to
her
own
chair
then
with
a
sudden
upward
spring
she
snatched
at
it
greatly
to
her
chagrin
her
hand
encountered
nothing
solid
with
the
speed
of
lightning
the
figure
streaked
toward
the
cabinet
behind
al
gepper
chair
and
was
seen
no
more
arising
the
medium
switched
on
the
room
lights
his
face
was
white
with
anger
i
warned
you
to
make
no
move
he
said
harshly
to
penny
you
deliberately
disobeyed
me
oh
penny
why
did
you
do
it
wailed
weems
i
was
so
eager
to
get
another
message
from
cousin
david
his
spirit
has
been
frightened
away
announced
the
medium
it
will
be
impossible
ever
to
recall
him
for
that
matter
i
shall
never
again
conduct
a
séance
with
this
young
person
present
she
is
a
disturbing
element
oh
penny
you
ruined
everything
said
weems
accusingly
why
do
you
act
so
outrageously
penny
started
to
speak
and
then
changed
her
mind
weems
the
seamstress
and
her
husband
all
were
gazing
at
her
with
deep
reproach
she
realized
that
there
was
nothing
she
could
say
which
would
make
them
understand
she
arose
and
walked
to
the
easel
the
painting
of
cousin
david
remained
clearly
visible
she
touched
it
and
then
glanced
at
her
finger
which
bore
a
streak
of
red
the
paint
was
still
wet
penny
stared
at
her
finger
a
moment
lifting
her
eyes
she
met
the
triumphant
gaze
of
al
gepper
not
even
a
skillful
artist
could
have
painted
a
picture
so
quickly
he
said
with
a
smirk
only
a
spirit
would
have
the
ability
you
are
dumbfounded
my
little
one
no
just
plain
dumb
answered
penny
i
salute
you
mr
gepper
without
waiting
for
weems
she
turned
and
went
from
the
house
now
how
he
do
it
she
muttered
i
saw
everything
and
yet
i
am
more
in
the
dark
than
ever
but
i
am
sure
of
one
thing
unless
i
work
fast
al
gepper
is
almost
certain
to
obtain
weems
inheritance
chapter
one
of
penny
first
acts
upon
arriving
home
was
to
scan
the
telephone
directory
under
the
heading
investment
firms
the
three
companies
mentioned
during
the
séance
white
and
edwards
brantwell
and
bierkamp
were
unlisted
evidently
there
are
no
such
firms
in
riverview
she
reflected
but
why
was
weems
advised
to
invest
her
money
with
one
of
them
it
looks
very
suspicious
to
me
not
until
after
five
did
weems
return
from
the
hodges
she
seemed
rather
upset
and
when
penny
tried
to
bring
up
the
subject
of
the
séance
said
distantly
please
penny
i
prefer
not
to
discuss
it
your
conduct
was
disgraceful
i
apologize
for
grabbing
at
the
ghost
weems
i
only
did
it
to
prove
that
al
gepper
is
a
fraud
your
motives
were
quite
apparent
one
could
not
blame
gepper
for
being
angry
oh
weems
said
penny
in
desperation
how
can
you
be
taken
in
by
his
smooth
line
his
one
purpose
is
to
obtain
your
money
you
are
very
unjust
the
housekeeper
responded
today
i
tried
to
pay
gepper
for
the
séance
and
he
would
not
accept
one
penny
that
because
he
is
playing
for
higher
stakes
it
no
use
discussing
the
matter
with
you
weems
shrugged
you
are
prejudiced
and
will
give
the
man
credit
for
nothing
i
give
him
credit
for
being
very
clever
weems
please
promise
that
you
not
allow
him
to
invest
your
money
for
you
i
have
no
intention
of
doing
so
penny
it
does
seem
to
me
that
i
should
consider
cousin
david
wishes
in
the
matter
very
likely
i
shall
abandon
my
plans
for
the
western
trip
and
stay
here
with
us
penny
cried
eagerly
no
i
am
thinking
of
going
to
a
larger
city
and
taking
an
apartment
with
my
money
invested
in
eight
per
cent
securities
i
should
have
a
comfortable
little
income
weems
i
heard
dad
say
over
and
over
that
sound
securities
will
not
pay
such
a
high
rate
of
interest
promise
you
wo
invest
your
money
until
you
talked
with
him
you
always
asking
me
to
promise
something
or
other
the
housekeeper
sighed
this
time
i
shall
use
my
own
judgment
realizing
that
further
argument
was
only
a
waste
of
breath
penny
wandered
outside
to
await
her
father
when
he
came
they
sat
together
on
the
front
porch
steps
discussing
the
situation
i
drop
a
word
of
advice
to
weems
at
the
first
opportunity
offered
parker
if
she
is
in
the
mood
you
describe
it
would
not
be
wise
to
bring
up
the
subject
tonight
she
merely
would
resent
my
interference
what
worries
me
is
that
i
am
afraid
she
may
have
told
al
gepper
where
the
money
is
kept
tomorrow
i
urge
her
again
to
deposit
it
in
a
bank
we
do
our
best
to
protect
her
from
these
sharpers
the
publisher
had
been
very
much
interested
in
penny
account
of
the
séance
however
he
was
unable
to
explain
how
the
various
tricks
had
been
accomplished
dad
penny
said
thoughtfully
you
do
suppose
there
any
chance
it
was
trickery
certainly
not
i
hope
you
not
falling
under
this
fellow
spell
no
but
it
gave
me
a
real
shock
when
i
saw
cousin
david
face
materialize
on
the
canvas
it
was
the
absolute
image
of
him
or
rather
of
a
picture
weems
once
showed
me
a
startled
expression
came
over
penny
face
without
explanation
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
ran
to
the
kitchen
weems
she
cried
did
you
ever
get
it
back
your
picture
what
picture
penny
the
housekeeper
scarcely
glanced
up
as
she
vigorously
scrubbed
carrots
i
mean
the
one
of
cousin
david
you
allowed
a
photographer
to
take
it
for
enlargement
it
has
been
returned
weems
admitted
i
ca
imagine
why
the
work
takes
so
long
i
think
i
can
announced
penny
but
you
never
would
believe
me
if
i
told
you
so
i
wo
racing
to
the
porch
she
revealed
to
her
father
what
she
thought
had
occurred
it
was
her
theory
that
the
agent
who
had
called
at
the
parker
home
days
earlier
had
in
actuality
been
one
of
al
gepper
assistants
do
you
see
dad
she
cried
the
man
obtained
a
picture
of
cousin
david
and
probably
turned
it
over
to
the
medium
her
face
fell
slightly
of
course
that
still
does
explain
how
the
painting
slowly
materialized
nor
does
it
explain
the
ghost
or
the
banjo
penny
could
gepper
have
painted
the
picture
himself
in
the
darkness
there
was
time
dad
besides
he
held
a
flashlight
on
the
painting
no
human
hand
touched
it
you
say
too
that
the
banjo
was
high
overhead
when
it
played
that
right
dad
gepper
could
have
reached
the
strings
the
instrument
floated
free
in
the
air
sounds
fantastic
believe
me
it
was
dad
it
no
wonder
gepper
is
gaining
such
influence
over
weems
he
as
slick
as
a
greased
fox
i
have
jerry
go
to
the
house
and
try
to
learn
how
the
fellow
operates
declared
parker
we
ca
break
the
story
until
we
have
absolute
evidence
that
gepper
has
obtained
money
under
false
pretenses
the
next
day
penny
remained
close
at
home
weems
still
treated
her
somewhat
distantly
leaving
the
house
immediately
after
lunch
and
declining
to
explain
where
she
was
going
penny
was
quite
certain
that
her
destination
was
the
hodges
cottage
guess
i
run
over
and
see
louise
she
thought
restlessly
nothing
to
do
here
before
she
could
leave
the
house
the
doorbell
rang
a
man
of
perhaps
thirty
well
dressed
with
a
leather
briefcase
tucked
under
his
arm
stood
on
the
front
porch
he
bowed
politely
to
penny
this
is
where
weems
resides
i
believe
yes
but
she
is
here
now
when
will
she
be
home
i
ca
say
replied
penny
are
you
an
agent
the
man
appearance
displeased
her
although
she
could
not
have
said
exactly
why
his
smile
was
too
ingratiating
his
eyes
calculating
and
hard
my
name
is
bierkamp
he
explained
i
represent
the
harold
bierkamp
investment
company
penny
stiffened
she
glared
at
the
agent
you
mean
you
represent
the
al
gepper
spookus
company
she
said
in
a
cutting
voice
well
weems
does
want
any
of
your
wonderful
eight
per
cent
stocks
she
not
see
you
so
do
come
here
again
and
who
are
you
to
speak
for
her
the
man
retorted
if
you
come
here
again
i
call
the
police
penny
threatened
now
get
out
without
another
word
the
man
retreated
down
the
street
penny
watched
until
he
turned
a
corner
and
was
lost
to
view
she
was
a
trifle
worried
as
to
what
she
had
done
if
weems
learns
about
this
she
never
forgive
me
she
thought
uneasily
but
he
was
a
crook
sent
by
al
gepper
i
know
it
wandering
upstairs
she
entered
the
bathroom
intending
to
wash
before
going
to
louise
home
on
the
tiled
floor
lay
a
velvet
ribbon
with
a
key
attached
at
once
penny
realized
that
weems
had
left
it
there
inadvertently
it
the
key
to
her
desk
she
reflected
picking
it
up
and
she
insists
that
her
money
is
kept
in
a
safe
place
i
have
a
notion
to
play
a
joke
on
her
the
longer
penny
considered
the
idea
the
more
it
pleased
her
jubilantly
she
set
forth
for
the
sidell
home
taking
louise
into
her
confidence
she
visited
a
novelty
shop
and
purchased
a
supply
of
fake
money
returning
home
she
then
unlocked
the
drawer
of
weems
desk
and
removing
the
six
thousand
dollars
replaced
it
with
neat
stacks
of
imitation
bills
louise
watched
her
with
misgiving
penny
this
joke
of
yours
is
likely
to
strike
weems
as
very
funny
she
warned
you
always
doing
things
which
get
you
into
trouble
this
is
in
a
good
cause
lou
i
am
protecting
weems
from
her
own
folly
what
will
you
do
with
the
money
deposit
it
in
a
bank
you
are
taking
matters
into
your
hands
with
a
vengeance
suppose
robbed
on
the
way
downtown
that
would
complicate
my
life
upon
second
thought
i
send
for
an
armored
truck
to
louise
amazement
penny
actually
carried
through
her
plan
a
heavily
guarded
express
truck
presently
drew
up
before
the
parker
residence
and
weems
money
was
turned
over
to
the
two
armed
men
who
promised
that
it
would
be
delivered
safely
to
the
first
national
bank
there
that
a
load
off
my
mind
said
penny
just
let
al
gepper
try
to
steal
weems
money
now
louise
shook
her
head
sadly
you
may
be
accused
of
stealing
yourself
i
would
be
in
your
slippers
when
weems
learns
about
this
oh
i
be
able
to
explain
laughed
penny
the
joke
she
had
played
did
not
seem
quite
so
funny
an
hour
later
weems
returned
home
and
without
comment
recovered
the
key
which
had
been
replaced
on
the
lavatory
floor
she
did
not
open
her
desk
or
mention
the
money
at
dinner
penny
was
so
subdued
that
the
housekeeper
inquired
if
she
were
not
yet
the
girl
answered
i
just
thinking
about
the
future
so
depressing
perhaps
a
picture
show
would
cheer
us
all
proposed
parker
weems
displayed
interest
and
penny
without
enthusiasm
agreed
to
go
eight
found
them
at
the
avalon
a
neighborhood
theatre
the
show
was
not
to
penny
liking
although
her
father
and
the
housekeeper
seemed
to
enjoy
it
she
squirmed
restlessly
and
finally
whispered
to
her
father
that
she
was
returning
home
in
truth
as
penny
well
knew
she
was
suffering
from
an
acute
case
of
conscience
now
that
it
was
too
late
she
regretted
having
meddled
with
weems
money
gloomily
she
walked
home
alone
as
she
entered
she
heard
the
telephone
ringing
but
before
she
could
answer
the
party
hung
up
with
a
sigh
penny
locked
the
front
door
again
switched
out
the
lights
and
went
to
bed
for
a
long
while
she
lay
staring
at
a
patch
of
moonlight
on
the
bedroom
carpet
although
she
felt
tired
she
could
not
sleep
it
just
as
louise
said
she
reflected
i
always
getting
myself
into
hot
water
and
for
no
good
reason
either
her
morose
thoughts
were
interrupted
as
a
hard
object
thudded
against
a
nearby
wall
penny
sat
up
listening
she
believed
that
the
sound
had
come
from
weems
room
yet
she
knew
she
was
alone
in
the
house
rolling
from
bed
she
groped
for
a
robe
and
without
turning
on
the
lights
tiptoed
down
the
hall
weems
door
stood
open
was
some
intruder
hidden
in
that
room
peering
inside
penny
at
first
noticed
nothing
amiss
then
her
gaze
fastened
on
the
window
sill
plainly
visible
in
the
moonlight
two
iron
hooks
evenly
spaced
had
been
clamped
over
the
ledge
chapter
the
window
as
penny
flattened
herself
against
the
wall
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
man
slowly
rose
into
view
although
his
body
was
plainly
silhouetted
in
the
moonlight
she
could
not
see
his
face
the
intruder
raised
the
sash
making
no
sound
he
hesitated
listening
a
moment
then
dropped
lightly
into
the
bedroom
without
turning
on
a
flashlight
which
he
carried
he
went
directly
to
weems
desk
so
deliberate
was
the
action
that
penny
instantly
decided
the
fellow
had
come
for
a
particular
purpose
and
knew
the
of
the
entire
house
he
means
to
steal
weems
money
she
thought
opening
the
desk
the
man
tried
the
drawer
where
the
inheritance
funds
had
been
hidden
failing
to
unlock
it
with
a
key
he
took
a
tool
from
his
pocket
and
in
a
moment
had
broken
the
lock
removing
the
stack
of
fake
bills
which
penny
had
substituted
he
thrust
them
into
his
coat
taking
no
interest
in
anything
else
in
the
room
he
moved
stealthily
toward
the
window
penny
knew
there
was
no
one
within
calling
distance
and
that
the
man
probably
was
armed
wisdom
dictated
that
she
remain
in
hiding
but
she
was
determined
the
thief
should
not
escape
hoping
to
take
him
by
surprise
she
stalked
forward
a
board
creaked
with
a
muttered
exclamation
the
man
whirled
around
at
the
same
instant
penny
flung
herself
upon
him
diving
low
in
imitation
of
a
football
tackle
the
thief
reeled
but
instead
of
falling
he
recovered
his
balance
and
gave
penny
a
tremendous
shove
which
sent
her
sprawling
backwards
before
she
could
regain
her
feet
he
ran
to
the
window
swinging
himself
over
the
ledge
he
vanished
from
view
by
the
time
penny
reached
the
window
there
was
no
sign
of
the
intruder
he
had
disappeared
as
if
into
thin
air
however
she
knew
that
the
man
must
have
descended
by
means
of
a
ladder
which
he
had
hastily
removed
she
ran
her
hand
over
the
window
ledge
the
iron
hooks
no
longer
were
there
only
the
scars
which
had
been
cut
in
the
wood
this
undoubtedly
was
the
same
fellow
who
broke
into
the
kohl
apartment
she
thought
but
how
did
he
escape
so
quickly
penny
started
for
a
telephone
intending
to
notify
the
police
however
when
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
father
might
not
wish
the
matter
made
public
she
changed
her
mind
and
ran
downstairs
unlocking
the
rear
door
she
glanced
carefully
about
the
yard
there
was
no
one
in
sight
no
movement
behind
any
of
the
shrubbery
he
gone
of
course
she
thought
penny
wore
no
shoes
finding
a
pair
of
old
galoshes
on
the
porch
she
protected
her
feet
with
them
and
hobbled
into
the
yard
the
grass
beneath
weems
window
had
been
trampled
but
at
first
glance
there
was
no
clue
to
indicate
how
the
burglar
had
gained
entrance
to
the
house
obviously
he
used
a
ladder
she
reasoned
but
how
did
he
descend
so
quickly
and
what
became
of
the
ladder
i
know
he
never
had
time
to
carry
away
one
of
the
ordinary
type
a
dark
object
lying
on
the
grass
attracted
penny
attention
picking
it
up
she
carried
it
to
the
porch
and
switched
on
a
light
that
she
might
see
to
better
advantage
in
her
hand
she
held
a
torn
strand
of
black
silk
rope
this
may
be
an
important
clue
she
thought
excitedly
i
know
now
how
the
man
entered
the
house
as
penny
examined
the
piece
of
rope
automobile
headlight
beams
cut
a
path
across
the
yard
the
parker
car
drew
up
on
the
driveway
and
both
weems
and
parker
alighted
dad
come
here
quickly
penny
called
as
he
started
to
open
the
garage
doors
what
wrong
penny
both
the
publisher
and
weems
came
toward
the
porch
we
had
a
burglar
penny
announced
he
broke
into
weems
room
smashing
the
lock
on
the
desk
my
money
the
housekeeper
exclaimed
in
horror
oh
penny
do
tell
me
that
it
gone
he
escaped
with
the
contents
of
the
drawer
weems
gave
a
moan
of
anguish
have
you
called
the
police
she
demanded
when
did
it
happen
tell
me
everything
first
i
set
your
mind
at
rest
penny
replied
your
money
is
safe
oh
i
never
was
so
relieved
in
all
my
born
days
weems
sagged
weakly
into
a
porch
rocker
penny
how
could
you
torture
me
by
letting
me
think
the
money
was
stolen
because
i
have
a
confession
to
make
weems
you
left
the
key
to
your
desk
lying
on
the
bathroom
floor
i
thought
it
might
be
a
good
joke
to
move
the
money
to
another
place
oh
you
darling
blessed
girl
laughed
weems
where
did
you
hide
it
penny
are
you
sure
it
safe
it
should
be
i
had
it
taken
to
the
first
national
bank
and
deposited
in
your
name
the
thief
carried
off
a
package
of
fake
money
rather
were
you
commented
her
father
now
do
you
scold
her
spoke
weems
quickly
i
am
glad
penny
acted
as
she
did
otherwise
i
might
have
lost
my
entire
inheritance
penny
drew
a
deep
breath
i
relieved
you
feel
that
way
about
it
i
wish
i
could
see
the
burglar
face
when
he
discovers
he
stole
worthless
money
both
the
housekeeper
and
parker
pressed
her
with
questions
she
revealed
exactly
what
had
occurred
during
their
absence
showing
them
the
strand
of
black
silk
rope
dad
i
think
this
may
be
a
valuable
clue
she
declared
what
does
it
suggest
to
you
not
much
of
anything
i
am
afraid
you
remember
that
when
the
kohls
were
robbed
the
police
could
figure
out
how
the
burglar
gained
entrance
yes
i
recall
the
story
well
i
believe
the
same
man
committed
both
burglaries
why
do
you
think
so
penny
at
the
kohl
the
police
found
two
marks
on
the
window
ledge
apparently
made
by
iron
hooks
similar
marks
are
on
the
sill
in
weems
room
for
that
matter
i
distinctly
saw
the
iron
pieces
bite
into
the
wood
let
look
at
them
proposed
parker
only
the
marks
are
there
now
dad
the
man
jerked
the
hooks
loose
after
he
descended
they
must
have
been
attached
to
his
ladder
i
thought
you
said
he
had
none
penny
there
was
no
time
for
him
to
have
carried
away
an
ordinary
heavy
ladder
i
think
the
one
he
used
must
have
been
made
of
silk
and
this
is
a
piece
of
it
parker
exclaimed
examining
the
twisted
strand
with
new
interest
your
theory
sounds
plausible
it
would
be
possible
for
a
man
to
scale
a
wall
with
such
a
ladder
he
could
jerk
loose
the
hooks
in
an
instant
too
dad
the
ladder
would
fit
into
a
small
suitcase
or
even
his
pocket
there
one
objection
to
your
theory
penny
how
could
such
a
ladder
be
raised
to
the
window
ledge
it
naturally
would
be
limp
that
part
has
me
puzzled
i
admit
i
never
even
heard
of
a
silken
ladder
said
weems
doubtfully
i
once
saw
one
being
made
declared
penny
with
deliberate
emphasis
at
a
japanese
shop
on
dorr
street
that
right
you
spoke
of
it
exclaimed
her
father
penny
you
may
have
something
i
think
so
dad
this
strand
of
twisted
silk
may
lead
straight
to
curio
shop
and
from
there
penny
hesitated
glancing
at
weems
she
knew
that
the
housekeeper
might
take
offense
but
she
answered
quietly
my
guess
would
be
to
al
gepper
dad
who
but
he
or
an
accomplice
could
have
known
where
the
money
was
hidden
chapter
curio
as
penny
had
anticipated
weems
indignantly
declared
that
she
did
not
believe
gepper
could
have
had
any
connection
with
the
attempted
robbery
yet
even
as
she
made
the
assertion
a
startled
expression
came
over
her
face
think
back
weems
urged
parker
how
many
persons
knew
where
you
had
secreted
the
money
i
told
mrs
hodges
and
al
gepper
penny
probed
well
the
housekeeper
looked
ill
at
ease
he
may
have
heard
me
talking
with
hodges
i
remember
he
passed
through
the
hall
while
we
were
together
what
day
was
that
inquired
penny
yesterday
after
the
séance
but
i
ca
believe
that
gepper
would
try
to
steal
the
money
i
just
ca
from
what
penny
has
told
me
of
the
man
i
should
judge
that
he
is
a
schemer
contributed
parker
you
know
the
has
started
a
vigorous
campaign
directed
against
such
mediums
as
al
gepper
but
he
told
me
such
remarkable
things
about
cousin
david
protested
weems
facts
which
could
be
faked
oh
gepper
does
make
many
false
moves
acknowledged
penny
he
a
smooth
worker
all
the
same
he
a
fake
how
could
he
have
faked
cousin
david
message
you
forget
we
actually
saw
the
picture
of
my
relative
painted
without
the
aid
of
a
human
hand
did
the
picture
closely
resemble
your
cousin
inquired
parker
oh
yes
indeed
it
looked
exactly
as
i
saw
him
many
years
ago
is
that
rather
odd
demanded
penny
one
would
expect
cousin
david
to
age
a
little
penny
believes
that
a
photographer
agent
who
came
here
a
few
days
ago
was
sent
by
gepper
to
obtain
a
picture
of
your
relative
explained
parker
did
the
man
ask
you
many
questions
about
your
cousin
well
yes
he
did
weems
admitted
unwillingly
i
made
a
mistake
giving
him
the
photograph
it
seems
fairly
evident
that
the
picture
was
used
by
gepper
parker
commented
whether
he
plotted
to
steal
your
money
remains
to
be
proven
penny
you
saw
the
man
plainly
no
i
did
dad
not
his
face
he
was
about
the
same
build
as
gepper
that
not
much
to
go
on
from
the
first
gepper
was
determined
to
get
weems
money
dad
he
sent
a
man
here
who
pretended
to
be
from
the
bierkamp
investment
company
you
did
tell
me
that
said
weems
well
no
i
did
i
was
afraid
you
would
invest
your
money
with
him
so
i
drove
the
man
away
he
must
have
been
gepper
accomplice
failing
to
acquire
the
money
by
that
means
he
plotted
the
burglary
surely
you
do
agree
with
penny
the
housekeeper
asked
parker
unhappily
in
general
i
am
afraid
i
do
gepper
is
an
undesirable
character
and
i
should
like
nothing
better
than
to
send
him
to
jail
come
upstairs
weems
urged
penny
i
show
you
the
desk
both
the
housekeeper
and
parker
followed
her
to
the
second
floor
an
examination
of
the
bedroom
disclosed
no
additional
clues
but
after
studying
the
marks
on
the
window
ledge
the
publisher
favored
theory
that
a
silk
ladder
had
been
utilized
it
was
unwise
of
me
to
keep
my
money
here
weems
remarked
in
a
crestfallen
tone
i
i
been
silly
about
everything
i
guess
penny
gave
her
a
quick
hug
no
you
have
anyone
might
have
been
taken
in
by
al
gepper
i
shall
never
attend
another
of
his
séances
i
urge
hodges
to
turn
him
from
her
house
weems
are
you
willing
to
help
get
evidence
against
him
asked
parker
abruptly
why
yes
if
i
can
then
go
to
the
hodges
exactly
as
you
have
in
the
past
instructed
the
publisher
penny
has
been
warned
by
gepper
not
to
attend
any
of
the
séances
but
you
still
be
welcome
learn
everything
you
can
and
report
to
me
i
be
glad
to
do
it
mr
parker
do
allow
him
to
guess
that
you
have
become
suspicious
above
all
never
withdraw
your
money
from
the
bank
at
his
suggestion
you
may
be
sure
i
wo
this
has
taught
me
a
bitter
lesson
have
you
an
assignment
for
me
dad
inquired
penny
how
about
kano
curio
shop
early
tomorrow
i
send
jerry
there
to
question
the
old
jap
will
you
notify
the
police
not
for
the
present
if
we
can
crack
this
story
i
like
to
get
it
ahead
of
the
i
wish
you
would
send
me
to
kano
instead
of
jerry
dorr
street
is
no
place
for
you
penny
parker
replied
dismissing
the
matter
shall
we
get
to
bed
now
it
nearly
midnight
after
the
doors
had
been
locked
once
more
penny
went
to
her
room
but
she
did
not
immediately
fall
asleep
instead
she
kept
mulling
over
the
events
of
the
night
the
more
she
thought
about
it
the
more
firmly
she
became
convinced
that
both
the
kohl
home
and
her
own
had
been
entered
by
the
same
person
the
telephone
was
ringing
when
i
came
from
the
movie
she
recalled
now
i
wonder
who
called
it
may
have
been
a
trick
of
the
thief
to
learn
if
anyone
were
in
the
house
when
no
one
answered
the
assumption
would
be
that
the
coast
was
clear
penny
felt
rather
well
satisfied
with
the
way
matters
had
developed
in
one
bold
stroke
she
had
saved
weems
inheritance
convinced
the
housekeeper
that
al
gepper
was
not
to
be
trusted
and
had
made
definite
progress
in
gaining
evidence
to
be
used
in
her
father
campaign
against
the
charlatan
invaders
of
riverview
yet
it
annoyed
her
that
the
story
now
that
it
had
reached
an
active
stage
was
to
be
turned
over
to
jerry
i
have
a
notion
to
visit
the
kano
curio
shop
ahead
of
him
she
thought
that
exactly
what
i
do
having
made
up
her
mind
she
rolled
over
and
promptly
fell
asleep
in
the
morning
penny
ate
breakfast
and
wiped
the
dishes
with
a
speed
which
astonished
weems
shortly
after
her
father
left
for
the
office
she
backed
her
own
maroon
car
from
the
garage
and
offering
only
a
vague
explanation
departed
for
kano
curio
shop
dorr
street
was
quite
deserted
at
such
an
early
hour
and
the
japanese
shop
owner
had
just
unlocked
his
doors
he
was
sweeping
the
floor
as
penny
boldly
entered
good
morning
kano
she
greeted
him
you
remember
me
i
believe
kano
bowed
regarding
her
warily
yes
he
replied
you
are
the
young
lady
whose
curiosity
is
very
large
penny
smiled
you
are
right
kano
it
is
very
large
especially
about
a
certain
silken
ladder
kano
frowned
as
he
leaned
on
his
broom
i
am
very
sorry
he
said
i
am
a
merchant
not
one
who
answers
what
you
call
the
penny
understood
that
the
japanese
never
would
tell
her
what
she
wished
to
know
save
under
compulsion
she
decided
to
adopt
firm
tactics
kano
she
said
my
father
is
the
owner
of
the
and
he
intends
to
expose
certain
crooks
who
have
been
robbing
wealthy
persons
such
as
the
kohls
you
read
in
the
paper
that
their
home
was
entered
yes
i
read
the
japanese
shrugged
my
own
theory
is
that
the
thief
gained
entrance
by
means
of
a
silk
ladder
penny
declared
ladder
made
in
this
shop
the
shopkeeper
eyes
narrowed
i
know
nothing
he
replied
nothing
you
go
now
please
if
i
go
said
penny
i
return
with
the
police
you
would
not
like
that
i
take
it
her
voice
was
crisp
and
full
of
menace
kano
lost
some
of
his
poise
no
he
answered
sharply
i
am
an
honest
man
and
want
no
sad
trouble
with
the
police
chancing
to
glance
toward
the
street
penny
observed
jerry
livingston
standing
on
the
opposite
corner
he
was
gazing
thoughtfully
toward
the
curio
shop
and
she
knew
that
he
must
have
been
sent
by
her
father
to
interview
kano
inspired
she
turned
again
to
the
old
japanese
you
see
that
young
man
yonder
she
asked
indicating
jerry
i
have
but
to
summon
him
and
he
come
here
detective
demanded
kano
peering
anxiously
through
the
window
do
not
call
him
i
am
an
honest
man
i
will
answer
your
questions
then
tell
me
about
the
silken
ladder
i
know
little
the
shopkeeper
insisted
i
made
the
rope
for
a
man
who
said
this
or
we
will
burn
your
shop
down
mr
kano
so
i
made
the
ladder
and
he
paid
me
well
for
fashioning
it
and
what
was
the
man
name
his
name
i
do
not
know
but
his
eyes
were
small
and
evil
his
skin
was
dark
his
nose
crooked
kano
ceased
speaking
with
an
abruptness
which
caused
penny
to
glance
toward
the
door
her
first
thought
was
that
jerry
had
entered
instead
a
strange
young
man
stood
there
regarding
her
suspiciously
as
she
stared
at
him
he
quickly
retreated
but
not
before
she
had
caught
a
fleeting
impression
of
a
face
which
matched
kano
description
with
startling
accuracy
was
he
the
one
she
demanded
as
the
door
slammed
the
man
for
whom
you
made
the
ladder
no
no
denied
the
japanese
his
words
failed
to
convince
penny
darting
to
the
door
she
saw
that
the
young
man
already
was
far
down
the
street
walking
rapidly
he
is
the
one
she
thought
i
follow
him
wait
called
the
japanese
as
she
started
away
i
have
more
to
tell
you
it
was
a
ruse
to
detain
her
penny
knew
pushing
past
the
shopkeeper
who
sought
to
bar
the
exit
she
reached
the
street
and
ran
toward
jerry
livingston
why
penny
he
exclaimed
in
surprise
what
are
you
doing
in
this
part
of
town
never
mind
that
she
answered
hastily
if
you
after
a
story
come
along
with
me
we
trailing
the
man
who
just
left
kano
shop
chapter
bell
jerry
fell
into
step
with
penny
as
they
walked
along
she
told
him
of
her
conversation
with
kano
i
believe
this
man
we
following
is
the
same
one
who
entered
our
house
last
night
she
declared
he
the
same
build
as
the
fellow
i
grabbed
besides
he
fits
kano
description
of
the
person
who
bought
the
silken
ladder
here
hoping
you
right
replied
jerry
if
i
muff
this
assignment
i
may
wake
up
looking
for
another
job
fearing
that
the
man
ahead
would
discover
he
was
being
followed
jerry
and
penny
dropped
farther
and
farther
behind
presently
they
saw
him
enter
a
pawnshop
i
know
that
place
commented
jerry
it
run
by
spike
weiser
a
notorious
he
buys
stolen
goods
and
gets
rid
of
it
at
a
profit
has
a
swell
home
on
clarmont
drive
why
do
the
police
arrest
him
oh
they
watch
the
place
but
spike
is
too
smart
to
be
caught
he
has
a
system
for
handling
goods
i
venture
some
of
the
kohl
loot
was
sold
through
him
jerry
it
would
surprise
me
but
if
the
police
search
the
place
they
find
a
thing
loitering
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
penny
and
the
reporter
kept
close
watch
of
the
pawnbroker
shop
thirty
minutes
elapsed
the
man
whom
they
had
trailed
did
not
reappear
he
must
have
slipped
out
the
back
door
jerry
remarked
probably
knew
he
was
being
watched
i
beginning
to
think
so
myself
jerry
glanced
at
his
watch
i
ca
take
any
more
time
he
said
have
to
get
back
to
the
office
i
watch
a
few
minutes
longer
answered
penny
if
anything
develops
i
try
to
telephone
jerry
walked
hurriedly
away
scarcely
had
he
disappeared
when
the
door
of
the
pawnshop
opened
and
the
young
man
who
had
entered
a
half
hour
earlier
appeared
penny
hastily
moved
back
into
the
vestibule
of
an
office
building
without
observing
her
the
stranger
crossed
the
street
and
walked
briskly
toward
an
intersecting
boulevard
there
was
no
opportunity
for
penny
to
telephone
the
office
following
she
was
hard
pressed
to
keep
the
man
within
view
not
until
they
reached
the
entrance
of
butternut
lane
did
it
dawn
upon
her
that
the
celestial
temple
might
be
their
destination
then
indeed
her
pulse
stepped
up
a
pace
it
exactly
as
i
guessed
she
thought
triumphantly
he
connected
with
al
gepper
and
the
other
mediums
not
wishing
to
attract
attention
in
the
deserted
lane
penny
took
a
short
cut
through
the
cemetery
emerging
at
the
rear
of
the
celestial
temple
there
was
no
door
on
that
side
of
the
building
but
a
window
had
been
left
raised
placed
beneath
it
as
if
for
her
particular
convenience
was
a
large
rock
penny
stood
on
it
peering
into
the
temple
the
room
was
unoccupied
however
as
she
waited
the
same
man
she
had
trailed
quietly
let
himself
in
through
the
front
entrance
using
a
key
he
glanced
about
and
called
in
a
low
voice
pete
pete
anyone
here
there
was
no
answer
which
seemed
to
please
the
young
man
he
moved
quickly
down
the
aisle
crossed
the
platform
to
a
door
which
opened
into
the
bell
tower
kneeling
he
began
to
fit
keys
into
the
lock
seeking
one
which
would
serve
as
penny
watched
the
young
man
suddenly
straightened
apparently
he
had
heard
footsteps
in
the
vestibule
for
he
moved
away
from
the
bell
tower
door
a
woman
with
dyed
hair
and
a
skin
of
unusual
pallor
entered
the
temple
she
stopped
short
as
she
saw
the
young
man
you
here
slippery
she
commented
gazing
at
him
with
distrust
where
pete
hello
sade
i
was
wonderin
about
pete
myself
just
got
here
a
minute
ago
the
woman
gaze
fastened
upon
the
key
which
had
been
left
in
the
bell
tower
door
say
what
coming
off
here
she
demanded
you
were
trying
to
get
inside
now
do
ruffle
your
feathers
sade
the
man
said
soothingly
i
was
only
testing
the
door
to
make
sure
it
was
locked
i
bet
you
were
aiming
to
break
in
slippery
they
sure
named
you
right
why
you
your
own
mother
oh
quiet
down
the
man
retorted
angrily
i
only
came
here
to
make
sure
pete
was
on
the
job
the
lazy
loafer
has
skipped
out
and
left
the
place
unguarded
the
woman
deliberately
seated
herself
in
a
chair
beside
the
bell
tower
door
i
parking
here
until
pete
shows
up
she
announced
maybe
you
on
the
square
slippery
but
i
do
trust
you
thanks
for
your
flattering
opinion
the
man
responded
mockingly
you
give
me
a
pain
sade
i
do
all
the
dangerous
work
and
what
do
i
get
a
measly
ten
per
cent
plus
what
you
stick
in
your
pocket
when
you
on
a
job
the
woman
shot
back
with
rising
anger
you
been
doing
pretty
well
for
yourself
slippery
you
and
al
but
the
boys
are
getting
wise
from
now
on
it
may
not
be
so
easy
better
play
fair
with
the
rest
of
us
or
else
you
always
did
have
a
wagging
tongue
the
man
retorted
always
trying
to
stir
up
trouble
do
you
realize
we
got
to
work
together
or
be
jailed
separately
our
ranks
must
be
united
gettin
sort
of
jittery
ai
you
maybe
you
have
been
reading
those
editorials
in
the
sure
i
read
them
and
get
a
big
laugh
this
guy
parker
has
to
blow
off
steam
nothing
will
come
of
it
the
police
have
visited
this
place
once
already
and
what
did
they
find
nothing
that
no
guarantee
they
wo
try
again
i
tell
you
this
town
is
getting
too
hot
for
comfort
figurin
on
blowing
the
woman
inquired
watching
him
shrewdly
slippery
laughter
had
an
unpleasant
edge
you
sure
do
get
ideas
sade
do
start
peddling
that
line
of
talk
understand
i
hear
suddenly
losing
his
temper
the
man
strode
nearer
seizing
her
arm
just
start
something
and
see
where
you
wake
up
he
said
harshly
one
word
to
pete
or
any
of
the
boys
and
you
wo
do
any
more
pretty
fortune
telling
the
woman
jerked
her
arm
free
gazing
at
the
man
in
sullen
silence
nor
did
she
speak
as
he
left
the
temple
slamming
the
door
behind
him
chapter
penny
debated
whether
or
not
to
follow
slippery
deciding
that
she
should
try
to
keep
him
within
sight
she
abandoned
her
post
beneath
the
window
and
ran
to
the
front
of
the
building
already
the
young
man
was
far
down
the
lane
walking
rapidly
before
penny
could
overtake
him
he
hailed
a
taxi
and
drove
away
by
the
time
she
obtained
another
cab
pursuit
was
futile
to
the
office
penny
ordered
the
driver
although
slippery
had
eluded
her
she
did
not
feel
that
her
work
had
been
wasted
she
believed
that
her
father
would
be
very
much
interested
in
a
report
of
her
findings
it
evident
that
slippery
is
connected
with
al
gepper
and
various
mediums
of
the
celestial
temple
she
reflected
i
am
sure
too
that
he
the
one
who
broke
into
our
house
but
to
prove
it
may
not
be
so
easy
penny
had
not
fully
understood
the
conversation
which
she
had
overheard
between
slippery
and
sade
that
they
distrusted
each
other
was
evident
but
why
had
the
woman
feared
slippery
might
break
into
the
bell
tower
during
the
guard
absence
something
of
great
value
to
the
organization
must
be
kept
there
she
reasoned
but
what
can
it
be
penny
believed
that
her
father
would
not
delay
in
requesting
police
to
search
the
bell
tower
of
the
celestial
temple
however
a
disappointment
awaited
her
upon
arriving
at
the
newspaper
office
dewitt
stopped
her
as
she
went
past
his
desk
do
go
in
there
he
said
jerking
his
thumb
toward
private
room
why
not
asked
penny
in
surprise
is
dad
having
a
conference
dewitt
nodded
as
he
composed
a
two
column
headline
with
p
henley
the
sugar
daddy
our
biggest
advertiser
he
threatening
to
go
over
to
the
why
that
serious
it
is
if
he
quits
the
the
old
man
parker
dewitt
corrected
hastily
has
been
trying
to
soften
him
up
for
the
past
two
hours
whatever
you
do
do
bust
in
there
now
i
wo
dewitt
but
i
did
wish
to
see
dad
anything
i
can
do
for
you
penny
hesitated
well
i
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
something
i
learned
today
at
the
celestial
temple
oh
yes
nodded
the
city
editor
his
attention
on
a
sheet
of
copy
parker
is
handling
the
campaign
personally
sorry
i
ca
be
of
service
rather
startled
by
dewitt
unusual
politeness
penny
glanced
hopefully
toward
jerry
livingston
desk
it
was
littered
with
papers
but
quite
deserted
with
a
sigh
she
left
the
building
and
walked
to
dorr
street
where
she
had
left
her
maroon
car
upon
reaching
home
she
found
that
weems
was
not
there
and
she
had
forgotten
her
own
key
for
a
time
she
sat
disconsolately
on
the
front
porch
then
she
decided
to
go
to
the
hudell
garage
where
leaping
lena
had
been
left
for
repairs
three
days
earlier
the
car
was
ready
and
with
it
a
bill
for
eight
dollars
and
cents
i
have
to
give
you
a
dollar
on
account
and
pay
the
remainder
next
week
said
penny
or
would
you
rather
keep
the
car
as
a
deposit
give
me
the
dollar
said
the
garage
man
hastily
penny
became
even
more
depressed
as
she
drove
the
automobile
home
not
for
the
world
would
she
openly
admit
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
in
repurchasing
lena
secretly
she
acknowledged
that
two
cars
were
an
unbearable
financial
drain
upon
slender
resources
turning
into
her
own
street
penny
saw
weems
walking
toward
home
and
stopped
for
her
i
just
come
from
the
hodges
the
housekeeper
commented
climbing
into
the
car
you
have
inquired
penny
eagerly
did
you
learn
anything
no
i
did
gepper
seemed
very
unwilling
to
conduct
another
séance
he
acted
so
different
this
time
almost
as
if
he
bore
me
a
personal
grudge
he
probably
provoked
because
your
inheritance
eluded
him
he
did
tell
hodges
that
he
doubted
i
had
any
money
weems
responded
what
happened
at
the
séance
why
nothing
the
table
moved
and
we
heard
a
few
raps
that
was
all
no
message
from
cousin
david
not
a
word
or
a
sign
gepper
seemed
very
indifferent
about
it
all
he
said
he
could
give
me
another
appointment
unless
i
paid
for
it
what
do
you
think
about
him
now
penny
asked
curiously
do
you
agree
with
dad
and
me
that
he
was
after
your
money
yes
i
was
very
silly
the
housekeeper
acknowledged
hodges
has
begun
to
lose
faith
in
him
too
she
says
he
been
bringing
all
sorts
of
folks
to
her
place
when
she
told
him
she
did
care
to
have
the
house
with
strangers
he
became
very
unpleasant
you
mean
he
threatened
her
in
a
mild
way
he
told
her
that
he
would
stay
as
long
as
he
pleased
and
she
could
do
nothing
about
it
hodges
is
afraid
to
go
to
the
police
for
fear
she
be
arrested
with
mr
gepper
i
wonder
if
he
ever
has
charged
for
his
séances
penny
said
thoughtfully
i
am
sure
he
has
penny
of
course
i
have
no
proof
weems
you
must
go
there
again
this
afternoon
penny
urged
insist
upon
another
séance
and
pay
him
for
it
then
you
be
able
to
testify
as
a
witness
against
him
but
i
do
wish
to
go
into
court
the
housekeeper
protested
besides
gepper
wo
be
at
the
cottage
this
afternoon
where
is
he
going
penny
questioned
alertly
i
do
know
i
heard
him
tell
hodges
he
would
be
gone
this
afternoon
but
would
return
for
an
eight
séance
why
that
fine
wonderful
chuckled
penny
weems
gazed
at
the
girl
with
sudden
suspicion
now
what
have
you
thought
up
she
demanded
nothing
alarming
grinned
penny
i
merely
plan
to
visit
studio
during
his
absence
who
knows
i
may
yet
master
a
few
of
the
finer
points
of
chapter
the
despite
weems
protests
penny
remained
firm
in
her
decision
to
investigate
gepper
studio
she
ate
a
belatedly
prepared
lunch
and
did
not
reach
the
hodges
cottage
until
nearly
four
having
driven
there
in
lena
the
doors
were
closed
and
penny
knocked
several
times
without
receiving
a
response
everyone
must
have
gone
away
she
thought
oh
dear
now
what
shall
i
do
penny
reasoned
that
it
was
of
vital
importance
for
her
to
inspect
al
gepper
room
during
his
absence
she
might
never
have
another
opportunity
yet
she
hesitated
to
enter
the
house
while
the
hodges
were
away
even
though
she
felt
certain
the
seamstress
would
not
mind
walking
to
the
rear
penny
noticed
that
the
porch
screen
had
been
left
unfastened
entering
the
kitchen
she
called
hodges
name
but
received
no
answer
if
i
wait
for
her
to
come
home
it
may
be
too
late
decided
penny
this
is
an
emergency
her
mind
made
up
she
took
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
to
al
gepper
room
her
knock
went
unanswered
satisfied
that
he
was
not
there
she
tried
the
door
and
found
it
unlocked
penny
raised
a
blind
to
flood
light
into
the
darkened
room
save
that
a
film
of
dust
covered
the
furniture
everything
was
approximately
the
same
as
she
had
last
seen
it
her
gaze
fell
upon
two
suitcases
which
had
been
pushed
beneath
the
bed
the
first
contained
only
miscellaneous
clothing
the
second
merited
a
more
careful
inspection
almost
at
once
penny
came
upon
an
old
faded
picture
the
one
of
cousin
david
which
weems
had
given
to
the
photographer
agent
so
that
was
how
it
was
done
she
thought
al
gepper
sent
one
of
his
confederates
to
see
weems
and
obtain
information
about
her
cousin
the
painting
which
appeared
so
miraculously
during
the
séance
was
merely
a
copy
of
this
even
so
how
was
it
painted
so
quickly
forgetting
the
picture
for
a
moment
penny
picked
up
several
newspaper
clippings
which
were
fastened
together
with
a
rubber
band
all
had
been
taken
from
the
obituary
column
and
concerned
the
death
of
riverview
persons
al
gepper
and
his
pals
are
ghouls
penny
told
herself
they
prey
upon
the
relatives
of
persons
who
have
died
realizing
that
at
such
a
time
it
will
be
much
easier
to
interest
them
in
trying
to
communicate
with
the
departed
lifting
a
tray
from
the
suitcase
her
attention
focused
upon
a
small
red
booklet
as
she
turned
rapidly
through
it
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
fell
to
the
floor
examining
it
penny
saw
a
long
list
of
names
together
with
pertinent
information
about
each
person
not
only
was
the
address
and
financial
standing
of
the
individual
given
but
the
deceased
relatives
in
each
family
and
other
facts
of
a
personal
nature
the
list
had
been
mimeographed
this
must
be
a
list
thought
penny
no
wonder
it
easy
for
a
medium
to
find
victims
and
tell
them
astonishing
facts
thrusting
the
paper
into
her
pocket
she
turned
her
attention
to
the
wardrobe
closet
al
gepper
clothes
hung
in
orderly
rows
from
the
hangers
behind
them
half
hidden
from
view
was
a
small
box
pulling
it
to
the
window
penny
examined
the
contents
there
were
many
bottles
filled
with
chemicals
the
names
of
which
were
unfamiliar
she
noted
a
bottle
of
varnish
another
of
zinc
white
and
some
photographic
paper
in
a
sealed
envelope
a
glance
satisfying
her
she
replaced
the
box
and
next
turned
her
attention
to
the
cabinet
behind
the
large
circular
table
here
she
was
richly
rewarded
as
her
gaze
fell
upon
a
banjo
the
same
one
which
played
during
weems
séance
she
thought
we
were
able
to
see
it
in
the
dark
because
it
covered
with
luminous
paint
but
what
made
it
rise
into
the
air
and
how
could
it
play
without
the
aid
of
human
hands
penny
examined
the
instrument
closely
she
chuckled
as
she
discovered
a
tiny
phonograph
with
a
record
built
into
its
back
side
as
she
pressed
a
control
lever
it
began
a
stringed
version
of
down
upon
the
swanee
river
quickly
turning
it
off
she
inspected
other
objects
in
the
cabinet
at
once
she
found
a
rod
which
could
be
extended
to
a
height
of
five
feet
that
how
the
banjo
was
raised
she
reasoned
and
by
use
of
this
rod
it
would
be
easy
to
make
a
ghost
appear
to
float
high
overhead
this
luminous
material
must
have
been
used
penny
picked
up
a
filmy
robe
shaking
out
the
many
folds
while
it
was
clear
to
her
that
al
gepper
had
employed
the
garment
to
materialize
the
spirit
of
cousin
david
she
could
only
guess
how
he
had
made
it
enlarge
from
a
mere
spot
to
a
full
sized
figure
he
must
have
wadded
the
cloth
in
his
hand
and
held
it
above
his
head
she
mused
then
he
could
have
slowly
shaken
it
out
until
it
covered
his
entire
body
thus
the
figure
would
appear
to
grow
in
size
in
one
corner
of
the
cabinet
penny
came
upon
a
luminous
slate
this
was
used
for
cousin
david
message
she
thought
al
probably
had
an
assistant
who
wrote
on
it
and
thrust
it
through
the
curtain
while
many
questions
remained
unanswered
penny
had
obtained
sufficient
evidence
to
indicate
that
al
gepper
was
only
a
clever
trickster
greatly
elated
she
decided
to
hasten
to
the
office
to
report
her
findings
noticing
that
she
had
neglected
to
return
the
two
suitcases
to
their
former
places
penny
pushed
them
under
the
bed
again
as
she
straightened
a
door
slammed
on
the
lower
floor
for
an
instant
she
hoped
that
it
was
hodges
or
her
husband
who
had
come
home
then
she
heard
footsteps
on
the
stairs
and
their
rapidity
warned
her
that
they
could
belong
only
to
a
young
person
frantically
she
gazed
about
the
room
the
cabinet
seemed
to
offer
the
safest
hiding
place
slipping
into
it
she
pulled
the
black
curtain
across
the
opening
chapter
scarcely
had
penny
hidden
herself
when
al
gepper
entered
the
room
with
him
was
the
young
man
known
as
slippery
i
tell
you
al
the
latter
was
saying
this
town
is
getting
too
hot
for
comfort
we
got
to
blow
it
was
that
parker
girl
who
queered
everything
muttered
gepper
how
could
i
know
that
her
father
was
a
newspaper
publisher
he
stirred
up
folks
with
his
editorials
you
never
should
have
let
her
in
here
we
had
a
swell
but
now
we
can
expect
a
raid
any
day
i
tell
you
i
thought
she
was
just
a
kid
a
friend
of
the
hodges
did
learn
until
yesterday
who
she
was
we
got
to
blow
al
sade
threatening
to
make
trouble
too
she
thinks
we
holding
out
on
the
others
we
have
picked
up
a
little
extra
coin
now
and
then
sure
al
but
we
always
been
the
brains
of
the
outfit
we
take
most
of
the
risk
plan
all
the
big
jobs
so
why
should
we
have
more
it
time
we
cut
loose
from
slippery
now
you
talking
but
we
ca
pull
out
until
the
henley
job
comes
off
i
had
a
tip
that
the
house
is
likely
to
be
deserted
tonight
let
make
the
haul
and
then
skip
okay
agreed
gepper
i
have
some
suckers
coming
for
a
séance
at
eight
i
get
rid
of
them
in
quick
time
and
be
waiting
so
long
slippery
a
door
slammed
telling
penny
that
the
man
had
left
she
was
somewhat
stunned
by
what
she
had
overheard
believing
that
the
henley
who
had
been
mentioned
must
be
her
father
chief
advertiser
nervously
she
waited
inside
the
cabinet
wishing
that
she
might
take
her
information
to
the
police
to
her
intense
annoyance
al
gepper
did
not
leave
the
room
even
for
a
moment
instead
he
threw
himself
on
the
bed
and
read
a
tabloid
newspaper
after
an
hour
he
arose
and
began
to
prepare
his
supper
on
an
electric
grill
penny
shifted
from
one
position
to
another
growing
more
impatient
every
time
the
man
came
toward
the
cabinet
her
heart
beat
a
trifle
faster
she
was
quite
sure
the
hodges
had
not
yet
returned
home
and
should
al
gepper
discover
her
he
would
not
treat
her
kindly
the
medium
finished
his
supper
and
stacked
the
dishes
in
the
closet
without
washing
them
then
he
started
to
get
ready
for
the
séance
peeping
from
between
the
cracks
of
the
curtain
penny
saw
him
seat
himself
before
the
easel
with
painstaking
care
he
painted
a
picture
of
a
woman
using
a
photograph
as
a
model
after
a
coating
of
varnish
had
been
applied
he
allowed
it
to
dry
and
afterwards
covered
the
entire
picture
with
zinc
white
the
original
painting
was
entirely
hidden
penny
knew
that
hours
had
elapsed
the
room
gradually
darkened
and
al
gepper
turned
on
the
lights
oh
dear
i
must
get
out
of
here
soon
the
girl
thought
desperately
but
if
i
make
a
break
for
it
he
be
sure
to
see
me
that
will
ruin
all
my
plans
eight
came
al
gepper
put
on
his
coat
combed
his
hair
and
was
alertly
waiting
when
the
doorbell
rang
however
instead
of
descending
the
stairs
he
shouted
an
invitation
for
the
visitors
to
come
up
two
women
in
their
early
forties
were
ushered
into
the
séance
chamber
to
be
followed
almost
immediately
by
an
elderly
man
we
will
start
at
once
if
you
please
said
al
gepper
brusquely
i
have
another
engagement
tonight
however
before
the
séance
is
undertaken
i
must
ask
that
each
of
you
pay
the
required
fee
five
dollars
the
money
was
paid
and
the
three
persons
seated
themselves
at
the
table
gepper
switched
off
the
lights
the
séance
began
in
much
the
same
manner
as
the
one
penny
had
attended
the
medium
called
upon
the
spirit
of
a
woman
named
flora
to
appear
now
concentrate
hard
everyone
he
instructed
flora
where
are
you
can
you
not
show
yourself
that
we
may
know
it
is
truly
your
spirit
which
communicates
with
us
from
the
cabinet
so
close
to
al
gepper
that
she
could
have
touched
his
hand
penny
was
able
to
see
his
every
move
yet
so
swift
was
his
next
action
that
she
barely
discerned
it
taking
a
wet
sponge
from
his
pocket
he
wiped
it
across
the
painting
previously
prepared
the
picture
immediately
became
visible
to
the
audience
as
gepper
focused
his
flashlight
on
the
canvas
that
was
the
way
he
made
weems
picture
appear
thought
penny
the
fellow
must
have
a
great
repertoire
of
tricks
the
séance
had
become
so
interesting
that
she
no
longer
thought
of
escape
nevertheless
she
came
to
a
sudden
realization
of
her
precarious
position
as
she
heard
the
medium
say
that
he
would
next
endeavor
to
persuade
the
spirit
of
flora
to
take
actual
shape
with
a
shock
it
dawned
upon
her
that
in
another
moment
the
man
would
enter
the
cabinet
to
make
use
of
the
luminous
gauze
robe
and
other
paraphernalia
knowing
that
she
could
not
hide
from
him
penny
decided
upon
a
bold
break
for
freedom
dropping
the
ghostly
robe
over
her
face
and
shoulders
she
pulled
aside
the
dark
curtain
and
flitted
into
the
room
her
dramatic
entrance
brought
gasps
of
astonishment
from
the
persons
who
sat
at
the
circular
table
the
medium
as
dumbfounded
as
his
audience
muttered
what
the
dickens
and
pushed
back
his
chair
his
legs
rasping
on
the
floor
penny
did
not
linger
but
darted
past
the
group
and
groped
for
the
door
in
the
darkness
she
could
not
immediately
find
it
her
shining
robe
on
the
other
hand
made
her
an
easy
target
for
al
gepper
angrily
the
medium
strode
across
the
room
seizing
her
arm
she
jerked
away
but
he
grasped
a
fold
of
the
robe
it
tore
and
was
left
behind
at
that
critical
instant
penny
hand
encountered
the
door
she
swung
it
open
and
bounded
down
the
stairway
in
the
séance
chamber
a
light
went
on
then
the
hallway
became
brilliantly
illuminated
but
by
that
time
the
girl
was
in
the
dining
room
she
could
hear
al
gepper
clattering
down
the
steps
intent
upon
capturing
her
penny
was
determined
that
he
should
never
learn
her
identity
letting
herself
out
of
the
house
by
way
of
the
kitchen
door
she
decided
that
if
she
attempted
to
cross
the
yard
the
medium
certainly
would
recognize
her
the
woodpile
offered
a
hiding
place
and
she
crouched
behind
it
scarcely
had
she
secreted
herself
when
al
gepper
ran
into
the
yard
he
glanced
about
carefully
and
circled
the
house
twice
finally
convinced
that
the
ghost
had
escaped
he
came
back
to
the
porch
his
customers
greatly
agitated
by
what
had
occurred
were
demanding
explanations
someone
played
a
prank
gepper
explained
briefly
it
will
be
impossible
to
resume
the
séance
for
the
spirits
are
offended
you
will
leave
please
the
customers
departed
and
the
medium
locked
himself
in
the
house
he
did
not
bother
to
lower
the
upstairs
hall
blind
and
penny
caught
occasional
glimpses
of
him
as
he
moved
to
and
fro
he
packing
to
leave
she
observed
unless
i
act
in
time
he
skip
town
i
must
notify
dad
and
the
police
without
an
instant
delay
chapter
the
the
nearest
drugstore
with
a
public
telephone
was
two
blocks
away
penny
ran
the
distance
and
slipping
into
the
booth
she
dialed
the
office
informed
by
the
building
switchboard
operator
that
neither
her
father
nor
dewitt
was
available
she
inquired
for
jerry
livingston
and
to
her
relief
was
connected
with
him
listen
jerry
this
is
penny
she
began
excitedly
i
have
time
to
explain
but
the
lid
is
blowing
off
the
fake
spiritualist
story
rush
the
police
out
to
the
hodges
cottage
and
demand
al
gepper
arrest
send
another
squad
or
some
private
detectives
to
henley
home
henley
jerry
exclaimed
say
have
you
gone
loco
i
not
making
any
mistakes
penny
replied
tersely
if
you
act
quickly
we
may
prevent
a
robbery
i
on
my
way
there
now
to
warn
henley
oh
yes
try
to
find
dad
or
dewitt
and
warn
them
a
big
story
is
breaking
penny
what
this
all
about
the
reporter
demanded
i
ca
go
to
the
police
unless
i
know
what
i
am
doing
you
must
jerry
i
have
plenty
of
evidence
against
gepper
and
his
crowd
but
unless
you
take
the
police
to
the
hodges
in
the
next
fifteen
minutes
it
will
be
too
late
without
giving
jerry
opportunity
to
delay
her
with
other
questions
penny
hung
up
the
receiver
hastening
to
the
street
she
gazed
frantically
about
for
a
taxi
none
was
to
be
had
i
get
to
the
henley
place
quicker
in
lena
than
by
waiting
for
a
cab
to
come
along
she
thought
the
battered
old
car
had
been
parked
a
short
distance
from
the
cottage
hurrying
there
penny
jumped
into
the
ancient
vehicle
and
started
the
motor
as
usual
it
made
a
loud
clatter
but
she
did
not
suspect
that
the
sound
carried
far
up
the
street
nor
did
she
guess
that
al
gepper
stood
at
the
darkened
window
of
his
room
watching
her
penny
drove
as
fast
as
she
could
to
the
henley
home
in
the
southern
section
of
riverview
lights
blazed
from
the
downstairs
windows
abandoning
her
car
in
the
driveway
she
rang
the
doorbell
after
a
long
wait
a
maid
appeared
is
henley
here
penny
asked
breathlessly
or
henley
most
important
that
i
talk
with
them
at
once
henley
has
been
at
the
seashore
for
a
month
the
maid
replied
in
an
agitated
voice
henley
is
somewhere
downtown
i
been
trying
to
get
him
but
the
telephone
wire
has
been
cut
the
house
has
been
robbed
henley
jewelry
has
been
taken
i
do
know
what
else
when
did
it
happen
penny
asked
it
must
have
been
during
the
last
half
hour
i
went
to
the
corner
store
for
a
book
of
stamps
when
i
came
back
five
minutes
ago
i
discovered
what
had
occurred
i
ought
to
call
the
police
but
i
am
afraid
to
do
it
until
i
talked
with
my
employer
the
police
already
have
been
notified
said
penny
they
be
here
any
minute
but
how
did
you
know
the
maid
began
in
astonishment
penny
had
turned
away
she
was
convinced
that
the
burglary
had
been
committed
by
slippery
perhaps
by
this
time
he
had
fled
town
but
she
did
not
believe
he
would
leave
without
his
pal
al
gepper
climbing
into
the
car
again
penny
debated
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
that
having
accomplished
the
burglary
slippery
would
return
to
the
hodges
cottage
to
meet
the
medium
if
he
does
the
police
should
be
on
hand
to
seize
him
she
thought
at
least
he
and
al
will
be
held
for
questioning
but
there
one
place
i
forgot
to
cover
the
celestial
temple
like
a
flash
came
the
recollection
that
slippery
had
been
deeply
interested
in
something
which
was
guarded
in
the
bell
tower
was
it
not
possible
that
he
might
return
there
before
leaving
riverview
shifting
gears
penny
turned
the
car
and
headed
for
butternut
lane
anxiously
she
glanced
at
the
gasoline
gauge
it
registered
less
than
a
gallon
of
fuel
and
she
had
used
her
last
dime
in
the
telephone
booth
if
i
coast
on
all
the
downgrades
i
should
just
make
it
she
estimated
in
starting
for
the
celestial
temple
penny
was
acting
upon
a
hunch
however
it
disturbed
her
that
the
henley
burglary
had
been
accomplished
and
she
was
afraid
she
might
again
be
wasting
precious
time
now
that
it
was
too
late
she
wondered
if
it
would
not
have
been
wiser
to
remain
at
the
hodges
cottage
until
the
police
arrived
i
only
hope
that
end
of
the
affair
is
bungled
she
thought
never
get
over
it
if
al
and
slippery
both
escape
penny
had
reached
the
entrance
to
butternut
lane
parking
at
the
side
of
the
road
she
continued
afoot
toward
the
celestial
temple
from
a
distance
the
building
appeared
dark
however
as
she
drew
closer
she
could
distinguish
a
dim
light
inside
the
temple
a
stout
man
wearing
a
hat
sat
with
his
chair
tilted
against
the
door
of
the
bell
tower
room
he
must
be
the
guard
thought
penny
probably
the
one
they
call
pete
suddenly
she
paused
retreating
into
a
clump
of
elder
bushes
near
the
walk
from
the
direction
of
the
cemetery
a
figure
emerged
at
first
all
that
penny
could
distinguish
was
a
man
carrying
a
suitcase
as
he
drew
closer
her
pulse
quickened
unmistakably
it
was
slippery
without
passing
the
bushes
where
the
girl
had
taken
refuge
the
man
walked
on
toward
the
temple
presently
he
halted
glancing
carefully
about
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
unobserved
he
shoved
his
suitcase
into
the
tall
weeds
which
lined
the
walk
then
he
moved
to
one
of
the
temple
windows
peering
into
the
gloomy
interior
now
what
thought
penny
watching
alertly
this
should
prove
interesting
slippery
remained
beneath
the
window
a
minute
or
two
instead
of
entering
the
temple
he
presently
returned
to
the
high
weeds
stooping
to
remove
some
object
from
his
suitcase
hiding
it
under
his
coat
he
circled
the
building
and
approached
the
side
adjoining
the
cemetery
thoroughly
mystified
penny
cautiously
followed
taking
care
that
her
body
cast
no
shadow
which
would
attract
slippery
attention
the
man
seemed
deeply
engrossed
in
the
task
he
had
set
for
himself
from
his
coat
he
took
a
collapsible
rod
which
he
extended
to
the
approximate
length
of
a
fish
pole
to
its
end
he
attached
a
trailing
silken
ladder
deftly
the
man
raised
the
ladder
until
two
metal
hooks
bit
into
a
projection
of
the
bell
tower
he
tested
the
ropes
to
make
certain
they
would
bear
his
weight
then
with
the
agility
of
a
cat
mounted
the
silken
rungs
penny
saw
him
disappear
into
the
bell
tower
now
why
did
he
climb
up
there
she
asked
herself
he
must
be
after
something
hidden
in
the
belfry
penny
knew
that
she
was
a
long
distance
from
police
aid
but
it
was
unthinkable
that
slippery
should
be
allowed
to
escape
impulsively
she
moved
from
her
hiding
place
to
the
base
of
the
tower
grasping
the
silken
ladder
she
gave
it
a
quick
jerk
which
dislodged
the
two
iron
hooks
down
it
tumbled
into
her
arms
leaving
the
man
trapped
in
the
turret
he
never
dare
call
for
help
when
he
discovers
what
has
happened
reasoned
penny
if
he
does
the
guard
pete
will
have
something
to
say
rolling
the
ladder
into
a
small
bundle
she
started
across
the
clearing
intending
to
seek
the
nearest
telephone
with
no
thought
of
lurking
danger
she
brushed
past
a
clump
of
bushes
a
hand
reached
out
and
grasped
her
arm
penny
screamed
in
terror
and
tried
to
break
free
the
hand
help
her
in
a
grip
of
steel
as
she
struggled
her
captor
emerged
from
the
shelter
of
leaves
it
was
al
gepper
i
thought
i
might
find
you
here
my
little
one
he
said
grimly
you
have
had
your
fun
now
you
must
pay
and
the
entertainment
shall
be
mine
chapter
prisoner
in
the
penny
tried
to
scream
only
to
have
al
gepper
clamp
his
hand
over
her
mouth
none
of
that
he
said
harshly
behave
yourself
or
you
get
rough
treatment
inside
the
temple
lights
suddenly
were
turned
on
for
the
brief
struggle
had
been
heard
by
pete
the
squat
man
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
building
peering
down
the
lane
who
there
he
demanded
suspiciously
al
gepper
uttered
an
angry
word
beneath
his
breath
it
was
not
to
his
liking
that
pete
should
be
drawn
into
the
affair
however
he
could
not
avoid
detection
it
al
he
called
softly
this
girl
broke
up
my
séance
tonight
and
i
trailed
her
here
she
was
prowling
around
the
bell
tower
as
he
spoke
he
dragged
penny
toward
the
temple
entrance
his
words
convinced
her
that
he
had
not
observed
her
remove
the
silken
ladder
from
the
belfry
wall
nor
was
he
aware
that
slippery
was
a
prisoner
in
the
tower
let
have
a
look
at
her
said
pete
he
flashed
a
light
directly
into
penny
face
she
the
parker
girl
daughter
of
the
publisher
informed
al
yeah
commented
pete
i
saw
her
at
one
of
our
meetings
another
girl
was
with
her
how
much
has
she
learned
enough
to
get
us
all
run
out
of
town
the
question
is
what
shall
we
do
with
her
bring
her
inside
and
we
talk
it
over
said
pete
maybe
we
ought
to
call
a
meeting
no
replied
al
gepper
impatiently
shoving
penny
through
the
doorway
we
can
take
care
of
this
ourselves
the
door
was
locked
from
the
inside
al
pushed
penny
into
a
chair
on
the
front
platform
now
sit
there
he
ordered
one
peep
out
of
you
and
we
tie
you
up
and
tape
your
mouth
understand
oui
said
penny
mockingly
the
two
men
stepped
a
few
paces
away
and
began
to
whisper
together
pete
seemed
to
protest
at
al
proposals
penny
watched
them
uneasily
speculating
upon
their
final
decision
whatever
it
was
she
would
never
be
given
an
opportunity
to
report
to
the
police
until
it
was
too
late
to
apprehend
members
of
the
temple
i
was
stupid
not
to
realize
that
gepper
might
trail
me
she
told
herself
if
only
i
had
used
an
ounce
of
caution
i
might
have
brought
about
the
capture
of
the
entire
gang
not
to
mention
a
grand
scoop
for
dad
paper
penny
slumped
lower
in
her
chair
her
own
predicament
concerned
her
far
less
than
the
knowledge
that
she
had
bungled
a
golden
opportunity
speculatively
her
gaze
shifted
toward
the
bell
tower
room
the
door
was
closed
and
she
believed
that
it
must
be
locked
there
was
no
sound
from
the
belfry
adding
to
her
conviction
that
the
man
imprisoned
there
was
fearful
of
attracting
attention
to
his
plight
al
gepper
and
pete
came
toward
her
with
no
explanation
the
medium
seized
her
arm
and
ordered
her
to
walk
toward
the
exit
where
are
you
taking
me
penny
asked
never
mind
you
find
out
in
good
time
wait
exclaimed
penny
bracing
her
legs
and
refusing
to
be
pushed
if
you
let
me
go
i
tell
you
something
very
much
worth
your
while
deliberately
she
allowed
the
silken
ladder
to
slip
from
beneath
her
coat
the
men
would
not
have
heeded
her
words
but
the
familiar
object
served
its
purpose
where
did
you
get
that
ladder
demanded
al
gepper
so
you
would
like
to
know
what
became
of
your
friend
slippery
responded
penny
evenly
you
be
surprised
when
i
tell
you
that
he
has
you
both
you
lying
accused
gepper
penny
shrugged
and
did
not
speak
what
were
you
going
to
say
gepper
prodded
in
a
moment
out
with
it
how
did
you
get
slippery
ladder
it
fell
into
my
hands
literally
and
figuratively
stalling
for
time
will
get
you
nowhere
snapped
gepper
losing
patience
if
you
know
anything
about
slippery
spill
it
fast
or
not
have
another
chance
your
friend
tried
to
you
declared
penny
she
decided
to
make
a
shrewd
guess
tonight
after
he
robbed
the
henley
home
he
came
here
intending
to
loot
the
bell
tower
why
the
dirty
sneak
exclaimed
pete
were
you
here
on
guard
all
evening
gepper
demanded
turning
to
him
sure
i
was
i
never
set
foot
outside
the
building
slippery
was
here
have
seen
him
since
yesterday
morning
then
the
girl
is
lying
oh
no
the
girl
is
refuted
penny
if
you
care
for
proof
find
it
in
the
tower
proof
i
mean
slippery
he
hiding
in
the
belfry
now
hoping
you
not
discover
him
there
you
see
he
scaled
the
wall
by
means
of
this
silk
ladder
i
removed
the
ladder
and
i
assume
he
still
up
there
why
the
skunk
pete
exclaimed
wrathfully
so
he
planned
to
rob
us
i
get
him
leaving
al
to
watch
penny
the
guard
ran
to
the
tower
room
door
and
unlocked
it
stealthily
he
crept
up
the
iron
stairway
which
led
to
the
belfry
suddenly
those
below
heard
a
cry
of
rage
followed
by
the
sound
of
scuffling
al
gepper
listened
tensely
yet
made
no
move
to
join
the
fight
he
remained
standing
between
penny
and
the
outside
door
you
were
right
he
admitted
in
a
stunned
voice
slippery
up
there
he
meant
to
get
all
the
swag
for
himself
the
fight
increased
in
intensity
as
the
two
men
struggled
on
the
belfry
steps
over
and
over
they
rolled
first
one
delivering
a
hard
blow
and
then
the
other
still
locked
they
finally
toppled
to
the
floor
but
even
then
al
gepper
remained
a
bystander
penny
was
less
concerned
with
the
fight
than
with
thoughts
of
escape
she
had
hoped
that
al
too
would
join
the
battle
apparently
he
was
taking
no
chance
of
letting
her
get
away
she
considered
attempting
a
sudden
break
for
freedom
but
immediately
abandoned
it
the
outside
door
had
been
locked
by
pete
before
she
could
turn
the
key
al
would
be
upon
her
as
for
the
windows
none
were
open
while
they
might
not
be
locked
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
reach
one
quickly
enough
penny
gaze
roved
to
the
tower
room
once
more
and
the
struggling
men
high
above
their
heads
she
saw
something
which
previously
had
not
drawn
her
attention
it
was
a
loop
of
rope
hanging
from
the
belfry
why
that
must
be
attached
to
the
old
church
bell
thought
penny
if
only
i
could
reach
it
i
might
be
able
to
bring
help
here
however
the
rope
dangled
high
overhead
even
if
she
were
able
to
reach
the
room
leading
to
the
tower
there
was
nothing
upon
which
she
could
stand
to
grasp
the
loop
obviously
the
rope
had
been
cut
short
years
before
to
prevent
anyone
from
ringing
the
bell
penny
glanced
toward
al
gepper
the
medium
gaze
was
upon
the
two
struggling
men
not
her
a
golden
opportunity
presented
itself
if
only
she
had
the
wits
to
make
use
of
it
almost
at
the
girl
feet
lay
the
tangle
of
silken
ladder
as
she
stared
at
it
a
sudden
idea
took
possession
of
her
the
iron
hooks
would
serve
her
purpose
but
dared
she
try
it
if
she
failed
and
the
chances
were
against
her
punishment
would
be
certain
yet
if
she
did
nothing
and
merely
waited
it
was
likely
that
al
gepper
and
his
pals
never
would
be
brought
to
justice
she
must
take
the
chance
no
matter
how
great
the
personal
risk
for
a
moment
penny
remained
inactive
planning
what
she
must
do
if
she
made
a
single
mistake
fumbled
at
the
critical
instant
everything
would
be
lost
above
all
her
aim
must
be
accurate
if
she
missed
the
loop
slippery
and
pete
were
beginning
to
tire
their
blows
becoming
futile
and
ineffective
further
delay
in
executing
her
plan
only
increased
the
danger
she
must
act
now
or
never
her
mind
made
up
penny
no
longer
hesitated
with
a
quick
movement
she
seized
the
silken
ladder
and
darted
to
the
doorway
of
the
bell
tower
hey
shouted
al
gepper
starting
after
her
penny
slammed
the
door
in
his
face
taking
careful
aim
she
hurled
the
silken
ladder
upward
one
of
the
iron
hooks
caught
in
the
loop
of
the
rope
she
jerked
on
it
and
to
her
joy
the
bell
began
to
ring
chapter
wooden
penny
pulled
the
rope
again
and
again
causing
the
huge
bell
to
sway
back
and
forth
violently
it
rang
many
times
before
al
gepper
succeeded
in
opening
the
tower
room
door
his
face
was
crimson
with
fury
when
he
seized
the
girl
hurling
her
away
from
the
rope
with
one
quick
toss
he
released
the
hooks
of
the
silken
ladder
stuffing
the
soft
strands
beneath
his
coat
the
bell
made
a
final
clang
and
became
silent
penny
retreated
against
the
wall
anticipating
severe
punishment
for
her
act
however
al
and
his
companions
were
more
concerned
with
thoughts
of
escape
than
with
her
we
got
to
get
out
of
here
muttered
al
come
on
the
two
men
on
the
floor
had
ceased
their
struggles
painfully
they
regained
their
feet
in
this
sudden
emergency
they
had
forgotten
their
differences
what
shall
we
do
about
the
box
in
the
tower
pete
demanded
nursing
a
swollen
eye
leave
it
here
returned
al
we
ca
save
anything
now
the
police
are
apt
to
swoop
down
on
us
any
minute
turning
he
fled
to
the
street
pete
and
slippery
hesitated
then
followed
penny
heard
a
key
turn
in
the
lock
even
before
she
tested
the
door
she
knew
she
had
been
imprisoned
in
the
tower
room
they
escaped
after
all
she
thought
dismally
but
i
may
have
saved
some
of
the
loot
i
take
a
look
quickly
she
climbed
the
iron
stairs
to
the
belfry
from
the
turret
she
obtained
a
perfect
view
of
the
entire
lane
al
gepper
was
running
down
the
street
while
pete
and
slippery
had
turned
toward
the
cemetery
there
were
no
other
persons
in
the
vicinity
penny
thought
at
first
glance
then
her
heart
leaped
as
she
saw
three
men
entering
the
lane
at
its
junction
with
the
main
street
they
too
were
running
they
must
have
heard
the
bell
she
told
herself
oh
if
only
i
can
make
them
understand
what
has
happened
her
best
means
of
attracting
attention
was
by
ringing
the
bell
she
pushed
against
it
and
was
rewarded
by
a
deafening
clang
the
men
stopped
short
staring
toward
the
belfry
penny
cupped
her
hands
and
shouted
her
words
did
not
carry
plainly
but
the
newcomers
seemed
to
gain
an
inkling
of
what
was
amiss
for
they
wheeled
and
began
to
pursue
the
two
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
cemetery
from
her
high
perch
penny
saw
al
gepper
nearing
the
end
of
the
lane
unobserved
by
all
save
herself
tapping
the
bell
again
she
called
get
him
too
at
the
end
of
the
street
one
of
the
pursuers
halted
turning
toward
the
tower
in
the
moonlight
penny
saw
his
face
and
recognized
jerry
livingston
he
was
close
enough
now
to
hear
her
voice
it
al
gepper
she
shouted
do
let
him
escape
the
reporter
turned
but
as
he
started
off
in
the
new
direction
both
he
and
penny
saw
the
fleeing
man
climbing
into
leaping
lena
with
a
grinding
of
gears
he
drove
away
jerry
stopped
thinking
that
he
never
could
overtake
the
car
keep
after
him
jerry
encouraged
penny
the
gas
tank
is
almost
empty
he
ca
possibly
go
more
than
three
or
four
blocks
as
the
reporter
again
took
up
the
chase
she
began
tolling
the
bell
once
more
determined
to
arouse
everyone
within
a
mile
of
the
temple
her
energy
was
rewarded
for
in
another
minute
she
heard
the
familiar
wail
of
a
siren
a
police
cruiser
swerved
alongside
the
tower
stopping
with
a
lurch
what
the
idea
of
ringing
that
bell
demanded
an
officer
leaping
to
the
ground
tersely
penny
explained
the
situation
the
two
policemen
took
a
through
a
vacant
lot
circling
the
cemetery
darkness
swallowed
them
but
presently
there
came
a
muffled
command
to
halt
followed
by
a
revolver
shot
so
excited
was
penny
that
she
nearly
tumbled
from
the
bell
tower
recovering
her
balance
she
sat
on
the
stone
ledge
trying
to
remain
calm
her
nerves
were
jumpy
and
on
edge
if
only
jerry
captures
al
gepper
that
all
i
ask
she
breathed
as
the
minutes
elapsed
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
not
yet
searched
for
the
loot
which
she
believed
to
be
hidden
in
the
belfry
with
questing
fingers
she
groped
beneath
the
ledge
for
a
short
distance
she
felt
nothing
then
she
encountered
a
long
wooden
box
before
she
could
open
it
she
heard
shouts
from
the
direction
of
the
cemetery
four
men
two
of
them
police
officers
were
marching
slippery
and
pete
toward
the
temple
as
they
came
nearer
she
received
another
pleasant
surprise
the
two
who
had
aided
in
the
capture
were
her
father
and
salt
sommers
a
photographer
for
the
dad
shouted
penny

you
get
me
down
from
this
pigeon
roost
parker
separating
from
the
others
came
to
the
foot
of
the
bell
tower
so
it
was
you
who
sounded
the
alarm
he
exclaimed

the
police
to

he
after
al
gepper
who
rode
off
in
my
car
the
police
cruiser
was
dispatched
leaving
one
officer
to
guard
the
two
prisoners
parker
unlocked
the
door
of
the
tower
room
releasing
his
daughter
you
all
right
he
asked
anxiously
of
course
here
a
little
present
for
you
penny
thrust
the
wooden
box
into
his
hands
what
this
i
do
know
yet
i
found
it
hidden
in
the
belfry
penny
if
you
fell
into
a
river
you
would
come
up
with
a
chest
of
gold
exclaimed
the
publisher
admiringly
open
it
quick
dad
parker
required
no
urging
the
box
was
locked
but
he
pried
off
the
cover
hinges
exposing
the
contents
a
real
treasure
exclaimed
penny
the
box
contained
several
bracelets
one
of
them
set
with
rubies
and
diamonds
countless
rings
four
watches
and
several
strings
of
matched
pearls
stolen
loot
ejaculated
the
publisher
and
what
a
collection
chuckled
penny
as
she
examined
the
separate
pieces
there
enough
plunder
here
to
start
a
jewelry
store
likewise
sufficient
evidence
to
put
this
celestial
temple
gang
out
of
circulation
for
a
long
long
time
added
her
father
i
learned
a
lot
tonight
dad
wait
until
i
tell
you
a
scoop
for
the
you
be
able
to
use
your
largest
blackest
headlines
penny
began
to
tell
her
story
interrupting
only
when
slippery
and
pete
were
brought
into
the
building
handcuffed
together
starting
again
she
made
her
charges
accusing
slippery
not
only
of
having
committed
the
henley
burglary
but
also
of
having
robbed
the
kohls
and
many
prominent
riverview
families
after
inspecting
the
jewelry
found
in
the
wooden
box
one
of
the
police
officers
definitely
identified
several
of
the
pieces
as
stolen
goods
he
expressed
an
opinion
that
the
jewelry
had
been
hidden
in
the
belfry
because
it
was
too
hot
to
be
disposed
of
by
fences
the
organization
members
had
an
agreement
by
which
all
shared
in
the
loot
added
penny
that
caused
trouble
al
gepper
and
slippery
thought
they
were
taking
most
of
the
risk
without
sufficient
return
so
they
pulled
a
few
extra
jobs
of
their
own
before
she
could
reveal
more
the
police
car
was
heard
outside
the
temple
from
the
window
penny
saw
that
jerry
and
the
policeman
were
returning
with
al
gepper
who
had
been
handcuffed
they
caught
him
she
cried
jubilantly
the
prisoner
was
brought
into
the
temple
to
be
identified
he
had
been
captured
when
leaping
lena
had
stalled
for
lack
of
gasoline
as
gepper
was
searched
the
silken
ladder
and
various
small
objects
were
removed
from
his
coat
penny
noticed
two
tiny
rubber
suction
cups
no
larger
than
dimes
and
immediately
made
up
her
mind
that
later
she
would
try
to
obtain
them
she
was
quite
certain
she
knew
their
purpose
penny
told
her
story
and
learned
in
turn
that
after
she
had
telephoned
jerry
he
had
traced
her
father
and
with
the
police
both
had
hastened
to
the
hodges
cottage
arriving
there
they
discovered
that
gepper
had
fled
jerry
parker
and
salt
sommers
had
immediately
proceeded
to
the
celestial
temple
it
was
lucky
you
rang
that
bell
penny
chuckled
jerry
if
you
had
we
never
would
have
arrived
here
in
time
it
was
lucky
too
that
gepper
tried
to
escape
in
lena
she
laughed
i
guess
my
old
has
redeemed
itself
one
of
the
officers
picked
up
the
silken
ladder
examining
it
with
critical
interest
he
agreed
that
it
had
undoubtedly
been
used
in
many
mysterious
burglaries
committed
during
the
past
month
it
obvious
that
slippery
approached
the
houses
on
the
side
and
scaled
the
wall
after
hooking
his
ladder
into
a
window
ledge
penny
remarked
i
suppose
he
reasoned
that
windows
nearly
always
are
left
unlocked
but
how
did
he
learn
the
houses
were
deserted
by
telephoning
that
would
be
my
opinion
nodded
the
policeman
if
someone
answered
he
could
hang
up
otherwise
he
would
be
fairly
sure
the
house
was
empty
one
night
at
the
theatre
i
saw
a
man
who
resembled
slippery
noting
down
the
license
number
of
the
kohl
car
but
the
house
was
robbed
within
a
few
hours
after
that
how
could
he
have
obtained
the
name
and
address
easily
there
are
fences
who
supply
such
data
to
fellow
members
of
the
underworld
it
is
also
possible
that
slippery
previously
had
watched
the
kohl
house
obtained
the
car
license
number
and
then
watched
for
it
later
at
the
theatre
jerry
already
had
supplied
police
with
the
name
of
the
fence
whose
establishment
slippery
had
visited
earlier
in
the
day
later
a
raid
staged
there
brought
to
light
much
loot
taken
from
various
riverview
homes
however
for
the
moment
police
were
most
interested
in
gaining
complete
information
which
could
be
used
in
rounding
up
all
members
of
the
celestial
temple
society
who
had
not
fled
the
city
searching
slippery
they
found
not
only
jewelry
stolen
from
the
henley
residence
but
a
booklet
containing
many
names
and
telephone
numbers
sadie
beardsell
penny
read
she
one
of
the
members
i
am
sure
lest
and
hodges
might
also
be
arrested
she
explained
that
the
old
couple
had
been
an
innocent
dupe
of
al
gepper
turning
to
the
medium
she
said
i
think
i
know
how
you
accomplished
most
of
your
tricks
of
course
you
were
the
one
who
sent
hodges
a
letter
with
six
dollars
undoubtedly
you
had
it
mailed
by
an
accomplice
from
new
york
at
exactly
the
hour
you
specified
then
at
that
same
hour
you
slipped
up
to
the
hodges
cottage
and
rapped
six
times
on
the
bedroom
wall
you
seem
to
have
everything
figured
out
al
gepper
responded
sarcastically
clever
girl
i
saw
how
you
made
the
spirit
painting
tonight
at
the
séance
resumed
penny
may
i
ask
if
that
same
method
was
used
in
regard
to
picture
of
cousin
david
she
did
not
dream
that
the
medium
would
answer
her
question
with
a
shrug
which
implied
that
the
entire
matter
was
very
boring
he
replied
no
the
picture
was
painted
with
a
solution
of
sulphocyanid
of
potassium
and
other
chemicals
invisible
until
brought
out
with
a
during
the
séance
an
assistant
sprayed
the
back
of
the
canvas
with
an
atomizer
bringing
out
the
colors
one
by
one
and
how
was
the
paint
made
to
appear
wet
poppy
oil
one
more
question
gepper
i
never
could
understand
how
you
were
able
to
raise
the
kitchen
table
at
hodges
cottage
no
al
gepper
smiled
mockingly
i
assure
you
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
demonstration
it
was
a
true
spirit
manifestation
i
never
believe
that
declared
penny
then
figure
it
out
for
yourself
replied
the
medium
you
are
such
a
very
brilliant
child
before
the
prisoners
were
led
to
the
police
car
salt
sommers
set
up
his
camera
and
took
a
number
of
flashlight
pictures
for
the
how
about
it
mr
parker
inquired
jerry
eagerly
are
we
putting
out
an
extra
we
are
said
the
publisher
crisply
this
is
the
big
break
i
been
hoping
we
would
get
we
should
beat
the
on
the
story
by
at
least
a
half
hour
the
three
men
hurriedly
left
the
celestial
temple
with
penny
trailing
behind
them
at
the
main
street
intersection
they
finally
obtained
a
taxicab
to
the
office
parker
ordered
an
extra
dollar
if
you
step
on
it
how
about
my
pictures
salt
sommers
asked
as
the
cab
rocked
around
a
corner
they
ought
to
be
dandies
rush
them
through
as
soon
as
we
get
to
the
office
parker
instructed
if
they
any
good
we
run
on
page
one
jerry
you
handle
the
story
play
it
for
all
it
worth
jerry
glanced
at
penny
who
sat
very
still
between
her
father
and
salt
their
eyes
met
chief
he
said
there
a
sort
of
fraternity
among
reporters
an
unwritten
rule
that
we
never
chisel
on
each
other
work
what
that
parker
asked
startled
i
do
get
it
then
his
glance
fell
upon
his
daughter
and
he
smiled
oh
so
it
that
way
you
think
penny
should
write
the
story
i
do
chief
it
hers
from
the
ground
floor
up
please
dad
may
i
penny
pleaded
the
cab
rolled
up
to
the
office
stopping
with
a
jerk
parker
swung
open
the
door
helping
her
alight
the
story
is
yours
penny
he
said
that
is
if
you
can
crack
it
out
fast
enough
to
make
the
extra
i
do
it
or
die
in
the
attempt
keep
to
the
facts
and
write
terse
simple
english
parker
began
but
penny
did
not
wait
to
hear
his
instructions
with
a
triumphant
laugh
she
ran
ahead
into
the
office
her
entry
into
the
newsroom
was
both
dramatic
and
noisy
big
scoop
dewitt
she
called
cheerily
start
the
old
print
factory
running
full
blast
dropping
into
a
chair
behind
the
nearest
typewriter
she
began
to
write
chapter
penny
stood
at
the
window
of
her
father
office
listening
to
the
newsboys
crying
their
wares
on
the
street
extra
read
all
about
it
police
capture
three
in
raid
on
celestial
temple
extra
extra
parker
rocked
back
in
his
swivel
chair
smiling
at
his
daughter
your
story
was
penny
he
said
thanks
to
you
we
scooped
the
tired
i
do
feel
rather
washed
out
penny
admitted
writing
at
high
speed
with
a
deadline
jabbing
you
in
the
back
is
worse
than
facing
a
gang
of
crooks
but
it
was
exciting
you
turned
in
a
good
story
her
father
praised
again
in
fact
you
may
as
well
take
credit
for
breaking
up
that
outfit
of
fake
spiritualists
so
far
the
police
have
only
captured
al
gepper
slippery
and
pete
there
not
much
evidence
against
the
others
true
but
rest
assured
those
who
are
rounded
up
will
leave
riverview
the
backbone
of
the
organization
has
been
smashed
penny
sank
wearily
into
a
chair
picking
up
a
copy
of
the
which
lay
on
her
father
desk
black
headlines
proclaimed
the
capture
and
opening
from
the
banner
was
her
own
story
tagged
with
a
credit
line
penelope
salt
sommer
photographs
had
made
the
front
page
too
and
there
was
a
brief
contribution
by
jerry
telling
of
al
gepper
attempted
flight
in
leaping
lena
dad
you
must
admit
that
it
was
a
stroke
of
genius
when
i
bought
back
that
old
car
remarked
penny
why
if
it
had
been
for
lena
al
gepper
surely
would
have
escaped
that
and
the
fact
you
always
run
your
cars
on
an
empty
tank
responded
parker
i
suppose
you
foresaw
the
future
when
you
made
your
brilliant
purchase
not
exactly
it
was
just
a
feeling
i
had
the
same
sort
of
hunch
which
came
to
me
when
i
found
the
silken
ladder
at
kano
curio
shop
if
i
depended
upon
a
mere
brain
to
solve
mysteries
why
i
be
no
better
than
the
police
your
modesty
overwhelms
me
chuckled
her
father
i
thankful
my
other
reporters
are
guided
by
their
instincts
otherwise
i
might
have
a
scoop
a
day
there
one
thing
which
annoys
me
penny
said
frowning
and
what
is
that
two
of
al
gepper
tricks
have
been
explained
how
was
he
able
to
raise
a
table
and
read
a
message
in
a
sealed
envelope
i
was
talking
to
the
chief
of
police
about
that
letter
trick
only
this
morning
penny
magicians
often
employ
it
was
the
message
written
on
a
pad
of
paper
before
it
was
placed
in
the
envelope
yes
it
was
then
very
likely
gepper
read
the
message
from
the
pad
he
could
have
placed
carbon
paper
beneath
the
second
or
third
sheets
possibly
he
resorted
to
a
thin
covering
of
paraffin
wax
which
would
be
less
noticeable
now
that
i
recall
it
he
did
glance
at
the
pad
how
would
you
guess
he
lifted
the
table
were
his
hands
held
high
above
it
penny
only
an
inch
or
two
however
he
never
touched
the
table
i
was
able
to
see
that
could
he
have
used
sharp
steel
pins
held
between
his
fingers
i
doubt
it
but
i
think
i
know
what
he
may
have
used
did
you
notice
two
small
suction
cups
which
were
taken
from
his
pockets
by
the
police
well
no
i
did
penny
the
longer
i
mull
over
it
the
more
i
convinced
he
used
them
to
raise
the
table
they
could
be
held
between
the
fingers
and
would
be
observed
in
a
darkened
room
dad
if
i
can
get
those
rubber
cups
from
the
police
i
have
some
fun
the
telephone
rang
it
was
weems
calling
to
ask
if
penny
were
safe
parker
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
handed
the
receiver
to
his
daughter
penny
i
just
read
your
story
in
the
paper
the
housekeeper
scolded
you
never
should
have
pitted
yourself
against
those
dangerous
men
i
declare
you
need
someone
to
watch
you
every
minute
i
need
you
said
penny
and
so
does
dad
why
not
promise
to
stay
with
us
instead
of
going
away
on
a
trip
of
course
i
remain
came
weems
surprising
answer
i
made
up
my
mind
to
that
two
days
ago
you
and
your
father
never
could
take
care
of
yourselves
what
will
you
do
with
your
inheritance
mrs
weems
i
hope
your
father
will
invest
it
for
me
replied
the
housekeeper
meekly
one
thing
i
know
no
medium
will
tell
me
what
to
do
with
it
the
hour
was
late
penny
felt
relieved
when
her
father
locked
his
desk
in
preparation
for
leaving
the
office
they
walked
through
the
newsroom
down
the
stairway
to
the
street
a
man
in
a
brown
suit
and
derby
hat
alighted
from
a
taxi
pausing
as
he
saw
them
mr
parker
he
called
may
i
speak
with
you
the
publisher
turned
recognizing
him
mr
henley
he
exclaimed
i
have
just
come
from
the
police
station
the
advertiser
said
in
an
agitated
voice
i
was
told
that
your
daughter
is
responsible
for
the
capture
of
the
men
who
robbed
our
home
tonight
yes
penny
managed
to
have
a
rather
busy
evening
smiled
parker
i
hope
you
suffered
no
loss
everything
was
recovered
thanks
to
your
daughter
miss
parker
i
realize
i
never
can
properly
express
my
appreciation
i
was
sorry
i
could
prevent
the
burglary
replied
penny
stiffly
as
it
turned
out
the
capture
of
the
crooks
was
mostly
due
to
luck
you
are
too
modest
protested
henley
i
talked
with
the
police
you
know
i
am
truly
grateful
the
man
hesitated
evidently
wishing
to
say
more
yet
scarcely
knowing
how
to
shape
his
words
penny
and
her
father
started
to
move
away
oh
about
that
contract
we
were
discussing
today
the
advertiser
said
quickly
yes
parker
paused
i
been
thinking
it
over
i
acted
too
hastily
in
deciding
to
cancel
henley
please
do
not
feel
that
you
are
under
obligation
said
the
publisher
quietly
even
though
penny
accidentally
did
you
a
favor
it
not
that
henley
interrupted
the
is
a
good
paper
the
best
in
riverview
said
penny
softly
yes
it
is
henley
declared
with
sudden
emphasis
i
tell
you
parker
i
was
irritated
because
of
a
trivial
mistake
in
my
firm
copy
i
cooled
off
now
suppose
we
talk
over
the
matter
tomorrow
at
lunch
very
well
agreed
parker
the
commodore
hotel
at
one
bowing
to
penny
henley
retreated
into
a
waiting
taxi
and
drove
away
how
do
you
like
that
dad
penny
inquired
after
a
moment
silence
i
like
it
answered
parker
the
could
have
limped
along
without
henley
but
the
going
would
have
been
tough
he
renew
the
old
contract
oh
yes
and
probably
give
us
a
better
one
stealing
henley
words
i
am
truly
grateful
penny
gazed
at
her
father
with
twinkling
eyes
are
those
idle
words
dad
or
are
you
willing
to
back
them
in
a
material
way
i
might
grinned
parker
present
your
bill
well
dad
i
discovered
to
my
sorrow
that
i
ca
support
two
cars
on
my
present
allowance
i
need
a
generous
raise
you
could
get
rid
of
lena
why
dad
after
her
noble
work
tonight
no
i
suppose
not
sighed
parker
you
earned
an
increase
and
i
may
as
well
grant
it
retroactive
to
the
time
i
started
working
on
the
story
added
penny
i
figure
if
you
pay
back
allowance
i
be
solvent
once
more
you
drive
a
hard
bargain
chuckled
the
publisher
but
i
agree
arm
in
arm
they
started
on
down
the
street
rounding
a
corner
of
the
building
they
abruptly
paused
before
the
window
to
watch
a
long
unbroken
sheet
of
white
paper
feed
through
the
thundering
press
freshly
inked
newspapers
cut
and
folded
slid
out
one
upon
the
other
to
be
borne
away
for
distribution
it
modern
magic
is
it
dad
penny
said
reflectively
as
the
great
machine
pounded
in
steady
rhythm
yes
penny
her
father
agreed
and
for
this
edition
at
least
you
were
the
master
magician
the
end
transcriber
notes
replaced
the
list
of
books
in
the
series
by
the
complete
list
as
in
the
final
book
the
cry
at
midnight
silently
corrected
a
handful
of
palpable
typos
conforming
to
later
volumes
