but
how
about
a
live
wire
a
smart
businessman
in
a
civilization
of
pure
chumps
some
things
had
not
changed
a
potter
wheel
was
still
a
wheel
and
clay
was
still
clay
efim
hawkins
had
built
his
shop
near
goose
lake
which
had
a
narrow
band
of
good
fat
clay
and
a
narrow
beach
of
white
sand
he
fired
three
kilns
with
willow
charcoal
from
the
wood
lot
the
wood
lot
was
also
useful
for
long
walks
while
the
kilns
were
cooling
if
he
let
himself
stay
within
sight
of
them
he
would
open
them
prematurely
impatient
to
see
how
some
new
shape
or
glaze
had
come
through
the
fire
and
the
new
shape
or
glaze
would
be
good
for
nothing
but
the
shard
pile
back
of
his
slip
tanks
a
business
conference
was
in
full
swing
in
his
shop
a
modest
cube
of
brick
as
the
angeles
rocket
thundered
overhead
very
noisy
very
very
fiery
jets
shaped
as
sleekly
as
an
airborne
barracuda
the
buyer
from
marshall
fields
was
turning
over
a
one
liter
carafe
nodding
approval
with
his
massive
handsome
head
this
is
real
pretty
he
told
hawkins
and
his
own
secretary
this
has
got
lots
of
what
ya
call
real
principles
yeah
it
is
real
pretty
how
much
the
secretary
asked
the
potter
each
in
dozen
lots
said
hawkins
i
ran
up
fifteen
dozen
last
month
they
are
real
repeated
the
buyer
from
fields
i
will
take
them
all
i
do
think
we
can
do
that
doctor
said
the
secretary
cost
us
that
would
leave
only
in
our
quarter
budget
and
we
still
have
to
run
down
to
east
liverpool
to
pick
up
some
cheap
dinner
sets
dinner
sets
asked
the
buyer
his
big
face
full
of
wonder
dinner
sets
the
department
been
out
of
them
for
two
months
now
got
pretty
nasty
about
it
yesterday
remember
that
bluenose
the
buyer
said
contemptuously
he
do
know
nothin
about
why
for
he
lem
me
run
my
own
department
his
eye
fell
on
a
stray
copy
of
and
he
sat
down
with
it
an
occasional
deep
chuckle
or
grunt
of
surprise
escaped
him
as
he
turned
the
pages
uninterrupted
the
potter
and
the
buyer
secretary
quickly
closed
a
deal
for
two
dozen
of
the
liter
carafes
i
wish
we
could
take
more
said
the
secretary
but
you
heard
what
i
told
him
we
had
to
turn
away
customers
for
ordinary
dinnerware
because
he
shot
the
last
quarter
budget
on
some
mexican
piggy
banks
some
equally
enthusiastic
importer
stuck
him
with
the
fifth
floor
is
packed
solid
with
them
i
bet
they
look
mighty
they
painted
with
purple
cacti
the
potter
shuddered
and
caressed
the
glaze
of
the
sample
carafe
the
buyer
looked
up
and
rumbled
ai
you
dummies
through
yet
what
good
a
seckertary
for
he
do
take
the
burden
of
my
back
harh
we
all
through
doctor
are
you
ready
to
go
the
buyer
grunted
peevishly
dropped
on
the
floor
and
led
the
way
out
of
the
building
and
down
the
log
corduroy
road
to
the
highway
his
car
was
waiting
on
the
concrete
it
was
like
all
contemporary
cars
too
to
get
over
the
logs
he
climbed
down
into
the
car
and
started
the
motor
with
a
tremendous
sparkle
and
roar
called
out
the
potter
under
cover
of
the
noise
did
anything
come
of
the
radiation
program
they
were
working
on
the
last
time
i
was
on
duty
at
the
pole
the
same
old
fallacy
said
the
secretary
gloomily
it
stopped
us
on
mutation
it
stopped
us
on
culling
it
stopped
us
on
segregation
and
now
it
stopped
us
on
hypnosis
well
i
scheduled
back
to
the
grind
in
nine
days
time
for
another
firing
right
now
i
got
a
new
luster
to
try
i
miss
you
i
shall
be
running
the
drafting
room
of
the
new
century
engineering
corporation
in
denver
they
going
to
put
up
a
two
office
building
and
naturally
somebody
got
to
be
on
hand
naturally
said
hawkins
with
a
sour
smile
there
was
an
sweet
blast
as
the
buyer
leaned
on
the
horn
button
also
a
jet
of
what
looked
like
flame
spurted
up
from
the
car
radiator
cap
the
car
power
plant
was
a
gas
turbine
and
had
no
radiator
i
coming
doctor
said
the
secretary
dispiritedly
he
climbed
down
into
the
car
and
it
whooshed
off
with
much
flame
and
noise
the
potter
depressed
wandered
back
up
the
corduroy
road
and
contemplated
his
cooling
kilns
the
rustling
wind
in
the
boughs
was
obscuring
the
creak
and
mutter
of
the
shrinking
refractory
brick
hawkins
wondered
about
the
number
two
kiln
a
reduction
fire
on
a
load
of
lusterware
mugs
had
the
clay
chinking
excluded
the
air
had
it
been
a
properly
smoky
blaze
would
it
do
any
harm
if
he
just
took
one
close
common
sense
took
hawkins
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
yanked
him
over
to
the
tool
shed
he
got
out
his
pick
and
resolutely
set
off
on
a
prospecting
jaunt
to
a
hummocky
field
that
might
yield
some
oxides
he
was
especially
low
on
coppers
the
long
walk
left
him
sweating
hard
with
his
lust
for
a
peek
into
the
kiln
quiet
in
his
breast
he
swung
his
pick
almost
at
random
into
one
of
the
hummocks
it
clanged
on
a
stone
which
he
excavated
a
largely
obliterated
inscription
said
ersity
of
chic
ogical
labo
eloved
memory
of
killed
in
act
the
potter
swore
mildly
he
had
hoped
the
field
would
turn
out
to
be
a
cemetery
preferably
a
cemetery
full
of
bronze
caskets
moldered
into
oxides
of
tin
and
copper
well
hell
maybe
there
was
some
around
anyway
he
headed
lackadaisically
for
the
second
largest
hillock
and
sliced
into
it
with
his
pick
there
was
a
stone
to
undercut
and
topple
into
a
trench
and
then
the
potter
was
very
glad
he
stuck
at
it
his
nostrils
were
filled
with
the
bitter
smell
and
the
dirt
was
tinged
with
the
exciting
blue
of
copper
salts
the
pick
went
hawkins
puffing
pried
up
a
stainless
steel
plate
that
was
quite
badly
stained
and
was
also
marked
with
incised
letters
it
seemed
to
have
pulled
loose
from
rotting
bronze
there
were
rivets
on
the
back
that
brought
up
flakes
of
green
patina
the
potter
wiped
off
the
surface
dirt
with
his
sleeve
turned
it
to
catch
the
sunlight
obliquely
and
read
honest
john
barlow
honest
john
famed
in
university
annals
represents
a
challenge
which
medical
science
has
not
yet
answered
revival
of
a
human
being
accidentally
thrown
into
a
state
of
suspended
animation
in
barlow
a
leading
evanston
real
estate
dealer
visited
his
dentist
for
treatment
of
an
impacted
wisdom
tooth
his
dentist
requested
and
received
permission
to
use
the
experimental
anesthetic
developed
at
the
university
after
administration
of
the
anesthetic
the
dentist
resorted
to
his
drill
by
freakish
mischance
a
short
circuit
in
his
machine
delivered
volts
of
current
into
the
patient
in
a
damage
suit
instituted
by
barlow
against
the
dentist
the
university
and
the
makers
of
the
drill
a
jury
found
for
the
defendants
barlow
never
got
up
from
the
dentist
chair
and
was
assumed
to
have
died
of
poisoning
electrocution
or
both
morticians
preparing
him
for
embalming
discovered
however
that
their
subject
was
though
certainly
not
living
just
as
certainly
not
dead
the
university
was
notified
and
a
series
of
exhaustive
tests
was
begun
including
attempts
to
duplicate
the
trance
state
on
volunteers
after
a
bad
run
of
seven
cases
which
ended
fatally
the
attempts
were
abandoned
honest
john
was
long
an
exhibit
at
the
university
museum
and
livened
many
a
football
game
as
mascot
of
the
university
blue
crushers
the
bounds
of
taste
were
overstepped
however
when
a
pledge
to
sigma
delta
chi
was
ordered
in
to
kidnap
honest
john
from
his
loosely
guarded
glass
museum
case
and
introduce
him
into
the
rachel
swanson
memorial
girls
gymnasium
shower
room
on
may
the
university
board
of
regents
issued
the
following
order
by
unanimous
vote
it
is
directed
that
the
remains
of
honest
john
barlow
be
removed
from
the
university
museum
and
conveyed
to
the
university
lieutenant
james
scott
iii
memorial
biological
laboratories
and
there
be
securely
locked
in
a
specially
prepared
vault
it
is
further
directed
that
all
possible
measures
for
the
preservation
of
these
remains
be
taken
by
the
laboratory
administration
and
that
access
to
these
remains
be
denied
to
all
persons
except
qualified
scholars
authorized
in
writing
by
the
board
the
board
reluctantly
takes
this
action
in
view
of
recent
notices
and
photographs
in
the
nation
press
which
to
say
the
least
reflect
but
small
credit
upon
the
university
it
was
far
from
his
field
but
hawkins
understood
what
had
happened
an
early
and
accidental
blundering
onto
the
bare
bones
of
the
levantman
shock
anesthesia
which
had
since
been
replaced
by
other
methods
to
bring
subjects
out
of
levantman
shock
you
let
them
have
a
squirt
of
simple
saline
in
the
trigeminal
nerve
interesting
and
now
about
that
bronze
he
heaved
the
pick
into
the
rotting
green
salts
expecting
no
resistence
and
almost
fractured
his
wrist
down
there
was
he
began
to
flake
off
the
oxides
a
half
hour
of
work
brought
him
down
to
phosphor
bronze
a
huge
casting
of
the
almost
incorruptible
metal
it
had
weakened
structurally
over
the
centuries
he
could
fit
the
point
of
his
pick
under
a
corroded
boss
and
pry
off
great
creaking
and
grumbling
striae
of
the
stuff
hawkins
wished
he
had
an
archeologist
with
him
but
did
dream
of
returning
to
his
shop
and
calling
one
to
take
over
the
find
he
was
an
man
by
choice
and
in
his
free
time
an
artist
in
clay
and
glaze
by
necessity
an
automotive
electronics
and
atomic
engineer
who
could
also
swing
a
project
in
traffic
control
individual
and
group
psychology
architecture
or
tool
design
he
did
yell
for
a
specialist
every
time
something
out
of
his
line
came
up
there
were
so
few
with
so
much
to
do
he
trenched
around
his
find
discovering
that
it
was
a
great
bronze
mass
with
an
excitingly
hollow
sound
a
long
strip
of
moldering
metal
from
one
of
the
long
vertical
faces
pulled
away
exposing
red
rust
that
went
and
was
sucked
into
the
interior
of
the
mass
it
had
been
thought
hawkins
and
there
must
have
been
an
inner
jacket
of
glass
which
had
crystalized
through
the
centuries
and
quietly
crumbled
at
the
first
clang
of
his
pick
he
did
know
what
a
vacuum
would
do
to
a
subject
of
levantman
shock
but
he
had
hopes
nor
did
he
quite
understand
what
a
real
estate
dealer
was
but
it
might
have
something
to
do
with
pottery
and
might
have
a
bearing
on
topic
number
one
he
flung
his
pick
out
of
the
trench
climbed
out
and
set
off
at
a
for
his
shop
a
little
rummaging
turned
up
a
hypo
and
there
was
a
plasticontainer
of
salt
in
the
kitchen
back
at
his
dig
he
chipped
for
another
half
hour
to
expose
the
juncture
of
lid
and
body
the
hinges
were
hopeless
he
smashed
them
off
hawkins
extended
the
telescopic
handle
of
the
pick
for
the
best
leverage
fitted
its
point
into
a
deep
pit
set
its
fulcrum
and
heaved
five
more
heaves
and
he
could
see
inside
the
vault
what
looked
like
a
dusty
marble
statue
ten
more
and
he
could
see
that
it
was
the
naked
body
of
honest
john
barlow
evanston
real
estate
dealer
uncorrupted
by
time
the
potter
found
the
apex
of
the
trigeminal
nerve
with
his
point
and
gave
him
cc
in
an
hour
barlow
chest
began
to
pump
in
another
hour
he
rasped
did
it
work
it
muttered
hawkins
barlow
opened
his
eyes
and
stirred
looked
down
turned
his
hands
before
his
eyes
i
sue
he
screamed
my
clothes
my
fingernails
a
horrid
suspicion
came
over
his
face
and
he
clapped
his
hands
to
his
hairless
scalp
my
hair
he
wailed
i
sue
you
for
every
penny
you
got
that
release
wo
mean
a
damned
thing
in
court
i
did
sign
away
my
hair
and
clothes
and
fingernails
they
grow
back
said
hawkins
casually
also
your
epidermis
those
parts
of
you
were
alive
you
know
so
they
were
preserved
like
the
rest
of
you
i
afraid
the
clothes
are
gone
though
what
is
this
the
university
hospital
demanded
barlow
i
want
a
phone
no
you
phone
tell
my
wife
i
all
right
and
tell
sam
immerman
he
my
lawyer
to
get
over
here
right
away
greenleaf
ow
he
had
tried
to
sit
up
and
a
portion
of
his
pink
skin
rubbed
against
the
inner
surface
of
the
casket
which
was
powdered
by
the
ancient
crystalized
glass
what
the
hell
did
you
guys
do
boil
me
alive
oh
you
going
to
pay
for
this
you
all
right
said
hawkins
wishing
now
he
had
a
reference
book
to
clear
up
several
obscure
terms
your
epidermis
will
start
growing
immediately
you
not
in
the
hospital
look
here
he
handed
barlow
the
stainless
steel
plate
that
had
labeled
the
casket
after
a
suspicious
glance
the
man
started
to
read
finishing
he
laid
the
plate
carefully
on
the
edge
of
the
vault
and
was
silent
for
a
spell
poor
verna
he
said
at
last
it
does
say
whether
she
was
stuck
with
the
court
costs
do
you
happen
to
know
no
said
the
potter
all
i
know
is
what
was
on
the
plate
and
how
to
revive
you
the
dentist
accidentally
gave
you
a
dose
of
what
we
call
levantman
shock
anesthesia
we
have
used
it
for
centuries
it
was
powerful
but
too
dangerous
centuries
brooded
the
man
centuries
i
bet
sam
swindled
her
out
of
her
eyeteeth
poor
verna
how
long
ago
was
it
what
year
is
this
hawkins
shrugged
we
call
it
that
no
help
to
you
it
takes
a
long
time
for
these
metals
to
oxidize
like
that
movie
barlow
muttered
who
would
have
thought
it
poor
verna
he
blubbered
and
sniffled
reminding
hawkins
powerfully
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
found
under
a
flat
rock
almost
angrily
the
potter
demanded
how
many
children
did
you
have
none
yet
sniffed
barlow
my
first
wife
did
want
them
but
verna
wants
one
wanted
one
but
we
going
to
wait
until
we
going
to
wait
until
of
course
said
the
potter
feeling
a
savage
desire
to
tell
him
off
blast
him
to
hell
and
gone
for
his
work
but
he
choked
it
down
there
was
the
problem
to
think
of
there
was
always
the
problem
to
think
of
and
this
poor
blubberer
might
unexpectedly
supply
a
clue
hawkins
would
have
to
pass
him
on
come
along
hawkins
said
my
time
is
short
barlow
looked
up
outraged
how
can
you
be
so
unfeeling
i
a
human
being
like
the
los
rocket
thundered
overhead
and
barlow
broke
off
in
beautiful
he
breathed
following
it
with
his
eyes
beautiful
he
climbed
out
of
the
vault
too
interested
to
be
pained
by
its
roughness
against
his
infantile
skin
after
all
he
said
briskly
this
should
have
its
sunny
side
i
never
was
much
for
reading
but
this
is
just
like
one
of
those
stories
and
i
ought
to
make
some
money
out
of
it
should
i
he
gave
hawkins
a
shrewd
glance
you
want
money
asked
the
potter
here
he
handed
over
a
fistful
of
change
and
bills
you
better
put
my
shoes
on
it
be
about
a
oh
and
you
uh
modest
yes
that
was
the
word
here
hawkins
gave
him
his
pants
but
barlow
was
excitedly
counting
the
money
and
it
dollars
too
i
thought
be
credits
or
whatever
they
call
them
pluribus
unum
and
just
different
faces
say
is
there
a
catch
to
this
are
these
real
genuine
honest
dollars
like
we
had
or
just
wallpaper
they
quite
all
right
i
assure
you
said
the
potter
i
wish
come
along
i
in
a
hurry
the
man
babbled
as
they
stumped
toward
the
shop
where
are
we
going
the
council
of
scientists
the
world
coordinator
or
something
like
that
who
oh
no
we
call
them
and
no
that
would
do
any
good
at
all
i
just
taking
you
to
see
some
people
i
ought
to
make
plenty
out
of
this
i
could
write
books
get
some
smart
young
fellow
to
put
it
into
words
for
me
and
i
bet
i
could
turn
out
a
what
the
setup
on
things
like
that
it
about
like
that
smart
young
fellows
but
there
are
any
any
more
people
do
read
much
nowadays
we
find
something
equally
profitable
for
you
to
do
back
in
the
shop
hawkins
gave
barlow
a
suit
of
clothes
deposited
him
in
the
waiting
room
and
called
central
in
chicago
take
him
away
he
pleaded
i
have
time
for
one
more
firing
and
he
blathers
and
blathers
i
have
told
him
anything
perhaps
we
should
just
turn
him
loose
and
let
him
find
his
own
level
but
there
a
chance
the
problem
agreed
central
yes
there
a
chance
the
potter
delighted
barlow
by
making
him
a
cup
of
coffee
with
a
cube
that
not
only
dissolved
in
cold
water
but
heated
the
water
to
boiling
point
killing
time
hawkins
chatted
about
the
rocket
barlow
had
admired
and
had
to
haul
himself
up
short
he
had
almost
told
the
real
estate
man
what
its
top
speed
really
was
almost
indeed
revealed
that
it
was
not
a
rocket
he
regretted
too
that
he
had
so
casually
handed
barlow
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
the
man
seemed
obsessed
with
fear
that
they
were
worthless
since
hawkins
refused
to
take
a
note
or
or
even
a
definite
promise
of
repayment
but
hawkins
could
go
into
details
and
was
very
glad
when
a
stranger
arrived
from
central
from
algeciras
the
stranger
told
him
swiftly
as
the
two
of
them
met
at
the
door
psychist
for
poprob
polasigned
special
overtake
barlow
thank
heaven
said
hawkins
barlow
he
told
the
man
from
the
past
this
is
he
going
to
take
care
of
you
and
help
you
make
lots
of
money
the
psychist
stayed
for
a
cup
of
the
coffee
whose
preparation
had
delighted
barlow
and
then
conducted
the
real
estate
man
down
the
corduroy
road
to
his
car
leaving
the
potter
to
speculate
on
whether
he
could
at
last
crack
his
kilns
hawkins
abruptly
dismissing
barlow
and
the
problem
happily
picked
the
chinking
from
around
the
door
of
the
number
two
kiln
prying
it
open
a
trifle
a
blast
of
heat
and
the
heady
smoky
scent
of
the
reduction
fire
delighted
him
he
peered
and
saw
a
corner
of
a
shelf
glowing
becoming
obscured
by
wavering
black
areas
as
it
lost
heat
through
the
opened
door
he
slipped
a
charred
wood
paddle
under
a
mug
on
the
shelf
and
pulled
it
out
as
a
sample
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
his
hand
curling
and
scorching
the
mug
crackled
and
pinged
and
hawkins
sighed
happily
the
bismuth
resinate
luster
had
fired
to
perfection
a
haunting
film
of
metal
with
strange
bluish
lights
in
it
as
it
turned
before
the
eyes
and
the
problem
of
population
seemed
very
far
away
to
hawkins
then
barlow
and
arrived
at
the
concrete
highway
where
the
psychist
car
was
parked
in
a
safety
bay
what
a
gasped
the
man
from
the
past
boat
no
that
my
car
barlow
surveyed
it
with
awe
lines
compound
curves
kilograms
of
chrome
he
ran
his
hands
futilely
over
the
door
or
was
it
the
door
in
a
futile
search
for
a
handle
and
asked
respectfully
how
fast
does
it
go
the
psychist
gave
him
a
keen
look
and
said
slowly
two
hundred
and
fifty
you
can
tell
by
the
speedometer
wow
my
old
chevvy
could
hit
a
hundred
on
a
straightaway
but
out
of
my
class
mister
somehow
got
a
huge
low
door
open
and
barlow
descended
three
steps
into
immense
cushions
floundering
over
to
the
right
he
was
too
fascinated
to
pay
serious
attention
to
his
flayed
dermis
the
dashboard
was
a
lovely
wilderness
of
dials
plugs
indicators
lights
scales
and
switches
the
psychist
climbed
down
into
the
driver
seat
and
did
something
with
his
feet
the
motor
started
like
lighting
a
blowtorch
as
big
as
a
silo
wallowing
around
in
the
cushions
barlow
saw
through
a
mirror
a
tremendous
exhaust
filled
with
brilliant
white
sparkles
do
you
like
it
yelled
the
psychist
it
terrific
barlow
yelled
back
it
he
was
shut
up
as
the
car
pulled
out
from
the
bay
into
the
road
with
a
great
a
gale
roared
past
barlow
head
though
the
windows
seemed
to
be
closed
the
impression
of
speed
was
terrific
he
located
the
speedometer
on
the
dashboard
and
saw
it
climb
past
fast
enough
for
me
yelled
the
psychist
noting
that
barlow
face
fell
in
response
radio
he
passed
over
a
surprisingly
light
object
like
a
football
helmet
with
no
trailing
wires
and
pointed
to
a
row
of
buttons
barlow
put
on
the
helmet
glad
to
have
the
roar
of
air
stilled
and
pushed
a
pushbutton
it
lit
up
satisfyingly
and
barlow
settled
back
even
farther
for
a
sample
of
the
brave
new
world
taste
in
ingenious
entertainment
take
it
and
stick
it
a
voice
roared
in
his
ears
he
snatched
off
the
helmet
and
gave
the
psychist
an
injured
look
grinned
and
turned
a
dial
associated
with
the
pushbutton
layout
the
man
from
the
past
donned
the
helmet
again
and
found
the
voice
had
lowered
to
normal
the
show
of
shows
the
the
show
the
quiz
of
quizzes
it
and
stick
it
there
were
shrieks
of
laughter
in
the
background

quarter
the
question
was
spoken
with
arch
significance
and
the
audience
shrieked
howled
and
whistled
its
appreciation
it
was
dull
listening
when
you
did
know
the
punch
lines
and
catch
lines
barlow
pushed
another
button
with
his
free
hand
ready
at

a

but
they
died
too
when
their
suits
turned
out
to
be
fulla
little
holes
and
here
is
a
bulletin
i
just
got
from
denver
it
seems
barlow
took
off
the
headset
uncomprehendingly
he
seemed
so
callous
he
yelled
at
the
driver
i
was
listening
to
a
newscast
shook
his
head
and
pointed
at
his
ears
the
roar
of
air
was
deafening
barlow
frowned
baffledly
and
stared
out
of
the
window
a
glowing
sign
said
moogs
would
you
buy
it
for
a
quarter
he
did
know
what
moogs
was
or
were
the
illustration
showed
an
incredibly
proportioned
girl
per
cent
naked
writhing
passionately
in
animated
full
color
the
roadside
jingle
was
still
with
him
but
with
a
new
feature
radar
or
something
spotted
the
car
and
alerted
the
lines
of
the
jingle
each
in
turn
sped
along
a
roadside
track
even
with
the
car
so
it
could
be
read
before
the
next
line
was
alerted
if
there
a
girl
you
want
to
get
deflocculize
unromantic
sweat
another
animated
job
in
two
panels
the
familiar
before
and
after
the
first
said
just
any
cigar
and
was
illustrated
with
a
domestic
tragedy
of
a
wife
holding
her
nose
while
her
coarse
and
husband
puffed
a
rope
the
second
panel
glowed
or
a
vuelta
abajo
and
was
illustrated
with
barlow
blushed
and
looked
at
his
feet
until
they
had
passed
the
sign
coming
into
chicago
bawled
other
cars
were
showing
up
all
of
them
dreamboats
watching
them
barlow
began
to
wonder
if
he
knew
what
a
kilometer
was
exactly
they
seemed
to
be
traveling
so
slowly
if
you
ignored
the
roaring
air
past
your
ears
and
did
let
the
speedy
lines
of
the
dreamboats
fool
you
he
would
have
sworn
they
were
really
crawling
along
at
with
occasional
spurts
up
to
thirty
how
much
was
a
kilometer
anyway
the
city
loomed
ahead
and
it
was
just
what
it
ought
to
be
towering
skyscrapers
overhead
ramps
landing
platforms
for
helicopters
he
clutched
at
the
cushions
those
two
they
were
going
to
they
were
going
to
they
he
did
see
what
happened
because
their
apparent
collision
courses
took
them
behind
a
giant
building
screamingly
sweet
blasts
of
sound
surrounded
them
as
they
stopped
for
a
red
light
what
the
hell
is
going
on
here
said
barlow
in
a
shrill
frightened
voice
because
the
braking
time
was
just
about
zero
he
was
hurled
against
the
dashboard
who
kidding
who
why
what
the
matter
demanded
the
driver
the
light
changed
to
green
and
he
started
the
pickup
barlow
stiffened
as
he
realized
that
the
rush
of
air
past
his
ears
began
just
a
brief
unreal
before
the
car
was
actually
moving
he
grabbed
for
the
door
handle
on
his
side
the
city
grew
on
them
slowly
scattered
buildings
denser
buildings
taller
buildings
and
a
red
light
ahead
the
car
rolled
to
a
stop
in
zero
braking
time
the
rush
of
air
cut
off
an
instant
after
it
stopped
and
barlow
was
out
of
the
car
and
running
frenziedly
down
a
sidewalk
one
instant
after
that
track
me
he
thought
panting
a
secret
police
thing
they
get
you
machines
television
eyes
everywhere
afraid
you
tell
their
slaves
about
freedom
and
stuff
they
do
let
anybody
cross
them
like
that
story
i
once
winded
he
slowed
to
a
walk
and
congratulated
himself
that
he
had
guts
enough
not
to
turn
around
that
was
what
they
always
watched
for
walking
he
was
just
another
back
among
hundreds
he
would
be
safe
he
would
be
safe
a
hand
tumbled
from
a
large
coarse
handsome
face
thrust
close
to
his
wassamatta
bumpinninna
people
likeya
owna
sidewalk
got
ta
miner
slamya
inna
mushya
bassar
it
was
neither
the
mad
potter
nor
the
mad
driver
excuse
me
said
barlow
what
did
you
say
oh
yeah
yelled
the
stranger
dangerously
and
waited
for
an
answer
barlow
with
the
feeling
that
he
had
somehow
been
suckered
into
the
short
end
of
an
intricate
deal
heard
himself
reply
belligerently
yeah
the
stranger
let
go
of
his
shoulder
and
snarled
oh
yeah
yeah
said
barlow
yanking
his
jacket
back
into
shape
aaah
snarled
the
stranger
with
more
contempt
and
disgust
than
ferocity
he
added
an
obscenity
current
in
barlow
time
a
standard
but
physiologically
impossible
directive
and
strutted
off
hulking
his
shoulders
and
balling
his
fists
barlow
walked
on
trembling
evidently
he
had
handled
it
well
enough
he
stopped
at
a
red
light
while
the
long
low
dreamboats
roared
before
him
and
pedestrians
in
the
sidewalk
flow
with
him
threaded
their
ways
through
the
stream
of
cars
brakes
screamed
fenders
clanged
and
dented
hoarse
cries
flew
back
and
forth
between
drivers
and
walkers
he
leaped
backward
frantically
as
one
car
swerved
over
an
arc
of
sidewalk
to
miss
another
the
signal
changed
to
green
the
cars
kept
on
coming
for
about
thirty
seconds
and
then
dwindled
to
an
occasional
barlow
crossed
warily
and
leaned
against
a
vending
machine
blowing
big
breaths
he
told
himself
something
normal
buy
something
from
the
he
fumbled
out
some
change
got
a
newspaper
for
a
dime
a
handkerchief
for
a
quarter
and
a
candy
bar
for
another
quarter
the
faint
chocolate
smell
made
him
ravenous
suddenly
he
clawed
at
the
glassy
wrapper
printed
crigglies
quite
futilely
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
it
divided
neatly
by
itself
the
bar
made
three
good
bites
and
he
bought
two
more
and
gobbled
them
down
thirsty
he
drew
a
carbonated
orange
drink
in
another
one
of
the
glassy
wrappers
from
the
machine
for
another
dime
when
he
fumbled
with
it
it
divided
neatly
and
spilled
all
over
his
knees
barlow
decided
he
had
been
there
long
enough
and
walked
on
the
shop
windows
were
shop
windows
people
still
wore
and
bought
clothes
still
smoked
and
bought
tobacco
still
ate
and
bought
food
and
they
still
went
to
the
movies
he
saw
with
pleased
surprise
as
he
passed
and
then
returned
to
a
glittering
place
whose
sign
said
it
was
the
bijou
the
place
seemed
to
be
showing
a
quintuple
feature
are
have
and
canali
it
was
irresistible
he
paid
a
dollar
and
went
in
he
caught
the
of
canali
in
production
it
appeared
to
be
an
interplanetary
saga
winding
up
with
a
chase
scene
and
a
reconciliation
between
estranged
hero
and
heroine
are
and
have
were
fantastic
arguments
against
parenthood
the
grotesquely
exaggerated
dangers
of
painfully
graphic
childbirth
vicious
children
old
parents
beaten
and
starved
by
their
sadistic
offspring
the
audience
barlow
astoundedly
noted
was
placidly
champing
sweets
and
showing
no
particular
signs
of
revulsion
the
drove
him
into
the
lobby
the
fanfares
were
shattering
the
blazing
colors
blinding
and
the
added
scents
when
his
eyes
again
became
accustomed
to
the
moderate
lighting
of
the
lobby
he
groped
his
way
to
a
bench
and
opened
the
newspaper
he
had
bought
it
turned
out
to
be
racing
which
afflicted
him
with
a
crushing
sense
of
loss
the
familiar
boxed
index
in
the
lower
left
hand
corner
of
the
front
page
showed
almost
unbearably
that
churchill
downs
and
empire
city
were
still
in
business
blinking
back
tears
he
turned
to
the
past
performances
at
churchill
they
were
using
abbreviations
any
more
and
the
pages
because
of
that
were
instead
of
double
but
it
was
all
the
same
or
was
it
he
squinted
at
the
first
race
a
maiden
claimer
for
thirteen
hundred
dollars
incredibly
the
track
record
was
two
minutes
ten
and
seconds
any
beetle
in
his
time
could
have
knocked
off
the
in
it
was
the
same
for
the
other
distances
much
worse
for
route
events
the
hell
had
happened
to
everything
he
studied
the
form
of
a
brown
mare
in
the
second
and
could
make
head
or
tail
of
it
she
won
and
lost
and
placed
and
showed
and
lost
and
placed
without
rhyme
or
reason
she
looked
like
a
for
a
couple
of
races
and
then
she
looked
like
a
pig
and
then
she
looked
like
a
mudder
but
the
next
time
it
rained
she
was
and
then
she
was
a
stayer
and
then
she
was
a
pig
again
in
a
good
allowances
event
too
barlow
looked
at
the
other
entries
and
it
slowly
dawned
on
him
that
they
were
all
like
the
brown
mare
not
a
single
damned
horse
running
had
the
slightest
trace
of
class
somebody
sat
down
beside
him
and
said
that
the
story
barlow
whirled
to
his
feet
and
saw
it
was
his
driver
i
was
in
doubts
about
telling
you
said
the
psychist
but
i
see
you
have
some
growing
suspicions
of
the
truth
please
do
get
excited
it
all
right
i
tell
you
so
you
got
me
said
barlow
you
do
pretend
i
can
put
two
and
two
together
you
the
secret
police
you
and
the
rest
of
the
aristocrats
live
in
luxury
on
the
sweat
of
these
oppressed
slaves
you
afraid
of
me
because
you
have
to
keep
them
ignorant
there
was
a
bellow
of
bright
laughter
from
the
psychist
that
got
them
blank
looks
from
other
patrons
of
the
lobby
the
laughter
did
sound
at
all
sinister
let
get
out
of
here
said
still
chuckling
you
could
possibly
have
it
more
wrong
he
engaged
barlow
arm
and
led
him
to
the
street
the
actual
truth
is
that
the
millions
of
workers
live
in
luxury
on
the
sweat
of
the
handful
of
aristocrats
i
shall
probably
die
before
my
time
of
overwork
unless
he
gave
barlow
a
speculative
look
you
may
be
able
to
help
us
i
know
that
gag
sneered
barlow
i
made
money
in
my
time
and
to
make
money
you
have
to
get
people
on
your
side
go
ahead
and
shoot
me
if
you
want
but
you
not
going
to
make
a
fool
out
of
me
you
nasty
little
ingrate
snapped
the
psychist
with
a
kaleidoscopic
change
of
mood
this
damned
mess
is
all
your
fault
and
the
fault
of
people
like
you
now
come
along
and
no
more
of
your
nonsense
he
yanked
barlow
into
an
office
building
lobby
and
an
elevator
that
disconcertingly
went
loudly
as
it
rose
the
real
estate
knees
were
wobbly
as
the
psychist
pushed
him
from
the
elevator
down
a
corridor
and
into
an
office
a
man
rose
from
a
plain
chair
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
after
an
angry
look
at
barlow
he
asked
the
psychist
was
i
called
from
the
pole
to
inspect
this
this
unget
updandered
i
etfind
quasichance
exhim
poprobattackline
said
the
psychist
soothingly
doubt
grunted
the
man
try
suggested
very
well
barlow
i
understand
you
and
your
lamented
had
no
children
what
of
it
this
of
it
you
were
a
blind
selfish
stupid
ass
to
tolerate
economic
and
social
conditions
which
penalized
by
the
prudent
and
foresighted
you
made
us
what
we
are
today
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
we
are
far
from
satisfied
rockets
automobiles
cities
with
overhead
ramps
as
far
as
i
can
see
said
barlow
you
running
down
the
best
features
of
time
are
you
crazy
the
rockets
are
rockets
they
good
but
the
fancy
shell
around
them
makes
for
a
bad
drag
the
automobiles
have
a
top
speed
of
one
hundred
kilometers
per
hour
a
kilometer
is
if
i
recall
my
paleolinguistics
of
a
mile
and
the
speedometers
are
all
rigged
accordingly
so
the
drivers
will
think
they
going
two
hundred
and
fifty
the
cities
are
ridiculous
expensive
unsanitary
wasteful
conglomerations
of
people
be
better
off
and
more
productive
if
they
were
spread
over
the
countryside
we
need
the
rockets
and
trick
speedometers
and
cities
because
while
you
and
your
kind
were
being
prudent
and
foresighted
and
not
having
children
the
migrant
workers
slum
dwellers
and
tenant
farmers
were
shiftlessly
and
having
children
breeding
breeding
my
god
how
they
bred
wait
a
minute
objected
barlow
there
were
lots
of
people
in
our
crowd
who
had
two
or
three
children
the
attrition
of
accidents
illness
wars
and
such
took
care
of
that
your
intelligence
was
bred
out
it
is
gone
children
that
should
have
been
born
never
were
the
majority
took
over
the
population
the
average
iq
now
is
but
that
far
in
the
future
so
are
you
grunted
the
man
sourly
but
who
are
people
just
people
real
people
some
generations
ago
the
geneticists
realized
at
last
that
nobody
was
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
what
they
said
so
they
abandoned
words
for
deeds
specifically
they
formed
and
recruited
for
a
closed
corporation
intended
to
maintain
and
improve
the
breed
we
are
their
descendants
about
three
million
of
us
there
are
five
billion
of
the
others
so
we
are
their
slaves
during
the
past
couple
of
years
i
designed
a
skyscraper
kept
billings
memorial
hospital
here
in
chicago
running
headed
off
war
with
mexico
and
directed
traffic
at
laguardia
field
in
new
york
i
do
understand
why
do
you
let
them
go
to
hell
in
their
own
way
the
man
grimaced
we
tried
it
once
for
three
months
we
holed
up
at
the
south
pole
and
waited
they
did
notice
it
some
people
were
missing
some
chief
nurses
did
show
up
minor
government
people
on
the
level
could
be
located
it
did
seem
to
matter
in
a
week
there
was
hunger
in
two
weeks
there
were
famine
and
plague
in
three
weeks
war
and
anarchy
we
called
off
the
experiment
it
took
us
most
of
the
next
generation
to
get
things
squared
away
again
but
why
you
let
them
kill
each
other
off
five
billion
corpses
mean
about
five
hundred
million
tons
of
rotting
flesh
barlow
had
another
idea
why
do
you
sterilize
them
two
and
billion
operations
is
a
lot
of
operations
because
they
breed
continuously
the
job
would
never
be
done
i
see
like
the
marching
chinese
who
the
devil
are
they
it
was
a
uh
paradox
of
my
time
somebody
figured
out
that
if
all
the
chinese
in
the
world
were
to
line
up
four
abreast
i
think
it
was
and
start
marching
past
a
given
point
they
never
stop
because
of
the
babies
that
would
be
born
and
grow
up
before
they
passed
the
point
that
right
only
instead
of
given
point
make
it
largest
conceivable
number
of
operating
rooms
that
we
could
build
and
staff
there
could
never
be
enough
say
said
barlow
those
movies
about
babies
was
that
your
propaganda
it
was
it
does
seem
to
mean
a
thing
to
them
we
have
abandoned
the
idea
of
attempting
propaganda
contrary
to
a
biological
drive
so
if
you
work
a
biological
drive
i
know
of
none
which
is
consistent
with
inhibition
of
fertility
barlow
face
went
the
result
of
years
of
careful
discipline
you
do
huh
you
the
great
brains
and
you
think
of
any
why
no
said
the
psychist
innocently
can
you
that
depends
i
sold
ten
thousand
acres
of
siberian
tundra
through
a
dummy
firm
of
course
after
the
partition
of
russia
the
buyers
thought
they
were
getting
improved
building
lots
on
the
outskirts
of
kiev
i
say
that
was
a
lot
tougher
than
this
job
how
so
asked
the
man
those
were
normal
suspicious
customers
and
these
are
morons
born
suckers
you
just
figure
out
a
con
they
fall
for
they
wo
know
enough
to
do
any
smart
checking
the
psychist
and
the
man
had
also
had
training
they
kept
themselves
from
looking
with
sudden
hope
at
each
other
you
seem
to
have
something
in
mind
said
the
psychist
barlow
poker
face
went
blanker
still
maybe
i
have
i
have
heard
any
offer
yet
there
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
you
prevented
resources
from
being
so
plundered
the
man
pointed
out
that
the
race
will
soon
become
extinct
i
do
know
that
barlow
said
bluntly
all
i
have
is
your
word
if
you
really
have
a
method
i
do
think
any
price
would
be
too
great
the
psychist
offered
money
said
barlow
all
you
want
more
than
you
want
the
man
corrected
prestige
added
barlow
plenty
of
publicity
my
picture
and
my
name
in
the
papers
and
over
tv
every
day
statues
to
me
parks
and
cities
and
streets
and
other
things
named
after
me
a
whole
chapter
in
the
history
books
the
psychist
made
a
facial
sign
to
the
man
that
meant
oh
brother
the
man
signaled
back
steady
boy
it
not
too
much
to
ask
the
psychist
agreed
barlow
sensing
a
seller
market
said
power
power
the
man
repeated
puzzledly
your
own
hydro
station
or
nuclear
pile
i
mean
a
world
dictatorship
with
me
as
dictator
well
now
said
the
psychist
but
the
man
interrupted
it
would
take
a
special
emergency
act
of
congress
but
the
situation
warrants
it
i
think
that
can
be
guaranteed
could
you
give
us
some
indication
of
your
plan
the
psychist
asked
ever
hear
of
lemmings
no
they
are
were
i
guess
since
you
have
heard
of
them
little
animals
in
norway
and
every
few
years
they
swarm
to
the
coast
and
swim
out
to
sea
until
they
drowned
i
figure
on
putting
some
lemming
urge
into
the
population
how
i
save
that
till
i
get
the
right
signatures
on
the
deal
the
man
said
i
like
to
work
with
you
on
it
barlow
my
name
he
put
out
his
hand
barlow
looked
closely
at
the
hand
then
at
the
man
face
ryan
what
ngana
that
sounds
like
an
african
name
it
is
my
mother
father
was
a
watusi
barlow
did
take
the
hand
i
thought
you
looked
pretty
dark
i
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
but
i
do
think
i
be
at
my
best
working
with
you
there
must
be
somebody
else
just
as
well
qualified
i
sure
the
psychist
made
a
facial
sign
to
that
meant
steady
boy
very
well
told
barlow
we
see
what
arrangement
can
be
made
it
not
that
i
prejudiced
you
understand
some
of
my
best
friends
barlow
do
give
it
another
thought
anybody
who
could
pick
on
the
lemming
analogy
is
going
to
be
useful
to
us
and
so
he
would
thought
alone
in
the
office
after
had
taken
barlow
up
to
the
helicopter
stage
so
he
would
poprob
had
exhausted
every
rational
attempt
and
the
new
poprobattacklines
would
have
to
be
irrational
or
this
creature
from
the
past
with
his
lemming
legends
and
his
improved
building
lots
would
be
a
fountain
of
precious
vicious
sighed
and
stretched
he
had
to
go
and
run
the
san
francisco
subway
summoned
early
from
the
pole
to
study
barlow
left
unfinished
a
nice
little
theorem
between
interruptions
he
was
slowly
constructing
an
geometry
whose
foundations
and
superstructure
owed
no
debt
whatsoever
to
intuition
upstairs
waiting
for
a
helicopter
barlow
was
explaining
to
that
he
had
nothing
against
negroes
and
wished
he
had
some
of
imperturbability
and
humor
for
the
ordeal
the
helicopter
took
them
to
international
airport
where
explained
barlow
would
leave
for
the
pole
the
man
from
the
past
was
sure
he
like
a
dreary
waste
of
ice
and
cold
it
all
right
said
the
psychist
a
civilized
layout
warm
pleasant
you
be
able
to
work
more
efficiently
there
all
the
facts
at
your
fingertips
a
good
secretary
i
need
a
pretty
big
staff
said
barlow
who
had
learned
from
thousands
of
deals
never
to
take
the
first
offer
i
meant
a
private
confidential
one
said
readily
but
you
can
have
as
many
as
you
want
you
naturally
have
priority
if
you
really
have
a
workable
plan
let
not
forget
this
dictatorship
angle
said
barlow
he
did
know
that
the
psychist
would
just
as
readily
have
promised
him
deification
to
get
him
happily
on
the
rocket
for
the
pole
had
no
wish
to
be
torn
limb
from
limb
he
knew
very
well
that
it
would
end
that
way
if
the
population
learned
from
this
anachronism
that
there
was
a
small
elite
which
considered
itself
head
shoulders
trunk
and
groin
above
the
rest
the
fact
that
this
assumption
was
perfectly
true
and
the
fact
that
the
elite
was
condemned
by
its
superiority
to
a
life
of
the
most
grinding
toil
would
not
be
considered
the
difference
would
the
psychist
finally
put
barlow
aboard
the
rocket
with
some
thirty
people
real
people
headed
for
the
pole
barlow
was
airsick
all
the
way
because
of
a
suggestion
had
planted
in
him
one
idea
was
to
make
him
as
averse
as
possible
to
a
return
trip
and
another
idea
was
to
spare
the
other
passengers
from
his
aggressive
talkative
company
barlow
during
the
first
day
at
the
pole
was
reminded
of
his
first
day
in
the
army
it
was
the
same
business
until
he
took
a
firm
line
with
them
then
instead
of
acting
like
supply
sergeants
they
acted
like
hotel
clerks
it
was
a
wonderful
wonderfully
calculated
buildup
and
one
that
he
failed
to
suspect
after
all
in
his
time
a
visitor
from
the
past
would
have
been
lionized
at
day
end
he
reclined
in
a
snug
underground
billet
with
the
gales
roaring
yards
overhead
and
tried
to
put
two
and
two
together
it
was
like
old
times
he
thought
like
a
coup
in
real
estate
where
you
had
the
competition
by
the
throat
like
a
cent
rent
boost
when
you
knew
damned
well
there
was
no
place
for
the
tenants
to
move
like
smiling
when
you
read
over
the
breakfast
orange
juice
that
the
city
council
had
decided
to
build
a
school
on
the
ground
you
had
acquired
by
a
deal
with
the
city
council
and
it
was
simple
he
would
just
sell
tundra
building
lots
to
eagerly
suicidal
lemmings
and
that
was
absolutely
all
there
was
to
solving
the
problem
that
had
these
spinning
they
have
to
work
out
most
of
the
details
naturally
but
what
the
hell
that
was
what
subordinates
were
for
he
need
specialists
in
advertising
engineering
communications
did
they
know
anything
about
hypnotism
that
might
be
helpful
if
not
there
have
to
be
a
lot
of
bribery
done
but
he
make
sure
damned
sure
there
were
unlimited
funds
just
selling
building
lots
to
lemmings
he
wished
as
he
fell
asleep
that
poor
verna
could
have
been
in
on
this
it
was
his
biggest
most
stupendous
deal
verna
that
sharp
shyster
sam
immerman
must
have
swindled
her
it
began
the
next
day
with
people
coming
to
visit
him
he
knew
the
approach
they
merely
wanted
to
be
helpful
to
their
illustrious
visitor
from
the
past
and
would
he
help
fill
them
in
about
his
era
which
unfortunately
was
somewhat
obscure
historically
and
what
did
he
think
could
be
done
about
the
problem
he
told
them
he
was
too
old
to
be
roped
any
more
and
they
would
get
any
information
out
of
him
until
he
got
a
letter
of
intent
from
at
least
the
polar
president
and
a
session
of
the
polar
congress
empowered
to
make
him
dictator
he
got
the
letter
and
the
session
he
presented
his
program
was
asked
whether
his
conscience
did
revolt
at
its
callousness
explained
succinctly
that
a
deal
was
a
deal
and
anybody
who
was
smart
enough
to
protect
himself
did
deserve
protection
caveat
emptor
he
threw
in
for
scholarship
and
had
to
translate
it
to
let
the
buyer
beware
he
did
he
stated
give
a
damn
about
either
the
morons
or
their
intelligent
slaves
he
told
them
his
price
and
that
was
all
he
was
interested
in
would
they
meet
it
or
would
they
the
polar
president
offered
to
resign
in
his
favor
with
certain
temporary
emergency
powers
that
the
polar
congress
would
vote
him
if
he
thought
them
necessary
barlow
demanded
the
title
of
world
dictator
complete
control
of
world
finances
salary
to
be
decided
by
himself
and
the
publicity
campaign
and
historical
writeup
to
begin
at
once
as
for
the
emergency
powers
he
added
they
are
neither
to
be
temporary
nor
limited
somebody
wanted
the
floor
to
discuss
the
matter
with
the
declared
hope
that
perhaps
barlow
would
modify
his
demands
you
got
the
proposition
barlow
said
i
not
knocking
off
even
ten
per
cent
but
what
if
the
congress
refuses
sir
the
president
asked
then
you
can
stay
up
here
at
the
pole
and
try
to
work
it
out
yourselves
i
get
what
i
want
from
the
morons
a
shrewd
operator
like
me
does
have
to
compromise
i
have
got
a
single
competitor
in
this
whole
cockeyed
moronic
era
congress
waived
debate
and
voted
by
show
of
hands
barlow
won
unanimously
you
do
know
how
close
you
came
to
losing
me
he
said
in
his
first
official
address
to
the
joint
houses
i
not
the
boy
to
haggle
either
i
get
what
i
ask
or
i
go
elsewhere
the
first
thing
i
want
is
to
see
designs
for
a
new
palace
for
me
nothing
either
and
your
best
painters
and
sculptors
to
start
working
on
my
portraits
and
statues
meanwhile
i
get
my
staff
together
he
dismissed
the
polar
president
and
the
polar
congress
telling
them
that
he
let
them
know
when
the
next
meeting
would
be
a
week
later
the
program
started
with
north
america
the
first
target
garvy
was
resting
after
dinner
before
the
ordeal
of
turning
on
the
dishwasher
the
tv
of
course
was
on
and
it
said
oooh
long
shuddery
and
ecstatic
the
cue
for
the
assault
spot
commercial
girls
said
the
announcer
hoarsely
do
you
want
your
man
it
easy
to
get
him
easy
as
a
trip
to
venus
huh
said
garvy
wassamatter
snorted
her
husband
starting
out
of
a
doze
ja
hear
that
wha
he
said
like
a
trip
to
venus
so
well
i
thought
ya
could
get
to
venus
i
thought
they
just
had
that
one
rocket
thing
that
crashed
on
the
moon
aah
women
do
keep
up
with
the
news
said
garvy
righteously
subsiding
again
oh
said
his
wife
uncertainly
and
the
next
day
on
other
there
was
a
new
character
who
had
just
breezed
in
buzz
rentshaw
master
rocket
pilot
of
the
venus
run
on
other
the
broadcast
drama
about
you
and
your
neighbors
people
people
people
garvy
listened
with
amazement
over
a
cooling
cup
of
coffee
as
buzz
made
hay
of
her
hazy
convictions
mona
darling
it
so
good
to
see
you
again
buzz
you
do
know
how
i
missed
you
on
that
dreary
venus
run
sound
blind
run
down
key
turned
in
door
mona
was
it
dull
dearest
buzz
let
not
talk
about
my
humdrum
job
darling
let
talk
about
us
sound
well
the
program
was
back
to
normal
at
last
that
evening
garvy
tried
to
ask
again
whether
her
husband
was
sure
about
those
rockets
but
he
was
dozing
right
through
it
and
stick
so
she
watched
the
screen
and
forgot
the
puzzle
she
was
still
rocking
with
laughter
at
the
gag
line
would
you
buy
it
for
a
quarter
when
the
commercial
went
on
for
the
detergent
powder
she
always
faithfully
loaded
her
dishwasher
with
on
the
first
of
every
month
the
announcer
displayed
mountains
of
suds
from
a
tiny
piece
of
the
stuff
and
coyly
added
of
course
cleano
do
lay
around
for
you
to
pick
up
like
the
soap
root
on
venus
but
it
pretty
cheap
and
almost
pretty
near
just
as
good
so
for
us
plain
folks
who
ai
lucky
enough
to
live
up
there
on
venus
cleano
is
the
real
cleaning
stuff
then
the
chorus
went
into
their
jingle
but
garvy
did
hear
it
she
was
a
stubborn
woman
but
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
very
sick
indeed
she
did
want
to
worry
her
husband
the
next
day
she
quietly
made
an
appointment
with
her
family
freud
in
the
waiting
room
she
picked
up
a
fresh
new
copy
of
and
put
it
down
with
a
faint
palpitation
the
lead
article
according
to
the
table
of
contents
on
the
cover
was
titled
the
most
memorable
venusian
i
ever
met
the
freud
will
see
you
now
said
the
nurse
and
garvy
tottered
into
his
office
his
traditional
glasses
and
whiskers
were
reassuring
she
choked
out
the
ritual
freud
forgive
me
for
i
have
neuroses
he
chanted
the
antiphonal
tut
my
dear
girl
what
seems
to
be
the
trouble
i
got
like
a
hole
in
the
head
she
quavered
i
seem
to
forget
all
kinds
of
things
things
like
everybody
seems
to
know
and
i
do
well
that
happens
to
everybody
occasionally
my
dear
i
suggest
a
vacation
on
venus
the
freud
stared
at
the
empty
chair
his
nurse
came
in
and
demanded
hey
you
see
how
she
scrammed
what
was
the
matter
with
he
took
off
his
glasses
and
whiskers
meditatively
you
can
search
me
i
told
her
she
should
maybe
try
a
vacation
on
venus
a
momentary
bafflement
came
into
his
face
and
he
dug
through
his
desk
drawers
until
he
found
a
copy
of
the
profusely
illustrated
journal
of
his
profession
it
had
come
that
morning
and
he
had
it
though
looking
mostly
at
the
pictures
he
leafed
through
to
the
article
of
the
planet
venus
in
rest
it
right
there
he
said
the
nurse
looked
it
sure
is
she
agreed
why
should
it
be
the
trouble
with
these
here
neurotics
decided
the
freud
is
that
they
all
the
time
got
to
fight
reality
show
in
the
next
twitch
he
put
on
his
glasses
and
whiskers
again
and
forgot
garvy
and
her
strange
behavior
freud
forgive
me
for
i
have
neuroses
tut
my
dear
girl
what
seems
to
be
the
trouble
like
many
cures
of
mental
disorders
garvy
was
achieved
largely
by
she
disciplined
herself
sternly
out
of
the
crazy
notion
that
there
had
been
only
one
rocket
ship
and
that
one
a
failure
she
could
join
without
wincing
eventually
in
any
conversation
on
the
desirability
of
venus
as
a
place
to
retire
on
its
fabulous
floral
profusion
finally
she
went
to
venus
all
her
friends
were
trying
to
book
passage
with
the
evening
star
travel
and
real
estate
corporation
but
naturally
the
demand
was
crushing
she
considered
herself
lucky
to
get
a
seat
at
last
for
the
summer
cruise
the
space
ship
took
off
from
a
place
called
los
alamos
new
mexico
it
looked
just
like
all
the
spaceships
on
television
and
in
the
picture
magazines
but
was
more
comfortable
than
you
would
expect
garvy
was
delighted
with
the
fifty
or
so
assembled
before
takeoff
they
were
from
all
over
the
country
and
she
had
a
distinct
impression
that
they
were
on
the
brainy
side
the
captain
a
tall
impressive
fellow
named
or
other
welcomed
them
aboard
and
trusted
that
their
trip
would
be
a
memorable
one
he
regretted
that
there
would
be
nothing
to
see
because
due
to
the
meteorite
season
the
ports
would
be
dogged
down
it
was
disappointing
yet
reassuring
that
the
line
was
taking
no
chances
there
was
the
expected
momentary
discomfort
at
takeoff
and
then
two
monotonous
days
of
droning
travel
through
space
to
be
whiled
away
in
the
lounge
at
cards
or
craps
the
landing
was
a
routine
bump
and
the
voyagers
were
issued
tablets
to
swallow
to
immunize
them
against
any
minor
ailments
when
the
tablets
took
effect
the
lock
was
opened
and
venus
was
theirs
it
looked
much
like
a
tropical
island
on
earth
except
for
a
blanket
of
cloud
overhead
but
it
had
a
heady
quality
that
was
intoxicating
and
glamorous
the
ten
days
of
the
vacation
were
suffused
with
a
hazy
magic
the
soap
root
as
advertised
was
free
and
sudsy
the
fruits
mostly
tropical
varieties
transplanted
from
earth
were
delightful
the
simple
shelters
provided
by
the
travel
company
were
more
than
adequate
for
the
balmy
days
and
nights
it
was
with
sincere
regret
that
the
voyagers
filed
again
into
the
ship
and
swallowed
more
tablets
doled
out
to
counteract
and
sterilize
any
venus
illnesses
they
might
unwittingly
communicate
to
earth
vacationing
was
one
thing
power
politics
was
another
at
the
pole
a
small
man
was
in
a
soundproof
room
his
face
deathly
pale
and
his
body
limp
in
a
straight
chair
in
the
american
senate
chamber
senator
n
cal
was
saying
president
and
gentlemen
i
would
be
remiss
in
my
duty
as
a
legislature
i
did
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
body
i
see
here
a
perilous
situation
which
is
fraught
with
peril
as
is
well
known
to
members
of
this
body
the
perfection
of
space
flight
has
brought
with
it
a
situation
i
can
only
describe
as
fraught
with
peril
president
and
gentlemen
now
that
swift
american
rockets
now
traverse
the
trackless
void
of
space
between
this
planet
and
our
nearest
planetarial
neighbor
in
space
and
gentlemen
i
refer
to
venus
the
star
of
dawn
the
brightest
jewel
in
fair
diadome
now
i
say
i
want
to
inquire
what
steps
are
being
taken
to
colonize
venus
with
a
vanguard
of
patriotic
citizens
like
those
minutemen
of
yore
president
and
gentlemen
there
are
in
this
world
nations
envious
nations
i
do
not
name
mexico
who
by
fair
means
or
foul
may
seek
to
wrest
from
columbia
grasp
the
torch
of
freedom
of
space
nations
whose
low
living
standards
and
innate
depravity
give
them
an
unfair
advantage
over
the
citizens
of
our
fair
republic
this
is
my
program
i
suggest
that
a
city
of
more
than
population
be
selected
by
lot
the
citizens
of
the
fortunate
city
are
to
be
awarded
choice
lands
on
venus
free
and
clear
to
have
and
to
hold
and
convey
to
their
descendants
and
the
national
government
shall
provide
free
transportation
to
venus
for
these
citizens
and
this
program
shall
continue
city
by
city
until
there
has
been
deposited
on
venus
a
sufficient
vanguard
of
citizens
to
protect
our
manifest
rights
in
that
planet
objections
will
be
raised
for
carping
critics
we
have
always
with
us
they
will
say
there
is
enough
steel
they
will
call
it
a
cheap
giveaway
i
say
there
enough
steel
for
city
population
to
be
transferred
to
venus
and
that
is
all
that
is
needed
for
when
the
time
comes
for
the
second
city
to
be
transferred
the
first
emptied
city
can
be
wrecked
for
the
needed
steel
and
is
it
a
giveaway
yes
it
is
the
most
glorious
giveaway
in
the
history
of
mankind
president
and
gentlemen
there
is
no
time
to
waste
venus
must
be
american
at
the
pole
opened
his
eyes
and
said
feebly
the
style
was
a
little
uneven
do
you
think
anybody
notice
you
did
fine
boy
just
fine
barlow
reassured
him
bill
became
law
drafting
machines
at
the
south
pole
were
busy
around
the
clock
and
the
pittsburgh
steel
mills
spewed
millions
of
plates
into
the
los
alamos
spaceport
of
the
evening
star
travel
and
real
estate
corporation
it
was
going
to
be
los
angeles
for
logistic
reasons
and
the
three
most
accomplished
went
to
washington
and
mingled
in
the
crowd
at
the
drawing
to
make
certain
that
the
los
angeles
capsule
slithered
into
the
fingers
of
the
senator
los
angeles
loved
the
idea
and
a
forest
of
spaceships
began
to
blossom
in
the
desert
they
were
very
good
space
ships
but
they
did
have
to
be
a
team
at
the
pole
worked
at
barlow
direction
on
a
mail
setup
there
would
have
to
be
letters
to
and
from
venus
to
keep
the
slightest
taint
of
suspicion
from
arising
luckily
barlow
remembered
that
the
problem
had
been
solved
once
before
by
hitler
relatives
of
persons
incinerated
in
the
furnaces
of
lublin
or
majdanek
continued
to
get
cheery
postal
cards
the
los
angeles
flight
went
off
on
schedule
under
tremendous
press
newsreel
and
television
coverage
the
world
cheered
the
gallant
angelenos
who
were
setting
off
on
their
patriotic
voyage
to
the
land
of
milk
and
honey
the
forest
of
spaceships
thundered
up
and
up
and
out
of
sight
without
untoward
incident
billions
envied
the
angelenos
cramped
and
on
short
rations
though
they
were
wreckers
from
san
francisco
whose
capsule
came
up

moved
immediately
into
the
city
of
the
angels
for
the
scrap

their
own

would
require

constituents
could
do
no
less
the
president
of
mexico
hypnotically
alarmed
at
this
extension
of
beyond
the
stratosphere
launched
his
own
program
across
the
water
it
was
england
versus
ireland
france
versus
germany
china
versus
russia
india
versus
indonesia
ancient
hatreds
grew
into
the
flames
that
were

daily
dear
ed
how
are
you
sam
and
i
are
fine
and
hope
you
are
fine
is
it
nice
up
there
like
they
say
with
food
and
close
grone
on
trees
i
drove
by
springfield
yesterday
and
it
sure
looked
funny
all
the
buildings
down
but
of
coarse
it
is
worth
it
we
have
to
keep
the
greasers
in
their
place
do
you
have
any
truble
with
them
on
venus
drop
me
a
line
some
time
your
loving
sister
alma
dear
alma
i
am
fine
and
hope
you
are
fine
it
is
a
fine
place
here
fine
climate
and
easy
living
the
doctor
told
me
today
that
i
seem
to
be
ten
years
younger
he
thinks
there
is
something
in
the
air
here
keeps
people
young
we
do
not
have
much
trouble
with
the
greasers
here
they
keep
to
theirselves
it
is
just
a
question
of
us
outnumbering
them
and
staking
out
the
best
places
for
the
americans
in
south
bay
i
know
a
nice
little
island
that
i
have
been
saving
for
you
and
sam
with
lots
of
blanket
trees
and
ham
bushes
hoping
to
see
you
and
sam
soon
your
loving
brother
ed
sam
and
alma
were
on
their
way
shortly
poprob
got
a
dividend
in
every
nation
after
the
emigration
had
passed
the
halfway
mark
the
lonesome
were
unable
to
bear
the
melancholy
of
a
low
population
density
their
conditioning
had
been
to
swarms
of
their
kin
after
that
point
it
was
possible
to
foist
off
the
crudest
accommodations
on
emigrants
they
care
did
a
final
job
on
president
the
last
job
that
genius
of
hypnotics
would
ever
do
on
any
moron
important
or
otherwise
by
his
presidency
over
an
emptying
nation
joined
his
constituents
the
aboard
which
traveled
the
national
government
of
america
was
the
most
elaborate
of
all
the
spaceships
bigger
more
comfortable
with
a
lounge
that
was
handsome
though
cramped
and
cloakrooms
for
senators
and
representatives
it
went
however
to
the
same
place
as
the
others
and
killed
himself
leaving
a
note
that
stated
he
could
live
with
my
conscience
the
day
after
the
american
president
departed
barlow
flew
into
a
rage
across
his
specially
built
desk
were
supposed
to
flow
all
poprob
documents
and
this
thing
this
outrageous
thing
called
apparently
had
got
into
the
executive
stage
before
he
had
even
had
a
glimpse
of
it
he
buzzed
for
his
statistician
seemed
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
poprobterm
seemed
to
be
about
first
and
second
and
third
derivatives
whatever
they
were
barlow
had
a
deep
distrust
of
anything
more
complex
than
what
he
called
an
average
while
was
still
at
the
door
barlow
snapped
what
the
meaning
of
this
why
have
i
been
consulted
how
far
have
you
people
got
and
why
have
you
been
working
on
something
i
have
authorized
did
want
to
bother
you
chief
said
it
was
really
a
technical
matter
kind
of
a
final
cleanup
want
to
come
and
see
the
work
mollified
barlow
followed
his
statistician
down
the
corridor
you
still
should
have
gone
ahead
without
my
okay
he
grumbled
where
the
hell
would
you
people
have
been
without
me
that
right
chief
we
could
have
swung
it
ourselves
our
minds
just
do
work
that
way
and
all
that
stuff
you
knew
from
hitler
it
would
have
occurred
to
us
like
poor
they
were
in
a
machine
shop
at
the
end
of
a
slight
upward
incline
it
was
cold
pushed
a
button
that
started
a
motor
and
a
flood
of
arctic
light
poured
in
as
the
roof
parted
slowly
it
showed
a
small
spaceship
with
the
door
open
barlow
gaped
as
took
him
by
the
elbow
and
his
other
boys
appeared
the
engineer
his
propellants
man
advertising
in
you
go
chief
said
this
is
poprobterm
but
i
the
world
dictator
you
bet
chief
you
be
in
history
all
right
but
this
is
necessary
i
afraid
the
door
was
closed
acceleration
slammed
barlow
cruelly
to
the
metal
floor
something
broke
and
warm
wet
stuff
ran
from
his
mouth
to
his
chin
arctic
sunlight
through
a
port
suddenly
became
a
fierce
lancet
stabbing
at
his
eyes
he
was
out
of
the
atmosphere
lying
twisted
and
broken
under
the
acceleration
barlow
realized
that
some
things
had
not
changed
that
jack
ketch
was
never
asked
to
dinner
however
many
shillings
you
paid
him
to
do
your
dirty
work
that
murder
will
out
that
crime
pays
only
temporarily
the
last
thing
he
learned
was
that
death
is
the
end
of
pain
