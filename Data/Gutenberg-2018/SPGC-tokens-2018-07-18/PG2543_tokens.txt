polyeucte

pierre
corneille
translated
by
thomas
constable
introductory
note
pierre
corneille
was
born
in
rouen
in
the
son
of
an
official
was
educated
by
the
jesuits
and
practised
unsuccessfully
as
a
lawyer
his
dramatic
career
began
with
the
comedy
of
melite
but
it
was
by
his
medee
that
he
first
proved
his
tragic
genius
the
cid
appeared
in
and
a
series
of
masterpieces
followed
horace
cinna
polyeucte
le
menteur
after
a
failure
in
pertharite
he
retired
from
the
stage
deeply
hurt
by
the
disapproval
of
his
audience
six
years
later
he
resumed
play
writing
with
oedipe
and
continued
till
producing
in
all
some
thirty
plays
though
he
earned
a
great
reputation
he
was
poorly
paid
and
a
proud
and
sensitive
nature
laid
him
open
to
considerable
suffering
he
died
in
the
works
of
corneille
represent
most
fully
the
ideal
of
french
classical
tragedy
the
laws
to
which
this
type
of
tragedy
sought
to
conform
were
not
so
much
truth
to
nature
as
the
principles
which
the
critics
had
derived
from
a
somewhat
inadequate
interpretation
of
aristotle
and
of
the
practise
of
the
greek
tragedians
these
principles
concentrated
the
interest
of
the
play
upon
a
single
central
situation
in
order
to
emphasize
which
subordinate
characters
and
complicating
were
avoided
as
much
as
possible
there
was
little
or
no
action
upon
the
stage
and
the
events
of
the
plot
were
narrated
by
messengers
or
by
the
main
characters
in
conversation
with
confidantes
further
the
dramatic
unities
of
time
and
place
as
well
as
of
action
were
held
to
be
binding
one
result
of
these
rules
was
to
give
an
extraordinary
importance
to
the
speeches
and
it
is
in
the
eloquence
of
these
in
the
grandeur
and
dignity
of
the
versification
and
in
the
lofty
moral
elevation
of
the
characters
that
corneille
excels
all
of
these
qualities
are
admirably
exemplified
in
polyeucte
and
in
the
conduct
of
the
leading
personages
one
may
perceive
the
most
persistent
trait
of
this
dramatist
treatment
of
heroic
character
the
conquest
of
the
passions
by
the
reason
and
the
will
among
the
masterpieces
of
corneille
says
paul
de
is
assuredly
the
greatest
and
nothing
in
all
his
dramas
equals
the
extraordinary
beauty
of
the
character
of
polyeucte
characters

thousand
times
in

bow
to
a
peril
forged
by
vain
alarms
poly
i
know
that
dreams
are
born
to
fade
away
and
melt
in
air
before
the
light
of
day
i
know
that
misty
vapours
of
the
night
dissolve
and
fly
before
the
morning
bright
the
dream
is
naught
but
the
dear
dreamer
all
she
has
my
soul
nearchus
fast
in
thrall
who
holds
the
marriage
torch
august
divine
bids
me
to
her
sweet
voice
my
will
resign
she
fears
my
death
tho
baseless
this
her
fright
pauline
is
wrung
with
fear
by
day
by
night
my
road
to
duty
hampered
by
her
fears
how
can
i
go
when
all
undried
her
tears
her
terror
i
disown
and
all
alarms
yet
pity
holds
me
in
her
loving
arms
no
bolts
or
bars
imprison
yet
her
sighs
my
fetters
are
my
conquerors
her
eyes
say
kind
nearchus
is
the
cause
you
press
such
as
to
make
me
deaf
to
her
distress
the
bonds
i
slacken
i
would
not
unloose
nothing
i
yield
yet
grant
a
timely
truce
near
how
grant
you
know
not
what
are
you
assured
of
constancy
as
one
who
has
endured
god
claims
your
soul
for
him
now
now
the
fruit
yields
oh
who
shall
say
our
god
is
just
but
do
his
grace
and
power
descend
on
recreants
with
equal
shower
on
darkened
souls
his
flame
of
light
he
turns
yet
flame
neglected
soon
but
faintly
burns
and
dying
embers
fade
to
ashes
cold
if
we
the
heart
his
spirit
wooes
withhold
great
heaven
retains
the
fire
no
longer
sought
while
ashes
turn
to
dust
and
dust
to
naught
his
holy
baptism
he
bids
thee
seek
neglect
the
call
and
the
desire
grows
weak
ah
whilst
from
woman
breast
thou
heedst
the
sighs
the
flame
first
flickers
then
untended
dies
poly
you
know
me
ill
is
mine
that
holy
fire
fed
not
extinguished
by
unslaked
desire
her
tears
i
view
them
with
a
lover
eye
and
yet
your
christ
is
mine
a
christian
i
the
healing
cleansing
flood
me
shall
flow
i
would
efface
the
stain
from
birth
i
owe
i
would
be
pure
my
sealed
eyes
would
see
the
birthright
adam
lost
restored
to
me
this
this
the
unfading
crown
for
this
i
yearn
for
that
exhaustless
fount
i
thirst
i
burn
then
since
my
heart
is
true
nearchus
say
shall
i
not
grant
to
pity
this
delay
near
so
doth
the
ghostly
foe
our
souls
abuse
and
all
beyond
his
force
he
gains
by
ruse
he
hates
the
purpose
fast
he
can
not
foil
then
he
retreats
retreats
but
to
recoil
in
endless
barricade
obstruction
piles
is
tears
impede
smiles
and
this
poor
dream
his
coinage
of
the
night
gives
place
to
other
lures
all
falsely
bright
all
tricks
he
knows
and
uses
threats
and
prayers
attacks
in
parley
as
the
parthian

unheeded
weakest
link
must
fail

unwon
he

and

o
break
his
bonds

feeble
woman

flame
descended
kindled
scorched
it
left
me
pure
with
courage
to
resign
with
strength
to
endure
he
touched
my
heart
but
never
stained
the
soul
that
gained
this
hardest
conquest
at
rome
where
i
was
born
a
soldier
eye
marked
this
poor
face
from
which
must
polyeucte
fly
severus
was
his
name
ah
memory
may
spare
love
linked
with
death
a
tear
a
sigh
strat
say
is
it
he
who
at
the
risk
of
life
saved
decius
from
his
foes
and
endless
strife
who
dying
dealt
to
persia
stroke
of
death
and
shouted
with
his
latest
breath
his
whitening
bones
amid
the
nameless
brave
lie
still
unfound
unknown
without
a
grave
unburied
lies
his
dust
amid
the
slain
while
decius
rears
an
empty
urn
in
vain
paul
alas
is
he
all
rome
attests
his
worth
hide
not
his
memory
kindly
mother
earth

but
his
memory
that
i
adore
the
past
is
past
and
i
can
say
no
more
all
gifts
save
one
had
he
yes
fortune
held
her
hand
and
i
as
fortune
slave
obeyed
my
sire
command
strat
ah
i
must
wish
that
love
the
day
had
won
paul
which
duty
lost
then
had
i
been
undone
though
duty
gave
yet
duty
healed
my
pain
yet
say
not
that
my
love
was
weak
or
vain
our
tears
fell
fast
yet
bore
our
distress
the
fatal
fruit
of
strife
and
bitterness
then
then
i
left
my
hero
hope
and
rome
and
far
from
him
i
found
another
home

in
his
despair
sought

oh
faithless
one
ere

impious
horde

paul
you
say
words
at
all
my
fears
he
smiles
but
i
must
dread
these
christians

their
wiles
i
dread
their
vengeance
wreaked
upon
my
lord
for
christian
blood
my
father
has
outpoured
strat
their
sect
is
impious
mad
absurd
and
vain
their
rites
repulsive
as
their
cult
profane
deride
their
altar
their
weak
frenzy
ban
yet
do
they
war
with
gods
and
not
with
man

of

is
ever
hate

naught

headlong

impaired
the

pleads
for
his

a
crime
without

which
all

sinks
into

thy
rigour
felix
yet
more
great
his
guilt
paul

true
my

make
thy
polyeucte
mad
fresh
christian
zeal

not
always
new
the

compels
a
saner
view
paul

if
thou
him
still
all
hope
forsake
in
one
day
can
he
two
conversions
make
not
this
the
christians
mould
they
never
change
his
heart

fixed
past
power
of
man

is
no
poison
quaffed
all
unawares
what
martyrs

well
lost
for

i
know
the

know
their
courage
high
they
love
the
cross
so
for
the
cross
they
die

see
two
stakes
of
wood
the
felon
shame
they
see
a
halo
round
one
matchless
name
to
powers
of
earth
and
hell
and
torture
blind
in
death
for
him
they
love
they
rapture

they
joy
in

high
their

notorious
if
he
who

his
fall
the
more
inglorious
and
if
i
give

base
indignity

laggards
are

my

an
idle
empty
dream
where
nothing
can
endure
where
all

only
seem
death
ends
their
every
joy
which
fickle
fortune
leaves
they
gain
a

how
pomp
deceives
they
gather
wealth

may
envy
their

they
clear
a

so
envy
turns
to
hate
such
vast
ambition
mine
as

never
knew
death
bounds
it
not
for

its

true
peace
that

pauline

mine
for

how
was

bought
our

an
heirloom
to
our

to
him

thou

understand
how
poor
this
earth
couldst
thou

grasp
how
great
this
second
birth

yet
why
speak
of
treasure
rare
concealed
from
one
to
whom
light
is

unrevealed
paul
o
cruel
i
can
strangle
pain
no
more
is
this
the
fruit
of
all
thy
heavenly
lore
they
say
thy
christ
his
enemies
did
bless
thou
addest
insult
to
my
deep
distress
how
is
my
soul
so
dark
which
was
so
fair
thou
me
compare
of
my
bereavement
have
i
said
no
word
i
stilled
my
grief
that
i
might
soothe
my
lord
they
say
that
love
has
wings
and
all
they
say
is
true
for
all
thy
love
has
flown
yet
can
i
undo
the
vows
i
made
the
troth
i
plighted
binds
me
still
thou
fain
wouldst
quit
thy
wife
and
thou
shalt
have
thy
will
oh
but
to
leave
my
side
with
rapture
ecstasy
no
jealous
christ
can
will
why
grudge
me
one
poor
sigh
this
joy
this
transport
fierce
endeavour
to
conceal
i
do
not
share
thy
creed
but
i
at
least
can
feel
why
gloat
heavenly
gain
crowns
palms
i
know
not
what
where
polyeucte
is
blest
but
where
pauline
is
not
soul
body
spirit
i
am
thy
true
wife
to
own
that
i
am
but
a
bar
to
happiness
unknown
poly
alas
paul
o
that
so
faint
so
tame
yet
if
repentant
from
thy
heart
it
came
waken
hope
still
brief
and
banish
fears
i
wait
the
birth
of
thy
reluctant
tears
poly
these
tears
i
shed
o
might
the
spirit
pour
through
them
the
light
the
light
that
i
adore
then
were
my
only
grief
all
swept
away
for
thou
wouldst
join
me
in
the
realms
of
day

heaven
itself
would
have
its
bitterness
should
i
look
down
to
witness
thy
distress
o
god

dust
on
which
thy
breath
hath
stamped
thine
image

prayer
poly
for

paul
yes
i
will
go
if
absence
bring
relief
enter
severus
fabian
and
guards
who
comes
to
invade
ah
not
to
cure
my
grief
severus
who
could
guess
that
thou
wouldst
show
revenge
unworthy
a
prostrate
foe
poly
unworthy
thee
the
thought
pauline
for
i
severus
called
and
he
hath
heard
my
cry
my
importunity
he
will
excuse
my
prayer
i
know
that
he
will
not
refuse
severus
this
the
treasure
that
was
mine
to
thy
most
tender
care
i
now
resign
to
thee
as
noblest
man
that
i
have
known
since
earthly
ties
and
joys
i
must
disown
the
gift
is
worthy
thee
i
know
thy
worth
is
great
but
she
no
equal
hath
on
earth
my
life
the
bar
my
death
the
link
shall
be
oh
grudge
me
not
my
dear
brief
ecstasy
oh
ease
the
heart
that
once
was
hers
and
guide
her
doubting
footsteps
to
the
crucified
this
my
last
benison
all
else
is
poor
await
the
promised
light
believe
endure
but
words
are
vain
polyeucte
signs
to
guards
to
conduct
him
back
to
prison
exeunt
polyeucte
and
guards
sev
most
vain
no
word
have
i
such
blindness
must
amaze
must
stupefy
nay
this
is
frenzy
i
can
not
conceive
a
mind
so
strange
mine
ears
can
not
believe
that
one
who
loved
thee
yet
who
would
not
love
a
face
that
must
the
great
immortals
move
blessed
by
thy
heart
thy
sweetest
lips
to
taste
then
leave
refuse
spurn
yield
with
clamorous
haste
to
yield
a
girl
so
dear
so
pure
so
fair
and
of
that
gift
to
make
thy
rival
heir
this
beggars
madness
or
the
christian
bliss
beyond
man
soul
to
grasp
to
spurn
thy
kiss
we
treasure
barter
for
a
just
exchange
but
to
buy
pain
for
thee
pauline
is
strange
not
thus
ye
gods
severus
had
been
blind
to
perfect
bliss
had
fortune
been
more
kind
the
only
heaven
for
me
is
in
thine
eyes
these
are
my
kings
these
my
divinities
to
me
for
thee
were
death
with
torture
dear
but
to
renounce
thee
paul
nay
i
must
not
hear
thy
words
bring
back
the
dear
the
bygone
days
when
i
a
maid
might
listen
to
thy
praise
severus
thou
must
know
my
inmost
heart
i
hear
the
knell
bids
polyeucte
depart
he
dies
the
victim
of
thine
emperor
laws
and
thou
though
innocent
art
yet
the
cause
oh
if
thy
soul
to
thy
desires
a
slave
see
hope
emerging
from
my
husband
grave
then
will
i
wed
with
pain
despair
embrace
but
wed
severus
never
disgrace
to
light
fresh
torch
from
that
pale
flickering
fire
oh
bliss
too
monstrous
thrice
abhorred
desire
back
hope
back
happiness
the
mate
for
me
when
polyeucte
leaves
my
side
is
constancy
were
this
my
will
were
this
ye
gods
my
fate
to
shame
would
memory
turn
as
love
must
yield
to
hate
but
generous
art
thou
most
generous
be
his
pardon
will
my
father
grant
to
thee
he
fears
thee
more
if
polyeucte
life
he
take
for
thee
he
slays
him
yes
is
for
thy
sake
christ
died
for
man
let
pagan
virtue
dim
his
fame
plead
for
thy
foe
so
rival
him
no
easy
boon
i
ask
there
needs
a
soul
most
rare
but
when
the
fight
is
fierce
then
is
the
victory
fair
to
help
a
man
to
be
what
thou
wouldst
be
is
triumph
that
belongs
alone
to
thee
let
this
suffice
thee
she
whom
thou
hast
loved
she
who
by
thy
great
love
was
not
unmoved
of
thee
and
of
no
other
dares
to
crave
that
thou
severus
shouldst
my
husband
save
farewell
of
this
thy
labour
gauge
the
scope
if
thou
art
less
than
i
yet
dare
to
hope
then
tell
me
not
all
else
pauline
can
bear
exit
pauline
sev
where
am
i
fabian
has
the
crack
of
doom
turned
heaven
to
hell
made
life
a
living
tomb
nearer
and
dearer
ever
but
to
go
the
prize
within
my
grasp
must
i
this
fortune
brimming
cup
with
poison
filled
she
bids
me
drain
so
hope
is
killed
before
i
proffer
aught
i
am
refused
thus
sad
amazed
ashamed
in
doubt
abused
i
see
the
ghost
i
laid
to
life
revive
the
more
seductive
still
the
more
i
strive
ah
must
a
woman
sunk
in
deep
despair
teach
me
that
shame
is
base
and
honour
fair
and
while
i
madly
shriek
love
be
kind
pauline
keeps
an
equal
mind
o
generous
but
stern
must
these
dear
eyes
because
i
love
them
love
tyrannise
is
not
enough
to
lose
thee
i
must
give
my
aid
to
make
my
faithless
rival

is
not
enough
his
death
i
would
not

but
i

i
would
ban
fabian
ah
let
the
whole
crew
light
one
funeral
pyre
yes
let
the
daughter
perish
with
her
sire
this
curs
armenian
is
one
hornet

crush
all
then
sail
for

loves
thee

such
a

fabian
speak
low
for
jove

the
dangers
of
this
course
arouse
my
fears
what
decius
implore
a
nazarene
to

is
death
that
hath
thy
heart
thou
a

his
rage
against
the
sect
thou
knowest
well
his
power
unbridled
his

a

too
great
for

thou
rushest
on
thy

yes
such
advice
i
know
is
much
approved

not
thus

yet
one
more
word
this
to
thy
private
ear
the
fables
that
thou
dost
of
christians
hear
are
fables
only
coined
i
know
not
why
distorted
are
they
seen
in
decius
eye
they
practice
the
black
art
so
all
men
say
i
sought
to
learn
the
laws
that
they
obey
and
to
discover
what
the
secret
guilt
the
which
to
expiate
their
blood
is
spilt
yet
priests
of
cybele
dark
rites
pursue
at

untrammelled
this
is
nothing
new
to

all
the

now
strike
me
dead

tarrying

so
many
masters
must
provoke
revolt
and
ah
where
christians
live
there
life
is
pure

all
endure
we
give
these
