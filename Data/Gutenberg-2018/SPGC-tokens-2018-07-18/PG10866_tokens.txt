preface
to
the
french
translation
by
the
abbe
de
cazales
the
writer
of
this
preface
was
travelling
in
germany
when
he
chanced
to
meet
with
a
book
entitled
the
history
of
the
passion
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
from
the
meditations
of
anne
catherine
emmerich
which
appeared
to
him
both
interesting
and
edifying
its
style
was
unpretending
its
ideas
simple
its
tone
unassuming
its
sentiments
unexaggerated
and
its
every
sentence
expressive
of
the
most
complete
and
entire
submission
to
the
church
yet
at
the
same
time
it
would
have
been
difficult
anywhere
to
meet
with
a
more
touching
and
lifelike
paraphrase
of
the
gospel
narrative
he
thought
that
a
book
possessing
such
qualities
deserved
to
be
known
on
this
side
the
rhine
and
that
there
could
be
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
valued
for
its
own
sake
independent
of
the
somewhat
singular
source
whence
it
emanated
still
the
translator
has
by
no
means
disguised
to
himself
that
this
work
is
written
in
the
first
place
for
christians
that
is
to
say
for
men
who
have
the
right
to
be
very
diffident
in
giving
credence
to
particulars
concerning
facts
which
are
articles
of
faith
and
although
he
is
aware
that
bonaventure
and
many
others
in
their
paraphrases
of
the
gospel
history
have
mixed
up
traditional
details
with
those
given
in
the
sacred
text
even
these
examples
have
not
wholly
reassured
him
bonaventure
professed
only
to
give
a
paraphrase
whereas
these
revelations
appear
to
be
something
more
it
is
certain
that
the
holy
maiden
herself
gave
them
no
higher
title
than
that
of
dreams
and
that
the
transcriber
of
her
narratives
treats
as
blasphemous
the
idea
of
regarding
them
in
any
degree
as
equivalent
to
a
fifth
gospel
still
it
is
evident
that
the
confessors
who
exhorted
sister
emmerich
to
relate
what
she
saw
the
celebrated
poet
who
passed
four
years
near
her
couch
eagerly
transcribing
all
he
heard
her
say
and
the
german
bishops
who
encouraged
the
publication
of
his
book
considered
it
as
something
more
than
a
paraphrase
some
explanations
are
needful
on
this
head
the
writings
of
many
saints
introduce
us
into
a
new
and
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
a
miraculous
world
in
all
ages
there
have
been
revelations
about
the
past
the
present
the
future
and
even
concerning
things
absolutely
inaccessible
to
the
human
intellect
in
the
present
day
men
are
inclined
to
regard
these
revelations
as
simple
hallucinations
or
as
caused
by
a
sickly
condition
of
body
the
church
according
to
the
testimony
of
her
most
approved
writers
recognises
three
descriptions
of
ecstasy
of
which
the
first
is
simply
natural
and
entirely
brought
about
by
certain
physical
tendencies
and
a
highly
imaginative
mind
the
second
divine
or
angelic
arising
from
intercourse
held
with
the
supernatural
world
and
the
third
produced
by
infernal
agency
see
on
this
head
the
work
of
cardinal
bona
de
discretione
spirituum
lest
we
should
here
write
a
book
instead
of
a
preface
we
will
not
enter
into
any
development
of
this
doctrine
which
appears
to
us
highly
philosophical
and
without
which
no
satisfactory
explanation
can
be
given
on
the
subject
of
the
soul
of
man
and
its
various
states
the
church
directs
certain
means
to
be
employed
to
ascertain
by
what
spirit
these
ecstasies
are
produced
according
to
the
maxim
of
john
the
spirits
if
they
be
of
god
jn
when
circumstances
or
events
claiming
to
be
supernatural
have
been
properly
examined
according
to
certain
rules
the
church
has
in
all
ages
made
a
selection
from
them
many
persons
who
have
been
habitually
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
have
been
canonised
and
their
books
approved
but
this
approbation
has
seldom
amounted
to
more
than
a
declaration
that
these
books
contained
nothing
contrary
to
faith
and
that
they
were
likely
to
promote
a
spirit
of
piety
among
the
faithful
for
the
church
is
only
founded
on
the
word
of
christ
and
on
the
revelations
made
to
the
apostles
whatever
may
since
have
been
revealed
to
certain
saints
possesses
purely
a
relative
value
the
reality
of
which
may
even
be
disputed
it
being
one
of
the
admirable
characteristics
of
the
church
that
though
inflexibly
one
in
dogma
she
allows
entire
liberty
to
the
human
mind
in
all
besides
thus
we
may
believe
private
revelations
above
all
when
those
persons
to
whom
they
were
made
have
been
raised
by
the
church
to
the
rank
of
saints
publicly
honoured
invoked
and
venerated
but
even
in
these
cases
we
may
without
ceasing
to
be
perfectly
orthodox
dispute
their
authenticity
and
divine
origin
it
is
the
place
of
reason
to
dispute
and
to
select
as
it
sees
best
with
regard
to
the
rule
for
discerning
between
the
good
and
the
evil
spirit
it
is
no
other
according
to
all
theologians
than
that
of
the
gospel
a
fructibus
eorum
cognoscetis
eos
by
their
fruits
you
shall
know
them
it
must
be
examined
in
the
first
place
whether
the
person
who
professes
to
have
revelations
mistrusts
what
passes
within
himself
whether
he
would
prefer
a
more
common
path
whether
far
from
boasting
of
the
extraordinary
graces
which
he
receives
he
seeks
to
hide
them
and
only
makes
them
known
through
obedience
and
finally
whether
he
is
continually
advancing
in
humility
mortification
and
charity
next
the
revelations
themselves
must
be
very
closely
examined
into
it
must
be
seen
whether
there
is
anything
in
them
contrary
to
faith
whether
they
are
conformable
to
scripture
and
apostolic
tradition
and
whether
they
are
related
in
a
headstrong
spirit
or
in
a
spirit
of
entire
submission
to
the
church
whoever
reads
the
life
of
anne
catherine
emmerich
and
her
book
will
be
satisfied
that
no
fault
can
be
found
in
any
of
these
respects
either
with
herself
or
with
her
revelations
her
book
resembles
in
many
points
the
writings
of
a
great
number
of
saints
and
her
life
also
bears
the
most
striking
similitude
to
theirs
to
be
convinced
of
this
fact
we
need
but
study
the
writings
or
what
is
related
of
saints
francis
of
assisi
bernard
bridget
hildegard
catherine
of
genoa
catherine
of
sienna
ignatius
john
of
the
cross
teresa
and
an
immense
number
of
other
holy
persons
who
are
less
known
so
much
being
conceded
it
is
clear
that
in
considering
sister
emmerich
to
have
been
inspired
by
god
holy
spirit
we
are
not
ascribing
more
merit
to
her
book
than
is
allowed
by
the
church
to
all
those
of
the
same
class
they
are
all
edifying
and
may
serve
to
promote
piety
which
is
their
sole
object
we
must
not
exaggerate
their
importance
by
holding
as
an
absolute
fact
that
they
proceed
from
divine
inspiration
a
favour
so
great
that
its
existence
in
any
particular
case
should
not
be
credited
save
with
the
utmost
circumspection
with
regard
however
to
our
present
publication
it
may
be
urged
that
considering
the
superior
talents
of
the
transcriber
of
sister
emmerich
narrations
the
language
and
expressions
which
he
has
made
use
of
may
not
always
have
been
identical
with
those
which
she
employed
we
have
no
hesitation
whatever
in
allowing
the
force
of
this
argument
most
fully
do
we
believe
in
the
entire
sincerity
of
clement
brentano
because
we
both
know
and
love
him
and
besides
his
exemplary
piety
and
the
retired
life
which
he
leads
secluded
from
a
world
in
which
it
would
depend
but
on
himself
to
hold
the
highest
place
are
guarantees
amply
sufficient
to
satisfy
any
impartial
mind
of
his
sincerity
a
poem
such
as
he
might
publish
if
he
only
pleased
would
cause
him
to
be
ranked
at
once
among
the
most
eminent
of
the
german
poets
whereas
the
office
which
he
has
taken
upon
himself
of
secretary
to
a
poor
visionary
has
brought
him
nothing
but
contemptuous
raillery
nevertheless
we
have
no
intention
to
assert
that
in
giving
the
conversations
and
discourses
of
sister
emmerich
that
order
and
coherency
in
which
they
were
greatly
wanting
and
writing
them
down
in
his
own
way
he
may
not
unwittingly
have
arranged
explained
and
embellished
them
but
this
would
not
have
the
effect
of
destroying
the
originality
of
the
recital
or
impugning
either
the
sincerity
of
the
nun
or
that
of
the
writer
the
translator
professes
to
be
unable
to
understand
how
any
man
can
write
for
mere
writing
sake
and
without
considering
the
probable
effects
which
his
work
will
produce
this
book
such
as
it
is
appears
to
him
to
be
at
once
unusually
edifying
and
highly
poetical
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
it
has
properly
speaking
no
literary
pretensions
whatever
neither
the
uneducated
maiden
whose
visions
are
here
relate
nor
the
excellent
christian
writer
who
had
published
them
in
so
entire
a
spirit
of
literary
disinterestedness
ever
had
the
remotest
idea
of
such
a
thing
and
yet
there
are
not
in
our
opinion
many
highly
compositions
calculated
to
produce
an
effect
in
any
degree
comparable
to
that
which
will
be
brought
about
by
the
perusal
of
this
unpretending
little
work
it
is
our
hope
that
it
will
make
a
strong
impression
even
upon
worldlings
and
that
in
many
hearts
it
will
prepare
the
way
for
better
ideas
perhaps
even
for
a
lasting
change
of
life
in
the
next
place
we
are
not
sorry
to
call
public
attention
in
some
degree
to
all
that
class
of
phenomena
which
preceded
the
foundation
of
the
church
which
has
since
been
perpetuated
uninterruptedly
and
which
too
many
christians
are
disposed
to
reject
altogether
either
through
ignorance
and
want
of
reflection
or
purely
through
human
respect
this
is
a
field
which
has
hitherto
been
but
little
explored
historically
psychologically
and
physiologically
and
it
would
be
well
if
reflecting
minds
were
to
bestow
upon
it
a
careful
and
attentive
investigation
to
our
christian
readers
we
must
remark
that
this
work
has
received
the
approval
of
ecclesiastical
authorities
it
has
been
prepared
for
the
press
under
the
superintendence
of
the
two
late
bishops
of
ratisbonne
sailer
and
wittman
these
names
are
but
little
known
in
france
but
in
germany
they
are
identical
with
learning
piety
ardent
charity
and
a
life
wholly
devoted
to
the
maintenance
and
propagation
of
the
catholic
faith
many
french
priests
have
given
their
opinion
that
the
translation
of
a
book
of
this
character
could
not
but
tend
to
nourish
piety
without
however
countenancing
that
weakness
of
spirit
which
is
disposed
to
lend
more
importance
in
some
respects
to
private
than
to
general
revelations
and
consequently
to
substitute
matters
which
we
are
simply
permitted
to
believe
in
the
place
of
those
which
are
of
faith
we
feel
convinced
that
no
one
will
take
offence
at
certain
details
given
on
the
subject
of
the
outrages
which
were
suffered
by
our
divine
lord
during
the
course
of
his
passion
our
readers
will
remember
the
words
of
the
psalmist
am
a
worm
and
no
man
the
reproach
of
men
and
the
outcast
of
the
people
ps
and
those
of
the
apostle
in
all
things
like
as
we
are
without
sin
heb
did
we
stand
in
need
of
a
precedent
we
should
request
our
readers
to
remember
how
plainly
and
crudely
bossuet
describes
the
same
scenes
in
the
most
eloquent
of
his
four
sermons
on
the
passion
of
our
lord
on
the
other
hand
there
have
been
so
many
grand
platonic
or
rhetorical
sentences
in
the
books
published
of
late
years
concerning
that
abstract
entity
on
which
the
writers
have
been
pleased
to
bestow
the
christian
title
of
the
word
or
logos
that
it
may
be
eminently
useful
to
show
the
the
word
made
flesh
in
all
the
reality
of
his
life
on
earth
of
his
humiliation
and
of
his
sufferings
it
must
be
evident
that
the
cause
of
truth
and
still
more
that
of
edification
will
not
be
the
losers
introduction
the
following
meditations
will
probably
rank
high
among
many
similar
works
which
the
contemplative
love
of
jesus
has
produced
but
it
is
our
duty
here
plainly
to
affirm
that
they
have
no
pretensions
whatever
to
be
regarded
as
they
are
but
intended
to
take
one
of
the
lowest
places
among
those
numerous
representations
of
the
passion
which
have
been
given
us
by
pious
writers
and
artists
and
to
be
considered
at
the
very
utmost
as
the
lenten
meditations
of
a
devout
nun
related
in
all
simplicity
and
written
down
in
the
plainest
and
most
literal
language
from
her
own
dictation
to
these
meditations
she
herself
never
attached
more
than
a
mere
human
value
and
never
related
them
except
through
obedience
and
upon
the
repeated
commands
of
the
directors
of
her
conscience
the
writer
of
the
following
pages
was
introduced
to
this
holy
religious
by
count
leopold
de
stolberg
the
count
de
stolberg
is
one
of
the
most
eminent
converts
whom
the
catholic
church
has
made
from
protestantism
he
died
in
dean
bernard
overberg
her
director
extraordinary
and
bishop
michael
sailer
who
had
often
been
her
counsellor
and
consoler
urged
her
to
relate
to
us
in
detail
all
that
she
experienced
and
the
latter
who
survived
her
took
the
deepest
interest
in
the
arrangement
and
publication
of
the
notes
taken
down
from
her
dictation
the
bishop
of
ratisbonne
one
of
the
most
celebrated
defenders
of
the
faith
in
germany
these
illustrious
and
holy
men
now
dead
and
whose
memory
is
blessed
were
in
continual
communion
of
prayer
with
anne
catherine
whom
they
loved
and
respected
on
account
of
the
singular
graces
with
which
god
had
favoured
her
the
editor
of
this
book
received
equal
encouragement
and
met
with
no
less
sympathy
in
his
labours
from
the
late
bishop
of
ratisbonne
mgr
wittman
mgr
wittman
was
the
worthy
successor
of
sailer
and
a
man
of
eminent
sanctity
whose
memory
is
held
in
veneration
by
all
the
catholics
of
the
south
of
germany
this
holy
bishop
who
was
so
deeply
versed
in
the
ways
of
divine
grace
and
so
well
acquainted
with
its
effects
on
certain
souls
both
from
his
private
investigations
of
the
subject
and
his
own
experience
took
the
most
lively
interest
in
all
that
concerned
anne
catherine
and
on
hearing
of
the
work
in
which
the
editor
of
this
book
was
engaged
he
strongly
exhorted
him
to
publish
it
things
have
not
been
communicated
to
you
for
nothing
would
he
often
say
had
his
views
in
all
publish
something
at
least
of
what
you
know
for
you
will
thereby
benefit
many
souls
he
at
the
same
time
brought
forward
various
instances
from
his
own
experience
and
that
of
others
showing
the
benefit
which
had
been
derived
from
the
study
of
works
of
a
similar
character
he
delighted
in
calling
such
privileged
souls
as
anne
catherine
the
marrow
of
the
bones
of
the
church
according
to
the
expression
of
john
chrysostom
medulla
enim
hujus
mundi
sunt
and
he
encouraged
the
publication
of
their
lives
and
writings
as
far
as
lay
in
his
power
the
editor
of
this
book
being
taken
by
a
kind
friend
to
the
dying
bed
of
the
holy
bishop
had
no
reason
whatever
to
expect
to
be
recognised
as
he
had
only
once
in
his
life
conversed
with
him
for
a
few
minutes
nevertheless
the
dying
saint
knew
him
again
and
after
a
few
most
kind
words
blessed
and
exhorted
him
to
continue
his
work
for
the
glory
of
god
encouraged
by
the
approbation
of
such
men
we
therefore
yield
to
the
wishes
of
many
virtuous
friends
in
publishing
the
meditations
on
the
passion
of
this
humble
religious
to
whom
god
granted
the
favour
of
being
at
times
simple
ingenuous
and
ignorant
as
a
child
while
at
others
she
was
clear
sighted
sensible
possessed
of
a
deep
insight
into
the
most
mysterious
and
hidden
things
and
consumed
with
burning
and
heroic
zeal
but
ever
forgetful
of
self
deriving
her
whole
strength
from
jesus
alone
and
steadfast
in
the
most
perfect
humility
and
entire
we
give
our
readers
a
slight
sketch
of
her
life
intending
at
some
future
day
to
publish
her
biography
more
in
full
the
life
of
anne
catherine
emmerich
religious
of
the
order
of
augustine
at
the
convent
of
agnetenberg
dulmen
westphalia
venerable
anne
catherine
was
born
at
flamske
a
village
situated
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
coesfeld
in
the
bishopric
of
munster
on
the
of
september
and
was
baptised
in
the
church
of
james
at
coesfeld
her
parents
bernard
emmerich
and
anne
hiller
were
poor
peasants
but
distinguished
for
their
piety
and
virtue
the
childhood
of
anne
catherine
bore
a
striking
resemblance
to
that
of
the
venerable
anne
garzias
de
barthelemi
of
dominica
del
paradiso
and
of
several
other
holy
persons
born
in
the
same
rank
of
life
as
herself
her
used
to
appear
to
her
as
a
child
and
when
she
was
taking
care
of
sheep
in
the
fields
the
good
shepherd
himself
under
the
form
of
a
young
shepherd
would
frequently
come
to
her
assistance
from
childhood
she
was
accustomed
to
have
divine
knowledge
imparted
to
her
in
visions
of
all
kinds
and
was
often
favoured
by
visits
from
the
mother
of
god
and
queen
of
heaven
who
under
the
form
of
a
sweet
lovely
and
majestic
lady
would
bring
the
divine
child
to
be
as
it
were
her
companion
and
would
assure
her
that
she
loved
and
would
ever
protect
her
many
of
the
saints
would
also
appear
to
her
and
receive
from
her
hands
the
garlands
of
flowers
which
she
had
prepared
in
honour
of
their
festivals
all
these
favours
and
visions
surprised
the
child
less
than
if
an
earthly
princess
and
the
lords
and
ladies
of
her
court
had
come
to
visit
her
nor
was
she
later
in
life
more
surprised
at
these
celestial
visits
for
her
innocence
caused
her
to
feel
far
more
at
her
ease
with
our
divine
lord
his
blessed
mother
and
the
saints
than
she
could
ever
be
with
even
the
most
kind
and
amiable
of
her
earthly
companions
the
names
of
father
mother
brother
and
spouse
appeared
to
her
expressive
of
the
real
connections
subsisting
between
god
and
man
since
the
eternal
word
had
been
pleased
to
be
born
of
a
woman
and
so
to
become
our
brother
and
these
sacred
titles
were
not
mere
words
in
her
mouth
while
yet
a
child
she
used
to
speak
with
innocent
candour
and
simplicity
of
all
that
she
saw
and
her
listeners
would
be
filled
with
admiration
at
the
histories
she
would
relate
from
holy
writ
but
their
questions
and
remarks
having
sometimes
disturbed
her
peace
of
mind
she
determined
to
keep
silence
on
such
subjects
for
the
future
in
her
innocence
of
heart
she
thought
that
it
was
not
right
to
talk
of
things
of
this
sort
that
other
persons
never
did
so
and
that
her
speech
should
be
only
yea
yea
and
nay
nay
or
praise
be
to
jesus
christ
the
visions
with
which
she
was
favoured
were
so
like
realities
and
appeared
to
her
so
sweet
and
delightful
that
she
supposed
all
christian
children
were
favoured
with
the
same
and
she
concluded
that
those
who
never
talked
on
such
subjects
were
only
more
discreet
and
modest
than
herself
so
she
resolved
to
keep
silence
also
to
be
like
them
almost
from
her
cradle
she
possessed
the
gift
of
distinguishing
what
was
good
or
evil
holy
or
profane
blessed
or
accursed
in
material
as
well
as
in
spiritual
things
thus
resembling
sibyllina
of
pavia
ida
of
louvain
ursula
benincasa
and
some
other
holy
souls
in
her
earliest
childhood
she
used
to
bring
out
of
the
fields
useful
herbs
which
no
one
had
ever
before
discovered
to
be
good
for
anything
and
plant
them
near
her
father
cottage
or
in
some
spot
where
she
was
accustomed
to
work
and
play
while
on
the
other
hand
she
would
root
up
all
poisonous
plants
and
particularly
those
ever
used
for
superstitious
practices
or
in
dealings
with
the
devil
were
she
by
chance
in
a
place
where
some
great
crime
had
been
committed
she
would
hastily
run
away
or
begin
to
pray
and
do
penance
she
used
also
to
perceive
by
intuition
when
she
was
in
a
consecrated
spot
return
thanks
to
god
and
be
filled
with
a
sweet
feeling
of
peace
when
a
priest
passed
by
with
the
blessed
sacrament
even
at
a
great
distance
from
her
home
or
from
the
place
where
she
was
taking
care
of
her
flock
she
would
feel
a
strong
attraction
in
the
direction
whence
he
was
coming
run
to
meet
him
and
be
kneeling
in
the
road
adoring
the
blessed
sacrament
long
before
he
could
reach
the
spot
she
knew
when
any
object
was
consecrated
and
experienced
a
feeling
of
disgust
and
repugnance
when
in
the
neighbourhood
of
old
pagan
cemeteries
whereas
she
was
attracted
to
the
sacred
remains
of
the
saints
as
steel
by
the
magnet
when
relics
were
shown
to
her
she
knew
what
saints
they
had
belonged
to
and
could
give
not
only
accounts
of
the
minutest
and
hitherto
unknown
particulars
of
their
lives
but
also
histories
of
the
relics
themselves
and
of
the
places
where
they
had
been
preserved
during
her
whole
life
she
had
continual
intercourse
with
the
souls
in
purgatory
and
all
her
actions
and
prayers
were
offered
for
the
relief
of
their
sufferings
she
was
frequently
called
upon
to
assist
them
and
even
reminded
in
some
miraculous
manner
if
she
chanced
to
forget
them
often
while
yet
very
young
she
used
to
be
awakened
out
of
her
sleep
by
bands
of
suffering
souls
and
to
follow
them
on
cold
winter
nights
with
bare
feet
the
whole
length
of
the
way
of
the
cross
to
coesfeld
though
the
ground
was
covered
with
snow
from
her
infancy
to
the
day
of
her
death
she
was
indefatigable
in
relieving
the
sick
and
in
dressing
and
curing
wounds
and
ulcers
and
she
was
accustomed
to
give
to
the
poor
every
farthing
she
possessed
so
tender
was
her
conscience
that
the
slightest
sin
she
fell
into
caused
her
such
pain
as
to
make
her
ill
and
absolution
then
always
restored
her
immediately
to
health
the
extraordinary
nature
of
the
favours
bestowed
on
her
by
almighty
god
was
no
hindrance
in
the
way
of
her
devoting
herself
to
hard
labour
like
any
other
and
we
may
also
be
allowed
to
observe
that
a
certain
degree
of
the
spirit
of
prophecy
is
not
unusually
to
be
found
among
her
country
men
and
women
she
was
taught
in
the
school
of
suffering
and
mortification
and
there
learned
lessons
of
perfection
she
allowed
herself
no
more
sleep
or
food
than
was
absolutely
necessary
passed
whole
hours
in
prayer
every
night
and
in
winter
often
knelt
out
of
doors
on
the
snow
she
slept
on
the
ground
on
planks
arranged
in
the
form
of
a
cross
her
food
and
drink
consisted
of
what
was
rejected
by
others
she
always
kept
the
best
parts
even
of
that
for
the
poor
and
sick
and
when
she
did
not
know
of
anyone
to
give
them
to
she
offered
them
to
god
in
a
spirit
of
faith
begging
him
to
give
them
to
some
person
who
was
more
in
need
than
herself
when
there
was
anything
to
be
seen
or
heard
which
had
no
reference
to
god
or
religion
she
found
some
excuse
for
avoiding
the
spot
to
which
others
were
hastening
or
if
there
closed
her
eyes
and
ears
she
was
accustomed
to
say
that
useless
actions
were
sinful
and
that
when
we
denied
our
bodily
senses
any
gratification
of
this
kind
we
were
amply
repaid
by
the
progress
which
we
made
in
the
interior
life
in
the
same
manner
as
pruning
renders
vines
and
other
fruittrees
more
productive
from
her
early
youth
and
wherever
she
went
she
had
frequent
symbolical
visions
which
showed
her
in
parables
as
it
were
the
object
of
her
existence
the
means
of
attaining
it
and
her
future
sufferings
together
with
the
dangers
and
conflicts
which
she
would
have
to
go
through
she
was
in
her
sixteenth
year
when
one
day
whilst
at
work
in
the
fields
with
her
parents
and
sisters
she
heard
the
bell
ringing
at
the
convent
of
the
sisters
of
the
annunciation
at
coesfeld
this
sound
so
inflamed
her
secret
desire
to
become
a
nun
and
had
so
great
an
effect
upon
her
that
she
fainted
away
and
remained
ill
and
weak
for
a
long
time
after
when
in
her
eighteenth
year
she
was
apprenticed
at
coesfeld
to
a
dressmaker
with
whom
she
passed
two
years
and
then
returned
to
her
parents
she
asked
to
be
received
at
the
convents
of
the
augustinians
at
borken
of
the
trappists
at
darfeld
and
of
the
poor
clares
at
munster
but
her
poverty
and
that
of
these
convents
always
presented
an
insuperable
obstacle
to
her
being
received
at
the
age
of
twenty
having
saved
twenty
thalers
about
english
which
she
had
earned
by
her
sewing
she
went
with
this
little
sum
a
perfect
fortune
for
a
poor
to
a
pious
organist
of
coesfeld
whose
daughter
she
had
known
when
she
first
lived
in
the
town
her
hope
was
that
by
learning
to
play
on
the
organ
she
might
succeed
in
obtaining
admittance
into
a
convent
but
her
irresistible
desire
to
serve
the
poor
and
give
them
everything
she
possessed
left
her
no
time
to
learn
music
and
before
long
she
had
so
completely
stripped
herself
of
everything
that
her
good
mother
was
obliged
to
bring
her
bread
milk
and
eggs
for
her
own
wants
and
those
of
the
poor
with
whom
she
shared
everything
then
her
mother
said
desire
to
leave
your
father
and
myself
and
enter
a
convent
gives
us
much
pain
but
you
are
still
my
beloved
child
and
when
i
look
at
your
vacant
seat
at
home
and
reflect
that
you
have
given
away
all
your
savings
so
as
to
be
now
in
want
my
heart
is
filled
with
sorrow
and
i
have
now
brought
you
enough
to
keep
you
for
some
time
anne
catherine
replied
dear
mother
it
is
true
that
i
have
nothing
at
all
left
because
it
was
the
holy
will
of
god
that
others
should
be
assisted
by
me
and
since
i
have
given
all
to
him
he
will
now
take
care
of
me
and
bestow
his
divine
assistance
upon
us
all
she
remained
some
years
at
coesfeld
employed
in
labour
good
works
and
prayer
being
always
guided
by
the
same
inward
inspirations
she
was
docile
and
submissive
as
a
child
in
the
hands
of
her
although
in
this
brief
sketch
of
her
life
we
are
obliged
to
omit
many
interesting
circumstances
there
is
one
which
we
must
not
pass
over
in
silence
when
about
years
of
age
she
received
a
favour
from
our
lord
which
has
been
granted
to
many
persons
devoted
in
an
especial
manner
to
meditation
on
his
painful
passion
namely
to
experience
the
actual
and
visible
sufferings
of
his
sacred
head
when
crowned
with
thorns
the
following
is
the
account
she
herself
has
given
of
the
circumstances
under
which
so
mysterious
a
favour
was
bestowed
upon
her
four
years
previous
to
my
admittance
into
the
convent
consequently
in
it
happened
that
i
was
in
the
jesuits
church
at
coesfeld
at
about
twelve
in
the
day
kneeling
before
a
crucifix
and
absorbed
in
meditation
when
all
on
a
sudden
i
felt
a
strong
but
pleasant
heat
in
my
head
and
i
saw
my
divine
spouse
under
the
form
of
a
young
man
clothed
with
light
come
towards
me
from
the
altar
where
the
blessed
sacrament
was
preserved
in
the
tabernacle
in
his
left
hand
he
held
a
crown
of
flowers
in
his
right
hand
a
crown
of
thorns
and
he
bade
me
choose
which
i
would
have
i
chose
the
crown
of
thorns
he
placed
it
on
my
head
and
i
pressed
it
down
with
both
hands
then
he
disappeared
and
i
returned
to
myself
feeling
however
violent
pain
around
my
head
i
was
obliged
to
leave
the
church
which
was
going
to
be
closed
one
of
my
companions
was
kneeling
by
my
side
and
as
i
thought
she
might
have
seen
what
happened
to
me
i
asked
her
when
we
got
home
whether
there
was
not
a
wound
on
my
forehead
and
spoke
to
her
in
general
terms
of
my
vision
and
of
the
violent
pain
which
had
followed
it
she
could
see
nothing
outwardly
but
was
not
astonished
at
what
i
told
her
because
she
knew
that
i
was
sometimes
in
an
extraordinary
state
without
her
being
able
to
understand
the
cause
the
next
day
my
forehead
and
temples
were
very
much
swelled
and
i
suffered
terribly
this
pain
and
swelling
often
returned
and
sometimes
lasted
whole
days
and
nights
i
did
not
remark
that
there
was
blood
on
my
head
until
my
companions
told
me
i
had
better
put
on
a
clean
cap
because
mine
was
covered
with
red
spots
i
let
them
think
whatever
they
liked
about
it
only
taking
care
to
arrange
my
head
dress
so
as
to
hide
the
blood
which
flowed
from
my
head
and
i
continued
to
observe
the
same
precaution
even
after
i
entered
the
convent
where
only
one
person
perceived
the
blood
and
she
never
betrayed
my
secret
several
other
contemplative
persons
especially
devoted
to
the
passion
of
our
lord
have
been
admitted
to
the
privilege
of
suffering
the
torture
inflicted
by
the
crown
of
thorns
after
having
seen
a
vision
in
which
the
two
crowns
were
offered
them
to
choose
between
for
instance
among
others
catherine
of
sienna
and
pasithea
of
crogis
a
poor
clare
of
the
same
town
who
died
in
the
writer
of
these
pages
may
here
be
allowed
to
remark
that
he
himself
has
in
full
daylight
several
times
seen
blood
flow
down
the
forehead
and
face
and
even
beyond
the
linen
wrapped
round
the
neck
of
anne
catherine
her
desire
to
embrace
a
religious
life
was
at
length
gratified
the
parents
of
a
young
person
whom
the
augustinian
nuns
of
dulmen
wished
to
receive
into
their
order
declared
that
they
would
not
give
their
consent
except
on
condition
that
anne
catherine
was
taken
at
the
same
time
the
nuns
yielded
their
assent
though
somewhat
reluctantly
on
account
of
their
extreme
poverty
and
on
the
november
one
week
before
the
feast
of
the
presentation
of
the
blessed
virgin
anne
catherine
entered
on
her
novitiate
at
the
present
day
vocations
are
not
so
severely
tested
as
formerly
but
in
her
case
providence
imposed
special
trials
for
which
rigorous
as
they
were
she
felt
she
never
could
be
too
grateful
sufferings
or
privations
which
a
soul
either
alone
or
in
union
with
others
imposes
upon
herself
for
god
greater
glory
are
easy
to
bear
but
there
is
one
cross
more
nearly
resembling
the
cross
of
christ
than
any
other
and
that
is
lovingly
and
patiently
to
submit
to
unjust
punishment
rebuffs
or
accusations
it
was
the
will
of
god
that
during
her
novitiate
she
should
independently
of
the
will
of
any
creature
be
tried
as
severely
as
the
most
strict
mistress
of
novices
could
have
done
before
any
mitigations
had
been
allowed
in
the
rules
she
learned
to
regard
her
companions
as
instruments
in
the
hands
of
god
for
her
sanctification
and
at
a
later
period
of
her
life
many
other
things
appeared
to
her
in
the
same
light
but
as
it
was
necessary
that
her
fervent
soul
should
be
constantly
tried
in
the
school
of
the
cross
god
was
pleased
that
she
should
remain
in
it
all
her
life
in
many
ways
her
position
in
the
convent
was
excessively
painful
not
one
of
her
companions
nor
even
any
priest
or
doctor
could
understand
her
case
she
had
learned
when
living
among
poor
peasants
to
hide
the
wonderful
gifts
which
god
had
bestowed
on
her
but
the
case
was
altered
now
that
she
was
in
familiar
intercourse
with
a
large
number
of
nuns
who
though
certainly
good
and
pious
were
filled
with
feelings
of
curiosity
and
even
of
spiritual
jealousy
in
her
regard
then
the
contracted
ideas
of
the
community
and
the
complete
ignorance
of
the
nuns
concerning
all
those
exterior
phenomena
by
which
the
interior
life
manifests
itself
gave
her
much
to
endure
the
more
so
as
these
phenomena
displayed
themselves
in
the
most
unusual
and
astonishing
manner
she
heard
everything
that
was
said
against
her
even
when
the
speakers
were
at
on
end
of
the
convent
and
she
at
the
other
and
her
heart
was
most
deeply
wounded
as
if
by
poisoned
arrows
yet
she
bore
all
patiently
a
lovingly
without
showing
that
she
knew
what
was
said
of
her
more
than
once
charity
impelled
her
to
cast
herself
at
the
feet
of
some
nun
who
was
particularly
prejudiced
against
her
and
ask
her
pardon
with
tears
then
she
was
suspected
of
listening
at
the
doors
for
the
private
feelings
of
dislike
entertained
against
her
became
known
no
one
knew
how
and
the
nuns
felt
uncomfortable
and
uneasy
in
spite
of
themselves
when
in
her
company
whenever
the
rule
the
minutest
point
of
which
was
sacred
in
her
eyes
was
neglected
in
the
slightest
degree
she
beheld
in
spirit
each
infringement
and
at
times
was
inspired
to
fly
to
the
spot
where
the
rule
was
being
broken
by
some
infringement
of
the
vow
of
poverty
or
disregards
of
the
hours
of
silence
and
she
would
then
repeat
suitable
passages
from
the
rule
without
having
ever
learned
them
she
thus
became
an
object
of
aversion
to
all
those
religious
who
broke
the
rule
and
her
sudden
appearance
among
them
had
almost
the
effect
of
apparitions
god
had
bestowed
upon
her
the
gift
of
tears
to
so
great
an
extent
that
she
often
passed
whole
hours
in
the
church
weeping
over
the
sins
and
ingratitude
of
men
the
sufferings
of
the
church
the
imperfections
of
the
community
and
her
own
faults
but
these
tears
of
sublime
sorrow
could
be
understood
by
none
but
god
before
whom
she
shed
them
and
men
attributed
them
to
mere
caprice
a
spirit
of
discontent
or
some
other
similar
cause
her
confessor
had
enjoined
that
she
should
receive
the
holy
communion
more
frequently
than
the
other
nuns
because
so
ardently
did
she
hunger
after
the
bread
of
angels
that
she
had
been
more
than
once
near
dying
these
heavenly
sentiments
awakened
feelings
of
jealousy
in
her
sisters
who
sometimes
even
accused
her
of
hypocrisy
the
favour
which
had
been
shown
her
in
her
admittance
into
the
convent
in
spite
of
her
poverty
was
also
made
a
subject
of
reproach
the
thought
of
being
thus
an
occasion
of
sin
to
others
was
most
painful
to
her
and
she
continually
besought
god
to
permit
her
to
bear
herself
the
penalty
of
this
want
of
charity
in
her
regard
about
christmas
of
the
year
she
had
a
very
severe
illness
which
began
by
a
violent
pain
about
her
heart
this
pain
did
not
leave
her
even
when
she
was
cured
and
she
bore
it
in
silence
until
the
year
when
the
mark
of
a
cross
was
imprinted
exteriorly
in
the
same
place
as
we
shall
relate
further
on
her
weakness
and
delicate
health
caused
her
to
be
looked
upon
more
as
burdensome
than
useful
to
the
community
and
this
of
course
told
against
her
in
all
ways
yet
she
was
never
weary
of
working
and
serving
the
others
nor
was
she
ever
so
happy
as
at
this
period
of
her
life
spent
in
privations
and
sufferings
of
every
description
on
the
of
november
at
the
age
of
she
pronounced
her
solemn
vows
and
became
the
spouse
of
jesus
christ
in
the
convent
of
agnetenberg
at
dulmen
i
had
pronounced
my
vows
she
says
relations
were
again
extremely
kind
to
me
my
father
and
my
eldest
brother
brought
me
two
pieces
of
cloth
my
father
a
good
but
stern
man
and
who
had
been
much
averse
to
my
entering
the
convent
had
told
me
when
we
parted
that
he
would
willingly
pay
for
my
burial
but
that
he
would
give
nothing
for
the
convent
and
he
kept
his
word
for
this
piece
of
cloth
was
the
winding
sheet
used
for
my
spiritual
burial
in
the
convent
was
not
thinking
of
myself
she
says
again
was
thinking
of
nothing
but
our
lord
and
my
holy
vows
my
companions
could
not
understand
me
nor
could
i
explain
my
state
to
them
god
concealed
from
them
many
of
the
favours
which
he
bestowed
upon
me
otherwise
they
would
have
had
very
false
ideas
concerning
me
notwithstanding
all
my
trials
and
sufferings
i
was
never
more
rich
interiorly
and
my
soul
was
perfectly
flooded
with
happiness
my
cell
only
contained
one
chair
without
a
seat
and
another
without
a
back
yet
in
my
eyes
it
was
magnificently
furnished
and
when
there
i
often
thought
myself
in
heaven
frequently
during
the
night
impelled
by
love
and
by
the
mercy
of
god
i
poured
forth
the
feelings
of
my
soul
by
conversing
with
him
on
loving
and
familiar
language
as
i
had
always
done
from
my
childhood
and
then
those
who
were
watching
me
would
accuse
me
of
irreverence
and
disrespect
towards
god
once
i
happened
to
say
that
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
should
be
guilty
of
greater
disrespect
did
i
receive
the
body
of
our
lord
without
having
conversed
familiarly
with
him
and
i
was
severely
reprimanded
amid
all
these
trials
i
yet
lived
in
peace
with
god
and
with
all
his
creatures
when
i
was
working
in
the
garden
the
birds
would
come
and
rest
on
my
head
and
shoulders
and
we
would
together
sing
the
praises
of
god
i
always
beheld
my
at
my
side
and
although
the
devil
used
frequently
to
assault
and
terrify
me
in
various
ways
he
was
never
permitted
to
do
me
much
harm
my
desire
for
the
blessed
sacrament
was
so
irresistible
that
often
at
night
i
left
my
cell
and
went
to
the
church
if
it
was
open
but
if
not
i
remained
at
the
door
or
by
the
walls
even
in
winter
kneeling
or
prostrate
with
my
arms
extended
in
ecstasy
the
convent
chaplain
who
was
so
charitable
as
to
come
early
to
give
me
the
holy
communion
used
to
find
me
in
this
state
but
as
soon
as
he
was
come
and
had
opened
the
church
i
always
recovered
and
hastened
to
the
holy
table
there
to
receive
my
lord
and
my
god
when
i
was
sacristan
i
used
all
on
a
sudden
to
feel
myself
ravished
in
spirit
and
ascend
to
the
highest
parts
of
the
church
on
to
cornices
projecting
parts
of
the
building
and
mouldings
where
it
seemed
impossible
for
any
being
to
get
by
human
means
then
i
cleaned
and
arranged
everything
and
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
was
surrounded
by
blessed
spirits
who
transported
me
about
and
held
me
up
in
their
hands
their
presence
did
not
cause
me
the
least
uneasiness
for
i
had
been
accustomed
to
it
from
my
childhood
and
i
used
to
have
the
most
sweet
and
familiar
intercourse
with
them
it
was
only
when
i
was
in
the
company
of
certain
men
that
i
was
really
alone
and
so
great
was
then
my
feeling
of
loneliness
that
i
could
not
help
crying
like
a
child
that
has
strayed
from
home
we
now
proceed
to
her
illnesses
omitting
any
description
of
some
other
remarkable
phenomena
of
her
ecstatic
life
only
recommending
the
reader
to
compare
the
accounts
we
have
already
given
with
what
is
related
of
mary
magdalen
of
pazzi
anne
catherine
had
always
been
weak
and
delicate
and
yet
had
been
from
her
earliest
childhood
in
the
habit
of
practising
many
mortifications
of
fasting
and
of
passing
the
night
in
watching
and
prayer
in
the
open
air
she
had
been
accustomed
to
continue
hard
labour
in
the
fields
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
and
her
strength
was
also
necessarily
much
tried
by
the
exhausting
and
supernatural
states
through
which
she
so
frequently
passed
at
the
convent
she
continued
to
work
in
the
garden
and
in
the
house
whilst
her
spiritual
labours
and
sufferings
were
ever
on
the
increase
so
that
it
is
by
no
means
surprising
that
she
was
frequently
ill
but
her
illnesses
arose
from
yet
another
cause
we
have
learned
from
careful
observations
made
every
day
for
the
space
of
four
years
and
also
from
what
she
herself
was
unwillingly
forced
to
admit
that
during
the
whole
course
of
her
life
and
especially
during
that
part
of
it
which
she
spent
at
the
convent
when
she
enjoyed
the
highest
spiritual
favours
a
great
portion
of
her
illnesses
and
sufferings
came
from
taking
upon
herself
the
sufferings
of
others
sometimes
she
asked
for
the
illness
of
a
person
who
did
not
bear
it
patiently
and
relieved
him
of
the
whole
or
of
a
part
of
his
sufferings
by
taking
them
upon
herself
sometimes
wishing
to
expiate
a
sin
or
put
an
end
to
some
suffering
she
gave
herself
up
into
the
hands
of
god
and
he
accepting
her
sacrifice
permitted
her
thus
in
union
with
the
merits
of
his
passion
to
expiate
the
sin
by
suffering
some
illness
corresponding
to
it
she
had
consequently
to
bear
not
only
her
own
maladies
but
those
also
of
others
to
suffer
in
expiation
of
the
sins
of
her
brethren
and
of
the
faults
and
negligences
of
certain
portions
of
the
christian
community
and
finally
to
endure
many
and
various
sufferings
in
satisfaction
for
the
souls
of
purgatory
all
these
sufferings
appeared
like
real
illnesses
which
took
the
most
opposite
and
variable
forms
and
she
was
placed
entirely
under
the
care
of
the
doctor
who
endeavoured
by
earthly
remedies
to
cure
illnesses
which
in
reality
were
the
very
sources
of
her
life
she
said
on
this
subject
in
suffering
has
always
appeared
to
me
the
most
desirable
condition
possible
the
angels
themselves
would
envy
us
were
envy
not
an
imperfection
but
for
sufferings
to
bear
really
meritorious
we
must
patiently
and
gratefully
accept
unsuitable
remedies
and
comforts
and
all
other
additional
trials
i
did
not
myself
fully
understand
my
state
nor
know
what
it
was
to
lead
to
in
my
soul
i
accepted
my
different
sufferings
but
in
my
body
it
was
my
duty
to
strive
against
them
i
had
given
myself
wholly
and
entirely
to
my
heavenly
spouse
and
his
holy
will
was
being
accomplished
in
me
but
i
was
living
on
earth
where
i
was
not
to
rebel
against
earthly
wisdom
and
earthly
prescriptions
even
had
i
fully
comprehended
my
state
and
had
both
time
and
power
to
explain
it
there
was
no
one
near
who
would
have
been
able
to
understand
me
a
doctor
would
simply
have
concluded
that
i
was
entirely
mad
and
would
have
increased
his
expensive
and
painful
remedies
tenfold
i
have
suffered
much
in
this
way
during
the
whole
of
my
life
and
particularly
when
i
was
at
the
convent
from
having
unsuitable
remedies
administered
to
me
often
when
my
doctors
and
nurses
had
reduced
me
to
the
last
agony
and
that
i
was
near
death
god
took
pity
on
me
and
sent
me
some
supernatural
assistance
which
effected
an
entire
cure
four
years
before
the
suppression
of
her
convent
she
went
to
flamske
for
two
days
to
visit
her
parents
whilst
there
she
went
once
to
kneel
and
pray
for
some
hours
before
the
miraculous
cross
of
the
church
of
lambert
at
coesfeld
she
besought
the
almighty
to
bestow
the
gifts
of
peace
and
unity
upon
her
convent
offered
him
the
passion
of
jesus
christ
for
that
intention
and
implored
him
to
allow
her
to
feel
a
portion
of
the
sufferings
which
were
endured
by
her
divine
spouse
on
the
cross
from
the
time
that
she
made
this
prayer
her
hands
and
feet
became
burning
and
painful
and
she
suffered
constantly
from
fever
which
she
believed
was
the
cause
of
the
pain
in
her
hands
and
feet
for
she
did
not
dare
to
think
that
her
prayer
had
been
granted
often
she
was
unable
to
walk
and
the
pain
in
her
hands
prevented
her
from
working
as
usual
in
the
garden
on
the
december
the
convent
was
suppressed
and
the
church
closed
under
the
government
of
jerome
bonaparte
king
of
westphalia
the
nuns
dispersed
in
all
directions
but
anne
catherine
remained
poor
and
a
kindhearted
servant
belonging
to
the
monastery
attended
upon
her
out
of
charity
and
an
aged
emigrant
priest
who
said
mass
in
the
convent
remained
also
with
her
these
three
individuals
being
the
poorest
of
the
community
did
not
leave
the
convent
until
the
spring
of
she
was
still
very
unwell
and
could
not
be
moved
without
great
difficulty
the
priest
lodged
with
a
poor
widow
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
and
anne
catherine
had
in
the
same
house
a
wretched
little
room
on
the
which
looked
on
the
street
there
she
lived
in
poverty
and
sickness
until
the
autumn
of
her
ecstasies
in
prayer
and
her
spiritual
intercourse
with
the
invisible
world
became
more
and
more
frequent
she
was
about
to
be
called
to
a
state
with
which
she
was
herself
but
imperfectly
acquainted
and
in
order
to
enter
which
she
did
nothing
but
submissively
abandon
herself
to
the
will
of
god
our
lord
was
pleased
about
this
time
to
imprint
upon
her
virginal
body
the
stigmas
of
his
cross
and
of
his
crucifixion
which
were
to
the
jews
a
and
to
the
gentiles
folly
and
to
many
persons
who
call
themselves
christians
both
the
one
and
the
other
from
her
very
earliest
childhood
she
had
besought
our
lord
to
impress
the
marks
of
his
cross
deeply
upon
her
heart
that
so
she
might
never
forget
his
infinite
love
for
men
but
she
had
never
thought
of
receiving
any
outward
marks
rejected
by
the
world
she
prayed
more
fervently
than
ever
for
this
end
on
the
of
august
the
feast
of
augustine
the
patron
of
her
order
as
she
was
making
this
prayer
in
bed
ravished
in
ecstasy
and
her
arms
stretched
forth
she
beheld
a
young
man
approach
her
surrounded
with
light
it
was
under
this
form
that
her
divine
spouse
usually
appeared
to
her
and
he
now
made
upon
her
body
with
his
right
hand
the
mark
of
a
common
cross
from
this
time
there
was
a
mark
like
a
cross
upon
her
bosom
consisting
of
two
bands
crossed
about
three
inches
long
and
one
wide
later
the
skin
often
rose
in
blisters
on
this
place
as
if
from
a
burn
and
when
these
blisters
burst
a
burning
colourless
liquid
issued
from
them
sometimes
in
such
quantities
as
to
soak
through
several
sheets
she
was
long
without
perceiving
what
the
case
really
was
and
only
thought
that
she
was
in
a
strong
perspiration
the
particular
meaning
of
this
mark
has
never
been
known
some
weeks
later
when
making
the
same
prayer
she
fell
into
an
ecstasy
and
beheld
the
same
apparition
which
presented
her
with
a
little
cross
of
the
shape
described
in
her
accounts
of
the
passion
she
eagerly
received
and
fervently
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
and
then
returned
it
she
said
that
this
cross
was
as
soft
and
white
as
wax
but
she
was
not
at
first
aware
that
it
had
made
an
external
mark
upon
her
bosom
a
short
time
after
having
gone
with
her
landlady
little
girl
to
visit
an
old
hermitage
near
dulmen
she
all
on
a
sudden
fell
into
an
ecstasy
fainted
away
and
on
her
recovery
was
taken
home
by
a
poor
peasant
woman
the
sharp
pain
which
she
felt
in
her
chest
continued
to
increase
and
she
saw
that
there
was
what
looked
like
a
cross
about
three
inches
in
length
pressed
tightly
upon
her
and
looking
red
through
the
skin
as
she
had
spoken
about
her
vision
to
a
nun
with
whom
she
was
intimate
her
extraordinary
state
began
to
be
a
good
deal
talked
of
on
all
souls
day
she
went
out
for
the
last
time
and
with
much
difficulty
succeeded
in
reaching
the
church
from
that
time
till
the
end
of
the
year
she
seemed
to
be
dying
and
received
the
last
sacraments
at
christmas
a
smaller
cross
appeared
on
the
top
of
that
upon
her
chest
it
was
the
same
shape
as
the
larger
one
so
that
the
two
together
formed
a
double
forked
cross
blood
flowed
from
this
cross
every
wednesday
so
as
to
leave
the
impression
of
its
shape
on
paper
laid
over
it
after
a
time
this
happened
on
fridays
instead
in
this
flow
of
blood
took
place
less
frequently
but
the
cross
became
as
red
as
fire
every
friday
at
a
later
period
of
her
life
more
blood
flowed
from
this
cross
especially
every
good
friday
but
no
attention
was
paid
to
it
on
the
march
the
writer
of
these
pages
saw
this
cross
of
a
deep
red
colour
and
bleeding
all
over
in
its
usual
state
it
was
colourless
and
its
position
only
marked
by
slight
cracks
in
the
skin
other
ecstaticas
have
received
similar
marks
of
the
cross
among
others
catherine
of
raconis
marina
de
l
escobar
emilia
bichieri
juliani
falconieri
etc
she
received
the
stigmas
on
the
last
days
of
the
year
on
the
december
about
three
in
the
afternoon
she
was
lying
on
her
bed
in
her
little
room
extremely
ill
but
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
and
with
her
arms
extended
meditating
on
the
sufferings
of
her
lord
and
beseeching
him
to
allow
her
to
suffer
with
him
she
said
five
our
fathers
in
honour
of
the
five
wounds
and
felt
her
whole
heart
burning
with
love
she
then
saw
a
light
descending
towards
her
and
distinguished
in
the
midst
of
it
the
resplendent
form
of
her
crucified
saviour
whose
wounds
shone
like
so
many
furnaces
of
light
her
heart
was
overflowing
with
joy
and
sorrow
and
at
the
sight
of
the
sacred
wounds
her
desire
to
suffer
with
her
lord
became
intensely
violent
then
triple
rays
pointed
like
arrows
of
the
colour
of
blood
darted
forth
from
the
hands
feet
and
side
of
the
sacred
apparition
and
struck
her
hands
feet
and
right
side
the
triple
rays
from
the
side
formed
a
point
like
the
head
of
a
lance
the
moment
these
rays
touched
her
drops
of
blood
flowed
from
the
wounds
which
they
made
long
did
she
remain
in
a
state
of
insensibility
and
when
she
recovered
her
senses
she
did
not
know
who
had
lowered
her
outstretched
arms
it
was
with
astonishment
that
she
beheld
blood
flowing
from
the
palms
of
her
hands
and
felt
violent
pain
in
her
feet
and
side
it
happened
that
her
landlady
little
daughter
came
into
her
room
saw
her
hands
bleeding
and
ran
to
tell
her
mother
who
with
great
anxiety
asked
anne
catherine
what
had
happened
but
was
begged
by
her
not
to
speak
about
it
she
felt
after
having
received
the
stigmas
that
an
entire
change
had
taken
place
in
her
body
for
the
course
of
her
blood
seemed
to
have
changed
and
to
flow
rapidly
towards
the
stigmas
she
herself
used
to
say
words
can
describe
in
what
manner
it
flows
we
are
indebted
to
a
curious
incident
for
our
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
which
we
have
here
related
on
the
december
she
had
a
detailed
vision
of
all
that
had
happened
to
herself
but
so
that
she
thought
it
concerned
some
other
nun
who
she
imagined
must
be
living
not
far
off
and
who
she
supposed
had
experienced
the
same
things
as
herself
she
related
all
these
details
with
a
very
strong
feeling
of
compassion
humbling
herself
without
knowing
it
before
her
own
patience
and
sufferings
it
was
most
touching
to
hear
her
say
ought
never
to
complain
anymore
now
that
i
have
seen
the
sufferings
of
that
poor
nun
her
heart
is
surrounded
with
a
crown
of
thorns
but
she
bears
it
placidly
and
with
a
smiling
countenance
it
is
shameful
indeed
for
me
to
complain
for
she
had
a
far
heavier
burden
to
bear
than
i
have
these
visions
which
she
afterwards
recognised
to
be
her
own
history
were
several
times
repeated
and
it
is
from
them
that
the
circumstances
under
which
she
received
the
stigmas
became
known
otherwise
she
would
not
have
related
so
many
particulars
about
what
her
humility
never
permitted
her
to
speak
of
and
concerning
which
when
asked
by
her
spiritual
superiors
whence
her
wounds
proceeded
the
utmost
she
said
was
hope
that
they
come
from
the
hand
of
god
the
limits
of
this
work
preclude
us
from
entering
upon
the
subject
of
stigmas
in
general
but
we
may
observe
that
the
catholic
church
has
produced
a
certain
number
of
persons
francis
of
assisi
being
the
first
who
have
attained
to
that
degree
of
contemplative
love
of
jesus
which
is
the
most
sublime
effect
of
union
with
his
sufferings
and
is
designated
by
theologians
vulnus
divinum
plago
amoris
viva
there
are
known
to
have
been
at
least
fifty
veronica
giuliani
a
capuchiness
who
died
at
citta
di
castello
in
is
the
last
individual
of
the
class
who
has
been
canonised
on
the
may
her
biography
published
at
cologne
in
gives
a
description
of
the
state
of
persons
with
stigmas
which
in
many
ways
is
applicable
to
anne
catherine
colomba
schanolt
who
died
at
bamberg
in
magdalen
lorger
who
died
at
hadamar
in
both
dominicanesses
and
rose
serra
a
capuchiness
at
ozieri
in
sardinia
who
received
the
stigmas
in
are
those
of
our
own
times
of
whom
we
know
the
most
josephine
kumi
of
the
convent
of
wesen
near
lake
wallenstadt
in
switzerland
who
was
still
living
in
also
belonged
to
this
class
of
persons
but
we
are
not
entirely
certain
whether
she
had
the
stigmas
anne
catherine
being
as
we
have
said
no
longer
able
to
walk
or
rise
from
her
bed
soon
became
unable
also
to
eat
before
long
she
could
take
nothing
but
a
little
wine
and
water
and
finally
only
pure
water
sometimes
but
very
rarely
she
managed
to
swallow
the
juice
of
a
cherry
or
a
plum
but
she
immediately
vomited
any
solid
food
taken
in
ever
so
small
a
quantity
this
inability
to
take
food
or
rather
this
faculty
of
living
for
a
great
length
of
time
upon
nothing
but
water
we
are
assured
by
learned
doctors
is
not
quite
unexampled
in
the
history
of
the
sick
theologians
will
be
perfectly
aware
that
here
are
many
instances
of
contemplative
ascetics
and
particularly
of
persons
frequently
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
and
who
have
received
the
stigmas
remaining
long
without
taking
any
other
food
than
the
blessed
sacrament
for
instance
nicholas
of
flue
liduvina
of
schiedam
catherine
of
sienna
angela
of
foligno
and
louise
de
all
the
phenomena
exhibited
in
the
person
of
anne
catherine
remained
concealed
even
from
those
who
had
the
most
intercourse
with
her
until
the
february
when
they
were
discovered
accidentally
by
one
of
her
old
convent
companions
by
the
end
of
march
the
whole
town
talked
of
them
on
the
of
march
the
physician
of
the
neighbourhood
forced
her
to
undergo
an
examination
contrary
to
his
expectation
he
was
convinced
of
the
truth
drew
up
an
official
report
of
what
he
had
seen
became
her
doctor
and
her
friend
and
remained
such
to
her
death
on
the
of
march
commissioners
were
appointed
to
examine
into
her
case
by
the
spiritual
authorities
of
munster
the
consequence
of
this
was
that
anne
catherine
was
henceforth
looked
upon
kindly
by
her
superiors
and
acquired
the
friendship
of
the
late
dean
overberg
who
from
that
time
paid
her
every
year
a
visit
of
several
days
duration
and
was
her
consoler
and
spiritual
director
the
medical
counsellor
from
druffel
who
was
present
at
this
examination
in
the
capacity
of
doctor
never
ceased
to
venerate
her
in
he
published
in
the
medical
journal
of
salzbourg
a
detailed
account
of
the
phenomena
which
he
had
remarked
in
the
person
of
anne
catherine
and
to
this
we
refer
those
of
our
readers
who
desire
more
particulars
upon
the
subject
on
the
of
april
garnier
the
of
the
french
police
came
from
munster
to
see
her
he
inquired
minutely
into
her
case
and
having
learned
that
she
neither
prophesied
nor
spoke
on
politics
declared
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
the
police
to
occupy
themselves
about
her
in
he
still
spoke
of
her
at
paris
with
respect
and
emotion
on
the
of
july
overberg
came
to
see
her
with
count
de
stolberg
and
his
family
they
remained
two
days
with
her
and
stolberg
in
a
letter
which
has
been
several
times
printed
bore
witness
to
the
reality
of
the
phenomena
observed
in
anne
catherine
and
gave
expression
to
his
intense
veneration
for
her
he
remained
her
friend
as
long
as
he
lived
and
the
members
of
his
family
never
ceased
recommending
themselves
to
her
prayers
on
the
of
september
overberg
took
the
daughter
of
the
princess
galitzin
who
died
in
to
visit
her
and
they
saw
with
their
own
eyes
blood
flow
copiously
from
her
stigmas
this
distinguished
lady
repeated
her
visit
and
after
becoming
princess
of
salm
never
varied
in
her
sentiments
but
together
with
her
family
remained
in
constant
communion
of
prayer
with
anne
catherine
many
other
persons
in
all
ranks
of
life
were
in
like
manner
consoled
and
edified
by
visiting
her
bed
of
suffering
on
the
of
october
she
was
carried
to
another
lodging
the
window
of
which
looked
out
upon
a
garden
the
condition
of
the
saintly
nun
became
day
by
day
more
painful
her
stigmas
were
a
source
of
indescribable
suffering
to
her
down
to
the
moment
of
her
death
instead
of
allowing
her
thoughts
to
dwell
upon
those
graces
to
the
interior
presence
of
which
they
bore
such
miraculous
outward
testimony
she
learned
from
them
lessons
of
humility
by
considering
them
as
a
heavy
cross
laid
upon
her
for
her
sins
her
suffering
body
itself
was
to
preach
jesus
crucified
it
was
difficult
indeed
to
be
an
enigma
to
all
persons
an
object
of
suspicion
to
the
greatest
number
and
of
respect
mingled
with
fear
to
some
few
without
yielding
to
sentiments
of
impatience
irritability
or
pride
willingly
would
she
have
lived
in
entire
seclusion
from
the
world
but
obedience
soon
compelled
her
to
allow
herself
to
be
examined
and
to
have
judgment
passed
upon
her
by
a
vast
number
of
curious
persons
suffering
as
she
was
the
most
excruciating
pains
she
was
not
even
allowed
to
be
her
own
mistress
but
was
regarded
as
something
which
everyone
fancied
he
had
a
right
to
look
at
and
to
pass
judgment
upon
often
with
no
good
results
to
anyone
but
greatly
to
the
prejudice
of
her
soul
and
body
because
she
was
thus
deprived
of
so
much
rest
and
recollection
of
spirit
there
seemed
to
be
no
bounds
to
what
was
expected
of
her
and
one
fat
man
who
had
some
difficulty
in
ascending
her
narrow
winding
staircase
was
heard
to
complain
that
a
person
like
anne
catherine
who
ought
to
be
exposed
on
the
public
road
where
everyone
could
see
her
should
remained
in
a
lodging
so
difficult
to
reach
in
former
ages
persons
in
her
state
underwent
in
private
the
examination
of
the
spiritual
authorities
and
carried
out
their
painful
vocation
beneath
the
protecting
shadow
of
hallowed
walls
but
our
suffering
heroine
had
been
cast
forth
from
the
cloister
into
the
world
at
a
time
when
pride
coldness
of
heart
and
incredulity
were
all
the
vogue
marked
with
the
stigmas
of
the
passion
of
christ
she
was
forced
to
wear
her
bloody
robe
in
public
under
the
eyes
of
men
who
scarce
believed
in
the
wounds
of
christ
far
less
in
those
which
were
but
their
images
thus
this
holy
woman
who
in
her
youth
had
been
in
the
habit
of
praying
for
long
hours
before
pictures
of
all
the
stages
of
painful
passion
or
before
wayside
crosses
was
herself
made
like
unto
a
cross
on
the
public
road
insulted
by
one
passer
by
bathed
in
warm
tears
of
repentance
by
a
second
regarded
as
a
mere
physical
curiosity
by
a
third
and
venerated
by
a
fourth
whose
innocent
hands
would
bring
flowers
to
lay
at
her
feet
in
her
aged
mother
came
from
the
country
to
die
by
her
side
anne
catherine
showed
her
all
the
love
she
could
by
comforting
and
praying
for
her
and
closing
her
eyes
with
her
own
hands
those
hands
marked
with
the
stigmas
on
the
of
march
of
the
same
year
the
inheritance
left
to
anne
catherine
by
her
mother
was
more
than
sufficient
for
one
so
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
mortification
and
sufferings
and
in
her
turn
she
left
it
unimpaired
to
her
friends
it
consisted
of
these
three
sayings
thy
will
not
mine
be
done
give
me
patience
and
then
strike
hard
things
which
are
not
good
to
put
in
the
pot
are
at
least
good
to
put
beneath
it
the
meaning
of
this
last
proverb
was
if
things
are
not
fit
to
be
eaten
they
may
at
least
be
burned
in
order
that
food
may
be
cooked
this
suffering
does
not
nourish
my
heart
but
by
bearing
it
patiently
i
may
at
least
increase
the
fire
of
divine
love
by
which
alone
life
can
profit
us
anything
she
often
repeated
these
proverbs
and
then
thought
of
her
mother
with
gratitude
her
father
had
died
some
little
time
before
the
writer
of
these
pages
became
acquainted
with
her
state
first
through
reading
a
copy
of
that
letter
of
stolberg
to
which
we
have
already
alluded
and
afterwards
through
conversation
with
a
friend
who
had
passed
several
weeks
with
her
in
september
he
was
invited
by
bishop
sailer
to
meet
him
at
the
count
de
stolberg
in
westphalia
and
he
went
in
the
first
place
to
sondermuhlen
to
see
the
count
who
introduced
him
to
overberg
from
whom
he
received
a
letter
addressed
to
anne
catherine
doctor
he
paid
her
his
first
visit
on
the
of
september
and
she
allowed
him
to
pass
several
hours
by
her
side
each
day
until
the
arrival
of
sailer
from
the
very
beginning
she
gave
him
her
confidence
to
a
remarkable
extent
and
this
in
the
most
touching
and
ingenuous
manner
no
doubt
she
was
conscious
that
by
relating
without
reserve
the
history
of
all
the
trials
joys
and
sorrows
of
her
whole
life
she
was
bestowing
a
most
precious
spiritual
alms
upon
him
she
treated
him
with
the
most
generous
hospitality
and
had
no
hesitation
in
doing
so
because
he
did
not
oppress
her
and
alarm
her
humility
by
excessive
admiration
she
laid
open
her
interior
to
him
in
the
same
charitable
spirit
as
a
pious
solitary
would
in
the
morning
offer
the
flowers
and
fruit
which
had
grown
in
his
garden
during
the
night
to
some
traveller
who
having
lost
his
road
in
the
desert
of
the
world
finds
him
sitting
near
his
hermitage
wholly
devoted
to
her
god
she
spoke
in
this
open
manner
as
a
child
would
have
done
unsuspectingly
with
no
feelings
of
mistrust
and
with
no
selfish
end
in
view
may
god
reward
her
her
friend
daily
wrote
down
all
the
observations
that
he
made
concerning
her
and
all
that
she
told
him
about
her
life
whether
interior
or
exterior
her
words
were
characterised
alternately
by
the
most
childlike
simplicity
and
the
most
astonishing
depth
of
thought
and
they
foreshadowed
as
it
were
the
vast
and
sublime
spectacle
which
later
was
unfolded
when
it
became
evident
that
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
together
with
all
that
pertained
to
the
sanctification
profanation
and
judgment
of
souls
formed
before
and
within
her
an
allegorical
and
historical
drama
for
which
the
different
events
of
the
ecclesiastical
year
furnished
subjects
and
which
it
divided
into
scenes
so
closely
linked
together
were
all
the
prayers
and
sufferings
which
she
offered
in
sacrifice
for
the
church
militant
on
the
of
october
sailer
came
to
see
her
and
having
remarked
that
she
was
lodging
at
the
back
of
a
public
house
and
that
men
were
playing
at
under
her
window
said
in
the
playful
yet
thoughtful
manner
which
was
peculiar
to
him
see
all
things
are
as
they
should
be
the
invalid
nun
the
spouse
of
our
lord
is
lodging
in
a
publichouse
above
the
ground
where
men
are
playing
at
like
the
soul
of
man
in
his
body
his
interview
with
anne
catherine
was
most
affecting
it
was
indeed
beautiful
to
behold
these
two
souls
who
were
both
on
fire
with
the
love
of
jesus
and
conducted
by
grace
through
such
different
paths
meet
thus
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
the
visible
stamp
of
which
was
borne
by
one
of
them
on
friday
the
of
october
sailer
remained
alone
with
her
during
nearly
the
whole
of
the
day
he
saw
blood
flow
from
her
head
her
hands
and
her
feet
and
he
was
able
to
bestow
upon
her
great
consolation
in
her
interior
trials
he
most
earnestly
recommended
her
to
tell
everything
without
reserve
to
the
writer
of
these
pages
and
he
came
to
an
understanding
upon
the
subject
with
her
ordinary
director
he
heard
her
confession
gave
her
the
holy
communion
on
saturday
the
and
then
continued
his
journey
to
the
count
de
stolberg
on
his
return
at
the
beginning
of
november
he
again
passed
a
day
with
her
he
remained
her
friend
until
death
prayed
constantly
for
her
and
asked
her
prayers
whenever
he
found
himself
in
trying
of
difficult
positions
the
writer
of
these
pages
remained
until
january
he
returned
in
may
and
continued
to
watch
anne
catherine
almost
uninterruptedly
until
her
death
the
saintly
maiden
continually
besought
the
almighty
to
remove
the
exterior
stigmas
on
account
of
the
trouble
and
fatigue
which
they
occasioned
and
her
prayer
was
granted
at
the
end
of
seven
years
towards
the
conclusion
of
the
year
the
blood
first
flowed
less
frequently
from
her
wounds
and
then
ceased
altogether
on
the
of
december
scabs
fell
from
her
feet
and
hands
and
there
only
remained
white
scars
which
became
red
on
certain
days
but
the
pain
she
suffered
was
undiminished
in
the
slightest
degree
the
mark
of
the
cross
and
the
wound
on
her
right
side
were
often
to
be
seen
as
before
but
not
at
any
stated
times
on
certain
days
she
always
had
the
most
painful
sensations
around
her
head
as
though
a
crown
of
thorns
were
being
pressed
upon
it
on
these
occasions
she
could
not
lean
her
head
against
anything
nor
even
rest
it
on
her
hand
but
had
to
remain
for
long
hours
sometimes
even
for
whole
nights
sitting
up
in
her
bed
supported
by
cushions
whilst
her
pallid
face
and
the
irrepressible
groans
of
pain
which
escaped
her
made
her
like
an
awful
living
representation
of
suffering
after
she
had
been
in
this
state
blood
invariably
flowed
more
or
less
copiously
from
around
her
head
sometimes
her
only
was
soaked
with
it
but
sometimes
the
blood
would
flow
down
her
face
and
neck
on
good
friday
april
all
her
wounds
and
bled
and
closed
again
on
the
following
days
a
most
rigorous
inquiry
into
her
state
was
made
by
some
doctors
and
naturalists
for
that
end
she
was
placed
alone
in
a
strange
house
where
she
remained
from
the
to
the
of
august
but
this
examination
appears
to
have
produced
no
particular
effects
in
any
way
she
was
brought
back
to
her
own
dwelling
on
the
of
august
and
from
that
time
until
she
died
she
was
left
in
peace
save
that
she
was
occasionally
annoyed
by
private
disputes
and
public
insults
on
this
subject
overberg
wrote
her
the
following
words
have
you
had
to
suffer
personally
of
which
you
can
complain
i
am
addressing
a
soul
desirous
of
nothing
so
much
as
to
become
more
and
more
like
to
her
divine
spouse
have
you
not
been
treated
far
more
gently
than
was
your
adorable
spouse
should
it
not
be
a
subject
of
rejoicing
to
you
according
to
the
spirit
to
have
been
assisted
to
resemble
him
more
closely
and
thus
to
be
more
pleasing
in
his
eyes
you
had
suffered
much
with
jesus
but
hitherto
insults
had
been
for
the
most
part
spared
you
with
the
crown
of
thorns
you
had
not
worn
the
purple
mantle
and
the
robe
of
scorn
much
less
had
you
yet
heard
away
with
him
crucify
him
crucify
him
i
can
not
doubt
but
that
these
sentiments
are
yours
praise
be
to
jesus
christ
on
good
friday
the
of
march
blood
flowed
from
her
head
feet
hands
chest
and
side
it
happened
that
when
she
fainted
one
of
the
persons
who
were
with
her
knowing
that
the
application
of
relics
relieved
her
placed
near
her
feet
a
piece
of
linen
in
which
some
were
wrapped
and
the
blood
which
came
from
her
wounds
reached
this
piece
of
linen
after
a
time
in
the
evening
when
this
same
piece
of
linen
with
the
relics
was
being
placed
on
her
chest
and
shoulders
in
which
she
was
suffering
much
she
suddenly
exclaimed
while
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
is
most
wonderful
but
i
see
my
heavenly
spouse
lying
in
the
tomb
in
the
earthly
jerusalem
and
i
also
see
him
living
in
the
heavenly
jerusalem
surrounded
by
adoring
saints
and
in
the
midst
of
these
saints
i
see
a
person
who
is
not
a
saint
a
nun
blood
flows
from
her
head
her
side
her
hands
and
her
feet
and
the
saints
are
above
the
bleeding
parts
on
the
february
she
fell
into
an
ecstasy
at
the
time
of
the
funeral
of
a
very
holy
priest
blood
flowed
from
her
forehead
and
the
cross
on
her
breast
bled
also
someone
asked
her
is
the
matter
with
you
she
smiled
and
spoke
like
one
awakening
from
a
dream
were
by
the
side
of
the
body
i
have
been
accustomed
lately
to
hear
sacred
music
and
the
de
profundis
made
a
great
impression
upon
me
she
died
upon
the
same
day
three
years
later
in
a
few
weeks
before
easter
she
told
us
that
it
had
been
said
to
her
during
her
prayer
notice
you
will
suffer
on
the
real
anniversary
of
the
passion
and
not
on
the
day
marked
this
year
in
the
ecclesiastical
calendar
on
friday
the
of
march
at
ten
in
the
morning
she
sank
down
senseless
her
face
and
bosom
were
bathed
in
blood
and
her
body
appeared
covered
with
bruises
like
what
the
blows
of
a
whip
would
have
inflicted
at
twelve
in
the
day
she
stretched
herself
out
in
the
form
of
a
cross
and
her
arms
were
so
extended
as
to
be
perfectly
dislocated
a
few
minutes
before
two
drops
of
blood
flowed
from
her
feet
and
hands
on
good
friday
the
of
april
she
was
simply
in
a
state
of
quiet
contemplation
this
remarkable
exception
to
the
general
rule
seemed
to
be
an
effect
of
the
providence
of
god
for
at
the
hour
when
her
wounds
usually
bled
a
number
of
curious
and
individuals
came
to
see
her
with
the
intention
of
causing
her
fresh
annoyances
by
publishing
what
they
saw
but
they
thus
were
made
unintentionally
to
contribute
to
her
peace
by
saying
that
her
wounds
had
ceased
to
bleed
on
the
of
february
she
was
again
warned
that
she
would
suffer
on
the
last
friday
of
march
and
not
on
good
friday
on
friday
the
and
again
on
friday
the
the
cross
on
her
bosom
and
the
wound
of
her
side
bled
before
the
she
more
than
once
felt
as
though
a
stream
of
fire
were
flowing
rapidly
from
her
heart
to
her
side
and
down
her
arms
and
legs
to
the
stigmas
which
looked
red
and
inflamed
on
the
evening
of
thursday
the
she
fell
into
a
state
of
contemplation
on
the
passion
and
remained
in
it
until
friday
evening
her
chest
head
and
side
bled
all
the
veins
of
her
hands
were
swollen
and
there
was
a
painful
spot
in
the
centre
of
them
which
felt
damp
although
blood
did
not
flow
from
it
no
blood
flowed
from
the
stigmas
excepting
upon
the
of
march
the
day
of
the
finding
of
the
holy
cross
she
had
also
a
vision
of
the
discovery
of
the
true
cross
by
helena
and
imagined
herself
to
be
lying
in
the
excavation
near
the
cross
much
blood
came
in
the
morning
from
her
head
and
side
and
in
the
afternoon
from
her
hands
and
feet
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
she
were
being
made
the
test
of
whether
the
cross
was
really
the
cross
of
jesus
christ
and
that
her
blood
was
testifying
to
its
identity
in
the
year
on
holy
thursday
and
good
friday
which
came
on
the
and
of
march
she
had
visions
of
the
passion
during
which
blood
flowed
from
all
her
wounds
causing
her
intense
pain
amid
these
awful
sufferings
although
ravished
in
spirit
she
was
obliged
to
speak
and
give
answers
concerning
all
her
little
household
affairs
as
if
she
had
been
perfectly
strong
and
well
and
she
never
let
fall
a
complaint
although
nearly
dying
this
was
the
last
time
that
her
blood
gave
testimony
to
the
reality
of
her
union
with
the
sufferings
of
him
who
has
delivered
himself
up
wholly
and
entirely
for
our
salvation
most
of
the
phenomena
of
the
ecstatic
life
which
are
shown
us
in
the
lives
and
writings
of
saints

and
many
other
nuns
of
contemplative
orders
are
also
to
be
found
in
the
history
of
the
interior
life
of
anne
catherine
emmerich
the
same
path
was
marked
out
for
her
by
god
did
she
like
these
holy
women
attain
the
end
god
alone
knows
our
part
is
only
to
pray
that
such
may
have
been
the
case
and
we
are
allowed
to
hope
it
those
among
our
readers
who
are
not
acquainted
with
the
ecstatic
life
from
the
writings
of
those
who
have
lived
it
will
find
information
on
this
subject
in
the
introduction
of
goerres
to
the
writings
of
henry
suso
published
at
ratisbonne
in
since
many
pious
christians
in
order
to
render
their
life
one
perpetual
act
of
adoration
endeavour
to
see
in
their
daily
employments
a
symbolical
representation
of
some
manner
of
honouring
god
and
offer
it
to
him
in
union
with
the
merits
of
christ
it
can
not
appear
extraordinary
that
those
holy
souls
who
pass
from
an
active
life
to
one
of
suffering
and
contemplation
should
sometimes
see
their
spiritual
labours
under
the
form
of
those
earthly
occupations
which
formerly
filled
their
days
then
their
acts
were
prayers
now
their
prayers
are
acts
but
the
form
remains
the
same
it
was
thus
that
anne
catherine
in
her
ecstatic
life
beheld
the
series
of
her
prayers
for
the
church
under
the
forms
of
parables
bearing
reference
to
agriculture
gardening
weaving
sowing
or
the
care
of
sheep
all
these
different
occupations
were
arranged
according
to
their
signification
in
the
different
periods
of
the
common
as
well
as
the
ecclesiastical
year
and
were
pursued
under
the
patronage
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
saints
of
each
day
the
special
graces
of
the
corresponding
feasts
of
the
church
being
also
applied
to
them
the
signification
of
this
circles
of
symbols
had
reference
to
all
the
active
part
of
her
interior
life
one
example
will
help
to
explain
our
meaning
when
anne
catherine
while
yet
a
child
was
employed
in
weeding
she
besought
god
to
root
up
the
cockle
from
the
field
of
the
church
if
her
hands
were
stung
by
the
nettles
or
if
she
was
obliged
to
do
afresh
the
work
of
idlers
she
offered
to
god
her
pain
and
her
fatigue
and
besought
him
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
that
the
pastor
of
souls
might
not
become
weary
and
that
none
of
them
might
cease
to
labour
zealously
and
diligently
thus
her
manual
labour
became
a
prayer
i
will
now
give
a
corresponding
example
of
her
life
of
contemplation
and
ecstasy
she
had
been
ill
several
times
and
in
a
state
of
almost
continual
ecstasy
during
which
she
often
moaned
and
moved
her
hands
like
a
person
employed
in
weeding
she
complained
one
morning
that
her
hands
and
arms
smarted
and
itched
and
on
examination
they
were
found
to
be
covered
with
blisters
like
what
would
have
been
produced
by
the
stinging
of
nettles
she
then
begged
several
persons
of
her
acquaintance
to
join
their
prayers
to
hers
for
a
certain
intention
the
next
day
her
hands
were
inflamed
and
painful
as
they
would
have
been
after
hard
work
and
when
asked
the
cause
she
replied
i
have
so
many
nettles
to
root
up
in
the
vineyard
because
those
whose
duty
it
was
to
do
it
only
pulled
off
the
stems
and
i
was
obliged
to
draw
the
roots
with
much
difficulty
out
of
a
stony
soil
the
person
who
had
asked
her
the
question
began
to
blame
these
careless
workmen
but
he
felt
much
confused
when
she
replied
were
one
of
them
those
who
only
pull
off
the
stems
of
the
nettles
and
leave
the
roots
in
the
earth
are
persons
who
pray
carelessly
it
was
afterwards
discovered
that
she
had
been
praying
for
several
dioceses
which
were
shown
to
her
under
the
figure
of
vineyards
laid
waste
and
in
which
labour
was
needed
the
real
inflammation
of
her
hands
bore
testimony
to
this
symbolical
rooting
up
of
the
nettles
and
we
have
perhaps
reason
to
hope
that
the
churches
shown
to
her
under
the
appearances
of
vineyards
experienced
the
good
effects
of
her
prayer
and
spiritual
labour
for
since
the
door
is
opened
to
those
who
knock
it
must
certainly
be
opened
above
all
to
those
who
knock
with
such
energy
as
to
cause
their
fingers
to
be
wounded
similar
reactions
of
the
spirit
upon
the
body
are
often
found
in
the
lives
of
persons
subject
to
ecstasies
and
are
by
no
means
contrary
to
faith
paula
if
we
may
believe
jerome
visited
the
holy
places
in
spirit
just
as
if
she
had
visited
them
bodily
and
a
like
thing
happened
to
colomba
of
rieti
and
lidwina
of
schiedam
the
body
of
the
latter
bore
tracks
of
this
spiritual
journey
as
if
she
had
really
travelled
she
experienced
all
the
fatigue
that
a
painful
journey
would
cause
her
feet
were
wounded
and
covered
with
marks
which
looked
as
if
they
had
been
made
by
stones
or
thorns
and
finally
she
had
a
sprain
from
which
she
long
suffered
she
was
led
on
this
journey
by
her
guardian
angel
who
told
her
that
these
corporeal
wounds
signified
that
she
had
been
ravished
in
body
and
spirit
similar
hurts
were
also
to
be
seen
upon
the
body
of
anne
catherine
immediately
after
some
of
her
visions
lidwina
began
her
ecstatic
journey
by
following
her
good
angel
to
the
chapel
of
the
blessed
virgin
before
schiedam
anne
catherine
began
hers
by
following
her
angel
guardian
either
to
the
chapel
which
was
near
her
dwelling
or
else
to
the
way
of
the
cross
of
coesfeld
her
journeys
to
the
holy
land
were
made
according
to
the
accounts
she
gave
of
them
by
the
most
opposite
roads
sometimes
even
she
went
all
round
the
earth
when
the
task
spiritually
imposed
upon
her
required
it
in
the
course
of
these
journeys
from
her
home
to
the
most
distant
countries
she
carried
assistance
to
many
persons
exercising
in
their
regard
works
of
mercy
both
corporal
and
spiritual
and
this
was
done
frequently
in
parables
at
the
end
of
a
year
she
would
go
over
the
same
ground
again
see
the
same
persons
and
give
an
account
of
their
spiritual
progress
or
of
their
relapse
into
sin
every
part
of
this
labour
always
bore
some
reference
to
the
church
and
to
the
kingdom
of
god
upon
earth
the
end
of
these
daily
pilgrimages
which
she
made
in
spirit
was
invariably
the
promised
land
every
part
of
which
she
examined
in
detail
and
which
she
saw
sometimes
in
its
present
state
and
sometimes
as
it
was
at
different
periods
of
sacred
history
for
her
distinguishing
characteristic
and
special
privilege
was
an
intuitive
knowledge
of
the
history
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
and
of
that
of
the
members
of
the
holy
family
and
of
all
the
saints
whom
she
was
contemplating
in
spirit
she
saw
the
signification
of
all
the
festival
days
of
the
ecclesiastical
year
under
both
a
devotional
and
a
historical
point
of
view
she
saw
and
described
day
by
day
with
the
minutest
detail
and
by
name
places
persons
festivals
customs
and
miracles
all
that
happened
during
the
public
life
of
jesus
until
the
ascension
and
the
history
of
the
apostles
for
several
weeks
after
the
descent
of
the
holy
ghost
she
regarded
al
her
visions
not
as
mere
spiritual
enjoyments
but
as
being
so
to
speak
fertile
fields
plentifully
strewn
with
the
merits
of
christ
and
which
had
not
as
yet
been
cultivated
she
was
often
engaged
in
spirit
in
praying
that
the
fruit
of
such
and
such
sufferings
of
our
lord
might
be
given
to
the
church
and
she
would
beseech
god
to
apply
to
his
church
the
merits
of
our
saviour
which
were
its
inheritance
and
of
which
she
would
as
it
were
take
possession
in
its
name
with
the
most
touching
simplicity
and
ingenuousness
she
never
considered
her
visions
to
have
any
reference
to
her
exterior
christian
life
nor
did
she
regard
them
as
being
of
any
historical
value
exteriorly
she
knew
and
believed
nothing
but
the
catechism
the
common
history
of
the
bible
the
gospels
for
sundays
and
festivals
and
the
christian
almanac
which
to
her
vision
was
an
inexhaustible
mine
of
hidden
riches
since
it
gave
her
in
a
few
pages
a
guiding
thread
which
led
her
through
all
time
and
by
means
of
which
she
passed
from
mystery
to
mystery
and
solemnised
each
with
all
the
saints
in
order
to
reap
the
fruits
of
eternity
in
time
and
to
preserve
and
distribute
them
in
her
pilgrimage
around
the
ecclesiastical
year
that
so
the
will
of
god
might
be
accomplished
on
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
she
had
never
read
the
old
or
the
new
testaments
and
when
she
was
tired
of
relating
her
visions
she
would
sometimes
say
that
in
the
bible
and
then
be
astonished
to
learn
that
it
was
not
there
she
would
add
are
constantly
saying
in
these
days
that
you
need
read
nothing
but
the
bible
which
contains
everything
etc
the
real
task
of
her
life
was
to
suffer
for
the
church
and
for
some
of
its
members
whose
distress
was
shown
her
in
spirit
or
who
asked
her
prayers
without
knowing
that
this
poor
sick
nun
had
something
more
to
do
for
them
than
to
say
the
pater
noster
but
that
all
their
spiritual
and
corporal
sufferings
became
her
own
and
that
she
had
to
endure
patiently
the
most
terrible
pains
without
being
assisted
like
the
contemplatives
of
former
days
by
the
sympathising
prayers
of
an
entire
community
in
the
age
when
she
lived
she
had
no
other
assistance
than
that
of
medicine
while
thus
enduring
sufferings
which
she
had
taken
upon
herself
for
others
she
often
turned
her
thoughts
to
the
corresponding
sufferings
of
the
church
and
when
thus
suffering
for
one
single
person
she
would
likewise
offer
all
she
endured
for
the
whole
church
the
following
is
a
remarkable
instance
of
the
sort
during
several
weeks
she
had
every
symptom
of
consumption
violent
irritation
of
the
lungs
excessive
perspiration
which
soaked
her
whole
bed
a
racking
cough
continual
expectoration
and
a
strong
continual
fever
so
fearful
were
her
sufferings
that
her
death
was
hourly
expected
and
even
desired
it
was
remarked
that
she
had
to
struggle
strangely
against
a
strong
temptation
to
irritability
did
she
yield
for
an
instant
she
burst
into
tears
her
sufferings
increased
tenfold
and
she
seemed
unable
to
exist
unless
she
immediately
gained
pardon
in
the
sacrament
of
penance
she
had
also
to
combat
a
feeling
of
aversion
to
a
certain
person
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
years
she
was
in
despair
because
this
person
with
whom
nevertheless
she
declared
she
had
nothing
in
common
was
always
before
her
eyes
in
the
most
evil
dispositions
and
she
wept
bitterly
and
with
much
anxiety
of
conscience
saying
that
she
would
not
commit
sin
that
her
grief
must
be
evident
to
all
and
other
things
which
were
quite
unintelligible
to
the
persons
listening
to
her
her
illness
continued
to
increase
and
she
was
thought
to
be
on
the
point
of
death
at
this
moment
one
of
her
friends
saw
her
to
his
great
surprise
suddenly
raise
herself
up
on
her
bed
and
say
with
me
the
prayers
for
those
in
their
last
agony
he
did
as
requested
and
she
answered
the
litany
in
a
firm
voice
after
some
little
time
the
bell
for
the
agonising
was
heard
and
a
person
came
in
to
ask
anne
catherine
prayers
for
his
sister
who
was
just
dead
anne
catherine
asked
for
details
concerning
her
illness
and
death
as
if
deeply
interested
in
the
subject
and
the
friend
heard
the
account
given
by
the
new
comer
of
a
consumption
resembling
in
the
minutest
particulars
the
illness
of
anne
catherine
herself
the
deceased
woman
had
at
first
been
in
so
much
pain
and
so
disturbed
in
mind
that
she
had
seemed
quite
unable
to
prepare
herself
for
death
but
during
the
last
fortnight
she
had
been
better
had
made
her
peace
with
god
having
in
the
first
place
been
reconciled
to
a
person
with
whom
she
was
at
enmity
and
had
died
in
peace
fortified
by
the
last
sacraments
and
attended
by
her
former
enemy
anne
catherine
gave
a
small
sum
of
money
for
the
burial
and
of
this
person
her
sweatings
cough
and
fever
now
left
her
and
she
resembled
a
person
exhausted
with
fatigue
whose
linen
has
been
changed
and
who
has
been
placed
on
a
fresh
bed
her
friend
said
to
her
this
fearful
illness
came
upon
you
this
woman
grew
better
and
her
hatred
for
another
was
the
only
obstacle
to
her
making
peace
with
god
you
took
upon
yourself
for
the
time
her
feelings
of
hatred
she
died
in
good
dispositions
and
now
you
seem
tolerably
well
again
are
you
still
suffering
on
her
account
indeed
she
replied
would
be
most
unreasonable
but
how
can
any
person
avoid
suffering
when
even
the
end
of
this
little
finger
is
in
pain
we
are
all
one
body
in
christ
the
goodness
of
god
said
her
friend
are
now
once
more
somewhat
at
ease
for
very
long
though
she
replied
with
a
smile
are
other
persons
who
want
my
assistance
then
she
turned
round
on
her
bed
and
rested
awhile
a
very
few
days
later
she
began
to
feel
intense
pain
in
all
her
limbs
and
symptoms
of
water
on
the
chest
manifested
themselves
we
discovered
the
sick
person
for
whom
anne
catherine
was
suffering
and
we
saw
that
his
sufferings
suddenly
diminished
or
immensely
increased
in
exact
inverse
proportion
to
those
of
anne
catherine
thus
did
charity
compel
her
to
take
upon
herself
the
illnesses
and
even
the
temptations
of
others
that
they
might
be
able
in
peace
to
prepare
themselves
for
death
she
was
compelled
to
suffer
in
silence
both
to
conceal
the
weaknesses
of
her
neighbour
and
not
to
be
regarded
as
mad
herself
she
was
obliged
to
receive
all
the
aid
that
medicine
could
afford
her
for
an
illness
thus
taken
voluntarily
for
the
relief
of
others
and
to
be
reproached
for
temptations
which
were
not
her
own
finally
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
appear
perverted
in
the
eyes
of
men
that
so
those
for
whom
she
was
suffering
might
be
converted
before
god
one
day
a
friend
in
deep
affliction
was
sitting
by
her
bedside
when
she
suddenly
fell
into
a
state
of
ecstasy
and
began
to
pray
aloud
my
sweet
jesus
permit
me
to
carry
that
heavy
stone
her
friend
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
am
on
my
way
to
jerusalem
she
replied
i
see
a
poor
man
walking
along
with
the
greatest
difficulty
for
there
is
a
large
stone
upon
his
breast
the
weight
of
which
nearly
crushes
him
then
again
after
a
few
moments
she
exclaimed
me
that
heavy
stone
you
can
not
carry
it
any
farther
give
it
to
me
all
on
a
sudden
she
sank
down
fainting
as
if
crushed
beneath
some
heavy
burden
and
at
the
same
moment
her
friend
felt
himself
relieved
from
the
weight
of
sorrow
which
oppressed
him
and
his
heart
overflowing
with
extraordinary
happiness
seeing
her
in
such
a
state
of
suffering
he
asked
her
what
the
matter
was
and
she
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
replied
can
not
remain
here
any
longer
poor
man
you
must
take
back
your
burden
instantly
her
friend
felt
all
the
weight
of
his
affliction
return
to
him
whilst
she
becoming
as
well
again
as
before
continued
her
journey
in
spirit
to
jerusalem
we
will
give
one
more
example
of
her
spiritual
exertions
one
morning
she
gave
her
friend
a
little
bag
containing
some
and
eggs
and
pointed
out
to
him
a
small
house
where
a
poor
woman
who
was
in
a
consumption
was
living
with
her
husband
and
two
little
children
he
was
to
tell
her
to
boil
and
take
them
as
when
boiled
they
would
be
good
for
her
chest
the
friend
on
entering
the
cottage
took
the
bag
from
under
his
cloak
when
the
poor
mother
who
flushed
with
fever
was
lying
on
a
mattress
between
her
children
fixed
her
eyes
bright
upon
him
and
holding
out
her
thin
hands
exclaimed
sir
it
must
be
god
or
sister
emmerich
who
sends
you
to
me
you
are
bringing
me
some
ryeflour
and
eggs
here
the
poor
woman
overcome
by
her
feelings
burst
into
tears
and
then
began
to
cough
so
violently
that
she
had
to
make
a
sign
to
her
husband
to
speak
for
her
he
said
that
the
previous
night
gertrude
had
been
much
disturbed
and
had
talked
a
great
deal
in
her
sleep
and
that
on
awaking
she
had
told
him
her
dream
in
these
words
thought
that
i
was
standing
at
the
door
with
you
when
the
holy
nun
came
out
of
the
door
of
the
next
house
and
i
told
you
to
look
at
her
she
stopped
in
front
of
us
and
said
to
me
ah
gertrude
you
look
very
ill
i
will
send
you
some
and
eggs
which
will
relieve
your
chest
then
i
awoke
such
was
the
simple
tale
of
the
poor
man
he
and
his
wife
both
eagerly
expressed
their
gratitude
and
the
bearer
of
anne
catherine
alms
left
the
house
much
overcome
he
did
not
tell
her
anything
of
this
when
he
saw
her
but
a
few
days
after
she
sent
him
again
to
the
same
place
with
a
similar
present
and
he
then
asked
her
how
it
was
she
knew
that
poor
woman
know
she
replied
i
pray
every
evening
for
all
those
who
suffer
i
should
like
to
go
and
relieve
them
and
i
generally
dream
that
i
am
going
from
one
abode
of
suffering
to
another
and
that
i
assist
them
to
the
best
of
my
power
in
this
way
i
went
in
my
dream
to
that
poor
woman
house
she
was
standing
at
the
door
with
her
husband
and
i
said
to
her
ah
gertrude
you
look
very
ill
i
will
send
you
some
and
eggs
which
will
relieve
your
chest
and
this
i
did
through
you
the
next
morning
both
persons
had
remained
in
their
beds
and
dreamed
the
same
thing
and
the
dream
came
true
augustine
in
his
city
of
god
book
relates
a
similar
thing
of
two
philosophers
who
visited
each
other
in
a
dream
and
explained
some
passages
of
plato
both
remaining
asleep
in
their
own
houses
these
sufferings
and
this
peculiar
species
of
active
labour
were
like
a
single
ray
of
light
which
enlightened
her
whole
life
infinite
was
the
number
of
spiritual
labours
and
sympathetic
sufferings
which
came
from
all
parts
and
entered
into
her
heart
that
heart
so
burning
with
love
of
jesus
christ
like
catherine
of
sienna
and
some
other
ecstatics
she
often
felt
the
most
profound
feeling
of
conviction
that
our
saviour
had
taken
her
heart
out
of
her
bosom
and
placed
his
own
there
instead
for
a
time
the
following
fragment
will
give
some
idea
of
the
mysterious
symbolism
by
which
she
was
interiorly
directed
during
a
portion
of
the
year
she
performed
many
labours
in
spirit
for
several
different
parishes
her
prayers
being
represented
under
the
figure
of
most
severe
labour
in
a
vineyard
what
we
have
above
related
concerning
the
nettles
is
of
the
same
character
on
the
of
september
her
heavenly
guide
said
to
her
you
weeded
dug
around
tied
and
pruned
the
vine
you
ground
down
the
weeds
so
that
they
could
never
spring
up
anymore
and
then
you
went
away
joyfully
and
rested
from
your
prayers
prepare
now
to
labour
hard
from
the
feast
of
the
nativity
of
the
blessed
virgin
to
that
of
michael
the
grapes
are
ripening
and
must
be
well
watched
then
he
led
me
she
continued
the
vineyard
of
liboire
and
showed
me
the
vines
at
which
i
had
worked
my
labour
had
been
successful
for
the
grapes
were
getting
their
colour
and
growing
large
and
in
some
parts
the
red
juice
was
running
down
on
the
ground
from
them
my
guide
said
to
me
when
the
virtues
of
the
good
begin
to
shine
forth
in
public
they
have
to
combat
bravely
to
be
oppressed
to
be
tempted
and
to
suffer
persecution
a
hedge
must
be
planted
around
the
vineyard
in
order
that
the
ripe
grapes
may
not
be
destroyed
by
thieves
and
wild
beasts
by
temptation
and
persecution
he
then
showed
me
how
to
build
a
wall
by
heaping
up
stones
and
to
raise
a
thick
hedge
of
thorns
all
around
as
my
hands
bled
from
such
severe
labour
god
in
order
to
give
me
strength
permitted
me
to
see
the
mysterious
signification
of
the
vine
and
of
several
other
fruit
trees
jesus
christ
is
the
true
vine
who
is
to
take
root
and
grow
in
us
all
useless
wood
must
be
cut
away
in
order
not
to
waste
the
sap
which
is
to
become
the
wine
and
in
the
most
blessed
sacrament
the
blood
of
christ
the
pruning
of
the
vine
has
to
be
done
according
to
certain
rules
which
were
made
known
to
me
this
pruning
is
in
a
spiritual
sense
the
cutting
off
whatever
is
useless
penance
and
mortification
that
so
the
true
vine
may
grow
in
us
and
bring
forth
fruit
in
the
place
of
corrupt
nature
which
only
bears
wood
and
leaves
the
pruning
is
done
according
to
fixed
rules
for
it
is
only
required
that
certain
useless
shoots
should
be
cut
off
in
man
and
to
lop
off
more
would
be
to
mutilate
in
a
guilty
manner
no
pruning
should
ever
be
done
upon
the
stock
which
has
been
planted
in
humankind
through
the
blessed
virgin
and
is
to
remain
in
it
for
ever
the
true
vine
unites
heaven
to
earth
the
divinity
to
humanity
and
it
is
the
human
part
that
is
to
be
pruned
that
so
the
divine
alone
may
grow
i
saw
so
many
other
things
relating
to
the
vine
that
a
book
as
large
as
the
bible
could
not
contain
them
one
day
when
i
was
suffering
acute
pain
in
my
chest
i
besought
our
lord
with
groans
not
to
give
me
a
burthen
above
my
strength
to
bear
and
then
my
heavenly
spouse
appeared
and
said
to
me
i
have
laid
thee
on
my
nuptial
couch
which
is
a
couch
of
suffering
i
have
given
thee
suffering
and
expiation
for
thy
bridal
garments
and
jewels
thou
must
suffer
but
i
will
not
forsake
thee
thou
art
fastened
to
the
vine
and
thou
wilt
not
be
lost
then
i
was
consoled
for
all
my
sufferings
it
was
likewise
explained
to
me
why
in
my
visions
relating
to
the
feasts
of
the
family
of
jesus
such
for
instance
as
those
of
anne
joachim
joseph
i
always
saw
the
church
of
the
festival
under
the
figure
of
a
shoot
of
the
vine
the
same
was
the
case
on
the
festivals
of
francis
of
assisi
catherine
of
sienna
and
of
all
the
saints
who
have
had
the
stigmas
signification
of
my
sufferings
in
all
my
limbs
was
explained
to
me
in
the
following
vision
i
saw
a
gigantic
human
body
in
a
horrible
state
of
mutilation
and
raised
upwards
towards
the
sky
there
were
no
fingers
or
toes
on
the
hands
and
feet
the
body
was
covered
with
frightful
wounds
some
of
which
were
fresh
and
bleeding
others
covered
with
dead
flesh
or
turned
into
excrescences
the
whole
of
one
side
was
black
gangrened
and
as
it
were
half
eaten
away
i
suffered
as
though
it
had
been
my
own
body
that
was
in
this
state
and
then
my
guide
said
to
me
this
is
the
body
of
the
church
the
body
of
all
men
and
thine
also
then
pointing
to
each
wound
he
showed
me
at
the
same
time
some
part
of
the
world
i
saw
an
infinite
number
of
men
and
nations
separated
from
the
church
all
in
their
own
peculiar
way
and
i
felt
pain
as
exquisite
from
this
separation
as
if
they
had
been
torn
from
my
body
then
my
guide
said
to
me
let
thy
sufferings
teach
thee
a
lesson
and
offer
them
to
god
in
union
with
those
of
jesus
for
all
who
are
separated
should
not
one
member
call
upon
another
and
suffer
in
order
to
cure
and
unite
it
once
more
to
the
body
when
those
parts
which
are
most
closely
united
to
the
body
detach
themselves
it
is
as
though
the
flesh
were
torn
from
around
the
heart
in
my
ignorance
i
thought
that
he
was
speaking
of
those
brethren
who
are
not
in
communion
with
us
but
my
guide
added
who
are
our
brethren
it
is
not
our
blood
relations
who
are
the
nearest
to
our
hearts
but
those
who
are
our
brethren
in
the
blood
of
christ
the
children
of
the
church
who
fall
away
he
showed
me
that
the
black
and
gangrened
side
of
the
body
would
soon
be
cured
that
the
putrefied
flesh
which
had
collected
around
the
wounds
represented
heretics
who
divide
one
from
the
other
in
proportion
as
they
increase
that
the
dead
flesh
was
the
figure
of
all
who
are
spiritually
dead
and
who
are
void
of
any
feeling
and
that
the
ossified
parts
represented
obstinate
and
hardened
heretics
i
saw
and
felt
in
this
manner
every
wound
and
its
signification
the
body
reached
up
to
heaven
it
was
the
body
of
the
bride
of
christ
and
most
painful
to
behold
i
wept
bitterly
but
feeling
at
once
deeply
grieved
and
strengthened
by
sorrow
and
compassion
i
began
again
to
labour
with
all
my
strength
sinking
beneath
the
weight
of
life
and
of
the
task
imposed
upon
her
she
often
besought
god
to
deliver
her
and
she
then
would
appear
to
be
on
the
very
brink
of
the
grave
but
each
time
she
would
say
not
my
will
but
thine
be
done
if
my
prayers
and
sufferings
are
useful
let
me
live
a
thousand
years
but
grant
that
i
may
die
rather
than
ever
offend
thee
then
she
would
receive
orders
to
live
and
arise
taking
up
her
cross
once
more
to
bear
it
in
patience
and
suffering
after
her
lord
from
time
to
time
the
road
of
life
which
she
was
pursuing
used
to
be
shown
to
her
leading
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
on
which
was
a
shining
and
resplendent
city
the
heavenly
jerusalem
often
she
would
think
she
had
arrived
at
that
blissful
abode
which
seemed
to
be
quite
near
her
and
her
joy
would
be
great
but
all
on
a
sudden
she
would
discover
that
she
was
still
separated
from
it
by
a
valley
and
then
she
would
have
to
descend
precipices
and
follow
indirect
paths
labouring
suffering
and
performing
deeds
of
charity
everywhere
she
had
to
direct
wanderers
into
the
right
road
raise
up
the
fallen
sometimes
even
carry
the
paralytic
and
drag
the
unwilling
by
force
and
all
these
deeds
of
charity
were
as
so
many
fresh
weights
fastened
to
her
cross
then
she
walked
with
more
difficulty
bending
beneath
her
burden
and
sometimes
even
falling
to
the
ground
in
she
repeated
more
frequently
than
usual
that
she
could
not
perform
her
task
in
her
present
situation
that
she
had
not
strength
for
it
and
that
it
was
in
a
peaceful
convent
that
she
needed
to
have
lived
and
died
she
added
that
god
would
soon
take
her
to
himself
and
that
she
had
besought
him
to
permit
her
to
obtain
by
her
prayers
in
the
next
world
what
her
weakness
would
not
permit
her
to
accomplish
in
this
catherine
of
sienna
a
short
time
before
death
made
a
similar
prayer
anne
catherine
had
previously
had
a
vision
concerning
what
her
prayers
might
obtain
after
death
with
regard
to
things
that
were
not
in
existence
during
her
life
the
year
the
last
of
which
she
completed
the
whole
circle
brought
her
immense
labours
she
appeared
desirous
to
accomplish
her
entire
task
and
thus
kept
the
promise
which
she
had
previously
made
of
relating
the
history
of
the
whole
passion
it
formed
the
subject
of
her
lenten
meditations
during
this
year
and
of
them
the
present
volume
is
composed
but
she
did
not
on
this
account
take
less
part
in
the
fundamental
mystery
of
this
penitential
season
or
in
the
different
mysteries
of
each
of
the
festival
days
of
the
church
if
indeed
the
words
to
take
part
be
sufficient
to
express
the
wonderful
manner
in
which
she
rendered
visible
testimony
to
the
mystery
celebrated
in
each
festival
by
a
sudden
change
in
her
corporal
and
spiritual
life
see
on
this
subject
the
chapter
entitled
interruption
of
the
pictures
of
the
passion
everyone
of
the
ceremonies
and
festivals
of
the
church
was
to
her
far
more
than
the
consecration
of
a
remembrance
she
beheld
in
the
historical
foundation
of
each
solemnity
an
act
of
the
almighty
done
in
time
for
the
reparation
of
fallen
humanity
although
these
divine
acts
appeared
to
her
stamped
with
the
character
of
eternity
yet
she
was
well
aware
that
in
order
for
man
to
profit
by
them
in
the
bounded
and
narrow
sphere
of
time
he
must
as
it
were
take
possession
of
them
in
a
series
of
successive
moments
and
that
for
this
purpose
they
had
to
be
repeated
and
renewed
in
the
church
in
the
order
established
by
jesus
christ
and
the
holy
spirit
all
festivals
and
solemnities
were
in
her
eyes
eternal
graces
which
returned
at
fixed
epochs
in
every
ecclesiastical
year
in
the
same
manner
as
the
fruits
and
harvests
of
the
earth
come
in
their
seasons
in
the
natural
year
her
zeal
and
gratitude
in
receiving
and
treasuring
up
these
graces
were
untiring
nor
was
she
less
eager
and
zealous
in
offering
them
to
those
who
neglected
their
value
in
the
same
manner
as
her
compassion
for
her
crucified
saviour
had
pleased
god
and
obtained
for
her
the
privilege
of
being
marked
with
the
stigmas
of
the
passion
as
with
a
seal
of
the
most
perfect
love
so
all
the
sufferings
of
the
church
and
of
those
who
were
in
affliction
were
repeated
in
the
different
states
of
her
body
and
soul
and
all
these
wonders
took
place
within
her
unknown
to
those
who
were
around
her
nor
was
she
herself
even
more
fully
conscious
of
them
than
is
the
bee
of
the
effects
of
its
work
while
yet
she
was
tending
and
cultivating
with
all
the
care
of
an
industrious
and
faithful
gardener
the
fertile
garden
of
the
ecclesiastical
year
she
lived
on
its
fruits
and
distributed
them
to
others
she
strengthened
herself
and
her
friends
with
the
flowers
and
herbs
which
she
cultivated
or
rather
she
herself
was
in
this
garden
like
a
sensitive
plant
a
sunflower
or
some
wonderful
plant
in
which
independent
of
her
own
will
were
reproduced
all
the
seasons
of
the
year
all
the
hours
of
the
day
and
all
the
changes
of
the
atmosphere
at
the
end
of
the
ecclesiastical
year
of
she
had
for
the
last
time
a
vision
on
the
subject
of
making
up
the
accounts
of
that
year
the
negligences
of
the
church
militant
and
of
her
servants
were
shown
to
anne
catherine
under
various
symbols
she
saw
how
many
graces
had
not
been
cooperated
with
or
been
rejected
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
and
how
many
had
been
entirely
thrown
away
it
was
made
known
to
her
how
our
blessed
redeemer
had
deposited
for
each
year
in
the
garden
of
the
church
a
complete
treasure
of
his
merits
sufficient
for
every
requirement
and
for
the
expiation
of
every
sin
the
strictest
account
was
to
be
given
of
all
graces
which
had
been
neglected
wasted
or
wholly
rejected
and
the
church
militant
was
punished
for
this
negligence
of
infidelity
of
her
servants
by
being
oppressed
by
her
enemies
or
by
temporal
humiliations
revelations
of
this
description
raised
to
excess
her
love
for
the
church
her
mother
she
passed
days
and
nights
in
praying
for
her
in
offering
to
god
the
merits
of
christ
with
continual
groans
and
in
imploring
mercy
finally
on
these
occasions
she
gathered
together
all
her
courage
and
offered
to
take
upon
herself
both
the
fault
and
the
punishment
like
a
child
presenting
itself
before
the
king
throne
in
order
to
suffer
the
punishment
she
had
incurred
it
was
then
said
to
her
how
wretched
and
miserable
thou
art
thyself
thou
who
art
desirous
to
satisfy
for
the
sins
of
others
and
to
her
great
terror
she
beheld
herself
as
one
mournful
mass
of
infinite
imperfection
but
still
her
love
remained
undaunted
and
burst
forth
in
these
words
i
am
full
of
misery
and
sin
but
i
am
thy
spouse
o
my
lord
and
my
saviour
my
faith
in
thee
and
in
the
redemption
which
thou
hast
brought
us
covers
all
my
sins
as
with
thy
royal
mantle
i
will
not
leave
thee
until
thou
hast
accepted
my
sacrifice
for
the
superabundant
treasure
of
thy
merits
is
closed
to
none
of
thy
faithful
servants
at
length
her
prayer
became
wonderfully
energetic
and
to
human
ears
there
was
like
a
dispute
and
combat
with
god
in
which
she
was
carried
away
and
urged
on
by
the
violence
of
love
if
her
sacrifice
was
accepted
her
energy
seemed
to
abandon
her
and
she
was
left
to
the
repugnance
of
human
nature
for
suffering
when
she
had
gone
through
this
trial
by
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
redeemer
in
the
garden
of
olives
she
next
had
to
endure
indescribable
sufferings
of
every
description
bearing
them
all
with
wonderful
patience
and
sweetness
we
used
to
see
her
remain
several
days
together
motionless
and
insensible
looking
like
a
dying
lamb
did
we
ask
her
how
she
was
she
would
half
open
her
eyes
and
reply
with
a
sweet
smile
sufferings
are
most
salutary
at
the
beginning
of
advent
her
sufferings
were
a
little
soothed
by
sweet
visions
of
the
preparations
made
by
the
blessed
virgin
to
leave
her
home
and
then
of
her
whole
journey
with
joseph
to
bethlehem
she
accompanied
them
each
day
to
the
humble
inns
where
they
rested
for
the
night
or
went
on
before
them
to
prepare
their
lodgings
during
this
time
she
used
to
take
old
pieces
of
linen
and
at
night
while
sleeping
make
them
into
baby
clothes
and
caps
for
the
children
of
poor
women
the
times
of
whose
confinements
were
near
at
hand
the
next
day
she
would
be
surprised
to
see
all
these
things
neatly
arranged
in
her
drawers
this
happened
to
her
every
year
about
the
same
time
but
this
year
she
had
more
fatigue
and
less
consolation
thus
at
the
hour
of
our
saviour
birth
when
she
was
usually
perfectly
overwhelmed
with
joy
she
could
only
crawl
with
the
greatest
difficulty
to
the
crib
where
the
child
jesus
was
lying
and
bring
him
no
present
but
myrrh
no
offering
but
her
cross
beneath
the
weight
of
which
she
sank
down
half
dying
at
his
feet
it
seemed
as
though
she
were
for
the
last
time
making
up
her
earthly
accounts
with
god
and
for
the
last
time
also
offering
herself
in
the
place
of
a
countless
number
of
men
who
were
spiritually
and
corporally
afflicted
even
the
little
that
is
known
of
the
manner
in
which
she
took
upon
herself
the
sufferings
of
others
is
almost
incomprehensible
she
very
truly
said
year
the
child
jesus
has
only
brought
me
a
cross
and
instruments
of
suffering
she
became
each
day
more
and
more
absorbed
in
her
sufferings
and
although
she
continued
to
see
jesus
travelling
from
city
to
city
during
his
public
life
the
utmost
she
ever
said
on
the
subject
was
briefly
to
name
in
which
direction
he
was
going
once
she
asked
suddenly
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
day
is
it
when
told
that
it
was
the
of
january
she
added
i
but
a
few
days
more
i
should
have
related
the
entire
life
of
our
saviour
but
now
it
is
no
longer
possible
for
me
to
do
so
these
words
were
the
more
incomprehensible
as
she
did
not
appear
to
know
even
which
year
of
the
public
life
of
jesus
she
was
then
contemplating
in
spirit
in
she
had
related
the
history
of
our
saviour
down
to
the
ascension
beginning
at
the
of
july
of
the
third
year
of
the
public
life
of
jesus
and
had
continued
down
to
the
of
january
of
the
third
year
of
his
public
life
on
the
of
april
in
consequence
of
a
journey
made
by
the
writer
an
interruption
of
her
narrative
took
place
and
lasted
down
to
the
of
october
she
then
took
up
the
tread
of
her
narrative
where
she
had
left
it
and
continued
it
to
the
last
weeks
of
her
life
when
she
spoke
of
a
few
days
being
wanted
her
friend
himself
did
not
know
how
far
her
narrative
went
not
having
had
leisure
to
arrange
what
he
had
written
after
her
death
he
became
convinced
that
if
she
had
been
able
to
speak
during
the
last
fourteen
days
of
her
life
she
would
have
brought
it
down
to
the
of
july
of
the
third
year
of
the
public
life
of
our
lord
consequently
to
where
she
had
taken
it
up
in
her
condition
daily
became
more
frightful
she
who
usually
suffered
in
silence
uttered
stifled
groans
so
awful
was
the
anguish
she
endured
on
the
of
january
she
said
child
jesus
brought
me
great
sufferings
at
christmas
i
was
once
more
by
his
manger
at
bethlehem
he
was
burning
with
fever
and
showed
me
his
sufferings
and
those
of
his
mother
they
were
so
poor
that
they
had
no
food
but
a
wretched
piece
of
bread
he
bestowed
still
greatest
sufferings
upon
me
and
said
to
me
thou
art
mine
thou
art
my
spouse
suffer
as
i
suffered
without
asking
the
reason
why
i
do
not
know
what
my
sufferings
are
to
be
nor
how
long
they
will
last
i
submit
blindly
to
my
martyrdom
whether
for
life
or
for
death
i
only
desire
that
the
hidden
designs
of
god
may
be
accomplished
in
me
on
the
other
hand
i
am
calm
and
i
have
consolations
in
my
sufferings
even
this
morning
i
was
very
happy
blessed
be
the
name
of
god
her
sufferings
continued
if
possible
to
increase
sitting
up
and
with
her
eyes
closed
she
fell
from
one
side
to
another
while
smothered
groans
escaped
her
lips
if
she
laid
down
she
was
in
danger
of
being
stifled
her
breathing
was
hurried
and
oppressed
and
all
her
nerves
and
muscles
were
shaken
and
trembled
with
anguish
after
violent
retching
she
suffered
terrible
pain
in
her
bowels
so
much
so
that
it
was
feared
gangrene
must
be
forming
there
her
throat
was
parched
and
burning
her
mouth
swollen
her
cheeks
crimson
with
fever
her
hands
white
as
ivory
the
scars
of
the
stigmas
shone
like
silver
beneath
her
distended
skin
her
pulse
gave
from
to
pulsations
per
minute
although
unable
to
speak
from
her
excessive
suffering
she
bore
every
duty
perfectly
in
mind
on
the
evening
of
the
she
said
to
her
friend
is
the
ninth
day
you
must
pay
for
the
wax
taper
and
novena
at
the
chapel
of
st
anne
she
was
alluding
to
a
novena
which
she
had
asked
to
have
made
for
her
intention
and
she
was
afraid
lest
her
friends
should
forget
it
on
the
at
two
in
the
afternoon
she
received
extreme
unction
greatly
to
the
relief
both
of
her
soul
and
body
in
the
evening
her
friend
the
excellent
cure
of
prayed
at
her
bedside
which
was
an
immense
comfort
to
her
she
said
to
him
good
and
beautiful
all
this
is
and
again
god
be
a
thousand
times
praised
and
thanked
the
approach
of
death
did
not
wholly
interrupt
the
wonderful
union
of
her
life
with
that
of
the
church
a
friend
having
visited
her
on
the
of
february
in
the
evening
had
placed
himself
behind
her
bed
where
she
could
not
see
him
and
was
listening
with
the
utmost
compassion
to
her
low
moans
and
interrupted
breathing
when
suddenly
all
became
silent
and
he
thought
that
she
was
dead
at
this
moment
the
evening
bell
ringing
for
the
matins
of
the
purification
was
heard
it
was
the
opening
of
this
festival
which
had
caused
her
soul
to
be
ravished
in
ecstasy
although
still
in
a
very
alarming
state
she
let
some
sweet
and
loving
words
concerning
the
blessed
virgin
escape
her
lips
during
the
night
and
day
of
the
festival
towards
twelve
in
the
day
she
said
in
a
voice
already
changed
by
the
near
approach
of
death
was
long
since
i
had
felt
so
well
i
have
been
ill
quite
a
week
have
i
not
i
feel
as
though
i
knew
nothing
about
this
world
of
darkness
o
what
light
the
blessed
mother
of
god
showed
me
she
took
me
with
her
and
how
willingly
would
i
have
remained
with
her
here
she
recollected
herself
for
a
moment
and
then
said
placing
her
finger
on
her
lip
i
must
not
speak
of
these
things
from
that
time
she
said
that
the
slightest
word
in
her
praise
greatly
increased
her
sufferings
the
following
days
she
was
worse
on
the
in
the
evening
being
rather
more
calm
she
said
my
sweet
lord
jesus
thanks
be
to
thee
again
and
again
for
every
part
of
my
life
lord
thy
will
and
not
mine
be
done
on
the
of
february
in
the
evening
a
priest
was
praying
near
her
bed
when
she
gratefully
kissed
his
hand
begged
him
to
assist
at
her
death
and
said
jesus
i
live
for
thee
i
die
for
thee
o
lord
praise
be
to
thy
holy
name
i
no
longer
see
or
hear
her
friends
wished
to
change
her
position
and
thus
ease
her
pain
a
little
but
she
said
am
on
the
cross
it
will
soon
all
be
over
leave
me
in
peace
she
had
received
all
the
last
sacraments
but
she
wished
to
accuse
herself
once
more
in
confession
of
a
slight
fault
which
she
had
already
many
times
confessed
it
was
probably
of
the
same
nature
as
a
sin
which
she
had
committed
in
her
childhood
of
which
she
often
accused
herself
and
which
consisted
in
having
gone
through
a
hedge
into
a
neighbour
garden
and
coveted
some
apples
which
had
fallen
on
the
ground
she
had
only
looked
at
them
for
thank
god
she
said
she
did
not
touch
them
but
she
thought
that
was
a
sin
against
the
tenth
commandment
the
priest
gave
her
a
general
absolution
after
which
she
stretched
herself
out
and
those
around
her
thought
that
she
was
dying
a
person
who
had
often
given
her
pain
now
drew
near
her
bed
and
asked
her
pardon
she
looked
at
him
in
surprise
and
said
with
the
most
expressive
accent
of
truth
have
nothing
to
forgive
any
living
creature
during
the
last
days
of
her
life
when
her
death
was
momentarily
expected
several
of
her
friends
remained
constantly
in
the
room
adjoining
hers
they
were
speaking
in
a
low
tone
and
so
that
she
could
not
hear
them
of
her
patience
faith
and
other
virtues
when
all
on
a
sudden
they
heard
her
dying
voice
saying
for
the
love
of
god
do
not
praise
me
that
keeps
me
here
because
i
then
have
to
suffer
double
o
my
god
how
many
fresh
flowers
are
falling
upon
me
she
always
saw
flowers
as
the
forerunners
and
figures
of
sufferings
then
she
rejected
all
praises
with
the
most
profound
conviction
of
her
own
unworthiness
saying
alone
is
good
everything
must
be
paid
down
to
the
last
farthing
i
am
poor
and
loaded
with
sin
and
i
can
only
make
up
for
having
been
praised
by
sufferings
united
to
those
of
jesus
christ
do
not
praise
me
but
let
me
die
in
ignominy
with
jesus
on
the
cross
boudon
in
his
life
of
father
surin
relates
a
similar
trait
of
a
dying
man
who
had
been
thought
to
have
lost
the
sense
of
hearing
but
who
energetically
rejected
a
word
of
praise
pronounced
by
those
who
were
surrounding
his
bed
a
few
hours
before
death
for
which
she
was
longing
saying
lord
assist
me
come
o
lord
jesus
a
word
of
praise
appeared
to
detain
her
and
she
most
energetically
rejected
it
by
making
the
following
act
of
humility
can
not
die
if
so
many
good
persons
think
well
of
me
through
a
mistake
i
beg
of
you
to
tell
them
all
that
i
am
a
wretched
sinner
would
that
i
could
proclaim
so
as
to
be
heard
by
all
men
how
great
a
sinner
i
am
i
am
far
beneath
the
good
thief
who
was
crucified
by
the
side
of
jesus
for
he
and
all
his
contemporaries
had
not
so
terrible
an
account
as
we
shall
have
to
render
of
all
the
graces
which
have
been
bestowed
upon
the
church
after
this
declaration
she
appeared
to
grow
calm
and
she
said
to
the
priest
who
was
comforting
her
feel
now
as
peaceful
and
as
much
filled
with
hope
and
confidence
as
if
i
had
never
committed
a
sin
her
eyes
turned
lovingly
towards
the
cross
which
was
placed
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
her
breathing
became
accelerated
she
often
drank
some
liquid
and
when
the
little
crucifix
was
held
to
her
she
from
humility
only
kissed
the
feet
a
friend
who
was
kneeling
by
her
bedside
in
tears
had
the
comfort
of
often
holding
her
the
water
with
which
to
moisten
her
lips
as
he
had
laid
her
hand
on
which
the
white
scar
of
the
wound
was
most
distinctly
visible
on
the
counterpane
he
took
hold
of
that
hand
which
was
already
cold
and
as
he
inwardly
wished
for
some
mark
of
farewell
from
her
she
slightly
pressed
his
her
face
was
calm
and
serene
bearing
an
expression
of
heavenly
gravity
and
which
can
only
be
compared
to
that
of
a
valiant
wrestler
who
after
making
unheard
of
efforts
to
gain
the
victory
sinks
back
and
dies
in
the
very
act
of
seizing
the
prize
the
priest
again
read
through
the
prayers
for
persons
in
their
last
agony
and
she
then
felt
an
inward
inspiration
to
pray
for
a
pious
young
friend
whose
feast
day
it
was
eight
struck
she
breathed
more
freely
for
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
and
then
cried
three
times
with
a
deep
groan
lord
assist
me
lord
lord
come
the
priest
rang
his
bell
and
said
is
dying
several
relations
and
friends
who
were
in
the
next
room
came
in
and
knelt
down
to
pray
she
was
then
holding
in
her
hand
a
lighted
taper
which
the
priest
was
supporting
she
breathed
forth
several
slight
sighs
and
then
her
pure
soul
escaped
her
chaste
lips
and
hastened
clothed
in
the
nuptial
garment
to
appear
in
heavenly
hope
before
the
divine
bridegroom
and
be
united
for
ever
to
that
blessed
company
of
virgins
who
follow
the
lamb
whithersoever
he
goeth
her
lifeless
body
sank
gently
back
on
the
pillows
at
halfpast
eight
on
the
february
a
person
who
had
taken
great
interest
in
her
during
life
wrote
as
follows
her
death
i
drew
near
to
her
bed
she
was
supported
by
pillows
and
lying
on
her
left
side
some
crutches
which
had
been
prepared
for
her
by
her
friends
on
one
occasion
when
she
had
been
able
to
take
a
few
turns
in
the
room
were
hanging
over
her
head
crossed
in
a
corner
near
them
hung
a
little
oil
painting
representing
the
death
of
the
blessed
virgin
which
had
been
given
her
by
the
princess
of
salm
the
expression
of
her
countenance
was
perfectly
sublime
and
bore
the
traces
of
the
spirit
of
the
patience
and
resignation
of
her
whole
life
she
looked
as
though
she
had
died
for
the
love
of
jesus
in
the
very
act
of
performing
some
work
of
charity
for
others
her
right
hand
was
resting
on
the
counterpane
that
hand
on
which
god
had
bestowed
the
unparalleled
favour
of
being
able
at
once
to
recognise
by
the
touch
anything
that
was
holy
or
that
had
been
consecrated
by
the
church
a
favour
which
perhaps
no
one
had
ever
before
enjoyed
to
so
great
an
extent
a
favour
by
which
the
interests
of
religion
might
be
inconceivably
promoted
provided
it
was
made
use
of
with
discretion
and
which
surely
had
not
been
bestowed
upon
a
poor
ignorant
peasant
girl
merely
for
her
own
personal
gratification
for
the
last
time
i
took
in
mine
the
hand
marked
with
a
sign
so
worthy
of
our
utmost
veneration
the
hand
which
was
as
a
spiritual
instrument
in
the
instant
recognition
of
whatever
was
holy
that
it
might
be
honoured
even
in
a
grain
of
sand
the
charitable
industrious
hand
which
had
so
often
fed
the
hungry
and
clothed
the
naked
this
hand
was
now
cold
and
lifeless
a
great
favour
had
been
withdrawn
from
earth
god
had
taken
from
us
the
hand
of
his
spouse
who
had
rendered
testimony
to
prayed
and
suffered
for
the
truth
it
appeared
as
though
it
had
not
been
without
meaning
that
she
had
resignedly
laid
down
upon
her
bed
the
hand
which
was
the
outward
expression
of
a
particular
privilege
granted
by
divine
grace
fearful
of
having
the
strong
impression
made
upon
me
by
the
sight
of
her
countenance
diminished
by
the
necessary
but
disturbing
preparations
which
were
being
made
around
her
bed
i
thoughtfully
left
her
room
if
i
said
to
myself
if
like
so
many
holy
solitaries
she
had
died
alone
in
a
grave
prepared
by
her
own
hands
her
friends
the
birds
would
have
covered
her
with
flowers
and
leaves
if
like
other
religious
she
had
died
among
virgins
consecrated
to
god
and
that
their
tender
care
and
respectful
veneration
had
followed
her
to
the
grave
as
was
the
case
for
example
with
colomba
of
rieti
it
would
have
been
edifying
and
pleasing
to
those
who
loved
her
but
doubtless
such
honours
rendered
to
her
lifeless
remains
would
not
have
been
conformable
to
her
love
for
jesus
whom
she
so
much
desired
to
resemble
in
death
as
in
life
the
same
friend
later
wrote
as
follows
there
was
no
official
examination
of
her
body
and
none
of
those
inquiries
by
which
she
had
been
so
tormented
during
life
were
instituted
after
her
death
the
friends
who
surrounded
her
neglected
to
examine
her
body
probably
for
fear
of
coming
upon
some
striking
phenomenon
the
discovery
of
which
might
have
caused
much
annoyance
in
various
ways
on
wednesday
the
of
february
her
body
was
prepared
for
burial
a
pious
female
who
would
not
give
up
to
anyone
the
task
of
rendering
her
this
last
mark
of
affection
described
to
me
as
follows
the
condition
in
which
she
found
her
her
feet
were
crossed
like
the
feet
of
a
crucifix
the
places
of
the
stigmas
were
more
red
than
usual
when
we
raised
her
head
blood
flowed
from
her
nose
and
mouth
all
her
limbs
remained
flexible
and
with
none
of
the
stiffness
of
death
even
till
the
coffin
was
closed
on
friday
the
of
february
she
was
taken
to
the
grave
followed
by
the
entire
population
of
the
place
she
reposes
in
the
cemetery
to
the
left
of
the
cross
on
the
side
nearest
the
hedge
in
the
grave
in
front
of
hers
there
rests
a
good
old
peasant
of
welde
and
in
the
grave
behind
a
poor
but
virtuous
female
from
dernekamp
on
the
evening
of
the
day
when
she
was
buried
a
rich
man
went
not
to
pilate
but
to
the
cure
of
the
place
he
asked
for
the
body
of
anne
catherine
not
to
place
it
in
a
new
sepulchre
but
to
buy
it
at
a
high
price
for
a
dutch
doctor
the
proposal
was
rejected
as
it
deserved
but
it
appears
that
the
report
was
spread
in
the
little
town
that
the
body
had
been
taken
away
and
it
is
said
that
the
people
went
in
great
numbers
to
the
cemetery
to
ascertain
whether
the
grave
had
been
robbed
to
these
details
we
will
add
the
following
extract
from
an
account
printed
in
december
in
the
journal
of
catholic
literature
of
kerz
this
account
was
written
by
a
person
with
whom
we
are
unacquainted
but
who
appears
to
have
been
well
informed
six
or
seven
weeks
after
the
death
of
anne
catherine
emmerich
a
report
having
got
about
that
her
body
had
been
stolen
away
the
grave
and
coffin
were
opened
in
secret
by
order
of
the
authorities
in
the
presence
of
seven
witnesses
they
found
with
surprise
not
unmixed
with
joy
that
corruption
had
not
yet
begun
its
work
on
the
body
of
the
pious
maiden
her
features
and
countenance
were
smiling
like
those
of
a
person
who
is
dreaming
sweetly
she
looked
as
though
she
had
but
just
been
placed
in
the
coffin
nor
did
her
body
exhale
any
smell
it
is
good
to
keep
the
secret
of
the
king
says
jesus
the
son
of
sirach
but
it
is
also
good
to
reveal
to
the
world
the
greatness
of
the
mercy
of
god
we
have
been
told
that
a
stone
has
been
placed
over
her
grave
we
lay
upon
it
these
pages
may
they
contribute
to
immortalise
the
memory
of
a
person
who
has
relieved
so
many
pains
of
soul
and
body
and
that
of
the
spot
where
her
mortal
remains
lie
awaiting
the
day
of
resurrection
to
the
reader
whoever
compares
the
following
meditations
with
the
short
history
of
the
last
supper
given
in
the
gospel
will
discover
some
slight
differences
between
them
an
explanation
should
be
given
of
this
although
it
can
never
be
sufficiently
impressed
upon
the
reader
that
these
writings
have
no
pretensions
whatever
to
add
an
iota
to
sacred
scripture
as
interpreted
by
the
church
sister
emmerich
saw
the
events
of
the
last
supper
take
place
in
the
following
order
the
paschal
lamb
was
immolated
and
prepared
in
the
our
lord
held
a
discourse
on
that
occasion
the
guests
were
dressed
as
travellers
and
ate
standing
the
lamb
and
other
food
prescribed
by
the
law
the
cup
of
wine
was
twice
presented
to
our
lord
but
he
did
not
drink
of
it
the
second
time
distributing
it
to
his
apostles
with
these
words
i
shall
drink
no
more
of
the
fruit
of
the
vine
etc
then
they
sat
down
jesus
spoke
of
the
traitor
peter
feared
lest
it
should
be
himself
judas
received
from
our
lord
the
piece
of
bread
dipped
which
was
the
sign
that
it
was
he
preparations
were
made
for
the
washing
of
the
feet
peter
strove
against
his
feet
being
washed
then
came
the
institution
of
the
holy
eucharist
judas
communicated
and
afterwards
left
the
apartment
the
oils
were
consecrated
and
instructions
given
concerning
them
peter
and
the
other
apostles
received
ordination
our
lord
made
his
final
discourse
peter
protested
that
he
would
never
abandon
him
and
then
the
supper
concluded
by
adopting
this
order
it
appears
at
first
as
though
it
were
in
contradiction
to
the
passages
of
matthew
and
of
mark
in
which
the
words
i
will
drink
no
more
of
the
fruit
of
the
vine
come
after
the
consecration
but
in
luke
they
come
before
on
the
contrary
all
that
concerns
the
traitor
judas
comes
here
as
in
matthew
and
mark
before
the
consecration
whereas
in
luke
it
does
not
come
till
afterwards
john
who
does
not
relate
the
history
of
the
institution
of
the
holy
eucharist
gives
us
to
understand
that
judas
went
out
immediately
after
jesus
had
given
him
the
bread
but
it
appears
most
probable
from
the
accounts
of
the
other
evangelists
that
judas
received
the
holy
communion
under
both
forms
and
several
of
the
fathers
augustine
gregory
the
great
and
leo
the
great
as
well
as
the
tradition
of
the
catholic
church
tell
us
expressly
that
such
was
the
case
besides
were
the
order
in
which
john
presents
events
taken
literally
he
would
contradict
not
only
matthew
and
mark
but
himself
for
it
must
follow
from
verse
chap
that
judas
also
had
his
feet
washed
now
the
washing
of
the
feet
took
place
after
the
eating
of
the
paschal
lamb
and
it
was
necessarily
whilst
it
was
being
eaten
that
jesus
presented
the
bread
to
the
traitor
it
is
plain
that
the
evangelists
here
as
in
several
other
parts
of
their
writings
gave
their
attention
to
the
sacred
narrative
as
a
whole
and
did
not
consider
themselves
bound
to
relate
every
detail
in
precisely
the
same
order
which
fully
explains
the
apparent
contradictions
of
each
other
which
are
to
be
found
in
their
gospels
the
following
pages
will
appear
to
the
attentive
reader
rather
a
simple
and
natural
concordance
of
the
gospels
than
a
history
differing
in
any
point
of
the
slightest
importance
from
that
of
scripture
meditation
preparations
for
the
pasch
holy
thursday
the
nisan
of
march
yesterday
evening
it
was
that
the
last
great
public
repast
of
our
lord
and
his
friends
took
place
in
the
house
of
simon
the
leper
at
bethania
and
mary
magdalen
for
the
last
time
anointed
the
feet
of
jesus
with
precious
ointment
judas
was
scandalised
upon
this
occasion
and
hastened
forthwith
to
jerusalem
again
to
conspire
with
the
for
the
betrayal
of
jesus
into
their
hands
after
the
repast
jesus
returned
to
the
house
of
lazarus
and
some
of
the
apostles
went
to
the
inn
situated
beyond
bethania
during
the
night
nicodemus
again
came
to
lazarus
house
had
a
long
conversation
with
our
lord
and
returned
before
daylight
to
jerusalem
being
accompanied
part
of
the
way
by
lazarus
the
disciples
had
already
asked
jesus
where
he
would
eat
the
pasch
before
dawn
our
lord
sent
for
peter
james
and
john
spoke
to
them
at
some
length
concerning
all
they
had
to
prepare
and
order
at
jerusalem
and
told
them
that
when
ascending
mount
sion
they
would
meet
the
man
carrying
a
pitcher
of
water
they
were
already
well
acquainted
with
this
man
for
at
the
last
pasch
at
bethania
it
had
been
he
who
prepared
the
meal
for
jesus
and
this
is
why
matthew
says
a
certain
man
they
were
to
follow
him
home
and
say
to
him
the
master
saith
my
time
is
near
at
hand
with
thee
i
make
the
pasch
with
my
disciples
matt
they
were
than
to
be
shown
the
and
make
all
necessary
preparations
i
saw
the
apostles
ascending
towards
jerusalem
along
a
ravine
to
the
south
of
the
temple
and
in
the
direction
of
the
north
side
of
sion
on
the
southern
side
of
the
mountain
on
which
the
temple
stood
there
were
some
rows
of
houses
and
they
walked
opposite
these
houses
following
the
stream
of
an
intervening
torrent
when
they
had
reached
the
summit
of
mount
sion
which
is
higher
than
the
mountain
of
the
temple
they
turned
their
steps
towards
the
south
and
just
at
the
beginning
of
a
small
ascent
met
the
man
who
had
been
named
to
them
they
followed
and
spoke
to
him
as
jesus
had
commanded
he
was
much
gratified
by
their
words
and
answered
that
a
supper
had
already
been
ordered
to
be
prepared
at
his
house
probably
by
nicodemus
but
that
he
had
not
been
aware
for
whom
and
was
delighted
to
learn
that
it
was
for
jesus
this
man
name
was
heli
and
he
was
the
of
zachary
of
hebron
in
whose
house
jesus
had
in
the
preceding
year
announced
the
death
of
john
the
baptist
he
had
only
one
son
who
was
a
levite
and
a
friend
of
luke
before
the
latter
was
called
by
our
lord
and
five
daughters
all
of
whom
were
unmarried
he
went
up
every
year
with
his
servants
for
the
festival
of
the
pasch
hired
a
room
and
prepared
the
pasch
for
persons
who
had
no
friend
in
the
town
to
lodge
with
this
year
he
had
hired
a
which
belonged
to
nicodemus
and
joseph
of
arimathea
he
showed
the
two
apostles
its
position
and
interior
arrangement
meditation
ii
the
on
the
southern
side
of
mount
sion
not
far
from
the
ruined
castle
of
david
and
the
market
held
on
the
ascent
leading
to
that
castle
there
stood
towards
the
east
an
ancient
and
solid
building
between
rows
of
thick
trees
in
the
midst
of
a
spacious
court
surrounded
by
strong
walls
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
entrance
other
buildings
were
to
be
seen
adjoining
the
wall
particularly
to
the
right
where
stood
the
dwelling
of
the
and
close
to
it
the
house
in
which
the
blessed
virgin
and
the
holy
women
spent
most
of
their
time
after
the
death
of
jesus
the
which
was
originally
larger
had
formerly
been
inhabited
by
david
brave
captains
who
had
there
learned
the
use
of
arms
previous
to
the
building
of
the
temple
the
ark
of
the
covenant
had
been
deposited
there
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
and
traces
of
its
presence
were
still
to
be
found
in
an
underground
room
i
have
also
seen
the
prophet
malachy
hidden
beneath
this
same
roof
he
there
wrote
his
prophecies
concerning
the
blessed
sacrament
and
the
sacrifice
of
the
new
law
solomon
held
this
house
in
honour
and
performed
within
its
walls
some
figurative
and
symbolical
action
which
i
have
forgotten
when
a
great
part
of
jerusalem
was
destroyed
by
the
babylonians
this
house
was
spared
i
have
seen
many
other
things
concerning
this
same
house
but
i
only
remember
what
i
have
now
told
this
building
was
in
a
very
dilapidated
state
when
it
became
the
property
of
nicodemus
and
joseph
of
arimathea
who
arranged
the
principal
building
in
a
very
suitable
manner
and
let
it
as
a
to
strangers
coming
to
jerusalem
for
the
purpose
of
celebrating
the
festival
of
the
pasch
thus
it
was
that
our
lord
had
made
use
of
it
the
previous
year
moreover
the
house
and
surrounding
buildings
served
as
warehouses
for
monuments
and
other
stones
and
as
workshops
for
the
labourers
for
joseph
of
arimathea
possessed
valuable
quarries
in
his
own
country
from
which
he
had
large
blocks
of
stone
brought
that
his
workmen
might
fashion
them
under
his
own
eye
into
tombs
architectural
ornaments
and
columns
for
sale
nicodemus
had
a
share
in
this
business
and
used
to
spend
many
leisure
hours
himself
in
sculpturing
he
worked
in
the
room
or
in
a
subterraneous
apartment
which
saw
beneath
it
excepting
at
the
times
of
the
festivals
and
this
occupation
having
brought
him
into
connection
with
joseph
of
arimathea
they
had
become
friends
and
often
joined
together
in
various
transactions
this
morning
whilst
peter
and
john
were
conversing
with
the
man
who
had
hired
the
i
saw
nicodemus
in
the
buildings
to
the
left
of
the
court
where
a
great
many
stones
which
filled
up
the
passages
leading
to
the
had
been
placed
a
week
before
i
had
seen
several
persons
engaged
in
putting
the
stones
on
one
side
cleaning
the
court
and
preparing
the
for
the
celebration
of
the
pasch
it
even
appears
to
me
that
there
were
among
them
some
disciples
of
our
lord
perhaps
aram
and
themein
the
cousins
of
joseph
of
arimathea
the
properly
so
called
was
nearly
in
the
centre
of
the
court
its
length
was
greater
than
its
width
it
was
surrounded
by
a
row
of
low
pillars
and
if
the
spaces
between
the
pillars
had
been
cleared
would
have
formed
a
part
of
the
large
inner
room
for
the
whole
edifice
was
as
it
were
transparent
only
it
was
usual
except
on
special
occasions
for
the
passages
to
be
closed
up
the
room
was
lighted
by
apertures
at
the
top
of
the
walls
in
front
there
was
first
a
vestibule
into
which
three
doors
gave
entrance
next
the
large
inner
room
where
several
lamps
hung
from
the
platform
the
walls
were
ornamented
for
the
festival
half
way
up
with
beautiful
matting
or
tapestry
and
an
aperture
had
been
made
in
the
roof
and
covered
over
with
transparent
blue
gauze
the
back
part
of
this
room
was
separated
from
the
rest
by
a
curtain
also
of
blue
transparent
gauze
this
division
of
the
into
three
parts
gave
a
resemblance
to
the
temple
thus
forming
the
outer
court
the
holy
and
the
holy
of
holies
in
the
last
of
these
divisions
on
both
sides
the
dresses
and
other
things
necessary
for
the
celebration
of
the
feast
were
placed
in
the
centre
there
was
a
species
of
altar
a
stone
bench
raised
on
three
steps
and
of
a
rectangular
triangular
shape
came
out
of
the
wall
it
must
have
constituted
the
upper
part
of
the
oven
used
for
roasting
the
paschal
lamb
for
the
steps
were
quite
heated
during
the
repast
i
can
not
describe
in
detail
all
that
there
was
in
this
part
of
the
room
but
all
kinds
of
arrangements
were
being
made
there
for
preparing
the
paschal
supper
above
this
hearth
of
altar
there
was
a
species
of
niche
in
the
wall
in
front
of
which
i
saw
an
image
of
the
paschal
lamb
with
a
knife
in
its
throat
and
the
blood
appearing
to
flow
drop
by
drop
upon
the
altar
but
i
do
not
remember
distinctly
how
that
was
done
in
a
niche
in
the
wall
there
were
three
cupboards
of
various
colours
which
turned
like
our
tabernacles
for
opening
or
closing
a
number
of
vessels
used
in
the
celebration
of
the
pasch
were
kept
in
them
later
the
blessed
sacrament
was
placed
there
in
the
rooms
at
the
sides
of
the
there
were
some
couches
on
which
thick
coverlids
rolled
up
were
placed
and
which
could
be
used
as
beds
there
were
spacious
cellars
beneath
the
whole
of
this
building
the
ark
of
the
covenant
was
formerly
deposited
under
the
very
spot
where
the
hearth
was
afterwards
built
five
gutters
under
the
house
served
to
convey
the
refuse
to
the
slope
of
the
hill
on
the
upper
part
of
which
the
house
was
built
i
had
preciously
seen
jesus
preach
and
perform
miraculous
cures
there
and
the
disciples
frequently
passed
the
night
in
the
side
rooms
meditation
iii
arrangements
for
eating
the
paschal
lamb
when
the
disciples
had
spoken
to
heli
of
hebron
the
latter
went
back
into
the
house
by
the
court
but
they
turned
to
the
right
and
hastened
down
the
north
side
of
the
hill
through
sion
they
passed
over
a
bridge
and
walking
along
a
road
covered
with
brambles
reached
the
other
side
of
the
ravine
which
was
in
front
of
the
temple
and
of
the
row
of
houses
which
were
to
the
south
of
that
building
there
stood
the
house
of
the
aged
simeon
who
died
in
the
temple
after
the
presentation
of
our
lord
and
his
sons
some
of
whom
were
disciples
of
jesus
in
secret
were
actually
living
there
the
apostles
spoke
to
one
of
them
a
tall
man
who
held
some
office
in
the
temple
they
went
with
him
to
the
eastern
side
of
the
temple
through
that
part
of
ophel
by
which
jesus
made
his
entry
into
jerusalem
on
and
thence
to
the
which
stood
in
the
town
to
the
north
of
the
temple
in
the
southern
part
of
this
market
i
saw
little
enclosures
in
which
some
beautiful
lambs
were
gambolling
about
here
it
was
that
lambs
for
the
pasch
were
bought
i
saw
the
son
of
simeon
enter
one
of
these
enclosures
and
the
lambs
gambolled
round
him
as
if
they
knew
him
he
chose
out
four
which
were
carried
to
the
engaged
in
preparing
the
paschal
lamb
i
saw
peter
and
john
go
to
several
different
parts
of
the
town
and
order
various
things
i
saw
them
also
standing
opposite
the
door
of
a
house
situated
to
the
north
of
mount
calvary
where
the
disciples
of
jesus
lodged
the
greatest
part
of
the
time
and
which
belonged
to
seraphia
afterwards
called
veronica
peter
and
john
sent
some
disciples
from
thence
to
the
giving
them
several
commissions
which
i
have
forgotten
they
also
went
into
seraphia
house
where
they
had
several
arrangements
to
make
her
husband
who
was
a
member
of
the
council
was
usually
absent
and
engaged
in
business
but
even
when
he
was
at
home
she
saw
little
of
him
she
was
a
woman
of
about
the
age
of
the
blessed
virgin
and
had
long
been
connected
with
the
holy
family
for
when
the
child
jesus
remained
the
three
days
in
jerusalem
after
the
feast
she
it
was
who
supplied
him
with
food
the
two
apostles
took
from
thence
among
other
things
the
chalice
of
which
our
lord
made
use
in
the
institution
of
the
holy
eucharist
meditation
iv
the
chalice
used
at
the
last
supper
the
chalice
which
the
apostles
brought
from
veronica
house
was
wonderful
and
mysterious
in
its
appearance
it
had
been
kept
a
long
time
in
the
temple
among
other
precious
objects
of
great
antiquity
the
use
and
origin
of
which
had
been
forgotten
the
same
has
been
in
some
degree
the
case
in
the
christian
church
where
many
consecrated
jewels
have
been
forgotten
and
fallen
into
disuse
with
time
ancient
vases
and
jewels
buried
beneath
the
temple
had
often
been
dug
up
sold
or
reset
thus
it
was
that
by
god
permission
this
holy
vessel
which
none
had
ever
been
able
to
melt
down
on
account
of
its
being
made
of
some
unknown
material
and
which
had
been
found
by
the
priests
in
the
treasury
of
the
temple
among
other
objects
no
longer
made
use
of
had
been
sold
to
some
antiquaries
it
was
bought
by
seraphia
was
several
times
made
use
of
by
jesus
in
the
celebration
of
festivals
and
from
the
day
of
the
last
supper
became
the
exclusive
property
of
the
holy
christian
community
this
vessel
was
not
always
the
same
as
when
used
by
our
lord
at
his
last
supper
and
perhaps
it
was
upon
that
occasion
that
the
various
pieces
which
composed
it
were
first
put
together
the
great
chalice
stood
upon
a
plate
out
of
which
a
species
of
tablet
could
also
be
drawn
and
around
it
there
were
six
little
glasses
the
great
chalice
contained
another
smaller
vase
above
it
there
was
a
small
plate
and
then
came
a
round
cover
a
spoon
was
inserted
in
the
foot
of
the
chalice
and
could
be
easily
drawn
out
for
use
all
these
different
vessels
were
covered
with
fine
linen
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
were
wrapped
up
in
a
case
made
of
leather
the
great
chalice
was
composed
of
the
cup
and
of
the
foot
which
last
must
have
been
joined
on
to
it
at
a
later
period
for
it
was
of
a
different
material
the
cup
was
massive
and
highly
polished
with
gold
ornaments
and
two
small
handles
by
which
it
could
be
lifted
the
foot
was
of
virgin
gold
elaborately
worked
ornamented
with
a
serpent
and
a
small
bunch
of
grapes
and
enriched
with
precious
stones
the
chalice
was
left
in
the
church
of
jerusalem
in
the
hand
of
james
the
less
and
i
see
that
it
is
still
preserved
in
that
town
it
will
reappear
some
day
in
the
same
manner
as
before
other
churches
took
the
little
cups
which
surrounded
it
one
was
taken
to
antioch
and
another
to
ephesus
they
belonged
to
the
patriarchs
who
drank
some
mysterious
beverage
out
of
them
when
they
received
or
gave
a
benediction
as
i
have
seen
many
times
the
great
chalice
had
formerly
been
in
the
possession
of
abraham
melchisedech
brought
it
with
him
from
the
land
of
semiramis
to
the
land
of
canaan
when
he
was
beginning
to
found
some
settlements
on
the
spot
where
jerusalem
was
afterwards
built
he
made
use
of
it
then
for
offering
sacrifice
when
he
offered
bread
and
wine
in
the
presence
of
abraham
and
he
left
it
in
the
possession
of
that
holy
patriarch
this
same
chalice
had
also
been
preserved
in
noah
ark
meditation
jesus
goes
up
to
jerusalem
in
the
morning
while
the
apostles
were
engaged
at
jerusalem
in
preparing
for
the
pasch
jesus
who
had
remained
at
bethania
took
an
affecting
leave
of
the
holy
women
of
lazarus
and
of
his
blessed
mother
and
gave
them
some
final
instructions
i
saw
our
lord
conversing
apart
with
his
mother
and
he
told
her
among
other
things
that
he
had
sent
peter
the
apostle
of
faith
and
john
the
apostle
of
love
to
prepare
for
the
pasch
at
jerusalem
he
said
in
speaking
of
magdalen
whose
grief
was
excessive
that
her
love
was
great
but
still
somewhat
human
and
that
on
this
account
her
sorrow
made
her
beside
herself
he
spoke
also
of
the
schemes
of
the
traitor
judas
and
the
blessed
virgin
prayed
for
him
judas
had
again
left
bethania
to
go
to
jerusalem
under
pretence
of
paying
some
debts
that
were
due
he
spent
his
whole
day
in
hurrying
backwards
and
forwards
from
one
pharisee
to
another
and
making
his
final
agreements
with
them
he
was
shown
the
soldiers
who
had
been
engaged
to
seize
the
person
of
our
divine
saviour
and
he
so
arranged
his
journeys
to
and
fro
as
to
be
able
to
account
for
his
absence
i
beheld
all
his
wicked
schemes
and
all
his
thoughts
he
was
naturally
active
and
obliging
but
these
good
qualities
were
choked
by
avarice
ambition
and
envy
which
passions
he
made
no
effort
to
control
in
our
lord
absence
he
had
even
performed
miracles
and
healed
the
sick
when
our
lord
announced
to
his
blessed
mother
what
was
going
to
take
place
she
besought
him
in
the
most
touching
terms
to
let
her
die
with
him
but
he
exhorted
her
to
show
more
calmness
in
her
sorrow
than
the
other
women
told
her
that
he
should
rise
again
and
named
the
very
spot
where
he
should
appear
to
her
she
did
not
weep
much
but
her
grief
was
indescribable
and
there
was
something
almost
awful
in
her
look
of
deep
recollection
our
divine
lord
returned
thanks
as
a
loving
son
for
all
the
love
she
had
borne
him
and
pressed
her
to
his
heart
he
also
told
her
that
he
would
make
the
last
supper
with
her
spiritually
and
named
the
hour
at
which
she
would
receive
his
precious
body
and
blood
then
once
more
he
in
touching
language
bade
farewell
to
all
and
gave
them
different
instructions
about
twelve
in
the
day
jesus
and
the
nine
apostles
went
from
bethania
up
to
jerusalem
followed
by
seven
disciples
who
with
the
exception
of
nathaniel
and
silas
came
from
jerusalem
and
the
neighbourhood
among
these
were
john
mark
and
the
son
of
the
poor
widow
who
the
thursday
previous
had
offered
her
mite
in
the
temple
whilst
jesus
was
preaching
there
jesus
had
taken
him
into
his
company
a
few
days
before
the
holy
women
set
off
later
jesus
and
his
companions
walked
around
mount
olivet
about
the
valley
of
josaphat
and
even
as
far
as
mount
calvary
during
the
whole
of
this
walk
he
continued
giving
them
instructions
he
told
the
apostles
among
other
things
that
until
then
he
had
given
them
his
bread
and
his
wine
but
that
this
day
he
was
going
to
give
them
his
body
and
blood
his
whole
self
all
that
he
had
and
all
that
he
was
the
countenance
of
our
lord
bore
so
touching
an
expression
whilst
he
was
speaking
that
his
whole
soul
seemed
to
breathe
forth
from
his
lips
and
he
appeared
to
be
languishing
with
love
and
desire
for
the
moment
when
he
should
give
himself
to
man
his
disciples
did
not
understand
him
but
thought
that
he
was
speaking
of
the
paschal
lamb
no
words
can
give
an
adequate
idea
of
the
love
and
resignation
which
were
expressed
in
these
last
discourses
of
our
lord
at
bethania
and
on
his
way
to
jerusalem
the
seven
disciples
who
had
followed
our
lord
to
jerusalem
did
not
go
there
in
his
company
but
carried
the
ceremonial
habits
for
the
pasch
to
the
and
then
returned
to
the
house
of
mary
the
mother
of
mark
when
peter
and
john
came
to
the
with
the
chalice
all
the
ceremonial
habits
were
already
in
the
vestibule
whither
they
had
been
brought
by
his
disciples
and
some
companions
they
had
also
hung
the
walls
with
drapery
cleared
the
higher
openings
in
the
sides
and
put
up
three
lamps
peter
and
john
then
went
to
the
valley
of
josaphat
and
summoned
our
lord
and
the
twelve
apostles
the
disciples
and
friends
who
were
also
to
make
their
pasch
in
the
supperroom
came
later
meditation
vi
the
last
pasch
jesus
and
his
disciples
ate
the
paschal
lamb
in
the
they
divided
into
three
groups
jesus
ate
the
paschal
lamb
with
the
twelve
apostles
in
the
properly
so
called
nathaniel
with
twelve
other
disciples
in
one
of
the
lateral
rooms
and
eliacim
the
son
of
cleophas
and
mary
the
daughter
of
heli
who
had
been
a
disciple
of
john
the
baptist
with
twelve
more
in
another
three
lambs
were
immolated
for
them
in
the
temple
but
there
was
a
fourth
lamb
which
was
immolated
in
the
and
was
the
one
eaten
by
jesus
with
his
apostles
judas
was
not
aware
of
this
circumstance
because
being
engaged
in
plotting
his
betrayal
of
our
lord
he
only
returned
a
few
moments
before
the
repast
and
after
the
immolation
of
the
lamb
had
taken
place
most
touching
was
the
scene
of
the
immolation
of
the
lamb
to
be
eaten
by
jesus
and
his
apostles
it
took
place
in
the
vestibule
of
the
the
apostles
and
disciples
were
present
singing
the
psalm
jesus
spoke
of
a
new
period
then
beginning
and
said
that
the
sacrifice
of
moses
and
the
figure
of
the
paschal
lamb
were
about
to
receive
their
accomplishment
but
that
on
this
very
account
the
lamb
was
to
be
immolated
in
the
same
manner
as
formerly
in
egypt
and
that
they
were
really
about
to
go
forth
from
the
house
of
bondage
the
vessels
and
necessary
instruments
were
prepared
and
then
the
attendants
brought
a
beautiful
little
lamb
decorated
with
a
crown
which
was
sent
to
the
blessed
virgin
in
the
room
where
she
had
remained
with
the
other
holy
women
the
lamb
was
fastened
with
its
back
against
a
board
by
a
cord
around
its
body
and
reminded
me
of
jesus
tied
to
the
pillar
and
scourged
the
son
of
simeon
held
the
lamb
head
jesus
made
a
slight
incision
in
its
neck
with
the
point
of
a
knife
which
he
then
gave
to
the
son
of
simeon
that
he
might
complete
killing
it
jesus
appeared
to
inflict
the
wound
with
a
feeling
of
repugnance
and
he
was
quick
in
his
movements
although
his
countenance
was
grave
and
his
manner
such
as
to
inspire
respect
the
blood
flowed
into
a
basin
and
the
attendants
brought
a
branch
of
hyssop
which
jesus
dipped
in
it
then
he
went
to
the
door
of
the
room
stained
the
sideposts
and
the
lock
with
blood
and
placed
the
branch
which
had
been
dipped
in
blood
above
the
door
he
then
spoke
to
the
disciples
and
told
them
among
other
things
that
the
exterminating
angel
would
pass
by
that
they
would
adore
in
that
room
without
fear
or
anxiety
when
he
the
true
paschal
lamb
should
have
been
immolated
that
a
new
epoch
and
a
new
sacrifice
were
about
to
begin
which
would
last
to
the
end
of
the
world
they
then
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
near
the
hearth
where
the
ark
of
the
covenant
had
formerly
stood
fire
had
already
been
lighted
there
and
jesus
poured
some
blood
upon
the
hearth
consecrating
it
as
an
altar
and
the
remainder
of
the
blood
and
the
fat
were
thrown
on
the
fire
beneath
the
altar
after
which
jesus
followed
by
his
apostles
walked
round
the
singing
some
psalms
and
consecrating
it
as
a
new
temple
the
doors
were
all
closed
during
this
time
meanwhile
the
son
of
simeon
had
completed
the
preparation
of
the
lamb
he
passed
a
stake
through
its
body
fastening
the
front
legs
on
a
cross
piece
of
wood
and
stretching
the
hind
ones
along
the
stake
it
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
jesus
on
the
cross
and
was
placed
in
the
oven
to
be
there
roasted
with
the
three
other
lambs
brought
from
the
temple
the
paschal
lambs
of
the
jews
were
all
immolated
in
the
vestibule
of
the
temple
but
in
different
parts
according
as
the
persons
who
were
to
eat
them
were
rich
or
poor
or
the
paschal
lamb
belonging
to
jesus
was
not
immolated
in
the
temple
but
everything
else
was
done
strictly
according
to
the
law
jesus
again
addressed
his
disciples
saying
that
the
lamb
was
but
a
figure
that
he
himself
would
next
day
be
the
true
paschal
lamb
together
with
other
things
which
i
have
forgotten
when
jesus
had
finished
his
instructions
concerning
the
paschal
lamb
and
its
signification
the
time
being
come
and
judas
also
returned
the
tables
were
set
out
the
disciples
put
on
travelling
dresses
which
were
in
the
vestibule
different
shoes
a
white
robe
resembling
a
shirt
and
a
cloak
which
was
short
in
front
and
longer
behind
their
sleeves
were
large
and
turned
back
and
they
girded
up
their
clothes
around
the
waist
each
party
went
to
their
own
table
and
two
sets
of
disciples
in
the
side
rooms
and
our
lord
and
his
apostles
in
the
they
held
staves
in
their
hands
and
went
two
and
two
to
the
table
where
they
remained
standing
each
in
his
own
place
with
the
stave
resting
on
his
arms
and
his
hands
upraised
the
table
was
narrow
and
about
half
a
foot
higher
than
the
knees
of
a
man
in
shape
it
resembled
a
horseshoe
and
opposite
jesus
in
the
inner
part
of
the
there
was
a
space
left
vacant
that
the
attendants
might
be
able
to
set
down
the
dishes
as
far
as
i
can
remember
john
james
the
greater
and
james
the
less

on
the
of
jesus
after
them
bartholomew
and
then
round
the
corner
thomas
and
judas
iscariot
peter
andrew
and
thaddeus
sat
on
the
left
of
jesus
next
came
simon
and
then
round
the
corner
matthew
and
philip
the
paschal
lamb
was
placed
on
a
dish
in
the
centre
of
the
table
its
head
rested
on
its
front
legs
which
were
fastened
to
a
its
hind
legs
being
stretched
out
and
the
dish
was
garnished
with
garlic
by
the
side
there
was
a
dish
with
the
paschal
roast
meat
then
came
a
plate
with
green
vegetables
balanced
against
each
other
and
another
plate
with
small
bundles
of
bitter
herbs
which
had
the
appearance
of
aromatic
herbs
opposite
jesus
there
was
also
one
dish
with
different
herbs
and
a
second
containing
a
sauce
of
beverage
the
guest
had
before
them
some
round
loaves
instead
of
plates
and
they
used
ivory
knives
after
the
prayer
the
laid
the
knife
for
cutting
the
lamb
on
the
table
before
jesus
who
placed
a
cup
of
wine
before
him
and
filled
six
other
cups
each
one
of
which
stood
between
two
apostles
jesus
blessed
the
wine
and
drank
and
the
apostles
drank
two
together
out
of
one
cup
then
our
lord
proceeded
to
cut
up
the
lamb
his
apostles
presented
their
pieces
of
bread
in
turn
and
each
received
his
share
they
ate
it
in
haste
separating
the
flesh
from
the
bone
by
means
of
their
ivory
knives
and
the
bones
were
afterwards
burnt
they
also
ate
the
garlic
and
green
herbs
in
haste
dipping
them
in
the
sauce
all
this
time
they
remained
standing
only
leaning
slightly
on
the
backs
of
their
seats
jesus
brake
one
of
the
loaves
of
unleavened
bread
covered
up
a
part
of
it
and
divided
the
remainder
among
his
apostles
another
cup
of
wine
was
brought
but
jesus
drank
not
of
it
this
he
said
divide
it
among
you
for
i
will
not
drink
from
henceforth
of
the
fruit
of
the
vine
until
that
day
when
i
shall
drink
it
with
you
new
in
the
kingdom
of
my
father
matt
when
they
had
drunk
the
wine
they
sang
a
hymn
then
jesus
prayed
or
taught
and
they
again
washed
their
hands
after
this
they
sat
down
our
lord
cut
up
another
lamb
which
was
carried
to
the
holy
women
in
one
of
the
buildings
of
the
court
where
they
were
seated
at
table
the
apostles
ate
some
more
vegetables
and
lettuce
the
countenance
of
our
divine
saviour
bore
an
indescribable
expression
of
serenity
and
recollection
greater
than
i
had
ever
before
seen
he
bade
the
apostles
forget
all
their
cares
the
blessed
virgin
also
as
she
sat
at
table
with
the
other
women
looked
most
placid
and
calm
when
the
other
women
came
up
and
took
hold
of
her
veil
to
make
her
turn
round
and
speak
to
them
her
every
movement
expressed
the
sweetest
and
placidity
of
spirit
at
first
jesus
conversed
lovingly
and
calmly
with
his
disciples
but
after
a
while
he
became
grave
and
sad
amen
i
say
to
you
that
one
of
you
is
about
to
betray
me
he
said
he
that
dippeth
his
hand
with
me
in
the
dish
matt
jesus
was
then
distributing
the
lettuce
of
which
there
was
only
one
dish
to
those
apostles
who
were
by
his
side
and
he
had
given
judas
who
was
nearly
opposite
to
him
the
office
of
distributing
it
to
the
others
when
jesus
spoke
of
a
traitor
an
expression
which
filled
all
the
apostles
with
fear
he
said
that
dippeth
his
hand
with
me
in
the
dish
which
means
of
the
twelve
who
are
eating
and
drinking
with
me
one
of
those
with
whom
i
am
eating
bread
he
did
not
plainly
point
out
judas
to
the
others
by
these
words
for
to
dip
the
hand
in
the
same
dish
was
an
expression
used
to
signify
the
most
friendly
and
intimate
intercourse
he
was
desirous
however
to
give
a
warning
to
judas
who
was
then
really
dipping
his
hand
in
the
dish
with
our
saviour
to
distribute
the
lettuce
jesus
continued
to
speak
son
of
man
indeed
goeth
he
said
it
is
written
of
him
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
son
of
man
shall
be
betrayed
it
were
better
for
him
if
that
man
had
not
been
born
the
apostles
were
very
much
troubled
and
each
one
of
them
exclaimed
is
it
i
for
they
were
all
perfectly
aware
that
they
did
not
entirely
understand
his
words
peter
leaned
towards
john
behind
jesus
and
made
him
a
sign
to
ask
our
lord
who
the
traitor
was
to
be
for
having
so
often
been
reproved
by
our
lord
he
trembled
lest
it
should
be
himself
who
was
referred
to
john
was
seated
at
the
right
hand
of
jesus
and
as
all
were
leaning
on
their
left
arms
using
the
right
to
eat
his
head
was
close
to
the
bosom
of
jesus
he
leaned
then
on
his
breast
and
said
who
is
it
i
did
not
see
jesus
say
to
him
with
his
lips
it
is
to
whom
i
shall
reach
bread
dipped
i
do
not
know
whether
he
whispered
it
to
him
but
john
knew
it
when
jesus
having
dipped
the
bread
which
was
covered
with
lettuce
gave
it
tenderly
to
judas
who
also
asked
it
i
lord
jesus
looked
at
him
with
love
and
answered
him
in
general
terms
among
the
jews
to
give
bread
dipped
was
a
mark
of
friendship
and
confidence
jesus
on
this
occasion
gave
judas
the
morsel
in
order
thus
to
warn
him
without
making
known
his
guilt
to
the
others
but
the
heart
of
judas
burned
with
anger
and
during
the
whole
time
of
the
repast
i
saw
a
frightful
little
figure
seated
at
his
feet
and
sometimes
ascending
to
his
heart
i
did
not
see
john
repeat
to
peter
what
he
had
learned
from
jesus
but
he
set
his
fears
at
rest
by
a
look
meditation
vii
the
washing
of
the
feet
they
arose
from
table
and
whilst
they
were
arranging
their
clothes
as
they
usually
did
before
making
their
solemn
prayer
the
came
in
with
two
servants
to
take
away
the
table
jesus
standing
in
the
midst
of
his
apostles
spoke
to
them
long
in
a
most
solemn
manner
i
could
not
repeat
exactly
his
whole
discourse
but
i
remember
he
spoke
of
his
kingdom
of
his
going
to
his
father
of
what
he
would
leave
them
now
that
he
was
about
to
be
taken
away
etc
he
also
gave
them
some
instructions
concerning
penance
the
confession
of
sin
repentance
and
justification
i
felt
that
these
instructions
referred
to
the
washing
of
the
feet
and
i
saw
that
all
the
apostles
acknowledged
their
sins
and
repented
of
them
with
the
exception
of
judas
this
discourse
was
long
and
solemn
when
it
was
concluded
jesus
sent
john
and
james
the
less
to
fetch
water
from
the
vestibule
and
he
told
the
apostles
to
arrange
the
seats
in
a
half
circle
he
went
himself
into
the
vestibule
where
he
girded
himself
with
a
towel
during
this
time
the
apostles
spoke
among
themselves
and
began
speculating
as
to
which
of
them
would
be
the
greatest
for
our
lord
having
expressly
announced
that
he
was
about
to
leave
them
and
that
his
kingdom
was
near
at
hand
they
felt
strengthened
anew
in
their
idea
that
he
had
secret
plans
and
that
he
was
referring
to
some
earthly
triumph
which
would
be
theirs
at
the
last
moment
meanwhile
jesus
in
the
vestibule
told
john
to
take
a
basin
and
james
a
pitcher
filled
with
water
with
which
they
followed
him
into
the
room
where
the
had
placed
another
empty
basin
jesus
on
returning
to
his
disciples
in
so
humble
a
manner
addressed
them
a
few
words
of
reproach
on
the
subject
of
the
dispute
which
had
arisen
between
them
and
said
among
other
things
that
he
himself
was
their
servant
and
that
they
were
to
sit
down
for
him
to
wash
their
feet
they
sat
down
therefore
in
the
same
order
as
they
had
sat
at
table
jesus
went
from
one
to
the
other
poured
water
from
the
basin
which
john
carried
on
the
feet
of
each
and
then
taking
the
end
of
the
towel
wherewith
he
was
girded
wiped
them
most
loving
and
tender
was
the
manner
of
our
lord
while
thus
humbling
himself
at
the
feet
of
his
apostles
peter
when
his
turn
came
endeavoured
through
humility
to
prevent
jesus
from
washing
his
feet
he
exclaimed
thou
wash
my
feet
jesus
answered
i
do
thou
knowest
not
now
but
thou
shalt
know
hereafter
it
appeared
to
me
that
he
said
to
him
privately
thou
hast
merited
for
my
father
to
reveal
to
thee
who
i
am
whence
i
come
and
whither
i
am
going
thou
alone
hast
expressly
confessed
it
therefore
upon
thee
will
i
build
my
church
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
it
my
power
will
remain
with
thy
successors
to
the
end
of
the
world
jesus
showed
him
to
the
other
apostles
and
said
that
when
he
should
be
no
more
present
among
them
peter
was
to
fill
his
place
in
their
regard
peter
said
shalt
never
wash
my
feet
our
lord
replied
i
wash
thee
not
thou
shalt
have
no
part
with
me
then
peter
exclaimed
not
only
my
feet
but
also
my
hands
and
my
head
jesus
replied
that
is
washed
needeth
not
but
to
wash
his
feet
but
is
clean
wholly
and
you
are
clean
but
not
all
by
these
last
words
he
referred
to
judas
he
had
spoken
of
the
washing
of
the
feet
as
signifying
purification
from
daily
faults
because
the
feet
which
are
continually
in
contact
with
the
earth
are
also
continually
liable
to
be
soiled
unless
great
care
is
taken
this
washing
of
the
feet
was
spiritual
and
served
as
a
species
of
absolution
peter
in
his
zeal
saw
nothing
in
it
but
too
great
an
act
of
abasement
on
the
part
of
his
master
he
knew
not
that
to
save
him
jesus
would
the
very
next
day
humble
himself
even
to
the
ignominious
death
of
the
cross
when
jesus
washed
the
feet
of
judas
it
was
in
the
most
loving
and
affecting
manner
he
bent
his
sacred
face
even
on
to
the
feet
of
the
traitor
and
in
a
low
voice
bade
him
now
at
least
enter
into
himself
for
that
he
had
been
a
faithless
traitor
for
the
last
year
judas
appeared
to
be
anxious
to
pay
no
heed
whatever
to
his
words
and
spoke
to
john
upon
which
peter
became
angry
and
exclaimed
the
master
speaks
to
thee
then
judas
made
our
lord
some
vague
evasive
reply
such
as
forbid
lord
the
others
had
not
remarked
that
jesus
was
speaking
to
judas
for
this
words
were
uttered
in
a
low
voice
in
order
not
to
be
heard
by
them
and
besides
they
were
engaged
in
putting
on
their
shoes
nothing
in
the
whole
course
of
the
passion
grieved
jesus
so
deeply
as
the
treason
of
judas
jesus
finally
washed
the
feet
of
john
and
james
he
then
spoke
again
on
the
subject
of
humility
telling
them
that
he
that
was
the
greatest
among
them
was
to
be
as
their
servant
and
that
henceforth
they
were
to
wash
one
another
feet
then
he
put
on
his
garments
and
the
apostles
let
down
their
clothes
which
they
had
girded
up
before
eating
the
paschal
lamb
meditation
viii
institution
of
the
holy
eucharist
by
command
of
our
lord
the
had
again
laid
out
the
table
which
he
had
raised
a
little
then
having
placed
it
once
more
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
stood
one
urn
filled
with
wine
and
another
with
water
underneath
it
peter
and
john
went
into
the
part
of
the
room
near
the
hearth
to
get
the
chalice
which
they
had
brought
from
house
and
which
was
still
wrapped
up
in
its
covering
they
carried
it
between
them
as
if
they
had
been
carrying
a
tabernacle
and
placed
it
on
the
table
before
jesus
an
oval
plate
stood
there
with
three
fine
white
azymous
loaves
placed
on
a
piece
of
linen
by
the
side
of
the
half
loaf
which
jesus
had
set
aside
during
the
paschal
meal
also
a
jar
containing
wine
and
water
and
three
boxes
one
filled
with
thick
oil
a
second
with
liquid
oil
and
the
third
empty
in
earlier
times
it
had
been
the
practice
for
all
at
table
to
eat
of
the
same
loaf
and
drink
of
the
same
cup
at
the
end
of
the
meal
thereby
to
express
their
friendship
and
brotherly
love
and
to
welcome
and
bid
farewell
to
each
other
i
think
scripture
must
contain
something
upon
this
subject
on
the
day
of
the
last
supper
jesus
raised
this
custom
which
had
hitherto
been
no
more
than
a
symbolical
and
figurative
rite
to
the
dignity
of
the
holiest
of
sacraments
one
of
the
charges
brought
before
caiphas
on
occasion
of
the
treason
of
judas
was
that
jesus
had
introduced
a
novelty
into
the
paschal
ceremonies
but
nicodemus
proved
from
scripture
that
it
was
an
ancient
practice
jesus
was
seated
between
peter
and
john
the
doors
were
closed
and
everything
was
done
in
the
most
mysterious
and
imposing
manner
when
the
chalice
was
taken
out
of
its
covering
jesus
prayed
and
spoke
to
his
apostles
with
the
utmost
solemnity
i
saw
him
giving
them
an
explanation
of
the
supper
and
of
the
entire
ceremony
and
i
was
forcibly
reminded
of
a
priest
teaching
others
to
say
mass
he
then
drew
a
species
of
shelf
with
grooves
from
the
boars
on
which
the
jars
stood
and
taking
a
piece
of
white
linen
with
which
the
chalice
was
covered
spread
it
over
the
board
and
shelf
i
then
saw
him
lift
a
round
plate
which
he
placed
on
this
same
shelf
off
the
top
of
the
chalice
he
next
took
the
azymous
loaves
from
beneath
the
linen
with
which
they
were
covered
and
placed
them
before
him
on
the
board
then
he
took
out
of
the
chalice
a
smaller
vase
and
ranged
the
six
little
glasses
on
each
side
of
it
then
he
blessed
the
bread
and
also
the
oil
to
the
best
of
my
belief
after
which
he
lifted
up
the
paten
with
the
loaves
upon
it
in
his
two
hands
raised
his
eyes
prayed
offered
and
replaced
the
paten
on
the
table
covering
it
up
again
he
then
took
the
chalice
had
some
wine
poured
into
it
by
peter
and
some
water
which
he
first
blessed
by
john
adding
to
it
a
little
more
water
which
he
poured
into
a
small
spoon
and
after
this
he
blessed
the
chalice
raised
it
up
with
a
prayer
made
the
oblation
and
replaced
it
on
the
table
john
and
peter
poured
some
water
on
his
hands
which
he
held
over
the
plate
on
which
the
azymous
loaves
had
been
placed
then
he
took
a
little
of
the
water
which
had
been
poured
on
his
hands
in
the
spoon
that
he
had
taken
out
of
the
lower
part
of
the
chalice
and
poured
it
on
theirs
after
this
the
vase
was
passed
round
the
table
and
all
the
apostles
washed
their
hands
in
it
i
do
not
remember
whether
this
was
the
precise
order
in
which
these
ceremonies
were
performed
all
i
know
is
that
they
reminded
me
in
a
striking
manner
of
the
holy
sacrifice
of
the
mass
meanwhile
our
divine
lord
became
more
and
more
tender
and
loving
in
his
demeanour
he
told
his
apostles
that
he
was
about
to
give
them
all
that
he
had
namely
his
entire
self
and
he
looked
as
though
perfectly
transformed
by
love
i
saw
him
becoming
transparent
until
he
resembled
a
luminous
shadow
he
broke
the
bread
into
several
pieces
which
he
laid
together
on
the
paten
and
then
took
a
corner
of
the
first
piece
and
dripped
it
into
the
chalice
at
the
moment
when
he
was
doing
this
i
seemed
to
see
the
blessed
virgin
receiving
the
holy
sacrament
in
a
spiritual
manner
although
she
was
not
present
in
the
i
do
not
know
how
it
was
done
but
i
thought
i
saw
her
enter
without
touching
the
ground
and
come
before
our
lord
to
receive
the
holy
eucharist
after
which
i
saw
her
no
more
jesus
had
told
her
in
the
morning
at
bethania
that
he
would
keep
the
pasch
with
her
spiritually
and
he
had
named
the
hour
at
which
she
was
to
betake
herself
to
prayer
in
order
to
receive
it
in
spirit
again
he
prayed
and
taught
his
words
came
forth
from
his
lips
like
fire
and
light
and
entered
into
each
of
the
apostles
with
the
exception
of
judas
he
took
the
paten
with
the
pieces
of
bread
i
do
not
know
whether
he
had
placed
it
on
the
chalice
and
said
and
eat
this
is
my
body
which
is
given
for
you
he
stretched
forth
his
right
hand
as
if
to
bless
and
whilst
he
did
so
a
brilliant
light
came
from
him
his
words
were
luminous
the
bread
entered
the
mouths
of
the
apostles
as
a
brilliant
substance
and
light
seemed
to
penetrate
and
surround
them
all
judas
alone
remaining
dark
jesus
presented
the
bread
first
to
peter
next
to
john
and
then
he
made
a
sign
to
judas
to
judas
was
thus
the
third
who
received
the
adorable
sacrament
but
the
words
of
our
lord
appeared
to
turn
aside
from
the
mouth
of
the
traitor
and
come
back
to
their
divine
author
so
perturbed
was
i
in
spirit
at
this
sight
that
my
feelings
can
not
be
described
jesus
said
to
him
which
thou
dost
do
quickly
he
then
administered
the
blessed
sacrament
to
the
other
apostles
who
approached
two
and
two
jesus
raised
the
chalice
by
its
two
handles
to
a
level
with
his
face
and
pronounced
the
words
of
consecration
whilst
doing
so
he
appeared
wholly
transfigured
as
it
were
transparent
and
as
though
entirely
passing
into
what
he
was
going
to
give
his
apostles
he
made
peter
and
john
drink
from
the
chalice
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
then
placed
it
again
on
the
table
john
poured
the
divine
blood
from
the
chalice
into
the
smaller
glasses
and
peter
presented
them
to
the
apostles
two
of
whom
drank
together
out
of
the
same
cup
i
think
but
am
not
quite
certain
that
judas
also
partook
of
the
chalice
he
did
not
return
to
his
place
but
immediately
left
the
and
the
other
apostles
thought
that
jesus
had
given
him
some
commission
to
do
he
left
without
praying
or
making
any
thanksgiving
and
hence
you
may
perceive
how
sinful
it
is
to
neglect
returning
thanks
either
after
receiving
our
daily
food
or
after
partaking
of
the
bread
of
angels
during
the
entire
meal
i
had
seen
a
frightful
little
figure
with
one
foot
like
a
dried
bone
remaining
close
to
judas
but
when
he
had
reached
the
door
i
beheld
three
devils
pressing
round
him
one
entered
into
his
mouth
the
second
urged
him
on
and
the
third
preceded
him
it
was
night
and
they
seemed
to
be
lighting
him
whilst
he
hurried
onward
like
a
madman
our
lord
poured
a
few
drops
of
the
precious
blood
remaining
in
the
chalice
into
the
little
vase
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
and
then
placed
his
fingers
over
the
chalice
while
peter
and
john
poured
water
and
wine
upon
them
this
done
he
caused
them
to
drink
again
from
the
chalice
and
what
remained
of
its
contents
was
poured
into
the
smaller
glasses
and
distributed
to
the
other
apostles
then
jesus
wiped
the
chalice
put
into
it
the
little
vase
containing
the
remainder
of
the
divine
blood
and
placed
over
it
the
paten
with
the
fragments
of
the
consecrated
bread
after
which
he
again
put
on
the
cover
wrapped
up
the
chalice
and
stood
it
in
the
midst
of
the
six
small
cups
i
saw
the
apostles
receive
in
communion
these
remains
of
the
adorable
sacrament
after
the
resurrection
i
do
not
remember
seeing
our
lord
himself
eat
and
drink
of
the
consecrated
elements
neither
did
i
see
melchisedech
when
offering
the
bread
and
wine
taste
of
them
himself
it
was
made
known
to
me
why
priests
partake
of
them
although
jesus
did
not
here
sister
emmerich
looked
suddenly
up
and
appeared
to
be
listening
some
explanation
was
given
her
on
this
subject
but
the
following
words
were
all
that
she
could
repeat
to
us
the
office
of
distributing
it
had
been
given
to
angels
they
would
not
have
partaken
but
if
priests
did
not
partake
the
blessed
eucharist
would
be
lost
it
is
through
their
participation
that
it
is
preserved
there
was
an
indescribable
solemnity
and
order
in
all
the
actions
of
jesus
during
the
institution
of
the
holy
eucharist
and
his
every
movement
was
most
majestic
i
saw
the
apostles
noting
things
down
in
the
little
rolls
of
parchment
which
they
carried
on
their
persons
several
times
during
the
ceremonies
i
remarked
that
they
bowed
to
each
other
in
the
same
way
that
our
priests
do
meditation
ix
private
instruction
and
consecrations
jesus
gave
his
apostles
some
private
instructions
he
told
them
how
they
were
to
preserve
the
blessed
sacrament
in
memory
of
him
even
to
the
end
of
the
world
he
taught
them
the
necessary
forms
for
making
use
of
and
communicating
it
and
in
what
manner
they
were
by
degrees
to
teach
and
publish
this
mystery
finally
he
told
them
when
they
were
to
receive
what
remained
of
the
consecrated
elements
when
to
give
some
to
the
blessed
virgin
and
how
to
consecrate
themselves
after
he
should
have
sent
them
the
divine
comforter
he
then
spoke
concerning
the
priesthood
the
sacred
unction
and
the
preparation
of
the
chrism
and
holy
he
had
there
three
boxes
two
of
which
contained
a
mixture
of
oil
and
balm
he
taught
them
how
to
make
this
mixture
what
parts
of
the
body
were
to
be
anointed
with
them
and
upon
what
occasions
i
remember
among
other
things
that
he
mentioned
a
case
in
which
the
holy
eucharist
could
not
be
administered
perhaps
what
he
said
had
reference
to
extreme
unction
for
my
recollections
on
this
point
are
not
very
clear
he
spoke
of
different
kinds
of
anointing
and
in
particular
of
that
of
kings
and
he
said
that
even
wicked
kings
who
were
anointed
derived
from
it
especial
powers
he
put
ointment
and
oil
in
the
empty
box
and
mixed
them
together
but
i
can
not
say
for
certain
whether
it
was
at
this
moment
or
at
the
time
of
the
consecration
of
the
bread
that
he
blessed
the
oil
i
then
saw
jesus
anoint
peter
and
john
on
whose
hands
he
had
already
poured
the
water
which
had
flowed
on
his
own
and
two
whom
he
had
given
to
drink
out
of
the
chalice
then
he
laid
his
hands
on
their
shoulders
and
heads
while
they
on
their
part
joined
their
hands
and
crossed
their
thumbs
bowing
down
profoundly
before
him
i
am
not
sure
whether
they
did
not
even
kneel
he
anointed
the
thumb
and
of
each
of
their
hands
and
marked
a
cross
on
their
heads
with
chrism
he
said
also
that
this
would
remain
with
them
unto
the
end
of
the
world
james
the
less
andrew
james
the
greater
and
bartholomew
were
also
consecrated
i
saw
likewise
that
on
peter
bosom
he
crossed
a
sort
of
stole
worn
round
the
neck
whilst
on
the
others
he
simply
placed
it
crosswise
from
the
right
shoulder
to
the
left
side
i
do
not
know
whether
this
was
done
at
the
time
of
the
institution
of
the
blessed
sacrament
or
only
for
the
anointing
i
understood
that
jesus
communicated
to
them
by
this
unction
something
essential
and
supernatural
beyond
my
power
to
describe
he
told
them
that
when
they
should
have
received
the
holy
spirit
they
were
to
consecrate
the
bread
and
wine
and
anoint
the
other
apostles
it
was
made
known
to
me
then
that
on
the
day
of
pentecost
peter
and
john
imposed
their
hands
upon
the
other
apostles
and
a
week
later
upon
several
of
the
disciples
after
the
resurrection
john
gave
the
adorable
sacrament
for
the
first
time
to
the
blessed
virgin
it
is
a
festival
no
longer
kept
in
the
church
on
earth
but
i
see
it
celebrated
in
the
church
triumphant
for
the
first
few
days
after
pentecost
i
saw
only
peter
and
john
consecrate
the
blessed
eucharist
but
after
that
the
others
also
consecrated
our
lord
next
proceeded
to
bless
fire
in
a
brass
vessel
and
care
was
taken
that
it
should
not
go
out
but
it
was
kept
near
the
spot
where
the
blessed
sacrament
had
been
deposited
in
one
division
of
the
ancient
paschal
hearth
and
fire
was
always
taken
from
it
when
needed
for
spiritual
purposes
all
that
jesus
did
upon
this
occasion
was
done
in
private
and
taught
equally
in
private
the
church
has
retained
all
that
was
essential
of
these
secret
instructions
and
under
the
inspiration
of
the
holy
ghost
developed
and
adapted
them
to
all
her
requirements
whether
peter
and
john
were
both
consecrated
bishops
or
peter
alone
as
bishop
and
john
as
priest
or
to
what
dignity
the
other
four
apostles
were
raised
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
but
the
different
ways
in
which
our
lord
arranged
the
apostles
stoles
appear
to
indicate
different
degrees
of
consecration
when
these
holy
ceremonies
were
concluded
the
chalice
near
which
the
blessed
chrism
also
stood
was
and
the
adorable
sacrament
carried
by
peter
and
john
into
the
back
part
of
the
room
which
was
divided
off
by
a
curtain
and
from
thenceforth
became
the
sanctuary
the
spot
where
the
blessed
sacrament
was
deposited
was
not
very
far
above
the
paschal
stove
joseph
of
arimathea
and
nicodemus
took
care
of
the
sanctuary
and
of
the
during
the
absence
of
the
apostles
jesus
again
instructed
his
apostles
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
and
also
prayed
several
times
he
frequently
appeared
to
be
conversing
with
his
heavenly
father
and
to
be
overflowing
with
enthusiasm
and
love
the
apostles
also
were
full
of
joy
and
zeal
and
asked
him
various
questions
which
he
forthwith
answered
the
scriptures
must
contain
much
of
this
last
discourse
and
conversation
he
told
peter
and
john
different
things
to
be
made
known
later
to
the
other
apostles
who
in
their
turn
were
to
communicate
them
to
the
disciples
and
holy
women
according
to
the
capacity
of
each
for
such
knowledge
he
had
a
private
conversation
with
john
whom
he
told
that
his
life
would
be
longer
than
the
lives
of
the
others
he
spoke
to
him
also
concerning
seven
churches
some
crowns
and
angels
and
instructed
him
in
the
meaning
of
certain
mysterious
figures
which
signified
to
the
best
of
my
belief
different
epochs
the
other
apostles
were
slightly
jealous
of
this
confidential
communication
being
made
to
john
jesus
spoke
also
of
the
traitor
he
is
doing
this
or
that
he
said
and
i
in
fact
saw
judas
doing
exactly
as
he
said
of
him
as
peter
was
vehemently
protesting
that
he
would
always
remain
faithful
our
lord
said
to
him
simon
behold
satan
hath
desired
to
have
you
that
he
may
sift
you
as
wheat
but
i
have
prayed
for
thee
that
thy
faith
fail
not
and
thou
being
once
converted
confirm
thy
brethren
again
our
lord
said
that
whither
he
was
going
they
could
not
follow
him
when
peter
exclaimed
i
am
ready
to
go
with
thee
both
into
prison
and
to
death
and
jesus
replied
amen
i
say
to
thee
before
the
cock
crow
twice
thou
shalt
deny
me
thrice
jesus
while
making
known
to
his
apostles
that
trying
times
were
at
hand
for
them
said
i
sent
you
without
purse
or
scrip
or
shoes
did
you
want
anything
they
answered
now
he
continued
that
hath
a
purse
let
him
take
it
and
likewise
a
scrip
and
he
that
hath
not
let
him
sell
his
coat
and
buy
a
sword
for
i
say
to
you
that
this
that
is
written
must
yet
be
fulfilled
in
me
and
with
the
wicked
was
he
reckoned
for
the
things
concerning
me
have
an
end
the
apostles
only
understood
his
words
in
a
carnal
sense
and
peter
showed
him
two
swords
which
were
short
and
thick
like
cleavers
jesus
said
is
enough
let
us
go
hence
then
they
sang
the
thanksgiving
hymn
put
the
table
on
one
side
and
went
into
the
vestibule
there
jesus
found
his
mother
mary
of
cleophas
and
magdalen
who
earnestly
besought
him
not
to
go
to
mount
olivet
for
a
report
has
spread
that
his
enemies
were
seeking
to
lay
hands
on
him
but
jesus
comforted
them
in
few
words
and
hastened
onward
it
being
then
about
nine
they
went
down
the
road
by
which
peter
and
john
had
come
to
the
and
directed
their
steps
towards
mount
olivet
i
have
always
seen
the
pasch
and
the
institution
of
the
blessed
sacrament
take
place
in
the
order
related
above
but
my
feelings
were
each
time
so
strongly
excited
and
my
emotion
so
great
that
i
could
not
give
much
attention
to
all
the
details
but
now
i
have
seen
them
more
distinctly
no
words
can
describe
how
painful
and
exhausting
is
such
a
sight
as
that
of
beholding
the
hidden
recesses
of
hearts
the
love
and
constancy
of
our
saviour
and
to
know
at
the
same
time
all
that
is
going
to
befall
him
how
would
it
be
possible
to
observe
all
that
is
merely
external
the
heart
is
overflowing
with
admiration
gratitude
and
love
the
blindness
of
men
seems
perfectly
incomprehensible
and
the
soul
is
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
at
the
thought
of
the
ingratitude
of
the
whole
world
and
of
her
own
sins
the
eating
of
the
paschal
lamb
was
performed
by
jesus
rapidly
and
in
entire
conformity
with
all
the
legal
ordinances
the
pharisees
were
in
the
habit
of
adding
some
minute
and
superstitious
ceremonies
the
passion
if
thou
knowest
not
how
to
meditate
on
high
and
heavenly
things
rest
on
the
passion
of
christ
and
willingly
dwell
in
his
sacred
wounds
for
if
thou
fly
devoutly
to
the
wounds
and
precious
stigmas
of
jesus
thou
shalt
feel
great
comfort
in
tribulation
imitation

book
chapter
introduction
on
the
evening
of
the
of
february
a
friend
of
sister
emmerich
went
up
to
the
bed
where
she
was
lying
apparently
asleep
and
being
much
struck
by
the
beautiful
and
mournful
expression
of
her
countenance
felt
himself
inwardly
inspired
to
raise
his
heart
fervently
to
god
and
offer
the
passion
of
christ
to
the
eternal
father
in
union
with
the
sufferings
of
all
those
who
have
carried
their
cross
after
him
while
making
this
short
prayer
he
chanced
to
fix
his
eyes
for
a
moment
upon
the
stigmatised
hands
of
sister
emmerich
she
immediately
hid
them
under
the
counterpane
starting
as
if
someone
had
given
her
a
blow
he
felt
surprised
at
this
and
asked
her
has
happened
to
you
things
she
answered
in
an
expressive
tone
whilst
he
was
considering
what
her
meaning
could
be
she
appeared
to
be
asleep
at
the
end
of
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
suddenly
started
up
with
all
the
eagerness
of
a
person
having
a
violent
struggle
with
another
stretched
out
both
her
arms
clenching
her
hand
as
if
to
repel
an
enemy
standing
on
the
left
side
of
her
bed
and
exclaimed
in
an
indignant
voice
do
you
mean
by
this
contract
of
magdalum
then
she
continued
to
speak
with
the
warmth
of
a
person
who
is
being
questioned
during
a
quarrel
it
is
that
accursed
spirit
the
liar
from
the
beginning
satan
who
is
reproaching
him
about
the
magdalum
contract
and
other
things
of
the
same
nature
and
says
that
he
spent
all
that
money
upon
himself
when
asked
has
spent
money
who
is
being
spoken
to
in
that
way
she
replied
my
adorable
spouse
on
mount
olivet
then
she
again
turned
to
the
left
with
menacing
gestures
and
exclaimed
meanest
thou
o
father
of
lies
with
thy
magdalum
contract
did
he
not
deliver
poor
prisoners
at
thirza
with
the
money
derived
from
the
sale
of
magdalum
i
saw
him
and
thou
darest
to
say
that
he
has
brought
confusion
into
the
whole
estate
driven
out
its
inhabitants
and
squandered
the
money
for
which
it
was
sold
but
thy
time
is
come
accursed
spirit
thou
wilt
be
chained
and
his
heel
will
crush
thy
head
here
she
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
another
person
her
friends
thought
that
she
was
in
delirium
and
pitied
her
the
following
morning
she
owned
that
the
previous
night
she
had
imagined
herself
to
be
following
our
saviour
to
the
garden
of
olives
after
the
institution
of
the
blessed
eucharist
but
that
just
at
that
moment
someone
having
looked
at
the
stigmas
on
her
hands
with
a
degree
of
veneration
she
felt
so
horrified
at
this
being
done
in
the
presence
of
our
lord
that
she
hastily
hid
them
with
a
feeling
of
pain
she
then
related
her
vision
of
what
took
place
in
the
garden
of
olives
and
as
she
continued
her
narrations
the
following
days
the
friend
who
was
listening
to
her
was
enabled
to
connect
the
different
scenes
of
the
passion
together
but
as
during
lent
she
was
also
celebrating
the
combats
of
our
lord
with
satan
in
the
desert
she
had
to
endure
in
her
own
person
many
sufferings
and
temptations
hence
there
were
a
few
pauses
in
the
history
of
the
passion
which
were
however
easily
filled
up
by
means
of
some
later
communications
she
usually
spoke
in
common
german
but
when
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
her
language
became
much
purer
and
her
narrations
partook
at
once
of
simplicity
and
dignified
inspiration
her
friend
wrote
down
all
that
she
had
said
directly
he
returned
to
his
own
apartments
for
it
was
seldom
that
he
could
so
much
as
even
take
notes
in
her
presence
the
giver
of
all
good
gifts
bestowed
upon
him
memory
zeal
and
strength
to
bear
much
trouble
and
fatigue
so
that
he
has
been
enabled
to
bring
this
work
to
a
conclusion
his
conscience
tells
him
that
he
has
done
his
best
and
he
humbly
begs
the
reader
if
satisfied
with
the
result
of
his
labours
to
bestow
upon
him
the
alms
of
an
occasional
prayer
chapter
jesus
in
the
garden
of
olives
when
jesus
left
the
with
the
eleven
apostles
after
the
institution
of
the
adorable
sacrament
of
the
altar
his
soul
was
deeply
oppressed
and
his
sorrow
on
the
increase
he
led
the
eleven
by
an
unfrequented
path
to
the
valley
of
josaphat
as
they
left
the
house
i
saw
the
moon
which
was
not
yet
quite
at
the
full
rising
in
front
of
the
mountain
our
divine
lord
as
he
wandered
with
his
apostles
about
the
valley
told
them
that
here
he
should
one
day
return
to
judge
the
world
but
not
in
a
state
of
poverty
and
humiliation
as
he
then
was
and
that
men
would
tremble
with
fear
and
cry
fall
upon
us
his
disciples
did
not
understand
him
and
thought
by
no
means
for
the
first
time
that
night
that
weakness
and
exhaustion
had
affected
his
brain
he
said
to
them
again
you
shall
be
scandalised
in
me
this
night
for
it
is
written
i
will
strike
the
shepherd
and
the
sheep
of
the
flock
shall
be
dispersed
but
after
i
shall
be
risen
again
i
will
go
before
you
into
galilee
the
apostles
were
still
in
some
degree
animated
by
the
spirit
of
enthusiasm
and
devotion
with
which
their
reception
of
the
blessed
sacrament
and
the
solemn
and
affecting
words
of
jesus
had
inspired
them
they
eagerly
crowded
round
him
and
expressed
their
love
in
a
thousand
different
ways
earnestly
protesting
that
they
would
never
abandon
him
but
as
jesus
continued
to
talk
in
the
same
strain
peter
exclaimed
all
shall
be
scandalised
in
thee
i
will
never
be
scandalised
and
our
lord
answered
him
i
say
to
thee
that
in
this
night
before
the
cock
crow
thou
wilt
deny
me
thrice
but
peter
still
insisted
saying
though
i
should
die
with
thee
i
will
not
deny
thee
and
the
others
all
said
the
same
they
walked
onward
and
stopped
by
turns
for
the
sadness
of
our
divine
lord
continued
to
increase
the
apostles
tried
to
comfort
him
by
human
arguments
assuring
him
that
what
he
foresaw
would
not
come
to
pass
they
tired
themselves
in
these
vain
efforts
began
to
doubt
and
were
assailed
by
temptation
they
crossed
the
brook
cedron
not
by
the
bridge
where
a
few
hours
later
jesus
was
taken
prisoner
but
by
another
for
they
had
left
the
direct
road
gethsemani
whither
they
were
going
was
about
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
from
the
for
it
was
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
the
to
the
valley
of
josaphat
and
about
as
far
from
thence
to
gethsemani
the
place
called
gethsemani
where
latterly
jesus
had
several
times
passed
the
night
with
his
disciples
was
a
large
garden
surrounded
by
a
hedge
and
containing
only
some
fruit
trees
and
flowers
while
outside
there
stood
a
few
deserted
unclosed
buildings
the
apostles
and
several
others
persons
had
keys
of
this
garden
which
was
used
sometimes
as
a
pleasure
ground
and
sometimes
as
a
place
of
retirement
for
prayer
some
arbours
made
of
leaves
and
branches
had
been
raised
there
and
eight
of
the
apostles
remained
in
them
and
were
later
joined
by
others
of
the
disciples
the
garden
of
olives
was
separated
by
a
road
from
that
of
gethsemani
and
was
open
surrounded
only
by
an
earthern
wall
and
smaller
than
the
garden
of
gethsemani
there
were
caverns
terraces
and
many
to
be
seen
in
this
garden
and
it
was
easy
to
find
there
a
suitable
spot
for
prayer
and
meditation
it
was
to
the
wildest
part
that
jesus
went
to
pray
it
was
about
nine
when
jesus
reached
gethsemani
with
his
disciples
the
moon
had
risen
and
already
gave
light
in
the
sky
although
the
earth
was
still
dark
jesus
was
most
sorrowful
and
told
his
apostles
that
danger
was
at
hand
the
disciples
felt
uneasy
and
he
told
eight
of
those
who
were
following
him
to
remain
in
the
garden
of
gethsemani
whilst
he
went
on
to
pray
he
took
with
him
peter
james
and
john
and
going
on
a
little
further
entered
into
the
garden
of
olives
no
words
can
describe
the
sorrow
which
then
oppressed
his
soul
for
the
time
of
trial
was
near
john
asked
him
how
it
was
that
he
who
had
hitherto
always
consoled
them
would
now
be
so
dejected
soul
is
sorrowful
even
unto
death
was
his
reply
and
he
beheld
sufferings
and
temptations
surrounding
him
on
all
sides
and
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
under
the
forms
of
frightful
figures
borne
on
clouds
then
it
was
that
he
said
to
the
three
apostles
you
here
and
watch
with
me
pray
lest
ye
enter
into
temptation
jesus
went
a
few
steps
to
the
left
down
a
hill
and
concealed
himself
beneath
a
rock
in
a
grotto
about
six
feet
deep
while
the
apostles
remained
in
a
species
of
hollow
above
the
earth
sank
gradually
the
further
you
entered
this
grotto
and
the
plants
which
were
hanging
from
the
rock
screened
its
interior
like
a
curtain
from
persons
outside
when
jesus
left
his
disciples
i
saw
a
number
of
frightful
figures
surrounding
him
in
an
circle
his
sorrow
and
anguish
of
soul
continued
to
increase
and
he
was
trembling
all
over
when
he
entered
the
grotto
to
pray
like
a
wayworn
traveller
hurriedly
seeking
shelter
from
a
sudden
storm
but
the
awful
visions
pursued
him
even
there
and
became
more
and
more
clear
and
distinct
alas
this
small
cavern
appeared
to
contain
the
awful
picture
of
all
the
sins
which
had
been
or
were
to
be
committed
from
the
fall
of
adam
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
of
the
punishment
which
they
deserved
it
was
here
on
mount
olivet
that
adam
and
eve
took
refuge
when
drive
out
of
paradise
to
wander
homeless
on
earth
and
they
had
wept
and
bewailed
themselves
in
this
very
grotto
i
felt
that
jesus
in
delivering
himself
up
to
divine
justice
in
satisfaction
for
the
sins
of
the
world
caused
his
divinity
to
return
in
some
sort
into
the
bosom
of
the
holy
trinity
concentrated
himself
so
to
speak
in
his
pure
loving
and
innocent
humanity
and
strong
only
in
his
ineffable
love
gave
it
up
to
anguish
and
suffering
he
fell
on
his
face
overwhelmed
with
unspeakable
sorrow
and
all
the
sins
of
the
world
displayed
themselves
before
him
under
countless
forms
and
in
all
their
real
deformity
he
took
them
all
upon
himself
and
in
his
prayer
offered
his
own
adorable
person
to
the
justice
of
his
heavenly
father
in
payment
for
so
awful
a
debt
but
satan
who
was
enthroned
amid
all
these
horrors
and
even
filled
with
diabolical
joy
at
the
sight
of
them
let
loose
his
fury
against
jesus
and
displayed
before
the
eyes
of
his
soul
increasingly
awful
visions
at
the
same
time
addressing
his
adorable
humanity
in
words
such
as
these
thou
even
this
sin
upon
thyself
art
thou
willing
to
bear
its
penalty
art
thou
prepared
to
satisfy
for
all
these
sins
and
now
a
long
ray
of
light
like
a
luminous
path
in
the
air
descended
from
heaven
it
was
a
procession
of
angels
who
came
up
to
jesus
and
strengthened
and
him
the
remainder
of
the
grotto
was
filled
with
frightful
visions
of
our
crimes
jesus
took
them
all
upon
himself
but
that
adorable
heart
which
was
so
filled
with
the
most
perfect
love
for
god
and
man
was
flooded
with
anguish
and
overwhelmed
beneath
the
weight
of
so
many
abominable
crimes
when
this
huge
mass
of
iniquities
like
the
waves
of
a
fathomless
ocean
has
passed
over
his
soul
satan
brought
forward
innumerable
temptations
as
he
had
formerly
done
in
the
desert
even
daring
to
adduce
various
accusations
against
him
takest
thou
all
these
things
upon
thyself
he
exclaimed
who
art
not
unspotted
thyself
then
he
laid
to
the
charge
of
our
lord
with
infernal
impudence
a
host
of
imaginary
crimes
he
reproached
him
with
the
faults
of
his
disciples
the
scandals
which
they
had
caused
and
the
disturbances
which
he
had
occasioned
in
the
world
by
giving
up
ancient
customs
no
pharisee
however
wily
and
severe
could
have
surpassed
satan
on
this
occasion
he
reproached
jesus
with
having
been
the
cause
of
the
massacre
of
the
innocents
as
well
as
of
the
sufferings
of
his
parents
in
egypt
with
not
having
saved
john
the
baptist
from
death
with
having
brought
disunion
into
families
protected
men
of
despicable
character
refused
to
cure
various
sick
persons
injured
the
inhabitants
of
gergesa
by
permitting
men
possessed
by
the
devil
to
overturn
their
and
demons
to
make
swine
cast
themselves
into
the
sea
with
having
deserted
his
family
and
squandered
the
property
of
others
in
one
word
satan
in
the
hopes
of
causing
jesus
to
waver
suggested
to
him
every
thought
by
which
he
would
have
tempted
at
the
hour
of
death
an
ordinary
mortal
who
might
have
performed
all
these
actions
without
a
superhuman
intention
for
it
was
hidden
from
him
that
jesus
was
the
son
of
god
and
he
tempted
him
only
as
the
most
just
of
men
our
divine
saviour
permitted
his
humanity
thus
to
preponderate
over
his
divinity
for
he
was
pleased
to
endure
even
those
temptations
with
which
holy
souls
are
assailed
at
the
hour
of
death
concerning
the
merit
of
their
good
works
that
he
might
drink
the
chalice
of
suffering
even
to
the
dregs
he
permitted
the
evil
spirit
to
tempt
his
sacred
humanity
as
he
would
have
tempted
a
man
who
should
wish
to
attribute
to
his
good
works
some
special
value
in
themselves
over
and
above
what
they
might
have
by
their
union
with
the
merits
of
our
saviour
there
was
not
an
action
out
of
which
he
did
not
contrive
to
frame
some
accusation
and
he
reproached
jesus
among
other
things
with
having
spent
the
price
of
the
property
of
mary
magdalen
at
magdalum
which
he
had
received
from
lazarus
among
the
sins
of
the
world
which
jesus
took
upon
himself
i
saw
also
my
own
and
a
stream
in
which
i
distinctly
beheld
each
of
my
faults
appeared
to
flow
towards
me
from
out
of
the
temptations
with
which
he
was
encircled
during
this
time
my
eyes
were
fixed
upon
my
heavenly
spouse
with
him
i
wept
and
prayed
and
with
him
i
turned
towards
the
consoling
angels
ah
truly
did
our
dear
lord
writhe
like
a
worm
beneath
the
weight
of
his
anguish
and
sufferings
whilst
satan
was
pouring
forth
his
accusations
against
jesus
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
could
restrain
my
indignation
but
when
he
spoke
of
the
sale
of
magdalen
property
i
could
no
longer
keep
silence
and
exclaimed
canst
thou
reproach
him
with
the
sale
of
this
property
as
with
a
crime
did
i
not
myself
see
our
lord
spend
the
sum
which
was
given
him
by
lazarus
in
works
of
mercy
and
deliver
debtors
imprisoned
at
thirza
at
first
jesus
looked
calm
as
he
kneeled
down
and
prayed
but
after
a
time
his
soul
became
terrified
at
the
sight
of
the
innumerable
crimes
of
men
and
of
their
ingratitude
towards
god
and
his
anguish
was
so
great
that
the
trembled
and
shuddered
as
he
exclaimed
if
it
is
possible
let
this
chalice
pass
from
me
father
all
things
are
possible
to
thee
remove
this
chalice
from
me
but
the
next
moment
he
added
not
my
will
but
thine
be
done
his
will
and
that
of
his
father
were
one
but
now
that
his
love
had
ordained
that
he
should
be
left
to
all
the
weakness
of
his
human
nature
he
trembled
at
the
prospect
of
death
i
saw
the
cavern
in
which
he
was
kneeling
filled
with
frightful
figures
i
saw
all
the
sins
wickedness
vices
and
ingratitude
of
mankind
torturing
and
crushing
him
to
the
earth
the
horror
of
death
and
terror
which
he
felt
as
man
at
the
sight
of
the
expiatory
sufferings
about
to
come
upon
him
surrounded
and
assailed
his
divine
person
under
the
forms
of
hideous
spectres
he
fell
from
side
to
side
clasping
his
hands
his
body
was
covered
with
a
cold
sweat
and
he
trembled
and
shuddered
he
then
arose
but
his
knees
were
shaking
and
apparently
scarcely
able
to
support
him
his
countenance
was
pale
and
quite
altered
in
appearance
his
lips
white
and
his
hair
standing
on
end
it
was
about
ten
when
he
arose
from
his
knees
and
bathed
in
a
cold
sweat
directed
his
trembling
weak
footsteps
towards
his
three
apostles
with
difficulty
did
he
ascend
the
left
side
of
the
cavern
and
reach
a
spot
where
the
ground
was
level
and
where
they
were
sleeping
exhausted
with
fatigue
sorrow
and
anxiety
he
came
to
them
like
a
man
overwhelmed
with
bitter
sorrow
whom
terror
urges
to
seek
his
friends
but
like
also
to
a
good
shepherd
who
when
warned
of
the
approach
of
danger
hastens
to
visit
his
flock
the
safety
of
which
is
threatened
for
he
well
knew
that
they
also
were
being
tried
by
suffering
and
temptation
the
terrible
visions
never
left
him
even
while
he
was
thus
seeking
his
disciples
when
he
found
that
they
were
asleep
he
clasped
his
hands
and
fell
down
on
his
knees
beside
them
overcome
with
sorrow
and
anxiety
and
said
sleepest
thou
they
awoke
and
raised
him
up
and
he
in
his
desolation
of
spirit
said
to
them
could
you
not
watch
one
hour
with
me
when
they
looked
at
him
and
saw
him
pale
and
exhausted
scarcely
able
to
support
himself
bathed
in
sweat
trembling
and
shuddering
when
they
heard
how
changed
and
almost
inaudible
his
voice
had
become
they
did
not
know
what
to
think
and
had
he
not
been
still
surrounded
by
a
halo
of
light
they
would
never
have
recognised
him
as
jesus
john
said
to
him
what
has
befallen
thee
must
i
call
the
other
disciples
ought
we
to
take
to
flight
jesus
answered
him
i
to
live
teach
and
perform
miracles
for
years
longer
that
would
not
suffice
for
the
accomplishment
of
what
must
be
fulfilled
before
this
time
tomorrow
call
not
the
eight
i
did
not
bring
them
hither
because
they
could
not
see
me
thus
agonising
without
being
scandalised
they
would
yield
to
temptation
forget
much
of
the
past
and
lose
their
confidence
in
me
but
you
who
have
seen
the
son
of
man
transfigured
may
also
see
him
under
a
cloud
and
in
dereliction
of
spirit
nevertheless
watch
and
pray
lest
ye
fall
into
temptation
for
the
spirit
indeed
is
willing
but
the
flesh
is
weak
by
these
words
he
sought
at
once
to
encourage
them
to
persevere
and
to
make
known
to
them
the
combat
which
his
human
nature
was
sustaining
against
death
together
with
the
cause
of
his
weakness
in
his
overwhelming
sorrow
he
remained
with
them
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
spoke
to
them
again
he
then
returned
to
the
grotto
his
mental
sufferings
being
still
on
the
increase
while
his
disciples
on
their
part
stretched
forth
their
hands
towards
him
wept
and
embraced
each
other
asking
can
it
be
what
is
happening
to
him
he
appears
to
be
in
a
state
of
complete
desolation
after
this
they
covered
their
heads
and
began
to
pray
sorrowfully
and
anxiously
about
an
hour
and
a
half
had
passed
since
jesus
entered
the
garden
of
olives
it
is
true
that
scripture
tells
us
he
said
you
not
watch
one
hour
with
me
but
his
words
should
not
be
taken
literally
nor
according
to
our
way
of
counting
time
the
three
apostles
who
were
with
jesus
had
prayed
at
first
but
then
they
had
fallen
asleep
for
temptation
had
come
upon
them
by
reason
of
their
want
of
trust
in
god
the
other
eight
who
had
remained
outside
the
garden
did
not
sleep
for
our
lord
last
words
so
expressive
of
suffering
and
sadness
had
filled
their
hearts
with
sinister
forebodings
and
they
wandered
about
mount
olivet
trying
to
find
some
place
of
refuge
in
case
of
danger
the
town
of
jerusalem
was
very
quiet
the
jews
were
in
their
houses
engaged
in
preparing
for
the
feast
but
i
saw
here
and
there
some
of
the
friends
and
disciples
of
jesus
walking
to
and
fro
with
anxious
countenances
conversing
earnestly
together
and
evidently
expecting
some
great
event
the
mother
of
our
lord
magdalen
martha
mary
of
cleophas
mary
salome
and
salome
had
gone
from
the
to
the
house
of
mary
the
mother
of
mark
mary
was
alarmed
at
the
reports
which
were
spreading
and
wished
to
return
to
the
town
with
her
friends
in
order
to
hear
something
of
jesus
lazarus
nicodemus
joseph
of
arimathea
and
some
relations
from
hebron
came
to
see
and
endeavour
to
tranquillise
her
for
as
they
were
aware
either
from
their
own
knowledge
or
from
what
the
disciples
had
told
them
of
the
mournful
predictions
which
jesus
had
made
in
the
they
had
made
inquiries
of
some
pharisees
of
their
acquaintance
and
had
not
been
able
to
hear
that
any
conspiracy
was
on
foot
for
the
time
against
our
lord
being
utterly
ignorant
of
the
treason
of
judas
they
assured
mary
that
the
danger
could
not
yet
be
very
great
and
that
the
enemies
of
jesus
would
not
make
any
attempt
upon
his
person
at
least
until
the
festival
was
over
mary
told
them
how
restless
and
disturbed
in
mind
judas
had
latterly
appeared
and
how
abruptly
he
had
left
the
she
felt
no
doubt
of
his
having
gone
to
betray
our
lord
for
she
had
often
warned
him
that
he
was
a
son
of
perdition
the
holy
women
then
returned
to
the
house
of
mary
the
mother
of
mark
when
jesus
unrelieved
of
all
the
weight
of
his
sufferings
returned
to
the
grotto
he
fell
prostrate
with
his
face
on
the
ground
and
his
arms
extended
and
prayed
to
his
eternal
father
but
his
soul
had
to
sustain
a
second
interior
combat
which
lasted
of
an
hour
angels
came
and
showed
him
in
a
series
of
visions
all
the
sufferings
that
he
was
to
endure
in
order
to
expiate
sin
how
great
was
the
beauty
of
man
the
image
of
god
before
the
fall
and
how
that
beauty
was
changed
and
obliterated
when
sin
entered
the
world
he
beheld
how
all
sins
originated
in
that
of
adam
the
signification
and
essence
of
concupiscence
its
terrible
effect
on
the
powers
of
the
soul
and
likewise
the
signification
and
essence
of
all
the
sufferings
entailed
by
concupiscence
they
showed
him
the
satisfaction
which
he
would
have
to
offer
to
divine
justice
and
how
it
would
consist
of
a
degree
of
suffering
in
his
soul
and
body
which
would
comprehend
all
the
sufferings
due
to
the
concupiscence
of
all
mankind
since
the
debt
of
the
whole
human
race
had
to
be
paid
by
that
humanity
which
alone
was
sinless
the
humanity
of
the
son
of
god
the
angels
showed
him
all
these
things
under
different
forms
and
i
felt
what
they
were
saying
although
i
heard
no
voice
no
tongue
can
describe
what
anguish
and
what
horror
overwhelmed
the
soul
of
jesus
at
the
sight
of
so
terrible
an
expiation
his
sufferings
were
so
great
indeed
that
a
bloody
sweat
issued
forth
from
all
the
pores
of
this
sacred
body
whilst
the
adorable
humanity
of
christ
was
thus
crushed
to
the
earth
beneath
this
awful
weight
of
suffering
the
angels
appeared
filled
with
compassion
there
was
a
pause
and
i
perceived
that
they
were
earnestly
desiring
to
console
him
and
praying
to
that
effect
before
the
throne
of
god
for
one
instant
there
appeared
to
be
as
it
were
a
struggle
between
the
mercy
and
justice
of
god
and
that
love
which
was
sacrificing
itself
i
was
permitted
to
see
an
image
of
god
not
as
before
seated
on
a
throne
but
under
a
luminous
form
i
beheld
the
divine
nature
of
the
son
in
the
person
of
the
father
and
as
it
were
withdrawn
in
his
bosom
the
person
of
the
holy
ghost
proceeded
from
the
father
and
the
son
it
was
so
to
speak
between
them
and
yet
the
whole
formed
only
one
god
but
these
things
are
indescribable
all
this
was
more
an
inward
perception
than
a
vision
under
distinct
forms
and
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
divine
will
of
our
lord
withdrew
in
some
sort
into
the
eternal
father
in
order
to
permit
all
those
sufferings
which
his
human
will
besought
his
father
to
spare
him
to
weigh
upon
his
humanity
alone
i
saw
this
at
the
time
when
the
angels
filled
with
compassion
were
desiring
to
console
jesus
who
in
fact
was
slightly
relieved
at
that
moment
then
all
disappeared
and
the
angels
retired
from
our
lord
whose
soul
was
about
to
sustain
fresh
assaults
when
our
redeemer
on
mount
olivet
was
pleased
to
experience
and
overcome
that
violent
repugnance
of
human
nature
to
suffering
and
death
which
constitutes
a
portion
of
all
sufferings
the
tempter
was
permitted
to
do
to
him
what
he
does
to
all
men
who
desire
to
sacrifice
themselves
in
a
holy
cause
in
the
first
portion
of
the
agony
satan
displayed
before
the
eyes
of
our
lord
the
enormity
of
that
debt
of
sin
which
he
was
going
to
pay
and
was
even
bold
and
malicious
enough
to
seek
faults
in
the
very
works
of
our
saviour
himself
in
the
second
agony
jesus
beheld
to
its
fullest
extent
and
in
all
its
bitterness
the
expiatory
suffering
which
would
be
required
to
satisfy
divine
justice
this
was
displayed
to
him
by
angels
for
it
belongs
not
to
satan
to
show
that
expiation
is
possible
and
the
father
of
lies
and
despair
never
exhibits
the
works
of
divine
mercy
before
men
jesus
having
victoriously
resisted
all
these
assaults
by
his
entire
and
absolute
submission
to
the
will
of
his
heavenly
father
a
succession
of
new
and
terrifying
visions
were
presented
before
his
eyes
and
that
feeling
of
doubt
and
anxiety
which
a
man
on
the
point
of
making
some
great
sacrifice
always
experiences
arose
in
the
soul
of
our
lord
as
he
asked
himself
the
tremendous
question
what
good
will
result
from
this
sacrifice
then
a
most
awful
picture
of
the
future
was
displayed
before
his
eyes
and
overwhelmed
his
tender
heart
with
anguish
when
god
had
created
the
first
adam
he
cast
a
deep
sleep
upon
him
opened
his
side
and
took
one
of
his
ribs
of
which
he
made
eve
his
wife
and
the
mother
of
all
the
living
then
he
brought
her
to
adam
who
exclaimed
now
is
bone
of
my
bones
and
flesh
of
my
flesh
wherefore
a
man
shall
leave
father
and
mother
and
shall
cleave
to
his
wife
and
they
shall
be
two
in
one
flesh
that
was
the
marriage
of
which
it
is
written
is
a
great
sacrament
i
speak
in
christ
and
in
the
church
jesus
christ
the
second
adam
was
pleased
also
to
let
sleep
come
upon
him
the
sleep
of
death
on
the
cross
and
he
was
also
pleased
to
let
his
side
be
opened
in
order
that
the
second
eve
his
virgin
spouse
the
church
the
mother
of
all
the
living
might
be
formed
from
it
it
was
his
will
to
give
her
the
blood
of
redemption
the
water
of
purification
and
his
spirit
the
three
which
render
testimony
on
earth
and
to
bestow
upon
her
also
the
holy
sacraments
in
order
that
she
might
be
pure
holy
and
undefiled
he
was
to
be
her
head
and
we
were
to
be
her
members
under
submission
to
the
head
the
bone
of
his
bones
and
the
flesh
of
his
flesh
in
taking
human
nature
that
he
might
suffer
death
for
us
he
had
also
left
his
eternal
father
to
cleave
to
his
spouse
the
church
and
he
became
one
flesh
with
her
by
feeding
her
with
the
adorable
sacrament
of
the
altar
in
which
he
unites
himself
unceasingly
with
us
he
had
been
pleased
to
remain
on
earth
with
his
church
until
we
shall
all
be
united
together
by
him
within
her
fold
and
he
has
said
gates
of
hell
shall
never
prevail
against
her
to
satisfy
his
unspeakable
love
for
sinners
our
lord
had
become
man
and
a
brother
of
these
same
sinners
that
so
he
might
take
upon
himself
the
punishment
due
to
all
their
crimes
he
had
contemplated
with
deep
sorrow
the
greatness
of
this
debt
and
the
unspeakable
sufferings
by
which
it
was
to
be
acquitted
yet
he
had
most
joyfully
given
himself
up
to
the
will
of
his
heavenly
father
as
a
victim
of
expiation
now
however
he
beheld
all
the
future
sufferings
combats
and
wounds
of
his
heavenly
spouse
in
one
word
he
beheld
the
ingratitude
of
men
the
soul
of
jesus
beheld
all
the
future
sufferings
of
his
apostles
disciples
and
friends
after
which
he
saw
the
primitive
church
numbering
but
few
souls
in
her
fold
at
first
and
then
in
proportion
as
her
numbers
increased
disturbed
by
heresies
and
schisms
breaking
out
among
her
children
who
repeated
the
sin
of
adam
by
pride
and
disobedience
he
saw
the
tepidity
malice
and
corruption
of
an
infinite
number
of
christians
the
lies
and
deceptions
of
proud
teachers
all
the
sacrileges
of
wicked
priests
the
fatal
consequences
of
each
sin
and
the
abomination
of
desolation
in
the
kingdom
of
god
in
the
sanctuary
of
those
ungrateful
human
beings
whom
he
was
about
to
redeem
with
his
blood
at
the
cost
of
unspeakable
sufferings
the
scandals
of
all
ages
down
to
the
present
day
and
even
to
the
end
of
the
world
every
species
of
error
deception
mad
fanaticism
obstinacy
and
malice
were
displayed
before
his
eyes
and
he
beheld
as
it
were
floating
before
him
all
the
apostates
heresiarchs
and
pretended
reformers
who
deceive
men
by
an
appearance
of
sanctity
the
corrupters
and
the
corrupted
of
all
ages
outraged
and
tormented
him
for
not
having
been
crucified
after
their
fashion
or
for
not
having
suffered
precisely
as
they
settled
or
imagined
he
should
have
done
they
vied
with
each
other
in
tearing
the
seamless
robe
of
his
church
many
illtreated
insulted
and
denied
him
and
many
turned
contemptuously
away
shaking
their
heads
at
him
avoiding
his
compassionate
embrace
and
hurrying
on
to
the
abyss
where
they
were
finally
swallowed
up
he
saw
countless
numbers
of
other
men
who
did
not
dare
openly
to
deny
him
but
who
passed
on
in
disgust
at
the
sight
of
the
wounds
of
his
church
as
the
levite
passed
by
the
poor
man
who
had
fallen
among
robbers
like
unto
cowardly
and
faithless
children
who
desert
their
mother
in
the
middle
of
the
night
at
the
sight
of
the
thieves
and
robbers
to
whom
their
negligence
or
their
malice
has
opened
the
door
they
fled
from
his
wounded
spouse
he
beheld
all
these
men
sometimes
separated
from
the
true
vine
and
taking
their
rest
amid
the
wild
fruit
trees
sometimes
like
lost
sheep
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
wolves
led
by
base
hirelings
into
bad
pasturages
and
refusing
to
enter
the
fold
of
the
good
shepherd
who
gave
his
life
for
his
sheep
they
were
wandering
homeless
in
the
desert
in
the
midst
of
the
sand
blown
about
by
the
wind
and
were
obstinately
determined
not
to
see
his
city
placed
upon
a
hill
which
could
not
be
hidden
the
house
of
his
spouse
his
church
built
upon
a
rock
and
with
which
he
had
promised
to
remain
to
the
end
of
ages
they
built
upon
the
sand
wretched
tenements
which
they
were
continually
pulling
down
and
rebuilding
but
in
which
there
was
neither
altar
nor
sacrifice
they
had
weathercocks
on
their
roofs
and
their
doctrines
changed
with
the
wind
consequently
they
were
for
ever
in
opposition
one
with
the
other
they
never
could
come
to
a
mutual
understanding
and
were
forever
unsettled
often
destroying
their
own
dwellings
and
hurling
the
fragments
against
the
of
the
church
which
always
remained
unshaken
as
there
was
nothing
but
darkness
in
the
dwelling
of
these
men
many
among
them
instead
of
directing
their
steps
towards
the
candle
placed
on
the
candlestick
in
the
house
of
the
spouse
of
christ
wandered
with
closed
eyes
around
the
gardens
of
the
church
sustaining
life
only
by
inhaling
the
sweet
odours
which
were
diffused
from
them
far
and
near
stretching
forth
their
hands
towards
shadowy
idols
and
following
wandering
stars
which
led
them
to
wells
where
there
was
no
water
even
when
on
the
very
brink
of
the
precipice
they
refused
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
the
spouse
calling
them
and
though
dying
with
hunger
derided
insulted
and
mocked
at
those
servants
and
messengers
who
were
sent
to
invite
them
to
the
nuptial
feast
they
obstinately
refused
to
enter
the
garden
because
they
feared
the
thorns
of
the
hedge
although
they
had
neither
wheat
with
which
to
satisfy
their
hunger
nor
wine
to
quench
their
thirst
but
were
simply
intoxicated
with
pride
and
and
being
blinded
by
their
own
false
lights
persisted
in
asserting
that
the
church
of
the
word
made
flesh
was
invisible
jesus
beheld
them
all
he
wept
over
them
and
was
pleased
to
suffer
for
all
those
who
do
not
see
him
and
who
will
not
carry
their
crosses
after
him
in
his
city
built
upon
a
hill
his
church
founded
upon
a
rock
to
which
he
has
given
himself
in
the
holy
eucharist
and
against
which
the
gates
of
hell
will
never
prevail
bearing
a
prominent
place
in
these
mournful
visions
which
were
beheld
by
the
soul
of
jesus
i
saw
satan
who
dragged
away
and
strangled
a
multitude
of
men
redeemed
by
the
blood
of
christ
and
sanctified
by
the
unction
of
his
sacrament
our
divine
saviour
beheld
with
bitterest
anguish
the
ingratitude
and
corruption
of
the
christians
of
the
first
and
of
all
succeeding
ages
even
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
during
the
whole
of
this
time
the
voice
of
the
tempter
was
incessantly
repeating
thou
resolve
to
suffer
for
such
ungrateful
reprobates
while
the
various
apparitions
succeeded
each
other
with
intense
rapidity
and
so
violently
weighed
down
and
crushed
the
soul
of
jesus
that
his
sacred
humanity
was
overwhelmed
with
unspeakable
anguish
jesus
the
anointed
of
the
lord
the
son
of
man
struggled
and
writhed
as
he
fell
on
his
knees
with
clasped
hands
as
it
were
annihilated
beneath
the
weight
of
his
suffering
so
violent
was
the
struggle
which
then
took
place
between
his
human
will
and
his
repugnance
to
suffer
so
much
for
such
an
ungrateful
race
that
from
every
pore
of
his
sacred
body
there
burst
forth
large
drops
of
blood
which
fell
trickling
on
to
the
ground
in
his
bitter
agony
he
looked
around
as
though
seeking
help
and
appeared
to
take
heaven
earth
and
the
stars
of
the
firmament
to
witness
of
his
sufferings
jesus
in
his
anguish
of
spirit
raised
his
voice
and
gave
utterance
to
several
cries
of
pain
the
three
apostles
awoke
listened
and
were
desirous
of
approaching
him
but
peter
detained
james
and
john
saying
you
here
i
will
join
him
then
i
saw
peter
hastily
run
forward
and
enter
the
grotto
he
exclaimed
has
befallen
thee
but
at
the
sight
of
jesus
thus
bathed
in
his
own
blood
and
sinking
to
the
ground
beneath
the
weight
of
mortal
fear
and
anguish
he
drew
back
and
paused
for
a
moment
overcome
with
terror
jesus
made
him
no
answer
and
appeared
unconscious
of
his
presence
peter
returned
to
the
other
two
and
told
them
that
the
lord
had
not
answered
him
except
by
groans
and
sighs
they
became
more
and
more
sorrowful
after
this
covered
their
heads
and
sat
down
to
weep
and
pray
i
then
returned
to
my
heavenly
spouse
in
his
most
bitter
agony
the
frightful
visions
of
the
future
ingratitude
of
the
men
whose
debt
to
divine
justice
he
was
taking
upon
himself
continued
to
become
more
and
more
vivid
and
tremendous
several
times
i
heard
him
exclaim
my
father
can
i
possibly
suffer
for
so
ungrateful
a
race
o
my
father
if
this
chalice
may
not
pass
from
me
but
i
must
drink
it
thy
will
be
done
amid
all
these
apparitions
satan
held
a
conspicuous
place
under
various
forms
which
represented
different
species
of
sins
sometimes
he
appeared
under
the
form
of
a
gigantic
black
figure
sometimes
under
those
of
a
tiger
a
fox
a
wolf
a
dragon
or
a
serpent
not
however
that
he
really
took
any
of
these
shapes
but
merely
some
one
of
their
characteristics
joined
with
other
hideous
forms
none
of
these
frightful
apparitions
entirely
resembled
any
creature
but
were
symbols
of
abomination
discord
contradiction
and
sin
in
one
word
were
demoniacal
to
the
fullest
extent
these
diabolical
figures
urged
on
dragged
and
tore
to
pieces
before
the
very
eyes
of
jesus
countless
numbers
of
those
men
for
whose
redemption
he
was
entering
upon
the
painful
way
of
the
cross
at
first
i
but
seldom
saw
the
serpent
soon
however
it
made
its
appearance
with
a
crown
upon
its
head
this
odious
reptile
was
of
gigantic
size
apparently
possessed
of
unbounded
strength
and
led
forward
countless
legions
of
the
enemies
of
jesus
in
every
age
and
of
every
nation
being
armed
with
all
kinds
of
destructive
weapons
they
sometimes
tore
one
another
in
pieces
and
then
renewed
their
attacks
upon
our
saviour
with
redoubled
rage
it
was
indeed
an
awful
sight
for
they
heaped
upon
him
the
most
fearful
outrages
cursing
striking
wounding
and
tearing
him
in
pieces
their
weapons
swords
and
spears
flew
about
in
the
air
crossing
and
recrossing
continually
in
all
directions
like
the
flails
of
threshers
in
an
immense
barn
and
the
rage
of
each
of
these
fiends
seemed
exclusively
directed
against
jesus
that
grain
of
heavenly
wheat
descended
to
the
earth
to
die
there
in
order
to
feed
men
eternally
with
the
bread
of
life
thus
exposed
to
the
fury
of
these
hellish
bands
some
of
which
appeared
to
me
wholly
composed
of
blind
men
jesus
was
as
much
wounded
and
bruised
as
if
their
blows
had
been
real
i
saw
him
stagger
from
side
to
side
sometimes
raising
himself
up
and
sometimes
falling
again
while
the
serpent
in
the
midst
of
the
crowds
whom
it
was
unceasingly
leading
forward
against
jesus
struck
the
ground
with
its
tail
and
tore
to
pieces
or
swallowed
all
whom
it
thus
knocked
to
the
ground
it
was
made
known
to
me
that
these
apparitions
were
all
those
persons
who
in
divers
ways
insult
and
outrage
jesus
really
and
truly
present
in
the
holy
sacrament
i
recognised
among
them
all
those
who
in
any
way
profane
the
blessed
eucharist
i
beheld
with
horror
all
the
outrages
thus
offered
to
our
lord
whether
by
neglect
irreverence
and
omission
of
what
was
due
to
him
by
open
contempt
abuse
and
the
most
awful
sacrileges
by
the
worship
of
worldly
idols
by
spiritual
darkness
and
false
knowledge
or
finally
by
error
incredulity
fanaticism
hatred
and
open
persecution
among
these
men
i
saw
many
who
were
blind
paralysed
deaf
and
dumb
and
even
children
blind
men
who
would
not
see
the
truth
paralytic
men
who
would
not
advance
according
to
its
directions
on
the
road
leading
to
eternal
live
deaf
men
who
refused
to
listen
to
its
warnings
and
threats
dumb
men
who
would
never
use
their
voices
in
its
defence
and
finally
children
who
were
led
astray
by
following
parents
and
teachers
filled
with
the
love
of
the
world
and
forgetfulness
of
god
who
were
fed
on
earthly
luxuries
drunk
with
false
wisdom
and
loathing
all
that
pertained
to
religion
among
the
latter
the
sight
of
whom
grieved
me
especially
because
jesus
so
loved
children
i
saw
many
irreverent
acolytes
who
did
not
honour
our
lord
in
the
holy
ceremonies
in
which
they
took
a
part
i
beheld
with
terror
that
many
priests
some
of
whom
even
fancied
themselves
full
of
faith
and
piety
also
outraged
jesus
in
the
adorable
sacrament
i
saw
many
who
believed
and
taught
the
doctrine
of
the
real
presence
but
did
not
sufficiently
take
it
to
heart
for
they
forgot
and
neglected
the
palace
throne
and
seat
of
the
living
god
that
is
to
say
the
church
the
altar
the
tabernacle
the
chalice
the
monstrance
the
vases
and
ornaments
in
one
word
all
that
is
used
in
his
worship
or
to
adorn
his
house
entire
neglect
reigned
everywhere
all
things
were
left
to
moulder
away
in
dust
and
filth
and
the
worship
of
god
was
if
not
inwardly
profaned
at
least
outwardly
dishonoured
nor
did
this
arise
from
real
poverty
but
from
indifference
sloth
preoccupation
of
mind
about
vain
earthly
concerns
and
often
also
from
egotism
and
spiritual
death
for
i
saw
neglect
of
this
kind
in
churches
the
pastors
and
congregations
of
which
were
rich
or
at
east
tolerably
well
off
i
saw
many
others
in
which
worldly
tasteless
unsuitable
ornaments
had
replaced
the
magnificent
adornments
of
a
more
pious
age
i
saw
that
often
the
poorest
of
men
were
better
lodged
in
their
cottages
than
the
master
of
heaven
and
earth
in
his
churches
ah
how
deeply
did
the
inhospitality
of
men
grieve
jesus
who
had
given
himself
to
them
to
be
their
food
truly
there
is
no
need
to
be
rich
in
order
to
receive
him
who
rewards
a
hundredfold
the
glass
of
cold
water
given
to
the
thirsty
but
how
shameful
is
not
our
conduct
when
in
giving
drink
to
the
divine
lord
who
thirst
for
our
souls
we
give
him
corrupted
water
in
a
filthy
glass
in
consequence
of
all
this
neglect
i
saw
the
weak
scandalised
the
adorable
sacrament
profaned
the
churches
deserted
and
the
priests
despised
this
state
of
impurity
and
negligence
extended
even
to
the
souls
of
the
faithful
who
left
the
tabernacle
of
their
hearts
unprepared
and
uncleansed
when
jesus
was
about
to
enter
them
exactly
the
same
as
they
left
his
tabernacle
on
the
altar
were
i
to
speak
for
an
entire
year
i
would
never
detail
all
the
insults
offered
to
jesus
in
the
adorable
sacrament
which
were
made
known
to
me
in
this
way
i
saw
their
authors
assault
jesus
in
bands
and
strike
him
with
different
arms
corresponding
to
their
various
offences
i
saw
irreverent
christians
of
all
ages
careless
or
sacrilegious
priests
crowds
of
tepid
and
unworthy
communicants
wicked
soldiers
profaning
the
sacred
vessels
and
servants
of
the
devil
making
use
of
the
holy
eucharist
in
the
frightful
mysteries
of
hellish
worship
among
these
bands
i
saw
a
great
number
of
theologians
who
had
been
drawn
into
heresy
by
their
sins
attacking
jesus
in
the
holy
sacrament
of
his
church
and
snatching
out
of
his
heart
by
their
seductive
words
and
promises
a
number
of
souls
for
whom
he
had
shed
his
blood
ah
it
was
indeed
an
awful
sight
for
i
saw
the
church
as
the
body
of
christ
and
all
these
bands
of
men
who
were
separating
themselves
from
the
church
mangled
and
tore
off
whole
pieces
of
his
living
flesh
alas
he
looked
at
them
in
the
most
touching
manner
and
lamented
that
they
should
thus
cause
their
own
eternal
loss
he
had
given
his
own
divine
self
to
us
for
our
food
in
the
holy
sacrament
in
order
to
unite
in
one
body
that
of
the
church
his
spouse
men
who
were
to
an
infinite
extent
divided
and
separated
from
each
other
and
now
he
beheld
himself
torn
and
rent
in
twain
in
that
very
body
for
his
principal
work
of
love
the
holy
communion
in
which
men
should
have
been
made
wholly
one
was
become
by
the
malice
of
false
teachers
the
subject
of
separation
i
beheld
whole
nations
thus
snatched
out
of
his
bosom
and
deprived
of
any
participation
in
the
treasure
of
graces
left
to
the
church
finally
i
saw
all
who
were
separated
from
the
church
plunged
into
the
depths
of
infidelity
superstition
heresy
and
false
worldly
philosophy
and
they
gave
vent
to
their
fierce
rage
by
joining
together
in
large
bodies
to
attack
the
church
being
urged
on
by
the
serpent
which
was
disporting
itself
in
the
midst
of
them
alas
it
was
as
though
jesus
himself
had
been
torn
in
a
thousand
pieces
so
great
was
my
horror
and
terror
that
my
heavenly
spouse
appeared
to
me
and
mercifully
placed
his
hand
upon
my
heart
saying
one
has
yet
seen
all
these
things
and
thy
heart
would
burst
with
sorrow
if
i
did
not
give
thee
strength
i
saw
the
blood
flowing
in
large
drops
down
the
pale
face
of
our
saviour
his
hair
matted
together
and
his
beard
bloody
and
entangled
after
the
vision
which
i
have
last
described
he
fled
so
to
speak
out
of
the
cave
and
returned
to
his
disciples
but
he
tottered
as
he
walked
his
appearance
was
that
of
a
man
covered
with
wounds
and
bending
beneath
a
heavy
burden
and
he
stumbled
at
every
step
when
he
came
up
to
the
three
apostles
they
were
not
lying
down
asleep
as
they
had
been
the
first
time
but
their
heads
were
covered
and
they
had
sunk
down
on
their
knees
in
an
attitude
often
assumed
by
the
people
of
that
country
when
in
sorrow
or
desiring
to
pray
they
had
fallen
asleep
overpowered
by
grief
and
fatigue
jesus
trembling
and
groaning
drew
nigh
to
them
and
they
awoke
but
when
by
the
light
of
the
moon
they
saw
him
standing
before
them
his
face
pale
and
bloody
and
his
hair
in
disorder
their
weary
eyes
did
not
at
the
first
moment
recognise
him
for
he
was
indescribably
changed
he
clasped
his
hands
together
upon
which
they
arose
and
lovingly
supported
him
in
their
arms
and
he
told
them
in
sorrowful
accents
that
the
next
day
he
should
be
put
to
death
that
in
one
hour
time
he
should
be
seized
led
before
a
tribunal
maltreated
outraged
scourged
and
finally
put
to
a
most
cruel
death
he
besought
them
to
console
his
mother
and
also
magdalen
they
made
no
reply
for
they
knew
not
what
to
say
so
greatly
had
his
appearance
and
language
alarmed
them
and
they
even
thought
his
mind
must
be
wandering
when
he
desired
to
return
to
the
grotto
he
had
not
strength
to
walk
i
saw
john
and
james
lead
him
back
and
return
when
he
had
entered
the
grotto
it
was
then
about
a
eleven
during
this
agony
of
jesus
i
saw
the
blessed
virgin
also
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
and
anguish
of
soul
in
the
house
of
mary
the
mother
of
mark
she
was
with
magdalen
and
mary
in
the
garden
belonging
to
the
house
and
almost
prostrate
from
grief
with
her
whole
body
bowed
down
as
she
knelt
she
fainted
several
times
for
she
beheld
in
spirit
different
portions
of
the
agony
of
jesus
she
had
sent
some
messengers
to
make
inquiries
concerning
him
but
her
deep
anxiety
would
not
suffer
her
to
await
their
return
and
she
went
with
magdalen
and
salome
as
far
as
the
valley
of
josaphat
she
walked
along
with
her
head
veiled
and
her
arms
frequently
stretched
forth
towards
mount
olivet
for
she
beheld
in
spirit
jesus
bathed
in
a
bloody
sweat
and
her
gestures
were
as
though
she
wished
with
her
extended
hands
to
wipe
the
face
of
her
son
i
saw
these
interior
movements
of
her
soul
towards
jesus
who
thought
of
her
and
turned
his
eyes
in
her
direction
as
if
to
seek
her
assistance
i
beheld
the
spiritual
communication
which
they
had
with
each
other
under
the
form
of
rays
passing
to
and
fro
between
them
our
divine
lord
thought
also
of
magdalen
was
touched
by
her
distress
and
therefore
recommended
his
apostles
to
console
her
for
he
knew
that
her
love
for
his
adorable
person
was
greater
than
that
felt
for
him
by
any
one
save
his
blessed
mother
and
he
foresaw
that
she
would
suffer
much
for
his
sake
and
never
offend
him
more
about
this
time
the
eight
apostles
returned
to
the
arbour
of
gethsemani
and
after
talking
together
for
some
time
ended
by
going
to
sleep
they
were
wavering
discouraged
and
sorely
tempted
they
had
each
been
seeking
for
a
place
of
refuge
in
case
of
danger
and
they
anxiously
asked
one
another
shall
we
do
when
they
have
put
him
to
death
we
have
left
all
to
follow
him
we
are
poor
and
the
offscouring
of
the
world
we
gave
ourselves
up
entirely
to
his
service
and
now
he
is
so
sorrowful
and
so
defected
himself
that
he
can
afford
us
no
consolation
the
other
disciples
had
at
first
wandered
about
in
various
directions
but
then
having
heard
something
concerning
the
awful
prophecies
which
jesus
had
made
they
had
nearly
all
retired
to
bethphage
i
saw
jesus
still
praying
in
the
grotto
struggling
against
the
repugnance
to
suffering
which
belonged
to
human
nature
and
abandoning
himself
wholly
to
the
will
of
this
eternal
father
here
the
abyss
opened
before
him
and
he
had
a
vision
of
the
first
part
of
limbo
he
saw
adam
and
eve
the
patriarchs
prophets
and
just
men
the
parents
of
his
mother
and
john
the
baptist
awaiting
his
arrival
in
the
lower
world
with
such
intense
longing
that
the
sight
strengthened
and
gave
fresh
courage
to
his
loving
heart
his
death
was
to
open
heaven
to
these
captives
his
death
was
to
deliver
them
out
of
that
prison
in
which
they
were
languishing
in
eager
hope
when
jesus
had
with
deep
emotion
looked
upon
these
saints
of
antiquity
angels
presented
to
him
all
the
bands
of
saints
of
future
ages
who
joining
their
labours
to
the
merits
of
his
passion
were
through
him
to
be
united
to
his
heavenly
father
most
beautiful
and
consoling
was
this
vision
in
which
he
beheld
the
salvation
and
sanctification
flowing
forth
in
ceaseless
streams
from
the
fountain
of
redemption
opened
by
his
death
the
apostles
disciples
virgins
and
holy
women
the
martyrs
confessors
hermits
popes
and
bishops
and
large
bands
of
religious
of
both
sexes
in
one
word
the
entire
army
of
the
blessed
appeared
before
him
all
bore
on
their
heads
triumphal
crowns
and
the
flowers
of
their
crowns
differed
in
form
in
colour
in
odour
and
in
perfection
according
to
the
difference
of
the
sufferings
labours
and
victories
which
had
procured
them
eternal
glory
their
whole
life
and
all
their
actions
merits
and
power
as
well
as
all
the
glory
of
their
triumph
came
solely
from
their
union
with
the
merits
of
jesus
christ
the
reciprocal
influence
exercised
by
these
saints
upon
each
other
and
the
manner
in
which
they
all
drank
from
one
sole
fountain
the
adorable
sacrament
and
the
passion
of
our
lord
formed
a
most
touching
and
wonderful
spectacle
nothing
about
them
was
devoid
of
deep
meaning
their
works
martyrdom
victories
appearance
and
dress
all
though
indescribably
varied
was
confused
together
in
infinite
harmony
and
unity
and
this
unity
in
diversity
was
produced
by
the
rays
of
one
single
sun
by
the
passion
of
the
lord
of
the
word
made
flesh
in
whom
was
life
the
light
of
men
which
shined
in
darkness
and
the
darkness
did
not
comprehend
it
the
army
of
the
future
saints
passed
before
the
soul
of
our
lord
which
was
thus
placed
between
the
desiring
patriarchs
and
the
triumphant
band
of
the
future
blessed
and
these
two
armies
joining
together
and
completing
one
another
so
to
speak
surrounded
the
loving
heart
of
our
saviour
as
with
a
crown
of
victory
this
most
affecting
and
consoling
spectacle
bestowed
a
degree
of
strength
and
comfort
upon
the
soul
of
jesus
ah
he
so
loved
his
brethren
and
creatures
that
to
accomplish
the
redemption
of
one
single
soul
he
would
have
accepted
with
joy
all
the
sufferings
to
which
he
was
now
devoting
himself
as
these
visions
referred
to
the
future
they
were
diffused
to
a
certain
height
in
the
air
but
these
consoling
visions
faded
away
and
the
angels
displayed
before
him
the
scenes
of
his
passion
quite
close
to
the
earth
because
it
was
near
at
hand
i
beheld
every
scene
distinctly
portrayed
from
the
kiss
of
judas
to
the
last
words
of
jesus
on
the
cross
and
i
saw
in
this
single
vision
all
that
i
see
in
my
meditations
on
the
passion
the
treason
of
judas
the
flight
of
the
disciples
the
insults
which
were
offered
our
lord
before
annas
and
caiphas
peter
denial
the
tribunal
of
pilate
herod
mockery
the
scourging
and
crowning
with
thorns
the
condemnation
to
death
the
carrying
of
the
cross
the
linen
cloth
presented
by
veronica
the
crucifixion
the
insults
of
the
pharisees
the
sorrows
of
mary
of
magdalen
and
of
john
the
wound
of
the
lance
in
his
side
after
death
in
one
word
every
part
of
the
passion
was
shown
to
him
in
the
minutest
detail
he
accepted
all
voluntarily
submitting
to
everything
for
the
love
of
man
he
saw
also
and
felt
the
sufferings
endured
at
that
moment
by
his
mother
whose
interior
union
with
his
agony
was
so
entire
that
she
had
fainted
in
the
arms
of
her
two
friends
when
the
visions
of
the
passion
were
concluded
jesus
fell
on
his
face
like
one
at
the
point
of
death
the
angels
disappeared
and
the
bloody
sweat
became
more
copious
so
that
i
saw
it
had
soaked
his
garment
entire
darkness
reigned
in
the
cavern
when
i
beheld
an
angel
descent
to
jesus
this
angel
was
of
higher
stature
than
any
whom
i
had
before
beheld
and
his
form
was
also
more
distinct
and
more
resembling
that
of
a
man
he
was
clothed
like
a
priest
in
a
long
floating
garment
and
bore
before
him
in
his
hands
a
small
vase
in
shape
resembling
the
chalice
used
at
the
last
supper
at
the
top
of
this
chalice
there
was
a
small
oval
body
about
the
size
of
a
bean
and
which
diffused
a
reddish
light
the
angel
without
touching
the
earth
with
his
feet
stretched
forth
his
right
hand
to
jesus
who
arose
when
he
placed
the
mysterious
food
in
his
mouth
and
gave
him
to
drink
from
the
luminous
chalice
then
he
disappeared
jesus
having
freely
accepted
the
chalice
of
his
sufferings
and
received
new
strength
remained
some
minutes
longer
in
the
grotto
absorbed
in
calm
meditation
and
returning
thanks
to
his
heavenly
father
he
was
still
in
deep
affliction
of
spirit
but
supernaturally
comforted
to
such
a
degree
as
to
be
able
to
go
to
his
disciples
without
tottering
as
he
walked
or
bending
beneath
the
weight
of
his
sufferings
his
countenance
was
still
pale
and
altered
but
his
step
was
firm
and
determined
he
had
wiped
his
face
with
a
linen
cloth
and
rearranged
his
hair
which
hung
about
his
shoulders
matted
together
and
damp
with
blood
when
jesus
came
to
his
disciples
they
were
lying
as
before
against
the
wall
of
the
terrace
asleep
and
with
their
heads
covered
our
lord
told
them
that
then
was
not
the
time
for
sleep
but
that
they
should
arise
and
pray
the
hour
is
at
hand
and
the
son
of
man
shall
be
betrayed
into
the
hand
of
sinners
he
said
let
us
go
behold
he
is
at
hand
that
will
betray
me
it
were
better
for
him
if
that
man
had
not
been
born
the
apostles
arose
in
much
alarm
and
looked
round
with
anxiety
when
they
had
somewhat
recovered
themselves
peter
said
warmly
i
will
call
the
others
that
so
we
may
defend
thee
but
jesus
pointed
out
to
them
at
some
distance
in
the
valley
on
the
other
side
of
the
brook
of
cedron
a
band
of
armed
men
who
were
advancing
with
torches
and
he
said
that
one
of
their
number
had
betrayed
him
he
spoke
calmly
exhorted
them
to
console
his
mother
and
said
us
go
to
meet
them
i
shall
deliver
myself
up
without
resistance
into
the
hands
of
my
enemies
he
then
left
the
garden
of
olives
with
the
three
apostles
and
went
to
meet
the
archers
on
the
road
which
led
from
that
garden
to
gethsemani
when
the
blessed
virgin
under
the
care
of
magdalen
and
salome
recovered
her
senses
some
disciples
who
had
seen
the
soldiers
approaching
conducted
her
back
to
the
house
of
mary
the
mother
of
mark
the
archers
took
a
shorter
road
than
that
which
jesus
followed
when
he
left
the
the
grotto
in
which
jesus
had
this
day
prayed
was
not
the
one
where
he
usually
prayed
on
mount
olivet
he
commonly
went
to
a
cabin
at
a
greater
distance
off
where
one
day
after
having
cursed
the
barren
he
had
prayed
in
great
affliction
of
spirit
with
his
arms
stretched
out
and
leaning
against
a
rock
the
traces
of
his
body
and
hands
remained
impressed
on
the
stone
and
were
honoured
later
but
it
was
not
known
on
what
occasion
the
miracle
had
taken
place
i
have
several
times
seen
similar
impressions
left
upon
the
stone
either
by
the
prophets
of
the
old
testament
or
by
jesus
mary
or
some
of
the
apostles
and
i
have
also
seen
those
made
by
the
body
of
catherine
on
mount
sinai
these
impressions
do
not
seem
deep
but
resemble
what
would
be
made
upon
a
thick
piece
of
dough
if
a
person
leaned
his
hand
upon
it
chapter
ii
judas
and
his
band
judas
had
not
expected
that
his
treason
would
have
produced
such
fatal
results
he
had
been
anxious
to
obtain
the
promised
reward
and
to
please
the
pharisees
by
delivering
up
jesus
into
their
hands
but
he
had
never
calculated
on
things
going
so
far
or
thought
that
the
enemies
of
his
master
would
actually
bring
him
to
judgment
and
crucify
him
his
mind
was
engrossed
with
the
love
of
gain
alone
and
some
astute
pharisees
and
sadducees
with
whom
he
had
established
an
intercourse
had
constantly
urged
him
on
to
treason
by
flattering
him
he
was
sick
of
the
fatiguing
wandering
and
persecuted
life
which
the
apostles
led
for
several
months
past
he
had
continually
stolen
from
the
alms
which
were
consigned
to
his
care
and
his
avarice
grudging
the
expenses
incurred
by
magdalen
when
she
poured
the
precious
ointment
on
the
feet
of
our
lord
incited
him
to
the
commission
of
the
greatest
of
crimes
he
had
always
hoped
that
jesus
would
establish
a
temporal
kingdom
and
bestow
upon
him
some
brilliant
and
lucrative
post
in
it
but
finding
himself
disappointed
he
turned
his
thoughts
to
amassing
a
fortune
he
saw
that
sufferings
and
persecutions
were
on
the
increase
for
our
lord
and
his
followers
and
he
sought
to
make
friends
with
the
powerful
enemies
of
our
saviour
before
the
time
of
danger
for
the
saw
that
jesus
did
not
become
a
king
whereas
the
actual
dignity
and
power
of
the
high
priest
and
of
all
who
were
attached
to
his
service
made
a
very
strong
impression
upon
his
mind
he
began
to
enter
by
degrees
into
a
close
connection
with
their
agents
who
were
constantly
flattering
him
and
assuring
him
in
strong
terms
that
in
any
case
an
end
would
speedily
be
put
to
the
career
of
our
divine
lord
he
listened
more
and
more
eagerly
to
the
criminal
suggestions
of
his
corrupt
heart
and
he
had
done
nothing
during
the
last
few
days
but
go
backwards
and
forwards
in
order
to
induce
the
chief
priests
to
come
to
some
agreement
but
they
were
unwilling
to
act
at
once
and
treated
him
with
contempt
they
said
that
sufficient
time
would
not
intervene
before
the
festival
day
and
that
there
would
be
a
tumult
among
the
people
the
sanhedrin
alone
listened
to
his
proposals
with
some
degree
of
attention
after
judas
had
sacrilegiously
received
the
blessed
sacrament
satan
took
entire
possession
of
him
and
he
went
off
at
once
to
complete
his
crime
he
in
the
first
place
sought
those
persons
who
had
hitherto
flattered
and
entered
into
agreements
with
him
and
who
still
received
him
with
pretended
friendship
some
others
joined
the
party
and
among
the
number
annas
and
caiphas
but
the
latter
treated
him
with
considerable
pride
and
scorn
all
these
enemies
of
christ
were
extremely
undecided
and
far
from
feeling
any
confidence
of
success
because
they
mistrusted
judas
i
saw
the
empire
of
hell
divided
against
itself
satan
desired
the
crime
of
the
jews
and
earnestly
longed
for
the
death
of
jesus
the
converter
of
souls
the
holy
teacher
the
just
man
who
was
so
abhorrent
to
him
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
an
extraordinary
interior
fear
of
the
death
of
the
innocent
victim
who
would
not
conceal
himself
from
his
persecutors
i
saw
him
then
on
the
one
hand
stimulate
the
hatred
and
fury
of
the
enemies
of
jesus
and
on
the
other
insinuate
to
some
of
their
number
that
judas
was
a
wicked
despicable
character
and
that
the
sentence
could
not
be
pronounced
before
the
festival
or
a
sufficient
number
of
witnesses
against
jesus
be
gathered
together
everyone
proposed
something
different
and
some
questioned
judas
saying
we
be
able
to
take
him
has
he
not
armed
men
with
him
and
the
traitor
replied
he
is
alone
with
eleven
disciples
he
is
greatly
depressed
and
the
eleven
are
timid
men
he
told
them
that
now
or
never
was
the
time
to
get
possession
of
the
person
of
jesus
that
later
he
might
no
longer
have
it
in
his
power
to
give
our
lord
up
into
their
hands
and
that
perhaps
he
should
never
return
to
him
again
because
for
several
days
past
it
had
been
very
clear
that
the
other
disciples
and
jesus
himself
suspected
and
would
certainly
kill
him
if
he
returned
to
them
he
told
them
likewise
that
if
they
did
not
at
once
seize
the
person
of
jesus
he
would
make
his
escape
and
return
with
an
army
of
his
partisans
to
have
himself
proclaimed
king
these
threats
of
judas
produced
some
effect
his
proposals
were
acceded
to
and
he
received
the
price
of
this
treason
thirty
pieces
of
silver
these
pieces
were
oblong
with
holes
in
their
sides
strung
together
by
means
of
rings
in
a
kind
of
chain
and
bearing
certain
impressions
judas
could
not
help
being
conscious
that
they
regarded
him
with
contempt
and
distrust
for
their
language
and
gestures
betrayed
their
feelings
and
pride
suggested
to
him
to
give
back
the
money
as
an
offering
for
the
temple
in
order
to
make
them
suppose
his
intentions
to
have
been
just
and
disinterested
but
they
rejected
his
proposal
because
the
price
of
blood
could
not
be
offered
in
the
temple
judas
saw
how
much
they
despised
him
and
his
rage
was
excessive
he
had
not
expected
to
reap
the
bitter
fruits
of
his
treason
even
before
it
was
accomplished
but
he
had
gone
so
far
with
these
men
that
he
was
in
their
power
and
escape
was
no
longer
possible
they
watched
him
carefully
and
would
not
let
him
leave
their
presence
until
he
had
shown
them
exactly
what
steps
were
to
be
taken
in
order
to
secure
the
person
of
jesus
three
pharisees
accompanied
him
when
he
went
down
into
a
room
where
the
soldiers
of
the
temple
some
only
of
whom
were
jews
and
the
rest
of
various
nations
were
assembled
when
everything
was
settled
and
the
necessary
number
of
soldiers
gathered
together
judas
hastened
first
to
the
accompanied
by
a
servant
of
the
pharisees
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
jesus
had
left
as
they
would
have
seized
his
person
there
without
difficulty
if
once
they
had
secured
the
doors
he
agreed
to
send
them
a
messenger
with
the
required
information
a
short
time
before
when
judas
had
received
the
price
of
this
treason
a
pharisee
had
gone
out
and
sent
seven
slaves
to
fetch
wood
with
which
to
prepare
the
cross
for
our
saviour
in
case
he
should
be
judged
because
the
next
day
there
would
not
be
sufficient
time
on
account
of
the
commencement
of
the
paschal
festivity
they
procured
this
wood
from
a
spot
about
of
a
mile
distant
near
a
high
wall
where
there
was
a
great
quantity
of
other
wood
belonging
to
the
temple
and
dragged
it
to
a
square
situated
behind
the
tribunal
of
caiphas
the
principal
piece
of
the
cross
came
from
a
tree
formerly
growing
in
the
valley
of
josaphat
near
the
torrent
of
cedron
and
which
having
fallen
across
the
stream
had
been
used
as
a
sort
of
bridge
when
nehemias
hid
the
sacred
fire
and
the
holy
vessels
in
the
pool
of
bethsaida
it
had
been
thrown
over
the
spot
together
with
other
pieces
of
wood
then
later
taken
away
and
left
on
one
side
the
cross
was
prepared
in
a
very
peculiar
manner
either
with
the
object
of
deriding
the
royalty
of
jesus
or
from
what
men
might
term
chance
it
was
composed
of
five
pieces
of
wood
exclusive
of
the
inscription
i
saw
many
other
things
concerning
the
cross
and
the
meaning
of
different
circumstances
was
also
made
known
to
me
but
i
have
forgotten
all
that
judas
returned
and
said
that
jesus
was
no
longer
in
the
but
that
he
must
certainly
be
on
mount
olivet
in
the
spot
where
he
was
accustomed
to
pray
he
requested
that
only
a
small
number
of
men
might
be
sent
with
him
lest
the
disciples
who
were
on
the
watch
should
perceive
anything
and
raise
a
sedition
three
hundred
men
were
to
be
stationed
at
the
gates
and
in
the
streets
of
ophel
a
part
of
the
town
situated
to
the
south
of
the
temple
and
along
the
valley
of
millo
as
far
as
the
house
of
annas
on
the
top
of
mount
sion
in
order
to
be
ready
to
send
reinforcements
if
necessary
for
he
said
all
the
people
of
the
lower
class
of
ophel
were
partisans
of
jesus
the
traitor
likewise
bade
them
be
careful
lest
he
should
escape
them
since
he
by
mysterious
means
had
so
often
hidden
himself
in
the
mountain
and
made
himself
suddenly
invisible
to
those
around
he
recommended
them
besides
to
fasten
him
with
a
chain
and
make
use
of
certain
magical
forms
to
prevent
his
breaking
it
the
jews
listened
to
all
these
pieces
of
advice
with
scornful
indifference
and
replied
we
once
have
him
in
our
hands
we
will
take
care
not
to
let
him
go
judas
next
began
to
make
his
arrangements
with
those
who
were
to
accompany
him
he
wished
to
enter
the
garden
before
them
and
embrace
and
salute
jesus
as
if
he
were
returning
to
him
as
his
friend
and
disciple
and
then
for
the
soldiers
to
run
forward
and
seize
the
person
of
jesus
he
was
anxious
that
it
should
be
thought
they
had
come
there
by
chance
that
so
when
they
had
made
their
appearance
he
might
run
away
like
the
other
disciples
and
be
no
more
heard
of
he
likewise
thought
that
perhaps
a
tumult
would
ensue
that
the
apostles
might
defend
themselves
and
jesus
pass
through
the
midst
of
his
enemies
as
he
had
so
often
done
before
he
dwelt
upon
these
thoughts
especially
when
his
pride
was
hurt
by
the
disdainful
manner
of
the
jews
in
his
regard
but
he
did
not
repent
for
he
had
wholly
given
himself
up
to
satan
it
was
his
desire
also
that
the
soldiers
following
him
should
not
carry
chains
and
cords
and
his
accomplices
pretended
to
accede
to
all
his
wishes
although
in
reality
they
acted
with
him
as
with
a
traitor
who
was
not
to
be
trusted
but
to
be
cast
off
as
soon
as
he
had
done
what
was
wanted
the
soldiers
received
orders
to
keep
close
to
judas
watch
him
carefully
and
not
let
him
escape
until
jesus
was
seized
for
he
had
received
his
reward
and
it
was
feared
that
he
might
run
off
with
the
money
and
jesus
not
be
taken
after
all
or
another
be
taken
in
his
place
the
band
of
men
chosen
to
accompany
judas
was
composed
of
twenty
soldiers
selected
from
the
temple
guard
and
from
others
of
the
military
who
were
under
the
orders
of
annas
and
caiphas
they
were
dressed
very
much
like
the
roman
soldiers
had
morions
crested
metal
helmets
like
them
and
wore
hanging
straps
round
their
thighs
but
their
beards
were
long
whereas
the
roman
soldiers
at
jerusalem
had
whiskers
only
and
shaved
their
chins
and
upper
lips
they
all
had
swords
some
of
them
being
also
armed
with
spears
and
they
carried
sticks
with
lanterns
and
torches
but
when
they
set
off
they
only
lighted
one
it
had
at
first
been
intended
that
judas
should
be
accompanied
by
a
more
numerous
escort
but
he
drew
their
attention
to
the
fact
that
so
large
a
number
of
men
would
be
too
easily
seen
because
mount
olivet
commanded
a
view
of
the
whole
valley
most
of
the
soldiers
remained
therefore
at
ophel
and
sentinels
were
stationed
on
all
sides
to
put
down
any
attempt
which
might
be
made
to
release
jesus
judas
set
off
with
the
twenty
soldiers
but
he
was
followed
at
some
distance
by
four
archers
who
were
only
common
bailiffs
carrying
cords
and
chains
and
after
them
came
the
six
agents
with
whom
judas
had
been
in
communication
for
some
time
one
of
these
was
a
priest
and
a
confidant
of
annas
a
second
was
devoted
to
caiphas
the
third
and
fourth
were
pharisees
and
the
other
two
sadducees
and
herodians
these
six
men
were
courtiers
of
annas
and
caiphas
acting
in
the
capacity
of
spies
and
most
bitter
enemies
of
jesus
the
soldiers
remained
on
friendly
terms
with
judas
until
they
reached
the
spot
where
the
road
divides
the
garden
of
olives
from
the
garden
of
gethsemani
but
there
they
refused
to
allow
him
to
advance
alone
and
entirely
changed
their
manner
treating
him
with
much
insolence
and
harshness
chapter
iii
jesus
is
arrested
jesus
was
standing
with
his
three
apostles
on
the
road
between
gethsemani
and
the
garden
of
olives
when
judas
and
the
band
who
accompanied
him
made
their
appearance
a
warm
dispute
arose
between
judas
and
the
soldiers
because
he
wished
to
approach
first
and
speak
to
jesus
quietly
as
if
nothing
was
the
matter
and
then
for
them
to
come
up
and
seize
our
saviour
thus
letting
him
suppose
that
he
had
no
connection
with
the
affair
but
the
men
answered
rudely
so
friend
thou
shalt
not
escape
from
our
hands
until
we
have
the
galilean
safely
bound
and
seeing
the
eight
apostles
who
hastened
to
rejoin
jesus
when
they
heard
the
dispute
which
was
going
on
they
notwithstanding
the
opposition
of
judas
called
up
four
archers
whom
they
had
left
at
a
little
distance
to
assist
when
by
the
light
of
the
moon
jesus
and
the
three
apostles
first
saw
the
band
of
armed
men
peter
wished
to
repel
them
by
force
of
arms
and
said
the
other
eight
are
close
at
hand
let
us
attack
the
archers
but
jesus
bade
him
hold
his
peace
and
then
turned
and
walked
back
a
few
steps
at
this
moment
four
disciples
came
out
of
the
garden
and
asked
what
was
taking
place
judas
was
about
to
reply
but
the
soldiers
interrupted
and
would
not
let
him
speak
these
four
disciples
were
james
the
less
philip
thomas
and
nathaniel
the
last
named
who
was
a
son
of
the
aged
simeon
had
with
a
few
others
joined
the
eight
apostles
at
gethsemani
being
perhaps
sent
by
the
friends
of
jesus
to
know
what
was
going
on
or
possibly
simply
incited
by
curiosity
and
anxiety
the
other
disciples
were
wandering
to
and
fro
on
the
look
out
and
ready
to
fly
at
a
moment
notice
jesus
walked
up
to
the
soldiers
and
said
in
a
firm
and
clear
voice
seek
ye
the
soldiers
answered
of
nazareth
jesus
said
to
them
am
he
scarcely
had
he
pronounced
these
words
than
they
all
fell
to
the
ground
as
if
struck
with
apoplexy
judas
who
stood
by
them
was
much
alarmed
and
as
he
appeared
desirous
of
approaching
jesus
held
out
his
hand
and
said
whereto
art
thou
come
judas
stammered
forth
something
about
business
which
had
brought
him
jesus
answered
in
few
words
the
sense
of
which
was
were
better
for
thee
that
thou
hadst
never
been
born
however
i
can
not
remember
the
words
exactly
in
the
mean
time
the
soldiers
had
risen
and
again
approached
jesus
but
they
waited
for
the
sign
of
the
kiss
with
which
judas
had
promised
to
salute
his
master
that
they
might
recognise
him
peter
and
the
other
disciples
surrounded
judas
and
reviled
him
in
unmeasured
terms
calling
him
thief
and
traitor
he
tried
to
mollify
their
wrath
by
all
kinds
of
lies
but
his
efforts
were
vain
for
the
soldiers
came
up
and
offered
to
defend
him
which
proceeding
manifested
the
truth
at
once
jesus
again
asked
seek
ye
they
replied
of
nazareth
jesus
made
answer
have
told
you
that
i
am
he
therefore
you
seek
me
let
these
go
their
way
at
these
words
the
soldiers
fell
for
the
second
time
to
the
ground
in
convulsions
similar
to
those
of
epilepsy
and
the
apostles
again
surrounded
judas
and
expressed
their
indignation
at
his
shameful
treachery
jesus
said
to
the
soldiers
and
they
arose
but
at
first
quite
speechless
from
terror
they
then
told
judas
to
give
them
the
signal
agreed
upon
instantly
as
their
orders
were
to
seize
upon
no
one
but
him
whom
judas
kissed
judas
therefore
approached
jesus
and
gave
him
a
kiss
saying
rabbi
jesus
replied
judas
dost
thou
betray
the
son
of
man
with
a
kiss
the
soldiers
immediately
surrounded
jesus
and
the
archers
laid
hands
upon
him
judas
wished
to
fly
but
the
apostles
would
not
allow
it
they
rushed
at
the
soldiers
and
cried
out
shall
we
strike
with
the
sword
peter
who
was
more
impetuous
than
the
rest
seized
the
sword
and
struck
malchus
the
servant
of
the
high
priest
who
wished
to
drive
away
the
apostles
and
cut
off
his
right
ear
malchus
fell
to
the
ground
and
a
great
tumult
ensued
the
archers
had
seized
upon
jesus
and
wished
to
bind
him
while
malchus
and
the
rest
of
the
soldiers
stood
around
when
peter
struck
the
former
the
rest
were
occupied
in
repulsing
those
among
the
disciples
who
approached
too
near
and
in
pursuing
those
who
ran
away
four
disciples
made
their
appearance
in
the
distance
and
looked
fearfully
at
the
scene
before
them
but
the
soldiers
were
still
too
much
alarmed
at
their
late
fall
to
trouble
themselves
much
about
them
and
besides
they
did
not
wish
to
leave
our
saviour
without
a
certain
number
of
men
to
guard
him
judas
fled
as
soon
as
he
had
given
the
traitorous
kiss
but
was
met
by
some
of
the
disciples
who
overwhelmed
him
with
reproaches
six
pharisees
however
came
to
his
rescue
and
he
escaped
whilst
the
archers
were
busily
occupied
in
pinioning
jesus
when
peter
struck
malchus
jesus
said
to
him
up
again
thy
sword
into
its
place
for
all
that
take
the
sword
shall
perish
with
the
sword
thinkest
thou
that
i
can
not
ask
my
father
and
he
will
give
me
presently
more
than
twelve
legions
of
angels
how
then
shall
the
scriptures
be
fulfilled
that
so
it
must
be
done
then
he
said
me
cure
this
man
and
approaching
malchus
he
touched
his
ear
prayed
and
it
wad
healed
the
soldiers
who
were
standing
near
as
well
as
the
archers
and
the
six
pharisees
far
from
being
moved
by
this
miracle
continued
to
insult
our
lord
and
said
to
the
bystanders
is
a
trick
of
the
devil
the
powers
of
witchcraft
made
the
ear
appear
to
be
cut
off
and
now
the
same
power
gives
it
the
appearance
of
being
healed
then
jesus
again
addressed
them
are
come
out
as
it
were
to
a
robber
with
swords
and
clubs
to
apprehend
me
i
sat
daily
with
you
teaching
in
the
temple
and
you
laid
not
hands
upon
me
but
this
is
your
hour
and
the
power
of
darkness
the
pharisees
ordered
him
to
be
bound
still
more
strongly
and
made
answer
in
a
contemptuous
tone
thou
couldst
not
overthrow
us
by
thy
witchcraft
jesus
replied
but
i
do
not
remember
his
words
and
all
the
disciples
fled
the
four
archers
and
the
six
pharisees
did
not
fall
to
the
ground
at
the
words
of
jesus
because
as
was
afterwards
revealed
to
me
they
as
well
as
judas
who
likewise
did
not
fall
were
entirely
in
the
power
of
satan
whereas
all
those
who
fell
and
rose
again
were
afterwards
converted
and
became
christians
they
had
only
surrounded
jesus
and
not
laid
hands
upon
him
malchus
was
instantly
converted
by
the
cure
wrought
upon
him
and
during
the
time
of
the
passion
his
employment
was
to
carry
messages
backwards
and
forwards
to
mary
and
the
other
friends
of
our
lord
the
archers
who
now
proceeded
to
pinion
jesus
with
the
greatest
brutality
were
pagans
of
the
lowest
extraction
short
stout
and
active
with
sandy
complexions
resembling
those
of
egyptian
slaves
and
bare
legs
arms
and
neck
they
tied
his
hands
as
tightly
as
possible
with
hard
new
cords
fastening
the
wrist
under
the
left
elbow
and
the
wrist
under
the
right
elbow
they
encircled
his
waist
with
a
species
of
belt
studded
with
iron
points
and
to
this
collar
were
appended
two
leathern
straps
which
were
crossed
over
his
chest
like
a
stole
and
fastened
to
the
belt
they
then
fastened
four
ropes
to
different
parts
of
the
belt
and
by
means
of
these
ropes
dragged
our
blessed
lord
from
side
to
side
in
the
most
cruel
manner
the
ropes
were
new
i
think
they
were
purchased
when
the
pharisees
first
determined
to
arrest
jesus
the
pharisees
lighted
fresh
torches
and
the
procession
started
ten
soldiers
walked
in
front
the
archers
who
held
the
ropes
and
dragged
jesus
along
followed
and
the
pharisees
and
ten
other
soldiers
brought
up
the
rear
the
disciples
wandered
about
at
a
distance
and
wept
and
moaned
as
if
beside
themselves
from
grief
john
alone
followed
and
walked
at
no
great
distance
from
the
soldiers
until
the
pharisees
seeing
him
ordered
the
guards
to
arrest
him
they
endeavoured
to
obey
but
he
ran
away
leaving
in
their
hands
a
cloth
with
which
he
was
covered
and
of
which
they
had
taken
hold
when
they
endeavoured
to
seize
him
he
had
slipped
off
his
coat
that
he
might
escape
more
easily
from
the
hands
of
his
enemies
and
kept
nothing
on
but
a
short
under
garment
without
sleeves
and
the
long
band
which
the
jews
usually
wore
and
which
was
wrapped
round
his
neck
head
and
arms
the
archers
behaved
in
the
most
cruel
manner
to
jesus
as
they
led
him
along
this
they
did
to
curry
favour
with
the
six
pharisees
who
they
well
knew
perfectly
hated
and
detested
our
lord
they
led
him
along
the
roughest
road
they
could
select
over
the
sharpest
stones
and
through
the
thickest
mire
they
pulled
the
cords
as
tightly
as
possible
they
struck
him
with
knotted
cords
as
a
butcher
would
strike
the
beast
he
is
about
to
slaughter
and
they
accompanied
this
cruel
treatment
with
such
ignoble
and
indecent
insults
that
i
can
not
recount
them
the
feet
of
jesus
were
bare
he
wore
besides
the
ordinary
dress
a
seamless
woollen
garment
and
a
cloak
which
was
thrown
over
all
i
have
forgotten
to
state
that
when
jesus
was
arrested
it
was
done
without
any
order
being
presented
or
legal
ceremony
taking
place
he
was
treated
as
a
person
without
the
pale
of
the
law
the
procession
proceeded
at
a
good
pace
when
they
left
the
road
which
runs
between
the
garden
of
olives
and
that
of
gethsemani
they
turned
to
the
right
and
soon
reached
a
bridge
which
was
thrown
over
the
torrent
of
cedron
when
jesus
went
to
the
garden
of
olives
with
the
apostles
he
did
not
cross
this
bridge
but
went
by
a
private
path
which
ran
through
the
valley
of
josaphat
and
led
to
another
bridge
more
to
the
south
the
bridge
over
which
the
soldiers
led
jesus
was
long
being
thrown
over
not
only
the
torrent
which
was
very
large
in
this
part
but
likewise
over
the
valley
which
extends
a
considerable
distance
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
is
much
lower
than
the
bed
of
the
river
i
saw
our
lord
fall
twice
before
he
reached
the
bridge
and
these
falls
were
caused
entirely
by
the
barbarous
manner
in
which
the
soldiers
dragged
him
but
when
they
were
half
over
the
bridge
they
gave
full
vent
to
their
brutal
inclination
and
struck
jesus
with
such
violence
that
they
threw
him
off
the
bridge
into
the
water
and
scornfully
recommended
him
to
quench
his
thirst
there
if
god
had
not
preserved
him
he
must
have
been
killed
by
this
fall
he
fell
first
on
his
knee
and
then
on
his
face
but
saved
himself
a
little
by
stretching
out
his
hands
which
although
so
tightly
bound
before
were
loosened
i
know
not
whether
by
miracle
or
whether
the
soldiers
had
cut
the
cords
before
they
threw
him
into
the
water
the
marks
of
his
feet
his
elbows
and
his
fingers
were
miraculously
impressed
on
the
rock
on
which
he
fell
and
these
impressions
were
afterwards
shown
for
the
veneration
of
christians
these
stones
were
less
hard
than
the
unbelieving
hearts
of
the
wicked
men
who
surrounded
jesus
and
bore
witness
at
this
terrible
moment
to
the
divine
power
which
had
touched
them
i
had
not
seen
jesus
take
anything
to
quench
the
thirst
which
had
consumed
him
ever
since
his
agony
in
the
garden
but
he
drank
when
he
fell
into
the
cedron
and
i
heard
him
repeat
these
words
from
the
prophetic
psalm
his
thirst
he
will
drink
water
from
the
psalm
the
archers
still
held
the
ends
of
the
ropes
with
which
jesus
was
bound
but
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
drag
him
out
of
the
water
on
that
side
on
account
of
a
wall
which
was
built
on
the
shore
they
turned
back
and
dragged
him
quite
through
the
cedron
to
the
shore
and
then
made
him
cross
the
bridge
a
second
time
accompanying
their
every
action
with
insults
blasphemies
and
blows
his
long
woollen
garment
which
was
quite
soaked
through
adhered
to
his
legs
impeded
every
movement
and
rendered
it
almost
impossible
for
him
to
walk
and
when
he
reached
the
end
of
the
bridge
he
fell
quite
down
they
pulled
him
up
again
in
the
most
cruel
manner
struck
him
with
cords
and
fastened
the
ends
of
his
wet
garment
to
the
belt
abusing
him
at
the
same
time
in
the
most
cowardly
manner
it
was
not
quite
midnight
when
i
saw
the
four
archers
inhumanly
dragging
jesus
over
a
narrow
path
which
was
choked
up
with
stones
garments
of
rock
thistles
and
thorns
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
cedron
the
six
brutal
pharisees
walked
as
close
to
our
lord
as
they
could
struck
him
constantly
with
thick
pointed
sticks
and
seeing
that
his
bare
and
bleeding
feet
were
torn
by
the
stones
and
briars
exclaimed
scornfully
precursor
john
the
baptist
has
certainly
not
prepared
a
good
path
for
him
here
or
words
of
malachy
behold
i
send
my
angel
before
thy
face
to
prepare
the
way
before
thee
do
not
exactly
apply
now
every
jest
uttered
by
these
men
incited
the
archers
to
greater
cruelty
the
enemies
of
jesus
remarked
that
several
persons
made
their
appearance
in
the
distance
they
were
only
disciples
who
had
assembled
when
they
heard
that
their
master
was
arrested
and
who
were
anxious
to
discover
what
the
end
would
be
but
the
sight
of
them
rendered
the
pharisees
uneasy
lest
any
attempt
should
be
made
to
rescue
jesus
and
they
therefore
sent
for
a
reinforcement
of
soldiers
at
a
very
short
distance
from
an
entrance
opposite
to
the
south
side
of
the
temple
which
leads
through
a
little
village
called
ophel
to
mount
sion
where
the
residences
of
annas
and
caiphas
were
situated
i
saw
a
band
of
about
fifty
soldiers
who
carried
torches
and
appeared
ready
for
anything
the
demeanour
of
these
men
was
outrageous
and
they
gave
loud
shouts
both
to
announce
their
arrival
and
to
congratulate
their
comrades
upon
the
success
of
the
expedition
this
caused
a
slight
confusion
among
the
soldiers
who
were
leading
jesus
and
malchus
and
a
few
others
took
advantage
of
it
to
depart
and
fly
towards
mount
olivet
when
the
fresh
band
of
soldiers
left
ophel
i
saw
those
disciples
who
had
gathered
together
disperse
some
went
one
way
and
some
another
the
blessed
virgin
and
about
nine
of
the
holy
women
being
filled
with
anxiety
directed
their
steps
towards
the
valley
of
josaphat
accompanied
by
lazarus
john
the
son
of
mark
the
son
of
veronica
and
the
son
of
simon
the
was
at
gethsemani
with
nathaniel
and
the
eight
apostles
and
had
fled
when
the
soldiers
appeared
he
was
giving
the
blessed
virgin
the
account
of
all
that
had
been
done
when
the
fresh
band
of
soldiers
joined
those
who
were
leading
jesus
and
she
then
heard
their
tumultuous
vociferations
and
saw
the
light
of
the
torches
they
carried
this
sight
quite
overcame
her
she
became
insensible
and
john
took
her
into
the
house
of
mary
the
mother
of
mark
the
fifty
soldiers
who
were
sent
to
join
those
who
had
taken
jesus
were
a
detachment
from
a
company
of
three
hundred
men
posted
to
guard
the
gates
and
environs
of
ophel
for
the
traitor
judas
had
reminded
the
high
priests
that
the
inhabitants
of
ophel
who
were
principally
of
the
labouring
class
and
whose
chief
employment
was
to
bring
water
and
wood
to
the
temple
were
the
most
attached
partisans
of
jesus
and
might
perhaps
make
some
attempts
to
rescue
him
the
traitor
was
aware
that
jesus
had
both
consoled
instructed
assisted
and
cured
the
diseases
of
many
of
these
poor
workmen
and
that
ophel
was
the
place
where
he
halted
during
his
journey
from
bethania
to
hebron
when
john
the
baptist
had
just
been
executed
judas
also
knew
that
jesus
had
cured
many
of
the
masons
who
were
injured
by
the
fall
of
the
tower
of
siloe
the
greatest
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
ophel
were
converted
after
the
death
of
our
lord
and
joined
the
first
christian
community
that
was
formed
after
pentecost
and
when
the
christians
separated
from
the
jews
and
erected
new
dwellings
they
placed
their
huts
and
tents
in
the
valley
which
is
situated
between
mount
olivet
and
ophel
and
there
stephen
lived
ophel
was
on
a
hill
to
the
south
of
the
temple
surrounded
by
walls
and
its
inhabitants
were
very
poor
i
think
it
was
smaller
than
the
slumbers
of
the
good
inhabitants
of
ophel
were
disturbed
by
the
noise
of
the
soldiers
they
came
out
of
their
houses
and
ran
to
the
entrance
of
the
village
to
ask
the
cause
of
the
uproar
but
the
soldiers
received
them
roughly
ordered
them
to
return
home
and
in
reply
to
their
numerous
questions
said
have
just
arrested
jesus
your
false
prophet
he
who
has
deceived
you
so
grossly
the
high
priests
are
about
to
judge
him
and
he
will
be
crucified
cries
and
lamentations
arose
on
all
sides
the
poor
women
and
children
ran
backwards
and
forwards
weeping
and
wringing
their
hands
and
calling
to
mind
all
the
benefits
they
had
received
from
our
lord
they
cast
themselves
on
their
knees
to
implore
the
protection
of
heaven
but
the
soldiers
pushed
them
on
one
side
struck
them
obliged
them
to
return
to
their
houses
and
exclaimed
farther
proof
is
required
does
not
the
conduct
of
these
persons
show
plainly
that
the
galilean
incites
rebellion
they
were
however
a
little
cautious
in
their
expressions
and
demeanour
for
fear
of
causing
an
insurrection
in
ophel
and
therefore
only
endeavoured
to
drive
the
inhabitants
away
from
those
parts
of
the
village
which
jesus
was
obliged
to
cross
when
the
cruel
soldiers
who
led
our
lord
were
near
the
gates
of
ophel
he
again
fell
and
appeared
unable
to
proceed
a
step
farther
upon
which
one
among
them
being
moved
to
compassion
said
to
another
see
the
poor
man
is
perfectly
exhausted
he
can
not
support
himself
with
the
weight
of
his
chains
if
we
wish
to
get
him
to
the
high
priest
alive
we
must
loosen
the
cords
with
which
his
hands
are
bound
that
he
may
be
able
to
save
himself
a
little
when
he
falls
the
band
stopped
for
a
moment
the
fetters
were
loosened
and
another
soldier
brought
some
water
to
jesus
from
a
neighbouring
fountain
jesus
thanked
him
and
spoke
of
the
of
living
water
of
which
those
who
believed
in
him
should
drink
but
his
words
enraged
the
pharisees
still
more
and
they
overwhelmed
him
with
insults
and
contumelious
language
i
saw
the
heart
of
the
soldier
who
had
caused
jesus
to
be
unbound
as
also
that
of
the
one
who
brought
him
water
suddenly
illuminated
by
grace
they
were
both
converted
before
the
death
of
jesus
and
immediately
joined
his
disciples
the
procession
started
again
and
reached
the
gate
of
ophel
here
jesus
was
again
saluted
by
the
cries
of
grief
and
sympathy
of
those
who
owed
him
so
much
gratitude
and
the
soldiers
had
considerable
difficulty
in
keeping
back
the
men
and
women
who
crowded
round
from
all
parts
they
clasped
their
hands
fell
on
their
knees
lamented
and
exclaimed
this
man
unto
us
release
him
who
will
assist
who
will
console
us
who
will
cure
our
diseases
release
him
unto
us
it
was
indeed
to
look
upon
jesus
his
face
was
white
disfigured
and
wounded
his
hair
dishevelled
his
dress
wet
and
soiled
and
his
savage
and
drunken
guards
were
dragging
him
about
and
striking
him
with
sticks
like
a
poor
dumb
animal
led
to
the
slaughter
thus
was
he
conducted
through
the
midst
of
the
afflicted
inhabitants
of
ophel
and
the
paralytic
whom
he
had
cured
the
dumb
to
whom
he
had
restored
speech
and
the
blind
whose
eyes
he
had
opened
united
but
in
vain
in
offering
supplications
for
his
release
many
persons
from
among
the
lowest
and
most
degraded
classes
had
been
sent
by
annas
caiphas
and
the
other
enemies
of
jesus
to
join
the
procession
and
assist
the
soldiers
both
in
jesus
and
in
driving
away
the
inhabitants
of
ophel
the
village
of
ophel
was
seated
upon
a
hill
and
i
saw
a
great
deal
of
timber
placed
there
ready
for
building
the
procession
had
to
proceed
down
a
hill
and
then
pass
through
a
door
made
in
the
wall
on
one
side
of
this
door
stood
a
large
building
erected
originally
by
solomon
and
on
the
other
the
pool
of
bethsaida
after
passing
this
they
followed
a
westerly
direction
down
a
steep
street
called
millo
at
the
end
of
which
a
turn
to
the
south
brought
them
to
the
house
of
annas
the
guards
never
ceased
their
cruel
treatment
of
our
divine
saviour
and
excused
such
conduct
by
saying
that
the
crowds
who
gathered
together
in
front
of
the
procession
compelled
them
to
severity
jesus
fell
seven
times
between
mount
olivet
and
the
house
of
annas
the
inhabitants
of
ophel
were
still
in
a
state
of
consternation
and
grief
when
the
sight
of
the
blessed
virgin
who
passed
through
the
village
accompanied
by
the
holy
women
and
some
other
friends
on
her
way
from
the
valley
of
cedron
to
the
house
of
mary
the
mother
of
mark
excited
them
still
more
and
they
made
the
place
with
sobs
and
lamentations
while
they
surrounded
and
almost
carried
her
in
their
arms
mary
was
speechless
from
grief
and
did
not
open
her
lips
after
she
reached
the
house
of
mary
the
mother
of
mark
until
the
arrival
of
john
who
related
all
he
had
seen
since
jesus
left
the
and
a
little
later
she
was
taken
to
the
house
of
martha
which
was
near
that
of
lazarus
peter
and
john
who
had
followed
jesus
at
a
distance
went
in
haste
to
some
servants
of
the
high
priest
with
whom
the
latter
was
acquainted
in
order
to
endeavour
by
their
means
to
obtain
admittance
into
the
tribunal
where
their
master
was
to
be
tried
these
servants
acted
as
messengers
and
had
just
been
ordered
to
go
to
the
houses
of
the
ancients
and
other
members
of
the
council
to
summon
them
to
attend
the
meeting
which
was
convoked
as
they
were
anxious
to
oblige
the
apostles
but
foresaw
much
difficulty
in
obtaining
their
admittance
into
the
tribunal
they
gave
them
cloaks
similar
to
those
they
themselves
wore
and
made
them
assist
in
carrying
messages
to
the
members
in
order
that
afterwards
they
might
enter
the
tribunal
of
caiphas
and
mingle
without
being
recognised
among
the
soldiers
and
false
witnesses
as
all
other
persons
were
to
be
expelled
as
nicodemus
joseph
of
arimathea
and
other
persons
were
members
of
this
council
the
apostles
undertook
to
let
them
know
what
was
going
to
be
done
in
the
council
thus
securing
the
presence
of
those
friends
of
jesus
whom
the
pharisees
had
purposely
omitted
to
invite
in
the
mean
time
judas
wandered
up
and
down
the
steep
and
wild
precipices
at
the
south
of
jerusalem
despair
marked
on
his
every
feature
and
the
devil
pursuing
him
to
and
fro
filling
his
imagination
with
still
darker
visions
and
not
allowing
him
a
moment
respite
chapter
iv
means
employed
by
the
enemies
of
jesus
for
carrying
out
their
designs
against
him
no
sooner
was
jesus
arrested
than
annas
and
caiphas
were
informed
and
instantly
began
to
arrange
their
plans
with
regard
to
the
course
to
be
pursued
confusion
speedily
reigned
everywhere
the
rooms
were
lighted
up
in
haste
guards
placed
at
the
entrances
and
messengers
dispatched
to
different
parts
of
the
town
to
convoke
the
members
of
the
council
the
scribes
and
all
who
were
to
take
a
part
in
the
trial
many
among
them
had
however
assembled
at
the
house
of
caiphas
as
soon
as
the
treacherous
compact
with
judas
was
completed
and
had
remained
there
to
await
the
course
of
events
the
different
classes
of
ancients
were
likewise
assembled
and
as
the
pharisees
sadducees
and
herodians
were
congregated
in
jerusalem
from
all
parts
of
the
country
for
the
celebration
of
the
festival
and
had
long
been
concerting
measures
with
the
council
for
the
arrest
of
our
lord
the
high
priests
now
sent
for
those
whom
they
knew
to
be
the
most
bitterly
opposed
to
jesus
and
desired
them
to
assemble
the
witnesses
gather
together
every
possible
proof
and
bring
all
before
the
council
the
proud
sadducees
of
nazareth
of
capharnaum
of
thirza
of
gabara
of
jotapata
and
of
silo
whom
jesus
had
so
often
reproved
before
the
people
were
actually
dying
for
revenge
they
hastened
to
all
the
inns
to
seek
out
those
persons
whom
they
knew
to
be
enemies
of
our
lord
and
offered
them
bribes
in
order
to
secure
their
appearance
but
with
the
exception
of
a
few
ridiculous
calumnies
which
were
certain
to
be
disproved
a
soon
as
investigated
nothing
tangible
could
be
brought
forward
against
jesus
excepting
indeed
those
foolish
accusations
which
he
had
so
often
refuted
in
the
synagogue
the
enemies
of
jesus
hastened
however
to
the
tribunal
of
caiphas
escorted
by
the
scribes
and
pharisees
of
jerusalem
and
accompanied
by
many
of
those
merchants
whom
our
lord
drove
out
of
the
temple
when
they
were
holding
market
there
as
also
by
the
proud
doctors
whom
he
had
silenced
before
all
the
people
and
even
by
some
who
could
not
forgive
the
humiliation
of
being
convicted
of
error
when
he
disputed
with
them
in
the
temple
at
the
age
of
twelve
there
was
likewise
a
large
body
of
impenitent
sinners
whom
he
had
refused
to
cure
relapsed
sinners
whose
diseases
had
returned
worldly
young
men
whom
he
would
not
receive
as
disciples
avaricious
persons
whom
he
had
enraged
by
causing
the
money
which
they
had
been
in
hopes
of
possessing
to
be
distributed
in
alms
others
there
were
whose
friends
he
had
cured
and
who
had
thus
been
disappointed
in
their
expectations
of
inheriting
property
debauchees
whose
victims
he
had
converted
and
many
despicable
characters
who
made
their
fortunes
by
flattering
and
fostering
the
vices
of
the
great
all
these
emissaries
of
satan
were
overflowing
with
rage
against
everything
holy
and
consequently
with
an
indescribable
hatred
of
the
holy
of
holies
they
were
farther
incited
by
the
enemies
of
our
lord
and
therefore
assembled
in
crowds
round
the
palace
of
caiphas
to
bring
forward
all
their
false
accusations
and
to
endeavour
to
cover
with
infamy
that
spotless
lamb
who
took
upon
himself
the
sins
of
the
world
and
accepted
the
burden
in
order
to
reconcile
man
with
god
whilst
all
these
wicked
beings
were
busily
consulting
as
to
what
was
best
to
be
done
anguish
and
anxiety
filled
the
hearts
of
the
friends
of
jesus
for
they
were
ignorant
of
the
mystery
which
was
about
to
be
accomplished
and
they
wandered
about
sighing
and
listening
to
every
different
opinion
each
word
they
uttered
gave
raise
to
feelings
of
suspicion
on
the
part
of
those
who
they
addressed
and
if
they
were
silent
their
silence
was
set
down
as
wrong
many
but
weak
and
undecided
characters
yielded
to
temptation
were
scandalised
and
lost
their
fait
indeed
the
number
of
those
who
persevered
was
very
small
indeed
things
were
the
same
then
as
they
oftentimes
are
now
persons
were
willing
to
serve
god
if
they
met
with
no
opposition
from
their
fellowcreatures
but
were
ashamed
of
the
cross
if
held
in
contempt
by
others
the
hearts
of
some
were
however
touched
by
the
patience
displayed
by
our
lord
in
the
midst
of
his
sufferings
and
they
walked
away
silent
and
sad
chapter
a
glance
at
jerusalem
the
customary
prayers
and
preparations
for
the
celebration
of
the
festival
being
completed
the
greatest
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
of
jerusalem
as
also
the
strangers
congregated
there
were
plunged
in
sleep
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
when
all
at
once
the
arrest
of
jesus
was
announced
and
everyone
was
aroused
both
his
friends
and
foes
and
numbers
immediately
responded
to
the
summons
of
the
high
priest
and
left
their
dwellings
to
assemble
at
his
court
in
some
parts
the
light
of
the
moon
enabled
them
to
grope
their
way
in
safety
along
the
dark
and
gloomy
streets
but
in
other
parts
they
were
obliged
to
make
use
of
torches
very
few
of
the
houses
were
built
with
their
windows
looking
on
the
street
and
generally
speaking
their
doors
were
in
inner
courts
which
gave
the
streets
a
still
more
gloomy
appearance
than
is
usual
at
this
hour
the
steps
of
all
were
directed
towards
sion
and
an
attentive
listener
might
have
heard
persons
stop
at
the
doors
of
their
friends
and
knock
in
order
to
awaken
them
then
hurry
on
then
again
stop
to
question
others
and
finally
set
off
anew
in
haste
towards
sion
newsmongers
and
servants
were
hurrying
forward
to
ascertain
what
was
going
on
in
order
that
they
might
return
and
give
the
account
to
those
who
remained
at
home
and
the
bolting
and
barricading
of
doors
might
be
plainly
heard
as
many
persons
were
much
alarmed
and
feared
an
insurrection
while
a
thousand
different
propositions
were
made
and
opinions
given
such
as
the
following
and
his
sisters
will
soon
know
who
is
this
man
in
whom
they
have
placed
such
firm
reliance
johanna
chusa
susannah
mary
the
mother
of
mark
and
salome
will
repent
but
too
late
the
imprudence
of
their
conduct
seraphia
the
wife
of
sirach
will
be
compelled
to
make
an
apology
to
her
husband
now
for
he
has
so
often
reproached
her
with
her
partiality
for
the
galilean
the
partisans
of
this
fanatical
man
this
inciter
of
rebellion
pretended
to
be
filled
with
compassion
for
all
who
looked
upon
things
in
a
different
light
from
themselves
and
now
they
will
not
know
where
to
hide
their
heads
he
will
find
no
one
now
to
cast
garments
and
strew
at
his
feet
those
hypocrites
who
pretended
to
be
so
much
better
than
other
persons
will
receive
their
deserts
for
they
are
all
implicated
with
the
galilean
it
is
a
much
more
serious
business
than
was
at
first
thought
i
should
like
to
know
how
nicodemus
and
joseph
of
arimathea
will
get
out
of
it
the
high
priests
have
mistrusted
them
for
some
time
they
made
common
cause
with
lazarus
but
they
are
extremely
cunning
all
will
now
however
be
brought
to
light
speeches
such
as
these
were
uttered
by
persons
who
were
exasperated
not
only
against
the
disciples
of
jesus
but
likewise
with
the
holy
women
who
had
supplied
his
temporal
wants
and
had
publicly
and
fearlessly
expressed
their
veneration
for
his
doctrines
and
their
belief
in
his
divine
mission
but
although
many
persons
spoke
of
jesus
and
his
followers
in
this
contemptuous
manner
yet
there
were
others
who
held
very
different
opinions
and
of
these
some
were
frightened
and
others
being
overcome
with
sorrow
sought
friends
to
whom
they
might
unburden
their
hearts
and
before
whom
they
could
without
fear
give
vent
to
their
feelings
but
the
number
of
those
sufficiently
daring
openly
to
avow
their
admiration
for
jesus
was
but
small
nevertheless
it
was
in
parts
only
of
jerusalem
that
these
disturbances
took
place
in
those
parts
where
the
messengers
had
been
sent
by
the
high
priests
and
the
pharisees
to
convoke
the
members
of
the
council
and
to
call
together
the
witnesses
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
saw
feelings
of
hatred
and
fury
burst
forth
in
different
parts
of
the
city
under
the
form
of
flames
which
flames
traversed
the
streets
united
with
others
which
they
met
and
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
sion
increasing
every
moment
and
at
last
came
to
a
stop
beneath
the
tribunal
of
caiphas
where
they
remained
forming
together
a
perfect
whirlwind
of
fire
the
roman
soldiers
took
no
part
in
what
was
going
on
they
did
not
understand
the
excited
feelings
of
the
people
but
their
sentinels
were
doubled
their
cohorts
drawn
up
and
they
kept
a
strict
look
out
this
indeed
was
customary
at
the
time
of
the
paschal
solemnity
on
account
of
the
vast
number
of
strangers
who
were
then
assembled
together
the
pharisees
endeavoured
to
avoid
the
neighbourhood
of
the
sentinels
for
fear
of
being
questioned
by
them
and
of
contracting
defilement
by
answering
their
questions
the
high
priests
had
sent
a
message
to
pilate
intimating
their
reasons
for
stationing
soldiers
round
ophel
and
sion
but
he
mistrusted
their
intentions
as
much
existed
between
the
romans
and
the
jews
he
could
not
sleep
but
walked
about
during
the
greatest
part
of
the
night
hearkening
to
the
different
reports
and
issuing
orders
consequent
on
what
he
heard
his
wife
slept
but
her
sleep
was
disturbed
by
frightful
dreams
and
she
groaned
and
wept
alternately
in
no
part
of
jerusalem
did
the
arrest
of
jesus
produce
more
touching
demonstrations
of
grief
than
among
the
poor
inhabitants
of
ophel
the
greatest
part
of
whom
were
daylabourers
and
the
rest
principally
employed
in
menial
offices
in
the
service
of
the
temple
the
news
came
unexpectedly
upon
them
for
some
time
they
doubted
the
truth
of
the
report
and
wavered
between
hope
and
fear
but
the
sight
of
their
master
their
benefactor
their
consoler
dragged
through
the
streets
torn
bruised
and
in
every
imaginable
way
filled
them
with
horror
and
their
grief
was
still
farther
increased
by
beholding
his
afflicted
mother
wandering
about
from
street
to
street
accompanied
by
the
holy
women
and
endeavouring
to
obtain
some
intelligence
concerning
her
divine
son
these
holy
women
were
often
obliged
to
hide
in
corners
and
under
for
fear
of
being
seen
by
the
enemies
of
jesus
but
even
with
these
precautions
they
were
oftentimes
insulted
and
taken
for
women
of
bad
character
their
feelings
were
frequently
harrowed
by
hearing
the
malignant
words
and
triumphant
expressions
of
the
cruel
jews
and
seldom
very
seldom
did
a
word
of
kindness
or
pity
strike
their
ears
they
were
completely
exhausted
before
reaching
their
place
of
refuge
but
they
endeavoured
to
console
and
support
one
another
and
wrapped
thick
veils
over
their
heads
when
at
last
seated
they
heard
a
sudden
knock
at
the
door
and
listened
breathlessly
the
knock
was
repeated
but
softly
therefore
they
made
certain
that
it
was
no
enemy
and
yet
they
opened
the
door
cautiously
fearing
a
stratagem
it
was
indeed
a
friend
and
they
issued
forth
and
walked
about
for
a
time
and
then
again
returned
to
their
place
of
refuge
still
more
heartbroken
than
before
the
majority
of
the
apostles
overcome
with
terror
were
wandering
about
among
the
valleys
which
surround
jerusalem
and
at
times
took
refuge
in
the
caverns
beneath
mount
olivet
they
started
if
they
came
in
contact
with
one
another
spoke
in
trembling
tones
and
separated
on
the
least
noise
being
heard
first
they
concealed
themselves
in
one
cave
and
then
in
another
next
they
endeavoured
to
return
to
the
town
while
some
of
their
number
climbed
to
the
top
of
mount
olivet
and
cast
anxious
glances
at
the
torches
the
light
of
which
they
could
see
glimmering
at
and
about
sion
they
listened
to
every
distant
sound
made
a
thousand
different
conjectures
and
then
returned
to
the
valley
in
hopes
of
getting
some
certain
intelligence
the
streets
in
the
vicinity
of
caiphas
tribunal
were
brightly
illuminated
with
lamps
and
torches
but
as
the
crowds
gathered
around
it
the
noise
and
confusion
continued
to
increase
mingling
with
these
discordant
sounds
might
be
heard
the
bellowing
of
the
beasts
which
were
tethered
on
the
outside
of
the
walls
of
jerusalem
and
the
plaintive
bleating
of
the
lambs
there
was
something
most
touching
in
the
bleating
of
these
lambs
which
were
to
be
sacrificed
on
the
following
day
in
the
temple
the
one
lamb
alone
who
was
about
to
be
offered
a
willing
sacrifice
opened
not
his
mouth
like
a
sheep
in
the
hands
of
the
butcher
which
resists
not
or
the
lamb
which
is
silent
before
the
shearer
and
that
lamb
was
the
lamb
of
god
the
lamb
without
spot
the
true
paschal
lamb
jesus
christ
himself
the
sky
looked
dark
gloomy
and
threatening
the
moon
was
red
and
covered
with
livid
spots
it
appeared
as
if
dreading
to
reach
its
full
because
its
creator
was
then
to
die
next
i
cast
a
glance
outside
the
town
and
near
the
south
gate
i
beheld
the
traitor
judas
iscariot
wandering
about
alone
and
a
prey
to
the
tortures
of
his
guilty
conscience
he
feared
even
his
own
shadow
and
was
followed
by
many
devils
who
endeavoured
to
turn
his
feelings
of
remorse
into
black
despair
thousands
of
evil
spirits
were
busying
themselves
in
all
parts
tempting
men
first
to
one
sin
and
then
to
another
it
appeared
as
if
the
gates
of
hell
were
flung
open
and
satan
madly
striving
and
exerting
his
whole
energies
to
increase
the
heavy
load
of
iniquities
which
the
lamb
without
spot
had
taken
upon
himself
the
angels
wavered
between
joy
and
grief
they
desired
ardently
to
fall
prostrate
before
the
throne
of
god
and
to
obtain
permission
to
assist
jesus
but
at
the
same
time
they
were
filled
with
astonishment
and
could
only
adore
that
miracle
of
divine
justice
and
mercy
which
had
existed
in
heaven
for
all
eternity
and
was
now
about
to
be
accomplished
for
the
angels
believe
like
us
in
god
the
father
almighty
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
and
in
jesus
christ
his
only
son
our
lord
who
was
conceived
by
the
holy
ghost
born
of
the
virgin
mary
who
began
on
this
night
to
suffer
under
pontius
pilate
and
the
next
day
was
to
be
crucified
to
die
and
be
buried
descend
into
hell
rise
again
on
the
third
day
ascent
into
heaven
be
seated
at
the
right
hand
of
god
the
father
almighty
and
from
thence
come
to
judge
the
living
and
the
dead
they
likewise
believe
in
the
holy
ghost
the
holy
catholic
church
the
communion
of
saints
the
forgiveness
of
sins
the
resurrection
of
the
body
and
life
everlasting
chapter
vi
jesus
before
annas
it
was
towards
midnight
when
jesus
reached
the
palace
of
annas
and
his
guards
immediately
conducted
him
into
a
very
large
hall
where
annas
surrounded
by
twentyeight
councillors
was
seated
on
a
species
of
platform
raised
a
little
above
the
level
of
the
floor
and
placed
opposite
to
the
entrance
the
soldiers
who
first
arrested
jesus
now
dragged
him
roughly
to
the
foot
of
the
tribunal
the
room
was
quite
full
between
soldiers
the
servants
of
annas
a
number
of
the
mob
who
had
been
admitted
and
the
false
witnesses
who
afterwards
adjourned
to
caiphas
hall
annas
was
delighted
at
the
thought
of
our
lord
being
brought
before
him
and
was
looking
out
for
his
arrival
with
the
greatest
impatience
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
most
repulsive
as
it
showed
in
every
lineament
not
only
the
infernal
joy
with
which
he
was
filled
but
likewise
all
the
cunning
and
duplicity
of
this
heart
he
was
the
president
of
a
species
of
tribunal
instituted
for
the
purpose
of
examining
persons
accused
of
teaching
false
doctrines
and
if
convicted
there
they
were
then
taken
before
the
high
priest
jesus
stood
before
annas
he
looked
exhausted
and
haggard
his
garments
were
covered
with
mud
his
hands
manacled
his
head
bowed
down
and
he
spoke
not
a
word
annas
was
a
thin
old
man
with
a
scraggy
beard
his
pride
and
arrogance
were
great
and
as
he
seated
himself
he
smiled
ironically
pretending
that
he
knew
nothing
at
all
and
that
he
was
perfectly
astonished
at
finding
that
the
prisoner
whom
he
had
just
been
informed
was
to
be
brought
before
him
was
no
other
than
jesus
of
nazareth
it
possible
said
he
it
possible
that
thou
art
jesus
of
nazareth
where
are
thy
disciples
thy
numerous
followers
where
is
thy
kingdom
i
fear
affairs
have
not
turned
out
as
thou
didst
expect
the
authorities
i
presume
discovered
that
it
was
quite
time
to
put
a
stop
to
thy
conduct
disrespectful
as
it
was
towards
god
and
his
priests
and
to
such
violations
of
the
sabbath
what
disciples
hast
thou
now
where
are
they
all
gone
thou
are
silent
speak
out
seducer
speak
out
thou
inciter
of
rebellion
didst
thou
not
eat
the
paschal
lamb
in
an
unlawful
manner
at
an
improper
time
and
in
an
improper
place
dost
thou
not
desire
to
introduce
new
doctrines
who
gave
thee
the
right
of
preaching
where
didst
thou
study
speak
what
are
the
tenets
of
thy
religion
jesus
then
raised
his
weary
head
looked
at
annas
and
said
have
spoken
openly
to
the
world
i
have
always
taught
in
the
synagogue
and
in
the
temple
whither
all
the
jews
resort
and
in
secret
i
have
spoken
nothing
why
askest
thou
me
ask
them
who
have
heard
what
i
have
spoken
unto
them
behold
they
know
what
thing
i
have
said
at
this
answer
of
jesus
the
countenance
of
annas
flushed
with
fury
and
indignation
a
base
menial
who
was
standing
near
perceived
this
and
he
immediately
struck
our
lord
on
the
face
with
his
iron
gauntlet
exclaiming
at
the
same
moment
thou
the
high
priest
so
jesus
was
so
nearly
prostrated
by
the
violence
of
the
blow
that
when
the
guards
likewise
reviled
and
struck
him
he
fell
quite
down
and
blood
trickled
from
his
face
on
to
the
floor
laughter
insults
and
bitter
words
resounded
through
the
hall
the
archers
dragged
him
roughly
up
again
and
he
mildly
answered
i
have
spoken
evil
give
testimony
of
the
evil
but
if
well
why
strikest
thou
me
annas
became
still
more
enraged
when
he
saw
the
calm
demeanour
of
jesus
and
turning
to
the
witnesses
he
desired
them
to
bring
forward
their
accusations
they
all
began
to
speak
at
once
has
called
himself
king
he
says
that
god
is
his
father
that
the
pharisees
are
an
adulterous
generation
he
causes
insurrection
among
the
people
he
cures
the
sick
by
the
help
of
the
devil
on
the
the
inhabitants
of
ophel
assembled
round
him
a
short
time
ago
and
addressed
him
by
the
titles
of
saviour
and
prophet
he
lets
himself
be
called
the
son
of
god
he
says
that
he
is
sent
by
god
he
predicts
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
he
does
not
fast
he
eats
with
sinners
with
pagans
and
with
publicans
and
associates
with
women
of
evil
repute
a
short
time
ago
he
said
to
a
man
who
gave
him
some
water
to
drink
at
the
gates
of
ophel
that
he
would
give
unto
him
the
water
of
eternal
life
after
drinking
which
he
would
thirst
no
more
he
seduces
the
people
by
words
of
double
meaning
etc
these
accusations
were
all
vociferated
at
once
some
of
the
witnesses
stood
before
jesus
and
insulted
him
while
they
spoke
by
derisive
gestures
and
the
archers
went
so
far
as
even
to
strike
him
saying
at
the
same
time
why
dost
thou
not
answer
annas
and
his
adherents
added
mockery
to
insult
exclaiming
at
every
pause
in
the
accusations
is
thy
doctrine
then
is
it
what
canst
thou
answer
to
this
issue
thy
orders
great
king
man
sent
by
god
give
proofs
of
thy
mission
art
thou
continued
annas
in
a
tone
of
cutting
contempt
whom
art
thou
sent
art
thou
the
son
of
an
obscure
carpenter
or
art
thou
elias
who
was
carried
up
to
heaven
in
a
fiery
chariot
he
is
said
to
be
still
living
and
i
have
been
told
that
thou
canst
make
thyself
invisible
when
thou
pleasest
perhaps
thou
art
the
prophet
malachy
whose
words
thou
dost
so
frequently
quote
some
say
that
an
angel
was
his
father
and
that
he
likewise
is
still
alive
an
impostor
as
thou
art
could
not
have
a
finer
opportunity
of
taking
persons
in
than
by
passing
thyself
off
as
this
prophet
tell
me
without
farther
preamble
to
what
order
of
kings
thou
dost
belong
thou
art
greater
than
solomon
at
least
thou
pretendest
so
to
be
and
dost
even
expect
to
be
believed
be
easy
i
will
no
longer
refuse
the
title
and
the
sceptre
which
are
so
justly
thy
due
annas
then
called
for
the
sheet
of
parchment
about
a
yard
in
length
and
six
inches
in
width
on
this
he
wrote
a
series
of
words
in
large
letters
and
each
word
expressed
some
different
accusation
which
had
been
brought
against
our
lord
he
then
rolled
it
up
placed
it
in
a
little
hollow
tube
fastened
it
carefully
on
the
top
of
a
reed
and
presented
this
reed
to
jesus
saying
at
the
same
time
with
a
contemptuous
sneer
the
sceptre
of
thy
kingdom
it
contains
thy
titles
as
also
the
account
of
the
honours
to
which
thou
art
entitled
and
thy
right
to
the
throne
take
them
to
the
high
priest
in
order
that
he
may
acknowledge
thy
regal
dignity
and
treat
thee
according
to
thy
deserts
tie
the
hands
of
this
king
and
take
him
before
the
high
priest
the
hands
of
jesus
which
had
been
loosened
were
then
tied
across
his
breast
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
him
hold
the
pretended
sceptre
which
contained
the
accusations
of
annas
and
he
was
led
to
the
court
of
caiphas
amidst
the
hisses
shouts
and
blows
lavished
upon
him
by
the
brutal
mob
the
house
of
annas
was
not
more
than
three
hundred
steps
from
that
of
caiphas
there
were
high
walls
and
houses
on
each
side
of
the
road
which
was
lighted
up
by
torches
and
lanterns
placed
on
poles
and
there
were
numbers
of
jews
standing
about
talking
in
an
angry
excited
manner
the
soldiers
could
scarcely
make
their
way
through
the
crowd
and
those
who
had
behaved
so
shamefully
to
jesus
at
the
court
of
annas
continued
their
insults
and
base
usage
during
the
whole
of
the
time
sent
in
walking
to
the
house
of
caiphas
i
saw
money
given
to
those
who
behaved
the
worst
to
jesus
by
armed
men
belonging
to
the
tribunal
and
i
saw
them
push
out
of
the
way
all
who
looked
compassionately
at
him
the
former
were
allowed
to
enter
the
court
of
caiphas
chapter
vii
the
tribunal
of
caiphas
to
enter
caiphas
tribunal
persons
had
to
pass
through
a
large
court
which
may
be
called
the
exterior
court
from
thence
they
entered
into
an
inner
court
which
extended
all
round
the
building
the
building
itself
was
of
far
greater
length
than
breadth
and
in
the
front
there
was
a
kind
of
open
vestibule
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
columns
of
no
great
height
on
the
fourth
side
the
columns
were
higher
and
behind
them
was
a
room
almost
as
large
as
the
vestibule
itself
where
the
seat
of
the
members
of
the
council
were
placed
on
a
species
of
round
platform
raised
above
the
level
of
the
floor
that
assigned
to
the
high
priest
was
elevated
above
the
others
the
criminal
to
be
tried
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
halfcircle
formed
by
the
seats
the
witnesses
and
accusers
stood
either
by
the
side
or
behind
the
prisoner
there
were
three
doors
at
the
back
of
the
judges
seats
which
led
into
another
apartment
filled
likewise
with
seats
this
room
was
used
for
secret
consultation
entrances
placed
on
the
right
and
left
hand
sides
of
this
room
opened
into
the
interior
court
which
was
round
like
the
back
of
the
building
those
who
left
the
room
by
the
door
on
the
righthand
side
saw
on
the
side
of
the
court
the
gate
which
led
to
a
subterranean
prison
excavated
under
the
room
there
were
many
underground
prisons
there
and
it
was
in
one
of
these
that
peter
and
john
were
confined
a
whole
night
when
they
had
cured
the
lame
man
in
the
temple
after
pentecost
both
the
house
and
the
courts
were
filled
with
torches
and
lamps
which
made
them
as
light
as
day
there
was
a
large
fire
lighted
in
the
middle
of
the
porch
on
each
side
of
which
were
hollow
pipes
to
serve
as
chimneys
for
the
smoke
and
round
this
fire
were
standing
soldiers
menial
servants
and
witnesses
of
the
lowest
class
who
had
received
bribes
for
giving
their
false
testimony
a
few
women
were
there
likewise
whose
employment
was
to
pour
out
a
species
of
red
beverage
for
the
soldiers
and
to
bake
cakes
for
which
services
they
received
a
small
compensation
the
majority
of
the
judges
were
already
seated
around
caiphas
the
others
came
in
shortly
afterwards
and
the
porch
was
almost
filled
between
true
and
false
witnesses
while
many
other
persons
likewise
endeavoured
to
come
in
to
gratify
their
curiosity
but
were
prevented
peter
and
john
entered
the
outer
court
in
the
dress
of
travellers
a
short
time
before
jesus
was
led
through
and
john
succeeded
in
penetrating
into
the
inner
court
by
means
of
a
servant
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
the
door
was
instantly
closed
after
him
therefore
peter
who
was
a
little
behind
was
shut
out
he
begged
the
to
open
the
door
for
him
but
she
refused
both
his
entreaties
and
those
of
john
and
he
must
have
remained
on
the
outside
had
not
nicodemus
and
joseph
of
arimathea
who
came
up
at
this
moment
taken
him
with
them
the
two
apostles
then
returned
the
cloaks
which
they
had
borrowed
and
stationed
themselves
in
a
place
from
whence
they
could
see
the
judges
and
hear
everything
that
was
going
on
caiphas
was
seated
in
the
centre
of
the
raised
platform
and
seventy
of
the
members
of
the
sanhedrin
were
placed
around
him
while
the
public
officers
the
scribes
and
the
ancients
were
standing
on
either
side
and
the
false
witnesses
behind
them
soldiers
were
posted
from
the
base
of
the
platform
to
the
door
of
the
vestibule
through
which
jesus
was
to
enter
the
countenance
of
caiphas
was
solemn
in
the
extreme
but
the
gravity
was
accompanied
by
unmistakable
signs
of
suppressed
rage
and
sinister
intentions
he
wore
a
long
mantle
of
a
dull
red
colour
embroidered
in
flowers
and
trimmed
with
golden
fringe
it
was
fastened
at
the
shoulders
and
on
the
chest
besides
being
ornamented
in
the
front
with
gold
clasps
his
was
high
and
adorned
with
hanging
ribbons
the
sides
were
open
and
it
rather
resembled
a
bishop
mitre
caiphas
had
been
waiting
with
his
adherents
belonging
to
the
great
council
for
some
time
and
so
impatient
was
he
that
he
arose
several
times
went
into
the
outer
court
in
his
magnificent
dress
and
asked
angrily
whether
jesus
of
nazareth
was
come
when
he
saw
the
procession
drawing
near
he
returned
to
his
seat
chapter
viii
jesus
before
caiphas
jesus
was
led
across
the
court
and
the
mob
received
him
with
groans
and
hisses
as
he
passed
by
peter
and
john
he
looked
at
them
but
without
turning
his
head
for
fear
of
betraying
them
scarcely
had
he
reached
the
than
caiphas
exclaimed
in
a
loud
tone
art
come
then
at
last
thou
enemy
of
god
thou
blasphemer
who
dost
disturb
the
peace
of
this
holy
night
the
tube
which
contained
the
accusations
of
annas
and
was
fastened
to
the
pretended
sceptre
in
the
hands
of
jesus
was
instantly
opened
and
read
caiphas
made
use
of
the
most
insulting
language
and
the
archers
again
struck
and
abused
our
lord
vociferating
at
the
same
time
at
once
speak
out
art
thou
dumb
caiphas
whose
temper
was
indescribably
proud
and
arrogant
became
even
more
enraged
than
annas
had
been
and
asked
a
thousand
questions
one
after
the
other
but
jesus
stood
before
him
in
silence
and
with
his
eyes
cast
down
the
archers
endeavoured
to
force
him
to
speak
by
repeated
blows
and
a
malicious
child
pressed
his
thumb
into
his
lips
tauntingly
bidding
him
to
bite
the
witnesses
were
then
called
for
the
first
were
persons
of
the
lowest
class
whose
accusations
were
as
incoherent
and
inconsistent
as
those
brought
forward
at
the
court
of
annas
and
nothing
could
be
made
out
of
them
caiphas
therefore
turned
to
the
principal
witnesses
the
pharisees
and
the
sadducees
who
had
assembled
from
all
parts
of
the
country
they
endeavoured
to
speak
calmly
but
their
faces
and
manner
betrayed
the
virulent
envy
and
hatred
with
which
their
hearts
were
overflowing
and
they
repeated
over
and
over
again
the
same
accusations
to
which
he
had
already
replied
so
many
times
he
cured
the
sick
and
cast
out
devils
by
the
help
of
devils
that
he
profaned
the
sabbath
incited
the
people
to
rebel
called
the
pharisees
a
race
of
vipers
and
adulterers
predicted
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
frequented
the
society
of
publicans
and
sinners
assembled
the
people
and
gave
himself
out
as
a
king
a
prophet
and
the
son
of
god
they
deposed
he
was
constantly
speaking
of
his
kingdom
that
he
forbade
divorce
called
himself
the
bread
of
life
and
said
that
whoever
did
not
eat
his
flesh
and
drink
his
blood
would
not
have
eternal
life
thus
did
they
distort
and
misinterpret
the
words
he
had
uttered
the
instructions
he
had
given
and
the
parables
by
which
he
had
illustrated
his
instructions
giving
them
the
semblance
of
crimes
but
these
witnesses
could
not
agree
in
their
depositions
for
one
said
calls
himself
king
and
a
second
instantly
contradicted
saying
he
allows
persons
to
call
him
so
but
directly
they
attempted
to
proclaim
him
he
fled
another
said
calls
himself
the
son
of
god
but
he
was
interrupted
by
a
fourth
who
exclaimed
he
only
styles
himself
the
son
of
god
because
he
does
the
will
of
his
heavenly
father
some
of
the
witnesses
stated
that
he
had
cured
them
but
that
their
diseases
had
returned
and
that
his
pretended
cures
were
only
performed
by
magic
they
spoke
likewise
of
the
cure
of
the
paralytic
man
at
the
pool
of
bethsaida
but
they
distorted
the
facts
so
as
to
give
them
the
semblance
of
crimes
and
even
in
these
accusations
they
could
not
agree
contradicting
one
another
the
pharisees
of
sephoris
with
whom
he
had
once
had
a
discussion
on
the
subject
of
divorces
accused
him
of
teaching
false
doctrines
and
a
young
man
of
nazareth
whom
he
had
refused
to
allow
to
become
one
of
his
disciples
was
likewise
base
enough
to
bear
witness
against
him
it
was
found
to
be
utterly
impossible
to
prove
a
single
fact
and
the
witnesses
appeared
to
come
forward
for
the
sole
purpose
of
insulting
jesus
rather
than
to
demonstrate
the
truth
of
their
statements
whilst
they
were
disputing
with
one
another
caiphas
and
some
of
the
other
members
of
the
council
employed
themselves
in
questioning
jesus
and
turning
his
answers
into
derision
species
of
king
art
thou
give
proofs
of
thy
power
call
the
legions
of
angels
of
whom
thou
didst
speak
in
the
garden
of
olives
what
hast
thou
done
with
the
money
given
unto
thee
by
the
widows
and
other
simpletons
whom
thou
didst
seduce
by
thy
false
doctrines
answer
at
once
speak
out
art
thou
dumb
thou
wouldst
have
been
far
wiser
to
have
kept
silence
when
in
the
midst
of
the
foolish
mob
there
thou
didst
speak
far
too
much
all
these
questions
were
accompanied
by
blows
from
the
of
the
members
of
the
tribunal
and
had
our
lord
not
been
supported
from
above
he
could
not
have
survived
this
treatment
some
of
the
base
witnesses
endeavoured
to
prove
that
he
was
an
illegitimate
son
but
others
declared
that
his
mother
was
a
pious
virgin
belonging
to
the
temple
and
that
they
afterwards
saw
her
betrothed
to
a
man
who
feared
god
the
witnesses
upbraided
jesus
and
his
disciples
with
not
having
offered
sacrifice
in
the
temple
it
is
true
that
i
never
did
see
either
jesus
or
his
disciples
offer
any
sacrifice
in
the
temple
excepting
the
paschal
lamb
but
joseph
and
anna
used
frequently
during
their
lifetime
to
offer
sacrifice
for
the
child
jesus
however
even
this
accusation
was
puerile
for
the
essenians
never
offered
sacrifice
and
no
one
thought
the
less
well
of
them
for
not
doing
so
the
enemies
of
jesus
still
continued
to
accuse
him
of
being
a
sorcerer
and
caiphas
affirmed
several
times
that
the
confusion
in
the
statements
of
the
witnesses
was
caused
solely
by
witchcraft
some
said
that
he
had
eaten
the
paschal
lamb
on
the
previous
day
which
was
contrary
to
the
law
and
that
the
year
before
he
had
made
different
alterations
in
the
manner
of
celebrating
this
ceremony
but
the
witnesses
contradicted
one
another
to
such
a
degree
that
caiphas
and
his
adherents
found
to
their
very
great
annoyance
and
anger
that
not
one
accusation
could
be
really
proved
nicodemus
and
joseph
of
arimathea
were
called
up
and
being
commanded
to
say
how
it
happened
that
they
had
allowed
him
to
eat
the
pasch
on
the
wrong
day
in
a
room
which
belonged
to
them
they
proved
from
ancient
documents
that
from
time
immemorial
the
galileans
had
been
allowed
to
eat
the
pasch
a
day
earlier
than
the
rest
of
the
jews
they
added
that
every
other
part
of
the
ceremony
had
been
performed
according
to
the
directions
given
in
the
law
and
that
persons
belonging
to
the
temple
were
present
at
the
supper
this
quite
puzzled
the
witnesses
and
nicodemus
increased
the
rage
of
the
enemies
of
jesus
by
pointing
out
the
passages
in
the
archives
which
proved
the
right
of
the
galileans
and
gave
the
reason
for
which
this
privilege
was
granted
the
reason
was
this
the
sacrifices
would
not
have
been
finished
by
the
sabbath
if
the
immense
multitudes
who
congregated
together
for
that
purpose
had
all
been
obliged
to
perform
the
ceremony
on
the
same
day
and
although
the
galileans
had
not
always
profited
by
this
right
yet
its
existence
was
incontestably
proved
by
nicodemus
and
the
anger
of
the
pharisees
was
heightened
by
his
remarking
that
the
members
of
the
council
had
cause
to
be
greatly
offended
at
the
gross
contradictions
in
the
statements
of
the
witnesses
and
that
the
extraordinary
and
hurried
manner
in
which
the
whole
affair
had
been
conducted
showed
that
malice
and
envy
were
the
sole
motives
which
induced
the
accusers
and
made
them
bring
the
case
forward
at
a
moment
when
all
were
busied
in
the
preparations
for
the
most
solemn
feast
of
the
year
they
looked
at
nicodemus
furiously
and
could
not
reply
but
continued
to
question
the
witnesses
in
a
still
more
precipitate
and
imprudent
manner
two
witnesses
at
last
came
forward
who
said
man
said
i
will
destroy
this
temple
made
with
hands
and
within
three
days
i
will
build
another
not
made
with
hands
however
even
these
witnesses
did
not
agree
in
their
statements
for
one
said
that
the
accused
wished
to
build
a
new
temple
and
that
he
had
eaten
the
pasch
in
an
unusual
place
because
he
desired
the
destruction
of
the
ancient
temple
but
the
other
said
so
the
edifice
where
he
ate
the
pasch
was
built
by
human
hands
therefore
he
could
not
have
referred
to
that
the
wrath
of
caiphas
was
indescribable
for
the
cruel
treatment
which
jesus
had
suffered
his
divine
patience
and
the
contradiction
of
the
witnesses
were
beginning
to
make
a
great
impression
on
many
persons
present
a
few
hisses
were
heard
and
the
hearts
of
some
were
so
touched
that
they
could
not
silence
the
voice
of
their
consciences
ten
soldiers
left
the
court
under
pretext
of
indisposition
but
in
reality
overcome
by
their
feelings
as
they
passed
by
the
place
where
peter
and
john
were
standing
they
exclaimed
silence
of
jesus
of
nazareth
in
the
midst
of
such
cruel
treatment
is
superhuman
it
would
melt
a
heart
of
iron
the
wonder
is
that
the
earth
does
not
open
and
swallow
such
reprobates
as
his
accusers
must
be
but
tell
us
where
must
we
go
the
two
apostles
either
mistrusted
the
soldiers
and
thought
they
were
only
seeking
to
betray
them
or
they
were
fearful
of
being
recognised
by
those
around
and
denounced
as
disciples
of
jesus
for
they
only
made
answer
in
a
melancholy
tone
truth
calls
you
follow
it
and
all
will
come
right
of
itself
the
soldiers
instantly
went
out
of
the
room
and
left
jerusalem
soon
after
they
met
persons
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
who
directed
them
to
the
caverns
which
lay
to
the
south
of
jerusalem
on
the
other
side
of
mount
sion
where
many
of
the
apostles
had
taken
refuge
these
latter
were
at
first
alarmed
at
seeing
strangers
enter
their
but
the
soldiers
soon
dispelled
all
fear
and
gave
them
an
account
of
the
sufferings
of
jesus
the
temper
of
caiphas
which
was
already
perturbed
became
quite
infuriated
by
the
contradictory
statements
of
the
two
last
witnesses
and
rising
from
his
seat
he
approached
jesus
and
said
thou
nothing
to
the
things
which
these
witness
against
thee
jesus
neither
raised
his
head
nor
looked
at
the
high
priest
which
increased
the
anger
of
the
latter
to
the
greatest
degree
and
the
archers
perceiving
this
seized
our
lord
by
the
hair
pulled
his
head
back
and
gave
him
blows
under
the
chin
but
he
still
kept
his
eyes
cast
down
caiphas
raised
his
hands
and
exclaimed
in
an
enraged
tone
adjure
thee
by
the
living
god
that
thou
tell
us
if
thou
be
christ
the
messiah
the
son
of
the
living
god
a
momentary
and
solemn
pause
ensued
then
jesus
in
a
majestic
and
superhuman
voice
replied
hast
said
it
nevertheless
i
say
to
you
hereafter
you
shall
see
the
son
of
man
sitting
on
the
right
hand
of
the
power
of
god
and
coming
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
whilst
jesus
was
pronouncing
these
words
a
bright
light
appeared
to
me
to
surround
him
heaven
was
opened
above
his
head
i
saw
the
eternal
father
but
no
words
from
a
human
pen
can
describe
the
intuitive
view
that
was
then
vouchsafed
me
of
him
i
likewise
saw
the
angels
and
the
prayers
of
the
just
ascending
to
the
throne
of
god
at
the
same
moment
i
perceived
the
yawning
abyss
of
hell
like
a
fiery
meteor
at
the
feet
of
caiphas
it
was
filled
with
horrible
devils
a
slight
gauze
alone
appeared
to
separate
him
from
its
dark
flames
i
could
see
the
demoniacal
fury
with
which
his
heart
was
overflowing
and
the
whole
house
looked
to
me
like
hell
at
the
moment
that
our
lord
pronounced
the
solemn
words
am
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
hell
appeared
to
be
shaken
from
one
extremity
to
the
other
and
then
as
it
were
to
burst
forth
and
inundate
every
person
in
the
house
of
caiphas
with
feelings
of
redoubled
hatred
towards
our
lord
these
things
are
always
shown
to
me
under
the
appearance
of
some
material
object
which
renders
them
less
difficult
of
comprehension
and
impresses
them
in
a
more
clear
and
forcible
manner
on
the
mind
because
we
ourselves
being
material
beings
facts
are
more
easily
illustrated
in
our
regard
if
manifested
through
the
medium
of
the
senses
the
despair
and
fury
which
these
words
produced
in
hell
were
shown
to
me
under
the
appearance
of
a
thousand
terrific
figures
in
different
places
i
remember
seeing
among
other
frightful
things
a
number
of
little
black
objects
like
dogs
with
claws
which
walked
on
their
hind
legs
i
knew
at
the
time
what
kind
of
wickedness
was
indicated
by
this
apparition
but
i
can
not
remember
now
i
saw
these
horrible
phantoms
enter
into
the
bodies
of
the
greatest
part
of
the
bystanders
or
else
place
themselves
on
their
head
or
shoulders
i
likewise
at
this
moment
saw
frightful
spectres
come
out
of
the
sepulchres
on
the
other
side
of
sion
i
believe
they
were
evil
spirits
i
saw
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
temple
many
other
apparitions
which
resembled
prisoners
loaded
with
chains
i
do
not
know
whether
they
were
demons
or
souls
condemned
to
remain
in
some
particular
part
of
the
earth
and
who
were
then
going
to
limbo
which
our
lord
condemnation
to
death
had
opened
to
them
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
explain
these
facts
for
fear
of
scandalising
those
who
have
no
knowledge
of
such
things
but
persons
who
see
feel
them
and
they
often
cause
the
very
hair
to
stand
on
end
on
the
head
i
think
that
john
saw
some
of
these
apparitions
for
i
heard
him
speak
about
them
afterwards
all
whose
hearts
were
not
radically
corrupted
felt
excessively
terrified
at
these
events
but
the
hardened
were
sensible
of
nothing
but
an
increase
of
hatred
and
anger
against
our
lord
caiphas
then
arose
and
urged
on
by
satan
took
up
the
end
of
his
mantle
pierced
it
with
his
knife
and
rent
it
from
one
end
to
the
other
exclaiming
at
the
same
time
in
a
loud
voice
hath
blasphemed
what
further
need
have
we
of
witnesses
behold
now
you
have
heard
the
blasphemy
what
think
you
all
who
were
then
present
arose
and
exclaimed
with
astounding
malignancy
is
guilty
of
death
during
the
whole
of
this
frightful
scene
the
devils
were
in
the
most
tremendous
state
of
excitement
they
appeared
to
have
complete
possession
not
only
of
the
enemies
of
jesus
but
likewise
of
their
partisans
and
cowardly
followers
the
powers
of
darkness
seemed
to
me
to
proclaim
a
triumph
over
the
light
and
the
few
among
the
spectators
whose
hearts
still
retained
a
glimmering
of
light
were
filled
with
such
consternation
that
covering
their
heads
they
instantly
departed
the
witnesses
who
belonged
to
the
upper
classes
were
less
hardened
than
the
others
their
consciences
were
racked
with
remorse
and
they
followed
the
example
given
by
the
persons
mentioned
above
and
left
the
room
as
quickly
as
possible
while
the
rest
crowded
round
the
fire
in
the
vestibule
and
ate
and
drank
after
receiving
full
pay
for
their
services
the
high
priest
then
addressed
the
archers
and
said
deliver
this
king
up
into
your
hands
render
the
blasphemer
the
honours
which
are
his
due
after
these
words
he
retired
with
the
members
of
his
council
into
the
round
room
behind
the
tribunal
which
could
not
be
seen
from
the
vestibule
in
the
midst
of
the
bitter
affliction
which
inundated
the
heart
of
john
his
thoughts
were
with
the
mother
of
jesus
he
feared
that
the
dreadful
news
of
the
condemnation
of
her
son
might
be
communicated
to
her
suddenly
or
that
perhaps
some
enemy
might
give
the
information
in
a
heartless
manner
he
therefore
looked
at
jesus
and
saying
in
a
low
voice
thou
knowest
why
i
leave
thee
went
away
quickly
to
seek
the
blessed
virgin
as
if
he
had
been
sent
by
jesus
himself
peter
was
quite
overcome
between
anxiety
and
sorrow
which
joined
to
fatigue
made
him
chilly
therefore
as
the
morning
was
cold
he
went
up
to
the
fire
where
many
of
the
common
people
were
warming
themselves
he
did
his
best
to
hide
his
grief
in
their
presence
as
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
go
home
and
leave
his
beloved
master
chapter
ix
the
insults
received
by
jesus
in
the
court
of
caiphas
no
sooner
did
caiphas
with
the
other
members
of
the
council
leave
the
tribunal
than
a
crowd
of
miscreants
the
very
scum
of
the
people
surrounded
jesus
like
a
swarm
of
infuriated
wasps
and
began
to
heap
every
imaginable
insult
upon
him
even
during
the
trial
whilst
the
witnesses
were
speaking
the
archers
and
some
others
could
not
restrain
their
cruel
inclinations
but
pulled
out
handfuls
of
his
hair
and
beard
spat
upon
him
struck
him
with
their
fists
wounded
him
with
sticks
and
even
ran
needles
into
his
body
but
when
caiphas
left
the
hall
they
set
no
bounds
to
their
barbarity
they
first
placed
a
crown
made
of
straw
and
the
bark
of
trees
upon
his
head
and
then
took
it
off
saluting
him
at
the
same
time
with
insulting
expressions
like
the
following
the
son
of
david
wearing
the
crown
of
his
father
greater
than
solomon
is
here
this
is
the
king
who
is
preparing
a
wedding
feast
for
his
son
thus
did
they
turn
into
ridicule
those
eternal
truths
which
he
had
taught
under
the
from
of
parables
to
those
whom
he
came
from
heaven
to
save
and
whilst
repeating
these
scoffing
words
they
continued
to
strike
him
with
their
fists
and
sticks
and
to
spit
in
his
face
next
they
put
a
crown
of
reeds
upon
his
head
took
off
his
robe
and
scapular
and
then
threw
an
old
torn
mantle
which
scarcely
reached
his
knees
over
his
shoulders
around
his
neck
they
hung
a
long
iron
chain
with
an
iron
ring
at
each
end
studded
with
sharp
points
which
bruised
and
tore
his
knees
as
he
walked
they
again
pinioned
his
arms
put
a
reed
into
his
hand
and
covered
his
divine
countenance
with
spittle
they
had
already
thrown
all
sorts
of
filth
over
his
hair
as
well
as
over
his
chest
and
upon
the
old
mantle
they
bound
his
eyes
with
a
dirty
rag
and
struck
him
crying
out
at
the
same
time
in
loud
tones
unto
us
o
christ
who
is
he
that
struck
thee
he
answered
not
one
word
but
sighed
and
prayed
inwardly
for
them
after
many
more
insults
they
seized
the
chain
which
was
hanging
on
his
neck
dragged
him
towards
the
room
into
which
the
council
had
withdrawn
and
with
their
stick
forced
him
in
vociferating
at
the
same
time
forward
thou
king
of
straw
show
thyself
to
the
council
with
the
insignia
of
the
regal
honours
we
have
rendered
unto
thee
a
large
body
of
councillors
with
caiphas
at
their
head
were
still
in
the
room
and
they
looked
with
both
delight
and
approbation
at
the
shameful
scene
which
was
enacted
beholding
with
pleasure
the
most
sacred
ceremonies
turned
into
derision
the
pitiless
guards
covered
him
with
mud
and
spittle
and
with
mock
gravity
exclaimed
the
prophetic
unction
the
regal
unction
then
they
impiously
parodied
the
baptismal
ceremonies
and
the
pious
act
of
magdalen
in
emptying
the
vase
of
perfume
on
his
head
canst
thou
presume
they
exclaimed
appear
before
the
council
in
such
a
condition
thou
dost
purify
others
and
thou
art
not
pure
thyself
but
we
will
soon
purify
thee
they
fetched
a
basin
of
dirty
water
which
they
poured
over
his
face
and
shoulders
whilst
they
bent
their
knees
before
him
and
exclaimed
thy
precious
unction
behold
the
spikenard
worth
three
hundred
pence
thou
hast
been
baptised
in
the
pool
of
bethsaida
they
intended
by
this
to
throw
into
ridicule
the
act
of
respect
and
veneration
shown
by
magdalen
when
she
poured
the
precious
ointment
over
his
head
at
the
house
of
the
pharisee
by
their
derisive
words
concerning
his
baptism
in
the
pool
of
bethsaida
they
pointed
out
although
unintentionally
the
resemblance
between
jesus
and
the
paschal
lamb
for
the
lambs
were
washed
in
the
first
place
in
the
pond
near
the
probatica
gate
and
then
brought
to
the
pool
of
bethsaida
where
they
underwent
another
purification
before
being
taken
to
the
temple
to
be
sacrificed
the
enemies
of
jesus
likewise
alluded
to
the
man
who
had
been
infirm
for
years
and
who
was
cured
by
jesus
at
the
pool
of
bethsaida
for
i
saw
this
man
either
washed
or
baptised
there
i
say
either
washed
or
baptised
because
i
do
not
exactly
remember
the
circumstances
they
then
dragged
jesus
round
the
room
before
all
the
members
of
the
council
who
continued
to
address
him
in
reproachful
and
abusive
language
every
countenance
looked
diabolical
and
enraged
and
all
around
was
dark
confused
and
terrified
our
lord
on
the
contrary
was
from
the
moment
that
he
declared
himself
to
be
the
son
of
god
generally
surrounded
with
a
halo
of
light
many
of
the
assembly
appeared
to
have
a
confused
knowledge
of
this
fact
and
to
be
filled
with
consternation
at
perceiving
that
neither
outrages
or
ignominies
could
alter
the
majestic
expression
of
his
countenance
the
halo
which
shone
around
jesus
from
the
moment
he
declared
himself
to
be
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
served
but
to
incite
his
enemies
to
greater
fury
and
yet
it
was
so
resplendent
that
they
could
not
look
at
it
and
i
believe
their
intention
in
throwing
the
dirty
rag
over
his
head
was
to
deaden
its
brightness
chapter
x
the
denial
of
peter
at
the
moment
when
jesus
uttered
the
words
hast
said
it
and
the
high
priest
rent
his
garment
the
whole
room
resounded
with
tumultuous
cries
peter
and
john
who
had
suffered
intensely
during
the
scene
which
had
just
been
enacted
and
which
they
had
been
obliged
to
witness
in
silence
could
bear
the
sight
no
longer
peter
therefore
got
up
to
leave
the
room
and
john
followed
soon
after
the
latter
went
to
the
blessed
virgin
who
was
in
the
house
of
martha
with
the
holy
women
but
peter
love
for
jesus
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
leave
him
his
heart
was
bursting
and
he
wept
bitterly
although
he
endeavoured
to
restrain
and
hide
his
tears
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
remain
in
the
tribunal
as
his
deep
emotion
at
the
sight
of
his
beloved
master
sufferings
would
have
betrayed
him
therefore
he
went
into
the
vestibule
and
approached
the
fire
around
which
soldiers
and
common
people
were
sitting
and
talking
in
the
most
heartless
and
disgusting
manner
concerning
the
sufferings
of
jesus
and
relating
all
that
they
themselves
had
done
to
him
peter
was
silent
but
his
silence
and
dejected
demeanour
made
the
bystanders
suspect
something
the
portress
came
up
to
the
fire
in
the
midst
of
the
conversation
cast
a
bold
glance
at
peter
and
said
also
wast
with
jesus
the
galilean
these
words
startled
and
alarmed
peter
he
trembled
as
to
what
might
ensue
if
he
owned
the
truth
before
his
brutal
companions
and
therefore
answered
quickly
i
know
him
not
got
up
and
left
the
vestibule
at
this
moment
the
cock
crowed
somewhere
in
the
outskirts
of
the
town
i
do
not
remember
hearing
it
but
i
felt
that
is
was
crowing
as
he
went
out
another
looked
at
him
and
said
to
those
who
were
with
her
man
was
also
with
him
and
the
persons
she
addressed
immediately
demanded
of
peter
whether
her
words
were
true
saying
thou
not
one
of
this
man
disciples
peter
was
even
more
alarmed
than
before
and
renewed
his
denial
in
these
words
am
not
i
know
not
the
man
he
left
the
inner
court
and
entered
the
exterior
court
he
was
weeping
and
so
great
was
his
anxiety
and
grief
that
he
did
not
reflect
in
the
least
on
the
words
he
had
just
uttered
the
exterior
court
was
quite
filled
with
persons
and
some
had
climbed
on
to
the
top
of
the
wall
to
listen
to
what
was
going
on
in
the
inner
court
which
they
were
forbidden
to
enter
a
few
of
the
disciples
were
likewise
there
for
their
anxiety
concerning
jesus
was
so
great
that
they
could
not
make
up
their
minds
to
remain
concealed
in
the
caves
of
hinnom
they
came
up
to
peter
and
with
many
tears
questioned
him
concerning
their
loved
master
but
he
was
so
unnerved
and
so
fearful
of
betraying
himself
that
he
briefly
recommended
them
to
go
away
as
it
was
dangerous
to
remain
and
left
them
instantly
he
continued
to
indulge
his
violent
grief
while
they
hastened
to
leave
the
town
i
recognised
among
these
disciples
who
were
about
sixteen
in
number
bartholomew
nathaniel
saturninus
judas
barsabeas
simon
who
was
afterwards
bishop
of
jerusalem
zacheus
and
manahem
the
man
who
was
born
blind
and
cured
by
our
lord
peter
could
not
rest
anywhere
and
his
love
for
jesus
prompted
him
to
return
to
the
inner
court
which
he
was
allowed
to
enter
because
joseph
of
arimathea
and
nicodemus
had
in
the
first
instance
taken
him
in
he
did
not
the
vestibule
but
turned
to
the
right
and
went
towards
the
round
room
which
was
behind
the
tribunal
and
in
which
jesus
was
undergoing
every
possible
insult
and
ignominy
from
his
cruel
enemies
peter
walked
timidly
up
to
the
door
and
although
perfectly
conscious
that
he
was
suspected
by
all
present
of
being
a
partisan
of
jesus
yet
he
could
not
remain
outside
his
love
for
his
master
impelled
him
forward
he
entered
the
room
advanced
and
soon
stood
in
the
very
midst
of
the
brutal
throng
who
were
feasting
their
cruel
eyes
on
the
sufferings
of
jesus
they
were
at
that
moment
dragging
him
ignominiously
backwards
and
forwards
with
the
crown
of
straw
upon
his
head
he
cast
a
sorrowful
and
even
severe
glance
upon
peter
which
cut
him
to
the
heart
but
as
he
was
still
much
alarmed
and
at
that
moment
heard
some
of
the
bystanders
call
out
is
that
man
he
went
back
again
into
the
court
and
seeing
that
the
persons
in
the
vestibule
were
watching
him
came
up
to
the
fire
and
remained
before
it
for
some
time
several
persons
who
had
observed
his
anxious
troubled
countenance
began
to
speak
in
opprobrious
terms
of
jesus
and
one
of
them
said
to
him
also
art
one
of
his
disciples
thou
also
art
a
galilean
thy
very
speech
betrays
thee
peter
got
up
intending
to
leave
the
room
when
a
brother
of
malchus
came
up
to
him
and
said
i
not
see
thee
in
the
garden
with
him
didst
thou
not
cut
off
my
brother
ear
peter
became
almost
beside
himself
with
terror
he
began
to
curse
and
to
swear
he
knew
not
the
man
and
ran
out
of
the
vestibule
into
the
outer
court
the
cock
then
crowed
again
and
jesus
who
at
that
moment
was
led
across
the
court
cast
a
look
of
mingled
compassion
and
grief
upon
his
apostle
this
look
of
our
lord
pierced
peter
to
the
very
heart
it
recalled
to
his
mind
in
the
most
forcible
and
terrible
manner
the
words
addressed
to
him
by
our
lord
on
the
previous
evening
the
cock
crows
twice
thou
shalt
thrice
deny
me
he
had
forgotten
all
his
promises
and
protestations
to
our
lord
that
he
would
die
rather
than
deny
him
he
had
forgotten
the
warning
given
to
him
by
our
lord
but
when
jesus
looked
at
him
he
felt
the
enormity
of
his
fault
and
his
heart
was
nigh
bursting
with
grief
he
had
denied
his
lord
when
that
beloved
master
was
outraged
insulted
delivered
up
into
the
hands
of
unjust
judges
when
he
was
suffering
all
in
patience
and
in
silence
his
feelings
of
remorse
were
beyond
expression
he
returned
to
the
exterior
court
covered
his
face
and
wept
bitterly
all
fear
of
being
recognised
was
over
he
was
ready
to
proclaim
to
the
whole
universe
both
his
fault
and
his
repentance
what
man
will
dare
assert
that
he
would
have
shown
more
courage
than
peter
if
with
his
quick
and
ardent
temperament
he
were
exposed
to
such
danger
trouble
and
sorrow
at
a
moment
too
when
completely
unnerved
between
fear
and
grief
and
exhausted
by
the
sufferings
of
this
sad
night
our
lord
left
peter
to
his
own
strength
and
he
was
weak
like
all
who
forget
the
words
and
pray
that
ye
enter
not
into
temptation
chapter
xi
mary
in
the
house
of
caiphas
the
blessed
virgin
was
ever
united
to
her
divine
son
by
interior
spiritual
communications
she
was
therefore
fully
aware
of
all
that
happened
to
him
she
suffered
with
him
and
joined
in
his
continual
prayer
for
his
murderers
but
her
maternal
feelings
prompted
her
to
supplicate
almighty
god
most
ardently
not
to
suffer
the
crime
to
be
completed
and
to
save
her
son
from
such
dreadful
torments
she
eagerly
desired
to
return
to
him
and
when
john
who
had
left
the
tribunal
at
the
moment
the
frightful
cry
is
guilty
of
death
was
raised
came
to
the
house
of
lazarus
to
see
after
her
and
to
relate
the
particulars
of
the
dreadful
scene
he
had
just
witnessed
she
as
also
magdalen
and
some
of
the
other
holy
women
begged
to
be
taken
to
the
place
where
jesus
was
suffering
john
who
had
only
left
our
saviour
in
order
to
console
her
whom
he
loved
best
next
to
his
divine
master
instantly
acceded
to
their
request
and
conducted
them
through
the
streets
which
were
lighted
up
by
the
moon
alone
and
crowded
with
persons
hastening
to
their
home
the
holy
women
were
closely
veiled
but
the
sobs
which
they
could
not
restrain
made
many
who
passed
by
observe
them
and
their
feelings
were
harrowed
by
the
abusive
epithets
they
overheard
bestowed
upon
jesus
by
those
who
were
conversing
on
the
subject
of
his
arrest
the
blessed
virgin
who
ever
beheld
in
spirit
the
opprobrious
treatment
which
her
dear
son
was
receiving
continued
lay
up
all
these
things
in
her
heart
like
him
she
suffered
in
silence
but
more
than
once
she
became
totally
unconscious
some
disciples
of
jesus
who
were
returning
from
the
hall
of
caiphas
saw
her
fainting
in
the
arms
of
the
holy
women
and
touched
with
pity
stopped
to
look
at
her
compassionately
and
saluted
her
in
these
words
unhappy
mother
hail
mother
of
the
most
holy
one
of
israel
the
most
afflicted
of
all
mothers
mary
raised
her
head
thanked
them
gratefully
and
continued
her
sad
journey
when
in
the
vicinity
of
caiphas
house
their
grief
was
renewed
by
the
sight
of
a
group
of
men
who
were
busily
occupied
under
a
tent
making
the
cross
ready
for
our
lord
crucifixion
the
enemies
of
jesus
had
given
orders
that
the
cross
should
be
prepared
directly
after
his
arrest
that
they
might
without
delay
execute
the
sentence
which
they
hoped
to
persuade
pilate
to
pass
on
him
the
romans
had
already
prepared
the
crosses
of
the
two
thieves
and
the
workmen
who
were
making
that
of
jesus
were
much
annoyed
at
being
obliged
to
labour
at
it
during
the
night
they
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
their
anger
at
this
and
uttered
the
most
frightful
oaths
and
curses
which
pierced
the
heart
of
the
tender
mother
of
jesus
through
and
through
but
she
prayed
for
these
blind
creatures
who
thus
unknowingly
blasphemed
the
saviour
who
was
about
to
die
for
their
salvation
and
prepared
the
cross
for
his
cruel
execution
mary
john
and
the
holy
women
traversed
the
outer
court
attached
to
caiphas
house
they
stopped
under
the
archway
of
a
door
which
opened
into
the
inner
court
mary
heart
was
with
her
divine
son
and
she
desired
most
ardently
to
see
this
door
opened
that
she
might
again
have
a
chance
of
beholding
him
for
she
knew
that
it
alone
separated
her
from
the
prison
where
he
was
confined
the
door
was
at
length
opened
and
peter
rushed
out
his
face
covered
with
his
mantle
wringing
his
hands
and
weeping
bitterly
by
the
light
of
the
torches
he
soon
recognised
john
and
the
blessed
virgin
but
the
sight
of
them
only
renewed
those
dreadful
feelings
of
remorse
which
the
look
of
jesus
had
awakened
in
his
breast
mary
approached
him
instantly
and
said
tell
me
i
entreat
you
what
is
become
of
jesus
my
son
these
words
pierced
his
very
heart
he
could
not
even
look
at
her
but
turned
away
and
again
wrung
his
hands
mary
drew
close
to
him
and
said
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
son
of
john
why
dost
thou
not
answer
me
mother
exclaimed
peter
in
a
dejected
tone
mother
speak
not
to
me
thy
son
is
suffering
more
than
words
can
express
speak
not
to
me
they
have
condemned
him
to
death
and
i
have
denied
him
three
times
john
came
up
to
ask
a
few
more
questions
but
peter
ran
out
of
the
court
as
if
beside
himself
and
did
not
stop
for
a
single
moment
until
he
reached
the
cave
at
mount
olivet
that
cave
on
the
stones
of
which
the
impression
of
the
hands
of
our
saviour
had
been
miraculously
left
i
believe
it
is
the
cave
in
which
adam
took
refuge
to
weep
after
his
fall
the
blessed
virgin
was
inexpressibly
grieved
at
hearing
of
the
fresh
pang
inflicted
on
the
loving
heart
of
her
divine
son
the
pang
of
hearing
himself
denied
by
that
disciple
who
had
first
acknowledged
him
as
the
son
of
the
living
god
she
was
unable
to
support
herself
and
fell
down
on
the
upon
which
the
impression
of
her
feet
and
hands
remains
to
the
present
day
i
have
seen
the
stones
which
are
preserved
somewhere
but
i
can
not
at
this
moment
remember
where
the
door
was
not
again
shut
for
the
crowd
was
dispersing
and
when
the
blessed
virgin
came
to
herself
she
begged
to
be
taken
to
some
place
as
near
as
possible
to
her
divine
son
john
therefore
led
her
and
the
holy
women
to
the
front
of
the
prison
where
jesus
was
confined
mary
was
with
jesus
in
spirit
and
jesus
was
with
her
but
this
loving
mother
wished
to
hear
with
her
own
ear
the
voice
of
her
divine
son
she
listened
and
heard
not
only
his
moans
but
also
the
abusive
language
of
those
around
him
it
was
impossible
for
the
holy
women
to
remain
in
the
court
any
longer
without
attracting
attention
the
grief
of
magdalen
was
so
violent
that
she
was
unable
to
conceal
it
and
although
the
blessed
virgin
by
a
special
grace
from
almighty
god
maintained
a
calm
and
dignified
exterior
in
the
midst
of
her
sufferings
yet
even
she
was
recognised
and
overheard
harsh
words
such
as
these
not
that
the
mother
of
the
galilean
her
son
will
most
certainly
be
executed
but
not
before
the
festival
unless
indeed
he
is
the
greatest
of
criminals
the
blessed
virgin
left
the
court
and
went
up
to
the
fireplace
in
the
vestibule
where
a
certain
number
of
persons
were
still
standing
when
she
reached
the
spot
where
jesus
had
said
that
he
was
the
son
of
god
and
the
wicked
jews
cried
out
is
guilty
of
death
she
again
fainted
and
john
and
the
holy
women
carried
her
away
in
appearance
more
like
a
corpse
than
a
living
person
the
bystanders
said
not
a
word
they
seemed
struck
with
astonishment
and
silence
such
as
might
have
been
produced
in
hell
by
the
passage
of
a
celestial
being
reigned
in
that
vestibule
the
holy
women
again
passed
the
place
where
the
cross
was
being
prepared
the
workmen
appeared
to
find
as
much
difficulty
in
completing
it
as
the
judges
had
found
in
pronouncing
sentence
and
were
obliged
to
fetch
fresh
wood
every
moment
for
some
bits
would
not
fit
and
others
split
this
continued
until
the
different
species
of
wood
were
placed
in
the
cross
according
to
the
intentions
of
divine
providence
i
saw
angels
who
obliged
these
men
to
recommence
their
work
and
who
would
not
let
them
rest
until
all
was
accomplished
in
a
proper
manner
but
my
remembrance
of
this
vision
is
indistinct
chapter
xii
jesus
confined
in
the
subterranean
prison
the
jews
having
quite
exhausted
their
barbarity
shut
jesus
up
in
a
little
vaulted
prison
the
remains
of
which
subsist
to
this
day
two
of
the
archers
alone
remained
with
him
and
they
were
soon
replaced
by
two
others
he
was
still
clothed
in
the
old
dirty
mantle
and
covered
with
the
spittle
and
other
filth
which
they
had
thrown
over
him
for
they
had
not
allowed
him
to
put
on
his
own
clothes
again
but
kept
his
hands
tightly
bound
together
when
our
lord
entered
this
prison
he
prayed
most
fervently
that
his
heavenly
father
would
accept
all
that
he
had
already
suffered
and
all
that
he
was
about
to
suffer
as
an
expiatory
sacrifice
not
only
for
his
executioners
but
likewise
for
all
who
in
future
ages
might
have
to
suffer
torments
such
as
he
was
about
to
endure
and
be
tempted
to
impatience
or
anger
the
enemies
of
our
lord
did
not
allow
him
a
moment
respite
even
in
this
dreary
prison
but
tied
him
to
a
pillar
which
stood
in
the
centre
and
would
not
allow
him
to
lean
upon
it
although
he
was
so
exhausted
from
ill
treatment
the
weight
of
his
chains
and
his
numerous
falls
that
he
could
scarcely
support
himself
on
his
swollen
and
torn
feet
never
for
a
moment
did
they
cease
insulting
him
and
when
the
first
set
were
tired
out
others
replaced
them
it
is
quite
impossible
to
describe
all
that
the
holy
of
holies
suffered
from
these
heartless
beings
for
the
sight
affected
me
so
excessively
that
i
became
really
ill
and
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
survive
it
we
ought
indeed
to
be
ashamed
of
that
weakness
and
susceptibility
which
renders
us
unable
to
listen
composedly
to
the
descriptions
or
speak
without
repugnance
of
those
sufferings
which
our
lord
endured
so
calmly
and
patiently
for
our
salvation
the
horror
we
feel
is
as
great
as
that
of
a
murderer
who
is
forced
to
place
his
hands
upon
the
wound
he
himself
has
inflicted
on
his
victim
jesus
endured
all
without
opening
his
mouth
and
it
was
man
sinful
man
who
perpetrated
all
these
outrages
against
one
who
was
at
once
their
brother
their
redeemer
and
their
god
i
too
am
a
great
sinner
and
my
sins
cause
these
sufferings
at
the
day
of
judgment
when
the
most
hidden
things
will
be
manifested
we
shall
see
the
share
we
have
had
in
the
torments
endured
by
the
son
of
god
we
shall
see
how
far
we
have
caused
them
by
the
sins
we
so
frequently
commit
and
which
are
in
fact
a
species
of
consent
which
we
give
to
and
a
participation
in
the
tortures
which
were
inflicted
on
jesus
by
his
cruel
enemies
if
alas
we
reflected
seriously
on
this
we
should
repeat
with
much
greater
fervour
the
words
which
we
find
so
often
in
prayer
books
grant
that
i
may
die
rather
than
ever
wilfully
offend
thee
again
by
sin
jesus
continued
to
pray
for
his
enemies
and
they
being
at
last
tired
out
left
him
in
peace
for
a
short
time
when
he
leaned
against
the
pillar
to
rest
and
a
bright
light
shone
around
him
the
day
was
beginning
to
dawn
the
day
of
his
passion
of
our
redemption
and
a
faint
ray
penetrating
the
narrow
of
the
prison
fell
upon
the
holy
and
immaculate
lamb
who
had
taken
upon
himself
the
sins
of
the
world
jesus
turned
towards
the
ray
of
light
raised
his
fettered
hands
and
in
the
most
touching
manner
returned
thanks
to
his
heavenly
father
for
the
dawn
of
that
day
which
had
been
so
long
desired
by
the
prophets
and
for
which
he
himself
had
so
ardently
sighed
from
the
moment
of
his
birth
on
earth
and
concerning
which
he
had
said
to
his
disciples
have
a
baptism
wherewith
i
am
to
be
baptised
and
how
am
i
straitened
until
it
be
accomplished
i
prayed
with
him
but
i
can
not
give
the
words
of
his
prayer
for
i
was
so
completely
overcome
and
touched
to
hear
him
return
thanks
to
his
father
for
the
terrible
sufferings
which
he
had
already
endured
for
me
and
for
the
still
greater
which
he
was
about
to
endure
i
could
only
repeat
over
and
over
with
the
greatest
fervour
i
beseech
thee
give
me
these
sufferings
they
belong
to
me
i
have
deserved
them
in
punishment
for
my
sins
i
was
quite
overwhelmed
with
feelings
of
love
and
compassion
when
i
looked
upon
him
thus
welcoming
the
first
dawn
of
the
great
day
of
his
sacrifice
and
that
ray
of
light
which
penetrated
into
his
prison
might
indeed
be
compared
to
the
visit
of
a
judge
who
wishes
to
be
reconciled
to
a
criminal
before
the
sentence
of
death
which
he
has
pronounced
upon
him
is
executed
the
archers
who
were
dozing
woke
up
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
him
with
surprise
they
said
nothing
but
appeared
to
be
somewhat
astonished
and
frightened
our
divine
lord
was
confined
in
this
prison
an
hour
or
thereabouts
whilst
jesus
was
in
this
dungeon
judas
who
had
been
wandering
up
and
down
the
valley
of
hinnom
like
a
madman
directed
his
step
towards
the
house
of
caiphas
with
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver
the
reward
of
his
treachery
still
hanging
to
his
waist
all
was
silent
around
and
he
addressed
himself
to
some
of
the
sentinels
without
letting
them
know
who
he
was
and
asked
what
was
going
to
be
done
to
the
galilean
has
been
condemned
to
death
and
he
will
certainly
be
crucified
was
the
reply
judas
walked
to
and
fro
and
listened
to
the
different
conversations
which
were
held
concerning
jesus
some
spoke
of
the
cruel
treatment
he
had
received
other
of
his
astonishing
patience
while
others
again
discoursed
concerning
the
solemn
trial
which
was
to
take
place
in
the
morning
before
the
great
council
whilst
the
traitor
was
listening
eagerly
to
the
different
opinions
given
day
dawned
the
members
of
the
tribunal
commenced
their
preparations
and
judas
slunk
behind
the
building
that
he
might
not
be
seen
for
like
cain
he
sought
to
hide
himself
from
human
eyes
and
despair
was
beginning
to
take
possession
of
his
soul
the
place
in
which
he
took
refuge
happened
to
be
the
very
spot
where
the
workmen
had
been
preparing
the
wood
for
making
the
cross
of
our
lord
all
was
in
readiness
and
the
men
were
asleep
by
its
side
judas
was
filled
with
horror
at
the
sight
he
shuddered
and
fled
when
he
beheld
the
instrument
of
that
cruel
death
to
which
for
a
paltry
sum
of
money
he
had
delivered
up
his
lord
and
master
he
ran
to
and
fro
in
perfect
agonies
of
remorse
and
finally
hid
himself
in
an
adjoining
cave
where
he
determined
to
await
the
trial
which
was
to
take
place
in
the
morning
chapter
xiii
the
morning
trial
caiphas
annas
the
ancients
and
the
scribes
assembled
in
the
morning
in
the
great
hall
of
the
tribunal
to
have
a
legal
trial
as
meetings
at
night
were
not
lawful
and
could
only
be
looked
upon
in
the
light
of
preparatory
audiences
the
majority
of
the
members
had
slept
in
the
house
of
caiphas
where
beds
had
been
prepared
for
them
but
some
and
among
them
nicodemus
and
joseph
of
arimathea
had
gone
home
and
returned
at
the
dawn
of
day
the
meeting
was
crowded
and
the
members
commenced
their
operations
in
the
most
hurried
manner
possible
they
wished
to
condemn
jesus
to
death
at
once
but
nicodemus
joseph
and
some
others
opposed
their
wishes
and
demanded
that
the
decision
should
be
deferred
until
after
the
festival
for
fear
of
causing
an
insurrection
among
the
people
maintaining
likewise
that
no
criminal
could
be
justly
condemned
upon
charges
which
were
not
proved
and
that
in
the
case
now
before
them
all
the
witnesses
contradicted
one
another
the
high
priests
and
their
adherents
became
very
angry
and
told
joseph
and
nicodemus
in
plain
terms
that
they
were
not
surprised
at
their
expressing
displeasure
at
what
had
been
done
because
they
were
themselves
partisans
of
the
galilean
and
his
doctrines
and
were
fearful
of
being
convicted
the
high
priest
even
went
so
far
as
to
endeavour
to
exclude
from
the
council
all
those
members
who
were
in
the
lightest
degree
favourable
to
jesus
these
members
protested
that
they
washed
their
hands
of
all
the
future
proceedings
of
the
council
and
leaving
the
room
went
to
the
temple
and
from
this
day
never
again
took
their
seats
in
the
council
caiphas
then
ordered
the
guards
to
bring
jesus
once
more
into
his
presence
and
to
prepare
everything
for
taking
him
to
pilate
court
directly
he
should
have
pronounced
sentence
the
emissaries
of
the
council
hurried
off
to
the
prison
and
with
their
usual
brutality
untied
the
hands
of
jesus
dragged
off
the
old
mantle
which
they
had
thrown
over
his
shoulders
made
him
put
on
his
own
soiled
garment
and
having
fastened
ropes
round
his
waist
dragged
him
out
of
the
prison
the
appearance
of
jesus
when
he
passed
through
the
midst
of
the
crowd
who
were
already
assembled
in
the
front
of
the
house
was
that
of
a
victim
led
to
be
sacrificed
his
countenance
was
totally
changed
and
disfigured
from
and
his
garments
stained
and
torn
but
the
sight
of
his
sufferings
far
from
exciting
a
feeling
of
compassion
in
the
hard
hearted
jews
simply
filled
them
with
disgust
and
increased
their
rage
pity
was
indeed
a
feeling
unknown
in
their
cruel
breasts
caiphas
who
did
not
make
the
slightest
effort
to
conceal
his
hatred
addressed
our
lord
haughtily
in
these
words
thou
be
christ
tell
us
plainly
then
jesus
raised
his
head
and
answered
with
great
dignity
and
calmness
i
shall
tell
you
you
will
not
believe
me
and
if
i
shall
also
ask
you
you
will
not
answer
me
or
let
me
go
but
hereafter
the
son
of
man
shall
be
sitting
on
the
right
hand
of
the
power
of
god
the
high
priests
looked
at
one
another
and
said
to
jesus
with
a
disdainful
laugh
thou
then
the
son
of
god
and
jesus
answered
with
the
voice
of
eternal
truth
say
that
i
am
at
these
words
they
all
exclaimed
need
we
any
further
testimony
for
we
ourselves
have
heard
it
from
his
own
mouth
they
all
arose
instantly
and
vied
with
each
other
as
to
who
should
heap
the
most
abusive
epithets
upon
jesus
whom
they
termed
a
miscreant
who
aspired
to
being
their
messiah
and
pretended
to
be
entitled
to
sit
at
the
right
hand
of
god
they
ordered
the
archers
to
tie
his
hands
again
and
to
fasten
a
chain
round
his
neck
this
was
usually
done
to
criminals
condemned
to
death
and
they
then
prepared
to
conduct
him
to
pilate
hall
where
a
messenger
had
already
been
dispatched
to
beg
him
to
have
all
in
readiness
for
trying
a
criminal
as
it
was
necessary
to
make
no
delay
on
account
of
the
festival
day
the
jewish
priests
murmured
among
themselves
at
being
obliged
to
apply
to
the
roman
governor
for
the
confirmation
of
their
sentence
but
it
was
necessary
as
they
had
not
the
right
of
condemning
criminals
excepting
for
things
which
concerned
religion
and
the
temple
alone
and
they
could
not
pass
a
sentence
of
death
they
wished
to
prove
that
jesus
was
an
enemy
to
the
emperor
and
this
accusation
concerned
those
departments
which
were
under
pilate
jurisdiction
the
soldiers
were
all
standing
in
front
of
the
house
surrounded
by
a
large
body
of
the
enemies
of
jesus
and
of
common
persons
attracted
by
curiosity
the
high
priests
and
a
part
of
the
council
walked
at
the
head
of
the
procession
and
jesus
led
by
archers
and
guarded
by
soldiers
followed
while
the
mob
brought
up
the
rear
they
were
obliged
to
descend
mount
sion
and
cross
a
part
of
the
lower
town
to
reach
palace
and
many
priests
who
had
attended
the
council
went
to
the
temple
directly
afterwards
as
it
was
necessary
to
prepare
for
the
festival
chapter
xiv
the
despair
of
judas
whilst
the
jews
were
conducting
jesus
to
pilate
the
traitor
judas
walked
about
listening
to
the
conversation
of
the
crowd
who
followed
and
his
ears
were
struck
by
words
such
as
these
are
taking
him
before
pilate
the
high
priests
have
condemned
the
galilean
to
death
he
will
be
crucified
they
will
accomplish
his
death
he
has
been
already
dreadfully
illtreated
his
patience
is
wonderful
he
answers
not
his
only
words
are
that
he
is
the
messiah
and
that
he
will
be
seated
at
the
right
hand
of
god
they
will
crucify
him
on
account
of
those
words
had
he
not
said
them
they
could
not
have
condemned
him
to
death
the
miscreant
who
sold
him
was
one
of
his
disciples
and
had
a
short
time
before
eaten
the
paschal
lamb
with
him
not
for
worlds
would
i
have
had
to
do
with
such
an
act
however
guilty
the
galilean
may
be
he
has
not
at
all
events
sold
his
friend
for
money
such
an
infamous
character
as
this
disciple
is
infinitely
more
deserving
of
death
then
but
too
late
anguish
despair
and
remorse
took
possession
of
the
mind
of
judas
satan
instantly
prompted
him
to
fly
he
fled
as
if
a
thousand
furies
were
at
his
heel
and
the
bag
which
was
hanging
at
his
side
struck
him
as
he
ran
and
propelled
him
as
a
spur
from
hell
but
he
took
it
into
his
hand
to
prevent
its
blows
he
fled
as
fast
as
possible
but
where
did
he
fly
not
towards
the
crowd
that
he
might
cast
himself
at
the
feet
of
jesus
his
merciful
saviour
implore
his
pardon
and
beg
do
die
with
him
not
to
confess
his
fault
with
true
repentance
before
god
but
to
endeavour
to
unburden
himself
before
the
world
of
his
crime
and
of
the
price
of
his
treachery
he
ran
like
one
beside
himself
into
the
temple
where
several
members
of
the
council
had
gathered
together
after
the
judgment
of
jesus
they
looked
at
one
another
with
astonishment
and
then
turned
their
haughty
countenances
on
which
a
smile
of
irony
was
visible
upon
judas
he
with
a
frantic
gesture
tore
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver
from
his
side
and
holding
them
forth
with
his
right
hand
exclaimed
in
accents
of
the
most
deep
despair
back
your
silver
that
silver
with
which
you
bribed
me
to
betray
this
just
man
take
back
your
silver
release
jesus
our
compact
is
at
an
end
i
have
sinned
grievously
for
i
have
betrayed
innocent
blood
the
priests
answered
him
in
the
most
contemptuous
manner
and
as
if
fearful
of
contaminating
themselves
by
the
contact
of
the
reward
of
the
traitor
would
not
touch
the
silver
he
tended
but
replied
have
we
to
do
with
thy
sin
if
thou
thinkest
to
have
sold
innocent
blood
it
is
thine
own
affair
we
know
what
we
have
paid
for
and
we
have
judged
him
worthy
of
death
thou
hast
thy
money
say
no
more
they
addressed
these
words
to
him
in
the
abrupt
tone
in
which
men
usually
speak
when
anxious
to
get
rid
of
a
troublesome
person
and
instantly
arose
and
walked
away
these
words
filled
judas
with
such
rage
and
despair
that
he
became
almost
frantic
his
hair
stood
on
end
on
his
head
he
rent
in
two
the
bag
which
contained
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver
cast
them
down
in
the
temple
and
fled
to
the
outskirts
of
the
town
i
again
beheld
him
rushing
to
and
fro
like
a
madman
in
the
valley
of
hinnom
satan
was
by
his
side
in
a
hideous
form
whispering
in
his
ear
to
endeavour
to
drive
him
to
despair
all
the
curses
which
the
prophets
had
hurled
upon
this
valley
where
the
jews
formerly
sacrificed
their
children
to
idols
it
appeared
as
if
all
these
maledictions
were
directed
against
him
as
in
these
words
for
instance
shall
go
forth
and
behold
the
carcases
of
those
who
have
sinned
against
me
whose
worm
dieth
not
and
whore
fires
shall
never
be
extinguished
then
the
devil
murmured
in
his
ears
where
is
thy
brother
abel
what
hast
thou
done
his
blood
cries
to
me
for
vengeance
thou
art
cursed
upon
earth
a
wanderer
for
ever
when
he
reached
the
torrent
of
cedron
and
saw
mount
olivet
he
shuddered
turned
away
and
again
the
words
vibrated
in
his
ear
whereto
art
thou
come
judas
dost
thou
betray
the
son
of
man
with
a
kiss
horror
filled
his
soul
his
head
began
to
wander
and
the
arch
fiend
again
whispered
was
here
that
david
crossed
the
cedron
when
he
fled
from
absalom
absalom
put
an
end
to
his
life
by
hanging
himself
it
was
of
thee
that
david
spoke
when
he
said
and
they
repaid
me
evil
for
good
hatred
for
my
love
may
the
devil
stand
at
his
right
hand
when
he
is
judged
may
he
go
out
condemned
may
his
days
be
few
and
his
bishopric
let
another
take
may
the
iniquity
of
his
father
be
remembered
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
let
not
the
sin
of
his
mother
be
blotted
out
because
he
remembered
not
to
show
mercy
but
persecuted
the
poor
man
and
the
beggar
and
the
broken
in
heart
to
put
him
to
death
and
he
loved
cursing
and
it
shall
come
unto
him
and
he
put
on
cursing
like
a
garment
and
it
went
in
like
water
into
his
entrails
and
like
oil
into
his
bones
may
it
be
unto
him
like
a
garment
which
covereth
him
and
like
a
girdle
with
which
he
is
girded
continually
overcome
by
these
terrible
thoughts
judas
rushed
on
and
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountain
it
was
a
dreary
desolate
spot
filled
with
rubbish
and
putrid
remains
discordant
sounds
from
the
city
reverberated
in
his
ears
and
satan
continually
repeated
are
now
about
to
put
him
to
death
thou
has
sold
him
knowest
thou
not
the
words
of
the
law
he
who
sells
a
soul
among
his
brethren
and
receives
the
price
of
it
let
him
die
the
death
put
an
end
to
thy
misery
wretched
one
put
an
end
to
thy
misery
overcome
by
despair
judas
tore
off
his
girdle
and
hung
himself
on
a
tree
which
grew
in
a
crevice
of
the
rock
and
after
death
his
body
burst
asunder
and
his
bowels
were
scattered
around
chapter
xv
jesus
is
taken
before
pilate
the
malicious
enemies
of
our
saviour
led
him
through
the
most
public
part
of
the
town
to
take
him
before
pilate
the
procession
wended
its
way
slowly
down
the
north
side
of
the
mountain
of
sion
then
passed
through
that
section
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
temple
called
acre
towards
the
palace
and
tribunal
of
pilate
which
were
seated
on
the
side
of
the
temple
facing
a
large
square
caiphas
annas
and
many
others
of
the
chief
council
walked
first
in
festival
attire
they
were
followed
by
a
multitude
of
scribes
and
many
other
jews
among
whom
were
the
false
witnesses
and
the
wicked
pharisees
who
had
taken
the
most
prominent
part
in
accusing
jesus
our
lord
followed
at
a
short
distance
he
was
surrounded
by
a
band
of
soldiers
and
led
by
the
archers
the
multitude
thronged
on
all
sides
and
followed
the
procession
thundering
forth
the
most
fearful
oaths
and
imprecations
while
groups
of
persons
were
hurrying
to
and
fro
pushing
and
jostling
one
another
jesus
was
stripped
of
all
save
his
under
garment
which
was
stained
and
soiled
by
the
filth
which
had
been
flung
upon
it
a
long
chain
was
hanging
round
his
neck
which
struck
his
knees
as
he
walked
his
hands
were
pinioned
as
on
the
previous
day
and
the
archers
dragged
him
by
the
ropes
which
were
fastened
round
his
waist
he
tottered
rather
than
walked
and
was
almost
unrecognisable
from
the
effects
of
his
sufferings
during
the
night
he
was
colourless
haggard
his
face
swollen
and
even
bleeding
and
his
merciless
persecutors
continued
to
torment
him
each
moment
more
and
more
they
had
gathered
together
a
large
body
of
the
dregs
of
the
people
in
order
to
make
his
present
disgraceful
entrance
into
the
city
a
parody
on
his
triumphal
entrance
on
palm
sunday
they
mocked
and
with
derisive
gestures
called
him
king
and
tossed
in
his
path
stones
bits
of
wood
and
filthy
rags
they
made
game
of
and
by
a
thousand
taunting
speeches
mocked
him
during
this
pretended
triumphal
entry
in
the
corner
of
a
building
not
far
from
the
house
of
caiphas
the
afflicted
mother
of
jesus
with
john
and
magdalen
stood
watching
for
him
her
soul
was
ever
united
to
his
but
propelled
by
her
love
she
left
no
means
untried
which
could
enable
her
really
to
approach
him
she
remained
at
the
cenacle
for
some
time
after
her
midnight
visit
to
the
tribunal
of
caiphas
powerless
and
speechless
from
grief
but
when
jesus
was
dragged
forth
from
his
prison
to
be
again
brought
before
his
judges
she
arose
cast
her
veil
and
cloak
about
her
and
said
to
magdalen
and
john
us
follow
my
son
to
pilate
court
i
must
again
look
upon
him
they
went
to
a
place
through
which
the
procession
must
pass
and
waited
for
it
the
mother
of
jesus
knew
that
her
son
was
suffering
dreadfully
but
never
could
she
have
conceived
the
deplorable
the
heartrending
condition
to
which
he
was
reduced
by
the
brutality
of
his
enemies
her
imagination
had
depicted
him
to
her
as
suffering
fearfully
but
yet
supported
and
illuminated
by
sanctity
love
and
patience
now
however
the
sad
reality
burst
upon
her
first
in
the
procession
appeared
the
priests
those
most
bitter
enemies
of
her
divine
son
they
were
decked
in
flowing
robes
but
at
terrible
to
say
instead
of
appearing
resplendent
in
their
character
of
priests
of
the
most
high
they
were
transformed
into
priests
of
satan
for
no
one
could
look
upon
their
wicked
countenances
without
beholding
there
portrayed
in
vivid
colours
the
evil
passions
with
which
their
souls
were
filled
deceit
infernal
cunning
and
a
raging
anxiety
to
carry
out
that
most
tremendous
of
crimes
the
death
of
their
lord
and
saviour
the
only
son
of
god
next
followed
the
false
witnesses
his
perfidious
accusers
surrounded
by
the
vociferating
populace
and
last
of
all
himself
her
son
jesus
the
son
of
god
the
son
of
man
loaded
with
chains
scarcely
able
to
support
himself
but
pitilessly
dragged
on
by
his
infernal
enemies
receiving
blows
from
some
buffets
from
others
and
from
the
whole
assembled
rabble
curses
abuse
and
the
most
scurrilous
language
he
would
have
been
perfectly
unrecognisable
even
to
her
maternal
eyes
stripped
as
he
was
of
all
save
a
torn
remnant
of
his
garment
had
she
not
instantly
marked
the
contrast
between
his
behaviour
and
that
of
his
vile
tormentors
he
alone
in
the
midst
of
persecution
and
suffering
looked
calm
and
resigned
and
far
from
returning
blow
for
blow
never
raised
his
hands
but
in
acts
of
supplication
to
his
eternal
father
for
the
pardon
of
his
enemies
as
he
approached
she
was
unable
to
restrain
herself
any
longer
but
exclaimed
in
thrilling
accents
is
that
my
son
ah
yes
i
see
that
it
is
my
beloved
son
o
jesus
my
jesus
when
the
procession
was
almost
opposite
jesus
looked
upon
her
with
an
expression
of
the
greatest
love
and
compassion
this
look
was
too
much
for
the
heartbroken
mother
she
became
for
the
moment
totally
unconscious
and
john
and
magdalen
endeavoured
to
carry
her
home
but
she
quickly
roused
herself
and
accompanied
the
beloved
disciple
to
pilate
house
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
of
ophel
were
all
gathered
together
in
an
open
space
to
meet
jesus
but
far
from
administering
comfort
they
added
a
fresh
ingredient
to
his
cup
of
sorrow
they
inflicted
upon
him
that
sharp
pang
which
must
ever
be
felt
by
those
who
see
their
friends
abandon
them
in
the
hour
of
adversity
jesus
had
done
much
for
the
inhabitants
of
ophel
but
no
sooner
did
they
see
him
reduced
to
such
a
state
of
misery
and
degradation
than
their
faith
was
shaken
they
could
no
longer
believe
him
to
be
a
king
a
prophet
the
messiah
and
the
son
of
god
the
pharisees
jeered
and
made
game
of
them
on
account
of
the
admiration
they
had
formerly
expressed
for
jesus
at
your
king
now
they
exclaimed
homage
to
him
have
you
no
congratulations
to
offer
him
now
that
he
is
about
to
be
crowned
and
seated
on
his
throne
all
his
boasted
miracles
are
at
an
end
the
high
priest
has
put
an
end
to
his
tricks
and
witchcraft
notwithstanding
the
remembrance
which
these
poor
people
had
of
the
miracles
and
wonderful
cures
which
had
been
performed
under
their
very
eyes
by
jesus
notwithstanding
the
great
benefits
he
had
bestowed
upon
them
their
faith
was
shaken
by
beholding
him
thus
derided
and
pointed
out
as
an
object
of
contempt
by
the
high
priest
and
the
members
of
the
sanhedrin
who
were
regarded
in
jerusalem
with
the
greatest
veneration
some
went
away
doubting
while
others
remained
and
endeavoured
to
join
the
rabble
but
they
were
prevented
by
the
guards
who
had
been
sent
by
the
pharisees
to
prevent
riots
and
confusion

sat
to

a

alone
broke
the

of
this

and
built
on
higher
ground
than
the
adjacent

which
sloped
down
from

the

not
quite
close

separated
by
a

pilate
a
line
traced
on
the
pavement
of
the
court
indicating
the
precise
boundary
beyond
which
they
could
not
pass
without
incurring
defilement
there
was
a
large
parapet
near
the
western
entrance
supported
by
the
sides
of
praetorium
which
formed
a
species
of
porch
between
it
and
the
square
that
part
of
pilate
palace
which
he
made
use
of
when
acting
in
the
capacity
of
judge
was
called
the
praetorium
a
number
of
columns
surrounded
the
parapet
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
and
in
the
centre
was
an
uncovered
portion
containing
an
underground
part
where
the
two
thieves
condemned
to
be
crucified
with
our
lord
were
confined
and
this
part
was
filled
with
roman
soldiers
the
pillar
upon
which
our
lord
was
scourged
was
placed
on
the
forum
itself
not
far
from
this
parapet
and
the
colonnade
there
were
many
other
columns
in
this
place
those
nearest
to
the
palace
were
made
use
of
for
the
infliction
of
various
corporal
punishments
and
the
others
served
as
posts
to
which
were
fastened
the
beasts
brought
for
sale
upon
the
forum
itself
opposite
this
building
was
a
platform
filled
with
seats
made
of
stone
and
from
this
platform
which
was
called
gabbatha
pilate
was
accustomed
to
pronounce
sentence
on
great
criminals
the
marble
staircase
ascended
by
persons
going
to
the
governor
palace
led
likewise
to
an
uncovered
terrace
and
it
was
from
this
terrace
that
pilate
gave
audience
to
the
priests
and
pharisees
when
they
brought
forward
their
accusations
against
jesus
they
all
stood
before
him
in
the
forum
and
refused
to
advance
further
than
the
stone
seats
before
mentioned
a
person
speaking
in
a
loud
tone
of
voice
from
the
terrace
could
be
easily
heard
by
those
in
the
forum
behind
pilate
palace
there
were
many
other
terraces
and
likewise
gardens
and
a
country
house
the
gardens
were
between
the
palace
of
the
governor
and
the
dwelling
of
his
wife
claudia
procles
a
large
moat
separated
these
buildings
from
the
mountain
on
which
the
temple
stood
and
on
this
side
might
be
seen
the
houses
inhabited
by
those
who
served
in
the
temple
the
palace
of
herod
the
elder
was
placed
on
the
eastern
side
of
pilate
palace
and
it
was
in
its
inner
court
that
numbers
of
the
innocents
were
massacred
at
present
the
appearance
of
these
two
buildings
is
a
little
altered
as
their
entrances
are
changed
four
of
the
principal
streets
commenced
at
this
part
of
the
town
and
ran
in
a
southerly
direction
three
leading
to
the
forum
and
pilate
palace
and
the
fourth
to
the
gate
through
which
persons
passed
on
their
way
to
bethsur
the
beautiful
house
which
belonged
to
lazarus
and
likewise
that
of
martha
were
in
a
prominent
part
of
this
street
one
of
these
streets
was
very
near
to
the
temple
and
began
at
the
gate
which
was
called
probatica
the
pool
of
probatica
was
close
to
this
gate
on
the
right
hand
side
and
in
this
pool
the
sheep
were
washed
for
the
first
time
before
being
taken
to
the
temple
while
the
second
and
more
solemn
washing
took
place
in
the
pool
of
bethsaida
which
is
near
the
south
entrance
to
the
temple
the
second
of
the
streets
contained
a
house
belonging
to
anna
the
mother
of
the
blessed
virgin
which
she
usually
inhabited
when
she
came
up
to
jerusalem
with
her
family
to
offer
sacrifice
in
the
temple
i
believe
it
was
in
this
house
that
the
espousals
of
joseph
and
the
blessed
virgin
were
celebrated
the
forum
as
i
have
already
explained
was
built
on
higher
ground
than
the
neighbouring
streets
and
the
aqueducts
which
ran
through
these
streets
flowed
into
the
probatica
pool
on
mount
sion
directly
opposite
to
the
old
castle
of
king
david
stood
a
building
very
similar
to
the
forum
while
to
the
might
be
seen
the
cenacle
and
a
little
towards
the
north
the
tribunals
of
annas
and
caiphas
king
castle
was
a
deserted
fortress
filled
with
courts
empty
rooms
and
stables
generally
let
to
travellers
it
had
long
been
in
this
state
of
ruin
certainly
before
the
time
of
our
lord
nativity
i
saw
the
magi
with
their
numerous
retinue
enter
it
before
going
into
jerusalem
when
in
meditation
i
behold
the
ruins
of
old
castles
and
temples
see
their
neglected
and
forlorn
state
and
reflect
on
the
uses
to
which
they
are
now
put
so
different
from
the
intentions
of
those
who
raised
them
my
mind
always
reverts
to
the
events
of
our
own
days
when
so
many
of
the
beautiful
edifices
erected
by
our
pious
and
zealous
ancestors
are
either
destroyed
defaced
or
used
for
worldly
if
not
wicked
purposes
the
little
church
of
our
convent
in
which
our
lord
deigned
to
dwell
notwithstanding
our
unworthiness
and
which
was
to
me
a
paradise
upon
earth
is
now
without
either
roof
or
windows
and
all
the
monuments
are
effaced
or
carried
away
our
beloved
convent
too
what
will
be
done
with
it
in
a
short
time
that
convent
where
i
was
more
happy
in
my
little
cell
with
my
broken
chair
than
a
king
could
be
on
his
throne
for
from
its
window
i
beheld
that
part
of
the
church
which
contained
the
blessed
sacrament
in
a
few
years
perhaps
no
one
will
know
that
it
ever
existed
no
one
will
know
that
it
once
contained
hundreds
of
souls
consecrated
to
god
who
spent
their
days
in
imploring
his
mercy
upon
sinners
but
god
will
know
all
he
never
forgets
the
past
and
the
future
are
equally
present
to
him
he
it
is
who
reveals
to
me
events
which
took
place
so
long
ago
and
on
the
day
of
judgment
when
all
must
be
accounted
for
and
every
debt
paid
even
to
the
farthing
he
will
remember
both
the
good
and
the
evil
deeds
performed
in
places
long
since
forgotten
with
god
there
is
no
exception
of
persons
or
places
his
eyes
see
all
even
the
vineyard
of
naboth
it
is
a
tradition
among
us
that
our
convent
was
originally
founded
by
two
poor
nuns
whose
worldly
possessions
consisted
in
a
jar
of
oil
and
a
sack
of
beans
on
the
last
day
god
will
reward
them
for
the
manner
in
which
they
put
out
this
small
talent
to
interest
and
for
the
large
harvest
which
they
reaped
and
presented
to
him
it
is
often
said
that
poor
souls
remain
in
purgatory
in
punishment
for
what
appears
to
us
so
small
a
crime
as
not
having
made
restitution
of
a
few
coppers
of
which
they
had
unlawful
possession
may
god
therefore
have
mercy
upon
those
who
have
seized
the
property
of
the
poor
or
of
the
church
chapter
xvii
jesus
before
pilate
it
was
about
eight
in
the
morning
according
to
our
method
of
counting
time
when
the
procession
reached
the
palace
of
pilate
annas
caiphas
and
the
chiefs
of
the
sanhedrin
stopped
at
a
part
between
the
forum
and
the
entrance
to
the
praetorium
where
some
stone
seats
were
placed
for
them
the
brutal
guards
dragged
jesus
to
the
foot
of
the
flight
of
stairs
which
led
to
the
of
pilate
pilate
was
reposing
in
a
comfortable
chair
on
a
terrace
which
overlooked
the
forum
and
a
small
table
stood
by
his
side
on
which
was
placed
the
insignia
of
his
office
and
a
few
other
things
he
was
surrounded
by
officers
and
soldiers
dressed
with
the
magnificence
usual
in
the
roman
army
the
jews
and
the
priests
did
not
enter
the
praetorium
for
fear
of
defiling
themselves
but
remained
outside
when
pilate
saw
the
tumultuous
procession
enter
and
perceived
how
shamefully
the
cruel
jews
had
treated
their
prisoner
he
arose
and
addressed
them
in
a
tone
as
contemptuous
as
could
have
been
assumed
by
a
victorious
general
towards
the
vanquished
chief
of
some
insignificant
village
are
you
come
about
so
early
why
have
you
illtreated
this
prisoner
so
shamefully
is
it
not
possible
to
refrain
from
thus
tearing
to
pieces
and
beginning
to
execute
your
criminals
even
before
they
are
judged
they
made
no
answer
but
shouted
out
to
the
guards
him
on
bring
him
to
be
judged
and
then
turning
to
pilate
they
said
to
our
accusations
against
this
malefactor
for
we
can
not
enter
the
tribunal
lest
we
defile
ourselves
scarcely
had
they
finished
these
words
when
a
voice
was
heard
to
issue
from
the
midst
of
the
dense
multitude
it
proceeded
from
a
old
man
of
imposing
stature
who
exclaimed
are
right
in
not
entering
the
praetorium
for
it
has
been
sanctified
by
the
blood
of
innocents
there
is
but
one
person
who
has
a
right
to
enter
and
who
alone
can
enter
because
he
alone
is
pure
as
the
innocents
who
were
massacred
there
the
person
who
uttered
these
words
in
a
loud
voice
and
then
disappeared
among
the
crowd
was
a
rich
man
of
the
name
of
zadoc
to
obed
the
husband
of
veronica
two
of
his
children
were
among
the
innocents
whom
herod
had
caused
to
be
butchered
at
the
birth
of
our
saviour
since
that
dreadful
moment
he
had
given
up
the
world
and
together
with
his
wife
followed
the
rules
of
the
essenians
he
had
once
seen
our
saviour
at
the
house
of
lazarus
and
there
heard
him
discourse
and
the
sight
of
the
barbarous
manner
in
which
he
was
dragged
before
pilate
recalled
to
his
mind
all
he
himself
had
suffered
when
his
babes
were
so
cruelly
murdered
before
his
eyes
and
he
determined
to
give
this
public
testimony
of
his
belief
in
the
innocence
of
jesus
the
persecutors
of
our
lord
were
far
too
provoked
at
the
haughty
manner
which
pilate
assumed
towards
them
and
at
the
humble
position
they
were
obliged
to
occupy
to
take
any
notice
of
the
words
of
a
stranger
the
brutal
guards
dragged
our
lord
up
the
marble
staircase
and
led
him
to
the
end
of
the
terrace
from
whence
pilate
was
conferring
with
the
jewish
priests
the
roman
governor
had
often
heard
of
jesus
although
he
had
never
seen
him
and
now
he
was
perfectly
astonished
at
the
calm
dignity
of
department
of
a
man
brought
before
him
in
so
pitiable
a
condition
the
inhuman
behaviour
of
the
priests
and
ancients
both
exasperated
him
and
increased
his
contempt
for
them
and
he
informed
them
pretty
quickly
that
the
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
condemning
jesus
without
satisfactory
proofs
of
the
truth
of
their
accusation
accusation
do
you
bring
against
this
man
said
he
addressing
the
priests
in
the
most
scornful
tone
possible
he
were
not
a
malefactor
we
would
not
have
delivered
him
up
to
thee
replied
the
priests
sullenly
him
said
pilate
judge
you
him
according
to
your
law
knowest
well
replied
they
it
is
not
lawful
for
us
to
condemn
any
man
to
death
the
enemies
of
jesus
were
furious
they
wished
to
have
the
trial
finished
off
and
their
victim
executed
as
quickly
as
possible
that
they
might
be
ready
at
the
to
sacrifice
the
paschal
lamb
not
knowing
miserable
wretches
as
they
were
that
he
whom
they
had
dragged
before
the
tribunal
of
an
idolatrous
judge
into
whose
house
they
would
not
enter
for
fear
of
defiling
themselves
before
partaking
of
the
figurative
victim
that
he
and
he
alone
was
the
true
paschal
lamb
of
which
the
other
was
only
the
shadow
pilate
however
at
last
ordered
them
to
produce
their
accusations
these
accusations
were
three
in
number
and
they
brought
forward
ten
witnesses
to
attest
the
truth
of
each
their
great
aim
was
to
make
pilate
believe
that
jesus
was
the
leader
of
a
conspiracy
against
the
emperor
in
order
that
he
might
condemn
him
to
death
as
a
rebel
they
themselves
were
powerless
in
such
matters
being
allowed
to
judge
none
but
religious
offences
their
first
endeavour
was
to
convict
him
of
seducing
the
people
exciting
them
to
rebellion
and
of
being
an
enemy
to
public
peace
and
tranquillity
to
prove
these
charges
they
brought
forward
some
false
witnesses
and
declared
likewise
that
he
violated
the
sabbath
and
even
profaned
it
by
curing
the
sick
upon
that
day
at
this
accusation
pilate
interrupted
them
and
said
in
a
jeering
tone
is
very
evident
you
were
none
of
you
ill
yourselves
had
you
been
so
you
would
not
have
complained
of
being
cured
on
the
seduces
the
people
and
inculcates
the
most
disgusting
doctrines
he
even
says
that
no
person
can
attain
eternal
life
unless
they
eat
his
flesh
and
drink
his
blood
pilate
was
quite
provoked
at
the
intense
hatred
which
their
words
and
countenances
expressed
and
turning
from
them
with
a
look
of
scorn
exclaimed
most
certainly
must
wish
to
follow
his
doctrines
and
to
attain
eternal
life
for
you
are
thirsting
for
both
his
body
and
blood
the
jews
then
brought
forward
the
second
accusation
against
jesus
which
was
that
he
forbad
the
people
to
pay
tribute
to
the
emperor
these
words
roused
the
indignation
of
pilate
as
it
was
his
place
to
see
that
all
the
taxes
were
properly
paid
and
he
exclaimed
in
an
angry
tone
is
a
lie
i
must
know
more
about
it
than
you
this
obliged
the
enemies
of
our
lord
to
proceed
to
the
third
accusation
which
they
did
in
words
such
as
these
this
man
is
of
obscure
birth
he
is
the
chief
of
a
large
party
when
at
their
head
he
denounces
curses
upon
jerusalem
and
relates
parables
of
double
meaning
concerning
a
king
who
is
preparing
a
wedding
feast
for
his
son
the
multitude
whom
he
had
gathered
together
on
a
mountain
endeavoured
once
to
make
him
their
king
but
it
was
sooner
than
he
intended
his
plans
were
not
matured
therefore
he
fled
and
hid
himself
latterly
he
has
come
forward
much
more
it
was
but
the
other
day
that
he
entered
jerusalem
at
the
head
of
a
tumultuous
assembly
who
by
his
orders
made
the
people
rend
the
air
with
acclamations
of
hosanna
to
the
son
of
david
blessed
be
the
empire
of
our
father
david
which
is
now
beginning
he
obliges
his
partisans
to
pay
him
regal
honours
and
tells
them
that
he
is
the
christ
the
anointed
of
the
lord
the
messiah
the
king
promised
to
the
jews
and
he
wishes
to
be
addressed
by
these
fine
titles
then
witnesses
gave
testimony
concerning
these
things
the
last
accusation
that
of
jesus
causing
himself
to
be
called
king
made
some
impression
upon
pilate
he
became
a
little
thoughtful
left
the
terrace
and
casting
a
scrutinising
glance
on
jesus
went
into
the
adjoining
apartment
and
ordered
the
guards
to
bring
him
alone
into
his
presence
pilate
was
not
only
superstitious
but
likewise
extremely
and
susceptible
he
had
often
during
the
course
of
his
pagan
education
heard
mention
made
of
sons
of
his
gods
who
had
dwelt
for
a
time
upon
earth
he
was
likewise
fully
aware
that
the
jewish
prophets
had
long
foretold
that
one
should
appear
in
the
midst
of
them
who
should
be
the
anointed
of
the
lord
their
saviour
and
deliverer
from
slavery
and
that
many
among
the
people
believed
this
firmly
he
remembered
likewise
that
kings
from
the
east
had
come
to
herod
the
predecessor
of
the
present
monarch
of
that
name
to
pay
homage
to
a
king
of
the
jews
and
that
herod
had
on
this
account
given
orders
for
the
massacre
of
the
innocents
he
had
often
heard
of
the
traditions
concerning
the
messiah
and
the
king
of
the
jews
and
even
examined
them
with
some
curiosity
although
of
course
being
a
pagan
without
the
slightest
belief
had
he
believed
at
all
he
would
probably
have
agreed
with
the
herodians
and
with
those
jews
who
expected
a
powerful
and
victorious
king
with
such
impressions
the
idea
of
the
jews
accusing
the
poor
miserable
individual
whom
they
had
brought
into
his
presence
of
setting
himself
up
as
the
promised
king
and
messiah
of
course
appeared
to
him
absurd
but
as
the
enemies
of
jesus
brought
forward
these
charges
in
proof
of
treason
against
the
emperor
he
thought
it
proper
to
interrogate
him
privately
concerning
them
thou
the
king
of
the
jews
said
pilate
looking
at
our
lord
and
unable
to
repress
his
astonishment
at
the
divine
expression
of
his
countenance
jesus
made
answer
thou
this
thing
of
thyself
or
have
others
told
it
thee
of
me
pilate
was
offended
that
jesus
should
think
it
possible
for
him
to
believe
such
a
thing
and
answered
i
a
jew
thy
own
nation
and
the
chief
priests
have
delivered
thee
up
to
me
as
deserving
of
death
what
hast
thou
done
jesus
answered
majestically
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
if
my
kingdom
were
of
this
world
my
servants
would
certainly
strive
that
i
should
not
be
delivered
to
the
jews
but
now
my
kingdom
is
not
from
hence
pilate
was
somewhat
moved
by
these
solemn
words
and
said
to
him
in
a
more
serious
tone
thou
a
king
then
jesus
answered
sayest
that
i
am
a
king
for
this
was
i
born
and
for
this
i
came
into
the
world
that
i
should
give
testimony
to
the
truth
everyone
that
is
of
the
truth
heareth
my
voice
pilate
looked
at
him
and
rising
from
his
seat
said
truth
what
is
truth
they
then
exchanged
a
few
more
words
which
i
do
not
now
remember
and
pilate
returned
to
the
terrace
the
answers
and
deportment
of
jesus
were
far
beyond
his
comprehension
but
he
saw
plainly
that
his
assumption
of
royalty
would
not
clash
with
that
of
the
emperor
for
that
it
was
to
no
worldly
kingdom
that
he
laid
claim
whereas
the
emperor
cared
for
nothing
beyond
this
world
he
therefore
again
addressed
the
chief
priests
from
the
terrace
and
said
find
no
cause
in
him
the
enemies
of
jesus
became
furious
and
uttered
a
thousand
different
accusations
against
our
saviour
but
he
remained
silent
solely
occupied
in
praying
for
his
base
enemies
and
replied
not
when
pilate
addressed
him
in
these
words
thou
nothing
behold
in
how
many
things
they
accuse
thee
pilate
was
filled
with
astonishment
and
said
see
plainly
that
all
they
allege
is
false
but
his
accusers
whose
anger
continued
to
increase
cried
out
find
no
cause
in
him
is
it
no
crime
to
incite
the
people
to
revolt
in
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
to
spread
his
false
doctrines
not
only
here
but
in
galilee
likewise
the
mention
of
galilee
made
pilate
pause
he
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
asked
this
man
a
galilean
and
a
subject
of
herod
they
made
answer
is
his
parents
lived
at
nazareth
and
his
present
dwelling
is
in
capharnaum
that
is
the
case
replied
pilate
him
before
herod
he
is
here
for
the
festival
and
can
judge
him
at
once
as
he
is
his
subject
jesus
was
immediately
led
out
of
the
tribunal
and
pilate
dispatched
an
officer
to
herod
to
inform
him
that
jesus
of
nazareth
who
was
his
subject
was
about
to
be
brought
to
him
to
be
judged
pilate
had
two
reasons
for
following
this
line
of
conduct
in
the
first
place
he
was
delighted
to
escape
having
to
pass
sentence
himself
as
he
felt
very
uncomfortable
about
the
whole
affair
and
in
the
second
place
he
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
pleasing
herod
with
whom
he
had
had
a
disagreement
for
he
knew
him
to
be
very
curious
to
see
jesus
the
enemies
of
our
lord
were
enraged
at
being
thus
dismissed
by
pilate
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
multitude
and
gave
vent
to
their
anger
by
him
even
more
than
before
they
pinioned
him
afresh
and
then
ceased
not
overwhelming
him
with
curses
and
blows
as
they
led
him
hurriedly
through
the
crowd
towards
the
palace
of
herod
which
was
situated
at
no
great
distance
from
the
forum
some
roman
soldiers
had
joined
the
procession
during
the
time
of
the
trial
claudia
procles
the
wife
of
pilate
had
sent
him
frequent
messages
to
intimate
that
she
wished
extremely
to
speak
to
him
and
when
jesus
was
sent
to
herod
she
placed
herself
on
a
balcony
and
watched
the
cruel
conduct
of
his
enemies
with
mingled
feelings
of
fear
grief
and
horror
chapter
xviii
the
origin
of
the
way
of
the
cross
during
the
whole
of
the
scene
which
we
have
just
described
the
mother
of
jesus
with
magdalen
and
john
had
stood
in
a
recess
in
the
forum
they
were
overwhelmed
with
the
most
bitter
sorrow
which
was
but
increased
by
all
they
heard
and
saw
when
jesus
was
taken
before
herod
john
led
the
blessed
virgin
and
magdalen
over
the
parts
which
had
been
sanctified
by
his
footsteps
they
again
looked
at
the
house
of
caiphas
that
of
annas
ophel
gethsemani
and
the
garden
of
olives
they
stopped
and
contemplated
each
spot
where
he
had
fallen
or
where
he
had
suffered
particularly
and
they
wept
silently
at
the
thought
of
all
he
had
undergone
the
blessed
virgin
knelt
down
frequently
and
kissed
the
ground
where
her
son
had
fallen
while
magdalen
wrung
her
hands
in
bitter
grief
and
john
although
he
could
not
restrain
his
own
tears
endeavoured
to
console
his
companions
supported
and
led
them
on
thus
was
the
holy
devotion
of
the
of
the
cross
first
practised
thus
were
the
mysteries
of
the
passion
of
jesus
first
honoured
even
before
that
passion
was
accomplished
and
the
blessed
virgin
that
model
of
spotless
purity
was
the
first
to
show
forth
the
deep
veneration
felt
by
the
church
for
our
dear
lord
how
sweet
and
consoling
to
follow
this
immaculate
mother
passing
to
and
fro
and
bedewing
the
sacred
spots
with
her
tears
but
ah
who
can
describe
the
sharp
sharp
sword
of
grief
which
then
transfixed
her
tender
soul
she
who
had
once
borne
the
saviour
of
the
world
in
her
chaste
womb
and
suckled
him
for
so
long
she
who
had
truly
conceived
him
who
was
the
word
of
god
in
god
from
all
eternity
and
truly
god
she
beneath
whose
heart
full
of
grace
he
had
deigned
to
dwell
nine
months
who
had
felt
him
living
within
her
before
he
appeared
among
men
to
impart
the
blessing
of
salvation
and
teach
them
his
heavenly
doctrines
she
suffered
with
jesus
sharing
with
him
not
only
the
sufferings
of
his
bitter
passion
but
likewise
that
ardent
desire
of
redeeming
fallen
man
by
an
ignominious
death
which
consumed
him
in
this
touching
manner
did
the
most
pure
and
holy
virgin
lay
the
foundation
of
the
devotion
called
the
way
of
the
cross
thus
at
each
station
marked
by
the
sufferings
of
her
son
did
she
lay
up
in
her
heart
the
inexhaustible
merits
of
his
passion
and
gather
them
up
as
precious
stones
or
flowers
to
be
presented
as
a
choice
offering
to
the
eternal
father
in
behalf
of
all
true
believers
the
grief
of
magdalen
was
so
intense
as
to
make
her
almost
like
an
insane
person
the
holy
and
boundless
love
she
felt
for
our
lord
prompted
her
to
cast
herself
at
his
feet
and
there
pour
forth
the
feelings
of
her
heart
as
she
once
poured
the
precious
ointment
on
his
head
as
he
sat
at
table
but
when
on
the
point
of
following
this
impulse
a
dark
gulf
appeared
to
intervene
between
herself
and
him
the
repentance
she
felt
for
her
faults
was
immense
and
not
less
intense
was
her
gratitude
for
their
pardon
but
when
she
longed
to
offer
acts
of
love
and
thanksgiving
as
precious
incense
at
the
feet
of
jesus
she
beheld
him
betrayed
suffering
and
about
to
die
for
the
expiation
of
her
offences
which
he
had
taken
upon
himself
and
this
sight
filled
her
with
horror
and
almost
rent
her
soul
asunder
with
feelings
of
love
repentance
and
gratitude
the
sight
of
the
ingratitude
of
those
for
whom
he
was
about
to
die
increased
the
bitterness
of
these
feelings
tenfold
and
every
step
word
or
movement
demonstrated
the
agony
of
her
soul
the
heart
of
john
was
filled
with
love
and
he
suffered
intensely
but
he
uttered
not
a
word
he
supported
the
mother
of
his
beloved
master
in
this
her
first
pilgrimage
through
the
stations
of
the
way
of
the
cross
and
assisted
her
in
giving
the
example
of
that
devotion
which
has
since
been
practised
with
so
much
fervour
by
the
members
of
the
christian
church
chapter
xix
pilate
and
his
wife
whilst
the
jews
were
leading
jesus
to
herod
i
saw
pilate
go
to
his
wife
claudia
procles
she
hastened
to
meet
him
and
they
went
together
into
a
small
which
was
on
one
of
the
terraces
behind
the
palace
claudia
appeared
to
be
much
excited
and
under
the
influence
of
fear
she
was
a
tall
woman
although
extremely
pale
her
hair
was
plaited
and
slightly
ornamented
but
partly
covered
by
a
long
veil
which
fell
gracefully
over
her
shoulders
she
wore
earrings
a
necklace
and
her
flowing
dress
was
drawn
together
and
held
up
by
a
species
of
clasp
she
conversed
with
pilate
for
a
long
time
and
entreated
him
by
all
that
he
held
sacred
not
to
injure
jesus
that
prophet
that
saint
of
saints
and
she
related
the
extraordinary
dreams
or
visions
which
she
had
had
on
the
previous
night
concerning
him
whilst
she
was
speaking
i
saw
the
greatest
part
of
these
visions
the
following
were
the
most
striking
in
the
first
place
the
principal
events
in
the
life
of
our
lord
the
annunciation
the
nativity
the
adoration
of
the
shepherds
and
that
of
the
kings
the
prophecy
of
simeon
and
that
of
anna
the
flight
into
egypt
the
massacre
of
the
innocents
and
our
lord
temptation
in
the
wilderness
she
had
likewise
been
shown
in
her
sleep
the
most
striking
features
of
the
public
life
of
jesus
he
always
appeared
to
her
environed
with
a
resplendent
light
but
his
malicious
and
cruel
enemies
were
under
the
most
horrible
and
disgusting
forms
imaginable
she
saw
his
intense
sufferings
his
patience
and
his
inexhaustible
love
likewise
the
anguish
of
his
mother
and
her
perfect
resignation
these
visions
filled
the
wife
of
pilate
with
the
greatest
anxiety
and
terror
particularly
as
they
were
accompanied
by
symbols
which
made
her
comprehend
their
meaning
and
her
tender
feelings
were
harrowed
by
the
sight
of
such
dreadful
scenes
she
had
suffered
from
them
during
the
whole
of
the
night
they
were
sometimes
obscure
but
more
often
clear
and
distinct
and
when
morning
dawned
and
she
was
roused
by
the
noise
of
the
tumultuous
mob
who
were
dragging
jesus
to
be
judged
she
glanced
at
the
procession
and
instantly
saw
that
the
unresisting
victim
in
the
midst
of
the
crows
bound
suffering
and
so
inhumanely
treated
as
to
be
scarcely
recognisable
was
no
other
than
that
bright
and
glorious
being
who
had
been
so
often
brought
before
her
eyes
in
the
visions
of
the
past
night
she
was
greatly
affected
by
this
sight
and
immediately
sent
for
pilate
and
gave
him
an
account
of
all
that
had
happened
to
her
she
spoke
with
much
vehemence
and
emotion
and
although
there
was
a
great
deal
in
what
she
had
seen
which
she
could
not
understand
much
less
express
yet
she
entreated
and
implored
her
husband
in
the
most
touching
terms
to
grant
her
request
pilate
was
both
astonished
and
troubled
by
the
words
of
his
wife
he
compared
the
narration
with
all
he
had
previously
heard
concerning
jesus
and
reflected
on
the
hatred
of
the
jews
the
majestic
silence
of
our
saviour
and
the
mysterious
answers
he
had
given
to
all
his
questions
he
hesitated
for
some
time
but
was
at
last
overcome
by
the
entreaties
of
his
wife
and
told
her
that
he
had
already
declared
his
conviction
of
the
innocence
of
jesus
and
that
he
would
not
condemn
him
because
he
saw
that
the
accusations
were
mere
fabrications
of
his
enemies
he
spoke
of
the
words
of
jesus
to
himself
promised
his
wife
that
nothing
should
induce
him
to
condemn
this
just
man
and
even
gave
her
a
ring
before
they
parted
as
a
pledge
of
his
promise
the
character
of
pilate
was
debauched
and
undecided
but
his
worst
qualities
were
an
extreme
pride
and
meanness
which
made
him
never
hesitate
in
the
performance
of
an
unjust
action
provided
it
answered
his
ends
he
was
excessively
superstitious
and
when
in
any
difficulty
had
recourse
to
charms
and
spells
he
was
much
puzzled
and
alarmed
about
the
trial
of
jesus
and
i
saw
him
running
backwards
and
forwards
offering
incense
first
to
one
god
and
then
to
another
and
imploring
them
to
assist
him
but
satan
filled
his
imagination
with
still
greater
confusion
he
first
instilled
one
false
idea
and
then
another
into
his
mind
he
then
had
recourse
to
one
of
his
favourite
superstitious
practices
that
of
watching
the
sacred
chickens
eat
but
in
vain
his
mind
remained
enveloped
in
darkness
and
he
became
more
and
more
undecided
he
first
thought
that
he
would
acquit
our
saviour
whom
he
well
knew
to
be
innocent
but
then
he
feared
incurring
the
wrath
of
his
false
gods
if
he
spared
him
as
he
fancied
he
might
be
a
species
of
demigod
and
obnoxious
to
them
is
possible
said
he
inwardly
this
man
may
really
be
that
king
of
the
jews
concerning
whose
coming
there
are
so
many
prophecies
it
was
a
king
of
the
jews
whom
the
magi
came
from
the
east
to
adore
perhaps
he
is
a
secret
enemy
both
of
our
gods
and
of
the
emperor
it
might
be
most
imprudent
in
me
to
spare
his
life
who
knows
whether
his
death
would
not
be
a
triumph
to
my
gods
then
he
remembered
the
wonderful
dreams
described
to
him
by
his
wife
who
had
never
seen
jesus
and
he
again
changed
and
decided
that
it
would
be
safer
not
to
condemn
him
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
wished
to
pass
a
just
sentence
but
he
deceived
himself
for
when
he
asked
himself
is
the
truth
he
did
not
wait
for
the
answer
his
mind
was
filled
with
confusion
and
he
was
quite
at
a
loss
how
to
act
as
his
sole
desire
was
to
entail
no
risk
upon
himself
chapter
xx
jesus
before
herod
the
palace
of
the
tetrarch
herod
was
built
on
the
north
side
of
the
forum
in
the
new
town
not
very
far
from
that
of
pilate
an
escort
of
roman
soldiers
mostly
from
that
part
of
the
country
which
is
situated
between
switzerland
and
italy
had
joined
the
procession
the
enemies
of
jesus
were
perfectly
furious
at
the
trouble
they
were
compelled
to
take
in
going
backwards
and
forwards
and
therefore
vented
their
rage
upon
him
pilate
messenger
had
preceded
the
procession
consequently
herod
was
expecting
them
he
was
seated
on
a
pile
of
cushions
heaped
together
so
as
to
form
a
species
of
throne
in
a
spacious
hall
and
surrounded
by
courtiers
and
warriors
the
chief
priests
entered
and
placed
themselves
by
his
side
leaving
jesus
at
the
entrance
herod
was
much
elated
and
pleased
at
pilate
having
thus
publicly
acknowledged
his
right
of
judging
the
galileans
and
likewise
rejoiced
at
seeing
that
jesus
who
had
never
deigned
to
appear
before
him
reduced
to
such
a
state
of
humiliation
and
degradation
his
curiosity
had
been
greatly
excited
by
the
high
terms
in
which
john
the
baptist
had
announced
the
coming
of
jesus
and
he
had
likewise
heard
much
about
him
from
the
herodians
and
through
the
many
spies
whom
he
had
sent
into
different
parts
he
was
therefore
delighted
at
this
opportunity
of
interrogating
him
in
the
presence
of
the
courtiers
and
of
the
jewish
priests
hoping
to
make
a
grand
display
of
this
own
knowledge
and
talents
pilate
having
sent
him
word
he
could
find
no
cause
in
the
man
he
concluded
that
these
words
were
intended
as
a
hint
that
he
pilate
wished
the
accusers
to
be
treated
with
contempt
and
mistrust
he
therefore
addressed
them
in
the
most
haughty
distant
manner
possible
and
thereby
increased
their
rage
and
anger
indescribably
they
all
began
at
once
to
vociferate
their
accusations
to
which
herod
hardly
listened
being
intent
solely
on
gratifying
his
curiosity
by
a
close
examination
of
jesus
whom
he
had
so
often
wished
to
see
but
when
he
beheld
him
stripped
of
all
clothing
save
the
remnant
of
a
mantel
scarcely
able
to
stand
and
his
countenance
totally
disfigured
from
the
blows
he
had
received
and
from
the
mud
and
missiles
which
the
rabble
had
flung
at
his
head
the
luxurious
and
effeminate
prince
turned
away
in
disgust
uttered
the
name
of
god
and
said
to
the
priests
in
a
tone
of
mingled
pity
and
contempt
him
hence
and
bring
him
not
back
into
my
presence
in
such
a
deplorable
state
the
guards
took
jesus
into
the
outer
court
and
procured
some
water
in
a
basin
with
which
they
cleansed
his
soiled
garments
and
disfigured
countenance
but
they
could
not
restrain
their
brutality
even
while
doing
this
and
paid
no
regard
to
the
wounds
with
which
he
was
covered
herod
meantime
accosted
the
priests
in
much
the
same
strain
as
pilate
had
done
behaviour
vastly
resembles
that
of
butchers
he
said
you
commence
your
immolations
pretty
early
in
the
morning
the
chief
priests
produced
their
accusations
at
once
herod
when
jesus
was
again
brought
into
his
presence
pretended
to
feel
some
compassion
and
offered
him
a
glass
of
wine
to
recruit
his
strength
but
jesus
turned
his
head
away
and
refused
this
alleviation
herod
then
began
to
expatiate
with
great
volubility
on
all
he
had
heard
concerning
our
lord
he
asked
a
thousand
questions
and
exhorted
him
to
work
a
miracle
in
his
presence
but
jesus
answered
not
a
word
and
stood
before
him
with
his
eyes
cast
down
which
conduct
both
irritated
and
disconcerted
herod
although
he
endeavoured
to
conceal
his
anger
and
continued
his
interrogations
he
at
first
expressed
surprise
and
made
use
of
persuasive
words
it
possible
jesus
of
nazareth
he
exclaimed
it
is
thou
thyself
that
appearest
before
me
as
a
criminal
i
have
heard
thy
actions
so
much
spoken
of
thou
art
not
perhaps
aware
that
thou
didst
offend
me
grievously
by
setting
free
the
prisoners
whom
i
had
confined
at
thirza
but
possibly
thy
intentions
were
good
the
roman
governor
has
now
sent
thee
to
me
to
be
judged
what
answer
canst
thou
give
to
all
these
accusations
thou
art
silent
i
have
heard
much
concerning
thy
wisdom
and
the
religion
thou
teachest
let
me
hear
thee
answer
and
confound
thy
enemies
art
thou
the
king
of
the
jews
art
thou
the
son
of
god
who
art
thou
thou
art
said
to
have
performed
wonderful
miracles
work
one
now
in
my
presence
i
have
the
power
to
release
thee
is
it
true
that
thou
hast
restored
sight
to
the
blind
raised
up
lazarus
from
the
dead
and
fed
two
or
three
thousand
persons
with
a
few
loaves
why
dost
thou
not
answer
i
recommend
thee
to
work
a
miracle
quickly
before
me
perhaps
thou
mayest
rejoice
afterwards
at
having
complied
with
my
wishes
jesus
still
kept
silence
and
herod
continued
to
question
him
with
even
more
volubility
art
thou
said
he
whence
hast
thou
thy
power
how
is
it
that
thou
dost
no
longer
possess
it
art
thou
he
whose
birth
was
foretold
in
such
a
wonderful
manner
kings
from
the
east
came
to
my
father
to
see
a
king
of
the
jews
is
it
true
that
thou
wast
that
child
didst
thou
escape
when
so
many
children
were
massacred
and
how
was
thy
escape
managed
why
hast
thou
been
for
so
many
years
unknown
answer
my
questions
art
thou
a
king
thy
appearance
certainly
is
not
regal
i
have
been
told
that
thou
wast
conducted
to
the
temple
in
triumph
a
short
time
ago
what
was
the
meaning
of
such
an
exhibition
speak
out
at
once
answer
me
herod
continued
to
question
jesus
in
this
rapid
manner
but
our
lord
did
not
vouchsafe
a
reply
i
was
shown
as
indeed
i
already
knew
that
jesus
was
thus
silent
because
herod
was
in
a
state
of
excommunication
both
on
account
of
his
adulterous
marriage
with
herodias
and
of
his
having
given
orders
for
the
execution
of
john
the
baptist
annas
and
caiphas
seeing
how
indignant
herod
was
at
the
silence
of
jesus
immediately
endeavoured
to
take
advantage
of
his
feelings
of
wrath
and
recommenced
their
accusations
saying
that
he
had
called
herod
himself
a
fox
that
his
great
aim
for
many
years
had
been
the
overthrow
of
herod
family
that
he
was
endeavouring
to
establish
a
new
religion
and
had
celebrated
the
pasch
on
the
previous
day
although
herod
was
extremely
enraged
at
the
conduct
of
jesus
he
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
political
ends
which
he
wished
to
forward
he
was
determined
not
to
condemn
our
lord
both
because
he
experienced
a
secret
and
indefinable
sensation
of
terror
in
his
presence
and
because
he
still
felt
remorse
at
the
thought
of
having
put
john
the
baptist
to
death
besides
which
he
detested
the
high
priests
for
not
having
allowed
him
to
take
part
in
the
sacrifices
on
account
of
his
adulterous
connection
with
herodias
but
his
principal
reason
for
determining
not
to
condemn
jesus
was
that
he
wished
to
make
some
return
to
pilate
for
his
courtesy
and
he
thought
the
best
return
would
be
the
compliment
of
showing
deference
to
his
decision
and
agreeing
with
him
in
opinion
but
he
spoke
in
the
most
contemptuous
manner
to
jesus
and
turning
to
the
guards
and
servants
who
surrounded
him
and
who
were
about
two
hundred
in
number
said
away
this
fool
and
pay
him
that
homage
which
is
his
due
he
is
mad
rather
than
guilty
of
any
crime
our
lord
was
immediately
taken
into
a
large
court
where
every
possible
insult
and
indignity
was
heaped
upon
him
this
court
was
between
the
two
wings
of
the
palace
and
herod
stood
a
spectator
on
a
platform
for
some
time
annas
and
caiphas
were
by
his
side
endeavouring
to
persuade
him
to
condemn
our
saviour
but
their
efforts
were
fruitless
and
herod
answered
in
a
tone
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
roman
soldiers
i
should
act
quite
wrongly
if
i
condemned
him
his
meaning
was
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
condemn
as
guilty
one
whom
pilate
had
pronounced
innocent
although
he
had
been
so
courteous
as
to
defer
the
final
judgment
to
him
when
the
high
priests
and
the
other
enemies
of
jesus
perceived
that
herod
was
determined
no
to
give
in
to
their
wishes
they
dispatched
emissaries
to
that
division
of
the
city
called
acre
which
was
chiefly
inhabited
by
pharisees
to
let
them
know
that
they
must
assemble
in
the
neighbourhood
of
pilate
palace
gather
together
the
rabble
and
bribe
them
to
make
a
tumult
and
demand
the
condemnation
of
our
lord
they
likewise
sent
forth
secret
agents
to
alarm
the
people
by
threats
of
the
divine
vengeance
if
they
did
not
insist
on
the
execution
of
jesus
whom
they
termed
a
sacrilegious
blasphemer
these
agents
were
ordered
likewise
to
alarm
them
by
intimating
that
if
jesus
were
not
put
to
death
he
would
go
over
to
the
romans
assist
in
the
extermination
of
the
jewish
nation
for
that
it
was
to
this
he
referred
when
he
spoke
of
his
future
kingdom
they
endeavoured
to
spread
a
report
in
other
parts
of
the
city
that
herod
had
condemned
him
but
still
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
people
likewise
to
express
their
wishes
as
his
partisans
were
to
be
feared
for
that
if
he
were
released
he
would
join
the
romans
make
a
disturbance
on
the
festival
day
and
take
the
most
inhuman
revenge
some
among
them
circulated
contradictory
and
alarming
reports
in
order
to
excite
the
people
and
cause
an
insurrection
while
others
distributed
money
among
the
soldiers
to
bribe
them
to
jesus
so
as
to
cause
his
death
which
they
were
most
anxious
should
be
brought
about
as
quickly
as
possible
lest
pilate
should
acquit
him
whilst
the
pharisees
were
busying
themselves
in
this
manner
our
blessed
saviour
was
suffering
the
greatest
outrages
from
the
brutal
soldiers
to
whom
herod
had
delivered
him
that
they
might
deride
him
as
a
fool
they
dragged
him
into
the
court
and
one
of
their
number
having
procured
a
large
white
sack
which
had
once
been
filled
with
cotton
they
made
a
hole
in
its
centre
with
a
sword
and
then
tossed
it
over
the
head
of
jesus
accompanying
each
action
with
bursts
of
the
most
contemptuous
laughter
another
soldier
brought
the
remnant
of
an
old
scarlet
cloak
and
passed
it
round
his
neck
while
the
rest
bent
their
knee
before
him
shoved
him
abused
him
spat
upon
him
struck
him
on
the
check
because
he
had
refused
to
answer
their
king
mocked
him
by
pretending
to
pay
homage
threw
mud
upon
him
seized
him
by
the
waist
pretending
to
make
him
dance
then
having
thrown
him
down
dragged
him
through
a
gutter
which
ran
on
the
side
of
the
court
thus
causing
his
sacred
head
to
strike
against
the
columns
and
sides
of
the
wall
and
when
at
last
they
raised
him
up
it
was
only
in
order
to
recommence
their
insults
the
soldiers
and
servants
of
herod
who
were
assembled
in
this
court
amounted
to
upwards
of
two
hundred
and
all
thought
to
pay
court
to
their
monarch
by
torturing
jesus
in
some
way
many
were
bribed
by
the
enemies
of
our
lord
to
strike
him
on
the
head
with
their
sticks
and
they
took
advantage
of
the
confusion
and
tumult
to
do
so
jesus
looked
upon
them
with
compassion
excess
of
pain
drew
from
him
occasional
moans
and
groans
but
his
enemies
rejoiced
in
his
sufferings
and
mocked
his
moans
and
not
one
among
the
whole
assembly
showed
the
slightest
degree
of
compassion
i
saw
blood
streaming
from
his
head
and
three
times
did
the
blows
prostrate
him
but
angels
were
weeping
at
his
side
and
they
anointed
his
head
with
heavenly
balsam
it
was
revealed
to
me
that
had
it
not
been
for
this
miraculous
assistance
he
must
have
died
from
those
wounds
the
philistines
at
gaza
who
gave
vent
to
their
wrath
by
tormenting
poor
blind
samson
were
far
less
barbarous
than
these
cruel
executioners
of
our
lord
the
priests
were
however
impatient
to
return
to
the
temple
therefore
having
made
certain
that
their
orders
regarding
jesus
would
be
obeyed
they
returned
to
herod
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
to
condemn
our
lord
but
he
being
determined
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
please
pilate
refused
to
accede
to
their
wishes
and
sent
jesus
back
again
clothed
in
the
fool
garment
chapter
xxi
jesus
led
back
from
the
court
of
herod
to
that
of
pilate
the
enemies
of
jesus
were
perfectly
infuriated
at
being
obliged
to
take
jesus
back
still
uncondemned
to
pilate
who
had
so
many
times
declared
his
innocence
they
led
him
round
by
a
much
longer
road
in
order
in
the
first
place
to
let
the
persons
of
that
part
of
the
town
see
him
in
the
state
of
ignominy
to
which
he
was
reduced
and
in
the
second
place
to
give
their
emissaries
more
time
to
stir
up
the
populace
this
road
was
extremely
rough
and
uneven
and
the
soldiers
encouraged
by
the
pharisees
scarcely
refrained
a
moment
from
tormenting
jesus
the
long
garment
with
which
he
was
clothed
impeded
his
steps
and
caused
him
to
fall
heavily
more
than
once
and
his
cruel
guards
as
also
many
among
the
brutal
populace
instead
of
assisting
him
in
his
state
of
exhaustion
endeavoured
by
blows
and
kicks
to
force
him
to
rise
to
all
these
outrages
jesus
offered
not
the
smallest
resistance
he
prayed
constantly
to
his
father
for
grace
and
strength
that
he
might
not
sink
under
them
but
accomplish
the
work
of
his
passion
for
our
redemption
it
was
about
eight
when
the
procession
reached
the
palace
of
pilate
the
crowd
was
dense
and
the
pharisees
might
be
seen
walking
to
and
fro
endeavouring
to
incite
and
infuriate
them
still
more
pilate
who
remembered
an
insurrection
which
had
taken
place
the
year
before
at
the
paschal
time
had
assembled
upwards
of
a
thousand
soldiers
whom
he
posted
around
the
praetorium
the
forum
and
his
palace
the
blessed
virgin
her
elder
sister
mary
the
daughter
of
heli
mari
the
daughter
of
cleophas
magdalen
and
about
twenty
of
the
holy
women
were
standing
in
a
room
from
whence
they
could
see
all
which
took
place
and
at
first
john
was
with
them
the
pharisees
led
jesus
still
clothed
in
the
fool
garment
through
the
midst
of
the
insolent
mob
and
had
done
all
in
their
power
to
gather
together
the
most
vile
and
wicked
of
miscreants
from
among
the
dregs
of
the
people
a
servant
sent
by
herod
had
already
reached
pilate
with
a
message
to
the
effect
that
his
master
had
fully
appreciated
his
polite
deference
to
his
opinion
but
that
he
looked
upon
the
far
famed
galilean
as
not
better
than
a
fool
that
he
had
treated
him
as
such
and
now
sent
him
back
pilate
was
quite
satisfied
at
finding
that
herod
had
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
himself
and
therefore
returned
a
polite
message
from
that
hour
they
became
friends
having
been
enemies
many
years
in
fact
ever
since
the
of
the
aqueduct
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
between
pilate
and
herod
was
according
to
the
account
of
sister
emmerich
simply
this
pilate
had
undertaken
to
build
an
aqueduct
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
on
which
the
temple
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
torrent
into
which
the
waters
of
the
pool
of
bethsaida
emptied
themselves
and
this
aqueduct
was
to
carry
off
the
refuse
of
the
temple
herod
through
the
medium
of
one
of
his
confidants
who
was
a
member
of
the
sanhedrin
agreed
to
furnish
him
with
the
necessary
materials
as
also
with
architects
who
were
also
herodians
his
aim
was
to
set
the
jews
still
more
against
the
roman
governor
by
causing
the
undertaking
to
fail
he
accordingly
came
to
a
private
understanding
with
the
architects
who
agreed
to
construct
the
aqueduct
in
such
a
manner
that
it
would
be
certain
to
fail
when
the
work
was
almost
finished
and
a
number
of
bricklayers
from
ophel
were
busily
employed
in
removing
the
scaffolding
the
builders
went
on
to
the
top
of
the
tower
of
siloe
to
contemplate
the
crash
which
they
knew
must
take
place
not
only
did
the
whole
of
the
building
crumble
to
pieces
fall
and
kill
workmen
but
even
the
tower
containing
the
architects
came
down
and
not
one
escaped
death
this
accident
occurred
a
short
time
previous
to
the
of
january
two
years
after
jesus
had
commenced
preaching
it
took
place
on
herod
birthday
the
same
day
that
john
the
baptist
was
beheaded
in
the
castle
of
marcherunt
no
roman
officer
attended
these
festivities
on
account
of
the
affair
of
the
aqueduct
although
pilate
had
with
hypocritical
politeness
been
requested
to
take
a
part
in
them
sister
emmerich
saw
some
of
the
disciples
of
jesus
carry
the
news
of
this
event
into
samaria
where
he
was
teaching
on
the
of
january
jesus
went
from
thence
to
hebron
to
comfort
the
family
of
john
and
she
saw
him
on
the
of
january
cure
many
among
the
workmen
of
ophel
who
had
been
injured
by
the
fall
of
the
aqueduct
we
have
seen
by
the
relation
previously
given
how
little
gratitude
they
showed
him
the
enmity
of
herod
towards
pilate
was
still
farther
increased
by
the
manner
in
which
the
latter
revenged
himself
on
the
followers
of
herod
we
will
insert
here
a
few
details
which
were
communicated
at
different
times
to
sister
emmerich
on
the
of
march
of
the
second
year
of
our
lord
preaching
when
jesus
and
his
disciples
were
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bethania
they
were
warned
by
lazarus
that
judas
of
gaulon
intended
to
excite
an
insurrection
against
pilate
on
the
of
march
pilate
issued
a
proclamation
to
the
effect
that
he
intended
to
impose
a
tax
the
proceeds
of
which
were
partly
to
cover
the
expenses
he
had
incurred
in
raising
the
building
which
had
just
fallen
to
the
ground
this
announcement
was
followed
by
a
sedition
headed
by
judas
of
gaulon
who
always
stood
up
for
liberty
and
who
was
unknown
to
himself
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
the
herodians
the
herodians
were
rather
like
our
freemasons
on
the
of
march
at
ten
jesus
dressed
in
a
dark
garment
was
teaching
in
the
temple
with
his
apostles
and
thirty
disciples
the
revolt
of
the
galileans
against
pilate
burst
forth
on
this
very
day
and
the
rebels
set
free
fifty
of
their
number
who
had
been
imprisoned
the
day
before
and
many
among
the
romans
were
killed
on
the
of
april
pilate
caused
the
galileans
to
be
massacred
at
the
moment
of
offering
sacrifice
by
disguised
soldiers
whom
he
had
concealed
in
the
temple
judas
was
killed
with
his
companions
this
massacre
exasperated
herod
still
more
against
pilate
and
we
have
just
seen
by
what
means
their
reconciliation
was
effected
jesus
was
again
led
to
the
house
of
pilate
the
archers
dragged
him
up
the
stairs
with
their
usual
brutality
his
feet
became
entangled
in
his
long
robe
and
he
fell
upon
the
white
marble
steps
which
were
stained
with
blood
from
his
sacred
head
his
enemies
had
again
taken
their
seats
at
the
entrance
of
the
forum
the
mob
laughed
at
his
fall
and
the
archers
truck
their
innocent
victim
instead
of
assisting
him
to
rise
pilate
was
reclining
on
a
species
of
with
a
little
table
before
him
and
surrounded
with
officers
and
persons
who
held
strips
of
parchment
covered
with
writing
in
their
hands
he
came
forward
and
said
to
the
accusers
of
jesus
have
presented
unto
me
this
man
as
one
that
perverteth
the
people
and
behold
i
having
examined
him
before
you
find
no
cause
in
this
man
in
those
things
wherein
you
accuse
him
no
nor
herod
neither
for
i
sent
you
to
him
and
behold
nothing
worthy
of
death
is
done
to
him
i
will
chastise
him
therefore
and
release
him
when
the
pharisees
heard
these
words
they
became
furious
and
endeavoured
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
to
persuade
the
people
to
revolt
distributing
money
among
them
to
effect
this
purpose
pilate
looked
around
with
contempt
and
addressed
them
in
scornful
words
it
happened
to
be
the
precise
time
when
according
to
an
ancient
custom
the
people
had
the
privilege
of
demanding
the
deliverance
of
one
prisoner
the
pharisees
had
dispatched
emissaries
to
persuade
the
people
to
demand
the
death
and
not
the
life
of
our
lord
pilate
hoped
that
they
would
ask
for
jesus
and
determined
to
give
them
to
choose
between
him
and
a
criminal
called
barabbas
who
had
been
convicted
of
a
dreadful
murder
committed
during
a
sedition
as
also
of
many
other
crimes
and
was
moreover
detested
by
the
people
there
was
considerable
excitement
among
the
crowd
a
certain
portion
came
forward
and
their
orators
addressing
pilate
in
a
loud
voice
said
us
the
favour
you
have
always
granted
on
the
festival
day
pilate
made
answer
is
customary
for
me
to
deliver
to
you
a
criminal
at
the
paschal
time
whom
will
you
that
i
release
to
you
barabbas
or
jesus
that
is
called
christ
although
pilate
did
not
in
his
own
mind
feel
at
all
certain
that
jesus
was
the
king
of
the
jews
yet
he
called
him
so
partly
because
his
roman
pride
made
him
take
delight
in
humbling
the
jews
by
calling
such
a
person
their
king
and
partly
because
he
felt
a
kind
of
inward
belief
that
jesus
might
really
be
that
miraculous
king
that
messiah
who
had
been
promised
he
saw
plainly
that
the
priests
were
incited
by
envy
alone
in
their
accusations
against
jesus
this
made
him
most
anxious
to
disappoint
them
and
the
desire
was
increased
by
that
glimmering
of
the
truth
which
partly
enlightened
his
mind
there
was
some
hesitation
among
the
crowd
when
pilate
asked
this
question
and
a
few
voices
answered
a
servant
sent
by
wife
asked
for
him
at
this
moment
he
left
the
platform
and
the
messenger
presented
the
pledge
which
he
had
given
her
saying
at
the
same
time
procles
begs
you
to
remember
your
promise
this
morning
the
pharisees
and
the
priests
walked
anxiously
and
hastily
about
among
the
crowd
threatening
some
and
ordering
others
although
in
fact
little
was
required
to
incite
the
already
infuriated
multitude
mary
with
magdalen
john
and
the
holy
women
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
forum
trembling
and
weeping
for
although
the
mother
of
jesus
was
fully
aware
that
the
redemption
of
man
could
not
be
brought
about
by
any
other
means
than
the
death
of
her
son
yet
she
was
filled
with
the
anguish
of
a
mother
and
with
a
longing
desire
to
save
him
from
those
tortures
and
from
that
death
which
he
was
about
to
suffer
she
prayed
god
not
to
allow
such
a
fearful
crime
to
be
perpetrated
she
repeated
the
words
of
jesus
in
the
garden
of
olives
it
is
possible
let
this
chalice
pass
away
she
still
felt
a
glimmering
of
hope
because
there
was
a
report
current
that
pilate
wished
to
acquit
jesus
groups
of
persons
mostly
inhabitants
of
capharnaum
where
jesus
had
taught
and
among
whom
he
had
wrought
so
many
miraculous
cures
were
congregated
in
her
vicinity
they
pretended
not
to
remember
either
her
or
her
weeping
companions
they
simply
cast
a
glance
now
and
then
as
if
by
chance
at
their
figures
many
thought
as
did
her
companions
likewise
that
these
persons
at
least
would
reject
barabbas
and
beg
for
the
life
of
their
saviour
and
benefactor
but
these
hopes
were
alas
fallacious
pilate
sent
back
the
pledge
to
his
wife
as
an
assurance
of
his
intention
to
keep
his
promise
he
again
came
forward
on
the
platform
and
seated
himself
at
the
little
table
the
chief
priests
took
their
seats
likewise
and
pilate
once
more
demanded
of
the
two
am
i
to
deliver
up
to
you
a
general
cry
resounded
through
the
hall
this
man
but
barabbas
what
am
i
to
do
with
jesus
who
is
called
christ
replied
pilate
all
exclaimed
in
a
tumultuous
manner
him
be
crucified
let
him
be
crucified
what
evil
has
he
done
asked
pilate
for
the
third
time
find
no
cause
in
him
i
will
scourge
and
then
acquit
him
but
the
cry
him
crucify
him
burst
from
the
crowd
and
the
sounds
echoed
like
an
infernal
tempest
the
high
priests
and
the
pharisees
vociferated
and
hurried
backwards
and
forwards
as
if
insane
pilate
at
last
yielded
his
weak
pusillanimous
character
could
not
withstand
such
violent
demonstrations
he
delivered
up
barabbas
to
the
people
and
condemned
jesus
to
be
scourged
chapter
xxii
the
scourging
of
jesus
that
most
weak
and
undecided
of
all
judges
pilate
had
several
times
repeated
these
dastardly
words
find
no
crime
in
him
i
will
chastise
him
therefore
and
let
him
go
to
which
the
jews
had
continued
to
respond
him
crucify
him
but
he
determined
to
adhere
to
his
resolution
of
not
condemning
our
lord
to
death
and
ordered
him
to
be
scourged
according
to
the
manner
of
the
romans
the
guards
were
therefore
ordered
to
conduct
him
through
the
midst
of
the
furious
multitude
to
the
forum
which
they
did
with
the
utmost
brutality
at
the
same
time
loading
him
with
abuse
and
striking
him
with
their
staffs
the
pillar
where
criminals
were
scourged
stood
to
the
north
of
pilate
palace
near
the
and
the
executioners
soon
arrived
carrying
whips
rods
and
ropes
which
they
tossed
down
at
its
base
they
were
six
in
number
dark
swarthy
men
somewhat
shorter
than
jesus
their
chests
were
covered
with
a
piece
of
leather
or
with
some
dirty
stuff
their
loins
were
girded
and
their
hairy
sinewy
arms
bare
they
were
malefactors
from
the
frontiers
of
egypt
who
had
been
condemned
for
their
crimes
to
hard
labour
and
were
employed
principally
in
making
canals
and
in
erecting
public
buildings
the
most
criminal
being
selected
to
act
as
executioners
in
the
praetorium
these
cruel
men
had
many
times
scourged
poor
criminals
to
death
at
this
pillar
they
resembled
wild
beasts
or
demons
and
appeared
to
be
half
drunk
they
struck
our
lord
with
their
fists
and
dragged
him
by
the
cords
with
which
he
was
pinioned
although
he
followed
them
without
offering
the
least
resistance
and
finally
they
barbarously
knocked
him
down
against
the
pillar
this
pillar
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
court
stood
alone
and
did
not
serve
to
sustain
any
part
of
the
building
it
was
not
very
high
for
a
tall
man
could
touch
the
summit
by
stretching
out
his
arm
there
was
a
large
iron
ring
at
the
top
and
both
rings
and
hooks
a
little
lower
down
it
is
quite
impossible
to
describe
the
cruelty
shown
by
these
ruffians
towards
jesus
they
tore
off
the
mantle
with
which
he
had
been
clothed
in
derision
at
the
court
of
herod
and
almost
threw
prostrate
again
jesus
trembled
and
shuddered
as
he
stood
before
the
pillar
and
took
off
his
garments
as
quickly
as
he
could
but
his
hands
were
bloody
and
swollen
the
only
return
he
made
when
his
brutal
executioners
struck
and
abused
him
was
to
pray
for
them
in
the
most
touching
manner
he
turned
his
face
once
towards
his
mother
who
was
standing
overcome
with
grief
this
look
quite
unnerved
her
she
fainted
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
the
holy
women
who
were
there
supported
her
jesus
put
his
arms
round
the
pillar
and
when
his
hands
were
thus
raised
the
archers
fastened
them
to
the
iron
ring
which
was
at
the
top
of
the
pillar
they
then
dragged
his
arms
to
such
a
height
that
his
feet
which
were
tightly
bound
to
the
base
of
the
pillar
scarcely
touched
the
ground
thus
was
the
holy
of
holies
violently
stretched
without
a
particle
of
clothing
on
a
pillar
used
for
the
punishment
of
the
greatest
criminals
and
then
did
two
furious
ruffians
who
were
thirsting
for
his
blood
begin
in
the
most
barbarous
manner
to
scourge
his
sacred
body
from
head
to
foot
the
whips
or
scourges
which
they
first
made
use
of
appeared
to
me
to
be
made
of
a
species
of
flexible
white
wood
but
perhaps
they
were
composed
of
the
sinews
of
the
ox
or
of
strips
of
leather
our
loving
lord
the
son
of
god
true
god
and
true
man
writhed
as
a
worm
under
the
blows
of
these
barbarians
his
mild
but
deep
groans
might
be
heard
from
afar
they
resounded
through
the
air
forming
a
kind
of
touching
accompaniment
to
the
hissing
of
the
instruments
of
torture
these
groans
resembled
rather
a
touching
cry
of
prayer
and
supplication
than
moans
of
anguish
the
clamour
of
the
pharisees
and
the
people
formed
another
species
of
accompaniment
which
at
times
as
a
deafening
deadened
and
smothered
these
sacred
and
mournful
cries
and
in
their
place
might
be
heard
the
words
him
to
death
him
pilate
continued
parleying
with
the
people
and
when
he
demanded
silence
in
order
to
be
able
to
speak
he
was
obliged
to
proclaim
his
wishes
to
the
clamorous
assembly
by
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
and
at
such
moments
you
might
again
hear
the
noise
of
the
scourges
the
moans
of
jesus
the
imprecations
of
the
soldiers
and
the
bleating
of
the
paschal
lambs
which
were
being
washed
in
the
probatica
pool
at
no
great
distance
from
the
forum
there
was
something
peculiarly
touching
in
the
plaintive
bleating
of
these
lambs
they
alone
appeared
to
unite
their
lamentations
with
the
suffering
moans
of
our
lord
the
jewish
mob
was
gathered
together
at
some
distance
from
the
pillar
at
which
the
dreadful
punishment
was
taking
place
and
roman
soldiers
were
stationed
in
different
parts
round
about
many
persons
were
walking
to
and
fro
some
in
silence
others
speaking
of
jesus
in
the
most
insulting
terms
possible
and
a
few
appearing
touched
and
i
thought
i
beheld
rays
of
light
issuing
from
our
lord
and
entering
the
hearts
of
the
latter
i
saw
groups
of
infamous
young
men
who
were
for
the
most
part
busying
themselves
near
the
in
preparing
fresh
scourges
while
others
went
to
seek
branches
of
thorns
several
of
the
servants
of
the
high
priests
went
up
to
the
brutal
executioners
and
gave
them
money
as
also
a
large
jug
filled
with
a
strong
bright
red
liquid
which
quite
inebriated
them
and
increased
their
cruelty
tenfold
towards
their
innocent
victim
the
two
ruffians
continued
to
strike
our
lord
with
unremitting
violence
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
were
then
succeeded
by
two
others
his
body
was
entirely
covered
with
black
blue
and
red
marks
the
blood
was
trickling
down
on
the
ground
and
yet
the
furious
cries
which
issued
from
among
the
assembled
jews
showed
that
their
cruelty
was
far
from
being
satiated
the
night
had
been
extremely
cold
and
the
morning
was
dark
and
cloudy
a
little
hail
had
fallen
which
surprised
everyone
but
towards
twelve
the
day
became
brighter
and
the
sun
shone
forth
the
two
fresh
executioners
commenced
scourging
jesus
with
the
greatest
possible
fury
they
made
use
of
a
different
kind
of
rod
a
species
of
thorny
stick
covered
with
knots
and
splinters
the
blows
from
these
sticks
tore
his
flesh
to
pieces
his
blood
spouted
out
so
as
to
stain
their
arms
and
he
groaned
prayed
and
shuddered
at
this
moment
some
strangers
mounted
on
camels
passed
through
the
forum
they
stopped
for
a
moment
and
were
quite
overcome
with
pity
and
horror
at
the
scene
before
them
upon
which
some
of
the
bystanders
explained
the
cause
of
what
they
witnessed
some
of
these
travellers
had
been
baptised
by
john
and
others
had
heard
the
sermon
of
jesus
on
the
mountain
the
noise
and
the
tumult
of
the
mob
was
even
more
deafening
near
the
house
of
pilate
two
fresh
executioners
took
the
places
of
the
last
mentioned
who
were
beginning
to
flag
their
scourges
were
composed
of
small
chains
or
straps
covered
with
iron
hooks
which
penetrated
to
the
bone
and
tore
off
large
pieces
of
flesh
at
every
blow
what
word
alas
could
describe
this
terrible
this
heartrending
scene
the
cruelty
of
these
barbarians
was
nevertheless
not
yet
satiated
they
untied
jesus
and
again
fastened
him
up
with
his
back
turned
towards
the
pillar
as
he
was
totally
unable
to
support
himself
in
an
upright
position
they
passed
cords
round
his
waist
under
his
arms
and
above
his
knees
and
having
bound
his
hands
tightly
into
the
rings
which
were
placed
at
the
upper
part
of
the
pillar
they
recommenced
scourging
him
with
even
greater
fury
than
before
and
one
among
them
struck
him
constantly
on
the
face
with
a
new
rod
the
body
of
our
lord
was
perfectly
torn
to
shreds
it
was
but
one
wound
he
looked
at
his
torturers
with
his
eyes
filled
with
blood
as
if
entreating
mercy
but
their
brutality
appeared
to
increase
and
his
moans
each
moment
became
more
feeble
the
dreadful
scourging
had
been
continued
without
intermission
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
when
a
stranger
of
lowly
birth
a
relation
to
ctesiphon
the
blind
man
whom
jesus
had
cured
rushed
from
amidst
the
crowd
and
approached
the
pillar
with
a
knife
shaped
like
a
cutlass
in
his
hand
he
exclaimed
in
an
indignant
tone
scourge
not
this
innocent
man
unto
death
the
drunken
miscreants
taken
by
surprise
stopped
short
while
he
quickly
severed
the
cords
which
bound
jesus
to
the
pillar
and
disappeared
among
the
crowd
jesus
fell
almost
without
consciousness
on
the
ground
which
was
bathed
with
his
blood
the
executioners
left
him
there
and
rejoined
their
cruel
companions
who
were
amusing
themselves
in
the
guardhouse
with
drinking
and
plaiting
the
crown
of
thorns
our
lord
remained
for
a
short
time
on
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
pillar
bathed
in
his
own
blood
and
two
or
three
girls
came
up
to
gratify
their
curiosity
away
in
disgust
but
at
the
moment
the
pain
of
the
wounds
of
jesus
was
so
intense
that
he
raised
his
bleeding
head
and
looked
at
them
they
retired
quickly
and
the
soldiers
and
guards
laughed
and
made
game
of
them
during
the
time
of
the
scourging
of
our
lord
i
saw
weeping
angels
approach
him
many
times
i
likewise
heard
the
prayers
he
constantly
addressed
to
his
father
for
the
pardon
of
our
sins
prayers
which
never
ceased
during
the
whole
time
of
the
infliction
of
this
cruel
punishment
whilst
he
lay
bathed
in
his
blood
i
saw
an
angel
present
to
him
a
vase
containing
a
beverage
which
appeared
to
reinvigorate
him
in
a
certain
degree
the
archers
soon
returned
and
after
giving
him
some
blows
with
their
sticks
bade
him
rise
and
follow
them
he
raised
himself
with
the
greatest
difficulty
as
his
trembling
limbs
could
scarcely
support
the
weight
of
this
body
they
did
not
give
him
sufficient
time
to
put
on
his
clothes
but
threw
his
upper
garment
over
his
naked
shoulders
and
led
him
from
the
pillar
to
the
guardhouse
where
he
wiped
the
blood
which
trickled
down
his
face
with
a
corner
of
his
garment
when
he
passed
before
the
benches
on
which
the
high
priests
were
seated
they
cried
out
him
to
death
crucify
him
crucify
him
and
then
turned
away
disdainfully
the
executioners
led
him
into
the
interior
of
the
guardhouse
which
was
filled
with
slaves
archers
hodmen
and
the
very
dregs
of
the
people
but
there
were
no
soldiers
the
great
excitement
among
the
populace
alarmed
pilate
so
much
that
he
sent
to
the
fortress
of
antonia
for
a
reinforcement
of
roman
soldiers
and
posed
these
troops
round
the
they
were
permitted
to
talk
and
to
deride
jesus
in
every
possible
way
but
were
forbidden
to
quit
their
ranks
these
soldiers
whom
pilate
had
sent
for
to
intimidate
the
mob
numbered
about
a
thousand
chapter
xxiii
mary
during
the
scourging
of
our
lord
i
saw
the
blessed
virgin
in
a
continual
ecstasy
during
the
time
of
the
scourging
of
her
divine
son
she
saw
and
suffered
with
inexpressible
love
and
grief
all
the
torments
he
was
enduring
she
groaned
feebly
and
her
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
a
large
veil
covered
her
person
and
she
leant
upon
mary
of
heli
her
eldest
sister
who
was
old
and
extremely
like
their
mother
mary
of
cleophas
the
daughter
of
mary
of
heli
was
there
also
the
friends
of
jesus
and
mary
stood
around
the
latter
they
wore
large
veils
appeared
overcome
with
grief
and
anxiety
an
were
weeping
as
if
in
the
momentary
expectation
of
death
the
dress
of
mary
was
blue
it
was
long
and
partly
covered
by
a
cloak
made
of
white
wool
and
her
veil
was
of
rather
a
yellow
white
magdalen
was
totally
beside
herself
from
grief
and
her
hair
was
floating
loosely
under
her
veil
when
jesus
fell
down
at
the
foot
of
the
pillar
after
the
flagellation
i
saw
claudia
procles
the
wife
of
pilate
sent
some
large
pieces
of
linen
to
the
mother
of
god
i
know
not
whether
she
thought
that
jesus
would
be
set
free
and
that
his
mother
would
then
require
linen
to
dress
his
wounds
or
whether
this
compassionate
lady
was
aware
of
the
use
which
would
be
made
of
her
present
at
the
termination
of
the
scourging
mary
came
to
herself
for
a
time
and
saw
her
divine
son
all
torn
and
mangled
being
led
away
by
the
archers
after
the
scouring
he
wiped
his
eyes
which
were
filled
with
blood
that
he
might
look
at
his
mother
and
she
stretched
out
her
hands
towards
him
and
continued
to
look
at
the
bloody
traces
of
his
footsteps
i
soon
after
saw
mary
and
magdalen
approach
the
pillar
where
jesus
had
been
scourged
the
mob
were
at
a
distance
and
they
were
partly
concealed
by
the
other
holy
women
and
by
a
few
persons
who
had
joined
them
they
knelt
down
on
the
ground
near
the
pillar
and
wiped
up
the
sacred
blood
with
the
linen
which
claudia
procles
had
sent
john
was
not
at
that
time
with
the
holy
women
who
were
about
twenty
in
number
the
sons
of
simeon
and
of
obed
and
veronica
as
also
the
two
nephews
of
joseph
of
arimathea
aram
and
themni
were
in
the
temple
and
appeared
to
be
overwhelmed
with
grief
it
was
not
more
than
nine
when
the
scourging
terminated
chapter
xxiv
interruption
of
the
visions
of
the
passion
by
the
appearance
of
joseph
under
the
form
of
a
child
during
the
whole
time
of
the
visions
which
we
have
just
narrated
that
is
to
say
from
the
of
february
until
the
of
march
sister
emmerich
continued
to
suffer
all
the
mental
and
bodily
tortures
which
were
once
endured
by
our
lord
being
totally
immersed
in
these
meditations
and
as
it
were
dead
to
exterior
objects
she
wept
and
groaned
like
a
person
in
the
hands
of
an
executioner
trembled
shuddered
and
writhed
on
her
couch
while
her
face
resembled
that
of
a
man
about
to
expire
under
torture
and
a
bloody
sweat
often
trickled
over
her
chest
and
shoulders
she
generally
perspired
so
profusely
that
her
bed
and
clothes
were
saturated
her
sufferings
from
thirst
were
likewise
fearful
and
she
might
truly
be
compared
to
a
person
perishing
in
a
desert
from
the
want
of
water
generally
speaking
her
mouth
was
so
parched
in
the
morning
and
her
tongue
so
contracted
and
dried
up
that
she
could
not
speak
but
was
obliged
by
signs
and
inarticulate
sounds
to
beg
for
relief
her
constant
state
of
fever
was
probably
brought
on
by
the
great
pains
she
endured
added
to
which
she
likewise
often
took
upon
herself
the
illnesses
and
temporal
calamities
merited
by
others
it
was
always
necessary
for
her
to
rest
for
a
time
before
relating
the
different
scenes
of
the
passion
nor
was
it
always
that
she
could
speak
of
what
she
had
seen
and
she
was
even
often
obliged
to
discontinue
her
narrations
for
the
day
she
was
in
this
state
of
suffering
on
saturday
the
of
march
and
with
the
greatest
difficulty
and
suffering
described
the
scourging
of
our
lord
which
she
had
seen
in
the
vision
of
the
previous
night
and
which
appeared
to
be
present
to
her
mind
during
the
greatest
part
of
the
following
day
towards
evening
however
a
change
took
place
and
there
was
an
interruption
in
the
course
of
meditations
on
the
passion
which
had
latterly
followed
one
another
so
regularly
we
will
describe
this
interruption
in
order
in
the
first
place
to
give
our
readers
a
more
full
comprehension
of
the
interior
life
of
this
most
extraordinary
person
and
in
the
second
to
enable
them
to
pause
for
a
time
to
rest
their
minds
as
i
well
know
that
meditations
on
the
passion
of
our
lord
exhaust
the
weak
even
when
they
remember
that
it
was
for
their
salvation
that
he
suffered
and
died
the
life
of
sister
emmerich
both
as
regarded
her
spiritual
and
intellectual
existence
invariably
harmonised
with
the
spirit
of
the
church
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
it
harmonised
even
more
strongly
than
man
natural
life
does
with
season
or
with
the
hours
of
the
day
and
this
caused
her
to
be
if
we
may
thus
express
ourselves
a
realisation
of
the
existence
and
of
the
various
intentions
of
the
church
her
union
with
its
spirit
was
so
complete
that
no
sooner
did
a
festival
day
begin
that
is
to
say
on
the
eve
than
a
perfect
change
took
place
within
her
both
intellectually
and
spiritually
as
soon
as
the
spiritual
sun
of
these
festival
days
of
the
church
was
set
she
directed
all
her
thoughts
towards
that
which
would
rise
on
the
following
day
and
disposed
all
her
prayers
good
works
and
sufferings
for
the
attainment
of
the
special
graces
attached
to
the
feast
about
to
commence
like
a
plant
which
absorbs
the
dew
and
revels
in
the
warmth
and
light
of
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
these
changes
did
not
as
will
readily
be
believed
always
take
place
at
the
exact
moment
when
the
sound
of
the
angelus
announced
the
commencement
of
a
festival
and
summoned
the
faithful
to
prayer
for
this
bell
is
often
either
through
ignorance
or
negligence
rung
at
the
wrong
time
but
they
commenced
at
the
time
when
the
feast
really
began
if
the
church
commemorated
a
sorrowful
mystery
she
appeared
depressed
faint
and
almost
powerless
but
the
instant
the
celebration
of
a
joyful
feast
commenced
both
body
and
soul
revived
to
a
new
life
as
if
refreshed
by
the
dew
of
new
graces
and
she
continued
in
this
calm
quiet
and
happy
state
quite
released
from
every
kind
of
suffering
until
the
evening
these
things
took
place
in
her
soul
quite
independently
of
her
will
but
as
she
had
had
from
infancy
the
most
ardent
desire
of
being
obedient
to
jesus
and
to
his
church
god
had
bestowed
upon
her
those
special
graces
which
give
a
natural
facility
for
practising
obedience
every
faculty
of
her
soul
was
directed
towards
the
church
in
the
same
manner
as
a
plant
which
even
if
put
into
a
dark
cellar
naturally
turns
its
leaves
upwards
and
appears
to
seek
the
light
on
saturday
of
march
after
sunset
sister
emmerich
had
with
the
greatest
difficulty
portrayed
the
different
events
of
the
scourging
of
our
lord
and
the
writer
of
these
pages
thought
that
her
mind
was
occupied
in
the
contemplation
of
the
with
thorns
when
suddenly
her
countenance
which
was
preciously
pale
and
haggard
like
that
of
a
person
on
the
point
of
death
became
bright
and
serene
and
she
exclaimed
in
a
coaxing
tone
as
if
speaking
to
a
child
that
dear
little
boy
who
is
he
stay
i
will
ask
him
his
name
is
joseph
he
has
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
to
come
to
me
poor
child
he
is
laughing
he
knows
nothing
at
all
of
what
is
going
on
how
light
his
clothing
is
i
fear
he
must
be
cold
the
air
is
so
sharp
this
morning
wait
my
child
let
me
put
something
more
over
you
after
saying
these
words
in
such
a
natural
tone
of
voice
that
it
was
almost
impossible
for
those
present
not
to
turn
round
and
expect
to
see
the
child
she
held
up
a
dress
which
was
near
her
as
would
be
done
by
a
person
wishing
to
clothe
a
poor
frozen
child
the
friend
who
was
standing
by
her
bedside
had
not
sufficient
time
to
ask
her
to
explain
the
words
she
had
spoken
for
a
sudden
change
took
place
both
in
her
whole
appearance
and
manner
when
her
attendant
pronounced
the
word
obedience
one
of
the
vows
by
which
she
had
consecrated
herself
to
our
lord
she
instantly
came
to
herself
and
like
an
obedient
child
awakening
from
a
sound
sleep
and
starting
up
at
the
voice
of
its
mother
she
stretched
forth
her
hand
took
the
rosary
and
crucifix
which
were
always
at
her
side
arranged
her
dress
rubbed
her
eyes
and
sat
up
she
was
then
carried
from
her
bed
to
a
chair
as
she
could
neither
stand
nor
walk
and
it
being
the
time
for
making
her
bed
her
friend
left
the
room
in
order
to
write
out
what
he
had
heard
during
the
day
on
sunday
the
of
march
the
friend
asked
her
attendant
what
sister
emmerich
meant
the
evening
before
when
she
spoke
of
a
child
called
joseph
the
attendant
answered
spoke
of
him
again
many
times
yesterday
evening
he
is
the
son
of
a
cousin
of
mine
and
a
great
favourite
of
hers
i
fear
that
her
talking
so
much
about
him
is
a
sign
that
he
is
going
to
have
an
illness
for
she
said
so
many
times
that
the
poor
child
was
almost
without
clothing
and
that
he
must
be
cold
the
friend
remembered
having
often
seen
this
little
joseph
playing
on
the
bed
of
sister
emmerich
and
he
supposed
that
she
was
dreaming
about
him
on
the
previous
day
when
the
friend
went
to
see
her
later
in
the
day
to
endeavour
to
obtain
a
continuation
of
the
narrations
of
the
passion
he
found
her
contrary
to
his
expectation
more
calm
and
apparently
better
in
health
than
on
the
previous
day
she
told
him
that
she
had
seen
nothing
more
after
the
scourging
of
our
lord
and
when
he
questioned
her
concerning
what
she
had
said
about
little
joseph
she
could
not
remember
having
spoken
of
the
child
at
all
he
then
asked
the
reason
of
her
being
so
calm
serene
and
apparently
well
in
health
and
she
answered
always
feel
thus
when
comes
for
then
the
church
sings
with
isaias
in
the
introit
at
mass
rejoice
o
jerusalem
and
come
together
all
you
that
love
her
rejoice
with
joy
you
that
have
been
in
sorrow
that
you
may
exult
and
be
filled
from
the
breasts
of
your
consolation
sunday
is
consequently
a
day
of
rejoicing
and
you
may
likewise
remember
that
in
the
gospel
of
this
day
the
church
relates
how
our
lord
fed
five
thousand
men
with
five
loaves
and
two
fishes
of
which
twelve
baskets
of
fragments
remained
consequently
we
ought
to
rejoice
she
likewise
added
that
our
lord
had
deigned
to
visit
her
on
that
day
in
the
holy
communion
and
that
she
always
felt
especial
spiritual
consolation
when
she
received
him
on
that
particular
day
of
the
year
the
friend
cast
his
eyes
on
the
calendar
of
the
diocese
of
munster
and
saw
that
on
that
day
they
not
only
kept
sunday
but
likewise
the
feast
of
joseph
the
of
our
lord
he
was
not
aware
of
this
before
because
in
other
places
the
feast
of
joseph
is
kept
on
the
and
he
remarked
this
circumstance
to
sister
emmerich
and
asked
her
whether
she
did
not
think
that
was
the
cause
of
her
speaking
about
joseph
she
answered
that
she
was
perfectly
aware
of
its
being
the
feast
of
the
of
jesus
but
that
she
had
not
been
thinking
of
the
child
of
that
name
however
a
moment
after
she
suddenly
remembered
what
her
thoughts
had
been
the
day
before
and
explained
to
her
friend
that
the
moment
the
feast
of
joseph
began
her
vision
of
the
sorrowful
mysteries
of
the
passion
ceased
and
were
superseded
by
totally
different
scenes
in
which
joseph
appeared
under
the
form
of
a
child
and
that
it
was
to
him
that
the
words
we
have
mentioned
above
were
addressed
we
found
that
when
she
received
these
communications
the
vision
was
often
in
the
form
of
a
child
especially
in
those
cases
when
an
artist
would
have
made
use
of
that
simile
to
express
his
ideas
if
for
instance
the
accomplishment
of
some
scripture
prophecy
was
being
shown
to
her
she
often
saw
by
the
side
of
the
illustration
a
child
who
clearly
designated
the
characteristics
of
such
or
such
a
prophet
by
his
position
his
dress
and
the
manner
in
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
waved
to
and
fro
the
prophetic
roll
appended
to
a
staff
sometimes
when
she
was
in
extreme
suffering
a
beautiful
child
dressed
in
green
with
a
calm
and
serene
countenance
would
approach
and
seat
himself
in
a
posture
of
resignation
at
the
side
of
her
bed
allowing
himself
to
be
moved
from
one
side
to
the
other
or
even
put
down
on
to
the
ground
without
the
smallest
opposition
and
constantly
looking
at
her
affectionately
and
consoling
her
if
when
quite
prostrate
from
illness
and
the
sufferings
of
others
which
she
had
taken
upon
herself
she
entered
into
communication
with
a
saint
either
by
participation
in
the
celebration
of
his
feast
or
from
his
relics
being
brought
to
her
she
sometimes
saw
passages
of
the
childhood
of
martyrdom
in
her
greatest
sufferings
she
was
usually
consoled
instructed
or
reproved
whichever
the
occasion
called
for
by
apparitions
under
the
form
of
children
sometimes
when
totally
overcome
by
trouble
and
distress
she
would
fall
asleep
and
be
carried
back
in
imagination
to
the
scenes
and
perils
of
her
childhood
she
sometimes
dreamed
as
her
exclamations
and
gestures
demonstrated
that
she
was
once
more
a
little
country
girl
of
five
years
old
climbing
over
a
hedge
caught
in
the
briars
and
weeping
with
fear
these
scenes
of
her
childhood
were
always
events
which
had
really
occurred
and
the
words
which
escaped
her
showed
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
she
would
exclaim
as
if
repeating
the
words
of
others
do
you
call
out
so
will
not
hold
the
hedge
back
until
you
are
quiet
and
ask
me
gently
to
do
so
she
had
obeyed
this
injunction
when
she
was
a
child
and
caught
in
the
hedge
and
she
followed
the
same
rule
when
grown
up
and
suffering
from
the
most
terrible
trials
she
often
spoke
and
joked
about
the
thorn
hedge
and
the
patience
and
prayer
which
had
then
been
recommended
to
her
which
admonition
she
in
had
frequently
neglected
but
which
had
never
failed
her
when
she
had
recourse
to
it
this
symbolical
coincidence
of
the
events
of
her
childhood
with
those
of
her
riper
years
shows
that
in
the
individual
no
less
than
in
humanity
at
large
prophetic
types
may
be
found
but
to
the
individual
as
well
as
to
mankind
in
general
a
divine
type
has
been
given
in
the
person
of
our
redeemer
in
order
that
both
the
one
and
the
other
by
walking
in
his
footsteps
and
with
his
assistance
may
surpass
human
nature
and
attain
to
perfect
wisdom
and
grace
with
god
and
man
thus
it
is
that
the
will
of
god
is
done
on
earth
as
in
heaven
and
that
this
kingdom
is
attained
by
of
good
will
she
then
gave
a
short
account
of
the
visions
which
had
on
the
previous
night
interrupted
her
visions
of
the
passion
at
the
commencement
of
the
feast
of
joseph
chapter
xxv
description
of
the
personal
appearance
of
the
blessed
virgin
while
these
sad
events
were
taking
place
i
was
in
jerusalem
sometimes
in
one
locality
and
sometimes
in
another
i
was
quite
overcome
my
sufferings
were
intense
and
i
felt
as
if
about
to
expire
during
the
time
of
the
scourging
of
my
adorable
spouse
i
sat
in
the
vicinity
in
a
part
which
no
jew
dared
approach
for
fear
of
defiling
himself
but
i
did
not
fear
defilement
i
was
only
anxious
for
a
drop
of
our
lord
blood
to
fall
upon
me
to
purify
me
i
felt
so
completely
heartbroken
that
i
thought
i
must
die
as
i
could
not
relieve
jesus
and
each
blow
which
he
received
drew
from
me
such
sobs
and
moans
that
i
felt
quite
astonished
at
not
being
driven
away
when
the
executioners
took
jesus
into
the
guardhouse
to
crown
him
with
thorns
i
longed
to
follow
that
i
might
again
contemplate
him
in
his
sufferings
then
it
was
that
the
mother
of
jesus
accompanied
by
the
holy
women
approached
the
pillar
and
wiped
up
the
blood
with
which
it
and
the
ground
around
were
saturated
the
door
of
the
guardhouse
was
open
and
i
heard
the
brutal
laughter
of
the
heartless
men
who
were
busily
employed
in
finishing
off
the
crown
of
thorns
which
they
had
prepared
for
our
lord
i
was
too
much
affected
to
weep
but
i
endeavoured
to
drag
myself
near
to
the
place
where
our
lord
was
to
be
crowned
with
thorns
i
once
more
saw
the
blessed
virgin
her
countenance
was
wan
and
pale
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
but
the
simple
dignity
of
her
demeanour
can
not
be
described
notwithstanding
her
grief
and
anguish
notwithstanding
the
fatigue
which
she
had
endured
for
she
had
been
wandering
ever
since
the
previous
evening
through
the
streets
of
jerusalem
and
across
the
valley
of
josaphat
her
appearance
was
placid
and
modest
and
not
a
fold
of
her
dress
out
of
place
she
looked
majestically
around
and
her
veil
fell
gracefully
over
her
shoulders
she
moved
quietly
and
although
her
heart
was
a
prey
to
the
most
bitter
grief
her
countenance
was
calm
and
resigned
her
dress
was
moistened
by
the
dew
which
had
fallen
upon
it
during
the
night
and
by
the
tears
which
she
had
shed
in
such
abundance
otherwise
it
was
totally
unsoiled
her
beauty
was
great
but
indescribable
for
it
was
a
mixture
of
majesty
sanctity
simplicity
and
purity
the
appearance
of
mary
magdalen
was
totally
different
she
was
taller
and
more
robust
the
expression
of
her
countenance
showed
greater
determination
but
its
beauty
was
almost
destroyed
by
the
strong
passions
which
she
had
so
long
indulged
and
by
the
violent
repentance
and
grief
she
had
since
felt
it
was
painful
to
look
upon
her
she
was
the
very
picture
of
despair
her
long
dishevelled
hair
was
partly
covered
by
her
torn
and
wet
veil
and
her
appearance
was
that
of
one
completely
absorbed
by
woe
and
almost
beside
herself
from
sorrow
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
magdalum
were
standing
near
gazing
at
her
with
surprise
and
curiosity
for
they
had
known
her
in
former
days
first
in
prosperity
and
afterwards
in
degradation
and
consequent
misery
they
pointed
they
even
cast
mud
upon
her
but
she
saw
nothing
knew
nothing
and
felt
nothing
save
her
agonising
grief
chapter
xxvi
the
crowning
with
thorns
no
sooner
did
sister
emmerich
recommence
the
narrative
of
her
visions
on
the
passion
than
she
again
became
extremely
ill
oppressed
with
fever
and
so
tormented
by
violent
thirst
that
her
tongue
was
perfectly
parched
and
contracted
and
on
the
monday
after
sunday
she
was
so
exhausted
that
it
was
not
without
great
difficulty
and
after
many
intervals
of
rest
that
she
narrated
all
which
our
lord
suffered
in
this
crowning
with
thorns
she
was
scarcely
able
to
speak
because
she
herself
felt
every
sensation
which
she
described
in
the
following
account
pilate
harangued
the
populace
many
times
during
the
time
of
the
scourging
of
jesus
but
they
interrupted
him
once
and
vociferated
shall
be
executed
even
if
we
die
for
it
when
jesus
was
led
into
the
guardhouse
they
all
cried
out
again
him
crucify
him
after
this
there
was
silence
for
a
time
pilate
occupied
himself
in
giving
different
orders
to
the
soldiers
and
the
servants
of
the
high
priests
brought
them
some
refreshments
after
which
pilate
whose
superstitious
tendencies
made
him
uneasy
in
mind
went
into
the
inner
part
of
his
palace
in
order
to
consult
his
gods
and
to
offer
them
incense
when
the
blessed
virgin
and
the
holy
women
had
gathered
up
the
blood
of
jesus
with
which
the
pillar
and
the
adjacent
parts
were
saturated
they
left
the
forum
and
went
into
a
neighbouring
small
house
the
owner
of
which
i
do
not
know
john
was
not
i
think
present
at
the
scourging
of
jesus
a
gallery
encircled
the
inner
court
of
the
guardhouse
where
our
lord
was
crowned
with
thorns
and
the
doors
were
open
the
cowardly
ruffians
who
were
eagerly
waiting
to
gratify
their
cruelty
by
torturing
and
insulting
our
lord
were
about
fifty
in
number
and
the
greatest
part
slaves
or
servants
of
the
jailers
and
soldiers
the
mob
gathered
round
the
building
but
were
soon
displaced
by
a
thousand
roman
soldiers
who
were
drawn
up
in
good
order
and
stationed
there
although
forbidden
to
leave
their
ranks
these
soldiers
nevertheless
did
their
utmost
by
laughter
and
applause
to
incite
the
cruel
executioners
to
redouble
their
insults
and
as
public
applause
gives
fresh
energy
to
a
comedian
so
did
their
words
of
encouragement
increase
tenfold
the
cruelty
of
these
men
in
the
middle
of
the
court
there
stood
the
fragment
of
a
pillar
and
on
it
was
placed
a
very
low
stool
which
these
cruel
men
maliciously
covered
with
sharp
flints
and
bits
of
broken
potsherds
then
they
tore
off
the
garments
of
jesus
thereby
reopening
all
his
wounds
threw
over
his
shoulders
an
old
scarlet
mantle
which
barely
reached
his
knees
dragged
him
to
the
seat
prepared
and
pushed
him
roughly
down
upon
it
having
first
placed
the
crown
of
thorns
upon
his
head
the
crown
of
thorns
was
made
of
three
branches
plaited
together
the
greatest
part
of
the
thorns
being
purposely
turned
inwards
so
as
to
pierce
our
head
having
first
placed
these
twisted
branches
on
his
forehead
they
tied
them
tightly
together
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
no
sooner
was
this
accomplished
to
their
satisfaction
than
they
put
a
large
reed
into
his
hand
doing
all
with
derisive
gravity
as
if
they
were
really
crowning
him
king
they
then
seized
the
reed
and
struck
his
head
so
violently
that
his
eyes
were
filled
with
blood
they
knelt
before
him
derided
him
spat
in
his
face
and
buffeted
him
saying
at
the
same
time
king
of
the
jews
then
they
threw
down
his
stool
pulled
him
up
again
from
the
ground
on
which
he
had
fallen
and
reseated
him
with
the
greatest
possible
brutality
it
is
quite
impossible
to
describe
the
cruel
outrages
which
were
thought
of
and
perpetrated
by
these
monsters
under
human
form
the
sufferings
of
jesus
from
thirst
caused
by
the
fever
which
his
wounds
and
sufferings
had
brought
on
were
he
trembled
all
over
his
flesh
was
torn
piecemeal
his
tongue
contracted
and
the
only
refreshment
he
received
was
the
blood
which
trickled
from
his
head
on
to
his
parched
lips
this
shameful
scene
was
protracted
a
full
and
the
roman
soldiers
continued
during
the
whole
time
to
applaud
and
encourage
the
perpetration
of
still
greater
outrages
chapter
xxvii
ecce
homo
the
cruel
executioners
then
reconducted
our
lord
to
pilate
palace
with
the
scarlet
cloak
still
thrown
over
his
shoulders
the
crown
of
thorns
on
his
head
and
the
reed
in
his
fettered
hands
he
was
perfectly
unrecognisable
his
eyes
mouth
and
beard
being
covered
with
blood
his
body
but
one
wound
and
his
back
bowed
down
as
that
of
an
aged
man
while
every
limb
trembled
as
he
walked
when
pilate
saw
him
standing
at
the
entrance
of
his
tribunal
even
he
as
he
usually
was
started
and
shuddered
with
horror
and
compassion
whilst
the
barbarous
priests
and
the
populace
far
from
being
moved
to
pity
continued
their
insults
and
mockery
when
jesus
had
ascended
the
stairs
pilate
came
forward
the
trumpet
was
sounded
to
announce
that
the
governor
was
about
to
speak
and
he
addressed
the
chief
priests
and
the
bystanders
in
the
following
words
i
bring
him
forth
to
you
that
you
may
know
that
i
find
no
cause
in
him
the
archers
then
led
jesus
up
to
pilate
that
the
people
might
again
feast
their
cruel
eyes
on
him
in
the
state
of
degradation
to
which
he
was
reduced
terrible
and
heartrending
indeed
was
the
spectacle
he
presented
and
an
exclamation
of
horror
burst
from
the
multitude
followed
by
a
dead
silence
when
he
with
difficulty
raised
his
wounded
head
crowned
as
it
was
with
thorns
and
cast
his
exhausted
glance
on
the
excited
throng
pilate
exclaimed
as
he
pointed
him
out
to
the
people
homo
behold
the
man
the
hatred
of
the
high
priests
and
their
followers
was
if
possible
increased
at
the
sight
of
jesus
and
they
cried
out
him
to
death
crucify
him
you
not
content
said
pilate
punishment
he
has
received
is
beyond
question
sufficient
to
deprive
him
of
all
desire
of
making
himself
king
but
they
cried
out
the
more
and
the
multitude
joined
in
the
cry
him
crucify
him
pilate
then
sounded
the
trumpet
to
demand
silence
and
said
you
him
and
crucify
him
for
i
find
no
cause
in
him
have
a
law
and
according
to
that
law
he
ought
to
die
replied
the
priests
he
made
himself
the
son
of
god
these
words
made
himself
the
son
of
god
revived
the
fears
of
pilate
he
took
jesus
into
another
room
and
asked
him
art
thou
but
jesus
made
no
answer
thou
not
to
me
said
pilate
thou
not
that
i
have
power
to
crucify
thee
and
power
to
release
thee
shouldst
not
have
any
power
against
me
replied
jesus
it
were
given
thee
from
above
therefore
he
that
hath
delivered
me
to
thee
hath
the
greater
sin
the
undecided
weak
conduct
of
pilate
filled
claudia
procles
with
anxiety
she
again
sent
him
the
pledge
to
remind
him
of
his
promise
but
he
only
returned
a
vague
superstitious
answer
importing
that
he
should
leave
the
decision
of
the
case
to
the
gods
the
enemies
of
jesus
the
high
priests
and
the
pharisees
having
heard
of
the
efforts
which
were
being
made
by
claudia
to
save
him
caused
a
report
to
be
spread
among
the
people
that
the
partisans
of
our
lord
had
seduced
her
that
he
would
be
released
and
then
join
the
romans
and
bring
about
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
and
the
extermination
of
the
jews
pilate
was
in
such
a
state
of
indecision
and
uncertainty
as
to
be
perfectly
beside
himself
he
did
not
know
what
step
to
take
next
and
again
addressed
himself
to
the
enemies
of
jesus
declaring
that
found
no
crime
in
him
but
they
demanded
his
death
still
more
clamorously
he
then
remembered
the
contradictory
accusations
which
had
been
brought
against
jesus
the
mysterious
dreams
of
his
wife
and
the
unaccountable
impression
which
the
words
of
jesus
had
made
on
himself
and
therefore
determined
to
question
him
again
in
order
thus
to
obtain
some
information
which
might
enlighten
him
as
to
the
course
he
ought
to
pursue
he
therefore
returned
to
the
praetorium
went
alone
into
a
room
and
sent
for
our
saviour
he
glanced
at
the
mangled
and
bleeding
form
before
him
and
exclaimed
inwardly
it
possible
that
he
can
be
god
then
he
turned
to
jesus
and
adjured
him
to
tell
him
if
he
was
god
if
he
was
that
king
who
had
been
promised
to
the
jews
where
his
kingdom
was
and
to
what
class
of
gods
he
belonged
i
can
only
give
the
sense
of
the
words
of
jesus
but
they
were
solemn
and
severe
he
told
him
his
kingdom
was
not
of
this
world
and
likewise
spoke
strongly
of
the
many
hidden
crimes
with
which
the
conscience
of
pilate
was
defiled
warned
him
of
the
dreadful
fate
which
would
be
his
if
he
did
not
repent
and
finally
declared
that
he
himself
the
son
of
man
would
come
at
the
last
day
to
pronounce
a
just
judgment
upon
him
pilate
was
half
frightened
and
half
angry
at
the
words
of
jesus
he
returned
to
the
balcony
and
again
declared
that
he
would
release
jesus
but
they
cried
out
thou
release
this
man
thou
art
not
friend
for
whosoever
maketh
himself
a
king
speaketh
against
caesar
others
said
that
they
would
accuse
him
to
the
emperor
of
having
disturbed
their
festival
that
he
must
make
up
his
mind
at
once
because
they
were
obliged
to
be
in
the
temple
by
ten
at
night
the
cry
him
crucify
him
resounded
on
all
sides
it
even
from
the
flat
roofs
of
the
houses
near
the
forum
where
many
persons
were
assembled
pilate
saw
that
all
his
efforts
were
vain
that
he
could
make
no
impression
on
the
infuriated
mob
their
yells
and
imprecations
were
deafening
and
he
began
to
fear
an
insurrection
therefore
he
took
water
and
washed
his
hands
before
the
people
saying
am
innocent
of
the
blood
of
this
just
man
look
you
to
it
a
frightful
and
unanimous
cry
then
came
from
the
dense
multitude
who
were
assembled
from
all
parts
of
palestine
blood
be
upon
us
and
upon
our
children
chapter
xxviii
reflections
on
the
visions
whenever
during
my
meditations
on
the
passion
of
our
lord
i
imagine
i
hear
that
frightful
cry
of
the
jews
blood
be
upon
us
and
upon
our
children
visions
of
a
wonderful
and
terrible
description
display
before
my
eyes
at
the
same
moment
the
effect
of
that
solemn
curse
i
fancy
i
see
a
gloomy
sky
covered
with
clouds
of
the
colour
of
blood
from
which
issue
fiery
swords
and
darts
lowering
over
the
vociferating
multitude
and
this
curse
which
they
have
entailed
upon
themselves
appears
to
me
to
penetrate
even
to
the
very
marrow
of
their
bones
even
to
the
unborn
infants
they
appear
to
me
encompassed
on
all
sides
by
darkness
the
words
they
utter
take
in
my
eyes
the
form
of
black
flames
which
recoil
upon
them
penetrating
the
bodies
of
some
and
only
playing
around
others
the
were
those
who
were
converted
after
the
death
of
jesus
and
who
were
in
considerable
numbers
for
neither
jesus
nor
mary
ever
ceased
praying
in
the
midst
of
their
sufferings
for
the
salvation
of
these
miserable
beings
when
during
visions
of
this
kind
i
turn
my
thoughts
to
the
holy
souls
of
jesus
and
mary
and
to
those
of
the
enemies
of
christ
all
that
takes
place
within
them
is
shown
me
under
various
forms
i
see
numerous
devils
among
the
crowd
exciting
and
encouraging
the
jews
whispering
in
their
ears
entering
their
mouths
inciting
them
still
more
against
jesus
but
nevertheless
trembling
at
the
sight
of
his
ineffable
love
and
heavenly
patience
innumerable
angels
surrounded
jesus
mary
and
the
small
number
of
saints
who
were
there
the
exterior
of
these
angels
denotes
the
office
they
fill
some
represent
consolation
others
prayer
or
some
of
the
works
of
mercy
i
likewise
often
see
consolatory
and
at
other
times
menacing
voices
under
the
appearance
of
bright
or
coloured
gleams
of
light
issuing
from
the
mouths
of
these
different
apparitions
and
i
see
the
feelings
of
their
souls
their
interior
sufferings
and
in
a
word
their
every
thought
under
the
appearance
of
dark
or
bright
rays
i
then
understand
everything
perfectly
but
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
give
an
explanation
to
others
besides
which
i
am
so
ill
and
so
totally
overcome
by
the
grief
which
i
feel
for
my
own
sins
and
for
those
of
the
world
i
am
so
overpowered
by
the
sight
of
the
sufferings
of
our
lord
that
i
can
hardly
imagine
how
it
is
possible
for
me
to
relate
events
with
the
slightest
coherency
many
of
these
things
but
more
especially
the
apparitions
of
devils
and
of
angels
which
are
related
by
other
persons
who
have
had
visions
of
the
passion
of
jesus
christ
are
fragments
of
symbolical
interior
perceptions
of
this
species
which
vary
according
to
the
state
of
the
soul
of
the
spectator
hence
the
numerous
contradictions
because
many
things
are
naturally
forgotten
or
omitted
sister
emmerich
sometimes
spoke
on
these
subjects
either
during
the
time
of
her
visions
on
the
passion
or
before
they
commenced
but
she
more
often
refused
to
speak
at
all
concerning
them
for
fear
of
causing
confusion
in
the
visions
it
is
easy
to
see
how
difficult
it
must
have
been
for
her
in
the
midst
of
such
a
variety
of
apparitions
to
preserve
any
degree
of
connection
in
her
narrations
who
can
therefore
be
surprised
at
finding
some
omissions
and
confusion
in
her
descriptions
chapter
xxix
jesus
condemned
to
be
crucified
pilate
who
did
not
desire
to
know
the
truth
but
was
solely
anxious
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
without
harm
to
himself
became
more
undecided
than
ever
his
conscience
whispered
is
innocent
his
wife
said
is
holy
his
superstitious
feelings
made
him
fear
that
jesus
was
the
enemy
of
his
gods
and
his
cowardice
filled
him
with
dread
lest
jesus
if
he
was
a
god
should
wreak
his
vengeance
upon
his
judge
he
was
both
irritated
and
alarmed
at
the
last
words
of
jesus
and
he
made
another
attempt
for
his
release
but
the
jews
instantly
threatened
to
lay
an
accusation
against
him
before
the
emperor
this
menace
terrified
him
and
he
determined
to
accede
to
their
wishes
although
firmly
convinced
in
his
own
mind
of
the
innocence
of
jesus
and
perfectly
conscious
that
by
pronouncing
sentence
of
death
upon
him
he
should
violate
every
law
of
justice
besides
breaking
the
promise
he
had
made
to
his
wife
in
the
morning
thus
did
he
sacrifice
jesus
to
the
enmity
of
the
jews
and
endeavour
to
stifle
remorse
by
washing
his
hands
before
the
people
saying
am
innocent
of
the
blood
of
this
just
man
look
you
to
it
vainly
dost
thou
pronounce
these
words
o
pilate
for
his
blood
is
on
thy
head
likewise
thou
canst
not
wash
his
blood
from
thy
soul
as
thou
dost
from
thy
hands
those
fearful
words
blood
be
upon
us
and
upon
our
children
had
scarcely
ceased
to
resound
when
pilate
commenced
his
preparations
for
passing
sentence
he
called
for
the
dress
which
he
wore
on
state
occasions
put
a
species
of
diadem
set
in
precious
stones
on
his
head
changed
his
mantle
and
caused
a
staff
to
be
carried
before
him
he
was
surrounded
with
soldiers
preceded
by
officers
belonging
to
the
tribunal
and
followed
by
scribes
who
carried
rolls
of
parchments
and
books
used
for
inscribing
names
and
dates
one
man
walked
in
front
who
carried
the
trumpet
the
procession
marched
in
this
order
from
palace
to
the
forum
where
an
elevated
seat
used
on
these
particular
occasions
was
placed
opposite
to
the
pillar
where
jesus
was
scourged
this
tribunal
was
called
gabbatha
it
was
a
kind
of
round
terrace
ascended
by
means
of
staircases
on
the
top
was
a
seat
for
pilate
and
behind
this
seat
a
bench
for
those
in
minor
offices
while
a
number
of
soldiers
were
stationed
round
the
terrace
and
upon
the
staircases
many
of
the
pharisees
had
left
the
palace
and
were
gone
to
the
temple
so
that
annas
caiphas
and
priests
alone
followed
the
roman
governor
on
to
the
forum
and
the
two
thieves
were
taken
there
at
the
time
that
pilate
presented
our
saviour
to
the
people
saying
homo
our
lord
was
still
clothed
in
his
purple
garment
his
crown
of
thorns
upon
his
head
and
his
hands
manacled
when
the
archers
brought
him
up
to
the
tribunal
and
placed
him
between
the
two
malefactors
as
soon
as
pilate
was
seated
he
again
addressed
the
enemies
of
jesus
in
these
words
your
king
but
the
cries
of
him
crucify
him
resounded
on
all
sides
i
crucify
your
king
said
pilate
have
no
king
but
caesar
responded
the
high
priests
pilate
found
it
was
utterly
hopeless
to
say
anything
more
and
therefore
commenced
his
preparations
for
passing
sentence
the
two
thieves
had
received
their
sentence
of
crucifixion
some
time
before
but
the
high
priests
had
obtained
a
respite
for
them
in
order
that
our
lord
might
suffer
the
additional
ignominy
of
being
executed
with
two
criminals
of
the
most
infamous
description
the
crosses
of
the
two
thieves
were
by
their
sides
that
intended
fro
our
lord
was
not
brought
because
he
was
not
as
yet
sentenced
to
death
the
blessed
virgin
who
had
retired
to
some
distance
after
the
scourging
of
jesus
again
approached
to
hear
the
sentence
of
death
pronounced
upon
her
son
and
her
god
jesus
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
archers
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
leading
up
to
the
tribunal
the
trumpet
was
sounded
to
demand
silence
and
then
the
cowardly
the
base
judge
in
a
tremulous
undecided
voice
pronounced
the
sentence
of
death
on
the
just
man
the
sight
of
the
cowardice
and
duplicity
of
this
despicable
being
who
was
nevertheless
puffed
up
with
pride
at
his
important
position
almost
overcame
me
and
the
ferocious
joy
of
the
executioners
the
triumphant
countenances
of
the
high
priests
added
to
the
deplorable
condition
to
which
our
loving
saviour
was
reduced
and
the
agonising
grief
of
his
beloved
mother
still
further
increased
my
pain
i
looked
up
again
and
saw
the
cruel
jews
almost
devouring
their
victim
with
their
eyes
the
soldiers
standing
coldly
by
and
multitudes
of
horrible
demons
passing
to
and
fro
and
mixing
in
the
crowd
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
have
been
in
the
place
of
jesus
my
beloved
spouse
for
the
sentence
would
not
then
have
been
unjust
but
i
was
so
overcome
with
anguish
and
my
sufferings
were
so
intense
that
i
can
not
exactly
remember
all
that
i
did
see
however
i
will
relate
all
as
nearly
as
i
can
after
a
long
preamble
which
was
composed
principally
of
the
most
pompous
and
exaggerated
eulogy
of
the
emperor
tiberias
pilate
spoke
of
the
accusations
which
had
been
brought
against
jesus
by
the
high
priests
he
said
that
they
had
condemned
him
to
death
for
having
disturbed
the
public
peace
and
broken
their
laws
by
calling
himself
the
son
of
god
and
king
of
the
jews
and
that
the
people
had
unanimously
demanded
that
their
decree
should
be
carried
out
notwithstanding
his
oft
repeated
conviction
of
the
innocence
of
jesus
this
mean
and
worthless
judge
was
not
ashamed
of
saying
that
he
likewise
considered
their
decision
a
just
one
and
that
he
should
therefore
pronounce
sentence
which
he
did
in
these
words
condemn
jesus
of
nazareth
the
king
of
the
jews
to
be
crucified
and
he
ordered
the
executioners
to
bring
the
cross
i
think
i
remember
likewise
that
he
took
a
long
stick
in
his
hands
broke
it
and
threw
the
fragments
at
the
feet
of
jesus
on
hearing
these
words
of
pilate
the
mother
of
jesus
became
for
a
few
moments
totally
unconscious
for
she
was
now
certain
that
her
beloved
son
must
die
the
most
ignominious
and
the
most
painful
of
all
deaths
john
and
the
holy
women
carried
her
away
to
prevent
the
heartless
beings
who
surrounded
them
from
adding
crime
to
crime
by
jeering
at
her
grief
but
no
sooner
did
she
revive
a
little
than
she
begged
to
be
taken
again
to
each
spot
which
had
been
sanctified
by
the
sufferings
of
her
son
in
order
to
bedew
them
with
her
tears
and
thus
did
the
mother
of
our
lord
in
the
name
of
the
church
take
possession
of
those
holy
places
pilate
then
wrote
down
the
sentence
and
those
who
stood
behind
him
copied
it
out
three
times
the
words
which
he
wrote
were
quite
different
from
those
he
had
pronounced
i
could
see
plainly
that
his
mind
was
dreadfully
agitated
an
angel
of
wrath
appeared
to
guide
his
hand
the
substance
of
the
written
sentence
was
this
have
been
compelled
for
fear
of
an
insurrection
to
yield
to
the
wishes
of
the
high
priests
the
sanhedrin
and
the
people
who
tumultuously
demanded
the
death
of
jesus
of
nazareth
whom
they
accused
of
having
disturbed
the
public
peace
and
also
of
having
blasphemed
and
broken
their
laws
i
have
given
him
up
to
them
to
be
crucified
although
their
accusations
appeared
to
be
groundless
i
have
done
so
for
fear
of
their
alleging
to
the
emperor
that
i
encourage
insurrections
and
cause
dissatisfaction
among
the
jews
by
denying
them
the
rights
of
justice
he
then
wrote
the
inscription
for
the
cross
while
his
clerks
copied
out
the
sentence
several
times
that
these
copies
might
be
sent
to
distant
parts
of
the
country
the
high
priests
were
extremely
dissatisfied
at
the
words
of
the
sentence
which
they
said
were
not
true
and
they
clamorously
surrounded
the
tribunal
to
endeavour
to
persuade
him
to
alter
the
inscription
and
not
to
put
king
of
the
jews
but
that
he
said
i
am
the
king
of
the
jews
pilate
was
vexed
and
answered
impatiently
i
have
written
i
have
written
they
were
likewise
anxious
that
the
cross
of
our
lord
should
not
be
higher
than
those
of
the
two
thieves
but
it
was
necessary
for
it
to
be
so
because
there
would
otherwise
not
have
been
sufficient
place
for
pilate
inscription
they
therefore
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
not
to
have
this
obnoxious
inscription
put
up
at
all
but
pilate
was
determined
and
their
words
made
no
impression
upon
him
the
cross
was
therefore
obliged
to
be
lengthened
by
a
fresh
bit
of
wood
consequently
the
form
of
the
cross
was
peculiar
the
two
arms
stood
out
like
the
branches
of
a
tree
growing
from
the
stem
and
the
shape
was
very
like
that
of
the
letter
y
with
the
lower
part
lengthened
so
as
to
rise
between
the
arms
which
had
been
put
on
separately
and
were
thinner
than
the
body
of
the
cross
a
piece
of
wood
was
likewise
nailed
at
the
bottom
of
the
cross
for
the
feet
to
rest
upon
during
the
time
that
pilate
was
pronouncing
the
iniquitous
sentence
i
saw
his
wife
claudia
procles
send
him
back
the
pledge
which
he
had
given
her
and
in
the
evening
she
left
his
palace
and
joined
the
friends
of
our
lord
who
concealed
her
in
a
subterraneous
vault
in
the
house
of
lazarus
at
jerusalem
later
in
the
same
day
i
likewise
saw
a
friend
of
our
lord
engrave
the
words
judex
injustus
and
the
name
of
claudia
procles
on
a
greenlooking
stone
which
was
behind
the
terrace
called
gabbatha
this
stone
is
still
to
be
found
in
the
foundations
of
a
church
or
house
at
jerusalem
which
stands
on
the
spot
formerly
called
gabbatha
claudia
procles
became
a
christian
followed
paul
and
became
his
particular
friend
no
sooner
had
pilate
pronounced
sentence
than
jesus
was
given
up
into
the
hands
of
the
archers
and
the
clothes
which
he
had
taken
off
in
the
court
of
caiphas
were
brought
for
him
to
put
on
again
i
think
some
charitable
persons
had
washed
them
for
they
looked
clean
the
ruffians
who
surrounded
jesus
untied
his
hands
for
his
dress
to
be
changed
and
roughly
dragged
off
the
scarlet
mantle
with
which
they
had
clothed
him
in
mockery
thereby
reopening
all
his
wounds
he
put
on
his
own
linen
with
trembling
hands
and
they
threw
his
scapular
over
his
shoulders
as
the
crown
of
thorns
was
too
large
and
prevented
the
seamless
robe
which
his
mother
had
made
for
him
from
going
over
his
head
they
pulled
it
off
violently
heedless
of
the
pain
thus
inflicted
upon
him
his
white
woollen
dress
was
next
thrown
over
his
shoulders
and
then
his
wide
belt
and
cloak
after
this
they
again
tied
round
his
waist
a
ring
covered
with
sharp
iron
points
and
to
it
they
fastened
the
cords
by
which
he
was
led
doing
all
with
their
usual
brutal
cruelty
the
two
thieves
were
standing
one
on
the
right
and
the
other
on
the
left
of
jesus
with
their
hands
tied
and
a
chain
round
their
necks
they
were
covered
with
black
and
lived
marks
the
effects
of
the
scourging
of
the
previous
day
the
demeanour
of
the
one
who
was
afterwards
converted
was
quiet
and
peaceable
while
that
of
the
other
on
the
contrary
was
rough
and
insolent
and
he
joined
the
archers
in
abusing
and
insulting
jesus
who
looked
upon
his
two
companions
with
love
and
compassion
and
offered
up
his
sufferings
for
their
salvation
the
archers
gathered
together
all
the
implements
necessary
for
the
crucifixions
and
prepared
everything
for
the
terrible
and
painful
journey
to
calvary
annas
and
caiphas
at
last
left
off
disputing
with
pilate
and
angrily
retired
taking
with
them
the
sheets
of
parchment
on
which
the
sentence
was
written
they
went
away
in
haste
fearing
that
they
should
get
to
the
temple
too
late
for
the
paschal
sacrifice
thus
did
the
high
priests
unknowingly
to
themselves
leave
the
true
paschal
lamb
they
went
to
a
temple
made
of
stone
to
immolate
and
to
sacrifice
that
lamb
which
was
but
a
symbol
and
they
left
the
true
paschal
lamb
who
was
being
led
to
the
altar
of
the
cross
by
the
cruel
executioners
they
were
most
careful
not
to
contract
exterior
defilement
while
their
souls
were
completely
defiled
by
anger
hatred
and
envy
they
had
said
blood
be
upon
us
and
upon
our
children
and
by
these
words
they
had
performed
the
ceremony
and
had
placed
the
hand
of
the
sacrificer
upon
the
head
of
the
victim
thus
were
the
two
paths
formed
the
one
leading
to
the
altar
belonging
to
the
jewish
law
the
other
leading
to
the
altar
of
grace
pilate
that
proud
and
irresolute
pagan
that
slave
of
the
world
who
trembled
in
the
presence
of
the
true
god
and
yet
adored
his
false
gods
took
a
middle
path
and
returned
to
his
palace
the
iniquitous
sentence
was
given
at
about
ten
in
the
morning
chapter
xxx
the
carrying
of
the
cross
when
pilate
left
the
tribunal
a
portion
of
the
soldiers
followed
him
and
were
drawn
up
in
files
before
the
palace
a
few
accompanying
the
criminals
armed
pharisees
came
to
the
forum
on
horseback
in
order
to
accompany
jesus
to
the
place
of
execution
and
among
these
were
the
six
enemies
of
jesus
who
had
assisted
in
arresting
him
in
the
garden
of
olives
the
archers
led
jesus
into
the
middle
of
the
court
the
slaves
threw
down
the
cross
at
his
feet
and
the
two
arms
were
forthwith
tied
on
to
the
centre
piece
jesus
knelt
down
by
its
side
encircled
it
with
his
sacred
arms
and
kissed
it
three
times
addressing
at
the
same
time
a
most
touching
prayer
of
thanksgiving
to
his
heavenly
father
for
that
work
of
redemption
which
he
had
begun
it
was
the
custom
among
pagans
for
the
priest
to
embrace
a
new
altar
and
jesus
in
like
manner
embraced
his
cross
that
august
altar
on
which
the
bloody
and
expiatory
sacrifice
was
about
to
be
offered
the
archers
soon
made
him
rise
and
then
kneel
down
again
and
almost
without
any
assistance
place
the
heavy
cross
on
his
right
shoulder
supporting
its
great
weight
with
his
right
hand
i
saw
angels
come
to
his
assistance
otherwise
he
would
have
been
unable
even
to
raise
it
from
the
ground
whilst
he
was
on
his
knees
and
still
praying
the
executioners
put
the
arms
of
the
crosses
which
were
a
little
curbed
and
not
as
yet
fastened
to
the
centre
pieces
on
the
backs
of
the
two
thieves
and
tied
their
hands
tightly
to
them
the
middle
parts
of
the
crosses
were
carried
by
slaves
as
the
transverse
pieces
were
not
to
be
fastened
to
them
until
just
before
the
time
of
execution
the
trumpet
sounded
to
announce
the
departure
of
horsemen
and
one
of
the
pharisees
belonging
to
the
escort
came
up
to
jesus
who
was
still
kneeling
and
said
we
have
had
a
sufficiency
of
thy
fine
speeches
rise
and
set
off
they
pulled
him
roughly
up
for
he
was
totally
unable
to
rise
without
assistance
and
he
then
felt
upon
his
shoulders
the
weight
of
that
cross
which
we
must
carry
after
him
according
to
his
true
and
holy
command
to
follow
him
thus
began
that
triumphant
march
of
the
king
of
kings
a
march
so
ignominious
on
earth
and
so
glorious
in
heaven
by
means
of
ropes
which
the
executioners
had
fastened
to
the
foot
of
the
cross
two
archers
supported
it
to
prevent
its
getting
entangled
in
anything
and
four
other
soldiers
took
hold
of
the
ropes
which
they
had
fastened
to
jesus
underneath
his
clothes
the
sight
of
our
dear
lord
trembling
beneath
his
burden
reminded
me
forcibly
of
isaac
when
he
carried
the
wood
destined
for
his
own
sacrifice
up
the
mountains
the
trumpet
of
pilate
was
sounded
as
the
signal
for
departure
for
he
himself
intended
to
go
to
calvary
at
the
head
of
a
detachment
of
soldiers
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
an
insurrection
he
was
on
horseback
in
armour
surrounded
by
officers
and
a
body
of
cavalry
and
followed
by
about
three
hundred
of
the
infantry
who
came
from
the
frontiers
of
italy
and
switzerland
the
procession
was
headed
by
a
trumpeter
who
sounded
his
trumpet
at
every
corner
and
proclaimed
the
sentence
a
number
of
women
and
children
walked
behind
the
procession
with
ropes
nails
wedges
and
baskets
filled
with
different
articles
in
their
hands
others
who
were
stronger
carried
poles
ladders
and
the
centre
pieces
of
the
crosses
of
the
two
thieves
and
some
of
the
pharisees
followed
on
horseback
a
boy
who
had
charge
of
the
inscription
which
pilate
had
written
for
the
cross
likewise
carried
the
crown
of
thorns
which
had
been
taken
off
the
head
of
jesus
at
the
end
of
a
long
stick
but
he
did
not
appear
to
be
wicked
and
like
the
rest
next
i
beheld
our
blessed
saviour
and
redeemer
his
bare
feet
swollen
and
bleeding
his
back
bent
as
though
he
were
about
to
sink
under
the
heavy
weight
of
the
cross
and
his
whole
body
covered
with
wounds
and
blood
he
appeared
to
be
half
fainting
from
exhaustion
having
had
neither
refreshment
or
sleep
since
the
supper
of
the
previous
night
weak
from
loss
of
blood
and
parched
with
thirst
produced
by
fever
and
pain
he
supported
the
cross
on
his
right
shoulder
with
his
right
hand
the
left
hung
almost
powerless
at
his
side
but
he
endeavoured
now
and
then
to
hold
up
his
long
garment
to
prevent
his
bleeding
feet
from
getting
entangled
in
it
the
four
archers
who
held
the
cords
which
were
fastened
round
his
waist
walked
at
some
distance
from
him
the
two
in
front
pulled
him
on
and
the
two
behind
dragged
him
back
so
that
he
could
not
get
on
at
all
without
the
greatest
difficulty
his
hands
were
cut
by
the
cords
with
which
they
had
been
bound
his
face
bloody
and
disfigured
his
hair
and
beard
saturated
with
blood
the
weight
of
the
cross
and
of
his
chains
combined
to
press
and
make
the
woollen
dress
cleave
to
his
wounds
and
reopen
them
derisive
and
heartless
words
alone
were
addressed
to
him
but
he
continued
to
pray
for
his
persecutors
and
his
countenance
bore
an
expression
of
combined
love
and
resignation
many
soldiers
under
arms
walked
by
the
side
of
the
procession
and
after
jesus
came
the
two
thieves
who
were
likewise
led
the
arms
of
their
crosses
separate
from
the
middle
being
placed
upon
their
backs
and
their
hands
tied
tightly
to
the
two
ends
they
were
clothed
in
large
aprons
with
a
sort
of
sleeveless
scapular
which
covered
the
upper
part
of
their
bodies
and
they
had
straw
caps
upon
their
heads
the
good
thief
was
calm
but
the
other
was
on
the
contrary
furious
and
never
ceased
cursing
and
swearing
the
rear
of
the
procession
was
brought
up
by
the
remainder
of
the
pharisees
on
horseback
who
rode
to
and
fro
to
keep
order
pilate
and
his
courtiers
were
at
a
certain
distance
behind
he
was
in
the
midst
of
his
officers
clad
in
armour
preceded
by
a
squadron
of
cavalry
and
followed
by
three
hundred
foot
soldiers
he
crossed
the
forum
and
then
entered
one
of
the
principal
streets
for
he
was
marching
through
the
town
in
order
to
prevent
any
insurrection
among
the
people
jesus
was
conducted
by
a
narrow
back
street
that
the
procession
might
not
inconvenience
the
persons
who
were
going
to
the
temple
and
likewise
in
order
that
pilate
and
his
band
might
have
the
whole
principal
street
entirely
to
themselves
the
crowd
had
dispersed
and
started
in
different
directions
almost
immediately
after
the
reading
of
the
sentence
and
the
greatest
part
of
the
jews
either
returned
to
their
own
houses
or
to
the
temple
to
hasten
their
preparations
for
sacrificing
the
paschal
lamb
but
a
certain
number
were
still
hurrying
on
in
disorder
to
see
the
melancholy
procession
pass
the
roman
soldiers
prevented
all
persons
from
joining
the
procession
therefore
the
most
curious
were
obliged
to
go
round
by
back
streets
or
to
quicken
their
steps
so
as
to
reach
calvary
before
jesus
the
street
through
which
they
led
jesus
was
both
narrow
and
dirty
he
suffered
much
in
passing
through
it
because
the
archers
were
close
and
harassed
him
persons
stood
on
the
roofs
of
the
houses
and
at
the
windows
and
insulted
him
with
opprobrious
language
the
slaves
who
were
working
in
the
streets
threw
filth
and
mud
at
him
even
the
children
incited
by
his
enemies
had
filled
their
pinafores
with
sharp
stones
which
they
throw
down
before
their
doors
as
he
passed
that
he
might
be
obliged
to
walk
over
them
chapter
xxxi
the
first
fall
of
jesus
the
street
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
after
turning
a
little
to
the
left
became
rather
steep
as
also
wider
a
subterranean
aqueduct
proceeding
from
mount
sion
passed
under
it
and
in
its
vicinity
was
a
hollow
which
was
often
filled
with
water
and
mud
after
rain
and
a
large
stone
was
placed
in
its
centre
to
enable
persons
to
pass
over
more
easily
when
jesus
reached
this
spot
his
strength
was
perfectly
exhausted
he
was
quite
unable
to
move
and
as
the
archers
dragged
and
pushed
him
without
showing
the
slightest
compassion
he
fell
quite
down
against
this
stone
and
the
cross
fell
by
his
side
the
cruel
executioners
were
obliged
to
stop
they
abused
and
struck
him
unmercifully
but
the
whole
procession
came
to
a
standstill
which
caused
a
degree
of
confusion
vainly
did
he
hold
out
his
hand
for
someone
to
assist
him
to
rise
he
exclaimed
will
soon
be
over
and
he
prayed
for
his
enemies
lift
him
up
said
the
pharisees
he
will
die
in
our
hands
there
were
many
women
and
children
following
the
procession
the
former
wept
and
the
latter
were
frightened
jesus
however
received
support
from
above
and
raised
his
head
but
these
cruel
men
far
from
endeavouring
to
alleviate
his
sufferings
put
the
crown
of
thorns
again
on
his
head
before
they
pulled
him
out
of
the
mud
and
no
sooner
was
he
once
more
on
his
feet
than
they
replaced
the
cross
on
his
back
the
crown
of
thorns
which
encircled
his
head
increased
his
pain
inexpressibly
and
obliged
him
to
bend
on
one
side
to
give
room
for
the
cross
which
lay
heavily
on
his
shoulders
chapter
xxxii
the
second
fall
of
jesus
the
afflicted
mother
of
jesus
had
left
the
forum
accompanied
by
john
and
some
other
women
immediately
after
the
unjust
sentence
was
pronounced
she
had
employed
herself
in
walking
to
many
of
the
spots
sanctified
by
our
lord
and
watering
them
with
her
tears
but
when
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
the
rush
of
people
and
the
clang
of
the
horsemen
announced
that
the
procession
was
about
to
start
for
calvary
she
could
not
resist
her
longing
desire
to
behold
her
beloved
son
once
more
and
she
begged
john
to
take
her
to
some
place
through
which
he
must
pass
john
conducted
her
to
a
palace
which
had
an
entrance
in
that
street
which
jesus
traversed
after
his
first
fall
it
was
i
believe
the
residence
of
the
high
priest
caiphas
whose
tribunal
was
in
the
division
called
sion
john
asked
and
obtained
leave
from
a
servant
to
stand
at
the
entrance
mentioned
above
with
mary
and
her
companions
the
mother
of
god
was
pale
her
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
and
she
was
closely
wrapped
in
a
cloak
of
a
colour
the
clamour
and
insulting
speeches
of
the
enraged
multitude
might
be
plainly
heard
and
a
herald
at
that
moment
proclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
that
three
criminals
were
about
to
be
crucified
the
servant
opened
the
door
the
dreadful
sounds
became
more
distinct
every
moment
and
mary
threw
herself
on
her
knees
after
praying
fervently
she
turned
to
john
and
said
i
remain
ought
i
to
go
away
shall
i
have
strength
to
support
such
a
sight
john
made
answer
you
do
not
remain
to
see
him
pass
you
will
grieve
afterwards
they
remained
therefore
near
the
door
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
procession
which
was
still
distant
but
advancing
by
slow
degrees
when
those
who
were
carrying
the
instruments
for
the
execution
approached
and
the
mother
of
jesus
saw
their
insolent
and
triumphant
looks
she
could
not
control
her
feelings
but
joined
her
hands
as
if
to
implore
the
help
of
heaven
upon
which
one
among
them
said
to
his
companions
woman
is
that
who
is
uttering
such
lamentations
another
answered
is
the
mother
of
the
galilean
when
the
cruel
men
heard
this
far
from
being
moved
to
compassion
they
began
to
make
game
of
the
grief
of
this
most
afflicted
mother
they
pointed
at
her
and
one
of
them
took
the
nails
which
were
to
be
used
for
fastening
jesus
to
the
cross
and
presented
them
to
her
in
an
insulting
manner
but
she
turned
away
fixed
her
eyes
upon
jesus
who
was
drawing
near
and
leant
against
the
pillar
for
support
lest
she
should
again
faint
from
grief
for
her
cheeks
were
as
pale
as
death
and
her
lips
almost
blue
the
pharisees
on
horseback
passed
by
first
followed
by
the
boy
who
carried
the
inscription
then
came
her
beloved
son
he
was
almost
sinking
under
the
heavy
weight
of
his
cross
and
his
head
still
crowned
with
thorns
was
drooping
in
agony
on
his
shoulder
he
cast
a
look
of
compassion
and
sorrow
upon
his
mother
staggered
and
fell
for
the
second
time
upon
his
hands
and
knees
mary
was
perfectly
agonised
at
this
sight
she
forgot
all
else
she
saw
neither
soldiers
nor
executioners
she
saw
nothing
but
her
son
and
springing
from
the
doorway
into
the
midst
of
the
group
who
were
insulting
and
abusing
him
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
by
his
side
and
embraced
him
the
only
words
i
heard
were
son
and
but
i
do
not
know
whether
these
words
were
really
uttered
or
whether
they
were
only
in
my
own
mind
a
momentary
confusion
ensued
john
and
the
holy
women
endeavoured
to
raise
mary
from
the
ground
and
the
archers
reproached
her
one
of
them
saying
hast
thou
to
do
her
woman
he
would
not
have
been
in
our
hands
if
he
had
been
better
brought
up
a
few
of
the
soldiers
looked
touched
and
although
they
obliged
the
blessed
virgin
to
retire
to
the
doorway
not
one
laid
hands
upon
her
john
and
the
women
surrounded
her
as
she
fell
half
fainting
against
a
stone
which
was
near
the
doorway
and
upon
which
the
impression
of
her
hands
remained
this
stone
was
very
hard
and
was
afterwards
removed
to
the
first
catholic
church
built
in
jerusalem
near
the
pool
of
bethsaida
during
the
time
that
james
the
less
was
bishop
of
that
city
the
two
disciples
who
were
with
the
mother
of
jesus
carried
her
into
the
house
and
the
door
was
shut
in
the
mean
time
the
archers
had
raised
jesus
and
obliged
him
to
carry
the
cross
in
a
different
manner
its
arm
being
unfastened
from
the
centre
and
entangled
in
the
ropes
with
which
he
was
bound
he
supported
them
on
his
arm
and
by
this
means
the
weight
of
the
body
of
the
cross
was
a
little
taken
off
as
it
dragged
more
on
the
ground
i
saw
numbers
of
persons
standing
about
in
groups
the
greatest
part
amusing
themselves
by
insulting
our
lord
in
different
ways
but
a
few
veiled
females
were
weeping
chapter
xxxiii
simon
of
cyrene
third
fall
of
jesus
the
procession
had
reached
an
arch
formed
in
an
old
wall
belonging
to
the
town
opposite
to
a
square
in
which
three
streets
terminated
when
jesus
stumbled
against
a
large
stone
which
was
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
archway
the
cross
slipped
from
his
shoulder
he
fell
upon
the
stone
and
was
totally
unable
to
rise
many
persons
who
were
on
their
way
to
the
temple
stopped
and
exclaimed
compassionately
at
that
poor
man
he
is
certainly
dying
but
his
enemies
showed
no
compassion
this
fall
caused
a
fresh
delay
as
our
lord
could
not
stand
up
again
and
the
pharisees
said
to
the
soldiers
shall
never
get
him
to
the
place
of
execution
alive
if
you
do
not
find
someone
to
carry
his
cross
at
this
moment
simon
of
cyrene
a
pagan
happened
to
pass
by
accompanied
by
his
three
children
he
was
a
gardener
just
returning
home
after
working
in
a
garden
near
the
eastern
wall
of
the
city
and
carrying
a
bundle
of
lopped
branches
the
soldiers
perceiving
by
his
dress
that
he
was
a
pagan
seized
him
and
ordered
him
to
assist
jesus
in
carrying
his
cross
he
refused
at
first
but
was
soon
compelled
to
obey
although
his
children
being
frightened
cried
and
made
a
great
noise
upon
which
some
women
quieted
and
took
charge
of
them
simon
was
much
annoyed
and
expressed
the
greatest
vexation
at
being
obliged
to
walk
with
a
man
in
so
deplorable
a
condition
of
dirt
and
misery
but
jesus
wept
and
cast
such
a
mild
and
heavenly
look
upon
him
that
he
was
touched
and
instead
of
continuing
to
show
reluctance
helped
him
to
rise
while
the
executioners
fastened
one
arm
of
the
cross
on
his
shoulders
and
he
walked
behind
our
lord
thus
relieving
him
in
a
great
measure
from
its
weight
and
when
all
was
arranged
the
procession
moved
forward
simon
was
a
man
apparently
about
forty
years
of
age
his
children
were
dressed
in
tunics
made
of
a
variegated
material
the
two
eldest
named
rufus
and
alexander
afterwards
joined
the
disciples
the
third
was
much
younger
but
a
few
years
later
went
to
live
with
stephen
simon
had
not
carried
the
cross
after
jesus
any
length
of
time
before
he
felt
his
heart
deeply
touched

grace

while
the
procession
was
passing
through
a
long
street
an
incident
took
place
which
made
a
strong
impression
upon
simon
numbers
of
respectable
persons
were
hurrying
towards
the
temple
of
whom
many
got
out
of
the
way
when
they
saw
jesus
from
a
pharisaical
fear
of
defilement
while
others
on
the
contrary
stopped
and
expressed
pity
for
his
sufferings
but
when
the
procession
had
advanced
about
two
hundred
steps
from
the
spot
where
simon
began
to
assist
our
lord
in
carrying
his
cross
the
door
of
a
beautiful
house
on
the
left
opened
and
a
woman
of
majestic
appearance
holding
a
young
girl
by
the
hand
came
out
and
walked
up
to
the
very
head
of
the
procession
seraphia
was
the
name
of
the
brave
woman
who
thus
dared
to
confront
the
enraged
multitude
she
was
the
wife
of
sirach
one
of
the
councillors
belonging
to
the
temple
and
was
afterwards
known
by
the
name
of
veronica
which
name
was
given
from
the
words
vera
icon
true
portrait
to
commemorate
her
brave
conduct
on
this
day
seraphia
had
prepared
some
excellent
aromatic
wine
which
she
piously
intended
to
present
to
our
lord
to
refresh
him
on
his
dolorous
way
to
calvary
she
had
been
standing
in
the
street
for
some
time
and
at
last
went
back
into
the
house
to
wait
she
was
when
i
first
saw
her
enveloped
in
a
long
veil
and
holding
a
little
girl
of
nine
years
of
age
whom
she
had
adopted
by
the
hand
a
large
veil
was
likewise
hanging
on
her
arm
and
the
little
girl
endeavoured
to
hide
the
jar
of
wine
when
the
procession
approached
those
who
were
marching
at
the
head
of
the
procession
tried
to
push
her
back
but
she
made
her
way
through
the
mob
the
soldiers
and
the
archers
reached
jesus
fell
on
her
knees
before
him
and
presented
the
veil
saying
at
the
same
time
me
to
wipe
the
face
of
my
lord
jesus
took
the
veil
in
his
left
hand
wiped
his
bleeding
face
and
returned
it
with
thanks
seraphia
kissed
it
and
put
it
under
her
cloak
the
girl
then
timidly
offered
the
wine
but
the
brutal
soldiers
would
not
allow
jesus
to
drink
it
the
suddenness
of
this
courageous
act
of
seraphia
had
surprised
the
guards
and
caused
a
momentary
although
unintentional
halt
of
which
she
had
taken
advantage
to
present
the
veil
to
her
divine
master
both
the
pharisees
and
the
guards
were
greatly
exasperated
not
only
by
the
sudden
halt
but
much
more
by
the
public
testimony
of
veneration
which
was
thus
paid
to
jesus
and
they
revenged
themselves
by
striking
and
abusing
him
while
seraphia
returned
in
haste
to
her
house
no
sooner
did
she
reach
her
room
than
she
placed
the
woollen
veil
on
a
table
and
fell
almost
senseless
on
her
knees
a
friend
who
entered
the
room
a
short
time
after
found
her
thus
kneeling
with
the
child
weeping
by
her
side
and
saw
to
his
astonishment
the
bloody
countenance
of
our
lord
imprinted
upon
the
veil
a
perfect
likeness
although
heartrending
and
painful
to
look
upon
he
roused
seraphia
and
pointed
to
the
veil
she
again
knelt
down
before
it
and
exclaimed
through
her
tears
i
shall
indeed
leave
all
with
a
happy
heart
for
my
lord
has
given
me
a
remembrance
of
himself
the
texture
of
this
veil
was
a
species
of
very
fine
wool
it
was
three
times
the
length
of
its
width
and
was
generally
worn
on
the
shoulders
it
was
customary
to
present
these
veil
to
persons
who
were
in
affliction
or
overfatigued
or
ill
that
they
might
wipe
their
faces
with
them
and
it
was
done
in
order
to
express
sympathy
or
compassion
veronica
kept
this
veil
until
her
death
and
hung
it
at
the
head
of
her
bed
it
was
then
given
to
the
blessed
virgin
who
left
it
to
the
apostles
and
they
afterwards
passed
it
on
to
the
church
seraphis
and
john
the
baptist
were
cousins
her
father
and
zacharias
being
brothers
when
joachim
and
anna
brought
the
blessed
virgin
who
was
then
only
four
years
old
up
to
jerusalem
to
place
her
among
the
virgins
in
the
temple
they
lodged
in
the
house
of
zacharias
which
was
situated
near
the
seraphia
was
at
least
five
years
older
than
the
blessed
virgin
was
present
at
her
marriage
with
joseph
and
was
likewise
related
to
the
aged
simeon
who
prophesied
when
the
child
jesus
was
put
into
his
arms
she
was
brought
up
with
his
sons
both
of
whom
as
well
as
seraphia
he
imbued
with
his
ardent
desire
of
seeing
our
lord
when
jesus
was
twelve
years
old
and
remained
teaching
in
the
temple
seraphia
who
was
not
then
married
sent
food
for
him
every
day
to
a
little
inn
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
jerusalem
where
he
dwelt
when
he
was
not
in
the
temple
mary
wet
there
for
two
days
when
on
her
way
from
bethlehem
to
jerusalem
to
offer
her
child
in
the
temple
the
two
old
men
who
kept
this
inn
were
essenians
and
well
acquainted
with
the
holy
family
it
contained
a
kind
of
foundation
for
the
poor
and
jesus
and
his
disciples
often
went
there
for
a
lodging
seraphia
married
rather
late
in
life
her
husband
sirach
was
descended
from
the
chaste
susannah
and
was
a
member
of
the
sanhedrin
he
was
at
first
greatly
opposed
to
our
lord
and
his
wife
suffered
much
on
account
of
her
attachment
to
jesus
and
to
the
holy
women
but
joseph
of
arimathea
and
nicodemus
brought
him
to
a
better
state
of
feeling
and
he
allowed
seraphia
to
follow
our
lord
when
jesus
was
unjustly
accused
in
the
court
of
caiphas
the
husband
of
seraphia
joined
with
joseph
and
nicodemus
in
attempts
to
obtain
the
liberation
of
our
lord
and
all
three
resigned
their
seats
in
the
council
seraphia
was
about
fifty
at
the
time
of
the
triumphant
procession
of
our
lord
when
he
entered
into
jerusalem
on
palm
sunday
and
i
then
saw
her
take
off
her
veil
and
spread
it
on
the
ground
for
him
to
walk
upon
it
was
this
same
veil
which
she
presented
to
jesus
at
this
his
second
procession
a
procession
which
outwardly
appeared
to
be
far
less
glorious
but
was
in
fact
much
more
so
this
veil
obtained
for
her
the
name
of
veronica
and
it
is
still
shown
for
the
veneration
of
the
faithful
chapter
xxxv
the
fourth
and
fifth
falls
of
jesus
the
daughters
of
jerusalem
the
procession
was
still
at
some
distance
from
the
gate
which
was
large
and
attached
to
the
fortifications
and
the
street
was
rough
and
steep
it
had
first
to
pass
under
a
vaulted
arch
then
over
a
bridge
and
finally
under
a
second
arch
the
wall
on
the
left
side
of
the
gate
runs
first
in
southerly
direction
then
deviates
a
little
to
the
west
and
finally
runs
to
the
south
behind
mount
sion
when
the
procession
was
near
this
gate
the
brutal
archers
shoved
jesus
into
a
stagnant
pool
which
was
close
to
it
simon
of
cyrene
in
his
endeavours
to
avoid
the
pool
gave
the
cross
a
twist
which
caused
jesus
to
fall
down
for
the
fourth
time
in
the
midst
of
the
dirty
mud
and
simon
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
lifting
up
the
cross
again
jesus
then
exclaimed
in
a
tone
which
although
clear
was
moving
and
sad
jerusalem
how
often
would
i
have
gathered
together
thy
children
as
the
hen
doth
gather
her
chickens
under
her
wings
and
thou
wouldst
not
when
the
pharisees
heard
these
words
they
became
still
more
angry
and
recommencing
their
insults
and
blows
endeavoured
to
force
him
to
get
up
out
of
the
mud
their
cruelty
to
jesus
so
exasperated
simon
of
cyrene
that
he
at
last
exclaimed
you
continue
this
brutal
conduct
i
will
throw
down
the
cross
and
carry
it
no
farther
i
will
do
so
if
you
kill
me
for
it
a
narrow
and
stony
path
was
visible
as
soon
as
the
gate
was
passed
and
this
path
ran
in
a
northerly
direction
and
led
to
calvary
the
high
road
from
which
it
deviates
divided
shortly
after
into
three
branches
one
to
the
which
led
to
bethlehem
through
the
vale
of
gihon
a
second
to
the
south
towards
emmaus
and
joppa
a
third
likewise
to
the
wound
round
calvary
and
terminated
at
the
gate
which
led
to
bethsur
a
person
standing
at
the
gate
through
which
jesus
was
led
might
easily
see
the
gate
of
bethlehem
the
officers
had
fastened
an
inscription
upon
a
post
which
stood
at
the
commencement
of
the
road
to
calvary
to
inform
those
who
passed
by
that
jesus
and
the
two
thieves
were
condemned
to
death
a
group
of
women
had
gathered
together
near
this
spot
and
were
weeping
and
lamenting
many
carried
young
children
in
their
arms
the
greatest
part
were
young
maidens
and
women
from
jerusalem
who
had
preceded
the
procession
but
a
few
came
from
bethlehem
from
hebron
and
from
other
neighbouring
places
in
order
to
celebrate
the
pasch
jesus
was
on
the
point
of
again
falling
but
simon
who
was
behind
perceiving
that
he
could
not
stand
hastened
to
support
him
he
leant
upon
simon
and
was
thus
saved
from
falling
to
the
ground
when
the
women
and
children
of
whom
we
have
spoken
above
saw
the
deplorable
condition
to
which
our
lord
was
reduced
they
uttered
loud
cries
wept
and
according
to
the
jewish
custom
presented
him
cloths
to
wipe
his
face
jesus
turned
towards
them
and
said
of
jerusalem
weep
not
over
me
but
weep
for
yourselves
and
for
your
children
for
behold
the
days
shall
come
wherein
they
will
say
blessed
are
the
barren
and
the
wombs
that
have
not
borne
and
the
papas
that
have
not
given
suck
then
shall
they
begin
to
say
to
the
mountains
fall
upon
us
and
to
the
hills
cover
us
for
if
in
the
green
wood
they
do
these
things
what
shall
be
done
in
the
dry
he
then
addressed
a
few
words
of
consolation
to
hem
which
i
do
not
exactly
remember
the
procession
made
a
momentary
halt
the
executioners
who
set
of
first
had
reached
calvary
with
the
instruments
for
the
execution
and
were
followed
by
a
hundred
of
the
roman
soldiers
who
had
started
with
pilate
he
only
accompanied
the
procession
as
far
as
the
gateway
and
returned
to
the
town
chapter
xxxvi
jesus
on
mount
golgotha
sixth
and
seventh
falls
of
jesus
the
procession
again
moved
on
the
road
was
very
steep
and
rough
between
the
walls
of
the
town
and
calvary
and
jesus
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
walking
with
his
heavy
burden
on
his
shoulders
but
his
cruel
enemies
far
from
feeling
the
slightest
compassion
or
giving
the
least
assistance
continued
to
urge
him
on
by
the
infliction
of
hard
blows
and
the
utterance
of
dreadful
curses
at
last
they
reached
a
spot
where
the
pathway
turned
suddenly
to
the
south
here
he
stumbled
and
fell
for
the
sixth
time
the
fall
was
a
dreadful
one
but
the
guards
only
struck
him
the
harder
to
force
him
to
get
up
and
no
sooner
did
he
reach
calvary
that
he
sank
down
again
for
the
seventh
time
simon
of
cyrene
was
filled
with
indignation
and
pity
notwithstanding
his
fatigue
he
wished
to
remain
that
he
might
assist
jesus
but
the
archers
first
reviled
and
then
drove
him
away
and
he
soon
after
joined
the
body
of
disciples
the
executioners
then
ordered
the
workmen
and
the
boys
who
had
carried
the
instruments
of
the
execution
to
depart
and
the
pharisees
soon
arrived
for
they
were
on
horseback
and
had
taken
the
smooth
and
easy
road
which
ran
to
the
east
of
calvary
there
was
a
fine
view
of
the
whole
town
of
jerusalem
from
the
top
of
calvary
this
top
was
circular
and
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
ridingschool
surrounded
by
a
low
wall
and
with
five
separate
entrances
this
appeared
to
be
the
usual
number
in
those
parts
for
there
were
five
roads
at
the
baths
at
the
place
where
they
baptised
at
the
pool
of
bethsaida
and
there
were
likewise
many
towns
with
five
gates
in
this
as
in
many
other
peculiarities
of
the
holy
land
there
was
a
deep
prophetic
signification
that
number
five
which
so
often
occurred
was
a
type
of
those
five
sacred
wound
of
our
blessed
saviour
which
were
to
open
to
us
the
gates
of
heaven
the
horsemen
stopped
on
the
west
side
of
the
mount
where
the
declivity
was
not
so
steep
for
the
side
up
which
the
criminals
were
brought
was
both
rough
and
steep
about
a
hundred
soldiers
were
stationed
on
different
parts
of
the
mountain
and
as
space
was
required
the
thieves
were
not
brought
to
the
top
but
ordered
to
halt
before
they
reached
it
and
to
lie
on
the
ground
with
their
arms
fastened
to
their
crosses
soldiers
stood
around
and
guarded
them
while
crowds
of
persons
who
did
not
fear
defiling
themselves
stood
near
the
platform
or
on
the
neighbouring
heights
these
were
mostly
of
the
lower
classes
strangers
slaves
and
pagans
and
a
number
of
them
were
women
it
wanted
about
a
quarter
to
twelve
when
jesus
loaded
with
his
cross
sank
down
at
the
precise
spot
where
he
was
to
be
crucified
the
barbarous
executioners
dragged
him
up
by
the
cords
which
they
had
fastened
round
his
waist
and
then
untied
the
arms
of
the
cross
and
threw
them
on
the
ground
the
sight
of
our
blessed
lord
at
this
moment
was
indeed
calculated
to
move
the
hardest
heart
to
compassion
he
stood
or
rather
bent
over
the
cross
being
scarcely
able
to
support
himself
his
heavenly
countenance
was
pale
and
was
as
that
of
a
person
on
the
verge
of
death
although
wounds
and
blood
disfigured
it
to
a
frightful
degree
but
the
hearts
of
these
cruel
men
were
alas
harder
than
iron
itself
and
far
from
showing
the
slightest
commiseration
they
threw
him
brutally
down
exclaiming
in
a
jeering
tone
powerful
king
we
are
about
to
prepare
thy
throne
jesus
immediately
placed
himself
upon
the
cross
and
they
measured
him
and
marked
the
places
for
his
feet
and
hands
whilst
the
pharisees
continued
to
insult
their
unresisting
victim
when
the
measurement
was
finished
they
led
him
to
a
cave
cut
in
the
rock
which
had
been
used
formerly
as
a
cellar
opened
the
door
and
pushed
him
in
so
roughly
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
support
of
angels
his
legs
must
have
been
broken
by
so
hard
a
fall
on
the
rough
stone
floor
i
most
distinctly
heard
his
groans
of
pain
but
they
closed
the
door
quickly
and
placed
guards
before
it
and
the
archers
continued
their
preparations
for
the
crucifixion
the
centre
of
the
platform
mentioned
above
was
the
most
elevated
part
of
calvary
it
was
a
round
eminence
about
two
feet
high
and
persons
were
obliged
to
ascend
two
of
three
steps
to
reach
its
top
the
executioners
dug
the
holes
for
the
three
crosses
at
the
top
of
this
eminence
and
placed
those
intended
for
the
thieves
one
on
the
right
and
the
other
on
the
left
of
our
lord
both
were
lower
and
more
roughly
made
than
his
they
then
carried
the
cross
of
our
saviour
to
the
spot
where
they
intended
to
crucify
him
and
placed
it
in
such
a
position
that
it
would
easily
fall
into
the
hole
prepared
for
it
they
fastened
the
two
arms
strongly
on
to
the
body
of
the
cross
nailed
the
board
at
the
bottom
which
was
to
support
the
feet
bored
the
holes
for
the
nails
and
cut
different
hollows
in
the
wood
in
the
parts
which
would
receive
the
head
and
back
of
our
lord
in
order
that
his
body
might
rest
against
the
cross
instead
of
being
suspended
from
it
their
aim
in
this
was
the
prolongation
of
his
tortures
for
if
the
whole
weight
of
this
body
was
allowed
to
fall
upon
the
hands
the
holes
might
be
quite
torn
open
and
death
ensue
more
speedily
than
they
desired
the
executioners
then
drove
into
the
ground
the
pieces
of
wood
which
were
intended
to
keep
the
cross
upright
and
made
a
few
other
similar
preparations
chapter
xxxvii
the
departure
of
mary
and
the
holy
women
of
calvary
although
the
blessed
virgin
was
carried
away
fainting
after
the
sad
meeting
with
her
son
loaded
with
his
cross
yet
she
soon
recovered
consciousness
for
love
and
the
ardent
desire
of
seeing
him
once
more
imparted
to
her
a
supernatural
feeling
of
strength
accompanied
by
her
companions
she
went
to
the
house
of
lazarus
which
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
town
and
where
martha
magdalen
and
many
holy
women
were
already
assembled
all
were
sad
and
depressed
but
magdalen
could
not
restrain
her
tears
and
lamentations
they
started
from
this
house
about
seventeen
in
number
to
make
the
way
of
the
cross
that
is
to
say
to
follow
every
step
jesus
had
taken
in
this
most
painful
journey
mary
counted
each
footstep
and
being
interiorly
enlightened
pointed
out
to
her
companions
those
places
which
had
been
consecrated
by
peculiar
sufferings
then
did
the
sharp
sword
predicted
by
aged
simeon
impress
for
the
first
time
in
the
heart
of
mary
that
touching
devotion
which
has
since
been
so
constantly
practised
in
the
church
mary
imparted
it
to
her
companions
and
they
in
their
turn
left
it
to
future
generations
a
most
precious
gift
indeed
bestowed
by
our
lord
on
his
beloved
mother
and
which
passed
from
her
heart
to
the
hearts
of
her
children
through
the
revered
voice
of
tradition
when
these
holy
women
reached
the
house
of
veronica
they
entered
it
because
pilate
and
his
officers
were
at
that
moment
passing
through
the
street
on
their
way
home
they
burst
forth
into
unrestrained
tears
when
they
beheld
the
countenance
of
jesus
imprinted
on
the
veil
and
they
returned
thanks
to
god
for
the
favour
he
had
bestowed
on
his
faithful
servant
they
took
the
jar
of
aromatic
wine
which
the
jews
had
prevented
jesus
from
drinking
and
set
off
together
towards
golgotha
their
number
was
considerably
increased
for
many
pious
men
and
women
whom
the
sufferings
of
our
lord
had
filled
with
pity
had
joined
them
and
they
ascended
the
west
side
of
calvary
as
the
declivity
there
was
not
so
great
the
mother
of
jesus
accompanied
by
her
niece
mary
the
daughter
of
cleophas
john
and
salome
went
quite
up
to
the
round
platform
but
martha
mary
of
heli
veronica
johanna
chusa
susanna
and
mary
the
mother
of
mark
remained
below
with
magdalen
who
could
hardly
support
herself
lower
down
on
the
mountain
there
was
a
third
group
of
holy
women
and
there
were
a
few
scattered
individuals
between
the
three
groups
who
carried
messages
from
one
to
the
other
the
pharisees
on
horseback
rode
to
and
fro
among
the
people
and
the
five
entrances
were
guarded
by
roman
soldiers
mary
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
fatal
spot
and
stood
as
if
entranced
it
was
indeed
a
sight
calculated
to
appal
and
rend
the
heart
of
a
mother
there
lay
the
terrible
cross
the
hammers
the
ropes
the
nails
and
alongside
of
these
frightful
instruments
to
torture
stood
the
brutal
executioners
half
drunk
and
almost
without
clothing
swearing
and
blaspheming
whilst
making
their
preparations
the
sufferings
of
the
blessed
virgin
were
greatly
increased
by
her
not
being
able
to
see
her
son
she
knew
that
he
was
still
alive
and
she
felt
the
most
ardent
desire
once
more
to
behold
him
while
the
thought
of
the
torments
he
still
had
to
endure
made
her
heart
ready
to
burst
with
grief
a
little
hail
had
been
falling
at
times
during
the
morning
but
the
sun
came
out
again
after
ten
and
a
thick
red
fog
began
to
obscure
it
towards
twelve
chapter
xxxviii
the
nailing
of
jesus
to
the
cross
the
preparations
for
the
crucifixion
being
finished
four
archers
went
to
the
cave
where
they
had
confined
our
lord
and
dragged
him
out
with
their
usual
brutality
while
the
mob
looked
on
and
made
use
of
insulting
language
and
the
roman
soldiers
regarded
all
with
indifference
and
thought
of
nothing
but
maintaining
order
when
jesus
was
again
brought
forth
the
holy
women
gave
a
man
some
money
and
begged
him
to
pay
the
archer
anything
they
might
demand
if
they
would
allow
jesus
to
drink
the
wine
which
veronica
had
prepared
but
the
cruel
executioners
instead
of
giving
it
to
jesus
drank
it
themselves
they
had
brought
two
vases
with
them
one
of
which
contained
vinegar
and
gall
and
the
other
a
mixture
which
looked
like
wine
mixed
with
myrrh
and
absinthe
they
offered
a
glass
of
the
latter
to
our
lord
which
he
tasted
but
would
not
drink
there
were
eighteen
archers
on
the
platform
the
six
who
had
scourged
jesus
the
four
who
had
conducted
him
to
calvary
the
two
who
held
the
ropes
which
supported
the
cross
and
six
others
who
came
for
the
purpose
of
crucifying
him
they
were
strangers
in
the
pay
of
either
the
jews
or
the
romans
and
were
short
men
with
most
ferocious
countenances
rather
resembling
wild
beasts
than
human
beings
and
employing
themselves
alternately
in
drinking
and
in
making
preparations
for
the
crucifixion
this
scene
was
rendered
the
more
frightful
to
me
by
the
sight
of
demons
who
were
invisible
to
others
and
i
saw
large
bodies
of
evil
spirits
under
the
forms
of
toads
serpents
dragons
and
venomous
insects
urging
these
wicked
men
to
still
greater
cruelty
and
perfectly
darkening
the
air
they
crept
into
the
mouths
and
into
the
hearts
of
the
assistants
sat
upon
their
shoulders
filled
their
minds
with
wicked
images
and
incited
them
to
revile
and
insult
our
lord
with
still
greater
brutality
weeping
angels
however
stood
around
jesus
and
the
sight
of
their
tears
consoled
me
not
a
little
and
they
were
accompanied
by
little
angels
of
glory
whose
heads
alone
i
saw
there
were
likewise
angels
of
pity
and
angels
of
consolation
among
them
the
latter
frequently
approached
the
blessed
virgin
and
the
rest
of
the
pious
persons
who
were
assembled
there
and
whispered
words
of
comfort
which
enabled
them
to
bear
up
with
firmness
the
executioners
soon
pulled
off
our
lord
cloak
the
belt
to
which
the
ropes
were
fastened
and
his
own
belt
when
they
found
it
was
impossible
to
drag
the
woollen
garment
which
his
mother
had
woven
for
him
over
his
head
on
account
of
the
crown
of
thorns
they
tore
off
this
most
painful
crown
thus
reopening
every
wound
and
seizing
the
garment
tore
it
mercilessly
over
his
bleeding
and
wounded
head
our
dear
lord
and
saviour
then
stood
before
his
cruel
enemies
stripped
of
all
save
the
short
scapular
which
was
on
his
shoulders
and
the
linen
which
girded
his
loins
his
scapular
was
of
wool
the
wool
had
stuck
to
the
wounds
and
indescribable
was
the
agony
of
pain
he
suffered
when
they
pulled
it
roughly
off
he
shook
like
the
aspen
as
he
stood
before
them
for
he
was
so
weakened
from
suffering
and
loss
of
blood
that
he
could
not
support
himself
for
more
than
a
few
moments
he
was
covered
with
open
wounds
and
his
shoulders
and
back
were
torn
to
the
bone
by
the
dreadful
scourging
he
had
endured
he
was
about
to
fall
when
the
executioners
fearing
that
he
might
die
and
thus
deprive
them
of
the
barbarous
pleasure
of
crucifying
him
led
him
to
a
large
stone
and
placed
him
roughly
down
upon
it
but
no
sooner
was
he
seated
than
they
aggravated
his
sufferings
by
putting
the
crown
of
thorns
again
upon
his
head
they
then
offered
him
some
vinegar
and
gall
from
which
however
he
turned
away
in
silence
the
executioners
did
not
allow
him
to
rest
long
but
bade
him
rise
and
place
himself
on
the
cross
that
they
might
nail
him
to
it
then
seizing
his
right
arm
they
dragged
it
to
the
hole
prepared
for
the
nail
and
having
tied
it
tightly
down
with
a
cord
one
of
them
knelt
upon
his
sacred
chest
a
second
held
his
hand
flat
and
a
third
taking
a
long
thick
nail
pressed
it
on
the
open
palm
of
that
adorable
hand
which
had
ever
been
open
to
bestow
blessings
and
favours
on
the
ungrateful
jews
and
with
a
great
iron
hammer
drove
it
through
the
flesh
and
far
into
the
wood
of
the
cross
our
lord
uttered
one
deep
but
suppressed
groan
and
his
blood
gushed
forth
and
sprinkled
the
arms
of
the
archers
i
counted
the
blows
of
the
hammer
but
my
extreme
grief
made
me
forget
their
number
the
nails
were
very
large
the
heads
about
the
size
of
a
crown
piece
and
the
thickness
that
of
a
man
thumb
while
the
points
came
through
at
the
back
of
the
cross
the
blessed
virgin
stood
motionless
from
time
to
time
you
might
distinguish
her
plaintive
moans
she
appeared
as
if
almost
fainting
from
grief
and
magdalen
was
quite
beside
herself
when
the
executioners
had
nailed
the
right
hand
of
our
lord
they
perceived
that
his
left
hand
did
not
reach
the
hole
they
had
bored
to
receive
the
nail
therefore
they
tied
ropes
to
his
left
arm
and
having
steadied
their
feet
against
the
cross
pulled
the
left
hand
violently
until
it
reached
the
place
prepared
for
it
this
dreadful
process
caused
our
lord
indescribable
agony
his
breast
heaved
and
his
legs
were
quite
contracted
they
again
knelt
upon
him
tied
down
his
arms
and
drove
the
second
nail
into
his
left
hand
his
blood
flowed
afresh
and
his
feeble
groans
were
once
more
heard
between
the
blows
of
the
hammer
but
nothing
could
move
the
executioners
to
the
slightest
pity
the
arms
of
jesus
thus
unnaturally
stretched
out
no
longer
covered
the
arms
of
the
cross
which
were
sloped
there
was
a
wide
space
between
them
and
his
armpits
each
additional
torture
and
insult
inflicted
on
our
lord
caused
a
fresh
pang
in
the
heart
of
his
blessed
mother
she
became
white
as
a
corpse
but
as
the
pharisees
endeavoured
to
increase
her
pain
by
insulting
words
and
gestures
the
disciples
led
her
to
a
group
of
pious
women
who
were
standing
a
little
farther
off
the
executioners
had
fastened
a
piece
of
wood
at
the
lower
part
of
the
cross
under
where
the
feet
of
jesus
would
be
nailed
that
thus
the
weight
of
his
body
might
not
rest
upon
the
wounds
of
his
hands
as
also
to
prevent
the
bones
of
his
feet
from
being
broken
when
nailed
to
the
cross
a
hole
had
been
pierced
in
this
wood
to
receive
the
nail
when
driven
through
his
feet
and
there
was
likewise
a
little
hollow
place
for
his
heels
these
precautions
were
taken
lest
his
wounds
should
be
torn
open
by
the
weight
of
this
body
and
death
ensue
before
he
had
suffered
all
the
tortures
which
they
hoped
to
see
him
endure
the
whole
body
of
our
lord
had
been
dragged
upward
and
contracted
by
the
violent
manner
with
which
the
executioners
had
stretched
out
his
arms
and
his
knees
were
bent
up
they
therefore
flattened
and
tied
them
down
tightly
with
cords
but
soon
perceiving
that
his
feet
did
not
reach
the
bit
of
wood
which
was
placed
for
them
to
rest
upon
they
became
infuriated
some
of
their
number
proposed
making
fresh
holes
for
the
nails
which
pierced
his
hands
as
there
would
be
considerable
difficulty
in
removing
the
bit
of
wood
but
the
others
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
and
continued
to
vociferate
will
not
stretch
himself
out
but
we
will
help
him
they
accompanied
these
words
with
the
most
fearful
oaths
and
imprecations
and
having
fastened
a
rope
to
his
right
leg
dragged
it
violently
until
it
reached
the
wood
and
then
tied
it
down
as
tightly
as
possible
the
agony
which
jesus
suffered
from
this
violent
tension
was
indescribable
the
words
god
my
god
escaped
his
lips
and
the
executioners
increased
his
pain
by
tying
his
chest
and
arms
to
the
cross
lest
the
hands
should
be
torn
from
the
nails
they
then
fastened
his
left
foot
on
to
his
right
foot
having
first
bored
a
hole
through
them
with
a
species
of
piercer
because
they
could
not
be
placed
in
such
a
position
as
to
be
nailed
together
at
once
next
they
took
a
very
long
nail
and
drove
it
completely
through
both
feet
into
the
cross
below
which
operation
was
more
than
usually
painful
on
account
of
his
body
being
so
unnaturally
stretched
out
i
counted
at
least
six
and
thirty
blows
of
the
hammer
during
the
whole
time
of
the
crucifixion
our
lord
never
ceased
praying
and
repeating
those
passages
in
the
psalms
which
he
was
then
accompanying
although
from
time
to
time
a
feeble
moan
caused
by
excess
of
suffering
might
be
heard
in
this
manner
he
had
prayed
when
carrying
his
cross
and
thus
he
continued
to
pray
until
his
death
i
heard
him
repeat
all
these
prophecies
i
repeated
them
after
him
and
i
have
often
since
noted
the
different
passages
when
reading
the
psalms
but
i
now
feel
so
exhausted
with
grief
that
i
can
not
at
all
connect
them
when
the
crucifixion
of
jesus
was
finished
the
commander
of
the
roman
soldiers
ordered
pilate
inscription
to
be
nailed
on
the
top
of
the
cross
the
pharisees
were
much
incensed
at
this
and
their
anger
was
increased
by
the
jeers
of
the
roman
soldiers
who
pointed
at
their
crucified
king
they
therefore
hastened
back
to
jerusalem
determined
to
use
their
best
endeavours
to
persuade
the
governor
to
allow
them
to
substitute
another
inscription
it
was
about
a
quarter
past
twelve
when
jesus
was
crucified
and
at
the
moment
the
cross
was
lifted
up
the
temple
resounded
with
the
blast
of
trumpets
which
were
always
blown
to
announce
the
sacrifice
of
the
paschal
lamb
chapter
xxxix
raising
of
the
cross
when
the
executioners
had
finished
the
crucifixion
of
our
lord
they
tied
ropes
to
the
trunk
of
the
cross
and
fastened
the
ends
of
these
ropes
round
a
long
beam
which
was
fixed
firmly
in
the
ground
at
a
little
distance
and
by
means
of
these
ropes
they
raised
the
cross
some
of
their
number
supported
it
while
others
shoved
its
foot
towards
the
hole
prepared
for
its
reception
the
heavy
cross
fell
into
this
hole
with
a
frightful
shock
jesus
uttered
a
faint
cry
and
his
wounds
were
torn
open
in
the
most
fearful
manner
his
blood
again
burst
forth
and
his
half
dislocated
bones
knocked
one
against
the
other
the
archers
pushed
the
cross
to
get
it
thoroughly
into
the
hole
and
caused
it
to
vibrate
still
more
by
planting
five
stakes
around
to
support
it
a
terrible
but
at
the
same
time
a
touching
sight
it
was
to
behold
the
cross
raised
up
in
the
midst
of
the
vast
concourse
of
persons
who
were
assembled
all
around
not
only
insulting
soldiers
proud
pharisees
and
the
brutal
jewish
mob
were
there
but
likewise
strangers
from
all
parts
the
air
resounded
with
acclamations
and
derisive
cries
when
they
beheld
it
towering
on
high
and
after
vibrating
for
a
moment
in
the
air
fall
with
a
heavy
crash
into
the
hole
cut
for
it
in
the
rock
but
words
of
love
and
compassion
resounded
through
the
air
at
the
same
moment
and
need
we
say
that
these
words
these
sounds
were
emitted
by
the
most
saintly
of
human
beings
mary
john
the
holy
women
and
all
who
were
pure
of
heart
they
bowed
down
and
adored
the
made
flesh
nailed
to
the
cross
they
stretched
forth
their
hands
as
if
desirous
of
giving
assistance
to
the
holy
of
holies
whom
they
beheld
nailed
to
a
cross
and
in
the
power
of
his
furious
enemies
but
when
the
solemn
sound
of
the
fall
of
the
cross
into
the
hole
prepared
for
it
in
the
rock
was
heard
a
dead
silence
ensued
every
heart
was
filled
with
an
indefinable
feeling
of
awe
a
feeling
never
before
experienced
and
for
which
no
one
could
account
even
to
himself
all
the
inmates
of
hell
shook
with
terror
and
vented
their
rage
by
endeavouring
to
stimulate
the
enemies
of
jesus
to
still
greater
fury
and
brutality
the
souls
in
limbo
were
filled
with
joy
and
hope
for
the
sound
was
to
them
a
harbinger
of
happiness
the
prelude
to
the
appearance
of
their
deliverer
thus
was
the
blessed
cross
of
our
lord
planted
for
the
first
time
on
the
earth
and
well
might
it
be
compared
to
the
tree
of
life
in
paradise
for
the
wounds
of
jesus
were
as
sacred
fountains
from
which
flowed
four
rivers
destined
both
to
purify
the
world
from
the
curse
of
sin
and
to
give
it
fertility
so
as
to
produce
fruit
unto
salvation
the
eminence
on
which
the
cross
was
planted
was
about
two
feet
higher
than
the
surrounding
parts
the
feet
of
jesus
were
sufficiently
near
the
ground
for
his
friends
to
be
able
to
reach
to
kiss
them
and
his
face
was
turned
to
the
chapter
xl
crucifixion
of
the
thieves
during
the
time
of
the
crucifixion
of
jesus
the
two
thieves
were
left
lying
on
the
ground
at
some
distance
off
their
arms
were
fastened
to
the
crosses
on
which
they
were
to
be
executed
and
a
few
soldiers
stood
near
on
guard
the
accusation
which
had
been
proved
against
them
was
that
of
having
assassinated
a
jewish
woman
who
with
her
children
was
travelling
from
jerusalem
to
joppa
they
were
arrested
under
the
disguise
of
rich
merchants
at
a
castle
in
which
pilate
resided
occasionally
when
employed
in
exercising
his
troops
and
they
had
been
imprisoned
for
a
long
time
before
being
brought
to
trial
the
thief
placed
on
the
side
was
much
older
than
the
other
a
regular
miscreant
who
had
corrupted
the
younger
they
were
commonly
called
dismas
and
gesmas
and
as
i
forget
their
real
names
i
shall
distinguish
them
by
these
terms
calling
the
good
one
dismas
and
the
wicked
one
gesmas
both
the
one
and
the
other
belonged
to
a
band
of
robbers
who
infested
the
frontiers
of
egypt
and
it
was
in
a
cave
inhabited
by
these
robbers
that
the
holy
family
took
refuge
when
flying
into
egypt
at
the
time
of
the
massacre
of
the
innocents
the
poor
leprous
child
who
was
instantly
cleansed
by
being
dipped
in
the
water
which
had
been
used
for
washing
the
infant
jesus
was
no
other
than
this
dismas
and
the
charity
of
his
mother
in
receiving
and
granting
hospitality
to
the
holy
family
had
been
rewarded
by
the
cure
of
her
child
while
this
outward
purification
was
an
emblem
of
the
inward
purification
which
was
afterwards
accomplished
in
the
soul
of
dismas
on
mount
calvary
through
that
sacred
blood
which
was
then
shed
on
the
cross
for
our
redemption
dismas
knew
nothing
at
all
about
jesus
but
as
his
heart
was
not
hardened
the
sight
of
the
extreme
patience
of
our
lord
moved
him
much
when
the
executioners
had
finished
putting
up
the
cross
of
jesus
they
ordered
the
thieves
to
rise
without
delay
and
they
loosened
their
fetters
in
order
to
crucify
them
at
once
as
the
sky
was
becoming
very
cloudy
and
bore
every
appearance
of
an
approaching
storm
after
giving
them
some
myrrh
and
vinegar
they
stripped
off
their
ragged
clothing
tied
ropes
round
their
arms
and
by
the
help
of
small
ladders
dragged
them
up
to
their
places
on
the
cross
the
executioners
then
bound
the
arms
of
the
thieves
to
the
cross
with
cords
made
of
the
bark
of
trees
and
fastened
their
wrists
elbows
knees
and
feet
in
like
manner
drawing
the
cords
so
tight
that
their
joints
cracked
and
the
blood
burst
out
they
uttered
piercing
cries
and
the
good
thief
exclaimed
as
they
were
drawing
him
up
torture
is
dreadful
but
if
they
had
treated
us
as
they
treated
the
poor
galilean
we
should
have
been
dead
long
ago
the
executioners
had
divided
the
garments
of
jesus
in
order
to
draw
lots
for
them
his
mantle
which
was
narrow
at
the
top
was
very
wide
at
the
bottom
and
lined
over
the
chest
thus
forming
a
pocket
between
the
lining
and
the
material
itself
the
lining
they
pulled
out
tore
into
bands
and
divided
they
did
the
same
with
his
long
white
robe
belt
scapular
and
which
was
completely
saturated
with
his
sacred
blood
not
being
able
to
agree
as
to
who
was
to
be
the
possessor
of
the
seamless
robe
woven
by
his
mother
which
could
not
be
cut
up
and
divided
they
brought
out
a
species
of
chessboard
marked
with
figures
and
were
about
to
decide
the
point
by
lots
when
a
messenger
sent
by
nicodemus
and
joseph
of
arimathea
informed
them
that
there
were
persons
ready
to
purchase
all
the
clothes
of
jesus
they
therefore
gathered
them
together
and
sold
them
in
a
bundle
thus
did
the
christians
get
possession
of
these
precious
relics
chapter
xli
jesus
hanging
on
the
cross
between
two
thieves
the
tremendous
concussion
caused
by
the
fall
of
the
cross
into
the
hole
prepared
for
it
drove
the
sharp
points
of
the
crown
of
thorns
which
was
still
upon
the
head
of
our
dear
saviour
still
deeper
into
his
sacred
flesh
and
blood
ran
down
again
in
streams
both
from
it
and
from
his
hands
and
feet
the
archers
then
placed
ladders
against
the
sides
of
the
cross
mounted
them
and
unfastened
the
ropes
with
which
they
had
bound
our
lord
to
the
cross
previous
to
lifting
it
up
fearing
that
the
shock
might
tear
open
the
wounds
in
his
hands
and
feet
and
that
then
the
nails
would
no
longer
support
his
body
his
blood
had
become
in
a
certain
degree
stagnated
by
his
horizontal
position
and
the
pressure
of
the
cords
but
when
these
were
withdrawn
it
resumed
its
usual
course
and
caused
such
agonising
sensations
throughout
his
countless
wounds
that
he
bowed
his
head
and
remained
as
if
dead
for
more
than
seven
minutes
a
pause
ensued
the
executioners
were
occupied
with
the
division
of
his
garments
the
trumpets
in
the
temple
no
longer
resounded
and
all
the
actors
in
this
fearful
tragedy
appeared
to
be
exhausted
some
by
grief
and
others
by
the
efforts
they
had
made
to
compass
their
wicked
ends
and
by
the
joy
which
they
felt
now
at
having
at
last
succeeded
in
bringing
about
the
death
of
him
whom
they
had
so
long
envied
with
mixed
feelings
of
fear
and
compassion
i
cast
my
eyes
upon
jesus
jesus
my
redeemer
the
redeemer
of
the
world
i
beheld
him
motionless
and
almost
lifeless
i
felt
as
if
i
myself
must
expire
my
heart
was
overwhelmed
between
grief
love
and
horror
my
mind
was
half
wandering
my
hands
and
feet
burning
with
a
feverish
heat
each
vein
nerve
and
limb
was
racked
with
inexpressible
pain
i
saw
nothing
distinctly
excepting
my
beloved
spouse
hanging
on
the
cross
i
contemplated
his
disfigured
countenance
his
head
encircled
with
that
terrible
crown
of
thorns
which
prevented
his
raising
it
even
for
a
moment
without
the
most
intense
suffering
his
mouth
parched
and
half
open
from
exhaustion
and
his
hair
and
beard
clotted
with
blood
his
chest
was
torn
with
stripes
and
wounds
and
his
elbows
wrists
and
shoulders
so
violently
distended
as
to
be
almost
dislocated
blood
constantly
trickled
down
from
the
gaping
wounds
in
his
hands
and
the
flesh
was
so
torn
from
his
ribs
that
you
might
almost
count
them
his
legs
and
thighs
as
also
his
arms
were
stretched
out
almost
to
dislocation
the
flesh
and
muscles
so
completely
laid
bare
that
every
bone
was
visible
and
his
whole
body
covered
with
black
green
and
reeking
wounds
the
blood
which
flowed
from
his
wounds
was
at
first
red
but
it
became
by
degrees
light
and
watery
and
the
whole
appearance
of
his
body
was
that
of
a
corpse
ready
for
interment
and
yet
notwithstanding
the
horrible
wounds
with
which
he
was
covered
notwithstanding
the
state
of
ignominy
to
which
he
was
reduced
there
still
remained
that
inexpressible
look
of
dignity
and
goodness
which
had
ever
filled
all
beholders
with
awe
the
complexion
of
our
lord
was
fair
like
that
of
mary
and
slightly
tinted
with
red
but
his
exposure
to
the
weather
during
the
last
three
years
had
tanned
him
considerably
his
chest
was
wide
but
not
hairy
like
that
of
john
baptist
his
shoulders
broad
and
his
arms
and
thighs
sinewy
his
knees
were
strong
and
hardened
as
is
usually
the
case
with
those
who
have
either
walked
or
knelt
much
and
his
legs
long
with
very
strong
muscles
his
feet
were
well
formed
and
his
hands
beautiful
the
fingers
being
long
and
tapering
and
although
not
delicate
like
those
of
a
woman
still
not
resembling
those
of
a
man
who
had
laboured
hard
his
neck
was
rather
long
with
a
and
finely
proportioned
head
his
forehead
large
and
high
his
face
oval
his
hair
which
was
far
from
thick
was
of
a
golden
brown
colour
parted
in
the
middle
and
falling
over
his
shoulders
his
beard
was
not
any
great
length
but
pointed
and
divided
under
the
chin
when
i
contemplated
him
on
the
cross
his
hair
was
almost
all
torn
off
and
what
remained
was
matted
and
clotted
with
blood
his
body
was
one
wound
and
every
limb
seemed
as
if
dislocated
the
crosses
of
the
two
thieves
were
placed
the
one
to
the
right
and
the
other
to
the
left
of
jesus
there
was
sufficient
space
left
for
a
horseman
to
ride
between
them
nothing
can
be
imagined
more
distressing
than
the
appearance
of
the
thieves
on
their
crosses
they
suffered
terribly
and
the
one
on
the
side
never
ceased
cursing
and
swearing
the
cords
with
which
they
were
tied
were
very
tight
and
caused
great
pain
their
countenances
were
livid
and
their
eyes
enflamed
and
ready
to
start
from
the
sockets
the
height
of
the
crosses
of
the
two
thieves
was
much
less
than
that
of
our
lord

as
soon
as
the
executioners
had
crucified
the
two
thieves
and
divided
the
garment
of
jesus
between
them
they
gathered
up
their
tools
addressed
a
few
more
insulting
words
to
our
lord
and
went
away
the
pharisees
likewise
rode
up
to
jesus
looked
at
him
scornfully
made
use
of
some
opprobrious
expression
and
then
left
the
place
the

of
whom
a
hundred
had
been
posted
round
calvary
were
marched
away
and
their
places

whom
was

arab
by
birth
who
afterwards
took
the

ctesiphon
in

and
the
second
in
command
was
cassius
who
when
he
became
a
christian
was
known
by
the
name
of
longinus
pilate
frequently
made
use
of
him
as
a
messenger
twelve
pharisees
twelve
sadducees
as
many
scribes
and
a
few
ancients
accompanied
by
those
jews
who
had
been
endeavouring
to
persuade
pilate
to
change
the
inscription
on
the
cross
of
jesus
then
came
up
they
were
furious
as
the
roman
governor
had
given
them
a
direct
refusal
they
rode
round
the
platform
and
drove
away
the
blessed
virgin
whom
john
led
to
the
holy
women
when
they
passed
the
cross
of
jesus
they
shook
their
heads
disdainfully
at
him
exclaiming
at
the
same
time
thou
that
destroyest
the
temple
of
god
and
in
three
days
buildest
it
up
again
save
thyself
coming
down
from
the
cross
let
christ
the
king
of
israel
come
down
now
from
the
cross
that
we
may
see
and
believe
the
soldiers
likewise
made
use
of
deriding
language
the
countenance
and
whole
body
of
jesus
became
even
more
colourless
he
appeared
to
be
on
the
point
of
fainting
and
gesmas
the
wicked
thief
exclaimed
demon
by
whom
he
is
possessed
is
about
to
leave
him
a
soldier
then
took
a
sponge
filled
it
with
vinegar
put
it
on
a
reed
and
presented
it
to
jesus
who
appeared
to
drink
thou
art
the
king
of
the
jews
said
the
soldier
thyself
coming
down
from
the
cross
these
things
took
place
during
the
time
that
the
first
band
of
soldiers
was
being
relieved
by
that
of
abenadar
jesus
raised
his
head
a
little
and
said
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
and
gesmas
cried
out
thou
art
the
christ
save
thyself
and
us
dismas
the
good
thief
was
silent
but
he
was
deeply
moved
at
the
prayer
of
jesus
for
his
enemies
when
mary
heard
the
voice
of
her
son
unable
to
restrain
herself
she
rushed
forward
followed
by
john
salome
and
mary
of
cleophas
and
approached
the
cross
which
the
centurion
did
not
prevent
the
prayers
of
jesus
obtained
for
the
good
thief
a
moist
powerful
grace
he
suddenly
remembered
that
it
was
jesus
and
mary
who
had
cured
him
of
leprosy
in
his
childhood
and
he
exclaimed
in
a
loud
and
clear
voice
can
you
insult
him
when
he
prays
for
you
he
has
been
silent
and
suffered
all
your
outrages
with
patience
he
is
truly
a
prophet
he
is
our
king
he
is
the
son
of
god
this
unexpected
reproof
from
the
lips
of
a
miserable
malefactor
who
was
dying
on
a
cross
caused
a
tremendous
commotion
among
the
spectators
they
gathered
up
stones
and
wished
to
throw
them
at
him
but
the
centurion
abenadar
would
not
allow
it
the
blessed
virgin
was
much
comforted
and
strengthened
by
the
prayer
of
jesus
and
dismas
said
to
gesmas
who
was
still
blaspheming
jesus
dost
thou
fear
god
seeing
thou
art
under
the
same
condemnation
and
we
indeed
justly
for
we
receive
the
due
reward
of
our
deeds
but
this
man
hath
done
no
evil
remember
thou
art
now
at
the
point
of
death
and
repent
he
was
enlightened
and
touched
he
confessed
his
sins
to
jesus
and
said
if
thou
condemnest
me
it
will
be
with
justice
and
jesus
replied
shalt
experience
my
mercy
dismas
filled
with
the
most
perfect
contrition
began
instantly
to
thank
god
for
the
great
graces
he
had
received
and
to
reflect
over
the
manifold
sins
of
his
past
life
all
these
events
took
place
between
twelve
and
the
shortly
after
the
crucifixion
but
such
a
surprising
change
had
taken
place
in
the
appearance
of
nature
during
that
time
as
to
astonish
the
beholders
and
fill
their
minds
with
awe

terror

was
shown
the
exact
cause
of
this
wonderful
phenomenon
but
i
have
unfortunately
partly
forgotten
it
and
what
i
have
not
forgotten
i
can
not
find
words
to
express
but
i
was
lifted
up
from
the
earth
and
beheld
the
stars
and
the
planets
moving
about
out
of
their
proper
spheres
i
saw
the
moon
like
an
immense
ball
of
fire
rolling
along
as
if
flying
from
the
earth
i
was
then
suddenly
taken
back
to
jerusalem
and
i
beheld
the
moon
reappear
behind
the
mountain
of
olives
looking
pale
and
full
and
advancing
rapidly
towards
the
sun
which
was
dim
and
by
a
fog
i
saw
to
the
east
of
the
sun
a
large
dark
body
which
had
the
appearance
of
a
mountain
and
which
soon
entirely
hid
the
sun
the
centre
of
this
body
was
dark
yellow
and
a
red
circle
like
a
ring
of
fire
was
round
it
the
sky
grew
darker
and
the
stars
appeared
to
cast
a
red
and
lurid
light
both
men
and
beasts
were
struck
with
terror
the
enemies
of
jesus
ceased
reviling
him
while
the
pharisees
endeavoured
to
give
philosophical
reasons
for
what
was
taking
place
but
they
failed
in
their
attempt
and
were
reduced
to
silence
many
were
seized
with
remorse
struck
their
breasts
and
cried
out
his
blood
fall
upon
his
murderers
numbers
of
others
whether
near
the
cross
or
at
a
distance
fell
on
their
knees
and
entreated
forgiveness
of
jesus
who
turned
his
eyes
compassionately
upon
them
in
the
midst
of
his
sufferings
however
the
darkness
continued
to
increase
and
everyone
excepting
mary
and
the
most
faithful
among
the
friends
of
jesus
left
the
cross
dismas
then
raised
his
head
and
in
a
tone
of
humility
and
hope
said
to
jesus
remember
me
when
thou
shalt
come
into
thy
kingdom
and
jesus
made
answer
i
say
to
thee
this
day
thou
shalt
be
with
me
in
paradise
magdalen
mary
of
cleophas
and
john
stood
near
the
cross
of
our
lord
and
looked
at
him
while
the
blessed
virgin
filled
with
intense
feelings
of
motherly
love
entreated
her
son
to
permit
her
to
die
with
him
but
he
casting
a
look
of
ineffable
tenderness
upon
her
turned
to
john
and
said
behold
thy
son
then
he
said
to
john
thy
mother
john
looked
at
his
dying
redeemer
and
saluted
this
beloved
mother
whom
he
henceforth
considered
as
his
own
in
the
most
respectful
manner
the
blessed
virgin
was
so
overcome
by
grief
at
these
words
of
jesus
that
she
almost
fainted
and
was
carried
to
a
short
distance
from
the
cross
by
the
holy
women
i
do
not
know
whether
jesus
really
pronounced
these
words
but
i
felt
interiorly
that
he
gave
mary
to
john
as
a
mother
and
john
to
mary
as
a
son
in
similar
visions
a
person
is
often
conscious
of
things
which
are
not
written
and
words
can
only
express
a
portion
of
them
although
to
the
individual
to
whom
they
are
shown
they
are
so
clear
as
not
to
require
explanation
for
this
reason
it
did
not
appear
to
me
in
the
least
surprising
that
jesus
should
call
the
blessed
virgin
instead
of
i
felt
that
he
intended
to
demonstrate
that
she
was
that
woman
spoken
of
in
scripture
who
was
to
crush
the
head
of
the
serpent
and
that
then
was
the
moment
in
which
that
promise
was
accomplished
in
the
death
of
her
son
i
knew
that
jesus
by
giving
her
as
a
mother
to
john
gave
her
also
as
a
mother
to
all
who
believe
in
him
who
become
children
of
god
and
are
not
born
of
flesh
and
blood
or
of
the
will
of
man
but
of
god
neither
did
it
appear
to
me
surprising
that
the
most
pure
the
most
humble
and
the
most
obedient
among
women
who
when
saluted
by
the
angel
as
of
grace
immediately
replied
the
handmaid
of
the
lord
be
it
done
to
me
according
to
thy
word
and
in
whose
sacred
womb
the
word
was
instantly
made
flesh
that
she
when
informed
by
her
dying
son
that
she
was
to
become
the
spiritual
mother
of
another
son
should
repeat
the
same
words
with
humble
obedience
and
immediately
adopt
as
her
children
all
the
children
of
god
the
brothers
of
jesus
christ
these
things
are
much
easier
to
feel
by
the
grace
of
god
than
to
be
expressed
in
words
i
remember
my
celestial
spouse
once
saying
to
me
is
imprinted
in
the
hearts
of
those
children
of
the
church
who
believe
hope
and
love

the
fear
felt
by
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
fourth
word
of
jesus
on
the
cross
it
was
about
one
when
i
was
taken
into
jerusalem
to
see
what
was
going
on
there
the
inhabitants
were
perfectly
overcome
with
terror
and
anxiety
the
streets
dark
and
gloomy
and
some
persons
were
feeling
their
way
about
while
others
seated
on
the
ground
with
their
heads
veiled
struck
their
breasts
or
went
up
to
the
roofs
of
their
houses
looked
at
the
sky
and
burst
forth
in
bitter
lamentations
even
the
animals
uttered
mournful
cries
and
hid
themselves
the
birds
flew
low
and
fell
to
the
ground
i
saw
pilate
conferring
with
herod
on
the
alarming
state
of
things
they
were
both
extremely
agitated
and
contemplated
the
appearance
of
the
sky
from
that
terrace
upon
which
herod
was
standing
when
he
delivered
up
jesus
to
be
insulted
by
the
infuriated
rabble
events
are
not
in
the
common
course
of
nature
they
both
exclaimed
must
be
caused
by
the
anger
of
the
gods
who
are
displeased
at
the
cruelty
which
has
been
exercised
towards
jesus
of
nazareth
pilate
and
herod
surrounded
by
guards
then
directed
their
hasty
trembling
steps
through
the
forum
to
herod
palace
pilate
turned
away
his
head
when
he
passed
gabbatha
from
whence
he
had
condemned
jesus
to
be
crucified
the
square
was
almost
empty
a
few
persons
might
be
seen
their
houses
as
quickly
as
possible
and
a
few
others
running
about
and
weeping
while
two
or
three
small
groups
might
be
distinguished
in
the
distance
pilate
sent
for
some
of
the
ancients
and
asked
them
what
they
thought
the
astounding
darkness
could
possible
portend
and
said
that
he
himself
considered
it
a
terrific
proof
of
the
anger
of
their
god
at
the
crucifixion
of
the
galilean
who
was
most
certainly
their
prophet
and
their
king
he
added
that
he
had
nothing
to
reproach
himself
with
on
that
head
for
he
had
washed
his
hands
of
the
whole
affair
and
was
therefore
quite
innocent
the
ancients
were
as
hardened
as
ever
and
replied
in
a
sullen
tone
that
there
was
nothing
unnatural
in
the
course
of
events
that
they
might
be
easily
accounted
for
by
philosophers
and
that
they
did
not
repent
of
anything
they
had
done
however
many
persons
were
converted
and
among
others
those
soldiers
who
fell
to
the
ground
at
the
words
of
our
lord
when
they
were
sent
to
arrest
him
in
the
garden
of
olives
the
rabble
assembled
before
pilate
house
and
instead
of
the
cry
of
him
crucify
him
which
had
resounded
in
the
morning
you
might
have
heard
vociferations
of
with
the
iniquitous
judge
the
blood
of
the
just
man
fall
upon
his
murderers
pilate
was
much
alarmed
he
sent
for
additional
guards
and
endeavoured
to
cast
all
the
blame
upon
the
jews
he
again
declared
that
the
crime
was
not
his
that
he
was
no
subject
of
this
jesus
whom
they
had
put
to
death
unjustly
and
who
was
their
king
their
prophet
their
holy
one
that
they
alone
were
guilty
as
it
must
be
evident
to
all
that
he
condemned
jesus
solely
from
compulsion
the
temple
was
thronged
with
jews
who
were
intent
on
the
immolation
of
the
paschal
lamb
but
when
the
darkness
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
the
countenance
of
one
from
that
of
the
other
they
were
seized
with
fear
horror
and
dread
which
they
expressed
by
mournful
cries
and
lamentations
the
high
priests
endeavoured
to
maintain
order
and
quiet
all
the
lamps
were
lighted
but
the
confusion
became
greater
every
moment
and
annas
appeared
perfectly
paralysed
with
terror
i
saw
him
endeavouring
to
hide
first
in
one
place
and
then
in
another
when
i
left
the
temple
and
walked
through
the
streets
i
remarked
that
although
not
a
breath
of
wind
was
stirring
yet
both
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
houses
were
shaking
as
if
in
a
storm
and
the
darkness
was
becoming
every
moment
more
dense
the
consternation
produced
by
the
sudden
darkness
at
mount
calvary
was
indescribable
when
it
first
commenced
the
confusion
of
the
noise
of
the
hammers
the
vociferations
of
the
rabble
the
cries
of
the
two
thieves
on
being
fastened
to
their
crosses
the
insulting
speeches
of
the
pharisees
the
evolutions
of
the
soldiers
and
the
drunken
shouts
of
the
executioners
had
so
completely
engrossed
the
attention
of
everyone
that
the
change
which
was
gradually
coming
over
the
face
of
nature
was
not
remarked
but
as
the
darkness
increased
every
sound
ceased
each
voice
was
hushed
and
remorse
and
terror
took
possession
of
every
heart
while
the
bystanders
retired
one
by
one
to
a
distance
from
the
cross
then
it
was
that
jesus
gave
his
mother
to
john
and
that
she
overcome
by
grief
was
carried
away
to
a
short
distance
as
the
darkness
continued
to
grow
more
and
more
dense
the
silence
became
perfectly
astounding
everyone
appeared
terror
struck
some
looked
at
the
sky
while
others
filled
with
remorse
turned
towards
the
cross
smote
their
breasts
and
were
converted
although
the
pharisees
were
in
reality
quite
as
much
alarmed
as
other
persons
yet
they
endeavoured
at
first
to
put
a
bold
face
on
the
matter
and
declared
that
they
could
see
nothing
unaccountable
in
these
events
but
at
last
even
they
lost
assurance
and
were
reduced
to
silence
the
disc
of
the
sun
was
of
a
tint
rather
resembling
a
mountain
when
viewed
by
moonlight
and
it
was
surrounded
by
a
bright
fiery
ring
the
stars
appeared
but
the
light
they
cast
was
red
and
lurid
the
birds
were
so
terrified
as
to
drop
to
the
ground
the
beasts
trembled
and
moaned
the
horses
and
the
asses
of
the
pharisees
crept
as
close
as
possible
to
one
another
and
put
their
heads
between
their
legs
the
thick
fog
penetrated
everything
stillness
reigned
around
the
cross
jesus
hung
upon
it
alone
forsaken
by
all
disciples
followers
friends
his
mother
even
was
removed
from
his
side
not
one
person
of
the
thousands
upon
whom
he
had
lavished
benefits
was
near
to
offer
him
the
slightest
alleviation
in
his
bitter
agony
his
soul
was
overspread
with
an
indescribable
feeling
of
bitterness
and
grief
all
within
him
was
dark
gloomy
and
wretched
the
darkness
which
reigned
around
was
but
symbolical
of
that
which
overspread
his
interior
he
turned
nevertheless
to
his
heavenly
father
he
prayed
for
his
enemies
he
offered
the
chalice
of
his
sufferings
for
their
redemption
he
continued
to
pray
as
he
had
done
during
the
whole
of
his
passion
and
repeated
portions
of
those
psalms
the
prophecies
of
which
were
then
receiving
their
accomplishment
in
him
i
saw
angels
standing
around
again
i
looked
at
jesus
my
beloved
spouse
on
his
cross
agonising
and
dying
yet
still
in
dreary
solitude
he
at
that
moment
endured
anguish
which
no
mortal
pen
can
describe
he
felt
that
suffering
which
would
overwhelm
a
poor
weak
mortal
if
deprived
at
once
of
all
consolation
both
divine
and
human
and
then
compelled
without
refreshment
assistance
or
light
to
traverse
the
stormy
desert
of
tribulation
upheld
by
faith
hope
and
charity
alone
his
sufferings
were
inexpressible
but
it
was
by
them
that
he
merited
for
us
the
grace
necessary
to
resist
those
temptations
to
despair
which
will
assail
us
at
the
hour
of
death
that
tremendous
hour
when
we
shall
feel
that
we
are
about
to
leave
all
that
is
dear
to
us
here
below
when
our
minds
weakened
by
disease
have
lost
the
power
of
reasoning
and
even
our
hopes
of
mercy
and
forgiveness
are
become
as
it
were
enveloped
in
mist
and
uncertainty
then
it
is
that
we
must
fly
to
jesus
unite
our
feelings
of
desolation
with
that
indescribable
dereliction
which
he
endured
upon
the
cross
and
be
certain
of
obtaining
a
glorious
victory
over
our
infernal
enemies
jesus
then
offered
to
his
eternal
father
his
poverty
his
dereliction
his
labours
and
above
all
the
bitter
sufferings
which
our
ingratitude
had
caused
him
to
endure
in
expiation
for
our
sins
and
weakness
no
one
therefore
who
is
united
to
jesus
in
the
bosom
of
his
church
must
despair
at
the
awful
moment
preceding
his
exit
from
this
life
even
if
he
be
deprived
of
all
sensible
light
and
comfort
for
he
must
then
remember
that
the
christian
is
no
longer
obliged
to
enter
this
dark
desert
alone
and
unprotected
as
jesus
has
cast
his
own
interior
and
exterior
dereliction
on
the
cross
into
this
gulf
of
desolation
consequently
he
will
not
be
left
to
cope
alone
with
death
or
be
suffered
to
leave
this
world
in
desolation
of
spirit
deprived
of
heavenly
consolation
all
fear
of
loneliness
and
despair
in
death
must
therefore
be
cast
away
for
jesus
who
is
our
true
light
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
has
preceded
us
on
that
dreary
road
has
overspread
it
with
blessings
and
raised
his
cross
upon
it
one
glance
at
which
will
calm
our
every
fear
jesus
then
if
we
may
so
express
ourselves
made
his
last
testament
in
the
presence
of
his
father
and
bequeathed
the
merits
of
his
death
and
passion
to
the
church
and
to
sinners
not
one
erring
soul
was
forgotten
he
thought
of
each
and
everyone
praying
likewise
even
for
those
heretics
who
have
endeavoured
to
prove
that
being
god
he
did
not
suffer
as
a
man
would
have
suffered
in
his
place
the
cry
which
he
allowed
to
pass
his
lips
in
the
height
of
his
agony
was
intended
not
only
to
show
the
excess
of
the
sufferings
he
was
then
enduring
but
likewise
to
encourage
all
afflicted
souls
who
acknowledge
god
as
their
father
to
lay
their
sorrows
with
filial
confidence
at
his
feet
it
was
towards
three
when
he
cried
out
in
a
loud
voice
eloi
lamma
sabacthani
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
these
words
of
our
lord
interrupted
the
dead
silence
which
had
continued
so
long
the
pharisees
turned
towards
him
and
one
of
them
said
he
calleth
elias
and
another
us
see
whether
elias
will
come
to
deliver
him
when
mary
heard
the
voice
of
her
divine
son
she
was
unable
to
restrain
herself
any
longer
but
rushed
forwards
and
returned
to
the
foot
of
the
cross
followed
by
john
mary
the
daughter
of
cleophas
mary
magdalen
and
salome
a
troop
of
about
thirty
horsemen
from
judea
and
the
environs
of
joppa
who
were
on
their
way
to
jerusalem
for
the
festival
passed
by
just
at
the
time
when
all
was
silent
round
the
cross
both
assistants
and
spectators
being
transfixed
with
terror
and
apprehensions
when
they
beheld
jesus
hanging
on
the
cross
saw
the
cruelty
with
which
he
had
been
treated
and
remarked
the
extraordinary
signs
of
god
wrath
which
overspread
the
face
of
nature
they
were
filled
with
horror
and
exclaimed
the
temple
of
god
were
not
in
jerusalem
the
city
should
be
burned
to
the
ground
for
having
taken
upon
itself
so
fearful
a
crime
these
words
from
the
lips
of
strangers
strangers
too
who
bore
the
appearance
of
persons
of
rank
made
a
great
impression
on
the
bystanders
and
loud
murmurs
and
exclamations
of
grief
were
heard
on
all
sides
some
individuals
gathered
together
in
groups
more
freely
to
indulge
their
sorrow
although
a
certain
portion
of
the
crowd
continued
to
blaspheme
and
revile
all
around
them
the
pharisees
were
compelled
to
assume
a
more
humble
tone
for
they
feared
great
existing
excitement
among
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
they
therefore
held
a
consultation
with
abenadar
the
centurion
and
agreed
with
him
that
the
gate
of
the
city
which
was
in
the
vicinity
should
be
closed
in
order
to
prevent
farther
communication
and
that
they
should
send
to
pilate
and
herod
for
men
to
guard
against
the
chance
of
an
insurrection
the
centurion
in
the
mean
time
doing
all
in
his
power
to
maintain
order
and
preventing
the
pharisees
from
insulting
jesus
lest
it
should
exasperate
the
people
still
more
shortly
after
three
the
light
reappeared
in
a
degree
the
moon
began
to
pass
away
from
the
disc
of
the
sun
while
the
sun
again
shone
forth
although
its
appearance
was
dim
being
surrounded
by
a
species
of
red
mist
by
degrees
it
became
more
bright
and
the
stars
vanished
but
the
sky
was
still
gloomy
the
enemies
of
jesus
soon
recovered
their
arrogant
spirit
when
they
saw
the
light
returning
and
it
was
then
that
they
exclaimed
he
calleth
elias
chapter
xlv
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
words
of
jesus
on
the
cross
his
death
the
light
continued
to
return
by
degrees
and
the
livid
exhausted
countenance
of
our
lord
again
became
visible
his
body
was
become
much
more
white
from
the
quantity
of
blood
he
had
lost
and
i
heard
him
exclaim
am
pressed
as
the
grape
which
is
trodden
in
the
winepress
my
blood
shall
be
poured
out
until
water
cometh
but
wine
shall
here
be
made
no
more
i
can
not
be
sure
whether
he
really
pronounced
these
words
so
as
to
be
heard
by
others
or
whether
they
were
only
an
answer
given
to
my
interior
prayer
i
afterwards
had
a
vision
relating
to
these
words
and
in
it
i
saw
japhet
making
wine
in
this
place
jesus
was
almost
fainting
his
tongue
was
parched
and
he
said
thirst
the
disciples
who
were
standing
round
the
cross
looked
at
him
with
the
deepest
expression
of
sorrow
and
he
added
you
not
have
given
me
a
little
water
by
these
words
he
gave
them
to
understand
that
no
one
would
have
prevented
them
from
doing
so
during
the
darkness
john
was
filled
with
remorse
and
replied
did
not
think
of
doing
so
o
lord
jesus
pronounced
a
few
more
words
the
import
of
which
was
friends
and
my
neighbours
were
also
to
forget
me
and
not
give
me
to
drink
that
so
what
was
written
concerning
me
might
be
fulfilled
this
omission
had
afflicted
him
very
much
the
disciples
then
offered
money
to
the
soldiers
to
obtain
permission
to
give
him
a
little
water
they
refused
to
give
it
but
dipped
a
sponge
in
vinegar
and
gall
and
were
about
to
offer
it
to
jesus
when
the
centurion
abenadar
whose
heart
was
touched
with
compassion
took
it
from
them
squeezed
out
the
gal
poured
some
fresh
vinegar
upon
it
and
fastening
it
to
a
reed
put
the
reed
at
the
end
of
a
lance
and
presented
it
for
jesus
to
drink
i
heard
our
lord
say
several
other
things
but
i
only
remember
these
words
my
voice
shall
be
silent
the
mouths
of
the
dead
shall
be
opened
some
of
the
bystanders
cried
out
blasphemeth
again
but
abenadar
compelled
them
to
be
silent
the
hour
of
our
lord
was
at
last
come
his
had
commenced
a
cold
sweat
overspread
every
limb
john
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
and
wiped
the
feet
of
jesus
with
his
scapular
magdalen
was
crouched
to
the
ground
in
a
perfect
frenzy
of
grief
behind
the
cross
the
blessed
virgin
stood
between
jesus
and
the
good
thief
supported
by
salome
and
mary
of
cleophas
with
her
eyes
rivetted
on
the
countenance
of
her
dying
son
jesus
then
said
is
consummated
and
raising
his
head
cried
out
in
a
loud
voice
into
thy
hands
i
commend
my
spirit
these
words
which
he
uttered
in
a
clear
and
thrilling
tone
resounded
through
heaven
and
earth
and
a
moment
after
he
bowed
down
his
head
and
gave
up
the
ghost
i
saw
his
soul
under
the
appearance
of
a
bright
meteor
penetrate
the
earth
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
john
and
the
holy
women
fell
prostrate
on
the
ground
the
centurion
abenadar
had
kept
his
eyes
steadfastly
fixed
on
the
disfigured
countenance
of
our
lord
and
was
perfectly
overwhelmed
by
all
that
had
taken
place
when
our
lord
pronounced
his
last
words
before
expiring
in
a
loud
tone
the
earth
trembled
and
the
rock
of
calvary
burst
asunder
forming
a
deep
chasm
between
the
cross
of
our
lord
and
that
of
gesmas
the
voice
of
god
that
solemn
and
terrible
voice
had
through
the
whole
universe
it
had
broken
the
solemn
silence
which
then
pervaded
all
nature
all
was
accomplished
the
soul
of
our
lord
had
left
his
body
his
last
cry
had
filled
every
breast
with
terror
the
convulsed
earth
had
paid
homage
to
its
creator
the
sword
of
grief
had
pierced
the
hearts
of
those
who
loved
him
this
moment
was
the
moment
of
grace
for
abenadar
his
horse
trembled
under
him
his
heart
was
touched
it
was
rent
like
the
hard
rock
he
threw
his
lance
to
a
distance
struck
his
breast
and
cried
out
be
the
most
high
god
the
god
of
abraham
of
isaac
and
of
jacob
indeed
this
man
was
the
son
of
god
his
words
convinced
many
among
the
soldiers
who
followed
his
example
and
were
likewise
converted
abenadar
became
from
this
moment
a
new
man
he
adored
the
true
god
and
would
no
longer
serve
his
enemies
he
gave
both
his
horse
and
his
lance
to
a
subaltern
of
the
name
of
longinus
who
having
addressed
a
few
words
to
the
soldiers
mounted
his
horse
and
took
the
command
upon
himself
abenadar
then
left
calvary
and
went
through
the
valley
of
gihon
to
the
caves
in
the
valley
of
hinnom
where
the
disciples
were
hidden
announced
the
death
of
our
lord
to
them
and
then
went
to
the
town
in
order
to
see
pilate
no
sooner
had
abenadar
rendered
public
testimony
of
his
belief
in
the
divinity
of
jesus
than
a
large
number
of
soldiers
followed
his
example
as
did
also
some
of
the
bystanders
and
even
a
few
pharisees
many
struck
their
breasts
wept
and
returned
home
while
others
rent
their
garments
and
cast
dust
on
their
heads
and
all
were
filled
with
horror
and
fear
john
arose
and
some
of
the
holy
women
who
were
at
a
short
distance
came
up
to
the
blessed
virgin
and
led
her
away
from
the
foot
of
the
cross
when
jesus
the
lord
of
life
and
death
gave
up
his
soul
into
the
hands
of
his
father
and
allowed
death
to
take
possession
of
his
body
this
sacred
body
trembled
and
turned
lividly
white
the
countless
wounds
which
were
covered
with
congealed
blood
appeared
like
dark
marks
his
cheeks
became
more
sunken
his
nose
more
pointed
and
his
eyes
which
were
obscured
with
blood
remained
but
half
open
he
raised
his
weary
head
which
was
still
crowned
with
thorns
for
a
moment
and
then
dropped
it
again
in
agony
of
pain
while
his
parched
and
torn
lips
only
partially
closed
showed
his
bloody
and
swollen
tongue
at
the
moment
of
death
his
hands
which
were
at
one
time
contracted
round
the
nails
opened
and
returned
to
their
natural
size
as
did
also
his
arms
his
body
became
stiff
and
the
whole
weight
was
thrown
upon
the
feet
his
knees
bent
and
his
feet
twisted
a
little
on
one
side
what
words
can
alas
express
the
deep
grief
of
the
blessed
virgin
her
eyes
closed
a
tint
overspread
her
countenance
unable
to
stand
she
fell
to
the
ground
but
was
soon
lifted
up
and
supported
by
john
magdalen
and
the
others
she
looked
once
more
upon
her
beloved
son
that
son
whom
she
had
conceived
by
the
holy
ghost
the
flesh
of
her
flesh
the
bone
of
her
bone
the
heart
of
her
heart
hanging
on
a
cross
between
two
thieves
crucified
dishonoured
contemned
by
those
whom
he
came
on
earth
to
save
and
well
might
she
at
this
moment
be
termed
queen
of
martyrs
the
sun
still
looked
dim
and
suffused
with
mist
and
during
the
time
of
the
earthquake
the
air
was
close
and
oppressive
but
by
degrees
it
became
more
clear
and
fresh
it
was
about
three
when
jesus
expired
the
pharisees
were
at
first
much
alarmed
at
the
earthquake
but
when
the
first
shock
was
over
they
recovered
themselves
began
to
throw
stones
into
the
chasm
and
tried
to
measure
its
depth
with
ropes
finding
however
that
they
could
not
fathom
its
bottom
they
became
thoughtful
listened
anxiously
to
the
groans
of
the
penitents
who
were
lamenting
and
striking
their
breasts
and
then
left
calvary
many
among
the
spectators
were
really
converted
and
the
greatest
part
returned
to
jerusalem
perfectly
overcome
with
fear
roman
soldiers
were
placed
at
the
gates
and
in
other
principal
parts
of
the
city
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
an
insurrection
cassius
remained
on
calvary
with
about
fifty
soldiers
the
friends
of
jesus
stood
round
the
cross
contemplated
our
lord
and
wept
many
among
the
holy
women
had
returned
to
their
homes
and
all
were
silent
and
overcome
with
grief
chapter
xlvi
the
earthquake
apparitions
of
the
dead
in
jerusalem
i
saw
the
soul
of
jesus
at
the
moment
he
expired
appear
under
the
form
of
a
bright
orb
and
accompanied
by
angels
among
whom
i
distinguished
the
angel
gabriel
penetrate
the
earth
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
i
likewise
saw
these
angels
cast
a
number
of
evil
spirits
into
the
great
abyss
and
i
heard
jesus
order
several
of
the
souls
in
limbo
to
the
bodies
in
which
they
once
dwelt
in
order
that
the
sight
might
fill
sinners
with
a
salutary
terror
and
that
these
souls
might
render
a
solemn
testimony
to
his
divinity
the
earthquake
which
produced
the
deep
chasm
at
calvary
did
much
damage
in
different
parts
of
palestine
but
ifs
effects
were
even
more
fatal
in
jerusalem
its
inhabitants
were
just
beginning
to
be
a
little
reassured
by
the
return
of
light
when
their
terror
was
reawakened
with
double
force
by
the
shocks
of
the
earthquake
and
the
terrible
noise
and
confusion
caused
by
the
downfall
of
houses
and
walls
on
all
sides
which
panic
was
still
farther
increased
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
dead
persons
confronting
the
trembling
miscreants
who
were
flying
to
hide
themselves
and
addressing
them
in
the
most
severe
and
reproachful
language
the
high
priests
had
recommenced
the
sacrifice
of
the
paschal
lamb
which
had
been
stopped
by
the
unexpected
darkness
and
they
were
triumphing
at
the
return
of
light
when
suddenly
the
ground
beneath
them
trembled
the
neighbouring
buildings
fell
down
and
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
in
two
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
excess
of
terror
at
first
rendered
those
on
the
outside
speechless
but
after
a
time
they
burst
forth
into
cries
and
lamentations
the
confusion
in
the
interior
of
the
temple
was
not
however
as
great
as
would
naturally
have
been
expected
because
the
strictest
order
and
decorum
were
always
enforced
there
particularly
with
regard
to
the
regulation
to
be
followed
by
those
who
entered
to
make
their
sacrifice
and
those
who
left
after
having
offered
it
the
crowd
was
great
but
the
ceremonies
were
so
solemnly
carried
out
by
the
priests
that
they
totally
engrossed
the
minds
of
the
assistants
first
came
the
immolation
of
the
lamb
then
the
sprinkling
of
its
blood
accompanied
by
the
chanting
of
canticles
and
the
sounding
of
trumpets
the
priests
were
endeavouring
to
continue
the
sacrifices
when
suddenly
an
unexpected
and
most
appalling
pause
ensued
terror
and
astonishment
were
depicted
on
each
countenance
all
was
thrown
into
confusion
not
a
sound
was
heard
the
sacrifices
ceased
there
was
a
general
rush
to
the
gates
of
the
temple
everyone
endeavoured
to
fly
as
quickly
as
possible
and
well
might
they
fly
well
might
they
fear
and
tremble
for
in
the
midst
of
the
multitude
there
suddenly
appeared
persons
who
had
been
dead
and
buried
for
many
years
these
persons
looked
at
them
sternly
and
reproved
them
most
severely
for
the
crime
they
had
committed
that
day
in
bringing
about
the
death
of
just
man
and
calling
down
his
blood
upon
their
heads
even
in
the
midst
of
this
confusion
some
attempts
were
however
made
by
the
priests
to
preserve
order
they
prevented
those
who
were
in
the
inner
part
of
the
temple
from
rushing
forward
pushing
their
way
through
the
crowds
who
were
in
advance
of
them
and
descending
the
steps
which
led
out
of
the
temple
they
even
continued
the
sacrifices
in
some
parts
and
endeavoured
to
calm
the
fears
of
the
people
the
appearance
of
the
temple
at
this
moment
can
only
be
described
by
comparing
it
to
an
on
which
persons
have
thrown
stones
or
which
has
been
disturbed
by
a
sick
being
driven
into
its
centre
the
ants
in
those
parts
on
which
the
stones
have
fallen
or
which
the
stick
had
disturbed
are
filled
with
confusion
and
terror
they
run
to
and
fro
and
do
nothing
while
the
ants
in
those
parts
which
have
not
been
disturbed
continue
to
labour
quietly
and
even
begin
to
repair
the
damaged
parts
the
high
priest
caiphas
and
his
retinue
did
not
lose
their
presence
of
mind
and
by
the
outward
tranquillity
which
their
diabolical
hardness
of
heart
enabled
them
to
preserve
they
calmed
the
confusion
in
a
great
degree
and
then
did
their
utmost
to
prevent
the
people
from
looking
upon
these
stupendous
events
as
testimonies
of
the
innocence
of
jesus
the
roman
garrison
belonging
to
the
fortress
of
antonia
likewise
made
great
efforts
to
maintain
order
consequently
the
disturbance
of
the
festival
was
not
followed
by
an
insurrection
although
every
heart
was
fixed
with
fear
and
anxiety
which
anxiety
the
pharisees
endeavoured
and
in
some
instances
with
success
to
calm
i
remember
a
few
other
striking
incidents
in
the
first
place
the
two
columns
which
were
placed
at
the
entrance
of
their
holy
of
holies
and
to
which
a
magnificent
curtain
was
appended
were
shaken
to
the
very
foundations
the
column
on
the
left
side
fell
down
in
a
southerly
and
that
on
the
right
side
in
a
northerly
direction
thus
rending
the
veil
in
two
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
with
a
fearful
sound
and
exposing
the
holy
of
holies
uncovered
to
the
public
gaze
a
large
stone
was
loosened
and
fell
from
the
wall
at
the
entrance
of
the
sanctuary
near
where
the
aged
simeon
used
to
kneel
and
the
arch
was
broken
the
ground
was
heaved
up
and
many
other
columns
were
thrown
down
in
other
parts
of
the
temple
an
apparition
of
the
high
priest
zacharias
who
was
slain
between
the
porch
and
the
altar
was
seen
in
the
sanctuary
he
uttered
fearful
menaces
spoke
of
the
death
of
the
second
zacharias
and
of
that
of
john
baptist
as
also
of
the
violent
deaths
of
the
other
the
two
sons
of
the
high
priest
simon
surnamed
the
just
ancestors
of
the
aged
simeon
who
prophesied
when
jesus
was
presented
in
the
temple
made
their
appearance
in
the
part
usually
occupied
by
the
doctors
of
the
law
they
also
spoke
in
terrific
terms
of
the
deaths
of
the
prophets
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
old
law
which
was
now
about
to
cease
and
they
exhorted
all
present
to
be
converted
and
to
embrace
the
doctrines
which
had
been
preached
by
him
whom
they
had
crucified
the
prophet
jeremiah
likewise
appeared
he
stood
near
the
altar
and
proclaimed
in
a
menacing
tone
that
the
ancient
sacrifice
was
at
an
end
and
that
a
new
one
had
commenced
as
these
apparitions
took
place
in
parts
where
none
but
priests
were
allowed
to
enter
caiphas
and
a
few
others
were
alone
cognisant
of
them
and
they
endeavoured
as
far
as
possible
either
to
deny
their
reality
or
to
conceal
them
these
prodigies
were
followed
by
others
still
more
extraordinary
the
doors
of
the
sanctuary
flew
open
of
themselves
and
a
voice
was
heard
to
utter
these
words
us
leave
this
place
and
i
saw
all
the
angels
of
the
lord
instantly
leave
the
temple
the
pharisees
who
went
to
calvary
a
short
time
before
our
lord
expired
were
almost
all
converted
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
they
returned
to
the
temple
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
and
were
perfectly
thunderstruck
at
all
which
had
taken
place
there
they
spoke
most
sternly
both
to
annas
and
to
caiphas
and
left
the
temple
annas
had
always
been
the
most
bitter
of
the
enemies
of
jesus
and
had
headed
every
proceeding
against
him
but
the
supernatural
events
which
had
taken
place
had
completely
unnerved
him
that
he
knew
not
where
to
hide
himself
caiphas
was
in
realty
excessively
alarmed
and
filled
with
anxiety
but
his
pride
was
so
great
that
he
concealed
his
feelings
as
far
as
possible
and
endeavoured
to
reassure
annas
he
succeeded
for
a
time
but
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
person
who
had
been
dead
many
years
marred
the
effect
of
his
words
and
annas
became
again
a
prey
to
the
most
fearful
terror
and
remorse
whilst
these
things
were
going
on
in
the
temple
the
confusion
and
panic
were
not
less
in
jerusalem
dead
persons
were
walking
about
and
many
walls
and
buildings
had
been
shaken
by
the
earthquake
and
parts
of
them
fallen
down
the
superstition
of
pilate
rendered
him
even
more
accessible
to
fear
he
was
perfectly
paralysed
and
speechless
with
terror
his
palace
was
shaken
to
the
very
foundation
and
the
earth
quaked
beneath
his
feet
he
ran
wildly
from
room
to
room
and
the
dead
constantly
stood
before
him
reproaching
him
with
the
unjust
sentence
he
had
passed
upon
jesus
he
thought
that
they
were
the
gods
of
the
galilean
and
took
refuge
in
an
inner
room
where
he
offered
incense
and
made
vows
to
his
idols
to
invoke
their
assistance
in
his
distress
herod
was
usually
alarmed
but
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
palace
out
of
the
sight
of
everyone
more
than
a
hundred
persons
who
had
died
at
different
epochs
the
bodies
they
had
occupied
when
on
earth
made
their
appearance
in
different
parts
of
jerusalem
and
filled
the
inhabitants
with
inexpressible
consternation
those
souls
which
had
been
released
by
jesus
from
limbo
uncovered
their
faces
and
wandered
to
and
fro
in
the
streets
and
although
their
bodies
were
the
same
as
those
which
they
had
animated
when
on
earth
yet
these
bodies
did
not
appear
to
touch
the
ground
as
they
walked
they
entered
the
houses
of
their
descendants
proclaimed
the
innocence
of
jesus
and
reproved
those
who
had
taken
part
in
his
death
most
severely
i
saw
them
passing
through
the
principal
streets
they
were
generally
in
couples
and
appeared
to
me
to
glide
through
the
airs
without
moving
their
feet
the
countenances
of
some
were
pale
others
of
a
yellow
tint
their
beards
were
long
and
their
voices
sounded
strange
and
sepulchral
their
were
such
as
it
was
customary
to
use
at
the
period
of
their
decease
when
they
reached
the
place
where
sentence
of
death
was
proclaimed
on
jesus
before
the
procession
started
for
calvary
they
paused
for
a
moment
and
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
be
to
jesus
for
ever
and
ever
and
destruction
to
his
enemies
towards
four
all
the
dead
returned
to
their
graves
the
sacrifices
in
the
temple
had
been
so
interrupted
and
the
confusion
caused
by
the
different
prodigies
was
so
great
that
very
few
persons
ate
the
paschal
lamb
on
that
evening
chapter
xlvii
the
request
of
joseph
of
arimathea
to
be
allowed
to
have
the
body
of
jesus
scarcely
had
the
commotion
which
the
town
had
been
thrown
into
begun
to
subside
in
a
degree
when
the
jews
belonging
to
the
council
sent
to
pilate
to
request
that
the
legs
of
the
criminals
might
be
broken
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
their
lives
before
the
dawned
pilate
immediately
dispatched
executioners
to
calvary
to
carry
out
their
wishes
joseph
of
arimathea
then
demanded
an
audience
he
had
heard
of
the
death
of
jesus
and
he
and
nicodemus
had
determined
to
bury
him
in
a
new
sepulchre
which
he
had
made
at
the
end
of
his
garden
not
far
from
calvary
pilate
was
still
filled
with
anxiety
and
solicitude
and
was
much
astonished
at
seeing
a
person
holding
a
high
position
like
joseph
so
anxious
for
leave
to
give
honourable
burial
to
a
criminal
whom
he
had
sentenced
to
be
ignominiously
crucified
he
sent
for
the
centurion
abenadar
who
returned
to
jerusalem
after
he
had
conferred
with
the
disciples
who
were
hidden
in
the
caverns
and
asked
him
whether
the
king
of
the
jews
was
really
dead
abenadar
gave
pilate
a
full
account
of
the
death
of
our
lord
of
his
last
words
and
of
the
loud
cry
he
uttered
immediately
before
death
and
of
the
earthquake
which
had
rent
the
great
chasm
in
the
rock
the
only
thing
at
which
pilate
expressed
surprise
was
that
the
death
of
jesus
should
have
taken
place
so
quickly
as
those
who
were
crucified
usually
lived
much
longer
but
although
he
said
so
little
every
word
uttered
by
joseph
increased
his
dismay
and
remorse
he
instantly
gave
joseph
an
order
by
which
he
was
authorised
to
take
down
the
body
of
the
king
of
the
jews
from
the
cross
and
to
perform
the
rites
of
sepulture
at
once
pilate
appeared
to
endeavour
by
his
readiness
in
granting
this
request
to
wish
to
make
up
in
a
degree
for
his
previous
cruel
and
unjust
conduct
and
he
was
likewise
very
glad
to
do
what
he
was
certain
would
annoy
the
priests
extremely
as
he
knew
their
wish
was
to
have
jesus
buried
ignominiously
between
the
two
thieves
he
dispatched
a
messenger
to
calvary
to
see
his
orders
executed
i
believe
the
messenger
was
abenadar
for
i
saw
him
assisting
in
taking
jesus
down
from
the
cross
when
joseph
of
arimathea
left
pilate
palace
he
instantly
rejoined
nicodemus
who
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
house
of
a
pious
woman
which
stood
opposite
to
a
large
street
and
was
not
far
from
that
alley
where
jesus
was
so
shamefully
when
he
first
commenced
carrying
his
cross
the
woman
was
a
vendor
of
aromatic
herbs
and
nicodemus
had
purchased
many
perfumes
which
were
necessary
for
embalming
the
body
of
jesus
from
her
she
procured
the
more
precious
kinds
from
other
places
and
joseph
went
away
to
procure
a
fine
his
servants
then
fetched
ladders
hammers
pegs
jars
of
water
and
sponges
from
a
neighbouring
shed
and
placed
them
in
a
similar
to
that
on
which
the
disciples
of
john
the
baptist
put
his
body
when
they
carried
it
off
from
the
castle
of
macherus
chapter
xlviii
the
opening
of
the
side
of
jesus
death
of
the
two
thieves
whilst
these
events
were
taking
place
in
jerusalem
silence
reigned
around
calvary
the
crowd
which
had
been
for
a
time
so
noisy
and
tumultuous
was
dispersed
all
were
panicstricken
in
some
that
panic
had
produced
sincere
repentance
but
on
others
it
had
had
no
beneficial
effects
mary
john
magdalen
mary
of
cleophas
and
salome
had
remained
either
standing
or
sitting
before
the
cross
closely
veiled
and
weeping
silently
a
few
soldiers
were
leaning
over
the
terrace
which
enclosed
the
platform
cassius
rode
up
and
down
the
sky
was
lowering
and
all
nature
wore
a
garb
of
mourning
six
archers
soon
after
made
their
appearance
bringing
with
them
ladders
spades
ropes
and
large
iron
staves
for
the
purpose
of
breaking
the
legs
of
the
criminals
in
order
to
hasten
their
deaths
when
they
approached
our
lord
cross
his
friends
retired
a
few
paces
back
and
the
blessed
virgin
was
seized
with
fear
lest
they
should
indulge
their
hatred
of
jesus
by
insulting
even
his
dead
body
her
fears
were
not
quite
unfounded
for
when
they
first
placed
their
ladders
against
the
cross
they
declared
that
he
was
only
pretending
to
be
dead
in
a
few
moments
however
seeing
that
he
was
cold
and
stiff
they
left
him
and
removed
their
ladders
to
the
crosses
on
which
the
two
thieves
were
still
hanging
alive
they
took
up
their
iron
staves
and
broke
the
arms
of
the
thieves
above
and
below
the
elbow
while
another
archer
at
the
same
moment
broke
their
legs
both
above
and
below
the
knee
gesmas
uttered
frightful
cries
therefore
the
executioner
finished
him
off
by
three
heavy
blows
of
a
cudgel
on
his
chest
dismas
gave
a
deep
groan
and
expired
he
was
the
first
among
mortals
who
had
the
happiness
of
rejoining
his
redeemer
the
cords
were
then
loosened
the
two
bodies
fell
to
the
ground
and
the
executioners
dragged
them
to
a
deep
morass
which
was
between
calvary
and
the
walls
of
the
town
and
buried
them
there
the
archers
still
appeared
doubtful
whether
jesus
was
really
dead
and
the
brutality
they
had
shown
in
breaking
the
legs
of
the
thieves
made
the
holy
women
tremble
as
to
what
outrage
they
might
next
perpetrate
on
the
body
of
our
lord
but
cassius
the
subaltern
officer
a
young
man
of
about
whose
weak
squinting
eyes
and
nervous
manner
had
often
excited
the
derision
of
his
companions
was
suddenly
illuminated
by
grace
and
being
quite
overcome
at
the
sight
of
the
cruel
conduct
of
the
soldiers
and
the
deep
sorrow
of
the
holy
women
determined
to
relieve
their
anxiety
by
proving
beyond
dispute
that
jesus
was
really
dead
the
kindness
of
his
heart
prompted
him
but
unconsciously
to
himself
he
fulfilled
a
prophecy
he
seized
his
lance
and
rode
quickly
up
to
the
mound
on
which
the
cross
was
planted
stopped
just
between
the
cross
of
the
good
thief
and
that
of
our
lord
and
taking
his
lance
in
both
hands
thrust
it
so
completely
into
the
right
side
of
jesus
that
the
point
went
through
the
heart
and
appeared
on
the
left
side
when
cassius
drew
his
lance
out
of
the
wound
a
quantity
of
blood
and
water
rushed
from
it
and
flowed
over
his
face
and
body
this
species
of
washing
produced
effects
somewhat
similar
to
the
vivifying
waters
of
baptism
grace
and
salvation
at
once
entered
his
soul
he
leaped
from
his
horse
threw
himself
upon
his
knees
struck
his
breast
and
confessed
loudly
before
all
his
firm
belief
in
the
divinity
of
jesus
the
blessed
virgin
and
her
companions
were
still
standing
near
with
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
cross
but
when
cassius
thrust
his
lance
into
the
side
of
jesus
they
were
much
startled
and
rushed
with
one
accord
up
to
it
mary
looked
as
if
the
lance
had
transfixed
her
heart
instead
of
that
of
her
divine
son
and
could
scarcely
support
herself
cassius
meantime
remained
kneeling
and
thanking
god
not
only
for
the
grace
he
had
received
but
likewise
for
the
cure
of
the
complaint
in
his
eyes
which
had
caused
the
weakness
and
the
squint
this
cure
had
been
effected
at
the
same
moment
that
the
darkness
with
which
his
soul
was
previously
filled
was
removed
every
heart
was
overcome
at
the
sight
of
the
blood
of
our
lord
which
ran
into
a
hollow
in
the
rock
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
mary
john
the
holy
women
and
cassius
gathered
up
the
blood
and
water
in
flasks
and
wiped
up
the
remainder
with
pieces
of
cassius
whose
sight
was
perfectly
restored
at
the
same
moment
that
the
eyes
of
his
soul
were
opened
was
deeply
moved
and
continued
his
humble
prayer
of
thanksgiving
the
soldiers
were
truck
with
astonishment
at
the
miracle
which
had
taken
place
and
cast
themselves
on
their
knees
by
his
side
at
the
same
time
striking
their
breasts
and
confessing
jesus
the
water
and
blood
continued
to
flow
from
the
large
wound
in
the
side
of
our
lord
it
ran
into
the
hollow
in
the
rock
and
the
holy
women
put
it
in
vases
while
mary
and
magdalen
mingled
their
tears
the
archers
who
had
received
a
message
from
pilate
ordering
them
not
to
touch
the
body
of
jesus
did
not
return
at
all
all
these
events
took
place
near
the
cross
at
a
little
before
four
during
the
time
that
joseph
of
arimathea
and
nicodemus
were
gathering
together
the
articles
necessary
for
the
burial
of
jesus
but
the
servants
of
joseph
having
been
sent
to
clean
out
the
tomb
informed
the
friends
of
our
lord
that
their
master
intended
to
take
the
body
of
jesus
and
place
it
in
his
new
sepulchre
john
immediately
returned
to
the
town
with
the
holy
women
in
the
first
place
that
mary
might
recruit
her
strength
a
little
and
in
the
second
to
purchase
a
few
things
which
would
be
required
for
the
burial
the
blessed
virgin
had
a
small
lodging
among
the
buildings
near
the
cenaculum
they
did
not
the
town
through
the
gate
which
was
the
nearest
to
calvary
because
it
was
closed
and
guarded
by
soldiers
placed
there
by
the
pharisees
but
they
went
through
that
gate
which
leads
to
bethlehem

this
chapter
will
contain
some
descriptions
of
places
given
by
sister
emmerich
on
various
occasions
they
will
be
followed
by
a
description
of
the
tomb
and
garden
of
joseph
of
arimathea
that
so
we
may
have
no
need
to
interrupt
the
account
of
the
burial
of
our
lord
the
first
gate
which
stood
on
the
eastern
side
of
jerusalem
to
the
south
of
the
angle
of
the
temple
was
the
one
leading
to
the
suburb
of
ophel
the
gate
of
the
sheep
was
to
the
north
of
the
angle
of
the
temple
between
these
two
gates
there
was
a
third
leading
to
some
streets
situated
to
the
east
of
the
temple
and
inhabited
for
the
most
part
by
stonemasons
and
other
workmen
the
houses
in
these
streets
were
supported
by
the
foundations
of
the
temple
and
almost
all
belonged
to
nicodemus
who
had
caused
them
to
be
built
and
who
employed
nearly
all
the
workmen
living
there
nicodemus
had
not
long
before
built
a
beautiful
gate
as
an
entrance
to
these
streets
called
the
gate
of
moriah
it
was
but
just
finished
and
through
it
jesus
had
entered
the
town
on
palm
sunday
thus
he
entered
by
the
new
gate
of
nicodemus
through
which
no
one
had
yet
passed
and
was
buried
in
the
new
monument
of
joseph
of
arimathea
in
which
no
one
had
yet
been
laid
this
gate
was
afterwards
walled
up
and
there
was
a
tradition
that
the
christians
were
once
again
to
enter
the
town
through
it
even
in
the
present
day
a
gate
called
by
the
turks
the
golden
gate
stands
on
this
spot
the
road
leading
to
the
west
from
the
gate
of
the
sheep
passed
almost
exactly
between
the
side
of
mount
sion
and
calvary
from
this
gate
to
golgotha
the
distance
was
about
two
miles
and
a
quarter
and
from
pilate
palace
to
golgotha
about
two
miles
the
fortress
antonia
was
situated
to
the
of
the
mountain
of
the
temple
on
a
detached
rock
a
person
going
towards
the
west
on
leaving
pilate
palace
would
have
had
this
fortress
to
his
left
on
one
of
its
walls
there
was
a
platform
commanding
the
forum
and
from
which
pilate
was
accustomed
to
make
proclamations
to
the
people
he
did
this
for
instance
when
he
promulgated
new
laws
when
our
divine
lord
was
carrying
his
cross
in
the
interior
of
the
town
mount
calvary
was
frequently
on
his
right
hand
this
road
which
partly
ran
in
a
direction
led
to
a
gate
made
in
an
inner
wall
of
the
town
towards
sion
beyond
this
wall
to
the
left
there
was
a
sort
of
suburb
containing
more
gardens
than
houses
and
towards
the
outer
wall
of
the
city
stood
some
magnificent
sepulchres
with
stone
entrances
on
this
side
was
a
house
belonging
to
lazarus
with
beautiful
gardens
extending
towards
that
part
where
the
outer
western
wall
of
jerusalem
turned
to
the
south
i
believe
that
a
little
private
door
made
in
the
city
wall
and
through
which
jesus
and
his
disciples
often
passed
by
permission
of
lazarus
led
to
these
gardens
the
gate
standing
at
the
angle
of
the
town
led
to
bethsur
which
was
situated
more
towards
the
north
than
emmaus
and
joppa
the
western
part
of
jerusalem
was
lower
than
any
other
the
land
on
which
it
was
built
first
sloped
in
the
direction
of
the
surrounding
wall
and
then
rose
again
when
close
to
it
and
on
this
declivity
there
stood
gardens
and
vineyards
behind
which
wound
a
wide
road
with
paths
leading
to
the
walls
and
towers
on
the
other
side
without
the
wall
the
land
descended
towards
the
valley
so
that
the
walls
surrounding
the
lower
part
of
the
town
looked
as
if
built
on
a
raised
terrace
there
are
gardens
and
vineyards
even
in
the
present
day
on
the
outer
hill
when
jesus
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
way
of
the
cross
he
had
on
his
left
hand
that
part
of
the
town
where
there
were
so
many
gardens
and
it
was
from
thence
that
simon
of
cyrene
was
coming
when
he
met
the
procession
the
gate
by
which
jesus
left
the
town
was
not
entirely
facing
the
west
but
rather
the
the
city
wall
on
the
side
after
passing
through
the
gate
ran
somewhat
in
a
southerly
direction
then
turned
towards
the
west
and
then
again
to
the
south
round
mount
sion
on
this
side
there
stood
a
large
tower
like
a
fortress
the
gate
by
which
jesus
left
the
town
was
at
no
great
distance
from
another
gate
more
towards
the
south
leading
down
to
the
valley
and
where
a
road
turning
to
the
left
in
the
direction
of
bethlehem
commenced
the
road
turned
to
the
north
towards
mount
calvary
shortly
after
that
gate
by
which
jesus
left
jerusalem
when
bearing
his
cross
mount
calvary
was
very
steep
on
its
eastern
side
facing
the
town
and
a
gradual
descent
on
the
western
and
on
this
side
from
which
the
road
to
emmaus
was
to
be
seen
there
was
a
field
in
which
i
saw
luke
gather
several
plants
when
he
and
cleophas
were
going
to
emmaus
and
met
jesus
on
the
way
near
the
walls
to
the
east
and
south
of
calvary
there
were
also
gardens
sepulchres
and
vineyards
the
cross
was
buried
on
the
side
at
the
foot
of
mount
calvary
the
garden
of
joseph
of
arimathea
was
situated
near
the
gate
of
bethlehem
at
about
a
seven
minutes
walk
from
calvary
it
was
a
very
fine
garden
with
tall
trees
banks
and
thickets
in
it
which
gave
much
shade
and
was
situated
on
a
rising
ground
extending
to
the
walls
of
the
a
person
coming
from
the
northern
side
of
the
valley
and
entering
the
garden
had
on
his
left
hand
a
slight
ascent
extending
as
far
as
the
city
wall
and
on
his
right
at
the
end
of
the
garden
a
detached
rock
where
the
cave
of
the
sepulchre
was
situated
the
grotto
in
which
it
was
made
looked
to
the
east
and
on
the
and
sides
of
the
same
rock
were
two
other
smaller
sepulchres
which
were
also
new
and
with
depressed
fronts
a
pathway
beginning
on
the
western
side
of
this
rock
ran
all
round
it
the
ground
in
front
of
the
sepulchre
was
higher
than
that
of
the
entrance
and
a
person
wishing
to
enter
the
cavern
had
to
descend
several
steps
the
cave
was
sufficiently
large
for
four
men
to
be
able
to
stand
close
up
to
the
wall
on
either
side
without
impeding
the
movements
of
the
bearers
of
the
body
opposite
the
door
was
a
cavity
in
the
rock
in
which
the
tomb
was
made
it
was
about
two
feet
above
the
level
of
the
ground
and
fastened
to
the
rock
by
one
side
only
like
an
altar
two
persons
could
stand
one
at
the
head
and
one
at
the
foot
and
there
was
a
place
also
for
a
third
in
front
even
if
the
door
of
the
cavity
was
closed
this
door
was
made
of
some
metal
perhaps
of
brass
and
had
two
folding
doors
these
doors
could
be
closed
by
a
stone
being
rolled
against
them
and
the
stone
used
for
this
purpose
was
kept
outside
the
cavern
immediately
after
our
lord
was
placed
in
the
sepulchre
it
was
rolled
in
front
of
the
door
it
was
very
large
and
could
not
be
removed
without
the
united
effort
of
several
men
opposite
the
entrance
of
the
cavern
there
stood
a
stone
bench
and
by
mounting
on
this
a
person
could
climb
on
to
the
rock
which
was
covered
with
grass
and
from
whence
the
city
walls
the
highest
parts
of
mount
sion
and
some
towers
could
be
seen
as
well
as
the
gate
of
bethlehem
and
the
fountain
of
gihon
the
rock
inside
was
of
a
white
colour
intersected
with
red
and
blue
veins
chapter
the
descent
from
the
cross
at
the
time
when
everyone
had
left
the
neighbourhood
of
the
cross
and
a
few
guards
alone
stood
around
it
i
saw
five
persons
who
i
think
were
disciples
and
who
had
come
by
the
valley
from
bethania
draw
nigh
to
calvary
gaze
for
a
few
moments
upon
the
cross
and
then
steal
away
three
times
i
met
in
the
vicinity
two
men
who
were
making
examinations
and
anxiously
consulting
together
these
men
were
joseph
of
arimathea
and
nicodemus
the
first
time
was
during
the
crucifixion
perhaps
when
they
caused
the
clothes
of
jesus
to
be
brought
back
from
the
soldiers
and
they
were
then
at
no
great
distance
from
calvary
the
second
was
when
after
standing
to
look
whether
the
crowd
was
dispersing
they
went
to
the
town
to
make
some
preparations
the
third
was
on
their
return
from
the
tomb
to
the
cross
when
they
were
looking
around
in
every
direction
as
if
waiting
for
a
favourable
moment
and
then
concerted
together
as
to
the
manner
in
which
they
should
take
the
body
of
our
lord
down
from
the
cross
after
which
they
returned
to
the
town
their
next
care
was
to
make
arrangements
for
carrying
with
them
the
necessary
articles
for
embalming
the
body
and
their
servants
took
some
tools
with
which
to
detach
it
from
the
cross
as
well
as
two
ladders
which
they
found
in
a
barn
close
to
nicodemus
house
each
of
these
ladders
consisted
of
a
single
pole
crossed
at
regular
intervals
by
pieces
of
wood
which
formed
the
steps
there
were
hooks
which
could
be
fastened
on
any
part
of
the
pole
and
by
means
of
which
the
ladder
could
be
steadied
or
on
which
perhaps
anything
required
for
the
work
could
also
be
hung
the
woman
from
whom
they
had
bought
their
spices
had
packed
the
whole
neatly
together
nicodemus
had
bought
a
hundred
pounds
weight
of
roots
which
quantity
is
equal
to
about
pounds
of
our
measure
as
has
been
explained
to
me
they
carried
these
spices
in
little
barrels
make
of
bark
which
were
hung
round
their
necks
and
rested
on
their
breasts
one
of
these
barrels
contained
some
sort
of
powder
they
had
also
some
bundles
of
herbs
in
bags
made
of
parchment
or
leather
and
joseph
carried
a
box
of
ointment
but
i
do
not
know
what
this
box
was
made
of
the
servants
were
to
carry
vases
leathern
bottles
sponges
and
tools
on
a
species
of
litter
and
they
likewise
took
fire
with
them
in
a
closed
lantern
they
left
the
town
before
their
master
and
by
a
different
gate
perhaps
that
of
bethania
and
then
turned
their
steps
towards
mount
calvary
as
they
walked
through
the
town
they
passed
by
the
house
where
the
blessed
virgin
john
and
the
holy
women
had
gone
to
seek
different
things
required
for
embalming
the
body
of
jesus
and
john
and
the
holy
women
followed
the
servants
at
a
certain
distance
the
women
were
about
five
in
number
and
some
of
them
carried
large
bundles
of
linen
under
their
mantles
it
was
the
custom
for
women
when
they
went
out
in
the
evening
or
if
intending
to
perform
some
work
of
piety
secretly
to
wrap
their
persons
carefully
in
a
long
sheet
at
least
a
yard
wide
they
began
by
one
arm
and
then
wound
the
linen
so
closely
round
their
body
that
they
could
not
walk
without
difficulty
i
have
seen
them
wrapped
up
in
this
manner
and
the
sheet
not
only
extended
to
both
arms
but
likewise
veiled
the
head
on
the
present
occasion
the
appearance
of
this
dress
was
most
striking
in
my
eyes
for
it
was
a
real
mourning
garment
joseph
and
nicodemus
were
also
in
mourning
attire
and
wore
black
sleeves
and
wide
sashes
their
cloaks
which
they
had
drawn
over
their
heads
were
both
wide
and
long
of
a
common
grey
colour
and
served
to
conceal
everything
that
they
were
carrying
they
turned
their
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
gate
leading
to
mount
calvary
the
streets
were
deserted
and
quiet
for
terror
kept
everyone
at
home
the
greatest
number
were
beginning
to
repent
and
but
few
were
keeping
the
festival
when
joseph
and
nicodemus
reached
the
gate
they
found
it
closed
and
the
road
streets
and
every
corner
lined
with
soldiers
these
were
the
soldiers
whom
the
pharisees
had
asked
for
at
about
two
and
whom
they
had
kept
under
arms
and
on
guard
as
they
still
feared
a
tumult
among
the
people
joseph
showed
an
order
signed
by
pilate
to
let
them
pass
freely
and
the
soldiers
were
most
willing
that
they
should
do
so
but
explained
to
him
that
they
had
endeavoured
several
times
to
open
the
gate
without
being
able
to
move
it
that
apparently
the
gate
had
received
a
shock
and
been
strained
in
some
part
and
that
on
this
account
the
archers
sent
to
break
the
legs
of
the
thieves
had
been
obliged
to
return
to
the
city
by
another
gate
but
when
joseph
and
nicodemus
seized
hold
of
the
bolt
the
gate
opened
as
if
of
itself
to
the
great
astonishment
of
all
the
bystanders
it
was
still
dark
and
the
sky
cloudy
when
they
reached
mount
calvary
where
they
found
the
servants
who
had
been
sent
on
already
arrived
and
the
holy
women
sitting
weeping
in
front
of
the
cross
cassius
and
several
soldiers
who
were
converted
remained
at
a
certain
distance
and
their
demeanour
was
respectful
and
reserved
joseph
and
nicodemus
described
to
the
blessed
virgin
and
john
all
they
had
done
to
save
jesus
from
an
ignominious
death
and
learned
from
them
how
they
had
succeeded
in
preventing
the
bones
of
our
lord
from
being
broken
and
how
the
prophecy
had
been
fulfilled
they
spoke
also
of
the
wound
which
cassius
had
made
with
his
lance
no
sooner
was
the
centurion
abenadar
arrived
than
they
began
with
the
deepest
recollection
of
spirit
their
mournful
and
sacred
labour
of
taking
down
from
the
cross
and
embalming
the
adorable
body
of
our
lord
the
blessed
virgin
and
magdalen
were
seated
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
while
on
the
side
between
the
cross
of
dismas
and
that
of
jesus
the
other
women
were
engaged
in
preparing
the
linen
spices
water
sponges
and
vases
cassius
also
came
forward
and
related
to
abenadar
the
miraculous
cure
of
his
eyes
all
were
deeply
affected
and
their
hearts
overflowing
with
sorrow
and
love
but
at
the
same
time
they
preserved
a
solemn
silence
and
their
every
movement
was
full
of
gravity
and
reverence
nothing
broke
the
stillness
save
an
occasional
smothered
word
of
lamentation
or
a
stifled
groan
which
escaped
from
one
or
other
of
these
holy
personages
in
spite
of
their
earnest
eagerness
and
deep
attention
to
their
pious
labour
magdalen
gave
way
unrestrainedly
to
her
sorrow
and
neither
the
presence
of
so
many
different
persons
nor
any
other
consideration
appeared
to
distract
her
from
it
nicodemus
and
joseph
placed
the
ladders
behind
the
cross
and
mounted
them
holding
in
their
hands
a
large
sheet
to
which
three
long
straps
were
fastened
they
tied
the
body
of
jesus
below
the
arms
and
knees
to
the
tree
of
the
cross
and
secured
the
arms
by
pieces
of
linen
placed
underneath
the
hands
then
they
drew
out
the
nails
by
pushing
them
from
behind
with
strong
pins
pressed
upon
the
points
the
sacred
hands
of
jesus
were
thus
not
much
shaken
and
the
nails
fell
easily
out
of
the
wounds
for
the
latter
had
been
made
wider
by
the
weight
of
the
body
which
being
now
supported
by
the
cloths
no
longer
hung
on
the
nails
the
lower
part
of
the
body
which
since
our
death
had
sunk
down
on
the
knees
now
rested
in
a
natural
position
supported
by
a
sheet
fastened
above
to
the
arms
of
the
cross
whilst
joseph
was
taking
out
the
nail
from
the
left
hand
and
then
allowing
the
left
arm
supported
by
its
cloth
to
fall
gently
down
upon
the
body
nicodemus
was
fastening
the
right
arm
of
jesus
to
that
of
the
cross
as
also
the
sacred
crowned
head
which
had
sunk
on
the
right
shoulder
then
he
took
out
the
right
nail
and
having
surrounded
the
arm
with
its
supporting
sheet
let
it
fall
gently
on
to
the
body
at
the
same
time
the
centurion
abenadar
with
great
difficulty
drew
out
the
large
nail
which
transfixed
the
feet
cassius
devoutly
received
the
nails
and
laid
them
at
the
feet
of
the
blessed
virgin
then
joseph
and
nicodemus
having
placed
ladders
against
the
front
of
the
cross
in
a
very
upright
position
and
close
to
the
body
untied
the
upper
strap
and
fastened
it
to
one
of
the
hooks
on
the
ladder
they
did
the
same
with
the
two
other
straps
and
passing
them
all
on
from
hook
to
hook
caused
the
sacred
body
to
descend
gently
towards
the
centurion
who
having
mounted
upon
a
stool
received
it
in
his
arms
holding
it
below
the
knees
while
joseph
and
nicodemus
supporting
the
upper
part
of
the
body
came
gently
down
the
ladder
stopping
at
every
step
and
taking
every
imaginable
precaution
as
would
be
done
by
men
bearing
the
body
of
some
beloved
friend
who
had
been
grievously
wounded
thus
did
the
bruised
body
of
our
divine
saviour
reach
the
ground
it
was
a
most
touching
sight
they
all
took
the
same
precautions
the
same
care
as
if
they
had
feared
to
cause
jesus
some
suffering
they
seemed
to
have
concentrated
on
the
sacred
body
all
the
love
and
veneration
which
they
had
felt
for
their
saviour
during
his
life
the
eyes
of
each
were
fixed
upon
the
adorable
body
and
followed
all
its
movements
and
they
were
continually
uplifting
their
hands
towards
heaven
shedding
tears
and
expressing
in
every
possible
way
the
excess
of
their
grief
and
anguish
yet
they
all
remained
perfectly
calm
and
even
those
who
were
so
busily
occupied
about
the
sacred
body
broke
silence
but
seldom
and
when
obliged
to
make
some
necessary
remark
did
so
in
a
low
voice
during
the
time
that
the
nails
were
being
forcible
removed
by
blows
of
the
hammer
the
blessed
virgin
magdalen
and
all
those
who
had
been
present
at
the
crucifixion
felt
each
blow
transfix
their
hearts
the
sound
recalled
to
their
minds
all
the
sufferings
of
jesus
and
they
could
not
control
their
trembling
fear
lest
they
should
again
hear
his
piercing
cry
of
suffering
although
at
the
same
time
they
grieved
at
the
silence
of
his
blessed
lips
which
proved
alas
too
surely
that
he
was
really
dead
when
the
body
was
taken
down
it
was
wrapped
in
linen
from
the
knees
to
the
waist
and
then
placed
in
the
arms
of
the
blessed
virgin
who
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
and
love
stretched
them
forth
to
receive
their
precious
burden

no
precaution
had
been
neglected
which
could
in
any
way
facilitate
to
her
the
mother
of
sorrows
in
her
deep
affliction
of
soul
the
mournful
but
most
sacred
duty
which
she
was
about
to
fulfil
in
regard
to
the
body
of
her
beloved
son
the
adorable
head
of
jesus
rested
upon
mary
knee
and
his
body
was
stretched
upon
a
sheet
the
blessed
virgin
was
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
and
love
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
did
she
hold
in
her
arms
the
body
of
her
most
beloved
son
to
whom
she
had
been
unable
to
give
any
testimony
of
love
during
the
long
hours
of
his
martyrdom
and
she
gazed
upon
his
wounds
and
fondly
embraced
his
cheeks
while
magdalen
pressed
her
face
upon
his
feet
the
men
withdrew
into
a
little
cave
situated
on
the
side
of
calvary
there
to
prepare
the
different
things
needful
for
the
embalming
but
cassius
with
a
few
other
soldiers
who
had
been
converted
remained
at
a
respectful
distance
all
persons
were
gone
back
to
the
city
and
the
soldiers
who
were
present
served
merely
to
form
a
guard
to
prevent
any
interruption
in
the
last
honours
which
were
being
rendered
to
the
body
of
jesus
some
of
these
soldiers
even
gave
assistance
when
desired
the
holy
women
held
the
vases
sponges
linen
unction
and
spices
according
as
required
but
when
not
thus
employed
they
remained
at
a
respectful
distance
attentively
gazing
upon
the
blessed
virgin
as
she
proceeded
in
her
mournful
task
magdalen
did
not
leave
the
body
of
jesus
but
john
gave
continual
assistance
to
the
blessed
virgin
and
went
to
and
fro
from
the
men
to
the
women
lending
aid
to
both
parties
the
women
had
with
them
some
large
leathern
bottles
and
a
vase
filled
with
water
standing
upon
a
coal
fire
they
gave
the
blessed
virgin
and
magdalen
according
as
they
required
vases
filled
with
clear
water
and
sponges
which
they
afterwards
squeezed
in
the
leathern
bottles
the
courage
and
firmness
of
mary
remained
unshaken
even
in
the
midst
of
her
inexpressible
it
was
absolutely
impossible
for
her
to
leave
the
body
of
her
son
in
the
awful
state
to
which
it
had
been
reduced
by
his
sufferings
and
therefore
she
began
with
indefatigable
earnestness
to
wash
and
purify
it
from
the
traces
of
the
outrages
to
which
it
had
been
exposed
with
the
utmost
care
she
drew
off
the
crown
of
thorns
opening
it
behind
and
then
cutting
off
one
by
one
the
thorns
which
had
sunk
deep
into
the
head
of
jesus
in
order
that
she
might
not
widen
the
wounds
the
crown
was
placed
by
the
side
of
the
nails
and
then
mary
drew
out
the
thorns
which
had
remained
in
the
skin
with
a
species
of
rounded
pincers
and
sorrowfully
showed
them
to
her
these
thorns
were
placed
with
the
crown
but
still
some
of
them
must
have
been
preserved
separately
the
divine
face
of
our
saviour
was
scarcely
recognisable
so
disfigured
was
it
by
the
wounds
with
which
it
was
covered
the
beard
and
hair
were
matted
together
with
blood
mary
washed
the
head
and
face
and
passed
damp
sponges
over
the
hair
to
remove
the
congealed
blood
as
she
proceeded
in
her
pious
office
the
extent
of
the
awful
cruelty
which
had
been
exercised
upon
jesus
became
more
and
more
apparent
and
caused
in
her
soul
emotions
of
compassion
and
tenderness
which
increased
as
she
passed
from
one
wound
to
another
she
washed
the
wounds
of
the
head
the
eyes
filled
with
blood
the
nostrils
and
the
ears
with
a
sponge
and
a
small
piece
of
linen
spread
over
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
and
then
she
purified
in
the
same
manner
the
mouth
the
tongue
the
teeth
and
the
lips
she
divided
what
remained
of
our
lord
hair
into
three
parts
a
part
falling
over
each
temple
and
the
third
over
the
back
of
his
head
and
when
she
had
disentangled
the
front
hair
and
smoothed
it
she
passed
it
behind
his
when
the
head
was
thoroughly
cleansed
and
purified
the
blessed
virgin
covered
it
with
a
veil
after
having
kissed
the
sacred
cheeks
of
her
dear
son
she
then
turned
her
attention
to
the
neck
shoulders
chest
back
arms
and
pierced
hands
all
the
bones
of
the
breast
and
the
joints
were
dislocated
and
could
not
be
bent
there
was
a
frightful
wound
on
the
shoulders
which
had
borne
the
weight
of
the
cross
and
all
the
upper
part
of
the
body
was
covered
with
bruises
and
deeply
marked
with
blows
of
the
scourges
on
the
left
breast
there
was
a
small
wound
where
the
point
of
cassius
lance
had
come
out
and
on
the
right
side
was
the
large
wound
made
by
the
same
lance
and
which
had
pierced
the
heart
through
and
through
mary
washed
all
these
wounds
and
magdalen
on
her
knees
helped
her
from
time
to
time
but
without
leaving
the
sacred
feet
of
jesus
which
she
bathed
with
tears
and
wiped
with
her
hair
the
head
bosom
and
feet
of
our
lord
were
now
washed
and
the
sacred
body
which
was
covered
with
brown
stains
and
red
marks
in
those
places
where
the
skin
had
been
torn
off
and
of
a
colour
like
flesh
that
has
been
drained
of
blood
was
resting
on
the
knees
of
mary
who
covered
the
parts
which
she
had
washed
with
a
veil
and
then
proceeded
to
embalm
all
the
wounds
the
holy
women
knelt
by
her
side
and
in
turn
presented
to
her
a
box
out
of
which
she
took
some
precious
ointment
and
with
it
filled
and
covered
the
wounds
she
also
anointed
the
hair
and
then
taking
the
sacred
hands
of
jesus
in
her
left
hand
respectfully
kissed
them
and
filled
the
large
wounds
made
by
the
nails
with
this
ointment
or
sweet
spice
she
likewise
filled
the
ears
nostrils
and
wound
in
the
side
with
the
same
precious
mixture
meanwhile
magdalen
wiped
and
embalmed
our
lord
feet
and
then
again
washed
them
with
her
tears
and
often
pressed
her
face
upon
them
the
water
which
had
been
used
was
not
thrown
away
but
poured
into
the
leathern
bottles
in
which
the
sponges
had
been
squeezed
i
saw
cassius
or
some
other
soldier
go
several
times
to
fetch
fresh
water
from
the
fountain
of
gihon
which
was
at
no
great
distance
off
when
the
blessed
virgin
had
filled
all
the
wounds
with
ointment
she
wrapped
the
head
up
in
linen
cloths
but
she
did
not
as
yet
cover
the
face
she
closed
the
eyes
of
jesus
and
kept
her
hand
upon
them
for
some
time
she
also
closed
the
mouth
and
then
embraced
the
sacred
body
of
her
beloved
son
pressing
her
face
fondly
and
reverently
upon
his
joseph
and
nicodemus
had
been
waiting
for
some
time
when
john
drew
near
to
the
blessed
virgin
and
besought
her
to
permit
the
body
of
her
son
to
be
taken
from
her
that
the
embalming
might
be
completed
because
the
sabbath
was
close
at
hand
once
more
did
mary
embrace
the
sacred
body
of
jesus
and
utter
her
farewells
in
the
most
touching
language
and
then
the
men
lifted
it
from
her
arms
on
the
sheet
and
carried
it
to
some
distance
the
deep
sorrow
of
mary
had
been
for
the
time
assuaged
by
the
feelings
of
love
and
reverence
with
which
she
had
accomplished
her
sacred
task
but
now
it
once
more
overwhelmed
her
and
she
fell
her
head
covered
with
her
veil
into
the
arms
of
the
holy
women
magdalen
felt
almost
as
though
her
beloved
were
being
forcibly
carried
away
from
her
and
hastily
ran
forward
a
few
steps
with
her
arms
stretched
forth
but
then
after
a
moment
returned
to
the
blessed
virgin
the
sacred
body
was
carried
to
a
spot
beneath
the
level
of
the
top
of
golgotha
where
the
smooth
surface
of
a
rock
afforded
a
convenient
platform
on
which
to
embalm
the
body
i
first
saw
a
piece
of
linen
looking
very
much
like
lace
and
which
made
me
think
of
the
large
embroidered
curtain
hung
between
the
choir
and
nave
during
it
was
probably
worked
in
that
open
stitch
for
the
water
to
run
through
i
also
saw
another
large
sheet
unfolded
the
body
of
our
saviour
was
placed
on
the
piece
of
linen
and
some
of
the
other
men
held
the
other
sheet
spread
above
it
nicodemus
and
joseph
then
knelt
down
and
underneath
this
covering
took
off
the
linen
which
they
had
fastened
round
the
loins
of
our
saviour
when
they
took
his
body
down
from
the
cross
they
then
passed
sponges
under
this
sheet
and
washed
the
lower
parts
of
the
body
after
which
they
lifted
it
up
by
the
help
of
pieces
of
linen
crossed
beneath
the
loins
and
knees
and
washed
the
back
without
turning
it
over
they
continued
washing
until
nothing
but
clear
water
came
from
the
sponges
when
pressed
next
they
poured
water
of
myrrh
over
the
whole
body
and
then
handling
it
with
respect
stretched
it
out
full
length
for
it
was
still
in
the
position
in
which
our
divine
lord
had
died
the
loins
and
knees
bent
they
then
placed
beneath
his
hips
a
sheet
which
was
a
yard
in
width
and
three
in
length
laid
upon
his
lap
bundles
of
herbs
and
shook
over
the
whole
body
a
powder
which
nicodemus
had
brought
next
they
wrapped
up
the
lower
part
of
the
body
and
fastened
the
cloth
which
they
had
placed
underneath
round
it
strongly
after
this
they
anointed
the
wounds
of
the
thighs
placed
bundles
of
herbs
between
the
legs
which
were
stretched
out
to
their
full
length
and
wrapped
them
up
entirely
in
these
sweet
spices
then
john
conducted
the
blessed
virgin
and
the
other
holy
women
once
more
to
the
side
of
the
body
mary
knelt
down
by
the
head
of
jesus
and
placed
beneath
it
a
piece
of
very
fine
linen
which
had
been
given
her
by
pilate
wife
and
which
she
had
worn
round
her
neck
under
her
cloak
next
assisted
by
the
holy
women
she
placed
from
the
shoulders
to
the
cheeks
bundles
of
herbs
spices
and
powder
and
then
strongly
bound
this
piece
of
linen
round
the
head
and
shoulders
magdalen
poured
besides
a
small
bottle
of
balm
into
the
wound
of
the
side
and
the
holy
women
placed
some
more
herbs
into
those
of
the
hands
and
feet
then
the
men
put
sweet
spices
around
all
the
remainder
of
the
body
crossed
the
sacred
stiffened
arms
on
the
chest
and
bound
the
large
white
sheet
round
the
body
as
high
as
the
chest
in
the
same
manner
as
if
they
had
been
swaddling
a
child
then
having
fastened
the
end
of
a
large
band
beneath
the
armpits
they
rolled
it
round
the
head
and
the
whole
body
finally
they
placed
our
divine
lord
on
the
large
sheet
six
yards
in
length
which
joseph
of
arimathea
had
bought
and
wrapped
him
in
it
he
was
lying
diagonally
upon
it
and
one
corner
of
the
sheet
was
raised
from
the
feet
to
the
chest
the
other
drawn
over
the
head
and
shoulders
while
the
remaining
two
ends
were
doubled
round
the
body
the
blessed
virgin
the
holy
women
the
men
all
were
kneeling
round
the
body
of
jesus
to
take
their
farewell
of
it
when
a
most
touching
miracle
took
place
before
them
the
sacred
body
of
jesus
with
all
its
wounds
appeared
imprinted
upon
the
cloth
which
covered
it
as
though
he
had
been
pleased
to
reward
their
care
and
their
love
and
leave
them
a
portrait
of
himself
through
all
the
veils
with
which
he
was
enwrapped
with
tears
they
embraced
the
adorable
body
and
then
reverently
kissed
the
wonderful
impression
which
it
had
left
their
astonishment
increased
when
on
lifting
up
the
sheet
they
saw
that
all
the
bands
which
surrounded
the
body
had
remained
white
as
before
and
that
the
upper
cloth
alone
had
been
marked
in
this
wonderful
manner
it
was
not
a
mark
made
by
the
bleeding
wounds
since
the
whole
body
was
wrapped
up
and
covered
with
sweet
spices
but
it
was
a
supernatural
portrait
bearing
testimony
to
the
divine
creative
power
ever
abiding
in
the
body
of
jesus
i
have
seen
many
things
relative
to
the
subsequent
history
of
this
piece
of
linen
but
i
could
not
describe
them
coherently
after
the
resurrection
it
remained
in
the
possession
of
the
friends
of
jesus
but
fell
twice
into
the
hands
of
the
jews
and
later
was
honoured
in
several
different
places
i
have
seen
it
in
a
city
of
asia
in
the
possession
of
some
christians
who
were
not
catholics
i
have
forgotten
the
name
of
the
town
which
is
situated
in
a
province
near
the
country
of
the
three
kings
chapter
lii
the
body
of
our
lord
placed
in
the
sepulchre
the
men
placed
the
sacred
body
on
a
species
of
leathern
which
they
covered
wit
a
cloth
and
to
which
they
fastened
two
long
stakes
this
forcibly
reminded
me
of
the
ark
of
the
covenant
nicodemus
and
joseph
bore
on
their
shoulders
the
front
shafts
while
abenadar
and
john
supported
those
behind
after
them
came
the
blessed
virgin
mary
of
heli
her
eldest
sister
magdalen
and
mary
of
cleophas
and
then
the
group
of
women
who
had
been
sitting
at
some
distance
veronica
johanna
chusa
mary
salome
salome
of
jerusalem
susanna
and
anne
the
niece
of
joseph
cassius
and
the
soldiers
closed
the
procession
the
other
women
such
as
marone
of
naim
dina
the
samaritaness
and
mara
the
suphanitess
were
at
bethania
with
martha
and
lazarus
two
soldiers
bearing
torches
in
their
hands
walked
on
first
that
there
might
be
some
light
in
the
grotto
of
the
sepulchre
and
the
procession
continued
to
advance
in
this
order
for
about
seven
minutes
the
holy
men
and
women
singing
psalms
in
sweet
but
melancholy
tones
i
saw
james
the
greater
the
brother
of
john
standing
upon
a
hill
the
other
side
of
the
valley
to
look
at
them
as
they
passed
and
he
returned
immediately
afterwards
to
tell
the
other
disciples
what
he
had
seen
the
procession
stopped
at
the
entrance
of
joseph
garden
which
was
opened
by
the
removal
of
some
stakes
afterwards
used
as
levers
to
roll
the
stone
to
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
when
opposite
the
rock
they
placed
the
sacred
body
on
a
long
board
covered
with
a
sheet
the
grotto
which
had
been
newly
excavated
had
been
latterly
cleaned
by
the
servants
of
nicodemus
so
that
the
interior
was
neat
and
pleasing
to
the
eye
the
holy
women
sat
down
in
front
of
the
grotto
while
the
four
men
carried
in
the
body
of
our
lord
partially
filled
the
hollow
couch
destined
for
its
reception
with
aromatic
spices
and
spread
over
them
a
cloth
upon
which
they
reverently
deposited
the
sacred
body
after
having
once
more
given
expression
to
their
love
by
tears
and
fond
embraces
they
left
the
grotto
then
the
blessed
virgin
entered
seated
herself
close
to
the
head
of
her
dear
son
and
bent
over
his
body
with
many
tears
when
she
left
the
grotto
magdalen
hastily
and
eagerly
came
forward
and
flung
on
the
body
some
flowers
and
branches
which
she
had
gathered
in
the
garden
then
she
clasped
her
hands
together
and
with
sobs
kissed
the
feet
of
jesus
but
the
men
having
informed
her
that
they
must
close
the
sepulchre
she
returned
to
the
other
women
they
covered
the
sacred
body
with
the
extremities
of
the
sheet
on
which
it
was
lying
placed
on
the
top
of
all
the
brown
coverlet
and
closed
the
which
were
made
of
a
metal
and
had
on
their
front
two
sticks
one
straight
down
and
the
other
across
so
as
to
form
a
perfect
cross
the
large
stone
with
which
they
intended
to
close
the
sepulchre
and
which
was
still
lying
in
front
of
the
grotto
was
in
shape
very
like
a
chest
or
tomb
its
length
was
such
that
a
man
might
have
laid
himself
down

it
was
so
heavy
that
it
was
only
by
means
of
levers
that
the
men
could
roll
it
before
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
the
entrance
of
the
grotto
was
closed
by
a
gate
made
of
branches
twined
together
everything
that
was
done
within
the
grotto
had
to
be
accomplished
by
torchlight
for
daylight
never
penetrated

the
return
from
the
sepulchre
joseph
of
arimathea
is
put
in
prison
the
sabbath
was
close
at
hand
and
nicodemus
and
joseph
returned
to
jerusalem
by
a
small
door
not
far
from
the
garden
and
which
joseph
had
been
allowed
by
special
favour
to
have
made
in
the
city
wall
they
told
the
blessed
virgin
magdalen
john
and
some
of
the
women
who
were
returning
to
calvary
to
pray
there
that
this
door
as
well
as
that
of
the
would
be
opened
to
them
whenever
they
knocked
the
elder
sister
of
the
blessed
virgin
mary
of
heli
returned
to
the
town
with
mary
the
mother
of
mark
and
some
other
women
the
servants
of
nicodemus
and
joseph
went
to
calvary
to
fetch
several
things
which
had
been
left
there
the
soldiers
joined
those
who
were
guarding
the
city
gate
near
calvary
and
cassius
went
to
pilate
with
the
lance
related
all
that
he
had
seen
and
promised
to
give
him
an
exact
account
of
everything
that
should
happen
if
he
would
put
under
his
command
the
guards
whom
the
jews
would
not
fail
to
ask
to
have
put
round
the
tomb
pilate
listened
to
his
words
with
secret
terror
but
only
told
him
in
reply
that
his
superstition
amounted
to
madness
joseph
and
nicodemus
met
peter
and
the
two
jameses
in
the
town
they
all
shed
many
tears
but
peter
was
perfectly
overwhelmed
by
the
violence
of
this
grief
he
embraced
them
reproached
himself
for
not
having
been
present
at
the
death
of
our
saviour
and
thanked
them
for
having
bestowed
the
rites
of
sepulture
upon
his
sacred
body
it
was
agreed
that
the
door
of
the
should
be
opened
to
them
whenever
they
knocked
and
then
they
went
away
to
seek
some
other
disciples
who
were
dispersed
in
various
directions
later
i
saw
the
blessed
virgin
and
her
companions
enter
the
abenadar
next
came
and
was
admitted
and
by
degrees
the
greatest
part
of
the
apostles
and
disciples
assembled
there
the
holy
women
retired
to
that
part
of
the
building
where
the
blessed
virgin
was
living
they
took
some
food
and
spent
a
few
minutes
more
in
tears
and
in
relating
to
one
another
what
each
had
seen
then
men
changed
their
dresses
and
i
saw
them
standing
under
the
lamp
and
keeping
the
sabbath
they
ate
some
lambs
in
the
but
without
observing
any
ceremony
for
they
had
eaten
the
paschal
lamb
the
evening
before
they
were
all
perturbed
in
spirit
and
filled
with
grief
the
holy
women
also
passed
their
time
in
praying
with
the
blessed
virgin
under
the
lamp
later
when
night
had
quite
fallen
lazarus
the
widow
of
naim
dina
the
samaritan
woman
and
mara
of
suphan
came
from
bethania
and
then
once
more
descriptions
were
given
of
all
that
had
taken
place
and
many
tears
shed
according
to
the
visions
of
sister
emmerich
the
three
women
named
in
the
text
had
been
living
for
some
time
at
bethania
in
a
sort
of
community
established
by
martha
for
the
purpose
of
providing
for
the
maintenance
of
the
disciples
when
our
lord
was
moving
about
and
for
the
division
and
distribution
of
the
alms
which
were
collected
the
widow
of
naim
whose
son
martial
was
raised
from
the
dead
by
jesus
according
to
sister
emmerich
on
the
marcheswan
the
of
november
was
named
maroni
she
was
the
daughter
of
an
uncle
on
the
father
side
of
peter
her
first
husband
was
the
son
of
a
sister
of
elizabeth
who
herself
was
the
daughter
of
a
sister
of
the
mother
of
anne
maroni
first
husband
having
died
without
children
she
had
married
elind
a
relation
of
anne
and
had
left
chasaluth
near
tabor
to
take
up
her
abode
at
naim
which
was
not
far
off
and
where
she
soon
lost
her
second
husband
dina
the
samaritan
woman
was
the
same
who
conversed
with
jesus
by
jacob
well
she
was
born
near
damascus
of
parents
who
were
half
jewish
and
half
pagan
they
died
while
she
was
yet
very
young
and
she
being
brought
up
by
a
woman
of
bad
character
the
seeds
of
the
most
evil
passions
were
early
sown
in
her
heart
she
had
had
several
husbands
who
supplanted
one
another
in
turn
and
the
last
lived
at
sichar
whither
she
had
followed
him
and
changed
her
name
from
dina
to
salome
she
had
three
daughters
and
two
sons
who
afterwards
joined
the
disciples
sister
emmerich
used
to
say
that
the
life
of
this
samaritan
woman
was
prophetic
that
jesus
had
spoken
to
the
entire
sect
of
samaritans
in
her
person
and
that
they
were
attached
to
their
errors
by
as
many
ties
as
she
had
committed
adulteries
mara
of
suphan
was
a
moabitess
came
from
the
neighbourhood
of
suphan
and
was
a
descendant
of
orpha
the
widow
of
chelion
noemi
son
orpha
had
married
again
in
moab
by
orpha
the
of
ruth
mara
was
connected
with
the
family
of
david
from
whom
our
lord
was
descended
sister
emmerich
saw
jesus
deliver
mara
from
four
devils
and
grant
her
forgiveness
of
her
sins
on
the
elud
september
of
the
second
year
of
his
public
life
she
was
living
at
ainon
having
been
repudiated
by
her
husband
a
rich
jew
who
had
kept
the
children
he
had
had
by
her
with
him
she
had
with
her
tree
others
the
offspring
of
her
adulteries
saw
sister
emmerich
would
say
saw
how
the
stray
branch
of
the
stock
of
david
was
purified
within
her
by
the
grace
of
jesus
and
admitted
into
the
bosom
of
the
church
i
can
not
express
how
many
of
these
roots
and
offshoots
i
see
become
entwined
with
each
other
lost
to
view
and
then
once
more
brought
to
light
joseph
of
arimathea
returned
home
late
from
the
and
he
was
sorrowfully
walking
along
the
streets
of
sion
accompanied
by
a
few
disciples
and
women
when
all
on
a
sudden
a
band
of
armed
men
who
were
lying
in
ambuscade
in
the
neighbourhood
of
caiphas
tribunal
fell
upon
them
and
laid
hands
upon
joseph
whereupon
his
companions
fled
uttering
loud
cries
of
terror
he
was
confined
in
a
tower
contiguous
to
the
city
wall
not
far
from
the
tribunal
these
soldiers
were
pagans
and
had
not
to
keep
the
sabbath
therefore
caiphas
had
been
able
to
secure
their
services
on
this
occasion
the
intention
was
to
let
joseph
die
of
hunger
and
keep
his
disappearance
a
secret
here
conclude
the
descriptions
of
all
that
occurred
on
the
day
of
the
passion
of
our
lord
but
we
will
add
some
supplementary
matter
concerning
holy
saturday
the
descent
into
hell
and
the
resurrection
chapter
liv
on
the
name
of
calvary
whilst
meditating
on
the
name
of
golgotha
calvary
the
place
of
skulls
borne
by
the
rock
upon
which
jesus
was
crucified
i
became
deeply
absorbed
in
contemplation
and
beheld
in
spirit
all
ages
from
the
time
of
adam
to
that
of
christ
and
in
this
vision
the
origin
of
the
name
was
made
known
to
me
i
here
give
all
that
i
remember
on
this
subject
i
saw
adam
after
his
expulsion
from
paradise
weeping
in
the
grotto
where
jesus
sweated
blood
and
water
on
mount
olivet
i
saw
how
seth
was
promised
to
eve
in
the
grotto
of
the
manger
at
bethlehem
and
how
she
brought
him
forth
in
that
same
grotto
i
also
saw
eve
living
in
some
caverns
near
hebron
where
the
essenian
monastery
of
maspha
was
afterwards
established
i
then
beheld
the
country
where
jerusalem
was
built
as
it
appeared
after
the
deluge
and
the
land
was
all
unsettled
black
stony
and
very
different
from
what
it
had
been
before
at
an
immense
dept
below
the
rock
which
constitutes
mount
calvary
which
was
formed
in
this
spot
by
the
rolling
of
the
waters
i
saw
the
tomb
of
adam
and
eve
the
head
and
one
rib
were
wanting
to
one
of
the
skeletons
and
the
remaining
head
was
placed
within
the
same
skeleton
to
which
it
did
not
belong
the
bones
of
adam
and
eve
had
not
all
been
left
in
this
grave
for
noah
had
some
of
them
with
him
in
the
ark
and
they
were
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
by
the
patriarchs
noah
and
also
abraham
were
in
the
habit
when
offering
sacrifice
of
always
laying
some
of
adam
bones
upon
the
altar
to
remind
the
almighty
of
his
promise
when
jacob
gave
joseph
his
variegated
robe
he
at
the
same
time
gave
him
some
bones
of
adam
to
be
kept
as
relics
joseph
always
wore
them
on
his
bosom
and
they
were
placed
with
his
own
bones
in
the
first
reliquary
which
the
children
of
israel
brought
out
of
egypt
i
have
seen
similar
things
but
some
i
have
forgotten
and
the
others
time
fails
me
to
describe
as
regards
the
origin
of
the
name
of
calvary
i
here
give
all
i
know
i
beheld
the
mountain
which
bears
this
name
as
it
was
in
the
time
of
the
prophet
eliseus
it
was
not
the
same
then
as
at
the
time
of
our
lord
crucifixion
but
was
a
hill
with
many
walls
and
caverns
resembling
tombs
upon
it
i
saw
the
prophet
eliseus
descend
into
these
caverns
i
can
not
say
whether
in
reality
or
only
in
a
vision
and
i
saw
him
take
out
a
skull
from
a
stone
sepulchre
in
which
bones
were
resting
someone
who
was
by
his
side
i
think
an
angel
said
to
him
is
the
skull
of
adam
the
prophet
was
desirous
to
take
it
away
but
his
companion
forbade
him
i
saw
upon
the
skull
some
few
hairs
of
a
fair
colour
i
learned
also
that
the
prophet
having
related
what
had
happened
to
him
the
spot
received
the
name
of
calvary
finally
i
saw
that
the
cross
of
jesus
was
placed
vertically
over
the
skull
of
adam
i
was
informed
that
this
spot
was
the
exact
centre
of
the
earth
and
at
the
same
time
i
was
shown
the
numbers
and
measures
proper
to
every
country
but
i
have
forgotten
them
individually
as
well
as
in
general
yet
i
have
seen
this
centre
from
above
and
as
it
were
from
a
view
in
that
way
a
person
sees
far
more
clearly
than
on
a
map
all
the
different
countries
mountains
deserts
seas
rivers
towns
and
even
the
smallest
places
whether
distant
or
near
at
hand
chapter
lv
the
cross
and
the
winepress
as
i
was
meditating
upon
these
words
or
thoughts
of
jesus
when
hanging
on
the
cross
am
pressed
like
wine
placed
here
under
the
press
for
the
first
time
my
blood
must
continue
to
flow
until
water
comes
but
wine
shall
no
more
be
made
here
an
explanation
was
given
me
by
means
of
another
vision
relating
to
calvary
i
saw
this
rocky
country
at
a
period
anterior
to
the
deluge
it
was
then
less
wild
and
less
barren
than
it
afterwards
became
and
was
laid
out
in
vineyards
and
fields
i
saw
there
the
patriarch
japhet
a
majestic
old
man
surrounded
by
immense
flocks
and
herds
and
a
numerous
posterity
his
children
as
well
as
himself
had
dwellings
excavated
in
the
ground
and
covered
with
turf
roofs
on
which
herbs
and
flowers
were
growing
there
were
vines
all
around
and
a
new
method
of
making
wine
was
being
tried
on
calvary
in
the
presence
of
japhet
i
saw
also
the
ancient
method
of
preparing
wine
but
i
can
give
only
the
following
description
of
it
at
first
men
were
satisfied
with
only
eating
the
grapes
then
they
pressed
them
with
pestles
in
hollow
stones
and
finally
in
large
wooden
trenches
upon
this
occasion
a
new
resembling
the
holy
cross
in
shape
had
been
devised
it
consisted
of
the
hollow
trunk
of
a
tree
placed
upright
with
a
bag
of
grapes
suspended
over
it
upon
this
bag
there
was
fastened
a
pestle
surmounted
by
a
weight
and
on
both
sides
of
the
trunk
were
arms
joined
to
the
bag
through
openings
made
for
the
purpose
and
which
when
put
in
motion
by
lowering
the
ends
crushed
the
grapes
the
juice
flowed
out
of
the
tree
by
five
openings
and
fell
into
a
stone
vat
from
whence
it
flowed
through
a
channel
made
of
bark
and
coated
with
resin
into
the
species
of
cistern
excavated
in
the
rock
where
jesus
was
confined
before
his
crucifixion
at
the
foot
of
the
winepress
in
the
stone
vat
there
was
a
sort
of
sieve
to
stop
the
skins
which
were
put
on
one
side
when
they
had
made
their
winepress
they
filled
the
bag
with
grapes
nailed
it
to
the
top
of
the
trunk
placed
the
pestle
and
put
in
motion
the
side
arms
in
order
to
make
the
wine
flow
all
this
very
strongly
reminded
me
of
the
crucifixion
on
account
of
the
resemblance
between
the
winepress
and
the
cross
they
had
a
long
reed
at
the
end
of
which
there
were
points
so
that
it
looked
like
an
enormous
thistle
and
they
ran
this
through
the
channel
and
trunk
of
the
tree
when
there
was
any
obstruction
i
was
reminded
of
the
lance
and
sponge
there
were
also
some
leathern
bottles
and
vases
made
of
bark
and
plastered
with
resin
i
saw
several
young
men
with
nothing
but
a
cloth
wrapped
round
their
loins
like
jesus
working
at
this
winepress
japhet
was
very
old
he
wore
a
long
beard
and
a
dress
made
of
the
skins
of
beasts
and
he
looked
at
the
new
winepress
with
evident
satisfaction
it
was
a
festival
day
and
they
sacrificed
on
a
stone
altar
some
animals
which
were
running
loose
in
the
vineyard
young
asses
goats
and
sheep
it
was
not
in
this
place
that
abraham
came
to
sacrifice
isaac
perhaps
it
was
on
mount
moriah
i
have
forgotten
many
of
the
instructions
regarding
the
wine
vinegar
and
skins
and
the
different
ways
in
which
everything
was
to
be
distributed
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
i
regret
it
because
the
veriest
trifles
in
these
matters
have
a
profound
symbolical
meaning
if
it
should
be
the
will
of
god
for
me
to
make
them
known
he
will
show
them
to
me
again
chapter
lvi
apparitions
on
occasion
of
the
death
of
jesus
among
the
dead
who
rose
from
their
graves
and
who
were
certainly
a
hundred
in
number
at
jerusalem
there
were
no
relations
of
jesus
i
saw
in
various
parts
of
the
holy
land
others
of
the
dead
appear
and
bear
testimony
to
the
divinity
of
jesus
thus
i
saw
sadoch
a
most
pious
man
who
had
given
all
his
property
to
the
poor
and
to
the
temple
appear
to
many
persons
in
the
neighbourhood
of
hebron
this
sadoch
had
lived
a
century
before
jesus
and
was
the
founder
of
a
community
of
essenians
he
had
ardently
sighed
for
the
coming
of
the
messias
and
had
had
several
revelations
upon
the
subject
i
saw
some
others
of
the
dead
appear
to
the
hidden
disciples
of
our
lord
and
give
them
different
warnings
terror
and
desolation
reigned
even
in
the
most
distant
parts
of
palestine
and
it
was
not
in
jerusalem
only
that
frightful
prodigies
took
place
at
thirza
the
towers
of
the
prison
in
which
the
captives
delivered
by
jesus
had
been
confined
fell
down
in
galilee
where
jesus
had
travelled
so
much
i
saw
many
buildings
and
in
particular
the
houses
of
those
pharisees
who
had
been
the
foremost
in
persecuting
our
saviour
and
who
were
then
all
at
the
festival
shaken
to
the
ground
crushing
their
wives
and
children
numerous
accidents
happened
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
lake
of
genazareth
many
buildings
fell
down
at
capharnaum
and
the
wall
of
rocks
which
was
in
front
of
the
beautiful
garden
of
the
centurion
zorobabel
cracked
across
the
lake
overflowed
into
the
valley
and
its
waters
descended
as
far
as
capharnaum
which
was
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
peter
house
and
the
dwelling
of
the
blessed
virgin
in
front
of
the
town
remained
standing
the
lake
was
strongly
convulsed
its
shores
crumbled
in
several
places
and
its
shape
was
very
much
altered
and
became
more
like
what
it
is
at
the
present
day
great
changes
took
place
particularly
at
the
extremity
near
tarichea
because
in
this
part
there
was
a
long
causeway
made
of
stones
between
the
lake
and
a
sort
of
marsh
which
gave
a
constant
direction
to
the
course
of
the
jordan
when
it
left
the
lake
the
whole
of
this
causeway
was
destroyed
by
the
earthquake
many
accidents
happened
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
lake
on
the
spot
where
the
swine
belonging
to
the
inhabitants
of
gergesa
cast
themselves
in
and
also
at
gergesa
gerasa
and
in
the
entire
district
of
chorazin
the
mountain
where
the
second
multiplication
of
the
loaves
took
place
was
shaken
and
the
stone
upon
which
the
miracle
had
been
worked
split
in
two
in
decapolis
whole
towns
crumbled
to
the
earth
and
in
asia
in
several
localities
the
earthquake
was
severely
felt
particularly
to
the
east
and
of
paneas
in
upper
galilee
many
pharisees
found
their
houses
in
ruins
when
they
returned
from
keeping
the
feast
a
number
of
them
while
yet
at
jerusalem
received
the
news
of
what
had
happened
and
it
was
on
that
account
that
the
enemies
of
jesus
made
such
very
slight
efforts
against
the
christian
community
at
pentecost
a
part
of
the
temple
of
garizim
crumbled
down
an
idol
stood
there
above
a
fountain
in
a
small
temple
the
roof
of
which
fell
into
the
fountain
with
the
idol
half
of
the
synagogue
of
nazareth
out
of
which
jesus
had
been
drive
fell
down
as
well
as
that
part
of
the
mountain
from
which
his
enemies
had
endeavoured
to
precipitate
him
the
bed
of
the
jordan
was
much
changed
by
all
these
shocks
and
its
course
altered
in
many
places
at
macherus
and
at
the
other
towns
belonging
to
herod
everything
remained
quiet
for
that
country
was
out
of
the
sphere
of
repentance
and
of
threats
like
those
men
who
did
not
fall
to
the
ground
in
the
garden
of
olives
and
consequently
did
not
rise
again
in
many
other
parts
where
there
were
evil
spirits
i
saw
the
latter
disappear
in
large
bodies
amid
the
falling
mountains
and
buildings
the
earthquakes
reminded
me
of
the
convulsions
of
the
possessed
when
the
enemy
feels
that
he
must
take
to
flight
at
gergesa
a
part
of
the
mountain
from
which
the
devils
had
cast
themselves
with
the
swine
into
a
marsh
fell
into
this
same
marsh
and
i
then
saw
a
band
of
evil
spirits
cast
themselves
into
the
abyss
like
a
dark
cloud
it
was
at
nice
unless
i
am
mistaken
that
i
saw
a
singular
occurrence
of
which
i
have
only
an
imperfect
remembrance
there
was
a
port
there
with
many
vessels
in
it
and
near
this
port
stood
a
house
with
a
high
tower
in
which
i
saw
a
pagan
whose
office
was
to
watch
these
vessels
he
had
often
to
ascend
this
tower
and
see
what
was
going
on
at
sea
having
heard
a
great
noise
over
the
vessels
in
the
port
he
hurriedly
ascended
the
tower
to
discover
what
was
taking
place
and
he
saw
several
dark
figures
hovering
over
the
port
and
who
exclaimed
to
him
in
plaintive
accents
thou
desirest
to
preserve
the
vessels
cause
them
to
be
sailed
out
of
this
port
for
we
must
return
to
the
abyss
the
great
pan
is
dead
they
told
him
several
other
things
laid
injunctions
upon
him
to
make
known
what
they
were
then
telling
him
upon
his
return
from
a
certain
voyage
which
he
was
soon
to
make
and
to
give
a
good
reception
to
the
messengers
who
would
come
to
announce
the
doctrine
of
him
who
had
just
died
the
evil
spirits
were
forced
in
this
manner
by
the
power
of
god
to
inform
this
good
man
of
their
defeat
and
announce
it
to
the
world
he
had
the
vessels
put
in
safety
and
then
an
awful
storm
arose
the
devils
cast
themselves
howling
into
the
sea
and
half
the
city
fell
down
his
house
remained
standing
soon
afterwards
he
went
on
a
great
journey
and
announced
the
death
of
the
great
pan
if
that
is
the
name
by
which
our
saviour
had
been
called
later
he
came
to
rome
where
much
amazement
was
caused
by
what
he
related
his
name
was
something
like
thamus
or
thramus
chapter
lvii
guards
are
placed
around
the
tomb
of
jesus
late
on
friday
night
i
saw
caiphas
and
some
of
the
chief
men
among
the
jews
holding
a
consultation
concerning
the
best
course
to
pursue
with
regard
to
the
prodigies
which
had
taken
place
and
the
effect
they
had
had
upon
the
people
they
continued
their
deliberations
quite
into
the
morning
and
then
hurried
to
pilate
house
to
tell
him
that
as
that
seducer
said
while
he
was
yet
alive
three
days
i
will
rise
again
it
would
be
right
to
command
the
sepulchre
to
be
guarded
until
the
third
day
as
otherwise
his
disciples
might
come
and
steal
him
away
and
say
to
the
people
is
risen
from
the
dead
and
the
last
error
would
be
worse
that
the
first
pilate
was
determined
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
business
and
he
only
answered
have
a
guard
go
guard
it
as
you
know
however
he
appointed
cassius
to
keep
a
watch
over
all
that
took
place
and
give
him
an
exact
account
of
every
circumstance
i
saw
these
men
twelve
in
number
leave
the
town
before
sunrise
accompanied
by
some
soldiers
who
did
not
wear
the
roman
uniform
being
attached
to
the
temple
they
carried
lanterns
fastened
to
the
end
of
long
poles
in
order
that
they
might
be
able
to
see
every
surrounding
object
in
spite
of
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
also
that
they
might
have
some
light
in
the
dark
cave
of
the
sepulchre
no
sooner
had
they
reached
the
sepulchre
than
having
first
seen
with
their
own
eyes
that
the
body
of
jesus
was
really
there
they
fastened
one
rope
across
the
door
of
the
tomb
and
a
second
across
the
great
stone
which
was
placed
in
front
sealing
the
whole
with
a
seal
of
shape
they
then
returned
to
the
city
and
the
guards
stationed
themselves
opposite
the
outer
door
they
were
five
or
six
in
number
and
watched
three
and
three
alternately
cassius
never
left
his
post
and
usually
remained
sitting
or
standing
in
front
of
the
entrance
to
the
cave
so
as
to
see
that
side
of
the
tomb
where
the
feet
of
our
lord
rested
he
had
received
many
interior
graces
and
been
given
to
understand
many
mysteries
being
wholly
unaccustomed
to
this
state
of
spiritual
enlightenment
he
was
perfectly
transported
out
of
himself
and
remained
nearly
all
the
time
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
exterior
things
he
was
entirely
changed
had
become
a
new
man
and
spent
the
whole
day
in
penance
in
making
fervent
acts
of
gratitude
and
in
humbly
adoring
god
chapter
lviii
a
glance
at
the
disciples
of
jesus
on
holy
saturday
the
faithful
disciples
of
our
lord
assembled
together
in
the
cenaculum
to
keep
the
eve
of
the
sabbath
they
were
about
twenty
in
number
clothed
in
long
white
dresses
and
with
their
waists
girded
the
room
was
lighted
up
by
a
lamp
and
after
their
repast
they
separated
and
for
the
most
part
returned
home
they
again
assembled
on
the
following
morning
and
sat
together
reading
and
praying
by
turns
and
if
a
friend
entered
the
room
they
arose
and
saluted
him
cordially
in
that
part
of
the
house
inhabited
by
the
blessed
virgin
there
was
a
large
room
divided
into
small
compartments
like
cells
which
were
used
by
the
holy
women
for
sleeping
in
at
night
when
they
returned
from
the
sepulchre
one
of
their
number
lighted
a
lamp
which
was
hanging
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
they
all
assembled
around
the
blessed
virgin
and
commenced
praying
in
a
mournful
but
recollected
manner
a
short
time
afterwards
martha
maroni
dina
and
mara
who
were
just
come
with
lazarus
from
bethania
where
they
had
passed
the
sabbath
entered
the
room
the
blessed
virgin
and
her
companions
gave
them
a
detailed
account
of
the
death
and
burial
of
our
lord
accompanying
each
relation
with
many
tears
the
evening
was
advancing
and
joseph
of
arimathea
came
in
with
a
few
other
disciples
to
ask
whether
any
of
the
women
wished
to
return
to
their
homes
as
they
were
ready
to
escort
them
a
few
accepted
the
proposition
and
set
off
immediately
but
before
they
reached
the
tribunal
of
caiphas
some
armed
men
stopped
joseph
of
arimathea
arrested
and
shut
him
up
in
an
old
deserted
turret
those
among
the
holy
women
who
did
not
leave
the
cenaculum
retired
to
take
their
rest
in
the
compartments
spoken
of
above
they
fastened
long
veils
over
their
heads
seated
themselves
sorrowfully
on
the
floor
and
leaned
upon
the
couches
which
were
placed
against
the
wall
after
a
time
they
stood
up
spread
out
the
bedclothes
which
were
rolled
up
on
the
couches
took
off
their
sandals
girdles
and
a
part
of
their
clothing
and
reclined
for
a
time
in
order
to
endeavour
to
get
a
little
sleep
at
midnight
they
arose
clothed
themselves
put
up
their
beds
and
reassembled
around
the
lamp
to
continue
their
prayer
with
the
blessed
virgin
when
the
mother
of
jesus
and
her
pious
companions
had
finished
their
nocturnal
prayer
that
holy
duty
which
has
been
practised
by
all
faithful
children
of
god
and
holy
souls
who
have
either
felt
themselves
called
to
it
by
a
special
grace
or
who
follow
a
rule
given
by
god
and
his
church
they
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
which
was
instantly
opened
and
john
and
some
of
the
disciples
who
had
promised
to
conduct
them
to
the
temple
entered
upon
which
the
women
wrapped
their
cloaks
about
them
and
started
instantly
it
was
then
about
three
in
the
morning
and
they
went
straight
to
the
temple
it
being
customary
among
many
jews
to
get
there
before
day
dawned
on
the
day
after
they
had
eaten
the
paschal
lamb
and
for
this
reason
the
temple
was
open
from
midnight
as
the
sacrifices
commenced
very
early
they
started
at
about
the
same
hour
as
that
at
which
the
priests
had
put
their
seal
upon
the
sepulchre
the
aspect
of
things
in
the
temple
was
however
very
different
from
what
was
usually
the
case
at
such
times
for
the
sacrifices
were
stopped
and
the
place
was
empty
and
desolate
as
everyone
had
left
on
account
of
the
events
on
the
previous
day
which
had
rendered
it
impure
the
blessed
virgin
appeared
to
me
to
visit
it
for
the
sole
purpose
of
taking
leave
of
the
place
where
she
had
passed
her
youth
the
temple
was
however
open
the
lamps
lighted
and
the
people
at
liberty
to
enter
the
vestibule
of
the
priests
which
was
the
customary
privilege
of
this
day
as
well
as
of
that
which
followed
the
paschal
supper
the
temple
was
as
i
said
before
quite
empty
with
the
exception
of
a
chance
priest
or
server
who
might
be
seen
wandering
about
and
every
part
bore
the
marks
of
the
confusion
into
which
all
was
thrown
on
the
previous
day
by
the
extraordinary
and
frightful
events
that
had
taken
place
besides
which
it
had
been
defiled
by
the
presence
of
the
dead
and
i
reflected
and
wondered
in
my
own
mind
whether
it
would
be
possible
ever
to
purify
if
again
the
sons
of
simeon
and
the
nephew
of
joseph
of
arimathea
were
much
grieved
when
they
heard
of
the
arrest
of
their
uncle
but
they
welcomed
the
blessed
virgin
and
her
companions
and
conducted
them
all
over
the
temple
which
they
did
without
difficulty
as
they
held
the
offices
of
inspectors
of
the
temple
the
holy
women
stood
in
silence
and
contemplated
all
the
terrible
and
visible
marks
of
the
anger
of
god
with
feelings
of
deep
awe
and
then
listened
with
interest
to
the
many
stupendous
details
recounted
by
their
guides
the
effects
of
the
earthquake
were
still
visible
as
little
had
been
done
towards
repairing
the
numerous
rents
and
cracks
in
the
floor
and
in
the
walls
in
that
part
of
the
temple
where
the
vestibule
joined
the
sanctuary
the
wall
was
so
tremendously
shaken
by
the
shock
of
the
earthquake
as
to
produce
a
fissure
wide
enough
for
a
person
to
walk
through
and
the
rest
of
the
wall
looked
unsteady
as
if
it
might
fall
down
at
any
moment
the
curtain
which
hung
in
the
sanctuary
was
rent
in
two
and
hung
in
shreds
at
the
sides
nothing
was
to
be
seen
around
but
crumbled
walls
crushed
flagstones
and
columns
either
partly
or
quite
shaken
down
the
blessed
virgin
visited
all
those
parts
which
jesus
had
rendered
sacred
in
her
eyes
she
prostrated
kissed
them
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
explained
to
the
others
her
reasons
for
venerating
each
particular
spot
whereupon
they
instantly
followed
her
example
the
greatest
veneration
was
always
shown
by
the
jews
for
all
places
which
had
been
rendered
sacred
by
manifestations
of
the
divine
power
and
it
was
customary
to
place
the
hands
reverently
on
such
places
to
kiss
them
and
to
prostrate
to
the
very
earth
before
them
i
do
not
think
there
was
anything
in
the
least
surprising
in
such
a
custom
for
they
both
knew
saw
end
felt
that
the
god
of
abraham
of
isaac
and
of
jacob
was
a
living
god
and
that
his
dwelling
among
his
people
was
in
the
temple
at
jerusalem
consequently
it
would
have
been
infinitely
more
astonishing
if
they
had
not
venerated
those
holy
parts
where
his
power
had
been
particularly
demonstrated
for
the
temple
and
the
holy
places
were
to
them
what
the
blessed
sacrament
is
to
christians
deeply
penetrated
with
these
feelings
of
respect
the
blessed
virgin
walked
trough
the
temple
with
her
companions
and
pointed
out
to
them
the
spot
where
she
was
presented
when
still
a
child
the
parts
where
she
passed
her
childhood
the
place
where
she
was
affianced
to
joseph
and
the
spot
where
she
stood
when
she
presented
jesus
and
heard
the
prophecy
of
simeon
the
remembrance
of
his
words
made
her
weep
bitterly
for
the
prophecy
was
indeed
fulfilled
and
the
sword
of
grief
had
indeed
transfixed
her
heart
she
again
stopped
her
companions
when
she
reached
the
part
of
the
temple
where
she
found
jesus
teaching
when
she
lost
him
at
the
age
of
twelve
and
she
respectfully
kissed
the
ground
on
which
he
then
stood
when
the
holy
women
had
looked
at
every
place
sanctified
by
the
presence
of
jesus
when
they
had
wept
and
prayed
over
them
they
returned
to
sion
the
blessed
virgin
did
not
leave
the
temple
without
shedding
many
tears
as
she
contemplated
the
state
of
desolation
to
which
it
was
reduced
an
aspect
of
desolation
which
was
rendered
still
more
depressing
by
the
marked
contrast
it
bore
to
the
usual
state
of
the
temple
on
the
festival
day
instead
of
songs
and
hymns
of
jubilee
a
mournful
silence
reigned
throughout
the
vast
edifice
and
in
place
of
groups
of
joyful
and
devout
worshippers
the
eye
wandered
over
a
vast
and
dreary
solitude
too
truly
alas
did
this
change
betoken
the
fearful
crime
which
had
been
perpetrated
by
the
people
of
god
and
she
remembered
how
jesus
had
wept
over
the
temple
and
said
the
temple
and
in
three
days
i
will
build
it
up
again
she
thought
over
the
destruction
of
the
temple
of
the
body
of
jesus
which
had
been
brought
about
by
his
enemies
and
she
sighed
with
a
longing
desire
for
the
dawning
of
that
third
day
when
the
words
of
eternal
truth
were
to
be
accomplished
it
was
about
daybreak
when
mary
and
her
companions
reached
the
cenaculum
and
they
retired
into
the
building
which
stood
on
its
side
while
john
and
some
of
the
disciples
the
cenaculum
where
about
twenty
men
assembled
around
a
lamp
were
occupied
in
prayer
every
now
and
then
drew
nigh
to
the
door
came
in
timidity
approached
the
group
round
the
lamp
and
addressed
them
in
a
few
mournful
words
which
they
accompanied
with
tears
everyone
appeared
to
regard
john
with
feelings
of
respect
because
he
had
remained
with
jesus
until
he
expired
but
with
these
sentiments
of
respect
was
mingled
a
deep
feeling
of
shame
and
confusion
when
they
reflected
on
their
own
cowardly
conduct
in
abandoning
their
lord
and
master
in
the
hour
of
need
john
spoke
to
everyone
with
the
greatest
charity
and
kindness
his
manner
was
modest
and
unassuming
as
that
of
a
child
and
he
seemed
to
fear
receiving
praise
i
saw
the
assembled
group
take
one
meal
during
that
day
but
its
members
were
for
the
most
part
silent
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
throughout
the
house
and
the
doors
were
tightly
closed
although
in
fact
there
was
no
likelihood
of
anyone
disturbing
them
as
the
house
belonged
to
nicodemus
and
he
had
let
it
to
them
for
the
time
of
the
festival
the
holy
women
remained
in
this
room
until
nightfall
it
was
lighted
up
by
a
single
lamp
the
doors
were
closed
and
curtains
drawn
over
the
windows
sometimes
they
gathered
round
the
blessed
virgin
and
prayed
under
the
lamp
at
other
times
they
retired
to
the
side
of
the
room
covered
their
heads
with
black
veils
and
either
sat
on
ashes
the
sign
of
mourning
or
prayed
with
their
faces
turned
towards
the
wall
those
whose
health
was
delicate
took
a
little
food
but
the
others
fasted
i
looked
at
them
again
and
again
and
i
saw
them
ever
occupied
in
the
same
manner
that
is
to
say
either
in
prayer
or
in
mourning
over
the
sufferings
of
their
beloved
master
when
my
thoughts
wandered
from
the
contemplation
of
the
blessed
virgin
to
that
of
her
divine
son
i
beheld
the
holy
sepulchre
with
six
or
seven
sentinels
at
the
entrance
cassius
standing
against
the
door
of
the
cave
apparently
in
deep
meditation
the
exterior
door
closed
and
the
stone
rolled
close
to
it
notwithstanding
the
thick
door
which
intervened
between
the
body
of
our
saviour
and
myself
i
could
see
it
plainly
it
was
quite
transparent
with
a
divine
light
and
two
angels
were
adoring
at
the
side
but
my
thoughts
then
turned
to
the
contemplation
of
the
blessed
soul
of
my
redeemer
and
such
an
extensive
and
complicated
picture
of
his
descent
into
hell
was
shown
to
me
that
i
can
only
remember
a
small
portion
of
it
which
i
will
describe
to
the
best
of
my
power
chapter
lix
a
detached
account
of
the
descent
into
hell
when
jesus
after
uttering
a
loud
cry
expired
i
saw
his
heavenly
soul
under
the
form
of
a
bright
meteor
pierce
the
earth
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
accompanied
by
the
angel
gabriel
and
many
other
angels
his
divine
nature
continued
united
to
his
soul
as
well
as
to
his
body
which
still
remained
hanging
upon
the
cross
but
i
can
not
explain
how
this
was
although
i
saw
it
plainly
in
my
own
mind
the
place
into
which
the
soul
of
jesus
entered
was
divided
into
three
parts
which
appeared
to
me
like
three
worlds
and
i
felt
that
they
were
round
and
that
each
division
was
separated
from
the
other
by
a
hemisphere
i
beheld
a
bright
and
beautiful
space
opposite
to
limbo
it
was
enamelled
with
flowers
delicious
breezes
wafted
through
it
and
many
souls
were
placed
there
before
being
admitted
into
heaven
after
their
deliverance
from
purgatory
limbo
the
place
where
the
souls
were
waiting
for
the
redemption
was
divided
into
different
compartments
and
encompassed
by
a
thick
foggy
atmosphere
our
lord
appeared
radiant
with
light
and
surrounded
by
angels
who
conducted
him
triumphantly
between
two
of
these
compartments
the
one
on
the
left
containing
the
patriarchs
who
lived
before
the
time
of
abraham
and
that
on
the
right
those
who
lived
between
the
days
of
abraham
and
john
the
baptist
these
souls
did
not
at
first
recognise
jesus
but
were
filled
nevertheless
with
sensations
of
joy
and
hope
there
was
not
a
spot
in
those
narrow
confines
which
did
not
as
it
were
dilate
with
feelings
of
happiness
the
passage
of
jesus
might
be
compared
to
the
wafting
of
a
breath
of
air
to
a
sudden
flash
of
light
or
to
a
shower
of
vivifying
dew
but
it
was
swift
as
a
whirlwind
after
passing
through
the
two
compartments
he
reached
a
dark
spot
in
which
adam
and
eve
were
standing
he
spoke
to
them
they
prostrated
and
adored
him
in
a
perfect
ecstasy
of
joy
and
they
immediately
joined
the
band
of
angels
and
accompanied
our
lord
to
the
compartment
on
the
left
which
contained
the
patriarchs
who
lived
before
abraham
this
compartment
was
a
species
of
purgatory
and
a
few
evil
spirits
were
wandering
about
among
the
souls
and
endeavouring
to
fill
them
with
anxiety
and
alarm
the
entrance
through
a
species
of
door
was
closed
but
the
angels
rapped
and
i
thought
i
heard
them
say
these
doors
when
jesus
entered
in
triumph
the
demons
dispersed
crying
out
at
the
same
time
is
there
between
thee
and
us
what
art
thou
come
to
do
here
wilt
thou
crucify
us
likewise
the
angels
hunted
them
away
having
first
chained
them
the
poor
souls
confined
in
this
place
had
only
a
slight
presentiment
and
vague
idea
of
the
presence
of
jesus
but
the
moment
he
told
them
that
it
was
he
himself
they
burst
out
into
acclamations
of
joy
and
welcomed
him
with
hymns
of
rapture
and
delight
the
soul
of
our
lord
then
wended
its
way
to
the
right
towards
that
part
which
really
constituted
limbo
and
there
he
met
the
soul
of
the
good
thief
which
angels
were
carrying
to
abraham
bosom
as
also
that
of
the
bad
thief
being
dragged
by
demons
into
hell
our
lord
addressed
a
few
words
to
both
and
then
entered
abraham
bosom
accompanied
by
numerous
angels
and
holy
souls
and
also
by
those
demons
who
had
been
chained
and
expelled
from
the
compartment
this
locality
appeared
to
me
more
elevated
than
the
surrounding
parts
and
i
can
only
describe
my
sensations
on
entering
it
by
comparing
them
to
those
of
a
person
coming
suddenly
into
the
interior
of
a
church
after
having
been
for
some
time
in
the
burial
vaults
the
demons
who
were
strongly
chained
were
extremely
loth
to
enter
and
resisted
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
but
the
angels
compelled
them
to
go
forwards
all
the
just
who
had
lived
before
the
time
of
christ
were
assembled
there
the
patriarchs
moses
the
judges
and
the
kings
on
the
side
and
on
the
right
side
the
prophets
and
the
ancestors
of
our
lord
as
also
his
near
relations
such
as
joachim
anna
joseph
zacharias
elizabeth
and
john
there
were
no
demons
in
this
place
and
the
only
discomfort
that
had
been
felt
by
those
placed
there
was
a
longing
desire
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
promise
and
when
our
lord
entered
they
saluted
him
with
joyful
hymns
of
gratitude
and
thanksgiving
for
its
fulfilment
they
prostrated
and
adored
him
and
the
evil
spirits
who
had
been
dragged
into
abraham
bosom
when
our
lord
entered
were
compelled
to
confess
with
shame
that
they
were
vanquished
many
of
these
holy
souls
were
ordered
by
our
lord
to
return
to
the
earth
their
own
bodies
and
thus
render
a
solemn
and
impressive
testimony
to
the
truth
it
was
at
this
moment
that
so
many
dead
persons
left
their
tombs
in
jerusalem
i
regarded
them
less
in
the
light
of
dead
persons
risen
again
than
as
corpses
put
in
motion
by
a
divine
power
and
which
after
having
fulfilled
the
mission
entrusted
to
them
were
laid
aside
in
the
same
manner
as
the
insignia
of
office
are
taken
off
by
a
clerk
when
he
has
executed
the
orders
of
his
superiors
i
next
saw
our
lord
with
his
triumphant
procession
enter
into
a
species
of
purgatory
which
was
filled
with
those
good
pagans
who
having
had
a
faint
glimmering
of
the
truth
had
longed
for
its
fulfilment
this
purgatory
was
very
deep
and
contained
a
few
demons
compelled
to
confess
the
deception
they
had
practised
with
regard
to
these
idols
and
the
souls
of
the
poor
pagans
cast
themselves
at
the
feet
of
jesus
and
adored
him
with
inexpressible
joy
here
likewise
the
demons
were
bound
with
chains
and
dragged
away
i
saw
our
saviour
perform
many
other
actions
but
i
suffered
so
intensely
at
the
same
time
that
i
can
not
recount
them
as
i
should
have
wished
finally
i
beheld
him
approach
to
the
centre
of
the
great
abyss
that
is
to
say
to
hell
itself
and
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
most
severe
the
exterior
of
hell
was
appalling
and
frightful
it
was
an
immense
building
and
the
granite
of
which
it
was
formed
although
black
was
of
metallic
brightness
and
the
dark
and
ponderous
doors
were
secured
with
such
terrible
bolts
that
no
one
could
behold
them
without
trembling
deep
groans
and
cries
of
despair
might
be
plainly
distinguished
even
while
the
doors
were
tightly
closed
but
o
who
can
describe
the
dreadful
yells
and
shrieks
which
burst
upon
the
ear
when
the
bolts
were
unfastened
and
the
doors
flung
open
and
o
who
can
depict
the
melancholy
appearance
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
wretched
place
the
form
under
which
the
heavenly
jerusalem
is
generally
represented
in
my
visions
is
that
of
a
beautiful
and
city
and
the
different
degrees
of
glory
to
which
the
elect
are
raised
are
demonstrated
by
the
magnificence
of
their
palaces
or
the
wonderful
fruit
and
flowers
with
which
the
gardens
are
embellished
hell
is
shown
to
me
under
the
same
form
but
all
within
it
is
on
the
contrary
close
confused
and
crowded
every
object
tends
to
fill
the
mind
with
sensations
of
pain
and
grief
the
marks
of
the
wreath
and
vengeance
of
god
are
visible
everywhere
despair
like
a
vulture
gnaws
every
heart
and
discord
and
misery
reign
around
in
the
heavenly
jerusalem
all
is
peace
and
eternal
harmony
the
beginning
fulfilment
and
end
of
everything
being
pure
and
perfect
happiness
the
city
is
filled
with
splendid
buildings
decorated
in
such
a
manner
as
to
charm
every
eye
and
enrapture
every
sense
the
inhabitants
of
this
delightful
abode
are
overflowing
with
rapture
and
exultation
the
gardens
gay
with
lovely
flowers
and
the
trees
covered
with
delicious
fruits
which
give
eternal
life
in
the
city
of
hell
nothing
is
to
be
seen
but
dismal
dungeons
dark
caverns
frightful
deserts
fetid
swamps
filled
with
every
imaginable
species
of
poisonous
and
disgusting
reptile
in
heaven
you
behold
the
happiness
and
peaceful
union
of
the
saints
in
hell
perpetual
scenes
of
wretched
discord
and
every
species
of
sin
and
corruption
either
under
the
most
horrible
forms
imaginable
or
represented
by
different
kinds
of
dreadful
torments
all
in
this
dreary
abode
tends
to
fill
the
mind
with
horror
not
a
word
of
comfort
is
heard
or
a
consoling
idea
admitted
the
one
tremendous
thought
that
the
justice
of
an
god
inflicts
on
the
damned
nothing
but
what
they
have
fully
deserved
is
the
absorbing
tremendous
conviction
which
weighs
down
each
heart
vice
appears
in
its
own
grim
disgusting
colours
being
stripped
of
the
mask
under
which
it
is
hidden
in
this
world
and
the
infernal
viper
is
seen
devouring
those
who
have
cherished
or
fostered
it
here
below
in
a
word
hell
is
the
temple
of
anguish
and
despair
while
the
kingdom
of
god
is
the
temple
of
peace
and
happiness
this
is
easy
to
understand
when
seen
but
it
is
almost
impossible
to
describe
clearly
the
tremendous
explosion
of
oaths
curses
cries
of
despair
and
frightful
exclamations
which
like
a
clap
of
thunder
burst
forth
when
the
gates
of
hell
were
thrown
open
by
the
angels
would
be
difficult
even
to
imagine
our
lord
spoke
first
to
the
soul
of
judas
and
the
angels
then
compelled
all
the
demons
to
acknowledge
and
adore
jesus
they
would
have
infinitely
preferred
the
most
frightful
torments
to
such
a
humiliation
but
all
were
obliged
to
submit
many
were
chained
down
in
a
circle
which
was
placed
round
other
circles
in
the
centre
of
hell
i
saw
a
dark
and
abyss
and
into
this
lucifer
was
cast
after
being
first
strongly
secured
with
chains
thick
clouds
of
sulphureous
black
smoke
arose
from
its
fearful
depths
and
enveloped
his
frightful
form
in
the
dismal
folds
thus
effectually
concealing
him
from
every
beholder
god
himself
had
decreed
this
and
i
was
likewise
told
if
i
remember
right
that
he
will
be
unchained
for
a
time
fifty
or
sixty
years
before
the
year
of
christ
the
dates
of
many
other
events
were
pointed
out
to
me
which
i
do
not
now
remember
but
a
certain
number
of
demons
are
to
be
let
loose
much
earlier
than
lucifer
in
order
to
tempt
men
and
to
serve
as
instruments
of
the
divine
vengeance
i
should
think
that
some
must
be
loosened
even
in
the
present
day
and
others
will
be
set
free
in
a
short
time
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
me
to
describe
all
the
things
which
were
shown
to
me
their
number
was
so
great
that
i
could
not
reduce
them
sufficiently
to
order
to
define
and
render
them
intelligible
besides
which
my
sufferings
are
very
great
and
when
i
speak
on
the
subject
of
my
visions
i
behold
them
in
my
mind
eye
portrayed
in
such
vivid
colours
that
the
sight
is
almost
sufficient
to
cause
a
weak
mortal
like
myself
to
expire
i
next
saw
innumerable
bands
of
redeemed
souls
liberated
from
purgatory
and
from
limbo
who
followed
our
lord
to
a
delightful
spot
situated
above
the
celestial
jerusalem
in
which
place
i
a
very
short
time
ago
saw
the
soul
of
a
person
who
was
very
dear
to
me
the
soul
of
the
good
thief
was
likewise
taken
there
and
the
promise
of
our
lord
day
thou
shalt
be
with
me
in
paradise
was
fulfilled
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
explain
the
exact
time
that
each
of
these
events
occurred
nor
can
i
relate
of
the
things
which
i
saw
and
heard
for
some
were
incomprehensible
even
to
myself
and
others
would
be
misunderstood
if
i
attempted
to
relate
them
i
have
seen
our
lord
in
many
different
places
even
in
the
sea
he
appeared
to
me
to
sanctify
and
deliver
everything
in
the
creation
evil
spirits
fled
at
his
approach
and
cast
themselves
into
the
dark
abyss
i
likewise
beheld
his
soul
in
different
parts
of
the
earth
first
inside
the
tomb
of
adam
under
golgotha
and
when
he
was
there
the
souls
of
adam
and
eve
came
up
to
him
and
he
spoke
to
them
for
some
time
he
then
visited
the
tombs
of
the
prophets
who
were
buried
at
an
immense
depth
below
the
surface
but
he
passed
through
the
soil
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
their
souls
immediately
their
bodies
and
he
spoke
to
them
and
explained
the
most
wonderful
mysteries
next
i
saw
him
accompanied
by
a
chosen
band
of
prophets
among
whom
i
particularly
remarked
david
visit
those
parts
of
the
earth
which
had
been
sanctified
by
his
miracles
and
by
his
sufferings
he
pointed
out
to
them
with
the
greatest
love
and
goodness
the
different
symbols
in
the
old
law
expressive
of
the
future
and
he
showed
them
how
he
himself
had
fulfilled
every
prophecy
the
sight
of
the
soul
of
our
lord
surrounded
by
these
happy
souls
and
radiant
with
light
was
inexpressibly
grand
as
he
glided
triumphantly
through
the
air
sometimes
passing
with
the
velocity
of
lightning
over
rivers
then
penetrating
though
the
hardest
rocks
to
the
very
centre
of
the
earth
or
moving
noiselessly
over
its
surface
i
can
remember
nothing
beyond
the
facts
which
i
have
just
related
concerning
the
descent
of
jesus
into
limbo
where
he
went
in
order
to
present
to
the
souls
there
detained
the
grace
of
the
redemption
which
he
had
merited
for
them
by
his
death
and
by
his
sufferings
and
i
saw
all
these
things
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
in
fact
time
passed
so
quickly
that
it
seemed
to
me
but
a
moment
our
lord
however
displayed
before
me
at
the
same
time
another
picture
in
which
i
beheld
the
immense
mercies
which
he
bestows
in
the
present
day
on
the
poor
souls
in
purgatory
for
on
every
anniversary
of
this
great
day
when
his
church
is
celebrating
the
glorious
mystery
of
his
death
he
casts
a
look
of
compassion
on
the
souls
in
purgatory
and
frees
some
of
those
who
sinned
against
him
before
his
crucifixion
i
this
day
saw
jesus
deliver
many
souls
some
i
was
acquainted
with
and
others
were
strangers
to
me
but
i
can
not
name
any
of
them
our
lord
by
descending
into
hell
planted
if
i
may
thus
express
myself
in
the
spiritual
garden
of
the
church
a
mysterious
tree
the
fruits
of
which
namely
his
merits
are
destined
for
the
constant
relief
of
the
poor
souls
in
purgatory
the
church
militant
must
cultivate
the
tree
and
gather
its
fruit
in
order
to
present
them
to
that
suffering
portion
of
the
church
which
can
do
nothing
for
itself
thus
it
is
with
all
the
merits
of
christ
we
must
labour
with
him
if
we
wish
to
obtain
our
share
of
them
we
must
gain
our
bread
by
the
sweat
of
our
brow
everything
which
our
lord
has
done
for
us
in
time
must
produce
fruit
for
eternity
but
we
must
gather
these
fruits
in
time
without
which
we
can
not
possess
them
in
eternity
the
church
is
the
most
prudent
and
thoughtful
of
mothers
the
ecclesiastical
year
is
an
immense
and
magnificent
garden
in
which
all
those
fruits
for
eternity
are
gathered
together
that
we
may
make
use
of
them
in
time
each
year
contains
sufficient
to
supply
the
wants
of
all
but
woe
be
to
that
careless
or
dishonest
gardener
who
allows
any
of
the
fruit
committed
to
his
care
to
perish
if
he
fails
to
turn
to
a
proper
account
those
graces
which
would
restore
health
to
the
sick
strength
to
the
weak
or
furnish
food
to
the
hungry
when
the
day
of
judgment
arrives
the
master
of
the
garden
will
demand
a
strict
account
not
only
of
every
tree
but
also
of
all
the
fruit
produced
in
the
garden
chapter
lx
the
eve
of
the
resurrection
towards
the
close
of
the
john
came
to
see
the
holy
women
he
endeavoured
to
give
some
consolation
but
could
not
restrain
his
own
tears
and
only
remained
a
short
time
with
them
they
had
likewise
a
short
visit
from
peter
and
james
the
greater
after
which
they
retired
to
their
cells
and
gave
free
vent
to
grief
sitting
upon
ashes
and
veiling
themselves
even
more
closely
the
prayer
of
the
blessed
virgin
was
unceasing
she
ever
kept
her
eyes
fixed
interiorly
on
jesus
and
was
perfectly
consumed
by
her
ardent
desire
of
once
more
beholding
him
whom
she
loved
with
such
inexpressible
love
suddenly
an
angel
stood
by
her
side
and
bade
her
arise
and
go
to
the
door
of
the
dwelling
of
nicodemus
for
that
the
lord
was
very
near
the
heart
of
the
blessed
virgin
leaped
for
joy
she
hastily
wrapped
her
cloak
about
her
and
left
the
holy
women
without
informing
them
where
she
was
going
i
saw
her
walk
quickly
to
a
small
entrance
which
was
cut
in
the
town
wall
the
identical
one
through
which
she
had
entered
when
returning
with
her
companions
from
the
sepulchre
it
was
about
nine
at
night
and
the
blessed
virgin
had
almost
reached
the
entrance
when
i
saw
her
stop
suddenly
in
a
very
solitary
spot
and
look
upwards
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
for
on
the
top
of
the
town
wall
she
beheld
the
soul
of
our
lord
resplendent
with
light
without
the
appearance
of
a
wound
and
surrounded
by
patriarchs
he
descended
towards
her
turned
to
his
companions
and
presenting
her
to
them
said
mary
behold
my
mother
he
appeared
to
me
to
salute
her
with
a
kiss
and
he
then
disappeared
the
blessed
virgin
knelt
down
and
most
reverently
kissed
the
ground
on
which
he
had
stood
and
the
impression
of
her
hands
and
knees
remained
imprinted
upon
the
stones
the
sight
filled
her
with
inexpressible
joy
and
she
immediately
rejoined
the
holy
women
who
were
busily
employed
in
preparing
the
perfumes
and
spices
she
did
not
tell
them
what
she
had
seen
but
her
firmness
and
strength
of
mind
was
restored
she
was
perfectly
renovated
and
therefore
comforted
all
the
rest
and
endeavoured
to
strengthen
their
faith
all
the
holy
women
were
sitting
by
a
long
table
the
cover
of
which
hung
down
to
the
floor
when
mary
returned
bundles
of
herbs
were
heaped
around
them
and
these
they
mixed
together
and
arranged
small
flasks
containing
sweet
unctions
and
water
of
spikenard
were
standing
near
as
also
bunches
of
natural
flowers
among
which
i
remarked
one
in
particular
which
was
like
a
streaked
iris
or
a
lily
magdalen
mary
the
daughter
of
cleophas
salome
johanna
and
mary
salome
had
bought
all
these
things
in
the
town
during
the
absence
of
mary
their
intention
was
to
go
to
the
sepulchre
before
sunrise
on
the
following
day
in
order
to
strew
these
flowers
and
perfumes
over
the
body
of

chapter
lvi
joseph
of
arimathea
miraculously
set
at
large
a
short
time
after
the
return
of
the
blessed
virgin
to
the
holy
women
i
was
shown
the
interior
of
the
prison
in
which
the
enemies
of
joseph
of
arimathea
had
confined
him
he
was
praying
fervently
when
suddenly
a
brilliant
light
illuminated
the
whole
place
and
i
heard
a
voice
calling
him
by
name
while
at
the
same
moment
the
roof
opened
and
a
bright
form
appeared
holding
out
a
sheet
resembling
that
in
which
he
had
wrapped
the
body
of
jesus
joseph
grasped
it
with
both
hands
and
was
drawn
up
to
the
opening
which
closed
again
as
soon
as
he
had
passed
through
and
the
apparition
disappeared
the
instant
he
was
in
safety
at
the
tope
of
the
tower
i
know
not
whether
it
was
our
lord
himself
or
an
angel
who
thus
set
joseph
free
he
walked
on
the
summit
of
the
wall
until
he
reached
the
neighbourhood
of
the
cenaculum
which
was
near
to
the
south
wall
of
sion
and
then
climbed
down
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
that
edifice
as
the
doors
were
fastened
the
disciples
assembled
there
had
been
much
grieved
when
they
first
missed
joseph
who
they
thought
had
been
thrown
into
a
sink
a
report
to
that
effect
having
become
current
great
therefore
was
their
joy
when
they
opened
the
door
and
found
that
it
was
he
himself
indeed
they
were
almost
as
much
delighted
as
when
peter
was
miraculously
delivered
from
prison
some
years
after
when
joseph
had
related
what
had
taken
place
they
were
filled
with
astonishment
and
delight
and
after
thanking
god
fervently
gave
him
some
refreshment
which
he
greatly
needed
he
left
jerusalem
that
same
night
and
fled
to
arimathea
his
native
place
where
he
remained
until
he
thought
he
could
return
safely
to
jerusalem
i
likewise
saw
caiphas
towards
the
close
of
the
at
the
house
of
nicodemus
he
was
conversing
with
him
and
asking
many
questions
with
pretended
kindness
nicodemus
answered
firmly
and
continued
to
affirm
the
innocence
of
jesus
they
did
not
remain
long
together
chapter
lxii
the
night
of
resurrection
i
soon
after
beheld
the
tomb
of
our
lord
all
was
calm
and
silent
around
it
there
were
six
soldiers
on
guard
who
were
either
seated
or
standing
before
the
door
and
cassius
was
among
them
his
appearance
was
that
of
a
person
immersed
in
meditation
and
in
the
expectation
of
some
great
event
the
sacred
body
of
our
blessed
redeemer
was
wrapped
in
the
and
surrounded
with
light
while
two
angels
sat
in
an
attitude
of
adoration
the
one
at
the
head
and
the
other
at
the
feet
i
had
seen
them
in
the
same
posture
ever
since
he
was
first
put
into
the
tomb
these
angels
were
clothed
as
priests
their
position
and
the
manner
in
which
they
crossed
their
arms
over
their
breasts
reminded
me
of
the
cherubim
who
surrounded
the
ark
of
the
covenant
only
they
were
without
wings
at
least
i
did
not
see
any
the
whole
of
the
sepulchre
reminded
me
of
the
ark
of
the
covenant
at
different
periods
of
its
history
it
is
possible
that
cassius
was
sensible
of
the
presence
of
the
angels
and
of
the
bright
light
which
filled
the
sepulchre
for
his
attitude
was
like
that
of
a
person
in
deep
contemplation
before
the
blessed
sacrament
i
next
saw
the
soul
of
our
lord
accompanied
by
those
among
the
patriarchs
whom
he
had
liberated
enter
into
the
tomb
through
the
rock
he
showed
them
the
wounds
with
which
his
sacred
body
was
covered
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
which
previously
enveloped
it
was
removed
and
that
jesus
wished
to
show
the
souls
the
excess
of
suffering
he
had
endured
to
redeem
them
the
body
appeared
to
me
to
be
quite
transparent
so
that
the
whole
depth
of
the
wounds
could
be
seen
and
this
sight
filled
the
holy
souls
with
admiration
although
deep
feelings
of
compassion
likewise
drew
tears
from
their
eyes
my
next
vision
was
so
mysterious
that
i
can
not
explain
or
even
relate
it
in
a
clear
manner
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
soul
and
body
of
jesus
were
taken
together
out
of
the
sepulchre
without
however
the
former
being
completely
reunited
to
the
latter
which
still
remained
inanimate
i
thought
i
saw
two
angels
who
were
kneeling
and
adoring
at
the
head
and
feet
of
the
sacred
body
raise
it
keeping
it
in
the
exact
position
in
which
it
was
lying
in
the
tomb
and
carry
it
uncovered
and
disfigured
with
wounds
across
the
rock
which
trembled
as
they
passed
it
then
appeared
to
me
that
jesus
presented
his
body
marked
with
the
stigmas
of
the
passion
to
his
heavenly
father
who
seated
on
a
throne
was
surrounded
by
innumerable
choirs
of
angels
blissfully
occupied
in
pouring
forth
hymns
of
adoration
and
jubilee
the
case
was
probably
the
same
when
at
the
death
of
our
lord
so
many
holy
souls
their
bodies
and
appeared
in
the
temple
and
in
different
parts
of
jerusalem
for
it
is
not
likely
that
the
bodies
which
they
animated
were
really
alive
as
in
that
case
they
would
have
been
obliged
to
die
a
second
time
whereas
they
returned
to
their
original
state
without
apparent
difficulty
but
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
their
appearance
in
human
form
was
similar
to
that
of
our
lord
when
he
if
we
may
thus
express
it
accompanied
his
body
to
the
throne
of
his
heavenly
father
at
this
moment
the
rock
was
so
violently
shaken
from
the
very
summit
to
the
base
that
three
of
the
guards
fell
down
and
became
almost
insensible
the
other
four
were
away
at
the
time
being
gone
to
the
town
to
fetch
something
the
guards
who
were
thus
thrown
prostrate
attributed
the
sudden
shock
to
an
earthquake
but
cassius
who
although
uncertain
as
to
what
all
this
might
portend
yet
felt
an
inward
presentiment
that
it
was
the
prelude
to
some
stupendous
event
stood
transfixed
in
anxious
expectation
waiting
to
see
what
would
follow
next
the
soldiers
who
were
gone
to
jerusalem
soon
returned
i
again
beheld
the
holy
women
they
had
finished
preparing
the
spices
and
were
resting
in
their
private
cells
not
stretched
out
on
the
couches
but
leaning
against
the
bedclothes
which
were
rolled
up
they
wished
to
go
to
the
sepulchre
before
the
break
of
day
because
they
feared
meeting
the
enemies
of
jesus
but
the
blessed
virgin
who
was
perfectly
renovated
and
filled
with
fresh
courage
since
she
had
seen
her
son
consoled
and
recommended
them
to
sleep
for
a
time
and
then
go
fearlessly
to
the
tomb
as
no
harm
would
come
to
them
whereupon
they
immediately
followed
her
advice
and
endeavoured
to
sleep
it
was
towards
eleven
at
night
when
the
blessed
virgin
incited
by
irrepressible
feelings
of
love
arose
wrapped
a
grey
cloak
around
her
and
left
the
house
quite
alone
when
i
saw
her
do
this
i
could
not
help
feeling
anxious
and
saying
to
myself
is
it
possible
for
this
holy
mother
who
is
so
exhausted
from
anguish
and
terror
to
venture
to
walk
all
alone
through
the
streets
at
such
an
hour
i
saw
her
go
first
to
the
house
of
caiphas
and
then
to
the
palace
of
pilate
which
was
at
a
great
distance
off
i
watched
her
through
the
whole
of
her
solitary
journey
along
that
part
which
had
been
trodden
by
her
son
loaded
with
his
heavy
cross
she
stopped
at
every
place
where
our
saviour
had
suffered
particularly
or
had
received
any
fresh
outrage
from
his
barbarous
enemies
her
appearance
as
she
walked
slowly
along
was
that
of
a
person
seeking
something
she
often
bent
down
to
the
ground
touched
the
stones
with
her
hands
and
then
inundated
them
with
kisses
if
the
precious
blood
of
her
beloved
son
was
upon
them
god
granted
her
at
this
time
particular
lights
and
graces
and
she
was
able
without
the
slightest
degree
of
difficulty
to
distinguish
every
place
sanctified
by
his
sufferings
i
accompanied
her
through
the
whole
of
her
pious
pilgrimage
and
i
endeavoured
to
imitate
her
to
the
best
of
my
power
as
far
as
my
weakness
would
permit
mary
then
went
to
calvary
but
when
she
had
almost
reached
it
she
stopped
suddenly
and
i
saw
the
sacred
body
and
soul
of
our
saviour
standing
before
her
an
angel
walked
in
front
the
two
angels
whom
i
had
seen
in
the
tomb
were
by
his
side
and
the
souls
whom
he
had
redeemed
followed
him
by
hundreds
the
body
of
jesus
was
brilliant
and
beautiful
but
its
appearance
was
not
that
of
a
living
body
although
a
voice
issued
from
it
and
i
heard
him
describe
to
the
blessed
virgin
all
he
had
done
in
limbo
and
then
assure
her
that
he
should
rise
again
with
his
glorified
body
that
he
would
then
show
himself
to
her
and
that
she
must
wait
near
the
rock
of
mount
calvary
and
that
part
where
she
saw
him
fall
down
until
he
appeared
our
saviour
then
went
towards
jerusalem
and
the
blessed
virgin
having
again
wrapped
her
veil
about
her
prostrated
on
the
spot
which
he
had
pointed
out
it
was
then
i
think
past
midnight
for
the
pilgrimage
of
mary
over
the
way
of
the
cross
had
taken
up
at
least
an
hour
and
i
next
saw
the
holy
souls
who
had
been
redeemed
by
our
saviour
traverse
in
their
turn
the
sorrowful
way
of
the
cross
and
contemplate
the
different
places
where
he
had
endured
such
fearful
sufferings
for
their
sakes
the
angels
who
accompanied
them
gathered
sacred
flesh
which
had
been
torn
off
by
the
frequent
blows
he
received
as
also
the
blood
with
which
the
ground
was
sprinkled
on
those
spots
where
he
had
fallen
i
once
more
saw
the
sacred
body
of
our
lord
stretched
out
as
i
first
beheld
it
in
the
sepulchre
the
angels
were
occupied
in
replacing
the
garments
they
had
gathered
up
of
his
flesh
and
they
received
supernatural
assistance
in
doing
this
when
next
i
contemplated
him
it
was
in
his
surrounded
with
a
bright
light
and
with
two
adoring
angels
by
his
side
i
can
not
explain
how
all
these
things
came
to
pass
for
they
are
far
beyond
our
human
comprehension
and
even
if
i
understand
them
perfectly
myself
when
i
see
them
they
appear
dark
and
mysterious
when
i
endeavour
to
explain
them
to
others
as
soon
as
a
faint
glimmering
of
dawn
appeared
in
the
east
i
saw
magdalen
mary
the
daughter
of
cleophas
johanna
chusa
and
salome
leave
the
cenaculum
closely
wrapped
up
in
their
mantles
they
carried
bundles
of
spices
and
one
of
their
number
had
a
lighted
candle
in
her
hand
which
she
endeavoured
to
conceal
under
her
cloak
i
saw
them
direct
their
trembling
steps
towards
the
small
door
at
the
house
of
nicodemus
chapter
lxiii
the
resurrection
of
our
lord
i
beheld
the
soul
of
our
lord
between
two
angels
who
were
in
the
attire
of
warriors
it
was
bright
luminous
and
resplendent
as
the
sun
at
it
penetrated
the
rock
touched
the
sacred
body
passed
into
it
and
the
two
were
instantaneously
united
and
became
as
one
i
then
saw
the
limbs
move
and
the
body
of
our
lord
being
reunited
to
his
soul
and
to
his
divinity
rise
and
shake
off
the
the
whole
of
the
cave
was
illuminated
and
lightsome
at
the
same
moment
i
saw
a
frightful
monster
burst
from
the
earth
underneath
the
sepulchre
it
had
the
tail
of
a
serpent
and
it
raised
its
dragon
head
proudly
as
if
desirous
of
attacking
jesus
and
had
likewise
if
i
remember
correctly
a
human
head
but
our
lord
held
in
his
hand
a
white
staff
to
which
was
appended
a
large
banner
and
he
placed
his
foot
on
the
head
of
the
dragon
and
struck
its
tail
three
times
with
his
staff
after
which
the
monster
disappeared
i
had
had
this
same
vision
many
times
before
the
resurrection
and
i
saw
just
such
a
monster
appearing
to
endeavour
to
hide
itself
at
the
time
of
the
conception
of
our
lord
it
greatly
resembled
the
serpent
which
tempted
our
first
parents
in
paradise
only
it
was
more
horrible
i
thought
that
this
vision
had
reference
to
the
prophetic
words
that
the
seed
of
the
woman
the
head
of
the
serpent
should
be
crushed
and
that
the
whole
was
intended
to
demonstrate
the
victory
of
our
lord
over
death
for
at
the
same
moment
that
i
saw
him
crush
the
head
of
the
monster
the
tomb
likewise
vanished
from
my
sight
i
then
saw
the
glorified
body
of
our
lord
rise
up
and
it
passed
through
the
hard
rock
as
easily
as
if
the
latter
had
been
formed
of
some
ductile
substance
the
earth
shook
and
an
angel
in
the
garb
of
a
warrior
descended
from
heaven
with
the
speed
of
lightning
entered
the
tomb
lifted
the
stone
placed
it
on
the
right
side
and
seated
himself
upon
it
at
this
tremendous
sight
the
soldiers
fell
to
the
ground
and
remained
there
apparently
lifeless
when
cassius
saw
the
bright
light
which
illuminated
the
tomb
he
approached
the
place
where
the
sacred
body
had
been
placed
looked
at
and
touched
the
linen
clothes
in
which
it
had
been
wrapped
and
left
the
sepulchre
intending
to
go
and
inform
pilate
of
all
that
had
happened
however
he
tarried
a
short
time
to
watch
the
progress
of
events
for
although
he
had
felt
the
earthquake
seen
the
angel
move
the
stone
and
looked
at
the
empty
tomb
yet
he
had
not
seen
jesus
at
the
very
moment
in
which
the
angel
entered
the
sepulchre
and
the
earth
quaked
i
saw
our
lord
appear
to
his
holy
mother
on
calvary
his
body
was
beautiful
and
lightsome
and
its
beauty
was
that
of
a
celestial
being
he
was
clothed
in
a
large
mantle
which
at
one
moment
looked
dazzlingly
white
as
it
floated
through
the
air
waving
to
and
fro
with
every
breath
of
wind
and
the
next
reflected
a
thousand
brilliant
colours
as
the
sunbeams
passed
over
it
his
large
open
wounds
shone
brightly
and
could
be
seen
from
a
great
distance
the
wounds
in
his
hands
were
so
large
that
a
finger
might
be
put
into
them
without
difficulty
and
rays
of
light
proceeded
from
them
diverging
in
the
direction
of
his
fingers
the
souls
of
the
patriarchs
bowed
down
before
the
mother
of
our
saviour
and
jesus
spoke
to
her
concerning
his
resurrection
telling
her
many
things
which
i
have
forgotten
he
showed
her
his
wounds
and
mary
prostrated
to
kiss
his
sacred
feet
but
he
took
her
hand
raised
her
and
disappeared
when
i
was
at
some
distance
from
the
sepulchre
i
saw
fresh
lights
burning
there
and
i
likewise
beheld
a
large
luminous
spot
in
the
sky
immediately
over
jerusalem
chapter
lxiv
the
holy
women
at
the
sepulchre
the
holy
women
were
very
near
the
door
of
nicodemus
house
at
the
moment
of
our
lord
resurrection
but
they
did
not
see
anything
of
the
prodigies
which
were
taking
place
at
the
sepulchre
they
were
not
aware
that
guards
had
been
placed
around
the
tomb
for
they
had
not
visited
it
on
the
previous
day
on
account
of
its
being
the
sabbath
they
questioned
one
another
anxiously
concerning
what
would
have
to
be
done
about
the
large
stone
at
the
door
as
to
who
would
be
the
best
person
to
ask
about
removing
it
for
they
had
been
so
engrossed
by
grief
that
they
had
not
thought
about
it
before
their
intention
was
to
pour
precious
ointments
upon
the
body
of
jesus
and
then
to
strew
over
it
flowers
of
the
most
rare
and
aromatic
kinds
thus
rendering
all
the
honour
possible
to
their
divine
master
in
his
sepulchre
salome
who
had
brought
more
things
than
anyone
else
was
a
rich
lady
who
lived
in
jerusalem
a
relation
of
joseph
but
not
the
mother
of
john
the
holy
women
came
to
the
determination
of
putting
down
their
spices
on
the
stone
which
closed
the
door
of
the
monument
and
waiting
until
someone
came
to
roll
it
back
the
guards
were
still
lying
on
the
ground
and
the
strong
convulsions
which
even
then
shook
them
clearly
demonstrated
how
great
had
been
their
terror
and
the
large
stone
was
cast
on
one
side
so
that
the
door
could
be
opened
without
difficulty
i
could
see
the
linen
cloth
in
which
the
body
of
jesus
had
been
wrapped
scattered
about
in
the
tomb
and
the
large
lying
in
the
same
place
as
when
they
left
it
but
doubled
together
in
such
a
manner
that
you
saw
at
once
that
it
no
longer
contained
anything
but
the
spices
which
had
been
placed
round
the
body
and
the
bandages
were
on
the
outside
of
the
tomb
the
linen
cloth
in
which
mary
had
enveloped
the
sacred
head
of
her
son
was
still
there
i
saw
the
holy
women
coming
into
the
garden
but
when
they
perceived
the
light
given
by
the
lamps
of
the
sentinels
and
the
prostrate
forms
of
the
soldiers
round
the
tomb
they
for
the
most
part
became
much
alarmed
and
retreated
towards
golgotha
mary
magdalen
was
however
more
courageous
and
followed
by
salome
entered
the
garden
while
the
other
women
remained
timidly
on
the
outside
magdalen
started
and
appeared
for
a
moment
terrified
when
she
drew
near
the
sentinels
she
retreated
a
few
steps
and
rejoined
salome
but
both
quickly
recovered
their
presence
of
mind
and
walked
on
together
through
the
midst
of
the
prostrate
guards
and
entered
into
the
cave
which
contained
the
sepulchre
they
immediately
perceived
that
the
stone
was
removed
but
the
doors
were
closed
which
had
been
done
in
all
probability
by
cassius
magdalen
opened
them
quickly
looked
anxiously
into
the
sepulchre
and
was
much
surprised
at
seeing
that
the
cloths
in
which
they
had
enveloped
our
lord
were
lying
on
one
side
and
that
the
place
where
they
had
deposited
the
sacred
remains
was
empty
a
celestial
light
filled
the
cave
and
an
angel
was
seated
on
the
right
side
magdalen
became
almost
beside
herself
from
disappointment
and
alarm
i
do
not
know
whether
she
heard
the
words
which
the
angel
addressed
to
her
but
she
left
the
garden
as
quickly
as
possible
and
ran
to
the
town
to
inform
the
apostles
who
were
assembled
there
of
what
had
taken
place
i
do
not
know
whether
the
angel
spoke
to
mary
salome
as
she
did
not
enter
the
sepulchre
but
i
saw
her
leaving
the
garden
directly
after
magdalen
in
order
to
relate
all
that
had
happened
to
the
rest
of
the
holy
women
who
were
both
frightened
and
delighted
at
the
news
but
could
not
make
up
their
minds
as
to
whether
they
would
go
to
the
garden
or
not
in
the
mean
time
cassius
had
remained
near
the
sepulchre
in
hopes
of
seeing
jesus
as
he
thought
he
would
be
certain
to
appear
to
the
holy
women
but
seeing
nothing
he
directed
his
steps
towards
pilate
palace
to
relate
to
him
all
that
had
happened
stopping
however
first
at
the
place
where
the
rest
of
the
holy
women
were
assembled
to
tell
them
what
he
had
seen
and
to
exhort
them
to
go
immediately
to
the
garden
they
followed
his
advice
and
went
there
at
once
no
sooner
had
they
reached
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
than
they
beheld
two
angels
clothed
in
sacerdotal
vestments
of
the
most
dazzling
white
the
women
were
very
much
alarmed
covered
their
faces
with
their
hands
and
prostrated
almost
to
the
ground
but
one
of
the
angels
addressed
them
bade
them
not
fear
and
told
them
that
they
must
not
seek
for
their
crucified
lord
there
for
that
he
was
alive
had
risen
and
was
no
longer
an
inhabitant
of
the
tomb
he
pointed
out
to
them
at
the
same
moment
the
empty
sepulchre
and
ordered
them
to
go
and
relate
to
the
disciples
all
that
they
had
seen
and
heard
he
likewise
told
them
that
jesus
would
go
before
them
into
galilee
and
recalled
to
their
minds
the
words
which
our
saviour
had
addressed
to
them
on
a
former
occasion
son
of
man
will
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
sinners
he
will
be
crucified
and
the
third
day
rise
again
the
angels
then
disappeared
and
left
the
holy
women
filled
with
joy
although
of
course
greatly
agitated
they
wept
looked
at
the
empty
tomb
and
linen
clothes
and
immediately
started
to
return
to
the
town
but
they
were
so
much
overcome
by
the
many
astounding
events
which
had
taken
place
that
they
walked
very
slowly
and
stopped
and
looked
back
often
in
hopes
of
seeing
our
lord
or
at
least
magdalen
in
the
mean
time
magdalen
reached
the
cenaculum
she
was
so
excited
as
to
appear
like
a
person
beside
herself
and
knocked
hastily
at
the
door
some
of
the
disciples
were
still
sleeping
and
those
who
were
risen
were
conversing
together
peter
and
john
opened
the
door
but
she
only
exclaimed
without
entering
the
house
have
taken
away
the
body
of
my
lord
and
i
know
not
where
they
have
laid
him
and
immediately
returned
to
the
garden
peter
and
john
went
back
into
the
house
and
after
saying
a
few
words
to
the
other
disciples
followed
her
as
speedily
as
possible
but
john
far
outstripped
peter
i
then
saw
magdalen
reenter
the
garden
and
direct
her
steps
towards
the
sepulchre
she
appeared
greatly
agitated
partly
from
grief
and
partly
from
having
walked
so
fast
her
garments
were
quite
moist
with
dew
and
her
veil
hanging
on
one
side
while
the
luxuriant
hair
in
which
she
had
formerly
taken
so
much
pride
fell
in
dishevelled
masses
over
her
shoulders
forming
a
species
of
mantle
being
alone
she
was
afraid
of
entering
the
cave
but
stopped
for
a
moment
on
the
outside
and
knelt
down
in
order
to
see
better
into
the
tomb
she
was
endeavouring
to
push
back
her
long
hair
which
fell
over
her
face
and
obscured
her
vision
when
she
perceived
the
two
angels
who
were
seated
in
the
tomb
and
i
heard
one
of
them
address
her
thus
why
weepest
thou
she
replied
in
a
voice
choked
with
tears
for
she
was
perfectly
overwhelmed
with
grief
at
finding
that
the
body
of
jesus
was
really
gone
they
have
taken
away
my
lord
and
i
know
not
where
they
have
laid
him
she
said
no
more
but
seeing
the
empty
went
out
of
the
sepulchre
and
began
to
look
about
in
other
parts
she
felt
a
secret
presentiment
that
not
only
should
she
find
jesus
but
that
he
was
even
then
near
to
her
and
the
presence
of
the
angels
seemed
not
to
disturb
her
in
the
least
she
did
not
appear
even
to
be
aware
that
they
were
angels
every
faculty
was
engrossed
with
the
one
thought
is
not
here
where
is
jesus
i
watched
her
wandering
about
like
an
insane
person
with
her
hair
floating
loosely
in
the
wind
her
hair
appeared
to
annoy
her
much
for
she
again
endeavoured
to
push
it
from
off
her
face
and
having
divided
it
into
two
parts
threw
it
over
her
shoulders
she
then
raised
her
head
looked
around
and
perceived
a
tall
figure
clothed
in
white
standing
at
about
ten
paces
from
the
sepulchre
on
the
east
side
of
the
garden
where
there
was
a
slight
rise
in
the
direction
of
the
town
the
figure
was
partly
hidden
from
her
sight
by
a
but
she
was
somewhat
startled
when
it
addressed
her
in
these
words
why
weepest
thou
whom
seekest
thou
she
thought
it
was
the
gardener
and
in
fact
he
had
a
spade
in
his
hand
and
a
large
hat
apparently
made
of
the
bark
of
trees
on
his
head
his
dress
was
similar
to
that
worn
by
the
gardener
described
in
the
parable
which
jesus
had
related
to
the
holy
women
at
bethania
a
short
time
before
his
passion
his
body
was
not
luminous
his
hole
appearance
was
rather
that
of
a
man
dressed
in
white
and
seen
by
twilight
at
the
words
seekest
thou
she
looked
at
him
and
answered
quickly
if
thou
hast
taken
him
hence
tell
me
where
thou
hast
laid
him
and
i
will
take
him
away
and
she
looked
anxiously
around
jesus
said
to
her
she
then
instantly
recognised
his
beloved
voice
and
turning
quickly
replied
master
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
before
him
and
stretched
out
her
hands
to
touch
his
feet
but
he
motioned
her
to
be
still
and
said
not
touch
me
for
i
am
not
yet
ascended
to
my
father
but
go
to
my
brethren
and
say
to
them
i
ascend
to
my
father
and
to
your
father
to
my
god
and
your
god
he
then
disappeared
the
reason
of
the
words
of
jesus
not
touch
me
was
afterwards
explained
to
me
but
i
have
only
an
indistinct
remembrance
of
that
explanation
i
think
he
made
use
of
those
words
because
of
the
impetuosity
of
magdalen
feelings
which
made
her
in
a
certain
degree
forget
the
stupendous
mystery
which
had
been
accomplished
and
feel
as
if
what
she
then
beheld
was
still
mortal
instead
of
a
glorified
body
as
for
the
words
of
jesus
am
not
yet
ascended
to
my
father
i
was
told
that
their
meaning
was
that
he
had
not
presented
himself
to
his
father
since
his
resurrection
to
return
him
thanks
for
his
victory
over
death
and
for
the
work
of
the
redemption
which
he
had
accomplished
he
wished
her
to
infer
from
these
words
that
the
of
joy
belong
to
god
and
that
she
ought
to
reflect
and
return
thanks
to
him
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
glorious
mystery
of
the
redemption
and
for
the
victory
which
he
had
gained
over
death
and
if
she
had
kissed
his
feet
as
she
used
before
the
passion
she
would
have
thought
of
nothing
but
her
divine
master
and
in
her
raptures
of
love
have
totally
forgotten
the
wonderful
events
which
were
causing
such
astonishment
and
joy
in
heaven
i
saw
magdalen
arise
quickly
as
soon
as
our
lord
disappeared
and
run
to
look
again
in
the
sepulchre
as
if
she
believed
herself
under
the
influence
of
a
dream
she
saw
the
two
angels
still
seated
there
and
they
spoke
to
her
concerning
the
resurrection
of
our
lord
in
the
same
words
as
they
had
addressed
the
two
other
women
she
likewise
saw
the
empty
and
then
feeling
certain
that
she
was
not
in
a
state
of
delusion
but
that
the
apparition
of
our
lord
was
real
she
walked
quickly
back
towards
golgotha
to
seek
her
companions
who
were
wandering
about
to
and
fro
anxiously
looking
out
for
her
return
and
indulging
a
kind
of
vague
hope
that
they
should
see
or
hear
something
of
jesus
the
whole
of
this
scene
occupied
a
little
more
than
two
or
three
minutes
it
was
about
three
when
our
lord
appeared
to
magdalen
and
john
and
peter
entered
the
garden
just
as
she
was
leaving
it
john
who
was
a
little
in
advance
of
peter
stopped
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
and
looked
in
he
saw
the
linen
clothes
lying
on
one
side
and
waited
until
peter
came
up
when
they
entered
the
sepulchre
together
and
saw
the
empty
as
has
been
before
described
john
instantly
believed
in
the
resurrection
and
they
both
understood
clearly
the
words
addressed
to
them
by
jesus
before
his
passion
as
well
as
the
different
passages
in
scripture
relating
to
that
event
which
had
until
then
been
incomprehensible
to
them
peter
put
the
linen
clothes
under
his
cloak
and
they
returned
hastily
into
the
town
through
the
small
entrance
belonging
to
nicodemus
the
appearance
of
the
holy
sepulchre
was
the
same
when
the
two
apostles
entered
as
when
magdalen
first
saw
it
the
two
adoring
angels
were
seated
one
at
the
head
and
the
other
at
the
extremity
of
the
tomb
in
precisely
the
same
attitude
as
when
his
adorable
body
was
lying
there
i
do
not
think
peter
was
conscious
of
their
presence
i
afterwards
heard
john
tell
the
disciples
of
emmaus
that
when
he
looked
into
the
sepulchre
he
saw
an
angel
perhaps
he
was
startled
by
this
sight
and
therefore
drew
back
and
let
peter
enter
the
sepulchre
first
but
it
is
likewise
very
possible
that
the
reason
of
his
not
mentioning
the
circumstance
in
his
gospel
was
because
humility
made
him
anxious
to
conceal
the
fact
of
his
having
been
more
highly
favoured
than
peter
the
guards
at
this
moment
began
to
revive
and
rising
gathered
up
their
lances
and
took
down
the
lamps
which
were
on
the
door
from
whence
they
cast
a
glimmering
weak
light
on
surrounding
objects
i
then
saw
them
walk
hastily
out
of
the
garden
in
evident
fear
and
trepidation
in
the
direction
of
the
town
in
the
mean
time
magdalen
had
rejoined
the
holy
women
and
given
them
the
account
of
her
seeing
the
lord
in
the
garden
and
of
the
words
of
the
angels
afterwards
whereupon
they
immediately
related
what
had
been
seen
by
themselves
and
magdalen
wended
her
way
quickly
to
jerusalem
while
the
women
returned
to
that
side
of
the
garden
where
they
expected
to
find
the
two
apostles
just
before
they
reached
it
jesus
appeared
to
them
he
was
clothed
in
a
long
white
robe
which
concealed
even
his
hands
and
said
to
them
hail
they
started
with
astonishment
and
cast
themselves
at
his
feet
he
spoke
a
few
words
held
forth
his
hand
as
if
to
point
out
something
to
them
and
disappeared
the
holy
women
went
instantly
to
the
cenaculum
and
told
the
disciples
who
were
assembled
there
that
they
had
seen
the
lord
the
disciples
were
incredulous
and
would
not
give
credence
either
to
their
account
or
to
that
of
magdalen
they
treated
both
the
one
and
the
other
as
the
effects
of
their
excited
imaginations
but
when
peter
and
john
entered
the
room
and
related
what
they
likewise
had
seen
they
knew
not
what
to
answer
and
were
filled
with
astonishment
peter
and
john
soon
left
the
cenaculum
as
the
wonderful
events
which
had
taken
place
rendered
them
extremely
silent
and
thoughtful
and
before
long
they
met
james
the
less
and
thaddeus
who
had
wished
to
accompany
them
to
the
sepulchre
both
james
and
thaddeus
were
greatly
overcome
for
the
lord
had
appeared
to
them
a
short
time
before
they
met
peter
and
john
i
also
saw
jesus
pass
quite
close
to
peter
and
john
i
think
the
former
recognised
him
for
the
started
suddenly
but
i
do
not
think
the
latter
saw
him
chapter
lxv
the
relation
which
was
given
by
the
sentinels
who
were
placed
around
the
sepulchre
cassius
hastened
to
the
house
of
pilate
about
an
hour
after
the
resurrection
in
order
to
give
him
an
account
of
the
stupendous
events
which
had
taken
place
he
was
not
yet
risen
but
cassius
was
allowed
to
enter
his
bedroom
he
related
all
that
had
happened
and
expressed
his
feelings
in
the
most
forcible
language
he
described
how
the
rock
had
been
rent
and
how
an
angel
had
descended
from
heaven
and
pushed
aside
the
stone
he
also
spoke
of
the
empty
and
added
that
most
certainly
jesus
was
the
messiah
the
son
of
god
and
that
he
was
truly
risen
pilate
listened
to
this
account
he
trembled
and
quivered
with
terror
but
concealed
his
agitation
to
the
best
of
his
power
and
answered
cassius
in
these
words
art
exceedingly
superstitious
it
was
very
foolish
to
go
to
the
galilean
tomb
his
gods
took
advantage
of
thy
weakness
and
displayed
all
these
ridiculous
visions
to
alarm
thee
i
recommend
thee
to
keep
silence
and
not
recount
such
silly
tales
to
the
priests
for
thou
wouldst
get
the
worst
of
it
from
them
he
pretended
to
believe
that
the
body
of
jesus
had
been
carried
away
by
his
disciples
and
that
the
sentinels
who
had
been
bribed
and
had
fallen
asleep
or
perhaps
been
deceived
by
witchcraft
had
fabricated
these
accounts
in
order
to
justify
their
conduct
when
pilate
had
said
all
he
could
on
the
subject
cassius
left
him
and
he
went
to
offer
sacrifice
to
his
gods
the
four
soldiers
who
had
guarded
the
tomb
arrived
shortly
after
at
pilate
palace
and
began
to
tell
him
all
that
he
had
already
heard
from
cassius
but
he
would
listen
to
nothing
more
and
sent
them
to
caiphas
the
rest
of
the
guards
were
assembled
in
a
large
court
near
the
temple
which
was
filled
with
aged
jews
who
after
some
previous
consultation
took
the
soldiers
on
one
side
and
by
dint
of
bribes
and
threats
endeavoured
to
persuade
them
to
say
that
they
fell
asleep
and
that
while
they
were
asleep
the
disciples
came
and
carried
away
the
body
of
our
lord
the
soldiers
however
demurred
because
the
statement
which
their
comrades
were
gone
to
make
to
pilate
would
contradict
any
account
which
they
could
now
fabricate
but
the
pharisees
promised
to
arrange
everything
with
the
governor
whilst
they
were
still
disputing
the
four
guards
returned
from
their
interview
with
pilate
and
the
pharisees
endeavoured
to
persuade
them
to
conceal
the
truth
but
this
they
refused
to
do
and
declared
firmly
that
they
would
not
vary
their
first
statement
in
the
smallest
degree
the
miraculous
deliverance
of
joseph
of
arimathea
from
prison
was
become
public
and
when
the
pharisees
accused
the
soldiers
of
having
allowed
the
apostles
to
carry
off
the
body
of
jesus
and
threatened
them
with
the
infliction
of
the
most
severe
punishment
if
they
did
not
produce
the
body
they
replied
that
it
would
be
as
utterly
impossible
for
them
to
produce
the
body
of
jesus
as
it
was
for
the
soldiers
who
had
charge
of
joseph
of
arimathea
to
bring
him
back
into
his
prison
again
they
spoke
with
the
greatest
firmness
and
courage
promises
and
menaces
were
equally
ineffectual
they
declared
that
they
would
speak
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
that
the
sentence
of
death
which
had
been
passed
upon
jesus
was
both
unjust
and
iniquitous
and
that
the
crime
which
was
perpetrated
in
putting
him
to
death
was
the
sole
cause
of
the
interruption
in
the
paschal
solemnity
the
pharisees
being
perfectly
furious
caused
the
four
soldiers
to
be
arrested
and
thrown
into
prison
and
the
others
who
had
accepted
the
bribes
they
offered
then
affirmed
that
the
body
of
jesus
had
been
carried
off
by
the
disciples
while
they
slept
and
the
pharisees
sadducees
and
herodians
endeavoured
to
disseminate
this
lie
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
not
only
in
the
synagogue
but
also
among
the
people
and
they
accompanied
this
false
statement
by
the
most
slanderous
lies
concerning
jesus
all
these
precautions
however
availed
but
little
for
after
the
resurrection
many
persons
who
had
been
long
dead
arose
from
their
graves
and
appeared
to
those
among
their
descendants
who
were
not
sufficiently
hardened
to
be
impervious
to
grace
and
exhorted
them
to
be
converted
these
dead
persons
were
likewise
seen
by
many
of
the
disciples
who
overcome
with
terror
and
shaken
in
faith
had
fled
into
the
country
they
both
exhorted
and
encouraged
them
to
return
and
restored
their
drooping
courage
the
resurrection
of
these
dead
persons
did
not
in
the
slightest
degree
resemble
the
resurrection
of
jesus
he
arose
with
a
glorified
body
which
was
no
longer
susceptible
of
either
corruption
or
death
and
ascended
into
heaven
with
this
glorified
body
in
the
sight
of
all
his
disciples
but
the
dead
bodies
of
which
we
spoke
above
were
motionless
corpses
and
the
souls
which
once
inhabited
them
were
only
allowed
to
enter
and
reanimate
them
for
a
time
and
after
performing
the
mission
given
them
the
souls
again
quitted
these
bodies
which
returned
to
their
original
state
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
where
they
will
remain
until
the
resurrection
at
the
day
of
judgment
neither
could
their
return
to
life
be
compared
to
the
raising
of
lazarus
from
the
dead
for
he
really
returned
to
a
new
life
and
died
a
second
time
chapter
lxvi
the
end
of
the
lenten
meditations
on
the
following
sunday
if
i
remember
right
i
saw
the
jews
washing
and
purifying
the
they
offered
up
expiatory
sacrifices
cleared
away
the
rubbish
and
endeavoured
to
conceal
the
effects
of
the
earthquake
by
placing
planks
and
carpets
over
the
chasms
and
fissures
made
by
it
in
the
walls
and
on
the
pavement
and
they
recommenced
the
paschal
solemnities
which
had
been
interrupted
in
the
midst
declared
that
the
disturbance
had
been
caused
by
the
presence
of
impure
persons
and
endeavoured
to
explain
away
the
apparition
of
the
dead
they
referred
to
a
vision
of
ezechiel
but
how
i
can
no
longer
remember
they
threatened
all
who
dared
to
say
a
syllable
concerning
the
events
which
had
taken
place
or
who
presumed
to
murmur
with
excommunication
and
other
severe
punishments
they
succeeded
in
silencing
some
few
hardened
persons
who
conscious
of
their
own
guilt
wished
to
banish
the
subject
from
their
minds
but
they
made
no
impression
on
those
whose
hearts
still
retained
some
remains
of
virtue
they
remained
silent
for
a
time
concealing
their
inward
belief
but
later
regaining
courage
proclaimed
their
faith
in
jesus
loudly
to
the
world
the
high
priests
were
much
disconcerted
when
they
perceived
how
rapidly
the
doctrines
of
christ
spread
over
the
country
when
stephen
was
deacon
the
whole
of
ophel
and
the
eastern
side
of
sion
was
too
small
to
contain
the
numerous
christian
communities
and
a
portion
were
obliged
to
take
up
their
residence
in
the
country
between
jerusalem
and
bethania
i
saw
annas
in
such
a
state
of
frenzy
as
to
act
like
one
possessed
he
was
at
last
obliged
to
be
confined
and
never
again
to
make
his
appearance
in
public
caiphas
was
outwardly
less
demonstrative
but
he
was
inwardly
devoured
with
such
rage
and
extreme
jealousy
that
his
reason
was
affected
i
saw
pilate
on
easter
thursday
he
was
instituting
a
search
for
his
wife
in
every
part
of
the
city
but
his
efforts
for
her
recovery
were
fruitless
she
was
concealed
in
the
house
of
lazarus
in
jerusalem
no
one
thought
of
looking
there
as
the
house
contained
no
other
female
but
stephen
carried
food
to
her
there
and
let
her
know
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
city
stephen
was
to
paul
they
were
the
sons
of
two
brothers
on
the
day
after
the
sabbath
simon
of
cyrene
went
to
the
apostles
and
begged
to
be
instructed
and
to
receive
baptism
the
visions
of
sister
emmerich
which
had
continued
from
the
of
february
to
the
of
april
here
came
to
a
conclusion
appendix
detached
account
of
longinus
on
the
of
march
sister
emmerich
gave
the
following
detached
account
of
parts
of
a
vision
which
she
had
had
the
previous
night
concerning
longinus
whose
festival
happened
to
fall
upon
that
very
day
although
she
did
not
know
it
longinus
who
had
i
think
another
name
held
on
office
partly
civil
and
partly
military
in
the
household
of
pilate
who
entrusted
him
with
the
duty
of
superintending
all
that
passed
and
making
a
report
of
it
to
him
he
was
trustworthy
and
ready
to
do
a
service
but
previous
to
his
conversion
was
greatly
wanting
in
firmness
and
strength
of
character
he
was
excessively
impetuous
in
all
that
he
did
and
anxious
to
be
thought
a
person
of
great
importance
and
as
he
squinted
and
had
weak
eyes
he
was
often
jeered
at
and
made
the
of
his
companions
i
have
seen
him
frequently
during
the
course
of
this
night
and
in
connection
with
him
i
have
at
the
same
time
seen
all
the
passion
i
do
not
know
in
what
manner
i
only
remember
that
it
was
in
connection
with
him
longinus
was
only
in
a
subordinate
position
and
had
to
give
an
account
to
pilate
of
all
that
he
saw
on
the
night
that
jesus
was
led
before
the
tribunal
of
caiphas
he
was
in
the
outer
court
among
the
soldiers
and
unceasingly
going
backwards
and
forwards
when
peter
was
alarmed
at
the
words
of
the
standing
near
the
fire
it
was
he
who
said
once
thou
not
also
one
of
this
man
disciples
when
jesus
was
being
led
to
calvary
longinus
by
pilate
orders
followed
him
closely
and
our
divine
lord
gave
him
a
look
which
touched
his
heart
afterwards
i
saw
him
on
golgotha
with
the
soldiers
he
was
on
horseback
and
carried
a
lance
i
saw
him
at
pilate
house
after
the
death
of
our
lord
saying
that
the
legs
of
jesus
ought
not
to
be
broken
he
returned
at
once
to
calvary
his
lance
was
made
of
several
pieces
which
fitted
one
into
the
other
so
that
by
drawing
them
out
the
lance
could
be
made
three
times
its
original
length
he
had
just
done
this
when
he
came
to
the
sudden
determination
of
piercing
the
side
of
our
saviour
he
was
converted
upon
mount
calvary
and
a
short
time
afterwards
expressed
to
pilate
his
conviction
that
jesus
was
the
son
of
god
nicodemus
prevailed
upon
pilate
to
let
him
have
longinus
lance
and
i
have
seen
many
things
concerning
the
subsequent
history
of
this
lance
longinus
after
his
conversion
left
the
army
and
joined
the
disciples
he
and
two
other
soldiers
who
were
converted
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
were
among
the
first
baptised
after
pentecost
i
saw
longinus
and
these
two
men
clothed
in
long
white
garments
return
to
their
native
land
they
lived
there
in
the
country
in
a
barren
and
marshy
locality
here
it
was
that
the
forty
martyrs
died
longinus
was
not
a
priest
but
a
deacon
and
travelled
here
and
there
in
that
capacity
preaching
the
name
of
christ
and
giving
as
an
a
history
of
his
passion
and
resurrection
he
converted
a
large
number
of
persons
and
cured
many
of
the
sick
by
allowing
them
to
touch
a
piece
of
the
sacred
lance
which
he
carried
with
him
the
jews
were
much
enraged
at
him
and
his
two
companions
because
they
made
known
in
all
parts
the
truth
of
the
resurrection
of
jesus
and
the
cruelty
and
deceits
of
his
enemies
at
their
instigation
some
roman
soldiers
were
dispatched
to
longinus
country
to
take
and
judge
him
on
the
plea
of
his
having
left
the
army
without
leave
and
being
a
disturber
of
public
peace
he
was
engaged
in
cultivating
his
field
when
they
arrived
and
he
took
them
to
his
house
and
offered
them
hospitality
they
did
not
know
him
and
when
they
had
acquainted
him
with
the
object
of
their
journey
he
quietly
called
his
two
companions
who
were
living
in
a
sort
of
hermitage
at
no
great
distance
off
and
told
the
soldiers
that
they
and
himself
were
the
men
for
whom
they
were
seeking
the
same
thing
happened
to
the
holy
gardener
phocas
the
soldiers
were
really
distressed
for
they
had
conceived
a
great
friendship
for
him
i
saw
him
led
with
his
two
companions
to
a
small
neighbouring
town
where
they
were
questioned
they
were
not
put
in
prison
but
permitted
to
go
whither
they
pleased
as
prisoners
on
their
word
and
only
made
to
wear
a
distinctive
park
on
the
shoulder
later
they
were
all
three
beheaded
on
a
hill
situated
between
the
little
town
and
longinus
house
and
there
buried
the
soldiers
put
the
head
of
longinus
at
the
end
of
a
spear
and
carried
it
to
jerusalem
as
a
proof
that
they
had
fulfilled
their
commission
i
think
i
remember
that
this
took
place
a
very
few
years
after
the
death
of
our
lord
afterwards
i
had
a
vision
of
things
happening
at
a
later
period
a
blind
countrywoman
of
longinus
went
with
her
son
on
a
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
in
hopes
of
recovering
her
sight
in
the
holy
city
where
the
eyes
of
longinus
had
been
cured
she
was
guided
by
her
child
but
he
died
and
she
was
left
alone
and
disconsolate
then
longinus
appeared
to
her
and
told
her
that
she
would
recover
her
sight
when
she
had
drawn
his
head
out
of
a
sink
into
which
the
jews
had
thrown
it
this
sink
was
a
deep
well
with
the
sides
bricked
and
all
the
filth
and
refuse
of
the
town
flowed
into
it
through
several
drains
i
saw
some
persons
lead
the
poor
woman
to
the
spot
she
descended
into
the
well
up
to
her
neck
and
drew
out
the
sacred
head
whereupon
she
recovered
her
sight
she
returned
to
her
native
land
and
her
companions
preserved
the
head
i
remember
no
more
upon
this
subject
detached
account
of
abenadar
on
the
of
april
sister
emmerich
said
that
that
day
was
the
feast
of
ctesiphon
the
centurion
who
had
assisted
at
the
crucifixion
and
that
she
had
seen
during
the
night
various
particulars
concerning
his
life
but
she
had
also
suffered
greatly
which
combined
with
exterior
distractions
had
caused
her
to
forget
the
greatest
part
of
what
she
had
seen
she
related
what
follows
abenadar
afterwards
called
ctesiphon
was
born
in
a
country
situated
between
babylon
and
egypt
in
arabia
felix
to
the
right
of
the
spot
where
job
dwelt
during
the
latter
half
of
his
life
a
certain
number
of
square
houses
with
flat
roofs
were
built
there
on
a
slight
ascent
there
were
many
small
trees
growing
on
this
spot
and
incense
and
balm
were
gathered
there
i
have
been
in
abenadar
house
which
was
large
and
spacious
as
might
be
expected
of
a
rich
man
house
but
it
was
also
very
low
all
these
houses
were
built
in
this
manner
perhaps
on
account
of
the
wind
because
they
were
much
exposed
abenadar
had
joined
the
garrison
of
the
fortress
antonia
at
jerusalem
as
a
volunteer
he
had
entered
the
roman
service
for
the
purpose
of
enjoying
more
facilities
in
his
study
of
the
fine
arts
for
he
was
a
learned
man
his
character
was
firm
his
figure
short
and
and
his
complexion
dark
abenadar
was
early
convinced
by
the
doctrine
which
he
heard
jesus
preach
and
by
a
miracle
which
he
saw
him
work
that
salvation
was
to
be
found
among
the
jews
and
he
had
submitted
to
the
law
of
moses
although
not
yet
a
disciple
of
our
lord
he
bore
him
no
illwill
and
held
his
person
in
secret
veneration
he
was
naturally
grave
and
composed
and
when
he
came
to
golgotha
to
relieve
guard
he
kept
order
on
all
sides
and
forced
everybody
to
behave
at
least
with
common
decency
down
to
the
moment
when
truth
triumphed
over
him
and
he
rendered
public
testimony
to
the
divinity
of
jesus
being
a
rich
man
and
a
volunteer
he
had
no
difficulty
in
resigning
his
post
at
once
he
assisted
at
the
descent
from
the
cross
and
the
burial
of
our
lord
which
put
him
into
familiar
connection
with
the
friends
of
jesus
and
after
the
day
of
pentecost
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
receive
baptism
in
the
pool
of
bethsaida
where
he
took
the
name
of
ctesiphon
he
had
a
brother
living
in
arabia
to
whom
he
related
the
miracles
he
had
beheld
and
who
was
thus
called
to
the
path
of
salvation
came
to
jerusalem
was
baptised
by
the
name
of
cecilius
and
was
charged
together
with
ctesiphon
to
assist
the
deacons
in
the
christian
community
ctesiphon
accompanied
the
apostle
james
the
greater
into
spain
and
also
returned
with
him
after
a
time
he
was
again
sent
into
spain
by
the
apostles
and
carried
there
the
body
of
james
who
had
been
martyred
at
jerusalem
he
was
made
a
bishop
and
resided
chiefly
in
a
sort
of
island
or
peninsula
at
no
great
distance
from
france
which
he
also
visited
and
where
he
made
some
disciples
the
name
of
the
place
where
he
lived
was
rather
like
vergui
and
it
was
afterwards
laid
waste
by
an
inundation
i
do
not
remember
that
ctesiphon
was
ever
martyred
he
wrote
several
books
containing
details
concerning
the
passion
of
christ
but
there
have
been
some
books
falsely
attributed
to
him
and
others
which
were
really
from
his
pen
ascribed
to
different
writers
rome
has
since
rejected
these
books
the
greatest
part
of
which
were
apocryphal
but
which
nevertheless
did
contain
some
few
things
really
from
his
pen
one
of
the
guards
of
our
lord
sepulchre
who
would
not
let
himself
be
bribed
by
the
jews
was
his
fellow
countryman
and
friend
his
name
was
something
like
sulei
or
suleii
after
being
detained
some
time
in
prison
he
retired
into
a
cavern
of
mount
sinai
where
he
lived
seven
years
god
bestowed
many
special
graces
upon
this
man
and
he
wrote
some
very
learned
books
in
the
style
of
denis
the
areopagite
another
writer
made
use
of
his
works
and
in
this
manner
some
extracts
from
them
have
come
down
to
us
everything
concerning
these
facts
was
made
known
to
me
as
well
as
the
name
of
the
book
but
i
have
forgotten
it
this
countryman
of
ctesiphon
afterwards
followed
him
into
spain
among
the
companions
of
ctesiphon
in
that
country
were
this
brother
cecilius
and
some
other
men
whose
name
were
intalecius
hesicius
and
euphrasius
another
arab
called
sulima
was
converted
in
the
very
early
days
of
the
church
and
a
fellow
countryman
of
ctesiphon
with
a
name
like
sulensis
became
a
christian
later
in
the
time
of
the
deacons
the
end
anne
catherine
visions
clearly
fall
in
the
category
of
private
revelation
sacred
scripture
and
sacred
tradition
are
infallible
private
revelation
is
fallible
however
her
visions
are
neither
mere
human
meditations
nor
pious
fiction
her
account
of
events
in
the
lives
of
jesus
and
mary
were
revealed
to
her
by
god
although
god
can
not
err
in
anything
he
does
errors
can
be
introduced
into
private
revelation
by
a
misunderstanding
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
receives
the
revelation
or
by
an
error
made
by
the
person
who
writes
down
or
transmits
the
revelation
sacred
scripture
and
sacred
tradition
are
immune
from
these
types
of
error
private
revelation
is
not
anne
catherine
visions
come
from
god
but
they
are
fallible
because
they
come
to
us
through
fallible
human
persons
her

in

her

anne

emmerich
details
the
events
of
the
ministry
of
jesus
christ
although
she
explicitly
states
that
christ
ministry
lasted
years
vol
the
astute
reader
of
that
work
will
notice
a
gap
of
about
one
year
she
here
again
explained
the
manner
in
which
the
families
assembled
together
and
in
what
numbers
but
the
writer
has
forgotten
her
words
she
was
not
certain
that
the
blessed
sacrament
was
administered
in
that
order
for
on
another
occasion
she
had
seen
john
the
last
to
receive
it
was
not
without
surprise
that
the
editor
some
years
after
these
things
had
been
related
by
sister
emmerich
read
in
the
latin
edition
of
the
roman
catechism
mayence
muller
in
reference
to
the
sacrament
of
confirmation
that
according
to
the
tradition
of
the
holy
pope
fabian
jesus
taught
his
apostles
in
what
manner
they
were
to
prepare
the
holy
chrism
after
the
institution
of
the
blessed
sacrament
the
pope
says
expressly
in
the
paragraph
of
his
second
epistle
to
the
bishops
of
the
east
predecessors
received
from
the
apostles
and
delivered
to
us
that
our
saviour
jesus
christ
after
having
made
the
last
supper
with
his
apostles
and
washed
their
feet
taught
them
how
to
prepare
the
holy
chrism
on
the
of
december
in
her
visions
of
the
public
life
of
jesus
she
saw
our
lord
permit
the
devils
whom
he
had
expelled
from
the
men
of
gergesa
to
enter
into
a
herd
of
swine
she
also
saw
on
this
particular
occasion
that
the
possessed
men
first
overturned
a
large
vat
filled
with
some
fermented
liquid
dulmen
is
a
small
town
in
westphalia
where
sister
emmerich
lived
at
this
time
mary
of
heli
is
often
spoken
of
in
this
relation
according
to
sister
emmerich
she
was
the
daughter
of
joachim
and
anne
and
was
born
nearly
twenty
years
before
the
blessed
virgin
she
was
not
the
child
of
promise
and
is
called
mary
of
heli
by
which
she
is
distinguished
from
the
other
of
the
same
name
because
she
was
the
daughter
of
joachim
or
heliachim
her
husband
bore
the
name
of
cleophas
and
her
daughter
that
of
mary
of
cleophas
this
daughter
was
however
older
than
her
aunt
the
blessed
virgin
and
had
been
married
first
to
alpheus
by
whom
she
had
three
sons
afterwards
the
apostles
simon
james
the
less
and
thaddeus
she
had
one
son
by
her
second
husband
sabat
and
another
called
simon
by
her
third
husband
jonas
simon
was
afterwards
bishop
of
jerusalem
these
meditations
on
the
sufferings
of
jesus
filled
sister
emmerich
with
such
feelings
of
compassion
that
she
begged
of
god
to
allow
her
to
suffer
as
he
had
done
she
instantly
became
feverish
and
parched
with
thirst
and
by
morning
was
speechless
from
the
contraction
of
her
tongue
and
of
her
lips
she
was
in
this
state
when
her
friend
came
to
her
in
the
morning
and
she
looked
like
a
victim
which
had
just
been
sacrificed
those
around
succeeded
with
some
difficulty
in
moistening
her
mouth
with
a
little
water
but
it
was
long
before
she
could
give
any
further
details
concerning
her
meditations
on
the
passion
the
zacharias
here
referred
to
was
the
father
of
john
the
baptist
who
was
tortured
and
afterwards
put
to
death
by
herod
because
he
would
not
betray
john
into
the
hands
of
the
tyrant
he
was
buried
by
his
friends
within
the
precincts
of
the
temple
sister
emmerich
added
was
baptised
by
the
name
of
longinus
and
was
ordained
deacon
and
preached
the
faith
he
always
kept
some
of
the
blood
of
christ
it
dried
up
but
was
found
in
his
coffin
in
italy
he
was
buried
in
a
town
at
no
great
distance
from
the
locality
where
clare
passed
her
life
there
is
a
lake
with
an
island
upon
it
near
this
town
and
the
body
of
longinus
must
have
been
taken
there
sister
emmerich
appears
to
designate
mantua
by
this
description
and
there
is
a
tradition
preserved
in
that
town
to
the
effect
i
do
not
know
which
clare
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
we
must
here
remark
that
in
the
four
years
during
which
sister
emmerich
had
her
visions
she
described
everything
that
had
happened
to
the
holy
places
from
the
earliest
times
down
to
our
own
more
than
once
she
beheld
them
profaned
and
laid
waste
but
always
venerated
either
publicly
or
privately
she
saw
many
stones
and
pieces
of
rock
which
had
been
silent
witnesses
of
the
passion
and
resurrection
of
our
lord
placed
by
helena
in
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
upon
occasion
of
the
foundation
of
that
sacred
building
when
sister
emmerich
visited
it
in
spirit
she
was
accustomed
to
venerate
the
spots
where
the
cross
had
stood
and
the
holy
sepulchre
been
situated
it
must
be
observed
however
that
she
used
sometimes
to
see
a
greater
distance
between
the
actual
position
of
the
tomb
and
the
spot
where
the
cross
stood
than
there
is
between
the
chapels
which
bear
their
names
in
the
church
at
jerusalem
on
good
friday
march
as
sister
emmerich
was
contemplating
the
descent
from
the
cross
she
suddenly
fainted
in
the
presence
of
the
writer
of
these
lines
and
appeared
to
be
really
dead
but
after
a
time
she
recovered
her
senses
and
gave
the
following
explanation
although
still
in
a
state
of
great
suffering
i
was
contemplating
the
body
of
jesus
lying
on
the
knees
of
the
blessed
virgin
i
said
to
myself
how
great
is
her
strength
she
has
not
fainted
even
once
my
guide
reproached
me
for
this
thought
in
which
there
was
more
astonishment
than
compassion
and
said
to
me
suffer
then
what
she
has
suffered
and
at
the
same
moment
a
sensation
of
the
sharpest
anguish
transfixed
me
like
a
sword
so
that
i
believed
i
must
have
died
from
it
she
had
had
an
illness
which
reduced
her
almost
to
the
brink
of
the
grave
sister
emmerich
said
that
the
shape
of
these
pincers
reminded
her
of
the
scissors
with
which
samson
hair
was
cut
off
in
her
visions
of
the
third
year
of
the
public
life
of
jesus
she
had
seen
our
lord
keep
the
sabbathday
at
misael
a
town
belonging
to
the
levites
of
the
tribe
of
aser
and
as
a
portion
of
the
book
of
judges
was
read
in
the
synagogue
sister
emmerich
beheld
upon
that
occasion
the
life
of
samson
sister
emmerich
was
accustomed
when
speaking
of
persons
of
historical
importance
to
explain
how
they
divided
their
hair
she
said
her
hair
in
two
parts
but
mary
into
three
and
she
appeared
to
attach
importance
to
these
words
no
opportunity
presented
itself
for
her
to
give
any
explanation
upon
the
subject
which
probably
would
have
shown
what
was
done
with
the
hair
in
sacrifices
funerals
consecrations
or
vows
etc
she
once
said
of
samson
fair
hair
which
was
long
and
thick
was
gathered
up
on
his
head
in
seven
tresses
like
a
helmet
and
the
ends
of
these
tresses
were
fastened
upon
his
forehead
and
temples
his
hair
was
not
in
itself
the
source
of
his
strength
but
only
as
the
witness
to
the
vow
which
he
had
made
to
let
it
grow
in
god
honour
the
powers
which
depended
upon
these
seven
tresses
were
the
seven
gifts
of
the
holy
ghost
he
must
have
already
broken
his
vows
and
lost
many
graces
when
he
allowed
this
sign
of
being
a
nazarene
to
be
cut
off
i
did
not
see
dalila
cut
off
all
his
hair
and
i
think
one
lock
remained
on
his
forehead
he
retained
the
grace
to
do
penance
and
of
that
repentance
by
which
he
recovered
strength
sufficient
to
destroy
his
enemies
the
life
of
samson
is
figurative
and
prophetic
this
refers
to
a
custom
of
the
diocese
of
munster
during
lent
there
was
hung
up
in
the
churches
a
curtain
embroidered
in
open
work
representing
the
five
wounds
the
instruments
of
the
passion
etc
apparently
sister
emmerich
here
spoke
of
the
ancient
cases
in
which
her
poor
countrymen
keep
their
clothes
the
lower
part
of
these
cases
is
smaller
than
the
upper
and
this
gives
them
some
likeness
to
a
tomb
she
had
one
of
these
cases
which
she
called
her
chest
she
often
described
the
stone
by
this
comparison
but
her
descriptions
have
not
nevertheless
given
us
a
very
clear
idea
of
its
shape
the
above
relation
was
given
later
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
whether
it
relates
to
the
day
of
the
resurrection
or
to
the
following
sunday
