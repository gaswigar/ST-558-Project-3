monsieur
de
guise
latin
on
monday
the
of
august
there
was
a
splendid
festival
at
the
louvre
the
ordinarily
gloomy
windows
of
the
ancient
royal
residence
were
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
squares
and
streets
adjacent
usually
so
solitary
after
saint
germain
had
struck
the
hour
of
nine
were
crowded
with
people
although
it
was
past
midnight
the
vast
threatening
eager
turbulent
throng
resembled
in
the
darkness
a
black
and
tumbling
sea
each
billow
of
which
makes
a
roaring
breaker
this
sea
flowing
through
the
rue
des
fossés
saint
germain
and
the
rue
de
and
covering
the
quay
surged
against
the
base
of
the
walls
of
the
louvre
and
in
its
refluent
tide
against
the
hôtel
de
bourbon
which
faced
it
on
the
other
side
in
spite
of
the
royal
festival
and
perhaps
even
because
of
the
royal
festival
there
was
something
threatening
in
the
appearance
of
the
people
for
no
doubt
was
felt
that
this
imposing
ceremony
which
called
them
there
as
spectators
was
only
the
prelude
to
another
in
which
they
would
participate
a
week
later
as
invited
guests
and
amuse
themselves
with
all
their
hearts
the
court
was
celebrating
the
marriage
of
madame
marguerite
de
valois
daughter
of
henry
ii
and
sister
of
king
charles
with
henry
de
bourbon
king
of
navarre
in
truth
that
very
morning
on
a
stage
erected
at
the
entrance
to
the
cardinal
de
bourbon
had
united
the
young
couple
with
the
usual
ceremonial
observed
at
the
marriages
of
the
royal
daughters
of
france
this
marriage
had
astonished
every
one
and
occasioned
much
surmise
to
certain
persons
who
saw
clearer
than
others
they
found
it
difficult
to
understand
the
union
of
two
parties
who
hated
each
other
so
thoroughly
as
did
at
this
moment
the
protestant
party
and
the
catholic
party
and
they
wondered
how
the
young
prince
de
condé
could
forgive
the
duc
the
king
brother
for
the
death
of
his
father
assassinated
at
jarnac
by
montesquiou
they
asked
how
the
young
duc
de
guise
could
pardon
admiral
de
coligny
for
the
death
of
his
father
assassinated
at
orléans
by
poltrot
de
méré
moreover
jeanne
de
navarre
the
weak
antoine
de
bourbon
courageous
wife
who
had
conducted
her
son
henry
to
the
royal
marriage
awaiting
him
had
died
scarcely
two
months
before
and
singular
reports
had
been
spread
abroad
as
to
her
sudden
death
it
was
everywhere
whispered
and
in
some
places
said
aloud
that
she
had
discovered
some
terrible
secret
and
that
catharine
de
médicis
fearing
its
disclosure
had
poisoned
her
with
perfumed
gloves
which
had
been
made
by
a
man
named
réné
a
florentine
deeply
skilled
in
such
matters
this
report
was
the
more
widely
spread
and
believed
when
after
this
great
queen
death
at
her
son
request
two
celebrated
physicians
one
of
whom
was
the
famous
ambroise
paré
were
instructed
to
open
and
examine
the
body
but
not
the
skull
as
jeanne
de
navarre
had
been
poisoned
by
a
perfume
only
the
brain
could
show
any
trace
of
the
crime
the
one
part
excluded
from
dissection
we
say
crime
for
no
one
doubted
that
a
crime
had
been
committed
this
was
not
all
king
charles
in
particular
had
with
a
persistency
almost
approaching
obstinacy
urged
this
marriage
which
not
only
reëstablished
peace
in
his
kingdom
but
also
attracted
to
paris
the
principal
huguenots
of
france
as
the
two
betrothed
belonged
one
to
the
catholic
religion
and
the
other
to
the
reformed
religion
they
had
been
obliged
to
obtain
a
dispensation
from
gregory
who
then
filled
the
papal
chair
the
dispensation
was
slow
in
coming
and
the
delay
had
caused
the
late
queen
of
navarre
great
uneasiness
she
one
day
expressed
to
charles
ix
her
fears
lest
the
dispensation
should
not
arrive
to
which
the
king
replied
have
no
anxiety
my
dear
aunt
i
honor
you
more
than
i
do
the
pope
and
i
love
my
sister
more
than
i
fear
him
i
am
not
a
huguenot
neither
am
i
a
blockhead
and
if
the
pope
makes
a
fool
of
himself
i
will
myself
take
margot
by
the
hand
and
have
her
married
to
your
son
in
some
protestant
this
speech
was
soon
spread
from
the
louvre
through
the
city
and
while
it
greatly
rejoiced
the
huguenots
had
given
the
catholics
something
to
think
about
they
asked
one
another
in
a
whisper
if
the
king
was
really
betraying
them
or
was
only
playing
a
comedy
which
some
fine
morning
or
evening
might
have
an
unexpected
ending
charles
ix
conduct
toward
admiral
de
coligny
who
for
five
or
six
years
had
been
so
bitterly
opposed
to
the
king
appeared
particularly
inexplicable
after
having
put
on
his
head
a
price
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
golden
crowns
the
king
now
swore
by
him
called
him
his
father
and
declared
openly
that
he
should
in
future
confide
the
conduct
of
the
war
to
him
alone
to
such
a
pitch
was
this
carried
that
catharine
de
médicis
herself
who
until
then
had
controlled
the
young
actions
will
and
even
desires
seemed
to
be
growing
really
uneasy
and
not
without
reason
for
in
a
moment
of
confidence
charles
ix
had
said
to
the
admiral
in
reference
to
the
war
in
flanders
my
father
there
is
one
other
thing
against
which
we
must
be
on
our
guard
that
is
that
the
queen
my
mother
who
likes
to
poke
her
nose
everywhere
as
you
well
know
shall
learn
nothing
of
this
undertaking
we
must
keep
it
so
quiet
that
she
will
not
have
a
suspicion
of
it
or
being
such
a
as
i
know
she
is
she
would
spoil
all
now
wise
and
experienced
as
he
was
coligny
had
not
been
able
to
keep
such
an
absolute
secret
and
though
he
had
come
to
paris
with
great
suspicions
and
albeit
at
his
departure
from
chatillon
a
peasant
woman
had
thrown
herself
at
his
feet
crying
ah
sir
our
good
master
do
not
go
to
paris
for
if
you
do
you
will
die
you
and
all
who
are
with
you
these
suspicions
were
gradually
lulled
in
his
heart
and
so
it
was
with
téligny
his
to
whom
the
king
was
especially
kind
and
attentive
calling
him
his
brother
as
he
called
the
admiral
his
father
and
addressing
him
with
the
familiar
thou
as
he
did
his
best
friends
the
huguenots
excepting
some
few
morose
and
suspicious
spirits
were
therefore
completely
reassured
the
death
of
the
queen
of
navarre
passed
as
having
been
caused
by
pleurisy
and
the
spacious
apartments
of
the
louvre
were
filled
with
all
those
gallant
protestants
to
whom
the
marriage
of
their
young
chief
henry
promised
an
unexpected
return
of
good
fortune
admiral
coligny
la
rochefoucault
the
young
prince
de
condé
téligny
in
short
all
the
leaders
of
the
party
were
triumphant
when
they
saw
so
powerful
at
the
louvre
and
so
welcome
in
paris
those
whom
three
months
before
king
charles
and
queen
catharine
would
have
hanged
on
gibbets
higher
than
those
of
assassins
the
maréchal
de
montmorency
was
the
only
one
who
was
missing
among
all
his
brothers
for
no
promise
could
move
him
no
specious
appearances
deceive
him
and
he
remained
secluded
in
his
château
de
adam
offering
as
his
excuse
for
not
appearing
the
grief
which
he
still
felt
for
his
father
the
constable
anne
de
montmorency
who
had
been
killed
at
the
battle
of
saint
denis
by
a
fired
by
robert
stuart
but
as
this
had
taken
place
more
than
three
years
before
and
as
sensitiveness
was
a
virtue
little
practised
at
that
time
this
unduly
protracted
mourning
was
interpreted
just
as
people
cared
to
interpret
it
however
everything
seemed
to
show
that
the
maréchal
de
montmorency
was
mistaken
the
king
the
queen
the
duc
and
the
duc
did
the
honors
of
the
royal
festival
with
all
courtesy
and
kindness
the
duc
received
from
the
huguenots
themselves
compliments
on
the
two
battles
of
jarnac
and
montcontour
which
he
had
gained
before
he
was
eighteen
years
of
age
more
precocious
in
that
than
either
cæsar
or
alexander
to
whom
they
compared
him
of
course
placing
the
conquerors
of
pharsalia
and
the
issus
as
inferior
to
the
living
prince
the
duc
looked
on
with
his
bland
false
smile
while
queen
catharine
radiant
with
joy
and
overflowing
with
honeyed
phrases
congratulated
prince
henry
de
condé
on
his
recent
marriage
with
marie
de
clèves
even
the
messieurs
de
guise
themselves
smiled
on
the
formidable
enemies
of
their
house
and
the
duc
de
mayenne
discoursed
with
de
tavannes
and
the
admiral
on
the
impending
war
which
was
now
more
than
ever
threatened
against
philippe
ii
in
the
midst
of
these
groups
a
young
man
of
about
nineteen
years
of
age
was
walking
to
and
fro
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
his
ear
open
to
all
that
was
said
he
had
a
keen
eye
black
hair
cut
very
close
thick
eyebrows
a
nose
hooked
like
an
eagle
a
sneering
smile
and
a
growing
mustache
and
beard
this
young
man
who
by
his
reckless
daring
had
first
attracted
attention
at
the
battle
of
and
was
the
recipient
of
numberless
compliments
was
the
dearly
beloved
pupil
of
coligny
and
the
hero
of
the
day
three
months
before
that
is
to
say
when
his
mother
was
still
living
he
was
called
the
prince
de
béarn
now
he
was
called
the
king
of
navarre
afterwards
he
was
known
as
henry
iv
from
time
to
time
a
swift
and
gloomy
cloud
passed
over
his
brow
unquestionably
it
was
at
the
thought
that
scarce
had
two
months
elapsed
since
his
mother
death
and
he
less
than
any
one
doubted
that
she
had
been
poisoned
but
the
cloud
was
transitory
and
disappeared
like
a
fleeting
shadow
for
they
who
spoke
to
him
they
who
congratulated
him
they
who
elbowed
him
were
the
very
ones
who
had
assassinated
the
brave
jeanne
some
paces
distant
from
the
king
of
navarre
almost
as
pensive
almost
as
gloomy
as
the
king
pretended
to
be
joyous
and
was
the
young
duc
de
guise
conversing
with
téligny
more
fortunate
than
the
béarnais
at
he
had
almost
attained
the
reputation
of
his
father
françois
the
great
duc
de
guise
he
was
an
elegant
gentleman
very
tall
with
a
noble
and
haughty
look
and
gifted
with
that
natural
majesty
which
caused
it
to
be
said
that
in
comparison
with
him
other
princes
seemed
to
belong
to
the
people
young
as
he
was
the
catholics
looked
up
to
him
as
the
chief
of
their
party
as
the
huguenots
saw
theirs
in
henry
of
navarre
whose
portrait
we
have
just
drawn
at
first
he
had
borne
the
title
of
prince
de
joinville
and
at
the
siege
of
orléans
had
fought
his
first
battle
under
his
father
who
died
in
his
arms
denouncing
admiral
coligny
as
his
assassin
the
young
duke
then
like
hannibal
took
a
solemn
oath
to
avenge
his
father
death
on
the
admiral
and
his
family
and
to
pursue
the
foes
to
his
religion
without
truce
or
respite
promising
god
to
be
his
destroying
angel
on
earth
until
the
last
heretic
should
be
exterminated
so
with
deep
astonishment
the
people
saw
this
prince
usually
so
faithful
to
his
word
offering
his
hand
to
those
whom
he
had
sworn
to
hold
as
his
eternal
enemies
and
talking
familiarly
with
the
of
the
man
whose
death
he
had
promised
to
his
dying
father
but
as
we
have
said
this
was
an
evening
of
astonishments
indeed
an
observer
privileged
to
be
present
at
this
festival
endowed
with
the
knowledge
of
the
future
which
is
fortunately
hidden
from
men
and
with
that
power
of
reading
men
hearts
which
unfortunately
belongs
only
to
god
would
have
certainly
enjoyed
the
strangest
spectacle
to
be
found
in
all
the
annals
of
the
melancholy
human
comedy
but
this
observer
who
was
absent
from
the
inner
courts
of
the
louvre
was
to
be
found
in
the
streets
gazing
with
flashing
eyes
and
breaking
out
into
loud
threats
this
observer
was
the
people
who
with
its
marvellous
instinct
made
keener
by
hatred
watched
from
afar
the
shadows
of
its
implacable
enemies
and
translated
the
impressions
they
made
with
as
great
clearness
as
an
inquisitive
person
can
do
before
the
windows
of
a
hermetically
sealed
the
music
intoxicates
and
governs
the
dancers
but
the
inquisitive
person
sees
only
the
movement
and
laughs
at
the
puppet
jumping
about
without
reason
because
the
inquisitive
person
hears
no
music
the
music
that
intoxicated
the
huguenots
was
the
voice
of
their
pride
the
gleams
which
caught
the
eyes
of
the
parisians
that
midnight
were
the
lightning
flashes
of
their
hatred
illuminating
the
future
and
meantime
everything
was
still
festive
within
and
a
murmur
softer
and
more
flattering
than
ever
was
at
this
moment
pervading
the
louvre
for
the
youthful
bride
having
laid
aside
her
toilet
of
ceremony
her
long
mantle
and
flowing
veil
had
just
returned
to
the
accompanied
by
the
lovely
duchesse
de
nevers
her
most
intimate
friend
and
led
by
her
brother
charles
who
presented
her
to
the
principal
guests
the
bride
was
the
daughter
of
henry
was
the
pearl
of
the
crown
of
france
was
marguerite
de
valois
whom
in
his
familiar
tenderness
for
her
king
charles
ix
always
called
soeur
my
sister
margot
assuredly
never
was
any
welcome
however
flattering
more
richly
deserved
than
that
which
the
new
queen
of
navarre
was
at
this
moment
receiving
marguerite
at
this
period
was
scarcely
twenty
and
she
was
already
the
object
of
all
the
poets
eulogies
some
of
whom
compared
her
to
aurora
others
to
cytherea
she
was
in
truth
a
beauty
without
rival
in
that
court
in
which
catharine
de
médicis
had
assembled
the
loveliest
women
she
could
find
to
make
of
them
her
sirens
marguerite
had
black
hair
and
a
brilliant
complexion
a
voluptuous
eye
veiled
by
long
lashes
delicate
coral
lips
a
slender
neck
a
graceful
opulent
figure
and
concealed
in
a
satin
slipper
a
tiny
foot
the
french
who
possessed
her
were
proud
to
see
such
a
lovely
flower
flourishing
in
their
soil
and
foreigners
who
passed
through
france
returned
home
dazzled
with
her
beauty
if
they
had
but
seen
her
and
amazed
at
her
knowledge
if
they
had
discoursed
with
her
for
marguerite
was
not
only
the
loveliest
she
was
also
the
most
erudite
woman
of
her
time
and
every
one
was
quoting
the
remark
of
an
italian
scholar
who
had
been
presented
to
her
and
who
after
having
conversed
with
her
for
an
hour
in
italian
spanish
latin
and
greek
had
gone
away
saying
to
see
the
court
without
seeing
marguerite
de
valois
is
to
see
neither
france
nor
the
court
thus
addresses
to
king
charles
ix
and
the
queen
of
navarre
were
not
wanting
it
is
well
known
that
the
huguenots
were
great
hands
at
addresses
many
allusions
to
the
past
many
hints
as
to
the
future
were
adroitly
slipped
into
these
harangues
but
to
all
such
allusions
and
speeches
the
king
replied
with
his
pale
lips
and
artificial
smiles
in
giving
my
sister
margot
to
henry
of
navarre
i
give
my
sister
to
all
the
protestants
of
the
kingdom
this
phrase
assured
some
and
made
others
smile
for
it
had
really
a
double
sense
the
one
paternal
with
which
charles
ix
would
not
load
his
mind
the
other
insulting
to
the
bride
to
her
husband
and
also
to
him
who
said
it
for
it
recalled
some
scandalous
rumors
with
which
the
chroniclers
of
the
court
had
already
found
means
to
smirch
the
nuptial
robe
of
marguerite
de
valois
however
de
guise
was
conversing
as
we
have
said
with
téligny
but
he
did
not
pay
to
the
conversation
such
sustained
attention
but
that
he
turned
away
somewhat
from
time
to
time
to
cast
a
glance
at
the
group
of
ladies
in
the
centre
of
whom
glittered
the
queen
of
navarre
when
the
princess
eye
thus
met
that
of
the
young
duke
a
cloud
seemed
to
that
lovely
brow
around
which
stars
of
diamonds
formed
a
tremulous
halo
and
some
agitating
thought
might
be
divined
in
her
restless
and
impatient
manner
the
princess
claude
marguerite
eldest
sister
who
had
been
for
some
years
married
to
the
duc
de
lorraine
had
observed
this
uneasiness
and
was
going
up
to
her
to
inquire
the
cause
when
all
stood
aside
at
the
approach
of
the
queen
mother
who
came
forward
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
young
prince
de
condé
and
the
princess
was
thus
suddenly
separated
from
her
sister
there
was
a
general
movement
by
which
the
duc
de
guise
profited
to
approach
madame
de
nevers
his
and
marguerite
madame
de
lorraine
who
had
not
lost
sight
of
her
sister
then
remarked
instead
of
the
cloud
which
she
had
before
observed
on
her
forehead
a
burning
blush
come
into
her
cheeks
the
duke
approached
still
nearer
and
when
he
was
within
two
steps
of
marguerite
she
appeared
rather
to
feel
than
see
his
presence
and
turned
round
making
a
violent
effort
over
herself
in
order
to
give
her
features
an
appearance
of
calmness
and
indifference
the
duke
then
respectfully
bowing
murmured
in
a
low
tone
that
meant
i
have
brought
it
or
brought
it
myself
marguerite
returned
the
young
duke
bow
and
as
she
straightened
herself
replied
in
the
same
tone
pro
that
meant
as
usual
these
soft
words
absorbed
by
the
enormous
collar
which
the
princess
wore
as
in
the
bell
of
a
were
heard
only
by
the
person
to
whom
they
were
addressed
but
brief
as
had
been
the
conference
it
doubtless
composed
all
the
young
couple
had
to
say
for
after
this
exchange
of
two
words
for
three
they
separated
marguerite
more
thoughtful
and
the
duke
with
his
brow
less
clouded
than
when
they
met
this
little
scene
took
place
without
the
person
most
interested
appearing
to
remark
it
for
the
king
of
navarre
had
eyes
but
for
one
lady
and
she
had
around
her
a
suite
almost
as
numerous
as
that
which
followed
marguerite
de
valois
this
was
the
beautiful
madame
de
sauve
charlotte
de
beaune
semblançay
granddaughter
of
the
unfortunate
semblançay
and
wife
of
simon
de
fizes
baron
de
sauve
was
one
of
the
to
catharine
de
médicis
and
one
of
the
most
redoubtable
auxiliaries
of
this
queen
who
poured
forth
to
her
enemies
when
she
dared
not
pour
out
florentine
poison
delicately
fair
and
by
turns
sparkling
with
vivacity
or
languishing
in
melancholy
always
ready
for
love
and
intrigue
the
two
great
occupations
which
for
fifty
years
employed
the
court
of
the
three
succeeding
kings
a
woman
in
every
acceptation
of
the
word
and
in
all
the
charm
of
the
idea
from
the
blue
eye
languishing
or
flashing
with
fire
to
the
small
rebellious
feet
arched
in
their
velvet
slippers
madame
de
sauve
had
already
for
some
months
taken
complete
possession
of
every
faculty
of
the
king
of
navarre
then
beginning
his
career
as
a
lover
as
well
as
a
politician
thus
it
was
that
marguerite
de
valois
a
magnificent
and
royal
beauty
had
not
even
excited
admiration
in
her
husband
heart
and
what
was
more
strange
and
astonished
all
the
world
even
from
a
soul
so
full
of
darkness
and
mystery
catharine
de
médicis
while
she
prosecuted
her
project
of
union
between
her
daughter
and
the
king
of
navarre
had
not
ceased
to
favor
almost
openly
his
amour
with
madame
de
sauve
but
despite
this
powerful
aid
and
despite
the
easy
manners
of
the
age
the
lovely
charlotte
had
hitherto
resisted
and
this
resistance
unheard
of
incredible
unprecedented
even
more
than
the
beauty
and
wit
of
her
who
resisted
had
excited
in
the
heart
of
the
béarnais
a
passion
which
unable
to
satisfy
itself
had
destroyed
in
the
young
king
heart
all
timidity
pride
and
even
that
carelessness
half
philosophic
half
indolent
which
formed
the
basis
of
his
character
madame
de
sauve
had
been
only
a
few
minutes
in
the
ballroom
from
spite
or
grief
she
had
at
first
resolved
on
not
being
present
at
her
triumph
and
under
the
pretext
of
an
indisposition
had
allowed
her
husband
who
had
been
for
five
years
secretary
of
state
to
go
alone
to
the
louvre
but
when
catharine
de
médicis
saw
the
baron
without
his
wife
she
asked
the
cause
that
kept
her
dear
charlotte
away
and
when
she
found
that
the
indisposition
was
but
slight
she
wrote
a
few
words
to
her
which
the
lady
hastened
to
obey
henry
sad
as
he
had
at
first
been
at
her
absence
had
yet
breathed
more
freely
when
he
saw
de
sauve
enter
alone
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
pay
some
court
to
the
charming
creature
whom
he
was
condemned
if
not
to
love
at
least
to
treat
as
his
wife
he
unexpectedly
saw
madame
de
sauve
arise
from
the
farther
end
of
the
gallery
he
remained
stationary
on
the
spot
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
circe
who
enthralled
him
as
if
by
magic
chains
and
instead
of
proceeding
towards
his
wife
by
a
movement
of
hesitation
which
betrayed
more
astonishment
than
alarm
he
advanced
to
meet
madame
de
sauve
the
courtiers
seeing
the
king
of
navarre
whose
inflammable
heart
they
knew
approach
the
beautiful
charlotte
had
not
the
courage
to
prevent
their
meeting
but
drew
aside
complaisantly
so
that
at
the
very
moment
when
marguerite
de
valois
and
monsieur
de
guise
exchanged
the
few
words
in
latin
which
we
have
noted
above
henry
having
approached
madame
de
sauve
began
in
very
intelligible
french
although
with
somewhat
of
a
gascon
accent
a
conversation
by
no
means
so
mysterious
ah
he
said
you
have
then
come
at
the
very
moment
when
they
assured
me
that
you
were
ill
and
i
had
lost
all
hope
of
seeing
you
would
your
majesty
perhaps
wish
me
to
believe
that
it
had
cost
you
something
to
lose
this
hope
replied
madame
de
sauve
by
heaven
i
believe
it
replied
the
béarnais
know
you
not
that
you
are
my
sun
by
day
and
my
star
by
night
by
my
faith
i
was
in
deepest
darkness
till
you
appeared
and
suddenly
illumined
all
then
monseigneur
i
serve
you
a
very
ill
turn
what
do
you
mean
inquired
henry
i
mean
that
he
who
is
master
of
the
handsomest
woman
in
france
should
only
have
one
desire
that
the
light
should
disappear
and
give
way
to
darkness
for
happiness
awaits
you
in
the
darkness
you
know
cruel
one
that
my
happiness
is
in
the
hands
of
one
woman
only
and
that
she
laughs
at
poor
henry
oh
replied
the
baroness
i
believed
on
the
contrary
that
it
was
this
person
who
was
the
sport
and
jest
of
the
king
of
navarre
henry
was
alarmed
at
this
hostile
attitude
and
yet
he
bethought
him
that
it
betrayed
jealous
spite
and
that
jealous
spite
is
only
the
mask
of
love
indeed
dear
charlotte
you
reproach
me
very
unjustly
and
i
do
not
comprehend
how
so
lovely
a
mouth
can
be
so
cruel
do
you
suppose
for
a
moment
that
it
is
i
who
give
myself
in
marriage
no
saint
it
is
not
i
it
is
i
perhaps
said
the
baroness
sharply
if
ever
the
voice
of
the
woman
who
loves
us
and
reproaches
us
for
not
loving
her
can
seem
sharp
with
your
lovely
eyes
have
you
not
seen
farther
baroness
no
no
henry
of
navarre
is
not
marrying
marguerite
de
valois
and
who
pray
is
why
by
heaven
it
is
the
reformed
religion
marrying
the
pope
all
no
no
i
can
not
be
deceived
by
your
jests
monseigneur
loves
madame
marguerite
and
can
i
blame
you
heaven
forbid
she
is
beautiful
enough
to
be
adored
henry
reflected
for
a
moment
and
as
he
reflected
a
meaning
smile
curled
the
corner
of
his
lips
baroness
said
he
you
seem
to
be
seeking
a
quarrel
with
me
but
you
have
no
right
to
do
so
what
have
you
done
to
prevent
me
from
marrying
madame
marguerite
nothing
on
the
contrary
you
have
always
driven
me
to
despair
and
well
for
me
that
i
have
monseigneur
replied
madame
de
sauve
how
so
why
of
course
because
you
are
marrying
another
woman
i
marry
her
because
you
love
me
not
if
i
had
loved
you
sire
i
must
have
died
in
an
hour
in
an
hour
what
do
you
mean
and
of
what
death
would
you
have
died
of
jealousy
for
in
an
hour
the
queen
of
navarre
will
send
away
her
women
and
your
majesty
your
gentlemen
is
that
really
the
thought
that
is
uppermost
in
your
mind
i
did
not
say
so
i
only
say
that
if
i
loved
you
it
would
be
uppermost
in
my
mind
most
tormentingly
very
well
said
henry
at
the
height
of
joy
on
hearing
this
confession
the
first
which
she
had
made
to
him
suppose
the
king
of
navarre
should
not
send
away
his
gentlemen
this
evening
sire
replied
madame
de
sauve
looking
at
the
king
with
astonishment
for
once
unfeigned
you
say
things
impossible
and
incredible
what
must
i
do
to
make
you
believe
them
give
me
a
proof
and
that
proof
you
can
not
give
me
yes
baroness
yes
by
saint
henry
i
will
give
it
you
exclaimed
the
king
gazing
at
the
young
woman
with
eyes
hot
with
love
oh
your
majesty
exclaimed
the
lovely
charlotte
in
an
undertone
and
with
downcast
eyes
i
do
not
understand
no
no
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
turn
your
back
on
the
happiness
awaiting
you
there
are
four
henrys
in
this
room
my
adorable
replied
the
king
henry
de
france
henry
de
condé
henry
de
guise
but
there
is
only
one
henry
of
navarre
well
well
if
this
henry
of
navarre
is
with
you
all
night
all
night
yes
will
that
be
a
certain
proof
to
you
that
he
is
not
with
any
other
ah
if
you
do
that
sire
cried
madame
sauve
on
the
honor
of
a
gentleman
i
will
do
it
madame
de
sauve
raised
her
great
eyes
dewy
with
voluptuous
promises
and
looked
at
the
king
whose
heart
was
filled
with
an
intoxicating
joy
and
then
said
henry
what
will
you
say
i
will
say
replied
charlotte
that
your
majesty
really
loves
me
saint
then
you
shall
say
it
baroness
for
it
is
true
but
how
can
you
manage
it
murmured
madame
de
sauve
oh
by
heaven
baroness
have
you
not
about
you
some
some
girl
whom
you
can
trust
yes
dariole
is
so
devoted
to
me
that
she
would
let
herself
be
cut
in
pieces
for
me
she
is
a
real
treasure
by
heaven
then
say
to
her
that
i
will
make
her
fortune
when
i
am
king
of
france
as
the
astrologers
prophesy
charlotte
smiled
for
even
at
this
period
the
gascon
reputation
of
the
béarnais
was
already
established
with
respect
to
his
promises
well
then
what
do
you
want
dariole
to
do
little
for
her
a
great
deal
for
me
your
apartment
is
over
mine
yes
let
her
wait
behind
the
door
i
will
knock
gently
three
times
she
will
open
the
door
and
you
will
have
the
proof
that
i
have
promised
you
madame
de
sauve
kept
silence
for
several
seconds
and
then
as
if
she
had
looked
around
her
to
observe
if
she
were
overheard
she
fastened
her
gaze
for
a
moment
on
the
group
clustering
around
the
queen
mother
brief
as
the
moment
was
it
was
sufficient
for
catharine
and
her
to
exchange
a
look
oh
if
i
were
inclined
said
madame
de
sauve
with
a
siren
accent
that
would
have
melted
the
wax
in
ulysses
ears
if
i
were
inclined
to
make
your
majesty
tell
a
falsehood
try
ah
i
confess
i
am
tempted
to
do
so
give
in
women
are
never
so
strong
as
after
they
are
defeated
sire
i
hold
you
to
your
promise
for
dariole
when
you
shall
be
king
of
france
henry
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
at
the
precise
moment
when
this
cry
escaped
the
lips
of
the
béarnais
the
queen
of
navarre
was
replying
to
the
duc
de
guise
pro
as
usual
then
henry
turned
away
from
madame
de
sauve
as
happy
as
the
duc
de
guise
had
been
when
he
left
marguerite
de
valois
an
hour
after
the
double
scene
we
have
just
related
king
charles
and
the
queen
mother
retired
to
their
apartments
almost
immediately
the
rooms
began
to
empty
the
galleries
exhibited
the
bases
of
their
marble
columns
the
admiral
and
the
prince
de
condé
were
escorted
home
by
four
hundred
huguenot
gentlemen
through
the
middle
of
the
crowd
which
hooted
as
they
passed
then
henry
de
guise
with
the
lorraine
gentlemen
and
the
catholics
left
in
their
turn
greeted
by
cries
of
joy
and
plaudits
of
the
people
but
marguerite
de
valois
henry
de
navarre
and
madame
de
sauve
lived
in
the
louvre
chapter
ii
the
queen
of
navarre
bedchamber
the
duc
de
guise
escorted
his
the
duchess
de
nevers
to
her
hôtel
in
the
rue
du
chaume
facing
the
rue
de
brac
and
after
he
had
put
her
into
the
hands
of
her
women
he
went
to
his
own
apartment
to
change
his
dress
put
on
a
night
cloak
and
armed
himself
with
one
of
those
short
keen
poniards
which
are
called
de
and
were
worn
without
swords
but
as
he
took
it
off
the
table
on
which
it
lay
he
perceived
a
small
billet
between
the
blade
and
the
scabbard
he
opened
it
and
read
as
follows
hope
de
guise
will
not
return
to
the
louvre
or
if
he
does
that
he
will
at
least
take
the
precaution
to
arm
himself
with
a
good
coat
of
mail
and
a
proved
aha
said
the
duke
addressing
his
valet
this
is
a
singular
warning
maître
robin
now
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
who
has
been
here
during
my
absence
only
one
person
monseigneur
who
monsieur
du
gast
aha
in
fact
methinks
i
recognize
the
handwriting
and
you
are
sure
that
du
gast
came
you
saw
him
more
than
that
monseigneur
i
spoke
with
him
very
good
then
i
will
follow
his
advice
my
steel
jacket
and
my
sword
the
valet
accustomed
to
these
changes
of
costume
brought
both
the
duke
put
on
his
jacket
which
was
made
of
rings
of
steel
so
fine
that
it
was
scarcely
thicker
than
velvet
he
then
drew
on
over
his
coat
of
mail
his
small
clothes
and
a
doublet
of
gray
and
silver
his
favorite
colors
put
on
a
pair
of
long
boots
which
reached
to
the
middle
of
his
thighs
covered
his
head
with
a
velvet
toque
unadorned
with
feathers
or
precious
stones
threw
over
his
shoulders
a
cloak
hung
a
dagger
by
his
side
handed
his
sword
to
a
page
the
only
attendant
he
allowed
to
accompany
him
and
took
the
way
to
the
louvre
as
he
went
down
the
steps
of
the
hôtel
the
watchman
of
saint
germain
had
just
announced
one
in
the
morning
though
the
night
was
far
gone
and
the
streets
at
this
time
were
very
far
from
safe
no
accident
befell
the
adventurous
prince
on
the
way
and
safe
and
sound
he
approached
the
colossal
mass
of
the
ancient
louvre
all
the
lights
of
which
had
been
extinguished
one
after
the
other
so
that
it
rose
portentous
in
its
silence
and
darkness
in
front
of
the
royal
château
was
a
deep
fosse
looking
into
which
were
the
chambers
of
most
of
the
princes
who
inhabited
the
palace
marguerite
apartment
was
on
the
first
floor
but
this
first
floor
easily
accessible
but
for
the
fosse
was
in
consequence
of
the
depth
to
which
that
was
cut
thirty
feet
from
the
bottom
of
the
wall
and
consequently
out
of
the
reach
of
robbers
or
lovers
nevertheless
the
duc
de
guise
approached
it
without
hesitation
at
the
same
moment
was
heard
the
noise
of
a
window
which
opened
on
the
ground
floor
this
window
was
grated
but
a
hand
appeared
lifted
out
one
of
the
bars
which
had
been
loosened
and
dropped
from
it
a
silken
lace
is
that
you
gillonne
said
the
duke
in
a
low
voice
yes
monseigneur
replied
a
woman
voice
in
a
still
lower
tone
and
marguerite
is
waiting
for
you
is
well
hereupon
the
duke
made
a
signal
to
his
page
who
opening
his
cloak
took
out
a
small
rope
ladder
the
prince
fastened
one
end
to
the
silk
lace
and
gillonne
drawing
it
up
tied
it
securely
then
the
prince
after
having
buckled
his
sword
to
his
belt
ascended
without
accident
when
he
had
entered
the
bar
was
replaced
and
the
window
closed
while
the
page
having
seen
his
master
quietly
enter
the
louvre
to
the
windows
of
which
he
had
accompanied
him
twenty
times
in
the
same
way
laid
himself
down
in
his
cloak
on
the
grass
of
the
fosse
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
wall
the
night
was
extremely
dark
and
large
drops
of
warm
rain
were
falling
from
the
heavy
clouds
charged
with
electric
fluid
the
duc
de
guise
followed
his
guide
who
was
no
other
than
the
daughter
of
jacques
de
matignon
maréchal
of
france
she
was
the
especial
confidante
of
marguerite
who
kept
no
secret
from
her
and
it
was
said
that
among
the
number
of
mysteries
entrusted
to
her
incorruptible
fidelity
there
were
some
so
terrible
as
to
compel
her
to
keep
the
rest
there
was
no
light
left
either
in
the
low
rooms
or
in
the
corridors
only
from
time
to
time
a
livid
glare
illuminated
the
dark
apartments
with
a
vivid
flash
which
as
instantly
disappeared
the
duke
still
guided
by
his
conductress
who
held
his
hand
reached
a
staircase
built
in
the
thick
wall
and
opening
by
a
secret
and
invisible
door
into
the
antechamber
of
marguerite
apartment
in
this
antechamber
which
like
all
the
other
lower
rooms
was
perfectly
dark
gillonne
stopped
have
you
brought
what
the
queen
requested
she
inquired
in
a
low
voice
yes
replied
the
duc
de
guise
but
i
will
give
it
only
to
her
majesty
in
person
come
then
and
do
not
lose
an
instant
said
a
voice
from
the
darkness
which
made
the
duke
start
for
he
recognized
it
as
marguerite
at
the
same
moment
a
curtain
of
violet
velvet
covered
with
golden
was
raised
and
the
duke
made
out
the
form
of
the
queen
who
in
her
impatience
had
come
to
meet
him
i
am
here
madame
he
then
said
and
he
passed
the
curtain
which
fell
behind
him
so
marguerite
de
valois
herself
now
became
the
guide
leading
him
into
the
room
which
however
he
knew
already
while
gillonne
standing
at
the
door
had
raised
her
finger
to
her
lips
and
reassured
her
royal
mistress
as
if
she
understood
the
duke
jealous
apprehensions
marguerite
led
him
to
the
bedchamber
and
there
paused
well
she
said
are
you
satisfied
duke
satisfied
madame
was
the
reply
and
with
what
of
the
proof
i
give
you
retorted
marguerite
with
a
slight
tone
of
vexation
in
her
voice
that
i
belong
to
a
man
who
on
the
very
night
of
his
marriage
makes
me
of
such
small
importance
that
he
does
not
even
come
to
thank
me
for
the
honor
i
have
done
him
not
in
selecting
but
in
accepting
him
for
my
husband
oh
madame
said
the
duke
sorrowfully
be
assured
he
will
come
if
you
desire
it
and
do
you
say
that
henry
cried
marguerite
you
who
better
than
any
know
the
contrary
of
what
you
say
if
i
had
that
desire
should
i
have
asked
you
to
come
to
the
louvre
you
have
asked
me
to
come
to
the
louvre
marguerite
because
you
are
anxious
to
destroy
every
vestige
of
our
past
and
because
that
past
lives
not
only
in
my
memory
but
in
this
silver
casket
which
i
bring
to
you
henry
shall
i
say
one
thing
to
you
replied
marguerite
gazing
earnestly
at
the
duke
it
is
that
you
are
more
like
a
schoolboy
than
a
prince
i
deny
that
i
have
loved
you
i
desire
to
quench
a
flame
which
will
die
perhaps
but
the
reflection
of
which
will
never
die
for
the
loves
of
persons
of
my
rank
illumine
and
frequently
devour
the
whole
epoch
contemporary
with
them
no
no
duke
you
may
keep
the
letters
of
your
marguerite
and
the
casket
she
has
given
you
she
asks
but
one
of
these
letters
and
that
only
because
it
is
as
dangerous
for
you
as
for
herself
it
is
all
yours
said
the
duke
take
the
one
that
you
wish
to
destroy
marguerite
searched
anxiously
in
the
open
casket
and
with
a
tremulous
hand
took
one
after
the
other
a
dozen
letters
only
the
addresses
of
which
she
examined
as
if
by
merely
glancing
at
these
she
could
recall
to
her
memory
what
the
letters
themselves
contained
but
after
a
close
scrutiny
she
looked
at
the
duke
pale
and
agitated
sir
she
said
what
i
seek
is
not
here
can
you
have
lost
it
by
any
accident
for
if
it
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
what
letter
do
you
seek
madame
that
in
which
i
told
you
to
marry
without
delay
as
an
excuse
for
your
infidelity
marguerite
shrugged
her
shoulders
no
but
to
save
your
life
the
one
in
which
i
told
you
that
the
king
seeing
our
love
and
my
exertions
to
break
off
your
proposed
marriage
with
the
infanta
of
portugal
had
sent
for
his
brother
the
bastard
of
angoulême
and
said
to
him
pointing
to
two
swords
this
slay
henry
de
guise
this
night
or
with
the
other
i
will
slay
thee
in
the
where
is
that
letter
here
said
the
duke
drawing
it
from
his
breast
marguerite
almost
snatched
it
from
his
hands
opened
it
anxiously
assured
herself
that
it
was
really
the
one
she
desired
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
and
applying
the
lighted
candle
to
it
the
flames
instantly
consumed
the
paper
then
as
if
marguerite
feared
that
her
imprudent
words
might
be
read
in
the
very
ashes
she
trampled
them
under
foot
during
all
this
the
duc
de
guise
had
watched
his
mistress
attentively
well
marguerite
he
said
when
she
had
finished
are
you
satisfied
now
yes
for
now
that
you
have
wedded
the
princesse
de
porcian
my
brother
will
forgive
me
your
love
while
he
would
never
have
pardoned
me
for
revealing
a
secret
such
as
that
which
in
my
weakness
for
you
i
had
not
the
strength
to
conceal
from
you
true
replied
de
guise
then
you
loved
me
and
i
love
you
still
henry
as
much
more
than
ever
you
i
do
for
never
more
than
at
this
moment
did
i
need
a
sincere
and
devoted
friend
queen
i
have
no
throne
wife
i
have
no
husband
the
young
prince
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
i
tell
you
i
repeat
to
you
henri
that
my
husband
not
only
does
not
love
me
but
hates
despises
me
indeed
it
seems
to
me
that
your
presence
in
the
chamber
in
which
he
ought
to
be
is
proof
of
this
hatred
this
contempt
it
is
not
yet
late
madame
and
the
king
of
navarre
requires
time
to
dismiss
his
gentlemen
if
he
has
not
already
come
he
will
come
soon
and
i
tell
you
cried
marguerite
with
increasing
vexation
i
tell
you
that
he
will
not
come
madame
exclaimed
gillonne
suddenly
entering
the
king
of
navarre
is
just
leaving
his
apartments
oh
i
knew
he
would
come
exclaimed
the
duc
de
guise
henri
said
marguerite
in
a
quick
tone
and
seizing
the
hand
henri
you
shall
see
if
i
am
a
woman
of
my
word
and
if
i
may
be
relied
on
henri
enter
that
closet
madame
allow
me
to
go
while
there
is
yet
time
for
reflect
that
the
first
mark
of
love
you
bestow
on
him
i
shall
quit
the
cabinet
and
then
woe
to
him
are
you
mad
go
in
go
in
i
say
and
i
will
be
responsible
for
all
and
she
pushed
the
duke
into
the
closet
it
was
time
the
door
was
scarcely
closed
behind
the
prince
when
the
king
of
navarre
escorted
by
two
pages
who
carried
eight
torches
of
yellow
wax
in
two
candelabra
appeared
smiling
on
the
threshold
of
the
chamber
marguerite
concealed
her
trouble
and
made
a
low
bow
you
are
not
yet
in
bed
madame
observed
the
béarnais
with
his
frank
and
joyous
look
were
you
by
chance
waiting
for
me
no
monsieur
replied
marguerite
for
yesterday
you
repeated
to
me
that
our
marriage
was
a
political
alliance
and
that
you
would
never
thwart
my
wishes
assuredly
but
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
confer
a
little
together
gillonne
close
the
door
and
leave
us
marguerite
who
was
sitting
then
rose
and
extended
her
hand
as
if
to
desire
the
pages
to
remain
must
i
call
your
women
inquired
the
king
i
will
do
so
if
such
be
your
desire
although
i
confess
that
for
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
i
should
prefer
our
being
alone
and
the
king
of
navarre
advanced
towards
the
closet
no
exclaimed
marguerite
hastily
going
before
him
no
there
is
no
occasion
for
that
i
am
ready
to
hear
you
the
béarnais
had
learned
what
he
desired
to
know
he
threw
a
rapid
and
penetrating
glance
towards
the
cabinet
as
if
in
spite
of
the
thick
curtain
which
hung
before
it
he
would
dive
into
its
obscurity
and
then
turning
his
looks
to
his
lovely
wife
pale
with
terror
he
said
with
the
utmost
composure
in
that
case
madame
let
us
confer
for
a
few
moments
as
your
majesty
pleases
said
the
young
wife
falling
into
rather
than
sitting
upon
the
seat
which
her
husband
pointed
out
to
her
the
béarnais
placed
himself
beside
her
madame
he
continued
whatever
many
persons
may
have
said
i
think
our
marriage
is
a
good
marriage
i
stand
well
with
you
you
stand
well
with
me
but
said
marguerite
alarmed
consequently
we
ought
observed
the
king
of
navarre
without
seeming
to
notice
marguerite
hesitation
to
act
towards
each
other
like
good
allies
since
we
have
sworn
alliance
in
the
presence
of
god
do
you
think
so
unquestionably
monsieur
i
know
madame
how
great
your
penetration
is
i
know
how
the
ground
at
court
is
intersected
with
dangerous
abysses
now
i
am
young
and
although
i
never
injured
any
one
i
have
a
great
many
enemies
in
which
camp
madame
ought
i
to
range
her
who
bears
my
name
and
who
has
vowed
her
affection
to
me
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
monsieur
could
you
think
i
think
nothing
madame
i
hope
and
i
am
anxious
to
know
that
my
hope
is
well
founded
it
is
quite
certain
that
our
marriage
is
merely
a
pretext
or
a
snare
marguerite
started
for
perhaps
the
same
thought
had
occurred
to
her
own
mind
now
then
which
of
the
two
continued
henri
de
navarre
the
king
hates
me
the
duc
hates
me
the
duc
hates
me
catherine
de
médicis
hated
my
mother
too
much
not
to
hate
me
oh
monsieur
what
are
you
saying
the
truth
madame
replied
the
king
and
in
order
that
it
may
not
be
supposed
that
i
am
deceived
as
to
monsieur
de
mouy
assassination
and
the
poisoning
of
my
mother
i
wish
that
some
one
were
here
who
could
hear
me
oh
sire
replied
marguerite
with
an
air
as
calm
and
smiling
as
she
could
assume
you
know
very
well
that
there
is
no
person
here
but
you
and
myself
it
is
for
that
very
reason
that
i
thus
give
vent
to
my
thoughts
this
it
is
that
emboldens
me
to
declare
that
i
am
not
deceived
by
the
caresses
showered
on
me
by
the
house
of
france
or
the
house
of
lorraine
sire
sire
exclaimed
marguerite
well
what
is
it
inquired
henry
smiling
in
his
turn
why
sire
such
remarks
are
very
dangerous
not
when
we
are
alone
observed
the
king
i
was
saying
marguerite
was
evidently
distressed
she
desired
to
stop
every
word
the
king
uttered
but
he
continued
with
his
apparent
good
nature
i
was
telling
you
that
i
was
threatened
on
all
sides
threatened
by
the
king
threatened
by
the
duc
threatened
by
the
duc
threatened
by
the
queen
mother
threatened
by
the
duc
de
guise
by
the
duc
de
mayenne
by
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
threatened
in
fact
by
every
one
one
feels
that
instinctively
as
you
know
madame
well
against
all
these
threats
which
must
soon
become
attacks
i
can
defend
myself
by
your
aid
for
you
are
beloved
by
all
the
persons
who
detest
me
i
said
marguerite
yes
you
replied
henry
with
the
utmost
ease
of
manner
yes
you
are
beloved
by
king
charles
you
are
beloved
he
laid
strong
emphasis
on
the
word
by
the
duc
you
are
beloved
by
queen
catharine
and
you
are
beloved
by
the
duc
de
guise
sire
murmured
marguerite
yes
and
what
is
there
astonishing
in
the
fact
that
every
one
loves
you
all
i
have
mentioned
are
your
brothers
or
relatives
to
love
brothers
and
relatives
is
to
live
according
to
god
heart
but
what
then
asked
marguerite
greatly
overcome
what
do
you
mean
what
i
have
just
said
that
if
you
will
be
i
do
not
mean
my
love
but
my
ally
i
can
brave
everything
while
on
the
other
hand
if
you
become
my
enemy
i
am
lost
oh
your
enemy
never
sir
exclaimed
marguerite
and
my
love
never
either
perhaps
and
my
ally
most
decidedly
and
marguerite
turned
round
and
offered
her
hand
to
the
king
henry
took
it
kissed
it
gallantly
and
retaining
it
in
his
own
more
from
a
desire
of
investigation
than
from
any
sentiment
of
tenderness
said
very
well
i
believe
you
madame
and
accept
the
alliance
they
married
us
without
our
knowing
each
other
without
our
loving
each
other
they
married
us
without
consulting
us
us
whom
they
united
we
therefore
owe
nothing
to
each
other
as
man
and
wife
you
see
that
i
even
go
beyond
your
wishes
and
confirm
this
evening
what
i
said
to
you
yesterday
but
we
ally
ourselves
freely
and
without
any
compulsion
we
ally
ourselves
as
two
loyal
hearts
who
owe
each
other
mutual
protection
should
ally
themselves
is
as
such
you
understand
it
yes
sir
said
marguerite
endeavoring
to
withdraw
her
hand
well
then
continued
the
béarnais
with
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
door
of
the
cabinet
as
the
first
proof
of
a
frank
alliance
is
the
most
perfect
confidence
i
will
now
relate
to
you
madame
in
all
its
details
the
plan
i
have
formed
in
order
that
we
may
victoriously
meet
and
overcome
all
these
enmities
sire
said
marguerite
in
spite
of
herself
turning
her
eyes
toward
the
closet
whilst
the
béarnais
seeing
his
trick
succeed
laughed
in
his
sleeve
this
is
what
i
mean
to
do
he
continued
without
appearing
to
remark
his
young
wife
nervousness
i
intend
sire
said
marguerite
rising
hastily
and
seizing
the
king
arm
allow
me
a
little
breath
my
emotion
the
heat
overpowers
me
and
in
truth
marguerite
was
as
pale
and
trembling
as
if
she
was
about
to
fall
on
the
carpet
henry
went
straight
to
a
window
some
distance
off
and
opened
it
this
window
looked
out
on
the
river
marguerite
followed
him
silence
sire
silence
for
your
own
sake
she
murmured
what
madame
said
the
béarnais
with
his
peculiar
smile
did
you
not
tell
me
we
were
alone
yes
sire
but
did
you
not
hear
me
say
that
by
the
aid
of
a
tube
introduced
into
the
ceiling
or
the
wall
everything
could
be
heard
well
madame
well
said
the
béarnais
earnestly
and
in
a
low
voice
it
is
true
you
do
not
love
me
but
you
are
at
least
honorable
what
do
you
mean
sire
i
mean
that
if
you
were
capable
of
betraying
me
you
would
have
allowed
me
to
go
on
as
i
was
betraying
myself
you
stopped
me
i
now
know
that
some
one
is
concealed
here
that
you
are
an
unfaithful
wife
but
a
faithful
ally
and
just
now
i
confess
i
have
more
need
of
fidelity
in
politics
than
in
love
sire
replied
marguerite
confused
good
good
we
will
talk
of
this
hereafter
said
henry
when
we
know
each
other
better
then
raising
his
voice
well
he
continued
do
you
breathe
more
freely
now
madame
yes
sire
yes
well
then
said
the
béarnais
i
will
no
longer
intrude
on
you
i
owed
you
my
respects
and
some
advances
toward
better
acquaintance
deign
then
to
accept
them
as
they
are
offered
with
all
my
heart
and
happy
slumbers
marguerite
raised
her
eyes
shining
with
gratitude
and
offered
her
husband
her
hand
it
is
agreed
she
said
political
alliance
frank
and
loyal
asked
henry
frank
and
loyal
was
the
reply
and
the
béarnais
went
toward
the
door
followed
by
marguerite
look
as
if
she
were
fascinated
then
when
the
curtain
had
fallen
between
them
and
the
bedchamber
thanks
marguerite
he
said
in
a
quick
low
tone
thanks
you
are
a
true
daughter
of
france
i
leave
you
quite
tranquil
lacking
your
love
your
friendship
will
not
fail
me
i
rely
on
you
as
you
on
your
side
may
rely
on
me
adieu
madame
and
henry
kissed
his
wife
hand
and
pressed
it
gently
then
with
a
quick
step
he
returned
to
his
own
apartment
saying
to
himself
in
a
low
voice
in
the
corridor
who
the
devil
is
with
her
is
it
the
king
or
the
duc
or
the
duc
or
the
duc
de
guise
is
it
a
brother
or
a
lover
is
it
both
i
faith
i
am
almost
sorry
now
i
asked
the
baroness
for
this
rendezvous
but
as
my
word
is
pledged
and
dariole
is
waiting
for
me
no
matter
yet
saint
this
margot
as
my
king
charles
calls
her
is
an
adorable
creature
and
with
a
step
which
betrayed
a
slight
hesitation
henry
of
navarre
ascended
the
staircase
which
led
to
madame
de
sauve
apartments
marguerite
had
followed
him
with
her
eyes
until
he
disappeared
then
she
returned
to
her
chamber
and
found
the
duke
at
the
door
of
the
cabinet
the
sight
of
him
almost
touched
her
with
remorse
the
duke
was
grave
and
his
knitted
brow
bespoke
bitter
reflection
marguerite
is
neutral
he
said
in
a
week
marguerite
will
be
hostile
ah
you
have
been
listening
said
marguerite
what
else
could
i
do
in
the
cabinet
and
did
you
find
that
i
behaved
otherwise
than
the
queen
of
navarre
should
behave
no
but
differently
from
the
way
in
which
the
mistress
of
the
duc
de
guise
should
behave
sir
replied
the
queen
i
may
not
love
my
husband
but
no
one
has
the
right
to
require
me
to
betray
him
tell
me
honestly
would
you
reveal
the
secrets
of
the
princesse
de
porcian
your
wife
come
come
madame
answered
the
duke
shaking
his
head
this
is
very
well
i
see
that
you
do
not
love
me
as
in
those
days
when
you
disclosed
to
me
the
plot
of
the
king
against
me
and
my
party
the
king
was
strong
and
you
were
weak
henry
is
weak
and
you
are
strong
you
see
i
always
play
a
consistent
part
only
you
pass
from
one
camp
to
another
that
was
a
right
i
acquired
sir
in
saving
your
life
good
madame
and
as
when
lovers
separate
they
return
all
the
gifts
that
have
passed
between
them
i
will
save
your
life
in
my
turn
if
ever
the
need
arises
and
we
shall
be
quits
and
the
duke
bowed
and
left
the
room
nor
did
marguerite
attempt
to
retain
him
in
the
antechamber
he
found
gillonne
who
guided
him
to
the
window
on
the
ground
floor
and
in
the
fosse
he
found
his
page
with
whom
he
returned
to
the
hôtel
de
guise
marguerite
in
a
dreamy
mood
went
to
the
opened
window
what
a
marriage
night
she
murmured
to
herself
the
husband
flees
from
me
the
lover
forsakes
me
at
that
moment
coming
from
the
tour
de
bois
and
going
up
toward
the
moulin
de
la
monnaie
on
the
other
side
of
the
fosse
passed
a
student
his
hand
on
his
hip
and
singing
song
tell
me
why
o
maiden
fair
when
i
burn
to
bite
thy
hair
and
to
kiss
thy
rosy
lips
and
to
touch
thy
lovely
breast
like
a
nun
thou
thee
blest
in
the
cloister
sad
eclipse
who
will
win
the
precious
prize
of
thy
brow
thy
mouth
thine
eyes
of
thy
bosom
sweet
what
lover
wilt
thou
all
thy
charms
devote
to
grim
pluton
when
the
boat
charon
rows
shall
take
thee
over
after
thou
hast
sailed
across
loveliest
then
wilt
find
but
loss
all
thy
beauty
will
decay
when
i
die
and
meet
thee
there
in
the
shades
i
never
swear
thou
wert
once
my
mistress
gay
therefore
darling
while
we
live
change
thy
mind
and
tokens
give
kisses
from
thy
honey
mouth
else
when
thou
art
like
to
die
thou
repent
thy
cruelty
filling
all
my
life
with
drouth
marguerite
listened
with
a
melancholy
smile
then
when
the
voice
was
lost
in
the
distance
she
shut
the
window
and
called
gillonne
to
help
her
to
prepare
for
bed
chapter
iii
the
the
next
day
and
those
that
followed
were
devoted
to
festivals
balls
and
tournaments
the
same
amalgamation
continued
to
take
place
between
the
two
parties
the
caresses
and
compliments
lavished
were
enough
to
turn
the
heads
of
the
most
bigoted
huguenots
père
cotton
was
to
be
seen
dining
and
carousing
with
the
baron
de
courtaumer
the
duc
de
guise
went
boating
on
the
seine
with
the
prince
de
condé
king
charles
seemed
to
have
laid
aside
his
usual
melancholy
and
could
not
get
enough
of
the
society
of
his
new
henry
moreover
the
queen
mother
was
so
gay
and
so
occupied
with
embroidery
ornaments
and
plumes
that
she
could
not
sleep
the
huguenots
to
some
degree
contaminated
by
this
new
capua
began
to
assume
silken
pourpoints
wear
devices
and
parade
before
certain
balconies
as
if
they
were
catholics
on
every
side
there
was
such
a
reaction
in
favor
of
the
protestants
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
court
was
about
to
become
protestant
even
the
admiral
in
spite
of
his
experience
was
deceived
and
was
so
carried
away
that
one
evening
he
forgot
for
two
whole
hours
to
chew
on
his
toothpick
which
he
always
used
from
two
at
which
time
he
finished
his
dinner
until
eight
at
night
when
he
sat
down
to
supper
the
evening
on
which
the
admiral
thus
unaccountably
deviated
from
his
usual
habit
king
charles
ix
had
invited
henry
of
navarre
and
the
duc
de
guise
to
sup
with
him
after
the
repast
he
took
them
into
his
chamber
and
was
busily
explaining
to
them
the
ingenious
mechanism
of
a
he
had
invented
when
interrupting
himself
is
the
admiral
coming
he
asked
who
has
seen
him
and
can
tell
me
anything
about
him
i
have
said
the
king
of
navarre
and
if
your
majesty
is
anxious
about
his
health
i
can
reassure
you
for
i
saw
him
this
morning
at
six
and
this
evening
at
seven
aha
replied
the
king
whose
eyes
were
instantly
fixed
with
a
searching
expression
on
his
for
a
man
harry
you
are
very
early
yes
sire
answered
the
king
of
navarre
i
wished
to
inquire
of
the
admiral
who
knows
everything
whether
some
gentlemen
i
am
expecting
are
on
their
way
hither
more
gentlemen
why
you
had
eight
hundred
on
the
day
of
your
wedding
and
fresh
ones
join
you
every
day
you
are
surely
not
going
to
invade
us
said
charles
smiling
the
duc
de
guise
frowned
sire
returned
the
béarnais
a
war
with
flanders
is
spoken
of
and
i
am
collecting
round
me
all
those
gentlemen
of
my
country
and
its
neighborhood
whom
i
think
can
be
useful
to
your
majesty
the
duke
calling
to
mind
the
pretended
project
henry
had
mentioned
to
marguerite
the
day
of
their
marriage
listened
still
more
attentively
well
well
replied
the
king
with
his
sinister
smile
the
more
the
better
let
them
all
come
henry
but
who
are
these
gentlemen
brave
ones
i
trust
i
know
not
sire
if
my
gentlemen
will
ever
equal
those
of
your
majesty
or
the
duc
or
the
duc
de
guise
but
i
know
that
they
will
do
their
best
do
you
expect
many
ten
or
a
dozen
more
what
are
their
names
sire
their
names
escape
me
and
with
the
exception
of
one
whom
téligny
recommended
to
me
as
a
most
accomplished
gentleman
and
whose
name
is
de
la
mole
i
can
not
tell
de
la
mole
exclaimed
the
king
who
was
deeply
skilled
in
the
science
of
genealogy
is
he
not
a
lerac
de
la
mole
a
provençal
exactly
so
sire
you
see
i
recruit
even
in
provence
and
i
added
the
duc
de
guise
with
a
sarcastic
smile
go
even
further
than
his
majesty
the
king
of
navarre
for
i
seek
even
in
piedmont
all
the
trusty
catholics
i
can
find
catholic
or
huguenot
interrupted
the
king
it
little
matters
to
me
so
they
are
brave
the
king
face
while
he
uttered
these
words
which
thus
united
catholics
and
huguenots
in
his
thoughts
bore
such
an
expression
of
indifference
that
the
duke
himself
was
surprised
your
majesty
is
occupied
with
the
flemings
said
the
admiral
to
whom
charles
had
some
days
previously
accorded
the
favor
of
entering
without
being
announced
and
who
had
overheard
the
king
last
words
ah
here
is
my
father
the
admiral
cried
charles
opening
his
arms
we
were
speaking
of
war
of
gentlemen
of
brave
men
and
comes
it
is
like
the
lodestone
which
attracts
the
iron
my
of
navarre
and
my
cousin
of
guise
are
expecting
reinforcements
for
your
army
that
was
what
we
were
talking
about
and
these
reinforcements
are
on
their
way
said
the
admiral
have
you
had
news
of
them
asked
the
béarnais
yes
my
son
and
particularly
of
de
la
mole
he
was
at
orléans
yesterday
and
will
be
in
paris
or
the
day
after
the
devil
you
must
be
a
sorcerer
admiral
said
the
duc
de
guise
to
know
what
is
taking
place
at
thirty
or
forty
leagues
distance
i
should
like
to
know
for
a
certainty
what
happened
or
is
happening
before
orléans
coligny
remained
unmoved
at
this
savage
onslaught
which
evidently
alluded
to
the
death
of
françois
de
guise
the
duke
father
killed
before
orléans
by
poltrot
de
méré
and
not
without
a
suspicion
that
the
admiral
had
advised
the
crime
sir
replied
he
coldly
and
with
dignity
i
am
a
sorcerer
whenever
i
wish
to
know
anything
positively
that
concerns
my
own
affairs
or
the
king
my
courier
arrived
an
hour
ago
from
orléans
having
travelled
thanks
to
the
post
leagues
in
a
day
as
de
la
mole
has
only
his
own
horse
he
rides
but
ten
leagues
a
day
and
will
not
arrive
in
paris
before
the
here
is
all
my
magic
bravo
my
father
a
clever
answer
cried
charles
ix
teach
these
young
men
that
wisdom
as
well
as
age
has
whitened
your
hair
and
beard
so
now
we
will
send
them
to
talk
of
their
tournaments
and
their
and
you
and
i
will
stay
and
talk
of
our
wars
good
councillors
make
good
kings
my
father
leave
us
gentlemen
i
wish
to
talk
with
the
admiral
the
two
young
men
took
their
departure
the
king
of
navarre
first
then
the
duc
de
guise
but
outside
the
door
they
separated
after
a
formal
salute
coligny
followed
them
with
his
eyes
not
without
anxiety
for
he
never
saw
those
two
personified
hatreds
meet
without
a
dread
that
some
new
lightning
flash
would
leap
forth
charles
ix
saw
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
and
going
to
him
laid
his
hand
on
his
arm
have
no
fear
my
father
i
am
here
to
preserve
peace
and
obedience
i
am
really
a
king
now
that
my
mother
is
no
longer
queen
and
she
is
no
longer
queen
now
that
coligny
is
my
father
oh
sire
said
the
admiral
queen
catharine
is
a
marplot
peace
is
impossible
with
her
these
italian
catholics
are
furious
and
will
hear
of
nothing
but
extermination
now
for
my
part
i
not
only
wish
to
pacify
but
i
wish
to
put
power
into
the
hands
of
those
that
profess
the
reformed
religion
the
others
are
too
dissolute
and
scandalize
me
by
their
love
affairs
and
their
quarrels
shall
i
speak
frankly
to
you
continued
charles
redoubling
in
energy
i
mistrust
every
one
about
me
except
my
new
friends
i
suspect
tavannes
ambition
vieilleville
cares
only
for
good
wine
and
would
betray
his
king
for
a
cask
of
malvoisie
montmorency
thinks
only
of
the
chase
and
spends
all
his
time
among
his
dogs
and
falcons
the
comte
de
retz
is
a
spaniard
the
de
guises
are
lorraines
i
think
there
are
no
true
frenchmen
in
france
except
myself
my
of
navarre
and
you
but
i
am
chained
to
the
throne
and
can
not
command
armies
it
is
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
hunt
at
my
ease
at
saint
germain
or
rambouillet
my
of
navarre
is
too
young
and
too
inexperienced
besides
he
seems
to
me
exactly
like
his
father
antoine
ruined
by
women
there
is
but
you
my
father
who
can
be
called
at
the
same
time
as
brave
as
cæsar
and
as
wise
as
plato
so
that
i
scarcely
know
what
to
do
keep
you
near
me
as
my
adviser
or
send
you
to
the
army
as
its
general
if
you
act
as
my
counsellor
who
will
command
if
you
command
who
will
be
my
counsellor
sire
said
coligny
we
must
conquer
first
and
then
take
counsel
after
the
victory
that
is
your
advice
so
be
it
monday
you
shall
leave
for
flanders
and
i
for
amboise
your
majesty
leaves
paris
then
yes
i
am
weary
of
this
confusion
and
of
these

i
am
not
a
man
of
action
i
am
a
dreamer
i
was
not
born
to
be
a
king
i
was
born
to
be
a
poet
you
shall
form
a
council
which
shall
govern
while
you
are
at
war
and
provided
my
mother
is
not
in
it
all
will
go
well
i
have
already
sent
word
to
ronsard
to
join
me
and
yonder
we
two
together
far
from
all
tumult
far
from
the
world
far
from
evil
men
under
our
mighty
trees
on
the
banks
of
the
river
with
the
murmur
of
brooks
in
our
ears
will
talk
about
divine
things
the
only
compensation
which
there
is
in
the
world
for
the
affairs
of
men
wait
hear
these
lines
in
which
i
invite
him
to
join
me
i
wrote
them
this
morning
coligny
smiled
charles
ix
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
brow
yellow
and
shining
like
ivory
and
repeated
in
a
kind
of
the
following
couplets
ronsard
i
am
full
sure
that
if
you
see
me
not
your
great
king
voice
by
you
will
shortly
be
forgot
but
as
a
slight
reminder
know
i
still
persevere
in
making
skill
of
poesy
my
sole
endeavor
and
that
is
why
i
send
to
you
this
warm
appeal
to
fill
your
mind
with
new
enthusiastic
zeal
no
longer
then
amuse
yourself
with
home
distractions
past
is
the
time
for
gardening
and
its
attractions
come
follow
with
your
king
who
loves
you
most
of
all
for
that
the
sweet
strong
verses
from
your
lips
do
fall
and
if
ardoise
shall
not
behold
you
shortly
present
a
mighty
quarrel
will
break
out
and
prove
unpleasant
bravo
sire
bravo
cried
coligny
i
am
better
versed
in
matters
of
war
than
in
matters
of
poetry
but
it
seems
to
me
that
those
lines
are
equal
to
the
best
even
written
by
ronsard
or
dorat
or
even
michel
de
chancellor
of
france
ah
my
father
exclaimed
charles
ix
would
what
you
said
were
true
for
the
title
of
poet
you
see
is
what
i
am
ambitious
above
all
things
to
gain
and
as
i
said
a
few
days
ago
to
my
master
in
poetry
art
of
making
verse
if
one
were
criticised
should
ever
be
above
the
art
of
reigning
prized
the
crowns
that
you
and
i
upon
our
brows
are
wearing
i
as
the
king
receive
as
poet
you
are
sharing
your
lofty
soul
enkindled
by
celestial
beams
flames
of
itself
while
mine
with
borrowed
glory
gleams
if
the
gods
i
ask
which
has
the
better
showing
ronsard
is
their
delight
i
but
their
image
glowing
your
lyre
which
ravishes
with
sounds
so
sweet
and
bold
subdues
men
minds
while
i
their
bodies
only
hold
it
makes
you
master
lifts
you
into
lofty
regions
where
even
the
haughty
tyrant
dared
claim
allegiance
sire
said
coligny
i
was
well
aware
that
your
majesty
conversed
with
the
muses
but
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
their
chief
counsellor
after
you
my
father
after
you
and
in
order
that
i
may
not
be
disturbed
in
my
relations
with
them
i
wish
to
put
you
at
the
head
of
everything
so
listen
i
must
now
go
and
reply
to
a
new
madrigal
my
dear
and
illustrious
poet
has
sent
me
i
can
not
therefore
give
you
the
documents
necessary
to
make
you
acquainted
with
the
question
now
debating
between
philip
ii
and
myself
there
is
besides
a
plan
of
the
campaign
drawn
up
by
my
ministers
i
will
find
it
all
for
you
and
give
it
to
you
at
what
time
sire
at
ten
and
if
by
chance
i
am
busy
making
verses
or
in
my
cabinet
writing
well
you
will
come
in
just
the
same
and
take
all
the
papers
which
you
will
find
on
the
table
in
this
red
portfolio
the
color
is
remarkable
and
you
can
not
mistake
it
i
am
now
going
to
write
to
ronsard
adieu
sire
adieu
my
father
your
hand
what
my
hand
in
my
arms
in
my
heart
there
is
your
place
come
my
old
soldier
come
and
charles
drawing
coligny
toward
him
as
he
bowed
pressed
his
lips
to
his
white
hair
the
admiral
left
the
room
wiping
away
a
tear
charles
ix
followed
him
with
his
eyes
as
long
as
he
could
see
and
listened
as
long
as
he
could
catch
a
sound
then
when
he
could
no
longer
hear
or
see
anything
he
bent
his
head
over
toward
his
shoulder
as
his
custom
was
and
slowly
entered
his
armory
this
armory
was
the
king
favorite
apartment
there
he
took
his
with
pompée
and
his
poetry
lessons
with
ronsard
he
had
gathered
there
a
great
collection
of
the
most
costly
weapons
he
had
been
able
to
find
the
walls
were
hung
with
axes
shields
spears
halberds
pistols
and
muskets
and
that
day
a
famous
armorer
had
brought
him
a
magnificent
arquebuse
on
the
barrel
of
which
were
inlaid
in
silver
these
four
lines
composed
by
the
royal
poet
himself
maintenir
la
foy
suis
belle
et
ennemis
du
roi
suis
belle
et
charles
as
we
have
said
entered
this
room
and
after
having
shut
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
he
raised
the
tapestry
that
masked
a
passage
leading
into
a
little
chamber
where
a
woman
kneeling
before
a
was
saying
her
prayers
as
this
movement
was
executed
noiselessly
and
the
footsteps
of
the
king
deadened
by
the
thick
carpet
made
no
more
noise
than
a
phantom
the
kneeling
woman
heard
no
sound
and
continued
to
pray
charles
stood
for
a
moment
pensively
looking
at
her
she
was
a
woman
of
or
years
of
age
whose
vigorous
beauty
was
set
off
by
the
costume
of
the
peasants
of
caux
she
wore
the
high
cap
so
much
the
fashion
at
the
court
of
france
during
the
time
of
isabel
of
bavaria
and
her
red
bodice
was
embroidered
with
gold
like
those
of
the
of
nettuno
and
sora
the
apartment
which
she
had
for
nearly
twenty
years
occupied
was
close
to
the
and
presented
a
singular
mixture
of
elegance
and
rusticity
in
equal
measure
the
palace
had
encroached
upon
the
cottage
and
the
cottage
upon
the
palace
so
that
the
room
combined
the
simplicity
of
the
peasant
woman
and
the
luxury
of
the
court
lady
the
on
which
she
knelt
was
of
oak
marvellously
carved
covered
with
velvet
and
with
gold
fringes
while
the
bible
from
which
she
was
reading
for
she
was
of
the
reformed
religion
was
very
old
and
torn
like
those
found
in
the
poorest
cottages
now
everything
in
the
room
was
typified
by
the
and
the
bible
eh
madelon
said
the
king
the
kneeling
woman
lifted
her
head
smilingly
at
the
voice
and
rising
from
her
knees
ah
it
is
you
my
son
said
she
yes
nurse
come
here
charles
ix
let
fall
the
curtain
and
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
an
the
nurse
appeared
what
do
you
want
with
me
charlot
come
near
and
answer
in
a
low
tone
the
nurse
approached
him
with
a
familiarity
such
as
might
come
from
that
maternal
affection
felt
by
a
woman
for
her
nursling
but
attributed
by
the
pamphlets
of
the
time
to
a
source
infinitely
less
pure
here
i
am
said
she
speak
is
the
man
i
sent
for
come
he
has
been
here
half
an
hour
charles
rose
approached
the
window
looked
to
assure
himself
there
were
no
eavesdroppers
went
to
the
door
and
looked
out
there
also
shook
the
dust
from
his
trophies
of
arms
patted
a
large
greyhound
which
followed
him
wherever
he
went
stopping
when
he
stopped
and
moving
when
he
moved
then
returning
to
his
nurse
very
well
nurse
let
him
come
in
said
he
the
worthy
woman
disappeared
by
the
same
passage
by
which
she
had
entered
while
the
king
went
and
leaned
against
a
table
on
which
were
scattered
arms
of
every
kind
scarcely
had
he
done
so
when
the
portière
was
again
lifted
and
the
person
whom
he
expected
entered
he
was
a
man
of
about
forty
his
eyes
gray
and
false
his
nose
curved
like
the
beak
of
a
his
prominent
his
face
tried
to
look
respectful
but
all
that
he
could
do
was
to
wear
a
hypocritical
smile
on
his
lips
blanched
with
fear
charles
gently
put
his
hand
behind
him
and
grasped
the
butt
of
a
pistol
of
a
new
construction
that
was
discharged
not
by
a
match
as
formerly
but
by
a
flint
brought
in
contact
with
a
wheel
of
steel
he
fixed
his
dull
eyes
steadily
on
the
newcomer
meantime
he
whistled
with
perfect
precision
and
with
remarkable
sweetness
one
of
his
favorite
after
a
pause
of
some
minutes
during
which
the
expression
of
the
stranger
face
grew
more
and
more
discomposed
you
are
the
person
said
the
king
called
françois
de
louvièrs
maurevel
yes
sire
captain
of
petardeers
yes
sire
i
wanted
to
see
you
maurevel
made
a
low
bow
you
know
continued
charles
laying
a
stress
on
each
word
that
i
love
all
my
subjects
equally
i
know
stammered
maurevel
that
your
majesty
is
the
father
of
your
people
and
that
the
huguenots
and
catholics
are
equally
my
children
maurevel
remained
silent
but
his
agitation
was
manifest
to
the
piercing
eyes
although
the
person
whom
he
was
addressing
was
almost
concealed
in
the
darkness
does
this
displease
you
said
the
king
you
who
have
waged
such
a
bitter
war
on
the
huguenots
maurevel
fell
on
his
knees
sire
stammered
he
believe
that
i
believe
continued
charles
looking
more
and
more
keenly
at
maurevel
while
his
eyes
which
at
first
had
seemed
like
glass
now
became
almost
fiery
i
believe
that
you
had
a
great
desire
at
moncontour
to
kill
the
admiral
who
has
just
left
me
i
believe
you
missed
your
aim
and
that
then
you
entered
the
army
of
my
brother
the
duc
i
believe
that
then
you
went
for
a
second
time
over
to
the
prince
and
there
took
service
in
the
company
of
de
mouy
de
saint
phale
oh
sire
a
brave
gentleman
from
picardy
sire
sire
cried
maurevel
do
not
overwhelm
me
he
was
a
brave
officer
continued
charles
whose
features
assumed
an
aspect
of
almost
ferocious
cruelty
who
received
you
as
if
you
had
been
his
son
fed
you
lodged
you
and
clothed
you
maurevel
uttered
a
despairing
sigh
you
called
him
your
father
i
believe
continued
the
king
pitilessly
and
a
tender
friendship
existed
between
you
and
the
young
de
mouy
his
son
maurevel
still
on
his
knees
bowed
low
more
and
more
crushed
under
the
indignation
of
the
king
who
stood
immovable
like
a
statue
whose
lips
only
are
endowed
with
vitality
by
the
way
continued
the
king
de
guise
was
to
give
you
ten
thousand
crowns
if
you
killed
the
admiral
was
he
not
the
assassin
in
consternation
struck
his
forehead
against
the
floor
as
regards
your
worthy
father
the
sieur
de
mouy
you
were
one
day
acting
as
his
escort
in
a
reconnaissance
toward
chevreux
he
dropped
his
whip
and
dismounted
to
pick
it
up
you
were
alone
with
him
you
took
a
pistol
from
your
holster
and
while
he
was
bending
over
you
shot
him
in
the
back
then
seeing
he
was
dead
for
you
killed
him
on
the
spot
you
escaped
on
the
horse
he
had
given
you
this
is
your
history
i
believe
and
as
maurevel
remained
mute
under
this
accusation
every
circumstance
of
which
was
true
charles
ix
began
to
whistle
again
with
the
same
precision
and
melody
the
same
now
then
murderer
said
he
after
a
little
do
you
know
i
have
a
great
mind
to
have
you
hanged
oh
your
majesty
cried
maurevel
young
de
mouy
entreated
me
to
do
so
only
yesterday
and
i
scarcely
knew
what
answer
to
make
him
for
his
demand
was
perfectly
just
maurevel
clasped
his
hands
all
the
more
just
because
i
am
as
you
say
the
father
of
my
people
and
because
as
i
answered
you
now
that
i
am
reconciled
to
the
huguenots
they
are
as
much
my
children
as
the
catholics
sire
said
maurevel
in
despair
my
life
is
in
your
hands
do
with
it
what
you
will
you
are
quite
right
and
i
would
not
give
a
groat
for
it
but
sire
asked
the
assassin
is
there
no
means
of
redeeming
my
crime
none
that
i
know
of
only
if
i
were
in
your
place
but
thank
god
i
am
not
well
sire
if
you
were
in
my
place
murmured
maurevel
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
king
lips
i
think
i
could
extricate
myself
said
the
king
maurevel
raised
himself
on
one
knee
and
one
hand
fixing
his
eyes
upon
charles
to
make
certain
that
he
was
not
jesting
i
am
very
fond
of
young
de
mouy
said
the
king
but
i
am
equally
fond
of
my
cousin
de
guise
and
if
my
cousin
asked
me
to
spare
a
man
that
the
other
wanted
me
to
hang
i
confess
i
should
be
embarrassed
but
for
policy
as
well
as
religion
sake
i
should
comply
with
my
cousin
de
guise
request
for
de
mouy
brave
captain
though
he
be
is
but
a
petty
personage
compared
with
a
prince
of
lorraine
during
these
words
maurevel
slowly
rose
like
a
man
whose
life
is
saved
in
your
critical
situation
it
would
be
a
very
important
thing
to
gain
my
cousin
de
guise
favor
so
i
am
going
to
tell
you
what
he
said
to
me
last
night
maurevel
drew
nearer
sire
said
he
to
me
every
morning
at
ten
my
deadliest
enemy
passes
down
the
rue
saint
germain
on
his
return
from
the
louvre
i
see
him
from
a
barred
window
in
the
room
of
my
old
preceptor
the
canon
pierre
piles
and
i
pray
the
devil
to
open
the
earth
and
swallow
him
in
its
abysses
now
maître
maurevel
continued
the
king
perhaps
if
you
were
the
devil
or
if
for
an
instant
you
should
take
his
place
that
would
perhaps
please
my
cousin
de
guise
maurevel
infernal
smile
came
back
to
his
lips
though
they
were
still
bloodless
with
terror
and
he
stammered
out
these
words
but
sire
i
can
not
make
the
earth
open
yet
you
made
it
open
wide
enough
for
the
worthy
de
mouy
if
i
remember
correctly
after
this
you
will
tell
me
how
with
a
pistol
have
you
not
that
pistol
still
forgive
me
sire
i
am
a
still
better
marksman
with
an
arquebuse
than
a
pistol
replied
maurevel
now
quite
reassured
pistol
or
arquebuse
makes
no
difference
said
the
king
i
am
sure
my
cousin
de
guise
will
not
cavil
over
the
choice
of
methods
but
said
maurevel
i
must
have
a
weapon
i
can
rely
on
as
perhaps
i
shall
have
to
fire
from
a
long
distance
i
have
ten
arquebuses
in
this
room
replied
charles
with
which
i
can
hit
a
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
paces
will
you
try
one
most
willingly
sire
cried
maurevel
with
the
greatest
joy
going
in
the
direction
of
one
which
was
standing
in
a
corner
of
the
room
it
was
the
one
which
that
day
had
been
brought
to
the
king
no
not
that
one
said
the
king
not
that
one
i
reserve
that
for
myself
some
day
i
am
going
to
have
a
grand
hunt
and
then
i
hope
to
use
it
take
any
other
you
like
maurevel
took
one
down
from
a
trophy
and
who
is
this
enemy
sire
asked
the
assassin
how
should
i
know
replied
charles
withering
the
wretch
with
his
contemptuous
look
i
must
ask
de
guise
then
faltered
maurevel
the
king
shrugged
his
shoulders
do
not
ask
said
he
for
de
guise
will
not
answer
do
people
generally
answer
such
questions
those
that
do
not
wish
to
be
hanged
must
guess
them
but
how
shall
i
know
him
i
tell
you
he
passes
the
canon
house
every
morning
at
ten
but
many
pass
that
house
would
your
majesty
deign
to
give
me
any
certain
sign
oh
that
is

with

his
favorite
air
chapter
iv
the
evening
of
the
of
august
our
readers
have
not
forgotten
that
in
the
previous
chapter
we
mentioned
a
gentleman
named
de
la
mole
whom
henry
of
navarre
was
anxiously
expecting
this
young
gentleman
as
the
admiral
had
announced
entered
paris
by
the
gate
of
saint
marcel
the
evening
of
the
of
august
and
bestowing
a
contemptuous
glance
on
the
numerous
hostelries
that
displayed
their
picturesque
signs
on
either
side
of
him
he
spurred
his
steaming
horse
on
into
the
heart
of
the
city
and
after
having
crossed
the
place
maubert
le
petit
pont
the
pont
and
skirted
the
quays
he
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
rue
de
bresec
which
we
have
since
corrupted
into
the
rue
de
sec
and
for
the
greater
convenience
of
our
readers
we
will
call
by
its
modern
name
the
name
pleased
him
no
doubt
for
he
entered
the
street
and
finding
on
his
left
a
large
plate
swinging
creaking
on
its
hinges
with
an
accompaniment
of
little
bells
he
stopped
and
read
these
words
belle
written
on
a
scroll
beneath
the
sign
which
was
a
most
attractive
one
for
a
famished
traveller
as
it
represented
a
fowl
roasting
in
the
midst
of
a
black
sky
while
a
man
in
a
red
cloak
held
out
his
hands
and
his
purse
toward
this
constellation
here
said
the
gentleman
to
himself
is
an
inn
that
promises
well
and
the
landlord
must
be
a
most
ingenious
fellow
i
have
always
heard
that
the
rue
de
sec
was
near
the
louvre
and
provided
that
the
interior
answers
to
the
exterior
i
shall
be
admirably
lodged
while
the
newcomer
was
thus
indulging
in
this
monologue
another
horseman
who
had
entered
the
street
at
the
other
end
that
is
to
say
by
the
rue
stopped
also
to
admire
the
sign
of
belle
the
gentleman
whom
we
already
know
at
least
by
name
rode
a
white
steed
of
spanish
lineage
and
wore
a
black
doublet
ornamented
with
jet
his
cloak
was
of
dark
violet
velvet
his
boots
were
of
black
leather
and
he
had
a
sword
and
poniard
with
hilts
of
chased
steel
now
if
we
pass
from
his
costume
to
his
features
we
shall
conclude
that
he
was
or
years
of
age
his
complexion
was
dark
his
eyes
were
blue
he
had
a
delicate
mustache
and
brilliant
teeth
which
seemed
to
light
up
his
whole
face
when
his
exquisitely
modelled
lips
parted
in
a
sweet
and
melancholy
smile
the
contrast
between
him
and
the
second
traveller
was
very
striking
beneath
his
cocked
hat
escaped
a
profusion
of
frizzled
hair
red
rather
than
brown
beneath
this
mop
of
hair
sparkled
a
pair
of
gray
eyes
which
at
the
slightest
opposition
grew
so
fierce
that
they
seemed
black
a
fair
complexion
thin
lips
a
tawny
mustache
and
admirable
teeth
completed
the
description
of
his
face
taken
all
in
all
with
his
white
skin
lofty
stature
and
broad
shoulders
he
was
indeed
a
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
term
and
during
the
last
hour
which
he
had
employed
in
staring
up
at
all
the
windows
under
the
pretext
of
looking
for
signs
he
had
attracted
the
general
attention
of
women
while
the
men
though
they
may
have
felt
inclined
to
laugh
at
his
scanty
cloak
his
and
his
boots
checked
their
rising
mirth
with
a
most
cordial
vous
after
they
had
more
attentively
studied
his
face
which
every
moment
assumed
a
dozen
different
expressions
but
never
that
one
characteristic
of
a
bewildered
provincial
he
it
was
who
first
addressed
the
other
gentleman
who
as
i
have
said
was
gazing
at
the
hostelry
of
belle
by
heaven
monsieur
said
he
with
that
horrible
mountain
accent
which
would
instantly
distinguish
a
native
of
piedmont
among
a
hundred
strangers
we
are
close
to
the
louvre
are
we
not
at
all
events
i
think
your
choice
is
the
same
as
mine
and
i
am
highly
flattered
by
it
monsieur
replied
the
other
with
a
provençal
accent
which
rivalled
that
of
his
companion
i
believe
this
inn
is
near
the
louvre
however
i
am
still
deliberating
whether
or
not
i
shall
have
the
honor
of
sharing
your
opinion
i
am
in
a
quandary
you
have
not
yet
decided
sir
nevertheless
the
house
is
attractive
but
perhaps
after
all
i
have
been
won
over
to
it
by
your
presence
yet
you
will
grant
that
is
a
pretty
painting
very
and
it
is
for
that
very
reason
i
mistrust
it
paris
i
am
told
is
full
of
sharpers
and
you
may
be
just
as
well
tricked
by
a
sign
as
by
anything
else
by
heaven
replied
the
piedmontese
i
do
care
a
fig
for
their
tricks
and
if
the
host
does
not
serve
me
a
chicken
as
well
roasted
as
the
one
on
his
sign
i
will
put
him
on
the
spit
nor
will
i
let
him
off
till
i
have
done
him
to
a
turn
come
let
us
go
in
you
have
decided
me
said
the
provençal
laughing
precede
me
i
beg
oh
sir
on
my
soul
i
could
not
think
of
it
for
i
am
only
your
most
obedient
servant
the
comte
annibal
de
coconnas
and
i
monsieur
but
the
comte
joseph
hyacinthe
boniface
de
lerac
de
la
mole
equally
at
your
service
since
that
is
the
case
let
us
go
in
together
arm
in
arm
the
result
of
this
conciliatory
proposition
was
that
the
two
young
men
got
off
their
horses
threw
the
bridles
to
the
ostler
linked
arms
adjusted
their
swords
and
approached
the
door
of
the
inn
where
the
landlord
was
standing
but
contrary
to
the
custom
of
men
of
his
profession
the
worthy
proprietor
seemed
not
to
notice
them
so
busy
was
he
talking
with
a
tall
sallow
man
wrapped
in
a
cloak
like
an
owl
buried
in
his
feathers
the
two
gentlemen
were
so
near
the
landlord
and
his
friend
in
the
cloak
that
coconnas
indignant
that
he
and
his
companion
should
be
treated
with
such
lack
of
consideration
touched
the
landlord
sleeve
he
appeared
suddenly
to
perceive
them
and
dismissed
his
friend
with
an
revoir
come
soon
and
let
me
know
the
hour
appointed
well
le
said
coconnas
do
not
you
see
we
have
business
with
you
i
beg
pardon
gentlemen
said
the
host
i
did
not
see
you
eh
by
heaven
then
you
ought
to
have
seen
us
and
now
that
you
do
see
us
say
le
comte
and
not
merely
if
you
please
la
mole
stood
by
leaving
coconnas
who
seemed
to
have
undertaken
the
affair
to
speak
but
by
the
scowling
on
his
face
it
was
evident
that
he
was
ready
to
come
to
his
assistance
when
the
moment
of
action
should
present
itself
well
what
is
your
pleasure
monsieur
le
comte
asked
the
landlord
in
a
quiet
tone
ah
that
better
is
it
not
said
coconnas
turning
to
la
mole
who
nodded
affirmatively
monsieur
le
comte
and
myself
attracted
by
the
sign
of
your
establishment
wish
to
sup
and
sleep
here
gentlemen
said
the
host
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
have
only
one
chamber
and
i
am
afraid
that
would
not
suit
you
so
much
the
better
said
la
mole
we
will
go
and
lodge
somewhere
else
by
no
means
said
coconnas
i
shall
stay
here
my
horse
is
tired
i
will
have
the
room
since
you
will
not
ah
that
is
quite
different
replied
the
host
with
the
same
cool
tone
of
impertinence
if
there
is
only
one
of
you
i
can
not
lodge
you
at
all
then
by
heaven
cried
coconnas
here
a
witty
animal
just
now
you
could
not
lodge
us
because
we
were
two
and
now
you
have
not
room
for
one
you
will
not
lodge
us
at
all
then
since
you
take
this
high
tone
gentlemen
i
will
answer
you
frankly
answer
then
only
answer
quickly
well
then
i
should
prefer
not
to
have
the
honor
of
lodging
you
at
all
for
what
reason
asked
coconnas
growing
white
with
rage
because
you
have
no
servants
and
for
one
master
room
full
i
should
have
two
servants
rooms
empty
so
that
if
i
let
you
have
the
room
i
run
the
risk
of
not
letting
the
others
monsieur
de
la
mole
said
coconnas
do
you
not
think
we
ought
to
massacre
this
fellow
decidedly
said
la
mole
preparing
himself
together
with
coconnas
to
lay
his
whip
over
the
landlord
back
but
the
landlord
contented
himself
with
retreating
a
step
or
two
despite
this
demonstration
which
was
not
particularly
reassuring
considering
that
the
two
gentlemen
appeared
so
full
of
determination
it
is
easy
to
see
said
he
in
a
tone
of
raillery
that
these
gentlemen
are
just
from
the
provinces
at
paris
it
is
no
longer
the
fashion
to
massacre
innkeepers
who
refuse
to
let
them
rooms
only
great
men
are
massacred
nowadays
and
not
the
common
people
and
if
you
make
any
disturbance
i
will
call
my
neighbors
and
you
shall
be
beaten
yourselves
and
that
would
be
an
indignity
for
two
such
gentlemen
why
he
is
laughing
at
us
cried
coconnas
in
a
rage
grégoire
my
arquebuse
said
the
host
with
the
same
voice
with
which
he
would
have
said
give
these
gentleman
a
chair
del
papa
cried
coconnas
drawing
his
sword
warm
up
monsieur
de
la
mole
no
no
for
while
we
warm
up
our
supper
will
get
cold
what
you
think
cried
coconnas
that
monsieur
de
la
belle
étoile
is
right
only
he
does
not
know
how
to
treat
his
guests
especially
when
they
are
gentlemen
for
instead
of
brutally
saying
i
do
not
want
you
it
would
have
been
better
if
he
had
said
gentlemen
at
the
same
time
reserving
to
himself
the
right
to
charge
in
his
bill
master
room
so
much
servants
room
so
much
with
these
words
la
mole
gently
pushed
by
the
landlord
who
was
just
on
the
point
of
taking
his
arquebuse
and
entered
with
coconnas
well
said
coconnas
i
am
sorry
to
sheathe
my
sword
before
i
have
ascertained
that
it
is
as
sharp
as
that
rascal
patience
my
dear
friend
patience
said
la
mole
all
the
inns
in
paris
are
full
of
gentlemen
come
to
attend
the
king
of
marriage
or
attracted
by
the
approaching
war
with
flanders
we
should
not
find
another
lodging
besides
perhaps
it
is
the
custom
at
paris
to
receive
strangers
in
this
manner
by
heaven
how
patient
you
are
monsieur
de
la
mole
muttered
coconnas
curling
his
red
mustache
with
rage
and
hurling
the
lightning
of
his
eyes
on
the
landlord
but
let
the
scoundrel
take
care
for
if
his
cooking
be
bad
if
his
bed
be
hard
his
wine
less
than
three
years
in
bottle
and
his
waiter
be
not
as
pliant
as
a
reed
there
there
my
dear
gentleman
said
the
landlord
whetting
his
knife
on
a
strap
you
may
make
yourself
easy
you
are
in
the
land
of
cocagne
then
in
a
low
tone
he
added
these
are
some
huguenots
traitors
have
grown
so
insolent
since
the
marriage
of
their
béarnais
with
mademoiselle
margot
then
with
a
smile
that
would
have
made
his
guests
shudder
had
they
seen
it
how
strange
it
would
be
if
i
were
just
to
have
two
huguenots
come
to
my
house
when
now
then
interrupted
coconnas
pointedly
are
we
going
to
have
any
supper
yes
as
soon
as
you
please
monsieur
returned
the
landlord
softened
no
doubt
by
the
last
reflection
well
then
the
sooner
the
better
said
coconnas
and
turning
to
la
mole
pray
monsieur
le
comte
while
they
are
putting
our
room
in
order
tell
me
do
you
think
paris
seems
a
gay
city
faith
no
said
la
mole
all
the
faces
i
have
seen
looked
scared
or
forbidding
perhaps
the
parisians
also
are
afraid
of
the
storm
see
how
very
black
the
sky
is
and
the
air
feels
heavy
tell
me
count
are
you
not
bound
for
the
louvre
yes
and
you
also
monsieur
de
coconnas
well
let
us
go
together
it
is
rather
late
to
go
out
is
it
not
said
la
mole
early
or
late
i
must
go
my
orders
are
peremptory
instantly
to
paris
and
report
to
the
duc
de
guise
without
delay
at
the
duc
de
guise
name
the
landlord
drew
nearer
i
think
the
rascal
is
listening
to
us
said
coconnas
who
as
a
true
son
of
piedmont
was
very
truculent
and
could
not
forgive
the
proprietor
of
belle
his
rude
reception
of
them
i
am
listening
gentlemen
replied
he
taking
off
his
cap
but
it
is
to
serve
you
i
heard
the
great
duke
name
mentioned
and
i
came
immediately
what
can
i
do
for
you
gentlemen
aha
that
name
is
magical
since
it
renders
you
so
polite
tell
me
maître
what
your
name
maître
la
hurière
replied
the
host
bowing
well
maître
la
hurière
do
you
think
my
arm
is
lighter
than
the
duc
de
guise
who
makes
you
so
civil
no
monsieur
le
comte
but
it
is
not
so
long
replied
la
hurière
besides
he
added
i
must
tell
you
that
the
great
henry
is
the
idol
of
us
parisians
which
henry
asked
la
mole
it
seems
to
me
there
is
only
one
replied
the
landlord
you
are
mistaken
there
is
another
whom
i
desire
you
do
not
speak
ill
of
and
that
is
henry
of
navarre
and
then
there
is
henry
de
condé
who
has
his
share
of
merit
i
do
not
know
them
said
the
landlord
but
i
do
and
as
i
am
on
my
way
to
the
king
of
navarre
i
desire
you
not
to
speak
slightingly
of
him
before
me
the
landlord
replied
by
merely
touching
his
cap
and
continued
to
lavish
his
assiduities
on
coconnas
so
monsieur
is
going
to
see
the
great
duc
de
guise
monsieur
is
a
very
fortunate
gentleman
he
has
come
no
doubt
for
what
asked
coconnas
for
the
festivity
replied
the
host
with
a
singular
smile
you
should
say
for
the
festivities
replied
coconnas
for
paris
i
hear
runs
riot
with
festivals
at
least
there
is
nothing
talked
about
but
balls
festivals
and
orgies
does
not
every
one
find
plenty
of
amusement
a
moderate
amount
but
they
will
have
more
soon
i
hope
but
the
marriage
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
navarre
has
brought
a
great
many
people
to
paris
has
it
not
said
la
mole
a
great
many
huguenots
yes
replied
la
hurière
but
suddenly
changing
his
tone
pardon
me
gentlemen
said
he
perhaps
you
are
of
that
religion
i
cried
coconnas
i
am
as
good
a
catholic
as
the
pope
himself
la
hurière
looked
at
la
mole
but
la
mole
did
not
or
would
not
comprehend
him
if
you
do
not
know
the
king
of
navarre
maître
la
hurière
said
la
mole
perhaps
you
know
the
admiral
i
have
heard
he
has
some
influence
at
court
and
as
i
have
letters
for
him
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
where
he
lives
if
his
name
does
not
take
the
skin
off
your
lips
he
live
in
the
rue
de
béthizy
down
here
at
the
right
replied
the
landlord
with
an
inward
satisfaction
he
could
not
conceal
he
live
exclaimed
la
mole
has
he
changed
his
residence
yes
from
this
world
perhaps
what
do
you
mean
cried
both
the
gentlemen
together
the
admiral
removed
from
this
world
what
monsieur
de
coconnas
pursued
the
landlord
with
a
shrewd
smile
are
you
a
friend
of
the
duc
de
guise
and
do
not
know
know
what
that
the
day
before
yesterday
as
the
admiral
was
passing
along
the
place
saint
germain
before
the
house
of
the
canon
pierre
piles
he
was
fired
at
and
killed
said
la
mole
no
he
had
his
arm
broken
and
two
fingers
taken
off
but
it
is
hoped
the
balls
were
poisoned
how
wretch
cried
la
mole
hoped
believed
i
mean
said
the
landlord
winking
at
coconnas
do
not
take
a
word
too
seriously
it
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue
and
maître
la
hurière
turning
his
back
on
la
mole
poked
out
his
tongue
at
coconnas
in
the
most
insulting
way
accompanying
this
action
with
a
meaning
wink
really
said
coconnas
joyfully
really
said
la
mole
with
sorrowful
stupefaction
it
is
just
as
i
have
the
honor
of
telling
you
gentlemen
said
the
landlord
in
that
case
said
la
mole
i
must
go
instantly
to
the
louvre
shall
i
find
the
king
of
navarre
there
most
likely
since
he
lives
there
and
i
said
coconnas
must
also
go
to
the
louvre
shall
i
find
the
duc
de
guise
there
most
likely
for
only
a
moment
ago
i
saw
him
pass
with
two
hundred
gentlemen
come
then
monsieur
de
coconnas
said
la
mole
i
will
follow
you
sir
replied
coconnas
but
your
supper
gentlemen
cried
la
hurière
ah
said
la
mole
i
shall
most
likely
sup
with
the
king
of
navarre
and
i
said
coconnas
with
the
duc
de
guise
and
i
said
the
landlord
after
having
watched
the
two
gentlemen
on
their
way
to
the
louvre
i
will
go
and
burnish
my
sallet
put
a
match
to
my
arquebuse
and
sharpen
my
partisan
for
no
one
knows
what
may
happen
chapter
of
the
louvre
in
particular
and
of
virtue
in
general
the
two
young
men
directed
by
the
first
person
they
met
went
down
the
rue
the
rue
saint
germain
and
soon
found
themselves
before
the
louvre
the
towers
of
which
were
beginning
to
be
lost
in
the
early
shades
of
the
gloaming
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
coconnas
of
la
mole
who
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
old
château
stopped
and
gazed
not
without
awe
on
the
drawbridges
the
narrow
windows
and
the
pointed
belfries
which
suddenly
rose
before
his
vision
i
scarcely
know
said
la
mole
my
heart
beats
strangely
i
am
not
timid
but
somehow
this
old
palace
seems
so
gloomy
and
terrible
well
as
for
me
i
do
know
any
reason
for
it
replied
coconnas
but
i
feel
in
excellent
spirits
my
dress
is
somewhat
disordered
he
went
on
to
say
glancing
at
his
travelling
costume
but
never
mind
it
looks
as
if
i
had
been
riding
besides
my
instructions
commanded
promptness
and
i
shall
be
welcome
because
i
shall
have
obeyed
punctually
the
two
young
men
continued
their
way
each
under
the
influence
of
the
feelings
he
had
expressed
there
was
a
strong
guard
at
the
louvre
and
the
sentinels
were
doubled
our
two
cavaliers
were
somewhat
embarrassed
therefore
but
coconnas
who
had
noticed
that
the
duc
de
guise
name
acted
like
a
talisman
on
the
parisians
approached
a
sentinel
and
making
use
of
the
name
asked
if
by
means
of
it
he
might
not
be
allowed
to
enter
the
name
seemed
to
produce
its
ordinary
effect
upon
the
soldier
nevertheless
he
asked
coconnas
if
he
had
the
countersign
coconnas
was
forced
to
confess
he
had
not
stand
back
then
said
the
soldier
at
this
moment
a
person
who
was
talking
with
the
officer
of
the
guard
and
who
had
overheard
coconnas
ask
leave
to
enter
broke
off
his
conversation
and
came
to
him
vat
do
you
vant
with
monsieur
dee
gouise
asked
he
i
wish
to
see

said
coconnas
smiling
imbossible

but

the

said
the
german
gentleman
holding
out
his
hand
toward
coconnas
who
hesitated
by
heaven
replied
the
piedmontese
distrustful
like
a
i
scarcely

not

honor
of

the
sentinel
his

letter
i

for
it

cried
coconnas
of

i

hesitation
but
fidelity
requires
one
to

coldly
and
derefore
i
gannot

your

and
turning
on
his
heel
he
entered
the
louvre
bidding
coconnas
follow
him
la
mole
was
left
alone
at
this
moment
a
troop
of
cavaliers
about
a
hundred
in
number
came
out
from
the
louvre
by
a
gate
alongside
that
of
which
besme
and
coconnas
had
entered
aha
said
the
sentinel
to
his
comrade
there
are
de
mouy
and
his
huguenots
see
how
joyous
they
all
are
the
king
has
probably
promised
them
to
put
to
death
the
assassin
of
the
admiral
and
as
it
was
he
who
murdered
de
mouy
father
the
son
will
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
excuse

my

interrupted
la

sir
and
that
those
with
him
are
are
heretics
i
said
so
thank
you
said
la
mole
affecting
not
to
notice
the
scornful
word
employed
by
the
sentinel
that
was
all
i
wished
to
know
and
advancing
to
the
chief
of
the
cavaliers
sir
said
he
i
am
told
you
are
de
mouy
yes
sir
returned
the
officer
courteously
your
name
well
known
among
those
of
our
faith
emboldens
me
to
address
you
sir
to
ask
a
special
favor
what
may
that
be
sir
but
first
whom
have
i
the
honor
of
addressing
the
comte
lerac
de
la
mole
the
young
men
bowed
to
each
other
what
can
i
do
for
you
sir
asked
de
mouy
sir
i
am
just
arrived
from
aix
and
bring
a
letter
from
governor
of
provence
this
letter
is
directed
to
the
king
of
navarre
and
contains
important
and
pressing
news
how
can
i
give
it
to
him
how
can
i
enter
the
louvre
nothing
is
easier
than
to
enter
the
louvre
sir
replied
de
mouy
but
i
fear
the
king
of
navarre
will
be
too
busy
to
see
you
at
this
hour
however
if
you
please
i
will
take
you
to
his
apartments
and
then
you
must
manage
for
yourself
a
thousand
thanks
come
then
said
de
mouy
de
mouy
dismounted
threw
the
reins
to
his
lackey
stepped
toward
the
wicket
passed
the
sentinel
conducted
la
mole
into
the
château
and
opening
the
door
leading
to
the
king
apartments
enter
and
inquire
for
yourself
sir
said
he
and
saluting
la
mole
he
retired
la
mole
left
alone
looked
round
the
was
vacant
one
of
the
inner
doors
was
open
he
advanced
a
few
paces
and
found
himself
in
a
passage
he
knocked
and
spoke
but
no
one
answered
the
profoundest
silence
reigned
in
this
part
of
the
louvre
what
was
told
me
about
the
stern
etiquette
of
this
place
said
he
to
himself
one
may
come
and
go
in
this
palace
as
if
it
were
a
public
place
then
he
called
again
but
without
obtaining
any
better
result
than
before
well
let
us
walk
straight
on
thought
he
i
must
meet
some
one
and
he
proceeded
down
the
corridor
which
grew
darker
and
darker
suddenly
the
door
opposite
that
by
which
he
had
entered
opened
and
two
pages
appeared
lighting
a
lady
of
noble
bearing
and
exquisite
beauty
the
glare
of
the
torches
fell
full
on
la
mole
who
stood
motionless
the
lady
stopped
also
what
do
you
want
sir
said
she
in
a
voice
which
fell
upon
his
ears
like
exquisite
music
oh
madame
said
la
mole
casting
down
his
eyes
pardon
me
i
have
just
parted
from
de
mouy
who
was
so
good
as
to
conduct
me
here
and
i
wish
to
see
the
king
of
navarre
his
majesty
is
not
here
sir
he
is
with
his
but
in
his
absence
could
you
not
say
to
the
queen
oh
yes
madame
returned
la
mole
if
i
could
obtain
audience
of
her
you
have
it
already
sir
what
cried
la
mole
i
am
the
queen
of
navarre
la
mole
made
such
a
hasty
movement
of
surprise
and
alarm
that
it
caused
the
queen
to
smile
speak
sir
said
marguerite
but
speak
quickly
for
the
queen
mother
is
waiting
for
me
oh
madame
if
the
queen
mother
is
waiting
for
you
said
la
mole
suffer
me
to
leave
you
for
just
now
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
speak
to
you
i
am
incapable
of
collecting
my
ideas
the
sight
of
you
has
dazzled
me
i
no
longer
think
i
can
only
admire
marguerite
advanced
graciously
toward
the
handsome
young
man
who
without
knowing
it
was
acting
like
a
finished
courtier
recover
yourself
sir
said
she
i
will
wait
and
they
will
wait
for
me
pardon
me
madame
said
la
mole
if
i
did
not
salute
your
majesty
at
first
with
all
the
respect
which
you
have
a
right
to
expect
from
one
of
your
humblest
servants
but
you
took
me
for
one
of
my
ladies
said
marguerite
no
madame
but
for
the
shade
of
the
beautiful
diane
de
poitiers
who
is
said
to
haunt
the
louvre
come
sir
said
marguerite
i
see
you
will
make
your
fortune
at
court
you
said
you
had
a
letter
for
the
king
it
was
not
needed
but
no
matter
where
is
it
i
will
give
it
to
him
only
make
haste
i
beg
of
you
in
a
twinkling
la
mole
threw
open
his
doublet
and
drew
from
his
breast
a
letter
enveloped
in
silk
marguerite
took
the
letter
and
glanced
at
the
writing
are
you
not
monsieur
de
la
mole
asked
she
yes
madame
oh
can
i
hope
my
name
is
known
to
your
majesty
i
have
heard
the
king
my
husband
and
the
duc
my
brother
speak
of
you
i
know
they
expect
you
and
in
her
corsage
glittering
with
embroidery
and
diamonds
she
slipped
the
letter
which
had
just
come
from
the
young
man
doublet
and
was
still
warm
from
the
vital
heat
of
his
body
la
mole
eagerly
watched
marguerite
every
movement
now
sir
said
she
descend
to
the
gallery
below
and
wait
until
some
one
comes
to
you
from
the
king
of
navarre
or
the
duc
one
of
my
pages
will
show
you
the
way
and
marguerite
as
she
said
these
words
went
on
her
way
la
mole
drew
himself
up
close
to
the
wall
but
the
passage
was
so
narrow
and
the
queen
of
navarre
farthingale
was
so
voluminous
that
her
silken
gown
brushed
against
the
young
man
clothes
while
a
penetrating
perfume
hovered
where
she
passed
la
mole
trembled
all
over
and
feeling
that
he
was
in
danger
of
falling
he
tried
to
find
a
support
against
the
wall
marguerite
disappeared
like
a
vision
are
you
coming
sir
asked
the
page
who
was
to
conduct
la
mole
to
the
lower
gallery
oh
yes
yes
cried
la
mole
joyfully
for
as
the
page
led
him
the
same
way
by
which
marguerite
had
gone
he
hoped
that
by
making
haste
he
might
see
her
again
and
in
truth
as
he
reached
the
top
of
the
staircase
he
perceived
her
below
and
whether
she
heard
his
step
or
looked
round
by
chance
marguerite
raised
her
head
and
la
mole
saw
her
a
second
time
oh
said
he
as
he
followed
the
page
she
is
not
a
mortal
she
is
a
goddess
and
as
vergilius
maro
says
vera
incessu
patuit
well
asked
the
page
here
i
am
replied
la
mole
excuse
me
here
i
am
the
page
preceding
la
mole
descended
a
story
lower
opened
one
door
then
another
and
stopping
you
are
to
wait
here
said
he
la
mole
entered
the
gallery
the
door
of
which
closed
after
him
the
gallery
was
vacant
except
for
one
gentleman
who
was
sauntering
up
and
down
and
seemed
also
waiting
for
some
one
the
evening
was
by
this
time
beginning
to
scatter
monstrous
shadows
from
the
depths
of
the
vaulted
ceiling
and
though
the
two
gentlemen
were
not
twenty
paces
apart
it
was
impossible
for
either
to
recognize
the
other
face
la
mole
drew
nearer
by
heaven
muttered
he
as
soon
as
he
was
within
a
few
feet
of
the
other
here
is
monsieur
le
comte
de
coconnas
again
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
coconnas
had
already
turned
and
was
staring
at
la
mole
with
no
less
astonishment
than
the
other
showed
by
heaven
cried
he
the
devil
take
me
but
here
is
monsieur
de
la
mole
what
am
i
doing
swearing
in
the
king
palace
well
never
mind
it
seems
the
king
swears
in
a
different
way
from
mine
and
even
in
churches
here
we
are
at
last
then
in
the
louvre
yes
i
suppose
monsieur
de
besme
introduced
you
oh
he
is
a
charming
german
who
brought
you
in
de
mouy
i
told
you
the
huguenots
had
some
interest
at
court
have
you
seen
monsieur
de
guise
no
not
yet
have
you
obtained
your
audience
with
the
king
of
navarre
no
but
i
soon
shall
i
was
brought
here
and
told
to
wait
ah
you
will
see
there
is
some
great
supper
under
way
and
we
shall
be
placed
side
by
side
what
a
strange
chance
for
two
hours
fortune
has
joined
us
but
what
is
the
matter
you
seem
ill
at
ease
i
exclaimed
la
mole
shivering
for
in
truth
he
was
still
dazzled
by
the
vision
which
had
been
vouchsafed
him
oh
no
but
the
place
in
which
we
are
brings
into
my
mind
a
throng
of
reflections
philosophical
ones
i
suppose
just
the
same
as
it
is
with
me
when
you
came
in
i
was
just
going
over
in
my
mind
all
my
tutor
recommendations
monsieur
le
comte
are
you
acquainted
with
plutarch
certainly
i
am
exclaimed
la
mole
smiling
he
is
one
of
my
favorite
authors
very
well
coconnas
went
on
gravely
this
great
man
does
not
seem
to
me
so
far
wrong
when
he
compares
the
gifts
of
nature
to
brilliant
but
ephemeral
flowers
while
he
regards
virtue
as
a
balsamic
plant
of
imperishable
perfume
and
sovereign
efficacy
for
the
healing
of
wounds
do
you
know
greek
monsieur
de
coconnas
said
la
mole
gazing
keenly
at
his
companion
no
i
do
not
but
my
tutor
did
and
he
strongly
advised
me
when
i
should
be
at
court
to
talk
about
virtue
looks
well
he
said
so
i
assure
you
i
am
well
fortified
with
it
by
the
way
are
you
hungry
no
and
yet
you
seemed
anxious
to
taste
the
broiled
fowl
of
belle
as
for
me
i
am
dying
of
starvation
well
monsieur
de
coconnas
here
is
a
fine
chance
for
you
to
make
use
of
your
arguments
on
virtue
and
to
put
your
admiration
for
plutarch
to
the
proof
for
that
great
writer
says
somewhere
is
good
to
accustom
the
soul
to
pain
and
the
stomach
to
hunger

ah
indeed
so
you
know
greek
exclaimed
coconnas
in
surprise
faith
yes
replied
la
mole
my
tutor
taught
me
by
heaven
count
your
fortune
is
made
if
that
is
so
you
will
compose
poetry
with
charles
ix
and
you
will
talk
greek
with
queen
marguerite
not
to
reckon
that
i
can
still
talk
gascon
with
the
king
of
navarre
added
la
mole
laughing
at
this
moment
the
door
communicating
with
the
king
apartment
opened
a
step
was
heard
and
a
shade
was
seen
approaching
in
the
darkness
this
shade
materialized
into
a
body
this
body
belonged
to
monsieur
de
besme
he
scrutinized
both
gentlemen
so
as
to
pick
out
the
one
he
wanted
and
then
motioned
coconnas
to
follow
him
coconnas
waved
his
hand
to
la
mole
de
besme
conducted
coconnas
to
the
end
of
the
gallery
opened
a
door
and
stood
at
the
head
of
a
staircase
he
looked
cautiously
round
then
up
and
down
monsir

said

said
coconnas
and
saluting
de

he
took
his
departure
asking
himself
what
the
devil
does
he
mean
and
why
should
the
tocsin
be
rung
no
matter
i
persist
in
my
opinion
monsieur
de
besme
is
a
charming
tedesco
why
not
wait
for
the
comte
de
la
mole
ah
faith
no
he
will
probably
be
invited
to
supper
with
the
king
of
navarre
and
coconnas
set
forth
for
the
rue
de
sec
where
the
sign
of
belle
like
a
lodestone
attracted
him
meantime
a
gallery
door
which
led
to
the
king
of
navarre
apartment
opened
and
a
page
approached
monsieur
de
la
mole
you
are
the
comte
de
la
mole
said
he
that
is
my
name
where
do
you
lodge
at
belle
rue
de
sec
good
that
is
close
to
the
louvre
listen
his
majesty
the
king
of
navarre
has
desired
me
to
inform
you
that
he
can
not
at
present
receive
you
perhaps
he
may
send
for
you
but
if
morning
you
have
received
no
word
come
to
the
louvre
but
supposing
the
sentinel
refuse
me
admission
true
the
countersign
is
that
word
will
open
all
doors
to
you
thanks
wait
my
dear
sir
i
am
ordered
to
escort
you
to
the
wicket
gate
for
fear
you
should
get
lost
in
the
louvre
by
the
way
how
about
coconnas
said
la
mole
to
himself
as
soon
as
he
was
fairly
in
the
street
oh
he
will
remain
to
supper
with
the
duc
de
guise
but
as
soon
as
he
entered
maître
la
hurière
the
first
thing
la
mole
saw
was
coconnas
seated
before
a
gigantic
omelet
oho
cried
coconnas
laughing
heartily
i
see
you
have
no
more
dined
with
the
king
of
navarre
than
i
have
supped
with
the
duc
de
guise
faith
no
are
you
hungry
now
i
believe
i
am
in
spite
of
plutarch
count
said
la
mole
laughing
plutarch
says
in
another
place
him
that
hath
share
with
him
that
hath
not
are
you
willing
for
the
love
of
plutarch
to
share
your
omelet
with
me
then
while
we
eat
we
will
converse
on
virtue
oh
faith
not
on
that
subject
cried
coconnas
it
is
all
right
when
one
is
at
the
louvre
and
there
is
danger
of
eavesdroppers
and
stomach
is
empty
sit
down
and
have
something
to
eat
with
me
there
now
i
see
that
fate
has
decidedly
made
us
inseparable
are
you
going
to
sleep
here
i
have
not
the
least
idea
nor
i
either
at
any
rate
i
know
where
i
shall
spend
the
night
where
wherever
you
do
that
is
settled
and
both
burst
out
laughing
and
then
set
to
work
to
do
honor
to
maître
la
hurière
omelet
chapter
vi
the
debt
paid
now
if
the
reader
is
curious
to
know
why
monsieur
de
la
mole
was
not
received
by
the
king
of
navarre
why
monsieur
de
coconnas
was
not
permitted
to
see
monsieur
de
guise
and
lastly
why
instead
of
eating
pheasants
partridges
and
venison
at
the
louvre
both
supped
at
the
hotel
of
the
on
an
omelet
he
must
kindly
accompany
us
to
the
old
palace
of
kings
and
follow
the
queen
marguerite
of
navarre
whom
la
mole
had
lost
from
sight
at
the
entrance
of
the
grand
gallery
while
marguerite
was
descending
the
staircase
the
duke
henry
de
guise
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
the
night
of
her
marriage
was
in
the
closet
to
this
staircase
which
marguerite
was
descending
there
was
an
outlet
to
the
closet
in
which
monsieur
de
guise
was
there
was
a
door
and
this
door
and
this
outlet
both
led
to
a
corridor
which
corridor
led
to
the
apartments
of
the
queen
mother
catharine
de
médicis
catharine
de
médicis
was
alone
seated
near
a
table
with
her
elbow
leaning
on
a
half
open
and
her
head
leaning
on
a
hand
still
remarkably
beautiful
by
reason
of
the
cosmetics
with
which
she
was
supplied
by
the
florentine
réné
who
united
the
double
duty
of
perfumer
and
poisoner
to
the
queen
mother
the
widow
of
henry
ii
was
clothed
in
mourning
which
she
had
not
thrown
off
since
her
husband
death
at
this
period
she
was
about
or
years
of
age
and
owing
to
her
stoutness
and
fair
complexion
she
preserved
much
of
her
early
beauty
her
rooms
like
her
dress
paraded
her
widowhood
everything
in
them
bore
the
impress
of
bereavement
hangings
walls
and
furniture
were
all
in
mourning
only
above
a
kind
of
dais
covering
a
throne
where
at
that
moment
lay
sleeping
the
little
greyhound
presented
to
the
queen
mother
by
her
henry
of
navarre
and
bearing
the
mythological
name
of
phoebe
was
a
painted
rainbow
surrounded
by
that
greek
motto
which
king
françois
had
given
her
pherei
ê
de
kai
which
may
be
translated
brings
light
and
suddenly
and
at
a
moment
when
the
queen
mother
appeared
deeply
plunged
in
some
thought
which
brought
a
smile
to
her
lips
a
man
opened
the
door
raised
the
tapestry
and
showed
his
pale
face
saying
everything
is
going
badly
catharine
raised
her
head
and
recognized
the
duc
de
guise
why
do
you
say
is
going
badly
she
replied
what
do
you
mean
henry
i
mean
that
the
king
is
more
than
ever
taken
with
the
accursed
huguenots
and
if
we
await
his
leave
to
execute
the
great
enterprise
we
shall
wait
a
very
long
time
and
perhaps
forever
tell
me
what
has
happened
said
catharine
still
preserving
the
tranquillity
of
countenance
habitual
to
her
yet
to
which
when
occasion
served
she
could
give
such
different
expressions
why
just
now
for
the
twentieth
time
i
asked
his
majesty
whether
he
would
still
permit
all
those
bravadoes
which
the
gentlemen
of
the
reformed
religion
indulge
in
since
their
admiral
was
wounded
and
what
did
my
son
reply
asked
catharine
he
replied
le
duc
you
must
necessarily
be
suspected
by
the
people
as
the
author
of
the
attempted
assassination
of
my
second
father
the
admiral
defend
yourself
from
the
imputation
as
best
you
may
as
to
me
i
will
defend
myself
properly
if
i
am
insulted
and
then
he
turned
away
to
feed
his
dogs
and
you
made
no
attempt
to
retain
him
certainly
i
did
but
he
replied
to
me
in
that
tone
which
you
so
well
know
and
looking
at
me
with
the
gaze
peculiar
to
him
le
duc
my
dogs
are
hungry
and
they
are
not
men
whom
i
can
keep
waiting
whereupon
i
came
straight
to
you
and
you
have
done
right
said
the
queen
mother
but
what
is
now
to
be
done
try
a
last
effort
and
who
will
try
it
i
will
is
the
king
alone
no
de
tavannes
is
with
him
await
me
here
or
rather
follow
me
at
a
distance
catharine
instantly
rose
and
went
to
the
chamber
where
on
turkey
carpets
and
velvet
cushions
were
the
king
favorite
greyhounds
on
perches
ranged
along
the
wall
were
two
or
three
valuable
falcons
and
a
small
shrike
with
which
charles
ix
amused
himself
in
bringing
down
the
little
birds
in
the
garden
of
the
louvre
and
that
of
the
tuileries
which
they
had
just
begun
building
on
her
way
the
queen
mother
put
on
a
pale
and
anguished
expression
while
down
her
cheeks
rolled
a
last
or
rather
a
first
tear
she
noiselessly
approached
charles
ix
as
he
was
giving
his
dogs
fragments
of
cakes
cut
into
equal
portions
my
son
said
the
queen
with
a
trembling
in
her
voice
so
cleverly
affected
that
the
king
started
what
is
it
madame
said
charles
turning
round
suddenly
my
son
replied
catharine
i
would
ask
your
leave
to
retire
to
one
of
your
châteaux
no
matter
which
so
that
it
be
as
distant
as
possible
from
paris
and
wherefore
madame
inquired
charles
fixing
on
his
mother
that
glassy
eye
which
on
certain
occasions
became
so
penetrating
because
every
day
i
receive
new
insults
from
persons
of
the
new
faith
because
i
hear
that
you
have
been
threatened
by
the
protestants
even
in
your
own
louvre
and
i
do
not
desire
to
be
present
at
such
spectacles
but
then
madame
replied
charles
with
an
expression
full
of
conviction
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
kill
their
admiral
an
infamous
murderer
has
already
assassinated
the
brave
de
mouy
de
ma
mother
there
must
be
justice
in
a
kingdom
oh
be
easy
on
that
head
my
son
said
catharine
they
will
not
fail
justice
for
if
you
should
refuse
it
they
will
still
have
it
in
their
own
way
on
de
guise
on
me
and
yourself
later
oh
madame
said
charles
allowing
a
first
accent
of
doubt
to
show
in
his
voice
do
you
think
so
oh
my
son
replied
catharine
giving
way
entirely
to
the
violence
of
her
thoughts
do
you
not
see
that
it
is
no
longer
a
question
of
françois
de
guise
death
or
the
admiral
of
the
protestant
religion
or
the
catholic
religion
but
simply
of
the
substitution
of
antoine
de
bourbon
son
for
the
son
of
henry
the
second
come
come
mother
you
are
falling
again
into
your
usual
exaggeration
said
the
king
what
then
have
you
in
mind
my
son
to
wait
mother
to
wait
all
human
wisdom
is
in
this
single
word
the
greatest
the
strongest
the
most
skilful
is
he
who
knows
how
to
wait
you
may
wait
then
i
will
not
catharine
made
a
courtesy
and
stepping
towards
the
door
was
about
to
return
to
her
apartment
charles
ix
stopped
her
well
then
really
what
is
best
to
be
done
mother
he
asked
for
above
all
i
am
just
and
i
would
have
every
one
satisfied
with
me
catharine
turned
toward
him
come
count
she
said
to
tavannes
who
was
caressing
the
shrike
tell
the
king
your
opinion
as
to
what
should
be
done
will
your
majesty
permit
me
inquired
the
count
speak
tavannes
speak
what
does
your
majesty
do
when
in
the
chase
the
wounded
boar
turns
on
you
by
heaven
monsieur
i
wait
for
him
with
firm
foot
replied
charles
and
stab
him
in
the
throat
with
my
simply
that
he
may
not
hurt
you
remarked
catharine
and
to
amuse
myself
said
the
king
with
a
sigh
which
indicated
courage
easily
aroused
even
to
ferocity
but
i
should
not
amuse
myself
killing
my
subjects
for
after
all
the
huguenots
are
my
subjects
as
well
as
the
catholics
then
sire
said
catharine
your
subjects
the
huguenots
will
do
like
the
wild
boar
who
escapes
the
spear
thrust
into
his
throat
they
will
bring
down
the
throne
nonsense
do
you
really
think
so
madame
said
charles
with
an
air
which
denoted
that
he
did
not
place
great
faith
in
his
predictions
but
have
you
not
seen
de
mouy
and
his
party
yes
i
have
seen
them
for
i
have
just
left
them
but
what
does
he
ask
for
that
is
not
just
he
has
requested
that
his
father
murderer
and
the
admiral
assassin
be
put
to
death
did
we
not
punish
de
montgommery
for
the
death
of
my
father
and
your
husband
although
that
death
was
a
simple
accident
very
well
sire
said
catharine
piqued
let
us
say
no
more
your
majesty
is
under
the
protection
of
that
god
who
gives
you
strength
wisdom
and
confidence
but
i
a
poor
woman
whom
god
abandons
no
doubt
on
account
of
my
sins
fear
and
yield
and
having
said
this
catharine
again
courteseyed
and
left
the
room
making
a
sign
to
the
duc
de
guise
who
had
at
that
moment
entered
to
remain
in
her
place
and
try
a
last
effort
charles
ix
followed
his
mother
with
his
eye
but
this
time
did
not
recall
her
he
then
began
to
caress
his
dogs
whistling
a
he
suddenly
paused
my
mother
said
he
is
a
royal
spirit
and
has
scruples
really
now
it
is
a
cool
proposal
to
kill
off
some
dozens
of
huguenots
because
they
come
to
demand
justice
is
it
not
their
right
some
dozens
murmured
the
duc
de
guise
ah
are
you
here
sir
said
the
king
pretending
to
see
him
for
the
first
time
yes
some
dozens
a
tolerable
waste
of
life
ah
if
any
one
came
to
me
and
said
you
shall
be
rid
of
all
your
enemies
at
once
and
there
shall
not
remain
one
to
reproach
you
with
the
death
of
the
others
why
then
i
do
not
say
well
sire
tavannes
said
the
king
you
will
tire
margot
put
her
back
on
her
perch
it
is
no
reason
because
she
bears
the
name
of
my
sister
the
queen
of
navarre
that
every
one
should
caress
her
tavannes
put
the
hawk
on
her
perch
and
amused
himself
by
curling
and
uncurling
a
greyhound
ears
but
sire
if
any
one
should
say
to
your
majesty
your
majesty
shall
be
delivered
from
all
your
enemies
and
by
the
intercession
of
what
saint
would
this
miracle
be
wrought
sire
is
the
of
august
and
therefore
it
would
be
by
the
interposition
of
saint
bartholomew
a
worthy
saint
replied
the
king
who
allowed
himself
to
be
skinned
alive
so
much
the
better
the
more
he
suffered
the
more
he
ought
to
have
felt
a
desire
for
vengeance
on
his
executioners
and
will
you
my
cousin
said
the
king
will
you
with
your
pretty
little
sword
slay
ten
thousand
huguenots
between
now
and
ha
ha
ha
de
ma
vie
you
are
very
amusing
monsieur
de
guise
and
the
king
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
but
a
laugh
so
forced
that
the
room
echoed
with
its
sinister
sound
sire
one
word
and
one
only
continued
the
duke
shuddering
in
spite
of
himself
at
the
sound
of
that
laugh
which
had
nothing
human
in
it
one
signal
and
all
is
ready
i
have
the
swiss
and
eleven
hundred
gentlemen
i
have
the
light
horse
and
the
citizens
your
majesty
has
your
guards
your
friends
the
catholic
nobility
we
are
twenty
to
one
well
then
cousin
since
you
are
so
strong
why
the
devil
do
you
come
to
fill
my
ears
with
all
this
act
without
me
act
and
the
king
turned
again
to
his
dogs
then
the
portière
was
raised
and
catharine
reappeared
all
goes
well
she
said
to
the
duke
urge
him
and
he
will
yield
and
the
portière
fell
on
catharine
without
charles
ix
seeing
or
at
least
appearing
to
see
her
but
yet
continued
de
guise
i
must
know
if
in
acting
as
i
desire
i
shall
act
agreeably
to
your
majesty
views
really
cousin
henry
you
put
the
knife
to
my
throat
but
i
shall
live
by
heaven
am
i
not
the
king
no
not
yet
sire
but
if
you
will
you
shall
be
so
ah
what
continued
charles
you
would
kill
the
king
of
navarre
the
prince
de
condé
in
my
louvre
ah
then
he
added
in
a
voice
scarcely
audible
without
the
walls
i
do
not
say
sire
cried
the
duke
they
are
going
out
this
evening
to
join
in
a
revel
with
your
brother
the
duc
tavannes
said
the
king
with
impatience
do
not
you
see
that
you
are
teasing
the
dog
here
actéon
come
and
charles
ix
went
out
without
waiting
to
hear
more
and
tavannes
and
the
duc
de
guise
were
left
almost
as
uncertain
as
before
meantime
another
scene
was
passing
in
catharine
apartment
after
she
had
given
the
duc
de
guise
her
counsel
to
remain
firm
she
returned
to
her
rooms
where
she
found
assembled
the
persons
who
were
usually
present
when
she
went
to
bed
her
face
was
now
as
full
of
joy
as
it
had
been
downcast
when
she
set
out
with
her
most
agreeable
manner
she
dismissed
her
women
one
by
one
and
her
courtiers
and
there
remained
only
madame
marguerite
who
seated
on
a
coffer
near
the
open
window
was
looking
at
the
sky
absorbed
in
thought
two
or
three
times
when
she
thus
found
herself
alone
with
her
daughter
the
queen
mother
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
but
each
time
a
gloomy
thought
withheld
the
words
ready
to
escape
her
lips
suddenly
the
portière
was
raised
and
henry
of
navarre
appeared
the
little
greyhound
which
was
asleep
on
the
throne
leaped
up
and
bounded
towards
him
you
here
my
son
said
catharine
starting
do
you
sup
in
the
louvre
no
madame
replied
henry
we
are
going
into
the
city
with
messieurs
and
de
condé
i
almost
expected
to
find
them
here
paying
their
court
to
you
catharine
smiled
go
gentlemen
go
men
are
so
fortunate
in
being
able
to
go
about
as
they
please
are
they
not
my
daughter
yes
replied
marguerite
liberty
is
so
glorious
so
sweet
a
thing
does
that
imply
that
i
restrict
yours
madame
inquired
henry
bowing
to
his
wife
no
sire
i
do
not
complain
for
myself
but
for
women
in
general
are
you
going
to
see
the
admiral
my
son
asked
catharine
yes
possibly
go
that
will
set
a
good
example
and
you
will
give
me
news
of
him
then
madame
i
will
go
since
you
approve
of
this
step
oh
said
catharine
my
approval
is
nothing
but
who
goes
there
send
him
away
send
him
away
henry
started
to
go
to
the
door
to
carry
out
catharine
order
but
at
the
same
instant
the
portière
was
raised
and
madame
de
sauve
showed
her
blond
head
madame
said
she
it
is
réné
the
perfumer
whom
your
majesty
sent
for
catharine
cast
a
glance
as
quick
as
lightning
at
henry
of
navarre
the
young
prince
turned
slightly
red
and
then
fearfully
pale
indeed
the
name
of
his
mother
assassin
had
been
spoken
he
felt
that
his
face
betrayed
his
emotion
and
he
went
and
leaned
against
the
bar
of
the
window
the
little
greyhound
growled
at
the
same
moment
two
persons
entered
the
one
announced
and
the
other
having
no
need
to
be
so
the
first
was
réné
the
perfumer
who
approached
catharine
with
all
the
servile
obsequiousness
of
florentine
servants
he
held
in
his
hand
a
box
which
he
opened
and
all
the
compartments
were
seen
filled
with
powders
and
flasks
the
second
was
madame
de
lorraine
marguerite
eldest
sister
she
entered
by
a
small
secret
door
which
led
from
the
king
closet
and
all
pale
and
trembling
and
hoping
not
to
be
observed
by
catharine
who
was
examining
with
madame
de
sauve
the
contents
of
the
box
brought
by
rené
seated
herself
beside
marguerite
near
whom
the
king
of
navarre
was
standing
with
his
hand
on
his
brow
like
one
who
tries
to
rouse
himself
from
some
sudden
shock
at
this
instant
catharine
turned
round
daughter
she
said
to
marguerite
you
may
retire
to
your
room
my
son
you
may
go
and
amuse
yourself
in
the
city
marguerite
rose
and
henry
turned
half
round
madame
de
lorraine
seized
marguerite
hand
sister
she
whispered
with
great
quickness
in
the
name
of
the
duc
de
guise
who
now
saves
you
as
you
saved
him
do
not
go
from
here
do
not
go
to
your
apartments
eh
what
say
you
claude
inquired
catharine
turning
round
nothing
mother
you
were
whispering
to
marguerite
simply
to
wish
her
and
convey
a
greeting
to
her
from
the
duchesse
de
nevers
and
where
is
that
fair
duchess
at
her
de
guise
catharine
looked
suspiciously
at
the
women
and
frowning
come
here
claude
said
the
queen
mother
claude
obeyed
and
the
queen
seized
her
hand
what
did
you
say
to
her
indiscreet
girl
that
you
are
she
murmured
squeezing
her
daughter
wrist
until
she
nearly
shrieked
with
pain
madame
said
henry
to
his
wife
having
lost
nothing
of
the
movements
of
the
queen
claude
or
marguerite
madame
will
you
allow
me
the
honor
of
kissing
your
hand
marguerite
extended
her
trembling
hand
what
did
she
say
to
you
whispered
henry
as
he
stooped
to
imprint
a
kiss
on
her
hand
not
to
go
out
in
the
name
of
heaven
do
not
you
go
out
either
this
was
like
a
flash
but
by
its
light
swift
as
it
was
henry
at
once
detected
a
complete
plot
this
is
not
all
added
marguerite
here
is
a
letter
which
a
country
gentleman
brought
monsieur
de
la
mole
yes
thank
you
he
said
taking
the
letter
and
putting
it
under
his
doublet
and
passing
in
front
of
his
bewildered
wife
he
placed
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
florentine
well
maître
réné
he
said
and
how
go
commercial
affairs
pretty
well
monseigneur
pretty
well
replied
the
poisoner
with
his
perfidious
smile
i
should
think
so
said
henry
with
men
who
like
you
supply
all
the
crowned
heads
at
home
and
abroad
except
the
king
of
navarre
replied
the
florentine
impudently
saint
maître
réné
replied
the
king
you
are
right
and
yet
my
poor
mother
who
also
bought
of
you
recommended
you
to
me
with
her
dying
breath
come
to
me
maître
réné
or
day
after
and
bring
your
best
perfumes
that
would
not
be
a
bad
notion
said
catharine
smiling
for
it
is
said
that
i
need
some
perfumery
interrupted
henry
laughing
who
told
you
that
mother
was
it
margot
no
my
son
replied
catharine
it
was
madame
de
sauve
at
this
moment
the
duchesse
de
lorraine
who
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
could
no
longer
contain
herself
burst
into
loud
sobs
henry
did
not
even
turn
toward
her
sister
what
is
the
matter
cried
marguerite
darting
toward
claude
nothing
said
catharine
passing
between
the
two
young
women
nothing
she
has
those
nervous
attacks
for
which
mazille
prescribes
aromatic
preparations
and
again
and
with
still
more
force
than
before
she
pressed
her
eldest
daughter
arm
then
turning
toward
the
youngest
there
margot
she
said
did
you
not
hear
me
request
you
to
retire
to
your
room
if
that
is
not
sufficient
i
command
you
excuse
me
madame
replied
marguerite
trembling
and
pale
i
wish
your
majesty
i
hope
your
wishes
may
be
heard
marguerite
withdrew
staggering
and
in
vain
seeking
to
meet
her
husband
eyes
but
he
did
not
even
turn
toward
her
there
was
a
moment
silence
during
which
catharine
remained
with
her
eyes
fastened
on
the
duchess
of
lorraine
who
without
speaking
looked
at
her
mother
with
clasped
hands
henry
back
was
still
turned
but
he
was
watching
the
scene
in
a
mirror
while
seeming
to
curl
his
mustache
with
a
pomade
which
réné
had
just
given
to
him
and
you
henry
said
catharine
are
you
still
intending
to
go
out
yes
that
true
exclaimed
the
king
faith
i
was
forgetting
that
the
duc
and
the
prince
de
condé
are
waiting
for
me
these
are
admirable
perfumes
they
quite
overpower
one
and
destroy
one
memory
good
evening
madame
good
evening
you
will
perhaps
bring
me
tidings
of
the
admiral
without
fail
well
phoebe
what
is
it
phoebe
said
the
queen
mother
impatiently
call
her
madame
said
the
béarnais
for
she
will
not
allow
me
to
go
out
the
queen
mother
rose
took
the
little
greyhound
by
the
collar
and
held
her
while
henry
left
the
apartment
with
his
features
as
calm
and
smiling
as
if
he
did
not
feel
in
his
heart
that
his
life
was
in
imminent
peril
behind
him
the
little
dog
set
free
by
catharine
de
médicis
rushed
to
try
and
overtake
him
but
the
door
was
closed
and
phoebe
could
only
put
her
long
nose
under
the
tapestry
and
give
a
long
and
mournful
howl
now
charlotte
said
catharine
to
madame
de
sauve
go
and
find
messieurs
de
guise
and
tavannes
who
are
in
my
oratory
and
return
with
them
then
remain
with
the
duchess
of
lorraine
who
has
the
vapors
chapter
vii
the
night
of
the
of
august
when
la
mole
and
coconnas
had
finished
their
supper
and
it
was
meagre
enough
for
the
fowls
of
belle
had
their
pin
feathers
singed
only
on
the
sign
coconnas
whirled
his
chair
around
on
one
leg
stretched
out
his
feet
leaned
one
elbow
on
the
table
and
drinking
a
last
glass
of
wine
said
do
you
mean
to
go
to
bed
instantly
monsieur
de
la
mole
foi
i
am
very
much
inclined
for
it
is
possible
that
i
may
be
called
up
in
the
night
and
i
too
said
coconnas
but
it
appears
to
me
that
under
the
circumstances
instead
of
going
to
bed
and
making
those
wait
who
are
to
come
to
us
we
should
do
better
to
call
for
cards
and
play
a
game
they
would
then
find
us
quite
ready
i
would
willingly
accept
your
proposal
sir
but
i
have
very
little
money
for
play
i
have
scarce
a
hundred
gold
crowns
in
my
valise
for
my
whole
treasure
i
rely
on
that
with
which
to
make
my
fortune
a
hundred
gold
crowns
cried
coconnas
and
you
complain
by
heaven
i
have
but
six
why
replied
la
mole
i
saw
you
draw
from
your
pocket
a
purse
which
appeared
not
only
full
but
i
should
say
bloated
ah
said
coconnas
that
is
to
defray
an
old
debt
which
i
am
compelled
to
pay
to
an
old
friend
of
my
father
whom
i
suspect
to
be
like
yourself
somewhat
of
a
huguenot
yes
there
are
here
a
hundred
rose
nobles
he
added
slapping
his
pocket
but
these
hundred
rose
nobles
belong
to
maître
mercandon
my
personal
patrimony
as
i
tell
you
is
limited
to
six
crowns
how
then
can
you
play
why
it
is
because
of
that
i
wished
to
play
besides
an
idea
occurs
to
me
what
is
it
we
both
came
to
paris
on
the
same
errand
yes
each
of
us
has
a
powerful
protector
yes
you
rely
on
yours
as
i
rely
on
mine
yes
well
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
we
should
play
first
for
our
money
and
afterwards
for
the
first
favor
which
came
to
us
either
from
the
court
or
from
our
mistress
really
a
very
ingenious
idea
said
la
mole
with
a
smile
but
i
confess
i
am
not
such
a
gamester
as
to
risk
my
whole
life
on
a
card
or
a
turn
of
the
dice
for
the
first
favor
which
may
come
either
to
you
or
to
me
will
in
all
probability
involve
our
whole
life
well
let
us
drop
out
of
account
the
first
favor
from
the
court
and
play
for
our
mistress
first
favor
i
see
only
one
objection
to
that
said
la
mole
what
objection
i
have
no
mistress
nor
i
either
but
i
expect
to
have
one
soon
thank
god
we
are
not
cut
out
to
want
one
long
undoubtedly
as
you
say
you
will
have
your
wish
monsieur
de
coconnas
but
as
i
have
not
the
same
confidence
in
my
i
feel
that
it
would
be
robbery
i
to
pit
my
fortune
against
yours
but
if
you
will
let
us
play
until
your
six
crowns
be
lost
or
doubled
and
if
lost
and
you
desire
to
continue
the
game
you
are
a
gentleman
and
your
word
is
as
good
as
gold
well
and
good
cried
coconnas
that
the
talk
you
are
right
sir
a
gentleman
word
is
as
good
as
gold
especially
when
he
has
credit
at
court
thus
believe
me
i
did
not
risk
too
much
when
i
proposed
to
play
for
the
first
favor
we
might
receive
doubtless
and
you
might
lose
it
but
i
could
not
gain
it
for
as
i
am
with
the
king
of
navarre
i
could
not
receive
anything
from
the
duc
de
guise
ah
the
heretic
muttered
the
landlord
as
he
was
at
work
polishing
up
his
old
helmet
i
got
on
the
right
scent
did
i
and
he
stopped
his
work
long
enough
to
cross
himself
piously
well
then
continued
coconnas
shuffling
the
cards
which
the
waiter
had
just
brought
him
you
are
of
the
of
the
what
of
the
new
religion
i
yes
you
well
say
that
i
am
said
la
mole
with
a
smile
have
you
anything
against
us
oh
thank
god
no
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
i
hate
huguenotry
with
all
my
heart
but
i
do
not
hate
the
huguenots
besides
they
are
in
fashion
just
now
yes
replied
la
mole
smiling
to
wit
the
shooting
at
the
admiral
with
an
arquebuse
but
supposing
we
have
a
game
of
arquebusades
anything
you
please
said
coconnas
provided
i
get
to
playing
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
well
let
us
play
then
said
la
mole
picking
up
his
cards
and
arranging
them
in
his
hand
yes
play
ahead
and
with
all
confidence
for
even
if
i
were
to
lose
a
hundred
crowns
of
gold
against
yours
i
shall
have
the
wherewithal
to
pay
you
morning
then
your
fortune
will
come
while
you
are
asleep
no
i
am
going
to
find
it
where
tell
me
and
i
go
with
you
at
the
louvre
are
you
going
back
there
yes
i
have
a
private
audience
with
the
great
duc
de
guise
as
soon
as
coconnas
began
to
speak
about
going
to
seek
his
fortune
at
the
louvre
la
hurière
stopped
polishing
his
sallet
and
went
and
stood
behind
la
mole
chair
so
that
coconnas
alone
could
see
him
and
made
signs
to
him
which
the
piedmontese
absorbed
in
his
game
and
the
conversation
did
not
notice
well
it
is
miraculous
remarked
la
mole
and
you
were
right
when
you
said
that
we
were
born
under
the
same
star
i
have
also
an
appointment
at
the
louvre
but
not
with
the
duc
de
guise
mine
is
with
the
king
of
navarre
have
you
a
yes
a
rallying
sign
no
well
i
have
one
and
my
is
as
the
piedmontese
was
saying
these
words
la
hurière
made
such
an
expressive
gesture
that
the
indiscreet
gentleman
who
happened
at
that
instant
to
raise
his
head
paused
petrified
more
by
the
action
than
by
the
turn
of
the
cards
which
had
just
caused
him
to
lose
three
crowns
la
mole
looked
around
but
saw
only
his
landlord
standing
behind
him
with
folded
arms
and
wearing
on
his
head
the
sallet
which
he
had
seen
him
polishing
the
moment
before
what
is
the
matter
pray
inquired
la
mole
of
coconnas
coconnas
looked
at
the
landlord
and
at
his
companion
without
answering
for
he
could
make
nothing
out
of
maître
la
hurière
redoubled
gestures
la
hurière
saw
that
he
must
go
to
his
aid
it
is
only
that
i
am
very
fond
of
cards
myself
said
he
speaking
rapidly
and
i
came
closer
to
see
the
trick
which
made
you
gain
and
the
gentleman
saw
me
with
my
war
helmet
on
and
as
i
am
only
a
poor
bourgeois
it
surprised
him
you
make
a
fine
figure
indeed
you
do
cried
la
mole
with
a
burst
of
laughter
oh
sir
replied
la
hurière
with
admirably
pretended
good
nature
and
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
expressive
of
his
inferiority
we
poor
fellows
are
not
very
valiant
and
our
appearance
is
not
elegant
it
is
all
right
for
you
fine
gentlemen
to
wear
glittering
helmets
and
carry
keen
rapiers
and
provided
we
mount
guard
strictly
aha
said
la
mole
taking
his
turn
at
shuffling
the
cards
so
you
mount
guard
do
you
mon
dieu
oui
monsieur
le
comte
i
am
sergeant
in
a
company
of
citizen
militia
after
having
said
this
while
la
mole
was
engaged
in
dealing
the
cards
la
hurière
withdrew
putting
his
finger
on
his
lips
as
a
sign
of
discretion
for
coconnas
who
was
more
amazed
than
ever
this
signal
for
caution
was
doubtless
the
reason
that
he
lost
almost
as
rapidly
the
second
time
as
the
first
well
observed
la
mole
this
makes
exactly
your
six
crowns
will
you
have
your
revenge
on
your
future
fortune
willingly
replied
coconnas
but
before
you
begin
did
you
not
say
you
had
an
appointment
with
the
duc
de
guise
coconnas
looked
toward
the
kitchen
and
saw
the
great
eyes
of
la
hurière
who
was
repeating
his
warning
yes
he
replied
but
it
is
not
yet
time
but
now
let
us
talk
a
little
about
yourself
monsieur
de
la
mole
we
should
do
better
i
think
by
talking
of
the
game
my
dear
monsieur
de
coconnas
for
unless
i
am
very
much
mistaken
i
am
in
a
fair
way
of
gaining
six
more
crowns
by
heaven
that
is
true
i
always
heard
that
the
huguenots
had
good
luck
at
cards
devil
take
me
if
i
have
a
good
mind
to
turn
huguenot
la
hurière
eyes
sparkled
like
two
coals
but
coconnas
absorbed
in
his
game
did
not
notice
them
do
so
count
do
so
said
la
mole
and
though
the
way
in
which
the
change
came
about
is
odd
you
will
be
well
received
among
us
coconnas
scratched
his
ear
if
i
were
sure
that
your
good
luck
came
from
that
he
said
i
would
for
i
really
do
not
stickle
so
overwhelmingly
for
the
mass
and
as
the
king
does
not
think
so
much
of
it
either
then
it
is
such
a
beautiful
religion
said
la
mole
so
simple
so
pure
and
moreover
it
is
in
fashion
said
coconnas
and
moreover
it
brings
good
luck
at
cards
for
the
devil
take
me
if
you
do
not
hold
all
the
aces
and
yet
i
have
watched
you
closely
and
you
play
very
fairly
you
do
not
cheat
it
must
be
the
religion
you
owe
me
six
crowns
more
said
la
mole
quietly
ah
how
you
tempt
me
said
coconnas
and
if
i
am
not
satisfied
with
monsieur
de
guise
well
well
i
will
ask
you
to
present
me
to
the
king
of
navarre
and
be
assured
if
once
i
become
a
huguenot
i
will
luther
calvin
melanchthon
and
all
the
reformers
on
earth
hush
said
la
mole
you
will
get
into
a
quarrel
with
our
host
ah
that
is
true
said
coconnas
looking
toward
the
kitchen
but
no
he
is
not
listening
he
is
too
much
occupied
at
this
moment
what
is
he
doing
pray
inquired
la
mole
who
could
not
see
him
from
where
he
was
he
is
talking
with
devil
take
me
it
is
he
who
why
that
with
whom
he
was
discoursing
when
we
arrived
the
man
in
the
yellow
doublet
and
cloak
by
heaven
how
earnestly
he
talks
say
maître
la
hurière
are
you
engaged
in
politics
but
this
time
maître
la
hurière
answer
was
a
gesture
so
energetic
and
imperious
that
in
spite
of
his
love
for
the
picture
card
coconnas
got
up
and
went
to
him
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
la
mole
you
wish
wine
sir
said
la
hurière
seizing
coconnas
hand
eagerly
you
shall
have
it
grégoire
wine
for
these
gentlemen
then
he
whispered
in
his
ear
silence
if
you
value
your
life
silence
and
get
rid
of
your
companion
la
hurière
was
so
pale
the
sallow
man
so
lugubrious
that
coconnas
felt
a
shiver
run
over
him
and
turning
to
la
mole
said
my
dear
sir
i
must
beg
you
to
excuse
me
i
have
lost
fifty
crowns
in
the
turn
of
a
hand
i
am
in
bad
luck
and
i
fear
i
may
get
into
difficulties
well
sir
as
you
please
replied
la
mole
besides
i
shall
not
be
sorry
to
lie
down
for
a
time
maître
la
hurière
monsieur
le
comte
if
any
one
comes
for
me
from
the
king
of
navarre
wake
me
i
shall
be
dressed
and
consequently
ready
so
shall
i
said
coconnas
and
that
i
may
not
keep
his
highness
waiting
i
will
prepare
the
sign
maître
la
hurière
some
white
paper
and
scissors
grégoire
cried
la
hurière
white
paper
to
write
a
letter
on
and
scissors
to
cut
the
envelope
with
ah
said
the
piedmontese
to
himself
something
extraordinary
is
going
on
here
monsieur
de
coconnas
said
la
mole
and
you
landlord
be
so
good
as
to
light
me
to
my
room
good
luck
my
friend
and
la
mole
disappeared
up
the
winding
staircase
followed
by
la
hurière
then
the
mysterious
man
taking
coconnas
by
the
arm
said
to
him
speaking
very
rapidly
sir
you
have
very
nearly
betrayed
a
secret
on
which
depends
the
fate
of
a
kingdom
god
saw
fit
to
have
you
close
your
mouth
in
time
one
word
more
and
i
should
have
brought
you
down
with
my
arquebuse
now
we
are
alone
fortunately
listen
but
who
are
you
that
you
address
me
with
this
tone
of
authority
did
you
ever
hear
talk
of
the
sire
de
maurevel
the
assassin
of
the
admiral
and
of
captain
de
mouy
yes
well
i
am
the
sire
de
maurevel
oho
said
coconnas
now
listen
to
me
by
heaven
i
assure
you
i
will
listen
hush
said
maurevel
putting
his
finger
on
his
mouth
coconnas
listened
at
that
moment
he
heard
the
landlord
close
the
door
of
a
chamber
then
the
door
of
a
corridor
and
bolt
it
then
he
rushed
down
the
stairs
to
join
the
two
speakers
he
offered
a
chair
to
coconnas
a
chair
to
maurevel
and
took
one
for
himself
all
is
safe
now
monsieur
de
maurevel
said
he
you
may
speak
it
was
striking
eleven
at
saint
germain
maurevel
counted
each
of
the
as
they
sounded
clear
and
melancholy
through
the
night
and
when
the
last
echo
had
died
away
in
space
he
turned
to
coconnas
who
was
greatly
mystified
at
seeing
the
precautions
taken
by
the
two
men
sir
he
asked
are
you
a
good
catholic
why
i
think
i
am
replied
coconnas
sir
continued
maurevel
are
you
devoted
to
the
king
heart
and
soul
i
even
feel
that
you
insult
me
sir
in
asking
such
a
question
we
will
not
quarrel
over
that
only
you
are
going
to
follow
us
whither
that
is
of
little
consequence
put
yourself
in
our
hands
your
fortune
and
perhaps
your
life
is
at
stake
i
tell
you
sir
that
at
midnight
i
have
an
appointment
at
the
louvre
that
is
where
we
are
going
monsieur
de
guise
is
expecting
me
there
and
us
also
but
i
have
a
private
continued
coconnas
somewhat
mortified
at
sharing
with
the
sire
de
maurevel
and
maître
la
hurière
the
honor
of
his
audience
so
have
we
but
i
have
a
sign
of
recognition
maurevel
smiled
then
he
drew
from
beneath
his
doublet
a
handful
of
crosses
in
white
stuff
gave
one
to
la
hurière
one
to
coconnas
and
took
another
for
himself
la
hurière
fastened
his
to
his
helmet
maurevel
attached
his
to
the
side
of
his
hat
ah
said
coconnas
amazed
the
appointment
and
the
rallying
were
for
every
one
yes
sir
that
is
to
say
for
all
good
catholics
then
there
is
a
festival
at
the
louvre
some
royal
banquet
is
there
not
said
coconnas
and
it
is
desired
to
exclude
those
hounds
of
huguenots
good
capital
excellent
they
have
been
showing
off
too
long
yes
there
is
to
be
a
festival
at
the
louvre
a
royal
banquet
and
the
huguenots
are
invited
and
moreover
they
will
be
the
heroes
of
the
festival
and
will
pay
for
the
banquet
and
if
you
will
be
one
of
us
we
will
begin
by
going
to
invite
their
principal
champion
their
gideon
as
they
call
him
the
admiral
cried
coconnas
yes
the
old
gaspard
whom
i
missed
like
a
fool
though
i
aimed
at
him
with
the
king
arquebuse
and
this
my
gentleman
is
why
i
was
polishing
my
sallet
sharpening
my
sword
and
putting
an
edge
on
my
knives
said
la
hurière
in
a
harsh
voice
consonant
with
war
at
these
words
coconnas
shuddered
and
turned
very
pale
for
he
began
to
understand
what
really
he
exclaimed
this
festival
this
banquet
is
a
you
are
going
you
have
been
a
long
time
guessing
sir
said
maurevel
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
you
are
not
so
weary
of
these
insolent
heretics
as
we
are
and
you
take
on
yourself
he
said
to
go
to
the
admiral
and
to
maurevel
smiled
and
drawing
coconnas
to
the
window
he
said
look
there
do
you
see
in
the
small
square
at
the
end
of
the
street
behind
the
church
a
troop
drawn
up
noiselessly
in
the
shadow
yes
the
men
forming
that
troop
have
like
maître
la
hurière
and
myself
and
yourself
a
cross
in
their
hats
well
well
these
men
are
a
company
of
swiss
from
the
smaller
cantons
commanded
by
toquenot
you
know
the
men
from
the
smaller
cantons
are
the
king
cronies
oho
said
coconnas
now
look
at
that
troop
of
horse
passing
along
the
quay
do
you
recognize
their
leader
how
can
i
recognize
him
asked
coconnas
with
a
shudder
i
reached
paris
only
this
evening
well
then
he
is
the
one
with
whom
you
have
a
rendezvous
at
the
louvre
at
midnight
see
he
is
going
to
wait
for
you
the
duc
de
guise
himself
his
escorts
are
marcel
the
of
the
tradesmen
and
jean
choron
the
present
provost
these
two
are
going
to
summon
their
companies
and
here
down
this
street
comes
the
captain
of
the
quarter
see
what
he
will
do
he
knocks
at
each
door
but
what
is
there
on
the
doors
at
which
he
knocks
a
white
cross
young
man
such
as
that
which
we
have
in
our
hats
in
days
gone
by
they
let
god
bear
the
burden
of
distinguishing
his
own
now
we
have
grown
more
civilized
and
we
save
him
the
bother
but
at
each
house
at
which
he
knocks
the
door
opens
and
from
each
house
armed
citizens
come
out
he
will
knock
here
in
turn
and
we
shall
in
turn
go
out
what
said
coconnas
every
one
called
out
to
go
and
kill
one
old
huguenot
by
heaven
it
is
shameful
it
is
an
affair
of
and
not
of
soldiers
young
man
replied
maurevel
if
the
old
are
objectionable
to
you
you
may
choose
young
ones
you
will
find
plenty
for
all
tastes
if
you
despise
daggers
use
your
sword
for
the
huguenots
are
not
the
men
to
allow
their
throats
to
be
cut
without
defending
themselves
and
you
know
that
huguenots
young
or
old
are
tough
but
are
they
all
going
to
be
killed
then
cried
coconnas
all
by
the
king
order
by
order
of
the
king
and
monsieur
de
guise
and
when
when
you
hear
the
bell
of
saint
germain
oh

was
why
that
amiable
german
attached
to
the
duc
de
guise

maurevel
carefully
opened
the
window
besme
was
passing
at
the
moment
with
twenty
soldiers
and
lorraine

maurevel

de

went
on
and
maurevel
closed
the
window
did
you
hear
young
man
said
maurevel
if
you
have
any
private
enemy
even
if
he
is
not
altogether
a
huguenot
you
can
put
him
on
your
list
and
he
will
pass
with
the
others
coconnas
more
bewildered
than
ever
with
what
he
saw
and
heard
looked
first
at
his
landlord
who
was
assuming
formidable
attitudes
and
then
at
maurevel
who
quietly
drew
a
paper
from
his
pocket
here
my
list
said
he
three
hundred
let
each
good
catholic
do
this
night
part
of
the
business
i
shall
do
and
there
will
not
remain
one
single
heretic
in
the
kingdom
hush
said
la
hurière
what
is
it
inquired
coconnas
and
maurevel
together
they
heard
the
first
pulsation
from
the
bell
in
saint
germain
the
signal
exclaimed
maurevel
the
time
is
set
forward
i
was
told
it
was
appointed
at
midnight
so
much
the
better
when
it
concerns
the
interest
of
god
and
the
king
it
is
better
for
clocks
to
be
fast
than
slow
in
reality
they
heard
the
church
bell
mournfully
tolling
then
a
shot
was
fired
and
almost
instantly
the
light
of
several
torches
blazed
up
like
flashes
of
lightning
in
the
rue
de
sec
coconnas
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
which
was
damp
with
perspiration
it
has
begun
cried
maurevel
now
to
work
away
one
moment
one
moment
said
the
landlord
before
we
begin
let
us
protect
the
camp
as
we
say
in
the
army
i
do
not
wish
to
have
my
wife
and
children
throats
cut
while
i
am
out
there
is
a
huguenot
here
monsieur
de
la
mole
said
coconnas
starting
yes
the
heretic
has
thrown
himself
into
the
wolf
throat
what
said
coconnas
would
you
attack
your
guest
i
gave
an
extra
edge
to
my
rapier
for
his
special
benefit
oho
said
the
piedmontese
frowning
i
never
yet
killed
anything
but
my
rabbits
ducks
and
chickens
replied
the
worthy
and
i
do
not
know
very
well
how
to
go
to
work
to
kill
a
man
well
i
will
practise
on
him
and
if
i
am
clumsy
no
one
will
be
there
to
laugh
at
me
by
heaven
it
is
hard
said
coconnas
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
my
companion
monsieur
de
la
mole
has
supped
with
me
monsieur
de
la
mole
has
played
with
me
yes
but
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
a
heretic
said
maurevel
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
doomed
and
if
we
do
not
kill
him
others
will
not
to
say
added
the
host
that
he
has
won
fifty
crowns
from
you
true
said
coconnas
but
fairly
i
am
sure
fairly
or
not
you
must
pay
them
while
if
i
kill
him
you
are
quits
come
come
cried
maurevel
make
haste
gentlemen
an
a
a
blow
with
a
mallet
a
stroke
with
any
weapon
you
please
but
get
done
with
it
if
you
wish
to
reach
the
admiral
in
time
to
help
monsieur
de
guise
as
we
promised
coconnas
sighed
i
make
haste
cried
la
hurière
wait
for
me
by
heaven
cried
coconnas
he
will
put
the
poor
fellow
to
great
pain
and
perhaps
rob
him
i
must
be
present
to
finish
him
if
requisite
and
to
prevent
any
one
from
touching
his
money
and
impelled
by
this
happy
thought
coconnas
followed
la
hurière
upstairs
and
soon
overtook
him
for
according
as
the
landlord
went
up
doubtless
as
the
effect
of
reflection
he
slackened
his
pace
as
he
reached
the
door
coconnas
still
following
many
gunshots
were
discharged
in
the
street
instantly
la
mole
was
heard
to
leap
out
of
bed
and
the
flooring
creaked
under
his
feet
muttered
la
hurière
somewhat
disconcerted
that
has
awakened
him
i
think
it
looks
like
it
observed
coconnas
and
he
will
defend
himself
he
is
capable
of
it
suppose
now
maître
la
hurière
he
were
to
kill
you
that
would
be
droll
hum
hum
responded
the
landlord
but
knowing
himself
to
be
armed
with
a
good
arquebuse
he
took
courage
and
dashed
the
door
in
with
a
vigorous
kick
la
mole
without
his
hat
but
dressed
was
entrenched
behind
his
bed
his
sword
between
his
teeth
and
his
pistols
in
his
hands
oho
said
coconnas
his
nostrils
expanding
as
if
he
had
been
a
wild
beast
smelling
blood
this
grows
interesting
maître
la
hurière
forward
ah
you
would
assassinate
me
it
seems
cried
la
mole
with
glaring
eyes
and
it
is
you
wretch
maître
la
hurière
reply
to
this
was
to
take
aim
at
the
young
man
with
his
arquebuse
but
la
mole
was
on
his
guard
and
as
he
fired
fell
on
his
knees
and
the
ball
flew
over
his
head
help
cried
la
mole
help
monsieur
de
coconnas
help
monsieur
de
maurevel
help
cried
la
hurière
foi
monsieur
de
la
mole
replied
coconnas
all
i
can
do
in
this
affair
is
not
to
join
the
attack
against
you
it
seems
all
the
huguenots
are
to
be
put
to
death
in
the
king
name
get
out
of
it
as
well
as
you
can
ah
traitors
assassins
is
it
so
well
then
take
this
and
la
mole
aiming
in
his
turn
fired
one
of
his
pistols
la
hurière
who
had
kept
his
eye
on
him
dodged
to
one
side
but
coconnas
not
anticipating
such
a
reply
stayed
where
he
was
and
the
bullet
grazed
his
shoulder
by
heaven
he
exclaimed
grinding
his
teeth
i
have
it
well
then
let
it
be
we
two
since
you
will
have
it
so
and
drawing
his
rapier
he
rushed
on
la
mole
had
he
been
alone
la
mole
would
doubtless
have
awaited
his
attack
but
coconnas
had
la
hurière
to
aid
him
who
was
reloading
his
gun
and
maurevel
who
responding
to
the
innkeeper
invitation
was
rushing
four
steps
at
a
time
la
mole
therefore
dashed
into
a
small
closet
which
he
bolted
inside
ah
coward
cried
coconnas
furious
and
striking
at
the
door
with
the
pommel
of
his
sword
wait
wait
and
i
will
make
as
many
holes
in
your
body
as
you
have
gained
crowns
of
me
i
came
up
to
prevent
you
from
suffering
oh
i
came
up
to
prevent
you
from
being
robbed
and
you
pay
me
back
by
putting
a
bullet
into
my
shoulder
wait
for
me
coward
wait
while
this
was
going
on
maître
la
hurière
came
up
and
with
one
blow
with
the
of
his
arquebuse
smashed
in
the
door
coconnas
darted
into
the
closet
but
only
bare
walls
met
him
the
closet
was
empty
and
the
window
was
open
he
must
have
jumped
out
said
the
landlord
and
as
we
are
on
the
fourth
story
he
is
surely
dead
or
he
has
escaped
by
the
roof
of
the
next
house
said
coconnas
putting
his
leg
on
the
and
preparing
to
follow
him
over
this
narrow
and
slippery
route
but
maurevel
and
la
hurière
seized
him
and
drew
him
back
into
the
room
are
you
mad
they
both
exclaimed
at
once
you
will
kill
yourself
bah
said
coconnas
i
am
a
mountaineer
and
used
to
climbing
glaciers
besides
when
a
man
has
once
offended
me
i
would
go
up
to
heaven
or
descend
to
hell
with
him
by
whatever
route
he
pleases
let
me
do
as
i
wish
well
said
maurevel
he
is
either
dead
or
a
long
way
off
by
this
time
come
with
us
and
if
he
escape
you
you
will
find
a
thousand
others
to
take
his
place
you
are
right
cried
coconnas
death
to
the
huguenots
i
want
revenge
and
the
sooner
the
better
and
the
three
rushed
down
the
staircase
like
an
avalanche
to
the
admiral
shouted
maurevel
to
the
admiral
echoed
la
hurière
to
the
admiral
then
if
it
must
be
so
cried
coconnas
in
his
turn
and
all
three
leaving
the
in
charge
of
grégoire
and
the
other
waiters
hastened
toward
the
admiral
hôtel
in
the
rue
de
béthizy
a
bright
light
and
the
report
of
guided
them
in
that
direction
ah
who
comes
here
cried
coconnas
a
man
without
his
doublet
or
scarf
it
is
some
one
escaping
said
maurevel
fire
fire
said
coconnas
you
who
have
arquebuses
faith
not
i
replied
maurevel
i
keep
my
powder
for
better
game
you
then
la
hurière
wait
wait
said
the
innkeeper
taking
aim
oh
yes
wait
cried
coconnas
and
meantime
he
will
escape
and
he
rushed
after
the
unhappy
wretch
whom
he
soon
overtook
as
he
was
wounded
but
at
the
moment
when
in
order
that
he
might
not
strike
him
behind
he
exclaimed
turn
will
you
turn
the
report
of
an
arquebuse
was
heard
a
bullet
whistled
by
coconnas
ears
and
the
fugitive
rolled
over
like
a
hare
in
its
swiftest
flight
struck
by
the
shot
of
the
sportsman
a
cry
of
triumph
was
heard
behind
coconnas
the
piedmontese
turned
round
and
saw
la
hurière
brandishing
his
weapon
ah
he
exclaimed
i
have
handselled
this
time
at
any
rate
and
only
just
missed
making
a
hole
quite
through
me
be
on
your
guard
be
on
your
guard
cried
la
hurière
coconnas
sprung
back
the
wounded
man
had
risen
on
his
knee
and
eager
for
revenge
was
just
on
the
point
of
stabbing
him
with
his
poniard
when
the
landlord
warning
put
the
piedmontese
on
his
guard
ah
viper
shouted
coconnas
and
rushing
at
the
wounded
man
he
thrust
his
sword
through
him
three
times
up
to
the
hilt
and
now
cried
he
leaving
the
huguenot
in
the
agonies
of
death
to
the
admiral
to
the
admiral
aha
my
gentlemen
said
maurevel
it
seems
to
work
faith
yes
replied
coconnas
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
the
smell
of
gunpowder
makes
me
drunk
or
the
sight
of
blood
excites
me
but
by
heaven
i
am
thirsty
for
slaughter
it
is
like
a
battue
of
men
i
have
as
yet
only
had
battues
of
bears
and
wolves
and
on
my
honor
a
battue
of
men
seems
more
amusing
and
the
three
went
on
their
way
chapter
viii
the
massacre
the
hôtel
occupied
by
the
admiral
as
we
have
said
was
situated
in
the
rue
de
béthizy
it
was
a
great
mansion
at
the
rear
of
a
court
and
had
two
wings
giving
on
the
street
a
wall
furnished
with
a
large
gate
and
two
small
grilled
doors
stretched
from
wing
to
wing
when
our
three
guisards
reached
the
end
of
the
rue
de
béthizy
which
is
a
continuation
of
the
rue
des
fossés
saint
germain
they
saw
the
hôtel
surrounded
by
swiss
by
soldiers
and
by
armed
citizens
every
one
had
in
his
right
hand
either
a
sword
or
a
pike
or
an
arquebuse
and
some
held
in
their
left
hands
torches
shedding
over
the
scene
a
fitful
and
melancholy
glare
which
according
as
the
throng
moved
shifted
along
the
street
climbed
the
walls
or
spread
over
that
living
sea
where
every
weapon
cast
its
answering
flash
all
around
the
hôtel
and
in
the
rues
tirechappe
étienne
and
bertin
poirée
the
terrible
work
was
proceeding
long
shouts
were
heard
there
was
an
incessant
rattle
of
musketry
and
from
time
to
time
some
wretch
half
naked
pale
and
drenched
in
blood
leaped
like
a
hunted
stag
into
the
circle
of
lugubrious
light
where
a
host
of
fiends
seemed
to
be
at
work
in
an
instant
coconnas
maurevel
and
la
hurière
accredited
by
their
white
crosses
and
received
with
cries
of
welcome
were
in
the
thickest
of
this
struggling
panting
mob
doubtless
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
advance
had
not
some
of
the
throng
recognized
maurevel
and
made
way
for
him
coconnas
and
la
hurière
followed
him
closely
and
the
three
therefore
contrived
to
get
into
the
in
the
centre
of
this
the
three
doors
of
which
had
been
burst
open
a
man
around
whom
the
assassins
formed
a
respectful
circle
stood
leaning
on
his
drawn
rapier
and
eagerly
looking
up
at
a
balcony
about
fifteen
feet
above
him
and
extending
in
front
of
the
principal
window
of
the
hôtel
this
man
stamped
impatiently
on
the
ground
and
from
time
to
time
questioned
those
that
were
nearest
to
him
nothing
yet
murmured
he
no
one
he
must
have
been
warned
and
has
escaped
what
do
you
think
du
gast
impossible
monseigneur
why
did
you
not
tell
me
that
just
before
we
arrived
a
man
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
came
running
as
if
pursued
knocked
at
the
door
and
was
admitted
yes
monseigneur
but
de
besme
came
up
immediately
the
gates
were
shattered
and
the
hôtel
was
surrounded
the
man
went
in
sure
enough
but
he
has
not
gone
out
why
said
coconnas
to
la
hurière
if
my
eyes
do
not
deceive
me
i
see
monsieur
de
guise
you
do
see
him
sir
yes
the
great
henry
de
guise
is
come
in
person
to
watch
for
the
admiral
and
serve
him
as
he
served
the
duke
father
every
one
has
his
day
and
it
is
our
turn
now
holà
besme
holà
cried
the
duke
in
his
powerful
voice
have
you
not
finished
yet
and
he
struck
his
sword
so
forcibly
against
the
stones
that
sparks
flew
out
at
this
instant
shouts
were
heard
in
the
hôtel
then
several
shots
then
a
great
shuffling
of
feet
and
a
clashing
of
swords
and
then
all
was
again
silent
the
duke
was
about
to
rush
into
the
house
monseigneur
monseigneur
said
du
gast
detaining
him
your
dignity
commands
you
to
wait
here
you
are
right
du
gast
i
must
stay
here
but
i
am
dying
with
impatience
and
anxiety
if
he
were
to
escape
me
suddenly
the
noise
of
feet
came
nearer
the
windows
of
the
first
floor
were
lighted
up
with
what
seemed
the
reflection
of
a
conflagration
the
window
to
which
the
duke
eyes
had
been
so
many
times
lifted
opened
or
rather
was
shattered
to
pieces
and
a
man
his
pale
face
and
white
neck
stained
with
blood
appeared
on
the
balcony
ah
at
last
besme
cried
the
duke
speak
speak
louk
louk
replied
the
german
coldly
and
stooping
down
he
lifted
up
something
which
seemed
like
a
heavy
body
but
where
are
the
others
asked
the
duke
impatiently
where
are
the
others
de
udders
are
vinishing
de
udders
and
what
have
you
done
vait
you
shall
peholt
shtant
pack
a
liddle
the
duke
fell
back
a
step
at
that
instant
the
object
besme
was
dragging
toward
him
with
such
effort
became
visible
it
was
the
body
of
an
old
man
he
lifted
it
above
the
balcony
held
it
suspended
an
instant
and
then
flung
it
down
at
his
master
feet
the
heavy
thud
the
billows
of
blood
spurting
from
the
body
and
spattering
the
pavement
all
around
filled
even
the
duke
himself
with
horror
but
this
feeling
lasted
only
an
instant
and
curiosity
caused
every
one
to
crowd
forward
so
that
the
glare
of
the
torches
flickered
on
the
victim
body
they
could
see
a
white
beard
a
venerable
face
and
limbs
contracted
by
death
the
admiral
cried
twenty
voices
as
instantaneously
hushed
yes
the
admiral
here
he
is
said
the
duke
approaching
the
corpse
and
contemplating
it
with
silent
ecstasy
the
admiral
the
admiral
repeated
the
witnesses
of
this
terrible
scene
crowding
together
and
timidly
approaching
the
old
man
majestic
even
in
death
ah
at
last
gaspard
said
the
duke
de
guise
triumphantly
murderer
of
my
father
thus
do
i
avenge
him
and
the
duke
dared
to
plant
his
foot
on
the
breast
of
the
protestant
hero
but
instantly
the
dying
warrior
opened
his
eyes
his
bleeding
and
mutilated
hand
was
clinched
for
the
last
time
and
the
admiral
though
without
stirring
said
to
the
duke
in
a
sepulchral
voice
henry
de
guise
some
day
the
assassin
foot
shall
be
felt
on
your
breast
i
did
not
kill
your
father
a
curse
upon
you
the
duke
pale
and
trembling
in
spite
of
himself
felt
a
cold
shudder
come
over
him
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
brow
as
if
to
dispel
the
fearful
vision
when
he
dared
again
to
glance
at
the
admiral
his
eyes
were
closed
his
hand
unclinched
and
a
stream
of
black
blood
was
flowing
from
the
mouth
which
had
just
pronounced
such
terrible
words
the
duke
raised
his
sword
with
a
gesture
of
desperate
resolution
vell
monsir
are
you
gondent
yes
my
worthy
friend
yes
for
you
have
revenged
the
dugue
françois
haf
i
not

religion
replied
henry
in
a
solemn
voice
and
now
he
went
on
addressing
the
swiss
the
soldiers
and
citizens
who
filled
the
court
and
street
to
work
my
friends
to
work
good
evening
de
besme
said
coconnas
with
a
sort
of
admiration
approaching
the
german
who
still
stood
on
the
balcony
calmly
wiping
his
sword
so
you
settled
him
did
you
cried
la

now
i
hear
his
gries
at
that
instant
in
fact
several
shrieks
apparently
uttered
by
a
woman
in
distress
were
heard
the
windows
of
the
long
gallery
which
formed
a
wing
of
the
hotel
were
lighted
up
with
a
red
glare
two
men
were
seen
fleeing
pursued
by
a
long
line
of
assassins
an
killed
one
the
other
finding
an
open
window
directly
in
his
way
without
stopping
to
look
at
the
distance
from
the
ground
sprang
boldly
into
the
courtyard
below
heeding
not
the
enemies
who
awaited
him
there
kill
kill
cried
the
assassins
seeing
their
prey
about
to
escape
them
the
fugitive
picked
up
his
sword
which
as
he
stumbled
had
fallen
from
his
hand
dashed
headlong
through
the
soldiers
upset
three
or
four
ran
one
through
the
body
and
amid
the
and
curses
of
the
soldiers
rendered
furious
because
they
had
missed
him
darted
like
lightning
in
front
of
coconnas
who
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
gate
with
his
poniard
in
his
hand
touched
cried
the
piedmontese
piercing
his
arm
with
his
keen
delicate
blade
coward
replied
the
fugitive
striking
his
enemy
in
the
face
with
the
flat
of
his
weapon
for
want
of
room
to
thrust
at
him
with
its
point
a
thousand
devils
cried
coconnas
it
monsieur
de
la
mole
monsieur
de
la
mole
reëchoed
la
hurière
and
maurevel
he
is
the
one
who
warned
the
admiral
cried
several
soldiers
kill
him
kill
him
was
shouted
on
all
sides
coconnas
la
hurière
and
a
dozen
soldiers
rushed
in
pursuit
of
la
mole
who
covered
with
blood
and
having
attained
that
state
of
exaltation
which
is
the
last
resource
of
human
strength
dashed
through
the
streets
with
no
other
guide
than
instinct
behind
him
the
footsteps
and
shouts
of
his
enemies
spurred
him
on
and
seemed
to
give
him
wings
occasionally
a
bullet
would
whistle
by
his
ears
and
suddenly
add
new
swiftness
to
his
flight
just
as
it
was
beginning
to
slacken
he
no
longer
breathed
it
was
not
breath
but
a
dull
rattle
a
hoarse
panting
that
came
from
his
chest
perspiration
and
blood
wet
his
locks
and
ran
together
down
his
face
his
doublet
soon
became
too
oppressive
for
the
beating
of
his
heart
and
he
tore
it
off
soon
his
sword
became
too
heavy
for
his
hand
and
he
flung
it
far
away
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
footsteps
of
his
pursuers
were
farther
off
and
that
he
was
about
to
escape
them
but
in
response
to
their
shouts
other
murderers
who
were
along
his
path
and
nearer
to
him
left
off
their
bloody
occupations
and
started
in
pursuit
of
him
suddenly
he
caught
sight
of
the
river
flowing
silently
at
his
left
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
should
feel
like
a
stag
at
bay
an
ineffable
pleasure
in
plunging
into
it
and
only
the
supreme
power
of
reason
could
restrain
him
on
his
right
was
the
louvre
dark
and
motionless
but
full
of
strange
and
ominous
sounds
soldiers
on
the
drawbridge
came
and
went
and
helmets
and
cuirasses
glittered
in
the
moonlight
la
mole
thought
of
the
king
of
navarre
as
he
had
before
thought
of
coligny
they
were
his
only
protectors
he
collected
all
his
strength
and
inwardly
vowing
to
abjure
his
faith
should
he
escape
the
massacre
by
making
a
detour
of
a
score
or
two
of
yards
he
misled
the
mob
pursuing
him
darted
straight
for
the
louvre
leaped
upon
the
drawbridge
among
the
soldiers
received
another
poniard
stab
which
grazed
his
side
and
despite
the
cries
of
kill
kill
which
resounded
on
all
sides
and
the
opposing
weapons
of
the
sentinels
darted
like
an
arrow
through
the
court
into
the
vestibule
mounted
the
staircase
then
up
two
stories
higher
recognized
a
door
and
leaning
against
it
struck
it
violently
with
his
hands
and
feet
who
is
there
asked
a
woman
voice
oh
my
god
murmured
la
mole
they
are
coming
i
hear
them
is
i
is
i
who
are
you
said
the
voice
la
mole
recollected
the
navarre
navarre
cried
he
the
door
instantly
opened
la
mole
without
thanking
without
even
seeing
gillonne
dashed
into
the
vestibule
then
along
a
corridor
through
two
or
three
chambers
until
at
last
he
entered
a
room
lighted
by
a
lamp
suspended
from
the
ceiling
behind
curtains
of
velvet
with
gold
in
a
bed
of
carved
oak
a
lady
half
naked
leaning
on
her
arm
stared
at
him
with
eyes
wide
open
with
terror
la
mole
sprang
toward
her
madame
cried
he
they
are
killing
they
are
butchering
my
brothers
they
seek
to
kill
me
to
butcher
me
also
ah
you
are
the
queen
save
me
and
he
threw
himself
at
her
feet
leaving
on
the
carpet
a
large
track
of
blood
at
the
sight
of
a
man
pale
exhausted
and
bleeding
at
her
feet
the
queen
of
navarre
started
up
in
terror
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
called
for
help
madame
cried
la
mole
endeavoring
to
rise
in
the
name
of
heaven
do
not
call
for
if
you
are
heard
i
am
lost
assassins
are
in
my
track
they
are
rushing
up
the
stairs
behind
me
i
hear
them
there
they
are
there
they
are
help
cried
the
queen
beside
herself
help
ah
said
la
mole
despairingly
you
have
killed
me
to
die
by
so
sweet
a
voice
so
fair
a
hand
i
did
not
think
it
possible
at
the
same
time
the
door
flew
open
and
a
troop
of
men
their
faces
covered
with
blood
and
blackened
with
powder
their
swords
drawn
and
their
pikes
and
arquebuses
levelled
rushed
into
the
apartment
coconnas
was
at
their
head
his
red
hair
bristling
his
pale
blue
eyes
extraordinarily
dilated
his
cheek
cut
open
by
la
mole
sword
which
had
ploughed
its
bloody
furrow
there
thus
disfigured
the
piedmontese
was
terrible
to
behold
by
heaven
he
cried
there
he
is
there
he
is
ah
this
time
we
have
him
at
last
la
mole
looked
round
him
for
a
weapon
but
in
vain
he
glanced
at
the
queen
and
saw
the
deepest
pity
depicted
in
her
face
then
he
felt
that
she
alone
could
save
him
he
threw
his
arms
round
her
coconnas
advanced
and
with
the
point
of
his
long
rapier
again
wounded
his
enemy
shoulder
and
the
crimson
drops
of
warm
blood
stained
the
white
and
perfumed
sheets
of
marguerite
couch
marguerite
saw
the
blood
flow
she
felt
the
shudder
that
ran
through
la
mole
frame
she
threw
herself
with
him
into
the
recess
between
the
bed
and
the
wall
it
was
time
for
la
mole
whose
strength
was
exhausted
was
incapable
of
flight
or
resistance
he
leaned
his
pallid
head
on
marguerite
shoulder
and
his
hand
convulsively
seized
and
tore
the
thin
embroidered
cambric
which
enveloped
marguerite
body
in
a
billow
of
gauze
oh
madame
murmured
he
in
a
dying
voice
save
me
he
could
say
no
more
a
mist
like
the
darkness
of
death
came
over
his
eyes
his
head
sunk
back
his
arms
fell
at
his
side
his
legs
gave
way
and
he
sank
on
the
floor
bathed
in
his
blood
and
dragging
the
queen
with
him
at
this
moment
coconnas
excited
by
the
shouts
intoxicated
by
the
sight
of
blood
and
exasperated
by
the
long
chase
advanced
toward
the
recess
in
another
instant
his
sword
would
have
pierced
la
mole
heart
and
perhaps
marguerite
also
at
the
sight
of
the
bare
steel
and
even
more
moved
at
such
brutal
insolence
the
daughter
of
kings
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
stature
and
uttered
such
a
shriek
of
terror
indignation
and
rage
that
the
piedmontese
stood
petrified
by
an
unknown
feeling
and
yet
undoubtedly
had
this
scene
been
prolonged
and
no
other
actor
taken
part
in
it
his
feeling
would
have
vanished
like
a
morning
snow
under
an
april
sun
but
suddenly
a
secret
door
in
the
wall
opened
and
a
pale
young
man
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
dressed
in
black
and
with
his
hair
in
disorder
rushed
in
wait
sister
he
cried
here
i
am
here
i
am
françois
françois
cried
marguerite
help
help
the
duc
murmured
la
hurière
grounding
his
arquebuse
by
heaven
a
son
of
france
growled
coconnas
drawing
back
the
duke
glanced
round
him
he
saw
marguerite
dishevelled
more
lovely
than
ever
leaning
against
the
wall
surrounded
by
men
fury
in
their
eyes
sweat
on
their
foreheads
and
foam
in
their
mouths
wretches
cried
he
save
me
brother
shrieked
marguerite
they
are
going
to
kill
me
a
flame
flashed
across
the
duke
pallid
face
he
was
unarmed
but
sustained
no
doubt
by
the
consciousness
of
his
rank
he
advanced
with
clinched
fists
toward
coconnas
and
his
companions
who
retreated
terrified
at
the
lightning
darting
from
his
eyes
ha
and
will
you
murder
a
son
of
france
too
cried
the
duke
then
as
they
recoiled
ho
there
captain
of
the
guard
hang
every
one
of
these
ruffians
more
alarmed
at
the
sight
of
this
weaponless
young
man
than
he
would
have
been
at
the
aspect
of
a
regiment
of
reiters
or
lansquenets
coconnas
had
already
reached
the
door
la
hurière
was
leaping
downstairs
like
a
deer
and
the
soldiers
were
jostling
and
pushing
one
another
in
the
vestibule
in
their
endeavors
to
escape
finding
the
door
far
too
small
for
their
great
desire
to
be
outside
it
meantime
marguerite
had
instinctively
thrown
the
damask
coverlid
of
her
bed
over
la
mole
and
withdrawn
from
him
when
the
last
murderer
had
departed
the
duc
came
back
sister
he
cried
seeing
marguerite
all
dabbled
with
blood
are
you
wounded
and
he
sprang
toward
his
sister
with
a
solicitude
which
would
have
done
credit
to
his
affection
if
he
had
not
been
charged
with
harboring
too
deep
an
affection
for
a
brother
to
entertain
for
a
sister
no
said
she
i
think
not
or
if
so
very
slightly
but
this
blood
said
the
duke
running
his
trembling
hands
all
over
marguerite
body
where
does
it
come
from
i
know
not
replied
she
one
of
those
wretches
laid
his
hand
on
me
and
perhaps
he
was
wounded
what
cried
the
duke
he
dared
to
touch
my
sister
oh
if
you
had
only
pointed
him
out
to
me
if
you
had
told
me
which
one
it
was
if
i
knew
where
to
find
him
hush
said
marguerite
and
why
asked
françois
because
if
you
were
seen
at
this
time
of
night
in
my
room
ca
a
brother
visit
his
sister
marguerite
the
queen
gave
the
duke
a
look
so
keen
and
yet
so
threatening
that
the
young
man
drew
back
yes
yes
marguerite
said
he
you
are
right
i
will
go
to
my
room
but
you
can
not
remain
alone
this
dreadful
night
shall
i
call
gillonne
no
no
leave
me
françois
leave
me
go
by
the
way
you
came
the
young
prince
obeyed
and
hardly
had
he
disappeared
when
marguerite
hearing
a
sigh
from
behind
her
bed
hurriedly
bolted
the
door
of
the
secret
passage
and
then
hastening
to
the
other
entrance
closed
it
in
the
same
way
just
as
a
troop
of
archers
and
soldiers
like
a
hurricane
dashed
by
in
hot
chase
of
some
other
huguenot
residents
in
the
louvre
after
glancing
round
to
assure
herself
that
she
was
really
alone
she
again
went
to
the
ruelle
of
her
bed
lifted
the
damask
covering
which
had
concealed
la
mole
from
the
duc
and
drawing
the
apparently
lifeless
body
by
great
exertion
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
finding
that
the
victim
still
breathed
sat
down
placed
his
head
on
her
knees
and
sprinkled
his
face
with
water
then
as
the
water
cleared
away
the
mask
of
blood
dust
and
gunpowder
which
had
covered
his
face
marguerite
recognized
the
handsome
cavalier
who
full
of
life
and
hope
had
three
or
four
hours
before
come
to
ask
her
to
look
out
for
his
interests
with
her
protection
and
that
of
the
king
of
navarre
and
had
gone
away
dazzled
by
her
beauty
leaving
her
also
impressed
by
his
marguerite
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
for
now
what
she
felt
for
the
wounded
man
was
more
than
mere
pity
it
was
interest
he
was
no
longer
a
mere
stranger
he
was
almost
an
acquaintance
by
her
care
la
mole
fine
features
soon
reappeared
free
from
stain
but
pale
and
distorted
by
pain
a
shudder
ran
through
her
whole
frame
as
she
tremblingly
placed
her
hand
on
his
heart
it
was
still
beating
then
she
took
a
from
the
table
and
applied
it
to
his
nostrils
la
mole
opened
his
eyes
oh
dieu
murmured
he
where
am
i
saved
said
marguerite
reassure
yourself
you
are
saved
la
mole
turned
his
eyes
on
the
queen
gazed
earnestly
for
a
moment
and
murmured
oh
how
beautiful
you
are
then
as
if
the
vision
were
too
much
for
him
he
closed
his
lids
and
drew
a
sigh
marguerite
started
he
had
become
still
paler
than
before
if
that
were
possible
and
for
an
instant
that
sigh
was
his
last
oh
my
god
my
god
she
ejaculated
have
pity
on
him
at
this
moment
a
violent
knocking
was
heard
at
the
door
marguerite
half
raised
herself
still
supporting
la
mole
who
is
there
she
cried
madame
it
is
i
it
is
i
replied
a
woman
voice
the
duchesse
de
nevers
henriette
cried
marguerite
there
is
no
danger
it
is
a
friend
of
mine
do
you
hear
sir
la
mole
with
some
effort
got
up
on
one
knee
try
to
support
yourself
while
i
go
and
open
the
door
said
the
queen
la
mole
rested
his
hand
on
the
floor
and
succeeded
in
holding
himself
upright
marguerite
took
one
step
toward
the
door
but
suddenly
stopped
shivering
with
terror
ah
you
are
not
alone
she
said
hearing
the
clash
of
arms
outside
no
i
have
twelve
guards
which
my
monsieur
de
guise
assigned
me
monsieur
de
guise
murmured
la
mole
the
assassin
the
assassin
silence
said
marguerite
not
a
word
and
she
looked
round
to
see
where
she
could
conceal
the
wounded
man
a
sword
a
dagger
muttered
la
mole
to
defend
yourself
useless
did
you
not
hear
there
are
twelve
of
them
and
you
are
alone
not
to
defend
myself
but
that
i
may
not
fall
alive
into
their
hands
no
no
said
marguerite
no
i
will
save
you
ah
this
cabinet
come
come
la
mole
made
an
effort
and
supported
by
marguerite
dragged
himself
to
the
cabinet
marguerite
locked
the
door
upon
him
and
hid
the
key
in
her
not
a
cry
not
a
groan
not
a
sigh
whispered
she
through
the
panelling
and
you
are
saved
then
hastily
throwing
a
over
her
shoulders
she
opened
the
door
for
her
friend
who
tenderly
embraced
her
ah
cried
madame
nevers
then
nothing
has
happened
to
you
madame
no
nothing
at
all
replied
marguerite
wrapping
the
mantle
still
more
closely
round
her
to
conceal
the
spots
of
blood
on
her
peignoir
is
well
however
as
monsieur
de
guise
has
given
me
twelve
of
his
guards
to
escort
me
to
his
hôtel
and
as
i
do
not
need
such
a
large
company
i
am
going
to
leave
six
with
your
majesty
six
of
the
guards
are
worth
a
regiment
of
the
king
marguerite
dared
not
refuse
she
placed
the
soldiers
in
the
corridor
and
embraced
the
duchess
who
then
returned
to
the
hôtel
de
guise
where
she
resided
in
her
husband
absence
chapter
ix
the
murderers
coconnas
had
not
fled
he
had
retreated
la
hurière
had
not
fled
he
had
flown
the
one
had
disappeared
like
a
tiger
the
other
like
a
wolf
the
consequence
was
that
la
hurière
had
already
reached
the
place
saint
germain
when
coconnas
was
only
just
leaving
the
louvre
la
hurière
finding
himself
alone
with
his
arquebuse
while
around
him
men
were
running
bullets
were
whistling
and
bodies
were
falling
from
windows
some
whole
others
dismembered
began
to
be
afraid
and
was
prudently
thinking
of
returning
to
his
tavern
but
as
he
turned
into
the
rue
de
sec
from
the
rue
he
fell
in
with
a
troop
of
swiss
and
light
cavalry
it
was
the
one
commanded
by
maurevel
well
cried
maurevel
who
had
christened
himself
with
the
nickname
of
king
killer
have
you
finished
so
soon
are
you
going
back
to
your
tavern
worthy
landlord
and
what
the
devil
have
you
done
with
our
piedmontese
gentleman
no
misfortune
has
happened
to
him
that
would
be
a
shame
for
he
started
out
well
no
i
think
not
replied
la
hurière
i
hope
he
will
rejoin
us
where
have
you
been
at
the
louvre
and
i
must
say
we
were
very
rudely
treated
there
by
whom
monsieur
le
duc
is
he
interested
in
this
affair
monseigneur
le
duc
is
not
interested
in
anything
which
does
not
concern
himself
personally
propose
to
treat
his
two
older
brothers
as
huguenots
and
he
would
be
in
it
provided
only
that
the
work
should
be
done
without
compromising
him
but
wo
you
go
with
these
worthy
fellows
maître
la
hurière
and
where
are
they
going
oh
rue
montorguen
there
is
a
huguenot
minister
there
whom
i
know
he
has
a
wife
and
six
children
these
heretics
are
enormous
breeders
it
will
be
interesting
and
where
are
you
going
oh
i
have
a
little
private
business
say
there
do
go
off
without
me
said
a
voice
which
made
maurevel
start
you
know
all
the
good
places
and
i
want
to
have
my
share
ah
it
is
our
piedmontese
said
maurevel
yes
it
is
monsieur
de
coconnas
said
la
hurière
i
thought
you
were
following
me
hang
it
you
made
off
too
swiftly
for
that
and
besides
i
turned
a
little
to
one
side
so
as
to
fling
into
the
river
a
frightful
child
who
was
screaming
with
the
papists
long
live
the
admiral
unfortunately
i
believe
the
little
rascal
knew
how
to
swim
these
miserable
heretics
must
be
flung
into
the
water
like
cats
before
their
eyes
are
opened
if
they
are
to
be
drowned
at
all
ah
you
say
you
are
just
from
the
louvre
so
your
huguenot
took
refuge
there
did
he
asked
maurevel
dieu
yes
i
gave
him
a
at
the
moment
when
he
was
picking
up
his
sword
in
the
admiral
but
i
somehow
or
other
missed
him
well
i
did
not
miss
him
added
coconnas
i
gave
him
such
a
thrust
in
the
back
that
my
sword
was
wet
five
inches
up
the
blade
besides
i
saw
him
fall
into
the
arms
of
madame
marguerite
a
pretty
woman
by
heaven
yet
i
confess
i
should
not
be
sorry
to
hear
he
was
really
dead
the
vagabond
is
infernally
spiteful
and
capable
of
bearing
me
a
grudge
all
his
life
but
did
you
say
you
were
bound
somewhere
why
do
you
mean
to
go
with
me
i
do
not
like
standing
still
by
heaven
i
have
killed
only
three
or
four
as
yet
and
when
i
get
cold
my
shoulder
pains
me
forward
forward
captain
said
maurevel
to
the
commander
of
the
troop
give
me
three
men
and
go
and
despatch
your
parson
with
the
rest
three
swiss
stepped
forward
and
joined
maurevel
nevertheless
the
two
companies
proceeded
side
by
side
till
they
reached
the
top
of
the
rue
tirechappe
there
the
light
horse
and
the
swiss
took
the
rue
de
la
tonnellerie
while
maurevel
coconnas
la
hurière
and
his
three
men
were
proceeding
down
the
rue
trousse
vache
and
entering
the
rue
sainte
avoye
where
the
devil
are
you
taking
us
asked
coconnas
who
was
beginning
to
be
bored
by
this
long
march
from
which
he
could
see
no
results
i
am
taking
you
on
an
expedition
at
once
brilliant
and
useful
next
to
the
admiral
next
to
téligny
next
to
the
huguenot
princes
i
could
offer
you
nothing
better
so
have
patience
our
business
calls
us
to
the
rue
du
chaume
and
we
shall
be
there
in
a
second
tell
me
said
coconnas
is
not
the
rue
du
chaume
near
the
temple
yes
why
because
an
old
creditor
of
our
family
lives
there
one
lambert
mercandon
to
whom
my
father
wished
me
to
hand
over
a
hundred
rose
nobles
i
have
in
my
pocket
for
that
purpose
well
replied
maurevel
this
is
a
good
opportunity
for
paying
it
this
is
the
day
for
settling
old
accounts
is
your
mercandon
a
huguenot
oho
i
understand
said
coconnas
he
must
be
hush
here
we
are
what
is
that
large
hôtel
with
its
entrance
in
the
street
the
hôtel
de
guise
truly
returned
coconnas
i
should
not
have
failed
to
come
here
as
i
am
under
the
patronage
of
the
great
henry
but
by
heaven
all
is
so
very
quiet
in
this
quarter
we
scarcely
hear
any
firing
and
we
might
fancy
ourselves
in
the
country
the
devil
fetch
me
but
every
one
is
asleep
and
indeed
the
hôtel
de
guise
seemed
as
quiet
as
in
ordinary
times
all
the
windows
were
closed
and
a
solitary
light
was
burning
behind
the
blind
of
the
principal
window
over
the
entrance
which
had
attracted
coconnas
attention
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
street
just
beyond
the
hôtel
de
guise
in
other
words
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
du
petit
chantier
and
the
rue
des
quatre
fils
maurevel
halted
here
is
the
house
of
the
man
we
want
said
he
of
the
man
you
want
that
is
to
say
observed
la
hurière
since
you
are
with
me
we
want
him
what
that
house
which
seems
so
sound
asleep
exactly
la
hurière
now
go
and
make
practical
use
of
the
plausible
face
which
heaven
by
some
blunder
gave
you
and
knock
at
that
house
hand
your
arquebuse
to
de
coconnas
who
has
been
ogling
it
this
last
half
hour
if
you
are
admitted
you
must
ask
to
speak
to
seigneur
de
mouy
aha
exclaimed
coconnas
now
i
understand
you
also
have
a
creditor
in
the
quarter
of
the
temple
it
would
seem
exactly
so
responded
maurevel
you
will
go
up
to
him
pretending
to
be
a
huguenot
and
inform
de
mouy
of
all
that
has
taken
place
he
is
brave
and
will
come
down
and
once
down
asked
la
hurière
once
down
i
will
beg
of
him
to
cross
swords
with
me
on
my
soul
is
a
fine
gentleman
said
coconnas
and
i
propose
to
do
exactly
the
same
thing
with
lambert
mercandon
and
if
he
is
too
old
to
respond
i
will
try
it
with
one
of
his
sons
or
nephews
la
hurière
without
making
any
reply
went
and
knocked
at
the
door
and
the
sounds
echoing
in
the
silence
of
the
night
caused
the
doors
of
the
hôtel
de
guise
to
open
and
several
heads
to
make
their
appearance
from
out
them
it
was
evident
that
the
hôtel
was
quiet
after
the
manner
of
citadels
that
is
to
say
because
it
was
filled
with
soldiers
the
heads
were
almost
instantly
withdrawn
as
doubtless
an
inkling
of
the
matter
in
hand
was
divined
does
your
monsieur
de
mouy
live
here
inquired
coconnas
pointing
to
the
house
at
which
la
hurière
was
still
knocking
no
but
his
mistress
does
by
heaven
how
gallant
you
are
to
give
him
an
occasion
to
draw
sword
in
the
presence
of
his
we
shall
be
the
judges
of
the
field
however
i
should
like
very
well
to
fight
myself
my
shoulder
burns
and
your
face
added
maurevel
is
considerably
damaged
coconnas
uttered
a
kind
of
growl
by
heaven
he
said
i
hope
he
is
dead
if
i
thought
not
i
would
return
to
the
louvre
and
finish
him
la
hurière
still
kept
knocking
soon
the
window
on
the
first
floor
opened
and
a
man
appeared
in
the
balcony
in
a
nightcap
and
drawers
and
unarmed
who
there
cried
he
maurevel
made
a
sign
to
the
swiss
who
retreated
into
a
corner
whilst
coconnas
stood
close
against
the
wall
ah
monsieur
de
mouy
said
the
innkeeper
in
his
blandest
tones
is
that
you
yes
what
then
it
is
he
said
maurevel
with
a
thrill
of
joy
why
sir
continued
la
hurière
do
you
not
know
what
is
going
on
they
are
murdering
the
admiral
and
massacring
all
of
our
religion
hasten
to
their
assistance
come
ah
exclaimed
de
mouy
i
feared
something
was
plotted
for
this
night
i
ought
not
to
have
deserted
my
worthy
comrades
i
will
come
my
friend
wait
for
me
and
without
closing
the
window
through
which
a
frightened
woman
could
be
heard
uttering
lamentations
and
tender
entreaties
monsieur
de
mouy
got
his
doublet
his
mantle
and
his
weapons
he
is
coming
down
he
is
coming
down
muttered
maurevel
pale
with
joy
attention
the
rest
of
you
he
whispered
to
the
swiss
then
taking
the
arquebuse
from
coconnas
he
blew
on
the
tinder
to
make
sure
that
it
was
still
alight
here
la
hurière
he
added
addressing
the
innkeeper
who
had
rejoined
the
main
body
of
the
company
here
take
your
arquebuse
by
heaven
exclaimed
coconnas
the
moon
is
coming
out
of
the
clouds
to
witness
this
beautiful
fight
i
would
give
a
great
deal
if
lambert
mercandon
were
here
to
serve
as
monsieur
de
mouy
second
wait
wait
said
maurevel
monsieur
de
mouy
alone
is
equal
to
a
dozen
men
and
it
is
likely
that
we
six
shall
have
enough
to
do
to
despatch
him
forward
my
men
continued
maurevel
making
a
sign
to
the
swiss
to
stand
by
the
door
in
order
to
strike
de
mouy
as
he
came
forth
oho
said
coconnas
as
he
watched
these
arrangements
it
appears
that
this
will
not
come
off
quite
as
i
expected
already
the
noise
made
by
de
mouy
in
withdrawing
the
bar
was
heard
the
swiss
had
left
their
to
arrange
themselves
near
the
door
maurevel
and
la
hurière
were
going
forward
on
tiptoe
and
coconnas
with
a
dying
gleam
of
gentlemanly
feeling
was
standing
where
he
was
when
the
young
woman
who
had
been
for
the
moment
utterly
forgotten
suddenly
appeared
on
the
balcony
and
uttered
a
terrible
shriek
at
the
sight
of
the
swiss
maurevel
and
la
hurière
de
mouy
who
had
already
half
opened
the
door
paused
come
back
come
back
cried
the
young
woman
i
see
swords
glitter
and
the
match
of
an
arquebuse
there
is
treachery
oho
said
the
young
man
let
us
see
then
what
all
this
means
and
he
closed
the
door
replaced
the
bar
and
went
upstairs
again
maurevel
order
of
battle
was
changed
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
de
mouy
was
not
going
to
come
out
the
swiss
went
and
posted
themselves
at
the
other
corner
of
the
street
and
la
hurière
with
his
arquebuse
in
his
hand
waited
till
the
enemy
reappeared
at
the
window
he
did
not
wait
long
de
mouy
came
forward
holding
before
him
two
pistols
of
such
respectable
length
that
la
hurière
who
was
already
aiming
suddenly
reflected
that
the
huguenot
bullets
had
no
farther
to
fly
in
reaching
the
street
from
the
balcony
than
his
had
in
reaching
the
balcony
assuredly
said
he
to
himself
i
may
kill
this
gentleman
but
likewise
this
gentleman
may
kill
me
in
the
same
way
now
as
maître
la
hurière
an
innkeeper
by
profession
was
only
accidentally
a
soldier
this
reflection
determined
him
to
retreat
and
seek
shelter
in
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
braque
far
enough
away
to
cause
him
some
difficulty
in
finding
with
a
certain
certainty
especially
at
night
the
line
which
a
bullet
from
his
arquebuse
would
take
in
reaching
de
mouy
de
mouy
cast
a
glance
around
him
and
advanced
cautiously
like
a
man
preparing
to
fight
a
duel
but
seeing
nothing
he
exclaimed
why
it
appears
my
worthy
informant
that
you
have
forgotten
your
arquebuse
at
my
door
here
i
am
what
do
you
want
with
me
aha
said
coconnas
to
himself
he
is
certainly
a
brave
fellow
well
continued
de
mouy
friends
or
enemies
whichever
you
are
do
you
not
see
i
am
waiting
la
hurière
kept
silence
maurevel
made
no
reply
and
the
three
swiss
remained
in
covert
coconnas
waited
an
instant
then
seeing
that
no
one
took
part
in
the
conversation
begun
by
la
hurière
and
continued
by
de
mouy
he
left
his
station
and
advancing
into
the
middle
of
the
street
took
off
his
hat
and
said
sir
we
are
not
here
for
an
assassination
as
you
seem
to
suppose
but
for
a
duel
i
am
here
with
one
of
your
enemies
who
was
desirous
of
meeting
you
to
end
gallantly
an
old
controversy
eh
by
heaven
come
forward
monsieur
de
maurevel
instead
of
turning
your
back
the
gentleman
accepts
maurevel
cried
de
mouy
maurevel
the
assassin
of
my
father
maurevel
the
king
assassin
ah
by
heaven
yes
i
accept
and
taking
aim
at
maurevel
who
was
about
to
knock
at
the
hôtel
de
guise
to
request
a
reinforcement
he
sent
a
bullet
through
his
hat
at
the
noise
of
the
report
and
maurevel
shouts
the
guard
which
had
escorted
the
duchesse
de
nevers
came
out
accompanied
by
three
or
four
gentlemen
followed
by
their
pages
and
approached
the
house
of
young
de
mouy
mistress
a
second
fired
into
the
midst
of
the
troop
killed
the
soldier
next
to
maurevel
after
which
de
mouy
finding
himself
weaponless
or
at
least
with
useless
weapons
for
his
pistols
had
been
fired
and
his
adversaries
were
beyond
the
reach
of
his
sword
took
shelter
behind
the
balcony
gallery
meantime
here
and
there
windows
began
to
be
thrown
open
in
the
neighborhood
and
according
to
the
pacific
or
bellicose
dispositions
of
their
inhabitants
were
barricaded
or
bristled
with
muskets
and
arquebuses
help
my
worthy
mercandon
shouted
de
mouy
beckoning
to
an
elderly
man
who
from
a
window
which
had
just
been
thrown
open
in
front
of
the
hôtel
de
guise
was
trying
to
make
out
the
cause
of
the
confusion
is
it
you
who
call
sire
de
mouy
cried
the
old
man
are
they
attacking
you
me
you
all
the
protestants
and
wait
there
is
the
proof
that
moment
de
mouy
had
seen
la
hurière
aim
his
arquebuse
at
him
it
was
fired
but
the
young
man
had
time
to
stoop
and
the
ball
broke
a
window
above
his
head
mercandon
exclaimed
coconnas
who
in
his
delight
at
sight
of
this
fray
had
forgotten
his
creditor
but
was
reminded
of
him
by
de
apostrophe
mercandon
rue
du
chaume
that
is
it
ah
he
lives
there
good
each
of
us
will
settle
accounts
with
our
man
and
while
the
people
from
the
hôtel
de
guise
were
breaking
in
the
doors
of
de
mouy
house
and
maurevel
with
a
torch
in
his
hand
was
trying
to
set
it
on
fire
while
now
that
the
doors
were
once
broken
there
was
a
fearful
struggle
with
a
single
antagonist
who
at
each
brought
down
his
foe
coconnas
tried
by
the
help
of
a
to
break
in
mercandon
door
and
the
latter
unmoved
by
this
solitary
effort
was
doing
his
best
with
his
arquebuse
out
of
his
window
and
now
all
this
dark
and
deserted
quarter
was
lighted
up
as
if
by
open
day
peopled
like
the
interior
of
an
for
from
the
hôtel
de
montmorency
six
or
eight
huguenot
gentlemen
with
their
servants
and
friends
had
just
made
a
furious
charge
and
supported
by
the
firing
from
the
windows
were
beginning
to
repulse
maurevel
and
the
de
guises
force
who
at
length
were
driven
back
to
the
place
whence
they
had
come
coconnas
who
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
smashing
mercandon
door
though
he
was
working
at
it
with
all
his
might
was
caught
in
this
sudden
retreat
placing
his
back
to
the
wall
and
grasping
his
sword
firmly
he
began
not
only
to
defend
himself
but
to
attack
his
assailants
with
cries
so
terrible
that
they
were
heard
above
all
the
uproar
he
struck
right
and
left
hitting
friends
and
enemies
until
a
wide
space
was
cleared
around
him
as
his
rapier
made
a
hole
in
some
breast
and
the
warm
blood
spurted
over
his
hands
and
face
he
with
dilated
eye
expanded
nostrils
and
clinched
teeth
regained
the
ground
lost
and
again
approached
the
beleaguered
house
de
mouy
after
a
terrible
combat
in
the
staircase
and
hall
had
finally
come
out
of
the
burning
house
like
a
true
hero
in
the
midst
of
all
the
struggle
he
had
not
ceased
to
cry
here
maurevel
maurevel
where
are
you
insulting
him
by
the
most
opprobrious
epithets
he
at
length
appeared
in
the
street
supporting
on
one
arm
his
mistress
half
naked
and
nearly
fainting
and
holding
a
poniard
between
his
teeth
his
sword
flaming
by
the
sweeping
action
he
gave
it
traced
circles
of
white
or
red
according
as
the
moon
glittered
on
the
blade
or
a
flambeau
glared
on
its
brightness
maurevel
had
fled
la
hurière
driven
back
by
de
mouy
as
far
as
coconnas
who
did
not
recognize
him
and
received
him
at
sword
point
was
begging
for
mercy
on
both
sides
at
this
moment
mercandon
perceived
him
and
knew
him
by
his
white
scarf
to
be
one
of
the
murderers
he
fired
la
hurière
shrieked
threw
up
his
arms
dropped
his
arquebuse
and
after
having
vainly
attempted
to
reach
the
wall
in
order
to
support
himself
fell
with
his
face
flat
on
the
earth
de
mouy
took
advantage
of
this
circumstance
turned
down
the
rue
de
paradis
and
disappeared
such
had
been
the
resistance
of
the
huguenots
that
the
de
guise
party
quite
repulsed
had
retired
into
their
hôtel
fearing
to
be
besieged
and
taken
in
their
own
habitation
coconnas
who
intoxicated
with
blood
and
tumult
had
reached
that
degree
of
excitement
when
with
the
men
of
the
south
more
especially
courage
changes
into
madness
had
not
seen
or
heard
anything
and
noticed
only
that
there
was
not
such
a
roar
in
his
ears
and
that
his
hands
and
face
were
a
little
dryer
than
they
had
been
dropping
the
point
of
his
sword
he
saw
near
him
a
man
lying
face
downward
in
a
red
stream
and
around
him
burning
houses
it
was
a
very
short
truce
for
just
as
he
was
approaching
this
man
whom
he
recognized
as
la
hurière
the
door
of
the
house
he
had
in
vain
tried
to
burst
in
opened
and
old
mercandon
followed
by
his
son
and
two
nephews
rushed
upon
him
here
he
is
here
he
is
cried
they
all
with
one
voice
coconnas
was
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
fearing
to
be
surrounded
by
these
four
men
who
assailed
him
at
once
sprang
backward
with
the
agility
of
one
of
the
chamois
which
he
had
so
often
hunted
in
his
native
mountains
and
in
an
instant
found
himself
with
his
back
against
the
wall
of
the
hôtel
de
guise
once
at
ease
as
to
not
being
surprised
from
behind
he
put
himself
in
a
posture
of
defence
and
said
jestingly
aha
father
mercandon
do
you
know
me
wretch
cried
the
old
huguenot
i
know
you
well
you
are
engaged
against
me
me
your
father
friend
and
companion
and
his
creditor
are
you
not
yes
his
creditor
as
you
say
well
then
said
coconnas
i
have
come
to
settle
our
accounts
seize
him
bind
him
said
mercandon
to
the
young
men
who
accompanied
him
and
who
at
his
bidding
rushed
toward
the
piedmontese
one
moment
one
moment
said
coconnas
laughing
to
seize
a
man
you
must
have
a
writ
and
you
have
forgotten
to
secure
one
from
the
provost
and
with
these
words
he
crossed
his
sword
with
the
young
man
nearest
to
him
and
at
the
first
blow
cut
his
wrist
the
wounded
man
retreated
with
a
howl
that
will
do
for
one
said
coconnas
at
the
same
moment
the
window
under
which
coconnas
had
sought
shelter
opened
noisily
he
sprang
to
one
side
fearing
an
attack
from
behind
but
instead
of
an
enemy
he
saw
a
woman
instead
of
the
enemy
weapon
he
was
prepared
to
encounter
a
nosegay
fell
at
his
feet
ah
he
said
a
woman
he
saluted
the
lady
with
his
sword
and
stooped
to
pick
up
the
bouquet
be
on
your
guard
brave
catholic
be
on
your
guard
cried
the
lady
coconnas
rose
but
not
before
the
second
nephew
dagger
had
pierced
his
cloak
and
wounded
his
other
shoulder
the
lady
uttered
a
piercing
shriek
coconnas
thanked
her
assured
her
by
a
gesture
and
then
made
a
pass
which
the
nephew
parried
but
at
the
second
thrust
his
foot
slipped
in
the
blood
and
coconnas
springing
at
him
like
a
drove
his
sword
through
his
breast
good
good
brave
cavalier
exclaimed
the
lady
of
the
hôtel
de
guise
good
i
will
send
you
succor
do
not
give
yourself
any
trouble
about
that
madame
was
reply
rather
look
on
to
the
end
if
it
interests
you
and
see
how
the
comte
annibal
de
coconnas
settles
the
huguenots
at
this
moment
old
mercandon
son
aimed
a
pistol
at
close
range
to
coconnas
and
fired
the
count
fell
on
his
knee
the
lady
at
the
window
shrieked
again
but
coconnas
rose
instantly
he
had
knelt
only
to
avoid
the
bullet
which
struck
the
wall
about
two
feet
beneath
where
the
lady
was
standing
almost
at
the
same
moment
a
cry
of
rage
issued
from
the
window
of
mercandon
house
and
an
old
woman
who
recognized
coconnas
as
a
catholic
from
his
white
scarf
and
cross
hurled
a
at
him
which
struck
him
above
the
knee
capital
said
coconnas
one
throws
flowers
at
me
and
at
the
other
if
this
goes
on
they
be
tearing
houses
down
thanks
mother
thanks
said
the
young
man
go
on
wife
go
on
said
old
mercandon
but
take
care
of
yourself
wait
monsieur
de
coconnas
wait
said
the
young
woman
of
the
hôtel
de
guise
i
will
have
them
shoot
at
the
windows
ah
so
it
is
a
hell
of
women
is
it
said
coconnas
some
of
them
for
me
and
the
others
against
me
by
heaven
let
us
put
an
end
to
this
the
scene
in
fact
was
much
changed
and
was
evidently
approaching
its
climax
coconnas
who
was
wounded
to
be
sure
but
who
had
all
the
vigor
of
his
four
and
twenty
years
was
used
to
arms
and
angered
rather
than
weakened
by
the
three
or
four
scratches
he
had
received
now
faced
only
mercandon
and
his
son
mercandon
an
aged
man
between
sixty
and
seventy
his
son
a
youth
of
sixteen
or
eighteen
pale
and
slender
had
flung
down
his
pistol
which
had
been
discharged
and
was
therefore
useless
and
was
feebly
brandishing
a
sword
half
as
long
as
the
piedmontese
the
father
armed
only
with
an
unloaded
arquebuse
and
a
poniard
was
calling
for
assistance
an
old
woman
the
young
mother
in
the
opposite
window
held
in
her
hand
a
piece
of
marble
which
she
was
preparing
to
hurl
coconnas
excited
on
the
one
hand
by
threats
and
on
the
other
by
encouragements
proud
of
his
victory
intoxicated
with
powder
and
blood
lighted
by
the
reflection
of
a
burning
house
elated
by
the
idea
that
he
was
fighting
under
the
eyes
of
a
woman
whose
beauty
was
as
superior
as
he
was
sure
her
rank
was
high
coconnas
like
the
last
of
the
horatii
felt
his
strength
redouble
and
seeing
the
young
man
falter
rushed
on
him
and
crossed
his
small
weapon
with
his
terrible
and
bloody
rapier
two
strokes
sufficed
to
drive
it
out
of
its
hands
then
mercandon
tried
to
drive
coconnas
back
so
that
the
projectiles
thrown
from
the
window
might
be
sure
to
strike
him
but
coconnas
to
paralyze
the
double
attack
of
the
old
man
who
tried
to
stab
him
with
his
dagger
and
the
mother
of
the
young
man
who
was
endeavoring
to
break
his
skull
with
a
stone
she
was
ready
to
throw
seized
his
adversary
by
the
body
presenting
him
to
all
the
blows
like
a
shield
and
strangling
him
in
his
herculean
grasp
help
help
cried
the
young
man
he
is
crushing
my
chest
help
help
and
his
voice
grew
faint
in
a
low
and
choking
groan
then
mercandon
ceased
to
attack
and
began
to
entreat
mercy
mercy
monsieur
de
coconnas
have
mercy
he
is
my
only
child
he
is
my
son
my
son
cried
the
mother
the
hope
of
our
old
age
do
not
kill
him
sir
do
not
kill
him
really
cried
coconnas
bursting
into
laughter
not
kill
him
what
pray
did
he
mean
to
do
to
me
with
his
sword
and
pistol
sir
said
mercandon
clasping
his
hands
i
have
at
home
your
note
of
hand
i
will
give
it
back
to
you
i
have
ten
thousand
crowns
of
gold
i
will
give
them
to
you
i
have
our
family
jewels
they
shall
be
yours
but
do
not
kill
him
do
not
kill
him
and
i
have
my
love
said
the
lady
in
the
hôtel
de
guise
in
a
low
tone
and
i
promise
it
you
coconnas
reflected
a
moment
and
said
suddenly
are
you
a
huguenot
yes
i
am
murmured
the
youth
then
you
must
die
replied
coconnas
frowning
and
putting
to
his
adversary
breast
his
keen
and
glittering
dagger
die
cried
the
old
man
my
poor
child
die
and
the
mother
shriek
resounded
so
pitifully
and
loud
that
for
a
moment
it
shook
the
piedmontese
firm
resolution
oh
madame
la
duchesse
cried
the
father
turning
toward
the
lady
at
the
hôtel
de
guise
intercede
for
us
and
every
morning
and
evening
you
shall
be
remembered
in
our
prayers
then
let
him
be
a
convert
said
the
lady
i
am
a
protestant
said
the
boy
then
die
exclaimed
coconnas
lifting
his
dagger
die
since
you
will
not
accept
the
life
which
those
lovely
lips
offer
to
you
mercandon
and
his
wife
saw
the
blade
of
that
deadly
weapon
gleam
like
lightning
above
the
head
of
their
son
my
son
olivier
shrieked
his
mother
abjure
abjure
abjure
my
dear
boy
cried
mercandon
going
on
his
knees
to
coconnas
do
not
leave
us
alone
on
the
earth
abjure
all
together
said
coconnas
for
one
three
souls
and
one
life
i
am
willing
said
the
youth
we
are
willing
cried
mercandon
and
his
wife
on
your
knees
then
said
coconnas
and
let
your
son
repeat
after
me
word
for
word
the
prayer
i
shall
say
the
father
obeyed
first
i
am
ready
said
the
son
also
kneeling
coconnas
then
began
to
repeat
in
latin
the
words
of
the
but
whether
from
chance
or
calculation
young
olivier
knelt
close
to
where
his
sword
had
fallen
scarcely
did
he
see
this
weapon
within
his
reach
than
not
ceasing
to
repeat
the
words
which
coconnas
dictated
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
take
it
up
coconnas
watched
the
movement
although
he
pretended
not
to
see
it
but
at
the
moment
when
the
young
man
touched
the
handle
of
the
sword
with
his
fingers
he
rushed
on
him
knocked
him
over
exclaiming
ah
traitor
and
plunged
his
dagger
into
his
throat
the
youth
uttered
one
cry
raised
himself
convulsively
on
his
knee
and
fell
dead
ah
ruffian
shrieked
mercandon
you
slay
us
to
rob
us
of
the
hundred
rose
nobles
you
owe
us
faith
no
said
coconnas
and
the
proof
and
as
he
said
these
words
he
flung
at
the
old
man
feet
the
purse
which
his
father
had
given
him
before
his
departure
to
pay
his
creditor
and
the
proof
he
went
on
to
say
is
this
money
which
i
give
you
and
here
your
death
cried
the
old
woman
from
the
window
take
care
de
coconnas
take
care
called
out
the
lady
at
the
hôtel
de
guise
but
before
coconnas
could
turn
his
head
to
comply
with
this
advice
or
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
threat
a
heavy
mass
came
hissing
through
the
air
fell
on
the
piedmontese
hat
broke
his
sword
and
prostrated
him
on
the
pavement
he
was
overcome
crushed
so
that
he
did
not
hear
the
double
cry
of
joy
and
distress
which
came
from
the
right
and
left
mercandon
instantly
rushed
dagger
in
hand
on
coconnas
now
bereft
of
his
senses
but
at
this
moment
the
door
of
the
hôtel
de
guise
opened
and
the
old
man
seeing
swords
and
partisans
gleaming
fled
while
the
lady
he
had
called
madame
la
duchesse
her
beauty
terrible
in
the
light
of
the
flames
dazzling
with
diamonds
and
other
gems
leaned
half
out
of
the
window
in
order
to
direct
the
newcomers
pointing
her
arm
toward
coconnas
there
there
in
front
of
me
a
gentleman
in
a
red
doublet
there
that
is
he
yes
that
is
he
chapter
x
death
mass
or
the
bastille
marguerite
as
we
have
said
had
shut
the
door
and
returned
to
her
chamber
but
as
she
entered
panting
she
saw
gillonne
who
was
leaning
against
the
door
of
the
closet
staring
at
the
traces
of
blood
on
the
bed
the
furniture
and
the
carpet
ah
madame
she
cried
when
she
saw
the
queen
oh
madame
tell
me
is
he
dead
silence
said
marguerite
in
that
tone
of
voice
which
gives
some
indication
of
the
importance
of
the
command
gillonne
was
silent
marguerite
then
took
from
her
purse
a
tiny
gilded
key
opened
the
closet
door
and
showed
the
young
man
to
the
servant
la
mole
had
succeeded
in
getting
to
his
feet
and
making
his
way
to
the
window
a
small
poniard
such
as
women
at
that
time
were
in
the
habit
of
carrying
was
at
hand
and
when
he
heard
the
door
opening
he
had
seized
it
fear
nothing
sir
said
marguerite
for
on
my
soul
you
are
in
safety
la
mole
sank
on
his
knees
oh
madame
he
cried
you
are
more
than
a
queen
you
are
a
goddess
do
not
agitate
yourself
sir
said
marguerite
your
blood
is
still
flowing
oh
look
gillonne
how
pale
he
is
let
us
see
where
you
are
wounded
madame
said
la
mole
trying
to
fix
on
certain
parts
of
his
body
the
pain
which
pervaded
his
whole
frame
i
think
i
have
a
in
my
shoulder
another
in
my
chest
the
other
wounds
are
not
worth
bothering
about
we
will
see
said
marguerite
gillonne
bring
me
my
balsam
casket
gillonne
obeyed
and
returned
holding
in
one
hand
a
casket
and
in
the
other
a
ewer
and
some
fine
holland
linen
help
me
to
lift
him
gillonne
said
queen
marguerite
for
in
attempting
to
get
up
the
poor
gentleman
has
lost
all
his
strength
but
madame
said
la
mole
i
am
wholly
confused
indeed
i
can
not
allow
but
sir
you
will
let
us
do
for
you
i
think
said
marguerite
when
we
may
save
you
it
would
be
a
crime
to
let
you
die
oh
cried
la
mole
i
would
rather
die
than
see
you
the
queen
stain
your
hands
with
blood
as
unworthy
as
mine
oh
never
never
and
he
drew
back
respectfully
your
blood
sir
replied
gillonne
with
a
smile
has
already
stained
her
majesty
bed
and
chamber
marguerite
folded
her
mantle
over
her
cambric
peignoir
all
bespattered
with
small
red
spots
this
movement
so
expressive
of
feminine
modesty
caused
la
mole
to
remember
that
he
had
held
in
his
arms
and
pressed
to
his
heart
this
beautiful
beloved
queen
and
at
the
recollection
a
fugitive
glow
of
color
came
into
his
pallid
cheeks
madame
stammered
la
mole
can
you
not
leave
me
to
the
care
of
the
surgeon
of
a
catholic
surgeon
perhaps
said
the
queen
with
an
expression
which
la
mole
understood
and
which
made
him
shudder
do
you
not
know
continued
the
queen
in
a
voice
and
with
a
smile
of
incomparable
sweetness
that
we
daughters
of
france
are
trained
to
know
the
qualities
of
herbs
and
to
make
balsams
for
our
duty
as
women
and
as
queens
has
always
been
to
soften
pain
therefore
we
are
equal
to
the
best
surgeons
in
the
world
so
our
flatterers
say
has
not
my
reputation
in
this
regard
come
to
your
ears
come
gillonne
let
us
to
work
la
mole
again
endeavored
to
resist
he
repeated
that
he
would
rather
die
than
occasion
the
queen
labor
which
though
begun
in
pity
might
end
in
disgust
but
this
exertion
completely
exhausted
his
strength
and
falling
back
he
fainted
a
second
time
marguerite
then
seizing
the
poniard
which
he
had
dropped
quickly
cut
the
lace
of
his
doublet
while
gillonne
with
another
blade
ripped
open
the
sleeves
next
gillonne
with
a
cloth
dipped
in
fresh
water
stanched
the
blood
which
escaped
from
his
shoulder
and
breast
and
marguerite
with
a
silver
needle
with
a
round
point
probed
the
wounds
with
all
the
delicacy
and
skill
that
maître
ambroise
paré
could
have
displayed
in
such
a
case
a
dangerous
but
not
mortal
wound
humeri
vulnus
non
autem
murmured
the
lovely
and
learned
hand
me
the
salve
gillonne
and
get
the
lint
ready
meantime
gillonne
to
whom
the
queen
had
just
given
this
new
order
had
already
dried
and
perfumed
the
young
man
chest
and
arms
which
were
like
an
antique
model
as
well
as
his
shoulders
which
fell
gracefully
back
his
neck
shaded
by
thick
curling
locks
and
which
seemed
rather
to
belong
to
a
statue
of
parian
marble
than
the
mangled
frame
of
a
dying
man
poor
young
man
whispered
gillonne
looking
not
so
much
at
her
work
as
at
the
object
of
it
is
he
not
handsome
said
marguerite
with
royal
frankness
yes
madame
but
it
seems
to
me
that
instead
of
leaving
him
lying
there
on
the
floor
we
should
lift
him
on
this
couch
against
which
he
is
leaning
yes
said
marguerite
you
are
right
and
the
two
women
bending
over
uniting
their
strength
raised
la
mole
and
laid
him
on
a
kind
of
great
sofa
in
front
of
the
window
which
they
opened
in
order
to
give
them
fresh
air
this
movement
aroused
la
mole
who
drew
a
long
sigh
and
opening
his
eyes
began
to
experience
that
indescribable
sensation
of
which
comes
to
a
wounded
man
when
on
his
return
to
consciousness
he
finds
coolness
instead
of
burning
heat
and
the
perfumes
of
balsams
instead
of
the
nauseating
odor
of
blood
he
muttered
some
disconnected
words
to
which
marguerite
replied
with
a
smile
placing
her
finger
on
her
lips
at
this
moment
several
raps
on
the
door
were
heard
some
one
knocks
at
the
secret
passage
said
marguerite
who
can
be
coming
madame
asked
gillonne
in
a
panic
i
will
go
and
see
who
it
is
said
marguerite
remain
here
and
do
not
leave
him
for
a
single
instant
marguerite
went
into
the
chamber
and
closing
the
closet
door
opened
that
of
the
passage
which
led
to
the
king
and
queen
apartments
madame
de
sauve
she
exclaimed
suddenly
drawing
back
with
an
expression
which
resembled
hatred
if
not
terror
so
true
it
is
that
a
woman
never
forgives
another
for
taking
from
her
even
a
man
whom
she
does
not
love
madame
de
sauve
yes
your
majesty
she
replied
clasping
her
hands
you
here
madame
exclaimed
marguerite
more
and
more
surprised
while
at
the
same
time
her
voice
grew
more
and
more
imperative
charlotte
fell
on
her
knees
madame
she
said
pardon
me
i
know
how
guilty
i
am
toward
you
but
if
you
knew
the
fault
is
not
wholly
mine
an
express
command
of
the
queen
mother
rise
said
marguerite
and
as
i
do
not
suppose
you
have
come
with
the
intention
of
justifying
yourself
to
me
tell
me
why
you
have
come
at
all
i
have
come
madame
said
charlotte
still
on
her
knees
and
with
a
look
of
wild
alarm
i
came
to
ask
you
if
he
were
not
here
here
who
of
whom
are
you
speaking
madame
for
i
really
do
not
understand
of
the
king
of
the
king
what
do
you
follow
him
to
my
apartments
you
know
very
well
that
he
never
comes
here
ah
madame
continued
the
baronne
de
sauve
without
replying
to
these
attacks
or
even
seeming
to
comprehend
them
ah
would
to
heaven
he
were
here
and
why
so
eh
madame
because
they
are
murdering
the
huguenots
and
the
king
of
navarre
is
the
chief
of
the
huguenots
oh
cried
marguerite
seizing
madame
de
sauve
by
the
hand
and
compelling
her
to
rise
ah
i
had
forgotten
besides
i
did
not
think
a
king
could
run
the
same
dangers
as
other
men
more
madame
a
thousand
times
more
cried
charlotte
in
fact
madame
de
lorraine
had
warned
me
i
had
begged
him
not
to
leave
the
louvre
has
he
done
so
no
no
madame
he
is
in
the
louvre
but
if
he
is
not
here
he
is
not
here
oh
cried
madame
de
sauve
with
an
outburst
of
agony
then
he
is
a
dead
man
for
the
queen
mother
has
sworn
his
destruction
his
destruction
ah
said
marguerite
you
terrify
me
impossible
madame
replied
madame
de
sauve
with
that
energy
which
passion
alone
can
give
i
tell
you
that
no
one
knows
where
the
king
of
navarre
is
and
where
is
the
queen
mother
the
queen
mother
sent
me
to
find
monsieur
de
guise
and
monsieur
de
tavannes
who
were
in
her
oratory
and
then
dismissed
me
then
pardon
me
madame
i
went
to
my
room
and
waited
as
usual
for
my
husband
i
suppose
he
did
not
come
madame
then
i
sought
for
him
everywhere
and
asked
every
one
for
him
one
soldier
told
me
he
thought
he
had
seen
him
in
the
midst
of
the
guards
who
accompanied
him
with
his
sword
drawn
in
his
hand
some
time
before
the
massacre
began
and
the
massacre
has
begun
an
hour
ago
thanks
madame
said
marguerite
and
although
perhaps
the
sentiment
which
impels
you
is
an
additional
offence
toward
me
yet
again
i
thank
you
oh
forgive
me
madame
she
said
and
i
will
return
to
my
apartments
stronger
for
your
pardon
for
i
dare
not
follow
you
even
at
a
distance
marguerite
extended
her
hand
to
her
i
will
go
to
queen
catharine
she
said
return
to
your
room
the
king
of
navarre
is
under
my
protection
i
have
promised
him
my
alliance
and
i
will
be
faithful
to
my
promise
but
suppose
you
can
not
obtain
access
to
the
queen
mother
madame
then
i
will
go
to
my
brother
charles
and
i
will
speak
to
him
go
madame
go
said
charlotte
leaving
marguerite
room
to
pass
and
may
god
guide
your
majesty
marguerite
darted
down
the
corridor
but
when
she
reached
the
end
of
it
she
turned
to
make
sure
that
madame
de
sauve
was
not
lingering
behind
madame
de
sauve
was
following
her
the
queen
of
navarre
saw
her
go
upstairs
to
her
own
apartment
and
then
she
herself
went
toward
the
queen
chamber
all
was
changed
here
instead
of
the
crowd
of
eager
courtiers
who
usually
opened
their
ranks
before
the
queen
and
respectfully
saluted
her
marguerite
met
only
guards
with
red
partisans
and
garments
stained
with
blood
or
gentlemen
in
torn
cloaks
their
faces
blackened
with
powder
bearing
orders
and
despatches
some
going
in
others
going
out
and
all
this
movement
back
and
forth
made
a
great
and
terrible
confusion
in
the
galleries
marguerite
however
went
boldly
on
until
she
reached
the
queen
antechamber
but
this
room
was
guarded
by
a
double
file
of
soldiers
who
allowed
only
those
who
had
a
certain
countersign
to
enter
marguerite
in
vain
tried
to
pass
this
living
barrier
several
times
she
saw
the
door
open
and
shut
and
each
time
she
saw
catharine
her
youth
restored
by
action
as
alert
as
if
she
were
only
twenty
years
of
age
writing
receiving
letters
opening
them
addressing
a
word
to
one
a
smile
to
another
and
those
on
whom
she
smiled
most
graciously
were
those
who
were
the
most
covered
with
dust
and
blood
amid
this
vast
tumult
which
reigned
in
the
louvre
and
filled
it
with
frightful
clamors
could
be
heard
the
rattling
of
musketry
more
and
more
insistently
repeated
i
shall
never
get
to
her
said
marguerite
to
herself
after
she
had
made
three
ineffectual
attempts
to
pass
the
halberdiers
rather
than
waste
my
time
here
i
must
go
and
find
my
brother
at
this
moment
de
guise
passed
he
had
just
informed
the
queen
of
the
murder
of
the
admiral
and
was
returning
to
the
butchery
oh
henry
cried
marguerite
where
is
the
king
of
navarre
the
duke
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
of
astonishment
bowed
and
without
any
reply
passed
out
with
his
guards
marguerite
ran
to
a
captain
who
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
louvre
and
was
engaged
in
having
his
men
arquebuses
loaded
the
king
of
navarre
she
exclaimed
sir
where
is
the
king
of
navarre
i
do
not
know
madame
replied
the
captain
i
do
not
belong
to
his
majesty
guards
ah
my
dear
réné
said
the
queen
recognizing
catharine
perfumer
is
that
you
you
have
just
left
my
mother
do
you
know
what
has
become
of
my
husband
his
majesty
the
king
of
navarre
is
no
friend
of
mine
madame
you
ought
to
remember
that
it
is
even
said
he
added
with
a
contraction
of
his
features
more
like
a
grimace
than
a
smile
it
is
even
said
that
he
ventures
to
accuse
me
of
having
been
the
accomplice
with
madame
catharine
in
poisoning
his
mother
no
no
cried
marguerite
my
good
réné
do
not
believe
that
oh
it
is
of
little
consequence
madame
said
the
perfumer
neither
the
king
of
navarre
nor
his
party
is
any
longer
to
be
feared
and
he
turned
his
back
on
marguerite
ah
monsieur
de
tavannes
cried
marguerite
one
word
i
beseech
you
tavannes
who
was
going
by
stopped
where
is
henry
of
navarre
faith
he
replied
in
a
loud
voice
i
believe
he
is
somewhere
in
the
city
with
the
messieurs
and
de
condé
and
then
he
added
in
a
tone
so
low
that
the
queen
alone
could
hear
your
majesty
if
you
would
see
him
to
be
in
whose
place
i
would
give
my
life
go
to
the
king
armory
thanks
tavannes
thanks
said
marguerite
who
of
all
that
tavannes
had
said
had
heard
only
the
chief
direction
thank
you
i
will
go
there
and
she
went
on
her
way
murmuring
oh
after
all
i
promised
him
after
the
way
in
which
he
behaved
to
me
when
that
ingrate
henry
de
guise
was
concealed
in
the
closet
i
can
not
let
him
perish
and
she
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
king
apartments
but
they
were
encompassed
within
by
two
companies
of
guards
no
one
is
admitted
to
the
king
said
the
officer
coming
forward
but
i
said
marguerite
the
order
is
general
i
the
queen
of
navarre
i
his
sister
my
orders
admit
of
no
exception
madame
i
pray
you
to
pardon
me
and
the
officer
closed
the
door
oh
he
is
lost
exclaimed
marguerite
alarmed
at
the
sight
of
all
those
sinister
faces
which
even
if
they
did
not
breathe
vengeance
expressed
sternness
of
purpose
yes
yes
i
comprehend
all
i
have
been
used
as
a
bait
i
am
the
snare
which
has
entrapped
the
huguenots
but
i
will
enter
if
i
am
killed
in
the
attempt
and
marguerite
ran
like
a
mad
creature
through
the
corridors
and
galleries
when
suddenly
as
she
passed
by
a
small
door
she
heard
a
sweet
song
almost
melancholy
so
monotonous
it
was
it
was
a
calvinistic
psalm
sung
by
a
trembling
voice
in
the
next
room
my
brother
the
king
nurse
the
good
madelon
she
is
there
exclaimed
marguerite
god
of
the
christians
aid
me
now
and
full
of
hope
marguerite
knocked
at
the
little
door
soon
after
the
counsel
which
marguerite
had
conveyed
to
him
after
his
conversation
with
réné
and
after
leaving
the
queen
mother
chamber
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
poor
little
phoebe
who
like
a
good
genius
tried
to
detain
him
henry
of
navarre
had
met
several
catholic
gentlemen
who
under
a
pretext
of
doing
him
honor
had
escorted
him
to
his
apartments
where
a
score
of
huguenots
awaited
him
who
had
rallied
round
the
young
prince
and
having
once
rallied
would
not
leave
him
so
strongly
for
some
hours
had
the
presentiment
of
that
fatal
night
weighed
on
the
louvre
they
had
remained
there
without
any
one
attempting
to
disturb
them
at
last
at
the
first
stroke
of
the
bell
of
which
resounded
through
all
hearts
like
a
funeral
knell
tavannes
entered
and
in
the
midst
of
a
silence
announced
that
king
charles
ix
desired
to
speak
to
henry
it
was
useless
to
attempt
resistance
and
no
one
thought
of
it
they
heard
the
ceilings
galleries
and
corridors
creaking
beneath
the
feet
of
the
assembled
soldiers
who
were
in
the
as
well
as
in
the
apartments
to
the
number
of
two
thousand
henry
after
having
taken
leave
of
his
friends
whom
he
was
never
again
to
see
followed
tavannes
who
led
him
to
a
small
gallery
next
the
king
apartments
where
he
left
him
alone
unarmed
and
a
prey
to
mistrust
the
king
of
navarre
counted
here
alone
minute
by
minute
two
mortal
hours
listening
with
increasing
alarm
to
the
sound
of
the
tocsin
and
the
discharge
of
seeing
through
a
small
window
by
the
light
of
the
flames
and
flambeaux
the
refugees
and
their
assassins
pass
understanding
nothing
of
these
shrieks
of
murder
these
cries
of
distress
not
even
suspecting
in
spite
of
his
knowledge
of
charles
the
queen
mother
and
the
duc
de
guise
the
horrible
drama
at
this
moment
enacting
henry
had
not
physical
courage
but
he
had
better
than
that
he
had
moral
fortitude
though
he
feared
danger
yet
he
smiled
at
it
and
faced
it
but
it
was
danger
in
the
field
of
battle
danger
in
the
open
air
danger
in
the
eyes
of
all
and
attended
by
the
noisy
harmony
of
trumpets
and
the
loud
and
vibrating
beat
of
drums
but
now
he
was
weaponless
alone
locked
in
shut
up
in
a
where
he
could
scarcely
see
the
enemy
that
might
glide
toward
him
and
the
weapon
that
might
be
raised
to
strike
him
these
two
hours
were
perhaps
the
most
agonizing
of
his
life
in
the
hottest
of
the
tumult
and
as
henry
was
beginning
to
understand
that
in
all
probability
this
was
some
organized
massacre
a
captain
came
to
him
and
conducted
the
prince
along
a
corridor
to
the
rooms
as
they
approached
the
door
opened
and
closed
behind
them
as
if
by
magic
the
captain
then
led
henry
to
the
king
who
was
in
his
armory
when
they
entered
the
king
was
seated
in
a
great
his
two
hands
placed
on
the
two
arms
of
the
seat
and
his
head
falling
on
his
chest
at
the
noise
made
by
their
entrance
charles
looked
up
and
henry
observed
the
perspiration
dropping
from
his
brow
like
large
beads
good
evening
harry
said
the
young
king
roughly
la
chastre
leave
us
the
captain
obeyed
a
gloomy
silence
ensued
henry
looked
around
him
with
uneasiness
and
saw
that
he
was
alone
with
the
king
charles
ix
suddenly
arose
la
mordieu
said
he
passing
his
hands
through
his
light
brown
hair
and
wiping
his
brow
at
the
same
time
you
are
glad
to
be
with
me
are
you
not
harry
certainly
sire
replied
the
king
of
navarre
i
am
always
happy
to
be
with
your
majesty
happier
than
if
you
were
down
there
eh
continued
charles
following
his
own
thoughts
rather
than
replying
to
henry
compliment
i
do
not
understand
sire
replied
henry
look
out
then
and
you
will
soon
understand
and
with
a
quick
movement
charles
stepped
or
rather
sprang
to
the
window
and
drawing
with
him
his
who
became
more
and
more
he
pointed
to
him
the
horrible
outlines
of
the
assassins
who
on
the
deck
of
a
boat
were
cutting
the
throats
or
drowning
the
victims
brought
them
at
every
moment
in
the
name
of
heaven
cried
henry
what
is
going
on
sir
replied
charles
they
are
ridding
me
of
all
the
huguenots
look
yonder
over
the
hôtel
de
bourbon
at
the
smoke
and
flames
they
are
the
smoke
and
flames
of
the
admiral
house
which
is
on
fire
do
you
see
that
body
which
these
good
catholics
are
drawing
on
a
torn
mattress
it
is
the
corpse
of
the
admiral
the
carcass
of
your
friend
téligny
what
means
this
cried
the
king
of
navarre
seeking
vainly
by
his
side
for
the
hilt
of
his
dagger
and
trembling
equally
with
shame
and
anger
for
he
felt
that
he
was
at
the
same
time
laughed
at
and
threatened
it
means
cried
charles
becoming
suddenly
furious
and
turning
frightfully
pale
it
means
that
i
will
no
longer
have
any
huguenots
about
me
do
you
hear
me
henry
am
i
king
am
i
master
but
your
majesty
my
majesty
kills
and
massacres
at
this
moment
all
that
is
not
catholic
it
is
my
pleasure
are
you
a
catholic
exclaimed
charles
whose
anger
was
rising
higher
and
higher
like
an
awful
tide
sire
replied
henry
do
you
remember
your
own
words
matters
the
religion
of
those
who
serve
me
well
ha
ha
ha
cried
charles
bursting
into
a
ferocious
laugh
you
ask
me
if
i
remember
my
words
henry
as
my
sister
margot
says
and
had
not
all
those
and
he
pointed
to
the
city
with
his
finger
served
me
well
also
were
they
not
brave
in
battle
wise
in
council
deeply
devoted
they
were
all
useful
subjects
but
they
were
huguenots
and
i
want
none
but
catholics
henry
remained
silent
do
you
understand
me
now
harry
asked
charles
i
understand
sire
well
well
sire
i
do
not
see
why
the
king
of
navarre
should
not
do
what
so
many
gentlemen
and
poor
folk
have
done
for
if
they
all
die
poor
unfortunates
it
is
because
the
same
terms
have
been
proposed
to
them
which
your
majesty
proposes
to
me
and
they
have
refused
as
i
refuse
charles
seized
the
young
prince
arm
and
fixed
on
him
a
look
the
vacancy
of
which
suddenly
changed
into
a
fierce
and
savage
scowl
what
he
said
do
you
believe
that
i
have
taken
the
trouble
to
offer
the
mass
to
those
whose
throats
we
are
cutting
yonder
sire
said
henry
disengaging
his
arm
will
you
not
die
in
the
religion
of
your
fathers
yes
la
and
you
well
sire
i
will
do
the
same
replied
henry
charles
uttered
a
roar
of
rage
and
with
trembling
hand
seized
his
arquebuse
which
lay
on
the
table
henry
who
stood
leaning
against
the
tapestry
with
the
perspiration
on
his
brow
and
nevertheless
owing
to
his
presence
of
mind
calm
to
all
appearance
followed
every
movement
of
the
terrible
king
with
the
greedy
stupefaction
of
a
bird
fascinated
by
a
serpent
charles
cocked
his
arquebuse
and
stamping
with
blind
rage
cried
as
he
dazzled
henry
eyes
with
the
polished
barrel
of
the
deadly
gun
will
you
accept
the
mass
henry
remained
mute
charles
ix
shook
the
vaults
of
the
louvre
with
the
most
terrible
oath
that
ever
issued
from
the
lips
of
man
and
grew
even
more
livid
than
before
death
mass
or
the
bastille
he
cried
taking
aim
at
the
king
of
navarre
oh
sire
exclaimed
henry
will
you
kill
me
me
your
brother
henry
thus
by
his
incomparable
cleverness
which
was
one
of
the
strongest
faculties
of
his
organization
evaded
the
answer
which
charles
ix
expected
for
undoubtedly
had
his
reply
been
in
the
negative
henry
had
been
a
dead
man
as
immediately
after
the
climax
of
rage
reaction
begins
charles
ix
did
not
repeat
the
question
he
had
addressed
to
the
prince
of
navarre
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
during
which
he
uttered
a
hoarse
kind
of
growl
he
went
back
to
the
open
window
and
aimed
at
a
man
who
was
running
along
the
quay
in
front
i
must
kill
some
one
cried
charles
ghastly
as
a
corpse
his
eyes
suffused
with
blood
and
firing
as
he
spoke
he
struck
the
man
who
was
running
henry
uttered
a
groan
then
animated
by
a
frightful
ardor
charles
loaded
and
fired
his
arquebuse
without
cessation
uttering
cries
of
joy
every
time
his
aim
was
successful
it
is
all
over
with
me
said
the
king
of
navarre
to
himself
when
he
sees
no
one
else
to
kill
he
will
kill
me
well
said
a
voice
behind
the
princes
suddenly
is
it
done
it
was
catharine
de
médicis
who
had
entered
unobserved
just
as
the
king
was
firing
his
last
shot
no
thousand
thunders
of
hell
said
the
king
throwing
his
arquebuse
across
the
room
no
the
obstinate
blockhead
he
will
not
consent
catharine
made
no
reply
she
turned
her
eyes
slowly
where
henry
stood
as
motionless
as
one
of
the
figures
of
the
tapestry
against
which
he
was
leaning
she
then
gave
a
glance
at
the
king
which
seemed
to
say
then
why
he
is
alive
he
is
alive
he
is
alive
murmured
charles
who
perfectly
understood
the
glance
and
replied
to
it
without
hesitation
he
is
alive
because
he
is
my
relative
catharine
smiled
henry
saw
the
smile
and
realized
that
his
struggle
was
to
be
with
catharine
madame
he
said
to
her
the
whole
thing
comes
from
you
i
see
very
well
and
my
charles
is
not
to
blame
you
laid
the
plan
for
drawing
me
into
a
snare
you
made
your
daughter
the
bait
which
was
to
destroy
us
all
you
separated
me
from
my
wife
that
she
might
not
see
me
killed
before
her
eyes
yes
but
that
shall
not
be
cried
another
voice
breathless
and
impassioned
which
henry
instantly
recognized
and
which
made
charles
start
with
surprise
and
catharine
with
rage
marguerite
exclaimed
henry
margot
said
charles
ix
my
daughter
muttered
catharine
sire
said
marguerite
to
henry
your
last
words
were
an
accusation
against
me
and
you
were
both
right
and
wrong
right
for
i
am
the
means
by
which
they
attempted
to
destroy
you
wrong
for
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
going
to
your
destruction
i
sire
owe
my
own
life
to
chance
to
my
mother
forgetfulness
perhaps
but
as
soon
as
i
learned
your
danger
i
remembered
my
duty
and
a
wife
duty
is
to
share
her
husband
fortunes
if
you
are
exiled
sire
i
will
follow
you
into
exile
if
you
are
put
into
prison
i
will
be
your
if
they
kill
you
i
will
also
die
and
she
offered
her
husband
her
hand
which
he
eagerly
seized
if
not
with
love
at
least
with
gratitude
oh
my
poor
margot
said
charles
you
had
much
better
bid
him
become
a
catholic
sire
replied
marguerite
with
that
lofty
dignity
which
was
so
natural
to
her
for
your
own
sake
do
not
ask
any
prince
of
your
house
to
commit
a
cowardly
act
catharine
darted
a
significant
glance
at
charles
brother
cried
marguerite
who
equally
well
with
charles
ix
understood
catharine
ominous
pantomime
my
brother
remember
you
made
him
my
husband
charles
at
bay
between
catharine
commanding
eyes
and
supplicating
look
as
if
between
the
two
opposing
principles
of
good
and
evil
stood
for
an
instant
undecided
at
last
ormazd
won
the
day
in
truth
said
he
whispering
in
catharine
ear
margot
is
right
and
harry
is
my
yes
replied
catharine
in
a
similar
whisper
in
her
son
ear
yes
but
supposing
he
were
not
chapter
xi
the
hawthorn
of
the
cemetery
of
the
innocents
as
soon
as
marguerite
reached
her
own
apartments
she
tried
in
vain
to
divine
the
words
which
catharine
de
médicis
had
whispered
to
charles
and
which
had
cut
short
the
terrible
council
of
life
and
death
which
was
taking
place
she
spent
a
part
of
the
morning
in
attending
to
la
mole
and
the
rest
in
trying
to
guess
the
enigma
which
her
mind
could
not
discover
the
king
of
navarre
remained
a
prisoner
in
the
louvre
the
persecution
of
the
huguenots
went
on
hotter
than
ever
the
terrible
night
was
followed
by
a
day
of
massacre
still
more
horrible
no
longer
the
bells
rang
the
tocsin
but
and
the
echoes
of
these
joyous
notes
resounding
amid
fire
and
slaughter
were
perhaps
even
more
lugubrious
in
sunlight
than
had
been
the
last
night
knell
sounding
in
darkness
this
was
not
all
a
strange
thing
had
happened
a
which
had
blossomed
in
the
spring
and
which
as
usual
had
lost
its
odorous
flowers
in
the
month
of
june
had
blossomed
again
during
the
night
and
the
catholics
who
saw
a
miracle
in
this
event
spread
the
report
of
the
miracle
far
and
wide
thus
making
god
their
accomplice
and
with
cross
and
banners
they
marched
in
a
procession
to
the
cemetery
of
the
innocents
where
this
was
blooming
this
method
of
acquiescence
which
heaven
seemed
to
show
in
the
massacres
redoubled
the
ardor
of
the
assassins
and
while
every
street
every
square
every
of
the
city
continued
to
present
a
scene
of
desolation
the
louvre
had
become
the
common
tomb
for
all
protestants
who
had
been
shut
up
there
when
the
signal
was
given
the
king
of
navarre
the
prince
de
condé
and
la
mole
were
the
only
survivors
assured
as
to
la
mole
whose
wounds
as
she
had
declared
the
evening
before
were
severe
but
not
dangerous
marguerite
mind
was
now
occupied
with
one
single
idea
that
was
to
save
her
husband
life
which
was
still
threatened
no
doubt
the
first
sentiment
which
actuated
the
wife
was
one
of
generous
pity
for
a
man
for
whom
as
the
béarnais
himself
had
said
she
had
sworn
if
not
love
at
least
alliance
but
there
was
beside
another
sentiment
not
so
pure
which
had
penetrated
the
queen
heart
marguerite
was
ambitious
and
had
foreseen
almost
the
certainty
of
royalty
in
her
marriage
with
henry
de
bourbon
navarre
though
beset
on
one
side
by
the
kings
of
france
and
on
the
other
by
the
kings
of
spain
who
strip
by
strip
had
absorbed
half
of
its
territory
might
become
a
real
kingdom
with
the
french
huguenots
for
subjects
if
only
henry
de
bourbon
should
fulfil
the
hopes
which
the
courage
shown
by
him
on
the
infrequent
occasions
vouchsafed
him
of
drawing
his
sword
had
aroused
marguerite
with
her
keen
lofty
intellect
foresaw
and
reckoned
on
all
this
so
if
she
lost
henry
she
lost
not
only
a
husband
but
a
throne
as
she
was
absorbed
in
these
reflections
she
heard
some
one
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
secret
corridor
she
started
for
only
three
persons
came
by
that
door
the
king
the
queen
mother
and
the
duc
she
opened
the
closet
door
made
a
gesture
of
silence
to
gillonne
and
la
mole
and
then
went
to
let
her
visitor
in
it
was
the
duc
the
young
prince
had
not
been
seen
since
the
night
before
for
a
moment
marguerite
had
conceived
the
idea
of
asking
his
intercession
for
the
king
of
navarre
but
a
terrible
idea
restrained
her
the
marriage
had
taken
place
against
his
wishes
françois
detested
henry
and
had
evinced
his
neutrality
toward
the
béarnais
only
because
he
was
convinced
that
henry
and
his
wife
had
remained
strangers
to
each
other
a
mark
of
interest
shown
by
marguerite
in
her
husband
might
thrust
one
of
the
three
threatening
poniards
into
his
heart
instead
of
turning
it
aside
marguerite
therefore
on
perceiving
the
young
prince
shuddered
more
than
she
had
shuddered
at
seeing
the
king
or
even
the
queen
mother
nevertheless
no
one
could
have
told
by
his
appearance
that
anything
unusual
was
taking
place
either
in
the
city
or
at
the
louvre
he
was
dressed
with
his
usual
elegance
his
clothes
and
linen
breathed
of
those
perfumes
which
charles
ix
despised
but
of
which
the
duc
and
he
made
continual
use
a
practised
eye
like
marguerite
however
could
detect
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
his
rather
unusual
pallor
and
in
spite
of
a
slight
trembling
in
his
hands
delicate
hands
as
carefully
treated
as
a
lady
he
felt
a
deep
sense
of
joy
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
his
entrance
was
in
no
wise
different
from
usual
he
went
to
his
sister
to
kiss
her
but
marguerite
instead
of
offering
him
her
cheek
as
she
would
have
done
had
it
been
king
charles
or
the
duc
made
a
courtesy
and
allowed
him
to
kiss
her
forehead
the
duc
sighed
and
touched
his
bloodless
lips
to
her
brow
then
taking
a
seat
he
began
to
tell
his
sister
the
sanguinary
news
of
the
night
the
admiral
lingering
and
terrible
death
instantaneous
death
caused
by
a
bullet
he
took
his
time
and
emphasized
all
the
bloody
details
of
that
night
with
that
love
of
blood
characteristic
of
himself
and
his
two
brothers
marguerite
allowed
him
to
tell
his
story
you
did
not
come
to
tell
me
this
only
brother
she
then
asked
the
duc
smiled
you
have
something
else
to
say
to
me
no
replied
the
duke
i
am
waiting
waiting
for
what
have
you
not
told
me
dearest
marguerite
said
the
duke
drawing
his
armchair
close
up
to
his
sister
that
your
marriage
with
the
king
of
navarre
was
contracted
against
your
wishes
yes
no
doubt
i
did
not
know
the
prince
of
béarn
when
he
was
proposed
to
me
as
a
husband
and
after
you
came
to
know
him
did
you
not
tell
me
that
you
felt
no
love
for
him
i
told
you
so
it
is
true
was
it
not
your
opinion
that
this
marriage
would
make
you
unhappy
my
dear
françois
said
marguerite
when
a
marriage
is
not
the
height
of
happiness
it
is
almost
always
the
depth
of
wretchedness
well
then
my
dear
marguerite
as
i
said
to
you
i
am
waiting
but
what
are
you
waiting
for
for
you
to
display
your
joy
what
have
i
to
be
joyful
for
the
unexpected
chance
which
offers
itself
for
you
to
resume
your
liberty
my
liberty
replied
marguerite
who
was
determined
to
compel
the
prince
to
express
his
whole
thought
yes
your
liberty
you
will
now
be
separated
from
the
king
of
navarre
separated
said
marguerite
fastening
her
eyes
on
the
young
prince
the
duc
tried
to
endure
his
sister
look
but
his
eyes
soon
avoided
hers
with
embarrassment
separated
repeated
marguerite
let
us
talk
this
over
brother
for
i
should
like
to
understand
all
you
mean
and
how
you
propose
to
separate
us
why
murmured
the
duke
henry
is
a
huguenot
no
doubt
but
he
made
no
secret
of
his
religion
and
that
was
known
when
we
were
married
yes
but
since
your
marriage
sister
asked
the
duke
involuntarily
allowing
a
ray
of
joy
to
shine
upon
his
face
what
has
henry
been
doing
why
you
know
better
than
any
one
françois
for
he
has
spent
his
days
almost
constantly
in
your
society
either
hunting
or
playing
mall
or
tennis
yes
his
days
no
doubt
replied
the
duke
his
days
but
his
nights
marguerite
was
silent
it
was
now
her
turn
to
cast
down
her
eyes
his
nights
persisted
the
duc
his
nights
well
inquired
marguerite
feeling
that
it
was
requisite
that
she
should
say
something
in
reply
well
he
has
been
spending
them
with
madame
de
sauve
how
do
you
know
that
exclaimed
marguerite
i
know
it
because
i
have
an
interest
in
knowing
it
replied
the
young
prince
growing
pale
and
picking
the
embroidery
of
his
sleeves
marguerite
began
to
understand
what
catharine
had
whispered
to
charles
but
pretended
to
remain
in
ignorance
why
do
you
tell
me
this
brother
she
replied
with
a
air
of
melancholy
was
it
to
remind
me
that
no
one
here
loves
me
or
takes
my
part
neither
those
whom
nature
gave
me
as
protectors
nor
the
man
whom
the
church
gave
me
as
my
husband
you
are
unjust
said
the
duc
drawing
his
armchair
still
nearer
to
his
sister
i
love
you
and
protect
you
brother
said
marguerite
looking
at
him
sharply
have
you
anything
to
say
to
me
from
the
queen
mother
i
you
mistake
sister
i
swear
to
you
what
can
make
you
think
that
what
can
make
me
think
that
why
because
you
are
breaking
off
the
intimacy
that
binds
you
to
my
husband
because
you
are
abandoning
the
cause
of
the
king
of
navarre
the
cause
of
the
king
of
navarre
replied
the
duc
wholly
at
his
wits
end
yes
certainly
now
look
here
françois
let
us
speak
frankly
you
have
come
to
an
agreement
a
score
of
times
you
can
not
raise
yourself
or
even
hold
your
own
except
by
mutual
help
this
alliance
has
now
become
impossible
sister
interrupted
the
duc
and
why
so
because
the
king
has
designs
on
your
husband
pardon
me
when
i
said
i
erred
i
meant
henry
of
navarre
our
mother
has
seen
through
the
whole
thing
i
entered
into
an
alliance
with
the
huguenots
because
i
believed
the
huguenots
were
in
favor
but
now
they
are
killing
the
huguenots
and
in
another
week
there
will
not
remain
fifty
in
the
whole
kingdom
i
gave
my
hand
to
the
king
of
navarre
because
he
was
your
husband
but
now
he
is
not
your
husband
what
can
you
say
to
that
you
who
are
not
only
the
loveliest
woman
in
france
but
have
the
clearest
head
in
the
kingdom
why
i
have
this
to
say
replied
marguerite
i
know
our
brother
charles
i
saw
him
yesterday
in
one
of
those
fits
of
frenzy
every
one
of
which
shortens
his
life
ten
years
i
have
to
say
that
unfortunately
these
attacks
are
very
frequent
and
that
thus
in
all
probability
our
brother
charles
has
not
very
long
to
live
and
finally
i
have
to
say
that
the
king
of
poland
has
just
died
and
the
question
of
electing
a
prince
of
the
house
of
france
in
his
stead
is
much
discussed
and
when
circumstances
are
thus
it
is
not
the
moment
to
abandon
allies
who
in
the
moment
of
struggle
might
support
us
with
the
strength
of
a
nation
and
the
power
of
a
kingdom
and
you
exclaimed
the
duke
do
you
not
act
much
more
treasonably
to
me
in
preferring
a
foreigner
to
your
own
brother
explain
yourself
françois
in
what
have
i
acted
treasonably
to
you
you
yesterday
begged
the
life
of
the
king
of
navarre
from
king
charles
well
said
marguerite
with
pretended
innocence
the
duke
rose
hastily
paced
round
the
chamber
twice
or
thrice
with
a
bewildered
air
then
came
back
and
took
marguerite
hand
it
was
cold
and
unresponsive
sister
he
said
at
last
you
will
not
understand
me
do
not
therefore
complain
of
whatever
misfortunes
may
happen
to
you
marguerite
grew
pale
but
remained
motionless
in
her
place
she
saw
the
duc
go
away
without
making
any
attempt
to
detain
him
but
he
had
scarcely
more
than
disappeared
down
the
corridor
when
he
returned
listen
marguerite
he
said
i
had
forgotten
to
tell
you
one
thing
that
is
that
by
this
time
the
king
of
navarre
will
be
dead
marguerite
uttered
a
cry
for
the
idea
that
she
was
the
instrument
of
assassination
caused
in
her
a
terror
she
could
not
subdue
and
you
will
not
prevent
his
death
she
said
you
will
not
save
your
best
and
most
faithful
ally
since
yesterday
the
king
of
navarre
is
no
longer
my
ally
who
is
pray
monsieur
de
guise
by
destroying
the
huguenots
monsieur
de
guise
has
become
the
king
of
the
catholics
and
does
a
son
of
henry
ii
recognize
a
duke
of
lorraine
as
his
king
you
are
in
a
bad
frame
of
mind
marguerite
and
you
do
not
understand
anything
i
confess
that
i
try
in
vain
to
read
your
thoughts
sister
you
are
of
as
good
a
house
as
the
princesse
de
porcian
de
guise
is
no
more
immortal
than
the
king
of
navarre
now
then
marguerite
suppose
three
things
three
possibilities
first
suppose
monsieur
is
chosen
king
of
poland
the
second
that
you
loved
me
as
i
love
you
well
i
am
king
of
france
and
you
are
queen
of
the
catholics
marguerite
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
overwhelmed
at
the
depth
of
the
views
of
this
youth
whom
no
one
at
court
thought
possessed
of
even
common
understanding
but
she
asked
after
a
moment
silence
i
hope
you
are
not
jealous
of
monsieur
le
duc
de
guise
as
you
were
of
the
king
of
navarre
what
is
done
is
done
said
the
duc
in
a
muffled
voice
and
if
i
had
to
be
jealous
of
the
duc
de
guise
well
then
i
was
there
is
only
one
thing
that
can
prevent
this
capital
plan
from
succeeding
brother
and
what
is
that
that
i
no
longer
love
the
duc
de
guise
and
whom
pray
do
you
love
no
one
the
duc
looked
at
marguerite
with
the
astonishment
of
a
man
who
takes
his
turn
in
failing
to
understand
and
left
the
room
pressing
his
icy
hand
on
his
forehead
which
ached
to
bursting
marguerite
remained
alone
and
thoughtful
the
situation
was
beginning
to
take
a
clear
and
definite
shape
before
her
eyes
the
king
had
permitted
saint
bartholomew
queen
catharine
and
the
duc
de
guise
had
put
it
into
execution
the
duc
de
guise
and
the
duc
were
about
to
join
partnership
so
as
to
get
the
greatest
possible
advantage
the
death
of
the
king
of
navarre
would
be
a
natural
result
of
this
great
catastrophe
with
the
king
of
navarre
out
of
the
way
his
kingdom
would
be
seized
upon
marguerite
would
be
left
a
throneless
impotent
widow
with
no
other
prospect
before
her
than
a
nunnery
where
she
would
not
even
have
the
sad
consolation
of
weeping
for
a
consort
who
had
never
been
her
husband
she
was
still
in
the
same
position
when
queen
catharine
sent
to
ask
if
she
would
not
like
to
go
with
her
and
the
whole
court
on
a
pious
visitation
to
the
hawthorn
of
the
cemetery
of
the
innocents
marguerite
first
impulse
was
to
refuse
to
take
part
in
this
cavalcade
but
the
thought
that
this
excursion
might
possibly
give
her
a
chance
to
learn
something
new
about
the
king
of
navarre
fate
decided
her
to
go
so
she
sent
word
that
if
they
would
have
a
palfrey
ready
for
her
she
would
willingly
go
with
their
majesties
five
minutes
later
a
page
came
to
ask
if
she
was
ready
to
go
down
for
the
procession
was
preparing
to
start
marguerite
warned
gillonne
by
a
gesture
to
look
after
the
wounded
man
and
so
went
downstairs
the
king
the
queen
mother
tavannes
and
the
principal
catholics
were
already
mounted
marguerite
cast
a
rapid
glance
over
the
group
which
was
composed
of
about
a
score
of
persons
the
king
of
navarre
was
not
of
the
party
madame
de
sauve
was
there
marguerite
exchanged
a
glance
with
her
and
was
convinced
that
her
husband
mistress
had
something
to
tell
her
they
rode
down
the
rue
de
and
entered
into
the
rue
saint
honoré
as
the
populace
caught
sight
of
the
king
queen
catharine
and
the
principal
catholics
they
flocked
together
and
followed
the
procession
like
a
rising
tide
and
shouts
rent
the
air
le
roi
la
death
to
the
huguenots
these
acclamations
were
accompanied
by
the
waving
of
ensanguined
swords
and
smoking
arquebuses
which
showed
the
part
each
had
taken
in
the
awful
work
just
accomplished
when
they
reached
the
top
of
the
rue
des
prouvelles
they
met
some
men
who
were
dragging
a
headless
carcass
it
was
the
admiral
the
men
were
going
to
hang
it
by
the
feet
at
montfaucon
they
entered
the
cemetery
des
saints
innocents
by
the
gate
facing
the
rue
des
chaps
now
known
as
the
rue
des
déchargeurs
the
clergy
notified
in
advance
of
the
visit
of
the
king
and
the
queen
mother
were
waiting
for
their
majesties
to
make
them
speeches
madame
de
sauve
took
advantage
of
a
moment
when
catharine
was
listening
to
one
of
the
discourses
to
approach
the
queen
of
navarre
and
beg
leave
to
kiss
her
hand
marguerite
extended
her
arm
toward
her
and
madame
de
sauve
as
she
kissed
the
queen
hand
slipped
a
tiny
roll
of
paper
up
her
sleeve
madame
de
sauve
drew
back
quickly
and
with
clever
dissimulation
yet
catharine
perceived
it
and
turned
round
just
as
the
maid
of
honor
was
kissing
marguerite
hand
the
two
women
saw
her
glance
which
penetrated
them
like
a
flash
of
lightning
but
both
remained
unmoved
only
madame
de
sauve
left
marguerite
and
resumed
her
place
near
catharine
when
catharine
had
finished
replying
to
the
address
which
had
just
been
made
to
her
she
smiled
and
beckoned
the
queen
of
navarre
to
go
to
her
eh
my
daughter
said
the
queen
mother
in
her
italian
patois
so
you
are
on
intimate
terms
with
madame
de
sauve
are
you
marguerite
smiled
in
turn
and
gave
to
her
lovely
countenance
the
bitterest
expression
she
could
and
replied
yes
mother
the
serpent
came
to
bite
my
hand
aha
replied
catharine
with
a
smile
you
are
jealous
i
think
you
are
mistaken
madame
replied
marguerite
i
am
no
more
jealous
of
the
king
of
navarre
than
the
king
of
navarre
is
in
love
with
me
but
i
know
how
to
distinguish
my
friends
from
my
enemies
i
like
those
that
like
me
and
detest
those
that
hate
me
otherwise
madame
should
i
be
your
daughter
catharine
smiled
so
as
to
make
marguerite
understand
that
if
she
had
had
any
suspicion
it
had
vanished
moreover
at
that
instant
the
arrival
of
other
pilgrims
attracted
the
attention
of
the
august
throng
the
duc
de
guise
came
with
a
troop
of
gentlemen
all
warm
still
from
recent
carnage
they
escorted
a
richly
decorated
litter
which
stopped
in
front
of
the
king
the
duchesse
de
nevers
cried
charles
ah
let
that
lovely
robust
catholic
come
and
receive
our
compliments
why
they
tell
me
cousin
that
from
your
own
window
you
have
been
hunting
huguenots
and
that
you
killed
one
with
a
stone
the
duchesse
de
nevers
blushed
exceedingly
red
sire
she
said
in
a
low
tone
and
kneeling
before
the
king
on
the
contrary
it
was
a
wounded
catholic
whom
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
rescue
good
good
my
cousin
there
are
two
ways
of
serving
me
one
is
by
exterminating
my
enemies
the
other
is
by
rescuing
my
friends
one
does
what
one
can
and
i
am
certain
that
if
you
could
have
done
more
you
would
while
this
was
going
on
the
populace
seeing
the
harmony
existing
between
the
house
of
lorraine
and
charles
shouted
exultantly
le
roi
le
duc
de
guise
la
messe
do
you
return
to
the
louvre
with
us
henriette
inquired
the
queen
mother
of
the
lovely
duchess
marguerite
touched
her
friend
on
the
elbow
and
she
understanding
the
sign
replied
no
madame
unless
your
majesty
desire
it
for
i
have
business
in
the
city
with
her
majesty
the
queen
of
navarre
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
together
inquired
catharine
to
see
some
very
rare
and
curious
greek
books
found
at
an
old
protestant
pastor
and
which
have
been
taken
to
the
tower
of
saint
jacques
la
boucherie
replied
marguerite
you
would
do
much
better
to
see
the
last
huguenots
flung
into
the
seine
from
the
top
of
the
pont
des
meuniers
said
charles
ix
that
is
the
place
for
all
good
frenchmen
we
will
go
if
it
be
your
majesty
desire
replied
the
duchesse
de
nevers
catharine
cast
a
look
of
distrust
on
the
two
young
women
marguerite
on
the
watch
remarked
it
and
turning
round
uneasily
looked
about
her
this
assumed
or
real
anxiety
did
not
escape
catharine
what
are
you
looking
for
i
am
seeking
i
do
not
see
she
replied
whom
are
you
seeking
who
is
it
you
fail
to
see
la
sauve
said
marguerite
can
she
have
returned
to
the
louvre
did
i
not
say
you
were
jealous
said
catharine
in
her
daughter
ear
oh
come
come
henriette
she
added
shrugging
her
shoulders
begone
and
take
the
queen
of
navarre
with
you
marguerite
pretended
to
be
still
looking
about
her
then
turning
to
her
friend
she
said
in
a
whisper
take
me
away
quickly
i
have
something
of
the
greatest
importance
to
say
to
you
the
duchess
courtesied
to
the
king
and
queen
mother
and
then
bowing
low
before
the
queen
of
navarre
will
your
majesty
deign
to
come
into
my
litter
willingly
only
you
will
have
to
take
me
back
to
the
louvre
my
litter
like
my
servants
and
myself
are
at
your
majesty
orders
queen
marguerite
entered
the
litter
while
catharine
and
her
gentlemen
returned
to
the
louvre
just
as
they
had
come
but
during
the
route
it
was
observed
that
the
queen
mother
kept
talking
to
the
king
pointing
several
times
to
madame
de
sauve
and
at
each
time
the
king
laughed
as
charles
ix
laughed
that
is
with
a
laugh
more
sinister
than
a
threat
as
soon
as
marguerite
felt
the
litter
in
motion
and
had
no
longer
to
fear
catharine
searching
eyes
she
quickly
drew
from
her
sleeve
madame
de
sauve
note
and
read
as
follows
have
received
orders
to
send
to
the
king
of
navarre
two
keys
one
is
that
of
the
room
in
which
he
is
shut
up
and
the
other
is
the
key
of
my
chamber
when
once
he
has
reached
my
apartment
i
am
enjoined
to
keep
him
there
until
six
in
the
your
majesty
reflect
let
your
majesty
decide
let
your
majesty
esteem
my
life
as
there
is
now
no
doubt
murmured
marguerite
and
the
poor
woman
is
the
tool
of
which
they
wish
to
make
use
to
destroy
us
all
but
we
will
see
if
the
queen
margot
as
my
brother
charles
calls
me
is
so
easily
to
be
made
a
nun
of
tell
me
whom
is
the
letter
from
asked
the
duchesse
de
nevers
ah
duchess
i
have
so
many
things
to
say
to
you
replied
marguerite
tearing
the
note
into
a
thousand
bits
chapter
xii
mutual
confidences
and
first
where
are
we
going
asked
marguerite
not
to
the
pont
des
meuniers
i
suppose
i
have
seen
enough
slaughter
since
yesterday
my
poor
henriette
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
conduct
your
majesty
first
and
foremost
my
majesty
requests
you
to
forget
my
majesty
you
were
taking
me
to
the
hôtel
de
guise
unless
you
decide
otherwise
no
no
let
us
go
there
henriette
the
duc
de
guise
is
not
there
your
husband
is
not
there
oh
no
cried
the
duchess
her
bright
emerald
eyes
sparkling
with
joy
no
neither
my
husband
nor
my
nor
any
one
else
i
am
free
free
as
air
free
as
a
bird
free
my
queen
do
you
understand
the
happiness
there
is
in
that
word
i
go
i
come
i
command
ah
poor
queen
you
are
not
free
and
so
you
sigh
you
go
you
come
you
command
is
that
all
is
that
all
the
use
of
liberty
you
are
happy
with
only
freedom
as
an
excuse
your
majesty
promised
to
tell
me
a
secret
again
majesty
i
shall
be
angry
soon
henriette
have
you
forgotten
our
agreement
no
your
respectful
servant
in
public
in
private
your
madcap
confidante
is
it
not
so
madame
is
it
not
so
marguerite
yes
yes
said
the
queen
smiling
no
family
rivalry
no
treachery
in
love
everything
fair
open
and
aboveboard
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
for
the
sole
purpose
of
finding
and
if
we
can
catching
on
the
fly
that
ephemeral
thing
called
happiness
just
so
duchess
let
us
again
seal
the
compact
with
a
kiss
and
the
two
beautiful
women
the
one
so
pale
so
full
of
melancholy
the
other
so
roseate
so
fair
so
animated
joined
their
lips
as
they
had
united
their
thoughts
tell
me
what
is
there
new
asked
the
duchess
giving
marguerite
an
eager
inquisitive
look
is
everything
new
since
day
before
yesterday
oh
i
am
speaking
of
love
not
of
politics
when
we
are
as
old
as
dame
catharine
we
will
take
part
in
politics
but
we
are
only
twenty
my
pretty
queen
and
so
let
us
talk
about
something
else
let
me
see
can
it
be
that
you
are
really
married
to
whom
asked
marguerite
laughing
ah
you
reassure
me
truly
well
henriette
that
which
reassures
you
alarms
me
duchess
i
must
be
married
when
oh
poor
little
friend
and
is
it
necessary
absolutely
as
an
acquaintance
of
mine
says
this
is
very
sad
and
so
you
know
some
one
who
says
asked
marguerite
with
a
smile
yes
and
who
is
this
some
one
you
keep
asking
me
questions
when
i
am
talking
to
you
finish
and
i
will
begin
in
two
words
it
is
this
the
king
of
navarre
is
in
love
and
not
with
me
i
am
not
in
love
but
i
do
not
want
him
yet
we
must
both
of
us
change
or
seem
to
change
between
now
and
well
then
you
change
and
be
very
sure
he
will
do
the
same
that
is
quite
impossible
for
i
am
less
than
ever
inclined
to
change
only
with
respect
to
your
husband
i
hope
henriette
i
have
a
scruple
a
scruple
about
what
a
religious
one
do
you
make
any
difference
between
huguenots
and
catholics
in
politics
yes
of
course
and
in
love
my
dear
girl
we
women
are
such
heathens
that
we
admit
every
kind
of
sect
and
recognize
many
gods
in
one
eh
yes
replied
the
duchess
her
eyes
sparkling
he
who
is
called
he
who
has
a
quiver
on
his
back
wings
on
his
shoulders
and
a
fillet
over
his
eyes
vive
la
dévotion
you
have
a
peculiar
method
of
praying
you
throw
stones
on
the
heads
of
huguenots
let
us
do
our
duty
and
let
people
talk
ah
marguerite
how
the
finest
ideas
the
noblest
actions
are
spoilt
in
passing
through
the
mouths
of
the
vulgar
the
vulgar
why
it
was
my
brother
charles
who
congratulated
you
on
your
exploits
was
it
your
brother
charles
is
a
mighty
hunter
blowing
the
horn
all
day
and
that
makes
him
very
thin
i
reject
his
compliments
besides
i
gave
him
his
answer
did
you
hear
what
i
said
no
you
spoke
so
low
so
much
the
better
i
shall
have
more
news
to
tell
you
now
then
finish
your
story
marguerite
i
was
going
to
say
to
say
well
i
was
going
to
say
continued
the
queen
laughing
if
the
stone
my
brother
spoke
of
be
a
fact
i
should
resist
ah
cried
henriette
so
you
have
chosen
a
huguenot
have
you
well
to
reassure
your
conscience
i
promise
you
that
i
will
choose
one
myself
on
the
first
opportunity
ah
so
you
have
chosen
a
catholic
have
you
replied
the
duchess
i
see
i
see
and
what
is
this
huguenot
of
yours
i
did
not
choose
him
the
young
man
is
nothing
and
probably
never
will
be
anything
to
me
but
what
sort
is
he
you
can
tell
me
that
you
know
how
curious
i
am
about
these
matters
a
poor
young
fellow
beautiful
as
benvenuto
cellini
nisus
and
he
came
and
took
refuge
in
my
room
oho
of
course
without
any
suggestion
on
your
part
poor
fellow
do
not
laugh
so
henriette
at
this
very
moment
he
is
between
life
and
death
he
is
ill
is
he
he
is
grievously
wounded
a
wounded
huguenot
is
very
disagreeable
especially
in
these
times
and
what
have
you
done
with
this
wounded
huguenot
who
is
not
and
never
will
be
anything
to
you
he
is
in
my
closet
i
am
concealing
him
and
i
want
to
save
him
he
is
handsome
he
is
young
he
is
wounded
you
hide
him
in
your
closet
you
want
to
save
him
this
huguenot
of
yours
will
be
very
ungrateful
if
he
is
not
too
grateful
i
am
afraid
he
is
already
much
more
so
than
i
could
wish
and
this
poor
young
man
interests
you
from
motives
of
humanity
that
all
ah
humanity
my
poor
queen
that
is
the
very
virtue
that
is
the
ruin
of
all
of
us
women
yes
and
you
understand
as
the
king
the
duc
my
mother
even
my
husband
may
at
any
moment
enter
my
room
you
want
me
to
hide
your
little
huguenot
as
long
as
he
is
ill
on
condition
i
send
him
back
to
you
when
he
is
cured
scoffer
said
marguerite
no
i
do
not
lay
my
plans
so
far
in
advance
but
if
you
could
conceal
the
poor
fellow
if
you
could
preserve
the
life
i
have
saved
i
confess
i
should
be
most
grateful
you
are
free
at
the
hôtel
de
guise
you
have
neither
nor
husband
to
spy
on
you
or
constrain
you
besides
behind
your
room
there
is
a
closet
like
mine
into
which
no
one
is
entitled
to
enter
so
lend
me
your
closet
for
my
huguenot
and
when
he
is
cured
open
the
cage
and
let
the
bird
fly
away
there
is
only
one
difficulty
my
dear
queen
the
cage
is
already
occupied
what
have
also
saved
somebody
that
is
exactly
what
i
answered
your
brother
with
ah
i
understand
that
why
you
spoke
so
low
that
i
could
not
hear
you
listen
marguerite
it
is
an
admirable
story
is
no
less
poetical
and
romantic
than
yours
after
i
had
left
you
six
of
my
guards
i
returned
with
the
rest
to
the
hôtel
de
guise
and
i
was
watching
them
pillage
and
burn
a
house
separated
from
my
brother
palace
only
by
the
rue
des
quatre
fils
when
i
heard
the
voices
of
men
swearing
and
of
women
crying
i
went
out
on
the
balcony
and
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
a
sword
flashing
so
brilliantly
that
it
seemed
to
light
up
the
whole
scene
i
was
filled
with
admiration
for
this
fiery
sword
i
am
fond
of
fine
things
you
know
then
naturally
enough
i
tried
to
distinguish
the
arm
wielding
it
and
then
the
body
to
which
the
arm
belonged
amid
and
shouts
i
at
last
made
out
the
man
and
i
saw
a
hero
an
ajax
telamon
i
heard
a
voice
the
voice
of
a
stentor
my
enthusiasm
awoke
i
stood
there
panting
trembling
at
every
blow
aimed
at
him
at
every
thrust
he
parried
that
was
a
quarter
hour
of
emotion
such
as
i
had
never
before
experienced
my
queen
and
never
believed
was
possible
to
experience
so
there
i
was
panting
holding
my
breath
trembling
and
voiceless
when
all
of
a
sudden
my
hero
disappeared
how
struck
down
by
a
stone
an
old
woman
threw
at
him
then
like
cyrus
i
found
my
voice
and
screamed
help
my
guards
went
out
lifted
him
up
and
bore
him
to
the
room
which
you
want
for
your
alas
my
dear
henriette
i
can
better
understand
this
story
because
it
is
so
nearly
my
own
with
this
difference
queen
that
as
i
am
serving
my
king
and
my
religion
i
have
no
reason
to
send
monsieur
annibal
de
coconnas
away
his
name
is
annibal
de
coconnas
said
marguerite
laughing
a
terrible
name
is
it
not
well
he
who
bears
it
is
worthy
of
it
what
a
champion
he
is
by
heaven
and
how
he
made
the
blood
flow
put
on
your
mask
my
queen
for
we
are
now
at
the
palace
why
put
on
my
mask
because
i
wish
to
show
you
my
hero
is
he
handsome
he
seemed
magnificent
to
me
during
the
conflict
to
be
sure
it
was
at
night
and
he
was
lighted
up
by
the
flames
this
morning
by
daylight
i
confess
he
seemed
to
me
to
have
lost
a
little
so
then
my
is
rejected
at
the
hôtel
de
guise
i
am
sorry
for
it
for
that
is
the
last
place
where
they
would
look
for
a
huguenot
oh
no
your
huguenot
shall
come
i
will
have
him
brought
this
evening
one
shall
sleep
in
the
corner
of
the
closet
and
the
other
in
the
left
but
when
they
recognize
each
other
as
protestant
and
catholic
they
will
fight
oh
there
is
no
danger
monsieur
de
coconnas
has
had
a
cut
down
the
face
that
prevents
him
from
seeing
very
well
your
huguenot
is
wounded
in
the
chest
so
that
he
ca
move
and
besides
you
have
only
to
tell
him
to
be
silent
on
the
subject
of
religion
and
all
will
go
well
so
be
it
it
a
bargain
and
now
let
us
go
in
thanks
said
marguerite
pressing
her
friend
hand
here
madame
said
the
duchess
you
are
again
majesty
suffer
me
then
to
do
the
honors
of
the
hôtel
de
guise
fittingly
for
the
queen
of
navarre
and
the
duchess
alighting
from
the
litter
almost
knelt
on
the
ground
in
helping
marguerite
to
step
down
then
pointing
to
the
palace
door
guarded
by
two
sentinels
arquebuse
in
hand
she
followed
the
queen
at
a
respectful
distance
and
this
humble
attitude
she
maintained
as
long
as
she
was
in
sight
as
soon
as
she
reached
her
room
the
duchess
closed
the
door
and
calling
to
her
a
thorough
sicilian
said
to
her
in
italian
mica
how
is
monsieur
le
comte
better
and
better
replied
she
what
is
he
doing
at
this
moment
madame
he
is
taking
some
refreshment
it
is
always
a
good
sign
said
marguerite
when
the
appetite
returns
ah
that
is
true
i
forgot
you
were
a
pupil
of
ambroise
paré
leave
us
mica
why
do
you
send
her
away
that
she
may
be
on
the
watch
mica
left
the
room
now
said
the
duchess
will
you
go
in
to
see
him
or
shall
i
send
for
him
here
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
i
wish
to
see
him
without
his
seeing
me
what
matters
it
you
have
your
mask
he
may
recognize
me
by
my
hair
my
hands
a
jewel
how
cautious
she
is
since
she
has
been
married
my
pretty
queen
marguerite
smiled
well
continued
the
duchess
i
see
only
one
way
what
is
that
to
look
through
the
keyhole
very
well
take
me
to
the
door
the
duchess
took
marguerite
by
the
hand
and
led
her
to
a
door
covered
with
tapestry
then
bending
one
knee
she
applied
her
eye
to
the
keyhole
is
all
right
he
is
sitting
at
table
with
his
face
turned
toward
us
come
the
queen
took
her
friend
place
and
looked
through
the
keyhole
coconnas
as
the
duchess
had
said
was
sitting
at
a
table
and
despite
his
wounds
was
doing
ample
justice
to
the
good
things
before
him
ah
great
heavens
cried
marguerite
starting
back
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
duchess
in
amazement
impossible
no
yes
on
my
soul
is
the
very
man
who
hush
said
marguerite
getting
to
her
feet
and
seizing
the
hand
is
the
man
who
pursued
my
huguenot
into
my
room
and
stabbed
him
in
my
arms
oh
henriette
how
fortunate
he
did
not
see
me
well
then
you
have
seen
him
fighting
was
he
not
handsome
i
do
not
know
said
marguerite
for
i
was
looking
at
the
man
he
was
pursuing
what
is
his
name
you
will
not
mention
it
before
the
count
no
i
give
you
my
promise
lerac
de
la
mole
and
what
do
you
think
of
him
now
of
monsieur
de
la
mole
no
of
monsieur
de
coconnas
faith
said
marguerite
i
confess
i
think
she
stopped
come
come
said
the
duchess
i
see
you
are
angry
with
him
for
having
wounded
your
huguenot
why
so
far
said
marguerite
laughing
my
huguenot
owes
him
nothing
the
slash
he
gave
him
under
his
eye
they
are
quits
then
and
we
can
reconcile
them
send
me
your
wounded
man
not
now
by
and
by
when
when
you
have
found
yours
another
room
which
marguerite
looked
meaningly
at
her
friend
who
after
a
silence
laughed
so
be
it
said
the
duchess
alliance
firmer
than
ever
friendship
ever
sincere
and
the
word
in
case
we
need
each
other
the
triple
name
of
your
triple
god
cupido
and
the
two
princesses
separated
after
one
more
kiss
and
pressing
each
other
hand
for
the
twentieth
time
chapter
xiii
how
there
are
keys
which
open
doors
they
are
not
meant
for
the
queen
of
navarre
on
her
return
to
the
louvre
found
gillonne
in
great
excitement
madame
de
sauve
had
been
there
in
her
absence
she
had
brought
a
key
sent
her
by
the
queen
mother
it
was
the
key
of
the
room
in
which
henry
was
confined
it
was
evident
that
the
queen
mother
for
some
purpose
of
her
own
wished
the
béarnais
to
spend
that
night
in
madame
de
sauve
apartment
marguerite
took
the
key
and
turned
it
over
and
over
she
made
gillonne
repeat
madame
de
sauve
every
word
weighed
them
letter
by
letter
in
her
mind
and
at
length
thought
she
detected
catharine
plan
she
took
pen
and
ink
and
wrote
of
going
to
madame
de
sauve
come
to
the
queen
of
she
rolled
up
the
paper
put
it
in
the
hollow
of
the
key
and
ordered
gillonne
to
slip
the
key
under
the
king
door
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
this
first
duty
having
been
attended
to
marguerite
thought
of
the
wounded
man
closed
all
the
doors
entered
the
closet
and
to
her
great
surprise
found
la
mole
dressed
in
all
his
clothes
torn
and
as
they
were
on
seeing
her
he
strove
to
rise
but
still
dizzy
could
not
stand
and
fell
back
upon
the
sofa
which
had
served
for
his
bed
what
is
the
matter
sir
asked
marguerite
and
why
do
you
thus
disobey
your
physician
orders
i
recommended
you
rest
and
instead
of
following
my
advice
you
do
just
the
contrary
oh
madame
said
gillonne
it
is
not
my
fault
i
have
entreated
monsieur
le
comte
not
to
commit
this
folly
but
he
declares
that
nothing
shall
keep
him
any
longer
at
the
louvre
leave
the
louvre
said
marguerite
gazing
with
astonishment
at
the
young
man
who
cast
down
his
eyes
why
it
is
impossible
you
can
not
walk
you
are
pale
and
weak
your
knees
tremble
only
a
few
hours
ago
the
wound
in
your
shoulder
was
still
bleeding
madame
said
the
young
man
as
earnestly
as
i
thanked
your
majesty
for
having
given
me
shelter
as
earnestly
do
i
pray
you
now
to
suffer
me
to
depart
i
scarcely
know
what
to
call
such
a
resolution
said
marguerite
it
is
worse
than
ingratitude
oh
cried
la
mole
clasping
his
hands
think
me
not
ungrateful
my
gratitude
will
cease
only
with
my
life
it
will
not
last
long
then
said
marguerite
moved
at
these
words
the
sincerity
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
for
your
wounds
will
open
and
you
will
die
from
loss
of
blood
or
you
will
be
recognized
for
a
huguenot
and
killed
ere
you
have
gone
fifty
yards
in
the
street
nevertheless
i
must
leave
the
louvre
murmured
la
mole
must
returned
marguerite
fixing
her
serene
inscrutable
eyes
upon
him
then
turning
rather
pale
she
added
ah
yes
forgive
me
sir
i
understand
doubtless
there
is
some
one
outside
the
louvre
who
is
anxiously
waiting
for
you
you
are
right
monsieur
de
la
mole
it
is
natural
and
i
understand
it
why
did
you
say
so
at
first
or
rather
why
did
i
think
of
it
myself
it
is
duty
in
the
exercise
of
hospitality
to
protect
one
guest
affections
as
well
as
to
cure
his
wounds
and
to
care
for
the
spirit
just
as
one
cares
for
the
body
alas
madame
said
la
mole
you
are
laboring
under
a
strange
mistake
i
am
well
nigh
alone
in
the
world
and
altogether
so
in
paris
where
no
one
knows
me
my
assassin
is
the
first
man
i
have
spoken
to
in
this
city
your
majesty
the
first
woman
who
has
spoken
to
me
then
said
marguerite
why
would
you
go
because
replied
la
mole
last
night
you
got
no
rest
and
marguerite
blushed
gillonne
said
she
it
is
already
evening
and
time
to
deliver
that
key
gillonne
smiled
and
left
the
room
but
continued
marguerite
if
you
are
alone
in
paris
without
friends
what
will
you
do
madame
i
soon
shall
have
friends
enough
for
while
i
was
pursued
i
thought
of
my
mother
who
was
a
catholic
methought
i
saw
her
with
a
cross
in
her
hand
gliding
before
me
toward
the
louvre
and
i
vowed
that
if
god
should
save
my
life
i
would
embrace
my
mother
religion
madame
god
did
more
than
save
my
life
he
sent
me
one
of
his
angels
to
make
me
love
life
but
you
can
not
walk
before
you
have
gone
a
hundred
steps
you
will
faint
away
madame
i
have
made
the
experiment
in
the
closet
i
walk
slowly
and
painfully
it
is
true
but
let
me
get
as
far
as
the
place
du
louvre
once
outside
let
befall
what
will
marguerite
leaned
her
head
on
her
hand
and
sank
into
deep
thought
and
the
king
of
navarre
said
she
significantly
you
no
longer
speak
of
him
in
changing
your
religion
have
you
also
changed
your
desire
to
enter
his
service
madame
replied
la
mole
growing
pale
you
have
just
hit
upon
the
actual
reason
of
my
departure
i
know
that
the
king
of
navarre
is
exposed
to
the
greatest
danger
and
that
all
your
majesty
influence
as
a
daughter
of
france
will
barely
suffice
to
save
his
life
what
do
you
mean
sir
exclaimed
marguerite
and
what
danger
do
you
refer
to
madame
replied
la
mole
with
some
hesitation
one
can
hear
everything
from
the
closet
where
i
am
is
true
said
marguerite
to
herself
monsieur
de
guise
told
me
so
before
well
added
she
aloud
what
did
you
hear
in
the
first
place
the
conversation
between
your
majesty
and
your
brother
with
françois
said
marguerite
changing
color
yes
madame
with
the
duc
and
then
after
you
went
out
i
heard
what
gillonne
and
madame
de
sauve
said
and
these
two
conversations
yes
madame
married
scarcely
a
week
you
love
your
husband
your
husband
will
come
in
his
turn
in
the
same
way
that
the
duc
and
madame
de
sauve
came
he
will
confide
his
secrets
to
you
well
then
i
must
not
overhear
them
i
should
be
indiscreet
i
can
not
i
must
not
i
will
not
be
by
the
tone
in
which
la
mole
uttered
these
last
words
by
the
anxiety
expressed
in
his
voice
by
the
embarrassment
shown
in
his
eyes
marguerite
was
enlightened
as
by
a
sudden
revelation
aha
said
she
so
you
have
heard
everything
that
has
been
said
in
this
room
yes
madame
these
words
were
uttered
in
a
sigh
and
you
wish
to
depart
this
evening
to
avoid
hearing
any
more
this
moment
if
it
please
your
majesty
to
allow
me
to
go
poor
fellow
said
marguerite
with
a
strange
accent
of
tender
pity
astonished
by
such
a
gentle
reply
when
he
was
expecting
a
rather
forcible
outburst
la
mole
timidly
raised
his
head
his
eyes
met
marguerite
and
were
riveted
as
by
a
magnetic
power
on
their
clear
and
limpid
depths
so
then
you
feel
you
can
not
keep
a
secret
monsieur
de
la
mole
said
marguerite
in
a
soft
voice
as
she
stood
leaning
on
the
back
of
her
chair
half
hidden
in
the
shadow
of
a
thick
tapestry
and
enjoying
the
felicity
of
easily
reading
his
frank
and
open
soul
while
remaining
impenetrable
herself
madame
said
la
mole
i
have
a
miserable
disposition
i
distrust
myself
and
the
happiness
of
another
gives
me
pain
whose
happiness
asked
marguerite
smiling
ah
yes
the
king
of
navarre
poor
henry
you
see
cried
la
mole
passionately
he
is
happy
happy
yes
for
your
majesty
is
sorry
for
him
marguerite
crumpled
up
the
silk
of
her
purse
and
smoothed
out
the
golden
fringe
so
then
you
decline
to
see
the
king
of
navarre
said
she
you
have
made
up
your
mind
you
are
decided
i
fear
i
should
be
troublesome
to
his
majesty
just
at
the
present
time
but
the
duc
my
brother
oh
no
madame
cried
la
mole
the
duc
even
still
less
than
the
king
of
navarre
why
so
asked
marguerite
so
stirred
that
her
voice
trembled
as
she
spoke
because
although
i
am
already
too
bad
a
huguenot
to
be
a
faithful
servant
of
the
king
of
navarre
i
am
not
a
sufficiently
good
catholic
to
be
friends
with
the
duc
and
monsieur
de
guise
this
time
marguerite
cast
down
her
eyes
for
she
felt
the
very
depths
of
her
heart
stirred
by
what
he
said
and
yet
she
could
not
have
told
whether
his
reply
was
meant
to
give
her
joy
or
pain
at
this
moment
gillonne
came
back
marguerite
asked
her
a
question
with
a
glance
gillonne
answer
also
conveyed
by
her
eyes
was
in
the
affirmative
she
had
succeeded
in
getting
the
key
to
the
king
of
navarre
marguerite
turned
her
eyes
toward
la
mole
who
stood
before
her
his
head
drooping
on
his
breast
pale
like
one
suffering
alike
in
mind
and
in
body
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
proud
said
she
and
i
hesitate
to
make
him
a
proposition
he
will
doubtless
reject
la
mole
rose
took
one
step
toward
marguerite
and
was
about
to
bow
low
before
her
to
signify
that
he
was
at
her
service
but
an
intense
keen
burning
pang
forced
the
tears
from
his
eyes
and
conscious
that
he
was
in
danger
of
falling
he
clutched
a
piece
of
tapestry
and
clung
to
it
do
you
see
sir
cried
marguerite
springing
to
him
and
supporting
him
in
her
arms
do
you
see
that
you
still
need
me
a
scarcely
perceptible
movement
passed
over
la
mole
lips
oh
yes
he
whispered
like
the
air
i
breathe
like
the
light
i
see
at
this
moment
three
knocks
were
heard
at
marguerite
door
do
you
hear
madame
cried
gillonne
alarmed
already
exclaimed
marguerite
shall
i
open
wait
perhaps
it
is
the
king
of
navarre
oh
madame
cried
la
mole
recalled
to
himself
by
these
words
which
the
queen
had
spoken
in
such
a
low
tone
that
she
hoped
gillonne
only
had
heard
them
on
my
knees
i
entreat
you
let
me
depart
yes
dead
or
alive
madame
have
pity
on
me
oh
you
do
not
answer
i
will
tell
you
all
and
then
you
will
drive
me
away
i
hope
be
silent
said
marguerite
who
found
an
indescribable
charm
in
the
young
man
reproaches
be
silent
madame
replied
la
mole
who
did
not
find
that
anger
he
expected
in
the
voice
of
the
queen
madame
i
tell
you
again
everything
is
audible
in
this
closet
oh
do
not
make
me
perish
by
tortures
more
cruel
than
the
executioner
could
inflict
silence
silence
said
marguerite
oh
madame
you
are
merciless
you
will
not
hear
me
you
will
not
understand
me
know
then
that
i
love
you
silence
i
tell
you
interrupted
marguerite
placing
on
his
mouth
her
warm
perfumed
hand
which
he
seized
between
both
of
his
and
pressed
eagerly
to
his
lips
but
he
whispered
be
silent
child
who
is
this
rebel
that
refuses
to
obey
his
queen
then
darting
out
of
the
closet
she
shut
the
door
and
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
pressing
her
trembling
hand
to
her
heart
as
if
to
control
it
open
gillonne
gillonne
left
the
room
and
an
instant
after
the
fine
intellectual
but
rather
anxious
countenance
of
the
king
of
navarre
appeared
behind
the
tapestry
you
have
sent
for
me
madame
yes
sire
your
majesty
received
my
letter
and
not
without
some
surprise
i
confess
said
henry
looking
round
with
distrust
which
however
almost
instantly
vanished
from
his
mind
and
not
without
some
apprehension
added
marguerite
i
confess
it
madame
but
still
surrounded
as
i
am
by
deadly
enemies
by
friends
still
more
dangerous
perhaps
than
my
open
foes
i
recollected
that
one
evening
i
had
seen
a
noble
generosity
shining
in
your
eyes
was
the
night
of
our
marriage
that
one
other
evening
i
had
seen
the
star
of
courage
beaming
in
them
was
yesterday
the
day
fixed
for
my
death
well
sire
said
marguerite
smiling
while
henry
seemed
striving
to
read
her
heart
well
madame
returned
the
king
thinking
of
these
things
i
said
to
myself
as
i
read
your
letter
bidding
me
come
friends
for
he
is
a
disarmed
prisoner
the
king
of
navarre
has
but
one
means
of
dying
nobly
of
dying
a
death
that
will
be
recorded
in
history
it
is
to
die
betrayed
by
his
wife
and
i
am
come
sire
replied
marguerite
you
will
change
your
tone
when
you
learn
that
all
this
is
the
work
of
a
woman
who
loves
you
and
whom
you
love
henry
started
back
at
these
words
and
his
keen
gray
eyes
under
their
black
lashes
were
fixed
on
the
queen
with
curiosity
oh
reassure
yourself
sire
said
the
queen
smiling
i
am
not
that
person
but
madame
said
henry
you
sent
me
this
key
and
this
is
your
writing
it
is
my
writing
i
confess
the
letter
came
from
me
but
the
key
is
a
different
matter
let
it
satisfy
you
to
know
that
it
has
passed
through
the
hands
of
four
women
before
it
reached
you
of
four
women
exclaimed
henry
in
astonishment
yes
said
marguerite
queen
catharine
madame
de
sauve
gillonne
and
mine
henry
pondered
over
this
enigma
now
let
us
talk
reasonably
sire
said
marguerite
and
above
all
let
us
speak
frankly
common
report
has
it
that
your
majesty
has
consented
to
abjure
is
it
true
that
report
is
mistaken
i
have
not
yet
consented
but
your
mind
is
made
up
that
is
to
say
i
am
deliberating
when
one
is
twenty
and
almost
a
king
saint
there
are
many
things
well
worth
a
mass
and
among
other
things
life
for
instance
henry
could
not
repress
a
fleeting
smile
you
do
not
tell
me
your
whole
thought
said
marguerite
i
have
reservations
for
my
allies
madame
and
you
know
we
are
but
allies
as
yet
if
indeed
you
were
both
my
ally
and
and
your
wife
sire
faith
yes
and
my
wife
what
then
why
then
it
might
be
different
and
i
perhaps
might
resolve
to
remain
king
of
the
huguenots
as
they
call
me
but
as
it
is
i
must
be
content
to
live
marguerite
looked
at
henry
in
such
a
peculiar
manner
that
it
would
have
awakened
suspicion
in
a
less
acute
mind
than
his
and
are
you
quite
sure
of
succeeding
even
in
that
she
asked
why
almost
but
you
know
in
this
world
nothing
is
certain
it
is
true
replied
marguerite
your
majesty
shows
such
moderation
and
professes
such
disinterestedness
that
after
having
renounced
your
crown
after
having
renounced
your
religion
you
will
probably
renounce
your
alliance
with
a
daughter
of
france
at
least
this
is
hoped
for
these
words
bore
a
significance
which
sent
a
thrill
through
whole
frame
but
instantaneously
repressing
the
emotion
he
said
deign
to
recollect
madame
that
at
this
moment
i
am
not
my
own
master
i
shall
therefore
do
what
the
king
of
france
orders
me
if
i
were
consulted
the
least
in
the
world
on
this
question
affecting
as
it
does
my
throne
my
honor
and
my
life
rather
than
build
my
future
on
this
forced
marriage
of
ours
i
should
prefer
to
enter
a
monastery
or
turn
gamekeeper
this
calm
resignation
this
renunciation
of
the
world
alarmed
marguerite
she
thought
perhaps
this
rupture
of
the
marriage
had
been
agreed
upon
by
charles
catharine
and
the
king
of
navarre
why
should
she
not
be
taken
as
a
dupe
or
a
victim
because
she
was
sister
of
the
one
and
daughter
of
the
other
experience
had
taught
her
that
this
relationship
gave
her
no
ground
on
which
to
build
her
security
so
ambition
was
gnawing
at
this
young
woman
or
rather
this
young
queen
heart
and
she
was
too
far
above
vulgar
frailties
to
be
drawn
into
any
selfish
meanness
in
the
case
of
every
woman
however
mediocre
she
may
be
when
she
loves
her
love
has
none
of
these
petty
trials
for
true
love
is
also
an
ambition
your
majesty
said
marguerite
with
a
sort
of
mocking
disdain
has
no
confidence
in
the
star
that
shines
over
the
head
of
every
king
ah
said
henry
i
vainly
look
for
mine
now
i
can
not
see
it
is
hidden
by
the
storm
which
now
threatens
me
and
suppose
a
woman
breath
were
to
dispel
this
tempest
and
make
the
star
reappear
brilliant
as
ever
difficult
do
you
deny
the
existence
of
this
woman
no
i
deny
her
power
you
mean
her
will
i
said
her
power
and
i
repeat
her
power
a
woman
is
powerful
only
when
love
and
interest
are
combined
within
her
in
equal
degrees
if
either
sentiment
predominates
she
is
like
achilles
vulnerable
now
as
to
this
woman
if
i
mistake
not
i
can
not
rely
on
her
love
marguerite
made
no
reply
listen
said
henry
at
the
last
stroke
of
the
bell
of
saint
germain
you
must
have
thought
of
regaining
your
liberty
sacrificed
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
my
followers
my
concern
was
to
save
my
life
that
was
the
most
essential
thing
we
lose
navarre
indeed
but
what
is
that
compared
with
your
being
enabled
to
speak
aloud
in
your
room
which
you
dared
not
do
when
you
had
some
one
listening
to
you
in
yonder
closet
deeply
absorbed
as
she
was
in
her
thoughts
marguerite
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
the
king
rose
and
prepared
to
seek
his
own
apartment
for
it
was
some
time
after
eleven
and
every
one
at
the
louvre
was
or
seemed
to
be
asleep
henry
took
three
steps
toward
the
door
then
suddenly
stopped
as
if
for
the
first
time
recollecting
the
motive
of
his
visit
to
the
queen
by
the
way
madame
said
he
had
you
not
something
to
communicate
to
me
or
did
you
desire
to
give
me
an
opportunity
of
thanking
you
for
the
reprieve
which
your
brave
presence
in
the
king
armory
brought
me
in
truth
it
was
just
in
time
madame
i
can
not
deny
it
you
appeared
like
a
goddess
of
antiquity
in
the
nick
of
time
to
save
my
life
unfortunate
man
cried
marguerite
in
a
muffled
voice
and
seizing
her
husband
arm
do
you
not
see
that
nothing
is
saved
neither
your
liberty
your
crown
nor
your
life
infatuated
madman
poor
madman
did
you
then
see
nothing
in
my
letter
but
a
rendezvous
did
you
believe
that
marguerite
indignant
at
your
coldness
desired
reparation
i
confess
madame
said
henry
in
astonishment
i
confess
marguerite
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
an
expression
impossible
to
describe
at
this
instant
a
strange
sound
was
heard
like
a
sharp
insistent
scratching
at
the
secret
door
marguerite
led
the
king
toward
the
little
door
listen
said
she
the
queen
mother
is
leaving
her
room
said
a
trembling
voice
outside
which
henry
instantly
recognized
as
madame
de
sauve
where
is
she
going
asked
marguerite
she
is
coming
to
your
majesty
and
then
the
rustling
of
a
silk
gown
growing
fainter
showed
that
madame
de
sauve
was
hastening
rapidly
away
oho
exclaimed
henry
i
was
sure
of
this
said
marguerite
and
i
replied
henry
feared
it
and
this
is
the
proof
of
it
and
half
opening
his
black
velvet
doublet
he
showed
the
queen
that
he
had
beneath
it
a
shirt
of
mail
and
a
long
milan
poniard
which
instantly
glittered
in
his
hand
like
a
viper
in
the
sun
as
if
you
needed
weapon
and
cuirass
here
cried
marguerite
quick
quick
sire
conceal
that
dagger
is
the
queen
mother
indeed
but
the
queen
mother
only
yet
silence
i
hear
her
and
putting
her
mouth
close
to
henry
ear
she
whispered
something
which
the
young
king
heard
with
attention
mingled
with
astonishment
then
he
hid
himself
behind
the
curtains
of
the
bed
meantime
with
the
quickness
of
a
panther
marguerite
sprang
to
the
closet
where
la
mole
was
waiting
in
a
fever
of
excitement
opened
the
door
found
the
young
man
and
pressing
his
hand
in
the
darkness
silence
said
she
approaching
her
lips
so
near
that
he
felt
her
warm
and
balmy
breath
silence
then
returning
to
her
chamber
she
tore
off
her
cut
the
laces
of
her
dress
with
her
poniard
and
sprang
into
bed
it
was
time
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
catharine
had
a
key
for
every
door
in
the
louvre
who
is
there
cried
marguerite
as
catharine
placed
on
guard
at
the
door
the
four
gentlemen
by
whom
she
was
attended
and
as
if
frightened
by
this
sudden
intrusion
into
her
chamber
marguerite
sprang
out
from
behind
the
curtains
of
her
bed
in
a
white
and
then
recognizing
catharine
came
to
kiss
her
hand
with
such
surprise
that
the
wily
florentine
herself
could
not
help
being
deceived
by
it
chapter
xiv
the
second
marriage
night
the
queen
mother
cast
a
marvellously
rapid
glance
around
her
the
velvet
slippers
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
marguerite
clothes
scattered
over
the
chairs
the
way
she
rubbed
her
eyes
as
if
to
drive
away
her
sleepiness
all
convinced
catharine
that
she
had
awakened
her
daughter
then
she
smiled
as
a
woman
does
when
she
has
succeeded
in
her
plans
and
drawing
up
an
easy
chair
she
said
let
us
sit
down
marguerite
and
talk
madame
i
am
listening
it
is
time
said
catharine
slowly
shutting
her
eyes
in
the
characteristic
way
of
people
who
weigh
each
word
or
who
deeply
dissimulate
it
is
time
my
daughter
that
you
should
know
how
ardently
your
brother
and
myself
desire
to
see
you
happy
this
exordium
for
one
who
knew
catharine
was
alarming
what
can
she
be
about
to
say
thought
marguerite
to
be
sure
continued
la
florentine
in
giving
you
in
marriage
we
fulfilled
one
of
those
acts
of
policy
frequently
required
by
important
interests
of
those
who
govern
but
i
must
confess
my
poor
child
that
we
had
no
expectation
that
the
indifference
manifested
by
the
king
of
navarre
for
one
so
young
so
lovely
and
so
fascinating
as
yourself
would
be
so
obstinate
marguerite
arose
and
folding
her
robe
de
chambre
around
her
courtesied
with
ceremonious
respect
to
her
mother
i
have
heard
only
continued
catharine
otherwise
i
should
have
paid
you
an
earlier
visit
that
your
husband
is
far
from
showing
you
those
attentions
you
have
a
right
to
claim
not
merely
as
a
beautiful
woman
but
as
a
princess
of
france
marguerite
sighed
and
catharine
encouraged
by
this
mute
approval
proceeded
in
fact
that
the
king
of
navarre
is
openly
cohabiting
one
of
my
maids
of
honor
who
is
scandalously
smitten
with
him
that
he
scorns
the
love
of
the
woman
graciously
given
to
him
is
an
insult
to
which
we
poor
powerful
ones
of
the
earth
can
not
apply
a
remedy
and
yet
the
meanest
gentleman
in
our
kingdom
would
avenge
it
by
calling
out
his
or
having
his
son
do
so
marguerite
dropped
her
head
for
some
time
my
daughter
catharine
went
on
to
say
i
have
seen
by
your
reddened
eyes
by
your
bitter
sallies
against
la
sauve
that
in
spite
of
your
efforts
your
heart
must
show
external
signs
of
its
bleeding
wound
marguerite
trembled
a
slight
movement
had
shaken
the
curtains
but
fortunately
catharine
did
not
notice
it
this
wound
said
she
with
affectionate
sweetness
redoubled
this
wound
my
daughter
a
mother
hand
must
cure
those
who
with
the
intention
of
securing
your
happiness
have
brought
about
your
marriage
and
who
in
their
anxiety
about
you
notice
that
every
night
henry
of
navarre
goes
to
the
wrong
rooms
those
who
can
not
allow
a
kinglet
like
him
to
insult
a
woman
of
such
beauty
of
such
high
rank
and
so
worthy
by
scorning
your
person
and
neglecting
his
chances
of
posterity
those
who
see
that
at
the
first
favorable
wind
this
wild
and
insolent
madcap
will
turn
against
our
family
and
expel
you
from
his
house
i
say
have
not
they
the
right
to
secure
your
interests
by
entirely
dividing
them
from
his
so
that
your
future
may
be
better
suited
to
yourself
and
your
rank
and
yet
madame
replied
marguerite
in
spite
of
these
observations
so
replete
with
maternal
love
and
filling
me
with
joy
and
pride
i
am
bold
enough
to
affirm
to
your
majesty
that
the
king
of
navarre
is
my
husband
catharine
started
with
rage
and
drawing
closer
to
marguerite
she
said
he
your
husband
is
it
sufficient
to
make
you
husband
and
wife
that
the
church
has
pronounced
its
blessing
upon
you
and
is
the
marriage
consecration
only
in
the
words
of
the
priest
he
your
husband
ah
my
daughter
if
you
were
madame
de
sauve
you
might
give
me
this
reply
but
wholly
contrary
of
what
we
expected
of
him
since
you
granted
henry
of
navarre
the
honor
of
calling
you
his
wife
he
has
given
all
your
rights
to
another
woman
and
at
this
very
instant
even
said
catharine
raising
her
voice
this
key
opens
the
door
of
madame
de
apartment
come
with
me
and
you
will
see
oh
not
so
loud
madame
not
so
loud
i
beseech
you
said
marguerite
for
not
only
are
you
mistaken
but
well
well
you
will
awaken
my
husband
as
she
said
these
words
marguerite
arose
with
a
perfectly
voluptuous
grace
her
white
dress
fluttering
loosely
around
her
while
the
large
open
sleeves
displayed
her
bare
and
faultlessly
modelled
arm
and
truly
royal
hand
and
taking
a
taper
she
held
it
near
the
bed
and
drawing
back
the
curtain
and
smiling
significantly
at
her
mother
pointed
to
the
haughty
profile
the
black
locks
and
the
parted
lips
of
the
king
of
navarre
who
as
he
lay
upon
the
disordered
bed
seemed
buried
in
profound
repose
pale
with
haggard
eyes
her
body
thrown
back
as
if
an
abyss
had
opened
at
her
feet
catharine
uttered
not
a
cry
but
a
hoarse
bellow
you
see
madame
said
marguerite
you
were
misinformed
catharine
looked
first
at
marguerite
then
at
henry
in
her
active
mind
she
combined
marguerite
smile
with
the
picture
of
that
pale
and
dewy
brow
those
eyes
circled
by
rings
and
she
bit
her
thin
lips
in
silent
fury
marguerite
allowed
her
mother
for
a
moment
to
contemplate
this
picture
which
affected
her
like
the
head
of
medusa
then
she
dropped
the
curtain
and
stepping
on
her
she
came
back
to
catharine
and
sat
down
you
were
saying
madame
the
florentine
for
several
seconds
tried
to
fathom
the
young
naïveté
but
as
if
her
keen
glance
had
become
blunted
on
calmness
she
exclaimed
nothing
and
hastily
left
the
room
as
soon
as
the
sound
of
her
departing
footsteps
had
died
away
down
the
long
corridor
the
opened
a
second
time
and
henry
with
sparkling
eyes
trembling
hand
and
panting
breath
came
out
and
knelt
at
marguerite
feet
he
was
dressed
only
in
his
and
his
coat
of
mail
so
that
marguerite
seeing
him
in
such
an
odd
rig
could
not
help
laughing
even
while
she
was
warmly
shaking
hands
with
him
ah
madame
ah
marguerite
he
cried
how
shall
i
ever
repay
you
and
he
covered
her
hand
with
kisses
which
gradually
strayed
higher
up
along
her
arm
sire
said
she
gently
retreating
can
you
forget
that
a
poor
woman
to
whom
you
owe
your
life
is
mourning
and
suffering
on
your
account
madame
de
sauve
added
she
in
a
lower
tone
has
forgotten
her
jealousy
in
sending
you
to
me
and
to
that
sacrifice
she
may
probably
have
to
add
her
life
for
you
know
better
than
any
one
how
terrible
is
my
mother
anger
henry
shuddered
and
rising
started
to
leave
the
room
upon
second
thoughts
said
marguerite
with
admirable
coquetry
i
have
thought
it
all
over
and
i
see
no
cause
for
alarm
the
key
was
given
to
you
without
any
directions
and
it
will
be
supposed
that
you
granted
me
the
preference
for
and
so
i
do
marguerite
consent
but
to
forget
not
so
loud
sire
not
so
loud
replied
the
queen
employing
the
same
words
she
had
a
few
minutes
before
used
to
her
mother
any
one
in
the
adjoining
closet
can
hear
you
and
as
i
am
not
yet
quite
free
i
will
ask
you
to
speak
in
a
lower
tone
oho
said
henry
half
smiling
half
gloomily
that
true
i
was
forgetting
that
i
am
probably
not
the
one
destined
to
play
the
end
of
this
interesting
scene
this
closet
let
me
beg
of
your
majesty
to
enter
there
said
marguerite
for
i
am
desirous
of
having
the
honor
of
presenting
to
you
a
worthy
gentleman
wounded
during
the
massacre
while
making
his
way
to
the
louvre
to
apprise
your
majesty
of
the
danger
with
which
you
were
threatened
the
queen
went
toward
the
door
and
henry
followed
her
she
opened
it
and
the
king
was
thunderstruck
at
beholding
a
man
in
this
cabinet
fated
to
reveal
such
continued
surprises
but
la
mole
was
still
more
surprised
at
thus
unexpectedly
finding
himself
in
the
presence
of
henry
of
navarre
the
result
was
that
the
king
cast
an
ironical
glance
on
marguerite
who
bore
it
without
flinching
sire
said
she
i
am
in
dread
lest
this
gentleman
may
be
murdered
even
here
in
my
very
chamber
he
is
devoted
to
your
majesty
service
and
for
that
reason
i
commend
him
to
your
royal
protection
sire
continued
the
young
man
i
am
the
comte
lerac
de
la
mole
whom
your
majesty
was
expecting
i
was
recommended
to
you
by
that
poor
monsieur
de
téligny
who
was
killed
by
my
side
aha
replied
henry
you
are
right
sir
the
queen
gave
me
his
letter
but
have
you
not
also
a
letter
from
the
governor
of
languedoc
yes
sire
and
i
was
recommended
to
deliver
it
to
your
majesty
as
soon
as
i
arrived
why
did
you
not
do
so
sire
i
hastened
to
the
louvre
last
evening
but
your
majesty
was
too
much
occupied
to
give
me
audience
true
answered
the
king
but
i
should
think
you
might
have
sent
the
letter
to
me
i
had
orders
from
monsieur
to
give
it
to
no
one
else
but
your
majesty
since
it
contained
he
said
information
so
important
that
he
feared
to
entrust
it
to
any
ordinary
messenger
the
contents
are
indeed
of
a
serious
nature
said
the
king
when
he
had
received
and
read
the
letter
advising
my
instant
withdrawal
from
the
court
of
france
and
retirement
to
béarn
although
a
catholic
was
always
a
stanch
friend
of
mine
and
it
is
possible
that
acting
as
governor
of
a
province
he
got
scent
of
what
was
in
the
wind
here
saint
monsieur
why
was
not
this
letter
given
to
me
three
days
ago
instead
of
now
because
as
i
before
assured
your
majesty
that
using
all
the
speed
and
diligence
in
my
power
it
was
wholly
impossible
to
arrive
before
yesterday
that
is
very
unfortunate
very
unfortunate
murmured
the
king
we
should
then
have
been
in
security
either
at
rochelle
or
in
some
broad
plain
surrounded
by
two
or
three
thousand
trusty
horsemen
sire
what
is
done
is
done
said
marguerite
in
a
low
voice
and
instead
of
wasting
your
time
complaining
over
the
past
you
must
do
the
best
possible
with
the
future
if
you
were
in
my
place
madame
replied
henry
with
his
questioning
look
you
would
still
have
hope
would
you
certainly
i
should
i
should
consider
myself
as
playing
a
game
of
three
points
of
which
i
had
lost
only
the
first
ah
madame
whispered
henry
if
i
dared
but
hope
that
you
would
go
partners
with
me
in
the
game
if
i
had
intended
to
side
with
your
adversaries
replied
marguerite
i
should
scarcely
have
delayed
so
long
true
replied
henry
and
i
am
ungrateful
and
as
you
say
the
past
may
still
be
repaired
alas
sire
said
la
mole
i
wish
your
majesty
every
kind
of
good
fortune
but
now
the
admiral
is
no
more
over
henry
face
passed
that
sly
smile
which
was
not
understood
at
court
until
after
he
became
king
of
france
but
madame
said
the
king
attentively
observing
la
mole
this
gentleman
can
not
remain
here
without
causing
you
considerable
inconvenience
and
being
himself
subject
to
very
unpleasant
surprises
what
will
you
do
with
him
could
we
not
remove
him
from
the
louvre
asked
marguerite
for
i
entirely
agree
with
you
it
will
be
difficult
then
could
not
monsieur
de
la
mole
find
accommodation
in
your
apartments
alas
madame
you
speak
as
if
i
were
still
king
of
the
huguenots
and
had
subjects
to
command
you
are
aware
that
i
am
half
converted
to
the
catholic
faith
and
have
no
people
at
all
any
one
but
marguerite
would
have
promptly
answered
he
is
a
catholic
but
the
queen
wished
henry
himself
to
ask
her
to
do
the
very
thing
she
was
desirous
of
effecting
while
la
mole
perceiving
his
caution
and
not
knowing
where
to
set
foot
on
the
slippery
ground
of
such
a
dangerous
court
as
that
of
france
remained
perfectly
silent
but
what
is
this
the
governor
says
in
his
letter
said
henry
again
casting
his
eyes
over
the
missive
he
held
in
his
hand
he
states
that
your
mother
was
a
catholic
and
from
that
circumstance
originates
the
interest
he
felt
in
you
and
what
were
you
telling
me
monsieur
le
comte
said
marguerite
respecting
a
vow
you
had
formed
to
change
your
religion
i
confess
my
recollection
on
the
subject
is
somewhat
confused
have
the
goodness
to
assist
me
de
la
mole
did
not
your
conversation
refer
to
something
of
the
nature
the
king
appears
to
desire
alas
madame
what
i
did
say
was
so
coldly
received
by
your
majesty
that
i
did
not
dare
simply
because
it
in
no
way
concerned
me
answered
marguerite
but
explain
yourself
to
the
king
explain
well
what
was
the
vow
asked
the
king
sire
said
la
mole
when
pursued
by
assassins
myself
unarmed
and
almost
expiring
from
my
two
wounds
i
fancied
i
beheld
my
spirit
holding
a
cross
in
her
hands
and
guiding
me
to
the
louvre
then
i
vowed
that
if
my
life
were
preserved
i
would
adopt
the
religion
of
my
mother
who
had
been
permitted
to
leave
her
grave
to
direct
me
to
a
place
of
safety
during
that
horrible
night
heaven
conducted
me
here
sire
i
find
myself
here
under
the
protection
of
a
princess
of
france
and
of
the
king
of
navarre
my
life
was
miraculously
saved
therefore
i
must
fulfil
my
vow
i
am
ready
to
become
a
catholic
henry
frowned
sceptic
that
he
was
he
could
well
understand
a
change
of
religion
from
motives
of
interest
but
he
distrusted
abjuration
through
faith
the
king
does
not
want
to
take
charge
of
my
thought
marguerite
la
mole
still
remained
mute
and
awkward
between
the
two
opposing
wills
he
felt
without
being
able
to
define
why
that
he
was
in
a
ridiculous
position
marguerite
womanly
tact
came
to
his
relief
sire
said
she
we
forget
that
the
poor
wounded
gentleman
has
need
of
repose
i
myself
am
half
asleep
ah
see
la
mole
did
indeed
turn
pale
but
it
was
at
marguerite
last
words
which
he
had
interpreted
according
to
his
own
ideas
well
madame
answered
henry
nothing
can
be
simpler
can
we
not
leave
monsieur
de
la
mole
to
take
his
repose
the
young
man
fixed
a
supplicating
look
on
marguerite
and
in
spite
of
the
presence
of
the
two
majesties
sunk
upon
a
chair
overcome
with
fatigue
and
pain
marguerite
understood
all
the
love
in
his
look
all
the
despair
in
his
weakness
sire
said
she
your
majesty
is
bound
to
confer
on
this
young
man
who
imperilled
his
life
for
his
king
since
he
received
his
wounds
while
coming
hither
to
inform
you
of
the
admiral
death
and
téligny
your
majesty
is
bound
i
repeat
to
confer
on
him
an
honor
for
which
he
will
be
grateful
all
his
life
long
what
is
it
madame
asked
henry
command
me
i
am
ready
monsieur
de
la
mole
must
sleep
at
your
majesty
feet
while
you
sire
can
sleep
on
this
couch
with
the
permission
of
my
august
spouse
added
marguerite
smiling
i
will
summon
gillonne
and
return
to
bed
for
i
assure
you
i
am
not
the
least
wearied
of
us
three
henry
had
shrewd
sense
and
a
quick
perception
of
things
friends
and
enemies
subsequently
found
fault
with
him
for
possessing
too
much
of
both
he
fully
admitted
that
she
who
thus
banished
him
from
the
nuptial
bed
was
well
justified
in
so
doing
by
the
indifference
he
had
himself
manifested
toward
her
and
then
too
she
had
just
repaid
this
indifference
by
saving
his
life
he
therefore
allowed
no
to
dictate
his
answer
madame
said
he
if
monsieur
de
la
mole
were
able
to
come
to
my
quarters
i
would
give
him
my
own
bed
yes
replied
marguerite
but
your
quarters
just
at
the
present
time
would
not
be
safe
for
either
of
you
and
prudence
dictates
that
your
majesty
should
remain
here
until
morning
then
without
awaiting
the
king
reply
she
summoned
gillonne
and
bade
her
prepare
the
necessary
cushions
for
the
king
and
to
arrange
a
bed
at
the
king
feet
for
la
mole
who
appeared
so
happy
and
contented
with
the
honor
that
one
would
have
sworn
he
no
longer
felt
his
wounds
then
marguerite
courtesing
low
to
the
king
passed
into
her
chamber
the
door
of
which
was
well
furnished
with
bolts
and
threw
herself
on
the
bed
one
thing
is
certain
said
marguerite
to
herself
monsieur
de
la
mole
must
have
a
protector
at
the
louvre
and
he
who
sees
and
hears
nothing
may
change
his
mind
then
she
called
gillonne
who
was
waiting
to
receive
her
last
orders
gillonne
came
to
her
gillonne
said
she
in
a
whisper
you
must
contrive
to
bring
my
brother
the
duc
here
morning
before
eight
it
was
just
striking
two
at
the
louvre
la
mole
for
a
few
moments
talked
on
political
subjects
with
the
king
who
gradually
grew
drowsy
and
was
soon
snoring
la
mole
might
have
slept
as
well
as
the
king
but
marguerite
was
not
asleep
she
kept
turning
from
side
to
side
in
her
bed
and
the
noise
she
made
disturbed
the
young
man
ideas
and
sleep
he
is
very
young
murmured
marguerite
in
her
wakeful
mood
he
is
very
timid
perhaps
but
we
must
see
perhaps
it
will
be
ridiculous
yet
he
has
handsome
eyes
and
a
good
figure
and
he
is
very
charming
but
if
he
should
not
turn
out
to
be
brave
he
ran
away
he
is
renouncing
his
faith
it
is
too
bad
the
dream
began
well
however
let
things
take
their
course
and
entrust
them
to
that
madcap
henriette
triple
god
and
toward
daybreak
marguerite
fell
asleep
murmuring
cupido
chapter
xv
what
woman
wills
god
wills
marguerite
was
not
mistaken
the
wrath
distilled
in
the
depths
of
catharine
heart
at
sight
of
this
comedy
the
intrigue
of
which
she
followed
without
being
in
any
way
able
to
change
its
denouement
required
a
victim
so
instead
of
going
directly
to
her
own
room
the
queen
mother
proceeded
to
that
of
her
lady
in
waiting
madame
de
sauve
was
in
expectation
of
two
visits
one
she
hoped
to
receive
from
henry
and
the
other
she
feared
was
in
store
for
her
from
the
queen
mother
as
she
lay
in
her
bed
only
partially
undressed
while
dariole
kept
watch
in
the
antechamber
she
heard
a
key
turn
in
the
lock
and
then
slowly
approaching
footsteps
which
would
have
seemed
heavy
if
they
had
not
been
deadened
by
thick
rugs
she
did
not
recognize
light
eager
step
she
suspected
that
dariole
was
prevented
from
coming
to
warn
her
and
so
leaning
on
her
elbow
she
waited
with
eye
and
ear
alert
the
portière
was
lifted
and
the
trembling
young
woman
saw
catharine
de
médicis
appear
catharine
seemed
calm
but
madame
de
sauve
accustomed
for
two
years
to
study
her
well
knew
what
dark
designs
and
possibly
cruel
vengeance
might
be
concealed
beneath
that
apparent
calm
at
sight
of
catharine
madame
de
sauve
was
about
to
spring
from
her
bed
but
catharine
signed
to
her
to
stay
where
she
was
and
poor
charlotte
was
fixed
to
the
spot
inwardly
endeavoring
to
collect
all
the
forces
of
her
soul
to
endure
the
storm
which
was
silently
gathering
did
you
convey
the
key
to
the
king
of
navarre
inquired
catharine
without
the
tone
of
her
voice
betraying
any
change
and
yet
as
she
spoke
her
lips
grew
paler
and
paler
i
did
madame
answered
charlotte
in
a
voice
which
she
vainly
tried
to
make
as
firm
and
assured
as
catherine
was
and
have
you
seen
him
who
asked
madame
de
sauve
the
king
of
navarre
no
madame
but
i
am
expecting
him
and
when
i
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
i
firmly
believed
it
was
he
at
this
answer
which
indicated
either
perfect
confidence
or
deep
dissimulation
on
madame
de
sauve
part
catharine
could
not
repress
a
slight
shiver
she
clinched
her
short
plump
hand
and
yet
you
knew
perfectly
well
said
she
with
her
evil
smile
you
knew
perfectly
well
carlotta
that
the
king
of
navarre
would
not
come
i
madame
i
knew
that
exclaimed
charlotte
with
a
tone
of
surprise
perfectly
well
assumed
yes
you
knew
it
if
he
does
not
come
he
must
be
dead
replied
the
young
woman
shuddering
at
the
mere
supposition
what
gave
charlotte
the
courage
to
lie
so
was
the
certainty
that
she
would
suffer
from
a
terrible
vengeance
if
her
little
treason
should
be
discovered
but
did
you
not
write
to
the
king
carlotta
mia
inquired
catharine
with
the
same
cruel
and
silent
laugh
no
madame
answered
charlotte
with
naïveté
i
can
not
recollect
receiving
your
majesty
commands
to
do
so
a
short
silence
followed
during
which
catharine
continued
to
gaze
on
madame
de
sauve
as
the
serpent
looks
at
the
bird
it
wishes
to
fascinate
you
think
you
are
pretty
said
catharine
you
think
you
are
clever
do
you
not
no
madame
answered
charlotte
i
only
know
that
sometimes
your
majesty
has
been
graciously
pleased
to
commend
both
my
personal
attractions
and
address
well
then
said
catharine
growing
eager
and
animated
you
were
mistaken
if
you
think
so
and
i
lied
when
i
told
you
so
you
are
a
simpleton
and
hideous
compared
to
my
daughter
margot
oh
madame
replied
charlotte
that
is
a
fact
i
will
not
even
try
to
deny
least
of
all
in
your
presence
so
then
the
king
of
navarre
prefers
my
daughter
to
you
a
circumstance
i
presume
not
to
your
wishes
and
certainly
not
what
we
agreed
should
be
the
case
alas
madame
cried
charlotte
bursting
into
a
torrent
of
tears
which
now
flowed
from
no
feigned
source
if
it
be
so
i
can
but
say
i
am
very
unfortunate
it
is
so
said
catharine
darting
the
keenness
of
her
eyes
like
a
double
poniard
into
madame
de
sauve
heart
but
who
can
make
you
believe
that
asked
charlotte
go
down
to
the
queen
of
navarre
and
you
will
find
your
lover
there
oh
exclaimed
madame
de
sauve
catharine
shrugged
her
shoulders
are
you
jealous
pray
asked
the
queen
mother
i
exclaimed
madame
de
sauve
recalling
her
strength
yes
you
i
should
like
to
see
a
frenchwoman
jealousy
but
said
madame
de
sauve
how
should
your
majesty
expect
me
to
be
jealous
except
out
of
vanity
i
love
the
king
of
navarre
only
as
far
as
your
majesty
service
requires
it
catharine
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
with
dreamy
eyes
what
you
tell
me
may
on
the
whole
be
true
she
murmured
your
majesty
reads
my
heart
and
your
heart
is
wholly
devoted
to
me
command
me
madame
and
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
well
then
carlotta
since
you
are
ready
to
sacrifice
yourself
in
my
service
you
must
still
continue
for
my
sake
to
be
in
love
with
the
king
of
navarre
and
above
all
to
be
very
jealous
jealous
as
an
italian
woman
but
madame
asked
charlotte
how
does
an
italian
woman
show
her
jealousy
i
will
tell
you
replied
catharine
and
after
nodding
her
head
two
or
three
times
she
left
the
room
as
deliberately
and
noiselessly
as
she
had
come
in
charlotte
confused
by
the
keen
look
of
those
eyes
dilated
like
a
or
a
panther
without
thereby
losing
anything
of
their
inscrutability
allowed
her
to
go
without
uttering
a
single
word
without
even
letting
her
breathing
be
heard
and
she
did
not
even
take
a
respiration
until
she
heard
the
door
close
behind
her
and
dariole
came
to
say
that
the
terrible
apparition
had
departed
dariole
said
she
draw
up
an
armchair
close
to
my
bed
and
spend
the
night
in
it
i
beg
you
to
do
so
for
i
should
not
dare
to
stay
alone
dariole
obeyed
but
in
spite
of
the
company
of
her
faithful
attendant
who
stayed
near
her
in
spite
of
the
light
from
the
lamp
which
she
commanded
to
be
left
burning
for
the
sake
of
greater
tranquillity
madame
de
sauve
also
did
not
fall
asleep
till
daylight
so
insistently
rang
in
her
ears
the
metallic
accent
of
catharine
voice
though
marguerite
had
not
fallen
asleep
till
daybreak
she
awoke
at
the
first
blast
of
the
trumpets
at
the
first
barking
of
the
dogs
she
instantly
arose
and
began
to
put
on
a
costume
so
negligent
that
it
could
not
fail
to
attract
attention
then
she
summoned
her
women
and
had
the
gentlemen
ordinarily
in
attendance
on
the
king
of
navarre
shown
into
her
antechamber
and
finally
opening
the
door
which
shut
henry
and
de
la
mole
into
the
same
room
she
gave
the
count
an
affectionate
glance
and
addressing
her
husband
she
said
come
sire
it
is
not
sufficient
to
have
made
madame
my
mother
believe
in
what
is
not
it
still
remains
for
you
to
convince
your
whole
court
that
a
perfect
understanding
exists
between
us
but
make
yourself
quite
easy
added
she
laughing
and
remember
my
words
rendered
almost
solemn
by
the
circumstances
will
be
the
last
time
that
i
shall
put
your
majesty
to
such
a
cruel
test
the
king
of
navarre
smiled
and
ordered
his
gentlemen
to
be
admitted
just
as
they
were
bowing
to
him
he
pretended
suddenly
to
recollect
having
left
his
mantle
on
the
queen
bed
and
begged
their
excuse
for
receiving
them
in
such
a
way
then
taking
his
mantle
from
the
hands
of
marguerite
who
stood
blushing
by
his
side
he
clasped
it
on
his
shoulder
next
turning
to
his
gentlemen
he
inquired
what
news
there
was
in
the
city
and
at
court
marguerite
was
engaged
in
watching
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
the
imperceptible
signs
of
astonishment
betrayed
by
the
gentlemen
at
detecting
this
newly
revealed
intimacy
between
the
king
and
queen
of
navarre
when
an
usher
entered
followed
by
three
or
four
gentlemen
and
announced
the
duc
to
bring
him
there
gillonne
had
only
to
tell
him
that
the
king
had
spent
the
night
in
the
queen
room
françois
rushed
in
so
precipitately
that
he
almost
upset
those
who
preceded
him
his
first
glance
was
for
henry
his
next
was
for
marguerite
henry
replied
with
a
courteous
bow
marguerite
composed
her
features
so
that
they
expressed
the
utmost
serenity
then
the
duke
cast
a
vague
but
scrutinizing
look
around
the
whole
room
he
saw
the
two
pillows
placed
at
the
head
of
the
bed
the
derangement
of
its
tapestried
coverings
and
the
king
hat
thrown
on
a
chair
he
turned
pale
but
quickly
recovering
himself
he
said
does
my
royal
brother
henry
join
this
morning
with
the
king
in
his
game
of
tennis
does
his
majesty
do
me
the
honor
to
select
me
as
his
partner
inquired
henry
or
is
it
only
a
little
attention
on
your
part
my
his
majesty
has
not
so
said
certainly
replied
the
duke
somewhat
embarrassed
but
do
you
generally
play
with
him
henry
smiled
for
so
many
and
such
serious
events
had
occurred
since
he
last
played
with
the
king
that
he
would
not
have
been
astonished
to
learn
that
the
king
had
changed
his
habitual
companions
at
the
game
i
shall
go
there
said
henry
with
a
smile
come
cried
the
duke
are
you
going
away
inquired
marguerite
yes
sister
are
you
in
great
haste
in
great
haste
might
i
venture
to
detain
you
for
a
few
minutes
such
a
request
was
so
unusual
coming
from
marguerite
that
her
brother
looked
at
her
while
her
color
came
and
went
what
can
she
be
going
to
say
to
him
thought
henry
no
less
surprised
than
the
duke
himself
marguerite
as
if
she
had
guessed
her
husband
thought
turned
toward
him
sire
said
she
with
a
charming
smile
you
may
go
back
to
his
majesty
if
it
seem
good
to
you
for
the
secret
which
i
am
going
to
reveal
to
my
brother
is
already
known
to
you
for
the
reason
that
the
request
which
i
made
you
yesterday
in
regard
to
this
secret
was
as
good
as
refused
by
your
majesty
i
should
not
wish
therefore
continued
marguerite
to
weary
your
majesty
a
second
time
by
expressing
in
your
presence
a
wish
which
seemed
to
be
disagreeable
what
do
you
mean
asked
françois
looking
at
both
of
them
with
astonishment
aha
exclaimed
henry
flushing
with
indignation
i
know
what
you
mean
madame
in
truth
i
regret
that
i
am
not
free
but
if
i
can
not
offer
monsieur
de
la
mole
such
hospitality
as
would
be
equivalent
to
an
assurance
i
can
not
do
less
than
to
recommend
to
my
brother
the
person
whom
you
feel
such
a
lively
perhaps
he
added
in
order
to
give
still
more
emphasis
to
the
words
italicized
perhaps
my
brother
will
discover
some
way
whereby
you
will
be
permitted
to
keep
monsieur
de
la
mole
here
near
you
that
would
be
better
than
anything
else
would
it
not
madame
come
come
said
marguerite
to
herself
the
two
together
will
do
what
neither
of
them
would
do
individually
and
she
opened
the
closet
door
and
invited
the
wounded
young
man
to
come
forth
saying
to
henry
as
she
did
so
your
majesty
must
now
explain
to
my
brother
why
we
are
interested
in
monsieur
de
la
mole
henry
caught
in
the
snare
briefly
related
to
half
a
protestant
for
the
sake
of
opposition
as
he
himself
was
partly
a
catholic
from
prudence
the
arrival
of
monsieur
de
la
mole
at
paris
and
how
the
young
man
had
been
severely
wounded
while
bringing
to
him
a
letter
from
when
the
duke
turned
round
la
mole
had
come
out
from
the
closet
and
was
standing
before
him
françois
at
the
sight
of
him
so
handsome
so
pale
and
consequently
doubly
captivating
by
reason
of
his
good
looks
and
his
pallor
felt
a
new
sense
of
distrust
spring
up
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
marguerite
held
him
both
through
jealousy
and
through
pride
brother
said
marguerite
i
will
engage
that
this
young
gentleman
will
be
useful
to
whoever
may
employ
him
should
you
accept
his
services
he
will
obtain
a
powerful
protector
and
you
a
devoted
servitor
in
such
times
as
the
present
brother
continued
she
we
can
not
be
too
well
surrounded
by
devoted
friends
more
especially
added
she
lowering
her
voice
so
as
to
be
heard
by
no
one
but
the
duke
when
one
is
ambitious
and
has
the
misfortune
to
be
only
third
in
the
succession
to
the
throne
then
she
put
her
finger
on
her
lip
to
intimate
to
françois
that
in
spite
of
the
initiation
she
still
kept
secret
an
important
part
of
her
idea
perhaps
she
added
you
may
differ
from
henry
in
considering
it
not
befitting
that
this
young
gentleman
should
remain
so
immediately
in
the
vicinity
of
my
apartments
sister
replied
françois
eagerly
if
it
meet
your
wishes
monsieur
de
la
mole
shall
in
half
an
hour
be
installed
in
my
quarters
where
i
think
he
can
have
no
cause
to
fear
any
danger
let
him
love
me
and
i
will
love
him
françois
was
untruthful
for
already
in
the
very
depths
of
his
heart
he
detested
la
mole
well
well
so
then
i
was
not
mistaken
said
marguerite
to
herself
seeing
the
king
of
navarre
scowling
face
ah
i
see
that
to
lead
you
two
one
must
lead
the
other
then
finishing
her
thought
there
you
are
doing
well
marguerite
henriette
would
say
in
fact
half
an
hour
later
la
mole
having
been
solemnly
catechised
by
marguerite
kissed
the
hem
of
her
gown
and
with
an
agility
remarkable
in
a
wounded
man
was
mounting
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
duc
quarters
two
or
three
days
passed
during
which
the
excellent
understanding
between
henry
and
his
wife
seemed
to
grow
more
and
more
firmly
established
henry
had
obtained
permission
not
to
make
a
public
renunciation
of
his
religion
but
he
had
formally
recanted
in
the
presence
of
the
confessor
and
every
morning
he
listened
to
the
mass
performed
at
the
louvre
at
night
he
made
a
show
of
going
to
his
wife
rooms
entered
by
the
principal
door
talked
a
few
minutes
with
her
and
then
took
his
departure
by
the
small
secret
door
and
went
up
to
madame
de
sauve
who
had
duly
informed
him
of
the
queen
mother
visit
as
well
as
the
unquestionable
danger
which
threatened
him
warned
on
both
sides
henry
redoubled
his
watchfulness
against
the
queen
mother
and
felt
all
distrust
of
her
because
little
by
little
her
face
began
to
unbend
and
one
morning
henry
detected
a
friendly
smile
on
her
bloodless
lips
that
day
he
had
the
greatest
difficulty
to
bring
himself
to
eat
anything
else
than
eggs
cooked
by
himself
or
to
drink
anything
else
than
water
which
his
own
eyes
had
seen
dipped
up
from
the
seine
the
massacres
were
still
going
on
but
nevertheless
were
diminishing
in
violence
there
had
been
such
a
wholesale
butchery
of
the
huguenots
that
their
number
was
greatly
reduced
the
larger
part
were
dead
many
had
fled
a
few
had
remained
in
concealment
occasionally
a
great
outcry
arose
in
one
district
or
another
it
meant
that
one
of
these
was
discovered
then
the
execution
was
either
private
or
public
according
as
the
victim
was
driven
into
a
corner
or
could
escape
in
such
circumstances
it
furnished
great
amusement
for
the
neighborhood
where
the
affair
took
place
for
instead
of
growing
calmer
as
their
enemies
were
annihilated
the
catholics
grew
more
and
more
ferocious
the
fewer
the
remaining
victims
the
more
bloodthirsty
they
seemed
in
their
persecution
of
the
rest
charles
ix
had
taken
great
pleasure
in
hunting
the
huguenots
and
when
he
could
no
longer
continue
the
chase
himself
he
took
delight
in
the
noise
of
others
hunting
them
one
day
returning
from
playing
at
mall
which
with
tennis
and
hunting
were
his
favorite
amusements
he
went
to
his
mother
apartments
in
high
spirits
followed
by
his
usual
train
of
courtiers
mother
he
said
embracing
the
florentine
who
observing
his
joy
was
already
trying
to
detect
its
cause
mother
good
news
de
tous
les
diables
do
you
know
that
the
admiral
illustrious
carcass
which
it
was
said
was
lost
has
been
found
aha
said
catharine
oh
heavens
yes
you
thought
as
i
did
mother
the
dogs
had
eaten
a
wedding
dinner
off
him
but
it
was
not
so
my
people
my
dear
people
my
good
people
had
a
clever
idea
and
have
hung
the
admiral
up
at
the
gibbet
of
montfaucon
haut
en
bas
gaspard
on
a
jété
puis
de
bas
en
haut
on
well
said
catharine
well
good
mother
replied
charles
i
have
a
strong
desire
to
see
him
again
dear
old
man
now
i
know
he
is
really
dead
it
is
very
fine
weather
and
everything
seems
to
be
blooming
the
air
is
full
of
life
and
perfume
and
i
feel
better
than
i
ever
did
if
you
like
mother
we
will
get
on
horseback
and
go
to
montfaucon
willingly
my
son
said
catharine
if
i
had
not
made
an
appointment
which
i
can
not
defer
and
beside
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
man
of
such
importance
as
the
admiral
we
should
invite
the
whole
court
it
will
be
an
occasion
for
observers
to
make
curious
observations
we
shall
see
who
comes
and
who
stays
away
faith
you
are
right
mother
we
will
put
it
off
till
that
will
be
better
so
send
out
your
invitations
and
i
will
send
mine
or
rather
let
us
not
invite
any
one
we
will
only
say
we
are
going
and
then
every
one
will
be
free
mother
i
am
going
to
play
on
the
horn
you
will
exhaust
yourself
charles
as
ambroise
paré
is
always
telling
you
and
he
is
right
it
is
too
severe
an
exercise
for
you
bah
bah
bah
said
charles
i
wish
i
were
sure
nothing
else
would
be
the
cause
of
my
death
i
should
then
bury
every
one
here
including
harry
who
will
one
day
succeed
us
all
as
nostradamus
prophesies
catharine
frowned
my
son
she
said
mistrust
especially
all
things
that
appear
impossible
and
meanwhile
take
care
of
yourself
only
two
or
three
blasts
to
rejoice
my
dogs
poor
things
they
are
wearied
to
death
with
doing
nothing
i
ought
to
have
let
them
loose
on
the
huguenots
that
would
have
done
them
good
and
charles
ix
left
his
mother
room
went
into
his
armory
took
down
a
horn
and
played
on
it
with
a
vigor
that
would
have
done
honor
to
roland
himself
it
was
difficult
to
understand
how
so
weak
a
frame
and
such
pale
lips
could
blow
a
blast
so
powerful
catharine
in
truth
was
awaiting
some
one
as
she
had
told
her
son
a
moment
after
he
had
left
her
one
of
her
women
came
and
spoke
to
her
in
a
low
voice
the
queen
smiled
rose
and
saluting
the
persons
who
formed
her
court
followed
the
messenger
réné
the
florentine
the
man
to
whom
on
the
eve
of
saint
bartholomew
the
king
of
navarre
had
given
such
a
diplomatic
reception
had
just
entered
her
oratory
ah
here
you
are
réné
said
catharine
i
was
impatiently
waiting
for
you
réné
bowed
did
you
receive
the
note
i
wrote
you
yesterday
i
had
that
honor
did
you
make
another
trial
as
i
asked
you
to
do
of
the
horoscope
cast
by
ruggieri
and
agreeing
so
well
with
the
prophecy
of
nostradamus
which
says
that
all
my
three
sons
shall
reign
for
several
days
past
affairs
have
decidedly
changed
réné
and
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
possibly
fate
has
become
less
threatening
madame
replied
réné
shaking
his
head
your
majesty
knows
well
that
affairs
do
not
change
fate
on
the
contrary
fate
controls
affairs
still
you
have
tried
the
sacrifice
again
have
you
not
yes
madame
replied
réné
for
it
is
my
duty
to
obey
you
in
all
things
well
and
the
result
still
the
same
madame
what
the
black
lamb
uttered
its
three
cries
just
the
same
as
before
madame
the
sign
of
three
cruel
deaths
in
my
family
murmured
catharine
alas
said
réné
what
then
then
madame
there
was
in
its
entrails
that
strange
displacement
of
the
liver
which
we
had
already
observed
in
the
first
two
it
was
wrong
side
up
a
change
of
dynasty
still
still
still
the
same
muttered
catharine
yet
we
must
fight
against
this
réné
she
added
réné
shook
his
head
i
have
told
your
majesty
he
said
that
fate
rules
is
that
your
opinion
asked
catharine
yes
madame
do
you
remember
jeanne
horoscope
yes
madame
repeat
it
to
me
i
have
quite
forgotten
it
said
réné
reformidata
regina
that
means
i
believe
said
catharine
shalt
live
and
she
lacked
common
necessaries
poor
thing
shalt
die
and
we
laughed
at
her
shalt
be
greater
than
thou
hast
been
as
a
and
she
is
dead
and
sleeps
in
a
tomb
on
which
we
have
not
even
engraved
her
name
madame
your
majesty
does
not
translate
the
rightly
the
queen
of
navarre
lived
honored
for
all
her
life
she
enjoyed
the
love
of
her
children
the
respect
of
her
partisans
respect
and
love
all
the
more
sincere
in
that
she
was
poor
yes
said
catharine
i
grant
you
the
but
how
will
you
explain
that
nothing
more
easy
shalt
die
well
did
she
die
feared
so
much
so
that
she
would
not
have
died
had
not
your
majesty
feared
her
then
a
queen
thou
shalt
be
or
shalt
be
greater
than
thou
hast
been
as
a
this
is
equally
true
madame
for
in
exchange
for
a
terrestrial
crown
she
has
doubtless
as
a
queen
and
martyr
a
celestial
crown
and
besides
who
knows
what
the
future
may
reserve
for
her
posterity
catharine
was
excessively
superstitious
she
was
even
more
alarmed
at
réné
coolness
than
at
the
steadfastness
of
the
auguries
and
as
in
her
case
any
scrape
was
a
chance
for
her
boldly
to
master
the
situation
she
said
suddenly
to
him
without
any
other
transition
than
the
working
of
her
own
thoughts
are
any
perfumes
come
from
italy
yes
madame
send
me
a
boxful
of
which
of
the
last
of
those
catharine
stopped
of
those
the
queen
of
navarre
was
so
fond
of
asked
réné
exactly
i
need
not
prepare
them
for
your
majesty
is
now
as
skilful
at
them
as
i
am
you
think
so
said
catharine
they
certainly
succeed
has
your
majesty
anything
more
to
say
to
me
asked
the
perfumer
nothing
replied
catharine
thoughtfully
at
least
i
think
not
only
if
there
is
any
change
in
the
sacrifices
let
me
know
it
in
time
by
the
way
let
us
leave
the
lambs
and
try
the
hens
alas
madame
i
fear
that
in
changing
the
victim
we
shall
not
change
the
presages
do
as
i
tell
you
the
perfumer
bowed
and
left
the
apartment
catharine
mused
for
a
short
time
then
rose
and
returning
to
her
bedchamber
where
her
women
awaited
her
announced
the
pilgrimage
to
montfaucon
for
the
morrow
the
news
of
this
pleasure
party
caused
great
excitement
in
the
palace
and
great
confusion
in
the
city
the
ladies
prepared
their
most
elegant
toilets
the
gentlemen
their
finest
arms
and
steeds
the
tradesmen
closed
their
shops
and
the
populace
killed
a
few
straggling
huguenots
in
order
to
furnish
company
for
the
dead
admiral
there
was
a
tremendous
hubbub
all
the
evening
and
during
a
good
part
of
the
night
la
mole
had
spent
a
miserable
day
and
this
miserable
day
had
followed
three
or
four
others
equally
miserable
monsieur
to
please
his
sister
had
installed
him
in
his
apartments
but
had
not
seen
him
since
he
felt
himself
like
a
poor
deserted
child
deprived
of
the
tender
care
the
soothing
attention
of
two
women
the
recollection
of
one
of
whom
occupied
him
perpetually
he
had
heard
of
her
through
the
surgeon
ambroise
paré
whom
she
had
sent
to
him
but
what
he
heard
from
a
man
of
fifty
who
was
ignorant
or
pretended
to
be
ignorant
of
the
interest
felt
by
la
mole
in
everything
appertaining
to
marguerite
was
very
fragmentary
and
insufficient
gillonne
indeed
had
come
once
of
her
own
accord
be
it
understood
to
ask
after
him
and
the
visit
was
to
him
like
a
sunbeam
darting
into
a
dungeon
and
la
mole
had
remained
dazzled
by
it
and
had
expected
a
second
visit
and
yet
two
days
passed
and
she
had
not
appeared
as
soon
therefore
as
the
convalescent
heard
of
this
magnificent
reunion
of
the
whole
court
for
the
following
day
he
sent
to
ask
monsieur
the
favor
of
accompanying
it
the
duke
did
not
even
inquire
whether
la
mole
was
able
to
bear
the
fatigue
but
merely
answered
capital
let
him
have
one
of
my
horses
that
was
all
la
mole
wanted
maître
ambroise
paré
came
as
usual
to
dress
his
wounds
and
la
mole
explained
to
him
the
necessity
he
was
under
of
mounting
on
horseback
and
begged
him
to
put
on
the
bandages
with
double
care
the
two
wounds
both
that
on
the
breast
and
that
on
the
shoulder
were
closed
the
one
on
the
shoulder
only
pained
him
both
were
in
color
which
showed
that
they
were
in
a
fair
way
of
healing
maître
ambroise
paré
covered
them
with
gummed
taffetas
a
remedy
greatly
in
vogue
then
and
promised
la
mole
that
if
he
did
not
exert
himself
too
much
everything
would
go
well
la
mole
was
at
the
height
of
joy
save
for
a
certain
weakness
caused
by
loss
of
blood
and
a
slight
giddiness
attributable
to
the
same
cause
he
felt
as
well
as
could
be
besides
doubtless
marguerite
would
be
in
the
party
he
should
see
marguerite
again
and
when
he
remembered
what
benefit
he
had
received
from
the
sight
of
gillonne
he
had
no
doubt
that
her
mistress
would
have
a
still
more
efficacious
influence
upon
him
so
la
mole
spent
a
part
of
the
money
which
he
had
received
when
he
went
away
from
his
family
in
the
purchase
of
the
most
beautiful
white
satin
doublet
and
the
finest
embroidered
mantle
that
could
be
furnished
by
a
fashionable
tailor
the
same
tailor
procured
for
him
a
pair
of
those
perfumed
boots
such
as
were
worn
at
that
period
the
whole
outfit
was
brought
to
him
in
the
morning
only
a
half
hour
later
than
the
time
at
which
la
mole
had
ordered
it
so
that
he
had
not
much
fault
to
find
he
dressed
himself
quickly
looked
in
the
glass
and
found
that
he
was
suitably
attired
arranged
and
perfumed
then
by
walking
up
and
down
the
room
several
times
he
assured
himself
that
though
it
caused
him
some
sharp
pangs
still
the
happiness
which
he
felt
in
his
heart
would
render
these
physical
inconveniences
of
no
account
a
mantle
of
his
own
design
and
cut
rather
longer
than
they
were
worn
then
proved
to
be
very
becoming
to
him
while
he
was
thus
engaged
in
the
louvre
another
scene
of
a
similar
kind
was
going
on
at
the
hôtel
de
guise
a
tall
gentleman
with
red
hair
was
examining
before
a
glass
a
reddish
mark
which
went
across
his
face
very
disagreeably
he
combed
and
perfumed
his
mustache
and
while
he
was
perfuming
it
he
kept
spreading
over
that
unfortunate
mark
which
in
spite
of
all
the
cosmetics
then
in
use
persisted
in
reappearing
a
layer
of
white
and
red
but
as
the
application
was
insufficient
an
idea
came
to
him
a
hot
sun
an
august
sun
was
flashing
its
rays
into
the
he
made
his
way
down
there
took
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
with
his
nose
in
the
air
and
his
eyes
closed
he
walked
up
and
down
for
ten
minutes
fully
exposed
to
the
devouring
flame
which
fell
from
heaven
like
a
torrent
at
the
end
of
these
ten
minutes
owing
to
the
unexampled
ardor
of
the
sun
the
gentleman
face
had
acquired
such
a
brilliant
color
that
the
red
streak
was
now
no
more
in
harmony
with
the
rest
than
it
had
been
but
in
comparison
seemed
yellow
nevertheless
the
gentleman
did
not
seem
much
dissatisfied
with
this
rainbow
effect
which
he
did
his
best
to
bring
into
accord
with
the
rest
of
his
face
by
spreading
a
layer
of
vermilion
over
it
after
which
he
put
on
a
magnificent
suit
which
a
tailor
had
brought
to
his
room
without
any
commands
from
him
thus
attired
scented
and
armed
from
head
to
foot
he
again
went
down
into
the
and
began
to
pat
a
large
black
horse
whose
beauty
would
have
been
matchless
but
for
a
small
cut
like
his
own
made
by
a
reiter
sabre
in
one
of
the
last
civil
conflicts
yet
enchanted
with
the
good
steed
as
he
was
with
himself
the
gentleman
whom
no
doubt
our
readers
have
easily
recognized
was
on
his
back
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
any
of
the
others
and
making
the
of
the
hôtel
de
guise
resound
with
the
whinnying
of
the
charger
accompanied
by
exclamations
of
pronounced
in
every
variety
of
accent
according
as
he
compelled
the
horse
to
submit
to
this
authority
at
the
end
of
a
moment
the
horse
completely
subdued
recognized
by
his
obedience
and
subjection
his
master
legitimate
control
but
the
victory
had
not
been
obtained
without
noise
and
this
noise
which
was
perhaps
the
very
thing
our
gentleman
reckoned
upon
this
noise
had
attracted
to
the
windows
a
lady
whom
our
queller
of
horses
saluted
respectfully
and
who
smiled
at
him
in
the
most
agreeable
manner
five
minutes
later
madame
de
nevers
summoned
her
steward
sir
said
she
has
monsieur
le
comte
annibal
de
coconnas
been
furnished
a
suitable
breakfast
yes
madame
replied
the
steward
he
ate
this
morning
with
a
better
appetite
than
usual
very
well
sir
said
the
duchess
then
addressing
her
first
gentleman
in
waiting
monsieur
she
said
let
us
set
out
for
the
louvre
and
keep
an
eye
i
beg
on
monsieur
le
comte
annibal
de
coconnas
for
he
is
wounded
and
consequently
still
weak
and
i
would
not
for
all
the
world
any
accident
should
happen
to
him
that
would
make
the
huguenots
laugh
for
they
owe
him
a
spite
since
the
blessed
night
of
saint
bartholomew
and
madame
de
nevers
mounting
her
horse
went
joyfully
towards
the
louvre
which
was
the
general
rendezvous
it
was
two
in
the
afternoon
as
a
file
of
cavaliers
overflowing
with
gold
jewels
and
magnificent
garments
appeared
in
the
rue
saint
denis
entering
by
the
corner
of
the
cemetery
of
the
innocents
and
stretching
itself
out
in
the
sunlight
between
the
two
rows
of
gloomy
looking
houses
like
an
immense
reptile
with
variegated
rings

a
dead
enemy
body
always
smells
sweet
no
brilliant
company
however
could
give
any
idea
of
this
spectacle
the
rich
and
elegant
silk
dresses
bequeathed
as
a
magnificent
fashion
by
françois
to
his
successors
had
not
yet
been
changed
into
those
formal
and
sombre
vestments
which
came
into
fashion
under
henry
iii
so
that
the
costume
of
charles
less
rich
but
perhaps
more
elegant
than
those
of
preceding
reigns
displayed
its
perfect
harmony
in
our
day
no
similar
cortège
could
have
any
standard
of
comparison
for
when
we
wish
magnificence
of
display
we
are
reduced
to
mere
symmetry
and
uniform
pages
esquires
gentlemen
of
low
degree
dogs
and
horses
following
on
the
flanks
and
in
the
rear
formed
of
the
royal
cortège
an
absolute
army
behind
this
army
came
the
populace
or
rather
the
populace
was
everywhere
it
followed
trooped
alongside
and
rushed
ahead
there
were
shouts
of
and
for
there
were
distinguishable
in
the
procession
many
calvinists
to
hoot
at
and
the
populace
harbors
resentment
that
morning
charles
in
presence
of
catharine
and
the
duc
de
guise
had
as
a
perfectly
natural
thing
spoken
before
henry
of
navarre
of
going
to
visit
the
gibbet
of
montfaucon
or
rather
the
mutilated
corpse
which
had
been
suspended
from
it
henry
first
impulse
had
been
to
refuse
to
take
part
in
this
excursion
catharine
supposed
he
would
at
the
first
words
in
which
he
expressed
his
repugnance
she
exchanged
a
glance
and
a
smile
with
the
duc
de
guise
henry
detected
them
both
understood
what
they
meant
and
suddenly
recovering
his
presence
of
mind
said
but
why
should
i
not
go
i
am
a
catholic
and
am
bound
to
my
new
religion
then
addressing
the
king
your
majesty
may
reckon
on
my
company
he
said
and
i
shall
be
always
happy
to
accompany
you
wheresoever
you
may
go
and
he
threw
a
sweeping
glance
around
to
see
whose
brows
might
be
frowning
perhaps
of
all
that
cortège
the
person
who
was
looked
at
with
the
greatest
curiosity
was
that
motherless
son
that
kingless
king
that
huguenot
turned
catholic
his
long
and
marked
countenance
his
somewhat
vulgar
figure
his
familiarity
with
his
inferiors
which
he
carried
to
a
degree
almost
derogatory
to
a
king
a
familiarity
acquired
by
the
mountaineer
habits
of
his
youth
and
which
he
preserved
till
his
death
marked
him
out
to
the
spectators
some
of
whom
cried
to
mass
harry
to
mass
to
which
henry
replied
i
attended
it
yesterday
and
i
shall
attend
it
again
saint
gris
surely
that
is
sufficient
marguerite
was
on
horseback
so
lovely
so
fresh
so
elegant
that
admiration
made
a
regular
concert
around
her
though
it
must
be
confessed
that
a
few
notes
of
it
were
addressed
to
her
companion
the
duchesse
de
nevers
who
had
just
joined
her
on
a
white
horse
so
proud
of
his
burden
that
he
kept
tossing
his
head
well
duchess
said
the
queen
of
navarre
what
is
there
new
why
madame
replied
the
duchess
aloud
i
know
of
nothing
then
in
a
lower
tone
and
what
has
become
of
the
huguenot
i
have
found
him
a
retreat
almost
safe
replied
marguerite
and
the
wholesale
assassin
what
have
you
done
with
him
he
wished
to
take
part
in
the
festivity
and
so
we
mounted
him
on
monsieur
de
nevers
a
creature
as
big
as
an
elephant
he
is
a
fearful
cavalier
i
allowed
him
to
be
present
at
the
ceremony
as
i
felt
that
your
huguenot
would
be
prudent
enough
to
keep
his
chamber
and
that
there
was
no
fear
of
their
meeting
oh
faith
replied
marguerite
smiling
if
he
were
here
and
he
is
not
here
i
do
not
think
a
collision
would
take
place
my
huguenot
is
remarkably
handsome
but
nothing
more
a
dove
and
not
a
hawk
he
coos
but
does
not
bite
after
all
she
added
with
a
gesture
impossible
to
describe
and
shrugging
her
shoulders
slightly
after
all
perhaps
our
king
thought
him
a
huguenot
while
he
is
only
a
brahmin
and
his
religion
forbids
him
to
shed
blood
but
where
pray
is
the
duc
inquired
henriette
i
do
not
see
him
he
will
join
us
later
his
eyes
troubled
him
this
morning
and
he
was
inclined
not
to
come
but
as
it
is
known
that
because
he
holds
a
different
opinion
from
charles
and
his
brother
henry
he
inclines
toward
the
huguenots
he
became
convinced
that
the
king
might
put
a
bad
interpretation
on
his
absence
and
he
changed
his
mind
there
hark
people
are
gazing
and
shouting
yonder
it
must
be
that
he
is
coming
by
the
porte
montmartre
you
are
right
is
he
i
recognize
him
how
elegant
he
looks
said
henriette
for
some
time
he
has
taken
particular
pains
with
his
appearance
he
must
be
in
love
see
how
nice
it
is
to
be
a
prince
of
the
blood
he
gallops
over
every
one
they
all
draw
on
one
side
yes
said
marguerite
laughing
he
will
ride
over
us
for
sake
draw
your
attendants
to
one
side
duchess
for
there
is
one
of
them
who
will
be
killed
if
he
does
not
give
way
it
is
my
hero
cried
the
duchess
look
only
look
coconnas
had
left
his
place
to
approach
the
duchesse
de
nevers
but
just
as
his
horse
was
crossing
the
kind
of
exterior
boulevard
which
separates
the
street
from
the
faubourg
saint
denis
a
cavalier
of
the
duc
suite
trying
in
vain
to
rein
in
his
excited
horse
dashed
full
against
coconnas
coconnas
shaken
by
the
collision
reeled
on
his
colossal
mount
his
hat
nearly
fell
off
he
put
it
on
more
firmly
and
turned
round
furiously
heavens
said
marguerite
in
a
low
tone
to
her
friend
monsieur
de
la
mole
that
handsome
pale
young
man
exclaimed
the
duchess
unable
to
repress
her
first
impression
yes
yes
the
very
one
who
nearly
upset
your
piedmontese
oh
said
the
duchess
something
terrible
will
happen
they
look
at
each
other
recollect
each
other
coconnas
had
indeed
recognized
la
mole
and
in
his
surprise
dropped
his
bridle
for
he
believed
he
had
killed
his
old
companion
or
at
least
put
him
de
for
some
time
la
mole
had
also
recognized
coconnas
and
he
felt
a
fire
mount
up
into
his
face
for
some
seconds
which
sufficed
for
the
expression
of
all
the
sentiments
these
two
men
harbored
they
gazed
at
each
other
in
a
way
which
made
the
two
women
shudder
after
which
la
mole
having
looked
about
him
and
doubtless
seeing
that
the
place
was
ill
chosen
for
an
explanation
spurred
his
horse
and
rejoined
the
duc
coconnas
remained
stationary
for
a
moment
twisting
his
mustache
until
the
point
almost
entered
his
eye
then
seeing
la
mole
dash
off
without
a
word
he
did
the
same
ah
ha
said
marguerite
with
pain
and
contempt
so
i
was
not
mistaken
it
is
really
too
much
and
she
bit
her
lips
till
the
blood
came
he
is
very
handsome
added
the
duchesse
de
nevers
with
commiseration
just
at
this
moment
the
duc
reached
his
place
behind
the
king
and
the
queen
mother
so
that
his
suite
in
following
him
were
obliged
to
pass
before
marguerite
and
the
duchesse
de
nevers
la
mole
as
he
rode
before
the
two
princesses
raised
his
hat
saluted
the
queen
and
bowing
to
his
horse
neck
remained
uncovered
until
her
majesty
should
honor
him
with
a
look
but
marguerite
turned
her
head
aside
disdainfully
la
mole
no
doubt
comprehended
the
contemptuous
expression
of
the
queen
features
and
from
pale
he
became
livid
and
that
he
might
not
fall
from
his
horse
was
compelled
to
hold
on
by
the
mane
oh
oh
said
henriette
to
the
queen
look
cruel
that
you
are
he
is
going
to
faint
good
said
the
queen
with
a
cruel
smile
that
is
the
only
thing
we
need
where
are
your
salts
madame
de
nevers
was
mistaken
la
mole
with
an
effort
recovered
himself
and
sitting
erect
on
his
horse
took
his
place
in
the
duc
suite
meantime
they
kept
on
their
way
and
at
length
saw
the
lugubrious
outline
of
the
gibbet
erected
and
first
used
by
enguerrand
de
marigny
never
before
had
it
been
so
adorned
the
ushers
and
guards
went
forward
and
made
a
wide
circle
around
the
enclosure
as
they
drew
near
the
crows
perched
on
the
gibbet
flew
away
with
croakings
of
despair
the
gibbet
erected
at
montfaucon
generally
offered
behind
its
posts
a
shelter
for
the
dogs
that
gathered
there
attracted
by
frequent
prey
and
for
philosophic
bandits
who
came
to
ponder
on
the
sad
chances
of
fortune
that
day
at
montfaucon
there
were
apparently
neither
dogs
nor
bandits
the
ushers
and
guards
had
scared
away
the
dogs
together
with
the
crows
and
the
bandits
had
mingled
with
the
throng
so
as
to
make
some
of
the
lucky
hits
which
are
the
more
cheerful
vicissitudes
of
their
profession
the
procession
moved
forward
the
king
and
catharine
arrived
first
then
came
the
duc
duc
the
king
of
navarre
monsieur
de
guise
and
their
followers
then
madame
marguerite
the
duchesse
de
nevers
and
all
the
women
who
composed
what
was
called
the
flying
squadron
then
the
pages
squires
attendants
and
people
in
all
ten
thousand
persons
from
the
principal
gibbet
hung
a
misshapen
mass
a
black
corpse
stained
with
coagulated
blood
and
mud
whitened
by
layers
of
dust
the
carcass
was
headless
and
it
was
hung
by
the
legs
and
the
populace
ingenious
as
it
always
is
had
replaced
the
head
with
a
bunch
of
straw
to
which
was
fastened
a
mask
and
in
the
mouth
of
this
mask
some
wag
knowing
the
admiral
habit
had
introduced
a
toothpick
at
once
appalling
and
singular
was
the
spectacle
of
all
these
elegant
lords
and
handsome
ladies
like
a
procession
painted
by
goya
riding
along
in
the
midst
of
those
blackened
carcasses
and
gibbets
with
their
long
lean
arms
the
noisier
the
exultation
of
the
spectators
the
more
strikingly
it
contrasted
with
the
melancholy
silence
and
cold
insensibility
of
those
corpses
objects
of
ridicule
which
made
even
the
jesters
shudder
many
could
scarcely
endure
this
horrible
spectacle
and
by
his
pallor
might
be
distinguished
in
the
centre
of
collected
huguenots
henry
who
great
as
was
his
power
of
and
the
degree
of
dissimulation
conferred
on
him
by
heaven
could
no
longer
bear
it
he
made
as
his
excuse
the
strong
stench
which
emanated
from
all
those
human
remains
and
going
to
charles
who
with
catharine
had
stopped
in
front
of
the
admiral
dead
body
he
said
sire
does
not
your
majesty
find
that
this
poor
carcass
smells
so
strong
that
it
is
impossible
to
remain
near
it
any
longer
do
you
find
it
so
harry
inquired
the
king
his
eyes
sparkling
with
ferocious
joy
yes
sire
well
then
i
am
not
of
your
opinion
a
dead
enemy
corpse
always
smells
sweet
faith
sire
said
tavannes
since
your
majesty
knew
that
we
were
going
to
make
a
little
call
on
the
admiral
you
should
have
invited
pierre
ronsard
your
teacher
of
poetry
he
would
have
extemporized
an
epitaph
for
the
old
gaspard
there
is
no
need
of
him
for
that
said
charles
after
an
thought
mais
mal
entendu
lui
le
mot
est
trop
honnête
est
les
pieds
à
faute
de
tête
bravo
bravo
cried
the
catholic
gentlemen
in
unison
while
the
collected
huguenots
scowled
and
kept
silent
and
henry
as
he
was
talking
with
marguerite
and
madame
de
nevers
pretended
not
to
have
heard
come
come
sir
said
catharine
who
in
spite
of
the
perfumes
with
which
she
was
covered
began
to
be
made
ill
by
the
odor
come
however
agreeable
company
may
be
it
must
be
left
at
last
let
us
therefore
say
to
the
admiral
and
return
to
paris
she
nodded
ironically
as
when
one
takes
leave
of
a
friend
and
taking
the
head
of
the
column
turned
to
the
road
while
the
cortège
defiled
before
coligny
corpse
the
sun
was
sinking
in
the
horizon
the
throng
followed
fast
on
their
majesties
so
as
to
enjoy
to
the
very
end
all
the
splendors
of
the
procession
and
the
details
of
the
spectacle
the
thieves
followed
the
populace
so
that
in
ten
minutes
after
the
king
departure
there
was
no
person
about
the
mutilated
carcass
on
which
now
blew
the
first
breezes
of
the
evening
when
we
say
no
person
we
err
a
gentleman
mounted
on
a
black
horse
and
who
doubtless
could
not
contemplate
at
his
ease
the
black
mutilated
trunk
when
it
was
honored
by
the
presence
of
princes
had
remained
behind
and
was
examining
in
all
their
details
the
bolts
stone
pillars
chains
and
in
fact
the
gibbet
which
no
doubt
appeared
to
him
but
lately
arrived
in
paris
and
ignorant
of
the
perfection
to
which
things
could
be
brought
in
the
capital
the
paragon
of
all
that
man
could
invent
in
the
way
of
awful
ugliness
we
need
hardly
inform
our
friends
that
this
man
was
annibal
de
coconnas
a
woman
practised
eye
had
vainly
looked
for
him
in
the
cavalcade
and
had
searched
among
the
ranks
without
being
able
to
find
him
monsieur
de
coconnas
as
we
have
said
was
standing
ecstatically
contemplating
enguerrand
de
marigny
work
but
this
woman
was
not
the
only
person
who
was
trying
to
find
monsieur
de
coconnas
another
gentleman
noticeable
for
his
white
satin
doublet
and
gallant
plume
after
looking
toward
the
front
and
on
all
sides
bethought
him
to
look
back
and
saw
coconnas
tall
figure
and
the
silhouette
of
his
gigantic
horse
standing
out
strongly
against
the
sky
reddened
by
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
then
the
gentleman
in
the
white
satin
doublet
turned
out
from
the
road
taken
by
the
majority
of
the
company
struck
into
a
narrow
footpath
and
describing
a
curve
rode
back
toward
the
gibbet
almost
at
the
same
time
the
lady
whom
we
have
recognized
as
the
duchesse
de
nevers
just
as
we
recognized
the
tall
gentleman
on
the
black
horse
as
coconnas
rode
alongside
of
marguerite
and
said
to
her
we
were
both
mistaken
marguerite
for
the
piedmontese
has
remained
behind
and
monsieur
de
la
mole
has
gone
back
to
meet
him
by
heaven
exclaimed
marguerite
laughing
then
something
is
going
to
happen
faith
i
confess
i
should
not
be
sorry
to
revise
my
opinion
about
him
marguerite
then
turned
her
horse
and
witnessed
the
manoeuvre
which
we
have
described
la
mole
as
performing
the
two
princesses
left
the
procession
the
opportunity
was
most
favorable
they
were
passing
by
a
footpath
which
led
up
the
hill
and
in
doing
so
passed
within
thirty
yards
of
the
gibbet
madame
de
nevers
whispered
a
word
in
her
captain
ear
marguerite
beckoned
to
gillonne
and
the
four
turned
into
this
cross
path
and
went
and
hid
behind
the
shrubbery
nearest
to
the
place
where
the
scene
which
they
evidently
expected
to
witness
was
to
take
place
it
was
about
thirty
yards
as
we
have
already
said
from
the
spot
where
coconnas
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
was
gesticulating
before
the
admiral
marguerite
dismounted
madame
de
nevers
and
gillonne
did
the
same
the
captain
then
got
down
and
took
the
bridles
of
the
four
horses
thick
green
furnished
the
three
women
a
seat
such
as
princesses
often
seek
in
vain
the
glade
before
them
was
so
open
that
they
would
not
miss
the
slightest
detail
la
mole
had
accomplished
his
circuit
he
rode
up
slowly
and
took
his
stand
behind
coconnas
then
stretching
out
his
hand
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
the
piedmontese
turned
round
oh
said
he
so
it
was
not
a
dream
you
are
still
alive
yes
sir
replied
la
mole
yes
i
am
still
alive
it
is
no
fault
of
yours
but
i
am
still
alive
by
heaven
i
know
you
again
well
enough
replied
coconnas
in
spite
of
your
pale
face
you
were
redder
than
that
the
last
time
we
met
and
i
said
la
mole
i
also
recognize
you
in
spite
of
that
yellow
line
across
your
face
you
were
paler
than
that
when
i
made
that
mark
for
you
coconnas
bit
his
lips
but
evidently
resolved
on
continuing
the
conversation
in
a
tone
of
irony
he
said
it
is
curious
is
it
not
monsieur
de
la
mole
particularly
for
a
huguenot
to
be
able
to
look
at
the
admiral
suspended
from
that
iron
hook
and
yet
they
say
there
are
people
extravagant
enough
to
accuse
us
of
killing
even
small
huguenots
sucklings
count
said
la
mole
bowing
i
am
no
longer
a
huguenot
i
have
the
happiness
of
being
a
catholic
bah
exclaimed
coconnas
bursting
into
loud
laughter
so
you
are
a
convert
sir
oh
that
was
clever
of
you
sir
replied
la
mole
with
the
same
seriousness
and
the
same
politeness
i
made
a
vow
to
become
a
convert
if
i
escaped
the
massacre
count
said
the
piedmontese
that
was
a
very
prudent
vow
and
i
beg
to
congratulate
you
perhaps
you
made
still
others
yes
i
made
a
second
answered
la
mole
patting
his
horse
with
entire
coolness
and
what
might
that
be
inquired
coconnas
to
hang
you
up
there
by
that
small
nail
which
seems
to
await
you
beneath
monsieur
de
coligny
what
as
i
am
now
asked
coconnas
alive
and
merry
no
sir
after
i
have
passed
my
sword
through
your
body
coconnas
became
purple
and
his
eyes
darted
flames
do
you
mean
said
he
in
a
bantering
tone
to
that
nail
yes
replied
la
mole
to
that
nail
you
are
not
tall
enough
to
do
it
my
little
sir
then
i
get
on
your
horse
my
great
replied
la
mole
ah
you
believe
my
dear
monsieur
annibal
de
coconnas
that
one
may
with
impunity
assassinate
people
under
the
loyal
and
honorable
excuse
of
being
a
hundred
to
one
forsooth
but
the
day
comes
when
a
man
finds
his
man
and
i
believe
that
day
has
come
now
i
should
very
well
like
to
send
a
bullet
through
your
ugly
head
but
bah
i
might
miss
you
for
my
hand
is
still
trembling
from
the
traitorous
wounds
you
inflicted
upon
me
my
ugly
head
shouted
coconnas
leaping
down
from
his
steed
down
down
from
your
horse
le
comte
and
draw
and
he
drew
his
sword
i
believe
your
huguenot
called
monsieur
de
coconnas
an
head
whispered
the
duchesse
de
nevers
do
you
think
he
is
bad
looking
he
is
charming
said
marguerite
laughing
and
i
am
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
fury
renders
monsieur
de
la
mole
unjust
but
hush
let
us
watch
in
fact
la
mole
had
dismounted
from
his
horse
with
as
much
deliberation
as
coconnas
had
shown
of
precipitation
he
had
taken
off
his
cloak
laid
it
leisurely
on
the
ground
drawn
his
sword
and
put
himself
on
guard
aïe
he
exclaimed
as
he
stretched
out
his
arm
ouf
muttered
coconnas
as
he
moved
his
for
both
as
it
will
be
remembered
had
been
wounded
in
the
shoulder
and
it
hurt
them
when
they
made
any
violent
movement
a
burst
of
laughter
ill
repressed
came
from
the
clump
of
bushes
the
princesses
could
not
quite
contain
themselves
at
the
sight
of
their
two
champions
rubbing
their
omoplates
and
making
up
faces
this
burst
of
merriment
reached
the
ears
of
the
two
gentlemen
who
were
ignorant
that
they
had
witnesses
turning
round
they
beheld
their
ladies
la
mole
resumed
his
guard
as
firm
as
an
automaton
and
coconnas
crossed
his
blade
with
an
emphatic
by
heaven
ah
ça
now
they
will
murder
each
other
in
real
earnest
if
we
do
not
interfere
there
has
been
enough
of
this
holá
gentlemen
holá
cried
marguerite
let
them
be
let
them
be
said
henriette
who
having
seen
coconnas
at
work
hoped
in
her
heart
that
he
would
have
as
easy
a
victory
over
la
mole
as
he
had
over
mercandon
son
and
two
nephews
oh
they
are
really
beautiful
so
exclaimed
marguerite
look
they
seem
to
breathe
fire
indeed
the
combat
begun
with
sarcasms
and
mutual
insults
became
silent
as
soon
as
the
champions
had
crossed
their
swords
each
distrusted
his
own
strength
and
each
at
every
quick
pass
was
compelled
to
restrain
an
expression
of
pain
occasioned
by
his
own
wounds
nevertheless
with
eyes
fixed
and
burning
mouth
half
open
and
teeth
clenched
la
mole
advanced
with
short
and
firm
steps
toward
his
adversary
who
seeing
in
him
a
most
skilful
swordsman
retreated
step
by
step
they
both
thus
reached
the
edge
of
the
ditch
on
the
other
side
of
which
were
the
spectators
then
as
if
his
retreat
had
been
only
a
simple
stratagem
to
draw
nearer
to
his
lady
coconnas
took
his
stand
and
as
la
mole
made
his
guard
a
little
too
wide
he
made
a
thrust
with
the
quickness
of
lightning
and
instantly
la
mole
white
satin
doublet
was
stained
with
a
spot
of
blood
which
kept
growing
larger
courage
cried
the
duchesse
de
nevers
ah
poor
la
mole
exclaimed
marguerite
with
a
cry
of
distress
la
mole
heard
this
cry
darted
at
the
queen
one
of
those
looks
which
penetrate
the
heart
even
deeper
than
a
and
taking
advantage
of
a
false
parade
thrust
vigorously
at
his
adversary
this
time
the
two
women
uttered
two
cries
which
seemed
like
one
the
point
of
la
mole
rapier
had
appeared
all
covered
with
blood
behind
coconnas
back
yet
neither
fell
both
remained
erect
looking
at
each
other
with
open
mouth
and
feeling
that
on
the
slightest
movement
they
must
lose
their
balance
at
last
the
piedmontese
more
dangerously
wounded
than
his
adversary
and
feeling
his
senses
forsaking
him
with
his
blood
fell
on
la
mole
grasping
him
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
endeavored
to
unsheath
his
poniard
la
mole
roused
all
his
strength
raised
his
hand
and
let
fall
the
pommel
of
his
sword
on
coconnas
forehead
coconnas
stupefied
by
the
blow
fell
but
in
his
fall
drew
down
his
adversary
with
him
and
both
rolled
into
the
ditch
then
marguerite
and
the
duchesse
de
nevers
seeing
that
dying
as
they
were
they
were
still
struggling
to
destroy
each
other
hastened
to
them
followed
by
the
captain
of
the
guards
but
before
they
could
reach
them
the
combatants
hands
unloosened
their
eyes
closed
and
letting
go
their
grasp
of
their
weapons
they
stiffened
in
what
seemed
like
their
final
agony
a
wide
stream
of
blood
bubbled
round
them
oh
brave
brave
la
mole
cried
marguerite
unable
any
longer
to
repress
her
admiration
ah
pardon
me
a
thousand
times
for
having
a
moment
doubted
your
courage
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
alas
alas
murmured
the
duchess
gallant
annibal
did
you
ever
see
two
such
intrepid
lions
madame
and
she
sobbed
aloud
heavens
what
ugly
thrusts
said
the
captain
endeavoring
to
stanch
the
streams
of
blood
holá
you
there
come
here
as
quickly
as
you
can
here
i
say
he
addressed
a
man
who
seated
on
a
kind
of
tumbril
or
cart
painted
red
appeared
in
the
evening
mist
singing
this
old
song
which
had
doubtless
been
suggested
to
him
by
the
miracle
of
the
cemetery

whose
repulsive

and

the
sweet
and

we
have
just

stopped
his

got
out
and
bending
over
the
two
bodies
said
these
be
terrible

sure
enough
but
i
have
made
worse
in

pray
inquired
marguerite
experiencing
in
spite
of
herself
a
certain
vague
terror
which
she
could
not
overcome

the

bowing
down
to

i

i

replied
marguerite
cast
your
corpses
down

spread
in
your
cart
the
housings
of

horses
and
bring
these
two
gentlemen
softly

maître

the

in
which
coconnas
and
la

were

started
back
toward
paris
following
in
the
shadow
the
guiding
group
it
stopped
at
the
louvre
and
the
driver
was
amply
rewarded
the
wounded
men
were
carried
to
the
duc
quarters
and
maître
ambroise
paré
was
sent
for
when
he
arrived
neither
of
the
two
men
had
recovered
consciousness
la
mole
was
the
least
hurt
of
the
two
the
sword
had
struck
him
below
the
right
armpit
but
without
touching
any
vital
parts
coconnas
was
run
through
the
lungs
and
the
air
that
escaped
from
his
wound
made
the
flame
of
a
candle
waver
ambroise
paré
would
not
answer
for
coconnas
madame
de
nevers
was
in
despair
relying
on
coconnas
strength
courage
and
skill
she
had
prevented
marguerite
from
interfering
with
the
duel
she
would
have
had
coconnas
taken
to
the
hôtel
de
guise
and
gladly
bestowed
on
him
a
second
time
the
care
which
she
had
already
lavished
on
his
comfort
but
her
husband
was
likely
to
arrive
from
rome
at
any
moment
and
find
fault
with
the
introduction
of
a
strange
man
in
the
domestic
establishment
to
hide
the
cause
of
the
wounds
marguerite
had
had
the
two
young
men
brought
to
her
brother
rooms
where
one
of
them
to
be
sure
had
already
been
installed
by
saying
that
they
were
two
gentlemen
who
had
been
thrown
from
their
horses
during
the
excursion
but
the
truth
was
divulged
by
the
captain
who
having
witnessed
the
duel
could
not
help
expressing
his
admiration
and
it
was
soon
known
at
court
that
two
new
had
burst
into
sudden
fame
attended
by
the
same
surgeon
who
divided
his
attentions
between
them
the
two
wounded
men
passed
through
the
different
phases
of
convalescence
arising
from
the
greater
or
less
severity
of
their
wounds
la
mole
who
was
less
severely
wounded
of
the
two
was
the
first
to
recover
consciousness
a
terrible
fever
had
taken
possession
of
coconnas
and
his
return
to
life
was
attended
by
all
the
symptoms
of
the
most
horrible
delirium
though
la
mole
was
confined
in
the
same
room
with
coconnas
he
had
not
when
he
came
to
himself
seen
his
companion
or
if
he
saw
him
he
betrayed
no
sign
that
he
saw
him
coconnas
on
the
contrary
as
soon
as
he
opened
his
eyes
fastened
them
on
la
mole
with
an
expression
which
proved
that
the
blood
he
had
lost
had
not
modified
the
passions
of
his
fiery
temperament
coconnas
thought
he
was
dreaming
and
that
in
this
dream
he
saw
the
enemy
he
imagined
he
had
twice
slain
only
the
dream
was
unduly
prolonged
after
having
observed
la
mole
laid
like
himself
on
a
couch
and
his
wounds
dressed
by
the
surgeon
he
saw
him
rise
up
in
bed
while
he
himself
was
still
confined
to
his
by
his
fever
his
weakness
and
his
pain
he
saw
him
get
out
of
bed
then
walk
first
leaning
on
the
surgeon
arm
and
then
on
a
cane
and
finally
without
assistance
coconnas
still
delirious
viewed
these
different
stages
of
his
companion
recovery
with
eyes
sometimes
dull
at
others
wandering
but
always
threatening
all
this
presented
to
the
piedmontese
fiery
spirit
a
fearful
mixture
of
the
fantastic
and
the
real
for
him
la
mole
was
dead
wholly
dead
having
been
actually
killed
twice
and
not
merely
once
and
yet
he
recognized
this
same
la
mole
ghost
lying
in
a
bed
like
his
own
then
as
we
have
said
he
saw
this
ghost
get
up
walk
round
and
horrible
to
relate
come
toward
his
bed
this
ghost
whom
coconnas
would
have
wished
to
avoid
even
had
it
been
in
the
depths
of
hell
came
straight
to
him
and
stopped
beside
his
pillow
standing
there
and
looking
at
him
there
was
in
his
features
a
look
of
gentleness
and
compassion
which
coconnas
took
for
the
expression
of
hellish
derision
there
arose
in
his
mind
possibly
more
wounded
than
his
body
an
insatiable
thirst
of
vengeance
he
was
wholly
occupied
with
one
idea
that
of
procuring
some
weapon
and
with
that
weapon
piercing
the
body
or
the
ghost
of
la
mole
which
so
cruelly
persecuted
him
his
clothes
stained
with
blood
had
been
placed
on
a
chair
by
his
bed
but
afterwards
removed
it
being
thought
imprudent
to
leave
them
in
his
sight
but
his
poniard
still
remained
on
the
chair
for
it
was
imagined
it
would
be
some
time
before
he
would
want
to
use
it
coconnas
saw
the
poniard
three
nights
while
la
mole
was
slumbering
he
strove
to
reach
it
three
nights
his
strength
failed
him
and
he
fainted
at
length
on
the
fourth
night
he
clutched
it
convulsively
and
groaning
with
the
pain
of
the
effort
hid
the
weapon
beneath
his
pillow
the
next
day
he
saw
something
he
had
never
deemed
possible
la
ghost
which
every
day
seemed
to
gain
strength
while
he
occupied
with
the
terrible
dream
kept
losing
his
in
the
eternal
weaving
of
the
scheme
which
was
to
rid
him
of
it
la
mole
ghost
growing
more
and
more
energetic
walked
thoughtfully
up
and
down
the
room
three
or
four
times
then
after
having
put
on
his
mantle
buckled
on
his
sword
and
put
on
a
felt
hat
opened
the
door
and
went
out
coconnas
breathed
again
he
thought
that
he
was
freed
from
his
phantom
for
two
or
three
hours
his
blood
circulated
more
calmly
and
coolly
in
his
veins
than
it
had
done
since
the
duel
la
mole
absence
for
one
day
would
have
restored
coconnas
to
his
senses
a
week
absence
would
perhaps
have
cured
him
unfortunately
la
mole
returned
at
the
end
of
two
hours
this
reappearance
of
la
mole
was
like
a
for
coconnas
and
although
la
mole
did
not
return
alone
coconnas
did
not
give
a
single
look
at
his
companion
and
yet
his
companion
was
worth
looking
at
he
was
a
man
of
forty
short
and
vigorous
with
black
hair
which
came
to
his
eyebrows
and
a
black
beard
which
contrary
to
the
fashion
of
the
period
thickly
covered
the
chin
but
he
seemed
one
who
cared
little
for
the
fashion
he
wore
a
leather
jerkin
all
covered
with
brown
spots
red
hose
and
leggings
thick
shoes
coming
above
the
ankle
a
cap
the
same
color
as
his
stockings
and
a
girdle
from
which
hung
a
large
knife
in
a
leather
sheaf
completed
his
attire
this
singular
personage
whose
presence
in
the
louvre
seemed
so
anomalous
threw
his
brown
mantle
on
a
chair
and
unceremoniously
approached
coconnas
whose
eyes
as
if
fascinated
remained
fixed
upon
la
mole
who
remained
at
some
distance
he
looked
at
the
sick
man
and
shaking
his
head
said
to
la
mole
you
have
waited
till
it
was
rather
late
my
dear
gentleman
i
could
not
get
out
sooner
said
la
mole
eh
heavens
you
should
have
sent
for
me
whom
had
i
to
send
true
i
forgot
where
we
are
i
had
told
those
ladies
but
they
would
not
listen
to
me
if
my
prescriptions
had
been
followed
instead
of
those
of
that
ass
ambroise
paré
you
would
by
this
time
have
been
in
a
condition
to
go
in
pursuit
of
adventures
together
or
exchange
another
if
such
had
been
your
good
pleasure
but
we
shall
see
does
your
friend
listen
to
reason
scarcely
hold
out
your
tongue
my
dear
gentleman
coconnas
thrust
out
his
tongue
to
la
mole
making
such
a
hideous
grimace
that
the
practitioner
shook
his
head
a
second
time
oho
he
muttered
contraction
of
the
muscles
there
no
time
to
be
lost
this
evening
i
will
send
you
a
potion
ready
prepared
you
must
make
him
take
it
three
times
once
at
midnight
once
at
one
and
once
at
two
very
well
but
who
will
make
him
take
it
i
will
you
yes
you
give
me
your
word
on
my
honor
and
if
any
physician
should
attempt
to
abstract
the
slightest
portion
to
analyze
it
and
discover
what
its
ingredients
are
i
will
spill
it
to
the
last
drop
this
also
on
your
honor
i
swear
it
whom
shall
i
send
you
this
potion
by
any
one
you
please
but
my
messenger
well
how
will
he
get
to
you
that
is
easily
managed
he
will
say
that
he
comes
from
monsieur
réné
the
perfumer
that
florentine
who
lives
on
the
pont
saint
michel
exactly
he
is
allowed
to
enter
the
louvre
at
any
hour
day
or
night
the
man
smiled
in
fact
said
he
the
queen
mother
at
least
owes
him
that
much
it
is
understood
then
he
will
come
from
maître
réné
the
perfumer
i
may
surely
use
his
name
for
once
he
has
often
enough
practised
my
profession
without
having
taken
his
degree
either
then
said
la
mole
i
may
rely
on
you
you
may
and
about
the
payment
oh
we
will
arrange
about
that
with
the
gentleman
himself
when
he
is
well
again
you
may
be
quite
easy
on
that
score
for
i
am
sure
he
will
pay
you
generously
i
believe
you
and
yet
he
added
with
a
strange
smile
as
the
people
with
whom
i
have
to
do
are
not
wont
to
be
grateful
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
when
he
is
on
his
legs
again
he
should
forget
or
at
least
not
think
to
give
a
single
thought
to
me
all
right
said
la
mole
smiling
also
in
that
case
i
should
have
to
jog
his
memory
very
well
we
leave
it
so
in
two
hours
you
will
receive
the
medicine
au
revoir
you
said
au
revoir
the
man
smiled
it
is
always
my
custom
he
added
to
say
adieu
so
adieu
monsieur
de
la
mole
in
two
hours
you
will
have
the
potion
you
understand
it
must
be
given
at
midnight
in
three
doses
at
intervals
of
an
hour
so
saying
he
took
his
departure
and
la
mole
was
left
alone
with
coconnas
coconnas
had
heard
the
whole
conversation
but
understood
nothing
of
it
a
senseless
babble
of
words
a
senseless
jangling
of
phrases
was
all
that
came
to
him
of
the
whole
interview
he
remembered
nothing
except
the
word
midnight
he
continued
to
watch
la
mole
who
remained
in
the
room
pacing
thoughtfully
up
and
down
the
unknown
doctor
kept
his
word
and
at
the
appointed
time
sent
the
medicine
which
la
mole
placed
on
a
small
silver
and
having
taken
this
precaution
went
to
bed
this
action
on
the
part
of
la
mole
gave
coconnas
a
little
quietude
he
tried
to
shut
his
eyes
but
his
feverish
slumbers
were
only
a
continuation
of
his
waking
delirium
the
same
phantom
which
haunted
him
by
day
came
to
disturb
him
by
night
across
his
hot
eyelids
he
still
saw
la
mole
as
threatening
as
ever
and
a
voice
kept
repeating
in
his
ear
midnight
midnight
midnight
suddenly
the
echoing
note
of
a
clock
bell
awoke
in
the
night
and
struck
twelve
coconnas
opened
his
eyes
the
fiery
breath
from
his
breast
scorched
his
dry
lips
an
unquenchable
thirst
devoured
his
burning
throat
the
little
night
lamp
was
burning
as
usual
and
its
dim
light
made
thousands
of
phantoms
dance
before
his
wandering
eyes
and
then
a
horrible
vision
he
saw
la
mole
get
out
of
bed
and
after
walking
up
and
down
the
room
two
or
three
times
as
the
flits
before
the
little
bird
it
is
trying
to
fascinate
come
toward
him
with
his
fist
clinched
coconnas
seized
his
poniard
and
prepared
to
plunge
it
into
his
enemy
la
mole
kept
coming
nearer
coconnas
muttered
ah
here
you
are
again
you
are
always
here
come
on
you
threaten
me
do
you
you
smile
come
come
come
ah
you
still
keep
coming
nearer
a
step
at
a
time
come
come
and
let
me
kill
you
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
just
as
la
mole
bent
down
to
him
coconnas
flashed
out
the
poniard
from
under
the
clothes
but
the
effort
he
made
in
rising
exhausted
him
the
weapon
dropped
from
his
hand
and
he
fell
back
upon
his
pillow
there
there
said
la
mole
gently
lifting
his
head
drink
this
my
poor
fellow
for
you
are
burning
up
it
was
really
a
cup
la
mole
presented
to
coconnas
who
in
the
wild
excitement
of
his
delirium
took
it
to
be
a
threatening
fist
but
at
the
nectarous
sensation
of
this
beneficent
draught
soothing
his
lips
and
cooling
his
throat
coconnas
reason
or
rather
his
instinct
came
back
to
him
a
never
before
experienced
feeling
of
comfort
pervaded
his
frame
he
turned
an
intelligent
look
at
la
mole
who
was
supporting
him
in
his
arms
and
smiling
on
him
and
from
those
eyes
so
lately
glowing
with
fury
a
tear
rolled
down
his
burning
cheek
which
drank
it
with
avidity
whispered
coconnas
as
he
fell
back
on
his
bolster
if
i
get
over
this
monsieur
de
la
mole
you
shall
be
my
friend
and
you
will
get
over
it
said
la
mole
if
you
will
drink
the
other
two
cups
and
have
no
more
ugly
dreams
an
hour
afterward
la
mole
assuming
the
duties
of
a
nurse
and
scrupulously
carrying
out
the
unknown
doctor
orders
rose
again
poured
a
second
dose
into
the
cup
and
carried
it
to
coconnas
who
instead
of
waiting
for
him
with
his
poniard
received
him
with
open
arms
eagerly
swallowed
the
potion
and
calmly
fell
asleep
the
third
cup
had
a
no
less
marvellous
effect
the
sick
man
breathing
became
more
regular
his
stiff
limbs
relaxed
a
gentle
perspiration
diffused
itself
over
his
burning
skin
and
when
ambroise
paré
visited
him
the
next
morning
he
smiled
complacently
saying
i
answer
for
monsieur
de
coconnas
now
and
this
will
not
be
one
of
the
least
difficult
cures
i
have
effected
this
scene
and
yet
not
lacking
in
a
certain
poetic
touch
when
coconnas
fierce
ways
were
taken
into
consideration
resulted
in
the
friendship
which
the
two
gentlemen
had
begun
at
the
inn
of
the
and
which
had
been
so
violently
interrupted
by
the
saint
bartholomew
night
occurrences
from
that
time
forth
taking
on
a
new
vigor
and
soon
surpassing
that
of
orestes
and
pylades
by
five
and
one
exchanged
between
them
at
all
events
wounds
old
and
new
slight
or
serious
were
at
last
in
a
fair
way
of
cure
la
mole
faithful
to
his
duties
as
nurse
would
not
forsake
the
until
coconnas
was
entirely
well
as
long
as
weakness
kept
the
invalid
on
the
bed
he
lifted
him
and
when
he
began
to
improve
he
helped
him
to
walk
in
a
word
he
lavished
on
him
all
the
attentions
suggested
by
his
gentle
and
affectionate
disposition
and
this
care
together
with
the
piedmontese
natural
vigor
brought
about
a
more
rapid
convalescence
than
would
have
been
expected
however
one
and
the
same
thought
tormented
both
the
young
men
each
had
in
his
delirium
apparently
seen
the
woman
he
loved
approach
his
couch
and
yet
certainly
since
they
had
recovered
their
senses
neither
marguerite
nor
madame
de
nevers
had
entered
the
room
however
that
was
perfectly
comprehensible
the
one
wife
of
the
king
of
navarre
the
other
the
duc
de
guise
could
not
have
publicly
shown
two
simple
gentlemen
such
a
mark
of
evident
interest
could
they
no
la
mole
and
coconnas
could
not
make
any
other
reply
to
this
question
but
still
the
absence
of
the
ladies
tantamount
perhaps
to
utter
forgetfulness
was
not
the
less
painful
it
is
true
the
gentleman
who
had
witnessed
the
duel
had
come
several
times
as
if
of
his
own
accord
to
inquire
after
them
it
is
true
gillonne
had
done
the
same
but
la
mole
had
not
ventured
to
speak
to
the
one
concerning
the
queen
coconnas
had
not
ventured
to
speak
to
the
other
of
madame
de
nevers
chapter
xviii
the
ghosts
for
some
time
each
of
the
young
men
kept
his
secret
confined
to
his
own
heart
at
last
their
reserve
burst
its
barriers
and
the
thought
which
had
so
long
occupied
them
escaped
their
lips
and
both
cemented
their
friendship
by
this
final
proof
without
which
there
is
no
friendship
namely
perfect
confidence
they
were
both
madly
in
love
one
with
a
princess
and
the
other
with
a
queen
for
these
two
poor
suitors
there
was
something
frightful
in
the
almost
insuperable
distance
separating
them
from
the
objects
of
their
desires
and
yet
hope
is
a
sentiment
so
deeply
rooted
in
man
heart
that
in
spite
of
the
madness
of
their
love
they
hoped
they
both
as
they
recovered
from
their
illness
took
great
pains
with
their
personal
appearance
every
man
even
the
most
indifferent
to
physical
appearance
has
at
certain
times
mute
interviews
with
his
signs
of
intelligence
after
which
he
generally
leaves
his
confidant
quite
satisfied
with
the
interview
now
our
two
young
men
were
not
persons
whose
mirrors
were
compelled
to
give
them
harsh
advice
la
mole
delicate
pale
and
elegant
had
the
beauty
of
distinction
coconnas
powerful
and
had
the
beauty
of
strength
he
had
more
for
his
recent
illness
had
been
of
advantage
to
him
he
had
become
thinner
grown
paler
and
the
famous
scar
which
had
formerly
caused
him
so
much
anxiety
from
its
prismatic
relationship
to
the
rainbow
had
disappeared
giving
promise
probably
like
the
phenomenon
of
a
long
series
of
lovely
days
and
calm
nights
moreover
the
most
delicate
attentions
continued
to
be
lavished
on
the
two
wounded
men
and
each
of
them
on
the
day
when
he
was
well
enough
to
rise
found
a
on
the
nearest
his
bed
on
the
day
when
he
was
able
to
dress
himself
a
complete
suit
of
clothes
moreover
in
the
pocket
of
each
doublet
was
a
purse
which
they
each
kept
intending
of
course
to
return
in
the
proper
time
and
place
to
the
unknown
protector
who
watched
over
them
this
unknown
protector
could
not
be
the
prince
in
whose
quarters
the
two
young
men
resided
for
the
prince
had
not
only
never
once
paid
them
a
visit
but
he
had
not
even
sent
to
make
any
inquiry
after
them
a
vague
hope
whispered
to
each
heart
that
this
unknown
protector
was
the
woman
he
loved
so
the
two
wounded
men
awaited
with
intense
impatience
the
moment
when
they
could
go
out
la
mole
stronger
and
sooner
cured
than
coconnas
might
have
done
so
long
before
but
a
kind
of
tacit
convention
bound
him
to
his
friend
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
the
first
time
they
went
out
they
should
make
three
calls
the
first
should
be
upon
the
unknown
doctor
whose
suave
medicine
had
brought
such
a
remarkable
improvement
in
the
inflammation
of
lungs
the
second
to
the
dwelling
of
the
defunct
maître
la
hurière
where
each
of
them
had
left
his
portmanteau
and
horse
the
third
to
the
florentine
réné
who
uniting
to
his
title
of
perfumer
that
of
magician
not
only
sold
cosmetics
and
poisons
but
also
concocted
philters
and
delivered
oracles
at
length
after
two
months
passed
in
convalescence
and
confinement
the
day
arrived
we
used
the
word
confinement
the
use
of
it
is
accurate
because
several
times
in
their
impatience
they
had
tried
to
hasten
that
day
but
each
time
a
sentinel
posted
at
the
door
had
stopped
their
passage
and
they
had
learned
that
they
could
not
step
out
unless
maître
ambroise
paré
gave
them
their
now
one
day
that
clever
surgeon
having
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
two
invalids
were
if
not
completely
cured
at
least
on
the
road
to
complete
recovery
gave
them
this
and
about
two
in
the
afternoon
on
a
fine
day
in
autumn
such
as
paris
sometimes
offers
to
her
astonished
population
who
have
already
laid
up
a
store
of
resignation
for
the
winter
the
two
friends
arm
in
arm
set
foot
outside
the
louvre
la
mole
finding
to
his
great
satisfaction
on
an
armchair
the
famous
mantle
which
he
had
folded
so
carefully
before
the
duel
undertook
to
be
coconnas
guide
and
coconnas
allowed
himself
to
be
guided
without
resistance
or
reflection
he
knew
that
his
friend
was
taking
him
to
the
unknown
doctor
whose
potion
not
patented
had
cured
him
in
a
single
night
when
all
of
master
ambroise
paré
drugs
were
slowly
killing
him
he
had
divided
the
money
in
his
purse
into
two
parts
and
intended
a
hundred
for
the
anonymous
esculapius
to
whom
his
recovery
was
due
coconnas
was
not
afraid
of
death
but
coconnas
was
not
the
less
satisfied
to
be
alive
and
well
and
so
as
we
see
he
was
intending
to
recompense
his
deliverer
generously
la
mole
proceeded
along
the
rue
de
the
wide
rue
saint
honoré
the
rue
des
prouvelles
and
soon
found
himself
on
the
place
des
halles
near
the
ancient
fountain
at
the
place
which
is
at
the
present
time
called
the
carreau
des
halles
was
an
octagon
stone
building
surmounted
by
a
vast
wooden
lantern
which
was
again
surmounted
by
a
pointed
roof
on
the
top
of
which
was
a
weathercock
this
wooden
lantern
had
eight
openings
traversed
as
that
heraldic
piece
which
they
call
the
traverses
the
field
of
blazonry
by
a
kind
of
wooden
wheel
which
was
divided
in
the
middle
in
order
to
admit
in
the
holes
cut
in
it
for
that
purpose
the
head
and
hands
of
such
sentenced
person
or
persons
as
were
exposed
at
one
or
more
of
these
eight
openings
this
singular
arrangement
which
had
nothing
like
it
in
the
surrounding
buildings
was
called
the
pillory
an
irregular
crooked
limping
house
the
roof
spotted
with
moss
like
a
leper
skin
had
like
a
toadstool
sprung
up
at
the
foot
of
this
species
of
tower
this
house
was
the
executioner
a
man
was
exposed
and
was
thrusting
out
his
tongue
at
the
he
was
one
of
the
robbers
who
had
been
following
his
profession
near
the
gibbet
of
montfaucon
and
had
by
ill
luck
been
arrested
in
the
exercise
of
his
functions
coconnas
believed
that
his
friend
had
brought
him
to
see
this
singular
spectacle
and
he
joined
the
crowd
of
sightseers
who
were
replying
to
the
patient
grimaces
by
vociferations
and
gibes
coconnas
was
naturally
cruel
and
the
sight
very
much
amused
him
only
he
would
have
preferred
that
instead
of
gibes
and
vociferations
they
had
thrown
stones
at
a
convict
so
insolent
as
to
thrust
out
his
tongue
at
the
noble
lords
that
condescended
to
visit
him
so
when
the
moving
lantern
was
turned
on
its
base
in
order
to
show
the
culprit
to
another
portion
of
the
square
and
the
crowd
followed
coconnas
would
have
accompanied
them
had
not
la
mole
checked
him
saying
in
a
low
tone
we
did
not
come
here
for
this
well
what
did
we
come
for
then
asked
coconnas
you
will
see
replied
la
mole
the
two
friends
had
got
into
the
habit
of
addressing
each
other
with
the
familiar
thee
and
thou
ever
since
the
morning
of
that
famous
night
when
coconnas
had
tried
to
thrust
his
poniard
into
la
mole
vitals
and
he
led
coconnas
directly
to
a
small
window
in
the
house
which
abutted
on
the
tower
a
man
was
leaning
on
the
aha
here
you
are
gentlemen
said
the
man
raising
his
cap
and
showing
his
thick
black
hair
which
came
down
to
his
eyebrows
you
are
welcome
who
is
this
man
inquired
coconnas
endeavoring
to
recollect
for
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
seen
that
face
during
one
of
the
crises
of
his
fever
your
preserver
my
dear
friend
replied
la
mole
he
who
brought
to
you
at
the
louvre
that
refreshing
drink
which
did
you
so
much
good
oho
said
coconnas
in
that
case
my
friend
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
him
but
the
man
instead
of
returning
the
gesture
drew
himself
up
and
withdrew
from
the
two
friends
just
the
distance
occupied
by
the
curve
of
his
body
sir
he
said
to
coconnas
thanks
for
the
honor
you
wish
to
confer
on
me
but
it
is
probable
that
if
you
knew
me
you
would
not
do
so
faith
said
coconnas
i
declare
that
even
if
you
were
the
devil
himself
i
am
very
greatly
obliged
to
you
for
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
i
should
be
dead
at
this
time
i
am
not
exactly
the
devil
replied
the
man
in
the
red
cap
but
yet
persons
are
frequently
found
who
would
rather
see
the
devil
than
me
who
are
you
pray
asked
coconnas
sir
replied
the
man
i
am
maître
caboche
the
executioner
of
the
provostry
of
paris
ah
said
coconnas
withdrawing
his
hand
you
see
said
maître
caboche
no
no
i
will
touch
your
hand
or
may
the
devil
fetch
me
hold
it
out
really
wide
as
you
can
here
it
is
open
it
wider
wider
and
coconnas
took
from
his
pocket
the
handful
of
gold
he
had
prepared
for
his
anonymous
physician
and
placed
it
in
the
executioner
hand
i
would
rather
have
had
your
hand
entirely
and
solely
said
maître
caboche
shaking
his
head
for
i
do
not
lack
money
but
i
am
in
need
of
hands
to
touch
mine
never
mind
god
bless
you
my
dear
gentleman
so
then
my
friend
said
coconnas
looking
at
the
executioner
with
curiosity
it
is
you
who
put
men
to
the
rack
who
break
them
on
the
wheel
quarter
them
cut
off
heads
and
break
bones
aha
i
am
very
glad
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
sir
said
maître
caboche
i
do
not
do
all
myself
just
as
you
noble
gentlemen
have
your
lackeys
to
do
what
you
do
not
choose
to
do
yourself
so
have
i
my
assistants
who
do
the
coarser
work
and
despatch
clownish
fellows
only
when
by
chance
i
have
to
do
with
folks
of
quality
like
you
and
your
companion
for
instance
ah
then
it
is
another
thing
and
i
take
a
pride
in
doing
everything
myself
from
first
to
last
that
is
to
say
from
the
first
putting
of
the
to
the
decapitation
in
spite
of
himself
coconnas
felt
a
shudder
pervade
his
veins
as
if
the
brutal
wedge
was
pressing
his
leg
as
if
the
edge
of
the
axe
was
against
his
neck
la
mole
without
being
able
to
account
for
it
felt
the
same
sensation
but
coconnas
overcame
the
emotion
of
which
he
was
ashamed
and
desirous
of
taking
leave
of
maître
caboche
with
a
jest
on
his
lips
said
to
him
well
master
i
hold
you
to
your
word
and
when
it
is
my
turn
to
mount
enguerrand
de
marigny
gallows
or
monsieur
de
nemours
scaffold
you
alone
shall
lay
hands
on
me
i
promise
you
then
this
time
here
is
my
hand
as
a
pledge
that
i
accept
your
promise
said
coconnas
and
he
offered
the
executioner
his
hand
which
the
latter
touched
timidly
with
his
own
although
it
was
evident
that
he
had
a
great
desire
to
grasp
it
warmly
at
this
light
touch
coconnas
turned
rather
pale
but
the
same
smile
lingered
on
his
lips
while
la
mole
ill
at
ease
and
seeing
the
crowd
turn
as
the
lantern
did
and
come
toward
them
touched
his
cloak
coconnas
who
in
reality
had
as
great
a
desire
as
la
mole
to
put
an
end
to
this
scene
which
by
the
natural
bent
of
his
character
he
had
delayed
longer
than
he
would
have
wished
nodded
to
the
executioner
and
went
his
way
faith
said
la
mole
when
he
and
his
companion
had
reached
the
croix
du
trahoir
i
must
confess
we
breathe
more
freely
here
than
in
the
place
des
halles
decidedly
replied
coconnas
but
i
am
none
the
less
glad
at
having
made
maître
caboche
acquaintance
it
is
well
to
have
friends
everywhere
even
at
the
sign
of
the
said
la
mole
laughing
oh
as
for
poor
maître
la
hurière
said
coconnas
he
is
dead
and
dead
again
i
saw
the
arquebuse
spitting
flame
i
heard
the
thump
of
the
bullet
which
sounded
as
if
it
had
struck
against
the
great
bell
of
and
i
left
him
stretched
out
in
the
gutter
with
streams
of
blood
flowing
from
his
nose
and
mouth
taking
it
for
granted
that
he
is
a
friend
he
is
a
friend
we
shall
have
in
the
next
world
thus
chatting
the
two
young
men
entered
the
rue
de
sec
and
proceeded
toward
the
sign
of
the
which
was
still
creaking
in
the
same
place
still
presenting
to
the
traveller
its
astronomic
hearth
and
its
appetizing
inscription
coconnas
and
la
mole
expected
to
find
the
house
in
a
desperate
state
the
widow
in
mourning
and
the
little
ones
wearing
crêpe
on
their
arms
but
to
their
great
astonishment
they
found
the
house
in
full
swing
of
activity
madame
la
hurière
mightily
resplendent
and
the
children
gayer
than
ever
oh
the
faithless
creature
cried
la
mole
she
must
have
married
again
then
addressing
the
new
artémise
madame
said
he
we
are
two
gentlemen
acquaintances
of
poor
monsieur
la
hurière
we
left
here
two
horses
and
two
portmanteaus
which
we
have
come
to
claim
gentlemen
replied
the
mistress
of
the
house
after
she
had
tried
to
bring
them
to
her
recollection
as
i
have
not
the
honor
of
knowing
you
with
your
permission
i
will
go
and
call
my
husband
grégoire
ask
your
master
to
come
grégoire
stepped
from
the
first
kitchen
which
was
the
general
pandemonium
into
the
second
which
was
the
laboratory
where
maître
la
hurière
in
his
had
been
in
the
habit
of
concocting
the
dishes
which
he
felt
deserved
to
be
prepared
by
his
clever
hands
the
devil
take
me
muttered
coconnas
if
it
does
not
make
me
feel
badly
to
see
this
house
so
gay
when
it
ought
to
be
so
melancholy
poor
la
hurière
he
tried
to
kill
me
said
la
mole
but
i
pardon
him
with
all
my
heart
la
mole
had
hardly
uttered
these
words
when
a
man
appeared
holding
in
his
hand
a
in
the
bottom
of
which
he
was
browning
some
onions
stirring
them
with
a
wooden
spoon
la
mole
and
coconnas
gave
vent
to
a
cry
of
amazement
as
they
did
so
the
man
lifted
his
head
and
replying
by
a
similar
cry
dropped
his
retaining
in
his
hand
only
his
wooden
spoon
nomine
said
the
man
waving
his
spoon
as
he
would
have
done
with
a
sprinkler
filii
et
spiritus
maître
la
hurière
exclaimed
the
two
young
men
messieurs
de
coconnas
and
de
la
mole
cried
la
hurière
so
you
are
not
dead
asked
coconnas
why
can
it
be
that
you
are
alive
asked
the
landlord
nevertheless
i
saw
you
fall
said
coconnas
i
heard
the
crash
of
the
bullet
which
broke
something
in
you
i
do
know
what
i
left
you
lying
in
the
gutter
with
blood
streaming
out
of
your
nose
out
of
your
mouth
and
even
out
of
your
eyes
all
that
is
as
true
as
the
gospel
monsieur
de
coconnas
but
the
noise
you
heard
was
the
bullet
striking
against
my
sallat
on
which
fortunately
it
flattened
itself
but
the
blow
was
none
the
less
severe
and
the
proof
of
it
added
la
hurière
lifting
his
cap
and
displaying
a
pate
as
bald
as
a
man
knee
is
that
as
you
see
i
have
not
a
spear
of
hair
left
the
two
young
men
burst
out
laughing
when
they
saw
his
grotesque
appearance
aha
you
laugh
do
you
said
la
hurière
somewhat
reassured
you
do
not
come
then
with
any
evil
intentions
now
tell
us
maître
la
hurière
are
you
entirely
cured
of
your
bellicose
inclinations
faith
that
i
am
gentlemen
and
now
well
and
now
now
i
have
vowed
not
to
meddle
with
any
other
fire
than
that
in
my
kitchen
bravo
cried
coconnas
see
how
prudent
he
is
now
added
the
piedmontese
we
left
in
your
stables
two
horses
and
in
your
rooms
two
portmanteaus
oh
the
devil
replied
the
landlord
scratching
his
ear
well
two
horses
you
say
yes
in
your
stable
and
two
portmanteaus
yes
in
the
rooms
we
had
the
truth
is
do
you
see
you
thought
i
was
dead
did
you
certainly
we
did
you
will
agree
that
as
you
were
mistaken
i
also
might
be
what
in
believing
that
we
also
were
dead
you
were
perfectly
free
now
that
it
you
see
as
you
died
intestate
continued
maître
la
hurière
go
on
i
believed
something
i
was
mistaken
i
see
it
now
tell
us
what
was
it
you
believed
i
believed
that
i
might
consider
myself
your
heir
oho
exclaimed
the
two
young
men
nevertheless
i
could
not
be
more
grateful
to
find
that
you
are
alive
gentlemen
so
you
sold
our
horses
did
you
asked
coconnas
alas
cried
la
hurière
and
our
portmanteaus
insisted
la
mole
oh
your
portmanteaus
oh
no
cried
la
hurière
only
what
was
in
them
now
look
here
la
mole
persisted
coconnas
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
bold
rascal
suppose
we
disembowel
him
this
threat
seemed
to
have
great
effect
on
maître
la
hurière
who
stammered
out
these
words
well
gentlemen
i
rather
think
the
affair
can
be
arranged
listen
said
la
mole
i
am
the
one
who
has
the
greatest
cause
of
complaint
against
you
certainly
monsieur
le
comte
for
i
recollect
that
in
a
moment
of
madness
i
had
the
audacity
to
threaten
you
yes
with
a
bullet
which
flew
only
a
couple
of
inches
above
my
head
do
you
think
so
i
am
certain
of
it
if
you
are
certain
of
it
monsieur
de
la
mole
said
la
hurière
picking
up
his
with
an
innocent
air
i
am
too
thoroughly
at
your
service
to
give
you
the
lie
well
said
la
mole
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
make
no
demand
upon
you
what
my
dear
gentleman
except
aïe
aïe
groaned
la
hurière
except
a
dinner
for
myself
and
my
friends
every
time
i
find
myself
in
your
neighborhood
how
is
this
exclaimed
la
hurière
in
an
ecstasy
i
am
at
your
service
my
dear
gentleman
i
am
at
your
service
so
it
is
a
bargain
is
it
with
all
my
heart
and
you
monsieur
de
coconnas
continued
the
landlord
do
you
agree
to
the
bargain
yes
but
like
my
friend
i
must
add
one
small
condition
what
is
that
that
you
restore
to
monsieur
de
la
mole
the
fifty
crowns
which
i
owe
him
and
which
i
put
into
your
keeping
to
me
sir
when
was
that
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
you
sold
my
horse
and
my
portmanteau
la
hurière
showed
that
he
understood
ah
i
remember
said
he
and
he
stepped
toward
a
cupboard
and
took
out
from
it
one
after
the
other
fifty
crowns
which
he
brought
to
la
mole
very
well
sir
said
that
gentleman
very
well
serve
me
an
omelet
the
fifty
crowns
are
for
grégoire
oh
cried
la
hurière
in
truth
my
dear
gentlemen
you
are
genuine
princes
and
you
may
count
on
me
for
life
and
for
death
if
that
is
so
said
coconnas
make
us
the
omelet
we
want
and
spare
neither
butter
nor
lard
then
looking
at
the
clock
faith
you
are
right
la
mole
said
he
we
still
have
three
hours
to
wait
and
we
may
as
well
be
here
as
anywhere
else
all
the
more
because
if
i
am
not
mistaken
we
are
already
half
way
to
the
pont
saint
michel
and
the
two
young
men
went
and
sat
down
at
table
in
the
very
same
room
and
at
the
very
same
place
which
they
had
occupied
during
that
memorable
evening
of
the
of
august
when
coconnas
had
proposed
to
la
mole
to
play
each
against
the
other
the
first
mistress
which
they
should
have
let
us
grant
for
the
honor
of
the
morality
of
our
two
young
men
that
neither
of
them
this
evening
had
the
least
idea
of
making
such
a
proposition
to
his
companion
chapter
xix
the
abode
of
maître
réné
perfumer
to
the
queen
mother
at
the
period
of
this
history
there
existed
in
paris
for
passing
from
one
part
of
the
city
to
another
but
five
bridges
some
of
stone
and
the
others
of
wood
and
they
all
led
to
the
cité
there
were
le
pont
des
meuniers
le
pont
au
change
le
pont
le
petit
pont
and
le
pont
saint
michel
in
other
places
when
there
was
need
of
crossing
the
river
there
were
ferries
these
five
bridges
were
loaded
with
houses
like
the
pont
vecchio
at
florence
at
the
present
time
of
these
five
bridges
each
of
which
has
its
history
we
shall
now
speak
more
particularly
of
the
pont
saint
michel
the
pont
saint
michel
had
been
built
of
stone
in
in
spite
of
its
apparent
solidity
a
freshet
in
the
seine
undermined
a
part
of
it
on
the
of
january
in
it
had
been
rebuilt
of
wood
but
during
the
night
of
december
it
was
again
carried
away
about
in
other
words
years
anterior
to
the
epoch
which
we
have
reached
it
was
again
built
of
wood
and
though
it
needed
repairs
it
was
regarded
as
solid
enough
in
the
midst
of
the
houses
which
bordered
the
line
of
the
bridge
facing
the
small
islet
on
which
the
templers
had
been
burnt
and
where
at
the
present
time
the
platform
of
the
pont
neuf
rests
stood
a
wooden
panelled
house
over
which
a
large
roof
impended
like
the
lid
of
an
immense
eye
at
the
only
window
which
opened
on
the
first
story
over
the
window
and
door
of
the
ground
floor
hermetically
sealed
shone
a
reddish
light
which
attracted
the
attention
of
the
to
the
low
wide
façade
painted
blue
with
rich
gold
mouldings
a
kind
of
frieze
separating
the
ground
floor
from
the
first
floor
represented
groups
of
devils
in
the
most
grotesque
postures
imaginable
and
a
wide
scroll
painted
blue
like
the
façade
ran
between
the
frieze
and
the
window
with
this
inscription
réné
florentin
perfumer
de
sa
majesté
la
reine
mère
the
door
of
this
shop
was
as
we
have
said
well
bolted
but
it
was
defended
from
nocturnal
attacks
better
than
by
bolts
by
its
reputation
so
redoubtable
that
the
passengers
over
the
bridge
usually
described
a
curve
which
took
them
to
the
opposite
row
of
houses
as
if
they
feared
the
very
smell
of
the
perfumes
that
might
exhale
through
the
walls
more
than
this
the
right
and
left
hand
neighbors
doubtless
fearing
that
they
might
be
compromised
by
the
proximity
had
since
maître
réné
occupancy
of
the
house
taken
their
departure
one
after
the
other
so
that
the
two
houses
next
to
réné
were
left
empty
and
closed
yet
in
spite
of
this
solitude
and
desertedness
belated
had
frequently
seen
glittering
through
the
crevices
of
the
shutters
of
these
empty
habitations
strange
rays
of
light
and
had
felt
certain
they
heard
strange
noises
like
groans
which
proved
that
some
beings
frequented
these
abodes
although
they
did
not
know
if
they
belonged
to
this
world
or
the
other
the
result
was
that
the
tenants
of
the
two
buildings
contiguous
to
the
two
empty
houses
from
time
to
time
queried
whether
it
would
not
be
wise
in
them
to
do
as
their
neighbors
had
done
it
was
doubtless
owing
to
the
privilege
which
the
dread
of
him
widely
circulated
had
procured
for
him
that
maître
réné
had
ventured
to
keep
up
a
light
after
the
prescribed
hour
no
round
or
guard
moreover
would
have
dared
to
molest
him
a
man
doubly
dear
to
her
majesty
as
her
and
perfumer
as
we
suppose
that
the
reader
panoplied
by
the
philosophical
wisdom
of
this
century
no
longer
believes
in
magic
or
magicians
we
will
invite
him
to
accompany
us
into
this
dwelling
which
at
that
epoch
of
superstitious
faith
shed
around
it
such
a
profound
terror
the
shop
on
the
ground
floor
is
dark
and
deserted
after
eight
in
the
evening
the
hour
at
which
it
closes
not
to
open
again
until
next
morning
there
it
is
that
the
daily
sale
of
perfumery
unguents
and
cosmetics
of
all
kinds
such
as
a
skilful
chemist
makes
takes
place
two
apprentices
aid
him
in
the
retail
business
but
do
not
sleep
in
the
house
they
lodge
in
the
rue
de
la
colandre
in
the
evening
they
take
their
departure
an
instant
before
the
shop
closes
in
the
morning
they
wait
at
the
door
until
it
opens
this
shop
is
therefore
dark
and
deserted
as
we
have
said
in
this
shop
which
is
large
and
deep
there
are
two
doors
each
leading
to
a
staircase
one
of
these
staircases
is
in
the
wall
itself
and
is
lateral
and
the
other
is
exterior
and
visible
from
the
quay
now
called
the
quai
des
augustins
and
from
the
riverbank
now
called
the
quai
des
orfévres
both
lead
to
the
principal
room
on
the
first
floor
this
room
is
of
the
same
size
as
the
ground
floor
except
that
it
is
divided
into
two
compartments
by
tapestry
suspended
in
the
centre
and
parallel
to
the
bridge
at
the
end
of
the
first
compartment
opens
the
door
leading
to
the
exterior
staircase
on
the
side
face
of
the
second
opens
the
door
of
the
secret
staircase
this
door
is
invisible
being
concealed
by
a
large
carved
cupboard
fastened
to
it
by
iron
cramps
and
moving
with
it
when
pushed
open
catharine
alone
besides
réné
knows
the
secret
of
this
door
and
by
it
she
comes
and
departs
and
with
eye
or
ear
placed
against
the
cupboard
in
which
are
several
small
holes
she
sees
and
hears
all
that
occurs
in
the
chamber
two
other
doors
visible
to
all
eyes
present
themselves
at
the
sides
of
the
second
compartment
one
opens
into
a
small
chamber
lighted
from
the
roof
and
having
nothing
in
it
but
a
large
stove
some
alembecs
retorts
and
crucibles
it
is
the
alchemist
laboratory
the
other
opens
into
a
cell
more
singular
than
the
rest
of
the
apartment
for
it
is
not
lighted
at
all
has
neither
carpet
nor
furniture
but
only
a
kind
of
stone
altar
the
floor
slopes
from
the
centre
to
the
ends
and
from
the
ends
to
the
base
of
the
wall
is
a
kind
of
gutter
ending
in
a
funnel
through
whose
orifice
may
be
seen
the
dark
waters
of
the
seine
on
nails
driven
into
the
walls
are
hung
instruments
all
keen
or
pointed
with
points
as
fine
as
a
needle
and
edges
as
sharp
as
a
razor
some
shine
like
mirrors
others
on
the
contrary
are
of
a
dull
gray
or
murky
blue
in
a
corner
are
two
black
fowls
struggling
with
each
other
and
tied
together
by
the
claws
this
is
the
soothsayer
sanctuary
let
us
return
to
the
middle
chamber
that
with
two
compartments
here
the
common
herd
of
clients
are
introduced
here
ibises
from
egypt
mummies
with
gilded
bands
the
crocodile
yawning
from
the
ceiling
with
eyeless
sockets
and
loose
teeth
and
old
musty
volumes
torn
and
are
presented
to
the
visitor
eye
in
pellmell
confusion
behind
the
curtain
are
phials
singularly
shaped
boxes
and
vases
all
this
is
lighted
up
by
two
small
silver
lamps
exactly
alike
perhaps
stolen
from
some
altar
of
santa
maria
novella
or
the
church
dei
lervi
of
florence
these
supplied
with
perfumed
oil
cast
their
yellow
flames
around
the
sombre
vault
from
which
each
hangs
by
three
blackened
chains
réné
alone
his
arms
crossed
is
pacing
up
and
down
the
second
compartment
with
long
strides
and
shaking
his
head
after
a
lengthened
and
painful
musing
he
pauses
before
an
ah
ah
says
he
i
forget
to
turn
it
and
perhaps
the
sand
has
all
run
through
a
long
time
ago
then
looking
at
the
moon
as
it
struggled
through
a
heavy
black
cloud
which
seemed
to
hang
over
he
said
it
is
nine
if
she
comes
she
will
come
as
usual
in
an
hour
or
an
hour
and
a
half
then
there
will
be
time
for
all
at
this
moment
a
noise
was
heard
on
the
bridge
réné
applied
his
ear
to
the
orifice
of
a
long
tube
the
other
end
of
which
reached
down
the
street
terminating
in
a
heraldic
no
he
said
it
is
neither
nor
it
is
men
footsteps
and
they
stop
at
my
door
they
are
coming
here
and
three
sharp
knocks
were
heard
at
the
door
réné
hurried
downstairs
and
put
his
ear
against
the
door
without
opening
it
the
three
sharp
blows
were
repeated
who
there
asked
maître
réné
must
we
mention
our
names
inquired
a
voice
it
is
indispensable
replied
réné
well
then
i
am
the
comte
annibal
de
coconnas
said
the
same
voice
and
i
am
the
comte
lerac
de
la
mole
said
another
voice
which
had
not
as
yet
been
heard
wait
wait
gentlemen
i
am
at
your
service
and
at
the
same
moment
réné
drew
the
bolts
and
lifting
the
bars
opened
the
door
to
the
two
young
men
locking
it
after
him
then
conducting
them
by
the
exterior
staircase
he
introduced
them
into
the
second
compartment
la
mole
as
he
entered
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
under
his
cloak
he
was
pale
and
his
hand
trembled
without
his
being
able
to
repress
this
symptom
of
weakness
coconnas
looked
at
everything
one
after
the
other
and
seeing
the
door
of
the
cell
was
about
to
open
it
allow
me
to
observe
my
dear
young
gentleman
said
réné
in
his
deep
voice
and
placing
his
hand
on
coconnas
those
that
do
me
the
honor
of
a
visit
have
access
only
to
this
part
of
the
room
oh
very
well
replied
coconnas
besides
i
feel
like
sitting
down
and
he
took
a
seat
there
was
unbroken
silence
for
a
moment
maître
réné
was
waiting
for
one
or
the
other
of
the
young
men
to
open
the
conversation
maître
réné
at
length
said
coconnas
you
are
a
skilful
man
and
i
pray
you
tell
me
if
i
shall
always
remain
a
sufferer
from
my
wound
that
is
always
experience
this
shortness
of
breath
which
prevents
me
from
riding
on
horseback
using
my
sword
and
eating
larded
omelettes
réné
put
his
ear
to
coconnas
chest
and
listened
attentively
to
the
play
of
the
lungs
no
monsieur
le
comte
he
replied
you
will
get
well
really
yes
i
assure
you
well
you
fill
me
with
delight
there
was
silence
once
more
is
there
nothing
else
you
would
desire
to
know
le
comte
i
wish
to
know
said
coconnas
if
i
am
really
in
love
you
are
replied
réné
how
do
you
know
because
you
asked
the
question
by
heaven
you
are
right
but
with
whom
with
her
who
now
on
every
occasion
uses
the
oath
you
have
just
uttered
ah
said
coconnas
amazed
maître
réné
you
are
a
clever
man
now
la
mole
it
is
your
turn
la
mole
reddened
and
seemed
embarrassed
i
monsieur
réné
he
stammered
and
speaking
more
firmly
as
he
proceeded
do
not
care
to
ask
you
if
i
am
in
love
for
i
know
that
i
am
and
i
do
not
hide
it
from
myself
but
tell
me
shall
i
be
beloved
in
return
for
in
truth
all
that
at
first
seemed
propitious
now
turns
against
me
perchance
you
have
not
done
all
you
should
do
what
is
there
to
do
sir
but
to
testify
by
one
respect
and
devotion
to
the
lady
of
one
thoughts
that
she
is
really
and
profoundly
beloved
you
know
replied
réné
that
these
demonstrations
are
frequently
very
meaningless
then
must
i
despair
by
no
means
we
must
have
recourse
to
science
in
human
nature
there
are
antipathies
to
be
overcome
sympathies
which
may
be
forced
iron
is
not
the
lodestone
but
by
rubbing
it
with
a
lodestone
we
make
it
in
its
turn
attract
iron
yes
yes
muttered
la
mole
but
i
have
an
objection
to
all
these
sorceries
ah
then
if
you
have
any
such
objections
you
should
not
come
here
answered
réné
come
come
this
is
child
play
interposed
coconnas
maître
réné
can
you
show
me
the
devil
no
monsieur
le
comte
i
sorry
for
that
for
i
had
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
him
and
it
might
have
encouraged
la
mole
well
then
let
it
be
so
said
la
mole
let
us
go
to
the
point
at
once
i
have
been
told
of
figures
modelled
in
wax
to
look
like
the
beloved
object
is
that
one
way
an
infallible
one
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
experiment
likely
to
affect
the
life
or
health
of
the
person
beloved
nothing
let
us
try
then
shall
i
make
first
trial
said
coconnas
no
said
la
mole
since
i
have
begun
i
will
go
through
to
the
end
is
your
desire
mighty
ardent
imperious
to
know
what
the
obstacle
is
monsieur
de
la
mole
oh
exclaimed
la
mole
i
am
dying
with
anxiety
at
this
moment
some
one
rapped
lightly
at
the
street
door
so
lightly
that
no
one
but
maître
réné
heard
the
noise
doubtless
because
he
had
been
expecting
it
without
any
hesitation
he
went
to
the
and
put
his
ear
to
the
mouthpiece
at
the
same
time
asking
la
mole
several
idle
questions
then
he
added
suddenly
now
put
all
your
energy
into
your
wish
and
call
the
person
whom
you
love
la
mole
knelt
as
if
about
to
address
a
divinity
and
réné
going
into
the
other
compartment
went
out
noiselessly
by
the
exterior
staircase
and
an
instant
afterward
light
steps
trod
the
floor
of
his
shop
when
la
mole
rose
he
beheld
before
him
maître
réné
the
florentine
held
in
his
hand
a
small
wax
figure
very
indifferently
modelled
it
wore
a
crown
and
mantle
do
you
desire
to
be
always
beloved
by
your
royal
mistress
demanded
the
perfumer
yes
even
if
it
cost
me
my
life
even
if
my
soul
should
be
the
sacrifice
replied
la
mole
very
good
said
the
florentine
taking
with
the
ends
of
his
fingers
some
drops
of
water
from
a
ewer
and
sprinkling
them
over
the
figure
at
the
same
time
muttering
certain
latin
words
la
mole
shuddered
believing
that
some
sacrilege
was
committed
what
are
you
doing
he
asked
i
am
christening
this
figure
with
the
name
of
marguerite
what
for
to
establish
a
sympathy
la
mole
opened
his
mouth
to
prevent
his
going
any
further
but
a
mocking
look
from
coconnas
stopped
him
réné
who
had
noticed
the
impulse
waited
your
absolute
and
undivided
will
is
necessary
he
said
go
on
said
la
mole
réné
wrote
on
a
small
strip
of
red
paper
some
cabalistic
characters
put
it
into
the
eye
of
a
steel
needle
and
with
the
needle
pierced
the
small
wax
model
in
the
heart
strange
to
say
at
the
orifice
of
the
wound
appeared
a
small
drop
of
blood
then
he
set
fire
to
the
paper
the
heat
of
the
needle
melted
the
wax
around
it
and
dried
up
the
spot
of
blood
thus
said
réné
by
the
power
of
sympathy
your
love
shall
pierce
and
burn
the
heart
of
the
woman
whom
you
love
coconnas
true
to
his
repute
as
a
bold
thinker
laughed
in
his
mustache
and
in
a
low
tone
jested
but
la
mole
desperately
in
love
and
full
of
superstition
felt
a
cold
perspiration
start
from
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
now
continued
réné
press
your
lips
to
the
lips
of
the
figure
and
say
i
love
thee
come
marguerite
la
mole
obeyed
at
this
moment
the
door
of
the
second
chamber
was
heard
to
open
and
light
steps
approached
coconnas
curious
and
incredulous
drew
his
poniard
and
fearing
that
if
he
raised
the
tapestry
réné
would
repeat
what
he
said
about
the
door
he
cut
a
hole
in
the
thick
curtain
and
applying
his
eye
to
the
hole
uttered
a
cry
of
astonishment
to
which
two
women
voices
responded
what
is
it
exclaimed
la
mole
nearly
dropping
the
waxen
figure
which
réné
caught
from
his
hands
why
replied
coconnas
the
duchesse
de
nevers
and
madame
marguerite
are
there
there
now
you
unbelievers
replied
réné
with
an
austere
smile
do
you
still
doubt
the
force
of
sympathy
la
mole
was
petrified
on
seeing
the
queen
coconnas
was
amazed
at
beholding
madame
de
nevers
one
believed
that
réné
sorceries
had
evoked
the
phantom
marguerite
the
other
seeing
the
door
half
open
by
which
the
lovely
phantoms
had
entered
gave
at
once
a
worldly
and
substantial
explanation
to
the
mystery
while
la
mole
was
crossing
himself
and
sighing
enough
to
split
a
rock
coconnas
who
had
taken
time
to
indulge
in
philosophical
questionings
and
to
drive
away
the
foul
fiend
with
the
aid
of
that
holy
water
sprinkler
called
scepticism
having
observed
through
the
hole
in
the
curtain
the
astonishment
shown
by
madame
de
nevers
and
somewhat
caustic
smile
judged
the
moment
to
be
decisive
and
understanding
that
a
man
may
say
in
behalf
of
a
friend
what
he
can
not
say
for
himself
instead
of
going
to
madame
de
nevers
went
straight
to
marguerite
and
bending
his
knee
after
the
fashion
of
the
great
artaxerxes
as
represented
in
the
farces
of
the
day
cried
in
a
voice
to
which
the
whistling
of
his
wound
added
a
peculiar
accent
not
without
some
power
madame
this
very
moment
at
the
demand
of
my
friend
the
comte
de
la
mole
maître
réné
was
evoking
your
spirit
and
to
my
great
astonishment
your
spirit
is
accompanied
with
a
body
most
dear
to
me
and
which
i
recommend
to
my
friend
shade
of
her
majesty
the
queen
of
navarre
will
you
desire
the
body
of
your
companion
to
come
to
the
other
side
of
the
curtain
marguerite
began
to
laugh
and
made
a
sign
to
henriette
who
passed
to
the
other
side
of
the
curtain
la
mole
my
friend
continued
coconnas
be
as
eloquent
as
demosthenes
as
cicero
as
the
chancellor
de
and
be
assured
that
my
life
will
be
imperilled
if
you
do
not
persuade
the
body
of
madame
de
nevers
that
i
am
her
most
devoted
most
obedient
and
most
faithful
servant
but
stammered
la
mole
do
as
i
say
and
you
maître
réné
watch
that
we
are
not
interrupted
réné
did
as
coconnas
asked
by
heaven
monsieur
said
marguerite
you
are
a
clever
man
i
am
listening
to
you
what
have
you
to
say
i
have
to
say
to
you
madame
that
the
shadow
of
my
friend
for
he
is
a
shadow
and
he
proves
it
by
not
uttering
a
single
little
word
i
say
that
this
shadow
begs
me
to
use
the
faculty
which
material
bodies
possess
of
speaking
so
as
to
be
understood
and
to
say
to
you
lovely
shadow
the
gentleman
thus
disembodied
has
lost
his
whole
body
and
all
his
breath
by
the
cruelty
of
your
eyes
if
this
were
really
you
i
should
ask
maître
réné
to
plunge
me
in
some
sulphurous
pit
rather
than
use
such
language
to
the
daughter
of
king
henry
to
the
sister
of
king
charles
to
the
wife
of
the
king
of
navarre
but
shades
are
freed
from
all
earthly
pride
and
they
are
never
angry
when
men
love
them
therefore
pray
your
body
madame
to
love
the
soul
of
this
poor
la
mole
a
little
a
soul
in
trouble
if
ever
there
was
one
a
soul
first
persecuted
by
friendship
which
three
times
thrust
into
him
several
inches
of
cold
steel
a
soul
burnt
by
the
fire
of
your
eyes
fire
a
thousand
times
more
consuming
than
all
the
flames
of
hell
so
have
pity
on
this
poor
soul
love
a
little
what
was
the
handsome
la
mole
and
if
you
no
longer
possess
speech
ah
bestow
a
gesture
bestow
a
smile
upon
him
my
friend
soul
is
a
very
intelligent
soul
and
will
comprehend
everything
be
kind
to
him
then
or
by
heaven
i
will
run
my
sword
through
réné
body
in
order
that
by
virtue
of
the
power
which
he
possesses
over
spirits
he
may
force
yours
which
he
has
already
so
opportunely
evoked
to
do
all
a
shade
so
amiably
disposed
as
yours
appears
to
be
should
do
at
this
burst
of
eloquence
delivered
by
coconnas
as
he
stood
in
front
of
the
queen
like
æneas
descending
into
hades
marguerite
could
not
refrain
from
a
hearty
burst
of
laughter
yet
preserving
the
silence
which
on
such
an
occasion
may
be
the
supposed
characteristic
of
a
royal
shade
she
presented
her
hand
to
coconnas
he
took
it
daintily
in
his
and
calling
to
la
mole
said
shade
of
my
friend
come
hither
instantly
la
mole
amazed
overcome
silently
obeyed
is
well
said
coconnas
taking
him
by
the
back
of
the
head
and
now
bring
the
shadow
of
your
handsome
brown
countenance
into
contact
with
the
white
and
vaporous
hand
before
you
and
coconnas
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
raised
the
delicate
hand
to
la
mole
lips
and
kept
them
for
a
moment
respectfully
united
without
the
hand
seeking
to
withdraw
itself
from
the
gentle
pressure
marguerite
had
not
ceased
to
smile
but
madame
de
nevers
did
not
smile
at
all
she
was
still
trembling
at
the
unexpected
appearance
of
the
two
gentlemen
she
was
conscious
that
her
awkwardness
was
increased
by
all
the
fever
of
a
growing
jealousy
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
coconnas
ought
not
thus
to
forget
her
affairs
for
those
of
others
la
mole
saw
her
eyebrows
contracted
detected
the
flashing
threat
of
her
eyes
and
in
spite
of
the
intoxicating
fever
to
which
his
delight
was
insensibly
urging
him
to
succumb
he
realized
the
danger
which
his
friend
was
running
and
perceived
what
he
should
try
to
do
to
rescue
him
so
rising
and
leaving
marguerite
hand
in
coconnas
he
grasped
the
duchesse
de
nevers
and
bending
his
knee
he
said
o
loveliest
o
most
adorable
of
women
i
speak
of
living
women
and
not
of
shades
and
he
turned
a
look
and
a
smile
to
marguerite
allow
a
soul
released
from
its
mortal
envelope
to
repair
the
absence
of
a
body
fully
absorbed
by
material
friendship
monsieur
de
coconnas
whom
you
see
is
only
a
man
a
man
of
bold
and
hardy
frame
of
flesh
handsome
to
gaze
upon
perchance
but
perishable
like
all
flesh
caro
although
this
gentleman
keeps
on
from
morning
to
night
pouring
into
my
ears
the
most
touching
litanies
about
you
though
you
have
seen
him
distribute
as
heavy
blows
as
were
ever
seen
in
wide
france
this
champion
so
full
of
eloquence
in
presence
of
a
spirit
dares
not
address
a
woman
that
is
why
he
has
addressed
the
shade
of
the
queen
charging
me
to
speak
to
your
lovely
body
and
to
tell
you
that
he
lays
at
your
feet
his
soul
and
heart
that
he
entreats
from
your
divine
eyes
a
look
in
pity
from
your
rosy
fingers
a
beckoning
sign
and
from
your
musical
and
heavenly
voice
those
words
which
men
can
never
forget
if
not
he
has
supplicated
another
thing
and
that
is
in
case
he
should
not
soften
you
you
will
run
my
sword
which
is
a
real
blade
for
swords
have
no
shadows
except
in
the
sunshine
run
my
sword
right
through
his
body
for
the
second
time
for
he
can
live
no
longer
if
you
do
not
authorize
him
to
live
exclusively
for
you
all
the
verve
and
comical
exaggeration
which
coconnas
had
put
into
his
speech
found
their
counterpart
in
the
tenderness
the
intoxicating
vigor
and
the
mock
humility
which
la
mole
introduced
into
his
supplication
henriette
eyes
turned
from
la
mole
to
whom
she
had
listened
till
he
ended
and
rested
on
coconnas
to
see
if
the
expression
of
that
gentleman
countenance
harmonized
with
his
friend
ardent
address
it
seemed
that
she
was
satisfied
for
blushing
breathless
conquered
she
said
to
coconnas
with
a
smile
which
disclosed
a
double
row
of
pearls
enclosed
in
coral
is
this
true
by
heaven
exclaimed
coconnas
fascinated
by
her
look
it
is
true
indeed
oh
yes
madame
it
is
true
true
on
your
life
true
on
my
death
come
with
me
then
said
henriette
extending
to
him
her
hand
while
her
eyes
proclaimed
the
feelings
of
her
heart
coconnas
flung
his
velvet
cap
into
the
air
and
with
one
stride
was
at
the
young
woman
side
while
la
mole
recalled
to
marguerite
by
a
gesture
executed
at
the
same
time
an
amorous
with
his
friend
réné
appeared
at
the
door
in
the
background
silence
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
which
at
once
damped
all
the
ardor
of
the
lovers
silence
and
they
heard
in
the
solid
wall
the
sound
of
a
key
in
a
lock
and
of
a
door
grating
on
its
hinges
but
said
marguerite
haughtily
i
should
think
that
no
one
has
the
right
to
enter
whilst
we
are
here
not
even
the
queen
mother
whispered
réné
in
her
ear
marguerite
instantly
rushed
out
by
the
exterior
staircase
leading
la
mole
after
her
henriette
and
coconnas
almost
followed
them
all
four
taking
flight
as
fly
at
the
first
noise
the
birds
seen
engaged
in
loving
parley
on
the
boughs
of
a
flowering
shrub
chapter
xx
the
black
hens
it
was
time
the
two
couples
disappeared
catharine
was
putting
the
key
in
the
lock
of
the
second
door
just
as
coconnas
and
madame
de
nevers
stepped
out
of
the
house
by
the
lower
entrance
and
catharine
as
she
entered
could
hear
the
steps
of
the
fugitives
on
the
stairs
she
cast
a
searching
glance
around
and
then
fixing
her
suspicious
eyes
on
réné
who
stood
motionless
bowing
before
her
said
who
was
that
some
lovers
who
are
satisfied
with
the
assurance
i
gave
them
that
they
are
really
in
love
never
mind
them
said
catharine
shrugging
her
shoulders
is
there
no
one
else
here
no
one
but
your
majesty
and
myself
have
you
done
what
i
ordered
you
about
the
two
black
hens
yes
they
are
ready
madame
ah
muttered
catharine
if
you
were
a
jew
why
a
jew
madame
because
you
could
then
read
the
precious
treatises
which
the
hebrews
have
written
about
sacrifices
i
have
had
one
of
them
translated
and
i
found
that
the
hebrews
did
not
look
for
omens
in
the
heart
or
liver
as
the
romans
did
but
in
the
configuration
of
the
brain
and
in
the
shape
of
the
letters
traced
there
by
the
hand
of
destiny
yes
madame
so
i
have
heard
from
an
old
rabbi
there
are
said
catharine
characters
thus
marked
that
reveal
all
the
future
only
the
chaldean
seers
recommend
recommend
what
asked
réné
seeing
the
queen
hesitate
that
the
experiment
shall
be
tried
on
the
human
brain
as
more
developed
and
more
nearly
sympathizing
with
the
wishes
of
the
consulter
alas
said
réné
your
majesty
knows
it
is
impossible
difficult
at
least
said
catharine
if
we
had
known
this
at
saint
bartholomew
what
a
rich
harvest
we
might
have
had
the
first
convict
but
i
will
think
of
it
meantime
let
us
do
what
we
can
is
the
chamber
of
sacrifice
prepared
yes
madame
let
us
go
there
réné
lighted
a
taper
made
of
strange
substances
the
odor
of
which
both
insidious
and
penetrating
as
well
as
nauseating
and
stupefying
betokened
the
introduction
of
many
elements
holding
this
taper
up
he
preceded
catharine
into
the
cell
catharine
selected
from
amongst
the
sacrificial
instruments
a
knife
of
blue
steel
while
réné
took
up
one
of
the
two
fowls
that
were
huddling
in
one
corner
with
anxious
golden
eyes
how
shall
we
proceed
we
will
examine
the
liver
of
the
one
and
the
brain
of
the
other
if
these
two
experiments
lead
to
the
same
result
we
must
be
convinced
especially
if
these
results
coincide
with
those
we
got
before
which
shall
we
begin
with
with
the
liver
very
well
said
réné
and
he
fastened
the
bird
down
to
two
rings
attached
to
the
little
altar
so
that
the
creature
turned
on
its
back
could
only
struggle
without
stirring
from
the
spot
catharine
opened
its
breast
with
a
single
stroke
of
her
knife
the
fowl
uttered
three
cries
and
after
some
convulsions
expired
always
three
cries
said
catharine
three
signs
of
death
she
then
opened
the
body
and
the
liver
inclining
to
the
left
always
to
the
left
a
triple
death
followed
by
a
downfall
is
terrible
réné
we
must
see
madame
whether
the
presages
from
the
second
will
correspond
with
those
of
the
first
réné
unfastened
the
body
of
the
fowl
from
the
altar
and
tossed
it
into
a
corner
then
he
went
to
the
other
which
foreseeing
what
its
fate
would
be
by
its
companion
tried
to
escape
by
running
round
the
cell
and
finding
itself
pent
up
in
a
corner
flew
over
réné
head
and
in
its
flight
extinguished
the
magic
taper
catharine
held
you
see
réné
thus
shall
our
race
be
extinguished
said
the
queen
death
shall
breathe
upon
it
and
destroy
it
from
the
face
of
the
earth
yet
three
sons
three
sons
she
murmured
sorrowfully
réné
took
from
her
the
extinguished
taper
and
went
into
the
adjoining
room
to
relight
it
on
his
return
he
saw
the
hen
hiding
its
head
in
the
tunnel
this
time
said
catharine
i
will
prevent
the
cries
for
i
will
cut
off
the
head
at
once
and
accordingly
as
soon
as
the
hen
was
bound
catharine
as
she
had
said
severed
the
head
at
a
single
blow
but
in
the
last
agony
the
beak
opened
three
times
and
then
closed
forever
do
you
see
said
catharine
terrified
instead
of
three
cries
three
sighs
always
three
they
will
all
three
die
all
these
spirits
before
they
depart
count
and
call
three
let
us
now
see
the
prognostications
in
the
head
she
severed
the
bloodless
comb
from
the
head
carefully
opened
the
skull
and
laying
bare
the
lobes
of
the
brain
endeavored
to
trace
a
letter
formed
in
the
bloody
sinuosities
made
by
the
division
of
the
central
pulp
always
so
cried
she
clasping
her
hands
and
this
time
clearer
than
ever
see
here
réné
approached
what
is
the
letter
asked
catharine
an
h
replied
réné
how
many
times
repeated
réné
counted
four
said
he
ay
ay
i
see
it
that
is
to
say
henry
iv
oh
she
cried
flinging
the
knife
from
her
i
am
accursed
in
my
posterity
she
was
terrible
that
woman
pale
as
a
corpse
lighted
by
the
dismal
taper
and
clasping
her
bloody
hands
he
will
reign
she
exclaimed
with
a
sigh
of
despair
he
will
reign
he
will
reign
repeated
réné
plunged
in
meditation
nevertheless
the
gloomy
expression
of
catharine
face
soon
disappeared
under
the
light
of
a
thought
which
unfolded
in
the
depths
of
her
mind
réné
said
she
stretching
out
her
hand
toward
the
perfumer
without
lifting
her
head
from
her
breast
réné
is
there
not
a
terrible
history
of
a
doctor
at
perugia
who
killed
at
once
by
the
aid
of
a
pomade
his
daughter
and
his
daughter
lover
yes
madame
and
this
lover
was
was
king
ladislas
madame
ah
yes
murmured
she
have
you
any
of
the
details
of
this
story
i
have
an
old
book
which
mentions
it
replied
réné
well
let
us
go
into
the
other
room
and
you
can
show
it
me
they
left
the
cell
the
door
of
which
réné
closed
after
him
has
your
majesty
any
other
orders
to
give
me
concerning
the
sacrifices
no
réné
i
am
for
the
present
sufficiently
convinced
we
will
wait
till
we
can
secure
the
head
of
some
criminal
and
on
the
day
of
the
execution
you
must
arrange
with
the
hangman
réné
bowed
in
token
of
obedience
then
holding
his
candle
up
he
let
the
light
fall
on
the
shelves
where
his
books
stood
climbed
on
a
chair
took
one
down
and
handed
it
to
the
queen
catharine
opened
it
what
is
this
she
asked
the
method
of
raising
and
training
tercels
falcons
and
gerfalcons
to
be
courageous
valiant
and
always
ready
for
flight
ah
pardon
me
madame
i
made
a
mistake
that
is
a
treatise
on
venery
written
by
a
scientific
man
of
lucca
for
the
famous
castruccio
castracani
it
stood
next
the
other
and
was
bound
exactly
like
it
i
took
down
the
wrong
one
however
it
is
a
very
precious
volume
there
are
only
three
copies
extant
one
belongs
to
the
library
at
venice
the
other
was
bought
by
your
grandfather
lorenzo
and
was
offered
by
pietro
de
médicis
to
king
charles
when
he
visited
florence
and
the
third
you
have
in
your
hands
i
venerate
it
said
catharine
because
of
its
rarity
but
as
i
do
not
need
it
i
return
it
to
you
and
she
held
out
her
right
hand
to
réné
to
receive
the
book
which
she
wished
while
with
her
left
hand
she
returned
to
him
the
one
which
she
had
first
taken
this
time
réné
was
not
mistaken
it
was
the
volume
she
wished
he
stepped
down
turned
the
leaves
for
a
moment
and
gave
it
to
her
open
catharine
went
and
sat
down
at
a
table
réné
placed
the
magic
taper
near
her
and
by
the
light
of
its
bluish
flame
she
read
a
few
lines
in
an
undertone
good
said
she
shutting
the
book
that
is
all
i
wanted
to
know
she
rose
from
her
seat
leaving
the
book
on
the
table
but
bearing
away
the
idea
which
had
germinated
in
her
mind
and
would
ripen
there
réné
waited
respectfully
taper
in
hand
until
the
queen
who
seemed
about
to
retire
should
give
him
fresh
orders
or
ask
fresh
questions
catharine
with
her
head
bent
and
her
finger
on
her
mouth
walked
up
and
down
several
times
without
speaking
then
suddenly
stopping
before
réné
and
fixing
on
him
her
eyes
round
and
piercing
like
a
hawk
confess
you
have
made
for
her
some
said
she
for
whom
asked
réné
starting
la
sauve
i
madame
said
réné
never
never
i
swear
it
on
my
soul
there
must
be
some
magic
in
it
however
for
he
is
desperately
in
love
with
her
though
he
is
not
famous
for
his
constancy
who
madame
he
henry
the
accursed
he
who
is
to
succeed
my
three
sons
he
who
shall
one
day
be
called
henry
and
is
yet
the
son
of
jeanne
and
catharine
accompanied
these
words
with
a
sigh
which
made
réné
shudder
for
he
thought
of
the
famous
gloves
he
had
prepared
by
catharine
order
for
the
queen
of
navarre
so
he
still
runs
after
her
does
he
said
réné
he
does
replied
the
queen
i
thought
that
the
king
of
navarre
was
quite
in
love
with
his
wife
now
a
farce
réné
a
farce
i
know
not
why
but
every
one
is
seeking
to
deceive
me
my
daughter
marguerite
is
leagued
against
me
perhaps
she
too
is
looking
forward
to
the
death
of
her
brothers
perhaps
she
too
hopes
to
be
queen
of
france
perhaps
so
réné
falling
back
into
his
own
reverie
and
echoing
catharine
terrible
suspicion
ha
we
shall
see
said
catharine
going
to
the
main
door
for
she
doubtless
judged
it
useless
to
descend
the
secret
stair
now
that
she
was
sure
that
they
were
alone
réné
preceded
her
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
stood
in
the
shop
you
promised
me
some
new
kind
of
cosmetic
for
my
hands
and
lips
réné
the
winter
is
at
hand
and
you
know
how
sensitive
my
skin
is
to
the
cold
i
have
already
provided
for
this
madame
and
i
shall
bring
you
some
you
would
not
find
me
in
before
nine
evening
i
shall
be
occupied
with
my
devotions
during
the
day
i
will
be
at
the
louvre
at
nine
then
madame
madame
de
sauve
has
beautiful
hands
and
beautiful
lips
said
catharine
in
a
careless
tone
what
pomade
does
she
use
for
her
hands
yes
for
her
hands
first
heliotrope
what
for
her
lips
she
is
going
to
try
a
new
opiate
of
my
invention
i
was
going
to
bring
your
majesty
a
box
of
it
at
the
same
time
catharine
mused
an
instant
she
is
certainly
a
very
beautiful
creature
said
she
pursuing
her
secret
thoughts
and
the
passion
of
the
béarnais
for
her
is
not
strange
at
all
and
she
is
so
devoted
to
your
majesty
said
réné
at
least
i
should
think
so
catharine
smiled
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
when
a
woman
loves
is
she
faithful
to
any
one
but
her
lover
you
must
have
given
her
some
philter
réné
i
swear
i
have
not
madame
well
well
we
say
no
more
about
it
show
me
this
new
opiate
you
spoke
of
that
is
to
make
her
lips
fresher
and
rosier
than
ever
réné
approached
a
shelf
and
showed
catharine
six
small
boxes
of
the
same
shape
round
silver
boxes
ranged
side
by
side
this
is
the
only
philter
she
ever
asked
me
for
observed
réné
it
is
true
as
your
majesty
says
i
composed
it
expressly
for
her
for
her
lips
are
so
tender
that
the
sun
and
wind
affect
them
equally
catharine
opened
one
of
the
boxes
it
contained
a
most
fascinating
carmine
paste
give
me
some
paste
for
my
hands
réné
said
she
i
will
take
it
away
with
me
réné
took
the
taper
and
went
to
seek
in
a
private
compartment
what
the
queen
asked
for
as
he
turned
he
fancied
that
he
saw
the
queen
quickly
conceal
a
box
under
her
mantle
he
was
however
too
familiar
with
these
little
thefts
of
the
queen
mother
to
have
the
rudeness
to
seem
to
perceive
the
movement
so
wrapping
the
cosmetic
she
demanded
in
a
paper
bag
ornamented
with
here
it
is
madame
he
said
thanks
réné
returned
the
queen
then
after
a
moment
silence
do
not
give
madame
de
sauve
that
paste
for
a
week
or
ten
days
i
wish
to
make
the
first
trial
of
it
myself
and
she
prepared
to
go
your
majesty
do
you
desire
me
to
accompany
you
asked
réné
only
to
the
end
of
the
bridge
replied
catharine
my
gentlemen
and
my
litter
wait
for
me
there
they
left
the
house
and
at
the
end
of
the
rue
de
la
barillerie
four
gentlemen
on
horseback
and
a
plain
litter
were
waiting
on
his
return
réné
first
care
was
to
count
his
boxes
of
opiates
one
was
wanting
chapter
xxi
madame
de
sauve
apartment
catharine
was
not
deceived
in
her
suspicions
henry
had
resumed
his
former
habits
and
went
every
evening
to
madame
de
sauve
at
first
he
accomplished
this
with
the
greatest
secrecy
but
gradually
he
grew
negligent
and
ceased
to
take
any
precautions
so
that
catharine
had
no
trouble
in
finding
out
that
while
marguerite
was
still
nominally
queen
of
navarre
madame
de
sauve
was
the
real
queen
at
the
beginning
of
this
story
we
said
a
word
or
two
about
madame
de
sauve
apartment
but
the
door
opened
by
dariole
to
the
king
of
navarre
closed
hermetically
behind
him
so
that
these
rooms
the
scene
of
the
béarnais
mysterious
amours
are
totally
unknown
to
us
the
quarters
like
those
furnished
by
princes
for
their
dependents
in
the
palaces
occupied
by
them
in
order
to
have
them
within
reach
were
smaller
and
less
convenient
than
what
she
could
have
found
in
the
city
itself
as
the
reader
already
knows
they
were
situated
on
the
second
floor
of
the
palace
almost
immediately
above
those
occupied
by
henry
himself
the
door
opened
into
a
corridor
the
end
of
which
was
lighted
by
an
arched
window
with
small
leaded
panes
so
that
even
in
the
loveliest
days
of
the
year
only
a
dubious
light
filtered
through
during
the
winter
after
three
in
the
afternoon
it
was
necessary
to
light
a
lamp
but
as
this
contained
no
more
oil
than
in
summer
it
went
out
by
ten
and
thus
as
soon
as
the
winter
days
arrived
gave
the
two
lovers
the
greatest
security
a
small
antechamber
carpeted
with
yellow
flowered
damask
a
with
hangings
of
blue
velvet
a
the
bed
adorned
with
twisted
columns
and
curtains
enshrining
a
ornamented
with
a
set
in
silver
and
two
paintings
representing
the
loves
of
venus
and
adonis
such
was
the
residence
or
as
one
would
say
nowadays
the
nest
of
the
lovely
to
queen
catharine
de
médicis
if
one
had
looked
sharply
one
would
have
found
opposite
a
provided
with
every
accessory
a
small
door
in
a
dark
corner
of
this
room
opening
into
a
sort
of
oratory
where
raised
on
two
steps
stood
a
in
this
little
chapel
on
the
wall
hung
three
or
four
paintings
to
the
highest
degree
spiritual
as
if
to
serve
as
a
corrective
to
the
two
mythological
pictures
which
we
mentioned
among
these
paintings
were
hung
on
gilded
nails
weapons
such
as
women
carried
that
evening
which
was
the
one
following
the
scenes
which
we
have
described
as
taking
place
at
maître
réné
madame
de
sauve
seated
in
her
bedroom
on
a
couch
was
telling
henry
about
her
fears
and
her
love
and
was
giving
him
as
a
proof
of
her
love
the
devotion
which
she
had
shown
on
the
famous
night
following
saint
bartholomew
the
night
which
it
will
be
remembered
henry
spent
in
his
wife
quarters
henry
on
his
side
was
expressing
his
gratitude
to
her
madame
de
sauve
was
charming
that
evening
in
her
simple
batiste
wrapper
and
henry
was
very
grateful
at
the
same
time
as
henry
was
really
in
love
he
was
dreamy
madame
de
sauve
who
had
come
actually
to
love
instead
of
pretending
to
love
as
catharine
had
commanded
kept
gazing
at
henry
to
see
if
his
eyes
were
in
accord
with
his
words
come
now
henry
she
was
saying
be
honest
that
night
which
you
spent
in
the
boudoir
of
her
majesty
the
queen
of
navarre
with
monsieur
de
la
mole
at
your
feet
did
you
feel
sorry
that
that
worthy
gentleman
was
between
you
and
the
queen
bedroom
certainly
i
did
sweetheart
said
henry
for
the
only
way
that
i
could
reach
this
room
where
i
am
so
comfortable
where
at
this
instant
i
am
so
happy
was
for
me
to
pass
through
the
queen
room
madame
de
sauve
smiled
and
you
have
not
been
there
since
only
as
i
have
told
you
you
will
never
go
to
her
without
informing
me
never
would
you
swear
to
it
certainly
i
would
if
i
were
still
a
huguenot
but
but
what
but
the
catholic
religion
the
dogmas
of
which
i
am
now
learning
teach
me
that
one
must
never
take
an
oath
gascon
exclaimed
madame
de
sauve
shaking
her
head
but
now
it
is
my
turn
charlotte
said
henry
if
i
ask
you
some
questions
will
you
answer
certainly
i
will
replied
the
young
woman
i
have
nothing
to
hide
from
you
now
look
here
charlotte
said
the
king
explain
to
me
just
for
once
how
it
came
about
that
after
the
desperate
resistance
which
you
made
to
me
before
my
marriage
you
became
less
cruel
to
me
who
am
an
awkward
béarnais
an
absurd
provincial
a
prince
too
indeed
to
keep
the
jewels
of
his
crown
polished
henry
said
charlotte
you
are
asking
the
explanation
of
the
enigma
which
the
philosophers
of
all
countries
have
been
trying
to
determine
for
the
past
three
thousand
years
henry
never
ask
a
woman
why
she
loves
you
be
satisfied
with
asking
you
love
me
do
you
love
me
charlotte
asked
henry
i
love
you
replied
madame
de
sauve
with
a
fascinating
smile
dropping
her
pretty
hand
into
her
lover
henry
retained
the
hand
but
he
went
on
to
say
following
out
his
thought
supposing
i
have
guessed
the
word
which
the
philosophers
have
been
vainly
trying
to
find
for
three
thousand
years
at
least
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
charlotte
madame
de
sauve
blushed
you
love
me
pursued
henry
consequently
i
have
nothing
else
to
ask
you
and
i
consider
myself
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
but
you
know
happiness
is
always
accompanied
by
some
lack
adam
in
the
midst
of
eden
was
not
perfectly
happy
and
he
bit
into
that
miserable
apple
which
imposed
upon
us
all
that
love
for
novelty
that
makes
every
one
spend
his
life
in
the
search
for
something
unknown
tell
me
my
darling
in
order
to
help
me
to
find
mine
did
queen
catharine
at
first
bid
you
love
me
henry
exclaimed
madame
de
sauve
speak
lower
when
you
speak
of
the
queen
mother
oh
exclaimed
henry
with
a
spontaneity
and
boldness
which
deceived
madame
de
sauve
herself
it
was
a
good
thing
formerly
to
distrust
her
kind
mother
that
she
is
but
then
we
were
not
on
good
terms
but
now
that
i
am
her
daughter
husband
madame
marguerite
husband
exclaimed
charlotte
flushing
with
jealousy
speak
low
in
your
turn
said
henry
now
that
i
am
her
husband
we
are
the
best
friends
in
the
world
what
was
it
they
wanted
for
me
to
become
a
catholic
so
it
seems
well
grace
has
touched
me
and
by
the
intercession
of
saint
bartholomew
i
have
become
one
we
live
together
like
brethren
in
a
happy
family
like
good
christians
and
queen
marguerite
queen
marguerite
repeated
henry
oh
well
she
is
the
link
uniting
us
but
henry
you
said
that
the
queen
of
navarre
as
a
reward
for
the
devotion
i
showed
her
had
been
generous
to
me
if
what
you
say
is
true
if
this
generosity
for
which
i
have
cherished
deep
gratitude
toward
her
is
genuine
she
is
a
connecting
link
easy
to
break
so
you
can
not
trust
to
this
support
for
you
have
not
made
your
pretended
intimacy
impose
on
any
one
still
i
do
rest
on
it
and
for
three
months
it
has
been
the
bolster
on
which
i
have
slept
then
henry
cried
madame
de
sauve
you
have
deceived
me
and
madame
marguerite
is
really
your
wife
henry
smiled
there
henry
said
madame
de
sauve
you
have
given
me
one
of
those
exasperating
smiles
which
make
me
feel
the
cruel
desire
to
scratch
your
eyes
out
king
though
you
are
then
said
henry
i
seem
to
be
imposing
now
by
means
of
this
pretended
friendship
since
there
are
moments
when
king
though
i
am
you
desire
to
scratch
out
my
eyes
because
you
believe
that
it
exists
henry
henry
said
madame
de
sauve
i
believe
that
god
himself
does
not
know
what
your
thoughts
are
my
sweetheart
said
henry
i
think
that
catharine
first
told
you
to
love
me
next
that
your
heart
told
you
the
same
thing
and
that
when
those
two
voices
are
speaking
to
you
you
hear
only
your
heart
now
here
i
am
i
love
you
and
love
you
with
my
whole
heart
and
that
is
the
very
reason
why
if
ever
i
should
have
secrets
i
should
not
confide
them
to
you
for
fear
of
compromising
you
of
course
for
the
friendship
is
changeable
it
is
a
this
was
not
what
charlotte
expected
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
thickening
veil
between
her
and
her
lover
every
time
she
tried
to
sound
the
depths
of
his
bottomless
heart
was
assuming
the
consistency
of
a
wall
and
was
separating
them
from
each
other
so
she
felt
the
tears
springing
to
her
eyes
as
he
made
this
answer
and
as
it
struck
ten
just
at
that
moment
sire
said
charlotte
it
is
my
my
duties
call
me
very
early
morning
to
the
queen
mother
so
you
drive
me
away
do
you
sweetheart
henry
i
am
sad
as
i
am
sad
you
would
find
me
tedious
and
you
would
not
like
me
any
more
you
see
that
it
is
better
for
you
to
withdraw
very
good
said
henry
i
will
withdraw
if
you
insist
upon
it
only
saint
you
must
at
least
grant
me
the
favor
of
staying
for
your
toilet
but
queen
marguerite
sire
wo
you
keep
her
waiting
if
you
remain
charlotte
replied
henry
gravely
it
was
agreed
between
us
that
we
should
never
mention
the
queen
of
navarre
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
evening
we
have
talked
about
nothing
but
her
madame
de
sauve
sighed
then
she
went
and
sat
down
before
her
henry
took
a
chair
pulled
it
along
toward
the
one
that
served
as
his
mistress
seat
and
setting
one
knee
on
it
while
he
leaned
on
the
back
of
the
other
he
said
come
my
good
little
charlotte
let
me
see
you
make
yourself
beautiful
and
beautiful
for
me
whatever
you
said
heavens
what
things
what
what
powders
what
phials
what
perfumery
boxes
it
seems
a
good
deal
said
charlotte
with
a
sigh
and
yet
it
is
too
little
since
with
it
all
i
have
not
as
yet
found
the
means
of
reigning
exclusively
over
your
majesty
heart
there
exclaimed
henry
let
us
not
fall
back
on
politics
what
is
that
little
fine
delicate
brush
should
it
not
be
for
painting
the
eyebrows
of
my
olympian
jupiter
yes
sire
replied
madame
de
sauve
and
you
have
guessed
at
the
first
shot
and
that
pretty
little
ivory
rake
is
for
parting
the
hair
and
that
charming
little
silver
box
with
a
chased
cover
oh
that
is
something
réné
sent
sire
is
the
famous
opiate
which
he
has
been
promising
me
so
long
to
make
still
sweeter
the
lips
which
your
majesty
has
been
good
enough
sometimes
to
find
rather
sweet
and
henry
as
if
to
test
what
the
charming
woman
said
touched
his
lips
to
the
ones
which
she
was
looking
at
so
attentively
in
the
mirror
now
that
they
were
returning
to
the
field
of
coquetry
the
cloud
began
to
lift
from
the
baroness
brow
she
took
up
the
box
which
had
thus
been
explained
and
was
just
going
to
show
henry
how
the
vermilion
salve
was
used
when
a
sharp
rap
at
the
antechamber
door
startled
the
two
lovers
some
one
is
knocking
madame
said
dariole
thrusting
her
head
through
the
opening
of
the
portière
go
and
find
out
who
it
is
and
come
back
said
madame
de
sauve
henry
and
charlotte
looked
at
each
other
anxiously
and
henry
was
beginning
to
think
of
retiring
to
the
oratory
in
which
he
had
already
more
than
once
taken
refuge
when
dariole
reappeared
madame
said
she
it
is
maître
réné
the
perfumer
at
this
name
henry
frowned
and
involuntarily
bit
his
lips
do
you
want
me
to
refuse
him
admission
asked
charlotte
no
said
henry
maître
réné
never
does
anything
without
having
previously
thought
about
it
if
he
comes
to
you
it
is
because
he
has
a
reason
for
coming
in
that
case
do
you
wish
to
hide
i
shall
be
careful
not
to
said
henry
for
maître
réné
knows
everything
therefore
maître
réné
knows
that
i
am
here
but
has
not
your
majesty
some
reason
for
thinking
his
presence
painful
to
you
i
said
henry
making
an
effort
which
in
spite
of
his
he
could
not
wholly
dissimulate
i
none
at
all
we
are
rather
cool
to
each
other
it
is
true
but
since
the
night
of
saint
bartholomew
we
have
been
reconciled
let
him
enter
said
madame
de
sauve
to
dariole
a
moment
later
réné
appeared
and
took
in
the
whole
room
at
a
glance
madame
de
sauve
was
still
before
her
henry
had
resumed
his
place
on
the
couch
charlotte
was
in
the
light
and
henry
in
the
shadow
madame
said
réné
with
respectful
familiarity
i
have
come
to
offer
my
apologies
for
what
réné
asked
madame
de
sauve
with
that
condescension
which
pretty
women
always
use
towards
the
world
of
tradespeople
who
surround
them
and
whose
duty
it
is
to
make
them
more
beautiful
because
long
ago
i
promised
to
work
for
these
pretty
lips
and
because
because
you
did
not
keep
your
promise
until
is
that
it
asked
charlotte
until
repeated
réné
yes
it
was
only
in
fact
this
evening
that
i
received
the
box
you
sent
me
ah
indeed
said
réné
looking
strangely
at
the
small
opiate
box
on
madame
de
sauve
table
which
was
precisely
like
those
he
had
in
his
shop
i
thought
so
he
murmured
and
you
have
used
it
no
not
yet
i
was
just
about
to
try
it
as
you
entered
réné
face
assumed
a
dreamy
expression
which
did
not
escape
henry
indeed
very
few
things
escaped
him
well
réné
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
asked
the
king
i
nothing
sire
said
the
perfumer
i
am
humbly
waiting
until
your
majesty
speaks
to
me
before
taking
leave
of
madame
la
baronne
come
now
said
henry
smiling
do
you
need
my
word
to
know
that
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
see
you
réné
glanced
around
him
made
a
tour
of
the
room
as
if
to
sound
the
doors
and
the
curtains
with
his
eye
and
ear
then
he
stopped
and
standing
so
that
he
could
embrace
at
a
glance
both
madame
de
sauve
and
henry
i
do
not
know
it
said
he
thanks
to
that
admirable
instinct
which
like
a
sixth
sense
guided
him
during
the
first
part
of
his
life
in
the
midst
of
impending
dangers
henry
felt
that
at
that
moment
something
strangely
resembling
a
struggle
was
passing
through
the
mind
of
the
perfumer
and
turned
towards
him
still
in
the
shadow
while
the
florentine
face
was
in
the
light
you
here
at
this
hour
réné
said
he
am
i
unfortunate
enough
to
be
in
your
majesty
way
asked
the
perfumer
stepping
back
no
but
i
want
to
know
one
thing
what
sire
did
you
think
you
would
find
me
here
i
was
sure
of
it
you
wanted
me
then
i
am
glad
to
have
found
you
at
least
have
you
something
to
say
to
me
persisted
henry
perhaps
sire
replied
réné
charlotte
blushed
for
she
feared
that
the
revelation
which
the
perfumer
seemed
anxious
to
make
might
have
something
to
do
with
her
conduct
towards
henry
therefore
she
acted
as
though
having
been
wholly
engrossed
with
her
toilet
she
had
heard
nothing
and
interrupted
the
conversation
ah
really
réné
said
she
opening
the
opiate
box
you
are
a
delightful
man
this
cake
is
a
marvellous
color
and
since
you
are
here
i
am
going
to
honor
you
by
experimenting
with
your
new
production
she
took
the
box
in
one
hand
and
with
the
other
touched
the
tip
of
her
finger
to
the
rose
paste
which
she
was
about
to
raise
to
her
lips
réné
gave
a
start
the
baroness
smilingly
lifted
the
opiate
to
her
mouth
réné
turned
pale
still
in
the
shadow
but
with
fixed
and
glowing
eyes
henry
lost
neither
the
action
of
the
one
nor
the
shudder
of
the
other
charlotte
hand
had
but
a
short
distance
to
go
before
it
would
touch
her
lips
when
réné
seized
her
arm
just
as
henry
rose
to
do
so
henry
fell
back
noiselessly
on
the
couch
one
moment
madame
said
réné
with
a
constrained
smile
you
must
not
use
this
opiate
without
special
directions
who
will
give
me
these
directions
i
when
as
soon
as
i
have
finished
saying
what
i
have
to
say
to
his
majesty
the
king
of
navarre
charlotte
opened
her
eyes
wide
understanding
nothing
of
the
mysterious
language
about
her
and
sat
with
the
opiate
pot
in
one
hand
gazing
at
the
tip
of
her
finger
red
with
the
rouge
henry
rose
and
moved
by
a
thought
which
like
all
those
of
the
young
king
had
two
sides
one
which
seemed
superficial
the
other
which
was
deep
he
took
charlotte
hand
and
red
as
it
was
made
as
though
to
raise
it
to
his
lips
one
moment
said
réné
quickly
one
moment
be
kind
enough
madame
to
rinse
your
lovely
hands
with
this
soap
from
naples
which
i
neglected
to
send
you
at
the
same
time
as
the
rouge
and
which
i
have
the
honor
of
bringing
you
now
drawing
from
its
silver
wrapping
a
cake
of
green
soap
he
put
it
in
a
vermilion
basin
poured
some
water
over
it
and
with
one
knee
on
the
floor
offered
it
to
madame
de
sauve
why
really
maître
réné
i
no
longer
recognize
you
said
henry
you
are
so
gallant
that
you
far
outstrip
every
court
fop
oh
what
a
delicious
perfume
cried
charlotte
rubbing
her
beautiful
hands
with
the
pearly
foam
made
by
the
scented
cake
réné
performed
his
office
of
courtier
to
the
end
he
offered
a
napkin
of
fine
frisian
linen
to
madame
de
sauve
who
dried
her
hands
on
it
now
said
the
florentine
to
henry
let
your
mind
be
at
rest
monseigneur
charlotte
gave
her
hand
to
henry
who
kissed
it
and
while
she
half
turned
on
her
chair
to
listen
to
what
réné
was
about
to
say
the
king
of
navarre
returned
to
his
couch
more
convinced
than
ever
that
something
unusual
was
passing
through
the
mind
of
the
perfumer
well
asked
charlotte
the
florentine
apparently
made
an
effort
to
collect
all
his
strength
and
then
turned
towards
henry
chapter
xxii
sire
you
shall
be
king
sire
said
réné
to
henry
i
have
come
to
speak
of
something
which
has
been
on
my
mind
for
some
time
perfumery
said
henry
smiling
well
yes
sire
perfumery
replied
réné
with
a
singular
nod
of
acquiescence
speak
i
am
listening
to
you
this
is
a
subject
which
has
always
interested
me
deeply
réné
looked
at
henry
to
try
in
spite
of
his
words
to
read
the
impenetrable
thought
but
seeing
that
it
was
perfectly
impossible
he
continued
one
of
my
friends
sire
has
just
arrived
from
florence
this
friend
is
greatly
interested
in
astrology
yes
interrupted
henry
i
know
that
it
is
a
passion
with
florentines
in
company
with
the
foremost
students
of
the
world
he
has
read
the
horoscopes
of
the
chief
gentlemen
of
europe
ah
ah
exclaimed
henry
and
as
the
house
of
bourbon
is
at
the
head
of
the
highest
descended
as
it
is
from
the
count
of
clermont
the
fifth
son
of
saint
louis
your
majesty
must
know
that
your
horoscope
has
not
been
overlooked
henry
listened
still
more
attentively
do
you
remember
this
horoscope
said
the
king
of
navarre
with
a
smile
which
he
strove
to
render
indifferent
oh
replied
réné
shaking
his
head
your
horoscope
is
not
one
to
be
forgotten
indeed
said
henry
ironically
yes
sire
according
to
this
horoscope
your
majesty
is
to
have
a
most
brilliant
destiny
the
young
prince
gave
a
lightning
glance
which
was
almost
at
once
lost
under
cover
of
indifference
every
italian
oracle
is
apt
to
flatter
said
henry
but
he
who
flatters
lies
are
there
not
those
who
have
predicted
that
i
would
command
armies
i
he
burst
out
laughing
but
an
observer
less
occupied
with
himself
than
réné
would
have
noticed
and
realized
the
effort
of
this
laugh
sire
said
réné
coldly
the
horoscope
tells
better
than
that
does
it
foretell
that
at
the
head
of
one
of
these
armies
i
shall
win
battles
better
than
that
sire
well
said
henry
you
will
see
that
i
shall
be
conqueror
sire
you
shall
be
king
well
saint
exclaimed
henry
repressing
a
violent
beating
of
his
heart
am
i
not
that
already
sire
my
friend
knows
what
he
promises
not
only
will
you
be
king
but
you
will
reign
in
that
case
said
henry
in
the
same
mocking
tone
your
friend
must
have
ten
crowns
of
gold
must
he
not
réné
for
such
a
prophecy
is
very
ambitious
especially
in
times
like
these
well
réné
as
i
am
not
rich
i
will
give
your
friend
five
now
and
five
more
when
the
prophecy
is
fulfilled
sire
said
madame
de
sauve
do
not
forget
that
you
are
already
pledged
to
dariole
and
do
not
overburden
yourself
with
promises
madame
said
henry
i
hope
when
this
time
comes
that
i
shall
be
treated
as
a
king
and
that
they
will
be
satisfied
if
i
keep
half
of
my
promises
sire
said
réné
i
will
continue
oh
that
is
not
all
then
said
henry
well
if
i
am
emperor
i
will
give
twice
as
much
sire
my
friend
has
returned
from
florence
with
the
horoscope
which
he
renewed
in
paris
and
which
always
gives
the
same
result
and
he
told
me
a
secret
a
secret
of
interest
to
his
majesty
asked
charlotte
quickly
i
think
so
said
the
florentine
he
is
searching
for
words
thought
henry
without
in
any
way
coming
to
réné
rescue
apparently
the
thing
is
difficult
to
tell
speak
then
went
on
the
baroness
de
sauve
what
is
it
about
it
is
about
all
the
rumors
of
poisoning
said
the
florentine
weighing
each
of
his
words
separately
it
is
about
all
the
rumors
of
poisoning
which
for
some
time
have
been
circulated
around
court
a
slight
movement
of
the
nostrils
of
the
king
of
navarre
was
the
only
indication
of
his
increased
attention
at
the
sudden
turn
in
the
conversation
and
your
friend
the
florentine
said
henry
knows
something
about
this
poisoning
yes
sire
how
can
you
tell
me
a
secret
which
is
not
yours
réné
especially
when
the
secret
is
such
an
important
one
said
henry
in
the
most
natural
tone
he
could
assume
this
friend
has
some
advice
to
ask
of
your
majesty
of
me
what
is
there
surprising
in
that
sire
remember
the
old
soldier
of
actium
who
having
a
on
hand
asked
advice
of
augustus
augustus
was
a
lawyer
réné
and
i
am
not
sire
when
my
friend
confided
this
secret
to
me
your
majesty
still
belonged
to
the
calvinist
party
of
which
you
were
the
chief
head
and
of
which
monsieur
de
condé
was
the
second
well
said
henry
this
friend
hoped
that
you
would
use
your
influence
over
monsieur
de
condé
and
beg
him
not
to
be
hostile
to
him
explain
this
to
me
réné
if
you
wish
me
to
understand
it
said
henry
without
betraying
the
least
change
in
his
face
or
voice
sire
your
majesty
will
understand
at
the
first
word
this
friend
knows
all
the
particulars
of
the
attempt
to
poison
monseigneur
de
condé
there
has
been
an
attempt
to
poison
the
prince
de
condé
exclaimed
henry
with
a
astonishment
ah
indeed
and
when
was
this
réné
looked
fixedly
at
the
king
and
replied
merely
by
these
words
a
week
ago
your
majesty
some
enemy
asked
the
king
yes
replied
réné
an
enemy
whom
your
majesty
knows
and
who
knows
your
majesty
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
henry
i
think
i
have
heard
this
mentioned
but
i
am
ignorant
of
the
details
which
your
friend
has
to
reveal
tell
them
to
me
well
a
perfumed
apple
was
offered
to
the
prince
of
condé
fortunately
however
when
it
was
brought
to
him
his
physician
was
with
him
he
took
it
from
the
hands
of
the
messenger
and
smelled
it
to
test
its
odor
and
soundness
two
days
later
a
gangrene
swelling
of
the
face
an
extravasation
of
the
blood
a
running
sore
which
ate
away
his
face
were
the
price
of
his
devotion
or
the
result
of
his
imprudence
unfortunately
replied
henry
being
half
catholic
already
i
have
lost
all
influence
over
monsieur
de
condé
your
friend
was
wrong
therefore
in
addressing
himself
to
me
it
was
not
only
in
regard
to
the
prince
de
condé
that
your
majesty
could
be
of
use
to
my
friend
but
in
regard
to
the
prince
de
porcian
also
the
brother
of
the
one
who
was
poisoned
ah
exclaimed
charlotte
do
you
know
réné
that
your
stories
partake
of
the
gruesome
you
plead
at
a
poor
time
it
is
late
your
conversation
is
really
your
perfumes
are
worth
more
charlotte
again
extended
her
hand
towards
the
opiate
box
madame
said
réné
before
testing
that
as
you
are
about
to
do
hear
what
cruel
results
wicked
men
can
draw
from
it
really
réné
said
the
baroness
you
are
funereal
this
evening
henry
frowned
but
he
understood
that
réné
wished
to
reach
a
goal
which
he
did
not
yet
see
and
he
resolved
to
push
towards
this
end
the
conversation
which
awakened
in
him
such
painful
memories
and
he
continued
you
knew
the
details
of
the
poisoning
of
the
prince
de
porcian
yes
said
he
it
is
known
that
every
night
he
left
a
lamp
burning
near
his
bed
the
oil
was
poisoned
and
he
was
asphyxiated
henry
clinched
his
fingers
which
were
damp
with
perspiration
so
he
murmured
he
whom
you
call
your
friend
knows
not
only
the
details
of
the
poisoning
but
the
author
of
it
yes
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
he
wished
to
ask
you
if
you
would
use
over
the
prince
of
porcian
the
remains
of
that
influence
and
have
the
murderer
pardoned
for
the
death
of
his
brother
unfortunately
replied
henry
still
being
half
huguenot
i
have
no
influence
over
monsieur
le
prince
de
porcian
your
friend
therefore
would
have
done
wrong
in
speaking
to
me
but
what
do
you
think
of
the
intentions
of
monsieur
le
prince
de
condé
and
of
monsieur
de
porcian
how
should
i
know
their
intentions
réné
god
whom
i
may
know
has
not
given
me
the
privilege
of
reading
their
hearts
your
majesty
must
ask
yourself
said
the
florentine
calmly
is
there
not
in
the
life
of
your
majesty
some
event
so
gloomy
that
it
can
serve
as
a
test
of
clemency
so
painful
that
it
is
a
touchstone
for
generosity
these
words
were
uttered
in
a
tone
which
made
charlotte
herself
tremble
it
was
an
allusion
so
direct
so
pointed
that
the
young
woman
turned
aside
to
hide
her
blush
and
to
avoid
meeting
henry
eyes
henry
made
a
supreme
effort
over
himself
his
forehead
which
during
the
words
of
the
florentine
wore
threatening
lines
unbent
and
he
changed
the
dignified
filial
grief
which
tightened
his
heart
into
vague
meditation
in
my
life
said
he
a
gloomy
circumstance
no
réné
no
i
remember
in
my
youth
only
folly
and
carelessness
mingled
with
more
or
less
cruel
necessity
imposed
on
every
one
by
the
demands
of
nature
and
the
proofs
of
god
réné
in
turn
became
constrained
as
he
glanced
from
henry
to
charlotte
as
though
to
rouse
the
one
and
hold
back
the
other
for
charlotte
had
returned
to
her
toilet
to
hide
the
anxiety
caused
by
their
conversation
and
had
again
extended
her
hand
towards
the
opiate
box
but
sire
if
you
were
the
brother
of
the
prince
of
porcian
or
the
son
of
the
prince
of
condé
and
if
they
had
poisoned
your
brother
or
assassinated
your
father
charlotte
uttered
a
slight
cry
and
raised
the
opiate
to
her
lips
réné
saw
the
gesture
but
this
time
he
stopped
her
neither
by
word
nor
gesture
he
merely
exclaimed
in
heaven
name
sire
answer
sire
if
you
were
in
their
place
what
would
you
do
henry
recovered
himself
with
trembling
hand
he
wiped
his
forehead
on
which
stood
drops
of
cold
perspiration
and
rising
to
his
full
height
replied
in
the
midst
of
the
silence
which
until
then
had
held
réné
and
charlotte
if
i
were
in
their
place
and
if
i
were
sure
of
being
king
that
is
sure
of
representing
god
on
earth
i
would
act
like
god
i
should
pardon
madame
cried
réné
snatching
the
opiate
from
the
hands
of
madame
de
sauve
madame
give
me
back
this
box
my
messenger
boy
i
see
has
made
a
mistake
in
it
i
will
send
you
another
chapter
xxiii
a
new
convert
the
following
day
there
was
to
be
a
hunt
in
the
forest
of
saint
germain
henry
had
ordered
a
small
béarnais
horse
to
be
made
ready
for
him
that
is
to
be
saddled
and
bridled
at
eight
in
the
morning
he
had
intended
giving
this
horse
to
madame
de
sauve
but
he
wanted
to
try
it
first
at
a
quarter
before
eight
the
horse
was
ready
on
the
stroke
of
eight
henry
came
down
to
the
the
horse
proud
and
fiery
in
spite
of
its
small
size
pricked
up
its
ears
and
pawed
the
ground
the
weather
was
cold
and
a
light
frost
covered
the
pavement
henry
started
to
cross
the
to
the
stables
where
the
horse
and
the
groom
were
waiting
when
a
swiss
soldier
whom
he
passed
standing
sentinel
at
the
gate
presented
arms
and
said
god
keep
his
majesty
the
king
of
navarre
at
this
wish
and
especially
at
the
tone
in
which
it
was
uttered
the
béarnais
started
he
turned
and
stepped
back
de
mouy
he
murmured
yes
sire
de
mouy
what
are
you
doing
here
looking
for
you
why
are
you
looking
for
me
i
must
speak
to
your
majesty
unfortunately
said
the
king
approaching
him
do
you
not
know
you
risk
your
head
i
know
it
well
well
i
am
here
henry
turned
slightly
pale
for
he
knew
that
he
shared
the
danger
run
by
this
rash
young
man
he
looked
anxiously
about
him
and
stepped
back
a
second
time
no
less
quickly
than
he
had
done
at
first
he
had
seen
the
duc
at
a
window
at
once
changing
his
manner
henry
took
the
musket
from
the
hands
of
de
mouy
standing
as
we
have
said
sentinel
and
while
apparently
measuring
it
de
mouy
said
he
it
is
certainly
not
without
some
very
strong
motive
that
you
have
come
to
beard
the
lion
in
his
den
in
this
way
no
sire
i
have
waited
for
you
a
week
only
yesterday
i
heard
that
your
majesty
was
to
try
a
horse
this
morning
and
i
took
my
position
at
the
gate
of
the
louvre
but
how
in
this
uniform
the
captain
of
the
company
is
a
protestant
and
is
one
of
my
friends
here
is
your
musket
return
to
your
duty
of
sentinel
we
are
watched
as
i
come
back
i
will
try
to
say
a
word
to
you
but
if
i
do
not
speak
do
not
stop
me
adieu
de
mouy
resumed
his
measured
walk
and
henry
advanced
towards
the
house
what
is
that
pretty
little
animal
asked
the
duc
from
his
window
a
horse
i
am
going
to
try
this
morning
replied
henry
but
that
is
not
a
horse
for
a
man
therefore
it
is
intended
for
a
beautiful
woman
take
care
henry
you
are
going
to
be
indiscreet
for
we
shall
see
this
beautiful
woman
at
the
hunt
and
if
i
do
not
know
whose
knight
you
are
i
shall
at
least
know
whose
equerry
you
are
no
my
lord
you
will
not
know
said
henry
with
his
feigned
for
this
beautiful
woman
can
not
go
out
this
morning
she
is
indisposed
he
sprang
into
the
saddle
ah
bah
cried
laughing
poor
madame
de
sauve
françois
françois
it
is
you
who
are
indiscreet
what
is
the
matter
with
the
beautiful
charlotte
went
on
the
duc
why
replied
henry
spurring
his
horse
to
a
gallop
and
making
him
describe
a
graceful
curve
why
i
have
no
idea
a
heaviness
in
the
head
according
to
what
dariole
tells
me
a
torpor
of
the
whole
body
in
short
general
debility
and
will
this
prevent
you
from
joining
us
asked
the
duke
i
why
should
it
asked
henry
you
know
that
i
dote
on
a
hunt
and
that
nothing
could
make
me
miss
one
but
you
will
miss
this
one
henry
said
the
duke
after
he
had
turned
and
spoken
for
an
instant
with
some
one
unnoticed
by
henry
who
addressed
françois
from
the
rear
of
the
room
for
his
majesty
tells
me
that
the
hunt
can
not
take
place
bah
said
henry
in
the
most
disappointed
tone
imaginable
why
not
very
important
letters
from
monsieur
de
nevers
it
seems
there
is
a
council
among
the
king
the
queen
mother
and
my
brother
the
duc
ah
ah
said
henry
to
himself
could
any
news
have
come
from
poland
then
aloud
in
that
case
he
continued
it
is
useless
for
me
to
run
any
further
risk
on
this
frost
brother
pulling
up
his
horse
in
front
of
de
mouy
my
friend
said
he
call
one
of
your
comrades
to
finish
your
sentinel
duty
for
you
help
the
groom
ungirth
my
horse
put
the
saddle
over
your
head
and
carry
it
to
the
saddler
there
is
some
embroidery
to
be
done
on
it
which
there
was
not
time
to
finish
for
you
will
bring
an
answer
to
my
apartments
de
mouy
hastened
to
obey
for
the
duc
had
disappeared
from
his
window
and
it
was
evident
that
he
suspected
something
in
fact
scarcely
had
de
mouy
disappeared
through
the
gate
before
the
duc
came
in
sight
a
real
swiss
was
in
de
mouy
place
looked
carefully
at
the
new
sentinel
then
turning
to
henry
this
is
not
the
man
you
were
talking
with
just
now
is
it
brother
the
other
is
a
young
man
who
belongs
to
my
household
and
whom
i
had
enter
the
swiss
guards
i
have
just
given
him
a
commission
and
he
has
gone
to
carry
it
out
ah
said
the
duke
as
if
this
reply
sufficed
and
how
is
marguerite
i
am
going
to
ask
her
brother
have
you
not
seen
her
since
yesterday
no
i
went
to
her
about
eleven
last
night
but
gillonne
told
me
that
she
was
tired
and
had
gone
to
sleep
you
will
not
find
her
in
her
room
she
has
gone
out
oh
said
henry
very
likely
she
was
to
go
to
the
de
there
was
no
way
of
carrying
the
conversation
further
as
henry
had
seemingly
made
up
his
mind
simply
to
answer
the
two
therefore
departed
the
duc
to
go
for
news
he
said
the
king
of
navarre
to
return
to
his
room
henry
had
been
there
scarcely
five
minutes
when
he
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
who
is
it
he
asked
sire
replied
a
voice
which
henry
recognized
as
that
of
de
mouy
it
is
the
answer
from
the
saddler
henry
visibly
moved
bade
the
young
man
enter
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
is
it
you
de
mouy
said
he
i
hoped
that
you
would
reflect
sire
replied
de
mouy
i
have
reflected
for
three
months
that
is
long
enough
now
it
is
time
to
act
henry
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
fear
nothing
sire
we
are
alone
and
i
will
make
haste
for
time
is
precious
your
majesty
can
tell
in
a
word
all
that
the
events
of
the
year
have
lost
to
the
cause
of
religion
let
us
be
clear
brief
and
frank
i
am
listening
my
good
de
mouy
replied
henry
seeing
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
elude
the
explanation
is
it
true
that
your
majesty
has
abjured
the
protestant
religion
it
is
true
said
henry
yes
but
is
it
with
your
lips
or
at
heart
one
is
always
grateful
to
god
when
he
saves
our
life
replied
henry
turning
the
question
as
he
had
a
habit
of
doing
in
such
cases
and
god
has
evidently
saved
me
from
this
cruel
danger
sire
resumed
de
mouy
let
us
admit
one
thing
what
that
your
abjuring
is
not
a
matter
of
conviction
but
of
calculation
you
have
abjured
so
that
the
king
would
let
you
live
and
not
because
god
has
saved
your
life
whatever
the
cause
of
my
conversion
de
mouy
replied
henry
i
am
none
the
less
a
catholic
yes
but
shall
you
always
be
one
the
first
chance
you
have
for
resuming
your
freedom
of
life
and
of
conscience
will
you
not
resume
it
well
this
opportunity
has
presented
itself
la
rochelle
has
revolted
roussillon
and
béarn
are
merely
waiting
for
one
word
before
acting
in
guyenne
every
one
cries
for
war
merely
tell
me
if
you
were
forced
into
taking
this
step
and
i
will
answer
for
the
future
a
gentleman
of
my
birth
is
not
forced
my
dear
de
mouy
that
which
i
have
done
i
have
done
voluntarily
but
sire
said
the
young
man
his
heart
oppressed
with
this
resistance
which
he
had
not
expected
you
do
not
remember
that
in
acting
thus
you
abandon
and
betray
us
henry
was
unmoved
yes
went
on
de
mouy
yes
you
betray
us
sire
for
several
of
us
at
the
risk
of
our
lives
have
come
to
save
your
honor
and
your
liberty
we
are
prepared
to
offer
you
a
throne
sire
do
you
realize
this
not
only
liberty
but
power
a
throne
of
your
own
choice
for
in
two
months
you
could
choose
between
navarre
and
france
de
mouy
said
henry
covering
his
eyes
which
in
spite
of
himself
had
emitted
a
flash
at
the
above
suggestion
de
mouy
i
am
safe
i
am
a
catholic
i
am
the
husband
of
marguerite
i
am
the
brother
of
king
charles
i
am
the
of
my
good
mother
catharine
de
mouy
in
assuming
these
various
positions
i
have
calculated
their
opportunities
and
also
their
obligations
but
sire
said
de
mouy
what
must
one
believe
i
am
told
that
your
marriage
is
not
contracted
that
at
heart
you
are
free
that
the
hatred
of
catharine
lies
lies
interrupted
the
béarnais
hastily
yes
you
have
been
shamefully
deceived
my
friend
this
dear
marguerite
is
indeed
my
wife
catharine
is
really
my
mother
and
king
charles
ix
is
the
lord
and
master
of
my
life
and
of
my
heart
de
mouy
shuddered
and
an
almost
scornful
smile
passed
over
his
lips
in
that
case
sire
said
he
dropping
his
arms
dejectedly
and
trying
to
fathom
that
soul
filled
with
shadows
this
is
the
answer
i
am
to
take
back
to
my
brothers
i
shall
tell
them
that
the
king
of
navarre
extends
his
hand
and
opens
his
heart
to
those
who
have
cut
our
throats
i
shall
tell
them
that
he
has
become
the
flatterer
of
the
queen
mother
and
the
friend
of
maurevel
my
dear
de
mouy
said
henry
the
king
is
coming
out
of
the
council
chamber
and
i
must
go
and
find
out
from
him
the
reasons
for
our
having
had
to
give
up
so
important
a
thing
as
a
hunt
adieu
imitate
me
my
friend
give
up
politics
return
to
the
king
and
attend
mass
henry
led
or
rather
pushed
into
the
antechamber
the
young
man
whose
amazement
was
beginning
to
change
into
fury
scarcely
was
the
door
closed
before
unable
any
longer
to
resist
the
longing
to
avenge
himself
on
something
in
defence
of
some
one
de
mouy
twisted
his
hat
between
his
hands
threw
it
upon
the
floor
and
stamping
on
it
as
a
bull
would
stamp
on
the
cloak
of
the
matador
by
heaven
he
cried
he
is
a
wretched
prince
and
i
have
half
a
mind
to
kill
myself
here
in
order
to
stain
him
forever
with
my
blood
hush
monsieur
de
mouy
said
a
voice
through
a
door
hush
some
one
besides
myself
might
hear
you
de
mouy
turned
quickly
and
perceived
the
duc
enveloped
in
a
cloak
advancing
into
the
corridor
with
pale
face
to
make
sure
that
he
and
de
mouy
were
entirely
alone
monsieur
le
duc
cried
de
mouy
i
am
lost
on
the
contrary
murmured
the
prince
perhaps
you
have
found
what
you
are
looking
for
and
the
proof
of
this
is
that
i
do
not
want
you
to
kill
yourself
here
as
you
had
an
idea
of
doing
just
now
believe
me
your
blood
can
in
all
probability
be
put
to
better
use
than
to
redden
the
threshold
of
the
king
of
navarre
at
these
words
the
duke
threw
back
the
door
which
he
had
been
holding
half
open
this
chamber
belongs
to
two
of
my
gentlemen
said
the
duke
no
one
will
interrupt
us
here
we
can
therefore
talk
freely
come
in
monsieur
i
here
monseigneur
cried
the
conspirator
in
amazement
he
entered
the
room
the
door
of
which
the
duc
closed
behind
him
no
less
quickly
than
the
king
of
navarre
had
done
de
mouy
entered
furious
exasperated
cursing
but
by
degrees
the
cold
and
steady
glance
of
the
young
duc
françois
had
the
same
effect
on
the
huguenot
captain
as
does
the
enchanted
lake
which
dissipates
drunkenness
monseigneur
said
he
if
i
understand
correctly
your
highness
wishes
to
speak
to
me
yes
monsieur
de
mouy
replied
françois
in
spite
of
your
disguise
i
thought
i
recognized
you
and
when
you
presented
arms
to
my
brother
henry
i
recognized
you
perfectly
well
de
mouy
so
you
are
not
pleased
with
the
king
of
navarre
monseigneur
come
come
tell
me
frankly
unless
you
distrust
me
perhaps
i
am
one
of
your
friends
you
monseigneur
yes
i
so
speak
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
your
highness
monseigneur
the
matter
i
had
to
discuss
with
the
king
of
navarre
concerned
interests
which
your
highness
would
not
comprehend
moreover
added
de
mouy
with
a
manner
which
he
strove
to
render
indifferent
they
were
mere
trifles
trifles
said
the
duke
yes
monseigneur
trifles
for
which
you
felt
you
would
risk
your
life
by
coming
back
to
the
louvre
where
you
know
your
head
is
worth
its
weight
in
gold
we
are
not
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
you
as
well
as
the
king
of
navarre
and
the
prince
de
condé
are
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
huguenots
if
you
think
that
monseigneur
act
towards
me
as
the
brother
of
king
charles
and
the
son
of
queen
catharine
should
act
why
should
you
wish
me
to
act
in
that
way
when
i
have
told
you
that
i
am
a
friend
of
yours
tell
me
the
truth
monseigneur
said
de
mouy
i
swear
to
you
do
not
swear
monseigneur
the
reformed
church
forbids
the
taking
of
oaths
and
especially
of
false
oaths
de
mouy
frowned
i
tell
you
i
know
all
continued
the
duke
de
mouy
was
still
silent
you
doubt
it
said
the
prince
with
affected
persistence
well
my
dear
de
mouy
we
shall
have
to
be
convinced
come
now
you
shall
judge
if
i
am
wrong
did
you
or
did
you
not
propose
to
my
henry
in
his
room
just
now
the
duke
pointed
to
the
chamber
of
the
béarnais
your
aid
and
that
of
your
followers
to
reinstate
him
in
his
kingdom
of
navarre
de
mouy
looked
at
the
duke
with
a
startled
gaze
a
proposition
which
he
refused
with
terror
de
mouy
was
still
amazed
did
you
then
invoke
your
old
friendship
the
remembrance
of
a
common
religion
did
you
even
hold
out
to
the
king
of
navarre
a
very
brilliant
hope
a
hope
so
brilliant
that
he
was
dazzled
by
it
the
hope
of
winning
the
crown
of
france
come
tell
me
am
i
well
informed
is
that
what
you
came
to
propose
to
the
béarnais
monseigneur
cried
de
mouy
this
is
so
true
that
i
now
wonder
if
i
should
not
tell
your
royal
highness
that
you
have
lied
to
arouse
in
this
chamber
a
combat
without
mercy
and
thus
to
make
sure
of
the
extinction
of
this
terrible
secret
by
the
death
of
both
of
us
gently
my
brave
de
mouy
gently
said
the
duc
without
changing
countenance
or
without
taking
the
slightest
notice
of
this
terrible
threat
the
secret
will
die
better
with
us
if
we
both
live
than
if
one
of
us
were
to
die
listen
to
me
and
stop
pulling
at
the
handle
of
your
sword
for
the
third
time
i
say
that
you
are
with
a
friend
now
tell
me
did
not
the
king
of
navarre
refuse
everything
you
offered
him
yes
monseigneur
and
i
admit
it
because
my
avowal
can
compromise
only
myself
on
leaving
his
room
did
you
not
stamp
on
your
hat
and
cry
out
that
he
was
a
cowardly
prince
and
unworthy
of
being
your
leader
that
is
true
monseigneur
i
said
that
ah
you
did
you
admit
it
at
last
yes
and
this
is
still
your
opinion
more
than
ever
monseigneur
well
am
i
monsieur
de
mouy
i
the
third
son
of
henry
i
a
son
of
france
am
i
a
good
enough
gentleman
to
command
your
soldiers
come
now
do
you
think
me
loyal
enough
for
you
to
trust
my
word
you
monseigneur
you
the
leader
of
the
huguenots
why
not
this
is
an
epoch
of
conversions
you
know
henry
has
turned
catholic
i
can
turn
protestant
yes
no
doubt
monseigneur
so
i
am
waiting
for
you
to
explain
to
me
nothing
is
easier
and
in
two
words
i
can
tell
you
the
policy
of
every
one
my
brother
charles
kills
the
huguenots
in
order
to
reign
more
freely
my
brother
of
anjou
lets
them
be
killed
because
he
is
to
succeed
my
brother
charles
and
because
as
you
know
my
brother
charles
is
often
ill
but
with
me
it
is
entirely
different
i
shall
never
reign
at
least
in
france
as
long
as
i
have
two
elder
brothers
the
hatred
of
my
mother
and
of
my
two
brothers
more
than
the
law
of
nature
keeps
me
from
the
throne
i
have
no
claim
to
any
family
affection
any
glory
or
any
kingdom
yet
i
have
a
heart
as
great
as
my
elder
brother
well
de
mouy
i
want
to
look
about
and
with
my
sword
cut
a
kingdom
out
of
this
france
they
cover
with
blood
now
this
is
what
i
want
de
mouy
listen
i
want
to
be
king
of
navarre
not
by
birth
but
by
election
and
note
well
that
you
have
no
objection
to
this
system
i
am
not
a
usurper
since
my
brother
refuses
your
offers
and
buries
himself
in
his
torpor
and
pretends
aloud
that
this
kingdom
of
navarre
is
only
a
myth
with
henry
of
béarn
you
have
nothing
with
me
you
have
a
sword
and
a
name
françois
son
of
france
protector
of
all
his
companions
or
all
his
accomplices
as
you
are
pleased
to
call
them
well
what
do
you
say
to
this
offer
monsieur
de
mouy
i
say
that
it
dazzles
me
monseigneur
de
mouy
de
mouy
we
shall
have
many
obstacles
to
overcome
do
not
therefore
from
the
first
be
so
exacting
and
so
obstinate
towards
the
son
of
a
king
and
the
brother
of
a
king
who
comes
to
you
monseigneur
the
matter
would
be
already
settled
if
my
opinion
were
the
only
one
to
be
considered
but
we
have
a
council
and
brilliant
as
the
offer
may
be
perhaps
even
on
that
very
account
the
leaders
of
the
party
will
not
consent
to
the
plan
unconditionally
that
is
another
thing
and
your
answer
comes
from
an
honest
heart
and
a
prudent
mind
from
the
way
i
have
just
acted
de
mouy
you
must
have
recognized
my
honesty
treat
me
therefore
on
your
part
as
a
man
who
is
esteemed
not
as
a
man
who
is
flattered
de
mouy
have
i
any
chance
on
my
word
monseigneur
since
your
highness
wants
me
to
give
my
opinion
your
highness
has
every
chance
since
the
king
of
navarre
has
refused
the
offer
i
have
just
made
him
but
i
tell
you
again
monseigneur
i
shall
have
to
confer
with
our
leaders
do
so
monsieur
replied
but
when
shall
i
have
an
answer
de
mouy
looked
at
the
prince
in
silence
then
apparently
coming
to
a
decision
monseigneur
said
he
give
me
your
hand
i
must
have
the
hand
of
a
son
of
france
touch
mine
to
make
sure
that
i
shall
not
be
betrayed
the
duke
not
only
extended
his
hand
towards
de
mouy
but
grasped
de
mouy
and
pressed
it
now
monseigneur
i
am
satisfied
said
the
young
huguenot
if
we
were
betrayed
i
should
say
that
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
otherwise
monseigneur
however
slightly
you
might
be
concerned
in
the
treason
you
would
be
dishonored
why
do
you
say
that
to
me
de
mouy
before
telling
me
that
you
will
bring
me
the
answer
from
your
leaders
because
monseigneur
asking
me
when
you
would
have
your
answer
was
the
same
as
asking
me
where
are
the
leaders
and
because
if
i
said
to
you
evening
you
would
know
that
the
chiefs
were
hiding
in
paris
as
he
uttered
these
words
with
a
gesture
of
mistrust
de
mouy
fixed
his
piercing
glance
on
the
false
vacillating
eyes
of
the
young
man
well
well
said
the
duke
you
still
have
doubts
monsieur
de
mouy
but
i
can
not
expect
entire
confidence
from
you
at
first
you
will
understand
me
better
later
we
shall
be
bound
by
common
interests
which
will
rid
you
of
all
suspicion
you
say
this
evening
then
monsieur
de
mouy
yes
monseigneur
for
time
presses
until
this
evening
but
where
shall
i
see
you
if
you
please
at
the
louvre
here
in
this
room
does
that
suit
you
is
this
occupied
said
de
mouy
glancing
at
the
two
beds
opposite
each
other
by
two
of
my
gentlemen
yes
monseigneur
it
seems
to
me
imprudent
to
return
to
the
louvre
why
so
because
if
you
have
recognized
me
others
also
may
have
as
good
eyes
as
your
highness
and
may
recognize
me
however
i
will
return
to
the
louvre
if
you
will
grant
me
what
i
am
about
to
ask
of
you
what
is
that
a
passport
a
passport
from
me
found
on
you
would
ruin
me
and
would
not
save
you
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
unless
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
we
are
strangers
to
each
other
the
slightest
relation
between
us
noticed
by
my
mother
or
my
brother
would
cost
me
my
life
you
were
therefore
protected
by
my
interest
for
myself
from
the
moment
i
compromised
myself
with
the
others
as
i
am
now
compromising
myself
with
you
free
in
my
sphere
of
action
strong
if
i
am
unknown
so
long
as
i
myself
remain
impenetrable
i
will
guarantee
you
everything
do
not
forget
this
make
a
fresh
appeal
to
your
courage
therefore
try
on
my
word
of
honor
what
you
tried
without
the
word
of
honor
of
my
brother
come
this
evening
to
the
louvre
but
how
do
you
wish
me
to
come
i
can
not
venture
in
these
rooms
in
my
present
uniform
it
is
for
the
vestibules
and
the
courts
my
own
is
still
more
dangerous
since
everyone
knows
me
here
and
since
it
in
no
way
disguises
me
therefore
i
will
look
wait
i
think
that
yes
here
it
is
the
duke
had
looked
around
him
and
his
eyes
stopped
at
la
clothes
thrown
temporarily
on
the
bed
that
is
on
the
magnificent
cloak
embroidered
in
gold
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
on
a
cap
ornamented
with
a
white
plume
surrounded
by
a
rope
of
gold
and
silver
marguerites
and
finally
on
a
satin
and
gold
doublet
do
you
see
this
cloak
this
plume
and
this
doublet
said
the
duke
they
belong
to
monsieur
de
la
mole
one
of
my
gentlemen
a
fop
of
the
highest
type
the
cloak
was
the
rage
at
court
and
when
he
wore
it
monsieur
de
la
mole
was
recognized
a
hundred
feet
away
i
will
give
you
the
address
of
the
tailor
who
made
it
for
him
by
paying
him
double
what
it
is
worth
you
will
have
one
exactly
like
it
by
this
evening
you
will
remember
the
name
of
monsieur
de
la
mole
will
you
not
scarcely
had
the
duc
finished
making
the
suggestion
when
a
step
was
heard
approaching
in
the
corridor
and
a
key
was
turned
in
the
lock
who
is
that
cried
the
duke
rushing
to
the
door
and
drawing
the
bolt
by
heaven
replied
a
voice
from
outside
i
find
that
a
strange
question
who
are
you
yourself
this
is
pleasant
i
return
to
my
own
room
and
am
asked
who
i
am
is
it
you
monsieur
de
la
mole
yes
it
is
i
without
a
doubt
but
who
are
you
while
la
mole
was
expressing
his
surprise
at
finding
his
room
occupied
and
while
he
was
trying
to
discover
its
new
occupant
the
duc
turned
quickly
one
hand
on
the
lock
the
other
on
the
key
do
you
know
monsieur
de
la
mole
he
asked
of
de
mouy
no
monseigneur
does
he
know
you
i
think
not
in
that
case
it
will
be
all
right
appear
to
be
looking
out
of
the
window
de
mouy
obeyed
in
silence
for
la
mole
was
beginning
to
grow
impatient
and
was
knocking
on
the
door
with
all
his
might
the
duc
threw
a
last
glance
towards
de
mouy
and
seeing
that
his
back
was
turned
he
opened
the
door
monseigneur
le
duc
cried
la
mole
stepping
back
in
surprise
oh
pardon
pardon
monseigneur
it
is
nothing
monsieur
i
needed
your
room
to
receive
a
visitor
certainly
monseigneur
certainly
but
allow
me
i
beg
you
to
take
my
cloak
and
hat
from
the
bed
for
i
lost
both
on
the
quay
of
the
grève
where
i
was
attacked
by
robbers
in
fact
monsieur
said
the
prince
smiling
himself
handing
to
la
mole
the
articles
asked
for
you
are
very
poorly
accommodated
here
you
have
had
an
encounter
with
some
very
obstinate
fellows
apparently
the
duke
handed
to
la
mole
the
cloak
and
the
hat
the
young
man
bowed
and
withdrew
to
the
antechamber
to
change
his
clothes
paying
no
attention
to
what
the
duke
was
doing
in
his
room
for
it
was
an
ordinary
occurrence
at
the
louvre
for
the
rooms
of
the
gentlemen
to
be
used
as
by
the
prince
to
whom
the
latter
were
attached
de
mouy
then
approached
the
duke
and
both
listened
for
la
mole
to
finish
and
go
out
but
when
the
latter
had
changed
his
clothes
he
himself
saved
them
all
further
trouble
by
drawing
near
to
the
door
pardon
me
monseigneur
said
he
but
did
your
highness
meet
the
count
de
coconnas
on
your
way
no
count
and
yet
he
was
at
service
this
morning
in
that
case
they
will
assassinate
me
said
la
mole
to
himself
as
he
went
away
the
duke
heard
the
noise
of
his
retreating
steps
then
opening
the
door
and
drawing
de
mouy
after
him
watch
him
going
away
said
he
and
try
to
copy
his
inimitable
walk
i
will
do
my
best
replied
de
mouy
unfortunately
i
am
not
a
man
but
a
soldier
at
all
events
i
shall
expect
you
in
this
corridor
before
midnight
if
the
chamber
of
my
gentlemen
is
free
i
will
receive
you
there
if
not
we
will
find
another
yes
monseigneur
until
this
evening
then
before
midnight
until
this
evening
before
midnight
ah
by
the
way
de
mouy
swing
your
right
arm
a
good
deal
as
you
walk
this
is
a
peculiar
trick
of
monsieur
de
la
mole
chapter
xxiv
the
rue
tizon
and
the
rue
cloche
percée
la
mole
hurriedly
left
the
louvre
and
set
out
to
search
paris
for
poor
coconnas
his
first
move
was
to
repair
to
the
rue
de
sec
and
to
enter
maître
la
hurière
for
la
mole
remembered
that
he
had
often
repeated
to
the
piedmontese
a
certain
latin
motto
which
was
meant
to
prove
that
love
bacchus
and
ceres
are
gods
absolutely
necessary
to
us
and
he
hoped
that
coconnas
to
follow
up
the
roman
aphorism
had
gone
to
the
after
a
night
which
must
have
been
as
full
for
his
friend
as
it
had
been
for
himself
la
mole
found
nothing
at
la
hurière
except
the
reminder
of
the
assumed
obligation
a
breakfast
which
was
offered
with
good
grace
was
eagerly
accepted
by
our
gentleman
in
spite
of
his
anxiety
his
stomach
calmed
in
default
of
his
mind
la
mole
resumed
his
walk
ascending
the
bank
of
the
seine
like
a
husband
searching
for
his
drowned
wife
on
reaching
the
quay
of
the
grève
he
recognized
the
place
where
as
he
had
said
to
monsieur
he
had
been
stopped
during
his
nocturnal
tramp
three
or
four
hours
before
this
was
no
unusual
thing
in
paris
older
by
a
hundred
years
than
that
in
which
boileau
was
awakened
at
the
sound
of
a
ball
piercing
his
window
shutter
a
bit
of
the
plume
from
his
hat
remained
on
the
the
sentiment
of
possession
is
innate
in
man
la
mole
had
ten
plumes
each
more
beautiful
than
the
last
and
yet
he
stopped
to
pick
up
that
one
or
rather
the
sole
fragment
of
what
remained
of
it
and
was
contemplating
it
with
a
pitiful
air
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
heavy
steps
approaching
and
rough
voices
ordering
him
to
stand
aside
la
mole
raised
his
head
and
perceived
a
litter
preceded
by
two
pages
and
accompanied
by
an
outrider
la
mole
thought
he
recognized
the
litter
and
quickly
stepped
aside
the
young
man
was
not
mistaken
monsieur
de
la
mole
exclaimed
a
sweet
voice
from
the
litter
while
a
hand
as
white
and
as
smooth
as
satin
drew
back
the
curtains
yes
madame
in
person
replied
la
mole
bowing
monsieur
de
la
mole
with
a
plume
in
his
hand
continued
the
lady
in
the
litter
are
you
in
love
my
dear
monsieur
and
are
you
recovering
lost
traces
yes
madame
replied
la
mole
i
am
in
love
and
very
much
so
but
just
now
these
are
my
own
traces
that
i
have
found
although
they
are
not
those
for
which
i
am
searching
but
will
your
majesty
permit
me
to
inquire
after
your
health
it
is
excellent
monsieur
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
never
been
better
this
probably
comes
from
the
fact
of
my
having
spent
the
night
in
retreat
ah
in
retreat
said
la
mole
looking
at
marguerite
strangely
well
yes
what
is
there
surprising
in
that
may
i
without
indiscretion
ask
you
in
what
convent
certainly
monsieur
i
make
no
mystery
of
it
in
the
convent
of
the
but
what
are
you
doing
here
with
this
startled
air
madame
i
too
passed
the
night
in
retreat
and
in
the
vicinity
of
the
same
convent
this
morning
i
am
looking
for
my
friend
who
has
disappeared
and
in
seeking
him
i
came
upon
this
plume
whom
does
it
belong
to
really
you
frighten
me
about
him
the
place
is
a
bad
one
your
majesty
may
be
reassured
the
plume
belongs
to
me
i
lost
it
here
about
five
as
i
was
escaping
from
the
hands
of
four
bandits
who
tried
with
all
their
might
to
murder
me
or
at
least
i
think
they
did
marguerite
repressed
a
quick
gesture
of
terror
oh
tell
me
about
it
said
she
nothing
is
easier
madame
it
was
as
i
have
had
the
honor
to
tell
your
majesty
about
five
in
the
morning
and
you
were
already
out
at
five
in
the
morning
interrupted
marguerite
your
majesty
will
excuse
me
said
la
mole
i
had
not
yet
returned
ah
monsieur
de
la
mole
you
returned
at
five
in
the
morning
said
marguerite
with
a
smile
which
was
fatal
for
every
one
and
which
la
mole
was
unfortunate
enough
to
find
adorable
you
returned
so
late
you
merited
this
punishment
therefore
i
do
not
complain
madame
said
la
mole
bowing
respectfully
and
i
should
have
been
cut
to
pieces
had
i
not
considered
myself
a
hundred
times
more
fortunate
than
i
deserve
to
be
but
i
was
returning
late
or
early
as
your
majesty
pleases
from
that
fortunate
house
in
which
i
had
spent
the
night
in
retreat
when
four
rushed
from
the
rue
de
la
mortellerie
and
pursued
me
with
indescribably
long
knives
it
is
grotesque
is
it
not
madame
but
it
is
true
i
had
to
run
away
for
i
had
forgotten
my
sword
oh
i
understand
said
marguerite
with
an
admirably
naïve
manner
and
you
have
come
back
to
find
your
sword
la
mole
looked
at
marguerite
as
though
a
suspicion
flashed
through
his
mind
madame
i
would
return
to
some
place
and
very
willingly
too
since
my
sword
is
an
excellent
blade
but
i
do
not
know
where
the
house
is
what
monsieur
exclaimed
marguerite
you
do
not
know
where
the
house
is
in
which
you
passed
the
night
no
madame
and
may
satan
exterminate
me
if
i
have
any
idea
well
this
is
strange
your
story
then
is
a
romance
a
true
romance
as
you
say
madame
tell
it
to
me
it
is
somewhat
long
never
mind
i
have
time
and
above
all
it
is
improbable
never
mind
no
one
could
be
more
credulous
than
i
does
your
majesty
command
me
why
yes
if
necessary
in
that
case
i
obey
last
evening
having
left
two
adorable
women
with
whom
we
had
spent
the
evening
on
the
saint
michel
bridge
we
took
supper
at
maître
la
hurière
in
the
first
place
said
marguerite
perfectly
naturally
who
is
maître
la
hurière
maître
la
hurière
madame
said
la
mole
again
glancing
at
marguerite
with
the
suspicion
he
had
already
felt
maître
la
hurière
is
the
host
of
the
inn
of
the
in
the
rue
de
sec
yes
i
can
see
it
from
here
you
were
supping
then
at
maître
la
hurière
with
your
friend
coconnas
no
doubt
yes
madame
with
my
friend
coconnas
when
a
man
entered
and
handed
us
each
a
note
were
they
alike
asked
marguerite
exactly
alike
they
contained
only
a
single
line
are
awaited
in
the
rue
saint
antoine
opposite
the
rue
saint
and
had
the
note
no
signature
asked
marguerite
no
only
three
words
three
charming
words
which
three
times
promised
the
same
thing
that
is
to
say
a
happiness
and
what
were
these
three
words
cupido
in
short
three
sweet
words
and
did
they
fulfil
what
they
promised
oh
more
madame
a
hundred
times
more
cried
la
mole
with
enthusiasm
continue
i
am
curious
to
know
who
was
waiting
for
you
in
the
rue
saint
antoine
opposite
the
rue
de
jouy
two
duennas
each
with
a
handkerchief
in
her
hand
they
said
we
must
let
them
bandage
our
eyes
your
majesty
may
imagine
that
it
was
not
a
difficult
thing
to
have
done
we
bravely
extended
our
necks
my
guide
turned
me
to
the
left
my
friend
guide
turned
him
to
the
right
and
we
were
separated
and
then
continued
marguerite
who
seemed
determined
to
carry
out
the
investigation
to
the
end
i
do
not
know
said
la
mole
where
his
guide
led
my
friend
to
hell
perhaps
as
to
myself
all
i
know
is
that
mine
led
me
to
a
place
i
consider
paradise
and
whence
no
doubt
your
too
great
curiosity
drove
you
exactly
madame
you
have
the
gift
of
divination
i
waited
impatiently
for
daylight
that
i
might
see
where
i
was
when
at
four
the
same
duenna
returned
again
bandaged
my
eyes
made
me
promise
not
to
try
to
raise
my
bandage
led
me
outside
accompanied
me
for
a
hundred
feet
made
me
again
swear
not
to
remove
my
bandage
until
i
had
counted
fifty
more
i
counted
fifty
and
found
myself
in
the
rue
saint
antoine
opposite
the
rue
de
jouy
and
then
then
madame
i
returned
so
happy
that
i
paid
no
attention
to
the
four
wretches
from
whose
clutches
i
had
such
difficulty
in
escaping
now
madame
continued
la
mole
in
finding
a
piece
of
my
plume
here
my
heart
trembled
with
joy
and
i
picked
it
up
promising
myself
to
keep
it
as
a
souvenir
of
this
glad
night
but
in
the
midst
of
my
happiness
one
thing
troubles
me
that
is
what
may
have
become
of
my
companion
has
he
not
returned
to
the
louvre
alas
no
madame
i
have
searched
everywhere
in
the
on
the
tennis
courts
and
in
many
other
respectable
places
but
no
annibal
and
no
coconnas
as
la
mole
uttered
these
words
he
accompanied
them
with
a
gesture
of
hopelessness
extended
his
arms
and
opened
his
cloak
underneath
which
at
various
points
his
doublet
was
seen
the
lining
of
which
showed
through
the
rents
like
so
many
elegant
slashes
why
you
were
riddled
through
and
through
exclaimed
marguerite
riddled
is
the
word
said
la
mole
who
was
not
sorry
to
turn
to
his
account
the
danger
he
had
run
see
madame
see
why
did
you
not
change
your
doublet
at
the
louvre
since
you
returned
there
asked
the
queen
ah
said
la
mole
because
some
one
was
in
my
room
some
one
in
your
room
said
marguerite
whose
eyes
expressed
the
greatest
astonishment
who
was
in
your
room
his
highness
hush
interrupted
marguerite
the
young
man
obeyed
ad
lecticam
meam
stant
she
asked
la
mole
pueri
et
unus
barbari
said
she
moles
quem
inveneris
in
biculo
tuo
that
is
strange
said
marguerite
so
you
were
unable
to
find
coconnas
she
continued
without
evidently
thinking
of
what
she
was
saying
so
madame
as
i
have
had
the
honor
of
telling
you
i
am
really
dying
of
anxiety
well
said
marguerite
sighing
i
do
not
wish
to
detain
you
longer
in
your
search
for
him
i
do
not
know
why
i
think
so
but
he
will
find
himself
never
mind
however
go
in
spite
of
this
the
queen
laid
a
finger
on
her
lips
but
as
beautiful
marguerite
had
confided
no
secret
had
made
no
avowal
to
la
mole
the
young
man
understood
that
this
charming
gesture
meaning
only
to
impose
silence
on
him
must
have
another
significance
the
procession
resumed
its
march
and
la
mole
intent
on
following
out
his
investigation
continued
to
ascend
the
quay
as
far
as
the
rue
long
pont
which
led
him
to
the
rue
saint
antoine
opposite
the
rue
jouy
he
stopped
it
was
there
that
the
previous
evening
the
two
duennas
had
bandaged
his
eyes
and
those
of
coconnas
he
had
turned
to
the
left
then
he
had
counted
twenty
steps
he
repeated
this
and
found
himself
opposite
a
house
or
rather
a
wall
behind
which
rose
a
house
in
this
wall
was
a
door
with
a
shed
over
it
ornamented
with
large
nails
and
the
house
was
in
the
rue
cloche
percée
a
small
narrow
street
beginning
in
the
rue
saint
antoine
and
ending
in
the
rue
roi
de
sicile
by
heaven
cried
la
mole
it
was
here
i
would
swear
to
it
in
extending
my
hand
as
i
came
out
i
felt
the
nails
in
the
door
then
i
descended
two
steps
the
man
who
ran
by
crying
who
was
killed
in
the
rue
roi
de
sicile
passed
just
as
i
reached
the
first
let
us
see
now
la
mole
went
to
the
door
and
knocked
the
door
opened
and
a
mustached
janitor
appeared
ist
das
who
is
that
asked
the
janitor
ah
ah
said
la
mole
we
are
swiss
apparently
my
friend
he
continued
assuming
the
most
charming
manner
i
want
my
sword
which
i
left
in
this
house
in
which
i
spent
the
night
verstehe
i
do
not
understand
replied
the
janitor
my
sword
went
on
la
mole
verstehe
repeated
the
which
i
left
my
sword
which
i
left
verstehe
in
this
house
in
which
i
spent
the
night
zum
teufel
go
to
the
devil
and
he
slammed
the
door
in
la
mole
face
by
heaven
cried
la
mole
if
i
had
this
sword
i
have
just
asked
for
i
would
gladly
put
it
through
that
fellow
body
but
i
have
not
and
this
must
wait
for
another
day
thereupon
la
mole
continued
his
way
to
the
rue
roi
de
sicile
took
about
fifty
steps
to
the
right
then
to
the
left
again
and
came
to
the
rue
tizon
a
little
street
running
parallel
with
the
rue
cloche
percée
and
like
it
in
every
way
more
than
this
scarcely
had
he
gone
thirty
steps
before
he
came
upon
the
door
with
the
large
nails
with
its
shed
and
the
two
steps
and
the
wall
one
would
have
said
that
the
rue
cloche
percée
had
returned
to
see
him
pass
by
la
mole
then
reflected
that
he
might
have
mistaken
his
right
for
his
left
and
he
knocked
at
this
door
to
make
the
same
demand
he
had
made
at
the
other
but
this
time
he
knocked
in
vain
the
door
was
not
opened
two
or
three
times
la
mole
made
the
same
trip
which
naturally
led
him
to
the
idea
that
the
house
had
two
entrances
one
on
the
rue
cloche
percée
the
other
on
the
rue
tizon
but
this
conclusion
logical
as
it
was
did
not
bring
him
back
his
sword
and
did
not
tell
him
where
his
friend
was
for
an
instant
he
conceived
the
idea
of
buying
another
sword
and
cutting
to
pieces
the
wretched
janitor
who
so
persistently
refused
to
speak
anything
but
german
but
he
thought
this
porter
belonged
to
marguerite
and
that
if
marguerite
had
chosen
thus
it
was
because
she
had
her
reasons
and
that
it
might
be
disagreeable
for
her
to
be
deprived
of
him
now
la
mole
would
not
have
done
anything
disagreeable
to
marguerite
for
anything
in
the
world
fearing
to
yield
to
this
temptation
he
returned
about
two
in
the
afternoon
to
the
louvre
as
his
room
was
not
occupied
this
time
he
could
enter
it
the
matter
was
urgent
enough
as
far
as
his
doublet
was
concerned
which
as
the
queen
had
already
remarked
to
him
was
considerably
torn
he
therefore
at
once
approached
his
bed
to
substitute
the
beautiful
doublet
for
the
one
he
wore
when
to
his
great
surprise
the
first
thing
he
perceived
near
the
doublet
was
the
famous
sword
which
he
had
left
in
the
rue
cloche
percée
la
mole
took
it
and
turned
it
over
and
over
it
was
really
his
ah
ah
said
he
is
there
some
magic
under
all
this
then
with
a
sigh
ah
if
poor
coconnas
could
be
found
like
my
sword
two
or
three
hours
after
la
mole
had
ceased
his
circular
tramp
around
the
small
double
house
the
door
on
the
rue
tizon
had
opened
it
was
about
five
in
the
evening
consequently
night
had
closed
in
a
woman
wrapped
in
a
long
cloak
trimmed
with
fur
accompanied
by
an
attendant
came
out
of
the
door
which
was
held
open
by
a
duenna
of
forty
and
hurrying
rapidly
along
to
the
rue
roi
de
sicile
knocked
at
a
small
door
of
the
hôtel
argenson
which
opened
for
her
she
then
left
by
the
main
entrance
of
the
same
hôtel
which
opened
on
to
the
vieille
rue
du
temple
went
toward
a
small
postern
in
the
hôtel
de
guise
unlocked
it
with
a
key
which
she
carried
in
her
pocket
and
disappeared
half
an
hour
later
a
young
man
with
bandaged
eyes
left
by
the
same
door
of
the
small
house
guided
by
a
woman
who
led
him
to
the
corner
of
the
rue
geoffroy
lasnier
and
la
mortellerie
there
she
asked
him
to
count
fifty
steps
and
then
remove
his
bandage
the
young
man
carefully
obeyed
the
order
and
when
he
had
counted
fifty
removed
the
handkerchief
from
his
eyes
by
heaven
cried
he
looking
around
i
be
hanged
if
i
know
where
i
am
six
he
cried
as
the
clock
of
struck
and
poor
la
mole
what
can
have
become
of
him
let
us
run
to
the
louvre
perhaps
they
may
have
news
of
him
there
coconnas
hurriedly
descended
the
rue
la
mortellerie
and
reached
the
gates
of
the
louvre
in
less
time
than
it
would
have
taken
an
ordinary
horse
as
he
went
he
jostled
and
knocked
down
the
moving
hedge
of
brave
bourgeois
who
were
walking
peacefully
about
the
shops
of
the
place
de
baudoyer
and
entered
the
palace
there
he
questioned
the
swiss
and
the
sentinel
the
former
thought
they
had
seen
monsieur
de
la
mole
enter
that
morning
but
had
not
seen
him
go
out
the
sentinel
had
been
there
only
an
hour
and
a
half
and
had
seen
nothing
he
ran
to
his
room
and
hastily
threw
open
the
door
but
he
found
only
the
torn
doublet
of
la
mole
on
the
bed
which
increased
his
fears
still
more
then
he
thought
of
la
hurière
and
hastened
to
the
worthy
inn
of
the
la
hurière
had
seen
la
mole
la
mole
had
breakfasted
there
coconnas
was
thus
wholly
reassured
and
as
he
was
very
hungry
he
ordered
supper
coconnas
was
in
the
two
moods
necessary
for
a
good
supper
his
mind
was
relieved
and
his
stomach
was
empty
therefore
he
supped
so
well
that
the
meal
lasted
till
eight
then
strengthened
by
two
bottles
of
light
wine
from
anjou
of
which
he
was
very
fond
and
which
he
tossed
off
with
a
sensual
enjoyment
shown
by
winks
of
his
eyes
and
repeated
smacking
of
his
lips
he
set
out
again
in
his
search
for
la
mole
accompanying
it
through
the
crowd
by
kicks
and
knocks
of
his
feet
in
proportion
to
the
increasing
friendship
inspired
in
him
by
the
comfort
which
always
follows
a
good
meal
that
lasted
one
hour
during
which
time
coconnas
searched
every
street
in
the
vicinity
of
the
quay
of
the
grève
the
port
au
charbon
the
rue
saint
antoine
and
the
rues
tizon
and
cloche
percée
to
which
he
thought
his
friend
might
have
returned
finally
he
bethought
himself
that
there
was
a
place
through
which
he
had
to
pass
the
gate
of
the
louvre
and
he
resolved
to
wait
at
this
gate
until
his
return
he
was
not
more
than
a
hundred
steps
from
the
louvre
and
had
just
put
on
her
feet
a
woman
whose
husband
he
had
already
overturned
on
the
place
saint
germain
when
in
the
distance
he
perceived
before
him
in
the
doubtful
light
of
a
great
lantern
near
the
drawbridge
of
the
louvre
the
velvet
cloak
and
the
white
plume
of
his
friend
who
like
a
shadow
was
disappearing
under
the
gate
and
returning
the
sentinel
greeting
the
famous
cloak
was
so
well
known
to
every
one
that
he
could
not
be
mistaken
in
it
well
by
heaven
cried
coconnas
it
is
really
he
this
time
and
he
is
returning
well
well
la
mole
my
friend
plague
it
yet
i
have
a
good
voice
how
does
it
happen
that
he
does
not
hear
me
fortunately
i
have
as
good
legs
as
i
have
voice
so
i
will
join
him
in
this
hope
coconnas
set
out
as
fast
as
he
could
and
reached
the
louvre
in
an
instant
but
fast
as
he
was
just
as
he
stepped
into
the
court
the
red
cloak
which
seemed
in
haste
also
disappeared
in
the
vestibule
hi
there
la
mole
cried
coconnas
still
hastening
wait
for
me
it
is
i
coconnas
what
in
the
devil
are
you
hurrying
so
for
are
you
running
away
in
fact
the
red
cloak
as
though
it
had
wings
scaled
the
stairs
rather
than
mounted
them
ah
you
will
not
hear
me
cried
coconnas
i
am
angry
with
you
are
you
sorry
well
the
devil
i
can
run
no
further
it
was
from
the
foot
of
the
staircase
that
coconnas
hurled
this
final
apostrophe
to
the
fugitive
whom
he
gave
up
following
with
his
feet
but
whom
he
still
followed
with
his
eyes
through
the
screw
of
the
stairway
and
who
had
reached
marguerite
chamber
suddenly
a
woman
came
out
of
this
room
and
took
the
arm
of
the
man
coconnas
was
following
oh
oh
said
coconnas
that
looked
very
much
like
queen
marguerite
he
was
expected
in
that
case
it
is
different
i
understand
why
he
did
not
answer
me
crouching
down
by
the
banister
he
looked
through
the
opening
of
the
stairway
then
after
a
few
words
in
a
low
voice
he
saw
the
red
cloak
follow
the
queen
to
her
apartments
good
good
said
coconnas
that
is
it
i
was
not
mistaken
there
are
moments
when
the
presence
of
our
best
friend
is
necessary
to
us
and
dear
la
mole
has
one
of
those
moments
and
coconnas
ascending
the
stairs
softly
sat
down
on
a
velvet
bench
which
ornamented
the
landing
place
and
said
to
himself
very
well
instead
of
joining
him
i
will
wait
yes
but
he
added
i
think
as
he
is
with
the
queen
of
navarre
i
may
have
to
wait
long
it
is
cold
by
heaven
well
well
i
can
wait
just
as
well
in
my
room
he
will
have
to
come
there
sometime
scarcely
had
he
finished
speaking
and
started
to
carry
out
his
resolution
when
a
quick
light
step
sounded
above
him
accompanied
by
a
snatch
of
song
so
familiar
that
coconnas
at
once
turned
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
step
and
the
song
it
was
la
mole
descending
from
the
upper
story
where
his
room
was
when
he
perceived
coconnas
he
began
to
descend
the
stairs
four
steps
at
a
time
and
this
done
he
threw
himself
into
his
arms
oh
heavens
is
it
you
said
coconnas
how
the
devil
did
you
get
out
by
the
rue
cloche
percée
by
heavens
no
i
do
not
mean
that
house
what
then
the
queen
apartment
the
queen
apartment
the
queen
of
navarre
i
have
not
been
there
come
now
my
dear
annibal
said
la
mole
you
are
out
of
your
head
i
have
come
from
my
room
where
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
for
two
hours
you
have
come
from
your
room
yes
was
it
not
you
i
followed
from
the
place
du
louvre
when
just
now
no
it
was
not
you
who
disappeared
under
the
gate
ten
minutes
ago
no
it
was
not
you
who
just
ascended
the
stairs
as
if
you
were
pursued
by
a
legion
of
devils
no
by
heaven
cried
coconnas
the
wine
of
the
is
not
poor
enough
to
have
so
completely
turned
my
head
i
tell
you
that
i
have
just
seen
your
cloak
and
your
white
plume
under
the
gate
of
the
louvre
that
i
followed
both
to
the
foot
of
the
stairway
and
that
your
cloak
your
plume
everything
to
your
swinging
arm
was
expected
here
by
a
lady
whom
i
greatly
suspect
to
be
the
queen
of
navarre
and
who
led
you
through
that
door
which
unless
i
am
mistaken
is
that
of
the
beautiful
marguerite
by
heaven
cried
la
mole
growing
pale
could
there
be
treason
very
good
said
coconnas
swear
as
much
as
you
please
but
do
not
tell
me
i
am
mistaken
la
mole
hesitated
an
instant
pressing
his
head
between
his
hands
deterred
by
respect
and
jealousy
his
jealousy
conquered
him
however
and
he
hastened
to
the
door
at
which
he
knocked
with
all
his
might
this
caused
a
somewhat
unusual
hubbub
considering
the
dignity
of
the
place
in
which
it
occurred
we
shall
be
arrested
said
coconnas
but
no
matter
it
is
very
funny
tell
me
la
mole
are
there
ghosts
in
the
louvre
i
know
nothing
about
it
said
the
young
man
as
pale
as
the
plume
which
shaded
his
brow
but
i
have
always
wanted
to
see
one
and
as
the
opportunity
presents
itself
i
shall
do
my
best
to
come
face
to
face
with
this
one
i
shall
not
prevent
you
said
coconnas
only
knock
a
little
less
fiercely
if
you
do
not
wish
to
frighten
it
away
la
mole
exasperated
as
he
was
felt
the
justice
of
the
remark
and
began
to
knock
more
gently
chapter
xxv
the
cloak
coconnas
was
not
mistaken
the
lady
who
had
stopped
the
cavalier
of
the
cloak
was
indeed
the
queen
of
navarre
as
to
the
cavalier
our
reader
has
already
guessed
i
presume
that
he
was
no
other
than
brave
de
mouy
upon
recognizing
the
queen
of
navarre
the
young
huguenot
realized
that
there
was
some
mistake
but
he
dared
not
speak
fearing
a
cry
from
marguerite
would
betray
him
he
preferred
to
let
himself
be
led
to
her
apartments
and
when
once
there
to
say
to
his
beautiful
guide
silence
for
silence
madame
marguerite
had
gently
pressed
the
arm
of
him
whom
in
the
she
had
mistaken
for
la
mole
and
leaning
toward
him
whispered
in
latin
sum
introito
de
mouy
without
answering
let
her
lead
him
along
but
scarcely
was
the
door
closed
behind
him
and
he
found
himself
in
the
antechamber
which
was
better
lighted
than
the
stairway
before
marguerite
saw
that
he
was
not
la
mole
thereupon
the
cry
which
the
cautious
huguenot
had
feared
escaped
marguerite
but
fortunately
there
was
no
further
danger
from
it
monsieur
de
mouy
cried
she
stepping
back
in
person
madame
and
i
beg
your
majesty
to
leave
me
free
to
continue
my
way
without
mentioning
my
presence
in
the
louvre
to
any
one
oh
monsieur
de
mouy
reiterated
marguerite
i
was
mistaken
then
yes
said
de
mouy
i
understand
your
majesty
mistook
me
for
the
king
of
navarre
i
am
the
same
height
i
wear
the
same
white
plume
and
many
no
doubt
in
order
to
flatter
me
say
i
have
the
same
gait
marguerite
looked
closely
at
de
mouy
do
you
understand
latin
monsieur
de
mouy
she
asked
i
used
to
know
it
replied
the
young
man
but
i
have
forgotten
it
marguerite
smiled
monsieur
de
mouy
said
she
you
may
rely
on
my
discretion
but
as
i
think
i
know
the
name
of
the
one
you
are
seeking
in
the
louvre
i
will
offer
my
services
to
guide
you
directly
to
him
excuse
me
madame
said
de
mouy
i
think
you
are
mistaken
and
that
you
are
completely
ignorant
of
what
exclaimed
marguerite
are
you
not
looking
for
the
king
of
navarre
alas
madame
said
de
mouy
i
regret
to
have
to
beg
you
especially
to
conceal
my
presence
in
the
louvre
from
your
husband
his
majesty
the
king
listen
monsieur
de
mouy
said
marguerite
in
surprise
i
have
considered
you
until
now
one
of
the
strongest
leaders
of
the
huguenot
party
and
one
of
the
most
faithful
partisans
of
the
king
my
husband
am
i
mistaken
no
madame
for
this
very
morning
i
was
all
that
you
say
and
what
has
changed
you
since
this
morning
madame
said
de
mouy
bowing
kindly
excuse
me
from
answering
and
do
me
the
favor
to
accept
my
homage
de
mouy
respectful
but
firm
started
towards
the
door
marguerite
stopped
him
but
monsieur
said
she
if
i
were
to
ask
you
for
a
word
of
explanation
my
word
is
good
it
seems
to
me
madame
replied
de
mouy
i
am
obliged
to
keep
silent
and
this
duty
must
be
very
imperative
for
me
not
to
have
answered
your
majesty
but
monsieur
your
majesty
may
ruin
me
madame
but
you
can
not
ask
me
to
betray
my
new
friends
but
the
old
ones
monsieur
have
they
too
not
some
rights
those
who
have
remained
true
yes
those
who
not
only
have
abandoned
us
but
themselves
as
well
no
marguerite
thoughtful
and
anxious
would
no
doubt
have
answered
by
a
new
question
had
not
gillonne
suddenly
entered
the
apartment
the
king
of
navarre
she
cried
how
is
he
coming
by
the
secret
corridor
take
monsieur
out
by
the
other
impossible
madame
listen
some
one
is
knocking
yes
at
the
door
to
which
you
wish
me
to
take
monsieur
who
is
knocking
i
do
not
know
go
and
see
and
come
back
and
tell
me
madame
said
de
mouy
might
i
venture
to
remark
to
your
majesty
that
if
the
king
of
navarre
sees
me
at
this
hour
and
in
this
costume
in
the
louvre
i
am
lost
marguerite
seized
de
mouy
and
pushed
him
towards
the
famous
cabinet
step
in
here
monsieur
said
she
you
will
be
as
safe
and
as
well
protected
as
if
you
were
in
your
own
house
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
de
mouy
entered
hastily
scarcely
was
the
door
closed
when
henry
appeared
this
time
marguerite
had
no
anxiety
to
hide
she
was
merely
gloomy
and
love
was
far
from
her
thoughts
as
to
henry
he
entered
with
that
mistrust
which
in
the
most
dangerous
moments
caused
him
to
notice
the
smallest
details
whatever
the
circumstances
henry
was
an
acute
observer
therefore
he
at
once
saw
the
cloud
on
marguerite
brow
you
are
busy
madame
said
he
i
why
yes
sire
i
was
dreaming
you
do
well
madame
dreaming
is
becoming
to
you
i
too
was
dreaming
but
contrary
to
you
who
seek
solitude
i
have
come
on
purpose
to
share
my
dreams
with
you
marguerite
gave
the
king
a
gesture
of
welcome
and
indicating
an
armchair
to
him
seated
herself
on
a
chair
of
sculptured
ebony
as
delicate
and
as
strong
as
steel
there
was
an
silence
then
henry
broke
it
i
remembered
madame
said
he
that
my
dreams
as
to
the
future
corresponded
with
yours
in
so
far
as
although
separated
as
husband
and
wife
nevertheless
we
both
desire
to
unite
our
fortune
that
is
true
sire
i
think
i
understood
you
to
say
also
that
in
all
the
plans
i
might
make
toward
our
mutual
rising
i
would
find
in
you
not
only
a
faithful
but
an
active
ally
yes
sire
and
i
ask
only
one
thing
that
in
beginning
the
work
as
soon
as
possible
you
will
give
me
the
opportunity
to
begin
also
i
am
glad
to
find
you
of
this
mind
madame
and
i
trust
that
you
have
not
for
one
instant
doubted
that
i
would
lose
sight
of
the
plan
i
resolved
to
carry
out
the
very
day
when
thanks
to
your
brave
intervention
i
was
almost
sure
of
being
safe
monsieur
i
think
that
your
carelessness
is
nothing
but
a
mask
and
i
have
faith
not
only
in
the
predictions
by
the
astrologers
but
in
your
good
genius
as
well
what
should
you
say
madame
if
someone
were
to
upset
our
plans
and
threaten
to
reduce
us
to
an
ordinary
position
i
should
say
that
i
was
ready
to
fight
with
you
either
openly
or
in
secret
against
this
someone
whoever
he
might
be
madame
continued
henry
it
is
possible
for
you
is
it
not
to
gain
immediate
admission
into
the
room
of
your
brother
monsieur
you
are
in
his
confidence
and
he
is
very
friendly
to
you
might
i
venture
to
beg
you
to
find
out
if
he
is
at
present
holding
a
secret
conference
with
someone
marguerite
gave
a
start
with
whom
monsieur
she
asked
with
de
mouy
why
asked
marguerite
repressing
her
emotion
because
if
such
is
the
case
madame
farewell
to
all
our
projects
or
to
all
mine
at
least
sire
speak
softly
said
marguerite
making
a
sign
with
her
eyes
and
lips
and
pointing
to
the
cabinet
oh
oh
said
henry
still
someone
indeed
that
cabinet
is
so
often
occupied
that
it
makes
your
room
uninhabitable
marguerite
smiled
is
it
still
monsieur
de
la
mole
asked
henry
no
sire
it
is
monsieur
de
mouy
he
cried
henry
with
surprise
mingled
with
joy
he
is
not
with
the
duc
then
oh
have
him
come
in
that
i
may
talk
to
him
marguerite
stepped
to
the
cabinet
opened
it
and
taking
de
mouy
by
the
hand
led
him
without
preamble
to
the
king
of
navarre
ah
madame
said
the
young
huguenot
in
a
tone
of
reproach
more
sad
than
bitter
you
have
betrayed
me
in
spite
of
your
promise
that
is
wrong
what
should
you
do
if
i
were
to
avenge
myself
by
saying
you
will
not
avenge
yourself
de
mouy
interrupted
henry
pressing
the
young
man
hand
or
at
least
you
will
listen
to
me
first
madame
continued
henry
turning
to
the
queen
be
kind
enough
i
beg
you
to
see
that
no
one
overhears
us
scarcely
had
henry
uttered
these
words
when
gillonne
entered
frightened
and
whispered
a
few
words
to
marguerite
which
caused
the
latter
to
spring
from
her
seat
while
she
hastened
to
the
antechamber
with
gillonne
henry
without
troubling
himself
as
to
why
she
had
left
the
room
examined
the
bed
the
side
of
it
as
well
as
the
draperies
and
sounded
the
wall
with
his
fingers
as
to
monsieur
de
mouy
frightened
at
all
these
preparations
he
first
of
all
made
sure
that
his
sword
was
out
of
its
sheath
leaving
her
marguerite
hastened
to
the
antechamber
and
came
face
to
face
with
la
mole
who
in
spite
of
all
the
protests
of
gillonne
had
forced
his
way
into
marguerite
room
coconnas
was
behind
him
ready
to
urge
him
forward
or
sustain
a
retreat
ah
it
is
you
monsieur
la
mole
cried
the
queen
but
what
is
the
matter
and
why
are
you
so
pale
and
trembling
madame
said
gillonne
monsieur
de
la
mole
knocked
at
the
door
so
that
in
spite
of
your
majesty
orders
i
was
forced
to
open
it
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
said
the
queen
severely
is
this
true
monsieur
de
la
mole
madame
i
wanted
to
warn
your
majesty
that
a
stranger
a
robber
perhaps
had
gained
admittance
to
your
rooms
with
my
cloak
and
my
hat
you
are
mad
monsieur
said
marguerite
for
i
see
your
cloak
on
your
shoulders
and
god
forgive
me
i
think
i
see
your
hat
on
your
head
even
though
you
are
speaking
to
a
queen
oh
pardon
me
madame
pardon
me
cried
la
mole
quickly
uncovering
but
god
is
my
witness
it
is
not
my
respect
which
is
lacking
no
it
is
your
trust
is
it
not
said
the
queen
what
can
you
expect
cried
la
mole
when
a
man
is
in
your
rooms
when
he
gains
admittance
by
assuming
my
clothes
and
perhaps
my
name
who
knows
a
man
cried
marguerite
softly
pressing
her
poor
lover
arm
a
man
you
are
modest
monsieur
de
la
mole
look
through
the
opening
of
the
portière
and
you
will
see
two
men
marguerite
drew
back
the
velvet
portière
embroidered
in
gold
and
la
mole
saw
henry
talking
with
the
man
in
the
cloak
coconnas
as
though
he
himself
were
concerned
looked
also
saw
and
recognized
de
mouy
both
men
stood
amazed
now
that
you
are
reassured
or
at
least
now
that
i
hope
you
are
said
marguerite
take
your
stand
outside
my
door
and
for
your
life
my
dear
la
mole
let
no
one
enter
if
any
one
even
approaches
the
stairs
warn
me
la
mole
weak
and
obedient
as
a
child
withdrew
glancing
at
coconnas
who
looked
at
him
both
found
themselves
outside
without
having
thoroughly
recovered
from
their
astonishment
de
mouy
cried
coconnas
henry
murmured
la
mole
de
mouy
with
your
cloak
your
white
plume
and
your
swinging
arm
ah
went
on
la
mole
the
moment
it
is
not
a
question
of
love
it
is
a
question
of
plot
by
heaven
here
we
are
in
the
midst
of
politics
said
coconnas
grumbling
fortunately
i
do
not
see
madame
de
nevers
mixed
up
in
it
marguerite
returned
and
sat
down
by
the
two
speakers
she
had
been
gone
only
a
moment
but
had
made
the
most
of
her
time
gillonne
on
guard
in
the
secret
passage
and
the
two
gentlemen
on
duty
at
the
main
entrance
assured
perfect
safety
for
her
madame
said
henry
do
you
think
it
would
be
possible
for
us
to
be
overheard
in
any
way
monsieur
said
marguerite
the
walls
of
this
room
are
wadded
and
a
double
wainscoting
deadens
all
sound
i
depend
on
you
replied
henry
smiling
then
turning
to
de
mouy
now
said
the
king
in
a
low
tone
as
if
in
spite
of
the
assurance
of
marguerite
his
fears
were
not
wholly
overcome
what
are
you
here
for
here
said
de
mouy
yes
here
in
this
room
repeated
henry
he
had
nothing
to
do
here
said
marguerite
i
induced
him
to
come
you
i
guessed
everything
you
see
de
mouy
we
can
discover
what
is
going
on
this
morning
continued
marguerite
monsieur
de
mouy
was
with
duc
françois
in
the
apartment
of
two
of
his
gentlemen
you
see
de
mouy
repeated
henry
we
know
everything
that
is
true
said
de
mouy
i
was
sure
said
henry
that
monsieur
had
taken
possession
of
you
that
is
your
fault
sire
why
did
you
so
persistently
refuse
what
i
offered
you
you
refused
exclaimed
marguerite
the
refusal
i
feared
then
was
real
madame
said
henry
shaking
his
head
and
you
my
brave
de
mouy
really
you
make
me
laugh
with
your
exclamations
what
a
man
enters
my
chamber
speaks
to
me
of
a
throne
of
a
revolt
of
a
revolution
to
me
henry
a
prince
tolerated
provided
that
i
eat
humble
pie
a
huguenot
spared
on
condition
that
i
play
the
catholic
and
i
am
expected
to
accept
when
these
propositions
are
made
in
a
room
without
padding
or
double
wainscoting
saint
gris
you
are
either
children
or
fools
but
sire
could
not
your
majesty
have
left
me
some
hope
if
not
by
word
at
least
by
a
gesture
or
sign
what
did
my
say
to
you
de
mouy
asked
henry
oh
sire
that
is
not
my
secret
well
my
god
continued
henry
with
a
certain
impatience
at
having
to
deal
with
a
man
who
so
poorly
understood
his
words
i
do
not
ask
what
you
proposed
to
him
i
ask
you
merely
if
he
listened
to
you
if
he
heard
you
he
listened
sire
and
he
heard
he
listened
and
he
heard
you
admit
it
yourself
de
mouy
tactless
conspirator
that
you
are
had
i
said
one
word
you
would
have
been
lost
for
i
did
not
know
i
merely
suspected
that
he
was
there
or
if
not
he
someone
else
the
duc
charles
or
the
queen
mother
for
instance
you
do
not
know
the
walls
of
the
louvre
de
mouy
it
was
for
them
that
the
proverb
was
made
which
says
that
walls
have
ears
and
knowing
these
walls
you
expected
me
to
speak
well
well
de
mouy
you
pay
a
small
compliment
to
the
common
sense
of
the
king
of
navarre
and
i
am
surprised
that
not
esteeming
him
more
highly
you
should
have
offered
him
a
crown
but
sire
said
de
mouy
could
you
not
even
while
refusing
this
crown
have
given
me
some
sign
in
that
case
i
should
not
have
considered
everything
hopeless
and
lost
well
saint
gris
exclaimed
henry
if
one
can
hear
can
not
one
see
also
and
is
not
one
lost
by
a
sign
as
much
as
by
a
word
see
de
mouy
continued
the
king
looking
around
him
at
the
present
moment
so
near
to
you
that
my
words
do
not
reach
beyond
the
circle
of
our
three
chairs
i
still
fear
i
may
be
overheard
when
i
say
de
mouy
repeat
your
proposal
to
me
but
sire
cried
de
mouy
in
despair
i
am
now
engaged
with
monsieur
marguerite
angrily
clasped
and
unclasped
her
beautiful
hands
then
it
is
too
late
said
she
on
the
contrary
murmured
henry
know
that
even
in
this
god
hand
is
visible
continue
your
arrangement
de
mouy
for
in
duc
françois
lies
our
safety
do
you
suppose
that
the
king
of
navarre
would
guarantee
your
heads
on
the
contrary
wretched
man
i
should
have
you
all
killed
to
the
last
one
and
on
the
least
suspicion
but
with
a
son
of
france
it
is
different
secure
proofs
de
mouy
ask
for
guarantees
but
stupid
that
you
are
you
will
be
deeply
involved
and
one
word
will
suffice
for
you
oh
sire
it
was
my
despair
at
your
having
left
us
believe
me
which
threw
me
into
the
arms
of
the
duke
it
was
also
the
fear
of
being
betrayed
for
he
kept
our
secret
keep
his
now
de
mouy
it
rests
with
you
what
does
he
wish
to
leave
court
furnish
him
with
means
to
escape
work
for
him
de
mouy
as
if
you
were
working
for
me
turn
the
shield
so
that
he
may
parry
every
blow
they
aim
at
us
when
it
is
time
to
flee
we
will
both
flee
when
it
is
time
to
fight
and
reign
i
will
reign
alone
do
not
trust
the
duke
said
marguerite
he
is
gloomy
and
acute
without
hatred
as
without
love
ever
ready
to
treat
his
friends
like
enemies
and
his
enemies
like
friends
and
he
is
expecting
you
now
de
mouy
said
henry
yes
sire
where
in
the
apartment
belonging
to
his
two
gentlemen
at
what
time
before
midnight
it
is
not
yet
eleven
said
henry
so
you
have
lost
no
time
now
you
may
go
de
mouy
we
have
your
word
monsieur
said
marguerite
come
now
madame
said
henry
with
the
confidence
he
knew
so
well
how
to
use
with
certain
people
and
on
certain
occasions
with
monsieur
de
mouy
such
things
are
not
even
asked
for
you
are
right
sire
replied
the
young
man
but
i
need
your
word
for
i
shall
have
to
tell
the
leaders
that
i
have
it
you
are
not
a
catholic
are
you
henry
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
do
not
renounce
the
kingdom
of
navarre
i
renounce
no
kingdom
de
mouy
i
merely
reserve
for
myself
the
choice
of
the
best
that
is
the
one
which
shall
best
suit
me
and
you
and
if
in
the
meantime
your
majesty
should
be
arrested
you
would
promise
to
reveal
nothing
even
should
they
torture
your
royal
majesty
de
mouy
i
swear
that
before
god
one
further
word
sire
how
am
i
to
see
you
in
future
after
you
shall
have
a
key
to
my
room
you
will
come
there
de
mouy
as
often
as
it
may
be
necessary
and
when
you
please
it
is
for
the
duc
to
answer
for
your
presence
in
the
louvre
in
the
meantime
use
the
small
stairway
i
will
show
you
the
way
the
queen
will
have
the
cloak
like
yours
come
here
the
one
who
was
in
the
antechamber
just
now
no
one
must
notice
any
difference
between
you
or
know
that
there
are
two
of
you
de
mouy
do
you
not
agree
with
me
and
you
madame
henry
looked
at
marguerite
and
uttered
the
last
words
with
a
smile
yes
said
she
without
moving
a
feature
for
this
monsieur
de
la
mole
belongs
to
my
brother
the
duke
well
madame
try
to
win
him
over
to
our
side
said
henry
in
perfect
seriousness
spare
neither
gold
nor
promises
i
will
put
all
my
treasures
at
his
disposal
in
that
case
said
marguerite
with
one
of
the
smiles
which
belong
only
to
the
women
of
boccaccio
since
this
is
your
wish
i
will
do
my
best
to
second
it
very
good
madame
and
you
de
mouy
return
to
the
duke
and
make
sure
of
him
chapter
xxvi
margarita
during
the
conversation
which
we
have
just
related
la
mole
and
coconnas
mounted
guard
la
mole
somewhat
chagrined
coconnas
somewhat
anxious
la
mole
had
had
time
to
reflect
and
in
this
he
had
been
greatly
aided
by
coconnas
what
do
you
think
of
all
this
my
friend
la
mole
had
asked
of
coconnas
i
think
the
piedmontese
had
replied
that
there
is
some
court
intrigue
connected
with
it
and
such
being
the
case
are
you
disposed
to
play
a
part
in
it
my
dear
fellow
replied
coconnas
listen
well
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
and
try
and
profit
by
it
in
all
these
princely
dealings
in
all
royal
affairs
we
can
and
should
be
nothing
but
shadows
where
the
king
of
navarre
leaves
a
bit
of
his
plume
and
the
duc
a
piece
of
his
cloak
we
leave
our
lives
the
queen
has
a
fancy
for
you
and
you
for
her
nothing
is
better
lose
your
head
in
love
my
dear
fellow
but
not
in
politics
that
was
wise
council
therefore
it
was
heard
by
la
mole
with
the
melancholy
of
a
man
who
feels
that
placed
between
reason
and
madness
it
is
madness
he
will
follow
i
have
not
a
fancy
for
the
queen
annibal
i
love
her
and
fortunately
or
unfortunately
i
love
her
with
all
my
heart
this
is
madness
you
will
say
well
i
admit
that
i
am
mad
but
you
are
wise
coconnas
you
ought
not
to
suffer
for
my
foolishness
and
my
misfortune
go
back
to
our
master
and
do
not
compromise
yourself
coconnas
pondered
an
instant
then
raising
his
head
my
dear
fellow
he
replied
all
that
you
tell
me
is
perfectly
reasonable
you
are
in
love
act
therefore
like
a
lover
i
am
ambitious
and
being
so
i
think
life
is
worth
more
to
me
than
a
kiss
when
i
risk
my
life
i
make
my
own
conditions
try
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
my
poor
medor
to
make
yours
whereupon
coconnas
extended
his
hand
to
la
mole
and
withdrew
having
exchanged
a
final
glance
and
a
final
smile
with
his
friend
about
ten
minutes
after
he
left
his
post
the
door
opened
and
marguerite
peering
out
cautiously
took
la
mole
by
the
hand
and
without
uttering
a
word
drew
him
from
the
corridor
into
the
furthest
corner
of
her
room
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
with
a
care
which
indicated
the
importance
of
the
conversation
she
was
about
to
have
once
in
her
room
she
stopped
seated
herself
on
her
ebony
chair
and
drawing
la
mole
to
her
she
clasped
her
hands
over
both
of
his
now
that
we
are
alone
said
she
let
us
talk
seriously
my
very
dear
friend
seriously
madame
said
la
mole
or
lovingly
does
that
please
you
better
but
there
can
be
serious
things
in
love
and
especially
in
the
love
of
a
queen
then
let
us
talk
of
serious
things
but
on
condition
that
your
majesty
will
not
be
vexed
at
the
lighter
things
i
have
to
say
to
you
i
shall
be
vexed
only
at
one
thing
la
mole
and
that
is
if
you
address
me
as
or
majesty
for
you
my
beloved
i
am
just
marguerite
yes
marguerite
yes
margarita
yes
my
pearl
cried
the
young
man
devouring
the
queen
with
his
eyes
yes
that
is
right
said
marguerite
so
you
are
jealous
my
fine
gentleman
oh
unreasonably
still
madly
marguerite
jealous
of
whom
come
of
everyone
but
really
of
the
king
first
i
should
think
after
what
you
had
seen
and
heard
you
might
be
easy
on
that
point
of
this
monsieur
de
mouy
whom
i
saw
this
morning
for
the
first
time
and
whom
this
evening
i
find
so
far
advanced
in
his
intimacy
with
you
monsieur
de
mouy
yes
who
gave
you
such
ideas
about
monsieur
de
mouy
listen
i
recognized
him
from
his
figure
from
the
color
of
his
hair
from
a
natural
feeling
of
hatred
he
is
the
one
who
was
with
monsieur
this
morning
well
what
connection
has
that
with
me
monsieur
is
your
brother
it
is
said
that
you
are
very
fond
of
him
you
may
have
confided
to
him
a
vague
feeling
of
your
heart
and
according
to
the
custom
at
court
he
has
aided
your
wish
by
admitting
monsieur
de
mouy
to
your
apartment
now
what
i
do
not
understand
is
how
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
king
here
at
the
same
time
but
in
any
case
madame
be
frank
with
me
in
default
of
other
sentiment
a
love
like
mine
has
the
right
to
demand
frankness
in
return
see
i
prostrate
myself
at
your
feet
if
what
you
have
felt
for
me
is
but
a
passing
fancy
i
will
give
you
back
your
trust
your
promise
your
love
i
will
give
back
to
monsieur
his
kind
favors
and
my
post
of
gentleman
and
i
will
go
and
seek
death
at
the
siege
of
la
rochelle
if
love
does
not
kill
me
before
i
have
gone
as
far
as
that
marguerite
listened
smilingly
to
these
charming
words
watching
la
mole
graceful
gestures
then
leaning
her
beautiful
dreamy
head
on
her
feverish
hand
you
love
me
she
asked
oh
madame
more
than
life
more
than
safety
more
than
all
but
you
you
you
do
not
love
me
poor
fool
she
murmured
ah
yes
madame
cried
la
mole
still
at
her
feet
i
have
told
you
i
was
that
the
chief
thought
of
your
life
then
is
your
love
dear
la
mole
it
is
the
only
thought
madame
the
sole
thought
well
be
it
so
i
will
make
of
all
the
rest
only
an
accessory
to
this
love
you
love
me
do
you
wish
to
remain
near
me
my
one
prayer
is
that
god
will
never
take
me
from
you
well
you
shall
not
leave
me
i
need
you
la
mole
you
need
me
does
the
sun
need
the
if
i
will
tell
you
that
i
love
you
would
you
be
wholly
devoted
to
me
ah
am
i
not
that
already
madame
and
more
than
wholly
yes
but
god
forgive
me
you
still
doubt
oh
i
am
wrong
i
am
ungrateful
or
rather
as
i
have
told
you
and
repeated
to
you
i
am
a
fool
but
why
was
monsieur
de
mouy
with
you
this
evening
why
did
i
see
him
this
morning
with
monsieur
le
duc
why
that
cloak
that
white
plume
that
affected
imitation
of
my
gait
ah
madame
it
is
not
you
whom
i
suspect
but
your
brother
wretched
man
said
marguerite
wretched
man
to
suppose
that
duc
françois
would
push
complacency
so
far
as
to
introduce
a
wooer
to
his
sister
room
mad
enough
to
be
jealous
and
yet
not
to
have
guessed
do
you
know
la
mole
that
the
duc
would
run
you
through
with
his
own
sword
if
he
knew
that
you
were
here
this
evening
at
my
feet
and
that
instead
of
sending
you
away
i
were
saying
to
you
here
where
you
are
la
mole
for
i
love
you
my
fine
gentleman
do
you
hear
i
love
you
ah
yes
he
would
certainly
kill
you
great
god
cried
la
mole
starting
back
and
looking
at
marguerite
in
terror
is
it
possible
everything
is
possible
my
friend
in
these
times
and
at
this
court
now
one
word
it
was
not
for
me
that
monsieur
de
mouy
in
your
cloak
his
face
hidden
under
your
hat
came
to
the
louvre
it
was
for
monsieur
but
i
thinking
it
was
you
brought
him
here
he
knows
our
secret
la
mole
and
must
be
carefully
managed
i
should
prefer
to
kill
him
said
la
mole
that
is
shorter
and
surer
and
i
my
brave
gentleman
said
the
queen
i
prefer
him
to
live
and
for
you
to
know
everything
for
not
only
is
his
life
useful
to
us
but
it
is
necessary
listen
and
weigh
your
words
well
before
you
answer
do
you
love
me
enough
la
mole
to
be
glad
if
i
were
really
to
become
a
queen
that
is
queen
of
a
real
kingdom
alas
madame
i
love
you
enough
to
wish
what
you
wish
even
should
this
desire
ruin
my
whole
life
well
do
you
want
to
aid
me
to
realize
this
desire
which
would
make
you
still
happier
oh
i
should
lose
you
madame
cried
la
mole
hiding
his
head
in
his
hands
no
on
the
contrary
instead
of
being
the
first
of
my
servants
you
would
become
the
first
of
my
subjects
that
is
all
oh
no
interest
no
ambition
madame
do
not
sully
the
feeling
i
have
for
you
the
devotion
nothing
but
devotion
noble
nature
said
marguerite
well
yes
i
accept
your
devotion
and
i
shall
find
out
how
to
reward
it
she
extended
both
her
hands
and
la
mole
covered
them
with
kisses
well
said
she
well
yes
replied
la
mole
yes
marguerite
i
am
beginning
to
comprehend
this
vague
project
already
talked
of
by
us
huguenots
before
the
massacre
of
saint
bartholomew
the
scheme
for
the
execution
of
which
i
like
many
another
worthier
than
myself
was
sent
to
paris
you
covet
this
actual
kingdom
of
navarre
which
is
to
take
the
place
of
an
imaginary
kingdom
king
henry
drives
you
to
it
de
mouy
conspires
with
you
does
he
not
but
the
duc
what
is
he
doing
in
it
all
where

the
duc

friend
to
aid
you
in
all
this

asking
anything
in
exchange
for
the
danger
he
runs

duke
my
friend
is
conspiring
on
his
own
account
let
us
leave
him
to
his
illusions

life

for
ours
but
i
who
belong
to
him
can
i
betray
him
betray
him
in
what
are
you
betraying
him
what
has
he
confided
to
you
is
it
not
he
who
has
betrayed
you
by
giving
your
cloak
and
hat
to
de
mouy
as
a
means
of
gaining
him
admittance
to
his
apartments
you
belong
to
him
you
say
were
you
not
mine
my
gentleman
before
you
were
his
has
he
given
you
a
greater
proof
of
friendship
than
the
proof
of
love
you
have
from
me
la
mole
arose
pale
and
completely
overcome
oh
he
murmured
coconnas
was
right
intrigue
is
enveloping
me
in
its
folds
it
will
suffocate
me
well
asked
marguerite
well
said
la
mole
this
is
my
answer
it
is
said
and
i
heard
it
at
the
other
end
of
france
where
your
illustrious
name
and
your
universal
reputation
for
beauty
touched
my
heart
like
a
vague
desire
for
the
unknown
it
is
said
that
sometimes
you
love
but
that
your
love
is
always
fatal
to
those
you
love
so
that
death
jealous
no
doubt
almost
always
removes
your
lovers
la
mole
do
not
interrupt
me
oh
my
margarita
for
they
add
that
you
preserve
the
hearts
of
these
faithful
friends
in
gold
boxes
and
that
occasionally
you
bestow
a
melancholy
thought
a
pious
glance
on
the
sad
remains
you
sigh
my
queen
your
eyes
droop
it
is
true
well
make
me
the
dearest
and
the
happiest
of
your
favorites
you
have
pierced
the
hearts
of
others
and
you
keep
their
hearts
you
do
more
with
me
you
expose
my
head
well
marguerite
swear
to
me
before
the
image
of
the
god
who
has
saved
my
life
in
this
very
place
swear
to
me
that
if
i
die
for
you
as
a
sad
presentiment
tells
me
i
shall
do
swear
to
me
that
you
will
keep
my
head
which
the
hangman
will
separate
from
my
body
and
that
you
will
sometimes
press
your
lips
to
it
swear
marguerite
and
the
promise
of
such
reward
bestowed
by
my
queen
will
make
me
silent
and
if
necessary
a
traitor
and
a
coward
this
is
being
wholly
devoted
as
your
lover
and
your
accomplice
should
be
oh
what
ghastly
foolishness

heart
said
marguerite

fatal

fine
gentleman
on
this
cross

to
you
that
you
shall
be
near
me
living
or

so
long
as

if
i
am
unable
to
rescue
you
from
the
peril
which
comes
to
you
through
me
through
me
alone
i
will
at
least
give
to
your
poor
soul
the
consolation

so
well

one
word
more
marguerite

live
too
for

may
succeed
the
king
of
navarre
king
you
may
be
queen
in
which
case
he
will
take
you
away

vow
of
separation
between
you

some
day
be
broken
and
will
do
away
with

marguerite
my
marguerite
with
a
word

every
fear

a
word

courage

cried
marguerite
again
raising
her
hand
to
the
cross
on
the
little
chest
if
i
leave
you
follow
and
if
the
king
refuses
to
take
you
then
i
shall
not
go
but
you
dare
not
resist
my
hyacinthe
said
marguerite
you
do
not
know
henry
at
present
he
is
thinking
of
only
one
thing
that
is
of
being
king
for
this
he
would
sacrifice
everything
he
owns
and
still
more
what
he
does
not
own
now
adieu
madame
said
la
mole
smiling
are
you
going
to
send
me
away
it
is
late
said
marguerite
no
doubt
but
where
would
you
have
me
go
monsieur
de
mouy
is
in
my
room
with
monsieur
le
duc
ah
yes
said
marguerite
with
a
beautiful
smile
besides
i
have
still
some
things
to
tell
you
about
this
conspiracy
from
that
night
la
mole
was
no
longer
an
ordinary
favorite
he
well
might
carry
his
head
high
for
which
living
or
dead
so
sweet
a
future
was
in
store
and
yet
at
times
his
weary
brow
was
bent
his
cheek
grew
pale
and
deep
thoughts
ploughed
their
furrows
on
the
forehead
of
the
young
man
once
so
now
so
happy
chapter
xxvii
the
hand
of
god
on
leaving
madame
de
sauve
henry
had
said
to
her
go
to
bed
charlotte
pretend
that
you
are
very
ill
and
on
no
account
see
any
one
all
day
charlotte
obeyed
without
questioning
the
reason
for
this
suggestion
from
the
king
she
was
beginning
to
be
accustomed
to
his
eccentricities
as
we
should
call
them
or
to
his
whims
as
they
were
then
called
moreover
she
knew
that
deep
in
his
heart
henry
hid
secrets
which
he
told
to
no
one
in
his
mind
plans
which
he
feared
to
reveal
even
in
his
dreams
so
that
she
carried
out
all
his
wishes
knowing
that
his
most
peculiar
ideas
had
an
object
whereupon
that
evening
she
complained
to
dariole
of
great
heaviness
in
her
head
accompanied
by
dizziness
these
were
the
symptoms
which
henry
had
suggested
to
her
to
feign
the
following
day
she
pretended
that
she
wanted
to
rise
but
scarcely
had
she
put
her
foot
on
the
floor
when
she
said
she
felt
a
general
debility
and
went
back
to
bed
this
indisposition
which
henry
had
already
announced
to
the
duc
was
the
first
news
brought
to
catharine
when
she
calmly
asked
why
la
sauve
was
not
present
as
usual
at
her
levee
she
is
ill
replied
madame
de
lorraine
who
was
there
ill
repeated
catharine
without
a
muscle
of
her
face
betraying
the
interest
she
took
in
the
answer
some
idle
fatigue
perhaps
no
madame
replied
the
princess
she
complains
of
a
severe
headache
and
of
weakness
which
prevents
her
from
walking
catharine
did
not
answer
but
to
hide
her
joy
she
turned
to
the
window
and
perceiving
henry
who
was
crossing
the
court
after
his
conversation
with
de
mouy
she
rose
the
better
to
see
him
driven
by
that
conscience
which
although
invisible
always
throbs
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
hearts
most
hardened
to
crime
does
not
my
son
henry
seem
paler
than
usual
this
morning
she
asked
her
captain
of
the
guards
there
was
nothing
in
the
question
henry
was
greatly
troubled
mentally
but
physically
he
was
very
strong
by
degrees
those
usually
present
at
the
queen
levee
withdrew
three
or
four
intimate
ones
remained
longer
than
the
others
but
catharine
impatiently
dismissed
them
saying
that
she
wished
to
be
alone
when
the
last
courtier
had
gone
catharine
closed
the
door
and
going
to
a
secret
closet
hidden
in
one
of
the
panels
of
her
room
she
slid
back
a
door
in
a
groove
of
wood
and
took
out
a
book
the
worn
leaves
of
which
showed
frequent
use
placing
the
volume
on
a
table
she
opened
it
to
a
then
resting
her
elbow
on
the
table
and
her
head
on
one
hand
that
is
it
murmured
she
reading
general
weakness
pain
in
the
eyes
swelling
of
the
palate
as
yet
they
have
mentioned
only
the
pains
in
the
head
and
weakness
but
the
other
symptoms
will
not
be
slow
in
forthcoming
she
continued
the
inflammation
reaches
the
throat
extends
to
the
stomach
surrounds
the
heart
like
a
circle
of
fire
and
causes
the
brain
to
burst
like
a
thunderclap
she
read
on
to
herself
then
in
a
low
voice
for
the
fever
six
hours
for
the
general
inflammation
twelve
hours
for
the
gangrene
twelve
hours
for
the
suffering
six
hours
in
all
hours
now
suppose
that
the
absorption
is
slow
and
that
instead
of
hours
we
have
forty
even
yes
hours
should
suffice
but
henry
how
is
it
that
he
is
still
up
because
he
is
a
man
because
he
has
a
strong
constitution
because
perhaps
he
drank
after
he
kissed
her
and
wiped
his
lips
after
drinking
catharine
awaited
the
dinner
hour
with
impatience
henry
dined
every
day
at
the
king
table
he
came
he
in
turn
complained
of
pain
in
his
head
he
ate
nothing
and
withdrew
immediately
after
the
meal
saying
that
having
been
awake
a
part
of
the
previous
night
he
felt
a
pressing
need
of
sleep
catharine
listened
as
his
uncertain
steps
died
away
then
she
had
him
followed
she
was
told
that
the
king
of
navarre
had
gone
to
madame
de
sauve
apartments
henry
said
she
to
herself
will
this
evening
complete
the
work
of
death
which
some
unfortunate
chance
has
left
half
finished
the
king
of
navarre
had
indeed
gone
to
madame
de
sauve
room
but
it
was
to
tell
her
to
continue
playing
her
rôle
the
whole
of
the
following
morning
henry
did
not
leave
his
chamber
nor
did
he
appear
at
dinner
madame
de
sauve
they
said
was
growing
worse
and
worse
and
the
report
of
henry
illness
spread
abroad
by
catharine
herself
sped
like
one
of
those
presentiments
which
hover
in
the
air
but
which
no
one
can
explain
catharine
was
delighted
the
previous
morning
she
had
sent
ambroise
paré
to
help
one
of
her
favorite
servants
who
was
ill
at
saint
germain
so
it
had
to
be
one
of
her
own
men
who
was
called
in
to
see
madame
de
sauve
and
henry
this
man
would
say
only
what
she
wished
him
to
say
if
contrary
to
all
expectation
some
other
doctor
had
been
summoned
and
if
some
whisper
concerning
poison
had
frightened
the
court
in
which
so
many
such
reports
had
already
been
circulated
she
counted
greatly
on
the
rumor
to
arouse
the
jealousy
of
marguerite
regarding
the
various
loves
of
her
husband
we
remember
she
had
spoken
strongly
of
this
jealousy
which
had
been
apparent
on
various
occasions
among
others
on
the
hawthorn
walk
where
in
the
presence
of
several
persons
she
had
said
to
her
daughter
so
you
are
very
jealous
marguerite
therefore
with
unruffled
features
she
waited
for
the
door
to
open
when
some
pale
startled
servant
would
enter
crying
your
majesty
the
king
of
navarre
has
been
hurt
and
madame
de
sauve
is
dead
four
in
the
afternoon
struck
catharine
finished
her
luncheon
in
the
aviary
where
she
was
crumbling
some
bread
for
her
rare
birds
which
she
herself
had
raised
although
her
face
was
calm
and
even
gloomy
as
usual
her
heart
throbbed
violently
at
the
slightest
sound
suddenly
the
door
opened
madame
said
the
captain
of
the
guards
the
king
of
navarre
is
ill
hastily
interrupted
catharine
no
madame
thank
god
his
majesty
seems
to
be
wonderfully
well
what
is
it
then
the
king
of
navarre
is
here
what
does
he
want
he
is
bringing
your
majesty
a
rare
kind
of
monkey
just
then
henry
entered
holding
in
his
hand
a
basket
in
which
was
a
little
monkey
he
was
petting
he
entered
smiling
and
seemed
wholly
absorbed
in
the
dear
little
animal
he
brought
but
occupied
as
he
appeared
to
be
he
did
not
fail
to
give
his
usual
first
glance
around
this
was
sufficient
for
him
under
trying
circumstances
as
to
catharine
she
was
very
pale
of
a
pallor
which
deepened
as
she
saw
that
the
cheeks
of
the
young
man
were
flushed
with
the
glow
of
health
the
queen
mother
was
amazed
at
this
turn
of
affairs
she
accepted
henry
gift
mechanically
appeared
agitated
complimented
him
on
looking
so
well
and
added
i
am
all
the
more
pleased
to
see
you
looking
so
because
i
heard
that
you
were
ill
and
because
if
i
remember
rightly
you
yourself
complained
of
not
feeling
well
in
my
presence
but
i
understand
now
she
added
trying
to
smile
it
was
an
excuse
so
that
you
might
be
free
no
i
have
really
been
very
ill
madame
said
henry
but
a
specific
used
in
our
mountains
and
which
comes
from
my
mother
has
cured
my
indisposition
ah
you
will
give
me
the
recipe
will
you
not
henry
said
catharine
really
smiling
this
time
but
with
an
irony
she
could
not
disguise
some
she
murmured
we
must
look
into
this
but
no
seeing
madame
de
sauve
ill
it
will
be
suspected
indeed
i
believe
that
the
hand
of
god
is
over
this
man
catharine
waited
impatiently
for
the
night
madame
de
sauve
did
not
appear
at
play
she
inquired
for
her
but
was
told
that
she
was
suffering
more
and
more
all
the
evening
she
was
restless
and
everyone
anxiously
wondered
what
were
the
thoughts
which
could
move
this
face
usually
so
calm
at
length
everyone
retired
catharine
had
herself
undressed
and
put
to
bed
by
her
then
when
everyone
had
gone
to
sleep
in
the
louvre
she
rose
slipped
on
a
long
black
took
a
lamp
chose
from
her
keys
the
one
which
unlocked
the
door
of
madame
de
sauve
apartments
and
ascended
the
stairs
to
see
her
had
henry
foreseen
this
visit
was
he
busy
in
his
own
rooms
was
he
hiding
somewhere
however
this
may
have
been
the
young
woman
was
alone
catharine
opened
the
door
cautiously
crossed
the
antechamber
entered
the
set
her
lamp
on
a
table
for
a
night
lamp
was
burning
near
the
sick
woman
and
glided
like
a
shadow
into
the
dariole
in
a
deep
armchair
was
sleeping
near
the
bed
of
her
mistress
this
bed
was
entirely
shut
in
by
curtains
the
respiration
of
the
young
woman
was
so
light
that
for
an
instant
catharine
thought
she
was
not
breathing
at
all
at
length
she
heard
a
slight
sigh
and
with
an
evil
joy
she
raised
the
curtain
in
order
to
see
for
herself
the
effect
of
the
terrible
poison
she
trembled
in
advance
at
the
sight
of
the
livid
pallor
or
the
devouring
purple
of
the
mortal
fever
she
hoped
for
but
instead
of
this
calm
with
eyes
hidden
under
their
white
lids
her
mouth
rosy
and
half
open
her
moist
cheek
pressed
gently
against
one
of
her
gracefully
rounded
arms
while
the
other
arm
fresh
and
pearly
was
thrown
across
the
crimson
damask
which
served
as
counterpane
the
beautiful
young
woman
lay
sleeping
with
a
smile
still
on
her
lips
no
doubt
some
sweet
dream
brought
the
smile
to
her
lips
and
to
her
cheek
the
flush
of
health
which
nothing
could
disturb
catharine
could
not
refrain
from
uttering
a
cry
of
surprise
which
roused
dariole
for
a
moment
the
queen
mother
hastily
stepped
behind
the
curtains
of
the
bed
dariole
opened
her
eyes
but
overcome
with
sleep
without
even
wondering
in
her
drowsy
mind
why
she
had
wakened
the
young
girl
dropped
her
heavy
lids
and
slept
again
then
catharine
came
from
behind
the
curtain
and
glancing
at
the
other
objects
in
the
room
saw
on
a
table
a
bottle
of
spanish
wine
some
fruit
pastry
and
two
glasses
henry
must
have
had
supper
with
the
baroness
who
apparently
was
as
well
as
himself
walking
on
tiptoe
catharine
took
up
the
small
silver
box
that
was
partly
empty
it
was
the
same
or
very
similar
to
the
one
she
had
sent
to
charlotte
she
removed
from
it
a
piece
as
large
as
a
pearl
on
the
point
of
a
gold
needle
returned
to
her
room
and
gave
it
to
the
little
ape
which
henry
had
brought
her
that
evening
attracted
by
the
aromatic
odor
the
animal
devoured
it
eagerly
and
turning
around
in
his
basket
went
to
sleep
catharine
waited
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
half
of
what
he
has
just
eaten
said
she
my
dog
brutus
died
swelling
up
instantly
some
one
has
played
me
a
trick
is
it
réné
impossible
then
it
is
henry
o
fatality
it
is
very
evident
that
since
he
is
to
reign
he
can
not
die
but
perhaps
the
poison
was
not
strong
enough
we
shall
see
by
trying
steel
and
catharine
went
to
bed
revolving
in
her
mind
a
fresh
idea
which
no
doubt
was
perfected
the
following
day
for
she
called
her
captain
of
the
guards
to
her
gave
him
a
letter
ordered
him
to
take
it
to
its
address
and
to
deliver
it
only
into
the
hands
of
the
one
for
whom
it
was
intended
it
was
addressed
to
the
sire
de
louvièrs
de
maurevel
captain
of
the
king

chapter
xxviii
the
letter
from
rome
several
days
elapsed
after
the
events
we
have
just
described
when
one
morning
a
litter
escorted
by
several
gentlemen
wearing
the
colors
of
monsieur
de
guise
entered
the
louvre
and
word
was
brought
to
the
queen
of
navarre
that
madame
la
duchesse
de
nevers
begged
the
honor
of
an
audience
marguerite
was
receiving
a
call
from
madame
de
sauve
it
was
the
first
time
the
beautiful
baroness
had
been
out
since
her
pretended
illness
she
knew
that
the
queen
had
expressed
to
her
husband
great
anxiety
on
account
of
her
indisposition
which
for
almost
a
week
had
been
court
gossip
and
she
had
come
to
thank
her
marguerite
congratulated
her
on
her
convalescence
and
on
her
good
fortune
at
having
recovered
so
quickly
from
the
strange
malady
the
seriousness
of
which
as
a
daughter
of
france
she
could
not
fail
to
appreciate
i
trust
you
will
attend
the
hunt
already
once
postponed
said
marguerite
it
is
planned
positively
for
for
winter
the
weather
is
very
mild
the
sun
has
softened
the
earth
and
the
hunters
all
say
that
the
day
will
be
fine
but
madame
said
the
baroness
i
do
not
know
if
i
shall
be
strong
enough
bah
exclaimed
marguerite
make
an
effort
moreover
since
i
am
one
of
the
hunters
i
have
told
the
king
to
reserve
a
small
béarnese
horse
which
i
was
to
ride
but
which
will
carry
you
perfectly
have
you
not
already
heard
of
it
yes
madame
but
i
did
not
know
that
it
was
meant
for
your
majesty
had
i
known
that
i
should
not
have
accepted
it
from
a
feeling
of
pride
baroness
no
madame
from
a
feeling
of
humility
on
the
contrary
then
you
will
come
your
majesty
overwhelms
me
with
honor
i
will
come
since
you
command
me
at
that
moment
madame
la
duchesse
de
nevers
was
announced
at
this
name
marguerite
gave
a
cry
of
such
delight
that
the
baroness
understood
that
the
two
women
wanted
to
talk
together
she
rose
to
leave
until
then
said
marguerite
until
madame
by
the
way
continued
marguerite
holding
the
baroness
by
the
hand
you
know
that
in
public
i
hate
you
for
i
am
horribly
jealous
of
you
but
in
private
asked
madame
de
sauve
oh
in
private
not
only
do
i
forgive
you
but
more
than
that
i
thank
you
then
your
majesty
will
permit
me
marguerite
held
out
her
hand
the
baroness
kissed
it
respectfully
made
a
low
courtesy
and
went
out
while
madame
de
sauve
ascended
her
stairway
bounding
like
a
deer
whose
tether
has
been
broken
madame
de
nevers
was
exchanging
a
few
formal
words
with
the
queen
which
gave
time
to
the
gentlemen
who
had
accompanied
her
to
retire
gillonne
cried
marguerite
when
the
door
was
closed
behind
the
last
gillonne
see
that
no
one
interrupts
us
yes
said
the
duchess
for
we
have
matters
of
grave
importance
to
discuss
taking
a
chair
she
seated
herself
without
ceremony
in
the
best
place
near
the
fire
and
in
the
sunlight
sure
that
no
one
would
interrupt
the
pleasant
intimacy
between
herself
and
the
queen
of
navarre
well
said
marguerite
with
a
smile
what
about
our
famous
slaughterer
my
dear
queen
said
the
duchess
he
is
a
mythological
creature
upon
my
word
he
is
incomparable
so
far
as
his
mind
is
concerned
and
never
dries
up
he
makes
witty
remarks
that
would
make
a
saint
in
her
shrine
die
of
laughing
in
other
respects
he
is
the
maddest
heathen
who
ever
walked
in
the
skin
of
a
catholic
i
dote
on
him
and
you
what
are
you
doing
with
your
apollo
alas
said
marguerite
with
a
sigh
oh
how
that
frightens
me
dear
queen
is
the
gentle
la
mole
too
respectful
or
too
sentimental
in
that
i
am
forced
to
admit
he
would
be
exactly
the
opposite
of
his
friend
coconnas
oh
no
he
has
his
moments
said
marguerite
but
this
concerned
only
myself
what
does
it
mean
then
it
means
dear
duchess
that
i
am
terribly
afraid
i
am
actually
in
love
really
on
my
honor
oh
so
much
the
better
what
a
merry
life
we
can
lead
cried
henriette
to
love
a
little
is
my
dream
to
love
much
is
yours
it
is
so
sweet
dear
and
learned
queen
to
rest
the
mind
by
the
heart
is
it
not
and
to
have
the
smile
after
the
delirium
ah
marguerite
i
have
a
feeling
that
we
are
going
to
have
a
glorious
year
do
you
think
so
said
the
queen
i
on
the
contrary
do
not
know
how
that
may
be
i
see
things
through
a
veil
all
these
politics
occupy
me
so
much
by
the
way
do
you
know
if
your
annibal
is
as
devoted
to
my
brother
as
he
seems
to
be
find
out
for
me
i
must
know
he
devoted
to
anybody
or
anything
it
is
easy
to
see
that
you
do
not
know
him
as
i
do
if
he
ever
is
devoted
to
anything
it
will
be
his
ambition
and
that
is
all
if
your
brother
is
a
man
to
make
great
promises
to
him
well
he
will
be
devoted
to
your
brother
but
let
your
brother
son
of
france
that
he
is
be
careful
not
to
break
the
promises
he
makes
him
if
he
does
my
faith
look
out
for
your
brother
really
it
is
just
as
i
say
truly
marguerite
there
are
times
when
this
tiger
whom
i
have
tamed
frightens
me
the
other
day
i
said
to
him
be
careful
do
not
deceive
me
for
if
you
do
i
said
it
however
with
my
emerald
eyes
which
prompted
ronsard
lines
duchesse
de
nevers
yeux
verts
sous
leur
paupière
sur
nous
plus
ne
font
vingt
les
la
tempête
well
well
i
supposed
he
would
answer
me
deceive
you
i
never
etc
but
do
you
know
what
he
did
answer
no
well
judge
of
the
man
you
he
replied
you
deceive
me
you
take
care
too
for
princess
that
you
are
and
as
he
said
this
he
threatened
me
not
only
with
his
eyes
but
with
his
slender
pointed
finger
with
its
nail
cut
like
a
steel
lance
which
he
held
before
my
nose
at
that
moment
my
poor
queen
i
confess
he
looked
so
fierce
that
i
trembled
and
yet
you
know
i
am
no
coward
he
threatened
you
henriette
he
dared
well
i
had
threatened
him
for
that
matter
he
was
right
so
you
see
he
is
devoted
up
to
a
certain
point
or
rather
to
a
very
uncertain
point
in
that
case
we
shall
see
said
marguerite
thoughtfully
i
will
speak
to
la
mole
have
you
nothing
else
to
tell
me
yes
something
most
interesting
for
which
i
came
but
the
idea
you
have
told
me
more
interesting
things
still
i
have
received
news
from
rome
yes
through
a
courier
from
my
husband
ah
the
poland
affair
it
is
progressing
beautifully
and
probably
in
a
day
or
two
you
will
be
rid
of
your
brother
of
anjou
so
the
pope
has
ratified
his
election
yes
my
dear
and
you
never
told
me
cried
marguerite
well
quick
quick
the
details
oh
mercy
i
have
none
except
those
i
have
given
you
but
wait
i
will
give
you
the
letter
from
monsieur
de
nevers
here
it
is
oh
no
those
are
some
verses
from
annibal
atrocious
ones
too
my
poor
marguerite
he
can
not
write
any
other
kind
but
wait
here
it
is
no
it
is
that
is
a
note
of
my
own
which
i
brought
for
you
to
have
la
mole
give
him
ah
at
last
here
it
is
and
madame
de
nevers
handed
the
letter
to
the
queen
marguerite
opened
it
hastily
and
read
it
but
it
told
nothing
more
than
she
had
already
learned
from
her
friend
how
did
you
receive
this
continued
the
queen
from
a
courier
of
my
husband
who
had
orders
to
stop
at
the
hôtel
de
guise
before
going
to
the
louvre
and
to
deliver
this
letter
to
me
before
delivering
that
of
the
king
i
knew
the
importance
my
queen
would
attach
to
this
news
and
i
had
written
to
monsieur
de
nevers
to
act
thus
he
obeyed
you
see
he
is
not
like
that
monster
of
a
coconnas
now
there
is
no
one
in
the
whole
of
paris
except
the
king
you
and
i
who
knows
this
news
except
the
man
who
followed
our
courier
what
man
oh
the
horrid
business
imagine
how
tired
worn
out
and
dusty
the
wretched
messenger
was
when
he
arrived
he
rode
seven
days
day
and
night
without
stopping
an
instant
but
the
man
you
spoke
of
just
now
wait
a
minute
constantly
followed
by
a
fellow
who
had
relays
like
himself
and
who
rode
as
far
as
he
did
for
the
four
hundred
leagues
the
poor
courier
constantly
expected
to
be
shot
in
his
back
both
reached
the
saint
marcel
gate
at
the
same
time
both
galloped
down
the
rue
mouffetard
both
crossed
the
city
but
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
of
our
courier
turned
to
the
right
while
the
other
took
the
road
to
the
left
by
the
place
du
châtelet
and
sped
along
the
quays
by
the
side
of
the
louvre
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
thanks
my
good
henriette
thanks
cried
marguerite
you
are
right
that
is
very
interesting
news
by
whom
was
the
other
courier
sent
i
must
know
so
leave
me
until
this
evening
rue
tizon
is
it
not
and
the
hunt
do
take
a
frisky
horse
so
that
he
will
run
away
and
we
can
be
by
ourselves
i
will
tell
you
this
evening
what
is
necessary
for
you
to
try
and
find
out
from
your
coconnas
you
will
not
forget
my
letter
said
the
duchess
of
nevers
smiling
no
no
do
not
worry
he
shall
have
it
and
at
once
madame
de
nevers
left
and
marguerite
immediately
sent
for
henry
who
came
to
her
quickly
she
gave
him
the
letter
from
the
duc
de
nevers
oh
oh
he
exclaimed
then
marguerite
told
him
about
the
second
courier
yes
said
henry
i
saw
him
enter
the
louvre
perhaps
he
was
for
the
queen
mother
no
i
am
sure
of
that
for
i
ventured
to
take
my
stand
in
the
corridor
and
i
saw
no
one
pass
then
said
marguerite
looking
at
her
husband
he
must
be
for
your
brother
must
he
not
said
henry
yes
but
how
can
we
be
sure
could
not
one
of
his
two
gentlemen
be
sent
for
said
henry
carelessly
and
through
him
you
are
right
said
marguerite
put
at
her
ease
at
her
suggestion
i
will
send
for
monsieur
de
la
mole
gillonne
gillonne
the
young
girl
appeared
i
must
speak
at
once
with
monsieur
de
la
mole
said
the
queen
try
to
find
him
and
bring
him
here
gillonne
disappeared
henry
seated
himself
before
a
table
on
which
was
a
german
book
containing
engravings
by
albert
durer
which
he
began
to
examine
with
such
close
attention
that
when
la
mole
entered
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
and
did
not
even
raise
his
head
on
his
side
the
young
man
seeing
the
king
with
marguerite
stopped
on
the
threshold
silent
from
surprise
and
pale
from
anxiety
marguerite
went
to
him
monsieur
de
la
mole
said
she
can
you
tell
me
who
is
on
guard
at
monsieur
coconnas
madame
said
la
mole
try
to
find
out
for
me
from
him
if
he
admitted
to
his
master
room
a
man
covered
with
mud
who
apparently
had
a
long
or
hasty
ride
ah
madame
i
fear
he
will
not
tell
me
for
several
days
he
has
been
very
taciturn
indeed
but
by
giving
him
this
note
it
seems
to
me
that
he
will
owe
you
something
in
exchange
from
the
duchess
oh
with
this
note
i
will
try
add
said
marguerite
lowering
her
voice
that
this
note
will
serve
him
as
a
means
of
gaining
entrance
this
evening
to
the
house
you
know
about
and
i
madame
said
la
mole
in
a
low
tone
what
shall
be
mine
give
your
name
that
will
be
enough
give
me
the
note
madame
said
la
mole
with
throbbing
heart
i
will
bring
back
the
answer
he
withdrew
we
shall
know
if
the
duke
has
been
informed
of
the
poland
affair
said
marguerite
calmly
turning
to
her
husband
that
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
really
a
fine
servant
said
the
béarnais
with
his
peculiar
smile
and
by
heaven
i
will
make
his
fortune
chapter
xxix
the
departure
when
on
the
following
day
a
beautiful
sun
red
but
rayless
as
is
apt
to
be
the
case
on
privileged
days
of
winter
rose
behind
the
hills
of
paris
everything
had
already
been
awake
for
two
hours
in
the
court
of
the
louvre
a
magnificent
barbary
horse
nervous
and
spirited
with
limbs
like
those
of
a
stag
on
which
the
veins
crossed
one
another
like
network
pawed
the
ground
pricked
up
his
ears
and
snorted
while
waiting
for
charles
ix
he
was
less
impatient
however
than
his
master
who
detained
by
catharine
had
been
stopped
by
her
in
the
hall
she
had
said
she
wished
to
speak
to
him
on
a
matter
of
importance
both
were
in
the
corridor
with
the
glass
windows
catharine
was
cold
pale
and
quiet
as
usual
charles
ix
fretted
bit
his
nails
and
whipped
his
two
favorite
dogs
the
latter
were
covered
with
cuirasses
of
mail
so
that
the
snout
of
the
wild
boar
should
not
harm
them
and
that
they
might
be
able
to
encounter
the
terrible
animal
with
impunity
a
small
scutcheon
with
the
arms
of
france
had
been
stitched
on
their
breasts
similar
to
those
on
the
breasts
of
the
pages
who
more
than
once
had
envied
the
privileges
of
these
happy
favorites
pay
attention
charles
said
catharine
no
one
but
you
and
i
knows
as
yet
of
the
expected
arrival
of
these
polonais
but
god
forgive
me
the
king
of
navarre
acts
as
if
he
knew
in
spite
of
his
abjuration
which
i
always
mistrust
he
is
in
communication
with
the
huguenots
have
you
noticed
how
often
he
has
gone
out
the
past
few
days
he
has
money
too
he
who
has
never
had
any
he
buys
horses
arms
and
on
rainy
days
he
practises
fencing
from
morning
until
night
well
my
god
mother
exclaimed
charles
impatiently
do
you
think
he
intends
to
kill
me
or
my
brother
in
that
case
he
will
need
a
few
more
lessons
for
yesterday
i
counted
eleven
buttonholes
with
my
foil
on
his
doublet
which
however
had
only
six
and
as
to
my
brother
you
know
that
he
fences
as
well
if
not
better
than
i
do
at
least
so
people
say
listen
charles
continued
catharine
and
do
not
treat
lightly
what
your
mother
tells
you
the
ambassadors
will
arrive
well
you
will
see
as
soon
as
they
are
in
paris
henry
will
do
all
he
can
to
gain
their
attention
he
is
insinuating
he
is
crafty
without
mentioning
his
wife
who
seconds
him
i
know
not
why
and
will
chat
with
them
and
talk
latin
greek
hungarian
and
i
know
not
what
to
them
oh
i
tell
you
charles
and
you
know
that
i
am
not
mistaken
i
tell
you
that
there
is
something
on
foot
just
then
the
clock
struck
and
charles
ix
stopped
listening
to
his
mother
to
count
the
strokes
good
heavens
seven
he
exclaimed
one
hour
before
we
get
off
that
will
make
it
eight
one
hour
to
reach
the
and
to
start
again
we
shall
not
be
able
to
begin
hunting
before
nine
really
mother
you
make
me
lose
a
great
deal
of
time
down
risquetout
great
heavens
down
i
say
you
brigand
and
a
vigorous
blow
of
the
bloody
whip
on
the
mastiff
back
brought
a
howl
of
real
pain
from
the
poor
beast
thoroughly
astonished
at
receiving
punishment
in
exchange
for
a
caress
charles
said
catharine
listen
to
me
in
god
name
and
do
not
leave
to
chance
your
fortune
and
that
of
france
the
hunt
the
hunt
the
hunt
you
cry
why
you
will
have
time
enough
to
hunt
when
your
work
of
king
is
settled
come
now
mother
exclaimed
charles
pale
with
impatience
explain
quickly
for
you
bother
me
to
death
really
there
are
days
when
i
can
not
comprehend
you
he
stopped
beating
his
whip
against
his
boot
catharine
thought
that
the
time
had
come
and
that
it
should
not
be
passed
by
my
son
said
she
we
have
proof
that
de
mouy
has
returned
to
paris
monsieur
de
maurevel
whom
you
are
well
acquainted
with
has
seen
him
this
can
be
only
for
the
king
of
navarre
that
is
enough
i
trust
for
us
to
suspect
him
more
than
ever
come
there
you
go
again
after
my
poor
henriot
you
want
me
to
have
him
killed
do
you
not
oh
no
exiled
but
why
can
you
not
see
that
if
he
were
exiled
he
would
be
much
more
dangerous
than
he
will
ever
be
here
in
the
louvre
under
our
eyes
where
he
can
do
nothing
without
our
knowing
it
at
once
therefore
i
do
not
wish
him
exiled
what
do
you
want
then
tell
me
quickly
i
want
him
to
be
held
in
safe
keeping
while
these
polonais
are
here
in
the
bastille
for
instance
ah
my
faith
no
cried
charles
ix
we
are
going
to
hunt
the
boar
this
morning
and
henry
is
one
of
my
best
men
without
him
the
fun
would
be
spoiled
by
heaven
mother
really
you
do
nothing
but
vex
me
why
my
dear
son
i
did
not
say
this
morning
the
ambassadors
do
not
arrive
until
or
the
day
after
arrest
him
after
your
hunt
this
evening
that
is
a
different
matter
well
we
will
talk
about
it
later
and
see
after
the
hunt
i
will
not
refuse
adieu
come
here
risquetout
is
it
your
turn
to
sulk
now
charles
said
catharine
laying
a
detaining
hand
on
his
arm
at
the
risk
of
a
fresh
explosion
which
might
result
from
this
new
delay
i
think
that
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
sign
the
order
for
arrest
at
once
even
though
it
is
not
to
be
carried
out
until
this
evening
or
sign
write
an
order
look
up
a
seal
for
the
parchment
when
they
are
waiting
for
me
to
go
hunting
i
who
never
keep
anyone
waiting
the
devil
take
the
thought
why
no
i
love
you
too
dearly
to
delay
you
i
arranged
everything
beforehand
step
in
here
and
see
and
catharine
as
agile
as
if
she
were
only
twenty
years
old
pushed
open
a
door
of
her
cabinet
and
pointed
to
an
pen
parchment
the
seal
and
a
lighted
candle
the
king
took
the
parchment
and
read
it
through
hastily
to
arrest
and
conduct
to
the
bastille
our
brother
henry
of
good
that
is
done
he
exclaimed
signing
hurriedly
adieu
mother
he
hastened
from
the
room
followed
by
his
dogs
greatly
pleased
to
have
gotten
rid
of
catharine
so
easily
charles
ix
had
been
waited
for
with
impatience
and
as
his
promptness
in
hunting
matters
was
well
known
every
one
wondered
at
the
delay
so
when
he
finally
appeared
the
hunters
welcomed
him
by
shouts
of
long
live
the
king
the
outriders
by
a
flourish
of
trumpets
the
horses
by
neighing
the
dogs
by
barking
all
this
noise
and
hubbub
brought
a
flush
to
his
pale
cheeks
his
heart
swelled
and
for
a
moment
charles
was
young
and
happy
the
king
scarcely
took
the
time
to
salute
the
brilliant
company
gathered
in
the
he
nodded
to
the
duc
waved
his
hand
to
his
sister
marguerite
passed
henry
without
apparently
seeing
him
and
sprang
upon
the
fiery
barbary
horse
which
started
off
at
once
but
after
curvetting
around
three
or
four
times
he
realized
what
sort
of
a
rider
he
had
to
deal
with
and
quieted
down
the
trumpets
again
sounded
and
the
king
left
the
louvre
followed
by
the
duc
the
king
of
navarre
marguerite
madame
de
nevers
madame
de
sauve
tavannes
and
the
principal
courtiers
it
goes
without
saying
that
la
mole
and
coconnas
were
of
the
number
as
to
the
duc
he
had
been
at
the
siege
of
la
rochelle
for
three
months
while
waiting
for
the
king
henry
had
spoken
to
his
wife
who
in
returning
his
greeting
had
whispered
the
courier
from
rome
was
admitted
by
monsieur
de
coconnas
himself
to
the
chamber
of
the
duc
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
messenger
from
the
duc
de
nevers
saw
the
king
then
he
knows
all
said
henry
he
must
know
all
replied
marguerite
but
keep
your
eyes
on
him
and
see
how
in
spite
of
his
usual
dissimulation
his
eyes
shine
saint
gris
murmured
the
béarnais
i
should
think
they
would
he
hunts
triple
game
france
poland
and
navarre
without
counting
the
wild
boar
he
bowed
to
his
wife
returned
to
his
place
and
calling
one
of
his
servants
whose
ancestors
had
been
in
the
service
of
his
father
for
more
than
a
century
and
whom
he
employed
as
ordinary
messenger
in
his
love
affairs
orthon
said
he
take
this
key
to
the
cousin
of
madame
de
sauve
who
you
know
lives
with
his
mistress
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
quatre
fils
say
to
him
that
his
cousin
desires
to
speak
to
him
this
evening
that
he
is
to
enter
my
room
and
in
case
i
am
not
there
to
wait
for
me
if
i
am
late
he
is
to
lie
down
on
my
bed
is
there
an
answer
sire
no
except
to
tell
me
if
you
find
him
the
key
is
for
him
alone
you
understand
yes
sire
wait
do
not
start
now
plague
you
before
leaving
paris
i
will
call
you
to
tighten
my
in
that
way
you
will
naturally
have
to
lag
behind
and
you
can
carry
out
your
commission
and
join
us
at
bondy
the
servant
made
a
sign
of
obedience
and
rode
away
they
set
out
by
the
rue
saint
honoré
through
the
rue
saint
denis
and
the
faubourg
at
the
rue
saint
laurent
the
of
the
king
of
navarre
became
loose
orthon
rode
up
to
him
and
everything
happened
as
had
been
agreed
on
between
him
and
his
master
who
followed
the
royal
procession
along
the
rue
des
récollets
where
his
faithful
servant
sought
the
rue
du
temple
when
henry
overtook
the
king
charles
was
engaged
in
such
an
interesting
conversation
with
the
duc
on
the
subject
of
the
weather
the
age
of
the
wild
boar
which
was
a
recluse
and
as
to
where
he
had
made
his
lair
that
he
did
not
notice
or
pretended
he
did
not
notice
that
henry
had
lagged
behind
a
moment
in
the
meantime
marguerite
had
watched
each
countenance
from
afar
and
thought
she
perceived
a
certain
embarrassment
in
the
eyes
of
her
brother
every
time
she
looked
at
him
madame
de
nevers
was
abandoning
herself
to
mad
gayety
for
coconnas
supremely
happy
that
day
was
making
numberless
jokes
near
her
to
make
the
ladies
laugh
as
to
la
mole
he
had
already
twice
found
an
opportunity
to
kiss
marguerite
white
scarf
with
gold
fringe
without
the
act
which
was
carried
out
with
the
skill
usual
to
lovers
having
been
seen
by
more
than
three
or
four
about
a
eight
they
reached
bondy
the
first
thought
of
charles
ix
was
to
find
out
if
the
wild
boar
had
held
out
the
boar
was
in
his
lair
and
the
outrider
who
had
turned
him
aside
answered
for
him
a
breakfast
was
ready
the
king
drank
a
glass
of
hungarian
wine
charles
ix
invited
the
ladies
to
take
seats
at
table
and
in
his
impatience
to
pass
away
the
time
set
out
to
visit
the
kennels
and
the
roosts
giving
orders
not
to
unsaddle
his
horse
as
he
said
he
had
never
had
a
better
or
a
stronger
mount
while
the
king
was
taking
this
stroll
the
duc
de
guise
arrived
he
was
armed
for
war
rather
than
for
hunting
and
was
accompanied
by
twenty
or
thirty
gentlemen
equipped
in
like
manner
he
asked
at
once
for
the
king
joined
him
and
returned
talking
with
him
at
exactly
nine
the
king
himself
gave
the
signal
to
start
and
each
one
mounted
and
set
out
to
the
meet
during
the
ride
henry
found
another
opportunity
to
be
near
his
wife
well
said
he
do
you
know
anything
new
no
replied
marguerite
unless
it
is
that
my
brother
charles
looks
at
you
strangely
i
have
noticed
it
said
henry
have
you
taken
precautions
i
have
on
a
coat
of
mail
and
at
my
side
a
good
spanish
hunting
knife
as
sharp
as
a
razor
and
as
pointed
as
a
needle
i
could
pierce
pistols
with
it
in
that
case
said
marguerite
god
protect
you
the
outrider
in
charge
of
the
hunt
made
a
sign
they
had
reached
the
lair
chapter
xxx
maurevel
while
all
this
careless
youth
apparently
so
at
least
was
scattering
like
a
gilded
whirlwind
along
the
road
to
bondy
catharine
still
rolling
up
the
precious
parchment
to
which
king
charles
had
just
affixed
his
signature
admitted
into
her
room
a
man
to
whom
a
few
days
before
her
captain
of
the
guards
had
carried
a
letter
addressed
to
rue
de
la
cerisaie
near
the
arsenal
a
broad
silk
band
like
a
badge
of
mourning
hid
one
of
the
man
eyes
showing
only
the
other
eye
two
prominent
and
the
curve
of
a
vulture
nose
while
a
grayish
beard
covered
the
lower
part
of
his
face
he
wore
a
long
thick
cloak
beneath
which
one
might
have
imagined
a
whole
arsenal
besides
this
although
it
was
not
the
custom
of
those
called
to
court
he
wore
at
his
side
a
long
campaign
sword
broad
and
with
a
double
blade
one
of
his
hands
was
hidden
beneath
his
cloak
and
never
left
the
handle
of
a
long
dagger
ah
you
here
monsieur
said
the
queen
seating
herself
you
know
that
i
promised
you
after
saint
bartholomew
when
you
rendered
us
such
signal
service
not
to
let
you
be
idle
the
opportunity
has
arisen
or
rather
i
have
made
it
thank
me
therefore
madame
i
humbly
thank
your
majesty
replied
the
man
with
the
black
bandage
in
a
reserved
voice
at
once
low
and
insolent
a
fine
opportunity
you
will
not
find
another
such
in
your
whole
life
make
the
most
of
it
therefore
i
am
waiting
madame
only
after
the
preamble
i
fear
that
the
commission
may
not
be
much
are
not
those
who
wish
to
advance
fond
of
such
commissions
the
one
of
which
i
speak
would
be
envied
by
the
tavannes
and
even
by
the
de
guises
ah
madame
said
the
man
believe
me
i
am
at
your
majesty
orders
whatever
they
may
be
in
that
case
read
said
catharine
she
handed
him
the
parchment
the
man
read
it
and
grew
pale
what
he
exclaimed
an
order
to
arrest
the
king
of
navarre
well
what
is
there
strange
in
that
but
a
king
madame
really
i
think
i
fear
i
am
not
of
sufficiently
high
rank
my
confidence
makes
you
the
first
gentleman
of
my
court
monsieur
de
maurevel
said
catharine
i
thank
your
majesty
said
the
assassin
so
moved
that
he
seemed
to
hesitate
you
will
obey
then
if
your
majesty
orders
it
is
it
not
my
duty
yes
i
order
it
then
i
will
obey
how
shall
you
go
to
work
why
madame
i
do
not
know
i
should
greatly
like
to
be
guided
by
your
majesty
you
fear
noise
i
admit
it
take
a
dozen
sure
men
if
necessary
i
understand
of
course
that
your
majesty
will
permit
me
to
do
the
best
i
can
for
myself
and
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
this
but
where
shall
i
arrest
the
king
of
navarre
where
would
it
best
please
you
to
arrest
him
in
some
place
in
which
i
should
be
warranted
in
doing
so
if
possible
even
by
his
majesty
yes
i
understand
in
some
royal
palace
what
do
you
say
to
the
louvre
for
instance
oh
if
your
majesty
would
permit
it
that
would
be
a
great
favor
you
will
arrest
him
then
in
the
louvre
in
what
part
in
his
own
room
maurevel
bowed
when
madame
this
evening
or
rather
very
well
madame
now
will
your
majesty
deign
to
inform
me
on
one
point
on
what
point
about
the
respect
due
to
his
position
respect
position
said
catharine
why
then
you
do
not
know
monsieur
that
the
king
of
france
owes
respect
to
no
one
in
his
kingdom
whoever
he
may
be
recognizing
no
position
as
equal
to
his
own
maurevel
bowed
a
second
time
i
insist
on
this
point
however
madame
if
your
majesty
will
allow
me
i
will
monsieur
if
the
king
contests
the
authenticity
of
the
order
which
is
not
probable
but
on
the
contrary
monsieur
he
is
sure
to
do
so
he
will
contest
it
without
a
doubt
and
consequently
he
will
refuse
to
obey
it
i
fear
so
and
he
will
resist
probably
ah
the
devil
said
maurevel
and
in
that
case
in
what
case
said
catharine
not
moving
her
eyes
from
him
why
in
case
he
resists
what
is
to
be
done
what
do
you
do
when
you
are
given
an
order
from
the
king
that
is
when
you
represent
the
king
and
when
there
is
any
resistance
monsieur
de
maurevel
why
madame
said
the
sbirro
when
i
am
honored
with
such
an
order
and
when
this
order
refers
to
a
simple
gentleman
i
kill
him
i
told
you
monsieur
said
catharine
and
i
scarcely
think
that
sufficient
time
has
elapsed
for
you
to
have
forgotten
it
that
the
king
of
france
recognizes
no
position
in
his
kingdom
and
that
after
him
the
greatest
are
simple
gentlemen
maurevel
grew
pale
for
he
was
beginning
to
comprehend
oh
oh
he
cried
kill
the
king
of
navarre
why
who
is
speaking
of
killing
him
where
is
the
order
to
kill
him
the
king
wishes
him
taken
to
the
bastille
and
the
order
contains
nothing
more
if
he
lets
himself
be
arrested
very
good
but
as
he
will
not
let
himself
be
arrested
as
he
will
resist
as
he
will
endeavor
to
kill
you
maurevel
grew
paler
you
will
defend
yourself
continued
catharine
one
can
not
ask
a
brave
man
like
you
to
let
himself
be
killed
without
defending
himself
and
in
defending
yourself
what
can
you
expect
you
must
let
come
what
may
you
understand
me
do
you
not
yes
madame
and
yet
come
do
you
want
me
to
write
or
after
the
words
to
i
confess
madame
that
that
would
do
away
with
my
scruples
well
it
must
be
done
of
course
since
you
do
not
think
the
order
can
be
carried
out
without
it
and
catharine
shrugged
her
shoulders
unrolled
the
parchment
with
one
hand
and
wrote
with
the
other
or
now
said
she
do
you
consider
the
order
all
right
yes
madame
replied
maurevel
but
i
beg
your
majesty
to
leave
the
carrying
out
of
the
entire
affair
to
me
what
have
i
said
that
will
interfere
with
it
your
majesty
told
me
to
take
a
dozen
men
yes
to
make
sure
well
i
ask
permission
to
take
only
six
why
so
because
madame
if
anything
happens
to
the
prince
as
it
probably
will
it
would
be
easy
to
excuse
six
men
for
having
been
afraid
of
losing
the
prisoner
but
no
one
would
excuse
a
dozen
guards
for
not
having
let
half
of
their
number
be
killed
before
laying
hands
on
royalty
fine
royalty
in
truth
which
has
no
kingdom
madame
said
maurevel
it
is
not
the
kingdom
which
makes
the
king
it
is
birth
very
well
said
catharine
do
as
you
please
only
i
must
warn
you
that
i
do
not
wish
you
to
leave
the
louvre
but
madame
to
get
my
men
together
have
you
not
a
sort
of
sergeant
whom
you
can
charge
with
this
duty
i
have
my
lackey
who
not
only
is
a
faithful
fellow
but
who
has
even
occasionally
aided
me
in
this
sort
of
thing
send
for
him
and
confer
with
him
you
know
the
chamber
hung
with
the
king
arms
do
you
not
well
your
breakfast
shall
be
served
there
and
from
there
you
shall
give
your
orders
the
place
will
aid
you
to
collect
your
wits
in
case
they
are
scattered
then
when
my
son
returns
from
the
hunt
you
are
to
go
into
my
oratory
and
wait
until
the
time
comes
but
how
are
we
to
get
into
the
room
probably
the
king
suspects
something
and
he
will
shut
himself
up
in
it
i
have
a
duplicate
key
to
every
door
said
catharine
and
the
bolts
have
been
removed
from
henry
room
adieu
monsieur
de
maurevel
for
a
while
i
will
have
you
taken
to
the
king
armory
ah
by
the
way
remember
that
the
order
of
a
king
must
be
carried
out
before
anything
else
no
excuse
is
admissible
a
defeat
even
a
failure
would
compromise
the
honor
of
the
king
it
is
a
serious
matter
and
catharine
without
giving
maurevel
time
to
answer
called
monsieur
de
nancey
the
captain
of
the
guards
and
ordered
him
to
conduct
maurevel
to
the
king
armory
my
god
exclaimed
maurevel
as
he
followed
his
guide
i
have
risen
to
the
hierarchy
of
assassination
from
a
simple
gentleman
to
a
captain
from
a
captain
to
an
admiral
from
an
admiral
to
a
king
without
a
crown
who
knows
if
i
shall
not
some
day
be
a
king
with
a
crown
chapter
xxxi
the
hunt
the
outrider
who
had
turned
aside
the
boar
and
who
had
told
the
king
that
the
animal
had
not
left
the
place
was
not
mistaken
scarcely
were
the
bloodhounds
put
on
the
trail
before
it
plunged
into
the
thickets
and
from
a
cluster
of
thorn
bushes
drove
out
the
boar
which
the
outrider
had
recognized
by
its
track
it
was
a
recluse
that
is
the
strangest
kind
of
animal
it
started
straight
ahead
and
crossed
the
road
fifty
feet
from
the
king
followed
only
by
the
bloodhound
which
had
driven
it
back
the
first
relay
of
dogs
was
at
once
let
loose
twenty
in
number
which
sprang
after
it
hunting
was
charles
chief
passion
scarcely
had
the
animal
crossed
the
road
before
he
started
after
it
followed
by
the
duc
and
henry
to
whom
a
sign
had
indicated
that
he
must
not
leave
charles
the
rest
of
the
hunters
followed
the
king
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
writing
the
royal
forests
were
far
from
being
what
they
are
great
parks
intersected
by
carriage
roads
then
traffic
was
almost
wanting
kings
had
not
yet
conceived
the
idea
of
being
merchants
and
of
dividing
their
woods
into
fellings
copses
and
forests
the
trees
planted
not
by
learned
foresters
but
by
the
hand
of
god
who
threw
the
grain
to
the
will
of
the
winds
were
not
arranged
in
quincunxes
but
grew
as
they
pleased
as
they
do
in
any
virginal
forest
of
america
in
short
a
forest
in
those
days
was
a
den
of
the
wild
boar
the
stag
the
wolf
and
robbers
and
a
dozen
paths
starting
from
one
point
starred
that
of
bondy
surrounded
by
a
circular
road
as
the
circle
of
a
wheel
surrounds
its
fellies
to
carry
the
comparison
further
the
nave
would
not
be
a
bad
representation
of
the
single
point
where
the
parties
meet
in
the
centre
of
the
wood
where
the
wandering
hunters
rally
to
start
out
again
towards
the
point
where
the
lost
animal
again
appears
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
there
happened
what
always
happens
in
such
cases
insurmountable
obstacles
rose
in
the
path
of
the
hunters
the
cries
of
the
dogs
were
lost
in
the
distance
and
the
king
returned
to
the
cursing
and
swearing
as
was
his
habit
well
well
henriot
said
he
there
you
are
by
heaven
as
calm
and
unruffled
as
nuns
following
their
abbess
that
is
not
hunting
why
you
look
as
though
you
had
just
stepped
out
of
a
and
you
are
so
saturated
with
perfumery
that
if
you
were
to
pass
between
the
boar
and
my
dogs
you
might
put
them
off
the
scent
and
you
henry
where
is
your
spear
your
musket
let
us
see
sire
said
henry
of
what
use
is
a
musket
i
know
that
your
majesty
likes
to
shoot
the
beast
when
the
dogs
have
caught
it
as
to
a
spear
i
am
clumsy
enough
with
this
weapon
which
is
not
much
used
among
our
mountains
where
we
hunt
the
bear
with
a
simple
dagger
by
heavens
henry
when
you
return
to
your
pyrenees
you
will
have
to
send
me
a
whole
cartload
of
bears
it
must
be
a
pretty
hunt
that
is
carried
on
at
such
close
quarters
with
an
animal
which
might
strangle
us
listen
i
think
i
hear
the
dogs
no
i
am
mistaken
the
king
took
his
horn
and
blew
a
blast
several
horns
answered
him
suddenly
an
outrider
appeared
who
blew
another
blast
the
boar
the
boar
cried
the
king
he
galloped
off
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
hunters
who
had
rallied
round
him
the
outrider
was
not
mistaken
as
the
king
advanced
they
began
to
hear
the
barking
of
the
pack
which
consisted
of
more
than
sixty
dogs
for
one
after
another
they
had
let
loose
all
the
relays
placed
at
the
points
the
boar
had
already
passed
the
king
saw
the
boar
again
and
taking
advantage
of
a
clump
of
high
trees
he
rushed
after
him
blowing
his
horn
with
all
his
might
for
some
time
the
princes
followed
him
but
the
king
had
such
a
strong
horse
and
was
so
carried
away
by
his
ardor
and
he
rode
over
such
rough
roads
and
through
such
thick
underbrush
that
at
first
the
ladies
then
the
duc
de
guise
and
his
gentlemen
and
finally
the
two
princes
were
forced
to
abandon
him
tavannes
held
out
for
a
time
longer
but
at
length
he
too
gave
up
except
charles
and
a
few
outriders
who
excited
over
a
promised
reward
would
not
leave
the
king
everyone
had
gathered
about
the
open
space
in
the
centre
of
the
wood
the
two
princes
were
together
on
a
narrow
path
the
duc
de
guise
and
his
gentlemen
had
halted
a
hundred
feet
from
them
further
on
were
the
ladies
does
it
not
really
seem
said
the
duc
to
henry
indicating
by
a
wink
the
duc
de
guise
that
that
man
with
his
escort
sheathed
in
steel
is
the
real
king
poor
princes
that
we
are
he
does
not
even
honor
us
by
a
glance
why
should
he
treat
us
better
than
we
treat
our
own
relatives
replied
henry
why
brother
are
not
you
and
i
prisoners
at
the
court
of
france
hostages
from
our
party
duc
françois
started
at
these
words
and
looked
at
henry
as
if
to
provoke
further
explanation
but
henry
had
said
more
than
he
usually
did
and
was
silent
what
do
you
mean
henry
asked
the
duc
françois
visibly
annoyed
that
his
by
stopping
had
left
him
to
open
the
conversation
i
say
brother
said
henry
that
all
these
men
who
are
so
well
armed
whose
duty
seems
to
be
not
to
lose
sight
of
us
look
exactly
like
guards
preventing
two
people
from
running
away
running
away
why
how
asked
admirably
successful
in
his
pretended
surprise
and
innocence
you
have
a
magnificent
mount
françois
said
henry
following
out
his
thoughts
while
apparently
changing
the
conversation
i
am
sure
he
could
make
seven
leagues
in
an
hour
and
twenty
between
now
and
noon
it
is
a
fine
day
and
one
feels
like
saying
see
the
beautiful
does
it
not
tempt
you
françois
as
to
me
my
spurs
burn
me
françois
did
not
reply
but
he
first
turned
red
and
then
white
then
he
bent
his
head
as
if
listening
for
sounds
from
the
hunters
the
news
from
poland
is
having
its
effect
said
henry
and
my
dear
has
his
plans
he
would
like
me
to
escape
but
i
shall
not
do
so
by
myself
scarcely
had
this
thought
passed
through
his
mind
before
several
new
converts
who
had
come
to
court
during
the
past
two
or
three
months
galloped
up
and
smiled
pleasantly
on
the
two
princes
the
duc
provoked
by
henry
remarks
had
but
one
word
to
say
one
gesture
to
make
and
it
was
evident
that
thirty
or
forty
horsemen
who
at
that
moment
gathered
around
them
as
though
to
oppose
the
troop
belonging
to
monsieur
de
guise
favored
his
flight
but
he
turned
aside
his
head
and
raising
his
horn
to
his
lips
he
sounded
the
rally
but
the
newcomers
as
if
they
thought
that
the
hesitation
on
the
part
of
the
duc
was
due
to
the
presence
of
the
followers
of
the
de
guises
had
by
degrees
glided
among
them
and
the
two
princes
and
had
drawn
themselves
up
in
echelons
with
a
strategic
skill
which
showed
the
usual
military
disposition
in
fact
to
reach
the
duc
and
the
king
of
navarre
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
pass
through
this
company
while
as
far
as
eye
could
reach
a
perfectly
free
road
stretched
out
before
the
brothers
suddenly
from
among
the
trees
ten
feet
from
the
king
of
navarre
another
gentleman
appeared
as
yet
unperceived
by
the
two
princes
henry
was
trying
to
think
who
he
was
when
the
gentleman
raised
his
hat
and
henry
recognized
him
as
the
vicomte
de
turenne
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
protestant
party
who
was
supposed
to
be
in
poitou
the
vicomte
even
ventured
to
make
a
sign
which
clearly
meant
will
you
come
but
having
consulted
the
impassable
face
and
dull
eye
of
the
duc
henry
turned
his
head
two
or
three
times
over
his
shoulder
as
if
something
was
the
matter
with
his
neck
or
doublet
this
was
a
refusal
the
vicomte
understood
it
put
both
spurs
to
his
horse
and
disappeared
in
the
thicket
at
that
moment
the
pack
was
heard
approaching
then
they
saw
the
boar
followed
by
the
dogs
cross
the
end
of
the
path
where
they
were
all
gathered
then
charles
like
an
infernal
hunter
hatless
the
horn
at
his
mouth
blowing
enough
to
burst
his
lungs
three
or
four
outriders
followed
tavannes
had
disappeared
the
king
cried
the
duc
and
he
rode
after
him
reassured
by
the
presence
of
his
good
friends
henry
signed
to
them
not
to
leave
and
advanced
towards
the
ladies
well
said
marguerite
taking
a
few
steps
towards
him
well
madame
said
henry
we
are
hunting
the
wild
boar
is
that
all
yes
the
wind
has
changed
since
morning
but
i
believe
you
predicted
this
these
changes
of
the
wind
are
bad
for
hunting
are
they
not
monsieur
asked
marguerite
yes
said
henry
they
sometimes
upset
all
plans
which
have
to
be
made
over
again
just
then
the
barking
of
the
dogs
began
to
be
heard
as
they
rapidly
approached
and
a
sort
of
noisy
dust
warned
the
hunters
to
be
on
their
guard
each
one
raised
his
head
and
listened
almost
immediately
the
boar
appeared
again
but
instead
of
returning
to
the
woods
he
followed
the
road
that
led
directly
to
the
open
space
where
were
the
ladies
the
gentlemen
paying
court
to
them
and
the
hunters
who
had
given
up
the
chase
behind
the
animal
came
thirty
or
forty
great
dogs
panting
then
twenty
feet
behind
them
king
charles
without
hat
or
cloak
his
clothes
torn
by
the
thorns
his
face
and
hands
covered
with
blood
one
or
two
outriders
were
with
him
the
king
stopped
blowing
his
horn
only
to
urge
on
his
dogs
and
stopped
urging
on
his
dogs
only
to
return
to
his
horn
he
saw
no
one
had
his
horse
stumbled
he
might
have
cried
out
as
did
richard
iii
my
kingdom
for
a
horse
but
the
horse
seemed
as
eager
as
his
master
his
feet
did
not
touch
the
ground
and
his
nostrils
breathed
forth
fire
boar
dogs
and
king
passed
like
a
dream
halloo
halloo
cried
the
king
as
he
went
by
raising
the
horn
to
his
bloody
lips
a
few
feet
behind
him
came
the
duc
and
two
outriders
but
the
horses
of
the
others
had
given
out
or
else
they
were
lost
everyone
started
after
the
king
for
it
was
evident
that
the
boar
would
soon
be
taken
in
fact
at
the
end
of
about
ten
minutes
the
animal
left
the
path
it
had
been
following
and
sprang
into
the
bushes
but
reaching
an
open
space
it
ran
to
a
rock
and
faced
the
dogs
at
the
shouts
from
charles
who
had
followed
it
everyone
drew
near
they
arrived
at
an
interesting
point
in
the
chase
the
boar
seemed
determined
to
make
a
desperate
defence
the
dogs
excited
by
a
run
of
more
than
three
hours
rushed
on
it
with
a
fury
which
increased
the
shouts
and
the
oaths
of
the
king
all
the
hunters
formed
a
circle
the
king
somewhat
in
advance
behind
him
the
duc
armed
with
a
musket
and
henry
who
had
nothing
but
his
simple
hunting
knife
the
duc
unfastened
his
musket
and
lighted
the
match
henry
moved
his
knife
in
its
sheath
as
to
the
duc
de
guise
disdainful
of
all
the
details
of
hunting
he
stood
somewhat
apart
from
the
others
with
his
gentlemen
the
women
gathered
together
in
a
group
formed
a
counterpart
to
that
of
the
duke
everyone
who
was
anything
of
a
hunter
stood
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
animal
in
anxious
expectation
to
one
side
an
outrider
was
endeavoring
to
restrain
the
king
two
mastiffs
which
encased
in
their
coats
of
mail
were
waiting
to
take
the
boar
by
the
ears
howling
and
jumping
about
in
such
a
manner
that
every
instant
one
might
think
they
would
burst
their
chains
the
boar
made
a
wonderful
resistance
attacked
at
once
by
forty
or
more
dogs
which
enveloped
it
like
a
roaring
tide
which
covered
it
by
their
motley
carpet
which
on
all
sides
was
striving
to
reach
its
skin
wrinkled
with
bristles
at
each
blow
of
its
snout
it
hurled
a
dog
ten
feet
in
the
air
the
dogs
fell
back
torn
to
pieces
and
with
entrails
dragging
at
once
returned
to
the
fray
charles
with
hair
on
end
bloodshot
eyes
and
inflated
nostrils
leaned
over
the
neck
of
his
dripping
horse
shouting
furious
halloos
in
less
than
ten
minutes
twenty
dogs
were
out
of
the
fight
the
mastiffs
cried
charles
the
mastiffs
at
this
shout
the
outrider
opened
the
of
the
leashes
and
the
two
bloodhounds
rushed
into
the
midst
of
the
carnage
overturning
everything
scattering
everything
making
a
way
with
their
coats
of
mail
to
the
animal
which
they
seized
by
the
ear
the
boar
knowing
that
it
was
caught
clinched
its
teeth
both
from
rage
and
pain
bravo
duredent
bravo
risquetout
cried
charles
courage

a

a
spear

said
the

the
king
no
one
can
not
feel
a
bullet
when
he
shoots
there
is
no
fun
in
it
but
one
can
feel
a
spear
a
spear
a
spear
they
handed
the
king
a
hunting
spear
hardened
by
fire
and
armed
with
a
steel

take

marguerite

said
charles
couching

at

held
by
the
two
bloodhounds
could
not
escape
the
blow
but
at
sight
of
the
shining
lance
it
turned
to
one
side
and
the
weapon
instead
of
sinking
into
its
breast
glided
over
its
shoulder
and
blunted
itself
against
the
rock
to
which
the
animal
had
run
a
thousand
devils
cried
the
king
i
have
missed
him
a
spear
a
spear
and
bending
back
as
horsemen
do
when
they
are
going
to
take
a
fence
he
hurled
his
useless
lance
from
him
an
outrider
advanced
and
offered
him
another
but
at
that
moment
as
though
it
foresaw
the
fate
which
awaited
it
and
which
it
wished
to
resist
by
a
violent
effort
the
boar
snatched
its
torn
ears
from
the
teeth
of
the
bloodhounds
and
with
eyes
bloody
protruding
hideous
its
breath
burning
like
the
heat
from
a
furnace
with
chattering
teeth
and
lowered
head
it
sprang
at
the
king
horse
charles
was
too
good
a
hunter
not
to
have
foreseen
this
he
turned
his
horse
which
began
to
rear
but
he
had
miscalculated
the
pressure
and
the
horse
too
tightly
reined
in
or
perhaps
giving
way
to
his
fright
fell
over
backwards
the
spectators
gave
a
terrible
cry
the
horse
had
fallen
and
the
king
leg
was
under
him
your
hand
sire
give
me
your
hand
said
henry
the
king
let
go
his
horse
bridle
seized
the
saddle
with
his
left
hand
and
tried
to
draw
out
his
hunting
knife
with
his
right
but
the
knife
pressed
into
his
belt
by
the
weight
of
his
body
would
not
come
from
its
sheath
the
boar
the
boar
cried
charles
it
is
on
me
on
me
the
horse
recovering
himself
as
if
he
understood
his
master
danger
stretched
his
muscles
and
had
already
succeeded
in
getting
up
on
its
three
legs
when
at
the
cry
from
his
brother
henry
saw
the
duc
françois
grow
frightfully
pale
and
raise
the
musket
to
his
shoulder
but
instead
of
striking
the
boar
which
was
but
two
feet
from
the
king
the
ball
broke
the
knee
of
the
horse
which
fell
down
again
his
nose
touching
the
ground
at
that
instant
the
boar
with
its
snout
tore
charles
boot
oh
murmured
with
ashy
lips
i
suppose
that
the
duc
is
king
of
france
and
that
i
am
king
of
poland
the
boar
was
about
to
attack
charles
leg
when
suddenly
the
latter
felt
someone
raise
his
arm
then
he
saw
the
flash
of
a
blade
which
was
driven
into
the
shoulder
of
the
boar
and
disappeared
up
to
its
guard
while
a
hand
gloved
in
steel
turned
aside
the
head
already
poked
under
his
clothes
as
the
horse
had
risen
charles
had
succeeded
in
freeing
his
leg
and
now
raising
himself
heavily
he
saw
that
he
was
dripping
with
blood
whereupon
he
became
as
pale
as
a
corpse
sire
said
henry
who
still
knelt
holding
the
boar
pierced
to
the
heart
sire
it
is
nothing
i
turned
aside
the
teeth
and
your
majesty
is
not
hurt
then
he
rose
let
go
the
knife
and
the
boar
fell
back
pouring
forth
more
blood
from
its
mouth
than
from
its
wound
charles
surrounded
by
a
breathless
crowd
assailed
by
cries
of
terror
which
would
have
dashed
the
greatest
courage
was
for
a
moment
ready
to
fall
on
the
dying
animal
but
he
recovered
himself
and
turning
toward
the
king
of
navarre
he
pressed
his
hand
with
a
look
in
which
shone
the
first
spark
of
feeling
that
had
been
roused
in
his
heart
for
years
thank
you
henriot
said
he
my
poor
brother
cried
approaching
charles
ah
it
is
you
is
it
said
the
king
well
famous
marksman
that
you
are
what
became
of
your
ball
it
must
have
flattened
itself
against
the
boar
said
the
duke
well
my
god
exclaimed
henry
with
admirably
assumed
surprise
you
see
françois
your
bullet
has
broken
the
leg
of
his
majesty
horse
that
is
strange
what
said
the
king
is
that
true
it
is
possible
said
the
duke
terrified
my
hand
shook
so
the
fact
is
that
for
a
clever
marksman
that
was
a
strange
thing
to
do
françois
said
charles
frowning
a
second
time
henriot
i
thank
you
gentlemen
continued
the
king
let
us
return
to
paris
i
have
had
enough
of
this
marguerite
came
up
to
congratulate
henry
yes
indeed
margot
said
charles
congratulate
him
and
sincerely
too
for
without
him
the
king
of
france
would
be
henry
iii
alas
madame
said
the
béarnais
monsieur
le
duc
who
is
already
my
enemy
will
be
angrier
than
ever
at
me
but
what
can
you
expect
one
does
what
one
can
ask
monsieur
and
bowing
he
drew
his
knife
from
the
wild
boar
body
and
dug
it
two
or
three
times
into
the
earth
to
wipe
off
the
blood
part
ii
chapter
xxxii
fraternity
in
saving
the
life
of
charles
henry
had
done
more
than
save
the
life
of
a
man
he
had
prevented
three
kingdoms
from
changing
sovereigns
had
charles
ix
been
killed
the
duc
would
have
become
king
of
france
and
the
duc
in
all
probability
would
have
been
king
of
poland
as
to
navarre
as
monsieur
le
duc
was
the
lover
of
madame
de
condé
its
crown
would
probably
have
paid
to
the
husband
the
complacency
of
his
wife
now
in
all
this
no
good
would
have
come
to
henry
he
would
have
changed
masters
that
would
have
been
all
instead
of
charles
ix
who
tolerated
him
he
would
have
seen
the
duc
on
the
throne
of
france
and
being
of
one
heart
and
mind
with
his
mother
catharine
the
latter
had
sworn
that
he
should
die
and
he
would
not
have
failed
to
keep
his
oath
all
these
thoughts
entered
his
mind
when
the
wild
boar
sprang
at
charles
and
we
know
that
the
result
of
his
rapid
thinking
was
that
his
own
life
was
attached
to
that
of
charles
ix
charles
ix
had
been
saved
by
an
act
of
devotion
the
motive
of
which
the
king
could
not
fathom
but
marguerite
had
understood
and
she
had
admired
that
strange
courage
of
henry
which
like
flashes
of
lightning
shone
only
in
a
storm
unfortunately
it
was
not
all
to
have
escaped
the
kingdom
of
the
duc
henry
had
to
make
himself
king
he
had
to
dispute
navarre
with
the
duc
and
with
the
prince
of
condé
above
all
he
had
to
leave
the
court
where
one
walked
only
between
two
precipices
and
go
away
protected
by
a
son
of
france
as
he
returned
from
bondy
henry
pondered
deeply
on
the
situation
on
arriving
at
the
louvre
his
plan
was
formed
without
removing
his
just
as
he
was
covered
with
dust
and
blood
he
betook
himself
to
the
apartments
of
the
duc
whom
he
found
striding
up
and
down
in
great
agitation
on
perceiving
him
the
prince
gave
a
start
of
surprise
yes
said
henry
taking
him
by
both
hands
yes
i
understand
my
good
brother
you
are
angry
because
i
was
the
first
to
call
the
attention
to
the
fact
that
your
ball
struck
the
leg
of
his
horse
instead
of
the
boar
as
you
intended
it
should
but
what
can
you
expect
i
could
not
prevent
an
exclamation
of
surprise
besides
the
king
would
have
noticed
it
would
he
not
no
doubt
no
doubt
murmured
and
yet
i
can
think
of
it
only
as
an
evil
intention
on
your
part
to
denounce
me
as
you
did
and
which
as
you
yourself
saw
had
no
result
except
to
make
my
brother
charles
suspect
me
and
to
make
hard
feeling
between
us
we
will
return
to
this
in
a
few
moments
as
to
my
good
or
evil
intentions
regarding
you
i
have
come
to
you
on
purpose
that
you
may
judge
them
very
good
said
with
his
customary
reserve
speak
henry
i
am
listening
when
i
have
spoken
françois
you
will
readily
see
what
my
intentions
are
for
the
confidence
i
am
going
to
place
in
you
does
away
with
all
reserve
and
prudence
and
when
i
have
told
you
you
will
be
able
to
ruin
me
by
a
single
word
what
is
it
said
françois
beginning
to
be
anxious
and
yet
continued
henry
i
have
hesitated
a
long
time
to
speak
to
you
of
the
thing
which
brings
me
here
especially
after
the
way
in
which
you
turned
a
deaf
ear
really
said
françois
growing
pale
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
henry
brother
your
interests
are
too
dear
to
me
not
to
tell
you
that
the
huguenots
have
made
advances
to
me
advances
said
what
advances
one
of
them
monsieur
de
mouy
of
saint
phal
the
son
of
the
brave
de
mouy
assassinated
by
maurevel
you
know
yes
well
he
came
at
the
risk
of
his
life
to
show
me
that
i
was
in
captivity
ah
indeed
and
what
did
you
say
to
him
brother
you
know
that
i
love
charles
dearly
he
has
saved
my
life
and
the
queen
mother
has
been
like
a
real
mother
to
me
so
i
refused
all
the
offers
he
made
me
what
were
these
offers
the
huguenots
want
to
reconstruct
the
throne
of
navarre
and
as
in
reality
this
throne
belongs
to
me
by
inheritance
they
offered
it
to
me
yes
and
monsieur
de
mouy
instead
of
the
consent
he
expected
to
ask
for
has
received
your
relinquishment
my
formal
relinquishment
even
in
writing
but
since
continued
henry
you
have
repented
brother
interrupted
no
i
merely
thought
i
noticed
that
monsieur
de
mouy
had
become
discontented
with
me
and
was
paying
his
visits
elsewhere
where
asked
françois
quickly
i
do
not
know
at
the
prince
of
condé
perhaps
yes
that
might
be
said
the
duke
besides
went
on
henry
i
have
positive
knowledge
as
to
the
leader
he
has
chosen
françois
grew
pale
but
continued
henry
the
huguenots
are
divided
among
themselves
and
de
mouy
brave
and
loyal
as
he
is
represents
only
of
the
party
now
this
other
half
which
is
not
to
be
scorned
has
not
given
up
the
hope
of
having
henry
of
navarre
on
the
throne
who
having
hesitated
at
first
may
have
reflected
since
you
think
this
oh
every
day
i
receive
proofs
of
it
the
troops
which
joined
us
at
the
hunt
did
you
notice
of
what
men
it
was
composed
yes
of
converted
gentlemen
did
you
recognize
the
leader
of
the
troop
who
signed
to
me
yes
it
was
the
vicomte
de
turenne
did
you
know
what
they
wanted
of
me
yes
they
proposed
to
you
to
escape
then
said
henry
to
françois
who
was
growing
restless
there
is
evidently
a
second
party
which
wants
something
else
besides
what
monsieur
de
mouy
wants
a
second
party
yes
and
a
very
powerful
one
i
tell
you
so
that
in
order
to
succeed
it
is
necessary
to
unite
the
two
turenne
and
de
mouy
the
conspiracy
progresses
the
troops
are
ready
the
signal
alone
is
waited
for
now
in
this
supreme
situation
which
demands
prompt
solution
on
my
part
i
have
come
to
two
decisions
between
which
i
am
wavering
i
have
come
to
submit
these
decisions
to
you
as
to
a
friend
say
rather
as
to
a
brother
yes
as
to
a
brother
went
on
henry
speak
then
i
am
listening
in
the
first
place
i
ought
to
explain
to
you
the
condition
of
my
mind
my
dear
françois
no
desire
no
ambition
no
ability
i
am
an
honest
country
gentleman
poor
sensual
and
timid
the
career
of
conspirator
offers
me
indignities
poorly
compensated
for
even
by
the
certain
prospect
of
a
crown
ah
brother
said
françois
you
do
wrong
sad
indeed
is
the
position
of
a
prince
whose
fortune
is
limited
by
the
boundary
of
the
paternal
estate
or
by
a
man
in
a
career
for
honors
i
do
not
believe
therefore
in
what
you
tell
me
and
yet
what
i
tell
you
is
so
true
brother
that
if
i
thought
i
had
a
true
friend
i
would
resign
in
his
favor
the
power
which
this
party
wishes
to
give
me
but
he
added
with
a
sigh
i
have
none
perhaps
you
have
you
probably
are
mistaken
no
saint
said
henry
except
yourself
brother
i
see
no
one
who
is
attached
to
me
so
that
rather
than
let
fail
an
attempt
which
might
bring
to
light
some
unworthy
man
i
truly
prefer
to
inform
my
brother
the
king
of
what
is
taking
place
i
will
mention
no
names
i
will
designate
neither
country
nor
date
but
i
will
foretell
the
catastrophe
great
god
exclaimed
unable
to
repress
his
terror
what
do
you
mean
what
you
you
the
sole
hope
of
the
party
since
the
death
of
the
admiral
you
a
converted
huguenot
a
poor
convert
or
at
least
such
you
were
thought
to
be
you
would
raise
the
knife
against
your
brothers
henry
henry
by
doing
this
do
you
know
that
you
would
be
delivering
to
a
second
saint
bartholomew
all
the
calvinists
in
the
kingdom
do
you
know
that
catharine
is
waiting
for
just
such
a
chance
to
exterminate
all
who
have
survived
and
the
duke
trembling
his
face
spotted
with
red
and
white
blotches
pressed
henry
hand
to
beg
him
to
give
up
this
idea
which
would
ruin
him
what
said
henry
with
an
expression
of
perfect
do
you
think
there
would
be
so
much
trouble
françois
with
the
king
word
however
it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
avoid
it
the
word
of
king
charles
henry
did
not
the
admiral
have
it
did
not
téligny
have
it
did
not
you
yourself
have
it
oh
henry
i
tell
you
if
you
do
this
you
will
ruin
us
all
not
only
them
but
all
who
have
had
direct
or
indirect
relations
with
them
henry
seemed
to
ponder
an
instant
if
i
were
an
important
prince
at
court
said
he
i
should
act
differently
in
your
place
for
instance
in
your
place
françois
a
son
of
france
and
probable
heir
to
the
crown
françois
shook
his
head
ironically
in
my
place
said
he
what
would
you
do
in
your
place
brother
replied
henry
i
should
place
myself
at
the
head
of
the
movement
and
direct
it
my
name
and
my
credit
should
answer
to
my
conscience
for
the
life
of
the
rebellious
and
i
should
derive
some
benefit
first
for
myself
then
for
the
king
perhaps
from
an
enterprise
which
otherwise
might
do
the
greatest
injury
to
france
listened
to
these
words
with
a
joy
which
caused
every
muscle
of
his
face
to
expand
do
you
think
said
he
that
this
method
is
practicable
and
that
it
would
save
us
all
the
disasters
you
foresee
i
think
so
said
henry
the
huguenots
love
you
your
bearing
is
modest
your
position
both
high
and
interesting
and
the
kindness
you
have
always
shown
to
those
of
the
faith
will
incline
them
to
serve
you
but
said
there
is
a
division
in
the
party
will
those
who
want
you
want
me
i
will
undertake
to
bring
them
together
by
two
means
what
means
first
by
the
confidence
the
leaders
have
in
me
then
by
the
fear
that
your
highness
knowing
their
names
but
who
will
tell
me
these
names
i
saint
you
will
do
that
listen
françois
as
i
told
you
you
are
the
only
one
i
love
at
court
said
henry
this
no
doubt
is
because
you
are
persecuted
like
myself
and
then
my
wife
too
loves
you
with
an
affection
which
is
unequalled
françois
flushed
with
pleasure
believe
me
brother
continued
henry
take
this
thing
in
hand
reign
in
navarre
and
provided
you
keep
a
place
at
your
table
for
me
and
a
fine
forest
in
which
to
hunt
i
shall
consider
myself
fortunate
reign
in
navarre
said
the
duke
but
if
if
the
duc
is
chosen
king
of
poland
is
that
it
i
will
finish
your
thought
for
you
françois
looked
at
henry
with
something
like
terror
well
listen
françois
continued
henry
since
nothing
escapes
you
this
is
how
i
reason
if
the
duc
is
chosen
king
of
poland
and
our
brother
charles
god
keep
him
should
happen
to
die
it
is
but
two
hundred
leagues
from
pau
to
paris
while
it
is
four
hundred
from
paris
to
cracovie
so
you
would
be
here
to
receive
the
inheritance
by
the
time
the
king
of
poland
learned
it
was
vacant
then
if
you
are
satisfied
with
me
you
could
give
me
the
kingdom
of
navarre
which
would
thenceforth
be
merely
one
of
the
jewels
in
your
crown
in
that
way
i
would
accept
it
the
worst
that
could
happen
to
you
would
be
that
you
would
remain
king
there
and
bring
up
a
race
of
kings
by
living
with
me
and
my
family
while
here
what
are
you
a
poor
persecuted
prince
a
poor
third
son
of
a
king
the
slave
of
two
elder
brothers
and
one
whom
a
whim
may
send
to
the
bastille
yes
yes
said
françois
i
know
that
very
well
so
well
that
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
give
up
this
plan
you
propose
to
me
is
there
no
throb
there
and
the
duc
put
his
hand
on
his
brother
heart
there
are
said
henry
smiling
burdens
too
heavy
for
some
hands
therefore
i
shall
not
try
to
raise
this
one
fear
of
fatigue
is
greater
than
the
desire
of
possession
so
henry
you
really
renounce
it
i
said
so
to
de
mouy
and
i
repeat
it
to
you
but
in
such
cases
my
dear
brother
said
one
does
not
say
one
proves
henry
breathed
like
a
pugilist
who
feels
his
enemy
back
bending
i
will
prove
it
this
evening
said
he
at
nine
we
shall
have
the
names
of
the
leaders
and
the
plan
of
the
undertaking
i
have
already
sent
my
renunciation
to
de
mouy
françois
took
henry
hand
and
pressed
it
effusively
between
his
own
at
that
moment
catharine
entered
the
duc
rooms
unannounced
as
was
her
habit
together
said
she
smiling
two
good
brothers
truly
i
trust
so
madame
said
henry
with
great
coolness
while
the
duc
turned
white
from
distress
henry
stepped
back
to
leave
catharine
free
to
speak
with
her
son
the
queen
mother
drew
a
magnificent
jewel
from
her
bag
this
clasp
comes
from
florence
said
she
i
will
give
it
to
you
for
the
belt
of
your
sword
then
in
a
low
tone
if
you
hear
any
noise
in
your
good
brother
henry
room
do
not
stir
françois
pressed
his
mother
hand
and
said
will
you
allow
me
to
show
henry
the
beautiful
gift
you
have
just
given
me
you
may
do
more
give
it
to
him
in
your
name
and
in
mine
for
i
have
ordered
a
second
one
just
like
it
you
hear
henry
said
françois
my
good
mother
brings
me
this
jewel
and
doubles
its
value
by
allowing
me
to
give
it
to
you
henry
went
into
ecstasies
over
the
beauty
of
the
clasp
and
was
enthusiastic
in
his
thanks
when
his
delight
had
grown
calmer
my
son
said
catharine
i
feel
somewhat
indisposed
and
i
am
going
to
bed
your
brother
charles
is
greatly
wearied
from
his
fall
and
is
going
to
do
the
same
so
we
shall
not
have
supper
together
this
evening
but
each
will
be
served
in
his
own
room
oh
henry
i
forgot
to
congratulate
you
on
your
bravery
and
quickness
you
saved
your
king
and
your
brother
and
you
shall
be
rewarded
for
it
i
am
already
rewarded
madame
replied
henry
bowing
by
the
feeling
that
you
have
done
your
duty
replied
catharine
that
is
not
enough
and
charles
and
i
will
do
something
to
pay
the
debt
we
owe
you
everything
that
comes
to
me
from
you
and
my
good
brother
will
be
welcome
madame
then
he
bowed
and
withdrew
ah
brother
françois
thought
henry
as
he
left
i
am
sure
now
of
not
leaving
alone
and
the
conspiracy
which
had
a
body
has
found
a
head
and
a
heart
only
let
us
look
out
for
ourselves
catharine
gives
me
a
present
catharine
promises
me
a
reward
there
is
some
deviltry
beneath
it
all
i
must
confer
this
evening
with
marguerite
chapter
xxxiii
the
gratitude
of
king
charles
ix
maurevel
had
spent
a
part
of
the
day
in
the
king
armory
but
when
it
was
time
for
the
hunters
to
return
from
the
chase
catharine
sent
him
into
her
oratory
with
the
guards
who
had
joined
him
charles
informed
by
his
nurse
on
his
arrival
that
a
man
had
spent
part
of
the
day
in
his
room
was
at
first
very
angry
that
a
stranger
had
been
admitted
into
his
apartments
but
his
nurse
described
the
man
saying
that
he
was
the
same
one
she
herself
had
been
ordered
to
admit
one
evening
and
the
king
realized
that
it
was
maurevel
then
remembering
the
order
his
mother
had
wrung
from
him
that
morning
he
understood
everything
oh
ho
murmured
charles
the
same
day
on
which
he
has
saved
my
life
the
time
is
badly
chosen
he
started
to
go
to
his
mother
but
one
thought
deterred
him
by
heaven
if
i
mention
this
to
her
it
will
result
in
a
discussion
better
for
us
to
act
by
ourselves
nurse
said
he
lock
every
door
and
say
to
queen
elizabeth
that
i
am
suffering
somewhat
from
the
fall
i
have
had
and
that
i
shall
sleep
alone
the
nurse
obeyed
and
as
it
was
not
yet
time
for
the
execution
of
his
plan
charles
sat
himself
down
to
compose
poetry
it
was
this
occupation
which
made
the
time
pass
most
quickly
for
the
king
nine
struck
before
he
thought
it
was
more
than
seven
he
counted
the
strokes
of
the
clock
one
by
one
and
at
the
last
he
rose
the
devil
said
he
it
is
just
time
taking
his
hat
and
cloak
he
left
his
room
by
a
secret
door
he
had
had
made
in
the
wall
the
existence
of
which
even
catharine
herself
was
ignorant
charles
went
directly
to
henry
apartments
on
leaving
the
duc
the
latter
had
gone
to
his
room
to
change
his
clothes
and
had
left
again
at
once
he
probably
has
decided
to
take
supper
with
margot
said
the
king
he
was
very
pleasant
with
her
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
me
he
went
to
the
queen
apartments
marguerite
had
brought
back
with
her
the
duchesse
de
nevers
coconnas
and
la
mole
and
was
having
a
supper
of
preserves
and
pastry
with
them
charles
knocked
at
the
hall
door
which
was
opened
by
gillonne
but
at
sight
of
the
king
she
was
so
frightened
that
she
scarcely
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
courtesy
and
instead
of
running
to
inform
her
mistress
of
the
august
visit
she
was
to
have
she
let
charles
enter
without
other
warning
than
the
cry
that
had
escaped
her
the
king
crossed
the
antechamber
and
guided
by
the
bursts
of
laughter
advanced
towards
the
poor
henriot
said
he
he
is
enjoying
himself
without
a
thought
of
evil
it
is
i
said
he
raising
the
portière
and
showing
a
smiling
face
marguerite
gave
a
terrible
cry
smiling
as
he
was
his
face
appeared
to
her
like
the
face
of
medusa
seated
opposite
the
door
she
had
recognized
him
at
once
the
two
men
turned
their
backs
to
the
king
your
majesty
cried
the
queen
rising
in
terror
the
three
other
guests
felt
their
heads
begin
to
swim
coconnas
alone
retained
his
he
rose
also
but
with
such
tactful
clumsiness
that
in
doing
so
he
upset
the
table
and
with
it
the
glass
plate
and
candles
instantly
there
was
complete
darkness
and
the
silence
of
death
run
said
coconnas
to
la
mole
quick
quick
la
mole
did
not
wait
to
be
told
twice
springing
to
the
side
of
the
wall
he
began
groping
with
his
hands
for
the
that
he
might
hide
in
the
cabinet
that
opened
out
of
it
and
which
he
knew
so
well
but
as
he
stepped
across
the
threshold
he
ran
against
a
man
who
had
just
entered
by
the
secret
corridor
what
does
all
this
mean
asked
charles
in
the
darkness
in
a
tone
which
was
beginning
to
betray
a
formidable
accent
of
impatience
am
i
such
a
that
the
sight
of
me
causes
all
this
confusion
come
henriot
henriot
where
are
you
answer
me
we
are
saved
murmured
marguerite
seizing
a
hand
which
she
took
for
that
of
la
mole
the
king
thinks
my
husband
is
one
of
our
guests
and
i
shall
let
him
think
so
madame
you
may
be
sure
said
henry
answering
the
queen
in
the
same
tone
great
god
cried
marguerite
hastily
dropping
the
hand
she
held
which
was
that
of
the
king
of
navarre
silence
said
henry
in
the
name
of
a
thousand
devils
why
are
you
whispering
in
this
way
cried
charles
henry
answer
me
where
are
you
here
sire
said
the
king
of
navarre
the
devil
said
coconnas
who
was
holding
the
duchesse
de
nevers
in
a
corner
the
plot
thickens
in
that
case
we
are
doubly
lost
said
henriette
coconnas
brave
to
the
point
of
rashness
had
reflected
that
the
candles
would
have
to
be
lighted
sooner
or
later
and
thinking
the
sooner
the
better
he
dropped
the
hand
of
madame
de
nevers
picked
up
a
taper
from
the
midst
of
the
débris
and
going
to
a
brazier
blew
on
a
piece
of
coal
with
which
he
at
once
made
a
light
the
chamber
was
again
illuminated
charles
ix
glanced
around
inquiringly
henry
was
by
the
side
of
his
wife
the
duchesse
de
nevers
was
alone
in
a
corner
while
coconnas
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
in
hand
lighting
up
the
whole
scene
excuse
me
brother
said
marguerite
we
were
not
expecting
you
so
as
you
may
have
perceived
your
majesty
filled
us
with
strange
terror
said
henriette
for
my
part
said
henry
who
had
surmised
everything
i
think
the
fear
was
so
real
that
in
rising
i
overturned
the
table
coconnas
glanced
at
the
king
of
navarre
as
much
as
to
say
good
here
is
a
man
who
understands
at
once
what
a
frightful
hubbub
repeated
charles
ix
your
supper
is
ruined
henriot
come
with
me
and
you
shall
finish
it
elsewhere
i
will
carry
you
off
this
evening
what
sire
said
henry
your
majesty
will
do
me
the
honor
yes
my
majesty
will
do
you
the
honor
of
taking
you
away
from
the
louvre
lend
him
to
me
margot
i
will
bring
him
back
to
you
morning
ah
brother
said
marguerite
you
do
not
need
my
permission
for
that
you
are
master
sire
said
henry
i
will
get
another
cloak
from
my
room
and
will
return
immediately
you
do
not
need
it
henriot
the
cloak
you
have
is
all
right
but
sire
began
the
béarnais
in
the
name
of
a
thousand
devils
i
tell
you
not
to
go
to
your
rooms
do
you
not
hear
what
i
say
come
along
yes
yes
go
said
marguerite
suddenly
pressing
her
husband
arm
for
a
singular
look
from
charles
had
convinced
her
that
something
unusual
was
going
on
here
i
am
sire
said
henry
charles
looked
at
coconnas
who
was
still
carrying
out
his
office
of
by
lighting
the
other
candles
who
is
this
gentleman
asked
the
king
of
henry
eyeing
the
piedmontese
from
head
to
foot
is
he
monsieur
de
la
mole
who
has
told
him
of
la
mole
asked
marguerite
in
a
low
tone
no
sire
replied
henry
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
not
here
i
regret
to
say
otherwise
i
should
have
the
honor
of
presenting
him
to
your
majesty
at
the
same
time
as
monsieur
de
coconnas
his
friend
they
are
perfectly
inseparable
and
both
are
in
the
suite
of
monsieur
ah
ah
our
famous
marksman
said
charles
good
then
frowning
is
not
this
monsieur
de
la
mole
a
huguenot
he
asked
he
is
converted
sire
and
i
will
answer
for
him
as
for
myself
when
you
answer
for
any
one
henriot
after
what
you
did
i
have
no
further
right
to
doubt
him
but
i
should
have
liked
to
see
this
monsieur
de
la
mole
however
i
can
meet
him
another
time
giving
a
last
glance
about
the
room
charles
embraced
marguerite
took
hold
of
the
arm
of
the
king
of
navarre
and
led
him
off
at
the
gate
of
the
louvre
henry
wanted
to
speak
to
some
one
come
come
pass
out
quickly
henriot
said
charles
when
i
tell
you
that
the
air
of
the
louvre
is
not
good
for
you
this
evening
the
devil
you
must
believe
me
saint
gris
murmured
henry
and
what
will
de
mouy
do
all
alone
in
my
room
i
trust
the
air
which
is
not
good
for
me
may
be
no
worse
for
him
ah
exclaimed
the
king
when
henry
and
he
had
crossed
the
drawbridge
does
it
suit
you
henry
to
have
the
gentlemen
of
monsieur
courting
your
wife
how
so
sire
truly
is
not
this
monsieur
de
coconnas
making
eyes
at
margot
who
told
you
that
well
said
the
king
i
heard
it
a
mere
joke
sire
monsieur
de
coconnas
does
make
eyes
at
some
one
but
it
is
at
madame
de
nevers
ah
bah
i
can
answer
to
your
majesty
for
what
i
tell
you
charles
burst
into
laughter
well
said
he
let
the
duc
de
guise
come
to
me
again
with
his
gossip
and
i
will
gently
pull
his
mustache
by
telling
him
of
the
exploits
of
his
but
after
all
said
the
king
thinking
better
of
it
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
monsieur
de
coconnas
or
monsieur
de
la
mole
he
referred
to
neither
the
one
more
than
the
other
sire
and
i
can
answer
to
you
for
the
feelings
of
my
wife
good
henriot
good
said
the
king
i
like
you
better
now
than
the
way
you
were
before
on
my
honor
you
are
such
a
good
fellow
that
i
shall
end
by
being
unable
to
get
along
without
you
as
he
spoke
the
king
gave
a
peculiar
whistle
whereupon
four
gentlemen
who
were
waiting
for
him
at
the
end
of
the
rue
de
beauvais
joined
him
the
whole
party
set
out
towards
the
middle
of
the
city
ten
struck
well
said
marguerite
after
the
king
and
henry
had
left
shall
we
go
back
to
table
mercy
no
cried
the
duchess
i
have
been
too
badly
frightened
long
live
the
little
house
in
the
rue
cloche
percée
no
one
can
enter
that
without
regularly
besieging
it
and
our
good
men
have
the
right
to
use
their
swords
there
but
what
are
you
looking
for
under
the
furniture
and
in
the
closets
monsieur
de
coconnas
i
am
trying
to
find
my
friend
la
mole
said
the
piedmontese
look
in
my
room
monsieur
said
marguerite
there
is
a
certain
closet
very
well
said
coconnas
i
will
go
there
he
entered
the
room
well
said
a
voice
from
the
darkness
where
are
we
oh
by
heaven
we
have
reached
the
dessert
and
the
king
of
navarre
he
has
seen
nothing
he
is
a
perfect
husband
and
i
wish
my
wife
had
one
like
him
but
i
fear
she
never
will
even
if
she
marries
again
and
king
charles
ah
the
king
that
is
another
thing
he
has
taken
off
the
husband
really
it
is
as
i
tell
you
furthermore
he
honored
me
by
looking
askance
at
me
when
he
discovered
that
i
belonged
to
monsieur
and
cross
when
he
found
out
that
i
was
your
friend
you
think
then
that
he
has
heard
me
spoken
of
i
fear
that
he
has
heard
nothing
very
good
of
you
but
that
is
not
the
point
i
believe
these
ladies
have
a
pilgrimage
to
make
to
the
rue
de
roi
de
sicile
and
that
we
are
to
take
them
there
why
that
is
impossible
you
know
that
very
well
how
impossible
we
are
on
duty
at
his
royal
highness
by
heavens
that
is
so
i
always
forget
that
we
are
ranked
and
that
from
the
gentlemen
we
once
were
we
have
had
the
honor
to
pass
into
valets
thereupon
the
two
friends
went
and
told
the
queen
and
the
duchess
the
necessity
of
their
being
present
at
least
when
monsieur
le
duc
retired
very
well
said
madame
de
nevers
we
will
go
by
ourselves
might
we
know
where
you
are
going
asked
coconnas
oh
you
are
too
curious
said
the
duchess
et
the
young
men
bowed
and
went
at
once
to
monsieur
the
duke
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
them
in
his
cabinet
ah
ah
said
he
you
are
very
late
gentlemen
it
is
scarcely
ten
monseigneur
said
coconnas
the
duke
drew
out
his
watch
that
is
true
said
he
and
yet
every
one
has
gone
to
sleep
in
the
louvre
yes
monsieur
but
we
are
here
at
your
orders
must
we
admit
into
the
chamber
of
your
highness
the
gentlemen
who
are
with
the
king
until
he
retires
on
the
contrary
go
into
the
small
and
dismiss
every
one
the
young
men
obeyed
carried
out
the
order
which
surprised
no
one
because
of
the
character
of
the
duke
and
returned
to
him
monseigneur
said
coconnas
your
highness
will
probably
either
go
to
bed
or
work
will
you
not
no
gentlemen
you
may
have
leave
of
absence
until
well
well
whispered
coconnas
into
la
mole
ear
the
court
is
going
to
stay
up
all
night
apparently
it
will
be
devilishly
pleasant
let
us
have
our
share
of
it
and
both
young
men
descended
the
stairs
four
steps
at
a
time
took
their
cloaks
and
their
night
swords
and
hastily
left
the
louvre
after
the
two
ladies
whom
they
overtook
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
du
coq
saint
honoré
meanwhile
the
duc
with
open
eyes
and
ears
locked
himself
in
his
room
to
await
the
unexpected
events
he
had
been
promised
chapter
xxxiv
man
proposes
but
god
disposes
as
the
duke
had
said
to
the
young
men
the
most
profound
silence
reigned
in
the
louvre
marguerite
and
madame
de
nevers
had
departed
for
the
rue
tizon
coconnas
and
la
mole
had
followed
them
the
king
and
henry
were
knocking
about
the
city
the
duc
was
in
his
room
vaguely
and
anxiously
waiting
for
the
events
which
the
queen
mother
had
predicted
catharine
had
gone
to
bed
and
madame
de
sauve
seated
by
her
was
reading
some
italian
stories
which
greatly
amused
the
good
queen
catharine
had
not
been
in
such
good
humor
for
a
long
time
having
done
justice
to
a
collation
with
her
ladies
in
waiting
having
consulted
her
physician
and
arranged
the
daily
accounts
of
her
household
she
had
ordered
prayers
for
the
success
of
a
certain
enterprise
which
she
said
was
of
great
importance
to
the
happiness
of
her
children
under
certain
circumstances
it
was
catharine
habit
a
habit
for
that
matter
wholly
florentine
to
have
prayers
and
masses
read
the
object
of
which
was
known
only
to
god
and
herself
finally
she
had
seen
réné
and
had
chosen
several
novelties
from
among
her
rich
collection
of
perfumed
bags
let
me
know
said
catharine
if
my
daughter
the
queen
of
navarre
is
in
her
rooms
and
if
she
is
there
beg
her
to
come
to
me
the
page
to
whom
this
order
was
given
withdrew
and
an
instant
later
he
returned
accompanied
by
gillonne
well
said
the
queen
mother
i
asked
for
the
mistress
not
the
servant
madame
said
gillonne
i
thought
i
ought
to
come
myself
and
tell
your
majesty
that
the
queen
of
navarre
has
gone
out
with
her
friend
the
duchesse
de
nevers
gone
out
at
this
hour
exclaimed
catharine
frowning
where
can
she
have
gone
to
a
lecture
on
chemistry
replied
gillonne
which
is
to
be
held
in
the
hôtel
de
guise
in
the
pavilion
occupied
by
madame
de
nevers
when
will
she
return
asked
the
queen
mother
the
lecture
will
last
until
late
into
the
night
replied
gillonne
so
that
probably
her
majesty
will
stay
with
her
friend
until
morning
the
queen
of
navarre
is
happy
murmured
catharine
she
has
friends
and
she
is
queen
she
wears
a
crown
is
called
your
majesty
yet
has
no
subjects
she
is
happy
indeed
after
this
remark
which
made
her
listeners
smile
inwardly
well
murmured
catharine
since
she
has
gone
out
for
she
has
gone
you
say
half
an
hour
ago
madame
everything
is
for
the
best
you
may
go
gillonne
bowed
and
left
go
on
with
your
reading
charlotte
said
the
queen
madame
de
sauve
continued
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
catharine
interrupted
the
story
ah
by
the
way
said
she
have
the
guards
dismissed
from
the
corridor
this
was
the
signal
for
which
maurevel
was
waiting
the
order
of
the
queen
mother
was
carried
out
and
madame
de
sauve
went
on
with
her
story
she
had
read
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
any
interruption
when
a
prolonged
and
terrible
scream
reached
the
royal
chamber
and
made
the
hair
of
those
present
stand
on
end
the
scream
was
followed
by
the
sound
of
a
what
is
it
said
catharine
why
do
you
stop
reading
carlotta
madame
said
the
young
woman
turning
pale
did
you
not
hear
what
asked
catharine
that
cry
and
that
added
the
captain
of
the
guards
a
cry
a
asked
catharine
i
heard
nothing
besides
is
a
shout
or
a
such
a
very
unusual
thing
at
the
louvre
read
read
carlotta
but
listen
madame
said
the
latter
while
monsieur
de
nancey
stood
up
his
hand
on
his
sword
but
not
daring
to
leave
without
permission
from
the
queen
listen
i
hear
steps
curses
shall
i
go
and
find
out
about
it
madame
said
de
nancey
not
at
all
monsieur
stay
where
you
are
said
catharine
raising
herself
on
one
hand
to
give
more
emphasis
to
her
order
who
then
would
protect
me
in
case
of
an
alarm
it
is
only
some
drunken
swiss
fighting
the
calmness
of
the
queen
contrasted
with
the
terror
on
the
faces
of
all
present
was
so
remarkable
that
timid
as
she
was
madame
de
sauve
fixed
a
questioning
glance
on
the
queen
why
madame
i
should
think
they
were
killing
some
one
whom
do
you
think
they
are
killing
the
king
of
navarre
madame
the
noise
comes
from
the
direction
of
his
apartments
the
fool
murmured
the
queen
whose
lips
in
spite
of
her
were
beginning
to
move
strangely
for
she
was
muttering
a
prayer
the
fool
sees
her
king
of
navarre
everywhere
my
god
my
god
cried
madame
de
sauve
falling
back
in
her
chair
it
is
over
it
is
over
said
catharine
captain
she
continued
turning
to
monsieur
de
nancey
i
hope
if
there
is
any
scandal
in
the
palace
you
will
have
the
guilty
ones
severely
punished
go
on
with
your
reading
carlotta
and
catharine
sank
back
on
her
pillow
with
a
calmness
that
greatly
resembled
weakness
for
those
present
noticed
great
drops
of
perspiration
rolling
down
her
face
madame
de
sauve
obeyed
this
formal
order
but
her
eyes
and
her
voice
were
mere
machines
her
thoughts
wandered
to
other
things
which
represented
a
terrible
danger
hanging
over
a
loved
head
finally
after
struggling
on
for
several
minutes
she
became
so
oppressed
between
her
feelings
and
etiquette
that
her
words
became
unintelligible
the
book
fell
from
her
hands
and
she
fainted
suddenly
a
louder
noise
was
heard
a
quick
heavy
step
fell
on
the
corridor
two
shook
the
windows
and
catharine
astonished
at
the
interminable
struggle
rose
in
terror
erect
pale
with
dilating
eyes
as
the
captain
of
the
guard
was
about
to
hurry
out
she
stopped
him
saying
let
every
one
remain
here
i
myself
will
go
and
see
what
is
the
matter
this
is
what
was
taking
place
or
rather
what
had
taken
place
that
morning
de
mouy
had
received
the
key
of
henry
room
from
the
hands
of
orthon
in
this
key
which
was
piped
he
had
noticed
a
roll
of
paper
he
drew
it
out
with
a
pin
it
was
the
password
of
the
louvre
for
that
night
besides
orthon
had
verbally
transmitted
to
him
the
words
of
henry
asking
de
mouy
to
come
to
the
king
at
ten
in
the
louvre
at
nine
de
mouy
put
on
a
suit
of
armor
the
strength
of
which
he
had
already
more
than
once
had
occasion
to
test
over
this
he
buttoned
a
silk
doublet
fastened
on
his
sword
put
his
pistols
in
his
belt
and
over
everything
threw
the
red
cloak
of
la
mole
we
have
seen
how
before
going
back
to
his
rooms
henry
had
thought
best
to
pay
a
visit
to
marguerite
and
how
he
arrived
by
the
secret
stairway
just
in
time
to
run
against
la
mole
in
marguerite
and
to
appear
in
the
before
the
king
it
was
at
that
very
moment
when
thanks
to
the
password
sent
by
henry
and
above
all
to
the
famous
red
cloak
that
de
mouy
passed
under
the
gate
of
the
louvre
the
young
man
went
directly
to
the
apartments
of
the
king
of
navarre
imitating
as
well
as
he
could
as
was
his
habit
the
gait
of
la
mole
he
found
orthon
waiting
for
him
in
the
antechamber
sire
de
mouy
said
the
mountaineer
the
king
has
gone
out
but
he
told
me
to
admit
you
and
to
tell
you
to
wait
for
him
if
he
should
be
late
in
returning
he
wants
you
you
know
to
lie
down
on
his
bed
de
mouy
entered
without
asking
for
further
explanation
for
what
orthon
had
just
told
him
was
only
the
repetition
of
what
he
had
already
heard
that
morning
in
order
to
pass
away
the
time
he
took
a
pen
and
ink
and
approaching
a
fine
map
of
france
which
hung
on
the
wall
he
set
to
work
to
count
and
determine
the
between
paris
and
pau
but
this
was
only
the
work
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
de
mouy
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
made
two
or
three
rounds
of
the
room
rubbed
his
eyes
yawned
sat
down
got
up
and
sat
down
again
finally
taking
advantage
of
invitation
and
the
familiarity
which
existed
between
princes
and
their
gentlemen
he
placed
his
pistols
and
the
lamp
on
a
table
stretched
himself
out
on
the
great
bed
with
the
sombre
hangings
which
furnished
the
rear
of
the
room
laid
his
sword
by
his
side
and
sure
of
not
being
surprised
since
a
servant
was
in
the
adjoining
room
he
fell
into
a
pleasant
sleep
the
noise
of
which
soon
made
the
vast
canopy
ring
with
its
echoes
de
mouy
snored
like
a
regular
old
soldier
and
in
this
he
could
have
vied
with
the
king
of
navarre
himself
it
was
then
that
six
men
their
swords
in
their
hands
and
their
knives
at
their
belts
glided
silently
into
the
corridor
which
communicated
by
a
small
door
with
the
apartments
of
catharine
and
by
a
large
one
with
those
of
henry
one
of
the
six
men
walked
ahead
of
the
others
besides
his
bare
sword
and
his
dagger
which
was
as
strong
as
a
he
carried
his
faithful
pistols
fastened
to
his
belt
by
silver
hooks
this
man
was
maurevel
having
reached
henry
door
he
stopped
are
you
perfectly
sure
that
the
sentinels
are
not
in
the
corridor
he
asked
of
the
one
who
apparently
commanded
the
little
band
not
a
single
one
is
at
his
post
replied
the
lieutenant
very
good
said
maurevel
now
there
is
nothing
further
except
to
find
out
one
thing
that
is
if
the
man
we
are
looking
for
is
in
his
room
but
said
the
lieutenant
arresting
the
hand
which
maurevel
had
laid
on
the
handle
of
the
door
but
captain
these
apartments
are
those
of
the
king
of
navarre
who
said
they
were
not
asked
maurevel
the
guards
looked
at
one
another
in
amazement
and
the
lieutenant
stepped
back
what
exclaimed
he
arrest
some
one
at
this
hour
in
the
louvre
and
in
the
apartments
of
the
king
of
navarre
what
should
you
say
said
maurevel
were
i
to
tell
you
that
the
one
you
are
about
to
arrest
is
the
king
of
navarre
himself
i
should
say
captain
that
it
is
serious
business
and
that
without
an
order
signed
by
king
charles
ix
read
this
said
maurevel
and
drawing
from
his
doublet
the
order
which
catharine
had
given
him
he
handed
it
to
the
lieutenant
very
well
replied
the
latter
after
he
had
read
it
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
and
you
are
ready
i
am
ready
and
you
continued
maurevel
turning
to
the
other
five
sbirros
they
all
saluted
respectfully
listen
to
me
then
gentlemen
said
maurevel
this
is
my
plan
two
of
you
will
remain
at
this
door
two
at
the
door
of
the
and
two
will
go
with
me
afterwards
said
the
lieutenant
pay
close
attention
to
this
we
are
ordered
to
prevent
the
prisoner
from
calling
out
shouting
or
resisting
any
infraction
of
this
order
is
to
be
punished
by
death
well
well
he
has
full
permission
said
the
lieutenant
to
the
man
chosen
by
him
to
follow
maurevel
into
the
king
room
full
said
maurevel
poor
devil
of
the
king
of
navarre
said
one
of
the
men
it
was
written
above
that
he
should
not
escape
this
and
here
too
said
maurevel
taking
catharine
order
from
the
hands
of
the
lieutenant
and
returning
it
to
his
breast
maurevel
inserted
the
key
catharine
had
given
him
into
the
lock
and
leaving
two
men
at
the
outer
door
as
had
been
agreed
on
he
entered
the
antechamber
with
the
four
others
ah
ah
said
maurevel
hearing
the
noisy
breathing
of
the
sleeper
the
sound
of
which
reached
even
as
far
as
that
it
seems
that
we
shall
find
what
we
are
looking
for
orthon
thinking
it
was
his
master
returning
at
once
started
up
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
five
armed
men
in
the
first
chamber
at
sight
of
the
sinister
face
of
maurevel
who
was
called
the
slayer
the
faithful
servant
sprang
back
and
placing
himself
before
the
second
door
who
are
you
said
he
and
what
do
you
want
in
the
king
name
replied
maurevel
where
is
your
master
my
master
yes
the
king
of
navarre
the
king
of
navarre
is
not
in
his
room
said
orthon
barring
the
door
more
than
ever
so
you
can
not
enter
excuses
lies
said
maurevel
come
stand
back
the
béarnais
people
are
stubborn
this
one
growled
like
one
of
his
own
mountain
dogs
and
far
from
being
intimidated
you
shall
not
enter
said
he
the
king
is
out
and
he
clung
to
the
door
maurevel
made
a
sign
the
four
men
seized
the
stubborn
servant
snatched
him
from
the
to
which
he
was
clinging
and
as
he
started
to
open
his
mouth
and
cry
out
maurevel
clapped
a
hand
to
his
lips
orthon
bit
furiously
at
the
assassin
who
dropped
his
hand
with
a
dull
cry
and
brought
down
the
handle
of
his
sword
on
the
head
of
the
servant
orthon
staggered
and
fell
back
shouting
help
help
help
then
his
voice
died
away
he
had
fainted
the
assassins
stepped
over
his
body
two
stopped
at
the
second
door
and
two
entered
the
with
maurevel
in
the
glow
of
the
lamp
burning
on
the
night
table
they
saw
the
bed
the
curtains
were
drawn
oh
oh
said
the
lieutenant
he
has
stopped
snoring
apparently
be
quick
cried
maurevel
at
this
a
sharp
cry
resembling
the
roar
of
a
lion
rather
than
a
human
voice
came
from
behind
the
curtains
which
were
violently
thrown
back
and
a
man
appeared
sitting
there
armed
with
a
cuirass
his
head
covered
with
a
helmet
which
reached
to
his
eyes
two
pistols
were
in
his
hand
and
his
sword
lay
across
his
knees
no
sooner
did
maurevel
perceive
this
figure
and
recognize
de
mouy
than
he
felt
his
hair
rise
on
end
he
became
frightfully
pale
foam
sprang
to
his
lips
and
he
stepped
back
as
if
he
had
come
face
to
face
with
a
ghost
suddenly
the
armed
figure
rose
and
stepped
forward
as
maurevel
drew
back
so
that
from
the
position
of
threatener
the
latter
now
became
the
one
threatened
and
ah
scoundrel
cried
de
mouy
in
a
dull
voice
so
you
have
come
to
murder
me
as
you
murdered
my
father
the
two
guards
who
had
entered
the
room
with
maurevel
alone
heard
these
terrible
words
as
they
were
uttered
a
pistol
was
placed
to
forehead
the
latter
sank
to
his
knees
just
as
de
mouy
put
his
hand
on
the
trigger
the
shot
was
fired
and
one
of
the
guards
who
stood
behind
him
and
whom
he
had
unmasked
by
this
movement
dropped
to
the
floor
struck
to
the
heart
at
the
same
instant
maurevel
fired
back
but
the
ball
glanced
off
de
mouy
cuirass
then
measuring
the
distance
de
mouy
sprang
forward
and
with
the
edge
of
his
broadsword
split
open
the
head
of
the
second
guard
and
turning
towards
maurevel
crossed
swords
with
him
the
struggle
was
brief
but
terrible
at
the
fourth
pass
maurevel
felt
the
cold
steel
in
his
throat
he
uttered
a
stifled
cry
and
fell
backwards
upsetting
the
lamp
which
went
out
in
the
fall
at
once
de
mouy
strong
and
agile
as
one
of
homer
heroes
took
advantage
of
the
darkness
and
sprang
with
head
lowered
into
the
antechamber
knocked
down
one
guard
pushed
aside
the
other
and
shot
like
an
arrow
between
those
at
the
outer
door
he
escaped
two
the
balls
of
which
grazed
the
wall
of
the
corridor
and
from
that
moment
was
safe
for
one
loaded
pistol
still
was
left
him
besides
the
sword
which
had
dealt
such
terrible
blows
for
an
instant
he
hesitated
undecided
whether
to
go
to
monsieur
the
door
of
whose
room
he
thought
had
just
opened
or
to
try
and
escape
from
the
louvre
he
determined
on
the
latter
course
continued
on
his
way
slow
at
first
jumped
ten
steps
at
a
time
and
reaching
the
gate
uttered
the
two
passwords
and
rushed
on
shouting
out
go
upstairs
there
is
murder
going
on
by
order
of
the
king
taking
advantage
of
the
amazement
produced
on
the
sentinel
by
his
words
and
the
sound
of
the
he
ran
on
and
disappeared
in
the
rue
du
coq
without
having
received
a
scratch
it
was
at
this
moment
that
catharine
stopped
the
captain
of
the
guards
saying
stay
here
i
myself
will
go
and
see
what
is
the
matter
but
madame
replied
the
captain
the
danger
your
majesty
runs
compels
me
to
follow
you
stay
here
monsieur
said
catharine
in
a
still
more
imperious
tone
stay
here
there
is
a
more
powerful
protection
around
kings
than
the
human
sword
the
captain
remained
where
he
was
taking
a
lamp
catharine
slipped
her
bare
feet
into
a
pair
of
velvet
slippers
left
her
room
and
reaching
the
corridor
still
full
of
smoke
advanced
as
impassible
and
as
cold
as
a
shadow
towards
the
apartments
of
the
king
of
navarre
silence
reigned
supreme
catharine
reached
the
door
crossed
the
threshold
and
first
saw
orthon
who
had
fainted
in
the
antechamber
ah
ah
said
she
here
is
the
servant
further
on
we
shall
probably
find
the
master
she
entered
the
second
door
then
her
foot
ran
against
a
corpse
she
lowered
her
lamp
it
was
the
guard
who
had
had
his
head
split
open
he
was
quite
dead
a
few
feet
further
on
the
lieutenant
who
had
been
struck
by
a
bullet
was
drawing
his
last
breath
finally
before
the
bed
lay
a
man
whose
face
was
as
pale
as
death
and
who
was
bleeding
from
a
double
wound
in
his
throat
he
was
clinching
his
hands
convulsively
in
his
efforts
to
rise
it
was
maurevel
catharine
shuddered
she
saw
the
empty
bed
she
looked
around
the
room
seeking
in
vain
for
the
body
she
hoped
to
find
among
the
three
corpses
maurevel
recognized
catharine
his
eyes
were
horribly
dilated
and
he
made
a
despairing
gesture
towards
her
well
said
she
in
a
whisper
where
is
he
what
has
happened
unfortunate
man
have
you
let
him
escape
maurevel
strove
to
speak
but
an
unintelligible
sound
came
from
his
throat
a
bloody
foam
covered
his
lips
and
he
shook
his
head
in
sign
of
inability
and
pain
speak
cried
catharine
speak
if
only
one
word
maurevel
pointed
to
his
wound
again
made
several
inarticulate
gasps
which
ended
in
a
hoarse
rattle
and
fainted
catharine
looked
around
her
she
was
surrounded
by
the
bodies
of
dead
and
dying
blood
flowed
in
every
direction
and
the
silence
of
death
hovered
over
everything
once
again
she
spoke
to
maurevel
but
failed
to
rouse
him
he
was
not
only
silent
but
motionless
a
paper
was
in
his
doublet
it
was
the
order
of
arrest
signed
by
the
king
catharine
seized
it
and
hid
it
in
her
breast
just
then
she
heard
a
light
step
behind
her
and
turning
she
saw
the
duc
at
the
door
in
spite
of
himself
he
had
been
drawn
thither
by
the
noise
and
the
sight
before
him
fascinated
him
you
here
said
she
yes
madame
for
god
sake
what
has
happened
go
back
to
your
room
françois
you
will
know
soon
enough
was
not
as
ignorant
of
the
affair
as
catharine
supposed
at
the
sound
of
the
first
steps
in
the
corridor
he
had
listened
seeing
some
men
enter
the
apartments
of
the
king
of
navarre
and
by
connecting
this
with
some
words
catharine
had
uttered
he
had
guessed
what
was
about
to
take
place
and
was
rejoiced
at
having
so
dangerous
an
enemy
destroyed
by
a
hand
stronger
than
his
own
before
long
the
noises
of
and
the
rapid
steps
of
a
man
running
had
attracted
his
attention
and
he
had
seen
disappearing
in
the
light
space
caused
by
the
opening
of
the
door
leading
to
the
stairway
the
red
cloak
too
well
known
not
to
be
recognized
de
mouy
he
cried
de
mouy
in
the
apartments
of
the
king
of
navarre
why
that
is
impossible
can
it
be
monsieur
de
la
mole
he
grew
alarmed
remembering
that
the
young
man
had
been
recommended
to
him
by
marguerite
herself
and
wishing
to
make
sure
that
it
was
he
whom
he
had
just
seen
he
ascended
hurriedly
to
the
chamber
of
the
two
young
men
it
was
vacant
but
in
a
corner
he
found
the
famous
red
cloak
hanging
against
the
wall
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
it
was
not
la
mole
but
de
mouy
pale
and
trembling
lest
the
huguenot
should
be
discovered
and
would
betray
the
secrets
of
the
conspiracy
he
rushed
to
the
gate
of
the
louvre
there
he
was
told
that
the
red
cloak
had
escaped
safe
and
sound
shouting
out
as
he
passed
that
some
one
was
being
murdered
in
the
louvre
by
order
of
the
king
he
is
mistaken
murmured
it
is
by
order
of
the
queen
mother
returning
to
the
scene
of
combat
he
found
catharine
wandering
like
a
hyena
among
the
dead
at
the
order
from
his
mother
the
young
man
returned
to
his
rooms
affecting
calmness
and
obedience
in
spite
of
the
tumultuous
thoughts
which
were
passing
through
his
mind
in
despair
at
the
failure
of
this
new
attempt
catharine
called
the
captain
of
the
guards
had
the
bodies
removed
gave
orders
that
maurevel
who
was
only
wounded
be
carried
to
his
home
and
told
them
not
to
waken
the
king
oh
she
murmured
as
she
returned
to
her
rooms
her
head
sunk
on
her
bosom
he
has
again
escaped
the
hand
of
god
is
over
this
man
he
will
reign
he
will
reign
entering
her
room
she
passed
her
hand
across
her
brow
and
assumed
an
ordinary
smile
what
was
the
matter
madame
asked
every
one
except
madame
de
sauve
who
was
too
frightened
to
ask
any
questions
nothing
replied
catharine
a
noise
that
was
all
oh
cried
madame
de
sauve
suddenly
pointing
to
the
floor
your
majesty
says
there
is
nothing
the
matter
and
every
one
of
your
majesty
steps
leaves
a
trace
of
blood
on
the
carpet
chapter
xxxv
a
night
of
kings
charles
ix
walked
along
with
henry
leaning
on
his
arm
followed
by
his
four
gentlemen
and
preceded
by
two
when
i
leave
the
louvre
said
the
poor
king
i
feel
a
pleasure
similar
to
that
which
comes
to
me
when
i
enter
a
beautiful
forest
i
breathe
i
live
i
am
free
henry
smiled
in
that
case
said
he
your
majesty
would
be
in
your
element
among
the
mountains
of
the
béarn
yes
and
i
understand
that
you
want
to
go
back
to
them
but
if
you
are
very
anxious
to
do
so
henriot
added
charles
laughing
my
advice
is
to
be
careful
for
my
mother
catharine
loves
you
so
dearly
that
it
is
absolutely
impossible
for
her
to
get
along
without
you
what
does
your
majesty
plan
to
do
this
evening
asked
henry
changing
this
dangerous
conversation
i
want
to
have
you
meet
some
one
henriot
and
you
shall
give
me
your
opinion
i
am
at
your
majesty
orders
to
the
right
to
the
right
we
will
take
the
rue
des
barres
the
two
kings
followed
by
their
escort
had
passed
the
rue
de
la
savonnerie
when
in
front
of
the
hôtel
de
condé
they
saw
two
men
wrapped
in
large
cloaks
coming
out
of
a
secret
door
which
one
of
them
noiselessly
closed
behind
him
oh
oh
said
the
king
to
henry
who
as
usual
had
seen
everything
but
had
not
spoken
this
deserves
attention
why
do
you
say
that
sire
asked
the
king
of
navarre
it
is
not
on
your
account
henriot
you
are
sure
of
your
wife
added
charles
with
a
smile
but
your
cousin
de
condé
is
not
sure
of
his
or
if
so
he
is
making
a
mistake
the
devil
but
how
do
you
know
sire
that
it
is
madame
de
condé
whom
these
gentlemen
have
been
visiting
instinct
tells
me
the
fact
that
the
men
stood
in
the
doorway
without
moving
until
they
saw
us
then
the
cut
of
the
shorter
one
cloak
by
heaven
that
would
be
strange
what
nothing
an
idea
i
had
that
is
all
let
us
go
on
he
walked
up
to
the
two
men
who
seeing
him
started
to
walk
away
hello
gentlemen
cried
the
king
stop
are
you
speaking
to
us
asked
a
voice
which
made
charles
and
his
companion
tremble
well
henriot
said
charles
do
you
recognize
the
voice
now
sire
said
henry
if
your
brother
the
duc
was
not
at
la
rochelle
i
would
swear
it
was
he
speaking
well
said
charles
he
is
not
at
la
rochelle
that
is
all
but
who
is
with
him
do
you
not
recognize
his
companion
no
sire
yet
his
figure
is
unmistakable
wait
you
shall
see
who
he
is
hello
there
i
tell
you
cried
the
king
do
you
not
hear
by
heaven
are
you
the
watch
that
you
order
us
to
stop
said
the
taller
of
the
two
men
freeing
his
arm
from
the
folds
of
his
cloak
pretend
that
we
are
the
watch
said
the
king
and
stop
when
we
tell
you
to
do
so
leaning
over
to
henry
ear
he
added
now
you
will
see
the
volcano
send
forth
its
fire
there
are
eight
of
you
said
the
taller
of
the
two
men
this
time
showing
not
only
his
arm
but
his
face
but
were
you
a
hundred
pass
on
ah
ah
the
duc
de
guise
said
henry
ah
our
cousin
from
lorraine
said
the
king
at
last
you
will
meet
how
fortunate
the
king
cried
the
duke
at
these
words
the
other
man
covered
himself
with
his
cloak
and
stood
motionless
having
first
uncovered
out
of
respect
sire
said
the
duc
de
guise
i
have
just
been
paying
a
visit
to
my
madame
de
condé
yes
and
you
brought
one
of
your
gentlemen
with
you
which
one
sire
replied
the
duke
your
majesty
does
not
know
him
we
will
meet
him
however
said
the
king
walking
up
to
the
other
figure
he
signed
to
one
of
the
lackeys
to
bring
a
torch
pardon
me
brother
said
the
duc
opening
his
cloak
and
bowing
with
poorly
disguised
anger
ah
ah
henry
is
it
you
but
no
it
is
not
possible
i
am
mistaken
my
brother
of
anjou
would
not
have
gone
to
see
any
one
else
before
first
calling
on
me
he
knows
that
for
royal
princes
returning
to
the
capital
paris
has
but
one
entrance
the
gate
of
the
louvre
pardon
me
sire
said
the
duc
i
beg
your
majesty
to
excuse
my
thoughtlessness
ah
yes
replied
the
king
mockingly
and
what
were
you
doing
brother
at
the
hôtel
de
condé
why
said
the
king
of
navarre
in
his
sly
way
what
your
majesty
intimated
just
now
and
leaning
over
to
the
king
he
ended
his
sentence
in
a
burst
of
laughter
what
is
it
asked
the
duc
de
guise
haughtily
for
like
every
one
else
at
court
he
had
a
way
of
treating
the
poor
king
of
navarre
very
rudely
why
should
i
not
go
and
see
my
does
not
monsieur
le
duc
visit
his
henry
flushed
slightly
what
asked
charles
i
know
none
except
queen
elizabeth
pardon
sire
it
was
your
sister
i
should
have
said
madame
marguerite
whom
we
saw
pass
in
her
litter
as
we
came
by
here
half
an
hour
ago
she
was
accompanied
by
two
courtiers
who
rode
on
either
side
of
her
indeed
said
charles
what
do
you
say
to
that
henry
that
the
queen
of
navarre
is
perfectly
free
to
go
where
she
pleases
but
i
doubt
if
she
has
left
the
louvre
well
i
am
sure
she
did
said
the
duc
de
guise
and
i
too
said
the
duc
from
the
fact
that
the
litter
stopped
in
the
rue
cloche
percée
your
not
this
one
said
henry
pointing
to
the
hôtel
de
condé
but
that
one
turning
in
the
direction
of
the
hôtel
de
guise
must
also
be
of
the
party
for
we
left
them
together
and
as
you
know
they
are
inseparable
i
do
not
know
what
your
majesty
means
replied
the
duc
de
guise
on
the
contrary
said
the
king
nothing
is
simpler
that
is
why
a
courtier
was
riding
at
either
side
of
the
litter
well
said
the
duke
if
there
is
any
scandal
concerning
my
let
us
beg
the
king
to
withhold
justice
well
by
heaven
said
henry
let
us
leave
madame
de
condé
and
madame
de
nevers
the
king
is
not
anxious
about
his
sister
and
i
have
confidence
in
my
wife
no
no
said
charles
i
want
to
make
sure
of
it
but
let
us
attend
to
the
matter
ourselves
the
litter
stopped
in
the
rue
cloche
percée
you
say
cousin
yes
sire
do
you
know
the
house
yes
sire
well
let
us
go
to
it
and
if
in
order
to
find
out
who
is
in
it
it
is
necessary
to
burn
it
down
we
will
burn
it
it
was
with
this
end
in
view
which
was
rather
discouraging
for
the
tranquillity
of
those
concerned
that
the
four
chief
lords
of
the
christian
world
set
out
to
the
rue
saint
antoine
they
reached
the
rue
cloche
percée
charles
who
wished
to
work
privately
dismissed
the
gentlemen
of
his
suite
saying
that
they
might
have
the
rest
of
the
night
to
themselves
but
for
them
to
be
at
the
bastille
with
two
horses
at
six
in
the
morning
there
were
only
three
houses
in
the
rue
cloche
percée
the
search
was
much
less
difficult
as
two
of
the
buildings
were
perfectly
willing
to
open
their
doors
one
of
the
houses
faced
the
rue
saint
antoine
and
the
other
the
rue
du
roi
de
sicile
as
to
the
third
house
that
was
a
different
matter
it
was
the
one
which
was
guarded
by
the
german
janitor
and
this
janitor
was
not
easily
managed
that
night
paris
seemed
destined
to
offer
memorable
examples
of
conjugal
fidelity
in
vain
did
monsieur
de
guise
threaten
in
his
purest
saxon
in
vain
did
henry
of
anjou
offer
a
purse
filled
with
gold
in
vain
charles
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
was
lieutenant
of
the
watch
the
brave
german
paid
attention
neither
to
the
statement
the
offer
nor
the
threats
seeing
that
they
insisted
and
in
a
way
that
was
becoming
importunate
he
slipped
the
nose
of
a
gun
under
the
iron
bars
a
move
which
brought
forth
bursts
of
laughter
from
three
of
the
four
visitors
henry
of
navarre
stood
apart
as
if
the
affair
had
no
interest
for
him
but
as
the
weapon
could
not
be
turned
between
the
bars
it
was
scarcely
dangerous
for
any
except
a
blind
man
who
might
stand
directly
in
front
of
it
seeing
that
the
porter
was
neither
to
be
intimidated
bribed
nor
persuaded
the
duc
de
guise
pretended
to
leave
with
his
companions
but
the
retreat
did
not
last
long
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
saint
antoine
the
duke
found
what
he
sought
this
was
a
rock
similar
in
size
to
those
which
three
thousand
years
before
had
been
moved
by
ajax
son
of
telamon
and
diomed
the
duke
raised
it
to
his
shoulder
and
came
back
signing
to
his
companions
to
follow
just
then
the
janitor
who
had
seen
those
he
took
for
malefactors
depart
closed
the
door
but
he
had
not
time
to
draw
the
bolts
before
the
duc
de
guise
took
advantage
of
the
moment
and
hurled
his
veritable
living
catapult
against
the
door
the
lock
broke
carrying
away
a
portion
of
the
wall
to
which
it
had
been
fastened
the
door
sprang
open
knocking
down
the
german
who
in
falling
gave
a
terrible
cry
this
cry
awakened
the
garrison
which
otherwise
would
have
run
great
risk
of
being
surprised
at
that
moment
la
mole
and
marguerite
were
translating
an
idyl
of
theocritus
and
coconnas
pretending
that
he
too
was
a
greek
was
drinking
some
strong
wine
from
syracuse
with
henriette
the
scientific
and
bacchanalian
conversation
was
violently
interrupted
la
mole
and
coconnas
at
once
extinguished
the
candles
and
opening
the
windows
sprang
out
on
the
balcony
then
perceiving
four
men
in
the
darkness
they
set
to
work
to
hurl
at
them
everything
they
had
at
hand
in
the
meantime
making
a
frightful
noise
with
blows
from
the
flat
of
their
swords
which
however
struck
nothing
but
the
wall
charles
the
most
infuriated
of
the
besiegers
received
a
sharp
blow
on
the
shoulder
the
duc
a
bowl
full
of
orange
and
lemon
marmalade
and
the
duc
de
guise
a
leg
of
venison
henry
received
nothing
he
was
downstairs
questioning
the
porter
whom
monsieur
de
guise
had
strapped
to
the
door
and
who
continued
to
answer
by
his
eternal
verstehe
the
women
encouraged
the
besieged
by
handing
them
projectiles
which
succeeded
one
another
like
hailstones
the
devil
exclaimed
charles
as
a
table
struck
his
head
driving
his
hat
over
his
eyes
if
they
do
open
the
door
pretty
soon
i
will
have
them
all
hanged
my
brother
whispered
marguerite
to
la
mole
the
king
cried
the
latter
to
henriette
the
king
the
king
repeated
henriette
to
coconnas
who
was
dragging
a
chest
to
the
window
and
who
was
trying
to
exterminate
the
duc
de
guise
without
knowing
who
the
latter
was
he
was
having
a
private
struggle
with
him
the
king
i
tell
you
repeated
henriette
coconnas
let
go
of
the
chest
and
looked
up
in
amazement
the
king
said
he
yes
the
king
then
let
us
hide
yes
la
mole
and
marguerite
have
already
fled
come
where
come
i
tell
you
and
seizing
him
by
the
hand
henriette
pushed
coconnas
through
the
secret
door
which
connected
with
the
adjoining
house
and
all
four
having
locked
this
door
behind
them
escaped
into
the
rue
tizon
oh
oh
said
charles
i
think
that
the
garrison
has
surrendered
they
waited
a
few
minutes
no
sound
reached
the
besiegers
they
are
preparing
some
ruse
said
the
duc
de
guise
it
is
more
likely
that
they
have
recognized
my
brother
voice
and
have
fled
said
the
duc
they
would
have
to
pass
by
here
said
charles
yes
said
the
duc
unless
the
house
has
two
exits
cousin
said
the
king
take
up
your
stone
again
and
hurl
it
against
the
other
door
as
you
did
at
this
the
duke
thought
it
unnecessary
to
resort
to
such
means
and
as
he
had
noticed
that
the
second
door
was
not
as
solid
as
the
first
he
broke
it
down
by
a
simple
kick
the
torches
the
torches
cried
the
king
the
lackeys
approached
the
torches
were
out
but
the
men
had
everything
necessary
for
relighting
them
this
was
done
charles
ix
took
one
and
handed
the
other
to
the
duc
the
duc
de
guise
entered
first
sword
in
hand
henry
brought
up
the
rear
they
reached
the
first
floor
in
the
the
table
was
set
or
rather
upset
for
it
was
the
supper
which
had
furnished
the
projectiles
the
candlesticks
were
overturned
the
furniture
and
everything
which
was
not
silver
plate
lay
in
fragments
they
entered
the
but
found
no
more
clue
there
than
in
the
other
room
as
to
the
identity
of
the
revellers
some
greek
and
latin
books
and
several
musical
instruments
were
all
they
saw
the
was
more
silent
still
a
night
lamp
burned
in
an
alabaster
globe
suspended
from
the
ceiling
but
it
was
evident
that
the
room
had
not
been
occupied
there
is
a
second
door
said
the
king
very
likely
said
the
duc
but
where
is
it
asked
the
duc
de
guise
they
looked
everywhere
but
could
not
find
it
where
is
the
janitor
asked
the
king
i
bound
him
to
the
gate
said
the
duc
de
guise
ask
him
cousin
he
will
not
answer
bah
we
will
have
a
dry
fire
built
around
his
legs
said
the
king
laughing
then
he
will
speak
henry
glanced
hurriedly
out
of
the
window
he
is
not
there
said
he
who
untied
him
asked
the
duc
de
guise
quickly
the
devil
exclaimed
the
king
and
we
know
nothing
as
yet
well
said
henry
you
see
very
clearly
sire
that
there
is
nothing
to
prove
that
my
wife
and
monsieur
de
guise
have
been
in
this
house
that
is
so
said
charles
the
scriptures
tell
us
that
there
are
three
things
which
leave
no
trace
the
bird
in
the
air
the
fish
in
the
sea
and
the
woman
no
i
am
wrong
the
man
in
so
interrupted
henry
what
we
had
better
do
is
yes
said
charles
what
we
had
better
do
is
for
me
to
look
after
my
bruise
for
you
to
wipe
off
your
orange
marmalade
and
for
you
de
guise
to
get
rid
of
the
grease
thereupon
they
left
without
even
troubling
to
close
the
door
reaching
the
rue
saint
antoine
where
are
you
bound
for
gentlemen
asked
the
king
of
the
duc
and
the
duc
de
guise
sire
we
are
going
to
the
house
of
nantouillet
who
is
expecting
my
lorraine
cousin
and
myself
to
supper
will
your
majesty
come
with
us
no
thanks
we
are
going
in
a
different
direction
will
you
take
one
of
my
thank
you
no
sire
said
the
duc
hastily
good
he
is
afraid
i
will
spy
on
him
whispered
charles
to
the
king
of
navarre
then
taking
the
latter
by
the
arm
come
henriot
said
he
i
will
take
you
to
supper
are
we
not
going
back
to
the
louvre
asked
henry
no
i
tell
you
you
stupid
come
with
me
since
i
tell
you
to
come
come
and
he
dragged
henry
down
the
rue
geoffroy
lasnier
chapter
xxxvi
the
anagram
the
rue
garnier
sur
runs
into
the
rue
geoffroy
lasnier
and
the
rue
des
barres
lies
at
right
angles
to
the
former
on
the
right
a
short
distance
down
the
rue
de
la
mortellerie
stands
a
small
house
in
the
centre
of
a
garden
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
which
has
but
one
entrance
charles
drew
a
key
from
his
pocket
and
inserted
it
into
the
lock
the
gate
was
unbolted
and
immediately
opened
telling
henry
and
the
lackey
bearing
the
torch
to
enter
the
king
closed
and
locked
the
gate
behind
him
light
came
from
one
small
window
which
charles
smilingly
pointed
out
to
henry
sire
i
do
not
understand
said
the
latter
but
you
will
henriot
the
king
of
navarre
looked
at
charles
in
amazement
his
voice
and
his
face
had
assumed
an
expression
of
gentleness
so
different
from
usual
that
henry
scarcely
recognized
him
henriot
said
the
king
i
told
you
that
when
i
left
the
louvre
i
came
out
of
hell
when
i
enter
here
i
am
in
paradise
sire
said
henry
i
am
happy
that
your
majesty
has
thought
me
worthy
of
taking
this
trip
to
heaven
with
you
the
road
thither
is
a
narrow
one
said
the
king
turning
to
a
small
stairway
but
nothing
can
be
compared
to
it
who
is
the
angel
who
guards
the
entrance
to
your
eden
sire
you
shall
see
replied
charles
ix
signing
to
henry
to
follow
him
noiselessly
he
opened
first
one
door
then
another
and
finally
paused
on
a
threshold
look
said
he
henry
approached
and
gazed
on
one
of
the
most
beautiful
pictures
he
had
ever
seen
a
young
woman
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
lay
sleeping
her
head
resting
on
the
foot
of
a
little
bed
in
which
a
child
was
asleep
the
woman
held
its
little
feet
close
to
her
lips
while
her
long
hair
fell
over
her
shoulders
like
a
flood
of
gold
it
was
like
one
of
albane
pictures
of
the
virgin
and
the
child
jesus
oh
sire
said
the
king
of
navarre
who
is
this
lovely
creature
the
angel
of
my
paradise
henriot
the
only
one
who
loves
me
henry
smiled
yes
said
charles
for
she
loved
me
before
she
knew
i
was
king
and
since
she
has
known
it
well
since
she
has
known
it
said
charles
with
a
smile
which
showed
that
royalty
sometimes
weighed
heavily
on
him
since
she
has
known
it
she
loves
me
still
so
you
may
judge
the
king
approached
the
woman
softly
and
pressed
a
kiss
as
light
as
that
which
a
bee
gives
to
a
lily
on
her
rosy
cheek
yet
light
as
it
was
she
awakened
at
once
charles
she
murmured
opening
her
eyes
you
see
said
the
king
she
calls
me
charles
the
queen
says
oh
cried
the
young
woman
you
are
not
alone
my
king
no
my
sweet
marie
i
wanted
to
bring
you
another
king
happier
than
myself
because
he
has
no
crown
more
unhappy
than
i
because
he
has
no
marie
touchet
god
makes
compensation
for
everything
sire
is
it
the
king
of
navarre
asked
marie
yes
my
child
come
here
henriot
the
king
of
navarre
drew
near
charles
took
him
by
the
hand
see
this
hand
marie
said
he
it
is
the
hand
of
a
good
brother
and
a
loyal
friend
were
it
not
for
this
hand
well
sire
well
had
it
not
been
for
this
hand
marie
our
child
would
have
no
father
marie
uttered
a
cry
fell
on
her
knees
and
seizing
henry
hand
covered
it
with
kisses
very
good
marie
very
good
said
charles
what
have
you
done
to
thank
him
sire
i
have
done
for
him
what
he
did
for
me
henry
looked
at
charles
in
astonishment
some
day
you
will
know
what
i
mean
henriot
meanwhile
come
here
and
see
he
approached
the
bed
on
which
the
child
still
slept
ah
said
he
if
this
little
fellow
were
in
the
louvre
instead
of
here
in
this
little
house
in
the
rue
des
barres
many
things
would
be
changed
for
the
present
as
well
as
for
the
future
perhaps
sire
said
marie
if
your
majesty
is
willing
i
prefer
him
to
stay
here
he
sleeps
better
let
us
not
disturb
his
slumber
then
said
the
king
it
is
so
sweet
to
sleep
when
one
does
not
dream
well
sire
said
marie
pointing
to
a
door
opening
out
of
the
room
yes
you
are
right
marie
said
charles
let
us
have
supper
my
charles
said
marie
you
will
ask
the
king
your
brother
to
excuse
me
will
you
not
why
for
having
dismissed
our
servants
sire
continued
marie
turning
to
the
king
of
navarre
you
must
know
that
charles
wants
to
be
served
by
me
alone
saint
gris
said
henry
i
should
think
so
both
men
entered
the
the
mother
anxious
and
careful
laid
a
warm
blanket
over
the
little
charles
who
thanks
to
the
sound
sleep
of
childhood
so
envied
by
his
father
had
not
wakened
marie
rejoined
them
there
are
only
two
covers
said
the
king
permit
me
said
marie
to
serve
your
majesties
now
said
charles
this
is
where
you
cause
me
trouble
henriot
how
so
sire
did
you
not
hear
forgive
me
charles
forgive
me
yes
i
will
forgive
you
but
sit
here
near
me
between
us
i
will
obey
said
marie
she
brought
a
plate
sat
down
between
the
two
kings
and
served
them
is
it
not
good
henriot
said
charles
to
have
one
place
in
the
world
in
which
one
can
eat
and
drink
without
needing
any
one
to
taste
the
meats
and
wines
beforehand
sire
said
henry
smiling
and
by
the
smile
replying
to
the
constant
fear
in
his
own
mind
believe
me
i
appreciate
your
happiness
more
than
any
one
and
tell
her
henriot
that
in
order
for
us
to
live
happily
she
must
not
mingle
in
politics
above
all
she
must
not
become
acquainted
with
my
mother
queen
catharine
loves
your
majesty
so
passionately
that
she
would
be
jealous
of
any
other
love
replied
henry
finding
by
a
subterfuge
the
means
of
avoiding
the
dangerous
confidence
of
the
king
marie
said
the
latter
i
have
brought
you
one
of
the
finest
and
the
wittiest
men
i
know
at
court
you
see
and
this
is
saying
a
great
deal
he
puts
every
one
in
the
shade
i
alone
have
clearly
understood
not
his
heart
perhaps
but
his
mind
sire
said
henry
i
am
sorry
that
in
exaggerating
the
one
as
you
do
you
mistrust
the
other
i
exaggerate
nothing
henriot
said
the
king
besides
you
will
be
known
some
day
then
turning
to
the
young
woman
he
makes
delightful
anagrams
ask
him
to
make
one
of
your
name
i
will
answer
that
he
will
do
it
oh
what
could
you
expect
to
find
in
the
name
of
a
poor
girl
like
me
what
gentle
thought
could
there
be
in
the
letters
with
which
chance
spelled
marie
touchet
oh
the
anagram
from
this
name
sire
said
henry
is
so
easy
that
there
is
no
great
merit
in
finding
it
ah
ah
it
is
already
found
said
charles
you
see
marie
henry
drew
his
tablets
from
the
pocket
of
his
doublet
tore
out
a
paper
and
below
the
name
wrote
charme
then
he
handed
the
paper
to
the
young
woman
truly
she
cried
it
is
impossible
what
has
he
found
asked
charles
sire
i
dare
not
repeat
it
sire
said
henry
in
the
name
marie
touchet
there
is
letter
for
letter
by
changing
the
into
a
as
is
often
done
charme
i
charm
all
yes
exclaimed
charles
letter
for
letter
i
want
this
to
be
your
motto
marie
do
you
hear
never
was
one
better
deserved
thanks
henriot
marie
i
will
give
it
to
you
written
in
diamonds
the
supper
over
two
struck
from
now
said
charles
in
return
for
this
compliment
marie
you
will
give
the
king
an
armchair
in
which
he
can
sleep
until
daybreak
but
let
it
be
some
distance
from
us
because
he
snores
frightfully
then
if
you
waken
before
i
do
you
will
rouse
me
for
at
six
we
have
to
be
at
the
bastille
henriot
make
yourself
as
comfortable
as
possible
but
he
added
approaching
the
king
of
navarre
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
for
your
life
henry
do
you
hear
for
your
life
do
not
leave
here
without
me
especially
to
return
to
the
louvre
henry
had
suspected
too
many
things
in
what
still
remained
unexplained
to
him
to
disobey
such
advice
charles
ix
entered
his
room
and
henry
the
sturdy
mountaineer
settled
himself
in
an
armchair
in
which
he
soon
justified
the
precaution
taken
by
his
in
keeping
at
a
distance
at
dawn
he
was
awakened
by
charles
as
he
had
not
undressed
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
finish
his
toilet
the
king
was
more
happy
and
smiling
than
he
ever
was
at
the
louvre
the
hours
spent
by
him
in
that
little
house
in
the
rue
des
barres
were
his
hours
of
sunshine
both
men
went
out
through
the
the
young
woman
was
still
in
bed
the
child
was
asleep
in
its
cradle
both
were
smiling
charles
looked
at
them
for
a
moment
with
infinite
tenderness
then
turning
to
the
king
of
navarre
henriot
said
he
if
you
ever
hear
what
i
did
for
you
last
night
or
if
misfortune
come
to
me
remember
this
child
asleep
in
its
cradle
then
kissing
both
mother
and
child
on
the
forehead
without
giving
henry
time
to
question
him
my
angels
said
he
and
went
out
henry
followed
deep
in
thought
the
horses
were
waiting
for
them
at
the
bastille
held
by
the
gentlemen
to
whom
charles
ix
had
given
the
order
charles
signed
to
henry
to
mount
sprang
into
his
own
saddle
and
riding
through
the
garden
of
the
arbalite
followed
the
outside
highways
where
are
we
going
asked
henry
we
are
going
to
see
if
the
duc
returned
for
madame
de
condé
alone
replied
charles
and
if
there
is
as
much
ambition
as
love
in
his
heart
which
i
greatly
doubt
henry
did
not
understand
the
answer
but
followed
charles
in
silence
they
reached
the
marais
and
as
from
the
shadow
of
the
palisades
they
could
see
all
which
at
that
time
was
called
the
faubourg
saint
laurent
charles
pointed
out
to
henry
through
the
grayish
mist
of
the
morning
some
men
wrapped
in
great
cloaks
and
wearing
fur
caps
they
were
on
horseback
and
rode
ahead
of
a
wagon
which
was
heavily
laden
as
they
drew
near
they
became
outlined
more
clearly
and
one
could
see
another
man
in
a
long
brown
cloak
his
face
hidden
by
a
french
hat
riding
and
talking
with
them
ah
ah
said
charles
smiling
i
thought
so
well
sire
said
henry
if
i
am
not
mistaken
that
rider
in
the
brown
cloak
is
the
duc
yes
said
charles
ix
turn
out
a
little
henriot
i
do
not
want
him
to
see
us
but
asked
henry
who
are
the
men
in
gray
cloaks
with
fur
caps
those
men
said
charles
are
polish
ambassadors
and
in
that
wagon
is
a
crown
and
now
said
he
urging
his
horse
to
a
gallop
and
turning
into
the
road
of
the
porte
du
temple
come
henriot
i
have
seen
all
that
i
wanted
to
see
chapter
xxxvii
the
return
to
the
louvre
when
catharine
thought
that
everything
was
over
in
the
king
of
rooms
when
the
dead
guards
had
been
removed
when
maurevel
had
been
carried
to
her
apartments
and
the
carpet
had
been
cleaned
she
dismissed
her
women
for
it
was
almost
midnight
and
strove
to
sleep
but
the
shock
had
been
too
violent
and
the
disappointment
too
keen
that
detested
henry
constantly
escaping
her
snares
which
were
usually
fatal
seemed
protected
by
some
invincible
power
which
catharine
persisted
in
calling
chance
although
in
her
heart
of
hearts
a
voice
told
her
that
its
true
name
was
destiny
the
thought
that
the
report
of
the
new
attempt
in
spreading
throughout
the
louvre
and
beyond
the
louvre
would
give
a
greater
confidence
than
ever
in
the
future
to
henry
and
the
huguenots
exasperated
her
and
at
that
moment
had
chance
against
which
she
was
so
unfortunately
struggling
delivered
her
enemy
into
her
hands
surely
with
the
little
florentine
dagger
she
wore
at
her
belt
she
could
have
thwarted
that
destiny
so
favorable
to
the
king
of
navarre
the
hours
of
the
night
hours
so
long
for
one
waiting
and
watching
struck
one
after
another
without
catharine
being
able
to
close
her
eyes
a
whole
world
of
new
plans
unrolled
in
her
visionary
mind
during
those
nocturnal
hours
finally
at
daybreak
she
rose
dressed
herself
and
went
to
the
apartments
of
charles
ix
the
guards
who
were
accustomed
to
see
her
go
to
the
king
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
let
her
pass
she
crossed
the
antechamber
therefore
and
reached
the
armory
but
there
she
found
the
nurse
of
charles
who
was
awake
my
son
said
the
queen
madame
he
gave
orders
that
no
one
was
to
be
admitted
to
his
room
before
eight
this
order
was
not
for
me
nurse
it
was
for
every
one
madame
catharine
smiled
yes
i
know
very
well
said
the
nurse
that
no
one
has
any
right
to
oppose
your
majesty
i
therefore
beg
you
to
listen
to
the
prayer
of
a
poor
woman
and
to
refrain
from
entering
nurse
i
must
speak
to
my
son
madame
i
will
not
open
the
door
except
on
a
formal
order
from
your
majesty
open
nurse
said
catharine
i
order
you
to
open
at
this
voice
more
respected
and
much
more
feared
in
the
louvre
than
that
of
charles
himself
the
nurse
handed
the
key
to
catharine
but
the
queen
had
no
need
of
it
she
drew
from
her
pocket
her
own
key
of
the
room
and
under
its
heavy
pressure
the
door
yielded
the
room
was
vacant
charles
bed
was
untouched
and
his
greyhound
actéon
asleep
on
the
that
covered
the
step
of
the
bed
rose
and
came
forward
to
lick
the
ivory
hands
of
catharine
ah
said
the
queen
frowning
he
is
out
i
will
wait
for
him
she
seated
herself
pensive
and
gloomy
at
the
window
which
overlooked
the
court
of
the
louvre
and
from
which
the
chief
entrance
was
visible
for
two
hours
she
sat
there
as
motionless
and
pale
as
a
marble
statue
when
at
length
she
perceived
a
troop
of
horsemen
returning
to
the
louvre
at
whose
head
she
recognized
charles
and
henry
of
navarre
then
she
understood
all
instead
of
arguing
with
her
in
regard
to
the
arrest
of
his
charles
had
taken
him
away
and
so
had
saved
him
blind
blind
blind
she
murmured
then
she
waited
an
instant
later
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
adjoining
room
which
was
the
armory
but
sire
henry
was
saying
now
that
we
have
returned
to
the
louvre
tell
me
why
you
took
me
away
and
what
is
the
service
you
have
rendered
me
no
no
henriot
replied
charles
laughing
some
day
perhaps
you
will
find
out
but
for
the
present
it
must
remain
a
mystery
know
only
that
for
the
time
being
you
have
in
all
probability
brought
about
a
fierce
quarrel
between
my
mother
and
me
as
he
uttered
these
words
charles
raised
the
curtain
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
catharine
behind
him
and
above
his
shoulder
rose
the
pale
anxious
countenance
of
the
béarnais
ah
you
here
madame
said
charles
frowning
yes
my
son
said
catharine
i
want
to
speak
to
you
to
me
to
you
alone
well
well
said
charles
turning
to
his
since
there
is
no
escape
the
sooner
the
better
i
will
leave
you
sire
said
henry
yes
yes
leave
us
replied
charles
and
as
you
are
a
catholic
henriot
go
and
hear
a
mass
for
me
while
i
stay
for
the
sermon
henry
bowed
and
withdrew
charles
ix
went
directly
to
the
point
well
madame
said
he
trying
to
make
a
joke
of
the
affair
by
heaven
you
are
waiting
to
scold
me
are
you
not
i
wickedly
upset
your
little
plan
well
the
devil
i
could
not
let
the
man
who
had
just
saved
my
life
be
arrested
and
taken
to
the
bastille
nor
did
i
want
to
quarrel
with
my
mother
i
am
a
good
son
moreover
he
added
in
a
low
tone
the
lord
punishes
children
who
quarrel
with
their
mothers
witness
my
brother
françois
ii
forgive
me
therefore
frankly
and
confess
that
the
joke
was
a
good
one
sire
said
catharine
your
majesty
is
mistaken
it
is
not
a
joke
yes
yes
and
you
will
end
by
looking
at
it
in
that
way
or
the
devil
take
me
sire
by
your
blunder
you
have
baffled
a
project
which
would
have
led
to
an
important
discovery
bah
a
project
are
you
embarrassed
because
of
a
baffled
project
mother
you
can
make
twenty
others
and
in
those
well
i
promise
i
will
second
you
now
that
you
will
second
me
it
is
too
late
for
he
is
warned
and
will
be
on
his
guard
well
said
the
king
let
us
come
to
the
point
what
have
you
against
henriot
the
fact
that
he
conspires
yes
i
know
that
this
is
your
constant
accusation
but
does
not
every
one
conspire
more
or
less
in
this
charming
royal
household
called
the
louvre
but
he
conspires
more
than
any
one
and
he
is
much
more
dangerous
than
one
imagines
a
regular
lorenzino
said
charles
listen
said
catharine
becoming
gloomy
at
mention
of
this
name
which
reminded
her
of
one
of
the
bloodiest
catastrophes
in
the
history
of
florence
listen
there
is
a
way
of
proving
to
me
that
i
am
wrong
what
way
mother
ask
henry
who
was
in
his
room
last
night
in
his
room
last
night
yes
and
if
he
tells
you
well
well
i
shall
be
ready
to
admit
that
i
have
been
mistaken
but
in
case
it
was
a
woman
we
can
not
ask
a
woman
yes
a
woman
who
killed
two
of
your
guards
and
perhaps
mortally
wounded
monsieur
de
maurevel
oh
oh
said
the
king
this
is
serious
was
there
any
bloodshed
three
men
were
stretched
on
the
floor
and
the
one
who
reduced
them
to
this
state
escaped
safe
and
sound
by
gog
and
magog
exclaimed
charles
he
was
a
brave
fellow
and
you
are
right
mother
i
must
know
him
well
i
tell
you
in
advance
that
you
will
not
know
him
at
least
not
through
henry
but
through
you
mother
the
man
did
not
escape
without
leaving
some
trace
without
your
noticing
some
part
of
his
clothing
nothing
was
noticed
except
the
very
elegant
red
cloak
which
he
wore
ah
ah
a
red
cloak
cried
charles
i
know
only
one
at
court
remarkable
enough
to
attract
attention
exactly
said
catharine
well
demanded
charles
well
said
catharine
wait
for
me
in
your
rooms
my
son
and
i
will
go
and
see
if
my
orders
have
been
carried
out
catharine
left
and
charles
alone
began
walking
up
and
down
distractedly
whistling
a
one
hand
in
his
doublet
the
other
hanging
down
which
his
dog
licked
every
time
he
paused
as
to
henry
he
had
left
his
greatly
disturbed
and
instead
of
going
along
the
main
corridor
he
had
taken
the
small
private
stairway
to
which
we
have
already
referred
more
than
once
and
which
led
to
the
second
story
scarcely
had
he
ascended
four
steps
before
he
perceived
a
figure
at
the
first
landing
he
stopped
raising
his
hand
to
his
dagger
but
he
soon
saw
it
was
a
woman
who
took
hold
of
his
hand
and
said
in
a
charming
voice
which
he
well
knew
thank
god
sire
you
are
safe
and
sound
i
was
so
afraid
for
you
but
no
doubt
god
heard
my
prayer
what
has
happened
said
henry
you
will
know
when
you
reach
your
rooms
you
need
not
worry
over
orthon
i
have
seen
to
him
the
young
woman
descended
the
stairs
hastily
making
henry
believe
that
she
had
met
him
by
chance
that
is
strange
said
henry
to
himself
what
is
the
matter
what
has
happened
to
orthon
unfortunately
the
question
was
not
heard
by
madame
de
sauve
for
the
latter
had
already
disappeared
suddenly
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
henry
perceived
another
figure
but
this
time
it
was
that
of
a
man
hush
said
the
man
ah
is
it
you
françois
do
not
call
me
by
my
name
what
has
happened
return
to
your
rooms
and
you
will
see
then
slip
into
the
corridor
look
carefully
around
to
make
sure
that
no
one
is
spying
on
you
and
come
to
my
apartments
the
door
will
be
ajar
he
too
disappeared
down
the
stairs
like
the
phantoms
in
a
theatre
who
glide
through
a
trap
door
saint
gris
murmured
the
béarnais
the
puzzle
continues
but
since
the
answer
is
in
my
rooms
let
us
go
thither
and
find
it
however
it
was
not
without
emotion
that
henry
went
on
his
way
he
had
the
sensitiveness
and
the
superstition
of
youth
everything
was
clearly
reflected
on
his
mind
the
surface
of
which
was
as
smooth
as
a
mirror
and
what
he
had
just
heard
foretold
trouble
he
reached
the
door
of
his
rooms
and
listened
not
a
sound
besides
since
charlotte
had
said
to
return
to
his
apartments
it
was
evident
that
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
fear
by
doing
so
he
glanced
hurriedly
around
the
first
room
it
was
vacant
nothing
showed
that
anything
had
occurred
orthon
is
not
here
said
he
he
passed
on
to
the
next
room
there
everything
was
explained
in
spite
of
the
water
which
had
been
thrown
on
in
bucketsful
great
red
spots
covered
the
floor
a
piece
of
furniture
was
broken
the
bed
curtains
had
been
slashed
by
the
sword
a
venetian
mirror
had
been
shattered
by
a
bullet
and
a
bloody
hand
which
had
left
its
terrible
imprint
on
the
wall
showed
that
this
silent
chamber
had
been
the
scene
of
a
frightful
struggle
henry
embraced
all
these
details
at
a
glance
and
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
now
damp
with
perspiration
murmured
ah
i
know
now
the
service
the
king
has
rendered
me
they
came
here
to
assassinate
me
and
ah
de
mouy
what
have
they
done
to
de
mouy
the
wretches
they
may
have
killed
him
and
as
anxious
to
learn
the
news
as
the
duc
was
to
tell
it
henry
threw
a
last
mournful
glance
on
the
surrounding
objects
hurried
from
the
room
reached
the
corridor
made
sure
that
it
was
vacant
and
pushing
open
the
door
which
he
carefully
shut
behind
him
he
hurried
to
the
duc
the
duke
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
first
room
laying
his
finger
on
his
lips
he
hastily
took
henry
hand
and
drew
him
into
a
small
round
tower
which
was
completely
isolated
and
which
consequently
was
out
of
range
of
spies
ah
brother
said
he
what
a
horrible
night
what
happened
asked
henry
they
tried
to
arrest
you
me
yes
you
for
what
reason
i
do
not
know
where
were
you
the
king
took
me
into
the
city
with
him
last
night
then
he
knew
about
it
said
but
since
you
were
not
in
your
rooms
who
was
was
some
one
there
asked
henry
as
if
he
were
ignorant
of
the
fact
yes
a
man
when
i
had
heard
the
noise
i
ran
to
help
you
but
it
was
too
late
was
the
man
arrested
asked
henry
anxiously
no
he
escaped
after
he
had
wounded
maurevel
dangerously
and
killed
two
guards
ah
brave
de
mouy
cried
henry
it
was
de
mouy
then
said
quickly
henry
saw
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
i
presume
so
said
he
for
i
had
an
appointment
with
him
to
discuss
your
escape
and
to
tell
him
that
i
had
yielded
all
my
rights
to
the
throne
of
navarre
to
you
if
that
is
known
said
growing
pale
we
are
lost
yes
for
maurevel
will
speak
maurevel
received
a
in
his
throat
and
i
found
out
from
the
surgeon
who
dressed
the
wound
that
it
would
be
a
week
before
he
would
utter
a
single
word
a
week
that
is
more
than
enough
for
de
mouy
to
escape
for
that
matter
said
it
might
have
been
some
one
besides
monsieur
de
mouy
you
think
so
said
henry
yes
the
man
disappeared
very
quickly
and
nothing
but
his
red
cloak
was
seen
and
a
red
cloak
said
henry
is
more
apt
to
be
worn
by
a
courtier
than
by
a
soldier
i
should
never
suspect
de
mouy
in
a
red
cloak
no
if
any
one
were
suspected
said
it
would
be
more
apt
to
be
he
stopped
it
would
be
more
likely
to
be
monsieur
de
la
mole
said
henry
certainly
since
i
myself
who
saw
the
man
running
away
thought
so
for
an
instant
you
thought
so
why
it
must
have
been
monsieur
de
la
mole
then
does
he
know
anything
asked
absolutely
nothing
at
least
nothing
of
importance
brother
said
the
duke
i
really
think
now
that
it
was
he
the
devil
said
henry
if
it
was
that
will
trouble
the
queen
greatly
for
she
is
interested
in
him
interested
you
say
said
in
amazement
yes
do
you
not
remember
françois
that
it
was
your
sister
who
recommended
him
to
you
yes
said
the
duke
in
a
dull
voice
so
i
tried
to
be
agreeable
to
him
the
proof
of
this
is
that
fearing
his
red
cloak
might
compromise
him
i
went
up
to
his
rooms
and
took
the
cloak
away
oh
oh
exclaimed
henry
that
was
doubly
prudent
and
now
i
would
not
bet
but
i
would
swear
that
it
was
he
even
in
court
asked
françois
faith
yes
replied
henry
he
probably
came
to
bring
me
some
message
from
marguerite
if
i
were
sure
of
being
upheld
by
your
testimony
said
i
would
almost
accuse
him
if
you
were
to
accuse
him
replied
henry
you
understand
brother
that
i
would
not
contradict
you
but
the
queen
said
ah
yes
the
queen
we
must
know
what
she
would
do
i
will
undertake
to
find
out
plague
it
brother
she
will
do
wrong
to
lie
to
us
for
this
affair
will
make
a
glorious
reputation
of
bravery
for
the
young
man
and
which
can
not
have
cost
him
dear
either
for
he
probably
bought
it
on
credit
furthermore
it
is
true
that
he
is
well
able
to
pay
back
both
interest
and
capital
well
what
can
you
expect
said
henry
in
this
base
world
one
has
nothing
for
nothing
and
bowing
and
smiling
to
he
cautiously
thrust
his
head
into
the
corridor
and
making
sure
that
no
one
had
been
listening
he
hurried
rapidly
away
and
disappeared
down
the
private
stairway
which
led
to
the
apartments
of
marguerite
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
the
queen
of
navarre
was
no
less
anxious
than
her
husband
the
night
expedition
sent
against
her
and
the
duchesse
de
nevers
by
the
king
the
duc
the
duc
de
guise
and
henry
whom
she
had
recognized
troubled
her
greatly
in
all
probability
there
was
nothing
which
could
compromise
her
the
janitor
unfastened
from
the
gate
by
la
mole
and
coconnas
had
promised
to
be
silent
but
four
lords
like
those
with
whom
two
simple
gentlemen
such
as
la
mole
and
coconnas
had
coped
would
not
have
gone
out
of
their
way
by
chance
or
without
having
had
some
reason
for
thus
inconveniencing
themselves
marguerite
had
returned
at
daybreak
having
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
with
the
duchesse
de
nevers
she
had
retired
at
once
but
had
been
unable
to
sleep
and
had
started
at
the
slightest
sound
in
the
midst
of
this
anxiety
she
heard
some
one
knocking
at
the
secret
door
and
being
informed
that
the
visitor
was
gillonne
she
gave
orders
to
have
her
admitted
henry
waited
at
the
outer
door
nothing
in
his
appearance
showed
the
wounded
husband
his
usual
smile
lay
on
his
delicate
lips
and
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
betrayed
the
terrible
anxiety
through
which
he
had
just
passed
he
seemed
to
glance
inquiringly
at
marguerite
to
discover
if
she
would
allow
him
to
talk
with
her
alone
marguerite
understood
her
husband
look
and
signed
to
gillonne
to
withdraw
madame
said
henry
i
know
how
deeply
you
are
attached
to
your
friends
and
i
fear
i
bring
you
bad
news
what
is
it
monsieur
asked
marguerite
one
of
your
dearest
servants
is
at
present
greatly
compromised
which
one
the
dear
count
de
la
mole
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
mole
compromised
and
why
because
of
the
affair
of
last
night
in
spite
of
her
marguerite
could
not
keep
from
blushing
but
she
made
an
effort
over
herself
what
affair
she
asked
what
said
henry
did
you
not
hear
all
the
noise
which
was
made
in
the
louvre
no
monsieur
i
congratulate
you
madame
said
henry
with
charming
simplicity
this
proves
that
you
are
a
sound
sleeper
but
what
happened
it
seems
that
our
good
mother
gave
an
order
to
monsieur
de
maurevel
and
six
of
his
men
to
arrest
me
you
monsieur
you
yes
me
for
what
reason
ah
who
can
tell
the
reasons
of
a
mind
as
subtle
as
that
of
your
mother
i
suspect
the
reasons
but
i
do
not
know
them
positively
and
you
were
not
in
your
rooms
no
i
happened
not
to
be
you
have
guessed
rightly
madame
i
was
not
last
evening
the
king
asked
me
to
go
out
with
him
but
although
i
was
not
in
my
rooms
some
one
else
was
who
it
seems
that
it
was
the
count
de
la
mole
the
count
de
la
mole
exclaimed
marguerite
astonished
by
heavens
what
a
lively
little
fellow
this
man
from
the
provinces
is
continued
henry
do
you
know
that
he
wounded
maurevel
and
killed
two
guards
wounded
monsieur
de
maurevel
and
killed
two
guards
impossible
what
you
doubt
his
courage
madame
no
but
i
say
that
monsieur
de
la
mole
could
not
have
been
in
your
rooms
why
not
why
because
because
said
marguerite
embarrassed
because
he
was
elsewhere
ah
if
he
can
prove
an
alibi
said
henry
that
is
different
he
will
tell
where
he
was
and
the
matter
will
be
settled
where
was
he
said
marguerite
quickly
in
all
probability
the
day
will
not
pass
without
his
being
arrested
and
questioned
but
unfortunately
as
there
are
proofs
proofs
what
proofs
the
man
who
made
this
desperate
defence
wore
a
red
cloak
but
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
a
red
cloak
i
know
another
man
who
has
one
no
doubt
and
i
too
know
one
but
this
is
what
will
happen
if
it
was
not
monsieur
de
la
mole
who
was
in
my
rooms
it
must
have
been
the
other
man
who
wears
a
red
cloak
like
la
mole
now
do
you
know
who
this
other
man
is
heavens
there
lies
the
danger
you
as
well
as
myself
madame
have
seen
it
your
emotion
proves
this
let
us
now
talk
like
two
people
who
are
discussing
the
most
desirable
thing
in
the
world
a
throne
a
most
precious
gift
life
de
mouy
arrested
we
are
ruined
yes
i
understand
that
while
monsieur
de
la
mole
compromises
no
one
at
least
you
would
not
suppose
him
capable
of
inventing
a
story
such
as
for
instance
that
he
was
with
some
ladies
whom
i
know
monsieur
said
marguerite
if
you
fear
only
that
you
may
be
easy
he
will
not
say
it
what
said
henry
would
he
remain
silent
if
death
were
to
be
the
price
of
his
silence
he
would
remain
silent
monsieur
you
are
sure
of
this
i
am
sure
then
everything
is
for
the
best
said
henry
rising
you
are
going
monsieur
asked
marguerite
quickly
oh
my
god
yes
this
is
all
i
had
to
say
to
you
and
you
are
going
to
try
and
get
out
of
the
trouble
we
have
been
put
to
by
this
devil
of
a
man
in
the
red
cloak
oh
my
god
my
god
the
poor
young
man
cried
marguerite
pitifully
wringing
her
hands
really
said
henry
as
he
went
out
this
dear
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
a
faithful
servant
chapter
xxxviii
the

of
the
queen
mother
charles
entered
his
room
smiling
and
joking
but
after
a
conversation
of
ten
minutes
with
his
mother
one
would
have
said
that
the
latter
had
given
him
her
pallor
and
anger
in
exchange
for
the
of
her
son
monsieur
de
la
mole
said
charles
monsieur
de
la
mole
henry
and
the
duc
must
be
sent
for
henry
because
this
young
man
was
a
huguenot
the
duc
because
he
is
in
his
service
send
for
them
if
you
wish
my
son
but
you
will
learn
nothing
henry
and
françois
i
fear
are
much
more
closely
bound
together
than
one
would
suppose
from
appearances
to
question
them
is
to
suspect
them
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
wait
for
the
slow
but
sure
proof
of
time
if
you
give
the
guilty
ones
time
to
breathe
again
my
son
if
you
let
them
think
they
have
escaped
your
vigilance
they
will
become
bold
and
triumphant
and
will
give
you
a
better
opportunity
to
punish
them
then
we
shall
know
everything
charles
walked
up
and
down
undecided
gnawing
his
anger
as
a
horse
gnaws
his
bit
and
pressing
his
clinched
hand
to
his
heart
which
was
consumed
by
his
one
idea
no
no
said
he
at
length
i
will
not
wait
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
wait
beset
with
suspicions
as
i
am
besides
every
day
these
courtiers
become
more
insolent
even
last
night
did
not
two
of
them
dare
to
cope
with
us
if
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
innocent
very
good
but
i
should
not
be
sorry
to
know
where
monsieur
de
la
mole
was
last
night
while
they
were
attacking
my
guards
in
the
louvre
and
me
in
the
rue
cloche
percée
so
let
the
duc
be
sent
for
and
afterwards
henry
i
will
question
them
separately
you
may
remain
mother
catharine
sat
down
for
a
determined
spirit
such
as
hers
was
every
incident
turned
by
her
powerful
hand
would
lead
her
to
her
goal
although
it
might
seem
to
be
leading
away
from
it
from
every
blow
there
would
result
noise
and
a
spark
the
noise
would
guide
the
spark
give
light
the
duc
entered
his
previous
conversation
with
henry
had
prepared
him
for
this
interview
therefore
he
was
quite
calm
his
replies
were
very
exact
warned
by
his
mother
to
remain
in
his
own
rooms
he
was
completely
ignorant
of
the
events
of
the
night
but
as
his
apartments
opened
upon
the
same
corridor
as
did
those
of
the
king
of
navarre
he
had
at
first
thought
he
heard
a
sound
like
that
of
a
door
being
broken
in
then
curses
then
thereupon
he
had
ventured
to
push
his
door
partly
open
and
had
seen
a
man
in
a
red
cloak
running
away
charles
and
his
mother
exchanged
glances
in
a
red
cloak
said
the
king
in
a
red
cloak
replied
and
did
you
have
any
suspicions
regarding
this
red
cloak
rallied
all
his
strength
that
he
might
lie
as
naturally
as
possible
at
first
sight
said
he
i
must
confess
to
your
majesty
that
i
thought
i
recognized
the
red
cloak
of
one
of
my
gentlemen
what
is
the
name
of
this
gentleman
monsieur
de
la
mole
why
was
not
monsieur
de
la
mole
with
you
as
his
duty
required
him
to
be
i
had
given
him
leave
of
absence
said
the
duke
that
is
well
now
you
may
go
said
charles
the
duc
started
towards
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
not
that
way
said
charles
this
way
and
he
indicated
the
door
opening
into
his
nurse
room
charles
did
not
want
françois
and
henry
to
meet
he
did
not
know
that
they
had
already
seen
each
other
for
an
instant
and
that
this
instant
had
sufficed
for
the
two
to
agree
on
their
plans
at
a
sign
from
charles
henry
entered
he
did
not
wait
for
charles
to
question
him
however
sire
said
he
your
majesty
has
done
well
to
send
for
me
for
i
was
just
coming
to
demand
justice
of
you
charles
frowned
yes
justice
said
henry
i
will
begin
by
thanking
your
majesty
for
having
taken
me
with
you
last
night
for
by
doing
this
i
now
know
that
you
saved
my
life
but
what
had
i
done
that
an
attempt
should
be
made
to
assassinate
me
not
to
assassinate
said
catharine
quickly
but
to
arrest
you
well
said
henry
even
so
what
crime
have
i
committed
to
merit
arrest
if
i
am
guilty
i
am
as
much
so
this
morning
as
i
was
last
evening
tell
me
my
offence
sire
embarrassed
as
to
what
reply
to
make
charles
looked
at
his
mother
my
son
said
catharine
you
receive
suspicious
characters
very
good
said
henry
and
these
suspicious
characters
compromise
me
is
that
it
madame
yes
henry
give
me
their
names
give
me
their
names
who
are
they
let
me
see
them
really
said
charles
henriot
has
the
right
to
demand
an
explanation
and
i
do
demand
it
said
henry
realizing
the
superiority
of
his
position
and
anxious
to
make
the
most
of
it
i
ask
it
from
my
good
brother
charles
and
from
my
good
mother
catharine
since
my
marriage
with
marguerite
have
i
not
been
a
kind
husband
ask
marguerite
a
good
catholic
ask
my
confessor
a
good
relative
ask
those
who
were
at
the
hunt
yesterday
yes
that
is
true
henriot
said
the
king
but
what
can
you
do
they
claim
that
you
conspire
against
whom
against
me
sire
if
i
had
been
conspiring
against
you
i
had
merely
to
let
events
take
their
course
when
your
horse
broke
his
knee
and
could
not
rise
or
when
the
furious
boar
turned
on
your
majesty
well
the
devil
mother
do
you
know
that
he
is
right
but
who
was
in
your
rooms
last
night
madame
said
henry
in
times
when
so
few
dare
to
answer
for
themselves
i
should
never
attempt
to
answer
for
others
i
left
my
rooms
at
seven
in
the
evening
at
ten
my
brother
charles
took
me
away
and
i
spent
the
night
with
him
i
could
not
be
with
your
majesty
and
know
what
was
going
on
in
my
rooms
at
the
same
time
but
said
catharine
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
one
of
your
men
killed
two
of
his
majesty
guards
and
wounded
monsieur
de
maurevel
one
of
my
men
said
henry
what
man
madame
name
him
every
one
accuses
monsieur
de
la
mole
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
not
in
my
suite
madame
monsieur
de
la
mole
belongs
to
monsieur
to
whom
he
was
recommended
by
your
daughter
but
said
charles
was
it
monsieur
de
la
mole
who
was
in
your
rooms
henriot
how
can
you
expect
me
to
know
sire
i
can
say
neither
yes
nor
no
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
an
exceptional
servant
thoroughly
devoted
to
the
queen
of
navarre
he
often
brings
me
messages
either
from
marguerite
to
whom
he
is
grateful
for
having
recommended
him
to
monsieur
le
duc
or
from
monsieur
le
duc
himself
i
can
not
say
that
it
was
not
monsieur
de
la
mole
it
was
he
said
catharine
his
red
cloak
was
recognized
has
monsieur
de
la
mole
a
red
cloak
then
yes
and
the
man
who
so
cleverly
disposed
of
two
of
my
guards
and
monsieur
de
maurevel
had
a
red
cloak
asked
henry
exactly
said
charles
i
have
nothing
to
say
said
the
béarnais
but
in
any
case
it
seems
to
me
that
instead
of
summoning
me
here
since
i
was
not
in
my
rooms
it
is
monsieur
de
la
mole
who
having
been
there
as
you
say
should
be
questioned
but
said
henry
i
must
observe
one
thing
to
your
majesty
what
is
that
this
that
if
i
had
seen
an
order
signed
by
my
king
and
had
defended
myself
instead
of
obeying
this
order
i
should
be
guilty
and
should
deserve
all
sorts
of
punishment
but
it
was
not
i
but
some
stranger
whom
this
order
in
no
way
concerned
there
was
an
attempt
made
to
arrest
him
unjustly
he
defended
himself
too
well
perhaps
but
he
was
in
the
right
and
yet
murmured
catharine
madame
said
henry
was
the
order
to
arrest
me
yes
said
catharine
and
his
majesty
himself
signed
it
was
it
an
order
to
arrest
any
one
found
in
my
place
in
case
i
was
not
there
no
said
catharine
well
said
henry
unless
you
prove
that
i
was
conspiring
and
that
the
man
who
was
in
my
rooms
was
conspiring
with
me
this
man
is
innocent
then
turning
to
charles
ix
sire
continued
henry
i
shall
not
leave
the
louvre
at
a
simple
word
from
your
majesty
i
shall
even
be
ready
to
enter
any
state
prison
you
may
be
pleased
to
suggest
but
while
waiting
for
the
proof
to
the
contrary
i
have
the
right
to
call
myself
and
i
do
call
myself
the
very
faithful
servant
subject
and
brother
of
your
majesty
and
with
a
dignity
hitherto
unknown
in
him
henry
bowed
to
charles
and
withdrew
bravo
henriot
said
charles
when
the
king
of
navarre
had
left
bravo
because
he
has
defeated
us
said
catharine
why
should
i
not
applaud
when
we
fence
together
and
he
touches
me
do
i
not
say
mother
you
are
wrong
to
hate
this
boy
as
you
do
my
son
said
catharine
pressing
the
hand
of
charles
i
do
not
hate
him
i
fear
him
well
you
are
wrong
mother
henriot
is
my
friend
and
as
he
said
had
he
been
conspiring
against
me
he
had
only
to
let
the
wild
boar
alone
yes
said
catharine
so
that
monsieur
le
duc
his
personal
enemy
might
be
king
of
france
mother
whatever
henriot
motive
in
saving
my
life
the
fact
is
that
he
saved
it
and
the
devil
i
do
not
want
any
harm
to
come
to
him
as
to
monsieur
de
la
mole
well
i
will
talk
about
him
with
my
brother
to
whom
he
belongs
this
was
charles
ix
way
of
dismissing
his
mother
who
withdrew
endeavoring
to
fix
her
suspicions
on
account
of
his
unimportance
monsieur
de
la
mole
did
not
answer
to
her
needs
returning
to
her
rooms
catharine
found
marguerite
waiting
for
her
ah
ah
said
she
is
it
you
my
daughter
i
sent
for
you
last
evening
i
know
it
madame
but
i
had
gone
out
and
this
morning
this
morning
madame
i
have
come
to
tell
your
majesty
that
you
are
about
to
do
a
great
wrong
what
is
that
you
are
going
to
have
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
mole
arrested
you
are
mistaken
my
daughter
i
am
going
to
have
no
one
arrested
it
is
the
king
not
i
who
gives
orders
for
arrests
let
us
not
quibble
over
the
words
madame
when
the
circumstances
are
serious
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
going
to
be
arrested
is
he
not
very
likely
accused
of
having
been
found
in
the
chamber
of
the
king
of
navarre
last
night
and
of
having
killed
two
guards
and
wounded
monsieur
de
maurevel
such
indeed
is
the
crime
they
impute
to
him
they
impute
it
to
him
wrongly
madame
said
marguerite
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
not
guilty
monsieur
de
la
mole
not
guilty
said
catharine
giving
a
start
of
joy
and
thinking
that
what
marguerite
was
about
to
tell
her
would
throw
light
on
the
subject
no
went
on
marguerite
he
is
not
guilty
he
can
not
be
so
for
he
was
not
in
the
king
room
where
was
he
then
in
my
room
madame
in
your
room
yes
in
my
room
at
this
avowal
from
a
daughter
of
france
catharine
felt
like
hurling
a
withering
glance
at
marguerite
but
she
merely
crossed
her
arms
on
her
lap
and
said
she
after
a
moment
silence
if
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
arrested
and
questioned
he
will
say
where
he
was
and
with
whom
he
was
mother
replied
marguerite
although
she
felt
sure
of
the
contrary
since
this
is
so
you
are
right
my
daughter
monsieur
de
la
mole
must
not
be
arrested
marguerite
shivered
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
something
strange
and
terrible
in
the
way
her
mother
uttered
these
words
but
she
had
nothing
to
say
for
what
she
had
come
to
ask
for
had
been
granted
her
but
said
catharine
if
it
was
not
monsieur
de
la
mole
who
was
in
the
king
room
it
was
some
one
else
marguerite
was
silent
do
you
know
who
it
was
my
daughter
said
catharine
no
mother
said
marguerite
in
an
unsteady
voice
come
do
not
be
half
confidential
i
repeat
madame
that
i
do
not
know
replied
marguerite
again
growing
pale
in
spite
of
herself
well
well
said
catharine
carelessly
we
shall
find
out
go
now
my
daughter
you
may
rest
assured
that
your
mother
will
watch
over
your
honor
marguerite
went
out
ah
murmured
catharine
they
are
in
league
henry
and
marguerite
are
working
together
while
the
wife
is
silent
the
husband
is
blind
ah
you
are
very
clever
my
children
and
you
think
yourselves
very
strong
but
your
strength
is
in
your
union
and
i
will
break
you
one
after
the
other
besides
the
day
will
come
when
maurevel
can
speak
or
write
utter
a
name
or
spell
six
letters
and
then
we
shall
know
everything
yes
but
in
the
meantime
the
guilty
shall
be
in
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
separate
them
at
once
thereupon
catharine
set
out
for
the
apartments
of
her
son
whom
she
found
holding
a
conference
with
ah
ah
exclaimed
charles
frowning
is
it
you
mother
why
did
you
not
say
the
word
was
in
your
mind
charles
what
is
in
my
mind
belongs
to
me
madame
said
the
king
in
the
rough
tone
he
sometimes
used
even
when
speaking
to
catharine
what
do
you
want
of
me
tell
me
quickly
well
you
were
right
my
son
said
catharine
to
charles
and
you
were
wrong
in
what
respect
madame
asked
both
princes
it
was
not
monsieur
de
la
mole
who
was
in
the
apartments
of
the
king
of
navarre
ah
ah
cried
françois
growing
pale
who
was
it
then
asked
charles
we
do
not
know
yet
but
we
shall
know
when
maurevel
is
able
to
speak
so
let
us
drop
the
subject
which
will
soon
be
explained
and
return
to
monsieur
de
la
mole
well
what
do
you
want
of
monsieur
de
la
mole
mother
since
he
was
not
in
the
rooms
of
the
king
of
navarre
no
said
catharine
he
was
not
there
but
he
was
with
the
queen
with
the
queen
cried
charles
bursting
into
a
nervous
laugh
with
the
queen
murmured
turning
as
pale
as
death
no
no
said
charles
de
guise
told
me
he
had
met
litter
yes
said
catharine
she
has
a
house
in
town
in
the
rue
cloche
percée
cried
the
king
oh
oh
this
is
too
much
said
driving
his
nails
into
his
breast
and
to
have
had
him
recommended
to
me
ah
now
that
i
think
of
it
said
the
king
stopping
suddenly
it
was
he
who
defended
himself
against
us
last
night
and
who
hurled
the
silver
bowl
at
my
head
the
wretch
oh
yes
repeated
françois
the
wretch
you
are
right
my
children
said
catharine
without
appearing
to
understand
the
feelings
which
incited
both
of
her
sons
to
speak
you
are
right
for
a
single
indiscreet
act
of
this
gentleman
might
cause
a
horrible
scandal
and
ruin
a
daughter
of
france
one
moment
of
madness
would
be
enough
for
that
or
of
vanity
said
françois
no
doubt
no
doubt
said
charles
and
yet
we
can
not
bring
the
case
into
court
unless
henriot
consents
to
appear
as
plaintiff
my
son
said
catharine
placing
her
hand
on
charles
shoulder
in
such
a
way
as
to
call
the
king
attention
to
what
she
was
about
to
propose
listen
to
what
i
say
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
there
may
be
scandal
but
this
sort
of
offence
to
royalty
is
not
punished
by
judges
and
hangmen
if
you
were
simple
gentlemen
i
should
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
for
you
are
both
brave
but
you
are
princes
you
can
not
cross
swords
with
mere
country
squires
think
how
you
can
avenge
yourselves
as
princes
the
devil
cried
charles
you
are
right
mother
and
i
will
consider
it
i
will
help
you
brother
cried
françois
and
i
said
catharine
unfastening
the
black
silk
girdle
which
was
wound
three
times
about
her
waist
and
the
two
tassels
of
which
fell
to
her
knees
i
will
retire
but
i
leave
you
this
to
represent
me
and
she
threw
the
girdle
at
the
feet
of
the
two
princes
ah
ah
said
charles
i
understand
this
girdle
said
picking
it
up
is
punishment
and
silence
said
catharine
victorious
but
she
added
there
would
be
no
harm
in
mentioning
this
to
henry
she
withdrew
by
heaven
said
a
good
idea
and
when
henry
knows
that
his
wife
has
betrayed
him
so
he
added
turning
to
the
king
you
will
adopt
our
mother
suggestion
in
every
detail
said
charles
not
doubting
but
that
he
would
drive
a
thousand
daggers
into
heart
this
will
annoy
marguerite
but
it
will
delight
henriot
then
calling
one
of
his
guards
he
ordered
henry
summoned
but
thinking
better
of
it
no
no
said
he
i
will
go
for
him
myself
do
you
inform
and
de
guise
leaving
his
apartments
he
ascended
the
private
stairway
to
the
second
floor
which
led
to
henry
chamber
chapter
xxxix
projects
of
revenge
henry
took
advantage
of
the
respite
afforded
him
by
his
examination
to
go
to
madame
de
sauve
he
found
orthon
completely
recovered
from
his
but
orthon
could
tell
him
nothing
except
that
some
men
had
broken
into
the
king
rooms
that
the
leader
had
struck
him
with
the
handle
of
his
sword
and
that
the
blow
had
stunned
him
no
one
had
troubled
about
orthon
catharine
had
seen
that
he
had
fainted
and
had
believed
him
to
be
dead
as
he
had
come
to
himself
between
the
departure
of
the
queen
mother
and
the
arrival
of
the
captain
of
the
guards
charged
with
clearing
up
the
room
he
had
taken
refuge
in
madame
de
sauve
apartments
henry
begged
charlotte
to
keep
the
young
man
until
news
came
from
de
mouy
who
would
not
fail
to
write
him
from
his
then
he
would
send
orthon
to
carry
his
answer
to
de
mouy
and
instead
of
one
devoted
man
he
could
count
on
two
this
decided
on
he
returned
to
his
rooms
and
began
further
to
consider
matters
walking
up
and
down
the
while
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
the
king
appeared
your
majesty
cried
henry
rising
to
meet
him
in
person
really
henriot
you
are
a
good
fellow
and
i
love
you
more
and
more
sire
said
henry
your
majesty
overwhelms
me
you
have
but
one
fault
henriot
what
is
that
the
one
for
which
your
majesty
has
already
reproached
me
several
times
said
henry
my
preferring
to
hunt
animals
rather
than
birds
no
no
i
am
not
referring
to
that
henriot
i
mean
something
else
if
your
majesty
will
explain
said
henry
who
saw
from
the
smile
on
charles
lips
that
the
king
was
in
a
good
humor
i
will
try
and
correct
it
it
is
this
that
having
such
good
eyes
you
see
no
better
than
you
do
bah
said
henry
can
i
be
then
sire
without
knowing
it
worse
than
that
henry
worse
than
that
you
are
blind
ah
indeed
said
the
béarnais
but
is
it
not
when
i
shut
my
eyes
that
this
happens
well
yes
said
charles
you
are
perfectly
capable
of
that
at
all
events
i
am
going
to
open
your
eyes
god
said
there
be
light
and
there
was
light
your
majesty
is
the
representative
of
god
on
earth
therefore
you
can
do
here
what
god
does
in
heaven
proceed
i
am
all
attention
when
de
guise
said
last
night
that
your
wife
had
just
passed
escorted
by
a
gallant
you
would
not
believe
it
sire
said
henry
how
could
i
believe
that
the
sister
of
your
majesty
could
commit
an
act
of
such
imprudence
when
he
told
you
that
your
wife
had
gone
to
the
rue
cloche
percée
you
would
not
believe
that
either
how
was
i
to
suppose
sire
that
a
daughter
of
france
would
thus
publicly
risk
her
reputation
when
we
besieged
the
house
in
the
rue
cloche
percée
and
when
i
had
a
silver
bowl
hurled
at
my
shoulder
some
orange
marmalade
on
his
head
and
de
guise
a
haunch
of
venison
in
the
face
you
saw
two
women
and
two
men
did
you
not
i
saw
nothing
sire
does
not
your
majesty
remember
that
i
was
questioning
the
janitor
yes
but
by
heaven
i
saw
ah
if
your
majesty
saw
anything
that
is
a
different
thing
i
saw
two
men
and
two
women
well
i
know
now
beyond
a
doubt
that
one
of
the
women
was
margot
and
that
one
of
the
men
was
monsieur
de
la
mole
well
said
henry
if
monsieur
de
la
mole
was
in
the
rue
cloche
percée
he
was
not
here
no
said
charles
he
was
not
here
but
never
mind
who
was
here
we
shall
know
this
as
soon
as
that
imbecile
of
a
maurevel
is
able
to
speak
or
write
the
point
is
that
margot
is
deceiving
you
bah
said
henry
do
not
believe
such
nonsense
when
i
tell
you
that
you
are
more
than
that
you
are
blind
the
devil
will
you
believe
me
just
once
stupid
i
tell
you
that
margot
is
deceiving
you
and
that
this
evening
we
are
going
to
strangle
her
lover
henry
gave
a
start
of
surprise
and
looked
at
his
in
amazement
confess
henry
that
at
heart
you
are
not
sorry
margot
will
cry
out
like
a
thousand
niobes
but
faith
so
much
the
worse
i
do
not
want
you
to
be
made
a
fool
of
if
condé
is
deceived
by
the
duc
i
will
wink
condé
is
my
enemy
but
you
are
my
brother
more
than
this
you
are
my
friend
but
sire
and
i
do
not
want
you
to
be
annoyed
and
made
a
fool
of
you
have
been
a
quintain
long
enough
for
all
these
popinjays
who
come
from
the
provinces
to
gather
our
crumbs
and
court
our
women
let
them
come
or
rather
let
them
come
again
by
heaven
you
have
been
deceived
henriot
that
might
happen
to
any
one
but
i
swear
you
shall
have
shining
satisfaction
and
they
shall
say
in
the
name
of
a
thousand
devils
it
seems
that
king
charles
loves
his
brother
henriot
for
last
night
he
had
monsieur
de
la
mole
tongue
pulled
out
in
a
most
amusing
manner
is
this
really
decided
on
sire
asked
henry
decided
on
determined
on
arranged
the
coxcomb
will
have
no
time
to
plead
his
cause
the
expedition
will
consist
of
myself
and
de
guise
a
king
two
sons
of
france
and
a
sovereign
prince
without
counting
you
how
without
counting
me
why
you
are
to
be
one
of
us
i
yes
you
you
shall
stab
the
fellow
in
a
royal
manner
while
the
rest
of
us
strangle
him
sire
said
henry
your
kindness
overpowers
me
but
how
do
you
know
why
the
devil
it
seems
that
the
fellow
boasts
of
it
he
goes
sometimes
to
your
wife
apartments
in
the
louvre
sometimes
to
the
rue
cloche
percée
they
compose
verses
together
i
should
like
to
see
the
stanzas
that
fop
writes
pastorales
they
are
they
discuss
bion
and
moschus
and
read
first
daphne
and
then
corydon
ah
take
a
good
dagger
with
you
sire
said
henry
upon
reflection
what
your
majesty
will
see
that
i
can
not
join
such
an
expedition
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
inconvenient
to
be
there
in
person
i
am
too
much
interested
in
the
affair
to
take
any
calm
part
in
it
your
majesty
will
avenge
the
honor
of
your
sister
on
a
coxcomb
who
boasts
of
having
calumniated
my
wife
nothing
is
simpler
and
marguerite
whom
i
hold
to
be
innocent
sire
is
in
no
way
dishonored
but
were
i
of
the
party
it
would
be
a
different
thing
my
would
convert
an
act
of
justice
into
an
act
of
revenge
it
would
no
longer
be
an
execution
but
an
assassination
my
wife
would
no
longer
be
calumniated
but
guilty
by
heaven
henry
as
i
said
just
now
to
my
mother
you
speak
words
of
wisdom
you
have
a
devilishly
quick
mind
and
charles
gazed
complacently
at
his
who
bowed
in
return
for
the
compliment
nevertheless
added
charles
you
are
willing
to
be
rid
of
this
coxcomb
are
you
not
everything
your
majesty
does
is
well
done
replied
the
king
of
navarre
well
well
let
me
do
your
work
for
you
you
may
be
sure
it
shall
not
be
the
worse
for
it
i
leave
it
to
you
sire
said
henry
at
what
time
does
he
usually
go
to
your
wife
room
about
nine
and
he
leaves
before
i
reach
there
for
i
never
see
him
about
about
eleven
very
well
come
this
evening
at
midnight
the
deed
will
be
done
charles
pressed
henry
hand
cordially
and
renewing
his
vows
of
friendship
left
the
apartment
whistling
his
favorite
saint
gris
said
the
béarnais
watching
charles
either
i
am
greatly
mistaken
or
the
queen
mother
is
responsible
for
all
this
deviltry
truly
she
does
nothing
but
invent
plots
to
make
trouble
between
my
wife
and
myself
such
a
pleasant
household
and
henry
began
to
laugh
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
laughing
when
no
one
could
see
or
hear
him
about
seven
that
evening
a
handsome
young
man
who
had
just
taken
a
bath
was
finishing
his
toilet
as
he
calmly
moved
about
his
room
humming
a
little
air
before
a
mirror
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
louvre
near
him
another
young
man
was
sleeping
or
rather
lying
on
a
bed
the
one
was
our
friend
la
mole
who
unconsciously
had
been
the
object
of
so
much
discussion
all
day
the
other
was
his
companion
coconnas
the
great
storm
had
passed
over
him
without
his
having
heard
the
rumble
of
the
thunder
or
seen
the
lightning
he
had
returned
at
three
in
the
morning
had
stayed
in
bed
until
three
in
the
afternoon
half
asleep
half
awake
building
castles
on
that
uncertain
sand
called
the
future
then
he
had
risen
had
spent
an
hour
at
a
fashionable
bath
had
dined
at
maître
la
hurière
and
returning
to
the
louvre
had
set
himself
to
finish
his
toilet
before
making
his
usual
call
on
the
queen
and
you
say
you
have
dined
asked
coconnas
yawning
faith
yes
and
i
was
hungry
too
why
did
you
not
take
me
with
you
selfish
man
faith
you
were
sleeping
so
soundly
that
i
did
not
like
to
waken
you
but
you
shall
sup
with
me
instead
be
sure
not
to
forget
to
ask
maître
la
hurière
for
some
of
that
light
wine
from
anjou
which
arrived
a
few
days
ago
is
it
good
i
merely
tell
you
to
ask
for
it
where
are
you
going
where
am
i
going
said
la
mole
surprised
that
his
friend
should
ask
him
such
a
question
i
am
going
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
queen
well
said
coconnas
if
i
were
going
to
dine
in
our
little
house
in
the
rue
cloche
percée
i
should
have
what
was
left
over
from
yesterday
there
is
a
certain
wine
of
alicante
which
is
most
refreshing
it
would
be
imprudent
to
go
there
annibal
my
friend
after
what
occurred
last
night
besides
did
we
not
promise
that
we
would
not
go
back
there
alone
hand
me
my
cloak
that
is
so
said
coconnas
i
had
forgotten
but
where
the
devil
is
your
cloak
ah
here
it
is
no
you
have
given
me
the
black
one
and
it
is
the
red
one
i
want
the
queen
likes
me
better
in
that
ah
faith
said
coconnas
searching
everywhere
look
for
yourself
i
can
not
find
it
what
said
la
mole
you
can
not
find
it
why
where
can
it
be
you
probably
sold
it
why
i
have
six
crowns
left
well
take
mine
ah
yes
a
yellow
cloak
with
a
green
doublet
i
should
look
like
a
popinjay
faith
you
are
so
wear
what
you
please
having
tossed
everything
in
his
search
la
mole
was
beginning
to
abuse
the
thieves
who
managed
to
enter
even
the
louvre
when
a
page
from
the
duc
appeared
bringing
the
precious
cloak
in
question
ah
cried
la
mole
here
it
is
at
last
is
this
your
cloak
monsieur
said
the
page
yes
monseigneur
sent
for
it
to
decide
a
wager
he
made
regarding
its
color
oh
said
la
mole
i
asked
for
it
only
because
i
was
going
out
but
if
his
highness
desires
to
keep
it
longer
no
monsieur
le
comte
he
is
through
with
it
the
page
left
la
mole
fastened
his
cloak
well
he
went
on
what
have
you
decided
to
do
i
do
not
know
shall
i
find
you
here
this
evening
how
can
i
tell
do
you
not
know
what
you
are
going
to
do
for
two
hours
i
know
well
enough
what
i
shall
do
but
i
do
not
know
what
i
may
be
ordered
to
do
by
the
duchesse
de
nevers
no
by
the
duc
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
la
mole
i
have
noticed
for
some
time
that
he
has
been
friendly
to
you
yes
said
coconnas
then
your
fortune
is
made
said
la
mole
laughing
poof
said
coconnas
he
is
only
a
younger
brother
oh
said
la
mole
he
is
so
anxious
to
become
the
elder
one
that
perhaps
heaven
will
work
some
miracle
in
his
favor
so
you
do
not
know
where
you
will
be
this
evening
no
go
to
the
devil
then
i
mean
that
la
mole
is
a
terrible
fellow
thought
coconnas
always
wanting
me
to
tell
him
where
i
am
going
to
be
as
if
i
knew
besides
i
believe
i
am
sleepy
and
he
threw
himself
on
the
bed
again
la
mole
betook
himself
to
the
apartments
of
the
queen
in
the
corridor
he
met
the
duc
ah
you
here
monsieur
la
mole
said
the
prince
yes
my
lord
replied
la
mole
bowing
respectfully
are
you
going
away
from
the
louvre
no
your
highness
i
am
on
my
way
to
pay
my
respects
to
her
majesty
the
queen
of
navarre
about
what
time
shall
you
leave
monsieur
de
la
mole
has
monseigneur
any
orders
for
me
no
not
at
present
but
i
shall
want
to
speak
to
you
this
evening
about
what
time
between
nine
and
ten
i
shall
do
myself
the
honor
of
waiting
on
your
highness
at
that
time
very
good
i
shall
depend
on
you
la
mole
bowed
and
went
on
there
are
times
said
he
when
the
duke
is
as
pale
as
death
it
is
very
strange
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
queen
apartments
gillonne
who
apparently
was
expecting
him
led
him
to
marguerite
the
latter
was
occupied
with
some
work
which
seemed
to
be
wearying
her
greatly
a
paper
covered
with
notes
and
a
volume
of
isocrates
lay
before
her
she
signed
to
la
mole
to
let
her
finish
a
paragraph
then
in
a
few
moments
she
threw
down
her
pen
and
invited
the
young
man
to
sit
beside
her
la
mole
was
radiant
never
had
he
been
so
handsome
or
so
greek
said
he
glancing
at
the
book
a
speech
of
isocrates
what
are
you
doing
with
that
ah
and
latin
on
this
sheet
of
paper
sarmatiæ
legatos
reginæ
margaritæ
concio
so
you
are
going
to
harangue
these
barbarians
in
latin
i
must
said
marguerite
since
they
do
not
speak
french
but
how
can
you
write
the
answer
before
you
have
the
speech
a
greater
coquette
than
i
would
make
you
believe
that
this
was
impromptu
but
i
can
not
deceive
you
my
hyacinthe
i
was
told
the
speech
in
advance
and
i
am
answering
it
are
these
ambassadors
about
to
arrive
better
still
they
arrived
this
morning
does
any
one
know
it
they
came
incognito
their
formal
arrival
is
planned
for
afternoon
i
believe
and
you
will
see
said
marguerite
with
a
little
satisfied
air
not
wholly
free
from
pedantry
that
what
i
have
done
this
evening
is
quite
ciceronian
but
let
us
drop
these
important
matters
and
speak
of
what
has
happened
to
you
to
me
yes
what
has
happened
to
me
ah
it
is
in
vain
you
pretend
to
be
brave
you
look
pale
then
it
is
from
having
slept
too
much
i
am
humbly
sorry
for
it
come
come
let
us
not
play
the
braggart
i
know
everything
have
the
kindness
to
inform
me
then
my
pearl
for
i
know
nothing
well
answer
me
frankly
what
did
the
queen
mother
ask
you
had
she
something
to
say
to
me
what
have
you
not
seen
her
no
nor
king
charles
no
nor
the
king
of
navarre
no
but
you
have
seen
the
duc
yes
i
met
him
just
now
in
the
corridor
what
did
he
say
to
you
that
he
had
some
orders
to
give
me
between
nine
and
ten
this
evening
nothing
else
nothing
else
that
is
strange
but
what
is
strange
tell
me
that
nothing
has
been
said
to
you
what
has
happened
all
day
unfortunately
you
have
been
hanging
over
an
abyss
i
yes
you
why
well
listen
it
seems
that
last
night
de
mouy
was
surprised
in
the
apartments
of
the
king
of
navarre
who
was
to
have
been
arrested
de
mouy
killed
three
men
and
escaped
without
anything
about
him
having
been
recognized
except
the
famous
red
cloak
well
well
this
red
cloak
which
once
deceived
me
has
thrown
others
besides
myself
off
the
track
you
have
been
suspected
and
even
accused
of
this
triple
murder
this
morning
they
wanted
to
arrest
judge
and
perhaps
convict
you
who
knows
for
in
order
to
save
yourself
you
would
not
have
told
where
you
were
would
you
tell
where
i
was
cried
la
mole
compromise
you
my
beautiful
queen
oh
you
are
right
i
should
have
died
singing
to
spare
your
sweet
eyes
one
tear
alas
said
marguerite
my
sweet
eyes
would
have
been
filled
with
many
many
tears
but
what
caused
the
great
storm
to
subside
guess
how
can
i
tell
there
was
only
one
way
to
prove
that
you
were
not
in
the
king
room
and
that
was
to
tell
where
you
were
well
well
i
told
whom
did
you
tell
my
mother
and
queen
catharine
queen
catharine
knows
that
i
love
you
oh
madame
after
having
done
so
much
for
me
you
can
demand
anything
from
your
servant
ah
marguerite
truly
what
you
did
was
noble
and
beautiful
my
life
is
yours
marguerite
i
hope
so
for
i
have
snatched
it
from
those
who
wanted
to
take
it
from
me
but
now
you
are
saved
and
by
you
cried
the
young
man
by
my
adored
queen
at
that
instant
a
sharp
noise
made
them
start
la
mole
sprang
back
filled
with
a
vague
terror
marguerite
uttered
a
cry
and
stood
with
her
eyes
riveted
on
the
broken
glass
of
one
of
the
through
this
window
a
stone
the
size
of
an
egg
had
entered
and
lay
on
the
floor
la
mole
saw
the
broken
pane
and
realized
the
cause
of
the
noise
who
dared
to
do
this
he
cried
springing
to
the
window
one
moment
said
marguerite
it
seems
to
me
that
something
is
tied
around
the
stone
yes
said
la
mole
it
looks
like
a
piece
of
paper
marguerite
went
to
the
strange
projectile
and
removed
the
thin
sheet
which
folded
like
a
narrow
band
encircled
the
middle
of
the
stone
the
paper
was
attached
to
a
cord
which
came
through
the
broken
window
marguerite
unfolded
the
letter
and
read
unfortunate
man
she
cried
holding
out
the
paper
to
la
mole
who
stood
as
pale
and
motionless
as
a
statue
of
terror
with
a
heart
filled
with
gloomy
forebodings
he
read
these
words
are
waiting
for
monsieur
de
la
mole
with
long
swords
in
the
corridor
leading
to
the
apartments
of
monsieur
perhaps
he
would
prefer
to
escape
by
this
window
and
join
monsieur
de
mouy
at
well
asked
la
mole
after
reading
it
are
these
swords
longer
than
mine
no
but
there
may
be
ten
against
one
who
is
the
friend
who
has
sent
us
this
note
asked
la
mole
marguerite
took
it
from
the
young
man
hand
and
looked
at
it
attentively
the
king
of
navarre
handwriting
she
cried
if
he
warns
us
the
danger
is
great
flee
la
mole
flee
i
beg
you
how
asked
la
mole
by
this
window
does
not
the
note
refer
to
it
command
my
queen
and
i
will
leap
from
the
window
to
obey
you
if
i
broke
my
head
twenty
times
by
the
fall
wait
wait
said
marguerite
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
weight
attached
to
this
cord
let
us
see
said
la
mole
both
drew
up
the
cord
and
with
indescribable
joy
saw
a
ladder
of
hair
and
silk
at
the
end
of
it
ah
you
are
saved
cried
marguerite
it
is
a
miracle
of
heaven
no
it
is
a
gift
from
the
king
of
navarre
but
suppose
it
were
a
snare
said
la
mole
if
this
ladder
were
to
break
under
me
madame
did
you
not
acknowledge
your
love
for
me
marguerite
whose
joy
had
dissipated
her
grief
became
ashy
pale
you
are
right
said
she
that
is
possible
she
started
to
the
door
what
are
you
going
to
do
cried
la
mole
to
find
out
if
they
are
really
waiting
for
you
in
the
corridor
never
never
for
their
anger
to
fall
on
you
what
can
they
do
to
a
daughter
of
france
as
a
woman
and
a
royal
princess
i
am
doubly
inviolable
the
queen
uttered
these
words
with
so
much
dignity
that
la
mole
understood
she
ran
no
risk
and
that
he
must
let
her
do
as
she
wished
marguerite
put
la
mole
under
the
protection
of
gillonne
leaving
to
him
to
decide
according
to
circumstances
whether
to
run
or
await
her
return
and
started
down
the
corridor
a
side
hall
led
to
the
library
as
well
as
to
several
and
at
the
end
led
to
the
apartments
of
the
king
the
queen
mother
and
to
the
small
private
stairway
by
which
one
reached
the
apartments
of
the
duc
and
henry
although
it
was
scarcely
nine
all
the
lights
were
extinguished
and
the
corridor
except
for
the
dim
glimmer
which
came
from
the
side
hall
was
quite
dark
the
queen
of
navarre
advanced
boldly
when
she
had
gone
about
a
third
of
the
distance
she
heard
whispering
which
sounded
mysterious
and
startling
from
an
evident
effort
made
to
suppress
it
it
ceased
almost
instantly
as
if
by
order
from
some
superior
and
silence
was
restored
the
light
dim
as
it
was
seemed
to
grow
less
marguerite
walked
on
directly
into
the
face
of
the
danger
if
danger
there
was
to
all
appearances
she
was
calm
although
her
clinched
hands
indicated
a
violent
nervous
tension
as
she
approached
the
intense
silence
increased
while
a
shadow
like
that
of
a
hand
obscured
the
wavering
and
uncertain
light
at
the
point
where
the
transverse
hall
crossed
the
main
corridor
a
man
sprang
in
front
of
the
queen
uncovered
a
red
candlestick
and
cried
out
here
he
is
marguerite
stood
face
to
face
with
her
brother
charles
behind
him
a
silken
cord
in
hand
was
the
duc
at
the
rear
in
the
darkness
stood
two
figures
side
by
side
reflecting
no
light
other
than
that
of
the
drawn
swords
which
they
held
in
their
hands
marguerite
saw
everything
at
a
glance
making
a
supreme
effort
she
said
smilingly
to
charles
you
mean
here
is
sire
charles
recoiled
the
others
stood
motionless
you
margot
said
he
where
are
you
going
at
this
hour
at
this
hour
said
marguerite
is
it
so
late
i
ask
where
you
are
going
to
find
a
book
of
cicero
speeches
which
i
think
i
left
at
our
mother
without
a
light
i
supposed
the
corridor
was
lighted
do
you
come
from
your
own
apartments
yes
what
are
you
doing
this
evening
preparing
my
address
for
the
polish
ambassadors
is
there
not
a
council
and
does
not
each
one
have
to
submit
his
address
to
your
majesty
have
you
not
some
one
helping
you
with
this
work
marguerite
summoned
all
her
strength
yes
brother
said
she
monsieur
de
la
mole
he
is
very
learned
so
much
so
said
the
duc
that
i
asked
him
when
he
had
finished
with
you
sister
to
come
and
help
me
for
i
am
not
as
clever
as
you
are
and
were
you
waiting
for
him
asked
marguerite
as
naturally
as
possible
yes
said
impatiently
then
said
marguerite
i
will
send
him
to
you
brother
for
we
have
finished
my
work
but
your
book
said
charles
i
will
have
gillonne
get
it
the
two
brothers
exchanged
a
sign
go
said
charles
and
we
will
continue
our
round
your
round
said
marguerite
whom
are
you
looking
for
the
little
red
man
said
charles
do
you
not
know
that
there
is
a
little
red
man
who
is
said
to
haunt
the
old
louvre
my
brother
claims
to
have
seen
him
and
we
are
looking
for
him
good
luck
to
you
said
marguerite
and
she
turned
round
glancing
behind
her
she
saw
the
four
figures
gather
close
to
the
wall
as
if
in
conference
in
an
instant
she
had
reached
her
own
door
open
gillonne
said
she
open
gillonne
obeyed
marguerite
sprang
into
the
room
and
found
la
mole
waiting
for
her
calm
and
quiet
but
with
drawn
sword
flee
said
she
flee
do
not
lose
a
second
they
are
waiting
for
you
in
the
corridor
to
kill
you
you
command
me
to
do
this
said
la
mole
i
command
it
we
must
part
in
order
to
see
each
other
again
while
marguerite
had
been
away
la
mole
had
made
sure
of
the
ladder
at
the
window
he
now
stepped
out
but
before
placing
his
foot
on
the
first
round
he
tenderly
kissed
the
queen
hand
if
the
ladder
is
a
trap
and
i
should
perish
marguerite
remember
your
promise
it
was
not
a
promise
la
mole
but
an
oath
fear
nothing
adieu
and
la
mole
thus
encouraged
let
himself
slip
down
the
ladder
at
the
same
instant
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
marguerite
watched
la
mole
perilous
descent
and
did
not
turn
away
from
the
window
until
she
was
sure
he
had
reached
the
ground
in
safety
madame
said
gillonne
madame
well
asked
marguerite
the
king
is
knocking
at
the
door
open
it
gillonne
did
so
the
four
princes
impatient
at
waiting
no
doubt
stood
on
the
threshold
charles
entered
marguerite
came
forward
a
smile
on
her
lips
the
king
cast
a
rapid
glance
around
whom
are
you
looking
for
brother
asked
marguerite
why
said
charles
i
am
looking
i
am
looking
why
the
devil
i
am
looking
for
monsieur
de
la
mole
monsieur
de
la
mole
yes
where
is
he
marguerite
took
her
brother
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
the
window
just
then
two
horsemen
were
seen
galloping
away
around
the
wooden
tower
one
of
them
unfastened
his
white
satin
scarf
and
waved
it
in
the
darkness
as
a
sign
of
adieu
the
two
men
were
la
mole
and
orthon
marguerite
pointed
them
out
to
charles
well
said
the
king
what
does
this
mean
it
means
replied
marguerite
that
monsieur
le
duc
may
put
his
cord
back
into
his
pocket
and
that
messieurs
and
de
guise
may
sheathe
their
swords
for
monsieur
de
la
mole
will
not
pass
through
the
corridor
again
chapter
xl
the
atrides
since
his
return
to
paris
henry
of
anjou
had
not
seen
his
mother
catharine
alone
and
as
every
one
knows
he
was
her
favorite
son
this
visit
was
not
merely
for
the
sake
of
etiquette
nor
the
carrying
out
of
a
painful
ceremony
but
the
accomplishment
of
a
very
sweet
duty
for
this
son
who
if
he
did
not
love
his
mother
was
at
least
sure
of
being
tenderly
loved
by
her
catharine
loved
this
son
best
either
because
of
his
bravery
his
beauty
for
besides
the
mother
there
was
the
woman
in
catharine
or
because
according
to
some
scandalous
chronicles
henry
of
anjou
reminded
the
florentine
of
a
certain
happy
epoch
of
secret
love
catharine
alone
knew
of
the
return
of
the
duc
to
paris
charles
ix
would
have
been
ignorant
of
it
had
not
chance
led
him
to
the
hôtel
de
condé
just
as
his
brother
was
leaving
it
charles
had
not
expected
him
until
the
following
day
and
henry
of
anjou
had
hoped
to
conceal
from
him
the
two
motives
which
had
hastened
his
arrival
by
a
day
namely
his
visit
to
the
beautiful
marie
of
clèves
princess
of
condé
and
his
conference
with
the
polish
ambassadors
it
was
this
last
reason
of
the
object
of
which
charles
was
uncertain
which
the
duc
had
to
explain
to
his
mother
and
the
reader
ignorant
on
this
point
as
was
henry
of
navarre
will
profit
by
the
explanation
when
the
duc
so
long
expected
entered
his
mother
rooms
catharine
usually
so
cold
and
formal
and
who
since
the
departure
of
her
favorite
son
had
embraced
with
effusion
no
one
but
coligny
who
was
to
be
assassinated
the
following
day
opened
her
arms
to
the
child
of
her
love
and
pressed
him
to
her
heart
with
a
burst
of
maternal
affection
most
surprising
in
a
heart
already
long
grown
cold
then
pushing
him
from
her
she
gazed
at
him
and
again
drew
him
into
her
arms
ah
madame
said
he
since
heaven
grants
me
the
privilege
of
embracing
my
mother
in
private
console
me
for
i
am
the
most
wretched
man
alive
oh
my
god
my
beloved
child
cried
catharine
what
has
happened
to
you
nothing
which
you
do
not
know
mother
i
am
in
love
i
am
loved
but
it
is
this
very
love
which
is
the
cause
of
my
unhappiness
tell
me
about
it
my
son
said
catharine
well
mother
these
ambassadors
this
departure
yes
said
catharine
the
ambassadors
have
arrived
the
departure
is
near
at
hand
it
need
not
be
near
at
hand
mother
but
my
brother
hastens
it
he
detests
me
i
am
in
his
way
and
he
wants
to
rid
himself
of
me
catharine
smiled
by
giving
you
a
throne
poor
unhappy
crowned
head
oh
no
mother
said
henry
in
agony
i
do
not
wish
to
go
away
i
a
son
of
france
brought
up
in
the
refinement
of
polite
society
near
the
best
of
mothers
loved
by
one
of
the
dearest
women
in
the
world
must
i
go
among
snows
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
die
by
inches
among
those
rough
people
who
are
intoxicated
from
morning
until
night
and
who
gauge
the
capacity
of
their
king
by
that
of
a
cask
according
to
what
he
can
hold
no
mother
i
do
not
want
to
go
i
should
die
come
henry
said
catharine
pressing
her
son
hands
come
is
that
the
real
reason
henry
eyes
fell
as
though
even
to
his
mother
he
did
not
dare
to
confess
what
was
in
his
heart
is
there
no
other
reason
asked
catharine
less
romantic
but
more
rational
more
political
mother
it
is
not
my
fault
if
this
thought
comes
to
me
and
takes
stronger
hold
of
me
perhaps
than
it
should
but
did
not
you
yourself
tell
me
that
the
horoscope
of
my
brother
charles
prophesied
that
he
would
die
young
yes
said
catharine
but
a
horoscope
may
lie
my
son
indeed
i
myself
hope
that
all
horoscopes
are
not
true
but
his
horoscope
said
this
did
it
not
his
horoscope
spoke
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
but
it
did
not
say
whether
it
referred
to
his
life
or
his
reign
well
mother
bring
it
about
so
that
i
can
stay
my
brother
is
almost
in
one
year
the
question
will
be
settled
catharine
pondered
deeply
yes
said
she
it
would
certainly
be
better
if
it
could
be
so
arranged
oh
imagine
my
despair
mother
cried
henry
if
i
were
to
exchange
the
crown
of
france
for
that
of
poland
my
being
tormented
there
with
the
idea
that
i
might
be
reigning
in
the
louvre
in
the
midst
of
this
elegant
and
lettered
court
near
the
best
mother
in
the
world
whose
advice
would
spare
me
half
my
work
and
fatigue
who
accustomed
to
bearing
with
my
father
a
portion
of
the
burden
of
the
state
would
like
to
bear
it
with
me
too
ah
mother
i
should
have
been
a
great
king
there
there
dear
child
said
catharine
to
whom
this
outlook
had
always
been
a
very
sweet
hope
there
do
not
despair
have
you
thought
of
any
way
of
arranging
the
matter
oh
yes
certainly
and
that
is
why
i
came
back
two
or
three
days
before
i
was
expected
letting
my
brother
charles
suppose
that
it
was
on
account
of
madame
de
condé
then
i
have
been
with
de
lasco
the
chief
ambassador
i
became
acquainted
with
him
and
did
all
i
could
in
that
first
interview
to
make
him
hate
me
i
hope
i
have
succeeded
ah
my
dear
child
said
catharine
that
is
wrong
you
must
place
the
interest
of
france
above
your
petty
dislikes
mother
in
case
any
accident
happened
to
my
brother
would
it
be
to
the
interest
of
france
for
the
duc
or
the
king
of
navarre
to
reign
oh
the
king
of
navarre
never
never
murmured
catharine
letting
anxiety
cover
her
face
with
that
veil
of
care
which
spread
over
it
every
time
this
question
arose
faith
continued
henry
my
brother
is
not
worth
much
more
and
is
no
fonder
of
you
well
said
catharine
what
did
lasco
say
even
lasco
hesitated
when
i
urged
him
to
seek
an
audience
oh
if
he
could
write
to
poland
and
annul
this
election
folly
my
son
madness
what
a
diet
has
consecrated
is
sacred
but
mother
could
not
these
poles
be
prevailed
on
to
accept
my
brother
in
my
stead
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
said
catharine
never
mind
try
make
the
attempt
speak
to
the
king
mother
ascribe
everything
to
my
love
for
madame
de
condé
say
that
i
am
mad
over
her
that
i
am
losing
my
mind
he
saw
me
coming
out
of
the
prince
hôtel
with
de
guise
who
did
everything
for
me
a
friend
could
do
yes
in
order
to
help
the
league
you
do
not
see
this
but
i
do
yes
mother
yes
but
meanwhile
i
am
making
use
of
him
should
we
not
be
glad
when
a
man
serves
us
while
serving
himself
and
what
did
the
king
say
when
he
met
you
he
apparently
believed
what
i
told
him
that
love
alone
had
brought
me
back
to
paris
but
did
he
ask
you
what
you
did
the
rest
of
the
night
yes
mother
but
i
had
supper
at
nantouillet
where
i
made
a
frightful
riot
so
that
the
report
of
it
might
get
abroad
and
deceive
the
king
as
to
where
i
was
then
he
is
ignorant
of
your
visit
to
lasco
absolutely
good
so
much
the
better
i
will
try
to
influence
him
in
your
favor
dear
child
but
you
know
no
influence
makes
any
impression
on
his
coarse
nature
oh
mother
mother
what
happiness
if
i
could
stay
i
would
love
you
even
more
than
i
do
now
if
that
were
possible
if
you
stay
you
will
be
sent
to
war
oh
never
mind
if
only
i
do
not
have
to
leave
france
you
will
be
killed
mother
one
does
not
die
from
blows
one
dies
from
grief
from
meanness
but
charles
will
not
let
me
remain
he
hates
me
he
is
jealous
of
you
my
beautiful
conqueror
that
is
well
known
why
are
you
so
brave
and
so
fortunate
why
at
scarcely
twenty
years
of
age
have
you
won
battles
like
alexander
or
cæsar
but
in
the
meantime
do
not
let
your
wishes
be
known
to
any
one
pretend
to
be
resigned
pay
your
court
to
the
king
there
is
a
private
council
to
read
and
discuss
the
speeches
which
are
to
be
made
at
the
ceremony
act
like
the
king
of
poland
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
by
the
way
how
about
your
expedition
of
last
night
it
failed
mother
the
gallant
was
warned
and
escaped
by
the
window
well
said
catharine
some
day
i
shall
know
who
this
evil
genius
is
who
upsets
all
my
plans
in
this
way
meanwhile
i
suspect
and
let
him
beware
so
mother
said
the
duc
let
me
manage
this
affair
she
kissed
henry
tenderly
on
his
eyes
and
pushed
him
from
the
room
before
long
the
princes
of
her
household
arrived
at
the
rooms
of
the
queen
charles
was
in
a
good
humor
for
the
cleverness
of
his
sister
margot
had
pleased
rather
than
vexed
him
moreover
he
had
nothing
against
la
mole
and
he
had
waited
for
him
somewhat
eagerly
in
the
corridor
merely
because
it
was
a
kind
of
hunt
on
the
contrary
was
greatly
preoccupied
the
repulsion
he
had
always
felt
for
la
mole
had
turned
into
hate
the
instant
he
knew
that
la
mole
was
loved
by
his
sister
marguerite
possessed
both
a
dreamy
mind
and
a
quick
eye
she
had
to
remember
as
well
as
to
watch
the
polish
deputies
had
sent
a
copy
of
the
speeches
which
they
were
to
make
marguerite
to
whom
no
more
mention
had
been
made
of
the
affair
of
the
previous
evening
than
as
if
it
had
never
occurred
read
the
speeches
and
except
charles
every
one
discussed
what
he
would
answer
charles
let
marguerite
reply
as
she
pleased
as
far
as
was
concerned
he
was
very
particular
as
to
the
choice
of
terms
but
as
to
the
discourse
of
henry
of
anjou
he
seemed
determined
to
attack
it
and
made
numerous
corrections
this
council
without
being
in
any
way
decisive
had
greatly
embittered
the
feelings
of
those
present
henry
of
anjou
who
had
to
rewrite
nearly
all
his
discourse
withdrew
to
begin
the
task
marguerite
who
had
not
heard
of
the
king
of
navarre
since
the
injury
he
had
given
to
her
returned
to
her
rooms
hoping
to
find
him
there
who
had
read
hesitation
in
the
eyes
of
his
brother
of
anjou
and
who
had
surprised
a
meaning
glance
between
him
and
his
mother
retired
to
ponder
on
what
he
regarded
as
a
fresh
plot
charles
was
about
to
go
to
his
workshop
to
finish
a
he
was
making
for
himself
when
catharine
stopped
him
the
king
who
suspected
that
he
was
to
meet
some
opposition
to
his
will
paused
and
looked
at
his
mother
closely
well
he
said
what
now
a
final
word
sire
which
we
forgot
and
yet
it
is
of
much
importance
what
day
shall
we
decide
on
for
the
public
reception
ah
that
is
true
said
the
king
seating
himself
again
well
what
day
would
suit
you
i
thought
replied
catharine
from
your
majesty
silence
and
apparent
forgetfulness
that
there
was
some
plan
no
said
charles
why
so
mother
because
added
catharine
very
gently
it
seems
to
me
my
son
that
these
poles
should
not
see
us
so
eager
after
their
crown
on
the
contrary
mother
said
charles
it
is
they
who
are
in
haste
they
have
come
from
varsovia
by
forced
marches
honor
for
honor
courtesy
for
courtesy
your
majesty
may
be
right
in
one
sense
i
am
not
curious
so
your
idea
is
that
the
public
reception
should
be
held
soon
faith
yes
mother
is
this
not
your
idea
too
you
know
that
my
ideas
are
only
such
as
can
further
your
glory
i
will
tell
you
therefore
that
by
this
haste
i
fear
you
will
be
accused
of
profiting
very
quickly
by
this
opportunity
to
relieve
the
house
of
france
of
the
burdens
your
brother
imposes
on
it
but
which
he
certainly
returns
in
glory
and
devotion
mother
said
charles
on
his
departure
from
france
i
will
endow
my
brother
so
richly
that
no
one
will
ever
dare
to
think
what
you
fear
may
be
said
well
said
catharine
i
surrender
since
you
have
such
a
ready
reply
to
each
of
my
objections
but
to
receive
this
warlike
people
who
judge
of
the
power
of
the
states
by
exterior
signs
you
must
have
a
considerable
array
of
troops
and
i
do
not
think
there
are
enough
yet
assembled
in
the
isle
de
france
pardon
me
mother
i
have
foreseen
this
event
and
am
prepared
for
it
i
have
recalled
two
battalions
from
normandy
and
one
from
guyenne
my
company
of
archers
arrived
yesterday
from
brittany
the
light
horse
scattered
throughout
lorraine
will
be
in
paris
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
while
it
is
supposed
that
i
have
scarcely
four
regiments
at
my
disposition
i
have
twenty
thousand
men
ready
to
appear
ah
ah
said
catharine
surprised
in
that
case
only
one
thing
is
lacking
but
that
can
be
procured
what
is
that
money
i
believe
that
you
are
not
furnished
with
an
on
the
contrary
madame
on
the
contrary
said
charles
i
have
fourteen
hundred
thousand
crowns
in
the
bastille
my
private
estates
have
yielded
me
during
the
last
few
days
eight
hundred
thousand
crowns
which
i
have
put
in
my
cellar
in
the
louvre
and
in
case
of
need
nantouillet
holds
three
hundred
thousand
crowns
at
my
disposal
catharine
shivered
until
then
she
had
known
charles
to
be
violent
and
passionate
but
never
provident
well
said
she
your
majesty
thinks
of
everything
that
is
fine
and
provided
the
tailors
the
embroiderers
and
the
jewellers
make
haste
your
majesty
will
be
in
a
position
to
hold
this
audience
within
six
weeks
six
weeks
exclaimed
charles
mother
the
tailors
the
embroiderers
and
the
jewellers
have
been
at
work
ever
since
we
heard
of
my
nomination
as
a
matter
of
fact
everything
could
be
ready
but
at
the
latest
it
will
take
only
three
or
four
days
oh
murmured
catharine
you
are
in
greater
haste
than
i
supposed
my
son
honor
for
honor
i
told
you
well
is
it
this
honor
done
to
the
house
of
france
which
flatters
you
certainly
and
is
your
chief
desire
to
see
a
son
of
france
on
the
throne
of
poland
exactly
then
it
is
the
event
the
fact
and
not
the
man
which
is
of
interest
to
you
and
whoever
reigns
there
no
no
mother
by
heaven
let
us
keep
to
the
point
the
poles
have
made
a
good
choice
they
are
a
skilful
and
strong
people
a
military
people
a
nation
of
soldiers
they
choose
a
captain
for
their
ruler
that
is
logical
plague
it
is
just
the
man
for
them
the
hero
of
jarnac
and
montcontour
fits
them
like
a
glove
whom
would
you
have
me
send
them
a
coward
he
would
give
them
a
fine
idea
of
the
valois
he
would
run
at
the
first
bullet
that
whistled
by
his
ears
while
henry
of
anjou
is
a
fighter
yes
his
sword
always
in
his
hand
he
is
ever
pushing
forward
on
foot
or
horseback
forward
thrust
overpower
kill
ah
my
brother
of
anjou
is
a
man
a
valiant
soldier
who
will
lead
them
to
battle
from
morning
until
night
from
one
year
end
to
the
next
he
is
not
a
hard
drinker
it
is
true
but
he
will
kill
in
cold
blood
that
is
all
this
dear
henry
will
be
in
his
element
there
quick
quick
to
battle
sound
the
trumpet
and
the
drum
long
live
the
king
long
live
the
conqueror
long
live
the
general
he
will
be
proclaimed
three
times
a
year
that
will
be
fine
for
the
house
of
france
and
for
the
honor
of
the
valois
he
may
be
killed
but
by
heaven
it
will
be
a
glorious
death
catharine
shuddered
her
eyes
flashed
fire
say
that
you
wish
to
send
henry
of
anjou
away
from
you
she
cried
say
that
you
do
not
love
your
brother
ah
ah
ah
cried
charles
bursting
into
a
nervous
laugh
you
have
guessed
have
you
that
i
want
to
send
him
away
you
have
guessed
that
i
do
not
love
him
and
when
did
you
reach
this
conclusion
come
love
my
brother
why
should
i
love
him
ah
ah
ah
do
you
want
to
make
me
laugh
as
he
spoke
his
pale
cheeks
grew
flushed
with
a
feverish
glow
does
he
love
me
do
you
love
me
has
any
one
except
my
dogs
and
marie
touchet
and
my
nurse
ever
loved
me
no
i
do
not
love
my
brother
i
love
only
myself
do
you
hear
and
i
shall
not
prevent
my
brother
from
doing
as
i
do
sire
said
catharine
growing
excited
on
her
part
since
you
have
opened
your
heart
to
me
i
must
open
mine
to
you
you
are
acting
like
a
weak
king
like
an
monarch
you
are
sending
away
your
second
brother
the
natural
support
of
the
throne
who
is
in
every
way
worthy
to
succeed
you
if
any
accident
happened
in
which
case
your
crown
would
be
left
in
jeopardy
as
you
said
is
young
incapable
weak
more
than
weak
cowardly
and
the
béarnais
rises
up
in
the
background
you
understand
well
the
devil
exclaimed
charles
what
does
it
matter
to
me
what
happens
when
i
am
dead
the
béarnais
rises
behind
my
brother
you
say
by
heaven
so
much
the
better
i
said
that
i
loved
no
one
i
was
mistaken
i
love
henriot
yes
i
love
this
good
henriot
he
has
a
frank
manner
a
warm
handshake
while
i
see
nothing
but
false
looks
around
me
and
touch
only
icy
hands
he
is
incapable
of
treason
towards
me
i
swear
besides
i
owe
him
amends
poor
boy
his
mother
was
poisoned
by
some
members
of
my
family
i
am
told
moreover
i
am
well
but
if
i
were
to
be
taken
ill
i
would
call
him
i
should
want
him
to
stay
with
me
i
would
take
nothing
except
from
him
and
when
i
died
i
would
make
him
king
of
france
and
of
navarre
and
by
heaven
instead
of
laughing
at
my
death
as
my
brothers
would
do
he
would
weep
or
at
least
he
would
pretend
to
weep
had
a
thunderbolt
fallen
at
catharine
feet
she
would
have
been
less
startled
than
at
these
words
she
stood
speechless
gazing
at
charles
with
haggard
eyes
then
at
the
end
of
a
few
moments
henry
of
navarre
she
cried
henry
of
navarre
king
of
france
to
the
detriment
of
my
children
ah
holy
virgin
we
shall
see
so
this
is
why
you
wish
to
send
away
my
son
your
son
and
what
am
i
then
the
son
of
a
wolf
like
romulus
cried
charles
trembling
with
anger
his
eyes
shining
as
though
they
were
on
fire
your
son
you
are
right
the
king
of
france
is
not
your
son
the
king
of
france
has
no
brothers
the
king
of
france
has
no
mother
the
king
of
france
has
only
subjects
the
king
of
france
has
no
need
of
feelings
he
has
wishes
he
can
get
on
without
being
loved
but
he
shall
be
obeyed
sire
you
have
misunderstood
my
words
i
called
my
son
the
one
who
was
going
to
leave
me
i
love
him
better
just
now
because
just
now
he
is
the
one
i
am
most
afraid
i
shall
lose
is
it
a
crime
for
a
mother
to
wish
that
her
child
should
not
leave
her
and
i
i
tell
you
that
he
shall
leave
you
i
tell
you
that
he
shall
leave
france
that
he
shall
go
to
poland
and
within
two
days
too
and
if
you
add
one
word
he
shall
go
moreover
if
you
do
not
smooth
your
brow
if
you
do
not
take
that
threatening
look
from
your
eyes
i
will
strangle
him
this
evening
as
yesterday
you
yourself
would
have
strangled
your
daughter
lover
only
i
shall
not
fail
as
we
failed
in
regard
to
la
mole
at
the
first
threat
catharine
head
fell
but
she
raised
it
again
almost
immediately
ah
poor
child
said
she
your
brother
would
kill
you
but
do
not
fear
your
mother
will
protect
you
ah
you
defy
me
cried
charles
well
by
the
blood
of
christ
he
shall
die
not
this
evening
not
soon
but
this
very
instant
ah
a
weapon
a
dagger
a
knife
ah
having
looked
around
in
vain
for
what
he
wanted
charles
perceived
the
little
dagger
his
mother
always
wore
at
her
belt
sprang
toward
it
snatched
it
from
its
shagreen
case
encrusted
with
silver
and
rushed
from
the
room
to
strike
down
henry
of
anjou
wherever
he
might
meet
him
but
on
reaching
the
hall
his
strength
excited
beyond
human
endurance
suddenly
left
him
he
put
out
his
arm
dropped
the
sharp
weapon
which
stuck
point
downwards
into
the
wood
uttered
a
piercing
cry
sank
down
and
rolled
over
on
the
floor
at
the
same
instant
a
quantity
of
blood
spurted
forth
from
his
mouth
and
nose
jesus
said
he
they
kill
me
help
help
catharine
who
had
followed
saw
him
fall
for
one
instant
she
stood
motionless
watching
him
then
recollecting
herself
not
because
of
any
maternal
affection
but
because
of
the
awkwardness
of
the
situation
she
called
out
the
king
is
ill
help
help
at
the
cry
a
crowd
of
servants
officers
and
courtiers
gathered
around
the
young
king
but
ahead
of
them
all
a
woman
rushed
out
pushed
aside
the
others
and
raised
charles
who
had
grown
as
pale
as
death
they
kill
me
nurse
they
kill
me
murmured
the
king
covered
with
perspiration
and
blood
they
kill
you
my
charles
cried
the
good
woman
glancing
at
the
group
of
faces
with
a
look
which
reached
even
catharine
who
kills
you
charles
heaved
a
feeble
sigh
and
fainted
ah
said
the
physician
ambroise
paré
who
was
summoned
at
once
ah
the
king
is
very
ill
now
from
necessity
or
compulsion
said
the
implacable
catharine
to
herself
he
will
have
to
grant
a
delay
whereupon
she
left
the
king
to
join
her
second
son
who
was
in
the
oratory
anxiously
waiting
to
hear
the
result
of
an
interview
which
was
of
such
importance
to
him
chapter
xli
the
horoscope
on
leaving
the
oratory
in
which
she
had
just
informed
henry
all
that
had
occurred
catharine
found
réné
in
her
chamber
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
queen
and
the
astrologer
had
seen
each
other
since
the
visit
the
queen
had
made
to
his
shop
at
the
pont
saint
michel
but
the
previous
evening
she
had
written
him
and
réné
had
brought
the
answer
to
her
note
in
person
well
said
the
queen
have
you
seen
him
yes
how
is
he
somewhat
better
can
he
speak
no
the
sword
traversed
his
larynx
i
told
you
in
that
case
to
have
him
write
i
tried
he
collected
all
his
strength
but
his
hand
could
trace
only
two
letters
they
are
almost
illegible
then
he
fainted
the
jugular
vein
was
cut
and
the
blood
he
lost
has
taken
away
all
his
strength
have
you
seen
the
letters
here
they
are
réné
drew
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
catharine
who
hastily
unfolded
it
an
and
an
said
she
could
it
have
been
la
mole
and
was
all
that
acting
of
marguerite
done
to
throw
me
off
the
track
madame
said
réné
if
i
dared
to
express
my
opinion
in
a
matter
about
which
your
majesty
hesitates
to
give
yours
i
should
say
that
i
believe
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
too
much
in
love
to
be
seriously
interested
in
politics
you
think
so
yes
and
above
all
too
much
in
love
with
the
queen
of
navarre
to
serve
the
king
very
devotedly
for
there
is
no
real
love
without
jealousy
you
think
that
he
is
very
much
in
love
then
i
am
sure
of
it
has
he
been
to
you
yes
did
he
ask
you
for
some
potion
or
philter
no
we
kept
to
the
wax
figure
pierced
to
the
heart
to
the
heart
and
this
figure
still
exists
yes
have
you
it
it
is
in
my
rooms
it
would
be
strange
said
catharine
if
these
cabalistic
preparations
really
had
the
power
attributed
to
them
your
majesty
is
a
better
judge
of
that
than
i
is
the
queen
of
navarre
in
love
with
monsieur
de
la
mole
she
loves
him
enough
to
ruin
herself
for
him
yesterday
she
saved
him
from
death
at
the
risk
of
her
honor
and
her
life
you
see
madame
and
yet
you
still
doubt
doubt
what
science
science
also
deceives
me
said
catharine
looking
steadily
at
réné
who
bore
her
gaze
without
flinching
about
what
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
unless
of
course
it
was
the
scholar
and
not
science
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
madame
replied
the
florentine
réné
have
your
perfumes
lost
their
odor
no
madame
not
when
i
use
them
but
it
is
possible
that
in
passing
through
the
hands
of
others
catharine
smiled
and
shook
her
head
your
opiate
has
done
wonders
réné
said
she
madame
de
sauve
lips
are
fresher
and
rosier
than
ever
it
is
not
my
opiate
that
is
responsible
for
that
madame
the
baroness
de
sauve
using
the
privilege
of
every
pretty
woman
to
be
capricious
has
said
nothing
more
to
me
about
this
opiate
and
after
the
suggestion
from
your
majesty
i
thought
it
best
to
send
her
no
more
of
it
so
that
all
the
boxes
are
still
in
my
house
just
as
you
left
them
with
the
exception
of
one
which
disappeared
i
know
not
how
or
why
that
is
well
réné
said
catharine
perhaps
later
we
may
return
to
this
in
the
meantime
let
us
speak
of
the
other
matter
i
am
all
attention
madame
what
is
necessary
to
gain
an
idea
of
the
length
of
any
one
life
in
the
first
place
to
know
the
day
of
his
birth
his
age
and
under
what
condition
he
first
saw
light
and
then
to
have
some
of
his
blood
and
a
lock
of
his
hair
if
i
bring
you
some
of
his
blood
and
a
lock
of
his
hair
if
i
tell
you
the
circumstance
connected
with
his
birth
the
time
and
his
present
age
will
you
tell
me
the
probable
date
of
his
death
yes
to
within
a
few
days
very
well
i
have
a
lock
of
his
hair
and
will
get
some
of
his
blood
was
he
born
during
the
day
or
night
at
minutes
past
five
in
the
afternoon
be
at
my
room
at
five
the
experiment
must
be
made
at
the
hour
of
his
birth
very
well
said
catharine
will
be
there
réné
bowed
and
withdrew
without
apparently
noticing
the
will
be
there
which
however
contrary
to
her
usual
habit
indicated
that
catharine
would
not
go
alone
the
following
morning
at
dawn
catharine
went
to
her
son
apartments
at
midnight
she
had
sent
to
inquire
after
him
and
had
been
told
that
maître
ambroise
paré
was
with
him
ready
to
bleed
him
if
the
nervous
troubles
continued
still
starting
up
from
his
sleep
and
still
pale
from
loss
of
blood
charles
dozed
on
the
shoulder
of
his
faithful
nurse
who
leaning
against
the
bed
had
not
moved
for
three
hours
for
fear
of
waking
her
dear
child
a
slight
foam
appeared
from
time
to
time
on
the
lips
of
the
sick
man
and
the
nurse
wiped
it
off
with
a
fine
embroidered
linen
handkerchief
on
the
bed
lay
another
handkerchief
covered
with
great
spots
of
blood
for
an
instant
catharine
thought
she
would
take
possession
of
the
handkerchief
but
she
feared
that
this
blood
mixed
with
the
saliva
would
be
weak
and
would
not
be
efficacious
she
asked
the
nurse
if
the
doctor
had
bled
her
son
as
he
had
said
he
would
do
the
nurse
answered
yes
and
that
the
flow
of
blood
had
been
so
great
that
charles
had
fainted
twice
the
queen
mother
who
like
all
princesses
in
those
days
had
some
knowledge
of
medicine
asked
to
see
the
blood
nothing
was
easier
to
do
as
the
physician
had
ordered
that
the
blood
be
kept
in
order
that
he
might
examine
it
it
was
in
a
basin
in
an
adjoining
closet
catharine
went
in
to
look
at
it
poured
some
into
a
small
bottle
which
she
had
brought
for
this
purpose
and
then
came
back
hiding
in
her
pocket
her
fingers
the
tips
of
which
otherwise
would
have
betrayed
her
just
as
she
came
back
from
the
closet
charles
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
his
mother
then
remembering
as
in
a
dream
all
his
bitter
thoughts
ah
is
it
you
madame
said
he
well
say
to
your
well
loved
son
to
your
henry
of
anjou
that
it
shall
be
my
dear
charles
said
catharine
it
shall
be
just
when
you
please
be
quiet
now
and
go
to
sleep
as
if
yielding
to
this
advice
charles
closed
his
eyes
and
catharine
who
had
spoken
to
him
as
one
does
to
calm
a
sick
person
or
a
child
left
the
room
but
when
he
heard
the
door
close
charles
suddenly
sat
up
and
in
a
voice
still
weak
from
suffering
said
my
chancellor
the
seals
the
court
send
for
them
all
the
nurse
with
gentle
insistence
laid
the
head
of
the
king
back
on
her
shoulder
and
in
order
to
put
him
to
sleep
strove
to
rock
him
as
she
would
have
done
a
child
no
no
nurse
i
can
not
sleep
any
more
call
my
attendants
i
must
work
this
morning
when
charles
spoke
in
that
way
he
was
obeyed
and
even
the
nurse
in
spite
of
the
privileges
allowed
her
by
her
dared
not
disobey
she
sent
for
those
whom
the
king
wanted
and
the
council
was
planned
not
for
the
next
day
which
was
out
of
the
question
but
for
five
days
from
then
at
the
hour
agreed
on
that
is
at
five
the
queen
mother
and
the
duc
repaired
to
the
rooms
of
réné
who
expecting
their
visit
had
everything
ready
for
the
mysterious
seance
in
the
room
to
the
right
that
is
in
the
chamber
of
sacrifices
a
steel
blade
was
heating
over
a
glowing
brazier
from
its
fanciful
arabesques
this
blade
was
intended
to
represent
the
events
of
the
destiny
about
which
the
oracle
was
to
be
consulted
on
the
altar
lay
the
book
of
fate
and
during
the
night
which
had
been
very
clear
réné
had
studied
the
course
and
the
position
of
the
stars
henry
of
anjou
entered
first
he
wore
a
wig
a
mask
concealed
his
face
and
a
long
cloak
hid
his
figure
his
mother
followed
had
she
not
known
beforehand
that
the
man
who
had
preceded
her
was
her
son
she
never
would
have
recognized
him
catharine
removed
her
mask
the
duc
kept
his
on
did
you
make
any
observations
last
night
asked
catharine
yes
madame
said
réné
and
the
answer
of
the
stars
has
already
told
me
the
past
the
one
you
wish
to
know
about
like
every
one
born
under
the
sign
of
the
cancer
has
a
warm
heart
and
great
pride
he
is
powerful
he
has
lived
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
he
has
until
now
had
glory
and
wealth
is
this
so
madame
possibly
said
catharine
have
you
a
lock
of
his
hair
and
some
of
his
blood
yes
catharine
handed
to
the
necromancer
a
lock
of
fair
hair
and
a
small
bottle
filled
with
blood
réné
took
the
flask
shook
it
thoroughly
so
that
the
fibrine
and
water
would
mix
and
poured
a
large
drop
of
it
on
the
glowing
steel
the
living
liquid
boiled
for
an
instant
and
then
spread
out
into
fantastic
figures
oh
madame
cried
réné
i
see
him
twisting
in
awful
agony
hear
how
he
groans
how
he
calls
for
help
do
you
see
how
everything
around
him
becomes
blood
do
you
see
how
about
his
great
combats
are
taking
place
see
here
are
the
lances
and
look
there
are
the
swords
will
it
be
long
before
this
happens
asked
catharine
trembling
from
an
indescribable
emotion
and
laying
her
hand
on
that
of
henry
of
anjou
who
in
his
eager
curiosity
was
leaning
over
the
brazier
réné
approached
the
altar
and
repeated
a
cabalistic
prayer
putting
such
energy
and
conviction
into
the
act
that
the
veins
of
his
temples
swelled
and
caused
the
prophetic
convulsions
and
nervous
twinges
from
which
the
ancient
priestesses
suffered
before
their
tripods
and
even
on
their
at
length
he
rose
and
announced
that
everything
was
ready
took
the
flask
still
full
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
the
lock
of
hair
then
telling
catharine
to
open
the
book
at
random
and
to
read
the
first
words
she
looked
at
he
poured
the
rest
of
the
blood
on
the
steel
blade
and
threw
the
hair
into
the
brazier
pronouncing
a
cabalistic
sentence
composed
of
hebrew
words
which
he
himself
did
not
understand
instantly
the
duc
and
catharine
saw
a
white
figure
appear
on
the
sword
like
that
of
a
corpse
wrapped
in
his
shroud
another
figure
which
seemed
that
of
a
woman
was
leaning
over
the
first
at
the
same
time
the
hair
caught
fire
and
threw
out
a
single
flame
clear
swift
and
barbed
like
a
fiery
tongue
one
year
cried
réné
scarcely
one
year
and
this
man
shall
die
a
woman
alone
shall
weep
for
him
but
no
there
at
the
end
of
the
sword
is
another
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
catharine
looked
at
her
son
and
mother
though
she
was
seemed
to
ask
him
who
these
two
women
were
but
réné
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
before
the
steel
became
white
and
everything
gradually
disappeared
from
its
surface
then
catharine
opened
the
book
and
read
the
following
lines
in
a
voice
which
in
spite
of
her
effort
at
control
she
could
not
keep
from
shaking
a
peri
cil
que
redoutoit
tôt
trop
tôt
si
prudence
a
deep
silence
reigned
for
some
moments
for
the
one
whom
you
know
asked
catharine
what
are
the
signs
for
this
month
as
favorable
as
ever
madame
unless
providence
interferes
with
his
destiny
he
will
be
fortunate
and
yet
and
yet
what
one
of
the
stars
in
his
pleiad
was
covered
with
a
black
cloud
while
i
made
my
observations
ah
exclaimed
catharine
a
black
cloud
there
is
some
hope
then
of
whom
are
you
speaking
madame
asked
the
duc
catharine
drew
her
son
away
from
the
light
of
the
brazier
and
spoke
to
him
in
a
low
tone
meanwhile
réné
knelt
down
and
in
the
glow
of
the
flame
poured
into
his
hand
the
last
drop
of
blood
which
had
remained
in
the
bottom
of
the
flask
strange
contradiction
said
he
which
proves
how
little
to
be
depended
on
is
the
evidence
of
simple
science
practised
by
ordinary
men
to
any
one
but
myself
a
physician
a
scholar
even
for
maître
ambroise
paré
this
blood
would
seem
so
pure
so
healthy
so
full
of
life
and
animal
spirits
that
it
would
promise
long
years
of
life
and
yet
all
this
vigor
will
soon
disappear
all
this
life
will
be
extinct
within
a
year
catharine
and
henry
of
anjou
had
turned
round
and
were
listening
the
eyes
of
the
prince
glowed
through
his
mask
ah
continued
réné
the
present
alone
is
known
to
ordinary
mortals
while
to
us
the
past
and
the
future
are
known
so
continued
catharine
you
still
think
he
will
die
within
the
year
as
surely
as
we
are
three
living
persons
who
some
day
will
rest
in
our
coffins
yet
you
said
that
the
blood
was
pure
and
healthy
and
that
it
indicated
a
long
life
yes
if
things
followed
their
natural
course
but
might
not
an
accident
ah
yes
do
you
hear
said
catharine
to
henry
an
accident
alas
said
the
latter
all
the
more
reason
for
my
staying
oh
think
no
more
about
that
it
is
not
possible
then
turning
to
réné
thanks
said
the
young
man
disguising
his
voice
thanks
take
this
purse
come
said
catharine
intentionally
giving
her
son
this
title
to
throw
réné
off
the
track
they
left
oh
mother
you
see
said
henry
an
accident
and
if
an
accident
should
happen
i
shall
not
be
on
hand
i
shall
be
four
hundred
leagues
from
you
four
hundred
leagues
are
accomplished
in
eight
days
my
son
yes
but
how
do
i
know
whether
those
poles
will
let
me
come
back
if
i
could
only
wait
mother
who
knows
said
catharine
might
not
this
accident
of
which
réné
speaks
be
the
one
which
since
yesterday
has
laid
the
king
on
a
bed
of
pain
listen
return
by
yourself
my
child
i
shall
go
back
by
the
private
door
of
the
monastery
of
the
augustines
my
suite
is
waiting
for
me
in
this
convent
go
now
henry
go
and
keep
from
irritating
your
brother
in
case
you
see
him
chapter
xlii
confidences
the
first
thing
the
duc
heard
on
arriving
at
the
louvre
was
that
the
formal
reception
of
the
ambassadors
was
arranged
for
the
fifth
day
from
that
the
tailors
and
the
jewellers
were
waiting
for
the
prince
with
magnificent
clothes
and
superb
jewels
which
the
king
had
ordered
for
him
while
the
duke
tried
them
on
with
an
anger
which
brought
the
tears
to
his
eyes
henry
of
navarre
was
very
gay
in
a
magnificent
collar
of
emeralds
a
sword
with
a
gold
handle
and
a
precious
ring
which
charles
had
sent
him
that
morning
had
just
received
a
letter
and
had
shut
himself
up
in
his
own
room
to
read
it
as
to
coconnas
he
was
searching
every
corner
of
the
louvre
for
his
friend
in
fact
as
may
easily
be
imagined
he
had
been
somewhat
surprised
at
not
seeing
la
mole
return
that
night
and
by
morning
had
begun
to
feel
some
anxiety
consequently
he
had
started
out
to
find
his
friend
he
began
his
search
at
the
hôtel
de
la
belle
étoile
went
from
there
to
the
rue
cloche
percée
from
the
rue
cloche
percée
to
the
rue
tizon
from
there
to
the
pont
saint
michel
and
finally
from
the
pont
saint
michel
to
the
louvre
this
search
so
far
as
those
who
had
been
questioned
were
concerned
had
been
carried
on
in
a
way
so
original
and
exacting
which
may
easily
be
believed
when
one
realizes
the
eccentric
character
of
coconnas
that
it
had
caused
some
explanations
between
him
and
three
courtiers
these
explanations
had
ended
as
was
the
fashion
of
the
times
on
the
ground
in
these
encounters
coconnas
had
been
as
conscientious
as
he
usually
was
in
affairs
of
that
kind
and
had
killed
the
first
man
and
wounded
the
two
others
saying
poor
la
mole
he
knew
latin
so
well
the
last
victim
who
was
the
baron
de
boissey
said
as
he
fell
oh
for
the
love
of
heaven
coconnas
do
vary
a
little
and
at
least
say
that
he
knew
greek
at
last
the
report
of
the
adventure
in
the
corridor
leaked
out
coconnas
was
heartbroken
over
it
for
an
instant
he
thought
that
all
these
kings
and
princes
had
killed
his
friend
and
thrown
him
into
some
dungeon
he
learned
that
had
been
of
the
party
and
overlooking
the
majesty
which
surrounded
a
prince
of
the
blood
he
went
to
him
and
demanded
an
explanation
as
he
would
have
done
of
a
simple
gentleman
at
first
was
inclined
to
thrust
out
of
the
door
the
impertinent
fellow
who
came
and
asked
for
an
account
of
his
actions
but
coconnas
spoke
so
curtly
his
eyes
flashed
with
such
brightness
and
the
affair
of
the
three
duels
in
less
than
hours
had
raised
the
piedmontese
so
high
that
reflected
and
instead
of
yielding
to
his
first
inclination
he
answered
the
gentleman
with
a
charming
smile
my
dear
coconnas
it
is
true
that
the
king
was
furious
at
receiving
a
silver
bowl
on
his
shoulder
that
the
duc
was
vexed
at
being
hit
on
the
head
by
some
orange
marmalade
and
the
duc
de
guise
humiliated
at
having
the
breath
knocked
out
of
him
by
a
haunch
of
venison
and
so
they
were
all
determined
to
kill
monsieur
de
la
mole
but
a
friend
of
your
friend
turned
aside
the
blow
the
party
therefore
failed
in
their
attempt
i
give
you
my
word
as
prince
ah
said
coconnas
breathing
as
hard
as
a
pair
of
bellows
by
heaven
monseigneur
this
is
good
news
and
i
should
like
to
know
this
friend
to
show
him
my
gratitude
monsieur
made
no
reply
but
smiled
more
pleasantly
than
he
had
yet
done
implying
to
coconnas
that
this
friend
was
none
other
than
the
prince
himself
well
monseigneur
said
coconnas
since
you
have
gone
so
far
as
to
tell
me
the
beginning
of
the
story
crown
your
kindness
by
finishing
it
they
tried
to
kill
him
but
failed
you
say
well
what
happened
then
i
am
brave
and
can
bear
the
news
have
they
thrown
him
into
some
dungeon
so
much
the
better
it
will
make
him
more
careful
in
future
he
never
would
listen
to
my
advice
besides
we
can
get
him
out
by
heaven
stone
does
not
baffle
every
one
shook
his
head
the
worst
of
all
this
my
brave
coconnas
said
he
is
that
your
friend
disappeared
after
the
affair
and
no
one
knows
where
he
went
by
heaven
cried
the
piedmontese
again
growing
pale
had
he
gone
to
hell
i
should
at
least
have
known
where
he
is
listen
said
who
although
for
different
reasons
was
as
anxious
as
coconnas
to
know
la
mole
whereabouts
i
will
give
you
the
advice
of
a
friend
give
it
my
lord
said
coconnas
eagerly
go
to
queen
marguerite
she
must
know
what
has
become
of
the
friend
you
mourn
i
will
confess
to
your
highness
said
coconnas
that
i
had
thought
of
going
to
her
but
i
scarcely
dared
madame
marguerite
has
a
way
of
making
me
feel
somewhat
uncomfortable
at
times
and
besides
this
i
feared
that
i
might
find
her
in
tears
but
since
your
highness
assures
me
that
la
mole
is
not
dead
and
that
her
majesty
knows
where
he
is
i
will
take
heart
and
go
to
her
do
so
my
friend
said
françois
and
when
you
find
out
where
la
mole
is
let
me
know
for
really
i
am
as
anxious
as
you
are
but
remember
one
thing
coconnas
what
do
not
say
you
have
come
at
my
suggestion
for
if
you
do
you
will
learn
nothing
monseigneur
said
coconnas
since
your
highness
recommends
secrecy
on
this
point
i
shall
be
as
silent
as
a
tench
or
as
the
queen
mother
what
a
kind
good
generous
prince
he
is
murmured
coconnas
as
he
set
out
to
find
the
queen
of
navarre
marguerite
was
expecting
coconnas
for
the
report
of
his
despair
had
reached
her
and
on
hearing
by
what
exploits
his
grief
had
showed
itself
she
almost
forgave
him
for
his
somewhat
rude
treatment
of
her
friend
madame
la
duchesse
de
nevers
to
whom
he
had
not
spoken
for
two
or
three
days
owing
to
some
misunderstanding
between
them
therefore
as
soon
as
he
was
announced
to
the
queen
he
was
admitted
coconnas
entered
the
room
unable
to
overcome
the
constraint
which
he
had
mentioned
to
and
which
he
had
always
felt
in
the
presence
of
the
queen
it
was
caused
more
by
her
superior
intellect
than
by
her
rank
but
marguerite
received
him
with
a
smile
which
at
once
put
him
at
his
ease
ah
madame
said
he
give
me
back
my
friend
i
beg
you
or
at
least
tell
me
what
has
become
of
him
for
without
him
i
can
not
live
imagine
euryalus
without
nisus
damon
without
pythias
or
orestes
without
pylades
and
pity
my
grief
for
the
sake
of
one
of
the
heroes
i
have
just
mentioned
whose
heart
i
swear
was
no
more
tender
than
mine
marguerite
smiled
and
having
made
coconnas
promise
not
to
reveal
the
secret
she
told
him
of
la
mole
escape
from
the
window
as
to
his
insistent
as
were
the
prayers
of
the
piedmontese
she
preserved
the
strictest
silence
this
only
half
satisfied
coconnas
so
he
resorted
to
diplomatic
speeches
of
the
highest
order
the
result
was
that
marguerite
saw
clearly
that
the
duc
was
partly
the
cause
of
the
courtier
great
desire
to
know
what
had
become
of
la
mole
well
said
the
queen
if
you
must
know
something
definite
about
your
friend
ask
king
henry
of
navarre
he
alone
has
the
right
to
speak
as
to
me
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
the
friend
for
whom
you
are
searching
is
alive
and
you
may
believe
what
i
say
i
believe
one
thing
still

madame
replied
coconnas
that
is
that
your
beautiful
eyes
have
not
wept
thereupon
thinking
that
there
was
nothing
to
add
to
a
remark
which
had
the
double
advantage
of
expressing
his
thought
as
well
as
the
high
opinion
he
had
of
la
mole
coconnas
withdrew
pondering
on
a
reconciliation
with
madame
de
nevers
not
on
her
account
but
in
order
that
he
might
find
out
from
her
what
he
had
been
unable
to
learn
from
marguerite
deep
griefs
are
abnormal
conditions
in
which
the
mind
shakes
off
the
yoke
as
soon
as
possible
the
thought
of
leaving
marguerite
had
at
first
broken
la
mole
heart
and
it
was
in
order
to
save
the
reputation
of
the
queen
rather
than
to
preserve
his
own
life
that
he
had
consented
to
run
away
therefore
the
following
evening
he
returned
to
paris
to
see
marguerite
from
her
balcony
as
if
instinct
told
her
of
the
young
man
plan
the
queen
spent
the
whole
evening
at
her
window
the
result
was
that
the
lovers
met
again
with
the
indescribable
delight
which
accompanies
forbidden
pleasures
more
than
this
the
melancholy
and
romantic
temperament
of
la
mole
found
a
certain
charm
in
the
situation
but
a
man
really
in
love
is
happy
only
for
the
time
being
while
he
sees
or
is
with
the
woman
he
loves
after
he
has
left
her
he
suffers
anxious
to
see
marguerite
again
la
mole
set
himself
busily
to
work
to
bring
about
the
event
which
would
make
it
possible
for
him
to
be
with
her
namely
the
flight
of
the
king
of
navarre
marguerite
on
her
part
willingly
gave
herself
up
to
the
happiness
of
being
loved
with
so
pure
a
devotion
often
she
was
angry
with
herself
for
what
she
regarded
as
a
weakness
her
strong
mind
despised
the
poverty
of
ordinary
love
insensible
to
the
details
which
for
tender
souls
make
it
the
sweetest
the
most
delicate
and
the
most
desirable
of
all
pleasures
so
she
felt
that
the
days
if
not
happily
filled
were
at
least
happily
ended
when
at
about
nine
every
evening
she
stepped
out
on
her
balcony
in
a
white
she
perceived
in
the
darkness
of
the
quay
a
horseman
whose
hand
was
raised
first
to
his
lips
then
to
his
heart
then
a
significant
cough
reminded
the
lover
of
a
cherished
voice
sometimes
a
note
was
thrown
by
a
little
hand
and
in
the
note
was
hidden
some
costly
jewel
precious
not
on
account
of
its
value
but
because
it
had
belonged
to
her
who
threw
it
and
this
would
fall
on
the
pavement
a
few
feet
from
the
young
man
then
la
mole
would
swoop
down
on
it
like
a
kite
press
it
to
his
heart
answer
in
the
same
voice
while
marguerite
stood
at
her
balcony
until
the
sound
of
the
horse
hoofs
had
died
away
in
the
darkness
the
steed
ridden
at
full
speed
when
coming
on
leaving
seemed
as
if
made
of
material
as
lifeless
as
that
of
the
famous
horse
which
lost
troy
this
was
why
the
queen
was
not
anxious
as
to
the
fate
of
la
mole
but
fearing
that
he
might
be
watched
and
followed
she
persistently
refused
all
interviews
except
these
clandestine
ones
which
began
immediately
after
la
mole
flight
and
continued
every
evening
until
the
time
set
for
the
formal
reception
of
the
ambassadors
a
reception
which
by
the
express
orders
of
ambroise
paré
as
we
have
seen
was
postponed
for
several
days
the
evening
before
this
reception
at
about
nine
when
every
one
in
the
louvre
was
engaged
in
preparations
for
the
following
day
marguerite
opened
her
window
and
stepped
out
upon
her
balcony
as
she
did
so
without
waiting
for
her
note
la
mole
in
greater
haste
than
usual
threw
his
note
which
with
his
usual
skill
fell
at
the
feet
of
his
royal
mistress
marguerite
realized
that
the
missive
contained
something
special
and
retired
from
the
balcony
to
read
it
the
note
consisted
of
two
separate
sheets
on
the
first
page
were
these
words
i
must
speak
to
the
king
of
navarre
the
matter
is
urgent
i
will
on
the
second
page
were
these
words
lady
and
my
queen
arrange
so
that
i
may
give
you
one
of
the
kisses
i
now
send
you
i
will
marguerite
had
scarcely
finished
the
second
part
of
the
letter
when
she
heard
the
voice
of
henry
of
navarre
who
with
his
usual
caution
had
knocked
on
the
outer
door
and
was
asking
gillonne
if
he
might
enter
the
queen
at
once
separated
the
letter
put
one
of
the
sheets
in
her
robe
the
other
in
her
pocket
hurriedly
closed
the
window
and
stepped
to
the
door
enter
sire
said
she
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
marguerite
had
been
careful
to
close
the
window
quickly
and
gently
the
sound
had
reached
henry
whose
acute
senses
in
the
midst
of
people
he
greatly
mistrusted
had
almost
acquired
the
exquisite
delicacy
they
attain
in
the
savage
but
the
king
of
navarre
was
not
one
of
those
tyrants
who
forbid
their
wives
from
taking
the
air
and
watching
the
stars
henry
was
as
gracious
and
smiling
as
ever
madame
said
he
while
every
one
is
rehearsing
the
coming
ceremonial
i
thought
i
would
come
and
have
a
little
talk
with
you
about
my
affairs
which
you
still
regard
as
yours
do
you
not
certainly
monsieur
replied
marguerite
are
not
our
interests
one
and
the
same
yes
madame
and
that
is
why
i
wanted
to
ask
what
you
thought
about
monsieur
le
duc
avoiding
me
so
for
the
last
few
days
the
day
before
yesterday
he
even
went
to
saint
germain
does
it
not
mean
either
that
he
is
planning
to
leave
by
himself
for
he
is
watched
very
little
or
that
he
is
not
going
to
leave
at
all
give
me
your
opinion
madame
if
you
please
i
confess
it
will
be
a
great
relief
to
me
to
tell
you
mine
your
majesty
is
right
in
being
anxious
at
my
brother
silence
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
all
day
and
my
idea
is
that
as
circumstances
have
changed
he
has
changed
with
them
you
mean
do
you
not
that
seeing
king
charles
ill
and
the
duc
king
of
poland
he
would
not
be
averse
to
staying
in
paris
to
keep
watch
over
the
crown
of
france
exactly
be
it
so
i
ask
nothing
better
than
for
him
to
remain
said
henry
only
that
will
change
our
entire
plan
to
leave
without
him
i
shall
need
three
times
the
guarantees
i
should
have
asked
for
had
i
gone
with
your
brother
whose
name
and
presence
in
the
enterprise
would
have
been
my
safeguard
but
what
surprises
me
is
that
i
have
not
heard
from
monsieur
de
mouy
it
is
not
like
him
to
stay
away
so
long
have
you
had
any
news
of
him
madame
i
sire
exclaimed
marguerite
in
astonishment
why
how
could
you
expect
why
by
heaven
my
dear
nothing
would
be
more
natural
in
order
to
please
me
you
were
kind
enough
to
save
the
life
of
young
la
mole
he
must
have
reached
nantes
and
if
one
can
get
to
a
place
he
can
easily
get
away
from
it
ah
this
explains
an
enigma
the
answer
to
which
i
could
not
make
out
said
marguerite
i
had
left
my
window
open
and
found
on
coming
back
to
my
room
a
note
on
my
floor
there
now
said
henry
a
note
which
at
first
i
could
not
understand
and
to
which
i
attached
no
importance
whatsoever
continued
marguerite
perhaps
i
was
wrong
and
that
it
comes
from
that
quarter
that
is
possible
said
henry
i
might
even
say
probable
might
i
see
this
note
certainly
sire
replied
marguerite
handing
to
the
king
the
missive
she
had
put
into
her
pocket
the
king
glanced
at
it
is
it
not
monsieur
de
la
mole
handwriting
said
he
i
do
not
know
replied
marguerite
it
looks
to
me
like
a
counterfeit
no
matter
let
us
read
it
and
he
read
i
must
speak
to
the
king
of
navarre
the
matter
is
urgent
i
will
so
said
henry
you
see
he
says
he
will
wait
certainly
i
see
that
said
marguerite
but
what
would
you
expect
why
saint
gris
i
expect
that
he
is
waiting
that
he
is
waiting
cried
marguerite
looking
at
her
husband
in
astonishment
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
sire
a
man
whom
the
king
tried
to
kill
a
man
who
is
watched
threatened
waiting
you
say
would
that
be
possible
are
the
doors
made
for
those
who
have
been
obliged
to
escape
by
the
window
you
were
going
to
say
yes
you
have
finished
my
sentence
well
but
if
they
know
the
way
by
the
window
let
them
take
it
since
it
is
perfectly
impossible
for
them
to
enter
by
the
door
it
is
very
simple
do
you
think
so
said
marguerite
flushing
with
pleasure
at
the
thought
of
again
being
near
la
mole
i
am
sure
of
it
but
how
could
one
reach
the
window
asked
the
queen
did
you
not
keep
the
rope
ladder
i
sent
you
where
is
your
usual
foresight
yes
sire
i
kept
it
said
marguerite
in
that
case
there
will
be
no
difficulty
said
henry
what
does
your
majesty
wish
why
it
is
very
simple
said
henry
fasten
it
to
your
balcony
and
let
it
hang
down
if
it
is
de
mouy
who
is
waiting
and
he
wants
to
mount
it
he
will
do
so
without
losing
his
gravity
henry
took
the
candle
to
aid
marguerite
in
her
search
for
the
ladder
they
did
not
have
to
look
long
it
was
in
a
wardrobe
in
the
famous
closet
there
it
is
said
henry
now
madame
if
i
am
not
asking
too
much
fasten
it
to
the
balcony
i
beg
you
why
should
i
fasten
it
and
not
you
sire
said
marguerite
because
the
best
conspirators
are
the
most
careful
seeing
a
man
might
perhaps
frighten
away
our
friend
you
see
marguerite
smiled
and
tied
the
ladder
there
said
henry
concealing
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
room
stand
so
he
can
see
you
now
drop
the
ladder
good
i
am
sure
that
de
mouy
will
climb
up
in
fact
about
ten
minutes
later
a
man
mad
with
joy
stepped
over
the
balcony
but
seeing
that
the
queen
did
not
come
to
him
he
hesitated
a
moment
instead
of
marguerite
it
was
henry
who
stepped
forward
ah
said
he
graciously
it
is
not
de
mouy
but
monsieur
de
la
mole
good
evening
monsieur
de
la
mole
come
in
i
beg
you
la
mole
paused
a
moment
overwhelmed
had
he
still
been
on
the
ladder
instead
of
on
the
balcony
he
might
possibly
have
fallen
backward
you
wanted
to
speak
to
the
king
of
navarre
on
matters
of
importance
said
marguerite
i
have
told
him
so
and
here
he
is
henry
closed
the
window
i
love
you
said
marguerite
hastily
pressing
the
young
man
hand
well
monsieur
said
henry
placing
a
chair
for
la
mole
what
is
it
this
sire
replied
la
mole
i
have
left
monsieur
de
mouy
at
the
city
gates
he
desires
to
know
if
maurevel
has
spoken
and
if
his
presence
in
your
majesty
room
is
known
not
yet
but
it
will
be
before
long
so
we
must
make
haste
that
is
my
opinion
sire
and
if
evening
monsieur
is
ready
to
start
de
mouy
will
be
at
the
porte
saint
marcel
with
five
hundred
men
these
will
take
you
to
fontainebleau
then
you
can
easily
reach
blois
angoulême
and
bordeaux
madame
said
henry
turning
to
his
wife
i
can
be
ready
by
can
you
la
mole
eyes
were
anxiously
fixed
on
those
of
marguerite
you
have
my
promise
said
the
queen
wherever
you
go
i
will
follow
but
you
know
monsieur
must
leave
at
the
same
time
no
half
way
with
him
either
he
serves
us
or
he
betrays
us
if
he
hesitates
we
do
not
stir
does
he
know
anything
of
this
plan
monsieur
de
la
mole
asked
henry
he
should
have
received
a
letter
from
monsieur
de
mouy
several
days
ago
why
said
henry
he
said
nothing
to
me
about
it
be
careful
monsieur
said
marguerite
be
careful
i
shall
be
on
my
guard
you
may
be
sure
how
can
we
get
an
answer
to
de
mouy
do
not
worry
sire
on
the
right
on
the
left
of
your
majesty
visible
or
invisible
he
will
be
on
hand
during
the
reception
of
the
ambassadors
one
word
in
the
address
of
the
queen
will
suffice
for
him
to
understand
whether
you
consent
or
not
whether
he
must
leave
or
wait
for
you
if
the
duc
refuses
he
asks
but
a
fortnight
to
reorganize
everything
in
your
name
really
said
henry
de
mouy
is
invaluable
can
you
insert
the
necessary
words
in
your
address
madame
nothing
will
be
easier
replied
marguerite
then
i
will
see
monsieur
said
henry
let
de
mouy
be
at
his
post
ready
to
understand
at
a
word
he
will
be
there
sire
and
monsieur
de
la
mole
said
henry
take
my
answer
to
him

probably
have
a
horse
or
a
servant
near
by
orthon
is
waiting
for
me
at
the
quay
go
back
to
him
monsieur
oh
no
not
by
the
window
which
is
good
only
for
an
emergency
you
might
be
seen
and
as
it
would
not
be
known
that
you
had
taken
this
risk
for
me
it
might
compromise
the
queen
how
shall
i
leave
sire
although
you
may
not
be
able
to
enter
the
louvre
by
yourself
you
can
at
least
leave
it
with
me
for
i
have
the
password
you
have
your
cloak
i
have
mine
we
will
put
them
on
and
can
pass
the
gate
without
difficulty
besides
i
shall
be
glad
to
give
some
special
orders
to
orthon
wait
here
while
i
go
and
see
if
there
is
any
one
in
the
corridor
with
the
most
natural
air
possible
henry
went
out
to
investigate
la
mole
was
left
alone
with
the
queen
ah
when

i
see
you
again
said
he
evening
if

evening

the
rue

henry

respectfully
to
the
queen
give
him
your
hand
to
kiss
madame
said
henry
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
no
ordinary
servitor
marguerite
obeyed
by
the
way
said
henry
be
sure
and
keep
the
rope
ladder
it
is
a
valuable
instrument
for
conspirators
and
when
we
least
expect
it
we
may
need
it
come
monsieur

chapter
xliii
the
ambassadors
the
following
day
the
entire
population
of
paris
rushed
towards
the
faubourg
saint
antoine
by
which
it
had
been
decided
that
the
polish
ambassadors
were
to
enter
a
line
of
swiss
restrained
the
crowd
and
a
regiment
of
horse
protected
the
lords
and
the
ladies
of
the
court
who
rode
ahead
of
the
procession
soon
near
the
abbey
saint
antoine
a
troop
of
cavaliers
appeared
dressed
in
red
and
yellow
with
caps
and
furred
mantles
and
carrying
long
curved
sabres
like
turkish
cimeters
the
officers
rode
at
the
side
of
the
lines
behind
this
troop
came
a
second
clothed
with
oriental
magnificence
they
preceded
the
ambassadors
who
four
in
number
represented
in
a
gorgeous
manner
the
most
mythological
of
the
chivalrous
kingdoms
of
the
sixteenth
century
one
of
the
ambassadors
was
the
bishop
of
cracow
his
costume
was
half
ecclesiastical
half
military
resplendent
with
gold
and
precious
stones
his
white
horse
with
long
mane
and
tail
walked
with
proud
step
and
seemed
to
breathe
out
fire
from
his
nostrils
no
one
would
have
supposed
that
for
a
month
the
noble
animal
had
made
fifteen
leagues
daily
over
roads
which
the
weather
had
rendered
almost
impassable
beside
the
bishop
rode
the
palatine
lasco
a
powerful
noble
closely
related
to
the
royal
family
as
rich
as
a
king
and
as
proud
behind
these
two
chief
ambassadors
who
were
accompanied
by
two
other
palatines
of
high
rank
came
a
number
of
polish
lords
whose
horses
in
their
harness
of
silk
studded
with
gold
and
precious
stones
excited
the
applause
of
the
people
the
french
horsemen
in
spite
of
their
rich
apparel
were
completely
eclipsed
by
the
newcomers
whom
they
scornfully
called
barbarians
up
to
the
last
moment
catharine
had
hoped
the
reception
would
be
postponed
on
account
of
the
king
illness
but
when
the
day
came
and
she
saw
charles
as
pale
as
a
corpse
put
on
the
gorgeous
royal
mantle
she
realized
that
apparently
at
least
she
must
yield
to
his
iron
will
and
began
to
believe
that
after
all
the
safest
plan
for
henry
of
anjou
was
to
accept
the
magnificent
exile
to
which
he
was
condemned
with
the
exception
of
the
few
words
he
had
uttered
when
he
opened
his
eyes
as
his
mother
came
out
of
the
closet
charles
had
not
spoken
to
catharine
since
the
scene
which
had
brought
about
the
illness
to
which
he
had
succumbed
every
one
in
the
louvre
knew
that
there
had
been
a
dreadful
altercation
between
mother
and
son
but
no
one
knew
the
cause
of
it
and
the
boldest
trembled
before
that
coldness
and
silence
as
birds
tremble
before
the
calm
which
precedes
a
storm
everything
had
been
prepared
in
the
louvre
not
as
though
there
were
to
be
a
reception
but
as
if
some
funeral
ceremony
were
to
occur
every
one
had
obeyed
orders
in
a
gloomy
or
passive
manner
it
was
known
that
catharine
had
almost
trembled
and
consequently
every
one
else
trembled
the
large
of
the
palace
had
been
prepared
and
as
such
ceremonies
were
usually
public
the
guards
and
the
sentinels
had
received
orders
to
admit
with
the
ambassadors
as
many
people
as
the
apartments
and
the
courts
would
hold
as
for
paris
it
presented
the
same
aspect
that
every
large
city
presents
under
similar
circumstances
that
is
confusion
and
curiosity
but
had
any
one
looked
closely
at
the
population
that
day
he
would
have
noticed
among
the
groups
of
honest
bourgeois
with
smiling
faces
a
considerable
number
of
men
in
long
cloaks
who
exchanged
glances
and
signs
when
at
a
distance
and
when
they
met
a
few
rapid
words
in
a
low
tone
these
men
seemed
greatly
occupied
with
the
procession
followed
it
closely
and
appeared
to
receive
their
orders
from
an
old
man
whose
sharp
black
eyes
in
spite
of
his
white
beard
and
grayish
eyebrows
showed
a
vigorous
activity
this
old
man
either
by
his
own
efforts
or
by
those
of
his
companions
was
among
the
first
to
gain
admission
to
the
louvre
and
thanks
to
the
kindness
of
the
swiss
guard
succeeded
in
finding
a
place
behind
the
ambassadors
opposite
marguerite
and
henry
of
navarre
henry
informed
by
la
mole
that
de
mouy
would
be
present
in
some
disguise
or
other
looked
round
on
all
sides
at
last
his
eyes
encountered
those
of
the
old
man
and
held
them
a
sign
from
de
mouy
had
dispelled
all
doubt
he
was
so
changed
that
henry
himself
was
doubtful
whether
this
old
man
with
the
white
beard
could
be
the
intrepid
huguenot
chief
who
five
or
six
days
before
had
made
so
desperate
a
defence
a
word
from
henry
whispered
into
marguerite
ear
called
the
attention
of
the
queen
to
de
mouy
then
her
beautiful
eyes
wandered
around
the
great
hall
in
search
of
la
mole
but
in
vain
la
mole
was
not
there
the
speeches
began
the
first
was
to
the
king
lasco
in
the
name
of
the
diet
asked
him
to
consent
that
the
crown
of
poland
be
offered
to
a
prince
of
the
house
of
france
charles
reply
was
short
and
to
the
point
he
presented
his
brother
the
duc
whose
courage
he
praised
highly
to
the
polish
ambassadors
he
spoke
in
french
and
an
interpreter
translated
his
reply
at
the
end
of
each
sentence
while
the
interpreter
was
speaking
the
king
was
seen
applying
a
handkerchief
to
his
lips
and
each
time
he
removed
it
it
was
covered
with
blood
when
charles
reply
was
finished
lasco
turned
to
the
duc
bowed
and
began
a
latin
address
in
which
he
offered
him
the
throne
in
the
name
of
the
polish
nation
the
duke
replied
in
the
same
language
and
in
a
voice
he
strove
in
vain
to
render
firm
that
he
accepted
with
gratitude
the
honor
which
was
offered
to
him
while
he
spoke
charles
remained
standing
with
lips
compressed
and
fixed
on
him
eyes
as
calm
and
threatening
as
those
of
an
eagle
when
the
duke
had
finished
lasco
took
the
crown
of
the
jagellos
from
the
red
velvet
cushion
on
which
it
rested
and
while
two
polish
nobles
placed
the
royal
mantle
on
the
duke
he
laid
the
crown
in
hands
charles
signed
to
his
brother
the
duc
knelt
down
before
him
and
with
his
own
hand
the
king
placed
the
crown
on
his
brother
head
then
the
two
kings
exchanged
one
of
the
most
bitter
kisses
ever
exchanged
between
two
brothers
at
once
a
herald
cried
alexander
edward
henry
of
france
duc
is
crowned
king
of
poland
long
live
the
king
of
poland
the
entire
assembly
repeated
the
cry
long
live
the
king
of
poland
then
lasco
turned
to
marguerite
the
discourse
of
the
beautiful
queen
had
been
reserved
for
the
last
now
as
it
was
a
compliment
accorded
her
in
order
to
display
her
brilliant
talents
as
they
were
called
every
one
paid
great
attention
to
the
reply
which
was
in
latin
and
which
as
we
have
said
marguerite
had
composed
herself
lascos
address
was
more
of
a
eulogy
than
an
address
he
had
yielded
sarmatian
that
he
was
to
the
admiration
which
the
beautiful
queen
of
navarre
inspired
in
every
one
he
had
borrowed
his
language
from
ovid
his
style
was
that
of
ronsard
he
said
that
having
left
varsovia
in
the
middle
of
a
very
dark
night
neither
he
nor
his
companions
would
have
been
able
to
find
their
way
had
they
not
like
the
magi
been
guided
by
two
stars
which
became
more
and
more
brilliant
as
they
drew
nearer
to
france
and
which
now
they
recognized
as
the
two
beautiful
eyes
of
the
queen
of
navarre
finally
passing
from
the
gospel
to
the
koran
from
syria
to
arabia
from
nazareth
to
mecca
he
concluded
by
saying
that
he
was
quite
prepared
to
do
what
the
ardent
votaries
of
the
prophet
did
when
they
were
fortunate
enough
to
see
his
tomb
they
put
out
their
eyes
feeling
that
after
they
had
looked
at
such
a
sight
nothing
in
the
world
was
worth
being
admired
this
address
was
loudly
applauded
by
those
who
understood
latin
because
they
were
of
the
same
opinion
as
the
orator
and
by
those
who
did
not
understand
it
because
they
wished
to
appear
as
though
they
did
marguerite
made
a
gracious
courtesy
to
the
gallant
sarmatian
then
fixing
her
eyes
on
de
mouy
began
her
reply
in
these
words
nunc
hac
in
aulâ
insperati
adestis
exultaremus
ego
et
conjux
nisi
ideo
immineret
calamitas
scilicet
non
solum
fratris
sed
etiam
amici
these
words
had
a
double
meaning
and
while
intended
for
de
mouy
were
apparently
addressed
to
henry
of
anjou
the
latter
therefore
bowed
in
token
of
gratitude
charles
did
not
remember
having
read
this
sentence
in
the
address
which
had
been
submitted
to
him
some
days
before
but
he
attached
no
importance
to
marguerite
words
which
he
knew
were
merely
conventional
besides
he
understood
latin
very
imperfectly
marguerite
continued
dolemur
a
te
dividi
ut
tecum
proficisci
maluissemus
sed
idem
fatum
quo
nunc
sine
ullâ
morâ
lutetiâ
cedere
juberis

in
urbe
detinet
proficiscere
ergo
frater
proficiscere
amice
proficiscere
sine
nobis
proficiscentem
sequuntur
spes
et
desideria
it
may
easily
be
imagined
that
de
mouy
listened
with
the
closest
attention
to
these
words
which
although
addressed
to
the
ambassadors
were
intended
for
him
alone
two
or
three
times
henry
had
glanced
indifferently
over
his
shoulder
to
intimate
to
the
young
huguenot
that
had
refused
but
the
act
which
appeared
involuntary
would
have
been
insufficient
for
de
mouy
had
not
marguerite
words
confirmed
it
while
looking
at
marguerite
and
listening
with
his
whole
soul
his
piercing
black
eyes
beneath
their
gray
brows
struck
catharine
who
started
as
if
she
had
had
a
shock
of
electricity
and
who
did
not
remove
her
eyes
from
him
what
a
strange
face
thought
she
continuing
to
change
her
expression
according
as
the
ceremony
required
it
who
is
this
man
who
watches
marguerite
so
attentively
and
whom
marguerite
and
henry
on
their
part
look
at
so
earnestly
the
queen
of
navarre
went
on
with
her
address
which
from
that
point
was
a
reply
to
the
courtesies
of
the
polish
ambassador
while
catharine
was
racking
her
brain
to
discover
the
name
of
this
fine
old
man
the
master
of
ceremonies
came
up
behind
her
and
handed
her
a
perfumed
satin
bag
containing
a
folded
paper
she
opened
the
bag
drew
out
the
paper
and
read
these
words
the
aid
of
a
cordial
which
i
have
just
administered
to
him
maurevel
has
somewhat
recovered
his
strength
and
has
succeeded
in
writing
the
name
of
the
man
who
was
in
the
apartment
of
the
king
of
navarre
this
man
was
monsieur
de
de
mouy
thought
the
queen
well
i
felt
it
was
he
but
this
old
man
ah
this
old
man
is
she
leaned
toward
the
captain
of
the
guard
look
monsieur
de
nancey
said
she
but
without
attracting
attention
look
at
lasco
who
is
speaking
behind
him
do
you
see
the
old
man
with
the
white
beard
in
the
black
velvet
suit
yes
madame
replied
the
captain
well
do
not
lose
sight
of
him
the
one
to
whom
the
king
of
navarre
made
a
sign
just
now
exactly
station
yourself
at
the
door
of
the
louvre
with
ten
men
and
when
he
comes
out
invite
him
in
the
king
name
to
dinner
if
he
accepts
take
him
into
some
room
in
which
you
must
keep
him
a
prisoner
if
he
resists
seize
him
dead
or
alive
fortunately
henry
who
had
been
paying
but
little
attention
to
marguerite
address
was
looking
at
catharine
and
had
not
lost
a
single
expression
of
her
face
seeing
the
eyes
of
the
queen
mother
fixed
so
earnestly
on
de
mouy
he
grew
uneasy
when
he
saw
her
give
an
order
to
the
captain
of
the
guard
he
comprehended
everything
it
was
at
this
moment
that
he
made
the
sign
which
had
surprised
monsieur
de
nancey
and
which
meant
you
are
discovered
save
yourself
de
mouy
understood
this
gesture
which
was
a
fitting
climax
to
the
portion
of
marguerite
address
intended
for
him
he
did
not
delay
an
instant
but
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
disappeared
henry
however
was
not
easy
until
monsieur
de
nancey
had
returned
to
catharine
and
he
saw
from
the
frown
on
the
queen
mother
face
that
the
captain
had
not
been
in
time
the
audience
was
over
marguerite
exchanged
a
few
unofficial
words
with
lasco
the
king
staggered
to
his
feet
bowed
and
went
out
leaning
on
the
arm
of
ambroise
paré
who
had
not
left
him
since
his
illness
catharine
pale
with
anger
and
henry
silent
from
disappointment
followed
as
to
the
duc
he
had
scarcely
been
noticed
during
the
ceremony
and
not
once
had
charles
whose
eyes
had
not
left
the
duc
glanced
at
him
the
new
king
of
poland
felt
himself
lost
far
from
his
mother
carried
away
by
those
barbarians
of
the
north
he
was
like
antæus
the
son
of
terra
who
lost
his
strength
when
lifted
in
the
arms
of
hercules
once
beyond
the
frontier
the
duc
felt
that
he
was
forever
excluded
from
the
throne
of
france
instead
of
following
the
king
he
retired
to
his
mother
apartments
he
found
her
no
less
gloomy
and
preoccupied
than
himself
for
she
was
thinking
of
that
fine
mocking
face
she
had
not
lost
sight
of
during
the
ceremony
of
the
béarnais
for
whom
destiny
had
seemed
to
make
way
sweeping
aside
kings
royal
assassins
enemies
and
obstacles
seeing
her
beloved
son
pale
beneath
his
crown
and
bent
under
his
royal
mantle
clasping
his
beautiful
hands
in
silence
and
holding
them
out
to
her
piteously
catharine
rose
and
went
to
him
oh
mother
cried
the
king
of
poland
i
am
condemned
to
die
in
exile
my
son
said
catharine
have
you
so
soon
forgotten
réné
prediction
do
not
worry
you
will
not
have
to
stay
there
long
mother
i
entreat
you
said
the
duc
if
there
is
the
slightest
hint
or
the
least
suspicion
that
the
throne
of
france
is
to
be
vacant
send
me
word
do
not
worry
my
son
said
catharine
until
the
day
for
which
both
of
us
are
waiting
there
shall
always
be
a
horse
saddled
in
my
stable
and
in
my
antechamber

ready
to
set

henry
of
anjou
having
departed
peace
and
happiness
seemed
to
have
returned
to
the
louvre
among
this
family
of
the
atrides
charles
forgetting
his
melancholy
recovered
his
vigorous
health
hunting
with
henry
and
on
days
when
this
was
not
possible
discussing
hunting
affairs
with
him
and
reproaching
him
for
only
one
thing
his
indifference
to
hawking
declaring
that
he
would
be
faultless
if
he
knew
how
to
snare
falcons
gerfalcons
and
hawks
as
well
as
he
knew
how
to
hunt
brocks
and
hounds
catharine
had
become
a
good
mother
again
gentle
to
charles
and
affectionate
to
henry
and
marguerite
gracious
to
madame
de
nevers
and
madame
de
sauve
and
under
the
pretext
that
it
was
in
obedience
to
an
order
from
her
that
he
had
been
wounded
she
carried
her
amiabilities
so
far
as
to
visit
maurevel
twice
during
his
convalescence
in
his
house
in
the
rue
de
la
cerisaie
marguerite
continued
to
carry
on
her
love
affair
after
the
spanish
fashion
every
evening
she
opened
her
window
and
by
gestures
and
notes
kept
up
her
correspondence
with
la
mole
while
in
each
of
his
letters
the
young
man
reminded
his
lovely
queen
of
her
promise
of
a
few
moments
in
the
rue
cloche
percée
as
a
reward
for
his
exile
only
one
person
was
lonely
and
unhappy
in
the
now
calm
and
peaceful
louvre
this
was
our
friend
count
annibal
de
coconnas
it
was
certainly
something
to
know
that
la
mole
was
alive
it
was
much
to
be
the
favorite
of
madame
de
nevers
the
most
charming
and
the
most
whimsical
of
women
but
all
the
pleasure
of
a
meeting
granted
him
by
the
beautiful
duchess
all
the
consolation
offered
by
marguerite
as
to
the
fate
of
their
common
friend
did
not
compensate
in
the
eyes
of
the
piedmontese
for
one
hour
spent
with
la
mole
at
their
friend
la
before
a
bottle
of
light
wine
or
for
one
of
those
midnight
rambles
through
that
part
of
paris
in
which
an
honest
man
ran
the
risk
of
receiving
rents
in
his
flesh
his
purse
or
his
clothes
to
the
shame
of
humanity
it
must
be
said
that
madame
de
nevers
bore
with
impatience
her
rivalry
with
la
mole
it
was
not
that
she
hated
the
provincial
on
the
contrary
carried
away
by
the
irresistible
instinct
which
in
spite
of
herself
makes
every
woman
a
coquette
with
another
woman
lover
especially
when
that
woman
is
her
friend
she
had
not
spared
la
mole
the
flashes
of
her
emerald
eyes
and
coconnas
might
have
envied
the
frank
handclasps
and
the
amiable
acts
done
by
the
duchess
in
favor
of
his
friend
during
those
days
in
which
the
star
of
the
piedmontese
seemed
growing
dim
in
the
sky
of
his
beautiful
mistress
but
coconnas
who
would
have
strangled
fifteen
persons
for
a
single
glance
from
his
lady
was
so
little
jealous
of
la
mole
that
he
had
often
after
some
indiscretions
of
the
duchess
whispered
certain
offers
which
had
made
the
man
from
the
provinces
blush
at
this
stage
of
affairs
it
happened
that
henriette
who
by
the
absence
of
la
mole
was
deprived
of
all
the
enjoyment
she
had
had
from
the
company
of
coconnas
that
is
his
flow
of
spirits
and
fun
came
to
marguerite
one
day
to
beg
her
to
do
her
this
favor
without
which
the
heart
and
the
mind
of
coconnas
seemed
to
be
slipping
away
day
by
day
marguerite
always
sympathetic
and
besides
influenced
by
the
prayers
of
la
mole
and
the
wishes
of
her
own
heart
arranged
a
meeting
with
henriette
for
the
next
day
in
the
house
with
the
double
entrance
in
order
to
discuss
these
matters
thoroughly
and
uninterruptedly
coconnas
received
with
rather
bad
grace
the
note
from
henriette
asking
him
to
be
in
the
rue
tizon
at
nine
nevertheless
he
went
to
the
place
appointed
where
he
found
henriette
who
was
provoked
at
having
arrived
first
fie
monsieur
she
cried
it
is
very
bad
to
make
i
will
not
say
a
princess
but
a
lady
wait
in
this
way
wait
said
coconnas
what
an
idea
i
wager
on
the
contrary
that
we
are
ahead
of
time
i
was
well
and
i
too
it
can
not
be
more
than
ten
at
the
latest
well
my
note
said
nine
therefore
i
left
the
louvre
at
nine
i
am
in
the
service
of
monsieur
le
duc
be
it
said
in
passing
and
for
this
reason
i
shall
be
obliged
to
leave
you
in
an
hour
which
pleases
you
no
doubt
no
indeed
considering
the
fact
that
monsieur
is
an
and
capricious
master
moreover
if
i
am
to
be
found
fault
with
i
prefer
to
have
it
done
by
pretty
lips
like
yours
rather
than
by
such
sullen
ones
as
his
ah
said
the
duchess
that
is
a
little
better
you
say
then
that
you
left
the
louvre
at
nine
yes
and
with
every
idea
of
coming
directly
here
when
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
grenelle
i
saw
a
man
who
looked
like
la
mole
good
la
mole
again
always
with
or
without
permission
brutal
man
ah
said
coconnas
we
are
going
to
begin
our
complimentary
speeches
again
not
at
all
but
finish
your
story
i
was
not
the
one
who
wanted
to
tell
it
it
was
you
who
asked
me
why
i
was
late
yes
was
it
my
place
to
arrive
first
well
you
are
not
looking
for
any
one
you
are
growing
tiresome
my
dear
friend
but
go
on
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
grenelle
you
saw
a
man
who
looked
like
la
mole
but
what
is
that
on
your
doublet
blood
yes
and
here
is
more
which
was
probably
sprinkled
over
me
as
he
fell
you
had
a
fight
i
should
think
so
on
account
of
your
la
mole
on
whose
account
do
you
think
i
would
fight
for
a
woman
i
thank
you
so
i
followed
this
man
who
had
the
impudence
to
look
like
my
friend
i
joined
him
in
the
rue
coquillière
i
overtook
him
and
stared
into
his
face
under
the
light
from
a
shop
but
it
was
not
la
mole
good
that
was
well
done
yes
but
he
did
not
think
so
said
i
to
him
are
an
ass
to
take
it
upon
yourself
to
resemble
from
afar
my
friend
monsieur
de
la
mole
who
is
an
accomplished
cavalier
while
on
nearer
view
one
can
easily
perceive
that
you
are
nothing
but
a
vagrant
whereupon
he
drew
his
sword
and
i
mine
at
the
third
pass
he
fell
down
sprinkling
me
with
his
blood
but
you
assisted
him
at
least
i
was
about
to
do
so
when
a
horseman
rode
by
ah
this
time
duchess
i
was
sure
that
it
was
la
mole
unfortunately
he
was
galloping
i
ran
after
him
as
hard
as
i
could
and
those
who
collected
around
to
see
the
fight
ran
behind
me
now
as
i
might
easily
have
been
mistaken
for
a
thief
followed
as
i
was
by
all
that
rabble
shouting
at
my
heels
i
was
obliged
to
turn
back
to
scatter
them
which
made
me
lose
a
little
time
in
the
meanwhile
the
rider
disappeared
i
followed
inquired
of
every
one
gave
the
color
of
the
horse
but
it
was
useless
no
one
had
noticed
him
at
last
tired
out
from
the
chase
i
came
here
tired
of
the
chase
said
the
duchess
how
flattering
you
are
listen
dear
friend
said
coconnas
turning
nonchalantly
in
his
chair
you
are
going
to
bother
me
again
on
account
of
poor
la
mole
now
you
are
wrong
for
friendship
you
see
i
wish
i
had
his
wit
or
knowledge
i
would
then
find
some
comparison
which
would
make
you
understand
how
i
feel
friendship
you
see
is
a
star
while
love
love
wait
i
have
it
love
is
only
a
candle
you
will
tell
me
there
are
several
varieties
of
love
no
of
candles
and
that
some
are
better
than
others
the
rose
for
instance
is
the
best
but
rose
as
it
is
the
candle
burns
out
while
the
star
shines
forever
you
will
answer
this
by
saying
that
when
the
candle
is
burned
out
another
is
put
in
its
place
monsieur
de
coconnas
you
are
a
goose
indeed
monsieur
de
coconnas
you
are
impertinent
ah
monsieur
de
coconnas
you
are
a
scoundrel
madame
i
warn
you
that
you
will
make
me
trebly
regret
la
mole
you
no
longer
love
me
on
the
contrary
duchess
you
do
not
know
it
but
i
idolize
you
but
i
can
love
and
cherish
and
idolize
you
and
yet
in
my
spare
moments
praise
my
friend
so
you
call
the
time
spent
with
me
spare
moments
do
you
what
can
you
expect
poor
la
mole
is
constantly
in
my
thoughts
you
prefer
him
to
me
that
is
shameful
and
i
detest
you
annibal
why
not
be
frank
and
tell
me
you
prefer
him
to
me
annibal
i
warn
you
of
one
thing
if
you
prefer
anything
in
the
world
to
me
henriette
the
loveliest
of
duchesses
for
your
own
peace
of
mind
believe
me
do
not
ask
such
unwise
questions
i
love
you
more
than
any
woman
and
i
love
la
mole
more
than
any
man
well
answered
said
a
strange
voice
suddenly
a
damask
curtain
was
raised
in
front
of
a
great
panel
which
sliding
back
into
the
wall
opened
a
passage
between
the
two
rooms
and
showed
la
mole
in
the
doorway
like
one
of
titian
fine
portraits
in
its
gilded
frame
la
mole
exclaimed
coconnas
without
paying
any
attention
to
marguerite
or
taking
the
time
to
thank
her
for
the
surprise
she
had
arranged
for
him
la
mole
my
friend
my
dear
la
mole
and
he
rushed
into
the
arms
of
his
friend
upsetting
the
armchair
in
which
he
had
been
sitting
and
the
table
that
stood
in
his
way
la
mole
returned
his
embrace
with
effusion
then
turning
to
the
duchesse
de
nevers
pardon
me
madame
if
the
mention
of
my
name
has
sometimes
disturbed
your
happiness
certainly
he
added
glancing
at
marguerite
with
a
look
of
ineffable
tenderness
it
has
not
been
my
fault
that
i
have
not
seen
you
sooner
you
see
henriette
said
marguerite
i
have
kept
my
word
here
he
is
is
it
then
to
the
prayers
of
madame
la
duchesse
that
i
owe
this
happiness
asked
la
mole
to
her
prayers
alone
replied
marguerite
then
turning
to
la
mole
she
continued
la
mole
i
will
allow
you
not
to
believe
one
word
of
what
i
say
meanwhile
coconnas
pressed
his
friend
to
his
heart
over
and
over
again
walked
round
him
a
dozen
times
and
even
held
a
candelabrum
to
his
face
the
better
to
see
him
then
suddenly
turning
he
knelt
down
before
marguerite
and
kissed
the
hem
of
her
robe
ah
that
is
pleasant
said
the
duchesse
de
nevers
i
suppose
now
you
will
find
me
bearable
by
heaven
cried
coconnas
i
shall
find
you
as
adorable
as
ever
only
now
i
can
tell
you
so
with
a
lighter
heart
and
were
there
any
number
of
poles
sarmatians
and
other
hyperborean
barbarians
present
i
should
make
them
all
admit
that
you
were
the
queen
of
beauties
gently
gently
coconnas
said
la
mole
madame
marguerite
is
here
oh
i
can
not
help
that
cried
coconnas
with
the
air
which
belonged
to
him
alone
i
still
assert
that
madame
henriette
is
the
queen
of
beauties
and
madame
marguerite
is
the
beauty
of
queens
but
whatever
he
might
say
or
do
the
piedmontese
completely
carried
away
by
the
joy
of
having
found
his
dear
la
mole
had
neither
eyes
nor
ears
for
any
one
but
him
come
my
beautiful
queen
said
madame
de
nevers
come
let
us
leave
these
dear
friends
to
chat
awhile
alone
they
have
a
thousand
things
to
say
to
each
other
which
would
be
interrupted
by
our
conversation
it
is
hard
for
us
but
it
is
the
only
way
i
am
sure
to
make
monsieur
annibal
perfectly
sane
do
this
for
me
my
queen
since
i
am
foolish
enough
to
love
this
worthless
fellow
as
his
friend
la
mole
calls
him
marguerite
whispered
a
few
words
to
la
mole
who
anxious
as
he
had
been
to
see
his
friend
would
have
been
glad
had
the
affection
of
coconnas
for
him
been
less
exacting
meanwhile
coconnas
was
endeavoring
to
bring
back
a
smile
and
a
gentle
word
to
henriette
lips
a
result
which
was
easily
attained
then
the
two
women
passed
into
the
next
room
where
supper
was
awaiting
them
the
young
men
were
alone
the
first
questions
coconnas
asked
his
friend
were
about
that
fatal
evening
which
had
almost
cost
him
his
life
as
la
mole
proceeded
in
his
story
the
piedmontese
who
however
was
not
easily
moved
trembled
in
every
limb
but
why
said
he
instead
of
running
about
the
country
as
you
have
done
and
causing
me
such
uneasiness
did
you
not
seek
refuge
with
our
master
the
duke
who
had
defended
you
would
have
hidden
you
i
should
have
been
near
you
and
my
grief
although
feigned
would
nevertheless
have
disturbed
every
simpleton
at
court
our
master
said
la
mole
in
a
low
voice
the
duc
yes
according
to
what
he
told
me
i
supposed
it
was
to
him
you
owed
your
life
i
owe
my
life
to
the
king
of
navarre
replied
la
mole
oh
exclaimed
coconnas
are
you
sure
beyond
a
doubt
oh
what
a
good
kind
king
but
what
part
did
the
duc
play
in
it
all
he
held
the
rope
to
strangle
me
by
heaven
cried
coconnas
are
you
sure
of
what
you
say
la
mole
what
this
cur
strangle
my
friend
ah
by
heaven
by
i
will
let
him
know
what
i
think
of
him
are
you
mad
that
is
true
he
would
begin
again
but
what
does
it
matter
things
can
not
go
on
like
this
come
come
coconnas
calm
yourself
and
try
and
remember
that
it
is
eleven
and
that
you
are
on
duty
what
do
i
care
about
my
duty
to
him
bah
let
him
wait
my
attendance
i
serve
a
man
who
has
held
a
rope
you
are
joking
no
this
is
providential
it
is
said
that
i
should
find
you
to
leave
you
no
more
i
shall
stay
here
why
man
alive
think
what
you
are
saying
you
are
not
drunk
i
hope
no
fortunately
if
i
were
i
would
set
fire
to
the
louvre
come
annibal
said
la
mole
be
reasonable
return
to
your
duties
service
is
a
sacred
thing
will
you
return
with
me
impossible
are
they
still
thinking
of
killing
you
i
think
not
i
am
of
too
little
importance
for
them
to
have
any
plot
on
hand
about
me
for
an
instant
they
wanted
to
kill
me
but
that
was
all
the
princes
were
on
a
frolic
that
night
what
are
you
going
to
do
then
nothing
wander
about
or
take
a
walk
well
i
will
walk
too
and
wander
with
you
that
will
be
charming
then
if
you
are
attacked
there
will
be
two
of
us
and
we
will
give
them
no
end
of
trouble
let
him
come
your
duke
i
will
pin
him
to
the
wall
like
a
butterfly
but
at
least
say
that
you
are
going
to
leave
his
service
yes
i
am
in
that
case
tell
him
so
well
that
seems
only
right
i
will
do
so
i
will
write
to
him
write
to
him
that
would
be
discourteous
coconnas
to
a
prince
of
the
blood
yes
of
the
blood
of
the
blood
of
my
friend
take
care
cried
coconnas
rolling
his
large
tragic
eyes
lest
i
trifle
with
points
of
etiquette
probably
said
la
mole
to
himself
in
a
few
days
he
will
need
neither
the
prince
nor
any
one
else
for
if
he
wants
to
come
with
us
we
will
take
him
thereupon
coconnas
took
the
pen
without
further
opposition
from
his
friend
and
hastily
composed
the
following
specimen
of
eloquence
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
your
highness
versed
as
you
are
in
the
writings
of
all
authors
of
antiquity
must
know
the
touching
story
of
orestes
and
pylades
who
were
two
heroes
celebrated
for
their
misfortunes
and
their
friendship
my
friend
la
mole
is
no
less
unfortunate
than
was
orestes
while
i
am
no
less
tender
than
pylades
at
present
he
has
affairs
of
importance
which
demand
my
aid
it
is
therefore
impossible
for
me
to
leave
him
so
with
the
consent
of
your
highness
i
will
take
a
short
vacation
determined
as
i
am
to
attach
myself
to
my
friend
fortune
whithersoever
it
may
lead
me
it
is
with
the
deepest
grief
that
i
tear
myself
away
from
the
service
of
your
highness
but
for
this
i
trust
i
may
obtain
your
pardon
i
venture
to
subscribe
myself
with
respect
my
lord
highness
very
humble
and
very
obedient
comte
de
inseparable
friend
of
monsieur
de
la
this
masterpiece
finished
coconnas
read
it
aloud
to
la
mole
who
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
what
do
you
say
to
it
asked
coconnas
who
had
not
seen
the
shrug
or
who
had
pretended
not
to
see
it
i
say
replied
la
mole
that
monsieur
will
laugh
at
us
at
us
both
of
us
that
will
be
better
it
seems
to
me
than
to
strangle
each
of
us
separately
bah
said
la
mole
laughing
the
one
will
not
necessarily
prevent
the
other
well
so
much
the
worse
come
what
may
i
will
send
the
letter
morning
where
shall
we
sleep
when
we
leave
here
at
maître
la
hurière
in
that
little
room
in
which
you
tried
to
stab
me
before
we
were
orestes
and
pylades
very
well
i
will
send
my
letter
to
the
louvre
by
our
host
just
then
the
panel
moved
well
asked
both
princesses
at
once
where
are
orestes
and
pylades
by
heaven
madame
replied
coconnas
pylades
and
orestes
are
dying
of
hunger
and
love
it
was
maître
la
hurière
himself
who
at
nine
the
following
morning
carried
to
the
louvre
the
respectful
missive
of
count
annibal
de
coconnas
chapter
xlv
orthon
after
the
refusal
of
the
duc
which
left
everything
in
peril
even
his
life
henry
became
more
intimate
with
the
prince
than
ever
if
that
were
possible
catharine
concluded
from
the
intimacy
that
the
two
princes
not
only
understood
each
other
perfectly
but
also
that
they
were
planning
some
mutual
conspiracy
she
questioned
marguerite
on
the
subject
but
marguerite
was
worthy
of
her
mother
and
the
queen
of
navarre
whose
chief
talent
lay
in
avoiding
explanations
parried
her
mother
questions
so
cleverly
that
although
replying
to
all
she
left
catharine
more
mystified
than
ever
the
florentine
therefore
had
nothing
to
guide
her
except
the
spirit
of
intrigue
she
had
brought
with
her
from
tuscany
the
most
interesting
of
the
small
states
of
that
period
and
the
feeling
of
hatred
she
had
imbibed
from
the
court
of
france
which
was
more
divided
in
its
interests
and
opinions
than
any
court
at
that
time
she
realized
that
a
part
of
the
strength
of
the
béarnais
came
from
his
alliance
with
the
duc
and
she
determined
to
separate
them
from
the
moment
she
formed
this
resolution
she
beset
her
son
with
the
patience
and
the
wiles
of
an
angler
who
when
he
has
dropped
his
bait
near
the
fish
unconsciously
draws
it
in
until
his
prey
is
caught
françois
perceived
this
increase
of
affection
on
the
part
of
his
mother
and
made
advances
to
her
as
for
henry
he
pretended
to
see
nothing
but
kept
a
closer
watch
on
his
ally
than
he
had
yet
done
every
one
was
waiting
for
some
event
during
this
state
of
things
one
morning
when
the
sun
rose
clear
giving
out
that
gentle
warmth
and
sweet
odor
which
announce
a
beautiful
day
a
pale
man
leaning
on
a
cane
and
walking
with
difficulty
came
out
of
a
small
house
situated
behind
the
arsenal
and
walked
slowly
along
the
rue
du
petit
muse
at
the
porte
saint
antoine
he
turned
into
the
street
which
encircles
the
moat
of
the
bastille
like
a
marsh
left
the
boulevard
on
his
left
and
entered
the
archery
garden
where
the
gatekeeper
received
him
with
every
mark
of
respect
there
was
no
one
in
the
garden
which
as
its
name
implies
belonged
to
a
particular
society
called
the
taxopholites
had
there
been
any
strollers
there
the
pale
man
would
have
merited
their
sympathy
for
his
long
mustache
his
military
step
and
bearing
though
weakened
by
suffering
sufficiently
indicated
that
he
was
an
officer
who
had
been
recently
wounded
and
who
was
endeavoring
to
regain
his
strength
by
moderate
exercise
in
the
open
air
yet
strange
to
say
when
the
cloak
opened
in
which
in
spite
of
the
increasing
heat
this
apparently
harmless
man
was
wrapped
it
displayed
a
pair
of
long
pistols
suspended
from
the
silver
clasps
of
his
belt
this
belt
also
sustained
a
dagger
and
a
sword
so
enormously
long
that
it
seemed
almost
impossible
to
be
handled
and
which
completing
this
living
arsenal
clattered
against
his
shrunken
and
trembling
legs
as
an
additional
precaution
the
lonely
soldier
glanced
around
at
every
step
as
though
to
question
each
turn
of
the
path
each
bush
and
ditch
having
entered
the
garden
without
being
molested
the
man
reached
a
sort
of
small
arbor
facing
the
boulevard
from
which
it
was
separated
by
a
thick
hedge
and
a
small
ditch
which
formed
a
double
inclosure
he
threw
himself
upon
a
grassy
bank
within
reach
of
a
table
on
which
the
host
of
the
establishment
who
combined
with
his
duties
as
gatekeeper
the
vocation
of
cook
at
once
placed
a
bottle
of
cordial
the
invalid
had
been
there
about
ten
minutes
and
had
several
times
raised
the
china
cup
to
his
lips
taking
little
sips
of
its
contents
when
suddenly
his
countenance
in
spite
of
its
interesting
pallor
assumed
a
startled
expression
from
the
croix
faubin
along
a
path
which
is
the
rue
de
naples
he
had
perceived
a
cavalier
wrapped
in
a
great
cloak
stop
near
the
moat
not
more
than
five
minutes
had
elapsed
during
which
the
man
of
the
pale
face
whom
the
reader
has
perhaps
already
recognized
as
maurevel
had
scarcely
had
time
to
recover
from
the
emotion
caused
by
his
unexpected
presence
when
the
horseman
was
joined
by
a
man
in
a
coat
like
that
of
a
page
who
came
by
the
road
which
is
since
known
as
the
rue
des
fossés
saint
nicholas
hidden
in
his
leafy
arbor
maurevel
could
easily
see
and
hear
everything
and
when
it
is
known
that
the
cavalier
was
de
mouy
and
the
young
man
in
the
cloak
orthon
one
may
imagine
whether
maurevel
eyes
and
ears
were
not
on
the
alert
both
men
looked
very
carefully
around
maurevel
held
his
breath
you
may
speak
monsieur
said
orthon
who
being
the
younger
was
the
more
confident
no
one
can
either
see
or
hear
us
that
is
well
said
de
mouy
you
are
to
go
to
madame
de
sauve
and
if
you
find
her
in
her
rooms
give
her
this
note
if
she
is
not
there
you
will
place
it
behind
the
mirror
where
the
king
is
in
the
habit
of
putting
his
letters
then
you
will
wait
in
the
louvre
if
you
receive
an
answer
you
will
bring
it
you
know
where
if
no
reply
is
sent
you
will
meet
me
this
evening
with
a
petronel
at
the
spot
i
showed
you
and
from
which
i
have
just
come
very
well
said
orthon
i
understand
i
will
now
leave
you
i
have
much
to
do
you
need
make
no
haste
there
is
no
use
in
it
for
you
do
not
need
to
reach
the
louvre
until
he
is
there
and
i
think
he
is
taking
a
lesson
in
hawking
this
morning
now
go
and
show
me
what
you
can
do
you
have
recovered
and
you
apparently
are
going
to
thank
madame
de
sauve
for
her
kindness
to
you
during
your
illness
now
go
my
boy
maurevel
listened
his
eyes
fixed
his
hair
on
end
his
forehead
covered
with
perspiration
his
first
impulse
had
been
to
detach
one
of
his
pistols
from
his
belt
and
aim
at
de
mouy
but
a
movement
of
the
latter
had
opened
his
cloak
and
displayed
a
firm
and
solid
cuirass
therefore
in
all
probability
the
ball
would
flatten
itself
against
this
cuirass
or
strike
some
part
of
the
body
wherein
the
wound
would
not
be
fatal
besides
he
reflected
that
de
mouy
strong
and
well
armed
would
have
an
advantage
over
him
wounded
as
he
was
so
with
a
sigh
he
drew
back
the
weapon
which
he
had
pointed
at
the
huguenot
how
unfortunate
he
murmured
that
i
am
unable
to
stretch
him
dead
on
the
spot
without
other
witness
than
that
young
varlet
who
would
have
been
such
a
good
mark
for
my
second
ball
but
maurevel
thought
that
the
note
given
to
orthon
and
which
he
was
to
deliver
to
madame
de
sauve
might
perhaps
be
of
more
importance
than
the
life
of
the
huguenot
chief
well
said
he
you
have
escaped
me
again
this
morning
be
it
so
i
will
have
my
turn
at
you
if
i
have
to
follow
you
into
that
hell
from
which
you
have
come
to
ruin
me
unless
i
destroy
you
de
mouy
raised
his
cloak
over
his
face
and
set
out
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
the
temple
orthon
took
the
road
along
the
moat
which
led
to
the
banks
of
the
river
then
maurevel
rising
with
more
energy
and
vigor
than
he
had
dared
to
hope
for
regained
the
rue
de
la
cerisaie
reached
his
home
ordered
a
horse
to
be
saddled
and
weak
as
he
was
and
at
the
risk
of
opening
his
wounds
again
set
off
at
a
gallop
to
the
rue
saint
antoine
reached
the
quays
and
entered
the
louvre
five
minutes
after
he
had
passed
under
the
gate
catharine
knew
all
that
had
just
taken
place
and
maurevel
had
received
the
thousand
golden
crowns
promised
him
for
the
arrest
of
the
king
of
navarre
oh
said
catharine
either
i
am
mistaken
or
this
de
mouy
is
the
black
spot
that
was
discovered
by
réné
in
the
horoscope
of
the
accursed
béarnais
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
maurevel
orthon
entered
the
louvre
showed
himself
as
de
mouy
had
directed
and
went
to
the
apartments
of
madame
de
sauve
after
having
spoken
to
several
attendants
of
the
palace
dariole
was
the
only
one
in
her
mistress
rooms
catharine
had
asked
the
latter
to
write
certain
important
letters
and
she
had
been
with
the
queen
for
the
last
five
minutes
no
matter
said
orthon
i
will
wait
taking
advantage
of
his
intimacy
in
the
house
the
young
man
went
into
the
of
the
baroness
and
having
assured
himself
that
he
was
alone
he
laid
the
note
behind
the
mirror
just
as
he
was
removing
his
hand
catharine
entered
orthon
turned
pale
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
quick
searching
glance
of
the
queen
mother
was
first
directed
to
the
mirror
what
are
you
doing
here
my
little
man
asked
catharine
looking
for
madame
de
sauve
yes
madame
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
saw
her
and
if
i
delay
any
longer
in
thanking
her
i
fear
she
will
think
me
ungrateful
you
love
this
dear
charlotte
very
much
do
you
not
with
all
my
heart
madame
and
you
are
faithful
from
what
i
hear
your
majesty
will
understand
that
this
is
very
natural
when
you
know
that
madame
de
sauve
took
more
care
of
me
than
i
being
only
an
humble
servant
deserved
and
upon
what
occasion
did
she
bestow
all
this
care
on
you
asked
catharine
pretending
to
be
ignorant
of
what
had
happened
to
the
youth
when
i
was
wounded
madame
ah
poor
boy
said
catharine
you
were
wounded
yes
madame
when
was
that
the
night
they
tried
to
arrest
the
king
of
navarre
i
was
so
terrified
at
sight
of
the
soldiers
that
i
called
and
shouted
and
one
of
the
men
gave
me
a
blow
on
the
head
which
knocked
me
senseless
poor
boy
and
are
you
quite
recovered
now
yes
madame
so
that
you
are
trying
to
get
back
into
the
service
of
the
king
of
navarre
no
madame
when
the
king
of
navarre
learned
that
i
had
dared
to
resist
your
majesty
order
he
dismissed
me
at
once
indeed
said
catharine
in
a
tone
full
of
interest
well
i
will
see
to
that
affair
but
if
you
are
waiting
for
madame
de
sauve
you
will
wait
in
vain
for
she
is
occupied
in
my
apartments
whereupon
thinking
that
orthon
perhaps
had
not
had
time
to
hide
his
note
behind
the
mirror
catharine
stepped
into
the
adjoining
room
in
order
to
give
him
the
necessary
opportunity
but
just
as
orthon
anxious
at
the
unexpected
arrival
of
the
queen
mother
was
wondering
whether
her
coming
did
not
forebode
some
plot
against
his
master
he
heard
three
gentle
taps
against
the
ceiling
this
was
the
signal
which
he
himself
was
in
the
habit
of
giving
his
master
in
case
of
danger
when
the
latter
was
with
madame
de
sauve
and
orthon
was
keeping
guard
he
started
at
the
sound
a
light
broke
upon
his
mind
he
fancied
that
this
time
the
warning
had
been
given
to
him
springing
to
the
mirror
he
removed
the
note
he
had
just
placed
there
through
an
opening
in
the
tapestry
catharine
had
followed
every
movement
of
the
boy
she
saw
him
dart
to
the
mirror
but
she
did
not
know
whether
it
was
to
hide
the
note
or
take
it
away
well
murmured
the
impatient
florentine
why
does
he
not
leave
now
and
she
returned
to
the
room
smiling
still
here
my
boy
said
she
why
what
do
you
want
did
i
not
tell
you
that
i
would
look
after
your
fortune
when
i
say
a
thing
you
do
not
doubt
it
do
you
oh
madame
god
forbid
replied
orthon
and
approaching
the
queen
he
bent
his
knee
kissed
the
hem
of
her
robe
and
at
once
withdrew
as
he
went
through
the
antechamber
he
saw
the
captain
of
the
guards
who
was
waiting
for
catharine
the
sight
of
this
man
instead
of
allaying
his
suspicions
augmented
them
on
her
part
no
sooner
had
she
seen
the
curtains
fall
behind
orthon
than
catharine
sprang
to
the
mirror
but
in
vain
she
sought
behind
it
with
hands
trembling
with
impatience
she
found
no
note
and
yet
she
was
sure
that
she
had
seen
the
boy
approach
the
mirror
it
was
to
remove
the
note
therefore
and
not
to
leave
it
fate
had
given
to
her
enemies
a
strength
equal
to
her
own
a
child
had
become
a
man
the
moment
he
fought
with
her
she
moved
the
mirror
looked
behind
it
tapped
it
nothing
was
there
oh
unhappy
boy
cried
she
i
wished
him
no
ill
and
now
by
removing
the
note
he
hastens
his
destiny
ho
there
monsieur
de
nancey
the
vibrating
tones
of
the
queen
mother
rang
through
the
salon
and
penetrated
into
the
anteroom
where
as
we
have
said
monsieur
de
nancey
was
waiting
the
captain
of
the
guards
hastened
to
the
queen
here
i
am
madame
said
he
what
is
your
majesty
will
have
you
been
in
the
antechamber
yes
madame
did
you
see
a
young
man
a
child
pass
through
just
now
he
can
not
have
gone
far
can
he
scarcely
to
the
stairway
call
him
back
what
is
his
name
orthon
if
he
refuses
to
come
bring
him
back
by
force
but
do
not
frighten
him
unless
he
resists
i
must
speak
to
him
at
once
the
captain
of
the
guards
hurriedly
withdrew
as
he
had
said
orthon
was
scarcely
half
way
down
the
stairs
for
he
was
descending
slowly
hoping
to
meet
or
see
the
king
of
navarre
or
madame
de
sauve
somewhere
he
heard
his
name
and
gave
a
start
his
first
impulse
was
to
run
but
with
forethought
beyond
his
years
he
realized
that
by
doing
so
all
would
be
lost
he
stopped
therefore
who
calls
me
i
monsieur
de
nancey
replied
the
captain
of
the
guards
hurrying
down
the
stairs
but
i
am
in
haste
said
orthon
by
order
of
her
majesty
the
queen
mother
said
monsieur
de
nancey
as
he
came
up
to
him
the
youth
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
and
turned
back
the
captain
followed
catharine
first
idea
had
been
to
stop
the
young
man
have
him
searched
and
take
possession
of
the
note
which
she
knew
he
had
she
had
planned
to
accuse
him
of
theft
and
with
this
end
in
view
she
had
removed
from
the
toilet
table
a
diamond
clasp
which
she
was
going
to
say
he
had
taken
but
on
reflection
she
concluded
that
this
would
be
dangerous
in
that
it
would
arouse
the
boy
suspicions
and
he
would
inform
his
master
who
would
then
begin
to
mistrust
something
and
so
her
enemy
would
gain
an
advantage
over
her
she
could
no
doubt
have
the
young
man
taken
to
some
dungeon
but
the
rumor
of
the
arrest
however
secretly
it
might
be
done
would
spread
through
the
louvre
and
the
slightest
inkling
of
it
would
put
henry
on
his
guard
however
she
must
have
the
note
for
a
note
from
monsieur
de
mouy
to
the
king
of
navarre
a
note
sent
with
such
precautions
surely
meant
conspiracy
she
put
back
the
clasp
from
where
she
had
taken
it
no
no
said
she
that
would
be
the
method
of
a
guard
it
is
poor
but
for
a
note
which
perhaps
after
all
is
not
worth
the
trouble
she
continued
frowning
and
speaking
so
low
that
she
herself
could
scarcely
hear
the
sound
of
her
words
well
it
is
not
my
fault
but
his
why
did
not
the
little
scoundrel
put
the
note
where
he
should
have
put
it
i
must
have
this
letter
just
then
orthon
entered
catharine
face
wore
such
a
terrible
expression
that
the
youth
stopped
on
the
threshold
pale
as
death
he
was
still
too
young
to
be
perfect
master
of
himself
madame
said
he
you
have
done
me
the
honor
of
calling
me
back
in
what
can
i
serve
your
majesty
catharine
face
lighted
up
as
if
a
ray
of
sunlight
had
touched
it
i
called
you
back
my
child
said
she
because
your
face
pleases
me
and
having
promised
to
help
you
i
am
anxious
to
do
so
without
delay
we
queens
are
sometimes
accused
of
being
forgetful
but
this
is
not
on
account
of
our
hearts
but
because
our
minds
are
filled
with
business
now
i
remembered
that
kings
hold
men
fortunes
in
their
hands
and
so
i
called
you
back
follow
me
my
child
monsieur
de
nancey
who
was
taking
the
affair
seriously
was
greatly
surprised
at
catharine
affectionate
manner
can
you
ride
my
child
asked
catharine
yes
madame
then
come
into
my
room
i
want
to
give
you
a
message
to
carry
to
saint
germain
i
am
at
your
majesty
command
order
a
horse
to
be
saddled
de

monsieur
de
nancey
disappeared
come
boy
said
catharine
leading
the
way
orthon
followed
the
queen
mother
descended
to
the
next
floor
entered
the
corridor
in
which
were
the
apartments
of
the
king
and
the
duc
reached
the
winding
staircase
again
descended
a
flight
of
stairs
and
opened
a
door
leading
to
a
circular
gallery
to
which
none
but
the
king
and
herself
possessed
the
key
bidding
orthon
pass
in
first
she
entered
after
him
and
locked
the
door
this
gallery
formed
a
sort
of
rampart
to
a
certain
portion
of
the
apartments
of
the
king
and
the
queen
mother
and
like
the
corridor
of
the
castle
of
saint
angelo
at
rome
or
that
of
the
pitti
palace
at
florence
was
a
safe
place
in
case
of
danger
the
door
locked
catharine
was
alone
with
the
young
man
in
the
dark
corridor
each
advanced
a
few
steps
the
queen
leading
the
way
orthon
following
suddenly
catharine
turned
and
orthon
again
saw
on
her
face
the
same
sinister
expression
which
he
had
seen
on
it
a
few
minutes
before
her
eyes
were
as
round
as
those
of
a
cat
or
a
panther
and
seemed
to
dart
forth
fire
in
the
darkness
stop
she
cried
orthon
felt
a
shiver
run
through
him
a
deathly
cold
like
an
icy
cloak
seemed
to
fall
from
the
ceiling
the
floor
felt
like
the
covering
of
a
tomb
catharine
glance
was
so
sharp
that
it
seemed
to
penetrate
to
the
very
soul
of
the
page
he
recoiled
and
leaned
against
the
wall
trembling
from
head
to
foot
where
is
the
note
you
were
charged
to
give
to
the
king
of
navarre
the
note
stammered
orthon
yes
which
if
you
did
not
find
him
you
were
to
place
behind
the
mirror
i
madame
said
orthon
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
the
note
which
de
mouy
gave
you
an
hour
ago
behind
the
archery
garden
i
have
no
note
said
orthon
your
majesty
must
be
mistaken
you
lie
said
catharine
give
me
the
note
and
i
will
keep
the
promise
i
made
you
what
promise
madame
i
will
make
your
fortune
i
have
no
note
madame
repeated
the
child
catharine
ground
her
teeth
then
assuming
a
smile
give
it
to
me
said
she
and
you
shall
have
a
thousand
golden
crowns
i
have
no
note
madame
two
thousand
crowns
impossible
since
i
have
no
note
how
can
i
give
it
to
you
ten
thousand
crowns
orthon
orthon
who
saw
the
anger
of
the
queen
rising
felt
that
there
was
only
one
way
of
saving
his
master
and
that
was
to
swallow
the
note
he
put
his
hand
to
his
pocket
but
catharine
guessed
his
intention
and
stopped
him
there
my
child
said
she
laughing
you
are
certainly
faithful
when
kings
wish
to
attach
a
follower
to
them
there
is
no
harm
in
their
making
sure
of
his
trustworthiness
here
take
this
purse
as
a
first
reward
go
and
carry
your
note
to
your
master
and
tell
him
that
from
you
are
in
my
service
you
can
get
out
without
me
by
the
door
we
entered
it
opens
from
within
and
giving
the
purse
to
the
astonished
youth
catharine
walked
on
a
few
steps
and
placed
her
hand
against
the
wall
but
the
young
man
stood
still
hesitating
he
could
not
believe
that
the
danger
he
had
felt
hovering
over
him
was
gone
come
do
not
tremble
so
said
catharine
have
i
not
told
you
that
you
were
free
to
go
and
that
if
you
wish
to
come
back
your
fortune
is
made
thank
you
madame
said
orthon
then
you
pardon
me
i
do
more
i
reward
you
you
are
a
faithful
bearer
of
notes
a
gentle
messenger
of
love
but
you
forget
your
master
is
waiting
for
you
ah
that
is
true
said
the
young
man
springing
towards
the
door
but
scarcely
had
he
advanced
three
steps
before
the
floor
gave
way
beneath
his
feet
he
stumbled
extended
both
hands
gave
a
fearful
cry
and
disappeared
in
the
dungeon
of
the
louvre
the
spring
of
which
catharine
had
just
touched
so
murmured
the
queen
thanks
to
the
fellow
obstinacy
i
shall
have
to
descend
a
hundred
and
fifty
steps
the
queen
mother
returned
to
her
apartments
lighted
a
dark
lantern
came
back
to
the
corridor
closed
the
spring
and
opened
the
door
of
a
spiral
staircase
which
seemed
to
lead
to
the
bowels
of
the
earth
urged
on
by
the
insatiable
thirst
of
a
curiosity
which
was
but
the
minister
of
her
hatred
she
reached
an
iron
door
which
turned
on
its
hinges
and
admitted
her
to
the
depths
of
the
dungeon
bleeding
crushed
and
mutilated
by
a
fall
of
a
hundred
feet
or
more
but
still
breathing
lay
poor
orthon
beyond
the
thick
wall
the
waters
of
the
seine
were
heard
roaring
brought
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
by
a
subterranean
channel
catharine
entered
the
damp
and
unwholesome
place
which
during
her
reign
had
witnessed
many
a
fall
similar
to
the
one
it
had
just
seen
searched
the
body
seized
the
letter
made
sure
that
it
was
the
one
she
desired
then
pushing
aside
the
body
with
her
foot
she
pressed
a
spring
the
bottom
of
the
dungeon
sank
and
the
corpse
carried
down
by
its
own
weight
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
river
closing
the
door
again
catharine
ascended
shut
herself
in
her
closet
and
read
the
note
which
contained
these
words
evening
at
ten
rue
de
sec
hôtel
de
la
belle
étoile
if
you
come
send
no
reply
otherwise
send
back
no
by
the
mouy
de
saint
as
catharine
read
this
note
a
smile
came
to
her
lips
she
was
thinking
of
the
victory
she
was
to
gain
forgetting
the
price
at
which
she
had
bought
it
but
after
all
what
was
orthon
a
faithful
devoted
follower
a
handsome
young
boy
that
was
all
that
one
may
well
imagine
would
not
for
an
instant
have
turned
the
scales
on
which
the
fate
of
empires
had
been
weighed
the
note
read
catharine
at
once
went
to
madame
de
sauve
and
placed
it
behind
the
mirror
as
she
came
down
she
found
the
captain
of
the
guards
at
the
entrance
of
the
corridor
madame
said
monsieur
de
nancey
according
to
your
majesty
orders
the
horse
is
ready
my
dear
baron
said
catharine
we
shall
not
need
it
i
have
made
the
boy
speak
and
he
is
really
too
stupid
to
be
charged
with
the
errand
i
wanted
to
entrust
to
him
i
thought
he
was
a
lackey
but
he
is
nothing
but
a
groom
at
best
i
gave
him
some
money
and
dismissed
him
by
the
private
gate
but
said
monsieur
de
nancey
the
errand
the
errand
asked
catharine
the
one
on
which
he
was
to
go
to
saint
germain
does
your
majesty
wish
me
to
undertake
it
or
shall
i
have
one
of
my
men
attend
to
it
no
no
said
catharine
this
evening
you
and
your
men
will
have
something
else
to
do
whereupon
the
queen
mother
returned
to
her
room
hoping
that
evening
to
hold
in
her
hands
the
fate
of
the
accursed
king
of
navarre
chapter
xlvi
the
inn
of
la
belle
étoile
two
hours
after
the
event
we
have
described
no
trace
of
which
remained
on
catharine
face
madame
de
sauve
having
finished
her
work
for
the
queen
returned
to
her
own
rooms
henry
followed
her
and
learning
from
dariole
that
orthon
had
been
there
he
went
directly
to
the
mirror
and
found
the
note
it
was
as
we
have
said
couched
in
these
terms
evening
at
ten
rue
de
sec
hôtel
de
la
belle
étoile
if
you
come
send
no
reply
otherwise
send
back
no
by
the
there
was
no
address
henry
will
not
fail
to
keep
the
appointment
said
catharine
for
even
had
he
not
wished
to
do
so
there
is
no
longer
a
messenger
to
take
back
his
answer
catharine
was
not
mistaken
henry
inquired
for
orthon
dariole
said
that
he
had
gone
out
with
the
queen
mother
but
as
the
note
had
been
found
in
its
place
and
as
the
poor
boy
was
known
to
be
incapable
of
treason
henry
felt
no
anxiety
he
dined
as
usual
at
the
table
of
the
king
who
joked
him
greatly
on
the
mistakes
he
had
made
while
hawking
that
morning
henry
made
excuses
for
himself
saying
that
he
came
from
the
mountains
and
not
the
plain
but
he
promised
charles
to
study
the
art
catharine
was
charming
and
on
leaving
the
table
begged
marguerite
to
pass
the
evening
with
her
at
eight
henry
took
two
attendants
left
by
the
porte
saint
honoré
made
a
long
circuit
returned
by
the
tour
de
bois
and
crossing
the
seine
at
the
ferry
of
nesle
rode
up
the
rue
saint
jacques
where
he
dismissed
his
gentlemen
as
if
he
were
going
to
keep
some
love
appointment
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
mathurins
he
found
a
man
on
horseback
wrapped
in
a
cloak
he
approached
him
mantes
said
the
man
pau
replied
the
king
the
man
at
once
dismounted
henry
put
on
his
splashed
mantle
mounted
the
horse
which
was
covered
with
foam
returned
by
the
rue
de
la
harpe
crossed
the
pont
saint
michel
passed
down
the
rue
barthélemy
again
crossed
the
river
at
the
pont
aux
meuniers
descended
the
quays
took
the
rue
de
sec
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
maître
la
hurière
la
mole
was
in
a
room
writing
a
long
to
whom
may
easily
be
imagined
coconnas
was
in
the
kitchen
with
la
hurière
watching
half
a
dozen
partridges
roasting
and
disputing
with
his
friend
the
host
as
to
when
they
should
be
removed
from
the
spit
at
this
moment
henry
knocked
grégoire
opened
the
door
and
led
the
horse
to
the
stable
while
the
traveller
entered
stamping
on
the
floor
as
if
to
warm
his
benumbed
feet
maître
la
hurière
said
la
mole
as
he
continued
to
write
here
is
a
gentleman
asking
for
you
la
hurière
advanced
looked
at
henry
from
head
to
foot
and
as
his
thick
cloth
mantle
did
not
inspire
the
innkeeper
with
very
great
veneration
who
are
you
he
asked
well
by
heaven
said
henry
pointing
to
la
mole
monsieur
has
just
told
you
i
am
a
gentleman
from
gascony
come
to
court
what
do
you
want
a
room
and
supper
humph
said
la
hurière
have
you
a
lackey
this
was
the
question
usually
asked
as
is
well
known
no
replied
henry
but
i
hope
to
have
one
when
i
make
my
fortune
i
do
not
let
rooms
to
any
one
unless
he
has
a
lackey
said
la
hurière
even
if
i
offered
to
pay
you
double
for
your
supper
oh
you
are
very
generous
worthy
sir
said
la
hurière
looking
suspiciously
at
henry
not
at
all
but
hoping
to
pass
the
night
in
your
hotel
which
has
been
highly
recommended
by
a
nobleman
from
my
county
who
has
been
here
i
invited
a
friend
to
sup
with
me
have
you
any
good
wine
of
arbois
i
have
some
which
is
better
than
the
king
of
navarre
drinks
good
i
will
pay
well
for
it
ah
here
is
my
friend
just
then
the
door
opened
and
a
gentleman
entered
older
by
a
few
years
than
the
first
and
dragging
a
long
rapier
at
his
side
ah
said
he
you
are
prompt
my
young
friend
for
a
man
who
has
just
made
two
hundred
leagues
it
is
something
to
be
so
punctual
is
this
your
guest
asked
la
hurière
yes
said
the
first
going
up
to
the
young
man
with
the
rapier
and
shaking
him
by
the
hand
we
will
have
our
supper
now
here
or
in
your
room
wherever
you
please
maître
said
la
mole
to
la
hurière
rid
us
of
these
huguenot
fellows
coconnas
and
i
can
not
say
a
word
before
them
carry
the
supper
to
room
no
on
the
third
floor
upstairs
gentlemen
the
two
travellers
followed
grégoire
who
preceded
them
with
lights
la
mole
watched
them
until
they
had
disappeared
then
turning
round
he
saw
coconnas
whose
head
was
thrust
out
of
the
kitchen
door
two
great
eyes
and
an
open
mouth
gave
to
the
latter
face
a
remarkable
expression
of
astonishment
la
mole
stepped
up
to
him
by
heaven
said
coconnas
did
you
see
what
those
two
gentlemen
well
i
would
swear
that
it
was
who
why
the
king
of
navarre
and
the
man
in
the
red
cloak
swear
if
you
will
but
not
too
loud
did
you
recognize
them
too
certainly
what
are
they
here
for
some
love
affair
you
think
so
i
am
sure
of
it
la
mole
i
prefer
to
these
love
affairs
i
would
have
sworn
a
moment
ago
now
i
will
bet
what
will
you
bet
that
there
is
some
plot
on
hand
you
are
mad
i
tell
you
i
tell
you
that
even
if
they
are
plotting
it
is
their
own
affair
that
is
true
however
said
coconnas
i
no
longer
belong
to
monsieur
so
let
them
do
as
they
see
fit
as
the
partridges
had
apparently
reached
the
state
in
which
coconnas
liked
them
the
piedmontese
who
counted
on
making
the
most
of
his
dinner
of
them
called
maître
la
hurière
to
remove
them
from
the
spit
meantime
henry
and
de
mouy
were
installed
in
their
chamber
well
sire
said
de
mouy
when
grégoire
had
set
the
table
have
you
seen
orthon
no
but
i
found
the
note
he
left
behind
the
mirror
the
boy
must
have
become
frightened
i
suppose
for
queen
catharine
came
in
while
he
was
there
so
he
went
away
without
waiting
for
my
answer
for
a
moment
i
felt
somewhat
anxious
about
him
as
dariole
told
me
that
the
queen
mother
had
had
a
long
talk
with
him
oh
there
is
no
danger
the
boy
is
clever
and
although
the
queen
mother
knows
his
profession
he
will
not
let
her
find
out
much
from
him
i
am
sure
but
have
you
seen
him
de
mouy
asked
henry
no
but
i
expect
to
this
evening
at
midnight
he
is
to
come
here
for
me
with
a
good
petronel
he
will
tell
me
what
happened
as
we
walk
along
and
the
man
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
mathurins
what
man
the
man
who
gave
me
his
horse
and
cloak
are
you
sure
of
him
he
is
one
of
our
most
devoted
followers
besides
he
neither
knows
your
majesty
nor
why
he
himself
was
there
can
we
discuss
our
affairs
without
fear
then
certainly
besides
la
mole
is
on
the
watch
well
sire
what
says
monsieur
monsieur
will
not
go
de
mouy
he
said
so
positively
the
election
of
to
the
throne
of
poland
and
the
king
illness
have
changed
his
mind
so
he
is
the
one
who
spoiled
our
plan
yes
has
he
betrayed
us
not
yet
but
he
will
do
so
at
the
first
opportunity
coward
traitor
why
did
he
not
answer
my
letters
in
order
to
have
proofs
against
you
and
none
against
himself
meantime
all
is
lost
is
it
not
de
mouy
on
the
contrary
sire
all
is
won
you
know
that
the
whole
party
except
the
faction
of
the
prince
de
condé
was
for
you
and
used
the
duke
with
whom
it
seemed
to
have
relations
only
as
a
safeguard
well
since
the
day
of
the
ceremony
i
have
arranged
so
that
everything
is
for
you
one
hundred
men
were
enough
to
escape
with
the
duc
i
have
raised
fifteen
hundred
in
one
week
they
will
be
ready
and
drawn
up
on
the
road
to
pau
it
will
not
be
a
flight
but
a
retreat
fifteen
hundred
men
will
suffice
sire
will
they
not
shall
you
feel
safe
with
such
an
army
henry
smiled
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
you
know
de
mouy
said
he
and
you
alone
know
it
that
henry
of
navarre
is
not
naturally
such
a
coward
as
is
supposed
yes
i
know
that
sire
and
i
trust
before
long
that
all
france
will
know
it
too
but
where
one
plots
one
must
succeed
the
first
condition
of
success
is
decision
and
for
decision
to
be
rapid
frank
and
to
the
point
one
must
be
sure
of
success
well
sire
what
days
do
you
hunt
every
week
or
ten
days
we
either
hunt
or
hawk
when
did
you
hunt
last
then
a
week
or
ten
days
from
now
you
will
hunt
again
no
doubt
possibly
before
then
listen
sire
everything
seems
perfectly
quiet
the
duc
has
left
no
one
thinks
of
him
the
king
is
getting
better
every
day
the
persecution
against
us
has
almost
ceased
play
the
amiable
with
the
queen
mother
and
monsieur
keep
telling
him
that
you
can
not
go
without
him
and
try
to
make
him
believe
you
which
is
more
difficult
do
not
worry
he
will
believe
me
do
you
think
he
has
such
confidence
in
you
no
god
forbid
but
he
believes
everything
the
queen
says
and
is
the
queen
true
to
us
oh
i
have
proof
of
it
besides
she
is
ambitious
and
is
dying
for
this
crown
of
navarre
well
three
days
before
the
hunt
send
me
word
where
it
will
take
place
whether
it
is
to
be
at
bondy
at
saint
germain
or
at
rambouillet
monsieur
de
la
mole
will
ride
ahead
of
you
follow
him
and
ride
fast
once
out
of
the
forest
if
the
queen
mother
wants
you
she
will
have
to
run
after
you
and
i
trust
that
her
norman
horses
will
not
see
even
the
hoofs
of
our
barbary
steeds
and
our
spanish
ponies
agreed
de
mouy
have
you
any
money
sire
henry
made
the
same
grimace
he
made
all
his
life
at
this
question
not
much
said
he
but
i
think
margot
has
some
well
whether
it
is
yours
or
hers
bring
as
much
as
you
can
and
in
the
meantime
what
are
you
going
to
do
having
paid
some
attention
to
your
majesty
affairs
as
you
see
will
your
majesty
permit
me
to
devote
a
little
time
to
my
own
certainly
de
mouy
certainly
but
what
are
yours
yesterday
orthon
told
me
he
is
a
very
intelligent
boy
whom
i
recommend
to
your
majesty
that
he
met
that
scoundrel
of
a
maurevel
near
the
arsenal
that
thanks
to
réné
he
has
recovered
and
that
he
was
warming
himself
in
the
sun
like
the
snake
that
he
is
ah
yes
i
understand
said
henry
very
good
then
you
will
be
king
some
day
sire
and
if
you
have
anything
such
as
i
have
to
avenge
you
can
do
so
in
a
kingly
way
i
am
a
soldier
and
must
avenge
myself
like
a
soldier
so
while
all
our
little
affairs
are
being
arranged
which
will
give
that
scoundrel
five
or
six
days
in
which
to
recover
more
fully
i
too
shall
take
a
stroll
around
the
arsenal
and
i
will
pin
him
to
the
grass
with
four
blows
of
my
rapier
after
which
i
shall
leave
paris
with
a
lighter
heart
attend
to
your
affairs
my
friend
by
all
means
said
the
béarnais
by
the
way
you
are
pleased
with
la
mole
are
you
not
yes
he
is
a
charming
fellow
devoted
to
you
body
and
soul
sire
and
on
whom
you
can
depend
as
you
can
on
me
brave
and
above
all
discreet
so
he
must
follow
us
to
navarre
de
mouy
once
there
we
will
look
about
and
see
what
we
can
do
to
recompense
him
as
henry
concluded
these
words
with
a
sly
smile
the
door
opened
or
rather
was
broken
in
and
the
man
they
had
just
been
praising
appeared
pale
and
agitated
quick
sire
cried
he
quick
the
house
is
surrounded
surrounded
cried
henry
rising
by
whom
by
the
king
guards
oh
said
de
mouy
drawing
his
pistols
from
his
belt
we
are
to
have
a
battle
apparently
well
said
la
mole
you
may
well
talk
of
pistols
and
battle
but
what
can
you
do
against
fifty
men
he
is
right
said
the
king
and
if
there
were
any
means
of
escape
there
is
one
which
has
already
been
of
use
to
me
and
if
your
majesty
will
follow
me
and
de
mouy
and
de
mouy
too
if
he
wishes
but
you
must
be
quick
steps
were
heard
on
the
stairs
it
is
too
late
said
henry
ah
if
any
one
would
only
engage
them
for
five
minutes
cried
la
mole
i
would
save
the
king
save
him
then
monsieur
said
de
mouy
i
will
look
after
them
go
sire
go
but
what
shall
you
do
do
not
fear
sire
but
go
and
de
mouy
began
by
hiding
the
king
plate
napkin
and
goblet
so
that
it
might
seem
as
though
he
had
been
alone
at
table
come
sire
come
cried
la
mole
seizing
the
king
by
the
arm
and
dragging
him
towards
the
stairway
de
mouy
my
brave
de
mouy
exclaimed
henry
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
young
man
de
mouy
kissed
the
hand
pushed
henry
from
the
room
and
closed
and
bolted
the
door
after
him
yes
i
understand
said
henry
he
will
be
caught
while
we
escape
but
who
the
devil
can
have
betrayed
us
come
sire
come
they
are
on
the
stairs
in
fact
the
light
of
the
torches
was
beginning
to
be
seen
on
the
wall
while
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
sounds
like
the
clanking
of
swords
were
heard
quick
quick
sire
cried
la
mole
and
guiding
the
king
in
the
darkness
he
ascended
two
flights
pushed
open
a
door
which
he
locked
behind
him
and
opening
the
window
of
a
closet
sire
said
he
is
your
majesty
very
much
afraid
of
a
walk
across
the
roofs
i
said
henry
come
now
am
i
not
a
chamois
hunter
well
your
majesty
must
follow
me
i
know
the
way
and
will
guide
you
go
on
said
henry
i
will
follow
la
mole
stepped
out
went
along
the
ledge
which
formed
a
sort
of
gutter
at
the
end
of
which
they
came
to
a
depression
between
two
roofs
in
this
way
they
reached
an
open
window
leading
to
an
empty
garret
sire
said
la
mole
here
we
are
at
the
opening
ah
so
much
the
better
said
henry
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
pale
face
now
said
la
mole
it
will
be
easier
this
garret
opens
on
to
a
stairway
the
stairway
leads
to
an
alley
and
the
alley
to
the
street
i
travelled
the
same
road
sire
on
a
much
more
terrible
night
than
this
go
on
go
on
said
henry
la
mole
sprang
through
the
open
window
reached
the
unlocked
door
opened
it
came
to
a
winding
stairway
and
placing
in
the
king
hand
the
cord
that
served
as
a
baluster
come
sire
said
he
half
way
down
the
stairs
henry
stopped
he
was
before
a
window
which
overlooked
the
courtyard
of
the
on
the
opposite
stairway
soldiers
were
seen
running
some
carrying
swords
others
torches
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
a
group
the
king
of
navarre
perceived
de
mouy
he
had
surrendered
his
sword
and
was
quietly
descending
the
stairs
poor
fellow
said
henry
so
brave
and
devoted
faith
sire
said
la
mole
your
majesty
is
right
he
certainly
does
seem
calm
and
see
he
even
laughs
it
must
be
that
he
is
planning
some
scheme
for
you
know
he
seldom
laughs
and
the
young
man
who
was
with
you
monsieur
de
coconnas
asked
la
mole
yes
what
has
become
of
him
oh
sire
i
am
not
anxious
about
him
on
seeing
the
soldiers
he
said
only
one
word
to
me
we
risk
anything
heads
i
answered
you
escape
hope
so
i
can
too
he
replied
and
i
promise
you
he
will
sire
when
coconnas
is
caught
it
will
be
because
he
wishes
to
be
caught
then
said
henry
all
is
well
let
us
try
to
get
back
to
the
louvre
that
will
be
easy
enough
sire
said
la
mole
let
us
wrap
ourselves
in
our
cloaks
and
start
the
street
is
full
of
people
running
to
see
the
commotion
and
we
shall
be
taken
for
spectators
the
gate
was
open
and
henry
and
la
mole
encountered
no
obstacle
beyond
the
crowds
in
the
street
they
reached
the
rue
but
in
passing
by
the
rue
poulies
they
saw
de
mouy
and
his
escort
cross
the
place
saint
germain
led
by
the
captain
of
the
guards
monsieur
de
nancey
ah
said
henry
they
are
taking
him
to
the
louvre
apparently
the
devil
the
gates
will
be
closed
they
will
take
the
names
of
all
those
who
enter
and
if
i
am
seen
returning
after
him
they
will
think
i
have
been
with
him
well
but
sire
said
la
mole
enter
some
other
way
than
by
the
gate
how
the
devil
do
you
mean
well
sire
there
is
the
queen
of
navarre
window
saint
monsieur
de
la
mole
said
henry
you
are
right
i
never
thought
of
that
but
how
can
i
attract
the
attention
of
the
queen
oh
said
la
mole
bowing
with
an
air
of
respectful
gratitude
your
majesty
throws
stones
so
well
chapter
xlvii
de
mouy
de
saint
phale
this
time
catharine
had
taken
such
precautions
that
she
felt
sure
of
her
object
consequently
about
ten
she
sent
away
marguerite
thoroughly
convinced
as
was
the
case
that
the
queen
of
navarre
was
ignorant
of
the
plot
against
her
husband
and
went
to
the
king
begging
him
not
to
retire
so
early
mystified
by
the
air
of
triumph
which
in
spite
of
her
usual
dissimulation
appeared
on
his
mother
face
charles
questioned
catharine
who
merely
answered
i
can
say
only
one
thing
to
your
majesty
that
this
evening
you
will
be
freed
from
two
of
your
bitterest
enemies
charles
raised
his
eyebrows
like
a
man
who
says
to
himself
that
is
well
we
shall
see
and
whistling
to
his
great
who
came
to
him
dragging
his
belly
along
the
ground
like
a
serpent
to
lay
his
fine
and
intelligent
head
on
his
master
knee
he
waited
at
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
during
which
catharine
sat
with
eyes
and
ears
alert
a
was
heard
in
the
courtyard
of
the
louvre
what
is
that
noise
asked
charles
frowning
while
the
hound
sprang
up
and
pricked
his
ears
nothing
except
a
signal
said
catharine
that
is
all
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
signal
it
means
that
from
this
moment
sire
your
one
real
enemy
can
no
longer
injure
you
have
they
killed
a
man
asked
charles
looking
at
his
mother
with
that
look
of
command
which
signifies
that
assassination
and
mercy
are
two
inherent
attributes
of
royal
power
no
sire
they
have
only
arrested
two
oh
murmured
charles
always
hidden
plots
always
conspiracies
around
the
king
and
yet
the
devil
mother
i
am
grown
up
and
big
enough
to
look
out
for
myself
i
need
neither
nor
padded
caps
go
to
poland
with
your
son
henry
if
you
wish
to
reign
i
tell
you
you
are
wrong
to
play
this
kind
of
game
here
my
son
said
catharine
this
is
the
last
time
i
shall
meddle
with
your
affairs
but
the
enterprise
in
which
you
have
always
thwarted
me
was
begun
long
ago
and
i
have
earnestly
endeavored
to
prove
to
your
majesty
that
i
am
right
at
that
moment
several
men
stopped
in
the
outer
hall
and
the
of
muskets
were
heard
on
the
pavement
almost
at
the
same
instant
monsieur
de
nancey
begged
an
audience
of
the
king
let
him
enter
said
charles
hastily
monsieur
de
nancey
appeared
saluted
the
king
and
turning
to
catharine
said
madame
your
majesty
orders
are
executed
he
is
captured
what
cried
catharine
greatly
troubled
have
you
arrested
only
one
he
was
alone
madame
did
he
defend
himself
no
he
was
supping
quietly
in
a
room
and
gave
up
his
sword
the
moment
it
was
demanded
who
asked
the
king
you
shall
see
said
catharine
bring
in
the
prisoner
monsieur
de
nancey
five
minutes
later
de
mouy
was
there
de
mouy
cried
the
king
what
is
the
matter
now
monsieur
well
sire
said
de
mouy
with
perfect
composure
if
your
majesty
will
allow
me
the
liberty
i
will
ask
the
same
of
you
instead
of
asking
this
question
of
the
king
said
catharine
have
the
kindness
monsieur
de
mouy
to
tell
my
son
who
was
the
man
found
in
the
chamber
of
the
king
of
navarre
a
certain
night
and
who
on
that
night
resisted
the
orders
of
his
majesty
like
the
rebel
that
he
is
killed
two
guards
and
wounded
monsieur
de
maurevel
yes
said
charles
frowning
do
you
know
the
name
of
that
man
monsieur
de
mouy
yes
sire
does
your
majesty
wish
to
hear
it
that
will
please
me
i
admit
well
sire
he
is
called
de
mouy
de
saint
phale
it
was
you
it
was
i
catharine
astonished
at
this
audacity
recoiled
a
step
how
did
you
dare
resist
the
orders
of
the
king
asked
charles
in
the
first
place
sire
i
did
not
know
that
there
was
an
order
from
your
majesty
then
i
saw
only
one
thing
or
rather
one
man
monsieur
de
maurevel
the
assassin
of
my
father
and
of
the
admiral
i
remembered
that
a
year
and
a
half
ago
in
the
very
room
in
which
we
now
are
on
the
evening
of
the
of
august
your
majesty
promised
me
to
avenge
us
on
the
murderer
and
as
since
that
time
very
grave
events
have
occurred
i
thought
that
in
spite
of
himself
the
king
had
changed
his
mind
seeing
maurevel
within
reach
i
believed
heaven
had
sent
him
to
me
your
majesty
knows
the
rest
sire
i
sprang
upon
him
as
upon
an
assassin
and
fired
at
his
men
as
i
would
have
fired
at
bandits
charles
made
no
reply
his
friendship
for
henry
had
for
some
time
made
him
look
at
many
things
in
a
different
light
from
which
he
had
at
first
seen
them
and
more
than
once
with
terror
in
regard
to
saint
bartholomew
the
queen
mother
had
registered
in
her
memory
remarks
which
had
fallen
from
her
son
lips
and
which
resembled
remorse
but
observed
catharine
what
were
you
doing
at
that
hour
in
the
apartments
of
the
king
of
navarre
oh
replied
de
mouy
it
is
a
long
story
but
if
his
majesty
has
the
patience
to
listen
yes
said
charles
speak
i
wish
to
hear
it
i
will
obey
sire
said
de
mouy
bowing
catharine
sat
down
fixing
an
anxious
look
on
the
young
chief
we
are
listening
said
charles
here
actéon
the
dog
resumed
the
place
he
had
occupied
before
the
prisoner
had
been
admitted
sire
said
de
mouy
i
came
to
his
majesty
the
king
of
navarre
as
the
deputy
of
our
brethren
your
faithful
subjects
of
the
reformed
religion
catharine
signed
to
charles
ix
be
quiet
mother
said
the
latter
i
do
not
lose
a
word
go
on
monsieur
de
mouy
go
on
why
did
you
come
to
inform
the
king
of
navarre
continued
monsieur
de
mouy
that
his
abjuration
had
lost
for
him
the
confidence
of
the
huguenot
party
but
that
nevertheless
in
remembrance
of
his
father
antoine
de
bourbon
and
especially
on
account
of
his
mother
the
courageous
jeanne
whose
name
is
dear
among
us
the
followers
of
the
reformed
religion
owed
him
this
mark
of
deference
to
beg
him
to
desist
from
his
claims
to
the
crown
of
navarre
what
did
he
say
asked
catharine
unable
in
spite
of
her
to
receive
this
unexpected
blow
calmly
ah
ah
said
charles
and
yet
this
crown
of
navarre
which
without
my
permission
has
been
made
to
jump
from
head
to
head
seems
to
belong
a
little
to
me
the
huguenots
sire
recognize
better
than
any
one
the
principle
of
sovereignty
to
which
your
majesty
has
just
referred
therefore
they
hope
to
induce
your
majesty
to
place
the
crown
on
a
head
that
is
dear
to
you
to
me
said
charles
on
a
head
that
is
dear
to
me
the
devil
what
head
do
you
mean
monsieur
i
do
not
understand
on
the
head
of
monsieur
le
duc
catharine
became
as
pale
as
death
and
gave
de
mouy
a
flashing
glance
did
my
brother
know
this
yes
sire
and
did
he
accept
the
crown
subject
to
the
consent
of
your
majesty
to
whom
he
referred
us
ah
said
charles
it
is
a
crown
which
would
suit
our
brother
wonderfully
well
and
i
never
thought
of
it
thanks
de
mouy
thanks
when
you
have
such
ideas
you
will
always
be
welcome
at
the
louvre
sire
you
would
long
since
have
been
informed
of
this
project
had
it
not
been
for
that
unfortunate
affair
of
maurevel
which
made
me
afraid
i
had
fallen
into
disgrace
with
your
majesty
yes
but
what
did
henry
say
to
this
plan
asked
catharine
the
king
of
navarre
madame
yielded
to
the
desire
of
his
brethren
and
his
renunciation
was
ready
in
that
case
said
catharine
you
must
have
the
renunciation
it
happens
that
i
have
it
with
me
madame
signed
by
him
and
dated
dated
previous
to
the
affair
in
the
louvre
said
catharine
yes
the
evening
before
i
think
de
mouy
drew
from
his
pocket
an
abdication
in
favor
of
the
duc
written
and
signed
in
henry
hand
and
bearing
the
date
indicated
faith
yes
said
charles
and
all
is
in
due
form
what
did
henry
demand
in
return
for
this
renunciation
nothing
madame
the
friendship
of
king
charles
he
told
us
would
amply
repay
him
for
the
loss
of
a
crown
catharine
bit
her
lips
in
anger
and
wrung
her
beautiful
hands
all
this
is
perfectly
correct
de
mouy
said
the
king
then
said
the
queen
mother
if
everything
was
settled
between
you
and
the
king
of
navarre
what
was
the
object
of
your
interview
with
him
this
evening
i
madame
with
the
king
of
navarre
said
de
mouy
monsieur
de
nancey
who
arrested
me
will
bear
witness
that
i
was
alone
your
majesty
can
ask
him
monsieur
de
nancey
called
the
king
the
captain
of
the
guards
entered
monsieur
de
nancey
said
catharine
quickly
was
monsieur
de
mouy
entirely
alone
at
the
inn
of
the
in
the
room
yes
madame
in
the
hostelry
no
ah
said
catharine
who
was
his
companion
i
do
not
know
if
he
was
the
companion
of
monsieur
de
mouy
madame
but
i
know
that
a
man
escaped
by
a
back
door
after
having
stretched
two
of
my
men
on
the
floor
and
you
recognized
this
gentleman
no
doubt
no
i
did
not
but
my
guards
did
who
was
he
asked
charles
ix
monsieur
le
comte
annibal
de
coconnas
annibal
de
coconnas
exclaimed
the
king
gloomy
and
thoughtful
the
one
who
made
such
a
terrible
slaughter
of
the
huguenots
during
the
massacre
of
saint
bartholomew
monsieur
de
coconnas
a
gentleman
in
the
suite
of
monsieur
said
monsieur
de
nancey
very
good
said
charles
ix
you
may
go
monsieur
de
nancey
and
another
time
remember
one
thing
what
is
it
sire
that
you
are
in
my
service
and
that
you
are
to
obey
no
one
but
me
monsieur
de
nancey
withdrew
backwards
bowing
respectfully
de
mouy
smiled
ironically
at
catharine
there
was
an
instant
silence
the
queen
twisted
the
tassels
of
her
girdle
charles
caressed
his
dog
but
what
was
your
intention
monsieur
continued
charles
were
you
acting
violently
against
whom
sire
why
against
henry
or
françois
or
myself
sire
we
have
the
renunciation
of
your
the
consent
of
your
brother
and
as
i
have
had
the
honor
of
telling
you
we
were
on
the
point
of
soliciting
your
majesty
sanction
when
that
unfortunate
affair
occurred
at
the
louvre
well
mother
said
charles
i
see
nothing
wrong
in
all
this
you
were
right
monsieur
de
mouy
in
asking
for
a
king
yes
navarre
may
and
ought
to
be
a
separate
kingdom
moreover
it
seems
made
expressly
to
give
to
my
brother
who
has
always
had
so
great
a
desire
for
a
crown
that
when
we
wear
ours
he
can
not
keep
his
eyes
off
of
it
the
only
thing
which
stood
in
the
way
of
this
coronation
was
henriot
rights
but
since
henriot
voluntarily
abdicates
voluntarily
sire
it
seems
that
it
is
the
will
of
god
monsieur
de
mouy
you
are
free
to
return
to
your
brethren
whom
i
have
chastised
somewhat
roughly
perhaps
but
that
is
between
god
and
myself
tell
them
that
since
they
desire
to
have
my
brother
for
king
of
navarre
the
king
of
france
accedes
to
their
wishes
from
this
moment
navarre
is
a
kingdom
and
its
sovereign
is
called
françois
i
ask
only
eight
days
for
my
brother
to
leave
paris
with
the
brilliancy
and
pomp
befitting
a
king
now
go
monsieur
de
mouy
go
monsieur
de
nancey
allow
monsieur
de
mouy
to
pass
he
is
free
sire
said
de
mouy
advancing
a
step
will
your
majesty
permit
me
yes
said
the
king
and
he
extended
his
hand
to
the
young
huguenot
de
mouy
knelt
and
kissed
the
king
hand
by
the
way
said
charles
detaining
him
as
he
was
about
to
rise
did
you
not
demand
from
me
justice
on
that
scoundrel
of
a
maurevel
yes
sire
i
do
not
know
where
he
is
as
he
is
hiding
but
if
you
meet
him
take
justice
into
your
own
hands
i
authorize
you
to
do
this
and
gladly
ah
sire
cried
de
mouy
your
majesty
overwhelms
me
your
majesty
may
rely
on
me
i
have
no
idea
where
he
is
but
i
will
find
him
you
may
rest
assured
de
mouy
respectfully
saluted
king
charles
and
queen
catharine
and
withdrew
without
hindrance
from
the
guards
who
had
brought
him
thither
he
passed
rapidly
through
the
corridors
reached
the
gate
and
once
outside
hurried
to
place
saint
germain
to
the
inn
of
the
here
he
found
his
horse
thanks
to
which
three
hours
after
the
scene
we
have
just
described
the
young
man
breathed
in
safety
behind
the
walls
of
mantes
catharine
consumed
with
rage
returned
to
her
apartments
whence
she
passed
into
those
of
marguerite
she
found
henry
there
in
his
apparently
ready
for
bed
satan
she
murmured
aid
a
poor
queen
for
whom
god
will
do
nothing
more
chapter
xlviii
two
heads
for
one
crown
ask
monsieur
to
come
to
me
said
charles
as
he
dismissed
his
mother
monsieur
de
nancey
in
accordance
with
the
remark
of
the
king
that
henceforth
he
was
to
obey
him
alone
hastened
to
the
duke
apartments
and
delivered
word
for
word
the
order
he
had
just
received
the
duc
gave
a
start
he
had
always
feared
charles
and
now
more
than
ever
since
by
conspiring
he
had
reason
to
be
afraid
nevertheless
he
went
to
his
brother
in
all
haste
charles
was
standing
up
whistling
a
as
he
entered
the
duc
caught
from
the
glassy
eye
of
the
king
one
of
those
bitter
looks
of
hatred
which
he
knew
so
well
your
majesty
has
sent
for
me
said
he
here
i
am
what
does
your
majesty
desire
i
desire
to
tell
you
my
good
brother
that
as
a
reward
for
the
great
friendship
you
bear
me
i
have
decided
to
do
for
you
the
thing
you
most
want
for
me
yes
for
you
think
what
for
some
time
you
have
been
dreaming
of
without
daring
to
ask
it
of
me
and
i
will
give
it
to
you
sire
said
françois
i
swear
to
you
that
i
desire
nothing
but
the
continued
good
health
of
the
king
in
that
case
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
the
indisposition
i
experienced
at
the
time
the
poles
arrived
has
passed
by
thanks
to
henriot
i
escaped
a
furious
wild
boar
which
would
have
ripped
me
open
and
i
am
so
well
that
i
do
not
envy
the
most
healthy
man
in
my
kingdom
without
being
an
unkind
brother
you
can
therefore
ask
for
something
besides
the
continuation
of
my
health
which
is
excellent
i
want
nothing
sire
yes
yes
françois
said
charles
impatiently
you
desire
the
crown
of
navarre
since
you
have
had
an
understanding
with
henriot
and
de
mouy
with
the
first
that
he
would
abdicate
with
the
second
that
he
would
give
it
to
you
well
henriot
renounces
it
de
mouy
has
told
me
of
your
wish
and
this
crown
for
which
you
are
ambitious
well
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
well
the
devil
it
is
yours
turned
frightfully
pale
then
suddenly
the
blood
rushed
from
his
heart
which
almost
burst
flowed
to
his
face
and
his
cheeks
became
suffused
with
a
burning
flush
the
favor
the
king
granted
him
at
that
moment
threw
him
into
despair
but
sire
said
he
trembling
with
emotion
and
trying
in
vain
to
recover
his
i
never
desired
and
certainly
never
asked
for
such
a
thing
that
is
possible
said
the
king
for
you
are
very
discreet
brother
but
it
has
been
desired
and
asked
for
you
sire
i
swear
to
you
that
never
do
not
swear
but
sire
are
you
going
to
exile
me
then
do
you
call
this
exile
françois
plague
it
you
are
hard
to
please
what
better
do
you
hope
for
bit
his
lips
in
despair
faith
continued
charles
affecting
kindness
i
did
not
think
you
were
so
popular
françois
especially
with
the
huguenots
but
they
have
sought
you
and
i
have
to
confess
to
myself
that
i
was
mistaken
besides
i
could
ask
nothing
better
than
to
have
one
of
my
family
my
brother
who
loves
me
and
who
is
incapable
of
betraying
me
at
the
head
of
a
party
which
for
thirty
years
has
made
war
against
us
this
will
quell
everything
as
if
by
enchantment
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
we
shall
all
be
kings
in
the
family
there
will
be
no
one
except
poor
henriot
who
will
be
nothing
but
my
friend
but
he
is
not
ambitious
and
he
shall
take
this
title
which
no
one
else
claims
oh
sire
you
are
mistaken
i
claim
this
title
and
who
has
a
better
right
to
it
than
i
henry
is
only
your
brother
by
marriage
i
am
your
brother
by
blood
and
more
than
this
my
love
sire
i
beg
you
keep
me
near
you
no
no
françois
replied
charles
that
would
be
to
your
unhappiness
how
so
for
many
reasons
but
sire
shall
you
ever
find
as
faithful
a
companion
as
i
am
from
my
childhood
i
have
never
left
your
majesty
i
know
that
very
well
and
sometimes
i
have
wished
you
farther
away
what
does
your
majesty
mean
nothing
nothing
i
understand
myself
oh
what
fine
hunts
you
will
have
there
françois
how
i
envy
you
do
you
know
that
in
those
devilish
mountains
they
hunt
the
bear
as
here
we
do
the
wild
boar
you
will
send
us
all
such
magnificent
skins
they
hunt
there
with
a
dagger
you
know
they
wait
for
the
animal
excite
him
irritate
him
he
advances
towards
the
hunter
and
when
within
four
feet
of
him
he
rises
on
his
hind
legs
it
is
then
that
they
plunge
the
steel
into
his
heart
as
henry
did
to
the
boar
at
our
last
hunt
it
is
dangerous
sport
but
you
are
brave
françois
and
the
danger
will
be
a
real
pleasure
for
you
ah
your
majesty
increases
my
grief
for
i
shall
hunt
with
you
no
more
by
heaven
so
much
the
better
said
the
king
it
helps
neither
of
us
to
hunt
together
what
does
your
majesty
mean
that
hunting
with
me
causes
you
such
pleasure
and
rouses
in
you
such
emotion
that
you
who
are
the
personification
of
skill
you
who
with
any
musket
can
bring
down
a
magpie
a
hundred
feet
away
the
last
time
we
hunted
together
failed
at
twenty
paces
to
hit
a
wild
boar
but
with
your
weapon
a
weapon
too
with
which
you
are
familiar
you
broke
the
leg
of
my
best
horse
the
devil
françois
that
makes
one
reflect
you
know
oh
sire
pardon
me
it
was
from
emotion
said
who
had
become
livid
yes
replied
charles
i
can
well
imagine
what
the
emotion
was
and
it
is
on
account
of
this
emotion
that
i
realize
all
that
it
means
when
i
say
to
you
me
françois
when
one
has
such
emotions
it
is
best
for
us
to
hunt
at
a
distance
from
each
other
think
about
it
brother
not
while
you
are
with
me
because
i
can
see
my
presence
troubles
you
but
when
you
are
alone
and
you
will
see
that
i
have
every
reason
to
fear
that
in
another
hunt
you
might
be
seized
with
another
emotion
there
is
nothing
like
emotion
for
causing
the
hand
to
rise
and
you
might
kill
the
rider
instead
of
the
horse
the
king
instead
of
the
beast
plague
it
a
bullet
aimed
too
high
or
too
low
changes
an
entire
government
we
have
an
example
of
this
in
our
own
family
when
montgommery
killed
our
father
henry
by
accident
emotion
perhaps
the
blow
placed
our
brother
françois
on
the
throne
and
sent
our
father
henry
to
saint
denis
so
little
is
necessary
for
providence
to
effect
much
the
duke
felt
the
perspiration
running
down
his
face
at
this
attack
as
formidable
as
it
was
unforeseen
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
king
to
show
more
clearly
that
he
had
surmised
all
veiling
his
anger
under
a
jesting
manner
charles
was
perhaps
more
terrible
than
as
if
he
had
let
himself
pour
forth
the
lava
of
hate
which
was
consuming
his
heart
his
vengeance
seemed
in
proportion
to
his
rancor
as
the
one
grew
sharper
the
other
increased
and
for
the
first
time
felt
remorse
or
rather
regret
for
having
meditated
a
crime
which
had
not
succeeded
he
had
sustained
the
struggle
as
long
as
he
could
but
at
this
final
blow
he
bent
his
head
and
charles
saw
dawning
in
his
eyes
that
devouring
fire
which
in
beings
of
a
tender
nature
ploughs
the
furrow
from
which
spring
tears
but
was
one
of
those
who
weep
only
from
anger
charles
fixed
on
him
his
vulture
gaze
watching
the
feelings
which
succeeded
one
another
across
the
face
of
the
young
man
and
all
those
sensations
appeared
to
him
as
accurately
thanks
to
the
deep
study
he
had
made
of
his
family
as
if
the
heart
of
the
duke
had
been
an
open
book
he
left
him
a
moment
crushed
motionless
and
mute
then
in
a
voice
stamped
with
the
firmness
of
hatred
brother
said
he
we
have
declared
to
you
our
resolution
it
is
immutable
you
will
go
gave
a
start
but
charles
did
not
appear
to
notice
it
and
continued
i
wish
navarre
to
be
proud
of
having
for
king
a
brother
of
the
king
of
france
gold
power
honor
all
that
belongs
to
your
birth
you
shall
have
as
your
brother
henry
had
and
like
him
he
added
smiling
you
will
bless
me
from
afar
but
no
matter
blessings
know
no
distance
sire
accept
my
decision
or
rather
resign
yourself
once
king
we
shall
find
a
wife
for
you
worthy
of
a
son
of
france
and
she
perhaps
may
bring
you
another
throne
but
said
the
duc
your
majesty
forgets
your
good
friend
henry
henry
but
i
told
you
that
he
did
not
want
the
throne
of
navarre
i
told
you
he
had
abdicated
in
favor
of
you
henry
is
a
jovial
fellow
and
not
a
like
you
he
likes
to
laugh
and
amuse
himself
at
his
ease
and
not
mope
as
we
who
wear
crowns
are
condemned
to
do
heaved
a
sigh
your
majesty
orders
me
then
to
occupy
myself
no
not
at
all
do
not
disturb
yourself
at
all
i
will
arrange
everything
rely
on
me
as
on
a
good
brother
and
now
that
everything
is
settled
go
however
not
a
word
of
our
conversation
to
your
friends
i
will
take
measures
to
give
publicity
to
the
affair
very
soon
go
now
françois
there
was
nothing
further
to
be
said
so
the
duke
bowed
and
withdrew
rage
in
his
heart
he
was
very
anxious
to
find
henry
and
talk
with
him
about
all
that
had
just
taken
place
but
he
found
only
catharine
as
a
matter
of
fact
henry
wished
to
avoid
the
interview
whereas
the
latter
sought
for
it
on
seeing
catharine
the
duke
swallowed
his
anger
and
strove
to
smile
less
fortunate
than
henry
of
anjou
it
was
not
a
mother
he
sought
in
catharine
but
merely
an
ally
he
began
therefore
by
dissimulation
for
in
order
to
make
good
alliances
it
is
necessary
for
each
party
to
be
somewhat
deceived
he
met
catharine
with
a
face
on
which
there
remained
only
a
slight
trace
of
anxiety
well
madame
said
he
here
is
great
news
have
you
heard
it
i
know
that
there
is
a
plan
on
hand
to
make
a
king
of
you
monsieur
it
is
a
great
kindness
on
the
part
of
my
brother
madame
is
it
not
and
i
am
almost
tempted
to
believe
that
i
owe
a
part
of
my
gratitude
to
you
for
it
was
really
you
who
advised
charles
to
make
me
the
present
of
a
throne
it
is
to
you
i
owe
it
however
i
will
confess
that
at
heart
it
gives
me
pain
thus
to
rob
the
king
of
navarre
you
love
henriot
very
much
apparently
why
yes
we
have
been
intimate
for
some
time
do
you
think
he
loves
you
as
much
as
you
love
him
i
hope
so
madame
such
a
friendship
is
very
edifying
do
you
know
it
especially
between
princes
court
friendships
mean
very
little
françois
mother
you
must
remember
we
are
not
only
friends
but
almost
brothers
catharine
smiled
a
strange
smile
ah
said
she
are
there
brothers
among
kings
oh
as
to
that
neither
of
us
was
a
king
mother
when
our
intimacy
began
moreover
we
never
expected
to
be
kings
that
is
why
we
loved
each
other
yes
but
things
are
changed
how
changed
why
who
can
say
now
whether
both
of
you
will
not
be
kings
from
the
nervous
start
of
the
duke
and
the
flush
which
rose
to
his
brow
catharine
saw
that
the
arrow
aimed
by
her
had
hit
the
mark
he
said
he
henriot
king
and
of
what
kingdom
mother
one
of
the
most
magnificent
kingdoms
in
christendom
my
son
oh
mother
said
growing
pale
what
are
you
saying
what
a
good
mother
ought
to
say
to
her
son
and
what
you
have
thought
of
more
than
once
françois
i
said
the
duke
i
have
thought
of
nothing
madame
i
swear
to
you
i
can
well
believe
you
for
your
friend
your
brother
henry
as
you
call
him
is
under
his
apparent
frankness
a
very
clever
and
wily
person
who
keeps
his
secrets
better
than
you
keep
yours
françois
for
instance
did
he
ever
tell
you
that
de
mouy
was
his
man
of
business
as
she
spoke
catharine
turned
a
glance
upon
françois
as
though
it
were
a
dagger
aimed
at
his
very
soul
but
the
latter
had
but
one
virtue
or
rather
vice
the
art
of
dissimulation
and
he
bore
her
look
unflinchingly
de
mouy
said
he
in
surprise
as
if
it
were
the
first
time
he
had
heard
the
name
mentioned
in
that
connection
yes
the
huguenot
de
mouy
de
saint
phale
the
one
who
nearly
killed
monsieur
de
maurevel
and
who
secretly
and
in
various
disguises
is
running
all
over
france
and
the
capital
intriguing
and
raising
an
army
to
support
your
brother
henry
against
your
family
catharine
ignorant
that
on
this
point
her
son
françois
knew
as
much
if
not
more
than
she
rose
at
these
words
and
started
majestically
to
leave
the
room
but
françois
detained
her
mother
said
he
another
word
if
you
please
since
you
deign
to
initiate
me
into
your
politics
tell
me
how
with
his
feeble
resources
and
being
so
slightly
known
henry
could
succeed
in
carrying
on
a
war
serious
enough
to
disturb
my
family
child
said
the
queen
smiling
he
is
supported
by
perhaps
more
than
thirty
thousand
men
he
has
but
to
say
the
word
and
these
thirty
thousand
men
will
appear
as
suddenly
as
if
they
sprang
from
the
ground
and
these
thirty
thousand
men
are
huguenots
remember
that
is
the
bravest
soldiers
in
the
world
and
then
he
has
a
protector
whom
you
neither
could
nor
would
conciliate
who
is
that
he
has
the
king
the
king
who
loves
him
and
who
urges
him
on
the
king
who
from
jealousy
of
your
brother
of
poland
and
from
spite
against
you
is
looking
about
for
a
successor
but
blind
man
that
you
are
if
you
do
not
see
it
he
seeks
somewhere
else
besides
in
his
own
family
the
king
you
think
so
mother
have
you
not
noticed
how
he
loves
henriot
his
henriot
yes
mother
yes
and
how
he
is
repaid
for
this
same
henriot
forgetting
that
his
would
have
shot
him
at
the
massacre
of
saint
bartholomew
grovels
to
the
earth
like
a
dog
which
licks
the
hand
that
has
beaten
him
yes
yes
murmured
françois
i
have
already
noticed
that
henry
is
very
humble
with
my
brother
charles
clever
in
trying
to
please
him
in
everything
so
much
so
that
because
of
being
always
rallied
by
the
king
as
to
his
ignorance
of
hawking
he
has
begun
to
study
it
and
yesterday
yes
it
was
only
yesterday
he
asked
me
if
i
had
not
some
books
on
that
sport
well
said
catharine
whose
eyes
sparkled
as
if
an
idea
had
suddenly
come
to
her
what
did
you
answer
him
that
i
would
look
in
my
library
good
said
catharine
he
must
have
this
book
but
i
looked
madame
and
found
nothing
i
will
find
one
and
you
shall
give
it
to
him
as
though
it
came
from
you
and
what
will
come
of
this
have
you
confidence
in
me
yes
mother
will
you
obey
me
blindly
so
far
as
henry
is
concerned
for
whatever
you
may
have
said
you
do
not
love
him
smiled
and
i
detest
him
continued
catharine
yes
i
will
obey
you
well
the
day
after
come
here
for
the
book
i
will
give
it
to
you
you
shall
take
it
to
henry
and
and
leave
the
rest
to
providence
or
to
chance
françois
knew
his
mother
well
enough
to
realize
that
she
was
not
in
the
habit
of
leaving
to
providence
or
to
chance
the
care
of
friendships
or
hatreds
but
he
said
nothing
and
bowing
like
a
man
who
accepts
the
commission
with
which
he
is
charged
he
returned
to
his
own
apartments
what
does
she
mean
thought
the
young
man
as
he
mounted
the
stairs
i
can
not
see
but
what
i
do
understand
in
all
this
is
that
she
acts
like
our
common
enemy
well
let
her
go
ahead
meantime
marguerite
through
la
mole
had
received
a
letter
from
de
mouy
to
the
king
of
navarre
as
in
politics
the
two
illustrious
allies
had
no
secrets
she
opened
the
letter
and
read
it
the
letter
must
have
interested
her
for
taking
advantage
of
the
darkness
which
was
beginning
to
overshadow
the
walls
of
the
louvre
marguerite
at
once
hurried
along
the
secret
corridor
ascended
the
winding
stairway
and
having
looked
carefully
about
on
all
sides
glided
on
like
a
shadow
and
disappeared
within
the
antechamber
of
the
king
of
navarre
this
room
had
been
unguarded
since
the
disappearance
of
orthon
this
circumstance
of
which
we
have
not
spoken
since
the
reader
learned
of
the
tragic
fate
of
poor
orthon
had
greatly
troubled
henry
he
had
spoken
of
it
to
madame
de
sauve
and
to
his
wife
but
neither
of
them
knew
any
more
about
it
than
he
did
madame
de
sauve
had
given
him
some
information
from
which
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
henry
mind
that
the
poor
boy
had
been
a
victim
of
some
machination
of
the
queen
mother
and
that
this
was
why
he
himself
had
been
interrupted
with
de
mouy
in
the
inn
of
the
any
other
than
henry
would
have
kept
silence
fearing
to
speak
but
henry
calculated
everything
he
realized
that
his
silence
would
betray
him
one
does
not
as
a
rule
lose
one
servitor
and
confidant
thus
without
making
inquiries
about
him
and
looking
for
him
so
henry
asked
and
searched
even
in
the
presence
of
the
king
and
the
queen
mother
and
of
every
one
from
the
sentinel
who
walked
before
the
gate
of
the
louvre
to
the
captain
of
the
guards
keeping
watch
in
the
antechamber
of
the
king
but
all
inquiry
and
search
was
in
vain
and
henry
seemed
so
affected
by
the
circumstance
and
so
attached
to
the
poor
absent
servitor
that
he
said
he
would
not
put
another
in
his
place
until
he
was
perfectly
sure
that
orthon
had
disappeared
forever
so
the
antechamber
as
we
have
said
was
empty
when
marguerite
reached
it
light
as
were
the
steps
of
the
queen
henry
heard
them
and
turned
round
you
madame
he
exclaimed
yes
said
marguerite
quick
read
this
and
she
handed
him
the
open
letter
it
contained
these
lines
the
moment
has
come
for
putting
our
plan
of
flight
into
execution
the
day
after
there
will
be
hunting
along
the
seine
from
saint
germain
to
maisons
that
is
all
along
the
to
the
hunt
although
it
is
hawking
wear
a
good
coat
of
mail
under
your
suit
take
your
best
sword
and
ride
the
best
horse
in
your
stable
about
noon
when
the
chase
is
at
its
height
and
the
king
is
galloping
after
the
falcon
escape
alone
if
you
come
alone
with
the
queen
of
navarre
if
the
queen
will
follow
of
our
men
will
be
hidden
in
the
pavilion
of
françois
of
which
we
have
the
key
no
one
will
know
that
they
will
be
there
for
they
will
have
come
at
night
and
the
shutters
will
be
will
pass
by
the
alley
of
the
violettes
at
the
end
of
which
i
shall
be
watching
at
the
right
of
this
alley
in
an
open
space
will
be
messieurs
de
la
mole
and
coconnas
with
two
horses
these
horses
are
intended
to
replace
yours
and
that
of
her
majesty
the
queen
of
navarre
if
sire
be
ready
as
we
shall
you
will
be
said
marguerite
uttering
after
sixteen
hundred
years
the
same
words
that
cæsar
spoke
on
the
banks
of
the
rubicon
be
it
so
madame
replied
henry
i
will
not
fail
you
now
sire
be
a
hero
it
is
not
difficult
you
have
but
to
follow
the
path
that
is
indicated
and
make
a
beautiful
throne
for
me
said
the
daughter
of
henry
ii
an
imperceptible
smile
rose
to
the
thin
lips
of
the
béarnais
he
kissed
marguerite
hand
and
went
out
to
explore
the
corridor
whistling
the
refrain
of
an
old
song
qui
mieux
battit
la
pas
dedans
le
the
precaution
was
wise
for
just
as
he
opened
the
door
of
his
the
duc
opened
that
of
his
antechamber
henry
motioned
to
marguerite
and
then
aloud
said
ah
is
it
you
brother
welcome
at
the
sign
from
her
husband
the
queen
had
understood
everything
and
stepped
hurriedly
into
a
in
front
of
the
door
of
which
hung
a
thick
tapestry
the
duc
entered
with
a
timorous
step
and
looked
around
him
are
we
alone
brother
asked
he
in
a
whisper
entirely
but
what
is
the
matter
you
seem
disturbed
we
are
discovered
henry
how
discovered
yes
de
mouy
has
been
arrested
i
know
it
well
de
mouy
has
told
the
king
all
what
has
he
told
him
he
has
told
him
that
i
desire
the
throne
of
navarre
and
that
i
have
conspired
to
obtain
it
ah
the
stupid
cried
henry
so
that
now
you
are
compromised
my
poor
brother
how
is
it
then
that
you
have
not
been
arrested
i
do
not
know
the
king
joked
with
me
by
pretending
to
offer
me
the
throne
of
navarre
he
hoped
no
doubt
to
draw
some
confession
from
me
but
i
said
nothing
and
you
did
well
saint
said
the
béarnais
stand
firm
for
our
lives
depend
on
that
yes
said
françois
the
position
is
unsafe
i
know
that
is
why
i
came
to
ask
your
advice
brother
what
do
you
think
i
ought
to
do
run
or
stay
you
must
have
seen
the
king
since
he
spoke
to
you
yes
of
course
well
you
must
have
read
his
thoughts
so
follow
your
inspiration
i
prefer
to
remain
replied
françois
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
was
almost
thorough
master
of
himself
henry
could
not
prevent
a
movement
of
joy
from
escaping
him
and
slight
as
it
was
françois
saw
it
remain
then
said
henry
but
you
why
replied
henry
if
you
remain
i
have
no
motive
for
leaving
i
was
going
only
to
follow
you
from
devotion
in
order
not
to
be
separated
from
my
brother
so
said
there
is
an
end
to
all
our
plans
you
give
up
without
a
struggle
at
the
first
stroke
of
ill
luck
i
do
not
look
upon
it
as
a
stroke
of
ill
luck
to
remain
here
said
henry
thanks
to
my
careless
disposition
i
am
contented
everywhere
well
then
said
we
need
say
no
more
about
it
only
in
case
you
decide
anything
different
let
me
know
by
heaven
i
shall
not
fail
to
do
that
you
may
be
sure
replied
henry
was
it
not
agreed
that
we
were
to
have
no
secrets
from
each
other
said
no
more
but
withdrew
pondering
however
for
at
one
time
he
thought
he
had
seen
the
tapestry
in
front
of
the
closet
move
scarcely
was
the
duke
gone
when
the
curtain
was
raised
and
marguerite
reappeared
what
do
you
think
of
this
visit
asked
henry
that
there
is
something
new
and
important
on
hand
what
do
you
think
it
is
i
do
not
know
yet
but
i
will
find
out
in
the
meanwhile
in
the
meanwhile
do
not
fail
to
come
to
my
room
evening
indeed
i
will
not
fail
madame
said
henry
gallantly
kissing
the
hand
of
his
wife
with
the
same
caution
she
had
used
in
coming
marguerite
returned
to
her
own
apartments
chapter
xlix
the
treatise
on
hunting
three
days
had
elapsed
since
the
events
we
have
just
related
day
was
beginning
to
dawn
but
every
one
was
already
up
and
awake
at
the
louvre
as
usual
on
hunting
days
when
the
duc
entered
the
apartments
of
the
queen
mother
in
answer
to
the
invitation
he
had
received
catharine
was
not
in
her
bedroom
but
she
had
left
orders
that
if
her
son
came
he
was
to
wait
for
her
at
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
she
came
out
of
a
private
closet
to
which
no
one
but
herself
had
admission
and
in
which
she
carried
on
her
experiments
in
chemistry
as
catharine
entered
the
room
there
came
either
from
the
closet
or
from
her
clothes
the
penetrating
odor
of
some
acrid
perfume
and
through
the
open
door
perceived
a
thick
vapor
as
of
some
burnt
aromatic
substance
floating
in
the
laboratory
like
a
white
cloud
the
duke
could
not
repress
a
glance
of
curiosity
yes
said
catharine
de
médicis
i
have
been
burning
several
old
parchments
which
gave
out
such
an
offensive
smell
that
i
put
some
juniper
into
the
brazier
hence
this
odor
bowed
well
said
the
queen
concealing
under
the
wide
sleeves
of
her
her
hands
which
here
and
there
were
stained
with
reddish
spots
is
there
anything
new
since
yesterday
nothing
mother
have
you
seen
henry
yes
does
he
still
refuse
to
leave
absolutely
the
knave
what
do
you
say
madame
i
say
that
he
will
go
you
think
so
i
am
sure
of
it
then
he
will
escape
us
yes
said
catharine
and
shall
you
let
him
go
not
only
that
but
i
tell
you
he
must
go
i
do
not
understand
mother
listen
well
to
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you
françois
a
very
skilful
physician
the
one
who
let
me
take
the
book
on
hunting
which
you
are
to
give
him
has
told
me
that
the
king
of
navarre
is
on
the
point
of
being
attacked
with
consumption
one
of
those
incurable
diseases
for
which
science
has
no
remedy
now
you
understand
that
if
he
has
to
die
from
such
a
cruel
malady
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
die
away
from
us
than
among
us
here
at
court
in
fact
said
the
duke
that
would
cause
us
too
much
pain
especially
your
brother
charles
said
catharine
whereas
if
he
dies
after
having
betrayed
him
the
king
will
regard
his
death
as
a
punishment
from
heaven
you
are
right
mother
said
françois
in
admiration
he
must
leave
but
are
you
sure
that
he
will
all
his
plans
are
made
the
is
in
the
forest
of
saint
germain
fifty
huguenots
are
to
escort
him
as
far
as
fontainebleau
where
five
hundred
others
will
await
him
and
said
with
a
slight
hesitation
and
visible
pallor
will
my
sister
margot
accompany
him
yes
replied
catharine
that
is
agreed
on
but
at
henry
death
margot
is
to
return
to
court
a
widow
and
free
and
henry
will
die
madame
are
you
sure
of
this
the
physician
who
gave
me
the
book
assured
me
of
it
where
is
this
book
madame
catharine
went
slowly
towards
the
mysterious
closet
opened
the
door
entered
and
a
moment
later
appeared
with
the
book
in
her
hand
here
it
is
said
she
looked
at
the
volume
with
a
certain
feeling
of
terror
what
is
this
book
madame
he
asked
shuddering
i
have
already
told
you
my
son
it
is
a
treatise
on
the
art
of
raising
and
training
falcons
gerfalcons
and
hawks
written
by
a
very
learned
scholar
for
lord
castruccio
castracani
tyrant
of
lucca
what
must
i
do
with
it
take
it
to
your
good
friend
henriot
who
you
told
me
had
asked
you
for
a
treatise
on
the
art
of
hunting
as
he
is
going
hawking
with
the
king
he
will
not
fail
to
read
some
of
it
in
order
to
prove
to
charles
that
he
has
followed
his
advice
and
taken
a
lesson
or
two
the
main
thing
is
to
give
it
into
henry
own
hands
oh
i
do
not
dare
said
shuddering
why
not
asked
catharine
it
is
a
book
like
any
other
except
that
it
has
been
packed
away
for
so
long
that
the
leaves
stick
together
do
not
attempt
to
read
it
françois
for
it
can
be
read
only
by
wetting
the
finger
and
turning
over
each
leaf
and
this
takes
time
and
trouble
so
that
only
a
man
who
is
very
anxious
to
be
instructed
in
the
sport
of
hawking
would
waste
his
time
and
go
to
this
trouble
asked
exactly
my
son
you
understand
oh
said
there
is
henriot
in
the
give
me
the
book
madame
i
will
take
advantage
of
his
absence
and
go
to
his
room
with
it
on
his
return
he
will
find
it
i
should
prefer
you
to
give
it
to
him
yourself
françois
that
would
be
surer
i
have
already
said
that
i
do
not
dare
madame
replied
the
duke
very
well
but
at
least
put
it
where
he
can
see
it
open
is
there
any
reason
why
it
should
not
be
open
none
then
give
it
to
me
tremblingly
took
the
book
which
catharine
with
a
firm
hand
held
out
to
him
take
it
said
the
queen
there
is
no
danger
i
touch
it
besides
you
have
gloves
on
this
precaution
was
not
enough
for
who
wrapped
the
volume
in
his
cloak
make
haste
said
catharine
henry
may
return
at
any
moment
you
are
right
madame
i
will
go
at
once
the
duke
went
out
trembling
with
fright
we
have
often
introduced
the
reader
into
the
apartments
of
the
king
of
navarre
and
he
has
been
present
at
the
events
which
have
taken
place
in
them
events
bright
or
gloomy
according
to
the
smile
or
frown
of
the
protecting
genius
of
the
future
king
of
france
but
perhaps
never
had
these
walls
stained
with
the
blood
of
murders
sprinkled
with
the
wine
of
orgies
scented
with
the
perfumes
of
love
perhaps
never
had
this
corner
of
the
louvre
seen
a
paler
face
than
that
of
the
duc
as
with
book
in
hand
he
opened
the
door
of
the
bedchamber
of
the
king
of
navarre
and
no
one
as
the
duke
had
expected
was
in
the
room
to
question
with
curious
or
anxious
glances
what
he
was
about
to
do
the
first
rays
of
the
morning
sun
alone
were
lighting
up
the
vacant
chamber
on
the
wall
in
readiness
hung
the
sword
which
monsieur
de
mouy
had
advised
henry
to
take
with
him
some
links
of
a
coat
of
mail
were
scattered
on
the
floor
a
purse
and
a
small
dagger
lay
on
a
table
and
some
light
ashes
in
the
fireplace
joined
to
the
other
evidence
clearly
showed
that
the
king
of
navarre
had
put
on
the
shirt
of
mail
collected
some
money
from
his
treasurer
and
burned
all
papers
that
might
compromise
him
my
mother
was
not
mistaken
said
the
knave
would
have
betrayed
me
doubtless
this
conviction
gave
added
strength
to
the
young
man
he
sounded
the
corners
of
the
room
at
a
glance
raised
the
portieres
and
realizing
from
the
loud
noise
in
the
below
and
the
dense
silence
in
the
apartments
that
no
one
was
there
to
spy
on
him
he
drew
the
book
from
under
his
cloak
hastily
laid
it
on
the
table
near
the
purse
propping
it
up
against
a
desk
of
sculptured
oak
then
drawing
back
he
reached
out
his
arm
and
with
a
hesitation
which
betrayed
his
fears
with
his
gloved
hand
he
opened
the
volume
to
an
engraving
of
a
hunt
this
done
again
stepped
back
and
drawing
off
his
glove
threw
it
into
the
still
warm
fire
which
had
just
consumed
the
papers
the
supple
leather
crackled
over
the
coals
twisted
and
flattened
itself
out
like
the
body
of
a
great
reptile
leaving
nothing
but
a
burned
and
blackened
lump
waited
until
the
flame
had
consumed
the
glove
then
rolling
up
the
cloak
which
had
been
wrapped
around
the
book
he
put
it
under
his
arm
and
hastily
returned
to
his
own
apartments
as
he
entered
with
beating
heart
he
heard
steps
on
the
winding
stairs
and
not
doubting
but
that
it
was
henry
he
quickly
closed
his
door
then
he
stepped
to
the
window
but
he
could
see
only
a
part
of
the
of
the
louvre
henry
was
not
there
however
and
he
felt
convinced
that
it
was
the
king
of
navarre
who
had
just
returned
the
duke
sat
down
opened
a
book
and
tried
to
read
it
was
a
history
of
france
from
pharamond
to
henry
for
which
a
few
days
after
his
accession
to
the
throne
henry
had
given
a
license
but
the
duke
thoughts
were
not
on
what
he
was
reading
the
fever
of
expectation
burned
in
his
veins
his
temples
throbbed
clear
to
his
brain
and
as
in
a
dream
or
some
magnetic
trance
it
seemed
to
françois
that
he
could
see
through
the
walls
his
eyes
appeared
to
probe
into
henry
chamber
in
spite
of
the
obstacles
between
in
order
to
drive
away
the
terrible
object
before
his
mind
eye
the
duke
strove
to
fix
his
attention
on
something
besides
the
terrible
book
opened
on
the
oak
desk
but
in
vain
he
looked
at
his
weapons
his
ornaments
in
vain
he
gazed
a
hundred
times
at
the
same
spot
on
the
floor
every
detail
of
the
picture
at
which
he
had
merely
glanced
remained
graven
on
his
memory
it
consisted
of
a
gentleman
on
horseback
fulfilling
the
duties
of
a
beater
of
hawking
throwing
the
bait
calling
to
the
falcon
and
galloping
through
the
deep
grass
of
a
swamp
strong
as
was
the
duke
will
his
memory
triumphed
over
it
then
it
was
not
only
the
book
he
saw
but
the
king
of
navarre
approaching
it
looking
at
the
picture
trying
to
turn
the
pages
finally
wetting
his
thumb
and
forcing
the
leaves
apart
at
this
sight
fictitious
and
imaginary
as
it
was
staggered
and
was
forced
to
lean
one
hand
against
a
table
while
with
the
other
he
covered
his
eyes
as
if
by
so
doing
he
did
not
see
more
clearly
than
before
the
vision
he
wished
to
escape
this
vision
was
in
his
own
thoughts
suddenly
saw
henry
cross
the
court
he
stopped
a
few
moments
before
the
men
who
were
loading
two
mules
with
the
provisions
for
the
chase
none
other
than
the
money
and
other
things
he
wished
to
take
with
him
then
having
given
his
orders
he
crossed
the
court
diagonally
and
advanced
towards
the
door
stood
motionless
it
was
not
henry
then
who
had
mounted
the
secret
staircase
all
the
agony
he
had
undergone
during
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
had
been
useless
what
he
thought
was
over
or
almost
over
was
only
beginning
françois
opened
the
door
of
his
chamber
then
holding
it
so
he
listened
this
time
he
could
not
be
mistaken
it
was
henry
himself
he
recognized
his
step
and
the
peculiar
jingle
of
his
spurs
henry
door
opened
and
closed
returned
to
his
room
and
sank
into
an
armchair
good
said
he
this
is
what
is
now
taking
place
he
has
passed
through
the
antechamber
the
first
room
the
then
he
glances
to
see
if
his
sword
his
purse
his
dagger
are
there
at
last
he
finds
the
book
open
on
his
table
book
is
this
he
asks
himself
has
brought
it
then
he
draws
nearer
sees
the
picture
of
the
horseman
calling
his
falcon
wants
to
read
tries
to
turn
the
leaves
a
cold
perspiration
started
to
the
brow
of
françois
will
he
call
is
the
effect
of
the
poison
sudden
no
no
for
my
mother
said
he
would
die
of
slow
consumption
this
thought
somewhat
reassured
him
ten
minutes
passed
thus
a
century
of
agony
dragging
by
second
after
second
each
supplying
all
that
the
imagination
could
invent
in
the
way
of
maddening
terror
a
world
of
visions
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
rose
and
crossed
the
antechamber
which
was
beginning
to
fill
with
gentlemen
good
morning
gentlemen
said
he
i
am
going
to
the
king
and
to
distract
his
consuming
anxiety
and
perhaps
to
prepare
an
descended
to
his
brother
apartments
why
did
he
go
there
he
did
not
know
what
had
he
to
say
nothing
it
was
not
charles
he
sought
it
was
henry
he
fled
he
took
the
winding
staircase
and
found
the
door
of
the
apartments
half
opened
the
guards
let
the
duke
enter
without
opposition
on
hunting
days
there
was
neither
etiquette
nor
orders
françois
traversed
successively
the
antechamber
the
salon
and
the
bedroom
without
meeting
any
one
he
thought
charles
must
be
in
the
armory
and
opened
the
door
leading
thither
the
king
was
seated
before
a
table
in
a
deep
carved
armchair
he
had
his
back
to
the
door
and
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
what
he
was
doing
the
duke
approached
on
tiptoe
charles
was
reading
by
heaven
cried
he
suddenly
this
is
a
fine
book
i
had
heard
of
it
but
i
did
not
know
it
could
be
had
in
france
listened
and
advanced
a
step
cursed
leaves
said
the
king
wetting
his
thumb
and
applying
it
to
the
pages
it
looks
as
though
they
had
been
stuck
together
on
purpose
to
conceal
the
wonders
they
contain
from
the
eyes
of
man
bounded
forward
the
book
over
which
charles
was
bending
was
the
one
he
had
left
in
henry
room
a
dull
cry
broke
from
him
ah
is
it
you
françois
said
charles
you
are
welcome
come
and
see
the
finest
book
on
hunting
which
ever
came
from
the
pen
of
man
first
impulse
was
to
snatch
the
volume
from
the
hands
of
his
brother
but
an
infernal
thought
restrained
him
a
frightful
smile
passed
over
his
pallid
lips
and
he
rubbed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
like
a
man
dazed
then
recovering
himself
by
degrees
but
without
moving
sire
he
asked
how
did
this
book
come
into
your
possession
i
went
into
henriot
room
this
morning
to
see
if
he
was
ready
he
was
not
there
he
was
probably
strolling
about
the
kennels
or
the
stables
at
any
rate
instead
of
him
i
found
this
treasure
which
i
brought
here
to
read
at
my
leisure
and
the
king
again
moistened
his
thumb
and
again
turned
over
an
obstinate
page
sire
stammered
whose
hair
stood
on
end
and
whose
whole
body
was
seized
with
a
terrible
agony
sire
i
came
to
tell
you
let
me
finish
this
chapter
françois
said
charles
and
then
you
shall
tell
me
anything
you
wish
i
have
read
or
rather
devoured
fifty
pages
he
has
tasted
the
poison
times
murmured
françois
my
brother
is
a
dead
man
then
the
thought
came
to
him
that
there
was
a
god
in
heaven
who
perhaps
after
all
was
not
chance
with
trembling
hand
the
duke
wiped
away
the
cold
perspiration
which
stood
in
drops
on
his
brow
and
waited
in
silence
as
his
brother
had
bade
him
do
until
the
chapter
was
finished
chapter
hawking
charles
still
read
in
his
curiosity
he
seemed
to
devour
the
pages
and
each
page
as
we
have
said
either
because
of
the
dampness
to
which
it
had
been
exposed
for
so
long
or
from
some
other
cause
adhered
to
the
next
with
haggard
eyes
gazed
at
this
terrible
spectacle
the
end
of
which
he
alone
could
see
oh
he
murmured
what
will
happen
i
shall
go
away
into
exile
and
seek
an
imaginary
throne
while
at
the
first
news
of
charles
illness
henry
will
return
to
some
fortified
town
near
the
capital
and
watch
this
prey
sent
us
by
chance
able
at
a
single
stride
to
reach
paris
so
that
before
the
king
of
poland
even
hears
the
news
of
my
brother
death
the
dynasty
will
be
changed
this
can
not
be
such
were
the
thoughts
which
dominated
the
first
involuntary
feeling
of
horror
that
had
urged
françois
to
warn
charles
it
was
the
fatality
which
seemed
to
preserve
henry
and
follow
the
valois
which
the
duke
was
again
going
to
try
to
thwart
in
an
instant
his
whole
plan
with
regard
to
henry
was
altered
it
was
charles
and
not
henry
who
had
read
the
poisoned
book
henry
was
to
have
gone
and
gone
condemned
to
die
the
moment
fate
had
again
saved
him
henry
must
remain
for
henry
was
less
to
be
feared
in
the
bastille
or
as
prisoner
at
vincennes
than
as
the
king
of
navarre
at
the
head
of
thirty
thousand
men
the
duc
let
charles
finish
his
chapter
and
when
the
king
had
raised
his
head
brother
said
the
duke
i
have
waited
because
your
majesty
ordered
me
to
do
so
but
i
regret
it
because
i
have
something
of
the
greatest
importance
to
say
to
you
go
to
the
devil
said
charles
whose
cheeks
were
slowly
turning
a
dull
red
either
because
he
had
been
too
much
engrossed
in
his
reading
or
because
the
poison
had
begun
to
act
go
to
the
devil
if
you
have
come
to
discuss
that
same
subject
again
you
shall
leave
as
did
the
king
of
poland
i
rid
myself
of
him
and
i
will
do
the
same
to
you
without
further
talk
about
it
it
is
not
about
my
leaving
brother
that
i
want
to
speak
to
you
but
about
some
one
else
who
is
going
away
your
majesty
has
touched
me
in
my
most
sensitive
point
my
love
for
you
as
a
brother
my
devotion
to
you
as
a
subject
and
i
hope
to
prove
to
you
that
i
am
no
traitor
well
said
charles
as
he
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
book
crossed
his
legs
and
looked
at
like
a
man
who
is
trying
to
be
patient
some
fresh
report
some
accusation
no
sire
a
certainty
a
plot
which
my
foolish
scruples
alone
prevented
my
revealing
to
you
before
a
plot
said
charles
well
let
us
hear
about
it
sire
said
françois
while
your
majesty
hawks
near
the
river
in
the
plain
of
vesinet
the
king
of
navarre
will
escape
to
the
forest
of
saint
germain
where
a
troop
of
friends
will
be
waiting
to
flee
with
him
ah
i
knew
it
said
charles
another
calumny
against
my
poor
henry
when
will
you
be
through
with
him
your
majesty
need
not
wait
long
at
least
to
find
out
whether
or
not
what
i
have
just
had
the
honor
of
telling
you
is
a
calumny
how
so
because
this
evening
our
will
be
gone
charles
rose
listen
said
he
i
will
try
for
the
last
time
to
believe
you
but
i
warn
you
both
you
and
your
mother
that
it
will
be
the
last
time
then
raising
his
voice
summon
the
king
of
navarre
he
cried
a
guard
started
to
obey
but
françois
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
this
is
a
poor
way
brother
to
learn
anything
said
he
henry
will
deny
will
give
a
signal
his
accomplices
will
be
warned
and
will
disappear
then
my
mother
and
myself
will
be
accused
not
only
of
being
visionary
but
of
being
calumniators
what
do
you
want
then
in
the
name
of
our
brotherly
love
i
ask
your
majesty
to
listen
to
me
in
the
name
of
my
devotion
which
you
will
realize
i
want
you
to
do
nothing
hastily
act
so
that
the
real
culprit
who
for
two
years
has
been
betraying
your
majesty
in
will
as
well
as
in
deed
may
at
last
be
recognized
as
guilty
by
an
infallible
proof
and
punished
as
he
deserves
charles
did
not
answer
but
going
to
a
window
raised
it
the
blood
was
rushing
to
his
head
then
turning
round
quickly
well
said
he
what
would
you
do
speak
françois
sire
said
i
would
surround
the
forest
of
saint
germain
with
three
detachments
of
light
horse
who
at
a
given
hour
eleven
for
instance
should
start
out
and
drive
every
one
in
the
forest
to
the
pavilion
of
francis
which
i
would
as
if
by
chance
have
indicated
as
the
then
i
would
spur
on
as
if
following
my
falcon
to
the
where
henry
should
be
captured
with
his
companions
the
idea
is
good
said
the
king
summon
the
captain
of
the
guards
drew
from
his
doublet
a
silver
whistle
suspended
from
a
gold
chain
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
de
nancey
appeared
charles
gave
him
some
orders
in
a
low
tone
meanwhile
actéon
the
great
greyhound
had
dragged
a
book
from
the
table
and
was
tossing
it
about
the
room
making
great
bounds
after
it
charles
turned
round
and
uttered
a
terrible
oath
the
book
was
the
precious
treatise
on
hunting
of
which
there
existed
only
three
copies
in
the
world
the
punishment
was
proportionate
to
the
offence
charles
seized
a
whip
and
gave
the
dog
three
whistling
blows
actéon
uttered
a
howl
and
fled
under
a
table
covered
with
a
large
cloth
which
served
him
as
a
charles
picked
up
the
book
and
saw
with
joy
that
only
one
leaf
was
gone
and
that
was
not
a
page
of
the
text
but
an
engraving
he
placed
the
volume
carefully
away
on
a
shelf
where
actéon
could
not
reach
it
looked
anxiously
at
him
now
that
the
book
had
fulfilled
its
dread
mission
he
would
have
liked
to
see
it
out
of
charles
hands
six
struck
it
was
time
for
the
king
to
descend
to
the
already
filled
with
horses
richly
caparisoned
and
elegantly
dressed
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
hunters
held
on
their
wrists
their
hooded
falcons
some
outriders
carried
horns
wound
with
scarfs
in
case
the
king
as
sometimes
happened
grew
weary
of
hawking
and
wished
to
hunt
a
deer
or
a
chamois
charles
closed
the
door
of
his
armory
and
descended
watched
each
movement
closely
and
saw
him
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
charles
stopped
and
raised
his
hand
to
his
head
the
limbs
of
the
duc
trembled
no
less
than
did
those
of
the
king
it
seems
to
me
said
the
duke
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
storm
a
storm
in
january
said
charles
you
are
mad
no
i
am
dizzy
my
skin
is
dry
i
am
weak
that
is
all
then
in
a
low
tone
they
will
kill
me
he
murmured
with
their
hatred
and
their
plots
but
on
reaching
the
court
the
fresh
morning
air
the
shouts
of
the
hunters
the
loud
greetings
of
the
hundred
people
gathered
there
produced
their
usual
effect
on
charles
he
breathed
freely
and
happily
his
first
thought
was
for
henry
who
was
beside
marguerite
this
excellent
couple
seemed
to
care
so
much
for
each
other
that
they
were
unable
to
be
apart
on
perceiving
charles
henry
spurred
his
horse
and
in
three
bounds
was
beside
him
ah
ah
said
charles
you
are
mounted
as
if
you
were
going
to
hunt
the
stag
henriot
but
you
know
we
are
going
hawking
then
without
waiting
for
a
reply
forward
gentlemen
forward
we
must
be
hunting
by
nine
and
charles
frowned
and
spoke
in
an
almost
threatening
tone
catharine
was
watching
everything
from
a
window
behind
which
a
curtain
was
drawn
back
showing
her
pale
face
she
herself
was
dressed
in
black
and
was
hidden
from
view
at
the
order
from
charles
all
this
gilded
embroidered
perfumed
crowd
with
the
king
at
its
head
lengthened
out
to
pass
through
the
gate
of
the
louvre
and
swept
like
an
avalanche
along
the
road
to
saint
germain
amid
the
shouts
of
the
people
who
saluted
the
young
king
as
he
rode
by
thoughtful
and
pensive
on
his
white
horse
what
did
he
say
to
you
asked
marguerite
of
henry
he
congratulated
me
on
the
speed
of
my
horse
was
that
all
yes
then
he
suspects
something
i
fear
so
let
us
be
cautious
henry
face
lighted
up
with
one
of
his
beautiful
smiles
which
meant
especially
to
marguerite
be
easy
my
love
as
to
catharine
scarcely
had
the
cortège
left
the
court
of
the
louvre
before
she
dropped
the
curtain
but
she
had
not
failed
to
see
one
thing
namely
henry
pallor
his
nervousness
and
his
conversation
with
marguerite
henry
was
pale
because
not
having
physical
courage
his
blood
under
all
circumstances
in
which
his
life
was
at
stake
instead
of
rushing
to
his
head
as
is
usually
the
case
flowed
to
his
heart
he
was
nervous
because
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
received
by
charles
so
different
from
usual
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
him
finally
he
had
conferred
with
marguerite
because
as
we
know
the
husband
and
wife
had
formed
so
far
as
politics
were
concerned
an
alliance
offensive
and
defensive
but
catharine
had
interpreted
these
facts
differently
this
time
she
murmured
with
her
florentine
smile
i
think
i
may
rely
on
my
dear
henriot
then
to
satisfy
herself
having
waited
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
give
the
party
time
to
leave
paris
she
went
out
of
her
room
mounted
the
winding
staircase
and
with
the
help
of
her
opened
the
door
of
the
apartments
of
the
king
of
navarre
she
searched
but
in
vain
for
the
book
in
vain
she
looked
on
every
table
shelf
and
in
every
closet
nowhere
could
she
find
it
must
have
taken
it
away
said
she
that
was
wise
and
she
descended
to
her
own
chamber
quite
sure
this
time
that
her
plan
would
succeed
the
king
went
on
towards
saint
germain
which
he
reached
after
a
rapid
ride
of
an
hour
and
a
half
they
did
not
ascend
to
the
old
castle
which
rose
dark
and
majestic
in
the
midst
of
the
houses
scattered
over
the
mountain
they
crossed
the
wooden
bridge
which
at
that
time
was
opposite
the
tree
called
the
sully
oak
then
they
signed
for
the
boats
adorned
with
flags
which
followed
the
to
aid
the
king
and
his
suite
in
crossing
the
river
this
was
done
instantly
all
the
joyous
procession
animated
by
such
varied
interests
again
began
to
move
led
by
the
king
over
the
magnificent
plain
which
stretched
from
the
wooded
summit
of
saint
germain
and
which
suddenly
assumed
the
appearance
of
a
great
carpet
covered
with
people
dotted
with
a
thousand
colors
and
of
which
the
river
foaming
along
its
banks
seemed
a
silver
fringe
ahead
of
the
king
still
on
his
white
horse
and
holding
his
favorite
falcon
rode
the
beaters
in
their
long
green
coats
and
high
boots
calling
now
and
then
to
the
half
dozen
great
dogs
and
beating
with
their
whips
the
reeds
which
grew
along
the
river
banks
at
that
moment
the
sun
until
then
hidden
behind
a
cloud
suddenly
burst
forth
and
lighted
with
one
of
its
rays
all
that
procession
of
gold
all
the
ornaments
all
the
glowing
eyes
and
turned
everything
into
a
torrent
of
flame
then
as
if
it
had
waited
for
that
moment
so
that
the
sun
might
shine
on
its
defeat
a
heron
rose
from
the
midst
of
the
reeds
with
a
prolonged
and
plaintiff
cry
haw
haw
cried
charles
unhooding
his
falcon
and
sending
it
after
the
fugitive
haw
haw
cried
every
voice
to
encourage
the
bird
the
falcon
dazzled
for
an
instant
by
the
light
turned
described
a
circle
then
suddenly
perceiving
the
heron
dashed
after
it
but
the
heron
like
a
prudent
bird
had
risen
a
hundred
yards
before
the
beaters
and
while
the
king
had
been
unhooding
his
falcon
and
while
the
latter
had
been
growing
accustomed
to
the
light
it
had
gained
a
considerable
height
so
that
by
the
time
its
enemy
saw
it
it
had
risen
more
than
five
hundred
feet
and
finding
in
the
higher
zones
the
air
necessary
for
its
powerful
wings
continued
to
mount
rapidly
haw
haw
iron
beak
cried
charles
cheering
his
falcon
show
us
that
you
are
a
thoroughbred
haw
haw
as
if
it
understood
the
words
the
noble
bird
rose
like
an
arrow
described
a
diagonal
line
then
a
vertical
one
as
the
heron
had
done
and
mounted
higher
as
though
it
would
soon
disappear
in
the
upper
air
ah
coward
cried
charles
as
if
the
fugitive
could
hear
him
and
spurring
his
horse
he
followed
the
flight
of
the
birds
as
far
as
he
could
his
head
thrown
back
so
as
not
to
lose
sight
of
them
for
an
instant
ah
double
coward
you
run
my
iron
beak
is
a
thoroughbred
on
on
haw
iron
beak
haw
the
contest
was
growing
exciting
the
birds
were
beginning
to
approach
each
other
or
rather
the
falcon
was
nearing
the
heron
the
only
question
was
which
could
rise
the
higher
fear
had
stronger
wings
than
courage
the
falcon
passed
under
the
heron
and
the
latter
profiting
by
its
advantage
dealt
a
blow
with
its
long
beak
the
falcon
as
though
hit
by
a
dagger
described
three
circles
apparently
overcome
and
for
an
instant
it
looked
as
if
the
bird
would
fall
but
like
a
warrior
who
when
wounded
rises
more
terrible
than
before
it
uttered
a
sharp
and
threatening
cry
and
went
after
the
heron
the
latter
making
the
most
of
its
advantage
had
changed
the
direction
of
its
flight
and
turned
toward
the
forest
trying
this
time
to
gain
in
distance
instead
of
in
height
and
so
escape
but
the
falcon
was
indeed
a
thoroughbred
with
the
eye
of
a
gerfalcon
it
repeated
the
same
manoeuvre
rose
diagonally
after
the
heron
which
gave
two
or
three
cries
of
distress
and
strove
to
rise
perpendicularly
as
at
first
at
the
end
of
a
few
seconds
the
two
birds
seemed
again
about
to
disappear
the
heron
looked
no
larger
than
a
lark
and
the
falcon
was
a
black
speck
which
every
moment
grew
smaller
neither
charles
nor
his
suite
any
longer
followed
the
flight
of
the
birds
each
one
stopped
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
clouds
bravo
bravo
cried
charles
suddenly
see
see
gentlemen
he
is
uppermost
haw
haw
faith
i
can
see
neither
of
them
said
henry
nor
i
said
marguerite
well
but
if
you
can
not
see
them
henry
you
can
hear
them
said
charles
at
least
the
heron
listen
listen
he
asks
quarter
two
or
three
plaintive
cries
were
heard
which
a
practised
ear
alone
could
detect
listen
cried
charles
and
you
will
see
them
come
down
more
quickly
than
they
went
up
as
the
king
spoke
the
two
birds
reappeared
they
were
still
only
two
black
dots
but
from
the
size
of
the
dots
the
falcon
seemed
to
be
uppermost
see
see
cried
charles
iron
beak
has
him
the
heron
outwitted
by
the
bird
of
prey
no
longer
strove
to
defend
itself
it
descended
rapidly
constantly
struck
at
by
the
falcon
and
answered
only
by
its
cries
suddenly
it
folded
its
wings
and
dropped
like
a
stone
but
its
adversary
did
the
same
and
when
the
fugitive
again
strove
to
resume
its
flight
a
last
blow
of
the
beak
finished
it
it
continued
to
fall
turning
over
and
over
and
as
it
touched
the
earth
the
falcon
swooped
down
and
uttered
a
cry
of
victory
which
drowned
the
cry
of
defeat
of
the
vanquished
to
the
falcon
the
falcon
shouted
charles
spurring
his
horse
to
the
place
where
the
birds
had
fallen
but
suddenly
he
reined
in
his
steed
uttered
a
cry
dropped
his
bridle
and
grasping
his
horse
mane
with
one
hand
pressed
the
other
to
his
stomach
as
though
he
would
tear
out
his
very
vitals
all
the
courtiers
hastened
to
him
it
is
nothing
nothing
said
charles
with
inflamed
face
and
haggard
eye
it
seemed
as
if
a
iron
were
passing
through
me
just
now
but
forward
it
is
nothing
and
charles
galloped
on
turned
pale
what
now
asked
henry
of
marguerite
i
do
not
know
replied
she
but
did
you
see
my
brother
was
purple
in
the
face
he
is
not
usually
so
said
henry
the
courtiers
glanced
at
one
another
in
surprise
and
followed
the
king
they
arrived
at
the
scene
of
combat
the
falcon
had
already
begun
to
peck
at
the
head
of
the
heron
charles
sprang
from
his
horse
to
obtain
a
nearer
view
but
on
alighting
he
was
obliged
to
seize
hold
of
the
saddle
the
ground
seemed
to
spin
under
him
he
felt
very
sleepy
brother
brother
cried
marguerite
what
is
the
matter
i
feel
said
charles
as
portia
must
have
felt
when
she
swallowed
her
burning
coals
i
am
burning
up
and
my
breath
seems
on
fire
charles
exhaled
his
breath
and
seemed
surprised
not
to
see
fire
issue
from
his
lips
the
falcon
had
been
caught
and
hooded
again
and
every
one
had
gathered
around
the
king
why
what
does
it
mean
great
heavens
it
can
not
be
anything
or
if
it
is
it
must
be
the
sun
which
is
affecting
my
head
and
blinding
my
eyes
so
on
on
to
the
hunt
gentlemen
there
is
a
whole
flight
of
herons
unhood
the
falcons
all
of
them
by
heaven
now
for
some
sport
instantly
five
or
six
falcons
were
unhooded
and
let
loose
they
rose
in
the
direction
of
the
prey
while
the
entire
party
the
king
at
their
head
reached
the
bank
of
the
river
well
what
do
you
say
madame
asked
henry
of
marguerite
that
the
moment
is
favorable
and
that
if
the
king
does
not
look
back
we
can
easily
reach
the
forest
from
here
henry
called
the
attendant
who
was
carrying
the
heron
and
while
the
noisy
gilded
avalanche
swept
along
the
road
which
is
a
terrace
he
remained
behind
as
if
to
examine
the
dead
bird
chapter
li
the
pavilion
of
françois
hawking
was
a
beautiful
sport
as
carried
on
by
kings
when
kings
were
almost
and
when
the
chase
was
not
only
a
pastime
but
an
art
nevertheless
we
must
leave
the
royal
spectacle
to
enter
a
part
of
the
forest
where
the
actors
in
the
scene
we
have
just
described
will
soon
join
us
the
allée
des
violettes
was
a
long
leafy
arcade
and
mossy
retreat
in
which
among
lavender
and
heather
a
startled
hare
now
and
then
pricked
up
its
ears
and
a
wandering
stag
raised
its
head
heavy
with
horns
opened
its
nostrils
and
listened
to
the
right
of
this
alley
was
an
open
space
far
enough
from
the
road
to
be
invisible
but
not
so
far
but
that
the
road
could
be
seen
from
it
in
the
middle
of
the
clearing
two
men
were
lying
on
the
grass
under
them
were
travellers
cloaks
at
their
sides
long
swords
and
near
each
of
them
a
musketoon
then
called
a
petronel
with
the
muzzle
turned
from
them
in
the
richness
of
their
costume
they
resembled
the
joyous
characters
of
the
decameron
on
closer
view
by
the
threatening
aspect
of
their
weapons
they
seemed
like
those
forest
robbers
whom
a
hundred
years
later
salvator
rosa
painted
from
nature
in
his
landscapes
one
of
them
was
leaning
on
his
hand
and
on
one
knee
listening
as
attentively
as
the
hare
or
deer
we
mentioned
above
it
seems
to
me
said
this
one
that
the
hunt
was
very
near
us
just
now
i
heard
the
cries
of
the
hunters
cheering
the
falcon
and
now
said
the
other
who
seemed
to
await
events
with
much
more
philosophy
than
his
companion
now
i
hear
nothing
more
they
must
have
gone
away
i
told
you
this
was
a
poor
place
from
which
to
see
anything
we
can
not
be
seen
it
is
true
but
we
can
not
see
either
the
devil
my
dear
annibal
said
the
first
speaker
we
had
to
put
our
horses
somewhere
as
well
as
the
mules
which
by
the
way
are
so
heavily
laden
that
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
follow
us
now
i
know
that
these
old
beeches
and
oaks
are
perfectly
suited
to
this
difficult
task
i
should
venture
to
say
that
far
from
blaming
monsieur
de
mouy
as
you
are
doing
i
recognize
in
every
detail
of
the
enterprise
he
is
directing
the
common
sense
of
a
true
conspirator
good
said
the
second
gentleman
whom
no
doubt
our
reader
has
already
recognized
as
coconnas
good
that
is
the
word
i
expected
it
i
relied
on
you
for
it
so
we
are
conspiring
we
are
not
conspiring
we
are
serving
the
king
and
the
queen
who
are
conspiring
and
which
amounts
to
the
same
for
us
coconnas
i
have
told
you
said
la
mole
that
i
do
not
in
the
least
force
you
to
follow
me
in
this
affair
i
have
undertaken
it
only
because
of
a
particular
sentiment
which
you
can
neither
feel
nor
share
well
by
heaven
who
said
that
you
were
forcing
me
in
the
first
place
i
know
of
no
one
who
could
compel
coconnas
to
do
what
he
did
not
wish
to
do
but
do
you
suppose
that
i
would
let
you
go
without
following
you
especially
when
i
see
that
you
are
going
to
the
devil
annibal
annibal
said
la
mole
i
think
that
i
see
her
white
palfrey
in
the
distance
oh
it
is
strange
how
my
heart
throbs
at
the
mere
thought
of
her
coming
yes
it
is
strange
said
coconnas
yawning
my
heart
does
not
throb
in
the
least
it
is
not
she
said
la
mole
what
can
have
happened
they
were
to
be
here
at
noon
i
thought
it
happens
that
it
is
not
noon
said
coconnas
that
is
all
and
apparently
we
still
have
time
to
take
a
nap
so
saying
coconnas
stretched
himself
on
his
cloak
like
a
man
who
is
about
to
add
practice
to
precept
but
as
his
ear
touched
the
ground
he
raised
his
finger
and
motioned
la
mole
to
be
silent
what
is
it
asked
the
latter
hush
this
time
i
am
sure
i
hear
something
that
is
singular
i
have
listened
but
i
hear
nothing
nothing
no
well
said
coconnas
rising
and
laying
his
hand
on
la
mole
arm
look
at
that
deer
where
yonder
coconnas
pointed
to
the
animal
well
well
you
will
see
la
mole
watched
the
deer
with
head
bent
forward
as
though
about
to
browse
it
listened
without
stirring
soon
it
turned
its
head
covered
with
magnificent
branching
horns
in
the
direction
from
which
no
doubt
the
sound
came
then
suddenly
without
apparent
cause
it
disappeared
like
a
flash
of
lightning
oh
said
la
mole
i
believe
you
are
right
for
the
deer
has
fled
because
of
that
said
coconnas
it
must
have
heard
what
you
have
not
heard
in
short
a
faint
scarcely
perceptible
sound
quivered
vaguely
through
the
passes
to
less
practised
ears
it
would
have
seemed
like
the
breeze
for
the
two
men
it
was
the
galloping
of
horses
in
an
instant
la
mole
was
on
his
feet
here
they
are
said
he
quick
coconnas
rose
but
more
calmly
the
energy
of
the
piedmontese
seemed
to
have
passed
into
the
heart
of
la
mole
while
on
the
other
hand
the
indolence
of
the
latter
seemed
to
have
taken
possession
of
his
friend
one
acted
with
enthusiasm
the
other
with
reluctance
soon
a
regular
and
measured
sound
struck
the
ear
of
the
two
friends
the
neighing
of
a
horse
made
the
coursers
they
had
tied
ten
paces
away
prick
up
their
ears
as
through
the
alley
there
passed
like
a
white
shadow
a
woman
who
turning
towards
them
made
a
strange
sign
and
disappeared
the
queen
they
exclaimed
together
what
can
it
mean
asked
coconnas
she
made
a
sign
said
la
mole
which
meant
she
made
a
sign
said
coconnas
which
meant
the
signal
meant
for
me
the
signal
meant
yourself
well
said
la
mole
let
each
act
on
his
own
conviction
you
leave
and
i
will
remain
coconnas
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
lay
down
again
at
that
moment
in
the
opposite
direction
from
that
in
which
the
queen
was
going
but
in
the
same
alley
there
passed
at
full
speed
a
troop
of
horsemen
whom
the
two
friends
recognized
as
ardent
almost
rabid
protestants
their
steeds
bounded
like
the
locusts
of
which
job
said
came
and
went
the
deuce
the
affair
is
growing
serious
said
coconnas
rising
let
us
go
to
the
pavilion
of
françois
i
no
said
la
mole
if
we
are
discovered
it
will
be
towards
the
pavilion
that
the
attention
of
the
king
will
be
at
first
directed
since
that
is
the
general
you
may
be
right
this
time
grumbled
coconnas
scarcely
had
coconnas
uttered
these
words
before
a
horseman
passed
among
the
trees
like
a
flash
of
lightning
and
leaping
ditches
bushes
and
all
barriers
reached
the
two
gentlemen
he
held
a
pistol
in
each
hand
and
with
his
knees
alone
guided
his
horse
in
its
furious
chase
monsieur
de
mouy
exclaimed
coconnas
uneasy
and
now
more
on
the
alert
than
la
mole
monsieur
de
mouy
running
away
every
one
for
himself
then
quick
quick
cried
the
huguenot
away
all
is
lost
i
have
come
around
to
tell
you
so
away
as
if
he
had
not
stopped
to
utter
these
words
he
was
gone
almost
before
they
were
spoken
and
before
la
mole
and
coconnas
realized
their
meaning
and
the
queen
cried
la
mole
but
the
young
man
voice
was
lost
in
the
distance
de
mouy
was
too
far
away
either
to
hear
or
to
answer
him
coconnas
had
speedily
made
up
his
mind
while
la
mole
stood
motionless
gazing
after
de
mouy
who
had
disappeared
among
the
trees
he
ran
to
the
horses
led
them
out
sprang
on
his
own
and
throwing
the
bridle
of
the
other
to
la
mole
prepared
to
gallop
off
come
come
cried
he
i
repeat
what
de
mouy
said
let
us
be
off
de
mouy
knows
what
he
is
doing
come
la
mole
quick
one
moment
said
la
mole
we
came
here
for
something
unless
it
is
to
be
hanged
replied
coconnas
i
advise
you
to
lose
no
more
time
i
know
you
are
going
to
parse
some
rhetoric
paraphrase
the
word
speak
of
horace
who
hurled
his
buckler
and
epaminondas
who
was
brought
back
on
his
but
i
tell
you
one
thing
when
monsieur
de
mouy
de
saint
phale
flees
all
the
world
may
run
too
monsieur
de
mouy
de
saint
phale
said
la
mole
was
not
charged
to
carry
off
queen
marguerite
nor
does
monsieur
de
mouy
de
saint
phale
love
queen
marguerite
by
heaven
he
is
right
if
this
love
would
make
him
do
such
foolish
things
as
you
plan
doing
may
five
hundred
thousand
devils
from
hell
take
away
the
love
which
may
cost
two
brave
gentlemen
their
heads
by
heaven
as
king
charles
says
we
are
conspiring
my
dear
fellow
and
when
plans
fail
one
must
run
mount
mount
la
mole
mount
yourself
my
dear
fellow
i
will
not
prevent
you
i
even
urge
you
to
do
so
your
life
is
more
precious
than
mine
defend
it
therefore
you
must
say
to
me
let
us
be
hanged
together
and
not
save
yourself
bah
my
friend
replied
la
mole
the
rope
is
made
for
clowns
not
for
gentlemen
like
ourselves
i
am
beginning
to
think
said
coconnas
that
the
precaution
i
took
is
not
bad
what
precaution
to
have
made
friends
with
the
hangman
you
are
sinister
my
dear
coconnas
well
what
are
we
going
to
do
cried
the
latter
impatiently
set
out
and
find
the
queen
where
i
do
not
know
seek
the
king
where
i
have
not
the
least
idea
but
we
must
find
him
and
we
two
by
ourselves
can
do
what
fifty
others
neither
could
nor
would
dare
to
do
you
appeal
to
my
pride
hyacinthe
that
is
a
bad
sign
well
come
to
horse
and
away
a
good
suggestion
la
mole
turned
to
seize
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
but
just
as
he
put
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
an
imperious
voice
was
heard
halt
there
surrender
at
the
same
moment
the
figure
of
a
man
appeared
behind
an
oak
then
another
then
thirty
they
were
the
who
dismounted
had
glided
on
all
fours
in
and
out
among
the
bushes
searching
the
forest
what
did
i
tell
you
murmured
coconnas
in
a
low
tone
a
dull
groan
was
la
mole
only
answer
the
were
still
thirty
paces
away
from
the
two
friends
well
continued
the
piedmontese
in
a
loud
tone
to
the
lieutenant
of
the
dragoons
what
is
it
gentlemen
the
lieutenant
ordered
his
men
to
aim
coconnas
continued
under
breath
mount
la
mole
there
is
still
time
spring
into
your
saddle
as
i
have
seen
you
do
hundreds
of
times
and
let
us
be
off
then
turning
to
the
the
devil
gentlemen
do
not
fire
you
would
kill
friends
then
to
la
mole
between
the
trees
they
can
not
aim
well
they
will
fire
and
miss
us
impossible
said
la
mole
we
can
not
take
marguerite
horse
with
us
or
the
two
mules
they
would
compromise
us
whereas
by
my
replies
i
can
avert
all
suspicion
go
my
friend
go
gentlemen
said
coconnas
drawing
his
sword
and
raising
it
gentlemen
we
surrender
the
dropped
their
muskets
but
first
tell
us
why
we
must
do
so
you
must
ask
that
of
the
king
of
navarre
what
crime
have
we
committed
monsieur
will
inform
you
coconnas
and
la
mole
looked
at
each
other
the
name
of
their
enemy
at
such
a
moment
did
not
greatly
reassure
them
yet
neither
of
them
made
any
resistance
coconnas
was
asked
to
dismount
a
manoeuvre
which
he
executed
without
a
word
then
both
were
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
and
took
the
road
to
the
pavilion
you
always
wanted
to
see
the
pavilion
of
françois
said
coconnas
to
la
mole
perceiving
through
the
trees
the
walls
of
a
beautiful
gothic
structure
now
it
seems
you
will
la
mole
made
no
reply
but
merely
extended
his
hand
to
coconnas
by
the
side
of
this
lovely
pavilion
built
in
the
time
of
louis
and
named
after
françois
because
the
latter
always
chose
it
as
a
when
he
hunted
was
a
kind
of
hut
built
for
prickers
partly
hidden
behind
the
muskets
halberds
and
shining
swords
like
an
under
a
whitening
harvest
the
prisoners
were
conducted
to
this
hut
we
will
now
relate
what
had
happened
and
so
throw
some
light
on
the
situation
which
looked
very
dark
especially
for
the
two
friends
the
protestant
gentlemen
had
assembled
as
had
been
agreed
on
in
the
pavilion
of
françois
of
which
as
we
know
de
mouy
had
the
key
masters
of
the
forest
or
at
least
so
they
had
believed
they
had
placed
sentinels
here
and
there
whom
the
having
exchanged
their
white
scarfs
for
red
ones
a
precaution
due
to
the
ingenious
zeal
of
monsieur
de
nancey
had
surprised
and
carried
away
without
a
blow
the
had
continued
their
search
surrounding
the
pavilion
but
de
mouy
who
as
we
know
was
waiting
for
the
king
at
the
end
of
the
allée
des
violettes
had
perceived
the
red
scarfs
stealing
along
and
had
instantly
suspected
them
he
sprang
to
one
side
so
as
not
to
be
seen
and
noticed
that
the
vast
circle
was
narrowing
in
such
a
way
as
to
beat
the
forest
and
surround
the
at
the
same
time
at
the
end
of
the
principal
alley
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
white
aigrettes
and
the
shining
arquebuses
of
the
king
bodyguard
finally
he
saw
the
king
himself
while
in
the
opposite
direction
he
perceived
the
king
of
navarre
then
with
his
hat
he
had
made
a
sign
of
the
cross
which
was
the
signal
agreed
on
to
indicate
that
all
was
lost
at
this
signal
the
king
had
turned
back
and
disappeared
de
mouy
at
once
dug
the
two
wide
rowels
of
his
spurs
into
the
sides
of
his
horse
and
galloped
away
shouting
as
he
went
the
words
of
warning
which
we
have
mentioned
to
la
mole
and
coconnas
now
the
king
who
had
noticed
the
absence
of
henry
and
marguerite
arrived
escorted
by
monsieur
just
as
the
two
men
came
out
of
the
hut
to
which
he
had
said
that
all
those
found
not
only
in
the
pavilion
but
in
the
forest
were
to
be
conducted
full
of
confidence
galloped
close
by
the
king
whose
sharp
pains
were
augmenting
his
ill
humor
two
or
three
times
he
had
nearly
fainted
and
once
he
had
vomited
blood
come
said
he
on
arriving
let
us
make
haste
i
want
to
return
to
the
louvre
bring
out
all
these
rascals
from
their
hole
this
is
saint
blaise
day
he
was
cousin
to
saint
bartholomew
at
these
words
of
the
king
the
entire
mass
of
pikes
and
muskets
began
to
move
and
one
by
one
the
huguenots
were
forced
out
not
only
from
the
forest
and
the
pavilion
but
from
the
hut
but
the
king
of
navarre
marguerite
and
de
mouy
were
not
there
well
said
the
king
where
is
henry
where
is
margot
you
promised
them
to
me
and
by
heaven
they
will
have
to
be
found
sire
we
have
not
even
seen
the
king
and
the
queen
of
navarre
but
here
they
are
said
madame
de
nevers
at
that
moment
at
the
end
of
an
alley
leading
to
the
river
henry
and
margot
came
in
sight
both
as
calm
as
if
nothing
had
happened
both
with
their
falcons
on
their
wrists
riding
lovingly
side
by
side
so
that
as
they
galloped
along
their
horses
like
themselves
seemed
to
be
caressing
each
other
it
was
then
that
furious
commanded
the
forest
to
be
searched
and
that
la
mole
and
coconnas
were
found
within
their
ivy
bower
they
too
in
brotherly
proximity
entered
the
circle
formed
by
the
guards
only
as
they
were
not
sovereigns
they
could
not
assume
so
calm
a
manner
as
henry
and
marguerite
la
mole
was
too
pale
and
coconnas
too
red
chapter
lii
the
examination
the
spectacle
which
struck
the
young
men
as
they
entered
the
circle
although
seen
but
for
a
few
moments
was
one
never
to
be
forgotten
as
we
have
said
charles
ix
had
watched
the
gentlemen
as
the
guards
led
them
one
by
one
from
the
pricker
hut
both
he
and
anxiously
followed
every
movement
waiting
to
see
the
king
of
navarre
come
out
both
however
were
doomed
to
disappointment
but
it
was
not
enough
to
know
that
the
king
was
not
there
it
was
necessary
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
him
therefore
when
the
young
couple
were
seen
approaching
from
the
end
of
the
alley
turned
pale
while
charles
felt
his
heart
grow
glad
he
instinctively
desired
that
everything
his
brother
had
forced
him
to
do
should
fall
back
on
the
duke
he
will
outwit
us
again
murmured
françois
growing
still
paler
at
that
moment
the
king
was
seized
with
such
violent
pains
that
he
dropped
his
bridle
pressed
both
hands
to
his
sides
and
shrieked
like
a
madman
henry
hastily
approached
him
but
by
the
time
he
had
traversed
the
few
hundred
feet
which
separated
them
charles
had
recovered
whence
do
you
come
monsieur
said
the
king
with
a
sternness
that
frightened
marguerite
why
from
the
hunt
brother
replied
she
the
hunt
was
along
the
river
bank
and
not
in
the
forest
my
falcon
swooped
down
on
a
pheasant
just
as
we
stopped
behind
every
one
to
look
at
the
heron
where
is
the
pheasant
here
a
beautiful
bird
is
it
not
and
henry
in
perfect
innocence
held
up
his
bird
of
purple
blue
and
gold
plumage
ah
said
charles
and
this
pheasant
caught
why
did
you
not
rejoin
me
because
the
bird
had
directed
its
flight
towards
the
park
sire
and
when
we
returned
to
the
river
bank
we
saw
you
half
a
mile
ahead
of
us
riding
towards
the
forest
we
set
out
to
gallop
after
you
therefore
for
being
in
your
majesty
we
did
not
wish
to
lose
you
and
were
all
these
gentlemen
invited
also
said
charles
what
gentlemen
asked
henry
casting
an
inquiring
look
about
why
your
huguenots
by
heaven
said
charles
at
all
events
if
they
were
invited
it
was
not
by
me
no
sire
replied
henry
but
possibly
monsieur
asked
them
monsieur
how
so
i
said
the
duke
why
yes
brother
said
henry
did
you
not
announce
yesterday
that
you
were
king
of
navarre
the
huguenots
who
demanded
you
for
their
king
have
come
to
thank
you
for
having
accepted
the
crown
and
the
king
for
having
given
it
is
it
not
so
gentlemen
yes
yes
cried
twenty
voices
long
live
the
duc
long
live
king
charles
i
am
not
king
of
the
huguenots
said
françois
white
with
anger
then
glancing
stealthily
at
charles
and
i
sincerely
trust
i
never
shall
be
no
matter
said
charles
but
you
must
know
henry
that
i
consider
all
this
very
strange
sire
said
the
king
of
navarre
firmly
god
forgive
me
but
one
would
say
that
i
were
undergoing
an
examination
and
if
i
should
tell
you
that
you
were
what
would
you
answer
that
i
am
a
king
like
yourself
sire
replied
henry
proudly
for
it
is
not
the
crown
but
birth
that
makes
royalty
and
that
i
would
gladly
answer
any
questions
from
my
brother
and
my
friend
but
never
from
my
judge
and
yet
murmured
charles
i
should
really
like
to
know
for
once
in
my
life
how
to
act
let
monsieur
de
mouy
be
brought
out
said
and
then
you
will
know
monsieur
de
mouy
must
be
among
the
prisoners
is
monsieur
de
mouy
here
asked
the
king
henry
felt
a
moment
anxiety
and
exchanged
glances
with
marguerite
but
his
uneasiness
was
of
short
duration
no
voice
replied
monsieur
de
mouy
is
not
among
the
prisoners
said
monsieur
de
nancey
some
of
our
men
think
they
saw
him
but
no
one
is
sure
of
it
uttered
an
oath
well
said
marguerite
pointing
to
la
mole
and
coconnas
who
had
heard
all
that
had
passed
and
on
whose
intelligence
she
felt
she
could
depend
there
are
two
gentlemen
in
the
service
of
monsieur
question
them
they
will
answer
the
duke
felt
the
blow
i
had
them
arrested
on
purpose
to
prove
that
they
do
not
belong
to
me
said
he
the
king
looked
at
the
two
friends
and
started
on
seeing
la
mole
again
ah
that
provençal
here
said
he
coconnas
bowed
graciously
what
were
you
doing
when
you
were
arrested
asked
the
king
sire
we
were
planning
deeds
of
war
and
of
love
on
horseback
armed
to
the
teeth
ready
for
flight
no
sire
said
coconnas
your
majesty
is
misinformed
we
were
lying
under
the
shade
of
a
beech
tree
tegmine
ah
so
you
were
lying
under
the
shade
of
a
beech
tree
and
we
might
easily
have
escaped
had
we
thought
that
in
any
way
we
had
roused
your
majesty
anger
now
gentlemen
on
your
honor
as
soldiers
continued
coconnas
turning
to
the
do
you
not
think
that
had
we
so
wished
we
could
have
escaped
the
fact
is
said
the
lieutenant
that
these
gentlemen
did
not
even
attempt
to
run
because
their
horses
were
too
far
away
said
the
duc
i
humbly
beg
monseigneur
pardon
said
coconnas
but
i
was
on
mine
and
my
friend
the
comte
lerac
de
la
mole
was
holding
his
by
the
bridle
is
this
true
gentlemen
said
the
king
yes
sire
replied
the
lieutenant
on
seeing
us
monsieur
de
coconnas
even
dismounted
coconnas
smiled
in
a
way
which
signified
you
see
sire
but
the
other
horses
the
mules
and
the
boxes
with
which
they
were
laden
asked
françois
well
said
coconnas
are
we
stable
boys
send
for
the
groom
who
had
charge
of
them
he
is
not
here
exclaimed
the
duke
furious
then
he
must
have
become
frightened
and
run
away
said
coconnas
one
can
not
expect
a
clown
to
have
the
manners
of
a
gentleman
always
the
same
system
said
gnashing
his
teeth
fortunately
sire
i
told
you
that
for
some
time
these
gentlemen
have
not
been
in
my
service
i
exclaimed
coconnas
am
i
unfortunate
enough
no
longer
to
belong
to
your
highness
by
heaven
monsieur
you
ought
to
know
that
better
than
any
one
since
you
yourself
gave
me
your
dismissal
in
a
letter
so
impertinent
that
thank
god
i
kept
it
and
fortunately
have
it
with
me
oh
exclaimed
coconnas
i
had
hoped
that
your
highness
would
forgive
me
for
a
letter
written
under
the
first
impulse
of
anger
i
had
been
told
that
your
highness
had
tried
to
strangle
my
friend
la
mole
in
one
of
the
corridors
of
the
louvre
what
is
he
saying
interrupted
the
king
at
first
i
thought
your
highness
was
alone
continued
coconnas
ingenuously
but
afterwards
i
learned
that
three
others
silence
exclaimed
charles
we
have
heard
enough
henry
said
he
to
the
king
of
navarre
your
word
not
to
try
to
escape
i
give
it
to
your
majesty
sire
return
to
paris
with
monsieur
de
nancey
and
remain
in
your
chamber
under
arrest
you
gentlemen
continued
he
addressing
the
two
friends
give
up
your
swords
la
mole
looked
at
marguerite
she
smiled
la
mole
at
once
handed
his
sword
to
the
nearest
officer
coconnas
did
the
same
has
monsieur
de
mouy
been
found
asked
the
king
no
sire
said
monsieur
de
nancey
either
he
was
not
in
the
forest
or
he
escaped
so
much
the
worse
said
the
king
but
let
us
return
i
am
cold
and
dizzy
sire
it
is
from
anger
probably
said
françois
possibly
but
my
eyes
trouble
me
where
are
the
prisoners
i
can
not
see
them
is
it
night
already
oh
mercy
i
am
burning
up
help
help
the
unfortunate
king
dropped
the
bridle
of
his
horse
stretched
out
his
arms
and
fell
backward
the
courtiers
frightened
at
this
second
attack
caught
him
as
he
fell
françois
standing
apart
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
for
he
alone
knew
the
cause
of
the
trouble
from
which
his
brother
was
suffering
on
the
other
side
the
king
of
navarre
already
under
the
guard
of
monsieur
de
nancey
looked
upon
the
scene
with
growing
astonishment
well
well
murmured
he
with
that
wonderful
intuition
which
at
times
made
him
seem
inspired
was
i
perhaps
fortunate
in
having
been
stopped
in
my
flight
he
glanced
at
margot
whose
great
eyes
wide
open
with
surprise
were
looking
first
at
him
and
then
at
the
king
this
time
charles
was
unconscious
a
litter
was
brought
and
he
was
laid
on
it
they
covered
him
with
a
cloak
taken
from
the
shoulders
of
one
of
the
courtiers
the
procession
silently
set
out
in
the
direction
of
paris
whence
that
morning
conspirators
and
a
happy
king
had
started
forth
and
to
which
now
a
dying
king
was
returning
surrounded
by
rebel
prisoners
marguerite
who
throughout
all
this
had
lost
neither
the
control
of
her
mind
nor
body
gave
her
husband
a
look
of
intelligence
then
passing
so
close
to
la
mole
that
the
latter
was
able
to
catch
the
following
two
greek
words
she
said
which
meant
fear
nothing
what
did
she
say
asked
coconnas
she
told
me
to
fear
nothing
replied
la
mole
so
much
the
worse
murmured
the
piedmontese
so
much
the
worse
that
means
that
it
is
not
good
for
us
to
be
here
every
time
that
word
has
been
said
to
me
in
an
encouraging
tone
i
have
either
received
a
bullet
or
a
in
my
body
or
a
flower
pot
on
my
head
nothing
whether
in
hebrew
greek
latin
or
french
has
always
meant
for
me
care
forward
gentlemen
said
the
lieutenant
of
the
without
being
indiscreet
monsieur
said
coconnas
may
we
know
where
we
are
going
to
vincennes
i
think
said
the
lieutenant
i
would
rather
go
elsewhere
said
coconnas
but
one
does
not
always
go
just
where
one
wishes
on
the
way
the
king
recovered
consciousness
and
some
strength
at
nanterre
he
even
wanted
to
ride
but
this
was
not
allowed
summon
maître
ambroise
paré
said
charles
on
reaching
the
louvre
he
descended
from
his
litter
ascended
the
stairs
leaning
on
the
arm
of
tavannes
and
entered
his
apartment
giving
orders
that
no
one
be
allowed
to
follow
him
every
one
had
noticed
that
he
seemed
very
grave
during
the
journey
he
had
been
in
a
deep
study
not
addressing
a
word
to
any
one
concerned
neither
with
conspiracy
nor
conspirators
it
was
evident
that
he
was
occupied
with
his
illness
a
malady
so
sudden
so
strange
so
severe
some
of
the
symptoms
of
which
had
been
noticed
in
his
brother
françois
ii
a
short
time
before
his
death
so
the
order
to
admit
no
one
whomsoever
to
his
rooms
except
maître
paré
caused
no
surprise
it
was
well
known
that
the
prince
was
a
misanthrope
charles
entered
his
seated
himself
in
a
and
leaned
his
head
against
the
cushions
then
reflecting
that
maître
ambroise
paré
might
not
be
at
home
and
that
there
might
be
some
delay
before
he
saw
him
he
decided
to
employ
the
intervening
time
he
clapped
his
hands
thus
summoning
a
guard
say
to
the
king
of
navarre
that
i
wish
to
speak
with
him
said
charles
the
man
bowed
and
withdrew
just
then
charles
head
fell
back
a
great
weight
seemed
to
oppress
him
his
ideas
grew
confused
it
was
as
if
a
sort
of
bloody
vapor
were
floating
before
his
eyes
his
mouth
was
dry
although
he
had
already
swallowed
a
whole
carafe
of
water
while
he
was
in
this
drowsy
state
the
door
opened
and
henry
appeared
monsieur
de
nancey
had
followed
him
but
stopped
in
the
antechamber
the
king
of
navarre
waited
until
the
door
was
closed
then
he
advanced
sire
said
he
you
sent
for
me
i
am
here
the
king
started
at
the
voice
and
mechanically
extended
his
hand
sire
said
henry
letting
his
arms
hang
at
his
side
your
majesty
forgets
that
i
am
no
longer
your
brother
but
your
prisoner
ah
that
is
true
said
charles
thank
you
for
having
reminded
me
of
it
moreover
it
seems
to
me
that
when
we
last
spoke
together
you
promised
to
answer
frankly
what
i
might
ask
you
i
am
ready
to
keep
my
word
sire
ask
your
questions
the
king
poured
some
cold
water
into
his
hand
and
applied
it
to
his
forehead
tell
me
henry
how
much
truth
is
there
in
the
accusation
brought
against
you
by
the
duc
only
a
little
it
was
monsieur
who
was
to
have
fled
and
i
who
was
to
have
accompanied
him
and
why
should
you
have
gone
with
him
are
you
dissatisfied
with
me
henry
no
sire
on
the
contrary
i
have
only
praise
for
your
majesty
and
god
who
reads
our
hearts
knows
how
deeply
i
love
my
brother
and
my
king
it
seems
to
me
said
charles
that
it
is
not
natural
to
flee
from
those
we
love
and
who
love
us
i
was
not
fleeing
from
those
who
love
me
i
was
fleeing
from
those
who
hate
me
will
your
majesty
permit
me
to
speak
openly
speak
monsieur
those
who
hate
me
sire
are
monsieur
and
the
queen
mother
as
for
monsieur
i
will
not
answer
but
the
queen
mother
overwhelms
you
with
attentions
that
is
just
why
i
mistrust
her
sire
and
i
do
well
to
do
so
mistrust
her
her
or
those
about
her
you
know
sire
that
the
misfortune
of
kings
is
not
always
that
they
are
too
little
but
that
they
are
too
well
served
explain
yourself
you
promised
to
tell
me
everything
your
majesty
will
see
that
i
will
do
so
continue
your
majesty
loves
me
you
have
said
i
loved
you
before
your
treason
henry
pretend
that
you
still
love
me
sire
very
well
if
you
love
me
you
must
want
me
to
live
do
you
not
i
should
be
wretched
were
any
harm
to
befall
you
well
sire
twice
your
majesty
has
just
escaped
being
wretched
how
so
twice
providence
has
saved
my
life
it
is
true
that
the
second
time
providence
assumed
the
features
of
your
majesty
what
form
did
it
assume
the
first
time
that
of
a
man
who
would
be
greatly
surprised
to
see
himself
mistaken
for
providence
i
mean
réné
you
sire
saved
me
from
steel
charles
frowned
for
he
remembered
the
night
when
he
had
taken
henry
to
the
rue
des
barres
and
réné
said
he
réné
saved
me
from
poison
the
deuce
henriot
you
have
luck
said
the
king
trying
to
smile
but
a
quick
spasm
of
pain
changed
the
effort
into
a
nervous
contraction
of
the
lips
that
is
not
his
profession
two
miracles
saved
me
sire
a
miracle
of
repentance
on
the
part
of
the
florentine
and
a
miracle
of
goodness
on
your
part
well
i
will
confess
to
your
majesty
that
i
am
afraid
heaven
will
grow
weary
of
working
miracles
and
i
tried
to
run
away
because
of
the
proverb
helps
those
who
help
themselves
why
did
you
not
tell
me
this
sooner
henriot
had
i
uttered
these
words
yesterday
i
should
have
been
a
denunciator
and
is
different
i
am
accused
and
i
am
defending
myself
are
you
sure
of
the
first
attempt
henriot
as
sure
as
i
am
of
the
second
and
they
tried
to
poison
you
yes
with
what
with
an
opiate
how
could
they
poison
you
with
an
opiate
why
sire
ask
réné
poisoning
is
done
with
gloves
charles
frowned
then
by
degrees
his
brow
cleared
yes
said
he
as
if
speaking
to
himself
it
is
the
nature
of
wild
creatures
to
flee
from
death
why
then
should
not
knowledge
do
what
instinct
does
well
sire
said
henry
is
your
majesty
satisfied
with
my
frankness
and
do
you
believe
that
i
have
told
you
everything
yes
henriot
and
you
are
a
good
fellow
do
you
think
that
those
who
hate
you
have
grown
weary
or
will
new
attempts
be
made
on
your
life
sire
every
evening
i
am
surprised
to
find
myself
still
living
it
is
because
they
know
i
love
you
henriot
that
they
wish
to
kill
you
but
do
not
worry
they
shall
be
punished
for
their
evil
intentions
meanwhile
you
are
free
free
to
leave
paris
sire
asked
henry
no
you
well
know
that
i
can
not
possibly
do
without
you
in
the
name
of
a
thousand
devils
i
must
have
some
one
here
who
loves
me
then
sire
if
your
majesty
keep
me
with
you
will
you
grant
me
a
favor
what
is
it
not
to
keep
me
as
a
friend
but
as
a
prisoner
yes
does
not
your
majesty
see
that
it
is
your
friendship
for
me
that
is
my
ruin
would
you
prefer
my
hatred
your
apparent
hatred
sire
it
will
save
me
as
soon
as
they
think
i
am
in
disgrace
they
will
be
less
anxious
for
my
death
henriot
said
charles
i
know
neither
what
you
desire
nor
what
object
you
seek
but
if
your
wishes
do
not
succeed
and
if
your
object
is
not
accomplished
i
shall
be
greatly
surprised
i
may
then
count
on
the
severity
of
the
king
yes
in
that
case
i
shall
be
less
uneasy
now
what
are
your
commands
return
to
your
apartments
henriot
i
am
in
pain
i
will
see
my
dogs
and
then
go
to
bed
sire
said
henry
your
majesty
ought
to
send
for
a
physician
your
trouble
is
perhaps
more
serious
than
you
imagine
i
have
sent
for
maître
ambroise
paré
henriot
then
i
shall
retire
more
satisfied
upon
my
soul
said
the
king
i
believe
that
of
all
my
family
you
are
the
only
one
who
really
loves
me
is
this
indeed
your
opinion
sire
on
the
word
of
a
gentleman
then
commend
me
to
monsieur
de
nancey
as
a
man
your
deep
anger
may
not
allow
to
live
a
month
by
this
means
you
will
have
me
many
years
to
love
you
monsieur
de
nancey
cried
charles
the
captain
of
the
guards
entered
i
commit
into
your
hands
the
most
guilty
man
of
my
kingdom
you
will
answer
for
him
with
your
life
henry
assumed
an
air
of
consternation
and
followed
monsieur
de
nancey
chapter
liii
actéon
charles
left
alone
wondered
greatly
at
not
having
seen
either
of
his
favorites
his
nurse
madeleine
or
his
greyhound
actéon
nurse
must
have
gone
to
chant
psalms
with
some
huguenot
of
her
acquaintance
said
he
to
himself
and
actéon
is
probably
still
angry
with
me
for
the
whipping
i
gave
him
this
morning
charles
took
a
candle
and
went
into
his
nurse
room
the
good
woman
was
not
there
from
her
chamber
a
door
opened
into
the
armory
it
may
be
remembered
the
king
started
towards
this
door
but
as
he
did
so
he
was
seized
with
one
of
those
spasms
he
had
already
felt
and
which
seemed
to
attack
him
suddenly
he
felt
as
if
his
entrails
were
being
run
through
with
a
iron
and
an
unquenchable
thirst
consumed
him
seeing
a
cup
of
milk
on
the
table
he
swallowed
it
at
a
gulp
and
felt
somewhat
relieved
taking
the
candle
he
had
set
down
he
entered
the
armory
to
his
great
astonishment
actéon
did
not
come
to
meet
him
had
he
been
shut
up
if
so
he
would
have
known
that
his
master
had
returned
from
hunting
and
would
have
barked
charles
called
and
whistled
but
no
animal
appeared
he
advanced
a
few
steps
and
as
the
light
from
the
candle
fell
upon
a
corner
of
the
room
he
perceived
an
inert
something
lying
there
on
the
floor
why
hello
actéon
cried
charles
he
whistled
again
but
the
dog
did
not
stir
charles
hastened
forward
and
touched
him
the
poor
beast
was
stiff
and
cold
from
his
throat
contracted
by
pain
several
drops
of
gall
had
fallen
mixed
with
foamy
and
bloody
saliva
the
dog
had
found
an
old
cap
of
his
master
in
the
armory
and
had
died
with
his
head
resting
on
this
object
which
represented
a
friend
at
the
sight
which
made
him
forget
his
own
pain
and
restored
all
his
energy
rage
boiled
in
charles
veins
he
would
have
cried
out
but
restrained
as
they
are
in
their
greatness
kings
are
not
free
to
yield
to
that
first
impulse
which
every
man
turns
to
the
profit
of
his
passion
or
to
his
defence
charles
reflected
that
there
had
been
some
treason
and
was
silent
then
he
knelt
down
before
his
dog
and
with
experienced
eye
examined
the
body
the
eyes
were
glassy
the
tongue
red
and
covered
with
pustules
it
was
a
strange
disease
and
one
which
made
charles
shudder
the
king
put
on
his
gloves
which
he
had
taken
off
and
slipped
into
his
belt
opened
the
livid
lips
of
the
dog
to
examine
his
teeth
and
perceived
in
the
interstices
some
fragments
clinging
to
the
sharp
points
of
the
molars
he
took
out
these
pieces
and
saw
that
they
were
paper
near
where
the
paper
had
been
the
swelling
was
greater
the
gums
were
swollen
and
the
skin
looked
as
if
it
had
been
eaten
by
vitriol
charles
gazed
carefully
around
him
on
the
carpet
lay
two
or
three
bits
of
the
paper
similar
to
that
which
he
had
already
recognized
in
the
dog
mouth
one
of
the
pieces
larger
than
the
others
showed
the
marks
of
a
woodcut
charles
hair
stood
on
end
for
he
recognized
a
fragment
of
the
picture
which
represented
a
gentleman
hawking
and
which
actéon
had
torn
from
the
treatise
on
hunting
ah
said
he
turning
pale
the
book
was
poisoned
then
suddenly
remembering
a
thousand
devils
he
exclaimed
i
touched
every
page
with
my
finger
and
at
every
page
i
raised
my
finger
to
my
lips
these
these
attacks
of
pain
and
vomiting
i
am
a
dead
man
for
an
instant
charles
remained
motionless
under
the
weight
of
this
terrible
thought
then
rising
with
a
dull
groan
he
hastened
to
the
door
of
the
armory
maître
réné
he
cried
i
want
maître
réné
the
florentine
send
some
one
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
pont
saint
michel
and
bring
him
to
me
he
must
be
here
within
ten
minutes
let
some
one
mount
a
horse
and
lead
another
that
he
may
come
more
quickly
if
maître
ambroise
paré
arrives
have
him
wait
a
guard
went
instantly
to
carry
out
the
king
commands
oh
murmured
charles
if
i
have
to
put
everybody
to
the
torture
i
will
know
who
gave
this
book
to
henriot
and
with
perspiration
on
his
brow
clenched
hands
and
heaving
breast
he
stood
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
body
of
his
dead
dog
ten
minutes
later
the
florentine
knocked
timidly
and
not
without
some
anxiety
at
the
door
of
the
king
apartments
there
are
some
consciences
to
which
the
sky
is
never
clear
enter
said
charles
the
perfumer
appeared
charles
went
towards
him
with
imperious
air
and
compressed
lip
your
majesty
sent
for
me
said
réné
trembling
you
are
a
skilful
chemist
are
you
not
sire
and
you
know
all
that
the
cleverest
doctors
know
your
majesty
exaggerates
no
my
mother
has
told
me
so
besides
i
have
confidence
in
you
and
i
prefer
to
consult
you
rather
than
any
one
else
see
he
continued
pointing
to
the
dog
look
at
what
this
animal
has
between
his
teeth
i
beg
you
and
tell
me
of
what
he
died
while
réné
candle
in
hand
bent
over
the
floor
as
much
to
hide
his
emotion
as
to
obey
the
king
charles
stood
up
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
man
waiting
with
an
impatience
easy
to
understand
for
the
reply
which
was
to
be
his
sentence
of
death
or
his
assurance
of
safety
réné
drew
a
kind
of
scalpel
from
his
pocket
opened
it
and
with
the
point
detached
from
the
mouth
of
the
greyhound
the
particles
of
paper
which
adhered
to
the
gums
then
he
looked
long
and
attentively
at
the
humor
and
the
blood
which
oozed
from
each
wound
sire
said
he
trembling
the
symptoms
are
very
bad
charles
felt
an
icy
shudder
run
through
his
veins
to
his
very
heart
yes
said
he
the
dog
has
been
poisoned
has
he
not
i
fear
so
sire
with
what
sort
of
poison
with
mineral
poison
i
think
can
you
ascertain
positively
that
he
has
been
poisoned
yes
certainly
by
opening
and
examining
the
stomach
open
it
i
wish
there
to
be
no
doubt
i
must
call
some
one
to
assist
me
i
will
help
you
said
charles
you
sire
yes
if
he
has
been
poisoned
what
symptoms
shall
we
find
red
blotches
and
herborizations
in
the
stomach
come
then
said
charles
begin
with
a
stroke
of
the
scalpel
réné
opened
the
hound
body
and
with
his
two
hands
removed
the
stomach
while
charles
one
knee
on
the
floor
held
the
light
with
clenched
and
trembling
hand
see
sire
said
réné
here
are
evident
marks
these
are
the
red
spots
i
spoke
of
as
to
these
bloody
veins
which
seem
like
the
roots
of
a
plant
they
are
what
i
meant
by
herborizations
i
find
here
everything
i
looked
for
so
the
dog
was
poisoned
yes
sire
with
mineral
poison
in
all
probability
and
what
symptoms
would
a
man
have
who
had
inadvertently
swallowed
some
of
the
same
poison
great
pain
in
the
head
internal
burning
as
if
he
had
swallowed
hot
coals
pains
in
the
bowels
and
vomiting
would
he
be
thirsty
asked
charles
intensely
thirsty
that
is
it
that
is
it
murmured
the
king
sire
i
seek
in
vain
for
the
motive
for
all
these
questions
of
what
use
to
seek
it
you
need
not
know
it
answer
my
questions
that
is
all
yes
sire
what
is
the
antidote
to
give
a
man
who
may
have
swallowed
the
same
substance
as
my
dog
réné
reflected
an
instant
there
are
several
mineral
poisons
said
he
and
before
answering
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
mean
has
your
majesty
any
idea
of
the
way
in
which
your
dog
was
poisoned
yes
said
charles
he
chewed
the
leaf
of
a
book
the
leaf
of
a
book
yes
has
your
majesty
this
book
here
it
is
said
charles
and
taking
the
volume
from
the
shelf
where
he
had
placed
it
he
handed
it
to
réné
the
latter
gave
a
start
of
surprise
which
did
not
escape
the
king
he
ate
a
leaf
of
this
book
stammered
réné
yes
this
one
and
charles
pointed
to
the
torn
page
will
you
allow
me
to
tear
out
another
sire
do
so
réné
tore
out
a
leaf
and
held
it
over
the
candle
the
paper
caught
fire
filling
the
room
with
a
strong
smell
of
garlic
he
has
been
poisoned
with
a
preparation
of
arsenic
said
he
you
are
sure
as
sure
as
if
i
had
prepared
it
myself
and
the
antidote
réné
shook
his
head
what
said
charles
in
a
hoarse
voice
you
know
no
remedy
the
best
and
most
efficacious
is
the
white
of
eggs
beaten
in
milk
but
but
what
it
must
be
administered
at
once
otherwise
otherwise
sire
it
is
a
terrible
poison
said
réné
again
yet
it
does
not
kill
immediately
said
charles
no
but
it
kills
surely
no
matter
how
long
the
time
though
even
this
may
sometimes
be
calculated
charles
leaned
against
the
marble
table
now
said
he
putting
his
hand
on
réné
shoulder
you
know
this
book
i
sire
said
réné
turning
pale
yes
you
on
seeing
it
you
betrayed
yourself
sire
i
swear
to
you
réné
said
charles
listen
to
me
you
poisoned
the
queen
of
navarre
with
gloves
you
poisoned
the
prince
of
porcion
with
the
smoke
from
a
lamp
you
tried
to
poison
monsieur
de
condé
with
a
scented
apple
réné
i
will
have
your
skin
removed
with
pincers
bit
by
bit
if
you
do
not
tell
me
to
whom
this
book
belongs
the
florentine
saw
that
he
could
not
dally
with
the
anger
of
charles
and
resolved
to
be
bold
if
i
tell
the
truth
sire
who
will
guarantee
that
i
shall
not
be
more
cruelly
punished
than
if
i
keep
silent
i
will
will
you
give
me
your
royal
word
on
my
honor
as
a
gentleman
your
life
shall
be
spared
said
the
king
the
book
belongs
to
me
then
said
réné
to
you
cried
charles
starting
back
and
looking
at
the
poisoner
with
haggard
eyes
yes
to
me
how
did
it
leave
your
possession
her
majesty
the
queen
mother
took
it
from
my
house
the
queen
mother
exclaimed
charles
yes
with
what
object
with
the
intention
i
think
of
having
it
sent
to
the
king
of
navarre
who
had
asked
the
duc
for
a
book
of
the
kind
in
order
to
study
the
art
of
hawking
ah
cried
charles
that
is
it
i
see
it
all
the
book
indeed
was
in
henriot
room
there
is
a
destiny
about
this
and
i
submit
to
it
at
that
moment
charles
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
followed
by
fresh
pain
in
the
bowels
he
gave
two
or
three
stifled
cries
and
fell
back
in
his
chair
what
is
the
matter
sire
asked
réné
in
a
frightened
voice
nothing
said
charles
except
that
i
am
thirsty
give
me
something
to
drink
réné
filled
a
glass
with
water
and
with
trembling
hand
gave
it
to
charles
who
swallowed
it
at
a
draught
now
said
he
taking
a
pen
and
dipping
it
into
the
ink
write
in
this
book
what
must
i
write
what
i
am
going
to
dictate
to
you
book
on
hawking
was
given
by
me
to
the
queen
mother
catharine
de
réné
took
the
pen
and
wrote
now
sign
your
name
the
florentine
obeyed
you
promised
to
save
my
life
i
will
keep
my
promise
but
said
réné
the
queen
mother
oh
said
charles
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
if
you
are
attacked
defend
yourself
sire
may
i
leave
france
where
i
feel
that
my
life
is
in
danger
i
will
reply
to
that
in
a
fortnight
but
in
the
meantime
charles
frowned
and
placed
his
finger
on
his
livid
lips
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
me
sire
and
happy
to
have
escaped
so
easily
the
florentine
bowed
and
withdrew
behind
him
the
nurse
appeared
at
the
door
of
her
room
what
is
the
matter
my
charlot
said
she
nurse
i
have
been
walking
in
the
dew
and
have
taken
cold
you
are
very
pale
charlot
it
is
because
i
am
so
weak
give
me
your
arm
nurse
as
far
as
my
bed
the
nurse
hastily
came
forward
charles
leaned
on
her
and
reached
his
room
now
said
charles
i
will
put
myself
to
bed
if
maître
ambroise
paré
comes
tell
him
that
i
am
better
and
that
i
do
not
need
him
but
meanwhile
what
will
you
take
oh
a
very
simple
medicine
said
charles
the
whites
of
eggs
beaten
in
milk
by
the
way
nurse
he
continued
my
poor
actéon
is
dead
morning
he
must
be
buried
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
of
the
louvre
he
was
one
of
my
best
friends
i
will
have
a
tomb
made
for
him
if
i
have
time
chapter
liv
the
forest
of
vincennes
according
to
the
order
given
by
charles
henry
was
conducted
that
same
evening
to
vincennes
such
was
the
name
given
at
that
time
to
the
famous
castle
of
which
only
a
fragment
remains
colossal
enough
however
to
give
an
idea
of
its
past
grandeur
the
trip
was
made
in
a
litter
on
either
side
of
which
walked
four
guards
monsieur
de
nancey
bearing
the
order
which
was
to
open
to
henry
the
door
of
the
protecting
abode
walked
first
at
the
postern
of
the
prison
they
stopped
monsieur
de
nancey
dismounted
from
his
horse
opened
the
gate
which
was
closed
with
a
padlock
and
respectfully
asked
the
king
to
follow
henry
obeyed
without
uttering
a
word
any
dwelling
seemed
to
him
safer
than
the
louvre
and
ten
doors
closed
on
him
were
at
the
same
time
ten
doors
shut
between
him
and
catharine
de
médicis
the
royal
prisoner
crossed
the
drawbridge
between
two
soldiers
passed
through
the
three
doors
on
the
ground
floor
and
the
three
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
then
still
preceded
by
monsieur
de
nancey
he
ascended
one
flight
arrived
there
the
captain
of
the
guards
seeing
that
the
king
was
about
to
mount
another
flight
said
to
him
my
lord
you
are
to
stop
here
ah
said
henry
pausing
it
seems
that
i
am
given
the
honors
of
the
first
floor
sire
replied
monsieur
de
nancey
you
are
treated
like
a
crowned
head
the
devil
the
devil
said
henry
to
himself
two
or
three
floors
more
would
in
no
way
have
humiliated
me
i
shall
be
too
comfortable
here
i
suspect
something
will
your
majesty
follow
me
asked
monsieur
de
nancey
saint
gris
said
the
king
of
navarre
you
know
very
well
monsieur
that
it
is
not
a
question
of
what
i
will
or
will
not
do
but
of
what
my
brother
charles
orders
did
he
command
that
i
should
follow
you
yes
sire
then
i
will
do
so
monsieur
they
reached
a
sort
of
corridor
at
the
end
of
which
they
came
to
a
room
with
dark
and
gloomy
looking
walls
henry
gazed
around
him
with
a
glance
not
wholly
free
from
anxiety
where
are
we
he
asked
in
the
chamber
of
torture
my
lord
ah
replied
the
king
looking
at
it
more
closely
there
was
something
of
everything
in
this
chamber
pitchers
and
wooden
horses
for
the
torture
by
water
wedges
and
mallets
for
the
torture
of
the
boot
besides
stone
benches
nearly
all
around
the
room
for
the
wretches
who
awaited
the
torture
above
these
benches
at
the
seats
themselves
and
at
their
feet
were
iron
rings
fastened
into
the
walls
without
other
symmetry
than
that
of
the
torturing
art
but
their
proximity
to
the
seats
sufficiently
indicated
that
they
were
there
in
order
to
await
the
limbs
of
those
who
were
to
occupy
them
henry
walked
on
without
a
word
but
not
a
single
detail
of
all
the
hideous
apparatus
which
so
to
speak
had
stamped
the
history
of
suffering
on
the
walls
escaped
him
the
king
was
so
taken
up
with
the
objects
about
him
that
he
forgot
to
look
where
he
was
going
and
came
to
a
sudden
standstill
ah
said
he
what
is
that
and
he
pointed
to
a
kind
of
ditch
dug
in
the
damp
pavement
which
formed
the
floor
that
is
the
gutter
sire
does
it
rain
here
then
yes
sire
blood
ah
said
henry
very
good
shall
we
not
soon
reach
my
apartment
yes
my
lord
here
it
is
said
a
figure
in
the
dark
which
as
it
drew
nearer
became
clearer
and
more
distinguishable
henry
thought
he
recognized
the
voice
and
advanced
towards
the
figure
so
it
is
you
beaulieu
said
he
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
here
sire
i
have
just
received
my
appointment
as
governor
of
the
fortress
of
vincennes
well
my
dear
friend
your
initiation
does
you
honor
a
king
for
a
prisoner
is
not
bad
pardon
me
sire
said
beaulieu
but
i
have
already
had
two
gentlemen
who
are
they
but
pardon
me
perhaps
i
am
indiscreet
if
so
assume
that
i
have
said
nothing
my
lord
i
have
not
been
ordered
to
keep
it
secret
they
are
monsieur
de
la
mole
and
monsieur
de
coconnas
ah
that
is
true
i
saw
them
arrested
poor
gentlemen
and
how
do
they
bear
this
misfortune
differently
one
is
gay
the
other
sad
one
sings
the
other
groans
which
one
groans
monsieur
de
la
mole
sire
faith
said
henry
i
can
understand
more
easily
the
one
who
groans
than
the
one
who
sings
after
what
i
have
seen
the
prison
is
not
a
very
lively
place
on
what
floor
are
they
high
up
on
the
fourth
henry
heaved
a
sigh
it
was
there
that
he
wished
to
be
come
monsieur
de
beaulieu
said
he
be
good
enough
to
show
me
my
room
i
am
in
haste
to
see
it
as
i
am
greatly
fatigued
from
the
journey
we
have
just
made
this
is
it
my
lord
said
beaulieu
pointing
to
an
open
door
number
two
said
henry
why
not
number
one
because
that
is
reserved
my
lord
ah
it
seems
then
that
you
expect
a
prisoner
of
higher
rank
than
i
i
did
not
say
my
lord
that
it
was
a
prisoner
who
is
it
then
i
beg
my
lord
not
to
insist
for
by
refusing
to
answer
i
should
fail
in
the
obedience
due
him
ah
that
is
another
thing
said
henry
and
he
became
more
pensive
than
before
number
one
perplexed
him
apparently
the
governor
was
assiduous
in
his
attentions
with
a
thousand
apologies
he
installed
henry
in
his
apartment
made
every
excuse
for
the
comforts
he
might
lack
stationed
two
soldiers
at
the
door
and
withdrew
now
said
the
governor
addressing
the
turnkey
let
us
go
to
the
others
the
turnkey
walked
ahead
they
took
the
same
road
by
which
they
had
come
passed
through
the
chamber
of
torture
crossed
the
corridor
and
reached
the
stairway
then
still
following
his
guide
monsieur
de
beaulieu
ascended
three
flights
on
reaching
the
fourth
floor
the
turnkey
opened
successively
three
doors
each
ornamented
with
two
locks
and
three
enormous
bolts
he
had
scarcely
touched
the
third
door
before
they
heard
a
joyous
voice
exclaiming
by
heaven
open
if
only
to
give
us
some
air
your
stove
is
so
warm
that
i
am
stifled
here
and
coconnas
whom
the
reader
has
no
doubt
already
recognized
from
his
favorite
exclamation
bounded
from
where
he
stood
to
the
door
one
instant
my
gentleman
said
the
turnkey
i
have
not
come
to
let
you
out
but
to
let
myself
in
and
the
governor
is
with
me
the
governor
said
coconnas
what
does
he
want
to
pay
you
a
visit
he
does
me
great
honor
said
coconnas
and
he
is
welcome
monsieur
de
beaulieu
entered
and
at
once
dispelled
the
cordial
smile
of
coconnas
by
one
of
those
icy
looks
which
belong
to
governors
of
fortresses
to
jailers
and
to
hangmen
have
you
any
money
monsieur
he
asked
of
the
prisoner
i
said
coconnas
not
a
crown
jewels
i
have
a
ring
will
you
allow
me
to
search
you
by
heaven
cried
coconnas
reddening
with
anger
you
take
much
on
yourself
being
in
prison
and
having
me
there
also
we
must
suffer
everything
for
the
service
of
the
king
so
said
the
piedmontese
those
good
fellows
who
rob
on
the
pont
neuf
are
like
you
then
in
the
service
of
the
king
by
heavens
i
was
very
unjust
monsieur
for
until
now
i
have
taken
them
for
thieves
good
evening
monsieur
said
beaulieu
jailer
lock
the
door
the
governor
went
away
taking
with
him
the
ring
which
was
a
beautiful
sapphire
given
him
by
madame
de
nevers
to
remind
him
of
the
color
of
her
eyes
now
for
the
other
he
said
as
he
went
out
they
crossed
an
empty
chamber
and
the
game
of
three
doors
six
locks
and
nine
bolts
began
anew
the
last
door
open
a
sigh
was
the
first
sound
that
greeted
the
visitors
the
apartment
was
more
gloomy
looking
than
the
one
monsieur
de
beaulieu
had
just
left
four
long
narrow
windows
admitted
a
feeble
light
into
this
mournful
abode
before
these
iron
bars
were
crossed
in
such
a
way
that
the
eye
of
the
prisoner
was
arrested
by
a
dark
line
and
prevented
from
catching
even
a
glimpse
of
the
sky
from
each
corner
of
the
room
pointed
arches
met
in
the
middle
of
the
ceiling
where
they
spread
out
in
gothic
fashion
la
mole
was
seated
in
a
corner
and
in
spite
of
the
entrance
of
the
visitors
appeared
to
have
heard
nothing
the
governor
paused
on
the
threshold
and
looked
for
an
instant
at
the
prisoner
who
sat
motionless
his
head
in
his
hands
good
evening
monsieur
de
la
mole
said
beaulieu
the
young
man
slowly
raised
his
head
good
evening
monsieur
said
he
monsieur
continued
the
governor
i
have
come
to
search
you
that
is
useless
said
la
mole
i
will
give
you
all
i
have
what
have
you
about
three
hundred
crowns
these
jewels
and
rings
give
them
to
me
monsieur
said
the
governor
here
they
are
la
mole
turned
out
his
pockets
took
the
rings
from
his
finger
and
the
clasp
from
his
hat
have
you
nothing
more
not
that
i
know
of
and
that
silk
cord
around
your
neck
what
may
that
be
asked
the
governor
monsieur
that
is
not
a
jewel
but
a
relic
give
it
to
me
what
you
demand
it
i
am
ordered
to
leave
you
only
your
clothes
and
a
relic
is
not
an
article
of
clothing
la
mole
made
a
gesture
of
anger
which
in
the
midst
of
the
dignified
and
pained
calm
which
distinguished
him
seemed
to
impress
the
men
accustomed
to
stormy
emotions
but
he
immediately
recovered
his
very
well
monsieur
said
he
you
shall
see
what
you
ask
for
then
turning
as
if
to
approach
the
light
he
unfastened
the
pretended
relic
which
was
none
other
than
a
medallion
containing
a
portrait
which
he
drew
out
and
raised
to
his
lips
having
kissed
it
several
times
he
suddenly
pretended
to
drop
it
as
by
accident
and
placing
the
heel
of
his
boot
on
it
he
crushed
it
into
a
thousand
pieces
monsieur
said
the
governor
and
he
stooped
down
to
see
if
he
could
not
save
the
unknown
object
which
la
mole
wished
to
hide
from
him
but
the
miniature
was
literally
ground
to
powder
the
king
wished
for
this
jewel
said
la
mole
but
he
had
no
right
to
the
portrait
it
contained
now
here
is
the
medallion
you
may
take
it
monsieur
said
beaulieu
i
shall
complain
of
you
to
the
king
and
without
taking
leave
of
his
prisoner
by
a
single
word
he
went
out
so
angry
that
without
waiting
to
preside
over
the
task
he
left
to
the
turnkey
the
care
of
closing
the
doors
the
jailer
turned
to
leave
but
seeing
that
monsieur
de
beaulieu
had
already
started
down
the
stairs
faith
monsieur
said
he
turning
back
i
did
well
to
ask
you
to
give
me
the
hundred
crowns
at
once
for
which
i
am
to
allow
you
to
speak
to
your
companion
for
had
you
not
done
so
the
governor
would
have
taken
them
from
you
with
the
three
hundred
others
and
my
conscience
would
not
have
allowed
me
to
do
anything
for
you
but
as
i
was
paid
in
advance
i
promised
that
you
should
see
your
friend
so
come
an
honest
man
keeps
his
word
only
if
it
is
possible
for
your
sake
as
much
as
for
mine
do
not
talk
politics
la
mole
left
his
apartment
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
coconnas
who
was
walking
up
and
down
the
flags
of
the
intermediate
room
the
two
friends
rushed
into
each
other
arms
the
jailer
pretended
to
wipe
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
then
withdrew
to
watch
that
the
prisoners
were
not
surprised
or
rather
that
he
himself
was
not
caught
ah
here
you
are
said
coconnas
well
has
that
dreadful
governor
paid
his
visit
to
you
yes
as
he
did
to
you
i
presume
did
he
remove
everything
and
from
you
too
ah
i
had
not
much
only
a
ring
from
henrietta
that
was
all
and
money
i
gave
all
i
had
to
the
good
jailer
so
that
he
would
arrange
this
interview
for
us
ah
said
la
mole
it
seems
that
he
had
something
from
both
of
us
did
you
pay
him
too
i
gave
him
a
hundred
crowns
so
much
the
better
one
can
do
everything
with
money
and
i
trust
that
we
shall
not
lack
for
it
do
you
know
what
has
happened
to
us
perfectly
we
have
been
betrayed
by
that
scoundrelly
duc
i
should
have
been
right
to
twist
his
neck
do
you
think
our
position
serious
i
fear
so
then
there
is
likelihood
of
the
torture
i
will
not
hide
from
you
the
fact
that
i
have
already
thought
of
it
what
should
you
do
in
that
case
and
you
i
should
be
silent
replied
la
mole
with
a
feverish
flush
silent
cried
coconnas
yes
if
i
had
the
strength
well
said
coconnas
if
they
insult
me
in
any
such
way
i
promise
you
i
will
tell
them
a
few
things
what
things
asked
la
mole
quickly
oh
be
easy
things
which
will
prevent
monsieur
from
sleeping
for
some
time
la
mole
was
about
to
reply
when
the
jailer
who
no
doubt
had
heard
some
noise
appeared
and
pushing
each
prisoner
into
his
respective
cell
locked
the
doors
again
chapter
lv
the
figure
of
wax
for
a
week
charles
was
confined
to
his
bed
by
a
slow
fever
interrupted
by
violent
attacks
which
resembled
epileptic
fits
during
these
attacks
he
uttered
shrieks
which
the
guards
watching
in
his
chamber
heard
with
terror
and
the
echoes
of
which
reached
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
old
louvre
aroused
so
often
by
many
a
dreadful
sound
then
when
these
attacks
passed
charles
completely
exhausted
sank
back
with
closed
eyes
into
the
arms
of
his
nurse
to
say
that
each
in
his
way
without
communicating
the
feeling
to
the
other
for
mother
and
son
sought
to
avoid
rather
than
to
see
each
other
to
say
that
catharine
de
médicis
and
the
duc
revolved
sinister
thoughts
in
the
depths
of
their
hearts
would
be
to
say
that
in
that
nest
of
vipers
moved
a
hideous
swarm
henry
was
shut
up
in
his
chamber
in
the
prison
and
at
his
own
request
no
one
had
been
allowed
to
see
him
not
even
marguerite
in
the
eyes
of
every
one
his
imprisonment
was
an
open
disgrace
catharine
and
thinking
him
lost
breathed
once
more
and
henry
ate
and
drank
more
calmly
hoping
that
he
was
forgotten
at
court
no
one
suspected
the
cause
of
the
king
illness
maître
ambroise
paré
and
mazille
his
colleague
thought
it
was
inflammation
of
the
bowels
and
had
prescribed
a
regimen
which
aided
the
special
drink
given
by
réné
charles
received
this
his
only
nourishment
three
times
a
day
from
the
hands
of
his
nurse
la
mole
and
coconnas
were
at
vincennes
in
closest
confinement
marguerite
and
madame
de
nevers
had
made
a
dozen
attempts
to
reach
them
or
at
least
to
send
them
a
note
but
without
success
one
morning
charles
felt
somewhat
better
and
wished
the
court
to
assemble
this
was
the
usual
custom
in
the
morning
although
for
some
time
no
levee
had
taken
place
the
doors
were
accordingly
thrown
open
and
it
was
easy
to
see
from
his
pale
cheeks
yellow
forehead
and
the
feverish
light
in
his
eyes
which
were
surrounded
by
dark
circles
what
frightful
ravages
the
unknown
disease
had
made
on
the
young
monarch
the
royal
chamber
was
soon
filled
with
curious
and
interested
courtiers
catharine
and
marguerite
had
been
informed
that
the
king
was
to
hold
an
audience
therefore
all
three
entered
at
short
intervals
one
by
one
catharine
calm
smiling
marguerite
dejected
catharine
seated
herself
by
the
side
of
the
bed
without
noticing
the
look
that
charles
gave
her
as
he
saw
her
approach
monsieur
stood
at
the
foot
marguerite
leaned
against
a
table
and
seeing
the
pale
brow
the
worn
features
and
eyes
of
her
brother
could
not
repress
a
sigh
and
a
tear
charles
whom
nothing
escaped
saw
the
tear
and
heard
the
sigh
and
with
his
head
made
a
slight
motion
to
marguerite
this
sign
slight
as
it
was
lighted
the
face
of
the
poor
queen
of
navarre
to
whom
henry
had
not
had
time
or
perhaps
had
not
wished
to
say
anything
she
feared
for
her
husband
she
trembled
for
her
lover
for
herself
she
had
no
fear
she
knew
la
mole
well
and
felt
she
could
rely
on
him
well
my
dear
son
said
catharine
how
do
you
feel
better
mother
better
what
do
your
physicians
say
my
physicians
they
are
clever
doctors
mother
said
charles
bursting
into
a
laugh
i
take
great
pleasure
i
admit
in
hearing
them
discuss
my
malady
nurse
give
me
something
to
drink
the
nurse
brought
charles
a
cup
of
his
usual
beverage
what
do
they
order
you
to
take
my
son
oh
madame
who
knows
anything
about
their
preparations
said
the
king
hastily
swallowing
the
drink
what
my
brother
needs
said
françois
is
to
rise
and
get
out
into
the
open
air
hunting
of
which
he
is
so
fond
would
do
him
a
great
deal
of
good
yes
said
charles
with
a
smile
the
meaning
of
which
it
was
impossible
for
the
duke
to
understand
and
yet
the
last
hunt
did
me
great
harm
charles
uttered
these
words
in
such
a
strange
way
that
the
conversation
in
which
the
others
present
had
not
taken
part
stopped
then
the
king
gave
a
slight
nod
of
his
head
the
courtiers
understood
that
the
audience
was
over
and
withdrew
one
after
another
started
to
approach
his
brother
but
some
secret
feeling
stopped
him
he
bowed
and
went
out
marguerite
seized
the
wasted
hand
her
brother
held
out
to
her
pressed
it
and
kissed
it
then
she
in
turn
withdrew
dear
margot
murmured
charles
catharine
alone
remained
keeping
her
place
at
the
side
of
the
bed
finding
himself
alone
with
her
charles
recoiled
as
if
from
a
serpent
instructed
by
the
words
of
réné
perhaps
still
better
by
silence
and
meditation
charles
no
longer
had
even
the
happiness
of
doubt
he
knew
perfectly
to
whom
and
to
what
to
attribute
his
approaching
death
so
when
catharine
drew
near
to
the
bed
and
extended
to
him
a
hand
as
cold
as
his
glance
the
king
shuddered
in
fear
you
have
remained
madame
said
he
yes
my
son
replied
catharine
i
must
speak
to
you
on
important
matters
speak
madame
said
charles
again
recoiling
sire
said
the
queen
you
said
just
now
that
your
physicians
were
great
doctors
and
i
say
so
again
madame
yet
what
have
they
done
during
your
illness
nothing
it
is
true
but
if
you
had
heard
what
they
said
really
madame
one
might
afford
to
be
ill
if
only
to
listen
to
their
learned
discussions
well
my
son
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
something
what
is
it
mother
i
suspect
that
all
these
clever
doctors
know
nothing
whatever
about
your
malady
indeed
madame
they
may
perhaps
see
a
result
but
they
are
ignorant
of
the
cause
that
is
possible
said
charles
not
understanding
what
his
mother
was
aiming
at
so
that
they
treat
the
symptoms
and
not
the
ill
itself
on
my
soul
said
charles
astonished
i
believe
you
are
right
mother
well
my
son
said
catharine
as
it
is
good
neither
for
my
happiness
nor
the
welfare
of
the
kingdom
for
you
to
be
ill
so
long
and
as
your
mind
might
end
by
becoming
affected
i
assembled
the
most
skilful
doctors
in
the
science
of
medicine
madame
no
in
a
more
profound
science
that
which
helps
not
only
the
body
but
the
mind
as
well
ah
a
beautiful
science
madame
said
charles
and
one
which
the
doctors
are
right
in
not
teaching
to
crowned
heads
have
your
researches
had
any
result
he
continued
yes
what
was
it
that
which
i
hoped
for
i
bring
to
your
majesty
that
which
will
cure
not
only
your
body
but
your
mind
charles
shuddered
he
thought
that
finding
that
he
was
still
living
his
mother
had
resolved
to
finish
knowingly
that
which
she
had
begun
unconsciously
where
is
this
remedy
said
he
rising
on
his
elbow
and
looking
at
his
mother
in
the
disease
itself
replied
catharine
then
where
is
that
listen
to
me
my
son
said
catharine
have
you
not
sometimes
heard
it
said
that
there
are
secret
enemies
who
in
their
revenge
assassinate
their
victim
from
a
distance
by
steel
or
poison
asked
charles
without
once
turning
his
eyes
from
the
impassible
face
of
his
mother
no
by
a
surer
and
much
more
terrible
means
said
catharine
explain
yourself
my
son
asked
the
florentine
do
you
believe
in
charms
and
magic
charles
repressed
a
smile
of
scorn
and
incredulity
fully
said
he
well
said
catharine
quickly
from
magic
comes
all
your
suffering
an
enemy
of
your
majesty
who
would
not
have
dared
to
attack
you
openly
has
conspired
in
secret
he
has
directed
against
your
majesty
a
conspiracy
much
more
terrible
in
that
he
has
no
accomplices
and
the
mysterious
threads
of
which
can
not
be
traced
faith
no
said
charles
aghast
at
such
cunning
think
well
my
son
said
catharine
and
recall
to
mind
certain
plans
for
flight
which
would
have
assured
impunity
to
the
murderer
to
the
murderer
cried
charles
to
the
murderer
you
say
has
there
been
an
attempt
to
kill
me
mother
catharine
changing
eye
rolled
hypocritically
under
its
wrinkled
lid
yes
my
son
you
doubt
it
perhaps
but
i
know
it
for
a
certainty
i
never
doubt
what
you
tell
me
mother
replied
the
king
bitterly
how
was
the
attempt
made
i
am
anxious
to
know
by
magic
explain
yourself
madame
said
charles
recalled
by
his
loathing
to
his
rôle
of
observer
if
the
conspirator
i
mean
and
one
whom
at
heart
your
majesty
already
suspects
had
succeeded
in
his
plans
no
one
would
have
fathomed
the
cause
of
your
majesty
sufferings
fortunately
however
sire
your
brother
watched
over
you
which
brother
ah
yes
that
is
true
i
always
forget
that
i
have
a
brother
murmured
charles
laughing
bitterly
so
you
say
madame
that
fortunately
he
revealed
the
conspiracy
but
while
he
inexperienced
child
that
he
is
sought
only
the
traces
of
an
ordinary
plot
the
proofs
of
a
young
man
escapade
i
sought
for
proofs
of
a
much
more
important
deed
for
i
understand
the
reach
of
the
guilty
mind
ah
mother
one
would
say
you
were
speaking
of
the
king
of
navarre
said
charles
anxious
to
see
how
far
this
florentine
dissimulation
would
go
catharine
hypocritically
dropped
her
eyes
i
have
had
him
arrested
and
taken
to
vincennes
for
his
escapade
continued
the
king
is
he
more
guilty
than
i
suspected
then
do
you
feel
the
fever
that
consumes
you
asked
catharine
yes
certainly
madame
said
charles
frowning
do
you
feel
the
fire
that
burns
you
internally
yes
madame
replied
charles
his
brow
darkening
more
and
more
and
the
sharp
pains
in
your
head
which
shoot
from
your
eyes
to
your
brain
like
so
many
arrows
yes
madame
i
feel
all
that
you
describe
my
trouble
perfectly
well
the
explanation
is
very
simple
said
the
florentine
see
and
she
drew
from
under
her
cloak
an
object
which
she
gave
to
the
king
it
was
a
figure
of
yellow
wax
about
six
inches
high
clothed
in
a
robe
covered
with
golden
stars
also
of
wax
like
the
figure
and
over
this
a
royal
mantle
of
the
same
material
well
asked
charles
what
is
this
little
statue
see
what
it
has
on
its
head
said
catharine
a
crown
replied
charles
and
in
the
heart
a
needle
well
sire
do
you
recognize
yourself
myself
yes
you
with
your
crown
and
mantle
who
made
this
figure
asked
charles
whom
this
farce
was
beginning
to
weary
the
king
of
navarre
no
doubt
no
sire
no
then
i
do
not
understand
you
i
say
replied
catharine
because
you
asked
the
question
literally
i
should
have
said
had
you
put
it
differently
charles
made
no
answer
he
was
striving
to
penetrate
all
the
thoughts
of
that
shadowy
mind
which
constantly
closed
before
him
just
as
he
thought
himself
ready
to
read
it
sire
continued
catharine
this
statue
was
found
by
the
laguesle
in
the
apartment
of
the
man
who
on
the
day
you
last
went
hawking
led
a
horse
for
the
king
of
navarre
monsieur
de
la
mole
yes
and
if
you
please
look
again
at
the
needle
in
the
heart
and
see
what
letter
is
written
on
the
label
attached
to
it
i
see
an
said
charles
that
means
death
it
is
the
magic
formula
sire
the
maker
thus
wrote
his
vow
on
the
very
wound
he
gave
had
he
wished
to
make
a
pretence
at
killing
as
did
the
duc
de
bretagne
for
king
charles
he
would
have
driven
the
needle
into
the
head
and
put
an
instead
of
an
so
said
charles
according
to
your
idea
the
person
who
seeks
to
end
my
days
is
monsieur
de
la
mole
yes
he
is
the
dagger
but
behind
the
dagger
is
the
hand
that
directs
it
this
then
is
the
sole
cause
of
my
illness
the
day
the
charm
is
destroyed
the
malady
will
cease
but
how
go
to
work
asked
charles
you
must
know
mother
but
i
unlike
you
who
have
spent
your
whole
life
studying
them
know
nothing
about
charms
and
spells
the
death
of
the
conspirator
destroys
the
charm
that
is
all
the
day
the
charm
is
destroyed
your
illness
will
cease
said
catharine
indeed
said
charles
with
an
air
of
surprise
did
you
not
know
that
why
i
am
no
sorcerer
said
the
king
well
now
said
catharine
your
majesty
is
convinced
are
you
not
certainly
conviction
has
dispelled
anxiety
completely
you
do
not
say
so
out
of
complaisance
no
mother
i
say
it
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
catharine
face
broke
into
smiles
thank
god
she
exclaimed
as
if
she
believed
in
god
yes
thank
god
repeated
charles
ironically
i
know
now
as
you
do
to
whom
to
attribute
my
present
condition
and
consequently
whom
to
punish
and
you
will
punish
monsieur
de
la
mole
did
you
not
say
that
he
was
the
guilty
party
i
said
that
he
was
the
instrument
well
said
charles
monsieur
de
la
mole
first
he
is
the
most
important
all
these
attacks
on
me
might
arouse
dangerous
suspicions
it
is
imperative
that
there
be
some
light
thrown
on
the
matter
and
from
this
light
the
truth
may
be
discovered
so
monsieur
de
la
mole
suits
me
admirably
as
the
guilty
one
therefore
i
accept
him
we
will
begin
with
him
and
if
he
has
an
accomplice
he
shall
speak
yes
murmured
catharine
and
if
he
does
not
we
will
make
him
we
have
infallible
means
for
that
then
rising
will
you
permit
the
trial
to
begin
sire
i
desire
it
madame
replied
charles
and
the
sooner
the
better
catharine
pressed
the
hand
of
her
son
without
comprehending
the
nervous
grasp
with
which
he
returned
it
and
left
the
apartment
without
hearing
the
sardonic
laugh
of
the
king
or
the
terrible
oath
which
followed
the
laugh
charles
wondered
if
it
were
not
dangerous
to
let
this
woman
go
thus
for
in
a
few
hours
she
would
have
done
so
much
that
there
would
be
no
way
of
stopping
it
as
he
watched
the
curtain
fall
after
catharine
he
heard
a
light
rustle
behind
him
and
turning
he
perceived
marguerite
who
raised
the
drapery
before
the
corridor
leading
to
his
nurse
rooms
marguerite
pallor
her
haggard
eyes
and
oppressed
breathing
betrayed
the
most
violent
emotion
oh
sire
sire
she
exclaimed
rushing
to
her
brother
bedside
you
know
that
she
lies
she
who
asked
charles
listen
charles
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
accuse
one
mother
but
i
suspected
that
she
remained
with
you
to
persecute
them
again
but
on
my
life
on
yours
on
our
souls
i
tell
you
what
she
says
is
false
to
persecute
them
whom
is
she
persecuting
both
had
instinctively
lowered
their
voices
it
seemed
as
if
they
themselves
feared
even
to
hear
them
henry
in
the
first
place
your
henriot
who
loves
you
who
is
more
devoted
to
you
than
any
one
else
you
think
so
margot
said
charles
oh
sire
i
am
sure
of
it
well
so
am
i
said
charles
then
if
you
are
sure
of
it
brother
said
marguerite
surprised
why
did
you
have
him
arrested
and
taken
to
vincennes
because
he
asked
me
to
do
so
he
asked
you
sire
yes
henriot
has
singular
ideas
perhaps
he
is
wrong
perhaps
right
at
any
rate
one
of
his
ideas
was
that
he
would
be
safer
in
disgrace
than
in
favor
away
from
me
at
vincennes
instead
of
near
me
in
the
louvre
ah
i
see
said
marguerite
and
is
he
safe
there
as
safe
as
a
man
can
be
whose
head
beaulieu
answers
for
with
his
own
oh
thank
you
brother
so
much
for
henry
but
but
what
there
is
another
sire
in
whom
perhaps
i
am
wrong
to
be
interested
but
who
is
it
sire
spare
me
i
would
scarcely
dare
name
him
to
my
brother
much
less
to
my
king
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
it
not
said
charles
alas
said
marguerite
you
tried
to
kill
him
once
sire
and
he
escaped
from
your
royal
vengeance
only
by
a
miracle
he
was
guilty
of
only
one
crime
then
marguerite
now
he
has
committed
two
sire
he
is
not
guilty
of
the
second
but
said
charles
did
you
not
hear
what
our
good
mother
said
my
poor
margot
oh
i
have
already
told
you
charles
said
marguerite
lowering
her
voice
that
what
she
said
was
false
you
do
not
know
perhaps
that
a
waxen
figure
has
been
found
in
monsieur
de
la
mole
rooms
yes
yes
brother
i
know
it
that
this
figure
is
pierced
to
the
heart
by
a
needle
and
that
it
bears
a
tag
with
an
on
it
i
know
that
too
and
that
over
the
shoulders
of
the
figure
is
a
royal
mantle
and
that
on
its
head
is
a
royal
crown
i
know
all
that
well
what
have
you
to
say
to
it
this
that
the
figure
with
a
royal
cloak
and
a
crown
on
its
head
is
that
of
a
woman
and
not
that
of
a
man
bah
said
charles
and
the
needle
in
its
heart
was
a
charm
to
make
himself
beloved
by
this
woman
and
not
a
charm
to
kill
a
man
but
the
letter
it
does
not
mean
as
the
queen
mother
said
what
does
it
mean
then
asked
charles
it
means
it
means
the
name
of
the
woman
whom
monsieur
de
la
mole
loves
and
what
is
the
name
of
this
woman
brother
cried
the
queen
of
navarre
falling
on
her
knees
before
the
king
bed
taking
his
hand
between
both
of
hers
and
pressing
her
face
to
it
bathed
in
tears
hush
sister
said
charles
casting
a
sharp
glance
about
him
beneath
his
frowning
brow
for
just
as
you
overheard
a
moment
ago
we
may
now
be
overheard
again
what
does
it
matter
exclaimed
marguerite
raising
her
head
if
the
whole
world
were
present
to
hear
me
i
would
declare
before
it
that
it
is
infamous
to
abuse
the
love
of
a
gentleman
by
staining
his
reputation
with
a
suspicion
of
murder
margot
suppose
i
were
to
tell
you
that
i
know
as
well
as
you
do
who
it
is
and
who
it
is
not
brother
suppose
i
were
to
tell
you
that
monsieur
de
la
mole
is
innocent
you
know
this
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
i
know
the
real
author
of
the
crime
the
real
author
cried
marguerite
has
there
been
a
crime
committed
then
yes
intentionally
or
unintentionally
there
has
been
a
crime
committed
on
you
yes
impossible
impossible
look
at
me
margot
the
young
woman
looked
at
her
brother
and
trembled
seeing
him
so
pale
margot
i
have
not
three
months
to
live
said
charles
you
brother
you
charles
she
cried
margot
i
am
poisoned
marguerite
screamed
hush
said
charles
it
must
be
thought
that
i
am
dying
by
magic
do
you
know
who
is
guilty
yes
you
said
it
was
not
la
mole
no
it
is
not
he
nor
henry
either
surely
great
god
could
it
be
who
my
brother
murmured
marguerite
perhaps
or
or
marguerite
lowered
her
voice
as
if
frightened
at
what
she
was
going
to
say
or
our
mother
charles
was
silent
marguerite
looked
at
him
and
read
all
that
she
asked
in
his
eyes
then
still
on
her
knees
she
half
fell
over
against
a
chair
oh
my
god
my
god
she
whispered
that
is
impossible
impossible
said
charles
with
a
strident
laugh
it
is
a
pity
réné
is
not
here
to
tell
you
the
story
réné
yes
he
would
tell
you
that
a
woman
to
whom
he
dares
refuse
nothing
asked
him
for
a
book
on
hunting
which
was
in
his
library
that
a
subtle
poison
was
poured
on
every
page
of
this
book
that
the
poison
intended
for
some
one
i
know
not
for
whom
fell
by
a
turn
of
chance
or
by
a
punishment
of
heaven
on
another
but
in
the
absence
of
réné
if
you
wish
to
see
the
book
it
is
there
in
my
closet
and
written
in
the
florentine
handwriting
you
will
see
that
this
volume
which
still
contains
the
death
of
many
among
its
pages
was
given
by
him
to
his
fellow
countrywoman
hush
charles
hush
said
marguerite
now
you
see
that
it
must
be
supposed
that
i
die
of
magic
but
it
is
monstrous
monstrous
pity
pity
you
know
he
is
innocent
yes
i
know
it
but
he
must
be
thought
guilty
let
your
lover
die
it
is
very
little
to
do
in
order
to
save
the
honor
of
the
house
of
france
i
myself
shall
die
that
the
secret
may
die
with
me
marguerite
bent
her
head
realizing
that
nothing
could
be
obtained
from
the
king
towards
saving
la
mole
and
withdrew
weeping
having
no
hope
except
in
her
own
resources
meantime
catharine
as
charles
had
divined
had
lost
not
a
minute
but
had
written
to
the
laguesle
a
letter
every
word
of
which
has
been
preserved
by
history
and
which
throws
a
lurid
light
upon
the
drama
le
procureur
i
have
this
evening
been
informed
beyond
a
doubt
that
la
mole
has
committed
sacrilege
many
evil
things
such
as
books
and
papers
have
been
found
in
his
apartments
in
paris
i
beg
you
to
summon
the
chief
president
and
to
inform
him
as
early
as
possible
of
the
affair
of
the
waxen
figure
meant
for
the
king
and
which
was
pierced
to
the
chapter
lvi
the
invisible
bucklers
the
day
after
that
on
which
catharine
had
written
this
letter
the
governor
entered
coconnas
cell
with
an
imposing
retinue
consisting
of
two
halberdiers
and
four
men
in
black
gowns
coconnas
was
asked
to
descend
to
a
room
in
which
the
attorney
laguesle
and
two
judges
waited
to
question
him
according
to
instructions
during
the
week
he
had
spent
in
prison
coconnas
had
reflected
a
great
deal
besides
that
he
and
la
mole
were
together
for
a
few
minutes
each
day
through
the
kindness
of
their
jailer
who
without
saying
anything
to
them
had
arranged
this
surprise
which
in
all
probability
they
did
not
owe
to
his
philosophy
alone
besides
we
say
la
mole
and
he
had
agreed
on
the
course
they
were
to
pursue
which
was
to
persist
in
absolute
denial
and
they
were
persuaded
that
with
a
little
skill
the
affair
would
take
a
more
favorable
turn
the
charges
were
no
greater
against
them
than
against
the
others
henry
and
marguerite
had
made
no
attempt
at
flight
they
could
not
therefore
be
compromised
in
an
affair
in
which
the
chief
were
free
coconnas
did
not
know
that
henry
was
in
the
prison
and
the
complaisance
of
the
jailer
told
him
that
above
his
head
hovered
a
certain
protection
which
he
called
the
up
to
then
the
examination
had
been
confined
to
the
intentions
of
the
king
of
navarre
his
plans
of
flight
and
the
part
the
two
friends
had
played
in
them
to
all
these
questions
coconnas
had
constantly
replied
in
a
way
more
than
vague
and
much
more
than
adroit
he
was
ready
still
to
reply
in
the
same
way
and
had
prepared
in
advance
all
his
little
repartees
when
he
suddenly
found
the
object
of
the
examination
was
altered
it
turned
upon
one
or
more
visits
to
réné
one
or
more
waxen
figures
made
at
the
instigation
of
la
mole
prepared
as
he
was
coconnas
believed
that
the
accusation
lost
much
of
its
intensity
since
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
having
betrayed
a
king
but
of
having
made
a
figure
of
a
queen
and
this
figure
not
more
than
ten
inches
high
at
the
most
he
therefore
replied
brightly
that
neither
he
nor
his
friend
had
played
with
a
doll
for
some
time
and
noticed
with
pleasure
that
several
times
his
answers
made
the
judges
smile
it
had
not
yet
been
said
in
verse
i
have
laughed
therefore
am
i
disarmed
but
it
had
been
said
a
great
deal
in
prose
and
coconnas
thought
that
he
had
partly
disarmed
his
judges
because
they
had
smiled
his
examination
over
he
went
back
to
his
cell
singing
so
merrily
that
la
mole
for
whom
he
was
making
all
the
noise
drew
from
it
the
happiest
auguries
la
mole
was
brought
down
and
like
coconnas
saw
with
astonishment
that
the
accusation
had
abandoned
its
first
ground
and
had
entered
a
new
field
he
was
questioned
as
to
his
visits
to
réné
he
replied
that
he
had
gone
to
the
florentine
only
once
then
if
he
had
not
ordered
a
waxen
figure
he
replied
that
réné
had
showed
him
such
a
figure
ready
made
he
was
then
asked
if
this
figure
did
not
represent
a
man
he
replied
that
it
represented
a
woman
then
if
the
object
of
the
charm
was
not
to
cause
the
death
of
the
man
he
replied
that
the
purpose
of
the
charm
was
to
cause
himself
to
be
beloved
by
the
woman
these
questions
were
put
in
a
hundred
different
forms
but
la
mole
always
replied
in
the
same
way
the
judges
looked
at
one
another
with
a
certain
indecision
not
knowing
what
to
say
or
do
before
such
simplicity
when
a
note
brought
to
the
solved
the
difficulty
the
accused
denies
resort
to
the
the
attorney
put
the
note
into
his
pocket
smiled
at
la
mole
and
politely
dismissed
him
la
mole
returned
to
his
cell
almost
as
reassured
if
not
as
joyous
as
coconnas
i
think
everything
is
going
well
said
he
an
hour
later
he
heard
footsteps
and
saw
a
note
slipped
under
his
door
without
seeing
the
hand
that
did
it
he
took
it
up
thinking
that
in
all
probability
it
came
from
the
jailer
seeing
it
a
hope
almost
as
acute
as
a
disappointment
sprang
into
his
heart
he
hoped
it
was
from
marguerite
from
whom
he
had
had
no
news
since
he
had
been
a
prisoner
he
took
it
up
with
trembling
hand
and
almost
died
of
joy
as
he
looked
at
the
handwriting
said
the
note
am
watching
over
ah
if
she
is
watching
cried
la
mole
covering
with
kisses
the
paper
which
had
touched
a
hand
so
dear
if
she
is
watching
i
am
saved
in
order
for
la
mole
to
comprehend
the
note
and
rely
with
coconnas
on
what
the
piedmontese
called
his
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
conduct
the
reader
to
that
small
house
to
that
chamber
in
which
the
reminders
of
so
many
scenes
of
intoxicating
happiness
so
many
perfumes
so
many
tender
recollections
since
become
agonizing
were
breaking
the
heart
of
a
woman
half
reclining
on
velvet
cushions
to
be
a
queen
to
be
strong
young
rich
beautiful
and
suffer
what
i
suffer
cried
this
woman
oh
it
is
impossible
then
in
her
agitation
she
rose
paced
up
and
down
stopped
suddenly
pressed
her
burning
forehead
against
the
marble
rose
pale
her
face
covered
with
tears
wrung
her
hands
and
crying
aloud
fell
back
again
hopeless
into
a
chair
suddenly
the
tapestry
which
separated
the
apartment
of
the
rue
cloche
percée
from
that
in
the
rue
tizon
was
raised
and
the
duchesse
de
nevers
entered
ah
exclaimed
marguerite
is
it
you
with
what
impatience
i
have
waited
for
you
well
what
news
bad
news
my
poor
friend
catharine
herself
is
hurrying
on
the
trial
and
at
present
is
at
vincennes
and
réné
is
arrested
before
you
were
able
to
speak
to
him
yes
and
our
prisoners
i
have
news
of
them
from
the
jailer
yes
well
well
they
see
each
other
every
day
the
day
before
yesterday
they
were
searched
la
mole
broke
your
picture
to
atoms
rather
than
give
it
up
dear
la
mole
annibal
laughed
in
the
face
of
the
inquisitors
worthy
annibal
what
then
this
morning
they
were
questioned
as
to
the
flight
of
the
king
his
projects
of
rebellion
in
navarre
and
they
said
nothing
oh
i
knew
they
would
keep
silence
but
silence
will
kill
them
as
much
as
if
they
spoke
yes
but
we
must
save
them
have
you
thought
over
our
plan
since
yesterday
i
have
thought
of
nothing
else
well
i
have
just
come
to
terms
with
beaulieu
ah
my
dear
queen
what
a
hard
and
greedy
man
it
will
cost
a
man
life
and
three
hundred
thousand
crowns
you
say
he
is
hard
and
greedy
and
yet
he
asks
only
the
life
of
a
man
and
three
hundred
thousand
crowns
why
that
is
nothing
nothing
three
hundred
thousand
crowns
why
all
your
jewels
and
all
mine
would
not
be
enough
oh
that
is
nothing
the
king
of
navarre
will
pay
something
the
duc
will
pay
part
and
my
brother
charles
will
pay
part
or
if
not
see
what
nonsense
you
talk
i
have
the
money
you
yes
i
how
did
you
get
it
ah
that
is
telling
is
it
a
secret
for
every
one
except
you
oh
my
god
said
marguerite
smiling
through
her
tears
did
you
steal
it
you
shall
judge
well
let
me
do
you
remember
that
horrible
nantouillet
the
rich
man
the
usurer
if
you
please
well
well
one
day
seeing
a
certain
blonde
lady
with
greenish
eyes
pass
by
wearing
three
rubies
one
over
her
forehead
the
other
two
over
her
temples
an
arrangement
which
was
very
becoming
to
her
this
rich
man
this
usurer
cried
out
three
kisses
in
the
place
of
those
three
rubies
i
will
give
you
three
diamonds
worth
one
hundred
thousand
crowns
apiece
well
henriette
well
my
dear
the
diamonds
appeared
and
are
sold
oh
henriette
henriette
cried
marguerite
well
exclaimed
the
duchess
in
a
bold
tone
at
once
innocent
and
sublime
which
sums
up
the
age
and
the
woman
well
i
love
annibal
that
is
true
said
marguerite
smiling
and
blushing
at
the
same
time
you
love
him
a
very
great
deal
too
much
perhaps
and
yet
she
pressed
her
friend
hand
so
continued
henriette
thanks
to
our
three
diamonds
the
three
hundred
thousand
crowns
and
the
man
are
ready
the
man
what
man
the
man
to
be
killed
you
forget
a
man
must
be
killed
have
you
found
the
necessary
man
yes
at
the
same
price
asked
marguerite
smiling
at
the
same
price
i
could
have
found
a
thousand
replied
henriette
no
no
for
five
hundred
crowns
for
five
hundred
crowns
you
have
found
a
man
who
has
consented
to
be
killed
what
can
you
expect
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
live
my
dear
friend
i
do
not
understand
you
come
explain
enigmas
require
too
much
time
to
guess
at
such
a
moment
as
this
well
listen
the
jailer
to
whom
the
keeping
of
la
mole
and
coconnas
is
entrusted
is
an
old
soldier
who
knows
what
a
wound
is
he
would
like
to
help
save
our
friends
but
he
does
not
want
to
lose
his
place
a
blow
of
a
dagger
skilfully
aimed
will
end
the
affair
we
will
give
him
a
reward
and
the
kingdom
indemnification
in
this
way
the
brave
man
will
receive
money
from
both
parties
and
will
renew
the
fable
of
the
pelican
but
said
marguerite
a
thrust
of
a
dagger
do
not
worry
annibal
will
give
it
well
said
marguerite
he
has
given
as
many
as
three
blows
of
his
sword
to
la
mole
and
la
mole
is
not
dead
there
is
therefore
every
reason
to
hope
wicked
woman
you
deserve
to
have
me
stop
oh
no
no
on
the
contrary
tell
me
the
rest
i
beg
you
how
are
we
to
save
them
come
well
this
is
the
plan
the
chapel
is
the
only
place
in
the
castle
where
women
can
enter
who
are
not
prisoners
we
are
to
be
hidden
behind
the
altar
under
the
altar
cloth
they
will
find
two
daggers
the
door
of
the
will
be
opened
beforehand
coconnas
will
strike
the
jailer
who
will
fall
and
pretend
to
be
dead
we
appear
each
of
us
throws
a
cloak
over
the
shoulders
of
her
friend
we
run
with
them
through
the
small
doors
of
the
and
as
we
have
the
password
we
can
leave
without
hindrance
and
once
out
two
horses
will
be
waiting
at
the
door
the
men
will
spring
on
them
leave
france
and
reach
lorraine
whence
now
and
then
they
will
return
incognito
oh
you
restore
me
to
life
said
marguerite
so
we
shall
save
them
i
am
almost
sure
of
it
soon
in
three
or
four
days
beaulieu
is
to
let
us
know
but
if
you
were
recognized
in
the
vicinity
of
vincennes
that
might
upset
our
plan
how
could
any
one
recognize
me
i
go
there
as
a
nun
with
a
hood
thanks
to
which
not
even
the
tip
of
my
nose
is
visible
we
can
not
take
too
many
precautions
i
know
that
well
enough
by
heaven
as
poor
annibal
would
say
did
you
hear
anything
about
the
king
of
navarre
i
was
careful
to
ask
well
well
he
has
never
been
so
happy
apparently
he
laughs
sings
eats
drinks
and
sleeps
well
and
asks
only
one
thing
and
that
is
to
be
well
guarded
he
is
right
and
my
mother
i
told
you
she
is
hurrying
on
the
trial
as
fast
as
she
can
yes
but
does
she
suspect
anything
about
us
how
could
she
every
one
who
has
a
secret
is
anxious
to
keep
it
ah
i
know
that
she
told
the
judges
in
paris
to
be
in
readiness
let
us
act
quickly
henriette
if
our
poor
prisoners
change
their
abode
everything
will
have
to
be
done
over
again
do
not
worry
i
am
as
anxious
as
you
to
see
them
free
oh
yes
i
know
that
and
thank
you
thank
you
a
hundred
times
for
all
you
have
done
adieu
marguerite
i
am
going
into
the
country
again
are
you
sure
of
beaulieu
i
think
so
of
the
jailer
he
has
promised
of
the
horses
they
will
be
the
best
in
the
stables
of
the
duc
de
nevers
i
adore
you
henriette
and
marguerite
threw
her
arms
about
her
friend
neck
after
which
the
two
women
separated
promising
to
see
each
other
again
the
next
day
and
every
day
at
the
same
place
and
hour
these
were
the
two
charming
and
devoted
creatures
whom
coconnas
with
so
much
reason
called
his
chapter
lvii
the
judges
well
my
brave
friend
said
coconnas
to
la
mole
when
the
two
were
together
after
the
examination
at
which
for
the
first
time
the
subject
of
the
waxen
image
had
been
discussed
it
seems
to
me
that
everything
is
going
on
finely
and
that
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
judges
will
dismiss
us
and
this
diagnosis
is
entirely
different
from
that
of
a
dismissal
by
physicians
when
the
doctor
gives
up
the
patient
it
is
because
he
can
not
cure
him
but
when
the
judge
gives
up
the
accused
it
is
because
he
has
no
further
hope
of
having
him
beheaded
yes
said
la
mole
and
moreover
it
seems
to
me
from
the
politeness
and
gentleness
of
the
jailer
and
the
looseness
of
the
doors
that
i
recognize
our
kind
friends
but
i
do
not
recognize
monsieur
de
beaulieu
at
least
from
what
i
had
been
told
of
him
i
recognize
him
said
coconnas
only
it
will
cost
dearly
but
one
is
a
princess
the
other
a
queen
both
are
rich
and
they
will
never
have
so
good
an
opportunity
to
use
their
money
now
let
us
go
over
our
lesson
we
are
to
be
taken
to
the
chapel
and
left
there
in
charge
of
our
turnkey
we
shall
each
find
a
dagger
in
the
spot
indicated
i
am
to
make
a
hole
in
the
body
of
our
guide
yes
but
a
slight
one
in
the
arm
otherwise
you
will
rob
him
of
his
five
hundred
crowns
ah
no
not
in
the
arm
for
in
that
case
he
would
have
to
lose
it
and
it
would
be
easy
to
see
that
it
was
given
intentionally
no
it
must
be
in
his
right
side
gliding
skilfully
along
his
ribs
that
would
look
natural
but
in
reality
would
be
harmless
well
aim
for
that
and
then
then
you
will
barricade
the
front
door
with
benches
while
our
two
princesses
rush
from
behind
the
altar
where
they
are
to
be
hidden
and
henriette
opens
the
vestry
door
ah
faith
how
i
love
henriette
she
must
have
been
faithless
to
me
in
some
way
for
me
to
feel
as
i
do
and
then
said
la
mole
with
the
trembling
voice
which
falls
from
lips
like
music
then
we
shall
reach
the
forest
a
kiss
given
to
each
of
us
will
make
us
strong
and
happy
can
you
not
picture
us
annibal
bending
over
our
swift
horses
our
hearts
gently
oppressed
oh
what
a
good
thing
is
fear
fear
in
the
open
air
when
one
has
one
naked
sword
at
one
side
when
one
cries
to
the
courser
pricked
by
the
spur
and
which
at
each
shout
speeds
the
faster
yes
said
coconnas
but
fear
within
four
walls
what
do
you
say
to
that
la
mole
i
can
speak
of
it
for
i
have
felt
something
of
it
when
beaulieu
with
his
pale
face
entered
my
cell
for
the
first
time
behind
him
in
the
darkness
shone
halberds
and
i
heard
a
sinister
sound
of
iron
striking
against
iron
i
swear
to
you
i
immediately
thought
of
the
duc
and
i
expected
to
see
his
ugly
face
between
the
two
hateful
heads
of
the
halberdiers
i
was
mistaken
however
and
this
was
my
sole
consolation
but
that
was
not
all
night
came
and
i
dreamed
so
said
la
mole
who
had
been
following
his
happy
train
of
thought
without
paying
attention
to
his
friend
so
they
have
foreseen
everything
even
the
place
in
which
we
are
to
hide
we
shall
go
to
lorraine
dear
friend
in
reality
i
should
rather
have
had
it
navarre
for
there
i
should
have
been
with
her
but
navarre
is
too
far
nancey
would
be
better
besides
once
there
we
should
be
only
eighty
leagues
from
paris
have
you
any
feeling
of
regret
annibal
at
leaving
this
place
ah
no
the
idea
although
i
confess
i
am
leaving
everything
that
belongs
to
me
well
could
we
manage
to
take
the
worthy
jailer
with
us
instead
of
he
would
not
go
said
coconnas
he
would
lose
too
much
think
of
it
five
hundred
crowns
from
us
a
reward
from
the
government
promotion
perhaps
how
happy
will
be
that
fellow
life
when
i
shall
have
killed
him
but
what
is
the
matter
nothing
an
idea
came
to
me
it
is
not
a
funny
one
apparently
for
you
are
frightfully
pale
i
was
wondering
why
they
should
take
us
to
the
chapel
why
said
coconnas
to
receive
the
sacrament
this
is
the
time
for
it
i
think
but
said
la
mole
they
take
only
those
condemned
to
death
or
the
torture
to
the
chapel
oh
said
coconnas
becoming
somewhat
pale
in
turn
this
deserves
our
attention
let
us
question
the
good
man
whom
i
am
to
split
open
here
turnkey
did
monsieur
call
asked
the
jailer
who
had
been
keeping
watch
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
yes
come
here
well
it
has
been
arranged
that
we
are
to
escape
from
the
chapel
has
it
not
hush
said
the
turnkey
looking
round
him
in
terror
do
not
worry
no
one
can
hear
us
yes
monsieur
it
is
from
the
chapel
they
are
to
take
us
to
the
chapel
then
yes
that
is
the
custom
the
custom
yes
it
is
customary
to
allow
every
one
condemned
to
death
to
pass
the
night
in
the
chapel
coconnas
and
la
mole
shuddered
and
glanced
at
each
other
you
think
we
are
condemned
to
death
then
certainly
you
too
must
think
so
why
should
we
think
so
asked
la
mole
certainly
otherwise
you
would
not
have
arranged
everything
for
your
escape
do
you
know
there
is
reason
in
what
he
says
said
coconnas
to
la
mole
yes
and
what
i
know
besides
is
that
we
are
playing
a
close
game
apparently
but
do
you
think
i
am
risking
nothing
said
the
turnkey
if
in
a
moment
of
excitement
monsieur
should
make
a
mistake
well
by
heaven
i
wish
i
were
in
your
place
said
coconnas
slowly
and
had
to
deal
with
no
hand
but
this
with
no
sword
except
the
one
which
is
to
graze
you
condemned
to
death
murmured
la
mole
why
that
is
impossible
impossible
said
the
turnkey
naïvely
and
why
hush
said
coconnas
i
think
some
one
is
opening
the
lower
door
to
your
cells
gentlemen
to
your
cells
cried
the
jailer
hurriedly
when
do
you
think
the
trial
will
take
place
asked
la
mole
or
later
but
be
easy
those
who
must
be
informed
shall
be
then
let
us
embrace
each
other
and
bid
farewell
to
these
walls
the
two
friends
rushed
into
each
other
arms
and
then
returned
to
their
cells
la
mole
sighing
coconnas
singing
nothing
new
happened
until
seven
night
fell
dark
and
rainy
over
the
prison
of
vincennes
a
perfect
night
for
flight
the
evening
meal
was
brought
to
coconnas
who
ate
with
his
usual
appetite
thinking
of
the
pleasure
he
would
feel
in
being
soaked
in
the
rain
which
was
pattering
against
the
walls
and
already
preparing
himself
to
fall
asleep
to
the
dull
monotonous
murmur
of
the
wind
when
suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
wind
to
which
he
occasionally
listened
with
a
feeling
of
melancholy
never
before
experienced
by
him
until
he
came
to
prison
whistled
more
strangely
than
usual
under
the
doors
and
that
the
stove
roared
with
a
louder
noise
than
common
this
had
happened
every
time
one
of
the
cells
above
or
opposite
him
was
opened
it
was
by
this
noise
that
annibal
always
knew
the
jailer
was
coming
from
la
cell
but
this
time
it
was
in
vain
that
coconnas
remained
with
eye
and
ear
alert
the
moments
passed
no
one
came
this
is
strange
said
coconnas
la
mole
door
has
been
opened
and
not
mine
could
la
mole
have
called
can
he
be
ill
what
does
it
mean
with
a
prisoner
everything
is
a
cause
for
suspicion
and
anxiety
as
everything
is
a
cause
for
joy
and
hope
half
an
hour
passed
then
an
hour
then
an
hour
and
a
half
coconnas
was
beginning
to
grow
sleepy
from
anger
when
the
grating
of
the
lock
made
him
spring
to
his
feet
oh
said
he
has
the
time
come
for
us
to
leave
and
are
they
going
to
take
us
to
the
chapel
without
condemning
us
by
heaven
what
joy
it
would
be
to
escape
on
such
a
night
it
is
as
dark
as
an
oven
i
hope
the
horses
are
not
blind
he
was
about
to
ask
some
jocular
question
of
the
turnkey
when
he
saw
the
latter
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
and
roll
his
eyes
significantly
behind
the
jailer
coconnas
heard
sounds
and
perceived
shadows
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
he
distinguished
two
helmets
on
which
the
smoking
candle
threw
a
yellow
light
oh
said
he
in
a
low
voice
what
is
this
sinister
procession
what
is
going
to
happen
the
jailer
replied
by
a
sigh
which
greatly
resembled
a
groan
by
heaven
murmured
coconnas
what
a
wretched
existence
always
on
the
ragged
edge
never
on
firm
land
either
we
paddle
in
a
hundred
feet
of
water
or
we
hover
above
the
clouds
never
a
happy
medium
well
where
are
we
going
follow
the
halberdiers
monsieur
repeated
the
same
voice
he
had
to
obey
coconnas
left
his
room
and
perceived
the
dark
man
whose
voice
had
been
so
disagreeable
he
was
a
clerk
small
and
hunchbacked
who
no
doubt
had
put
on
the
gown
in
order
to
hide
his
bandy
legs
as
well
as
his
back
he
slowly
descended
the
winding
stairs
at
the
first
landing
the
guards
paused
that
is
a
good
deal
to
go
down
murmured
coconnas
but
not
enough
the
door
opened
the
prisoner
had
the
eye
of
a
lynx
and
the
scent
of
a
bloodhound
he
scented
the
judges
and
saw
in
the
shadow
the
silhouette
of
a
man
with
bare
arms
the
latter
sight
made
the
perspiration
mount
to
his
brow
nevertheless
he
assumed
his
most
smiling
manner
and
entered
the
room
with
his
head
tipped
to
one
side
and
his
hand
on
his
hip
after
the
most
approved
manner
of
the
times
a
curtain
was
raised
and
coconnas
perceived
the
judges
and
the
clerks
a
few
feet
away
la
mole
was
seated
on
a
bench
coconnas
was
led
to
the
front
of
the
tribunal
arrived
there
he
stopped
nodded
and
smiled
to
la
mole
and
then
waited
what
is
your
name
monsieur
inquired
the
president
marcus
annibal
de
coconnas
replied
the
gentleman
with
perfect
ease
count
de
montpantier
chenaux
and
other
places
but
they
are
known
i
presume
where
were
you
born
at
saint
colomban
near
suza
how
old
are
you
years
and
three
months
good
said
the
president
this
pleases
him
apparently
said
coconnas
now
said
the
president
after
a
moment
silence
which
gave
the
clerk
time
to
write
down
the
answers
of
the
accused
what
was
your
reason
for
leaving
the
service
of
monsieur
to
rejoin
my
friend
monsieur
de
la
mole
who
had
already
left
the
duke
three
days
before
what
were
you
doing
the
day
of
the
hunt
when
you
were
arrested
why
said
coconnas
i
was
hunting
the
king
was
also
present
at
that
hunt
and
was
there
seized
with
the
first
attack
of
the
malady
from
which
he
is
at
present
suffering
i
was
not
near
the
king
and
i
can
say
nothing
about
this
i
was
even
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
the
judges
looked
at
one
another
with
a
smile
of
incredulity
ah
you
were
ignorant
of
his
majesty
illness
were
you
said
the
president
yes
monsieur
and
i
am
sorry
to
hear
of
it
although
the
king
of
france
is
not
my
king
i
have
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
for
him
indeed
on
my
honor
it
is
different
so
far
as
his
brother
the
duc
is
concerned
the
latter
i
confess
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
duc
monsieur
this
concerns
his
majesty
well
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
am
his
very
humble
servant
said
coconnas
turning
about
in
an
adorably
impudent
fashion
if
as
you
pretend
monsieur
you
are
really
his
servant
will
you
tell
us
what
you
know
of
a
certain
waxen
figure
ah
good
we
have
come
back
to
the
figure
have
we
yes
monsieur
does
this
displease
you
on
the
contrary
i
prefer
it
go
ahead
why
was
this
statue
found
in
monsieur
de
la
mole
apartments
at
monsieur
de
la
mole
at
réné
you
mean
you
acknowledge
that
it
exists
then
do
you
why
if
you
will
show
it
to
me
here
it
is
is
this
the
one
you
know
it
is
clerk
said
the
president
write
down
that
the
accused
recognizes
the
image
as
the
one
seen
at
monsieur
de
la
mole
no
no
said
coconnas
do
not
let
us
misunderstand
each
other
as
the
one
seen
at
réné
at
réné
very
good
on
what
day
the
only
day
la
mole
and
myself
were
at
réné
you
admit
then
that
you
were
at
réné
with
monsieur
de
la
mole
why
did
i
ever
deny
it
clerk
write
down
that
the
accused
admits
having
gone
to
réné
to
work
conjurations
stop
there
monsieur
le
président
moderate
your
enthusiasm
i
beg
you
i
did
not
say
that
at
all
you
deny
having
been
at
réné
to
work
conjurations
i
deny
it
the
magic
took
place
by
accident
it
was
unpremeditated
but
it
took
place
i
can
not
deny
that
something
resembling
a
charm
did
take
place
clerk
write
down
that
the
accused
admits
that
he
obtained
at
réné
a
charm
against
the
life
of
the
king
what
against
the
king
life
that
is
an
infamous
lie
there
was
no
charm
obtained
against
the
life
of
the
king
you
see
gentlemen
said
la
mole
silence
said
the
president
then
turning
to
the
clerk
against
the
life
of
the
king
he
continued
have
you
that
why
no
no
cried
coconnas
besides
the
figure
is
not
that
of
a
man
but
of
a
woman
what
did
i
tell
you
gentlemen
said
la
mole
monsieur
de
la
mole
said
the
president
answer
when
you
are
questioned
but
do
not
interrupt
the
examination
of
others
so
you
say
that
it
is
a
woman
certainly
i
say
so
in
that
case
why
did
it
have
a
crown
and
a
cloak
by
heaven
said
coconnas
that
is
simple
enough
because
it
was
la
mole
rose
and
put
his
finger
on
his
lips
that
is
so
said
coconnas
what
was
i
going
to
say
that
could
possibly
concern
these
gentlemen
you
persist
in
stating
that
the
figure
is
that
of
a
woman
yes
certainly
i
persist
and
you
refuse
to
say
what
woman
a
woman
of
my
country
said
la
mole
whom
i
loved
and
by
whom
i
wished
to
be
loved
in
return
we
are
not
asking
you
monsieur
de
la
mole
said
the
president
keep
silent
therefore
or
you
shall
be
gagged
gagged
exclaimed
coconnas
what
do
you
mean
monsieur
of
the
black
robe
my
friend
gagged
a
gentleman
the
idea
bring
in
réné
said
the
laguesle
yes
bring
in
réné
said
coconnas
we
shall
see
who
is
right
here
we
two
or
you
three
réné
entered
pale
aged
and
almost
unrecognizable
to
the
two
friends
bowed
under
the
weight
of
the
crime
he
was
about
to
commit
much
more
than
because
of
those
he
had
already
committed
maître
réné
said
the
judge
do
you
recognize
the
two
accused
persons
here
present
yes
monsieur
replied
réné
in
a
voice
which
betrayed
his
emotion
from
having
seen
them
where
in
several
places
and
especially
at
my
house
how
many
times
did
they
go
to
your
house
once
only
as
réné
spoke
the
face
of
coconnas
expanded
la
mole
on
the
contrary
looked
as
though
he
had
a
presentiment
of
evil
for
what
purpose
were
they
at
your
house
réné
seemed
to
hesitate
a
moment
to
order
me
to
make
a
waxen
figure
said
he
pardon
me
maître
réné
said
coconnas
you
are
making
a
slight
mistake
silence
said
the
president
then
turning
to
réné
was
this
figure
to
be
that
of
a
man
or
a
woman
a
man
replied
réné
coconnas
sprang
up
as
if
he
had
received
an
electric
shock
a
man
he
exclaimed
a
man
repeated
réné
but
in
so
low
a
tone
that
the
president
scarcely
heard
him
why
did
this
figure
of
a
man
have
on
a
mantle
and
a
crown
because
it
represented
a
king
infamous
liar
cried
coconnas
infuriated
keep
still
coconnas
keep
still
interrupted
la
mole
let
the
man
speak
every
one
has
a
right
to
sell
his
own
soul
but
not
the
bodies
of
others
by
heaven
and
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
needle
in
the
heart
of
the
figure
with
the
letter
on
a
small
banner
the
needle
was
emblematical
of
the
sword
or
the
dagger
the
letter
stands
for
coconnas
sprang
forward
as
though
to
strangle
réné
but
four
guards
restrained
him
that
will
do
said
the
attorney
laguesle
the
court
is
sufficiently
informed
take
the
prisoners
to
the
but
exclaimed
coconnas
it
is
impossible
to
hear
one
self
accused
of
such
things
without
protesting
protest
monsieur
no
one
will
hinder
you
guards
did
you
hear
the
guards
seized
the
two
prisoners
and
led
them
out
la
mole
by
one
door
coconnas
by
another
then
the
attorney
signed
to
the
man
whom
coconnas
had
perceived
in
the
shadow
and
said
to
him
do
not
go
away
my
good
fellow
you
shall
have
work
this
evening
which
shall
i
begin
with
monsieur
asked
the
man
respectfully
holding
his
cap
in
his
hand
with
that
one
said
the
president
pointing
to
la
mole
who
could
still
be
seen
disappearing
in
the
distance
between
the
two
guards
then
approaching
réné
who
stood
trembling
expecting
to
be
led
back
to
the
cell
in
which
he
had
been
confined
you
have
spoken
well
monsieur
said
he
to
him
you
need
not
worry
both
the
king
and
the
queen
shall
know
that
it
is
to
you
they
are
indebted
for
the
truth
of
this
affair
but
instead
of
giving
him
strength
this
promise
seemed
to
terrify
réné
whose
only
answer
was
a
deep
sigh
chapter
lviii
the
torture
of
the
boot
it
was
only
when
he
had
been
led
away
to
his
new
cell
and
the
door
was
locked
on
him
that
coconnas
left
alone
and
no
longer
sustained
by
the
discussion
with
the
judges
and
his
anger
at
réné
fell
into
a
train
of
mournful
reflections
it
seems
to
me
thought
he
that
matters
are
turning
against
us
and
that
it
is
about
time
to
go
to
the
chapel
i
suspect
we
are
to
be
condemned
to
death
it
looks
so
i
especially
fear
being
condemned
to
death
by
sentences
pronounced
behind
closed
doors
in
a
fortified
castle
before
faces
as
ugly
as
those
about
me
they
really
wish
to
cut
off
our
heads
well
well
i
repeat
what
i
said
just
now
it
is
time
to
go
to
chapel
these
words
uttered
in
a
low
tone
were
followed
by
a
silence
which
in
turn
was
broken
by
a
cry
shrill
piercing
lugubrious
unlike
anything
human
it
seemed
to
penetrate
the
thick
walls
and
vibrate
against
the
iron
bars
in
spite
of
himself
coconnas
shivered
and
yet
he
was
so
brave
that
his
courage
was
like
that
of
wild
beasts
he
stood
still
doubting
that
the
cry
was
human
and
taking
it
for
the
sound
of
the
wind
in
the
trees
or
for
one
of
the
many
night
noises
which
seem
to
rise
or
descend
from
the
two
unknown
worlds
between
which
floats
our
globe
then
he
heard
it
again
shriller
more
prolonged
more
piercing
than
before
and
this
time
not
only
did
coconnas
distinguish
the
agony
of
the
human
tone
in
it
but
he
thought
it
sounded
like
la
mole
as
he
realized
this
the
piedmontese
forgot
that
he
was
confined
behind
two
doors
three
gates
and
a
wall
twelve
feet
thick
he
hurled
his
entire
weight
against
the
sides
of
the
cell
as
though
to
push
them
out
and
rush
to
the
aid
of
the
victim
crying
are
they
killing
some
one
here
but
he
unexpectedly
encountered
the
wall
and
the
shock
hurled
him
back
against
a
stone
bench
on
which
he
sank
down
then
there
was
silence
oh
they
have
killed
him
he
murmured
it
is
abominable
and
one
is
without
arms
here
and
can
not
defend
one
self
he
groped
about
ah
this
iron
chain
he
cried
i
will
take
it
and
woe
to
him
who
comes
near
me
coconnas
rose
seized
the
iron
chain
and
with
a
pull
shook
it
so
violently
that
it
was
clear
that
with
two
such
efforts
he
would
wrench
it
away
but
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
the
light
from
a
couple
of
torches
fell
into
the
cell
come
monsieur
said
the
same
voice
which
had
sounded
so
disagreeable
to
him
and
which
this
time
in
making
itself
heard
three
floors
below
did
not
seem
to
him
to
have
acquired
any
new
charm
come
monsieur
the
court
is
awaiting
you
good
said
coconnas
dropping
his
ring
i
am
to
hear
my
sentence
am
i
not
yes
monsieur
oh
i
breathe
again
let
us
go
said
he
he
followed
the
usher
who
preceded
him
with
measured
tread
holding
his
black
rod
in
spite
of
the
satisfaction
he
had
felt
at
first
as
he
walked
along
coconnas
glanced
anxiously
about
him
oh
he
murmured
i
do
not
perceive
my
good
jailer
i
confess
i
miss
him
they
entered
the
hall
the
judges
had
just
left
in
which
a
man
was
standing
alone
whom
coconnas
recognized
as
the
in
the
course
of
the
examination
the
latter
had
spoken
several
times
always
with
an
animosity
easy
to
understand
he
was
the
one
whom
catharine
both
by
letter
and
in
person
had
specially
charged
with
the
trial
at
the
farther
end
of
this
room
the
corners
of
which
were
lost
in
darkness
behind
a
partly
raised
curtain
coconnas
saw
such
dreadful
sights
that
he
felt
his
limbs
give
away
and
cried
out
oh
my
god
it
was
not
without
cause
that
the
cry
had
been
uttered
the
sight
was
indeed
terrible
the
portion
of
the
room
hidden
during
the
trial
by
the
curtain
which
was
now
drawn
back
looked
like
the
entrance
to
hell
a
wooden
horse
was
there
to
which
were
attached
ropes
pulleys
and
other
accessories
of
torture
further
on
glowed
a
brazier
which
threw
its
lurid
glare
on
the
surrounding
objects
and
which
added
to
the
terror
of
the
spectacle
against
one
of
the
pillars
which
supported
the
ceiling
stood
a
man
motionless
as
a
statue
holding
a
rope
in
his
hand
he
looked
as
though
made
of
the
stone
of
the
column
against
which
he
leaned
to
the
walls
above
the
stone
benches
between
iron
links
chains
were
suspended
and
blades
glittered
oh
murmured
coconnas
the
chamber
of
horrors
is
all
ready
apparently
waiting
only
for
the
patient
what
can
it
mean
on
your
knees
marc
annibal
coconnas
said
a
voice
which
caused
that
gentleman
to
raise
his
head
on
your
knees
to
hear
the
sentence
just
pronounced
on
you
this
was
an
invitation
against
which
the
whole
soul
of
annibal
instinctively
rebelled
but
as
he
was
about
to
refuse
two
men
placed
their
hands
on
his
shoulders
so
unexpectedly
and
so
suddenly
that
his
knees
bent
under
him
on
the
pavement
the
voice
continued
sentence
of
the
court
sitting
in
the
prison
of
vincennes
on
marc
annibal
de
coconnas
accused
and
convicted
of
high
treason
of
an
attempt
to
poison
of
sacrilege
and
magic
against
the
person
of
the
king
of
a
conspiracy
against
the
kingdom
and
of
having
by
his
pernicious
counsels
driven
a
prince
of
the
blood
to
rebellion
at
each
charge
coconnas
had
shaken
his
head
keeping
time
like
a
fractious
child
the
judge
continued
in
consequence
of
which
the
aforesaid
marc
annibal
de
coconnas
shall
be
taken
from
prison
to
the
place
saint
jean
en
grève
to
be
there
beheaded
his
property
shall
be
confiscated
his
woods
cut
down
to
the
height
of
six
feet
his
castles
destroyed
and
a
post
planted
there
with
a
copper
plate
bearing
an
inscription
of
his
crime
and
punishment
as
for
my
head
said
coconnas
i
know
you
will
cut
that
off
for
it
is
in
france
and
in
great
jeopardy
but
as
for
my
woods
and
castles
i
defy
all
the
saws
and
axes
of
this
most
christian
kingdom
to
harm
them
silence
said
the
judge
and
he
continued
furthermore
the
aforesaid
coconnas
what
interrupted
coconnas
is
something
more
to
be
done
to
me
after
my
head
is
cut
off
oh
that
seems
to
me
very
hard
no
monsieur
said
the
judge
and
he
resumed
furthermore
the
aforesaid
coconnas
before
the
execution
of
his
sentence
shall
undergo
the
severest
torture
consisting
of
ten
wedges
coconnas
sprang
up
flashing
a
burning
glance
at
the
judge
and
for
what
he
cried
finding
no
other
words
but
these
simple
ones
to
express
the
thousand
thoughts
that
surged
through
his
mind
in
reality
this
was
complete
ruin
to
coconnas
hopes
he
would
not
be
taken
to
the
chapel
until
after
the
torture
from
which
many
frequently
died
the
braver
and
stronger
the
victim
the
more
likely
he
was
to
die
for
it
was
considered
an
act
of
cowardice
to
confess
and
so
long
as
the
prisoner
refused
to
confess
the
torture
was
continued
and
not
only
continued
but
increased
the
judge
did
not
reply
to
coconnas
the
rest
of
the
sentence
answered
for
him
he
continued
in
order
to
compel
the
aforesaid
coconnas
to
confess
in
regard
to
his
accomplices
and
the
details
of
the
plan
and
conspiracy
by
heaven
cried
coconnas
this
is
what
i
call
infamous
more
than
infamous
cowardly
accustomed
to
the
anger
of
his
victims
which
suffering
always
changed
to
tears
the
impassible
judge
merely
made
a
sign
coconnas
was
seized
by
the
feet
and
the
shoulders
overpowered
laid
on
his
back
and
bound
to
the
rack
before
he
was
able
even
to
see
those
who
did
the
act
wretches
shouted
he
in
a
paroxysm
of
fury
straining
the
bed
and
the
cords
so
that
the
tormentors
themselves
drew
back
wretches
torture
me
twist
me
break
me
to
pieces
but
you
shall
know
nothing
i
swear
ah
you
think
do
you
that
it
is
with
pieces
of
wood
and
steel
that
a
gentleman
of
my
name
is
made
to
speak
go
ahead
i
defy
you
prepare
to
write
clerk
said
the
judge
yes
prepare
shouted
coconnas
and
if
you
write
everything
i
am
going
to
tell
you
you
infamous
hangmen
you
will
be
kept
busy
write
write
have
you
anything
you
wish
to
confess
asked
the
judge
in
his
calm
voice
nothing
not
a
word
go
to
the
devil
you
had
better
reflect
monsieur
come
executioner
adjust
the
boot
at
these
words
the
man
who
until
then
had
stood
motionless
the
ropes
in
his
hand
stepped
forward
from
the
pillar
and
slowly
approached
coconnas
who
turned
and
made
a
grimace
at
him
it
was
maître
caboche
the
executioner
of
the
provostship
of
paris
a
look
of
sad
surprise
showed
itself
on
the
face
of
coconnas
who
instead
of
crying
out
and
growing
agitated
lay
without
moving
unable
to
take
his
eyes
from
the
face
of
the
forgotten
friend
who
appeared
at
that
moment
without
moving
a
muscle
of
his
face
without
showing
that
he
had
ever
seen
coconnas
anywhere
except
on
the
rack
caboche
placed
two
planks
between
the
limbs
of
the
victim
two
others
outside
of
his
limbs
and
bound
them
securely
together
by
means
of
the
rope
he
held
in
his
hand
this
was
the
arrangement
called
the
boot
for
ordinary
torture
six
wedges
were
inserted
between
the
two
planks
which
on
being
forced
apart
crushed
the
flesh
for
severe
torture
ten
wedges
were
inserted
and
then
the
planks
not
only
broke
the
flesh
but
the
bones
the
preliminaries
over
maître
caboche
slipped
the
end
of
the
wedge
between
the
two
planks
then
mallet
in
hand
bent
on
one
knee
and
looked
at
the
judge
do
you
wish
to
speak
said
the
latter
no
resolutely
answered
coconnas
although
he
felt
the
perspiration
rise
to
his
brow
and
his
hair
begin
to
stand
on
end
proceed
then
said
the
judge
insert
the
first
wedge
caboche
raised
his
arm
with
its
heavy
mallet
and
struck
the
wedge
a
tremendous
blow
which
gave
forth
a
dull
sound
the
rack
shook
coconnas
did
not
utter
a
single
word
at
the
first
wedge
which
usually
caused
the
most
resolute
to
groan
moreover
the
only
expression
on
his
face
was
that
of
indescribable
astonishment
he
watched
caboche
in
amazement
who
with
arm
raised
half
turned
towards
the
judge
stood
ready
to
repeat
the
blow
what
was
your
idea
in
hiding
in
the
forest
asked
the
judge
to
sit
down
in
the
shade
replied
coconnas
proceed
said
the
judge
caboche
gave
a
second
blow
which
resounded
like
the
first
coconnas
did
not
move
a
muscle
he
continued
to
watch
the
executioner
with
the
same
expression
the
judge
frowned
he
is
a
hard
christian
he
murmured
has
the
wedge
entered
caboche
bent
down
to
look
and
in
doing
so
said
to
coconnas
cry
out
you
poor
fellow
then
rising
up
to
the
head
monsieur
said
he
second
wedge
said
the
judge
coldly
the
words
of
caboche
explained
all
to
coconnas
the
worthy
executioner
had
rendered
his
friend
the
greatest
service
in
his
power
he
was
sparing
him
not
only
pain
but
more
the
shame
of
confession
by
driving
in
wedges
of
leather
the
upper
part
of
which
was
covered
with
wood
instead
of
oak
wedges
in
this
way
he
was
leaving
him
all
his
strength
to
face
the
scaffold
ah
kind
kind
caboche
murmured
coconnas
fear
nothing
i
will
cry
out
since
you
ask
me
to
and
if
you
are
not
satisfied
it
will
be
because
you
are
hard
to
please
meanwhile
caboche
had
introduced
between
the
planks
the
end
of
a
wedge
larger
than
the
first
strike
cried
the
judge
at
this
word
caboche
struck
as
if
with
a
single
blow
he
would
demolish
the
entire
prison
of
vincennes
ah
ah
stop
stop
cried
coconnas
a
thousand
devils
you
are
breaking
my
bones
take
care
ah
said
the
judge
smiling
the
second
seems
to
take
effect
that
surprises
me
coconnas
panted
like
a
pair
of
bellows
what
were
you
doing
in
the
forest
asked
the
judge
by
heaven
i
have
already
told
you
i
was
enjoying
the
fresh
air
proceed
said
the
judge
confess
whispered
caboche
what
anything
you
wish
but
something
and
he
dealt
a
second
blow
no
less
light
than
the
former
coconnas
thought
he
would
strangle
himself
in
his
efforts
to
cry
out
oh
oh
said
he
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
monsieur
by
whose
order
i
was
in
the
forest
yes
i
was
there
by
order
of
monsieur
write
said
the
judge
if
i
committed
a
crime
in
setting
a
trap
for
the
king
of
navarre
continued
coconnas
i
was
only
an
instrument
monsieur
and
i
was
obeying
my
master
the
clerk
began
to
write
oh
you
denounced
me
murmured
the
victim
but
just
wait
and
he
related
the
visit
of
françois
to
the
king
of
navarre
the
interviews
between
de
mouy
and
monsieur
the
story
of
the
red
cloak
all
as
though
he
were
just
remembering
them
between
the
blows
of
the
hammer
at
length
he
had
given
such
precise
terrible
uncontestable
evidence
against
making
it
seem
as
though
it
was
extorted
from
him
only
by
the
pain
he
grimaced
roared
and
yelled
so
naturally
and
in
so
many
different
tones
of
voice
that
the
judge
himself
became
terrified
at
having
to
record
details
so
compromising
to
a
son
of
france
well
said
caboche
to
himself
here
is
a
gentleman
who
does
not
need
to
say
things
twice
and
who
gives
full
measure
of
work
to
the
clerk
great
god
what
if
instead
of
leather
the
wedges
had
been
of
wood
coconnas
was
excused
from
the
last
wedge
but
he
had
had
nine
others
which
were
enough
to
have
crushed
his
limbs
completely
the
judge
reminded
the
victim
of
the
mercy
allowed
him
on
account
of
his
confession
and
withdrew
the
prisoner
was
alone
with
caboche
well
asked
the
latter
how
are
you
ah
my
friend
my
kind
friend
my
dear
caboche
exclaimed
coconnas
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
be
grateful
all
my
life
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
the
deuce
but
you
are
right
monsieur
for
if
they
knew
what
i
have
done
it
would
be
i
who
would
have
to
take
your
place
on
the
rack
and
they
would
not
treat
me
as
i
have
treated
you
but
how
did
the
idea
come
to
you
well
said
caboche
wrapping
the
limbs
of
coconnas
in
bloody
bands
of
linen
i
knew
you
had
been
arrested
and
that
your
trial
was
going
on
i
knew
that
queen
catharine
was
anxious
for
your
death
i
guessed
that
they
would
put
you
to
the
torture
and
consequently
took
my
precautions
at
the
risk
of
what
might
have
happened
monsieur
said
caboche
you
are
the
only
gentleman
who
ever
gave
me
his
hand
and
we
all
have
memories
and
hearts
even
though
we
are
hangmen
and
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
you
will
see
how
well
i
will
do
my
work
said
coconnas
yes
what
work
caboche
looked
at
coconnas
in
amazement
what
work
have
you
forgotten
the
sentence
ah
yes
of
course
the
sentence
said
coconnas
i
had
forgotten
it
the
fact
is
that
coconnas
had
not
really
forgotten
it
but
he
had
not
been
thinking
of
it
what
he
was
thinking
of
was
the
chapel
the
knife
hidden
under
the
altar
cloth
of
henriette
and
the
queen
of
the
vestry
door
and
the
two
horses
waiting
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
he
was
thinking
of
liberty
of
the
ride
in
the
open
air
of
safety
beyond
the
boundaries
of
france
now
said
caboche
you
must
be
taken
skilfully
from
the
rack
to
the
litter
do
not
forget
that
for
every
one
even
the
guards
your
limbs
are
broken
and
that
at
every
jar
you
must
give
a
cry
ah
ah
cried
coconnas
as
the
two
assistants
advanced
come
come
courage
said
caboche
if
you
cry
out
already
what
will
you
do
in
a
little
while
my
dear
caboche
said
coconnas
do
not
have
me
touched
i
beg
by
your
estimable
acolytes
perhaps
their
hands
are
not
as
light
as
yours
place
the
litter
near
the
racks
said
caboche
the
attendants
obeyed
maître
caboche
raised
coconnas
in
his
arms
as
if
he
were
a
child
and
laid
him
in
the
litter
but
in
spite
of
every
care
coconnas
uttered
loud
shrieks
the
jailer
appeared
with
a
lantern
to
the
chapel
said
he
the
bearers
started
after
coconnas
had
given
caboche
a
second
grasp
of
the
hand
the
first
had
been
of
too
much
use
to
the
piedmontese
for
him
not
to
repeat
it
chapter
lix
the
chapel
in
profound
silence
the
mournful
procession
crossed
the
two
drawbridges
of
the
fortress
and
the
courtyard
which
leads
to
the
chapel
through
the
windows
of
which
a
pale
light
colored
the
white
faces
of
the
priests
coconnas
eagerly
breathed
the
night
air
although
it
was
heavy
with
rain
he
looked
at
the
profound
darkness
and
rejoiced
that
everything
seemed
propitious
for
the
flight
of
himself
and
his
companion
it
required
all
his
all
his
prudence
all
his
to
keep
from
springing
from
the
litter
when
on
entering
the
chapel
he
perceived
near
the
choir
three
feet
from
the
altar
a
figure
wrapped
in
a
great
white
cloak
it
was
la
mole
the
two
soldiers
who
accompanied
the
litter
stopped
outside
of
the
door
since
they
have
done
us
the
final
favor
of
once
more
leaving
us
together
said
coconnas
in
a
drawling
voice
take
me
to
my
friend
the
bearers
had
had
no
different
order
and
made
no
objection
to
assenting
to
coconnas
demand
la
mole
was
gloomy
and
pale
his
head
rested
against
the
marble
wall
his
black
hair
bathed
with
profuse
perspiration
gave
to
his
face
the
dull
pallor
of
ivory
and
seemed
still
to
stand
on
end
at
a
sign
from
the
turnkey
the
two
attendants
went
to
find
the
priest
for
whom
coconnas
had
asked
this
was
the
signal
agreed
on
coconnas
followed
them
with
anxious
eyes
but
he
was
not
the
only
one
whose
glance
was
riveted
on
them
scarcely
had
they
disappeared
when
two
women
rushed
from
behind
the
altar
and
hurried
to
the
choir
with
cries
of
joy
rousing
the
air
like
a
warm
and
restless
breeze
which
precedes
a
storm
marguerite
rushed
towards
la
mole
and
caught
him
in
her
arms
la
mole
uttered
a
piercing
shriek
like
one
of
the
cries
coconnas
had
heard
in
his
dungeon
and
which
had
so
terrified
him
my
god
what
is
the
matter
la
mole
cried
marguerite
springing
back
in
fright
la
mole
uttered
a
deep
moan
and
raised
his
hands
to
his
eyes
as
though
to
hide
marguerite
from
his
sight
the
queen
was
more
terrified
at
the
silence
and
this
gesture
than
she
had
been
at
the
shriek
oh
she
exclaimed
what
is
the
matter
you
are
covered
with
blood
coconnas
who
had
rushed
to
the
altar
for
the
dagger
and
who
was
already
holding
henriette
in
his
arms
now
came
back
rise
said
marguerite
rise
i
beg
you
you
see
the
time
has
come
a
hopelessly
sad
smile
passed
over
the
white
lips
of
la
mole
who
seemed
almost
unequal
to
the
effort
beloved
queen
said
the
young
man
you
counted
without
catharine
and
consequently
without
a
crime
i
underwent
the
torture
my
bones
are
broken
my
whole
body
is
nothing
but
a
wound
and
the
effort
i
make
now
to
press
my
lips
to
your
forehead
causes
me
pain
worse
than
death
pale
and
trembling
la
mole
touched
his
lips
to
the
queen
brow
the
rack
cried
coconnas
i
too
suffered
it
but
did
not
the
executioner
do
for
you
what
he
did
for
me
coconnas
related
everything
ah
said
la
mole
i
see
you
gave
him
your
hand
the
day
of
our
visit
i
forgot
that
all
men
are
brothers
and
was
proud
god
has
punished
me
for
it
la
mole
clasped
his
hands
coconnas
and
the
women
exchanged
a
glance
of
indescribable
terror
come
said
the
jailer
who
until
then
had
stood
at
the
door
to
keep
watch
and
had
now
returned
do
not
waste
time
dear
monsieur
de
coconnas
give
me
my
thrust
of
the
dagger
and
do
it
in
a
way
worthy
of
a
gentleman
for
they
are
coming
marguerite
knelt
down
before
la
mole
as
if
she
were
one
of
the
marble
figures
on
a
tomb
near
the
image
of
the
one
buried
in
it
come
my
friend
said
coconnas
i
am
strong
i
will
carry
you
i
will
put
you
on
your
horse
or
even
hold
you
in
front
of
me
if
you
can
not
sit
in
the
saddle
but
let
us
start
you
hear
what
this
good
man
says
it
is
a
question
of
life
and
death
la
mole
made
a
superhuman
struggle
a
final
effort
yes
said
he
it
is
a
question
of
life
or
death
and
he
strove
to
rise
annibal
took
him
by
the
arm
and
raised
him
during
the
process
la
mole
uttered
dull
moans
but
when
coconnas
let
go
of
him
to
attend
to
the
turnkey
and
when
he
was
supported
only
by
the
two
women
his
legs
gave
way
and
in
spite
of
the
effort
of
marguerite
who
was
wildly
sobbing
he
fell
back
in
a
heap
and
a
piercing
shriek
which
he
could
not
restrain
echoed
pitifully
throughout
the
vaults
of
the
chapel
which
vibrated
long
after
you
see
said
la
mole
painfully
you
see
my
queen
leave
me
give
me
one
last
kiss
and
go
i
did
not
confess
marguerite
and
our
secret
is
hidden
in
our
love
and
will
die
with
me
my
queen
my
queen
marguerite
herself
almost
lifeless
clasped
the
dear
head
in
her
arms
and
pressed
on
it
a
kiss
which
was
almost
holy
you
annibal
said
la
mole
who
have
been
spared
these
agonies
who
are
still
young
and
able
to
live
flee
flee
give
me
the
supreme
consolation
my
dear
friend
of
knowing
you
have
escaped
time
flies
said
the
jailer
make
haste
henriette
gently
strove
to
lead
annibal
to
the
door
marguerite
on
her
knees
before
la
mole
sobbing
and
with
dishevelled
hair
looked
like
a
magdalene
flee
annibal
said
la
mole
flee
do
not
give
our
enemies
the
joyful
spectacle
of
the
death
of
two
innocent
men
coconnas
quietly
disengaged
himself
from
henriette
who
was
leading
him
to
the
door
and
with
a
gesture
so
solemn
that
it
seemed
majestic
said
madame
first
give
the
five
hundred
crowns
we
promised
to
this
man
here
they
are
said
henriette
then
turning
to
la
mole
and
shaking
his
head
sadly
as
for
you
la
mole
you
do
me
wrong
to
think
for
an
instant
that
i
could
leave
you
have
i
not
sworn
to
live
and
die
with
you
but
you
are
suffering
so
my
poor
friend
that
i
forgive
you
and
seating
himself
resolutely
beside
his
friend
coconnas
leaned
forward
and
kissed
his
forehead
then
gently
as
gently
as
a
mother
would
do
to
her
child
he
drew
the
dear
head
towards
him
until
it
rested
on
his
breast
marguerite
was
numb
she
had
picked
up
the
dagger
which
coconnas
had
just
let
fall
oh
my
queen
said
la
mole
extending
his
arms
to
her
and
understanding
her
thought
my
beloved
queen
do
not
forget
that
i
die
in
order
to
destroy
the
slightest
suspicion
of
our
love
but
what
can
i
do
for
you
then
cried
marguerite
in
despair
if
i
can
not
die
with
you
you
can
make
death
sweet
to
me
replied
la
mole
you
can
come
to
me
with
smiling
lips
marguerite
advanced
and
clasped
her
hands
as
if
asking
him
to
speak
do
you
remember
that
evening
marguerite
when
in
exchange
for
the
life
i
then
offered
you
and
which
i
lay
down
for
you
you
made
me
a
sacred
promise
marguerite
gave
a
start
ah
you
do
remember
said
la
mole
for
you
shudder
yes
yes
i
remember
and
on
my
soul
hyacinthe
i
will
keep
that
promise
marguerite
raised
her
hand
towards
the
altar
as
if
calling
god
a
second
time
to
witness
her
oath
la
mole
face
lighted
up
as
if
the
vaulted
roof
of
the
chapel
had
opened
and
a
heavenly
ray
had
fallen
on
him
they
are
coming
said
the
jailer
marguerite
uttered
a
cry
and
rushed
to
la
mole
but
the
fear
of
increasing
his
agony
made
her
pause
trembling
before
him
henriette
pressed
her
lips
to
coconnas
brow
and
said
to
him
my
annibal
i
understand
and
i
am
proud
of
you
i
well
know
that
your
heroism
makes
you
die
and
for
that
heroism
i
love
you
before
god
i
will
always
love
you
more
than
all
else
and
what
marguerite
has
sworn
to
do
for
la
mole
although
i
know
not
what
it
is
i
swear
i
will
do
for
you
also
and
she
held
out
her
hand
to
marguerite
ah
thank
you
said
coconnas
that
is
the
way
to
speak
before
you
leave
me
my
queen
said
la
mole
one
last
favor
give
me
some
last
souvenir
that
i
may
kiss
it
as
i
mount
the
scaffold
ah
yes
yes
cried
marguerite
here
and
she
unfastened
from
her
neck
a
small
gold
reliquary
suspended
from
a
chain
of
the
same
metal
here
said
she
is
a
holy
relic
which
i
have
worn
from
childhood
my
mother
put
it
around
my
neck
when
i
was
very
little
and
she
still
loved
me
it
was
given
me
by
my
uncle
pope
clement
and
has
never
left
me
take
it
take
it
la
mole
took
it
and
kissed
it
passionately
they
are
at
the
door
said
the
jailer
flee
ladies
flee
the
two
women
rushed
behind
the
altar
and
disappeared
at
the
same
moment
the
priest
entered
chapter
lx
the
place
saint
jean
en
grève
it
was
seven
in
the
morning
and
a
noisy
crowd
was
waiting
in
the
squares
the
streets
and
on
the
quays
at
six
a
tumbril
the
same
in
which
after
their
duel
the
two
friends
had
been
conveyed
half
dead
to
the
louvre
had
started
from
vincennes
and
slowly
crossed
the
rue
saint
antoine
along
its
route
the
spectators
so
huddled
together
that
they
crushed
one
another
seemed
like
statues
with
fixed
eyes
and
open
mouths
this
day
there
was
to
be
a
heartrending
spectacle
offered
by
the
queen
mother
to
the
people
of
paris
on
some
straw
in
the
tumbril
we
have
mentioned
which
was
making
its
way
through
the
streets
were
two
young
men
bareheaded
and
entirely
clothed
in
black
leaning
against
each
other
coconnas
supported
on
his
knees
la
mole
whose
head
hung
over
the
sides
of
the
tumbril
and
whose
eyes
wandered
vaguely
here
and
there
the
crowd
eager
to
see
even
the
bottom
of
the
vehicle
crowded
forward
lifted
itself
up
stood
on
tiptoe
mounted
posts
clung
to
the
angles
of
the
walls
and
appeared
satisfied
only
when
it
had
succeeded
in
seeing
every
detail
of
the
two
bodies
which
were
going
from
the
torture
to
death
it
had
been
rumored
that
la
mole
was
dying
without
having
confessed
one
of
the
charges
imputed
to
him
while
on
the
contrary
coconnas
it
was
asserted
could
not
endure
the
torture
and
had
revealed
everything
so
there
were
cries
on
all
sides
see
the
one
it
was
he
who
confessed
it
was
he
who
told
everything
he
is
a
coward
and
is
the
cause
of
the
other
death
the
other
is
a
brave
fellow
and
confessed
nothing
the
two
young
men
heard
perfectly
the
one
the
praises
the
other
the
reproaches
which
accompanied
their
funeral
march
and
while
la
mole
pressed
the
hands
of
his
friend
a
sublime
expression
of
scorn
lighted
up
the
face
of
the
piedmontese
who
from
the
foul
tumbril
gazed
upon
the
stupid
mob
as
if
he
were
looking
down
from
a
triumphal
car
misfortune
had
done
its
heavenly
work
and
had
ennobled
the
face
of
coconnas
as
death
was
about
to
render
divine
his
soul
are
we
nearly
there
asked
la
mole
i
can
stand
no
more
my
friend
i
feel
as
if
i
were
going
to
faint
wait
wait
la
mole
we
are
passing
by
the
rue
tizon
and
the
rue
cloche
percée
look
look
oh
raise
me
raise
me
that
i
may
once
more
gaze
on
that
happy
abode
coconnas
raised
his
hand
and
touched
the
shoulder
of
the
executioner
who
sat
at
the
front
of
the
tumbril
driving
maître
said
he
do
us
the
kindness
to
stop
a
moment
opposite
the
rue
tizon
caboche
nodded
in
assent
and
drew
rein
at
the
place
indicated
aided
by
coconnas
la
mole
raised
himself
with
an
effort
and
with
eyes
blinded
by
tears
gazed
at
the
small
house
silent
and
mute
deserted
as
a
tomb
a
groan
burst
from
him
and
in
a
low
voice
he
murmured
adieu
adieu
youth
love
life
and
his
head
fell
forward
on
his
breast
courage
said
coconnas
we
may
perhaps
find
all
this
above
do
you
think
so
murmured
la
mole
i
think
so
because
the
priest
said
so
and
above
all
because
i
hope
so
but
do
not
faint
my
friend
or
these
staring
wretches
will
laugh
at
us
caboche
heard
the
last
words
and
whipping
his
horse
with
one
hand
he
extended
the
other
unseen
by
any
one
to
coconnas
it
contained
a
small
sponge
saturated
with
a
powerful
stimulant
and
la
mole
after
smelling
it
and
rubbing
his
forehead
with
it
felt
himself
revived
and
reanimated
ah
said
la
mole
i
am
better
and
he
kissed
the
reliquary
which
he
wore
around
his
neck
as
they
turned
a
corner
of
the
quay
and
reached
the
small
edifice
built
by
henry
ii
they
saw
the
scaffold
rising
bare
and
bloody
on
its
platform
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
dear
friend
said
la
mole
i
wish
i
might
be
the
first
to
die
coconnas
again
touched
the
hangman
shoulder
what
is
it
my
gentleman
said
the
latter
turning
around
my
good
fellow
said
coconnas
you
will
do
what
you
can
for
me
will
you
not
you
said
you
would
yes
and
i
repeat
it
my
friend
has
suffered
more
than
i
and
consequently
has
less
strength
well
well
he
says
that
it
would
cause
him
too
much
pain
to
see
me
die
first
besides
if
i
were
to
die
before
him
he
would
have
no
one
to
support
him
on
the
scaffold
very
well
said
caboche
wiping
away
a
tear
with
the
back
of
his
hand
be
easy
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
and
with
one
blow
eh
said
the
piedmontese
in
a
low
tone
with
one
blow
that
is
well
if
you
have
to
make
up
for
it
make
up
on
me
the
tumbril
stopped
they
had
arrived
coconnas
put
on
his
hat
a
murmur
like
that
of
the
waves
at
sea
reached
the
ears
of
la
mole
he
strove
to
rise
but
strength
failed
him
caboche
and
coconnas
supported
him
under
the
arms
the
place
was
paved
with
heads
the
steps
of
the
hôtel
de
ville
seemed
an
amphitheatre
peopled
with
spectators
each
window
was
filled
with
animated
faces
the
eyes
of
which
seemed
on
fire
when
they
saw
the
handsome
young
man
no
longer
able
to
support
himself
on
his
bruised
legs
make
a
last
effort
to
reach
the
scaffold
a
great
shout
rose
like
a
cry
of
universal
desolation
men
groaned
and
women
uttered
plaintive
shrieks
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
courtiers
said
the
men
and
he
should
not
have
to
die
at
saint
jean
en
grève
but
at
the
pré
aux
clercs
how
handsome
he
is
how
pale
said
the
women
he
is
the
one
who
would
not
confess
dearest
friend
said
la
mole
i
can
not
stand
carry
me
wait
said
coconnas
he
signed
to
the
executioner
who
stepped
aside
then
stooping
he
lifted
la
mole
in
his
arms
as
if
he
were
a
child
and
without
faltering
carried
his
burden
up
the
steps
of
the
scaffold
where
he
put
him
down
amid
the
frantic
shouting
and
applause
of
the
multitude
coconnas
raised
his
hat
and
bowed
then
he
threw
the
hat
on
the
scaffold
beside
him
look
round
said
la
mole
do
you
not
see
them
somewhere
coconnas
slowly
glanced
around
the
place
and
having
reached
a
certain
point
without
removing
his
eyes
from
it
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
friend
shoulder
look
said
he
look
at
the
window
of
that
small
tower
with
his
other
hand
he
pointed
out
to
la
mole
the
little
building
which
still
stands
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
vannerie
and
the
rue
mouton
a
reminder
of
past
ages
somewhat
back
from
the
window
two
women
dressed
in
black
were
leaning
against
each
other
ah
said
la
mole
i
feared
only
one
thing
and
that
was
to
die
without
seeing
her
again
i
have
seen
her
now
i
can
go
and
with
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
small
window
he
raised
the
reliquary
to
his
lips
and
covered
it
with
kisses
coconnas
saluted
the
two
women
with
as
much
grace
as
if
he
were
in
a
in
response
to
this
they
waved
their
handkerchiefs
bathed
in
tears
caboche
now
touched
coconnas
on
the
shoulder
and
looked
at
him
significantly
yes
yes
said
the
piedmontese
then
turning
to
la
mole
embrace
me
said
he
and
die
like
a
man
this
will
not
be
hard
for
you
my
friend
you
are
so
brave
ah
said
la
mole
there
will
be
no
merit
in
my
dying
bravely
suffering
as
i
do
the
priest
approached
and
held
the
crucifix
before
la
mole
who
smiled
and
pointed
to
the
reliquary
in
his
hand
never
mind
said
the
priest
ask
strength
from
him
who
suffered
what
you
are
about
to
suffer
la
mole
kissed
the
feet
of
the
christ
commend
me
to
the
prayers
of
the
nuns
of
the
avens
sainte
vierge
make
haste
la
mole
said
coconnas
you
cause
me
such
suffering
that
i
feel
myself
growing
weak
i
am
ready
said
la
mole
can
you
keep
your
head
steady
inquired
caboche
holding
his
sword
behind
la
mole
who
was
on
his
knees
i
hope
so
said
the
latter
then
all
will
go
well
but
said
la
mole
you
will
not
forget
what
i
asked
of
you
this
reliquary
will
open
the
doors
to
you
be
easy
now
try
to
keep
your
head
straight
la
mole
raised
his
head
and
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
little
tower
adieu
marguerite
said
he
bless
he
never
finished
with
one
blow
of
his
sword
as
swift
as
a
stroke
of
lightning
caboche
severed
the
head
which
rolled
to
the
feet
of
coconnas
the
body
fell
back
gently
as
if
going
to
rest
a
great
cry
rose
from
thousands
of
voices
and
among
them
it
seemed
to
coconnas
that
he
heard
a
shriek
more
piercing
than
all
the
rest
thank
you
my
good
friend
said
coconnas
and
a
third
time
he
extended
his
hand
to
the
hangman
my
son
said
the
priest
have
you
nothing
to
confess
to
god
faith
no
father
said
the
piedmontese
all
that
i
had
to
say
i
said
to
you
yesterday
then
turning
to
caboche
now
executioner
my
last
friend
one
more
favor
before
kneeling
down
he
turned
on
the
crowd
a
glance
so
calm
and
serene
that
a
murmur
of
admiration
rose
which
soothed
his
ear
and
flattered
his
pride
then
raising
the
head
of
his
friend
and
pressing
a
kiss
on
the
purple
lips
he
gave
a
last
look
toward
the
little
tower
and
kneeling
down
still
holding
the
head
in
his
hand
he
said
now
scarcely
had
he
uttered
the
word
before
caboche
had
cut
off
his
head
this
done
the
poor
hangman
began
to
tremble
it
was
time
it
was
over
said
he
poor
fellow
and
with
difficulty
he
drew
from
the
clinched
fingers
of
la
mole
the
reliquary
of
gold
then
he
threw
his
cloak
over
the
sad
remains
which
the
tumbril
was
to
convey
to
his
own
abode
the
spectacle
over
the
crowd
dispersed
chapter
lxi
the
headsman
tower
night
descended
over
the
city
which
still
trembled
at
the
remembrance
of
the
execution
the
details
of
which
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
saddening
the
happy
supper
hour
in
every
home
in
contrast
to
the
city
which
was
silent
and
mournful
the
louvre
was
noisy
joyous
and
illuminated
there
was
a
grand
fête
at
the
palace
a
fête
ordered
by
charles
a
fête
he
had
planned
for
that
evening
at
the
very
time
that
he
had
ordered
the
execution
for
the
morning
the
previous
evening
the
queen
of
navarre
had
received
word
to
be
present
and
in
the
hope
that
la
mole
and
coconnas
would
have
escaped
during
the
night
since
every
measure
had
been
taken
for
their
safety
she
had
promised
her
brother
to
comply
with
his
wishes
but
when
she
had
lost
all
hope
after
the
scene
in
the
chapel
after
out
of
a
last
feeling
of
piety
for
that
love
the
greatest
and
the
deepest
she
had
ever
known
she
had
been
present
at
the
execution
she
resolved
that
neither
prayers
nor
threats
should
force
her
to
attend
a
joyous
festival
at
the
louvre
the
same
day
on
which
she
had
witnessed
so
terrible
a
scene
at
the
grève
that
day
king
charles
had
given
another
proof
of
the
will
power
which
no
one
perhaps
carried
as
far
as
he
in
bed
for
a
fortnight
weak
as
a
dying
man
pale
as
a
corpse
yet
he
rose
about
five
and
donned
his
most
beautiful
clothes
although
during
his
toilet
he
fainted
three
times
at
eight
he
asked
what
had
become
of
his
sister
and
inquired
if
any
one
had
seen
her
and
what
she
was
doing
no
one
could
tell
him
for
the
queen
had
gone
to
her
apartments
about
eleven
and
had
absolutely
refused
admittance
to
every
one
but
there
was
no
refusal
for
charles
leaning
on
the
arm
of
monsieur
de
nancey
he
went
to
the
queen
rooms
and
entered
unannounced
by
the
secret
corridor
although
he
had
expected
a
melancholy
sight
and
had
prepared
himself
for
it
in
advance
that
which
he
saw
was
even
more
distressing
than
he
had
anticipated
marguerite
half
dead
was
lying
on
a
divan
her
head
buried
in
the
cushions
neither
weeping
nor
praying
but
moaning
like
one
in
great
agony
and
this
she
had
been
doing
ever
since
her
return
from
the
grève
at
the
other
end
of
the
chamber
henriette
de
nevers
that
daring
woman
lay
stretched
on
the
carpet
unconscious
on
coming
back
from
the
grève
her
strength
like
marguerite
had
given
out
and
poor
gillonne
was
going
from
one
to
the
other
not
daring
to
offer
a
word
of
consolation
in
the
crises
which
follow
great
catastrophes
one
hugs
one
grief
like
a
treasure
and
any
one
who
attempts
to
divert
us
ever
so
slightly
is
looked
on
as
an
enemy
charles
ix
closed
the
door
and
leaving
nancey
in
the
corridor
entered
pale
and
trembling
neither
of
the
women
had
seen
him
gillonne
alone
who
was
trying
to
revive
henriette
rose
on
one
knee
and
looked
in
a
startled
way
at
the
king
the
latter
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
whereupon
the
girl
rose
courtesied
and
withdrew
charles
then
approached
marguerite
looked
at
her
a
moment
in
silence
and
in
a
tone
of
which
his
harsh
voice
was
supposed
to
be
incapable
said
margot
my
sister
the
young
woman
started
and
sat
up
your
majesty
said
she
come
sister
courage
marguerite
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
yes
said
charles
but
listen
to
me
the
queen
of
navarre
made
a
sign
of
assent
you
promised
me
to
come
to
the
ball
said
charles
i
exclaimed
marguerite
yes
and
after
your
promise
you
are
expected
so
that
if
you
do
not
come
every
one
will
wonder
why
excuse
me
brother
said
marguerite
you
see
that
i
am
suffering
greatly
exert
yourself
for
an
instant
marguerite
seemed
to
try
to
summon
her
courage
then
suddenly
she
gave
way
and
fell
back
among
the
cushions
no
no
i
can
not
go
said
she
charles
took
her
hand
and
seating
himself
on
the
divan
said
you
have
just
lost
a
friend
i
know
margot
but
look
at
me
have
i
not
lost
all
my
friends
even
my
mother
you
can
always
weep
when
you
wish
to
but
i
at
the
moment
of
my
greatest
sorrows
am
always
forced
to
smile
you
suffer
but
look
at
me
i
am
dying
come
margot
courage
i
ask
it
of
you
sister
in
the
name
of
our
honor
we
bear
like
a
cross
of
agony
the
reputation
of
our
house
let
us
bear
it
sister
as
the
saviour
bore
his
cross
to
calvary
and
if
on
the
way
we
stagger
as
he
did
let
us
like
him
rise
brave
and
resigned
oh
my
god
my
god
cried
marguerite
yes
said
charles
answering
her
thought
the
sacrifice
is
severe
sister
but
each
one
has
his
own
burden
some
of
honor
others
of
life
do
you
suppose
that
with
my
years
and
the
most
beautiful
throne
in
the
world
i
do
not
regret
dying
look
at
me
my
eyes
my
complexion
my
lips
are
those
of
a
dying
man
it
is
true
but
my
smile
does
not
my
smile
imply
that
i
still
hope
and
in
a
week
a
month
at
the
most
you
will
be
weeping
for
me
sister
as
you
now
weep
for
him
who
died
brother
exclaimed
marguerite
throwing
her
arms
about
charles
neck
so
dress
yourself
dear
marguerite
said
the
king
hide
your
pallor
and
come
to
the
ball
i
have
given
orders
for
new
jewels
to
be
brought
to
you
and
ornaments
worthy
of
your
beauty
oh
what
are
diamonds
and
dresses
to
me
now
said
marguerite
life
is
long
marguerite
said
charles
smiling
at
least
for
you
the
pages
withdrew
gillonne
alone
remained
prepare
everything
that
is
necessary
for
me
gillonne
said
marguerite
sister
remember
one
thing
sometimes
it
is
by
stifling
or
rather
by
dissimulating
our
suffering
that
we
show
most
honor
to
the
dead
well
sire
said
marguerite
shuddering
i
will
go
to
the
ball
a
tear
which
soon
dried
on
his
parched
eyelid
moistened
charles
eye
he
leaned
over
his
sister
kissed
her
forehead
paused
an
instant
before
henriette
who
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
him
and
murmured
poor
woman
then
he
went
out
silently
soon
after
several
pages
entered
bringing
boxes
and
marguerite
made
a
sign
for
them
to
set
everything
down
gillonne
looked
at
her
mistress
in
astonishment
yes
said
marguerite
in
a
tone
the
bitterness
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
describe
yes
i
will
dress
and
go
to
the
ball
i
am
expected
make
haste
the
day
will
then
be
complete
a
fête
on
the
grève
in
the
morning
a
fête
in
the
louvre
in
the
evening
and
the
duchess
said
gillonne
she
is
quite
happy
she
may
remain
here
she
can
weep
she
can
suffer
at
her
ease
she
is
not
the
daughter
of
a
king
the
wife
of
a
king
the
sister
of
a
king
she
is
not
a
queen
help
me
to
dress
gillonne
the
young
girl
obeyed
the
jewels
were
magnificent
the
dress
gorgeous
marguerite
had
never
been
so
beautiful
she
looked
at
herself
in
a
mirror
my
brother
is
right
said
she
a
human
being
is
indeed
a
miserable
creature
at
that
moment
gillonne
returned
madame
said
she
a
man
is
asking
for
you
for
me
yes
who
is
he
i
do
not
know
but
he
is
terrible
to
look
at
the
very
sight
of
him
makes
me
shudder
go
and
ask
him
his
name
said
marguerite
turning
pale
gillonne
withdrew
and
returned
in
a
few
moments
he
will
not
give
his
name
madame
but
he
begged
me
to
give
you
this
gillonne
handed
to
marguerite
the
reliquary
she
had
given
to
la
mole
the
previous
evening
oh
bring
him
in
bring
him
in
said
the
queen
quickly
growing
paler
and
more
numb
than
before
a
heavy
step
shook
the
floor
the
echo
indignant
no
doubt
at
having
to
repeat
such
a
sound
moaned
along
the
wainscoting
a
man
stood
on
the
threshold
you
are
said
the
queen
he
whom
you
met
one
day
near
montfaucon
madame
and
who
in
his
tumbril
brought
back
two
wounded
gentlemen
to
the
louvre
yes
yes
i
know
you
you
are
maître
caboche
executioner
of
the
provostship
of
paris
madame
these
were
the
only
words
henriette
had
heard
for
an
hour
she
raised
her
pale
face
from
her
hands
and
looked
at
the
man
with
her
sapphire
eyes
from
which
a
double
flame
seemed
to
dart
and
you
come
said
marguerite
trembling
to
remind
you
of
your
promise
to
the
younger
of
the
two
gentlemen
who
charged
me
to
give
you
this
reliquary
you
remember
the
promise
madame
yes
yes
exclaimed
the
queen
and
never
has
a
noble
soul
had
more
satisfaction
than
his
shall
have
but
where
is
at
my
house
with
the
body
at
your
house
why
did
you
not
bring
it
i
might
have
been
stopped
at
the
gate
of
the
louvre
and
compelled
to
raise
my
cloak
what
would
they
have
said
if
they
had
seen
a
head
under
it
that
is
right
keep
it
i
will
come
for
it
madame
said
caboche
may
perhaps
be
too
late
how
so
because
the
queen
mother
wanted
the
heads
of
the
first
victims
executed
by
me
to
be
kept
for
her
magical
experiments
oh
what
profanation
the
heads
of
our
henriette
cried
marguerite
turning
to
her
friend
who
had
risen
as
if
a
spring
had
placed
her
on
her
feet
henriette
my
angel
do
you
hear
what
this
man
says
yes
what
must
we
do
go
with
him
then
uttering
a
cry
of
pain
by
which
great
sufferers
return
to
life
ah
i
was
so
happy
said
henriette
i
was
almost
dead
meanwhile
marguerite
had
thrown
a
velvet
cloak
over
her
bare
shoulders
come
said
she
we
will
go
and
see
them
once
more
telling
gillonne
to
have
all
the
doors
closed
the
queen
gave
orders
for
a
litter
to
be
brought
to
the
private
entrance
and
taking
henriette
by
the
arm
she
descended
by
the
secret
corridor
signing
to
caboche
to
follow
at
the
lower
door
was
the
litter
at
the
gate
caboche
attendant
waited
with
a
lantern
marguerite
porters
were
trusty
men
deaf
and
dumb
more
to
be
depended
on
than
if
they
had
been
beasts
of
burden
they
walked
for
about
ten
minutes
preceded
by
caboche
and
his
servant
carrying
the
lantern
then
they
stopped
the
hangman
opened
the
door
while
his
man
went
ahead
marguerite
stepped
from
the
litter
and
helped
out
the
duchesse
de
nevers
in
the
deep
grief
which
bound
them
together
it
was
the
nervous
organism
which
was
the
stronger
the
headsman
tower
rose
before
them
like
a
dark
vague
giant
giving
out
a
lurid
gleam
from
two
narrow
upper
windows
the
attendant
reappeared
at
the
door
you
can
enter
ladies
said
caboche
every
one
is
asleep
in
the
tower
at
the
same
moment
the
light
from
above
was
extinguished
the
two
women
holding
to
each
other
passed
through
the
small
gothic
door
and
reached
a
dark
hall
with
damp
and
uneven
pavement
at
the
end
of
a
winding
corridor
they
perceived
a
light
and
guided
by
the
gruesome
master
of
the
place
they
set
out
towards
it
the
door
closed
behind
them
caboche
a
wax
torch
in
hand
admitted
them
into
a
lower
room
filled
with
smoke
in
the
centre
was
a
table
containing
the
remains
of
a
supper
for
three
these
three
were
probably
the
hangman
his
wife
and
his
chief
assistant
in
a
conspicuous
place
on
the
wall
a
parchment
was
nailed
sealed
with
the
seal
of
the
king
it
was
the
hangman
license
in
a
corner
was
a
sword
this
was
the
flaming
sword
of
justice
here
and
there
were
various
rough
drawings
representing
martyrs
undergoing
the
torture
at
the
door
caboche
made
a
low
bow
your
majesty
will
excuse
me
said
he
if
i
ventured
to
enter
the
louvre
and
bring
you
here
but
it
was
the
last
wish
of
the
gentleman
so
that
i
felt
i
you
did
well
maître
said
marguerite
and
here
is
a
reward
for
you
caboche
looked
sadly
at
the
large
purse
which
marguerite
laid
on
the
table
gold
said
he
always
gold
alas
madame
if
i
only
could
buy
back
for
gold
the
blood
i
was
forced
to
spill
maître
said
marguerite
looking
around
with
a
sad
hesitation
maître
do
we
have
to
go
to
some
other
room
i
do
not
see
no
madame
they
are
here
but
it
is
a
sad
sight
and
one
which
i
could
have
spared
you
by
wrapping
up
in
my
cloak
that
for
which
you
have
come
marguerite
and
henriette
looked
at
each
other
no
said
the
queen
who
had
read
in
her
friend
eye
the
same
thought
as
in
her
own
no
show
us
the
way
and
we
will
follow
caboche
took
the
torch
and
opened
an
oaken
door
at
the
top
of
a
short
stairway
which
led
to
an
underground
chamber
at
that
instant
a
current
of
air
blew
some
sparks
from
the
torch
and
brought
to
the
princesses
an
odor
of
dampness
and
blood
henriette
white
as
an
alabaster
statue
leaned
on
the
arm
of
her
less
agitated
friend
but
at
the
first
step
she
swayed
i
can
never
do
it
said
she
when
one
loves
truly
henriette
replied
the
queen
one
loves
beyond
death
it
was
a
sight
both
horrible
and
touching
presented
by
the
two
women
glowing
with
youth
beauty
and
jewels
as
they
bent
their
heads
beneath
the
foul
chalky
ceiling
the
weaker
leaning
on
the
stronger
the
stronger
clinging
to
the
arm
of
the
hangman
they
reached
the
final
step
on
the
floor
of
the
cellar
lay
two
human
forms
covered
with
a
wide
cloth
of
black
serge
caboche
raised
a
corner
of
it
and
lowering
the
torch
see
madame
said
he
in
their
black
clothes
lay
the
two
young
men
side
by
side
in
the
strange
symmetry
of
death
their
heads
had
been
placed
close
to
their
bodies
from
which
they
seemed
to
be
separated
only
by
a
bright
red
circle
about
the
neck
death
had
not
disunited
their
hands
for
either
from
chance
or
the
kind
care
of
the
hangman
the
right
hand
of
la
mole
rested
in
coconnas
left
hand
there
was
a
look
of
love
under
the
lids
of
la
mole
and
a
smile
of
scorn
under
those
of
coconnas
marguerite
knelt
down
by
the
side
of
her
lover
and
with
hands
that
sparkled
with
gems
gently
raised
the
head
she
had
so
greatly
loved
the
duchesse
de
nevers
leaned
against
the
wall
unable
to
remove
her
eyes
from
that
pale
face
on
which
so
often
she
had
gazed
for
pleasure
and
for
love
la
mole
dear
la
mole
murmured
marguerite
annibal
annibal
cried
the
duchess
so
beautiful
so
proud
so
brave
never
again
will
you
answer
me
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
this
woman
so
scornful
so
intrepid
so
insolent
in
happiness
this
woman
who
carried
scepticism
as
far
as
absolute
doubt
passion
to
the
point
of
cruelty
this
woman
had
never
thought
of
death
marguerite
was
the
first
to
move
she
put
into
a
bag
embroidered
with
pearls
and
perfumed
with
finest
essences
the
head
of
la
mole
more
beautiful
than
ever
as
it
rested
against
the
velvet
and
the
gold
and
the
beauty
of
which
was
to
be
preserved
by
a
special
preparation
used
at
that
time
in
the
embalming
of
royal
personages
henriette
then
drew
near
and
wrapped
the
head
of
coconnas
in
a
fold
of
her
cloak
and
both
women
bending
beneath
their
grief
more
than
beneath
their
burdens
ascended
the
stairs
with
a
last
look
at
the
remains
which
they
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
hangman
in
that
sombre
abode
of
ordinary
criminals
do
not
fear
madame
said
caboche
who
understood
their
look
the
gentlemen
i
promise
you
shall
be
buried
in
holy
ground
and
you
will
have
masses
said
for
them
with
this
said
henriette
taking
from
her
neck
a
magnificent
necklace
of
rubies
and
handing
it
to
the
hangman
they
returned
to
the
louvre
by
the
same
road
by
which
they
had
gone
at
the
gate
the
queen
gave
her
name
at
the
foot
of
her
private
stairway
she
descended
and
returning
to
her
rooms
laid
her
sad
burden
in
the
closet
adjoining
her
destined
from
that
moment
to
become
an
oratory
then
leaving
henriette
in
her
room
paler
and
more
beautiful
than
ever
she
entered
the
great
ballroom
the
same
room
in
which
two
years
and
a
half
ago
the
first
chapter
of
our
history
opened
all
eyes
were
turned
on
her
but
she
bore
the
general
gaze
with
a
proud
and
almost
joyous
air
she
had
religiously
carried
out
the
last
wish
of
her
friend
seeing
her
charles
pushed
tremblingly
through
the
gilded
crowd
around
her
sister
said
he
aloud
i
thank
you
then
in
a
low
tone
take
care
said
he
you
have
a
spot
of
blood
on
your
arm
ah
what
difference
does
that
make
sire
said
marguerite
since
i
have
a
smile
on
my
lips
chapter
lxii
the
sweat
of
blood
a
few
days
after
the
terrible
scene
we
have
just
described
that
is
on
the
of
may
while
the
court
was
at
vincennes
suddenly
a
great
commotion
was
heard
in
the
chamber
of
the
king
the
latter
had
been
taken
ill
in
the
midst
of
the
ball
he
had
given
the
day
of
the
execution
of
the
two
young
men
and
had
been
ordered
by
his
physicians
into
the
pure
air
of
the
country
it
was
eight
in
the
morning
a
small
group
of
courtiers
were
talking
excitedly
in
the
antechamber
when
suddenly
a
cry
was
heard
and
charles
nurse
appeared
at
the
door
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
calling
frantically
help
help
is
his
majesty
worse
asked
the
captain
de
nancey
whom
as
we
know
the
king
had
relieved
from
all
duty
to
queen
catharine
in
order
to
attach
him
to
himself
oh
blood
blood
cried
the
nurse
the
doctors
call
the
doctors
mozille
and
ambroise
paré
in
turn
attended
the
august
patient
and
the
latter
seeing
the
king
fall
asleep
had
taken
advantage
of
the
fact
to
withdraw
for
a
few
moments
meanwhile
a
great
perspiration
had
broken
out
all
over
the
king
and
as
charles
suffered
from
a
relaxation
of
the
capillary
vessels
which
caused
a
hæmorrhage
of
the
skin
the
bloody
sweat
had
alarmed
the
nurse
unaccustomed
to
this
strange
phenomenon
who
being
a
protestant
kept
repeating
that
it
was
a
judgment
for
the
blood
of
the
huguenots
shed
in
the
massacre
of
saint
bartholomew
the
courtiers
went
in
all
directions
in
search
of
the
doctor
who
could
not
be
far
away
and
whom
they
could
not
fail
to
meet
the
antechamber
therefore
became
deserted
every
one
being
anxious
to
show
his
zeal
in
bringing
the
physician
just
then
a
door
opened
and
catharine
appeared
she
passed
hurriedly
through
the
antechamber
and
hastily
entered
the
apartment
of
her
son
charles
was
stretched
on
his
bed
his
eyes
closed
his
breast
heaving
from
his
body
oozed
a
crimson
sweat
his
hand
hung
over
the
bed
and
from
the
end
of
each
finger
dropped
a
ruby
liquid
it
was
a
horrible
sight
at
the
sound
of
his
mother
steps
as
if
he
knew
she
was
there
charles
sat
up
pardon
madame
said
he
looking
at
her
but
i
desire
to
die
in
peace
to
die
my
son
said
catharine
this
is
only
a
passing
attack
of
your
wretched
trouble
would
you
have
us
despair
in
this
way
i
tell
you
madame
i
feel
that
my
soul
is
about
to
pass
away
i
tell
you
madame
that
death
is
near
me
by
heaven
i
feel
what
i
feel
and
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
sire
said
the
queen
your
imagination
is
your
most
serious
trouble
since
the
punishment
of
those
two
sorcerers
those
assassins
la
mole
and
coconnas
your
physical
suffering
should
have
diminished
the
mental
trouble
alone
continues
and
if
i
could
talk
with
you
for
just
ten
minutes
i
could
prove
to
you
nurse
said
charles
watch
at
the
door
that
no
one
may
enter
queen
catharine
de
médicis
wishes
to
speak
with
her
son
charles
ix
the
nurse
withdrew
well
continued
charles
this
interview
will
have
to
take
place
some
day
or
other
and
better
than
besides
may
be
too
late
but
a
third
person
must
be
present
why
because
i
tell
you
i
am
dying
repeated
charles
with
frightful
seriousness
because
at
any
moment
death
may
enter
this
chamber
as
you
have
done
pale
silent
and
unannounced
it
is
therefore
time
last
night
i
settled
my
personal
affairs
this
morning
i
will
arrange
those
of
the
kingdom
what
person
do
you
desire
to
see
asked
catharine
my
brother
madame
have
him
summoned
sire
said
the
queen
i
see
with
pleasure
that
the
prejudices
dictated
by
hatred
rather
than
pain
are
leaving
your
mind
as
they
soon
will
fade
from
your
heart
nurse
cried
catharine
nurse
the
woman
who
was
keeping
watch
outside
opened
the
door
nurse
said
catharine
by
order
of
my
son
when
monsieur
de
nancey
returns
say
to
him
to
summon
the
duc
charles
made
a
sign
which
detained
the
woman
i
said
my
brother
madame
said
charles
catharine
eyes
dilated
like
those
of
a
tigress
about
to
show
her
anger
but
charles
raised
his
hand
imperatively
i
wish
to
speak
to
my
brother
henry
said
he
henry
alone
is
my
brother
not
he
who
is
king
yonder
but
he
who
is
a
prisoner
here
henry
shall
know
my
last
wishes
and
do
you
think
exclaimed
the
florentine
with
unusual
boldness
in
the
face
of
the
dread
will
of
her
son
her
hatred
for
the
béarnais
being
strong
enough
to
make
her
forget
her
customary
dissimulation
do
you
think
that
if
as
you
say
you
are
near
the
tomb
i
will
yield
to
any
one
especially
a
stranger
my
right
to
be
present
at
your
last
hour
my
right
as
queen
and
mother
madame
said
charles
i
am
still
king
and
i
still
command
i
tell
you
that
i
desire
to
speak
to
my
brother
henry
and
yet
you
do
not
summon
my
captain
of
the
guard
a
thousand
devils
i
warn
you
madame
i
still
have
strength
enough
to
go
for
him
myself
the
king
made
a
movement
as
if
to
rise
from
the
bed
which
brought
to
light
his
body
bloody
like
christ
after
the
flogging
sire
cried
catharine
holding
him
back
you
wrong
us
all
you
forget
the
insults
given
to
our
family
you
repudiate
our
blood
a
son
of
france
alone
should
kneel
before
the
of
a
king
of
france
as
to
me
my
place
is
marked
out
it
is
here
by
the
laws
of
nature
as
well
as
the
laws
of
royalty
therefore
i
shall
remain
and
by
what
right
do
you
remain
madame
demanded
charles
ix
because
i
am
your
mother
you
are
no
more
my
mother
madame
than
is
the
duc
my
brother
you
are
mad
monsieur
said
catharine
since
when
is
she
who
gives
birth
to
a
child
no
longer
his
mother
from
the
moment
madame
when
the
unnatural
mother
takes
away
that
which
she
gives
replied
charles
wiping
away
a
bloody
sweat
from
his
lips
what
do
you
mean
charles
i
do
not
understand
you
murmured
catharine
gazing
at
her
son
her
eyes
dilated
with
astonishment
but
you
will
madame
charles
searched
under
his
pillow
and
drew
out
a
small
silver
key
take
this
madame
and
open
my
it
contains
certain
papers
which
will
speak
for
me
charles
pointed
to
a
magnificent
carved
box
closed
with
a
silver
lock
like
the
key
which
occupied
the
most
conspicuous
place
in
the
room
catharine
dominated
by
the
look
and
manner
of
charles
obeyed
advanced
slowly
to
the
box
and
opened
it
but
no
sooner
had
she
looked
into
it
than
she
suddenly
sprang
back
as
if
she
had
seen
some
sleeping
reptile
inside
it
well
said
charles
who
had
not
taken
his
eyes
from
his
mother
what
is
there
in
the
box
to
startle
you
madame
nothing
said
catharine
then
put
in
your
hand
madame
and
take
out
a
book
that
is
there
there
is
one
is
there
not
added
charles
with
a
pale
smile
more
terrible
in
him
than
a
threat
in
another
yes
faltered
catharine
a
book
on
hunting
yes
take
it
out
and
bring
it
to
me
in
spite
of
her
assurance
catharine
turned
pale
and
trembled
in
every
limb
as
she
extended
her
hand
towards
the
box
fatality
she
murmured
raising
the
book
very
good
said
charles
now
listen
this
book
on
hunting
i
loved
the
chase
madly
above
everything
else
i
read
this
book
too
eagerly
do
you
understand
madame
catharine
gave
a
dull
moan
it
was
a
weakness
continued
charles
burn
it
madame
the
weakness
of
kings
and
queens
must
not
be
known
catharine
stepped
to
the
glowing
hearth
and
dropped
the
book
into
the
flames
then
standing
motionless
and
silent
she
watched
with
haggard
eye
the
bluish
light
which
rose
from
the
poisoned
leaves
as
the
book
burned
a
strong
odor
of
arsenic
spread
through
the
room
soon
the
volume
was
entirely
destroyed
and
now
madame
said
charles
with
irresistible
majesty
call
my
brother
catharine
overcome
crushed
under
a
multiple
emotion
which
her
profound
wisdom
could
not
analyze
and
which
her
almost
superhuman
strength
could
not
combat
took
a
step
forward
as
if
to
speak
the
mother
grew
remorseful
the
queen
was
afraid
the
poisoner
felt
a
return
of
hatred
the
latter
sentiment
dominated
curse
him
she
cried
rushing
from
the
room
he
triumphs
he
gains
his
end
curse
him
curse
him
you
understand
my
brother
my
brother
henry
cried
charles
calling
after
his
mother
my
brother
henry
with
whom
i
wish
to
speak
instantly
regarding
the
regency
of
the
kingdom
almost
at
the
same
instant
maître
ambroise
paré
entered
through
the
door
opposite
the
one
by
which
the
queen
had
just
left
and
pausing
on
the
threshold
noticed
the
peculiar
odor
in
the
room
who
has
been
burning
arsenic
here
said
he
i
replied
charles
chapter
lxiii
the
donjon
of
the
prison
of
vincennes
henry
of
navarre
was
strolling
dreamily
along
the
terrace
of
the
prison
he
knew
the
court
was
at
the
château
not
a
hundred
feet
away
and
through
the
walls
it
seemed
as
if
his
piercing
eye
could
picture
charles
as
he
lay
dying
the
weather
was
perfect
a
broad
band
of
sunlight
lay
on
the
distant
fields
bathing
in
liquid
gold
the
tops
of
the
forest
trees
proud
of
the
richness
of
their
first
foliage
the
very
stones
of
the
prison
itself
gray
as
they
were
seemed
impregnated
with
the
gentle
light
of
heaven
and
some
flowers
lured
by
the
breath
of
the
east
wind
had
pushed
through
the
crevices
of
the
wall
and
were
raising
their
disks
of
red
and
yellow
velvet
to
the
kisses
of
the
warm
air
but
henry
eyes
were
fixed
neither
on
the
verdant
plains
nor
on
the
gilded
tree
tops
his
glance
went
beyond
and
was
fixed
full
of
ambition
on
the
capital
of
france
destined
one
day
to
become
the
capital
of
the
world
paris
murmured
the
king
of
navarre
there
is
paris
that
is
joy
triumph
glory
power
and
happiness
paris
in
which
is
the
louvre
and
the
louvre
in
which
is
the
throne
and
only
one
thing
separates
me
from
this
paris
for
which
i
so
long
and
that
something
the
stones
at
my
feet
which
shut
me
in
with
my
enemy
as
he
glanced
from
paris
to
vincennes
he
perceived
on
his
left
in
a
valley
partly
hidden
by
flowering
a
man
whose
cuirass
sparkled
in
the
sunlight
at
its
owner
slightest
movement
this
man
rode
a
fiery
steed
and
led
another
which
seemed
no
less
impatient
the
king
of
navarre
fixed
his
eyes
on
this
cavalier
and
saw
him
draw
his
sword
from
his
sheath
place
his
handkerchief
on
the
point
and
wave
it
like
a
signal
at
the
same
instant
the
signal
was
repeated
from
the
opposite
hill
then
all
around
the
château
a
belt
of
handkerchiefs
seemed
to
flutter
it
was
de
mouy
and
his
huguenots
who
knowing
the
king
was
dying
and
fearing
that
some
attempt
might
be
made
on
henry
life
had
gathered
together
ready
to
defend
or
attack
henry
with
his
eyes
still
on
the
horseman
he
had
seen
first
bent
over
the
balustrade
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
to
keep
out
the
dazzling
rays
of
the
sun
recognized
the
young
huguenot
de
mouy
he
exclaimed
as
though
the
latter
could
hear
him
and
in
his
joy
at
seeing
himself
surrounded
by
friends
the
king
raised
his
hat
and
waved
his
scarf
all
the
white
banners
were
again
set
in
motion
with
an
energy
which
proved
the
joy
of
their
owners
alas
they
are
waiting
for
me
said
henry
and
i
can
not
join
them
why
did
i
not
do
so
when
i
could
now
it
is
too
late
he
made
a
despairing
gesture
to
which
de
mouy
returned
a
sign
which
meant
i
will
wait
just
then
henry
heard
steps
on
the
stone
stairs
he
hastily
withdrew
the
huguenots
understood
the
cause
of
his
sudden
disappearance
and
their
swords
were
returned
to
their
sheaths
and
their
handkerchiefs
disappeared
henry
saw
on
the
stairs
a
woman
whose
quick
breathing
showed
that
she
had
come
in
haste
he
recognized
not
without
the
secret
dread
he
always
felt
on
seeing
her
catharine
de
médicis
behind
her
were
two
guards
who
stopped
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
oh
thought
henry
it
must
be
something
new
and
important
that
makes
the
queen
mother
come
to
seek
me
on
the
balcony
of
the
prison
of
vincennes
catharine
seated
herself
on
a
stone
bench
against
the
battlement
to
recover
her
breath
henry
approached
her
and
with
his
most
gracious
smile
are
you
seeking
me
my
good
mother
yes
monsieur
replied
catharine
i
wish
to
give
you
a
final
proof
of
my
attachment
the
king
is
dying
and
wishes
to
see
you
me
said
henry
with
a
start
of
joy
yes
he
has
been
told
i
am
sure
that
not
only
do
you
covet
the
throne
of
navarre
but
that
of
france
as
well
oh
exclaimed
henry
it
is
not
true
i
know
but
he
believes
it
and
no
doubt
the
object
of
the
interview
he
wishes
with
you
is
to
lay
a
snare
for
you
for
me
yes
before
dying
charles
wants
to
know
what
there
is
to
hope
or
fear
from
you
and
on
your
answer
to
his
offer
mark
you
will
depend
his
final
commands
that
is
your
life
or
death
but
what
will
he
offer
me
how
do
i
know
impossibilities
probably
but
have
you
no
idea
no
but
suppose
for
instance
catharine
paused
what
suppose
he
credited
you
with
these
ambitious
aims
of
yours
he
has
heard
about
suppose
he
should
wish
to
hear
these
aims
from
your
own
lips
suppose
he
should
tempt
you
as
once
they
used
to
tempt
the
guilty
in
order
to
provoke
a
confession
without
torture
suppose
continued
catharine
looking
fixedly
at
henry
he
were
to
offer
you
a
kingdom
the
regency
a
thrill
of
indescribable
joy
pervaded
henry
weary
heart
but
he
guessed
the
snare
and
his
strong
and
supple
soul
rebounded
me
said
he
the
snare
would
be
too
palpable
offer
me
the
regency
when
there
is
you
yourself
and
my
brother
catharine
compressed
her
lips
to
conceal
her
satisfaction
then
said
she
quickly
you
would
refuse
it
the
king
is
dead
thought
henry
and
she
is
laying
a
trap
for
me
aloud
he
said
i
must
first
hear
what
the
king
of
france
has
to
say
for
from
your
own
words
madame
all
this
is
mere
supposition
doubtless
said
catharine
but
you
can
tell
me
your
intentions
why
said
henry
innocently
having
no
pretensions
i
have
no
intentions
that
is
no
answer
said
catharine
feeling
that
time
was
flying
and
giving
way
to
her
anger
you
can
give
some
answer
i
can
not
answer
suppositions
madame
a
positive
resolution
is
so
difficult
and
so
grave
a
thing
to
assume
that
i
must
wait
for
facts
listen
monsieur
said
catharine
there
is
no
time
to
lose
and
we
are
wasting
it
in
vain
discussion
in
toying
with
words
let
us
play
our
rôle
of
king
and
queen
if
you
accept
the
regency
you
are
a
dead
man
the
king
lives
thought
henry
then
aloud
madame
said
he
firmly
god
holds
the
lives
of
men
and
of
kings
in
his
hands
he
will
inspire
me
let
his
majesty
be
informed
that
i
am
ready
to
see
him
reflect
monsieur
during
the
two
years
in
which
i
have
been
persecuted
during
the
month
i
have
been
a
prisoner
replied
henry
bravely
i
have
had
time
to
reflect
madame
and
i
have
reflected
have
the
goodness
therefore
to
go
to
the
king
before
me
and
to
tell
him
that
i
am
following
you
these
two
guards
added
henry
pointing
to
the
soldiers
will
see
that
i
do
not
escape
moreover
that
is
not
my
intention
there
was
such
firmness
in
henry
tone
that
catharine
saw
that
all
her
attempts
under
whatever
disguise
would
not
succeed
therefore
she
hastily
descended
as
soon
as
she
had
disappeared
henry
went
to
the
parapet
and
made
a
sign
to
de
mouy
which
meant
draw
near
and
be
ready
in
case
of
necessity
de
mouy
who
had
dismounted
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
still
leading
the
second
horse
galloped
to
within
of
the
prison
henry
thanked
him
by
a
gesture
and
descended
on
the
first
landing
he
found
the
two
soldiers
who
were
waiting
for
him
a
double
troop
of
swiss
and
guarded
the
entrance
to
the
court
and
to
enter
or
leave
the
château
it
was
necessary
to
traverse
a
double
line
of
halberds
catharine
had
stopped
and
was
waiting
for
him
she
signed
to
the
two
soldiers
to
go
on
and
laying
her
hand
on
arm
said
this
court
has
two
gates
at
one
behind
the
apartments
of
the
king
if
you
refuse
the
regency
a
good
horse
and
freedom
await
you
at
the
other
through
which
you
have
just
passed
if
you
listen
to
the
voice
of
ambition
what
do
you
say
i
say
that
if
the
king
makes
me
regent
madame
i
and
not
you
shall
give
orders
to
the
soldiers
i
say
that
if
i
leave
the
castle
at
night
all
these
pikes
halberds
and
muskets
shall
be
lowered
before
me
madman
murmured
catharine
exasperated
believe
me
and
do
not
play
this
terrible
game
of
life
and
death
with
me
why
not
said
henry
looking
closely
at
catharine
why
not
with
you
as
well
as
with
another
since
up
to
this
time
i
have
won
go
to
the
king
apartments
monsieur
since
you
are
unwilling
to
believe
or
listen
to
anything
said
catharine
pointing
to
the
stairway
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
toying
with
one
of
the
two
poisoned
daggers
she
always
wore
in
the
black
shagreen
case
which
has
become
historical
pass
before
me
madame
said
henry
so
long
as
i
am
not
regent
the
honor
of
precedence
belongs
to
you
catharine
thwarted
in
all
her
plans
did
not
attempt
to
struggle
but
ascended
the
stairs
ahead
of
the
king
of
navarre
chapter
lxiv
the
regency
the
king
beginning
to
grow
impatient
had
summoned
monsieur
de
nancey
to
his
room
and
had
just
given
him
orders
to
go
in
search
of
henry
when
the
latter
appeared
on
seeing
his
at
the
door
charles
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
but
henry
stood
motionless
as
startled
as
if
he
had
come
face
to
face
with
a
corpse
the
two
physicians
who
were
at
the
bedside
and
the
priest
who
had
been
with
charles
withdrew
charles
was
not
loved
and
yet
many
were
weeping
in
the
antechambers
at
the
death
of
kings
good
or
bad
there
are
always
persons
who
lose
something
and
who
fear
they
will
not
find
it
again
under
the
successor
the
mourning
the
sobbing
the
words
of
catharine
the
sinister
and
majestic
surroundings
of
the
last
moments
of
a
king
the
sight
of
the
king
himself
suffering
from
a
malady
common
enough
afterwards
but
which
at
that
time
was
new
to
science
produced
on
henry
mind
which
was
still
youthful
and
consequently
still
susceptible
such
a
terrible
impression
that
in
spite
of
his
determination
not
to
cause
charles
fresh
anxiety
as
to
his
condition
he
could
not
as
we
have
said
repress
the
feeling
of
terror
which
came
to
his
face
on
perceiving
the
dying
man
dripping
with
blood
charles
smiled
sadly
nothing
of
those
around
them
escapes
the
dying
come
henriot
said
he
extending
his
hand
with
a
gentleness
of
voice
henry
had
never
before
noticed
in
him
come
in
i
have
been
very
unhappy
at
not
seeing
you
for
so
long
i
have
tormented
you
greatly
during
my
life
my
poor
friend
and
sometimes
believe
me
i
have
reproached
myself
for
it
sometimes
i
have
taken
the
hands
of
those
who
tormented
you
it
is
true
but
a
king
can
not
control
circumstances
and
besides
my
mother
catharine
my
brothers
and
i
had
to
consider
during
my
lifetime
something
else
which
was
troublesome
and
which
ceases
the
moment
i
draw
near
to
death
state
policy
sire
murmured
henry
i
remember
only
the
love
i
have
always
had
for
my
brother
the
respect
i
have
always
felt
for
my
king
yes
yes
you
are
right
said
charles
and
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
saying
this
henriot
for
truly
you
have
suffered
a
great
deal
under
my
reign
without
counting
the
fact
that
it
was
during
my
reign
that
your
poor
mother
died
but
you
must
have
seen
that
i
was
often
driven
sometimes
i
have
resisted
but
oftener
i
have
yielded
from
very
fatigue
but
as
you
said
let
us
not
talk
of
the
past
now
it
is
the
present
which
concerns
me
it
is
the
future
which
frightens
me
and
the
poor
king
hid
his
livid
face
in
his
emaciated
hands
after
a
moment
silence
he
shook
his
head
as
if
to
drive
away
all
gloomy
thoughts
thus
causing
a
shower
of
blood
to
fall
about
him
we
must
save
the
state
he
continued
in
a
low
tone
leaning
towards
henry
we
must
prevent
its
falling
into
the
hands
of
fanatics
or
women
as
we
have
just
said
charles
uttered
these
words
in
a
low
tone
yet
henry
thought
he
heard
behind
the
headboard
something
like
a
dull
exclamation
of
anger
perhaps
some
opening
made
in
the
wall
at
the
instigation
of
charles
himself
permitted
catharine
to
hear
this
final
conversation
of
women
said
the
king
of
navarre
to
provoke
an
explanation
yes
henry
said
charles
my
mother
wishes
the
regency
until
my
brother
returns
from
poland
but
mind
what
i
tell
you
he
will
not
come
back
why
not
cried
henry
whose
heart
gave
a
joyful
leap
no
he
can
not
return
continued
charles
because
his
subjects
will
not
let
him
leave
but
said
henry
do
you
not
suppose
brother
that
the
queen
mother
has
already
written
to
him
yes
but
nancey
stopped
the
courier
at
château
thierry
and
brought
me
the
letter
in
which
she
said
i
was
to
die
i
wrote
to
varsovia
myself
my
letter
reached
there
i
am
sure
and
my
brother
will
be
watched
so
in
all
probability
henry
the
throne
will
be
vacant
a
second
sound
louder
than
the
first
was
heard
in
the
alcove
she
is
surely
there
thought
henry
and
is
listening
charles
heard
nothing
now
he
continued
i
am
dying
without
male
heir
then
he
stopped
a
sweet
thought
seemed
to
light
up
his
face
and
laying
his
hand
on
the
king
of
navarre
shoulder
alas
said
he
do
you
remember
henriot
the
poor
little
boy
i
showed
you
one
evening
sleeping
in
his
silken
cradle
watched
over
by
an
angel
alas
henriot
they
will
kill
him
oh
sire
cried
henry
whose
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
swear
to
you
that
i
will
watch
over
him
all
the
days
and
nights
of
my
life
command
me
my
king
thanks
henriot
thanks
said
charles
with
a
show
of
feeling
unusual
in
him
but
which
the
situation
had
roused
i
accept
your
promise
do
not
make
him
a
king
fortunately
he
was
not
born
for
a
throne
but
make
him
happy
i
have
left
him
an
independent
fortune
let
him
inherit
his
mother
nobility
that
of
the
heart
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
him
if
he
were
to
enter
the
church
he
would
inspire
less
fear
oh
it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
die
if
not
happy
at
least
calm
if
i
had
the
kisses
of
the
child
and
the
sweet
face
of
its
mother
to
console
me
sire
could
you
not
send
for
them
ah
poor
wretches
they
would
never
be
allowed
to
leave
the
louvre
such
is
the
condition
of
kings
henriot
they
can
neither
live
nor
die
as
they
please
but
since
you
promise
i
am
more
resigned
henry
reflected
yes
no
doubt
my
king
i
have
promised
but
can
i
keep
my
word
what
do
you
mean
shall
i
not
be
persecuted
and
threatened
like
him
even
more
than
him
for
i
am
a
man
and
he
is
only
a
child
you
are
mistaken
said
charles
after
my
death
you
shall
be
great
and
powerful
here
is
what
will
make
you
so
and
the
king
drew
a
parchment
from
under
the
pillow
see
said
he
henry
glanced
over
the
document
sealed
with
the
royal
seal
the
regency
for
me
sire
said
he
growing
pale
with
joy
yes
for
you
until
the
return
of
the
duc
and
as
in
all
probability
the
duke
will
never
return
it
is
not
the
regency
only
but
the
throne
that
this
gives
you
the
throne
murmured
henry
yes
said
charles
you
alone
are
worthy
of
it
you
alone
are
capable
of
governing
these
debauched
gallants
and
these
bold
women
who
live
by
blood
and
tears
my
brother
is
a
traitor
and
would
deceive
every
one
leave
him
in
the
prison
in
which
i
have
placed
him
my
mother
will
try
to
kill
you
therefore
banish
her
my
brother
in
three
or
four
months
perhaps
in
a
year
will
leave
varsovia
and
will
come
to
dispute
the
throne
with
you
answer
him
by
a
bull
from
the
pope
i
have
already
arranged
that
matter
through
my
ambassador
the
duc
de
nevers
and
you
will
receive
the
document
before
long
oh
my
king
you
have
but
one
thing
to
fear
henry
civil
war
but
by
remaining
converted
you
will
avoid
this
for
the
huguenots
are
strong
only
when
you
put
yourself
at
their
head
and
monsieur
de
condé
is
nothing
when
opposed
to
you
france
is
a
country
of
plains
henry
and
consequently
a
catholic
country
the
king
of
france
ought
to
be
the
king
of
the
catholics
and
not
the
king
of
the
huguenots
for
the
king
of
france
ought
to
be
the
king
of
the
majority
it
is
said
i
feel
remorse
for
the
massacre
of
saint
bartholomew
doubts
yes
remorse
no
it
is
said
i
am
bleeding
the
blood
of
those
huguenots
from
every
pore
i
know
what
is
flowing
from
me
it
is
arsenic
and
not
blood
what
do
you
mean

it
must
be
avenged
by

speak
now
of
the
future
i
leave
you
a
faithful
parliament
and
a
trusty
army
lean
on
them
and
they
will
protect
you
against
your
only
enemies
my
mother
and
the
duc
just
then
the
sound
of
arms
and
military
commands
were
heard
in
the
vestibule
i
am
dead
murmured
henry
you
fear
you
hesitate
said
charles
anxiously
i
sire
replied
henry
no
i
do
not
fear
nor
do
i
hesitate
i
accept
charles
pressed
henry
hand
at
that
moment
the
nurse
approached
with
a
drink
she
had
been
preparing
in
the
adjoining
room
not
knowing
that
the
fate
of
france
was
being
decided
three
feet
from
her
call
my
mother
nurse
and
have
monsieur
also
summoned
chapter
lxv
the
king
is
dead
long
live
the
king
a
few
moments
later
catharine
and
the
duc
pale
with
fright
and
trembling
with
rage
entered
charles
room
as
henry
had
conjectured
catharine
had
overheard
everything
and
in
a
few
words
had
told
all
to
françois
henry
was
standing
at
the
head
of
charles
bed
the
king
spoke
his
wishes
madame
said
he
to
his
mother
had
i
a
son
you
would
be
regent
or
in
default
of
you
it
would
be
the
king
of
poland
or
in
default
of
him
it
would
be
my
brother
françois
but
i
have
no
son
and
after
me
the
throne
belongs
to
my
brother
the
duc
who
is
absent
as
some
day
he
will
claim
this
throne
i
do
not
wish
him
to
find
in
his
place
a
man
who
by
almost
equal
rights
might
dispute
it
with
him
and
who
consequently
might
expose
the
kingdom
to
civil
war
this
is
why
i
do
not
appoint
you
regent
madame
for
you
would
have
to
choose
between
your
two
sons
which
would
be
painful
for
a
mother
this
is
why
i
do
not
choose
my
brother
françois
for
he
might
say
to
his
elder
brother
had
a
throne
why
did
you
leave
it
no
i
have
chosen
as
regent
one
who
can
take
the
crown
on
trust
and
who
will
keep
it
in
his
hand
and
not
on
his
head
salute
this
regent
madame
salute
him
brother
it
is
the
king
of
navarre
and
with
a
gesture
of
supreme
authority
the
king
himself
saluted
henry
catharine
and
made
a
gesture
between
a
nervous
shudder
and
a
salute
here
my
lord
regent
said
charles
to
the
king
of
navarre
here
is
the
parchment
which
until
the
return
of
the
king
of
poland
gives
you
the
command
of
the
armies
the
keys
of
the
treasury
and
the
royal
power
and
authority
catharine
devoured
henry
with
her
eyes
françois
swayed
so
that
he
could
scarcely
stand
but
this
weakness
of
the
one
and
strength
of
the
other
instead
of
encouraging
henry
showed
him
the
danger
which
threatened
him
nevertheless
he
made
a
violent
effort
and
overcoming
his
fears
took
the
parchment
from
the
hands
of
the
king
raised
himself
to
his
full
height
and
gave
catharine
and
françois
a
look
which
meant
take
care
i
am
your
master
no
said
she
never
never
shall
my
race
bow
to
a
foreign
one
never
shall
a
bourbon
reign
in
france
while
a
valois
remains
mother
cried
charles
sitting
up
among
the
crimson
sheets
of
his
bed
more
frightful
looking
than
ever
take
care
i
am
still
king
not
for
long
i
well
know
but
it
does
not
take
long
to
give
an
order
it
does
not
take
long
to
punish
murderers
and
poisoners
well
give
the
order
if
you
dare
and
i
will
give
mine
come
françois
come
and
the
queen
left
the
room
rapidly
followed
by
the
duc
nancey
cried
charles
nancey
come
here
i
order
you
nancey
to
arrest
my
mother
and
my
brother
arrest
a
stream
of
blood
choked
his
utterance
just
as
the
captain
of
the
guards
opened
the
door
and
almost
suffocated
the
king
fell
back
on
his
bed
nancey
had
heard
only
his
name
the
orders
which
followed
and
which
had
been
uttered
in
a
less
audible
tone
were
lost
in
space
guard
the
door
said
henry
and
let
no
one
enter
nancey
bowed
and
withdrew
henry
looked
at
the
almost
lifeless
body
which
already
would
have
seemed
like
that
of
a
corpse
had
not
a
light
breath
stirred
the
fringe
of
foam
on
the
lips
henry
looked
for
several
moments
then
speaking
to
himself
the
final
moment
has
come
said
he
shall
i
reign
shall
i
live
just
then
the
tapestry
of
the
alcove
was
raised
a
pale
face
appeared
behind
it
and
a
voice
vibrated
through
the
silence
of
death
which
reigned
throughout
the
royal
chamber
live
said
this
voice
réné
cried
henry
yes
sire
your
prediction
was
false
then
i
shall
not
be
king
you
shall
be
sire
but
the
time
has
not
yet
come
how
do
you
know
speak
that
i
may
know
if
i
may
believe
you
listen
well
stoop
down
henry
leaned
over
charles
réné
did
the
same
they
were
separated
by
the
width
of
the
bed
alone
and
even
this
distance
was
lessened
by
their
positions
between
them
silent
and
motionless
lay
the
dying
king
listen
said
réné
placed
here
by
the
queen
mother
to
ruin
you
i
prefer
to
serve
you
for
i
have
faith
in
your
horoscope
by
serving
you
i
shall
profit
both
in
body
and
soul
did
the
queen
mother
command
you
to
say
this
also
asked
henry
full
of
doubt
and
pain
no
said
réné
but
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
he
leaned
still
further
over
henry
did
likewise
so
that
their
heads
almost
touched
this
interview
between
two
men
bending
over
the
body
of
a
dying
king
was
so
sombre
that
the
hair
of
the
superstitious
florentine
rose
on
end
and
henry
face
became
covered
with
perspiration
listen
continued
réné
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
known
only
to
me
i
will
reveal
it
to
you
if
you
will
swear
over
this
dying
man
to
forgive
me
for
the
death
of
your
mother
i
have
already
promised
you
this
said
henry
with
darkening
brow
you
promised
but
you
did
not
swear
said
réné
drawing
back
i
swear
it
said
henry
raising
his
right
hand
over
the
head
of
the
king
well
sire
said
the
florentine
hastily
the
king
of
poland
will
soon
arrive
no
said
henry
the
messenger
was
stopped
by
king
charles
king
charles
intercepted
only
the
one
on
the
road
to
château
thierry
but
the
queen
mother
wisely
sent
couriers
by
three
different
routes
oh
i
am
lost
exclaimed
henry
a
messenger
arrived
this
morning
from
varsovia
the
king
left
after
him
without
any
one
thinking
of
opposing
him
for
at
varsovia
the
illness
of
the
king
of
france
was
not
yet
known
this
courier
only
preceded
henry
of
anjou
by
a
few
hours
oh
had
i
but
eight
days
cried
henry
yes
but
you
have
not
eight
hours
did
you
hear
the
noise
of
arms
yes
they
are
making
ready
to
kill
you
they
will
seek
you
even
here
in
the
apartment
of
the
king
the
king
is
not
yet
dead
réné
looked
closely
at
charles
he
will
be
in
ten
minutes
you
have
ten
minutes
to
live
therefore
perhaps
less
what
shall
i
do
flee
instantly
without
delaying
a
minute
a
second
but
how
if
they
are
waiting
in
the
antechamber
they
will
kill
me
as
i
go
out
listen
i
will
risk
everything
for
you
never
forget
this
fear
not
follow
me
by
the
secret
corridor
i
will
lead
you
to
the
postern
then
to
gain
time
i
will
tell
the
queen
mother
that
you
are
coming
down
you
will
be
seen
to
have
discovered
this
secret
passage
and
to
have
profited
by
it
to
escape
flee

nurse
murmured
charles
nurse
henry
took
from
the
bed
charles
sword
of
no
further
use
to
the
dying
king
put
the
parchment
which
made
him
regent
in
his
breast
kissed
charles
brow
for
the
last
time
and
turning
away
hurried
through
the
door
which
closed
behind
him
nurse
cried
the
king
in
a
stronger
voice
nurse
the
woman
ran
to
him
what
is
it
charlot
she
asked
nurse
said
the
king
his
eye
dilated
by
the
terrible
fixity
of
death
something
must
have
happened
while
i
slept
i
see
a
great
light
i
see

king
and
remember
only
the
suffering
of
the
man

god

come
and
charles
who
as
he
spoke
had
risen
more
and
more
as
if
to
go
to
the
one
who
was
calling
him
after
uttering
these
words
heaved
a
sigh
and
fell
back
still
and
cold
in
the
arms
of
his
nurse
meantime
while
the
soldiers
commanded
by
catharine
were
beginning
to
fill
the
main
corridor
in
which
they
expected
henry
to
appear
the
latter
guided
by
réné
passed
along
the
secret
passage
and
reached
the
postern
sprang
on
the
horse
which
was
waiting
for
him
and
galloped
to
the
place
where
he
knew
he
would
find

the
sound
of
the
horse

the
galloping
of
which
fell
on

sentinels
turned
and
cried

the

stepping
to

window
the
king
of
navarre
cried
the
sentinels
fire
on
him

cried
catharine
the
sentinels
levelled
their
muskets
but
henry
was
already
too
far
away
he
flees
cried
the
queen
mother
then
he
is
vanquished
he
flees
murmured
the
duc
then
i
am
king
at
that
instant
while
françois
and
his
mother
were
still
before
the
window
the
drawbridge
thundered
under
horses
hoofs
and
preceded
by
a
clanking
of
arms
and
great
noise
a
young
man
galloped
up
his
hat
in
his
hand
shouting
as
he
entered
the
court
france
he
was
followed
by
four
gentlemen
covered
like
himself
with
perspiration
dust
and
foam
my
son
exclaimed
catharine
extending
both
arms
out
of
the
window

replied
the
young
man
springing
from
his
steed
my
brother
cried
françois
stepping
back
in
amazement

too
late
asked
henry

you
for
you

arrived
at
a
better
moment
look
and

monsieur
de
nancey
captain
of
the
guards
had
come
out
upon
the
balcony
from
the
chamber
of
the
king
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
him
breaking
a
wand
in
two
with
arms
extended
he
took
a
piece
in
either
hand
and
cried
three
times
king
charles

he
dropped

sign
of
the
cross
long

took
up

chapter
lxvi
epilogue
one
year
had
elapsed
since
the
death
of
charles
ix
and
the
accession
of
his
successor
to
the
throne
king
henry
happily
reigning
by
the
grace
of
god
and
his
mother
catharine
was
attending
a
fine
procession
given
in
honor
of
notre
dame
de
cléry
he
had
gone
on
foot
with
the
queen
his
wife
and
all
the
court
king
henry
iii
could
well
afford
this
little
pastime
for
no
serious
business
occupied
him
for
the
moment
the
king
of
navarre
was
in
navarre
where
he
had
so
long
desired
to
be
and
where
he
was
said
to
be
very
much
taken
up
with
a
beautiful
girl
of
the
blood
of
the
montmorencies
whom
he
called
la
fosseuse
marguerite
was
with
him
sad
and
gloomy
finding
in
the
beautiful
mountains
not
distraction
but
a
softening
of
the
two
greatest
griefs
of
life
absence
and
death
paris
was
very
quiet
and
the
queen
mother
really
regent
since
her
dear
son
henry
had
been
king
resided
sometimes
at
the
louvre
sometimes
at
the
hôtel
de
soissons
which
occupied
the
site
covered
by
the
halle
au
blé
of
which
nothing
remains
beyond
the
beautiful
column
which
is
still
standing
one
evening
when
she
was
deeply
engaged
in
studying
the
stars
with
réné
of
whose
little
act
of
treason
she
was
still
ignorant
and
who
had
been
reinstated
in
her
favor
after
the
false
testimony
he
had
so
opportunely
given
at
the
trial
of
coconnas
and
la
mole
she
was
informed
that
a
man
waited
for
her
in
her
oratory
with
something
to
tell
her
of
the
greatest
importance
hastily
descending
the
queen
found
the
sire
de
maurevel
is
here
cried
the
ancient
captain
of
the
guards
not
giving
catharine
time
to
address
him
according
to
royal
etiquette
what
demanded
catharine
who
but
the
king
of
navarre
madame
here
said
catharine
here
he
henry
and
what
has
he
come
for
the
madman
if
appearances
are
to
be
believed
he
comes
to
see
madame
de
sauve
that
is
all
if
probabilities
are
to
be
considered
he
comes
to
conspire
against
the
king
how
do
you
know
he
is
here
yesterday
i
saw
him
enter
a
house
and
an
instant
later
madame
de
sauve
joined
him
there
are
you
sure
it
was
he
i
waited
until
he
came
out
that
is
part
of
the
night
at
three
the
two
lovers
appeared
the
king
led
madame
de
sauve
as
far
as
the
gate
of
the
louvre
where
thanks
to
the
porter
who
no
doubt
is
in
her
pay
she
was
admitted
without
opposition
and
the
king
returned
humming
a
tune
and
with
a
step
as
free
as
if
he
were
among
his
own
mountains
where
did
he
go
then
to
the
rue
de
sec
hôtel
de
la
belle
étoile
the
same
inn
in
which
the
two
sorcerers
used
to
lodge
whom
your
majesty
had
executed
a
year
ago
why
did
you
not
come
and
tell
me
this
at
once
because
i
was
not
yet
sure
of
my
man
and
now
now
i
am
certain
did
you
see
him
yes
i
hid
in
a
wine
merchant
opposite
i
saw
him
enter
the
same
building
as
on
the
previous
night
then
as
madame
de
sauve
was
late
he
imprudently
put
his
face
against
the
window
pane
on
the
first
floor
and
i
had
no
further
doubt
besides
a
few
minutes
later
madame
de
sauve
came
and
again
joined
him
do
you
think
that
like
last
night
they
will
remain
until
three
in
the
morning
it
is
probable
where
is
the
house
near
the
croix
des
petits
champs
close
to
saint
honoré
very
good
said
catharine
does
monsieur
de
sauve
know
your
handwriting
no
sit
down
then
and
write
maurevel
took
a
pen
and
obeyed
i
am
ready
madame
said
he
catharine
dictated
the
baron
de
sauve
is
on
service
at
the
louvre
the
baroness
is
with
one
of
her
friends
in
a
house
near
the
croix
des
petits
champs
close
to
saint
honoré
the
baron
de
sauve
will
know
the
house
by
a
red
cross
on
the
well
said
maurevel
make
a
copy
of
the
letter
said
catharine
maurevel
obeyed
in
silence
now
said
the
queen
have
one
of
these
letters
taken
by
a
clever
man
to
the
baron
de
sauve
and
drop
the
other
in
the
corridors
of
the
louvre
i
do
not
understand
said
maurevel
catharine
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
do
not
understand
that
a
husband
who
receives
such
a
note
will
be
angry
but
the
king
of
navarre
never
used
to
be
angry
madame
it
is
not
always
with
a
king
as
with
a
simple
courtier
besides
if
de
sauve
is
not
angry
you
can
be
so
for
him
i
yes
you
can
take
four
men
or
six
if
necessary
put
on
a
mask

the
next
day
the
note
dropped
in
the
corridor
of
the
louvre
and
picked
up
by
some
kind
friend
who
already
will
have
circulated
the
news
will
prove
that
it
was
the
husband
who
had
avenged
himself
only
by
chance
the
gallant
happened
to
be
king
of
navarre
but
who
would
have
imagined
that
when
every
one
thought
him
at
pau
maurevel
looked
at
catharine
in
admiration
bowed
and
withdrew
as
maurevel
left
the
hôtel
de
soissons
madame
de
sauve
entered
the
small
house
near
the
croix
des
petits
champs
henry
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
door
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
on
the
stairs
he
said

not
been
followed

old
friends

harm

be
inconsolable

my
love
said
the
béarnais
we
have
three
swordsmen
watching
in
the
darkness
three
are
very
few
sire
three
are
enough
when
they
are
de
mouy
saucourt
and
barthélemy
is
de
mouy
in
paris
with
you
certainly
he
dared
to
return
to
the
capital
has
he
then
like
you
some
poor
woman
who
is
in
love
with
him
no
but
he
has
an
enemy

death
he
has
sworn
to

dear

many
follies

you
sire
oh
said
henry
i
do
not
refer
to
our
present
follies
i
mean
those
of
the
past
and
the
future
but
do
not
let

discuss
this
we
have
no
time
to
lose
you

to
leave
paris

your
affairs

you
back
to
paris

i
came
back
only
to
see
you
gascon
saint
gris
my
love
that
is
true
but
let
us
put
aside
such
thoughts
i
have
still
two
or
three
hours
in
which
to
be
happy
then
farewell
forever
ah
sire
said
madame
de
sauve
nothing
is
forever
except
my
love
henry
had
just
said
that
he
had
no
time
for
discussion
therefore
he
did
not
discuss
this
point
he
believed
or
sceptic
that
he
was
he
pretended
to
believe
as
the
king
of
navarre
had
said
de
mouy
and
his
two
companions
were
hidden
near
by
it
was
arranged
that
henry
should
leave
the
small
house
at
midnight
instead
of
at
three
that
as
on
the
previous
night
they
would
escort
madame
de
sauve
back
to
the
louvre
and
from
there
they
would
go
to
the
rue
de
la
cerisaie
where
maurevel
lived
it
was
only
during
that
day
that
de
mouy
had
been
sure
of
his
whereabouts
the
men
had
been
on
guard
about
an
hour
when
they
perceived
a
man
followed
at
a
few
feet
by
five
others
who
drew
near
to
the
door
of
the
small
house
and
tried
several
keys
successively
de
mouy
concealed
within
the
shelter
of
a
neighboring
door
made
one
bound
from
his
and
seized
the
man
by
the
arm
one
moment
said
he
you
can
not
enter
there
the
man
sprang
back
and
in
doing
so
his
hat
fell
off
de
mouy
de
saint
phale
he
cried
maurevel
thundered
the
huguenot
raising
his
sword
i
sought
you
and
you
have
come
to
me
thanks
but
his
anger
did
not
make
him
forget
henry
and
turning
to
the
window
he
whistled
in
the
manner
of
the
béarnais
shepherds
that
will
be
enough
said
he
to
saucourt
now
then
murderer
and
he
sprang
towards
maurevel
the
latter
had
had
time
to
draw
a
pistol
from
his
belt
ah
now
said
the
king
slayer
aiming
at
the
young
man
i
think
you
are
a
dead
man
he
fired
de
mouy
jumped
to
one
side
and
the
ball
passed
by
without
touching
him
it
is
my
turn
now
cried
the
young
man
and
he
dealt
maurevel
such
a
violent
thrust
with
his
sword
that
although
the
blade
had
to
encounter
his
buff
belt
the
sharp
point
pierced
this
obstacle
and
sank
into
the
flesh
the
assassin
gave
a
terrible
cry
of
pain
whereupon
the
soldiers
with
him
thinking
he
was
killed
fled
in
alarm
down
the
rue
saint
honoré
maurevel
was
not
brave
seeing
himself
abandoned
by
his
followers
and
having
to
face
an
adversary
like
de
mouy
he
strove
to
escape
and
ran
after
the
guard
shouting
help
help
de
mouy
saucourt
and
barthélemy
carried
away
by
their
ardor
pursued
him
as
they
entered
the
rue
de
grenelle
which
they
had
taken
as
a
short
cut
a
window
opened
and
a
man
sprang
out
from
the
first
floor
landing
on
the
ground
lately
wet
by
the
rain
it
was
henry
de
mouy
whistle
had
warned
him
of
some
danger
and
the
had
showed
him
that
the
danger
was
great
and
had
drawn
him
to
the
aid
of
his
friends
energetic
and
vigorous
he
dashed
after
them
sword
in
hand
a
cry
guided
him
it
came
from
the
barrier
des
sergents
it
was
maurevel
who
being
hard
pressed
by
de
mouy
was
calling
a
second
time
for
help
from
his
men
who
had
run
away
maurevel
had
to
turn
or
be
run
through
the
back
he
turned
therefore
and
meeting
his
enemy
steel
gave
him
back
so
skilful
a
thrust
that
the
scarf
of
the
latter
was
cut
through
but
de
mouy
at
once
lunged
the
sword
again
sank
into
the
flesh
it
had
already
broken
and
a
second
jet
of
blood
spurted
from
a
second
wound
at
him
cried
henry
coming
up
quick
quick
de
mouy
de
mouy
needed
no
encouragement
again
he
charged
at
maurevel
but
the
latter
had
not
waited
pressing
his
left
hand
over
his
wound
he
again
took
to
flight
kill
him
quick
kill
him
cried
the
king
here
are
the
soldiers
and
the
despair
of
cowards
is
of
no
moment
to
the
brave
maurevel
who
was
well
nigh
exhausted
whose
every
breath
caused
a
bloody
perspiration
fell
down
but
almost
immediately
he
rose
again
and
turning
on
one
knee
presented
the
point
of
his
sword
to
de
mouy
friends
friends
cried
maurevel
there
are
only
two
fire
at
them
fire
saucourt
and
barthélemy
had
gone
in
pursuit
of
the
other
soldiers
down
the
rue
des
poulies
and
the
king
and
de
mouy
were
alone
with
the
four
men
fire
cried
maurevel
again
while
one
of
the
soldiers
levelled
his
gun
yes
but
first
said
de
mouy
die
traitor
murderer
assassin
and
seizing
maurevel
sword
with
one
hand
with
the
other
he
plunged
his
own
up
to
its
hilt
into
the
breast
of
his
enemy
with
such
force
that
he
nailed
him
to
the
earth
take
care
take
care
cried
henry
de
mouy
sprang
back
leaving
his
sword
in
maurevel
body
just
as
a
soldier
was
in
the
act
of
firing
at
him
henry
at
once
passed
his
sword
through
the
body
of
the
soldier
who
gave
a
cry
and
fell
by
the
side
of
maurevel
the
two
others
took
to
flight
come
de
mouy
come
cried
henry
let
us
not
lose
an
instant
if
we
are
recognized
it
will
be
all
over
with
us
wait
sire
do
you
suppose
i
want
to
leave
my
sword
in
the
body
of
this
wretch
and
de
mouy
approached
maurevel
who
lay
apparently
without
sign
of
life
but
just
as
he
took
hold
of
his
sword
which
was
run
through
body
the
latter
raised
himself
and
with
the
gun
the
soldier
had
dropped
fired
directly
at
de
mouy
breast
the
young
man
fell
without
a
cry
he
was
killed
outright
henry
rushed
at
maurevel
but
the
latter
had
fallen
again
and
the
king
sword
pierced
only
a
dead
body
it
was
necessary
to
flee
the
noise
had
attracted
a
large
number
of
persons
the
night
watch
might
arrive
at
any
moment
henry
looked
around
to
see
if
there
was
any
face
he
knew
and
gave
a
cry
of
delight
on
recognizing
la
hurière
as
the
scene
had
occurred
at
the
foot
of
the
croix
du
trahoir
that
is
opposite
the
rue
de
sec
our
old
friend
whose
naturally
gloomy
disposition
had
been
still
further
saddened
since
the
death
of
la
mole
and
coconnas
his
two
favorite
lodgers
had
left
his
furnaces
and
his
pans
in
the
midst
of
his
preparations
for
the
king
of
navarre
supper
and
had
run
to
the
fight
my
dear
la
hurière
i
commend
de
mouy
to
your
care
although
i
greatly
fear
nothing
can
be
done
for
him
take
him
to
your
inn
and
if
he
still
live
spare
nothing
here
is
my
purse
as
to
the
other
leave
him
in
the
gutter
that
he
may
die
like
a
dog
and
yourself
said
la
hurière
i
have
a
farewell
to
make
i
must
hasten
but
in
ten
minutes
i
shall
be
with
you
have
my
horses
ready
henry
immediately
set
out
towards
the
croix
des
petits
champs
but
as
he
turned
from
the
rue
de
grenelle
he
stopped
in
terror
a
large
crowd
was
before
the
door
what
is
the
matter
asked
henry
what
is
going
on
in
the
house
oh
answered
the
man
addressed
a
terrible
affair
monsieur
a
beautiful
young
woman
has
just
been
stabbed
by
her
husband
to
whom
a
note
had
been
given
informing
him
that
his
wife
was
here
with
her
lover
and
the
husband
cried
henry
has
escaped
and
the
wife
she
is
in
the
house
dead
not
yet
but
thank
god
there
is
scarcely
any
hope
oh
exclaimed
henry
i
am
accursed
indeed
and
he
rushed
into
the
house
the
room
was
full
of
people
standing
around
a
bed
on
which
lay
poor
charlotte
who
had
been
stabbed
twice
her
husband
who
had
hidden
his
jealousy
for
two
years
had
seized
this
opportunity
to
avenge
himself
on
her
charlotte
charlotte
cried
henry
pushing
through
the
crowd
and
falling
on
his
knees
before
the
bed
charlotte
opened
her
beautiful
eyes
already
veiled
by
death
and
uttered
a
cry
which
caused
the
blood
to
flow
afresh
from
her
two
wounds
making
an
effort
to
rise
she
said
oh
i
well
knew
i
could
not
die
without
seeing
you
again
and
as
if
she
had
waited
only
for
that
moment
to
return
to
henry
the
soul
he
had
so
loved
she
pressed
her
lips
to
the
king
forehead
again
whispered
for
a
last
time
i
love
you
and
fell
back
dead
henry
could
not
remain
longer
without
risking
his
own
life
he
drew
his
dagger
cut
a
lock
of
the
beautiful
blonde
hair
which
he
had
so
often
loosened
that
he
might
admire
its
length
and
went
out
sobbing
in
the
midst
of
the
tears
of
all
present
who
did
not
doubt
but
that
they
were
weeping
for
persons
of
high
degree
friend
mistress
cried
henry
in
despair
all
forsake
me
all
leave
me
all
fail
me
at
once
yes
sire
said
a
man
in
a
low
tone
who
had
left
the
group
in
front
of
the
house
and
who
had
followed
henry
but
you
still
have
the
throne

exclaimed
henry

said
the
florentine
pointing
to
a

appeared
from
behind
the
folds

a
black
cloud
it
is
not
