extensive
research
did
not
uncover
any
evidence
that
the
copyright
on
this
publication
was
renewed
obviously
no
conqueror
wants
his
subjects
to
revolt
against
his
rule
obviously
this
one
would
go
to
any
lengths
to
start
a
rebellion
i
the
biotechnicians
had
been
very
thorough
i
was
already
a
little
undersized
which
meant
that
my
height
and
build
were
suitable
i
could
pass
for
a
big
earthling
and
of
course
my
face
and
hands
and
so
on
were
all
right
the
earthlings
being
a
remarkably
humanoid
race
but
the
technicians
had
had
to
remodel
my
ears
blunting
the
tips
and
grafting
on
lobes
and
cutting
the
muscles
that
move
them
my
crest
had
to
go
and
a
scalp
covered
with
revolting
hair
was
now
on
the
top
of
my
skull
finally
and
most
difficult
there
had
been
the
matter
of
skin
color
it
just
was
possible
to
eliminate
my
natural
coppery
pigmentation
so
they
had
injected
a
substance
akin
to
melanin
together
with
a
virus
which
would
manufacture
it
in
my
body
the
result
being
a
leathery
brown
i
could
pass
for
a
member
of
the
white
subspecies
one
who
had
spent
most
of
his
life
in
the
open
the
mimicry
was
perfect
i
hardly
recognized
the
creature
that
looked
out
of
the
mirror
my
lean
square
face
gray
eyes
and
big
hands
were
the
same
or
nearly
so
but
my
black
crest
had
been
replaced
with
a
shock
of
blond
hair
my
ears
were
small
and
immobile
my
skin
a
dull
bronze
and
several
of
earth
languages
were
hypnotically
implanted
in
my
brain
together
with
a
set
of
habits
and
reflexes
making
up
a
which
should
be
immune
to
any
tests
that
the
rebels
could
think
of
i
earthling
and
the
disguise
was
the
hair
grew
and
the
skin
color
was
kept
permanent
by
the
artificial
disease
the
biotechnicians
had
told
me
that
if
i
kept
the
disguise
long
enough
till
i
began
to
age
say
in
a
century
or
so
the
hair
would
actually
thin
and
turn
white
as
it
did
with
the
natives
it
was
reassuring
to
think
that
once
my
job
was
over
i
could
be
restored
to
normal
it
would
need
another
series
of
operations
and
as
much
time
as
the
original
transformation
but
it
would
be
as
complete
and
scarless
i
be
human
again
i
put
on
the
clothes
they
had
furnished
me
typical
earthly
garments
rough
trousers
and
shirt
of
bleached
plant
fibers
jacket
and
heavy
shoes
of
animal
skin
a
battered
old
hat
of
matted
fur
known
as
felt
there
were
objects
in
my
pockets
the
usual
money
and
papers
a
claspknife
the
pipe
and
tobacco
i
had
trained
myself
to
smoke
and
even
to
like
it
all
fitted
into
my
character
of
a
wandering
outdoors
sort
of
man
an
educated
atavist
i
went
out
of
the
hospital
with
the
long
swinging
stride
of
one
accustomed
to
walking
great
distances
the
center
was
busy
around
me
behind
me
the
hospital
and
laboratories
occupied
a
fairly
small
building
some
eighty
stories
of
stone
and
steel
and
plastic
on
either
side
loomed
the
great
warehouses
military
barracks
officers
apartments
civilian
concessions
filled
with
the
vigorous
life
of
the
starways
behind
the
monstrous
wall
a
mile
to
my
right
was
the
spaceport
and
i
knew
that
a
troopship
had
just
lately
dropped
gravs
from
valgolia
herself
the
center
swarmed
with
young
recruits
off
duty
gaping
at
the
sights
swaggering
in
their
new
uniforms
their
skins
shone
like
polished
copper
in
the
blistering
sunlight
and
their
crests
were
beginning
to
wilt
a
little
all
earth
is
not
the
tropical
jungle
most
valgolians
think
it
is
northern
europe
is
very
pleasant
and
greenland
is
even
a
little
on
the
cold
side
but
it
gets
hot
enough
at
north
america
center
in
midsummer
to
fry
a
shilast
a
cosmopolitan
throng
filled
the
walkways
soldiers
predominated
huge
shy
dacors
little
yangtusans
brawling
gorrads
all
the
manhood
of
valgolia
then
there
were
other
races
vegans
furry
proximans
completely
sirians
and
antarians
they
were
here
as
traders
observers
tourists
whatever
else
of
a
nature
one
can
imagine
i
made
an
way
through
the
crowds
a
sudden
crack
on
the
side
of
my
head
nearly
bowling
me
over
brought
me
to
awareness
i
looked
up
into
the
arrogant
face
of
one
of
the
new
recruits
and
heard
him
rasp
watch
where
you
going
terrie
the
young
blood
in
the
valgolian
military
is
deliberately
trained
to
harshness
even
brutality
for
our
militarism
must
impress
such
backward
colonies
as
earth
it
goes
against
our
grain
but
it
is
necessary
at
another
time
this
might
have
annoyed
me
i
could
have
pulled
rank
on
him
not
only
was
i
an
officer
but
such
treatment
must
be
used
with
intellectual
deliberation
the
occasional
young
garrison
trooper
who
comes
here
with
the
idea
that
the
natives
are
an
inferior
breed
to
be
kicked
around
misses
the
whole
point
of
empire
if
indeed
earth
millions
were
an
inferior
breed
i
would
have
been
here
at
all
valgol
needs
an
economic
empire
but
if
all
we
had
in
mind
was
serfdom
we
be
perfectly
content
with
the
plodding
animal
life
of
deneb
vii
or
a
hundred
other
worlds
i
cringed
appropriately
as
if
i
did
understand
valgolian
universal
and
slunk
past
him
but
it
griped
me
to
be
taken
for
a
terrie
if
i
was
to
become
an
earthling
i
would
at
least
be
a
one
there
were
plenty
of
terries
terrestrials
around
of
course
moving
with
their
odd
combination
of
slavish
deference
toward
valgolians
and
arrogant
superiority
toward
mere
earthlings
they
have
adopted
the
habits
and
customs
of
civilization
entered
the
imperial
service
speak
valgolian
even
with
their
families
many
of
them
shave
their
heads
save
for
a
scalp
lock
in
imitation
of
the
crest
and
wear
white
robes
suggesting
those
of
civil
functionaries
at
home
i
always
felt
a
little
sorry
for
the
class
they
work
and
study
and
toady
to
us
and
try
so
hard
to
be
like
us
it
frustrating
because
that
exactly
what
we
do
want
valgolians
are
valgolians
and
earthlings
are
men
of
earth
well
terries
are
important
to
the
ultimate
aims
of
the
empire
but
not
in
the
way
they
think
they
are
they
serve
as
another
symbol
of
valgolian
conquest
for
earth
to
hate
i
entered
the
administration
building
they
expected
me
there
and
took
me
at
once
to
the
office
of
general
vorka
who
a
general
only
as
far
as
this
solar
system
is
concerned
had
there
been
any
earthlings
around
i
would
have
saluted
to
conform
to
the
show
of
militarism
but
general
vorka
sat
alone
behind
his
desk
and
i
merely
said
hello
coordinator
the
sleeves
of
his
tunic
rolled
up
the
heat
of
north
america
beading
his
forehead
with
sweat
the
big
man
looked
up
at
me
ah
yes
glad
you
finally
prepared
the
sooner
we
get
this
thing
started
he
extended
a
silver
box
sniff
have
a
seat
conru
i
inhaled
gratefully
and
relaxed
the
coordinator
picked
up
a
sheaf
of
papers
on
his
desk
and
leafed
through
them
only
years
old
and
a
captain
already
remarkably
able
a
young
man
like
you
and
your
work
hitherto
has
been
outstanding
that
vegan
business
i
said
yes
i
knew
but
could
he
please
get
down
to
business
you
could
blame
me
for
being
a
bit
anxious
to
begin
disguised
as
i
was
as
an
earthman
i
felt
uncomfortable
embarrassed
almost
at
being
with
my
the
coordinator
shrugged
well
if
you
can
carry
this
business
off
fine
if
you
fail
you
may
die
quite
unpleasantly
that
their
trouble
conru
you
would
be
regarded
as
an
individual
but
as
a
valgolian
did
you
know
that
they
even
make
such
distinctions
among
themselves
i
mean
races
and
and
social
castes
and
the
like
it
keeping
them
divided
and
impotent
conru
it
also
keeping
them
out
of
the
empire
a
shame
i
knew
all
that
of
course
but
i
merely
nodded
coordinator
vorka
was
a
wonderful
man
in
his
field
and
if
he
tended
to
be
on
the
garrulous
side
what
could
i
do
i
said
i
know
that
sir
i
also
know
i
was
picked
for
a
dangerous
job
because
you
thought
i
could
fill
the
role
but
i
still
do
know
exactly
what
the
job
is
coordinator
vorka
smiled
i
afraid
i
ca
tell
you
much
more
than
you
must
already
have
guessed
he
said
the
anarch
movement
here
the
rebels
that
is
is
getting
no
place
primarily
because
of
internal
difficulties
when
members
of
the
same
group
spit
epithets
at
each
other
referring
to
what
they
consider
racial
or
national
distinctions
which
determine
superiority
or
inferiority
the
group
is
bound
to
be
an
insecure
one
such
insecurity
just
does
not
make
for
a
strong
rebellion
conru
they
try
and
we
goad
them
but
dissention
splits
them
constantly
and
their
revolutions
fizzle
out
they
just
ca
unite
against
us
ca
unite
at
all
conru
you
know
how
we
tried
to
educate
them
it
worked
too
to
some
extent
but
you
ca
educate
three
billion
people
who
have
a
whole
cultural
pattern
behind
them
i
winced
three
billion
certainly
earth
is
a
rich
planet
conru
and
a
fairly
crowded
one
at
the
same
time
bickering
is
inevitable
it
a
part
of
their
culture
as
much
as
cooperation
has
been
a
part
of
ours
i
nodded
we
learned
the
hard
way
the
old
valgol
was
a
poor
planet
and
we
had
to
unite
to
conquer
space
or
we
could
not
have
survived
the
coordinator
sniffed
again
at
his
silver
box
of
course
and
trying
to
help
these
people
unite
they
do
have
to
make
the
same
mistakes
we
did
long
ago
they
do
have
to
at
all
get
them
to
hate
us
enough
get
them
to
hate
us
until
all
their
own
clannish
hatreds
do
count
at
all
well
you
know
what
happened
on
samtrak
i
knew
the
samtraks
are
now
the
entrepreneurs
of
the
empire
really
ingenious
traders
but
within
the
memory
of
some
of
our
older
men
they
were
a
they
did
understand
the
meaning
of
empire
any
more
than
earth
does
and
they
never
did
understand
it
until
we
goaded
them
into
open
rebellion
the
very
reverse
of
divide
and
rule
you
might
say
and
it
worked
we
withdrew
trading
privileges
one
by
one
until
they
revolted
successfully
thus
educating
themselves
sociologically
in
only
a
few
generations
vorka
said
the
problem
of
earth
is
not
quite
that
simple
he
leaned
back
made
a
bridge
of
his
fingers
and
peered
across
them
at
me
do
you
know
precisely
what
a
provocateur
job
is
conru
i
said
that
i
did
but
only
in
a
hazy
way
because
until
now
my
work
had
been
pretty
much
restricted
to
social
relations
on
the
more
advanced
empire
planets
however
i
told
him
that
i
did
know
the
idea
was
to
provoke
discontent
and
ultimately
rebellion
the
coordinator
smiled
well
that
just
the
starter
conru
it
a
lot
more
complex
than
that
each
planet
has
its
own
special
problems
the
samtraks
for
example
had
a
whole
background
of
cutthroat
competition
that
was
easy
we
eliminated
that
by
showing
them
what
cutthroat
competition
could
be
like
but
earth
is
different
look
at
it
this
way
they
fight
among
themselves
because
of
their
mythical
distinctions
not
realizing
that
there
are
no
inferior
races
only
more
or
less
advanced
ones
and
that
individuals
must
be
judged
as
individuals
not
as
members
of
groups
nations
or
races
a
planet
like
earth
can
be
immensely
valuable
to
the
empire
but
not
if
it
has
to
be
garrisoned
its
contribution
must
be
voluntary
and
a
difficult
problem
i
said
my
opinion
is
that
we
should
treat
all
exactly
alike
them
to
abandon
their
unrealistic
differences
exactly
the
coordinator
seemed
pleased
but
actually
this
was
pretty
elementary
stuff
we
never
too
rough
on
the
eager
lads
who
come
here
from
valgol
and
kick
the
natives
around
a
bit
we
even
encourage
it
when
the
spirit
of
rebelliousness
dies
down
i
told
him
i
had
met
one
irritating
was
it
conru
humiliating
of
course
these
lads
will
be
reconditioned
to
civilization
when
they
finish
their
military
service
and
prepare
for
more
specialized
work
yes
treating
all
earthlings
alike
is
the
solution
we
put
restrictions
on
these
colonials
they
ca
hold
top
jobs
and
so
on
and
we
encourage
wild
stories
about
brutality
on
our
part
not
enough
to
make
everybody
mad
at
us
or
even
a
majority
the
rumored
tyranny
has
always
happened
to
someone
else
but
there
a
certain
class
of
beings
who
get
fighting
mad
and
that
the
class
we
want
the
leaders
i
chimed
in
the
idealists
brave
intelligent
patriotic
the
kind
who
probably
would
be
a
part
of
this
racial
bickering
anyway
right
said
the
coordinator
we
give
them
the
ammunition
for
their
propaganda
we
doing
it
result
the
leaders
get
mad
races
religions
nationalities
they
hate
us
worse
than
they
hate
each
other
the
way
he
painted
it
i
was
hardly
needed
at
all
i
told
him
that
ideally
that
would
be
the
situation
conru
only
it
does
work
that
way
he
took
out
a
soft
cloth
and
wiped
his
forehead
even
the
leaders
are
too
involved
in
this
myth
of
differences
and
they
concentrate
all
their
efforts
luron
of
course
would
be
the
other
alternative
that
was
a
very
logical
statement
but
sometimes
logic
has
a
way
of
making
you
laugh
and
i
was
laughing
now
luron
considered
itself
our
with
a
few
dozen
allies
on
a
path
of
conquest
luron
thought
it
could
wrest
empire
from
our
hands
well
we
let
them
play
and
each
time
luron
swooped
down
on
one
of
the
more
primitive
planets
we
let
them
for
luron
would
serve
as
well
as
ourselves
in
goading
backward
peoples
to
unite
and
advance
perhaps
luron
as
a
social
entity
grew
wiser
each
time
certainly
the
primitive
colonials
did
luron
had
started
a
chain
reaction
which
threatened
to
overthrow
the
tyranny
of
superstition
on
a
hundred
planets
good
old
luron
our
would
see
the
light
itself
some
day
the
coordinator
shook
his
head
ca
use
luron
here
technologies
are
entirely
too
similar
it
might
shatter
both
planets
and
we
want
that
so
what
do
we
use
you
conru
you
get
in
with
the
revolutionaries
you
make
sure
that
they
want
to
fight
you
i
see
i
told
him
then
i
try
to
stop
it
at
the
last
minute
not
so
soon
that
the
rebellion
does
help
at
all
the
coordinator
put
his
hand
down
flat
nothing
of
the
sort
they
fight
and
they
must
be
defeated
again
and
again
if
necessary
until
they
are
ready
to
succeed
that
will
be
of
course
when
they
are
against
us
i
stood
up
i
understand
he
waved
me
back
into
the
chair
you
be
lucky
to
understand
it
by
the
time
you
finished
with
this
assignment
and
transferred
to
another
that
is
if
you
come
out
of
this
one
alive
i
smiled
a
bit
sheepishly
and
told
him
to
go
ahead
we
have
some
influence
in
the
underground
movement
as
you
might
logically
expect
the
leader
is
a
man
we
worked
very
hard
to
have
elected
a
member
of
one
of
the
despised
races
i
guessed
the
best
we
could
do
at
this
point
was
to
help
elect
someone
from
a
minority
of
the
dominant
white
race
the
leader
name
is
levinsohn
he
is
of
the
white
known
as
jews
how
well
is
this
levinsohn
accepted
by
the
movement
considerable
resistance
and
hostility
the
coordinator
said
to
be
expected
however
we
made
sure
that
there
is
no
other
organization
the
can
join
so
they
have
to
follow
him
or
quit
he
able
all
right
one
of
the
most
able
men
they
have
which
helps
our
aims
even
those
who
discriminate
against
jews
reluctantly
admire
him
he
moved
the
headquarters
of
the
movement
out
into
space
and
the
man
so
brilliant
that
we
do
even
know
where
we
find
out
mainly
through
you
i
hope
but
that
is
the
important
thing
what
is
i
asked
baffled
to
report
on
the
unification
of
earth
it
possible
that
the
anarch
movement
can
achieve
it
under
levinsohn
in
that
case
we
make
sure
they
win
or
think
they
win
and
will
gladly
sign
a
treaty
giving
earth
equal
planetary
status
in
the
empire
and
if
unity
has
been
achieved
we
simply
crush
this
rebellion
and
make
them
start
all
over
again
they
have
learned
some
degree
of
unity
from
this
revolt
and
so
the
next
one
will
be
more
successful
he
stood
up
and
i
got
out
of
my
chair
to
face
him
that
for
the
future
though
we
work
out
our
plans
from
the
results
of
this
campaign
but
is
there
a
lot
of
danger
in
the
policy
of
fomenting
rebellion
against
us
i
asked
he
lifted
his
shoulders
evolution
is
always
painful
forced
evolution
even
more
so
yes
there
are
great
dangers
but
advance
information
from
you
and
other
agents
can
reduce
the
risk
it
a
chance
we
must
take
conru
conrad
i
corrected
him
smiling
plain
conrad
haugen
of
earth
ii
a
few
days
later
i
left
north
america
center
and
in
spite
of
the
ominous
need
to
hurry
my
eastward
journey
was
a
ramble
the
anarchs
would
be
sure
to
check
my
movements
as
far
back
as
they
could
and
my
story
had
better
ring
true
for
the
present
i
must
my
role
a
vagabond
the
city
was
soon
behind
me
it
was
far
from
other
settlement
it
is
good
policy
to
keep
the
centers
rather
isolated
and
we
could
always
contact
our
garrisons
in
native
towns
quickly
enough
before
long
i
was
alone
in
the
mountains
i
liked
that
part
of
the
trip
the
rockies
are
huge
and
serene
a
fresh
cold
wind
blows
from
their
peaks
and
roars
in
the
pines
brawling
rivers
foam
through
their
dales
and
canyons
it
is
a
big
landscape
clean
and
strong
and
lonely
it
speaks
with
silence
i
hitched
a
ride
for
some
hundreds
of
miles
with
one
of
the
great
that
dominate
the
western
highways
the
driver
was
earthling
and
though
he
complained
much
about
the
valgolian
tyranny
he
looked
healthy
secure
i
thought
of
the
wars
which
had
been
laying
the
planet
waste
the
social
ruin
and
economic
collapse
which
the
empire
had
mended
and
wondered
if
terra
would
ever
be
fit
to
rule
itself
i
came
out
of
the
enormous
mountainlands
into
the
sage
plains
of
nevada
for
a
few
days
i
worked
at
a
native
ranch
listening
to
the
talk
and
keeping
my
mouth
shut
yes
there
was
discontent
their
taxes
are
killing
me
said
the
owner
what
the
hell
incentive
do
i
have
to
produce
if
they
take
it
away
from
me
i
nodded
but
thought
kind
was
paying
more
taxes
in
the
old
days
and
had
less
to
show
for
it
here
you
get
your
money
back
in
public
works
and
universal
security
no
one
on
earth
is
cold
or
hungry
can
you
only
produce
for
your
own
private
gain
earthling
the
labor
draft
got
my
kid
the
other
day
said
the
foreman
spend
two
good
years
of
his
life
working
for
them
and
come
back
hopheaded
about
the
good
o
the
empire
was
a
i
thought
millions
of
earthlings
clamored
for
work
or
spent
years
fighting
their
wars
gave
their
youth
to
a
god
of
battle
who
only
clamored
for
more
blood
and
how
can
we
have
a
stable
society
without
educating
its
members
to
respect
it
i
another
kid
said
the
female
cook
two
ai
really
enough
they
good
boys
but
i
want
a
girl
too
only
the
eridanian
law
says
if
i
go
over
my
quota
if
i
have
one
more
they
sterilize
me
and
they
do
it
the
meddling
devils
billion
earthlings
are
all
the
solar
system
can
hold
under
decent
standards
of
living
without
exhausting
what
natural
resources
their
own
culture
left
i
thought
are
ready
to
permit
emigration
our
own
people
must
come
first
but
these
beings
can
live
well
here
only
now
that
we
eliminated
famine
plague
and
war
they
breed
beyond
reason
breed
till
all
the
old
evils
came
back
to
throttle
them
if
we
did
have
strict
population
yeah
said
her
husband
bitterly
they
never
even
let
my
cousin
have
kids
sterilized
him
damn
near
right
after
he
was
born
he
a
moron
or
carries
hemophilia
or
has
some
other
hereditary
i
thought
they
see
we
doing
it
for
their
own
good
it
costs
us
fantastically
in
money
and
trouble
but
the
goal
is
a
level
of
health
and
sanity
such
as
this
race
never
in
its
history
dreamed
they
stranglin
faith
muttered
someone
else
in
the
empire
may
worship
as
he
chooses
but
should
permission
be
granted
to
preach
demonstrable
falsehoods
archaic
superstitions
or
antisocial
nonsense
the
old
free
earth
was
not
noted
for
we
want
to
be
free
free
for
what
to
loose
the
thousand
earthly
races
and
creeds
and
nationalisms
on
each
other
and
on
the
galaxy
to
wallow
in
barbarism
and
slaughter
and
misery
as
before
we
came
to
let
our
works
and
culture
be
thrown
in
the
dust
the
labor
of
a
century
be
demolished
not
because
it
is
good
or
bad
but
simply
because
it
is
valgolian
epsilon
eridanian
we
be
free
not
too
long
to
wait
either
up
to
nobody
else
but
you
i
could
get
much
specific
information
but
then
i
had
expected
to
i
collected
my
pay
and
drifted
on
eastward
talking
to
people
of
all
classes
farmers
mechanics
shopowners
tramps
and
such
data
as
i
gathered
tallied
with
those
of
intelligence
about
per
cent
of
the
population
in
north
america
at
least
it
was
higher
in
the
orient
and
africa
was
satisfied
with
the
imperium
felt
they
were
better
off
than
they
would
have
been
in
the
old
days
the
eridanians
are
pretty
decent
on
the
whole
some
of
come
in
here
and
act
nice
and
human
as
you
please
some
fifty
per
cent
was
vaguely
dissatisfied
wanted
freedom
without
troubling
to
define
the
term
did
like
the
taxes
or
the
labor
draft
or
the
enforced
disarmament
or
the
legal
and
social
superiority
of
valgolians
or
some
such
thing
had
perhaps
suffered
in
the
reconquest
but
this
group
constituted
no
real
threat
it
would
tend
to
be
passive
whatever
happened
its
greatest
contribution
would
be
sporadic
rioting
the
remaining
per
cent
was
bitter
waiting
its
chance
muttering
of
a
day
of
revenge
and
some
portion
of
this
segment
was
spreading
propaganda
secretly
manufacturing
and
distributing
weapons
engaging
in
clandestine
military
drill
and
maintaining
contact
with
the
shadowy
legion
of
freedom
childish
melodramatic
name
but
it
had
been
well
chosen
to
appeal
to
a
certain
type
of
mind
the
real
organized
core
of
the
anarch
movement
was
highly
efficient
in
those
months
i
spent
wandering
and
waiting
its
activities
mounted
almost
daily
the
illegal
radio
carried
unending
programs
propaganda
fabricated
stories
of
valgolian
brutality
i
knew
from
personal
experience
that
some
were
false
and
i
knew
the
whole
imperial
system
well
enough
to
spot
most
of
the
rest
at
least
partly
invented
i
realized
we
trace
such
a
setup
of
mobile
and
coordinated
units
and
jamming
would
have
been
poor
tactics
but
even
so
day
is
coming
earthmen
free
men
be
ready
to
throw
off
your
shackles
stand
by
for
freedom
i
stuck
to
my
role
when
autumn
came
i
drifted
into
one
of
the
native
cities
new
chicago
a
warren
of
buildings
near
the
remains
of
the
old
settlement
the
same
gigantic
slum
that
its
predecessor
had
been
i
got
a
room
in
a
cheap
hotel
and
a
job
in
a
steel
mill
i
was
conrad
haugen
assigned
to
a
spaceship
by
the
labor
draft
and
liking
it
well
enough
to
when
my
term
was
up
i
had
wandered
through
much
of
the
empire
and
had
had
a
great
deal
of
contact
with
eridanians
but
was
most
emphatically
not
a
terrie
in
fact
i
thought
it
would
be
well
if
the
redskin
yoke
could
be
thrown
off
both
because
of
liberty
and
the
good
pickings
to
be
had
in
the
galaxy
if
the
empire
should
collapse
i
had
risen
to
second
mate
on
an
interstellar
tramp
but
could
get
no
further
because
of
the
law
that
the
two
highest
officers
must
be
valgolian
that
had
embittered
me
and
i
returned
to
earth
and
looking
for
trouble
i
found
it
with
officer
training
and
the
strength
due
to
a
home
planet
with
a
gravity
half
again
that
of
earth
i
had
no
difficulty
at
all
becoming
a
foreman
there
was
a
big
fellow
named
mike
riley
who
thought
he
was
entitled
to
the
job
we
settled
it
behind
a
shed
with
the
workmen
looking
on
and
i
beat
him
unconscious
as
fast
as
possible
the
raw
sweating
savagery
of
it
made
me
feel
ill
inside
this
among
the
after
that
i
was
one
of
the
boys
and
riley
was
my
best
friend
we
went
out
together
wenching
and
drinking
raising
hell
in
the
cold
dirty
canyons
of
steel
and
stone
which
the
natives
called
streets
valgolia
the
clean
bare
windswept
heights
of
your
mountains
soughing
trees
and
thunderous
waters
and
maara
waiting
for
me
to
come
home
riley
often
proposed
that
we
find
an
eridanian
and
beat
him
to
death
and
i
would
agree
hiccupping
because
i
knew
they
did
go
alone
into
native
quarters
any
more
i
sat
in
the
smoky
reek
of
the
bars
half
deafened
by
the
clatter
and
raucousness
called
music
trying
not
to
think
of
a
certain
quiet
tavern
amid
the
gardens
of
kalariho
and
sobbed
the
bitterness
of
conrad
haugen
into
my
beer
dirty
redskins
i
muttered
dirty
stinking
sons
of
bitches
them
and
their
empire
why
if
hadn
been
f
their
laws
i
be
skipper
o
my
own
ship
now
i
knew
that
slob
o
a
captain
but
he
was
born
eridanian
god
to
get
my
hands
on
his
throat
riley
nodded
through
the
haze
of
smoke
i
saw
that
his
eyes
were
narrowed
he
was
drunk
when
he
did
want
to
be
and
at
times
like
this
he
was
suddenly
as
sober
as
i
was
and
that
in
spite
of
not
having
a
valgolian
liver
i
bided
my
time
not
too
obviously
anxious
to
contact
the
legion
i
just
thought
they
were
swell
fellows
the
only
brave
men
left
in
the
rotten
stinking
empire
i
sure
be
on
their
side
when
the
day
came
i
worked
in
the
mill
and
when
out
with
the
boys
lamented
the
fact
that
we
were
really
producing
for
the
damned
eridanians
we
could
even
keep
the
products
of
our
own
sweat
i
was
obtrusive
about
it
of
course
most
of
the
time
we
were
just
boozing
but
when
the
talk
came
to
the
empire
i
made
it
clear
just
where
i
stood
the
winter
went
i
continued
the
dreary
round
of
days
wondering
how
long
it
would
take
wondering
how
much
time
was
left
if
the
legion
was
at
all
interested
they
would
be
checking
my
background
right
now
let
them
there
would
be
much
to
check
but
what
there
was
had
been
carefully
manufactured
by
the
experts
of
the
intelligence
service
riley
came
into
my
room
one
evening
his
face
was
tight
and
he
plunged
to
business
con
do
you
really
mean
all
you
said
about
the
empire
why
of
course
i
i
glanced
out
the
window
as
if
expecting
to
see
a
spy
if
there
were
any
i
knew
he
would
be
native
the
empire
just
does
have
enough
men
for
a
secret
police
even
if
we
wanted
to
indulge
in
that
sort
of
historically
ineffective
control
you
like
to
fight
them
like
really
to
help
the
legion
of
freedom
when
they
strike
you
bet
your
obscenity
life
i
snarled
when
they
land
on
earth
i
get
a
gun
somewhere
and
be
right
there
in
the
middle
of
the
battle
with
them
yeah
riley
puffed
a
cigaret
for
a
while
then
he
said
look
i
ca
tell
you
much
i
taking
a
chance
just
telling
you
this
it
could
mean
my
life
if
you
passed
it
on
to
the
eridanians
i
wo
his
eyes
were
bleak
you
damn
well
better
not
if
you
caught
at
that
he
drew
a
finger
sharply
across
his
throat
quit
talking
like
a
stereo
i
bristled
if
you
got
something
to
tell
me
let
have
it
otherwise
get
out
yeah
sure
we
checked
up
on
you
con
and
we
think
you
as
good
a
prospect
as
we
ever
came
across
if
you
want
to
fight
the
eridanians
now
the
now
here
your
chance
my
god
you
know
i
do
but
who
i
ca
tell
you
a
thing
but
if
you
really
want
to
join
memorize
this
riley
gave
me
a
small
card
on
which
was
written
a
name
and
address
destroy
it
thoroughly
then
quit
at
the
mill
and
drift
to
this
other
place
as
if
you
gotten
tired
of
your
work
and
wanted
to
hit
the
road
again
take
your
time
do
make
a
beeline
for
it
when
you
do
arrive
they
take
care
of
you
i
nodded
grimly
i
do
it
mike
and
thanks
just
my
job
he
smiled
relaxing
and
pulled
a
flask
from
his
overcoat
okay
con
that
that
we
better
not
go
out
to
drink
after
this
but
nothing
to
stop
us
from
getting
stinko
here
iii
spring
had
come
and
almost
gone
when
i
wandered
into
the
little
maine
town
which
was
my
destination
it
lay
out
of
the
way
with
forested
hills
behind
it
and
the
sea
at
its
foot
most
of
the
houses
were
old
solidly
built
almost
like
parts
of
the
land
and
the
inhabitants
were
steady
folk
fishermen
and
artisans
and
the
like
settled
here
and
at
home
with
the
darkling
woods
and
the
restless
sea
and
the
high
windy
sky
i
walked
down
a
narrow
street
with
a
cool
salt
breeze
ruffling
my
hair
and
decided
that
i
liked
portsboro
it
reminded
me
of
my
own
home
twenty
away
on
the
wide
beaches
of
kealvigh
i
made
my
way
to
nat
hawkins
store
and
asked
for
work
like
any
drifter
but
when
we
were
alone
in
the
back
room
i
told
him
conrad
haugen
mike
riley
said
you
be
looking
for
me
he
nodded
calmly
i
been
expecting
you
you
can
work
here
a
few
days
sleep
at
my
house
and
we
run
the
tests
after
dark
he
was
old
for
an
earthling
well
over
sixty
with
white
hair
and
lined
leathery
face
but
his
blue
eyes
were
as
keen
and
steady
his
gnarled
hands
as
strong
and
sure
as
those
of
any
young
man
he
spoke
softly
and
steadily
around
the
pipe
which
rarely
left
his
mouth
and
there
was
a
serenity
in
him
which
i
could
hardly
associate
with
anarch
fanaticism
but
the
first
night
he
led
me
into
his
cellar
and
through
a
trapdoor
to
a
room
below
and
there
he
had
a
complete
psychological
laboratory
i
gaped
at
the
gleaming
apparatus
how
off
earth
it
came
piece
by
piece
much
of
it
from
epsilon
eridani
itself
he
smiled
there
is
after
all
no
ban
on
humans
owning
such
material
but
to
play
safe
we
spread
the
purchases
over
several
years
and
made
them
in
the
names
of
many
people
but
you
i
took
a
degree
in
psychiatry
once
i
can
handle
this
he
could
he
put
me
through
the
mill
in
the
next
few
nights
intelligence
tests
psychometry
encephalography
narcosis
everything
his
machines
and
his
skill
could
cover
he
did
not
find
out
anything
we
had
meant
to
be
found
out
the
service
had
ways
of
guarding
its
agents
with
but
he
got
a
very
thorough
picture
of
conrad
haugen
in
the
end
he
said
still
calmly
this
is
amazing
you
have
an
iq
well
over
the
borderline
of
genius
an
astonishing
variety
of
assorted
knowledge
about
the
empire
and
about
technical
subjects
and
an
implacable
hatred
of
eridanian
rule
based
on
personal
pique
and
containing
elements
but
no
less
firm
for
that
you
out
for
yourself
but
you
stand
by
your
comrades
and
your
cause
never
hoped
for
more
recruits
of
your
caliber
when
do
i
start
i
asked
impatiently
easy
easy
he
smiled
there
time
we
waited
fifty
years
we
can
wait
a
while
longer
he
riffled
through
the
dossier
actually
the
difficulty
is
where
to
assign
you
a
man
who
knows
astrogation
the
use
of
weapons
and
machines
and
the
empire
who
is
physically
strong
as
a
bull
can
lead
men
and
has
a
dozen
other
accomplishments
really
seems
wasted
on
any
single
job
i
not
sure
but
i
think
you
do
best
as
a
roving
agent
operating
between
main
base
and
the
planets
where
we
have
cells
and
helping
with
the
work
at
the
base
when
there
my
heart
fairly
leaped
into
my
throat
this
was
more
than
had
dared
hope
for
i
think
said
nat
hawkins
you
better
just
drop
out
of
sight
now
go
to
hood
island
and
stay
there
till
the
spaceship
comes
next
time
you
can
spend
the
interval
profitably
resting
and
getting
a
little
fattened
up
you
look
half
starved
and
barbara
can
tell
you
about
the
legion
his
leather
face
smiled
itself
into
a
mesh
of
fine
wrinkles
i
think
you
deserve
that
conrad
and
so
does
barbara
mentally
i
shrugged
my
stay
in
new
chicago
had
pretty
well
convinced
me
that
all
earthling
females
were
sluts
and
what
of
it
the
following
night
hawkins
and
i
rowed
out
to
hood
island
it
lay
about
a
mile
offshore
a
wooded
rocky
piece
of
land
on
which
a
surf
boomed
and
rattled
the
place
had
belonged
to
the
hood
family
since
the
first
settlements
here
but
barbara
was
the
last
of
them
hawkins
voice
came
softly
to
me
above
the
crash
of
surf
the
surge
of
waves
and
windy
roar
of
trees
as
we
neared
the
dock
she
has
more
reason
than
most
to
hate
the
eridanians
the
hoods
used
to
be
great
people
around
here
they
were
just
about
ruined
when
the
redskins
first
came
space
bombardment
wiped
out
their
holdings
but
they
made
a
new
start
then
her
grandfather
and
all
his
brothers
were
killed
in
the
revolt
ten
years
ago
her
father
was
caught
while
trying
to
hijack
a
jetload
of
guns
and
her
mother
did
live
long
after
that
then
her
brother
was
drafted
into
a
road
crew
and
reported
killed
in
an
accident
since
then
she
has
lived
for
much
except
the
legion
i
do
blame
her
i
said
my
voice
was
a
little
tight
for
indeed
i
did
but
somebody
has
to
suffer
civilization
has
a
heavy
price
i
could
help
adding
but
the
empire
lately
begun
paying
pensions
to
cases
like
that
i
know
she
draws
hers
too
and
uses
it
for
the
legion
of
course
was
the
reason
for
the
the
boat
bumped
against
the
dock
hawkins
threw
the
painter
up
to
the
man
who
suddenly
emerged
from
the
shadow
i
saw
the
cold
silver
moonlight
gleam
off
the
rifle
in
his
hand
you
know
me
eb
said
hawkins
this
here
con
haugen
i
slipped
you
the
word
about
him
glad
to
know
you
con
eb
horny
palm
clasped
mine
i
liked
his
looks
as
i
did
those
of
most
of
the
legionnaires
they
were
altogether
different
from
the
barbarians
who
were
all
the
rebels
i
seen
before
they
had
a
great
load
of
ignorance
to
drag
with
them
we
went
up
a
garden
path
to
a
rambling
stone
house
inside
it
was
long
and
low
and
filled
with
the
memoirs
of
more
gracious
days
art
and
fine
furniture
books
lining
the
walls
a
fire
crackling
ruddily
in
the
living
room
barbara
hood
conrad
haugen
almost
i
gaped
at
her
i
had
expected
some
gaunt
dowdy
fanatic
a
little
mad
perhaps
but
she
was
well
she
was
tall
and
supple
and
clad
in
a
long
evening
gown
that
shimmered
against
her
white
skin
she
was
not
conventionally
pretty
her
face
was
too
strong
for
all
of
its
fine
lines
but
she
had
huge
blue
eyes
and
a
wide
soft
mouth
and
a
stubborn
chin
the
light
glowed
gold
on
the
hair
that
tumbled
to
her
shoulders
i
blurted
something
out
and
she
smiled
with
a
curious
little
twist
that
somehow
caught
in
me
and
said
merely
hello
conrad
glad
to
be
here
i
mumbled
the
spaceship
should
arrive
in
a
month
or
so
she
went
on
teach
you
as
much
as
i
can
in
that
time
and
you
better
get
your
own
special
knowledge
onto
a
record
wire
just
in
case
i
understand
been
in
the
vegan
system
for
instance
which
nobody
else
in
the
legion
knows
very
much
about
her
tone
was
cool
and
but
with
an
underlying
warmth
it
was
like
the
sea
wind
which
blew
over
the
islands
and
as
reviving
i
recovered
myself
and
helped
mix
some
drinks
the
rest
of
the
evening
passed
very
pleasantly
later
a
servant
showed
me
to
my
room
a
big
one
overlooking
the
water
i
lay
for
a
while
listening
to
the
waves
thinking
drowsily
how
rebellion
when
its
motives
were
honest
drew
in
the
best
natives
of
any
world
and
presently
i
fell
asleep
the
month
passed
all
too
quickly
and
agreeably
i
learned
things
which
intelligence
had
spent
the
last
three
years
trying
to
find
out
and
dared
not
attempt
to
transmit
the
information
that
was
maddening
though
i
knew
there
was
time
but
otherwise
i
puttered
about
the
place
there
were
only
three
servants
old
family
retainers
who
had
also
joined
the
anarchs
they
had
little
modern
machinery
and
of
course
earthlings
were
allowed
robots
so
there
was
need
for
an
extra
man
or
two
i
cut
wood
and
repaired
the
roof
and
painted
the
boathouse
spaded
the
garden
and
cleared
out
brush
and
set
up
a
new
picket
fence
it
was
good
to
use
my
hands
and
muscles
again
and
then
barbara
was
around
to
help
with
most
of
what
i
did
in
jeans
and
jersey
the
sun
ablaze
on
her
hair
laughing
at
my
clumsy
jokes
or
frowning
over
some
tough
bit
of
work
she
was
another
being
than
the
cool
lovely
woman
who
talked
books
and
music
and
history
with
me
in
the
evenings
or
the
crisp
bitter
anarch
who
spat
facts
and
figures
at
me
like
an
angry
machine
and
yet
they
were
all
her
i
remembered
ydis
who
was
dead
and
the
old
pain
stirred
again
but
barbara
was
alive
she
was
more
alive
to
me
than
most
of
valgolia
i
make
no
apologies
for
my
feelings
i
had
been
away
from
anything
resembling
home
for
some
two
years
now
but
i
was
careful
to
remain
merely
friendly
with
barbara
she
did
know
a
great
deal
about
the
rebel
movement
no
one
agent
on
earth
did
but
her
knowledge
was
still
considerable
there
was
a
fortified
base
somewhere
out
in
space
built
up
over
a
period
of
four
years
with
the
help
of
certain
unnamed
elements
or
planets
outside
the
empire
i
suspected
several
rival
states
of
that
weapons
of
all
kinds
were
manufactured
there
in
quantities
sufficient
to
arm
the
million
or
so
rebels
of
the
regular
force
the
twenty
million
or
so
in
the
solar
system
and
elsewhere
who
held
secret
drills
and
conducted
terrorist
activities
and
the
many
millions
more
who
were
expected
to
rise
spontaneously
when
the
rebel
fleet
struck
there
was
close
coordination
and
a
central
command
at
main
base
for
the
undergrounds
of
all
dissatisfied
planets
a
new
and
formidable
feature
which
had
not
been
present
in
the
earlier
uprisings
there
were
rumors
of
a
new
and
terrible
weapon
being
developed
in
any
case
the
plan
was
to
assault
epsilon
eridani
itself
simultaneously
with
the
uprisings
in
the
colonies
so
that
the
imperial
fleet
would
be
recalled
to
defend
the
mother
world
the
anarchs
hoped
to
blast
valgolia
to
ruin
in
a
few
swift
blows
and
expected
that
the
empire
jealous
neighbors
would
sweep
in
to
complete
the
wreckage
this
gentle
girl
spoke
of
the
smashing
of
worlds
the
blasting
of
helpless
humans
and
the
destruction
of
a
culture
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
insect
extermination
have
you
ever
thought
i
asked
casually
once
that
the
juranians
and
the
slighs
and
our
other
hypothetical
allies
may
not
respect
the
integrity
of
sol
any
more
than
the
eridanians
do
we
can
handle
them
she
answered
confidently
oh
it
wo
be
easy
that
time
of
transition
but
we
be
free
and
what
then
i
went
on
i
do
want
to
be
defeatist
barbara
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
the
eridanians
did
conquer
all
mankind
at
a
single
swoop
when
they
invented
the
interstellar
engine
and
arrived
here
man
was
tearing
the
solar
system
apart
in
a
war
between
that
was
rapidly
reducing
him
to
barbarism
the
redskins
traded
for
a
while
sold
arms
some
of
their
adventurers
took
sides
in
the
conflict
the
government
stepped
in
to
protect
eridanian
citizens
and
investments
the
side
which
the
eridanians
helped
won
the
war
then
found
its
allies
were
running
things
and
tried
to
revolt
against
the
protectorate
and
without
really
meaning
to
the
strangers
were
conquering
and
ruling
earth
but
the
different
factions
of
man
still
hate
each
other
guts
there
are
still
capitalists
and
communists
blacks
whites
and
browns
hindus
and
moslems
germans
and
frenchmen
city
people
and
country
people
a
million
petty
divisions
there
be
civil
war
as
soon
as
the
eridanians
are
gone
some
perhaps
she
agreed
but
i
think
it
can
be
handled
if
we
have
to
have
civil
wars
well
let
get
them
over
with
and
live
as
free
men
personally
i
could
see
nothing
in
the
sort
of
military
dictatorship
that
would
inevitably
arise
which
was
preferable
to
an
alien
firm
but
just
rule
that
insured
stability
and
a
reasonable
degree
of
individual
liberty
but
i
did
say
that
aloud
another
time
we
talked
of
the
of
earth
barbara
was
of
course
venomous
about
it
we
were
rich
once
she
said
all
earth
was
we
have
one
of
the
richest
planets
in
the
galaxy
but
because
their
own
world
is
poor
the
redskins
have
to
take
the
natural
resources
of
their
conquests
earth
is
a
granary
and
a
lumberyard
for
valgolia
and
the
iron
of
mars
and
the
petrolite
of
venus
go
back
to
their
industry
what
few
factories
they
allow
us
they
take
their
fat
percentage
of
the
product
certainly
they
made
us
economically
dependent
i
said
and
their
standard
of
living
is
undoubtedly
higher
than
ours
but
ours
has
on
the
whole
gone
up
since
the
conquest
we
eat
better
healthier
we
are
burdened
with
the
cost
of
past
and
present
and
future
wars
our
natural
resources
are
being
squandered
the
forests
and
watersheds
and
farmlands
we
ruined
are
coming
back
under
eridanian
supervision
she
gave
me
an
odd
look
i
thought
you
did
like
the
empire
i
do
i
growled
i
do
want
to
be
held
back
just
because
but
i
known
enough
reddies
personally
so
that
i
try
to
be
fair
it
all
right
with
me
she
said
i
can
see
your
point
intellectually
though
i
ca
really
it
but
not
many
of
the
people
will
out
at
main
base
free
men
i
muttered
sardonically
we
went
fishing
and
swam
in
the
tumbling
surf
and
stretched
lazily
on
the
beach
with
the
sun
pouring
over
us
or
we
might
go
tramping
off
into
the
woods
on
a
picnic
to
run
laughing
back
when
a
sudden
rain
rushed
out
of
the
sky
and
afterward
sit
with
beer
and
cheese
sandwiches
listening
to
a
wire
of
beethoven
or
mozart
or
tchaikovsky
the
old
earthlings
could
write
music
if
they
did
nothing
else
and
to
the
rain
shouting
on
the
roof
we
might
have
a
little
highly
illegal
target
practice
or
a
game
of
chess
or
long
conversations
which
wandered
off
every
which
way
i
began
to
have
a
sneaking
hope
that
the
spaceship
would
be
delayed
we
went
out
one
day
in
barbara
little
catboat
the
waves
danced
around
us
chuckling
against
the
hull
glittering
with
sunlight
and
the
sail
was
like
a
snow
mountain
against
the
sky
for
a
while
we
chatted
dreamily
ate
our
lunch
threw
the
scraps
to
the
hovering
gulls
then
barbara
fell
silent
what
the
matter
i
asked
oh
nothing
touch
of
maybe
she
smiled
at
me
you
know
con
you
do
really
belong
in
the
legion
how
so
i
raised
my
eyebrows
you
well
you
so
darned
honest
so
really
decent
under
that
carefully
rough
surface
so
reasonable
you
never
make
a
good
fanatic
i
looked
away
from
her
the
bright
day
seemed
suddenly
to
darken
iv
spaceships
from
main
base
had
little
trouble
coming
to
earth
with
their
cargoes
of
guns
propaganda
instructors
and
whatever
else
the
rebels
on
the
planet
needed
they
would
take
up
an
orbit
just
beyond
the
atmosphere
and
send
boats
to
the
surface
after
dark
there
was
little
danger
of
their
being
detected
if
they
took
the
usual
precautions
a
world
is
simply
too
big
to
blockade
completely
ours
dropped
on
noiseless
gravitic
beams
into
the
nighted
island
woods
we
had
been
watching
for
it
the
last
few
days
and
now
eb
came
running
to
tell
us
it
was
here
the
pilot
followed
after
him
harry
kane
conrad
haugen
barbara
introduced
us
i
shook
hands
sizing
him
up
he
was
tall
for
an
earthling
almost
as
big
as
i
with
young
features
he
wore
some
approximation
of
a
uniform
tunic
and
breeches
peaked
cap
captain
insignia
which
gave
him
a
rather
dashing
look
it
have
made
any
difference
to
me
of
course
but
i
did
like
the
way
he
smiled
at
barbara
she
explained
my
presence
and
he
nodded
eagerly
glad
to
have
you
haugen
we
need
good
men
and
badly
then
to
her
get
hawkins
you
and
he
are
recalled
to
main
base
what
but
a
dark
exultation
lit
his
face
the
time
for
action
is
near
very
near
we
pulling
all
our
best
agents
off
the
planets
they
can
work
more
effectively
with
the
fleet
now
i
tried
to
look
as
savagely
gleeful
as
they
but
inwardly
i
groaned
how
in
all
the
hells
was
i
going
to
contact
vorka
if
i
were
stranded
out
in
space
when
the
fleet
got
under
way
no
they
must
have
an
ultrabeam
i
manage
somehow
to
call
on
that
even
if
they
caught
me
at
it
we
sent
eb
in
a
boat
to
get
hawkins
while
barbara
and
i
packed
a
few
necessities
kane
paced
back
and
forth
spilling
out
the
news
from
main
base
word
of
mighty
forces
gathering
rumors
of
help
promised
from
outside
it
was
like
the
thunder
which
mutters
just
before
a
gale
presently
hawkins
arrived
the
old
man
calm
was
undisturbed
he
puffed
his
pipe
and
said
quietly
i
called
up
my
housekeeper
told
her
my
sister
in
california
was
suddenly
taken
sick
and
i
was
leaving
at
once
for
the
transcontinental
jetport
just
to
account
for
disappearing
you
know
there
are
any
eridanians
or
terries
hereabouts
but
we
desperate
characters
he
grinned
briefly
be
too
careful
brought
my
equipment
along
of
course
i
suppose
they
want
me
to
do
psychometry
on
fleet
personnel
something
on
that
order
i
do
know
we
made
our
way
through
a
fine
drizzle
of
rain
to
the
little
torpedo
of
the
spaceboat
i
looked
around
into
the
misty
dark
and
breathed
a
deep
lungful
of
the
cool
wet
wind
and
i
saw
that
barbara
was
doing
the
same
she
smiled
up
at
me
through
the
night
and
the
thin
sad
rain
earth
is
a
beautiful
world
con
she
whispered
i
wonder
if
we
ever
see
it
again
i
squeezed
her
hand
silently
and
we
crowded
into
the
boat
kane
made
a
smooth
takeoff
in
minutes
we
were
beyond
the
atmosphere
earth
was
a
great
glowing
shield
of
cloudy
blue
behind
us
and
the
stars
were
bitter
bright
against
darkness
we
sent
a
coded
call
signal
and
got
a
directional
beam
from
the
ship
before
long
we
were
approaching
it
i
studied
the
lean
black
cruiser
she
seemed
to
be
of
about
the
same
design
as
the
old
solarian
interplanetary
ships
modified
somewhat
to
accommodate
the
star
drive
apparently
she
was
one
of
those
built
at
main
base
her
bow
guns
were
dark
shadows
against
the
clotted
cold
silver
of
the
milky
way
i
thought
of
the
death
and
the
ruin
which
could
flame
from
them
i
thought
of
the
hell
she
and
her
kind
bore
atomic
bombs
radiodust
bombs
chemical
bombs
disease
bombs
gravity
snatchers
needle
beams
disintegrative
shells
darkness
and
doom
and
the
new
barbarism
and
felt
a
stiffening
within
me
fostering
this
murderousness
was
a
frightful
risk
the
main
defense
against
it
was
intelligence
and
that
depended
on
agents
like
myself
perhaps
myself
the
crew
was
rather
small
no
battles
being
anticipated
but
they
were
well
disciplined
uniformed
and
trained
a
new
solarian
army
built
up
from
the
fragments
of
the
old
the
captain
was
a
stiff
gray
german
who
had
been
a
leader
in
the
earlier
revolt
and
since
fled
to
space
but
most
of
the
officers
such
as
kane
were
young
and
violent
in
their
eagerness
we
orbited
around
the
planet
for
another
day
or
so
till
all
the
boats
had
returned
there
was
tension
in
the
ship
if
the
imperial
navy
should
happen
to
spot
us
we
were
done
off
duty
we
would
sit
around
talking
smoking
playing
games
with
little
concentration
kane
spent
most
of
his
free
hours
with
barbara
they
had
much
to
talk
about
i
swallowed
a
certain
irrational
jealousy
and
wandered
around
cautiously
pumping
as
many
men
as
i
could
we
got
under
way
at
last
by
this
time
i
had
learned
that
main
base
was
a
planet
but
no
more
only
the
highest
leadership
of
the
legion
knew
its
location
and
they
were
pledged
to
swallow
the
poison
they
always
carried
if
there
seemed
to
be
any
danger
of
capture
for
several
days
by
the
clocks
we
ran
outward
roughly
toward
draco
our
velocity
was
not
revealed
and
the
slow
shift
in
the
outside
view
did
help
much
i
guess
that
we
had
come
perhaps
ten
parsecs
but
that
was
only
a
guess
main
base
stand
when
the
call
rang
hollowly
down
the
ship
passageways
i
could
feel
the
weariness
and
tautness
easing
i
could
see
homecoming
in
the
faces
around
me
i
stole
a
glance
at
barbara
her
eyes
were
wide
and
her
lips
parted
she
looked
ahead
as
if
to
stare
through
the
metal
walls
she
had
never
been
here
either
here
where
all
her
dreams
came
home
so
we
landed
we
slipped
down
out
of
the
dark
and
the
cold
and
the
void
and
i
heard
the
rattle
and
groan
of
metal
easing
into
place
when
the
ship
interior
was
turned
off
i
felt
a
sudden
heaviness
this
world
had
almost
a
quarter
again
the
pull
of
earth
but
people
got
used
to
that
quickly
enough
it
was
the
landscape
which
was
hard
to
bear
they
had
told
us
that
even
though
boreas
had
a
breathable
atmosphere
and
a
temperature
not
always
fatally
low
it
was
a
bleak
place
but
to
one
who
had
never
been
far
from
the
lovely
lands
of
earth
its
impact
was
like
a
blow
in
the
face
barbara
shuddered
close
to
me
as
we
came
out
of
the
airlock
and
i
put
an
arm
about
her
waist
knowing
the
sudden
feeling
of
loneliness
which
rose
in
her
save
for
the
spaceport
and
other
installations
main
base
was
underground
there
was
no
city
to
relieve
the
grimness
of
the
scene
we
were
in
a
narrow
valley
between
sheer
ragged
cliffs
that
soared
crazily
into
a
murky
sky
the
sun
was
low
a
smouldering
disc
of
dull
red
like
curdling
blood
its
sullen
light
glimmered
on
the
undying
snow
and
ice
and
seemed
only
to
make
the
land
darker
stars
glittered
here
and
there
in
the
dusky
heavens
hard
and
bright
and
cruel
almost
as
in
space
dark
sky
dark
land
dark
world
with
the
sheer
terrible
mountains
climbing
gauntly
for
the
upper
gloom
crags
and
glaciers
like
fangs
against
the
dizzy
cliffs
with
the
great
shadows
marching
across
the
bloody
snow
toward
us
with
a
crazed
wind
muttering
and
whining
and
chewing
at
our
flesh
it
was
cold
the
cold
was
like
a
knife
pain
stung
with
every
breath
and
eyes
watered
with
tears
that
froze
on
suddenly
numb
cheeks
a
great
shudder
ripped
through
us
and
we
ran
toward
the
entrance
to
the
city
the
snow
crunched
dry
and
old
under
our
boots
the
cold
ate
up
through
the
soles
and
the
wind
whistled
its
scorn
even
when
an
elevator
had
taken
us
a
mile
down
into
the
warmth
and
light
of
the
base
we
could
not
forget
it
was
a
city
for
a
million
men
and
other
beings
and
more
than
a
few
women
and
children
a
city
of
long
streets
and
small
neat
apartments
hydroponic
farms
and
food
synthesizers
schools
shops
and
amusement
places
factories
military
barracks
and
arsenals
even
an
occasional
little
flower
garden
its
people
could
live
here
almost
indefinitely
working
and
waiting
for
their
day
of
rising
there
was
little
formality
in
the
civilian
areas
everyone
who
had
come
this
far
was
trusted
a
man
came
up
to
us
new
arrivals
from
earth
asked
about
conditions
there
and
then
said
he
would
show
us
to
our
quarters
later
we
would
be
told
to
whom
we
should
report
for
duty
let
go
then
con
said
barbara
and
slipped
a
cool
little
hand
into
mine
i
could
not
refrain
from
casting
a
smug
backward
glance
at
the
somewhat
chapfallen
kane
v
we
slipped
quickly
into
the
routine
of
the
place
it
was
a
daily
round
i
could
feel
the
savage
expectancy
building
up
like
a
physical
force
but
intelligent
life
is
adaptable
and
we
got
used
to
it
there
was
work
to
do
hawkins
was
second
in
command
of
the
psychological
service
testing
and
screening
and
treating
personnel
working
on
training
and
indoctrination
and
with
a
voice
in
the
general
staff
where
problems
of
unit
coordination
and
psychological
warfare
were
concerned
barbara
worked
under
him
secretary
and
records
keeper
and
general
those
were
high
posts
but
both
were
allowed
to
retain
the
nominally
civilian
status
which
they
preferred
their
influence
and
my
own
test
scores
got
me
appointed
assistant
supervisor
of
the
shipyards
that
suited
me
very
well
i
was
reasonably
free
from
direct
orders
and
discipline
with
authority
to
come
and
go
pretty
much
as
i
pleased
they
kept
me
busy
sometimes
i
worked
the
clock
around
and
i
did
my
best
to
further
production
of
the
weapons
which
might
destroy
my
planet
for
whatever
i
did
would
make
little
difference
at
this
late
date
a
good
deal
of
my
time
also
went
to
drill
with
the
armed
forces
of
which
like
every
younger
man
i
was
a
reserve
member
they
put
me
in
an
engineer
unit
and
i
soon
had
command
of
it
i
did
my
best
here
too
whipping
my
grim
young
charges
into
a
sapper
group
comparable
to
the
empire
for
i
had
to
be
above
all
suspicion
even
of
incompetence
we
worked
at
our
learning
we
went
topside
and
shivered
and
manned
our
guns
set
our
mines
and
threw
up
our
bridges
in
the
racking
cold
of
boreas
over
ancient
snow
and
ice
we
trotted
lost
in
the
jumbled
wilderness
of
cruel
peaks
and
railing
wind
peeling
the
skin
from
our
fingers
when
we
touched
metal
camped
under
scornful
stars
and
a
lash
of
drifting
but
we
learned
my
own
more
private
education
went
on
apace
i
found
where
we
were
it
was
a
forgotten
red
dwarf
star
out
near
the
shadowy
border
of
the
empire
listed
in
the
catalogues
as
having
one
class
iii
planet
of
no
interest
or
value
that
was
a
good
choice
no
spaceship
would
ever
happen
into
this
system
by
accident
or
exploration
the
anarchs
had
built
their
hopes
on
the
one
lonely
planet
and
had
named
it
boreas
after
the
god
of
the
north
wind
in
one
of
their
mythologies
my
company
called
it
less
complimentary
things
the
base
including
the
attached
city
was
under
military
command
which
ultimately
led
up
to
the
general
staff
of
the
legion
this
was
a
council
of
officers
from
half
a
score
of
rebellious
planets
though
earthlings
predominated
and
of
course
simon
levinsohn
held
the
supreme
authority
i
met
him
a
few
times
a
gaunt
lonely
man
enormously
able
ridden
by
his
cause
as
by
a
nightmare
but
not
unkindly
on
a
personal
level
with
just
that
indomitable
heart
the
maccabees
had
faced
rome
iron
legions
valgolia
was
greatly
interested
in
the
ancient
history
of
a
conquered
province
knowing
how
often
it
held
the
key
to
current
problems
there
was
also
a
liaison
officer
from
luron
sitting
at
staff
meetings
luron
when
i
first
saw
him
this
colonel
wergil
i
stood
stiff
and
cold
and
felt
the
bristling
along
my
spine
he
looked
as
humanoid
as
most
of
the
races
at
the
base
hairless
faintly
scaled
skin
six
fingers
to
a
hand
and
flat
chinless
face
do
make
that
breed
hideous
to
me
i
have
reckoned
ganolons
and
mergri
among
my
friends
but
luron
the
old
and
deadly
rival
the
lesser
empire
watching
its
chance
to
pounce
on
us
hating
us
for
the
check
we
are
on
the
ambitions
of
their
militarists
luron
i
have
no
race
prejudices
and
am
willing
to
take
the
word
of
our
comparative
psychologists
that
there
is
no
more
inherent
evil
in
the
luronians
than
in
any
other
stock
that
the
peculiar
cold
viciousness
of
their
civilization
is
a
matter
of
unfortunate
cultural
rather
than
biological
evolution
and
could
be
changed
in
time
but
none
of
this
alters
the
fact
that
at
present
they
are
what
they
are
brilliant
greedy
heartless
and
a
menace
to
the
peace
of
the
galaxy
i
have
been
too
long
engaged
in
the
struggle
between
my
nation
and
theirs
to
think
otherwise
other
states
had
sent
some
clandestine
help
to
the
legion
weapons
and
money
and
vague
promises
luron
i
soon
found
had
said
it
would
attack
us
in
full
strength
if
the
uprising
showed
a
good
chance
of
success
and
meanwhile
they
gave
assistance
credits
and
materiel
and
the
still
more
important
machine
tools
and
wergil
military
advice
was
useful
i
know
now
as
i
suspected
even
then
that
levinsohn
and
his
associates
were
not
fooled
as
to
luron
ultimate
intentions
indeed
they
planned
to
make
common
cause
with
what
remained
of
valgolia
as
well
as
certain
other
traditional
foes
of
their
present
ally
as
soon
as
they
had
gained
their
objectives
of
independence
and
stop
any
threat
of
aggression
from
luron
it
was
shrewdly
planned
but
such
a
shaky
coalition
still
bleeding
with
the
hurts
and
hatreds
of
a
struggle
just
ended
would
be
weaker
than
the
empire
and
luron
almost
certainly
would
have
sowed
further
dissension
in
it
and
waited
for
its
decay
before
striking
the
earthlings
have
a
proverb
to
the
effect
that
he
who
sups
with
the
devil
must
use
a
long
spoon
but
they
seemed
to
have
forgotten
it
now
the
attack
i
learned
was
scheduled
for
about
four
months
from
the
time
the
agents
were
recalled
the
rebels
were
counting
on
the
valgolian
power
being
spread
too
thinly
over
the
empire
to
stand
off
their
massed
assault
on
a
few
key
points
then
with
the
home
planet
a
radioactive
ruin
with
revolt
in
a
score
of
planetary
systems
and
the
ensuing
chaos
and
communications
breakdown
and
with
the
luronians
invading
the
imperial
fleet
and
military
would
have
to
make
terms
with
the
anarchs
it
would
work
i
knew
with
a
dark
chill
that
it
would
work
unless
somehow
i
could
get
a
warning
out
that
had
to
be
done
for
more
than
the
protection
of
epsilon
eridani
which
even
in
a
surprise
attack
could
defend
itself
better
than
these
conspirators
realized
but
all
bloodshed
should
be
spared
if
possible
and
the
rebellion
did
not
yet
deserve
to
succeed
for
the
unity
achieved
thus
far
had
been
the
unity
of
a
snake
pit
against
a
temporary
enemy
did
it
all
rest
on
me
god
of
space
had
the
whole
burden
of
history
suddenly
fallen
on
shoulders
i
did
dare
think
about
it
i
forced
the
consequences
of
failure
out
of
my
forebrain
back
down
into
the
unconscious
the
breeding
ground
of
nightmares
and
lived
from
one
day
to
the
next
i
worked
and
waited
learned
what
i
could
and
watched
for
my
chance
but
it
was
not
all
grimness
and
concentration
it
could
be
intelligent
life
just
is
built
that
way
we
had
our
social
activities
small
gatherings
or
big
parties
we
relaxed
and
played
at
first
i
found
that
gratifying
for
it
gave
me
a
chance
to
pump
the
others
then
i
found
it
maddening
because
it
kept
me
from
snooping
and
laying
plans
finally
it
began
to
hurt
i
was
coming
to
know
the
anarchs
they
lived
and
laughed
and
loved
even
as
humans
do
they
were
basically
as
decent
and
reasonable
as
any
similar
group
of
valgolians
many
were
as
tormented
as
i
by
the
thought
of
the
slaughter
they
readied
there
were
embittered
ones
who
had
lost
all
they
held
dear
and
i
realized
that
while
civilization
has
its
price
you
ca
be
objective
about
it
when
you
are
the
one
who
must
pay
there
were
others
who
had
been
well
off
and
had
chucked
all
their
hopes
to
join
a
desperate
cause
in
which
they
happened
to
believe
there
were
children
and
what
had
they
done
to
deserve
having
their
parents
gambling
away
life
in
spite
of
their
appearance
to
which
i
was
now
accustomed
they
were
when
i
had
laughed
and
talked
and
sung
and
drunk
beer
and
danced
and
arranged
entertainments
with
them
they
were
my
friends
moodily
i
began
to
see
that
i
would
be
one
of
the
i
saw
most
of
hawkins
and
barbara
and
after
them
because
of
her
kane
the
old
psychologist
and
i
got
along
famously
he
would
drop
into
my
room
for
a
smoke
and
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
drawled
conversation
whenever
he
had
the
chance
his
slow
gentle
voice
his
trenchancy
the
way
the
little
crinkles
appeared
around
his
eyes
when
he
smiled
reminded
me
of
my
father
i
often
wish
those
two
could
have
met
they
would
have
enjoyed
each
other
then
barbara
would
stop
by
on
her
way
from
work
or
better
yet
she
would
ask
me
over
to
her
apartment
for
a
dinner
yes
she
could
cook
too
we
would
sometimes
take
long
walks
down
the
corridors
of
the
city
we
even
went
up
once
in
a
while
to
the
surface
for
a
breath
of
cold
air
and
loneliness
and
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
for
us
to
go
hand
in
hand
there
was
no
sunlight
underground
but
when
the
fluorotube
glow
shone
on
her
hair
i
thought
of
sunlight
on
earth
the
high
keen
light
of
the
colorado
plateaus
the
morning
light
stealing
through
the
trees
of
hood
island
ydis
i
said
once
your
violet
eyes
were
like
the
skies
over
kalariho
over
kealvigh
our
home
pasture
land
of
winds
but
it
has
been
so
long
it
has
been
ten
years
since
you
died
i
fought
may
all
the
gods
bear
witness
that
i
fought
myself
and
i
thought
i
was
winning
vi
i
will
never
forget
one
certain
evening
hawkins
and
i
had
come
over
to
barbara
for
supper
and
the
three
of
us
were
sitting
now
talking
wieniawski
violin
concerto
cried
its
sorrow
muted
in
the
background
and
the
serene
home
she
had
made
of
the
bare
little
functional
apartment
folded
itself
around
us
then
kane
dropped
in
as
he
often
did
with
a
casualness
that
fooled
nobody
and
sat
with
all
his
soul
in
his
eyes
looking
at
barbara
he
was
a
nice
kid
i
did
know
why
he
should
annoy
me
so
the
talk
shifted
to
valgolia
i
found
myself
taking
the
side
of
my
race
it
was
that
i
hoped
to
convert
anyone
but
well
it
was
wrong
that
we
should
be
monsters
in
the
sight
of
these
friends
brutes
said
kane
animals
damned
giants
would
be
quite
so
bad
if
they
were
octopi
or
insects
but
they
just
enough
different
from
us
to
be
a
caricature
it
obscene
sartons
look
like
a
dirty
joke
on
mankind
i
said
why
do
you
object
to
them
they
in
the
same
boat
as
us
then
why
mix
political
and
esthetic
prejudices
and
have
you
ever
thought
that
you
look
just
as
funny
to
an
eridanian
no
race
should
look
odd
to
another
said
nat
hawkins
he
puffed
blue
clouds
even
by
our
standards
the
redskins
are
handsome
in
a
more
spectacular
way
than
humans
maybe
and
barbara
i
smiled
with
a
curious
little
pang
inside
me
would
look
good
to
any
humanoid
i
should
think
so
said
kane
sulkily
the
redskins
took
enough
of
our
women
well
i
said
their
original
conquistadores
were
young
and
healthy
very
far
from
home
and
had
just
finished
a
hard
campaign
where
they
lost
many
friends
at
least
there
were
no
afterward
and
since
the
reconquest
none
of
their
soldiers
has
been
permitted
to
have
anything
to
do
with
an
earthwoman
against
her
consent
it
not
their
fault
if
the
consent
is
forthcoming
oftener
than
you
idealists
think
that
sort
of
thing
was
more
or
less
standard
procedure
at
home
with
them
was
it
asked
hawkins
i
nodded
the
harshness
of
their
native
world
forced
them
to
develop
their
technology
faster
than
on
earth
so
they
kept
a
lot
of
barbarian
customs
well
into
the
industrial
age
for
instance
the
rulers
of
the
state
that
finally
conquered
all
the
others
and
unified
the
planet
took
the
title
emperor
and
it
still
a
monarchy
in
theory
but
a
limited
monarchy
these
days
with
parliamentary
democracy
and
even
local
of
the
sort
they
highly
civilized
now
i
would
call
that
spree
of
conquest
they
went
on
exactly
civilized
well
just
for
argument
sake
let
try
to
look
at
it
from
their
side
i
answered
here
their
explorers
arrived
at
sol
found
a
system
richer
than
they
could
well
imagine
and
all
the
wealth
being
burned
up
in
fratricidal
war
their
technical
power
was
sufficiently
beyond
ours
so
that
any
band
of
adventurers
could
do
pretty
much
as
it
wanted
in
the
solar
system
and
all
native
states
were
begging
for
their
help
it
was
inevitable
that
they
mix
in
sure
the
eridanians
have
been
exploiting
solarian
resources
though
perhaps
more
wisely
than
we
did
sure
they
garrison
unwilling
planets
but
from
their
point
of
view
they
slowly
civilizing
a
race
of
savages
and
taking
no
more
than
their
just
reward
for
it
sure
they
done
hideous
things
or
were
supposed
to
have
but
there
been
plenty
of
reforms
in
their
policy
since
our
last
revolt
they
adopted
the
the
red
man
burden
could
be
but
sol
was
their
only
conquest
oh
well
of
course
they
had
their
time
of
imperialism
there
are
still
plenty
of
the
old
school
around
starward
the
course
of
empire
keep
the
lesser
breeds
in
their
place
and
so
on
that
one
reason
why
the
highest
posts
are
still
reserved
for
members
of
their
own
race
another
being
that
even
the
liberal
ones
do
trust
us
that
far
yet
their
first
fifty
years
or
so
saw
plenty
of
aggression
but
then
they
stabilized
they
had
as
much
as
they
could
manage
to
put
it
baldly
the
empire
is
glutted
and
now
without
actually
admitting
they
ever
did
wrong
they
trying
to
make
up
what
they
did
to
many
of
their
victims
they
could
do
that
easily
enough
just
let
us
go
free
i
already
told
you
why
they
do
dare
apart
from
fearing
us
they
economically
and
militarily
dependent
on
their
colonies
an
american
nat
why
did
our
nation
let
the
south
go
its
own
way
when
it
wanted
to
secede
why
do
we
all
go
back
to
europe
and
let
the
indians
have
our
country
and
of
course
epsilon
eridani
honestly
thinks
it
has
a
great
civilizing
mission
and
is
much
better
for
the
natives
than
any
lesser
independence
could
ever
be
in
some
cases
you
got
to
admit
right
have
you
ever
seen
a
real
native
king
in
action
or
read
the
history
of
nations
like
germany
and
russia
and
why
do
we
have
to
segregate
races
and
minorities
even
in
our
own
organization
to
prevent
clashes
we
getting
there
said
nat
hawkins
it
not
easy
but
we
make
it
you
not
there
i
thought
for
that
reason
you
must
be
you
claim
they
sated
said
barbara
but
they
kept
on
conquering
here
and
there
to
this
very
day
believe
it
or
not
but
with
rare
exceptions
that
been
done
reluctantly
peripheral
systems
have
learned
how
to
build
star
ships
become
nuisances
or
outright
menaces
and
the
empire
has
had
to
swallow
them
modern
technology
is
simply
too
deadly
for
anarchy
a
war
can
sterilize
whole
planets
that
another
function
of
empire
so
the
eridanians
claim
just
to
keep
civilization
going
till
something
better
can
be
worked
out
such
as
what
well
several
worlds
already
have
status
under
the
emperor
representatives
in
the
imperial
council
and
no
restrictions
on
personal
advancement
of
their
citizens
virtual
equality
with
the
valgolians
and
their
policy
is
to
grant
such
status
to
any
colony
they
think
is
ready
for
it
hawkins
shook
his
head
wo
do
con
it
sounds
nice
but
old
tom
jefferson
had
the
right
idea
men
must
wait
in
slavery
until
they
are
ready
for
freedom
they
will
wait
long
indeed
who
said
we
were
slaves
i
began
you
talk
like
a
damned
reddie
yourself
said
kane
you
seem
to
think
pretty
highly
of
the
empire
i
gave
him
a
cold
look
what
do
you
think
i
doing
here
i
snapped
yeah
yeah
sorry
i
kind
of
tired
maybe
i
better
go
now
before
long
kane
made
some
rather
moody
good
nights
and
went
out
nat
hawkins
twinkled
at
me
i
a
little
bushed
myself
he
said
guess
i
hit
the
bunk
too
when
he
was
gone
i
sat
smoking
and
trying
to
gather
up
the
will
to
leave
there
was
a
darkness
in
me
what
after
all
i
doing
here
gods
i
believed
i
was
in
the
right
but
why
is
right
so
pitiless
on
earth
they
represent
the
goddess
of
justice
as
blind
on
valgolia
she
has
fangs
barbara
came
over
and
sat
on
the
arm
of
my
chair
what
the
matter
con
she
asked
you
look
pretty
grim
these
days
my
work
developing
some
complications
i
said
tonelessly
my
mind
added
sure
is
no
way
to
call
headquarters
the
rebellion
gathering
enormous
momentum
and
on
a
basis
of
treachery
and
racial
barbara
fingers
rumpled
my
hair
the
grafted
hair
which
by
now
felt
more
a
part
of
me
than
my
own
lost
crest
you
an
odd
fellow
she
said
quietly
on
the
surface
so
frank
and
friendly
and
cheerful
and
down
underneath
you
hiding
yourself
and
your
private
unhappiness
why
i
looked
up
at
her
astonished
even
the
psychologists
they
limited
con
they
can
measure
but
they
ca
feel
not
the
way
she
stopped
and
the
light
glowed
in
her
hair
and
her
eyes
were
wide
and
serious
on
mine
and
one
small
hand
stole
over
to
touch
my
fingers
blindly
i
wrenched
my
face
away
her
voice
was
low
it
some
other
woman
is
it
other
well
no
there
was
one
but
she
dead
now
she
died
ten
years
ago
ydis
your
wife
i
nodded
we
were
only
married
for
three
years
my
daughter
is
still
alive
she
going
on
twelve
now
but
i
have
seen
her
for
over
two
years
she
not
on
earth
i
wonder
if
she
even
thinks
of
me
con
said
barbara
very
softly
and
gravely
you
ca
go
on
mourning
a
woman
forever
i
not
forget
it
i
should
have
spoken
about
it
you
needed
to
that
all
right
my
girl
ought
to
have
a
mother
the
words
came
of
themselves
what
followed
thereafter
seemed
also
to
happen
without
my
willing
it
presently
barbara
stood
back
from
me
she
was
laughing
low
and
sweet
and
joyous
con
you
old
sourpuss
cheer
up
it
is
that
bad
you
know
i
managed
a
wry
grin
though
it
seemed
to
need
all
the
energies
left
in
me
you
look
so
happy
your
fool
self
that
i
have
to
it
con
if
you
knew
how
i
been
hoping
we
talked
for
a
long
time
but
she
did
most
of
it
the
plans
the
hopes
the
trip
we
were
going
to
take
and
the
house
we
were
going
to
build
down
by
the
seashore
mary
my
daughter
was
going
to
have
a
home
along
with
the
dozen
brothers
and
sisters
she
have
in
due
course
after
the
war
after
the
war
i
left
finally
stumbling
like
a
blind
man
toward
my
quarters
oh
yes
i
loved
her
and
she
loved
me
and
we
were
going
to
have
a
home
and
a
sailboat
and
a
dozen
children
after
the
war
when
earth
was
free
what
more
could
a
man
ask
for
it
had
been
many
years
since
i
needed
autohypnosis
to
put
myself
to
sleep
but
i
used
it
now
vii
a
month
passed
the
delay
was
partly
due
to
the
slowness
with
which
i
had
to
work
even
after
a
plan
had
been
laid
i
could
only
do
a
little
at
a
time
and
the
times
had
to
be
well
separated
each
day
brought
the
moment
of
onslaught
closer
but
i
dared
not
hurry
myself
if
they
caught
me
at
my
work
there
would
be
an
end
of
all
things
but
i
can
not
swear
that
my
own
mind
did
not
prompt
me
to
an
unnatural
slowness
and
caution
i
was
only
human
and
every
day
was
one
more
memory
they
had
all
been
very
good
to
us
our
friends
had
a
party
to
celebrate
our
engagement
and
we
were
universally
congratulated
and
all
the
rest
of
it
yes
kane
was
there
too
shaking
my
hand
and
wishing
me
all
the
luck
in
the
world
afterward
he
went
back
to
his
work
and
his
practice
with
a
strange
fierceness
if
at
times
i
fell
into
glum
abstraction
well
i
had
always
been
a
little
moody
and
barbara
could
tease
me
out
of
it
most
of
the
times
i
was
with
her
i
did
think
about
the
future
at
all
there
had
been
a
certain
deep
inward
coldness
to
her
she
had
carried
the
old
wound
of
her
losses
with
bitter
dignity
but
as
the
days
went
on
i
saw
less
and
less
of
it
she
would
even
admit
that
individual
valgolians
might
be
fine
fellows
and
that
the
empire
had
done
a
few
constructive
things
for
earth
but
it
was
more
than
a
change
of
attitude
she
was
thawing
after
a
long
winter
she
laughed
more
she
was
wholly
human
now
we
sat
one
evening
she
and
i
in
one
of
the
big
lounges
the
base
had
for
its
personnel
there
were
only
one
or
two
muted
lights
in
the
long
quiet
room
a
breathing
of
music
snatches
of
whispering
like
our
own
she
sat
close
against
me
and
my
lips
kept
straying
down
to
brush
her
hair
and
her
cheek
when
we
married
she
said
dreamily
then
all
at
once
con
what
are
we
waiting
for
i
looked
at
her
in
some
surprise
con
why
do
we
assume
we
ca
get
married
before
the
war
over
her
voice
was
low
and
hurried
shaking
just
a
little
the
base
here
has
chaplains
it
less
than
a
month
now
till
the
business
starts
god
knows
what
happen
then
either
of
us
might
be
killed
i
heard
her
gulp
con
if
they
killed
you
they
wo
i
said
i
no
no
we
have
so
little
time
and
it
may
be
all
we
ever
have
marry
me
now
darling
dearest
and
at
least
there
be
something
to
remember
whatever
comes
we
have
had
that
while
i
tell
you
i
insisted
with
a
sudden
hideous
dismay
nothing
to
worry
about
forget
it
oh
i
not
asking
for
pity
i
more
happiness
now
than
is
right
maybe
that
why
i
afraid
but
con
they
killed
my
father
and
they
killed
my
mother
and
they
killed
jimmy
and
if
they
take
you
too
be
more
than
i
can
stand
the
savage
woe
of
an
old
earthly
poet
lanced
through
my
brain
the
time
is
out
of
joint
o
cursèd
spite
that
ever
i
was
born
to
set
it
right
and
then
for
just
a
moment
there
came
the
notion
of
yielding
love
the
girl
conru
you
love
her
so
much
it
a
pain
in
you
well
take
her
marry
her
no
i
was
not
excessively
tender
of
heart
or
conscience
but
neither
was
i
that
kind
of
scoundrel
i
kissed
her
words
away
afterward
alone
in
the
darkness
of
my
room
i
realized
that
conrad
haugen
had
no
good
reason
to
hang
back
it
was
true
all
she
said
was
true
and
no
other
couple
was
waiting
for
an
uncertain
future
it
was
the
time
for
action
i
had
been
ready
for
days
now
postponing
the
moment
and
those
days
were
marching
to
the
time
of
war
the
rebels
were
quivering
to
go
a
scant
few
weeks
at
most
lay
between
me
and
the
ruin
of
valgolian
plans
and
work
and
hope
in
my
steadily
expanding
official
capacity
i
could
go
anywhere
and
do
almost
anything
in
an
engineering
line
so
bit
by
bit
i
had
tinkered
with
the
base
general
alarm
system
we
had
scoutships
posted
of
course
but
by
the
very
nature
of
things
they
had
to
be
close
to
the
planet
or
an
approaching
enemy
would
slip
between
them
without
detection
and
the
substantial
vibrations
of
a
ship
traveling
faster
than
light
do
not
arrive
much
ahead
of
the
ship
itself
whatever
warning
we
had
of
a
hypothetical
assault
would
be
very
short
it
would
be
signaled
to
all
of
us
by
a
siren
on
the
intercommunications
system
and
after
that
it
would
be
battle
stations
naval
units
to
their
ships
and
all
others
to
such
ground
defenses
as
we
had
but
modern
warfare
is
all
to
the
offense
there
is
no
way
of
stopping
an
attack
from
space
except
by
meeting
it
and
annihilating
it
before
it
gets
to
its
destination
the
rebels
were
counting
on
that
fact
to
aid
them
when
they
struck
but
it
would
of
course
work
against
them
if
their
enemy
should
happen
to
hit
first
everyone
was
understandably
nervous
about
the
chance
of
our
being
discovered
and
assailed
working
a
little
at
a
time
i
had
put
a
special
switch
in
the
general
alarm
circuit
it
showed
up
merely
as
one
of
many
on
a
sector
call
board
near
my
room
no
one
was
likely
to
notice
it
and
my
quarters
were
not
those
originally
given
me
i
had
moved
to
a
smaller
place
farther
from
barbara
ostensibly
to
be
near
my
work
at
the
shipyards
actually
to
be
near
the
base
ultrabeam
shack
now
it
was
time
to
act
i
needed
an
excuse
for
not
going
to
the
gun
turret
where
i
was
assigned
that
involved
faking
a
serious
fever
but
like
all
intelligence
men
i
had
been
trained
to
full
psychosomatic
integration
the
same
neural
forces
that
in
hysteria
produce
paralysis
stigmata
and
other
real
symptoms
were
under
my
conscious
control
i
thought
myself
sick
by
morning
i
was
half
delirious
and
my
veins
were
on
fire
the
surgeon
general
came
to
see
me
what
the
hell
the
trouble
he
wondered
this
place
is
supposed
to
be
sterile
maybe
it
too
damn
sterile
i
murmured
with
a
perfectly
genuine
weakness
then
fighting
the
that
hummed
and
buzzed
in
me
fever
doc
i
sure
that
what
it
is
ca
say
i
ever
heard
of
it
you
find
it
in
your
medical
books
he
would
too
it
found
on
the
planet
sirius
v
where
i
once
visited
virus
transmitted
by
airborne
spores
not
contagious
here
in
humans
it
becomes
chronic
no
ill
effects
except
a
few
days
fever
like
this
every
few
years
now
go
and
lem
me
die
in
peace
i
closed
my
eyes
on
the
distorted
and
unreal
world
of
sickness
later
barbara
came
in
pale
and
with
her
hair
like
a
rumpled
halo
i
had
to
assure
her
many
times
that
i
was
all
right
and
would
be
on
my
feet
in
two
or
three
days
then
she
smiled
and
sat
down
on
the
bunk
and
passed
a
cool
palm
over
my
forehead
poor
con
she
said
poor
squarehead
i
feel
fine
as
long
as
you
here
i
whispered
do
talk
she
said
just
go
to
sleep
she
kissed
me
and
sat
quiet
hers
was
the
rare
gift
of
being
a
definite
personality
even
when
silent
and
motionless
i
clasped
her
hand
and
pretended
to
fall
into
uneasy
sleep
after
a
while
she
kissed
me
again
very
softly
and
went
out
i
told
my
body
to
recover
it
took
time
hours
of
time
while
the
stubborn
cells
retreated
to
a
normal
level
of
activity
i
lay
there
thinking
of
many
things
most
of
them
unpleasant
it
was
well
into
the
night
the
logical
time
to
act
even
if
the
factories
did
go
on
a
hour
basis
i
got
up
still
swaying
a
little
with
weakness
the
dregs
of
the
fever
ringing
in
my
head
after
i
had
vomited
and
swallowed
a
stimulant
tablet
i
felt
better
i
put
on
my
uniform
but
substituted
a
plain
service
jacket
without
insignia
of
rank
for
the
tunic
that
should
make
me
fairly
inconspicuous
in
the
confusion
strength
came
i
glanced
cautiously
along
the
corridor
and
it
was
empty
and
silent
i
stole
out
and
hurried
toward
the
ultrabeam
shack
my
hidden
switch
was
on
the
way
i
threw
it
and
ran
on
with
lowered
head
the
siren
screamed
behind
me
before
me
around
me
the
howling
of
all
the
devils
in
hell
hoo
battle
stations
strange
ships
approaching
battle
stations
all
hands
to
battle
stations
i
could
imagine
the
pandemonium
that
erupted
men
boiling
out
of
factories
and
rooms
cursing
and
yelling
and
dashing
frantically
for
their
posts
children
screaming
in
terror
women
with
sudden
numbness
weapons
manned
instruments
sweeping
the
skies
spaceships
roaring
heavenward
incoherent
yelling
on
the
intercoms
to
find
out
who
had
given
that
signal
with
luck
i
would
have
fifteen
minutes
or
half
an
hour
of
safe
insanity
a
few
men
raced
by
me
on
their
way
to
the
nearest
missile
rack
they
paid
me
no
heed
and
i
hurried
along
my
own
path
the
winding
stair
leading
up
to
the
ultrabeam
shack
loomed
before
me
i
went
its
length
three
steps
at
a
time
bounding
and
gasping
with
my
haste
up
to
the
transmitter
it
was
the
tenuous
link
binding
together
a
score
of
rebel
planets
the
only
communication
with
the
stars
that
glittered
so
coldly
overhead
the
ultrabeam
does
not
have
an
infinite
velocity
but
it
does
have
an
unlimited
speed
one
depending
solely
on
the
frequency
of
the
generating
equipment
and
since
it
only
goes
to
such
receivers
as
are
tuned
to
its
pattern
there
must
be
at
least
one
such
tuned
unit
for
the
generator
to
work
it
has
a
virtually
infinite
range
so
men
can
talk
between
the
stars
but
are
their
words
the
wiser
for
that
up
and
up
and
up
round
and
round
up
and
up
metal
clanging
underfoot
and
always
the
demon
screech
of
the
siren
up
i
sprang
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
crossed
the
areaway
in
one
leap
to
the
open
door
of
the
shack
there
was
only
one
operator
on
duty
a
slim
boyish
figure
before
the
glittering
panel
he
did
hear
me
as
i
came
behind
him
i
knocked
him
out
with
a
calculated
blow
to
the
base
of
the
skull
he
be
unconscious
for
at
least
fifteen
minutes
and
that
was
time
enough
i
heaved
his
body
out
of
the
chair
and
sat
down
the
unit
was
set
for
the
complicated
secret
scrambler
pattern
of
the
legion
one
which
was
changed
periodically
just
in
case
i
twirled
the
dials
adjusting
for
the
pattern
of
the
set
i
knew
was
kept
tuned
for
me
at
vorka
headquarters
the
set
hummed
warming
up
i
lifted
my
eyes
and
stared
into
the
naked
face
of
boreas
the
shack
was
above
ground
itself
dominated
by
the
skeletal
tower
of
the
transmitter
and
a
broad
port
revealed
land
and
sky
overhead
the
stars
were
glittering
bright
and
hard
and
cruel
flashing
and
flashing
out
of
the
crystal
dark
the
peaks
rose
on
every
side
soaring
dizziness
of
cliffs
and
ragged
snarl
of
crags
hemming
us
in
with
our
tiny
works
and
struggles
it
was
bitterly
ringingly
cold
out
there
the
snow
screamed
when
you
walked
on
it
the
snapping
thunder
of
rock
woke
the
dull
roar
of
avalanches
and
there
was
the
wind
the
old
immortal
wind
moaning
and
blowing
and
wandering
under
the
stars
i
saw
them
running
little
antlike
men
spilling
from
their
nest
and
racing
across
the
snow
before
they
froze
i
saw
the
ships
rise
one
after
the
other
and
rush
darkly
skyward
the
base
had
come
alive
and
was
reaching
up
to
defy
the
haughty
stars
the
set
buzzed
and
whistled
warming
up
muttering
with
the
cosmic
interference
whose
source
nobody
knows
i
began
to
speak
into
the
microphone
softly
and
urgently
calling
intelligence
hq

north

captain

conru
calling
north

come
in
center
come
in
the
receiver
rustled
with
the
thin
dry
voice
of
the
stars
dimly
i
could
hear
the
wind
outside
snarling
around
the
walls
come
in
center
come
in
center
captain
halgan
the
voice
rattled
into
the
waiting
stillness
of
the
shack
captain
halgan
is
it
really
you
get
general
vorka
at
once
i
said
meanwhile
are
you
recording
all
right
be
sure
you
get
this
i
told
them
everything
i
knew
i
told
them
what
planet
this
was
and
where
we
were
on
its
surface
and
what
our
strength
and
plans
were
i
gave
them
the
disposition
of
the
scoutship
pickets
as
far
as
those
were
known
to
me
and
the
standard
legion
recognition
signals
i
finished
with
an
account
of
the
savage
differences
still
existing
between
earthman
and
earthman
and
earth
and
its
treacherous
allies
and
all
the
time
i
was
talking
to
a
recording
machine
nobody
was
listening
when
i
was
through
i
waited
a
minute
not
feeling
any
particular
emotion
i
was
too
tired
i
sat
there
listening
to
the
wind
and
the
interstellar
whistling
till
vorka
spoke
to
me
halgan
halgan
you
done
it
shut
up
i
said
what
coming
now
i
checked
the
fleet
units
we
have
a
supernova
with
escort
at
bramgar
about
fifteen
from
where
you
are
you
are
at
their
base
are
you
can
you
hold
out
for
two
days
more
i
think
so
better
get
into
the
hills
we
may
have
to
bombard
go
to
hell
i
turned
off
the
set
now
to
get
back
they
must
already
know
it
was
a
trick
they
must
be
scouring
the
base
for
the
saboteur
as
soon
as
all
loyal
men
were
back
the
hunt
would
really
be
on
i
had
of
course
worn
gloves
there
would
be
no
fingerprints
and
the
operator
would
know
who
had
attacked
him
i
changed
the
scrambler
setting
to
one
picked
at
random
and
in
a
corner
as
if
it
had
fallen
there
by
accident
i
dropped
a
handkerchief
stolen
from
wergil
of
luron
the
tiny
fragments
of
tissue
which
adhere
to
such
a
thing
could
easily
be
proven
to
be
from
him
or
one
of
his
associates
for
the
basic
luronian
are
all
it
might
help
i
slipped
back
down
the
stairs
quickly
and
quietly
it
was
over
the
base
was
as
good
as
taken
but
there
was
more
to
be
done
apart
from
the
saving
of
my
own
life
there
was
still
a
desperate
need
for
secrecy
for
if
the
rebels
knew
what
was
coming
they
might
choose
to
stand
and
fight
or
they
might
flee
into
the
roadless
wildernesses
of
space
whichever
it
was
all
our
work
and
sacrifice
would
have
gone
for
little
the
provocateur
policy
is
the
boldest
and
most
farsighted
enterprise
ever
undertaken
it
is
the
first
attempt
to
make
history
as
we
choose
to
control
the
great
social
forces
we
are
only
dimly
beginning
to
understand
so
that
intelligence
may
ultimately
be
its
own
master
sure
very
fine
and
idealistic
and
no
doubt
fairly
true
as
well
but
there
is
death
and
treachery
in
it
loneliness
and
heartbreak
and
the
bitterness
of
the
betrayed
have
we
the
right
to
set
ourselves
up
as
god
can
we
really
say
in
our
omniscience
that
everyone
but
us
is
wrong
there
were
sane
decent
intelligent
folk
here
on
boreas
the
ones
we
needed
so
desperately
for
all
civilization
did
we
have
to
make
them
our
enemies
so
that
their
grandchildren
might
be
our
friends
i
did
know
wherever
i
turned
there
were
treason
and
injustice
however
hard
i
tried
to
do
right
i
had
to
wrong
somebody
i
ran
on
back
to
my
cabin
i
peeled
off
my
clothes
and
dived
into
bed
and
by
the
time
they
looked
in
on
me
i
had
worked
back
most
of
my
fever
do
think
conru
do
think
of
this
new
victory
and
the
safety
of
the
empire
and
perhaps
a
step
closer
to
the
harshly
won
unity
of
earth
do
think
of
the
way
the
light
catches
in
barbara
hair
and
gets
turned
into
molten
gold
you
got
a
fever
to
create
man
got
to
think
yourself
sick
again
that
ought
to
be
easy
viii
barbara
came
in
she
was
white
and
still
and
presently
she
leaned
her
head
against
my
breast
and
cried
quietly
for
a
long
time
there
is
a
spy
here
she
told
me
i
heard
about
it
i
stroked
her
hair
and
held
her
to
me
clumsily
do
you
know
who
it
was
i
do
know
somehow
they
seem
to
think
the
luronians
may
be
guilty
but
they
are
sure
they
arrested
them
and
two
were
killed
resisting
colonel
wergil
is
in
the
brig
now
while
they
decide
if
luron
can
still
be
trusted
it
ca
i
said
earth
must
win
alone
we
win
she
said
dauntlessly
with
luron
or
without
it
win
then
like
a
little
frightened
girl
creeping
close
to
me
but
we
needed
that
help
so
much
i
kissed
her
and
remained
silent
the
next
day
i
got
on
my
feet
again
weak
but
recovered
i
wandered
aimlessly
around
the
base
waiting
for
barbara
to
get
through
work
listening
to
people
talk
it
was
ugly
the
fear
and
tension
and
wolfish
watchfulness
can
we
trust
who
is
the
enemy
mostly
they
thought
the
luronians
were
guilty
after
all
those
were
the
only
beings
on
the
planet
who
had
not
had
to
pass
a
rigorous
investigation
and
psychological
examination
but
nobody
was
sure
levinsohn
spoke
over
the
televisor
his
gaunt
lined
face
had
grown
very
tired
yet
there
was
metal
in
his
voice
the
new
situation
necessitated
a
change
of
plans
but
the
time
of
assault
would
if
anything
be
moved
ahead
be
of
good
heart
stand
by
your
comrades
we
still
be
free
i
went
to
barbara
apartment
and
we
sat
up
very
late
but
even
in
this
private
record
i
do
not
wish
to
say
what
we
talked
about
and
the
next
day
the
empire
came
there
was
one
supernova
ship
with
light
escort
but
that
was
enough
such
vessels
have
the
mass
of
a
large
asteroid
and
one
of
them
can
sterilize
a
planet
two
or
three
can
take
it
apart
theoretically
a
task
force
comprising
twenty
battleships
with
escorts
can
reduce
one
of
those
monsters
if
it
is
willing
to
lose
most
of
its
units
but
nothing
less
can
even
do
significant
damage
and
the
rebel
base
did
not
have
that
much
nor
could
they
get
even
what
they
had
into
full
action
the
ships
rushed
out
of
interstellar
space
flashing
the
recognition
signals
i
had
given
before
the
picket
vessels
suspected
what
was
wrong
the
valgolians
were
on
them
one
managed
to
bleat
a
call
to
base
and
the
alarm
screamed
again
men
rushed
to
battle
stations
then
the
imperials
blanketed
all
communications
with
a
snarl
of
interference
through
which
nothing
the
rebels
had
could
drive
so
naturally
they
were
thought
to
have
been
annihilated
in
a
few
swift
blazes
of
fire
and
steel
a
quick
clean
death
and
forgetfulness
of
defeat
but
only
the
drivers
were
crippled
and
then
the
supernova
yanked
the
vessels
to
its
titan
flanks
and
held
them
in
unbreakable
gravity
beams
the
crews
would
be
taken
later
with
narcotic
gas
or
paralyzer
beams
alive
for
the
empire
needs
its
rebels
i
knew
the
uselessness
of
going
to
battle
stations
so
i
hung
behind
seeking
out
barbara
whose
place
was
with
the
missile
computer
bank
i
met
her
and
kane
in
the
hallway
the
boy
face
was
white
and
there
were
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
this
is
the
end
he
said
they
found
us
out
and
there
nothing
left
but
to
die
good
by
barbara
he
kissed
her
wildly
and
ran
for
his
ship
moodily
i
watched
him
go
he
expected
death
and
he
would
get
only
capture
and
afterward
what
are
you
doing
here
con
asked
barbara
i
too
shaky
to
be
any
good
in
the
artillery
let
me
go
with
you
i
can
punch
a
computer
she
nodded
silently
and
we
went
off
together
the
floor
shook
under
us
and
a
crash
of
rock
roared
down
the
halls
the
heavy
weapons
on
the
supernova
were
bloodlessly
reducing
our
ground
installations
and
our
ships
not
yet
in
action
to
smashed
rubble
they
would
kill
not
a
single
one
of
us
except
by
uncontrollable
accident
and
save
many
valgolian
and
earth
lives
that
way
but
it
pleasant
to
be
slugged
the
girl
and
i
staggered
ahead
when
the
lights
went
out
i
stopped
and
held
her
it
no
use
i
said
they
got
us
let
me
go
she
cried
i
hung
on
and
suddenly
she
collapsed
against
me
crying
and
shaking
we
stood
there
with
the
city
rumbling
and
shivering
around
us
waiting
presently
the
valgolian
commander
released
the
interference
and
contacted
levinsohn
offering
terms
of
surrender
it
seemed
to
levinsohn
and
it
was
meant
to
seem
that
further
resistance
would
be
useless
butchery
his
ships
were
gone
and
his
foes
need
only
bombard
him
to
ruin
he
capitulated
and
one
by
one
we
laid
down
our
arms
and
filed
to
meet
the
victors
the
terms
as
announced
by
messengers
the
intercom
was
out
of
action
were
generous
leading
rebels
and
those
judged
potentially
dangerous
would
go
to
penal
colonies
on
various
earthlike
planets
except
that
they
were
penal
colonies
at
all
but
of
course
the
earthlings
would
know
this
they
were
indoctrination
centers
and
with
all
my
bitterness
i
still
longed
to
observe
a
man
like
levinsohn
after
five
years
in
one
of
the
centers
he
see
things
in
a
different
perspective
he
see
the
empire
for
what
it
was
even
if
i
sometimes
had
a
little
trouble
seeing
that
now
and
he
be
a
better
rebel
for
it
someday
levinsohn
and
his
kind
would
be
back
on
earth
the
new
leaders
ready
to
lead
the
way
to
a
new
tomorrow
and
i
would
be
with
them
i
be
back
with
levinsohn
and
the
rest
and
with
barbara
too
and
we
try
to
pave
the
way
to
the
peace
and
friendship
but
meanwhile
there
be
other
revolutions
striving
and
hoping
and
breaking
their
hearts
daring
what
they
thought
would
be
death
to
win
what
they
called
freedom
and
what
we
hoped
would
be
evolution
it
was
the
fire
to
temper
a
new
civilization
we
walked
down
the
hall
barbara
and
i
hand
in
hand
alone
in
spite
of
all
the
people
who
were
shuffling
the
same
way
most
of
them
were
weeping
but
barbara
head
was
high
now
what
will
happen
to
us
she
asked
i
do
know
i
said
but
barbara
whatever
happens
after
this
remember
that
i
love
you
remember
that
i
always
love
you
i
love
you
too
she
smiled
and
kissed
me
we
be
together
con
that
all
that
matters
we
be
together
that
was
important
and
it
made
me
feel
good
yes
we
be
together
i
see
to
that
but
for
a
while
barbara
would
hate
me
through
all
the
long
years
of
the
indoctrination
someday
perhaps
she
would
understand
the
indoctrination
could
do
it
and
i
could
help
but
by
the
gods
of
space
how
would
it
be
to
take
that
hate
all
that
while
we
came
out
into
the
central
chamber
where
the
prisoners
were
gathering
to
be
herded
up
to
the
ships
armed
valgolian
guards
stood
under
the
glare
of
improvised
lights
other
imperials
were
going
through
the
city
flushing
out
those
who
might
be
hiding
and
removing
whatever
our
armed
forces
could
use
the
equipment
would
do
no
one
any
good
here
and
boreas
would
be
left
to
its
darkness
it
was
cold
in
the
vast
shadowy
room
the
heating
plant
had
broken
down
and
the
ancient
cold
of
boreas
was
seeping
in
barbara
shivered
and
i
held
her
close
to
me
nat
hawkins
moved
over
to
join
us
wordlessly
i
was
questioned
in
a
locked
room
by
one
of
the
big
valgolian
officers
he
looked
at
a
stereograph
in
his
hand
and
he
took
me
aside
but
it
was
not
unusual
many
of
the
starbound
prisoners
were
being
questioned
by
their
guards
and
i
was
merely
one
of
them
colonel
halgan
the
officer
asked
with
an
eagerness
close
to
he
was
obviously
fresh
from
school
and
military
terminology
came
from
his
lips
as
if
it
really
meant
something
to
a
valgolian
the
colonel
of
course
meant
that
in
a
titular
sense
i
had
been
elevated
for
my
work
funny
if
you
use
the
language
enough
you
get
to
believe
it
yourself
sir
the
young
officer
continued
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
pieces
of
work
i
ever
seen
i
am
to
extend
the
official
congratulations
of
i
let
him
talk
for
a
while
and
then
i
raised
my
hand
peremptorily
and
i
told
him
that
the
girl
with
the
earthling
hawkins
was
to
go
along
for
indoctrination
despite
the
fact
that
her
name
did
not
appear
on
his
lists
he
nodded
and
i
went
back
to
barbara
but
half
a
dozen
men
had
come
between
us
levinsohn
and
five
guards
the
man
carriage
was
still
erect
the
old
unbreakable
pride
and
courage
were
still
in
him
someone
among
the
prisoners
broke
loose
and
rushed
at
him
cursing
till
the
valgolians
thrust
him
back
into
line
levinsohn
screamed
the
man
levinsohn
you
dirty
jew
you
sold
us
out
there
you
see
why
this
rebellion
had
to
be
crushed
earth
still
had
a
long
way
to
go
the
levinsohns
the
barbaras
the
more
promising
of
the
anarchs
would
be
educated
and
returned
and
the
civilizing
process
would
go
on
earth
best
and
bravest
would
unite
and
fight
us
and
with
each
defeat
they
would
learn
something
of
what
we
had
to
teach
them
that
all
races
however
divergent
must
respect
each
other
and
work
together
learn
it
with
an
intensity
which
the
merely
intellectual
teaching
of
schools
and
propaganda
could
not
achieve
alone
or
at
any
rate
soon
enough
valgolia
is
the
great
and
lonely
enemy
the
devil
since
none
of
us
can
be
angels
it
is
the
source
of
challenge
and
adversity
such
as
has
always
driven
intelligence
onward
and
upward
in
spite
of
itself
sooner
or
later
generations
hence
perhaps
all
the
subject
worlds
will
have
attained
internal
unity
forgetting
their
very
species
in
a
common
bond
of
intelligence
and
on
that
day
valgolia
work
will
be
done
she
and
her
few
friends
her
will
seemingly
capitulate
without
a
fight
and
become
simply
part
of
a
union
of
free
and
truly
civilized
planets
and
such
a
union
will
be
firmer
and
more
enduring
than
all
the
tyrant
empires
of
the
past
it
will
have
the
strength
of
a
thousand
or
more
races
working
together
in
the
harmony
which
they
achieved
in
struggling
against
us
that
is
the
goal
but
it
is
a
long
way
ahead
there
may
be
centuries
needed
and
meanwhile
valgolia
is
alone
barbara
would
understand
in
time
she
would
understand
what
she
as
yet
did
not
even
know
but
first
would
be
the
hatred
the
cold
stark
hatred
that
must
come
of
knowing
who
and
what
i
really
am
i
could
only
wait
for
that
hatred
to
come
after
she
learned
and
then
wait
for
it
to
go
slowly
slowly
lines
of
the
earthlings
were
filing
forward
and
with
nat
hawkins
barbara
waited
for
me
i
walked
to
her
and
took
her
hand
her
head
was
high
as
high
as
levinsohn
she
expected
all
of
us
to
die
but
meet
the
relatives
and
friends
she
thought
were
dead
it
would
be
a
great
a
crushing
humiliation
to
know
one
martyrs
were
alive
and
being
well
treated
and
intensively
educated
by
the
foe
who
was
supporting
and
encouraging
one
supposedly
dangerous
revolution
it
wo
be
so
bad
as
long
as
we
together
darling
i
said
she
smiled
misunderstanding
and
kissed
me
defiantly
before
our
valgolian
guards
