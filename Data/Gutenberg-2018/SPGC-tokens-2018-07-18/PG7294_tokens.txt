translation
of
a
letter
from
marshal
foch
to
major
general
greely
dated
malsherbe
october
my
dear
general
colonel
ardant
du
picq
was
the
exponent
of
the
most
powerful
element
in
the
strength
of
armies
he
has
shown
it
to
be
the
preponderating
influence
in
the
outcome
of
battles
your
son
has
accomplished
a
very
valuable
work
in
translating
his
writings
one
finds
his
conclusions
amply
verified
in
the
experience
of
the
american
army
during
the
last
war
notably
in
the
campaign
of
accept
my
dear
general
my
best

foch
preface
by
frank
simonds
author
of
history
of
the
world
war
shall
not
pass
verdun
etc
in
presenting
to
the
american
reading
public
a
translation
of
a
volume
written
by
an
obscure
french
colonel
belonging
to
a
defeated
army
who
fell
on
the
eve
of
a
battle
which
not
alone
gave
france
over
to
the
enemy
but
disclosed
a
leadership
so
inapt
as
to
awaken
the
suspicion
of
treason
one
is
faced
by
the
inevitable
interrogation
why
yet
the
answer
is
simple
the
value
of
the
book
of
ardant
du
picq
lies
precisely
in
the
fact
that
it
contains
not
alone
the
unmistakable
forecast
of
the
defeat
itself
but
a
luminous
statement
of
those
fundamental
principles
the
neglect
of
which
led
to
gravelotte
and
sedan
napoleon
has
said
that
in
war
the
moral
element
is
to
all
others
as
three
is
to
one
moreover
as
du
picq
impressively
demonstrates
while
all
other
circumstances
change
with
time
the
human
element
remains
the
same
capable
of
just
so
much
endurance
sacrifice
effort
and
no
more
thus
from
caesar
to
foch
the
essential
factor
in
war
endures
unmodified
and
it
is
not
the
value
of
du
picq
book
as
an
explanation
of
the
disasters
of
but
of
the
triumphs
of
which
gives
it
present
and
permanent
interest
it
is
not
as
the
forecast
of
why
bazaine
a
type
of
all
french
commanders
of
the
war
will
fail
but
why
foch
joffre
pétain
will
succeed
that
the
volume
invites
reading
beyond
all
else
the
arresting
circumstances
in
the
fragmentary
pages
perfect
in
themselves
but
incomplete
in
the
conception
of
their
author
is
the
intellectual
and
the
moral
kinship
they
reveal
between
the
soldier
who
fell
just
before
the
crowning
humiliation
of
gravelotte
and
the
victor
of
fère
champenoise
the
yser
and
the
colossal
conflict
of
to
which
historians
have
already
applied
the
name
of
the
battle
of
france
rightly
to
suggest
its
magnitude
read
the
hastily
compiled
lectures
of
foch
the
teacher
of
the
école
de
guerre
recall
the
fugitive
but
impressive
words
of
foch
the
soldier
uttered
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
filled
with
homely
phrase
and
piquant
figure
and
underlying
all
one
encounters
the
same
integral
conception
of
war
and
of
the
relation
of
the
moral
to
the
physical
which
fills
the
all
too
scanty
pages
of
du
picq
for
me
as
a
soldier
writes
du
picq
the
smallest
detail
caught
on
the
spot
and
in
the
heat
of
action
is
more
instructive
than
all
the
thiers
and
the
jominis
in
the
world
compare
this
with
foch
explaining
to
his
friend
andré
de
mariecourt
his
own
emotions
at
the
critical
hour
at
fère
champenoise
when
he
had
to
invent
something
new
to
beguile
soldiers
who
had
retreated
for
weeks
and
been
beaten
for
days
his
tactical
problem
remained
unchanged
but
he
must
give
his
soldiers
tired
with
being
beaten
to
the
old
tune
a
new
air
which
would
appeal
to
them
as
new
something
to
which
they
had
not
been
beaten
and
the
same
philosophy
appears
du
picq
contemporaries
neglected
his
warning
they
saw
only
the
outward
circumstances
of
the
napoleonic
and
frederican
successes
in
vain
du
picq
warned
them
that
the
victories
of
frederick
were
not
the
logical
outgrowth
of
the
minutiae
of
the
potsdam
parades
but
du
picq
dead
the
third
empire
fallen
france
prostrated
but
not
annihilated
by
the
defeats
of
a
new
generation
emerged
of
which
foch
was
but
the
last
and
most
shining
example
and
this
generation
went
back
powerfully
aided
by
the
words
of
du
picq
to
that
older
tradition
to
the
immutable
principles
of
war
with
surprising
exactness
du
picq
speaking
in
the
abstract
foretold
an
engagement
in
which
the
mistakes
of
the
enemy
would
be
counterbalanced
by
their
energy
in
the
face
of
french
passivity
lack
of
any
control
conception
forty
years
later
in
the
école
de
guerre
foch
explained
the
reasons
why
the
strategy
of
moltke
mistaken
in
all
respects
failed
to
meet
the
ruin
it
deserved
only
because
at
gravelotte
bazaine
could
not
make
up
his
mind
solely
because
of
the
absence
in
french
high
command
of
precisely
that
creed
of
combat
the
lack
of
which
du
picq
deplored
of
the
value
of
du
picq
work
to
the
professional
soldier
i
naturally
can
not
speak
but
even
for
the
civilian
the
student
of
military
events
of
war
and
of
the
larger
as
well
as
the
smaller
circumstances
of
battle
its
usefulness
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
reading
it
one
understands
something
at
least
of
the
soul
as
well
as
the
science
of
combat
the
great
defeats
and
the
great
victories
of
history
seem
more
intelligible
in
simple
terms
of
human
beings
beyond
this
lies
the
contemporaneous
value
due
to
the
fact
that
nowhere
can
one
better
understand
foch
than
through
the
reading
of
du
picq
by
translating
this
volume
of
du
picq
and
thus
making
it
available
for
an
american
audience
whose
interest
has
been
inevitably
stirred
by
recent
events
the
translators
have
done
a
public
as
well
as
a
professional
service
both
officers
enjoyed
exceptional
opportunities
and
experiences
on
the
western
front
greely
from
cantigny
to
the
close
of
the
battle
of
the
was
not
only
frequently
associated
with
the
french
army
but
as
chief
of
staff
of
our
own
first
division
gained
a
direct
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
battle
equal
to
that
of
du
picq
himself
on
the
professional
side
the
service
is
obvious
since
before
the
last
war
the
weakness
of
the
american
like
the
british
army
a
weakness
inevitable
given
our
isolation
lay
in
the
absence
of
adequate
study
of
the
higher
branches
of
military
science
and
thus
the
absence
of
such
a
body
of
highly
skilled
professional
soldiers
as
constituted
the
french
or
german
general
staff
the
present
volume
is
a
clear
evidence
that
american
officers
themselves
have
voluntarily
undertaken
to
make
good
this
lack
on
the
side
and
for
the
general
reader
the
service
is
hardly
less
considerable
since
it
supplies
the
least
technically
informed
with
a
simply
comprehensible
explanation
of
things
which
almost
every
one
has
struggled
to
grasp
and
visualize
during
the
last
six
years
extending
from
the
battle
of
marne
in
to
that
of
the
vistula
in
of
the
truth
of
this
latter
assertion
a
single
example
will
perhaps
suffice
every
forthcoming
military
study
of
the
campaign
of
emphasizes
with
renewed
energy
the
fact
that
underlying
all
the
german
conceptions
of
the
opening
operations
was
the
purpose
to
repeat
the
achievement
of
hannibal
at
cannae
by
bringing
the
french
to
battle
under
conditions
which
should
on
a
colossal
scale
reproduce
those
of
hannibal
greatest
victory
but
nowhere
better
than
in
du
volume
are
set
forth
the
essential
circumstances
of
the
combat
which
after
two
thousand
years
gave
to
field
marshal
von
schlieffen
the
root
ideas
for
the
strategy
expressed
in
the
first
six
weeks
of
and
as
a
final
observation
nowhere
better
than
in
du
picq
account
can
one
find
the
explanation
of
why
the
younger
moltke
failed
in
executing
those
plans
which
gave
hannibal
one
of
the
most
shining
triumphs
in
all
antiquity
thus
although
he
died
in
du
picq
lives
through
his
book
as
one
of
the
most
useful
guides
to
a
proper
understanding

read

by
such

as
have
chanced
upon
it
probably
only
the
scarcity
of
thinking
men
with

has
precluded
the
earlier
appearance
of
an
american

the

feel
that
the
war
with

which
brought
with
it
some
military
training
for
all
the
best
brains
of
the

has
prepared

are
sure
that
every

will
at

a
second

was
called
for
after
a
considerable
time
it
has
left
ineffaceable
traces
in
the
minds
of
thinking
men
with
experience
by
its
beauty
and
the
vigor
of
its
teachings
it
has
created
in
a
faithful
school
of

a
tradition
of
correct
ideas

familiar
with
the
work
there
is
no

the
importance
and
usefulness
of
this
rejuvenated
publication
in
it
they
will
find
new
sources
of
interest
which
will
confirm
their
admiration
for
the
author
they
will
also
rejoice
in
the
popularity
of
their
teacher
already
highly
regarded
in
the
eyes
of
his
profession
on
account
of
his
presentation
of
conclusions
the
truth
of
which
grows
with
years
his
work
merits
widespread
attention
it
would
be
an
error
to
leave
it
in
the
exclusive
possession
of
special
writers
and
military
technicians
in

which
is
equal
in
power
and
pathetic
beauty
it

carry
its
light
much
further
and
address
itself
to
all

without

be

the
strong

substantial
intellect

no
one

fail
to
feel
their
profound
depths

facilitate

ourselves
to
a

its
essential
elements

general
conception
that
unites
them
and
the
purpose
of
the
author
but
we
must
not
forget
the
dramatic
mutilation
of
the
work
unfortunately
never
completed

of
the
glorious
death
of
ardant

when

never

that
he
had
done
away
with
one
of
the
most
intelligent
officers
of
our

one
of
the
most
forceful
writers
one
of
the
most
philosophers

was

evidence
of

were
perishing

the
lack
of

the

discredited
cult

frequently
in

virtues
are
forsaken
during
long
periods
when
it
seems
that
the
entire

is
hopelessly
abased
the
mass
perceives
too
late
in
rare

certain
wasted
talents

and
almost
supernatural

such

are

decadence
and
mental
laxness
they
inherit
all
the
qualities
that
have
long
since

examples
and

and

on
reading
over
the
extraordinary
work
of
ardant
du
picq
that
brilliant
star
in
the
eclipse
of
our
military
faculties
i
think
of
the
fatal
shot
that
carried
him
off
before
full
use
had
been
found
for
him
and
i
am
struck
by
melancholy
our
fall
appears
more
poignant
his
premature
end
seems
a
punishment
for
his
contemporaries
a
bitter
but
just
reproach
fortunately
more
honored
and
believed
in
by
his
successors
his
once
unappreciated
teaching
contributes
largely
to
the
uplift
and
to
the
education
of
our
officers
they
will
be
inspired
by
his
original
views
and
the
permanent
virtue
contained
therein
they
will
learn
therefrom
the
art
of
leading
and
training
our
young
soldiers
and
can
hope
to
retrieve
the
cruel
losses
of
their
predecessors
ardant
du
picq
amazes
one
by
his
tenacity
and
will
power
which
without
the
least
support
from
the
outside
animate
him
under
the
trying
conditions
of
his
period
of
isolated
effort
in
an
army
in
which
most
of
the
seniors
disdained
the
future
and
neglected
their
responsibilities
rested
satisfied
on
the
laurels
of
former
campaigns
and
relied
on
superannuated
theories
and
the
exercises
of
a
poor
parade
scorned
foreign
organizations
and
believed
in
an
acquired
and
constant
superiority
that
dispenses
with
all
work
and
did
not
suspect
even
the
radical
transformations
which
the
development
of
rifles
and
artillery
entail
ardant
du
picq
worked
for
the
common
good
in
his
modest
retreat
far
from
the
pinnacles
of
glory
he
tended
a
solitary
shrine
of
unceasing
activity
and
noble
effort
he
burned
with
the
passions
which
ought
to
have
moved
the
staff
and
higher
commanders
he
watched
while
his
contemporaries
slept
toward
the
existing
system
of
instruction
and
preparation
which
the
first
blow
shattered
his
incorruptible
honesty
prevented
him
from
being
indulgent
while
terrified
leaders
passed
from
arrogance
or
thoughtlessness
to
dejection
and
confusion
the
blow
was
being
struck
served
by
his
marvelous
historical
gifts
he
studied
the
laws
of
ancient
combat
in
the
poorly
interpreted
but
innumerable
documents
of
the
past
then
guided
by
the
immortal
light
which
never
failed
the
feverish
curiosity
of
this
soldier
mind
turned
towards
the
research
of
the
laws
of
modern
combat
the
subject
of
his
preference
in
this
study
he
developed
to
perfection
his
psychological
attainments
by
the
use
of
these
attainments
he
simplified
the
theory
of
the
conduct
of
war
by
dissecting
the
motor
nerves
of
the
human
heart
he
released
basic
data
on
the
essential
principles
of
combat
he
discovered
the
secret
of
combat
the
way
to
victory
never
for
a
second
did
ardant
du
picq
forget
that
combat
is
the
object
the
cause
of
being
the
supreme
manifestation
of
armies
every
measure
which
departs
therefrom
which
relegates
it
to
the
middle
ground
is
deceitful
chimerical
fatal
all
the
resources
accumulated
in
time
of
peace
all
the
tactical
evolutions
all
the
strategical
calculations
are
but
conveniences
drills
reference
marks
to
lead
up
to
it
his
obsession
was
so
overpowering
that
his
presentation
of
it
will
last
as
long
as
history
this
obsession
is
the
rôle
of
man
in
combat
man
is
the
incomparable
instrument
whose
elements
character
energies
sentiments
fears
desires
and
instincts
are
stronger
than
all
abstract
rules
than
all
bookish
theories
war
is
still
more
of
an
art
than
a
science
the
inspirations
which
reveal
and
mark
the
great
strategists
the
leaders
of
men
form
the
unforeseen
element
the
divine
part
generals
of
genius
draw
from
the
human
heart
ability
to
execute
a
surprising
variety
of
movements
which
vary
the
routine
the
mediocre
ones
who
have
no
eyes
to
read
readily
therein
are
doomed
to
the
worst
errors
ardant
du
picq
haunted
by
the
need
of
a
doctrine
which
would
correct
existing
evils
and
disorders
was
continually
returning
to
the
anxious
to
instruct
promising
officers
to
temper
them
by
irrefutable
lessons
to
mature
them
more
rapidly
to
inspire
them
with
his
zeal
for
historical
incidents
he
resolved
to
carry
on
and
add
to
his
personal
studies
while
aiding
them
daring
to
take
a
courageous
offensive
against
the
general
inertia
of
the
period
he
translated
the
problem
of
his
whole
life
into
a
series
of
basic
questions
he
presented
in
their
most
diverse
aspects
the
basic
questions
which
perplex
all
military
men
those
of
which
knowledge
in
a
varying
degree
of
perfection
distinguish
and
classify
military
men
the
nervous
grasp
of
an
incomparable
style
models
each
of
them
carves
them
with
a
certain
harshness
communicates
to
them
a
fascinating
yet
unknown
authority
which
crystallizes
them
in
the
mind
at
the
same
time
giving
to
them
a
positive
form
that
remains
true
for
all
armies
for
all
past
present
and
future
centuries
herewith
is
the
text
of
the
concise
and
pressing
questions
which
have
not
ceased
to
be
as
important
as
they
were
in
in
the
last
century
after
the
improvements
of
the
rifle
and
field
artillery
by
frederick
and
the
prussian
successes
in
war
after
the
improvement
of
the
new
rifle
and
cannon
to
which
in
part
the
recent
victories
are
due
we
find
all
thinking
men
in
the
army
asking
themselves
the
question
shall
we
fight
we
have
no
creed
on
the
subject
of
combat
and
the
most
opposing
methods
confuse
the
intelligence
of
military
men
why
a
common
error
at
the
starting
point
one
might
say
that
no
one
is
willing
to
acknowledge
that
it
is
necessary
to
understand
yesterday
in
order
to
know
for
the
things
of
yesterday
are
nowhere
plainly
written
the
lessons
of
yesterday
exist
solely
in
the
memory
of
those
who
know
how
to
remember
because
they
have
known
how
to
see
and
those
individuals
have
never
spoken
i
make
an
appeal
to
one
of
those
the
smallest
detail
taken
from
an
actual
incident
in
war
is
more
instructive
for
me
a
soldier
than
all
the
thiers
and
jominis
in
the
world
they
speak
no
doubt
for
the
heads
of
states
and
armies
but
they
never
show
me
what
i
wish
to
know
a
battalion
a
company
a
squad
in
action
concerning
a
regiment
a
battalion
a
company
a
squad
it
is
interesting
to
know
the
disposition
taken
to
meet
the
enemy
or
the
order
for
the
march
toward
them
what
becomes
of
this
disposition
or
this
march
order
under
the
isolated
or
combined
influences
of
accidents
of
the
terrain
and
the
approach
of
danger
is
this
order
changed
or
is
it
continued
in
force
when
approaching
the
enemy
what
becomes
of
it
upon
arriving
within
the
range
of
the
guns
within
the
range
of
bullets
at
what
distance
is
a
voluntary
or
an
ordered
disposition
taken
before
starting
operations
for
commencing
fire
for
charging
or
both
how
did
the
fight
start
how
about
the
firing
how
did
the
men
adapt
themselves
this
may
be
learned
from
the
results
so
many
bullets
fired
so
many
men
shot
down
when
such
data
are
available
how
was
the
charge
made
at
what
distance
did
the
enemy
flee
before
it
at
what
distance
did
the
charge
fall
back
before
the
fire
or
the
good
order
and
good
dispositions
of
the
enemy
or
before
such
and
such
a
movement
of
the
enemy
what
did
it
cost
what
can
be
said
about
all
these
with
reference
to
the
enemy
the
behavior
the
order
the
disorder
the
shouts
the
silence
the
confusion
the
calmness
of
the
officers
and
men
whether
with
us
or
with
the
enemy
before
during
and
after
the
combat
how
has
the
soldier
been
controlled
and
directed
during
the
action
at
what
instant
has
he
had
a
tendency
to
quit
the
line
in
order
to
remain
behind
or
to
rush
ahead
at
what
moment
if
the
control
were
escaping
from
the
leader
hands
has
it
no
longer
been
possible
to
exercise
it
at
what
instant
has
this
control
escaped
from
the
battalion
commander
when
from
the
captain
the
section
leader
the
squad
leader
at
what
time
in
short
if
such
a
thing
did
take
place
was
there
but
a
disordered
impulse
whether
to
the
front
or
to
the
rear
carrying
along
with
it
both
the
leaders
and
men
where
and
when
did
the
halt
take
place
where
and
when
were
the
leaders
able
to
resume
control
of
the
men
at
what
moments
before
during
or
after
the
day
was
the
battalion
the
company
made
the
results
of
these
how
many
dead
how
many
wounded
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
the
kind
of
wounds
of
the
officers
officers
corporals
privates
all
these
details
in
a
word
enlighten
either
the
material
or
the
moral
side
of
the
action
or
enable
it
to
be
visualized
possibly
a
closer
examination
might
show
that
they
are
matters
infinitely
more
instructive
to
us
as
soldiers
than
all
the
discussions
imaginable
on
the
plans
and
general
conduct
of
the
campaigns
of
the
greatest
captain
in
the
great
movements
of
the
battle
field
from
colonel
to
private
we
are
soldiers
not
generals
and
it
is
therefore
our
trade
that
we
desire
to
know
certainly
one
can
not
obtain
all
the
details
of
the
same
incident
but
from
a
series
of
true
accounts
there
should
emanate
an
ensemble
of
characteristic
details
which
in
themselves
are
very
apt
to
show
in
a
striking
irrefutable
way
what
was
necessarily
and
forcibly
taking
place
at
such
and
such
a
moment
of
an
action
in
war
take
the
estimate
of
the
soldier
obtained
in
this
manner
to
serve
as
a
base
for
what
might
possibly
be
a
rational
method
of
fighting
it
will
put
us
on
guard
against
and
pedantic
school
methods
whoever
has
seen
turns
to
a
method
based
on
his
knowledge
his
personal
experience
as
a
soldier
but
experience
is
long
and
life
is
short
the
experiences
of
each
can
not
therefore
be
completed
except
by
those
of
others
and
that
is
why
general
i
venture
to
address
myself
to
you
for
your
experiences
proofs
have
weight
as
for
the
rest
whether
it
please
you
to
aid
or
not
general
kindly
accept
the
assurance
of
most
respectful
devotion
from
your
obedient
servant
the
reading
of
this
unique
document
is
sufficient
to
explain
the
glory
that
ardant
du
picq
deserved
in
no
other
career
has
a
professional
ever
reflected
more
clearly
the
means
of
pushing
his
profession
to
perfection
in
no
profession
has
a
deeper
penetration
of
the
resources
been
made
it
pleases
me
particularly
to
associate
the
two
words
and
which
at
the
present
time
the
ignorance
of
preconceived
opinion
too
frequently
separates
because
such
opinion
is
on
the
verge
of
believing
them
to
be
incompatible
and
contradictory
yet
no
calling
other
than
the
true
military
profession
is
so
fitted
to
excite
brain
activity
it
is
preëminently
the
calling
of
action
at
the
same
time
diverse
in
its
combinations
and
changing
according
to
the
time
and
locality
wherein
it
is
put
to
practice
no
other
profession
is
more
complex
nor
more
difficult
since
it
has
for
its
aim
and
reason
the
instruction
of
men
to
overcome
by
training
and
endurance
the
fatigue
and
perils
against
which
the
voice
of
is
raised
in
fear
in
other
words
to
draw
from
nature
what
is
most
opposed
and
most
antipathic
to
this
nature
there
is
however
much
of
routine
in
the
customs
of
military
life
and
abuse
of
it
may
bring
about
gross
satires
which
in
turn
bring
it
into
derision
to
be
sure
the
career
has
two
phases
because
it
must
fulfill
simultaneously
two
exigencies
from
this
persons
of
moderate
capacity
draw
back
and
are
horrified
they
solve
the
question
by
the
sacrifice
of
the
one
or
the
other
if
one
considers
only
the
lower
and
somewhat
vulgar
aspect
of
military
life
it
is
found
to
be
composed
of
monotonous
obligations
clothed
in
a
mechanical
procedure
of
indispensable
repetition
if
one
learns
to
grasp
it
in
its
ensemble
and
large
perspective
it
will
be
found
that
the
days
of
extreme
trial
demand
prodigies
of
vigor
spirit
intelligence
and
decision
regarded
from
this
angle
and
supported
in
this
light
the
commonplace
things
of
wearisome
garrison
life
have
as
counterweights
certain
sublime
compensations
these
compensations
preclude
the
false
and
contemptible
results
which
come
from
intellectual
idleness
and
the
habit
of
absolute
submission
if
it
yields
to
their
narcotic
charms
the
best
brain
grows
rusty
and
atrophies
in
the
long
run
incapable
of
virile
labor
it
rebels
at
a
renewal
of
its
processes
in
sane
initiative
an
army
in
which
vigilance
is
not
perpetual
is
sick
until
the
enemy
demonstrates
it
to
be
dead
far
then
from
attaching
routine
as
an
indispensable
companion
to
military
discipline
it
must
be
shown
continually
that
in
it
lies
destruction
and
loss
military
discipline
does
not
degenerate
except
when
it
has
not
known
the
cult
of
its
vitality
and
the
secret
of
its
grandeur
the
teachers
of
war
have
all
placed
this
truth
as
a
preface
to
their
triumphs
and
we
find
the
most
illustrious
teachers
to
be
the
most
severe
listen
to
this
critique
of
frederick
the
great
on
the
maneuvers
which
he
conducted
in
silesia
the
great
mistake
in
inspections
is
that
you
officers
amuse
yourselves
with
god
knows
what
buffooneries
and
never
dream
in
the
least
of
serious
service
this
is
a
source
of
stupidity
which
would
become
most
dangerous
in
case
of
a
serious
conflict
take
and
tailors
and
make
generals
of
them
and
they
will
not
commit
worse
follies
these
blunders
are
made
on
a
small
as
well
as
on
a
large
scale
consequently
in
the
greatest
number
of
regiments
the
private
is
not
well
trained
in
zaramba
regiment
he
is
the
worst
in
thadden
he
amounts
to
nothing
and
to
no
more
in
keller
erlach
and
haager
why
because
the
officers
are
lazy
and
try
to
get
out
of
a
difficulty
by
giving
themselves
the
least
trouble
possible
in
default
of
exceptional
generals
who
remold
in
some
campaigns
with
a
superb
stroke
the
damaged
or
untempered
military
metal
it
is
of
importance
to
supply
it
with
the
ideals
of
ardant
du
picq
those
who
are
formed
by
his
image
by
his
book
will
never
fall
into
error
his
book
has
not
been
written
to
please
aesthetic
preciseness
but
with
a
sincerity
which
knows
no
limit
it
therefore
contains
irrefutable
facts
and
theories
the
solidity
of
these
fragmentary
pages
defies
time
the
work
interrupted
by
the
german
shell
is
none
the
less
erected
for
eternity
the
work
has
muscles
nerves
and
a
soul
it
has
the
transparent
concentration
of
reality
a
thought
may
be
expressed
by
a
single
word
the
terseness
of
the
calcined
phrase
explains
the
interior
fire
of
it
all
the
magnificent
conviction
of
the
author
the
distinctness
of
outline
the
most
astounding
brevity
of
touch
is
such
that
the
vision
of
the
future
bursts
forth
from
the
resurrection
of
the
past
the
work
contains
indeed
substance
and
marrow
of
a
prophetic
experience
amidst
the
praise
rendered
to
the
scintillating
beauties
of
this
book
there
is
perhaps
none
more
impressive
than
that
of
barbey
an
illustrious
literary
man
of
a
long
and
generous
patrician
lineage
his
comment
kindled
with
lyric
enthusiasm
is
illuminating
it
far
surpasses
the
usual
narrow
conception
of
technical
subjects
confessing
his
professional
ignorance
in
matters
of
war
his
sincere
eulogy
of
the
eloquent
amateur
is
therefore
only
the
more
irresistible
never
writes
barbey
has
a
man
of
action
of
brutal
action
in
the
eyes
of
universal
prejudice
more
magnificently
glorified
the
spirituality
of
war
mechanics
abominable
mechanics
takes
possession
of
the
world
crushing
it
under
its
stupid
and
irresistible
wheels
by
the
action
of
newly
discovered
and
improved
appliances
the
science
of
war
assumes
vast
proportions
as
a
means
of
destruction
yet
here
amid
the
din
of
this
upset
modern
world
we
find
a
brain
sufficiently
master
of
its
own
thoughts
as
not
to
permit
itself
to
be
dominated
by
these
horrible
discoveries
which
we
are
told
would
make
impossible
fredericks
of
prussia
and
napoleons
and
lower
them
to
the
level
of
the
private
soldier
colonel
ardant
du
picq
tells
us
somewhere
that
he
has
never
had
entire
faith
in
the
huge
battalions
which
these
two
great
men
themselves
alone
worth
more
than
the
largest
battalions
believed
in
well
this
vigorous
brain
believes
no
more
in
the
mechanical
or
mathematical
force
which
is
going
to
abolish
these
great
battalions
a
calculator
without
the
least
emotion
who
considers
the
mind
of
man
the
essential
in
war
because
it
is
this
mind
that
makes
war
he
surely
sees
better
than
anybody
else
a
profound
change
in
the
exterior
conditions
of
war
which
he
must
consider
but
the
spiritual
conditions
which
are
produced
in
war
have
not
changed
such
is
the
eternal
mind
of
man
raised
to
its
highest
power
by
discipline
such
is
the
roman
cement
of
this
discipline
that
makes
of
men
indestructible
walls
such
is
the
cohesion
the
solidarity
between
men
and
their
leaders
such
is
the
moral
influence
of
the
impulse
which
gives
the
certainty
of
victory
conquer
is
to
advance
de
maistre
said
one
day
puzzled
at
this
phenomenon
of
victory
the
author
of
etudes
sur
le
combat
says
more
simply
conquer
is
to
be
sure
to
overcome
in
fine
it
is
the
mind
that
wins
battles
that
will
always
win
them
that
always
has
won
them
throughout
the
world
history
the
spirituality
the
moral
quality
of
war
has
not
changed
since
those
times
mechanics
modern
arms
all
the
artillery
invented
by
man
and
his
science
will
not
make
an
end
to
this
thing
so
lightly
considered
at
the
moment
and
called
the
human
soul
books
like
that
of
ardant
du
picq
prevent
it
from
being
disdained
if
no
other
effect
should
be
produced
by
this
sublime
book
this
one
thing
would
justify
it
but
there
will
be
others
do
not
doubt
it
i
wish
merely
to
point
out
the
sublimity
of
this
didactic
book
which
for
me
has
wings
like
celestial
poetry
and
which
has
carried
me
above
and
far
away
from
the
materialistic
abjectness
of
my
time
the
technique
of
tactics
and
the
science
of
war
are
beyond
my
province
i
am
not
like
the
author
erudite
on
maneuvers
and
the
battle
field
but
despite
my
ignorance
of
things
exclusively
military
i
have
felt
the
truth
of
the
imperious
demonstrations
with
which
it
is
replete
as
one
feels
the
presence
of
the
sun
behind
a
cloud
his
book
has
over
the
reader
that
moral
ascendancy
which
is
everything
in
war
and
which
determines
success
according
to
the
author
this
ascendancy
like
truth
itself
is
the
sort
which
can
not
be
questioned
coming
from
the
superior
mind
of
a
leader
who
inspires
faith
it
imposes
obedience
by
its
very
strength
colonel
ardant
du
picq
was
a
military
writer
only
with
a
style
of
his
own
he
has
the
latin
brevity
and
concentration
he
retains
his
thought
assembles
it
and
always
puts
it
out
in
a
compact
phrase
like
a
cartridge
his
style
has
the
rapidity
and
precision
of
the
arms
which
have
dethroned
the
bayonet
he
would
have
been
a
writer
anywhere
he
was
a
writer
by
nature
he
was
of
that
sacred
phalanx
of
those
who
have
a
style
all
to
themselves
barbey
rebels
against
tedious
technicalities
carried
away
by
the
author
historical
and
philosophical
faculties
he
soars
without
difficulty
to
the
plane
of
ardant
du
picq
in
like
manner
du
picq
ranges
easily
from
the
most
mediocre
military
operations
to
the
analysis
of
the
great
functions
of
policy
of
government
and
the
evolution
of
nations
who
could
have
unraveled
with
greater
finesse
the
causes
of
the
insatiable
desires
of
conquest
by
the
new
power
which
was
so
desirous
of
occupying
the
leading
rôle
on
the
world
stage
if
our
diplomats
our
ministers
and
our
generals
had
seized
the
warning
of
the
date
of
the
defeat
of
austria
it
is
possible
that
we
might
have
been
spared
our
own
defeats
has
an
aristocracy
any
excuse
for
existing
if
it
is
not
military
no
the
prussian
aristocracy
is
essentially
military
in
its
ranks
it
does
accept
officers
of
plebeian
extraction
but
only
under
condition
that
they
permit
themselves
to
be
absorbed
therein
is
not
an
aristocracy
essentially
proud
if
it
were
not
proud
it
would
lack
confidence
the
prussian
aristocracy
is
therefore
haughty
it
desires
domination
by
force
and
its
desire
to
rule
to
dominate
more
and
more
is
the
essence
of
its
existence
it
rules
by
war
it
wishes
war
it
must
have
war
at
the
proper
time
its
leaders
have
the
good
judgment
to
choose
the
right
moment
this
love
of
war
is
in
the
very
fiber
the
very
makeup
of
its
life
as
an
aristocracy
every
nation
that
has
an
aristocracy
a
military
nobility
is
organized
in
a
military
way
the
prussian
officer
is
an
accomplished
gentleman
and
nobleman
by
instruction
or
examination
he
is
most
capable
by
education
most
worthy
he
is
an
officer
and
commands
from
two
motives
the
french
officer
from
one
alone
prussia
in
spite
of
all
the
veils
concealing
reality
is
a
military
organization
conducted
by
a
military
corporation
a
nation
democratically
constituted
is
not
organized
from
a
military
point
of
view
it
is
therefore
as
against
the
other
in
a
state
of
unpreparedness
for
war
a
military
nation
and
a
warlike
nation
are
not
necessarily
the
same
the
french
are
warlike
from
organization
and
instinct
they
are
every
day
becoming
less
and
less
military
in
being
the
neighbor
of
a
military
nation
there
is
no
security
for
a
democratic
nation
the
two
are
born
enemies
the
one
continually
menaces
the
good
influences
if
not
the
very
existence
of
the
other
as
long
as
prussia
is
not
democratic
she
is
a
menace
to
us
the
future
seems
to
belong
to
democracy
but
before
this
future
is
attained
by
europe
who
will
say
that
victory
and
domination
will
not
belong
for
a
time
to
military
organization
it
will
presently
perish
for
the
lack
of
sustenance
of
life
when
having
no
more
foreign
enemies
to
vanquish
to
watch
to
fight
for
control
it
will
have
no
reason
for
existence
in
tracing
a
portrait
so
much
resembling
bellicose
and
conquering
prussia
the
sharp
eye
of
ardant
du
picq
had
recognized
clearly
the
danger
which
immediately
threatened
us
and
which
his
deluded
and
trifling
fellow
citizens
did
not
even
suspect
the
morning
after
sadowa
not
a
single
statesman
or
publicist
had
yet
divined
what
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
of
the
line
had
at
first
sight
understood
written
before
the
catastrophes
of
froeschwiller
metz
and
sedan
the
fragment
seems
in
a
retrospective
way
an
implacable
accusation
against
those
who
deceived
themselves
about
the
hohenzollern
country
by
false
liberalism
or
a
softening
of
the
brain
unswerved
by
popular
ideas
by
the
artificial
by
the
trifles
of
treaties
by
the
chimera
of
theories
by
the
charlatanism
of
bulletins
by
the
nonsense
of
romantic
fiction
by
the
sentimentalities
of
vain
chivalry
ardant
du
picq
triumphant
in
history
is
even
more
the
incomparable
master
in
the
field
of
his
laborious
days
and
nights
the
field
of
war
itself
never
has
a
clearer
vision
fathomed
the
bloody
mysteries
of
the
formidable
test
of
war
here
man
appears
as
his
naked
self
he
is
a
poor
thing
when
he
succumbs
to
unworthy
deeds
and
panics
he
is
great
under
the
impulse
of
voluntary
sacrifice
which
transforms
him
under
fire
and
for
honor
or
the
salvation
of
others
makes
him
face
death
the
sound
and
complete
discussions
of
ardant
du
picq
take
up
in
a
poignant
way
the
setting
of
every
military
drama
they
envelop
in
a
circle
of
invariable
phenomena
the
apparent
irregularity
of
combat
determining
the
critical
point
in
the
outcome
of
the
battle
whatever
be
the
conditions
time
or
people
he
gives
a
code
of
rules
which
will
not
perish
with
the
enthusiasm
of
pascal
who
should
have
been
a
soldier
ardant
du
picq
has
the
preëminent
gift
of
expressing
the
infinite
in
magic
words
he
unceasingly
opens
an
abyss
under
the
feet
of
the
reader
the
whole
metaphysics
of
war
is
contained
therein
and
is
grasped
at
a
single
glance
he
shows
weighed
in
the
scales
of
an
amazing
exactitude
the
normal
efficiency
of
an
army
a
multitude
of
beings
shaken
by
the
most
contradictory
passions
first
desiring
to
save
their
own
skins
and
yet
resigned
to
any
risk
for
the
sake
of
a
principle
he
shows
the
quantity
and
quality
of
possible
efforts
the
aggregate
of
losses
the
effects
of
training
and
impulse
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
troops
engaged
this
value
is
the
sum
of
all
that
the
leader
can
extract
from
any
and
every
combination
of
physical
preparation
confidence
fear
of
punishment
emulation
enthusiasm
inclination
the
promise
of
success
administration
of
camps
fire
discipline
the
influence
of
ability
and
superiority
etc
he
shows
the
tragic
depths
so
somber
below
so
luminous
above
which
appear
in
the
heart
of
the
combatant
torn
between
fear
and
duty
in
the
private
soldier
the
sense
of
duty
may
spring
from
blind
obedience
in
the
officer
responsible
for
his
detachment
from
devotion
to
his
trade
in
the
commanding
officer
from
supreme
responsibility
it
is
in
battle
that
a
military
organization
justifies
its
existence
money
spent
by
the
billions
men
trained
by
the
millions
are
gambled
on
one
irrevocable
moment
organization
decides
the
terrible
contest
which
means
the
triumph
or
the
downfall
of
the
nation
the
harsh
rays
of
glory
beam
above
the
field
of
carnage
destroying
the
vanquished
without
scorching
the
victor
such
are
the
basic
elements
of
strategy
and
tactics
there
is
danger
in
theoretical
speculation
of
battle
in
prejudice
in
false
reasoning
in
pride
in
braggadocio
there
is
one
safe
resource
the
return
to
nature
the
strategy
that
moves
in
elevated
spheres
is
in
danger
of
being
lost
in
the
clouds
it
becomes
ridiculous
as
soon
as
it
ceases
to
conform
to
actual
working
tactics
in
his
classical
work
on
the
decisive
battle
of
august
captain
fritz
hoenig
has
reached
a
sound
conclusion
after
his
biting
criticism
of
the
many
gross
errors
of
steinmetz
and
zastrow
after
his
description
of
the
triple
panic
of
the
german
troops
opposite
the
french
left
in
the
valley
and
the
ravine
of
the
mance
he
ends
by
a
reflection
which
serves
as
a
striking
ending
to
the
book
he
says
the
grandest
illustration
of
moltke
strategy
was
the
battle
of
privat
but
the
battle
of
gravelotte
has
taught
us
one
thing
and
that
is
the
best
strategy
can
not
produce
good
results
if
tactics
is
at
fault
the
right
kind
of
tactics
is
not
improvised
it
asserts
itself
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
but
it
is
learned
before
meeting
the
enemy
there
are
men
says
ardant
du
picq
such
as
marshal
bugeaud
who
are
born
military
in
character
mind
intelligence
and
temperament
not
all
leaders
are
of
this
stamp
there
is
then
need
for
standard
or
regulation
tactics
appropriate
to
the
national
character
which
should
be
the
guide
for
the
ordinary
commander
and
which
do
not
exact
of
him
the
exceptional
qualities
of
a
bugeaud
tactics
is
an
art
based
on
the
knowledge
of
how
to
make
men
fight
with
their
maximum
energy
against
fear
a
maximum
which
organization
alone
can
give
and
here
confidence
appears
it
is
not
the
enthusiastic
and
thoughtless
confidence
of
tumultuous
or
improvised
armies
that
gives
way
on
the
approach
of
danger
to
a
contrary
sentiment
which
sees
treason
everywhere
but
the
intimate
firm
conscious
confidence
which
alone
makes
true
soldiers
and
does
not
disappear
at
the
moment
of
action
we
now
have
an
army
it
is
not
difficult
for
us
to
see
that
people
animated
by
passions
even
people
who
know
how
to
die
without
flinching
strong
in
the
face
of
death
but
without
discipline
and
solid
organization
are
conquered
by
others
who
are
individually
less
valiant
but
firmly
organized
all
together
and
one
for
all
solidarity
and
confidence
can
not
be
improvised
they
can
be
born
only
of
mutual
acquaintanceship
which
establishes
pride
and
makes
unity
and
from
unity
comes
in
turn
the
feeling
of
force
that
force
which
gives
to
the
attack
the
courage
and
confidence
of
victory
courage
that
is
to
say
the
domination
of
the
will
over
instinct
even
in
the
greatest
danger
leads
finally
to
victory
or
defeat
in
asking
for
a
doctrine
in
combat
and
in
seeking
to
base
it
on
the
moral
element
ardant
du
picq
was
ahead
of
his
generation
he
has
had
a
very
great
influence
but
the
doctrine
is
not
yet
established
how
to
approach
the
adversary
how
to
pass
from
the
defensive
to
the
offensive
how
to
regulate
the
shock
how
to
give
orders
that
can
be
executed
how
to
transmit
them
surely
how
to
execute
them
by
economizing
precious
lives
such
are
the
distressing
problems
that
beset
generals
and
others
in
authority
the
result
is
that
presidents
kings
and
emperors
hesitate
tremble
interrogate
pile
reports
upon
reports
maneuvers
upon
maneuvers
retard
the
improvement
of
their
military
material
their
organization
their
equipment
the
only
leaders
who
are
equal
to
the
difficulties
of
future
war
come
to
conclusions
expressed
in
almost
the
same
terms
recently
general
de
negrier
after
having
insisted
that
physical
exhaustion
determined
by
the
nervous
tension
of
the
soldier
increased
in
surprising
proportions
according
to
the
invisibility
of
the
adversary
expressed
himself
as
follows
the
tide
of
battle
is
in
the
hands
of
each
fighter
and
never
at
any
time
has
the
individual
bravery
of
the
soldier
had
more
importance
whatever
the
science
of
the
superior
commander
the
genius
of
his
strategic
combinations
the
precision
of
his
concentrations
whatever
numerical
superiority
he
may
have
victory
will
escape
him
if
the
soldier
does
not
conduct
himself
without
being
watched
and
if
he
is
not
personally
animated
by
the
resolution
to
conquer
or
to
perish
he
needs
much
greater
energy
that
formerly
he
no
longer
has
the
intoxication
of
ancient
attacks
in
mass
to
sustain
him
formerly
the
terrible
anxiety
of
waiting
made
him
wish
for
the
violent
blow
dangerous
but
soon
passed
now
all
his
normal
and
physical
powers
are
tried
for
long
hours
and
in
such
a
test
he
will
have
but
the
resoluteness
of
his
own
heart
to
sustain
him
armies
of
gain
decisions
by
action
in
open
order
where
each
soldier
must
act
individually
with
will
and
initiative
to
attack
the
enemy
and
destroy
him
the
frenchman
has
always
been
an
excellent
rifleman
intelligent
adroit
and
bold
he
is
naturally
brave
the
metal
is
good
the
problem
is
to
temper
it
it
must
be
recognized
that
this
task
is
not
easy
the
desire
for
physical
comfort
the
international
theories
which
come
therefrom
preferring
economic
slavery
and
work
for
the
profit
of
the
stranger
to
the
struggle
do
not
incite
the
frenchman
to
give
his
life
in
order
to
save
that
of
his
brother
the
new
arms
are
almost
valueless
in
the
hands
of
weakhearted
soldiers
no
matter
what
their
number
may
be
on
the
contrary
the
demoralizing
power
of
rapid
and
smokeless
firing
which
certain
armies
still
persist
in
not
acknowledging
manifests
itself
with
so
much
the
more
force
as
each
soldier
possesses
greater
valor
and
cool
energy
it
is
then
essential
to
work
for
the
development
of
the
moral
forces
of
the
nation
they
alone
will
sustain
the
soldier
in
the
distressing
test
of
battle
where
death
comes
unseen
that
is
the
most
important
of
the
lessons
of
the
south
african
war
small
nations
will
find
therein
the
proof
that
in
preparing
their
youth
for
their
duties
as
soldiers
and
creating
in
the
hearts
of
all
the
wish
for
sacrifice
they
are
certain
to
live
free
but
only
at
this
price
this
profession
of
faith
contradicts
the
imbecile
sophisms
foolishly
put
into
circulation
by
high
authority
and
a
thoughtless
press
on
the
efficiency
of
the
mass
which
is
nothing
but
numbers
on
the
fantastic
value
of
new
arms
which
are
declared
sufficient
for
gaining
a
victory
by
simple
mechanical
perfection
on
the
suppression
of
individual
courage
it
is
almost
as
though
courage
had
become
a
superfluous
and
embarrassing
factor
nothing
is
more
likely
to
poison
the
army
ardant
du
picq
is
the
best
specific
against
the
heresies
and
the
follies
of
ignorance
or
of
pedantry
here
are
some
phrases
of
unerring
truth
they
ought
to
be
impressed
upon
all
memories
inscribed
upon
the
walls
of
our
military
schools
they
ought
to
be
learned
as
lessons
by
our
officers
and
they
ought
to
rule
them
as
regulations
and
pass
into
their
blood
man
is
capable
of
but
a
given
quantity
of
fear
one
must
swallow
in
five
minutes
the
dose
that
one
took
in
an
hour
in
day
there
is
greater
need
than
ever
for
rigid
formation
who
can
say
that
he
never
felt
fear
in
battle
and
with
modern
appliances
with
their
terrible
effect
on
the
nervous
system
discipline
is
all
the
more
necessary
because
one
fights
only
in
open
formation
combat
exacts
a
moral
cohesion
a
solidarity
more
compact
that
ever
before
since
the
invention
of
fire
arms
the
musket
rifle
cannon
the
distances
of
mutual
aid
and
support
are
increased
between
the
various
arms
the
more
men
think
themselves
isolated
the
more
need
they
have
of
high
morale
we
are
brought
by
dispersion
to
the
need
of
a
cohesion
greater
than
ever
before
it
is
a
truth
so
clear
as
to
be
almost
naïve
that
if
one
does
not
wish
bonds
broken
he
should
make
them
elastic
and
thereby
strengthen
them
it
is
not
wise
to
lead
eighty
thousand
men
upon
the
battle
field
of
whom
but
fifty
thousand
will
fight
it
would
be
better
to
have
fifty
thousand
all
of
whom
would
fight
these
fifty
thousand
would
have
their
hearts
in
the
work
more
than
the
others
who
should
have
confidence
in
their
comrades
but
can
not
when
of
them
shirk
their
work
the
rôle
of
the
skirmisher
becomes
more
and
more
predominant
it
is
more
necessary
to
watch
over
and
direct
him
as
he
is
used
against
deadlier
weapons
and
as
he
is
consequently
more
prone
to
try
to
escape
from
them
at
all
costs
in
any
direction
the
thing
is
then
to
find
a
method
that
partially
regulates
the
action
of
our
soldiers
who
advance
by
fleeing
or
escape
by
advancing
as
you
like
and
if
something
unexpected
surprises
them
escape
as
quickly
by
falling
back
esprit
de
corps
improves
with
experience
in
wars
war
becomes
shorter
and
shorter
and
more
and
more
violent
therefore
create
in
advance
an
esprit
de
corps
these
truths
are
eternal
this
whole
volume
is
but
their
masterful
development
they
prove
that
together
with
audacious
sincerity
in
the
coördination
of
facts
and
an
infallible
judgment
ardant
du
picq
possessed
prescience
in
the
highest
degree
his
prophetic
eye
distinguished
sixty
years
ago
the
constituent
principles
of
a
good
army
these
are
the
principles
which
lead
to
victory
they
are
radically
opposed
to
those
which
enchant
our
parliamentarians
or
military
politicians
which
are
based
on
a
fatal
favoritism
and
which
precipitate
wars
ardant
du
picq
is
not
alone
a
superior
doctrinaire
he
will
be
consulted
with
profit
in
practical
warlike
organization
no
one
has
better
depicted
the
character
of
modern
armies
no
one
knew
better
the
value
of
what
clausewitz
called
the
product
of
armed
force
and
the
country
force
the
heart
and
soul
of
a
nation
no
more
let
us
forget
that
he
launched
before
the
famous
prediction
of
von
der
goltz
this
optimistic
view
well
calculated
to
rekindle
the
zeal
of
generals
who
struggle
under
the
weight
of
enormous
tasks
incident
to
obligatory
service
extremes
meet
in
many
things
in
the
ancient
times
of
conflict
with
pike
and
sword
armies
were
seen
to
conquer
other
solid
armies
even
though
one
against
two
who
knows
if
the
perfection
of
arms
might
not
bring
back
these
heroic
victories
who
knows
whether
a
smaller
number
by
some
combination
of
good
sense
or
genius
or
morale
and
of
appliances
will
not
overcome
a
greater
number
equally
well
armed
after
the
abandonment
of
the
law
of
and
the
repeal
of
the
law
of
and
before
the
introduction
of
numerous
and
disquieting
reforms
in
recruitment
and
consequently
in
the
education
of
our
regiments
would
it
not
be
opportune
to
study
ardant
du
picq
and
look
for
the
secret
of
force
in
his
ideas
rather
than
in
the
deceptive
illusions
of
military
automatism
and
materialism
the
martial
mission
of
france
is
no
more
ended
than
war
itself
the
severities
of
war
may
be
deplored
but
the
precarious
justice
of
arbitration
tribunals
still
weak
and
divested
of
sanction
has
not
done
away
with
its
intervention
in
earthly
quarrels
i
do
not
suppose
that
my
country
is
willing
to
submit
to
the
mean
estate
scourged
with
superb
contempt
by
donoso
cortes
who
says
when
a
nation
shows
a
civilized
horror
of
war
it
receives
directly
the
punishment
of
its
mistake
god
changes
its
sex
despoils
it
of
its
common
mark
of
virility
changes
it
into
a
feminine
nation
and
sends
conquerors
to
ravish
it
of
its
honor
france
submits
sometimes
to
the
yoke
of
subtle
dialecticians
who
preach
total
disarmament
who
spread
insanely
disastrous
doctrine
of
capitulation
glorify
disgrace
and
humiliation
and
stupidly
drive
us
on
to
suicide
the
manly
counsels
of
ardant
du
picq
are
admirable
lessons
for
a
nation
awakening
since
she
must
sooner
or
later
take
up
her
idle
sword
again
may
france
learn
from
him
to
fight
well
for
herself
and
for
humanity
ernest
judet
paris
october
ardant
du
picq
has
said
little
about
himself
in
his
writings
he
veils
with
care
his
personality
his
life
and
career
little
known
are
the
more
worthy
of
the
reader
interest
because
the
man
is
as
original
as
the
writer
to
satisfy
a
natural
curiosity
i
asked
the
family
for
the
details
of
his
life
enshrined
in
their
memory
his
brother
has
kindly
furnished
them
in
a
letter
to
me
it
contains
many
unpublished
details
and
shows
traits
of
character
which
confirm
our
estimate
of
the
man
ardant
du
picq
it
completes
very
happily
the
impression
made
by
his
book
paris
october
herewith
are
some
random
biographical
notes
on
the
author
of
sur
le
combat
which
you
requested
of
me
my
brother
entered
quite
late
at
years
which
was
i
believe
the
age
limit
at
that
time
this
was
not
his
initial
preference
he
had
a
marked
preference
for
a
naval
career
in
which
adventure
seemed
to
offer
an
opportunity
for
his
activity
and
which
he
would
have
entered
if
the
circumstances
had
so
permitted
his
childhood
was
turbulent
and
somewhat
intractable
but
attaining
adolescence
he
retained
from
his
former
violence
a
very
pronounced
taste
for
physical
exercise
especially
for
gymnastics
little
practiced
then
to
which
he
was
naturally
inclined
by
his
agility
and
muscular
strength
he
was
successful
in
his
classes
very
much
so
in
studies
which
were
to
his
taste
principally
french
composition
in
this
he
rose
above
the
usual
level
of
schoolboy
exercises
when
the
subject
interested
him
certain
other
branches
that
were
uninteresting
or
distasteful
to
him
as
for
instance
latin
grammar
he
neglected
i
do
not
remember
ever
having
seen
him
attend
a
distribution
of
prizes
although
he
was
highly
interested
perhaps
because
he
was
too
interested
on
these
occasions
he
would
disappear
generally
after
breakfast
and
not
be
seen
until
evening
his
bent
was
toward
mechanical
notions
and
handiwork
he
was
not
uninterested
in
mathematics
but
his
interest
in
this
was
ordinary
he
was
nearly
refused
entrance
to
he
became
confused
before
the
examiners
and
the
results
of
the
first
part
of
the
tests
were
almost
negligible
he
consoled
himself
with
his
favorite
maxim
as
a
young
man
philosophy
considering
the
first
test
as
over
and
done
with
he
faced
the
second
test
with
perfect
indifference
this
attitude
gave
him
another
opportunity
and
he
came
out
with
honors
as
he
had
done
well
with
the
written
test
on
campaigns
he
was
given
a
passing
grade
at
school
he
was
liked
by
all
his
comrades
for
his
good
humor
and
frank
and
sympathetic
character
later
in
the
regiment
he
gained
naturally
and
without
effort
the
affection
of
his
equals
and
the
respect
of
his
subordinates
the
latter
were
grateful
to
him
for
the
real
cordial
and
inspiring
interest
he
showed
in
their
welfare
for
he
was
familiar
with
the
details
of
the
service
and
with
the
equipment
he
would
not
compromise
on
such
matters
and
prevaricators
who
had
to
do
with
him
did
not
emerge
creditably
it
can
be
said
that
after
reaching
manhood
he
never
lied
the
absolute
frankness
from
which
he
never
departed
under
any
circumstances
gave
him
prestige
superior
to
his
rank
a
mere
lieutenant
he
voted
to
the
coup
of
december
and
was
admonished
by
his
colonel
who
was
sorry
to
see
him
compromise
thus
his
future
he
replied
with
his
usual
rectitude
since
my
opinion
was
asked
for
i
must
suppose
that
it
was
wanted
on
the
eve
of
the
crimean
war
his
regiment
not
seeming
destined
to
take
the
field
he
asked
for
and
obtained
a
transfer
to
the
light
infantry
battalion
it
was
with
this
battalion
that
he
served
in
the
campaign
when
it
commenced
he
made
his
first
appearance
in
the
fatal
dobrutscha
expedition
this
was
undertaken
in
a
most
unhealthy
region
on
the
chance
of
finding
there
cossacks
who
would
have
furnished
matter
for
a
communiqué
no
cossacks
were
found
but
the
cholera
was
it
cut
down
in
a
few
hours
so
as
to
speak
a
large
portion
of
the
total
strength
my
brother
left
with
the
rear
guard
to
bury
the
dead
burn
their
effects
and
bring
up
the
sick
was
in
his
turn
infected
the
attack
was
very
violent
and
he
recovered
only
because
he
would
not
give
in
to
the
illness
evacuated
to
the
varna
hospital
he
was
driven
out
the
first
night
by
the
burning
of
the
town
and
was
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
the
surrounding
fields
where
the
healthfulness
of
the
air
gave
him
unexpected
relief
returned
to
france
as
a
convalescent
he
remained
there
until
the
month
of
december
he
then
rejoined
his
regiment
and
withstood
to
the
end
the
rigors
of
the
winter
and
the
slowness
of
the
siege
salle
division
to
which
the
trochu
brigade
belonged
and
in
which
my
brother
served
was
charged
with
the
attack
on
the
central
bastion
this
operation
was
considered
a
simple
diversion
without
a
chance
of
success
my
brother
commanding
the
storming
column
of
his
battalion
had
the
good
fortune
to
come
out
safe
and
sound
from
the
deadly
fire
to
which
he
was
exposed
and
which
deprived
the
battalion
of
several
good
officers
he
entered
the
bastion
with
a
dozen
men
all
were
naturally
made
prisoners
after
a
resistance
which
would
have
cost
my
brother
his
life
if
the
bugler
at
his
side
had
not
warded
off
a
saber
blow
at
his
head
upon
his
return
from
captivity
in
the
first
months
of
he
was
immediately
made
major
in
the
regiment
of
the
line
at
the
instance
of
general
trochu
who
regarded
him
highly
he
was
called
the
following
year
to
the
command
of
the
battalion
of
foot
chasseurs
he
served
with
this
battalion
during
the
syrian
campaign
where
there
was
but
little
serious
action
back
again
in
france
his
promotion
to
the
grade
of
notwithstanding
his
excellent
ratings
and
his
place
on
the
promotion
list
was
long
retarded
by
the
of
marshal
randon
the
minister
of
war
marshal
randon
complained
of
his
independent
character
and
bore
him
malice
from
an
incident
relative
to
the
furnishing
of
shoes
intended
for
his
battalion
my
brother
questioned
by
marshal
niel
about
the
quality
of
the
lot
of
shoes
had
frankly
declared
it
bad
promoted
finally
to
in
the
in
algeria
he
took
the
field
there
in
two
campaigns
i
believe
appointed
colonel
of
the
of
the
line
in
february
he
was
stationed
at
lorient
and
at
limoges
during
the
eighteen
months
before
the
war
with
germany
he
busied
himself
during
this
period
with
the
preparation
of
his
work
soliciting
from
all
sides
information
it
was
slow
in
coming
in
due
certainly
to
indifference
rather
than
he
made
several
trips
to
paris
for
the
purpose
of
opening
the
eyes
of
those
in
authority
to
the
defective
state
of
the
army
and
the
perils
of
the
situation
vain
attempts
take
all
that
philosophically

used
to
say
please
accept
sir
with
renewed
acknowledgements
of
gratitude
the
expression
of
my
most
distinguished
sentiments
ardant
du
picq
as
to
the
question
of
atavism
in
which
you
showed
some
interest
in
our
first
conversation
i
may
say
that
our
paternal
line
does
not
in
my
knowledge
include
any
military
man
the
oldest
ancestor
i
know
of
according
to
an
album
of
engravings
by
albert
dürer
recovered
in
a
garret
was
a
gold
and
silversmith
at
limoges
towards
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
his
descendants
have
always
been
traders
down
to
my
grandfather
who
from
what
i
have
heard
said
did
not
in
the
least
attend
to
his
trade
the
case
is
different
with
my
mother
family
which
came
from
lorraine
our
was
a
soldier
our
grandfather
also
and
two
at
least
of
my

their
lives

counted
hundred

ten
present
not
including
the
band
the
sappers
and
the

section
which
raised
the

the
troops
of
the

were
soon
organized
and
marshal
canrobert
reviewed
them
on
the
of
july
on
august
the
division
received
orders
to
move
to
nancy
it
was
placed
on
nine
trains
of
which
the
first
left
at
arriving
in
the
evening
at
its
destination
the
brigade
camped
on
the
leopold
racetrack
and
the
regiment
established
itself
on
the
place
de
la
grève
the
defeats
of
forbach
and
reichshofen
soon
caused
these
first
plans
to
be
modified
the

was
ordered

the
corps
however
was
to
remain
but
a
few
days
in
camp
on
the
it
received
orders
to
go
to
metz
on
the
morning
of
the
the
regiment
was
again
placed
on
three
successive
trains
the
first
train
carrying
the
staff
and
the
battalion
arrived
at
metz
without
incident
the
second
train
transporting
the
battalion
and
four
companies
of
the
was
stopped
at
about
near
the
frouard
branch
the
telegraph
line
was
cut
by
a
prussian
party
near
dieulouard
for
a
length
of
two
kilometers
and
it
was
feared
the
road
was
damaged
in
order
not
to
delay
his
arrival
at
metz
nor
the
progress
of
the
trains
following
major
morin
at
the
head
of
the
column
directed
his
commands
to
detrain
and
continue

caused
the
company
at
the
head
of
the
train
to
alight
company
battalion
commanded
by
captain
valpajola
and
sent
it
reconnoitering
on
the
road
about
three
hundred
meters
in
advance
of
the
train
all
precautions
were
taken
to
assure
the
security
of
the
train
which
regulated
its
progress
on
that
of
the
scouts
after
a
run
of
about
eight
kilometers
in
this
way
at
marbache
station
all
danger
having
disappeared
and
communication
with
metz
having
been
established
the
train
resumed
its
regulation
speed
in
consequence
of
the
slowing
up
of
the
second
column
the
third
followed
at
a
short
distance
until
it
also
arrived
on
the
afternoon
of
the
the
regiment
was
entirely
united
the
division
of
which
it
was
a
part
was
sent
beyond
montigny
and
it
camped
there
as
follows
the
chasseurs
and
regiment
of
the
line
ahead
of
the
thionville
railroad
the
right
on
the
moselle
the

the
regiment
of
the

thionville
and
nancy
lines
the
left
in
the
direction
of
in
front
of
the
montigny
repair
shops
of
the
eastern
railroad
lines
the
regiment
was
thus
placed
in
the
rear
of
a
redoubt
under
construction
the
company
of
engineers
was
placed
at
the
left
of
the
near
the
on
which
it
was
to
work
along
the
ridge
of
the
plateau
toward
the
seille
was
the
brigade
which
rested
its
left
on
the
river
and
its
right
perpendicular
to
the
road
in
rear
of
the
of
this
name
the
divisional
batteries
were
behind
it
the
division
kept
this
position
august
and
during
the
morning
of
the
in
the
afternoon
an
alarm
made
the
division
take
arms
during
the
engagement
that
took
place
on
the
side
of
vallières
and
battle
of
borny
the
regiment
immediately
occupied
positions
on
the
left
of
the
village
of
montigny
at
nightfall
the
division
retired
to
the
rear
of
the
railroad
cut
and
received
orders
to
hold
itself
in
readiness
to
leave
during
the
night
the
regiment
remained
thus
under
arms
the
battalion
major
deschesnes
passing
the
night
on
grand
guard
in
front
of
the
montigny
redoubt
before
daybreak
the
division
marched
over
the
bank
of
the
thionville
railroad
crossed
the
moselle
and
marching
towards
gravelotte
descended
into
the
plain
south
of
where
the
principal
halt
was
made
and
coffee
prepared
scarcely
had
stacks
been
made
and
the
men
set
to
making
fires
about
when
shells
exploded
in
the
midst
of
the
troops
the
shots
came
from
the
bradin
farm
situated
on
the
heights
of
montigny
which
the
division
had
just
left
the
same
morning
and
which
a
german
cavalry
reconnaissance
patrol
supported
by
two
pieces
had
suddenly
occupied
the
colonel
had
arms
taken
at
once
and
disposed
the
regiment
north
of
the
road
which
being
elevated
provided
sufficient
cover
for
defilading
the
men
he
himself
stood
in
the
road
to
put
heart
into
his
troops
by
his
attitude
they
having
been
a
little
startled
by
this
surprise
and
the
baptism
of
fire
which
they
received
under
such
disadvantageous
circumstances
suddenly
a
shell
burst
over
the
road
a
few
feet
from
the
colonel
and
mutilated
his
legs
in
a
frightful
manner
the
same
shell
caused
other
ravages
in
the
ranks
of
the
the
commander
of
the
battalion
major
deschesnes
was
mortally
wounded
captain
reboulet
was
killed
lieutenant
pone
battalion
company
and
eight
men
of
the
regiment
were
wounded
the
colonel
was
immediately
taken
to
the
other
side
of
the
highway
into
the
midst
of
his
soldiers
and
a
surgeon
called
those
of
the
regiment
being
already
engaged
in
caring
for
the
other
victims
of
the
terrible
shot
in
the
meantime
colonel
ardant
du
picq
asked
for
doleac
delivered
to
him
his
saddlebags
containing
important
papers
concerning
the
regiment
and
gave
him
his
field
glasses
then
without
uttering
the
least
sound
of
pain
notwithstanding
the
frightful
injury
from
which
he
must
have
suffered
horribly
he
said
with
calmness
my
regret
is
to
be
struck
in
this
way
without
having
been
able
to
lead
my
regiment
on
the
enemy
they
wanted
him
to
take
a
little
brandy
he
refused
and
accepted
some
water
which
a
soldier
offered
him
a
surgeon
arrived
finally
the
colonel
showing
him
his
right
leg
open
in
two
places
made
with
his
hand
the
sign
of
amputating
at
the
thigh
saying
doctor
it
is
necessary
to
amputate
my
leg
here
at
this
moment
a
soldier
wounded
in
the
shoulder
and
placed
near
the
colonel
groaned
aloud
forgetting
his
own
condition
the
colonel
said
immediately
to
the
surgeon
see
first
doctor
what
is
the
matter
with
this
brave
man
i
can
wait
because
of
the
lack
of
instruments
it
was
not
possible
to
perform
the
amputation
on
the
ground
as
the
colonel
desired
so
this
much
deplored
commander
was
transported
to
the
metz
hospital
four
days
later
of
august
colonel
ardant
du
picq
died
like
a
hero
of
old
without
uttering
the
least
complaint
far
from
his
regiment
far
from
his
family
he
uttered
several
times
the
words
which
summed
up
his
affections
my
wife
my
children
my
regiment
adieu
part
one
ancient
battle
introduction
battle
is
the
final
objective
of
armies
and
man
is
the
fundamental
instrument
in
battle
nothing
can
wisely
be
prescribed
in
an
army
its
personnel
organization
discipline
and
tactics
things
which
are
connected
like
the
fingers
of
a
hand
without
exact
knowledge
of
the
fundamental
instrument
man
and
his
state
of
mind
his
morale
at
the
instant
of
combat
it
often
happens
that
those
who
discuss
war
taking
the
weapon
for
the
starting
point
assume
unhesitatingly
that
the
man
called
to
serve
it
will
always
use
it
as
contemplated
and
ordered
by
the
regulations
but
such
a
being
throwing
off
his
variable
nature
to
become
an
impassive
pawn
an
abstract
unit
in
the
combinations
of
battle
is
a
creature
born
of
the
musings
of
the
library
and
not
a
real
man
man
is
flesh
and
blood
he
is
body
and
soul
and
strong
as
the
soul
often
is
it
can
not
dominate
the
body
to
the
point
where
there
will
not
be
a
revolt
of
the
flesh
and
mental
perturbation
in
the
face
of
destruction
the
human
heart
to
quote
marshal
de
saxe
is
then
the
starting
point
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
war
let
us
study
the
heart
not
in
modern
battle
complicated
and
not
readily
grasped
but
in
ancient
battle
for
although
nowhere
explained
in
detail
ancient
battle
was
simple
and
clear
centuries
have
not
changed
human
nature
passions
instincts
among
them
the
most
powerful
one
of
may
be
manifested
in
various
ways
according
to
the
time
the
place
the
character
and
temperament
of
the
race
thus
in
our
times
we
can
admire
under
the
same
conditions
of
danger
emotion
and
anguish
the
calmness
of
the
english
the
dash
of
the
french
and
that
inertia
of
the
russians
which
is
called
tenacity
but
at
bottom
there
is
always
found
the
same
man
it
is
this
man
that
we
see
disposed
of
by
the
experts
by
the
masters
when
they
organize
and
discipline
when
they
order
detailed
combat
methods
and
take
general
dispositions
for
action
the
best
masters
are
those
who
know
man
best
the
man
of
today
and
the
man
of
history
this
knowledge
naturally
comes
from
a
study
of
formations
and
achievements
in
ancient
war
the
development
of
this
work
leads
us
to
make
such
an
analysis
and
from
a
study
of
combat
we
may
learn
to
know
man
let
us
go
even
back
of
ancient
battle
to
primeval
struggle
in
progressing
from
the
savage
to
our
times
we
shall
get
a
better
grasp
of
life
and
shall
we
then
know
as
much
as
the
masters
no
more
than
one
is
a
painter
by
having
seen
the
methods
of
painting
but
we
shall
better
understand
these
able
men
and
the
great
examples
they
have
left
behind
them
we
shall
learn
from
them
to
distrust
mathematics
and
material
dynamics
as
applied
to
battle
principles
we
shall
learn
to
beware
of
the
illusions
drawn
from
the
range
and
the
maneuver
field
there
experience
is
with
the
calm
settled
unfatigued
attentive
obedient
soldier
with
an
intelligent
and
tractable
in
short
and
not
with
the
nervous
easily
swayed
moved
troubled
distrait
excited
restless
being
not
even
under
who
is
the
fighting
man
from
general
to
private
there
are
strong
men
exceptions
but
they
are
rare
these
illusions
nevertheless
stubborn
and
persistent
always
repair
the
very
next
day
the
most
damaging
injuries
inflicted
on
them
by
experience
their
least
dangerous
effect
is
to
lead
to
prescribing
the
impractical
as
if
ordering
the
impractical
were
not
really
an
attack
on
discipline
and
did
not
result
in
disconcerting
officers
and
men
by
the
unexpected
and
by
surprise
at
the
contrast
between
battle
and
the
theories
of
peacetime
training
battle
of
course
always
furnishes
surprises
but
it
furnishes
less
in
proportion
as
good
sense
and
the
recognition
of
truth
have
had
their
effect
on
the
training
of
the
fighting
man
and
are
disseminated
in
the
ranks
let
us
then
study
man
in
battle
for
it
is
he
who
really
fights
chapter
i
man
in
primitive
and
ancient
combat
man
does
not
enter
battle
to
fight
but
for
victory
he
does
everything
that
he
can
to
avoid
the
first
and
obtain
the
second
war
between
savage
tribes
between
arabs
even
today
is
a
war
of
ambush
by
small
groups
of
men
of
which
each
one
at
the
moment
of
surprise
chooses
not
his
adversary
but
his
victim
and
is
an
assassin
because
the
arms
are
similar
on
both
sides
the
only
way
of
giving
the
advantage
to
one
side
is
by
surprise
a
man
surprised
needs
an
instant
to
collect
his
thoughts
and
defend
himself
during
this
instant
he
is
killed
if
he
does
not
run
away
the
surprised
adversary
does
not
defend
himself
he
tries
to
flee
face
to
face
or
body
to
body
combat
with
primitive
arms
ax
or
dagger
so
terrible
among
enemies
without
defensive
arms
is
very
rare
it
can
take
place
only
between
enemies
mutually
surprised
and
without
a
chance
of
safety
for
any
one
except
in
victory
and
still
in
case
of
mutual
surprise
there
is
another
chance
of
safety
that
of
falling
back
of
flight
on
the
part
of
one
or
the
other
and
that
chance
is
often
seized
here
is
an
example
and
if
it
does
not
concern
savages
at
all
but
soldiers
of
our
days
the
fact
is
none
the
less
significant
it
was
observed
by
a
man
of
warlike
temperament
who
has
related
what
he
saw
with
his
own
eyes
although
he
was
a
forced
spectator
held
to
the
spot
by
a
wound
during
the
crimean
war
on
a
day
of
heavy
fighting
two
detachments
of
soldiers
a
and
b
coming
around
one
of
the
mounds
of
earth
that
covered
the
country
and
meeting
unexpectedly
face
to
face
at
ten
paces
stopped
thunderstruck
then
forgetting
their
rifles
they
threw
stones
and
withdrew
neither
of
the
two
groups
had
a
decided
leader
to
lead
it
to
the
front
and
neither
of
the
two
dared
to
shoot
first
for
fear
that
the
other
would
at
the
same
time
bring
his
own
arm
to
his
shoulder
they
were
too
near
to
hope
to
escape
or
so
they
thought
at
least
although
in
reality
reciprocal
firing
at
such
short
ranges
is
almost
always
too
high
the
man
who
would
fire
sees
himself
already
killed
by
the
return
fire
he
throws
stones
and
not
with
great
force
to
avoid
using
his
rifle
to
distract
the
enemy
to
occupy
the
time
until
flight
offers
him
some
chance
of
escaping
at
range
this
agreeable
state
of
affairs
did
not
last
long
a
minute
perhaps
the
appearance
of
a
troop
b
on
one
flank
determined
the
flight
of
a
and
then
the
opposing
group
fired
surely
the
affair
is
ridiculous
and
laughable
let
us
see
however
in
a
thick
forest
a
lion
and
a
tiger
meet
face
to
face
at
a
turn
in
the
trail
they
stop
at
once
rearing
and
ready
to
spring
they
measure
each
other
with
their
eyes
there
is
a
rumbling
in
their
throats
the
claws
move
convulsively
the
hair
stands
up
with
tails
lashing
the
ground
and
necks
stretched
ears
flattened
lips
turned
up
they
show
their
formidable
fangs
in
that
terrible
threatening
grimace
of
fear
characteristic
of
felines
unseen
i
shudder
the
situation
is
disagreeable
for
both
movement
ahead
means
the
death
of
a
beast
of
which
of
both
perhaps
slowly
quite
slowly
one
leg
bent
for
the
leap
bending
still
moves
a
few
inches
to
the
rear
gently
quite
gently
a
fore
paw
follows
the
movement
after
a
stop
slowly
quite
slowly
the
other
legs
do
the
same
and
both
beasts
insensibly
little
by
little
and
always
facing
withdraw
up
to
the
moment
where
their
mutual
withdrawal
has
created
between
them
an
interval
greater
than
can
be
traversed
in
a
bound
lion
and
tiger
turn
their
backs
slowly
and
without
ceasing
to
observe
walk
freely
they
resume
without
haste
their
natural
gaits
with
that
sovereign
dignity
characteristic
of
great
seigneurs
i
have
ceased
to
shudder
but
i
do
not
laugh
there
is
no
more
to
laugh
at
in
man
in
battle
because
he
has
in
his
hands
a
weapon
more
terrible
than
the
fangs
and
claws
of
lion
or
tiger
the
rifle
which
instantly
without
possible
defense
sends
one
from
life
into
death
it
is
evident
that
no
one
close
to
his
enemy
is
in
a
hurry
to
arm
himself
to
put
into
action
a
force
which
may
kill
him
he
is
not
anxious
to
light
the
fuse
that
is
to
blow
up
the
enemy
and
himself
at
the
same
time
who
has
not
observed
like

cat
and

in
the

of
two
russian
and
two
polish
regiments
of
cavalry
charged
each
other
they
went
with
the
same
dash
to
meet
one
another
when
close
enough
to
recognize
faces
these
cavalrymen
slackened
their
gait
and
both
turned
their
backs
the
russians
and
poles
at
this
terrible
moment
recognized
each
other
as
brothers
and
rather
than
spill
fraternal
blood
they
extricated
themselves
from
a
combat
as
if
it
were
a
crime
that
is
the
version
of
an
eyewitness
and
narrator
a
polish
officer
what
do
you
think
of
cavalry
troops
so
moved
by
brotherly
love
but
let
us
resume
when
people
become
more
numerous
and
when
the
surprise
of
an
entire
population
occupying
a
vast
space
is
no
longer
possible
when
a
sort
of
public
conscience
has
been
cultivated
within
society
one
is
warned
beforehand
war
is
formally
declared
surprise
is
no
longer
the
whole
of
war
but
it
remains
one
of
the
means
in
war
the
best
means
even
man
can
no
longer
kill
his
enemy
without
defense
he
has
forewarned
him
he
must
expect
to
find
him
standing
and
in
numbers
he
must
fight
but
he
wishes
to
conquer
with
as
little
risk
as
possible
he
employs
the
iron
shod
mace
against
the
staff
arrows
against
the
mace
the
shield
against
arrows
the
shield
and
cuirass
against
the
shield
alone
the
long
lance
against
the
short
lance
the
tempered
sword
against
the
iron
sword
the
armed
chariot
against
man
on
foot
and
so
on
man
taxes
his
ingenuity
to
be
able
to
kill
without
running
the
risk
of
being
killed
his
bravery
is
born
of
his
strength
and
it
is
not
absolute
before
a
stronger
he
flees
without
shame
the
instinct
of
is
so
powerful
that
he
does
not
feel
disgraced
in
obeying
it
although
thanks
to
the
defensive
power
of
arms
and
armor
he
can
fight
at
close
quarters
can
you
expect
him
to
act
in
any
other
way
man
must
test
himself
before
acknowledging
a
stronger
but
once
the
stronger
is
recognized
no
one
will
face
him
individual
strength
and
valor
were
supreme
in
primitive
combats
so
much
so
that
when
its
heroes
were
killed
the
nation
was
conquered
as
a
result
of
a
mutual
and
tacit
understanding
combatants
often
stopped
fighting
to
watch
with
awe
and
anxiety
two
champions
struggling
whole
peoples
often
placed
their
fate
in
the
hands
of
the
champions
who
took
up
the
task
and
who
alone
fought
this
was
perfectly
natural
they
counted
their
champion
a
superman
and
no
man
can
stand
against
the
superman
but
intelligence
rebels
against
the
dominance
of
force
no
one
can
stand
against
an
achilles
but
no
achilles
can
withstand
ten
enemies
who
uniting
their
efforts
act
in
concert
this
is
the
reason
for
tactics
which
prescribe
beforehand
proper
means
of
organization
and
action
to
give
unanimity
to
effort
and
for
discipline
which
insures
united
efforts
in
spite
of
the
innate
weakness
of
combatants
in
the
beginning
man
battled
against
man
each
one
for
himself
like
a
beast
that
hunts
to
kill
yet
flees
from
that
which
would
kill
him
but
now
prescriptions
of
discipline
and
tactics
insure
unity
between
leader
and
soldier
between
the
men
themselves
besides
the
intellectual
progress
is
there
a
moral
progress
to
secure
unity
in
combat
to
make
tactical
dispositions
in
order
to
render
it
practically
possible
we
must
be
able
to
count
on
the
devotion
of
all
this
elevates
all
combatants
to
the
level
of
the
champions
of
primitive
combat
esprit
appears
flight
is
a
disgrace
for
one
is
no
longer
alone
in
combat
there
is
a
legion
and
he
who
gives
way
quits
his
commanders
and
his
companions
in
all
respects
the
combatant
is
worth
more
so
reason
shows
us
the
strength
of
wisely
united
effort
discipline
makes
it
possible
will
the
result
be
terrible
fights
conflicts
of
extermination
no
collective
man
a
disciplined
body
of
troops
formed
in
tactical
battle
order
is
invincible
against
an
undisciplined
body
of
troops
but
against
a
similarly
disciplined
body
he
becomes
again
primitive
man
he
flees
before
a
greater
force
of
destruction
when
he
recognizes
it
or
when
he
foresees
it
nothing
is
changed
in
the
heart
of
man
discipline
keeps
enemies
face
to
face
a
little
longer
but
can
not
supplant
the
instinct
of
and
the
sense
of
fear
that
goes
with
it
fear
there
are
officers
and
soldiers
who
do
not
know
it
but
they
are
people
of
rare
grit
the
mass
shudders
because
you
can
not
suppress
the
flesh
this
trembling
must
be
taken
into
account
in
all
organization
discipline
arrangements
movements
maneuvers
mode
of
action
all
these
are
affected
by
the
human
weakness
of
the
soldier
which
causes
him
to
magnify
the
strength
of
the
enemy
this
faltering
is
studied
in
ancient
combat
it
is
seen
that
of
nations
apt
in
war
the
strongest
have
been
those
who
not
only
best
have
understood
the
general
conduct
of
war
but
who
have
taken
human
weakness
into
greatest
account
and
taken
the
best
guarantees
against
it
it
is
notable
that
the
most
warlike
peoples
are
not
always
those
in
which
military
institutions
and
combat
methods
are
the
best
or
the
most
rational
and
indeed
in
warlike
nations
there
is
a
good
dose
of
vanity
they
only
take
into
account
courage
in
their
tactics
one
might
say
that
they
do
not
desire
to
acknowledge
weakness
the
gaul
a
fool
in
war
used
barbarian
tactics
after
the
first
surprise
he
was
always
beaten
by
the
greeks
and
romans
the
greek
a
warrior
but
also
a
politician
had
tactics
far
superior
to
those
of
the
gauls
and
the
asiatics
the
roman
a
politician
above
all
with
whom
war
was
only
a
means
wanted
perfect
means
he
had
no
illusions
he
took
into
account
human
weakness
and
he
discovered
the
legion
but
this
is
merely
affirming
what
should
be
demonstrated

in

books
polybius

into
a
mechanical
discussion
when
he
contrasts
the

and
the

book
the
greeks
were
in
intellectual
civilization
superior
to
the
romans
consequently
their
tactics
ought
to
have
been
far
more
rational
but
such
was
not
the
case
greek
tactics
proceeded
from
mathematical
reasoning
roman
tactics
from
a
profound
knowledge
of
man
heart
naturally
the
greeks
did
not
neglect
morale
nor
the
romans
mechanics
but
their
primary
considerations
were
diverse
what
formation
obtained
the
maximum
effort
from
the
greek
army
what
methods
caused
the
soldiers
of
a
roman
army
to
fight
most
effectively
the
first
question
admits
of
discussion
the
roman
solved
the
second
the
roman
was
not
essentially
brave
he
did
not
produce
any
warrior
of
the
type
of
alexander
it
is
acknowledged
that
the
valorous
impetuosity
of
the
barbarians
gauls
cimbri
teutons
made
him
tremble
but
to
the
glorious
courage
of
the
greeks
to
the
natural
bravery
of
the
gauls
he
opposed
a
strict
sense
of
duty
secured
by
a
terrible
discipline
in
the
masses
it
was
inspired
in
the
officers
by
a
sentiment
of
the
strongest
patriotism
the
discipline
of
the
greeks
was
secured
by
exercises
and
rewards
the
discipline
of
the
romans
was
secured
also
by
the
fear
of
death
they
put
to
death
with
the
club
they
decimated
their
cowardly
or
traitorous
units
in
order
to
conquer
enemies
that
terrified
his
men
a
roman
general
heightened
their
morale
not
by
enthusiasm
but
by
anger
he
made
the
life
of
his
soldiers
miserable
by
excessive
work
and
privations
he
stretched
the
force
of
discipline
to
the
point
where
at
a
critical
instant
it
must
break
or
expend
itself
on
the
enemy
under
similar
circumstances
a
greek
general
caused
tyrtaeus
to
sing
it
would
have
been
curious
to
see
two
such
forces
opposed
but
discipline
alone
does
not
constitute
superior
tactics
man
in
battle
i
repeat
is
a
being
in
whom
the
instinct
of
dominates
at
certain
moments
all
other
sentiments
discipline
has
for
its
aim
the
domination
of
that
instinct
by
a
greater
terror
but
it
can
not
dominate
it
completely
i
do
not
deny
the
glorious
examples
where
discipline
and
devotion
have
elevated
man
above
himself
but
if
these
examples
are
glorious
it
is
because
they
are
rare
if
they
are
admired
it
is
because
they
are
considered
exceptions
and
the
exception
proves
the
rule
the
determination
of
that
instant
where
man
loses
his
reasoning
power
and
becomes
instinctive
is
the
crowning
achievement
in
the
science
of
combat
in
general
here
was
the
strength
of
the
roman
tactics
in
particular
cases
such
successful
determination
makes
hannibals
and
caesars
combat
took
place
between
masses
in
more
or
less
deep
formation
commanded
and
supervised
by
leaders
with
a
definite
mission
the
combat
between
masses
was
a
series
of
individual
conflicts
juxtaposed
with
the
front
rank
man
alone
fighting
if
he
fell
if
he
was
wounded
or
worn
out
he
was
replaced
by
the
man
of
the
second
rank
who
had
watched
and
guarded
his
flanks
this
procedure
continued
up
to
the
last
rank
man
is
always
physically
and
morally
fatigued
in
a
tournament
where
he
employs
all
his
energy
these
contests
generally
lasted
but
a
short
time
with
like
morale
the
least
fatigued
always
won
during
this
engagement
of
the
first
two
ranks
the
one
fighting
the
other
watching
close
at
hand
the
men
of
the
rear
ranks
waited
inactive
at
two
paces
distance
for
their
turn
in
the
combat
which
would
come
only
when
their
predecessors
were
killed
wounded
or
exhausted
they
were
impressed
by
the
violent
fluctuations
of
the
struggle
of
the
first
rank
they
heard
the
clashes
of
the
blows
and
distinguished
perhaps
those
that
sank
into
the
flesh
they
saw
the
wounded
the
exhausted
crawl
through
the
intervals
to
go
to
the
rear
passive
spectators
of
danger
they
were
forced
to
await
its
terrible
approach
these
men
were
subjected
to
the
poignant
emotions
of
combat
without
being
supported
by
the
animation
of
the
struggle
they
were
thus
placed
under
the
moral
pressure
of
the
greatest
of
anxieties
often
they
could
not
stand
it
until
their
turn
came
they
gave
way
the
best
tactics
the
best
dispositions
were
those
that
made
easiest
a
succession
of
efforts
by
assuring
the
relief
by
ranks
of
units
in
action
actually
engaging
only
the
necessary
units
and
keeping
the
rest
as
a
support
or
reserve
outside
of
the
immediate
sphere
of
moral
tension
the
superiority
of
the
romans
lay
in
such
tactics
and
in
the
terrible
discipline
which
prepared
and
assured
the
execution
by
their
resistance
against
fatigue
which
rude
and
continual
tasks
gave
them
and
by
the
renewal
of
combatants
in
combat
they
secured
greater
continuity
of
effort
than
any
others
the
gauls
did
not
reason
seeing
only
the
inflexible
line
they
bound
themselves
together
thus
rendering
relief
impracticable
they
believed
as
did
the
greeks
in
the
power
of
the
mass
and
impulse
of
deep
files
and
did
not
understand
that
deep
files
were
powerless
to
push
the
first
ranks
forward
as
they
recoiled
in
the
face
of
death
it
is
a
strange
error
to
believe
that
the
last
ranks
will
go
to
meet
that
which
made
the
first
ones
fall
back
on
the
contrary
the
contagion
of
recoil
is
so
strong
that
the
stopping
of
the
head
means
the
falling
back
of
the
rear
the
greeks
also
certainly
had
reserves
and
supports
in
the
second
half
of
their
dense
ranks
but
the
idea
of
mass
dominated
they
placed
these
supports
and
reserves
too
near
forgetting
the
essential
man
the
romans
believed
in
the
power
of
mass
but
from
the
moral
point
of
view
only
they
did
not
multiply
the
files
in
order
to
add
to
the
mass
but
to
give
to
the
combatants
the
confidence
of
being
aided
and
relieved
the
number
of
ranks
was
calculated
according
to
the
moral
pressure
that
the
last
ranks
could
sustain
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
man
can
not
bear
the
anxiety
of
combat
in
the
front
lines
without
being
engaged
the
romans
did
not
so
increase
the
number
of
ranks
as
to
bring
about
this
condition
the
greeks
did
not
observe
and
calculate
so
well
they
sometimes
brought
the
number
of
files
up
to
and
their
last
files
which
in
their
minds
were
doubtless
their
reserves
found
themselves
forcibly
dragged
into
the
material
disorder
of
the
first
ones
in
the
order
by
maniples
in
the
roman
legion
the
best
soldiers
those
whose
courage
had
been
proved
by
experience
in
battle
waited
stoically
kept
in
the
second
and
third
lines
they
were
far
enough
away
not
to
suffer
wounds
and
not
to
be
drawn
in
by
the
front
line
retiring
into
their
intervals
yet
they
were
near
enough
to
give
support
when
necessary
or
to
finish
the
job
by
advancing
when
the
three
separate
and
successive
maniples
of
the
first
cohort
were
united
in
order
to
form
the
united
battle
cohort
of
marius
and
of
caesar
the
same
brain
placed
the
most
reliable
men
in
the
last
lines
the
oldest
the
youngest
the
most
impetuous
were
in
the
first
lines
the
legion
was
not
increased
simply
to
make
numbers
or
mass
each
had
his
turn
in
action
each
man
in
his
maniple
each
maniple
in
its
cohort
and
when
the
unit
became
a
cohort
each
cohort
in
the
order
of
battle
we
have
seen
that
the
roman
theory
dictated
a
depth
of
ranks
to
furnish
successive
lines
of
combatants
the
genius
of
the
general
modified
these
established
formations
if
the
men
were
inured
to
war
reliable
tenacious
quick
to
relieve
their
file
leaders
full
of
confidence
in
their
general
and
their
own
comrades
the
general
diminished
the
depth
of
the
files
did
away
with
the
lines
even
in
order
to
increase
the
number
of
immediate
combatants
by
increasing
the
front
his
men
having
a
moral
and
sometimes
also
a
physical
endurance
superior
to
that
of
the
adversary
the
general
knew
that
the
last
ranks
of
the
latter
would
not
under
pressure
hold
sufficiently
to
relieve
the
first
lines
nor
to
forbid
the
relief
of
his
own
hannibal
had
a
part
of
his
infantry
the
africans
armed
and
drilled
in
the
roman
way
his
spanish
infantrymen
had
the
long
wind
of
the
spaniards
of
his
gallic
soldiers
tried
out
by
hardship
were
in
the
same
way
fit
for
long
efforts
hannibal
strong
with
the
confidence
with
which
he
inspired
his
people
drew
up
a
line
less
deep
by
half
than
the
roman
army
and
at
cannae
hemmed
in
an
army
which
had
twice
his
number
and
exterminated
it
caesar
at
pharsalus
for
similar
reasons
did
not
hesitate
to
decrease
his
depth
he
faced
double
his
strength
in
the
army
of
pompey
a
roman
army
like
his
own
and
crushed
it
we
have
mentioned
cannae
and
pharsalus
we
shall
study
in
them
the
mechanism
and
the
morale
of
ancient
combat
two
things
which
can
not
be
separated
we
can
not
find
better
examples
of
battle
more
clearly
and
more
impartially
exhibited
this
is
due
in
one
case
to
the
clear
presentation
of
polybius
who
obtained
his
information
from
the
fugitives
from
cannae
possibly
even
from
some
of
the
conquerors
in
the
other
it
is
due
to
the
impassive
clearness
of

describing

of
polybius
varro
placed
the
cavalry
on
the
right
wing
and
rested
it
on
the
river
the
infantry
was
deployed
near
it
and
on
the
same
line
the
maniples
drawn
close
to
each
other
with
smaller
intervals
than
usual
and
the
maniples
presenting
more
depth
than
front
the
cavalry
of
the
allies
on
the
left
wing
completed
the
line
in
front
of
which
were
posted
the
light
troops
there
were
in
that
army
including
the
allies
eighty
thousand
foot
and
a
little
more
than
six
thousand
horse
meanwhile
hannibal
had
his
slingers
and
light
troops
cross
the
aufidus
and
posted
them
in
front
of
his
army
the
rest
crossed
the
river
at
two
places
he
placed
the
iberian
and
gallic
cavalry
on
the
left
wing
next
the
river
and
facing
the
roman
cavalry
he
placed
on
the
same
line
one
half
of
the
african
infantry
heavily
armed
the
iberian
and
gallic
infantry
the
other
half
of
the
african
infantry
and
finally
the
numidian
cavalry
which
formed
the
right
wing
after
he
had
thus
arrayed
all
his
troops
upon
a
single
line
he
marched
to
meet
the
enemy
with
the
iberian
and
gallic
infantry
moving
independently
of
the
main
body
as
it
was
joined
in
a
straight
line
with
the
rest
on
separating
it
was
formed
like
the
convex
face
of
a
crescent
this
formation
reduced
its
depth
in
the
center
the
intention
of
the
general
was
to
commence
the
battle
with
the
iberians
and
gauls
and
have
them
supported
by
the
africans
the
latter
infantry
was
armed
like
the
roman
infantry
having
been
equipped
by
hannibal
with
arms
that
had
been
taken
from
the
romans
in
preceding
battle
both
iberians
and
gauls
had
shields
but
their
swords
were
quite
different
the
sword
of
the
former
was
as
fit
for
thrusting
as
for
cutting
while
that
of
the
gauls
only
cut
with
the
edge
and
at
a
limited
distance
these
troops
were
drawn
up
as
follows
the
iberians
were
in
two
bodies
of
troops
on
the
wings
near
the
africans
the
gauls
in
the
center
the
gauls
were
nude
the
iberians
in
linen
shirts
of
purple
color
which
to
the
romans
was
an
extraordinary
and
frightening
spectacle
the
carthaginian
army
consisted
of
ten
thousand
horse
and
little
more
than
forty
thousand
foot
aemilius
commanded
the
right
of
the
romans
varro
the
left
the
two
consuls
of
the
past
year
servilius
and
attilius
were
in
the
center
on
the
carthaginian
side
hasdrubal
had
the
left
under
his
orders
hanno
the
right
and
hannibal
who
had
his
brother
mago
with
him
reserved
for
himself
the
command
of
the
center
the
two
armies
did
not
suffer
from
the
glare
of
the
sun
when
it
rose
the
one
being
faced
to
the
south
as
i
remarked
and
the
other
to
the
north
action
commenced
with
the
light
troops
which
were
in
front
of
both
armies
the
first
engagement
gave
advantage
to
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
just
as
soon
as
the
iberian
and
gallic
cavalry
on
the
left
approached
the
conflict
became
hot
the
romans
fought
with
fury
and
rather
more
like
barbarians
than
romans
this
falling
back
and
then
returning
to
the
charge
was
not
according
to
their
tactics
scarcely
did
they
become
engaged
when
they
leaped
from
their
horses
and
each
seized
his
adversary
in
the
meanwhile
the
carthaginians
gained
the
upper
hand
the
greater
number
of
the
romans
remained
on
the
ground
after
having
fought
with
the
greatest
valor
the
others
were
pursued
along
the
river
and
cut
to
pieces
without
being
able
to
obtain
quarter
the
heavily
armed
infantry
immediately
took
the
place
of
the
light
troops
and
became
engaged
the
iberians
and
gauls
held
firm
at
first
and
sustained
the
shock
with
vigor
but
they
soon
gave
way
to
the
weight
of
the
legions
and
opening
the
crescent
turned
their
backs
and
retreated
the
romans
followed
them
with
impetuosity
and
broke
the
gallic
line
much
more
easily
because
the
wings
crowded
toward
the
center
where
the
thick
of
the
fighting
was
the
whole
line
did
not
fight
at
the
same
time
the
action
commenced
in
the
center
because
the
gauls
being
drawn
up
in
the
form
of
a
crescent
left
the
wings
far
behind
them
and
presented
the
convex
face
of
the
crescent
to
the
romans
the
latter
then
followed
the
gauls
and
iberians
closely
and
crowded
towards
the
center
to
the
place
where
the
enemy
gave
way
pushing
ahead
so
forcibly
that
on
both
flanks
they
engaged
the
heavily
armed
africans
the
africans
on
the
right
in
swinging
about
from
right
to
left
found
themselves
all
along
the
enemy
flank
as
well
as
those
on
the
left
which
made
the
swing
from
left
to
right
the
very
circumstances
of
the
action
showed
them
what
they
had
to
do
this
was
what
hannibal
had
foreseen
that
the
romans
pursuing
the
gauls
must
be
enveloped
by
the
africans
the
romans
then
no
longer
able
to
keep
their
formation
were
forced
to
defend
themselves
man
to
man
and
in
small
groups
against
those
who
attacked
them
on
front
and
flank
aemilius
had
escaped
the
carnage
on
the
right
wing
at
the
commencement
of
the
battle
wishing
according
to
the
orders
he
had
given
to
be
everywhere
and
seeing
that
it
was
the
legionary
infantry
that
would
decide
the
fate
of
the
battle
he
pushed
his
horse
through
the
fray
warded
off
or
killed
every
one
who
opposed
him
and
sought
at
the
same
time
to
reanimate
the
ardor
of
the
roman
soldiers
hannibal
who
during
the
entire
battle
remained
in
the
conflict
did
the
same
in
his
army
the
numidian
cavalry
on
the
right
wing
without
doing
or
suffering
much
was
useful
on
that
occasion
by
its
manner
of
fighting
for
pouncing
upon
the
enemy
on
all
sides
they
gave
him
enough
to
do
so
that
he
might
not
have
time
to
think
of
helping
his
own
people
indeed
when
the
left
wing
where
hasdrubal
commanded
had
routed
almost
all
the
cavalry
of
the
roman
right
wing
and
a
junction
had
been
effected
with
the
numidians
the
auxiliary
cavalry
did
not
wait
to
be
attacked
but
gave
way
hasdrubal
is
said
to
have
done
something
which
proved
his
prudence
and
his
ability
and
which
contributed
to
the
success
of
the
battle
as
the
numidians
were
in
great
number
and
as
these
troops
were
never
more
useful
than
when
one
was
in
flight
before
them
he
gave
them
the
fugitives
to
pursue
and
led
the
iberian
and
gallic
cavalry
in
a
charge
to
aid
the
african
infantry
he
pounced
on
the
romans
from
the
rear
and
having
bodies
of
cavalry
charge
into
the
mêlée
at
several
places
he
gave
new
strength
to
the
africans
and
made
the
arms
drop
from
the
hands
of
the
adversaries
it
was
then
that
aemilius
a
citizen
who
during
his
whole
life
as
in
this
last
conflict
had
nobly
fulfilled
his
duties
to
his
country
finally
succumbed
covered
with
mortal
wounds
the
romans
continued
fighting
giving
battle
to
those
who
were
surrounding
them
they
resisted
to
the
last
but
as
their
numbers
diminished
more
and
more
they
were
finally
forced
into
a
smaller
circle
and
all
put
to
the
sword
attilius
and
servilius
two
persons
of
great
probity
who
had
distinguished
themselves
in
the
combat
as
true
romans
were
also
killed
on
that
occasion
while
this
carnage
was
taking
place
in
the
center
the
numidians
pursued
the
fugitives
of
the
left
wing
most
of
them
were
cut
down
others
were
thrown
under
their
horses
some
of
them
escaped
to
venusia
among
these
was
varro
the
roman
general
that
abominable
man
whose
administration
cost
his
country
so
dearly
thus
ended
the
battle
of
cannae
a
battle
where
prodigies
of
valor
were
seen
on
both
sides
of
the
six
thousand
horse
of
which
the
roman
cavalry
was
composed
only
seventy
romans
reached
venusia
with
varro
and
of
the
auxiliary
cavalry
only
three
hundred
men
found
shelter
in
various
towns
ten
thousand
foot
were
taken
prisoners
but
they
were
not
in
the
battle
of
troops
in
battle
only
about
three
thousand
saved
themselves
in
the
nearby
town
the
balance
numbering
about
twenty
thousand
died
on
the
field
of
honor
hannibal
lost
in
that
action
in
the
neighborhood
of
four
thousand
gauls
fifteen
hundred
iberians
and
africans
and
two
hundred
horses
let
us
analyze
the
light
infantry
troops
were
scattered
in
front
of
the
armies
and
skirmished
without
result
the
real
combat
commenced
with
the
attack
on
the
legitimate
cavalry
of
the
roman
left
wing
by
the
cavalry
of
hannibal
there
says
polybius
the
fight
grew
thickest
the
romans
fought
with
fury
and
much
more
like
barbarians
than
like
romans
because
this
falling
back
then
returning
to
the
charge
was
not
according
to
their
tactics
scarcely
did
they
become
engaged
when
they
leaped
from
their
horses
and
each
seized
his
adversary
etc
this
means
that
the
roman
cavalry
did
not
habitually
fight
hand
to
hand
like
the
infantry
it
threw
itself
in
a
gallop
on
the
enemy
cavalry
when
within
javelin
range
if
the
enemy
cavalry
had
not
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
on
seeing
the
roman
cavalry
coming
the
latter
prudently
slackened
its
gait
threw
some
javelins
and
making
an
about
by
platoons
took
to
the
rear
for
the
purpose
of
repeating
the
charge
the
hostile
cavalry
did
the
same
and
such
an
operation
might
be
renewed
several
times
until
one
of
the
two
persuaded
that
his
enemy
was
going
to
attack
him
with
a
dash
turned
in
flight
and
was
pursued
to
the
limit
that
day
the
fight
becoming
hot
they
became
really
engaged
the
two
cavalry
bodies
closed
and
man
fought
man
the
fight
was
forced
however
as
there
was
no
giving
way
on
one
side
or
the
other
it
was
necessary
actually
to
attack
there
was
no
space
for
skirmishing
closed
in
by
the
aufidus
and
the
legions
the
roman
cavalry
could
not
operate
livy
the
iberian
and
gallic
cavalry
likewise
shut
in
and
double
the
roman
cavalry
was
forced
into
two
lines
it
could
still
less
maneuver
this
limited
front
served
the
romans
inferior
in
number
who
could
thus
be
attacked
only
in
front
that
is
by
an
equal
number
it
rendered
as
we
have
said
contact
inevitable
these
two
cavalry
bodies
placed
chest
to
chest
had
to
fight
close
had
to
grapple
man
to
man
and
for
riders
mounted
on
simple
saddle
cloths
and
without
stirrup
embarrassed
with
a
shield
a
lance
a
saber
or
a
sword
to
grapple
man
to
man
is
to
grapple
together
fall
together
and
fight
on
foot
that
is
what
happened
as
the
account
of
titus
livius
explains
it
in
completing
that
of
polybius
the
same
thing
happened
every
time
that
two
ancient
cavalry
organizations
really
had
to
fight
as
the
battle
of
the
tecinus
showed
this
mode
of
action
was
all
to
the
advantage
of
the
romans
who
were
and
therein
note
the
battle
of
tecinus
the
roman
light
infantry
was
cut
to
pieces
but
the
elite
of
the
roman
cavalry
although
surprised
and
surrounded
fought
and
on
horse
back
inflicted
more
casualties
on
the
cavalry
of
hannibal
than
they
suffered
and
brought
back
from
the
field
their
wounded
general
the
romans
besides
were
well
led
by
consul
aemilius
a
man
of
head
and
heart
who
instead
of
fleeing
when
his
cavalry
was
defeated
went
himself
to
die
in
the
ranks
of
the
infantry
meanwhile
we
see
thirty
to
hundred
roman
cavalrymen
nearly
exterminated
by
six
to
seven
thousand
gauls
and
iberians
who
did
not
lose
even
two
hundred
men
hannibal
entire
cavalry
lost
but
two
hundred
men
on
that
day
how
can
that
be
explained
because
most
of
them
died
without
dreaming
of
selling
their
lives
and
because
they
took
to
flight
during
the
fight
of
the
first
line
and
were
struck
with
impunity
from
behind
the
words
of
polybius
most
of
them
remained
on
the
spot
after
having
defended
themselves
with
the
utmost
valor
were
consecrated
words
before
polybius
the
conquered
always
console
themselves
with
their
bravery
and
conquerors
never
contradict
unfortunately
the
figures
are
there
the
facts
of
the
battle
are
found
in
the
account
which
sounds
no
note
of
desperation
the
gallic
and
roman
cavalry
had
each
already
made
a
brave
effort
by
attacking
each
other
from
the
front
this
effort
was
followed
by
the
terrible
anxiety
of
close
combat
the
roman
cavalrymen
who
from
behind
the
combatants
on
foot
were
able
to
see
the
second
gallic
line
on
horse
back
gave
ground
fear
very
quickly
made
the
disengaged
ranks
take
to
their
horses
wheel
about
like
a
flock
of
sheep
in
a
stampede
and
abandon
their
comrades
and
themselves
to
the
mercy
of
the
conquerors
yet
these
horsemen
were
brave
men
the
elite
of
the
army
noble
knights
guards
of
the
consuls
volunteers
of
noble
families
the
roman
cavalry
defeated
hasdrubal
passed
his
gallic
and
iberian
troopers
behind
hannibal
army
to
attack
the
allied
cavalry
till
then
engaged
by
the
numidians
the
cavalry
of
the
allies
did
not
await
the
enemy
it
turned
its
back
immediately
pursued
to
the
utmost
by
the
numidians
who
were
numerous
three
thousand
and
excellent
in
pursuit
it
was
reduced
to
some
three
hundred
men
without
a
struggle
after
the
skirmishing
of
the
light
infantry
troops
the
of
the
line
met
polybius
has
explained
to
us
how
the
roman
infantry
let
itself
be
enclosed
by
the
two
wings
of
the
carthaginian
army
and
taken
in
rear
by
hasdrubal
cavalry
it
is
also
probable
that
the
gauls
and
iberians
repulsed
in
the
first
part
of
the
action
and
forced
to
turn
their
backs
returned
aided
by
a
portion
of
the
light
infantry
to
the
charge
upon
the
apex
of
the
wedge
formed
by
the
romans
and
completed
their
encirclement
but
we
know
as
will
be
seen
further
on
in
examples
taken
from
caesar
that
the
ancient
cavalryman
was
powerless
against
formed
infantry
even
against
the
isolated
infantryman
possessing
coolness
the
iberian
and
gallic
cavalry
ought
to
have
found
behind
the
roman
army
the
reliable
triarians
penned
in
armed
with
pikes
it
might
have
held
them
in
check
forced
them
to
give
battle
but
done
them
little
or
no
harm
as
long
as
the
ranks
were
preserved
we
know
that
of
hannibal
infantry
only
twelve
thousand
at
the
most
were
equipped
with
roman
weapons
we
know
that
his
gallic
and
iberian
infantry
protected
by
plain
shields
had
to
fall
back
turn
and
probably
lost
in
this
part
of
the
action
very
nearly
the
four
thousand
men
which
the
battle
cost
them
let
us
deduct
the
ten
thousand
men
that
had
gone
to
the
attack
of
hannibal
camp
and
the
five
thousand
which
the
latter
must
have
left
there
there
remain
a
mass
of
seventy
thousand
men
surrounded
and
slaughtered
by
thousand
foot
soldiers
or
counting
hasdrubal
cavalry
by
thousand
men
by
half
their
number
it
may
be
asked
how
seventy
thousand
men
could
have
let
themselves
be
slaughtered
without
defense
by
thousand
men
less
when
each
combatant
had
but
one
man
before
him
for
in
close
combat
and
especially
in
so
large
an
envelopment
the
number
of
combatants
immediately
engaged
was
the
same
on
each
side
then
there
were
neither
guns
nor
rifles
able
to
pierce
the
mass
by
a
converging
fire
and
destroy
it
by
the
superiority
of
this
fire
over
diverging
fire
arrows
were
exhausted
in
the
first
period
of
the
action
it
seems
that
by
their
mass
the
romans
must
have
presented
an
insurmountable
resistance
and
that
while
permitting
the
enemy
to
wear
himself
out
against
it
that
mass
had
only
to
defend
itself
in
order
to
repel
assailants
but
it
was
wiped
out
in
pursuit
of
the
gauls
and
iberians
who
certainly
were
not
able
even
with
like
morale
to
stand
against
the
superior
arms
of
the
legionaries
the
center
drove
all
vigorously
before
it
the
wings
in
order
to
support
it
and
not
to
lose
the
intervals
followed
its
movement
by
a
forward
oblique
march
and
formed
the
sides
of
the
salient
the
entire
roman
army
in
wedge
order
marched
to
victory
suddenly
the
wings
were
attacked
by
the
african
battalions
the
gauls
the
iberians
who
had
been
in
retreat
returned
to
the
fight
the
horsemen
of
hasdrubal
in
the
rear
attacked
the
reserves
everywhere
there
was
combat
unexpected
unforeseen
at
the
moment
when
they
believed
themselves
conquerors
everywhere
in
front
to
the
right
to
the
left
in
the
rear
the
roman
soldiers
heard
the
furious
clamor
of
combat
the
physical
pressure
was
unimportant
the
ranks
that
they
were
fighting
had
not
half
their
own
depth
the
moral
pressure
was
enormous
uneasiness
then
terror
took
hold
of
them
the
first
ranks
fatigued
or
wounded
wanted
to
retreat
but
the
last
ranks
frightened
withdrew
gave
way
and
whirled
into
the
interior
of
the
wedge
demoralized
and
not
feeling
themselves
supported
the
ranks
engaged
followed
them
and
the
routed
mass
let
itself
be
slaughtered
the
weapons
fell
from
their
hands
says
polybius
the
analysis
of
cannae
is
ended
before
passing
to
the
recital
of
pharsalus
we
can
not
resist
the
temptation
though
the
matter
be
a
little
foreign
to
the
subject
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
battles
of
hannibal
these
battles
have
a
particular
character
of
stubbornness
explained
by
the
necessity
for
overcoming
the
roman
tenacity
it
may
be
said
that
to
hannibal
victory
was
not
sufficient
he
must
destroy
consequently
he
always
tried
to
cut
off
all
retreat
for
the
enemy
he
knew
that
with
rome
destruction
was
the
only
way
of
finishing
the
struggle
he
did
not
believe
in
the
courage
of
despair
in
the
masses
he
believed
in
terror
and
he
knew
the
value
of
surprise
in
inspiring
it
but
it
was
not
the
losses
of
the
romans
that
was
the
most
surprising
thing
in
these
engagements
it
was
the
losses
of
hannibal
who
before
hannibal
or
after
him
has
lost
as
many
as
the
romans
and
yet
been
conqueror
to
keep
troops
in
action
until
victory
comes
with
such
losses
requires
a
most
powerful
hand
he
inspired
his
people
with
absolute
confidence
almost
always
his
center
where
he
put
his
gauls
his
food
for
powder
was
broken
but
that
did
not
seem
to
disquiet
or
trouble
either
him
or
his
men
it
is
true
that
his
center
was
pierced
by
the
romans
who
were
escaping
the
pressure
of
the
two
carthaginian
wings
that
they
were
in
disorder
because
they
had
fought
and
pushed
back
the
gauls
whom
hannibal
knew
how
to
make
fight
with
singular
tenacity
they
probably
felt
as
though
they
had
escaped
from
a
press
and
happy
to
be
out
of
it
they
thought
only
of
getting
further
away
from
the
battle
and
by
no
means
of
returning
to
the
flanks
or
the
rear
of
the
enemy
in
addition
although
nothing
is
said
about
it
hannibal
had
doubtless
taken
precautions
against
their
ever
returning
to
the
conflict
all
that
is
probably
true
the
confidence
of
the
gallic
troops
so
broken
through
is
none
the
less
surprising
hannibal
in
order
to
inspire
his
people
with
such
confidence
had
to
explain
to
them
before
the
combat
his
plan
of
action
in
such
a
way
that
treachery
could
not
injure
him
he
must
have
warned
his
troops
that
the
center
would
be
pierced
but
that
he
was
not
worried
about
it
because
it
was
a
foreseen
and
prepared
affair
his
troops
indeed
did
not
seem
to
be
worried
about
it
let
us
leave
aside
his
conception
of
campaigns
his
greatest
glory
in
the
eyes
of
all
hannibal
was
the
greatest
general
of
antiquity
by
reason
of
his
admirable
comprehension
of
the
morale
of
combat
of
the
morale
of
the
soldier
whether
his
own
or
the
enemy
he
shows
his
greatness
in
this
respect
in
all
the
different
incidents
of
war
of
campaign
of
action
his
men
were
not
better
than
the
roman
soldiers
they
were
not
as
well
armed
less
in
number
yet
he
was
always
the
conqueror
he
understood
the
value
of
morale
he
had
the
absolute
confidence
of
his
people
in
addition
he
had
the
art
in
commanding
an
army
of
always
securing
the
advantage
of
morale
in
italy
he
had
it
is
true
cavalry
superior
to
that
of
the
romans
but
the
romans
had
a
much
superior
infantry
had
conditions
been
reversed
he
would
have
changed
his
methods
the
instruments
of
battle
are
valuable
only
if
one
knows
how
to
use
them
and
pompey
we
shall
see
was
beaten
at
pharsalus
precisely
because
he
had
a
cavalry
superior
to
that
of
caesar
if
hannibal
was
vanquished
at
zuma
it
was
because
genius
can
not
accomplish
the
impossible
zuma
proved
again
the
perfect
knowledge
of
men
that
hannibal
possessed
and
his
influence
over
the
troops
his
third
line
the
only
one
where
he
really
had
reliable
soldiers
was
the
only
one
that
fought
beset
on
all
sides
it
slew
two
thousand
romans
before
it
was
conquered
we
shall
see
later
what
a
high
state
of
morale
what
desperate
fighting
this
meant
chapter
iv
analysis
of
the
battle
of
pharsalus
and
some
characteristic
examples
here
is
caesar
account
of
the
battle
of
pharsalus
as
caesar
approached
pompey
camp
he
noted
that
pompey
army
was
placed
in
the
following
order
on
the
left
wing
were
the
and
legions
which
caesar
had
sent
to
pompey
at
the
commencement
of
the
operation
pursuant
to
a
decree
of
the
senate
and
which
pompey
had
kept
scipio
occupied
the
center
with
the
legions
from
syria
the
legion
from
cilicia
was
placed
on
the
right
wing
together
with
the
spanish
cohorts
of
afranius
pompey
regarded
the
troops
already
mentioned
as
the
most
reliable
of
his
army
between
them
that
is
between
the
center
and
the
wings
he
had
distributed
the
remainder
consisting
of
one
hundred
and
ten
complete
cohorts
in
line
these
were
made
up
of
thousand
men
two
thousand
of
whom
were
veterans
previously
rewarded
for
their
services
who
had
come
to
join
him
he
had
scattered
them
throughout
the
whole
line
of
battle
seven
cohorts
had
been
left
to
guard
his
camp
and
the
neighboring
forts
his
right
wing
rested
on
a
stream
with
inaccessible
banks
and
for
that
reason
he
had
placed
all
his
seven
thousand
cavalry
his
archers
and
his
slingers
hundred
men
on
the
left
wing
caesar
keeping
his
battle
order
had
placed
the
legion
on
the
right
wing
and
on
the
left
the
which
was
much
weakened
by
the
combats
of
dyrrachium
to
the
latter
he
added
the
in
order
to
form
something
like
a
full
legion
from
the
two
and
ordered
them
to
support
one
another
he
had
eighty
very
completely
organized
cohorts
in
line
approximately
thousand
men
two
cohorts
had
been
left
to
guard
the
camp
caesar
had
entrusted
the
command
of
the
left
wing
to
anthony
that
of
the
right
to
sylla
and
of
the
center
to
domitius
he
placed
himself
in
front
of
pompey
but
when
he
saw
the
disposition
of
the
opposing
army
he
feared
that
his
right
wing
was
going
to
be
enveloped
by
pompey
numerous
cavalry
he
therefore
withdrew
immediately
from
his
third
line
a
cohort
from
each
legion
six
cohorts
in
order
to
form
a
fourth
line
placed
it
to
receive
pompey
cavalry
and
showed
it
what
it
had
to
do
then
he
explained
fully
to
these
cohorts
that
the
success
of
the
day
depended
on
their
valor
at
the
same
time
he
ordered
the
entire
army
and
in
particular
the
third
line
not
to
move
without
his
command
reserving
to
himself
authority
to
give
the
signal
by
means
of
the
standard
when
he
thought
it
opportune
caesar
then
went
through
his
lines
to
exhort
his
men
to
do
well
and
seeing
them
full
of
ardor
had
the
signal
given
between
the
two
armies
there
was
only
enough
space
to
give
each
the
necessary
distance
for
the
charge
but
pompey
had
given
his
men
orders
to
await
the
charge
without
stirring
and
to
let
caesar
army
break
its
ranks
upon
them
he
did
this
they
say
on
the
advice
of
triarius
as
a
method
of
meeting
the
force
of
the
first
dash
of
caesar
men
he
hoped
that
their
battle
order
would
be
broken
up
and
his
own
soldiers
well
disposed
in
ranks
would
have
to
fight
with
sword
in
hand
only
men
in
disorder
he
thought
that
this
formation
would
best
protect
his
troops
from
the
force
of
the
fall
of
heavy
javelins
at
the
same
time
he
hoped
that
caesar
soldiers
charging
at
the
run
would
be
out
of
breath
and
overcome
with
fatigue
at
the
moment
of
contact
pompey
immobility
was
an
error
because
there
is
in
every
one
an
animation
a
natural
ardor
that
is
instilled
by
the
onset
to
the
combat
generals
ought
not
to
check
but
to
encourage
this
ardor
it
was
for
this
reason
that
in
olden
times
troops
charged
with
loud
shouts
all
trumpets
sounding
in
order
to
frighten
the
enemy
and
encourage
themselves
in
the
meanwhile
our
soldiers
at
the
given
signal
advanced
with
javelins
in
hand
but
having
noticed
that
pompey
soldiers
were
not
running
towards
them
and
taught
by
experience
and
trained
by
previous
battles
they
slowed
down
and
stopped
in
the
midst
of
their
run
in
order
not
to
arrive
out
of
breath
and
worn
out
some
moments
after
having
taken
up
their
run
again
they
launched
their
javelins
and
immediately
afterwards
according
to
caesar
order
drew
their
swords
the
pompeians
conducted
themselves
perfectly
they
received
the
darts
courageously
they
did
not
stir
before
the
dash
of
the
legions
they
preserved
their
lines
and
having
dispatched
their
javelins
drew
their
swords
at
the
same
time
pompey
entire
cavalry
dashed
from
the
left
wing
as
had
been
ordered
and
the
mass
of
his
archers
ran
from
all
parts
of
the
line
our
cavalry
did
not
await
the
charge
but
fell
back
a
little
pompey
cavalry
became
more
pressing
and
commenced
to
reform
its
squadrons
and
turn
our
exposed
flank
as
soon
as
caesar
saw
this
intention
he
gave
the
signal
to
the
fourth
line
of
six
cohorts
this
line
started
directly
and
standards
low
they
charged
the
pompeian
cavalry
with
such
vigor
and
resolution
that
not
a
single
man
stood
his
ground
all
wheeled
about
and
not
only
withdrew
in
full
flight
but
gained
the
highest
mountains
as
fast
as
they
could
they
left
the
archers
and
slingers
without
their
defense
and
protection
these
were
all
killed
at
the
same
time
the
cohorts
moved
to
the
rear
of
left
wing
which
was
still
fighting
and
resisting
and
attacked
it
in
rear
meanwhile
caesar
had
advanced
his
third
line
which
up
to
this
moment
had
been
kept
quietly
at
its
post
these
fresh
troops
relieved
those
that
were
fatigued
pompey
men
taken
in
rear
could
no
longer
hold
out
and
all
took
to
flight
caesar
was
not
in
error
when
he
put
these
cohorts
in
a
fourth
line
particularly
charged
with
meeting
the
cavalry
and
urged
them
to
do
well
since
their
effort
would
bring
victory
they
repulsed
the
cavalry
they
cut
to
pieces
the
slingers
and
archers
they
turned
pompey
left
wing
and
this
decided
the
day
when
pompey
saw
his
cavalry
repulsed
and
that
portion
of
the
army
upon
which
he
had
counted
the
most
seized
with
terror
he
had
little
confidence
in
the
rest
he
quit
the
battle
and
galloped
to
his
camp
where
addressing
his
centurions
who
were
guarding
the
praetorian
gate
he
told
them
in
a
loud
voice
heard
by
the
soldiers
well
the
camp
and
defend
it
vigorously
in
case
of
attack
as
for
myself
i
am
going
to
make
the
tour
of
the
other
gates
and
assure
their
defense
that
said
he
retired
to
the
praetorium
despairing
of
success
and
awaiting
events
after
having
forced
the
enemy
to
flee
to
his
entrenchments
caesar
persuaded
that
he
ought
not
to
give
the
slightest
respite
to
a
terrorized
enemy
incited
his
soldiers
to
profit
by
their
advantage
and
attack
the
camp
although
overcome
by
the
heat
for
the
struggle
was
prolonged
into
the
middle
of
the
day
they
did
not
object
to
greater
fatigue
and
obeyed
the
camp
was
at
first
well
defended
by
the
cohorts
on
watch
and
especially
by
the
thracians
and
barbarians
the
men
who
had
fled
from
the
battle
full
of
fright
and
overcome
with
fatigue
had
nearly
all
thrown
their
arms
and
colors
away
and
thought
rather
more
of
saving
themselves
than
of
defending
the
camp
even
those
who
defended
the
entrenchments
were
unable
long
to
resist
the
shower
of
arrows
covered
with
wounds
they
abandoned
the
place
and
led
by
their
centurions
and
tribunes
they
took
refuge
as
quickly
as
they
could
in
the
high
mountains
near
the
camp
caesar
lost
in
this
battle
but
two
hundred
soldiers
but
nearly
thirty
of
the
bravest
centurions
were
killed
therein
of
pompey
army
fifteen
thousand
perished
and
more
than
thousand
took
refuge
in
the
mountains
as
caesar
had
invested
the
mountains
with
entrenchments
they
surrendered
the
following
day
such
is
caesar
account
his
action
is
so
clearly
shown
that
there
is
scarcely
any
need
of
comment
initially
caesar
formation
was
in
three
lines
this
was
the
usual
battle
order
in
the
roman
armies
without
being
absolute
however
since
marius
fought
with
two
only
but
as
we
have
said
according
to
the
occasion
the
genius
of
the
chief
decided
the
battle
formation
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
pompey
army
was
in
a
different
order
of
battle
to
face
that
army
twice
as
large
as
his
caesar
if
he
had
had
to
preserve
the
disposition
of
cohorts
in
ten
ranks
would
have
been
able
to
form
but
one
complete
line
the
first
and
a
second
half
as
numerous
as
a
reserve
but
he
knew
the
bravery
of
his
troops
and
he
knew
the
apparent
force
of
deep
ranks
to
be
a
delusion
he
did
not
hesitate
to
diminish
his
depth
in
order
to
keep
the
formation
and
morale
of
of
his
troops
intact
until
the
moment
of
their
engagement
in
order
to
be
even
more
sure
of
the
third
line
of
his
reserve
and
in
order
to
make
sure
that
it
would
not
be
carried
away
by
its
enthusiasm
for
action
he
paid
it
most
particular
attention
perhaps
the
text
is
doubtful
he
kept
it
at
double
the
usual
distance
in
rear
of
the
fighting
lines
then
to
guard
against
a
turning
movement
by
pompey
seven
thousand
cavalry
and
hundred
slingers
and
archers
a
movement
in
which
pompey
placed
the
hopes
of
victory
caesar
posted
six
cohorts
that
represented
scarcely
two
thousand
men
he
had
perfect
confidence
that
these
two
thousand
men
would
make
pompey
cavalry
wheel
about
and
that
his
one
thousand
horsemen
would
then
press
the
action
so
energetically
that
pompey
cavalry
would
not
even
think
of
rallying
it
happened
so
and
the
hundred
archers
and
slingers
were
slaughtered
like
sheep
by
these
cohorts
aided
without
doubt
by
foot
young
and
agile
whom
caesar
mixed
with
his
thousand
horsemen
and
who
remained
at
this
task
leaving
the
horsemen
whom
they
had
relieved
to
pursue
the
fugitives
thus
were
seven
thousand
horsemen
swept
away
and
hundred
infantrymen
slaughtered
without
a
struggle
all
demoralized
simply
by
a
vigorous
demonstration
the
order
to
await
the
charge
given
by
pompey
to
his
infantry
was
judged
too
severely
by
caesar
caesar
certainly
was
right
as
a
general
rule
the
enthusiasm
of
the
troops
must
not
be
dampened
and
the
initiative
of
the
attack
indeed
gives
to
the
assailant
a
certain
moral
influence
but
with
trusted
soldiers
duly
trained
one
can
try
a
stratagem
and
the
men
of
pompey
had
proven
their
dependability
by
awaiting
on
the
spot
without
stirring
a
vigorous
enemy
in
good
order
when
they
counted
on
meeting
him
in
disorder
and
out
of
breath
though
it
may
not
have
led
to
success
the
advice
of
triarius
was
not
bad
even
the
conduct
of
caesar
men
proves
this
this
battle
shows
the
confidence
of
the
soldier
in
the
material
rank
in
ancient
combat
as
assuring
support
and
mutual
assistance
notwithstanding
the
fact
the
caesar
soldiers
had
the
initiative
in
the
attack
the
first
encounter
decided
nothing
it
was
a
combat
on
the
spot
a
struggle
of
several
hours
thousand
good
troops
lost
scarcely
two
hundred
men
in
this
struggle
for
with
like
arms
courage
and
ability
pompey
infantry
ought
not
to
have
lost
in
fighting
more
than
that
of
caesar
these
same
thousand
men
gave
way
and
merely
between
the
battle
field
and
their
camp
twelve
thousand
were
slaughtered
pompey
men
had
twice
the
depth
of
caesar
ranks
whose
attack
did
not
make
them
fall
back
a
step
on
the
other
hand
their
mass
was
unable
to
repel
him
and
he
was
fought
on
the
spot
pompey
had
announced
to
them
says
caesar
that
the
enemy
army
would
be
turned
by
his
cavalry
and
suddenly
when
they
were
fighting
bravely
step
by
step
they
heard
behind
them
the
shouts
of
attack
by
the
six
cohorts
of
caesar
two
thousand
men
does
it
seem
an
easy
matter
for
such
a
force
to
ward
off
this
menace
no
the
wing
taken
in
rear
in
this
way
loses
ground
more
and
more
the
contagion
of
fear
spreads
to
the
rest
terror
is
so
great
that
they
do
not
think
of
in
their
camp
which
is
defended
for
a
moment
only
by
the
cohorts
on
guard
just
as
at
cannae
their
arms
drop
from
their
hands
but
for
the
good
conduct
of
the
camp
guards
which
permitted
the
fugitives
to
gain
the
mountains
the
thousand
prisoners
of
the
next
day
might
have
been
corpses
that
very
day
cannae
and
pharsalus
are
sufficient
to
illustrate
ancient
combat
let
us
however
add
some
other
characteristic
examples
which
we
shall
select
briefly
and
in
chronological
order
they
will
complete
our
data
livy
relates
that
in
an
action
against
some
of
the
peoples
in
the
neighborhood
of
rome
i
do
not
recall
now
which
the
romans
did
not
dare
to
pursue
for
fear
of
breaking
their
ranks
in
a
fight
against
the
hernici
he
cites
the
roman
horsemen
who
had
not
been
able
to
do
anything
on
horseback
to
break
up
the
enemy
asking
the
consul
for
permission
to
dismount
and
fight
on
foot
this
is
true
not
only
of
roman
cavalrymen
for
later
on
we
shall
see
the
best
riders
the
gauls
the
germans
the
parthanians
even
dismounting
in
order
really
to
fight
the
volsci
the
latini
the
hernici
combined
to
fight
the
romans
and
as
the
action
nears
its
end
livy
relates
finally
the
first
ranks
having
fallen
and
carnage
being
all
about
them
they
threw
away
their
arms
and
started
to
scatter
the
cavalry
then
dashed
forward
with
orders
not
to
kill
the
isolated
ones
but
to
harass
the
mass
with
their
arrows
annoy
it
to
delay
it
to
prevent
dispersion
in
order
to
permit
the
infantry
to
come
up
and
kill
in
hamilcar
engagement
against
the
mercenaries
in
revolt
who
up
to
then
had
always
beaten
the
carthaginians
the
mercenaries
endeavored
to
envelop
him
hamilcar
surprised
them
by
a
new
maneuver
and
defeated
them
he
marched
in
three
lines
elephants
cavalry
and
light
infantry
then
heavily
armed
phalanxes
at
the
approach
of
the
mercenaries
who
were
marching
vigorously
towards
him
the
two
lines
formed
by
the
elephants
the
cavalry
and
light
infantry
turned
about
and
moved
quickly
to
place
themselves
on
the
flanks
of
the
third
line
the
third
line
thus
exposed
met
a
foe
which
had
thought
only
of
pursuit
and
which
the
surprise
put
to
flight
it
thus
abandoned
itself
to
the
action
of
the
elephants
horses
and
the
light
infantry
who
massacred
the
fugitives
hamilcar
killed
six
thousand
men
captured
two
thousand
and
lost
practically
nobody
it
was
a
question
as
to
whether
he
had
lost
a
single
man
since
there
had
been
no
combat
in
the
battle
of
lake
trasimenus
the
carthaginians
lost
fifteen
hundred
men
nearly
all
gauls
the
romans
fifteen
thousand
and
fifteen
thousand
prisoners
the
battle
raged
for
three
hours
at
zama
hannibal
had
twenty
thousand
killed
twenty
thousand

the

two
thousand

this
was
a
serious
struggle
in
which
hannibal
third
line
alone
fought
it
gave

only
under
the
attack
on
its
rear
and

eighty

at

the

but
gaps
occurred
from
the
resistance
that
it
encountered
hundreds
penetrated
into
the
gaps
in
the
phalanx
and
killed
the
men
embarrassed
with
their
long
pikes
they
were
effective
only
when
united
abreast
and
at
shaft
length
there
was
frightful
disorder
and
butchery
twenty
thousand
killed
five
thousand
captured
out

the
historian
does
not
deem
it
worth
while
to
speak
of
the
roman
losses
after
the
battle
of
aix
against
the
teutons
marius
surprised
the
teutons
from

was
frightful

archelaus
was
beaten
by

the

lost
fourteen

and
killed
their
enemies
until
worn
out
in
pursuit
the
battle
of
orchomenus
against
archelaus
was
a
repetition
of
chaeronea
caesar
states
that
his
cavalry
could
not
fight
the
britons
without
greatly
exposing
itself
because
they
pretended
flight
in
order
to
get
the
cavalry
away
from
the
infantry
and
then
dashing
from
their
chariots
they
fought
on
foot
with
advantage
a
little
less
than
two
hundred
veterans
embarked
on
a
boat
which
they
ran
aground
at
night
so
as
not
to
be
taken
by
superior
naval
forces
they
reached
an
advantageous
position
and
passed
the
night
at
the
break
of
day
otacilius
dispatched
some
four
hundred
horsemen
and
some
infantry
from
the
alesio
garrison
against

they
defended
themselves
bravely
and
having
killed
some
they
rejoined
troops
without
having
lost
a
single

in
macedonia
caesar
was
caught
by
pompey
cavalry
at
the
passage
of
the
genusus
river
the
banks
of
which
were
quite
steep
caesar
opposed
pompey
cavalry
five
to
seven
thousand
strong
with
his
cavalry
of
six
hundred
to
one
thousand
men
among
which
he
had
taken
care
to
intermingle
four
hundred
picked
infantrymen
they
did
their
duty
so
well
that
in
the
combat
that
followed
they
repulsed
the
enemy
killed
many
and
fell
back
upon
their
own
army
without
the
loss
of
a
single
man
in
the
battle
of
thapsus
in
africa
against
scipio
caesar
killed
ten
thousand
lost
fifty
and
had
some
wounded
in
the
battle
under
the
walls
of
munda
in

against
one
of
pompey
sons
caesar
had
eighty
cohorts
and
eight
thousand

in
all
about
eighty
thousand
men
the
struggle
says
the
narrator
was
valiantly
kept
up
step
by
step
sword
to
sword
in
that
battle
of
exceptional
fury
which
hung
for
a
long
time
in
the
balance
caesar
had
one
thousand
dead
five
hundred
wounded
pompey
thousand
dead
and
if
munda
had
not
been
so
near
scarcely
two
miles
away
his
losses
would
have
been
doubled
the
defensive
works
of
munda
were
constructed
from
dead
bodies
and
abandoned
arms
in
studying
ancient
combats
it
can
be
seen
that
it
was
almost
always
an
attack
from
the
flank
or
rear
a
surprise
action
that
won
battles
especially
against
the
romans
it
was
in
this
way
that
their
excellent
tactics
might
be
confused
roman
tactics
were
so
excellent
that
a
roman
general
who
was
only
half
as
good
as
his
adversary
was
sure
to
be
victorious
by
surprise
alone
they
could
be
conquered
note
xanthippe
hannibal
the
unexpected
fighting
methods
of
the
gauls
etc
indeed
xenophon
says
somewhere
be
it
agreeable
or
terrible
the
less
anything
is
foreseen
the
more
does
it
cause
pleasure
or
dismay
this
is
nowhere
better
illustrated
than
in
war
where
every
surprise
strikes
terror
even
to
those
who
are
much
the
stronger
but
very
few
fighters
armed
with
cuirass
and
shield
were
killed
in
the
front
lines
hannibal
in
his
victories
lost
almost
nobody
but
gauls
his
who
fought
with
poor
shields
and
without
armor
nearly
always
driven
in
they
fought
nevertheless
with
a
tenacity
that
they
never
showed
under
any
other
command
thucydides
characterizes
the
combat
of
the
lightly
armed
by
saying
as
a
rule
the
lightly
armed
of
both
sides
took
to
flight
in
combat
with
closed
ranks
there
was
mutual
pressure
but
little
loss
the
men
not
being
at
liberty
to
strike
in
their
own
way
and
with
all
their
force
caesar
against
the
nervii
saw
his
men
who
in
the
midst
of
the
action
had
instinctively
closed
in
mass
in
order
to
resist
the
mass
of
barbarians
giving
way
under
pressure
he
therefore
ordered
his
ranks
and
files
to
open
so
that
his
legionaries
closed
in
mass
paralyzed
and
forced
to
give
way
to
a
very
strong
pressure
might
be
able
to
kill
and
consequently
demoralize
the
enemy
and
indeed
as
soon
as
a
man
in
the
front
rank
of
the
nervii
fell
under
the
blows
of
the
legionaries
there
was
a
halt
a
falling
back
following
an
attack
from
the
rear
and
a
mêlée
the
defeat
of
the
nervii
ensued
chapter
v
morale
in
ancient
battle
we
now
know
the
morale
and
mechanism
of
ancient
fighting
the
word
mêlée
employed
by
the
ancients
was
many
times
stronger
than
the
idea
to
be
expressed
it
meant
a
crossing
of
arms
not
a
confusion
of
men
the
results
of
battles
such
as
losses
suffice
to
demonstrate
this
and
an
instant
of
reflection
makes
us
see
the
error
of
the
word
mêlée
in
pursuit
it
was
possible
to
plunge
into
the
midst
of
the
fugitives
but
in
combat
every
one
had
too
much
need
for
the
next
man
for
his
neighbor
who
was
guarding
his
flanks
and
his
back
to
let
himself
be
killed
out
of
sheer
wantonness
by
a
sure
blow
from
within
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
in
the
confusion
of
a
real
mêlée
caesar
at
pharsalus
and
hannibal
at
cannae
would
have
been
conquered
their
shallow
ranks
penetrated
by
the
enemy
would
have
had
to
fight
two
against
one
they
would
even
have
been
taken
in
rear
in
consequence
of
the
breaking
of
their
ranks
also
has
there
not
been
seen
in
troops
equally
reliable
and
desperate
that
mutual
weariness
which
brings
about
with
tacit
accord
falling
back
for
a
breathing
spell
on
both
sides
in
order
again
to
take
up
the
battle
how
can
this
be
possible
with
a
mêlée
with
the
confusion
and
medley
of
combatants
there
might
be
a
mutual
extermination
but
there
would
not
be
any
victors
how
would
they
recognize
each
other
can
you
conceive
two
mixed
masses
of
men
or
groups
where
every
one
occupied
in
front
can
be
struck
with
impunity
from
the
side
or
from
behind
that
is
mutual
extermination
where
victory
belongs
only
to
survivors
for
in
the
and
confusion
no
one
can
flee
no
one
knows
where
to
flee
after
all
are
not
the
losses
we
have
seen
on
both
sides
demonstration
that
there
was
no
real
mêlée
the
word
is
therefore
too
strong
the
imagination
of
painters
and
poets
has
created
the
mêlée
this
is
what
happened
at
a
charging
distance
troops
marched
towards
the
enemy
with
all
the
speed
compatible
with
the
necessity
for
fencing
and
mutual
aid
quite
often
the
moral
impulse
that
resolution
to
go
to
the
end
manifested
itself
at
once
in
the
order
and
freedom
of
gait
that
impulse
alone
put
to
flight
a
less
resolute
adversary
it
was
customary
among
good
troops
to
have
a
clash
but
not
the
blind
and
headlong
onset
of
the
mass
the
preoccupation
of
the
rank
was
very
great
as
the
behavior
of
caesar
troops
at
pharsalus
shows
in
their
slow
march
timed
by
the
flutes
of
lacedaemonian
battalions
at
the
moment
of
getting
close
to
the
enemy
the
dash
slackened
of
its
own
accord
because
the
men
of
the
first
rank
of
necessity
and
instinctively
assured
themselves
of
the
position
of
their
supports
their
neighbors
in
the
same
line
their
comrades
in
the
second
and
collected
themselves
together
in
order
to
be
more
the
masters
of
their
movements
to
strike
and
parry
there
was
a
contact
of
man
with
man
each
took
the
adversary
in
front
of
him
and
attacked
him
because
by
penetrating
into
the
ranks
before
having
struck
him
down
he
risked
being
wounded
in
the
side
by
losing
his
flank
supports
each
one
then
hit
his
man
with
his
shield
expecting
to
make
him
lose
his
equilibrium
and
at
the
instant
he
tried
to
recover
himself
landed
the
blow
the
men
in
the
second
line
back
of
the
intervals
necessary
for
fencing
in
the
first
were
ready
to
protect
their
sides
against
any
one
that
advanced
between
them
and
were
prepared
to
relieve
tired
warriors
it
was
the
same
in
the
third
line
and
so
on
every
one
being
supported
on
either
side
the
first
encounter
was
rarely
decisive
and
the
fencing
the
real
combat
at
close
quarters
began
if
men
of
the
first
line
were
wounded
quickly
if
the
other
ranks
were
not
in
a
hurry
to
relieve
or
replace
them
or
if
there
was
hesitation
defeat
followed
this
happened
to
the
romans
in
their
first
encounters
with
the
gauls
the
gaul
with
his
shield
parried
the
first
thrust
brought
his
big
iron
sword
swooping
down
with
fury
upon
the
top
of
the
roman
shield
split
it
and
went
after
the
man
the
romans
already
hesitating
before
the
moral
impulse
of
the
gauls
their
ferocious
yells
their
nudeness
an
indication
of
a
contempt
for
wounds
fell
then
in
a
greater
number
than
their
adversaries
and
demoralization
followed
soon
they
accustomed
themselves
to
this
valorous
but
not
tenacious
spirit
of
their
enemies
and
when
they
had
protected
the
top
of
their
shields
with
an
iron
band
they
no
longer
fell
and
the
rôles
were
changed
the
gauls
in
fact
were
unable
either
to
hold
their
ground
against
the
better
arms
and
the
thrusts
of
the
romans
or
against
their
individual
superior
tenacity
increased
nearly
tenfold
by
the
possible
relay
of
eight
ranks
of
the
maniple
the
maniples
were
whereas
with
the
gauls
the
duration
of
the
combat
was
limited
to
the
strength
of
a
single
man
on
account
of
the
difficulties
of
close
or
tumultuous
ranks
and
the
impossibility
of
replacing
losses
when
they
were
fighting
at
close
quarters
if
the
weapons
were
nearly
alike
preserving
ranks
and
thereby
breaking
down
driving
back
and
confusing
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
was
to
conquer
the
man
in
disordered
broken
lines
no
longer
felt
himself
supported
but
vulnerable
everywhere
and
he
fled
it
is
true
that
it
is
hardly
possible
to
break
hostile
lines
without
doing
the
same
with
one
own
but
the
one
who
breaks
through
first
has
been
able
to
do
so
only
by
making
the
foe
fall
back
before
his
blows
by
killing
or
wounding
he
has
thereby
raised
his
courage
and
that
of
his
neighbor
he
knows
he
sees
where
he
is
marching
whilst
the
adversary
overtaken
as
a
consequence
of
the
retreat
or
the
fall
of
the
troops
that
were
flanking
him
is
surprised
he
sees
himself
exposed
on
the
flank
he
falls
back
on
a
line
with
the
rank
in
rear
in
order
to
regain
support
but
the
lines
in
the
rear
give
way
to
the
retreat
of
the
first
if
the
withdrawal
has
a
certain
duration
terror
comes
as
a
result
of
the
blows
which
drive
back
and
mow
down
the
first
line
if
to
make
room
for
those
pushed
back
the
last
lines
turn
their
backs
there
is
small
chance
that
they
will
face
the
front
again
space
has
tempted
them
they
will
not
return
to
the
fight
then
by
that
natural
instinct
of
the
soldier
to
worry
to
assure
himself
of
his
supports
the
contagion
of
flight
spreads
from
the
last
ranks
to
the
first
the
first
closely
engaged
has
been
held
to
the
fight
in
the
meantime
under
pain
of
immediate
death
there
is
no
need
to
explain
what
follows
it
is
butchery
caedes
but
to
return
to
combat
it
is
evident
that
the
formation
of
troops
in
a
straight
line
drawn
close
together
existed
scarcely
an
instant
moreover
each
group
of
files
formed
in
action
was
connected
with
the
next
group
the
groups
like
the
individuals
were
always
concerned
about
their
support
the
fight
took
place
along
the
line
of
contact
of
the
first
ranks
of
the
army
a
straight
line
broken
curved
and
bent
in
different
directions
according
to
the
various
chances
of
the
action
at
such
or
such
a
point
but
always
restricting
and
separating
the
combatants
of
the
two
sides
once
engaged
on
that
line
it
was
necessary
to
face
the
front
under
pain
of
immediate
death
naturally
and
necessarily
every
one
in
these
first
ranks
exerted
all
his
energy
to
defend
his
life
at
no
point
did
the
line
become
entangled
as
long
as
there
was
fighting
for
general
or
soldier
the
effort
of
each
one
was
to
keep
up
the
continuity
of
support
all
along
the
line
and
to
break
or
cut
that
of
the
enemy
because
victory
then
followed
we
see
then
that
between
men
armed
with
swords
it
was
possible
to
have
and
there
was
if
the
combat
was
serious
penetration
of
one
mass
into
the
other
but
never
confusion
or
a
jumble
of
ranks
by
the
men
forming
these
masses
sword
to
sword
combat
was
the
most
deadly
it
presented
the
most
sudden
changes
because
it
was
the
one
in
which
the
individual
valor
and
dexterity
of
the
combatant
had
the
greatest
and
most
immediate
influence
other
methods
of
combat
were
simpler
let
us
compare
pikes
and
broadswords
the
close
formation
of
men
armed
with
pikes
was
irresistible
so
long
as
it
was
maintained
a
forest
of
pikes
fifteen
to
eighteen
feet
long
kept
you
at
a
distance
on
the
other
hand
it
was
easy
to
kill
off
the
cavalry
and
light
infantry
about
the
phalanx
which
was
an
unwieldy
mass
marching
with
a
measured
step
and
which
a
mobile
body
of
troops
could
always
avoid
openings
in
the
phalanx
might
be
occasioned
by
marching
by
the
terrain
by
the
thousand
accidents
of
struggle
by
the
individual
assault
of
brave
men
by
the
wounded
on
the
ground
creeping
under
the
high
held
pikes
and
cutting
at
the
legs
of
the
front
rank
men
in
the
phalanx
could
scarcely
see
and
even
the
first
two
lines
hardly
had
a
free
position
for
striking
the
men
were
armed
with
long
lances
useless
at
close
quarters
good
only
for
combat
at
shaft
length
polybius
they
were
struck
with
impunity
by
the
groups
which
threw
themselves
into
the
intervals
and
then
once
the
enemy
was
in
the
body
of
the
phalanx
morale
disappeared
and
it
became
a
mass
without
order
a
flock
of
sheep
falling
over
each
other
in
a
mob
men
prick
with
their
knives
those
who
press
them
the
contagion
of
fear
changes
the
direction
of
the
human
wave
it
bends
back
upon
itself
and
breaks
to
escape
danger
if
then
the
enemy
fled
before
the
phalanx
there
was
no
mêlée
if
he
gave
way
tactically
before
it
and
availing
himself
of
gaps
penetrated
it
by
groups
still
there
was
no
mêlée
or
mixture
of
ranks
the
wedge
entering
into
a
mass
does
not
become
intermingled
with
it
with
a
phalanx
armed
with
long
pikes
against
a
similar
phalanx
there
was
still
less
confusion
they
were
able
to
stand
for
a
long
time
if
the
one
did
not
take
the
other
in
flank
or
in
rear
by
a
detached
body
of
troops
in
all
ancient
combat
even
in
victory
achieved
by
methods
which
affected
the
morale
such
methods
are
always
effective
for
man
does
not
change
it
is
unnecessary
to
repeat
that
in
ancient
conflicts
demoralization
and
flight
began
in
the
rear
ranks
we
have
tried
to
analyze
the
fight
of
infantry
of
the
line
because
its
action
alone
was
decisive
in
ancient
combat
the
light
infantry
of
both
sides
took
to
flight
as
thucydides
states
they
returned
later
to
pursue
and
massacre
the
vanquished
in
cavalry
against
cavalry
the
moral
effect
of
a
mass
charging
in
good
order
was
of
the
greatest
influence
we
rarely
see
two
cavalry
organizations
neither
of
which
breaks
before
such
reciprocal
action
such
action
was
seen
on
the
tecinus
and
at
cannae
engagements
cited
merely
because
they
are
very
rare
exceptions
and
even
in
these
cases
there
was
no
shock
at
full
speed
but
a
halt
face
to
face
and
then
an
engagement
the
hurricanes
of
cavalry
of
those
days
were
poetic
figures
they
had
no
reality
in
an
encounter
at
full
speed
men
and
horses
would
be
crushed
and
neither
men
nor
horses
wished
such
an
encounter
the
hands
of
the
cavalrymen
reined
back
the
instinct
of
men
and
horses
was
to
slacken
to
stop
if
the
enemy
himself
did
not
stop
and
to
make
an
about
if
he
continued
to
advance
and
if
ever
they
met
the
encounter
was
so
weakened
by
the
hands
of
the
men
the
rearing
of
the
horses
the
swinging
of
heads
that
it
was
a
face
to
face
stop
some
blows
were
exchanged
with
the
sword
or
the
lance
but
the
equilibrium
was
too
unstable
mutual
support
too
uncertain
for
real
sword
play
man
felt
himself
too
isolated
the
moral
pressure
was
too
strong
although
not
deadly
the
combat
lasted
but
a
second
precisely
because
man
felt
himself
saw
himself
alone
and
surrounded
the
first
men
who
believed
themselves
no
longer
supported
could
no
longer
endure
uneasiness
they
wheeled
about
and
the
rest
followed
unless
the
enemy
had
also
turned
he
then
pursued
at
his
pleasure
until
checked
by
other
cavalry
which
pursued
him
in
turn
there
never
was
an
encounter
between
cavalry
and
infantry
the
cavalry
harassed
with
its
arrows
with
the
lance
perhaps
while
passing
rapidly
but
it
never
attacked
close
conflict
on
horseback
did
not
exist
and
to
be
sure
if
the
horse
by
adding
so
much
to
the
mobility
of
man
gave
him
the
means
of
menacing
and
charging
with
swiftness
it
permitted
him
to
escape
with
like
rapidity
when
his
menace
did
not
shake
the
enemy
man
by
using
the
horse
pursuant
to
his
natural
inclination
and
sane
reasoning
could
do
as
much
damage
as
possible
while
risking
the
least
possible
to
riders
without
stirrups
or
saddle
for
whom
the
throwing
of
the
javelin
was
a
difficult
matter
xenophon
combat
was
but
a
succession
of
reciprocal
harassings
demonstrations
menaces
skirmishes
with
arrows
each
cavalry
sought
an
opportunity
to
surprise
to
intimidate
to
avail
itself
of
disorder
and
to
pursue
either
the
cavalry
or
the
infantry
then
vae
victis
the
sword
worked
man
always
has
had
the
greatest
fear
of
being
trampled
upon
by
horses
that
fear
has
certainly
routed
a
hundred
thousand
times
more
men
than
the
real
encounter
this
was
always
more
or
less
avoided
by
the
horse
and
no
one
was
knocked
down
when
two
ancient
cavalry
forces
wanted
really
to
fight
were
forced
to
it
they
fought
on
foot
note
the
tecinus
cannae
examples
of
livy
i
find
but
little
real
fighting
on
horseback
in
all
antiquity
like
that
of
alexander
the
great
at
the
passage
of
the
granicus
was
even
that
fighting
his
cavalry
which
traversed
a
river
with
steep
banks
defended
by
the
enemy
lost
men
the
persian
cavalry
one
thousand
and
both
were
equally
well
armed
the
fighting
of
the
middle
ages
revived
the
ancient
battles
except
in
science
cavalrymen
attacked
each
other
perhaps
more
than
the
ancient
cavalry
did
for
the
reason
that
they
were
invulnerable
it
was
not
sufficient
to
throw
them
down
it
was
necessary
to
kill
when
once
they
were
on
the
ground
they
knew
however
that
their
fighting
on
horseback
was
not
important
so
far
as
results
were
concerned
for
when
they
wished
really
to
battle
they
fought
on
foot
note
the
combat
of
the
thirty
bayard
etc
the
victors
arrayed
in
iron
from
head
to
foot
lost
no
one
the
peasants
did
not
count
if
the
vanquished
was
taken
he
was
not
massacred
because
chivalry
had
established
a
fraternity
of
arms
between
noblemen
the
mounted
warriors
of
different
nations
and
ransom
replaced
death
if
we
have
spoken
especially
of
the
infantry
fight
it
is
because
it
was
the
most
serious
on
foot
on
horseback
on
the
bridge
of
a
vessel
at
the
moment
of
danger
the
same
man
is
always
found
any
one
who
knows
him
well
deduces
from
his
action
in
the
past
what
his
action
will
be
in
the
future
chapter
vi
under
what
conditions
real
combatants
are
obtained
and
how
the
fighting
of
our
days
in
order
to
be
well
done
requires
them
to
be
more
dependable
than
in
ancient
combat
let
us
repeat
now
what
we
said
at
the
beginning
of
this
study
man
does
not
enter
battle
to
fight
but
for
victory
he
does
everything
that
he
can
to
avoid
the
first
and
obtain
the
second
the
continued
improvement
of
all
appliances
of
war
has
no
other
goal
than
the
annihilation
of
the
enemy
absolute
bravery
which
does
not
refuse
battle
even
on
unequal
terms
trusting
only
to
god
or
to
destiny
is
not
natural
in
man
it
is
the
result
of
moral
culture
it
is
infinitely
rare
because
in
the
face
of
danger
the
animal
sense
of
always
gains
the
upper
hand
man
calculates
his
chances
with
what
errors
we
are
about
to
see
now
man
has
a
horror
of
death
in
the
bravest
a
great
sense
of
duty
which
they
alone
are
capable
of
understanding
and
living
up
to
is
paramount
but
the
mass
always
cowers
at
sight
of
the
phantom
death
discipline
is
for
the
purpose
of
dominating
that
horror
by
a
still
greater
horror
that
of
punishment
or
disgrace
but
there
always
comes
an
instant
when
natural
horror
gets
an
upper
hand
over
discipline
and
the
fighter
flees
stop
stop
hold
out
a
few
minutes
an
instant
more
and
you
are
victor
you
are
not
even
wounded
yet
if
you
turn
your
back
you
are
dead
he
does
not
hear
he
can
not
hear
any
more
he
is
full
of
fear
how
many
armies
have
sworn
to
conquer
or
perish
how
many
have
kept
their
oaths
an
oath
of
sheep
to
stand
up
against
wolves
history
shows
not
armies
but
firm
souls
who
have
fought
unto
death
and
the
devotion
of
thermopylae
is
therefore
justly
immortal
here
we
are
again
brought
to
the
consideration
of
essential
truths
enunciated
by
many
men
now
forgotten
or
unknown
to
insure
success
in
the
rude
test
of
conflict
it
is
not
sufficient
to
have
a
mass
composed
of
valiant
men
like
the
gauls
or
the
germans
the
mass
needs
and
we
give
it
leaders
who
have
the
firmness
and
decision
of
command
proceeding
from
habit
and
an
entire
faith
in
their
unquestionable
right
to
command
as
established
by
tradition
law
and
society
we
add
good
arms
we
add
methods
of
fighting
suitable
to
these
arms
and
those
of
the
enemy
and
which
do
not
overtax
the
physical
and
moral
forces
of
man
we
add
also
a
rational
decentralization
that
permits
the
direction
and
employment
of
the
efforts
of
all
even
to
the
last
man
we
animate
with
passion
a
violent
desire
for
independence
a
religious
fanaticism
national
pride
a
love
of
glory
a
madness
for
possession
an
iron
discipline
which
permits
no
one
to
escape
action
secures
the
greatest
unity
from
top
to
bottom
between
all
the
elements
between
the
commanding
officers
between
the
commanding
officers
and
men
between
the
soldiers
have
we
then
a
solid
army
not
yet
unity
that
first
and
supreme
force
of
armies
is
sought
by
enacting
severe
laws
of
discipline
supported
by
powerful
passions
but
to
order
discipline
is
not
enough
a
vigilance
from
which
no
one
may
escape
in
combat
should
assure
the
maintenance
of
discipline
discipline
itself
depends
on
moral
pressure
which
actuates
men
to
advance
from
sentiments
of
fear
or
pride
but
it
depends
also
on
surveillance
the
mutual
supervision
of
groups
of
men
who
know
each
other
well
a
wise
organization
insures
that
the
personnel
of
combat
groups
changes
as
little
as
possible
so
that
comrades
in
peace
time
maneuvers
shall
be
comrades
in
war
from
living
together
and
obeying
the
same
chiefs
from
commanding
the
same
men
from
sharing
fatigue
and
rest
from
coöperation
among
men
who
quickly
understand
each
other
in
the
execution
of
warlike
movements
may
be
bred
brotherhood
professional
knowledge
sentiment
above
all
unity
the
duty
of
obedience
the
right
of
imposing
discipline
and
the
impossibility
of
escaping
from
it
would
naturally
follow
and
now
confidence
appears
it
is
not
that
enthusiastic
and
thoughtless
confidence
of
tumultous
or
unprepared
armies
which
goes
up
to
the
danger
point
and
vanishes
rapidly
giving
way
to
a
contrary
sentiment
which
sees
treason
everywhere
it
is
that
intimate
confidence
firm
and
conscious
which
does
not
forget
itself
in
the
heat
of
action
and
which
alone
makes
true
combatants
then
we
have
an
army
and
it
is
no
longer
difficult
to
explain
how
men
carried
away
by
passions
even
men
who
know
how
to
die
without
flinching
without
turning
pale
really
strong
in
the
presence
of
death
but
without
discipline
without
solid
organization
are
vanquished
by
others
individually
less
valiant
but
firmly
jointly
and
severally
combined
one
loves
to
picture
an
armed
mob
upsetting
all
obstacles
and
carried
away
by
a
blast
of
passion
there
is
more
imagination
than
truth
in
that
picture
if
the
struggle
depended
on
individuals
the
courageous
impassioned
men
composing
the
mob
would
have
more
chance
of
victory
but
in
any
body
of
troops
in
front
of
the
enemy
every
one
understands
that
the
task
is
not
the
work
of
one
alone
that
to
complete
it
requires
team
work
with
his
comrades
in
danger
brought
together
under
unknown
leaders
he
feels
the
lack
of
union
and
asks
himself
if
he
can
count
on
them
a
thought
of
mistrust
leads
to
hesitation
a
moment
of
it
will
kill
the
offensive
spirit
unity
and
confidence
can
not
be
improvised
they
alone
can
create
that
mutual
trust
that
feeling
of
force
which
gives
courage
and
daring
courage
that
is
the
temporary
domination
of
will
over
instinct
brings
about
victory
unity
alone
then
produces
fighters
but
as
in
everything
there
are
degrees
of
unity
let
us
see
whether
modern
is
in
this
respect
less
exacting
than
ancient
combat
in
ancient
combat
there
was
danger
only
at
close
quarters
if
the
troops
had
enough
morale
which
asiatic
hordes
seldom
had
to
meet
the
enemy
at
broadsword
length
there
was
an
engagement
whoever
was
that
close
knew
that
he
would
be
killed
if
he
turned
his
back
because
as
we
have
seen
the
victors
lost
but
few
and
the
vanquished
were
exterminated
this
simple
reasoning
held
the
men
and
made
them
fight
if
it
was
but
for
an
instant
neglecting
the
exceptional
and
very
rare
circumstances
which
may
bring
two
forces
together
action
is
brought
on
and
fought
out
from
afar
danger
begins
at
great
distances
and
it
is
necessary
to
advance
for
a
long
time
under
fire
which
at
each
step
becomes
heavier
the
vanquished
loses
prisoners
but
often
in
dead
and
in
wounded
he
does
not
lose
more
than
the
victor
ancient
combat
was
fought
in
groups
close
together
within
a
small
space
in
open
ground
in
full
view
of
one
another
without
the
deafening
noise
of
present
day
arms
men
in
formation
marched
into
an
action
that
took
place
on
the
spot
and
did
not
carry
them
thousands
of
feet
away
from
the
starting
point
the
surveillance
of
the
leaders
was
easy
individual
weakness
was
immediately
checked
general
consternation
alone
caused
flight
fighting
is
done
over
immense
spaces
along
thinly
drawn
out
lines
broken
every
instant
by
the
accidents
and
the
obstacles
of
the
terrain
from
the
time
the
action
begins
as
soon
as
there
are
rifle
shots
the
men
spread
out
as
skirmishers
or
lost
in
the
inevitable
disorder
of
a
rapid
march
escape
the
supervision
of
their
commanding
officers
a
considerable
number
conceal
themselves
they
get
away
from
the
engagement
and
diminish
by
just
so
much
the
material
and
moral
effect
and
confidence
of
the
brave
ones
who
remain
this
can
bring
about
defeat
but
let
us
look
at
man
himself
in
ancient
combat
and
in
modern
in
ancient
combat
i
am
strong
apt
vigorous
trained
full
of
calmness
presence
of
mind
i
have
good
offensive
and
defensive
weapons
and
trustworthy
companions
of
long
standing
they
do
not
let
me
be
overwhelmed
without
aiding
me
i
with
them
they
with
me
we
are
invincible
even
invulnerable
we
have
fought
twenty
battles
and
not
one
of
us
remained
on
the
field
it
is
necessary
to
support
each
other
in
time
we
see
it
clearly
we
are
quick
to
replace
ourselves
to
put
a
fresh
combatant
in
front
of
a
fatigued
adversary
we
are
the
legions
of
marius
fifty
thousand
who
have
held
out
against
the
furious
avalanches
of
the
cimbri
we
have
killed
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
taken
prisoner
sixty
thousand
while
losing
but
two
or
three
hundred
of
our
inexperienced
soldiers
as
strong
firm
trained
and
courageous
as
i
am
i
can
never
say
i
shall
return
i
have
no
longer
to
do
with
men
whom
i
do
not
fear
i
have
to
do
with
fate
in
the
form
of
iron
and
lead
death
is
in
the
air
invisible
and
blind
whispering
whistling
as
brave
good
trustworthy
and
devoted
as
my
companions
may
be
they
do
not
shield
me
only
and
this
is
abstract
and
less
immediately
intelligible
to
all
than
the
material
support
of
ancient
combat
only
i
imagine
that
the
more
numerous
we
are
who
run
a
dangerous
risk
the
greater
is
the
chance
for
each
to
escape
therefrom
i
also
know
that
if
we
have
that
confidence
which
none
of
us
should
lack
in
action
we
feel
and
we
are
stronger
we
begin
more
resolutely
are
ready
to
keep
up
the
struggle
longer
and
therefore
finish
it
more
quickly
we
finish
it
but
in
order
to
finish
it
it
is
necessary
to
advance
to
attack
the
enemy
and
infantryman
or
troopers
we
are
naked
against
iron
naked
against
lead
which
can
not
miss
at
close
range
let
us
advance
in
any
case
resolutely
our
adversary
will
not
stand
at
the
range
of
our
rifle
for
the
attack
is
never
mutual
we
are
sure
of
that
we
have
been
told
so
a
thousand
times
we
have
seen
it
but
what
if
matters
should
change
now
suppose
the
enemy
stands
at
range
what
of
that
how
far
this
is
from
roman
confidence
in
another
place
we
have
shown
that
in
ancient
times
to
retire
from
action
was
both
a
difficult
and
perilous
matter
for
the
soldier
the
temptation
is
much
stronger
the
facility
greater
and
the
peril
less
now
therefore
combat
exacts
more
moral
cohesion
greater
unity
than
previously
a
last
remark
on
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
it
will
complete
the
demonstration
since
the
invention
of
fire
arms
the
musket
the
rifle
the
cannon
the
distances
of
mutual
aid
and
support
have
increased
among
the
different
arms
besides
the
facility
of
communications
of
all
kinds
permits
the
assembling
on
a
given
territory
of
enormous
forces
for
these
reasons
as
we
have
stated
battle
fields
have
become
immense
supervision
becomes
more
and
more
difficult
direction
being
more
distant
tends
more
often
to
escape
from
the
supreme
commanders
and
the
subordinate
leaders
the
certain
and
inevitable
disorder
which
a
body
of
troops
always
presents
in
action
is
with
the
moral
effect
of
modern
appliances
becoming
greater
every
day
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
and
the
vacillation
of
firing
lines
men
and
commanding
officers
often
lose
each
other
troops
immediately
and
hotly
engaged
such
as
companies
and
squads
can
maintain
themselves
only
if
they
are
and
serve
as
supports
or
rallying
points
to
those
out
of
place
battles
tend
to
become
now
more
than
they
have
ever
been
the
battles
of
men
this
ought
not
to
be
true
perhaps
but
the
fact
is
that
it
is
true
not
all
troops
are
immediately
or
hotly
engaged
in
battle
commanding
officers
always
try
to
keep
in
hand
as
long
as
possible
some
troops
capable
of
marching
acting
at
any
moment
in
any
direction
like
yesterday
like
the
decisive
action
is
that
of
formed
troops
victory
belongs
to
the
commander
who
has
known
how
to
keep
them
in
good
order
to
hold
them
and
to
direct
them
that
is
incontrovertible
but
commanders
can
hold
out
decisive
reserves
only
if
the
enemy
has
been
forced
to
commit
his
in
troops
which
do
the
fighting
the
men
and
the
officers
closest
to
them
from
corporal
to
battalion
commander
have
a
more
independent
action
than
ever
as
it
is
alone
the
vigor
of
that
action
more
independent
than
ever
of
the
direction
of
higher
commanders
which
leaves
in
the
hands
of
higher
commanders
available
forces
which
can
be
directed
at
a
decisive
moment
that
action
becomes
more
preponderant
than
ever
battles
now
more
than
ever
are
battles
of
men
of
captains
they
always
have
been
in
fact
since
in
the
last
analysis
the
execution
belongs
to
the
man
in
ranks
but
the
influence
of
the
latter
on
the
final
result
is
greater
than
formerly
from
that
comes
the
maxim
of
the
battles
of
men
outside
of
the
regulations
on
tactics
and
discipline
there
is
an
evident
necessity
for
combating
the
hazardous
predominance
of
the
action
of
the
soldier
over
that
of
the
commander
it
is
necessary
to
delay
as
long
as
possible
that
instant
which
modern
conditions
tend
to
hasten
the
instant
when
the
soldier
gets
from
under
the
control
of
the
commander
this
completes
the
demonstration
of
the
truth
stated
before
combat
requires
in
order
to
give
the
best
results
a
moral
cohesion
a
unity
more
binding
than
at
any
other
time
it
is
as
true
as
it
is
clear
that
if
one
does
not
wish
bonds
to
break
one
must
make
them
elastic
in
order
to
strengthen
them
chapter
vii
purpose
of
this
study
what
would
be
necessary
to
complete
it
any
other
deductions
on
this
subject
must
come
from
the
meditations
of
the
reader
to
be
of
value
in
actual
application
such
deductions
should
be
based
upon
study
of
modern
combat
and
that
study
can
not
be
made
from
the
accounts
of
historians
alone
the
latter
show
the
action
of
troop
units
only
in
a
general
way
action
in
detail
and
the
individual
action
of
the
soldier
remain
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
dust
in
narratives
as
in
reality
yet
these
questions
must
be
studied
for
the
conditions
they
reveal
should
be
the
basis
of
all
fighting
methods
past
present
and
future
where
can
data
on
these
questions
be
found
we
have
very
few
records
portraying
action
as
clearly
as
the
report
on
the
engagement
at
the
pont
de
by
colonel
bugeaud
such
stories
in
even
greater
detail
for
the
smallest
detail
has
its
importance
secured
from
participants
and
witnesses
who
knew
how
to
see
and
knew
how
to
remember
are
what
is
necessary
in
a
study
of
the
battle
of
the
number
of
killed
the
kind
and
the
character
of
wounds
often
tell
more
than
the
longest
accounts
sometimes
they
contradict
them
we
want
to
know
how
man
in
general
and
the
frenchman
in
particular
fought
yesterday
under
the
pressure
of
danger
impelled
by
the
instinct
for
did
he
follow
make
light
of
or
forget
the
methods
prescribed
or
recommended
did
he
fight
in
the
manner
imposed
upon
him
or
in
that
indicated
to
him
by
his
instinct
or
by
his
knowledge
of
warfare
when
we
have
the
answers
to
these
questions
we
shall
be
very
near
to
knowing
how
he
will
conduct
himself
with
and
against
appliances
far
more
destructive
than
those
of
yesterday
even
now
knowing
that
man
is
capable
only
of
a
given
quantity
of
terror
knowing
that
the
moral
effect
of
destruction
is
in
proportion
to
the
force
applied
we
are
able
to
predict
that
less
than
ever
will
studied
methods
be
practicable
such
methods
are
born
of
the
illusions
of
the
field
of
fire
and
are
opposed
to
the
teachings
of
our
own
experience
more
than
ever
will
the
individual
valor
of
the
soldier
and
of
small
groups
be
predominant
this
valor
is
secured
by
discipline
the
study
of
the
past
alone
can
give
us
a
true
perception
of
practical
methods
and
enable
us
to
see
how
the
soldier
will
inevitably
fight
so
instructed
so
informed
we
shall
not
be
confused
because
we
shall
be
able
to
prescribe
beforehand
such
methods
of
fighting
such
organization
such
dispositions
as
are
seen
to
be
inevitable
such
prescriptions
may
even
serve
to
regulate
the
inevitable
at
any
rate
they
will
serve
to
reduce
the
element
of
chance
by
enabling
the
commanding
officer
to
retain
control
as
long
as
possible
and
by
releasing
the
individual
only
at
the
moment
when
instinct
dominates
him
this
is
the
only
way
to
preserve
discipline
which
has
a
tendency
to
go
to
pieces
by
tactical
disobedience
at
the
moment
of
greatest
necessity
it
should
be
understood
that
the
prescriptions
in
question
have
to
do
with
dispositions
before
action
with
methods
of
fighting
and
not
with
maneuvers
maneuvers
are
the
movements
of
troops
in
the
theater
of
action
and
they
are
the
swift
and
ordered
movement
on
the
scene
of
action
of
tactical
units
of
all
sizes
they
do
not
constitute
action
action
follows
them
confusion
in
many
minds
between
maneuvers
and
action
brings
about
doubt
and
mistrust
of
our
regulation
drills
these
are
good
very
good
as
far
as
they
go
inasmuch
as
they
give
methods
of
executing
all
movements
of
taking
all
possible
formations
with
rapidity
and
good
order
to
change
them
to
discuss
them
does
not
advance
the
question
one
bit
they
do
not
affect
the
problem
of
positive
action
its
solution
lies
in
the
study
of
what
took
place
yesterday
from
which
alone
it
is
possible
to
deduce
what
will
happen
this
study
must
be
made
and
its
result
set
forth
each
leader
whose
worth
and
authority
has
been
tested
in
war
and
recognized
by
armies
has
done
something
of
the
sort
of
each
of
these
even
might
be
said
he
knew
the
soldier
he
knew
how
to
make
use
of
him
the
romans
too
had
this
knowledge
they
obtained
it
from
continuous
experience
and
profound
reflexion
thereon
experience
is
not
continuous
it
must
be
carefully
gathered
study
of
it
should
be
careful
and
the
results
should
stimulate
reflexion
especially
in
men
of
experience
extremes
meet
in
many
things
in
ancient
times
at
the
point
of
the
pike
and
sword
armies
have
conquered
similar
armies
twice
their
size
who
knows
if
in
these
days
of
perfected
arms
of
destruction
a
small
force
might
not
secure
by
a
happy
combination
of
good
sense
or
genius
with
morale
and
appliances
these
same
heroic
victories
over
a
greater
force
similarly
armed
in
spite
of
the
statements
of
napoleon
i
his
assumption
that
victory
is
always
on
the
side
of
the
strongest

chapter
i
general
discussion
ancient
and
modern
battle
i
have
heard
philosophers
reproached
for
studying
too
exclusively
man
in
general
and
neglecting
the
race
the
country
the
era
so
that
their
studies
of
him
offer
little
of
real
social
or
political
value
the
opposite
criticism
can
be
made
of
military
men
of
all
countries
they
are
always
eager
to
expound
traditional
tactics
and
organization
suitable
to
the
particular
character
of
their
race
always
the
bravest
of
all
races
they
fail
to
consider
as
a
factor
in
the
problem
man
confronted
by
danger
facts
are
incredibly
different
from
all
theories
perhaps
in
this
time
of
military
reorganization
it
would
not
be
out
of
place
to
make
a
study
of
man
in
battle
and
of
battle
itself
the
art
of
war
is
subjected
to
many
modifications
by
industrial
and
scientific
progress
but
one
thing
does
not
change
the
heart
of
man
in
the
last
analysis
success
in
battle
is
a
matter
of
morale
in
all
matters
which
pertain
to
an
army
organization
discipline
and
tactics
the
human
heart
in
the
supreme
moment
of
battle
is
the
basic
factor
it
is
rarely
taken
into
account
and
often
strange
errors
are
the
result
witness
the
carbine
an
accurate
and
long
range
weapon
which
has
never
given
the
service
expected
of
it
because
it
was
used
mechanically
without
considering
the
human
heart
we
must
consider
it
with
improvement
in
weapons
the
power
of
destruction
increases
the
moral
effect
of
such
weapons
increases
and
courage
to
face
them
becomes
rarer
man
does
not
can
not
change
what
should
increase
with
the
power
of
material
is
the
strength
of
organization
the
unity
of
the
fighting
machine
yet
these
are
most
neglected
a
million
men
at
maneuvers
are
useless
if
a
sane
and
reasoned
organization
does
not
assure
their
discipline
and
thereby
their
reliability
that
is
their
courage
in
action
four
brave
men
who
do
not
know
each
other
will
not
dare
to
attack
a
lion
four
less
brave
but
knowing
each
other
well
sure
of
their
reliability
and
consequently
of
mutual
aid
will
attack
resolutely
there
is
the
science
of
the
organization
of
armies
in
a
nutshell
at
any
time
a
new
invention
may
assure
victory
granted
but
practicable
weapons
are
not
invented
every
day
and
nations
quickly
put
themselves
on
the
same
footing
as
regards
armament
the
determining
factor
leaving
aside
generals
of
genius
and
luck
is
the
quality
of
troops
that
is
the
organization
that
best
assures
their
esprit
their
reliability
their
confidence
their
unity
troops
in
this
sense
means
soldiers
soldiers
no
matter
how
well
drilled
who
are
assembled
haphazard
into
companies
and
battalions
will
never
have
have
never
had
that
entire
unity
which
is
born
of
mutual
acquaintanceship
in
studying
ancient
battle
we
have
seen
what
a
terrible
thing
battle
is
we
have
seen
that
man
will
not
really
fight
except
under
disciplinary
pressure
even
before
having
studied
modern
battle
we
know
that
the
only
real
armies
are
those
to
which
a
well
thought
out
and
rational
organization
gives
unity
throughout
battle
the
destructive
power
of
improved
firearms
becomes
greater
battle
becomes
more
open
hindering
supervision
passing
beyond
the
vision
of
the
commander
and
even
of
subordinate
officers
in
the
same
degree
unity
should
be
strengthened
the
organization
which
assures
unity
of
the
combatants
should
be
better
thought
out
and
more
rational
the
power
of
arms
increases
man
and
his
weaknesses
remain
the
same
what
good
is
an
army
of
two
hundred
thousand
men
of
whom
only
really
fight
while
the
other
one
hundred
thousand
disappear
in
a
hundred
ways
better
to
have
one
hundred
thousand
who
can
be
counted
upon
the
purpose
of
discipline
is
to
make
men
fight
in
spite
of
themselves
no
army
is
worthy
of
the
name
without
discipline
there
is
no
army
at
all
without
organization
and
all
organization
is
defective
which
neglects
any
means
to
strengthen
the
unity
of
combatants
methods
can
not
be
identical
draconian
discipline
does
not
fit
our
customs
discipline
must
be
a
state
of
mind
a
social
institution
based
on
the
salient
virtues
and
defects
of
the
nation
discipline
can
not
be
secured
or
created
in
a
day
it
is
an
institution
a
tradition
the
commander
must
have
confidence
in
his
right
to
command
he
must
be
accustomed
to
command
and
proud
to
command
this
is
what
strengthens
discipline
in
armies
commanded
by
an
aristocracy
in
certain
countries
the
prussians
do
not
neglect
the
homogeneity
and
consequent
unity
of
organization
they
recognize
its
value

prussians
the

all
hessians
with
their

the
americans
have
shown
us
what
happens
in
modern
battle
to
large
armies
without
cohesion
with
them
the
lack
of
discipline
and
organization
has
had
the
inevitable
result
battle
has
been
between
hidden
skirmishers
at
long
distance
and
has
lasted
for
days
until
some
faulty
movement
perhaps
a
moral
exhaustion
has
caused
one
or
the
other
of
the
opposing
forces
to
give
way
in
this
american
war
the
mêlées
of
agincourt
are
said
to
have
reappeared
which
merely
means
a
mêlée
of
fugitives
but
less
than
ever
has
there
been
close
combat
to
fight
from
a
distance
is
instinctive
in
man
from
the
first
day
he
has
worked
to
this
end
and
he
continues
to
do
so
it
was
thought
that
with
long
range
weapons
close
combat
might
return
on
the
contrary
troops
keep
further
off
before
its
effects
the
primitive
man
the
arab
is
instability
incarnate
a
breath
a
nothing
governs
him
at
each
instant
in
war
the
civilized
man
in
war
which
is
opposed
to
civilization
returns
naturally
to
his
first
instincts
with
the
arab
war
remains
a
matter
of
agility
and
cunning
hunting
is
his
principal
pastime
and
the
pursuit
of
wild
beasts
teaches
the
pursuit
of
man
general
daumas
depicts
arabs
as
cavaliers
what
more
chivalrous
warfare
than
the
night
surprise
and
sack
of
a
camp
empty
words
it
is
commonly
said
that
modern
war
is
the
most
recondite
of
things
requiring
experts
war
so
long
as
man
risks
his
skin
in
it
will
always
be
a
matter
of
instinct
ancient
battle
resembled
drill
there
is
no
such
resemblance
in
modern
battle
this
greatly
disconcerts
both
officers
and
soldiers
ancient
battles
were
picnics
for
the
victors
who
lost
nobody
not
so
artillery
played
no
part
in
ancient
battle
the
invention
of
firearms
has
diminished
losses
in
battle
the
improvement
of
firearms
continues
to
diminish
losses
this
looks
like
a
paradox
but
statistics
prove
it
nor
is
it
unreasonable
does
war
become
deadlier
with
the
improvement
of
weapons
not
at
all
man
is
capable
of
standing
before
a
certain
amount
of
terror
beyond
that
he
flees
from
battle
the
battle
of
pharsalus
lasted
some
four
hours
caesar
broke
his
camp
which
is
done
in
the
morning
then
the
formation
for
battle
then
the
battle
etc
and
he
says
that
his
troops
were
tired
the
battle
having
lasted
up
to
noon
this
indicates
that
he
considered
it
long
for
the
middle
ages
consult
froissart
the
knights
in
the
battle
of
the
thirty
were
armed
for
battle
on
foot
which
they
preferred
in
a
serious
affair
that
is
to
say
in
a
restricted
space
there
was
a
halt
a
rest
in
the
combat
when
the
two
parties
became
exhausted
the
bretons
at
this
rest
were
against
thirty
the
battle
had
lasted
up
to
exhaustion
without
loss
by
the
english
without
montauban
the
battle
would
have
been
terminated
by
complete
and
mutual
exhaustion
and
without
further
losses
for
the
greater
the
fatigue
the
less
strength
remained
for
piercing
the
armor
montauban
was
at
the
same
time
felon
and
hero
felon
because
he
did
a
thing
not
permitted
by
the
code
of
combat
hero
because
if
the
bretons
had
not
ably
profited
by
the
disorder
he
would
have
been
killed
when
he
entered
the
english
formation
alone
at
the
end
of
the
contest
the
bretons
had
four
killed
the
english
eight
four
of
the
killed
were
overcome
by
their
armor
explain
how
under
turenne
men
held
much
longer
under
fire
than
it
is
perfectly
simple
man
is
capable
of
standing
before
only
a
certain
amount
of
terror
there
must
be
swallowed
in
five
minutes
what
took
an
hour
under
turenne
an
example
will
be
given
with
the
present
arms
whose
usage
is
generally
known
the
instruction
of
the
soldier
is
of
little
importance
it
does
not
make
the
soldier
take
as
an
example
the
case
of
the
peasants
of
the
vendée
their
unity
and
not
individual
instruction
made
them
soldiers
whose
value
could
not
be
denied
such
unity
was
natural
in
people
of
the
same
village
of
the
same
commune
led
in
battle
by
their
own
lords
their
own
priests
etc
the
greater
the
perfection
of
weapons
the
more
dreadful
becomes
modern
battle
and
discipline
becomes
more
difficult
to
maintain
the
less
mobile
the
troops
the
deadlier
are
battles
bayonet
attacks
are
not
so
easily
made
and
morale
consequently
is
less
affected
man
fearing
man
more
than
death
astonishing
losses
seem
to
have
been
suffered
without
breaking
by
turenne
armies
were
the
casualty
reports
submitted
by
the
captains
of
those
days
correct
frederick
liked
to
say
that
three
men
behind
the
enemy
were
worth
more
than
fifty
in
front
of
him
for
moral
effect
the
field
of
action
is
more
extensive
than
in
frederick
time
battle
is
delivered
on
more
accidented
terrain
as
armies
with
great
mobility
do
not
need
any
particular
terrain
to
fight
on
the
nature
of
ancient
arms
required
close
order
modern
arms
require
open
order
and
they
are
at
the
same
time
of
such
terrible
power
that
against
them
too
often
discipline
is
broken
what
is
the
solution
have
your
combatants
opened
out
have
them
well
acquainted
with
each
other
so
as
to
have
unity
have
reserves
to
threaten
with
held
with
an
iron
hand
modern
weapons
have
a
terrible
effect
and
are
almost
unbearable
by
the
nervous
system
who
can
say
that
he
has
not
been
frightened
in
battle
discipline
in
battle
becomes
the
more
necessary
as
the
ranks
become
more
open
and
the
material
cohesion
of
the
ranks
not
giving
confidence
it
must
spring
from
a
knowledge
of
comrades
and
a
trust
in
officers
who
must
always
be
present
and
seen
what
man
advances
with
the
confidence
that
rigid
discipline
and
pride
in
himself
gave
the
roman
soldier
even
though
the
contest
is
no
longer
with
man
but
with
fate
the
artillery
is
effective
at
great
distances
there
is
much
liberty
of
movement
for
the
different
arms
the
apparent
liaison
between
arms
is
lessened
this
has
its
influence
on
morale
there
is
another
advantage
in
reliable
troops
in
that
they
can
be
extended
more
widely
and
will
consequently
suffer
smaller
losses
and
be
in
better
morale
for
close
conflict
the
further
off
one
is
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
judge
of
the
terrain
consequently
the
greater
is
the
necessity
for
scouting
for
reconnoitering
the
terrain
by
skirmishers
this
is
something
that
the
duke
of
gramont
forgot
at
nordlingen
and
which
is
often
forgotten
but
it
constitutes
another
important
reason
for
the
use
of
skirmishers
the
formation
in
rank
is
a
disciplinary
measure
against
the
weakness
of
man
in
the
face
of
danger
this
weakness
is
greater
in
that
the
moral
action
of
weapons
is
more
powerful
and
that
the
material
rank
has
the
inherent
lack
of
cohesion
of
open
order
however
open
order
is
necessary
to
economize
losses
and
permit
the
use
of
weapons
thus
there
is
greater
necessity
than
ever
for
the
rank
that
is
for
discipline
not
for
the
geometrical
rank
it
is
at
the
same
time
more
necessary
and
doubly
difficult
to
attain
in
ancient
battle
unity
existed
at
least
with
the
greeks
and
the
romans
the
soldier
was
known
to
his
officer
and
comrades
they
saw
that
he
fought
in
modern
armies
where
losses
are
as
great
for
the
victor
as
for
the
vanquished
the
soldier
must
more
often
be
replaced
in
ancient
battle
the
victor
had
no
losses
the
soldier
is
often
unknown
to
his
comrades
he
is
lost
in
the
smoke
the
dispersion
the
confusion
of
battle
he
seems
to
fight
alone
unity
is
no
longer
insured
by
mutual
surveillance
a
man
falls
and
disappears
who
knows
whether
it
was
a
bullet
or
the
fear
of
advancing
further
that
struck
him
the
ancient
combatant
was
never
struck
by
an
invisible
weapon
and
could
not
fall
in
this
way
the
more
difficult
surveillance
the
more
necessary
becomes
the
individuality
of
companies
sections
squads
not
the
least
of
their
boasts
should
be
their
ability
to
stand
a
roll
call
at
all
times
the
ancients
often
avoided
hand
to
hand
conflict
so
terrible
were
its
consequences
in
modern
combat
there
never
is
hand
to
hand
conflict
if
one
stands
fast
from
day
to
day
close
combat
tends
to
disappear
it
is
replaced
by
fire
action
above
all
by
the
moral
action
of
maneuvers
dispersion
brings
us
back
to
the
necessity
for
the
unity
which
was
an
absolute
necessity
in
ancient
battle
strategy
is
a
game
the
first
strategist
long
before
napoleon
was
horace
with
his
three
enemies
the
size
of
the
battle
field
permits
less
than
ever
holding
units
together
the
rôle
of
the
general
is
much
more
difficult
many
more
chances
are
left
to
fate
thus
the
greater
the
necessity
for
the
best
troops
who
know
best
their
trade
who
are
most
dependable
and
of
greatest
fortitude
to
diminish
the
effect
of
luck
it
is
necessary
to
hold
longer
to
wait
for
help
from
a
distance
battles
resolve
themselves
into
battles
of
soldiers
the
final
decision
is
more
difficult
to
obtain
there
is
a
strange
similarity
in
battle
at
one
league
to
battle
at
two
paces
the
value
of
the
soldier
is
the
essential
element
of
success
let
us
strengthen
the
soldier
by
unity
battle
has
more
importance
than
ever
communication
facilities
such
as
the
telegraph
concentration
facilities
such
as
the
railroad
render
more
difficult
such
strategic
surprises
as
ulm
and
jena
the
whole
forces
of
a
country
can
thus
be
united
so
united
defeat
becomes
irreparable
disorganization
greater
and
more
rapid
in
modern
combat
the
mêlée
really
exists
more
than
in
ancient
battle
this
appears
paradoxical
it
is
true
nevertheless
of
the
mêlée
taken
in
the
sense
of
a
mixed
up
affair
where
it
is
infinitely
difficult
to
see
clearly
man
in
the
combat
of
our
days
is
a
man
who
hardly
knowing
how
to
swim
is
suddenly
thrown
into
the
sea
the
good
quality
of
troops
will
more
than
ever
secure
victory
as
to
the
comparative
value
of
troops
with
cohesion
and
of
new
troops
look
at
the
zouaves
of
the
guard
or
the
grenadiers
at
magenta
and
the
at
solferino
nothing
should
be
neglected
to
make
the
battle
order
stronger
man
stronger
moral
elements
in
battle
when
in
complete
security
after
dinner
in
full
physical
and
moral
contentment
men
consider
war
and
battle
they
are
animated
by
a
noble
ardor
that
has
nothing
in
common
with
reality
how
many
of
them
however
even
at
that
moment
would
be
ready
to
risk
their
lives
but
oblige
them
to
march
for
days
and
weeks
to
arrive
at
the
battle
ground
and
on
the
day
of
battle
oblige
them
to
wait
minutes
hours
to
deliver
it
if
they
were
honest
they
would
testify
how
much
the
physical
fatigue
and
the
mental
anguish
that
precede
action
have
lowered
their
morale
how
much
less
eager
to
fight
they
are
than
a
month
before
when
they
arose
from
the
table
in
a
generous
mood
man
heart
is
as
changeable
as
fortune
man
shrinks
back
apprehends
danger
in
any
effort
in
which
he
does
not
foresee
success
there
are
some
isolated
characters
of
an
iron
temper
who
resist
the
tendency
but
they
are
carried
away
by
the
great
majority
bismarck
examples
show
that
if
a
withdrawal
is
forced
the
army
is
discouraged
and
takes
flight
frederick
the
brave
heart
does
not
change
real
bravery
inspired
by
devotion
to
duty
does
not
know
panic
and
is
always
the
same
the
bravery
sprung
from
hot
blood
pleases
the
frenchman
more
he
understands
it
it
appeals
to
his
vanity
it
is
a
characteristic
of
his
nature
but
it
is
passing
it
fails
him
at
times
especially
when
there
is
nothing
for
him
to
gain
in
doing
his
duty
the
turks
are
full
of
ardor
in
the
advance
they
carry
their
officers
with
them
but
they
retreat
with
the
same
facility
abandoning
their
officers
mediocre
troops
like
to
be
led
by
their
shepherds
reliable
troops
like
to
be
directed
with
their
directors
alongside
of
them
or
behind
with
the
former
the
general
must
be
the
leader
on
horseback
with
the
latter
the
manager
warnery
did
not
like
officers
to
head
a
charge
he
thought
it
useless
to
have
them
killed
before
the
others
he
did
not
place
them
in
front
and
his
cavalry
was
good
general
leboeuf
did
not
favor
the
proposed
advance
into
battle
with
platoon
leaders
in
front
of
the
center
of
their
platoons
the
fear
exists
that
the
fall
of
the
captain
will
demoralize
the
rest
what
is
the
solution
leboeuf
must
have
known
that
if
the
officer
is
not
in
front
of
his
command
it
will
advance
less
confidently
that
with
us
all
officers
are
almost
always
in
advance
practice
is
stronger
than
any
theory
therefore
fit
theories
to
it
in
column
put
the
chiefs
of
platoon
on
the
flank
where
they
can
see
clearly
frightfulness
witness
the
turks
in
the
polish
wars
what
gave
power
to
the
turks
in
their
wars
with
poland
was
not
so
much
their
real
strength
as
their
ferocity
they
massacred
all
who
resisted
they
massacred
without
the
excuse
of
resistance
terror
preceded
them
breaking
down
the
courage
of
their
enemies
the
necessity
to
win
or
to
submit
to
extreme
peril
brought
about
cowardice
and
submission
for
fear
of
being
conquered
turenne
said
you
tremble
body
the
instinct
of
can
then
make
the
strongest
tremble
but
they
are
strong
enough
to
overcome
their
emotion
the
fear
of
advancing
without
even
losing
their
heads
or
their
coolness
fear
with
them
never
becomes
terror
it
is
forgotten
in
the
activities
of
command
he
who
does
not
feel
strong
enough
to
keep
his
heart
from
ever
being
gripped
by
terror
should
never
think
of
becoming
an
officer
the
soldiers
themselves
have
emotion
the
sense
of
duty
discipline
pride
the
example
of
their
officers
and
above
all
their
coolness
sustain
them
and
prevent
their
fear
from
becoming
terror
their
emotion
never
allows
them
to
sight
or
to
more
than
approximately
adjust
their
fire
often
they
fire
into
the
air
cromwell
knew
this
very
well
dependable
as
his
troops
were
when
he
said
put
your
trust
in
god
and
aim
at
their
shoe
laces
what
is
too
true
is
that
bravery
often
does
not
at
all
exclude
cowardice
horrible
devices
to
secure
personal
safety
infamous
conduct
the
romans
were
not
mighty
men
but
men
of
discipline
and
obstinacy
we
have
no
idea
of
the
roman
military
mind
so
entirely
different
from
ours
a
roman
general
who
had
as
little
coolness
as
we
have
would
have
been
lost
we
have
incentives
in
decorations
and
medals
that
would
have
made
a
roman
soldier
run
the
gauntlet
how
many
men
before
a
lion
have
the
courage
to
look
him
in
the
face
to
think
of
and
put
into
practice
measures
of
in
war
when
terror
has
seized
you
as
experience
has
shown
it
often
does
you
are
as
before
a
lion
you
fly
trembling
and
let
yourself
be
eaten
up
are
there
so
few
really
brave
men
among
so
many
soldiers
alas
yes
gideon
was
lucky
to
find
three
hundred
in
thirty
thousand
napoleon
said
two
mamelukes
held
three
frenchmen
but
one
hundred
french
cavalry
did
not
fear
the
same
number
of
mamelukes
three
hundred
vanquished
the
same
number
one
thousand
french
beat
fifteen
hundred
mamelukes
such
was
the
influence
of
tactics
order
and
maneuver
in
ordinary
language
such
was
the
great
moral
influence
of
unity
established
by
discipline
and
made
possible
and
effective
in
battle
by
organization
and
mutual
support
with
unity
and
sensible
formation
men
of
an
individual
value
less
beat
those
who
were
individually
their
betters
that
is
the
essential
must
be
the
essential
point
in
the
organization
of
an
army
on
reflection
this
simple
statement
of
napoleon
seems
to
contain
the
whole
of
battle
morale
make
the

believe
that

is
lacking

in
like
manner
his
squadrons
battalions
brigades
and
divisions
and
victory
is
yours
if
on
account
of
bad
organization
he
does
not
anticipate
mutual
support
there
is
no
need
of
such
maneuver
the
attack
is
enough
some
men
such
as
orientals
chinese
tartars
mongols
do
not
fear
death
they
are
resigned
to
it
at
all
times
why
is
it
that
they
can
not
stand
before
the
armies
of
the
western
people
it
is
lack
of
organization
the
instinct
of
which
at
the
last
moment
dominates
them
utterly
is
not
opposed
by
discipline
we
have
often
seen
fanatic
eastern
peoples
implicitly
believing
that
death
in
battle
means
a
happy
and
glorious
resurrection
superior
in
numbers
give
way
before
discipline
if
attacked
confidently
they
are
crushed
by
their
own
weight
in
close
combat
the
dagger
is
better
than
the
bayonet
but
instinct
is
too
strong
for
such
people
what
makes
the
soldier
capable
of
obedience
and
direction
in
action
is
the
sense
of
discipline
this
includes
respect
for
and
confidence
in
his
chiefs
confidence
in
his
comrades
and
fear
of
their
reproaches
and
retaliation
if
he
abandons
them
in
danger
his
desire
to
go
where
others
do
without
trembling
more
than
they
in
a
word
the
whole
of
esprit
de
corps
organization
only
can
produce
these
characteristics
four
men
equal
a
lion
note
the
army
organizations
and
tactical
formations
on
paper
are
always
determined
from
the
mechanical
point
of
view
neglecting
the
essential
coefficient
that
of
morale
they
are
almost
always
wrong
esprit
de
corps
is
secured
in
war
but
war
becomes
shorter
and
shorter
and
more
and
more
violent
consequently
secure
esprit
de
corps
in
advance
mental
acquaintanceship
is
not
enough
to
make
a
good
organization
a
good
general
esprit
is
needed
all
must
work
for
battle
and
not
merely
live
quietly
going
through
with
drills
without
understanding
their
application
once
a
man
knows
how
to
use
his
weapon
and
obey
all
commands
there
is
needed
only
occasional
drill
to
brush
up
those
who
have
forgotten
marches
and
battle
maneuvers
are
what
is
needed
the
technical
training
of
the
soldier
is
not
the
most
difficult
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
know
how
to
use
and
take
care
of
his
weapon
to
know
how
to
move
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
forward
to
the
rear
at
command
to
charge
and
to
march
with
full
pack
but
this
does
not
make
the
soldier
the
vendeans
who
knew
little
of
this
were
tough
soldiers
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
change
the
instruction
to
reduce
it
to
the
necessary
minimum
and
to
cut
out
all
the
superfluities
with
which
peacetime
laborers
overload
it
each
year
to
know
the
essential
well
is
better
than
having
some
knowledge
of
a
lot
of
things
many
of
them
useless
teach
this
the
first
year
that
the
second
but
the
essential
from
the
beginning
also
instruction
should
be
simple
to
avoid
the
mental
fatigue
of
long
drills
that
disgust
everybody
here
is
a
significant
sentence
in
colonel
borbstaed
enumeration
of
the
reasons
for
prussian
victory
over
the
austrians
in
it
was
because
each
man
being
trained
knew
how
to
act
promptly
and
confidently
in
all
phases
of
battle
this
is
a
fact
to
be
held
in
a
building
at
every
minute
of
the
day
to
have
every
movement
every
attitude
under
a
not
too
intelligent
surveillance
is
indeed
to
be
harried
this
incessant
surveillance
weakens
the
morale
of
both
the
watched
and
the
watcher
what
is
the
reason
for
this
incessant
surveillance
which
has
long
since
exceeded
shipboard
surveillance
was
not
that
strict
enough
material
and
moral
effect
the
effect
of
an
army
of
one
organization
on
another
is
at
the
same
time
material
and
moral
the
material
effect
of
an
organization
is
in
its
power
to
destroy
the
moral
effect
in
the
fear
that
it
inspires
in
battle
two
moral
forces
even
more
than
two
material
forces
are
in
conflict
the
stronger
conquers
the
victor
has
often
lost
by
fire
more
than
the
vanquished
moral
effect
does
not
come
entirely
from
destructive
power
real
and
effective
as
it
may
be
it
comes
above
all
from
its
presumed
threatening
power
present
in
the
form
of
reserves
threatening
to
renew
the
battle
of
troops
that
appear
on
the
flank
even
of
a
determined
frontal
attack
material
effect
is
greater
as
instruments
are
better
weapons
mounts
etc
as
the
men
know
better
how
to
use
them
and
as
the
men
are
more
numerous
and
stronger
so
that
in
case
of
success
they
can
carry
on
longer
with
equal
or
even
inferior
power
of
destruction
he
will
win
who
has
the
resolution
to
advance
who
by
his
formations
and
maneuvers
can
continually
threaten
his
adversary
with
a
new
phase
of
material
action
who
in
a
word
has
the
moral
ascendancy
moral
effect
inspires
fear
fear
must
be
changed
to
terror
in
order
to
vanquish
when
confidence
is
placed
in
superiority
of
material
means
valuable
as
they
are
against
an
enemy
at
a
distance
it
may
be
betrayed
by
the
actions
of
the
enemy
if
he
closes
with
you
in
spite
of
your
superiority
in
means
of
destruction
the
morale
of
the
enemy
mounts
with
the
loss
of
your
confidence
his
morale
dominates
yours
you
flee
entrenched
troops
give
way
in
this
manner
at
pharsalus
pompey
and
his
army
counted
on
a
cavalry
corps
turning
and
taking
caesar
in
the
rear
in
addition
pompey
army
was
twice
as
numerous
caesar
parried
the
blow
and
his
enemy
who
saw
the
failure
of
the
means
of
action
he
counted
on
was
demoralized
beaten
lost
fifteen
thousand
men
put
to
the
sword
while
caesar
lost
only
two
hundred
and
as
many
prisoners
even
by
advancing
you
affect
the
morale
of
the
enemy
but
your
object
is
to
dominate
him
and
make
him
retreat
before
your
ascendancy
and
it
is
certain
that
everything
that
diminishes
the
enemy
morale
adds
to
your
resolution
in
advancing
adopt
then
a
formation
which
permits
your
destructive
agency
your
skirmishers
to
help
you
throughout
by
their
material
action
and
to
this
degree
diminish
that
of
the
enemy
armor
in
diminishing
the
material
effect
that
can
be
suffered
diminishes
the
dominating
moral
effect
of
fear
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
much
armor
adds
to
the
moral
effect
of
cavalry
action
at
the
critical
moment
you
feel
that
thanks
to
his
armor
the
enemy
will
succeed
in
getting
to
you
it
is
to
be
noted
that
when
a
body
actually
awaits
the
attack
of
another
up
to
bayonet
distance
something
extraordinarily
rare
and
the
attacking
troop
does
not
falter
the
first
does
not
defend
itself
this
is
the
massacre
of
ancient
battle
against
unimaginative
men
who
retain
some
coolness
and
consequently
the
faculty
of
reasoning
in
danger
moral
effect
will
be
as
material
effect
the
mere
act
of
attack
does
not
completely
succeed
against
such
troops
witness
battles
in
spain
and
waterloo
it
is
necessary
to
destroy
them
and
we
are
better
at
this
than
they
by
our
aptitude
in
the
use
of
skirmishers
and
above
all
in
the
mad
dash
of
our
cavalry
but
the
cavalry
must
not
be
treated
until
it
comes
to
so
consider
itself
as
a
precious
jewel
which
must
be
guarded
against
injury
there
should
be
little
of
it
but
it
must
be
good
seek
and
ye
shall
find
not
the
ideal
but
the
best
method
that
exists
in
maneuvers
skirmishers
who
have
some
effect
are
returned
to
ranks
to
execute
fire
in
two
ranks
which
never
killed
anybody
why
not
put
your
skirmishers
in
advance
why
sound
trumpet
calls
which
they
neither
hear
nor
understand
that
they
do
not
is
fortunate
for
each
captain
has
a
different
call
sounded
example
at
alma
the
retreat
etc
the
great
superiority
of
roman
tactics
lay
in
their
constant
endeavor
to
coördinate
physical
and
moral
effect
moral
effect
passes
finally
one
sees
that
the
enemy
is
not
so
terrible
as
he
appeared
to
be
physical
effect
does
not
the
greeks
tried
to
dominate
the
romans
preferred
to
kill
and
kill
they
did
they
followed
thereby
the
better
method
their
moral
effect
was
aided
by
their
reliable
and
deadly
swords
what
moral
force
is
worth
to
a
nation
at
war
is
shown
by
examples
pichegru
played
the
traitor
this
had
great
influence
at
home
and
we
were
beaten
napoleon
came
back
victory
returned
with
him
but
at
that
we
can
do
nothing
without
good
troops
not
even
with
a
napoleon
witness
turenne
army
after
his
death
it
remained
excellent
in
spite
of
conflict
between
and
the
inefficiency
of
its
two
leaders
note
the
defensive
retreat
across
the
rhine
the
regiment
in
champagne
attacked
in
front
by
infantry
and
taken
in
the
rear
by
cavalry
one
of
the
prettiest
feats
of
the
art
of
war
in
modern
battle
which
is
delivered
with
combatants
so
far
apart
man
has
come
to
have
a
horror
of
man
he
comes
to
hand
to
hand
fighting
only
to
defend
his
body
or
if
forced
to
it
by
some
fortuitous
encounter
more
than
that
it
may
be
said
that
he
seeks
to
catch
the
fugitive
only
for
fear
that
he
will
turn
and
fight
guilbert
says
that
shock
actions
are
infinitely
rare
here
infinity
is
taken
in
its
exact
mathematical
sense
guilbert
reduces
to
nothing
by
deductions
from
practical
examples
the
mathematical
theory
of
the
shock
of
one
massed
body
on
another
indeed
the
physical
impulse
is
nothing
the
moral
impulse
which
estimates
the
attacker
is
everything
the
moral
impulse
lies
in
the
perception
by
the
enemy
of
the
resolution
that
animates
you
they
say
that
the
battle
of
amstetten
was
the
only
one
in
which
a
line
actually
waited
for
the
shock
of
another
line
charging
with
the
bayonets
even
then
the
russians
gave
way
before
the
moral
and
not
before
the
physical
impulse
they
were
already
disconcerted
wavering
worried
hesitant
vacillating
when
the
blow
fell
they
waited
long
enough
to
receive
bayonet
thrusts
even
blows
with
the
rifle
in
the
back
as
at
inkermann
this
done
they
fled
he
who
calm
and
strong
of
heart
awaits
his
enemy
has
all
the
advantage
of
fire
but
the
moral
impulse
of
the
assailant
demoralizes
the
assailed
he
is
frightened
he
sets
his
sight
no
longer
he
does
not
even
aim
his
piece
his
lines
are
broken
without
defense
unless
indeed
his
cavalry
waiting
halted
horsemen
a
meter
apart
and
in
two
ranks
does
not
break
first
and
destroy
all
formation
with
good
troops
on
both
sides
if
an
attack
is
not
prepared
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
will
fail
the
attacking
troops
suffer
more
materially
than
the
defenders
the
latter
are
in
better
order
fresh
while
the
assailants
are
in
disorder
and
already
have
suffered
a
loss
of
morale
under
a
certain
amount
of
punishment
the
moral
superiority
given
by
the
offensive
movement
may
be
more
than
compensated
by
the
good
order
and
integrity
of
the
defenders
when
the
assailants
have
suffered
losses
the
slightest
reaction
by
the
defense
may
demoralize
the
attack
this
is
the
secret
of
the
success
of
the
british
infantry
in
spain
and
not
their
fire
by
rank
which
was
as
ineffective
with
them
as
with
us
the
more
confidence
one
has
in
his
methods
of
attack
or
defense
the
more
disconcerted
he
is
to
see
them
at
some
time
incapable
of
stopping
the
enemy
the
effect
of
the
present
improved
fire
arm
is
still
limited
with
the
present
organization
and
use
of
riflemen
to
point
blank
ranges
it
follows
that
bayonet
charges
where
bayonet
thrusts
never
occur
otherwise
attacks
under
fire
will
have
an
increasing
value
and
that
victory
will
be
his
who
secures
most
order
and
determined
dash
with
these
two
qualities
too
much
neglected
with
us
with
willingness
with
intelligence
enough
to
keep
a
firm
hold
on
troops
in
immediate
support
we
may
hope
to
take
and
to
hold
what
we
take
do
not
then
neglect
destructive
effort
before
using
moral
effect
use
skirmishers
up
to
the
last
moment
otherwise
no
attack
can
succeed
it
is
true
it
is
haphazard
fire
nevertheless
it
is
effective
because
of
its
volume
this
moral
effect
must
be
a
terrible
thing
a
body
advances
to
meet
another
the
defender
has
only
to
remain
calm
ready
to
aim
each
man
pitted
against
a
man
before
him
the
attacking
body
comes
within
deadly
range
whether
or
not
it
halts
to
fire
it
will
be
a
target
for
the
other
body
which
awaits
it
calm
ready
sure
of
its
effect
the
whole
first
rank
of
the
assailant
falls
smashed
the
remainder
little
encouraged
by
their
reception
disperse
automatically
or
before
the
least
indication
of
an
advance
on
them
is
this
what
happens
not
at
all
the
moral
effect
of
the
assault
worries
the
defenders
they
fire
in
the
air
if
at
all
they
disperse
immediately
before
the
assailants
who
are
even
encouraged
by
this
fire
now
that
it
is
over
it
quickens
them
in
order
to
avoid
a
second
salvo
it
is
said
by
those
who
fought
them
in
spain
and
at
waterloo
that
the
british
are
capable
of
the
necessary
coolness
i
doubt
it
nevertheless
after
firing
they
made
swift
attacks
if
they
had
not
they
might
have
fled
anyhow
the
english
are
stolid
folks
with
little
imagination
who
try
to
be
logical
in
all
things
the
french
with
their
nervous
irritability
their
lively
imagination
are
incapable
of
such
a
defense
anybody
who
thinks
that
he
could
stand
under
a
second
fire
is
a
man
without
any
idea
of
battle
prince
de
ligne
modern
history
furnishes
us
with
no
examples
of
stonewall
troops
who
can
neither
be
shaken
nor
driven
back
who
stand
patiently
the
heaviest
fire
yet
who
retire
precipitately
when
the
general
orders
the
retreat
bismarck
cavalry
maneuvers
like
those
of
infantry
are
threats
the
most
threatening
win
the
formation
in
ranks
is
a
threat
and
more
than
a
threat
a
force
engaged
is
out
of
the
hand
of
its
commander
i
know
i
see
what
it
does
what
it
is
capable
of
it
acts
i
can
estimate
the
effect
of
its
action
but
a
force
in
formation
is
in
hand
i
know
it
is
there
i
see
it
feel
it
it
may
be
used
in
any
direction
i
feel
instinctively
that
it
alone
can
surely
reach
me
take
me
on
the
right
on
the
left
throw
itself
into
a
gap
turn
me
it
troubles
me
threatens
me
where
is
the
threatened
blow
going
to
fall
the
formation
in
ranks
is
a
serious
threat
which
may
at
any
moment
be
put
into
effect
it
awes
one
in
a
terrible
fashion
in
the
heat
of
battle
formed
troops
do
more
to
secure
victory
than
do
those
actively
engaged
this
is
true
whether
such
a
body
actually
exists
or
whether
it
exists
only
in
the
imagination
of
the
enemy
in
an
indecisive
battle
he
wins
who
can
show
and
merely
show
battalions
and
squadrons
in
hand
they
inspire
the
fear
of
the
unknown
from
the
taking
of
the
entrenchments
at
fribourg
up
to
the
engagement
at
the
bridge
of
arcola
up
to
solferino
there
occur
a
multitude
of
deeds
of
valor
of
positions
taken
by
frontal
attack
which
deceive
every
one
generals
as
well
as
civilians
and
which
always
cause
the
same
mistakes
to
be
made
it
is
time
to
teach
these
folks
that
the
entrenchments
at
fribourg
were
not
won
by
frontal
attack
nor
was
the
bridge
of
arcola
see
the
correspondence
of
napoleon
i
nor
was
solferino
lieutenant
hercule
took
fifty
cavalry
through
alpon
ten
kilometers
on
the
flank
of
the
austrians
at
arcola
and
the
position
that
held
us
up
for
three
days
was
evacuated
the
evacuation
was
the
result
of
strategic
if
not
of
tactical
moral
effect
general
or
soldier
man
is
the
same
demonstrations
should
be
made
at
greater
or
less
distance
according
to
the
morale
of
the
enemy
that
is
to
say
battle
methods
vary
with
the
enemy
and
an
appropriate
method
should
be
employed
in
each
individual
case
we
have
treated
and
shall
treat
only
of
the
infantryman
in
ancient
as
in
modern
battle
he
is
the
one
who
suffers
most
in
ancient
battle
if
he
is
defeated
he
remains
because
of
his
slowness
at
the
mercy
of
the
victor
in
modern
battle
the
mounted
man
moves
swiftly
through
danger
the
infantryman
has
to
walk
he
even
has
to
halt
in
danger
often
and
for
long
periods
of
time
he
who
knows
the
morale
of
the
infantryman
which
is
put
to
the
hardest
proof
knows
the
morale
of
all
the
combatants
the
theory
of
strong
battalions
numbers
are
considered
the
essential
napoleon
had
this
tendency
note
his
strength
reports
the
romans
did
not
pay
so
much
attention
to
it
what
they
paid
most
attention
to
was
to
seeing
that
everybody
fought
we
assume
that
all
the
personnel
present
with
an
army
with
a
division
with
a
regiment
on
the
day
of
battle
fights
right
there
is
the
error
the
theory
of
strong
battalions
is
a
shameful
theory
it
does
not
reckon
on
courage
but
on
the
amount
of
human
flesh
it
is
a
reflection
on
the
soul
great
and
small
orators
all
who
speak
of
military
matters
talk
only
of
masses
war
is
waged
by
enormous
masses
etc
in
the
masses
man
as
an
individual
disappears
the
number
only
is
seen
quality
is
forgotten
and
yet
as
always
quality
alone
produces
real
effect
the
prussians
conquered
at
sadowa
with
made
soldiers
united
accustomed
to
discipline
such
soldiers
can
be
made
in
three
or
four
years
now
for
the
material
training
of
the
soldier
is
not
indeed
so
difficult
caesar
had
legions
that
he
found
unseasoned
not
yet
dependable
which
had
been
formed
for
nine
years
austria
was
beaten
because
her
troops
were
of
poor
quality
because
they
were
conscripts
our
projected
organization
will
give
us
four
hundred
thousand
good
soldiers
but
all
our
reserves
will
be
without
cohesion
if
they
are
thrown
into
this
or
that
organization
on
the
eve
of
battle
at
a
distance
numbers
of
troops
without
cohesion
may
be
impressive
but
close
up
they
are
reduced
to
fifty
or
per
cent
who
really
fight
wagram
was
not
too
well
executed
it
illustrated
desperate
efforts
that
had
for
once
a
moral
effect
on
an
impressionable
enemy
but
for
once
only
would
they
succeed
again
the
cimbrians
gave
an
example
and
man
has
not
changed
who
is
braver
than
they
were
and
they
did
not
have
to
face
artillery
nor
rifles
originally
napoleon
found
as
an
instrument
an
army
with
good
battle
methods
and
in
his
best
battles
combat
followed
these
methods
he
himself
prescribed
at
least
so
they
say
for
he
misrepresented
at
saint
helena
the
methods
used
at
wagram
at
eylau
at
waterloo
and
engaged
enormous
masses
of
infantry
which
did
not
give
material
effect
but
it
involved
a
frightful
loss
of
men
and
a
disorder
that
after
they
had
once
been
unleashed
did
not
permit
of
the
rallying
and
reemployment
that
day
of
the
troops
engaged
this
was
a
barbaric
method
according
to
the
romans
amateurish
if
we
may
say
such
a
thing
of
such
a
man
a
method
which
could
not
be
used
against
experienced
and
well
trained
troops
such
as
corps
at
waterloo
it
proved
disastrous
napoleon
looked
only
at
the
result
to
be
attained
when
his
impatience
or
perhaps
the
lack
of
experience
and
knowledge
in
his
officers
and
soldiers
forbade
his
continued
use
of
real
attack
tactics
he
completely
sacrificed
the
material
effect
of
infantry
and
even
that
of
cavalry
to
the
moral
effect
of
masses
the
personnel
of
his
armies
was
too
changing
in
ancient
battle
victory
cost
much
less
than
with
modern
armies
and
the
same
soldiers
remained
longer
in
ranks
at
the
end
of
his
campaigns
when
he
had
soldiers
sixty
years
old
alexander
had
lost
only
seven
hundred
men
by
the
sword
napoleon
system
is
more
practicable
with
the
russians
who
naturally
group
together
mass
up
but
it
is
not
the
most
effective
note
the
mass
formation
at
inkermann
what
did
napoleon
i
do
he
reduced
the
rôle
of
man
in
battle
and
depended
instead
on
formed
masses
we
have
not
such
magnificent
material
infantry
and
cavalry
masses
showed
toward
the
end
of
the
empire
a
tactical
degeneracy
resulting
from
the
wearing
down
of
their
elements
and
the
consequent
lowering
of
standards
of
morale
and
training
but
since
the
allies
had
recognized
and
adopted
our
methods
napoleon
really
had
a
reason
for
trying
something
so
old
that
it
was
new
to
secure
that
surprise
which
will
give
victory
once
it
can
give
victory
only
once
however
tried
again
surprise
will
be
lacking
this
was
sort
of
a
desperate
method
which
napoleon
supremacy
allowed
him
to
adopt
when
he
saw
his
prestige
waning
when
misfortune
and
lack
of
cannon
fodder
oppressed
him
napoleon
became
again
the
practical
man
not
blinded
by
his
supremacy
his
entire
good
sense
his
genius
overcame
the
madness
to
conquer
at
all
price
and
we
have
his
campaign
of
general
ambert
says
without
military
traditions
almost
without
a
command
these
confused
masses
the
american
armies
of
the
civil
war
struck
as
men
struck
at
agincourt
and
crecy
at
agincourt
and
crecy
we
struck
very
little
but
were
struck
a
lot
these
battles
were
great
slaughters
of
frenchmen
by
english
and
other
frenchmen
who
did
not
greatly
suffer
themselves
in
what
except
in
disorder
did
the
american
battles
resemble
these
butcheries
with
the
knife
the
americans
were
engaged
as
skirmishers
at
a
distance
of
leagues
in
seeking
a
resemblance
the
general
has
been
carried
away
by
the
mania
for
victory
is
always
for
the
strong
battalions
this
is
true
if
sixty
determined
men
can
rout
a
battalion
these
sixty
must
be
found
perhaps
only
as
many
will
be
found
as
the
enemy
has
battalions
note
gideon
proportion
of
three
hundred
to
thirty
thousand
of
one
to
one
hundred
perhaps
it
would
be
far
and
away
better
under
these
circumstances
to
fight
at
night
combat
methods
ancient
battle
was
fought
in
a
confined
space
the
commander
could
see
his
whole
force
seeing
clearly
his
account
should
have
been
clear
although
we
note
that
many
of
these
ancient
accounts
are
obscure
and
incomplete
and
that
we
have
to
supplement
them
in
modern
battle
nobody
knows
what
goes
on
or
what
has
gone
on
except
from
results
narrations
can
not
enter
into
details
of
execution
it
is
interesting
to
compare
tales
of
feats
of
arms
narrated
by
the
victor
or
the
vanquished
it
is
hard
to
tell
which
account
is
truthful
if
either
mere
assurance
may
carry
weight
military
politics
may
dictate
a
perversion
of
the
facts
for
disciplinary
moral
or
political
reasons
note
it
is
difficult
even
to
determine
losses
the
leaders
are
such
consummate
liars
why
is
this
it
is
bewildering
to
read
a
french
account
and
then
a
foreign
account
of
the
same
event
the
facts
stated
are
so
entirely
different
what
is
the
truth
only
results
can
reveal
it
such
results
as
the
losses
on
both
sides
they
are
really
instructive
if
they
can
be
gotten
at
i
believe
that
under
turenne
there
was
not
existent
to
the
same
degree
a
national
pride
which
tended
to
hide
unpleasant
truths
the
troops
in
contending
armies
were
often
of
the
same
nation
if
national
vanity
and
pride
were
not
so
touchy
about
recent
occurrences
still
passionately
debated
numerous
lessons
might
be
drawn
from
our
last
wars
who
can
speak
impartially
of
waterloo
or
waterloo
so
much
discussed
and
with
such
heat
without
being
ashamed
had
waterloo
been
won
it
would
not
have
profited
us
napoleon
attempted
the
impossible
which
is
beyond
even
genius
after
a
terrible
fight
against
english
firmness
and
tenacity
a
fight
in
which
we
were
not
able
to
subdue
them
the
prussians
appear
we
would
have
done
no
better
had
they
not
appeared
but
they
did
very
conveniently
to
sustain
our
pride
they
were
confronted
then
the
rout
began
it
did
not
begin
in
the
troops
facing
the
prussians
but
in
those
facing
the
english
who
were
exhausted
perhaps
but
not
more
so
than
their
enemies
this
was
the
moral
effect
of
an
attack
on
their
right
when
they
had
rather
expected
reinforcements
to
appear
the
right
conformed
to
the
retrograde
movement
and
what
a
movement
it
was
why
do
not
authorities
acknowledge
facts
and
try
to
formulate
combat
methods
that
conform
to
reality
it
would
reduce
a
little
the
disorder
that
bothers
men
not
warned
of
it
they
jump
perhaps
from
the
frying
pan
into
the
fire
i
have
known
two
colonels
one
of
them
a
very
brave
man
who
said
let
soldiers
alone
before
the
enemy
they
know
what
to
do
better
than
you
do
this
is
a
fine
statement
of
french
confidence
that
they
know
better
than
you
what
should
be
done
especially
in
a
panic
i
suppose
a
long
time
ago
the
prince
de
ligne
justified
battle
formations
above
all
the
famous
oblique
formation
napoleon
decided
the
question
all
discussion
of
formations
is
pedantry
but
there
are
moral
reasons
for
the
power
of
the
depth
formation
the
difference
between
practice
and
theory
is
incredible
a
general
who
has
given
directions
a
thousand
times
on
the
battle
field
when
asked
for
directions
gives
this
order
go
there
colonel
the
colonel
a
man
of
good
sense
says
will
you
explain
sir
what
point
do
you
want
me
to
guide
on
how
far
should
i
extend
is
there
anybody
on
my
right
on
my
left
the
general
says
advance
on
the
enemy
sir
it
seems
to
me
that
that
ought
to
be
enough
what
does
this
hesitation
mean
but
my
dear
general
what
are
your
orders
an
officer
should
know
where
his
command
is
and
the
command
itself
should
know
space
is
large
if
you
do
not
know
where
to
send
your
troops
and
how
to
direct
them
to
make
them
understand
where
they
are
to
go
to
give
them
guides
if
necessary
what
sort
of
general
are
you
what
is
our
method
for
occupying
a
fortified
work
or
a
line
we
have
none
why
not
adopt
that
of
marshal
saxe
ask
several
generals
how
they
would
do
it
they
will
not
know
there
is
always
mad
impatience
for
results
without
considering
the
means
a
general
ability
lies
in
judging
the
best
moment
for
attack
and
in
knowing
how
to
prepare
for
it
we
took
melegnano
without
artillery
without
maneuver
but
at
what
a
price
at
waterloo
the
hougoumont
farm
held
us
up
all
day
cost
us
dear
and
disorganized
us
into
a
mad
mob
until
napoleon
finally
sent
eight
mortars
to
smash
and
burn
the
château
this
is
what
should
have
been
done
at
the
commencement
of
the
general
attack
a
rational
and
ordered
method
of
combat
or
if
not
ordered
known
to
all
is
enough
to
make
good
troops
if
there
is
discipline
be
it
understood
the
portuguese
infantry
in
the
spanish
war
to
whom
the
english
had
taught
their
method
of
combat
almost
rivalled
the
english
infantry
who
has
formulated
method
who
has
a
traditional
method
ask
the
generals
no
two
will
agree
we
have
a
method
a
manner
rather
that
accords
with
the
national
tendency
that
of
skirmishers
in
large
numbers
but
this
formation
is
nowhere
formulated
before
a
campaign
it
is
decried
properly
so
for
it
degenerates
rapidly
into
a
flock
of
lost
sheep
consequently
troops
come
to
the
battle
field
entirely
unused
to
reality
all
the
leaders
all
the
officers
are
confused
and
unoriented
this
goes
so
far
that
often
generals
are
found
who
have
lost
their
divisions
or
brigades
staff
officers
who
have
lost
their
generals
and
their
divisions
both
and
although
this
is
more
easily
understood
many
company
officers
who
have
lost
their
commands
this
is
a
serious
matter
which
might
cost
us
dear
in
a
prolonged
war
in
which
the
enemy
gains
experience
let
us
hope
that
experience
will
lead
us
not
to
change
the
principle
but
to
modify
and
form
in
a
practical
way
our
characteristic
battle
method
of
escaping
by
advancing
the
brochure
of
the
prince
of
prussia
shows
that
without
having
fought
us
the
prussians
understand
our
methods
there
are
men
such
as
marshal
bugeaud
who
are
born
warriors
in
character
mental
attitude
intelligence
and
temperament
they
recommend
and
show
by
example
such
as
colonel
bugeaud
battles
in
at
the
hospital
bridge
tactics
entirely
appropriate
to
their
national
and
personal
characters
note
wellington
and
the
duke
of
york
among
the
english
but
the
execution
of
tactics
such
as
requires
officers
who
resemble
their
commanders
at
least
in
courage
and
decisions
all
officers
are
not
of
such
temper
there
is
need
then
of
prescribed
tactics
conforming
to
the
national
character
which
may
serve
to
guide
an
ordinary
officer
without
requiring
him
to
have
the
exceptional
ability
of
a
bugeaud
such
prescribed
tactics
would
serve
an
officer
as
the
perfectly
clear
and
well
defined
tactics
of
the
roman
legion
served
the
legion
commander
the
officer
could
not
neglect
them
without
failing
in
his
duty
of
course
they
will
not
make
him
an
exceptional
leader
but
except
in
case
of
utter
incapacity
they
will
keep
him
from
entirely
failing
in
his
task
from
making
absurd
mistakes
nor
will
they
prevent
officers
of
bugeaud
temper
from
using
their
ability
they
will
on
the
contrary
help
them
by
putting
under
their
command
men
prepared
for
the
details
of
battle
which
will
not
then
come
to
them
as
a
surprise
this
method
need
not
be
as
completely
dogmatic
as
the
roman
our
battle
is
too
varying
an
affair
but
some
clearly
defined
rules
established
by
experience
would
prevent
the
gross
errors
of
inefficients
such
as
causing
skirmishers
to
fall
back
when
the
formed
rank
fires
and
consequently
allowing
them
to
carry
with
them
in
their
retreat
the
rank
itself
they
would
be
useful
aids
to
men
of
coolness
and
decision
the
laying
down
of
such
tactics
would
answer
the
many
who
hold
that
everything
is
improvised
on
the
battle
field
and
who
find
no
better
improvisation
than
to
leave
the
soldier
to
himself
see
above
we
should
try
to
exercise
some
control
over
our
soldiers
who
advance
by
flight
note
the
vendeans
or
escape
by
advancing
as
you
like
but
if
something
unexpected
surprises
them
they
flee
as
precipitately
invention
is
less
needed
than
verification
demonstration
and
organization
of
proper
methods
to
verify
observe
better
to
demonstrate
try
out
and
describe
better
to
organize
distribute
better
bearing
in
mind
that
cohesion
means
discipline
i
do
not
know
who
put
things
that
way
but
it
is
truer
than
ever
in
this
day
of
invention
with
us
very
few
reason
or
understand
reason
very
few
are
cool
their
effect
is
negligible
in
the
disorder
of
the
mass
it
is
lost
in
numbers
it
follows
that
we
above
all
need
a
method
of
combat
sanely
thought
out
in
advance
it
must
be
based
on
the
fact
that
we
are
not
passively
obedient
instruments
but
very
nervous
and
restless
people
who
wish
to
finish
things
quickly
and
to
know
in
advance
where
we
are
going
it
must
be
based
on
the
fact
that
we
are
very
proud
people
but
people
who
would
all
skulk
if
we
were
not
seen
and
who
consequently
must
always
be
seen
and
act
in
the
presence
of
our
comrades
and
of
the
officers
who
supervise
us
from
this
comes
the
necessity
for
organizing
the
infantry
company
solidly
it
is
the
infantryman
on
whom
the
battle
has
the
most
violent
effect
for
he
is
always
most
exposed
it
is
he
therefore
who
must
be
the
most
solidly
supported
unity
must
be
secured
by
a
mutual
acquaintanceship
of
long
standing
between
all
elements
if
you
only
use
combat
methods
that
require
leaders
without
fear
of
high
intelligence
full
of
good
sense
of
esprit
you
will
always
make
mistakes
bugeaud
method
was
the
best
for
him
but
it
is
evident
in
his
fight
at
the
hospital
bridge
that
his
battalion
commanders
were
useless
if
he
had
not
been
there
all
would
have
been
lost
he
alone
omnipresent
was
capable
of
resolute
blows
that
the
others
could
not
execute
his
system
can
be
summed
up
in
two
phrases
always
attack
even
when
on
the
defensive
fire
and
take
cover
only
when
not
attacked
his
method
was
rational
considering
his
mentality
and
the
existing
conditions
but
in
carrying
it
into
execution
he
judged
his
officers
and
soldiers
by
himself
and
was
deceived
no
dogmatic
principles
can
be
drawn
from
his
method
nor
from
any
other
man
is
always
man
he
does
not
always
possess
ability
and
resolution
the
commander
must
make
his
choice
of
methods
depending
on
his
troops
and
on
himself
the
essential
of
tactics
is
the
science
of
making
men
fight
with
their
maximum
energy
this
alone
can
give
an
organization
with
which
to
fight
fear
this
has
always
been
true
we
must
start
here
and
figure
mathematically
mathematics
is
the
dominant
science
in
war
just
as
battle
is
its
only
purpose
pride
generally
causes
refusal
to
acknowledge
the
truth
that
fear
of
being
vanquished
is
basic
in
war
in
the
mass
pride
vanity
is
responsible
for
this
dissimulation
with
the
tiny
number
of
absolutely
fearless
men
what
is
responsible
is
their
ignorance
of
a
thing
they
do
not
feel
there
is
however
no
real
basis
but
this
and
all
real
tactics
are
based
on
it
discipline
is
a
part
of
tactics
is
absolutely
at
the
base
of
tactics
as
the
romans
showed
they
excelled
the
gauls
in
intelligence
but
not
in
bravery
to
start
with
take
battalions
of
four
companies
four
platoons
each
in
line
or
in
column
the
order
of
battle
may
be
two
platoons
deployed
as
skirmishers
two
companies
in
reserve
under
command
of
the
battalion
commander
in
obtaining
a
decision
destructive
action
will
come
from
skirmishers
this
action
should
be
directed
by
battalion
commanders
but
such
direction
is
not
customary
no
effect
will
be
secured
from
skirmishers
at
six
hundred
paces
they
will
never
never
never
be
nicely
aligned
in
front
of
their
battalions
calm
and
collected
after
an
advance
they
will
not
even
at
maneuvers
the
battalion
commander
ought
to
be
advanced
enough
to
direct
his
skirmishers
the
whole
battalion
engaged
ready
for
any
effort
ought
to
remain
under
his
command
under
his
personal
direction
as
far
as
possible
in
the
advance
the
officers
the
soldiers
are
content
if
they
are
merely
directed
but
when
the
battle
becomes
hot
they
must
see
their
commander
know
him
to
be
near
it
does
not
matter
even
if
he
is
without
initiative
incapable
of
giving
an
order
his
presence
creates
a
belief
that
direction
exists
that
orders
exist
and
that
is
enough
when
the
skirmishers
meet
with
resistance
they
fall
back
to
the
ranks
it
is
the
rôle
of
reserves
to
support
and
reinforce
the
line
and
above
all
by
a
swift
charge
to
cut
the
enemy
line
this
then
falls
back
and
the
skirmishers
go
forward
again
if
the
advance
is
resumed
the
second
line
should
be
in
the
formation
battalions
in
line
or
in
column
that
hides
it
best
cover
the
infantry
troops
before
their
entry
into
action
cover
them
as
much
as
possible
and
by
any
means
take
advantage
of
the
terrain
make
them
lie
down
this
is
the
english
method
in
defense
of
heights
instanced
in
spain
and
at
waterloo
only
one
bugle
to
each
battalion
should
sound
calls
what
else
is
there
to
be
provided
for
many
haughty
generals
would
scream
protests
like
eagles
if
it
were
suggested
that
they
take
such
precautions
for
second
line
battalions
or
first
line
troops
not
committed
to
action
yet
this
is
merely
a
sane
measure
to
insure
good
order
without
the
slightest
implication
of
cowardice
with
weapons
the
skirmishers
on
the
defensive
fire
almost
always
from
a
prone
position
they
are
made
to
rise
with
difficulty
either
for
retreat
or
for
advance
this
renders
the
defense
more
tenacious
chapter
ii
infantry
masses
deep
columns
study
of
the
effect
of
columns
brings
us
to
the
consideration
of
mass
operations
in
general
read
this
singular
argument
in
favor
of
attacks
by
battalions
in
close
columns
a
column
can
not
stop
instantly
without
a
command
suppose
your
first
rank
stops
at
the
instant
of
shock
the
twelve
ranks
of
the
battalion
coming
up
successively
would
come
in
contact
with
it
pushing
it
forward
experiments
made
have
shown
that
beyond
the
sixteenth
the
impulsion
of
the
ranks
in
rear
has
no
effect
on
the
front
it
is
completely
taken
up
by
the
fifteen
ranks
already
massed
behind
the
first
to
make
the
experiment
march
at
charging
pace
and
command
halt
to
the
front
rank
without
warning
the
rest
the
ranks
will
precipitate
themselves
upon
each
other
unless
they
be
very
attentive
or
unless
anticipating
the
command
they
check
themselves
unconsciously
while
marching
but
in
a
real
charge
all
your
ranks
are
attentive
restless
anxious
about
what
is
taking
place
at
the
front
and
if
the
latter
halts
if
the
first
line
stops
there
will
be
a
movement
to
the
rear
and
not
to
the
front
take
a
good
battalion
possessed
of
extraordinary
calmness
and
coolness
thrown
full
speed
on
the
enemy
at
one
hundred
and
twenty
steps
to
the
minute
it
would
have
to
advance
under
a
fire
of
five
shots
a
minute
at
this
last
desperate
moment
if
the
front
rank
stops
it
will
not
be
pushed
according
to
the
theory
of
successive
impulses
it
will
be
upset
the
second
line
will
arrive
only
to
fall
over
the
first
and
so
on
there
should
be
a
drill
ground
test
to
see
up
to
what
rank
this
falling
of
the
pasteboard
figures
would
extend
physical
impulse
is
merely
a
word
if
the
front
rank
stops
it
will
let
itself
fall
and
be
trampled
under
foot
rather
than
cede
to
the
pressure
that
pushes
it
forward
any
one
experienced
in
infantry
engagements
of
knows
that
is
just
what
happens
this
shows
the
error
of
the
theory
of
physical
impulse
a
theory
that
continues
to
dictate
as
under
the
empire
so
strong
is
routine
and
prejudice
attacks
in
close
column
such
attacks
are
marked
by
absolute
disorder
and
lack
of
leadership
take
a
battalion
fresh
from
barracks
in
light
marching
order
intent
only
on
the
maneuver
to
be
executed
it
marches
in
close
column
in
good
order
its
subdivisions
are
full
four
paces
apart
the
officers
control
the
men
but
it
is
true
that
if
the
terrain
is
slightly
accidented
if
the
guide
does
not
march
with
mathematical
precision
the
battalion
in
close
column
becomes
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
a
flock
of
sheep
what
would
happen
to
a
battalion
in
such
a
formation
at
one
hundred
paces
from
the
enemy
nobody
will
ever
see
such
an
instance
in
these
days
of
the
rifle
if
the
battalion
has
marched
resolutely
if
it
is
in
good
order
it
is
ten
to
one
that
the
enemy
has
already
withdrawn
without
waiting
any
longer
but
suppose
the
enemy
does
not
flinch
then
the
man
of
our
days
naked
against
iron
and
lead
no
longer
controls
himself
the
instinct
of
preservation
controls
him
absolutely
there
are
two
ways
of
avoiding
or
diminishing
the
danger
they
are
to
flee
or
to
throw
upon
it
let
us
rush
upon
it
now
however
small
the
intervals
of
space
and
time
that
separate
us
from
the
enemy
instinct
shows
itself
we
rush
forward
but
generally
we
rush
with
prudence
with
a
tendency
to
let
the
most
urgent
ones
the
most
intrepid
ones
pass
on
it
is
strange
but
true
that
the
nearer
we
approach
the
enemy
the
less
we
are
closed
up
adieu
to
the
theory
of
pressure
if
the
front
rank
is
stopped
those
behind
fall
down
rather
than
push
it
even
if
this
front
rank
is
pushed
it
will
itself
fall
down
rather
than
advance
there
is
nothing
to
wonder
at
it
is
sheer
fact
any
pushing
is
to
the
rear
battle
of
diernstein
more
than
ever
flight
begins
in
the
rear
which
is
affected
quite
as
much
as
the
front
mass
attacks
are
incomprehensible
not
one
out
of
ten
was
ever
carried
to
completion
and
none
of
them
could
be
maintained
against
they
can
be
explained
only
by
the
lack
of
confidence
of
the
generals
in
their
troops
napoleon
expressly
condemns
in
his
memoirs
such
attacks
he
therefore
never
ordered
them
but
when
good
troops
were
used
up
and
his
generals
believed
they
could
not
obtain
from
young
troops
determined
attacks
in
tactical
formation
they
came
back
to
the
mass
formation
which
belongs
to
the
infancy
of
the
art
as
a
desperate
resort
if
you
use
this
method
of
pressing
of
pushing
your
force
will
disappear
as
before
a
magician
wand
but
the
enemy
does
not
stand
the
moral
pressure
of
danger
that
precedes
you
is
too
strong
for
him
otherwise
those
who
stood
and
aimed
even
with
empty
rifles
would
never
see
a
charge
come
up
to
them
the
first
line
of
the
assailant
would
be
sensible
of
death
and
no
one
would
wish
to
be
in
the
first
rank
therefore
the
enemy
never
merely
stands
because
if
he
does
it
is
you
that
flee
this
always
does
away
with
the
shock
the
enemy
entertains
no
smaller
anxiety
than
yours
when
he
sees
you
near
for
him
also
the
question
is
whether
to
flee
or
to
advance
two
moral
impulses
are
in
conflict
this
is
the
instinctive
reasoning
of
the
officer
and
soldier
if
these
men
wait
for
me
to
close
with
them
it
means
death
i
will
kill
but
i
will
undoubtedly
be
killed
at
the
muzzle
of
the
the
bullet
can
not
fail
to
find
its
mark
but
if
i
can
frighten
them
they
will
run
away
i
can
shoot
them
and
bayonet
in
the
back
let
us
make
a
try
at
it
the
trial
is
made
and
one
of
the
two
forces
at
some
stage
of
the
advance
perhaps
only
at
two
paces
makes
an
about
and
gets
the
bayonet
in
the
back
imagination
always
sees
loaded
arms
and
this
fancy
is
catching
the
shock
is
a
mere
term
the
de
saxe
the
bugeaud
theory
close
with
the
bayonet
and
with
fire
action
at
close
quarters
that
is
what
kills
people
and
the
victor
is
the
one
who
kills
most
is
not
founded
on
fact
no
enemy
awaits
you
if
you
are
determined
and
never
never
never
are
two
equal
determinations
opposed
to
each
other
it
is
well
known
to
everybody
to
all
nations
that
the
french
have
never
met
any
one
who
resisted
a
bayonet
charge
the
english
in
spain
marching
resolutely
in
face
of
the
charges
of
the
french
in
column
have
always
defeated
them
the
english
were
not
dismayed
at
the
mass
if
napoleon
had
recalled
the
defeat
of
the
giants
of
the
armada
by
the
english
vessels
he
might
not
have
ordered
the
use
of
the
column
blücher
in
his
instructions
to
his
troops
recalled
that
the
french
have
never
held
out
before
the
resolute
march
of
the
prussians
in
attack
column
suvaroff
used
no
better
tactics
yet
his
battalions
in
italy
drove
us
at
the
point
of
their
bayonets
each
nation
in
europe
says
no
one
stands
his
ground
before
a
bayonet
charge
made
by
us
all
are
right
the
french
no
more
than
others
resist
a
resolute
attack
all
are
persuaded
that
their
attacks
are
irresistable
that
an
advance
will
frighten
the
enemy
into
flight
whether
the
bayonet
be
fixed
or
in
the
scabbard
makes
no
difference
there
is
an
old
saying
that
young
troops
become
uneasy
if
any
one
comes
upon
them
in
a
tumult
and
in
disorder
the
old
troops
on
the
contrary
see
victory
therein
at
the
commencement
of
a
war
all
troops
are
young
our
impetuosity
pushes
us
to
the
front
like
fools
the
enemy
flees
if
the
war
lasts
everybody
becomes
inured
the
enemy
no
longer
troubles
himself
when
in
front
of
troops
charging
in
a
disordered
way
because
he
knows
and
feels
that
they
are
moved
as
much
by
fear
as
by
determination
good
order
alone
impresses
the
enemy
in
an
attack
for
it
indicates
real
determination
that
is
why
it
is
necessary
to
secure
good
order
and
retain
it
to
the
very
last
it
is
unwise
to
take
the
running
step
prematurely
because
you
become
a
flock
of
sheep
and
leave
so
many
men
behind
that
you
will
not
reach
your
objective
the
close
column
is
absurd
it
turns
you
in
advance
into
a
flock
of
sheep
where
officers
and
men
are
jumbled
together
without
mutual
support
it
is
then
necessary
to
march
as
far
as
possible
in
such
order
as
best
permits
the
action
of
the
officers
the
action
of
unity
every
one
marching
in
front
of
in
the
open
on
the
other
hand
in
closed
columns
man
marches
unobserved
and
on
the
slightest
pretext
he
lies
down
or
remains
behind
therefore
it
is
best
always
to
keep
the
skirmishers
in
advance
or
on
the
flanks
and
never
to
recall
them
when
in
proximity
to
the
enemy
to
do
so
establishes
a
counter
current
that
carries
away
your
men
let
your
skirmishers
alone
they
are
your
lost
children
they
will
know
best
how
to
take
care
of
themselves
to
sum
up
there
is
no
shock
of
infantry
on
infantry
there
is
no
physical
impulse
no
force
of
mass
there
is
but
a
moral
impulse
no
one
denies
that
this
moral
impulse
is
stronger
as
one
feels
better
supported
that
it
has
greater
effect
on
the
enemy
as
it
menaces
him
with
more
men
from
this
it
follows
that
the
column
is
more
valuable
for
the
attack
than
the
deployed
order
it
might
be
concluded
from
this
long
statement
that
a
moral
pressure
which
always
causes
flight
when
a
bold
attack
is
made
would
not
permit
any
infantry
to
hold
out
against
a
cavalry
charge
never
indeed
against
a
determined
charge
but
infantry
must
resist
when
it
is
not
possible
to
flee
and
until
there
is
complete
demoralization
absolute
terror
the
infantry
appreciates
this
every
infantryman
knows
it
is
folly
to
flee
before
cavalry
when
the
rifle
is
infallible
at
at
least
from
the
rider
point
of
view
it
is
true
that
every
really
bold
charge
ought
to
succeed
but
whether
man
is
on
foot
or
on
horseback
he
is
always
man
while
on
foot
he
has
but
himself
to
force
on
horseback
he
must
force
man
and
beast
to
march
against
the
enemy
and
mounted
to
flee
is
so
easy
remark
by
varney
we
have
seen
than
in
an
infantry
mass
those
in
rear
are
powerless
to
push
those
in
front
unless
the
danger
is
greater
in
rear
the
cavalry
has
long
understood
this
it
attacks
in
a
column
at
double
distance
rather
than
at
in
order
to
avoid
the
frightful
confusion
of
the
mass
and
yet
the
allurement
of
mathematical
reasoning
is
such
that
cavalry
officers
especially
the
germans
have
seriously
proposed
attacking
infantry
by
deep
masses
so
that
the
units
in
rear
might
give
impulse
to
those
in
front
they
cite
the
proverb
one
nail
drives
the
other
what
can
you
say
to
people
who
talk
such
nonsense
nothing
except
attack
us
always
in
this
way
real
bayonet
attacks
occurred
in
the
crimean
war
inkermann
they
were
carried
out
by
a
small
force
against
a
larger
one
the
power
of
mass
had
no
influence
in
such
cases
it
was
the
mass
which
fell
back
turned
tail
even
before
the
shock
the
troops
who
made
the
bold
charge
did
nothing
but
strike
and
fire
at
backs
these
instances
show
men
unexpectedly
finding
themselves
face
to
face
with
the
enemy
at
a
distance
at
which
a
man
can
close
fearlessly
without
falling
out
on
the
way
breathless
they
are
chance
encounters
man
is
not
yet
demoralized
by
fire
he
must
strike
or
fall
back
combat
at
close
quarters
does
not
exist
at
close
quarters
occurs
the
ancient
carnage
when
one
force
strikes
the
other
in
the
back
columns
have
absolutely
but
a
moral
effect
they
are
threatening
dispositions
the
mass
impulse
of
cavalry
has
long
been
discredited
you
have
given
up
forming
it
in
deep
ranks
although
cavalry
possesses
a
speed
that
would
bring
on
more
of
a
push
upon
the
front
at
a
halt
than
the
last
ranks
of
the
infantry
would
bring
upon
the
first
yet
you
believe
in
the
mass
action
of
infantry
as
long
as
the
ancient
masses
marched
forward
they
did
not

above
all

man
protests
against
such
use
of
his

the
frenchman
wants
to
fight
to
return
blow
for
blow
if
he
is
not
allowed
to
this
is
what
happens
it
happened
to
napoleon
masses
let
us
take
wagram
where
his
mass
was
not
repulsed
out
of
thousand
men
three
thousand
to
fifteen
hundred
reached
the
position
certainly
the
position
was
not
carried
by
them
but
by
the
material
and
moral
effect
of
a
battery
of
one
hundred
pieces
cavalry
etc
were
the
nineteen
thousand
missing
men
disabled
no
seven
out
of
a
third
an
enormous
proportion
may
have
been
hit
what
became
of
the
twelve
thousand
unaccounted
for
they
had
lain
down
on
the
road
had
played
dummy
in
order
not
to
go
on
to
the
end
in
the
confused
mass
of
a
column
of
deployed
battalions
surveillance
difficult
enough
in
a
column
at
normal
distances
is
impossible
nothing
is
easier
than
dropping
out
through
inertia
nothing
more
common
this
thing
happens
to
every
body
of
troops
marching
forward
under
fire
in
whatever
formation
it
may
be
the
number
of
men
falling
out
in
this
way
giving
up
at
the
least
opportunity
is
greater
as
formation
is
less
fixed
and
the
surveillance
of
officers
and
comrades
more
difficult
in
a
battalion
in
closed
column
this
kind
of
temporary
desertion
is
enormous
of
the
men
drop
out
on
the
way
the
first
platoon
is
mingled
with
the
fourth
they
are
really
a
flock
of
sheep
no
one
has
control
all
being
mixed
even
if
in
virtue
of
the
first
impulse
the
position
is
carried
the
disorder
is
so
great
that
if
it
is
by
four
men
it
is
lost
the
condition
of
morale
of
such
masses
is
fully
described
in
the
battle
of
caesar
against
the
nervii
marius
against
the
cimbri
what
better
arguments
against
deep
columns
could
there
be
than
the
denials
of
napoleon
at
helena
skirmishers
supports
reserves
squares
this
is
singular
the
cavalry
has
definite
tactics
essentially
it
knows
how
it
fights
the
infantry
does
not
our
infantry
no
longer
has
any
battle
tactics
the
initiative
of
the
soldier
rules
the
soldiers
of
the
first
empire
trusted
to
the
moral
and
passive
action
of
masses
the
soldiers
object
to
the
passive
action
of
masses
they
fight
as
skirmishers
or
they
march
to
the
front
as
a
flock
of
sheep
of
which
seek
cover
enroute
if
the
fire
is
heavy
the
first
method
although
better
than
the
second
is
bad
unless
iron
discipline
and
studied
and
practical
methods
of
fighting
insure
maintaining
strong
reserves
these
should
be
in
the
hands
of
the
leaders
and
officers
for
support
purposes
to
guard
against
panics
and
to
finish
by
the
moral
effect
of
a
march
on
the
enemy
of
flank
menaces
the
destructive
action
of
the
skirmishers
when
the
ballistic
arm
is
so
deadly
so
effective
a
unit
which
closes
up
in
order
to
fight
is
a
unit
in
which
morale
is
weakened
maneuver
is
possible
only
with
good
organization
otherwise
it
is
no
more
effective
than
the
passive
mass
or
a
rabble
in
an
attack
in
ancient
combat
the
soldier
was
controlled
by
the
leader
in
engagements
now
that
fighting
is
open
the
soldier
can
not
be
controlled
often
he
can
not
even
be
directed
consequently
it
is
necessary
to
begin
an
action
at
the
latest
possible
moment
and
to
have
the
immediate
commanders
understand
what
is
wanted
what
their
objectives
are
etc
in
the
modern
engagement
the
infantryman
gets
from
under
our
control
by
scattering
and
we
say
a
soldier
war
wrong
wrong
to
solve
this
problem
instead
of
scattering
to
the
winds
let
us
increase
the
number
of
rallying
points
by
solidifying
the
companies
from
them
come
battalions
from
battalions
come
regiments
action
in
open
order
was
not
possible
nor
evident
under
turenne
the
majority
of
the
soldiers
that
composed
the
army
were
not
held
near
at
hand
in
formation
they
fought
badly
there
was
a
general
seeking
for
cover
note
the
conduct
of
the
americans
in
their
late
war
the
organization
of
the
legion
of
marshal
saxe
shows
the
strength
of
the
tendency
toward
shock
action
as
opposed
to
fire
action
the
drills
parades
and
firing
at
potsdam
were
not
the
tactics
of
old
fritz
frederick
secret
was
promptitude
and
rapidity
of
movement
but
they
were
popularly
believed
to
be
his
means
people
were
fond
of
them
and
are
yet
the
prussians
for
all
their
leaning
toward
parade
mathematics
ended
by
adopting
the
best
methods
the
prussians
of
jena
were
taken
in
themselves
by
frederick
methods
but
since
then
they
have
been
the
first
to
strike
out
in
a
practical
way
while
we
in
france
are
still
laboring
at
the
potsdam
drills
the
greater
number
of
generals
who
fought
in
the
last
wars
under
real
battle
conditions
ask
for
skirmishers
in
large
units
well
supported
our
men
have
such
a
strong
tendency
to
place
themselves
in
such
units
even
against
the
will
of
their
leaders
that
they
do
not
fight
otherwise
a
number
of
respectable
authors
and
military
men
advocate
the
use
of
skirmishers
in
large
bodies
as
being
dictated
by
certain
necessities
of
war
ask
them
to
elucidate
this
mode
of
action
and
you
will
see
that
this
talk
of
skirmishers
in
large
bodies
is
nothing
else
but
an
euphemism
for
absolute
disorder
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
fit
the
theory
to
the
fact
yet
the
use
of
skirmishers
in
large
bodies
is
absurd
with
frenchmen
under
fire
when
the
terrain
and
the
sharpness
of
the
action
cause
the
initiative
and
direction
to
escape
from
the
commanders
and
leave
it
to
the
men
to
small
groups
of
soldiers
arms
are
for
use
the
best
disposition
for
material
effect
in
attack
or
defense
is
that
which
permits
the
easiest
and
most
deadly
use
of
arms
this
disposition
is
the
scattered
thin
line
the
whole
of
the
science
of
combat
lies
then
in
the
happy
proper
combination
of
the
open
order
scattered
to
secure
destructive
effect
and
a
good
disposition
of
troops
in
formation
as
supports
and
reserves
so
as
to
finish
by
moral
effect
the
action
of
the
advanced
troops
the
proper
combination
varies
with
the
enemy
his
morale
and
the
terrain
on
the
other
hand
the
thin
line
can
have
good
order
only
with
a
severe
discipline
a
unity
which
our
men
attain
from
pride
pride
exists
only
among
people
who
know
each
other
well
who
have
esprit
de
corps
and
company
spirit
there
is
a
necessity
for
an
organization
that
renders
unity
possible
by
creating
the
real
individuality
of
the
company
is
unquestionably
one
of
the
most
powerful
motives
which
moves
our
men
they
do
not
wish
to
pass
for
cowards
in
the
eyes
of
their
comrades
if
they
march
forward
they
want
to
distinguish
themselves
after
every
attack
formation
not
the
formation
of
the
drill
ground
but
that
adopted
by
those
rallying
to
the
chief
those
marching
with
him
no
longer
exists
this
is
because
of
the
inherent
disorder
of
every
forward
march
under
fire
the
bewildered
men
even
the
officers
have
no
longer
the
eyes
of
their
comrades
or
of
their
commander
upon
them
sustaining
them
no
longer
impels
them
they
do
not
hold
out
the
least
puts
them
to
rout
the
experience
of
the
evening
ought
always
to
serve
the
day
following
but
as
the
next
day
is
never
identical
with
the
evening
before
the
counsel
of
experience
can
not
be
applied
to
the
latter
when
confused
battalions
shot
at
each
other
some
two
hundred
paces
for
some
time
with
arms
inferior
to
those
of
our
days
flight
commenced
at
the
wings
therefore
said
experience
let
us
reënforce
the
wings
and
the
battalion
was
placed
between
two
picked
companies
but
it
was
found
that
the
combat
methods
had
been
transformed
the
elite
companies
were
then
reassembled
into
picked
corps
and
the
battalion
weaker
than
ever
no
longer
had
reënforced
wings
perhaps
combat
in
open
order
predominates
and
the
companies
of
light
infantrymen
being
above
all
skirmishers
the
battalion
again
is
no
longer
supported
in
our
day
the
use
of
deployed
battalions
as
skirmishers
is
no
longer
possible
and
one
of
the
essential
reasons
for
picked
companies
is
the
strengthening
of
the
battalion
the
question
has
been
asked
who
saved
the
french
army
on
the
beresina
and
at
hanau
the
guard
it
is
true
but
outside
of
the
picked
corps
what
was
the
french
army
then
droves
not
troops
abnormal
times
abnormal
deeds
the
beresina
hanau
prove
nothing
with
the
arms
of
infantry
the
advantage
belongs
to
the
defense
which
is
completed
by
offensive
movements
carried
out
at
opportune
times
fire
is
four
or
five
times
more
rapid
even
if
quite
as
haphazard
as
in
the
days
of
muzzle
loaders
everybody
says
that
this
renders
impossible
the
charges
of
cavalry
against
infantry
which
has
not
been
completely
thrown
into
disorder
demoralized
what
then
must
happen
to
charges
of
infantry
which
marches
while
the
cavalry
charges
attacks
in
deep
masses
are
no
longer
seen
they
are
not
wise
and
never
were
wise
to
advance
to
the
attack
with
a
line
of
battalions
in
column
with
large
intervals
and
covered
by
a
thick
line
of
skirmishers
when
the
artillery
has
prepared
the
terrain
is
very
well
people
with
common
sense
have
never
done
otherwise
but
the
thick
line
of
skirmishers
is
essential
i
believe
that
is
the
crux
of
the
matter
but
enough
of
this
it
is
simple
prudence
for
the
artillery
to
prepare
the
infantry
action
by
a
moment
conversation
with
the
artillery
of
the
enemy
infantry
if
that
infantry
is
not
commanded
by
an
imbecile
as
it
sometimes
is
it
will
avoid
that
particular
conversation
the
arguments
of
which
would
break
it
up
although
they
may
not
be
directed
precisely
in
its
direction
all
other
things
being
equal
both
infantries
suffer
the
same
losses
in
the
artillery
duel
the
proportion
does
not
vary
however
complete
the
artillery
preparation
one
infantry
must
always
close
with
another
under
rapid
fire
from
troops
in
position
and
such
a
fire
is
more
than
ever
to
the
advantage
of
the
defense
ten
men
come
towards
me
they
are
at
four
hundred
meters
with
the
ancient
arm
i
have
time
to
kill
but
two
before
they
reach
me
with
rapid
fire
i
have
time
to
kill
four
or
five
morale
does
not
increase
with
losses
the
eight
remaining
might
reach
me
in
the
first
case
the
five
or
six
remaining
will
certainly
not
in
the
second
if
distance
be
taken
the
leader
can
be
seen
the
see
the
platoon
that
follows
watches
the
preceding
dropping
out
always
exists
but
it
is
less
extensive
with
an
open
order
the
men
running
more
risks
of
being
recognized
stragglers
will
be
fewer
as
the
companies
know
each
other
better
and
as
the
officers
and
men
are
more
dependable
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
get
the
french
infantry
to
make
use
of
its
fire
before
charging
if
it
fires
it
will
not
charge
because
it
will
continue
to
fire
bugeaud
method
of
firing
during
the
advance
is
good
what
is
needed
then
is
skirmishers
who
deliver
the
only
effective
fire
and
troops
in
formation
who
push
the
skirmishers
on
in
themselves
advancing
to
the
attack
the
soldier
wants
to
be
occupied
to
return
shot
for
shot
place
him
in
a
position
to
act
immediately
individually
then
whatever
he
does
you
have
not
wholly
lost
your
authority
over
him
again
and
again
and
again
at
drill
the
officers
and
officer
ought
to
tell
the
private
this
is
taught
you
to
serve
you
under
such
circumstances
generals
field
officers
ought
to
tell
officers
the
same
thing
this
alone
can
make
an
instructed
army
like
the
roman
army
but
who
of
us
can
explain
page
for
page
the
use
of
anything
ordered
by
our
tactical
regulations
except
the
school
of
the
skirmisher
forward
retreat
and
by
the
flank
are
the
only
practical
movements
under
fire
but
the
others
should
be
explained
explain
the
position
of
carry
arms
with
the
left
hand
explain
the
ordinary
step
explain
firing
at
command
in
the
school
of
the
battalion
it
is
well
enough
for
the
school
of
the
platoon
because
a
company
can
make
use
thereof
but
a
battalion
never
can
everything
leads
to
the
belief
that
battle
with
present
arms
will
be
in
the
same
space
of
time
more
deadly
than
with
ancient
ones
the
trajectory
of
the
projectile
reaching
further
the
rapidity
of
firing
being
four
times
as
great
more
men
will
be
put
out
of
commission
in
less
time
while
the
arm
becomes
more
deadly
man
does
not
change
his
morale
remains
capable
of
certain
efforts
and
the
demands
upon
it
become
stronger
morale
is
overtaxed
it
reaches
more
rapidly
the
maximum
of
tension
which
throws
the
soldier
to
the
front
or
rear
the
rôle
of
commanders
is
to
maintain
morale
to
direct
those
movements
which
men
instinctively
execute
when
heavily
engaged
and
under
the
pressure
of
danger
napoleon
i
said
that
in
battle
the
rôle
of
skirmishers
is
the
most
fatiguing
and
most
deadly
this
means
that
under
the
empire
as
at
present
the
strongly
engaged
infantry
troops
rapidly
dissolved
into
skirmishers
the
action
was
decided
by
the
moral
agency
of
the
troops
not
engaged
held
in
hand
capable
of
movement
in
any
direction
and
acting
as
a
great
menace
of
new
danger
to
the
adversary
already
shaken
by
the
destructive
action
of
the
skirmishers
the
same
is
true
but
the
greater
force
of
fire
arms
requires
more
than
ever
that
they
be
utilized
the
rôle
of
the
skirmisher
becomes
preëminently
the
destructive
role
it
is
forced
on
every
organization
seriously
engaged
by
the
greater
moral
pressure
of
which
causes
men
to
scatter
sooner
imagine
formed
battalions
firing
on
the
enemy
and
do
not
include
the
use
of
skirmishers
in
drill
this
is
an
error
for
they
are
necessary
in
drill
and
everywhere
etc
the
formed
rank
is
more
difficult
to
utilize
than
ever
general
leboeuf
used
a
very
practical
movement
of
going
into
battle
by
platoons
which
advance
to
the
battle
line
in
echelon
and
can
fire
even
if
they
are
taken
in
the
very
act
of
the
movement
there
is
always
the
same
dangerous
tendency
toward
mass
action
even
for
a
battalion
in
maneuver
this
is
an
error
the
principles
of
maneuver
for
small
units
should
not
be
confused
with
those
for
great
units
emperor
napoleon
did
not
prescribe
skirmishers
in
flat
country
but
every
officer
should
be
reduced
who
does
not
utilize
them
to
some
degree
the
rôle
of
the
skirmisher
becomes
more
and
more
predominant
he
should
be
so
much
the
more
watched
and
directed
as
he
is
used
against
more
deadly
arms
and
consequently
is
more
disposed
to
escape
from
all
control
from
all
direction
yet
under
such
battle
conditions
formations
are
proposed
which
send
skirmishers
six
hundred
paces
in
advance
of
battalions
and
which
give
the
battalion
commander
the
mission
of
watching
and
directing
with
six
companies
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
men
troops
spread
over
a
space
of
three
hundred
paces
by
five
hundred
at
a
minimum
to
advance
skirmishers
six
hundred
paces
from
their
battalion
and
to
expect
they
will
remain
there
is
the
work
of
people
who
have
never
observed
inasmuch
as
combat
by
skirmishers
tends
to
predominate
and
since
it
becomes
more
difficult
with
the
increase
of
danger
there
has
been
a
constant
effort
to
bring
into
the
firing
line
the
man
who
must
direct
it
leaders
have
been
seen
to
spread
an
entire
battalion
in
front
of
an
infantry
brigade
or
division
so
that
the
skirmishers
placed
under
a
single
command
might
obey
a
general
direction
better
this
method
scarcely
practicable
on
the
and
indicating
an
absolute
lack
of
practical
sense
marks
the
tendency
the
authors
of
new
drills
go
too
far
in
the
opposite
direction
they
give
the
immediate
command
of
the
skirmishers
in
each
battalion
to
the
battalion
commander
who
must
at
the
same
time
lead
his
skirmishers
and
his
battalion
this
expedient
is
more
practical
than
the
other
it
abandons
all
thought
of
an
impossible
general
control
and
places
the
special
direction
in
the
right
hands
but
the
leadership
is
too
distant
the
battalion
commander
has
to
attend
to
the
participation
of
his
battalion
in
the
line
or
in
the
ensemble
of
other
battalions
of
the
brigade
or
division
and
the
particular
performance
of
his
skirmishers
the
more
difficult
confused
the
engagement
becomes
the
more
simple
and
clear
ought
to
be
the
roles
of
each
one
skirmishers
are
in
need
of
a
firmer
hand
than
ever
to
direct
and
maintain
them
so
that
they
may
do
their
part
the
battalion
commander
must
be
entirely
occupied
with
the
rôle
of
skirmishers
or
with
the
rôle
of
the
line
there
should
be
smaller
battalions
the
number
in
reserve
as
skirmisher
battalions
in
the
latter
the
men
should
be
employed
as
skirmishers
and
held
in
reserve
the
line
of
skirmishers
will
then
gain
steadiness
let
the
battalion
commander
of
the
troops
of
the
second
line
entirely
occupy
himself
with
his
battalion
the
full
battalion
of
six
companies
is
too
unwieldy
for
one
man
have
battalions
of
four
companies
of
one
hundred
men
each
which
is
certainly
quite
sufficient
considering
the
power
of
destruction
which
these
four
companies
place
in
the
hands
of
one
man
he
will
have
difficulty
in
maintaining
and
directing
these
four
companies
under
the
operation
of
increasingly
powerful
modern
appliances
he
will
have
difficulty
in
watching
them
in
modern
combat
with
the
greater
interval
between
the
men
in
line
that
the
use
of
the
present
arms
necessitates
with
a
unified
battalion
of
six
hundred
men
i
would
do
better
against
a
battalion
of
one
thousand
prussians
than
with
a
battalion
of
eight
hundred
men
two
hundred
of
whom
are
immediately
taken
out
of
my
control
skirmishers
have
a
destructive
effect
formed
troops
a
moral
effect
drill
ground
maneuvers
should
prepare
for
actual
battle
in
such
maneuvers
why
at
the
decisive
moment
of
an
attack
should
you
lighten
the
moral
anxiety
of
the
foe
by
ceasing
his
destruction
by
calling
back
your
skirmishers
if
the
enemy
keeps
his
own
skirmishers
and
marches
resolutely
behind
them
you
are
lost
for
his
moral
action
upon
you
is
augmented
by
his
destructive
action
against
which
you
have
kindly
disarmed
yourself
why
do
you
call
back
your
skirmishers
is
it
because
your
skirmishers
hinder
the
operation
of
your
columns
block
bayonet
charges
one
must
never
have
been
in
action
to
advance
such
a
reason
at
the
last
moment
at
the
supreme
moment
when
one
or
two
hundred
meters
separate
you
from
the
adversary
there
is
no
longer
a
line
there
is
a
fearless
advance
and
your
skirmishers
are
your
forlorn
hope
let
them
charge
on
their
own
account
let
them
be
passed
or
pushed
forward
by
the
mass
do
not
recall
them
do
not
order
them
to
execute
any
maneuver
for
they
are
not
capable
of
any
except
perhaps
that
of
falling
back
and
establishing
a
which
might
drag
you
along
in
these
moments
everything
hangs
by
a
thread
is
it
because
your
skirmishers
would
prevent
you
from
delivering
fire
do
you
then
believe
in
firing
especially
in
firing
under
the
pressure
of
approaching
danger
before
the
enemy
if
he
is
wise
certainly
he
marches
preceded
by
skirmishers
who
kill
men
in
your
ranks
and
who
have
the
confidence
of
a
first
success
of
having
seen
your
skirmishers
disappear
before
them
these
skirmishers
will
certainly
lie
down
before
your
unmasked
front
in
that
formation
they
easily
cause
you
losses
and
you
are
subjected
to
their
destructive
effect
and
to
the
moral
effect
of
the
advance
of
troops
in
formation
against
you
your
ranks
become
confused
you
do
not
hold
the
position
there
is
but
one
way
of
holding
it
that
is
to
advance
and
for
that
it
is
necessary
at
all
costs
to
avoid
firing
before
moving
ahead
fire
opened
no
one
advances
further
do
you
believe
in
opening
and
ceasing
fire
at
the
will
of
the
commander
as
on
the
drill
ground
the
commencement
of
fire
by
a
battalion
with
the
present
arms
especially
is
the
beginning
of
disorder
the
moment
where
the
battalion
begins
to
escape
from
its
leader
while
drilling
even
the
battalion
commanders
after
a
little
lively
drill
after
a
march
can
no
longer
control
the
fire
do
you
object
that
no
one
ever
gets
within
two
hundred
meters
of
the
enemy
that
a
unit
attacking
from
the
front
never
succeeds
so
be
it
let
us
attack
from
the
flank
but
a
flank
is
always
more
or
less
covered
men
are
stationed
there
ready
for
the
blow
it
will
be
necessary
to
pick
off
these
men
more
than
ever
no
rapid
calm
firing
is
possible
except
skirmish
firing
the
rapidity
of
firing
has
reduced
six
ranks
to
two
ranks
with
reliable
troops
who
have
no
need
of
the
moral
support
of
a
second
rank
behind
them
one
rank
suffices
at
any
rate
it
is
possible
to
await
attack
in
two
ranks
in
prescribing
fire
at
command
in
seeking
to
minimize
the
rôle
of
skirmishers
instead
of
making
it
predominate
you
take
sides
with
the
germans
we
are
not
fitted
for
that
sort
of
game
if
they
adopt
fire
at
command
it
is
just
one
more
reason
for
our
finding
another
method
we
have
invented
discovered
the
skirmisher
he
is
forced
upon
us
by
our
men
our
arms
etc
he
must
be
organized
in
fire
by
rank
in
battle
men
gather
into
small
groups
and
become
confused
the
more
space
they
have
the
less
will
be
the
disorder
formed
in
two
ranks
each
rank
should
be
still
thinner
all
the
shots
of
the
second
line
are
lost
the
men
should
not
touch
they
should
be
far
apart
the
second
rank
in
firing
from
position
at
a
supreme
moment
ought
not
to
be
directly
behind
the
first
the
men
ought
to
be
echeloned
behind
the
first
there
will
always
be
firing
from
position
on
any
front
it
is
necessary
to
make
this
firing
as
effective
and
as
easy
as
possible
i
do
not
wish
to
challenge
the
experiences
of
the
target
range
but
i
wish
to
put
them
to
practical
use
it
is
evident
that
the
present
arms
are
more
deadly
than
the
ancient
ones
the
morale
of
the
troops
will
therefore
be
more
severely
shaken
the
influence
of
the
leader
should
be
greater
over
the
combatants
those
immediately
engaged
if
it
seems
rational
let
colonels
engage
in
action
with
the
battalions
of
their
regiment
in
two
lines
one
battalion
acts
as
skirmishers
the
other
battalion
waits
formed
ready
to
aid
the
first
if
you
do
not
wish
so
to
utilize
the
colonels
put
all
the
battalions
of
the
regiment
in
the
first
line
and
eventually
use
them
as
skirmishers
the
thing
is
inevitable
it
will
be
done
in
spite
of
you
do
it
yourself
at
the
very
first
opportunity
the
necessity
of
replenishing
the
ammunition
supply
so
quickly
used
up
by
the
infantry
requires
engaging
the
infantry
by
units
only
which
can
be
relieved
by
other
units
after
the
exhaustion
of
the
ammunition
supply
as
skirmishers
are
exhausted
quickly
engage
entire
battalions
as
skirmishers
assisted
by
entire
battalions
as
supports
or
reserves
this
is
a
necessary
measure
to
insure
good
order
do
not
throw
into
the
fight
immediately
the
four
companies
of
the
battalion
up
to
the
crucial
moment
the
battalion
commander
ought
to
guard
against
throwing
every
one
into
the
fight
there
is
a
mania
seen
in
our
maneuver
camps
for
completely
covering
a
battle
front
a
defended
position
by
skirmishers
without
the
least
interval
between
the
skirmishers
of
different
battalions
what
will
be
the
result
initially
a
waste
of
men
and
ammunition
then
difficulty
in
replacing
them
why
cover
the
front
everywhere
if
you
do
then
what
advantage
is
there
in
being
able
to
see
from
a
great
distance
leave
large
intervals
between
your
deployed
companies
we
are
no
longer
only
one
hundred
meters
from
the
enemy
at
the
time
of
firing
since
we
are
able
to
see
at
a
great
distance
we
do
not
risk
having
the
enemy
dash
into
these
intervals
unexpectedly
your
skirmisher
companies
at
large
intervals
begin
the
fight
the
killing
while
your
advance
companies
move
ahead
the
battalion
commander
follows
with
his
formed
companies
defilading
them
as
much
as
possible
he
lets
them
march
if
the
skirmishers
fight
at
the
halt
he
supervises
them
if
the
commanding
officer
wishes
to
reënforce
his
line
if
he
wants
to
face
an
enemy
who
attempts
to
advance
into
an
interval
if
he
has
any
motive
for
doing
it
in
a
word
he
rushes
new
skirmishers
into
the
interval
certainly
these
companies
have
more
of
the
forward
impulse
more
dash
if
dash
is
needed
than
the
skirmishers
already
in
action
if
they
pass
the
first
skirmishers
no
harm
is
done
there
you
have
echelons
already
formed
the
skirmishers
engaged
seeing
aid
in
front
of
them
can
be
launched
ahead
more
easily
besides
the
companies
thrown
into
this
interval
are
a
surprise
for
the
enemy
that
is
something
to
be
considered
as
is
the
fact
that
so
long
as
there
is
fighting
at
a
halt
intervals
in
the
skirmish
lines
are
fit
places
for
enemy
bullets
furthermore
these
companies
remain
in
the
hands
of
their
leaders
with
the
present
method
of
reënforcing
skirmishers
i
am
speaking
of
the
practical
method
of
the
battlefield
not
of
theory
a
company
starting
from
behind
the
skirmishers
engaged
without
a
place
in
which
to
deploy
does
not
find
anything
better
to
do
than
to
mingle
with
the
skirmishers
here
it
doubles
the
number
of
men
but
in
doing
so
brings
disorder
prevents
the
control
of
the
commanders
and
breaks
up
the
regularly
constituted
groups
while
the
closing
up
of
intervals
to
make
places
for
new
arrivals
is
good
on
the
drill
ground
or
good
before
or
after
the
combat
it
never
works
during
battle
no
prescribed
interval
will
be
kept
exactly
it
will
open
it
will
close
following
the
fluctuations
of
the
combat
but
the
onset
during
which
it
can
be
kept
is
not
the
moment
of
brisk
combat
it
is
the
moment
of
the
engagement
of
contact
consequently
of
feeling
out
it
is
essential
that
there
remain
space
in
which
to
advance
suppose
you
are
on
a
plain
for
in
a
maneuver
one
starts
from
the
flat
terrain
in
extending
the
new
company
it
will
reënforce
the
wings
of
the
others
the
men
naturally
supporting
the
flanks
of
their
comrades
the
individual
intervals
will
lessen
in
order
to
make
room
for
the
new
company
the
company
will
always
have
a
well
determined
central
group
a
rallying
point
for
the
others
if
the
interval
has
disappeared
there
is
always
time
to
employ
the
emergency
method
of
doubling
the
ranks
in
front
but
one
must
not
forget
whatever
the
course
taken
to
preserve
good
order
we
can
not
resist
closing
intervals
between
battalions
as
if
we
were
still
in
the
times
of
the
pikemen
when
indeed
it
was
possible
to
pass
through
an
interval
the
fighting
is
done
ten
times
farther
away
and
the
intervals
between
battalions
are
not
weak
joints
they
are
covered
by
the
fire
of
the
skirmishers
as
well
covered
by
fire
as
the
rest
of
the
front
and
invisible
to
the
enemy
skirmishers
and
masses
are
the
formations
for
action
of
poorly
instructed
french
troops
with
instruction
and
unity
there
would
be
skirmishers
supported
and
formation
in
battalion
columns
at
most
troops
in
close
order
can
have
only
a
moral
effect
for
the
attack
or
for
a
demonstration
if
you
want
to
produce
a
real
effect
use
musketry
for
this
it
is
necessary
to
form
a
single
line
formations
have
purely
moral
effect
whoever
counts
on
their
material
effective
action
against
reliable
cool
troops
is
mistaken
and
is
defeated
skirmishers
alone
do
damage
picked
shots
would
do
more
if
properly
employed
in
attacking
a
position
start
the
charge
at
the
latest
possible
moment
when
the
leader
thinks
he
can
reach
the
objective
not
all
out
of
breath
until
then
it
has
been
possible
to
march
in
rank
that
is
under
the
officers
the
rank
not
being
the
mathematical
line
but
the
grouping
in
the
hands
of
the
leader
under
his
eye
with
the
run
comes
confusion
many
stop
the
fewer
as
the
run
is
shorter
they
lie
down
on
the
way
and
will
rejoin
only
if
the
attack
succeeds
if
they
join
at
all
if
by
running
too
long
the
men
are
obliged
to
stop
in
order
to
breathe
and
rest
the
dash
is
broken
shattered
at
the
advance
very
few
will
start
there
are
ten
chances
to
one
of
seeing
the
attack
fail
of
turning
it
into
a
joke
with
cries
of
forward
with
fixed
bayonet
but
none
advancing
except
some
brave
men
who
will
be
killed
uselessly
the
attack
vanishes
finally
before
the
least
demonstration
of
the
foe
an
unfortunate
shout
a
mere
nothing
can
destroy
it
absolute
rules
are
foolish
the
conduct
of
every
charge
being
an
affair
requiring
tact
but
so
regulate
by
general
rules
the
conduct
of
an
infantry
charge
that
those
who
commence
it
too
far
away
can
properly
be
accused
of
panic
and
there
is
a
way
regulate
it
as
the
cavalry
charge
is
regulated
and
have
a
rearguard
in
each
battalion
of
officers
of
most
reliable
officers
in
order
to
gather
together
to
follow
close
upon
the
charge
at
a
walk
and
to
collect
all
those
who
have
lain
down
so
as
not
to
march
or
because
they
were
out
of
breath
this
rearguard
might
consist
of
a
small
platoon
of
picked
shots
such
as
we
need
in
each
battalion
the
charge
ought
to
be
made
at
a
given
distance
else
it
vanishes
evaporates
the
leader
who
commences
it
too
soon
either
has
no
head
or
does
not
want
to
gain
his
objective
the
infantry
of
the
line
as
opposed
to
elite
commands
should
not
be
kept
in
support
the
least
firm
the
most
impressionable
are
thus
sent
into
the
road
stained
with
the
blood
of
the
strongest
we
place
them
after
a
moral
anxiety
of
waiting
face
to
face
with
the
terrible
destruction
and
mutilation
of
modern
weapons
if
antiquity
had
need
of
solid
troops
as
supports
we
have
a
greater
need
of
them
death
in
ancient
combat
was
not
as
horrible
as
in
the
modern
battle
where
the
flesh
is
mangled
slashed
by
artillery
fire
in
ancient
combat
except
in
defeat
the
wounded
were
few
in
number
this
is
the
reply
to
those
who
wish
to
begin
an
action
by
chasseurs
zouaves
etc
he
general
or
mere
captain
who
employs
every
one
in
the
storming
of
a
position
can
be
sure
of
seeing
it
retaken
by
an
organized
of
four
men
and
a
corporal
in
order
that
we
may
have
real
supervision
and
responsibility
in
units
from
companies
to
brigades
the
supporting
troops
ought
to
be
of
the
same
company
the
same
battalion
the
same
brigade
as
the
case
may
be
each
brigade
ought
to
have
its
two
lines
each
battalion
its
skirmishers
etc
the
system
of
holding
out
a
reserve
as
long
as
possible
for
independent
action
when
the
enemy
has
used
his
own
ought
to
be
applied
downwards
each
battalion
should
have
its
own
each
regiment
its
own
firmly
maintained
there
is
more
need
than
ever
for
protecting
the
supporting
forces
the
reserves
the
power
of
destruction
increases
the
morale
remains
the
same
the
tests
of
morale
being
more
violent
than
previously
ought
to
be
shorter
because
the
power
of
morale
has
not
increased
the
masses
reserves
the
second
the
first
lines
should
be
protected
and
sheltered
even
more
than
the
skirmishers
squares
sometimes
are
broken
by
cavalry
which
pursues
the
skirmishers
into
the
square
instead
of
lying
down
they
rush
blindly
to
their
refuge
which
they
render
untenable
and
destroy
no
square
can
hold
out
against
determined
troops
but
the
infantry
square
is
not
a
thing
of
mechanics
of
mathematical
reasoning
it
is
a
thing
of
morale
a
platoon
in
four
ranks
two
facing
the
front
two
the
rear
its
flanks
guarded
by
the
extreme
files
that
face
to
the
flank
and
conducted
supported
by
the
officers
placed
in
a
fifth
rank
in
the
interior
of
the
rectangle
powerful
in
its
compactness
and
its
fire
can
not
be
dislodged
by
cavalry
however
this
platoon
will
prefer
to
form
a
part
of
a
large
square
it
will
consider
itself
stronger
because
of
numbers
and
indeed
it
will
be
since
the
feeling
of
force
pervades
this
whole
force
this
feeling
is
power
in
war
people
who
calculate
only
according
to
the
fire
delivered
according
to
the
destructive
power
of
infantry
would
have
it
fight
deployed
against
cavalry
they
do
not
consider
that
although
supported
and
maintained
although
such
a
formation
seem
to
prevent
flight
the
very
impetus
of
the
charge
if
led
resolutely
will
break
the
deployment
before
the
shock
arrives
it
is
clear
that
if
the
charge
is
badly
conducted
whether
the
infantry
be
solid
or
not
it
will
never
reach
its
objective
why
moral
reasons
and
no
others
make
the
soldier
in
a
square
feel
himself
stronger
than
when
in
line
he
feels
himself
watched
from
behind
and
has
nowhere
to
flee
firing
it
is
easy
to
misuse
weapons
such
as
the
rifle
the
fashion
is
to
use
small
intrenchments
covering
battalions
as
old
as
powder
such
shelter
is
an
excellent
device
on
the
condition
however
that
behind
it
a
useful
fire
can
be
delivered
look
at
these
two
ranks
crouched
under
the
cover
of
a
small
trench
follow
the
direction
of
the
shots
even
note
the
trajectory
shown
by
the
burst
of
flame
you
will
be
convinced
that
under
such
conditions
even
simple
horizontal
firing
is
a
fiction
in
a
second
there
will
be
wild
firing
on
account
of
the
noise
the
crowding
the
interference
of
the
two
ranks
next
everybody
tries
to
get
under
the
best
possible
cover
firing
it
is
essential
to
save
ammunition
to
get
all
possible
efficiency
from
the
arm
yet
the
official
adoption
of
fire
by
rank
insures
relapsing
into
useless
firing
at
random
good
shots
are
wasted
placed
where
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
fire
well
since
we
have
a
weapon
that
fires
six
times
more
rapidly
than
the
ancient
weapon
why
not
profit
by
it
to
cover
a
given
space
with
six
times
fewer
riflemen
than
formerly
riflemen
placed
at
greater
intervals
will
be
less
bewildered
will
see
more
clearly
will
be
better
watched
which
may
seem
strange
to
you
and
will
consequently
deliver
a
better
fire
than
formerly
besides
they
will
expend
six
times
less
ammunition
that
is
the
vital
point
you
must
always
have
ammunition
available
that
is
to
say
troops
which
have
not
been
engaged
reserves
must
be
held
out
this
is
hard
to
manage
perhaps
it
is
not
so
hard
to
manage
however
as
fire
by
command
what
is
the
use
of
fire
by
rank
by
command
it
is
impracticable
against
the
enemy
except
in
extraordinary
cases
any
attempt
at
supervision
of
it
is
a
joke
file
firing
the
first
rank
can
shoot
horizontally
the
only
thing
required
the
second
rank
can
fire
only
into
the
air
it
is
useless
to
fire
with
our
bulky
knapsacks
interfering
so
that
our
men
raise
the
elbow
higher
than
the
shoulder
learn
what
the
field
pack
can
be
from
the
english
prussians
austrians
etc
could
the
pack
not
be
thicker
and
less
wide
have
the
first
rank
open
let
the
second
be
checkerwise
and
let
firing
against
cavalry
be
the
only
firing
to
be
executed
in
line
one
line
will
be
better
than
two
because
it
will
not
be
hindered
by
the
one
behind
it
one
kind
of
fire
is
practicable
and
efficient
that
of
one
rank
this
is
the
fire
of
skirmishers
in
close
formation
the
king
order
of
june
reads
experience
in
war
having
proved
that
three
ranks
fire
standing
and
the
intention
of
his
majesty
being
to
prescribe
only
what
can
be
executed
in
front
of
the
enemy
he
orders
that
in
firing
the
first
man
is
never
to
put
his
knee
on
the
ground
and
that
the
three
ranks
fire
standing
at
the
same
time
this
same
order
includes
instructions
on
target
practice
etc
marshal
de
cyr
says
that
conservatively
of
the
men
who
are
wounded
in
an
affair
are
put
out
of
commission
by
the
third
rank
this
estimate
is
not
high
enough
if
it
concerns
a
unit
composed
of
recruits
like
those
who
fought
at
lützen
and
bautzen
the
marshal
mentions
the
astonishment
of
napoleon
when
he
saw
the
great
number
of
men
wounded
in
the
hand
and
forearm
this
astonishment
of
napoleon
is
singular
what
ignorance
in
his
marshals
not
to
have
explained
such
wounds
chief
surgeon
larrey
by
observation
of
the
wounds
alone
exonerated
our
soldiers
of
the
accusation
of
wounds
the
observation
would
have
been
made
sooner
had
the
wounds
heretofore
been
numerous
that
they
had
not
been
can
be
explained
only
by
the
fact
that
while
the
young
soldiers
of
kept
instinctively
close
in
ranks
up
to
that
time
the
men
must
have
spaced
themselves
instinctively
in
order
to
be
able
to
shoot
or
perhaps
in
these
young
men
might
have
been
allowed
to
fire
a
longer
time
in
order
to
distract
them
and
keep
them
in
ranks
and
not
often
allowed
to
act
as
skirmishers
for
fear
of
losing
them
whilst
formerly
the
fire
by
rank
must
have
been
much
rarer
and
fire
action
must
have
given
way
almost
entirely
to
the
use
of
skirmishers
fire
by
command
presupposes
an
impossible
coolness
had
any
troops
ever
possessed
it
they
would
have
mowed
down
battalions
as
one
mows
down
corn
stalks
yet
it
has
been
known
for
a
long
time
since
frederick
since
before
frederick
since
the
first
rifle
let
troops
get
the
range
calmly
let
them
take
aim
together
so
that
no
one
disturbs
or
hinders
the
other
have
each
one
see
clearly
then
at
a
signal
let
them
all
fire
at
once
who
is
going
to
stand
against
such
people
but
did
they
aim
in
those
days
not
so
accurately
possibly
but
they
knew
how
to
shoot
to
shoot
at
the
feet
they
knew
how
to
do
it
i
do
not
say
they
did
it
if
they
had
done
so
there
would
not
have
been
any
need
of
reminding
them
of
it
so
often
note
cromwell
favorite
saying
aim
at
their
that
of
the
officers
of
the
empire
aim
at
the
height
of
the
waist
study
of
battles
of
the
expenditure
of
bullets
show
us
no
such
immediate
terrible
results
if
such
a
means
of
destruction
was
so
easy
to
obtain
why
did
not
our
illustrious
forbears
use
it
and
recommend
it
to
us
words
of
de
security
alone
creates
calmness
under
fire
in
minor
operations
of
war
how
many
captains
are
capable
of
tranquilly
commanding
their
fire
and
maneuvering
with
calmness
here
is
a
singular
thing
you
hear
fire
by
rank
against
cavalry
seriously
recommended
in
military
lectures
yet
not
a
colonel
not
a
battalion
commander
not
a
captain
requires
this
fire
to
be
executed
in
maneuvers
it
is
always
the
soldier
who
forces
the
firing
he
is
ordered
to
shoot
almost
before
he
aims
for
fear
he
will
shoot
without
command
yet
he
ought
to
feel
that
when
he
is
aiming
his
finger
on
the
trigger
his
shot
does
not
belong
to
him
but
rather
to
the
officer
who
ought
to
be
able
to
let
him
aim
for
five
minutes
if
advisable
examining
correcting
the
positions
etc
he
ought
when
aiming
always
be
ready
to
fire
upon
the
object
designated
without
ever
knowing
when
it
will
please
his
commander
to
order
him
to
fire
fire
at
command
is
not
practicable
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
if
it
were
the
perfection
of
its
execution
would
depend
on
the
coolness
of
the
commander
and
the
obedience
of
the
soldier
the
soldier
is
the
more
easily
trained
the
austrians
had
fire
by
command
in
italy
against
cavalry
did
they
use
it
they
fired
before
the
command
an
irregular
fire
a
fire
by
file
with
defective
results
fire
by
command
is
impossible
but
why
is
firing
by
rank
at
will
impossible
illusory
under
the
fire
of
the
enemy
because
of
the
reasons
already
given
and
for
this
reason
that
closed
ranks
are
incompatible
with
on
account
of
the
wounding
caused
by
the
latter
in
ranks
in
closed
ranks
the
two
lines
touching
elbows
a
man
who
falls
throws
ten
men
into
complete
confusion
there
is
no
room
for
those
who
drop
and
however
few
fall
the
resulting
disorder
immediately
makes
of
the
two
ranks
a
series
of
small
milling
groups
if
the
troops
are
young
they
become
a
disordered
flock
before
any
demonstration
caldiero
duhesme
if
the
troops
have
some
steadiness
they
of
themselves
will
make
space
they
will
try
to
make
way
for
the
bullets
they
will
scatter
as
skirmishers
with
small
intervals
note
the
grenadier
guards
at
magenta
with
very
open
ranks
men
a
pace
apart
whoever
falls
has
room
he
is
noticed
by
a
lesser
number
he
drags
down
no
one
in
his
fall
the
moral
impression
on
his
comrades
is
less
their
courage
is
less
impaired
besides
with
rapid
fire
everywhere
spaced
ranks
with
no
man
in
front
of
another
at
least
permit
horizontal
fire
closed
ranks
permit
it
hardly
in
the
first
rank
whose
ears
are
troubled
by
the
shots
from
the
men
behind
when
a
man
has
to
fire
four
or
five
shots
a
minute
one
line
is
certainly
more
solid
than
two
because
while
the
firing
is
less
by
half
it
is
more
than
twice
as
likely
to
be
horizontal
fire
as
in
the
formation
fire
even
with
blank
cartridges
would
be
sufficient
to
prevent
a
successful
charge
with
slow
fire
two
ranks
alone
were
able
to
keep
up
a
sufficiently
continuous
fusillade
with
rapid
fire
a
single
line
delivers
more
shots
than
two
with
ancient
weapons
such
fire
therefore
suffices
as
a
fusillade
close
ranks
while
suitable
for
marching
do
not
lend
themselves
to
firing
at
the
halt
marching
a
man
likes
a
comrade
at
his
side
firing
as
if
he
felt
the
flesh
attracting
the
lead
he
prefers
being
relatively
isolated
with
space
around
him
rifles
breed
queer
ideas
generals
are
found
who
say
that
rapid
firing
will
bring
back
fire
at
command
as
if
there
ever
were
such
a
thing
they
say
it
will
bring
back
salvo
firing
thus
permitting
clear
vision
as
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
these
men
have
not
an
atom
of
common
sense
it
is
singular
to
see
a
man
like
guibert
with
practical
ideas
on
most
things
give
a
long
dissertation
to
demonstrate
that
the
officers
of
his
time
were
wrong
in
aiming
at
the
middle
of
the
body
that
is
in
firing
low
he
claims
this
is
ridiculous
to
one
who
understands
the
trajectory
of
the
rifle
these
officers
were
right
they
revived
the
recommendations
of
cromwell
because
they
knew
that
in
combat
the
soldier
naturally
fires
too
high
because
he
does
not
aim
and
because
the
shape
of
the
rifle
when
it
is
brought
to
the
shoulder
tends
to
keep
the
muzzle
higher
than
the
breech
whether
that
is
the
reason
or
something
else
the
fact
is
indisputable
it
is
said
that
in
prussian
drills
all
the
bullets
hit
the
ground
at
fifty
paces
with
the
arms
of
that
time
and
the
manner
of
fighting
results
would
have
been
magnificent
in
battle
if
the
bullets
had
struck
fifty
paces
before
the
enemy
instead
of
passing
over
his
head
yet
at
mollwitz
where
the
austrians
had
five
thousand
men
disabled
the
prussians
had
over
four
thousand
firing
with
a
horizontal
sector
if
the
muzzle
be
heavy
is
more
deadly
than
firing
with
a
vertical
sector
marches
camps
night
attacks
from
the
fact
that
infantry
ought
always
to
fight
in
thin
formation
scattered
it
does
not
follow
that
it
ought
to
be
kept
in
that
order
only
in
column
is
it
possible
to
maintain
the
battle
order
it
is
necessary
to
keep
one
men
in
hand
as
long
as
possible
because
once
engaged
they
no
longer
belong
to
you
the
disposition
in
closed
mass
is
not
a
suitable
marching
formation
even
in
a
battalion
for
a
short
distance
on
account
of
heat
the
closed
column
is
intolerable
like
an
unventilated
room
formation
with
is
better
why
air
view
etc
such
a
formation
prevents
ready
entry
of
the
column
into
battle
in
case
of
necessity
or
surprise
the
not
in
the
first
line
are
brought
up
the
arms
at
the
order
and
they
can
furnish
either
skirmishers
or
a
reserve
for
the
first
line

has
been
deployed
as
skirmishers
at
leuctra
epaminondas
diminished
by
the
depth
of
his
men
he
formed
square
phalanxes
of
fifty
men
to
a
side
he
could
have
very
well
dispensed
with
it
for
the
lacedaemonian
right
was
at
once
thrown
into
disorder
by
its
own
cavalry
which
was
placed
in
front
of
that
wing
the
superior
cavalry
of
epaminondas
overran
not
only
the
cavalry
but
the
infantry
that
was
behind
it
the
infantry
of
epaminondas
coming
in
the
wake
of
his
cavalry
finished
the
work
turning
to
the
right
the
left
of
epaminondas
then
took
in
the
flank
the
lacedaemonian
line
menaced
also
in
front
by
the
approaching
echelons
of
epaminondas
this
line
became
demoralized
and
took
to
flight
perhaps
this
fifty
by
fifty
formation
was
adopted
in
order
to
give
without
maneuver
a
front
of
fifty
capable
of
acting
in
any
direction
at
leuctra
it
simply
acted
to
the
right
and
took
the
enemy
in
the
flank
and
in
reverse
thick
woods
are
generally
passed
through
in
close
column
there
is
never
any
opening
up
with
subsequent
closing
on
the
far
side
the
resulting
formation
is
as
confused
as
a
flock
of
sheep
in
a
march
through
mountains
difficult
country
a
bugler
should
be
on
the
left
at
the
orders
of
an
intelligent
officer
who
indicates
when
the
halt
seems
necessary
for
discipline
in
the
line
the
right
responds
and
if
the
place
has
been
judged
correctly
an
orderly
formation
is
maintained
keep
in
ranks
if
one
man
steps
out
others
follow

not
permit

to
leave

without
requiring
them
to
rejoin

is
always
necessary
to
have
pack
mules
in

emergency
without
this
precaution
considerable
time
may
be
lost
in
certain
difficult
places
time
is
thus
lost
every
day
in
camp
organize
your
fatigue
parties
in
advance
send
them
out
in
formation
and
escorted
definite
and
detailed
orders
ought
to
be
given
to
the
convoy
and
the
chief
ought
to
supervise
it
which
is
rarely
the
case
it
is
a
mistake
to
furnish
mules
to
officers
and
replace
them
in
case
of
loss
or
sickness
the
officer
overloads
the
mule
and
the
government
loses
more
thereby
than
is
generally
understood
convoys
are
endless
owing
to
overloaded
mules
and
stragglers
if
furnished
money
to
buy
a
mule
the
officer
uses
it
economically
because
it
is
his
if
mules
are
individually
furnished
to
officers
instead
of
money
the
officer
will
care
for
his
beast
for
the
same
reason
but
it
is
better
to
give
money
only
and
the
officer
if
he
is
not
well
cared
for
on
the
march
has
no
claim
against
the
government
always
always
take
draconian
measures
to
prevent
pillage
from
commencing
if
it
begins
it
is
difficult
ever
to
stop
it
a
body
of
infantry
is
never
left
alone
there
is
no
reason
for
calling
officers
of
that
arm
inapt
when
battalions
although
established
in
position
are
not
absolutely
on
the
same
line
with
absolutely
equal
intervals
ten
moves
are
made
to
achieve
the
exact
alignment
which
the
instructions
on
camp
movements
prescribe
yet
designating
a
guiding
battalion
might
answer
well
enough
and
still
be
according
to
the
regulations
why
are
not
night
attacks
more
employed
at
least
on
a
grand
scale
the
great
front
which
armies
occupy
renders
their
employment
more
difficult
and
exacts
of
the
troops
an
extreme
aptitude
in
this
kind
of
surprise
tactics
found
in
the
arabs
turcos
spahis
or
absolute
reliability
there
are
some
men
whose
knowledge
of
terrain
is
wonderful
with
an
unerring
eye
for
distance
who
can
find
their
way
through
places
at
night
which
they
have
visited
only
in
the
day
time
utilizing
such
material
for
a
system
of
guides
it
would
be
possible
to
move
with
certainty
these
are
simple
means
rarely
employed
for
conducting
a
body
of
troops
into
position
on
the
darkest
night
there
is
even
a
means
of
assuring
at
night
the
fire
of
a
gun
upon
a
given
point

as
much
precision

cavalry
cavalry
and
modern
appliances
they
say
that
cavalry
is
obsolete
that
it
can
be
of
no
use
in
battles
waged
with
the
weapons
of
today
is
not
infantry
affected
in
the
same
way
examples
drawn
from
the
last
two
wars
are
not
conclusive
in
a
siege
in
a
country
which
is
cut
off
one
does
not
dare
to
commit
the
cavalry
and
therefore
takes
from
it
its
boldness
which
is
almost
its
only
weapon
the
utility
of
cavalry
has
always
been
doubted
that
is
because
its
cost
is
high
it
is
little
used
just
because
it
does
cost
the
question
of
economy
is
vital
in
peace
times
when
we
set
a
high
value
upon
certain
men
they
are
not
slow
to
follow
suit
and
to
guard
themselves
against
being
broken
look
at
staff
officers
who
are
almost
never
broken
reduced
even
when
their
general
himself
is
with
new
weapons
the
rôle
of
cavalry
has
certainly
changed
less
than
any
other
although
it
is
the
one
which
is
most
worried
about
however
cavalry
always
has
the
same
doctrine
charge
to
start
with
cavalry
action
against
cavalry
is
always
the
same
also
against
infantry
cavalry
knows
well
enough
today
as
it
has
always
known
that
it
can
act
only
against
infantry
which
has
been
broken
we
must
leave
aside
epic
legends
that
are
always
false
whether
they
relate
to
cavalry
or
infantry
infantry
can
not
say
as
much
of
its
own
action
against
infantry
in
this
respect
there
is
a
complete
anarchy
of
ideas
there
is
no
infantry
doctrine
with
the
power
of
modern
weapons
which
forces
you
to
slow
down
if
it
does
not
stop
you
the
advance
under
fire
becomes
almost
impossible
the
advantage
is
with
the
defensive
this
is
so
evident
that
only
a
madman
could
dispute
it
what
then
is
to
be
done
halt
to
shoot
at
random
and
cannonade
at
long
range
until
ammunition
is
exhausted
perhaps
but
what
is
sure
is
that
such
a
state
of
affairs
makes
maneuver
necessary
there
is
more
need
than
ever
for
maneuver
at
a
long
distance
in
an
attempt
to
force
the
enemy
to
shift
to
quit
his
position
what
maneuver
is
swifter
than
that
of
cavalry
therein
is
its
role
the
extreme
perfection
of
weapons
permits
only
individual
action
in
combat
that
is
action
by
scattered
forces
at
the
same
time
it
permits
the
effective
employment
of
mass
action
out
of
range
of
maneuvers
on
the
flank
or
in
the
rear
of
the
enemy
in
force
imposing
enough
to
frighten
him
can
the
cavalry
maneuver
on
the
battle
field
why
not
it
can
maneuver
rapidly
and
above
all
beyond
the
range
of
infantry
fire
if
not
of
artillery
fire
maneuver
being
a
threat
of
great
moral
effect
the
cavalry
general
who
knows
how
to
use
it
can
contribute
largely
to
success
he
arrests
the
enemy
in
movement
doubtful
as
to
what
the
cavalry
is
going
to
attempt
he
makes
the
enemy
take
some
formation
that
keeps
him
under
artillery
fire
for
a
while
above
all
that
of
light
artillery
if
the
general
knows
how
to
use
it
he
increases
the
enemy
demoralization
and
thus
is
able
to
rejoin
his
command
rifled
cannon
and
accurate
rifles
do
not
change
cavalry
tactics
at
all
these
weapons
of
precision
as
the
word
precision
indicates
are
effective
only
when
all
battle
conditions
all
conditions
of
aiming
are
ideal
if
the
necessary
condition
of
suitable
range
is
lacking
effect
is
lacking
accuracy
of
fire
at
a
distance
is
impossible
against
a
troop
in
movement
and
movement
is
the
essence
of
cavalry
action
rifled
weapons
fire
on
them
of
course
but
they
fire
on
everybody
in
short
cavalry
is
in
the
same
situation
as
anybody
else
what
response
is
there
to
this
argument
since
weapons
have
been
improved
does
not
the
infantryman
have
to
march
under
fire
to
attack
a
position
is
the
cavalryman
not
of
the
same
flesh
has
he
less
heart
than
the
infantryman
if
one
can
march
under
fire
can
not
the
other
gallop
under
it
when
the
cavalryman
can
not
gallop
under
fire
the
infantryman
can
not
march
under
it
battles
will
consist
of
exchanges
of
rifle
shots
by
concealed
men
at
long
range
the
battle
will
end
only
when
the
ammunition
is
exhausted
the
cavalryman
gallops
through
danger
the
infantryman
walks
that
is
why
if
he
learns
as
it
is
probable
he
will
to
keep
at
the
proper
distance
the
cavalryman
will
never
see
his
battle
rôle
diminished
by
the
perfection
of
long
range
fire
an
infantryman
will
never
succeed
by
himself
the
cavalryman
will
threaten
create
diversions
worry
scatter
the
enemy
fire
often
even
get
to
close
quarters
if
he
is
properly
supported
the
infantryman
will
act
as
usual
but
more
than
ever
will
he
need
the
aid
of
cavalry
in
the
attack
he
who
knows
how
to
use
his
cavalry
with
audacity
will
inevitably
be
the
victor
even
though
the
cavalryman
offers
a
larger
target
long
range
weapons
will
paralyze
him
no
more
than
another
the
most
probable
effect
of
artillery
of
today
will
be
to
increase
the
scattering
in
the
infantry
and
even
in
the
cavalry
the
latter
can
start
in
skirmisher
formation
at
a
distance
and
close
in
while
advancing
near
its
objective
it
will
be
more
difficult
to
lead
but
this
is
to
the
advantage
of
the
frenchman
the
result
of
improving
the
ballistics
of
the
weapon
for
the
cavalry
as
for
the
infantry
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
be
otherwise
for
the
cavalry
will
be
that
a
man
will
flee
at
a
greater
distance
from
it
and
nothing
more
since
the
empire
the
opinion
of
european
armies
is
that
the
cavalry
has
not
given
the
results
expected
of
it
it
has
not
given
great
results
for
the
reason
that
we
and
others
lacked
real
cavalry
generals
he
is
it
seems
a
phenomenon
that
is
produced
only
every
thousand
years
more
rarely
than
a
real
general
of
infantry
to
be
a
good
general
whether
of
infantry
or
cavalry
is
an
infinitely
rare
thing
like
the
good
in
everything
the
profession
of
a
good
infantry
general
is
as
difficult
as
perhaps
more
difficult
than
that
of
a
good
cavalry
general
both
require
calmness
it
comes
more
easily
to
the
cavalryman
than
to
the
foot
soldier
who
is
much
more
engaged
both
require
a
like
precision
a
judgment
of
the
moral
and
physical
forces
of
the
soldier
and
the
morale
of
the
infantryman
his
constitution
is
more
tried
than
is
the
case
with
the
horseman
the
cavalry
general
of
necessity
sees
less
clearly
his
vision
has
its
limits
great
cavalry
generals
are
rare
doubtless
seidlitz
could
not
in
the
face
of
the
development
of
cannon
and
rifle
repeat
his
wonders
but
there
is
always
room
for
improvement
i
believe
there
is
much
room
for
improvement
we
did
not
have
under
the
empire
a
great
cavalry
general
who
knew
how
to
handle
masses
the
cavalry
was
used
like
a
blind
hammer
that
strikes
heavily
and
not
always
accurately
it
had
immense
losses
like
the
gauls
we
have
a
little
too
much
confidence
in
the
forward
forward
not
so
many
methods
methods
do
not
hinder
the
forward
movement
they
prepare
the
effect
and
render
it
surer
and
at
the
same
time
less
costly
to
the
assailant
we
have
all
the
gallic
brutality
note
marignano
where
the
force
of
artillery
and
the
possibility
of
a
turning
movement
around
a
village
was
neglected
what
rare
things
infantry
and
cavalry
generals
are
a
leader
must
combine
resolute
bravery
and
impetuosity
with
prudence
and
calmness
a
difficult
matter
the
broken
terrain
of
european
fields
no
longer
permits
we
are
told
the
operation
of
long
lines
of
great
masses
of
cavalry
i
do
not
regret
it
i
am
struck
more
with
the
picturesque
effect
of
these
hurricanes
of
cavalry
in
the
accounts
of
the
empire
than
with
the
results
obtained
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
these
results
were
in
proportion
to
the
apparent
force
of
the
effort
and
to
the
real
grandeur
of
the
sacrifices
and
indeed
these
enormous
hammers
a
usual
figure
are
hard
to
handle
they
have
not
the
sure
direction
of
a
weapon
well
in
hand
if
the
blow
is
not
true
recovery
is
impossible
etc
however
the
terrain
does
not
permit
the
assembling
of
cavalry
in
great
masses
this
compelling
reason
for
new
methods
renders
any
other
reason
superfluous
nevertheless
the
other
reasons
given
in
the
ministerial
observations
of
on
the
cavalry
service
seems
to
me
excellent
the
improvement
of
appliances
the
extension
of
battle
fields
the
confidence
to
the
infantry
and
the
audacity
to
the
artillery
that
the
immediate
support
of
the
cavalry
gives
demand
that
this
arm
be
in
every
division
in
sufficient
force
for
efficient
action
i
therefore
think
it
desirable
for
a
cavalry
regiment
to
be
at
the
disposal
of
a
general
commanding
a
division
whatever
the
experiences
of
instruction
centers
they
can
not
change
in
the
least
my
conviction
of
the
merit
of
this
measure
in
the
field
cavalry
against
cavalry
cavalry
action
more
than
that
of
infantry
is
an
affair
of
morale
let
us
study
first
the
morale
of
the
cavalry
engagement
in
single
combat
two
riders
rush
at
each
other
are
they
going
to
direct
their
horses
front
against
front
their
horses
would
collide
both
would
be
forced
to
their
feet
while
running
the
chance
of
being
crushed
in
the
clash
or
in
the
fall
of
their
mounts
each
one
in
the
combat
counts
on
his
strength
on
his
skill
on
the
suppleness
of
his
mount
on
his
personal
courage
he
does
not
want
a
blind
encounter
and
he
is
right
they
halt
face
to
face
abreast
to
fight
man
to
man
or
each
passes
the
other
thrusting
with
the
sabre
or
lance
or
each
tries
to
wound
the
knee
of
the
adversary
and
dismount
him
in
this
way
but
as
each
is
trying
to
strike
the
other
he
thinks
of
keeping
out
of
the
way
himself
he
does
not
want
a
blind
encounter
that
does
away
with
the
combat
the
ancient
battles
the
cavalry
engagements
the
rare
cavalry
combats
of
our
days
show
us
nothing
else
discipline
while
keeping
the
cavalrymen
in
the
ranks
has
not
been
able
to
change
the
instinct
of
the
rider
no
more
than
the
isolated
man
is
the
rider
in
the
line
willing
to
meet
the
shock
of
a
clash
with
the
enemy
there
is
a
terrible
moral
effect
in
a
mass
moving
forward
if
there
is
no
way
to
escape
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
men
and
horses
will
avoid
the
clash
by
stopping
face
to
face
but
only
preëminently
brave
troops
equally
seasoned
in
morale
alike
well
led
and
swept
along
animated
alike
will
meet
face
to
face
all
these
conditions
are
never
found
united
on
either
side
so
the
thing
is
never
seen
times
out
of
fifty
one
of
the
cavalry
forces
will
hesitate
bolt
get
into
disorder
flee
before
the
fixed
purpose
of
the
other
three
quarters
of
the
time
this
will
happen
at
a
distance
before
they
can
see
each
other
eyes
often
they
will
get
closer
but
always
always
the
stop
the
backward
movement
the
swerving
of
horses
the
confusion
bring
about
fear
or
hesitation
they
lessen
the
shock
and
turn
it
into
instant
flight
the
resolute
assailant
does
not
have
to
slacken
he
has
not
been
able
to
overcome
or
turn
the
obstacles
of
horses
not
yet
in
flight
in
this
uproar
of
an
impossible
about
face
executed
by
routed
troops
without
being
in
disorder
himself
but
this
disorder
is
that
of
victory
of
the
advance
and
a
good
cavalry
does
not
trouble
itself
about
it
it
rallies
in
advancing
while
the
vanquished
one
has
fear
at
its
heels
on
the
whole
there
are
few
losses
the
engagement
if
there
is
one
is
an
affair
of
a
second
the
proof
is
that
in
this
action
of
cavalry
against
cavalry
the
conquered
alone
loses
men
and
he
loses
generally
few
the
battle
against
infantry
is
alone
the
really
deadly
struggle
like
numbers
of
little
chasseurs
have
routed
heavy
cuirassiers
how
could
they
have
done
so
if
the
others
had
not
given
way
before
their
determination
the
essential
factor
was
and
always
is
determination
the
cavalry
casualties
are
always
much
less
than
those
of
the
infantry
both
from
fire
and
from
disease
is
it
because
the
cavalry
is
the
aristocratic
arm
this
explains
why
in
long
wars
it
improves
much
more
than
the
infantry
as
there
are
few
losses
between
cavalry
and
cavalry
so
there
is
little
fighting
hannibal
numidians
like
the
russian
cossacks
inspired
a
veritable
terror
by
the
incessant
alarms
they
caused
they
tired
out
without
fighting
and
killed
by
surprise
why
is
the
cavalry
handled
so
badly
it
is
true
that
infantry
is
not
used
because
its
rôle
is
one
of
movement
of
morale
of
morale
and
movement
so
united
that
movement
alone
often
without
a
charge
or
shock
action
of
any
sort
can
drive
the
enemy
into
retreat
and
if
followed
closely
into
rout
that
is
a
result
of
the
quickness
of
cavalry
one
who
knows
how
to
make
use
of
this
quickness
alone
can
obtain
such
results
all
writers
on
cavalry
will
tell
you
that
the
charge
pushed
home
of
two
cavalry
bodies
and
the
shock
at
top
speed
do
not
exist
always
before
the
encounter
the
weaker
runs
away
if
there
is
not
a
face
to
face
check
what
becomes
then
of
the
mv
squared
if
this
famous
mv
squared
is
an
empty
word
why
then
crush
your
horses
under
giants
forgetting
that
in
the
formula
besides
m
there
is
v
squared
in
a
charge
there
is
m
there
is
v
squared
there
is
this
and
that
there
is
resolution
and
i
believe
nothing
else
that
counts
cohesion
and
unity
give
force
to
the
charge
alignment
is
impossible
at
a
fast
gait
where
the
most
rapid
pass
the
others
only
when
the
moral
effect
has
been
produced
should
the
gait
be
increased
to
take
advantage
of
it
by
falling
upon
an
enemy
already
in
disorder
in
the
act
of
fleeing
the
cuirassiers
charge
at
a
trot
this
calm
steadiness
frightens
the
enemy
into
an
about
face
then
they
charge
at
his
back
at
a
gallop
they
say
that
at
eckmühl
for
every
french
cuirassier
down
fourteen
austrians
were
struck
in
the
back
was
it
because
they
had
no
it
is
evident
that
it
was
because
they
offered
their
backs
to
the
blows
jomini
speaks
of
charges
at
a
trot
against
cavalry
at
a
gallop
he
cites
lasalle
who
used
the
trot
and
who
seeing
cavalry
approach
at
a
gallop
would
say
there
are
lost
men
jomini
insists
on
the
effect
of
shock
the
trot
permits
that
compactness
which
the
gallop
breaks
up
that
may
be
true
but
the
effect
is
moral
above
all
a
troop
at
the
gallop
sees
a
massed
squadron
coming
towards
it
at
a
trot
it
is
surprised
at
first
at
such
coolness
the
material
impulse
of
the
gallop
is
superior
but
there
are
no
intervals
no
gaps
through
which
to
penetrate
the
line
in
order
to
avoid
the
shock
the
shock
that
overcomes
men
and
horses
these
men
must
be
very
resolute
as
their
close
ranks
do
not
permit
them
to
escape
by
about
facing
if
they
move
at
such
a
steady
gait
it
is
because
their
resolution
is
also
firm
and
they
do
not
feel
the
need
of
running
away
of
diverting
themselves
by
the
unchecked
speed
of
the
unrestrained
gallop
etc
galloping
men
do
not
reason
these
things
out
but
they
know
them
instinctively
they
understand
that
they
have
before
them
a
moral
impulse
superior
to
theirs
they
become
uneasy
hesitate
their
hands
instinctively
turn
their
horses
aside
there
is
no
longer
freedom
in
the
attack
at
a
gallop
some
go
on
to
the
end
but
have
already
tried
to
avoid
the
shock
there
is
complete
disorder
demoralization
flight
then
begins
the
pursuit
at
a
gallop
by
the
men
who
attacked
at
the
trot
the
charge
at
a
trot
exacts
of
leaders
and
men
complete
confidence
and
steadfastness
it
is
the
experience
of
battle
only
that
can
give
this
temper
to
all
but
this
charge
depending
on
a
moral
effect
will
not
always
succeed
it
is
a
question
of
surprise
xenophon
recommended
in
his
work
on
cavalry
operations
the
use
of
surprise
the
use
of
the
gallop
when
the
trot
is
customary
and
because
he
says
agreeable
or
terrible
the
less
a
thing
is
foreseen
the
more
pleasure
or
fright
does
it
cause
this
is
nowhere
seen
better
than
in
war
where
every
surprise
strikes
terror
even
to
the
strongest
as
a
general
rule
the
gallop
is
and
should
be
necessary
in
the
charge
it
is
the
winning
intoxicating
gait
for
men
and
horses
it
is
taken
up
at
such
a
distance
as
may
be
necessary
to
insure
its
success
whatever
it
may
cost
in
men
and
horses
the
regulations
are
correct
in
prescribing
that
the
charge
be
started
close
up
if
the
troopers
waited
until
the
charge
was
ordered
they
would
always
succeed
i
say
that
strong
men
moved
by
pride
or
fear
by
taking
up
too
soon
the
charge
against
a
firm
enemy
have
caused
more
charges
to
fail
than
to
succeed
keeping
men
in
hand
until
the
command
charge
seizing
the
precise
instant
for
this
command
are
both
difficult
they
exact
of
the
energetic
leader
domination
over
his
men
and
a
keen
eye
at
a
moment
when
three
out
of
four
men
no
longer
see
anything
so
that
good
cavalry
leaders
squadron
leaders
in
general
are
very
rare
real
charges
are
just
as
rare
actual
shock
no
longer
exists
the
moral
impulse
of
one
of
the
adversaries
nearly
always
upsets
the
other
perhaps
far
off
perhaps
a
little
nearer
were
this
a
little
nearer
face
to
face
one
of
the
two
troops
would
be
already
defeated
before
the
first
saber
cut
and
would
disentangle
itself
for
flight
with
actual
shock
all
would
be
thrown
into
confusion
a
real
charge
on
the
one
part
or
the
other
would
cause
mutual
extermination
in
practice
the
victor
scarcely
loses
any
one
observation
demonstrates
that
cavalry
does
not
close
with
cavalry
its
deadly
combats
are
those
against
infantry
alone
even
if
a
cavalryman
waits
without
flinching
his
horse
will
wish
to
escape
to
shrink
before
the
collision
if
man
anticipates
so
does
the
horse
why
did
frederick
like
to
see
his
center
closed
in
for
the
assault
as
the
best
guarantee
against
the
instincts
of
man
and
horse
the
cavalry
of
frederick
had
ordinarily
only
insignificant
losses
a
result
of
determination
the
men
want
to
be
distracted
from
the
advancing
danger
by
movement
the
cavalrymen
who
go
at
the
enemy
if
left
to
themselves
would
start
at
a
gallop
for
fear
of
not
arriving
or
of
arriving
exhausted
and
material
for
carnage
the
same
is
true
of
the
arabs
note
what
happened
in
to
the
cavalry
of
general
martineau
the
rapid
move
relieves
anxiety
it
is
natural
to
wish
to
lessen
it
but
the
leaders
are
there
whom
experience
whom
regulations
order
to
go
slowly
then
to
accelerate
progressively
so
as
to
arrive
with
the
maximum
of
speed
the
procedure
should
be
the
walk
then
the
trot
after
that
the
gallop
then
the
charge
but
it
takes
a
trained
eye
to
estimate
distance
and
the
character
of
the
terrain
and
if
the
enemy
approaches
to
pick
the
point
where
one
should
meet
him
the
nearer
one
approaches
the
greater
among
the
troops
is
the
question
of
morale
the
necessity
of
arriving
at
the
greatest
speed
is
not
alone
a
mechanical
question
since
indeed
one
never
clashes
it
is
a
moral
necessity
it
is
necessary
to
seize
the
moment
at
which
the
uneasiness
of
one
men
requires
the
intoxication
of
the
headlong
charging
gallop
an
instant
too
late
and
a
too
great
anxiety
has
taken
the
upper
hand
and
caused
the
hands
of
the
riders
to
act
on
the
horses
the
start
is
not
free
a
number
hide
by
remaining
behind
an
instant
too
soon
before
arrival
the
speed
has
slowed
down
the
animation
the
intoxication
of
the
run
fleeting
things
are
exhausted
anxiety
takes
the
upper
hand
again
the
hands
act
instinctively
and
even
if
the
start
were
unhampered
the
arrival
is
not
frederick
and
seidlitz
were
content
when
they
saw
the
center
of
the
charging
squadron
three
and
four
ranks
deep
it
was
as
if
they
understood
that
with
this
compact
center
as
the
first
lines
could
not
escape
to
the
right
or
left
they
were
forced
to
continue
straight
ahead
in
order
to
rush
like
even
against
infantry
men
and
horses
ought
to
be
watered
and
fresh
ponsomby
cavalry
at
waterloo
if
there
is
ever
contact
between
cavalry
the
shock
is
so
weakened
by
the
hands
of
the
men
the
rearing
of
the
horses
the
swinging
of
heads
that
both
sides
come
to
a
halt
only
the
necessity
for
carrying
along
the
man
and
the
horse
at
the
supreme
moment
for
distracting
them
necessitates
the
full
gallop
before
attacking
the
enemy
before
having
put
him
to
flight
charges
at
the
gallop
of
three
or
four
kilometers
suppose
horses
of
bronze
because
morale
is
not
studied
and
because
historical
accounts
are
taken
too
literally
each
epoch
complains
that
cavalry
forces
are
no
longer
seen
charging
and
fighting
with
the
sword
that
too
much
prudence
dictates
running
away
instead
of
clashing
with
the
enemy
these
plaints
have
been
made
ever
since
the
empire
both
by
the
allies
and
by
us
but
this
has
always
been
true
man
was
never
invulnerable
the
charging
gait
has
almost
always
been
the
trot
man
does
not
change
even
the
combats
of
cavalry
against
cavalry
today
are
deadlier
than
they
were
in
the
lamented
days
of
chivalry
the
retreat
of
the
infantry
is
always
more
difficult
than
that
of
the
cavalry
the
latter
is
simple
a
cavalry
repulsed
and
coming
back
in
disorder
is
a
foreseen
an
ordinary
happening
it
is
going
to
rally
at
a
distance
it
often
reappears
with
advantage
one
can
almost
say
in
view
of
experience
that
such
is
its
rôle
an
infantry
that
is
repelled
especially
if
the
action
has
been
a
hot
one
and
the
cavalry
rushes
in
is
often
disorganized
for
the
rest
of
the
day
even
authors
who
tell
you
that
two
squadrons
never
collide
tell
you
continually
the
force
of
cavalry
is
in
the
shock
in
the
terror
of
the
shock
yes
in
the
shock
no
it
lies
only
in
determination
it
is
a
mental
and
not
a
mechanical
condition
never
give
officers
and
men
of
the
cavalry
mathematical
demonstrations
of
the
charge
they
are
good
only
to
shake
confidence
mathematical
reasoning
shows
a
mutual
collapse
that
never
takes
place
show
them
the
truth
lasalle
with
his
always
victorious
charge
at
a
trot
guarded
against
similar
reasonings
which
might
have
demonstrated
to
him
mathematically
that
a
charge
of
cuirassiers
at
a
trot
ought
to
be
routed
by
a
charge
of
hussars
at
a
gallop
he
simply
told
them
go
resolutely
and
be
sure
that
you
will
never
find
a
daredevil
determined
enough
to
come
to
grips
with
you
it
is
necessary
to
be
a
daredevil
in
order
to
go
to
the
end
the
frenchman
is
one
above
all
because
he
is
a
good
trooper
in
battle
when
his
commanders
themselves
are
daredevils
he
is
the
best
in
europe
note
the
days
of
the
empire
the
remarks
of
wellington
a
good
judge
if
moreover
his
leaders
use
a
little
head
work
that
never
harms
anything
the
formula
of
the
cavalry
is
r
resolution
and
r
and
always
r
and
r
is
greater
than
all
the
mv
squared
in
the
world
there
is
this
important
element
in
the
pursuit
of
cavalry
by
cavalry
the
pursued
can
not
halt
without
delivering
himself
up
to
the
pursuer
the
pursuer
can
always
see
the
pursued
if
the
latter
halts
and
starts
to
face
about
the
pursuer
can
fall
upon
him
before
he
is
faced
and
take
him
by
surprise
but
the
pursued
does
not
know
how
many
are
pursuing
him
if
he
alone
halts
two
pursuers
may
rush
on
him
for
they
see
ahead
of
them
and
they
naturally
attack
whoever
tries
to
face
about
for
with
the
about
face
danger
again
confronts
them
the
pursuit
is
often
instigated
by
the
fear
that
the
enemy
will
turn
the
material
fact
that
once
in
flight
all
together
can
not
turn
again
without
risking
being
surprised
and
overthrown
makes
the
flight
continuous
even
the
bravest
flee
until
sufficient
distance
between
them
and
the
enemy
or
some
other
circumstances
such
as
cover
or
supporting
troops
permits
of
a
rally
and
a
return
to
the
offensive
in
this
case
the
pursuit
may
turn
into
flight
in
its
turn
cavalry
is
insistent
on
attacking
on
an
equal
front
because
if
with
a
broader
front
the
enemy
gives
way
before
it
his
wings
may
attack
it
and
make
it
the
pursued
instead
of
the
pursuer
the
moral
effect
of
resolution
is
so
great
that
cavalry
breaking
and
pursuing
a
more
numerous
cavalry
is
never
pursued
by
the
enemy
wings
however
the
idea
that
one
may
be
taken
in
rear
by
forces
whom
one
has
left
on
the
flanks
in
a
position
to
do
so
has
such
an
effect
that
the
resolution
necessary
for
an
attack
under
these
circumstances
is
rare
why
is
it
that
colonel
a
does
not
want
a
depth
formation
for
cavalry
he
who
believes
in
pressure
of
the
rear
ranks
on
the
first
it
is
because
at
heart
he
is
convinced
that
only
the
first
rank
can
act
in
a
cavalry
charge
and
that
this
rank
can
receive
no
impression
no
speeding
up
from
those
behind
it
there
is
debate
as
to
the
advantage
of
one
or
two
ranks
for
the
cavalry
this
again
is
a
matter
of
morale
leave
liberty
of
choice
and
under
varying
conditions
of
confidence
and
morale
one
or
the
other
will
be
adopted
there
are
enough
officers
for
either
formation
it
is
characteristic
of
cavalry
to
advance
further
than
infantry
and
consequently
it
exposes
its
flanks
more
it
then
needs
more
reserves
to
cover
its
flanks
and
rear
than
does
infantry
it
needs
reserves
to
protect
and
to
support
the
pursuers
who
are
almost
always
pursued
when
they
return
with
cavalry
even
more
than
infantry
victory
belongs
to
the
last
reserves
held
intact
the
one
with
the
reserves
is
always
the
one
who
can
take
the
offensive
tie
to
that
and
no
one
can
stand
before
you
with
room
to
maneuver
cavalry
rallies
quickly
in
deep
columns
it
can
not
the
engagement
of
cavalry
lasts
only
a
moment
it
must
be
reformed
immediately
with
a
roll
call
at
each
reforming
it
gets
out
of
hand
less
than
the
infantry
which
once
engaged
has
little
respite
there
should
be
a
roll
call
for
cavalry
and
for
infantry
after
an
advance
at
each
lull
there
should
be
roll
calls
at
drill
and
in
field
maneuvers
not
that
they
are
necessary
but
in
order
to
become
habituated
to
them
then
the
roll
call
will
not
be
forgotten
on
the
day
of
action
when
very
few
think
of
what
ought
to
be
done
in
the
confusion
and
speed
of
cavalry
action
man
escapes
more
easily
from
surveillance
in
our
battles
his
action
is
increasingly
individual
and
rapid
the
cavalryman
should
not
be
left
too
free
that
would
be
dangerous
frequently
in
action
troops
should
be
reformed
and
the
roll
called
it
would
be
an
error
not
to
do
so
there
might
be
ten
to
twenty
roll
calls
in
a
day
the
officers
the
soldiers
would
then
have
a
chance
to
demand
an
accounting
from
each
man
and
might
demand
it
the
next
day
once
in
action
and
that
action
lasts
the
infantryman
of
today
escapes
from
the
control
of
his
officers
this
is
due
to
the
disorder
inherent
in
battle
to
deployment
to
the
absence
of
roll
calls
which
can
not
be
held
in
action
control
then
can
only
be
in
the
hands
of
his
comrades
of
modern
arms
infantry
is
the
one
in
which
there
is
the
greatest
need
for
cohesion
cavalry
always
fights
very
poorly
and
very
little
this
has
been
true
from
antiquity
when
the
cavalryman
was
of
a
superior
caste
to
the
infantryman
and
ought
to
have
been
braver
anybody
advancing
cavalry
or
infantry
ought
to
scout
and
reconnoiter
as
soon
as
possible
the
terrain
on
which
it
acts
condé
forgot
this
at
neerwinden
the
forgot
it
at
solferino
everybody
forgets
it
and
from
the
failure
to
use
skirmishers
and
scouts
come
mistakes
and
disasters
the
cavalry
has
a
rifle
for
exceptional
use
look
out
that
this
exception
does
not
become
the
rule
such
a
tendency
has
been
seen
at
the
battle
of
sicka
the
first
clash
was
marred
by
the
lack
of
dash
on
the
part
of
a
regiment
of
chasseurs
which
after
being
sent
off
at
the
gallop
halted
to
shoot
at
the
second
clash
general
bugeaud
charged
at
their
head
to
show
them
how
to
charge
a
young
colonel
of
light
cavalry
asked
carbines
for
his
cavalry
why
so
that
if
i
want
to
reconnoiter
a
village
i
can
sound
it
from
a
distance
of
seven
or
eight
hundred
meters
without
losing
anybody
what
can
you
say
to
a
man
advancing
such
ideas
certainly
the
carbine
makes
everybody
lose
common
sense
the
work
of
light
cavalry
makes
it
inevitable
that
they
be
captured
sometimes
it
is
impossible
to
get
news
of
the
enemy
without
approaching
him
if
one
man
escapes
in
a
patrol
that
is
enough
if
no
one
comes
back
even
that
fact
is
instructive
the
cavalry
is
a
priceless
object
that
no
leader
wants
to
break
however
it
is
only
by
breaking
it
that
results
can
be
obtained
some
authors
think
of
using
cavalry
as
skirmishers
mounted
or
dismounted
i
suppose
they
advance
holding
the
horse
by
the
bridle
this
appears
to
be
to
be
an
absurdity
if
the
cavalryman
fires
he
will
not
charge
the
african
incident
cited
proves
that
it
would
be
better
to
give
the
cavalryman
two
pistols
than
a
carbine
the
americans
in
their
vast
country
where
there
is
unlimited
room
used
cavalry
wisely
in
sending
it
off
on
distant
forays
to
cut
communications
make
levies
etc
what
their
cavalry
did
as
an
arm
in
battle
is
unknown
the
cavalry
raids
in
the
american
war
were
part
of
a
war
directed
against
wealth
against
public
works
against
resources
it
was
war
of
destruction
of
riches
not
of
men
the
raiding
cavalry
had
few
losses
and
inflicted
few
losses
the
cavalry
is
always
the
aristocratic
arm
which
loses
very
lightly
even
if
it
risks
all
at
least
it
has
the
air
of
risking
all
which
is
something
at
any
rate
it
has
to
have
daring
and
daring
is
not
so
common
but
the
merest
infantry
engagements
in
equal
numbers
costs
more
than
the
most
brilliant
cavalry
raid
cavalry
against
infantry
cavalry
knows
how
to
fight
cavalry
but
how
it
fights
infantry
not
one
cavalry
officer
in
a
thousand
knows
perhaps
not
one
of
them
knows
go
to
it
then
gaily
with
general
uncertainty
a
military
man
a
participant
in
our
great
wars
recommends
as
infallible
against
infantry
in
line
the
charge
from
the
flank
horse
following
horse
he
would
have
cavalry
coming
up
on
the
enemy
left
pass
along
his
front
and
change
direction
so
as
to
use
its
arms
to
the
right
this
cavalryman
is
right
such
charges
should
give
excellent
results
the
only
deadly
results
the
cavalryman
can
only
strike
to
his
right
and
in
this
way
each
one
strikes
against
ancient
infantry
such
charges
would
have
been
as
valuable
as
against
modern
infantry
this
officer
saw
with
his
own
eyes
excellent
examples
of
this
attack
in
the
wars
of
the
empire
i
do
not
doubt
either
the
facts
he
cites
or
the
deductions
he
makes
but
for
such
charges
there
must
be
officers
who
inspire
absolute
confidence
in
their
men
and
dependable
and
experienced
soldiers
there
is
necessary
in
short
an
excellent
cavalry
seasoned
by
long
wars
and
officers
and
men
of
very
firm
resolution
so
it
is
not
astonishing
that
examples
of
this
mode
of
action
are
rare
they
always
will
be
they
always
require
a
head
for
the
charge
an
isolated
head
and
when
he
is
actually
about
to
strike
he
will
fall
back
into
the
formation
it
seems
to
him
that
lost
in
the
mass
he
risks
less
than
when
alone
everybody
is
willing
to
charge
but
only
if
all
charge
together
it
is
a
case
of
belling
the
cat
the
attack
in
column
on
infantry
has
a
greater
moral
action
than
the
charge
in
line
if
the
first
and
second
squadrons
are
repulsed
but
the
infantry
sees
a
third
charging
through
the
dust
it
will
say
when
is
this
going
to
stop
and
it
will
be
shaken
an
extract
from
folard
only
a
capable
officer
is
needed
to
get
the
best
results
from
a
cavalry
which
has
confidence
in
its
movement
which
is
known
to
be
good
and
vigorous
and
also
is
equipped
with
excellent
weapons
such
cavalry
will
break
the
strongest
battalions
if
its
leader
has
sense
enough
to
know
its
power
and
courage
enough
to
use
this
power
breaking
is
not
enough
and
is
a
feat
that
costs
more
than
it
is
worth
if
the
whole
battalion
is
not
killed
or
taken
prisoner
or
at
least
if
the
cavalry
is
not
immediately
followed
by
other
troops
charged
with
this
task
at
waterloo
our
cavalry
was
exhausted
fruitlessly
because
it
acted
without
artillery
or
infantry
support
at
krasno
august
murat
at
the
head
of
his
cavalry
could
not
break
an
isolated
body
of
ten
thousand
russian
infantry
which
continually
held
him
off
by
its
fire
and
retired
tranquilly
across
the
plain
the
was
upset
by
cavalry
at
solferino
from
ancient
days
the
lone
infantryman
has
always
had
the
advantage
over
the
lone
cavalryman
there
is
no
shadow
of
a
doubt
about
this
in
ancient
narrations
the
cavalryman
only
fought
the
cavalryman
he
threatened
harassed
troubled
the
infantryman
in
the
rear
but
he
did
not
fight
him
he
slaughtered
him
when
put
to
flight
by
other
infantry
or
at
least
he
scattered
him
and
the
light
infantry
slaughtered
him
cavalry
is
a
terrible
weapon
in
the
hands
of
one
who
knows
how
to
use
it
who
can
say
that
epaminondas
could
have
defeated
the
spartans
twice
without
his
thessalonian
cavalry
eventually
rifle
and
artillery
fire
deafen
the
soldier
fatigue
overpowers
him
he
becomes
inert
he
hears
commands
no
longer
if
cavalry
unexpectedly
appears
he
is
lost
cavalry
conquers
merely
by
its
appearance
bismarck
or
decker
modern
cavalry
like
ancient
cavalry
has
a
real
effect
only
on
troops
already
broken
on
infantry
engaged
with
infantry
on
cavalry
disorganized
by
artillery
fire
or
by
a
frontal
demonstration
but
against
such
troops
its
action
is
decisive
in
such
cases
its
action
is
certain
and
gives
enormous
results
you
might
fight
all
day
and
lose
ten
thousand
men
the
enemy
might
lose
as
many
but
if
your
cavalry
pursues
him
it
will
take
thirty
thousand
prisoners
its
role
is
less
knightly
than
its
reputation
and
appearance
less
so
than
the
rôle
of
infantry
it
always
loses
much
less
than
infantry
its
greatest
effect
is
the
effect
of
surprise
and
it
is
thereby
that
it
gets
such
astonishing
results
what
formation
should
infantry
armed
with
modern
weapons
take
to
guard
against
flank
attacks
by
cavalry
if
one
fires
four
times
as
fast
if
the
fire
is
better
sustained
one
needs
only
a
quarter
as
many
men
to
guard
a
point
against
cavalry
protection
might
be
secured
by
using
small
groups
placed
the
range
of
a
rifle
shot
apart
and
flanking
each
other
left
on
the
flank
of
the
advance
but
they
must
be
dependable
troops
who
will
not
be
worried
by
what
goes
on
behind
them
armor
and
armament
an
armored
cavalry
is
clearly
required
for
moral
reasons
note
this
with
reference
to
the
influence
of
cuirassiers
armored
cavalrymen
on
morale
at
the
battle
of
renty
in
tavannes
a
marshal
had
with
him
his
company
armored
in
steel
it
was
the
first
time
that
such
armor
had
been
seen
supported
by
some
hundreds
of
fugitives
who
had
rallied
he
threw
himself
at
the
head
of
his
company
on
a
column
of
two
thousand
german
cavalry
who
had
just
thrown
both
infantry
and
cavalry
into
disorder
he
chose
his
time
so
well
that
he
broke
and
carried
away
these
two
thousand
germans
who
fell
back
and
broke
the
twelve
hundred
light
horsemen
who
were
supporting
them
there
followed
a
general
flight
and
the
battle
was
won
general
renard
says
the
decadence
of
cavalry
caused
the
disappearance
of
their
square
formations
in
battle
which
were
characteristic
in
the
seventeenth
century
it
was
not
the
decadence
of
the
cavalry
but
the
abandonment
of
the
cuirass
and
the
perfecting
of
the
infantry
weapon
to
give
more
rapid
fire
when
cuirassiers
break
through
they
serve
as
examples
and
emulation
extends
to
others
who
another
time
try
to
break
through
as
they
did
why
cuirassiers
because
they
alone
in
all
history
have
charged
and
do
charge
to
the
end
to
charge
to
the
end
the
cuirassiers
need
only
half
the
courage
of
the
dragoons
as
their
armor
raises
their
morale
one
half
but
since
the
cuirassiers
have
as
much
natural
courage
as
the
dragoons
for
they
are
all
the
same
men
it
is
proper
to
count
the
more
on
their
action
shall
we
have
only
one
kind
of
cavalry
which
if
all
our
cavalry
could
wear
the
cuirass
and
at
the
same
time
do
the
fatiguing
work
of
light
cavalry
if
all
our
horses
could
in
addition
carry
the
cuirass
through
such
work
i
say
that
there
should
be
only
cuirassiers
but
i
do
not
understand
why
the
morale
given
by
the
cuirass
should
be
lightly
done
away
with
merely
to
have
one
cavalry
without
the
cuirass
a
cavalryman
armored
completely
and
his
horse
partially
can
charge
only
at
a
trot
on
the
appearance
of
fire
arms
cavalry
according
to
general
ambert
an
author
of
the
past
covered
itself
with
masses
of
armor
resembling
anvils
rather
than
with
cuirasses
it
was
at
that
time
the
essential
arm
later
as
infantry
progressed
the
tactics
changed
it
needed
more
mobility
permanent
armies
began
to
be
organized
by
the
state
the
state
thought
less
of
the
skin
of
the
individual
than
of
economy
and
mobility
and
almost
did
away
with
cuirassiers
the
cuirass
has
always
given
and
today
more
than
ever
it
will
give
confidence
to
the
cavalryman
courage
dash
and
speed
have
a
value
beyond
that
of
mere
mass
i
leave
aside
mathematical
discussions
which
seem
to
me
to
have
nothing
in
common
with
battle
conditions
i
would
pick
to
wear
the
cuirass
the
best
men
in
the
army
big
chested
strong
limbed
the
foot
chasseurs
i
would
organize
a
regiment
of
light
cuirassiers
for
each
of
our
divisions
men
and
horses
such
a
cavalry
would
be
much
more
robust
and
active
than
our
present
cuirassiers
if
our
armored
cavalry
is
worth
more
than
any
other
arm
by
its
dash
in
battle
this
cavalry
would
be
worth
twice
as
much
but
how
would
these
men
of
small
stature
get
into
the
saddle
to
this
serious
objection
i
answer
they
will
arrange
it
and
this
objection
which
i
do
not
admit
is
the
only
one
that
can
be
made
against
the
organization
of
a
light
armored
cavalry
an
organization
that
is
made
imperative
by
the
improvement
in
weapons
the
remainder
of
those
chasseur
battalions
which
furnish
cuirassiers
should
return
to
the
infantry
which
has
long
demanded
them
and
hussars
and
dragoons
dismounted
in
the
necessary
number
will
also
be
welcomed
by
the
infantry
as
for
the
thrust
the
thrust
is
deadlier
than
the
cut
you
do
not
have
to
worry
about
lifting
your
arm
you
thrust
but
it
is
necessary
that
the
cavalryman
be
convinced
that
to
parry
a
vertical
cut
is
folly
this
can
be
done
by
his
officers
by
those
who
have
had
experience
if
there
are
any
such
in
peace
times
this
is
not
easy
but
in
this
respect
as
in
all
others
the
advantage
lies
with
the
brave
a
cavalry
charge
is
a
matter
of
morale
above
all
it
is
identical
in
its
methods
its
effects
with
the
infantry
charge
all
the
conditions
to
be
fulfilled
in
the
charge
walk
trot
gallop
charge
etc
have
a
reason
bearing
on
morale
these
reasons
have
already
been
touched
on
roman
discipline
and
character
demand
tenacity
the
hardening
of
the
men
to
fatigue
and
a
good
organization
giving
mutual
support
produced
that
tenacity
against
which
the
bravest
could
not
stand
the
exhausting
method
of
powerful
strokes
used
by
the
gauls
could
not
last
long
against
the
skillful
terrible
and
less
fatiguing
method
of
fighting
by
the
thrust
the
sikh
cavalrymen
of
nolan
armed
with
dragoon
sabers
sharpened
by
themselves
liked
the
cut
they
knew
nothing
about
methods
of
swordsmanship
they
did
not
practice
they
said
a
good
saber
and
a
willingness
to
use
it
are
enough
true
true
there
is
always
discussion
as
to
the
lance
or
the
saber
the
lance
requires
skillful
vigorous
cavalrymen
good
horsemen
very
well
drilled
very
adroit
for
the
use
of
the
lance
is
more
difficult
than
that
of
the
straight
sword
especially
if
the
sword
is
not
too
heavy
is
not
this
an
answer
to
the
question
no
matter
what
is
done
no
matter
what
methods
are
adopted
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
our
recruits
in
war
time
are
sent
into
squadrons
as
into
battalions
with
a
hasty
and
incomplete
training
if
you
give
them
lances
most
of
them
will
just
have
sticks
in
their
hands
while
a
straight
sword
at
the
end
of
a
strong
arm
is
at
the
same
time
simple
and
terrible
a
short
trident
spear
with
three
short
points
just
long
enough
to
kill
but
not
only
enough
to
go
through
the
body
would
remain
in
the
body
of
the
man
and
carry
him
along
it
would
recoil
on
the
cavalryman
who
delivered
the
blow
he
would
be
upset
by
the
blow
himself
but
the
dragoon
must
be
supported
by
the
saddle
and
as
he
had
kept
hold
of
the
shaft
he
would
be
able
to
disengage
the
fork
which
had
pierced
the
body
some
six
inches
no
cavalry
of
equal
morale
could
stand
against
a
cavalry
armed
with
such
forked
spears
as
between
forks
and
lances
the
fork
would
replace
the
lance
that
is
of
course
for
beginners
in
mounted
fencing
but
the
fork
it
would
be
ridiculous
not
military
with
the
lance
one
always
figures
without
the
horse
whose
slightest
movement
diverts
the
lance
so
much
the
lance
is
a
weapon
frightful
even
to
the
mounted
man
who
uses
it
properly
if
he
sticks
an
enemy
at
the
gallop
he
is
dismounted
torn
off
by
the
arm
attached
to
the
lance
which
remains
in
the
body
of
his
enemy
cavalry
officers
and
others
who
seek
examples
in
victories
and
conquests
in
official
reports
in
bazancourt
are
too
naïve
it
is
hard
to
get
at
the
truth
in
war
in
all
things
we
take
the
last
example
which
we
have
witnessed
and
now
we
want
lances
which
we
do
not
know
how
to
use
which
frighten
the
cavalryman
himself
and
pluck
him
from
the
saddle
if
he
sticks
anybody
we
want
no
more
cuirasses
we
want
this
and
that
we
forget
that
the
last
example
gives
only
a
restricted
number
of
instances
relating
to
the
matter
in
question
it
appears
according
to
xenophon
that
it
was
not
easy
to
throw
the
dart
from
horseback
he
constantly
recommends
obtaining
as
many
men
as
possible
who
know
how
to
throw
the
dart
he
recommends
leaning
well
back
to
avoid
falling
from
the
horse
in
the
charge
in
reading
xenophon
it
is
evident
that
there
was
much
falling
from
the
horse
it
appears
that
in
battle
there
is
as
great
difficulty
in
handling
the
saber
as
in
handling
the
bayonet
another
difficulty
for
the
cavalryman
lies
in
the
handling
of
the
musket
this
is
seen
in
the
handling
of
the
regulation
weapon
of
the
spahis
there
is
only
one
important
thing
for
the
cavalryman
to
be
well
seated
men
should
be
on
horseback
for
hours
at
a
time
every
day
from
their
arrival
in
the
organization
if
the
selection
of
those
who
know
something
about
horses
was
not
neglected
in
the
draft
and
if
such
men
were
made
cavalrymen
the
practical
training
of
the
greater
number
would
be
much
more
rapidly
concluded
i
do
not
speak
of
the
routine
of
the
stable
between
mounted
drills
foot
drills
might
be
gone
through
with
in
a
snappy
free
fashion
without
rigidity
with
daily
increasing
speed
such
drills
would
instruct
cavalrymen
more
rapidly
than
the
restricted
method
employed
a
dragoon
horse
carries
in
campaign
with
one
day
food
three
hundred
and
eight
pounds
without
food
or
forage
two
hundred
and
seventy
seven
pounds
how
can
such
horses
carry
this
and
have
speed
seek
the
end
always
not
the
means
make
a
quarter
of
your
cavalrymen
into
muleteers
a
quarter
of
your
horses
into
pack
animals
you
will
thus
secure
for
the
remaining
three
quarters
unquestioned
vigor
but
how
will
you
make
up
these
pack
trains
you
will
have
plenty
of
wounded
horses
after
a
week
of
campaign
chapter
iv
artillery
if
artillery
did
not
have
a
greater
range
than
the
rifle
we
could
not
risk
separating
it
far
from
its
support
as
it
would
have
to
wait
until
the
enemy
was
but
four
or
five
hundred
paces
away
to
fire
on
him
but
the
more
its
range
is
increased
the
further
away
it
can
be
placed
from
its
support
the
greater
the
range
of
artillery
the
greater
freedom
of
action
from
the
different
arms
which
no
longer
have
to
be
side
by
side
to
give
mutual
support
the
greater
the
range
of
artillery
the
easier
it
is
to
concentrate
its
fire
two
batteries
fifteen
hundred
meters
apart
can
concentrate
on
a
point
twelve
hundred
meters
in
front
of
and
between
them
before
the
range
was
so
long
they
had
to
be
close
together
and
the
terrain
did
not
always
lend
itself
to
this
furthermore
do
not
support
a
piece
by
placing
infantry
just
behind
or
alongside
of
it
as
is
done
of
the
time
at
maneuvers
on
the
contrary
hide
the
infantry
to
the
right
or
left
and
far
behind
cover
it
without
worrying
too
much
about
distance
and
let
the
artillery
call
for
help
if
they
think
that
the
piece
is
in
danger
of
being
lost
why
should
infantry
be
placed
too
close
and
consequently
have
its
advance
demoralized
this
will
throw
away
the
greatest
advantage
that
we
frenchmen
have
in
defense
that
of
defending
ourselves
by
advancing
with
morale
unimpaired
because
we
have
not
suffered
heavy
losses
at
a
halt
there
is
always
time
to
run
to
the
defense
of
artillery
to
increase
the
moral
effect
advance
your
supports
in
formation
skirmishers
can
also
be
swiftly
scattered
among
the
batteries
these
skirmishers
in
the
midst
of
the
guns
will
not
have
to
fear
cavalry
even
if
they
are
assailed
by
infantry
it
will
not
be
such
a
terrible
thing
the
engagement
will
merely
be
one
between
skirmishers
and
they
will
be
able
to
take
cover
behind
the
pieces
firing
against
the
enemy
who
is
coming
up
in
the
open
guibert
i
believe
held
that
artillery
should
not
worry
whether
it
was
supported
or
not
that
it
should
fire
up
to
the
last
minute
and
finally
abandon
the
pieces
which
supporting
troops
might
or
might
not
recapture
these
supporting
troops
should
not
be
too
close
it
is
easier
to
defend
pieces
to
take
them
back
even
by
advancing
on
an
enemy
dispersed
among
them
than
to
defend
them
by
standing
fast
after
having
participated
in
the
losses
suffered
by
the
artillery
under
fire
note
the
english
in
spain
the
system
of
having
artillery
followed
by
infantry
platoons
is
absurd
artillery
in
battle
has
its
men
grouped
around
the
pieces
stationary
assembly
points
broadly
distributed
each
one
having
its
commander
and
its
cannoneers
who
are
always
the
same
thus
there
is
in
effect
a
roll
call
each
time
artillery
is
put
into
battery
artillery
carries
its
men
with
it
they
can
not
be
lost
nor
can
they
hide
if
the
officer
is
brave
his
men
rarely
desert
him
certainly
in
all
armies
it
is
in
the
artillery
that
the
soldier
can
best
perform
his
duty
as
general
leboeuf
tells
us
four
batteries
of
artillery
can
be
maneuvered
not
more
that
is
all
right
here
is
the
thing
in
a
four
battalions
is
a
big
enough
command
for
a
colonel
a
general
has
eight
battalions
he
gets
orders
general
do
so
and
so
he
orders
colonel
do
so
and
so
so
that
without
any
maneuvers
being
laid
down
for
more
than
four
battalions
as
many
battalions
as
you
like
can
be
maneuvered
and
drilled
chapter
v
command
general
staff
and
administration
there
are
plenty
of
carefree
generals
who
are
never
worried
nor
harassed
they
do
not
bother
about
anything
they
say
i
advance
follow
me
the
result
is
an
incredible
disorder
in
the
advance
of
columns
if
ten
raiders
should
fall
on
the
column
with
a
shout
this
disorder
would
become
a
rout
a
disaster
but
these
gentlemen
never
bother
with
such
an
eventuality
they
are
the
great
men
of
the
day
until
the
moment
that
some
disaster
overwhelms
them
cavalry
is
no
more
difficult
to
work
with
than
infantry
according
to
some
military
authors
a
cavalry
general
ought
to
have
the
wisdom
of
the
phoenix
the
perfect
one
should
have
so
should
the
perfect
infantry
general
man
on
horseback
and
man
afoot
is
always
the
same
man
only
the
infantry
general
rarely
has
to
account
for
the
losses
in
his
command
which
may
have
been
due
to
faulty
or
improper
handling
the
cavalry
general
does
have
to
do
this
we
shall
lay
aside
the
reasons
why
the
infantry
general
has
six
chances
for
real
battle
to
one
for
the
cavalry
general
these
are
the
two
reasons
why
from
the
beginning
of
a
war
more
initiative
is
found
in
infantry
than
in
cavalry
generals
general
bugeaud
might
have
made
a
better
cavalry
general
than
an
infantry
general
why
because
he
had
immediate
decision
and
firm
resolution
there
is
more
need
for
resolution
in
the
infantryman
than
in
the
cavalryman
why
there
are
many
reasons
which
are
matters
of
opinion
in
short
the
infantryman
is
always
more
tired
than
the
cavalryman
his
morale
is
therefore
harder
to
keep
up
i
believe
therefore
that
a
good
infantry
general
is
rarer
than
one
of
cavalry
also
the
resolution
of
an
infantry
general
does
not
have
to
last
for
a
moment
only
it
has
to
endure
for
a
long
long
time
good
artillery
generals
are
common
they
are
less
concerned
with
morale
than
with
other
things
such
as
material
results
they
have
less
need
to
bother
about
the
morale
of
their
troops
as
combat
discipline
is
always
better
with
them
than
with
the
other
arms
this
is
shown
elsewhere
brigadier
generals
ought
to
be
in
their
prescribed
places
very
well
but
the
most
of
them
are
not
and
never
have
been
they
were
required
to
be
in
place
at
the
battle
of
moscow
but
as
they
were
so
ordered
there
it
is
evident
that
they
were
not
habitually
in
place
they
are
men
and
their
rank
it
seems
to
them
ought
to
diminish
rather
than
increase
the
risks
they
have
to
run
and
then
in
actual
engagement
where
is
their
prescribed
place
when
one
occupies
a
high
command
there
are
many
things
which
he
does
not
see
the
even
a
division
commander
can
only
escape
this
failing
by
great
activity
moved
by
strict
conscientiousness
and
aided
by
clairvoyance
this
failing
extends
to
those
about
him
to
his
heads
of
services
these
men
live
well
sleep
well
the
same
must
be
true
of
all
they
have
picked
horses
the
roads
are
excellent
they
are
never
sick
the
doctors
must
be
exaggerating
sickness
they
have
attendants
and
doctors
everybody
must
be
well
looked
after
something
happens
which
shows
abominable
negligence
common
enough
in
war
with
a
good
heart
and
a
full
belly
they
say
but
this
is
infamous
unheard
of
it
could
not
have
happened
it
is
impossible
etc
there
is
a
tendency
whose
cause
should
be
sought
on
the
part
of
superiors
to
infringe
on
the
authority
of
inferiors
this
is
general
it
goes
very
high
and
is
furthered
by
the
mania
for
command
inherent
in
the
french
character
it
results
in
lessening
the
authority
of
subordinate
officers
in
the
minds
of
their
soldiers
this
is
a
grave
matter
as
only
the
firm
authority
and
prestige
of
subordinate
officers
can
maintain
discipline
the
tendency
is
to
oppress
subordinates
to
want
to
impose
on
them
in
all
things
the
views
of
the
superior
not
to
admit
of
honest
mistakes
and
to
reprove
them
as
faults
to
make
everybody
even
down
to
the
private
feel
that
there
is
only
one
infallible
authority
a
colonel
for
instance
sets
himself
up
as
the
sole
authority
with
judgment
and
intelligence
he
thus
takes
all
initiative
from
subordinate
officers
and
reduces
them
to
a
state
of
inertia
coming
from
their
lack
of
confidence
in
themselves
and
from
fear
of
being
severely
reproved
how
many
generals
before
a
regiment
think
only
of
showing
how
much
they
know
they
lessen
the
authority
of
the
colonel
that
is
nothing
to
them
they
have
asserted
their
superiority
true
or
false
that
is
the
essential
with
cheeks
puffed
out
they
leave
proud
of
having
attacked
discipline
this
firm
hand
which
directs
so
many
things
is
absent
for
a
moment
all
subordinate
officers
up
to
this
moment
have
been
held
with
too
strong
a
hand
which
has
kept
them
in
a
position
not
natural
to
them
immediately
they
are
like
a
horse
always
kept
on
a
tight
rein
whose
rein
is
loosened
or
missing
they
can
not
in
an
instant
recover
that
confidence
in
themselves
that
has
been
painstakingly
taken
away
from
them
without
their
wishing
it
thus
in
such
a
moment
conditions
become
unsatisfactory
the
soldier
very
quickly
feels
that
the
hand
that
holds
him
vacillates
ask
much
in
order
to
obtain
a
little
is
a
false
saying
a
source
of
errors
an
attack
on
discipline
one
ought
to
obtain
what
one
asks
it
is
only
necessary
to
be
moderately
reasonable
and
practical
in
following
out
this
matter
one
is
astonished
at
the
lack
of
foresight
found
in
three
out
of
four
officers
why
is
there
anything
so
difficult
about
looking
forward
a
little
are
of
the
officers
so
stupid
no
it
is
because
their
egoism
generally
frankly
acknowledged
allow
them
to
think
only
of
who
is
looking
at
them
they
think
of
their
troops
by
chance
perhaps
or
because
they
have
to
their
troops
are
never
their
preoccupation
consequently
they
do
not
think
about
them
at
all
a
major
in
command
of
an
organization
in
mexico
on
his
first
march
in
a
hot
country
started
without
full
canteens
perhaps
without
canteens
at
all
without
any
provision
for
water
as
he
might
march
in
france
no
officer
in
his
battalion
called
his
attention
to
the
omission
nor
was
more
foresighted
than
he
in
this
first
march
by
an
entire
lack
of
foresight
in
everything
he
lost
in
dead
half
of
his
command
was
he
reduced
no
he
was
made
a
officers
of
the
general
staff
learn
to
order
not
to
command
sir
i
order
a
popular
phrase
applies
to
them
the
misfortune
is
not
that
there
is
a
general
staff
but
that
it
has
achieved
command
for
it
always
has
commanded
in
the
name
of
its
commanders
it
is
true
and
never
obeyed
which
is
its
duty
it
commands
in
fact
so
be
it
but
just
the
same
it
is
not
supposed
to
is
it
the
good
quality
of
staffs
or
that
of
combatants
that
makes
the
strength
of
armies
if
you
want
good
fighting
men
do
everything
to
excite
their
ambition
to
spare
them
so
that
people
of
intelligence
and
with
a
future
will
not
despise
the
line
but
will
elect
to
serve
in
it
it
is
the
line
that
gives
you
your
high
command
the
line
only
and
very
rarely
the
staff
the
staff
however
dies
infrequently
which
is
something
do
they
say
that
military
science
can
only
be
learned
in
the
general
staff
schools
if
you
really
want
to
learn
to
do
your
work
go
to
the
line
nobody
knows
anything
unless
he
knows
how
to
argue
and
chatter
a
peasant
knows
nothing
he
is
a
being
unskilled
even
in
cultivating
the
soil
but
the
agriculturist
of
the
office
is
a
farmer
emeritus
etc
is
it
then
believed
that
there
is
ability
only
in
the
general
staff
there
is
the
assurance
of
the
scholar
there
of
the
pedagogue
who
has
never
practiced
what
he
preaches
there
is
book
learning
false
learning
when
it
treats
of
military
matters
but
knowledge
of
the
real
trade
of
a
soldier
knowledge
of
what
is
possible
knowledge
of
blows
given
and
received
all
these
are
conspicuously
absent
slowness
of
promotion
in
the
general
staff
as
compared
to
its
rapidity
in
the
line
might
make
many
men
of
intelligence
of
head
and
heart
pass
the
general
staff
by
and
enter
the
line
to
make
their
own
way
to
be
in
the
line
would
not
then
be
a
brevet
of
imbecility
but
when
general
staff
officers
rank
the
best
of
the
line
the
latter
are
discouraged
and
rather
than
submit
to
this
situation
all
who
feel
themselves
fitted
for
advancement
want
to
be
on
the
general
staff
so
much
the
better
so
much
the
worse
selection
is
only
warranted
by
battle
how
administrative
deceits
in
politics
or
elsewhere
falsify
the
conclusions
drawn
from
a
fact
in
the
crimea
one
hundred
per
cent
of
the
french
operated
upon
succumbed
while
only
per
cent
of
the
english
operated
upon
died
that
was
attributed
to
the
difference
in
temperament
the
great
cause
of
this
discrepancy
was
the
difference
in
care
our
newspapers
followed
the
and
rosy
statements
given
out
by
our
own
supply
department
they
pictured
our
sick
in
the
crimea
lying
in
beds
and
cared
for
by
sisters
of
charity
the
fact
is
that
our
soldiers
never
had
sheets
nor
mattresses
nor
the
necessary
changes
of
clothes
in
the
hospitals
that
half
lay
on
mouldy
straw
on
the
ground
under
canvass
the
fact
is
that
such
were
the
conditions
under
which
typhus
claimed
to
thirty
thousand
of
our
sick
after
the
siege
that
thousands
of
pieces
of
hospital
equipment
were
offered
by
the
english
to
our
quartermaster
general
and
that
he
refused
them
everybody
ought
to
have
known
that
he
would
to
accept
such
equipment
was
to
acknowledge
that
he
did
not
have
it
and
he
ought
to
have
had
it
indeed
he
did
according
to
the
newspapers
and
the
quartermaster
reports
there
were
beds
per
hospital
so
that
it
could
be
said
we
have
beds
each
hospital
had
at
this
time
five
hundred
or
more
sick
these
people
are
annoyed
if
they
are
called
hypocrites
while
our
soldiers
were
in
hospitals
without
anything
so
to
speak
the
english
had
big
tents
cots
sheets
even
night
stands
with
urinals
and
our
men
had
not
even
a
cup
to
drink
from
sick
men
were
cared
for
in
the
english
hospitals
they
might
have
been
in
ours
before
they
died
which
they
almost
always
did
it
is
true
that
we
had
the
typhus
and
the
english
had
not
that
was
because
our
men
in
tents
had
the
same
care
as
in
our
hospitals
and
the
english
the
same
care
as
in
their
hospitals
read
the
war
reports
of
supply
departments
and
then
go
unexpectedly
to
verify
them
in
the
hospitals
and
storehouses
have
them
verified
by
calling
up
and
questioning
the
heads
of
departments
but
question
them
conscientiously
without
dictating
the
answers
in
the
crimea
in
may
of
the
first
year
we
were
no
better
off
than
the
english
who
complained
so
much
who
has
dared
to
say
however
that
from
the
time
they
entered
the
hospital
to
the
time
that
they
left
it
dead
evacuated
or
cured
through
fifteen
or
twenty
days
of
cholera
or
typhus
our
men
lay
on
the
same
plank
in
the
same
shoes
drawers
shirts
and
clothing
that
they
brought
in
with
them
they
were
in
a
state
of
living
putrefaction
that
would
by
itself
have
killed
well
men
the
newspapers
chanted
the
praises
of
the
admirable
french
administration
the
second
winter
the
english
had
no
sick
a
smaller
percentage
than
in
london
but
to
the
eternal
shame
of
the
french
command
and
administration
we
lost
in
peace
time
to
thirty
thousand
of
typhus
and
more
than
one
thousand
frozen
to
death
nevertheless
it
appeared
that
we
had
the
most
perfect
administration
in
the
world
and
that
our
generals
no
less
than
our
administration
were
full
of
devoted
solicitude
to
provide
all
the
needs
of
the
soldier
that
is
an
infamous
lie
and
is
known
as
such
let
us
hope
the
americans
have
given
us
a
good
example
the
good
citizens
have
gone
themselves
to
see
how
their
soldiers
were
treated
and
have
provided
for
them
themselves
when
in
france
will
good
citizens
lose
faith
in
this
best
of
administrations
which
is
theirs
when
will
they
confident
in
themselves
do
spontaneously
freely
what
their
administration
can
not
and
never
will
be
able
to
do
the
first
thing
disorganized
in

is
the
administration
the
simplest

the

signs
even
of
order
disappear
in
a
retreat
note
in

crimea
and
everywhere
more
or
less
the
doctor
visit
was
without
benefit
to
the
patient
it
was
made
to
keep
up
his
spirits
but
could
not
be
followed
by
care
due
to
lack
of
personnel
and
material
after
two
or
three
hours
of
work
the
doctor
was
exhausted
in
a
sane
country
the
field
and
permanent
hospitals
ought
to
be
able
to
handle

at

the

it

down
and
it

on
their
existence
as
states
they
recognize
no
superior
jurisdiction
and
call
on
force
to
decide
their
differences
force
decides
whether
or
not
might
was
right
the
weaker
bows
to
necessity
until
a
more
successful
effort
can
be
made
it
is
easy
to
understand
gregory
vii
ideas
on
the
subject
in
peace
armies
are
playthings
in
the
hands
of
princes
if
the
princes
do
not
know
anything
about
them
which
is
usually
the
case
they
disorganize
them
if
they
understand
them
like
the
prince
of
prussia
they
make
their
armies
strong
for
war
the
king
of
prussia
and
the
prussian
nobility
threatened
by
democracy
have
had
to
change
the
passion
for
equality
in
their
people
into
a
passion
for
domination
over
foreign
nations
this
is
easily
done
when
domination
is
crowned
with
success
for
man
who
is
merely
the
friend
of
equality
is
the
lover
of
domination
so
that
he
is
easily
made
to
take
the
shadow
for
the
substance
they
have
succeeded
they
are
forced
to
continue
with
their
system
otherwise
their
status
as
useful
members
of
society
would
be
questioned
and
they
would
perish
as
leaders
in
war
peace
spells
death
to
a
nobility
consequently
nobles
do
not
desire
it
and
stir
up
rivalries
among
peoples
rivalries
which
alone
can
justify
their
existence
as
leaders
in
war
and
consequently
as
leaders
in
peace
this
is
why
the
military
spirit
is
dead
in
france
the
past
does
not
live
again
in
the
spiritual
as
in
the
physical
world
what
is
dead
is
dead
death
comes
only
with
the
exhaustion
of
the
elements
the
conditions
which
are
necessary
for
life
for
these
reasons
revolutionary
wars
continued
into
the
war
with
prussia
for
these
reasons
if
we
had
been
victorious
we
would
have
found
against
us
the
countries
dominated
by
nobilities
austria
russia
england
but
with
us
vanquished
democracy
takes
up
her
work
in
all
european
countries
protected
in
the
security
which
victory
always
gives
to
victors
this
work
is
slower
but
surer
than
the
rapid
work
of
war
which
exalting
rivalries
halts
for
a
moment
the
work
of
democracy
within
the
nations
themselves
democracy
then
takes
up
her
work
with
less
chance
of
being
deterred
by
rivalry
against
us
thus
we
are
closer
to
the
triumph
of
democracy
than
if
we
had
been
victors
french
democracy
rightfully
desires
to
live
and
she
does
not
desire
to
do
so
at
the
expense
of
a
sacrifice
of
national
pride
then
since
she
will
still
be
surrounded
for
a
long
time
by
societies
dominated
by
the
military
element
by
the
nobility
she
must
have
a
dependable
army
and
as
the
military
spirit
is
on
the
wane
in
france
it
must
be
replaced
by
having
noncommissioned
officers
and
officers
well
paid
good
pay
establishes
position
in
a
democracy
and
none
turn
to
the
army
because
it
is
too
poorly
paid
let
us
have
well
paid
mercenaries
by
giving
good
pay
good
material
can
be
secured
thanks
to
the
old
warrior
strain
in
the
race
this
is
the
price
that
must
be
paid
for
security
the
soldier
of
our
day
is
a
merchant
so
much
of
my
flesh
of
my
blood
is
worth
so
much
so
much
of
my
time
of
my
affections
etc
it
is
a
noble
trade
however
perhaps
because
man
blood
is
noble
merchandise
the
finest
that
can
be
dealt
in
guizot
says
get
rich
that
may
seem
cynical
to
prudes
but
it
is
truly
said
those
who
deny
the
sentiment
and
talk
so
loftily
what
do
they
advise
if
not
by
words
then
by
example
they
counsel
the
same
thing
and
example
is
more
contagious
is
not
private
wealth
wealth
in
general
the
avowed
ambition
sought
by
all
democrats
and
others
let
us
be
rich
that
is
to
say
let
us
be
slaves
of
the
needs
that
wealth
creates
the
invalides
in
france
the
institutions
for
pensioners
are
superb
exhibits
of
pomp
and
ostentation
i
wish
that
their
founding
had
been
based
on
ideas
of
justice
and
christianity
and
not
purely
on
considerations
but
the
results
are
disastrous
to
morality
this
collection
of
weaklings
is
a
school
of
depravity
where
the
invalided
soldier
loses
in
vice
his
right
to
respect
some
officers
want
to
transform
regiments
into
permanent
schools
for
officers
of
all
ranks
with
a
course
each
day
in
law
military
art
etc
there
is
little
taste
for
military
life
in
france
such
a
procedure
would
lessen
it
the
leisure
of
army
life
attracts
three
out
of
four
officers
laziness
if
you
like
but
such
is
the
fact
if
you
make
an
officer
a
all
his
life
he
will
send
his
profession
to
the
devil
if
he
can
and
those
who
are
able
to
do
so
will
in
general
be
those
who
have
received
the
best
education
an
army
is
an
extraordinary
thing
but
since
it
is
necessary
there
should
be
no
astonishment
that
extraordinary
means
must
be
taken
to
keep
it
up
such
as
offering
in
peace
time
little
work
and
a
great
deal
of
leisure
an
officer
is
a
sort
of
aristocrat
and
in
france
we
have
no
finer
ideal
of
aristocratic
life
than
one
of
leisure
this
is
not
a
proof
of
the
highest
ideals
nor
of
firmness
of
character
but
what
is
to
be
done
about
it
from
the
fact
that
military
spirit
is
lacking
in
our
nation
and
officers
are
with
greater
difficulty
than
ever
recruited
in
france
it
does
not
follow
that
we
shall
not
have
to
engage
in
war
perhaps
the
contrary
is
true
it
is
not
patriotic
to
say
that
the
military
spirit
is
dead
in
france
the
truth
is
always
patriotic
the
military
spirit
died
with
the
french
nobility
perished
because
it
had
to
perish
because
it
was
exhausted
at
the
end
of
its
life
that
only
dies
which
has
no
longer
the
sap
of
life
and
can
no
longer
live
if
a
thing
is
merely
sick
it
can
return
to
health
but
who
can
say
that
of
the
french
nobility
an
aristocracy
a
nobility
that
dies
dies
always
by
its
own
fault
because
it
no
longer
performs
its
duties
because
it
fails
in
its
task
because
its
functions
are
of
no
more
value
to
the
state
because
there
is
no
longer
any
reason
for
its
existence
in
a
society
whose
final
tendency
is
to
suppress
its
functions
after
had
threatened
our
patriotism
the
natural
desire
for
revived
the
military
spirit
in
the
nation
and
in
the
army
the
empire
developed
this
movement
changed
the
defensive
military
spirit
to
the
offensive
and
used
it
with
increasing
effect
up
to
or
the
military
spirit
of
the
july
restoration
was
a
reminiscence
a
relic
of
the
empire
a
form
of
opposition
to
government
by
liberalism
instead
of
democracy
it
was
really
the
spirit
of
opposition
and
not
the
military
spirit
which
is
essentially
conservative
there
is
no
military
spirit
in
a
democratic
society
where
there
is
no
aristocracy
no
military
nobility
a
democratic
society
is
antagonistic
to
the
military
spirit
the
military
spirit
was
unknown
to
the
romans
they
made
no
distinction
between
military
and
civil
duties
i
think
that
the
military
air
dates
from
the
time
that
the
profession
of
arms
became
a
private
profession
from
the
time
of
the
bravos
the
italian
condottieri
who
were
more
terrifying
to
civilians
than
to
the
enemy
when
the
romans
said
cedant
arma
togae
they
did
not
refer
to
civil
officials
and
soldiers
the
civil
officials
were
then
soldiers
in
their
turn
professional
soldiers
did
not
exist
they
meant
might
gives
way
to
right
machiavelli
quotes
a
proverb
war
makes
thieves
and
peace
has
them
hanged
the
spaniards
in
mexico
which
has
been
in
rebellion
for
forty
years
are
more
or
less
thieves
they
want
to
continue
to
ply
the
trade
civil
authority
exists
no
longer
with
them
and
they
would
look
on
obedience
to
such
an
authority
as
shameful
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
difficulty
of
organizing
a
peaceful
government
in
such
a
country
half
the
population
would
have
to
hang
the
other
half
the
other
half
does
not
want
to
be
hanged
we
are
a
democratic
society
we
become
less
and
less
military
the
prussian
russian
austrian
aristocracies
which
alone
make
the
military
spirit
of
those
states
feel
in
our
democratic
society
an
example
which
threatens
their
existence
as
nobility
as
aristocracy
they
are
our
enemies
and
will
be
until
they
are
wiped
out
until
the
russian
austrian
and
prussian
states
become
democratic
societies
like
ours
it
is
a
matter
of
time
the
prussian
aristocracy
is
young
it
has
not
been
degenerated
by
wealth
luxury
and
servility
of
the
court
the
prussian
court
is
not
a
court
in
the
luxurious
sense
of
the
word
there
is
the
danger
meanwhile
machiavellian
doctrines
not
being
forbidden
to
aristocracies
these
people
appeal
to
german
jingoism
to
german
patriotism
to
all
the
passions
which
move
one
people
who
are
jealous
of
another
all
this
is
meant
to
hide
under
a
patriotic
exterior
their
concern
for
their
own
existence
as
an
aristocracy
as
a
nobility
the
real
menace
of
the
day
is
czarism
stronger
than
the
czars
themselves
which
calls
for
a
crusade
to
drive
back
russia
and
the
uncultured
slav
race
it
is
time
that
we
understood
the
lack
of
power
in
mob
armies
that
we
recall
to
mind
the
first
armies
of
the
revolution
that
were
saved
from
instant
destruction
only
by
the
lack
of
vigor
and
decision
in
european
cabinets
and
armies
look
at
the
examples
of
revolutionaries
of
all
times
who
have
all
to
gain
and
can
not
hope
for
mercy
since
spartacus
have
they
not
always
been
defeated
an
army
is
not
really
strong
unless
it
is
developed
from
a
social
institution
spartacus
and
his
men
were
certainly
terrible
individual
fighters
they
were
gladiators
used
to
struggle
and
death
they
were
prisoners
barbarian
slaves
enraged
by
their
loss
of
liberty
or
escaped
serfs
all
men
who
could
not
hope
for
mercy
what
more
terrible
fighters
could
be
imagined
but
discipline
leadership
all
was
improvised
and
could
not
have
the
firm
discipline
coming
down
from
the
centuries
and
drawn
from
the
social
institutions
of
the
romans
they
were
conquered
time
a
long
time
is
needed
to
give
to
leaders
the
habit
of
command
and
confidence
in
their
authority
to
the
soldiers
confidence
in
their
leaders
and
in
their
fellows
it
is
not
enough
to
order
discipline
the
officers
must
have
the
will
to
enforce
it
and
its
vigorous
enforcement
must
instill
subordination
in
the
soldiers
it
must
make
them
fear
it
more
than
they
fear
the
enemy
blows
how
did
montluc
fight
in
an
aristocratic
society
montluc
shows
us
tells
us
he
advanced
in
the
van
of
the
assault
but
in
bad
places
he
pushed
in
front
of
him
a
soldier
whose
skin
was
not
worth
as
much
as
was
his
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
or
shame
about
doing
this
the
soldier
did
not
protest
the
propriety
of
the
act
was
so
well
established
but
you
officers
try
that
in
a
democratic
army
such
as
we
have
commenced
to
have
such
as
we
shall
later
have
in
danger
the
officer
is
no
better
than
the
soldier
the
soldier
is
willing
enough
to
advance
but
behind
his
officer
also
his
skin
is
no
more
precious
than
is
his
they
must
advance
too
this
very
real
concern
about
equality
in
danger
which
seeks
equality
only
brings
on
hesitation
and
not
resolution
some
fools
may
break
their
heads
in
closing
in
but
the
remainder
will
fire
from
a
distance
not
that
this
will
cause
fewer
losses
far
from
it
italy
will
never
have
a
really
firm
army
the
italians
are
too
civilized
too
fine
too
democratic
in
a
certain
sense
of
the
word
the
spaniards
are
the
same
this
may
cause
laughter
but
it
is
true
the
french
are
indeed
worthy
sons
of
their
fathers
the
gauls
war
the
most
solemn
act
in
the
life
of
a
nation
the
gravest
of
acts
is
a
light
thing
to
them
the
good
frenchman
lets
himself
be
carried
away
inflamed
by
the
most
ridiculous
feats
of
arms
into
the
wildest
enthusiasm
moreover
he
interprets
the
word
honor
in
a
fashion
all
his
own
an
expedition
is
commenced
without
sufficient
reason
and
good
frenchmen
who
do
not
know
why
the
thing
is
done
disapprove
but
presently
blood
is
spilled
good
sense
and
justice
dictate
that
this
spilled
blood
should
taint
those
responsible
for
an
unjust
enterprise
but
jingoism
says
french
blood
has
been
spilled
honor
is
at
stake
and
millions
of
gold
which
is
the
unit
of
labor
millions
of
men
are
sacrificed
to
a
ridiculous
phrase
whence
comes
this
tendency
toward
war
which
characterizes
above
all
the
good
citizen
the
populace
who
are
not
called
upon
personally
to
participate
the
military
man
is
not
so
easily
swayed
some
hope
for
promotion
or
pension
but
even
they
are
sobered
by
their
sense
of
duty
it
comes
from
the
romance
that
clothes
war
and
battle
and
that
has
with
us
ten
times
more
than
elsewhere
the
power
of
exciting
enthusiasm
in
the
people
it
would
be
a
service
to
humanity
and
to
one
people
to
dispell
this
illusion
and
to
show
what
battles
are
they
are
buffooneries
and
none
the
less
buffooneries
because
they
are
made
terrible
by
the
spilling
of
blood
the
actors
heroes
in
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
are
only
poor
folk
torn
between
fear
discipline
and
pride
they
play
some
hours
at
a
game
of
advance
and
retreat
without
ever
meeting
closing
with
even
seeing
closely
the
other
poor
folks
the
enemy
who
are
as
fearful
as
they
but
who
are
caught
in
the
same
web
of
circumstance
what
should
be
considered
is
how
to
organize
an
army
in
a
country
in
which
there
is
at
the
same
time
national
and
provincial
feeling
such
a
country
is
france
where
there
is
no
longer
any
necessity
for
uniting
national
and
provincial
feeling
by
mixing
up
the
soldiers
in
france
will
the
powerful
motif
of
pride
which
comes
from
the
organization
of
units
from
particular
provinces
be
useful
from
the
fusion
of
varying
elements
comes
the
character
of
our
troops
which
is
something
to
be
considered
the
of
the
heavy
cavalry
should
be
noted
it
has
perhaps
too
many
germans
and
men
from
the
northern
provinces
french
sociability
creates
cohesion
in
french
troops
more
quickly
than
could
be
secured
in
troops
in
other
nations
organization
and
discipline
have
the
same
purpose
with
a
proud
people
like
the
french
a
rational
organization
aided
by
french
sociability
can
often
secure
desired
results
without
it
being
necessary
to
use
the
coercion
of
discipline
marshal
de
cyr
said
experienced
soldiers
know
and
others
ought
to
know
that
french
soldiers
once
committed
to
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
will
not
return
to
their
organization
that
day
until
forced
back
into
it
by
the
enemy
during
this
time
they
must
be
considered
as
lost
to
the
rest
of
the
army
at
the
beginning
of
the
empire
officers
trained
in
the
wars
of
the
revolution
by
incessant
fighting
possessed
great
firmness
no
one
would
wish
to
purchase
such
firmness
again
at
the
same
price
but
in
our
modern
wars
the
victor
often
loses
more
than
the
vanquished
apart
from
the
temporary
loss
in
prisoners
the
losses
exceed
the
resources
in
good
men
and
discourage
the
exhausted
who
appear
to
be
very
numerous
and
those
who
are
skilled
in
removing
themselves
from
danger
thus
we
fall
into
disorder
the
duke
of
fezensac
testifying
of
other
times
shows
us
the
same
thing
that
happens
also
we
depend
only
on
mass
action
and
at
that
game
despite
the
cleverest
strategic
handling
we
must
lose
all
and
do
french
officers
lack
firmness
but
have
pride
in
the
face
of
danger
they
lack
composure
they
are
disconcerted
breathless
hesitant
forgetful
unable
to
think
of
a
way
out
they
call
forward
forward
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
handling
a
formation
in
line
is
difficult
especially
since
the
african
campaigns
where
much
is
left
to
the
soldier
the
formation
in
rank
is
then
an
ideal
unobtainable
in
modern
war
but
toward
which
we
should
strive
but
we
are
getting
further
away
from
it
and
then
when
habit
loses
its
hold
natural
instinct
resumes
its
empire
the
remedy
lies
in
an
organization
which
will
establish
cohesion
by
the
mutual
acquaintanceship
of
all
this
will
make
possible
mutual
surveillance
which
has
such
power
over
french
pride
it
might
be
said
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
war
that
in
open
country
and
in
the
plain
and
that
of
posts
garrisoning
positions
in
broken
country
in
a
great
war
with
no
one
occupying
positions
we
should
be
lost
immediately
marshal
saxe
knew
us
well
when
he
said
that
the
french
were
best
for
a
war
of
position
he
recognized
the
lack
of
stability
in
the
ranks
on
getting
within
rifle
range
the
rank
formation
tends
to
disappear
you
hear
officers
who
have
been
under
fire
say
when
you
get
near
the
enemy
the
men
deploy
as
skirmishers
despite
you
the
russians
group
under
fire
their
holding
together
is
the
huddling
of
sheep
moved
by
fear
of
discipline
and
of
danger
there
are
then
two
modes
of
conduct
under
fire
the
french
and
the
russian
the
gauls
seeing
the
firmness
of
the
roman
formation
chained
themselves
together
making
the
first
rank
unbreakable
and
tying
living
to
dead
this
forbade
the
virtue
they
had
not
divined
in
the
roman
formation
the
replacement
of
wounded
and
exhausted
by
fresh
men
from
this
replacement
came
the
firmness
which
seemed
so
striking
to
the
gauls
the
rank
continually
renewed
itself
why
does
the
frenchman
of
in
singular
contrast
to
the
gaul
scatter
under
fire
his
natural
intelligence
his
instinct
under
the
pressure
of
danger
causes
him
to
deploy
his
method
must
be
adopted
in
view
of
the
impossibility
of
the
roman
draconian
discipline
which
put
the
fear
of
death
behind
the
soldier
we
must
adopt
the
soldier
method
and
try
to
put
some
order
into
it
how
by
french
discipline
and
an
organization
that
permits
of
it
broken
covered
country
is
adapted
to
our
methods
the
zouaves
at
magenta
could
not
have
done
so
well
on
another
kind
of
ground
above
all
with
modern
weapons
the
terrain
to
be
advanced
over
must
be
limited
in
depth
how
much
better
modern
tactics
fit
the
impatient
french
character
but
also
how
necessary
it
is
to
guard
against
this
impatience
and
to
keep
supports
and
reserves
under
control
it
should
be
noted
that
german
or
gallic
cavalry
was
always
better
than
roman
cavalry
which
could
not
hold
against
it
even
though
certainly
better
armed
why
was
this
because
decision
impetuosity
even
blind
courage
have
more
chance
with
cavalry
than
with
infantry
the
defeated
cavalry
is
the
least
brave
cavalry
a
note
for
our
cavalry
here
it
was
easier
for
the
gauls
to
have
good
cavalry
than
it
is
for
us
as
fire
did
not
bother
them
in
the
charge
the
frenchman
has
more
qualities
of
the
cavalryman
than
of
the
infantryman
yet
french
infantry
appears
to
be
of
greater
value
why
because
the
use
of
cavalry
on
the
battlefield
requires
rare
decision
and
the
seizing
of
the
crucial
opportunity
if
the
cavalryman
has
not
been
able
to
show
his
worth
it
is
the
fault
of
his
leaders
french
infantry
has
always
been
defeated
by
english
infantry
in
cavalry
combat
the
english
cavalry
has
always
fled
before
the
french
in
those
terrible
cavalry
battles
that
are
always
flights
is
this
because
in
war
man
lasts
longer
in
the
cavalry
and
because
our
cavalrymen
were
older
and
more
seasoned
soldiers
than
our
infantry
this
does
not
apply
to
us
only
if
it
is
true
for
our
cavalrymen
it
is
also
true
for
the
english
cavalrymen
the
reason
is
that
on
the
field
of
battle
the
rôle
of
the
infantryman
against
a
firm
adversary
requires
more
coolness
and
nerve
than
does
the
rôle
of
the
cavalryman
it
requires
the
use
of
tactics
based
on
an
understanding
of
the
national
characteristics
of
ourselves
and
of
our
enemies
against
the
english
the
confidence
in
the
charge
that
is
implanted
in
our
brains
was
completely
betrayed
the
rôle
of
cavalry
against
cavalry
is
simpler
the
french
confidence
in
the
charge
makes
good
fighting
cavalry
and
the
frenchman
is
better
fitted
than
any
other
for
this
role
our
cavalry
charge
better
than
any
other
that
is
the
whole
thing
on
the
battle
field
it
is
understood
as
they
move
faster
than
infantry
their
dash
which
has
its
limits
is
better
preserved
when
they
get
up
to
the
enemy
the
english
have
always
fled
before
our
cavalry
this
proves
that
strong
enough
to
hold
before
the
moral
impulse
of
our
infantry
they
were
not
strong
enough
to
hold
before
the
stronger
impulse
of
cavalry
we
ought
to
be
much
better
cavalrymen
than
infantrymen
because
the
essential
in
a
cavalryman
is
a
fearless
impetuosity
that
is
for
the
soldier
the
cavalry
leader
ought
to
use
this
trait
without
hesitation
at
the
same
time
taking
measures
to
support
it
and
to
guard
against
its
failings
the
attack
is
always
even
on
the
defensive
an
evidence
of
resolution
and
gives
a
moral
ascendancy
its
effect
is
more
immediate
with
cavalry
because
the
movements
of
cavalry
are
more
rapid
and
the
moral
effect
has
less
time
to
be
modified
by
reflection
to
insure
that
the
french
cavalry
be
the
best
in
europe
and
a
really
good
cavalry
it
needs
but
one
thing
to
conform
to
the
national
temperament
to
dare
to
dare
and
to
advance
one
of
the
singular
features
of
french
discipline
is
that
on
the
road
especially
in
campaign
the
methods
of
punishment
for
derelictions
become
illusory
impractical
in
there
were
thousand
skulkers
in
the
army
in
italy
the
soldier
sees
this
immediately
and
lack
of
discipline
ensues
if
our
customs
do
not
permit
of
draconian
discipline
let
us
replace
that
moral
coercion
by
another
let
us
insure
cohesion
by
the
mutual
acquaintanceship
of
men
and
officers
let
us
call
french
sociability
to
our
aid
with
the
romans
discipline
was
severest
and
most
rigidly
enforced
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
it
was
enforced
by
the
soldiers
themselves
why
should
not
the
men
in
our
companies
watch
discipline
and
punish
themselves
they
alone
know
each
other
and
the
maintenance
of
discipline
is
so
much
to
their
interest
as
to
encourage
them
to
stop
skulking
the
thousand
men
who
skulked
in
italy
all
wear
the
italian
medal
they
were
discharged
with
certificates
of
good
conduct
this
certificate
in
campaign
should
be
awarded
by
the
squad
only
in
place
of
that
discipline
must
be
obtained
somehow
and
it
is
placed
as
an
additional
burden
on
the
officer
he
above
all
has
to
uphold
it
he
is
treated
without
regard
for
his
dignity
he
is
made
to
do
the
work
of
the
officer
he
is
used
as
fancy
dictates
this
cohesion
which
we
hope
for
in
units
from
squad
to
company
need
not
be
feared
in
other
armies
it
can
not
develop
to
the
same
point
and
by
the
same
methods
with
them
as
with
us
their
is
not
ours
their
character
is
different
this
individuality
of
squads
and
companies
comes
from
the
of
our
army
and
from
french
sociability
is
it
true
that
the
rations
of
men
and
horses
are
actually
insufficient
in
campaign
this
is
strange
economy
to
neglect
to
increase
the
soldier
pay
five
centimes
it
would
better
his
fare
and
prevent
making
of
an
officer
a
trader
in
vegetables
in
order
to
properly
feed
his
men
yet
millions
are
squandered
each
year
for
uniforms
geegaws
shakos
etc
if
a
big
army
is
needed
it
ought
to
cost
as
little
as
possible
simplicity
in
all
things
down
with
all
sorts
of
plumes
less
amateurs
if
superfluous
trimmings
are
not
cut
down
it
will
be
unfortunate
what
is
the
matter
with
the
sailor
uniform
insignificant
and
annoying
details
abound
while
vital
details
of
proper
footgear
and
instruction
are
neglected
the
question
of
clothing
for
campaign
is
solved
by
adopting
smocks
and
greatcoats
and
by
doing
away
with
headquarters
companies
this
is
the
height
of
folly
i
suppose
it
is
because
our
present
uniforms
need
specialists
to
keep
them
in
condition
and
smocks
and
greatcoats
do
not
appendix
i
memorandum
on
infantry
fire
written
in
editor
note
introduction
it
may
be
said
that
the
history
of
the
development
of
infantry
fire
is
none
too
plain
even
though
fire
action
in
europe
is
almost
the
sole
means
of
destruction
used
by
that
arm
napoleon
said
the
only
method
of
fire
to
be
used
in
war
is
fire
at
will
yet
after
such
a
plain
statement
by
one
who
knew
there
is
a
tendency
to
make
fire
at
command
the
basis
of
infantry
battle
tactics
is
this
correct
experience
only
can
determine
experience
is
gained
but
nothing
especially
in
the
trade
of
war
is
sooner
forgotten
than
experience
so
many
fine
things
can
be
done
beautiful
maneuvers
executed
ingenious
combat
methods
invented
in
the
confines
of
an
office
or
on
the
maneuver
ground
nevertheless
let
us
try
to
hold
to
facts
let
us
consider
in
the
study
of
any
kind
of
fire
a
succinct
history
of
small
arms
let
us
see
what
kind
of
fire
is
used
with
each
weapon
attempting
at
the
same
time
to
separate
that
which
has
actually
happened
from
the
written
account
succinct
history
of
the
development
of
small
arms
from
the
arquebus
to
our
rifle
the
arquebus
in
use
before
the
invention
of
powder
gave
the
general
design
to
fire
arms
the
arquebus
marks
then
the
transition
from
the
mechanically
thrown
missile
to
the
bullet
the
tube
was
kept
to
direct
the
projectile
and
the
bow
and
string
were
replaced
by
a
powder
chamber
and
ignition
apparatus
this
made
a
weapon
very
simple
light
and
easy
to
charge
but
the
small
caliber
ball
thrown
from
a
very
short
barrel
gave
penetration
only
at
short
distances
the
barrel
was
lengthened
the
caliber
increased
and
a
more
efficient
but
a
less
convenient
arm
resulted
it
was
indeed
impossible
to
hold
the
weapon
in
aiming
position
and
withstand
the
recoil
at
the
moment
of
firing
to
lessen
recoil
there
was
attached
to
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
a
hook
to
catch
on
a
fixed
object
at
the
moment
of
discharge
this
was
called
a
hook
arquebus
but
the
hook
could
only
be
used
under
certain
circumstances
to
give
the
arm
a
point
of
support
on
the
body
the
stock
was
lengthened
and
inclined
to
permit
sighting
this
was
the
petrinal
or
poitrinal
the
soldier
had
in
addition
a
forked
support
for
the
barrel
in
the
musket
which
followed
the
stock
was
again
modified
and
held
against
the
shoulder
further
the
firing
mechanism
was
improved
the
arm
had
been
fired
by
a
lighted
match
but
with
the
musket
the
arm
becoming
lighter
and
more
portable
there
came
the
serpentine
lock
the
then
the
finally
the
spanish
lock
and
the
the
adoption
of
the
and
the
bayonet
produced
the
rifle
which
napoleon
regarded
as
the
most
powerful
weapon
that
man
possesses
but
the
rifle
in
its
primitive
state
had
defects
loading
was
slow
it
was
inaccurate
and
under
some
circumstances
it
could
not
be
fired
how
were
these
defects
remedied
as
to
the
loading
weakness
gustavus
adolphus
understanding
the
influence
on
morale
of
rapid
loading
and
the
greater
destruction
caused
by
the
more
rapid
fire
invented
the
cartridge
for
muskets
frederick
or
some
one
of
his
time
the
name
marks
the
period
replaced
wooden
by
cylindrical
iron
ramrods
to
prime
more
quickly
a
conical
funnel
allowed
the
powder
to
pass
from
the
barrel
into
the
these
two
last
improvements
saved
time
in
two
ways
in
priming
and
in
loading
but
it
was
the
adoption
of
the
that
brought
the
greatest
increase
in
rapidity
of
fire
these
successive
improvements
of
the
weapon
all
tending
to
increase
the
rapidity
of
fire
mark
the
most
remarkable
military
periods
of
modern
times

sadowa
accuracy
was
sacrificed
to
rapidity
of
fire
this
will
be
explained
later
only
in
our
day
has
the
general
use
of
rifling
and
of
elongated
projectiles
brought
accuracy
to
the
highest
point
in
our
times
also
the
use
of
fulminate
has
assured
fire
under
all
conditions
we
have
noted
briefly
the
successive
improvements
in
fire
arms
from
the
arquebus
to
the
rifle
have
the
methods
of
employment
made
the
same
progress
progressive
introduction
of
into
the
armament
of
the
infantryman
the
revolution
brought
about
by
powder
not
in
the
art
of
war
but
in
that
of
combat
came
gradually
it
developed
along
with
the
improvement
of
fire
arms
those
arms
gradually
became
those
of
the
infantryman
thus
under
francis
i
the
proportion
of
infantrymen
carrying
fire
arms
to
those
armed
with
pikes
was
one
to
three
or
four
at
the
time
of
the
wars
of
religion
arquebusiers
and
pikemen
were
about
equal
in
number
under
louis
xiii
in
there
were
two
to
one
pike
in
the
war
of
four
to
one
finally
pikes
disappeared
at
first
men
with
were
independent
of
other
combatants
and
functioned
like
light
troops
in
earlier
days
later
the
pikes
and
the
muskets
were
united
in
constituent
elements
of
army
corps
the
most
usual
formation
was
pikes
in
the
center
muskets
on
the
wings
sometimes
the
pikemen
were
in
the
center
of
their
respective
companies
which
were
abreast
or
half
the
musketeers
might
be
in
front
of
the
pikemen
half
behind
or
again
all
the
musketeers
might
be
behind
the
kneeling
pikemen
in
these
last
two
cases
fire
covered
the
whole
front
finally
pike
and
musket
might
alternate
these
combinations
are
found
in
treatises
on
tactics
but
we
do
not
know
by
actual
examples
how
they
worked
in
battle
nor
even
whether
all
were
actually
employed
the
classes
of
fire
employed
with
each
weapon
when
originally
some
of
the
infantry
were
armed
with
the
long
and
heavy
arquebus
in
its
primitive
state
the
feebleness
of
their
fire
caused
montaigne
to
say
certainly
on
military
authority
the
arms
have
so
little
effect
except
on
the
ears
that
their
use
will
be
discontinued
research
is
necessary
to
find
any
mention
of
their
use
in
the
battles
of
that
period
however
we
find
a
valuable
piece
of
information
in
brantôme
writing
of
the
battle
of
pavia
the
marquis
de
pescani
won
the
battle
of
pavia
with
spanish
arquebusiers
in
an
irregular
defiance
of
all
regulation
and
tradition
by
employing
a
new
formation
fifteen
hundred
arquebusiers
the
ablest
the
most
experienced
the
cleverest
above
all
the
most
agile
and
devoted
were
selected
by
the
marquis
de
pescani
instructed
by
him
on
new
lines
and
practiced
for
a
long
time
they
scattered
by
squads
over
the
battlefield
turning
leaping
from
one
place
to
another
with
great
speed
and
thus
escaped
the
cavalry
charge
by
this
new
method
of
fighting
unusual
astonishing
cruel
and
unworthy
these
arquebusiers
greatly
hampered
the
operations
of
the
french
cavalry
who
were
completely
lost
for
they
joined
together
and
in
mass
were
brought
to
earth
by
these
few
brave
and
able
arquebusiers
this
irregular
and
new
method
of
fighting
is
more
easily
imagined
than
described
any
one
who
can
try
it
out
will
find
it
is
good
and
useful
but
it
is
necessary
that
the
arquebusiers
be
good
troops
very
much
on
the
jump
as
the
saying
is
and
above
all
reliable
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
in
noting
the
preceding
that
there
is
always
a
great
difference
between
what
actually
occurred
and
the
description
thereof
made
often
by
men
who
were
not
there
and
god
knows
on
what
authority
nevertheless
there
appears
in
these
lines
of
brantôme
a
first
example
of
the
most
destructive
use
of
the
rifle
in
the
hands
of
skirmishers
during
the
religious
wars
which
consisted
of
skirmishes
and
taking
and
retaking
garrisoned
posts
the
fire
of
arquebusiers
was
executed
without
order
and
individually
as
above
the
soldier
carried
the
powder
charges
in
little
metal
boxes
hung
from
a
bandoleer
a
finer
priming
powder
was
contained
in
a
powder
horn
the
balls
were
carried
in
a
pouch
at
the
onset
the
soldier
had
to
load
his
piece
it
was
thus
that
he
had
to
fight
with
the
match
arquebus
this
was
still
far
from
fire
at
command
however
this
presently
appeared
gustavus
adolphus
was
the
first
who
tried
to
introduce
method
and
coördination
into
infantry
fire
others
eager
for
innovations
followed
in
his
path
there
appeared
successively
fire
by
rank
in
two
ranks
by
subdivision
section
platoon
company
battalion
file
fire
parapet
fire
a
formal
fire
at
will
and
so
many
others
that
we
can
be
sure
that
all
combinations
were
tried
at
this
time
fire
by
ranks
was
undoubtedly
the
first
of
these
it
will
give
us
a
line
on
the
others
infantry
was
formed
six
deep
to
execute
fire
by
rank
all
ranks
except
the
last
knelt
the
last
rank
fired
and
reloaded
the
rank
in
front
of
it
then
rose
and
did
the
same
thing
as
did
all
other
ranks
successively
the
whole
operation
was
then
recommenced
thus
the
first
group
firing
was
executed
successively
by
ranks
montecuculli
said
the
musketeers
are
ranged
six
deep
so
that
the
last
rank
has
reloaded
by
the
time
the
first
has
fired
and
takes
up
the
fire
again
so
that
the
enemy
has
to
face
continuous
fire
however
under
condé
and
turenne
we
see
the
french
army
use
only
fire
at
will
it
is
true
that
at
this
time
fire
was
regarded
only
as
an
accessory
the
infantry
of
the
line
which
since
the
exploit
of
the
flemish
the
swiss
and
the
spaniards
had
seen
their
influence
grow
daily
was
required
for
the
charge
and
the
advance
and
consequently
was
armed
with
pikes
in
the
most
celebrated
battles
of
these
times
rocroi
nordlingen
lens
rethel
and
the
dunes
we
see
the
infantry
work
in
this
way
the
two
armies
in
straight
lines
commenced
by
bombarding
each
other
charged
with
their
cavalry
wings
and
advanced
with
their
infantry
in
the
center
the
bravest
or
best
disciplined
infantry
drove
back
the
other
and
often
if
one
of
its
wings
was
victorious
finished
by
routing
it
no
marked
influence
of
fire
is
found
at
this
time
the
tradition
of
pescani
was
lost
nevertheless
improved
they
became
more
effective
and
tended
to
replace
the
pike
the
use
of
the
pike
obliged
the
soldier
to
remain
in
ranks
to
fight
only
in
certain
cases
and
exposed
him
to
injury
without
being
able
to
return
blow
for
blow
and
this
is
exceedingly
instructive
the
soldier
had
by
this
time
an
instinctive
dislike
of
this
arm
which
often
condemned
him
to
a
passive
role
this
dislike
necessitated
giving
high
pay
and
privilege
to
obtain
pikemen
and
in
spite
of
all
at
the
first
chance
the
soldier
threw
away
his
pike
for
a
musket
the
pikes
themselves
gradually
disappeared
before
firearms
the
ranks
thinned
to
permit
the
use
of
the
latter
four
rank
formation
was
used
and
fire
tried
in
that
order
by
rank
by
two
ranks
upright
kneeling
etc
in
spite
of
these
attempts
we
see
the
french
army
in
combat
notably
at
fontenoy
still
using
fire
at
will
the
soldier
leaving
ranks
to
fire
and
returning
to
load
it
can
be
stated
in
spite
of
numerous
attempts
at
adoption
that
no
fire
at
command
was
used
in
battle
up
to
the
days
of
frederick
already
under
william
the
prussian
infantry
was
noted
for
the
rapidity
and
continuity
of
its
fire
frederick
further
increased
the
ability
of
his
battalions
to
fire
by
decreasing
their
depth
this
fire
tripled
by
speed
in
loading
became
so
heavy
that
it
gave
prussian
battalions
a
superiority
over
others
of
three
to
one
the
prussians
recognized
three
kinds
of
fire
at
a
halt
in
advancing
and
in
retreat
we
know
the
mechanics
of
fire
at
a
halt
the
first
rank
kneeling
of
fire
in
advancing
guibert
says
what
i
call
marching
fire
and
which
anybody
who
thinks
about
it
must
find
as
ill
advised
as
i
do
is
a
fire
i
have
seen
used
by
some
troops
the
soldiers
in
two
ranks
fire
in
marching
but
they
march
of
course
at
a
snail
pace
this
is
what
prussian
troops
call
fire
in
advancing
it
consists
in
combined
and
alternating
volleys
from
platoons
companies
half
battalions
or
battalions
the
parts
of
the
line
which
have
fired
advance
at
the
double
the
others
at
the
half
step
in
other
methods
of
fire
as
we
have
said
the
prussian
battalion
was
in
three
ranks
the
first
kneeling
the
line
delivered
salvos
only
at
command
however
the
theory
of
executing
fire
by
salvo
in
three
ranks
did
not
bother
frederick
old
soldiers
we
will
see
presently
how
they
executed
it
on
the
field
of
battle
be
that
as
it
may
europe
was
impressed
with
these
methods
and
tended
to
adopt
them
provided
for
them
in
the
french
army
and
introduced
fire
at
command
two
regulations
prescribing
this
appeared
in
and
but
in
the
war
which
followed
marshal
de
broglie
who
undoubtedly
had
experience
and
as
much
common
sense
as
prescribed
fire
at
will
all
infantry
in
his
army
was
practiced
in
it
during
the
winter
of
two
new
regulations
succeeded
the
preceding
in
and
the
last
prescribed
fire
in
three
ranks
at
command
all
ranks
upright
thus
we
come
to
the
wars
of
the
revolution
with
regulations
calling
for
fire
at
command
which
was
not
executed
in
battle
since
these
wars
our
armies
have
always
fought
as
skirmishers
in
speaking
of
our
campaigns
fire
at
command
is
never
mentioned
it
was
the
same
under
the
empire
in
spite
of
numerous
essays
from
the
boulogne
school
and
elsewhere
at
the
boulogne
school
fire
at
command
by
ranks
was
first
tried
by
order
of
napoleon
this
fire
to
be
particularly
employed
against
cavalry
in
theory
it
is
superb
does
not
seem
to
have
been
employed
napoleon
says
so
himself
and
the
regulations
of
in
which
some
influence
of
soldiers
of
the
empire
should
be
found
orders
fire
in
two
ranks
or
at
will
by
bodies
of
men
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
according
to
our
military
authority
on
the
authority
of
our
old
officers
fire
at
command
did
not
suit
our
infantry
yet
it
lived
in
the
regulations
general
fririon
and
de
attacked
this
method
nothing
was
done
it
remained
in
the
regulations
of
but
without
being
ordered
in
any
particular
circumstances
it
appeared
there
for
show
purposes
perhaps
on
the
creation
of
the
chasseurs
fire
by
rank
was
revived
but
neither
in
our
african
campaigns
nor
in
our
last
two
wars
in
the
crimea
and
italy
can
a
single
example
of
fire
at
command
be
found
in
practice
it
was
believed
to
be
impracticable
it
was
known
to
be
entirely
ineffective
and
fell
into
disrepute
but
with
the
rifle
there
is
a
tendency
to
believe
it
practicable
and
to
take
it
up
with
new
interest
is
this
more
reasonable
than
in
the
past
let
us
see
methods
of
fire
used
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
methods
recommended
or
ordered
but
impractical
use
and
efficacy
of
fire
at
command
undoubtedly
at
the
potsdam
maneuvers
the
prussian
infantry
used
only
salvos
executed
admirably
an
unbelievable
discipline
kept
the
soldier
in
place
and
in
line
barbaric
punishments
were
incorporated
in
the
military
code
blows
the
whip
executions
punished
the
slightest
derelictions
even
were
subjected
to
blows
with
the
flat
of
the
sword
yet
all
this
was
not
enough
on
the
field
of
battle
a
complete
rank
of
officer
file
closers
was
also
needed
to
hold
the
men
to
their
duty
said
these
hook
their
halberds
together
and
form
a
line
that
can
not
be
broken
in
spite
of
all
this
after
two
or
three
volleys
so
says
general
renard
whom
we
believe
more
than
charitable
there
is
no
power
of
discipline
which
can
prevent
regular
fire
from
breaking
into
fire
at
will
but
let
us
look
further
into
frederick
battles
let
us
take
the
battle
of
mollwitz
in
which
success
was
specifically
laid
to
fire
at
command
half
lost
then
won
by
the
prussian
salvos
the
austrian
infantry
had
opened
fire
on
the
lines
of
the
prussians
whose
cavalry
had
been
routed
it
was
necessary
to
shake
them
to
insure
victory
the
austrians
still
used
wooden
ramrods
their
fire
came
slowly
while
the
prussian
fire
was
thunderous
five
or
six
shots
to
the
rifle
per
minute
the
imperial
troops
surprised
and
disconcerted
by
this
massed
fire
tried
to
hurry
in
their
hurry
many
broke
their
fragile
ramrods
confusion
spread
through
the
ranks
and
the
battle
was
lost
but
if
we
study
actual
conditions
of
the
period
we
see
that
things
did
not
happen
in
such
an
orderly
sequence
firing
started
and
it
is
said
that
it
was
long
and
deadly
the
prussians
iron
ramrods
gave
them
the
advantage
an
enemy
whose
ramrods
were
wooden
harder
to
manipulate
and
easily
broken
however
when
the
order
to
advance
was
given
to
the
prussians
whole
battalions
stood
fast
it
was
impossible
to
budge
them
the
soldiers
tried
to
escape
the
fire
and
got
behind
each
other
so
that
they
were
thirty
to
forty
deep
here
are
men
who
exhibit
under
fire
an
admirable
calm
an
immovable
steadiness
each
instant
they
hear
the
dead
heavy
sound
of
a
bullet
striking
they
see
they
feel
around
them
above
them
between
their
legs
their
comrades
fall
and
writhe
for
the
fire
is
deadly
they
have
the
power
in
their
hands
to
return
blow
for
blow
to
send
back
to
the
enemy
the
death
that
hisses
and
strikes
about
them
they
do
not
take
a
false
step
their
hands
do
not
close
instinctively
on
the
trigger
they
wait
imperturbably
the
order
of
their
chiefs
and
what
chiefs
these
are
the
men
who
at
the
command
forward
lack
bowels
who
huddle
like
sheep
one
behind
the
other
are
we
to
believe
this
let
us
get
to
the
truth
of
the
matter
frederick
veterans
in
spite
of
their
discipline
and
drill
are
unable
to
follow
the
methods
taught
and
ordered
they
are
no
more
able
to
execute
fire
at
command
than
they
are
to
execute
the
ordered
advance
of
the
potsdam
maneuver
field
they
use
fire
at
will
they
fire
fast
from
instinct
stronger
than
their
discipline
which
bids
them
send
two
shots
for
one
their
fire
becomes
indeed
a
thunderous
roll
not
of
salvos
but
of
rapid
fire
at
will
who
fires
most
hits
most
so
the
soldier
figures
so
indeed
did
frederick
for
he
encouraged
fire
in
this
same
battle
of
mollwitz
he
thereafter
doubled
the
number
of
cartridges
given
the
soldier
giving
him
sixty
instead
of
thirty
furthermore
if
fire
at
command
had
been
possible
who
knows
what
frederick
soldiers
would
have
been
capable
of
they
would
have
cut
down
battalions
like
standing
grain
allowed
to
aim
quietly
no
man
interfering
with
another
each
seeing
clearly
then
at
the
signal
all
firing
together
could
anything
hold
against
them
at
the
first
volley
the
enemy
would
have
broken
and
fled
under
the
penalty
of
annihilation
in
case
they
stayed
however
if
we
look
at
the
final
result
at
mollwitz
we
see
that
the
number
of
killed
is
about
the
same
on
the
side
that
used
fire
at
command
as
on
the
side
that
did
not
the
prussians
lost
dead
the
austrians
but
they
say
that
if
fire
was
not
more
deadly
it
was
because
was
then
unknown
what
if
it
was
there
was
no
adjustment
of
fire
perhaps
but
there
were
firing
regulations
aiming
was
known
aiming
is
old
we
do
not
say
it
was
practiced
but
it
was
known
and
often
mentioned
cromwell
often
said
put
your
confidence
in
god
my
children
and
fire
at
their
do
we
set
our
sights
better
it
is
doubtful
if
the
able
soldiers
of
cromwell
of
frederick
of
the
republic
and
of
napoleon
could
not
set
their
sights
can
we
thus
this
fire
at
command
which
was
only
possible
rarely
and
to
commence
action
was
entirely
ineffective
hardy
spirits
seeing
the
slight
effect
of
long
range
firing
in
battle
counselled
waiting
till
the
enemy
was
at
twenty
paces
and
driving
him
back
with
a
volley
you
do
not
have
to
sight
carefully
at
twenty
paces
what
would
be
the
result
at
the
battle
of
castiglione
says
marshal
saxe
the
imperial
troops
let
the
french
approach
to
twenty
paces
hoping
to
destroy
them
by
a
volley
at
that
distance
they
fired
coolly
and
with
all
precautions
but
they
were
broken
before
the
smoke
cleared
at
the
battle
of
belgrade
i
saw
two
battalions
who
at
thirty
paces
aimed
and
fired
at
a
mass
of
turks
the
turks
cut
them
up
only
two
or
three
escaping
the
turkish
loss
in
dead
was
only
no
matter
what
the
marshal
says
we
doubt
that
these
men
were
cool
for
men
who
could
hold
their
fire
up
to
such
a
near
approach
of
the
enemy
and
fire
into
masses
would
have
killed
the
front
rank
thrown
the
others
into
confusion
and
would
never
have
been
cut
up
as
they
were
to
make
these
men
await
without
firing
an
enemy
at
twenty
or
thirty
paces
needed
great
moral
pressure
controlled
by
discipline
they
waited
but
as
one
waits
for
the
roof
to
fall
for
a
bomb
to
explode
full
of
anxiety
and
suppressed
emotion
when
the
order
is
given
to
raise
the
arms
and
fire
the
crisis
is
reached
the
roof
falls
the
bomb
explodes
one
flinches
and
the
bullets
are
fired
into
the
air
if
anybody
is
killed
it
is
an
accident
this
is
what
happened
before
the
use
of
skirmishers
salvos
were
tried
in
action
they
became
fire
at
will
directed
against
troops
advancing
without
firing
they
were
ineffective
they
did
not
halt
the
dash
of
the
assault
and
the
troops
who
had
so
counted
on
them
fled
demoralized
but
when
skirmishers
were
used
salvos
became
impossible
armies
who
held
to
old
methods
learned
this
to
their
cost
in
the
first
days
of
the
revolution
our
troops
undrilled
and
not
strictly
disciplined
could
not
fight
in
line
to
advance
on
the
enemy
a
part
of
the
battalion
was
detached
as
skirmishers
the
remainder
marched
into
battle
and
was
engaged
without
keeping
ranks
the
combat
was
sustained
by
groups
fighting
without
formal
order
the
art
was
to
support
by
reserves
the
troops
advanced
as
skirmishers
the
skirmishers
always
began
the
action
when
indeed
they
did
not
complete
it
to
oppose
fire
by
rank
to
skirmishers
was
fools
play
skirmishers
necessarily
opposed
each
other
once
this
method
was
adopted
they
were
supported
reinforced
by
troops
in
formation
in
the
midst
of
general
firing
fire
at
command
became
impossible
and
was
replaced
by
fire
at
will
dumouriez
at
the
battle
of
jemmapes
threw
out
whole
battalions
as
skirmishers
and
supporting
them
by
light
cavalry
did
wonders
with
them
they
surrounded
the
austrian
redoubts
and
rained
on
the
cannoneers
a
hail
of
bullets
so
violent
that
they
abandoned
their
pieces
the
austrians
astounded
by
this
novel
combat
method
vainly
reinforced
their
light
troops
by
detachments
of
heavy
infantry
their
skirmishers
could
not
resist
our
numbers
and
impetuosity
and
presently
their
line
beaten
by
a
storm
of
bullets
was
forced
back
the
noise
of
battle
the
firing
increased
the
defeated
troops
hearing
commands
no
longer
threw
down
their
arms
and
fled
in
disorder
so
fire
in
line
heavy
as
it
may
be
can
not
prevail
against
the
power
of
numerous
detachments
of
skirmishers
a
rain
of
bullets
directed
aimlessly
is
impotent
against
isolated
men
profiting
by
the
slightest
cover
to
escape
the
fire
of
their
adversaries
while
the
deployed
battalions
offer
to
their
rifles
a
huge
and
relatively
harmless
target
the
dense
line
apparently
so
strong
withers
under
the
deadly
effect
of
the
fire
of
isolated
groups
so
feeble
in
appearance
general
renard
the
prussians
suffered
in
the
same
way
at
jena
their
lines
tried
fire
at
command
against
our
skirmishers
you
might
as
well
fire
on
a
handful
of
fleas
they
tell
us
of
the
english
salvos
at
in
calabria
and
later
in
spain
in
these
particular
cases
they
could
be
used
because
our
troops
charged
without
first
sending
out
skirmishers
the
battle
of
only
lasted
half
an
hour
it
was
badly
conceived
and
executed
and
if
says
general
duhesme
the
advancing
battalions
had
been
preceded
by
detachments
of
skirmishers
who
had
already
made
holes
in
enemy
ranks
and
on
close
approach
the
heads
of
columns
had
been
launched
in
a
charge
the
english
line
would
not
have
conserved
that
coolness
which
made
their
fire
so
effective
and
accurate
certainly
it
would
not
have
waited
so
long
to
loose
its
fire
if
it
had
been
vigorously
harassed
by
skirmishers
an
english
author
treating
of
the
history
of
weapons
speaks
of
the
rolling
fire
well
directed
of
the
english
troops
he
makes
no
mention
of
salvos
perhaps
we
were
mistaken
and
in
our
accounts
have
taken
the
fire
of
a
battalion
for
the
formal
battalion
fire
at
command
of
our
regulations
the
same
tendency
appears
more
clearly
in
the
work
on
infantry
of
the
marquis
de
chambray
who
knew
the
english
army
well
he
says
that
the
english
in
spain
used
almost
entirely
fire
in
two
ranks
they
employed
battalion
fire
only
when
attacked
by
our
troops
without
skirmishers
firing
on
the
flanks
of
our
columns
and
he
says
the
fire
by
battalion
by
half
battalion
and
by
platoon
is
limited
to
the
target
range
the
fire
actually
most
used
in
war
is
that
in
two
ranks
the
only
one
used
by
the
french
later
he
adds
experience
proves
fire
in
two
ranks
the
only
one
to
be
used
against
the
enemy
before
him
marshal
saxe
wrote
avoid
dangerous
maneuvers
such
as
fire
by
platoon
which
have
often
caused
shameful
defeats
these
statements
are
as
true
now
as
then
fire
at
command
by
platoon
by
battalion
is
used
in
case
the
enemy
having
repulsed
skirmishers
and
arrived
at
a
reasonable
range
either
charges
or
opens
fire
for
effect
himself
if
the
latter
fire
is
reciprocal
and
lasts
until
one
or
the
other
gives
way
or
charges
if
the
enemy
charges
what
happens
he
advances
preceded
by
skirmishers
who
deliver
a
hail
of
bullets
you
wish
to
open
fire
but
the
voices
of
your
officers
are
lost
the
noise
of
artillery
of
small
arms
the
confusion
of
battle
the
shrieks
of
the
wounded
distract
the
soldiers
attention
before
you
have
delivered
your
command
the
line
is
ablaze
then
try
to
stop
your
soldiers
while
there
is
a
cartridge
left
they
will
fire
the
enemy
may
find
a
fold
of
ground
that
protects
him
he
may
adopt
in
place
of
his
deployed
order
columns
with
wide
intervals
between
or
otherwise
change
his
dispositions
the
changing
incidents
of
battle
are
hidden
by
smoke
and
the
troops
in
front
from
the
view
of
the
officers
behind
the
soldiers
will
continue
to
fire
and
the
officers
can
do
nothing
about
it
all
this
has
been
said
already
has
been
gone
into
and
fire
at
command
has
been
abandoned
why
take
it
up
again
it
comes
to
us
probably
from
the
prussians
indeed
the
reports
of
their
general
staff
on
their
last
campaign
of
say
that
it
was
very
effectively
employed
and
cite
many
examples
but
a
prussian
officer
who
went
through
the
campaign
in
the
ranks
and
saw
things
close
up
says
in
examining
the
battles
of
for
characteristics
one
is
struck
by
a
feature
common
to
all
the
extraordinary
extension
of
front
at
the
expense
of
depth
either
the
front
is
spun
out
into
a
single
long
thin
line
or
it
is
broken
into
various
parts
that
fight
by
themselves
above
all
the
tendency
is
evident
to
envelop
the
enemy
by
extending
the
wings
there
is
no
longer
any
question
of
keeping
the
original
order
of
battle
different
units
are
confused
by
battle
or
even
before
battle
detachments
and
large
units
of
any
corps
are
composed
of
diverse
and
heterogeneous
elements
the
battle
is
fought
almost
exclusively
by
columns
of
companies
rarely
of
the
tactics
of
these
columns
consists
in
throwing
out
strong
detachments
of
skirmishers
gradually
the
supports
are
engaged
and
deployed
the
line
is
broken
scattered
like
a
horde
of
irregular
cavalry
the
second
line
which
has
held
close
order
tries
to
get
up
to
the
first
promptly
first
to
engage
in
the
fight
also
because
they
suffer
losses
from
the
high
shots
directed
at
the
first
line
it
suffers
losses
that
are
heavy
as
it
is
compact
and
supports
them
with
impatience
as
it
does
not
yet
feel
the
fever
of
battle
the
most
of
the
second
line
then
forces
entry
into
the
first
and
as
there
is
more
room
on
the
wings
it
gravitates
to
the
wings
very
often
even
the
reserve
is
drawn
in
entirely
or
so
largely
that
it
can
not
fulfill
its
mission
in
fact
the
fighting
of
the
first
two
lines
is
a
series
of
combats
between
company
commands
and
the
enemy
each
command
faces
superior
officers
can
not
follow
on
horseback
all
the
units
which
push
ahead
over
all
sorts
of
ground
they
have
to
dismount
and
attach
themselves
to
the
first
unit
of
their
command
met
unable
to
manipulate
their
whole
command
in
order
to
do
something
they
command
the
smaller
unit
it
is
not
always
better
commanded
at
that
even
generals
find
themselves
in
this
situation
here
is
something
we
understand
better
it
is
certainly
what
occurs
as
for
the
instances
cited
in
the
general
staff
reports
they
deal
with
companies
or
at
most
not
withstanding
the
complacency
with
which
they
are
cited
they
must
have
been
rare
and
the
exception
should
not
be
taken
as
establishing
a
rule
fire
at
will
its
efficacy
thus
fire
at
command
as
in
the
past
is
impractical
and
consequently
not
actually
used
in
battle
the
only
means
employed
are
fire
at
will
and
the
fire
of
skirmishers
let
us
look
into
their
efficacy
competent
authorities
have
compiled
statistics
on
this
point
guibert
thinks
that
not
over
two
thousand
men
are
killed
or
wounded
by
each
million
cartridges
used
in
battle
gassendi
assures
us
that
of
three
thousand
shots
only
one
is
a
hit
piobert
says
that
the
estimate
based
on
the
result
of
long
wars
is
that
three
to
ten
thousand
cartridges
are
expended
for
each
man
hit
with
accurate
and
long
range
weapons
have
things
changed
much
we
do
not
think
so
the
number
of
bullets
fired
must
be
compared
with
the
number
of
men
dropped
with
a
deduction
made
for
the
action
of
artillery
which
must
be
considered
a
german
author
has
advanced
the
opinion
that
with
the
prussian
needle
rifle
the
hits
are
of
the
shots
fired
but
then
how
explain
the
disappointment
of
dreyse
the
happy
inventor
of
the
needle
rifle
when
he
compared
prussian
and
austrian
losses
this
good
old
gentleman
was
disagreeably
astonished
at
seeing
that
his
rifle
had
not
come
up
to
his
expectations
fire
at
will
as
we
shall
presently
show
is
a
fire
to
occupy
the
men
in
the
ranks
but
its
effect
is
not
great
we
could
give
many
examples
we
only
cite
one
but
it
is
conclusive
has
it
not
been
remarked
says
general
duhesme
that
before
a
firing
line
there
is
raised
a
veil
of
smoke
which
on
one
side
or
the
other
hides
the
troops
from
view
and
makes
the
fire
of
the
best
placed
troops
uncertain
and
practically
without
effect
i
proved
it
conclusively
at
the
battle
of
caldiero
in
one
of
the
successive
advances
that
occurred
on
my
left
wing
i
saw
some
battalions
which
i
had
rallied
halted
and
using
an
individual
fire
which
they
could
not
keep
up
for
long
i
went
there
i
saw
through
the
smoke
cloud
nothing
but
flashes
the
glint
of
bayonets
and
the
tops
of
grenadier
caps
we
were
not
far
from
the
enemy
however
perhaps
sixty
paces
a
ravine
separated
us
but
it
could
not
be
seen
i
went
into
the
ranks
which
were
neither
closed
nor
aligned
throwing
up
with
my
hand
the
soldiers
rifles
to
get
them
to
cease
firing
and
to
advance
i
was
mounted
followed
by
a
dozen
orderlies
none
of
us
were
wounded
nor
did
i
see
an
infantryman
fall
well
then
hardly
had
our
line
started
when
the
austrians
heedless
of
the
obstacle
that
separated
us
retreated
it
is
probable
that
had
the
austrians
started
to
move
first
the
french
would
have
given
way
it
was
veterans
of
the
empire
who
certainly
were
as
reliable
as
our
men
who
gave
this
example
of
lack
of
coolness
in
ranks
fire
at
will
is
the
only
possible
one
for
our
officers
and
men
but
with
the
excitement
the
smoke
the
annoying
incidents
one
is
lucky
to
get
even
horizontal
fire
to
say
nothing
of
aimed
fire
in
fire
at
will
without
taking
count
of
any
trembling
men
interfere
with
each
other
whoever
advances
or
who
gives
way
to
the
recoil
of
his
weapon
deranges
the
shot
of
his
neighbor
with
full
pack
the
second
rank
has
no
loophole
it
fires
in
the
air
on
the
range
spacing
men
to
the
extremity
of
the
limits
of
formation
firing
very
slowly
men
are
found
who
are
cool
and
not
too
much
bothered
by
the
crack
of
discharge
in
their
ears
who
let
the
smoke
pass
and
seize
a
loophole
of
pretty
good
visibility
who
try
in
a
word
not
to
lose
their
shots
and
the
percentage
results
show
much
more
regularity
than
with
fire
at
command
but
in
front
of
the
enemy
fire
at
will
becomes
in
an
instant
haphazard
fire
each
man
fires
as
much
as
possible
that
is
to
say
as
badly
as
possible
there
are
physical
and
mental
reasons
why
this
is
so
even
at
close
range
in
battle
the
cannon
can
fire
well
the
gunner
protected
in
part
by
his
piece
has
an
instant
of
coolness
in
which
to
lay
accurately
that
his
pulse
is
racing
does
not
derange
his
line
of
sight
if
he
has
will
power
the
eye
trembles
little
and
the
piece
once
laid
remains
so
until
fired
the
rifleman
like
the
gunner
only
by
keeps
his
ability
to
aim
but
the
excitement
in
the
blood
of
the
nervous
system
opposes
the
immobility
of
the
weapon
in
his
hands
no
matter
how
supported
a
part
of
the
weapon
always
shares
the
agitation
of
the
man
he
is
instinctively
in
haste
to
fire
his
shot
which
may
stop
the
departure
of
the
bullet
destined
for
him
however
lively
the
fire
is
this
vague
reasoning
unformed
as
it
is
in
his
mind
controls
with
all
the
force
of
the
instinct
of
self
preservation
even
the
bravest
and
most
reliable
soldiers
then
fire
madly
the
greater
number
fire
from
the
hip
the
theory
of
the
range
is
that
with
continual
pressure
on
the
trigger
the
shot
surprises
the
firer
but
who
practices
it
under
fire
however
the
tendency
in
france
is
to
seek
only
accuracy
what
good
will
it
do
when
smoke
fog
darkness
long
range
excitement
the
lack
of
coolness
forbid
clear
sight
it
is
hard
to
say
after
the
feats
of
fire
at
sebastopol
in
italy
that
accurate
weapons
have
given
us
no
more
valuable
service
than
a
simple
rifle
just
the
same
to
one
who
has
seen
facts
are
facts
but
see
how
history
is
written
it
has
been
set
down
that
the
russians
were
beaten
at
inkermann
by
the
range
and
accuracy
of
weapons
of
the
french
troops
but
the
battle
was
fought
in
thickets
and
wooded
country
in
a
dense
fog
and
when
the
weather
cleared
our
soldiers
our
chasseurs
were
out
of
ammunition
and
borrowed
from
the
russian
cartridge
boxes
amply
provided
with
cartridges
for
round
small
calibered
bullets
in
either
case
there
could
have
been
no
accurate
fire
the
facts
are
that
the
russians
were
beaten
by
superior
morale
that
unaimed
fire
at
random
there
perhaps
more
than
elsewhere
had
the
only
material
effect
when
one
fires
and
can
only
fire
at
random
who
fires
most
hits
most
or
perhaps
it
is
better
said
that
who
fires
least
expects
to
be
hit
most
frederick
was
impressed
with
this
for
he
did
not
believe
in
the
potsdam
maneuvers
the
wily
fritz
looked
on
fire
as
a
means
to
quiet
and
occupy
the
undependable
soldiers
and
it
proved
his
ability
that
he
could
put
into
practice
that
which
might
have
been
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
any
other
general
officer
he
knew
very
well
how
to
count
on
the
effect
of
his
fire
how
many
thousand
cartridges
it
took
to
kill
or
wound
an
enemy
at
first
his
soldiers
had
only
thirty
cartridges
he
found
the
number
insufficient
and
after
mollwitz
gave
them
sixty
as
in
frederick
day
it
is
rapid
random
fire
the
only
one
practicable
which
has
given
prestige
to
the
prussians
this
idea
of
rapid
fire
was
lost
after
frederick
but
the
prussians
have
recovered
it
by
exercising
common
sense
however
our
veterans
of
the
empire
had
preserved
this
idea
which
comes
from
instinct
they
enlarged
their
vents
scornful
of
flare
backs
to
avoid
having
to
open
the
chamber
and
prime
the
bullet
having
a
good
deal
of
clearance
when
the
cartridge
was
torn
and
put
in
the
gun
with
a
blow
of
the
butt
on
the
ground
they
had
their
arms
charged
and
primed
but
as
then
in
spite
of
skill
acquired
in
individual
fire
men
stop
aiming
and
fire
badly
as
soon
as
they
are
grouped
into
platoons
to
fire
prussian
officers
who
are
practical
men
know
that
adjustment
of
sights
is
impracticable
in
the
heat
of
action
and
that
in
fire
by
volleys
troops
tend
to
use
the
full
sight
so
in
the
war
of
they
ordered
their
men
to
fire
very
low
almost
without
sighting
in
order
to
profit
by
ricochets
fire
by
rank
is
a
fire
to
occupy
the
men
in
ranks
but
if
fire
at
will
is
not
effective
what
is
its
use
as
we
have
already
said
its
use
is
to
occupy
the
men
in
the
ranks
in
ordinary
fire
the
act
of
breathing
alone
by
the
movement
it
communicates
to
the
body
greatly
annoys
men
in
firing
how
then
can
it
be
claimed
that
on
the
field
of
battle
in
rank
men
can
fire
even
moderately
well
when
they
fire
only
to
soothe
themselves
and
forget
danger
napoleon
said
the
instinct
of
man
is
not
to
let
himself
be
killed
without
defending
himself
and
indeed
man
in
combat
is
a
being
in
whom
the
instinct
of
self
preservation
dominates
at
times
all
other
sentiments
the
object
of
discipline
is
to
dominate
this
instinct
by
a
greater
terror
of
shame
or
of
punishment
but
it
is
never
able
entirely
to
attain
this
object
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
it
is
not
effectual
this
point
reached
the
soldier
must
fire
or
he
will
go
either
forward
or
back
fire
is
then
let
us
say
a
safety
vent
for
excitement
in
serious
affairs
it
is
then
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
control
fire
here
is
an
example
given
by
marshal
saxe
charles
xii
king
of
sweden
wished
to
introduce
into
his
infantry
the
method
of
charging
with
the
bayonet
he
spoke
of
it
often
and
it
was
known
in
the
army
that
this
was
his
idea
finally
at
the
battle
of
against
the
russians
when
the
fighting
started
he
went
to
his
regiment
of
infantry
made
it
a
fine
speech
dismounted
before
the
colors
and
himself
led
the
regiment
to
the
charge
when
he
was
thirty
paces
from
the
enemy
the
whole
regiment
fired
in
spite
of
his
orders
and
his
presence
otherwise
it
did
very
well
and
broke
the
enemy
the
king
was
so
annoyed
that
all
he
did
was
pass
through
the
ranks
remount
his
horse
and
go
away
without
saying
a
word
so
that
if
the
soldier
is
not
made
to
fire
he
will
fire
anyway
to
distract
himself
and
forget
danger
the
fire
of
frederick
prussians
had
no
other
purpose
marshal
saxe
saw
this
the
speed
with
which
the
prussians
load
their
rifles
he
tells
us
is
advantageous
in
that
it
occupies
the
soldier
and
forbids
reflection
while
he
is
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
it
is
an
error
to
believe
that
the
five
last
victories
gained
by
the
nation
in
its
last
war
were
due
to
fire
it
has
been
noted
that
in
most
of
these
actions
there
were
more
prussians
killed
by
rifle
fire
than
there
were
of
their
enemies
it
would
be
sad
to
think
the
soldier
in
line
a
firing
machine
firing
has
been
and
always
will
be
his
principal
object
to
fire
as
many
shots
in
as
short
a
time
as
possible
but
the
victor
is
not
always
the
one
who
kills
the
most
he
is
fortunate
who
best
knows
how
to
overcome
the
morale
of
his
enemy
the
coolness
of
men
can
not
be
counted
on
and
as
it
is
necessary
above
all
to
keep
up
their
morale
one
ought
to
try
above
all
to
occupy
and
soothe
them
this
can
best
be
done
by
frequent
discharges
there
will
be
little
effect
and
it
would
be
absurd
to
expect
them
to
be
calm
enough
to
fire
slowly
adjust
their
ranges
and
above
all
sight
carefully
the
deadly
fire
is
the
fire
of
skirmishers
in
group
firing
when
the
men
are
grouped
into
platoons
or
battalions
all
weapons
have
the
same
value
and
if
it
is
assumed
that
fire
must
decide
engagements
the
method
of
fighting
must
be
adopted
which
gives
most
effect
to
the
weapon
this
is
the
employment
of
skirmishers
it
is
this
class
of
fire
indeed
which
is
deadliest
in
war
we
could
give
many
examples
but
we
shall
be
content
with
the
two
following
instances
taken
from
general
duhesme
a
french
officer
who
served
with
the
austrians
in
one
of
the
recent
wars
says
general
duhesme
told
me
that
from
the
fire
of
a
french
battalion
one
hundred
paces
from
them
his
company
lost
only
three
or
four
men
while
in
the
same
time
they
had
had
more
than
thirty
killed
or
wounded
by
the
fire
of
a
group
of
skirmishers
in
a
little
wood
on
their
flank
three
hundred
paces
away
at
the
passage
of
the
minico
in
the
battalion
of
the
received
the
fire
of
a
battalion
of
bussi
regiment
without
losing
a
man
the
skirmishers
of
that
same
organization
killed
more
than
thirty
men
in
a
few
minutes
while
protecting
the
retreat
of
their
organization
the
fire
of
skirmishers
is
then
the
most
deadly
used
in
war
because
the
few
men
who
remain
cool
enough
to
aim
are
not
otherwise
annoyed
while
employed
as
skirmishers
they
will
perform
better
as
they
are
better
hidden
and
better
trained
in
firing
the
accuracy
of
fire
giving
advantages
only
in
isolated
fire
we
may
consider
that
accurate
weapons
will
tend
to
make
fighting
by
skirmishers
more
frequent
and
more
decisive
for
the
rest
experience
authorizes
the
statement
that
the
use
of
skirmishers
is
compulsory
in
war
all
troops
seriously
engaged
become
in
an
instant
groups
of
skirmishers
and
the
only
possible
precise
fire
is
from
hidden
snipers
however
the
military
education
which
we
have
received
the
spirit
of
the
times
clouds
with
doubt
our
mind
regarding
this
method
of
fighting
by
skirmishers
we
accept
it
regretfully
our
personal
experience
being
incomplete
insufficient
we
content
ourselves
with
the
supposition
that
gives
us
satisfaction
the
war
of
skirmishers
no
matter
how
thoroughly
it
has
been
proven
out
is
accepted
by
constraint
because
we
are
forced
by
circumstance
to
engage
our
troops
by
degrees
in
spite
of
ourselves
often
unconsciously
but
be
it
understood
a
successive
engagement
is
necessary
in
war
however
let
us
not
have
illusions
as
to
the
efficacy
of
the
fire
of
skirmishers
in
spite
of
the
use
of
accurate
and
long
range
weapons
in
spite
of
all
training
that
can
be
given
the
soldier
this
fire
never
has
more
than
a
relative
effect
which
should
not
be
exaggerated
the
fire
of
skirmishers
is
generally
against
skirmishers
a
body
of
troops
indeed
does
not
let
itself
be
fired
on
by
skirmishers
without
returning
a
similar
fire
and
it
is
absurd
to
expect
skirmishers
to
direct
their
fire
on
a
body
protected
by
skirmishers
to
demand
of
troops
firing
individually
almost
abandoned
to
themselves
that
they
do
not
answer
the
shots
directed
at
them
by
near
skirmishers
but
aim
at
a
distant
body
which
is
not
harming
them
is
to
ask
an
impossible
unselfishness
as
skirmishers
men
are
very
scattered
to
watch
the
adjustment
of
ranges
is
difficult
men
are
practically
left
alone
those
who
remain
cool
may
try
to
adjust
their
range
but
it
is
first
necessary
to
see
where
your
shots
fall
then
if
the
terrain
permits
this
and
it
will
rarely
do
so
to
distinguish
them
from
shots
fired
at
the
same
time
by
your
neighbors
also
these
men
will
be
more
disturbed
will
fire
faster
and
less
accurately
as
the
fight
is
more
bitter
the
enemy
stauncher
and
perturbation
is
more
contagious
than
coolness
the
target
is
a
line
of
skirmishers
a
target
offering
so
little
breadth
and
above
all
depth
that
outside
of
point
blank
fire
an
exact
knowledge
of
the
range
is
necessary
to
secure
effect
this
is
impossible
for
the
range
varies
at
each
instant
with
the
movements
of
the
skirmishers
thus
with
skirmishers
against
skirmishers
there
are
scattered
shots
at
scattered
targets
our
fire
of
skirmishers
marching
on
the
target
range
proves
this
although
each
man
knows
exactly
the
range
and
has
time
and
the
coolness
to
set
his
sights
it
is
impossible
for
skirmishers
in
movement
to
set
sights
beyond
four
hundred
meters
and
this
is
pretty
extreme
even
though
the
weapon
is
actually
accurate
beyond
this
also
a
shot
is
born
there
are
men
above
all
in
officer
instructors
at
firing
schools
who
from
poor
shots
become
excellent
shots
after
years
of
practice
but
it
is
impossible
to
give
all
the
soldiers
such
an
education
without
an
enormous
consumption
of
ammunition
and
without
abandoning
all
other
work
and
then
there
would
be
no
results
with
half
of
them
to
sum
up
we
find
that
fire
is
effective
only
at
point
blank
even
in
our
last
wars
there
have
been
very
few
circumstances
in
which
men
who
were
favored
with
coolness
and
under
able
leadership
have
furnished
exceptions
with
these
exceptions
noted
we
can
say
that
accurate
and
long
range
weapons
have
not
given
any
real
effect
at
a
range
greater
than
point
blank
there
has
been
put
forward
as
proof
of
the
efficacy
of
accurate
weapons
the
terrible
and
decisive
results
obtained
by
the
british
in
india
with
the
enfield
rifle
but
these
results
have
been
obtained
because
the
british
faced
comparatively
poorly
armed
enemies
they
had
then
the
security
the
confidence
the
ensuing
coolness
necessary
for
the
use
of
accurate
weapons
these
conditions
are
completely
changed
when
one
faces
an
enemy
equally
well
armed
who
consequently
gives
as
good
as
he
gets
absolute
impossibility
of
fire
at
command
let
us
return
to
fire
at
command
which
there
is
a
tendency
to
have
troops
execute
in
line
can
regular
and
efficient
fire
be
hoped
for
from
troops
in
line
ought
it
to
be
hoped
for
no
for
man
can
not
be
made
over
and
neither
can
the
line
even
on
the
range
or
on
the
maneuver
field
what
does
this
fire
amount
to
in
fire
at
command
on
the
range
all
the
men
in
the
two
ranks
come
to
the
firing
position
simultaneously
everybody
is
perfectly
quiet
men
in
the
front
rank
consequently
are
not
deranged
by
their
neighbors
men
in
the
second
rank
are
in
the
same
situation
the
first
rank
being
set
and
motionless
they
can
aim
through
the
openings
without
more
annoyance
than
those
in
the
first
rank
fire
being
executed
at
command
simultaneously
no
weapon
is
deranged
at
the
moment
of
firing
by
the
movements
of
the
men
all
conditions
are
entirely
favorable
to
this
kind
of
fire
also
as
the
fire
is
ordered
with
skill
and
coolness
by
an
officer
who
has
perfectly
aligned
his
men
a
thing
rare
even
on
the
drill
ground
it
gives
percentage
results
greater
than
that
of
fire
at
will
executed
with
the
minutest
precautions
results
that
are
sometimes
astonishing
but
fire
at
command
from
the
extreme
coolness
that
it
demands
of
all
of
the
officer
certainly
more
than
of
the
soldier
is
impracticable
before
the
enemy
except
under
exceptional
circumstances
of
picked
officers
picked
men
ground
distance
safety
etc
even
in
maneuvers
its
execution
is
farcical
there
is
not
an
organization
in
which
the
soldiers
do
not
hurry
the
command
to
fire
in
that
the
officers
are
so
afraid
that
their
men
will
anticipate
the
command
that
they
give
it
as
rapidly
as
possible
while
the
pieces
are
hardly
in
firing
position
often
while
they
are
still
in
motion
the
prescription
that
the
command
to
fire
be
not
given
until
about
three
seconds
after
coming
to
the
firing
position
may
give
good
results
in
the
face
of
range
targets
but
it
is
not
wise
to
believe
that
men
will
wait
thus
for
long
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
it
is
useless
to
speak
of
the
use
of
the
before
the
enemy
in
fire
attempted
by
the
same
officers
and
men
who
are
so
utterly
lacking
even
on
the
maneuver
ground
we
have
seen
a
firing
instructor
an
officer
of
coolness
and
assurance
who
on
the
range
had
fired
trial
shots
every
day
for
a
month
after
this
month
of
daily
practice
fire
four
trial
shots
at
a
six
hundred
meter
range
with
the
sight
leaf
at
point
blank
let
us
not
pay
too
much
attention
to
those
who
in
military
matters
base
everything
on
the
weapon
and
unhesitating
assume
that
the
man
serving
it
will
adopt
the
usage
provided
and
ordered
in
their
regulations
the
fighting
man
is
flesh
and
blood
he
is
both
body
and
soul
and
strong
as
the
soul
may
often
be
it
can
not
so
dominate
the
body
that
there
is
no
revolt
of
the
flesh
no
mental
disturbance
in
the
face
of
destruction
let
us
learn
to
distrust
mathematics
and
material
dynamics
as
applied
to
battle
principles
we
shall
learn
to
beware
of
the
illusions
drawn
from
the
range
and
the
maneuver
field
there
experience
is
with
the
calm
settled
unfatigued
attentive
obedient
soldier
with
an
intelligent
and
tractable
man
instrument
in
short
and
not
with
the
nervous
easily
swayed
moved
troubled
distrait
excited
restless
being
not
even
under
who
is
the
fighting
man
from
general
to
private
there
are
strong
men
exceptions
but
they
are
rare
these
illusions
nevertheless
stubborn
and
persistent
always
repair
the
next
day
the
most
damaging
injuries
inflicted
on
them
by
reality
their
least
dangerous
effect
is
to
lead
to
prescribing
the
impracticable
as
if
ordering
the
impracticable
were
not
really
an
attack
on
discipline
and
did
not
result
in
disconcerting
officers
and
men
by
the
unexpected
and
by
surprise
at
the
contrast
between
battle
and
the
theories
of
training
battle
of
course
always
furnishes
surprises
but
it
furnishes
less
in
proportion
as
good
sense
and
the
recognition
of
the
truth
have
had
their
effect
on
the
training
of
the
fighting
man
man
in
the
mass
in
a
disciplined
body
organized
for
combat
is
invincible
before
an
undisciplined
body
but
against
a
similarly
disciplined
body
he
reverts
to
the
primitive
man
who
flees
before
a
force
that
is
proved
stronger
or
that
he
feels
stronger
the
heart
of
the
soldier
is
always
the
human
heart
discipline
holds
enemies
face
to
face
a
little
longer
but
the
instinct
of
maintains
its
empire
and
with
it
the
sense
of
fear
fear
there
are
chiefs
there
are
soldiers
who
know
no
fear
but
they
are
of
rare
temper
the
mass
trembles
for
the
flesh
can
not
be
suppressed
and
this
trembling
must
be
taken
into
account
in
all
organization
discipline
formation
maneuver
movement
methods
of
action
for
in
all
of
these
the
soldier
tends
to
be
upset
to
be
deceived
to
himself
and
to
exaggerate
the
offensive
spirit
of
the
enemy
on
the
field
of
battle
death
is
in
the
air
blind
and
invisible
making
his
presence
known
by
fearful
whistlings
that
make
heads
duck
during
this
strain
the
recruit
hunches
up
closes
in
seeking
aid
by
an
instinctive
unformulated
reasoning
he
figures
that
the
more
there
are
to
face
a
danger
the
greater
each
one
chances
of
escaping
but
he
soon
sees
that
flesh
attracts
lead
then
possessed
by
terror
inevitably
he
retreats
before
the
fire
or
he
escapes
by
advancing
in
the
picturesque
and
profound
words
of
general
burbaki
the
soldier
escapes
from
his
officer
we
say
yes
he
escapes
but
is
it
not
evident
that
he
escapes
because
up
to
this
moment
nobody
has
bothered
about
his
character
his
temperament
the
impressionable
and
exciteable
nature
of
man
in
prescribed
methods
of
fighting
he
has
always
been
held
to
impossibilities
the
same
thing
is
done
as
yesterday
he
will
escape
there
is
of
course
a
time
when
all
the
soldiers
escape
either
forward
or
to
the
rear
but
the
organization
the
combat
methods
should
have
no
other
object
than
to
delay
as
long
as
possible
this
crisis
yet
they
hasten
it
all
our
officers
fear
quite
justifiably
from
their
experience
that
the
soldier
will
too
rapidly
use
his
cartridges
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
this
serious
matter
is
certainly
worthy
of
attention
how
to
stop
this
useless
and
dangerous
waste
of
ammunition
is
the
question
our
soldiers
show
little
coolness
once
in
danger
they
fire
fire
to
calm
themselves
to
pass
the
time
they
can
not
be
stopped
there
are
some
people
you
can
not
embarrass
with
the
best
faith
in
the
world
they
say
what
is
this
you
are
troubled
about
stopping
the
fire
of
your
soldiers
that
is
not
difficult
you
find
that
they
show
little
coolness
and
shoot
despite
their
officers
in
spite
even
of
themselves
all
right
require
of
them
and
their
officers
methods
of
fire
that
demand
extremes
of
coolness
calm
and
assurance
even
in
maneuver
they
can
not
give
a
little
ask
a
lot
and
you
will
get
it
there
you
have
a
combat
method
nobody
has
ever
heard
of
simple
beautiful
and
terrible
this
is
indeed
a
fine
theory
it
would
make
the
wily
frederick
who
surely
did
not
believe
in
these
maneuvers
laugh
until
he
cried
this
is
to
escape
from
a
difficulty
by
a
means
always
recognized
as
impossible
and
more
impossible
than
ever
fearing
that
the
soldier
will
escape
from
command
can
not
better
means
be
found
to
hold
him
than
to
require
of
him
and
his
officer
impracticable
fire
this
ordered
and
not
executed
by
the
soldiers
and
even
by
the
officers
is
an
attack
on
the
discipline
of
the
unit
never
order
the
impossible
says
discipline
for
the
impossible
becomes
then
a
disobedience
how
many
requisites
there
are
to
make
fire
at
command
possible
conditions
among
the
soldiers
among
their
officers
perfect
these
conditions
they
say
all
right
perfect
their
training
their
discipline
etc
but
to
obtain
fire
at
command
it
is
necessary
to
perfect
their
nerves
their
physical
force
their
moral
force
to
make
bronze
images
of
them
to
do
away
with
excitement
with
the
trembling
of
the
flesh
can
any
one
do
this
frederick
soldiers
were
brought
by
blows
of
the
baton
to
a
terrible
state
of
discipline
yet
their
fire
was
fire
at
will
discipline
had
reached
its
limits
man
in
battle
let
us
repeat
again
is
a
being
to
whom
the
instinct
of
at
times
dominates
everything
else
discipline
whose
purpose
is
to
dominate
this
instinct
by
a
feeling
of
greater
terror
can
not
wholly
achieve
it
discipline
goes
so
far
and
no
farther
we
can
not
deny
the
existence
of
extraordinary
instances
when
discipline
and
devotion
have
raised
man
above
himself
but
these
examples
are
extraordinary
rare
they
are
admired
as
exceptions
and
the
exception
proves
the
rule
as
to
perfection
consider
the
spartans
if
man
was
ever
perfected
for
war
it
was
he
and
yet
he
has
been
beaten
and
fled
in
spite
of
training
moral
and
physical
force
has
limits
the
spartans
who
should
have
stayed
to
the
last
man
on
the
battle
field
fled
the
british
with
their
phlegmatic
coolness
and
their
terrible
rolling
fire
the
russians
with
that
inertia
that
is
called
their
tenacity
have
given
way
before
attack
the
german
has
given
way
he
who
on
account
of
his
subordination
and
stability
has
been
called
excellent
war
material
again
an
objection
is
raised
perhaps
with
recruits
the
method
may
be
impracticable
but
with
veterans
but
with
whom
is
war
commenced
methods
are
devised
precisely
for
young
and
inexperienced
troops
they
ask
also
if
the
prussians
used
this
method
of
fire
successfully
in
the
last
war
why
should
not
we
do
as
well
supposing
that
the
prussians
actually
did
use
it
and
this
is
far
from
being
proved
it
does
not
follow
that
it
is
practicable
for
us
this
mania
for
borrowing
german
tactics
is
not
new
although
it
has
always
been
properly
protested
against
marshal
luchner
said
no
matter
how
much
they
torment
their
men
fortunately
they
will
never
make
them
prussians
later
de
said
the
men
are
drilled
in
various
exercises
believed
necessary
to
fit
them
for
war
but
there
is
no
question
of
adopting
exercises
to
suit
the
french
military
genius
the
french
character
and
temperament
it
has
not
been
thought
necessary
to
take
this
into
account
it
has
been
easier
to
borrow
german
methods
to
follow
preconceived
tactics
is
more
the
part
of
the
phlegmatic
german
than
it
is
ours
the
germans
obey
well
enough
but
the
point
is
that
they
try
to
follow
tactics
which
are
contrary
to
nature
the
frenchman
can
not
more
spontaneous
more
exciteable
and
impressionable
less
calm
and
obedient
he
has
in
our
last
wars
promptly
and
completely
violated
both
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
regulations
the
german
said
a
prussian
officer
has
sentiments
of
duty
and
obedience
he
submits
to
severe
discipline
he
is
full
of
devotion
although
not
animated
by
a
lively
mind
easy
by
nature
rather
heavy
than
active
intellectually
calm
reflective
without
dash
or
divine
fire
wishing
but
not
mad
to
conquer
obeying
calmly
and
conscientiously
but
mechanically
and
without
enthusiasm
fighting
with
a
resigned
valor
with
heroism
he
may
let
himself
be
sacrificed
uselessly
but
he
sells
his
life
dearly
without
warlike
tendencies
not
bellicose
unambitious
he
is
yet
excellent
war
material
on
account
of
his
subordination
and
stability
what
must
be
inculcated
in
him
is
a
will
of
his
own
a
personal
impulse
to
send
him
forward
according
to
this
unflattering
portrait
which
we
believe
a
little
extreme
even
if
by
a
compatriot
it
is
possible
that
the
germans
can
be
handled
in
tactics
impossible
with
french
however
did
they
actually
use
these
tactics
remember
the
urgent
warning
of
blücher
to
his
brigade
commanders
not
to
let
bayonet
attacks
break
down
into
fusillades
note
the
article
in
the
present
prussian
firing
regulations
which
prescribes
trial
shots
before
each
fire
delivered
so
as
to
dissipate
the
kind
of
excitement
that
possesses
the
soldier
when
his
drill
has
been
interrupted
for
some
time
in
conclusion
if
fire
at
command
was
impossible
with
the
ancient
rifle
it
is
more
so
for
the
simple
reason
that
trembling
increases
as
the
destructive
power
increases
under
turenne
lines
held
longer
than
because
the
musket
was
in
use
and
the
battle
developed
more
slowly
when
every
one
has
the
rapid
fire
rifle
are
things
easier
alas
no
relations
between
weapons
and
the
man
are
the
same
you
give
me
a
musket
i
fire
at
sixty
paces
a
rifle
at
two
hundred
a
chessepot
at
four
hundred
but
i
have
perhaps
less
coolness
and
steadiness
than
at
the
old
sixty
paces
for
with
the
rapidity
of
fire
the
new
weapon
is
more
terrible
at
four
hundred
paces
for
me
as
well
as
for
the
enemy
than
was
the
musket
at
sixty
paces
and
is
there
even
more
fire
accuracy
no
rifles
were
used
before
the
french
revolution
and
yet
this
perfectly
well
known
weapon
was
very
rarely
seen
in
war
and
its
efficacy
as
shown
in
those
rare
cases
was
unsatisfactory
accurate
fire
with
it
at
combat
distances
of
from
two
hundred
to
four
hundred
meters
was
illusory
and
it
was
abandoned
in
favor
of
the
old
rifle
did
the
foot
chasseurs
know
fire
at
command
picked
troops
dependable
did
they
use
it
yet
it
would
have
been
a
fine
method
of
employing
their
weapons
we
have
weapons
that
are
accurate
at
six
hundred
to
seven
hundred
meters
does
that
mean
that
accurate
fire
at
seven
hundred
meters
is
possible
no
if
your
enemy
is
armed
as
we
are
fire
at
seven
hundred
meters
will
show
the
same
results
that
have
been
shown
for
four
hundred
meters
the
same
losses
will
be
suffered
and
the
coolness
shown
will
be
the
same
that
is
it
will
be
absent
if
one
fire
three
times
as
fast
three
times
as
many
men
will
fall
and
it
will
be
three
times
as
difficult
to
preserve
coolness
just
as
formerly
it
was
impossible
to
execute
fire
at
command
so
it
is
formerly
no
was
possible
it
is
no
better
but
if
this
fire
is
impossible
why
attempt
it
let
us
remain
always
in
the
realm
of
the
possible
or
we
shall
make
sad
mistakes
in
our
art
said
general
daine
theorists
abound
practical
men
are
very
rare
also
when
the
moment
of
action
arrives
principles
are
often
found
to
be
confused
application
impossible
and
the
most
erudite
officers
remain
inactive
unable
to
use
the
scientific
treasures
that
they
have
amassed
let
us
then
practical
men
seek
for
possible
methods
let
us
gather
carefully
the
lessons
of
their

an

the

this

nowhere

where

even
the

when
two

which
usually
each
goes
cautiously

until
the
critical
part
of
the

or
having
commenced
as
usual
the
opposite
is
done
and
one
moves
swiftly
after
the

either
to

to

this
is
the
method
by
which

can
with

possible
risk
most

the

charging
at

and

five
of
the

and

extract
from
plutarch
life
of
marius
boiorix
king
of
the
cimbrians
at
the
head
of
a
small
troop
of
cavalry
approached
marius
camp
and
challenged
him
to
fix
a
day
and
place
to
decide
who
would
rule
the
country
marius
answered
that
romans
did
not
ask
their
enemies
when
to
fight
but
that
he
was
willing
to
satisfy
the
cimbrians
they
agreed
then
to
give
battle
in
three
days
on
the
plain
of
verceil
a
convenient
place
for
the
romans
to
deploy
their
cavalry
and
for
the
barbarians
to
extend
their
large
army
the
two
opponents
on
the
day
set
were
in
battle
formation
catulus
had
twenty
thousand
three
hundred
men
marius
had
thousand
placed
on
the
wings
and
consequently
on
either
side
of
those
of
catulus
in
the
center
so
writes
sylla
who
was
there
they
say
that
marius
gave
this
disposition
to
the
two
parts
of
his
army
because
he
hoped
to
fall
with
his
two
wings
on
the
barbarian
phalanxes
and
wished
the
victory
to
come
only
to
his
command
without
catulus
taking
any
part
or
even
meeting
with
the
enemy
indeed
as
the
front
of
battle
was
very
broad
the
wings
were
separated
from
the
center
which
was
broken
through
they
add
that
catulus
reported
this
disposition
in
the
explanation
that
he
had
to
make
and
complained
bitterly
of
bad
faith
the
cimbrian
infantry
came
out
of
its
positions
in
good
order
and
in
battle
array
formed
a
solid
phalanx
as
broad
as
it
was
wide
thirty
stades
or
about
eighteen
thousand
feet
their
fifteen
thousand
horsemen
were
magnificently
equipped
their
helmets
were
crowned
by
the
gaping
mouths
of
savage
beasts
above
which
were
high
plumes
which
looked
like
wings
this
accentuated
their
height
they
were
protected
by
iron
cuirasses
and
had
shields
of
an
astonishing
whiteness
each
had
two
javelins
to
throw
from
a
distance
and
in
close
fighting
they
used
a
long
heavy
sword
in
this
battle
the
cavalry
did
not
attack
the
romans
in
front
but
turning
to
the
right
they
gradually
extended
with
the
idea
of
enclosing
the
romans
before
their
infantry
and
themselves
the
roman
generals
instantly
perceived
the
ruse
but
they
were
not
able
to
restrain
their
men
one
of
whom
shouting
that
the
enemy
was
flying
led
all
the
others
to
pursue
meanwhile
the
barbarian
infantry
advanced
like
the
waves
of
a
great
sea
marius
washed
his
hands
raised
them
to
heaven
and
vowed
to
offer
a
hecatomb
to
the
gods
catulus
for
his
part
also
raised
his
hands
to
heaven
and
promised
to
consecrate
the
fortune
of
the
day
marius
also
made
a
sacrifice
and
when
the
priest
showed
him
the
entrails
cried
is
mine
but
as
the
two
armies
were
set
in
motion
something
happened
which
according
to
sylla
seemed
divine
vengeance
on
marius
the
movements
of
such
a
prodigious
multitude
raised
such
a
cloud
of
dust
that
the
two
armies
could
not
see
each
other
marius
who
had
advanced
first
with
his
troops
to
fall
on
the
enemy
formation
missed
it
in
the
dust
and
having
passed
beyond
it
wandered
for
a
long
time
in
the
plain
meanwhile
fortune
turned
the
barbarians
toward
catulus
who
had
to
meet
their
whole
attack
with
his
soldiers
among
whom
was
sylla
the
heat
of
the
day
and
the
burning
rays
of
the
sun
which
was
in
the
eyes
of
the
cimbrians
helped
the
romans
the
barbarians
reared
in
cold
wooded
places
hardened
to
extreme
cold
could
not
stand
the
heat
sweating
panting
they
shaded
their
faces
from
the
sun
with
their
shields
the
battle
occurred
after
the
summer
solstice
three
days
before
the
new
moon
of
the
month
of
august
then
called
sextilis
the
cloud
of
dust
sustained
the
courage
by
concealing
the
number
of
the
enemy
each
battalion
advancing
against
the
enemy
in
front
of
them
were
engaged
before
the
sight
of
such
a
great
horde
of
barbarians
could
shake
them
furthermore
hardship
and
hard
work
had
so
toughened
them
that
in
spite
of
the
heat
and
impetuousness
with
which
they
attacked
no
roman
was
seen
to
sweat
or
pant
this
it
is
said
is
testified
to
by
catulus
himself
in
eulogizing
the
conduct
of
his
troops
most
of
the
enemy
above
all
the
bravest
were
cut
to
pieces
for
to
keep
the
front
ranks
from
breaking
they
were
tied
together
by
long
chains
attached
to
their
belts
the
victors
pursued
the
fugitives
to
their
entrenched
camp
the
romans
took
more
than
sixty
thousand
cimbrians
prisoners
and
killed
twice
as
many
the
battle
of
the
alma
extract
from
the
correspondence
of
colonel
ardant
du
picq
a
letter
sent
from
huy
february
by
captain
de
v
a
company
officer
in
the
attack
division
my
company
with
the
commanded
by
captain
d
was
designated
to
cover
the
battalion
at
eight
or
nine
hundred
meters
from
the
alma
we
saw
a
sort
of
wall
crowned
with
white
whose
use
we
could
not
understand
then
at
not
more
than
three
hundred
meters
this
wall
delivered
against
us
a
lively
battalion
fire
and
deployed
at
the
run
it
was
a
russian
battalion
whose
uniform
or
color
with
white
helmet
had
with
the
help
of
a
bright
sun
produced
the
illusion
this
parenthetically
showed
me
that
this
color
is
certainly
the
most
sensible
as
it
can
cause
such
errors
we
replied
actively
but
there
was
effect
on
neither
side
because
the
men
fired
too
fast
and
too
high
the
advance
was
then
taken
up
and
i
know
from
whom
the
order
can
have
come
we
went
on
the
run
crossing
the
river
easily
enough
and
while
we
were
assembling
to
scramble
up
the
hill
we
saw
the
rest
of
the
battalion
attacking
without
order
companies
mixed
up
crying
singing
etc
we
did
the
same
again
took
up
the
attack
and
were
lucky
enough
to
reach
the
summit
of
the
plateau
first
the
russians
astounded
massed
in
a
square
why
i
suppose
that
turned
on
the
left
attacked
in
the
center
they
thought
themselves
surrounded
and
took
this
strange
formation
at
this
moment
a
most
inopportune
bugle
call
was
sounded
by
order
of
major
de
m
commanding
temporarily
a
battalion
of
foot
chasseurs
this
officer
had
perceived
the
russian
cavalry
in
motion
and
believed
that
its
object
was
to
charge
us
while
on
the
contrary
it
was
maneuvering
to
escape
the
shells
fired
into
it
while
in
squadron
formation
by
the
megere
a
vessel
of
the
fleet
this
order
given
by
bugle
signal
was
executed
as
rapidly
as
had
been
the
attack
such
is
the
instinct
of
which
urges
man
to
flee
danger
above
all
when
ordered
to
flee
happily
a
officer
captain
daguerre
seeing
the
gross
mistake
commanded
in
a
stentorian
tone
this
halted
the
retreat
and
caused
us
again
to
take
up
the
attack
the
attack
made
us
masters
of
the
and
the
battle
was
won
at
this
second
charge
the
russians
gave
turned
and
hardly
any
of
them
were
wounded
with
the
bayonet
so
then
a
major
commanding
a
battalion
without
orders
sounds
a
bugle
call
and
endangers
success
a
simple
captain
commands
and
decides
the
victory
this
is
the
history
of
yesterday
which
may
be
useful
tomorrow
it
appears
from
this
that
apart
from
the
able
conception
of
the
the
detail
of
execution
was
abominable
and
that
to
base
on
successes
new
rules
of
battle
would
lead
to
lamentable
errors
let
us
sum
up
first
a
private
chasseur
gave
the
order
to
attack
second
the
troops
went
to
the
attack
mixed
up
with
each
other
we
needed
nearly
an
hour
merely
to
reform
the
brigade
this
one
called
that
one
congratulated
himself
the
superior
officers
cried
out
etc
there
was
confusion
that
would
have
meant
disaster
if
the
cavalry
charge
which
was
believed
to
threaten
us
had
been
executed
disorder
broke
out
in
the
companies
at
the
first
shot
once
engaged
commanders
of
organizations
no
longer
had
them
in
hand
and
they
intermingled
so
that
it
was
not
easy
to
locate
oneself
third
there
was
no
silence
in
ranks
officers
officers
and
soldiers
commanded
shouted
etc
the
bugles
sounded
the
commands
they
heard
coming
from
nobody
knew
where
fourth
there
was
no
maneuvering
from
the
first
shot
to
the
last
i
do
not
remember
being
among
my
own
men
it
was
only
at
the
end
that
we
found
each
other
zouaves
chasseurs
soldiers
of
the
line
formed
an
attack
group
that
was
all
about
four
there
was
a
first
roll
call
about
a
third
of
the
battalion
was
missing
at
nine
at
night
there
was
a
second
roll
call
only
about
fifty
men
were
missing
thirty
of
whom
were
wounded
where
the
rest
were
i
do
not
know
fifth
to
lighten
the
men
packs
had
been
left
on
the
plain
at
the
moment
fire
opened
and
as
the
operation
had
not
been
worked
out
in
advance
no
measures
were
taken
to
guard
them
in
the
evening
most
of
the
men
found
their
packs
incomplete
lacking
all
the
little
indispensables
that
one
can
not
get
in
the
position
in
which
we
were
it
is
evidently
a
vital
necessity
to
restrain
the
individual
initiative
of
subordinates
and
leave
command
to
the
chiefs
and
above
all
to
watch
the
training
of
the
soldiers
who
are
always
ready
as
they
approach
to
run
on
the
enemy
with
the
bayonet
i
have
always
noted
that
if
a
body

i
shall
tell
you
something
notable
that
i
saw
at

talk
a
lot
of
the
bayonet
for
my
part
i
only
saw
it
used
once
in
the
night
in
a
trench
also
it
is
noted
that
in
the
hospital
practically
all
the
wounds
treated
were
from
fire
rarely
from

hardly
arrived
close
to
the

when
it
received
a
new
order
to
rush
to
the
help
of
the
english
army
which
too
weak
to
hold
such
a
large
army
had
been
broken
in
the
center
of
its
line
and
driven
back
on

the

the
honor
to
arrive
first
in

after
moving
three
kilometers
on

received
by
the

then
carried

we

did
we
fall

before
the
active
reaction
of

or
merely
because
after
the
first
shock
the
isolated
soldiers
fell
back
to
find
companions

the
battle
of
magenta
extract
from
the
correspondence
of
colonel
ardant
du
picq
letters
from
captain
c
dated
august
at
magenta
i
was
in
espinasse
division
of
marshal
corps
this
division
was
on
the
extreme
left
of
the
troops
that
had
passed
the
ticino
at
turbigo
and
was
moving
on
magenta
by
the
left
bank
close
to
the
village
a
fusillade
at
close
range
apprised
us
that
the
enemy
was
before
us
the
country
covered
with
trees
hedges
and
vines
had
hidden
them
our
battalion
and
the
foreign
regiment
drove
the
austrians
into
magenta
meanwhile
the
and
battalions
of
zouaves
with
which
i
was
remained
in
reserve
arms
stacked
under
control
of
the
division
commander
apparently
quite
an
interval
had
been
left
between
espinasse
division
and
la
motterouge
the
of
the
corps
and
at
the
moment
of
engagement
at
least
an
austrian
brigade
had
entered
the
gap
and
had
taken
in
flank
and
rear
the
elements
of
our
division
engaged
before
magenta
happily
the
wooded
country
concealed
the
situation
or
i
doubt
whether
our
troops
engaged
would
have
held
on
as
they
did
at
any
rate
the
two
reserve
battalions
had
not
moved
the
fusillade
extended
to
our
right
and
left
as
if
to
surround
us
bullets
already
came
from
our
right
flank
the
general
had
put
five
guns
in
front
of
us
to
fire
on
the
village
and
at
the
same
time
i
received
the
order
to
move
my
section
to
the
right
to
drive
off
the
invisible
enemy
who
was
firing
on
us
i
remember
that
i
had
quit
the
column
with
my
section
when
i
saw
a
frightened
artillery
captain
run
toward
us
crying
general
we
are
losing
a
piece
the
general
answered
zouaves
packs
off
at
these
words
the
two
battalions
leaped
forward
like
a
flock
of
sheep
dropping
packs
everywhere
the
austrians
were
not
seen
at
first
it
was
only
after
advancing
for
an
instant
that
they
were
seen
they
were
already
dragging
off
the
piece
that
they
had
taken
at
the
sight
of
them
our
men
gave
a
yell
and
fell
on
them
surprise
and
terror
so
possessed
the
austrians
who
did
not
know
that
we
were
so
near
that
they
ran
without
using
their
arms
the
piece
was
retaken
the
regimental
standard
was
captured
by
a
man
in
my
company
about
two
hundred
prisoners
were
taken
and
the
austrian
regiment
hartmann
infantry
was
dispersed
like
sheep
in
flight
five
battalions
of
them
i
believe
that
had
the
country
not
been
thick
the
result
might
have
been
different
the
incident
lasted
perhaps
ten
minutes
the
two
battalions
took
up
their
first
position
they
had
had
no
losses
and
their
morale
was
in
the
clouds
after
about
an
hour
general
espinasse
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
two
battalions
and
marched
us
on
the
village
we
were
in
column
of
platoons
with
section
intervals
the
advance
was
made
by
echelon
the
battalion
in
front
the
a
little
in
rear
and
a
company
in
front
deployed
as
skirmishers
at
one
hundred
and
fifty
paces
from
the
austrians
wavering
was
evident
in
their
lines
the
first
ranks
threw
themselves
back
on
those
in
rear
at
that
instant
the
general
ordered
again
packs
off
at
the
double
everybody
ran
forward
shedding
his
pack
where
he
was
the
austrians
did
not
wait
for
us
we
entered
the
village
mixed
up
with
them
the
fighting
in
houses
lasted
quite
a
while
most
of
the
austrians
retired
those
who
remained
in
the
houses
had
to
surrender
i
found
myself
with
some
fifty
officers
and
men
in
a
big
house
from
which
we
took
four
hundred
men
and
five
officers
colonel
hauser
for
one
my
opinion
is
that
we
were
very
lucky
at
magenta
the
thick
country
in
which
we
fought
favored
us
in
hiding
our
inferior
number
from
the
austrians
i
do
not
believe
we
would
have
succeeded
so
well
in
open
country
in
the
gun
episode
the
austrians
were
surprised
stunned
those
whom
we
took
kept
their
arms
in
their
hands
without
either
abandoning
them
or
using
them
it
was
a
typical
zouave
attack
which
when
it
succeeds
has
astonishing
results
but
if
one
is
not
lucky
it
sometimes
costs
dearly
note
the
zouaves
at
palestro
the
zouaves
at
marignano
general
espinasse
advance
on
the
village
at
the
head
of
two
battalions
was
the
finest
and
most
imposing
sight
i
have
ever
seen
apart
from
that
advance
the
fighting
was
always
by
skirmishers
and
in
large
groups
the
battle
of
solferino
extract
from
the
correspondence
of
colonel
ardant
du
picq
letters
from
captain
c
the
infantry
was
part
of
the
division
of
the
corps
coming
out
of
medole
the
regiment
was
halted
on
the
right
of
the
road
and
formed
as
each
company
arrived
in
close
column
fascines
were
made
an
came
up
and
gave
an
order
to
the
colonel
the
regiment
was
then
put
on
the
road
marched
some
yards
and
formed
in
battalion
masses
on
the
right
of
the
line
of
battle
this
movement
was
executed
very
regularly
although
bullets
commenced
to
find
us
arms
were
rested
and
we
stayed
there
exposed
to
fire
without
doing
anything
not
even
sending
out
a
skirmisher
for
that
matter
during
the
whole
campaign
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
skirmisher
school
might
never
have
existed
then
up
came
a
major
of
engineers
from
general
niel
to
get
a
battalion
from
the
regiment
the
battalion
being
on
the
left
received
the
order
to
march
the
major
commanding
ordered
the
left
flank
and
we
marched
by
the
flank
in
close
column
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
up
to
farm
i
believe
where
general
niel
was
the
battalion
halted
a
moment
faced
to
the
front
and
closed
a
little
here
said
general
niel
are
my
only
reserve
then
the
general
glancing
in
front
of
the
farm
said
to
the
major
after
one
or
two
minutes
fix
bayonets
sound
the
charge
and
forward
this
last
movement
was
still
properly
executed
at
the
start
and
for
about
one
hundred
yards
of
advance
shrapnel
annoyed
the
battalion
and
the
men
shouldered
arms
to
march
better
at
about
one
hundred
yards
from
the
farm
the
cry
down
came
from
i
do
not
know
where
the
cry
was
instantly
repeated
in
the
battalion
packs
were
thrown
down
anywhere
and
with
wild
yells
the
advance
was
renewed
in
the
wildest
disorder
from
that
moment
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
battalion
as
a
unit
disappeared
toward
the
end
of
the
day
after
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
get
the
regiment
together
and
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
of
backing
and
filling
there
was
a
the
third
company
of
grenadiers
had
on
starting
off
in
the
morning
one
hundred
and
to
one
hundred
and
present
at
this
first
answered
a
number
i
can
swear
to
but
many
of
the
men
were
still
hunting
packs
and
rations
the
next
day
at
reveille
or
four
answered
many
came
back
in
the
night
this
was
the
strength
for
many
days
i
still
remember
for
i
was
charged
with
company
supply
from
june
as
additional
bit
of
information
it
was
generally
known
a
few
days
later
that
at
least
twenty
men
of
the
company
of
grenadiers
were
never
on
the
field
of
battle
wounded
of
the
company
returned
for
transport
to
medole
said
later
that
they
had
seen
some
twenty
of
the
company
together
close
to
medole
lying
in
the
grass
while
their
comrades
fought
they
even
gave
some
names
but
could
not
name
them
all
the
company
had
only
been
formed
for
the
war
on
april
and
had
received
that
same
day
new
grenadiers
and
at
milan
which
made
recruits
in
two
months
none
of
these
men
were
tried
or
punished
their
comrades
rode
them
hard

was

extract
from
the
correspondence
of
colonel
ardant
du
picq
letters
from
captain
c
dated
august
november
at
two
in
the
morning
we
took
up
arms
to
go
to
we
did
not
yet
know
that
we
would
meet
the
garibaldians
at
mentana
the
papal
army
had
about
three
thousand
men
we
about
two
thousand
five
hundred
at
one
the
papal
forces
met
their
enemies
the
zouaves
attacked
vigorously
but
the
first
engagements
were
without
great
losses
on
either
side
there
is
nothing
particular
in
this
first
episode
the
usual
thing
happened
a
force
advances
and
is
not
halted
by
the
fire
of
its
adversary
who
ends
by
showing
his
heels
the
papal
zouaves
are
marked
by
no
ordinary
spirit
in
comparing
them
with
the
soldiers
of
the
antibes
legion
one
is
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
man
who
fights
for
an
idea
fights
better
than
one
who
fights
for
money
at
each
advance
of
the
papal
forces
we
advanced
also
we
were
not
greatly
concerned
about
the
fight
we
hardly
thought
that
we
would
have
to
participate
not
dreaming
that
we
could
be
held
by
the
volunteers
however
that
did
not
happen
it
was
about
three
at
that
time
three
companies
of
the
battalion
were
employed
in
protecting
the
artillery
three
or
four
pieces
placed
about
the
the
head
of
the
french
column
was
then
formed
by
the
last
three
companies
of
the
battalion
one
of
the
line
regiment
the
other
regiments
were
immediately
behind
colonel
fremont
of
the
line
regiment
after
having
studied
the
took
two
chasseur
companies
followed
by
a
battalion
of
his
regiment
and
bore
to
the
right
to
turn
the
village
meanwhile
the
line
regiment
moved
further
to
the
right
in
the
direction
of
against
which
at
two
different
times
it
opened
a
fire
at
will
which
seemed
a
veritable
hurricane
due
to
the
distance
or
to
the
terrain
the
material
result
of
the
fire
seemed
to
be
negligible
the
moral
result
must
have
been
considerable
it
precipitated
a
flood
of
fugitives
on
the
road
from
mentana
to
dominated
by
our
sharpshooters
who
opened
on
the
fugitives
a
fire
more
deadly
than
that
of
the
chassepots
we
stayed
in
the
same
position
until
night
when
we
retired
to
a
position
near
mentana
where
we
bivouacked
my
company
was
one
of
the
two
chasseur
companies
which
attacked
on
the
right
with
the
line
regiment
my
company
had
rifles
we
had
not
yet
received
the
chassepots
it
forced
the
volunteers
from
solidly
held
positions
where
they
left
a
gun
and
a
considerable
number
of
rifles
in
addition
it
put
nearly
seventy
men
out
of
action
judging
by
those
who
remained
on
the
field
it
had
one
man
slightly
wounded
a
belt
and
a
carbine
broken
by
bullets
there
remained
with
the
general
after
our
movement
to
the
right
three
companies
of
chasseurs
a
battalion
of
the
and
three
of
the
i
do
not
include
many
elements
of
the
papal
army
which
had
not
been
engaged
some
of
my
comrades
told
me
of
having
been
engaged
with
a
chasseur
company
of
the
in
a
sunken
road
whose
sides
had
not
been
occupied
the
general
was
with
this
column
having
arrived
close
to
the
village
some
shots
either
from
the
houses
or
from
enemy
sharpshooters
who
might
easily
have
gotten
on
the
undefended
flanks
provoked
a
terrible
fusillade
in
the
column
in
spite
of
the
orders
and
efforts
of
the
officers
everybody
fired
at
the
risk
of
killing
each
other
and
this
probably
happened
it
was
only
when
some
men
led
by
officers
were
able
to
climb
the
sides
of
the
road
that
this
firing
ceased
i
do
not
think
that
this
was
a
well
understood
use
of
new
arms
the
fusillade
of
the
line
regiment
against
was
not
very
effective
i
believe
negligible
i
do
not
refer
to
the
moral
result
which
was
great
the
garibaldians
were
numerous
about
but
the
terrain
like
all
that
around
italian
villages
was
covered
with
trees
hedges
etc
under
these
conditions
i
believe
that
the
fire
of
sharpshooters
would
have
been
more
effective
than
volleys
where
the
men
estimate
distances
