what
was
known
of
captain
hagberd
in
the
little
seaport
of
colebrook
was
not
exactly
in
his
favour
he
did
not
belong
to
the
place
he
had
come
to
settle
there
under
circumstances
not
at
all
mysterious
he
used
to
be
very
communicative
about
them
at
the
time
but
extremely
morbid
and
unreasonable
he
was
possessed
of
some
little
money
evidently
because
he
bought
a
plot
of
ground
and
had
a
pair
of
ugly
yellow
brick
cottages
run
up
very
cheaply
he
occupied
one
of
them
himself
and
let
the
other
to
josiah
carvil
blind
carvil
the
retired
a
man
of
evil
repute
as
a
domestic
tyrant
these
cottages
had
one
wall
in
common
shared
in
a
line
of
iron
railing
dividing
their
front
gardens
a
wooden
fence
separated
their
back
gardens
miss
bessie
carvil
was
allowed
as
it
were
of
right
to
throw
over
it
the
blue
rags
or
an
apron
that
wanted
drying
it
rots
the
wood
bessie
my
girl
the
captain
would
remark
mildly
from
his
side
of
the
fence
each
time
he
saw
her
exercising
that
privilege
she
was
a
tall
girl
the
fence
was
low
and
she
could
spread
her
elbows
on
the
top
her
hands
would
be
red
with
the
bit
of
washing
she
had
done
but
her
forearms
were
white
and
shapely
and
she
would
look
at
her
father
s
landlord
in
silence
in
an
informed
silence
which
had
an
air
of
knowledge
expectation
and
desire
it
rots
the
wood
repeated
captain
hagberd
it
is
the
only
unthrifty
careless
habit
i
know
in
you
why
don
t
you
have
a
clothes
line
out
in
your
back
yard
miss
carvil
would
say
nothing
to
this
she
only
shook
her
head
negatively
the
tiny
back
yard
on
her
side
had
a
few
little
beds
of
black
earth
in
which
the
simple
flowers
she
found
time
to
cultivate
appeared
somehow
extravagantly
overgrown
as
if
belonging
to
an
exotic
clime
and
captain
hagberd
s
upright
hale
person
clad
in
no
from
head
to
foot
would
be
emerging
out
of
rank
grass
and
the
tall
weeks
on
his
side
of
the
fence
he
appeared
with
the
colour
and
uncouth
stiffness
of
the
extraordinary
material
in
which
he
chose
to
clothe
himself
for
the
time
being
would
be
his
mumbled
remark
to
any
observation
on
the
subject
like
a
man
roughened
out
of
granite
standing
in
a
wilderness
not
big
enough
for
a
decent
a
heavy
figure
of
a
man
of
stone
with
a
red
handsome
face
a
blue
wandering
eye
and
a
great
white
beard
flowing
to
his
waist
and
never
trimmed
as
far
as
colebrook
knew
seven
years
before
he
had
seriously
answered
next
month
i
think
to
the
chaffing
attempt
to
secure
his
custom
made
by
that
distinguished
local
wit
the
colebrook
barber
who
happened
to
be
sitting
insolently
in
the
of
the
new
inn
near
the
harbour
where
the
captain
had
entered
to
buy
an
ounce
of
tobacco
after
paying
for
his
purchase
with
three
extracted
from
the
corner
of
a
handkerchief
which
he
carried
in
the
cuff
of
his
sleeve
captain
hagberd
went
out
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
the
barber
laughed
the
old
one
and
the
young
one
will
be
strolling
arm
in
arm
to
get
shaved
in
my
place
presently
the
tailor
shall
be
set
to
work
and
the
barber
and
the
candlestick
maker
high
old
times
are
coming
for
colebrook
they
are
coming
to
be
sure
it
used
to
be
next
week
now
it
has
come
to
next
month
and
so
on
soon
it
will
be
next
spring
for
all
i
noticing
a
stranger
listening
to
him
with
a
vacant
grin
he
explained
stretching
out
his
legs
cynically
that
this
queer
old
hagberd
a
retired
was
waiting
for
the
return
of
a
son
of
his
the
boy
had
been
driven
away
from
home
he
shouldn
t
wonder
had
run
away
to
sea
and
had
never
been
heard
of
since
put
to
rest
in
davy
jones
s
locker
this
many
a
day
as
likely
as
not
that
old
man
came
flying
to
colebrook
three
years
ago
all
in
black
broadcloth
had
lost
his
wife
lately
then
getting
out
of
a
smoker
as
if
the
devil
had
been
at
his
heels
and
the
only
thing
that
brought
him
down
was
a
letter
a
hoax
probably
some
joker
had
written
to
him
about
a
seafaring
man
with
some
such
name
who
was
supposed
to
be
hanging
about
some
girl
or
other
either
in
colebrook
or
in
the
neighbourhood
funny
ain
t
it
the
old
chap
had
been
advertising
in
the
london
papers
for
harry
hagberd
and
offering
rewards
for
any
sort
of
likely
information
and
the
barber
would
go
on
to
describe
with
sardonic
gusto
how
that
stranger
in
mourning
had
been
seen
exploring
the
country
in
carts
on
foot
taking
everybody
into
his
confidence
visiting
all
the
inns
and
alehouses
for
miles
around
stopping
people
on
the
road
with
his
questions
looking
into
the
very
ditches
almost
first
in
the
greatest
excitement
then
with
a
plodding
sort
of
perseverance
growing
slower
and
slower
and
he
could
not
even
tell
you
plainly
how
his
son
looked
the
sailor
was
supposed
to
be
one
of
two
that
had
left
a
timber
ship
and
to
have
been
seen
dangling
after
some
girl
but
the
old
man
described
a
boy
of
fourteen
or
so
a
and
when
people
only
smiled
at
this
he
would
rub
his
forehead
in
a
confused
sort
of
way
before
he
slunk
off
looking
offended
he
found
nobody
of
course
not
a
trace
of
anybody
never
heard
of
anything
worth
belief
at
any
rate
but
he
had
not
been
able
somehow
to
tear
himself
away
from
colebrook
it
was
the
shock
of
this
disappointment
perhaps
coming
soon
after
the
loss
of
his
wife
that
had
driven
him
crazy
on
that
point
the
barber
suggested
with
an
air
of
great
psychological
insight
after
a
time
the
old
man
abandoned
the
active
search
his
son
had
evidently
gone
away
but
he
settled
himself
to
wait
his
son
had
been
once
at
least
in
colebrook
in
preference
to
his
native
place
there
must
have
been
some
reason
for
it
he
seemed
to
think
some
very
powerful
inducement
that
would
bring
him
back
to
colebrook
again
ha
ha
ha
why
of
course
colebrook
where
else
that
s
the
only
place
in
the
united
kingdom
for
your
sons
so
he
sold
up
his
old
home
in
colchester
and
down
he
comes
here
well
it
s
a
craze
like
any
other
wouldn
t
catch
me
going
crazy
over
any
of
my
youngsters
clearing
out
i
ve
got
eight
of
them
at
the
barber
was
showing
off
his
strength
of
mind
in
the
midst
of
a
laughter
that
shook
the
strange
though
that
sort
of
thing
he
would
confess
with
the
frankness
of
a
superior
intelligence
seemed
to
be
catching
his
establishment
for
instance
was
near
the
harbour
and
whenever
a
came
in
for
a
or
a
shave
if
it
was
a
strange
face
he
couldn
t
help
thinking
directly
suppose
he
s
the
son
of
old
hagberd
he
laughed
at
himself
for
it
it
was
a
strong
craze
he
could
remember
the
time
when
the
whole
town
was
full
of
it
but
he
had
his
hopes
of
the
old
chap
yet
he
would
cure
him
by
a
course
of
judicious
chaffing
he
was
watching
the
progress
of
the
treatment
next
week
next
month
next
year
when
the
old
skipper
had
put
off
the
date
of
that
return
till
next
year
he
would
be
well
on
his
way
to
not
saying
any
more
about
it
in
other
matters
he
was
quite
rational
so
this
too
was
bound
to
come
such
was
the
barber
s
firm
opinion
nobody
had
ever
contradicted
him
his
own
hair
had
gone
grey
since
that
time
and
captain
hagberd
s
beard
had
turned
quite
white
and
had
acquired
a
majestic
flow
over
the
no
canvas
suit
which
he
had
made
for
himself
secretly
with
tarred
twine
and
had
assumed
suddenly
coming
out
in
it
one
fine
morning
whereas
the
evening
before
he
had
been
seen
going
home
in
his
mourning
of
broadcloth
it
caused
a
sensation
in
the
high
street
shopkeepers
coming
to
their
doors
people
in
the
houses
snatching
up
their
hats
to
run
out
a
stir
at
which
he
seemed
strangely
surprised
at
first
and
then
scared
but
his
only
answer
to
the
wondering
questions
was
that
startled
and
evasive
for
the
that
sensation
had
been
forgotten
long
ago
and
captain
hagberd
himself
if
not
forgotten
had
come
to
be
disregarded
the
penalty
of
dailiness
as
the
sun
itself
is
disregarded
unless
it
makes
its
power
felt
heavily
captain
hagberd
s
movements
showed
no
infirmity
he
walked
stiffly
in
his
suit
of
canvas
a
quaint
and
remarkable
figure
only
his
eyes
wandered
more
furtively
perhaps
than
of
yore
his
manner
abroad
had
lost
its
excitable
watchfulness
it
had
become
puzzled
and
diffident
as
though
he
had
suspected
that
there
was
somewhere
about
him
something
slightly
compromising
some
embarrassing
oddity
and
yet
had
remained
unable
to
discover
what
on
earth
this
something
wrong
could
be
he
was
unwilling
now
to
talk
with
the
townsfolk
he
had
earned
for
himself
the
reputation
of
an
awful
skinflint
of
a
miser
in
the
matter
of
living
he
mumbled
regretfully
in
the
shops
bought
inferior
scraps
of
meat
after
long
hesitations
and
discouraged
all
allusions
to
his
costume
it
was
as
the
barber
had
foretold
for
all
one
could
tell
he
had
recovered
already
from
the
disease
of
hope
and
only
miss
bessie
carvil
knew
that
he
said
nothing
about
his
son
s
return
because
with
him
it
was
no
longer
next
week
next
month
or
even
next
it
was
in
their
intimacy
of
back
yard
and
front
garden
he
talked
with
her
paternally
reasonably
and
dogmatically
with
a
touch
of
arbitrariness
they
met
on
the
ground
of
unreserved
confidence
which
was
authenticated
by
an
affectionate
wink
now
and
then
miss
carvil
had
come
to
look
forward
rather
to
these
winks
at
first
they
had
discomposed
her
the
poor
fellow
was
mad
afterwards
she
had
learned
to
laugh
at
them
there
was
no
harm
in
him
now
she
was
aware
of
an
unacknowledged
pleasurable
incredulous
emotion
expressed
by
a
faint
blush
he
winked
not
in
the
least
vulgarly
his
thin
red
face
with
a
curved
nose
had
a
sort
of
distinction
the
more
so
that
when
he
talked
to
her
he
looked
with
a
steadier
and
more
intelligent
glance
a
handsome
hale
upright
capable
man
with
a
white
beard
you
did
not
think
of
his
age
his
son
he
affirmed
had
resembled
him
amazingly
from
his
earliest
babyhood
harry
would
be
next
july
he
declared
proper
age
to
get
married
with
a
nice
sensible
girl
that
could
appreciate
a
good
home
he
was
a
very
boy
husbands
were
the
easiest
to
manage
these
mean
soft
chaps
that
you
would
think
butter
wouldn
t
melt
in
their
mouths
were
the
ones
to
make
a
woman
thoroughly
miserable
and
there
was
nothing
like
a
home
a
fireside
a
good
roof
no
turning
out
of
your
warm
bed
in
all
sorts
of
weather
eh
my
dear
captain
hagberd
had
been
one
of
those
sailors
that
pursue
their
calling
within
sight
of
land
one
of
the
many
children
of
a
bankrupt
farmer
he
had
been
apprenticed
hurriedly
to
a
coasting
skipper
and
had
remained
on
the
coast
all
his
sea
life
it
must
have
been
a
hard
one
at
first
he
had
never
taken
to
it
his
affection
turned
to
the
land
with
its
innumerable
houses
with
its
quiet
lives
gathered
round
its
firesides
many
sailors
feel
and
profess
a
rational
dislike
for
the
sea
but
his
was
a
profound
and
emotional
animosity
as
if
the
love
of
the
stabler
element
had
been
bred
into
him
through
many
generations
people
did
not
know
what
they
let
their
boys
in
for
when
they
let
them
go
to
sea
he
expounded
to
bessie
as
soon
make
convicts
of
them
at
he
did
not
believe
you
ever
got
used
to
it
the
weariness
of
such
a
life
got
worse
as
you
got
older
what
sort
of
trade
was
it
in
which
more
than
half
your
time
you
did
not
put
your
foot
inside
your
house
directly
you
got
out
to
sea
you
had
no
means
of
knowing
what
went
on
at
home
one
might
have
thought
him
weary
of
distant
voyages
and
the
longest
he
had
ever
made
had
lasted
a
fortnight
of
which
the
most
part
had
been
spent
at
anchor
sheltering
from
the
weather
as
soon
as
his
wife
had
inherited
a
house
and
enough
to
live
on
from
a
bachelor
uncle
who
had
made
some
money
in
the
coal
business
he
threw
up
his
command
of
an
collier
with
a
feeling
as
though
he
had
escaped
from
the
galleys
after
all
these
years
he
might
have
counted
on
the
fingers
of
his
two
hands
all
the
days
he
had
been
out
of
sight
of
england
he
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
be
out
of
soundings
i
have
never
been
further
than
eighty
fathoms
from
the
land
was
one
of
his
boasts
bessie
carvil
heard
all
these
things
in
front
of
their
cottage
grew
an
ash
and
on
summer
afternoons
she
would
bring
out
a
chair
on
the
and
sit
down
with
her
sewing
captain
hagberd
in
his
canvas
suit
leaned
on
a
spade
he
dug
every
day
in
his
front
plot
he
turned
it
over
and
over
several
times
every
year
but
was
not
going
to
plant
anything
just
at
to
bessie
carvil
he
would
state
more
explicitly
not
till
our
harry
comes
home
and
she
had
heard
this
formula
of
hope
so
often
that
it
only
awakened
the
vaguest
pity
in
her
heart
for
that
hopeful
old
man
everything
was
put
off
in
that
way
and
everything
was
being
prepared
likewise
for
there
was
a
boxful
of
packets
of
various
to
choose
from
for
the
front
garden
he
will
doubtless
let
you
have
your
say
about
that
my
dear
captain
hagberd
intimated
to
her
across
the
railing
miss
bessie
s
head
remained
bowed
over
her
work
she
had
heard
all
this
so
many
times
but
now
and
then
she
would
rise
lay
down
her
sewing
and
come
slowly
to
the
fence
there
was
a
charm
in
these
gentle
ravings
he
was
determined
that
his
son
should
not
go
away
again
for
the
want
of
a
home
all
ready
for
him
he
had
been
filling
the
other
cottage
with
all
sorts
of
furniture
she
imagined
it
all
new
fresh
with
varnish
piled
up
as
in
a
warehouse
there
would
be
tables
wrapped
up
in
sacking
rolls
of
carpets
thick
and
vertical
like
fragments
of
columns
the
gleam
of
white
marble
tops
in
the
dimness
of
the
drawn
blinds
captain
hagberd
always
described
his
purchases
to
her
carefully
as
to
a
person
having
a
legitimate
interest
in
them
the
overgrown
yard
of
his
cottage
could
be
laid
over
with
concrete
after
we
may
just
as
well
do
away
with
the
fence
you
could
have
your
out
quite
clear
of
your
he
winked
and
she
would
blush
faintly
this
madness
that
had
entered
her
life
through
the
kind
impulses
of
her
heart
had
reasonable
details
what
if
some
day
his
son
returned
but
she
could
not
even
be
quite
sure
that
he
ever
had
a
son
and
if
he
existed
anywhere
he
had
been
too
long
away
when
captain
hagberd
got
excited
in
his
talk
she
would
steady
him
by
a
pretence
of
belief
laughing
a
little
to
salve
her
conscience
only
once
she
had
tried
pityingly
to
throw
some
doubt
on
that
hope
doomed
to
disappointment
but
the
effect
of
her
attempt
had
scared
her
very
much
all
at
once
over
that
man
s
face
there
came
an
expression
of
horror
and
incredulity
as
though
he
had
seen
a
crack
open
out
in
the
firmament
you
you
you
don
t
think
he
s
drowned
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
her
ready
to
go
out
of
his
mind
for
in
his
ordinary
state
she
thought
him
more
sane
than
people
gave
him
credit
for
on
that
occasion
the
violence
of
the
emotion
was
followed
by
a
most
paternal
and
complacent
recovery
don
t
alarm
yourself
my
dear
he
said
a
little
cunningly
the
sea
can
t
keep
him
he
does
not
belong
to
it
none
of
us
hagberds
ever
did
belong
to
it
look
at
me
i
didn
t
get
drowned
moreover
he
isn
t
a
sailor
at
all
and
if
he
is
not
a
sailor
he
s
bound
to
come
back
there
s
nothing
to
prevent
him
coming
back
his
eyes
began
to
wander
she
never
tried
again
for
fear
the
man
should
go
out
of
his
mind
on
the
spot
he
depended
on
her
she
seemed
the
only
sensible
person
in
the
town
and
he
would
congratulate
himself
frankly
before
her
face
on
having
secured
such
a
levelheaded
wife
for
his
son
the
rest
of
the
town
he
confided
to
her
once
in
a
fit
of
temper
was
certainly
queer
the
way
they
looked
at
you
the
way
they
talked
to
you
he
had
never
got
on
with
any
one
in
the
place
didn
t
like
the
people
he
would
not
have
left
his
own
country
if
it
had
not
been
clear
that
his
son
had
taken
a
fancy
to
colebrook
she
humoured
him
in
silence
listening
patiently
by
the
fence
crocheting
with
downcast
eyes
blushes
came
with
difficulty
on
her
complexion
under
the
negligently
twisted
opulence
of
hair
her
father
was
frankly
carroty
she
had
a
full
figure
a
tired
unrefreshed
face
when
captain
hagberd
vaunted
the
necessity
and
propriety
of
a
home
and
the
delights
of
one
s
own
fireside
she
smiled
a
little
with
her
lips
only
her
home
delights
had
been
confined
to
the
nursing
of
her
father
during
the
ten
best
years
of
her
life
a
bestial
roaring
coming
out
of
an
upstairs
window
would
interrupt
their
talk
she
would
begin
at
once
to
roll
up
her
or
fold
her
sewing
without
the
slightest
sign
of
haste
meanwhile
the
howls
and
roars
of
her
name
would
go
on
making
the
fishermen
strolling
upon
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
turn
their
heads
towards
the
cottages
she
would
go
in
slowly
at
the
front
door
and
a
moment
afterwards
there
would
fall
a
profound
silence
presently
she
would
reappear
leading
by
the
hand
a
man
gross
and
unwieldy
like
a
hippopotamus
with
a
surly
face
he
was
a
widowed
whom
blindness
had
overtaken
years
before
in
the
full
flush
of
business
he
behaved
to
his
daughter
as
if
she
had
been
responsible
for
its
incurable
character
he
had
been
heard
to
bellow
at
the
top
of
his
voice
as
if
to
defy
heaven
that
he
did
not
care
he
had
made
enough
money
to
have
ham
and
eggs
for
his
breakfast
every
morning
he
thanked
god
for
it
in
a
fiendish
tone
as
though
he
were
cursing
captain
hagberd
had
been
so
unfavourably
impressed
by
his
tenant
that
once
he
told
miss
bessie
he
is
a
very
extravagant
fellow
my
she
was
knitting
that
day
finishing
a
pair
of
socks
for
her
father
who
expected
her
to
keep
up
the
supply
dutifully
she
hated
knitting
and
as
she
was
just
at
the
heel
part
she
had
to
keep
her
eyes
on
her
needles
of
course
it
isn
t
as
if
he
had
a
son
to
provide
for
captain
hagberd
went
on
a
little
vacantly
girls
of
course
don
t
require
so
much
h
m
they
don
t
run
away
from
home
my
no
said
miss
bessie
quietly
captain
hagberd
amongst
the
mounds
of
earth
chuckled
with
his
maritime
rig
his
face
his
beard
of
father
neptune
he
resembled
a
deposed
who
had
exchanged
the
trident
for
the
spade
and
he
must
look
upon
you
as
already
provided
for
in
a
manner
that
s
the
best
of
it
with
the
girls
the
husbands
he
winked
miss
bessie
absorbed
in
her
knitting
coloured
faintly
bessie
my
hat
old
carvil
bellowed
out
suddenly
he
had
been
sitting
under
the
tree
mute
and
motionless
like
an
idol
of
some
remarkably
monstrous
superstition
he
never
opened
his
mouth
but
to
howl
for
her
at
her
sometimes
about
her
and
then
he
did
not
moderate
the
terms
of
his
abuse
her
system
was
never
to
answer
him
at
all
and
he
kept
up
his
shouting
till
he
got
attended
to
till
she
shook
him
by
the
arm
or
thrust
the
mouthpiece
of
his
pipe
between
his
teeth
he
was
one
of
the
few
blind
people
who
smoke
when
he
felt
the
hat
being
put
on
his
head
he
stopped
his
noise
at
once
then
he
rose
and
they
passed
together
through
the
gate
he
weighed
heavily
on
her
arm
during
their
slow
toilful
walks
she
appeared
to
be
dragging
with
her
for
a
penance
the
burden
of
that
infirm
bulk
usually
they
crossed
the
road
at
once
the
cottages
stood
in
the
fields
near
the
harbour
two
hundred
yards
away
from
the
end
of
the
street
and
for
a
long
long
time
they
would
remain
in
view
ascending
imperceptibly
the
flight
of
wooden
steps
that
led
to
the
top
of
the
it
ran
on
from
east
to
west
shutting
out
the
channel
like
a
neglected
railway
embankment
on
which
no
train
had
ever
rolled
within
memory
of
man
groups
of
sturdy
fishermen
would
emerge
upon
the
sky
walk
along
for
a
bit
and
sink
without
haste
their
brown
nets
like
the
cobwebs
of
gigantic
spiders
lay
on
the
shabby
grass
of
the
slope
and
looking
up
from
the
end
of
the
street
the
people
of
the
town
would
recognise
the
two
carvils
by
the
creeping
slowness
of
their
gait
captain
hagberd
pottering
aimlessly
about
his
cottages
would
raise
his
head
to
see
how
they
got
on
in
their
promenade
he
advertised
still
in
the
sunday
papers
for
harry
hagberd
these
sheets
were
read
in
foreign
parts
to
the
end
of
the
world
he
informed
bessie
at
the
same
time
he
seemed
to
think
that
his
son
was
in
england
so
near
to
colebrook
that
he
would
of
course
turn
up
bessie
without
committing
herself
to
that
opinion
in
so
many
words
argued
that
in
that
case
the
expense
of
advertising
was
unnecessary
captain
hagberd
had
better
spend
that
weekly
on
himself
she
declared
she
did
not
know
what
he
lived
on
her
argumentation
would
puzzle
him
and
cast
him
down
for
a
time
they
all
do
it
he
pointed
out
there
was
a
whole
column
devoted
to
appeals
after
missing
relatives
he
would
bring
the
newspaper
to
show
her
he
and
his
wife
had
advertised
for
years
only
she
was
an
impatient
woman
the
news
from
colebrook
had
arrived
the
very
day
after
her
funeral
if
she
had
not
been
so
impatient
she
might
have
been
here
now
with
no
more
than
one
day
more
to
wait
you
are
not
an
impatient
woman
my
i
ve
no
patience
with
you
sometimes
she
would
say
if
he
still
advertised
for
his
son
he
did
not
offer
rewards
for
information
any
more
for
with
the
muddled
lucidity
of
a
mental
derangement
he
had
reasoned
himself
into
a
conviction
as
clear
as
daylight
that
he
had
already
attained
all
that
could
be
expected
in
that
way
what
more
could
he
want
colebrook
was
the
place
and
there
was
no
need
to
ask
for
more
miss
carvil
praised
him
for
his
good
sense
and
he
was
soothed
by
the
part
she
took
in
his
hope
which
had
become
his
delusion
in
that
idea
which
blinded
his
mind
to
truth
and
probability
just
as
the
other
old
man
in
the
other
cottage
had
been
made
blind
by
another
disease
to
the
light
and
beauty
of
the
world
but
anything
he
could
interpret
as
a
doubt
any
coldness
of
assent
or
even
a
simple
inattention
to
the
development
of
his
projects
of
a
home
with
his
returned
son
and
his
son
s
wife
would
irritate
him
into
flings
and
jerks
and
wicked
side
glances
he
would
dash
his
spade
into
the
ground
and
walk
to
and
fro
before
it
miss
bessie
called
it
his
tantrums
she
shook
her
finger
at
him
then
when
she
came
out
again
after
he
had
parted
with
her
in
anger
he
would
watch
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
for
the
least
sign
of
encouragement
to
approach
the
iron
railings
and
resume
his
fatherly
and
patronising
relations
for
all
their
intimacy
which
had
lasted
some
years
now
they
had
never
talked
without
a
fence
or
a
railing
between
them
he
described
to
her
all
the
splendours
accumulated
for
the
of
their
housekeeping
but
had
never
invited
her
to
an
inspection
no
human
eye
was
to
behold
them
till
harry
had
his
first
look
in
fact
nobody
had
ever
been
inside
his
cottage
he
did
his
own
housework
and
he
guarded
his
son
s
privilege
so
jealously
that
the
small
objects
of
domestic
use
he
bought
sometimes
in
the
town
were
smuggled
rapidly
across
the
front
garden
under
his
canvas
coat
then
coming
out
he
would
remark
apologetically
it
was
only
a
small
kettle
my
and
if
not
too
tired
with
her
drudgery
or
worried
beyond
endurance
by
her
father
she
would
laugh
at
him
with
a
blush
and
say
that
s
all
right
captain
hagberd
i
am
not
well
my
dear
you
haven
t
long
to
wait
now
he
would
answer
with
a
sudden
bashfulness
and
looking
uneasily
as
though
he
had
suspected
that
there
was
something
wrong
somewhere
every
monday
she
paid
him
his
rent
over
the
railings
he
clutched
the
shillings
greedily
he
grudged
every
penny
he
had
to
spend
on
his
maintenance
and
when
he
left
her
to
make
his
purchases
his
bearing
changed
as
soon
as
he
got
into
the
street
away
from
the
sanction
of
her
pity
he
felt
himself
exposed
without
defence
he
brushed
the
walls
with
his
shoulder
he
mistrusted
the
queerness
of
the
people
yet
by
then
even
the
town
children
had
left
off
calling
after
him
and
the
tradesmen
served
him
without
a
word
the
slightest
allusion
to
his
clothing
had
the
power
to
puzzle
and
frighten
especially
as
if
it
were
something
utterly
unwarranted
and
incomprehensible
in
the
autumn
the
driving
rain
drummed
on
his
sailcloth
suit
saturated
almost
to
the
stiffness
of
with
its
surface
flowing
with
water
when
the
weather
was
too
bad
he
retreated
under
the
tiny
porch
and
standing
close
against
the
door
looked
at
his
spade
left
planted
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
the
ground
was
so
much
dug
up
all
over
that
as
the
season
advanced
it
turned
to
a
quagmire
when
it
froze
hard
he
was
disconsolate
what
would
harry
say
and
as
he
could
not
have
so
much
of
bessie
s
company
at
that
time
of
the
year
the
roars
of
old
carvil
that
came
muffled
through
the
closed
windows
calling
her
indoors
exasperated
him
greatly
why
don
t
that
extravagant
fellow
get
you
a
servant
he
asked
impatiently
one
mild
afternoon
she
had
thrown
something
over
her
head
to
run
out
for
a
while
i
don
t
know
said
the
pale
bessie
wearily
staring
away
with
her
grey
and
unexpectant
glance
there
were
always
smudgy
shadows
under
her
eyes
and
she
did
not
seem
able
to
see
any
change
or
any
end
to
her
life
you
wait
till
you
get
married
my
dear
said
her
only
friend
drawing
closer
to
the
fence
harry
will
get
you
his
hopeful
craze
seemed
to
mock
her
own
want
of
hope
with
so
bitter
an
aptness
that
in
her
nervous
irritation
she
could
have
screamed
at
him
outright
but
she
only
said
in
and
speaking
to
him
as
though
he
had
been
sane
why
captain
hagberd
your
son
may
not
even
want
to
look
at
he
flung
his
head
back
and
laughed
his
throaty
affected
cackle
of
anger
what
that
boy
not
want
to
look
at
the
only
sensible
girl
for
miles
around
what
do
you
think
i
am
here
for
my
dear
my
dear
my
dear
what
you
wait
you
just
wait
you
ll
see
i
ll
soon
bessie
bessie
bessie
howled
old
carvil
inside
bessie
my
pipe
that
fat
blind
man
had
given
himself
up
to
a
very
lust
of
laziness
he
would
not
lift
his
hand
to
reach
for
the
things
she
took
care
to
leave
at
his
very
elbow
he
would
not
move
a
limb
he
would
not
rise
from
his
chair
he
would
not
put
one
foot
before
another
in
that
parlour
where
he
knew
his
way
as
well
as
if
he
had
his
sight
without
calling
her
to
his
side
and
hanging
all
his
atrocious
weight
on
her
shoulder
he
would
not
eat
one
single
mouthful
of
food
without
her
close
attendance
he
had
made
himself
helpless
beyond
his
affliction
to
enslave
her
better
she
stood
still
for
a
moment
setting
her
teeth
in
the
dusk
then
turned
and
walked
slowly
indoors
captain
hagberd
went
back
to
his
spade
the
shouting
in
carvil
s
cottage
stopped
and
after
a
while
the
window
of
the
parlour
downstairs
was
lit
up
a
man
coming
from
the
end
of
the
street
with
a
firm
leisurely
step
passed
on
but
seemed
to
have
caught
sight
of
captain
hagberd
because
he
turned
back
a
pace
or
two
a
cold
white
light
lingered
in
the
western
sky
the
man
leaned
over
the
gate
in
an
interested
manner
you
must
be
captain
hagberd
he
said
with
easy
assurance
the
old
man
spun
round
pulling
out
his
spade
startled
by
the
strange
voice
yes
i
am
he
answered
nervously
the
other
smiling
straight
at
him
uttered
very
slowly
you
ve
been
advertising
for
your
son
i
believe
my
son
harry
mumbled
captain
hagberd
off
his
guard
for
once
he
s
coming
home
the
devil
he
is
the
stranger
marvelled
greatly
and
then
went
on
with
only
a
slight
change
of
tone
you
ve
grown
a
beard
like
father
christmas
captain
hagberd
drew
a
little
nearer
and
leaned
forward
over
his
spade
go
your
way
he
said
resentfully
and
timidly
at
the
same
time
because
he
was
always
afraid
of
being
laughed
at
every
mental
state
even
madness
has
its
equilibrium
based
upon
its
disturbance
causes
unhappiness
and
captain
hagberd
lived
amongst
a
scheme
of
settled
notions
which
it
pained
him
to
feel
disturbed
by
people
s
grins
yes
people
s
grins
were
awful
they
hinted
at
something
wrong
but
what
he
could
not
tell
and
that
stranger
was
obviously
grinning
had
come
on
purpose
to
grin
it
was
bad
enough
on
the
streets
but
he
had
never
before
been
outraged
like
this
the
stranger
unaware
how
near
he
was
of
having
his
head
laid
open
with
a
spade
said
seriously
i
am
not
trespassing
where
i
stand
am
i
i
fancy
there
s
something
wrong
about
your
news
suppose
you
let
me
come
come
in
murmured
old
hagberd
with
inexpressible
horror
i
could
give
you
some
real
information
about
your
son
the
very
latest
tip
if
you
care
to
no
shouted
hagberd
he
began
to
pace
wildly
to
and
fro
he
shouldered
his
spade
he
gesticulated
with
his
other
arm
here
s
a
fellow
a
grinning
fellow
who
says
there
s
something
wrong
i
ve
got
more
information
than
you
re
aware
of
i
ve
all
the
information
i
want
i
ve
had
it
for
years
for
years
for
years
enough
to
last
me
till
let
you
come
in
indeed
what
would
harry
say
bessie
carvil
s
figure
appeared
in
black
silhouette
on
the
parlour
window
then
with
the
sound
of
an
opening
door
flitted
out
before
the
other
cottage
all
black
but
with
something
white
over
her
head
these
two
voices
beginning
to
talk
suddenly
outside
she
had
heard
them
indoors
had
given
her
such
an
emotion
that
she
could
not
utter
a
sound
captain
hagberd
seemed
to
be
trying
to
find
his
way
out
of
a
cage
his
feet
squelched
in
the
puddles
left
by
his
industry
he
stumbled
in
the
holes
of
the
ruined
he
ran
blindly
against
the
fence
here
steady
a
bit
said
the
man
at
the
gate
gravely
stretching
his
arm
over
and
catching
him
by
the
sleeve
somebody
s
been
trying
to
get
at
you
hallo
what
s
this
rig
you
ve
got
on
storm
canvas
by
george
he
had
a
big
laugh
well
you
a
character
captain
hagberd
jerked
himself
free
and
began
to
back
away
shrinkingly
for
the
present
he
muttered
in
a
crestfallen
tone
what
s
the
matter
with
him
the
stranger
addressed
bessie
with
the
utmost
familiarity
in
a
deliberate
explanatory
tone
i
didn
t
want
to
startle
the
old
he
lowered
his
voice
as
though
he
had
known
her
for
years
i
dropped
into
a
barber
s
on
my
way
to
get
a
twopenny
shave
and
they
told
me
there
he
was
something
of
a
character
the
old
man
has
been
a
character
all
his
captain
hagberd
daunted
by
the
allusion
to
his
clothing
had
retreated
inside
taking
his
spade
with
him
and
the
two
at
the
gate
startled
by
the
unexpected
slamming
of
the
door
heard
the
bolts
being
shot
the
snapping
of
the
lock
and
the
echo
of
an
affected
gurgling
laugh
within
i
didn
t
want
to
upset
him
the
man
said
after
a
short
silence
what
s
the
meaning
of
all
this
he
isn
t
quite
he
has
been
worrying
a
long
time
about
his
lost
son
said
bessie
in
a
low
apologetic
tone
well
i
am
his
harry
she
cried
and
was
profoundly
silent
know
my
name
friends
with
the
old
man
eh
he
s
our
landlord
bessie
faltered
out
catching
hold
of
the
iron
railing
owns
both
them
does
he
commented
young
hagberd
scornfully
just
the
thing
he
would
be
proud
of
can
you
tell
me
who
s
that
chap
coming
you
must
know
something
of
it
i
tell
you
it
s
a
swindle
on
the
old
man
nothing
she
did
not
answer
helpless
before
an
insurmountable
difficulty
appalled
before
the
necessity
the
impossibility
and
the
dread
of
an
explanation
in
which
she
and
madness
seemed
involved
together
oh
i
am
so
sorry
she
murmured
what
s
the
matter
he
said
with
serenity
you
needn
t
be
afraid
of
upsetting
me
it
s
the
other
fellow
that
ll
be
upset
when
he
least
expects
it
i
don
t
care
a
hang
but
there
will
be
some
fun
when
he
shows
his
mug
i
don
t
care
for
the
old
man
s
pieces
but
right
is
right
you
shall
see
me
put
a
head
on
that
coon
whoever
he
is
he
had
come
nearer
and
towered
above
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
railings
he
glanced
at
her
hands
he
fancied
she
was
trembling
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
had
her
part
perhaps
in
that
little
game
that
was
to
be
sprung
on
his
old
man
he
had
come
just
in
time
to
spoil
their
sport
he
was
entertained
by
the
idea
scornful
of
the
baffled
plot
but
all
his
life
he
had
been
full
of
indulgence
for
all
sorts
of
women
s
tricks
she
really
was
trembling
very
much
her
wrap
had
slipped
off
her
head
poor
devil
he
thought
never
mind
about
that
chap
i
daresay
he
ll
change
his
mind
before
but
what
about
me
i
can
t
loaf
about
the
gate
til
the
she
burst
out
it
is
you
yourself
that
he
s
waiting
for
it
is
who
come
he
murmured
oh
it
s
me
blankly
and
they
seemed
to
become
breathless
together
apparently
he
was
pondering
over
what
he
had
heard
then
without
irritation
but
evidently
perplexed
he
said
i
don
t
understand
i
hadn
t
written
or
anything
it
s
my
chum
who
saw
the
paper
and
told
me
this
very
morning
eh
what
he
bent
his
ear
she
whispered
rapidly
and
he
listened
for
a
while
muttering
the
words
yes
and
i
see
at
times
then
but
why
won
t
today
do
he
queried
at
last
you
didn
t
understand
me
she
exclaimed
impatiently
the
clear
streak
of
light
under
the
clouds
died
out
in
the
west
again
he
stooped
slightly
to
hear
better
and
the
deep
night
buried
everything
of
the
whispering
woman
and
the
attentive
man
except
the
familiar
contiguity
of
their
faces
with
its
air
of
secrecy
and
caress
he
squared
his
shoulders
the
shadow
of
a
hat
sat
cavalierly
on
his
head
awkward
this
eh
he
appealed
to
her
well
well
never
heard
tell
of
anything
like
this
it
s
all
then
without
any
sort
of
as
far
as
i
can
she
remained
still
and
mute
and
you
have
been
encouraging
this
funny
notion
he
said
i
never
contradicted
why
didn
t
you
what
for
should
i
she
defended
herself
it
would
only
have
made
him
miserable
he
would
have
gone
out
of
his
his
mind
he
muttered
and
heard
a
short
nervous
laugh
from
her
where
was
the
harm
was
i
to
quarrel
with
the
poor
old
man
it
was
easier
to
half
believe
it
aye
aye
he
meditated
intelligently
i
suppose
the
old
chap
got
around
you
somehow
with
his
soft
talk
you
are
her
hands
moved
up
in
the
dark
nervously
and
it
might
have
been
true
it
was
true
it
has
come
here
it
is
this
is
the
we
have
been
waiting
she
drew
a
breath
and
he
said
aye
with
the
door
shut
i
wouldn
t
care
if
and
you
think
he
could
be
brought
round
to
recognise
me
eh
what
you
could
do
it
in
a
week
you
say
h
m
i
daresay
you
could
but
do
you
think
i
could
hold
out
a
week
in
this
place
not
me
i
want
either
hard
work
or
an
racket
or
more
space
than
there
is
in
the
whole
of
england
i
have
been
in
this
place
though
once
before
and
for
more
than
a
week
the
old
man
was
advertising
for
me
then
and
a
chum
i
had
with
me
had
a
notion
of
getting
a
couple
quid
out
of
him
by
writing
a
lot
of
silly
nonsense
in
a
letter
that
lark
did
not
come
off
though
we
had
to
clear
out
and
none
too
soon
but
this
time
i
ve
a
chum
waiting
for
me
in
london
and
besides
bessie
carvil
was
breathing
quickly
what
if
i
tried
a
knock
at
the
door
he
suggested
try
she
said
captain
hagberd
s
gate
squeaked
and
the
shadow
of
the
son
moved
on
then
stopped
with
another
deep
laugh
in
the
throat
like
the
father
s
only
soft
and
gentle
thrilling
to
the
woman
s
heart
awakening
to
her
ears
he
isn
t
frisky
is
he
i
would
be
afraid
to
lay
hold
of
him
the
chaps
are
always
telling
me
i
don
t
know
my
own
he
s
the
most
harmless
creature
that
ever
lived
she
interrupted
you
wouldn
t
say
so
if
you
had
seen
him
chasing
me
upstairs
with
a
hard
leather
strap
he
said
i
haven
t
forgotten
it
in
sixteen
she
got
warm
from
head
to
foot
under
another
soft
subdued
laugh
at
the
of
the
knocker
her
heart
flew
into
her
mouth
hey
dad
let
me
in
i
am
harry
i
am
straight
come
back
home
a
day
too
one
of
the
windows
upstairs
ran
up
a
grinning
information
fellow
said
the
voice
of
old
hagberd
up
in
the
darkness
don
t
you
have
anything
to
do
with
him
it
will
spoil
she
heard
harry
hagberd
say
hallo
dad
then
a
clanging
clatter
the
window
rumbled
down
and
he
stood
before
her
again
it
s
just
like
old
times
nearly
walloped
the
life
out
of
me
to
stop
me
going
away
and
now
i
come
back
he
throws
a
confounded
shovel
at
my
head
to
keep
me
out
it
grazed
my
she
shuddered
i
wouldn
t
care
he
began
only
i
spent
my
last
shillings
on
the
railway
fare
and
my
last
twopence
on
a
shave
out
of
respect
for
the
old
are
you
really
harry
hagberd
she
asked
can
you
prove
it
can
i
prove
it
can
any
one
else
prove
it
he
said
jovially
prove
with
what
what
do
i
want
to
prove
there
isn
t
a
single
corner
in
the
world
barring
england
perhaps
where
you
could
not
find
some
man
or
more
likely
woman
that
would
remember
me
for
harry
hagberd
i
am
more
like
harry
hagberd
than
any
man
alive
and
i
can
prove
it
to
you
in
a
minute
if
you
will
let
me
step
inside
your
come
in
she
said
he
entered
then
the
front
garden
of
the
carvils
his
tall
shadow
strode
with
a
swagger
she
turned
her
back
on
the
window
and
waited
watching
the
shape
of
which
the
footfalls
seemed
the
most
material
part
the
light
fell
on
a
tilted
hat
a
powerful
shoulder
that
seemed
to
cleave
the
darkness
on
a
leg
stepping
out
he
swung
about
and
stood
still
facing
the
illuminated
parlour
window
at
her
back
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
laughing
softly
to
himself
just
fancy
for
a
minute
the
old
man
s
beard
stuck
on
to
my
chin
hey
now
say
i
was
the
very
spit
of
him
from
a
it
s
true
she
murmured
to
herself
and
that
s
about
as
far
as
it
goes
he
was
always
one
of
your
domestic
characters
why
i
remember
how
he
used
to
go
about
looking
very
sick
for
three
days
before
he
had
to
leave
home
on
one
of
his
trips
to
south
shields
for
coal
he
had
a
standing
charter
from
the
you
would
think
he
was
off
on
a
whaling
cruise
three
years
and
a
tail
ha
ha
not
a
bit
of
it
ten
days
on
the
outside
the
skimmer
of
the
seas
was
a
smart
craft
fine
name
wasn
t
it
mother
s
uncle
owned
her
he
interrupted
himself
and
in
a
lowered
voice
did
he
ever
tell
you
what
mother
died
of
he
asked
yes
said
miss
bessie
bitterly
from
he
made
no
sound
for
a
while
then
brusquely
they
were
so
afraid
i
would
turn
out
badly
that
they
fairly
drove
me
away
mother
nagged
at
me
for
being
idle
and
the
old
man
said
he
would
cut
my
soul
out
of
my
body
rather
than
let
me
go
to
sea
well
it
looked
as
if
he
would
do
it
too
so
i
went
it
looks
to
me
sometimes
as
if
i
had
been
born
to
them
by
a
mistake
in
that
other
hutch
of
a
where
ought
you
to
have
been
born
by
rights
bessie
carvil
interrupted
him
defiantly
in
the
open
upon
a
beach
on
a
windy
night
he
said
quick
as
lightning
then
he
mused
slowly
they
were
characters
both
of
them
by
george
and
the
old
man
keeps
it
up
well
don
t
he
a
damned
shovel
on
the
hark
who
s
that
making
that
row
bessie
it
s
in
your
it
s
for
me
she
said
with
indifference
he
stepped
aside
out
of
the
streak
of
light
your
husband
he
inquired
with
the
tone
of
a
man
accustomed
to
unlawful
trysts
fine
voice
for
a
ship
s
deck
in
a
thundering
no
my
father
i
am
not
you
seem
a
fine
girl
miss
bessie
dear
he
said
at
once
she
turned
her
face
away
oh
i
say
what
s
up
who
s
murdering
him
he
wants
his
she
faced
him
still
and
tall
with
averted
head
with
her
hands
hanging
clasped
before
her
hadn
t
you
better
go
in
he
suggested
after
watching
for
a
while
the
nape
of
her
neck
a
patch
of
dazzling
white
skin
and
soft
shadow
above
the
sombre
line
of
her
shoulders
her
wrap
had
slipped
down
to
her
elbows
you
ll
have
all
the
town
coming
out
presently
i
ll
wait
here
a
her
wrap
fell
to
the
ground
and
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
she
had
vanished
he
threw
it
over
his
arm
and
approaching
the
window
squarely
he
saw
a
monstrous
form
of
a
fat
man
in
an
armchair
an
unshaded
lamp
the
yawning
of
an
enormous
mouth
in
a
big
flat
face
encircled
by
a
ragged
halo
of
hair
miss
bessie
s
head
and
bust
the
shouting
stopped
the
blind
ran
down
he
lost
himself
in
thinking
how
awkward
it
was
father
mad
no
getting
into
the
house
no
money
to
get
back
a
hungry
chum
in
london
who
would
begin
to
think
he
had
been
given
the
damn
he
muttered
he
could
break
the
door
in
certainly
but
they
would
perhaps
bundle
him
into
chokey
for
that
without
asking
questions
no
great
matter
only
he
was
confoundedly
afraid
of
being
locked
up
even
in
mistake
he
turned
cold
at
the
thought
he
stamped
his
feet
on
the
sodden
grass
what
are
you
a
sailor
said
an
agitated
voice
she
had
flitted
out
a
shadow
herself
attracted
by
the
reckless
shadow
waiting
under
the
wall
of
her
home
anything
enough
of
a
sailor
to
be
worth
my
salt
before
the
mast
came
home
that
way
this
where
do
you
come
from
she
asked
right
away
from
a
jolly
good
spree
he
said
by
the
london
train
see
ough
i
hate
being
shut
up
in
a
train
i
don
t
mind
a
house
so
ah
she
said
that
s
because
in
a
house
you
can
at
any
time
open
the
blamed
door
and
walk
away
straight
before
and
never
come
back
not
for
sixteen
years
at
least
he
laughed
to
a
rabbit
hutch
and
get
a
confounded
old
shovel
a
ship
is
not
so
very
big
she
taunted
no
but
the
sea
is
she
dropped
her
head
and
as
if
her
ears
had
been
opened
to
the
voices
of
the
world
she
heard
beyond
the
rampart
of
the
swell
of
yesterday
s
gale
breaking
on
the
beach
with
monotonous
and
solemn
vibrations
as
if
all
the
earth
had
been
a
tolling
bell
and
then
why
a
ship
s
a
ship
you
love
her
and
leave
her
and
a
voyage
isn
t
a
he
quoted
the
sailor
s
saying
lightly
it
is
not
a
marriage
she
whispered
i
never
took
a
false
name
and
i
ve
never
yet
told
a
lie
to
a
woman
what
lie
why
lie
take
me
or
leave
me
i
say
and
if
you
take
me
then
it
is
he
hummed
a
snatch
very
low
leaning
against
the
wall
oh
ho
ho
rio
and
fare
thee
well
my
bonnie
young
girl
we
re
bound
to
rio
capstan
song
he
explained
her
teeth
chattered
you
are
cold
he
said
here
s
that
affair
of
yours
i
picked
she
felt
his
hands
about
her
wrapping
her
closely
hold
the
ends
together
in
front
he
commanded
what
did
you
come
here
for
she
asked
repressing
a
shudder
five
quid
he
answered
promptly
we
let
our
spree
go
on
a
little
too
long
and
got
hard
you
ve
been
drinking
she
said
blind
three
days
on
purpose
i
am
not
given
that
way
don
t
you
think
there
s
nothing
and
nobody
that
can
get
over
me
unless
i
like
i
can
be
as
steady
as
a
rock
my
chum
sees
the
paper
this
morning
and
says
he
to
me
go
on
harry
loving
parent
that
s
five
quid
so
we
scraped
all
our
pockets
for
the
fare
devil
of
a
lark
you
have
a
hard
heart
i
am
afraid
she
sighed
what
for
for
running
away
why
he
wanted
to
make
a
lawyer
s
clerk
of
me
just
to
please
himself
master
in
his
own
house
and
my
poor
mother
egged
him
on
for
my
good
i
suppose
well
then
so
long
and
i
went
no
i
tell
you
the
day
i
cleared
out
i
was
all
black
and
blue
from
his
great
fondness
for
me
ah
he
was
always
a
bit
of
a
character
look
at
that
shovel
now
off
his
chump
not
much
that
s
just
exactly
like
my
dad
he
wants
me
here
just
to
have
somebody
to
order
about
however
we
two
were
hard
up
and
what
s
five
quid
to
him
once
in
sixteen
hard
years
oh
but
i
am
sorry
for
you
did
you
never
want
to
come
back
home
be
a
lawyer
s
clerk
and
rot
here
in
some
such
place
as
this
he
cried
in
contempt
what
if
the
old
man
set
me
up
in
a
home
i
would
kick
it
down
about
my
ears
or
else
die
there
before
the
third
day
was
and
where
else
is
it
that
you
hope
to
die
in
the
bush
somewhere
in
the
sea
on
a
blamed
for
choice
at
home
yes
the
world
s
my
home
but
i
expect
i
ll
die
in
a
hospital
some
day
what
of
that
any
place
is
good
enough
as
long
as
i
ve
lived
and
i
ve
been
everything
you
can
think
of
almost
but
a
tailor
or
a
soldier
i
ve
been
a
boundary
rider
i
ve
sheared
sheep
and
humped
my
swag
and
harpooned
a
whale
i
ve
rigged
ships
and
prospected
for
gold
and
skinned
dead
bullocks
and
turned
my
back
on
more
money
than
the
old
man
would
have
scraped
in
his
whole
life
ha
ha
he
overwhelmed
her
she
pulled
herself
together
and
managed
to
utter
time
to
rest
he
straightened
himself
up
away
from
the
wall
and
in
a
severe
voice
said
time
to
but
he
did
not
move
he
leaned
back
again
and
hummed
thoughtfully
a
bar
or
two
of
an
outlandish
tune
she
felt
as
if
she
were
about
to
cry
that
s
another
of
your
cruel
songs
she
said
learned
it
in
mexico
in
he
talked
easily
it
is
the
song
of
the
gambucinos
you
don
t
know
the
song
of
restless
men
nothing
could
hold
them
in
one
place
not
even
a
woman
you
used
to
meet
one
of
them
now
and
again
in
the
old
days
on
the
edge
of
the
gold
country
away
north
there
beyond
the
rio
gila
i
ve
seen
it
a
prospecting
engineer
in
mazatlan
took
me
along
with
him
to
help
look
after
the
waggons
a
sailor
s
a
handy
chap
to
have
about
you
anyhow
it
s
all
a
desert
cracks
in
the
earth
that
you
can
t
see
the
bottom
of
and
mountains
sheer
rocks
standing
up
high
like
walls
and
church
spires
only
a
hundred
times
bigger
the
valleys
are
full
of
boulders
and
black
stones
there
s
not
a
blade
of
grass
to
see
and
the
sun
sets
more
red
over
that
country
than
i
have
seen
it
anywhere
and
angry
it
you
do
not
want
to
go
back
there
again
she
stammered
out
he
laughed
a
little
no
that
s
the
blamed
gold
country
it
gave
me
the
shivers
sometimes
to
look
at
it
and
we
were
a
big
lot
of
men
together
mind
but
these
gambucinos
wandered
alone
they
knew
that
country
before
anybody
had
ever
heard
of
it
they
had
a
sort
of
gift
for
prospecting
and
the
fever
of
it
was
on
them
too
and
they
did
not
seem
to
want
the
gold
very
much
they
would
find
some
rich
spot
and
then
turn
their
backs
on
it
pick
up
perhaps
a
little
enough
for
a
spree
and
then
be
off
again
looking
for
more
they
never
stopped
long
where
there
were
houses
they
had
no
wife
no
chick
no
home
never
a
chum
you
couldn
t
be
friends
with
a
gambucino
they
were
too
restless
here
and
gone
god
knows
where
they
told
no
one
of
their
finds
and
there
has
never
been
a
gambucino
well
off
it
was
not
for
the
gold
they
cared
it
was
the
wandering
about
looking
for
it
in
the
stony
country
that
got
into
them
and
wouldn
t
let
them
rest
so
that
no
woman
yet
born
could
hold
a
gambucino
for
more
than
a
week
that
s
what
the
song
says
it
s
all
about
a
pretty
girl
that
tried
hard
to
keep
hold
of
a
gambucino
lover
so
that
he
should
bring
her
lots
of
gold
no
fear
off
he
went
and
she
never
saw
him
what
became
of
her
she
breathed
out
the
song
don
t
tell
cried
a
bit
i
daresay
they
were
the
fellows
kiss
and
go
but
it
s
the
looking
for
a
thing
a
something
sometimes
i
think
i
am
a
sort
of
gambucino
no
woman
can
hold
you
then
she
began
in
a
brazen
voice
which
quavered
suddenly
before
the
end
no
longer
than
a
week
he
joked
playing
upon
her
very
heartstrings
with
the
gay
tender
note
of
his
laugh
and
yet
i
am
fond
of
them
all
anything
for
a
woman
of
the
right
sort
the
scrapes
they
got
me
into
and
the
scrapes
they
got
me
out
of
i
love
them
at
first
sight
i
ve
fallen
in
love
with
you
already
miss
bessie
s
your
name
eh
she
backed
away
a
little
and
with
a
trembling
laugh
you
haven
t
seen
my
face
he
bent
forward
gallantly
a
little
pale
it
suits
some
but
you
are
a
fine
figure
of
a
girl
miss
she
was
all
in
a
flutter
nobody
had
ever
said
so
much
to
her
before
his
tone
changed
i
am
getting
middling
hungry
though
had
no
breakfast
couldn
t
you
scare
up
some
bread
from
that
tea
for
me
or
she
was
gone
already
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
asking
her
to
let
him
come
inside
no
matter
anywhere
would
do
devil
of
a
fix
what
would
his
chum
think
i
didn
t
ask
you
as
a
beggar
he
said
jestingly
taking
a
piece
of
from
the
plate
she
held
before
him
i
asked
as
a
friend
my
dad
is
rich
you
he
starves
himself
for
your
and
i
have
starved
for
his
whim
he
said
taking
up
another
piece
all
he
has
in
the
world
is
for
you
she
pleaded
yes
if
i
come
here
to
sit
on
it
like
a
dam
toad
in
a
hole
thank
you
and
what
about
the
shovel
eh
he
always
had
a
queer
way
of
showing
his
i
could
bring
him
round
in
a
week
she
suggested
timidly
he
was
too
hungry
to
answer
her
and
holding
the
plate
submissively
to
his
hand
she
began
to
whisper
up
to
him
in
a
quick
panting
voice
he
listened
amazed
eating
slower
and
slower
till
at
last
his
jaws
stopped
altogether
that
s
his
game
is
it
he
said
in
a
rising
tone
of
scathing
contempt
an
ungovernable
movement
of
his
arm
sent
the
plate
flying
out
of
her
fingers
he
shot
out
a
violent
curse
she
shrank
from
him
putting
her
hand
against
the
wall
no
he
raged
he
expects
expects
for
his
rotten
money
who
wants
his
home
mad
not
he
don
t
you
think
he
wants
his
own
way
he
wanted
to
turn
me
into
a
miserable
lawyer
s
clerk
and
now
he
wants
to
make
of
me
a
blamed
tame
rabbit
in
a
cage
of
me
of
me
his
subdued
angry
laugh
frightened
her
now
the
whole
world
ain
t
a
bit
too
big
for
me
to
spread
my
elbows
in
i
can
tell
you
what

your
name

alone
a
dam
parlour
in
a
hutch

looked
out

girl

my
soul
and
do
you
know
the
judy
may
i
ask
she
shook
all
over
with
noiseless
dry
sobs
but
he
was
fuming
and
fretting
too
much
to
notice
her
distress
he
bit
his
thumb
with
rage
at
the
mere
idea
a
window
rattled
up
a
grinning
information
fellow
pronounced
old
hagberd
dogmatically
in
measured
tones
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
seemed
to
bessie
to
make
the
night
itself
mad
to
pour
insanity
and
disaster
on
the
earth
now
i
know
what
s
wrong
with
the
people
here
my
dear
why
of
course
with
this
mad
chap
going
about
don
t
you
have
anything
to
do
with
him
bessie
bessie
i
say
they
stood
as
if
dumb
the
old
man
fidgeted
and
mumbled
to
himself
at
the
window
suddenly
he
cried
piercingly
bessie
i
see
you
i
ll
tell
she
made
a
movement
as
if
to
run
away
but
stopped
and
raised
her
hands
to
her
temples
young
hagberd
shadowy
and
big
stirred
no
more
than
a
man
of
bronze
over
their
heads
the
crazy
night
whimpered
and
scolded
in
an
old
man
s
voice
send
him
away
my
dear
he
s
only
a
vagabond
what
you
want
is
a
good
home
of
your
own
that
chap
has
no
home
he
s
not
like
harry
he
can
t
be
harry
harry
is
coming
do
you
hear
one
day
more
he
babbled
more
excitedly
never
you
fear
harry
shall
marry
his
voice
rose
very
shrill
and
mad
against
the
regular
deep
soughing
of
the
swell
coiling
heavily
about
the
outer
face
of
the
he
will
have
to
i
shall
make
him
or
if
not
he
swore
a
great
oath
i
ll
cut
him
off
with
a
shilling
and
leave
everything
to
you
i
shall
to
you
let
him
the
window
rattled
down
harry
drew
a
deep
breath
and
took
one
step
toward
bessie
so
it
s
you
the
girl
he
said
in
a
lowered
voice
she
had
not
moved
and
she
remained
half
turned
away
from
him
pressing
her
head
in
the
palms
of
her
hands
my
word
he
continued
with
an
invisible
on
his
lips
i
have
a
great
mind
to
stop
her
elbows
were
trembling
violently
for
a
week
he
finished
without
a
pause
she
clapped
her
hands
to
her
face
he
came
up
quite
close
and
took
hold
of
her
wrists
gently
she
felt
his
breath
on
her
ear
it
s
a
scrape
i
am
in
this
and
it
is
you
that
must
see
me
he
was
trying
to
uncover
her
face
she
resisted
he
let
her
go
then
and
stepping
back
a
little
have
you
got
any
money
he
asked
i
must
be
off
she
nodded
quickly
her
shamefaced
head
and
he
waited
looking
away
from
her
while
trembling
all
over
and
bowing
her
neck
she
tried
to
find
the
pocket
of
her
dress
here
it
is
she
whispered
oh
go
away
go
away
for
god
s
sake
if
i
had
more
more
i
would
give
it
all
to
forget
to
make
you
he
extended
his
hand
no
fear
i
haven
t
forgotten
a
single
one
of
you
in
the
world
some
gave
me
more
than
money
but
i
am
a
beggar
now
and
you
women
always
had
to
get
me
out
of
my
he
swaggered
up
to
the
parlour
window
and
in
the
dim
light
filtering
through
the
blind
looked
at
the
coin
lying
in
his
palm
it
was
a
he
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
she
stood
a
little
on
one
side
with
her
head
drooping
as
if
wounded
with
her
arms
hanging
passive
by
her
side
as
if
dead
you
can
t
buy
me
in
he
said
and
you
can
t
buy
yourself
he
set
his
hat
firmly
with
a
little
tap
and
next
moment
she
felt
herself
lifted
up
in
the
powerful
embrace
of
his
arms
her
feet
lost
the
ground
her
head
hung
back
he
showered
kisses
on
her
face
with
a
silent
and
ardour
as
if
in
haste
to
get
at
her
very
soul
he
kissed
her
pale
cheeks
her
hard
forehead
her
heavy
eyelids
her
faded
lips
and
the
measured
blows
and
sighs
of
the
rising
tide
accompanied
the
enfolding
power
of
his
arms
the
overwhelming
might
of
his
caresses
it
was
as
if
the
sea
breaking
down
the
wall
protecting
all
the
homes
of
the
town
had
sent
a
wave
over
her
head
it
passed
on
she
staggered
backwards
with
her
shoulders
against
the
wall
exhausted
as
if
she
had
been
stranded
there
after
a
storm
and
a
shipwreck
she
opened
her
eyes
after
awhile
and
listening
to
the
firm
leisurely
footsteps
going
away
with
their
conquest
began
to
gather
her
skirts
staring
all
the
time
before
her
suddenly
she
darted
through
the
open
gate
into
the
dark
and
deserted
street
stop
she
shouted
don
t
go
and
listening
with
an
attentive
poise
of
the
head
she
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
the
beat
of
the
swell
or
his
fateful
tread
that
seemed
to
fall
cruelly
upon
her
heart
presently
every
sound
grew
fainter
as
though
she
were
slowly
turning
into
stone
a
fear
of
this
awful
silence
came
to
her
worse
than
the
fear
of
death
she
called
upon
her
ebbing
strength
for
the
final
appeal
harry
not
even
the
dying
echo
of
a
footstep
nothing
the
thundering
of
the
surf
the
voice
of
the
restless
sea
itself
seemed
stopped
there
was
not
a
sound
no
whisper
of
life
as
though
she
were
alone
and
lost
in
that
stony
country
of
which
she
had
heard
where
madmen
go
looking
for
gold
and
spurn
the
find
captain
hagberd
inside
his
dark
house
had
kept
on
the
alert
a
window
ran
up
and
in
the
silence
of
the
stony
country
a
voice
spoke
above
her
head
high
up
in
the
black
air
the
voice
of
madness
lies
and
despair
the
voice
of
inextinguishable
hope
is
he
gone
yet
that
information
fellow
do
you
hear
him
about
my
dear
she
burst
into
tears
no
no
no
i
don
t
hear
him
any
more
she
sobbed
he
began
to
chuckle
up
there
triumphantly
you
frightened
him
away
good
girl
now
we
shall
be
all
right
don
t
you
be
impatient
my
dear
one
day
in
the
other
house
old
carvil
wallowing
regally
in
his
with
a
globe
lamp
burning
by
his
side
on
the
table
yelled
for
her
in
a
fiendish
voice
bessie
bessie
you
bessie
she
heard
him
at
last
and
as
if
overcome
by
fate
began
to
totter
silently
back
toward
her
stuffy
little
inferno
of
a
cottage
it
had
no
lofty
portal
no
terrific
inscription
of
forfeited
hopes
she
did
not
understand
wherein
she
had
sinned
captain
hagberd
had
gradually
worked
himself
into
a
state
of
noisy
happiness
up
there
go
in
keep
quiet
she
turned
upon
him
tearfully
from
the
doorstep
below
he
rebelled
against
her
authority
in
his
great
joy
at
having
got
rid
at
last
of
that
something
it
was
as
if
all
the
hopeful
madness
of
the
world
had
broken
out
to
bring
terror
upon
her
heart
with
the
voice
of
that
old
man
shouting
of
his
trust
in
an
everlasting
