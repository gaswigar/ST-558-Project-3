this

contains
the
first
three
and
half

from
michael
i
changed
a
few
spaces
here
and
there
to
make
it
look
better
onscreen
let
me
know
if
you
have
any
suggestions
corrections
additions
etc
from
jude
orright
michael
i
played
with
the
formatting
it
hell
to
make
things
look
good
in
ascii
but
it
looks
bettah
okay
michael
stand
back
here
it
comes
i
sending
cybpunk
fakebook
as
a
attachment
and
a
look
out
it
terribly
silly
dear
michael
hart
and
project
gutenberg
this
text
comes
over
a
little
odd
in
ascii
like
the
zine
we
made
infamous
this
book
relies
on
its
wacked
layout
and
bizarre
illustrations
for
much
of
its
meaning
not
to
say
charm
and
it
was
difficult
to
figure
what
should
be
considered
the
first
chapter
for
obvious
reasons
i
think
the
first
chapter
really
includes
section
ii
but
never
mind
here
it
is
the
beginning
of
the
real
cyberpunk
fakebook
by
jude
and
bart
nagel
dedication
for
all
our
parents
and
lovers
and
housemates
and
children

introduction
to
the
real
cyberpunk
fakebook
by
bruce
sterling
a
renowned
cyberpunk
writer
i
like
this
book
so
much
that
i
thinking
of
changing
my
name
to
you
could
ask
for
better
guides
to
faking
cyberpunk
than
these
two
utterly
accomplished
bay
area
fraudsters
these
two
characters
are
such
consummate
boho
hustlers
that
they
make
aleister
crowley
look
like
rebecca
of
sunnybrook
farm
i
do
believe
in
smart
drugs
and
i
never
believed
in
smart
drugs
but
i
do
believe
the
following
genuinely
useful
to
society
to
have
some
small
contained
fraction
of
reckless
fools
who
are
willing
to
consume
untested
and
unknown
devices
and
substances
sure
most
of
them
will
have
their
hearts
explode
or
break
out
into
great
purple
bleeding
thalidomide
warts
but
who
knows
maybe
someday
one
of
these
jaspers
will
be
eating
handfuls
of
psychoactive
crap
out
of
some
hippie
pharmacy
and
he
or
she
will
suddenly
learn
to
read
japanese
in
the
original
in
six
days
that
not
at
all
likely
but
it
could
happen
grant
me
the
possibility
the
only
drawback
to
this
decentralized
libertarian
regime
of
biomedical
research
is
that
you
have
to
be
ruthlessly
prepared
to
sacrifice
certain
people
just
write
off
basically
like
a
cageful
of
control
hamsters
down
at
the
nimh
and
if
i
ever
met
a
man
uniquely
suited
to
this
particular
role
in
life
it
is
sirius
sirius
basically
resembles
gomez
addams
in
a
purple
fedora
with
an
andy
warhol
badge
pinned
to
the
brim
the
moment
i
met
i
felt
a
strong
need
to
pith
him
and
examine
his
viscera
i
sure
there
are
many
other
freelance
biomedical
researchers
who
will
feel
the
same
intellectual
impulse
read
this
book
and
you
see
what
i
mean
then
there
this
saint
person
never
draw
to
an
inside
straight
never
eat
at
a
place
called
mom
and
never
eat
a
bag
of
ephedrine
and
a
pumpkin
pie
the
of
vegetables
from
a
california
blonde
who
does
even
have
a
real
name
this
female
personage
is
so
appallingly
cagey
that
even
her
main
squeeze
delights
in
cryptographically
baffling
the
nsa
if
pat
buchanan
ever
gets
his
secret
wish
and
sets
up
a
domestic
american
gulag
for
counterculture
the
judester
gon
na
be
way
up
on
the
list
maybe
even
number
two
right
after
bob
dobbs
her
trial
likely
to
prove
rather
interesting
however
as
she
only
commits
crimes
in
areas
of
social
activity
that
have
even
been
defined
yet
much
less
successfully
criminalized
a
serious
legal
study
of
this
woman
spectrum
of
activities
would
be
like
a
of
the
american
unconscious
there
also
bart
nagel
who
is
too
nice
a
guy
to
be
in
the
company
of
these
people
almost
everything
in
this
swell
book
is
completely
true
except
for
everything
about
me
and
my
closest
conspirators
we
actual
cyberpunks
by
this
i
mean
fiction
dammit
the
people
for
whom
the
was
invented
the
people
who
were
professionally
ahead
of
our
time
and
were
cyberpunks
years
we
never
sneer
and
we
never
dress
like
god
forbid
tom
wolfe
we
just
laugh
at
inappropriate
times
like
when
testifying
in
congress
and
we
dress
and
act
just
like
industrial
design
professors
i
hope
this
brief
intro
clears
up
any
confusion
if
you
have
any
trouble
at
all
with
this
book
take
full
advantage
of
your
online
and
send
email
do
be
afraid
to
ask
stupid
questions
that
what
the
internet
is
for
ask
nice
big
broad
questions
stuff
like
doing
a
term
paper
so
please
tell
me
everything
you
know
about
cyberspace
or
i
cyberpunk
fan
from
bulgaria
and
enlgish
not
too
good
but
please
say
more
what
is
about
virtual
reality
just
do
send
the
email
to
me
of
course
send
email
to
them
after
this
book
they
deserve
it
i
feel
sure
that
you
get
prompt
answers
that
will
surprise
you
the
authors
explain
a
technical

words

ascii

these
are

that
are
defined
in
your
cyber
word
check
there
for
anything
that
baffles
you
sometimes
there
a
term
in
the
text
that
refers
to
a
chapter
subheading
and
then
you
must
practice
your
haqr
smarts
in
order
to
find
it
if
all
else
fails
you
could
ask
bruce
sterling
at
his
secret
email
address
bruces
he
will
know
the
shuriken
awards
we
may
sometimes
succumb
to
the
temptation
to
rate
things
the
way
snotty
critics
do
by
awarding
stars
however
we
will
award
them
as
a
cyber
kinda
star

a
shuriken

the

itself
as

a

you

guide
to
the
cybertypes
recognizing

and
fitting
in
while
a
cyberpunk
is
commonly
a
middleclass
white
male
with
way
too
many
electrons
there
are
varieties
of
cyberpunk
underlying
all
the
types
and
genres
is
basic
cyber
style
which
breaks
down
to
physical
gear
and
mental
attitude
basic
cyberpunk
gear
is
simple
black
leather
jacket
boots
mirrorshades
laser
pointer
we
do
know
why
all
cyberpunks
need
a
laser
pointer
but
it
mandatory
we
give
you
a
more
elaborate
guide
to
basic
cyberpunk
gear
later
the
basic
cyberpunk
attitude
is
quiet
assurance
subdued
swashbuckling
maybe
a
little
menace
with
these
cyberpunk
basics
you
can
navigate
through
all
the
but
if
you
want
to
pass
as
a
native
in
a
particular
cyber
without
getting
jeered
at

beaten
up
you
got
ta
accessorize

pay
close
attention

pack
the
mystique
of
both
worlds
high
tech
and
big
greasy
loud

standard
cyberpunk
costume
is
ideal
for
riding
motorcycles
and
a
mirrorshades
helmet
is
a
big
plus
for
the
cyber
look
mega
robotic
coolness
motorcycles
are
dangerous
and
can
kill
you
this
is
also
cool
goths
deathcore
and
ideally
for
this
you
should
know
about
the
cure
which
is
a
band
to
fit
in
grow
your
hair
big
and
dye
it
blueblack
spray
it
with
aquanet
white
to
make
it
stick

and
buy
plastic
fangs
the
kind
that
glow
in

dark
are
funny
funny
is
not
the
object
here
all
sexes
should
wear
a
victorian
shirt
blouse
white
or
black
only
that
gapes
to
show
flesh
you
must
practice
looking
tormented
tall

thin

ideal
is

makeup

blueblack
eyesockets
blueblack
makeup
with
white
eyesockets
is
untested
but
might
work
very
well
if
you
avoid

torment
torment

ironic
bitterness
no
giggling

grrrls
these
are

this
is
a

category
but
there
we
are
girls
only
a
grrrl
can
be
called
and
guy
at
all
times
but
a
guy
is
not
a
grrrl
this
is
just
the
way
things
are
if
you
a
grrrl
you
can
wear
anything
you
want
to
because
you
there
to
defend
it
this
is
true
for
anybody
really
look
as
tough
as
you
wanta
be
and
be
ready
to
back
it
up
fierce
is
good
grrrls
with
tech
expertise
are
irresistible
nothing
is
more
attractive
than
a
fierce
blazing
grrrl
right
now
and
if

is

do
worry

you
can
dress
any
old
way
and
fit
