preface
to

fourth
edition
the
chief
alterations
since
the
first
edition
have
been
made
in
the
chapter
on
pp
and
the
book
on
pp
to
the
chief
additions
have
been
the
questions
on
words
and
phrases
added
to
the
at
and
the
notes
inserted
at
pp
in
book
i
chapter
ii
i
have
adopted
a
new
definition
of
which
enables
me
to
regard
the
whole
universe
as
a
and
thus
to
dispense
with
the
very
awkward
phrase
set
of
things
in
the
chapter
on
of
existence
i
have
adopted
a
new
form
in
which
the
class
whose
existence
is
affirmed
or
denied
is
regarded
as
the
instead
of
the
of
the
proposition
thus
evading
a
very
subtle
difficulty
which
besets
the
other
form
these
subtle
difficulties
seem
to
lie
at
the
root
of
every
tree
of
knowledge
and
they
are
more
hopeless
to
grapple
with
than
any
that
occur
in
its
higher
branches
for
example
the
difficulties
of
the
proposition
of
euclid
are
mere
child
play
compared
with
the
mental
torture
endured
in
the
effort
to
think
out
the
essential
nature
of
a
straight
line
and
in
the
present
work
the
difficulties
of
the
liars
problem
at
are
trifles
light
as
air
compared
with
the
bewildering
question
what
is
a
thing
in
the
chapter
on
of
relation
i
have
inserted
a
new
section
containing
the
proof
that
a
proposition
beginning
with
all
is
a
proposition
a
fact
that
is
quite
independent
of
the
arbitrary
rule
laid
down
in
the
next
section
that
such
a
proposition
is
to
be
understood
as
implying
the
actual
of
its
subject
this
proof
was
given
in
the
earlier
editions
incidentally
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
of
the
biliteral
diagram
but
its
place
in
this
treatise
is
where
i
have
now
introduced
it
in
the
i
have
made
a
good
many
verbal
alterations
in
order
to
evade
a
difficulty
which
i
fear
will
have
perplexed
some
of
the
readers
of
the
first
three
editions
some
of
the
premisses
were
so
worded
that
their
terms
were
not
specieses
of
the
univ
named
in
the
dictionary
but
of
a
larger
class
of
which
the
univ
was
only
a
portion
in
all
such
cases
it
was
intended
that
the
reader
should
perceive
that
what
was
asserted
of
the
larger
class
was
thereby
asserted
of
the
and
should
ignore
as
superfluous
all
that
it
asserted
of
its
portion
thus
in
ex
the
univ
was
stated
to
be
ducks
in
this
village
and
the
third
premiss
was
mrs
bond
has
no
gray
ducks
no
gray
ducks
are
ducks
belonging
to
mrs
bond
here
the
terms
are
specieses
of
the
but
of
the
larger
class
ducks
of
which
the
univ
is
only
a
portion
and
it
was
intended
that
the
reader
should
perceive
that
what
is
here
asserted
of
ducks
is
thereby
asserted
of
ducks
in
this
village
and
should
treat
this
premiss
as
if
it
were
mrs
bond
has
no
gray
ducks
in
this
village
and
should
ignore
as
superfluous
what
it
asserts
as
to
the
portion
of
the
class
ducks
viz
mrs
bond
has
no
gray
ducks
this
village
in
the
appendix
i
have
given
a
new
version
of
the
problem
of
the
five
liars
my
object
in
doing
so
is
to
escape
the
subtle
and
mysterious
difficulties
which
beset
all
attempts
at
regarding
a
proposition
as
being
its
own
subject
or
a
set
of
propositions
as
being
subjects
for
one
another
it
is
certainly
a
most
bewildering
and
unsatisfactory
theory
one
can
not
help
feeling
that
there
is
a
great
lack
of
in
all
this
shadowy
host
that
as
the
procession
of
phantoms
glides
before
us
there
is
not
that
we
can
pounce
upon
and
say
is
a
proposition
that
be
either
true
or
false
that
it
is
but
a
barmecide
feast
to
which
we
have
been
bidden
and
that
its
prototype
is
to
be
found
in
that
mythical
island
whose
inhabitants
earned
a
precarious
living
by
taking
in
each
washing
by
simply
translating
telling
truths
into
taking
of
condiments
salt
and
mustard
telling
lies
into
taking
of
them
and
telling
a
truth
and
a
lie
order
not
specified
into
taking
only
condiment
it
is
not
specified
i
have
escaped
all
those
metaphysical
puzzles
and
have
produced
a
problem
which
when
translated
into
a
set
of
symbolized
premisses
furnishes
the
very
same
as
were
furnished
by
the
problem
of
the
five
liars
the
coined
words
introduced
in
previous
editions
such
as
eliminands
and
retinends
perhaps
hardly
need
any
apology
they
were
indispensable
to
my
system
but
the
new
plural
here
used
for
the
first
time
viz
soriteses
will
i
fear
be
condemned
as
bad
english
unless
i
say
a
word
in
its
defence
we
have
singular
nouns
in
english
of
plural
series
species
and
sorites
in
all
three
the
awkwardness
of
using
the
same
word
for
both
singular
and
plural
must
often
have
been
felt
this
has
been
remedied
in
the
case
of
series
by
coining
the
plural
serieses
which
has
already
found
its
way
into
the
dictionaries
so
i
am
no
rash
innovator
but
am
merely
following
suit
in
using
the
new
plural
soriteses
in
conclusion
let
me
point
out
that
even
those
who
are
obliged
to
study
logic
with
a
view
to
being
able
to
answer
in
that
subject
will
find
the
study
of
logic
most
helpful
for
this
purpose
in
throwing
light
upon
many
of
the
obscurities
with
which
formal
logic
abounds
and
in
furnishing
a
delightfully
easy
method
of
the
results
arrived
at
by
the
cumbrous
processes
which
formal
logic
enforces
upon
its
votaries
this
is
i
believe
the
very
first
attempt
with
the
exception
of
my
own
little
book
game
of
published
in
a
very
incomplete
performance
that
has
been
made
to
this
fascinating
subject
it
has
cost
me
of
hard
work
but
if
it
should
prove
as
i
hope
it
may
to
be
of
service
to
the
young
and
to
be
taken
up
in
high
schools
and
in
private
families
as
a
valuable
addition
to
their
stock
of
healthful
mental
recreations
such
a
result
would
more
than
repay
ten
times
the
labour
that
i
have
expended
on
it
bedford
street
strand
introduction
some
remarks
addressed
to
will
be
found
in
the
appendix
at
p
the
learner
who
wishes
to
try
the
question
whether
this
little
book
does
or
does
not
supply
the
materials
for
a
most
interesting
mental
recreation
is
advised
to
adopt
the
following
rules
begin
at
the
and
do
not
allow
yourself
to
gratify
a
mere
idle
curiosity
by
dipping
into
the
book
here
and
there
this
would
very
likely
lead
to
your
throwing
it
aside
with
the
remark
this
is
too
hard
for
me
and
thus
losing
the
chance
of
adding
a
very
item
to
your
stock
of
mental
delights
this
rule
of
not
is
very
with
kinds
of
books
such
as
novels
for
instance
where
you
may
easily
spoil
much
of
the
enjoyment
you
would
otherwise
get
from
the
story
by
dipping
into
it
further
on
so
that
what
the
author
meant
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
comes
to
you
as
a
matter
of
course
some
people
i
know
make
a
practice
of
looking
into
vol
iii
first
just
to
see
how
the
story
ends
and
perhaps
it
as
well
just
to
know
that
all
ends
that
the
lovers
marry
after
all
that
he
is
proved
to
be
quite
innocent
of
the
murder
that
the
wicked
cousin
is
completely
foiled
in
his
plot
and
gets
the
punishment
he
deserves
and
that
the
rich
uncle
in
india
why
in
because
somehow
uncles
never
get
rich
anywhere
else
dies
at
exactly
the
right
moment
before
taking
the
trouble
to
read
vol
i
this
i
say
is
permissible
with
a
where
vol
iii
has
a
even
for
those
who
have
not
read
the
earlier
part
of
the
story
but
with
a
book
it
is
sheer
insanity
you
will
find
the
latter
part
unintelligible
if
you
read
it
before
reaching
it
in
regular
course
do
begin
any
fresh
chapter
or
section
until
you
are
certain
that
you
understand
the
whole
book
to
that
and
that
you
have
worked
correctly
most
if
not
all
of
the
examples
which
have
been
set
so
long
as
you
are
conscious
that
all
the
land
you
have
passed
through
is
absolutely
and
that
you
are
leaving
no
unsolved
difficulties
you
which
will
be
sure
to
turn
up
again
later
on
your
triumphal
progress
will
be
easy
and
delightful
otherwise
you
will
find
your
state
of
puzzlement
get
worse
and
worse
as
you
proceed
till
you
give
up
the
whole
thing
in
utter
disgust
when
you
come
to
any
passage
you
do
understand
it
if
you
do
understand
it
it
if
you
fail
even
after
readings
very
likely
your
brain
is
getting
a
little
tired
in
that
case
put
the
book
away
and
take
to
other
occupations
and
next
day
when
you
come
to
it
fresh
you
will
very
likely
find
that
it
is
easy
if
possible
find
some
genial
friend
who
will
read
the
book
along
with
you
and
will
talk
over
the
difficulties
with
you
is
a
wonderful
of
difficulties
when
come
upon
anything
in
logic
or
in
any
other
hard
subject
that
entirely
puzzles
me
i
find
it
a
capital
plan
to
talk
it
over
even
when
i
am
all
alone
one
can
explain
things
so
to
one
self
and
then
you
know
one
is
so
with
one
self
one
gets
irritated
at
one
own
stupidity
if
dear
reader
you
will
faithfully
observe
these
rules
and
so
give
my
little
book
a
really
trial
i
promise
you
most
confidently
that
you
will
find
symbolic
logic
to
be
one
of
the
most
if
not
most
fascinating
of
mental
recreations
in
this
first
part
i
have
carefully
avoided
all
difficulties
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
beyond
the
grasp
of
an
intelligent
child
of
say
twelve
or
fourteen
years
of
age
i
have
myself
taught
most
of
its
contents
to
children
and
have
found
them
take
a
real
intelligent
interest
in
the
subject
for
those
who
succeed
in
mastering
part
i
and
who
begin
like
oliver
asking
for
more
i
hope
to
provide
in
part
ii
some
hard
nuts
to
crack
nuts
that
will
require
all
the
they
happen
to
possess
mental
recreation
is
a
thing
that
we
all
of
us
need
for
our
mental
health
and
you
may
get
much
healthy
enjoyment
no
doubt
from
games
such
as
chess
and
the
new
game
halma
but
after
all
when
you
have
made
yourself
a
player
at
any
one
of
these
games
you
have
nothing
real
to
for
it
as
a
you
enjoyed
the
game
and
the
victory
no
doubt
the
but
you
have
no
that
you
can
treasure
up
and
get
real
out
of
and
all
the
while
you
have
been
leaving
unexplored
a
perfect
of
wealth
once
master
the
machinery
of
symbolic
logic
and
you
have
a
mental
occupation
always
at
hand
of
absorbing
interest
and
one
that
will
be
of
real
to
you
in
subject
you
may
take
up
it
will
give
you
clearness
of
thought
the
ability
to
your
through
a
puzzle
the
habit
of
arranging
your
ideas
in
an
orderly
and
form
and
more
valuable
than
all
the
power
to
detect
and
to
tear
to
pieces
the
flimsy
illogical
arguments
which
you
will
so
continually
encounter
in
books
in
newspapers
in
speeches
and
even
in

and
which
so
easily
delude
those
who

never

one

may

thus
the

a

may

a

this
word
is
introduced
in
order
to
avoid

of

we

we
may

chapter
ii
or
the
formation
of
classes
is
a
mental
process
in
which
we
imagine
that
we
have
put
together
in
a
group
certain
things
such
a
group
is
called
a
this
process
may
be
performed
in
three
different
ways
as
follows
we
may
imagine
that
we
have
put
together
all
things
the
class
so
formed
the
class
things
contains
the
whole
universe
we
may
think
of
the
class
things
and
may
imagine
that
we
have
picked
out
from
it
all
the
things
which
possess
a
certain
adjunct
possessed
by
the
whole
class
this
adjunct
is
said
to
be
to
the
class
so
formed
in
this
case
the
class
things
is
called
a
with
regard
to
the
class
so
formed
the
class
so
formed
is
called
a
of
the
class
things
and
its
peculiar
adjunct
is
called
its
as
this
process
is
entirely
we
can
perform
it
whether
there
or
an
thing
which
possesses
that
adjunct
if
there
the
class
is
said
to
be
if
not
it
is
said
to
be
or
for
example
we
may
imagine
that
we
have
picked
out
from
the
class
things
all
the
things
which
possess
the
adjunct
material
artificial
consisting
of
houses
and
streets
and
we
may
thus
form
the
real
class
towns
here
we
may
regard
things
as
a
towns
as
a
of
things
and
material
artificial
consisting
of
houses
and
streets
as
its
again
we
may
imagine
that
we
have
picked
out
all
the
things
which
possess
the
adjunct
weighing
a
ton
easily
lifted
by
a
baby
and
we
may
thus
form
the
class
things
that
weigh
a
ton
and
are
easily
lifted
by
a
baby
we
may
think
of
a
certain
class
the
class
things
and
may
imagine
that
we
have
picked
out
from
it
all
the
members
of
it
which
possess
a
certain
adjunct
possessed
by
the
whole
class
this
adjunct
is
said
to
be
to
the
smaller
class
so
formed
in
this
case
the
class
thought
of
is
called
a
with
regard
to
the
smaller
class
picked
out
from
it
the
smaller
class
is
called
a
of
the
larger
and
its
peculiar
adjunct
is
called
its
for
example
we
may
think
of
the
class
towns
and
imagine
that
we
have
picked
out
from
it
all
the
towns
which
possess
the
attribute
lit
with
gas
and
we
may
thus
form
the
real
class
towns
lit
with
gas
here
we
may
regard
towns
as
a
towns
lit
with
gas
as
a
of
towns
and
lit
with
gas
as
its
if
in
the
above
example
we
were
to
alter
lit
with
gas
into
paved
with
gold
we
should
get
the
class
towns
paved
with
gold
a
class
containing
only
member
is
called
an
for
example
the
class
towns
having
four
million
inhabitants
which
class
contains
only
member
viz
london
hence
any
single
thing
which
we
can
name
so
as
to
distinguish
it
from
all
other
things
may
be
regarded
as
a
class
thus
london
may
be
regarded
as
the
class
picked
out
from
the
class
towns
which
has
as
its
differentia
having
four
million
inhabitants
a
class
containing
two
or
more
members
is
sometimes
regarded
as
single
when
so
regarded
it
may
possess
an
adjunct
which
is
possessed
by
any
member
of
it
taken
separately
thus
the
class
the
soldiers
of
the
tenth
regiment
when
regarded
as
single
may
possess
the
attribute
formed
in
square
which
is
possessed
by
any
member
of
it
taken
separately
chapter
iii
is
a
mental
process
in
which
we
think
of
a
certain
class
of
things
and
imagine
that
we
have
divided
it
into
two
or
more
smaller
classes
thus
we
might
think
of
the
class
books
and
imagine
that
we
had
divided
it
into
the
two
smaller
classes
bound
books
and
unbound
books
or
into
the
three
classes
books
priced
at
less
than
a
shilling
books
priced
at
more
than
a
shilling
or
into
the
classes
books
whose
names
begin
with
books
whose
names
begin
with
a
class
that
has
been
obtained
by
a
certain
division
is
said
to
be
with
every
class
obtained
by
that
division
thus
the
class
bound
books
is
codivisional
with
each
of
the
two
classes
bound
books
and
unbound
books
similarly
the
battle
of
waterloo
may
be
said
to
have
been
contemporary
with
every
event
that
happened
in
hence
a
class
obtained
by
division
is
codivisional
with
itself
thus
the
class
bound
books
is
codivisional
with
itself
similarly
the
battle
of
waterloo
may
be
said
to
have
been
contemporary
with
itself
if
we
think
of
a
certain
class
and
imagine
that
we
have
picked
out
from
it
a
certain
smaller
class
it
is
evident
that
the
of
the
large
class
does
possess
the
differentia
of
that
smaller
class
hence
it
may
be
regarded
as
smaller
class
whose
differentia
may
be
formed
from
that
of
the
class
first
picked
out
by
prefixing
the
word
not
and
we
may
imagine
that
we
have
the
class
first
thought
of
into
smaller
classes
whose
differentiæ
are
this
kind
of
division
is
called
for
example
we
may
divide
books
into
the
two
classes
whose
differentiæ
are
old
and
in
performing
this
process
we
may
sometimes
find
that
the
attributes
we
have
chosen
are
used
so
loosely
in
ordinary
conversation
that
it
is
not
easy
to
decide
of
the
things
belong
to
the
one
class
and
to
the
other
in
such
a
case
it
would
be
necessary
to
lay
down
some
arbitrary
as
to
the
one
class
should
end
and
the
other
begin
thus
in
dividing
books
into
old
and
we
may
say
let
all
books
printed
before
be
regarded
as
and
all
others
as
henceforwards
let
it
be
understood
that
if
a
class
of
things
be
divided
into
two
classes
whose
differentiæ
have
contrary
meanings
each
differentia
is
to
be
regarded
as
equivalent
to
the
other
with
the
word
not
prefixed
thus
if
books
be
divided
into
old
and
new
the
attribute
old
is
to
be
regarded
as
equivalent
to
and
the
attribute
new
as
equivalent
to
after
dividing
a
class
by
the
process
of
into
two
smaller
classes
we
may
each
of
these
into
two
still
smaller
classes
and
this
process
may
be
repeated
over
and
over
again
the
number
of
classes
being
doubled
at
each
repetition
for
example
we
may
divide
books
into
old
and
new
we
may
then
each
of
these
into
english
and
foreign
thus
getting
classes
viz
old
english
old
foreign
new
english
new
foreign
if
we
had
begun
by
dividing
into
english
and
foreign
and
had
then
into
old
and
new
the
four
classes
would
have
been
english
old
english
new
foreign
old
foreign
new
the
reader
will
easily
see
that
these
are
the
very
same
four
classes
which
we
had
before
chapter
iv
the
word
thing
which
conveys
the
idea
of
a
thing
any
idea
of
an
adjunct
represents
single
thing
any
other
word
or
phrase
which
conveys
the
idea
of
a
thing
the
idea
of
an
adjunct
represents
thing
which
possesses
that
adjunct
it
represents
any
member
of
the
class
to
which
that
adjunct
is
such
a
word
or
phrase
is
called
a
and
if
there
be
an
existing
thing
which
it
represents
it
is
said
to
be
a
name
of
that
thing
for
example
the
words
thing
treasure
town
and
the
phrases
valuable
thing
material
artificial
thing
consisting
of
houses
and
streets
town
lit
with
gas
town
paved
with
gold
old
english
book
just
as
a
class
is
said
to
be
or
according
as
there
or
an
existing
thing
in
it
so
also
a
name
is
said
to
be
or
according
as
there
or
an
existing
thing
represented
by
it
thus
town
lit
with
gas
is
a
name
town
paved
with
gold
is
an
name
every
name
is
either
a
substantive
only
or
else
a
phrase
consisting
of
a
substantive
and
one
or
more
adjectives
or
phrases
used
as
adjectives
every
name
except
thing
may
usually
be
expressed
in
three
different
forms
the
substantive
thing
and
one
or
more
adjectives
or
phrases
used
as
adjectives
conveying
the
ideas
of
the
attributes
a
substantive
conveying
the
idea
of
a
thing
with
the
ideas
of
of
the
attributes
and
one
or
more
adjectives
or
phrases
used
as
adjectives
conveying
the
ideas
of
the
attributes
a
substantive
conveying
the
idea
of
a
thing
with
the
ideas
of
the
attributes
thus
the
phrase
material
living
thing
belonging
to
the
animal
kingdom
having
two
hands
and
two
feet
is
a
name
expressed
in
form
if
we
choose
to
roll
up
together
the
substantive
thing
and
the
adjectives
material
living
belonging
to
the
animal
kingdom
so
as
to
make
the
new
substantive
animal
we
get
the
phrase
animal
having
two
hands
and
two
feet
which
is
a
name
representing
the
same
thing
as
before
expressed
in
form
and
if
we
choose
to
roll
up
the
whole
phrase
into
one
word
so
as
to
make
the
new
substantive
man
we
get
a
name
still
representing
the
very
same
thing
expressed
in
form
a
name
whose
substantive
is
in
the
number
may
be
used
to
represent
either
members
of
a
class
as
separate
or
a
whole
class
as
one
single
thus
when
i
say
some
soldiers
of
the
tenth
regiment
are
tall
or
the
soldiers
of
the
tenth
regiment
are
brave
i
am
using
the
name
soldiers
of
the
tenth
regiment
in
the
sense
and
it
is
just
the
same
as
if
i
were
to
point
to
each
of
them
and
to
say
soldier
of
the
tenth
regiment
is
tall
soldier
of
the
tenth
regiment
is
tall
and
so
on
but
when
i
say
the
soldiers
of
the
tenth
regiment
are
formed
in
square
i
am
using
the
phrase
in
the
sense
and
it
is
just
the
same
as
if
i
were
to
say
the
is
formed
in
square
chapter
it
is
evident
that
every
member
of
a
is
a
member
of
the
out
of
which
that
species
has
been
picked
and
that
it
possesses
the
of
that
species
hence
it
may
be
represented
by
a
name
consisting
of
two
parts
one
being
a
name
representing
any
member
of
the
and
the
other
being
the
of
that
species
such
a
name
is
called
a
of
any
member
of
that
species
and
to
give
it
such
a
name
is
to
it
thus
we
may
define
a
treasure
as
a
valuable
thing
in
this
case
we
regard
things
as
the
and
valuable
as
the
the
following
examples
of
this
process
may
be
taken
as
models
for
working
others
note
that
in
each
definition
the
substantive
representing
a
member
or
members
of
the
is
printed
in
capitals
define
a

million
inhabitants
or
else
the
town
which
has
four
million
inhabitants
note
that
we
here
use
the
article
the
instead
of
a
because
we
happen
to
know
that
there
is
only
such
thing
the
reader
can
set
himself
any
number
of
examples
of
this
process
by
simply
choosing
the
name
of
any
common
thing
such
as
house
tree
knife
making
a
definition
for
it
and
then
testing
his
answer
by
referring
to
any
english
dictionary

propositions
chapter
i
note
that
the
word
some
is
to
be
regarded
henceforward
as
meaning
one
or
more
the
word
as
used
in
ordinary
conversation
may
be
applied
to
word
or
phrase
which
conveys
any
information
whatever
thus
the
words
yes
and
no
are
propositions
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
and
so
are
the
phrases
you
owe
me
five
farthings
and
i
do
such
words
as
oh
or
never
and
such
phrases
as
fetch
me
that
book
which
book
do
you
mean
do
not
seem
at
first
sight
to
convey
any
but
they
can
easily
be
turned
into
equivalent
forms
which
do
so
viz
i
am
surprised
i
will
never
consent
to
it
i
order
you
to
fetch
me
that
book
i
want
to
know
which
book
you
mean
but
a
as
used
in
this
first
part
of
symbolic
logic
has
a
peculiar
form
which
may
be
called
its
and
if
any
proposition
which
we
wish
to
use
in
an
argument
is
not
in
normal
form
we
must
reduce
it
to
such
a
form
before
we
can
use
it
a
when
in
normal
form
asserts
as
to
certain
two
classes
which
are
called
its
and
either
that
members
of
its
subject
are
members
of
its
predicate
or
that
members
of
its
subject
are
members
of
its
predicate
or
that
members
of
its
subject
are
members
of
its
predicate
the
subject
and
the
predicate
of
a
proposition
are
called
its
two
propositions
which
convey
the
information
are
said
to
be
thus
the
two
propositions
i
see
john
and
john
is
seen
by
me
are
equivalent
form
of
a
a
proposition
in
normal
form
consists
of
four
parts
the
word
some
or
no
or
all
this
word
which
tells
us
members
of
the
subject
are
also
members
of
the
predicate
is
called
the
of
name
of
subject
the
verb
are
or
is
this
is
called
the
name
of
predicate
kinds
of
a
proposition
that
begins
with
some
is
said
to
be
it
is
also
called
proposition
note
that
it
is
called
because
it
refers
to
a
only
of
the
subject
a
proposition
that
begins
with
no
is
said
to
be
it
is
also
called
proposition
a
proposition
that
begins
with
all
is
said
to
be
it
is
also
called
proposition
note
that
they
are
called
because
they
refer
to
the
of
the
subject
a
proposition
whose
subject
is
an
is
to
be
regarded
as
let
us
take
as
an
example
the
proposition
john
is
not
well
this
of
course
implies
that
there
is
an
to
whom
the
speaker
refers
when
he
mentions
john
and
whom
the
listener
to
be
referred
to
hence
the
class
men
referred
to
by
the
speaker
when
he
mentions
is
a
class
and
the
proposition
is
equivalent
to
the
men
who
are
referred
to
by
the
speaker
when
he
mentions
are
not
well
propositions
are
of
two
kinds
of
existence
and
of
relation
these
shall
be
discussed
separately
chapter
ii
of
a
of
when
in
normal
form
has
for
its
the
class
existing
things
its
sign
of
quantity
is
some
or
no
note
that
though
its
sign
of
quantity
tells
us
existing
things
are
members
of
its
predicate
it
does
tell
us
the
number
in
fact
it
only
deals
with
numbers
which
are
in
ascending
order
and
or
more
it
is
called
a
proposition
of
existence
because
its
effect
is
to
assert
the
the
real
or
else
the
of
its
predicate
thus
the
proposition
some
existing
things
are
honest
men
asserts
that
the
class
honest
men
is
this
is
the
form
but
it
may
also
be
expressed
in
any
one
of
the
following
forms
honest
men
exist
some
honest
men
exist
the
class
men
exists
there
are
honest
men
there
are
some
honest
men
similarly
the
proposition
no
existing
things
are
men
fifty
feet
high
asserts
that
the
class
men
feet
high
is
this
is
the
form
but
it
may
also
be
expressed
in
any
one
of
the
following
forms
men
feet
high
do
not
exist
no
men
feet
high
exist
the
class
feet

does
not

there
are

chapter
iii
of
a
of
of
the
kind
to
be
here
discussed
has
for
its
terms
two
specieses
of
the
same
genus
such
that
each
of
the
two
names
conveys
the
idea
of
some
attribute
conveyed
by
the
other
thus
the
proposition
some
merchants
are
misers
is
of
the
right
kind
since
merchants
and
misers
are
specieses
of
the
same
genus
men
and
since
the
name
merchants
conveys
the
idea
of
the
attribute
mercantile
and
the
name
misers
the
idea
of
the
attribute
miserly
each
of
which
ideas
is
conveyed
by
the
other
name
but
the
proposition
some
dogs
are
setters
is
of
the
right
kind
since
although
it
is
true
that
dogs
and
setters
are
specieses
of
the
same
genus
animals
it
is
true
that
the
name
dogs
conveys
the
idea
of
any
attribute
not
conveyed
by
the
name
setters
such
propositions
will
be
discussed
in
part
ii
the
genus
of
which
the
two
terms
are
specieses
is
called
the
of
or
more
briefly
the
the
sign
of
quantity
is
some
or
no
or
all
note
that
though
its
sign
of
quantity
tells
us
members
of
its
subject
are
members
of
its
predicate
it
does
not
tell
us
the
number
in
fact
it
only
deals
with
numbers
which
are
in
ascending
order
or
more
the
total
number
of
members
of
the
subject
it
is
called
a
proposition
of
relation
because
its
effect
is
to
assert
that
a
certain
exists
between
its
terms
of
a
proposition
of
relation
to
normal
the
rules
for
doing
this
are
as
follows
ascertain
what
is
the
ascertain
what
class
we
are
if
the
verb
governed
by
the
subject
is
the
verb
are
or
is
substitute
for
it
a
phrase
beginning
with
are
or
is
ascertain
what
is
the
ascertain
what
class
it
is
which
is
asserted
to
contain
or
or
of
the
members
of
the
subject
if
the
name
of
each
term
is
if
it
contains
a
substantive
there
is
no
need
to
determine
the
but
if
either
name
is
and
contains
only
it
is
then
necessary
to
determine
a
in
order
to
insert
its
name
as
the
substantive
ascertain
the
of

in
the
following
order
sign

let
us
work
a
few
examples
to
illustrate
these
rules
some

the

the

we

note
that
the
phrase
none
but
the
brave
is
equivalent
to
no
the
subject
has
for
its
but
no
is
supplied
so
we
express
the

we
substitute

that
in

the

first
at
first
sight
the

on
further
consideration
we
see
that
the

imply
that

the

proposition
of
relation
beginning
with
all
is
a
double
a
proposition
of
relation
beginning
with
all
asserts
as
we
already
know
that
members
of
the
subject
are
members
of
the
predicate
this
evidently
contains
as
a
of
what
it
tells
us
the
smaller
proposition
members
of
the
subject
are
members
of
the
predicate
thus
the
proposition
bankers
are
rich
men
evidently
contains
the
smaller
proposition
bankers
are
rich
men
the
question
now
arises
what
is
the
of
the
information
which
this
proposition
gives
us
in
order
to
answer
this
question
let
us
begin
with
the
smaller
proposition
members
of
the
subject
are
members
of
the
predicate
and
suppose
that
this
is
we
have
been
told
and
let
us
proceed
to
inquire
what
we
need
to
be
told
in
order
to
know
that
members
of
the
subject
are
members
of
the
predicate
thus
we
may
suppose
that
the
proposition
bankers
are
rich
men
is
all
the
information
we
possess
and
we
may
proceed
to
inquire
what
proposition
needs
to
be
added
to
it
in
order
to
make
up
the
entire
proposition
bankers
are
rich
men
let
us
also
suppose
that
the
the
genus
of
which
both
the
subject
and
the
predicate
are
specieses
has
been
divided
by
the
process
of
into
two
smaller
classes
viz
the
predicate
the
class
whose
differentia
is
to
that
of
the
predicate
thus
we
may
suppose
that
the
genus
men
of
which
both
bankers
and
rich
men
are
specieses
has
been
divided
into
the
two
smaller
classes
rich
men
poor
men
now
we
know
that
member
of
the
subject
is
as
shown
at
a
member
of
the
univ
hence
member
of
the
subject
is
either
in
class
or
else
in
class
thus
we
know
that
banker
is
a
member
of
the
genus
men
hence
banker
is
either
in
the
class
rich
men
or
else
in
the
class
poor
men
also
we
have
been
told
that
in
the
case
we
are
discussing
members
of
the
subject
are
in
class
what
do
we
need
to
be
told
in
order
to
know
that
of
them
are
there
evidently
we
need
to
be
told
that
of
them
are
in
class
that
of
them
are
members
of
the
class
whose
differentia
is
to
that
of
the
predicate
thus
we
may
suppose
we
have
been
told
that
bankers
are
in
the
class
rich
men
what
do
we
need
to
be
told
in
order
to
know
that
of
them
are
there
evidently
we
need
to
be
told
that
of
them
are
in
the
class
men
hence
a
proposition
of
relation
beginning
with
all
is
a
proposition
and
is
to
gives
the
same
information
as
the
propositions
members
of
the
subject
are
members
of
the
predicate
members
of
the
subject
are
members
of
the
class
whose
differentia
is
to
that
of
the
predicate
thus
the
proposition
bankers
are
rich
men
is
a
proposition
and
is
equivalent
to
the
propositions
bankers
are
rich
men
bankers
are
men
is
implied
in
a
proposition
of
relation
as
to
the
reality
of
its
terms
note
that
the
rules
here
laid
down
are
and
only
apply
to
part
i
of
my
symbolic
logic
a
proposition
of
relation
beginning
with
some
is
henceforward
to
be
understood
as
asserting
that
there
are
existing
which
being
members
of
the
subject
are
also
members
of
the
predicate
that
existing
are
members
of
terms
at
once
hence
it
is
to
be
understood
as
implying
that
term
taken
by
itself
is
thus
the
proposition
some
rich
men
are
invalids
is
to
be
understood
as
asserting
that
existing
are
rich
invalids
hence
it
implies
that
of
the
two
classes
rich
men
and
invalids
taken
by
itself
is
a
proposition
of
relation
beginning
with
no
is
henceforward
to
be
understood
as
asserting
that
there
are
existing
which
being
members
of
the
subject
are
also
members
of
the
predicate
that
existing
are
members
of
terms
at
once
but
this
implies
nothing
as
to
the
of
either
term
taken
by
itself
thus
the
proposition
no
mermaids
are
milliners
is
to
be
understood
as
asserting
that
existing
are
but
this
implies
nothing
as
to
the
or
the
of
either
of
the
two
classes
mermaids
and
milliners
taken
by
itself
in
this
case
as
it
happens
the
subject
is
and
the
predicate
a
proposition
of
relation
beginning
with
all
contains
see
a
similar
proposition
beginning
with
some
hence
it
is
to
be
understood
as
implying
that
term
taken
by
itself
is
thus
the
proposition
all
hyænas
are
savage
animals
contains
the
proposition
some
hyænas
are
savage
animals
hence
it
implies
that
of
the
two
classes
hyænas
and
savage
animals
taken
by
itself
is
of
a
proposition
of
relation
into
one
or
more
propositions
of
we
have
seen
that
a
proposition
of
relation
beginning
with
some
asserts
that
existing
being
members
of
its
subject
are
members
of
its
predicate
hence
it
asserts
that
some
existing
things
are
members
of
it
asserts
that
some
existing
things
are
members
of
the
class
of
things
which
have
the
attributes
of
the
subject
and
the
predicate
hence
to
translate
it
into
a
proposition
of
existence
we
take
existing
things
as
the
new
and
things
which
have
the
attributes
of
the
subject
and
the
predicate
as
the
new
predicate
similarly
for
a
proposition
of
relation
beginning
with
no
a
proposition
of
relation
beginning
with
all
is
as
shown
in
equivalent
to
propositions
one
beginning
with
some
and
the
other
with
no
each
of
which
we
now
know
how
to
translate
let
us
work
a
few
examples
to
illustrate
these
rules
some
apples
are
not
ripe
here
we
arrange
thus
some
of
existing
things
are
apples
or
thus
some
existing
things
are
apples
some
farmers
always
grumble
at
the
weather
whatever
it
may
be
here
we
arrange
thus
some
existing
things
are
farmers
who
always
grumble
at
the
weather
whatever
it
may
be
no
lambs
are
accustomed
to
smoke
cigars
here
we
arrange
thus
no
existing
things
lambs
accustomed
to
smoke
cigars
none
of
my
speculations
have
brought
me
as
much
as
per
cent
here
we
arrange
thus
no
existing
things
are
speculations
of
mine
which
have
brought
me
as
much
as
per
cent
none
but
the
brave
deserve
the
fair
here
we
note
to
begin
with
that
the
phrase
none
but
the
brave
is
equivalent
to
no
men
we
then
arrange
thus
no
existing
things
are
men
deserving
of
the
fair
all
bankers
are
rich
men
this
is
equivalent
to
the
two
propositions
some
bankers
are
rich
men
and
no
bankers
are
poor
men
here
we
arrange
thus
some
existing
things
are
rich
bankers
and
no
existing
things
are
poor

the

diagram
xy
xy
chapter
i
and
first
let
us
suppose
that
the
above
diagram
is
an
enclosure
assigned
to
a
certain
class
of
things
which
we
have
selected
as
our
of
discourse
or
more
briefly
as
our
for
example
we
might
say
let
univ
be
and
we
might
imagine
the
diagram
to
be
a
large
table
assigned
to
all
books
the
reader
is
strongly
advised
in
reading
this
chapter
to
refer
to
the
above
diagram
but
to
draw
a
large
one
for
himself
any
and
to
have
it
by
him
while
he
reads
and
keep
his
finger
on
that
particular
of
it
about
which
he
is
reading
secondly
let
us
suppose
that
we
have
selected
a
certain
adjunct
which
we
may
call
x
and
have
divided
the
large
class
to
which
we
have
assigned
the
whole
diagram
into
the
two
smaller
classes
whose
differentiæ
are
x
and
which
we
may
call
x
and
that
we
have
assigned
the
half
of
the
diagram
to
the
one
which
we
may
call
the
class
of
or
the
and
the
half
to
the
other
which
we
may
call
the
class
of
or
the
for
example
we
might
say
let
x
mean
so
that
x
will
mean
and
we
might
suppose
that
we
had
divided
books
into
the
two
classes
whose
differentiæ
are
old
and
new
and
had
assigned
the
half
of
the
table
to
books
and
the
half
to
books
thirdly
let
us
suppose
that
we
have
selected
another
adjunct
which
we
may
call
y
and
have
subdivided
the
into
the
two
classes
whose
differentiæ
are
y
and
y
and
that
we
have
assigned
the
cell
to
the
one
which
we
may
call
the
and
the
cell
to
the
other
which
we
may
call
the
for
example
we
might
say
let
y
mean
so
that
will
mean
and
we
might
suppose
that
we
had
subdivided
old
books
into
the
two
classes
whose
differentiæ
are
english
and
foreign
and
had
assigned
the
cell
to
old
books
and
the
cell
to
old
books
fourthly
let
us
suppose
that
we
have
subdivided
the
in
the
same
manner
and
have
assigned
the
cell
to
the
and
the
cell
to
the
for
example
we
might
suppose
that
we
had
subdivided
new
books
into
the
two
classes
new
books
and
new
books
and
had
assigned
the
cell
to
the
one
and
the
cell
to
the
other
it
is
evident
that
if
we
had
begun
by
dividing
for
y
and
y
and
had
then
subdivided
for
x
and
x
we
should
have
got
the
four
classes
hence
we
see
that
we
have
assigned
the
half
to
the
and
the
half
to
the
thus
in
the
above
example
we
should
find
that
we
had
assigned
the
half
of
the
table
to
books
and
the
half
to
books
old
old
english
foreign
books
books
new
new
english
foreign
books
books
we
have
in
fact
assigned
the
four
quarters
of
the
table
to
four
different
classes
of
books
as
here
shown
the
reader
should
carefully
remember
that
in
such
a
phrase
as
the
the
word
things
means
that
particular
of
things
to
which
the
whole
diagram
has
been
assigned
thus
if
we
say
let
univ
be
we
mean
that
we
have
assigned
the
whole
diagram
to
books
in
that
case
if
we
took
x
to
mean
old
the
phrase
the
would
mean
the
old
books
the
reader
should
not
go
on
to
the
next
chapter
until
he
is
with
the
diagram
i
have
advised
him
to
draw
he
ought
to
be
able
to
name
the
assigned
to
any
compartment
named
in
the
column
of
the
following
table
also
he
ought
to
be
able
to
name
the
assigned
to
any
adjunct
named
in
the
column
to
make
sure
of
this
he
had
better
put
the
book
into
the
hands
of
some
genial
friend
while
he
himself
has
nothing
but
the
blank
diagram
and
get
that
genial
friend
to
question
him
on
this
table
about
as
much
as
possible
the
questions
and
answers
should
be
something
like
this
table

after
a
little
practice
he
will
find
himself
able
to
do
without
the
blank
diagram
and
will
be
able
to
see
it
in
my
mind
eye
horatio
while
answering
the
questions
of
his
genial
friend
when
result
has
been
reached
he
may
safely
go
on
to
the
next
chapter
chapter
ii
let
us
agree
that
a
counter
placed
within
a
cell
shall
mean
this
cell
is
there
is
at
least
thing
in
it
let
us
also
agree
that
a
counter
placed
on
the
partition
between
two
cells
shall
mean
the
compartment
made
up
of
these
two
cells
is
but
it
is
not
known
in
it
its
occupants
are
hence
it
may
be
understood
to
mean
at
least
of
these
two
cells
is
occupied
possibly
are
our
ingenious
american
cousins
have
invented
a
phrase
to
describe
the
condition
of
a
man
who
has
not
yet
made
up
his
mind
of
two
political
parties
he
will
join
such
a
man
is
said
to
be
on
the
this
phrase
exactly
describes
the
condition
of
the
red
counter
let
us
also
agree
that
a
counter
placed
within
a
cell
shall
mean
this
cell
is
there
is
in
it
the
reader
had
better
provide
himself
with
red
counters
and
grey
ones

of
henceforwards
in
stating
such
propositions
as
some
exist
or
no
are
i
shall
omit
the
word
things
which
the
reader
can
supply
for
himself
and
shall
write
them
as
some
x
exist
or
no
x
are
y
note
that
the
word
things
is
here
used
with
a
special
meaning
as
explained
at
p
a
proposition
containing
only
of
the
letters
used
as
symbols
for
attributes
is
said
to
be
for
example
some
x
exist
no
y
exist
a
proposition
containing
letters
is
said
to
be
for
example
some
xy
exist
no
x
are
y
a
proposition
is
said
to
be
terms
the
letters
it
contains
whether
with
or
without
accents
thus
some
xy
exist
no
x
are
y
are
said
to
be
terms
x
and
y
of
propositions
of
let
us
take
first
the
proposition
some
x
exist
note
that
this
proposition
is
as
explained
at
equivalent
to
some
existing
things
are
this
tells
us
that
there
is
at
least
thing
in
the
north
half
that
is
that
the
north
half
is
and
this
we
can
evidently
represent
by
placing
a
counter
here
represented
by
a
circle
on
the
partition
which
divides
the
north
half
in
the
books
example
this
proposition
would
be
some
old
books
exist
similarly
we
may
represent
the
three
similar
propositions
some
exist
some
y
exist
and
some
y
exist
the
reader
should
make
out
all
these
for
himself
in
the
books
example
these
propositions
would
be
some
new
books
exist
let
us
take
next
the
proposition
no
x
exist
this
tells
us
that
there
is
in
the
north
half
that
is
that
the
north
half
is
that
is
that
the
cell
and
the
cell
are
both
of
them
and
this
we
can
represent
by
placing
counters
in
the
north
half
one
in
each
cell
the
reader
may
perhaps
think
that
it
would
be
enough
to
place
a
counter
on
the
partition
in
the
north
half
and
that
just
as
a
counter
so
placed
would
mean
this
half
is
so
a
one
would
mean
this
half
is
this
however
would
be
a
mistake
we
have
seen
that
a
counter
so
placed
would
mean
at
least
of
these
two
cells
is
occupied
possibly
are
hence
a
one
would
merely
mean
at
least
of
these
two
cells
is
empty
possibly
are
but
what
we
have
to
represent
is
that
both
cells
are
empty
and
this
can
only
be
done
by
placing
a
counter
in
of
them
in
the
books

this
proposition
would
be
no

these
three
propositions

us
take
next
the
proposition

tells
us
that
there
is
at

thing
in
the

be
represented
by
placing
counters
in
the
north
half

we
have
also
seen
that
these
two
counters
taken
represent
the
two
propositions
no
xy
exist

no

we
see
that
the
proposition

a
proposition

propositions

no

this
we
can
represent

that
the
of

proposition
by
supplying
the
substantive
animals
in

predicate
so
that
it
would
be
no

we
should
then
convert
it
by
interchanging
its
terms
so
that

we

with
the

is
supposed
to
be
set
before
us
with
certain
counters
placed
upon
it
and
the
problem
is
to
find
out
what
proposition
or
propositions
the
counters
represent
as
the
process
is
simply
the
reverse
of
that
discussed
in
the
previous
chapter
we
can
avail
ourselves
of
the
results
there
obtained
as
far
as
they
go
first
let
us
suppose
that
we
find
a
counter
placed
in
the

we
know
that
this
represents
each
of
the
trio
of
equivalent
propositions
some
xy

we

let
us
suppose
that
we
find
a
counter
placed
on
the
partition
which
divides
the
north
half
we
know
that
this
represents
the
proposition
some

similarly
we
may
interpret

let

suppose
that
we
find

in

we

that
this
represents

we

and
first
let
us
suppose
that
the
above
diagram
is
the
biliteral
diagram
that
we
have
been
using
in
book
and
that
we
change
it
into
a
diagram
by
drawing
an
so
as
to
divide
each
of
its
cells
into
portions
thus
making
cells
altogether
the
diagram
shows
the
result
the
reader
is
strongly
advised
in
reading
this
chapter
to
refer
to
the
above
diagrams
but
to
make
a
large
copy
of
the
one
for
himself
any
and
to
have
it
by
him
while
he
reads
and
keep
his
finger
on
that
particular
of
it
about
which
he
is
reading
secondly
let
us
suppose
that
we
have
selected
a
certain
adjunct
which
we
may
call
m
and
have
subdivided
the
into
the
two
classes
whose
differentiæ
are
m
and
m
and
that
we
have
assigned
the
cell
to
the
one
which
we
may
call
the
class
of
or
the
and
the
cell
to
the
other
which
we
may
call
the
class
of
or
the
thus
in
the
books
example
we
might
say
let
m
mean
so
that
m
will
mean
and
we
might
suppose
that
we
had
subdivided
the
class
old
english
books
into
the
two
classes
old
english
bound
books
and
old
english
unbound
books
and
had
assigned
the
cell
to
the
one
and
the
cell
to
the
other
thirdly
let
us
suppose
that
we
have
subdivided
the
the
and
the
in
the
same
manner
and
have
in
each
case
assigned
the
cell
to
the
class
possessing
the
attribute
m
and
the
cell
to
the
class
possessing
the
attribute
m
thus
in
the
books
example
we
might
suppose
that
we
had
subdivided
the
new
english
books
into
the
two
classes
new
english
bound
books
and
new
english
unbound
books
and
had
assigned
the
cell
to
the
one
and
the
cell
to
the
other
it
is
evident
that
we
have
now
assigned
the
to
the
and
the
to
the
thus
in
the
books
example
we
have
assigned
the
to
bound
books
and
the
to
unbound
books
when
the
reader
has
made
himself
familiar
with
this
diagram
he
ought
to
be
able
to
find
in
a
moment
the
compartment
assigned
to
a
particular
of
attributes
or
the
cell
assigned
to
a
particular
of
attributes
the
following
rules
will
help
him
in
doing
this
arrange
the
attributes
in
the
order
x
y
take
the
of
them
and
find
the
compartment
assigned
to
it
then
take
the
and
find
what
of
that
compartment
is
assigned
to
it
treat
the
if
there
is
one
in
the
same
way
for
example
suppose
we
have
to
find
the
compartment
assigned
to
ym
we
say
to
ourselves
y
has
the
half
and
m
has
the
portion
of
that
west
half
again
suppose
we
have
to
find
the
cell
assigned
to
we
say
to
ourselves
x
has
the
half
y
has
the
portion
of
that
south
half
has

the

of
propositions
in

of
x
and
m
or
of
y
and
of
propositions
of
existence
in
terms
of
x
and
m
or
of
y
and
let
us
take
first
the
proposition
some
xm
exist
note
that
the
meaning
of
this
proposition
is
as
explained
at
some
existing
things
are
this
tells
us
that
there
is
at
least
thing
in
the
inner
portion
of
the
north
half
that
is
that
this
compartment
is
and
this
we
can
evidently
represent
by
placing
a
counter
on
the
partition
which
divides
it
in
the
books
example
this
proposition
would
mean
some
old
bound
books
exist
or
there
are
some
old
bound
books
similarly
we
may
represent
the
seven
similar
propositions
some
exist
some
x
exist
some
x
exist
some
ym
exist
some
exist
some
y
exist
and
some
y
exist
let
us
take
next
the
proposition
no
xm
exist
this
tells
us
that
there
is
in
the
inner
portion
of
the
north
half
that
is
that
this
compartment
is
and
this
we
can
represent
by
placing
counters
in
it
one
in
each
cell
similarly
we
may
represent
the
seven
similar
propositions
in
terms
of
x
and
m
or
of
y
and
m
viz
no
xm
exist
no
x
exist
these
sixteen
propositions
of
existence
are
the
only
ones
that
we
shall
have
to
represent
on
this
diagram
of
propositions
of
relation
in
terms
of
x
and
m
or
of
y
and
let
us
take
first
the
pair
of
converse
propositions
some
x
are
m
some
m
are
x
we
know
that
each
of
these
is
equivalent
to
the
proposition
of
existence
some
xm
exist
which
we
already
know
how
to
represent
similarly
for
the
seven
similar
pairs
in
terms
of
x
and
m
or
of
y
and
let
us
take
next
the
pair
of
converse
propositions
no
x
are
m
no
m
are
x
we
know
that
each
of
these
is
equivalent
to
the
proposition
of
existence
no
xm
exist
which
we
already
know
how
to
represent
similarly
for
the
seven
similar
pairs
in
terms
of
x
and
m
or
of
y
and
let
us
take
next
the
proposition
all
x
are
we
know
see
that
this
is
a
proposition
and
equivalent
to
the
propositions
some
x
are
m
and
no
x
are
m
each
of
which
we
already
know
how
to
represent
similarly
for
the
fifteen
similar
propositions
in
terms
of
x
and
m
or
of
y
and
these
propositions
of
relation
are
the
only
ones
that
we
shall
have
to
represent
on
this
diagram
the
reader
should
now
get
his
genial

to

him
on
the
following
four

the

should
have
nothing

of
two
propositions
of
relation
one
in
terms
of
x
and
m
and
the
other
in
terms
of
y
and
m
on
the
same
the
reader
had
better
now
begin
to
draw
little
diagrams
for
himself
and
to
mark
them
with
the
digits
i
and
o
instead
of
using
the
board
and
counters
he
may
put
a
i
to
represent
a
counter
this
may
be
interpreted
to
mean
there
is
at
least
thing
here
and
a
o
to
represent
a
counter
this
may
be
interpreted
to
mean
there
is
here
the
pair
of
propositions
that
we
shall
have
to
represent
will
always
be
one
in
terms
of
x
and
m
and
the
other
in
terms
of
y
and
when
we
have
to
represent
a
proposition
beginning
with
all
we
break
it
up
into
the
propositions
to
which
it
is
equivalent
when
we
have
to
represent
on
the
same
diagram
propositions
of
which
some
begin
with
some
and
others
with
no
we
represent
the
ones
this
will
sometimes
save
us
from
having
to
put
a
i
on
a
fence
and
afterwards
having
to
shift
it
into
a
cell
let
us
work
a
few
examples
no
x
are
m
no
y
are
m
let
us
first
represent
no
x
are
m
this
gives
us
diagram
a
then
representing
no
y
are
m
on
the
same
diagram
we
get
diagram
a
b
o
o
o
o
o
o
some
m
are
x
no
m
are
y
if
neglecting
the
rule
we
were
begin
with
some
m
are
x
we
should
get
diagram
a
and
if
we
were
then
to
take
no
m
are
y
which
tells
us
that
the
inner
cell
is
we
should
be
obliged
to
take
the
i
off
the
fence
as
it
no
longer
has
the
choice
of
cells
and
to
put
it
into
the
inner
cell
as
in
diagram
this
trouble
may
be

examine

way
with

we
do

whether
the

so
we
can
not

in

we
find

we
mark

so
on
the
biliteral

in
the

we
have
no

in

we
have
not

we

we

we

we

when
a
trio
of
biliteral
propositions
of
relation
is
such
that
all
their
six
terms
are
species
of
the
same
genus
every
two
of
them
contain
between
them
a
pair
of
codivisional
classes
the
three
propositions
are
so
related
that
if
the
first
two
were
true
the
third
would
be
true
the
trio
is
called
a
the
genus
of
which
each
of
the
six
terms
is
a
species
is
called
its
of
or
more
briefly
its
the
first
two
propositions
are
called
its
and
the
third
its
also
the
pair
of
codivisional
terms
in
the
premisses
are
called
its
and
the
other
two
its
the
conclusion
of
a
syllogism
is
said
to
be
from
its
premisses
hence
it
is
usual
to
prefix
to
it
the
word
therefore
or
the
symbol
note
that
the
are
so
called
because
they
are
and
do
not
appear
in
the
conclusion
and
that
the
are
so
called
because
they
are
and
appear
in
the
conclusion
note
also
that
the
question
whether
the
conclusion
is
or
is
not
from
the
premisses
is
not
affected
by
the
truth
or
falsity
of
any
of
the
trio
but
depends
entirely
on
their
to
each
as
a
let
us
take
the
trio
no
are
no
are
no
are
which
we
may
write
as
explained
at
thus
no
x
are
m
no
y
are
m
no
x
are
y
here
the
first
and
second
contain
the
pair
of
codivisional
classes
m
and
m
the
first
and
third
contain
the
pair
x

x
and
the
second

third
contain
the
pair
y
and
y
also
the
three
propositions
are
as
we
shall
see
hereafter
so
related
that
if
the
first
two
were
true
the
third
would
also
be
true
hence
the
trio
is
a
the
two
propositions
no
x
are
m
and
no
y
are
m
are
its
the
proposition
no
x
are
y
is
its
the
terms
m
and
m
are
its
and
the
terms
x
and

are

hence
we
may
write
it
thus
no

no

take
the
trio

put

are
all

some

some
chickens
are

understanding

here
all
the
six
terms
are
species
of

also
the
first

propositions
contain
the
pair
of
codivisional

cats
and

the
first
and
third
contain
the
pair
creatures
understanding
french
and
creatures
understanding
french
and
the
second
and
third
contain
the
pair
chickens
and
chickens
also
the
three
propositions
are
as
we
shall
see
at
so
related
that
if
the
first
two
were
true
the
third
would
be
true
the
first
two
are
as
it
happens
strictly
true
in
planet
but
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
them
from
being
true
in
some
planet
say
or
in
which
case
the
third
would
be
true
in
that
planet
and
its
inhabitants
would
probably
engage
chickens
as
they
would
thus
secure
a
singular
privilege
unknown
in
england
namely
that
they
would
be
able
at
any
time
when
provisions
ran
short
to
utilise
the
for
the
hence
the
trio
is
a
the
genus
creatures
is
its
the
two
propositions
all
cats
understand
french
and
some
chickens
are
cats
are
its
the
proposition
some
chickens
understand
french
is
its
the
terms
cats
and
cats
are
its
and
the
terms
creatures
understanding
french
and
chickens
are
its
hence
we
may
write
it
thus
all

chapter

in
when
the
terms
of
a
proposition
are
represented
by
it
is
said
to
be
when
by
to
translate
a
proposition
from
concrete
into
abstract
form
we
fix
on
a
and
regard
each
term
as
a
of
it
and
we
choose
a
letter
to
represent
its
for
example
suppose
we
wish
to
translate
some
soldiers
are
brave
into
abstract
form
we
may
take
men
as
and
regard
soldiers
and
brave
men
as
of
the
men
and
we
may
choose
x
to
represent
the
peculiar
attribute
say
military
of
soldiers
and
y
to
represent
brave
then
the
proposition
may
be
written
some
military
men
are
brave
men
some
are
omitting
men
as
explained
at
some
x
are
y
in
practice
we
should
merely
say
let
univ
be
men
x
soldiers
y
brave
and
at
once
translate
some
soldiers
are
brave
into
some
x
are
y
the
problems
we
shall
have
to
solve
are
of
two
kinds
viz
given
a
pair
of
propositions
of
relation
which
contain
between
them
a
pair
of
codivisional
classes
and
which
are
proposed
as
premisses
to
ascertain
what
conclusion
if
any
is
consequent
from
them
given
a
trio
of
propositions
of
relation
of
which
every
two
contain
a
pair
of
codivisional
classes
and
which
are
proposed
as
a
syllogism
to
ascertain
whether
the
proposed
conclusion
is
consequent
from
the
proposed
premisses
and
if
so
whether
it
is
these
problems
we
will
discuss
separately
a
pair
of
propositions
of
relation
which
contain
between
them
a
pair
of
codivisional
classes
and
which
are
proposed
as
premisses
to
ascertain
what
conclusion
if
any
is
consequent
from
the
rules
for
doing
this
are
as
follows
determine
the
of
discourse
construct
a
dictionary
making
m
and
m
or
m
and
m
represent
the
pair
of
codivisional
classes
and
x
or
x
and
y
or
y
the
other
two
translate
the
proposed
premisses
into
abstract
form
represent
them
together
on
a
triliteral
diagram
ascertain
what
proposition
if
any
in
terms
of
x
and
y
is
represented
on
it
translate
this
into
concrete
form
it
is
evident
that
if
the
proposed
premisses
were
true
this
other
proposition
would
be
true
hence
it
is
a
consequent
from
the
proposed
premisses
let
us
work
some
examples
no
son
of
mine
is
dishonest
people
always
treat
an
honest
man
with
respect
taking
men
as
we
may
write
these
as
follows
no
sons
of
mine
are
dishonest
men
all
honest
men
are
men
treated
with
respect
we
can
now
construct
our
dictionary
viz
m
honest
x
sons
of
mine
y
treated
with
respect
note
that
the
expression
x
sons
of
mine
is
an
abbreviated
form
of
x
the
differentia
of
of
mine
when
regarded
as
a
species
of
the
next
thing
is
to
translate
the
proposed
premisses
into
abstract
form
as
follows
no
x
are
m
all
m
are
y
next
by
the
process
described
at
we
represent
these
on
a
triliteral
diagram
thus
o
o
o

next
by
the
process
described
at
we
transfer
to
a

all
the
information
we
can
o
the
result
we
read
as
no
x
are

or
as
no
y
are

whichever
we
prefer
so
we
refer
to
our
dictionary
to
see
which
will
look
best
and
we
choose
no
x

which
translated
into

be

all

we
write

we
can
now
construct

in
order
to
represent
these
on

we
break
up
the
first

the
two
propositions
to
which
it
is
equivalent

thus
get
the
propositions
some

some

the
rule
given
at
would
make
us
take
these
in
the
order
this
however
would
produce
the
result

so
it
would
be
better
to
take
them

give
us

ii
of
propositions
of
let
us
take
first
the
proposition
some
x
are
y
this
we
know
is
equivalent
to
the
proposition
of
existence
some
xy
exist
see
p
hence
it
may
be
represented
by
the
expression
the
converse
proposition
some
y
are
x
may
of
course
be
represented
by
the
expression
viz
similarly
we
may
represent
the
three
similar
pairs
of
converse
propositions
some
x
are
y
some
y
are
x
some
x
are
y
some
y
are
x
some
x
are
y
some
y
are
x
let
us
take
next
the
proposition
no
x
are
y
this
we
know
is
equivalent
to
the
proposition
of
existence
no
xy
exist
see
p
hence
it
may
be
represented
by
the
expression
the
converse
proposition
no
y
are
x
may
of
course
be
represented
by
the
expression
viz
similarly
we
may
represent
the
three
similar
pairs
of

no

no

y
are
x
no
x
are
y
no
y
are
x
let
us
take
next
the
proposition
all
x
are
y
now
it
is
evident
that
the
double
proposition
of
existence
some
x
exist
and
no
xy
exist
tells
us
that
exist
but
that
of
them
have
the
attribute
y
that
is
it
tells
us
that
of
them
have
the
attribute
y
that
is
it
tells
us
that
all
x
are
y
also
it
is
evident
that
the
expression
represents
this
double
proposition
hence
it
also
represents
the
proposition
all
x
are
y
the
reader
will
perhaps
be
puzzled
by
the
statement
that
the
proposition
all
x
are
y
is
equivalent
to
the
double
proposition
some
x
exist
and
no
xy
exist
remembering
that
it
was
stated
at
to
be
equivalent
to
the
double
proposition
some
x
are
y
and
no
x
are
y
some
xy
exist
and
no
exist
the
explanation
is
that
the
proposition
some
xy
exist
contains
some
x
exist
is
enough
for
our
purpose
this
expression
may
be
written
in
a
shorter
form
viz
since
subscript
takes
effect
back
to
the
of
the
expression
similarly
we
may
represent
the
seven
similar
propositions
all
x
are
y
all
x
are
y
all
x
are
y
all
y
are
x
all
y
are
x
all
y
are
x
and
all
y
are
x
the
reader
should
make
out
all
these
for
himself
it
will
be
convenient
to
remember
that
in
translating
a
proposition
beginning
with
all
from
abstract
form
into
subscript
form
or
the
predicate
that
is
changes
from
positive
to
negative
or
else
from
negative
to
positive
thus
the
proposition
all
y
are
x
becomes
where
the
predicate
changes
from
x
to
x
again
the
expression
becomes
all
x
are
y
where
the
predicate
changes
for
y
to
y
chapter
iii
of
we
already
know
how
to
represent
each
of
the
three
propositions
of
a
syllogism
in
subscript
form
when
that
is
done
all
we
need
besides
is
to
write
the
three
expressions
in
a
row
with
between
the
premisses
and
before
the
conclusion
thus
the
syllogism
no
x
are
m
all
m
are
y
no
x
are
y
may
be
represented
thus
when
a
proposition
has
to
be
translated
from
concrete
form
into
subscript
form
the
reader
will
find
it
convenient
just
at
first
to
translate
it
into
form
and
into
subscript
form
but
after
a
little
practice
he
will
find
it
quite
easy
to
go
straight
from
concrete
form
to
subscript
form
for
solving
problems
in
when
once
we
have
found
by
diagrams
the
conclusion
to
a
given
pair
of
premisses
and
have
represented
the
syllogism
in
subscript
form
we
have
a
by
which
we
can
at
once
find
without
having
to
use
diagrams
again
the
conclusion
to
any
pair
of
premisses
having
the
subscript
forms
thus
the
expression
is
a
formula
by
which
we
can
find
the
conclusion
to
any
pair
of
premisses
whose
subscript
forms
are
for
example
suppose
we
had
the
pair
of
propositions
no
gluttons
are
healthy
no
unhealthy
men
are
strong
proposed
as
premisses
taking
men
as
our
and
making
m
healthy
x
gluttons
y
strong
we
might
translate
the
pair
into
abstract
form
thus
no
x
are
m
no
m
are
y
these
in
subscript
form
would
be
which
are
identical
with
those
in
our
hence
we
at
once
know
the
conclusion
to
be
that
is
in
abstract
form
no
x
are
y
that
is
in
concrete
form
no
gluttons
are
strong
i
shall
now
take
three
different
forms
of
pairs
of
premisses
and
work
out
their
conclusions
once
for
all
by
diagrams
and
thus
obtain
some
useful
formulæ
i
shall
call
them
fig
i
fig
ii
and
fig
iii
fig
i
this
includes
any
pair
of
premisses
which
are
both
of
them
nullities
and
which
contain
unlike
eliminands
the
simplest
case
is
o
o
o
o
o
in
this
case
we
see
that
the
conclusion
is
a
nullity
and
that
the
retinends
have
kept
their
signs
and
we
should
find
this
rule
to
hold
good
with
pair
of
premisses
which
fulfil
the
given
conditions
the
reader
had
better
satisfy
himself
of
this
by
working
out
on
diagrams
several
varieties
such
as
which
which
which
which
if
either
retinend
is
asserted
in
the
to
exist

course
it
may
be
so
asserted

we
get
two

is
so
asserted

reader
had
better
work
out

of
these
two
variants
such
as
which

proves
the
formula
to
be
remembered
is
with
the

two
rules

this

any

of
which

is

the
simplest
case
is
note
that
is
here
stated
because
it
does
not
matter
in
which
of
the
two
premisses
it
occurs
so
that
this
includes
the
forms
and
o

in

any

us
by

prove
may
be
called
a
derived
from
the
latin
verb
i
deceive
but
the
particular
kind
to
be
now
discussed
consists
of
a
pair
of
propositions
which
are
proposed
as
the
premisses
of
a
syllogism
but
yield
no
conclusion
when
each
of
the
proposed
premisses
is
a
proposition
in
or
or
the
only
kinds
with
which
we
are
now
concerned
the
fallacy
may
be
detected
by
the
of
diagrams
by
simply
setting
them
out
on
a
triliteral
diagram
and
observing
that
they
yield
no
information
which
can
be
transferred
to
the
biliteral
diagram
but
suppose
we
were
working
by
the
of
and
had
to
deal
with
a
pair
of
proposed
premisses
which
happened
to
be
a
how
could
we
be
certain
that
they
would
not
yield
any
conclusion
our
best
plan
is
i
think
to
deal
with
in
the
same
was
as
we
have
already
dealt
with
that
is
to
take
certain
forms
of
pairs
of
propositions
and
to
work
them
out
once
for
all
on
the
triliteral
diagram
and
ascertain
that
they
yield
conclusion
and
then
to
record
them
for
future
use
as
for
just
as
we
have
already
recorded
our
three
for
now
if
we
were
to
record
the
two
sets
of
formulæ
in
the
shape
viz
by
the
method
of
subscripts
there
would
be
considerable
risk
of
confusing
the
two
kinds
hence
in
order
to
keep
them
distinct
i
propose
to
record
the
formulæ
for
in
and
to
call
them
forms
instead
of
formulæ
let
us
now
proceed
to
find
by
the
method
of
diagrams
three
forms
of
fallacies
which
we
will
then
put
on
record
for
future
use
they
are
as
follows
fallacy
of
like
eliminands
not
asserted
to
exist
fallacy
of
unlike
eliminands
with
an
fallacy
of
two
these
shall
be
discussed
separately
and
it
will
be
seen
that
each
fails
to
yield
a
conclusion
of
like
eliminands
not
asserted
to
it
is
evident
that
neither
of
the
given
propositions
can
be
an
since
that
kind
asserts
the
of
both
of
its
terms
see
hence
they
must
both
be

the

us
suppose
that
we
have
before
us
a
pair
of
propositions
of
relation
which
contain
between
them
a
pair
of
codivisional
classes
and
that
we
wish
to
ascertain
what
conclusion
if
any
is
consequent
from
them
we
translate
them
if
necessary
into
and
then
proceed
as
follows
we
examine
their
subscripts
in
order
to
see
whether
they
are
a
a

of
nullities
or
b
a
nullity
and
an
entity
or
c
a
pair
of

if
they
are
a

of
nullities
we
examine
their
eliminands
in
order
to
see
whether
they
are
unlike
or
like
if
their
eliminands
are
it
is
a
case
of

we
then
examine
their
retinends
to
see
whether
one
or
both
of

are
asserted

asserted

so
it
is
a
case

if
not
it
is
a
case
of
fallacy
of

not

examine

when
a
set
of
three
or
more
biliteral
propositions
are
such
that
all
their
terms
are
species
of
the
same
genus
and
are
also
so
related
that
two
of
them
taken
together
yield
a
conclusion
which
taken
with
another
of
them
yields
another
conclusion
and
so
on
until
all
have
been
taken
it
is
evident
that
if
the
original
set
were
true
the
last
conclusion
would
be
true
such
a
set
with
the
last
conclusion
tacked
on
is
called

briefly

therefore
appear

conclusion
contains
one

that
the
conclusion
contains

said
to
be
from

reason
it
is
usual
to
prefix
to
it

or

symbol
note
that
the
question
whether
the
conclusion
is
or
is
not
from
the
premisses
is
not
affected
by
the
truth
or
falsity
of
any
one
of
the
propositions
which
make
up
the
sorites
by
depends
entirely
on
their
to

as

let
us
take
the
following
set
of
propositions
no

all

are

all

no

all

here
the
first

taken
together
yield
no

this
taken
along
with
the
third
yields
no
a
are
d
this
taken
along
with
the
fourth
yields
no
d
are
e
and
this
taken
along
with
the
fifth
yields
all

are

hence
if
the
original
set
were
true
this
would
be
true
hence
the
original
set
with
this
tacked
on
is
a
the
original
set
is
its
the
proposition
all
h
are
d
is
its
the
terms
a
b
c

are

and
the
terms

hence
we
may
write
the

no

no

no

are

but
if
the
premisses
were

in

other

might
be
obtained
thus
the

yields

in
the
problems
we
shall
have
to
solve
are
of
the
following
form
given
three
or
more
propositions
of
relation
which
are
proposed
as
premisses
to
ascertain
what
conclusion
if
any
is
consequent
from
them
we
will
limit
ourselves
at
present
to
problems
which
can
be
worked
by
the
formulæ
of
fig
i
see
p
those
that
require
formulæ
are
rather
too
hard
for
beginners
such
problems
may
be
solved
by
either
of
two
methods
viz
the
method
of
separate
syllogisms
the
method
of
underscoring
these
shall
be
discussed
separately
by
method
of
separate
the
rules
for
doing
this
are
as
follows
name
the
of
discourse
construct
a
dictionary
making
a
b
c
represent
the
terms
put
the
proposed
premisses
into
subscript
form
select
two
which
containing
between
them
a
pair
of
codivisional
classes
can
be
used
as
the
premisses
of
a
syllogism
find
their
conclusion
by
formula
find
a
third
premiss
which
along
with
this
conclusion
can
be
used
as
the
premisses
of
a
second
syllogism
find
a
second
conclusion
by
formula
proceed
thus
until
all
the
proposed
premisses
have
been
used
put
the
last
conclusion
which
is
the
complete
conclusion
of
the
sorites
into
concrete
form
as
an
example
of
this
process
let
us
take
as
the
proposed
set
of
premisses
all
the
policemen
on
this
beat
sup
with
our
cook
no
man
with
long
hair
can
fail
to
be
a
poet
amos
judd
has
never
been
in
prison
our
cook
all
love
cold
mutton
none
but
policemen
on
this
beat
are
poets
none
but
her
ever
sup
with
our
cook
men
with
short
hair
have
all
been
in
prison
univ
men
a
amos
judd
b
cousins
of
our
cook
c
having
been
in
prison
d
e
loving
cold
mutton
h
poets
k
policemen
on
this
beat
l
supping
with
our
cook
we
now
have
to
put
the
proposed
premisses
into
form
let
us
begin
by
putting
them
into
form
the
result
is
all
k
are
l
no
d
are
h
all
a
are
c
all
b
are
e
no
k
are
h
no
b
are
l
all
d
are
and
it
is
now
easy
to
put
them
into
form
as
follows
we
now
have
to
find
a
pair
of
premisses
which
will
yield
a
conclusion
let
us
begin
with
no
and
look
down
the
list
till
we
come
to
one
which
we
can
take
along
with
it
so
as
to
form
premisses
belonging
to
fig
i
we
find
that
no
will
do
since
we
can
take
k
as
our
eliminand
so
our
first
syllogism
is
we
must
now
begin
again
with
and
find
a
premiss
to
go
along
with
it
we
find
that
no
will
do
h
being
our
eliminand
so
our
next
syllogism
is
we
have
now
used
up
nos
and
and
must
search
among
the
others
for
a
partner
for
we
find
that
no
will
do
so
we
write
now
what
can
we
take
along
with
no
will
do
along
with
this
we
may
take
no
and
along
with
this
we
may
take
no
this
complete
conclusion
translated
into
form
is
all
a
are
e
and
this
translated
into
form
is
amos
judd
loves
cold
mutton
in
actually
this
problem
the
above
explanations
would
of
course
be
omitted
and
all
that
would
appear
on
paper
would
be
as
follows
note
that
in
working
a
sorites
by
this
process
we
may
begin
with
premiss
we
choose
by
method
of
consider
the
pair
of
premisses
which
yield
the
conclusion
we
see
that
in
order
to
get
this
conclusion
we
must
eliminate
m
and
m
and
write
x
and
y
together
in
one
expression
now
if
we
agree
to
m
and
m
as
eliminated
and
to
read
the
two
expressions
together
as
if
they
were
written
in
one
the
two
premisses
will
then
exactly
represent
the
and
we
need
not
write
it
out
separately
let
us
agree
to
mark
the
eliminated
letters
by
them
putting
a
score
under
the
and
a
one
under
the
the
two
premisses
now
become
which
we
read
as
in
copying
out
the
premisses
for
underscoring
it
will
be
convenient
to
all
as
to
the
we
may
always
them
written
and
as
to
the
we
are
not
concerned
to
know
terms
are
asserted
to
except
those
which
appear
in
the
conclusion
and
for
it
will
be
easy
enough
to
refer
to
the
original
list
i
will
now
go
through
the
process
of
solving
by
this
method
the
example
worked
in
the
data
are
the
reader
should
take
a
piece
of
paper
and
write
out
this
solution
for
himself
the
first
line
will
consist
of
the
above
data
the
second
must
be
composed
bit
by
bit
according
to
the
following
directions
we
begin
by
writing
down
the
first
premiss
with
its
numeral
over
it
but
omitting
the
subscripts
we
have
now
to
find
a
premiss
which
can
be
combined
with
this
a
premiss
containing
either
k
or
the
first
we
find
is
no
and
this
we
tack
on
with
a
to
get
the
from
these
k
and
k
must
be
eliminated
and
what
remains
must
be
taken
as
one
expression
so
we
them
putting
a
score
under
k
and
a
one
under
k
the
result
we
read
as
we
must
now
find
a
premiss
containing
either
l
or
h
looking
along
the
row
we
fix
on
no
and
tack
it
on
now
these
nullities
are
really
equivalent
to
dh
in
which
h
and
h
must
be
eliminated
and
what
remains
taken
as
one
expression
so
we
them
the
result
reads
as
l
we
now
want
a
premiss
containing
l
or
d
no
will
do
these
nullities
are
really
equivalent
to
l
so
we
underscore
l
and
the
result
reads
as
db
we
now
want
a
premiss
containing
d
or
b
no
will
do
here
we
underscore
b
and
b
the
result
reads
as
de
we
now
want
a
premiss
containing
d
or
no
will
do
here
we
underscore
d
and
d
the
result
reads
as
we
now
want
a
premiss
containing
c
or
no
will
do
in
fact
do
as
it
is
the
only
one
left
here
we
underscore
c
and
c
and
as
the
whole
thing
now
reads
as
we
tack
on
as
the
with
a
we
now
look
along
the
row
of
data
to
see
whether
e
or
a
has
been
given
as
we
find
that
a
has
been
so
given
in
no
so
we
add
this
fact
to
the
conclusion
which
now
stands
as
all
a
are
if
the
reader
has
faithfully
obeyed
the
above
directions
his
written
solution
will
now
stand
as
follows
kl
dh
be
ac
all
a
are
the
reader
should
now
take
a
second
piece
of
paper
and
copy
the
data
only
and
try
to
work
out
the
solution
for
himself
beginning
with
some
other
premiss
if
he
fails
to
bring
out
the
conclusion
i
would
advise
him
to
take
a
third
piece
of
paper
and
i
will
now
work
out
in
its
briefest
form

sorites
of
premisses

notes
a
see
one
of
the
favourite
objections
brought
against
the
science
of
logic
by
its
detractors
is
that
a
syllogism
has
no
real
validity
as
an
argument
since
it
involves
the
fallacy
of
begging
the
question
the
essence
of
which
is
that
the
whole
conclusion
is
involved
in
of
the
premisses
this
formidable
objection
is
refuted
with
beautiful
clearness
and
simplicity
by
these
three
diagrams
which
show
us
that
in
each
of
the
three
figures
the
conclusion
is
really
involved
in
the
premisses
taken
together
each
contributing
its
share
thus
in
fig
the
premiss
empties
the
cell
of
the
quarter
while
the
premiss
empties
its
cell
hence
it
needs
the
premisses
to
empty
the
of
the
quarter
and
thus
to
prove
the
conclusion
again
in
fig
the
premiss
empties
the
inner
cell
of
the
quarter
the
premiss
merely
tells
us
that
the
inner
portion
of
the
half
is
so
that
we
may
place
a
in
it
but
if
this
were
the
of
our
information
we
should
not
know
in
cell
to
place
it
so
that
it
would
have
to
on
the
fence
it
is
only
when
we
learn
from
the
other
premiss
that
the
of
these
two
cells
is
that
we
feel
authorised
to
place
the
in
the
cell
and
thus
to
prove
the
conclusion
lastly
in
fig
the
information
that
m
merely
authorises
us
to
place
a
in
the
inner
square
but
it
has
large
choice
of
fences
to
sit
upon
it
needs
the
premiss
to
drive
it
out
of
the
half
of
that
square
and
it
needs
the
premiss
to
drive
it
out
of
the
half
hence
it
needs
the
premisses
to
drive
it
into
the
inner
portion
of
the
quarter
and
thus
to
prove
the
conclusion

of

writers

which
run
in

grooves
to
whom
i
shall
hereafter
refer
by
the
i
hope
inoffensive
title
the
logicians
take
on
this
subject
what
seems
to
me
to
be
a
more
humble
position
than
is
at
all
necessary
they
speak
of
the
copula
of
a
proposition
with
bated
breath
almost
as
if
it
were
a
living
conscious
entity
capable
of
declaring
for
itself
what
it
chose
to
mean
and
that
we
poor
human
creatures
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
ascertain
was
its
sovereign
will
and
pleasure
and
submit
to
it
in
opposition
to
this
view
i
maintain
that
any
writer
of
a
book
is
fully
authorised
in
attaching
any
meaning
he
likes
to
any
word
or
phrase
he
intends
to
use
if
i
find
an
author
saying
at
the
beginning
of
his
book
let
it
be
understood
that
by
the
word
i
shall
always
mean
and
that
by
the
word
i
shall
always
mean
i
meekly
accept
his
ruling
however
injudicious
i
may
think
it
and
so
with
regard
to
the
question
whether
a
proposition
is
or
is
not
to
be
understood
as
asserting
the
existence
of
its
subject
i
maintain
that
every
writer
may
adopt
his
own
rule
provided
of
course
that
it
is
consistent
with
itself
and
with
the
accepted
facts
of
logic
let
us
consider
certain
views
that
may
be
held
and
thus
settle
which
of
them
may
be
held
after
which
i
shall
hold
myself
free
to
declare
which
of
them
intend
to
hold
the
of
propositions
to
be
considered
are
those
that
begin
with
some
with
no
and
with
all
these
are
usually
called
propositions
in
in
and
in
first
then
a
proposition
in
may
be
understood
as
asserting
or
else
as
asserting
the
existence
of
its
subject
by
existence
i
mean
of
course
whatever
kind
of
existence
suits
its
nature
the
two
propositions
exist
and
exist
denote
two
totally
different
kinds
of
existence
a
is
an
aggregate
of
ideas
and
exists
only
in
the
of
a
whereas
a
is
an
aggregate
of
wood
and
parchment
and
exists
in
hands
of
a
first
let
us
suppose
that
asserts
asserts
the
existence
of
its
subject
here
of
course
we
must
regard
a
proposition
in
as
making
the
assertion
since
it
necessarily
a
proposition
in
we
now
have
and
asserting
does
this
leave
us
free
to
make
what
supposition
we
choose
as
to
my
answer
is
no
we
are
tied
down
to
the
supposition
that
does
assert
this
can
be
proved
as
follows
if
possible
let
assert
then
taking
x
y
and
z
to
represent
attributes
we
see
that
if
the
proposition
no
xy
are
z
be
true
some
things
exist
with
the
attributes
x
and
y
some
x
are
y
also
we
know
that
if
the
proposition
some
xy
are
z
be
true
the
same
result
follows
but
these
two
propositions
are
contradictories
so
that
one
or
other
of
them
be
true
hence
this
result
is
true
the
proposition
some
x
are
y
is
true
est
see
note
a
we
see
then
that
the
supposition
asserts
necessarily
leads
to
asserts
but
does
not
and
this
is
the
of
the
various
views
that
may
conceivably
be
held
next
let
us
suppose
that
does
assert
and
along
with
this
let
us
take
the
supposition
that
assert
hence
the
proposition
no
x
are
y
means
some
x
exist
and
none
of
them
are
y
of
them
are
which
is
a
proposition
in
we
also
know
of
course
that
the
proposition
all
x
are
proves
no
x
are
y
now
two
propositions
each
of
which
proves
the
other
are
hence
every
proposition
in
is
equivalent
to
one
in
and
therefore
hence
our
conceivable
view
is
and
assert
but
does
not
this
view
does
not
seen
to
involve
any
necessary
contradiction
with
itself
or
with
the
accepted
facts
of
logic
but
when
we
come
to
it
as
applied
to
the
actual
of
life
we
shall
find
i
think
that
it
fits
in
with
them
so
badly
that
its
adoption
would
be
to
say
the
least
of
it
singularly
inconvenient
for
ordinary
folk
let
me
record
a
little
dialogue
i
have
just
held
with
my
friend
jones
who
is
trying
to
form
a
new
club
to
be
regulated
on
strictly
principles
well
jones
have
you
got
your
new
club
started
yet
his
you
be
glad
to
hear
that
some
of
the
members
mind
i
only
say
are
millionaires
rolling
in
gold
my
boy
that
sounds
well
and
how
many
members
have
entered
none
at
all
we
have
got
it
started
yet
what
makes
you
think
we
have
why
i
thought
you
said
that
some
of
the
members
you
do
seem
to
be
aware
that
working
on
strictly
principles
a
proposition
does
assert
the
existence
of
its
subject
i
merely
meant
to
say
that
we
made
a
rule
not
to
admit
members
till
we
have
at
least
candidates
whose
incomes
are
over
ten
thousand
a
year
oh
what
you
meant
is
it
let
hear
some
more
of
your
rules
another
is
that
no
one
who
has
been
convicted
seven
times
of
forgery
is
admissible
and
here
again
i
suppose
you
do
mean
to
assert
there
any
such
convicts
in
existence
why
that
exactly
what
i
mean
to
assert
do
you
know
that
a
universal
negative
the
existence
of
its
subject
we
did
make
that
rule
till
we
had
satisfied
ourselves
that
there
are
several
such
convicts
now
living
the
reader
can
now
decide
for
himself
how
far
this
conceivable
view
would
fit
in
with
the
facts
of
life
he
will
i
think
agree
with
me
that
jones
view
of
the
import
of
propositions
would
lead
to
some
inconvenience
thirdly
let
us
suppose
that
neither
nor
asserts
now
the
supposition
that
the
two
propositions
some
x
are
y
and
no
x
are
do
assert
necessarily
involves
the
supposition
that
all
x
are
y
does
assert
since
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
they
assert
when
combined
more
than
they
do
when
taken
separately
hence
the
and
last
of
the
conceivable
views
is
that
neither
nor
nor
asserts
the
advocates
of
this
third
view
would
interpret
the
proposition
some
x
are
y
to
mean
if
there
any
x
in
existence
some
of
them
be
y
and
so
with
and
it
admits
of
proof
that
this
view
as
regards
conflicts
with
the
accepted
facts
of
logic
let
us
take
the
syllogism
which
is
universally
accepted
as
valid
its
form
is
all
m
are
x
all
m
are
y
some
y
are
x
this
they
would
interpret
as
follows
if
there
were
any
m
in
existence
all
of
them
would
be
x
if
there
were
any
m
in
existence
all
of
them
would
be
y
if
there
were
any
y
in
existence
some
of
them
would
be
x
that
this
conclusion
does
follow
has
been
so
briefly
and
clearly
explained
by
keynes
in
his
formal
logic
dated
pp
that
i
prefer
to
quote
his
words
no
proposition
imply
the
existence
either
of
its
subject
or
of
its
take
as
an
example
a
syllogism
in
m
is
m
is
some
s
is
taking
s
m
p
as
the
minor
middle
and
major
terms
respectively
the
conclusion
will
imply
that
if
there
is
an
s
there
is
some
will
the
premisses
also
imply
this
if
so
then
the
syllogism
is
valid
but
not
otherwise
the
conclusion
implies
that
if
s
exists
p
exists
but
consistently
with
the
premisses
s
may
be
existent
while
m
and
p
are
both
an
implication
is
therefore
contained
in
the
conclusion
which
is
not
justified
by
the
premisses
this
seems
to
entirely
clear
and
convincing
still
to
make
sicker
i
may
as
well
throw
the
above
syllogism
into
a
concrete
form
which
will
be
within
the
grasp
of
even
a
reader
let
us
suppose
that
a
boys
school
has
been
set
up
with
the
following
system
of
rules
all
boys
in
the
first
the
highest
class
are
to
do
french
greek
and
latin
all
in
the
second
class
are
to
do
greek
only
all
in
the
third
class
are
to
do
latin
only
suppose
also
that
there
boys
in
the
third
class
and
in
the
second
but
that
no
boy
has
yet
risen
into
the
first
it
is
evident
that
there
are
no
boys
in
the
school
doing
french
still
we
know
by
the
rules
what
would
happen
if
there
any
we
are
authorised
then
by
the
to
assert
the
following
two
propositions
if
there
were
any
boys
doing
french
all
of
them
would
be
doing
greek
if
there
were
any
boys
doing
french
all
of
them
would
be
doing
latin
and
the
conclusion
according
to
the
logicians
would
be
if
there
were
any
boys
doing
latin
some
of
them
would
be
doing
greek
here
then
we
have
two
premisses
and
a
conclusion
since
we
know
that
there
boys
doing
latin
and
that
of
them
are
doing
greek
hence
the
argument
is
similarly
it
may
be
shown
that
this
interpretation
destroys
the
validity
of
and
some
of
the
logicians
will
no
doubt
be
ready
to
reply
but
we
are
not
why
should
be
responsible
for
the
validity
of
the
syllogisms
of
so
antiquated
an
author
as
aldrich
very
good
then
for
the
benefit
of
these
friends
of
mine
with
what
ominous
emphasis
that
name
is
sometimes
used
i
must
have
a
private
interview
with
my
young
says
the
bland
birch
in
my
library
at
tomorrow
and
you
will
please
to
be
for
their
benefit
i
say
i
will
produce
charge
against
this
interpretation
it
actually
invalidates
the
ordinary
process
of
conversion
as
applied
to
proposition
in
logician
aldrichian
or
otherwise
accepts
it
as
an
established
fact
that
some
x
are
y
may
be
legitimately
converted
into
some
y
are
x
but
is
it
equally
clear
that
the
proposition
if
there
any
x
some
of
them
be
y
may
be
legitimately
converted
into
if
there
any
y
some
of
them
would
be
x
i
trow
not
the
example
i
have
already
used
of
a
boys
school
with
a
first
class
will
serve
admirably
to
illustrate
this
new
flaw
in
the
theory
of
the
logicians
let
us
suppose
that
there
is
yet
rule
in
this
school
viz
in
each
class
at
the
end
of
the
term
the
head
boy
and
the
second
boy
shall
receive
prizes
this
rule
entirely
authorises
us
to
assert
in
the
sense
in
which
the
logicians
would
use
the
words
some
boys
in
the
first
class
will
receive
prizes
for
this
simply
means
according
to
them
if
there
any
boys
in
the
first
class
some
of
them
receive
prizes
now
the
converse
of
this
proposition
is
of
course
some
boys
who
will
receive
prizes
are
in
the
first
class
which
means
according
to
the
logicians
if
there
any
boys
about
to
receive
prizes
some
of
them
be
in
the
first
class
which
class
we
know
to
be
of
this
pair
of
converse
propositions
the
first
is
undoubtedly
the
second
undoubtedly
it
is
always
sad
to
see
a
batsman
knock
down
his
own
wicket
one
pities
him
as
a
man
and
a
brother
but
as
a
one
can
but
pronounce
him
out
we
see
then
that
among
all
the
conceivable
views
we
have
here
considered
there
are
only
which
can
be
held
viz
and
assert
but
does
not
and
assert
but
does
not
the
of
these
i
have
shown
to
involve
great
practical
inconvenience
the
is
the
one
adopted
in
this
book
see
p
some
further
remarks
on
this
subject
will
be
found
in
note
b
at
use
of
or
as
a
is
it
better
to
say
john
or
john
some
of
my
acquaintances
or
some
of
my
acquaintances
that
is
the
sort
of
question
we
have
now
to
discuss
this
is
no
question
of
logical
right
and
wrong
it
is
merely
a
matter
of
since
the
two
forms
mean
exactly
the
same
thing
and
here
again
the
logicians
seem
to
me
to
take
much
too
humble
a
position
when
they
are
putting
the
final
touches
to
the
grouping
of
their
proposition
just
before
the
curtain
goes
up
and
when
the
copula
always
a
rather
fussy
father
asks
them
am
to
have
the
or
will
you
tack
it
on
to
the
predicate
they
are
much
too
ready
to
answer
like
the
subtle
leave
it
to
sir
the
result
seems
to
be
that
the
grasping
copula
constantly
gets
a
not
that
had
better
have
been
merged
in
the
predicate
and
that
propositions
are
differentiated
which
had
better
have
been
recognised
as
precisely
similar
surely
it
is
simpler
to
treat
some
men
are
jews
and
some
men
are
gentiles
as
being
both
of
them
propositions
instead
of
translating
the
latter
into
some
men
jews
and
regarding
it
as
a
propositions
the
fact
is
the
logicians
have
somehow
acquired
a
perfectly
dread
of
negative
attributes
which
makes
them
shut
their
eyes
like
frightened
children
when
they
come
across
such
terrible
propositions
as
all
are
y
and
thus
they
exclude
from
their
system
many
very
useful
forms
of
syllogisms
under
the
influence
of
this
unreasoning
terror
they
plead
that
in
dichotomy
by
contradiction
the
part
is
too
large
to
deal
with
so
that
it
is
better
to
regard
each
thing
as
either
included
in
or
excluded
from
the
part
i
see
no
force
in
this
plea
and
the
facts
often
go
the
other
way
as
a
personal
question
dear
reader
if
were
to
group
your
acquaintances
into
the
two
classes
men
that
you
like
to
be
seen
with
and
men
that
you
would
like
to
be
seen
with
do
you
think
the
latter
group
would
be
so
much
the
larger
of
the
two
for
the
purposes
of
symbolic
logic
it
is
so
the
most
convenient
plan
to
regard
the
two
produced
by
dichotomy
on
the
footing
and
to
say
of
any
thing
either
that
it
is
in
the
one
or
that
it
is
in
the
other
that
i
do
not
think
any
reader
of
this
book
is
likely
to
demur
to
my
adopting
that
course
theory
that
two
negative
premisses
prove
nothing
this
i
consider
to
be
craze
of
the
logicians
fully
as
morbid
as
their
dread
of
a
negative
attribute
it
is
perhaps
best
refuted
by
the
method
of
take
the
following
pairs
of
premisses
none
of
my
boys
are
conceited
none
of
my
girls
are
greedy
none
of
my
boys
are
clever
none
but
a
clever
boy
could
solve
this
problem
none
of
my
boys
are
learned
some
of
my
boys
are
not
choristers
this
last
proposition
is
in
system
an
one
since
i
should
read
it
are
but
in
dealing
with
the
logicians
i
may
fairly
treat
it
as
a
one
since
would
read
it
choristers
if
you
dear
reader
declare
after
full
consideration
of
these
pairs
of
premisses
that
you
can
not
deduce
a
conclusion
from
of
them
why
all
i
can
say
is
that
like
the
duke
in
patience
you
will
have
to
be
contented
with
our
sympathy
see
note
c
p
method
of
diagrams
seem
to
have
been
used
at
first
to
represent
only
in
euler
circles
each
was
supposed
to
contain
a
class
and
the
diagram
consisted
of
two
circles
which
exhibited
the
relations
as
to
inclusion
and
exclusion
existing
between
the
two
classes
y
x
thus
the
diagram
here
given
exhibits
the
two
classes
whose
respective
attributes
are
x
and
y
as
so
related
to
each
other
that
the
following
propositions
are
all
simultaneously
true
all
x
are
y
no
x
are
some
x
are
y
some
y
are
some
are
and
of
course
the
converses
of
the
last
four
y
x
similarly
with
this
diagram
the
following
propositions
are
true
all
y
are
x
no
y
are
some
y
are
x
some
x
are
some
are
and
of
course
the
converses
of
the
last
four

similarly
with
this
diagram
the
following
are
true
all
x
are
all
y
are
no
x
are

some
x
are
some
y
are
some

and
the
converses
of
the
last
four

y
similarly
with
this
diagram
the
following
are
true
some
x
are
y
some
x
are
some
are
y
some
are
and
of
course
their
four
converses
note
that
euler
diagrams
assert
some
are
apparently
it
never
occured
to
him
that
it
might
fail
to
be
true
now
to
represent
all
x
are
y
the
of
these
diagrams
would
suffice
similarly
to
represent
no
x
are
y
the
would
suffice
but
to
represent
any
proposition
at
least
diagrams
would
be
needed
in
order
to
include
all
the
possible
cases
and
for
some
are
all
the
method
of
let
us
represent
by
x
venn
method
of
diagrams
is
a
great
advance
on
the
above
method
he
uses
the
last
of
the
above
diagrams
to
represent
desired
relation
between
x
and
y
by
simply
shading
a
compartment
known
to
be
and
placing
a
in
one
known
to
be
thus
he
would
represent
the
three
propositions
some
x
are
y
no
x
are
y
and
all
x
are
y
as
follows
it
will
be
seen
that
of
the
classes
whose
peculiar
sets
of
attributes
are
xy
xy
and
only
are
here
provided
with
closed
compartments
while
the
is
allowed
the
rest
of
the
infinite
plane
to
range
about
in
this
arrangement
would
involve
us
in
very
serious
trouble
if
we
ever
attempted
to
represent
no
x
are
y
venn
at
encounters
this
awful
task
but
evades
it
in
a
quite
masterly
fashion
by
the
simple
we
have
not
troubled
to
shade
the
outside
of
this
diagram
to
represent
propositions
containing
a
common
term
a
diagram
is
needed
this
is
the
one
used
by
venn
x
m
y
here
again
we
have
only
closed
compartments
to
accommodate
the
classes
whose
peculiar
sets
of
attributes
are
xym
xym
with
four
terms
in
request
venn
says
the
most
simple
and
symmetrical
diagram
seems
to
me
that
produced
by
making
four
ellipses
intersect
one
another
in
the
desired
manner
this
however
provides
only
closed
compartments
b
c
a
d
for
letters
the
simplest
diagram
i
can
suggest
venn
says
is
one
like
this
the
small
ellipse
in
the
centre
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
portion
of
the
of
c
its
four
component
portions
are
inside
b
and
d
but
are
no
part
of
c
it
must
be
admitted
that
such
a
diagram
is
not
quite
so
simple
to
draw
as
one
might
wish
it
to
be
but
then
consider
what
the
alternative
is
of
one
undertakes
to
deal
with
five
terms
and
all
their
combinations
nothing
short
of
the
disagreeable
task
of
writing
out
or
in
some
way
putting
before
us
all
the
combinations
involved
b
c
d
a
e
this
diagram
gives
us
closed
compartments
for
letters
venn
suggests
that
we
might
use
diagrams
like
the
above
one
for
the
and
the
other
for
the
of
all
the
other
combinations
this
he
says
would
give
the
desired
subdivisions
this
however
would
only
give
closed
compartments
and
infinite
area
which
the
two
classes
and
would
have
to
share
between
them
beyond
letters
venn
does
not
go
method
of
my
method
of
diagrams
venn
in
having
separate
compartments
assigned
to
the
various
classes
and
in
marking
these
compartments
as
or
as
but
it
from
his
method
in
assigning
a
area
to
the
of
so
that
the
class
which
under
venn
liberal
sway
has
been
ranging
at
will
through
infinite
space
is
suddenly
dismayed
to
find
itself
cabin
cribb
confined
in
a
limited
cell
like
any
other
class
also
i
use
instead
of
figures
and
i
mark
an
cell
with
a
meaning
that
there
is
at
least
thing
in
it
and
an
cell
with
a
meaning
that
there
is
thing
in
it
for
letters
i
use
this
diagram
in
which
the
north
half
is
assigned
to
the
south
to
or
the
west
to
y
and
the
east
to
y
thus
the
cell
contains
the
the
cell
the
and
so
on
for
letters
i
subdivide
these
four
cells
by
drawing
an
square
which
i
assign
to
m
the
border
being
assigned
to
m
i
thus
get
cells
that
are
needed
to
accommodate
the
eight
classes
whose
peculiar
sets
of
attributes
are
xym
xym
this
last
diagram
is
the
most
complex
that
i
use
in
the
part
of
my
logic
but
i
may
as
well
take
this
opportunity
of
describing
the
more
complex
ones
which
will
appear
in
part
ii
for
letters
which
i
call
a
b
c
d
i
use
this
diagram
assigning
the
north
half
to
a
and
of
course
the
of
the
diagram
to
a
the
west
half
to
b
the
horizontal
oblong
to
c
and
the
upright
oblong
to
we
have
now
got
cells
for
letters
adding
e
i
subdivide
the
cells
of
the
previous
diagram
by
partitions
assigning
all
the
portions
to
e
and
all
the
portions
to
e
here
i
admit
we
lose
the
advantage
of
having
the
all
in
a
like
the
other
classes
still
it
is
very
easy
to
find
and
the
operation
of
erasing
it
is
nearly
as
easy
as
that
of
erasing
any
other
class
we
have
now
got
cells
for
letters

mn
we
have
now
got
cells
of
a
syllogism
by
various
the
best
way
i
think
to
exhibit
the
differences
between
these
various
methods
of
solving
syllogisms
will
be
to
take
a
concrete
example
and
solve
it
by
each
method
in
turn
let
us
take
as
our
example
no
see
no
philosophers
are
conceited
some
conceited
persons
are
not
gamblers
some
persons
who
are
not
gamblers
are
not
philosophers
by
ordinary
these
premisses
as
they
stand
will
give
no
conclusion
as
they
are
both
negative
if
by
or
we
write
the
minor
premiss
thus
conceited
persons
are
we
can
get
a
conclusion
in
viz
no
philosophers
are
conceited
some
conceited
persons
are
some
are
not
philosophers
this
can
be
proved
by
reduction
to
thus
no
conceited
persons
are
philosophers
some
are
conceited
some
are
not
philosophers
the
validity
of
follows
directly
from
the
axiom
omni
et
before
proceeding
to
discuss
other
methods
of
solution
it
is
necessary
to
translate
our
syllogism
into
an
form
let
us
take
persons
as
our
of
discourse
and
let
x
philosophers
m
conceited
and
y
gamblers
then
the
syllogism
may
be
written
thus
no
x
are
m
some
m
are
y
some
y
are
x
by
euler
method
of
the
major
premiss
requires
only
diagram
viz
x
m
the
minor
requires
viz
y
m
y
m
y
m
the
combination
of
major
and
minor
in
every
possible
way
requires
viz
figs
and
give
x
y
m

m
xy

x

y
y
m
x
figs
and
give

x
y
m
x
m
y
figs
and
give
y
x
m
from
this
group
figs
to
we
have
by
disregarding
m
to
find
the
relation
of
x
and
y
on
examination
we
find
that
figs
express
the
relation
of
entire
mutual
exclusion
that
figs
express
partial
inclusion
and
partial
exclusion
that
fig
expresses
coincidence
that
figs
express
entire
inclusion
of
x
in
y
and
that
fig
expresses
entire
inclusion
of
y
in
we
thus
get
five
biliteral
diagrams
for
x
and
y
viz
x
y
x
y
xy
x
y
y
x
where
the
only
proposition
represented
by
them
all
is
some
are
some
persons
who
are
not
gamblers
are
not
philosophers
a
result
which
euler
would
hardly
have
regarded
as
a
one
since
he
seems
to
have
assumed
that
a
proposition
of
this
form
is
true
by
venn
method
of
the
following
solution
has
been
kindly
supplied
to
me
venn
himself
the
minor
premiss
declares
that
some
of
the
constituents
in
my
must
be
saved
mark
these
constituents
with
a
cross
m
y
the
major
declares
that
all
xm
must
be
destroyed
erase
it
then
as
some
my
is
to
be
saved
it
must
clearly
be
that
is
there
must
exist
or
eliminating
m
in
common
phraseology
y
are
x
or
are
by
my
method
of
the
first
premiss
asserts
that
no
xm
exist
so
we
mark
the
as
empty
by
placing
a
in
each
of
its
cells
the
second
asserts
that
some
my
exist
so
we
mark
the
as
occupied
by
placing
a
in
its
only
available
cell
o
o
i
the
only
information
that
this
gives
us
as
to
x
and
y
is
that
the
is
that
some
exist
hence
some
x
are
y
some
persons
who
are
not
philosophers
are
not
gamblers
by
my
method
of
some
persons
who
are
not
philosophers
are
not
gamblers
method
of
treating
syllogisms
and
of
all
the
strange
things
that
are
to
be
met
with
in
the
ordinary
of
formal
logic
perhaps
the
strangest
is
the
violent
contrast
one
finds
to
exist
between
their
ways
of
dealing
with
these
two
subjects
while
they
have
elaborately
discussed
no
less
than
different
forms
of
each
with
its
own
special
and
exasperating
rules
while
the
whole
constitute
an
almost
useless
machine
for
practical
purposes
many
of
the
conclusions
being
incomplete
and
many
quite
legitimate
forms
being
ignored
they
have
limited
to
forms
only
of
childish
simplicity
and
these
they
have
dignified
with
special
apparently
under
the
impression
that
no
other
possible
forms
existed
as
to
i
find
that
their
nineteen
forms
with
about
a
score
of
others
which
they
have
ignored
can
all
be
arranged
under
forms
each
with
a
very
simple
rule
of
its
own
and
the
only
question
the
reader
has
to
settle
in
working
any
one
of
the
examples
given
at
of
this
book
is
does
it
belong
to
fig
or
as
to
the
only
two
forms
recognised
by
the
are
the
whose
premisses
are
a
series
of
propositions
in
a
so
arranged
that
the
predicate
of
each
is
the
subject
of
the
next
and
the
whose
premisses
are
the
very
same
series
written
backwards
goclenius
it
seems
was
the
first
who
noticed
the
startling
fact
that
it
does
not
affect
the
force
of
a
syllogism
to
invert
the
order
of
its
premisses
and
who
applied
this
discovery
to
a
sorites
if
we
assume
as
surely
we
may
that
he
is
the
man
as
that
transcendent
genius
who
first
noticed
that
times
is
the
same
thing
as
times
we
may
apply
to
him
what
somebody
edmund
yates
i
think
it
was
has
said
of
tupper
here
is
a
man
who
beyond
all
others
of
his
generation
has
been
favoured
with
glimpses
of
the
obvious
these
puerile
not
to
say
infantine
forms
of
a
sorites
i
have
in
this
book
ignored
from
the
very
first
and
have
not
only
admitted
freely
propositions
in
but
have
purposely
stated
the
premisses
in
random
order
leaving
to
the
reader
the
useful
task
of
arranging
them
for
himself
in
an
order
which
can
be
worked
as
a
series
of
regular
syllogisms
in
doing
this
he
can
begin
with
of
them
he
likes
i
have
tabulated
for
curiosity
the
various
orders
in
which
the
premisses
of
the
aristotelian
sorites
all
a
are
b
all
b
are
c
all
c
are
d
all
d
are
e
all
e
are
h
all
a
are
may
be
syllogistically
arranged
and
i
find
there
are
no
less
than
such
orders
of
these
the
and
the
have
been
dignified
with
names
but
the
other
first
enumerated
by
an
obscure
writer
on
logic
towards
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
remain
without
a
name
account
of
parts
ii
in
part
ii
will
be
found
some
of
the
matters
mentioned
in
this
appendix
the
existential
import
of
propositions
the
use
of
a
copula
and
the
theory
that
two
negative
premisses
prove
nothing
i
shall
also
extend
the
range
of
syllogisms
by
introducing
propositions
containing
alternatives
such
as
x
are
y
propositions
containing
or
more
terms
such
as
all
ab
are
c
which
taken
along
with
some
bc
are
d
would
prove
some
d
are
a
i
shall
also
discuss
sorites
containing
entities
and
the
puzzling
subjects
of
hypotheticals
and
dilemmas
i
hope
in
the
course
of
part
to
go
over
all
the
ground
usually
traversed
in
the
used
in
our
schools
and
universities
and
to
enable
my
readers
to
solve
problems
of
the
same
kind
as
and
far
harder
than
those
that
are
at
present
set
in
their
examinations
in
part
iii
i
hope
to
deal
with
many
curious
and
subjects
some
of
which
are
not
even
alluded
to
in
any
of
the
treatises
i
have
met
with
in
this
part
will
be
found
such
matters
as
the
analysis
of
propositions
into
their
elements
let
the
reader
who
has
never
gone
into
this
branch
of
the
subject
try
to
make
out
for
himself
what
proposition
would
be
needed
to
convert
some
a
are
b
into
some
a
are
bc
the
treatment
of
numerical
and
geometrical
problems
the
construction
of
problems
and
the
solution
of
syllogisms
and
sorites
containing
propositions
more
complex
than
any
that
i
have
used
in
part
ii
i
will
conclude
with
eight
problems
as
a
taste
of
what
is
coming
in
part
ii
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
receive
from
any
reader
who
thinks
he
has
solved
any
one
of
them
more
especially
if
he
has
done
so
using
any
method
of
symbols
what
he
conceives
to
be
its
complete
conclusion
it
may
be
well
to
explain
what
i
mean
by
the
conclusion
of
a
syllogism
or
a
sorites
i
distinguish
their
terms
as
being
of
two
kinds
those
which
be
eliminated
the
middle
term
of
a
syllogism
which
i
call
the
eliminands
and
those
which
which
i
call
the
retinends
and
i
do
not
call
the
conclusion
unless
it
states
the
relations
among
the
retinends
only
which
can
be
deduced
from
the
premisses

at

remembering
how
much
amusement
they

from

of
rules
for
they
devised
the
following
rules
to
be
observed
whenever
beef
appeared
on
the
table
if
barry
takes
salt
then
either
cole
or

takes
only
of
the
two
condiments
salt
and

if

then

takes

if

if

the
problem
is
to
discover
whether
these
rules
are
and
if
so
what
arrangements
are
possible
in
this
problem
it
is
assumed
that
the
phrase
if
barry
takes
salt
allows
of
possible
cases
viz
he
takes
salt
he
takes
condiments
and
so
with
all
similar
phrases
it
is
also
assumed
that
the
phrase
either
cole
or
lang
takes
only
of
the
two
condiments
allows
possible
cases
viz
cole
takes
only
lang
takes
both
or
neither
cole
takes
both
or
neither
lang
takes
only
cole
takes
only
lang
takes
only
and
so
with
all
similar
phrases
it
is
also
assumed
that
every
rule
is
to
be
understood
as
implying
the
words
and
thus
the
first
rule
would
imply
the
addition
and
if
either
cole

takes
only
condiment
then
barry
takes
salt

as
the
conclusion

it
is

use
as
premisses

only
all
that
is
here
but
also
all
that
we
may
reasonably
understand
to
be
notes
to
appendix
a
see
line
it
may
perhaps
occur
to
the
reader
who
has
studied
formal
logic
that
the
argument
here
applied
to
the
propositions
i
and
e
will
apply
equally
well
to
the
propositions
i
and
a
since
in
the
ordinary
the
propositions
all
xy
are
z
and
some
xy
are
not
z
are
regarded
as
contradictories
hence
it
may
appear
to
him
that
the
argument
might
have
been
put
as
follows
we
now
have
i
and
a
hence
if
the
proposition
xy
are
z
be
true
some
things
exist
with
the
attributes
x
and
y
x
are
y
also
we
know
that
if
the
proposition
xy
are
be
true
the
same
result
follows
but
these
two
propositions
are
contradictories
so
that
one
or
other
of
them
be
true
hence
this
result
is
always
true
the
proposition
x
are
y
is
true
est
hence
i
assert
this
matter
will
be
discussed
in
part
ii
but
i
may
as
well
give
here
what
seems
to
me
to
be
an
irresistable
proof
that
this
view
that
and
are
contradictories
though
adopted
in
the
ordinary
is
untenable
the
proof
is
as
follows
with
regard
to
the
relationship
existing
between
the
class
and
the
two
classes
and
there
are
conceivable
states
of
things
viz
some
xy
are
z
and
some
are
none
no
xy
some
none
of
these
four
no
is
equivalent
to
all
xy
are
z
no
is
equivalent
to
all
xy
are
and
no
is
equivalent
to
no
xy
exist
now
it
is
quite
undeniable
that
of
these
states
of
things
each
is
some
be
true
and
the
other
three
be
false
hence
the
contradictory
to
is
either
or
or
is
true
now
the
assertion
either
or
is
true
is
equivalent
to
some
xy
are
and
the
assertion
is
true
is
equivalent
to
no
xy
exist
hence
the
contradictory
to
all
xy
are
z
may
be
expressed
as
the
alternative
proposition
either
some
xy
are
or
no
xy
exist
but
as
the
categorical
proposition
some
y
are
b
see
at
end
of
section
there
are
yet
views
current
among
the
logicians
as
to
the
existential
import
of
propositions
which
have
not
been
mentioned
in
this
section
one
is
that
the
proposition
some
x
are
y
is
to
be
interpreted
neither
as
some
x
and
are
y
nor
yet
as
if
there
any
x
in
existence
some
of
them
be
y
but
merely
as
some
x
y
the
attributes
x
and
y
are
on
theory
there
would
be
nothing
offensive
in
my
telling
my
friend
jones
some
of
your
brothers
are
swindlers
since
if
he
indignantly
retorted
what
do
you
by
such
insulting
language
you
scoundrel
i
should
calmly
reply
i
merely
mean
that
the
thing
is
that
some
of
your
brothers
be
swindlers
but
it
may
well
be
doubted
whether
such
an
explanation
would
appease
the
wrath
of
jones
another
view
is
that
the
proposition
all
x
are
y
implies
the
actual
of
x
and
does
imply
it
and
that
we
can
not
tell
without
having
it
in
form
interpretation
we
are
to
give
to
it
view
is
i
think
strongly
supported
by
common
usage
and
it
will
be
fully
discussed
in
part
ii
but
the
difficulties
which
it
introduces
seem
to
me
too
formidable
to
be
