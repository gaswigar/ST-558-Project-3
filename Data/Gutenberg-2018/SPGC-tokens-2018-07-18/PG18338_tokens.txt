introduction
to
lyrics
of
lowly
life
i
think
i
should
scarcely
trouble
the
reader
with
a
special
appeal
in
behalf
of
this
book
if
it
had
not
specially
appealed
to
me
for
reasons
apart
from
the
author
race
origin
and
condition
the
world
is
too
old
now
and
i
find
myself
too
much
of
its
mood
to
care
for
the
work
of
a
poet
because
he
is
black
because
his
father
and
mother
were
slaves
because
he
was
before
and
after
he
began
to
write
poems
an
these
facts
would
certainly
attract
me
to
him
as
a
man
if
i
knew
him
to
have
a
literary
ambition
but
when
it
came
to
his
literary
art
i
must
judge
it
irrespective
of
these
facts
and
enjoy
or
endure
it
for
what
it
was
in
itself
it
seems
to
me
that
this
was
my
experience
with
the
poetry
of
paul
laurence
dunbar
when
i
found
it
in
another
form
and
in
justice
to
him
i
can
not
wish
that
it
should
be
otherwise
with
his
readers
here
still
it
will
legitimately
interest
those
who
like
to
know
the
causes
or
if
these
may
not
be
known
the
sources
of
things
to
learn
that
the
father
and
mother
of
the
first
poet
of
his
race
in
our
language
were
negroes
without
admixture
of
white
blood
the
father
escaped
from
slavery
in
kentucky
to
freedom
in
canada
while
there
was
still
no
hope
of
freedom
otherwise
but
the
mother
was
freed
by
the
events
of
the
civil
war
and
came
north
to
ohio
where
their
son
was
born
at
dayton
and
grew
up
with
such
chances
and
mischances
for
mental
training
as
everywhere
befall
the
children
of
the
poor
he
has
told
me
that
his
father
picked
up
the
trade
of
a
plasterer
and
when
he
had
taught
himself
to
read
loved
chiefly
to
read
history
the
boy
mother
shared
his
passion
for
literature
with
a
special
love
of
poetry
and
after
the
father
died
she
struggled
on
in
more
than
the
poverty
she
had
shared
with
him
she
could
value
the
faculty
which
her
son
showed
first
in
prose
sketches
and
attempts
at
fiction
and
she
was
proud
of
the
praise
and
kindness
they
won
him
among
the
people
of
the
town
where
he
has
never
been
without
the
warmest
and
kindest
friends
in
fact
from
every
part
of
ohio
and
from
several
cities
of
the
adjoining
states
there
came
letters
in
cordial
appreciation
of
the
critical
recognition
which
it
was
my
pleasure
no
less
than
my
duty
to
offer
paul
dunbar
work
in
another
place
it
seemed
to
me
a
happy
omen
for
him
that
so
many
people
who
had
known
him
or
known
of
him
were
glad
of
a
stranger
good
word
and
it
was
gratifying
to
see
that
at
home
he
was
esteemed
for
the
things
he
had
done
rather
than
because
as
the
son
of
negro
slaves
he
had
done
them
if
a
prophet
is
often
without
honor
in
his
own
country
it
surely
is
nothing
against
him
when
he
has
it
in
this
case
it
deprived
me
of
the
glory
of
a
discoverer
but
that
is
sometimes
a
barren
joy
and
i
am
always
willing
to
forego
it
what
struck
me
in
reading
dunbar
poetry
was
what
had
already
struck
his
friends
in
ohio
and
indiana
in
kentucky
and
illinois
they
had
felt
as
i
felt
that
however
gifted
his
race
had
proven
itself
in
music
in
oratory
in
several
of
the
other
arts
here
was
the
first
instance
of
an
american
negro
who
had
evinced
innate
distinction
in
literature
in
my
criticism
of
his
book
i
had
alleged
dumas
in
france
and
i
had
forgetfully
failed
to
allege
the
far
greater
pushkin
in
russia
but
these
were
both
mulattoes
who
might
have
been
supposed
to
derive
their
qualities
from
white
blood
vastly
more
artistic
than
ours
and
who
were
the
creatures
of
an
environment
more
favorable
to
their
literary
development
so
far
as
i
could
remember
paul
dunbar
was
the
only
man
of
pure
african
blood
and
of
american
civilization
to
feel
the
negro
life
aesthetically
and
express
it
lyrically
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
had
come
to
its
most
modern
consciousness
in
him
and
that
his
brilliant
and
unique
achievement
was
to
have
studied
the
american
negro
objectively
and
to
have
represented
him
as
he
found
him
to
be
with
humor
with
sympathy
and
yet
with
what
the
reader
must
instinctively
feel
to
be
entire
truthfulness
i
said
that
a
race
which
had
come
to
this
effect
in
any
member
of
it
had
attained
civilization
in
him
and
i
permitted
myself
the
imaginative
prophecy
that
the
hostilities
and
the
prejudices
which
had
so
long
constrained
his
race
were
destined
to
vanish
in
the
arts
that
these
were
to
be
the
final
proof
that
god
had
made
of
one
blood
all
nations
of
men
i
thought
his
merits
positive
and
not
comparative
and
i
held
that
if
his
black
poems
had
been
written
by
a
white
man
i
should
not
have
found
them
less
admirable
i
accepted
them
as
an
evidence
of
the
essential
unity
of
the
human
race
which
does
not
think
or
feel
black
in
one
and
white
in
another
but
humanly
in
all
yet
it
appeared
to
me
then
and
it
appears
to
me
now
that
there
is
a
precious
difference
of
temperament
between
the
races
which
it
would
be
a
great
pity
ever
to
lose
and
that
this
is
best
preserved
and
most
charmingly
suggested
by
dunbar
in
those
pieces
of
his
where
he
studies
the
moods
and
traits
of
his
race
in
its
own
accent
of
our
english
we
call
such
pieces
dialect
pieces
for
want
of
some
closer
phrase
but
they
are
really
not
dialect
so
much
as
delightful
personal
attempts
and
failures
for
the
written
and
spoken
language
in
nothing
is
his
essentially
refined
and
delicate
art
so
well
shown
as
in
these
pieces
which
as
i
ventured
to
say
described
the
range
between
appetite
and
emotion
with
certain
lifts
far
beyond
and
above
it
which
is
the
range
of
the
race
he
reveals
in
these
a
finely
ironical
perception
of
the
negro
limitations
with
a
tenderness
for
them
which
i
think
so
very
rare
as
to
be
almost
quite
new
i
should
say
perhaps
that
it
was
this
humorous
quality
which
dunbar
had
added
to
our
literature
and
it
would
be
this
which
would
most
distinguish
him
now
and
hereafter
it
is
something
that
one
feels
in
nearly
all
the
dialect
pieces
and
i
hope
that
in
the
present
collection
he
has
kept
all
of
these
in
his
earlier
volume
and
added
others
to
them
but
the
contents
of
this
book
are
wholly
of
his
own
choosing
and
i
do
not
know
how
much
or
little
he
may
have
preferred
the
poems
in
literary
english
some
of
these
i
thought
very
good
and
even
more
than
very
good
but
not
distinctively
his
contribution
to
the
body
of
american
poetry
what
i
mean
is
that
several
people
might
have
written
them
but
i
do
not
know
any
one
else
at
present
who
could
quite
have
written
the
dialect
pieces
these
are
divinations
and
reports
of
what
passes
in
the
hearts
and
minds
of
a
lowly
people
whose
poetry
had
hitherto
been
inarticulately
expressed
in
music
but
now
finds
for
the
first
time
in
our
tongue
literary
interpretation
of
a
very
artistic
completeness
i
say
the
event
is
interesting
but
how
important
it
shall
be
can
be
determined
only
by
dunbar
future
performance
i
can
not
undertake
to
prophesy
concerning
this
but
if
he
should
do
nothing
more
than
he
has
done
i
should
feel
that
he
had
made
the
strongest
claim
for
the
negro
in
english
literature
that
the
negro
has
yet
made
he
has
at
least
produced
something
that
however
we
may
critically
disagree
about
it
we
can
not
well
refuse
to
enjoy
in

ere

to

the
weary
eyes
ere
sleep
comes
down
to
soothe
the
weary
eyes
which
all
the
day
with
ceaseless
care
have
sought
the
magic
gold
which
from
the
seeker
flies
ere
dreams
put
on
the
gown
and
cap
of
thought
and
make
the
waking
world
a
world
of
lies
of
lies
most
palpable
uncouth
forlorn
that
say
life
full
of
aches
and
tears
and
sighs
oh
how
with
more
than
dreams
the
soul
is
torn
ere
sleep
comes
down
to
soothe
the
weary
eyes
ere
sleep
comes
down
to
soothe
the
weary
eyes
how
all
the
griefs
and
we
have
known
come
up
like
vapors
that
arise
from
some
base
witch
caldron
when
the
crone
to
work
some
potent
spell
her
magic
plies
the
past
which
held
its
share
of
bitter
pain
whose
ghost
we
prayed
that
time
might
exorcise
comes
up
is
lived
and
suffered
again
ere
sleep
comes
down
to
soothe
the
weary
eyes
ere
sleep
comes
down
to
soothe
the
weary
eyes
what
phantoms
fill
the
dimly
lighted
room
what
ghostly
shades
in
guise
are
bodied
forth
within
the
teeming
gloom
what
echoes
faint
of
sad
and
cries
and
pangs
of
vague
inexplicable
pain
that
pay
the
spirit
ceaseless
enterprise
come
thronging
through
the
chambers
of
the
brain
ere
sleep
comes
down
to
soothe
the
weary
eyes
ere
sleep
comes
down
to
soothe
the
weary
eyes
where
ranges
forth
the
spirit
far
and
free
through
what
strange
realms
and
unfamiliar
skies
tends
her
far
course
to
lands
of
mystery
to
lands
unspeakable
beyond
surmise
where
shapes
unknowable
to
being
spring
till
faint
of
wing
the
fancy
fails
and
dies
much
wearied
with
the
spirit
journeying
ere
sleep
comes
down
to
soothe
the
weary
eyes
ere
sleep
comes
down
to
soothe
the
weary
eyes
how
questioneth
the
soul
that
other
soul
the
inner
sense
which
neither
cheats
nor
lies
but
self
exposes
unto
self
a
scroll
full
writ
with
all
life
acts
unwise
or
wise
in
characters
indelible
and
known
so
trembling
with
the
shock
of
sad
surprise
the
soul
doth
view
its
awful
self
alone
ere
sleep
comes
down
to
soothe
the
weary
eyes
when
sleep
comes
down
to
seal
the
weary
eyes
the
last
dear
sleep
whose
soft
embrace
is
balm
and
whom
sad
sorrow
teaches
us
to
prize
for
kissing
all
our
passions
into
calm
ah
then
no
more
we
heed
the
sad
world
cries
or
seek
to
probe
th
eternal
mystery
or
fret
our
souls
at
replies
at
glooms
through
which
our
visions
can
not
see
when
sleep
comes
down
to
seal
the
weary
eyes
the
poet
and
his
song
a
song
is
but
a
little
thing
and
yet
what
joy
it
is
to
sing
in
hours
of
toil
it
gives
me
zest
and
when
at
eve
i
long
for
rest
when
cows
come
home
along
the
bars
and
in
the
fold
i
hear
the
bell
as
night
the
shepherd
herds
his
stars
i
sing
my
song
and
all
is
well
there
are
no
ears
to
hear
my
lays
no
lips
to
lift
a
word
of
praise
but
still
with
faith
unfaltering
i
live
and
laugh
and
love
and
sing
what
matters
yon
unheeding
throng
they
can
not
feel
my
spirit
spell
since
life
is
sweet
and
love
is
long
i
sing
my
song
and
all
is
well
my
days
are
never
days
of
ease
i
till
my
ground
and
prune
my
trees
when
ripened
gold
is
all
the
plain
i
put
my
sickle
to
the
grain
i
labor
hard
and
toil
and
sweat
while
others
dream
within
the
dell
but
even
while
my
brow
is
wet
i
sing
my
song
and
all
is
well
sometimes
the
sun
unkindly
hot
my
garden
makes
a
desert
spot
sometimes
a
blight
upon
the
tree
takes
all
my
fruit
away
from
me
and
then
with
throes
of
bitter
pain
rebellious
passions
rise
and
swell
but
life
is
more
than
fruit
or
grain
and
so
i
sing
and
all
is
well
retort
thou
art
a
fool

thou

frederick
douglass
a
hush
is
over
all
the
teeming
lists
and
there
is
pause
a
in
the
strife
a
spirit
brave
has
passed
beyond
the
mists
and
vapors
that
obscure
the
sun
of
life
and
ethiopia
with
bosom
torn
laments
the
passing
of
her
noblest
born
she
weeps
for
him
a
mother
burning
tears
she
loved
him
with
a
mother
deepest
love
he
was
her
champion
thro
direful
years
and
held
her
weal
all
other
ends
above
when
bondage
held
her
bleeding
in
the
dust
he
raised
her
up
and
whispered
hope
and
trust
for
her
his
voice
a
fearless
clarion
rung
that
broke
in
warning
on
the
ears
of
men
for
her
the
strong
bow
of
his
power
he
strung
and
sent
his
arrows
to
the
very
den
where
grim
oppression
held
his
bloody
place
and
gloated
the
of
a
race
and
he
was
no
apologist
he
spoke
straightforward
fearlessly
uncowed
the
sunlight
of
his
truth
dispelled
the
mist
and
set
in
bold
relief
each
dark
hued
cloud
to
sin
and
crime
he
gave
their
proper
hue
and
hurled
at
evil
what
was
evil
due
through
good
and
ill
report
he
cleaved
his
way
right
onward
with
his
face
set
toward
the
heights
nor
feared
to
face
the
foeman
dread
array
the
lash
of
scorn
the
sting
of
petty
spites
he
dared
the
lightning
in
the
lightning
track
and
answered
thunder
with
his
thunder
back
when
men
maligned
him
and
their
torrent
wrath
in
furious
imprecations
him
broke
he
kept
his
counsel
as
he
kept
his
path
was
for
his
race
not
for
himself
he
spoke
he
knew
the
import
of
his
master
call
and
felt
himself
too
mighty
to
be
small
no
miser
in
the
good
he
held
was
he
his
kindness
followed
his
horizon
rim
his
heart
his
talents
and
his
hands
were
free
to
all
who
truly
needed
aught
of
him
where
poverty
and
ignorance
were
rife
he
gave
his
bounty
as
he
gave
his
life
the
place
and
cause
that
first
aroused
his
might
still
proved
its
power
until
his
latest
day
in
freedom
lists
and
for
the
aid
of
right
still
in
the
foremost
rank
he
waged
the
fray
wrong
lived
his
occupation
was
not
gone
he
died
in
action
with
his
armor
on
we
weep
for
him
but
we
have
touched
his
hand
and
felt
the
magic
of
his
presence
nigh
the
current
that
he
sent
throughout
the
land
the
kindling
spirit
of
his
all
that
holds
us
we
shall
triumph
yet
and
place
our
banner
where
his
hopes
were
set
oh
douglass
thou
hast
passed
beyond
the
shore
but
still
thy
voice
is
ringing
the
gale
thou
taught
thy
race
how
high
her
hopes
may
soar
and
bade
her
seek
the
heights
nor
faint
nor
fail
she
will
not
fail
she
heeds
thy
stirring
cry
she
knows
thy
guardian
spirit
will
be
nigh
and
rising
from
beneath
the
rod
she
stretches
out
her
bleeding
hands
to
god
life
a
crust
of
bread
and
a
corner
to
sleep
in
a
minute
to
smile
and
an
hour
to
weep
in
a
pint
of
joy
to
a
peck
of
trouble
and
never
a
laugh
but
the
moans
come
double
and
that
is
life
a
crust
and
a
corner
that
love
makes
precious
with
a
smile
to
warm
and
the
tears
to
refresh
us
and
joy
seems
sweeter
when
cares
come
after
and
a
moan
is
the
finest
of
foils
for
laughter
and
that
is
life
the
lesson
my
cot
was
down
by
a
cypress
grove
and
i
sat
by
my
window
the
whole
night
long
and
heard
well
up
from
the
deep
dark
wood
a
passionate
song
and
i
thought
of
myself
so
sad
and
lone
and
my
life
cold
winter
that
knew
no
spring
of
my
mind
so
weary
and
sick
and
wild
of
my
heart
too
sad
to
sing
but
as
i
listened
the
song
a
thought
stole
into
my
saddened
heart
and
i
said
i
can
cheer
some
other
soul
by
a
carol
simple
art
for
oft
from
the
darkness
of
hearts
and
lives
come
songs
that
brim
with
joy
and
light
as
out
of
the
gloom
of
the
cypress
grove
the
sings
at
night
so
i
sang
a
lay
for
a
brother
ear
in
a
strain
to
soothe
his
bleeding
heart
and
he
smiled
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
and
lyre
though
mine
was
a
feeble
art
but
at
his
smile
i
smiled
in
turn
and
into
my
soul
there
came
a
ray
in
trying
to
soothe
another
woes
mine
own
had
passed
away
the
rising
of
the
storm
the
lake
dark
breast
is
all
unrest
it
heaves
with
a
sob
and
a
sigh
like
a
tremulous
bird
from
its
slumber
stirred
the
moon
is
in
the
sky
from
the
silent
deep
the
waters
sweep
but
faint
on
the
cold
white
stones
and
the
wavelets
fly
with
a
plaintive
cry
the
old
earth
bare
bleak
bones
and
the
spray
upsprings
on
its
wings
and
tosses
a
kiss
at
the
stars
while
a
in
dight
hums
a
solemn
bars
far
out
in
the
night
on
the
wavering
sight
i
see
a
dark
hull
loom
and
its
light
on
high
like
a
cyclops
eye
shines
out
through
the
mist
and
gloom
now
the
winds
well
up
from
the
earth
deep
cup
and
fall
on
the
sea
and
shore
and
against
the
pier
the
waters
rear
and
break
with
a
sullen
roar
up
comes
the
gale
and
the
veil
gives
way
to
the
lightning
glare
and
the
fall
a
sombre
pall
water
earth
and
air
the
flies
his
whip
he
plies
and
bellows
down
the
wind
the
lightning
rash
with
blinding
flash
comes
pricking
on
behind
rise
waters
rise
and
taunt
the
skies
with
your
form
sweep
wild
winds
sweep
and
tear
the
deep
to
atoms
in
the
storm
and
the
waters
leapt
and
the
wild
winds
swept
and
blew
out
the
moon
in
the
sky
and
i
laughed
with
glee
it
was
joy
to
me
as
the
storm
went
raging
by
sunset
the
river
sleeps
beneath
the
sky
and
clasps
the
shadows
to
its
breast
the
crescent
moon
shines
dim
on
high
and
in
the
lately
radiant
west
the
gold
is
fading
into
gray
now
stills
the
lark
his
festive
lay
and
mourns
with
me
the
dying
day
while
in
the
south
the
first
faint
star
lifts
to
the
night
its
silver
face
and
twinkles
to
the
moon
afar
across
the
heaven
graying
space
low
murmurs
reach
me
from
the
town
as
day
puts
on
her
sombre
crown
and
shakes
her
mantle
darkly
down
the
old
there
a
memory
keeps
through
my
weary
head
an
i
see
a
picture
in
the
ruddy
light
is
the
picture
of
an
orchard
wrapped
in
autumn
purple
haze
with
the
tender
light
about
it
that
i
loved
in
other
days
an
in
a
corner
once
again
i
seem
to
see
the
verdant
leaves
an
branches
of
an
old
you
perhaps
would
call
it
ugly
an
i
do
know
but
it
so
when
you
look
the
tree
all
over
unadorned
by
memory
glow
for
its
boughs
are
gnarled
an
crooked
an
its
leaves
are
gettin
thin
an
the
apples
of
its
would
fill
so
large
a
bin
as
they
used
to
but
i
tell
you
when
it
comes
to
pleasin
me
it
the
dearest
in
the
orchard
is
that
old
i
would
hide
within
its
shelter
settlin
in
some
cosy
nook
where
no
calls
nor
threats
could
stir
me
from
the
pages
o
my
book
oh
that
quiet
sweet
seclusion
in
its
fulness
passeth
words
it
was
deeper
than
the
deepest
that
my
sanctum
now
affords
why
the
jaybirds
an
the
robins
they
was
hand
in
glove
with
me
as
they
winked
at
me
an
warbled
in
that
old
it
was
on
its
sturdy
branches
that
in
summers
long
ago
i
would
tie
my
swing
an
dangle
in
contentment
to
an
fro
idly
dreamin
childish
fancies
buildin
castles
in
the
air
makin
o
myself
a
hero
of
romances
rich
an
rare
i
kin
shet
my
eyes
an
see
it
jest
as
plain
as
plain
kin
be
that
same
old
swing
to
the
old
there
a
rustic
seat
beneath
it
that
i
never
kin
forget
it
the
place
where
me
an
hallie
little
sweetheart
used
to
set
when
we
wander
to
the
orchard
so
no
listenin
ones
could
hear
as
i
whispered
sugared
nonsense
into
her
little
willin
ear
now
my
gray
old
wife
is
hallie
an
i
grayer
still
than
she
but
i
not
forget
our
the
old
life
for
us
ai
all
been
summer
but
i
guess
we
had
our
share
of
its
flittin
joys
an
pleasures
an
a
sprinklin
of
its
care
oft
the
skies
have
smiled
upon
us
then
again
we
seen
frown
though
our
load
was
so
heavy
that
we
longed
to
lay
it
down
but
when
death
does
come
this
my
last
request
shall
be
that
they
bury
me
an
hallie
the
old
apple
tree
a
prayer
o
lord
the
miles
have
worn
my
stumbling
feet
oh
soothe
me
with
thy
smiles
and
make
my
life
complete
the
thorns
were
thick
and
keen
i
trembling
trod
the
way
was
long
between
my
wounded
feet
and
god
where
healing
waters
flow
do
thou
my
footsteps
lead
my
heart
is
aching
so
thy
gracious
balm
i
need
passion
and
love
a
maiden
wept
and
as
a
comforter
came
one
who
cried
i
love
thee
and
he
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
with
hot
breath
that
dried
the
tears
upon
her
flaming
cheeks
while
evermore
his
boldly
blazing
eye
burned
into
hers
but
she
uncomforted
shrank
from
his
arms
and
only
wept
the
more
then
one
came
and
gazed
mutely
in
her
face
with
wide
and
wistful
eyes
but
still
aloof
he
held
himself
as
with
a
reverent
fear
as
one
who
knows
some
sacred
presence
nigh
and
as
she
wept
he
mingled
tear
with
tear
that
cheered
her
soul
like
dew
a
dusty
flower
until
she
smiled
approached
and
touched
his
hand
the
seedling
as
a
quiet
little
seedling
lay
within
its
darksome
bed
to
itself
it
fell
and
this
is
what
it
said
i
am
not
so
very
robust
but
i
do
the
best
i
can
and
the
seedling
from
that
moment
its
work
of
life
began
so
it
pushed
a
little
leaflet
up
into
the
light
of
day
to
examine
the
surroundings
and
show
the
rest
the
way
the
leaflet
liked
the
prospect
so
it
called
its
brother
stem
then
two
other
leaflets
heard
it
and
quickly
followed
them
to
be
sure
the
haste
and
hurry
made
the
seedling
sweat
and
pant
but
almost
before
it
knew
it
it
found
itself
a
plant
the
sunshine
poured
upon
it
and
the
clouds
they
gave
a
shower
and
the
little
plant
kept
growing
till
it
found
itself
a
flower
little
folks
be
like
the
seedling
always
do
the
best
you
can
every
child
must
share
life
labor
just
as
well
as
every
man
and
the
sun
and
showers
will
help
you
through
the
lonesome
struggling
hours
till
you
raise
to
light
and
beauty
virtue
fair
unfading
flowers
promise
i
grew
a
rose
within
a
garden
fair
and
tending
it
with
more
than
loving
care
i
thought
how
with
the
glory
of
its
bloom
i
should
the
darkness
of
my
life
illume
and
watching
ever
smiled
to
see
the
lusty
bud
drink
freely
in
the
summer
sun
to
tinct
its
blood
my
rose
began
to
open
and
its
hue
was
sweet
to
me
as
to
it
sun
and
dew
i
watched
it
taking
on
its
ruddy
flame
until
the
day
of
perfect
blooming
came
then
hasted
i
with
smiles
to
find
it
blushing
red
too
late
some
thoughtless
child
had
plucked
my
rose
and
fled
fulfilment
i
grew
a
rose
once
more
to
please
mine
eyes
all
things
to
aid
it
dew
sun
wind
fair
skies
were
kindly
and
to
shield
it
from
despoil
i
fenced
it
safely
in
with
grateful
toil
no
other
hand
than
mine
shall
pluck
this
flower
said
i
and
i
was
jealous
of
the
bee
that
hovered
nigh
it
grew
for
days
i
stood
hour
after
hour
to
watch
the
slow
unfolding
of
the
flower
and
then
i
did
not
leave
its
side
at
all
lest
some
mischance
my
flower
should
befall
at
last
oh
joy
the
central
petals
burst
apart
it
blossomed
but
alas
a
worm
was
at
its
heart
song
my
heart
to
thy
heart
my
hand
to
thine
my
lip
to
thy
lips
kisses
are
wine
brewed
for

unwavering
this

to
thy
glory
i
know
the
pangs
which
thou
didst
feel
when
slavery
crushed
thee
with
its
heel
with
thy
dear
blood
all
gory
sad
days
were
those
ah
sad
indeed
but
through
the
land
the
fruitful
seed
of
better
times
was
growing
the
plant
of
freedom
upward
sprung
and
spread
its
leaves
so
fresh
and
young
its
blossoms
now
are
blowing
on
every
hand
in
this
fair
land
proud
ethiope
swarthy
children
stand
beside
their
fairer
neighbor
the
forests
flee
before
their
stroke
their
hammers
ring
their
forges
smoke
they
stir
in
honest
labour
they
tread
the
fields
where
honour
calls
their
voices
sound
through
senate
halls
in
majesty
and
power
to
right
they
cling
the
hymns
they
sing
up
to
the
skies
in
beauty
ring
and
bolder
grow
each
hour
be
proud
my
race
in
mind
and
soul
thy
name
is
writ
on
glory
scroll
in
characters
of
fire
high
the
clouds
of
fame
bright
sky
thy
banner
blazoned
folds
now
fly
and
truth
shall
lift
them
higher
thou
hast
the
right
to
noble
pride
whose
spotless
robes
were
purified
by
blood
severe
baptism
upon
thy
brow
the
cross
was
laid
and
labour
painful
made
a
consecrating
chrism
no
other
race
or
white
or
black
when
bound
as
thou
wert
to
the
rack
so
seldom
stooped
to
grieving
no
other
race
when
free
again
forgot
the
past
and
proved
them
men
so
noble
in
forgiving
go
on
and
up
our
souls
and
eyes
shall
follow
thy
continuous
rise
our
ears
shall
list
thy
story
from
bards
who
from
thy
root
shall
spring
and
proudly
tune
their
lyres
to
sing
of
ethiopia
glory
the
fiddle
when
the
corn
all
cut
and
the
bright
stalks
shine
like
the
burnished
spears
of
a
field
of
gold
when
the
rich
on
the
nubbins
dine
and
the
frost
comes
white
and
the
wind
blows
cold
then
it
heigho
fellows
and
for
the
time
is
ripe
for
the
fiddle
and
you
take
a
stalk
that
is
straight
and
long
with
an
expert
eye
to
its
worthy
points
and
you
think
of
the
bubbling
strains
of
song
that
are
bound
between
its
pithy
joints
then
you
cut
out
strings
with
a
bridge
in
the
middle
with
a
bow
for
a
fiddle
then
the
strains
that
grow
as
you
draw
the
bow
the
yielding
strings
with
a
practised
hand
and
the
music
flow
never
loud
but
low
is
the
concert
note
of
a
fairy
band
oh
your
dainty
songs
are
a
misty
riddle
to
the
simple
sweets
of
the
fiddle
when
the
eve
comes
on
and
our
work
is
done
and
the
sun
drops
down
with
a
tender
glance
with
their
hearts
all
prime
for
the
harmless
fun
come
the
neighbor
girls
for
the
evening
dance
and
they
wait
for
the
twist
and
twiddle
more
time
than
tune
from
the
fiddle
then
brother
jabez
takes
the
bow
while
ned
stands
off
with
susan
bland
then
henry
stops
by
milly
snow
and
john
takes
nellie
jones
hand
while
i
pair
off
with
mandy
biddle
and
scrape
scrape
scrape
goes
the
fiddle
salute
your
partners
comes
the
call
all
join
hands
and
circle
round
grand
train
back
and
balance
all
footsteps
lightly
spurn
the
ground
take
your
lady
and
balance
down
the
middle
to
the
merry
strains
of
the
fiddle
so
the
night
goes
on
and
the
dance
is
and
the
merry
girls
are
homeward
gone
but
i
see
it
all
in
my
sleep
once
more
and
i
dream
till
the
very
break
of
dawn
of
an
impish
dance
on
a
griddle
to
the
screech
and
scrape
of
a
fiddle
the
an
old
worn
harp
that
had
been
played
till
all
its
strings
were
loose
and
frayed
joy
hate
and
fear
each
one
essayed
to
play
but
each
in
turn
had
found
no
sweet
responsiveness
of
sound
then
love
the
came
with
heaving
breast
and
eyes
aflame
the
harp
he
took
all
undismayed
smote
on
its
strings
still
strange
to
song
and
brought
forth
music
sweet
and
strong
the
mystery
i
was
not
now
i
am
a
few
days
hence
i
shall
not
be
i
fain
would
look
before
and
after
but
can
neither
do
some
power
or
lack
of
power
says
no
to
all
i
would
i
stand
upon
a
wide
and
sunless
plain
nor
chart
nor
steel
to
guide
my
steps
aright
fear
i
dare
to
move
i
grope
without
direction
and
by
chance
some
feign
to
hear
a
voice
and
feel
a
hand
that
draws
them
ever
upward
thro
the
gloom
but
i
i
hear
no
voice
and
touch
no
hand
tho
oft
thro
silence
infinite
i
list
and
strain
my
hearing
to
supernal
sounds
tho
oft
thro
fateful
darkness
do
i
reach
and
stretch
my
hand
to
find
that
other
hand
i
question
of
th
eternal
bending
skies
that
seem
to
neighbor
with
the
novice
earth
but
they
roll
on
and
daily
shut
their
eyes
on
me
as
i
one
day
shall
do
on
them
and
tell
me
not
the
secret
that
i
ask
not
they
who
soar
not
they
who
soar
but
they
who
plod
their
rugged
way
unhelped
to
god
are
heroes
they
who
higher
fare
and
flying
fan
the
upper
air
miss
all
the
toil
that
hugs
the
sod
is
they
whose
backs
have
felt
the
rod
whose
feet
have
pressed
the
path
unshod
may
smile
upon
defeated
care
not
they
who
soar
high
up
there
are
no
thorns
to
prod
nor
boulders
lurking
the
clod
to
turn
the
keenness
of
the
share
for
flight
is
ever
free
and
rare
but
heroes
they
the
soil
who
trod
not
they
who
soar
whittier
not
thy
dust
let
there
be
spent
the
gush
of
maudlin
sentiment
such
drift
as
that
is
not
for
thee
whose
life
and
deeds
and
songs
agree
sublime
in
their
simplicity
nor
shall
the
sorrowing
tear
be
shed
o
singer
sweet
thou
art
not
dead
in
spite
of
time
malignant
chill
with
living
fire
thy
songs
shall
thrill
and
men
shall
say
he
liveth
still
great
poets
never
die
for
earth
doth
count
their
lives
of
too
great
worth
to
lose
them
from
her
treasured
store
so
shalt
thou
live
for
evermore
though
far
thy
form
from
mortal
ken
deep
in
the
hearts
and
minds
of
men
two
songs
a
bee
that
was
searching
for
sweets
one
day
through
the
gate
of
a
rose
garden
happened
to
stray
in
the
heart
of
a
rose
he
hid
away
and
forgot
in
his
bliss
the
light
of
day
as
sipping
his
honey
he
buzzed
in
song
though
day
was
waning
he
lingered
long
for
the
rose
was
sweet
so
sweet
a
robin
sits
pluming
his
ruddy
breast
and
a
madrigal
sings
to
his
love
in
her
nest
oh
the
skies
they
are
blue
the
fields
are
green
and
the
birds
in
your
nest
will
soon
be
seen
she
hangs
on
his
words
with
a
thrill
of
love
and
chirps
to
him
as
he
sits
above
for
the
song
is
sweet
so
sweet
a
maiden
was
out
on
a
summer
day
with
the
winds
and
the
waves
and
the
flowers
at
play
and
she
met
with
a
youth
of
gentle
air
with
the
light
of
the
sunshine
on
his
hair
together
they
wandered
the
flowers
among
they
loved
and
loving
they
lingered
long
for
to
love

an
de
pleasures
o
dis

little

up

ef
we
hyeah
some
music
fall
a
real
banjo
like
dat
one
upon
de
wall
longing
if
you
could
sit
with
me
beside
the
sea
and
whisper
with
me
sweetest
dreamings
and
i
think
i
should
not
find
the
clouds
so
dim
and
gray
and
not
so
loud
the
waves
complaining
at
the
shore
if
you
could
sit
with
me
upon
the
shore
and
hold
my
hand
in
yours
as
in
the
days
of
old
i
think
i
should
not
mind
the
chill
baptismal
spray
nor
find
my
hand
and
heart
and
all
the
world
so
cold
if
you
could
walk
with
me
upon
the
strand
and
tell
me
that
my
longing
love
had
won
your
own
i
think
all
my
sad
thoughts
would
then
be
put
away
and
i
could
give
back
laughter
for
the
ocean
moan
the
path
there
are
no
beaten
paths
to
glory
height
there
are
no
rules
to
compass
greatness
known
each
for
himself
must
cleave
a
path
alone
and
press
his
own
way
forward
in
the
fight
smooth
is
the
way
to
ease
and
calm
delight
and
soft
the
road
sloth
chooseth
for
her
own
but
he
who
craves
the
flower
of
life
must
struggle
up
in
all
his
armor
dight
what
though
the
burden
bear
him
sorely
down
and
crush
to
dust
the
mountain
of
his
pride
oh
then
with
strong
heart
let
him
still
abide
for
rugged
is
the
roadway
to
renown
nor
may
he
hope
to
gain
the
envied
crown
till
he
hath
thrust
the
looming
rocks
aside
the
lawyers
ways
i
been
to
them
lawyers
in
the
court
house
up
the
street
an
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
most
completely
beat
fust
one
feller
riz
to
argy
an
he
boldly
waded
in
as
he
dressed
the
tremblin
in
a
coat
o
sin
why
he
painted
him
all
over
in
a
hue
o
blackest
crime
an
he
smeared
his
reputation
with
the
thickest
kind
o
grime
tell
i
found
myself
in
a
misty
way
and
dim
how
the
lord
had
come
to
fashion
sich
an
awful
man
as
him
then
the
other
lawyer
started
an
with
brimmin
tearful
eyes
said
his
client
was
a
martyr
that
was
brought
to
sacrifice
an
he
give
to
that
same
every
blessed
human
grace
tell
i
saw
the
light
o
virtue
fairly
shinin
from
his
face
then
i
own
i
was
puzzled
how
sich
things
could
rightly
be
an
this
aggervatin
question
seems
to
keep
me
so
will
some
one
please
inform
me
an
this
mystery
unroll
how
an
angel
an
a
devil
can
persess
the
soul
ode
for
memorial
day
done
are
the
toils
and
the
wearisome
marches
done
is
the
summons
of
bugle
and
drum
softly
and
sweetly
the
sky
a
land
where
rebellion
is
dumb
dark
were
the
days
of
the
country
derangement
sad
were
the
hours
when
the
conflict
was
on
but
through
the
gloom
of
fraternal
estrangement
god
sent
his
light
and
we
welcome
the
dawn
the
expanse
of
our
mighty
dominions
sweeping
away
to
the
uttermost
parts
peace
the
on
untiring
pinions
bringeth
her
message
of
joy
to
our
hearts
ah
but
this
joy
which
our
minds
can
not
measure
what
did
it
cost
for
our
fathers
to
gain
bought
at
the
price
of
the
heart
dearest
treasure
born
out
of
travail
and
sorrow
and
pain
born
in
the
battle
where
fleet
death
was
flying
slaying
with
bloody
and
fell
born
where
the
heroes
and
martyrs
were
dying
torn
by
the
fury
of
bullet
and
shell
ah
but
the
day
is
past
silent
the
rattle
and
the
confusion
that
followed
the
fight
peace
to
the
heroes
who
died
in
the
battle
martyrs
to
truth
and
the
crowning
of
right
out
of
the
blood
of
a
conflict
fraternal
out
of
the
dust
and
the
dimness
of
death
burst
into
blossoms
of
glory
eternal
flowers
that
sweeten
the
world
with
their
breath
flowers
of
charity
peace
and
devotion
bloom
in
the
hearts
that
are
empty
of
strife
love
that
is
boundless
and
broad
as
the
ocean
leaps
into
beauty
and
fulness
of
life
so
with
the
singing
of
paeans
and
chorals
and
with
the
flag
flashing
high
in
the
sun
place
on
the
graves
of
our
heroes
the
laurels
which
their
unfaltering
valor
has
won
premonition
dear
heart
nay
list
awhile
that
sweet
voice
singing
when
the
world
is
all
so
bright
and
the
sound
of
song
sets
the
heart
oh
love
it
is
not
right
not
then
to
say
dear
heart
the
late
winds
in
the
lake
weeds
shiver
and
the
spray
flies
cold
and
white
and
the
voice
that
sings
gives
a
telltale
quiver
ah
yes
the
world
is
bright
but
dearest
heart
dear
heart
and
do
not
longer
seek
to
hold
me
for
my
soul
is
in
affright
as
the
fearful
glooms
in
their
pall
enfold
me
see
him
who
sang
how
white
and
still
so
dear
dear
heart
thy
hand
i
press
no
more
forever
and
mine
eyes
shall
lose
the
light
for
the
great
white
wraith
by
the
winding
river
shall
check
my
steps
with
might
so
dear
retrospection
when
you
and
i
were
young
the
days
were
filled
with
scent
of
pink
and
rose
and
full
of
joy
from
dawn
till
close
from
morning
mist
till
evening
haze
and
when
the
robin
sung
his
song
the
verdant
woodland
ways
along
we
whistled
louder
than
he
sung
and
school
was
joy
and
work
was
sport
for
which
the
hours
were
all
too
short
when
you
and
i
were
young
my
boy
when
you
and
i
were
young
when
you
and
i
were
young
the
woods
brimmed
bravely
with
every
joy
to
charm
the
boy
the
quail
turned
out
her
timid
broods
the
prickly
copse
a
hostess
fine
held
high
black
cups
of
harmless
wine
and
low
the
laden
swung
with
beads
of
amethyst
where
buzzing
lovers
held
their
tryst
when
you
and
i
were
young
my
boy
when
you
and
i
were
young
when
you
and
i
were
young
the
cool
and
fresh
wind
fanned
our
fevered
brows
when
tumbling
the
scented
mows
or
stripping
by
the
dimpling
pool
about
its
shimmering
face
save
where
we
worn
an
place
how
with
our
shouts
the
calm
banks
rung
how
flashed
the
spray
as
we
plunged
in
pure
gems
that
never
caused
a
sin
when
you
and
i
were
young
my
boy
when
you
and
i
were
young
when
you
and
i
were
young
we
heard
all
sounds
of
nature
with
delight
the
whirr
of
wing
in
sudden
flight
the
chirping
of
the
the
columbine
red
bells
were
rung
the
locust
vested
chorus
sung
while
every
wind
his
zithern
strung
to
high
and
keys
and
played
sonatas
in
the
trees
when
you
and
i
were
young
my
boy
when
you
and
i
were
young
when
you
and
i
were
young
we
knew
to
shout
and
laugh
to
work
and
play
and
night
was
partner
to
the
day
in
all
our
joys
so
swift
time
flew
on
silent
wings
that
ere
we
wist
the
fleeting
years
had
fled
unmissed
and
from
our
hearts
this
cry
was
wrung
to
fill
with
fond
regret
and
tears
the
days
of
our
remaining
years
when
you
and
i
were
young
my
boy
when
you
and
i
were
young
unexpressed
deep
in
my
heart
that
aches
with
the
repression
and
strives
with
plenitude
of
bitter
pain
there
lives
a
thought
that
clamors
for
expression
and
spends
its
undelivered
force
in
vain
what
boots
it
that
some
other
may
have
thought
it
the
right
of
thoughts
expression
is
divine
the
price
of
pain
i
pay
for
it
has
bought
it
i
care
not
who
lays
claim
to
it
is
mine
and
yet
not
mine
until
it
be
delivered
the
manner
of
its
birth
shall
prove
the
test
alas
alas
my
rock
of
pride
is
shivered

is

what

spring

no

the
air
is
sharp
and
cold
the
planter
wends
across
the
wold
and
glad
beneath
the
shining
sky
we
wander
forth
my
love
and
i
and
ever
in
our
hearts
doth
ring
this
song
of
spring
spring
for
life
is
life
and
love
is
love
maid
and
man
or
dove
and
dove
life
may
be
short
life
may
be
long
but
love
will
come
and
to
its
song
shall
this
refrain
for
ever
cling
of
spring
spring
spring
to
louise
oh
the
poets
may
sing
of
their
lady
irenes
and
may
rave
in
their
rhymes
about
wonderful
queens
but
i
throw
my
poetical
wings
to
the
breeze
and
soar
in
a
song
to
my
lady
louise
a
sweet
little
maid
who
is
dearer
i
ween
than
any
fair
duchess
or
even
a
queen
when
speaking
of
her
i
ca
plod
in
my
prose
for
she
the
wee
lassie
who
gave
me
a
rose
since
poets
from
seeing
a
lady
lip
curled
have
written
fair
verse
that
has
sweetened
the
world
why
then
should
not
i
give
the
space
of
an
hour
to
making
a
song
in
return
for
a
flower
i
have
found
in
my
life
it
has
not
been
so
long
there
are
too
few
of
flowers
too
little
of
song
so
out
of
that
blossom
this
lay
of
mine
grows
for
the
dear
little
lady
who
gave
me
the
rose
i
thank
god
for
innocence
dearer
than
art
that
lights
on
a
which
leads
to
the
heart
and
led
by
an
impulse
no
less
than
divine
walks
into
the
temple
and
sits
at
the
shrine
i
would
rather
pluck
daisies
that
grow
in
the
wild
or
take
one
simple
rose
from
the
hand
of
a
child
then
to
breathe
the
rich
fragrance
of
flowers
that
bide
in
the
gardens
of
luxury
passion
and
pride
i
know
not
my
wee
one
how
came
you
to
know
which
way
to
my
heart
was
the
right
way
to
go
unless
in
your
purity
and
clear
god
whispers
his
messages
into
your
ear
you
have
now
had
my
song
let
me
end
with
a
prayer
that
your
life
may
be
always
sweet
happy
and
fair
that
your
joys
may
be
many
and
absent
your
woes
o
dear
little
lady
who
gave
me
the
rose
the
rivals

three
an
thirty
year

stop
the
fun
that
we

sue
some
friend
to
watch
over
her
good
and
grave
but
my
friend
might
fail
in
my
need
he
said
and
i
return
to
find
love
dead
since
friendships
fade
like
the
of
june
i
will
leave
her
in
charge
of
the
stable
moon
then
he
said
to
the
moon
o
dear
old
moon
who
for
years
and
years
from
thy
thrown
above
hast
nurtured
and
guarded
young
lovers
and
love
my
heart
has
but
come
to
its
waiting
june
and
the
promise
time
of
the
budding
vine
oh
guard
thee
well
this
love
of
mine
and
he
harked
him
then
while
all
was
still
and
the
pale
moon
answered
and
said
i
will
and
he
sailed
in
his
ship
many
seas
and
he
wandered
wide
strange
far
strands
in
isles
of
the
south
and
in
orient
lands
where
pestilence
lurks
in
the
breath
of
the
breeze
but
his
star
was
high
so
he
braved
the
main
and
sailed
him
blithely
home
again
and
with
joy
he
bended
his
footsteps
soon
to
learn
of
his
love
from
the
matron
moon
she
sat
as
of
yore
in
her
olden
place
serene
as
death
in
her
silver
chair
a
white
rose
gleamed
in
her
whiter
hair
and
the
tint
of
a
blush
was
on
her
face
at
sight
of
the
youth
she
sadly
bowed
and
hid
her
face
a
gracious
cloud
she
faltered
faint
on
the
night
dim
marge
but
how
spoke
the
youth
have
you
kept
your
charge
the
moon
was
sad
at
a
trust
the
blush
went
out
in
her
blanching
cheek
and
her
voice
was
timid
and
low
and
weak
as
she
made
her
plea
and
sighed
and
wept
oh
another
prayed
and
another
plead
and
i
could
resist
she
answering
said
but
love
still
grows
in
the
hearts
of
men
go
forth
dear
youth
and
love
again
but
he
turned
him
away
from
her
proffered
grace
thou
art
false
o
moon
as
the
hearts
of
men
i
will
not
will
not
love
again
and
he
turned
sheer
with
a
face
to
the
sea
and
cried
sea
curse
the
moon
who
makes
her
vows
and
forgets
so
soon
and
the
awful
sea
with
anger
stirred
and
his
breast
heaved
hard
as
he
lay
and
heard
and
ever
the
moon
wept
down
in
rain
and
ever
her
sighs
rose
high
in
wind
but
the
earth
and
sea
were
deaf
and
blind
and
she
wept
and
sighed
her
griefs
in
vain
and
ever
at
night
when
the
storm
is
fierce
the
cries
of
a
wraith
through
the
thunder
pierce
and
the
waves
strain
their
awful
hands
on
high
to
tear
the
false
moon
from
the
sky
conscience
and
remorse
i
said
to
my
conscience
for
aye
and
aye
and
i
put
her
hands
off
harshly
and
turned
my
face
away
and
conscience
smitten
sorely
returned
not
from
that
day
but
a
time
came
when
my
spirit
grew
weary
of
its
pace
and
i
cried
come
back
my
conscience
i
long
to
see
thy
face
but
conscience
cried
i
can
not
remorse
sits
in
my
place
ione
i
ah
yes
is
sweet
still
to
remember
though
less
painful
to
forget
for
while
my
heart
glows
like
an
ember
mine
eyes
with
sorrow
drops
are
wet
and
oh
my
heart
is
aching
yet
it
is
a
law
of
mortal
pain
that
old
wounds
long
accounted
well
beneath
the
memory
potent
spell
will
wake
to
life
and
bleed
again
so
is
with
me
it
might
be
better
if
i
should
turn
no
look
behind
if
i
could
curb
my
heart
and
fetter
from
reminiscent
gaze
my
mind
or
let
my
soul
go
blind
go
blind
but
would
i
do
it
if
i
could
nay
ease
at
such
a
price
were
spurned
for
since
my
love
was
once
returned
all
that
i
suffer
seemeth
good
i
know
i
know
it
is
the
fashion
when
love
has
left
some
heart
distressed
to
weight
the
air
with
wordful
passion
but
i
am
glad
that
in
my
breast
i
ever
held
so
dear
a
guest
love
does
not
come
at
every
nod
or
every
voice
that
calleth
hasten
he
seeketh
out
some
heart
to
chasten
and
whips
it
wailing
up
to
god
love
is
no
random
road
wayfarer
who
where
he
may
must
sip
his
glass
love
is
the
king
the
whose
guard
recks
not
of
tree
or
grass
to
blaze
the
way
that
he
may
pass
what
if
my
heart
be
in
the
blast
that
heralds
his
triumphant
way
shall
i
repine
shall
i
not
say
rejoice
my
heart
the
king
has
passed
in
life
each
heart
holds
some
sad
story
the
saddest
ones
are
never
told
i
too
have
dreamed
of
fame
and
glory
and
viewed
the
future
bright
with
gold
but
that
is
as
a
tale
long
told
mine
eyes
have
lost
their
youthful
flash
my
cunning
hand
has
lost
its
art
i
am
not
old
but
in
my
heart
the
ember
lies
beneath
the
ash
i
loved
why
not
my
heart
was
youthful
my
mind
was
filled
with
healthy
thought
he
doubts
not
whose
own
self
is
truthful
doubt
by
dishonesty
is
taught
so
loved
i
boldly
fearing
naught
i
did
not
walk
this
lowly
earth
mine
was
a
newer
higher
sphere
where
youth
was
long
and
life
was
dear
and
all
save
love
was
little
worth
her
likeness
would
that
i
might
limn
it
as
love
did
with
enduring
art
nor
dust
of
days
nor
death
may
dim
it
where
it
lies
graven
on
my
heart
of
this
sad
fabric
of
my
life
a
part
i
would
that
i
might
paint
her
now
as
i
beheld
her
in
that
day
ere
her
first
bloom
had
passed
away
and
left
the
lines
upon
her
brow
a
face
serene
that
beaming
brightly
disarmed
the
hot
sun
glances
bold
a
foot
that
kissed
the
ground
so
lightly
he
frowned
in
wrath
and
deemed
her
cold
but
loved
her
still
though
he
was
old
a
form
where
every
maiden
grace
bloomed
to
perfection
richest
flower
the
statued
pose
of
conscious
power
like
dian
of
the
chase
beneath
a
brow
too
fair
for
frowning
like
deeps
that
glass
the
skies
till
all
the
hosts
above
seem
drowning
looked
forth
her
steadfast
hazel
eyes
with
gaze
serene
and
purely
wise
and
over
all
her
tresses
rare
which
when
with
his
desire
grown
weak
the
night
bent
down
to
kiss
her
cheek
entrapped
and
held
him
captive
there
this
was
ione
a
spirit
finer
burned
to
ash
its
house
of
clay
a
soul
instinct
with
fire
diviner
fled
athwart
the
face
of
day
and
tempted
time
with
earthly
stay
her
loveliness
was
not
alone
of
face
and
form
and
tresses
hue
for
aye
a
pure
high
soul
shone
through
her
every
act
this
was
ione
ii
was
in
the
radiant
summer
weather
when
god
looked
smiling
from
the
sky
and
we
went
much
together
by
wood
and
lane
ione
and
i
attracted
by
the
subtle
tie
of
common
thoughts
and
common
tastes
of
eyes
whose
vision
saw
the
same
and
freely
granted
beauty
claim
where
others
found
but
worthless
wastes
we
paused
to
hear
the
far
bells
ringing
across
the
distance
sweet
and
clear
we
listened
to
the
wild
bird
singing
the
song
he
meant
for
his
mate
ear
and
deemed
our
chance
to
do
so
dear
we
loved
to
watch
the
warrior
sun
with
flaming
shield
and
flaunting
crest
go
striding
down
the
gory
west
when
day
long
fight
was
fought
and
won
and
life
became
a
different
story
i
looked
i
saw
new
light
earth
self
assumed
a
greater
glory
mine
eyes
were
cleared
to
fuller
sight
then
first
i
saw
the
need
and
might
of
that
fair
band
the
singing
throng
who
gifted
with
the
skill
divine
take
up
the
threads
of
life
spun
fine
and
weave
them
into
soulful
song
they
sung
for
me
whose
passion
pressing
my
soul
found
vent
in
song
nor
line
they
bore
the
burden
of
expressing
all
that
i
felt
with
art
design
and
every
word
of
theirs
was
mine
i
read
them
to
ione
ofttimes
by
hill
and
shore
beneath
fair
skies
and
she
looked
deeply
in
mine
eyes
and
knew
my
love
spoke
through
their
rhymes
her
life
was
like
the
stream
that
floweth
and
mine
was
like
the
waiting
sea
her
love
was
like
the
flower
that
bloweth
and
mine
was
like
the
searching
bee
i
found
her
sweetness
all
for
me
god
plied
him
in
the
mint
of
time
and
coined
for
us
a
golden
day
and
rolled
it
ringing
down
life
way
with
love
sweet
music
in
its
chime
and
god
unclasped
the
book
of
ages
and
laid
it
open
to
our
sight
upon
the
dimness
of
its
pages
so
long
consigned
to
rayless
night
he
shed
the
glory
of
his
light
we
read
them
well
we
read
them
long
and
ever
thrilling
did
we
see
that
love
ruled
all
humanity
the
master
passion
pure
and
strong
iii
my
skies
are
bare
and
ashen
and
bend
on
me
without
a
beam
since
love
is
held
the
its
loss
must
be
the
pain
supreme
and
grinning
fate
has
wrecked
my
dream
but
pardon
dear
departed
guest
i
will
not
rant
i
will
not
rail
for
good
the
grain
must
feel
the
flail
there
are
whom
love
has
never
blessed
i
had
and
have
a
younger
brother
one
whom
i
loved
and
love
as
never
fond
and
doting
mother
adored
the
babe
who
found
its
way
from
heavenly
scenes
into
her
day
oh
he
was
full
of
youth
new
wine
a
man
on
life
ascending
slope
flushed
with
ambition
full
of
hope
and
every
wish
of
his
was
mine
a
kingly
youth
the
way
before
him
was
thronged
with
victories
to
be
won
so
joyous
too
the
heavens
him
were
bright
with
an
unchanging
sun
his
days
with
rhyme
were
overrun
toil
had
not
taught
him
nature
prose
tears
had
not
dimmed
his
brilliant
eyes
and
sorrow
had
not
made
him
wise
his
life
was
in
the
budding
rose
i
know
not
how
i
came
to
waken
some
instinct
pricked
my
soul
to
sight
my
heart
by
some
vague
thrill
was
shaken
a
thrill
so
true
and
yet
so
slight
i
hardly
deemed
i
read
aright
as
when
a
sleeper
why
not
knowing
what
mysterious
hand
has
called
him
out
of
slumberland
starts
up
to
find
some
danger
nigh
love
is
a
guest
that
comes
unbidden
but
having
come
asserts
his
right
he
will
not
be
repressed
nor
hidden
and
so
my
brother
dawning
plight
became
uncovered
to
my
sight
some
in
his
passing
tone
caught
in
the
meshes
of
my
ear
some
little
glance
a
shade
too
dear
betrayed
the
love
he
bore
ione
what
could
i
do
he
was
my
brother
and
young
and
full
of
hope
and
trust
i
could
not
dared
not
try
to
smother
his
flame
and
turn
his
heart
to
dust
i
knew
how
oft
life
gives
a
crust
to
starving
men
who
cry
for
bread
but
he
was
young
so
few
his
days
he
had
not
learned
the
great
world
ways
nor
disappointment
volumes
read
however
fair
and
rich
the
booty
i
could
not
make
his
loss
my
gain
for
love
is
dear
but
dearer
duty
and
here
my
way
was
clear
and
plain
i
saw
how
i
could
save
him
pain
and
so
with
all
my
day
grown
dim
that
this
loved
brother
sun
might
shine
i
joined
his
suit
gave
over
mine
and
sought
ione
to
plead
for
him
i
found
her
in
an
eastern
bower
where
all
day
long
the
sun
lay
by
to
woo
a
timid
flower
this
day
his
course
was
run
but
still
with
lingering
art
he
spun
gold
fancies
on
the
shadowed
wall
the
vines
waved
soft
and
green
above
and
there
where
one
might
tell
his
love
i
told
my
griefs
i
told
her
all
i
told
her
all
and
as
she
hearkened
a
fell
upon
her
dress
with
grief
her
flushing
brow
was
darkened
one
sob
that
she
could
not
repress
betrayed
the
depths
of
her
distress
upon
her
grief
my
sorrow
fed
and
i
was
bowed
with
unlived
years
my
heart
swelled
with
a
sea
of
tears
the
tears
my
manhood
could
not
shed
the
world
is
rome
and
fate
is
nero
disporting
in
the
hour
of
doom
god
made
us
men
times
make
the
hero
but
in
that
awful
space
of
gloom
i
gave
no
thought
but
sorrow
room
all
all
was
dim
within
that
bower
what
time
the
sun
divorced
the
day
and
all
the
shadows
glooming
gray
proclaimed
the
sadness
of
the
hour
she
could
not
speak
no
word
was
needed
her
look
half
strength
and
half
despair
told
me
i
had
not
vainly
pleaded
that
she
would
not
ignore
my
prayer
and
so
she
turned
and
left
me
there
and
as
she
went
so
passed
my
bliss
she
loved
me
i
could
not
mistake
but
for
her
own
and
my
love
sake
her
womanhood
could
rise
to
this
my
wounded
heart
fled
swift
to
cover
and
life
at
times
seemed
very
drear
my
brother
proved
an
ardent
lover
what
had
so
young
a
man
to
fear
he
wed
ione
within
the
year
no
shadow
clouds
her
tranquil
brow
men
speak
her
husband
name
with
pride
while
she
sits
honored
at
his
side
she
is
she
must
be
happy
now
i
doubt
the
course
i
took
no
longer
since
those
i
love
seem
satisfied
the
bond
between
them
will
grow
stronger
as
they
go
forward
side
by
side
then
will
my
pains
be
jusfied
their
joy
is
mine
and
that
is
best
i
am
not
totally
bereft
for
i
have
still

days
when
the
folks

your
course
down

kiss
the
brow
of
alice

her
gentle
face
you

fashioned
you
like
the
soul
of
alice

wrought
filled
with
gems
of
crystal
thought
after
the
quarrel
so
we
who
supped
the
cup
must
lay
our
friendship
by
your
wrath
has
burned
your
judgment
up
hot
breath
has
blown
the
ashes
high
you
say
that
you
are
wronged
ah
well
i
count
that
friendship
poor
at
best
a
bauble
a
mere
bagatelle
that
can
not
stand
so
slight
a
test
i
fain
would
still
have
been
your
friend
and
talked
and
laughed
and
loved
with
you
but
since
it
must
why
let
it
end
the
false
but
dies
is
not
the
true
so
we
are
favored
you
and
i
who
only
want
the
living
truth
it
was
not
good
to
nurse
the
lie
is
well

died
in
harmless
youth
i
go
from
you
to
sleep
why
what
the
odds
why
should
i
grieve
i
have
no
fund
of
tears
to
weep
for
happenings
that
undeceive
the
days
shall
come
the
days
shall
go
just
as
they
came
and
went
before
the
sun
shall
shine
the
streams
shall
flow
though
you
and
i
are
friends
no
more
and
in
the
volume
of
my
years
where
all
my
thoughts
and
acts
shall
be
the
page
whereon
your
name
appears
shall
be
forever
sealed
to
me
not
that

you
is
less
of
hate
than
love

hands

more
shall
touch
we
go
our
ways
the
world
is
wide
beyond
the
years
i
beyond
the
years
the
answer
lies
beyond
where
brood
the
grieving
skies
and
night
drops
tears
where
faith
smiles
to
rise
and
doff
its
fears
and
carping
sorrow
pines
and
dies
beyond
the
years
ii
beyond
the
years
the
prayer
for
rest
shall
beat
no
more
within
the

her
form
uprears
the
day
that
is
to
come
is
best
beyond
the
years
iii
beyond
the
years
the
soul
shall
find
that
endless
peace
for
which
it
pined
for
light
appears
and
to
the
eyes
that
still
were
blind
with
blood
and
tears
their
sight

on

so
when
they
giv
the
next
word

all
fur

to

i
always

night
of
love
the
moon
has
left
the
sky
love
the
stars
are
hiding
now
and
frowning
on
the
world
love
night
bares
her
sable
brow
the
snow
is
on
the
ground
love
and
cold
and
keen
the
air
is
i
singing
here
to
you
love
you
dreaming
there
in
paris
but
this
is
nature
law
love
though
just
it
may
not
seem
that
men
should
wake
to
sing
love
while
maidens
sleep
and
dream
them
care
may
not
molest
love
nor
stir
them
from
their
slumbers
though
midnight
find
the
swain
love
still
halting
his
numbers
i
watch
the
rosy
dawn
love
come
stealing
up
the
east
while
all
things
round
rejoice
love
that
night
her
reign
has
ceased
the
lark
will
soon
be
heard
love
and
on
his
way
be
winging
when
nature
poets
wake
love
why
should
a
man
be
singing
columbian
ode
i
four
hundred
years
ago
a
tangled
waste
lay
sleeping
on
the
west
atlantic
side
their
devious
ways
the
old
world
millions
traced
content
and
loved
and
labored
dared
and
died
while
students
still
believed
the
charts
they
conned
and
revelled
in
their
thriftless
ignorance
nor
dreamed
of
other
lands
that
lay
beyond
old
ocean
dense
indefinite
expanse
ii
but
deep
within
her
heart
old
nature
knew
that
she
had
once
arrayed
at
earth
behest
another
offspring
fine
and
fair
to
view
the
chosen
suckling
of
the
mother
breast
the
child
was
wrapped
in
vestments
soft
and
fine
each
fold
a
work
of
nature
matchless
art
the
mother
looked
on
it
with
love
divine
and
strained
the
loved
one
closely
to
her
heart
and
there
it
lay
and
with
the
warmth
grew
strong
and
hearty
by
the
salt
sea
breezes
fanned
till
time
with
mellowing
touches
passed
along
and
changed
the
infant
to
a
mighty
land
iii
but
men
knew
naught
of
this
till
there
arose
that
mighty
mariner
the
genoese
who
dared
to
try
in
spite
of
fears
and
foes
the
unknown
fortunes
of
unsounded
seas
o
noblest
of
italia
sons
thy
bark
went
not
alone
into
that
shrouding
night
o
dauntless
darer
of
the
rayless
dark
the
world
sailed
with
thee
to
eternal
light
the
that
with
game
were
crowded
then
are
tilled
and
cultivated
lands
the
schoolhouse
where
bruin
had
his
den
and
where
the
wigwam
stood
the
chapel
stands
the
place
that
nurtured
men
of
savage
mien
now
teems
with
men
of
nature
noblest
types
where
moved
the
banner
green
now
flutters
in
the
breeze
the
stars
and
stripes
a
border
ballad
oh
i
have
got
long
to
live
for
we
all
die
soon
those
who
live
longest
and
the
poorest
and
weakest
are
taking
their
chance
along
with
the
richest
and
strongest
so
it
heigho
for
a
glass
and
a
song
and
a
bright
eye
over
the
table
and
a
dog
for
the
hunt
when
the
game
is
flush
and
the
pick
of
a
gentleman
stable
there
is
dimmock
o
dune
he
was
here
but
he
rotting
on
glen
arragh
was
the
hand
o
macpherson
that
gave
him
the
blow
and
the
vultures
shall
feast
on
his
marrow
but
it
heigho
for
a
brave
old
song
and
a
glass
while
we
are
able
here
a
health
to
death
and
another
cup
to
the
bright
eye
over
the
table
i
can
show
a
broad
back
and
a
jolly
deep
chest
but
who
argues
now
on
appearance
a
blow
or
a
thrust
or
a
stumble
at
best
may
send
me
to
my
clearance
then
it
heigho
for
the
things

love
my
mother
be
soon
wearing
sable
but
give
me
my
horse
and
my
dog
and
my
glass
and
a
bright

the
dilettante
a

type
he
scribbles
some
in

of

it
he

a

sings
a

tragic

he
does
because
his
love
is
strong
but
not
oh
not
for
money
he
studies
almost
everything
from

to

a

a
flowing
spring
demand
and
swift
compliance
he
looms
above
the
sordid
crowd
at
least
through
friendly
lenses
while
his
mamma
looks
pleased
and
proud
and
kindly
pays
expenses
by
the
stream
by
the
stream
i
dream
in
calm
delight
and
watch
as
in
a
glass
how
the
clouds
like
crowds
of
and
maidens
pass
and
the
water
into
ripples
breaks
and
sparkles
as
it
spreads
like
a
host
of
armored
knights
with
silver
helmets
on
their
heads
and
i
deem
the
stream
an
emblem
fit
of
human
life
may
go
for
i
find
a
mind
may
sparkle
much
and
yet
but
shallows
show
and
a
soul
may
glow
with
myriad
lights
and
wondrous
mysteries
when
it
only
lies
a
dormant
thing
and
mirrors
what
it
sees
the
colored
soldiers
if
the
muse
were
mine
to
tempt
it
and
my
feeble
voice
were
strong
if
my
tongue
were
trained
to
measures
i
would
sing
a
stirring
song
i
would
sing
a
song
heroic
of
those
noble
sons
of
ham
of
the
gallant
colored
soldiers
who
fought
for
uncle
sam
in
the
early
days
you
scorned
them
and
with
many
a
flip
and
flout
said
these
battles
are
the
white
man
and
the
whites
will
fight
them
out
up
the
hills
you
fought
and
faltered
in
the
vales
you
strove
and
bled
while
your
ears
still
heard
the
thunder
of
the
foes
advancing
tread
then
distress
fell
on
the
nation
and
the
flag
was
drooping
low
should
the
dust
pollute
your
banner
no
the
nation
shouted
no
so
when
war
in
savage
triumph
spread
abroad
his
funeral
pall
then
you
called
the
colored
soldiers
and
they
answered
to
your
call
and
like
hounds
unleashed
and
eager
for
the
life
blood
of
the
prey
sprung
they
forth
and
bore
them
bravely
in
the
thickest
of
the
fray
and
the
fight
was
hottest
where
the
bullets
fastest
fell
there
they
pressed
unblanched
and
fearless
at
the
very
mouth
of
hell
ah
they
rallied
to
the
standard
to
uphold
it
by
their
might
none
were
stronger
in
the
labors
none
were
braver
in
the
fight
from
the
blazing
breach
of
wagner
to
the
plains
of
olustee
they
were
foremost
in
the
fight
of
the
battles
of
the
free
and
at
pillow
god
have
mercy
on
the
deeds
committed
there
and
the
souls
of
those
poor
victims
sent
to
thee
without
a
prayer
let
the
fulness
of
thy
pity
the
hot
wrought
spirits
sway
of
the
gallant
colored
soldiers
who
fell
fighting
on
that
day
yes
the
blacks
enjoy
their
freedom
and
they
won
it
dearly
too
for
the
life
blood
of
their
thousands
did
the
southern
fields
bedew
in
the
darkness
of
their
bondage
in
the
depths
of
slavery
night
their
muskets
flashed
the
dawning
and
they
fought
their
way
to
light
they
were
comrades
then
and
brothers
are
they
more
or
less
they
were
good
to
stop
a
bullet
and
to
front
the
fearful
fray
they
were
citizens
and
soldiers
when
rebellion
raised
its
head
and
the
traits
that
made
them
worthy
ah
those
virtues
are
not
dead
they
have
shared
your
nightly
vigils
they
have
shared
your
daily
toil
and
their
blood
with
yours
commingling
has
enriched
the
southern
soil
they
have
slept
and
marched
and
suffered
the
same
dark
skies
as
you
they
have
met
as
fierce
a
foeman
and
have
been
as
brave
and
true
and
their
deeds
shall
find
a
record
in
the
registry
of
fame
for
their
blood
has
cleansed
completely
every
blot
of
slavery
shame
so
all
honor
and
all
glory

those
noble
sons

gallant

nature
and
art
to
my
friend
charles
booth
nettleton
i
the
young
queen
nature
ever
sweet
and
fair
once
on
a
time
fell
upon
evil
days
from
hearing
oft
herself
discussed
with
praise
there
grew
within
her
heart
the
longing
rare
to
see
herself
and
every
passing
air
the
warm
desire
fanned
into
lusty
blaze
full
oft
she
sought
this
end
by
devious
ways
but
sought
in
vain
so
fell
she
in
despair
for
none
within
her
train
nor
by
her
side
could
solve
the
task
or
give
the
envied
boon
so
day
and
night
beneath
the
sun
and
moon
she
wandered
to
and
fro
unsatisfied
till
art
came
by
a
blithe
inventive
elf
and
made
a
glass
wherein
she
saw
herself
ii
enrapt
the
queen
gazed
on
her
glorious
self
then
trembling
with
the
thrill
of
sudden
thought
commanded
that
the
skilful
wight
be
brought
that
she
might
dower
him
with
lands
and
pelf
then
out
upon
the
silent
shelf
and
up
the
hills
and
on
the
downs
they
sought
him
who
so
well
and
wondrously
had
wrought
and
with
much
search
found
and
brought
home
the
elf
but
he
put
by
all
gifts
with
sad
replies
and
from
his
lips
these
words
flowed
forth
like
wine
o
queen
i
want
no
gift
but
thee
he
said
she
heard
and
looked
on
him
with
eyes
gave
him
her
hand
low
murmuring
i
am
thine
and
at
the
morrow
dawning
they
were
after
while
a
poem
of
faith
i
think
that
though
the
clouds
be
dark
that
though
the
waves
dash
the
bark
yet
after
while
the
light
will
come
and
in
calm
waters
safe
at
home
the
bark
will
anchor
weep
not
my
maid
because
your
fairest
blossoms
fade
that
sorrow
still
your
cup
and
even
though
you
root
them
up
the
weeds
grow
ranker
for
after
while
your
tears
shall
cease
and
sorrow
shall
give
way
to
peace
the
flowers
shall
bloom
the
weeds
shall
die
and
in
that
faith
seen
by
and
by
thy
woes
shall
perish
smile
at
old
fortune
adverse
tide
smile
when
the
scoffers
sneer
and
chide
oh
not
for
you
the
gems
that
pale
and
not
for
you
the
flowers
that
fail
let
this
thought
cherish
that
after
while
the
clouds
will
part
and
then
with
joy
the
waiting
heart
shall
feel
the
light
come
stealing
in
that
drives
away
the
cloud
of
sin
and
breaks
its
power
and
you
shall
burst
your
chrysalis
and
wing
away
to
realms
of
bliss
untrammelled
pure
divinely
free
above
all
earth
anxiety
from
that
same
hour
the
ol
tunes
you
kin
talk
about
yer
anthems
an
yer
arias
an
sich
an
yer
modern
that
you
think
so
awful
rich
but
you
orter
heerd
us
youngsters
in
the
times
now
far
away
o
the
ol
tunes
in
the
way
there
was
some
of
us
sung
treble
an
a
few
of
us
growled
bass
an
the
tide
o
song
flowed
smoothly
with
its
o
grace
there
was
spirit
in
that
music
an
a
kind
o
solemn
sway
o
the
ol
tunes
in
the
way
i
remember
oft
o
in
my
homespun
pantaloons
on
my
face
the
bronze
an
freckles
o
the
suns
o
youthful
junes
thinkin
that
no
mortal
minstrel
ever
chanted
sich
a
lay
as
the
ol
tunes
we
was
in
the
way
the
boys
always
lead
us
an
the
girls
all
chime
in
till
the
sweetness
o
the
robbed
the
soul
o
sin
an
i
used
to
tell
the
parson
was
as
good
to
sing
as
pray
when
the
people
sung
the
ol
tunes
in
the
way
how
i
long
to
hear
pourin
forth
from
soul
to
soul
with
the
treble
high
an
meller
an
the
bass
mighty
roll
but
the
times
is
very
an
the
music
heerd
ai
the
singin
o
the
ol
tunes
in
the
way
little
screechin
by
a
woman
little
squawkin
by
a
man
then
the
organ
jest
the
empty
space
to
span
an
ef
you
should
even
think
it
is
proper
fur
to
say
that
you
want
to
hear
the
ol
tunes
in
the
way
but
i
think
that
some
bright
mornin
when
the
toils
of
life
air
an
the
sun
o
heaven
glads
with
light
the
happy
shore
i
shall
hear
the
angel
chorus
in
the
realms
of
endless
day
o
the
ol
tunes
in
the
way
melancholia
silently
without
my
window
tapping
gently
at
the
pane
falls
the
rain
through
the
trees
sighs
the
breeze
like
a
soul
in
pain
here
alone
i
sit
and
weep
thought
hath
banished
sleep
wearily
i
sit
and
listen
to
the
water
ceaseless
drip
to
my
lip
fate
turns
up
the
bitter
cup
forcing
me
to
sip
is
a
bitter
bitter
drink
thus
i
sit
and
think
thinking
things
unknown
and
awful
thoughts
on
wild
uncanny
themes
waking
dreams
spectres
dark
corpses
stark
show
the
gaping
seams
whence
the
cold
and
cruel
knife
stole
away
their
life
bloodshot
eyes
all
strained
and
staring
gazing
ghastly
into
mine
blood
like
wine
on
the
brow
clotted
now
shows
death
dreadful
sign
lonely
vigil
still
i
keep
would
that
i
might
sleep
still
oh
still
my
brain
is
whirling
still
runs
on
my
stream
of
thought
i
am
caught
in
the
net
fate
hath
set
mind
and
soul
are
brought
to
destruction
very
brink
yet
i
can
but
think
eyes
that
look
into
the
future
peeping
forth
from
out
my
mind
they
will
find
some
new
weight
soon
or
late
on
my
soul
to
bind
crushing
all
its
courage
out
heavier
than
doubt
dawn
the
eastern
monarch
daughter
rising
from
her
dewy
bed
lays
her
head
the
clouds
sombre
shrouds
now
half
fringed
with
red
the
land
she
to
peep
come
o
gentle
sleep
hark
the
morning
cock
is
crowing
dreams
like
ghosts
must
hie
away
is
the
day
rosy
morn
now
is
born
dark
thoughts
may
not
stay
day
my
brain
from
foes
will
keep
now
my
soul
i
sleep
the
wooing
a
youth
went
faring
up
and
down
alack
and
he
fared
him
to
the
market
town
alack
and
and
there
he
met
a
maiden
fair
with
hazel
eyes
and
auburn
hair
his
heart
went
from
him
then
and
there
alack
and
she
posies
sold
right
merrily
alack
and
but
not
a
flower
was
fair
as
she
alack
and
he
bought
a
rose
and
sighed
a
sigh
ah
dearest
maiden
would
that
i
might
dare
the
seller
too
to
buy
alack
and
she
tossed
her
head
the
coy
coquette
alack
and
i
not
sir
in
the
market
yet
alack
and
your
love
must
cool
upon
a
shelf
tho
much
i
sell
for
gold
and
pelf
i
yet
too
young
to
sell
myself
alack
and
the
youth
was
filled
with
sorrow
sore
alack
and
and
looked
he
at
the
maid
once
more
alack
and
then
loud
he
cried
fair
maiden
if
too
young
to
sell
now
as
i
live
you
not
too
young
yourself
to
give
alack
and
the
little
maid
cast
down
her
eyes
alack
and
and
many
a
flush
began
to
rise
alack
and
why
since
you
are
so
bold
she
said
i
doubt
not
you
are
highly
bred
so
take
me
and
the
twain
were
wed
alack
and
merry
autumn
it
all
a
farce
these
tales
they
tell
about
the
breezes
sighing
and
moans
astir
field
and
dell
because
the
year
is
dying
such
principles
are
most
absurd
i
care
not
who
first
taught
there
nothing
known
to
beast
or
bird
to
make
a
solemn
autumn
in
solemn
times
when
grief
holds
sway
with
countenance
distressing
you
note
the
more
of
black
and
gray
will
then
be
used
in
dressing
now
purple
tints
are
all
around
the
sky
is
blue
and
mellow
and
the
grasses
turn
the
ground
from
modest
green
to
yellow
the
seed
burrs
all
with
laughter
crack
on
featherweed
and
jimson
and
leaves
that
should
be
dressed
in
black
are
all
decked
out
in
crimson
a
butterfly
goes
winging
by
a
singing
bird
comes
after
and
nature
all
from
earth
to
sky
is
bubbling
with
laughter
the
ripples
wimple
on
the
rills
like
sparkling
little
lasses
the
sunlight
runs
along
the
hills
and
laughs
among
the
grasses
the
earth
is
just
so
full
of
fun
it
really
ca
contain
it
and
streams
of
mirth
so
freely
run
the
heavens
seem
to
rain
it
do
talk
to
me
of
solemn
days
in
autumn
time
of
splendor
because
the
sun
shows
fewer
rays
and
these
grow
slant
and
slender
why
it
the
climax
of
the
year
the
highest
time
of
living
till
naturally
its
bursting
cheer
just
melts
into
thanksgiving

and
oh
the

sadly
down
the

doth
make
the

along

the

sleeps
not
sleeps

wakes
to
greater
deeps
of
wisdom
glory
truth
and
light
than
ever
blessed
her
seeking
sight
in
this
low
long
lethargic
night
worn
out
with
strife
which
men
call
life
the
change
has
come
and
who
would
say
i
would
it
were
not
come
what
were
the
respite
till
postponement
of
a
certain
sorrow
from
which
each
passing
day
would
borrow
let
grief
be
dumb
the
change
has
come
comparison
the
sky
of
brightest
gray
seems
dark
to
one
whose
sky
was
ever
white
to
one
who
never
knew
a
spark
thro
all
his
life
of
love
or
light
the
grayest
cloud
seems
the
robin
sounds
a
beggar
note
where
one
the
nightingale
has
heard
but
he
for
whom
no
silver
throat
its
liquid
music
ever
stirred
deems
robin
still
the
sweetest
bird
a
on
the
wide
veranda
white
in
the
purple
failing
light
sits
the
master
while
the
sun
is
lowly
burning
and
his
dreamy
thoughts
are
drowned
in
the
softly
flowing
sound
of
the
of
the
slow
returning

the
halting
steps
be

slow
and
weary
still
the
spirits
brave

a

in

the

full
and

of
the
mellow

music
growing
clearer
as
the
toilers
raise
the
hymn
thro

disappointed
an
old
man
planted
and
dug
and
tended
toiling
in
joy
from
dew
to
dew
the
sun
was
kind
and
the
rain
befriended
fine
grew
his
orchard
and
fair
to
view
then
he
said
i
will
quiet
my
thrifty
fears
for
here

fruit
for
my
failing
years
but
even
then
the
gathered
swallowing
up
the
azure
sky
the
sweeping
winds
into
white
foam
lathered
the
placid
breast
of
the
bay
hard
by
then
the
spirits
that
raged
in
the
darkened
air
swept
his
orchard
and
left
it
bare
the
old
man
stood
in
the
rain
uncaring
viewing
the
place
the
storm
had
swept
and
then
with
a
cry
from
his
soul
despairing
he
bowed
him
down
to
the
earth
and
wept
but
a
voice
cried
aloud
from
the
driving
rain
arise
old
man
and
plant
again

oh

sweet

with
its
mingling
of
care
though
joy
travels
only
a
step
before
pain

roused
from
thy
slumbers
and

my

unto
thee
oh

thou

turn
thine
ear
to
my
pleading
and
hearken
to
me
october
october
is
the
treasurer
of
the
year
and
all
the
months
pay
bounty
to
her
store
the
fields
and
orchards
still
their
tribute
bear
and
fill
her
brimming
coffers
more
and
more
but
she
with
youthful
lavishness
spends
all
her
wealth
in
gaudy
dress
and
decks
herself
in
garments
bold
of
scarlet
purple
red
and
gold
she
heedeth
not
how
swift
the
hours
fly
but
smiles
and
sings
her
happy
life
along
she
only
sees
above
a
shining
sky
she
only
hears
the
breezes
voice
in
song
her
garments
trail
the
woodlands
through
and
gather
pearls
of
early
dew
that
sparkle
till
the
roguish
sun
creeps
up
and
steals
them
every
one
but
what
cares
she
that
jewels
should
be
lost
when
all
of
nature
bounteous
wealth
is
hers
though
princely
fortunes
may
have
been
their
cost
not
one
regret
her
calm
demeanor
stirs
happy
careless
free
she
lives
her
life
out
joyously
nor
cares
when
frost
stalks
her
way
and
turns
her
auburn
locks
to
gray
a
summer
night
the
night
is
dewy
as
a
maiden
mouth
the
skies
are
bright
as
are
a
maiden
eyes
soft
as
a
maiden
breath
the
wind
that
flies
up
from
the
perfumed
bosom
of
the
south
like
sentinels
the
pines
stand
in
the
park
and
hither
hastening
like
rakes
that
roam
with
lamps
to
light
their
wayward
footsteps
home
the
fireflies
come
down
the
dark
ships
that
pass
in
the
night
out
in
the
sky
the
great
dark
clouds
are
massing
i
look
far
out
into
the
pregnant
night
where
i
can
hear
a
solemn
booming
gun
and
catch
the
gleaming
of
a
random
light
that
tells
me
that
the
ship
i
seek
is
passing
passing
my
tearful
eyes
my
soul
deep
hurt
are
glassing
for
i
would
hail
and
check
that
ship
of
ships
i
stretch
my
hands
imploring
cry
aloud
my
voice
falls
dead
a
foot
from
mine
own
lips
and
but
its
ghost
doth
reach
that
vessel
passing
passing
o
earth
o
sky
o
ocean
both
surpassing
o
heart
of
mine
o
soul
that
dreads
the
dark
is
there
no
hope
for
me
is
there
no
way
that
i
may
sight
and
check
that
speeding
bark
which
out
of
sight
and
sound
is
passing

dawn
an
angel
robed
in
spotless
white
bent
down
and
kissed
the
sleeping
night
night
woke
to
blush
the
sprite
was
gone
men
saw
the
blush
and
called
it
dawn
a
drowsy
day
the
air
is
dark
the
sky
is
gray
the
misty
shadows
come
and
go
and
here
within
my
dusky
room
each
chair
looks
ghostly
in
the
gloom
outside
the
rain
falls
cold
and
slow
drops
spray
each
slightest
sound
is
magnified
for
drowsy
quiet
holds
her
reign
the
burnt
stick
in
the
fireplace
breaks
the
nodding
cat
with
start
awakes
and
then
to
sleep
drops
off
again
unheeding
towser
at
her
side
i
look
far
out
across
the
lawn
where
huddled
stand
the
silly
sheep
my
work
lies
idle
at
my
hands
my
thoughts
fly
out
like
scattered
strands
of
thread
and
on
the
verge
of
sleep
still
half
awake
i
dream
and
yawn
what
spirits
rise
before
my
eyes
how
various
of
kind
and
form
sweet
memories
of
days
long
past
the
dreams
of
youth
that
could
not
last
each
smiling
calm
each
raging
storm
that
swept
across
my
early
skies
half
seen
the
bare
boughs
before
my
window
sweep
and
sway
and
chafe
in
tortures
of
unrest
my
chin
sinks
down
upon
my
breast
i
can
not
work
on
such
a
day
but
only
sit
and
dream
and
drowse
dirge
place
this
bunch
of
mignonette
in
her
cold
dead
hand
when
the
golden
sun
is
set
where
the
poplars
stand
bury
her
from
sun
and
day
lay
my
little
love
away
from
my
sight
she
was
like
a
modest
flower
blown
in
sunny
june
warm
as
sun
at
noon
high
hour
chaster
than
the
moon
ah
her
day
was
brief
and
bright
earth
has
lost
a
star
of
light
she
is
dead
softly
breathe
her
name
to
me
ah
i
loved
her
so
gentle
let
your
tribute
be
none
may
better
know
her
true
worth
than
i
who
weep
her
as
she
lies
asleep
soft
asleep
lay
these
lilies
on
her
breast
they
are
not
more
white
than
the
soul
of
her
at
rest
their
petals
bright
chant
your
aves
soft
and
low
solemn
be
your
tread
and
slow
she
is
dead
lay
her
here
beneath
the
grass
cool
and
green
and
sweet
where
the
gentle
brook
may
pass
crooning
at
her
feet
nature
bards
shall
come
and
sing
and
the
fairest
flowers
shall
spring
where
she
lies
safe
above
the
water
swirl
she
has
crossed
the
bar
earth
has
lost
a
precious
pearl
heaven
has
gained
a
star
that
shall
ever
sing
and
shine
till
it
quells
this
grief
of
mine
for
my
love
hymn
when
storms
arise
and
skies
about
me
lower
to
thee
o
lord
i
raise
mine
eyes
to
thee
my
tortured
spirit
flies
for
solace
in
that
hour
the
mighty
arm
will
let
no
harm
come
near
me
nor
befall
me
thy
voice
shall
quiet
my
alarm
when
life
great
battle
waxeth
warm
no
foeman
shall
appall
me
upon
thy
breast
secure
i
rest
from
sorrow
and
vexation
no
more
by
sinful
cares
oppressed
but
in
thy
presence
ever
blest
o
god
of
my
salvation
preparation
the
little
bird
sits
in
the
nest
and
sings
a
shy
soft
song
to
the
morning
light
and
it
flutters
a
little
and
prunes
its
wings
the
song
is
halting
and
poor
and
brief
and
the
fluttering
wings
scarce
stir
a
leaf
but
the
note
is
a
prelude
to
sweeter
things
and
the
busy
bill
and
the
flutter
slight
are
proving
the
wings
for
a
bolder
flight
the
deserted

calls
me
to
my
in

the
secret
what
says
the
wind
to
the
waving
trees
what
says
the
wave
to
the
river
what
means
the
sigh
in
the
passing
breeze
why
do
the
rushes
quiver
have
you
not
heard
the
fainting
cry
of
the
flowers
that
said
list
how
the
gray
dove
moans
and
grieves
under
the
woodland
cover
list
to
the
drift
of
the
falling
leaves
list
to
the
wail
of
the
lover
have
you

the
message
heard
already
by
wave
and
breeze
and
bird
come
come
away
to
the
river
bank
come
in
the
early
morning
come
when
the
grass
with
dew
is
dank
there
you
will
find
the
warning
a
hint
in
the
kiss
of
the
quickening
air
of
the
secret
that
birds
and
breezes
bear
the
wind
and
the
sea
i
stood
by
the
shore
at
the
death
of
day
as
the
sun
sank
flaming
red
and
the
face
of
the
waters
that
spread
away
was
as
gray
as
the
face
of
the
dead
and
i
heard
the
cry
of
the
wanton
sea
and
the
moan
of
the
wailing
wind
for
love
sweet
pain
in
his
heart
had
he
but
the
gray
old
sea
had
sinned
the
wind
was
young
and
the
sea
was
old
but
their
cries
went
up
together
the
wind
was
warm
and
the
sea
was
cold
for
age
makes
wintry
weather
so
they
cried
aloud
and
they
wept
amain
till
the
sky
grew
dark
to
hear
it
and
out
of
its
folds
crept
the
misty
rain
in
its
shroud
like
a
troubled
spirit
for
the
wind
was
wild
with
a
hopeless
love
and
the
sea
was
sad
at
heart
at
many
a
crime
that
he
wot
of
wherein
he
had
played
his
part
he
thought
of
the
gallant
ships
gone
down
by
the
will
of
his
wicked
waves
and
he
thought
how
the
in
the
town
held
the
widows
graves
the
wild
wind
thought
of
the
love
he
had
left
afar
in
an
eastern
land
and
he
longed
as
long
the
much
bereft
for
the
touch
of
her
perfumed
hand
in
his
winding
wail
and
his
sigh
his
aching
grief
found
vent
while
the
sea
looked
up
at
the
bending
sky
and
murmured
i
repent
but
as
he
spoke
a
ship
came
by
that
bravely
ploughed
the
main
and
a
light
came
into
the
sea
green
eye
and
his
heart
grew
hard
again
then
he
spoke
to
the
wind
friend
seest
thou
not
yon
vessel
is
eastward
bound
pray
speed
with
it
to
the
happy
spot
where
thy
loved
one
may
be
found
and
the
wind
rose
up
in
a
dear
delight
and
after
the
good
ship
sped
but
the
crafty
sea
by
his
wicked
might
kept
the
vessel
ever
ahead
till
the
wind
grew
fierce
in
his
despair
and
white
on
the
brow
and
lip
he
tore
his
garments
and
tore
his
hair
and
fell
on
the
flying
ship
and
the
ship
went
down
for
a
rock
was
there
and
the
sailless
sea
loomed
black
while
burdened
again
with
dole
and
care
the
wind
came
moaning
back
and
still
he
moans
from
his
bosom
hot
where
his
raging
grief
lies
pent
and
ever
when
the
ships
come
not
the
sea
says
i
repent
riding
to
town
when
labor
is
light
and
the
morning
is
fair
i
find
it
a
pleasure
beyond
all
compare
to
hitch
up
my
nag
and
go
hurrying
down
and
take
katie
may
for
a
ride
into
town
for
goes
the
wagon
but
our
lay
there
joy
in
a
song
as
we
rattle
along
in
the
light
of
the
glorious
day
a
coach
would
be
fine
but
a
spring
wagon
good
my
jeans
are
a
match
for
kate
gingham
and
hood
the
hills
take
us
up
and
the
vales
take
us
down
but
what
matters
that
we
are
riding
to
town
and
goes
the
wagon
but
sing
we
there
never
a
care
may
live
in
the
air
that
is
filled
with
the
breath
of
our
glee
and
after
we
started
there
naught
can
repress
the
thrill
of
our
hearts
in
their
wild
happiness
the
heavens
may
smile
or
the
heavens
may
frown
and
it
all
one
to
us
when
we
riding
to
town
for
goes
the
wagon
but
we
shout
for
our
hearts
they
are
clear
and
there
nothing
to
fear
and
we
never
a
pain
nor
a
doubt
the
wagon
is
weak
and
the
roadway
is
rough
and
tho
it
is
long
it
is
not
long
enough
for
mid
all
my
ecstasies
this
is
the
crown
to
sit
beside
katie
and
ride
into
town
when
goes
the
wagon
but
our
song
and
if
i
had
my
way
i
be
willing
to
pay
if
the
road
could
be
made
twice
as
long
we
wear
the
mask
we
wear
the
mask
that
grins
and
lies
it
hides
our
cheeks
and
shades
our
eyes
this
debt
we
pay
to
human
guile
with
torn
and
bleeding
hearts
we
smile
and
mouth
with
myriad
subtleties
why
should
the
world
be
in
counting
all
our
tears
and
sighs
nay
let
them
only
see
us
while
we
wear
the
mask
we
smile
but
o
great
christ
our
cries
to
thee
from
tortured
souls
arise
we
sing
but
oh
the
clay
is
vile
beneath
our
feet
and
long
the
mile
but
let
the
world
dream
otherwise
we
wear
the
mask
the
meadow
lark
though
the
winds
be
dank
and
the
sky
be
sober
and
the
grieving
day
in
a
mantle
gray
hath
let
her
waiting
maiden
robe
her
all
the
fields
along
i
can
hear
the
song
of
the
meadow
lark
as
she
flits
and
flutters
and
laughs
at
the
thunder
when
it
mutters
o
happy
bird
of
heart
most
gay
to
sing
when
skies
are
gray
when
the
clouds
are
full
and
the
tempest
master
lets
the
loud
winds
sweep
from
his
bosom
deep
like
heralds
of
some
dire
disaster
then
the
heart
alone
to
itself
makes
moan
and
the
songs
come
slow
while
the
tears
fall
fleeter
and
silence
than
song
by
far
seems
sweeter
oh
few
are
they
along
the
way
who
sing
when
skies
are
gray
one
life
oh
i
am
hurt
to
death
my
love
the
shafts
of
fate
have
pierced
my
striving
heart
and
i
am
sick
and
weary
of
the
endless
pain
and
smart
my
soul
is
weary
of
the
strife
and
chafes
at
life
and
chafes
at
life
time
mocks
me
with
fair
promises
a
blooming
future
grows
a
barren
past
like
rain
my
fair
trees
unburden
in
the
blast
the
harvest
fails
on
grain
and
tree
nor
comes
to
me
nor
comes
to
me
the
stream
that
bears
my
hopes
abreast
turns
ever
from
my
way
its
pregnant
tide
my
laden
boat
torn
from
its
rest
drifts
to
the
other
side
so
all
my
hopes
are
set
astray
and
drift
away
and
drift
away
the
lark
sings
to
me
at
the
morn
and
near
me
wings
her
flight
but
pleasure
dies
as
soon
as
born
the
owl
takes
up
the
night
and
night
seems
long
and
doubly
dark
i
miss
the
lark
i
miss
the
lark
let
others
labor
as
they
may
i
sing
and
sigh
alone
and
write
my
line
their
fate
is
theirs
or
grave
or
gay
and
mine
shall
still
be
mine
i
know
the
world
holds
joy
and
glee
but
not
for
me
is
not
for
me
changing
time
the
cloud
looked
in
at
the
window
and
said
to
the
day
be
dark
and
the
roguish
rain
tapped
hard
on
the
pane
to
stifle
the
song
of
the
lark
the
wind
sprang
up
in
the
tree
tops
and
shrieked
with
a
voice
of
death
but
the
breeze
that
shook
the
trees
was
touched
with
a
violet
breath
dead
a
knock
is
at
her
door
but
she
is
weak
strange
dews
have
washed
the
paint
streaks
from
her
cheek
she
does
not
rise
but
ah
this
friend
is
known
and
knows
that
he
will
find
her
all
alone
so
opens
he
the
door
and
with
soft
tread
goes
straightway
to
the
richly
curtained
bed
his
soft
hand
on
her
dewy
head
he
lays
a
strange
white
light
she
gives
him
for
his
gaze
then
looking
on
the
glory
of
her
charms
he
crushes
her
resistless
in
his
arms
stand
back
look
not
upon
this
bold
embrace
nor
view
the
calmness
of
the
wanton
face
with
joy
unspeakable
and
breath
she
keeps
her
last
long
liaison
with
death

creaking
what
if
the
arrows
of
the
rain
do
beat
against
the
art
thou

strong
and
fast
against

safe
and
well
against

flood
insistent
swell
what
boots
it
that
thou
alone
and
laughest
in
the
battle
face
when
all
the
weak
have
fled
the
place
and
let
their
feet
and
fears
keep
pace
thou
wavest
still
thine
ensign
high
and
shoutest
thy
loud
higher
than
the
tempest
roared
it
cleaves
the
silence
like
a
sword
right
arms
and
armors
too
that
man
who
will
not
compromise
with
wrong
though
single
he
must
front
the
throng
and
wage
the
battle
hard
and
long
minorities
since
time
began
have
shown
the
better
side
of
man
and
often
in
the
lists
of
time
one
man
has
made
a
cause
sublime
if
if
life
were
but
a
dream
my
love
and
death
the
waking
time
if
day
had
not
a
beam
my
love
and
night
had
not
a
rhyme
a
barren
barren
world
were
this
without
one
saving
gleam
i
only
ask
that
with
a
kiss
you
wake
me
from
the
dream
if
dreaming
were
the
sum
of
days
and
loving
were
the
bane
if
battling
for
a
wreath
of
bays
could
soothe
a
heart
in
pain
i
scorn
the
meed
of
battle
might
all
other
aims
above
i
choose
the
human
higher
right
to
suffer
and
to
love
the
song
my
soul
lost
in
the
music
mist
roamed
rapt
skies
of
amethyst
the
cheerless
streets
grew
summer
meads
the
son
of
phoebus
spurred
his
steeds
and
down
the
mazy
tune
december
lost
its
way
in
june
while
from
a
verdant
vale
i
heard
the
piping
of
a
bird
a
something
in
the
tender
strain
revived
an
old
pain
and
as
in
depths
of
many
seas
my
heart
was
drowned
in
memories
the
tears
came
welling
to
my
eyes
nor
could
i
ask
it
otherwise
for
oh
a
sweetness
seems
to
last
amid
the
dregs
of
sorrows
past
it
stirred
a
chord
that
here
of
late
i
grown
to
think
could
not
vibrate
it
brought
me
back
the
trust
of
youth
the
world
again
was
joy
and
truth
and
avice
blooming
like
a
bride
once
more
stood
trusting
at
my
side
but
still
with
bosom
desolate
the
lorn
bird
sang
to
find
his
mate
then
there
are
trees
and
lights
and
stars
the
tinkle
of
guitars
and
throbs
again
as
throbbed
that
waltz
before
i
knew
that
hearts
were
false
then
like
a
cold
wave
on
a
shore
comes
silence
and
she
sings
no
more
i
wake
i
breathe
i
think
again
and
walk
the
sordid
ways
of
men

why
fades
a
dream
why
fades
a
dream
an
iridescent
ray
flecked
in
between
the
tryst
of
night
and
day
why
fades
a
dream
of
consciousness
the
shade
wrought
out
by
lack
of
light
and
made
upon
life
stream
why
fades
a
dream
that
thought
may
thrive
so
fades
the
fleshless
dream
lest
men
should
learn
to
trust
the
things
that
seem
so
fades
a
dream
that
living
thought
may
grow
and
like
a
waxing
glow
upon
life
stream
so
fades
a
dream
the
sparrow
a
little
bird
with
plumage
brown
beside
my
window
flutters
down
a
moment
chirps
its
little
strain
ten
taps
upon
my
and
chirps
again
and
hops
along
to
call
my
notice
to
its
song
but
i
work
on
nor
heed
its
lay
till
in
neglect
it
flies
away
so
birds
of
peace
and
hope
and
love
come
fluttering
earthward
from
above
to
settle
on
life
and
ease
our
load
of
earthly
ills
but
we
in
traffic
rush
and
din
too
deep
engaged
to
let
them
in
with
deadened
heart
and
sense
plod
on
nor
know
our
loss
till
they
are
gone
speakin
o
christmas
breezes
blowin
middlin
brisk
thro
the
air
fallin
kind
o
soft
an
light
not
enough
to
make
things
white
but
jest
sorter
siftin
down
so
to
cover
up
the
brown
of
the
dark
world
rugged
ways
make
things
look
like
holidays
not
smoothed
over
but
jest
specked
sorter
strainin
fur
effect
an
not
quite
through
what
it
started
in
to
do
mercy
sakes
it
does
seem
queer
christmas
day
is
nigh
here
somehow
it
do
seem
to
me
christmas
like
it
used
to
be
christmas
with
its
ice
an
snow
christmas
of
the
long
ago
you
could
feel
its
stir
an
hum
weeks
an
weeks
before
it
come
somethin
in
the
atmosphere
told
you
when
the
day
was
near
did
need
no
almanacs
that
was
one
o
nature
fac
every
cottage
decked
out
gay
cedar
wreaths
an
holly
spray
an
the
stores
how
they
were
drest
tinsel

winder
fixed
up

candy
canes
an
things
like
that
noah
arks
an
guns
an
dolls
an
all
kinds
o
then
with
frosty
bells
slidin
down
the
hills
o
time
right
amidst
the
fun
an
din
christmas

in
raised
his
cheery
voice
to
call
out
a
welcome
to
us
all

and
hearty
strong
an
bluff

feastin
high
an
some
courtin
on

sly
bustin
in

more
what

durn
fur

me
in
their
keerless
sort
o

clear
when

purty
blue
sence
mother
gone
to

growin
gray
hello
ole
man
you
gray
an
it
beats
ole
ned
to
see
the
way
the
crow
feet
aroun
yore
eyes
tho
it
ought
to
cause
me
no
fur
there
many
a
sun
you
seen
rise
an
many
a
one
you
seen
go
down
sence
yore
step
was
light
an
yore
hair
was
brown
an
storms
an
snows
have
had
their
way
hello
ole
man
you
gray
hello
ole
man
you
gray
an
the
youthful
pranks
you
used
to
play
are
dreams
of
a
far
past
long
ago
that
lie
in
a
heart
where
the
fires
burn
low
that
has
lost
the
flame
though
it
kept
the
glow
an
spite
of
drivin
snow
an
storm
beats
bravely
on
forever
warm
december
holds
the
place
of
may
hello
ole
man
you
gray
hello
ole
man
you
gray
who
cares
what
the
carpin
youngsters
say
for
after
all
when
the
tale
is
told
love
proves
if
a
man
is
young
or
old
old
age
ca
make
the
heart
grow
cold
when
it
does
the
will
of
an
honest
mind
when
it
beats
with
love
fur
all
mankind
then
the
night
but
leads
to
a
fairer
day
hello
ole
man
you
gray
to
the
memory
of
mary
young
god
has
his
plans
and
what
if
we
with
our
sight
be
too
blind
to
see
their
full
fruition
can
not
he
who
made
it
solve
the
mystery
one
whom
we
loved
has
asleep
not
died
although
her
calm
be
deep
some
new
unknown
and
strange
surprise
in
heaven
holds
enrapt
her
eyes
and
can
you
blame
her
that
her
gaze
is
turned
away
from
earthly
ways
when
to
her
eyes
god
light
and
love
have
the
view
of
things
above
a
gentle
spirit
sweetly
good
the
pearl
of
precious
womanhood
who
heard
the
voice
of
duty
clear
and
found
her
mission
soon
and
near
she
loved
all
nature
flowers
fair
the
warmth
of
sun
the
kiss
of
air
the
birds
that
filled
the
sky
with
song
the
stream
that
laughed
its
way
along
her
home
to
her
was
shrine
and
throne
but
one
love
held
her
not
alone
she
sought
out
poverty
and
grief
who
touched
her
robe
and
found
relief
so
sped
she
in
her
master
work
too
busy
and
too
brave
to
shirk
when
through
the
silence
dusk
and
dim
god
called
her
and
she
fled
to
him
we
wonder
at
the
early
call
and
tears
of
sorrow
can
but
fall
for
her
whom
we
spread
the
pall
but
faith
sweet
faith
is
over
all
the
house
is
dust
the
voice
is
dumb
but
through
undying
years
to
come
the
spark
that
glowed
within
her
soul
shall
light
our
footsteps
to
the
goal
she
went
her
way
but
oh
she
trod
the
path
that
led
her
straight
to
god
such
lives
as
this
put
death
to
scorn
they
lose
our
day
to
find
god

brother
when
weary
come
when
thy
lonely
heart
swells
i
guide
thy
footsteps
and
lead
thee
down
where
the
dream
woman
dwells
over
the
hills
over
the
hills
and
the
valleys
of
dreaming
slowly
i
take
my
way
life
is
the
night
with
its
teeming
death
is
the
waking
at
day
down
thro
the
dales
and
the
bowers
of
loving
singing
i
roam
afar
daytime
or
i
constantly
roving
dearest
one
thou
art
my
star
with
the
lark
night
is
for
sorrow
and
dawn
is
for
joy
chasing
the
troubles
that
fret
and
annoy
darkness
for
sighing
and
daylight
for
song
cheery
and
chaste
the
strain
heartfelt
and
strong
all
the
night
through
though
i
moan
in
the
dark
i
wake
in
the
morning
to
sing
with
the
lark
deep
in
the
midnight
the
rain
whips
the
leaves
softly
and
sadly
the
grieves
but
when
the
first
hue
of
dawn
tints
the
sky
i
shall
shake
out
my
wings
like
the
birds
and
be
dry
and
though
like
the
i
grieved
through
the
dark
i
shall
wake
in
the
morning
to
sing
with
the
lark
on
the
high
hills
of
heaven
some
morning
to
be
where
the
rain
shall
not
grieve
thro
the
leaves
of
the
tree
there
my
heart
will
be
glad
for
the
pain
i
have
known
for
my
hand
will
be
clasped
in
the
hand
of
mine
own
and
though
life
has
been
hard
and
death
pathway
been
dark
i
shall
wake
in
the
morning
to
sing
with
the
lark
in
summer
oh
summer
has
clothed
the
earth
in
a
cloak
from
the
loom
of
the
sun
and
a
mantle
too
of
the
skies
soft
blue
and
a
belt
where
the
rivers
run
and
now
for
the
kiss
of
the
wind
and
the
touch
of
the
air
soft
hands
with
the
rest
from
strife
and
the
heat
of
life
with
the
freedom
of
lakes
and
lands
i
envy
the
farmer
boy
who
sings
as
he
follows
the
plow
while
the
shining
green
of
the
young
blades
lean
to
the
breezes
that
cool
his
brow
he
sings
to
the
dewy
morn
no
thought
of
another
ear
but
the
song
he
sings
is
a
chant
for
kings
and
the
whole
wide
world
to
hear
he
sings
of
the
joys
of
life
of
the
pleasures
of
work
and
rest
from
an
heart
without
aim
or
art
is
a
song
of
the
merriest
o
ye
who
toil
in
the
town
and
ye
who
moil
in
the
mart
hear
the
artless
song
and
your
faith
made
strong
shall
renew
your
joy
of
heart
oh
poor
were
the
worth
of
the
world
if
never
a
song
were
heard
if
the
sting
of
grief
had
no
relief
and
never
a
heart
were
stirred
so
long
as
the
streams
run
down
and
as
long
as
the
robins
trill
let
us
taunt
old
care
with
a
merry
air
and
sing
in
the
face
of
ill
the
mystic
sea
the
smell
of
the
sea
in
my
nostrils
the
sound
of
the
sea
in
mine
ears
the
touch
of
the
spray
on
my
burning
face
like
the
mist
of
reluctant
tears
the
blue
of
the
sky
above
me
the
green
of
the
waves
beneath
the
sun
flashing
down
on
a
sail
like
a
scimitar
from
its
sheath
and
ever
the
breaking
billows
and
ever
the
rocks
disdain
and
ever
a
thrill
in
mine
inmost
heart
that
my
reason
can
not
explain
so
i
say
to
my
heart
be
silent
the
mystery
of
time
is
here
death
way
will
be
plain
when
we
fathom
the
main
and
the
secret
of
life
be
clear
a
sailor
song
oh
for
the
breath
of
the
briny
deep
and
the
tug
of
the
bellying
sail
with
the
cry
across
the
sky
and
a
passing
boatman
hail
for
be
she
fierce
or
be
she
gay
the
sea
is
a
famous
friend
alway
ho
for
the
plains
where
the
dolphins
play
and
the
bend
of
the
mast
and
spars
and
a
fight
at
night
with
the
wild
when
the
foam
has
drowned
the
stars
and
pray
what
joy
can
the
landsman
feel
like
the
rise
and
fall
of
a
sliding
keel
fair
is
the
mead
the
lawn
is
fair
and
the
birds
sing
sweet
on
the
lea
but
the
echo
soft
of
a
song
aloft
is
the
strain
that
pleases
me
and
swish
of
rope
and
ring
of
chain
are
music
to
men
who
sail
the
main
then
if
you
love
me
let
me
sail
while
a
vessel
dares
the
deep
for
the
ship
my
wife
and
the
breath
of
life
are
the
raging
gales
that
sweep
and
when
i
done
with
calm
and
blast
a
slide
the
side
and
rest
at
last
the
bohemian
bring
me
the
livery
of
no
other
man
i
am
my
own
to
robe
me
at
my
pleasure
accepted
rules
to
me
disclose
no
treasure
what
is
the
chief
who
shall
my
garments
plan
no
garb
conventional
but
i
attack
it
come
why
not
don
my
spangled
jacket
absence
my
love
for
i
have
dreamed
of
thee
in
waking
dreams
until
my
soul
is
lost
is
lost
in
passion
wide
and
shoreless
sea
where
like
a
ship
unruddered
it
is
tost
hither
and
thither
at
the
wild
waves
will
there
is
no
potent
master
voice
to
still
this
newer
more
tempestuous
galilee
the
stormy
petrels
of
my
fancy
fly
in
warning
course
across
the
darkening
green
and
like
a
frightened
bird
my
heart
doth
cry
and
seek
to
find
some
rock
of
rest
between
the
threatening
sky
and
the
relentless
wave
it
is
not
length
of
life
that
grief
doth
crave
but
only
calm
and
peace
in
which
to
die
here
let
me
rest
upon
this
single
hope
for
oh
my
wings
are
weary
of
the
wind
and
with
its
stress
no
more
may
strive
or
cope
one
cry
has
dulled
mine
ears
mine
eyes
are
blind
would
that
all
the
intervening
space
i
might
fly
forth
and
see
thee
face
to
face
i
fly
i
search
but
love
in
gloom
i
grope
fly
home
far
bird
unto
thy
waiting
nest
spread
thy
strong
wings
above
the
sea
beat
the
grim
breeze
with
thy
unruffled
breast
until
thou
sittest
wing
to
wing
with
me
then
let
the
past
bring
up
its
tales
of
wrong
we
shall
chant
low
our
sweet
connubial
song
till
storm
and
doubt
and
past
no
more
shall
be
her
thought
and
his
the
gray
of
the
sea
and
the
gray
of
the
sky
a
glimpse
of
the
moon
like
a
eye
the
gleam
on
the
waves
and
the
light
on
the
land
a
thrill
in
my
heart
and
my
sweetheart
hand
she
turned
from
the
sea
with
a
woman
grace
and
the
light
fell
soft
on
her
upturned
face
and
i
thought
of
the
of
infinite
bliss
that
would
flow
to
my
heart
from
a
single
kiss
but
my
sweetheart
was
shy
so
i
dared
not
ask
for
the
boon
so
bravely
i
wore
the
mask
but
into
her
face
there
came
a
flame
i
wonder
could
she
have
been
thinking
the
same
the
right
to
die
i
have
no
fancy
for
that
ancient
cant
that
makes
us
masters
of
our
destinies
and
not
our
lives
to
hold
or
give
them
up
as
will
directs
i
can
not
will
not
think
that
men
the
subtle
worms
who
plot
and
plan
and
scheme
and
calculate
with
such
shrewd
wit
are
such
great
fools
as
not
to
know
when
they
have
lived
enough
men
court
not
death
when
there
are
sweets
still
left
in
life
to
taste
nor
will
a
brave
man
choose
to
live
when
he
full
deeply
drunk
of
life
has
reached
the
dregs
and
knows
that
now
but
bitterness
remains
he
is
the
coward
who
outfaced
in
this
fears
the
false
goblins
of
another
life
i
honor
him
who
being
much
harassed
drinks
of
sweet
courage
until
drunk
of
it
then
seizing
death
reluctant
by
the
hand
leaps
with
him
fearless
to
eternal
peace
behind
the
arras
as
in
some
dim
baronial
hall
restrained
a
prisoner
sits
engirt
by
secret
doors
and
waving
tapestries
that
argue
forth
strange
passages
into
the
outer
air
so
in
this
dimmer
room
which
we
call
life
thus
sits
the
soul
and
marks
with
eye
intent
that
mystic
curtain
the
portal
death
still
deeming
that
behind
the
arras
lies
the
lambent
way
that
leads
to
lasting
light
poor
fooled
and
foolish
soul
know
now
that
death
is
but
a
blind
false
door
that
nowhere
leads
and
gives
no
hope
of
exit
final
free
when
the
old
man
smokes
in
the
forenoon
restful
quiet
when
the
boys
are
off
at
school
when
the
window
lights
are
shaded
and
the
cool
then
the
old
man
seeks
his
armchair
lights
his
pipe
and
settles
back
falls
as
he
draws
it
till
the
gather
black
and
the
come
down
his
cheeks
a
silver
flow
smoke
or
memories
you
wonder
but
you
never
ask
him
no
for
there
something
almost
sacred
to
the
other
family
folks
in
those
moods
of
silent
dreaming
when
the
old
man
smokes
ah
perhaps
he
sits
there
dreaming
of
the
love
of
other
days
and
of
how
he
used
to
lead
her
through
the
merry
dance
maze
how
he
called
her
little
princess
and
to
please
her
used
to
twine
tender
wreaths
to
crown
her
tresses
from
the
matrimony
vine
then
before
his
mental
vision
comes
perhaps
a
sadder
day
when
they
left
his
little
princess
sleeping
with
her
fellow
clay
how
his
young
heart
throbbed
and
pained
him
why
the
memory
of
it
chokes
is
it
of
these
things
he
thinking
when
the
old
man
smokes
but
some
brighter
thoughts
possess
him
for
the
tears
are
dried
the
while
and
the
old
worn
face
is
wrinkled
in
a
reminiscent
smile
from
the
middle
of
the
forehead
to
the
feebly
trembling
lip
at
some
ancient
prank
remembered
or
some
long
quip
then
the
lips
relax
their
tension
and
the
pipe
begins
to
slide
till
in
little
clouds
of
ashes
it
falls
softly
at
his
side
and
his
head
bends
low
and
lower
till
his
chin
lies
on
his
breast
and
he
sits
in
peaceful
slumber
like
a
little
child
at
rest
dear
old
man
there
something
in
these
dreamy
moods
of
yours
since
the
present
proves
so
fleeting
all
the
past
for
you
endures
weeping
at
forgotten
sorrows
smiling
at
forgotten
jokes
life
epitomized
in
minutes
when
the
old
man
smokes
the
garret
within
a
london
garret
high
above
the
roofs
and
near
the
sky
my
pen
i
ply
to
win
me
bread
this
little
chamber
six
by
four
is
castle
study
den
and
more
altho
no
carpet
decks
the
floor
nor
down
the
bed
my
room
is
rather
bleak
and
bare
i
only
have
one
broken
chair
but
then
there
plenty
of
fresh
air
some
light
beside
what
tho
i
can
not
ask
my
friends
to
share
with
me
my
odds
and
ends
a
liberty
my
aerie
lends
to
most
denied
the
bore
who
falters
at
the
stair
no
more
shall
be
my
curse
and
care
and
duns
shall
fail
to
find
my
lair
with
beastly
bills
when
debts
have
grown
and
funds
are
short
i
find
it
rather
pleasant
sport
to
live
above
the
common
sort
with
all
their
ills
i
write
my
rhymes
and
sing
away
and
dawn
may
come
or
dusk
or
day
tho
fare
be
poor
my
heart
is
gay
and
full
of
glee
though
be
all
my
views
is
nearer
for
the
winging
muse
so
i
am
sure
she
not
refuse
to
visit
me
to
on
the
receipt
of
a
familiar
poem
to
me
like
hauntings
of
a
vagrant
breath
from
some
far
forest
which
i
once
have
known
the
perfume
of
this
flower
of
verse
is
blown
tho
seemingly
faint
to
death
naught
that
with
joy
she
bears
withereth
so
tho
the
pregnant
years
have
come
and
flown
lives
come
and
gone
and
altered
like
mine
own
this
poem
comes
to
me
a
shibboleth
brings
sound
of
past
communings
to
my
ear
turns
round
the
tide
of
time
and
bears
me
back
along
an
old
and
long
untraversed
way
makes
me
forget
this
is
a
later
year
makes
me
tread
a
reminiscent
track
half
sad
half
glad
to
one
forgotten
day
a
bridal
measure
come
essay
a
sprightly
measure
tuned
to
some
light
song
of
pleasure
maidens
let
your
brows
be
crowned
as
we
foot
this
merry
round
from
the
ground
a
voice
is
singing
from
the
sod
a
soul
is
springing
who
shall
say
is
but
a
clod
upward
toward
its
god
who
shall
say
it
who
may
know
it
that
the
clod
is
not
a
poet
waiting
but
a
gleam
to
waken
in
a
spirit
phyllis
phyllis
why
be
waiting
in
the
woods
the
birds
are
mating
from
the
tree
beside
the
wall
hear
the
robin
call
listen
to
yon
thrush
trilling
phyllis
phyllis
are
you
willing
when
love
speaks
from
cave
and
tree
only
we
should
silent
be
when
the
year
itself
renewing
all
the
world
with
flowers
is
strewing
then
through
youth
arcadian
land
love
and
song
go
hand
in
hand
come
unfold
your
vocal
treasure
sing
with
me
a
nuptial
measure
let
this
springtime
gambol
be
bridal
dance
for
you
and
me
vengeance
is
sweet
when
i
was
young
i
longed
for
love
and
held
his
glory
far
above
all
other
earthly
things
i
cried
come
love
dear
love
with
me
abide
and
with
my
subtlest
art
i
wooed
and
eagerly
the
wight
pursued
but
love
was
gay
and
love
was
shy
he
laughed
at
me
and
passed
me
by
well
i
grew
old
and
i
grew
gray
when
wealth
came
wending
down
my
way
i
took
his
golden
hand
with
glee
and
comrades
from
that
day
were
we
then
love
came
back
with
doleful
face
and
prayed
that
i
would
give
him
place
but
though
his
eyes
with
tears
were
dim
i
turned
my
back
and
laughed
at
him
a
hymn
after
reading
lead
kindly
light
lead
gently
lord
and
slow
for
oh
my
steps
are
weak
and
ever
as
i
go
some
soothing
sentence
speak
that
i
may
turn
my
face
through
doubt
obscurity
toward
thine
tho
i
can
not
see
for
lo
the
way
is
dark
through
mist
and
cloud
i
grope
save
for
that
fitful
spark
the
little
flame
of
hope
lead
gently
lord
and
slow
for
fear
that
i
may
fall
i
know
not
where
to
go
unless
i
hear
thy
call
my
fainting
soul
doth
yearn
for
thy
green
hills
afar
so
let
thy
mercy
burn
my
greater
guiding
star
just
whistle
a
bit
just
whistle
a
bit
if
the
day
be
dark
and
the
sky
be
overcast
if
mute
be
the
voice
of
the
piping
lark
why
pipe
your
own
small
blast
and
it
wonderful
how
the
gray
the
truant
warbler
comes
stealing
back
but
why
need
he
come
for
your
soul
at
rest
and
the
song
in
the
heart
ah
that
is
best
just
whistle
a
bit
if
the
night
be
drear
and
the
stars
refuse
to
shine
and
a
gleam
that
mocks
the
starlight
clear
within
you
glows
benign
till
the
dearth
of
light
in
the
glooming
skies
is
lost
to
the
sight
of
your
eyes
what
matters
the
absence
of
moon
or
star
the
light
within
is
the
best
by
far
just
whistle
a
bit
if
there
work
to
do
with
the
mind
or
in
the
soil
and
your
note
will
turn
out
a
talisman
true
to
exorcise
grim
toil
it
will
lighten
your
burden
and
make
you
feel
that
there
nothing
like
work
as
a
sauce
for
a
meal
and
with
song
in
your
heart
and
the
meal
in
its
place
there
be
joy
in
your
bosom
and
light
in
your
face
just
whistle
a
bit
if
your
heart
be
sore
is
a
wonderful
balm
for
pain
just
pipe
some
old
melody
and
till
it
soothes
like
summer
rain
and
perhaps
would
be
best
in
a
later
day
when
death
comes
stalking
down
the
way
to
knock
at
your
bosom
and
see
if
you
fit
then
as
you
wait
calmly
just
whistle
a
bit
the
barrier
the
midnight
wooed
the
and
prayed
her
love
come
nearer
your
swinging
coldly
there
afar
to
me
but
makes
you
dearer
the
was
pale
with
dole
as
said
she
low
replying
oh
lover
mine
soul
of
my
soul
for
you
i
too
am
sighing
but
one
ordained
when
we
were
born
in
spite
of
love
insistence
that
night
might
only
view
the
morn
adoring
at
a
distance
but
as
she
spoke
the
jealous
sun
across
the
heavens
panted
oh
whining
fools
he
cried
have
done
your
wishes
shall
be
granted
he
hurled
his
flaming
lances
far
the
twain
stood
unaffrighted
and
midnight
and
the
lay
down
in
death
united
dreams
dream
on
for
dreams
are
sweet
do
not
awaken
dream
on
and
at
thy
feet
pomegranates
shall
be
shaken
who
likeneth
the
youth
of
life
to
morning
is
like
the
night
in
truth
dreams
adorning
the
wind
is
soft
above
the
shadows
umber
there
is
a
dream
called
love
take
thou
the
fullest
slumber
in
lethe
soothing
stream
thy
thirst
thou
slakest
sleep
sleep
is
sweet
to
dream
oh
weep
when
thou
awakest
the
dreamer
temples
he
built
and
palaces
of
air
and
with
the
artist
aglow
his
fancy
saw
his
vague
ideals
grow
into
creations
marvellously
fair
he
set
his
foot
upon
fame
nether
stair
but
ah
his
dream
it
had
entranced
him
so
he
could
not
move
he
could
no
farther
go
but
paused
in
joy
that
he
was
even
there
he
did
not
wake
until
one
day
there
gleamed
thro
his
dark
consciousness
a
light
that
racked
his
being
till
he
rose
alert
to
act
but
lo
what
he
had
dreamed
the
while
he
dreamed
another
wedding
action
unto
thought
into
the
living
pulsing
world
had
brought
waiting
the
sun
has
slipped
his
tether
and
galloped
down
the
west
oh
it
weary
weary
waiting
love
the
little
bird
is
sleeping
in
the
softness
of
its
nest
night
follows
day
day
follows
dawn
and
so
the
time
has
come
and
gone
and
it
weary
weary
waiting
love
the
cruel
wind
is
rising
with
a
whistle
and
a
wail
and
it
weary
weary
waiting
love
my
eyes
are
seaward
straining
for
the
coming
of
a
sail
but
void
the
sea
and
void
the
beach
far
and
beyond
where
gaze
can
reach
and
it
weary
weary
waiting
love
i
heard
the
ringing
how
long
ago
it
seems
oh
it
weary
weary
waiting
love
and
ever
still
its
knelling
crashes
in
upon
my
dreams
the
banns
were
read
my
frock
was
sewn
since
then
two
seasons
winds
have
blown
and
it
weary
weary
waiting
love
the
stretches
of
the
ocean
are
bare
and
bleak
oh
it
weary
weary
waiting
love
my
eyes
are
growing
dimmer
is
it
tears
or
age
or
spray
but
i
will
stay
till
you
come
home
strange
ships
come
in
across
the
foam
but
it
weary
weary
waiting
love
the
end
of
the
chapter
ah
yes
the
chapter
ends
we
even
lay
the
book
away
but
oh
how
sweet
the
moments
sped
before
the
final
page
was
read
we
tried
to
read
between
the
lines
the
author
designs
but
scant
reward
such
search
secures
you
saw
my
heart
and
i
saw
yours
the
master
he
who
penned
the
page
and
bade
us
read
it
he
is
sage
and
what
he
orders
you
and
i
can
but
obey
nor
question
why
we
read
together
and
forgot
the
world
about
us
time
was
not
unheeded
and
unfelt
it
fled
we
read
and
hardly
knew
we
read
until
beneath
a
sadder
sun
we
came
to
know
the
book
was
done
then
as
our
minds
were
but
new
lit
it
dawned
upon
us
what
was
writ
and
we
were
startled
in
our
eyes
looked
forth
the
light
of
great
surprise
then
as
a
tocsin
tolls
a
voice
spoke
forth
behold
your
souls
i
do
i
do
i
can
not
look
into
your
eyes
so
close
the
book
but
brought
it
grief
or
brought
it
bliss
no
other
page
shall
read
like
this
sympathy
i
know
what
the
caged
bird
feels
alas
when
the
sun
is
bright
on
the
upland
slopes
when
the
wind
stirs
soft
through
the
springing
grass
and
the
river
flows
like
a
stream
of
glass
when
the
first
bird
sings
and
the
first
bud
opes
and
the
faint
perfume
from
its
chalice
steals
i
know
what
the
caged
bird
feels
i
know
why
the
caged
bird
beats
his
wing
till
its
blood
is
red
on
the
cruel
bars
for
he
must
fly
back
to
his
perch
and
cling
when
he
fain
would
be
on
the
bough
and
a
pain
still
throbs
in
the
old
old
scars
and
they
pulse
again
with
a
keener
sting
i
know
why
he
beats
his
wing
i
know
why
the
caged
bird
sings
ah
me
when
his
wing
is
bruised
and
his
bosom
sore
when
he
beats
his
bars
and
he
would
be
free
it
is
not
a
carol
of
joy
or
glee
but
a
prayer
that
he
sends
from
his
heart
deep
core
but
a
plea
that
upward
to
heaven
he
flings
i
know
why
the
caged
bird
sings
love
and
grief
out
of
my
heart
one
winter
day
i
locked
young
love
and
threw
the
key
away
grief
wandering
widely
found
the
key
and
hastened
with
it
straightway
back
to
me
with
love
beside
him
he
unlocked
the
door
and
bade
love
enter
with
him
there
and
stay
and
so
the
twain
abide
for
evermore
love
chastening
once
love
grew
bold
and
arrogant
of
air
proud
of
the
youth
that
made
him
fresh
and
fair
so
unto
grief
he
spake
what
right
hast
thou
to
part
or
parcel
of
this
heart
grief
brow
was
darkened
with
the
storm
of
inward
strife
thrice
smote
he
love
as
only
he
might
dare
and
love
pride
purged
was
chastened
all
his
life
mortality
ashes
to
ashes
dust
unto

what
of
his
loving
what
of
his
lust
what
of
his
passion
what
of
his
pain
what
of
his
poverty
what
of
his
pride
earth
the
great
mother
has
called
him
again
deeply

sleeps

verdict

shall
he
be
tried

he
go

who
shall
the
court
convene

it

no

on
the
land

love
a
life
was
mine
full
of
the
close
concern
of
affairs
the
world
sped
fast
behind
me
ever
rolled
a
pregnant
past
a
present
came
equipped
with
lore
to
learn
art
science
letters
in
their
turn
each
one
allured
me
with
its
treasures
vast
and
i
staked
all
for
wisdom
till
at
last
thou
and
taught
my
soul
anew
to
yearn
i
had
not
dreamed
that
i
could
turn
away
from
all
that
men
with
brush
and
pen
had
wrought
but
ever
since
that
memorable
day
when
to
my
heart
the
truth
of
love
was
brought
i
have
been
wholly
yielded
to
its
sway
and
had
no
room
for
any
other
thought
she
gave
me
a
rose
she
gave
a
rose
and
i
kissed
it
and
pressed
it
i
love
her
she
knows
and
my
action
confessed
it
she
gave
me
a
rose
and
i
kissed
it
and
pressed
it
ah
how
my
heart
glows
could
i
ever
have
guessed
it
it
is
fair
to
suppose
that
i
might
have
repressed
it
she
gave
me
a
rose
and
i
kissed
it
and
pressed
it
was
a
rhyme
in
life
prose
that
uplifted
and
blest
it
man
nature
who
knows
until
love
comes
to
test
it
she
gave
me
a
rose
and
i
kissed
it
and
pressed
it
dream
song
i
long
years
ago
within
a
distant
clime
ere
love
had
touched
me
with
his
wand
sublime
i
dreamed
of
one
to
make
my
life
calm
may
the
panting
passion
of
a
summer
day
and
ever
since
in
almost
sad
suspense
i
have
been
waiting
with
a
soul
intense
to
greet
and
take
unto
myself
the
beams
of
her
my
star
the
lady
of
my
dreams
o
love
still
longed
and
looked
for
come
to
me
be
thy
far
home
by
mountain
vale
or
sea
my
yearning
heart
may
never
find
its
rest
until
thou
liest
rapt
upon
my
breast
the
wind
may
bring
its
perfume
from
the
south
is
it
so
sweet
as
breath
from
my
love
mouth
oh
naught
that
surely
is
and
naught
that
seems
may
turn
me
from
the
lady
of
my
dreams
dream
song
ii
pray
what
can
dreams
avail
to
make
love
or
to
mar
the
child
within
the
cradle
rail
lies
dreaming
of
the
star
but
is
the
star
by
this
beguiled
to
leave
its
place
and
seek
the
child
the
poor
plucked
rose
within
its
glass
still
dreameth
of
the
bee
but
tho
the
lagging
moments
pass
her
love
she
may
not
see
if
dream
of
child
and
flower
fail
why
should
a
maiden
dreams
prevail
christmas
in
the
heart
the
snow
lies
deep
upon
the
ground
and
winter
brightness
all
around
decks
bravely
out
the
forest
sere
with
jewels
of
the
brave
old
year
the
coasting
crowd
upon
the
hill
with
some
new
spirit
seems
to
thrill
and
all
the
temple
bells
achime
ring
out
the
glee
of
christmas
time
in
happy
homes
the
brown
vies
with
the
holly
now
and
here
and
there
like
pearls
there
show
the
berries
of
the
mistletoe
a
sprig
upon
the
chandelier
says
to
the
maidens
come
not
here
even
the
pauper
of
the
earth
some
kindly
gift
has
cheered
to
mirth
within
his
chamber
dim
and
cold
there
sits
a
grasping
miser
old
he
has
no
thought
save
one
of
gain
to
grind
and
gather
and
grasp
and
drain
a
peal
of
bells
a
merry
shout
assail
his
ear
he
gazes
out
upon
a
world
to
him
all
gray
and
snarls
why
this
is
christmas
day
no
man
of
ice
for
shame
for
shame
for
christmas
day
is
no
mere
name
no
not
for
you
this
ringing
cheer
this
festal
season
of
the
year
and
not
for
you
the
chime
of
bells
from
holy
temple
rolls
and
swells
in
day
and
deed
he
has
no
part
who
holds
not
christmas
in
his
heart
the
king
is
dead
aye
lay
him
in
his
grave
the
old
dead
year
his
life
is
lived
fulfilled
his
destiny
have
you
for
him
no
sad
regretful
tear
to
drop
beside
the
cold
unfollowed
bier
can
you
not
pay
the
tribute
of
a
sigh
was
he
not
kind
to
you
this
dead
old
year
did
he
not
give
enough
of
earthly
store
enough
of
love
and
laughter
and
good
cheer
have
not
the
skies
you
scanned
sometimes
been
clear
how
then
of
him
who
dies
could
you
ask
more
it
is
not
well
to
hate
him
for
the
pain
he
brought
you
and
the
sorrows
manifold
to
pardon
him
these
hurts
still
i
am
fain
for
in
the
panting
period
of
his
reign
he
brought
me
new
wounds
but
he
healed
the
old
one
little
sigh
for
thee
my
poor
dead
friend
one
little
sigh
while
my
companions
sing
thou
art
so
soon
forgotten
in
the
end
we
cry
as
thy
footsteps
downward
tend
the
king
is
dead
long
live

there
is
a
heaven
for
ever
day
by
day
the
upward
longing
of
my
soul
doth
tell
me
so
there
is
a
hell
i
quite
as
sure
for
pray
if
there
were
not
where
would
my
neighbours
go
resignation
long
had
i
grieved
at
what
i
deemed
abuse
but
now
i
am
as
grain
within
the
mill
if
so
be
thou
must
crush
me
for
thy
use
grind
on
o
potent
god
and
do
thy
will
love
humility
as
some
rapt
gazer
on
the
lowly
earth
looks
up
to
radiant
planets
ranging
far
so
i
whose
soul
doth
know
thy
wondrous
worth
look
longing
up
to
thee
as
to
a
star
precedent
the
poor
man
went
to
the
rich
man
doors
i
come
as
lazarus
came
he
said
the
rich
man
turned
with
humble
head
i
will
send
my
dogs
to
lick
your
sores
she
told
her
beads
she
told
her
beads
with
eyes
within
the
ancient
chapel
dim
and
ever
as
her
fingers
slim
slipt
th
insensate
ivories
my
rapt
soul
followed
ah
many
were
the
beads
she
wore
but
as
she
told
them
and
they
did
not
number
all
my
sighs
my
heart
was
filled
with
unvoiced
cries
and
prayers
and
pleadings
unexpressed
but
while
i
burned
with
love
unrest
she
told
her
beads
with
eyes
little
lucy
landman
oh
the
day
has
set
me
dreaming
in
a
strange
half
solemn
way
of
the
feelings
i
experienced
on
another
long
past
day
of
the
way
my
heart
made
music
when
the
buds
began
to
blow
and
o
little
lucy
landman
whom
i
loved
long
years
ago
it
in
spring
the
poet
tells
us
that
we
turn
to
thoughts
of
love
and
our
hearts
go
out
with
the
lapwing
and
the
dove
but
the
soul
goes
seeking
its
upon
the
wing
i
a
notion
backed
by
that
it
love
that
makes
the
spring
i
have
heard
a
robin
singing
when
the
boughs
were
brown
and
bare
and
the
chilling
hand
of
winter
scattered
jewels
through
the
air
and
in
spite
of
dates
and
seasons
it
was
always
spring
i
know
when
i
loved
lucy
landman
in
the
days
of
long
ago
ah
my
little
lucy
landman
i
remember
you
as
well
as
if
were
only
yesterday
i
strove
your
thoughts
to
tell
when
i
tilted
back
your
bonnet
looked
into
your
eyes
so
true
just
to
see
if
you
were
loving
me
as
i
was
loving
you
ah
my
little
lucy
landman
it
is
true
it
was
denied
you
should
see
a
fuller
summer
and
an
autumn
by
my
side
but
the
glance
of
love
sweet
sunlight
which
your
eyes
that
morning
gave
has
kept
spring
within
my
bosom
though
you
lie
within
the
grave
the
gourd
in
the
heavy
earth
the
miner
toiled
and
laboured
day
by
day
wrenching
from
the
miser
mountain
brilliant
treasure
where
it
lay
and
the
artist
worn
and
weary
wrought
with
labour
manifold
that
the
king
might
drink
his
nectar
from
a
goblet
made
of
gold
on
the
prince
groaning
table
mid
the
silver
gleaming
bright
mirroring
the
happy
faces
giving
back
the
flaming
light
shine
the
cups
of
priceless
crystal
chased
with
many
a
lovely
line
glowing
now
with
warmer
colour
crimsoned
by
the
ruby
wine
in
a
valley
sweet
with
sunlight
fertile
with
the
dew
and
rain
without
miner
daily
labour
without
artist
nightly
pain
there
there
grows
the
cup
i
drink
from
summer
sweetness
in
it
stored
and
my
lips
pronounce
a
blessing
as
they
touch
an
old
brown
gourd
why
the
miracle
at
cana
in
the
land
of
galilee
tho
it
puzzles
all
the
scholars
is
no
longer
strange
to
me
for
the
poorest
and
the
humblest
could
a
priceless
wine
afford
if
they
only
dip
up
water
with
a
gourd
so
a
health
to
my
old
comrade
and
a
song
of
praise
to
sing
when
he
rests
inviting
kisses
in
his
place
beside
the
spring
give
the
king
his
golden
goblets
give
the
prince
his
crystal
hoard
but
for
me
the
sparkling
water
from
a
brown
and
brimming
gourd
the
knight
our
good
knight
ted
girds
his
broadsword
on
and
he
wields
it
well
i
ween
he
on
his
steed
and
away
has
gone
to
the
fight
for
king
and
queen
what
tho
no
edge
the
broadsword
hath
what
tho
the
blade
be
made
of
lath
is
a
valiant
hand
that
wields
the
brand
so
foeman
clear
the
path
he
prances
off
at
a
goodly
pace
is
a
noble
steed
he
rides
that
bears
as
well
in
the
speedy
race
as
he
bears
in
what
tho
is
but
a
that
prances
with
this
stately
air
is
a
warrior
bold
the
reins
doth
hold
who
bids
all
foes
beware
thou
art
my
lute
thou
art
my
lute
by
thee
i
sing
my
being
is
attuned
to
thee
thou
settest
all
my
words
and
meltest
me
to
melody
thou
art
my
life
by
thee
i
live
from
thee
proceed
the
joys
i
know
sweetheart
thy
hand
has
power
to
give
the
meed
of
love
the
cup
of
woe
thou
art
my
love
by
thee
i
lead
my
soul
the
paths
of
light
along
from
vale
to
vale
from
mead
to
mead
and
home
it
in
the
hills
of
song
my
song
my
soul
my
life
my
all
why
need
i
pray
or
make
my
plea
since
my
petition
can
not
fall
for
i
already
one
with
thee
the
phantom
kiss
one
night
in
my
room
still
and
beamless
with
will
and
with
thought
in
eclipse
i
rested
in
sleep
that
was
dreamless
when
softly
there
fell
on
my
lips
a
touch
as
of
lips
that
were
pressing
mine
own
with
the
message
of
bliss
a
sudden
soft
fleeting
caressing
a
breath
like
a
maiden
first
kiss
i
the
scoffer
may
doubt
me
i
peered
in
surprise
through
the
gloom
but
nothing
and
none
were
about
me
and
i
was
alone
in
my
room
perhaps
was
the
wind
that
caressed
me
and
touched
me
with
breath
or
maybe
there
passed
me
the
angel
of
death
some
sceptic
may
choose
to
disdain
it
or
one
feign
to
read
it
aright
or
wisdom
may
seek
to
explain
it
this
mystical
kiss
in
the
night
but
rather
let
fancy
thus
clear
it
that
thinking
of
me
here
alone
the
miles
were
made
naught
and
in
spirit
thy
lips
love
were
laid
on
mine
own
communion
in
the
silence
of
my
heart
i
will
spend
an
hour
with
thee
when
my
love
shall
rend
apart
all
the
veil
of
mystery
all
that
dim
and
misty
veil
that
shut
in
between
our
souls
when
death
cried
ho
maiden
hail
and
your
barque
sped
on
the
shoals
on
the
shoals
nay
wrongly
said
on
the
breeze
of
death
that
sweeps
far
from
life
thy
soul
has
sped
out
into
unsounded
deeps
i
shall
take
an
hour
and
come
sailing
darling
to
thy
side
wind
nor
sea
may
keep
me
from
soft
communings
with
my
bride
i
shall
rest
my
head
on
thee
as
i
did
long
days
of
yore
when
a
calm
untroubled
sea
rocked
thy
vessel
at
the
shore
i
shall
take
thy
hand
in
mine
and
live
the
olden
days
when
thy
smile
to
me
was
wine
golden
wine
thy
word
of
praise
for
the
carols
i
had
wrought
in
my
soul
simplicity
for
the
petty
beads
of
thought
which
thine
eyes
alone
could
see
ah
those
eyes
but
keen
for
my
welfare
and
my
weal
tho
the
shut
between
still
their
me
steal
i
can
see
thee
thro
my
tears
as
thro
rain
we
see
the
sun
what
tho
cold
and
cooling
years
shall
their
bitter
courses
run
i
shall
see
thee
still
and
be
thy
true
lover
evermore
and
thy
face
shall
be
to
me
dear
and
helpful
as
before
death
may
vaunt
and
death
may
boast
but
we
laugh
his
to
scorn
he
is
but
a
slave
at
most
night
that
heralds
coming
morn
i
shall
spend
an
hour
with
thee
day
by
day
my
little
bride
true
love
laughs
at
mystery
crying
doors
of
death
fly
wide
mare
rubrum
in
life
red
sea
with
faith
i
plant
my
feet
and
wait
the
sound
of
that
sustaining
word
which
long
ago
the
men
of
israel
heard
when
pharaoh
host
behind
them
fierce
and
fleet
raged
on
consuming
with
revengeful
heat
why
are
the
barrier
waters
still
unstirred
that
struggling
faith
may
die
of
hope
deferred
is
god
not
sitting
in
his
ancient
seat
the
billows
swirl
above
my
trembling
limbs
and
almost
chill
my
anxious
heart
to
doubt
and
disbelief
long
conquered
and
defied
but
tho
the
music
of
my
hopeful
hymns
is
drowned
by
curses
of
the
raging
rout
no
voice
yet
bids
th
opposing
waves
divide
in
an
english
garden
in
this
old
garden
fair
i
walk
with
all
the
beauty
of
the
scene
the
rich
luxuriant
grasses
cooling
green
the
wall
environ
and
gray
the
waving
branches
with
the
wind
at
play
the
slight
and
tremulous
blooms
that
show
between
sweet
all
and
yet
my
yearning
heart
doth
lean
toward
love
egyptian
fleshpots
far
away
beside
the
wall
the
slim
laburnum
grows
and
flings
its
golden
to
every
breeze
but
among
such
soothing
sights
as
these
i
pant
and
nurse
my
woes
of
all
the
longings
that
our
hearts
wot
of
there
is
no
hunger
like
the
want
of
love
the
crisis
a
man
of
low
degree
was
sore
oppressed
fate
held
him
under
sway
and
ever
those
who
saw
him
thus
distressed
would
bid
him
bend
his
stubborn
will
and
pray
but
he
strong
in
himself
and
obdurate
waged
prayerless
on
his
losing
fight
with
fate
friends
gave
his
proffered
hand
their
coldest
clasp
or
took
it
not
at
all
and
poverty
that
bruised
his
body
with
relentless
grasp
grinned
taunting
when
he
struggled
to
be
free
but
though
with
helpless
hands
he
beat
the
air
his
need
extreme
yet
found
no
voice
in
prayer
then
he
prevailed
and
forthwith
snobbish
fate
like
some
whipped
cur
came
fawning
at
his
feet
those
who
had
scorned
forgave
and
called
him
great
his
friends
found
out
that
friendship
still
was
sweet
but
he
once
obdurate
now
bowed
his
head
in
prayer
and
trembling
with
its
import
said
mere
human
strength
may
stand
frown
so
i
prevailed
for
human
strength
was
mine
but
from
the
killing
of
great
renown
naught
may
protect
me
save
a
strength
divine
help
me
o
lord
in
this
my
trembling
cause
i
scorn
men
curses
but
i
dread
applause
the
conquerors
the
black
troops
in
cuba
round
the
wide
earth
from
the
red
field
your
valour
has
won
blown
with
the
breath
of
the
gun
goes
the
word
bravely
you
spoke
through
the
battle
cloud
heavy
and
dun
tossed
though
the
speech
toward
the
sun
the
world
heard
hell
would
have
shrunk
from
you
seeking
it
fresh
from
the
fray
grim
with
the
dust
of
the
battle
and
gray
from
the
fight
heaven
would
have
crowned
you
with
crowns
not
of
gold
but
of
bay
owning
you
fit
for
the
light
of
her
day
men
of
night
far
through
the
cycle
of
years
and
of
lives
that
shall
come
there
shall
speak
voices
long
muffled
and
dumb
out
of
fear
and
through
the
noises
of
trade
and
the
turbulent
hum
truth
shall
rise
over
the
militant
drum
loud
and
clear
then
on
the
cheek
of
the
honester
nation
that
grows
all
for
their
love
of
you
not
for
your
woes
there
shall
lie
tears
that
shall
be
to
your
souls
as
the
dew
to
the
rose
afterward
thanks
that
the
present
yet
knows
not
to
ply
alexander
crummell
dead
back
to
the
breast
of
thy
mother
child
of
the
earth
her
caress
can
not
smother
what
thou
hast
done
follow
the
trail
of
the
westering
sun
over
the
earth
thy
light
and
his
were
as
one
sun
in
thy
worth
unto
a
nation
whose
sky
was
as
night
camest
thou
holily
bearing
thy
light
and
the
dawn
came
in
it
thy
fame
flashed
up
in
a
flame
back
to
the
breast
of
thy
mother
to
rest
long
hast
thou
striven
dared
where
the
hills
by
the
lightning
of
heaven
were
riven
go
now
pure
shriven
who
shall
come
after
thee
out
of
the
clay
learned
one
and
leader
to
show
us
the
way
who
shall
rise
up
when
the
world
gives
the
test
think
thou
no
more
of
this
rest
when
all
is
done
when
all
is
done
and
my
last
word
is
said
and
ye
who
loved
me
murmur
he
is
dead
let
no
one
weep
for
fear
that
i
should
know
and
sorrow
too
that
ye
should
sorrow
so
when
all
is
done
and
in
the
oozing
clay
ye
lay
this
hull
of
mine
away
pray
not
for
me
for
after
long
despair
the
quiet
of
the
grave
will
be
a
prayer
for
i
have
suffered
loss
and
grievous
pain
the
hurts
of
hatred
and
the
world
disdain
and
wounds
so
deep
that
love
and
pure
had
not
the
to
ease
them
or
to
cure
when
all
is
done
say
not
my
day
is
and
that
thro
night
i
seek
a
dimmer
shore
say
rather
that
my
morn
has
just
begun
i
greet
the
dawn
and
not
a
setting
sun
when
all
is
done
the
poet
and
the
baby
how
a
man
to
write
a
sonnet
can
you
tell
how
he
going
to
weave
the
dim
poetic
spell
when
on
the
floor
is
the
muse
he
must
adore
and
this
muse
he
loves
not
wisely
but
too
well
now
to
write
a
sonnet
every
one
allows
one
must
always
be
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
but
to
write
one
seems
to
me
quite
superfluous
to
be
when
you
got
a
little
sonnet
in
the
house
just
a
dainty
little
poem
true
and
fine
that
is
full
of
love
and
life
in
every
line
earnest
delicate
and
sweet
altogether
so
complete
that
i
wonder
what
the
use
of
writing
mine
distinction
i
am
but
clay
the
sinner
plead
who
fed
each
vain
desire
not
only
clay
another
said
but
worse
for
thou
art
mire
the
sum
a
little
dreaming
by
the
way
a
little
toiling
day
by
day
a
little
pain
a
little
strife
a
little
joy
and
that
is
life
a
little
summer
morn
when
joy
seems
all
so
newly
born
when
one
day
sky
is
blue
above
and
one
bird
sings
and
that
is
love
a
little
sickening
of
the
years
the
tribute
of
a
few
hot
tears
two
folded
hands
the
failing
breath
and
peace
at
last
and
that
is
death
just
dreaming
loving
dying
so
the
actors
in
the
drama
go
a
flitting
picture
on
a
wall
love
death
the
themes
but
is
that
all
sonnet
on
an
old
book
with
uncut
leaves
emblem
of
blasted
hope
and
lost
desire
no
finger
ever
traced
thy
yellow
page
save
time
thou
hast
not
wrought
to
noble
rage
the
hearts
thou
wouldst
have
stirred
not
any
fire
save
sad
flames
set
to
light
a
funeral
pyre
dost
thou
suggest
nay
impotent
in
age
unsought
thou
holdst
a
corner
of
the
stage
and
ceasest
even
dumbly
to
aspire
how
different
was
the
thought
of
him
that
writ
what
promised
he
to
love
of
ease
and
wealth
when
men
should
read
and
kindle
at
his
wit
but
here
decay
eats
up
the
book
by
stealth
while
it
like
some
old
maiden
solemnly
hugs
its
incongruous
virginity
on
the
sea
wall
i
sit
upon
the
old
sea
wall
and
watch
the
shimmering
sea
where
soft
and
white
the
moonbeams
fall
till
in
a
fantasy
some
pure
white
maiden
funeral
pall
the
strange
light
seems
to
me
the
waters
break
upon
the
shore
and
shiver
at
my
feet
while
i
dream
old
dreams
and
and
dim
old
scenes
repeat
tho
all
have
dreamed
the
same
before
they
still
seem
new
and
sweet
the
waves
still
sing
the
same
old
song
that
knew
an
elder
time
the
breakers
beat
is
not
more
strong
their
music
more
sublime
and
poets
thro
the
ages
long
have
set
these
notes
to
rhyme
but
this
shall
not
deter
my
lyre
nor
check
my
simple
strain
if
i
have
not
the
fire
i
know
the
ancient
pain
the
hurt
of
unfulfilled
desire
the
ember
quenched
by
rain
i
know
the
softly
shining
sea
that
rolls
this
gentle
swell
has
snarled
and
licked
its
tongues
at
me
and
bared
its
fangs
as
well
that
its
smile
so
heavenly
there
lurks
the
scowl
of
hell
but
what
of
that
i
strike
my
string
for
songs
in
youth
are
sweet
i
wait
and
hear
the
waters
bring
their
loud
resounding
beat
then
in
her
own
bold
numbers
sing
the
ocean
dear
deceit
to
a
lady
playing
the
harp
thy
tones
are
silver
melted
into
sound
and
as
i
dream
i
see
no
walls
around
but
seem
to
hear
a
gondolier
sing
sweetly
down
some
slow
venetian
stream
italian
skies
that
i
have
never
seen
i
see
above
ah
play
again
my
queen
thy
fingers
white
fly
swift
and
light
and
weave
for
me
the
golden
mesh
of
love
oh
thou
dusk
sorceress
of
the
dusky
eyes
and
soft
dark
hair
is
thou
that
my
skies
so
swift
to
change
to
far
and
strange
but
far
and
strange
thou
still
dost
make
them
fair
now
thou
dost
sing
and
i
am
lost
in
thee
as
one
who
drowns
in
floods
of
melody
still
in
thy
art
give
me
this
part
till
perfect
love
the
love
of
loving
crowns
confessional
search
thou
my
heart
if
there
be
guile
it
shall
depart
before
thy
smile
search
thou
my
soul
be
there
deceit
will
vanish
whole
before
thee
sweet
upon
my
mind
turn
thy
pure
lens
naught
shalt
thou
find
thou
canst
not
cleanse
if
i
should
pray
i
scarcely
know
in
just
what
way
my
prayers
would
go
so
strong
in
me
i
feel
love
leaven
i
bow
to
thee
as
soon
as
heaven
misapprehension
out
of
my
heart
one
day
i
wrote
a
song
with
my
heart
blood
imbued
instinct
with
passion
tremulously
strong
with
grief
subdued
breathing
a
fortitude
and
one
who
claimed
much
love
for
what
i
wrought
read
and
considered
it
and
spoke
ay
brother
is
well
writ
but
where
the
joke
prometheus
prometheus
stole
from
heaven
the
sacred
fire
and
swept
to
earth
with
it
land
and
sea
he
lit
the
vestal
flames
of
poesy
content
for
this
to
brave
celestial
ire
wroth
were
the
gods
and
with
eternal
hate
pursued
the
fearless
one
who
ravished
heaven
that
earth
might
hold
in
fee
the
perfect
leaven
to
lift
men
souls
above
their
low
estate
but
judge
you
now
when
poets
wield
the
pen
think
you
not
well
the
wrong
has
been
repaired
was
all
in
vain
that
ill
prometheus
fared
the
fire
has
been
returned
to
heaven
again
we
have
no
singers
like
the
ones
whose
note
gave
challenge
to
the
noblest
warbler
song
we
have
no
voice
so
mellow
sweet
and
strong
as
that
which
broke
from
shelley
golden
throat
the
measure
of
our
songs
is
our
desires
we
tinkle
where
old
poets
used
to
storm
we
lack
their
substance
tho
we
keep
their
form
we
strum
our
and
call
them
lyres
love
phases
love
hath
the
wings
of
the
butterfly
oh
clasp
him
but
gently
pausing
and
dipping
and
fluttering
by
inconsequently
stir
not
his
poise
with
the
breath
of
a
sigh
love
hath
the
wings
of
the
butterfly
love
hath
the
wings
of
the
eagle
bold
cling
to
him
strongly
what
if
the
look
of
the
world
be
cold
and
life
go
wrongly
rest
on
his
pinions
for
broad
is
their
fold
love
hath
the
wings
of
the
eagle
bold
love
hath
the
voice
of
the
nightingale
hearken
his
trilling
list
to
his
song
when
the
moonlight
is
pale
passionate
thrilling
cherish
the
lay
ere
the
lilt
of
it
fail
love
hath
the
voice
of
the
nightingale
love
hath
the
voice
of
the
storm
at
night
wildly
defiant
hear
him
and
yield
up
your
soul
to
his
might
tenderly
pliant
none
shall
regret
him
who
heed
him
aright
love
hath
the
voice
of
the
storm
at
night
for
the
man
who
fails
the
world
is
a
snob
and
the
man
who
wins
is
the
chap
for
its
money
worth
and
the
lust
for
success
causes
half
of
the
sins
that
are
cursing
this
brave
old
earth
for
it
fine
to
go
up
and
the
world
applause
is
sweet
to
the
mortal
ear
but
the
man
who
fails
in
a
noble
cause
is
a
hero
that
no
less
dear
is
true
enough
that
the
laurel
crown
twines
but
for
the
victor
brow
for
many
a
hero
has
lain
him
down
with
naught
but
the
cypress
bough
there
are
gallant
men
in
the
losing
fight
and
as
gallant
deeds
are
done
as
ever
graced
the
captured
height
or
the
battle
grandly
won
we
sit
at
life
board
with
our
nerves
highstrung
and
we
play
for
the
stake
of
fame
and
our
odes
are
sung
and
our
banners
hung
for
the
man
who
wins
the
game
but
i
have
a
song
of
another
kind
than
breathes
in
these
gales
an
ode
to
the
noble
heart
and
mind
of
the
gallant
man
who
fails
the
man
who
is
strong
to
fight
his
fight
and
whose
will
no
front
can
daunt
if
the
truth
be
truth
and
the
right
be
right
is
the
man
that
the
ages
want
tho
he
fail
and
die
in
grim
defeat
yet
he
has
not
fled
the
strife
and
the
house
of
earth
will
seem
more
sweet
for
the
perfume
of
his
life
harriet
beecher
stowe
she
told
the
story
and
the
whole
world
wept
at
wrongs
and
cruelties
it
had
not
known
but
for
this
fearless
woman
voice
alone
she
spoke
to
consciences
that
long
had
slept
her
message
freedom
clear
reveille
swept
from
heedless
hovel
to
complacent
throne
command
and
prophecy
were
in
the
tone
and
from
its
sheath
the
sword
of
justice
leapt
around
two
peoples
swelled
a
fiery
wave
but
both
came
forth
transfigured
from
the
flame
blest
be
the
hand
that
dared
be
strong
to
save
and
blest
be
she
who
in
our
weakness
came
prophet
and
priestess
at
one
stroke
she
gave
a
race
to
freedom
and
herself
to
fame
vagrants
long
time
ago
we
two
set
out
my
soul
and
i
know
not
why
for
all
our
way
was
dim
with
doubt
i
know
not
where
we
two
may
fare
though
still
with
every
changing
weather
we
wander
groping
on
together
we
do
not
love
we
are
not
friends
my
soul
and
i
he
lives
a
lie
untruth
lines
every
way
he
wends
a
scoffer
he
who
jeers
at
me
and
so
my
comrade
and
my
brother
we
wander
on
and
hate
each
other
ay
there
be
taverns
and
to
spare
beside
the
road
but
some
strange
goad
lets
me
not
stop
to
taste
their
fare
knew
i
the
goal
toward
which
my
soul
and
i
made
way
hope
made
life
fragrant
but
no
we
wander
aimless
vagrant
a
winter
day
across
the
hills
and
down
the
narrow
ways
and
up
the
valley
where
the
free
winds
sweep
the
earth
is
folded
in
an
ermined
sleep
that
mocks
the
melting
mirth
of
myriad
mays
departed
her
disheartening
duns
and
grays
and
all
her
crusty
black
is
covered
deep
dark
streams
are
locked
in
winter
and
made
to
shine
with
keen
unwonted
rays
o
icy
mantle
and
deceitful
snow
what
liars
in
your
hearts
ye
are
are
there
not
still
the
darkened
seam
and
scar
beneath
the
brightness
that
you
fain
would
show
come
from
the
cover
with
thy
blot
and
blur
o
reeking
earth
thou
whited
sepulchre
my
little
march
girl
come
to
the
pane
draw
the
curtain
apart
there
she
is
passing
the
girl
of
my
heart
see
where
she
walks
like
a
queen
in
the
street
calm
placid
and
sweet
tripping
along
with
impetuous
grace
joy
of
her
life
beaming
out
of
her
face
tresses
all
curl
upon
curl
and
rosy
my
little
march
girl
hint
of
the
violet
delicate
bloom
hint
of
the
rose
pervading
perfume
how
can
the
wind
help
from
kissing
her
face
wrapping
her
round
in
his
stormy
embrace
but
still
serenely
she
laughs
at
his
rout
she
is
the
victor
who
wins
in
the
bout
so
may
life
passions
about
her
soul
swirl
leaving
it
placid
my
little
march
girl
what
looks
out
of
her
eyes
what
are
the
wild
winds
and
what
are
the
skies
frowning
and
glooming
when
brimming
with
life
cometh
the
little
maid
ripe
for
the
strife
ah
wind
and
bah
wind
what
might
have
you
now
what
can
you
do
with
that
innocent
brow
blow
wind
and
grow
wind
and
eddy
and
swirl
but
bring
her
to
me
wind
my
little
march
girl
remembered
she
sang
and
i
listened
the
whole
song
thro
it
was
sweet
so
sweet
the
singing
the
stars
were
out
and
the
moon
it
grew
from
a
wee
soft
glimmer
way
out
in
the
blue
to
a
bird
thro
the
heavens
winging
she
sang
and
the
song
trembled
down
to
my
breast
it
was
sweet
so
sweet
the
singing
as
a
dove
just
out
of
its
fledgling
nest
and
putting
its
wings
to
the
first
sweet
test
flutters
homeward
so
wearily
winging
she
sang
and
i
said
to
my
heart
that
song
that
was
sweet
so
sweet
i
the
singing
shall
live
with
us
and
inspire
us
long
and
thou
my
heart
shalt
be
brave
and
strong
for
the
sake
of
those
words
the
woman
died
and
the
song
was
still
it
was
sweet
so
sweet
the
singing
but
ever
i
hear
the
same
low
trill
of
the
song
that
shakes
my
heart
with
a
thrill
and
goes
forever
winging
love
despoiled
as
lone
i
sat
one
summer
day
with
mien
dejected
love
came
by
his
face
distraught
his
locks
astray
so
slow
his
gait
so
sad
his
eye
i
hailed
him
with
a
pitying
cry
pray
love
what
has
disturbed
thee
so
said
i
amazed
thou
bereft
and
see
thy
quiver
hanging
low
what
not
a
single
arrow
left
pray
who
is
guilty
of
this
theft
poor
love
looked
in
my
face
and
cried
no
thief
were
ever
yet
so
bold
to
rob
my
quiver
at
my
side
but
time
who
rules
gave
ear
to
gold
and
all
my
goodly
shafts
are
sold
the
lapse
this
poem
must
be
done
then
i
to
it
i
must
not
dream
my
time
away
i
sure
to
rue
it
the
day
is
rather
bright
i
know
the
muse
will
pardon
my
if
i
go
into
the
garden
it
must
be
better
working
there
i
sure
it
sweeter
and
something
in
the
balmy
air
may
clear
my
metre
the
ah
this
is
noble
what
a
sky
what
breezes
blowing
the
very
clouds
i
know
not
why
call
one
to
rowing
the
stream
will
be
a
paradise
i
warrant
i
know
the
tide
that
on
the
rise
will
seem
a
torrent
i
know
just
how
the
leafy
boughs
are
all
i
know
how
many
skiffs
and
scows
are
on
the
river
i
think
i
just
go
out
awhile
before
i
write
it
when
nature
shows
us
such
a
smile
we
should
slight
it
for
nature
always
makes
desire
by
giving
pleasure
and
so
will
help
me
put
more
fire
into
my
measure
the
the
river
fine
i
glad
i
came
that
poem
teasing
but
health
is
better
far
than
fame
though
cheques
are
pleasing
i
do
know
what
i
did
it
for
this
air
a
poppy
i
sorry
for
my
editor
he
get
no
copy
the
warrior
prayer
long
since
in
sore
distress
i
heard
one
pray
lord
who
prevailest
with
resistless
might
ever
from
war
and
strife
keep
me
away
my
battles
fight
i
know
not
if
i
play
the
pharisee
and
if
my
brother
after
all
be
right
but
mine
shall
be
the
warrior
plea
to
thee
strength
for
the
fight
i
do
not
ask
that
thou
shalt
front
the
fray
and
drive
the
warring
foeman
from
my
sight
i
only
ask
o
lord
by
night
by
day
strength
for
the
fight
when
foes
upon
me
press
let
me
not
quail
nor
think
to
turn
me
into
coward
flight
i
only
ask
to
make
mine
arms
prevail
strength
for
the
fight
still
let
mine
eyes
look
ever
on
the
foe
still
let
mine
armor
case
me
strong
and
bright
and
grant
me
as
i
deal
each
righteous
blow
strength
for
the
fight
and
when
at
eventide
the
fray
is
done
my
soul
to
death
bedchamber
do
thou
light
and
give
me
be
the
field
or
lost
or
won
rest
from
the
fight
farewell
to
arcady
with
sombre
mien
the
evening
gray
comes
nagging
at
the
heels
of
day
and
driven
faster
and
still
faster
before
the
master
the
light
fades
from
her
fearful
eyes
she
hastens
stumbles
falls
and
dies
beside
me
amaryllis
weeps
the
swelling
tears
obscure
the
deeps
of
her
dark
eyes
as
mistily
the
rushing
rain
conceals
the
sea
here
lay
my
tuneless
reed
away
i
have
no
heart
to
tempt
a
lay
i
scent
the
perfume
of
the
rose
which
by
my
crystal
fountain
grows
in
this
sad
time
are
roses
blowing
and
thou
my
fountain
art
thou
flowing
while
i
who
watched
thy
waters
spring
am
all
too
sad
to
smile
or
sing
nay
give
me
back
my
pipe
again
it
yet
shall
breathe
this
single
strain
farewell
to
arcady
the
voice
of
the
banjo
in
a
small
and
lonely
cabin
out
of
noisy
traffic
way
sat
an
old
man
bent
and
feeble
dusk
of
face
and
hair
of
gray
and
beside
him
on
the
table
battered
old
and
worn
as
he
lay
a
banjo
droning
forth
this
reminiscent
melody
night
is
closing
in
upon
us
friend
of
mine
but
do
be
sad
let
us
think
of
all
the
pleasures
and
the
joys
that
we
have
had
let
us
keep
a
merry
visage
and
be
happy
till
the
last
let
the
future
still
be
sweetened
with
the
honey
of
the
past
for
i
speak
to
you
of
summer
nights
upon
the
yellow
sand
when
the
southern
moon
was
sailing
high
and
silvering
all
the
land
and
if
love
tales
were
not
sacred
there
a
tale
that
i
could
tell
of
your
many
nightly
wanderings
with
a
dusk
and
lovely
belle
and
i
speak
to
you
of
songs
when
labour
hour
was
and
a
woman
waiting
for
your
step
outside
the
cabin
door
and
of
something
that
you
took
upon
your
lap
while
you
listened
for
the
stumbling
hesitating
words
pap
i
could
tell
you
of
a
hunt
across
the
wooded
grounds
i
could
call
to
mind
the
sweetness
of
the
baying
of
the
hounds
you
could
lift
me
up
and
smelling
of
the
timber
that
in
me
build
again
a
whole
green
forest
with
the
of
a
tree
so
the
future
can
not
hurt
us
while
we
keep
the
past
in
mind
what
care
i
for
trembling
fingers
what
care
you
that
you
are
blind
time
may
leave
us
poor
and
stranded
circumstance
may
make
us
bend
but
they
only
find
us
mellower
wo
they
comrade
in
the
end
the
stirrup
cup
come
drink
a
stirrup
cup
with
me
before
we
close
our
rouse
you
all
aglow
with
wine
i
know
the
master
of
the
house
unmindful
of
our
revelry
has
drowned
the
carking
devil
care
and
slumbers
in
his
chair
come
drink
a
cup
before
we
start
we
far
to
ride
and
death
may
take
the
race
we
make
and
check
our
gallant
flight
but
even
he
must
play
his
part
and
tho
the
look
he
wears
be
grim
we
drink
a
toast
to
him
for
death
a
swift
old
chap
is
he
and
swift
the
steed
he
rides
he
needs
no
chart
main
or
mart
for
no
direction
bides
so
come
a
final
cup
with
me
and
let
the
soldiers
chorus
swell
to
hell
with
care
to
hell
a
choice
they
please
me
not
these
solemn
songs
that
hint
of
sermons
covered
up
is
true
the
world
should
heed
its
wrongs
but
in
a
poem
let
me
sup
not
simples
brewed
to
cure
or
ease
humanity
confessed
disease
but
the
of
a
singing
line
or
a
in
a
honey
cup
humour
and
dialect
then
and
now
then
he
loved
her
and
through
many
years
had
paid
his
fair
devoted
court
until
she
wearied
and
with
sneers
turned
all
his
ardent
love
to
sport
that
night
within
his
chamber
lone
he
long
sat
writing
by
his
bed
a
note
in
which
his
heart
made
moan
for
love
the
morning
found
him
dead
now
like
him
a
man
of
later
day
was
jilted
by
the
maid
he
sought
and
from
her
presence
turned
away
consumed
by
burning
bitter
thought
he
sought
his
room
to
write
a
curse
like
him
before
and
die
i
ween
ah
no
he
put
his
woes
in
verse
and
sold
them
to
a
magazine
at
cheshire
cheese
when
first
of
wise
old
johnson
taught
my
youthful
mind
its
homage
brought
and
made
the
crusty
sage
the
object
of
a
noble
rage
nor
did
i
think
how
dense
we
are
that
any
day
however
far
would
find
me
holding
unrepelled
the
place
that
doctor
johnson
held
but
change
has
come
and
time
has
moved
and
now
applauded
unreproved
i
hold
with
pardonable
pride
the
place
that
johnson
occupied
conceit
presumption
what
is
this
you
surely
read
my
words
amiss
like
johnson
i
a
man
of
mind
how
could
you
ever
be
so
blind
no
at
the
ancient
cheshire
cheese
blown
hither
by
some
vagrant
breeze
to
dignify
my
shallow
wit
in
doctor
johnson
seat
i
sit
my
pipe
men
may
sing
of
their
havanas
elevating
to
the
stars
the
real
or
fancied
virtues
of
their
cigars
but
i
worship
nicotina
at
a
different
sort
of
shrine
and
she
sits
enthroned
in
glory
in
this
pipe
of
mine
it
as
fragrant
as
the
meadows
when
the
clover
is
in
bloom
it
as
dainty
as
the
essence
of
the
daintiest
perfume
it
as
sweet
as
are
the
orchards
when
the
fruit
is
hanging
ripe
with
the
sun
warm
kiss
upon
them
is
this
pipe
thro
the
smoke
about
it
clinging
i
delight
its
form
to
trace
like
an
oriental
beauty
with
a
veil
upon
her
face
and
my
room
is
dim
with
vapour
as
a
church
when
censers
sway
as
i
clasp
it
to
my
bosom
in
a
figurative
way
it
consoles
me
in
misfortune
and
it
cheers
me
in
distress
and
it
proves
a
warm
partaker
of
my
pleasures
in
success
so
i
hail
it
as
a
symbol
friendship
true
and
worthy
type
and
i
press
my
lips
devoutly
to
my
pipe
in
august
when
august
days
are
hot
an
dry
when
burning
copper
is
the
sky
i
rather
fish
than
feast
or
fly
in
airy
realms
serene
and
high
i
take
a
suit
not
made
for
looks
some
easily
digested
books
some
flies
some
lines
some
bait
some
hooks
then
would
i
seek
the
bays
and
brooks
i
would
eschew
mine
every
task
in
nature
smiles
my
soul
should
bask
and
i
methinks
no
more
could
ask
except
perhaps
one
little
flask
in
case
of
accident
you
know
or
should
the
wind
come
on
to
blow
or
i
be
chilled
or
capsized
so
a
flask
would
be
the
only
go
then
could
i
spend
a
happy
time
a
bit
of
sport
a
bit
of
rhyme
a
bit
of
lemon
or
of
lime
to
make
my
bottle
contents
prime
when
august
days
are
hot
an
dry
i
wo
sit
by
an
sigh
or
die
i
get
my
bottle
on
the
sly
and
go
ahead
and
fish
and
lie
the
disturber
oh
what
shall
i
do
i
am
wholly
upset
i
am
sure
i
be
jailed
for
a
lunatic
yet
i
be
out
of
a
job
it
the
thing
to
expect
when
i
letting
my
duty
go
by
with
neglect
you
may
judge
the
extent
and
degree
of
my
plight
when
i
thinking
all
day
and
all
night
and
my
hand
at
a
rhyme
on
the
sly
all
on
account
of
a
sparkling
eye
there
are
those
who
say
men
should
be
strong
but
what
constitutes
strength
in
a
man
who
shall
say
i
am
strong
as
the
most
when
it
comes
to
the
arm
i
have
aye
held
my
own
on
the
playground
or
farm
and
when
i
been
tempted
i
have
been
weak
but
now
why
i
tremble
to
hear
a
maid
speak
i
used
to
be
bold
but
now
i
grown
shy
and
all
on
account
of
a
sparkling
eye
there
once
was
a
time
when
my
heart
was
devout
but
now
my
religion
is
open
to
doubt
when
parson
is
earnestly
preaching
of
grace
my
fancy
is
busy
with
drawing
a
face
thro
the
back
of
a
bonnet
most
piously
plain
draw
it
redraw
it
and
draw
it
again
while
the
songs
and
the
sermon
unheeded
go
by
all
on
account
of
a
sparkling
eye
oh
dear
little
conjurer
give
your
wiles
it
is
easy
for
you
you
all
blushes
and
smiles
but
love
of
my
heart
i
am
sorely
perplexed
i
am
smiling
one
minute
and
sighing
the
next
and
if
it
goes
on
i
drop
hackle
and
flail
and
go
to
the
parson
and
tell
him
my
tale
i
warrant
he
find
me
a
cure
for
the
sigh
that
you
aye
bringing
forth
with
the
glance
of
your
eye
expectation

nice
enough
now
there
is
folks
in
this
here
world
from
peasant
up

awful
nice
they
overdo
the

that
jest
the
thing
that
makes
me
sick
an
quicker
a
wink
i
set
it
down
that
them

folks
ai
half
so
good
you

i
like

an
we
all
must
have
our
vanity
an
pride
before
we
die
but
i
jedge
no
man
by
his
clothes
nor
gentleman
nor
tramp
the
man
that
wears
the
finest
suit
may
be
the
biggest
scamp
an
he
whose
limbs
air
clad
in
rags
that
make
a
mournful
sight
in
life
great
battle
may
have
proved
a
hero
in
the
fight
i
do
believe
in
i
like
the
honest
tan
that
lies
upon
the
healthful
cheek
an
speaks
the
honest
man
i
like
to
grasp
the
brawny
hand
that
labor
lips
have
kissed
for
he
who
has
not
labored
here
life
greatest
pride
has
missed
the
pride
to
feel
that
yore
own
strength
has
cleaved
fur
you
the
way
to
heights
to
which
you
were
not
born
but
struggled
day
by
day
what
though
the
thousands
sneer
an
scoff
an
scorn
yore
humble
birth
kings
are
but
puppets
you
are
king
by
right
o
royal
worth
the
man
who
simply
sits
an
waits
fur
good
to
come
along

worth
the

did
think
i

tempted
but
you
lak
to
made
me
sin
possum
trot
i
journeyed
men
an
things
an
i
learned
a
little
of
the
sense
that
meetin
people
brings
but
in
spite
of
all
my
travelling
an
of
all
i
think
i
know
i
got
one
notion
in
my
head
that
i
ca
git
to
go
an
it
is
that
the
folks
i
meet
in
any
other
spot
ai
half
so
good
as
them
i
knowed
back
home
in
possum
trot
i
know
you
never
heerd
the
name
it
ai
a
famous
place
an
i
reckon
ef
you
search
the
map
you
could
find
a
trace
of
any
sich
locality
as
this
i
named
to
you
but
never
mind
i
know
the
place
an
i
love
it
dearly
too
it
do
make
no
pretensions
to
bein
great
or
fine
the
circuses
do
come
that
way
they
ai
no
railroad
line
it
ai
no
great
big
city
where
the
schemers
plan
an
plot
but
jest
a
little
settlement
this
place
called
possum
trot
but
do
you
think
the
folks
that
lived
in
that
outlandish
place
were
ignorant
of
all
the
things
that
go
for
sense
or
grace
why
there
was
hannah
dyer
you
may
search
this
teemin
earth
an
never
find
a
sweeter
girl
er
one
o
greater
worth
an
uncle
abner
williams
on
his
staff
it
seems
like
i
kin
hear
him
talk
an
hear
his
hearty
laugh
his
heart
was
big
an
cheery
as
a
sunny
acre
lot
why
that
the
kind
o
folks
we
had
down
there
at
possum
trot
good
times
well
now
to
suit
my
taste
an
i
some
hard
to
suit
there
ai
been
no
sich
pleasure
sence
an
wo
be
none
to
boot
with
huskin
bees
in
harvest
time
an
dances
later
on
an
singin
school
an
taffy
pulls
an
fun
from
night
till
dawn
revivals
come
in
winter
time
baptizin
in
the
spring
you
ought
to
seen
those
people
shout
an
heerd
pray
an
sing
you
ought
to
heard
ole
parson
brown
gospel
shot
among
the
saints
an
sinners
in
the
days
of
possum
trot
we
live
up
in
the
city
now
my
wife
was
bound
to
come
i
hear
aroun
me
day
by
day
the
endless
stir
an
hum
i
reckon
that
it
done
me
good
an
yet
it
done
me
harm
that
oil
was
found
so
plentiful
down
there
on
my
ole
farm
we
got
a
preacher
our
church
is
too
an
i
come
down
from
what
i
knowed
to
rent
a
cushioned
pew
but
often
when
i
settin
there
it
foolish
like
as
not
to
think
of
them
ol
benches
in
the
church
at
possum
trot
i
know
that
i
ungrateful
an
sich
thoughts
must
be
a
sin
but
i
find
myself
a
wishin
that
the
times
was
back
agin
with
the
huskin
an
the
frolics
an
the
joys
i
used
to
know
when
i
lived
at
the
settlement
a
dozen
years
ago
i
do
feel
this
way
often
i
scarcely
ever
glum
for
life
has
taught
me
how
to
take
her
chances
as
they
come
but
now
an
then
my
mind

are
her
brown
eyes
and
swift
my

frame
thrills
with
tremulous
fires
dance
lady
dance
for

fleeting
pause
not

place
yon
refractory
curl
life
is
for
love
and
the
night
is
for
sweeting
dreamily
joyously
circle
and
whirl
oh
how
those
viols
are
throbbing
and
pleading
a
prayer
is
scarce
needed
in
sound
of
their
strain
surely
and
lightly
as
round
you
are
speeding
you
turn
to
confusion
my
heart
and
my
brain
dance
lady
dance
to
the
viol
soft
calling
skip
it
and
trip
it
as
light
as
the

dance
for
the
moments
like
rose
leaves
are
falling
strikes
now
the
clock
from
its
place
on
the
stair
now
sinks
the
melody
lower
and
lower
the
weary
musicians
scarce
seeming
to
play
ah
love
your
steps
now
are
slower
and
slower
the
smile
on
your
face
is
more
sad
and
less
gay
dance
lady
dance
to
the
brink
of
our
parting
my
heart
and
your
step
must
not
fail
to
be
light
dance

a
turn
tho
the
be
starting
ah

done
so
my
lady
reponse
when
phyllis
sighs
and
from
her
eyes
the
light
dies
out
my
soul
replies
with
misery
of
breath
as
it
were
at
war
with
death
when
phyllis
smiles
her
glance
beguiles
my
heart
through
woodland
aisles
and
through
the
silence
high
and
clear
a
wooing
warbler
song
i
hear
but
if
she
frown
despair
comes
down
i
put
me
on
my

not
phyllis

the

calm

cold
still

hold
then
a
breath
of
soft
perfume
then
a
light
within
the
gloom
thou
love
camest
to
my
side
and
the
gates
flew
open
wide
long
i
dwelt
in

my

there
does
she
bide
the

grim
as

steady

vague
and

brightly
the

the

pipes
to
the
shepherdess
the

to
his

sighs
as
she

their
song
nobody
sings
for
me
the
scullery
maids
have
swains
enow
who
lead
them
the
way
of
love
but
lonely
and
loveless
their
mistress
sits
at
her
window
up
above
loveless
and
lonely
she
waits
and
waits
the
saddest
in
all

when
the
life
of
the
land
was
threatened
by
the
slaver
cruel
greed
for
the
men
who
came
from
the
cornfield
who
came
from
the
plough
and
the
flail
who
rallied
round
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
mighty
man
of
the
rail
they
laid
them
down
in
the
valleys
they
laid
them
down
in
the
wood
and
the
world
looked
on
at
the
work
they
did
and
whispered
it
is
good
they
fought
their
way
on
the
hillside
they
fought
their
way
in
the
glen
and
god
looked
down
on
their
sinews
brown
and
said
i
have
made
them
men
they
went
to
the
blue
lines
gladly
and
the
blue
lines
took
them
in
and
the
men
who
saw
their
muskets
fire
thought
not
of
their
dusky
skin
the
gray
lines
rose
and
melted
beneath
their
scathing
showers
and
they
said
is
true
they
have
force
to
do
these
old
slave
boys
of
ours
ah
wagner
saw
their
glory
and
pillow
knew
their
blood
that
poured
on
a
nation
altar
a
sacrificial
flood
port
hudson
heard
their
that
smote
its
air
and
the
old
free
fires
of
their
savage
sires
again
were
kindled
there
they
laid
them
down
where
the
rivers
the
greening
valleys
gem
and
the
song
of
the
cannon
was
their
sole
requiem
and
the
great
smoke
wreath
that
mingled
its
hue
with
the
dusky
cloud
was
the
flag
that
furled
a
saddened
world
and
the
sheet
that
made
their
shroud
oh
mighty
god
of
the
battles
who
held
them
in
thy
hand
who
gave
them
strength
through
the
whole
day
length
to
fight
for
their
native
land
they
are
lying
dead
on
the
hillsides
they
are
lying
dead
on
the
plain
and
we
have
not
fire
to
smite
the
lyre
and
sing
them
one
brief
strain
give
thou
some
seer
the
power
to
sing
them
in
their
might
the
men
who
feared
the
master
whip
but
did
not
fear
the
fight
that
he
may
tell
of
their
virtues
as
minstrels
did
of
old
till
the
pride
of
face
and
the
hate
of
race
grow
obsolete
and
cold
a
song
for
the
unsung
heroes
who
stood
the
awful
test
when
the
humblest
host
that
the
land
could
boast
went
forth
to
meet
the
best
a
song
for
the
unsung
heroes
who
fell
on
the
bloody
sod
who
fought
their
way
from
night
to
day
and
struggled
up
to
god
the
pool
by
the
pool
that
i
see
in
my
dreams
dear
love
i
have
sat
with
you
time

again
and
listened
beneath
the
dank
leaves
dear
love
to
the
sibilant
sound
of
the
rain
and
the
pool
it
is
silvery
bright
dear
love
and
as
pure
as
the
heart
of
a
maid
as
sparkling
and
dimpling
it
darkles
and
shines
in
the
depths
of
the
heart
of
the
glade
but
oh
i

wish
in

wish

for

in

the
morning

on

the

that
beat

beat
in

blast
it
is
victory
at

now
for

but
my
comrades
come
behold
him
where
our
colors
now
enfold
him
and
his
breast
bares
no
more
to
meet
the
blade
but
lies
covered
in
the
shade
what
a
stir
there
is
they
are
laying
him
away
where
he
fell
there
the
flag
goes
draped
before
him
now
they
pile
the
grave
sod
him
with
a
knell
and
he
answers
to
his
name
in
the
higher
ranks
of
fame
there
a
woman
left
to
mourn
for
the
child
that
she
has
borne
in
travail
but
her
heart
beats
high
and
higher
with
the
patriot
mother
fire
at
the
tale
she
has
borne
and
lost
a
son
but
her
work
and
his
are
done
fling
the
flag
out
let
it
wave
they
returning
from
the
grave
double
quick
and
the
cymbals
now
are
crashing
bright
his
comrades
eyes
are
flashing
from
the
thick
which
knew
him
brave
no
tears
for
a
hero
grave
in
the
east
the
morning
comes
hear
the
rattle
of
the
drums
far
away
now
no
time
for
grief
pursuing

work
is
for

doing

the
word
is
writ
that
he
who
runs
may
read
what
is
the
passing
breath
of
earthly
fame
but
to
snatch
glory
from
the
hands
of
blame
that
is
to
be
to
live
to
strive
indeed
a
poor
virginia
cabin
gave
the
seed
and
from
its
dark
and
lowly
door
there
came
a
peer
of
princes
in
the
world
acclaim
a
master
spirit
for
the
nation
need
strong
silent
purposeful
beyond
his
kind
the
mark
of
rugged
force
on
brow
and
lip
straight
on
he
goes
nor
turns
to
look
behind
where
hot
the
hounds
come
baying
at
his
hip
with
one
idea
foremost
in
his
mind
like
the
keen
prow
of
some
ship
the
monk
walk
in
this
sombre
garden
close
what
has
come
and
passed
who
knows
what
red
passion
what
white
pain
haunted
this
dim
walk
in
vain
underneath
the
ivied
wall
where
the
silent
shadows
fall
lies
the
pathway
chill
and
damp
where
the
dreamers
tramp
just
across
where
sunlight
burns
smiling
at
the
mourning
ferns
stand
the
roses
side
by
side
nodding
in
their
useless
pride
ferns
and
roses
who
shall
say
what
you
witness
day
by
day
covert
smile
or
dropping
eye
as
the
monks
go
pacing
by
has
the
novice
come
here
beneath
the
wall
to
pray
has
the
young
monk
lately
chidden
sung
his
lyric
sweet
forbidden
tell
me
roses
did
you
note
that
pale
father
throbbing
throat
did
you
hear
him
murmur
love
as
he
kissed
a
faded
glove
mourning
ferns
pray
tell
me
why
shook
you
with
that
passing
sigh
is
it
that
you
chanced
to
spy
something
in
the
abbot
eye
here
no
dream
nor
thought
of
sin
where
no
worlding
enters
in
here
no
longing
no
desire
heat
nor
flame
of
earthly
fire
branches
waving
green
above
whisper
naught
of
life
nor
love
softened
winds
that
seem
a
breath
perfumed
bring
no
fear
of
death
is
it
living
thus
to
live
has
life
nothing
more
to
give
ah
no
more
of
smile
or
sigh
life
the
world
and
love
gray
and
passionless
and
dim
echoing
of
the
solemn
hymn
lies
the
walk
fern
and
rose
here
within
the
garden
close
if
death
should
claim
me
for
her
own
and
softly
i
should
falter
from
your
side
oh
tell
me
loved
one
would
my
memory
stay
and
would
my
image
in
your
heart
abide
or
should
i
be
as
some
forgotten
dream
that
lives
its
little
space
then
fades
entire
should
time
send
you
its
relentless
stream
to
cool
your
heart
and
quench
for
aye
love
fire
i
would
not
for
the
world
love
give
you
pain
or
ever
compass
what
would
cause
you
grief
and
oh
how
well
i
know
that
tears
are
vain
but
love
is
sweet
my
dear
and
life
is
brief
so
if
some
day
before
you
i
should
go
beyond
the
sound
and
sight
of
song
and
sea
would
give
my
spirit
stronger
wings
to
know
that
you
remembered
still
and
wept
for
me
slow
through
the
dark
slow
moves
the
pageant
of
a
climbing
race
their
footsteps
drag
far
far
below
the
height
and
unprevailing
by
their
utmost
might
seem
faltering
downward
from
each
hard
won
place
no
strange
exception
we
we
trace
a
devious
way
thro
dim
uncertain
light
our
hope
through
the
long
vistaed
years
a
sight
of
that
our
captain
soul
sees
face
to
face
who
faithless
faltering
that
the
road
is
steep
now
raiseth
up
his
drear
insistent
cry
who
stoppeth
here
to
spend
a
while
in
sleep
or
curseth
that
the
storm
obscures
the
sky
heed
not
the
darkness
round
you
dull
and
deep
the
clouds
grow
thickest
when
the
summit
nigh
the
murdered
lover
say
a
mass
for
my
soul
repose
my
brother
say
a
mass
for
my
soul

i
need
it
lovingly
lived
we
the
sons
of
one
mother
mine
was
the
sin
but
i
pray
you
not
heed
it
dark
were
her
eyes
as
the
sloe
and
they
called
me
called
me
with
voice
independent
of
breath
god
how
my
heart
beat
her
beauty
appalled
me
dazed
me
and
drew
to
the
of
death
lithe
was
her
form
like
a
willow
she
beckoned
what
could
i
do
save
to
follow
and
follow
nothing
of
right
or
result
could
be
reckoned
life
without
her
was
unworthy
and
hollow
ay
but
i
wronged
thee
my
brother
my
brother
ah
but
i
loved
her
thy
beautiful
wife
shade
of
our
father

soul
of
our

i
not
paid
for
my
love
with
my

dark
was
the
night
when
revengeful
i
met
you
deep
in
the
heart
of
a
desolate
land
warm
was
the
which
angrily
wet
you
sharp
was
the
knife
that
i
felt
from
your
hand
wept
you
oh
wept
you
alone
by
the
river
when
my
stark
carcass
you
secretly
sank
ha
now
i
see
that
you
tremble
and
shiver
was
but
my
spirit
that
passed
when
you
shrank
weep
not

not

the
midnight
of
the
gloomy
past
do
we
revert
we
look
upon
the
golden
present
and
the
future
vast
whose
vistas
show
us
visions
of
the
dawn
nor
shall
the
sorrows
of
departed
years
the
sweetness
of
our
tranquil
souls
annoy
the
sunshine
of
our
hopes
dispels
the
tears
and
clears
our
eyes
to
see
this
later
joy
not
ever
in
the
years
that
god
hath
given
have
we
gone
friendless
down
the
thorny
way
always
the
clouds
of
pregnant
black
were
riven
by
flashes
from
his
own
eternal
day
the
women
of
a
race
should
be
its
pride
we
glory
in
the
strength
our
mothers
had
we
glory
that
this
strength
was
not
denied
to
labor
bravely
nobly
and
be
glad
god
give
to
these
within
this
temple
here
clear
vision
of
the
dignity
of
toil
that
virtue
in
them
may
its
blossoms
rear
unspotted
fragrant
from
the
lowly
soil
god
bless
the
givers
for
their
noble
deed
shine
on
them
with
the
mercy
of
thy
face
who
come
with
open
hearts
to
help
and
speed
the
striving
women
of
a
struggling
race
a
roadway
let
those
who
will
stride
on
their
barren
roads
and
prick
themselves
to
haste
with
goads
unheeding
as
they
struggle
day
by
day
if
flowers
be
sweet
or
skies
be
blue
or
gray
for
me
the
lone
cool
way
by
purling
brooks
the
solemn
quiet
of
the
woodland
nooks
a
somewhere
trilling
sadly
gay
a
pause
to
pick
a
flower
beside
the
way
by
rugged
ways
by
rugged
ways
and
thro
the
night
we
struggle
blindly
toward
the
light
and
groping
stumbling
ever
pray
for
sight
of
long
delaying
day
the
cruel
thorns
beside
the
road
stretch
eager
points
our
steps
to
goad
and
from
the
thickets
all
about
detaining
hands
reach
threatening
out
deliver
us
oh
lord
we
cry
our
hands
uplifted
to
the
sky
no
answer
save
the
thunder
peal
and
onward
onward
still
we
reel
oh
give
us
now
thy
guiding
light
our
sole
reply
the
lightning
blight
vain
vain
cries
one
in
vain
we
call
but
faith
serene
is
over
all
beside
our
way
the
streams
are
dried
and
famine
mates
us
side
by
side
discouraged
and
reproachful
eyes
seek
once
again
the
frowning
skies
yet
shall
there
come
spite
storm
and
shock
a
moses
who
shall
smite
the
rock
call
manna
from
the
giver
hand
and
lead
us
to
the
promised
land
the
way
is
dark
and
cold
and
steep
and
shapes
of
horror
murder
sleep
and
hard
the
unrelenting
years
but
our
sighs
and
moans
and
tears
we
still
can
smile
we
still
can
sing
despite
the
arduous
journeying
for
faith
and
hope
their
courage
lend
and
rest
and
light
are
at
the
end
love
seasons
when
the
bees
are
humming
in
the
honeysuckle
vine
and
the
summer
days
are
in
their
bloom
then
my
love
is
deepest
oh
dearest
heart
of
mine
when
the
bees
are
humming
in
the
honeysuckle
vine
when
the
winds
are
moaning
the
meadows
chill
and
gray
and
the
land
is
dim
with
winter
gloom
then
for
thee
my
darling
love
will
have
its
way
when
the
winds
are
moaning
the
meadows
chill
and
gray
in
the
vernal
dawning
with
the
starting
of
the
leaf
in
the
time
of
spring
love
steals
all
my
senses
oh
the
thief
in
the
vernal
morning
with
the
starting
of
the
leaf
always
ever
always
even
in
the
autumn
drear
when
the
days
are
sighing
out
their
grief
thou
art
still
my
darling
dearest
of
the
dear
always
ever
always
even
in
the
autumn
drear
to
a
dead
friend
it
is
as
if
a
silver
chord
were
suddenly
grown
mute
and
life
song
with
its
rhythm
warred
against
a
silver
lute
it
is
as
if
a
silence
fell
where
bides
the
garnered
sheaf
and
voices
murmuring
it
is
well
are
stifled
by
our
grief
it
is
as
if
the
gloom
of
night
had
hid
a
summer
day
and
willows
sighing
at
their
plight
bent
low
beside
the
way
for
he
was
part
of
all
the
best
that
nature
loves
and
gives
and
ever
more
on
memory
breast
he
lies
and
laughs
and
lives
to
the
south
on
its
new
slavery
heart
of
the
southland
heed
me
pleading
now
who
bearest
unashamed
upon
my
brow
the
long
kiss
of
the
loving
tropic
sun
and
yet
whose
veins
with
thy
red
current
run
borne
on
the
bitter
winds
from
every
hand
strange
tales
are
flying
over
all
the
land
and
condemnation
with
his
pinions
foul
glooms
in
the
place
where
broods
the
midnight
owl
what
art
thou
that
the
world
should
point
at
thee
and
vaunt
and
chide
the
weakness
that
they
see
there
was
a
time
they
were
not
wont
to
chide
where
is
thy
old
uncompromising
pride
thou
shouldst
lift
up
thine
honored
head
white
with
the
sorrow
for
thy
loyal
dead
who
lie
on
every
plain
on
every
hill
and
whose
high
spirit
walks
the
southland
still
whose
infancy
our
mother
hands
have
nursed
thy
manhood
gone
to
battle
unaccursed
our
fathers
left
to
till
th
reluctant
field
to
rape
the
soil
for
what
she
would
not
yield
wooing
for
aye
the
cold
sod
whose
growth
for
them
still
meant
a
master
rod
tearing
her
bosom
for
the
wealth
that
gave
the
strength
that
made
the
toiler
still
a
slave
too
long
we
hear
the
deep
impassioned
cry
that
echoes
vainly
to
the
heedless
sky
too
long
too
long
the
macedonian
call
falls
fainting
far
beyond
the
outward
wall
within
whose
sweep
beneath
the
shadowing
trees
a
slumbering
nation
takes
its
dangerous
ease
too
long
the
rumors
of
thy
hatred
go
for
those
who
loved
thee
and
thy
children
so
thou
must
arise
forthwith
and
strong
thou
must
throw
off
the
smirching
of
this
baser
dust
lay
by
the
practice
of
this
later
creed
and
be
thine
honest
self
again
indeed
there
was
a
time
when
even
slavery
chain
held
in
some
joys
to
alternate
with
pain
some
little
light
to
give
the
night
relief
some
little
smiles
to
take
the
place
of
grief
there
was
a
time
when
jocund
as
the
day
the
toiler
hoed
his
row
and
sung
his
lay
found
something
gleeful
in
the
very
air
and
solace
for
his
toiling
everywhere
now
all
is
changed
within
the
rude
stockade
a
bondsman
whom
the
greed
of
men
has
made
almost
too
brutish
to
deplore
his
plight
toils
hopeless
on
from
joyless
morn
till
night
for
him
no
more
the
cabin
quiet
rest
the
homely
joys
that
gave
to
labor
zest
no
more
for
him
the
merry
banjo
sound
nor
trip
of
lightsome
dances
footing
round
for
him
no
more
the
lamp
shall
glow
at
eve
nor
chubby
children
pluck
him
by
the
sleeve
no
more
for
him
the
master
eyes
be
bright
he
has
nor
freedom
nor
a
slave
delight
what
was
it
all
for
naught
those
awful
years
that
drenched
a
groaning
land
with
blood
and
tears
was
it
to
leave
this
sly
convenient
hell
that
brother
fighting
his
own
brother
fell
when
that
great
struggle
held
the
world
in
awe
and
all
the
nations
blanched
at
what
they
saw
did
sanctioned
slavery
bow
its
conquered
head
that
this
unsanctioned
crime
might
rise
instead
is
it
for
this
we
all
have
felt
the
flame
this
newer
bondage
and
this
deeper
shame
nay
not
for
this
a
nation
heroes
bled
and
north
and
south
with
tears
beheld
their
dead
oh
mother
south
hast
thou
forgot
thy
ways
forgot
the
glory
of
thine
ancient
days
forgot
the
honor
that
once
made
thee
great
and
stooped
to
this
unhallowed
estate
it
can
not
last
thou
wilt
come
forth
in
might
a
warrior
queen
full
armored
for
the
fight
and
thou
wilt
take
with
thy
spear
in
rest
thy
dusky
children
to
thy
saving
breast
till
then
no
more
no
more
the
gladsome
song
strike
only
deeper
chords
the
notes
of
wrong
till
then
the
sigh
the
tear
the
oath
the
moan
till
thou
oh
south
and
thine
come
to
thine
own
the
haunted
oak
pray
why
are
you
so
bare
so
bare
oh
bough
of
the
old
and
why
when
i
go
through
the
shade
you
throw
runs
a
shudder
over
me
my
leaves
were
green
as
the
best
i
trow
and
sap
ran
free
in
my
veins
but
i
saw
in
the
moonlight
dim
and
weird
a
guiltless
victim
pains
i
bent
me
down
to
hear
his
sigh
i
shook
with
his
gurgling
moan
and
i
trembled
sore
when
they
rode
away
and
left
him
here
alone
they
charged
him
with
the
old
old
crime
and
set
him
fast
in
jail
oh
why
does
the
dog
howl
all
night
long
and
why
does
the
night
wind
wail
he
prayed
his
prayer
and
he
swore
his
oath
and
he
raised
his
hand
to
the
sky
but
the
beat
of
hoofs
smote
on
his
ear
and
the
steady
tread
drew
nigh
who
is
it
rides
by
night
by
night
over
the
moonlit
road
and
what
is
the
spur
that
keeps
the
pace
what
is
the
galling
goad
and
now
they
beat
at
the
prison
door
ho
keeper
do
not
stay
we
are
friends
of
him
whom
you
hold
within
and
we
fain
would
take
him
away
from
those
who
ride
fast
on
our
heels
with
mind
to
do
him
wrong
they
have
no
care
for
his
innocence
and
the
rope
they
bear
is
long
they
have
fooled
the
jailer
with
lying
words
they
have
fooled
the
man
with
lies
the
bolts
unbar
the
locks
are
drawn
and
the
great
door
open
flies
now
they
have
taken
him
from
the
jail
and
hard
and
fast
they
ride
and
the
leader
laughs
low
down
in
his
throat
as
they
halt
my
trunk
beside
oh
the
judge
he
wore
a
mask
of
black
and
the
doctor
one
of
white
and
the
minister
with
his
oldest
son
was
curiously
bedight
oh
foolish
man
why
weep
you
now
is
but
a
little
space
and
the
time
will
come
when
these
shall
dread
the
of
your
face
i
feel
the
rope
against
my
bark
and
the
weight
of
him
in
my
grain
i
feel
in
the
throe
of
his
final
woe
the
touch
of
my
own
last
pain
and
never
more
shall
leaves
come
forth
on
a
bough
that
bears
the
ban
i
am
burned
with
dread
i
am
dried
and
dead
from
the
curse
of
a
guiltless
man
and
ever
the
judge
rides
by
rides
by
and
goes
to
hunt
the
deer
and
ever
another
rides
his
soul
in
the
guise
of
a
mortal
fear
and
ever
the
man
he
rides
me
hard
and
never
a
night
stays
he
for
i
feel
his
curse
as
a
haunted
bough
on
the
trunk
of
a
haunted
tree
weltschmertz
you
ask
why
i
am
sad
i
have
no
cares
no
griefs
you
say
ah
yes
is
true
i
have
no
grief
but
is
there
not
the
falling
leaf
the
bare
tree
there
is
mourning
left
with
all
of
autumn
gray
bereft
it
is
not
what
has
happened
me
think
of
the
bare
dismantled
tree
the
birds
go
south
along
the
sky
i
hear
their
lingering
long
who
goes
reluctant
from
my
breast
and
yet
the
lone
and
nest
the
mourning
hearse
goes
by
why
does
a
tear
come
to
my
eye
is
it
the
march
rain
blowing
wild
i
have
no
dead
i
know
no
child
i
am
no
widow
by
the
bier
of
him
i
held
supremely
dear
i
have
not
seen
the
choicest
one
sink
down
as
sinks
the
westering
sun
faith
unto
faith
have
i
beheld
for
me
few
solemn
notes
have
swelled
love
bekoned
me
out
to
the
dawn
and
happily
i
followed
on
and
yet
my
heart
goes
out
to
them
whose
sorrow
is
their
diadem
the
falling
leaf
the
crying
bird
the
voice
to
be
all
lost
unheard
not
mine
not
mine
and
yet
too
much
the
thrilling
power
of
human
touch
while
all
the
world
looks
on
and
scorns
i
wear
another
crown
of
thorns
count
me
a
priest
who
understands
the
glorious
pain
of
hands
count
me
a
comrade
of
the
thief
hot
driven
into
late
belief
oh
mother
tear
oh
father
sigh
oh
mourning
sweetheart
last
i
yet
have
known
no
mourning
save
beside
some
brother
brother
grave
robert
gould
shaw
why
was
it
that
the
thunder
voice
of
fate
should
call
thee
studious
from
the
classic
groves
where
pallas
with
still
footstep
roves
and
charge
thee
seek
the
turmoil
of
the
state
what
bade
thee
hear
the
voice
and
rise
elate
leave
home
and
kindred
and
thy
spicy
loaves
to
lead
th
unlettered
and
despised
droves
to
manhood
home
and
thunder
at
the
gate
far
better
the
slow
blaze
of
learning
light
the
cool
and
quiet
of
her
dearer
fane
than
this
hot
terror
of
a
hopeless
fight
this
cold
endurance
of
the
final
pain
since
thou
and
those
who
with
thee
died
for
right
have
died
the
present
teaches
but
in
vain
roses
oh
wind
of
the
oh
free
wind
of
may
when
blossoms
and
are
rife
oh
joy
for
the
season
and
joy
for
the
day
that
gave
me
the
roses
of
life
of
life
that
gave
me
the
roses
of
life
oh
wind
of
the
summer
sing
loud
in
the
night
when
flutters
my
heart
like
a
dove
one
came
from
thy
kingdom
thy
realm
of
delight
and
gave
me
the
roses
of
love
of
love
and
gave
me
the
roses
of
love
oh
wind
of
the
winter
sigh
low
in
thy
grief
i
hear
thy
compassionate
breath
i
wither
i
fall
like
the
leaf
he
gave
me
the
roses
of
death
of
death
he
gave
me
the
roses
of
death
a
love
song
ah
love
my
love
is
like
a
cry
in
the
night
a
long
loud
cry
to
the
empty
sky
the
cry
of
a
man
alone
in
the
desert
with
hands
uplifted
with
parching
lips
oh
rescue
me
rescue
me
thy
form

you

from
that
half
height
where
i
had
sadly
climbed
i
stretched
my
hand
i
lone
in
all
that
land
down
there
where
helpless
you
were
limed
our
fingers
clasped
and
dragging
me
a
pace
you
struggled
up
it
is
a
bitter
cup
that
now
for
naught
you
turn
away
your
face
i
shall
remember
this
for
aye
and
aye
may
come
although
my
lips
are
dumb
my
spirit
holds
you
to
that
yesterday
in
the
tents
of
akbar
in
the
tents
of
akbar
are
dole
and
grief
for
the
flower
of
all
the
indies
has
gone
the
silent
way
in
the
tents
of
akbar
are
emptiness
and
gloom
and
where
the
dancers
gather
the
silence
of
the
tomb
across
the
yellow
desert
across
the
burning
sands
old
akbar
wanders
madly
and
wrings
his
fevered
hands
and
ever
makes
his
moaning
to
the
unanswering
sky
for
sutna
lovely
sutna
who
was
so
fair
to
die
for
sutna
danced
at
morning
and
sutna
danced
at
eve
her
dusky
eyes
half
hidden
behind
her
silken
sleeve
her
pearly
teeth
between
her
coral
lips
the
tremulous
rhythm
of
passion
marked
by
her
quivering
hips
as
lovely
as
a
jewel
of
fire
and
dewdrop
blent
so
danced
the
maiden
sutna
in
gallant
akbar
tent
and
one
who
saw
her
dancing
saw
her
bosom
fall
and
rise
put
all
his
body
yearning
into
his
lovelit
eyes
then
akbar
came
and
drove
him
a
jackal
from
his
door
and
bade
him
wander
far
and
look
on
sutna
face
no
more
some
day
the
sea
disgorges
the
wilderness
gives
back
those
who
have
wandered
aimless
across
its
track
and
he
returned
the
lover
haggard
of
brow
and
spent
he
found
fair
sutna
standing
before
her
master
tent
not
mine
nor
akbar
sutna
he
cried
and
closely
pressed
and
drove
his
craven
dagger
straight
to
the
maiden
breast
oh
weep
oh
weep
for
sutna
so
young
so
dear
so
fair
her
face
is
gray
and
silent
beneath
her
dusky
hair
and
wail
oh
wail
for
akbar
who
walks
the
desert
sands
crying
aloud
for
sutna
wringing
his
fevered
hands
in
the
tents
of
akbar
the
tears
of
sorrow
run
but
the
corpse
of
sutna
slayer
lies
rotting
in
the
sun
the
fount
of
tears
all
hot
and
grimy
from
the
road
dust
gray
from
arduous
years
i
sat
me
down
and
eased
my
load
beside
the
fount
of
tears
the
waters
sparkled
to
my
eye
calm
and
cool
and
breathing
there
a
restful
sigh
i
bent
me
to
the
pool
when
lo
a
voice
cried
pilgrim
rise
harsh
tho
the
sentence
be
and
on
to
other
lands
and
skies
this
fount
is
not
for
thee
pass
on
but
calm
thy
needless
fears
some
may
not
love
or
sin
an
angel
guards
the
fount
of
tears
all
may
not
bathe
therein
then
with
my
burden
on
my
back
i
turned
to
gaze
awhile
first
at
the
uninviting
track
then
at
the
water
smile
and
so
i
go
upon
my
way
the
sultry
years
but
pause
no
more
by
night
by
day
beside
the
fount
of
tears
life
tragedy
it
may
be
misery
not
to
sing
at
all
and
to
go
silent
through
the
brimming
day
it
may
be
sorrow
never
to
be
loved
but
deeper
griefs
than
these
beset
the
way
to
have
come
near
to
sing
the
perfect
song
and
only
by
a
lost
the
key
there
is
the
potent
sorrow
there
the
grief
the
pale
sad
staring
of
life
tragedy
to
have
just
missed
the
perfect
love
not
the
hot
passion
of
untempered
youth
but
that
which
lays
aside
its
vanity
and
gives
thee
for
thy
trusting
worship
truth
this
this
it
is
to
be
accursed
indeed
for
if
we
mortals
love
or
if
we
sing
we
count
our
joys
not
by
the
things
we
have
but
by
what

rides
the
hills
of
death
night
dim
night
night
dim
night
and
it
rains
my
love
it
rains
art
thou
dreaming
of
me
i
wonder
the
trees
are
sad
and
the
wind
complains
outside
the
rolling
of
the
thunder
and
the
beat
against
the
panes
heart
my
heart
thou
art
mournful
in
the
rain
are
thy
redolent
lips
my
soul
seeks
thine
doth
it
seek
in
vain
my
love
goes
surging
like
a
river
shall
its
tide
bear
naught
save
pain
lyrics
of
love
and
sorrow
i
love
is
the
light
of
the
world
my
dear
heigho
but
the
world
is
gloomy
the
light
has
failed
and
the
lamp
down
hurled
leaves
only
darkness
to
me
love
is
the
light
of
the
world
my
dear
ah
me
but
the
world
is
dreary
the
night
is
down
and
my
curtain
furled
but
i
can
not
sleep
though
weary
love
is
the
light
of
the
world
my
dear
alas
for
a
hopeless
hoping
when
the
flame
went
out
in
the
breeze
that
swirled
and
a
soul
went
blindly
groping
ii
the
light
was
on
the
golden
sands
a
glimmer
on
the
sea
my
soul
spoke
clearly
to
thy
soul
thy
spirit
answered
me
since
then
the
light
that
gilds
the
sands
and
glimmers
on
the
sea
but
vainly
struggles
to
reflect
the
radiant
soul
of
thee
iii
the
sea
speaks
to
me
of
you
all
the
day
long
still
as
i
sit
by
its
side
you
are
its
song
the
sea
sings
to
me
of
you
loud
on
the
reef
always
it
moans
as
it
sings
voicing
my
grief
iv
my
dear
love
died
last
night
shall
i
clothe
her
in
white
my
passionate
love
is
dead
shall
i
robe
her
in
red
but
nay
she
was
all
untrue
she
shall
not
go
drest
in
blue
still
my
desolate
love
was
brave
unrobed
let
her
go
to
her
grave
v
there
are
brilliant
heights
of
sorrow
that
only
the
few
may
know
and
the
lesser
woes
of
the
world
like
waves
break
noiselessly
far
below
i
hold
for
my
own
possessing
a
mount
that
is
lone
and
still
the
great
high
place
of
a
hopeless
grief
and
i
call
it
my
hill
and
once
on
a
winter
midnight
i
found
its
highest
crown
and
there
in
the
gloom
my
soul
and
i
weeping
we
sat
us
down
but
now
when
i
seek
that
summit
we
are
two
ghosts
that
go
only
two
shades
of
a
thing
that
died
once
in
the
long
ago
so
i
sit
me
down
in
the
silence
and
say
to
my
soul
be
still
so
the
world
may
not
know
we
died
that
night
from
weeping
on
hill
lyrics
of
sunshine
and
shadow
a
boy
summer
song
is
fine
to
play
in
the
fragrant
hay
and
romp
on
the
golden
load
to
ride
old
jack
to
the
barn
and
back
or
tramp
by
a
shady
road
to
pause
and
drink
at
a
mossy
brink
ah
that
is
the
best
of
joy
and
so
i
say
on
a
summer
day
what
so
fine
as
being
a
boy
ha
ha
with
line
and
hook
by
a
babbling
brook
the
fisherman
sport
we
ply
and
list
the
song
of
the
feathered
throng
that
flit
in
the
branches
nigh
at
last
we
strip
for
a
quiet
dip
ah
that
is
the
best
of
joy
for
this
i
say
on
a
summer
day
what
so
fine
as
being
a
boy
ha
ha
the
i
know
a
man
with
face
of
tan
but
who
is
ever
kind
whom
girls
and
boys
leaves
games
and
toys
each
eventide
to
find
when
day
grows
dim
they
watch
for
him
he
comes
to
place
his
claim
he
wears
the
crown
of
the
is
his
name
when
sparkling
eyes
troop
sleepywise
and
busy
lips
grow
dumb
when
little
heads
nod
toward
the
beds
we
know
the
come
johnny
speaks
the
he
a
jolly
old
fellow
his
face
is
kind
and
his
voice
is
mellow
but
he
makes
your
eyelids
as
heavy
as
lead
and
then
you
got
to
go
off
to
bed
i
do
think
i
like
the
but
i
been
playing
this
livelong
day

make
a
fellow
so
tired
to
play
oh

sad

empty
and
bare
for
softly
and
merrily
now
there
come
playing
the
little
white
birds
thro
the
air
the
squirrel
enjoying
the
rest
of
the
thrifty
he
munches
his
store
in
the
old
hollow
tree
tho
cold
is
the
blast
and
the
are
drifty
he
fears
the
white
flock
not
a
whit
more

the
forest
greeting
good
hunting
aye
good
hunting
wherever
the
forests
call
but
ever
a
heart
beats
hot
with
fear
and
what
of
the
birds
that
fall
good
hunting
aye
good
hunting
wherever
the
north
winds
blow
but
what
of
the
stag
that
calls
for
his
mate
and
what
of
the
wounded
doe
good
hunting
aye
good
hunting
and
ah
we
are
bold
and
strong
but
our
triumph
call
through
the
forest
hall
is
a
brother
funeral
song
for
we
are
brothers
ever
panther
and
bird
and
bear
man
and
the
weakest
that
fear
his
face
born
to
the
nest
or
lair
yes
brothers
and
who
shall
judge
us
hunters
and
game
are
we
but
who
gave
the
right
for
me
to
smite
who
boasts
when
he
smiteth
me
good
hunting
aye
good
hunting
and
dim
is
the
forest
track
but
the
sportsman
death
comes
striding
on
brothers
the
way
is
black
the
lily
of
the
valley
sweetest
of
the
flowers
in
the
fragrant
vernal
days
is
the
lily
of
the
valley
with
its
soft
retiring
ways
well
you
chose
this
humble
blossom
as
the
nurse
emblem
flower
who
grows
more
like
her
ideal
every
day
and
every
hour
like
the
lily
of
the
valley
in
her
honesty
and
worth
ah
she
blooms
in
truth
and
virtue
in
the
quiet
nooks
of
earth
tho
she
stands
erect
in
honor
when
the
heart
of
mankind
bleeds
still
she
hides
her
own
deserving
in
the
beauty
of
her
deeds
in
the
silence
of
the
darkness
where
no
eye
may
see
and
know
there
her
footsteps
shod
with
mercy
and
fleet
kindness
come
and
go
not
amid
the
sounds
of
plaudits
nor
before
the
garish
day
does
she
shed
her
soul
sweet
perfume
does
she
take
her
gentle
way
but
alike
her
ideal
flower
with
its
breath
still
her
heart
blooms
forth
its
beauty
in
the
valley
shades
of
death
encouraged
because
you
love
me
i
have
much
achieved
had
you
despised
me
then
i
must
have
failed
but
since
i
knew
you
trusted
and
believed
i
could
not
disappoint
you
and
so
prevailed
to
q
what
are
the
things
that
make
life
bright
a
star
gleam
in
the
night
what
hearts
us
for
the
coming
fray
the
dawn
tints
of
the
day
what
helps
to
speed
the
weary
mile
a
brother
friendly
smile
what
turns
o
gold
the
evening
gray
a
flower
beside
the
way
diplomacy
tell
your
love
where
the
roses
blow
and
the
hearts
of
the
lilies
quiver
not
in
the
city
gleam
and
glow
but
down
by
a
river
not
in
the
crowded
glare
that
would
be
fatal
marie
marie
how
can
she
answer
you
then
and
there
so
come
then

she
wrapped
her
soul
in

lace
of
lies
with
a

deceit

gaining

heart

hopes

trusts

doubts
and
fears
and
bleeds
and
burns
the

not

bye
my
little

bye
the
place
where
the
rainbow
ends
there
a
fabulous
story
full
of
splendor
and
glory
that
arabian
legends
transcends
of
the
wealth
without
measure
the
coffers
of
treasure
at
the
place
where
the
rainbow
ends
oh
many
have
sought
it
and
all
would
have
bought
it
with
the
blood
we
so
recklessly
spend
but
none
has
uncovered
the
gold
nor
discovered
the
spot
at
the
rainbow
end
they
have
sought
it
in
battle
and
where
the
rattle
of
dice
with
man
blasphemy
blends
but
persuasive
it
still
proves
evasive
this
place
where
the
rainbow
ends
i
own
for
my
pleasure
i
yearn
not
for
treasure
though
gold
has
a
power
it
lends
and
i
have
a
notion
to
find
without
motion
the
place
where
the
rainbow
ends
the
pot
may
hold
pottage
the
place
be
a
cottage
that
a
humble
contentment
defends
only
joy
fills
its
coffer
but
spite
of
the
scoffer
there
the
place
where
the
rainbow
ends
where
care
shall
be
quiet
and
love
shall
run
riot
and
i
shall
find
wealth
in
my
friends
then
truce
to
the
story
of
riches
and
glory
there
the
place
where
the
rainbow
ends

a

sat
i
a
a
golden
day
i
found
you
and
i
lost
you
all
on
a
gleaming
day
the
day
was
rilled
with
sunshine
and
the
land
was
full
of
may
a
golden
bird
was
singing
its
melody
divine
i
found
you
and
i
loved
you
and
all
the
world
was
mine
i
found
you
and
i
lost
you
all
on
a
golden
day
but
when
i
dream
of
you
dear
it
is
always
brimming
may
the
unlucky
apple
was
the
apple
that
in
eden
caused
our
father
primal
fall
and
the
trojan
war
remember
was
an
apple
caused
it
all
so
for
weeks
i
hesitated
you
can
guess
the
reason
why
for
i
want
to
tell
my
darling
she
the
apple
of
my
eye
the
discovery
these
are
the
days
of
elfs
and
fays
who
says
that
with
the
dreams
of
myth
these
imps
and
elves
disport
themselves
ah
no
along
the
paths
of
song
do
all
the
tiny
folk
belong
round
all
our
homes
kobolds
and
gnomes
do
daily
cling
then
nightly
fling
their
lanterns
out
and
shout
on
shout
they
join
the
rout
and
sing
and
sing
within
the
sweet
enchanted
ring
where
gleamed
the
guile
of
moonlight
smile
once
paused
i
listening
for
a
while
and
heard
the
lay
unknown
by
day
the
fairies
dancing
roundelay
queen
mab
was
there
her
shimmering
hair
each
fairy
prince
heart
despair
she
smiled
to
see
their
sparkling
glee
and
once
i
ween
she
smiled
at
me
since
when
you
may
by
night
or
day
dispute
the
sway
of
gay
but
hear
me
stay
i
learned
the
way
to
find
queen
mab
and
elf
and
fay
where
by
streams
the
moonlight
gleams
or
on
a
meadow
softly
beams
there
footing
round
on
ground
the
fairy
folk
may
all
be
found
morning
the
mist
has
left
the
greening
plain
the
shine
like
fairy
rain
the
coquette
rose
awakes
again
her
lovely
self
adorning
the
wind
is
hiding
in
the
trees
a
sighing
soothing
laughing
tease
until
the
rose
says
kiss
me
please
is
morning
is
morning
with
staff
in
hand
and
the
wanderer
fares
right
jauntily
for
towns
and
houses
are
thinks
he
for
scorning
for
scorning
my
soul
is
swift
upon
the
wing
and
in
its
deeps
a
song
i
bring
come
love
and
we
together
sing
is
morning
is
morning
the
awakening
i
did
not
know
that
life
could
be
so
sweet
i
did
not
know
the
hours
could
speed
so
fleet
till
i
knew
you
and
life
was
sweet
again
the
days
grew
brief
with
love
and
lack
of
pain
i
was
a
slave
a
few
short
days
ago
the
powers
of
kings
and
princes
now
i
know
i
would
not
be
again
in
bondage
save
i
had
your
smile
the
liberty
i
crave
love
draft
the
draft
of
love
was
cool
and
sweet
you
gave
me
in
the
cup
but
ah
love
fire
is
keen
and
fleet
and
i
am
burning
up
unless
the
tears
i
shed
for
you
shall
quench
this
burning
flame
it
will
consume
me
through
and
through
and
leave
but
ash
a
name
a
musical
outside
the
rain
upon
the
street
the
sky
all
grim
of
hue
inside
the
sweet
and
yet
i
heard
but
you

without

assured
it

and

went

till
on

learned
cupid
wandered
by
a

along

way
for
some
peculiar
butterfly
a
flash
of
wings
a
hurried
dive
a
flutter
and
a

this
scientist
as

had

deeply
because
i
had
loved

long
god
in
his
great
compassion
gave
me
the
gift
of
song
because
i
have
loved
so
vainly
and

which
here
surrounds

i
could

out
beyond
the
farthest
star
break
every
barrier
of
circumstance
that
bounds
me
and
greet
the
sun
of
sweeter
life
afar
tho
near
you
there
is
passion
grief
and
sorrow
and
out
there
rest
and
joy
and
peace
and
all
i
should
renounce
that
beckoning
for
i
could
not
choose
to
go
beyond
your
call
the
veteran
underneath
the
autumn
sky
haltingly
the
lines
go
by
ah
would
steps
were
blithe
and
gay
as
when
first
they
marched
away
smile
on
lip
and
curl
on
brow
only
now
standing
on
life
outer
verge
the
marches
sound
a
dirge
blow
you
bugles
play
you
fife
rattle
drums
for
dearest
life
let
the
flags
wave
freely
so
as
the
marching
legions
go
shout
hurrah
and
laugh
and
jest
this
is
memory
at
its
best
did
you
notice
at
your
quip
that
old
comrade
quivering
lip
ah
i
see
them
as
they
come
stumbling
with
the
rumbling
drum
but
a
sight
more
sad
to
me
than
these
ranks
could
be
was
that
one
with
cane
upraised
who
stood
by
and
gazed
and
gazed
trembling
solemn
lips
compressed
longing
to
be
with
the
rest
did
he
dream
of
old
alarms
as
he
stood
presented
arms
did
he
think
of
field
and
camp
and
the
unremitting
tramp
mile
on
mile
the
lonely
guard
when
he
kept
his
midnight
ward
did
he
dream
of
wounds
and
scars
in
that
bitter
war
of
wars
what
of
that
he
stood
and
stands
in
my
memory
trembling
hands
whitened
beard
and
cane
and
all
as
if
waiting
for
the
call
once
again
to
arms
my
sons
and
his
ears
hear
guns
roll
of
cannon
and
the
tread
of
the
legions
of
the
dead
yesterday
and
yesterday
i
held
your
hand
reverently
i
pressed
it
and
its
gentle
yieldingness
from
my
soul
i
blessed
it
but
i
sit
alone
sad
and
sore
repining
must
our
gold
forever
know
flames
for
the
refining
yesterday
i
walked
with
you
could
a
day
be
sweeter
life
was
all
a
lyric
song
set
to
tricksy
meter
ah
is
like
a
dirge
place
my
arms
around
you
let
me
feel
the
same
dear
joy
as
when
first
i
found
you
let
me
once
retrace
my
steps
from
these
roads
unpleasant
let
my
heart
and
mind
and
soul
all
ignore
the
present
yesterday
the
iron
seared
and
means
sorrow
pause
my
soul
arise
arise
look
where
gleams
the
morrow
the
change
love
used
to
carry
a
bow
you
know
but
now
he
carries
a
taper
it
is
either
a
length
of
wax
aglow
or
a
twist
of
lighted
paper
i
pondered
a
little
about
the
scamp
and
then
i
decided
to
follow
his
wandering
journey
to
field
and
camp
up
hill
down
dale
or
hollow
i
dogged
the
rollicking
gay
young
blade
in
every
species
of
weather
till
leading
me
straight
to
the
home
of
a
maid
he
left
us
there
together
and
then
i
saw
it
oh
sweet
surprise
the
taper
it
set
the
brimming
my
lady
eyes
and
my
heart
with
the
fire
of
yearning
the
chase
the
wind
told
the
little
leaves
to
hurry
and
chased
them
down
the
way
while
the
mother
tree
laughed
loud
in
glee
for
she
thought
her
babes
at
play
the
cruel
wind
and
the
rain
laughed
loudly
we
bury
them
deep
they
said
and
the
old
tree
grieves
and
the
little
leaves
lie
low
all
chilled
and
dead
suppose
if
fair
to
suppose
that
your
heart
were
not
taken
that
the
dew
from
the
rose
petals
still
were
not
shaken
i
should
pluck
you
you
should
thorn
me
and
scorn
me
and
wear
you
for
life
as
the
green
of
the
bower
if
fair
to
suppose
that
that
road
was
for
vagrants
that
the
wind
and
the
rose
counted
all
in
their
fragrance
oh
my
dear
one
by
love
i
should
take
you
and
make
you
the
green
of
my
life
from
the
scintillant
hour
the
death
of
the
first
born
cover
him
over
with
daisies
white
and
eke
with
the
poppies
red
sit
with
me
here
by
his
couch
for
the
love
is
dead
poor
little
fellow
he
seemed
so
fair
as
he
lay
in
my
jealous
arms
silent
and
cold
he
is
lying
there
stripped
of
his
darling
charms
lusty
and
strong
he
had
grown
forsooth
sweet
with
an
infinite
grace
proud
in
the
force
of
his
conquering
youth
laughter
alight
in
his
face
oh
but
the
blast
it
was
cruel
and
keen
and
ah
but
the
chill
it
was
rare
the
look
of
the
you
seen
when
meadows
and
fields
were
bare
can
you
not
wake
from
this
white
cold
sleep
and
speak
to
me
once
again
true
that
your
slumber
is
deep
so
deep
but
deeper
by
far
is
my
pain
cover
him
over
with
daisies
white
and
eke
with
the
poppies
red
sit
with
me
here
by
his
couch
for
the
love

a

in

and
all
the
dreams

come
flooding
back
to
me
the
past
has
writ
a
story
strange
upon
my
aching
heart
but
time
has
wrought
a
subtle
change
my
wounds
have
ceased
to
smart
no
more
the
quick
delight
of
youth
no
more
the
sudden
pain
i
look
no
more
for
trust
or
truth
where
greed
may
compass
gain
what
was
it
i
who
bared
my
heart
through
unrelenting
years
and
knew
the
sting
of
misery
dart
the
tang
of
sorrow
tears
is
better
now
i
do
not
weep
i
do
not
laugh
nor
care
my
soul
and
spirit
half
asleep
drift
aimless
everywhere
we
float
upon
a
sluggish
stream
we
ride
no
rapids
mad
while
life
is
all
a
tempered
dream
and
every
joy
half
sad
night
silence
and
whirling
worlds
afar
through
all
encircling
skies
what
floods
come
the
spirit
bar
what
wondrous
thoughts
arise
the
earth
a
mantle
falls
away
and
winged
we
leave
the
sod
where
shines
in
its
eternal
sway
the
majesty
of
god
at
since
i
left
the
city
heat
for
this
sylvan
cool
retreat
high
upon
the
here
where
the
air
is
clean
and
clear
i
have
lost
the
urban
ways
mine
are
calm
and
tranquil
days
sloping
lawns
of
green
are
mine
clustered
treasures
of
the
vine
long
forgotten
plants
i
know
where
the
best
wild
berries
grow
where
the
greens
and
grasses
sprout
when
the
elders
blossom
out
now
i
am
grown
with
the
lore
of
winds
and
skies
mine
the
song
whose
soft
refrain
is
the
sigh
of
summer
rain
seek
you
where
the
woods
are
cool
would
you
know
the
shady
pool
where
throughout
the
lazy
day
speckled
beauties
drowse
or
play
would
you
find
in
rest
or
peace
sorrow
permanent
release
leave
the
city
grim
and
gray
come
with
me
ah
come
away
do
you
fear
the
winter
chill
deeps
of
snow
upon
the
hill
is
a
mantle
kind
and
warm
shielding
tender
shoots
from
harm
do
you
dread
the
streams
they
are
mirrors
for
your
dreams
here
a
rouse
when
summer
past
to
the
raging
winter
blast
let
him
roar
and
let
him
rout
we
are
armored
for
the
bout
how
the
logs
are
glowing
see
who
sings
louder
they
or
he
could
the
city
be
more
gay
burn
your
bridges
come
away
when
a
feller
itchin
to
be
spanked
us
fellers
stomp
around
makin
lots
o
noise
gramma

times

wen
a
feller
itchin

spanked
the
river
of
ruin
along
by
the
river
of
ruin
they
dally
the
thoughtless
ones
they
dance
and
they
dream
by
the
side
of
the
stream
as
long
as
the
river
runs
it
seems
all
so
pleasant
and
cheery
no
thought
of
the
morrow
is
theirs
and
their
faces
are
bright
with
the
sun
of
delight
and
they
dream
of
no
cares
the
women
wear
garlanded
tresses
the
men
have
rings
on
their
hands
and
they
sing
in
their
glee
for
they
think
they
are
free
they
that
know
not
the
treacherous
sands
ah
but
this
be
a
venturesome
journey
forever
those
sands
are
ashift
and
a
step
to
one
side
means
a
grasp
of
the
tide
and
the
current
is
fearful
and
swift
for
once
in
the
river
of
ruin
what
boots
it
to
do
or
to
dare
for
down
we
must
go
in
the
turbulent
flow
to
the
desolate
sea
of
despair
to
her
your
presence
like
a
benison
to
me
wakes
my
sick
soul
to
dreamful
ecstasy
i
fancy
that
some
old
arabian
night
saw
you
my
houri
and
my
heart
delight
and
wandering
forth
beneath
the
passionate
moon
your
zither
and
my
soul
in
tune
we
knew
the
joy
the
haunting
of
the
pain
that
like
a
flame
thrills
through
me
now
again
we
sit
where
sweet
the
spice
winds
blow
a
wind
the
northland
lacks
and
shall
know
with
clasped
hands
and
spirits
all
aglow

my
after
many
days
i
always
been
a
faithful
man
an
tried
to
live
for
duty
but
the
stringent
mode
of
life
has
somewhat
lost
its
beauty
the
story
of
the
generous
bread
he
sent
upon
the
waters
which
after
many
days
returns
to
trusting
sons
and
daughters
had
oft
impressed
me
so
i
want
my
soul
influenced
by
it
and
bought
a
loaf
of
bread
and
sought
a
stream
where
i
could
try
it
i
cast
my
bread
upon
the
waves
and
fancied
then
to
await
it
it
had
not
floated
far
away
when
a
fish
came
up
and
ate
it
and
if
i
want
both
fish
and
bread
and
surely
both
i
wanting
about
the
only
way
i
see
is
for
me
to
go
fishing
liza
may
little
brown
face
full
of
smiles
and
a
baby
guileless
wiles
liza
may
liza
may
eyes
thro
the
fence
with
an
interest
intense
liza
may
ah
the
gate
is
just
ajar
and
the
meadow
is
not
far
liza
may
liza
may
and
the
road
feels
very
sweet
to
your
little
toddling
feet
liza
may
ah
you
roguish
runaway
what
will
toiling
mother
say
liza
may
liza
may
what
care
you
who
smile
to
greet
everyone
you
chance
to
meet
liza
may
soft
the
sings
its
song
just
a
little
way
along
liza
may
liza
may
but
the
song
is
full
of
guile
turn
ah
turn
your
steps
the
while
liza
may
you
have
caught
the
gleam
and
glow
where
the
darkling
waters
flow
liza
may
liza
may
flash
of
ripple
bend
of
bough
where
are
all
the
angels
now
liza
may
now
a
mother
eyes
intense
gazing
a
shabby
fence
liza
may
liza
may
then
a
mother
anguished
face
peering
all
around
the
place
liza
may
hear
the
agonizing
call
for
a
mother
all
in
all
liza
may
liza
may
hear
a
mother
maddened
prayer
to
the
calm
unanswering
air
liza
may
what
become
of
liza
may
what
has
darkened
all
the
day
liza
may
liza
may
ask
the
waters
dark
and
fleet
if
they
know
the
smiling
sweet
liza
may
call
her
call
her
as
you
will
on
the
meadow
on
the
hill
liza
may
liza
may
through
the
brush
or
beaten
track
echo
only
gives
you
back
liza
may
ah
but
you
were
loving
sweet
on
your
little
toddling
feet
liza
may
liza
may
but
through
all
the
coming
years
must
a
mother
breathe
with
tears
liza

the
masters
oh
who
is
the
lord
of
the
land
of
life
when
hotly
goes
the
fray

fierce
we
smile
in
the
midst
of
strife
then
whom
shall
we
obey
oh
love

the
lord
of
the
land

both
around
blushing
the
stream
of
petal
beauty
flows
softly
the
white
strings
trickle
down
and
shine
oh
speak
to
me
my
love
i
crave
a
rose
sing
me
a
song
for
i
would
pearls
were
mine
the
rain
streams
down
like
from
the
sky
the
wind
that
harpist
sitteth
by
and
ever
as
he
sings
his
low
refrain
he
plays
upon
the
of
the
rain
a
lost
dream
ah
i
have
changed
i
do
not
know
why
lonely
hours
affect
me
so
in
days
of
yore
this
were
not
wont
no
loneliness
my
soul
could
daunt
for
me
too
serious
for
my
age
the
weighty
tome
of
hoary
sage
until
with
puzzled
heart
astir
one
night
i
dreamed
of
her
i
loved
no
woman
hardly
knew
more
of
the
sex
that
strong
men
woo
than
cloistered
monk
within
his
cell
but
now
the
dream
is
lost
and
hell
holds
me
her
captive
tight
and
fast
who
prays
and
struggles
for
the
past
no
living
maid
has
charmed
my
eyes
but
now
my
soul
is
for
i
have
dreamed
of
her
and
seen
her
tresses
ruddy
sheen
have
known
her
sweetness
lip
to
lip
the
joy
of
her
companionship
when
days
were
bleak
and
winds
were
rude
she
shared
my
smiling
solitude
and
all
the
bare
hills
walked
with
me
to
hearken
winter
melody
and
when
the
spring
came
the
land
we
fared
together
hand
in
hand
beneath
the
linden
leafy
screen
that
waved
above
us
faintly
green
in
summer
by
the
our
souls
were
kindred
with
the
tide
that
floated
onward
to
the
sea
as
we
swept
toward
eternity
the
bird
call
and
the
water
drone
were
all
for
us
and
us
alone
the
that
sang
all
night
was
her
companion
my
delight
and
the
squirrel
as
he
sped
along
the
branches
overhead
half
kindly
and
half
envious
would
chatter
at
the
joy
of
us
was
but
a
dream
her
face
her
hair
the
sweet
the
winter
bare
the
summer
when
the
woods
we
ranged
was
but
a
dream
but
all
is
changed
yes
all
is
changed
and
all
has
fled
the
dream
is
broken
shattered
dead
and
yet
sometimes
i
pray
to
know
how
just
a
dream
could
hold
me
so
a
song
thou
art
the
soul
of
a
summer
day
thou
art
the
breath
of
the
rose
but
the
summer
is
fled
and
the
rose
is
dead
where
are
they
gone
who
knows
who
knows
thou
art
the
blood
of
my
heart
o
hearts
thou
art
my
soul
repose
but
my
heart
grows
numb
and
my
soul
is
dumb
where
art
thou
love
who
knows
who
knows
thou
art
the
hope
of
my
after
years
sun
for
my
winter
snows
but
the
years
go
by
a
clouded
sky
where

then
you

sir
the
spring
was
here

and
many
bards
did
flute
sir
i
shall
not
fear
a
little
snow
forbid
me
from
my
lute
sir
if
words
grow
dull
and
rhymes
grow
rare
i
sing
of
spring
farewell
sir
for
every
season
steals
an
air
which
has
a
springtime
smell
sir
but
if
upon
the
other
side
with
passionate
longing
burning
will
seek
the
half
unjeweled
tide
and
sing
of
spring
returning
from
the
porch
at
runnymede
i
stand
above
the
city
rush
and
din
and
gaze
far
down
with
calm
and
undimmed
eyes
to
where
the
misty
smoke
wreath
grey
and
dim
above
the
myriad
roofs
and
spires
rise
still
is
my
heart
and
vacant
is
my
breath
this
lovely
view
is
breath
and
life
to
me
why
i
could
charm
the
icy
soul
of
death
with
such
a
sight
as
this
i
stand
and
see
i
hear
no
sound
of
labor
din
or
stir
i
feel
no
weight
of
worldly
cares
or
fears
sweet
song
of
birds
of
wings
the
soothing
whirr
these
sounds
alone
assail
my
listening
ears
unwhipt
of
conscience
here
i
stand
alone
the
breezes
humbly
kiss
my
garment
hem
i
am
a
king
the
whole
world
is
my
throne
the
blue
grey
sky
my
royal
diadem
equipment
with
what
thou
gavest
me
o
master
i
have
wrought
such
chances
such
abilities
to
see
the
end
was
not
for
my
poor
eyes
thine
was
the
impulse
thine
the
forming
thought
ah
i
have
wrought
and
these
sad
hands
have
right
to
tell
their
story
it
was
no
hard
up
striving
after
glory
catching
and
losing
gaining
and
failing
raging
me
back
at
the
world
raucous
railing
simply
and
humbly
from
stone
and
from
wood
wrought
i
the
things
that
to
thee
might
seem
good
if
they
are
little
ah
god
but
the
cost
who
but
thou

the
all
that
is
lost

they

true
try
them

me
be
my
due
evening
the
moon
begins
her
stately
ride
across
the
summer
sky
the
happy
wavelets
lash
the
shore
the
tide
is
rising
high
beneath
some
friendly
blade
of
grass
the
lazy
beetle
cowers
the
coffers
of
the
air
are
filled
with
offerings
from
the
flowers
and
slowly
buzzing
my
head
a
swallow
wings
her
flight
i
hear
the
weary
plowman
sing
as
falls
the
restful
night
to
pfrimmer
lines
on
reading
driftwood
driftwood
gathered
here
and
there
along
the
beach
of
time
now
and
then
a
chip
of
truth
boards
and
boughs
of
rhyme
driftwood
gathered
day
by
day
the
cypress
and
the
oak
twigs
that
in
some
former
time
from
sturdy
home
trees
broke
did
this
wood
come
floating
thick
all
along
down
injin
crik
or
did
kind
tides
bring
it
thee
from
the
past
receding
sea
down
the
stream
of
memory
to
the
miami
kiss
me
miami
thou
most
constant
one
i
love
thee
more
for
that
thou
changest
not
when
winter
comes
with
frigid
blast
or
when
the
blithesome
spring
is
past
and
summer
here
with
sunshine
hot
or
in
sere
autumn
thou
has
still
the
to
charm
alike
the
hour
kiss
me
miami
with
thy
dewy
lips
throbs
fast
my
heart
as
thine
own
breast
beats
my
soul
doth
rise
as
rise
thy
waves
as
each
on
each
the
dark
shore
laves
and
breaks
in
ripples
and
retreats
there
is
a
poem
in
thine
every
phase
thou
still
has
sung
through
all
thy
days
tell
me
miami
how
it
was
with
thee
when
years
ago
tecumseh
in
his
prime
his
birch
boat
thy
waters
sent
and
pitched
upon
thy
banks
his
tent
in
that
poetic
time
did
some
bronze
bard
thy
flowing
stream
sit
by
and
sing
thy
praises
as
i
did
some
bronze
lover
this
dark
old
tree
whisper
of
love
unto
his
indian
maid
and
didst
thou
list
his
murmurs
deep
and
in
thy
bosom
safely
keep
the
many
raging
vows
they
said
or
didst
thou
tell
to
fish
and
frog
and
bird
the
raptured
scenes
that
there
occurred
but
o
dear
stream
what
volumes
thou
couldst
tell
to
all
who
know
thy
language
as
i
do
of
life
and
love
and
jealous
hate
but
now
to
tattle
were
too
late
thou
who
hast
ever
been
so
true
tell
not
to
every
passing
idler
here
all
those
sweet
tales
that
reached
thine
ear
but
silent
stream
speak
out
and
tell
me
this
i
say
that
men
and
things
are
still
the
same
were
men
as
bold
to
do
and
dare
were
women
then
as
true
and
fair
did
poets
seek
celestial
flame
the
hero
die
to
gain
a
laureled
brow
and
women
suffer
then
as
now
christmas
carol
ring
out
ye
bells
all
nature
swells
with
gladness
at
the
wondrous
story
the
world
was
lorn
but
christ
is
born
to
change
our
sadness
into
glory
sing
earthlings
sing
a
king
hath
come
from
heaven
high
throne
to
bless
us
the
outstretched
hand
all
the
land
is
raised
in
pity
to
caress
us
come
at
his
call
be
joyful
all
away
with
mourning
and
with
sadness
the
heavenly
choir
with
holy
fire
their
voices
raise
in
songs
of
gladness
the
darkness
breaks
and
dawn
awakes
her
cheeks
suffused
with
youthful
blushes
the
rocks
and
stones
in
holy
tones
are
singing
sweeter
than
the
thrushes
then
why
should
we
in
silence
be
when
nature
lends
her
voice
to
praises
when
heaven
and
earth
proclaim
the
truth
of
him
for
whom
that
lone
star
blazes
no
be
not
still
but
with
a
will
strike
all
your
harps
and
set
them
ringing
on

i
let

my
patience
an
git
cross
in
summer
time
when
summer
time
has
come
and
all
the
world
is
in
the
magic
thrall
of
perfumed
airs
that
lull
each
sense
to
fits
of
drowsy
indolence
when
skies
are
deepest
blue
above
and
aflush
then
most
i
love
to
start
while
early
dews
are
damp
and
wend
my
way
in
woodland
tramp
where
forests
rustle
tree
on
tree
and
sing
their
silent
songs
to
me
where
pathways
meet
and
path
ways
part
to
walk
with
nature
heart
by
heart
till
wearied
out
at
last
i
lie
where
some
sweet
stream
steals
singing
by
a
mossy
bank
where
violets
vie
in
color
with
the
summer
sky
or
take
my
rod
and
line
and
hook
and
wander
to
some
darkling
brook
where
all
day
long
the
willows
dream
and
idly
droop
to
kiss
the
stream
and
there
to
loll
from
morn
till
night
unheeding
nibble
run
or
bite
just
for
the
joy
of
being
there
and
drinking
in
the
summer
air
the
summer
sounds
and
summer
sights
that
set
a
restless
mind
to
rights
when
grief
and
pain
and
raging
doubt
of
men
and
creeds
have
worn
it
out
the
birds
song
and
the
water
drone
the
humming
bees
low
monotone
the
murmur
of
the
passing
breeze
and
all
the
sounds
akin
to
these
that
make
a
man
in
summer
time
feel
only
fit
for
rest
and
rhyme
joy
springs
all
radiant
in
my
breast
though
pauper
poor
than
king
more
blest
the
tide
beats
in
my
soul
so
strong
that
happiness
breaks
forth
in
song
and
rings
aloud
the
welkin
blue
with
all
the
songs
i
ever
knew
o
time
of
rapture
time
of
song
how
swiftly
glide
thy
days
along
adown
the
current
of
the
years
above
the
rocks
of
grief
and
tears
is
wealth
enough
of
joy
for
me
in
summer
time
to
simply
be
a
thanksgiving
poem
the
sun
hath
shed
its
kindly
light
our
harvesting
is
gladly
our
fields
have
felt
no
killing
blight
our
bins
are
filled
with
goodly
store
from
pestilence
fire
flood
and
sword
we
have
been
spared
by
thy
decree
and
now
with
humble
hearts
o
lord
we
come
to
pay
our
thanks
to
thee
we
feel
that
had
our
merits
been
the
measure
of
thy
gifts
to
us
we
erring
children
born
of
sin
might
not
now
be
rejoicing
thus
no
deed
of
ours
hath
brought
us
grace
when
thou
were
nigh
our
sight
was
dull
we
hid
in
trembling
from
thy
face
but
thou
o
god
wert
merciful
thy
mighty
hand
all
the
land
hath
still
been
open
to
bestow
those
blessings
which
our
wants
demand
from
heaven
whence
all
blessings
flow
thou
hast
with
ever
watchful
eye
looked
down
on
us
with
holy
care
and
from
thy
storehouse
in
the
sky
hast
scattered
plenty
everywhere
then
lift
we
up
our
songs
of
praise
to
thee
o
father
good
and
kind
to
thee
we
consecrate
our
days
be
thine
the
temple
of
each
mind
with
incense
sweet
our
thanks
ascend
before
thy
works
our
powers
pall
though
we
should
strive
years
without
end
we
could
not
thank
thee
for
them
all
nutting
song
the
november
sun
invites
me
and
although
the
chill
wind
smites
me
i
will
wander
to
the
woodland
where
the
laden
trees
await
and
with
loud
and
joyful
singing
i
will
set
the
forest
ringing
as
if
i
were
king
of
autumn
and
dame
nature
were
my
mate
while
the
squirrel
in
his
gambols
fearless
round
about
me
ambles
as
if
he
were
bent
on
showing
in
my
kingdom
he
a
share
while
my
warm
blood
leaps
and
dashes
and
my
eye
with
freedom
flashes
as
my
soul
drinks
deep
and
deeper
of
the
magic
in
the
air
there
a
pleasure
found
in
nutting
all
life
cares
and
griefs
outshutting
that
is
fuller
far
and
better
than
what
prouder
sports
impart
who
could
help
a
carol
trilling
as
he
sees
the
baskets
filling
why
the
flow
of
song
keeps
running
the
high
walls
of
the
heart
so
when
i
am
home
returning
when
the
sun
is
lowly
burning
i
will
once
more
wake
the
echoes
with
a
happy
song
of
praise
for
the
golden
sunlight
blessing
and
the
breezes
soft
caressing
and
the
precious
boon
of
living
in
the
sweet
november
days
love
pictures
like
the
blush
upon
the
rose
when
the
wooing
south
wind
speaks
kissing
soft
its
petals
are
thy
cheeks
tender
soft
beseeching
true
like
the
stars
that
deck
the
skies
through
the
ether
sparkling
are
thine
eyes
like
the
song
of
happy
birds
when
the
woods
with
spring
rejoice
in
their
blithe
is
thy
voice
like
soft
threads
of
clustered
silk
thy
face
so
pure
and
fair
sweet
in
its
profusion
is
thy
hair
like
a
fair
but
fragile
vase
triumph
of
the
carver
art
graceful
formed
and
slender
thus
thou
art
ah
thy
cheek
thine
eyes
thy
voice
and
thy
hair
delightful
wave
make
me
i
confess
it
thy
poor
slave
the
old
homestead
is
an
old
deserted
homestead
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
where
the
roof
is
all
and
the
walls
are
tumbling
down
but
around
that
little
cottage
do
my
brightest
cling
for
was
there
i
spent
the
moments
of
my
youth
life
happy
spring
i
remember
how
i
used
to
swing
upon
the
old
front
gate
while
the
robin
in
the
tree
tops
sung
a
night
song
to
his
mate
and
how
later
in
the
evening
as
the
beaux
were
wont
to
do
perkins
in
the
parlor
sat
and
sparked
my
sister
sue
there
my
mother
heaven
bless
her
kissed
or
spanked
as
was
our
need
and
by
smile
or
stroke
implanted
in
our
hearts
fair
virtue
seed
while
my
father
man
of
wisdom
lawyer
keen
and
farmer
stout
argued
long
with
neighbor
dobbins
how
the
corn
crops
would
turn
out
then
the
quiltings
and
the
dances
how
my
feet
were
wont
to
fly
while
the
moon
peeped
through
the
barn
chinks
from
her
stately
place
on
high
oh
those
days
so
sweet
so
happy
ever
backward
me
roll
still
the
music
of
that
farm
life
rings
an
echo
in
my
soul
now
the
old
place
is
deserted
and
the
walls
are
falling
down
all
who
made
the
home
life
cheerful
now
have
died
or
moved
to
town
but
about
that
dear
old
cottage
shall
my
ever
cling
for
was
there
i
spent
the
moments
of
my
youth
life
happy
spring
on
the
death
of
thou
arrant
robber
death
couldst
thou
not
find
some
lesser
one
than
he
to
rob
of
breath
some
poorer
mind
thy
prey
to
be
his
mind
was
like
the
sky
as
pure
and
free
his
heart
was
broad
and
open
as
the
sea
his
soul
shone
purely
through
his
face
and
love
made
him
her
dwelling
place
not
less
the
scholar
than
the
friend
not
less
a
friend
than
man
the
manly
life
did
shorter
end
because
so
broad
it
ran
weep
not
for
him
unhappy
muse
his
merits
found
a
grander
use
some
god
wisely
sees
the
place
that
needs
his
qualities
weep
not
for
him
for
when
death
lowers
youth
bowers
he
only
plucks
the
choicest
flowers
an
old
memory
how
sweet
the
music
sounded
that
summer
long
ago
when
you
were
by
my
side
love
to
list
its
gentle
flow
i
saw
your
eyes
i
felt
your
rippling
hair
i
kissed
your
pearly
cheek
love
and
had
no
thought
of
care
and
gay
or
sad
the
music
with
subtle
charm
replete
i
found
in
after
years
love
was
you
that
made
it
sweet
for
standing
where
we
heard
it
i
hear
again
the
strain
it
wakes
my
heart
but
thrills
it
with
sad
mysterious
pain
it
pulses
not
so
joyous
as
when
you
stood
with
me
and
hand
in
hand
we
listened
to
that
low
melody
oh
could
the
years
turn
back
love
oh
could
events
be
changed
to
what
they
were
that
time
love
before
we
were
estranged
wert
thou
once
more
a
maiden
whose
smile
was
gold
to
me
were
i
once
more
the
lover
whose
word
was
life
to
thee
o
god
could
all
be
altered
the
pain
the
grief
the
strife
and
wert
thou
as
thou
shouldst
be
my
true
and
loyal
wife
but
all
my
tears
are
idle
and
all
my
wishes
vain
what
once
you
were
to
me
love
you
may
not
be
again
for
i
alas
like
others
have
missed
my
dearest
aim
i
asked
for
love
oh
mockery
fate
comes
to
me
with
fame
a
career
break
me
my
bounds
and
let
me
fly
to
regions
vast
of
boundless
sky
nor
i
like
piteous
daphne
be
ah
no
i
would
be
free
as
yon
same
bird
that
in
its
flight
outstrips
the
range
of
mortal
sight
free
as
the
mountain
streams
that
gush
from
bubbling
springs
and
downward
rush
across
the
serrate
mountain
side
the
rocks
their
banks
defied
and
like
the
passions
in
the
soul
swell
into
torrents
as
they
roll
oh
circumscribe
me
not
by
rules
that
serve
to
lead
the
minds
of
fools
but
give
me
to
work
my
will
and
at
my
deeds
the
world
shall
thrill
my
words
shall
rouse
the
zest
that
hardly
stirs
in
manhood
breast
and
as
the
sun
feeds
lesser
lights
as
planets
have
their
satellites
so
round
about
me
will
i
bind
the
men
who
prize
a
master
mind
he
lived
a
silent
life
alone
and
laid
him
down
when
it
was
done
and
at
his
head
was
placed
a
stone
on
which
was
carved
a
name
unknown
on
the
river
the
sun
is
low
the
waters
flow
my
boat
is
dancing
to
and
fro
the
eve
is
still
yet
from
the
hill
the
killdeer
echoes
loud
and
shrill
the
paddles
plash
the
wavelets
dash
we
see
the
summer
lightning
flash
while
now
and
then
in
marsh
and
fen
too
muddy
for
the
feet
of
men
where
neither
bird
nor
beast
has
stirred
the
spotted
bullfrog
croak
is
heard
the
wind
is
high
the
grasses
sigh
the
sluggish
stream
goes
sobbing
by
and
far
away
the
dying
day
has
cast
its
last
effulgent
ray
while
on
the
land
the
shadows
stand
proclaiming
that
the
eve
at
hand
poor
withered
rose
poor
withered
rose
she
gave
it
me
half
in
revenge
and
half
in
glee
its
petals
not
so
pink
by
half
as
are
her
lips
when
curled
to
laugh
as
are
her
cheeks
when
dimples
gay
in
merry
mischief
them
play
forgive
forgive
it
seems
unkind
to
cast
thy
petals
to
the
wind
but
it
is
right
and
lest
i
err
so
scatter
i
all
thought
of
her
poor
withered
rose
so
like
my
heart
that
wilts
at
sorrow
cruel
dart
who
hath
not
felt
the
winter
blight
when
every
hope
seemed
warm
and
bright
who
doth
not
know
love
unreturned
when
the
heart
most
wildly
burned
poor
withered
rose
thou
liest
dead
too
soon
thy
beauty
bloom
hath
fled
is
not
without
a
tearful
ruth
i
watch
decay
thy
blushing
youth
and
though
thy
life
goes
out
in
dole
thy
perfume
lingers
in
my
soul
worn
out
you
bid
me
hold
my
peace
and
dry
my
fruitless
tears
forgetting
that
i
bear
a
pain
beyond
my
years
you
say
that
i
should
smile
and
drive
the
gloom
away
i
would
but
sun
and
smiles
have
left
my
life
dark
day
all
time
seems
cold
and
void
and
naught
but
tears
remain
life
music
beats
for
me
a
melancholy
strain
i
used
at
first
to
hope
but
hope
is
past
and
gone
and
now
without
a
ray
my
cheerless
life
drags
on
like
to
an
hearth
when
all
its
fires
are
spent
like
to
an
autumn
wood
by
storm
winds
rudely
shent
so
sadly
goes
my
heart
unclothed
of
hope
and
peace
it
asks
not
joy
again
but
only
seeks
release
james
whitcomb
riley
from
a
westerner
point
of
view
no
matter
what
you
call
it
whether
genius
or
art
he
sings
the
simple
songs
that
come
the
closest
to
your
heart
fur
trim
an
skillful
phrases
i
do
not
keer
a
jot
the
words
alone
but
feelin
that
tech
the
tender
spot
an
that
jest
why
i
love
him
why
he
got
sech
human
feelin
an
in
song
he
gives
us
you
kin
see
it
creepin
stealin
through
the
core
the
tears
go
tricklin
but
the
edge
is
bright
an
smiley
i
never
saw
a
poet
like
that
poet
whitcomb
riley
his
heart
keeps
beatin
time
with
in
measures
fast
or
slow
he
tells
us
jest
the
same
ol
things
our
souls
have
learned
to
know
he
paints
our
joys
an
sorrers
in
a
way
so
true
that
a
body
ca
help
that
he
has
felt
them
too
if
there
a
lesson
to
be
taught
he
never
fears
to
teach
it
an
he
puts
the
food
so
good
an
low
that
the
humblest
one
kin
reach
it
now
in
our
time
when
poets
rhyme
for
money
fun
or
fashion
is
good
to
hear
one
voice
so
clear
that
thrills
with
honest
passion
so
let
the
others
build
their
songs
an
strive
to
polish
highly
there
none
of
them
kin
tech
the
heart
like
our
own
whitcomb
riley
a
madrigal
dream
days
of
fond
delight
and
hours
as
as
dawn
are
mine
love
drowsy
wine
brewed
from
the
heart
of
passion
flowers
flows
softly
my
lips
and
save
thee
all
the
world
is
in
eclipse
there
were
no
light
if
thou
wert
not
the
sun
would
be
too
sad
to
shine
and
all
the
line
of
hours
from
dawn
would
be
a
blot
and
night
would
haunt
the
skies
an
unlaid
ghost
with
staring
eyes
oh
love
if
thou
wert
not
my
love
and
i
perchance
not
thine
what
then
could
gift
of
men
or
favor
of
the
god
above
plant
aught
in
this
bare
heart
or
teach
this
tongue
the
singer
soulful
art
ah
no
is
love
and
love
alone
that
spurs
my
soul
so
surely
on
turns
night
to
dawn
and
thorns
to
roses
fairest
blown
and
winter
drear
to
spring
oh
were
it
not
for
love
i
could
not
sing
a
starry
night
a
cloud
fell
down
from
the
heavens
and
broke
on
the
mountain
brow
it
scattered
the
dusky
fragments
all
over
the
vale
below
the
moon
and
the
stars
were
anxious
to
know
what
its
fate
might
be
so
they
rushed
to
the
azure
and
all
peered
down
to
see
a
lyric
my
lady
love
lives
far
away
and
oh
my
heart
is
sad
by
day
and
ah
my
tears
fall
fast
by
night
what
may
i
do
in
such
a
plight
why
miles
grow
few
when
love
is
fleet
and
love
you
know
hath
flying
feet
break
off
thy
sighs
and
witness
this
how
poor
a
thing
mere
distance
is
my
love
knows
not
i
love
her
so
and
would
she
scorn
me
did
she
know
how
may
the
tale
i
would
impart
attract
her
ear
and
storm
her
heart
calm
thou
the
tempest
in
my
breast
who
loves
in
silence
loves
the
best
but
bide
thy
time
she
will
awake
no
night
so
dark
but
morn
will
break
but
though
my
heart
so
strongly
yearn
my
lady
loves
me
not
in
turn
how
may
i
win
the
blest
reply
that
my
void
heart
shall
satisfy
love
breedeth
love
be
thou
but
true
and
soon
thy
love
shall
love
thee
too
if
fate
hath
meant
you
heart
for
heart
there
naught
may
keep
you
twain
apart
how
shall
i
woo
thee
how
shall
i
woo
thee
to
win
thee
mine
own
say
in
what
tongue
shall
i
tell
of
my
love
i
who
was
fearless
so
timid
have
grown
all
that
was
eagle
has
turned
into
dove
the
path
from
the
meadow
that
leads
to
the
bars
is
more
to
me
now
than
the
path
of
the
stars
how
shall
i
woo
thee
to
win
thee
mine
own
thou
who
art
fair
and
as
far
as
the
moon
had
i
the
strength
of
the
torrent
wild
tone
had
i
the
sweetness
of
warblers
in

the
strength
and
the
sweetness
might
charm
and
persuade
but
neither
have
i
my
petition
to
aid
how
shall
i
woo
thee
to
win
thee
mine
own
how
shall
i
traverse
the
distance
between
my
humble
cot
and
your
glorious
throne
how
shall
a
clown
gain
the
ear
of
a
queen
oh
teach
me
the
tongue
that

transcriber
notes
many
contractions
which
would
normally
be
printed
together
in
their
shortened
form
are
left
spaced
as
printed
sometimes
this
is
done
due
to
the
meter
of
the
poem
other
times
it
is
just
the
older
way
that
printers
handled
these
words
the
original
was
not
always
consistent
about
how
these
were
handled
and
may
have
been
contracted
to
save
space
since
this
book
has
a
significant
amount
of
dialect
no
attempt
was
made
to
change
any
odd
spellings
some
of
these
words
are
not
easy
to
but
usually
the
context
will
be
sufficient
for
instance
the
word
means
stirs
as
melody
stuhs
me
up
