the

by

chapter
fearless
frank
to
the
rescue
on
the
plains
midway
between
cheyenne
and
the
black
hills
a
train
had
halted
for
a
noonday
feed
not
a
railway
train
mind
you
but
a
line
of
those
vehicles
drawn
by
mules
which
are
most
properly
styled
prairie
schooners
there
were
four
wagons
of
this
type
and
they
had
been
drawn
in
a
circle
about
a
over
which
was
roasting
a
savory
haunch
of
venison
around
the
were
grouped
half
a
score
of
men
all
rough
bearded
and
grizzled
with
one
exception
this
being
a
youth
whose
age
one
could
have
safely
put
at
twenty
so
perfectly
developed
of
physique
and
intelligent
of
facial
appearance
was
he
there
was
something
about
him
that
was
not
handsome
and
yet
you
would
have
been
puzzled
to
tell
what
it
was
for
his
countenance
was
strikingly
handsome
and
surely
no
form
in
the
crowd
was
more
noticeable
for
its
grace
symmetry
and
proportionate
development
it
would
have
taken
a
scholar
to
have
studied
out
the
secret
he
was
of
about
medium
stature
and
as
straight
and
as
an
athlete
his
complexion
was
from
long
exposure
to
the
sun
hair
of
hue
of
the
raven
wing
and
hanging
in
long
straight
strands
adown
his
back
eyes
black
and
piercing
as
an
eagle
features
well
molded
with
a
firm
resolute
mouth
and
prominent
chin
he
was
an
interesting
specimen
of
young
healthy
manhood
and
even
though
a
youth
in
years
was
one
that
could
command
respect
if
not
admiration
wheresoever
he
might
choose
to
go
one
remarkable
item
about
his
personal
appearance
apt
to
strike
the
beholder
as
being
exceedingly
strange
and
eccentric
was
his
costume
throughout
and
that
dyed
to
the
brightest
scarlet
hue
on
being
asked
the
cause
of
his
odd
freak
of
dress
when
he
had
joined
the
train
a
few
miles
out
from
cheyenne
the
youth
had
laughingly
replied
why
you
see
it
is
to
attract
bufflers
if
we
should
meet
any
out
on
the
plains
this
and
the
hills
he
gave
his
name
as
fearless
frank
and
said
he
was
aiming
for
the
hills
that
if
the
party
in
question
would
furnish
him
a
place
among
them
he
would
extend
to
them
his
assistance
as
a
hunter
guide
or
whatever
until
the
destination
was
reached
seeing
that
he
was
well
armed
and
judging
from
external
appearances
that
he
would
prove
a
valuable
accessory
the
miners
were
nothing
loth
in
accepting
his
services
of
the
others
grouped
about
the
only
one
is
specially
noticeable
for
as
mark
twain
remarks
the
average
of
look
alike
this
person
was
a
little
deformed
old
man
and
with
cross
eyes
a
large
mouth
a
big
head
set
upon
a
slim
neck
blue
eyes
and
an
immense
brown
beard
that
flowed
downward
to
the
belt
about
his
waist
which
contained
a
small
arsenal
of
knives
and
revolvers
he
hobbled
about
with
a
heavy
crutch
constantly
under
his
left
arm
and
was
certainly
a
pitiable
sight
to
behold
he
too
had
joined
the
caravan
after
it
had
quitted
cheyenne
his
advent
taking
place
about
an
hour
subsequent
to
that
of
fearless
frank
his
name
he
asserted
was
nix
geoffrey
walsingham
nix
and
where
he
came
from
and
what
he
sought
in
the
black
hills
was
simply
a
matter
of
conjecture
among
the
miners
as
he
refused
to
talk
on
the
subject
of
his
past
present
or
future
the
train
was
under
the
command
of
an
irascible
old
plainsman
who
had
served
out
his
apprenticeship
in
the
kansas
border
war
and
whose
name
was
charity
joe
which
considering
his
avaricious
disposition
was
the
wrong
handle
on
the
wrong
man
charity
was
the
least
of
all
old
joe
redeeming
characteristics
charity
was
the
very
thing
he
did
not
recognize
yet
some
wag
had
facetiously
branded
him
charity
joe
and
the
appellation
had
clung
to
him
ever
since
he
was
well
advanced
in
years
yet
withal
a
good
trailer
and
an
expert
guide
as
the
success
of
his
many
late
expeditions
into
the
black
hills
had
evidenced
those
who
had
heard
of
joe
skill
as
a
guide
intrusted
themselves
in
his
care
for
while
the
stages
were
stopped
more
or
less
on
each
trip
charity
joe
train
invariably
went
through
all
safe
and
sound
this
was
partly
owing
to
his
acquaintance
with
various
bands
of
indians
who
were
the
chief
cause
of
annoyance
on
the
trip
so
far
we
see
the
train
toward
the
land
of
gold
without
their
having
seen
sight
or
sound
of
hostile
and
charity
is
just
chuckling
over
his
usual
good
luck

i

it

to
me
that

butchering
lately
than
there
was
a
month
ago
all
on
account
of
the
influx
of
ruffianly
characters
into

to

it
by
very
large

all

to

his

and
the
noonday
meal
was
dispatched
in
silence
after
each
man
had
fully
satisfied
his
appetite
and
the
mules

had
grazed
until
they
were
full
as

the
order
was
given
to

up
which
was
speedily
done
and
the
caravan
was
soon
in
motion
toiling
along
like
a
diminutive
serpent
across
the
plain
the
afternoon
was
a
mild
sunny
one
in
early
autumn
with
a
refreshing
breeze
perfumed
with
the
delicate
scent
of
flowers
wafting
down
from
the
cool
regions
of
the

where

while

joe
the
remainder
of
the
company
rode
in

wagons

hoofed
it
as
best
suited
their
mood
walking
sometimes
being
preferable
to
the
rumbling
and
jolting
of
the
heavy
vehicles
steadily
along
through
the
afternoon
sunlight
the
train
wended
its
way
the
teamsters
alternately
singing
and
cursing
their
mules
as
they
jogged
along
fearless
frank
and
the
general
rode
several
hundred
yards
in
advance
both
apparently
engrossed
in
deepest
thought
for
neither
spoke
until
toward
the
close
of
the
afternoon
charity
joe
called
their
attention
to
a
series
of
low
faint
cries
brought
down
upon
their
hearing
by
the
stiff
northerly
wind
to
me
as
how
them
sound

he
made
known
the
discovery
jes
listen
now
an
see
if
ye
ai
uv
ther

opinion
the
youth
did
listen
and
at
the
same
time
swept
the
plain
with
his
eagle
eyes
in
search
of
the
object
from
which
the
cries
emanated
but
nothing
of
animal
life
was
visible
in
any
direction
beyond
the
train
and
more
was
the
mystery
since
the
cries
sounded
but
a
little
way
off
they
human
cries
exclaimed
fearless
frank
excitedly
and
come
from
some

to

said
the
youth
bending
forward
in
a
listening
attitude
the
next
instant
silence
prevailed
and
the
twain
anxiously
listened
wafted
down
across
the
plain
came
in
faint
piteous
accents
the
repetition
of
the
cry
they
had
first
heard
only
it
was
now
much
fainter
evidently
whoever
was
in
distress
was
weakening
rapidly
soon
the
cries
would
be
inaudible
it
straight
ahead
exclaimed
fearless
frank
at
last
come
along
and
we
soon
see
what
the
matter
is
he
put
the
spurs
to
his
spirited
animal
and
the
next
instant
was
dashing
wildly
off
over
the
sunlit
plain
bent
on
emulation
the
general
also
used
his
heels
with
considerable
vim
but
alas
what
dependence
can
be
placed
on
a
mule
the
animal
bolted
with
a
vicious
nip
back
at
the
offending
rider
legs
and
refused
to
budge
an
inch
on
on
dashed
the
fearless
youth
mounted
on
his
noble
steed
his
eyes
bent
forward
in
a
sharp
scrutiny
of
the
plain
ahead
his
mind
filled
with
wonder
that
the
cries
were
now
growing
more
distinct
and
yet
not
a
first
glimpse
could
he
obtain
of
the
source
whence
they
emanated
on
on
on
then
suddenly
he
reins
his
steed
back
upon
its
haunches
just
in
time
to
avert
a
frightful
plunge
into
one
of
those
remarkable
freaks
of
nature
the
blind
canal
or
in
other
words
a
channel
valley
washed
out
by
heavy
rains
these
the
tourist
will
frequently
encounter
in
the
regions
contiguous
to
the
black
hills
below
him
yawned
an
abrupt
channel
a
score
or
more
of
feet
in
depth
at
the
bottom
of
which
was
a
dense
chaparral
thicket
the
little
valley
thus
nestled
in
the
earth
was
about
forty
rods
in
width
and
one
would
never
have
dreamed
it
existed
unless
they
chanced
to
ride
to
the
brink
above
fearless
frank
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
and
not
hearing
the
cries
he
rightly
conjectured
that
the
one
in
distress
had
again
become
exhausted
that
that
person
was
in
the
thicket
below
seemed
more
than
probable
and
he
immediately
resolved
to
descend
in
search
slipping
from
his
saddle
he
stepped
forward
to
the
very
edge
of
the
precipice
and
looked
over
the
next
second
the
ground
crumbled
beneath
his
feet
and
he
was
precipitated
headlong
into
the
valley
fortunately
he
received
no
serious
injuries
and
in
a
moment
was
on
his
feet
again
all
right
a
miss
is
as
good
as
a
mile
he
muttered
brushing
the
dirt
from
his
clothing
now
then
we
will
find
out
the
secret
of
the
racket
in
this
thicket
glancing
up
to
the
brink
above
to
see
that
his
horse
was
standing
quietly
he
parted
the
shrubbery
and
entered
the
thicket
it
required
considerable
pushing
and
tugging
to
get
through
the
dense
undergrowth
but
at
last
his
efforts
were
rewarded
and
he
stood
in
a
small
break
or
glade
stood
there
to
behold
a
sight
that
made
the
blood
boil
in
his
veins
securely
bound
with
her
face
toward
a
stake
was
a
young
girl
a
maiden
of
perhaps
seventeen
summers
whom
at
a
single
glance
one
might
surmise
was
remarkably
pretty
she
was
stripped
to
the
waist
and
upon
her
back
were
numerous
welts
from
which
trickled
diminutive
rivulets
of
crimson
her
head
was
dropped
against
the
stake
to
which
she
was
bound
and
she
was
evidently
insensible
with
a
cry
of
astonishment
and
indignation
fearless
frank
leaped
forward
to
sever
her
bonds
when
like
so
many
grim
phantoms
there
filed
out
of
the
chaparral
and
circled
around
him
a
score
of
hideously
painted
savages
one
glance
at
the
portly
leader
satisfied
frank
as
to
his
identity
it
was

saloons
are
literally
crammed
at
all
hours
and
dens
exist
hundreds
of
eager
expectant
and
hopeful
miners
are
working
in
the
mines
and
the
harvest
reaped
by
them
is
not
at
all
discouraging
all
along
the
gulch
are
strung
a
profusion
of
cabins
tents
and
shanties
making
deadwood
in
reality
a
town
of
a
dozen
miles
in
length
though
some
enterprising
individual
has
paired
off
a
couple
more
infant
cities
above
deadwood
proper
named
respectively
elizabeth
city
and
ten
strike
the
quartz
formation
in
these
neighborhoods
is
something
extraordinary
and
from
late
reports
under
vigorous
and
earnest
development
are
yielding
beyond
the
most
sanguine
expectation
the
placer
mines
west
of
camp
crook
are
being
opened
to
very
satisfactory
results
and
in
fact
from
custer
city
in
the
south
to
deadwood
in
the
north
all
is
the
scene
of
abundant
enthusiasm
and
excitement
a
horseman
riding
north
through
custer
gulch
noticed
the
placard
so
prominently
posted
for
public
inspection
and
with
a
low
whistle
expressive
of
astonishment
wheeled
his
horse
out
of
the
stage
road
and
rode
over
to
the
foot
of
the
tree
in
question
and
ran
his
eyes
over
the
few
lines
traced
upon
the
notice
he
was
a
youth
of
an
age
somewhere
between
sixteen
and
twenty
trim
and
compactly
built
with
a
preponderance
of
muscular
development
and
animal
spirits
broad
and
deep
of
chest
with
square
shoulders
limbs
small
yet
like
bars
of
steel
and
with
a
grace
of
position
in
the
saddle
rarely
equaled
he
made
a
fine
picture
for
an
artist
brush
or
a
poet
pen
only
one
thing
marred
the
captivating
beauty
of
the
picture
his
form
was
clothed
in
a
habit
of
which
was
colored
a
jetty
black
and
presented
a
striking
contrast
to
anything
one
sees
as
a
garment
in
the
wild
far
west
and
this
was
not
all
either
a
broad
black
hat
was
slouched
down
over
his
eyes
he
wore
a
thick
black
vail
over
the
upper
portion
of
his
face
through
the
of
which
there
gleamed
a
pair
of
orbs
of
piercing
intensity
and
his
hands
large
and
knotted
were
hidden
in
a
pair
of
kid
gloves
of
a
light
color
the
black
rider
he
might
have
been
justly
termed
for
his
thoroughbred
steed
was
as
black
as
coal
but
we
have
not
seen
fit
to
call
him
such
his
name
is
deadwood
dick
and
let
that
suffice
for
the
present
it
was
just
at
the
edge
of
evening
that
he
stopped
before
and
proceeded
to
read
the
placard
posted
upon
the
tree
in
one
of
the
loneliest
portions
of
custer
gulch
above
and
on
either
side
rose
to
a
stupendous
hight
the
mountains
in
all
their
majestic
grandeur
in
front
and
behind
running
nearly
north
and
south
lay
the
deep
dark
chasm
a
rift
between
mighty
walls
custer
gulch
and
over
all
began
to
hover
the
cloak
of
night
for
the
sun
had
already
imparted
its
dying
kiss
on
the
mountain
craters
and
below
the
gloom
was
thickening
with
rapid
strides
slowly
over
and
over
deadwood
dick
outlaw
and
outcast
read
the
notice
and
then
a
wild
sardonic
laugh
burst
from
beneath
his
mask
a
terrible
laugh
that
made
even
the
powerful
animal
he
bestrode
start
and
prick
up
its
ears
five
hundred
dollars
reward
for
the
apprehension
and
arrest
of
a
notorious
young
desperado
who
hails
to
the
name
of
deadwood
dick
ha
ha
ha
is
that
rich
now
ha
ha
ha
deadwood
dick
why
my
word
it
is
a
sight
for
sore
eyes
i
was
not
aware
that
i
had
attained
such
a
desperate
notoriety
as
that
document
implies
they
will
make
me
out
a
murderer
before
they
get
through
i
expect
let
me
alone
everlastingly
they
must
be
punching
after
me
as
if
i
was
some
obnoxious
pestilence
on
the
face
of
the
earth
never
mind
though
let
keep
on
let
them
just
continue
their
hounding
game
and
see
which
comes
up
on
top
when
the
bag
shook
if
more
than
one
of
do
get
their
fingers
burned
when
they
snatch
deadwood
dick
why
i
a
spring
creek
sucker
that
all
maybe
i
know
who
foots
the
bill
in
this
reward
business
oh
no
maybe
i
ride
down
to
deadwood
and
frighten
three
kind
o
ideas
out
of
this
hugh
vansevere
whoever
he
may
be
ha
ha
the
fool
that
that
notice
did
deadwood
dick
or
he
would
never
have
placed
his
life
in
jeopardy
by
performing
an
act
so
uninteresting
to
the
party
in
question
hugh
vansevere
let
me
see
i
do
think
i
got
that
registered
in
my
collection
of
appellatives
perhaps
he
is
a
new
tool
in
the
employ
of
the
old
mechanic
darker
and
thicker
grew
the
night
shadows
the
moon
rose
up
to
a
sufficient
hight
to
send
a
silvery
bolt
of
powerful
light
down
into
the
silent
gulch
like
an
image
carved
out
of
the
night
the
horse
and
rider
stood
before
the
placard
motionless
silent
the
head
of
deadwood
dick
was
bent
and
he
was
buried
in
a
deep
reverie
a
reverie
that
engrossed
his
whole
attention
for
a
long
long
while
then
the
impatient
pawing
of
his
horse
aroused
him
and
he
sat
once
more
erect
in
his
saddle
a
last
time
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
notice
on
the
tree
a
last
time
his
terrible
laugh
made
the
mountains
ring
and
he
guided
his
horse
back
into
the
rough
uneven
and
galloped
off
up
the
gulch
i
will
go
and
see
what
this
hugh

looks
like

said
applying
the
spurs
to

dashed
if
i
want
him
to

there
is
a
wild
clatter
of
hoofs
a
chorus
of
strange
and
varied
voices
swelling
out
in
a
wild
mountain
song
and
up
through
the
very
heart
of
the
diminutive
city
where
the
has
dropped
a
few
sanguine
souls
dash
a
cavalcade
of
masked
horsemen
attired
in
the
picturesque
garb
of
the
mountaineer
and
mounted
on
animals
of
superior
speed
and
endurance
at

wonderful

ride
the
dauntless
band
making
weirdly
beautiful
music
with
their
rollicking
song
some
of
the
voices
being
cultivated
and
clear
as
the
clarion
note
a
few
miners
wakened
from
their
repose
jump
out
of
bed
come
to
the
door
and
stare
at
the
receding
cavalcade
in
a
dazed
sort
of
way
others
thinking
that
the
noise
is
all
resulting
from

seize
rifles

be
and
blaze
away
out

loopholes
at
whatever
may
be
in
the
way
to
receive
their
bullets
but
the
only
pause
a
moment
in
their
song
to
send
back
a
wild
sarcastic
laugh
then
they
resume
it
and
merrily
dash
along
up
the
gulch
the
ringing
of
hoofs
beating
a
strange
tatoo
to
the
sound
of
the
music

crawl
back

down

this

of

population
at
midnight
hours
subsequent
to
the
rush
of
the
daring
through
camp
crook
deadwood
is
just
as
lively
and
hilarious
a
place
during
the
interval
between
sunset
and
sunrise
as
during
the
day
saloons
and
gambling
dens
keep
open
all
night
and
stores
do
not
close
until
a
late
hour
at
one
two
and
three
in
the
morning
the
streets
present
as
lively
an
appearance
as
at
any
period
earlier
in
the
evening
fighting
shooting
stabbing
and
hideous
swearing
are
features
of
the
night
singing
drinking
dancing
and
gambling
another
nightly
the
majority
of
the
miners
come
in
from
such
claims
as
are
within
a
radius
of
from
six
to
ten
miles
and
seldom
is
it
that
they
go
away
without
their
load
to
be
sure
there
are
some
men
in
deadwood
who
do
not
drink
but
they
are
so
few
and
scattering
as
to
seem
almost
entirely
a
nonentity
it
was
midnight
and
deadwood
lay
basking
in
a
flood
of
mellow
moonlight
that
cast
long
shadows
from
the
pine
forest
on
the
peaks
and
glinted
upon
the
rapid
muddy
waters
of
whitewood
creek
which
rumbles
noisily
by
the
infant
metropolis
on
its
wild
journey
toward

are
in
full
blast

judging

the
entertainment
is
such
as

the
depraved

with

blowing
backward
in

followed
by
the
eyes

curious
to

halts
in

of
a
large

is
the

chapter
iii
the
cattymount
a
quarrel
and
its
results
the
metropolitan
saloon
in
deadwood
one
week
subsequent
to
the
events
last
narrated
was
the
scene
of
a
larger
jamboree
than
for
many
weeks
before
it
was
saturday
night
and
up
from
the
mines
of
gold
run
bobtail
poor
man
pocket
and
spearfish
and
down
from
the
deadwood
in
miniature
crook
city
poured
a
swarm
of
rugged
grisly
the
pilgrim
and
the
inevitable
wary
sharp
ever
on
the
alert
for
a
new
buck
to
fleece
the
metropolitan
was
then
as
now
the
headquarters
of
the
black
hills
metropolis
for
arriving
trains
and
stages
and
as
a
natural
consequence
received
a
goodly
share
of
the
public
patronage
a
bar
of
liquors
in
deadwood
was
yet
the
saloon
in
question
boasted
the
best
to
be
had
every
bar
has
its
clerk
at
a
pair
of
tiny
scales
and
he
is
ever
kept
more
than
busy
weighing
out
the
shining
dust
that
the
toiling
miner
has
obtained
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
and
if
the
clerk
can
not
put
six
ounces
of
dust
in
his
own
pouch
of
a
night
it
clearly
shows
that
he
is
not
long
in
the
business
saturday
night
the
saloon
is
full
to
overflowing
full
of
brawny
rough
and
grisly
men
full
of
ribald
songs
and
maudlin
curses
full
of
foul
atmospheres
impregnated
with
the
fumes
of
vile
whisky
and
worse
tobacco
and
full
of
sights
and
scenes
exciting
and
repulsive
as
we
enter
and
work
our
way
toward
the
center
of
the
apartment
our
attention
is
attracted
by
a
coarse
brutal
tough
evidently
just
fresh
in
from
the
diggings
who
mounted
on
the
summit
of
an
empty
whisky
cask
is
exhorting
in
rough
language
and
in
the
tones
of
a
bellowing
bull
to
an
audience
of
admiring
miners
assembled
at
his
feet
which
by
the
way
are
not
of
the
most
diminutive
pattern
imaginable

sent

and
scattered
permiscously
ter

uv

we
pass
the
cattymount
and
presently
come
to
a
table
at
which
a
young
and
handsome
pilgrim
and
a
sharp
are
engaged
at
cards
the
first
mentioned
is
a
tall
robust
fellow
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
years
of
age
with
features
dark
lustrous
eyes
and
teeth
of
pearly
whiteness
his
hair
is
long
and
curling
and
a
soft
brown
mustache
waxed
at
the
ends
is
almost
perfection
itself
evidently
he
is
of
quick
temperament
for
he
handles
the
cards
with
a
swift
nervous
dexterity
that
surprises
even
the
professional
sharp
himself
who
is
a
black
customer
with
villain
plainly
written
in
every
lineament
of
his
countenance
his
eyes
hair
and
a
tremendous
mustache
that
he
occasionally
strokes
are
of
a
jetty
black
did
you
ever
notice
it
dark
hair
and
complexion
predominate
among
the
gambling
fraternity
perhaps
this
is
owing
to
the
condition
of
the
souls
of
some
of
these
characters
the
professional
sharp
in
our
case
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
he
was
attired
in
the
hight
of
fashion
and
the
diamond
cluster
inevitably
to
be
found
there
was
on
his
shirt
front
a
jewel
of
wonderful
size
and
brilliancy
ah
curse
the
luck
exclaimed
the
sharp
slapping
down
the
cards
you
have
won
again
pilgrim
and
i
am
five
hundred
out
by
the
gods
your
luck
is
something
astonishing
laughed
the
other
coolly
well
no
i
do
not
call
it
luck
for
i
never
have
luck
we
call
it
chance
just
as
you
say
growled
the
gambler
bringing
forth
a
new
pack
chance
and
luck
are
then
twin
companions
will
you
continue
longer
redburn
finished
the
pilgrim
ah
yes
redburn
will
you
continue
i
will
play
as
long
as
there
is
anything
to
play
for
again
finished
twisting
the
waxed
ends
of
his
mustache
calmly
maybe
you
have
got
your
fill
eh
no
i
play
all
night
to
win
back
what
i
have
lost
a
youth
attired
in
and
apparently
a
couple
of
years
younger
than
redburn
came
sauntering
along
at
this
juncture
and
seeing
an
unoccupied
chair
at
one
end
of
the
table
for
redburn
and
the
gambler
sat
at
the
sides
facing
each
other
he
took
possession
of
it
forthwith
hello
and
the
sharp
swore
roundly
who
told
to
mix
in
your
lip
pilgrim
nobody
as
i
know
of
thought
i
squat
right
here
and
watch
your
was
the
significant
retort
and
the
youth
laid
a
cocked
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
go
on
gentlemen
do
let
me
be
the
means
of
spoiling
your
fun
the
gambler
uttered
a
curse
and
dealt
out
the
pasteboards
the
youth
was
watching
him
intently
with
his
sharp
black
eyes
he
was
of
medium
hight
straight
as
an
arrow
and
clad
in
a
costume
a
broad
sombrero
was
set
jauntily
upon
the
left
side
of
his
head
the
hair
of
which
had
been
cut
close
down
to
the
scalp
his
face
a
pleasant
handsome
youthful
face
was
devoid
of
hirsute
covering
he
having
evidently
been
recently
handled
by
the
barber
the
game
between
redburn
and
the
gambler
progressed
the
eyes
of
he
whom
we
have
just
described
were
on
the
card
sharp
constantly
the
cards
went
down
on
the
table
in
vigorous
slaps
and
at
last
pilgrim
redburn
raked
in
the
stakes
thunder
moses
ejaculated
the
sharp
pulling
out
his
watch
an
elegant
affair
of
pure
gold
and
studded
with
diamonds
and
laying
it
forcibly
down
upon
the
table
there
what
will
you
plank
on
that
redburn
took
up
the
turned
it
over
and
over
in
his
hands
opened
and
shut
it
gave
a
glance
at
the
works
and
then
handed
it
over
to
the
youth
whom
he
instinctively
felt
was
his
friend
redburn
had
come
from
the
east
to
dig
gold
and
therefore
was
a
stranger
in
deadwood
what
is
its
money
value
he
asked
familiarizing
his
tone
good
i
suppose
yes
perfectly
good
and
cheap
at
two
hundred
was
the
unhesitating
reply
do
you
lack
funds
stranger
oh
no
i
am
three
hundred
ahead
of
this
cuss
yet
and
you
better
quit
where
you
are
said
the
other
decisively
lose
the
next
round
mark
my
word
ha
ha
laughed
redburn
who
had
begun
to
show
symptoms
of
recklessness
i
take
my
chances
here
you
gamin
i
cover
the
watch
with
two
hundred
dollars
without
more
ado
the
stakes
were
planked
the
cards
dealt
and
the
game
began
the
youth
whom
we
will
call
ned
harris
was
not
idle
he
took
the
revolvers
from
the
table
changed
his
position
so
that
his
face
was
just
in
the
opposite
direction
of
what
it
had
been
and
commenced
to
pare
his
finger
nails
the
fingers
were
as
white
and
soft
as
any
girl
in
his
hand
he
also
held
a
little
box
the
sides
of
which
were
looking
at
his
he
also
looked
into
the
mirror
which
gave
a
complete
view
of
the
as
he
sat
at
the
table
swiftly
progressed
the
game
and
no
one
could
fail
to
see
how
it
was
going
by
watching
the
cunning
light
in
the
gambler
eye
at
last
the
went
down
and
next
instant
after
the
sharp
had
raked
in
his
stakes
a
cocked
revolver
in
either
hand
of
ned
harris
covered
the
hearts
of
the
two
players
hello
gasped
redburn
quailing
under
the
gaze
of
a
cold
steel
tube
what
the
row
now
draw
your
revolver
commanded
harris
sternly
having
an
eye
on
the
at
the
same
time
come
do
be
all
night
about
it
redburn
obeyed
he
had
no
other
choice
cock
it
and
cover
your
man
who
do
you
mean
the
cuss
under
my
aim
again
the
pilgrim
felt
that
he
could
not
afford
to
do
otherwise
than
obey
so
he
took
squint
at
the
gambler
left
breast
after
which
harris
withdrew
the
siege
of
his
left
weapon
although
he
still
covered
the
young
easterner
the
same
quietly
he
moved
around
to
where
the
sat
white
and
trembling
gentlemen
he
yelled
in
a
clear
ringing
voice
will
some
of
you
step
this
way
a
moment
a
crowd
gathered
around
in
a
moment
then
the
youth
resumed
all
of
you
know
how
to
play
cards
no
doubt
what
is
the
penalty
of
cheating
out
here
in
the
hills
for
a
few
seconds
the
room
was
wrapt
in
silence
then
a
chorus
of
voices
gave
answer
using
a
single
word
death
exactly
said
harris
calmly
when
a
sharp
hides
cards
in
chinaman
fashion
up
his
sleeve
i
reckon
that
what
you
call
cheatin
you
that
the
size
of
it
assented
each
bystander
grimly
ned
harris
pressed
his
against
the
gambler
forehead
inserted
his
fingers
in
each
of
the
capacious
sleeves
and
a
moment
later
laid
several
high
cards
upon
the
table
a
murmur
of
incredulity
went
through
the
crowd
of
spectators
even
pilgrim
redburn
was
astonished
after
removing
the
cards
ned
harris
turned
and
leveled
his
revolver
at
the
head
of
the
young
man
from
the
east
your
name
he
said
briefly
is
harry
redburn
very
well
harry
redburn
that
gambler
under
cover
of
your
pistol
is
guilty
of
a
crime
punishable
in
the
black
hills
by
death
as
you
are
his
victim
or
rather
were
to
be
it
only
remains
for
you
to
aim
straight
and
rid
your
country
of
an
a
no
and
swindler
oh
no
gasped
redburn
horrified
at
the
thought
of
taking
the
life
of
a
i
can
not
i
can
not
you
said
harris
sternly
go
on
must
salt
that
or
i
certainly
salt
you
a
deathlike
silence
followed
said
harris
after
a
moment
redburn
grew
very
pale
but
not
paler
was
he
than
the
just
opposite
redburn
was
no
coward
neither
was
he
accustomed
to
the
desperate
character
of
the
population
of
the
hills
should
he
shoot
the
tricky
wretch
before
him
he
knew
he
should
be
always
calling
himself
a
murderer
on
the
contrary
in
the
natural
laws
of
deadwood
such
a
murder
would
be
classed
justice
said
ned
harris
drawing
his
back
to
full
cock
come
pilgrim
are
you
going
to
shoot
another
silence
only
the
low
breathing
of
the
spectators
could
be
heard
redburn
raised
his
pistol
and
fired
blindly
and
carelessly
not
knowing
or
caring
whither
went
the
compulsory
bullet
there
was
a
heavy
fall
a
groan
of
pain
as
the
gambler
dropped
over
on
the
floor
then
for
the
space
of
a
few
seconds
all
was
the
wildest
confusion
throughout
the
mammoth
saloon
revolvers
were
in
every
hand
knives
flashed
in
the
glare
of
the
lamplight
curses
and
threats
were
in
scores
of
mouths
while
some
of
the
vast
surging
crowd
cheered
lustily
at
the
table
harry
redburn
still
sat
as
motionless
as
a
statue
the
revolver
still
held
in
his
hand
his
face
white
his
eyes
staring
there
he
remained
the
center
of
general
attraction
with
a
hundred
pair
of
blazing
eyes
leveled
at
him
from
every
side
come
said
ned
harris
in
a
low
tone
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
come
pardner
let
git
out
of
this
for
times
will
be
brisk
soon
you

one
of
the
biggest
in

rearin
pretty
quick
look

who
was

fellers
behind
him
are
his
gang
come

me
henry
and
i
nose
our
way
out
of
here
redburn
signified
his
readiness
and
with
a
cocked
in
either
hand
ned
harris
led
the
way
chapter
iv
sad
anita
the
mine
locater
trouble
straight
toward
the
door
of
the
saloon
he
marched
the
muzzles
of
the
grim
sixes
clearing
a
path
to
him
for
ned
harris
had
become
notorious
in
deadwood
for
his
coolness
courage
and
audacity
it
had
been
said
of
him
that
he
would
just
es
lief
shute
a
man
as
ter
look
at
and
perhaps
the
speaker
was
not
far
from
right
anyway
he
led
off
through
the
audience
with
a
composure
that
was
remarkable
and
strange
to
say
not
a
hand
was
raised
to
stop
him
until
he
came
face
to
face
with
catamount
cass
and
his
gang
here
was
where
the
youth
had
expected
molestation
and
hindrance
if
anywhere
catamount
cass
was
a
rough
illiterate
tough
of
the
mountain
species
and
possessed
more
brute
courage
than
the
general
run
of
his
type
of
men
and
a
determination
that
made
him
all
the
more
dangerous
as
an
enemy
harry
redburn
kept
close
at
ned
harris
heels
a
cocked
six
in
either
hand
ready
for
any
emergency
it
took
but
a
few
moments
before
the
two
parties
met
the
cattymount
throwing
out
his
foot
to
block
the
path
hello
roared
the
tough
folding
his
huge
knotty
arms
across
his
partially
bared
breast

ned
fingering
the
trigger
of
his
left
six
uneasily
ef

to
know
who

diamond
the
worst
blackleg
trickster

dakota
all
you

cried
harry
redburn
stepping
out
from
behind
harris
hide
behind
no
man
shoulder
salted
the
gambler
if
you
call
shooting
salting
and
i
not
afraid
to
repeat
the
action
by
salting
a
dozen
more
just
of
his
particular
style
ned
harris
was
surprised
he
had
set
redburn
down
as
a
from
the
east
he
saw
now
that
there
was
something
of
him
after
all
come
on
young
man
and
the
young
miner
stepped
forward
a
pace
are
you
with
me
to
the
ears
replied
harris
grimly
the
next
instant
the
twain
leaped
forward
and
broke
the
barrier
and
mid
the
crack
of
and
shouts
of
rage
they
cleared
the
saloon
once
outside
ned
harris
led
the
way
come
along
he
said
dodging
along
the
shadowy
side
of
the
street
we
have
to
scratch
gravel
for
them
will
follow
us
i
reckon
they
a
game
gang
and
the
most
desirable
kind
of
enemies
one
could
wish
for
i
take
you
over
to
my
coop
and
you
can
lay
low
there
until
this
jamboree
blows
over
you
have
to
promise
me
one
thing
however
ere
i
can
admit
you
as
a
member
of
my
household
certainly
what
is
it
and
harry
redburn
redoubled
his
efforts
in
order
to
keep
alongside
his
guide
promise
me
that
you
will
divulge
nothing
no
matter
what
you
may
see
or
hear
also
that
should
you
fall
in
love
with
one
who
is
a
member
of
my
family
you
will
forbear
and
not
speak
of
love
to
her
it
is
a
woman
then
yes
a
young
lady
i
will
promise
how
can
i
afford
to
do
otherwise
under
the
existing
circumstances
but
tell
me
why
did
you
force
me
to
shoot
that
gambler
he
was
a
rascal
and
cheated
you
i
know
but
i
did
not
want
his
life
i
am
averse
to
bloodshed
so
i
perceived
and
that
made
me
all
the
more
determined
you
should
salivate
him
you
find
before
you
in
the
hills
long
that
it
wo
do
to
take
lip
or
lead
from
any
one
a
green
pilgrim
is
the
first
to
get
salted
i
illustrated
how
to
serve
redburn
eyes
sparkled
he
was
just
beginning
to
see
into
the
different
phases
of
this
wild
exciting
life
good
he
exclaimed
warmly
i
have
much
to
thank
you
for
did
i
kill
that
no
you
simply
perforated
him
in
the
right
side
this
way
they
had
been
running
straight
up
the
main
street
now
they
turned
a
corner
and
darted
down
one
that
was
dark
and
deserted
a
moment
later
a
trim
boyish
figure
stepped
before
them
from
out
of
the
shadow
of
a
new
frame
building
a
hand
of
creamy
whiteness
was
laid
upon
the
arm
of
ned
harris
this
way
pilgrims
said
a
low
musical
voice
and
at
the
same
instant
a
gust
of
wind
lifted
the
jaunty
sombrero
from
the
head
revealing
a
most
wonderful
wealth
of
long
glossy
hair
the
are
after
you
and
you
can
not
find
a
better
place
to
coop
than
in
here
the
soft
hand
drew
ned
harris
inside
the
building
which
was
finished
but
unoccupied
and
redburn
followed
nothing
loth
to
get
into
a
place
of
safety
so
far
deadwood
had
not
impressed
him
favorably
as
being
the
most
peaceable
city
within
the
scope
of
a
continent
into
an
inner
room
of
the
building
they
went
and
the
door
was
closed
behind
them
the
apartment
was
small
and
smelled
of
green
lumber
a
table
and
a
few
chairs
comprised
the
furniture
a
dark
lantern
burned
suspended
from
the
ceiling
by
a
wire
redburn
eyed
the
strange
youth
as
he
and
harris
were
handed
seats
of
medium
hight
and
symmetrically
built
dressed
in
a
carefully
tanned
costume
of
the
vest
being
fringed
with
the
fur
of
the
mink
wearing
a
jaunty
spanish
sombrero
boots
on
the
dainty
feet
of
patent
leather
with
tops
reaching
to
the
knees
a
face
slightly
yet
showing
the
traces
of
beauty
that
even
excessive
dissipation
could
not
obliterate
eyes
black
and
piercing
mouth
firm
resolute
and
devoid
of
sensual
expression
hair
of
raven
color
and
of
remarkable
length
such
was
the
picture
of
the
youth
as
beheld
by
redburn
and
harris
you
can
remain
here
till
you
think
it
will
be
safe
to
again
venture
forth
gentlemen
and
a
smile
evidently
a
stranger
there
broke
out
about
the
speaker
lips
nodded
harris
with
a
quizzical
stare
the
next
moment
the
youth
was
gone
who
was
that
chap
asked
redburn
not
a
little
bewildered
that
why
that
calamity
jane
calamity
jane
a
name
yes
she
an
odd
one
can
ride
like
the
wind
shoot
like
a
and
swear
like
a
trooper
is
here
there
and
everywhere
seemingly
all
at
one
time
owns
this
coop
and
two
or
three
other
lots
in
deadwood
a
herding
ranch
at
laramie
an
interest
in
a
paying
placer
claim
near
elizabeth
city
and
the
lord
only
knows
how
much
more
but
it
is
not
a
reckon
nothin
else
god
forbid
that
a
child
of
mine
should
ever
become
so
debased
and
hold
there
are
yet
a
few
redeeming
qualities
about
her
she
was
and
here
a
shade
dark
as
a
passed
over
ned
harris
face
and
set
adrift
upon
the
world
homeless
and
friendless
yet
she
has
bravely
fought
her
way
through
the
storm
without
asking
anybody
assistance
true
she
may
not
now
have
a
heart
that
was
trampled
upon
years
ago
but
her
character
has
not
suffered
blemish
since
the
day
a
foul
wretch
stole
away
her
honor
what
is
her
real
name
i
do
not
know
few
in
deadwood
do
it
is
said
however
that
she
comes
of
a
virginia
city
nevada
family
of
respectability
and
intelligence
at
this
juncture
there
was
a
great
hubbub
outside
and
instinctively
the
twain
drew
their
revolvers
expecting
that
catamount
cass
and
his
toughs
had
discovered
their
retreat
and
were
about
to
make
an
attack
but
soon
the
gang
were
beard
to
tramp
away
making
the
night
hideous
with
their
hoarse
yells
they
pay
a
visit
to
every
shanty
in
deadwood
said
harris
with
a
grim
smile
and
if
they
do
find
us
which
they
wo
more
than
a
barrel
of
over
their
defeat
come
be
going
they
left
the
building
and
once
more
emerged
onto
the
darkened
street
ned
taking
the
lead
follow
me
now
he
said
tightening
his
belt
and
we
get
home
before
sunrise
after
all
he
struck
out
up
the
gulch
or
rather
down
it
for
his
course
lay
southward
redburn
followed
and
in
fifteen
minutes
the
lights
of
deadwood
magic
city
of
the
wilderness
were
left
behind
harris
led
the
way
along
the
rugged
mountain
that
after
leaving
deadwood
on
its
way
to
camp
crook
and
custer
city
in
the
south
runs
alternately
through
deep
dark
canyons
and
gorges
with
an
ease
and
rapidity
that
showed
him
to
be
well
acquainted
with
the
route
about
three
miles
below
deadwood
he
struck
a
trail
through
a
transverse
canyon
running
through
which
flowed
a
small
stream
known
as
brown
creek
the
bottom
was
level
and
smooth
and
a
brisk
walk
of
a
brought
them
to
where
a
horse
was
tied
to
an
alder
sapling
you
mount
and
ride
on
ahead
until
you
come
to
the
end
of
the
canyon
said
harris
untying
the
horse
i
will
follow
on
after
you
and
be
there
almost
as
soon
as
you
redburn
would
have
offered
some
objections
but
the
other
motioned
for
him
to
mount
and
be
off
so
he
concluded
it
best
to
obey
the
animal
was
a
fiery
one
and
soon
carried
him
out
of
sight
of
ned
whom
he
left
standing
in
the
yellow
moonlight
sooner
than
he
expected
the
gorge
came
to
an
abrupt
termination
in
the
face
of
a
stupendous
wall
of
rock
and
nothing
remained
to
do
but
wait
for
young
harris
he
soon
came
trotting
leisurely
up
only
a
trifle
flushed
in
countenance
this
way
he
said
and
seizing
the
animal
by
the
bit
he
led
horse
and
rider
into
a
black
gaping
fissure
in
one
side
of
the
canyon
that
had
hitherto
escaped
redburn
notice
it
was
a
large
narrow
subterranean
passage
barely
large
enough
to
admit
the
horse
and
rider
redburn
soon
was
forced
to
dismount
and
bring
up
the
rear
how
far
do
we
journey
in
this
shape
he
demanded
after
what
seemed
to
him
a
long
while
no
further
replied
ned
and
the
next
instant
they
emerged
into
a
small
circular
pocket
in
the
midst
of
the
mountains
one
of
those
beauteous
valleys
which
are
often
found
in
the
black
hills
this
pocket
as
they
are
called
consisted
of
perhaps
fifty
acres
walled
in
on
every
side
by
rugged
mountains
as
steep
and
steeper
in
some
places
than
a
on
the
western
side
brown
creek
had
its
source
and
leaped
merrily
down
from
ledge
to
ledge
into
the
valley
across
which
it
flowed
sinking
into
the
earth
on
the
eastern
side
only
to
bubble
up
again
in
the
canyon
with
renewed
strength
the
valley
was
one
vast
indiscriminate
bed
of
wild
fragrant
flowers
whose
volume
of
perfume
was
almost
sickening
when
first
greeting
the
nostrils
every
color
and
variety
imaginable
was
here
all
in
the
most
perfect
bloom
in
the
center
of
the
valley
stood
a
overgrown
with
clinging
vines
there
was
a
light
in
the
window
and
harris
pointed
toward
it
as
with
young
redburn
he
emerged
from
the
fissure
there
my
coop
pilgrim
there
you
will
be
safe
for
a
time
at
least
he
unsaddled
the
horse
and
set
it
free
to
graze
then
they
set
off
down
across
the
slope
arriving
at
the
cabin
in
due
time
the
door
was
open
a
young
woman
sweet
yet
was
seated
upon
the
steps
fast
asleep
redburn
gave
an
involuntary
cry
of
incredulity
and
admiration
as
his
eyes
rested
upon
the
picture
upon
the
pure
sweet
face
surrounded
by
a
wealth
of
golden
glossy
hair
and
the
form
so
perfect
in
every
contour
but
a
charge
of
silence
from
harris
made
him
mute
the
young
man
knelt
by
the
side
of
the
sleeping
girl
and
imprinted
a
kiss
upon
the
fresh
unpolluted
lips
which
caused
the
sleeping
beauty
to
smile
in
her
dreams
a
moment
later
however
she
opened
her
eyes
and
sprung
to
her
feet
with
a
startled
scream
oh
ned
she
gasped
trembling
as
she
saw
him
how
you
frightened
me
i
had
a
dream
oh
such
a
sweet
dream
and
i
thought
came
and
kissed
suddenly
did
she
stop
as
for
the
first
time
her
penetrating
blue
eyes
rested
upon
harry
blackburn
a
moment
she
gazed
at
him
as
in
a
sort
of
fascination
then
with
a
low
cry
began
to
retreat
growing
deathly
pale
ned
harris
stepped
quickly
forward
and
supported
her
on
his
arm
be
calm
anita
he
said
in
a
gentle
reassuring
tone
this
is
a
young
gentleman
whom
i
have
brought
here
to
our
home
for
a
few
days
until
it
will
be
safe
for
him
to
be
seen
in
deadwood
redburn
i
make
you
acquainted
with
anita
a
courteous
bow
from
redburn
a
slight
inclination
of
anita
head
and
the
introduction
was
made
a
moment
later
the
three
entered
the
cabin
a
model
of
neatness
and
primitive
luxury
how
is
it
that
you
are
up
so
early
dear
young
harris
asked
as
he
unbuckled
his
belt
and
hung
it
upon
a
peg
in
the
wall
you
are
rarely
as
spry
eh
indeed
i
have
not
been
to
bed
at
all
replied
the
girl
a
weary
smile
wreathing
her
lips
i
was
nervous
and
feared
something
was
going
to
happen
so
i
staid
up
your
old
plea
the
presentiment
of
coming
danger
i
suppose
and
the
youth
laughed
gayly
but
you
need
not
fear
no
one
will
invade
our
little
paradise
right
away
what
is
your
opinion
of
it
redburn
i
should
say
not
i
think
this
little
mountain
retreat
is
without
equal
replied
harry
with
enthusiasm
the
only
wonder
is
how
did
you
ever
stumble
into
such
a
delightful
place
of
that
i
will
perhaps
tell
you
another
time
said
harris
musingly
day
soon
dawned
over
the
mountains
and
the
early
morning
sunlight
fell
with
charming
effect
into
the
little
pocket
with
its
countless
thousands
of
odorous
flowers
and
the
little
cabin
nestling
down
among
them
all
sweet
anita
prepared
a
sumptuous
morning
repast
out
of
and
the
eggs
of
wild
birds
with
dainty
side
dishes
of
late
summer
berries
and
a
large
luscious
melon
which
had
been
grown
on
a
cultivated
patch
contiguous
to
the
cabin
both
harris
and
his
guest
did
ample
justice
to
the
meal
for
they
had
neither
eaten
anything
since
the
preceding
noon
when
they
had
finished
ned
arose
from
the
table
saying
pardner
i
shall
leave
you
here
for
a
few
days
during
which
time
i
shall
probably
be
mostly
away
on
business
make
yourself
at
home
and
see
that
anita
is
properly
protected
i
will
return
in
a
week
at
the
furthest
perhaps
in
a
day
or
two
he
took
down
his
rifle
and
belt
from
the
wall
buckled
on
the
latter
and
half
an
hour
later
left
the
pocket
that
was
a
day
of
days
to
harry
redburn
he
rambled
about
the
picturesque
little
valley
romped
on
the
luxuriant
grass
and
gathered
wild
flowers
alternately
at
night
he
sat
in
the
cabin
door
and
listened
to
the
cries
of
the
night
birds
and
the
incessant
hooting
of
the
mountain
owls
which
by
the
way
are
very
abundant
throughout
the
black
hills
all
efforts
to
engage
anita
in
conversation
proved
fruitless
on
the
following
day
both
were
considerably
astonished
to
perceive
that
there
was
a
stranger
in
their
paradise
a
grisly
little
old
fellow
who
walked
with
a
staff
he
approached
the
cabin
and
redburn
went
out
to
find
who
he
was
nodded
general
nix
for
it
was
he
with
a
grin
i

replied
redburn
who
had
already
learned
from
study
and
experience
how
to
guess
a
fat
strike
it
is
out
of
the
channel
no
et

i

the
general
chuckled
approvingly
see

so
i
nosed
about
ter
find
whar
he
kim
from
that
how
i
got
here
i
hed
a
dream
about
this
place
indeed
redburn
was
puzzled
how
to
act
under
the
circumstances
just
then
there
came
a
piercing
scream
from
the
direction
of
the
cabin
what
could
it
mean
was
nix
an
enemy
and
was
some
one
else
of
his
gang
attacking
anita
certainly
she
in
trouble
chapter
sitting
bull
the
fair
captive
fearless
frank
stepped
back
aghast
as
he
saw
the
inhuman
chief
of
the
sioux
the
cruel
warrior
sitting
bull
shrunk
back
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
butt
of
a
revolver
ha
he
articulated
is
that
you
chief
you
and
at
such
work
as
this
there
was
stern
reproach
in
the
youth
tone
and
certain
it
is
that
the
sioux
warrior
heard
the
words
spoken
my
friend
scarlet
boy
is
keen
with
the
tongue
he
said
frowning
let
him
put
shackles
upon
it
before
it
leaps
over
the
bounds
of
reason
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
not
speak
in
behalf
of
yon
suffering
girl
retorted
the
youth
fearlessly
on
whom
you
have
been
inflicting
one
of
the
most
inhuman
tortures
indian
cunning
could
conceive
for
shame
chief
that
you
should
ever
assent
to
such
an
act
lower
yourself
to
the
grade
of
a
dog
by
such
a
dastard
deed
for
shame
i
say
instantly
the
form
of
the
great
warrior
straightened
up
like
an
arrow
and
his
painted
hand
flew
toward
the
pistols
in
his
belt
but
the
succeeding
second
he
seemed
to
change
his
intention
his
hand
went
out
toward
the
youth
in
greeting
the
scarlet
boy
is
right
he
said
with
as
much
graveness
as
a
can
conceive
sitting
bull
listens
to
his
words
as
he
would
to
those
of
a
brother
scarlet
boy
is
no
stranger
in
the
land
of
the
sioux
he
is
the
friend
of
the
great
chief
and
his
warriors
once
when
the
were
at
war
over
the
pine
forests
and
picture
rocks
of
the
hills
when
the
great
spirit
was
sending
fiery
messengers
down
in
vivid
streaks
from
the
skies
the
big
chief
cast
a
thunderbolt
in
playfulness
at
the
feet
of
sitting
bull
the
shock
of
the
hand
of
the
great
spirit
did
not
escape
me
for
hours
i
lay
like
one
slain
in
battle
my
warriors
were
in
consternation
they
ran
hither
and
thither
in
affright
calling
on
the
manitou
to
preserve
their
chief
you
came
scarlet
boy
in
the
midst
of
all
the
panic
came
and
though
then
but
a
stripling
you
applied
simple
remedies
that
restored
sitting
bull
to
the
arms
of
his
warriors
a
from
that
hour
sitting
bull
was
your
friend
is
your
friend
now
and
will
be
as
long
as
the
exist
as
a
tribe
thank
you
chief
and
fearless
frank
grasped
the
indian
hand
and
wrung
it
warmly
i
believe
you
mean
all
you
say
but
i
am
surprised
to
find
you
engaged
at
such
work
as
this
i
have
been
told
that
sitting
bull
made
war
only
on
warriors
not
on
women
an
ugly
frown
darkened
the
savage
face
a
frown
wherein
was
depicted
a
number
of
slumbering
passions
the
girl
is
the
last
survivor
of
a
train
that
the
warriors
of
sitting
bull
attacked
in
red
canyon
sitting
bull
lost
many
warriors
yon
pale
squaw
shot
down
full
a
before
she
could
be
captured
she
belongs
to
the
warriors
of
sitting
bull
and
not
to
the
great
chief
himself
yet
you
have
the
power
to
free
her
to
yield
her
up
to
me
consider
chief
are
you
not
enough
my
friend
that
you
can
afford
to
give
me
the
girl
surely
she
has
been
tortured
sufficiently
to
satisfy
your
braves
thirst
for
vengeance
sitting
bull
was
silent
what
will
the
scarlet
boy
do
with
the
fair
maiden
of
his
tribe
bear
her
to
a
place
of
safety
chief
and
care
for
her
until
i
can
find
her
friends
probably
she
has
friends
in
the
east
it
shall
be
as
he
says
sitting
bull
will
withdraw
his
braves
and
scarlet
boy
can
have
the
prize
a
friendly
between
the
youth
and
the
sioux
chieftain
a
word
from
the
latter
to
the
grim
painted
warriors
and
the
next
instant
the
glade
was
cleared
of
the
savages
fearless
frank
then
hastened
to
approach
the
insensible
captive
and
with
a
couple
sweeps
of
his
knife
cut
the
bonds
that
held
her
to
the
gently
he
laid
her
on
the
grass
and
arranged
about
her
form
the
garments
sitting
bull
warriors
had
torn
off
and
soon
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
once
more
clothed
properly
it
still
remained
for
him
to
restore
her
to
consciousness
and
this
promised
to
be
no
easy
task
for
she
was
in
a
dead
swoon
she
was
even
more
beautiful
of
face
and
figure
than
one
would
have
imagined
at
a
first
glance
of
a
delicate
blonde
complexion
with
cheeks
she
made
a
very
pretty
picture
her
face
framed
as
it
was
in
a
wild
disheveled
cloud
of
auburn
hair
a
hatful
of
cold
water
from
a
neighboring
spring
dashed
into
her
upturned
face
a
continued
chafing
of
the
pure
white
soft
hands
then
there
was
a
convulsive
twitching
of
the
features
a
low
moan
and
the
eyes
opened
and
darted
a
glance
of
affright
into
the
face
of
the
scarlet
boy
fear
not
miss
and
the
youth
gently
supported
her
to
a
sitting
posture
i
am
a
friend
and
your
cruel
captors
have
vamosed
lucky
i
came
along
just
as
i
did
or
it
likely
they
have
killed
you
oh
sir
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
for
rescuing
me
from
those
merciless
fiends
and
the
maiden
gave
him
a
grateful
glance
they
whipped
me
terribly
i
know
lady
all
because
you
defended
yourself
in
red
canyon
i
suppose
so
but
how
did
you
find
out
so
much
and
also
effect
my
release
from
the
savages
fearless
frank
leaned
up
against
the
tree
which
had
been
used
as
the
and
related
what
is
already
known
to
the
reader
when
he
had
finished
the
rescued
captive
seized
his
hand
between
both
her
own
and
thanked
him
warmly
had
it
not
been
for
you
sir
no
one
but
our
god
knows
what
would
have
been
my
fate
oh
sir
what
can
i
do
more
than
to
thank
you
a
thousand
times
to
repay
you
for
the
great
service
you
have
rendered
me
nothing
lady
nothing
that
i
think
of
at
present
was
it
not
my
duty
while
i
had
the
power
to
free
you
from
the
hands
of
those
barbarians
certainly
it
was
and
i
deserve
no
thanks
but
tell
me
what
is
your
name
and
were
your
friends
all
killed
in
the
train
from
which
you
were
taken
i
had
no
friends
sir
save
a
lady
whose
acquaintance
i
made
on
the
journey
out
from
cheyenne
as
to
my
name
you
can
call
me
miss
terry
mystery
in
blank
amazement
yes
with
a
gay
laugh
mystery
if
you
choose
my
name
is
alice
terry
oh
and
the
youth
began
to
brighten
miss
terry
to
be
sure
mystery
ha
ha
good
joke
i
shall
call
you
the
latter
have
you
friends
and
relatives
east
no
i
came
west
to
meet
my
father
who
is
somewhere
in
the
black
hills
do
you
know
at
what
place
i
do
not
i
fear
it
will
be
a
hard
matter
to
find
him
then
the
hills
now
have
a
floating
population
of
about
thousand
souls
your
father
would
be
one
to
find
out
of
that
lot
a
faint
smile
came
over
the
girl
face
i
should
know
papa
among
fifty
thousand
if
necessary
she
said
although
i
have
not
seen
him
for
years
she
failed
to
mention
how
many
or
what
peculiarities
she
would
recognize
him
by
was
he
blind
deaf
or
dumb
fearless
frank
glanced
around
him
and
saw
that
a
path
rugged
and
steep
led
up
to
the
prairie
above
come
he
said
offering
his
arm
we
will
get
up
to
the
plains
and
go
where
to
asked
miss
terry
rising
with
an
effort
the
welts
across
her
back
were
swollen
and
painful
deadwood
is
my
destination
i
can
deviate
my
course
however
if
it
will
accommodate
you
oh
no
you
must
not
inconvenience
yourself
on
my
account
i
am
of
little
or
no
consequence
you
know
she
leaned
upon
his
arm
and
they
ascended
the
path
to
the
plain
above
frank
horse
was
grazing
near
by
where
the
scarlet
youth
had
taken
his
unceremonious
tumble
off
to
the
a
cloud
of
dust
rose
heavenward
and
he
rightly
conjectured
that
it
hid
from
view
the
chieftain
sitting
bull
and
his
warriors
his
thoughts
reverting
to
his
companion
general
nix
and
the
train
of
charity
joe
he
glanced
toward
where
he
had
last
seen
them
neither
were
to
be
seen
now
probably
nix
had
rejoined
the
train
and
it
was
out
of
behind
a
swell
in
the
plains
were
you
looking
for
some
one
alice
asked
looking
into
her
rescuer
face
yes
i
was
with
a
train
when
i
first
heard
your
cries
i
left
the
boys
and
came
to
investigate
i
guess
they
have
gone
on
without
me
how
mean
of
them
will
we
have
to
make
the
journey
to
the
hills
alone
yes
unless
we
should
providentially
fall
in
with
a
train
or
be
overtaken
by
a
stage
are
you
not
afraid
my
cognomen
is
fearless
frank
lady
you
can
draw
conclusions
from
that
he
went
and
caught
the
horse
arranged
a
blanket
in
the
saddle
so
that
she
could
ride
and
assisted
her
to
mount
the
sun
was
touching
the
lips
of
the
horizon
with
a
golden
kiss
more
time
than
frank
had
supposed
had
elapsed
since
he
left
the
train
far
off
toward
the
east
shadows
were
hugging
close
behind
the
last
lingering
rays
of
sunlight
a
couple
of
coyotes
were
sneaking
into
view
a
few
rods
away
birds
were
winging
homeward
a
breeze
swept
down
from
the
black
hills
and
fanned
the
pink
cheeks
of
alice
terry
into
a
vivid
glow
we
can
not
go
far
said
frank
thoughtfully
before
darkness
will
overtake
us
perhaps
we
had
better
remain
in
the
canal
here
where
there
is
both
grass
and
water
in
the
morning
we
will
take
a
fresh
start
the
plan
was
adopted
they
camped
in
the
break
or
canal
near
where
alice
had
been
tortured
out
of
his
frank
brought
forth
crackers
biscuit
and
dried
venison
these
with
clear
sparkling
water
from
the
spring
in
the
chaparral
made
a
meal
good
enough
for
anybody
the
night
was
warm
no
fire
was
needed
a
blanket
spread
on
the
grass
served
as
a
for
alice
the
strange
youth
in
scarlet
lay
with
his
head
resting
against
the
side
of
his
horse
the
least
movement
of
the
animal
he
said
would
arouse
him
he
was
keen
of
scent
and
quick
to
detect
danger
meaning
the
horse
the
night
passed
away
without
incident
as
early
as
four
when
it
is
daylight
on
the
plains
fearless
frank
was
astir
be
found
the
rivulet
flowing
from
the
spring
to
abound
with
trout
and
caught
and
dressed
the
morning
meal
alice
was
awake
by
the
time
breakfast
was
ready
she
bathed
her
face
and
hands
in
the
stream
combed
her
long
auburn
hair
through
her
fingers
and
looked
sweeter
than
on
the
previous
night
at
least
so
thought
fearless
frank
the
day
promises
to
be
delightful
does
it
not
she
remarked
as
she
seated
herself
to
partake
of
the
repast
exactly
autumn
months
are
ever
enjoyable
in
the
west
the
meal
dispatched
no
delay
was
made
in
leaving
the
place
fearless
frank
strode
along
beside
his
horse
and
its
fair
rider
chatting
pleasantly
and
at
the
same
time
making
a
close
observation
of
his
surroundings
he
knew
he
was
in
parts
frequented
by
both
red
and
white
savages
and
it
would
do
no
harm
to
keep
on
one
guard
they
traveled
all
day
and
reached
sage
creek
at
sunset
here
they
remained
over
night
taking
an
early
start
on
the
succeeding
morning
that
day
they
made
good
progress
in
consequence
of
frank
purchase
of
a
horse
at
sage
creek
from
some
friendly
crow
indians
and
darkness
overtook
them
at
the
mouth
of
red
canyon
where
they
went
into
camp
by
steady
pushing
they
reached
rapid
creek
the
next
night
for
no
halt
was
made
at
custer
city
and
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
the
camped
with
a
miner
family
as
yet
no
cabins
or
shanties
had
been
erected
here
canvas
tents
serving
in
the
stead
there
are
between
fifty
and
a
hundred
wooden
structures
alice
was
charmed
with
the
wild
grandeur
of
the
mountain
scenery
with
the
countless
acres
of
blossoms
and
flowering
shrubs
with
the
romantic
and
picturesque
surroundings
in
general
and
was
very
emphatic
in
her
praises
one
day
of
rest
was
taken
at
rapid
creek
then
the
twain
pushed
on
and
when
night
again
overtook
them
they
rode
into
the
bustling
noisy
homely
metropolis
deadwood
magic
city
of
the
chapter
vi
only
a
snake
locating
a
mine
harry
redburn
hurried
off
toward
the
cabin
which
was
some
steps
away
in
anita
scream
there
were
both
terror
and
affright
walsingham
nix
the
explorer
and
prospecter
hobbled
after
him
using
his
staff
for
support
he
had
heard
the
scream
but
years
experience
among
the
gals
taught
him
that
a
feminine
shriek
rarely
if
ever
meant
anything
redburn
arrived
at
the
cabin
in
a
few
flying
bounds
and
leaped
into
the
kitchen
there
crouched
upon
the
floor
in
one
corner
all
in
a
little
heap
pale
tumbling
and
terrified
was
anita
before
her
squirming
along
over
the
floor
evidently
disabled
by
a
blow
was
an
enormous
it
was
creeping
away
instead
of
toward
anita
leaving
a
faint
trail
of
crimson
in
its
wake
yet
the
young
girl
face
was
blanched
with
fear
you
screamed
at
that
demanded
redburn
pointing
to
the
coiling
serpent
ugh
yes
it
is
horrible
but
it
is
harmless
see
some
one
has
given
it
a
blow
across
the
back
and
it
is
disabled
for
harm
anita
looked
up
into
his
handsome
face
wonderingly
i
guv
et
a
rap
across
the
spinal
column
when
i
kim
into
the

said

it
across

anita
screamed
again
as
she
saw
the
general
he
was
so
rough
and
homely
who
are
you
she
managed
to
articulate
as
redburn
assisted
her
to
rise
from
the
floor
what
are
you
doing
here
where
you
were
not
invited
there
was
a
degree
of
haughtiness
in
her
tone
that
redburn
did
not
dream
she
possessed
the
general
rubbed
the
end
of
his
nose
chuckled
audibly
then
laughed
outright

looked
at

doubtfully

be
very
angry
if
he
were
to

here
what
would

redburn
laughed
heartily
the
old

bravado
amused
him
anita
however
was
silent
she
put
dependence
in
her
protector
to
arrange
matters
satisfactorily
that
savors
strongly
of
rebellion
redburn
observed
sitting
down
upon
a
lounge
that
stood
hard
by
besides
you

you

expression
upon
his
genial
face
i
fail
to
see
how
that
has
any
reference
as
to

of

he

then
the

proceeded
with

guesses

and
continued
on
in
this
strain
so

i
went

an
swallered
a

about

whar
thet

secreted

in
a

pocket
beneath
the
bed
of
a
spring
frum
which
flowed
a
little
creeklet
next
mornin

an

i
shouldered

an
went

thet

traced
into
a
rich
vein
is
payin
as
big
or
bigger
nor
any
claim
on

creek
b
both
redburn
and
anita
were
unconsciously
becoming
interested
and
do
you
think
there
is
gold
here
in
this
i
do
think
it
i
know
it
i
hed
a
dreem
et

in

quantities

i
my

thet

precisely
where
ther
strike
ar
redburn
drummed
a
tattoo
on
the
arm
of
the
lounge
his
fingers
he
was
reflecting
on
what
he
had
heard
you
are
willing
to
make
terms
i
suppose
he
said
after
a
while
glancing
at
anita
to
see
if
he
was
right
you
are
aware
i
believe
that
we
still
hold
possession
above
any

else
true
enuff
ye
war

ter

this
place
ye
orter
hev
yer
say
about
it
well
then
perhaps
we
can
come
to
a
bargain
you
can
state
your
prices
for
locating
and
opening
up
this
mine
and
we
will
consider
wal
let
me
see
ef
the
mine
proves
to
be
ekal
ter
the
one
thet
i
located
on

creek
i

i

redburn
turned
to
anita
from
what
little
experience
i
have
had
i
think
it
is
a
fair
offer
what
is
your
view
of
the
matter
and
do
you
believe
your
brother
will
be
satisfied
oh
yes
sir
it
will
surprise
and
please
him
to
return
and
find
his
paradise
has
been
turned
into
a
all
right
then
we
will
go
ahead
and
get
things
to
shape
we
will
have
to
get
tools
though
before
we
can
accomplish
much
of
anything
my
brother
has
a
miner
outfit
here
said
anita
that
will
save
you
a
trip
to
deadwood
for
the
present
and
so
it
was
all
satisfactorily
arranged
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
the
old
general
and
redburn
wandered
about
through
the
of
the
pocket
here
and
there
examining
a
little
soil
now
chipping
rock
among
the
rugged
foothills
then
feeling
in
the
bed
of
the
creek
but
not
a
sign
of
anything
like
gold
was
to
be
found
and
when
night
called
them
to
shelter
redburn
was
pretty
thoroughly
convinced
that
nix
was
an
enormous
sell
and
that
he
could
put
all
the
gold
they
would
find
in
his
eye
the
general
however
was
confident
of
success
and
told
many
doubtful
yarns
of
former
discoveries
and
exploits
anita
prepared
an
evening
meal
that
was
both
tempting
and
sumptuous
and
all
satisfied
their
appetites
after
which
harry
took
down
the
guitar
suspended
from
the
wall
tuned
it
up
and
sung
in
a
clear
mellow
voice
a
number
of
ballads
to
which
the
general
much
to
the
surprise
of
both
redburn
and
anita
lent
a
rich
deep
bass
a
voice
of
superior
culture
the
closing
piece
was
a
weird
melody
the
lament
of
a
heart
that
was
broken
and
was
rendered
in
a
style
worthy
of
a
professional
vocalist
the
last
mournful
strains
filled
the
cabin
just
as
the
last
lingering
rays
of
sunlight
disappeared
from
the
mountain
top
and
shadows
came
creeping
down
the
rugged
walls
of
rock
to
concentrate
in
the
flower
pocket
as
anita
had
named
her
valley
home
redburn
rose
from
his
seat
at
the
window
and
reached
the
instrument
to
its
accustomed
shelf
darting
a
glance
toward
sad
anita
a
moment
later
to
his
surprise
he
perceived
that
her
head
was
bowed
upon
her
arm
that
lay
along
the
that
she
was
weeping
softly
to
herself
acting
the
gentlemanly
part
the
young
miner
motioned
for
nix
to
follow
him
and
they
both
retired
to
the
outside
of
the
cabin
to
lounge
on
the
grass
and
smoke
and
thus
anita
was
left
alone
with
her
grief
and
such
troubles
as
were
the
causes
thereof
certain
it
was
that
she
had
a
secret
but
what
it
was
redburn
could
not
guess
about
ten
he
and
nix
the
cabin
and
went
to
bed
in
a
room
allotted
to
them
off
from
the
little
parlor
both
went
to
sleep
at
once
and
it
was
well
along
toward
morning
when
redburn
was
aroused
by
being
rudely
shaken
by
general
nix
who
was
up
and
dressed
and
held
a
torch
in
his
hand
come
come
he
said
in
a
husky
whisper
and
a
glance
convinced
harry
that
he
was
still
asleep
although
his
eyes
were
wide
open
and
staring
without
a
word
the
young
man
leaped
from

deadwood
dick
on
the
road
rumbling
noisily
through
the
black
canyon
road
to
deadwood
at
an
hour
long
past
midnight
came
the
stage
from
cheyenne
loaded
down
with
passengers
and
full
five
hours
late
on
account
of
a
broken
shaft
which
had
to
be
replaced
on
the
road
there
were
six
plunging
snarling
horses
attached
whom
the
veteran
jehu
on
the
box
managed
with
the
skill
of
a
circusman
and
all
the
time
the
crack
snap
of
his
gad
made
the
night
resound
as
like
so
many
pistol
reports
the
road
was
through
a
wild
tortuous
canyon
fringed
with
tall
spectral
pines
which
occasionally
admitted
a
bar
of
ghostly
moonlight
across
the
rough
road
over
which
the
stage
tore
with
wild
recklessness
inside
the
vehicle
was
crammed
full
to
its
utmost
capacity
and
therefrom
emanated
the
strong
fumes
of
whisky
and
tobacco
smoke
and
stronger
language
over
the
delay
and
the
terrible
jolting
of
the
conveyance
in
addition
to
those
penned
up
inside
there
were
two
passengers
positioned
on
top
to
the
rear
of
the
driver
where
they
clung
to
the
trunk
railings
to
keep
from
being
jostled
off
one
was
an
elderly
man
tall
in
stature
and
noticeably
portly
with
a
florid
countenance
cold
gray
eyes
and
hair
and
beard
of
brown
freely
mixed
with
silvery
threads
he
was
elegantly
attired
his
costume
being
of
the
finest
cloth
and
of
the
very
latest
cut
boots
patent
leathers
and
hat
glossy
as
a
mirror
diamonds
gleamed
and
sparkled
on
his
immaculate
on
his
fingers
and
from
the
seal
of
a
heavy
gold
chain
across
his
vest
front
the
other
personage
was
a
counterpart
of
the
first
to
every
particular
save
that
while
one
was
more
than
a
to
years
the
other
was
barely
twenty
the
same
faultless
elegance
in
dress
the
same
elaborate
display
of
jewels
and
the
same
haughty
aristocratic
bearing
produced
in
one
was
mirrored
to
the
other
they
were
father
and
son
confound
such
a
road
growled
the
younger
man
as
the
stage
bounced
him
about
like
a
rubber
ball
for
my
part
i
wish
i
had
remained
at
home
instead
of
coming
out
into
this
outlandish
region
it
is
perfectly
awful
chattered
the
elder
between
the
jolts
and
jerks
it
is
not
what
it
should
be
that
true
but
have
patience
ere
long
we
will
reach
our
destination
and
get
shot
like
poor
vansevere
did
sneered
the
other
i
tell
you
governor
this
is
a
desperate
game
you
are
playing
the
old
man
smiled
grimly
desperate
or
not
we
must
carry
it
through
to
the
end
vansevere
was
not
the
right
kind
of
a
man
to
set
after
the
young
scamp
how
do
you
mean
he
was
too
rash
entirely
too
rash
deadwood
dick
is
a
daring
whelp
and
vansevere
open
offer
of
a
reward
for
his
apprehension
only
put
the
young
tiger
on
his
guard
and
he
will
be
more
wary
and
watchful
in
the
future
this
in
a
positive
tone
yes
he
will
be
harder
to
trap
than
a
fox
who
has
lost
a
foot
between
jaws
of
steel
he
will
be
revengeful
too
bah
i
fear
him
not
old
as
i
am
he
is
but
a
boy
in
years
you
remember
and
will
be
easily
managed
i
hope
so
i
do
want
my
brains
blown

lashed
his

the

deeper

and
darker

slightly
descending
the

of

above

staring

alexander

succeeded
in
steadying
himself
long
enough
to
ignite
the
end
of
a
cigar
to
the
bowl
of

pipe
then
he
watched
the
trees
that
flitted
by
clarence
his
son
had
smoked
incessantly
since
leaving

crook
and
now
threw
away
his
cheroot

of

spectral

the

what
about
her
he
asked
after
some
moments
had
elapsed
she
will
be
as
much
to
the
way
as
the
boy
will
she
well
we
attend
to
her
after
we
git
him
out

he
is
the
worst
obstacle

you

the
two

on

of
the

shiver
with
dread
and
even
old
bill
mcgucken
peers
around
him
a
trifle
suspiciously
it
is
a
wild
spot
with
the
mountains
rising
on
each
side
of
the
road
to
a
stupendous
hight
the
towering
pines
moaning
their

eternal

moment
conducive

mute
wonder
admiration
high
above
all

sounds
now
rings
this
cry
borne
toward
the
advancing
stage
from
the
impenetrable
space
of
gloom
ahead
brought
down
in
clear
commanding
tone
whereto
there
is
neither
fear
nor
hesitation
that
one
word
has
marvelous
effect
it
brings
a
gripe
of
iron
into
the
hands
of
jehu
and
he
jerks
his
snorting
steeds
back
upon
their
haunches
it
is
instrumental
in
stopping
the
stage
who
ever
knew
a
black
hills
driver
to
offer
to
press
on
when
challenged
to
halt
to
a
wild
dismal
place
it
sends
a
thrill
of
lonely
horror
through
the
vein
of
those
to
whose
ears
the
cry
is
borne
it
causes
hands
to
fly
to
the
butts
of
weapons
and
hearts
to
beat
faster
halt
again
the
cry
rings
forth
reverberating
in
a
hundred
dissimilar
echoes
up
the
rugged
mountain
side
the
horses
quiet
down
jehu
sits
like
a
carved
statue
on
his
box
the
silence
becomes
painful
to
those
within
the
stage
those
who
are
trembling
in
a
fever
of
excitement
and
peering
from
the
open
windows
with
revolvers
cocked
for
instant
use
the
moon
suddenly
thrusts
her
golden
head
over
the
pinnacle
of
a
hoary
peak
a
thousand
feet
above
and
lights
up
the
gorge
with
a
ghastly
distinctness
that
enables
the
watchers
to
behold
a
black
horseman
blocking
the
path
a
few
rods
ahead
silence
listen
two
words
this
time
in
the
same
clear
commanding
voice
a
pause
of
a
moment
then
the
stillness
is
broken
by
the
ominous
click
click
of
a
score
of
rifles
this
alone
announces
that
the
stage
is
covered
then
the
lone
horseman
rides
leisurely
down
toward
the
stage
and
jehu
recognizes
him
it
is
deadwood
dick
prince
of
the
road
mounted
upon
his
midnight
steed
and
clad
in
his
weird
suit
of
black
he
makes
an
imposing
spectacle
as
he
comes
fearlessly
up
well
may
he
be
bold
and
fearless
for
no
one
dares
to
raise
a
hand
against
him
when
the
glistening
barrels
of
twelve
rifles
protruding
from

thicket
that
fringes

threaten
those

down

were

away
rolled
the
jolting
stage
through
the
black
canyon
disappearing
a
moment
later
around
the
bend
beyond
which
lay
deadwood
magic
city
of
the
wilderness
then
out
from
the
thicket
the
led
their
horses
the
two
prisoners
were
secured
in
the
saddles
in
front
of
two
brawny
outlaws
and
without
delay
the
cavalcade
moved
down
the
gorge
weirdly
illuminated
by
the
mellow
rays
of
the
soaring
moon
clarence
filmore
had
hoped
that
the
report
of
his
would
reach
deadwood
if
so
his
wishes
were
fulfilled
the
reports
reached
the
barracks
above
deadwood
just
as
a
horseman
galloped
up
the
hill
major
r
just
in
from
a
carouse
down
at
the
met
halloo
he
shouted
loudly
to
horse
there
is
trouble
in
the
gorge
the
sioux
under
sitting
bull
are
upon
us
as
the
major
word
was
law
at
the
barracks
in
very
short
order
the
garrison
was
aroused
and
headed
by
the
major
in
person
a
cavalcade
of
sleepy
soldiers
swept
down
the
gorge
toward
the
place
whence
had
come
the
firing
wildly
around
the
abrupt
bend
they
dashed
with
yells
of
anticipated
victory
then
there
was
a
frightful
collision
between
the
incoming
stage
and
the
outgoing
cavalry
the
shrieks
and
screams
of
horses
the
curses
and
yells
of
wounded
men
and
a
general
pandemonium
ensued
the
coach
passengers
horses
and
all
was
upset
and
went
rolling
down
a
steep
embankment
major
r
was
precipitated
headlong
over
the
embankment
and
in
his
downward
flight
probably
saw
more
than
one
soaring
comet
he
struck
in
a
muddy
run
and
a
officer
of
the
was
never
before
seen
in
the
black
hills
as
he
emerged
from
his
bath
than
the
major
his
ridiculous
appearance
went
so
far
as
to
stay
the
general
torrent
of
blasphemy
and
turn
it
into
a
channel
of
boisterous
laughter
no
delay
was
made
in
putting
things
again
and
ere
morning
dawned
deadwood
beheld
the
returned
soldiers
and
wrecked
stage
with
its
sullen
passengers
within
its
precincts
dick
and
his
men
rode
rapidly
down
the
canyon
the
two
prisoners
bringing
up
the
rear
under
the
escort
of
two
masked
guards
these
guards
were
brothers
and
at
that
the
elder
filmore
a
keen
student
of
character
was
not
long
in
making
out
these
spaniards
true
character
nor
did
their
greedy
glances
toward
his
and
his
son
diamonds
escape
him
we
want
to
get
free
he
at
last
whispered
when
none
of
those
ahead
were
glancing
back
you
will
each
receive
a
cool
five
hundred
apiece
if
you
will
set
us
at
liberty
the
two
exchanged
glances
it
a
bargain
returned
one
stop
your
horses
and
let
the
others
go
on
the
main
party
were
at
this
juncture
riding
swiftly
down
a
steep
grade
the
four
horses
were
quietly
reined
in
and
when
the
others
were
out
of
hearing
their
noses
were
turned
back
up
the
canyon
in
the
direction
of
deadwood
this
will
be
an
unhealthy
job
for
us
said
one
of
the
brothers
should
we
ever
meet
dick
again
fear
him
not
replied
alexander
filmore
with
an
oath
if
he
ever
crosses
your
path
shoot
him
down
like
a
dog
and
i
give
you
a
thousand
dollars
for
the
work
the
sooner
he
dies
the
better

be
suited
he
spoke
in
a
tone
of
strongest
hate
deepest
rancor
chapter
ix
at
the
met
a
few
nights
subsequent
to
the
events
related
in
our
last
chapter
it
becomes
our
duty
to
again
visit
the
notorious
metropolitan
saloon
of
deadwood
to
see
what
is
going
on
there
as
usual
everything
around
the
place
and
in
it
is
literally
red
hot
the
bars
are
constantly
crowded
the
are
never
empty
and
the
floor
is
so
full
of
surging
humanity
that
the
dance
formerly
a
chief
attraction
has
necessarily
been
suspended
the
influx
of
pilgrims
into
the
black
hills
for
the
last
few
days
has
been
something
more
than
wonderful
every
stage
coming
in
overcharged
with
feverish
passengers
and
from
two
to
a
dozen
trains
arriving
daily
of
course
deadwood
receives
a
larger
share
of
all
this
immigration
nothing
is
more
natural
for
the
young
metropolis
of
the
hills
is
miner
rendezvous
being
in
the
center
of
the
best
yielding
locates
every
person
in
deadwood
can
tell
you
where
the
met
is
as
it
is
general
we
mount
the
steps
and
disappear
behind
the
screen
that
stands
in
front
of
the
door
then
the
merry
clink
of
glasses
snatches
of
ribald
song
and
loud
curses
from
the
polluted
lips
of
some
wretch
who
has
lost
heavily
at
the
reach
our
hearing
while
our
gaze
wanders
over
as
motley
a
crowd
as
it
has
ever
been
our
fortune
to
behold
men
from
the
states
lawyers
doctors
speculators
adventurers
pilgrims
and
men
from
the
western
side
of
the
missouri
grisly
miners
from
colorado
hunters
and
trappers
from
idaho
and
wyoming
card
sharps
from
denver
and
pickpockets
from
joe
and
bummers
from
omaha
all
are
here
each
one
a
part
of
a
strange
and
on
the
whole
a
very
undesirable
community
although
the
dance
has
been
suspended
that
does
not
necessitate
the
discharge
of
the
girls
and
they
may
yet
be
seen
here
with
the
rest
mingling
freely
among
the
crowd
seated
at
a
table
in
a
somewhat
retired
corner
were
two
persons
engaged
at
cards
one
was
a
beardless
youth
attired
in
and
armed
with
knife
and
pistols
the
other
a
big
burly
tough
from
the
upper
chain
grisly
bloated
and
repulsive
he
too
was
nothing
short
of
a
walking
arsenal
and
it
was
plain
to
see
that
he
was
a
desperate
character
the
game
was
poker
the
youth
had
won
three
straight
games
and
now
laid
down
the
cards
that
ended
the
fourth
in
his
favor
you
flaxed
pardner
he
said
with
a
light
laugh
as
he
raked
in
the
stakes
this
takes
your

said
the

the

and
he
laid

the
ruffian
hands
there
now
go
ahead
with
your
funeral
your
deal
the
cards
were
dealt
and
the
game
played
resulting
in
the
favor
of
the
cattymount
another
and
another
was
played
and
the
tough
won
every
time
still
the
youth
kept
on
a
quiet
smile
resting
on
his
pleasant
features
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
the
youth

exclaimed
a
voice

and
the
two
players
looked
up
to
see
ned
harris
standing
near
by
with
his
hands
clasped
across
his
breast
calamity
jane
nodded
indifferently
she
had
seen
the
young
miner
on
several
occasions
once
she
had
been
rendered
an
invaluable
service
when
he
rescued
her
from
a
brawl
in
which
a
dozen
toughs
had
attacked
her
cattymount
cass
brother
of
chet
diamond
the
deadwood
recognized
him
also
and
with
an
oath
sprung
to
his

roared
the
cattymount
spreading
himself
about
promiscuously
but
the
two
words
had
scarcely
left
his
lips
when
a
blow
from
the
fist
of
ned
harris
reached
him
under
the
left
eye
and
he
went
sprawling
on
the
ground
in
a
heap
here
here
roared
a
stranger
rushing
in
upon
the
scene
and
hurling
the
crowd
aside
with
a
dexterity
something
wonderful
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
who
knocked
cass
diamond
down
i
had
that
honor
coolly
remarked
ned
harris
stepping
boldly
up
and
confronting
the
deadwood
for
it
was
the
notorious
chet

who
had
asked
the
question
i
smacked
him
in
the
gob
chet

for
calling
me
a

cried
calamity

leaping
to
the
miner
side
a
cocked
six
in
either
white
shapely
hand
so
sail
in
pilgrims
diamond
cowered
back
and
swore
furiously
the
wound
in
his
breast
was
yet
sore
and
rankling
and
he
knew
he
owed
it
to
the
cool
and
calculating
young
miner
whose
name
was
an
omen
of
terror
among
toe
toughs
of
deadwood
come
on
you
ace
thief
shouted
calamity
jane
thrusting
the
muzzle
of
one
of
her
plated
revolvers
forcibly
under
the
gambler
prominent
nose
come
on
slide
in
if
you
are

hid
up

sleeves
the
card
sharp
still
cursed
furiously
and
backed
away
he
dare
not
reach
for
a
weapon
lest
the
girl
or
young
harris
who
now
held
a
cocked
in
each
hand
should
salt
him
on
a
full
lay
ha
ha
ha
and
the
laugh
of
calamity
rung
wildly
through
the
great
saloon
ha
ha
ha
here
a
go
who
wants
to
buy
a
sharp
sold
out
right
cheap
added
ned
facetiously
clear
the
track
and
we
take
him
out
and
boost
him
to
a
limb
at
this
juncture
some
half
a
dozen
of
the
gambler
gang
came
rushing
up
headed
by
catamount
cass
who
had
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
blow
from
harris
fist
at
them
at
roared
the
screechin
cattymount
frum
up
nor
rip
dig
an
gouge
ho
ho
we
see
now
who
swing
will
we
who
display
his
agility
in
we
will
at
at
we
hang
like
they
do
down
at
cheyenne
then
followed
a
pitched
battle
in
the
of
the
metropolitan
saloon
such
as
probably
never
occurred
there
before
and
never
has
since
revolvers
flashed
on
every
hand
knives
clashed
in
deadly
conflict
yells
wild
savage
and
awful
made
a
perfect
pandemonium
to
which
was
added
a
second
edition
in
the
shape
of
oaths
curses
and
groans
crack
whiz
bang
the
bullets
flew
about
like
hailstones
and
men
fell
to
the
reeking
floor
each
terrible
moment
the
two
friends
were
not
alone
in
the
affray
no
sooner
had
catamount
cass
and
his
gang
of
toughs
showed
fight
than
a
company
of
miners
sprung
to
harris
side
and
showed
their
willingness
to
fight
it
out
on
the
square
line
therefore
once
the
first
shot
was
fired
it
needed
not
a
word
to
pitch
the
battle
fiercely
waged
the
contest
now
hand
to
hand
loud
rose
the
savage
yells
on
the
still
night
air
one
by
one
men
fell
on
either
side
their
crimsoning
the
floor
their
dying
groans
unheeded
in
the
fearful
melee
still
unharmed
and
fighting
among
the
first
we
see
ned
harris
and
his
remarkable
companion
calamity
jane
both
are
black
and
scarcely
recognizable
in
the
cloud
of
smoke
that
fills
the
harris
is
wounded
in
a
dozen
places
and
weak
from
loss
of
blood
yet
he
stands
up
bravely
and
fights
mechanically
calamity
jane
if
she
is
wounded
shows
it
not
but
faces
the
music
with
as
little
apparent
fear
as
any
of
those
around
her
on
wages
the
battle
even
as
furiously
as
in
its
beginning
the
last
shot
has
been
fired
it
is
now
knife
to
knife
and
face
to
face
full
as
many
of
one
side
as
the
other
have
fallen
and
lay
strewn
about
under
foot
unthought
of
uncared
for
in
the
excitement
of
the
desperate
moment
gallons
of
blood
have
made
the
floor
slippery
and
reeking
so
that
it
is
difficult
to
retain
one
footing
at
the
head
of
the
ruffians
the
diamond
brothers
c
still
hold
sway
fighting
like
madmen
in
their
endeavors
to
win
a
victory
they
can
not
do
less
for
to
back
off
in
this
critical
moment
means
sure
death
to
the
weakening
party
but
hark
what
are
these
sounds
the
thunder
of
hoofs
is
heard
outside
the
rattle
of
musketry
and
sabers
and
the
next
instant
a
company
of
soldiery
headed
by
major
r
ride
straight
up
into
the
saloon
firing
right
and
left
come
cried
calamity
jane
grasping
harris
by
the
arm
and
pulling
him
toward
a
side
door
it
time
for
us
to
slope
now
it
every
man
for
himself
and
only
under
her
guidance
was
ned
able
to
escape
and
save
being
tailed
and
captured
with
the
rest
about
noon
of
the
succeeding
day
two
persons
on
horseback
were
coming
along
the
north
gulch
leading
into
deadwood
at
an
easy
canter
they
were
the
fearless
scarlet
boy
or
as
he
is
better
known
fearless
frank
and
his
lovely
protege
miss
terry
they
had
been
for
a
morning
ride
over
to
a
neighboring
claim
and
were
just
returning
since
their
arrival
in
deadwood
the
youth
had
devoted
a
part
of
his
time
in
a
search
for
alice
father
but
all
to
no
avail
none
of
the
citizens
of
deadwood
or
its
surroundings
had
ever
heard
of
such
a
person
as
captain
walter
terry
the
young
couple
had
become
fast
friends
from
their
association
and
alice
was
improving
in
looks
every
day
she
stayed
in
the
mountains
i
feel
hungry
observed
frank
as
they
rode
along
this
life
in
the
hills
gives
me
a
keen
appetite
how
is
it
with
you
lady
the
same
as
with
you
i
guess
but
look
yonder
comes
a
horseman
toward
us
it
was
even
so
a
horseman
was
galloping
up
the
gulch
no
other
than
our
young
friend
ned
harris
as
the
two
parties
approach
the
faces
of
each
of
the
youths
grow
deadly
pale
there
comes
into
their
eyes
an
ominous
glitter
their
hands
each
clasp
the
butt
of
a
revolver
and
they
gradually
draw
rein
that
they
are
enemies
of
old
that
the
fire
of
rancor
burns
in
their
hearts
and
that
this
meeting
is
unexpected
is
plain
to
see
now
that
they
have
met
probably
for
the
first
time
in
months
or
years
it
remains
not
to
be
doubted
but
a
settlement
must
come
between
them
that
their
hate
must
result
in
satisfaction
whether
in
blood
or
not
chapter
x
the
duel
and
its
result
belligerent
were
the
glances
exchanged
between
the
two
as
they
sat
there
facing
each
other
each
with
a
hand
closed
over
the
butt
of
a
pistol
each
as
motionless
as
a
carved
statue
alice
terry
had
grown
pale
too
she
saw
that
friend
and
protector
and
the
stranger
were
enemies
that
this
meeting
though
purely
accidental
was
not
to
end
without
trouble
her
lips
grew
set
her
eyes
flashed
and
she
reined
her
horse
closer
to
that
of
the
scarlet
boy
ned
harris
let
a
faint
smile
of
contempt
and
pity
combined
come
into
relief
on
his
lips
as
he
saw
this
action
better
ten
male
enemies
than
one
female
he
thought
but
then
women
must
not
stand
in
the
way
now
no
nothing
must
block
the
path
intervening
between
enmity
and
vengeance
harris
was
if
anything
the
coolest
of
the
three
but
after
all
why
should
he
not
be
he
had
spent
several
years
in
society
that
seemed
callous
to
fear
that
knew
not
what
it
was
to
be
a
christian
where
the
utmost
coolness
was
necessary
to
the
preservation
of
life
where
bravery
was
all
and
education
a
dead
letter
fearless
frank
too
had
seen
all
phases
of
rough
western
life
probably
but
his
temperament
was
more
nervous
and
excitable
his
passions
tenfold
harder
to
restrain
still
he
managed
to
exercise
a
cool
exterior
now
that
equaled
that
of
his
opposite
his
hated
enemy
mystery
as
frank
habitually
called
the
girl
did
not
offer
to
conceal
her
feelings
it
was
but
natural
that
she
should
side
with
him
to
whom
she
owed
her
life
and
the
glances
of
scorn
and
indignation
she
shot
at
the
young
miner
might
have
driven
another
man
than
him
into
a
retreat
fearless
frank
made
no
motion
toward
speech
he
was
determined
that
the
young
miner
should
open
the
quarrel
if
a
quarrel
it
was
to
be
but
beneath
his
lips
were
clenched
two
rows
of
teeth
tightly
fiercely
while
every
nerve
in
the
youth
body
was
drawn
to
its
utmost
tension
harris
was
wonderfully
calm
and
at
ease
only
a
gray
pallor
on
his
handsome
face
and
a
menacing
fire
in
his
piercing
eyes
told
that
he
was
in
the
least
agitated
justin
mckenzie
sternly
rung
out
the
words
on
the
clear
mountain
air
ned
harris
had
spoken
and
the
grayish
pallor
deepened
on
his
countenance
while
the
fire
of
rancor
burned
with
stronger
gleam
in
his
eagle
eye
the
effect
on
the
scarlet
youth
was
scarcely
noticeable
more
than
that
the
lips
grew
more
rigid
and
compressed
and
the
right
hand
clutched
the
more
tightly
but
no
answer
to
the
summons
justin
mckenzie
again
said
the
young
miner
calmly
do
you
recognize
me
the
scarlet
boy
bows
his
head
slowly
his
eyes
watchful
lest
the
other
shall
catch
the
drop
on
him
justin
mckenzie
you
recognize
me
even
after
the
elapse
of
two
long
weary
years
during
which
i
have
sought
for
you
faithfully
but
failed
to
find
you
until
this
hour
we
have
at
last
met
and
the
time
for
settlement
between
you
and
me
justin
mckenzie
has
arrived
here
in
this
gorge
we
will
settle
the
grudge
i
hold
against
you
we
will
see
who
shall
live
and
who
shall
die
alice
terry
uttered
a
terrified
cry
oh
no
no
you
must
not
fight
you
not
it
is
bad
oh
so
awful
wicked
excuse
me
lady
but
you
will
have
no
voice
in
this
matter
and
the
miner
tone
grew
a
trifle
more
severe
knew
you
the
bitter
wrong
done
me
by
this
young
devil
with
the
smooth
face
and
oily
tongue
if
you
knew
what
a
righteous
cause
i
have
to
defend
you
would
say
the
battle
proceed
i
am
not
one
to
thirst
for
the
blood
of
my
but
i
one
that
is
ever
ready
to
raise
my
hand
and
strike
in
the
defense
of
women
alice
terry
secretly
admired
the
stalwart
young
miner
for
this
gallant
speech
fearless
frank
his
face
paler
than
before
an
expression
of
remorse
combined
with
anguish
about
his
countenance
and
moisture
standing
in
either
eye
assumed
his
attitude
as
he
answered
edward
harris
if
you
will
listen
i
will
say
all
i
have
to
say
in
a
very
few
words
you
hate
me
because
of
a
wrong
i
did
you
and
yours
and
you
want
my
life
for
the
forfeit
i
shall
not
hinder
you
longer
to
your
purpose
for
two
long
years
you
have
trailed
and
tracked
me
with
the
determination
of
a
bloodhound
and
i
have
evaded
you
not
that
i
was
at
all
afraid
of
you
but
because
i
did
not
wish
to
make
you
a
murderer
i
have
come
across
your
path
at
last
here
let
us
settle
as
you
have
said
see
i
fold
my
arms
across
my
breast
take
out
your
pistol
aim
steadily
and
fire
twice
at
my
breast
i
have
heard
enough
concerning
your
skill
as
a
marksman
to
feel
confident
that
you
can
kill
me
in
two
shots
ned
harris
flushed
angrily
he
was
surprised
at
the
cool
indifference
and
recklessness
of
the
youth
he
was
angered
that
mckenzie
should
think
mean
enough
to
take
such
a
preposterous
advantage
you
are
a
fool
he
sneered
biting
his
lip
with
vexation
do
you
calculate
i
am
a
i
have
no
proof
that
you
are
or
that
you
are
replied
fearless
frank
controlling
his
temper
by
a
master
effort
you
remember
i
have
not
kept
a
watch
upon
your
actions
be
that
as
it
may
i
would
be
an
accursed
dog
to
take
advantage
of
your
insulting
proposal
you
must
fight
me
the
same
as
i
shall
fight
you
no
ned
harris
i
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
it
is
i
who
have
wronged
you
and
yours
you
must
take
the
offensive
i
will
play
a
silent
hand
you
refuse
to
fight
me
i
refuse
to
fight
you
but
do
refuse
to
give
you
satisfaction
for
what
wrong
you
have
suffered
take
my
life
if
you
choose
it
is
yours
take
it
or
forever
after
this
consider
our
debt
of
hatred
canceled
and
let
us
be
friends
never
justin
mckenzie
you
forget
the
stain
dyed
by
your
hand
that
will
never
washout
no
no
god
knows
i
do
not
forget
and
the
youth
voice
was
hoarse
with
anguish
could
it
be
undone
i
would
gladly
undo
the
deed
but
tell
me
harris
about
does
she
still
live
yes
if
you
can
call
staying
living
life
is
but
a
blank
better
she
had
died
ere
she
ever
met
you
you
speak
truly
better
she
had
died
ere
she
met
me
unconsciously
the
two
had
ridden
closer
to
each
other
had
they
forgotten
themselves
in
recalling
the
past
she
lives
may
live
on
her
lonely
life
for
years
to
come
harris
resumed
thoughtfully
but
her
life
will
be
merely
endurance
will
you
tell
me
where
where
i
can
go
in
secret
and
take
but
one
look
at
her
if
you
will
do
this
i
will
agree
to
meet
you
and
give
you
your
chance
for
satis
no
thundered
harris
growing
suddenly
furious
a
thousand
times
i
sooner
see
her
in
the
burning
depths
of
the
bottomless
pit
than
have
you
get
within
a
hundred
miles
of
her
with
your
contaminating
presence
she
is
safely
hidden
away
and
that
forever
from
the
companionship
of
our
sex
so
let
her
be
till
death
claims
her
you
are
too
hard
on
her
and
not
hard
enough
on
you
base
villain
that
your
are
who
is
this
young
lady
you
have
to
your
company
another
of
your
victims
hold
edward
harris
enough
of
your
vile
insinuations
this
lady
is
one
whom
i
rescued
from
sitting
bull
the
sioux
and
i
am
helping
her
to
hunt
a
father
who
she
says
is
somewhere
in
the
black
hills
your
language
should
at
least
be
respectful
the
rebuke
stung
young
harris
to
the
quick
but
he
reined
in
his
passion
to
a
moment
and
doffed
his
hat
pardon
me
miss
pardon
me
it
was
ungentlemanly
for
me
to
speak
as
i
did
but
i
was
surprised
at
seeing
one
of
your
sex
in
company
with
this
accomplished
scamp
justin
mckenzie
my
presence
with
him
is
as
he
said
for
the
purpose
of
finding
my
father
he
rescued
me
from
the
indians
and
has
volunteered
his
services
for
which
i
am
very
thankful
so
far
sir
he
has
acted
in
a
courteous
and
gentlemanly
manner
toward
me
said
alice
terry
what
he
may
have
been
heretofore
concerns
me
not
as
you
must
know
he
is
always
that
until
he
has
lured
his
victim
to
ruin
retorted
ned
bitterly
beware
of
him
lady
for
he
is
a
rattlesnake
in
the
disguise
of
a
butterfly
fearless
frank
grew
livid
at
this
last
thrust
forbearance
is
virtue
sometimes
but
not
always
in
his
case
the
scarlet
boy
felt
that
he
could
bear
the
taunts
of
the
miner
no
longer
you
are
a
liar
and
a
dastard
he
cried
fiercely
come
on
if
you
wish
satisfaction
and
i
give
it
to
you
i
am
ready
always
sir
i
challenged
you
first
you
have
the
choice
retorted
ned
as
cool
as
ever
while
his
enemy
was
all
trembling
with
excitement
pistols
at
fifty
yards
to
be
fired
until
one
or
the
other
is
dead
was
the
prompt
decision
good
young
lady
you
will
necessarily
have
to
act
as
second
for
both
of
us
if
i
drop
leave
my
body
where
i
fall
and
it
will
be
picked
up
by
friends
if
he
falls
i
will
ride
on
to
deadwood
and
send
you
out
help
to
carry
him
in
without
delay
the
distance
was
guessed
at
and
each
of
the
young
men
rode
to
position
miss
terry
the
beautiful
second
took
her
place
at
one
side
of
the
gulch
midway
between
the
antagonists
and
when
all
was
to
readiness
she
counted
one
the
right
hands
of
the
two
youths
were
raised
on
a
level
and
the
gleaming
barrel
of
a
pistol
shone
from
each
two
there
was
a
sharp
click
click
as
the
hammers
of
the
weapons
were
pulled
back
at
full
cock
each
click
meant
danger
or
death
harris
was
very
white
so
was
fearless
frank
but
not
so
much
so
as
the
young
woman
who
was
to
give
the
signal
three
cried
alice
quickly
then
there
was
a
flash
the
report
of
two
pistols
and
ned
harris
fell
to
the
ground
without
a
groan
mckenzie
ran
to
his
side
and
bent
over
him
poor
fellow
he
murmured
rising
a
few
moments
later
poor
ned
is
dead
it
was
harris
request
to
be
left
where
he
fell
accordingly
he
was
laid
on
the
grass
by
the
roadside
his
horse
tethered
near
by
and
then
accompanied
by
alice
justin
mckenzie
set
out
to

we

the

once
more
back
to
the
pocket

the
date
is
one
month
later
one
long
eventful
month
since
justin

shot
down
ned

under
the
noonday
sun
a
short
distance
above
deadwood
returning
to
the
flower
pocket
by
the
route
to
the
rugged
transverse
gulch
and
thence
through
the
gaping
fissure
we
find
before
us
a
scene
not
of
slumbering
beauty
but
of
active
industry
and
labor
such
as
was
not
here
when
we
last
looked
into
the
paradise
of
the
hills
the
flowers
are
for
the
most
part
still
intact
though
occasionally
you
will
come
across
a
spot
where
the
hand
of
man
hath
blighted
their
growth
where
stood
the
little
cabin
now
may
be
seen
a
larger
and
more
commodious
log
structure
which
is
but
a
continuation
of
the
original
a
busy
scene
greets
our
gaze
all
around
men
are
hurrying
here
and
there
through
the
valley
men
not
of
the
race
but
of
the
red
race
men
clad
only
to
the
waist
with
remarkable
muscular
developments
and
fleetness
of
foot
over
the
little
creek
which
dashes
far
adown
from
mountain
peaks
and
trails
its
shining
waters
through
the
flowering
land
is
built
another
structure
of
logs
strongly
and
carefully
erected
and
thatched
by
a
master
hand
with
bark
and
grass
from
the
roof
projects
a
small
from
which
emanates
a
steady
cloud
of
smoke
curling
lazily
upward
toward
heaven
blue
vault
and
inside
is
heard
the
grinding
crushing
rumble
of
ponderous
machinery
and
we
rightly
conjecture
that
it
is
a
crusher
in
full
operation
across
from
the
northern
side
of
the
gulch
comes
a
steady
string
of
mules
in
line
each
pulling
behind
him
a
or
what
is
better
known
to
the
general
reader
as
a
heavily
laden
with
huge
quartz
rocks
these
are
dumped
in
front
of
one
of
the
large
doorways
of
the
crusher
and
the
empties
return
mechanically
and
disappear
within
a
gaping
fissure
in
the
very
mountain
side
a
sort
of
tunnel
which
the
hand
of
man
aided
by
that
great
and
stronger
arm
powder
has
burrowed
and
blasted
out
all
this
is
under
the
immediate
management
of
the
whose
faces
declare
them
to
be
a
remnant
of
the
once
great
ute
tribe
now
utilized
to
a
better
occupation
than
in
the
dark
and
bloody
days
of
the
past
near
the
crusher
building
is
a
large
windlass
worked
by
mule
power
and
every
few
moments
there
comes
up
to
the
surface
from
the
depths
of
a
shaft
a
bucketful
of
rock
and
sand
which
is
dumped
into
a
and
from
thence
transferred
to
the
line
of
in
the
stream
where
more
utes
are
busily
engaged
in
sifting
golden
particles
from
the
rich
sand
what
a
transformation
is
all
this
since
we
left
the
flower
pocket
a
little
over
a
month
ago
now
everywhere
within
those
majestic
walls
is
bustle
and
excitement
then
the
valley
was
sleeping
away
the
calm
autumnal
days
unconscious
of
the
mines
of
wealth
lying
nestling
in
its
bosom
and
content
and
happy
in
its
quietude
and
the
adornments
of
nature
beauties
now
shouts
ringing
halloos
angry
curses
at
the
obstinate
mules
the
rumbling
of
ponderous
machinery
the
clink
of
picks
and
reports
of
frequent
blasts
the
deadened
sound
of
escaping
steam
the
barking
of
dogs
the
whining
of
horses
all
these
sounds
are
now
to
be
heard
then
the
valley
was
peacefully
at
rest
the
birds
chimed
in
their
exquisite
music
to
the
æolian
music
of
the
breeze
through
the
branches
of
the
mountain
pines
the
waters
pouring
adown
from
the
stupendous
peaks
created
an
everlasting
song
of
love
and
constancy
bees
and
drank
delicious
draughts
from
the
blushing
lips
of
a
million
nodding
flowers
the
sun
was
more
hazy
and
everything
had
an
appearance
of
ethereal
peace
and
happiness
but
like
a
drama
on
the
stage
a
grand
transformation
had
taken
place
a
beautiful
dream
had
been
changed
into
stern
reality
quietude
and
slumber
had
fled
at
the
bold
approach
of
bustling
industry
and
life
and
all
this
transformation
is
due
to
whom
the
noonday
sun
shone
down
on
all
the
busy
scene
with
a
glance
of
warmth
and
affection
and
particularly
did
its
rays
center
about
two
men
who
standing
on
the
southern
side
of
the
valley
up
in
among
the
rugged
foothills
were
watching
the
living
panorama
with
the
keenest
interest
they
were
harry
redburn
and
the
queer
old
little
locator
general
walsingham
nix
redburn
was
now
looking
nearly
as
rough
unkempt
and
grizzled
as
any
veteran
miner
and
for
a
bet
he
actually
had
not
waxed
the
ends
of
his
fine
mustache
for
over
a
week
but
there
was
more
of
a
healthy
glow
upon
his
face
a
robustness
about
his
form
and
a
light
of
satisfaction
in
his
eye
which
told
that
the
rough
miner
life
agreed
with
him
exceedingly
well
the
old
general
was
all
dirt
life
and
animation
and
as
full
of
his
eccentricities
as
ever
he
was
a
character
seldom
met
with
ever
full
of
a
quaint
humor
and
sociability
but
never
known
to
get
mad
no
matter
how
great
the
provocation
might
be
his
chance
strike
upon
the
spot
where
lay
the
gold
of
flower
pocket
imbedded
if
it
could
be
called
a
chance
considering
his
dream
was
the
prelude
to
the
opening
up
of
one
of
the
richest
mining
districts
south
of
deadwood
we
left
them
after
harry
had
driven
a
stake
to
mark
the
place
which
the
somnambulist
had
pointed
out
as
indicating
the
concealed
mine
on
the
succeeding
day
the
two
men
set
to
work
and
dug
long
and
desperately
to
uncover
the
treasure
and
after
three
days
of
incessant
toil
they
were
rewarded
with
success
a
rich
vein
of
gold
or
rather
a
deposit
of
the
valuable
metal
was
found
it
being
formed
in
a
deep
natural
pocket
and
mixed
alternately
with
sand
and
rock
during
the
remaining
four
days
of
that
week
the
two
lucky
miners
took
out
enough
gold
to
evidence
their
supposition
that
they
had
struck
one
of
the
richest
fields
in
all
the
black
hills
country
indeed
it
seemed
that
there
was
no
end
to
the
depth
of
sand
in
the
shaft
and
as
long
as
the
sand
held
out
the
gold
was
likely
to
when
just
in
the
flush
of
their
early
triumph
the
old
humpback
was
visited
by
another
somnambulistic
fit
and
this
time
he
discovered
gold
down
in
the
northern
mountain
side
and
prophesied
that
the
quartz
rock
which
could
be
mined
therefrom
would
more
than
repay
the
cost
and
trouble
of
opening
up
the
vein
and
of
transporting
machinery
to
the
gulch
we
need
not
go
into
detail
of
what
followed
suffice
it
to
say
that
immediate
arrangements
were
made
and
executed
toward
developing
this
as
yet
unknown
territory
while
redburn
set
to
work
with
two
ute
indians
transported
to
the
gulch
from
deadwood
under
oath
of
secrecy
by
the
general
to
blast
into
the
and
get
at
the
quartz
the
old
locater
in
person
set
out
for
cheyenne
on
the
secret
mission
of
procuring
a
portable
crusher
boiler
and
engine
and
such
other
implements
as
would
be
needed
and
getting
them
safely
into
the
gulch
unknown
to
the
roving
population
of
the
hills
country
and
most
wonderful
to
relate
he
succeeded
two
weeks
after
his
departure
he
returned
with
the
machinery
and
two
score
of
ute
indians
whom
he
had
sworn
into
his
service
for
as
a
ute
rarely
breaks
his
word
they
were
likely
to
prove
valuable
accessories
to
the
plans
of
our
two
friends
redburn
had
in
the
meantime
blasted
in
until
he
came
upon
the
quartz
rock
here
he
had
to
stop
until
the
arrival
of
the
machinery
he
however
busied
himself
in
enlarging
the
cabin
and
building
a
curb
to
the
shaft
which
occupied
his
time
until
at
last
the
general
and
his
army
returned
d
now
we
see
these
two
successful
men
standing
and
gazing
at
the
result
of
their
joint
labors
each
financially
happy
each
growing
rich
as
the
day
rolls
away
the
miners
are
in
a
prosperous
condition
and
everything
moves
off
with
that
ease
and
order
that
speaks
of
shrewd
management
and
constant
attention
to
business
the
gold
taken
from
the
shaft
is
much
finer
than
that
extracted
from
the
quartz
the
quartz
yielded
about
eighteen
dollars
to
the
ton
which
the
general
declared
to
be
as
well
as
a
feller
expect
considerin
things
more
or
less
therefore
it
will
be
seen
by
those
who
have
any
knowledge
whatever
of
gold
mining
that
after
paying
off
the
expenses
our
friends
were
not
doing
so
badly
after
all
yes
yes
the
general
was
remarking
as
he
gazed
at
the
string
of
mules
that
alternately
issued
from
and
the
fissure
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
yes
yes
boyee
things
ar
workin
as
i
like
ter
see
at

she
will

ar
cleer
fer

true
the
shaft
is
more
than
paying
off
the
hands
replied
redburn
seating
himself
upon
a
bowlder
and
staring
vacantly
at
the
dense
column
of
smoke
ejected
from
the
in
the
roof
of
the
crusher
building
i
was
looking
up
accounts
last
evening
and
after
deducting
what
you
paid
for
the
machinery
and
what
wages
are
due
the
utes
we
have
about
a
thousand
dollars
clear
of
all
to
be
divided
between
three
of
us
exactly
now
that
i
call
fair
to
middling

be
more
or

but
et
be

i
opine
right
again
unless
something
happens
more
than
we
think
for
now
if
we
get
through
another
month
however
without
being
nosed
out
why
we
may
consider
ourselves
lucky
jes
so
jes
so
but
we
hev

take
our

redburn
interrupted
suddenly
leaping
to
his
feet
they
say
the
devil
couriers
are
ever
around
when
you
are
talking
of
them
look
invaders
already
he
pointed
toward
the
east
where
the
passage
led
out
of
the
valley
into
the
gorge
beyond
out
of
this
passage
two
persons
on
horseback
had
just
issued
and
now
they
came
to
a
halt
evidently
surprised
at
the
scene
which
lay
spread
out
before
them
no
sooner
did
the
general
clap
his
eyes
on
the
pair
than
he
uttered
a
cry
of
astonishment
mingled
with
joy
it
thet
scarlet

redburn
frowned
he

to

for
a
certain
time
whether
he
wants

or
not
he
muttered
more
savage
than
usual
it
looked
to
him
as
if
this
was
to
be
the
signal
of
a
general
invasion
come
let
go
and
see
what
we
can
do
they
left
the
foothills
clambered
down
into
the
valley
and
worked
their
way
toward
where
fearless
frank
and
his
companion
sat
in
waiting
as
they
did
so
headed
by
a
figure
in
black
who
wore
a
mask
as
did
all
the
rest
a
band
of
horsemen
rode
out
of
the
fissure
into
the
valley
one
glance
and
we
recognize
deadwood
dick
prince
of
the
road
and
his
band
of
chapter
xii
making
terms
all
around
old
general
nix

the

to

ejaculated

all
redburn
uttered
an
ejaculation
as
he
saw
the
swarm
of
invaders
that
was
perhaps
more
forcible
than
polite
he
did
not
like
the
looks
of
things
at
all
if
ned
harris
were
only
here
he
thought
he
could
throw
the
responsibility
all
off
on
his
shoulders
but
he
was
not
neither
had
he
been
seen
or
heard
of
since
he
had
quitted
the
valley
over
a
month
ago
where
he
was
staying
all
this
time
was
a
problem
that
no
one
could
solve
no
one
among
our
three
friends
the
general
had
made
inquiries
in
deadwood
but
elicited
no
information
concerning
the
young
miner
he
had
dropped
entirely
out
of
the
magic
city
notice
and
might
be
dead
or
dying
in
some
foreign
clime
for
all
they
knew
anita
worried
and
grew
sadder
each
day
at
his
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
in
distress
or
worse
perhaps
dead
he
had
never
stayed
away
so
long
before
she
said
always
returning
from
his
trips
every
few
days
what
then
could
now
be
the
reason
of
his
prolonged
absence
redburn
foresaw
trouble
in
the
intrusion
of
the
and
fearless
frank
although
he
knew
not
the
character
or
calling
of
the
former
and
he
resolved
to
make
one
bold
stroke
in
defense
of
the
mines
go
to
the
quartz
mines
as
quickly
as
you
can
he
said
addressing
nix
and
call
every
man
to
his
arms
then
rally
them
out
here
where
i
will
be
waiting
with
the
remainder
of
our
forces
and
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
if
it
is
to
be
a
fight
for
our
rights
a
desperate
fight
it
shall
be
the
general
hurried
off
with
as
much
alacrity
as
was
possible
with
him
toward
the
quartz
mine
while
redburn
likewise
made
haste
to
visit
the
shaft
and
collect
together
his
handful
of
men
he
passed
the
cabin
on
the
way
and
seeing
anita
seated
in
the
doorway
he
came
to
a
momentary
halt
you
had
better
go
inside
and
lock
the
doors
and
windows
behind
you
he
said
advisingly
there
are
invaders
in
the
gulch
and
we
must
try
and
effect
a
settlement
with
them
so
it
is
not
desirable
that
they
should
see
you
you
are
not
going
to
fight
them
yes
if
they
will
not
come
to
reasonable
terms
which
i
shall
name
why
oh
do
fight
you
will
get
killed
humph
what
of
that
who
would
care
if
i
were
killed
i
would
for
one
mr
redburn
the
miner
heart
gave
a
great
bound
and
he
gazed
into
the
pure
white
face
of
the
girl
passionately
was
it
possible
that
she
had
in
her
heart
anything
akin
to
love
for
already
be
had
conceived
a
passing
fancy
for
her
which
might
ripen
into
love
in
time
thanks
he
said
catching
up
her
hand
and
pressing
it
to
his
lips
those
words
few
as
they
are
make
me
happy
miss
anita
but
stop
i
must
away
go
inside
and
keep
shady
until
you
see
me
again
and
so
saying
he
hurried
on
in
ten
minutes
time
two
score
of
brawny
utes
were
rallied
in
the
valley
and
redburn
was
at
their
head
accompanied
by
the
general
i
will
now
go
forward
and
hold
parley
said
harry
as
he
wrapped
a
kerchief
about
the
muzzle
of
his
if
you
see
me
fall
you
can
calculate
that
it
about
time
for
you
to
sling
in
a
chunk
of
your
lip
he
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
talking
in
an
illiterate
fashion
since
his
association
with
the
general
all
right
assented
the
old
locater
ef
they
try
ter
salt
ye
giv
a

at

rate

hours
a
mile
more
or
less
more
o
less

o
more
redburn
buckled
his
belt
a
hole
tighter
looked
to
his
two
revolvers
and
set
out
on
his
mission
the
had
in
the
mean
time
circled
off
to
the
right
of
the
fissure
and
formed
into
a
compact
body
where
they
halted
and
watched
the
rallying
of
the
savages
in
the
valley
fearless
frank
and
his
lovely
companion
remained
where
they
had
first
halted
awaiting
developments
they
had
stumbled
into
paradise
and
were
both
surprised
and
bewildered
redburn
approached
them
first
he
was
at
loss
how
to
open
the
confab
but
the
scarlet
boy
saved
him
the
trouble
i
presume
i
see
in
you
one
of
the
representatives
of
this
concern
he
said
doffing
his
hat
and
showing
his
pearly
teeth
in
a
little
smile
as
the
miner
came
up
you
do
replied
redburn
bowing
stiffly
i
am
an
owner
or
partner
in
this
mining
enterprise
which
until
your
sudden
advent
has
been
a
secret
to
the
outside
world
i
believe
you
pilgrim
for
though
i
am
pretty
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
topography
of
the
black
hills
country
i
had
not
the
least
idea
that
such
an
enterprise
existed
in
this
part
of
the
territory
no
i
dare
say
not
but
how
is
it
that
we
are
indebted
to
you
for
this
intrusion
for
such
we
feel
justified
in
calling
it
under
the
existing
circumstances
i
did
not
intend
to
intrude
sir
nor
do
i
now
in
riding
through
the
mountains
we
accidentally
stumbled
into
the
fissure
passage
that
leads
to
this
gulch
and
as
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
us
we
came
on
through
true
i
should
have
posted
a
strong
guard
in
the
pass
you
have
a
female
companion
i
perceive
not
your
wife
oh
no
nor
my
sister
either
this
is
miss
terry
an
estimable
young
lady
who
has
come
to
the
black
hills
in
search
of
her
father
your
name
is
redburn
harry
redburn
and
yours
i
am
told
is
fearless
frank
yes
that
is
the
title
i
sail
under
but
how
do
you
know
aught
of
me
i
was
told
your
name
by
a
partner
of
mine
now
then
concerning
the
present
matter
what
do
you
propose
to
do
to
do
why
turn
back
i
suppose
i
see
nothing
else
to
do
redburn
leaned
on
his
rifle
and
considered
do
you
belong
to
that
other
crowd
no
indeed
frank
face
flushed
half
angrily
i
thank
my
stars
i
am
not
quite
so
low
down
as
that
yet
do
you
know
them
deadwood
dick
the
prince
of
the
road
and
his
band
of
outlaws
what
is
it
possible
the
same
gang
whom
the
is
making
such
a
splurge
over
every
week
the
same
that
fellow
clad
in
black
is
deadwood
dick
the
leader
humph
he
in
black
you
in
scarlet
two
contrasting
colors
that
is
so
i
had
not
thought
of
it
before
but
no
significance
is
attached
thereto
perhaps
not
have
you
the
least
idea
what
brought
them
here
the
i
reckon
i
do
the
military
has
been
chasing
them
for
the
last
two
days
probably
they
have
come
here
for
protection
maybe
so
or
for
plunder
give
me
your
decision
and
i
will
go
and
see
what
they
want
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
decide
more
than
to
take
the
back
track
redburn
shook
his
head
decidedly
you
can
not
go
back
he
said
using
positiveness
in
his
argument
that
is
not
for
awhile
you
have
all
deadwood
down
on
us
in
a
jiffy
i
give
you
work
in
the
shaft
at
three
dollars
a
day
you
can
accept
that
offer
or
submit
to
confinement
until
i
see
fit
to
set
you
at
liberty
and
my
companion
here
i
will
place
under
the
charge
of
miss
anita
for
the
present
where
she
will
receive
hospitable
treatment
fearless
frank
started
as
though
he
had
been
struck
a
violent
blow
his
face
grew
very
white
his
eyes
dilated
he
trembled
in
every
joint
he
gasped
i
believe
that
is
what
i
said
redburn
could
not
understand
the
youth
agitation
he
knew
that
the
sister
of
ned
harris
had
a
secret
was
this
fearless
frank
in
any
way
connected
with
it
and
if
so
how
do
you
know
her
her
other
name
is
harris
anita
harris
in
full
do
you
know
her
or
aught
of
her
i
i
i
did
once
was
the
slow
reply
where
is
she
i
want
to
see
her
redburn
took
a
moment
to
consider
would
it
be
best
to
permit
a
meeting
between
the
two
until
he
should
be
able
to
learn
something
more
definite
concerning
the
secret
if
ned
harris
were
here
would
he
sanction
such
a
meeting
no
something
told
the
young
miner
that
he
would
not
something
warned
him
that
it
could
result
in
no
good
to
allow
the
scarlet
youth
an
interview
with
sad
anita
you
can
not
see
her
he
at
last
said
decidedly
there
is
a
reason
why
you
two
should
never
meet
again
and
if
you
remain
in
the
gulch
as
you
will
be
obliged
to
for
the
present
you
must
give
me
your
word
of
honor
that
you
will
not
go
near
yonder
cabin
fearless
frank
had
expected
this
therefore
he
was
not
surprised
neither
did
redburn
know
how
close
he
had
shied
his
stone
at
the
real
truth
i
promise
mckenzie
said
after
a
moment
deliberation
on
my
honor
that
i
will
not
approach
the
cabin
providing
you
will
furnish
me
my
meals
and
lodgings
elsewhere
if
anita
comes
to
me
what
then
i
will
see
that
she
does
not
redburn
answered
positively
gradually
he
was
assuming
full
control
of
things
in
the
absence
of
harris
himself
miss
terry
you
may
ride
down
to
yonder
cabin
and
tell
anita
i
sent
you
pilgrim
you
can
come
along
with
me
no
i
will
accompany
alice
as
far
as
where
your
forces
are
stationed
said
frank
and
then
they
rode
down
the
slope
redburn
turning
toward
where
the
sat
upon
their
horses
in
a
compact
body
with
deadwood
dick
at
their
head
as
the
miner
drew
nigh
and
came
to
a
standstill
the
prince
of
the
road
rode
forward
to
his
side
well
he
said
interrogatively
his
voice
heavy
yet
pleasant
i
suppose
you
desire
to
know
what
bizness
we
got
in
your
cornfield
eh
stranger
that
about
the
dimensions
of
it
yes
replied
redburn
at
once
conceiving
a
liking
for
the
young
in
whom
he
thought
he
saw
a
true
gentleman
in
the
disguise
of
a
devil
i
came
over
to
learn
the
object
you
have
in
view
in
invading
our
little
valley
if
you
have
no
objections
in
telling
certainly
not
as
you
may
have
guessed
already
we
are
a
band
of
whose
field
of
action
we
have
lately
confined
to
the
black
hills
country
i
have
the
honor
of
being
the
leader
and
you
have
doubtless
heard
of
me
deadwood
dick
the
prince
as
the
persists
in
terming
me
just
at
present
things
are
rather
sultry
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
deadwood
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
and
we
sought
this
locality
to
escape
a
small
army
of
the
deadwood
military
who
have
been
nosing
around
after
us
for
the
past
week
well
well
we
happened
to
see
a
man
and
woman
come
this
way
and
believing
that
it
must
lead
to
somewhere
or
other
we
followed
and
here
we
are
out
of
the
reach
of
the
but
i
take
it
the
way
of
a
party
of
secret
miners
is
it
not
so
no
not
necessarily
so
unless
you
put
yourselves
in
the
way
you
wish
to
remain
quartered
here
for
the
present
if
not
contrary
to
your
wishes
we
should
like
to
yes
i
have
no
objections
to
offer
providing
you
will
agree
to
two
points
and
what
are
they
may
i
ask
these
that
you
will
camp
at
the
mouth
of
the
passage
and
thus
keep
out
any
other
intruders
that
may
come
second
that
you
will
keep
your
men
to
this
side
or
the
valley
and
not
interfere
with
any
of
our
laborers
to
which
i
eagerly
agree
you
shall
experience
no
inconvenience
from
our
presence
here
you
furnish
us
a
haven
of
safety
from
the
pursuing
soldiers
we
in
return
will
extend
you
our
aid
in
repelling
a
host
of
who
may
any
moment
come
down
this
way
in
swarms
very
well
that
settles
it
then
you
keep
your
promise
and
all
will
go
well
the
two
shook
hands
then
redburn
turned
and
strode
back
to
dismiss
his
forces
while
dick
and
his
men
took
up
their
position
at
the
place
where
the
fissure
opened
into
the
gulch
here
they
made
preparations
to
camp
redburn
while
returning
to
his
men
heard
a
shout
of
joy
and
looking
up
saw
to
his
surprise
that
the
old
general
and
alice
terry
were
locked
in
each
other
arms
in
a
loving
embrace

what
did
it

had
the

gone

he
purposely
insulting
the
beautiful

fearless

stood
aside
apparently

did
likewise
at

miss
terry
made
no
serious
attempts
to
free
herself
from
the
general
embrace
a
few

brought
redburn
to
the
spot
panting
breathless
perspiring
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
disgraceful
scene
he
demanded
angrily
disgraceful
the
old
general
set
miss

down
on
her
feet
after
giving
her
a
resounding
smack
and
turned
to
stare
at
the

i
formally
present
you
to
miss
alice
terry
darter
redburn
colored
and
was
not
a
little
disconcerted
on
account
of
his
blunder
but
he
rallied
in
a
moment
and
acknowledged
the
introduction
with
becoming
grace
and
dignity
you
must
excuse
my
interference
he
said
earnestly
i
saw
the
old
here
taking
liberties
that
no
stranger
should
take
and
knowing
nothing
of
the
relationship
existing
between
you
i
was
naturally
inclined
to
think
that
he
was
either
drunk
or
crazy
therefore
i
deemed
it
necessary
to
investigate
no
offense
i
hope
of
course
not
and
alice
smiled
one
of
her
sweetest
smiles
you
did
perfectly
right
and
are
deserving
of
no
censure
whatever
after
a
few
moments
of
desultory
conversation
redburn
took
the
general
to
one
side
and
spoke
on
the
subject
of
fearless
frank
and
anita
harris
of
his
action
in
the
matter
and
so
forth
nix
or
terry
as
the
latter
was
evidently
his
real
name
heartily
coincided
with
his
views
and
both
agreed
that
it
was
best
not
to
let
the
scarlet
boy
come
within
range
of
anita
or
at
least
not
till
ned
harris
should
return
when
he
could
do
as
he
chose
accordingly
it
was
decided
that
fearless
frank
should
be
set
to
work
in
the
quartz
mine
that
being
the
furthest
from
the
cabin
and
he
could
eat
and
sleep
either
in
the
mine
or
in
the
crusher
building
whichever
he
liked
best
after
settling
this
point
the
two
men
rejoined
the
others
and
frank
was
apprised
of
their
decision
he
made
no
remarks
upon
it
but
it
was
plain
to
see
that
he
was
anything
but
satisfied
his
wild
spirit
yearned
for
constant
freedom
the
utes
were
dismissed
and
sent
back
to
their
work
the
general
strolled
off
with
mckenzie
toward
the
quartz
mine
it
devolved
upon
redburn
to
escort
alice
to
the
cabin
which
he
did
with
pleasure
and
gave
her
an
introduction
to
sweet
anita
who
awaited
their
coming
in
the
open
doorway
the
two
girls
greeted
each
other
with
warmth
it
was
apparent
that
they
would
become
fast
friends
when
they
learned
more
of
each
other
as
for
redburn
he
was
secretly
enamored
with
the
general
pretty
daughter
she
was
beautiful
and
evidently
accomplished
and
her
progenitor
was
financially
what
then
was
lacking
to
make
her
a
fitting
mate
for
any
man
redburn
pondered
deeply
on
this
subject
as
he
left
the
girls
together
and
went
out
to
see
to
his
duties
in
the
mines
he
found
terry
and
fearless
frank
in
the
quartz
mine
looking
at
the
miners
examining
new
projected
slopes
suggesting
easier
methods
for
working
out
different
lumps
of
rock
while
the
former
knowledge
of
practical
mining
was
extended
the
latter
was
limited
i
think
thet
thar
ar
bigger
prospects
yet
in
further
the
old
locater
was
saying
i
ai
much
varsed
on
jeeological
toppygraffical
formation
myself
ye
see
but
then
it
kinder
to
me
thet
this
quartz
vein
ar
to
hold
out
fer
a
time
yet
doubtless
more
straight
digging
an
less
slopes
i
should
think
would
be
practicable
mckenzie
observed
i
do
see
it
said
redburn
joining
them
sloping
and
transversing
discovers
new
veins
while
line
work
soon
plays
out
i
think
things
are
working
in
excellent
order
at
present
they
all
made
a
tour
of
the
mine
which
had
been
dug
a
considerable
distance
into
the
mountain
the
quartz
was
ordinarily
productive
and
being
rather
loosely
thrown
together
was
blasted
down
without
any
extra
trouble
after
a
short
consultation
redburn
and
the
general
concluded
to
place
frank
over
the
utes
as
superintendent
and
as
they
saw
that
he
was
not
used
to
digging
blasting
or
any
of
the
rough
work
connected
with
the
mine
although
he
was
and
inventive
when
tendered
the
position
it
was
gratefully
accepted
by
him
he
expressing
it
his
intention
to
work
for
the
interest
of
his
employers
as
long
as
he
should
stay
in
the
gulch
night
at
last
fell
over
the
flower
pocket
and
work
ceased
the
utes
procured
their
own
food
mainly
consisting
of
fish
from
the
little
creek
and
deer
and
mountain
birds
that
could
be
brought
down
at
almost
any
hour
from
the
neighboring
crags
and
slept
in
the
open
air
redburn
had
mckenzie
a
comfortable
bed
made
in
the
and
sent
him
out
a
meal
fit
for
a
prince
as
yet
anita
knew
nothing
of
the
scarlet
youth
identity
scarcely
knew
in
fact
that
he
was
in
the
valley
at
the
cabin
the
evening
meal
was
dispatched
with
a
general
expression
of
cheerfulness
about
the
board
anita
seemed
less
downcast
than
usual
and
the
vivacious
alice
made
life
and
merriment
for
all
she
was
witty
where
wit
was
proper
and
sensible
in
an
unusual
degree
redburn
was
infatuated
with
her
he
watched
her
with
an
expression
of
fondness
in
his
eyes
he
admired
her
every
gesture
and
action
he
saw
something
new
to
admire
in
her
each
moment
he
was
in
her
society
when
the
evening
meal
was
cleared
away
he
took
down
the
guitar
and
sung
several
ballads
the
old
general
accompanying
him
with
his
rich
deep
bass
and
alice
with
her
clear
birdlike
alto
and
the
sweet
melody
of
the
trio
voices
called
forth
round
after
round
of
rapturous
applause
from
the
camped
upon
the
slope
and
from
the
utes
who
were
lounging
here
and
there
among
the
of
the
valley
but
of
the
lot
deadwood
dick
was
the
only
one
bold
enough
to
approach
the
cabin
he
came
sauntering
along
and
halted
on
the
threshold
nodding
to
the
occupants
of
the
little
apartment
with
a
nonchalance
which
was
not
assumed
he
said
tipping
his
sombrero
but
taking
care
not
to
let
the
mask
slip
from
his
face
i
hope
mine
is
not
an
intrusion
hearing
music
i
was
loth
to
stay
away
for
i
am
a
great
lover
of
music
it
is
the
one
passion
that
appeals
to
my
better
nature
he
seated
himself
on
the
little
stone
step
and
motioned
for
redburn
to
proceed
one
of
those
inside
the
cabin
had
been
strangely
affected
at
the
sight
of
dick
and
that
person
was
anita
she
turned
deathly
pale
her
eyes
assumed
an
expression
of
affright
and
she
trembled
violently
as
she
first
saw
him
the
prince
of
the
road
however
if
he
saw
her
noticed
not
her
agitation
in
fact
he
took
not
the
second
glance
at
her
while
he
remained
at
the
cabin
his
eyes
were
almost
constantly
fastening
upon
the
lovely
face
and
form
of
alice
thinking
it
best
to
humor
one
who
might
become
either
a
powerful
enemy
or
an
influential
friend
redburn
accordingly
struck
up
a
lively
air
la
and
in
exact
imitation
of
a
minstrel
rendered
gwine
to
get
a
home
bymeby
and
the
thunders
of
that
came
from
the
outside
listeners
showed
how
surely
he
had
touched
upon
a
pleasant
chord
he
followed
that
with
several
modern
songs
all
of
which
were
received
well
and
heartily
applauded
that
recalls
memories
of
good
old
times
said
the
as
he
leaned
back
against
the
and
gazed
at
the
mountains
grand
majestic
stupendous
and
the
starlit
sky
azure
calm
and
serene
recalls
the
days
of
early
boyhood
that
were
gay
pure
and
happy
ah
ho
he
heaved
a
deep
sign
and
his
head
dropped
upon
his
breast
a
deathlike
silence
pervaded
the
cabin
that
one
heartfelt
sigh
aroused
a
sensation
of
pity
in
each
of
the
four
hearts
that
beat
within
the
cabin
walls
that
the
was
a
gentleman
in
disguise
was
not
to
be
gainsayed
all
felt
that
despite
his
outlawed
calling
he
was
deserving
of
a
place
among
them
in
his
better
moods
as
if
to
accord
with
his
mood
alice
began
a
sweet
birdlike
song
full
of
tender
pathos
and
of
quieting
sympathy
it
was
a
quaint
scottish
melody
rich
in
its
honeyed
meaning
sweetly
weird
and
pitiful
wonderfully
soothing
and
nourishing
to
a
weeping
spirit
clear
and
the
maiden
cultured
voice
swelled
out
on
the
still
night
air
and
the
mountain
echoes
caught
up
the
strains
and
lent
a
wild
peculiar
accompaniment
deadwood
dick
listened
with
his
head
still
bowed
and
his
hands
clasped
about
one
knee
listened
in
a
kind
of
fascination
until
the
last
reverberations
of
the
song
had
died
out
in
a
wailing
echo
then
he
sprung
abruptly
to
his
feet
drew
one
hand
wearily
across
the
masked
brow
raised
his
sombrero
with
a
deft
movement
and
bowed
himself
out
out
into
the
night
where
the
moon
and
stars
looked
down
at
him
perhaps
with
more
lenience
than
on
some
alice
terry
rose
from
her
seat
crossed
over
to
the
door
and
gazed
after
the
straight
handsome
form
until
it
had
mingled
with
the
other
who
had
camped
upon
the
slope
then
she
turned
about
and
sat
down
on
the
couch
beside
anita
you
are
still
dear
she
said
stroking
the
other
long
unconfined
hair
are
you
lonely
if
not
why
do
you
say
something
i
have
nothing
to
say
replied
anita
a
sad
sweet
smile
playing
over
her
features
i
have
been
too
much
taken
up
with
the
music
to
think
of
talking
but
you
are
seldom
talkative
so
brother
used
to
tell
me
he
said
i
had
lost
my
heart
and
tongue
redburn
was
drumming
on
the
with
his
fingers
a
sort
of
lonely
tattoo
it
was
you
seemed
to
be
much
interested
in
the
outlaw
miss
terry
he
observed
as
if
by
chance
the
thought
had
just
occurred
to
him
when
in
reality
he
was
downright
jealous
had
you
two
ever
met
certainly
not
sir
and
alice
flashed
him
an
inquiring
glance
why
do
you
ask
oh
for
no
reason
in
particular
only
i
fancied
that
song
was
meant
especially
for
him
redburn
afterward
would
have
given
a
hundred
dollars
to
have
recalled
those
words
for
the
haughty
look
alice
gave
him
instantly
showed
him
he
was
on
the
wrong
track
if
he
wished
to
court
her
favor
it
must
be
in
a
different
way
and
he
must
not
again
give
her
a
glimpse
of
his
jealous
nature
you
spoke
of
a
brother
said
alice
turning
to
anita
does
he
live
here
with
you
yes
when
not
away
on
business
he
has
now
been
absent
for
over
a
month
indeed
is
he
as
sweet
sad
and
silent
as
yourself
oh
no
ned
is
unlike
me
he
is
buoyant
cheerful
pleasant
ned
what
is
his
full
name
dear
edward
harris
alice
grew
suddenly
pale
and
speechless
as
she
remembered
the
handsome
young
miner
whom
fearless
frank
had
slain
in
the
duel
just
outside
of
deadwood
this
then
was
his
sister
and
evidently
she
as
yet
knew
nothing
of
his
sad
fate
do
you
know
aught
concerning
edward
harris
redburn
asked
seeing
her
agitation
alice
considered
a
moment
i
do
she
answered
at
last
this
fearless
frank
whom
i
came
here
with
had
a
duel
with
a
man
just
above
deadwood
whose
name
was
edward
harris
my
god
and
his
fate
he
was
instantly
killed
and
left
lying
where
he
dropped
there
was
a
scream
of
agony
just
here
and
a
heavy
fall
anita
had
fainted
chapter
xiv
the
transient
triumph
redburn
sprung
from
his
seat
ran
over
to
her
side
and
raised
her
tenderly
in
his
arms
poor
thing
he
murmured
gazing
into
her
pale
still
face
the
shock
was
too
much
for
her
no
wonder
she
fainted
he
laid
her
on
the
couch
and
kept
off
the
others
who
crowded
around
bring
cold
water
he
ordered
and
i
will
soon
have
her
out
of
this
fit
alice
hastened
to
obey
and
anita
face
and
hands
were
bathed
in
the
cooling
liquid
until
she
began
to
show
signs
of
returning
consciousness
you
may
now
give
me
the
particulars
of
the
affair
redburn
said
rising
and
closing
the
door
for
a
chilly
breeze
was
sweeping
into
the
cabin
alice
proceeded
to
comply
with
his
request
by
narrating
what
had
occurred
and
as
nearly
as
possible
what
had
been
said
when
she
had
concluded
he
gazed
down
for
several
moments
thoughtfully
into
the
face
of
anita
there
was
much
yet
that
was
beyond
his
powers
of
comprehension
a
knotty
problem
for
which
he
saw
no
immediate
solution
what
do
you
think
about
it
general
he
asked
turning
to
the
have
we
sufficient
evidence
to
hang
this
devil
in
scarlet
hardly
boyee
hardly
te
me
to
ther
gal

a
fair
shake

these
parts
more
o

less
more
et
ai
ter
yank
a
critter
up
by
ther
throat
i
know
it
is
not
according
to
the
customs
of
this
country
of
the
black
hills
but
look
at
it
that
fellow
who
i
am
satisfied
is
a
knave
has
not
only
taken
the
life
of
poor
harris
but
very
probably
has
given
his
sister
her
the
question
is
should
he
go
unpunished
in
the
face
of
all
this
evidence
yes
let
him
go
will
be
the
one
to
punish
him
it
was
anita
who
spoke
she
had
partly
arisen
on
the
couch
her
face
was
streaked
with
water
and
slightly
haggard
her
hair
blew
unconfined
about
her
neck
and
shoulders
her
eyes
blazed
with
a
wild
almost
savage
fire
let
him
go
she
repeated
more
of
fierceness
in
her
voice
than
redburn
had
ever
heard
there
before
he
shall
not
escape
my
vengeance
oh
my
poor
poor
dead
brother
she
flung
herself
back
upon
the
couch
and
gave
herself
up
to
a
wild
passionate
uncontrollable
outburst
of
tears
and
sobs
the
wailings
of
a
sorrowing
heart
for
a
long
time
she
continued
to
weep
and
sob
violently
then
came
a
lull
during
which
she
fell
asleep
from
exhaustion
a
deep
sleep
redburn
and
alice
then
carried
her
into
an
adjoining
room
where
she
was
left
under
the
latter
skillful
care
awhile
later
the
cabin
was
wrapped
in
silence
when
morning
sunlight
next
peeped
down
into
the
flower
pocket
it
found
everything
generally
astir
anita
was
up
and
pursuing
her
household
duties
but
she
was
calm
now
even
sadder
than
before
making
a
strange
contrast
to
blithe
gaysome
alice
who
flitted
about
here
and
there
like
some
butterfly
surrounded
by
a
halo
of
perpetual
sunshine
unknown
to
any
one
save
themselves
two
men
were
within
the
valley
of
the
flower
pocket
there
on
business
and
that
business
meant
bloodshed
they
were
secreted
in
among
the
foothills
on
the
western
side
of
the
flowering
paradise
at
a
point
where
they
were
not
observed
and
at
the
same
time
were
the
observers
of
all
that
was
going
on
in
front
of
them
how
came
they
here
when
the
hand
of
deadwood
dick
guarded
the
only
accessible
entrance
there
was
to
the
valley
the
answer
was
they
came
secretly
through
the
pass
on
the
night
preceding
the
arrival
of
the
and
had
been
lying
in
close
concealment
ever
since
the
one
was
an
elderly
man
of
portly
figure
and
the
other
a
young
dandyish
fellow
evidently
the
elder
son
for
they
resembled
each
other
in
every
feature
we
make
no
difficulty
to
recognizing
them
as
the
same
precious
pair
whom
outlaw
dick
captured
from
the
stage
only
to
lose
them
again
through
the
treachery
of
two
of
his
own
band
both
looked
considerably
the
worse
for
wear
and
the
gaunt
hungry
expression
on
their
features
as
the
morning
sunlight
shone
down
upon
them
declared
in
a
language
more
adequate
than
words
that
they
were
beginning
to
suffer
the
first
pangs
of
starvation
we
can
not
hold
out
at
this
rate
much
longer
the
elder
filmore
cried
as
he
watched
the
bustle
in
the
valley
below
i
as
empty
as
a
collapsed
balloon
and
what
more
we
in
no
prospects
of
immediate
relief
filmore
the
younger
groaned
aloud
in
agony
of
spirit
curse
the
black
hills
and
all
who
have
been
fools
enough
to
inhabit
them
anyhow
he
growled
savagely
just
let
me
get
back
in
the
land
of
civilization
again
and
you
can
bet
your
bottom
dollar
i
know
enough
to
stay
there
bah
this
little
rough
experience
will
do
you
good
if
we
only
had
a
square
meal
or
two
and
a
basket
of
sherry
i
should
feel
quite
at
home
nothing
but
a
fair
prospect
of
increasing
our
individual
finances
would
ever
have
lured
me
into
this
outlandish
place
but
money
you
know
is
the
root
of
all
evil
broke
in
the
other
and
after
three
months
you
are
just
as
destitute
of
the
desired
root
as
you
were
at
first
true
but
we
have
at
least
discovered
one
of
the
shrubs
at
the
bottom
of
which
grows
the
root
you
refer
to
deadwood
dick
i
do
he
is
here
in
the
valley
and
he
must
never
leave
it
alive
while
we
have
the
chance
we
must
strike
the
blow
that
will
forever
silence
his
tongue
yes
but
what
about
the
girl
she
will
be
just
as
much
in
the
way
if
not
a
good
deal
more
so
we
can
manage
her
all
right
when
the
proper
time
arrives
dick
is
our
game
now
he
may
prove
altogether
too
much
game
but
now
that
we
are
counting
eggs
how
much
of
the
is
to
be
mine
when
this
boy
and
girl
are
finished
he
queried
how
much
well
that
depends
upon
circumstances
the
girl
fall
to
you
the
girl
bah
i
rather
be
excused
the
day
passed
without
incident
in
the
mines
the
work
went
steadily
on
the
sounds
of
the
crusher
making
strange
music
for
the
mountain
echoes
to
mock
occasionally
the
crack
of
a
rifle
announced
that
either
a
or
a
ute
miner
had
risked
a
shot
at
a
mountain
sheep
bird
or
deer
generally
their
aim
was
attended
with
success
though
sometimes
they
were
unable
to
procure
the
slaughtered
game
redburn
on
account
of
his
and
business
tact
had
full
charge
of
both
mines
the
general
working
under
him
in
the
shaft
and
fearless
frank
in
the
quartz
mine
when
questioned
about
his
duel
with
harris
by
redburn
mckenzie
had
very
little
to
say
he
seemed
pained
when
approached
on
the
subject
would
answer
no
questions
concerning
the
past
was
reserved
and
at
times
singularly
haughty
during
the
day
anita
and
alice
took
a
stroll
through
the
valley
but
the
latter
had
been
warned
and
fought
shy
of
the
quartz
mine
so
there
was
no
encounter
between
anita
and
fearless
frank
deadwood
dick
joined
them
as
they
were
returning
to
the
cabin
loaded
down
with
flowers
flowers
of
almost
every
color
and
perfume
this
is
a
beautiful
day
he
remarked
pulling
up
a
daisy
as
he
walked
gracefully
along
one
rarely
sees
so
many
beauties
centered
in
one
little
valley
like
this
beautiful
landscape
and
mountain
scenery
beautiful
flowers
beneath
smiling
skies
and
lovely
women
the
chief
center
of
attraction
among
all
indeed
and
alice
gave
him
a
coquettish
smile
you
are
flattering
sir
you
at
least
are
not
beautiful
in
that
horrible
black
suit
and
villainous
mask
you
remind
me
of
a
picture
i
have
seen
somewhere
of
the
devil
in
disguise
all
that
is
lacking
is
the
horns
tail
and
dick
broke
out
into
a
burst
of
laughter
it
was
one
of
those
wild
terrible
laughs
of
his
so
peculiar
to
hear
from
one
who
was
evidently
young
in
years
both
of
the
girls
were
terrified
and
would
have
fled
had
he
not
detained
them
ha
ha
he
said
stepping
in
front
of
them
do
not
be
frightened
do
go
ladies
that
only
the
way
i
express
my
amusement
at
anything
then
for
mercy
sake
do
get
amused
again
said
alice
deprecatingly
why
dear
me
i
thought
the
old
nick
and
all
his
couriers
had
pounced
down
upon
us
well
how
do
you
know
but
what
he
has
may
be
his
satanic
majesty
or
one
of
his
envoys
i
hardly
think
so
you
are
too
much
an
earthly
being
for
that
come
now
take
off
that
detestable
mask
and
let
me
see
what
you
look
like
no
indeed
i
would
not
remove
this
mask
except
on
conditions
for
all
the
gold
yon
toiling
miners
are
finding
which
i
am
satisfied
is
no
small
amount
you
spoke
of
conditions
what
are
they
some
time
perhaps
i
will
tell
you
lady
but
not
now
see
my
men
are
signaling
to
me
and
i
must
go
adieu
ladies
and
in
another
moment
he
had
wheeled
and
was
striding
back
toward
camp
in
their
concealment
the
two
filmores
witnessed
this
meeting
between
dick
and
the
two
girls
so
there
are
females
here
eh
grunted
the
elder
musingly
from
observation
i
should
say
that
prince
dick
was
a
comparative
stranger
here
that
is
my
opinion
groaned
clarence
his
thoughts
reverting
to
his
empty
stomach
did
you
hear
that
laugh
a
moment
ago
it
was
more
like
the
screech
of
a
lunatic
than
anything
else
yes
he
is
a
young
tiger
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
to
my
mind
and
we
shall
have
to
keep
on
the
alert
to
take
him
he
came
to
the
cabin
last
night
if
he
does
we
can
mount
him
before
night
the
elder
filmore
succeeded
in
capturing
a
wild
goose
that
had
strayed
down
with
the
stream
from
somewhere
above
this
was
killed
dressed
and
half
cooked
by
a
brushwood
fire
which
they
hazarded
in
a
fissure
in
the
hillside
whereto
they
had
hidden
this
fowl
they
almost
ravenously
devoured
and
thus
thoroughly
satisfied
their
appetites
they
now
felt
a
great
deal
better
ready
for
the
work
in
hand
of
capturing
and
slaying
the
deadwood
dick
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
they
crept
like
the
prowling
wolves
they
were
down
into
the
valley
and
positioned
themselves
midway
between
the
cabin
and
the
camp
but
several
yards
apart
with
a
lasso
held
above
the
grass
between
them
to
serve
as
a
the
sky
had
become
overcast
with
dense
black
clouds
and
the
gloom
to
the
valley
was
quite
impenetrable
from
their
concealment
the
two
filmores
could
hear
redburn
alice
and
the
general
singing
up
at
the
cabin
and
it
told
them
to
be
on
their
guard
as
dick
might
now
come
along
at
any
moment
slowly
the
minutes
dragged
by
and
both
were
growing
impatient
when
the
firm
tread
of
the
prince
was
heard
swiftly
approaching
quickly
the
lasso
was
drawn
taut
dick
not
dreaming
of
the
trap
came
boldly
along
tripped
and
went
sprawling
to
the
ground
the
next
instant
his
enemies
were
on
him
each
with
a
long
murderous
knife
in
hand
chapter
xv
to
the
rescue
the
suddenness
of
the
onslaught
prevented
deadwood
dick
from
raising
a
hand
to
defend
himself
and
the
two
strong
men
piling
their
combined
weights
upon
him
had
the
effect
to
render
him
utterly
helpless
he
would
have
yelled
to
apprise
his
comrades
of
his
fate
but
alexander
filmore
ready
for
the
emergency
quickly
thrust
a
cob
of
wood
into
his
mouth
and
bound
it
there
with
strong
strings
the
young
was
a
prisoner
hal
ha
leered
the
elder
filmore
peering
down
into
the
masked
face
ha
ha
my
young
eaglet
so
i
have
you
at
last
have
i
after
repeated
efforts
to
get
you
in
my
power
i
have
at
last
been
rewarded
with
success
eh
ha
ha
the
terrible
scourge
of
the
black
hills
lies
here
at
my
feet
mine
to
do
with
as
i
shall
see
fit
shall
we
settle
him
and
leave
him
lying
here
where
his
gang
can
find
him
interrupted
the
younger
filmore
who
now
that
his
blood
was
up
cared
little
what
he
did
you
give
him
one
jab
and
i
will
guarantee
to
finish
him
with
the
second
no
no
boy
you
are
too
hasty
before
we
silence
him
forever
we
must
ascertain
if
possible
where
the
girl
is
but
he
never
tell
us
we
have
that
yet
to
find
out
it
is
my
opinion
that
we
can
bring
him
to
terms
somehow
take
hold
and
we
will
carry
him
back
to
our
hole
in
the
hill
deadwood
dick
was
accordingly
seized
by
the
neck
and
heels
and
borne
swiftly
and
silently
toward
the
western
side
of
the
gulch
up
among
the
foothills
into
the
rift
where
the
plotters
had
lain
concealed
since
their
arrival
here
he
was
placed
upon
the
ground
in
a
sitting
posture
and
his
two
enemies
crouched
on
either
side
of
him
like
beasts
ready
to
spring
upon
their
prey
below
in
the
valley
the
utes
had
kindled
one
solitary
fire
and
this
with
a
starlike
gleam
of
light
from
the
cabin
window
was
the
only
sign
of
life
to
be
seen
through
the
night
black
shroud
the
trio
in
the
foothills
were
evidently
quite
alone
alexander
filmore
broke
the
silence
well
my
gay
deadwood
dick
prince
of
the
road
i
suppose
you
wish
to
have
the
matter
over
with
as
soon
as
possible
the
nodded
better
let
him
loose
in
the
jaws
suggested
filmore
the
younger
or
how
else
shall
we
get
from
him
what
we
must
know
take
out
his
gag
i
hold
my
six
against
his
pulsometer
if
he
squawks
i
silence
him
sure
as
there
is
virtue
in
powder
and
ball
the
elder
after
some
deliberation
acquiesced
and
dick
was
placed
in
possession
of
his
speaking
power
while
the
muzzle
of
young
revolver
pressed
against
his
breast
warned
him
to
silence
and
obedience
now
said
the
elder
filmore
just
you
keep
mum
if
you
try
any
trickery
it
will
only
hasten
your
destruction
which
is
inevitable
deadwood
dick
gave
a
little
laugh
you
talk
as
if
you
were
going
to
do
something
toward
making
me
the
center
of
funeralistic
attraction
you
find
out
soon
enough
young
man
i
have
not
pursued
you
so
long
all
for
nothing
you
may
rest
assured
your
death
will
be
the
only
event
that
can
atone
for
all
the
trouble
you
have
given
me
in
the
past
that
so
well
you
seem
to
hold
all
the
cards
and
i
reckon
you
ought
to
win

i
ca
see
into
your
inordinate
thirst
for
when
will
eventually
triumph
had
i
a
of
i
am
not
so
sure
but
what
i
could
you
though
you
are
i
think
not
when
kings

the
game
is
virtually
up
we
hold
altogether
to
high
cards
for
you
at
present
and
as
you
may
we
shall
not
you
do
be
too
sure
of
it
the
best
trout
often
slips
from
the
hook
when
you
are
sanguine
that
you
have
at
last
been
immoderately
successful
but
enough
of
this
cheap
talk
go
on
and
say
your
say
in
as
few
words
as
possible
for
i
am
in
a
hurry
both
filmore
and
filmore
laughed
at
this
it
sounded
so
ridiculously
funny
to
hear
a
helpless
prisoner
talk
of
being
in
a
hurry
business
must
be
pressing
leered
the
elder
savagely
do
be
at
all
scared
we
start
you
humming
along
the
road
to
jordan
soon
enough
if
that
what
you
want
first
however
we
desire
you
to
inform
us
where
we
can
find
the
girl
as
we
wish
to
make
a
clean
sweep
while
we
are
about
it
do
you
bathe
your
face
in
abruptly
asked
the
staring
at
his
captor
quizzically
do
you
bathe
in
certainly
not
sir
why
do
you
ask
because
the
hardness
of
you
cheek
is
highly
suggestive
of
the
use
of
some
similar
application
alexander
filmore
stared
at
his
son
a
moment
at
loss
to
comprehend
but
as
it
began
to
dawn
upon
him
that
he
was
the
butt
of
a
hard
hit
he
uttered
a
frightful
curse
my
cheek
and
your
character
bear
a
close
resemblance
then
he
retorted
hotly
again
i
ask
you
will
you
tell
me
where
the
girl
is
no
you
must
take
me
for
an
ornery
mule
or
some
other
kind
of
an
animal
if
you
think
i
would
deliver
her
into
clutches
no
no
my
scheming
knaves
i
will
not
kill
me
if
you
like
but
it
will
not
accomplish
your
villainous
ends
she
has
all
of
the
papers
and
can
not
only
put
herself
forward
at
the
right
time
but
can
have
you
arrested
for
my
murder
bah
we
can
find
her
as
we
have
found
you
so
we
will
not
trifle
clarence
get
ready
and
when
i
count
one
two
three
pull
the
trigger
and
i
finish
him
with
my
knife
all
right
go
ahead
i
ready
replied
the
dutiful
son
fearless
frank
sat
upon
a
bowlder
in
the
mouth
of
the
quartz
mine
listening
to
the
strains
of
music
that
floated
up
to
him
from
the
cabin
out
in
the
valley
and
puffing
moodily
away
at
a
grimy
old
pipe
he
had
purchased
together
with
some
tobacco
from
one
of
the
utes
with
whom
he
worked
he
had
not
gone
down
to
the
for
his
supper
he
did
not
feel
hungry
and
was
more
contented
here
in
the
mouth
of
the
mine
where
he
could
command
a
view
of
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
valley
with
his
pipe
for
a
companion
he
was
as
happy
as
he
could
be
deprived
as
he
was
from
association
with
the
others
of
his
color
who
had
barred
him
out
in
the
cold
once
or
twice
during
the
day
on
coming
from
within
to
get
a
breath
of
pure
air
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
anita
as
she
flitted
about
the
cabin
engaged
at
her
household
duties
and
the
yearning
expression
that
unconsciously
stole
into
his
dark
eyes
spoke
of
a
passion
within
his
heart
that
though
it
might
be
slumbering
was
not
extinct
was
there
all
the
same
in
all
its
strength
and
ardor
had
he
been
granted
the
privilege
of
meeting
her
he
might
have
displaced
the
barrier
that
rose
between
them
but
now
nothing
remained
for
him
but
to
toil
away
until
redburn
should
see
fit
to
send
him
away
back
into
the
world
from
which
he
came
would
he
want
to
go
when
that
time
came
hardly
he
thought
as
he
sat
there
and
gazed
into
the
quiet
vale
below
him
so
beautiful
even
in
darkness
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
go
back
again
adrift
upon
the
bustling
world
he
had
no
relatives
no
claims
that
pointed
him
to
go
thither
he
was
as
free
and
unfettered
as
the
wildest
mountain
eagle
he
had
no
one
to
say
where
he
should
and
where
he
should
not
go
he
liked
one
place
equally
as
well
as
another
providing
there
was
plenty
of
provender
and
work
within
easy
range
he
had
never
thought
of
settling
down
until
now
when
he
had
come
to
the
flower
pocket
valley
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
anita
anita
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
years
on
whom
he
had
brought
censure
reproach
and
a
step
among
the
rocks
close
at
hand
startled
him
from
a
reverie
into
which
he
had
fallen
and
caused
him
to
spill
the
tobacco
from
his
pipe
a
slight
trim
figure
stood
a
few
yards
away
and
he
perceived
that
two
extended
hands
clasped
objects
whose
glistening
surface
suggested
that
they
were
sixes
or
sevens
silence
came
in
a
clear
authoritative
voice
one
word
more
than
i
ask
you
and
i
blow
your
brains
out
now
what
your
name
justin
mckenzie
my
name
fearless
frank
generally
answers
me
the
purpose
of
a
nom
de
plume
was
the
reply
very
good
and
the
stranger
drew
near
enough
for
the
scarlet
boy
to
perceive
that
he
was
clad
in
well
armed
wore
a
spanish
sombrero
and
hair
long
down
over
the
square
shoulders
i
calamity
jane
if
mckenzie
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
surprise
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
he
had
heard
many
stories
in
deadwood
concerning
the
gal
dressed
up
in
men
toggery
calamity
jane
he
echoed
picking
up
his
pipe
where
in
the
world
did
come
from
and
how
did
you
get
here
and
what
do
you
want
and
one
at
a
time
please
i
came
from
deadwood
with
party
unknown
to
them
understand
you
that
answers
two
questions
the
third
is
i
want
to
be
around
when
there
any
fun
going
on
and
it
lucky
i
here
now
i
guess
dick
has
just
got
layed
out
by
two
fellows
in
the
valley
below
here
and
they
slid
off
with
him
over
among
the
yonder
i
want
you
to
stub
along
after
me
and
lend
the
voices
of
your
sixes
if
need
be
i
going
to
set
him
at
liberty
i
at
your
service

quickly
replied
excitement
was
one
of
his
passions
adventure
was
another
are
you
well
heeled
i
reckon
always
make
it
a
point
to
be
prepared
for
wild
beasts
and
the
like
you
know
a
good
idea
well
if
you
are
ready
we
slide
i
do
want
them
toughs
to
get
the
drop
on
dick
if
i
can
help
it
who
are
they
who
the
toughs
yes
they
that
took
the
i
do
know
guess
they
some
former
enemies
of
his
without
doubt
they
propose
to
quiz
a
secret
about
some
girl
out
of
him
and
then
knife
him
we
have
to
hurry
or
they
get
their
work
in
ahead
of
us
they
left
the
mouth
of
the
mine
and
skurried
down
into
the
valley
through
the
dense
shroud
of
gloom
calamity
jane
led
the
way
she
was
both
fleet
of
foot
and
cautious
let
us
look
down
on
the
camp
and
the
two
fillmores
who
are
stationed
on
either
side
of
their
prisoner
the
younger
presses
the
muzzle
of
his
revolver
against

the
elder
holds
a
long
gleaming
knife
upheld
in
his
right
hand
one
he
counts
savagely
two
after
a
momentary
pause
another
lapse
of
time
and
then
hold
gentlemen
that
will
do
cries
a
clear
ringing
voice
and
calamity
jane
and
mckenzie
stepping
out
of
the
darkness
with
four
gleaming
sixes
in
hand
confirm
the
pleasant
assertion
chapter

the
mercy
conclusion
nevertheless
the
gleaming
blade
of
alexander
filmore
descended
and
was
buried
in
the
fleshy
part
of
deadwood
dick
neck
making
a
wound
painful
but
not
necessarily
dangerous
you
vile
varmint
cried
calamity
jane
pulling
the
hammer
of
one
of
her
revolvers
back
to
full
cock
you
cursed
fool
do
you
know
that
that
only
seals
yer
own
miserable
fate
she
took
deliberate
aim
but
dick
interrupted
her
do
shoot
jennie
he
gasped
the
blood
spurting
from
his
wound
this
ai
none
o
your
funeral
give
three
shrill
whistles
for
my
men
and
they
take
care
o
these
hounds
until
i
able
to
attend
to
take
me
to
the
cab
he
could
not
finish
the
sentence
a
sickening
stream
of
blood
gushed
from
his
mouth
and
he
fell
back
upon
the
ground
insensible
fearless
frank
gave
the
three
shrill
whistles
while
calamity
jane
covered
the
two
cowering
wretches
with
her
revolvers
the
distress
signal
was
answered
by
a
yell
and
in
a
few
seconds
five
came
bounding
up
seize
these
two
cusses
and
guard
well
calamity
said
grimly
they
are
a
precious
pair
and
in
a
few
days
no
doubt
you
have
the
pleasure
of
attending
their
funerals
your
captain
is
wounded
but
not
dangerously
i
hope
we
will
take
him
to
the
cabin
where
there
are
light
and
skillful
hands
to
dress
his
wounds
when
he
wants
you
we
will
let
you
know
be
sure
and
guard
these
knaves
well
now
the
men
growled
an
assent
and
after
binding
the
captives
arms
hustled
them
off
toward
camp
in
double
quick
time
muttering
threats
of
vengeance
fearless
frank
and
calamity
then
carefully
raised
the
stricken
and
bore
him
to
the
cabin
where
he
was
laid
upon
the
couch
of
course
all
was
now
excitement
redburn
and
alice
set
to
work
to
dress
the
bleeding
wound
with
jane
and
the
general
looking
on
to
see
that
nothing
was
left
undone
fearless
frank
stood
apart
from
the
rest
his
arms
folded
across
his
breast
a
grave
expression
upon
his
handsome
features
anita
was
not
in
the
room
at
the
time
but
she
came
in
a
moment
later
and
stood
gazing
about
her
in
wondering
surprise
then
her
eyes
rested
upon
fearless
frank
for
the
first
and
she
grew
deathly
white
she
trembled
in
every
limb
a
look
came
into
her
eyes
the
young
man
in
scarlet
was
similarly
effected
his
cheeks
blanched
his
lips
became
firmly
compressed
a
mastering
expression
fell
from
his
dark
magnetic
orbs
there
they
stood
face
to
face
a
picture
of
doubt
of
indifferent
respect
of
opposite
strong
passions
subdued
to
control
by
a
heavy
hand
none
of
the
others
noticed
them
they
were
alone
confronting
each
other
trying
to
read
the
other
thoughts
the
one
penitent
and
craving
forgiveness
the
other
cold
almost
to
sternness
and
yet
not
unwilling
to
forgive
and
forget
deadwood
dick
wound
was
quickly
and
skillfully
dressed
it
was
not
dangerous
but
was
so
exceedingly
painful
that
the
pangs
soon
brought
him
back
to
consciousness
the
moment
he
opened
his
eyes
he
saw
fearless
frank
and
anita
perceived
their
position
toward
each
other
and
that
it
would
require
only
a
single
word
to
bridge
the
chasm
between
them
a
hard
look
came
into
his
eyes
as
they
gazed
through
the
holes
in
the
mask
then
he
gazed
at
alice
sweet
piquant
alice
and
the
hardness
melted
like
snow
before
the
spring
sunshine
thank
god
it
was
no
deeper
he
said
sitting
upright
and
rubbing
the
tips
of
his
fingers
over
the
patches
that
covered
the
gash
although
deucedly
bothersome
it
is
not
of
much
account
to
the
surprise
of
all
he
sprung
to
his
feet
and
strode
to
the
door
here
he
stopped
and
looked
around
for
a
few
moments
sniffing
at
the
cool
mountain
breeze
as
a
dog
would
a
single
cedar
tree
stood
by
the
cabin
its
branches
bare
and
naked
stretching
out
like
huge
arms
above
the
doorway
and
it
was
at
these
the
gazed
a
savage
gleam
in
his
piercing
black
eyes
after
a
few
careful
observations
he
turned
his
face
within
the
cabin
justin
mckenzie
he
said
gazing
at
the
young
man
steadily
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
service
go
to
my
camp
and
say
to
my
men
that
i
desire
their
presence
here
together
with
the
two
prisoners
and
a
couple
of
stout
lariats
with
nooses
at
the
end
of
them
hurry
now
fearless
frank
started
a
trifle
for
he
seemed
to
recognize
the
voice
but
the
next
instant
he
bowed
assent
and
left
the
cabin
when
he
was
gone
dick
turned
to
redburn
have
you
a
glass
of
water
handy
cap
this
jab
in
the
gullet
makes
me
somewhat
thirsty
he
said
redburn
nodded
and
procured
the
drink
then
a
strange
silence
pervaded
the
cabin
a
silence
that
no
one
seemed
willing
to
break
at
last
the
tramp
of
many
feet
was
heard
and
a
moment
later
the
with
fearless
frank
at
their
head
reached
the
doorway
where
they
halted
the
moment
deadwood
dick
came
forward
there
was
a
wild
deafening
cheer
hurra
hurra
deadwood
dick
prince
of
the
road
still
lives
three
long
hearty
cheers
lads
and
a
hummer
cried
fearless
frank
and
then
the
mountain
echoes
reverberated
with
a
thousand
discordant
yells
of
hurrah
the
young
responded
with
a
nod
and
then
said
the
prisoners
have
you
them
there
here
they
are
cap
cried
a
score
of
voices
and
the
two
filmores
were
trotted
out
to
the
front
with
ropes
already
about
their
necks
shall
we
not
jest
yet
boys
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
first
then
turning
in
the
doorway
deadwood
dick
continued
ladies
and
gentlemen
a
little
tragedy
is
about
to
take
place
here
soon
and
it
becomes
necessary
that
i
should
say
a
few
words
explaining
what
cause
i
have
for
hanging
these
two
wretches
whom
you
see
here
therefore
i
will
tell
you
a
short
story
and
you
will
see
that
my
cause
is
just
as
we
look
at
these
things
here
in
this
delectable
country
of
the
black
hills
to
begin
with
my
name
is
to
you
harris
and
here
the
flung
aside
the
black
mask
revealing
the
smiling
face
of
the
young
i
have
another
my
family
name
but
i
do
not
use
it
preferring
harris
to
it
anita
yonder
is
my
sister
several
years
ago
when
we
were
children
living
in
one
of
the
eastern
states
we
were
made
orphans
by
the
death
of
our
parents
who
were
drowned
while
driving
upon
a
frozen
lake
in
company
with
my
uncle
alexander
filmore
and
his
son
clarence
those
are
the
parties
yonder
and
as
god
is
my
judge
i
believe
they
are
answerable
for
the
death
of
our
father
and
mother
alexander
filmore
was
appointed
guardian
over
us
and
executor
of
our
property
which
amounted
to
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
my
father
having
been
for
years
extensively
engaged
in
speculation
at
which
he
was
most
always
successful
from
the
day
of
their
death
we
began
to
receive
the
most
tyrannical
treatment
we
were
whipped
kicked
about
and
kept
in
a
condition
twice
when
we
were
in
bed
and
as
he
supposed
asleep
alexander
filmore
came
to
us
and
attempted
to
assassinate
us
but
my
watchfulness
was
a
match
for
his
villainy
and
we
escaped
death
at
his
hands
finding
that
this
kind
of
life
was
unbearable
i
appealed
to
our
neighbors
and
even
to
the
courts
for
protection
but
my
enemy
was
a
man
of
great
influence
and
after
many
vain
attempts
i
found
that
i
could
not
obtain
a
hearing
that
nothing
remained
for
me
to
do
but
to
fight
my
own
way
and
i
did
fight
it
out
of
my
father
safe
i
purloined
a
sum
of
money
sufficient
to
defray
our
expenses
for
a
while
and
then
taking
anita
with
me
i
fled
from
the
home
of
my
youth
i
came
first
to
fort
laramie
where
i
spent
a
year
in
the
service
of
a
my
guardian
during
that
year
sent
three
men
out
to
kill
me
but
they
had
the
tables
turned
on
them
and
their
bones
lay
bleaching
even
now
on
laramie
plains
during
that
year
my
sister
met
a
gay
dashing
young
ranger
who
hailed
to
the
name
of
justin
mckenzie
and
of
course
she
fell
in
love
with
him
that
was
natural
as
he
was
handsome
suave
and
gallant
and
more
than
all
reported
tolerably
well
i
made
inquiries
and
found
that
there
was
nothing
against
his
moral
character
so
i
made
no
objections
to
his
paying
his
attentions
to
anita
but
one
day
a
great
surprise
came
on
returning
from
a
of
several
days
duration
i
found
my
home
deserted
and
a
letter
from
anita
stating
that
she
had
gone
with
mckenzie
to
cheyenne
to
live
they
were
not
married
yet
but
would
be
soon
that
aroused
the
hellish
part
of
my
passionate
nature
i
believed
that
mckenzie
was
leading
her
a
life
of
dishonor
and
it
made
my
blood
boil
to
even
think
of
it
death
i
swore
should
be
his
reward
for
this
infidelity
and
mounting
my
horse
i
set
out
in
hot
haste
for
cheyenne
but
i
arrived
there
too
late
to
accomplish
my
mission
of
vengeance
i
found
anita
and
took
her
back
to
my
home
a
sad
and
sorrowing
maiden
mckenzie
i
could
not
find
he
had
heard
of
my
coming
and
fled
to
escape
my
avenging
hand
but
over
the
head
of
my
weeping
sister
i
swore
a
fearful
oath
of
vengeance
and
i
have
it
yet
to
keep
i
believe
there
had
been
some
kind
of
a
sham
marriage
anita
would
never
speak
on
the
subject
so
i
had
to
guess
at
the
terrible
truth
and
there
where
you
made
an
accursed
mess
of
the
whole
affair
cried
mckenzie
stepping
into
the
cabin
and
leading
anita
forward
by
the
hand
and
man
acknowledge
anita
harris
to
be
my
legally
wedded
listen
edward
harris
and
i
will
explain
that
day
that
you
came
to
cheyenne
in
pursuit
of
me
i
acknowledge
i
committed
an
error
one
that
has
caused
me
much
trouble
since
the
case
was
this
i
was
the
nearest
of
kin
to
a
rich
old
who
proposed
to
leave
me
all
his
property
at
his
death
but
he
was
a
desperate
and
bound
me
to
a
promise
that
i
would
never
marry
tempted
by
the
lust
for
gold
i
yielded
and
he
drew
up
a
will
in
my
favor
this
was
before
i
met
anita
here
when
we
went
to
cheyenne
the
old
man
was
lying
at
the
point
of
death
so
i
told
anita
that
we
would
not
be
married
for
a
few
days
until
we
saw
how
matters
were
going
to
shape
if
he
died
we
would
be
married
secretly
and
she
would
return
to
your
roof
until
i
could
get
possession
of
my
inheritance
when
we
would
go
to
some
other
part
of
the
country
to
live
if
he
recovered
i
would
marry
her
anyway
and
let
the
old
man
go
to
tophet
with
his
i
see
now
how
i
was
in
the
wrong
well
that
very
day
before
your
arrival
the
old
man
himself
pounced
down
upon
us
and
cursed
me
up
hill
and
down
for
my
treachery
and
forthwith
struck
me
out
from
his
will
i
immediately
sent
for
a
chaplain
and
was
married
to
anita
i
then
went
up
to
see
the
old
man
and
find
if
i
could
not
effect
a
compromise
with
him
he
told
me
if
i
would
go
with
him
before
anita
and
swear
that
she
was
not
legally
my
wife
and
that
i
would
never
live
with
her
he
would
again
alter
his
will
in
my
favor
knowing
that
that
would
make
no
difference
so
far
as
the
law
was
concerned
i
sent
anita
a
note
apprising
her
of
what
was
coming
and
stating
that
she
had
best
return
to
you
until
the
old
man
should
die
when
i
would
come
for
her
subsequently
i
went
before
her
in
company
with
the
old
man
and
swore
as
i
had
promised
to
do
and
when
i
departed
she
was
weeping
bitterly
but
i
naturally
supposed
it
was
sham
grief
a
month
later
on
his
the
old
trader
showed
me
the
letter
i
had
sent
her
and
i
realized
that
not
only
was
my
little
game
up
but
that
i
had
cheated
myself
out
of
a
love
that
was
true
i
was
left
entirely
out
of
the
will
and
ever
since
i
have
bitterly
cursed
the
day
that
tempted
me
to
try
to
win
gold
and
love
at
the
same
time
here
edward
harris
and
the
young
man
drew
a
packet
of
papers
from
inside
his
pocket
are
two
certificates
of
my
marriage
one
for
anita
and
one
for
myself
you
see
now
that
although
mine
has
been
a
grievous
error
no
dishonor
is
coupled
with
your
sister
name
ned
harris
took
one
of
the
documents
and
glanced
over
it
the
expression
on
his
face
softening
a
moment
later
he
turned
and
grasped
mckenzie
hand
god
bless
you
old
boy
he
said
huskily
i
am
the
one
who
has
erred
and
if
you
have
it
in
your
heart
to
forgive
me
try
and
do
so
i
do
not
expect
much
quarter
in
this
world
you
know
there
is
anita
take
her
if
she
will
come
to
you
and
may
god
shower
his
eternal
blessings
upon
you
both
mckenzie
turned
around
with
open
arms
and
anita
flew
to
his
embrace
with
a
low
glad
cry
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
room
there
was
an
impatient
surging
of
the
crowd
outside
dick
saw
that
his
men
were
longing
for
the
sport
ahead
so
he
resumed
his
story
there
is
not
much
more
to
add
he
said
after
a
moment
thought
i
fled
into
the
black
hills
when
the
first
whispers
of
gold
got
afloat
and
chancing
upon
this
valley
i
built
us
a
home
here
wherein
to
live
away
the
rest
of
our
lives
in
time
i
organized
the
band
of
men
you
see
around
me
and
took
to
the
road
of
this
my
sister
knew
nothing
the
hills
have
been
my
haunt
ever
since
and
during
all
this
time
yon
scheming
knaves
pointing
to
the
prisoners
have
been
constantly
sending
out
men
to
murder
me
the
last
tool
hugh
vansevere
by
name
boldly
posted
up
reward
papers
in
the
most
frequented
routes
and
he
went
the
same
way
as
his
predecessors
seeing
that
nothing
could
be
accomplished
through
aids
my
enemies
have
at
last
come
out
to
superintend
my
butchery
in
person
and
but
for
the
timely
interference
of
calamity
jane
and
justin
mckenzie
a
short
time
since
i
should
have
ere
this
been
numbered
with
the
dead
now
i
am
inclined
to
be
merciful
to
only
those
who
have
been
merciful
to
me
therefore
i
have
decided
that
alexander
and
clarence
filmore
shall
pay
the
penalty
of
hanging
for
their
attempted
crimes
boys
up
so
saying
deadwood
dick
stepped
without
the
cabin
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
redburn
also
shut
down
and
curtained
the
windows
to
keep
out
the
horrible
sight
and
sounds
but
for
all
this
those
inside
could
not
help
but
hear
the
pleading
cries
of
the
doomed
wretches
the
tramp
of
heavy
feet
the
hushed
babble
of
voices
and
at
last
the
terrible
shout
of
heave
up
they
go
which
signaled
the
commencement
of
the
victims
journey
into
then
there
was
a
long
blank
pause
not
a
sound
was
heard
not
a
voice
spoke
nor
a
foot
moved
this
silence
was
speedily
broken
however
by
two
heavy
falls
followed
almost
immediately
by
the
tramp
of
feet
not
till
all
was
again
quiet
did
redburn
venture
to
open
the
door
and
look
out
all
was
dark
and
still
the
had
gone
and
left
no
sign
of
their
work
behind
when
morning
dawned
they
were
seen
to
have
on
the
eastern
slope
where
the
smoke
of
their
rose
in
graceful
white
columns
through
the
clear
transparent
atmosphere
during
the
day
dick
met
alice
terry
as
she
was
gathering
flowers
a
short
distance
from
the
cabin
alice
miss
terry
he
said
gravely
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
i
love
you
and
want
you
for
my
own
darling
be
mine
alice
and
i
will
mend
my
ways
and
settle
down
to
an
honest
straightforward
life
the
beautiful
girl
looked
up
pityingly
no
she
said
shaking
her
head
her
tone
kind
and
respectful
i
can
not
love
you
and
never
can
be
your
wife
mr
harris
you
love
another
he
interrogated
she
did
not
answer
but
the
blush
that
suffused
her
cheek
did
for
her
it
is
redburn
he
said
positively
very
well
give
him
my
congratulations
see
alice
here
the
young
took
the
crape
mask
from
his
bosom
i
now
resume
the
wearing
of
this
mask
your
refusal
has
decided
my
future
a
merry
i
have
been
and
a
merry
i
shall
die
now
forever
on
the
following
morning
it
was
discovered
that
the
and
their
daring
leader
together
with
the
no
less
heroic
calamity
jane
had
left
the
valley
gone
whither
no
one
knew
about
a
month
later
one
day
when
calamity
jane
was
watering
her
horse
at
the
stream
two
miles
above
deadwood
the
chief
rode
out
of
the
chaparral
and
joined
her
he
was
still
masked
well
armed
and
looking
every
inch
a
prince
of
the
road
jennie
he
said
reining
in
his
steed
i
am
lonely
and
want
a
companion
to
keep
me
company
through
life
you
have
no
one
but
yourself
our
spirits
and
general
temperament
agree
will
you
marry
me
and
become
my
queen
no
said
the
girl
haughtily
sternly
i
have
had
all
the
i
care
for
we
can
be
friends
dick
more
we
can
never
be
very
well
jennie
i
it
is
destined
that
i
shall
live
single
at
any
rate
i
never
take
a
refusal
from
another
woman
yes
gal
we
be
friends
if
nothing
more
there
is
little
more
to
add
we
might
write
at
length
but
choose
a
few
words
to
end
this
true
romance
of
life
in
the
black
hills
mckenzie
and
anita
were
remarried
in
deadwood
and
at
the
same
time
redburn
led
alice
terry
to
the
altar
which
consummation
the
general
avowed
was
more
or
less
of
a
good
thing
less
o
more
more
o
less
through
eastern
lawyers
a
settlement
of
the
harris
affairs
was
effected
the
whole
of
the
property
being
turned
over
to
anita
thereby
placing
her
and
fearless
frank
above
want
for
a
lifetime
therefore
they
gave
up
their
interest
in
the
flower
pocket
mines
to
redburn
and
the
general
calamity
jane
is
still
in
the
hills
and
grim
and
uncommunicative
there
roams
through
the
country
of
gold
a
youth
in
black
at
the
head
of
a
bold
lawless
gang
