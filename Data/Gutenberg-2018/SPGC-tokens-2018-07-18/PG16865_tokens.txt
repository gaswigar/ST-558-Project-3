the
piece
of
wood
that
laughed
and
cried
like
a
child
there
was
once
upon
a
time
a
piece
of
wood
in
the
shop
of
an
old
carpenter
named
master
antonio
everybody
however
called
him
master
cherry
on
account
of
the
end
of
his
nose
which
was
always
as
red
and
polished
as
a
ripe
cherry
no
sooner
had
master
cherry
set
eyes
on
the
piece
of
wood
than
his
face
beamed
with
delight
and
rubbing
his
hands
together
with
satisfaction
he
said
softly
to
himself
this
wood
has
come
at
the
right
moment
it
will
just
do
to
make
the
leg
of
a
little
table
he
immediately
took
a
sharp
axe
with
which
to
remove
the
bark
and
the
rough
surface
but
just
as
he
was
going
to
give
the
first
stroke
he
heard
a
very
small
voice
say
imploringly
do
not
strike
me
so
hard
he
turned
his
terrified
eyes
all
around
the
room
to
try
and
discover
where
the
little
voice
could
possibly
have
come
from
but
he
saw
nobody
he
looked
under
the
bench
nobody
he
looked
into
a
cupboard
that
was
always
shut
nobody
he
looked
into
a
basket
of
shavings
and
sawdust
nobody
he
even
opened
the
door
of
the
shop
and
gave
a
glance
into
the
street
and
still
nobody
who
then
could
it
be
i
see
how
it
is
he
said
laughing
and
scratching
his
wig
evidently
that
little
voice
was
all
my
imagination
let
us
set
to
work
again
and
taking
up
the
axe
he
struck
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
piece
of
wood
oh
oh
you
have
hurt
me
cried
the
same
little
voice
dolefully
this
time
master
cherry
was
petrified
his
eyes
started
out
of
his
head
with
fright
his
mouth
remained
open
and
his
tongue
hung
out
almost
to
the
end
of
his
chin
like
a
mask
on
a
fountain
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
the
use
of
his
speech
he
began
to
say
stuttering
and
trembling
with
fear
but
where
on
earth
can
that
little
voice
have
come
from
that
said
oh
is
it
possible
that
this
piece
of
wood
can
have
learned
to
cry
and
to
lament
like
a
child
i
can
not
believe
it
this
piece
of
wood
is
nothing
but
a
log
for
fuel
like
all
the
others
and
thrown
on
the
fire
it
would
about
suffice
to
boil
a
saucepan
of
beans
how
then
can
anyone
be
hidden
inside
it
if
anyone
is
hidden
inside
so
much
the
worse
for
him
i
will
settle
him
at
once
so
saying
he
seized
the
poor
piece
of
wood
and
commenced
beating
it
without
mercy
against
the
walls
of
the
room
then
he
stopped
to
listen
if
he
could
hear
any
little
voice
lamenting
he
waited
two
minutes
nothing
five
minutes
nothing
ten
minutes
still
nothing
i
see
how
it
is
he
then
said
forcing
himself
to
laugh
and
pushing
up
his
wig
evidently
the
little
voice
that
said
oh
was
all
my
imagination
let
us
set
to
work
again
putting
the
axe
aside
he
took
his
plane
to
plane
and
polish
the
bit
of
wood
but
whilst
he
was
running
it
up
and
down
he
heard
the
same
little
voice
say
laughing
stop
you
are
tickling
me
all
over
this
time
poor
master
cherry
fell
down
as
if
he
had
been
struck
by
lightning
when
he
at
last
opened
his
eyes
he
found
himself
seated
on
the
floor
his
face
was
changed
even
the
end
of
his
nose
instead
of
being
crimson
as
it
was
nearly
always
had
become
blue
from
fright

master
cherry
gives
the
wood
away
at
that
moment
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
come
in
said
the
carpenter
without
having
the
strength
to
rise
to
his
feet
a
lively
little
old
man
immediately
walked
into
the
shop
his
name
was
geppetto
but
when
the
boys
of
the
neighborhood
wished
to
make
him
angry
they
called
him
pudding
because
his
yellow
wig
greatly
resembled
a
pudding
made
of
indian
corn
geppetto
was
very
fiery
woe
to
him
who
called
him
pudding
he
became
furious
and
there
was
no
holding
him
master
antonio
said
geppetto
what
are
you
doing
there
on
the
floor
i
am
teaching
the
alphabet
to
the
ants
much
good
may
that
do
you
what
has
brought
you
to
me
neighbor
geppetto
my
legs
but
to
tell
the
truth
master
antonio
i
came
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
here
i
am
ready
to
serve
you
replied
the
carpenter
getting
on
his
knees
this
morning
an
idea
came
into
my
head
let
us
hear
it
i
thought
i
would
make
a
beautiful
wooden
puppet
one
that
could
dance
fence
and
leap
like
an
acrobat
with
this
puppet
i
would
travel
about
the
world
to
earn
a
piece
of
bread
and
a
glass
of
wine
what
do
you
think
of
it
bravo
pudding
exclaimed
the
same
little
voice
and
it
was
impossible
to
say
where
it
came
from
hearing
himself
called
pudding
geppetto
became
as
red
as
a
from
rage
and
turning
to
the
carpenter
he
said
in
a
fury
why
do
you
insult
me
who
insults
you
you
called
me
pudding
it
was
not
i
do
you
think
i
called
myself
pudding
it
was
you
i
say
no
yes
no
yes
and
becoming
more
and
more
angry
from
words
they
came
to
blows
and
flying
at
each
other
they
bit
and
fought
and
scratched
when
the
fight
was
over
master
antonio
was
in
possession
of
yellow
wig
and
geppetto
discovered
that
the
grey
wig
belonging
to
the
carpenter
remained
between
his
teeth
give
me
back
my
wig
screamed
master
antonio
and
you
return
me
mine
and
let
us
be
friends
again
the
two
old
men
having
each
recovered
his
own
wig
shook
hands
and
swore
that
they
would
remain
friends
to
the
end
of
their
lives
well
then
neighbor
geppetto
said
the
carpenter
to
prove
that
peace
was
made
what
is
the
favor
that
you
wish
of
me
i
want
a
little
wood
to
make
my
puppet
will
you
give
me
some
master
antonio
was
delighted
and
he
immediately
went
to
the
bench
and
fetched
the
piece
of
wood
that
had
caused
him
so
much
fear
but
just
as
he
was
going
to
give
it
to
his
friend
the
piece
of
wood
gave
a
shake
and
wriggling
violently
out
of
his
hands
struck
with
all
of
its
force
against
the
shins
of
poor
geppetto
ah
is
that
the
courteous
way
in
which
you
make
your
presents
master
antonio
you
have
almost
lamed
me
i
swear
to
you
that
it
was
not
i
then
you
would
have
it
that
it
was
i
the
wood
is
entirely
to
blame
i
know
that
it
was
the
wood
but
it
was
you
that
hit
my
legs
with
it
i
did
not
hit
you
with
it
liar
geppetto
do
insult
me
or
i
will
call
you
pudding

pudding
baboon
pudding
on
hearing
himself
called
pudding
for
the
third
time
geppetto
mad
with
rage
fell
upon
the
carpenter
and
they
fought
desperately
when
the
battle
was
over
master
antonio
had
two
more
scratches
on
his
nose
and
his
adversary
had
lost
two
buttons
off
his
waistcoat
their
accounts
being
thus
squared
they
shook
hands
and
swore
to
remain
good
friends
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
geppetto
carried
off
his
fine
piece
of
wood
and
thanking
master
antonio
returned
limping
to
his
house

geppetto
names
his
puppet
pinocchio
geppetto
lived
in
a
small
room
that
was
only
lighted
from
the
staircase
the
furniture
could
not
have
been
simpler
a
rickety
chair
a
poor
bed
and
a
table
at
the
end
of
the
room
there
was
a
fireplace
with
a
lighted
fire
but
the
fire
was
painted
and
by
the
fire
was
a
painted
saucepan
that
was
boiling
cheerfully
and
sending
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
that
looked
exactly
like
real
smoke
as
soon
as
he
reached
home
geppetto
took
his
tools
and
set
to
work
to
cut
out
and
model
his
puppet
illustration
a
little
chicken
popped
out
very
gay
and
polite
what
name
shall
i
give
him
he
said
to
himself
i
think
i
will
call
him
pinocchio
it
is
a
name
that
will
bring
him
luck
i
once
knew
a
whole
family
so
called
there
was
pinocchio
the
father
pinocchia
the
mother
and
pinocchi
the
children
and
all
of
them
did
well
the
richest
of
them
was
a
beggar
having
found
a
name
for
his
puppet
he
began
to
work
in
good
earnest
and
he
first
made
his
hair
then
his
forehead
and
then
his
eyes
the
eyes
being
finished
imagine
his
astonishment
when
he
perceived
that
they
moved
and
looked
fixedly
at
him
geppetto
seeing
himself
stared
at
by
those
two
wooden
eyes
said
in
an
angry
voice
wicked
wooden
eyes
why
do
you
look
at
me
no
one
answered
he
then
proceeded
to
carve
the
nose
but
no
sooner
had
he
made
it
than
it
began
to
grow
and
it
grew
and
grew
and
grew
until
in
a
few
minutes
it
had
become
an
immense
nose
that
seemed
as
if
it
would
never
end
poor
geppetto
tired
himself
out
with
cutting
it
off
but
the
more
he
cut
and
shortened
it
the
longer
did
that
impertinent
nose
become
the
mouth
was
not
even
completed
when
it
began
to
laugh
and
deride
him
stop
laughing
said
geppetto
provoked
but
he
might
as
well
have
spoken
to
the
wall
stop
laughing
i
say
he
roared
in
a
threatening
tone
the
mouth
then
ceased
laughing
but
put
out
its
tongue
as
far
as
it
would
go
geppetto
not
to
spoil
his
handiwork
pretended
not
to
see
and
continued
his
labors
after
the
mouth
he
fashioned
the
chin
then
the
throat
then
the
shoulders
the
stomach
the
arms
and
the
hands
the
hands
were
scarcely
finished
when
geppetto
felt
his
wig
snatched
from
his
head
he
turned
round
and
what
did
he
see
he
saw
his
yellow
wig
in
the
puppet
hand
pinocchio
give
me
back
my
wig
instantly
but
pinocchio
instead
of
returning
it
put
it
on
his
own
head
and
was
in
consequence
nearly
smothered
geppetto
at
this
insolent
and
derisive
behavior
felt
sadder
and
more
melancholy
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
before
and
turning
to
pinocchio
he
said
to
him
you
young
rascal
you
are
not
yet
completed
and
you
are
already
beginning
to
show
want
of
respect
to
your
father
that
is
bad
my
boy
very
bad
and
he
dried
a
tear
the
legs
and
the
feet
remained
to
be
done
when
geppetto
had
finished
the
feet
he
received
a
kick
on
the
point
of
his
nose
i
deserve
it
he
said
to
himself
i
should
have
thought
of
it
sooner
now
it
is
too
late
he
then
took
the
puppet
under
the
arms
and
placed
him
on
the
floor
to
teach
him
to
walk
pinocchio
legs
were
stiff
and
he
could
not
move
but
geppetto
led
him
by
the
hand
and
showed
him
how
to
put
one
foot
before
the
other
when
his
legs
became
limber
pinocchio
began
to
walk
by
himself
and
to
run
about
the
room
until
having
gone
out
of
the
house
door
he
jumped
into
the
street
and
escaped
poor
geppetto
rushed
after
him
but
was
not
able
to
overtake
him
for
that
rascal
pinocchio
leaped
in
front
of
him
like
a
hare
and
knocking
his
wooden
feet
together
against
the
pavement
made
as
much
clatter
as
twenty
pairs
of
peasants
clogs
stop
him
stop
him
shouted
geppetto
but
the
people
in
the
street
seeing
a
wooden
puppet
running
like
a
stood
still
in
astonishment
to
look
at
it
and
laughed
and
laughed
at
last
as
good
luck
would
have
it
a
soldier
arrived
who
hearing
the
uproar
imagined
that
a
colt
had
escaped
from
his
master
planting
himself
courageously
with
his
legs
apart
in
the
middle
of
the
road
he
waited
with
the
determined
purpose
of
stopping
him
and
thus
preventing
the
chance
of
worse
disasters
when
pinocchio
still
at
some
distance
saw
the
soldier
barricading
the
whole
street
he
endeavored
to
take
him
by
surprise
and
to
pass
between
his
legs
but
he
failed
entirely
the
soldier
without
disturbing
himself
in
the
least
caught
him
cleverly
by
the
nose
and
gave
him
to
geppetto
wishing
to
punish
him
geppetto
intended
to
pull
his
ears
at
once
but
imagine
his
feelings
when
he
could
not
succeed
in
finding
them
and
do
you
know
the
reason
in
his
hurry
to
model
him
he
had
forgotten
to
make
any
ears
he
then
took
him
by
the
collar
and
as
he
was
leading
him
away
he
said
to
him
shaking
his
head
threateningly
we
will
go
home
at
once
and
as
soon
as
we
arrive
we
will
settle
our
accounts
never
doubt
it
at
this
information
pinocchio
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
would
not
take
another
step
in
the
meanwhile
a
crowd
of
idlers
and
inquisitive
people
began
to
assemble
and
to
make
a
ring
around
them
some
of
them
said
one
thing
some
another
poor
puppet
said
several
he
is
right
not
to
wish
to
return
home
who
knows
how
geppetto
that
bad
old
man
will
beat
him
and
the
others
added
maliciously
geppetto
seems
a
good
man
but
with
boys
he
is
a
regular
tyrant
if
that
poor
puppet
is
left
in
his
hands
he
is
quite
capable
of
tearing
him
in
pieces
it
ended
in
so
much
being
said
and
done
that
the
soldier
at
last
set
pinocchio
at
liberty
and
led
geppetto
to
prison
the
poor
man
not
being
ready
with
words
to
defend
himself
cried
like
a
calf
and
as
he
was
being
led
away
to
prison
sobbed
out
wretched
boy
and
to
think
how
i
labored
to
make
him
a
puppet
but
it
serves
me
right
i
should
have
thought
of
it
sooner

while
poor
geppetto
was
being
taken
to
prison
for
no
fault
of
his
that
imp
pinocchio
finding
himself
free
from
the
clutches
of
the
soldier
ran
off
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
that
he
might
reach
home
the
quicker
he
rushed
across
the
fields
and
in
his
mad
hurry
he
jumped
high
banks
thorn
hedges
and
ditches
full
of
water
arriving
at
the
house
he
found
the
street
door
ajar
he
pushed
it
open
went
in
and
having
fastened
the
latch
threw
himself
on
the
floor
and
gave
a
great
sigh
of
satisfaction
but
soon
he
heard
some
one
in
the
room
who
was
saying
who
calls
me
said
pinocchio
in
a
fright
it
is
i
pinocchio
turned
round
and
saw
a
big
cricket
crawling
slowly
up
the
wall
tell
me
cricket
who
may
you
be
i
am
the
and
i
have
lived
in
this
room
a
hundred
years
or
more
now
however
this
room
is
mine
said
the
puppet
and
if
you
would
do
me
a
pleasure
go
away
at
once
without
even
turning
round
i
will
not
go
answered
the
cricket
until
i
have
told
you
a
great
truth
tell
it
me
then
and
be
quick
about
it
woe
to
those
boys
who
rebel
against
their
parents
and
run
away
from
home
they
will
never
come
to
any
good
in
the
world
and
sooner
or
later
they
will
repent
bitterly
sing
away
cricket
as
you
please
and
as
long
as
you
please
for
me
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
run
away
tomorrow
at
daybreak
because
if
i
remain
i
shall
not
escape
the
fate
of
all
other
boys
i
shall
be
sent
to
school
and
shall
be
made
to
study
either
by
love
or
by
force
to
tell
you
in
confidence
i
have
no
wish
to
learn
it
is
much
more
amusing
to
run
after
butterflies
or
to
climb
trees
and
to
take
the
young
birds
out
of
their
nests
poor
little
goose
but
do
you
not
know
that
in
that
way
you
will
grow
up
a
perfect
donkey
and
that
every
one
will
make
fun
of
you
hold
your
tongue
you
wicked
croaker
shouted
pinocchio
but
the
cricket
who
was
patient
and
philosophical
instead
of
becoming
angry
at
this
impertinence
continued
in
the
same
tone
but
if
you
do
not
wish
to
go
to
school
why
not
at
least
learn
a
trade
if
only
to
enable
you
to
earn
honestly
a
piece
of
bread
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
replied
pinocchio
who
was
beginning
to
lose
patience
amongst
all
the
trades
in
the
world
there
is
only
one
that
really
takes
my
fancy
and
that
trade
what
is
it
it
is
to
eat
drink
sleep
and
amuse
myself
and
to
lead
a
vagabond
life
from
morning
to
night
as
a
rule
said
the
all
those
who
follow
that
trade
end
almost
always
either
in
a
hospital
or
in
prison
take
care
you
wicked
croaker
woe
to
you
if
i
fly
into
a
passion
poor
pinocchio
i
really
pity
you
why
do
you
pity
me
because
you
are
a
puppet
and
what
is
worse
because
you
have
a
wooden
head
at
these
last
words
pinocchio
jumped
up
in
a
rage
and
snatching
a
wooden
hammer
from
the
bench
he
threw
it
at
the
perhaps
he
never
meant
to
hit
him
but
unfortunately
it
struck
him
exactly
on
the
head
so
that
the
poor
cricket
had
scarcely
breath
to
cry
and
then
he
remained
dried
up
and
flattened
against
the
wall
illustration
chapter
v
the
flying
egg
night
was
coming
on
and
pinocchio
remembering
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
all
day
began
to
feel
a
gnawing
in
his
stomach
that
very
much
resembled
appetite
after
a
few
minutes
his
appetite
had
become
hunger
and
in
no
time
his
hunger
became
ravenous
poor
pinocchio
ran
quickly
to
the
fireplace
where
a
saucepan
was
boiling
and
was
going
to
take
off
the
lid
to
see
what
was
in
it
but
the
saucepan
was
only
painted
on
the
wall
you
can
imagine
his
feelings
his
nose
which
was
already
long
became
longer
by
at
least
three
inches
he
then
began
to
run
about
the
room
searching
in
the
drawers
and
in
every
imaginable
place
in
hopes
of
finding
a
bit
of
bread
if
it
was
only
a
bit
of
dry
bread
a
crust
a
bone
left
by
a
dog
a
little
moldy
pudding
of
indian
corn
a
fish
bone
a
cherry
stone
in
fact
anything
that
he
could
gnaw
but
he
could
find
nothing
nothing
at
all
absolutely
nothing
and
in
the
meanwhile
his
hunger
grew
and
grew
poor
pinocchio
had
no
other
relief
than
yawning
and
his
yawns
were
so
tremendous
that
sometimes
his
mouth
almost
reached
his
ears
and
after
he
had
yawned
he
spluttered
and
felt
as
if
he
were
going
to
faint
then
he
began
to
cry
desperately
and
he
said
the
was
right
i
did
wrong
to
rebel
against
my
papa
and
to
run
away
from
home
if
my
papa
were
here
i
should
not
now
be
dying
of
yawning
oh
what
a
dreadful
illness
hunger
is
just
then
he
thought
he
saw
something
in
the
something
round
and
white
that
looked
like
a
hen
egg
to
give
a
spring
and
seize
hold
of
it
was
the
affair
of
a
moment
it
was
indeed
an
egg
pinocchio
joy
was
beyond
description
almost
believing
it
must
be
a
dream
he
kept
turning
the
egg
over
in
his
hands
feeling
it
and
kissing
it
and
as
he
kissed
it
he
said
and
now
how
shall
i
cook
it
shall
i
make
an
omelet
no
it
would
be
better
to
cook
it
in
a
saucer
or
would
it
not
be
more
savory
to
fry
it
in
the
or
shall
i
simply
boil
it
no
the
quickest
way
of
all
is
to
cook
it
in
a
saucer
i
am
in
such
a
hurry
to
eat
it
without
loss
of
time
he
placed
an
earthenware
saucer
on
a
brazier
full
of
embers
into
the
saucer
instead
of
oil
or
butter
he
poured
a
little
water
and
when
the
water
began
to
smoke
tac
he
broke
the
over
it
and
let
the
contents
drop
in
but
instead
of
the
white
and
the
yolk
a
little
chicken
popped
out
very
gay
and
polite
making
a
beautiful
courtesy
it
said
to
him
a
thousand
thanks
master
pinocchio
for
saving
me
the
trouble
of
breaking
the
shell
adieu
until
we
meet
again
keep
well
and
my
best
compliments
to
all
at
home
thus
saying
it
spread
its
wings
darted
through
the
open
window
and
flying
away
was
lost
to
sight
the
poor
puppet
stood
as
if
he
had
been
bewitched
with
his
eyes
fixed
his
mouth
open
and
the
in
his
hand
recovering
however
from
his
first
stupefaction
he
began
to
cry
and
scream
and
to
stamp
his
feet
on
the
floor
in
desperation
and
amidst
his
sobs
he
said
ah
indeed
the
was
right
if
i
had
not
run
away
from
home
and
if
my
papa
were
here
i
should
not
now
be
dying
of
hunger
oh
what
a
dreadful
illness
hunger
is
and
as
his
stomach
cried
out
more
than
ever
and
he
did
not
know
how
to
quiet
it
he
thought
he
would
leave
the
house
and
make
an
excursion
in
the
neighborhood
in
hopes
of
finding
some
charitable
person
who
would
give
him
a
piece
of
bread

pinocchio
feet
burn
to
cinders
it
was
a
wild
and
stormy
night
the
thunder
was
tremendous
and
the
lightning
so
vivid
that
the
sky
seemed
on
fire
pinocchio
had
a
great
fear
of
thunder
but
hunger
was
stronger
than
fear
he
therefore
closed
the
house
door
and
made
a
rush
for
the
village
which
he
reached
in
a
hundred
bounds
with
his
tongue
hanging
out
and
panting
for
breath
like
a
dog
after
game
but
he
found
it
all
dark
and
deserted
the
shops
were
closed
the
windows
shut
and
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
dog
in
the
street
it
seemed
the
land
of
the
dead
pinocchio
urged
by
desperation
and
hunger
took
hold
of
the
bell
of
a
house
and
began
to
ring
it
with
all
his
might
saying
to
himself
that
will
bring
somebody
and
so
it
did
a
little
old
man
appeared
at
a
window
with
a
on
his
head
and
called
to
him
angrily
what
do
you
want
at
such
an
hour
would
you
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
a
little
bread
wait
there
i
will
be
back
directly
said
the
little
old
man
thinking
it
was
one
of
those
rascally
boys
who
amuse
themselves
at
night
by
ringing
the
to
rouse
respectable
people
who
are
sleeping
quietly
after
half
a
minute
the
window
was
again
opened
and
the
voice
of
the
same
little
old
man
shouted
to
pinocchio
come
underneath
and
hold
out
your
cap
pinocchio
pulled
off
his
cap
but
just
as
he
held
it
out
an
enormous
basin
of
water
was
poured
down
on
him
soaking
him
from
head
to
foot
as
if
he
had
been
a
pot
of
geraniums
he
returned
home
like
a
wet
chicken
quite
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
hunger
and
having
no
longer
strength
to
stand
he
sat
down
and
rested
his
damp
and
muddy
feet
on
a
brazier
full
of
burning
embers
and
then
he
fell
asleep
and
whilst
he
slept
his
feet
which
were
wooden
took
fire
and
little
by
little
they
burnt
away
and
became
cinders
pinocchio
continued
to
sleep
and
to
snore
as
if
his
feet
belonged
to
some
one
else
at
last
about
daybreak
he
awoke
because
some
one
was
knocking
at
the
door
who
is
there
he
asked
yawning
and
rubbing
his
eyes
it
is
i
answered
a
voice
and
pinocchio
recognized
geppetto
voice
chapter
vii
geppetto
gives
his
own
breakfast
to
pinocchio
poor
pinocchio
whose
eyes
were
still
half
shut
from
sleep
had
not
as
yet
discovered
that
his
feet
were
burnt
off
the
moment
therefore
that
he
heard
his
father
voice
he
slipped
off
his
stool
to
run
and
open
the
door
but
after
stumbling
two
or
three
times
he
fell
his
whole
length
on
the
floor
and
the
noise
he
made
in
falling
was
as
if
a
sack
of
wooden
ladles
had
been
thrown
from
a
fifth
story
open
the
door
shouted
geppetto
from
the
street
dear
papa
i
can
not
answered
the
puppet
crying
and
rolling
about
on
the
ground
why
ca
you
because
my
feet
have
been
eaten
and
who
has
eaten
your
feet
the
cat
said
pinocchio
seeing
the
cat
who
was
amusing
herself
by
making
some
shavings
dance
with
her
forepaws
open
the
door
i
tell
you
repeated
geppetto
if
you
do
when
i
get
into
the
house
you
shall
have
the
cat
from
me
i
can
not
stand
up
believe
me
oh
poor
me
poor
me
i
shall
have
to
walk
on
my
knees
for
the
rest
of
my
life
geppetto
believing
that
all
this
lamentation
was
only
another
of
the
puppet
tricks
thought
of
a
means
of
putting
an
end
to
it
and
climbing
up
the
wall
he
got
in
at
the
window
he
was
very
angry
and
at
first
he
did
nothing
but
scold
but
when
he
saw
his
pinocchio
lying
on
the
ground
and
really
without
feet
he
was
quite
overcome
he
took
him
in
his
arms
and
began
to
kiss
and
caress
him
and
to
say
a
thousand
endearing
things
to
him
and
as
the
big
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
he
said
sobbing
my
little
pinocchio
how
did
you
manage
to
burn
your
feet
i
do
know
papa
but
it
has
been
such
a
dreadful
night
that
i
shall
remember
it
as
long
as
i
live
it
thundered
and
lightened
and
i
was
very
hungry
and
then
the
said
to
me
serves
you
right
you
have
been
wicked
and
you
deserve
it
and
i
said
to
him
care
cricket
and
he
said
are
a
puppet
and
you
have
a
wooden
head
and
i
threw
the
handle
of
a
hammer
at
him
and
he
died
but
the
fault
was
his
for
i
did
wish
to
kill
him
and
the
proof
of
it
is
that
i
put
an
earthenware
saucer
on
a
brazier
of
burning
embers
but
a
chicken
flew
out
and
said
until
we
meet
again
and
many
compliments
to
all
at
home
and
i
got
still
more
hungry
for
which
reason
that
little
old
man
in
a
opening
the
window
said
to
me
underneath
and
hold
out
your
hat
and
poured
a
basinful
of
water
on
my
head
because
asking
for
a
little
bread
is
a
disgrace
is
it
and
i
returned
home
at
once
and
because
i
was
always
very
hungry
i
put
my
feet
on
the
brazier
to
dry
them
and
then
you
returned
and
i
found
they
were
burnt
off
and
i
am
always
hungry
but
i
have
no
longer
any
feet
oh
oh
oh
oh
and
poor
pinocchio
began
to
cry
and
to
roar
so
loudly
that
he
was
heard
five
miles
off
geppetto
who
from
all
this
jumbled
account
had
only
understood
one
thing
which
was
that
the
puppet
was
dying
of
hunger
drew
from
his
pocket
three
pears
and
giving
them
to
him
said
these
three
pears
were
intended
for
my
breakfast
but
i
will
give
them
to
you
willingly
eat
them
and
i
hope
they
will
do
you
good
if
you
wish
me
to
eat
them
be
kind
enough
to
peel
them
for
me
peel
them
said
geppetto
astonished
i
should
never
have
thought
my
boy
that
you
were
so
dainty
and
fastidious
that
is
bad
in
this
world
we
should
accustom
ourselves
from
childhood
to
like
and
to
eat
everything
for
there
is
no
saying
to
what
we
may
be
brought
there
are
so
many
chances
you
are
no
doubt
right
interrupted
pinocchio
but
i
will
never
eat
fruit
that
has
not
been
peeled
i
can
not
bear
rind
so
good
geppetto
peeled
the
three
pears
and
put
the
rind
on
a
corner
of
the
table
having
eaten
the
first
pear
in
two
mouthfuls
pinocchio
was
about
to
throw
away
the
core
but
geppetto
caught
hold
of
his
arm
and
said
to
him
do
not
throw
it
away
in
this
world
everything
may
be
of
use
but
core
i
am
determined
i
will
not
eat
shouted
the
puppet
turning
upon
him
like
a
viper
who
knows
there
are
so
many
chances
repeated
geppetto
without
losing
his
temper
and
so
the
three
cores
instead
of
being
thrown
out
of
the
window
were
placed
on
the
corner
of
the
table
together
with
the
three
rinds
having
eaten
or
rather
having
devoured
the
three
pears
pinocchio
yawned
tremendously
and
then
said
in
a
fretful
tone
i
am
as
hungry
as
ever
but
my
boy
i
have
nothing
more
to
give
you
nothing
really
nothing
i
have
only
the
rind
and
the
cores
of
the
three
pears
one
must
have
patience
said
pinocchio
if
there
is
nothing
else
i
will
eat
a
rind
and
he
began
to
chew
it
at
first
he
made
a
wry
face
but
then
one
after
another
he
quickly
disposed
of
the
rinds
and
after
the
rinds
even
the
cores
and
when
he
had
eaten
up
everything
he
clapped
his
hands
on
his
sides
in
his
satisfaction
and
said
joyfully
ah
now
i
feel
comfortable
you
see
now
observed
geppetto
that
i
was
right
when
i
said
to
you
that
it
did
not
do
to
accustom
ourselves
to
be
too
particular
or
too
dainty
in
our
tastes
we
can
never
know
my
dear
boy
what
may
happen
to
us
there
are
so
many
chances

geppetto
makes
pinocchio
new
feet
no
sooner
had
the
puppet
satisfied
his
hunger
than
he
began
to
cry
and
to
grumble
because
he
wanted
a
pair
of
new
feet
but
geppetto
to
punish
him
for
his
naughtiness
allowed
him
to
cry
and
to
despair
for
half
the
day
he
then
said
to
him
why
should
i
make
you
new
feet
to
enable
you
perhaps
to
escape
again
from
home
i
promise
you
said
the
puppet
sobbing
that
for
the
future
i
will
be
good
all
boys
replied
geppetto
when
they
are
bent
upon
obtaining
something
say
the
same
thing
i
promise
you
that
i
will
go
to
school
and
that
i
will
study
and
bring
home
a
good
report
all
boys
when
they
are
bent
on
obtaining
something
repeat
the
same
story
but
i
am
not
like
other
boys
i
am
better
than
all
of
them
and
i
always
speak
the
truth
i
promise
you
papa
that
i
will
learn
a
trade
and
that
i
will
be
the
consolation
and
the
staff
of
your
old
age
geppetto
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
his
heart
was
sad
at
seeing
his
poor
pinocchio
in
such
a
pitiable
state
he
did
not
say
another
word
but
taking
his
tools
and
two
small
pieces
of
wood
he
set
to
work
with
great
diligence
in
less
than
an
hour
the
feet
were
finished
two
little
feet
swift
and
nervous
they
might
have
been
modelled
by
an
artist
of
genius
geppetto
then
said
to
the
puppet
shut
your
eyes
and
go
to
sleep
and
pinocchio
shut
his
eyes
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
and
whilst
he
pretended
to
sleep
geppetto
with
a
little
glue
which
he
had
melted
in
an
fastened
his
feet
in
their
place
and
it
was
so
well
done
that
not
even
a
trace
could
be
seen
of
where
they
were
joined
no
sooner
had
the
puppet
discovered
that
he
had
feet
than
he
jumped
down
from
the
table
on
which
he
was
lying
and
began
to
spring
and
to
cut
a
thousand
capers
about
the
room
as
if
he
had
gone
mad
with
the
greatness
of
his
delight
to
reward
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
said
pinocchio
to
his
father
i
will
go
to
school
at
once
good
boy
but
to
go
to
school
i
shall
want
some
clothes
geppetto
who
was
poor
and
who
had
not
so
much
as
a
penny
in
his
pocket
then
made
him
a
little
dress
of
flowered
paper
a
pair
of
shoes
from
the
bark
of
a
tree
and
a
cap
of
the
crumb
of
bread
pinocchio
ran
immediately
to
look
at
himself
in
a
crock
of
water
and
he
was
so
pleased
with
his
appearance
that
he
said
strutting
about
like
a
peacock
i
look
quite
like
a
gentleman
yes
indeed
answered
geppetto
for
bear
in
mind
that
it
is
not
fine
clothes
that
make
the
gentleman
but
rather
clean
clothes
by
the
bye
added
the
puppet
to
go
to
school
i
am
still
in
want
indeed
i
am
without
the
best
thing
and
the
most
important
and
what
is
it
i
have
no
you
are
right
but
what
shall
we
do
to
get
one
it
is
quite
easy
we
have
only
to
go
to
the
bookseller
and
buy
it
and
the
money
i
have
got
none
neither
have
i
added
the
good
old
man
very
sadly
and
pinocchio
although
he
was
a
very
merry
boy
became
sad
also
because
poverty
when
it
is
real
poverty
is
understood
by
everybody
even
by
boys
well
patience
exclaimed
geppetto
all
at
once
rising
to
his
feet
and
putting
on
his
old
corduroy
coat
all
patched
and
darned
he
ran
out
of
the
house
he
returned
shortly
holding
in
his
hand
a
for
pinocchio
but
the
old
coat
was
gone
the
poor
man
was
in
his
and
out
of
doors
it
was
snowing
and
the
coat
papa
i
have
sold
it
why
did
you
sell
it
because
i
found
it
too
hot
pinocchio
understood
this
answer
in
an
instant
and
unable
to
restrain
the
impulse
of
his
good
heart
he
sprang
up
and
throwing
his
arms
around
geppetto
neck
he
began
kissing
him
again
and
again
chapter
ix
pinocchio
goes
to
see
a
as
soon
as
it
stopped
snowing
pinocchio
set
out
for
school
with
his
fine
under
his
arm
as
he
went
along
he
began
to
imagine
a
thousand
things
in
his
little
brain
and
to
build
a
thousand
castles
in
the
air
one
more
beautiful
than
the
other
and
talking
to
himself
he
said
today
at
school
i
will
learn
to
read
at
once
then
tomorrow
i
will
begin
to
write
and
the
day
after
tomorrow
to
figure
then
with
my
acquirements
i
will
earn
a
great
deal
of
money
and
with
the
first
money
i
have
in
my
pocket
i
will
immediately
buy
for
my
papa
a
beautiful
new
cloth
coat
but
what
am
i
saying
cloth
indeed
it
shall
be
all
made
of
gold
and
silver
and
it
shall
have
diamond
buttons
that
poor
man
really
deserves
it
for
to
buy
me
books
and
have
me
taught
he
has
remained
in
his
and
in
this
cold
it
is
only
fathers
who
are
capable
of
such
sacrifices
whilst
he
was
saying
this
with
great
emotion
he
thought
that
he
heard
music
in
the
distance
that
sounded
like
fifes
and
the
beating
of
a
big
drum
zum
zum
zum
he
stopped
and
listened
the
sounds
came
from
the
end
of
a
cross
street
that
led
to
a
little
village
on
the
seashore
what
can
that
music
be
what
a
pity
that
i
have
to
go
to
school
or
else
and
he
remained
irresolute
it
was
however
necessary
to
come
to
a
decision
should
he
go
to
school
or
should
he
go
after
the
fifes
today
i
will
go
and
hear
the
fifes
and
tomorrow
i
will
go
to
school
finally
decided
the
young
scapegrace
shrugging
his
shoulders
the
more
he
ran
the
nearer
came
the
sounds
of
the
fifes
and
the
beating
of
the
big
drum
zum
zum
zum
zum
at
last
he
found
himself
in
the
middle
of
a
square
quite
full
of
people
who
were
all
crowded
round
a
building
made
of
wood
and
canvas
and
painted
a
thousand
colors
what
is
that
building
asked
pinocchio
turning
to
a
little
boy
who
belonged
to
the
place
read
the
placard
it
is
all
written
and
then
you
will
know
i
would
read
it
willingly
but
it
so
happens
that
today
i
do
know
how
to
read
bravo
blockhead
then
i
will
read
it
to
you
the
writing
on
that
placard
in
those
letters
red
as
fire
is
the
great
puppet
theater
has
the
play
begun
long
it
is
beginning
now
how
much
does
it
cost
to
go
in
a
dime
pinocchio
who
was
in
a
fever
of
curiosity
lost
all
control
of
himself
and
without
any
shame
he
said
to
the
little
boy
to
whom
he
was
talking
would
you
lend
me
a
dime
until
tomorrow
i
would
lend
it
to
you
willingly
said
the
other
but
it
so
happens
that
today
i
can
not
give
it
to
you
i
will
sell
you
my
jacket
for
a
dime
the
puppet
then
said
to
him
what
do
you
think
that
i
could
do
with
a
jacket
of
flowered
paper
if
there
were
rain
and
it
got
wet
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
it
off
my
back
will
you
buy
my
shoes
they
would
only
be
of
use
to
light
the
fire
how
much
will
you
give
me
for
my
cap
that
would
be
a
wonderful
acquisition
indeed
a
cap
of
bread
crumb
there
would
be
a
risk
of
the
mice
coming
to
eat
it
whilst
it
was
on
my
head
pinocchio
was
on
thorns
he
was
on
the
point
of
making
another
offer
but
he
had
not
the
courage
he
hesitated
felt
irresolute
and
remorseful
at
last
he
said
will
you
give
me
a
dime
for
this
new
i
am
a
boy
and
i
do
buy
from
boys
replied
his
little
interlocutor
who
had
much
more
sense
than
he
had
i
will
buy
the
for
a
dime
called
out
a
hawker
of
old
clothes
who
had
been
listening
to
the
conversation
and
the
book
was
sold
there
and
then
and
to
think
that
poor
geppetto
had
remained
at
home
trembling
with
cold
in
his
in
order
that
his
son
should
have
a
chapter
x
the
puppets
recognize
their
brother
pinocchio
when
pinocchio
came
into
the
little
puppet
theater
an
incident
occurred
that
almost
produced
a
revolution
the
curtain
had
gone
up
and
the
play
had
already
begun
on
the
stage
harlequin
and
punch
were
as
usual
quarrelling
with
each
other
and
threatening
every
moment
to
come
to
blows
all
at
once
harlequin
stopped
short
and
turning
to
the
public
he
pointed
with
his
hand
to
some
one
far
down
in
the
pit
and
exclaimed
in
a
dramatic
tone
gods
of
the
firmament
do
i
dream
or
am
i
awake
but
surely
that
is
pinocchio
it
is
indeed
pinocchio
cried
punch
it
is
indeed
himself
screamed
miss
rose
peeping
from
behind
the
scenes
it
is
pinocchio
it
is
pinocchio
shouted
all
the
puppets
in
chorus
leaping
from
all
sides
on
to
the
stage
it
is
pinocchio
it
is
our
brother
pinocchio
long
live
pinocchio
pinocchio
come
up
here
to
me
cried
harlequin
and
throw
yourself
into
the
arms
of
your
wooden
brothers
at
this
affectionate
invitation
pinocchio
made
a
leap
from
the
end
of
the
pit
into
the
reserved
seats
another
leap
landed
him
on
the
head
of
the
leader
of
the
orchestra
and
he
then
sprang
upon
the
stage
the
embraces
the
friendly
pinches
and
the
demonstrations
of
warm
brotherly
affection
that
pinocchio
received
from
the
excited
crowd
of
actors
and
actresses
of
the
puppet
dramatic
company
are
beyond
description
the
sight
was
doubtless
a
moving
one
but
the
public
in
the
pit
finding
that
the
play
was
stopped
became
impatient
and
began
to
shout
we
will
have
the
play
go
on
with
the
play
it
was
all
breath
thrown
away
the
puppets
instead
of
continuing
the
recital
redoubled
their
noise
and
outcries
and
putting
pinocchio
on
their
shoulders
they
carried
him
in
triumph
before
the
footlights
at
that
moment
out
came
the
showman
he
was
very
big
and
so
ugly
that
the
sight
of
him
was
enough
to
frighten
anyone
his
beard
was
as
black
as
ink
and
so
long
that
it
reached
from
his
chin
to
the
ground
i
need
only
say
that
he
trod
upon
it
when
he
walked
his
mouth
was
as
big
as
an
oven
and
his
eyes
were
like
two
lanterns
of
red
glass
with
lights
burning
inside
them
he
carried
a
large
whip
made
of
snakes
and
tails
twisted
together
which
he
cracked
constantly
at
his
unexpected
appearance
there
was
a
profound
silence
no
one
dared
to
breathe
a
fly
might
have
been
heard
in
the
stillness
the
poor
puppets
of
both
sexes
trembled
like
so
many
leaves
why
have
you
come
to
raise
a
disturbance
in
my
theater
asked
the
showman
of
pinocchio
in
the
gruff
voice
of
a
hobgoblin
suffering
from
a
severe
cold
in
the
head
believe
me
honored
sir
it
was
not
my
fault
that
is
enough
tonight
we
will
settle
our
accounts
as
soon
as
the
play
was
over
the
showman
went
into
the
kitchen
where
a
fine
sheep
preparing
for
his
supper
was
turning
slowly
on
the
spit
in
front
of
the
fire
as
there
was
not
enough
wood
to
finish
roasting
and
browning
it
he
called
harlequin
and
punch
and
said
to
them
bring
that
puppet
here
you
will
find
him
hanging
on
a
nail
it
seems
to
me
that
he
is
made
of
very
dry
wood
and
i
am
sure
that
if
he
were
thrown
on
the
fire
he
would
make
a
beautiful
blaze
for
the
roast
at
first
harlequin
and
punch
hesitated
but
appalled
by
a
severe
glance
from
their
master
they
obeyed
in
a
short
time
they
returned
to
the
kitchen
carrying
poor
pinocchio
who
was
wriggling
like
an
eel
taken
out
of
water
and
screaming
desperately

sneezes
and
pardons
pinocchio
the
showman
for
that
was
his
name
looked
like
a
wicked
man
especially
with
his
black
beard
that
covered
his
chest
and
legs
like
an
apron
on
the
whole
however
he
had
not
a
bad
heart
in
proof
of
this
when
he
saw
poor
pinocchio
brought
before
him
struggling
and
screaming
i
will
not

i
will
not
die
he
was
quite
moved
and
felt
very
sorry
for
him
he
tried
to
hold
out
but
after
a
little
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
he
sneezed
violently
when
he
heard
the
sneeze
harlequin
who
up
to
that
moment
had
been
in
the
deepest
affliction
and
bowed
down
like
a
weeping
willow
became
quite
cheerful
and
leaning
towards
pinocchio
he
whispered
to
him
softly
good
news
brother
the
showman
has
sneezed
and
that
is
a
sign
that
he
pities
you
and
consequently
you
are
saved
most
men
when
they
feel
compassion
for
somebody
either
weep
or
at
least
pretend
to
dry
their
eyes
on
the
contrary
whenever
he
was
really
overcome
had
the
habit
of
sneezing
after
he
had
sneezed
the
showman
still
acting
the
ruffian
shouted
to
pinocchio
have
done
crying
your
lamentations
have
given
me
a
pain
in
my
stomach
i
feel

spasm
that
almost

he
sneezed

still
alive
asked
papa
yes
my

i
have
never

what
a
sorrow
it
would

and
he
sneezed

three

said
pinocchio
thank
you
all
the

some
compassion
is
due
to
me
for
as
you
see
i
have
no
more
wood
with
which
to
finish
roasting
my
mutton
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
under
the
circumstances
you
would
have
been
of
great
use
to
me
however
i
have
had
pity
on
you
so
i
must
have
patience
instead
of
you
i
will
burn
under
the
spit
one
of
the
puppets
belonging
to
my
company
ho
there
gendarmes
at
this
call
two
wooden
gendarmes
immediately
appeared
they
were
very
long
and
very
thin
and
had
on
cocked
hats
and
held
unsheathed
swords
in
their
hands
the
showman
said
to
them
in
a
hoarse
voice
take
harlequin
bind
him
securely
and
then
throw
him
on
the
fire
to
burn
i
am
determined
that
my
mutton
shall
be
well
roasted
only
imagine
that
poor
harlequin
his
terror
was
so
great
that
his
legs
bent
under
him
and
he
fell
with
his
face
on
the
ground
at
this
agonizing
sight
pinocchio
weeping
bitterly
threw
himself
at
the
showman
feet
and
bathing
his
long
beard
with
his
tears
he
began
to
say
in
a
supplicating
voice
have
pity
sir
here
there
are
no
sirs
the
showman
answered
severely
have
pity

there

no

there
are
no
commanders
have
pity
excellence
upon
hearing
himself
called
excellence
the
showman
began
to
smile
and
became
at
once
kinder
and
more
tractable
turning
to
pinocchio
he
asked
well
what
do
you
want
from
me
i
implore
you
to
pardon
poor
harlequin
for
him
there
can
be
no
pardon
as
i
have
spared
you
he
must
be
put
on
the
fire
for
i
am
determined
that
my
mutton
shall
be
well
roasted
in
that
case
cried
pinocchio
proudly
rising
and
throwing
away
his
cap
of
bread
crumb
in
that
case
i
know
my
duty
come
on
gendarmes
bind
me
and
throw
me
amongst
the
flames
no
it
is
not
just
that
poor
harlequin
my
true
friend
should
die
for
me
these
words
pronounced
in
a
loud
heroic
voice
made
all
the
puppets
who
were
present
cry
even
the
gendarmes
although
they
were
made
of
wood
wept
like
two
newly
born
lambs
at
first
remained
as
hard
and
unmoved
as
ice
but
little
by
little
he
began
to
melt
and
to
sneeze
and
having
sneezed
four
or
five
times
he
opened
his
arms
affectionately
and
said
to
pinocchio
you
are
a
good
brave
boy
come
here
and
give
me
a
kiss
pinocchio
ran
at
once
and
climbing
like
a
squirrel
up
the
beard
he
deposited
a
hearty
kiss
on
the
point
of
his
nose
then
the
pardon
is
granted
asked
poor
harlequin
in
a
faint
voice
that
was
scarcely
audible
the
pardon
is
granted
answered
he
then
added
sighing
and
shaking
his
head
i
must
have
patience
tonight
i
shall
have
to
resign
myself
to
eat
the
mutton
half
raw
but
another
time
woe
to
him
who
displeases
me
at
the
news
of
the
pardon
the
puppets
all
ran
to
the
stage
and
having
lighted
the
lamps
and
chandeliers
as
if
for
a
performance
they
began
to
leap
and
to
dance
merrily
at
dawn
they
were
still

pinocchio
receives
a
present
of
five
gold
pieces
the
following
day
called
pinocchio
to
one
side
and
asked
him
what
is
your
father
name
geppetto
and
what
trade
does
he
follow
he
is
a
beggar
does
he
gain
much
gain
much
why
he
has
never
a
penny
in
his
pocket
only
think
in
order
to
buy
a
so
that
i
could
go
to
school
he
was
obliged
to
sell
the
only
coat
he
had
to
wear
a
coat
that
between
patches
and
darns
was
not
fit
to
be
seen
poor
devil
i
feel
almost
sorry
for
him
here
are
five
gold
pieces
go
at
once
and
take
them
to
him
with
my
compliments
pinocchio
was
overjoyed
and
thanked
the
showman
a
thousand
times
he
embraced
all
the
puppets
of
the
company
one
by
one
even
to
the
gendarmes
and
set
out
to
return
home
but
he
had
not
gone
far
when
he
met
on
the
road
a
fox
lame
of
one
foot
and
a
cat
blind
of
both
eyes
and
they
were
going
along
helping
each
other
like
good
companions
in
misfortune
the
fox
who
was
lame
walked
leaning
on
the
cat
and
the
cat
who
was
blind
was
guided
by
the
fox
pinocchio
said
the
fox
greeting
him
politely
how
do
you
come
to
know
my
name
asked
the
puppet
i
know
your
father
well
where
did
you
see
him
i
saw
him
yesterday
at
the
door
of
his
house
and
what
was
he
doing
he
was
in
his
and
shivering
with
cold
poor
papa
but
that
is
over
for
the
future
he
shall
shiver
no
more
why
because
i
have
become
a
gentleman
a
gentleman
you
said
the
fox
and
he
began
to
laugh
rudely
and
scornfully
the
cat
also
began
to
laugh
but
to
conceal
it
she
combed
her
whiskers
with
her
forepaws
illustration
splash
splash
they
fell
into
the
very
middle
of
the
ditch
there
is
little
to
laugh
at
cried
pinocchio
angrily
i
am
really
sorry
to
make
your
mouth
water
but
if
you
know
anything
about
it
you
can
see
that
these
are
five
gold
pieces
and
he
pulled
out
the
money
that
had
given
him
at
the
jingling
of
the
money
the
fox
with
an
involuntary
movement
stretched
out
the
paw
that
seemed
crippled
and
the
cat
opened
wide
two
eyes
that
looked
like
two
green
lanterns
it
is
true
that
she
shut
them
again
and
so
quickly
that
pinocchio
observed
nothing
and
now
asked
the
fox
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
all
that
money
first
of
all
answered
the
puppet
i
intend
to
buy
a
new
coat
for
my
papa
made
of
gold
and
silver
and
with
diamond
buttons
and
then
i
will
buy
a
for
myself
for
yourself
yes
indeed
for
i
wish
to
go
to
school
to
study
in
earnest
look
at
me
said
the
fox
through
my
foolish
passion
for
study
i
have
lost
a
leg
look
at
me
said
the
cat
through
my
foolish
passion
for
study
i
have
lost
the
sight
of
both
my
eyes
at
that
moment
a
white
blackbird
that
was
perched
on
the
hedge
by
the
road
began
his
usual
song
and
said
pinocchio
do
listen
to
the
advice
of
bad
companions
if
you
do
you
will
repent
it
poor
blackbird
if
only
he
had
not
spoken
the
cat
with
a
great
leap
sprang
upon
him
and
without
even
giving
him
time
to
say
oh
ate
him
in
a
mouthful
feathers
and
all
having
eaten
him
and
cleaned
her
mouth
she
shut
her
eyes
again
and
feigned
blindness
as
before
poor
blackbird
said
pinocchio
to
the
cat
why
did
you
treat
him
so
badly
i
did
it
to
give
him
a
lesson
he
will
learn
another
time
not
to
meddle
in
other
people
conversation
they
had
gone
almost
when
the
fox
halting
suddenly
said
to
the
puppet
would
you
like
to
double
your
money
in
what
way
would
you
like
to
make
out
of
your
five
miserable
sovereigns
a
hundred
a
thousand
two
thousand
i
should
think
so
but
in
what
way
the
way
is
easy
enough
instead
of
returning
home
you
must
go
with
us
and
where
do
you
wish
to
take
me
to
the
land
of
the
owls
pinocchio
reflected
a
moment
and
then
he
said
resolutely
no
i
will
not
go
i
am
already
close
to
the
house
and
i
will
return
home
to
my
papa
who
is
waiting
for
me
who
can
tell
how
often
the
poor
old
man
must
have
sighed
yesterday
when
i
did
not
come
back
i
have
indeed
been
a
bad
son
and
the
was
right
when
he
said
boys
never
come
to
any
good
in
the
world
i
have
found
it
to
be
true
for
many
misfortunes
have
happened
to
me
even
yesterday
in
house
i
ran
the
risk
oh
it
makes
me
shudder
only
to
think
of
it
well
then
said
the
fox
you
are
quite
decided
to
go
home
go
then
and
so
much
the
worse
for
you
so
much
the
worse
for
you
repeated
the
cat
think
well
of
it
pinocchio
for
you
are
giving
a
kick
to
fortune
to
fortune
repeated
the
cat
between
today
and
tomorrow
your
five
sovereigns
would
have
become
two
thousand
two
thousand
repeated
the
cat
but
how
is
it
possible
that
they
could
become
so
many
asked
pinocchio
remaining
with
his
mouth
open
from
astonishment
i
will
explain
it
to
you
at
once
said
the
fox
you
must
know
that
in
the
land
of
the
owls
there
is
a
sacred
field
called
by
everybody
the
field
of
miracles
in
this
field
you
must
dig
a
little
hole
and
you
put
into
it
we
will
say
one
gold
sovereign
you
then
cover
up
the
hole
with
a
little
earth
you
must
water
it
with
two
pails
of
water
from
the
fountain
then
sprinkle
it
with
two
pinches
of
salt
and
when
night
comes
you
can
go
quietly
to
bed
in
the
meanwhile
during
the
night
the
gold
piece
will
grow
and
flower
and
in
the
morning
when
you
get
up
and
return
to
the
field
what
do
you
find
you
find
a
beautiful
tree
laden
with
as
many
gold
sovereigns
as
a
fine
ear
of
corn
has
grains
in
the
month
of
june
so
that
said
pinocchio
more
and
more
bewildered
supposing
i
buried
my
five
sovereigns
in
that
field
how
many
should
i
find
there
the
following
morning
that
is
an
exceedingly
easy
calculation
replied
the
fox
a
calculation
that
you
can
make
on
the
ends
of
your
fingers
every
sovereign
will
give
you
an
increase
of
five
hundred
multiply
five
hundred
by
five
and
the
following
morning
will
find
you
with
two
thousand
five
hundred
shining
gold
pieces
in
your
pocket
oh
how
delightful
cried
pinocchio
dancing
for
joy
as
soon
as
ever
i
have
obtained
those
sovereigns
i
will
keep
two
thousand
for
myself
and
the
other
five
hundred
i
will
make
a
present
of
to
you
two
a
present
to
us
cried
the
fox
with
indignation
and
appearing
much
offended
what
are
you
dreaming
of
what
are
you
dreaming
of
repeated
the
cat
we
do
not
work
said
the
fox
for
interest
we
work
solely
to
enrich
others
others
repeated
the
cat
what
good
people
thought
pinocchio
to
himself
and
forgetting
there
and
then
his
papa
the
new
coat
the
and
all
his
good
resolutions
he
said
to
the
fox
and
the
cat
let
us
be
off
at
once
i
will
go

you

they
walked
and
walked
and
walked
until
at
last
towards
evening
they
arrived
all
tired
out
at
the
inn
of
the
red
let
us
stop
here
a
little
said
the
fox
that
we
may
have
something
to
eat
and
rest
ourselves
for
an
hour
or
two
we
will
start
again
at
midnight
so
as
to
arrive
at
the
field
of
miracles
by
dawn
tomorrow
morning
having
gone
into
the
inn
they
all
three
sat
down
to
table
but
none
of
them
had
any
appetite
the
cat
who
was
suffering
from
indigestion
and
feeling
seriously
indisposed
could
only
eat
fish
with
tomato
sauce
and
four
portions
of
tripe
with
parmesan
cheese
and
because
she
thought
the
tripe
was
not
seasoned
enough
she
asked
three
times
for
the
butter
and
grated
cheese
the
fox
would
also
willingly
have
picked
a
little
but
as
his
doctor
had
ordered
him
a
strict
diet
he
was
forced
to
content
himself
simply
with
a
hare
dressed
with
a
sweet
and
sour
sauce
and
garnished
lightly
with
fat
chickens
and
early
pullets
after
the
hare
he
sent
for
a
made
dish
of
partridges
rabbits
frogs
lizards
and
other
delicacies
he
could
not
touch
anything
else
he
cared
so
little
for
food
he
said
that
he
could
put
nothing
to
his
lips
the
one
who
ate
the
least
was
pinocchio
he
asked
for
some
walnuts
and
a
hunch
of
bread
and
left
everything
on
his
plate
the
poor
thoughts
were
continually
fixed
on
the
field
of
miracles
when
they
had
supped
the
fox
said
to
the
host
give
us
two
good
rooms
one
for
pinocchio
and
the
other
for
me
and
my
companion
we
will
snatch
a
little
sleep
before
we
leave
remember
however
that
at
midnight
we
wish
to
be
called
to
continue
our
journey
yes
gentlemen
answered
the
host
and
he
winked
at
the
fox
and
the
cat
as
much
as
to
say
i
know
what
you
are
up
to
we
understand
one
another
no
sooner
had
pinocchio
got
into
bed
than
he
fell
asleep
at
once
and
began
to
dream
and
he
dreamed
that
he
was
in
the
middle
of
a
field
and
the
field
was
full
of
shrubs
covered
with
clusters
of
gold
sovereigns
and
as
they
swung
in
the
wind
they
went
zin
zin
zin
almost
as
if
they
would
say
let
who
will
come
and
take
us
but
just
as
pinocchio
was
stretching
out
his
hand
to
pick
handfuls
of
those
beautiful
gold
pieces
and
to
put
them
in
his
pocket
he
was
suddenly
awakened
by
three
violent
blows
on
the
door
of
his
room
it
was
the
host
who
had
come
to
tell
him
that
midnight
had
struck
are
my
companions
ready
asked
the
puppet
ready
why
they
left
two
hours
ago
why
were
they
in
such
a
hurry
because
the
cat
had
received
a
message
to
say
that
her
eldest
kitten
was
ill
with
chilblains
on
his
feet
and
was
in
danger
of
death
did
they
pay
for
the
supper
what
are
you
thinking
of
they
are
too
well
educated
to
dream
of
offering
such
an
insult
to
a
gentleman
like
you
what
a
pity
it
is
an
insult
that
would
have
given
me
so
much
pleasure
said
pinocchio
scratching
his
head
he
then
asked
and
where
did
my
good
friends
say
they
would
wait
for
me
at
the
field
of
miracles
tomorrow
morning
at
daybreak
pinocchio
paid
a
sovereign
for
his
supper
and
that
of
his
companions
and
then
left
outside
the
inn
it
was
so
pitch
dark
that
he
had
almost
to
grope
his
way
for
it
was
impossible
to
see
a
hand
breadth
in
front
of
him
some
flying
across
the
road
from
one
hedge
to
the
other
brushed
pinocchio
nose
with
their
wings
as
they
passed
which
caused
him
so
much
terror
that
springing
back
he
shouted
who
goes
there
and
the
echo
in
the
surrounding
hills
repeated
in
the
distance
who
goes
there
who
goes
there
as
he
was
walking
along
he
saw
a
little
insect
shining
dimly
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
like
a
in
a
lamp
of
transparent
china
who
are
you
asked
pinocchio
i
am
the
ghost
of
the
answered
the
insect
in
a
low
voice
so
weak
and
faint
that
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
other
world
what
do
you
want
with
me
said
the
puppet
i
want
to
give
you
some
advice
go
back
and
take
the
four
sovereigns
that
you
have
left
to
your
poor
father
who
is
weeping
and
in
despair
because
you
have
not
returned
to
him
by
tomorrow
my
papa
will
be
a
gentleman
for
these
four
sovereigns
will
have
become
two
thousand

trust
to
those
who
promise
to
make
you
rich
in
a
day
usually
they
are
either
mad
or
rogues

ear
to

it
always
the

may
heaven
preserve
you
from

had

said

pinocchio
falls
amongst
assassins
really
said
the
puppet
to
himself
as
he
resumed
his
journey
how
unfortunate
we
poor
boys
are
everybody
scolds
us
and
gives
us
good
advice
see
now
because
i
do
choose
to
listen
to
that
tiresome
cricket
who
knows
according
to
him
how
many
misfortunes
are
to
happen
to
me
i
am
even
to
meet
with
assassins
that
is
however
of
little
consequence
for
i
do
believe
in
assassins
i
have
never
believed
in
them
for
me
i
think
that
assassins
have
been
invented
purposely
by
papas
to
frighten
boys
who
want
to
go
out
at
night
besides
supposing
i
was
to
come
across
them
here
in
the
road
do
you
imagine
they
would
frighten
me
not
the
least
in
the
world
i
should
go
to
meet
them
and
cry
assassins
what
do
you
want
with
me
remember
that
with
me
there
is
no
joking
therefore
go
about
your
business
and
be
quiet
at
this
speech

would
run
away
like
the
wind
if
however
they
were
so
badly
educated
as
not
to
run
away
why
then
i
would
run
away
myself
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
it
but
pinocchio
had
not
time
to
finish
his
reasoning
for
at
that
moment
he
thought
that
he
heard
a
slight
rustle
of
leaves
behind
him
he
turned
to
look
and
saw
in
the
gloom
two
black
figures
completely
enveloped
in
charcoal
sacks
they
were
running
after
him
on
tiptoe
and
making
great
leaps
like
two
phantoms
here
they
are
in
reality
he
said
to
himself
and
not
knowing
where
to
hide
his
gold
pieces
he
put
them
in
his
mouth
precisely
under
his
tongue
then
he
tried
to
escape
but
he
had
not
gone
a
step
when
he
felt
himself
seized
by
the
arm
and
heard
two
horrid
sepulchral
voices
saying
to
him
your
money
or
your
life
pinocchio
not
being
able
to
answer
in
words
owing
to
the
money
that
was
in
his
mouth
made
a
thousand
low
bows
and
a
thousand
pantomimes
he
tried
thus
to
make
the
two
muffled
figures
whose
eyes
were
only
visible
through
the
holes
in
their
sacks
understand
that
he
was
a
poor
puppet
and
that
he
had
not
as
much
as
a
counterfeit
nickel
in
his
pocket
come
now
less
nonsense
and
out
with
the
money
cried
the
two
brigands
threateningly
and
the
puppet
made
a
gesture
with
his
hands
to
signify
i
have
none
deliver
up
your
money
or
you
are
dead
said
the
tallest
of
the
brigands
dead
repeated
the
other
and
after
we
have
killed
you
we
will
also
kill
your
father
also
your
father
no
no
no
not
my
poor
papa
cried
pinocchio
in
a
despairing
voice
and
as
he
said
it
the
sovereigns
clinked
in
his
mouth
ah
you
rascal
then
you
have
hidden
your
money
under
your
tongue
spit
it
out
at
once
pinocchio
was
obstinate
ah
you
pretend
to
be
deaf
do
you
wait
a
moment
leave
it
to
us
to
find
a
means
to
make
you
give
it
up
and
one
of
them
seized
the
puppet
by
the
end
of
his
nose
and
the
other
took
him
by
the
chin
and
began
to
pull
them
brutally
the
one
up
and
the
other
down
to
force
him
to
open
his
mouth
but
it
was
all
to
no
purpose
pinocchio
mouth
seemed
to
be
nailed
and
riveted
together
then
the
shorter
assassin
drew
out
an
ugly
knife
and
tried
to
put
it
between
his
lips
like
a
lever
or
chisel
but
pinocchio
as
quick
as
lightning
caught
his
hand
with
his
teeth
and
with
one
bite
bit
it
clear
off
and
spat
it
out
imagine
his
astonishment
when
instead
of
a
hand
he
perceived
that
a
cat
paw
lay
on
the
ground
encouraged
by
this
first
victory
he
used
his
nails
to
such
purpose
that
he
succeeded
in
liberating
himself
from
his
assailants
and
jumping
the
hedge
by
the
roadside
he
began
to
fly
across
the
country
the
assassins
ran
after
him
like
two
dogs
chasing
a
hare
and
the
one
who
had
lost
a
paw
ran
on
one
leg
and
no
one
ever
knew
how
he
managed
it
after
a
race
of
some
miles
pinocchio
could
go
no
more
giving
himself
up
for
lost
he
climbed
the
trunk
of
a
very
high
pine
tree
and
seated
himself
in
the
topmost
branches
the
assassins
attempted
to
climb
after
him
but
when
they
had
reached
up
they
slid
down
again
and
arrived
on
the
ground
with
the
skin
grazed
from
their
hands
and
knees
but
they
were
not
to
be
beaten
by
so
little
collecting
a
quantity
of
dry
wood
they
piled
it
beneath
the
pine
and
set
fire
to
it
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
the
pine
began
to
burn
and
to
flame
like
a
candle
blown
by
the
wind
pinocchio
seeing
that
the
flames
were
mounting
higher
every
instant
and
not
wishing
to
end
his
life
like
a
roasted
pigeon
made
a
stupendous
leap
from
the
top
of
the
tree
and
started
afresh
across
the
fields
and
vineyards
the
assassins
followed
him
and
kept
behind
him
without
once
giving
up
the
day
began
to
break
and
they
were
still
pursuing
him
suddenly
pinocchio
found
his
way
barred
by
a
wide
deep
ditch
full
of
stagnant
water
the
color
of
coffee
what
was
he
to
do
one
two
three
cried
the
puppet
and
making
a
rush
he
sprang
to
the
other
side
the
assassins
also
jumped
but
not
having
measured
the
distance
properly
splash
splash
they
fell
into
the
very
middle
of
the
ditch
pinocchio
who
heard
the
plunge
and
the
splashing
of
the
water
shouted
out
laughing
and
without
stopping
a
fine
bath
to
you
gentleman
assassins
and
he
felt
convinced
that
they
were
drowned
when
turning
to
look
he
perceived
that
on
the
contrary
they
were
both
running
after
him
still
enveloped
in
their
sacks
with
the
water
dripping
from
them
as
if
they
had
been
two
hollow
baskets

the
assassins
hang
pinocchio
to
the
big
oak
at
this
sight
the
puppet
courage
failed
him
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
himself
on
the
ground
and
giving
himself
over
for
lost
turning
however
his
eyes
in
every
direction
he
saw
at
some
distance
a
small
house
as
white
as
snow
if
only
i
had
breath
to
reach
that
house
he
said
to
himself
perhaps
i
should
be
saved
and
without
delaying
an
instant
he
recommenced
running
for
his
life
through
the
wood
and
the
assassins
after
him
at
last
after
a
desperate
race
of
nearly
two
hours
he
arrived
quite
breathless
at
the
door
of
the
house
and
knocked
no
one
answered
he
knocked
again
with
great
violence
for
he
heard
the
sound
of
steps
approaching
him
and
the
heavy
panting
of
his
persecutors
the
same
silence
seeing
that
knocking
was
useless
he
began
in
desperation
to
kick
and
pommel
the
door
with
all
his
might
the
window
then
opened
and
a
beautiful
child
appeared
at
it
she
had
blue
hair
and
a
face
as
white
as
a
waxen
image
her
eyes
were
closed
and
her
hands
were
crossed
on
her
breast
without
moving
her
lips
in
the
least
she
said
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
other
world
in
this
house
there
is
no
one
they
are
all
dead
then
at
least
open
the
door
for
me
yourself
shouted
pinocchio
crying
and
imploring
i
am
dead
also
dead
then
what
are
you
doing
there
at
the
window
i
am
waiting
for
the
bier
to
come
to
carry
me
away
having
said
this
she
immediately
disappeared
and
the
window
was
closed
again
without
the
slightest
noise
oh
beautiful
child
with
blue
hair
cried
pinocchio
open
the
door
for
pity
sake
have
compassion
on
a
poor
boy
pursued
by
assas
but
he
could
not
finish
the
word
for
he
felt
himself
seized
by
the
collar
and
the
same
two
horrible
voices
said
to
him
threateningly
you
shall
not
escape
from
us
again
the
puppet
seeing
death
staring
him
in
the
face
was
taken
with
such
a
violent
fit
of
trembling
that
the
joints
of
his
wooden
legs
began
to
creak
and
the
sovereigns
hidden
under
his
tongue
to
clink
now
then
demanded
the
assassins
will
you
open
your
mouth
yes
or
no
ah
no
answer
leave
it
to
us
this
time
we
will
force
you
to
open
it
and
drawing
out
two
long
horrid
knives
as
sharp
as
razors
clash
they
attempted
to
stab
him
twice
but
the
puppet
luckily
for
him
was
made
of
very
hard
wood
the
knives
therefore
broke
into
a
thousand
pieces
and
the
assassins
were
left
with
the
handles
in
their
hands
staring
at
each
other
i
see
what
we
must
do
said
one
of
them
he
must
be
hung
let
us
hang
him
let
us
hang
him
repeated
the
other
without
loss
of
time
they
tied
his
arms
behind
him
passed
a
running
noose
round
his
throat
and
hung
him
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
called
the
big
oak
they
then
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
waited
for
his
last
struggle
but
at
the
end
of
three
hours
the
puppet
eyes
were
still
open
his
mouth
closed
and
he
was
kicking
more
than
ever
losing
patience
they
turned
to
pinocchio
and
said
in
a
bantering
tone
till
tomorrow
let
us
hope
that
when
we
return
you
will
be
polite
enough
to
allow
yourself
to
be
found
quite
dead
and
with
your
mouth
wide
open
and
they
walked
off
in
the
meantime
a
tempestuous
northerly
wind
began
to
blow
and
roar
angrily
and
it
beat
the
poor
puppet
from
side
to
side
making
him
swing
violently
like
the
clatter
of
a
bell
ringing
for
a
wedding
and
the
swinging
gave
him
atrocious
spasms
and
the
running
noose
becoming
still
tighter
round
his
throat
took
away
his
breath
little
by
little
his
eyes
began
to
grow
dim
but
although
he
felt
that
death
was
near
he
still
continued
to
hope
that
some
charitable
person
would
come
to
his
assistance
before
it
was
too
late
but
when
after
waiting
and
waiting
he
found
that
no
one
came
absolutely
no
one
then
he
remembered
his
poor
father
and
thinking
he
was
dying
he
stammered
out
oh
papa
papa
if
only
you
were
here

the
beautiful
child
rescues
the
puppet
while
poor
pinocchio
suspended
to
a
branch
of
the
big
oak
was
apparently
more
dead
than
alive
the
beautiful
child
with
blue
hair
came
again
to
the
window
when
she
saw
the
unhappy
puppet
hanging
by
his
throat
and
dancing
up
and
down
in
the
gusts
of
the
north
wind
she
was
moved
by
compassion
striking
her
hands
together
she
gave
three
little
claps
at
this
signal
there
came
a
sound
of
the
sweep
of
wings
flying
rapidly
and
a
large
falcon
flew
on
to
the
what
are
your
orders
gracious
fairy
he
asked
inclining
his
beak
in
sign
of
reverence
do
you
see
that
puppet
dangling
from
a
branch
of
the
big
oak
i
see
him
very
well
fly
there
at
once
with
your
strong
beak
break
the
knot
that
keeps
him
suspended
in
the
air
and
lay
him
gently
on
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
the
falcon
flew
away
and
after
two
minutes
he
returned
saying
i
have
done
as
you
commanded
and
how
did
you
find
him
to
see
him
he
appeared
dead
but
he
can
not
really
be
quite
dead
for
i
had
no
sooner
loosened
the
running
noose
that
tightened
his
throat
than
giving
a
sigh
he
muttered
in
a
faint
voice
i
feel
better
the
fairy
then
struck
her
hands
together
twice
and
a
magnificent
poodle
appeared
walking
upright
on
his
hind
legs
exactly
as
if
he
had
been
a
man
he
was
in
the
livery
of
a
coachman
on
his
head
he
had
a
cap
braided
with
gold
his
curly
white
wig
came
down
on
to
his
shoulders
he
had
a
waistcoat
with
diamond
buttons
and
two
large
pockets
to
contain
the
bones
that
his
mistress
gave
him
at
dinner
he
had
besides
a
pair
of
short
crimson
velvet
breeches
silk
stockings
shoes
and
hanging
behind
him
a
species
of
umbrella
case
made

and
take
the
road
to
the
wood
when
you
come
to
the

oak
you
will
find
a
poor
puppet
stretched
on
the
grass
half
dead

him
up
gently
and
lay
him
flat
on
the
cushions
of
the
carriage
and
bring
him
here

me

you

shook
the
case
of
blue
satin
three
or
four
times
and
ran
off
like
a
shortly
afterwards
a
beautiful
little
carriage
came
out
of

cushions
were
stuffed
with
canary
feathers
and
it
was
lined
on
the
inside
with
whipped
cream
custard
and
vanilla
wafers
the
little
carriage
was
drawn
by
a
hundred
pairs
of
white
mice
and
the
poodle
seated
on
the
cracked
his
whip
from
side
to
side
like
a
driver
when
he
is
afraid
that
he
is
behind

scarcely
had
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
when
the
carriage
returned
the
fairy
who
was
waiting
at
the
door
of
the
house
took
the
poor
puppet
in
her
arms
and
carried
him
into
a
little
room
that
was
wainscoted
with
she
sent
at
once
to
summon
the
most
famous
doctors
in
the
neighborhood
they
came
immediately
one
after
the
other
namely
a
crow
an
owl
and
a
i
wish
to
know
from
you
gentlemen
said
the
fairy
if
this
unfortunate
puppet
is
alive
or
dead
at
this
request
the
crow
advancing
first
felt
pinocchio
pulse
he
then
felt
his
nose
and
then
the
little
toe
of
his
foot
and
having
done
this
carefully
he
pronounced
solemnly
the
following
words
to
my
belief
the
puppet
is
already
quite
dead
but
if
unfortunately
he
should
not
be
dead
then
it
would
be
a
sign
that
he
is
still
alive
i
regret
said
the
owl
to
be
obliged
to
contradict
the
crow
my
illustrious
friend
and
colleague
but
in
my
opinion
the
puppet
is
still
alive
but
if
unfortunately
he
should
not
be
alive
then
it
would
be
a
sign
that
he
is
dead
indeed
and
you
have
you
nothing
to
say
asked
the
fairy
of
the
in
my
opinion
the
wisest
thing
a
prudent
doctor
can
do
when
he
does
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
is
to
be
silent
for
the
rest

has

is
not

have
known

who
up
to

had

that

pinocchio
will
not
take
his
medicine
as
soon
as
the
three
doctors
had
left
the
room
the
fairy
approached
pinocchio
and
having
touched
his
forehead
she
perceived
that
he
was
in

high
fever
she
therefore
dissolved
a

white
powder
in

a

looked
at

tumbler
made
a

face
and
then
asked
in

plaintive
voice

the
sugar
and
pinocchio
having
crunched
it
up
and
swallowed
it
in
a
second
said
licking
his
lips
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
if
sugar
were
medicine
i
would
take
it
every
day
now
keep
your
promise
and
drink
these
few
drops
of
water
which
will
restore
you
to
health
pinocchio
took
the
tumbler
unwillingly
in
his
hand
and
put
the
point
of
his
nose
to
it
he
then
approached
it
to
his
lips
he
then
again
put
his
nose
to
it
and
at
last
said
it
is
too
bitter
too
bitter
i
can
not
drink
it
how
can
you
tell
that
when
you
have
not
even
tasted
it
i
can
imagine
it
i
know
it
from
the
smell
i
want
first
another
lump
of
sugar
and
then
i
will
drink
it
the
fairy
then
with
all
the
patience
of
a
good
mamma
put
another
lump
of
sugar
in
his
mouth
and
again
presented
the
tumbler
to
him
i
can
not
drink
it
so
said
the
puppet
making
a
thousand
grimaces
why
because
that
pillow
that
is
down
there
on
my
feet
bothers
me
the
fairy
removed
the
pillow
it
is
useless
even
so
i
can
not
drink
it
what
is
the
matter
now
the
door
of
the
room
which
is
half
open
bothers
me
the
fairy
went
and
closed
the
door
in
short
cried
pinocchio
bursting
into
tears
i
will
not
drink
that
bitter
water
no
no
no
my
boy
you
will
repent
it
i
do
care
your
illness
is
serious
i
do
care
the
fever
in
a
few
hours
will
carry
you
into
the
other
world
i
do
care
are
you
not
afraid
of
death
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
i
would
rather
die
than
drink
that
bitter
medicine
at
that
moment
the
door
of
the
room
flew
open
and
four
rabbits
as
black
as
ink
entered
carrying
on
their
shoulders
a
little
bier
what
do
you
want
with
me
cried
pinocchio
sitting
up
in
bed
in
a
great
fright
we
have
come
to
take
you
said
the
biggest
rabbit
to
take
me
but
i
am
not
yet
dead
no
not
yet
but
you
have
only
a
few
minutes
to
live
as
you
have
refused
the
medicine
that
would
have
cured
you
of
the
fever
oh
fairy
fairy
the
puppet
then
began
to
scream
give
me
the
tumbler
at
once
be
quick
for
pity
sake
for
i
will
not
die
no
i
will
not
die
and
taking
the
tumbler
in
both
hands
he
emptied
it
at
a
gulp
we
must
have
patience
said
the
rabbits
this
time
we
have
made
our
journey
in
vain
and
taking
the
little
bier
again
on
their
shoulders
they
left
the
room
grumbling
and
murmuring
between
their
teeth
in
fact
a
few
minutes
afterwards
pinocchio
jumped
down
from
the
bed
quite
well
because
wooden
puppets
have
the
privilege
of
being
seldom
ill
and
of
being
cured
very
quickly
the
fairy
seeing
him
running
and
rushing
about
the
room
as
gay
and
as
lively
as
a
young
cock
said
to
him
then
my
medicine
has
really
done
you
good
good
i
should
think
so
it
has
restored
me
to
life
then
why
on
earth
did
you
require
so
much
persuasion
to
take
it
because
you
see
that
we
boys
are
all
like
that
we
are
more
afraid
of
medicine
than
of
the
illness
disgraceful
boys
ought
to
know
that
a
good
remedy
taken
in
time
may
save
them
from
a
serious
illness
and
perhaps
even
from
death
oh
but
another
time
i
shall
not
require
so
much
persuasion
i
shall
remember
those
black
rabbits
with
the
bier
on
their
shoulders
and
then
i
shall
immediately
take
the
tumbler
in
my
hand
and
down
it
will
go
now
come
here
to
me
and
tell
me
how
it
came
about
that
you
fell
into
the
hands
of
those
assassins
you
see
the
showman
gave
me
some
gold
pieces
and
said
to
me
and
take
them
to
your
father
and
instead
i
met
on
the
road
a
fox
and
a
cat
who
said
to
me
you
like
those
pieces
of
gold
to
become
a
thousand
or
two
come
with
us
and
we
will
take
you
to
the
field
of
miracles
and
i
said
us
go
and
they
said
us
stop
at
the
inn
of
the
red
and
after
midnight
they
left
and
when
i
awoke
i
found
that
they
were
no
longer
there
because
they
had
gone
away
then
i
began
to
travel
by
night
for
you
can
not
imagine
how
dark
it
was
and
on
that
account
i
met
on
the
road
two
assassins
in
charcoal
sacks
who
said
to
me
with
your
money
and
i
said
to
them
have
got
none
because
i
had
hidden
the
four
gold
pieces
in
my
mouth
and
one
of
the
assassins
tried
to
put
his
hand
in
my
mouth
and
i
bit
his
hand
off
and
spat
it
out
but
instead
of
a
hand
it
was
a
cat
paw
and
the
assassins
ran
after
me
and
i
ran
and
ran
until
at
last
they
caught
me
and
tied
me
by
the
neck
to
a
tree
in
this
wood
and
said
to
me
we
shall
return
here
and
then
you
will
be
dead
with
your
mouth
open
and
we
shall
be
able
to
carry
off
the
pieces
of
gold
that
you
have
hidden
under
your
tongue
and
the
four
pieces
where
have
you
put
them
asked
the
fairy
i
have
lost
them
said
pinocchio
but
he
was
telling
a
lie
for
he
had
them
in
his
pocket
he
had
scarcely
told
the
lie
when
his
nose
which
was
already
long
grew
at
once
two
inches
longer
and
where
did
you
lose
them
in
the
wood
near
here
at
this
second
lie
his
nose
went
on
growing
if
you
have
lost
them
in
the
wood
near
here
said
the
fairy
we
will
look
for
them
and
we
shall
find
them
because
everything
that
is
lost
in
that
wood
is
always
found
ah
now
i
remember
all
about
it
replied
the
puppet
getting
quite
confused
i
did
lose
the
four
gold
pieces
i
swallowed
them
whilst
i
was
drinking
your
medicine
at
this
lie
his
nose
grew
to
such
an
extraordinary
length
that
poor
pinocchio
could
not
move
in
any
direction
if
he
turned
to
one
side
he
struck
his
nose
against
the
bed
or
the
if
he
turned
to
the
other
he
struck
it
against
the
walls
or
the
door
if
he
raised
his
head
a
little
he
ran
the
risk
of
sticking
it
into
one
of
the
fairy
eyes
and
the
fairy
looked
at
him
and
laughed
what
are
you
laughing
at
asked
the
puppet
very
confused
and
anxious
at
finding
his
nose
growing
so
prodigiously
i
am
laughing
at
the
lie
you
have
told
and
how
can
you
possibly
know
that
i
have
told
a
lie
lies
my
dear
boy
are
found
out
immediately
because
they
are
of
two
sorts
there
are
lies
that
have
short
legs
and
lies
that
have
long
noses
your
lie
as
it
happens
is
one
of
those
that
have
a
long
nose
pinocchio
not
knowing
where
to
hide
himself
for
shame
tried
to
run
out
of
the
room
but
he
did
not
succeed
for
his
nose
had
increased
so
much
that
it
could
no
longer
pass
through
the
door

splash
they
fell
into

middle

pinocchio
again
meets
the
fox
and
the
cat
the
fairy
allowed
the
puppet
to
cry
for
a
good
over
his
nose
which
could
no
longer
pass
through
the
door
of
the
room
this
she
did
to
give
him
a
severe
lesson
and
to
correct
him
of
the
disgraceful
fault
of
telling
lies
the
most
disgraceful
fault
that
a
boy
can
have
but
when
she
saw
him
quite
disfigured
and
his
eyes
swollen
out
of
his
head
from
weeping
she
felt
full
of
compassion
for
him
she
therefore
beat
her
hands
together
and
at
that
signal
a
thousand
large
birds
called
woodpeckers
flew
in
at
the
window
they
immediately
perched
on
pinocchio
nose
and
began
to
peck
at
it
with
such
zeal
that
in
a
few
minutes
his
enormous
and
ridiculous
nose
was
reduced
to
its
usual
dimensions
what
a
good
fairy
you
are
said
the
puppet
drying
his
eyes
and
how
much
i
love
you
i
love
you
also
answered
the
fairy
and
if
you
will
remain
with
me
you
shall
be
my
little
brother
and
i
will
be
your
good
little
sister
i
would
remain
willingly
if
it
were
not
for
my
poor
papa
i
have
thought
of
everything
i
have
already
let
your
father
know
and
he
will
be
here
tonight
really
shouted
pinocchio
jumping
for
joy
then
little
fairy
if
you
consent
i
should
like
to
go
and
meet
him
i
am
so
anxious
to
give
a
kiss
to
that
poor
old
man
who
has
suffered
so
much
on
my
account
that
i
am
counting
the
minutes
go
then
but
be
careful
not
to
lose
yourself
take
the
road
through
the
wood
and
i
am
sure
that
you
will
meet
him
pinocchio
set
out
and
as
soon
as
he
was
in
the
wood
he
began
to
run
like
a
kid
but
when
he
had
reached
a
certain
spot
almost
in
front
of
the
big
oak
he
stopped
because
he
thought
he
heard
people
amongst
the
bushes
in
fact
two
persons
came
out
on
to
the
road
can
you
guess
who
they
were
his
two
traveling
companions
the
fox
and
the
cat
with
whom
he
had
supped
at
the
inn
of
the
red
why
here
is
our
dear
pinocchio
cried
the
fox
kissing
and
embracing
him
how
came
you
to
be
here
how
come
you
to
be
here
repeated
the
cat
it
is
a
long
story
answered
the
puppet
which
i
will
tell
you
when
i
have
time
but
do
you
know
that
the
other
night
when
you
left
me
alone
at
the
inn
i
met
with
assassins
on
the
road
assassins
oh
poor
pinocchio
and
what
did
they
want
they
wanted
to
rob
me
of
my
gold
pieces
villains
said
the
fox
infamous
villains
repeated
the
cat
but
i
ran
away
from
them
continued
the
puppet
and
they
followed
me
and
at
last
they
overtook
me
and
hung
me
to
a
branch
of
that
oak
tree
and
pinocchio
pointed
to
the
big
oak
which
was
two
steps
from
them
is
it
possible
to
hear
of
anything
more
dreadful
said
the
fox
in
what
a
world
we
are
condemned
to
live
where
can
respectable
people
like
us
find
a
safe
refuge
whilst
they
were
thus
talking
pinocchio
observed
that
the
cat
was
lame
of
her
front
right
leg
for
in
fact
she
had
lost
her
paw
with
all
its
claws
he
therefore
asked
her
what
have
you
done
with
your
paw
the
cat
tried
to
answer
but
became
confused
therefore
the
fox
said
immediately
my
friend
is
too
modest
and
that
is
why
she
does
speak
i
will
answer
for
her
i
must
tell
you
that
an
hour
ago
we
met
an
old
wolf
on
the
road
almost
fainting
from
want
of
food
who
asked
alms
of
us
not
having
so
much
as
a
to
give
him
what
did
my
friend
who
has
really
the
heart
of
a
cæsar
do
she
bit
off
one
of
her
fore
paws
and
threw
it
to
that
poor
beast
that
he
might
appease
his
hunger
and
the
fox
in
relating
this
dried
a
tear
pinocchio
was
also
touched
and
approaching
the
cat
he
whispered
into
her
ear
if
all
cats
resembled
you
how
fortunate
the
mice
would
be
and
now
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
the
fox
of
the
puppet
i
am
waiting
for
my
papa
whom
i
expect
to
arrive
every
moment
and
your
gold
pieces
i
have
got
them
in
my
pocket
all
but
one
that
i
spent
at
the
inn
of
the
red
and
to
think
that
instead
of
four
pieces
by
tomorrow
they
might
become
one
or
two
thousand
why
do
you
not
listen
to
my
advice
why
will
you
not
go
and
bury
them
in
the
field
of
miracles
today
it
is
impossible
i
will
go
another
day
another
day
it
will
be
too
late
said
the
fox
why
because
the
field
has
been
bought
by
a
gentleman
and
after
tomorrow
no
one
will
be
allowed
to
bury
money
there
how
far
off
is
the
field
of
miracles
not
two
miles
will
you
come
with
us
in
half
an
hour
you
will
be
there
you
can
bury
your
money
at
once
and
in
a
few
minutes
you
will
collect
two
thousand
and
this
evening
you
will
return
with
your
pockets
full
will
you
come
with
us
pinocchio
thought
of
the
good
fairy
old
geppetto
and
the
warnings
of
the
and
he
hesitated
a
little
before
answering
he
ended
however
by
doing
as
all
boys
do
who
have
not
a
grain
of
sense
and
who
have
no
heart
he
ended
by
giving
his
head
a
little
shake
and
saying
to
the
fox
and
the
cat
let
us
go
i
will
come
with
you
and
they
went
after
having
walked
half
the
day
they
reached
a
town
that
was
called
trap
for
blockheads
as
soon
as
pinocchio
entered
this
town
he
saw
that
the
streets
were
crowded
with
dogs
who
were
yawning
from
hunger
shorn
sheep
trembling
with
cold
cocks
without
combs
begging
for
a
grain
of
indian
corn
large
butterflies
that
could
no
longer
fly
because
they
had
sold
their
beautiful
colored
wings
peacocks
which
had
no
tails
and
were
ashamed
to
be
seen
and
pheasants
that
went
scratching
about
in
a
subdued
fashion
mourning
for
their
brilliant
gold
and
silver
feathers
gone
forever
in
the
midst
of
this
crowd
of
beggars
and
shamefaced
creatures
some
lordly
carriage
passed
from
time
to
time
containing
a
fox
or
a
thieving
magpie
or
some
other
ravenous
bird
of
prey
and
where
is
the
field
of
miracles
asked
pinocchio
it
is
here
not
two
steps
from
us
they
crossed
the
town
and
having
gone
beyond
the
walls
they
came
to
a
solitary
field
here
we
are
said
the
fox
to
the
puppet
now
stoop
down
and
dig
with
your
hands
a
little
hole
in
the
ground
and
put
your
gold
pieces
into
it
pinocchio
obeyed
he
dug
a
hole
put
into
it
the
four
gold
pieces
that
he
had
left
and
then
filled
up
the
hole
with
a
little
earth
now
then
said
the
fox
go
to
that
canal
close
to
us
fetch
a
can
of
water
and
water
the
ground
where
you
have
sowed
them
pinocchio
went
to
the
canal
and
as
he
had
no
can
he
took
off
one
of
his
old
shoes
and
filling
it
with
water
he
watered
the
ground
over
the
hole
he
then
asked
is
there
anything
else
to
be
done
nothing
else
answered
the
fox
we
can
now
go
away
you
can
return
in
about
twenty
minutes
and
you
will
find
a
shrub
already
pushing
through
the
ground
with
its
branches
quite
loaded
with
money
the
poor
puppet
beside
himself
with
joy
thanked
the
fox
and
the
cat
a
thousand
times
and
promised
them
a
beautiful
present
we
wish
for
no
presents
answered
the
two
rascals
it
is
enough
for
us
to
have
taught
you
the
way
to
enrich
yourself
without
undergoing
hard
work
and
we
are
as
happy
as
people
out
for
a
holiday
thus
saying
they
took
leave
of
pinocchio
and
wishing
him
a
good
harvest
went
about
their
business

of

the
puppet
returned
to
the
town
and
began
to
count
the
minutes
one
by
one
and
when
he
thought
that
it
must
be
time
he
took
the
road
leading
to
the
field

as
he
walked
along
with
hurried
steps
his
heart
beat
fast

pieces
i
were
to
find
on

that
i
found
a
hundred
thousand
oh
what
a
fine
gentleman
i
should
then
become
i
would
have
a
beautiful
palace
a
thousand
little
wooden
horses
and
a
thousand
stables
to
amuse
myself
with
a
cellar
full
of
currant
wine
and
sweet
syrups
and
a
library
quite
full
of
candies
tarts
macaroons
and
biscuits
with
cream
whilst
he
was
building
these
castles
in
the
air
he
had
arrived
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
field
and
he
stopped
to
look
about
for
a
tree
with
its
branches
laden
with
money
but
he
saw
nothing
he
advanced
another
hundred
steps
nothing
he
entered
the
field
and
went
right
up
to
the
little
hole
where
he
had
buried
his
sovereigns
and
nothing
he
then
became
very
thoughtful
and
forgetting
the
rules
of
society
and
good
manners
he
took
his
hands
out
of
his
pocket
and
gave
his
head
a
long
scratch
at
that
moment
he
heard
an
explosion
of
laughter
close
to
him
and
looking
up
he
saw
a
large
parrot
perched
on
a
tree
who
was
pruning
the
few
feathers
he
had
left
why
are
you
laughing
asked
pinocchio
in
an
angry
voice
i
am
laughing
because
in
pruning
my
feathers
i
tickled
myself
under
my
wings
the
puppet
did
not
answer
but
went
to
the
canal
and
filling
the
same
old
shoe
full
of
water
he
proceeded
to
water
the
earth
afresh
that
covered
his
gold
pieces
while
he
was
thus
occupied
another
laugh
still
more
impertinent
than
the
first
rang
out
in
the
silence
of
that
solitary
place
once
for
all
shouted
pinocchio
in
a
rage
may
i
know
you
parrot
what
you
are
laughing
at
i
am
laughing
at
those
simpletons
who
believe
in
all
the
foolish
things
that
are
told
them
and
who
allow
themselves
to
be
entrapped
by
those
who
are
more
cunning
than
they
are
are
you
perhaps
speaking
of
me
yes
i
am
speaking
of
you
poor
pinocchio
of
you
who
are
simple
enough
to
believe
that
money
can
be
sown
and
gathered
in
fields
in
the
same
way
as
beans
and
gourds
i
also
believed
it
once
and
today
i
am
suffering
for
it
today
but
it
is
too
late
i
have
at
last
learned
that
to
put
a
few
pennies
honestly
together
it
is
necessary
to
know
how
to
earn
them
either
by
the
work
of
our
own
hands
or
by
the
cleverness
of
our
own
brains
i
do
understand
you
said
the
puppet
who
was
already
trembling
with
fear
have
patience
i
will
explain
myself
better
rejoined
the
parrot
you
must
know
then
that
while
you
were
in
the
town
the
fox
and
the
cat
returned
to
the
field
they
took
the
buried
money
and
then
fled
like
the
wind
and
now
he
that
catches
them
will
be
clever
pinocchio
remained
with
his
mouth
open
and
not
choosing
to
believe
the
parrot
words
he
began
with
his
hands
and
nails
to
dig
up
the
earth
that
he
had
watered
and
he
dug
and
dug
and
dug
and
made
such
a
deep
hole
that
a
rick
of
straw
might
have
stood
upright
in
it
but
the
money
was
no
longer
there
he
rushed
back
to
the
town
in
a
state
of
desperation
and
went
at
once
to
the
courts
of
justice
to
denounce
the
two
knaves
who
had
robbed
him
to
the
judge
the
judge
was
a
big
ape
of
the
gorilla
tribe
an
old
ape
respectable
for
his
age
his
white
beard
but
especially
for
his
gold
spectacles
without
glasses
that
he
was
always
obliged
to
wear
on
account
of
an
inflammation
of
the
eyes
that
had
tormented
him
for
many
years
pinocchio
related
in
the
presence
of
the
judge
all
the
particulars
of
the
infamous
fraud
of
which
he
had
been
the
victim
he
gave
the
names
the
surnames
and
other
details
of
the
two
rascals
and
ended
by
demanding
justice
the
judge
listened
with
great
benignity
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
story
was
much
touched
and
moved
and
when
the
puppet
had
nothing
further
to
say
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
rang
a
bell
at
this
summons
two
mastiffs
immediately
appeared
dressed
as
gendarmes
the
judge
then
pointing
to
pinocchio
said
to
them
that
poor
devil
has
been
robbed
of
four
gold
pieces
take
him
away
and
put
him
immediately
into
prison
the
puppet
was
petrified
on
hearing
this
unexpected
sentence
and
tried
to
protest
but
the
gendarmes
to
avoid
losing
time
stopped
his
mouth
and
carried
him
off
to
the
lockup
and
there
he
remained
for
four
months
four
long
months
and
he
would
have
remained
longer
still
if
a
fortunate
chance
had
not
released
him
the
young
emperor
who
reigned
over
the
town
of
trap
for
blockheads
having
won
a
splendid
victory
over
his
enemies
ordered
great
public
rejoicings
there
were
illuminations
fireworks
horse
races
and
velocipede
races
and
as
a
further
sign
of
triumph
he
commanded
that
the
prisons
should
be
opened
and
all
the
prisoners
freed
if
the
others
are
to
be
let
out
of
prison
i
will
go
also
said
pinocchio
to
the
jailor
no
not
you
said
the
jailor
because
you
do
not
belong
to
the
fortunate
class
i
beg
your
pardon
replied
pinocchio
i
am
also
a
criminal
in
that
case
you
are
perfectly
right
said
the
jailor
and
taking
off
his
hat
and
bowing
to
him
respectfully
he
opened
the
prison
doors
and
let
him
escape

pinocchio
starts
back
to
the
fairy
house
you
can
imagine
pinocchio
joy
when
he
found
himself
free
without
stopping
to
take
breath
he
immediately
left
the
town
and
took
the
road
that
led
to
the
fairy
house
on
account
of
the
rainy
weather
the
road
had
become
a
marsh
into
which
he
sank
but
the
puppet
would
not
give
in
tormented
by
the
desire
of
seeing
his
father
and
his
little
sister
with
blue
hair
again
he
ran
on
like
a
greyhound
and
as
he
ran
he
was
splashed
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
and
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
along
how
many
misfortunes
have
happened
to
me
but
i
deserved
them
for
i
am
an
obstinate
passionate
puppet
i
am
always
bent
upon
having
my
own
way
without
listening
to
those
who
wish
me
well
and
who
have
a
thousand
times
more
sense
than
i
have
but
from
this
time
forth
i
am
determined
to
change
and
to
become
orderly
and
obedient
for
at
last
i
have
seen
that
disobedient
boys
come
to
no
good
and
gain
nothing
and
has
my
papa
waited
for
me
shall
i
find
him
at
the
fairy
house
poor
man
it
is
so
long
since
i
last
saw
him
i
am
dying
to
embrace
him
and
to
cover
him
with
kisses
and
will
the
fairy
forgive
me
my
bad
conduct
to
her
to
think
of
all
the
kindness
and
loving
care
i
received
from
her
to
think
that
if
i
am
now
alive
i
owe
it
to
her
would
it
be
possible
to
find
a
more
ungrateful
boy
or
one
with
less
heart
than
i
have
whilst
he
was
saying
this
he
stopped
suddenly
frightened
to
death
and
made
four
steps
backwards
what
had
he
seen
he
had
seen
an
immense
serpent
stretched
across
the
road
its
skin
was
green
it
had
red
eyes
and
a
pointed
tail
that
was
smoking
like
a
chimney
it
would
be
impossible
to
imagine
the
puppet
terror
he
walked
away
to
a
safe
distance
and
sitting
down
on
a
heap
of
stones
waited
until
the
serpent
should
have
gone
about
its
business
and
left
the
road
clear
he
waited
an
hour
two
hours
three
hours
but
the
serpent
was
always
there
and
even
from
a
distance
he
could
see
the
red
light
of
his
fiery
eyes
and
the
column
of
smoke
that
ascended
from
the
end
of
his
tail
at
last
pinocchio
trying
to
feel
courageous
approached
to
within
a
few
steps
and
said
to
the
serpent
in
a
little
soft
insinuating
voice
excuse
me
sir
serpent
but
would
you
be
so
good
as
to
move
a
little
to
one
side
just
enough
to
allow
me
to
pass
he
might
as
well
have
spoken
to
the
wall
nobody
moved
he
began
again
in
the
same
soft
voice
you
must
know
sir
serpent
that
i
am
on
my
way
home
where
my
father
is
waiting
for
me
and
it
is
such
a
long
time
since
i
saw
him
last
will
you
therefore
allow
me
to
continue
my
road
he
waited
for
a
sign
in
answer
to
this
request
but
there
was
none
in
fact
the
serpent
who
up
to
that
moment
had
been
sprightly
and
full
of
life
became
motionless
and
almost
rigid
he
shut
his
eyes
and
his
tail
ceased
smoking
can
he
really
be
dead
said
pinocchio
rubbing
his
hands
with
delight
he
determined
to
jump
over
him
and
reach
the
other
side
of
the
road
but
just
as
he
was
going
to
leap
the
serpent
raised
himself
suddenly
on
end
like
a
spring
set
in
motion
and
the
puppet
drawing
back
in
his
terror
caught
his
feet
and
fell
to
the
ground
and
he
fell
so
awkwardly
that
his
head
stuck
in
the
mud
and
his
legs
went
into
the
air
at
the
sight
of
the
puppet
kicking
violently
with
his
head
in
the
mud
the
serpent
went
into
convulsions
of
laughter
and
laughed
and
laughed
until
he
broke
a
in
his
chest
and
died
and
that
time
he
was
really
dead
pinocchio
then
set
off
running
in
hopes
that
he
should
reach
the
fairy
house
before
dark
but
before
long
he
began
to
suffer
so
dreadfully
from
hunger
that
he
could
not
bear
it
and
he
jumped
into
a
field
by
the
wayside
intending
to
pick
some
bunches
of
muscatel
grapes
oh
that
he
had
never
done
it
he
had
scarcely
reached
the
vines
when
crack
his
legs
were
caught
between
two
cutting
iron
bars
and
he
became
so
giddy
with
pain
that
stars
of
every
color
danced
before
his
eyes
the
poor
puppet
had
been
taken
in
a
trap
put
there
to
capture
some
big
polecats
which
were
the
scourge
of
the
in
the
neighborhood

acts
as
pinocchio
began
to
cry
and
scream
but
his
tears
and
groans
were
useless
for
there
was
not
a
house
to
be
seen
and
not
a
living
soul
passed
down
the
road
at
last
night
came
on
partly
from
the
pain
of
the
trap
that
cut
his
legs
and
a
little
from
fear
at
finding
himself
alone
in
the
dark
in
the
midst
of
the
fields
the
puppet
was
on
the
point
of
fainting
just
at
that
moment
he
saw
a
firefly
flitting
over
his
head
he
called
to
it
and
said
oh
little
firefly
will
you
have
pity
on
me
and
liberate
me
from
this
torture
poor
boy
said
the
firefly
stopping
and
looking
at
him
with
compassion
but
how
could
your
legs
have
been
caught
by
those
sharp
irons
i
came
into
the
field
to
pick
two
bunches
of
these
muscatel
grapes
and
but
were
the
grapes
yours
no
then
who
taught
you
to
carry
off
other
people
property
i
was
so
hungry
hunger
my
boy
is
not
a
good
reason
for
appropriating
what
does
not
belong
to
us
that
is
true
that
is
true
said
pinocchio
crying
i
will
never
do
it
again
at
this
moment
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
slight
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
it
was
the
owner
of
the
field
coming
on
tiptoe
to
see
if
one
of
the
polecats
that
ate
his
chickens
during
the
night
had
been
caught
in
his
trap
his
astonishment
was
great
when
having
brought
out
his
lantern
from
under
his
coat
he
perceived
that
instead
of
a
polecat
a
boy
had
been
taken
ah
little
thief
said
the
angry
peasant
then
it
is
you
who
carries
off
my
chickens
no
it
is
not
i
indeed
it
is
not
cried
pinocchio
sobbing
i
only
came
into
the
field
to
take
two
bunches
of
grapes
he
who
steals
grapes
is
quite
capable
of
stealing
chickens
leave
it
to
me
i
will
give
you
a
lesson
that
you
will
not
forget
in
a
hurry
opening
the
trap
he
seized
the
puppet
by
the
collar
and
carried
him
to
his
house
as
if
he
had
been
a
young
lamb
when
he
reached
the
yard
in
front
of
the
house
he
threw
him
roughly
on
the
ground
and
putting
his
foot
on
his
neck
he
said
to
him
it
is
late
and
i
want
to
go
to
bed
we
will
settle
our
accounts
tomorrow
in
the
meanwhile
as
the
dog
who
kept
guard
at
night
died
today
you
shall
take
his
place
at
once
you
shall
be
my
and
taking
a
great
collar
covered
with
brass
knobs
he
strapped
it
so
tightly
round
his
throat
that
he
was
not
able
to
draw
his
head
out
of
it
a
heavy
chain
attached
to
the
collar
was
fastened
to
the
wall
if
it
should
rain
tonight
he
then
said
to
him
you
can
go
and
lie
down
in
the
kennel
the
straw
that
has
served
as
a
bed
for
my
poor
dog
for
the
last
four
years
is
still
there
if
unfortunately
robbers
should
come
remember
to
keep
your
ears
pricked
and
to
bark
after
giving
him
this
last
injunction
the
man
went
into
the
house
shut
the
door
and
put
up
the
chain
poor
pinocchio
remained
lying
on
the
ground
more
dead
than
alive
from
the
effects
of
cold
hunger
and
fear
from
time
to
time
he
put
his
hands
angrily
to
the
collar
that
tightened
his
throat
and
said
crying
it
serves
me
right
decidedly
it
serves
me
right
i
was
determined
to
be
a
vagabond
and
a
i
would
listen
to
bad
companions
and
that
is
why
i
always
meet
with
misfortunes
if
i
had
been
a
good
little
boy
as
so
many
are
if
i
had
remained
at
home
with
my
poor
papa
i
should
not
now
be
in
the
midst
of
the
fields
and
obliged
to
be
the

a
peasant
house
oh
if
i
could
be
born
again
but
now
it
is
too
late
and
i
must
have
patience
relieved
by
this
little
outburst
which
came
straight
from
his

pinocchio
discovers
the
robbers
he
had
been
sleeping
heavily
for
about
two
hours
when
towards
midnight
he
was
aroused
by
a
whispering
of
strange
voices
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
courtyard
putting
the
point
of
his
nose
out
of
the
kennel
he
saw
four
little
beasts
with
dark
fur
that
looked
like
cats
standing
consulting
together
but
they
were
not
cats
they
were
polecats
carnivorous
little
animals
especially
greedy
for
eggs
and
young
chickens
one
of
the
polecats
leaving
his
companions
came
to
the
opening
of
the
kennel
and
said
in
a
low
voice
good
evening
melampo
my
name
is
not

the

oh
then
who
are
you
i

dead
poor

was

good

judging
you

i

say
that
you

also
a

i
beg
your
pardon
i
am
not

not

then
what

you
are
acting
as
that

true
as
a
punishment
well
then
i
will
offer
you
the

conditions
that
we
made

sure
you
will
be
satisfied
with
them

manner
asked
pinocchio
certainly
and
we
were
always
on
the
best
terms
with
him
sleep
quietly
and
rest
assured
that
before
we
go
we
will
leave
by
the
kennel
a
beautiful
chicken
ready
plucked
for
your
breakfast
tomorrow
have
we
understood
each
other
clearly
only
too
clearly
answered
pinocchio
and
he
shook
his
head
threateningly
as
much
as
to
say
you
shall
hear
of
this
shortly
the
four
polecats
thinking
themselves
safe
repaired
to
the
which
was
close
to
the
kennel
and
having
opened
the
wooden
gate
with
their
teeth
and
claws
they
slipped
in
one
by
one
but
they
had
only
just
passed
through
when
they
heard
the
gate
shut
behind
them
with
great
violence
it
was
pinocchio
who
had
shut
it
and
for
greater
security
he
put
a
large
stone
against
it
to
keep
it
closed
he
then
began
to
bark
and
he
barked
exactly
like
a
hearing
the
barking
the
peasant
jumped
out
of
bed
and
taking
his
gun
he
came
to
the
window
and
asked
what
is
the
matter
there
are
robbers
answered
pinocchio
where
are
they
in
the
i
will
come
down
directly
in
fact
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
say
amen
the
peasant
came
down
he
rushed
into
the
caught
the
polecats
and
having
put
them
into
a
sack
he
said
to
them
in
a
tone
of
great
satisfaction
at
last
you
have
fallen
into
my
hands
i
might
punish
you
but
i
am
not
so
cruel
i
will
content
myself
instead
by
carrying
you
in
the
morning
to
the
innkeeper
of
the
neighboring
village
who
will
skin
and
cook
you
as
hares
with
a
sweet
and
sour
sauce
it
is
an
honor
that
you
deserve
but
generous
people
like
me
do
consider
such
trifles
he
then
approached
pinocchio
and
began
to
caress
him
and
amongst
other
things
he
asked
him
how
did
you
manage
to
discover
the
four
thieves
to
think
that
melampo
my
faithful
melampo
never
found
out
anything
the
puppet
might
then
have
told
him
the
whole
story
he
might
have
informed
him
of
the
disgraceful
conditions
that
had
been
made
between
the
dog
and
the
polecats
but
he
remembered
that
the
dog
was
dead
and
he
thought
to
himself
what
is
the
good
of
accusing
the
dead
the
dead
are
dead
and
the
best
thing
to
be
done
is
to
leave
them
in
peace
when
the
thieves
got
into
the
yard
were
you
asleep
or
awake
the
peasant
went
on
to
ask
him
i
was
asleep
answered
pinocchio
but
the
polecats
woke
me
with
their
chatter
and
one
of
them
came
to
the
kennel
and
said
to
me
you
promise
not
to
bark
and
not
to
wake
the
master
we
will
make
you
a
present
of
a
fine
chicken
ready
plucked
to
think
that
they
should
have
had
the
audacity
to
make
such
a
proposal
to
me
for
although
i
am
a
puppet
possessing
perhaps
nearly
all
the
faults
in
the
world
there
is
one
that
i
certainly
will
never
be
guilty
of
that
of
making
terms
with
and
sharing
the
gains
of
dishonest
people
well
said
my
boy
cried
the
peasant
slapping
him
on
the
shoulder
such
sentiments
do
you
honor
and
as
a
proof
of
my
gratitude
i
will
at
once
set
you
at
liberty
and
you
may
return
home

flies
to
the
seashore
as
soon
as
pinocchio
was
released
from
the
heavy
and
humiliating
weight
of
the
he
started
off
across
the
fields
and
never
stopped
until
he
had
reached
the
high
road
that
led
to
the
fairy
house
he
could
see
amongst
the
trees
the
top
of
the
big
oak
to
which
he
had
been
hung
but
although
he
looked
in
every
direction
the
little
house
belonging
to
the
beautiful
child
with
the
blue
hair
was
nowhere
visible
seized
with
a
sad
presentiment
he
began
to
run
with
all
the
strength
he
had
left
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
reached
the
field
where
the
little
white
house
had
once
stood
but
it
was
no
longer
there
instead
of
the
house
he
saw
a
marble
stone
on
which
were
engraved
these
sad
words
here
lies
the
child
with
the
blue
hair
who
died
from
sorrow
because
she
was
abandoned
by
her
little
brother
pinocchio
i
leave
you
to
imagine
the
puppet
feelings
when
he
had
with
difficulty
spelled
out
this
epitaph
he
fell
with
his
face
on
the
ground
and
covering
the
tombstone
with
a
thousand
kisses
burst
into
an
agony
of
tears
he
cried
all
night
and
when
morning
came
he
was
still
crying
although
he
had
no
tears
left
and
his
sobs
and
lamentations
were
so
acute
and
that
they
aroused
the
echoes
in
the
surrounding
hills
and
as
he
wept
he
said
oh
little
fairy
why
did
you
die
why
did
i
not
die
instead
of
you
i
who
am
so
wicked
whilst
you
were
so
good
and
my
papa
where
can
he
be
oh
little
fairy
tell
me
where
i
can
find
him
for
i
want
to
remain
with
him
always
and
never
leave
him
again
never
again
oh
little
fairy
tell
me
that
it
is
not
true
that
you
are
dead
if
you
really
love
your
little
brother
come
to
life
again
does
it
not
grieve
you
to
see
me
alone
and
abandoned
by
everybody
if
assassins
come
they
will
hang
me
again
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
then
i
should
die
indeed
what
do
you
imagine
that
i
can
do
here
alone
in
the
world
now
that
i
have
lost
you
and
my
papa
who
will
give
me
food
where
shall
i
go
to
sleep
at
night
who
will
make
me
a
new
jacket
oh
it
would
be
better
a
hundred
times
better
for
me
to
die
also
yes
i
want
to
die
oh
oh
oh
illustration
an
immense
serpent
stretched
across
the
road
and
in
his
despair
he
tried
to
tear
his
hair
but
his
hair
was
made
of
wood
so
he
could
not
even
have
the
satisfaction
of
sticking
his
fingers
into
it
just
then
a
large
pigeon
flew
over
his
head
and
stopping
with
distended
wings
called
down
to
him
from
a
great
height
tell
me
child
what
are
you
doing
there
do
you
see
i
am
crying
said
pinocchio
raising
his
head
towards
the
voice
and
rubbing
his
eyes
with
his
jacket
tell
me
continued
the
pigeon
amongst
your
companions
do
you
happen
to
know
a
puppet
who
is
called
pinocchio
pinocchio
did
you
say
pinocchio
repeated
the
puppet
jumping
quickly
to
his
feet
i
am
pinocchio
at
this
answer
the
pigeon
descended
rapidly
to
the
ground
he
was
larger
than
a
turkey
do
you
also
know
geppetto
he
asked
do
i
know
him
he
is
my
poor
papa
has
he
perhaps
spoken
to
you
of
me
will
you
take
me
to
him
is
he
still
alive
answer
me
for
pity
sake
is
he
still
alive
i
left
him
three
days
ago
on
the
seashore
what
was
he
doing
he
was
building
a
little
boat
for
himself
to
cross
the
ocean
for
more
than
three
months
that
poor
man
has
been
going
all
round
the
world
looking
for
you
not
having
succeeded
in
finding
you
he
has
now
taken
it
into
his
head
to
go
to
the
distant
countries
of
the
new
world
in
search
of
you
how
far
is
it
from
here
to
the
shore
asked
pinocchio
breathlessly
more
than
six
hundred
miles
six
hundred
miles
oh
beautiful
pigeon
what
a
fine
thing
it
would
be
to
have
your
wings
if
you
wish
to
go
i
will
carry
you
there
how
on
my
back
do
you
weigh
much
i
weigh
next
to
nothing
i
am
as
light
as
a
feather
and
without
waiting
for
more
pinocchio
jumped
at
once
on
the
back
and
putting
a
leg
on
each
side
of
him
as
men
do
on
horseback
he
exclaimed
joyfully
gallop
gallop
my
little
horse
for
i
am
anxious
to
arrive
quickly
the
pigeon
took
flight
and
in
a
few
minutes
had
soared
so
high
that
they
almost
touched
the
clouds
finding
himself
at
such
an
immense
height
the
puppet
had
the
curiosity
to
turn
and
look
down
but
his
head
spun
round
and
he
became
so
frightened
to
save
himself
from
the
danger
of
falling
he
wound
his
arms
tightly
round
the
neck
of
his
feathered
steed
they
flew
all
day
towards
evening
the
pigeon
said
i
am
very
thirsty
and
i
am
very
hungry
rejoined
pinocchio
let
us
stop
at
that
dovecote
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
we
will
continue
our
journey
so
that
we
may
reach
the
seashore
by
dawn
tomorrow
they
went
into
a
deserted
dovecote
where
they
found
nothing
but
a
basin
full
of
water
and
a
basket
full
of
vetch
the
puppet
had
never
in
his
life
been
able
to
eat
vetch
according
to
him
it
made
him
sick
that
evening
however
he
ate
to
repletion
and
when
he
had
nearly
emptied
the
basket
he
turned
to
the
pigeon
and
said
to
him
i
never
could
have
believed
that
vetch
was
so
good
be
assured
my
boy
replied
the
pigeon
that
when
hunger
is
real
and
there
is
nothing
else
to
eat
even
vetch
becomes
delicious
hunger
knows
neither
caprice
nor
greediness
having
quickly
finished
their
little
meal
they
recommenced
their
journey
and
flew
away
the
following
morning
they
reached
the
seashore
the
pigeon
placed
pinocchio
on
the
ground
and
not
wishing
to
be
troubled
with
thanks
for
having
done
a
good
action
flew
quickly
away
and
disappeared
the
shore
was
crowded
with
people
who
were
looking
out
to
sea
shouting
and
gesticulating
what
has
happened
asked
pinocchio
of
an
old
woman
a
poor
father
who
has
lost
his
son
has
gone
away
in
a
boat
to
search
for
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
and
today
the
sea
is
tempestuous
and
the
little
boat
is
in
danger
of
sinking
where
is
the
little
boat
it
is
out
there
in
a
line
with
my
finger
said
the
old
woman
pointing
to
a
little
boat
which
seen
at
that
distance
looked
like
a
nutshell
with
a
very
little
man
in
it
pinocchio
fixed
his
eyes
on
it
and
after
looking
attentively
he
gave
a
piercing
scream
crying
it
is
my
papa
it
is
my
papa
the
boat
meanwhile
beaten
by
the
fury
of
the
waves
at
one
moment
disappeared
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
and
the
next
came
again
to
the
surface
pinocchio
standing
on
the
top
of
a
high
rock
kept
calling
to
his
father
by
name
and
making
every
kind
of
signal
to
him
with
his
hands
his
handkerchief
and
his
cap
and
although
he
was
so
far
off
geppetto
appeared
to
recognize
his
son
for
he
also
took
off
his
cap
and
waved
it
and
tried
by
gestures
to
make
him
understand
that
he
would
have
returned
if
it
had
been
possible
but
that
the
sea
was
so
tempestuous
that
he
could
not
use
his
oars
or
approach
the
shore
suddenly
a
tremendous
wave
rose
and
the
boat
disappeared
they
waited
hoping
it
would
come
again
to
the
surface
but
it
was
seen
no
more
poor
man
said
the
fishermen
who
were
assembled
on
the
shore
murmuring
a
prayer
they
turned
to
go
home
just
then
they
heard
a
desperate
cry
and
looking
back
they
saw
a
little
boy
who
exclaimed
as
he
jumped
from
a
rock
into
the
sea
i
will
save
my
papa
pinocchio
being
made
of
wood
floated
easily
and
he
swam
like
a
fish
at
one
moment
they
saw
him
disappear
under
the
water
carried
down
by
the
fury
of
the
waves
and
next
he
reappeared
struggling
with
a
leg
or
an
arm
at
last
they
lost
sight
of
him
and
he
was
seen
no
more

pinocchio
hoping
to
be
in

to
help
his
father
swam
the
whole
night
and
what
a
horrible
night
it
was
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
it
hailed
the
thunder
was
frightful
and
the
flashes
of
lightning
made
it
as
light
as
day
towards
morning
he
saw
a
long
strip
of
land
not
far
off
it
was
an
island
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
he
tried
his
utmost
to
reach
the
shore
but
it
was
all
in
vain
the
waves
racing
and
tumbling
over
each
other
knocked
him
about
as
if
he
had
been
a
stick
or
a
wisp
of
straw
at
last
fortunately
for
him
a
billow
rolled
up
with
such
fury
and
impetuosity
that
he
was
lifted
up
and
thrown
far
on
to
the
sands
he
fell
with
such
force
that
as
he
struck
the
ground
his
ribs
and
all
his
joints
cracked
but
he
comforted
himself
saying
this
time
also
i
have
made
a
wonderful
escape
little
by
little
the
sky
cleared
the
sun
shone
out
in
all
his
splendor
and
the
sea
became
as
quiet
and
as
smooth
as
oil
the
puppet
put
his
clothes
in
the
sun
to
dry
and
began
to
look
in
every
direction
in
hopes
of
seeing
on
the
vast
expanse
of
water
a
little
boat
with
a
little
man
in
it
but
although
he
looked
and
looked
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
sky
and
the
sea
and
the
sail
of
some
ship
but
so
far
away
that
it
seemed
no
bigger
than
a
fly
if
i
only
knew
what
this
island
was
called
he
said
to
himself
if
i
only
knew
whether
it
was
inhabited
by
civilized
people
i
mean
by
people
who
have
not
the
bad
habit
of
hanging
boys
to
the
branches
of
the
trees
but
whom
can
i
ask
whom
if
there
is
nobody
this
idea
of
finding
himself
alone
alone
all
alone
in
the
midst
of
this
great
uninhabited
country
made
him
so
melancholy
that
he
was
just
beginning
to
cry
but
at
that
moment
at
a
short
distance
from
the
shore
he
saw
a
big
fish
swimming
by
it
was
going
quietly
on
its
own
business
with
its
head
out
of
the
water
not
knowing
its
name
the
puppet
called
to
it
in
a
loud
voice
to
make
himself
heard
eh
sir
fish
will
you
permit
me
a
word
with
you
two
if
you
like
answered
the
fish
who
was
a
dolphin
and
so
polite
that
few
similar
are
to
be
found
in
any
sea
in
the
world
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
if
there
are
villages
in
this
island
where
it
would
be
possible
to
obtain
something
to
eat
without
running
the
danger
of
being
eaten
certainly
there
are
replied
the
dolphin
indeed
you
will
find
one
at
a
short
distance
from
here
and
what
road
must
i
take
to
go
there
you
must
take
that
path
to
your
left
and
follow
your
nose
you
can
not
make
a
mistake
will
you
tell
me
another
thing
you
who
swim
about
the
sea
all
day
and
all
night
have
you
by
chance
met
a
little
boat
with
my
papa
in
it
and
who
is
your
papa
he
is
the
best
papa
in
the
world
whilst
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
worse
son
than
i
am
during
the
terrible
storm
last
night
answered
the
dolphin
the
little
boat
must
have
gone
to
the
bottom
and
my
papa
he
must
have
been
swallowed
by
the
terrible
who
for
some
days
past
has
been
spreading
devastation
and
ruin
in
our
waters
is
this
very
big
asked
pinocchio
who
was
already
beginning
to
quake
with
fear
big
replied
the
dolphin
that
you
may
form
some
idea
of
his
size
i
need
only
tell
you
that
he
is
bigger
than
a
house
and
that
his
mouth
is
so
enormous
and
so
deep
that
a
railway
train
with
its
smoking
engine
could
pass
down
his
throat
mercy
upon
us
exclaimed
the
terrified
puppet
and
putting
on
his
clothes
with
the
greatest
haste
he
said
to
the
dolphin
sir
fish
excuse
the
trouble
i
have
given
you
and
many
thanks
for
your
politeness
he
then
took
the
path
that
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
and
began
to
walk
fast
so
fast
indeed
that
he
was
almost
running
and
at
the
slightest
noise
he
turned
to
look
behind
him
fearing
that
he
might
see
the
terrible
with
a
railway
train
in
its
mouth
following
him
after
a
walk
of
half
an
hour
he
reached
a
little
village
called
the
village
of
the
industrious
bees
the
road
was
alive
with
people
running
here
and
there
to
attend
to
their
business
all
were
at
work
all
had
something
to
do
you
could
not
have
found
an
idler
or
a
vagabond
not
even
if
you
had
searched
for
him
with
a
lighted
lamp
ah
said
that
lazy
pinocchio
at
once
i
see
that
this
village
will
never
suit
me
i
was
born
to
work
in
the
meanwhile
he
was
tormented
by
hunger
for
he
had
eaten
nothing
for
hours
not
even
vetch
what
was
he
to
do
there
were
only
two
ways
by
which
he
could
obtain
food
either
by
asking
for
a
little
work
or
by
begging
for
a
nickel
or
for
a
mouthful
of
bread
he
was
ashamed
to
beg
for
his
father
had
always
preached
to
him
that
no
one
had
a
right
to
beg
except
the
aged
and
the
infirm
the
really
poor
in
this
world
deserving
of
compassion
and
assistance
are
only
those
who
from
age
or
sickness
are
no
longer
able
to
earn
their
own
bread
with
the
labor
of
their
hands
it
is
the
duty
of
every
one
else
to
work
and
if
they
will
not
work
so
much
the
worse
for
them
if
they
suffer
from
hunger
at
that
moment
a
man
came
down
the
road
tired
and
panting
for
breath
he
was
dragging
alone
with
fatigue
and
difficulty
two
carts
full
of
charcoal
pinocchio
judging
by
his
face
that
he
was
a
kind
man
approached
him
and
casting
down
his
eyes
with
shame
he
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
would
you
have
the
charity
to
give
me
a
nickel
for
i
am
dying
of
hunger
you
shall
have
not
only
a
nickel
said
the
man
but
i
will
give
you
a
quarter
provided
that
you
help
me
to
drag
home
these
two
carts
of
charcoal
i
am
surprised
at
you
answered
the
puppet
in
a
tone
of
offense
let
me
tell
you
that
i
am
not
accustomed
to
do
the
work
of
a
donkey
i
have
never
drawn
a
cart
so
much
the
better
for
you
answered
the
man
then
my
boy
if
you
are
really
dying
of
hunger
eat
two
fine
slices
of
your
pride
and
be
careful
not
to
get
indigestion
a
few
minutes
afterwards
a
mason
passed
down
the
road
carrying
on
his
shoulders
a
basket
of
lime
would
you
have
the
charity
good
man
to
give
a
nickel
to
a
poor
boy
who
is
yawning
for
want
of
food
willingly
answered
the
man
come
with
me
and
carry
the
lime
and
instead
of
a
nickel
i
will
give
you
a
quarter
but
the
lime
is
heavy
objected
pinocchio
and
i
do
want
to
tire
myself
if
you
do
want
to
tire
yourself
then
my
boy
amuse
yourself
with
yawning
and
much
good
may
it
do
you
in
less
than
half
an
hour
twenty
other
people
went
by
and
pinocchio
asked
charity
of
them
all
but
they
all
answered
are
you
not
ashamed
to
beg
instead
of
idling
about
the
roads
go
and
look
for
a
little
work
and
learn
to
earn
your
bread
at
last
a
nice
little
woman
carrying
two
cans
of
water
came
by
will
you
let
me
drink
a
little
water
out
of
your
can
asked
pinocchio
who
was
burning
with
thirst
drink
my
boy
if
you
wish
it
said
the
little
woman
setting
down
the
two
cans
pinocchio
drank
like
a
fish
and
as
he
dried
his
mouth
he
mumbled
i
have
quenched
my
thirst
if
i
could
only
appease
my
hunger
the
good
woman
hearing
these
words
said
at
once
if
you
will
help
me
to
carry
home
these
two
cans
of
water
i
will
give
you
a
fine
piece
of
bread
pinocchio
looked
at
the
can
and
answered
neither
yes
nor
no
and
besides
the
bread
you
shall
have
a
nice
dish
of
cauliflower
dressed
with
oil
and
vinegar
added
the
good
woman
pinocchio
gave
another
look
at
the
can
and
answered
neither
yes
nor
no
and
after
the
cauliflower
i
will
give
you
a
beautiful
bonbon
full
of
syrup
the
temptation
of
this
last
dainty
was
so
great
that
pinocchio
could
resist
no
longer
and
with
an
air
of
decision
he
said
i
must
have
patience
i
will
carry
the
can
to
your
house
the
can
was
heavy
and
the
puppet
not
being
strong
enough
to
carry
it
in
his
hand
had
to
resign
himself
to
carry
it
on
his
head
when
they
reached
the
house
the
good
little
woman
made
pinocchio
sit
down
at
a
small
table
already
laid
and
she
placed
before
him
the
bread
the
cauliflower
and
the
bonbon
pinocchio
did
not
eat
he
devoured
his
stomach
was
like
an
apartment
that
had
been
left
empty
and
uninhabited
for
five
months
when
his
ravenous
hunger
was
somewhat
appeased
he
raised
his
head
to
thank
his
benefactress
but
he
had
no
sooner
looked
at
her
than
he
gave
a
prolonged
of
astonishment
and
continued
staring
at
her
with
wide
open
eyes
his
fork
in
the
air
and
his
mouth
full
of
bread
and
cauliflower
as
if
he
had
been
bewitched
what
has
surprised
you
so
much
asked
the
good
woman
laughing
it
is
answered
the
puppet
it
is
it
is
that
you
are
like
that
you
remind
me
yes
yes
yes
the
same
voice
the
same
eyes
the
same
hair
yes
yes
yes
you
also
have
blue
hair
as
she
had
oh
little
fairy
tell
me
that
it
is
you
really
you
do
not
make
me
cry
any
more
if
you
knew
i
have
cried
so
much
i
have
suffered
so
much
and
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
on
the
floor
pinocchio
embraced
the
knees
of
the
mysterious
little
woman
and
began
to
cry
bitterly
illustration
chapter
xxv
pinocchio
promises
the
fairy
to
be
good
at
first
the
good
little
woman
maintained
that
she
was
not
the
little
fairy
with
blue
hair
but
seeing
that
she
was
found
out
and
not
wishing
to
continue
the
comedy
any
longer
she
ended
by
making
herself
known
and
she
said
to
pinocchio
you
little
rogue
how
did
you
ever
discover
who
i
was
it
was
my
great
affection
for
you
that
told
me
do
you
remember
you
left
me
a
child
and
now
that
you
have
found
me
again
i
am
a
woman
a
woman
almost
old
enough
to
be
your
mamma
i
am
delighted
at
that
for
now
instead
of
calling
you
little
sister
i
will
call
you
mamma
i
have
wished
for
such
a
long
time
to
have
a
mamma
like
other
boys
but
how
did
you
manage
to
grow
so
fast
that
is
a
secret
teach
it
to
me
for
i
should
also
like
to
grow
do
you
see
i
always
remain
no
bigger
than
a
ninepin
but
you
can
not
grow
replied
the
fairy
why
because
puppets
never
grow
they
are
born
puppets
live
puppets
and
die
puppets
oh
i
am
sick
of
being
a
puppet
cried
pinocchio
giving
himself
a
slap
it
is
time
that
i
became
a
man
and
you
will
become
one
if
you
know
how
to
deserve
it
not
really
and
what
can
i
do
to
deserve
it
a
very
easy
thing
by
learning
to
be
a
good
boy
and
you
think
i
am
not
you
are
quite
the
contrary
good
boys
are
obedient
and
you
and
i
never
obey
good
boys
like
to
learn
and
to
work
and
you
and
i
instead
lead
an
idle
vagabond
life
the
year
through
good
boys
always
speak
the
truth
and
i
always
tell
lies
good
boys
go
willingly
to
school
and
school
gives
me
pain
all
over
the
body
but
from
today
i
will
change
my
life
do
you
promise
me
i
promise
you
i
will
become
a
good
little
boy
and
i
will
be
the
consolation
of
my
papa
where
is
my
poor
papa
at
this
moment
i
do
not
know
shall
i
ever
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
him
again
and
kissing
him
i
think
so
indeed
i
am
sure
of
it
at
this
answer
pinocchio
was
so
delighted
that
he
took
the
fairy
hands
and
began
to
kiss
them
with
such
fervor
that
he
seemed
beside
himself
then
raising
his
face
and
looking
at
her
lovingly
he
asked
tell
me
little
mamma
then
it
was
not
true
that
you
were
dead
it
seems
not
said
the
fairy
smiling
if
you
only
knew
the
sorrow
i
felt
and
the
tightening
of
my
throat
when
i
read
lies
i
know
it
and
it
is
on
that
account
that
i
have
forgiven
you
i
saw
from
the
sincerity
of
your
grief
that
you
had
a
good
heart
and
when
boys
have
good
hearts
even
if
they
are
scamps
and
have
got
bad
habits
there
is
always
something
to
hope
for
that
is
there
is
always
hope
that
they
will
turn
to
better
ways
that
is
why
i
came
to
look
for
you
here
i
will
be
your
mamma
oh
how
delightful
shouted
pinocchio
jumping
for
joy
you
must
obey
me
and
do
everything
that
i
bid
you
willingly
willingly
willingly
tomorrow
rejoined
the
fairy
you
will
begin
to
go
to
school
pinocchio
became
at
once
a
little
less
joyful
then
you
must
choose
an
art
or
a
trade
according
to
your
own
wishes
pinocchio
became
very
grave
what
are
you
muttering
between
your
teeth
asked
the
fairy
in
an
angry
voice
i
was
saying
moaned
the
puppet
in
a
low
voice
that
it
seemed
to
me
too
late
for
me
to
go
to
school
now
no
sir
keep
it
in
mind
that
it
is
never
too
late
to
learn
and
to
instruct
ourselves
but
i
do
not
wish
to
follow
either
an
art
or
a
trade
why
because
it
tires
me
to
work
my
boy
said
the
fairy
those
who
talk
in
that
way
end
almost
always
either
in
prison
or
in
the
hospital
let
me
tell
you
that
every
man
whether
he
is
born
rich
or
poor
is
obliged
to
do
something
in
this
world
to
occupy
himself
to
work
woe
to
those
who
lead
slothful
lives
sloth
is
a
dreadful
illness
and
must
be
cured
at
once
in
childhood
if
not
when
we
are
old
it
can
never
be
cured
pinocchio
was
touched
by
these
words
and
lifting
his
head
quickly
he
said
to
the
fairy
i
will
study
i
will
work
i
will
do
all
that
you
tell
me
for
indeed
i
have
become
weary
of
being
a
puppet
and
i
wish
at
any
price
to
become
a
boy
you
promised
me
that
i
should
did
you
not
i
did
promise
you
and
it
now
depends
upon
yourself

xxvi
the
terrible
the
following
day
pinocchio
went
to
the
government
school
imagine
the
delight
of
all
the
little
rogues
when
they
saw
a
puppet
walk
into
their
school
they
set
up
a
roar
of
laughter
that
never
ended
they
played
him
all
sorts
of
tricks
one
boy
carried
off
his
cap
another
pulled
his
jacket
behind
one
tried
to
give
him
a
pair
of
inky
mustachios
just
under
his
nose
and
another
attempted
to
tie
strings
to
his
feet
and
hands
to
make
him
dance
for
a
short
time
pinocchio
pretended
not
to
care
and
got
on
as
well
as
he
could
but
at
last
losing
all
patience
he
turned
to
those
who
were
teasing
him
most
and
making
game
of
him
and
said
to
them
looking
very
angry
beware
boys
i
have
not
come
here
to
be
your
buffoon
i
respect
others
and
i
intend
to
be
respected
illustration
oh
i
am
sick
of
being
a
puppet
cried
pinocchio
well
said
boaster
you
have
spoken
like
a
book
howled
the
young
rascals
convulsed
with
mad
laughter
and
one
of
them
more
impertinent
than
the
others
stretched
out
his
hand
intending
to
seize
the
puppet
by
the
end
of
his
nose
but
he
was
not
in
time
for
pinocchio
stuck
his
leg
out
from
under
the
table
and
gave
him
a
great
kick
on
his
shins
oh
what
hard
feet
roared
the
boy
rubbing
the
bruise
that
the
puppet
had
given
him
and
what
elbows
even
harder
than
his
feet
said
another
who
for
his
rude
tricks
had
received
a
blow
in
the
stomach
but
nevertheless
the
kick
and
the
blow
acquired
at
once
for
pinocchio
the
sympathy
and
the
esteem
of
all
the
boys
in
the
school
they
all
made
friends
with
him
and
liked
him
heartily
and
even
the
master
praised
him
for
he
found
him
attentive
studious
and
intelligent
always
the
first
to
come
to
school
and
the
last
to
leave
when
school
was
over
but
he
had
one
fault
he
made
too
many
friends
and
amongst
them
were
several
young
rascals
well
known
for
their
dislike
to
study
and
love
of
mischief
the
master
warned
him
every
day
and
even
the
good
fairy
never
failed
to
tell
him
and
to
repeat
constantly
take
care
pinocchio
those
bad
of
yours
will
end
sooner
or
later
by
making
you
lose
all
love
of
study
and
perhaps
they
may
even
bring
upon
you
some
great
misfortune
there
is
no
fear
of
that
answered
the
puppet
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
touching
his
forehead
as
much
as
to
say
there
is
so
much
sense
here
now
it
happened
that
one
fine
day
as
he
was
on
his
way
to
school
he
met
several
of
his
usual
companions
who
coming
up
to
him
asked
have
you
heard
the
great
news
no
in
the
sea
near
here
a
has
appeared
as
big
as
a
mountain
not
really
can
it
be
the
same
that
was
there
when
my
papa
was
drowned
we
are
going
to
the
shore
to
see
him
will
you
come
with
us
no
i
am
going
to
school
what
matters
school
we
can
go
to
school
tomorrow
whether
we
have
a
lesson
more
or
a
lesson
less
we
shall
always
remain
the
same
donkeys
but
what
will
the
master
say
the
master
may
say
what
he
likes
he
is
paid
on
purpose
to
grumble
all
day
and
my
mamma
mammas
know
nothing
answered
those
bad
little
boys
do
you
know
what
i
will
do
said
pinocchio
i
have
reasons
for
wishing
to
see
the
but
i
will
go
and
see
him
when
school
is
over
poor
donkey
exclaimed
one
of
the
number
do
you
suppose
that
a
fish
of
that
size
will
wait
your
convenience
as
soon
as
he
is
tired
of
being
here
he
will
start
for
another
place
and
then
it
will
be
too
late
how
long
does
it
take
to
go
from
here
to
the
shore
asked
the
puppet
we
can
be
there
and
back
in
an
hour
then
away
shouted
pinocchio
and
he
who
runs
fastest
is
the
best
having
thus
given
the
signal
to
start
the
boys
with
their
books
and
under
their
arms
rushed
off
across
the
fields
and
pinocchio
was
always
the
first
he
seemed
to
have
wings
to
his
feet
from
time
to
time
he
turned
to
jeer
at
his
companions
who
were
some
distance
behind
and
seeing
them
panting
for
breath
covered
with
dust
and
their
tongues
hanging
out
of
their
mouths
he
laughed
heartily
the
unfortunate
boy
little
knew
what
terrors
and
horrible
disasters
he
was
going
to
meet
with

chapter
xxvii
pinocchio
is
arrested
by
the
gendarmes
when
he
arrived
on
the
shore
pinocchio
looked
out
to
sea
but
he
saw
no
the
sea
was
as
smooth
as
a
great
crystal
mirror
where
is
the
he
asked
turning
to
his
companions
he
must
have
gone
to
have
his
breakfast
said
one
of
them
laughing
or
he
has
thrown
himself
on
to
his
bed
to
have
a
little
nap
added
another
laughing
still
louder
from
their
absurd
answers
and
silly
laughter
pinocchio
perceived
that
his
companions
had
been
making
a
fool
of
him
in
inducing
him
to
believe
a
tale
with
no
truth
in
it
taking
it
very
badly
he
said
to
them
angrily
and
now
may
i
ask
what
fun
you
could
find
in
deceiving
me
with
the
story
of
the
oh
it
was
great
fun
answered
the
little
rascals
in
chorus
and
in
what
did
it
consist
in
making
you
miss
school
and
persuading
you
to
come
with
us
are
you
not
ashamed
of
being
always
so
punctual
and
so
diligent
with
your
lessons
are
you
not
ashamed
of
studying
so
hard
and
if
i
study
hard
what
concern
is
it
of
yours
it
concerns
us
excessively
because
it
makes
us
appear
in
a
bad
light
to
the
master
why
because
boys
who
study
make
those
who
like
us
have
no
wish
to
learn
seem
worse
by
comparison
and
that
is
too
bad
we
too
have
our
pride
then
what
must
i
do
to
please
you
you
must
follow
our
example
and
hate
school
lessons
and
the
master
our
three
greatest
enemies
and
if
i
wish
to
continue
my
studies
in
that
case
we
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
and
at
the
first
opportunity
we
will
make
you
pay
for
it
really
said
the
puppet
shaking
his
head
you
make
me
inclined
to
laugh
eh
pinocchio
shouted
the
biggest
of
the
boys
confronting
him
none
of
your
superior
airs
do
come
here
to
crow
over
us
for
if
you
are
not
afraid
of
us
we
are
not
afraid
of
you
remember
that
you
are
one
against
seven
of
us
seven
like
the
seven
deadly
sins
said
pinocchio
with
a
shout
of
laughter
listen
to
him
he
has
insulted
us
all
he
called
us
the
seven
deadly
sins
take
that
to
begin
with
and
keep
it
for
your
supper
tonight
said
one
of
the
boys
and
so
saying
he
gave
him
a
blow
on
the
head
with
his
fist
but
it
was
give
and
take
for
the
puppet
as
was
to
be
expected
immediately
returned
the
blow
and
the
fight
in
a
moment
became
general
and
desperate
pinocchio
although
he
was
one
alone
defended
himself
like
a
hero
he
used
his
feet
which
were
of
the
hardest
wood
to
such
purpose
that
he
kept
his
enemies
at
a
respectful
distance
wherever
they
touched
they
left
a
bruise
by
way
of
reminder
the
boys
becoming
furious
at
not
being
able
to
measure
themselves
hand
to
hand
with
the
puppet
had
recourse
to
other
weapons
loosening
their
satchels
they
commenced
throwing
their
at
him
grammars
dictionaries
geography
books
and
other
scholastic
works
but
pinocchio
was
quick
and
had
sharp
eyes
and
always
managed
to
duck
in
time
so
that
the
books
passed
over
his
head
and
all
fell
into
the
sea
imagine
the
astonishment
of
the
fish
thinking
that
the
books
were
something
to
eat
they
all
arrived
in
shoals
but
having
tasted
a
page
or
two
or
a
frontispiece
they
spat
it
quickly
out
and
made
a
wry
face
that
seemed
to
say
it
is
food
for
us
we
are
accustomed
to
something
much
better
the
battle
meantime
had
become
fiercer
than
ever
when
a
big
crab
who
had
come
out
of
the
water
and
had
climbed
slowly
up
on
the
shore
called
out
in
a
hoarse
voice
that
sounded
like
a
trumpet
with
a
bad
cold
illustration
four
rabbits
as
black
as
ink
entered
carrying
a
little
bier
have
done
with
that
you
young
ruffians
for
you
are
nothing
else
these
fights
between
boys
seldom
finish
well
some
disaster
is
sure
to
happen
poor
crab
he
might
as
well
have
preached
to
the
wind
even
that
young
rascal
pinocchio
turning
around
looked
at
him
mockingly
and
said
rudely
hold
your
tongue
you
tiresome
crab
you
had
better
suck
some
liquorice
lozenges
to
cure
that
cold
in
your
throat
just
then
the
boys
who
had
no
more
books
of
their
own
to
throw
spied
at
a
little
distance
the
satchel
that
belonged
to
pinocchio
and
took
possession
of
it
amongst
the
books
there
was
one
bound
in
strong
cardboard
with
the
back
and
points
of
parchment
it
was
a
treatise
on
arithmetic
one
of
the
boys
seized
this
volume
and
aiming
at
pinocchio
head
threw
it
at
him
with
all
the
force
he
could
muster
but
instead
of
hitting
the
puppet
it
struck
one
of
his
companions
on
the
temple
who
turning
as
white
as
a
sheet
said
only
oh
mother
help
i
am
dying
and
fell
his
whole
length
on
the
sand
thinking
he
was
dead
the
terrified
boys
ran
off
as
hard
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
out
of
sight
but
pinocchio
remained
although
from
grief
and
fright
he
was
more
dead
than
alive
nevertheless
he
ran
and
soaked
his
handkerchief
in
the
sea
and
began
to
bathe
the
temples
of
his
poor
crying
bitterly
in
his
despair
he
kept
calling
him
by
name
and
saying
to
him
eugene
my
poor
eugene
open
your
eyes
and
look
at
me
why
do
you
not
answer
i
did
not
do
it
indeed
it
was
not
i
that
hurt
you
so
believe
me
it
was
not
open
your
eyes
eugene
if
you
keep
your
eyes
shut
i
shall
die
too
oh
what
shall
i
do
how
shall
i
ever
return
home
how
can
i
ever
have
the
courage
to
go
back
to
my
good
mamma
what
will
become
of
me
where
can
i
fly
to
oh
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
a
thousand
times
better
if
i
had
only
gone
to
school
why
did
i
listen
to
my
companions
they
have
been
my
ruin
the
master
said
to
me
and
my
mamma
repeated
it
often
of
bad
companions
oh
dear
what
will
become
of
me
what
will
become
of
me
what
will
become
of
me
and
pinocchio
began
to
cry
and
sob
and
to
strike
his
head
with
his
fists
and
to
call
poor
eugene
by
his
name
suddenly
he
heard
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
he
turned
and
saw
two
soldiers
what
are
you
doing
there
lying
on
the
ground
they
asked
pinocchio
i
am
helping
my
has
he
been
hurt
so
it
seems
hurt
indeed
said
one
of
them
stooping
down
and
examining
eugene
closely
this
boy
has
been
wounded
in
the
temple
who
wounded
him
not
i
stammered
the
puppet
breathlessly
if
it
was
not
you
who
then
did
it
not
i
repeated
pinocchio
and
with
what
was
he
wounded
with
this
book
and
the
puppet
picked
up
from
the
ground
the
treatise
on
arithmetic
bound
in
cardboard
and
parchment
and
showed
it
to
the
soldier
and
to
whom
does
this
belong
to
me
that
is
enough
nothing
more
is
wanted
get
up
and
come
with
us
at
once
but
i
come
along
with
us
but
i
am
innocent
come
along
with
us
before
they
left
the
soldiers
called
some
fishermen
who
were
passing
at
that
moment
near
the
shore
in
their
boat
and
said
to
them
we
give
this
boy
who
has
been
wounded
in
the
head
in
your
charge
carry
him
to
your
house
and
nurse
him
tomorrow
we
will
come
and
see
him
they
then
turned
to
pinocchio
and
having
placed
him
between
them
they
said
to
him
in
a
commanding
voice
forward
and
walk
quickly
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
without
requiring
it
to
be
repeated
the
puppet
set
out
along
the
road
leading
to
the
village
but
the
poor
little
devil
hardly
knew
where
he
was
he
thought
he
must
be
dreaming
and
what
a
dreadful
dream
he
was
beside
himself
he
saw
double
his
legs
shook
his
tongue
clung
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
and
he
could
not
utter
a
word
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
his
stupefaction
and
apathy
his
heart
was
pierced
by
a
cruel
thorn
the
thought
that
he
would
pass
under
the
windows
of
the
good
fairy
house
between
the
soldiers
he
would
rather
have
died
they
had
already
reached
the
village
when
a
gust
of
wind
blew
pinocchio
cap
off
his
head
and
carried
it
ten
yards
off
will
you
permit
me
said
the
puppet
to
the
soldiers
to
go
and
get
my
cap
go
then
but
be
quick
about
it
the
puppet
went
and
picked
up
his
cap
but
instead
of
putting
it
on
his
head
he
took
it
between
his
teeth
and
began
to
run
as
hard
as
he
could
towards
the
seashore
the
soldiers
thinking
it
would
be
difficult
to
overtake
him
sent
after
him
a
large
mastiff
who
had
won
the
first
prizes
at
all
the
dog
races
pinocchio
ran
but
the
dog
ran
faster
the
people
came
to
their
windows
and
crowded
into
the
street
in
their
anxiety
to
see
the
end
of
the
desperate
race
illustration
chapter
xxviii
pinocchio
escapes
being
fried
like
a
fish
there
came
a
moment
in
this
desperate
race
a
terrible
moment
when
pinocchio
thought
himself
lost
for
alidoro
the
mastiff
had
run
so
swiftly
that
he
had
nearly
come
up
with
him
the
puppet
could
hear
the
panting
of
the
dreadful
beast
close
behind
him
there
was
not
a
hand
breadth
between
them
he
could
even
feel
the
dog
hot
breath
fortunately
the
shore
was
close
and
the
sea
but
a
few
steps
off
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
sands
the
puppet
made
a
wonderful
leap
a
frog
could
have
done
no
better
and
plunged
into
the
water
alidoro
on
the
contrary
wished
to
stop
himself
but
carried
away
by
the
impetus
of
the
race
he
also
went
into
the
sea
the
unfortunate
dog
could
not
swim
but
he
made
great
efforts
to
keep
himself
afloat
with
his
paws
but
the
more
he
struggled
the
farther
he
sank
head
downwards
under
the
water
when
he
rose
to
the
surface
again
his
eyes
were
rolling
with
terror
and
he
barked
out
i
am
drowning
i
am
drowning
drown
shouted
pinocchio
from
a
distance
seeing
himself
safe
from
all
danger
help
me
dear
pinocchio
save
me
from
death
at
that
agonizing
cry
the
puppet
who
had
in
reality
an
excellent
heart
was
moved
with
compassion
and
turning
to
the
dog
he
said
but
if
i
save
your
life
will
you
promise
to
give
me
no
further
annoyance
and
not
to
run
after
me
i
promise
i
promise
be
quick
for
pity
sake
for
if
you
delay
another
i
shall
be
dead
pinocchio
hesitated
but
remembering
that
his
father
had
often
told
him
that
a
good
action
is
never
lost
he
swam
to
alidoro
and
taking
hold
of
his
tail
with
both
hands
brought
him
safe
and
sound
on
to
the
dry
sand
of
the
beach
the
poor
dog
could
not
stand
he
had
drunk
so
much
salt
water
that
he
was
like
a
balloon
the
puppet
however
not
wishing
to
trust
him
too
far
thought
it
more
prudent
to
jump
again
into
the
water
when
he
had
swum
some
distance
from
the
shore
he
called
out
to
the
friend
he
had
rescued
alidoro
a
good
journey
to
you
and
take
my
compliments
to
all
at
home
pinocchio
answered
the
dog
a
thousand
thanks
for
having
saved
my
life
you
have
done
me
a
great
service
and
in
this
world
what
is
given
is
returned
if
an
occasion
offers
i
shall
not
forget
it
pinocchio
swam
on
keeping
always
near
the
land
at
last
he
thought
that
he
had
reached
a
safe
place
giving
a
look
along
the
shore
he
saw
amongst
the
rocks
a
kind
of
cave
from
which
a
cloud
of
smoke
was
ascending
in
that
cave
he
said
to
himself
there
must
be
a
fire
so
much
the
better
i
will
go
and
dry
and
warm
myself
and
then
and
then
we
shall
see
having
taken
the
resolution
he
approached
the
rocks
but
as
he
was
going
to
climb
up
he
felt
something
under
the
water
that
rose
higher
and
higher
and
carried
him
into
the
air
he
tried
to
escape
but
it
was
too
late
for
to
his
extreme
surprise
he
found
himself
enclosed
in
a
great
net
together
with
a
swarm
of
fish
of
every
size
and
shape
who
were
flapping
and
struggling
like
so
many
despairing
souls
at
the
same
moment
a
fisherman
came
out
of
the
cave
he
was
so
ugly
so
horribly
ugly
that
he
looked
like
a
sea
monster
instead
of
hair
his
head
was
covered
with
a
thick
bush
of
green
grass
his
skin
was
green
his
eyes
were
green
his
long
beard
that
came
down
to
the
ground
was
also
green
he
had
the
appearance
of
an
immense
lizard
standing
on
its
when
the
fisherman
had
drawn
his
net
out
of
the
sea
he
exclaimed
with
great
satisfaction
thank
heaven
again
today
i
shall
have
a
splendid
feast
of
fish
what
a
mercy
that
i
am
not
a
fish
said
pinocchio
to
himself
regaining
a
little
courage
the
netful
of
fish
was
carried
into
the
cave
which
was
dark
and
smoky
in
the
middle
of
the
cave
a
large
full
of
oil
was
frying
and
sending
out
a
smell
of
mushrooms
that
was
suffocating
now
we
will
see
what
fish
we
have
taken
said
the
green
fisherman
and
putting
into
the
net
an
enormous
hand
so
out
of
all
proportion
that
it
looked
like
a
baker
shovel
he
pulled
out
a
handful
of
fish
these
fish
are
good
he
said
looking
at
them
and
smelling
them
complacently
and
after
he
had
smelled
them
he
threw
them
into
a
pan
without
water
he
repeated
the
same
operation
many
times
and
as
he
drew
out
the
fish
his
mouth
watered
and
he
said
chuckling
to
himself
what
good
whiting
what
exquisite
sardines
these
soles
are
delicious
and
these
crabs
excellent
what
dear
little
anchovies
the
last
to
remain
in
the
net
was
pinocchio
no
sooner
had
the
fisherman
taken
him
out
than
he
opened
his
big
green
eyes
with
astonishment
and
cried
half
frightened
what
species
of
fish
is
this
fish
of
this
kind
i
never
remember
to
have
eaten
and
he
looked
at
him
again
attentively
and
having
examined
him
well
all
over
he
ended
by
saying
i
know
he
must
be
a
pinocchio
mortified
at
being
mistaken
for
a
said
in
an
angry
voice
a
indeed
do
you
take
me
for
a
what
treatment
let
me
tell
you
that
i
am
a
puppet
a
puppet
replied
the
fisherman
to
tell
the
truth
a
puppet
is
quite
a
new
fish
for
me
all
the
better
i
shall
eat
you
with
greater
pleasure
eat
me
but
will
you
understand
that
i
am
not
a
fish
do
you
hear
that
i
talk
and
reason
as
you
do
that
is
quite
true
said
the
fisherman
and
as
i
see
that
you
are
a
fish
possessed
of
the
talent
of
talking
and
reasoning
as
i
do
i
will
treat
you
with
all
the
attention
that
is
your
due
and
this
attention
in
token
of
my
friendship
and
particular
regard
i
will
leave
you
the
choice
of
how
you
would
like
to
be
cooked
would
you
like
to
be
fried
in
the
or
would
you
prefer
to
be
stewed
with
tomato
sauce
to
tell
the
truth
answered
pinocchio
if
i
am
to
choose
i
should
prefer
to
be
set
at
liberty
and
to
return
home
you
are
joking
do
you
imagine
that
i
would
lose
the
opportunity
of
tasting
such
a
rare
fish
it
is
not
every
day
i
assure
you
that
a
puppet
fish
is
caught
in
these
waters
leave
it
to
me
i
will
fry
you
in
the
with
the
other
fish
and
you
will
be
quite
satisfied
it
is
always
consolation
to
be
fried
in
company
at
this
speech
the
unhappy
pinocchio
began
to
cry
and
scream
and
to
implore
for
mercy
and
he
said
sobbing
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
if
i
had
gone
to
school
i
would
listen
to
my
companions
and
now
i
am
paying
for
it
and
he
wriggled
like
an
eel
and
made
indescribable
efforts
to
slip
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
green
fisherman
but
it
was
useless
the
fisherman
took
a
long
strip
of
rush
and
having
bound
his
hands
and
feet
as
if
he
had
been
a
sausage
he
threw
him
into
the
pan
with
the
other
fish
he
then
fetched
a
wooden
bowl
full
of
flour
and
began
to
flour
them
each
in
turn
and
as
soon
as
they
were
ready
he
threw
them
into
the
the
first
to
dance
in
the
boiling
oil
were
the
poor
whitings
the
crabs
followed
then
the
sardines
then
the
soles
then
the
anchovies
and
at
last
it
was
pinocchio
turn
seeing
himself
so
near
death
and
such
a
horrible
death
he
was
so
frightened
and
trembled
so
violently
that
he
had
neither
voice
nor
breath
left
for
further
entreaties
but
the
poor
boy
implored
with
his
eyes
the
green
fisherman
however
without
caring
in
the
least
plunged
him
five
or
six
times
in
the
flour
until
he
was
white
from
head
to
foot
and
looked
like
a
puppet
made
of
plaster
illustration
chapter
xxix
he
returns
to
the
fairy
house
just
as
the
fisherman
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
pinocchio
into
the
a
large
dog
entered
the
cave
enticed
there
by
the
strong
and
savory
odor
of
fried
fish
get
out
shouted
the
fisherman
threateningly
holding
the
floured
puppet
in
his
hand
but
the
poor
dog
who
was
as
hungry
as
a
wolf
whined
and
wagged
his
tail
as
much
as
to
say
give
me
a
mouthful
of
fish
and
i
will
leave
you
in
peace
get
out
i
tell
you
repeated
the
fisherman
and
he
stretched
out
his
leg
to
give
him
a
kick
but
the
dog
who
when
he
was
really
hungry
would
not
stand
trifling
turned
upon
him
growling
and
showing
his
terrible
tusks
at
that
moment
a
little
feeble
voice
was
heard
in
the
cave
saying
entreatingly
save
me
alidoro
if
you
do
not
save
me
i
shall
be
fried
the
dog
recognized
pinocchio
voice
and
to
his
extreme
surprise
perceived
that
it
proceeded
from
the
floured
bundle
that
the
fisherman
held
in
his
hand
so
what
do
you
think
he
did
he
made
a
spring
seized
the
bundle
in
his
mouth
and
holding
it
gently
between
his
teeth
he
rushed
out
of
the
cave
and
was
gone
like
a
flash
of
lightning
the
fisherman
furious
at
seeing
a
fish
he
was
so
anxious
to
eat
snatched
from
him
ran
after
the
dog
but
he
had
not
gone
many
steps
when
he
was
taken
with
a
fit
of
coughing
and
had
to
give
it
up
alidoro
when
he
had
reached
the
path
that
led
to
the
village
stopped
and
put
his
friend
pinocchio
gently
on
the
ground
how
much
i
have
to
thank
you
for
said
the
puppet
there
is
no
necessity
replied
the
dog
you
saved
me
and
i
have
now
returned
it
you
know
that
we
must
all
help
each
other
in
this
world
but
how
came
you
to
come
to
the
cave
i
was
lying
on
the
shore
more
dead
than
alive
when
the
wind
brought
to
me
the
smell
of
fried
fish
the
smell
excited
my
appetite
and
i
followed
it
up
if
i
had
arrived
a
second
later
do
not
mention
it
groaned
pinocchio
who
was
still
trembling
with
fright
do
not
mention
it
if
you
had
arrived
a
second
later
i
should
by
this
time
have
been
fried
eaten
and
digested
brrr
it
makes
me
shudder
only
to
think
of
it
alidoro
laughing
extended
his
right
paw
to
the
puppet
who
shook
it
heartily
in
token
of
great
friendship
and
they
then
separated
the
dog
took
the
road
home
and
pinocchio
left
alone
went
to
a
cottage
not
far
off
and
said
to
a
little
old
man
who
was
warming
himself
in
the
sun
tell
me
good
man
do
you
know
anything
of
a
poor
boy
called
eugene
who
was
wounded
in
the
head
the
boy
was
brought
by
some
fishermen
to
this
cottage
and
now
and
now
he
is
dead
interrupted
pinocchio
with
great
sorrow
no
he
is
alive
and
has
returned
to
his
home
not
really
not
really
cried
the
puppet
dancing
with
delight
then
the
wound
was
not
serious
it
might
have
been
very
serious
and
even
fatal
answered
the
little
old
man
for
they
threw
a
thick
book
bound
in
cardboard
at
his
head
and
who
threw
it
at
him
one
of
his
a
certain
pinocchio
and
who
is
this
pinocchio
asked
the
puppet
pretending
ignorance
they
say
that
he
is
a
bad
boy
a
vagabond
a
regular
calumnies
all
calumnies
do
you
know
this
pinocchio
by
sight
answered
the
puppet
and
what
is
your
opinion
of
him
asked
the
little
man
he
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
good
boy
anxious
to
learn
and
obedient
and
affectionate
to
his
father
and
family
whilst
the
puppet
was
firing
off
all
these
lies
he
touched
his
nose
and
perceived
that
it
had
lengthened
more
than
a
hand
very
much
alarmed
he
began
to
cry
out
do
believe
good
man
what
i
have
been
telling
you
i
know
pinocchio
very
well
and
i
can
assure
you
that
he
is
a
very
bad
boy
disobedient
and
idle
who
instead
of
going
to
school
runs
off
with
his
companions
to
amuse
himself
he
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
his
nose
became
shorter
and
returned
to
the
same
size
that
it
was
before
and
why
are
you
all
covered
with
white
asked
the
old
man
suddenly
i
will
tell
you
without
observing
it
i
rubbed
myself
against
a
wall
which
had
been
freshly
whitewashed
answered
the
puppet
ashamed
to
confess
that
he
had
been
floured
like
a
fish
prepared
for
the
and
what
have
you
done
with
your
jacket
your
trousers
and
your
cap
i
met
with
robbers
who
took
them
from
me
tell
me
good
old
man
could
you
perhaps
give
me
some
clothes
to
return
home
in
my
boy
as
to
clothes
i
have
nothing
but
a
little
sack
in
which
i
keep
beans
if
you
wish
for
it
take
it
there
it
is
pinocchio
did
not
wait
to
be
told
twice
he
took
the
sack
at
once
and
with
a
pair
of
scissors
he
cut
a
hole
at
the
end
and
at
each
side
and
put
it
on
like
a
shirt
and
with
this
slight
clothing
he
set
off
for
the
village
but
as
he
went
he
did
not
feel
at
all
comfortable
so
little
so
indeed
that
for
a
step
forward
he
took
another
backwards
and
he
said
talking
to
himself
how
shall
i
ever
present
myself
to
my
good
little
fairy
what
will
she
say
when
she
sees
me
will
she
forgive
me
this
second
escapade
oh
i
am
sure
that
she
will
not
forgive
me
and
it
serves
me
right
for
i
am
a
rascal
i
am
always
promising
to
correct
myself
and
i
never
keep
my
word
when
he
reached
the
village
it
was
night
and
very
dark
a
storm
had
come
on
and
as
the
rain
was
coming
down
in
torrents
he
went
straight
to
the
fairy
house
resolved
to
knock
at
the
door
but
when
he
was
there
his
courage
failed
him
and
instead
of
knocking
he
ran
away
some
twenty
paces
he
returned
to
the
door
a
second
time
and
laid
hold
of
the
knocker
and
trembling
gave
a
little
knock
he
waited
and
waited
at
last
after
half
an
hour
had
passed
a
window
on
the
top
floor
was
opened
the
house
was
four
stories
high
and
pinocchio
saw
a
big
snail
with
a
lighted
candle
on
her
head
looking
out
she
called
to
him
who
is
there
at
this
hour
is
the
fairy
at
home
asked
the
puppet
the
fairy
is
asleep
and
must
not
be
awakened
but
who
are
you
it
is
i
who
is
i
pinocchio
and
who
is
pinocchio
the
puppet
who
lives
in
the
fairy
house
ah
i
understand
said
the
snail
wait
for
me
there
i
will
come
down
and
open
the
door
directly
be
quick
for
pity
sake
for
i
am
dying
of
cold
my
boy
i
am
a
snail
and
snails
are
never
in
a
hurry
an
hour
passed
and
then
two
and
the
door
was
not
opened
pinocchio
who
was
wet
through
and
through
and
trembling
from
cold
and
fear
at
last
took
courage
and
knocked
again
and
this
time
he
knocked
louder
at
this
second
knock
a
window
on
the
lower
story
opened
and
the
same
snail
appeared
at
it
beautiful
little
snail
cried
pinocchio
from
the
street
i
have
been
waiting
for
two
hours
and
two
hours
on
such
a
bad
night
seem
longer
than
two
years
be
quick
for
pity
sake
my
boy
answered
the
calm
little
animal
my
boy
i
am
a
snail
and
snails
are
never
in
a
hurry
and
the
window
was
shut
again
shortly
afterwards
midnight
struck
then
one
then
two
and
the
door
remained
still
closed
pinocchio
at
last
losing
all
patience
seized
the
knocker
in
a
rage
intending
to
give
a
blow
that
would
resound
through
the
house
but
the
knocker
which
was
iron
turned
suddenly
into
an
eel
and
slipping
out
of
his
hands
disappeared
in
the
stream
of
water
that
ran
down
the
middle
of
the
street
ah
is
that
it
shouted
pinocchio
blind
with
rage
since
the
knocker
has
disappeared
i
will
kick
instead
with
all
my
might
and
drawing
a
little
back
he
gave
a
tremendous
kick
against
the
house
door
the
blow
was
indeed
so
violent
that
his
foot
went
through
the
wood
and
stuck
and
when
he
tried
to
draw
it
back
again
it
was
trouble
thrown
away
for
it
remained
fixed
like
a
nail
that
has
been
hammered
down
think
of
poor
pinocchio
he
was
obliged
to
spend
the
remainder
of
the
night
with
one
foot
on
the
ground
and
the
other
in
the
air
the
following
morning
at
daybreak
the
door
was
at
last
opened
the
clever
little
snail
had
taken
only
nine
hours
to
come
down
from
the
fourth
story
to
the
it
is
evident
that
her
exertions
must
have
been
great
what
are
you
doing
with
your
foot
stuck
in
the
door
she
asked
the
puppet
it
was
an
accident
do
try
beautiful
little
snail
if
you
can
not
release
me
from
this
torture
my
boy
that
is
the
work
of
a
carpenter
and
i
have
never
been
a
carpenter
beg
the
fairy
from
me
the
fairy
is
asleep
and
must
not
be
awakened
but
what
do
you
suppose
that
i
can
do
all
day
nailed
to
this
door
amuse
yourself
by
counting
the
ants
that
pass
down
the
street
bring
me
at
least
something
to
eat
for
i
am
quite
exhausted
at
once
said
the
snail
in
fact
after
three
hours
and
a
half
she
returned
to
pinocchio
carrying
a
silver
tray
on
her
head
the
tray
contained
a
loaf
of
bread
a
roast
chicken
and
four
ripe
apricots
here
is
the
breakfast
that
the
fairy
has
sent
you
said
the
snail
the
puppet
felt
very
much
comforted
at
the
sight
of
these
good
things
but
when
he
began
to
eat
them
what
was
his
disgust
at
making
the
discovery
that
the
bread
was
plaster
the
chicken
cardboard
and
the
four
apricots
painted
alabaster
he
wanted
to
cry
in
his
desperation
he
tried
to
throw
away
the
tray
and
all
that
was
on
it
but
instead
either
from
grief
or
exhaustion
he
fainted
away
when
he
came
to
himself
he
found
that
he
was
lying
on
a
sofa
and
the
fairy
was
beside
him
i
will
pardon
you
once
more
the
fairy
said
but
woe
to
you
if
you
behave
badly
a
third
time
pinocchio
promised
and
swore
that
he
would
study
and
that
for
the
future
he
would
always
conduct
himself
well
and
he
kept
his
word
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
indeed
at
the
examinations
before
the
holidays
he
had
the
honor
of
being
the
first
in
the
school
and
his
behavior
in
general
was
so
satisfactory
and
praiseworthy
that
the
fairy
was
very
much
pleased
and
said
to
him
tomorrow
your
wish
shall
be
gratified
and
that
is
tomorrow
you
shall
cease
to
be
a
wooden
puppet
and
you
shall
become
a
boy
no
one
who
had
not
witnessed
it
could
ever
imagine
pinocchio
joy
at
this
good
fortune
all
his
were
to
be
invited
for
the
following
day
to
a
grand
breakfast
at
the
fairy
house
that
they
might
celebrate
together
the
great
event
the
fairy
had
prepared
two
hundred
cups
of
coffee
and
milk
and
four
hundred
rolls
cut
and
buttered
on
each
side
the
day
promised
to
be
most
happy
and
delightful
but
unfortunately
in
the
lives
of
puppets
there
is
always
a
but
that
spoils
everything

the
land
of
boobies
pinocchio
as
was
natural
asked
the
fairy
permission
to
go
round
the
town
to
give
out
the
invitations
and
the
fairy
said
to
him
go
if
you
like
and
invite
your
companions
for
the
breakfast
tomorrow
but
remember
to
return
home
before
dark
have
you
understood
i
promise
to
be
back
in
an
hour
answered
the
puppet
take
care
pinocchio
boys
are
always
very
ready
to
promise
but
generally
they
are
little
given
to
keep
their
word
but
i
am
not
like
other
boys
when
i
say
a
thing
i
do
it
we
shall
see
if
you
are
disobedient
so
much
the
worse
for
you
why
because
boys
who
do
not
listen
to
the
advice
of
those
who
know
more
than
they
do
always
meet
with
some
misfortune
or
other
i
have
experienced
that
said
pinocchio
but
i
shall
never
make
that
mistake
again
we
shall
see
if
that
is
true
without
saying
more
the
puppet
took
leave
of
his
good
fairy
who
was
like
a
mamma
to
him
and
went
out
of
the
house
singing
and
dancing
in
less
than
an
hour
all
his
friends
were
invited
some
accepted
at
once
heartily
others
at
first
required
pressing
but
when
they
heard
that
the
rolls
to
be
eaten
with
the
coffee
were
to
be
buttered
on
both
sides
they
ended
by
saying
we
will
come
also
to
do
you
a
pleasure
now
i
must
tell
you
that
amongst
pinocchio
friends
and
there
was
one
that
he
greatly
preferred
and
was
very
fond
of
this
name
was
romeo
but
he
always
went
by
the
nickname
of
candlewick
because
he
was
so
thin
straight
and
bright
like
the
new
wick
of
a
little
nightlight
candlewick
was
the
laziest
and
the
naughtiest
boy
in
the
school
but
pinocchio
was
devoted
to
him
he
had
indeed
gone
at
once
to
his
house
to
invite
him
to
the
breakfast
but
he
had
not
found
him
he
returned
a
second
time
but
candlewick
was
not
there
he
went
a
third
time
but
it
was
in
vain
where
could
he
search
for
him
he
looked
here
there
and
everywhere
and
at
last
he
saw
him
hiding
on
the
porch
of
a
cottage
what
are
you
doing
there
asked
pinocchio
coming
up
to
him
i
am
waiting
for
midnight
to
start
away
and
where
are
you
going
i
am
going
to
live
in
a
country
the
most
delightful
country
in
the
world
a
real
land
of
sweetmeats
and
what
is
it
called
it
is
called
the
of
boobies
why
do
you
not
come
too
i
no
never
you
are
wrong
pinocchio
if
you
do
not
come
you
will
repent
it
where
could
you
find
a
better
country
for
us
boys
there
are
no
schools
there
there
are
no
masters
there
are
no
books
in
that
delightful
land
nobody
ever
studies
on
saturday
there
is
never
school
and
every
week
consists
of
six
saturdays
and
one
sunday
only
think
the
autumn
holidays
begin
on
the
first
of
january
and
finish
on
the
last
day
of
december
that
is
the
country
for
me
that
is
what
all
civilized
countries
should
be
like
but
how
are
the
days
spent
in
the
of
boobies
they
are
spent
in
play
and
amusement
from
morning
till
night
when
night
comes
you
go
to
bed
and
recommence
the
same
life
in
the
morning
what
do
you
think
of
it
hum
said
pinocchio
and
he
shook
his
head
slightly
as
much
as
to
say
that
is
a
life
that
i
also
would
willingly
lead
well
will
you
go
with
me
yes
or
no
resolve
quickly
no
no
no
and
again
no
i
promised
my
good
fairy
to
become
a
well
conducted
boy
and
i
will
keep
my
word
and
as
i
see
that
the
sun
is
setting
i
must
leave
you
at
once
and
run
away
and
a
pleasant
journey
to
you
where
are
you
rushing
off
to
in
such
a
hurry
home
my
good
fairy
wishes
me
to
be
back
before
dark
wait
another
two
minutes
it
will
make
me
too
late
only
two
minutes
and
if
the
fairy
scolds
me
let
her
scold
when
she
has
scolded
well
she
will
hold
her
tongue
said
that
rascal
candlewick
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
are
you
going
alone
or
with
companions
alone
indeed
not
there
will
be
more
than
a
hundred
boys
and
do
you
make
the
journey
on
foot
a
coach
will
pass
by
shortly
which
is
to
take
me
to
that
happy
country
what
would
i
not
give
for
the
coach
to
pass
by
now
why
that
i
might
see
you
all
start
together
stay
here
a
little
longer
and
you
will
see
us
no
no
i
must
go
home
wait
another
two
minutes
i
have
already
delayed
too
long
the
fairy
will
be
anxious
about
me
poor
fairy
is
she
afraid
that
the
bats
will
eat
you
but
now
continued
pinocchio
are
you
really
certain
that
there
are
no
schools
in
that
country
not
even
the
shadow
of
one
and
no
masters
either
not
one
and
no
one
is
ever
made
to
study
never
never
never
what
a
delightful
country
said
pinocchio
his
mouth
watering
what
a
delightful
country
i
have
never
been
there
but
i
can
quite
imagine
it
why
will
you
not
come
also
it
is
useless
to
tempt
me
i
promised
my
good
fairy
to
become
a
sensible
boy
and
i
will
not
break
my
word
then
and
give
my
compliments
to
all
the
boys
at
school
if
you
meet
them
in
the
street
candlewick
a
pleasant
journey
to
you
amuse
yourself
and
think
sometimes
of
your
friends
thus
saying
the
puppet
made
two
steps
to
go
but
then
stopped
and
turning
to
his
friend
he
inquired
but
are
you
quite
certain
that
in
that
country
all
the
weeks
consist
of
six
saturdays
and
one
sunday
most
certainly
but
do
you
know
for
certain
that
the
holidays
begin
on
the
first
of
january
and
finish
on
the
last
day
of
december
assuredly
what
a
delightful
country
repeated
pinocchio
looking
enchanted
then
with
a
resolute
air
he
added
in
a
great
hurry
this
time
really
and
a
pleasant
journey
to
you
when
do
you
start
shortly
what
a
pity
if
really
it
wanted
only
an
hour
to
the
time
of
your
start
i
should
almost
be
tempted
to
wait
and
the
fairy
it
is
already
late
if
i
return
home
an
hour
sooner
or
later
it
will
be
all
the
same
poor
pinocchio
and
if
the
fairy
scolds
you
i
must
have
patience
i
will
let
her
scold
when
she
has
scolded
well
she
will
hold
her
tongue
in
the
meantime
night
had
come
on
and
it
was
quite
dark
suddenly
they
saw
in
the
distance
a
small
light
moving
and
they
heard
a
noise
of
talking
and
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
but
so
small
and
feeble
that
it
resembled
the
hum
of
a
mosquito
here
it
is
shouted
candlewick
jumping
to
his
feet
what
is
it
asked
pinocchio
in
a
whisper
it
is
the
coach
coming
to
take
me
now
will
you
come
yes
or
no
but
is
it
really
true
asked
the
puppet
that
in
that
country
boys
are
never
obliged
to
study
never
never
never
what
a
delightful
country
what
a
delightful
country
what
a

pinocchio
enjoys
five
months
of
happiness
at
last
the
coach
arrived
and
it
arrived
without
making
the
slightest
noise
for
its
wheels
were
bound
round
with
flax
and
rags
it
was
drawn
by
twelve
pairs
of
donkeys
all
the
same
size
but
of
different
colors
some
were
gray
some
white
some
brindled
like
pepper
and
salt
and
others
had
large
stripes
of
yellow
and
blue
but
the
most
extraordinary
thing
was
this
the
twelve
pairs
that
is
the
donkeys
instead
of
being
shod
like
other
beasts
of
burden
had
on
their
feet
men
boots
made
of
white
kid
and
the
coachman
picture
to
yourself
a
little
man
broader
than
he
was
long
flabby
and
greasy
like
a
lump
of
butter
with
a
small
round
face
like
an
orange
a
little
mouth
that
was
always
laughing
and
a
soft
caressing
voice
like
a
cat
when
she
is
trying
to
insinuate
herself
into
the
good
graces
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
all
the
boys
vied
with
each
other
in
taking
places
in
his
coach
to
be
conducted
to
the
land
of
boobies
the
coach
was
in
fact
quite
full
of
boys
between
eight
and
fourteen
years
old
heaped
one
upon
another
like
herrings
in
a
barrel
they
were
uncomfortable
packed
closely
together
and
could
hardly
breathe
but
nobody
said
oh
nobody
grumbled
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
in
a
few
hours
they
would
reach
a
country
where
there
were
no
books
no
schools
and
no
masters
made
them
so
happy
and
resigned
that
they
felt
neither
fatigue
nor
inconvenience
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
nor
want
of
sleep
as
soon
as
the
coach
had
drawn
up
the
little
man
turned
to
candlewick
and
with
a
thousand
smirks
and
grimaces
said
to
him
smiling
tell
me
my
fine
boy
would
you
also
like
to
go
to
that
fortunate
country
i
certainly
wish
to
go
but
i
must
warn
you
my
dear
child
that
there
is
not
a
place
left
in
the
coach
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
it
is
quite
full
no
matter
replied
candlewick
if
there
is
no
place
inside
i
will
manage
to
sit
on
the
springs
and
giving
a
leap
he
seated
himself
astride
on
the
springs
and
you
my
love
said
the
little
man
turning
in
a
flattering
manner
to
pinocchio
what
do
you
intend
to
do
are
you
coming
with
us
or
are
you
going
to
remain
behind
i
remain
behind
answered
pinocchio
i
am
going
home
i
intend
to
study
as
all
well
conducted
boys
do
much
good
may
it
do
you
pinocchio
called
out
candlewick
listen
to
me
come
with
us
and
we
shall
have
such
fun
no
no
no
come
with
us
and
we
shall
have
such
fun
shouted
in
chorus
a
hundred
voices
from
the
inside
of
the
coach
but
if
i
come
with
you
what
will
my
good
fairy
say
said
the
puppet
who
was
beginning
to
yield
do
not
trouble
your
head
with
melancholy
thoughts
consider
only
that
we
are
going
to
a
country
where
we
shall
be
at
liberty
to
run
riot
from
morning
till
night
pinocchio
did
not
answer
but
he
sighed
he
sighed
again
he
sighed
for
the
third
time
and
he
said
finally
make
a
little
room
for
me
for
i
am
coming
too
the
places
are
all
full
replied
the
little
man
but
to
show
you
how
welcome
you
are
you
shall
have
my
seat
on
the
box
and
you
oh
i
will
go
on
foot
no
indeed
i
could
not
allow
that
i
would
rather
mount
one
of
these
donkeys
cried
pinocchio
approaching
the
donkey
of
the
first
pair
he
attempted
to
mount
him
but
the
animal
turned
on
him
and
giving
him
a
great
blow
in
the
stomach
rolled
him
over
with
his
legs
in
the
air
you
can
imagine
the
impertinent
and
immoderate
laughter
of
all
the
boys
who
witnessed
this
scene
but
the
little
man
did
not
laugh
he
approached
the
rebellious
donkey
and
pretending
to
give
him
a
kiss
bit
off
half
of
his
ear
pinocchio
in
the
meantime
had
gotten
up
from
the
ground
in
a
fury
and
with
a
spring
he
seated
himself
on
the
poor
animal
back
and
he
sprang
so
well
that
the
boys
stopped
laughing
and
began
to
shout
hurrah
pinocchio
and
they
clapped
their
hands
and
applauded
him
as
if
they
would
never
finish
now
that
pinocchio
was
mounted
the
coach
started
whilst
the
donkeys
were
galloping
and
the
coach
was
rattling
over
the
stones
of
the
high
road
the
puppet
thought
that
he
heard
a
low
voice
that
was
scarcely
audible
saying
to
him
poor
fool
you
would
follow
your
own
way
but
you
will
repent
it
pinocchio
feeling
almost
frightened
looked
from
side
to
side
to
try
and
discover
where
these
words
could
come
from
but
he
saw
nobody
the
donkeys
galloped
the
coach
rattled
the
boys
inside
slept
candlewick
snored
like
a
dormouse
and
the
little
man
seated
on
the
box
sang
between
his
teeth
during
the
night
all
sleep
but
i
sleep
never
after
they
had
gone
another
mile
pinocchio
heard
the
same
little
low
voice
saying
to
him
bear
it
in
mind
simpleton
boys
who
refuse
to
study
and
turn
their
backs
upon
books
schools
and
masters
to
pass
their
time
in
play
and
amusement
sooner
or
later
come
to
a
bad
end
i
know
it
by
experience
and
i
can
tell
you
a
day
will
come
when
you
will
weep
as
i
am
weeping
now
but
then
it
will
be
too
late
on
hearing
these
words
whispered
very
softly
the
puppet
more
frightened
than
ever
sprang
down
from
the
back
of
his
donkey
and
went
and
took
hold
of
his
mouth
imagine
his
surprise
when
he
found
that
the
donkey
was
crying
crying
like
a
boy
eh
sir
coachman
cried
pinocchio
to
the
little
man
here
is
an
extraordinary
thing
this
donkey
is
crying
let
him
cry
he
will
laugh
when
he
is
a
bridegroom
but
have
you
by
chance
taught
him
to
talk
no
but
he
spent
three
years
in
a
company
of
learned
dogs
and
he
learned
to
mutter
a
few
words
poor
beast
come
come
said
the
little
man
do
let
us
waste
time
in
seeing
a
donkey
cry
mount
him
and
let
us
go
on
the
night
is
cold
and
the
road
is
long
pinocchio
obeyed
without
another
word
in
the
morning
about
daybreak
they
arrived
safely
in
the
land
of
boobies
it
was
a
country
unlike
any
other
country
in
the
world
the
population
was
composed
entirely
of
boys
the
oldest
were
fourteen
and
the
youngest
scarcely
eight
years
old
in
the
streets
there
was
such
merriment
noise
and
shouting
that
it
was
enough
to
turn
anybody
head
there
were
troops
of
boys
everywhere
some
were
playing
with
nuts
some
with
battledores
some
with
balls
some
rode
velocipedes
others
wooden
horses
a
party
were
playing
at
hide
and
seek
a
few
were
chasing
each
other
some
were
reciting
some
singing
some
leaping
some
were
amusing
themselves
with
walking
on
their
hands
with
their
feet
in
the
air
others
were
trundling
hoops
or
strutting
about
dressed
as
generals
wearing
leaf
helmets
and
commanding
a
squadron
of
cardboard
soldiers
some
were
laughing
some
shouting
some
were
calling
out
others
clapped
their
hands
or
whistled
or
clucked
like
a
hen
who
has
just
laid
an
egg
in
every
square
canvas
theaters
had
been
erected
and
they
were
crowded
with
boys
from
morning
till
evening
on
the
walls
of
the
houses
there
were
inscriptions
written
in
charcoal
long
live
playthings
we
will
have
no
more
schools
down
with
arithmetic
and
similar
other
fine
sentiments
all
in
bad
spelling
pinocchio
candlewick
and
the
other
boys
who
had
made
the
journey
with
the
little
man
had
scarcely
set
foot
in
the
town
before
they
were
in
the
thick
of
the
tumult
and
i
need
not
tell
you
that
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
made
acquaintance
with
everybody
where
could
happier
or
more
contented
boys
be
found
in
the
midst
of
continual
games
and
every
variety
of
amusement
the
hours
the
days
and
the
weeks
passed
like
lightning
oh
what
a
delightful
life
said
pinocchio
whenever
by
chance
he
met
candlewick
see
then
if
i
was
not
right
replied
the
other
and
to
think
that
you
did
not
want
to
come
to
think
that
you
had
taken
it
into
your
head
to
return
home
to
your
fairy
and
to
lose
your
time
in
studying
if
you
are
this
moment
free
from
the
bother
of
books
and
school
you
must
acknowledge
that
you
owe
it
to
me
to
my
advice
and
to
my
persuasions
it
is
only
friends
who
know
how
to
render
such
great
services
it
is
true
candlewick
if
i
am
now
a
really
happy
boy
it
is
all
your
doing
but
do
you
know
what
the
master
used
to
say
when
he
talked
to
me
of
you
he
always
said
to
me
not
associate
with
that
rascal
candlewick
for
he
is
a
bad
companion
and
will
only
lead
you
into
mischief
poor
master
replied
the
other
shaking
his
head
i
know
only
too
well
that
he
disliked
me
and
amused
himself
by
calumniating
me
but
i
am
generous
and
i
forgive
him
noble
soul
said
pinocchio
embracing
his
friend
affectionately
and
kissing
him
between
the
eyes
this
delightful
life
had
gone
on
for
five
months
the
days
had
been
entirely
spent
in
play
and
amusement
without
a
thought
of
books
or
school
when
one
morning
pinocchio
awoke
to
a
most
disagreeable
surprise
that
put
him
into
a
very
bad
humor
illustration
chapter
xxxii
pinocchio
turns
into
a
donkey
the
surprise
was
that
pinocchio
when
he
awoke
scratched
his
head
and
in
scratching
his
head
he
discovered
to
his
great
astonishment
that
his
ears
had
grown
more
than
a
hand
you
know
that
the
puppet
from
his
birth
had
always
had
very
small
ears
so
small
that
they
were
not
visible
to
the
naked
eye
you
can
imagine
then
what
he
felt
when
he
found
that
during
the
night
his
ears
had
become
so
long
that
they
seemed
like
two
brooms
he
went
at
once
in
search
of
a
glass
that
he
might
look
at
himself
but
not
being
able
to
find
one
he
filled
the
basin
of
his
with
water
and
he
saw
reflected
what
he
certainly
would
never
have
wished
to
see
he
saw
his
head
embellished
with
a
magnificent
pair
of
donkey
ears
only
think
of
poor
pinocchio
sorrow
shame
and
despair
he
began
to
cry
and
roar
and
he
beat
his
head
against
the
wall
but
the
more
he
cried
the
longer
his
ears
grew
they
grew
and
grew
and
became
hairy
towards
the
points
at
the
sound
of
his
loud
outcries
a
beautiful
little
marmot
that
lived
on
the
first
floor
came
into
the
room
seeing
the
puppet
in
such
grief
she
asked
earnestly
what
has
happened
to
you
my
dear
i
am
ill
my
dear
little
marmot
very
ill
and
my
illness
frightens
me
do
you
understand
counting
a
pulse
a
little
then
feel
and
see
if
by
chance
i
have
got
fever
the
little
marmot
raised
her
right
and
after
having
felt
pinocchio
pulse
she
said
to
him
sighing
my
friend
i
am
grieved
to
be
obliged
to
give
you
bad
news
what
is
it
you
have
got
a
very
bad
fever
what
fever
is
it
it
is
donkey
fever
that
is
a
fever
that
i
do
not
understand
said
the
puppet
but
he
understood
it
only
too
well
then
i
will
explain
it
to
you
said
the
marmot
you
must
know
that
in
two
or
three
hours
you
will
be
no
longer
a
puppet
or
a
boy
then
what
shall
i
be
in
two
or
three
hours
you
will
become
really
and
truly
a
little
donkey
like
those
that
draw
carts
and
carry
cabbages
and
salad
to
market
oh
unfortunate
that
i
am
unfortunate
that
i
am
cried
pinocchio
seizing
his
two
ears
with
his
hands
and
pulling
them
and
tearing
them
furiously
as
if
they
had
been
some
one
else
ears
my
dear
boy
said
the
marmot
by
way
of
consoling
him
you
can
do
nothing
it
is
destiny
it
is
written
in
the
decrees
of
wisdom
that
all
boys
who
are
lazy
and
who
take
a
dislike
to
books
to
schools
and
to
masters
and
who
pass
their
time
in
amusement
games
and
diversions
must
end
sooner
or
later
by
becoming
transformed
into
so
many
little
donkeys
but
is
it
really
so
asked
the
puppet
sobbing
it
is
indeed
only
too
true
and
tears
are
now
useless
you
should
have
thought
of
it
sooner
but
it
was
not
my
fault
believe
me
little
marmot
the
fault
was
all
candlewick
and
who
is
this
candlewick
one
of
my
i
wanted
to
return
home
i
wanted
to
be
obedient
i
wished
to
study
but
candlewick
said
to
me
should
you
bother
yourself
by
studying
why
should
you
go
to
school
come
with
us
instead
to
the
land
of
boobies
there
we
shall
none
of
us
have
to
learn
there
we
shall
amuse
ourselves
from
morning
to
night
and
we
shall
always
be
merry
and
why
did
you
follow
the
advice
of
that
false
friend
of
that
bad
companion
why
because
my
dear
little
marmot
i
am
a
puppet
with
no
sense
and
with
no
heart
ah
if
i
had
had
the
least
heart
i
should
never
have
left
that
good
fairy
who
loved
me
like
a
mamma
and
who
had
done
so
much
for
me
and
i
would
be
no
longer
a
puppet
for
i
would
by
this
time
have
become
a
little
boy
like
so
many
others
but
if
i
meet
candlewick
woe
to
him
he
shall
hear
what
i
think
of
him
and
he
turned
to
go
out
but
when
he
reached
the
door
he
remembered
his
donkey
ears
and
feeling
ashamed
to
show
them
in
public
what
do
you
think
he
did
he
took
a
big
cotton
cap
and
putting
it
on
his
head
he
pulled
it
well
down
over
the
point
of
his
nose
he
then
set
out
and
went
everywhere
in
search
of
candlewick
he
looked
for
him
in
the
streets
in
the
squares
in
the
little
theaters
in
every
possible
place
but
he
could
not
find
him
he
inquired
for
him
of
everybody
he
met
but
no
one
had
seen
him
he
then
went
to
seek
him
at
his
house
and
having
reached
the
door
he
knocked
who
is
there
asked
candlewick
from
within
it
is
i
answered
the
puppet
wait
a
moment
and
i
will
let
you
in
after
half
an
hour
the
door
was
opened
and
imagine
pinocchio
feelings
when
upon
going
into
the
room
he
saw
his
friend
candlewick
with
a
big
cotton
cap
on
his
head
which
came
down
over
his
nose
at
the
sight
of
the
cap
pinocchio
felt
almost
consoled
and
thought
to
himself
has
my
friend
got
the
same
illness
that
i
have
is
he
also
suffering
from
donkey
fever
and
pretending
to
have
observed
nothing
he
asked
him
smiling
how
are
you
my
dear
candlewick
very
well
as
well
as
a
mouse
in
a
parmesan
cheese
are
you
saying
that
seriously
why
should
i
tell
you
a
lie
excuse
me
but
why
then
do
you
keep
that
cotton
cap
on
your
head
which
covers
up
your
ears
the
doctor
ordered
me
to
wear
it
because
i
have
hurt
this
knee
and
you
dear
puppet
why
have
you
got
on
that
cotton
cap
pulled
down
over
your
nose
the
doctor
prescribed
it
because
i
have
grazed
my
foot
oh
poor
pinocchio
oh
poor
candlewick
after
these
words
a
long
silence
followed
during
which
the
two
friends
did
nothing
but
look
mockingly
at
each
other
at
last
the
puppet
said
in
a
soft
voice
to
his
companion
satisfy
my
curiosity
my
dear
candlewick
have
you
ever
suffered
from
disease
of
the
ears
never
and
you
never
only
since
this
morning
one
of
my
ears
aches
mine
is
also
paining
me
you
also
and
which
of
your
ears
hurts
you
both
of
them
and
you
both
of
them
can
we
have
got
the
same
illness
i
fear
so
will
you
do
me
a
kindness
candlewick
willingly
with
all
my
heart
will
you
let
me
see
your
ears
why
not
but
first
my
dear
pinocchio
i
should
like
to
see
yours
no
you
must
be
first
no
dear
first
you
and
then
i
well
said
the
puppet
let
us
come
to
an
agreement
like
good
friends
let
us
hear
it
we
will
both
take
off
our
caps
at
the
same
moment
do
you
agree
i
agree
then
attention
and
pinocchio
began
to
count
in
a
loud
voice
one
two
three
at
the
word
three
the
two
boys
took
off
their
caps
and
threw
them
into
the
air
and
then
a
scene
followed
that
would
seem
incredible
if
it
were
not
true
that
is
that
when
pinocchio
and
candlewick
discovered
that
they
were
both
struck
with
the
same
misfortune
instead
of
feeling
full
of
mortification
and
grief
they
began
to
prick
their
ungainly
ears
and
to
make
a
thousand
antics
and
they
ended
by
going
into
bursts
of
laughter
and
they
laughed
and
laughed
and
laughed
until
they
had
to
hold
themselves
together
but
in
the
midst
of
their
merriment
candlewick
suddenly
stopped
staggered
and
changing
color
said
to
his
friend
help
help
pinocchio
what
is
the
matter
with
you
alas
i
can
not
any
longer
stand
upright
neither
can
i
exclaimed
pinocchio
tottering
and
beginning
to
cry
and
whilst
they
were
talking
they
both
doubled
up
and
began
to
run
round
the
room
on
their
hands
and
feet
and
as
they
ran
their
hands
became
hoofs
their
faces
lengthened
into
muzzles
and
their
backs
became
covered
with
a
light
gray
hairy
coat
sprinkled
with
black
but
do
you
know
what
was
the
worst
moment
for
these
two
wretched
boys
the
worst
and
the
most
humiliating
moment
was
when
their
tails
grew
vanquished
by
shame
and
sorrow
they
wept
and
lamented
their
fate
oh
if
they
had
but
been
wiser
but
instead
of
sighs
and
lamentations
they
could
only
bray
like
asses
and
they
brayed
loudly
and
said
in
chorus
whilst
this
was
going
on
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
and
a
voice
on
the
outside
said
open
the
door
i
am
the
little
man
i
am
the
coachman
who
brought
you
to
this
country
open
at
once
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
illustration
chapter
xxxiii
pinocchio
is
trained
for
the
circus
finding
that
the
door
remained
shut
the
little
man
burst
it
open
with
a
violent
kick
and
coming
into
the
room
he
said
to
pinocchio
and
candlewick
with
his
usual
little
laugh
well
done
boys
you
brayed
well
and
i
recognized
you
by
your
voices
that
is
why
i
am
here
at
these
words
the
two
little
donkeys
were
quite
stupefied
and
stood
with
their
heads
down
their
ears
lowered
and
their
tails
between
their
legs
at
first
the
little
man
stroked
and
caressed
them
then
taking
out
a
currycomb
he
currycombed
them
well
and
when
by
this
process
he
had
polished
them
till
they
shone
like
two
mirrors
he
put
a
halter
round
their
necks
and
led
them
to
the
in
hopes
of
selling
them
and
making
a
good
profit
and
indeed
buyers
were
not
wanting
candlewick
was
bought
by
a
peasant
whose
donkey
had
died
the
previous
day
pinocchio
was
sold
to
the
director
of
a
company
of
buffoons
and
dancers
who
bought
him
that
he
might
teach
him
to
leap
and
to
dance
with
the
other
animals
belonging
to
the
company
and
now
my
little
readers
you
will
have
understood
the
fine
trade
that
little
man
pursued
the
wicked
little
monster
who
had
a
face
all
milk
and
honey
made
frequent
journeys
round
the
world
with
his
coach
as
he
went
along
he
collected
with
promises
and
flattery
all
the
idle
boys
who
had
taken
a
dislike
to
books
and
school
as
soon
as
his
coach
was
full
he
conducted
them
to
the
land
of
boobies
that
they
might
pass
their
time
in
games
in
uproar
and
in
amusement
when
these
poor
deluded
boys
from
continual
play
and
no
study
had
become
so
many
little
donkeys
he
took
possession
of
them
with
great
delight
and
satisfaction
and
carried
them
off
to
the
fairs
and
markets
to
be
sold
and
in
this
way
he
had
in
a
few
years
made
heaps
of
money
and
had
become
a
millionaire
what
became
of
candlewick
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
know
that
pinocchio
from
the
very
first
day
had
to
endure
a
very
hard
laborious
life
when
he
was
put
into
his
stall
his
master
filled
the
manger
with
straw
but
pinocchio
having
tried
a
mouthful
spat
it
out
again
then
his
master
grumbling
filled
the
manger
with
hay
but
neither
did
the
hay
please
him
ah
exclaimed
his
master
in
a
passion
does
not
hay
please
you
either
leave
it
to
me
my
fine
donkey
if
you
are
so
full
of
caprices
i
will
find
a
way
to
cure
you
and
by
way
of
correcting
him
he
struck
his
legs
with
his
whip
pinocchio
began
to
cry
and
to
bray
with
pain
and
he
said
braying
i
can
not
digest
straw
then
eat
hay
said
his
master
who
understood
perfectly
the
asinine
dialect
hay
gives
me
a
pain
in
my
stomach
do
you
mean
to
pretend
that
a
little
donkey
like
you
must
be
kept
on
breasts
of
chickens
and
capons
in
jelly
asked
his
master
getting
more
and
more
angry
and
whipping
him
again
at
this
second
whipping
pinocchio
prudently
held
his
tongue
and
said
nothing
more
the
stable
was
then
shut
and
pinocchio
was
left
alone
he
had
not
eaten
for
many
hours
and
he
began
to
yawn
from
hunger
and
when
he
yawned
he
opened
a
mouth
that
seemed
as
wide
as
an
oven
at
last
finding
nothing
else
in
the
manger
he
resigned
himself
and
chewed
a
little
hay
and
after
he
had
chewed
it
well
he
shut
his
eyes
and
swallowed
it
this
hay
is
not
bad
he
said
to
himself
but
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
if
i
had
gone
on
with
my
studies
instead
of
hay
i
might
now
be
eating
a
hunch
of
new
bread
and
a
fine
slice
of
sausage
but
i
must
have
patience
the
next
morning
when
he
woke
he
looked
in
the
manger
for
a
little
more
hay
but
he
found
none
for
he
had
eaten
it
all
during
the
night
then
he
took
a
mouthful
of
chopped
straw
but
whilst
he
was
chewing
it
he
had
to
acknowledge
that
the
taste
of
chopped
straw
did
not
in
the
least
resemble
a
savory
dish
of
macaroni
or
pie
but
i
must
have
patience
he
repeated
as
he
went
on
chewing
may
my
example
serve
at
least
as
a
warning
to
all
disobedient
boys
who
do
not
want
to
study
patience
patience
indeed
shouted
his
master
coming
at
that
moment
into
the
stable
do
you
think
my
little
donkey
that
i
bought
you
only
to
give
you
food
and
drink
i
bought
you
to
make
you
work
and
that
you
might
earn
money
for
me
up
then
at
once
you
must
come
with
me
into
the
circus
and
there
i
will
teach
you
to
jump
through
hoops
to
go
through
frames
of
paper
head
foremost
to
dance
waltzes
and
polkas
and
to
stand
upright
on
your
hind
legs
poor
pinocchio
either
by
love
or
by
force
had
to
learn
all
these
fine
things
but
it
took
him
three
months
before
he
had
learned
them
and
he
got
many
a
whipping
that
nearly
took
off
his
skin
at
last
a
day
came
when
his
master
was
able
to
announce
that
he
would
give
a
really
extraordinary
representation
the
many
colored
placards
stuck
on
the
street
corners
were
thus
worded
great
full
dress
representation
tonight
will
take
place
the
usual
feats
and
surprising
performances
executed
by
all
the
artists
and
by
all
the
horses
of
the
company
and
moreover
the
famous
little
donkey
pinocchio
called
the
star
of
the
dance
will
make
his
first
appearance
the
theater
will
be
brilliantly
illuminated
illustration
in
less
than
an
hour
all
his
friends
were
invited
on
that
evening
as
you
may
imagine
an
hour
before
the
play
was
to
begin
the
theater
was
crammed
there
was
not
a
place
to
be
had
either
in
the
pit
or
the
stalls
or
in
the
boxes
even
by
paying
its
weight
in
gold
the
benches
round
the
circus
were
crowded
with
children
and
with
boys
of
all
ages
who
were
in
a
fever
of
impatience
to
see
the
famous
little
donkey
pinocchio
dance
when
the
first
part
of
the
performance
was
over
the
director
of
the
company
dressed
in
a
black
coat
white
breeches
and
big
leather
boots
that
came
above
his
knees
presented
himself
to
the
public
and
after
making
a
profound
bow
he
began
with
much
solemnity
the
following
ridiculous
speech
respectable
public
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
humble
undersigned
being
a
in
this
illustrious
city
i
have
wished
to
procure
for
myself
the
honor
not
to
say
the
pleasure
of
presenting
to
this
intelligent
and
distinguished
audience
a
celebrated
little
donkey
who
has
already
had
the
honor
of
dancing
in
the
presence
of
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
all
the
principal
courts
of
europe
and
thanking
you
i
beg
of
you
to
help
us
with
your
inspiring
presence
and
to
be
indulgent
to
us
this
speech
was
received
with
much
laughter
and
applause
but
the
applause
redoubled
and
became
tumultuous
when
the
little
donkey
pinocchio
made
his
appearance
in
the
middle
of
the
circus
he
was
decked
out
for
the
occasion
he
had
a
new
bridle
of
polished
leather
with
brass
buckles
and
studs
and
two
white
camelias
in
his
ears
his
mane
was
divided
and
curled
and
each
curl
was
tied
with
bows
of
colored
ribbon
he
had
a
girth
of
gold
and
silver
round
his
body
and
his
tail
was
plaited
with
amaranth
and
blue
velvet
ribbons
he
was
in
fact
a
little
donkey
to
fall
in
love
with
the
director
in
presenting
him
to
the
public
added
these
few
words
my
respectable
auditors
i
am
not
here
to
tell
you
falsehoods
of
the
great
difficulties
that
i
have
overcome
in
understanding
and
subjugating
this
mammifer
whilst
he
was
grazing
at
liberty
amongst
the
mountains
in
the
plains
of
the
torrid
zone
i
beg
you
will
observe
the
wild
rolling
of
his
eyes
every
means
having
been
tried
in
vain
to
tame
him
and
to
accustom
him
to
the
life
of
domestic
quadrupeds
i
was
often
forced
to
have
recourse
to
the
convincing
argument
of
the
whip
but
all
my
goodness
to
him
instead
of
gaining
his
affections
has
on
the
contrary
increased
his
viciousness
however
following
the
system
of
gall
i
discovered
in
his
cranium
a
bony
cartilage
that
the
faculty
of
medicine
of
paris
has
itself
recognized
as
the
regenerating
bulb
of
the
hair
and
of
dance
for
this
reason
i
have
not
only
taught
him
to
dance
but
also
to
jump
through
hoops
and
through
frames
covered
with
paper
admire
him
and
then
pass
your
opinion
on
him
but
before
taking
my
leave
of
you
permit
me
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
invite
you
to
the
daily
performance
that
will
take
place
tomorrow
evening
but
in
case
the
weather
should
threaten
rain
the
performance
will
be
postponed
till
tomorrow
morning
at
of
here
the
director
made
another
profound
bow
and
then
turning
to
pinocchio
he
said
courage
pinocchio
before
you
begin
your
feats
make
your
bow
to
this
distinguished
audience
ladies
gentlemen
and
children
pinocchio
obeyed
and
bent
both
his
knees
till
they
touched
the
ground
and
remained
kneeling
until
the
director
cracking
his
whip
shouted
to
him
at
a
foot
pace
then
the
little
donkey
raised
himself
on
his
four
legs
and
began
to
walk
round
the
theater
keeping
at
a
foot
pace
after
a
little
the
director
cried
trot
and
pinocchio
obeying
the
order
changed
to
a
trot
gallop
and
pinocchio
broke
into
a
gallop
full
gallop
and
pinocchio
went
full
gallop
but
whilst
he
was
going
full
speed
like
a
race
horse
the
director
raising
his
arm
in
the
air
fired
off
a
pistol
at
the
shot
the
little
donkey
pretending
to
be
wounded
fell
his
whole
length
in
the
circus
as
if
he
were
really
dying
as
he
got
up
from
the
ground
amidst
an
outburst
of
applause
shouts
and
clapping
of
hands
he
naturally
raised
his
head
and
looked
up
and
he
saw
in
one
of
the
boxes
a
beautiful
lady
who
wore
round
her
neck
a
thick
gold
chain
from
which
hung
a
medallion
on
the
medallion
was
painted
the
portrait
of
a
puppet
that
is
my
portrait
that
lady
is
the
fairy
said
pinocchio
to
himself
recognizing
her
immediately
and
overcome
with
delight
he
tried
to
cry
oh
my
little
fairy
oh
my
little
fairy
but
instead
of
these
words
a
bray
came
from
his
throat
so
sonorous
and
so
prolonged
that
all
the
spectators
laughed
and
more
especially
all
the
children
who
were
in
the
theater
then
the
director
to
give
him
a
lesson
and
to
make
him
understand
that
it
is
not
good
manners
to
bray
before
the
public
gave
him
a
blow
on
his
nose
with
the
handle
of
his
whip
the
poor
little
donkey
put
his
tongue
out
an
inch
and
licked
his
nose
for
at
least
five
minutes
thinking
perhaps
that
it
would
ease
the
pain
he
felt
but
what
was
his
despair
when
looking
up
a
second
time
he
saw
that
the
box
was
empty
and
that
the
fairy
had
disappeared
he
thought
he
was
going
to
die
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
he
began
to
weep
nobody
however
noticed
it
and
least
of
all
the
director
who
cracking
his
whip
shouted
courage
pinocchio
now
let
the
audience
see
how
gracefully
you
can
jump
through
the
hoops
pinocchio
tried
two
or
three
times
but
each
time
that
he
came
in
front
of
the
hoop
instead
of
going
through
it
he
found
it
easier
to
go
under
it
at
last
he
made
a
leap
and
went
through
it
but
his
right
leg
unfortunately
caught
in
the
hoop
and
that
caused
him
to
fall
to
the
ground
doubled
up
in
a
heap
on
the
other
side
when
he
got
up
he
was
lame
and
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
that
he
managed
to
return
to
the
stable
bring
out
pinocchio
we
want
the
little
donkey
bring
out
the
little
donkey
shouted
all
the
boys
in
the
theater
touched
and
sorry
for
the
sad
accident
but
the
little
donkey
was
seen
no
more
that
evening
the
following
morning
the
veterinary
that
is
the
doctor
of
animals
paid
him
a
visit
and
declared
that
he
would
remain
lame
for
life
the
director
then
said
to
the
what
do
you
suppose
i
can
do
with
a
lame
donkey
he
would
eat
food
without
earning
it
take
him
to
the
market
and
sell
him
when
they
reached
the
market
a
purchaser
was
found
at
once
he
asked
the
how
much
do
you
want
for
that
lame
donkey
twenty
dollars
i
will
give
you
two
dollars
do
suppose
that
i
am
buying
him
to
make
use
of
i
am
buying
him
solely
for
his
skin
i
see
that
his
skin
is
very
hard
and
i
intend
to
make
a
drum
with
it
for
the
band
of
my
village
imagine
poor
pinocchio
feelings
when
he
heard
that
he
was
destined
to
become
a
drum
as
soon
as
the
purchaser
had
paid
his
two
dollars
he
conducted
the
little
donkey
to
the
seashore
he
then
put
a
stone
round
his
neck
and
tying
a
rope
the
end
of
which
he
held
in
his
hand
round
his
leg
he
gave
him
a
sudden
push
and
threw
him
into
the
water
pinocchio
weighted
down
by
the
stone
went
at
once
to
the
bottom
and
his
owner
keeping
tight
hold
of
the
cord
sat
down
quietly
on
a
piece
of
rock
to
wait
until
the
little
donkey
was
drowned
intending
then
to
skin
him

pinocchio
is
swallowed
by
the
after
pinocchio
had
been
fifty
minutes
under
the
water
his
purchaser
said
aloud
to
himself
my
poor
little
lame
donkey
must
by
this
time
be
quite
drowned
i
will
therefore
pull
him
out
of
the
water
and
i
will
make
a
fine
drum
of
his
skin
and
he
began
to
haul
in
the
rope
that
he
had
tied
to
the
donkey
leg
and
he
hauled
and
hauled
and
hauled
until
at
last
what
do
you
think
appeared
above
the
water
instead
of
a
little
dead
donkey
he
saw
a
live
puppet
who
was
wriggling
like
an
eel
seeing
this
wooden
puppet
the
poor
man
thought
he
was
dreaming
and
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
he
remained
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
having
somewhat
recovered
from
his
first
stupefaction
he
asked
in
a
quavering
voice
and
the
little
donkey
that
i
threw
into
the
sea
what
has
become
of
him
i
am
the
little
donkey
said
pinocchio
laughing
you
i
ah
you
young
scamp
do
you
dare
to
make
game
of
me
to
make
game
of
you
quite
the
contrary
my
dear
master
i
am
speaking
seriously
but
how
can
you
who
but
a
short
time
ago
were
a
little
donkey
have
become
a
wooden
puppet
only
from
having
been
left
in
the
water
it
must
have
been
the
effect
of
sea
water
the
sea
makes
extraordinary
changes
beware
puppet
beware
do
imagine
that
you
can
amuse
yourself
at
my
expense
woe
to
you
if
i
lose
patience
well
master
do
you
wish
to
know
the
true
story
if
you
will
set
my
leg
free
i
will
tell
it
you
the
good
man
who
was
curious
to
hear
the
true
story
immediately
untied
the
knot
that
kept
him
bound
and
pinocchio
finding
himself
free
as
a
bird
in
the
air
commenced
as
follows
you
must
know
that
i
was
once
a
puppet
as
i
am
now
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
becoming
a
boy
like
the
many
who
are
in
the
world
but
instead
induced
by
my
dislike
for
study
and
the
advice
of
bad
companions
i
ran
away
from
home
one
fine
day
when
i
awoke
i
found
myself
changed
into
a
donkey
with
long
ears
and
a
long
tail
what
a
disgrace
it
was
to
me
a
disgrace
dear
master
that
even
your
worst
enemy
would
not
inflict
upon
you
taken
to
the
market
to
be
sold
i
was
bought
by
the
director
of
an
equestrian
company
who
took
it
into
his
head
to
make
a
famous
dancer
of
me
and
a
famous
leaper
through
hoops
but
one
night
during
a
performance
i
had
a
bad
fall
in
the
circus
and
lamed
both
my
legs
then
the
director
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
a
lame
donkey
sent
me
to
be
sold
and
you
were
the
purchaser
only
too
true
and
i
paid
two
dollars
for
you
and
now
who
will
give
me
back
my
good
money
and
why
did
you
buy
me
you
bought
me
to
make
a
drum
of
my
skin
only
too
true
and
now
where
shall
i
find
another
skin
do
despair
master
there
are
such
a
number
of
little
donkeys
in
the
world
tell
me
you
impertinent
rascal
does
your
story
end
here
no
answered
the
puppet
i
have
another
two
words
to
say
and
then
i
shall
have
finished
after
you
had
bought
me
you
brought
me
to
this
place
to
kill
me
but
then
yielding
to
a
feeling
of
compassion
you
preferred
to
tie
a
stone
round
my
neck
and
to
throw
me
into
the
sea
this
humane
feeling
does
you
great
honor
and
i
shall
always
be
grateful
to
you
for
it
but
nevertheless
dear
master
this
time
you
made
your
calculations
without
considering
the
fairy
and
who
is
the
fairy
she
is
my
mamma
and
she
resembles
all
other
good
mammas
who
care
for
their
children
and
who
never
lose
sight
of
them
but
help
them
lovingly
even
when
on
account
of
their
foolishness
and
evil
conduct
they
deserve
to
be
abandoned
and
left
to
themselves
well
then
the
good
fairy
as
soon
as
she
saw
that
i
was
in
danger
of
drowning
sent
immediately
an
immense
shoal
of
fish
who
believing
me
really
to
be
a
little
dead
donkey
began
to
eat
me
and
what
mouthfuls
they
took
i
should
never
have
thought
that
fish
were
greedier
than
boys
some
ate
my
ears
some
my
muzzle
others
my
neck
and
mane
some
the
skin
of
my
legs
some
my
coat
amongst
them
there
was
a
little
fish
so
polite
that
he
even
condescended
to
eat
my
tail
from
this
time
forth
said
his
purchaser
horrified
i
swear
that
i
will
never
touch
fish
it
would
be
too
dreadful
to
open
a
mullet
or
a
fried
whiting
and
to
find
inside
a
donkey
tail
i
agree
with
you
said
the
puppet
laughing
however
i
must
tell
you
that
when
the
fish
had
finished
eating
the
donkey
hide
that
covered
me
from
head
to
foot
they
naturally
reached
the
bone
or
rather
the
wood
for
as
you
see
i
am
made
of
the
hardest
wood
but
after
giving
a
few
bites
they
soon
discovered
that
i
was
not
a
morsel
for
their
teeth
and
disgusted
with
such
indigestible
food
they
went
off
some
in
one
direction
and
some
in
another
without
so
much
as
saying
you
to
me
and
now
at
last
i
have
told
you
how
it
was
that
when
you
pulled
up
the
rope
you
found
a
live
puppet
instead
of
a
dead
donkey
i
laugh
at
your
story
cried
the
man
in
a
rage
i
know
only
that
i
spent
two
dollars
to
buy
you
and
i
will
have
my
money
back
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
take
you
back
to
the
market
and
i
will
sell
you
by
weight
as
seasoned
wood
for
lighting
fires
sell
me
if
you
like
i
am
content
said
pinocchio
but
as
he
said
it
he
made
a
spring
and
plunged
into
the
water
swimming
gaily
away
from
the
shore
he
called
to
his
poor
owner
master
if
you
should
be
in
want
of
a
skin
to
make
a
drum
remember
me
and
he
laughed
and
went
on
swimming
and
after
a
while
he
turned
again
and
shouted
louder
master
if
you
should
be
in
want
of
a
little
well
seasoned
wood
for
lighting
the
fire
remember
me
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
he
had
swum
so
far
off
that
he
was
scarcely
visible
all
that
could
be
seen
of
him
was
a
little
black
speck
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
that
from
time
to
time
lifted
its
legs
out
of
the
water
and
leaped
and
capered
like
a
dolphin
enjoying
himself
whilst
pinocchio
was
swimming
he
knew
not
whither
he
saw
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
a
rock
that
seemed
to
be
made
of
white
marble
and
on
the
summit
there
stood
a
beautiful
little
goat
who
bleated
lovingly
and
made
signs
to
him
to
approach
but
the
most
singular
thing
was
this
the
little
goat
hair
instead
of
being
white
or
black
or
a
mixture
of
two
colors
as
is
usual
with
other
goats
was
blue
and
a
very
vivid
blue
greatly
resembling
the
hair
of
the
beautiful
child
i
leave
you
to
imagine
how
rapidly
poor
pinocchio
heart
began
to
beat
he
swam
with
redoubled
strength
and
energy
towards
the
white
rock
and
he
was
already
there
when
he
saw
rising
up
out
of
the
water
and
coming
to
meet
him
the
horrible
head
of
a
his
cavernous
mouth
and
his
three
rows
of
enormous
teeth
would
have
been
terrifying
to
look
at
even
in
a
picture
and
do
you
know
what
this
was
this
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
that
gigantic
who
has
been
mentioned
many
times
in
this
story
and
who
for
his
slaughter
and
for
his
insatiable
voracity
had
been
named
the
attila
of
fish
and
fishermen
only
to
think
of
poor
pinocchio
terror
at
the
sight
of
the
monster
he
tried
to
avoid
it
to
change
his
direction
he
tried
to
escape
but
that
immense
mouth
came
towards
him
with
the
velocity
of
an
arrow
be
quick
pinocchio
for
pity
sake
cried
the
beautiful
little
goat
bleating
and
pinocchio
swam
desperately
with
his
arms
his
chest
his
legs
and
his
feet
quick
pinocchio
the
monster
is
close
upon
you
and
pinocchio
swam
quicker
than
ever
and
flew
on
with
the
rapidity
of
a
ball
from
a
gun
he
had
nearly
reached
the
rock
and
the
little
goat
leaning
over
towards
the
sea
had
stretched
out
her
to
help
him
out
of
the
water
but
it
was
too
late
the
monster
had
overtaken
him
and
drawing
in
his
breath
he
sucked
in
the
poor
puppet
as
he
would
have
sucked
a
egg
and
he
swallowed
him
with
such
violence
and
avidity
that
pinocchio
in
falling
into
the
stomach
received
such
a
blow
that
he
remained
unconscious
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
when
he
came
to
himself
again
after
the
shock
he
could
not
in
the
least
imagine
in
what
world
he
was
all
around
him
it
was
quite
dark
and
the
darkness
was
so
black
and
so
profound
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
fallen
head
downwards
into
an
inkstand
full
of
ink
he
listened
but
he
could
hear
no
noise
only
from
time
to
time
great
gusts
of
wind
blew
in
his
face
at
first
he
could
not
understand
where
the
wind
came
from
but
at
last
he
discovered
that
it
came
out
of
the
monster
lungs
for
you
must
know
that
the
suffered
very
much
from
asthma
and
when
he
breathed
it
was
exactly
as
if
a
north
wind
was
blowing
pinocchio
at
first
tried
to
keep
up
his
courage
but
when
he
had
one
proof
after
another
that
he
was
really
shut
up
in
the
body
of
this
he
began
to
cry
and
scream
and
to
sob
out
help
help
oh
how
unfortunate
i
am
will
nobody
come
to
save
me
who
do
you
think
could
save
you
unhappy
wretch
said
a
voice
in
the
dark
that
sounded
like
a
guitar
out
of
tune
who
is
speaking
asked
pinocchio
frozen
with
terror
it
is
i
i
am
a
poor
tunny
who
was
swallowed
by
the
at
the
same
time
that
you
were
and
what
fish
are
you
i
have
nothing
in
common
with
fish
i
am
a
puppet
then
if
you
are
not
a
fish
why
did
you
let
yourself
be
swallowed
by
the
monster
i
did
let
myself
be
swallowed
it
was
the
monster
swallowed
me
and
now
what
are
we
to
do
here
in
the
dark
resign
ourselves
and
wait
until
the
has
digested
us
both
but
i
do
not
want
to
be
digested
howled
pinocchio
beginning
to
cry
again
neither
do
i
want
to
be
digested
added
the
tunny
but
i
am
enough
of
a
philosopher
to
console
myself
by
thinking
that
when
one
is
born
a
tunny
it
is
more
dignified
to
die
in
the
water
than
in
oil
that
is
all
nonsense
cried
pinocchio
it
is
my
opinion
replied
the
tunny
and
opinions
so
say
the
political
tunnies
ought
to
be
respected
to
sum
it
all
up
i
want
to
get
away
from
here
i
want
to
escape
escape
if
you
are
able
is
this
who
has
swallowed
us
very
big
asked
the
puppet
big
why
only
imagine
his
body
is
two
miles
long
without
counting
his
tail
whilst
they
were
holding
this
conversation
in
the
dark
pinocchio
thought
that
he
saw
a
light
a
long
way
off
what
is
that
little
light
i
see
in
the
distance
he
asked
it
is
most
likely
some
companion
in
misfortune
who
is
waiting
like
us
to
be
digested
i
will
go
and
find
him
do
you
not
think
that
it
may
by
chance
be
some
old
fish
who
perhaps
could
show
us
how
to
escape
i
hope
it
may
be
so
with
all
my
heart
dear
puppet
tunny
puppet
and
good
fortune
attend
you
where
shall
we
meet
again
who
can
say
it
is
better
not
even
to
think
of
it

a
happy
surprise
for
pinocchio
pinocchio
having
taken
leave
of
his
friend
the
tunny
began
to
grope
his
way
in
the
dark
through
the
body
of
the
taking
a
step
at
a
time
in
the
direction
of
the
light
that
he
saw
shining
dimly
at
a
great
distance
the
farther
he
advanced
the
brighter
became
the
light
and
he
walked
and
walked
until
at
last
he
reached
it
and
when
he
reached
it
what
did
he
find
i
will
give
you
a
thousand
guesses
he
found
a
little
table
spread
out
and
on
it
a
lighted
candle
stuck
into
a
green
glass
bottle
and
seated
at
the
table
was
a
little
old
man
he
was
eating
some
live
fish
and
they
were
so
very
much
alive
that
whilst
he
was
eating
them
they
sometimes
even
jumped
out
of
his
mouth
at
this
sight
pinocchio
was
filled
with
such
great
and
unexpected
joy
that
he
became
almost
delirious
he
wanted
to
laugh
he
wanted
to
cry
he
wanted
to
say
a
thousand
things
and
instead
he
could
only
stammer
out
a
few
confused
and
broken
words
at
last
he
succeeded
in
uttering
a
cry
of
joy
and
opening
his
arms
he
threw
them
around
the
little
old
man
neck
and
began
to
shout
oh
my
dear
papa
i
have
found
you
at
last
i
will
never
leave
you
more
never
more
never
more
then
my
eyes
tell
me
true
said
the
little
old
man
rubbing
his
eyes
then
you
are
really
my
dear
pinocchio
yes
yes
i
am
pinocchio
really
pinocchio
and
you
have
quite
forgiven
me
have
you
not
oh
my
dear
papa
how
good
you
are
and
to
think
that
i
on
the
contrary
oh
but
if
you
only
knew
what
misfortunes
have
been
poured
on
my
head
and
all
that
has
befallen
me
only
imagine
the
day
that
you
poor
dear
papa
sold
your
coat
to
buy
me
a
that
i
might
go
to
school
i
escaped
to
see
the
puppet
show
and
the
showman
wanted
to
put
me
on
the
fire
that
i
might
roast
his
mutton
and
he
was
the
same
that
afterwards
gave
me
five
gold
pieces
to
take
them
to
you
but
i
met
the
fox
and
the
cat
who
took
me
to
the
inn
of
the
red
where
they
ate
like
wolves
and
i
left
by
myself
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
i
encountered
assassins
who
ran
after
me
and
i
ran
away
and
they
followed
and
i
ran
and
they
always
followed
me
and
i
ran
until
they
hung
me
to
a
branch
of
a
big
oak
and
the
beautiful
child
with
blue
hair
sent
a
little
carriage
to
fetch
me
and
the
doctors
when
they
saw
me
said
immediately
he
is
not
dead
it
is
a
proof
that
he
is
still
alive
and
then
by
chance
i
told
a
lie
and
my
nose
began
to
grow
until
i
could
no
longer
get
through
the
door
of
the
room
for
which
reason
i
went
with
the
fox
and
the
cat
to
bury
the
four
gold
pieces
for
one
i
had
spent
at
the
inn
and
the
parrot
began
to
laugh
and
instead
of
two
thousand
gold
pieces
i
found
none
left
for
which
reason
the
judge
when
he
heard
that
i
had
been
robbed
had
me
immediately
put
in
prison
to
content
the
robbers
and
then
when
i
was
coming
away
i
saw
a
beautiful
bunch
of
grapes
in
a
field
and
i
was
caught
in
a
trap
and
the
peasant
who
was
quite
right
put
a
round
my
neck
that
i
might
guard
the
and
acknowledging
my
innocence
let
me
go
and
the
serpent
with
the
smoking
tail
began
to
laugh
and
broke
a
in
his
chest
and
so
i
returned
to
the
house
of
the
beautiful
child
who
was
dead
and
the
pigeon
seeing
that
i
was
crying
said
to
me
have
seen
your
father
who
was
building
a
little
boat
to
go
in
search
of
you
and
i
said
to
him
if
i
also
had
wings
and
he
said
to
me
you
want
to
go
to
your
father
and
i
said
doubt
but
who
will
take
me
to
him
and
he
said
to
me
will
take
you
and
i
said
to
him
and
he
said
to
me
on
my
back
and
so
we
flew
all
night
and
then
in
the
morning
all
the
fishermen
who
were
looking
out
to
sea
said
to
me
is
a
poor
man
in
a
boat
who
is
on
the
point
of
being
drowned
and
i
recognized
you
at
once
even
at
that
distance
for
my
heart
told
me
and
i
made
signs
to
you
to
return
to
land
i
also
recognized
you
said
geppetto
and
i
would
willingly
have
returned
to
the
shore
but
what
was
i
to
do
the
sea
was
tremendous
and
a
great
wave
upset
my
boat
then
a
horrible
who
was
near
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
in
the
water
came
towards
me
and
putting
out
his
tongue
took
hold
of
me
and
swallowed
me
as
if
i
had
been
a
little
apple
tart
and
how
long
have
you
been
shut
up
here
asked
pinocchio
illustration
they
thought
it
would
be
more
comfortable
to
get
on
the
tunny
back
since
that
day
it
must
be
nearly
two
years
ago
two
years
my
dear
pinocchio
that
have
seemed
like
two
centuries
and
how
have
you
managed
to
live
and
where
did
you
get
the
candle
and
the
matches
to
light
it
who
gave
them
to
you
stop
and
i
will
tell
you
everything
you
must
know
then
that
in
the
same
storm
in
which
my
boat
was
upset
a
merchant
vessel
foundered
the
sailors
were
all
saved
but
the
vessel
went
to
the
bottom
and
the
who
had
that
day
an
excellent
appetite
after
he
had
swallowed
me
swallowed
also
the
vessel
how
he
swallowed
it
in
one
mouthful
and
the
only
thing
that
he
spat
out
was
the
mainmast
that
had
stuck
between
his
teeth
like
a
fortunately
for
me
the
vessel
was
laden
with
preserved
meat
in
tins
biscuit
bottles
of
wine
dried
raisins
cheese
coffee
sugar
candles
and
boxes
of
wax
matches
with
this
providential
supply
i
have
been
able
to
live
for
two
years
but
i
have
arrived
at
the
end
of
my
resources
there
is
nothing
left
in
the
larder
and
this
candle
that
you
see
burning
is
the
last
that
remains
and
after
that
after
that
dear
boy
we
shall
both
remain
in
the
dark
then
dear
little
papa
said
pinocchio
there
is
no
time
to
lose
we
must
think
of
escaping
of
escaping
how
we
must
escape
through
the
mouth
of
the
throw
ourselves
into
the
sea
and
swim
away
you
talk
well
but
dear
pinocchio
i
do
know
how
to
swim
what
does
that
matter
i
am
a
good
swimmer
and
you
can
get
on
my
shoulders
and
i
will
carry
you
safely
to
shore
all
illusions
my
boy
replied
geppetto
shaking
his
head
with
a
melancholy
smile
do
you
suppose
it
possible
that
a
puppet
like
you
scarcely
a
yard
high
could
have
the
strength
to
swim
with
me
on
his
shoulders
try
it
and
you
will
see
without
another
word
pinocchio
took
the
candle
in
his
hand
and
going
in
front
to
light
the
way
he
said
to
his
father
follow
me
and
do
be
afraid
and
they
walked
for
some
time
and
traversed
the
body
and
the
stomach
of
the
but
when
they
had
arrived
at
the
point
where
the
big
throat
began
they
thought
it
better
to
stop
to
give
a
good
look
around
and
to
choose
the
best
moment
for
escaping
now
i
must
tell
you
that
the
being
very
old
and
suffering
from
asthma
and
palpitation
of
the
heart
was
obliged
to
sleep
with
his
mouth
open
pinocchio
therefore
having
approached
the
entrance
to
his
throat
and
looking
up
could
see
beyond
the
enormous
gaping
mouth
a
large
piece
of
starry
sky
and
beautiful
moonlight
this
is
the
moment
to
escape
he
whispered
turning
to
his
father
the
is
sleeping
like
a
dormouse
the
sea
is
calm
and
it
is
as
light
as
day
follow
me
dear
papa
and
in
a
short
time
we
shall
be
in
safety
they
immediately
climbed
up
the
throat
of
the
and
having
reached
his
immense
mouth
they
began
to
walk
on
tiptoe
down
his
tongue
before
taking
the
final
leap
the
puppet
said
to
his
father
get
on
my
shoulders
and
put
your
arms
tightly
around
my
neck
i
will
take
care
of
the
rest
as
soon
as
geppetto
was
firmly
settled
on
his
son
shoulders
pinocchio
feeling
sure
of
himself
threw
himself
into
the
water
and
began
to
swim
the
sea
was
as
smooth
as
oil
the
moon
shone
brilliantly
and
the
was
sleeping
so
profoundly
that
even
a
cannonade
would
have
failed
to
wake
him
illustration
chapter
xxxvi
pinocchio
at
last
ceases
to
be
a
puppet
and
becomes
a
boy
whilst
pinocchio
was
swimming
quickly
towards
the
shore
he
discovered
that
his
father
who
was
on
his
shoulders
with
his
legs
in
the
water
was
trembling
as
violently
as
if
the
poor
man
had
an
attack
of
ague
fever
was
he
trembling
from
cold
or
from
fear
perhaps
a
little
from
both
the
one
and
the
other
but
pinocchio
thinking
it
was
from
fear
said
to
comfort
him
courage
papa
in
a
few
minutes
we
shall
be
safely
on
shore
but
where
is
this
blessed
shore
asked
the
little
old
man
becoming
still
more
frightened
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
as
tailors
do
when
they
wish
to
thread
a
needle
i
have
been
looking
in
every
direction
and
i
see
nothing
but
the
sky
and
the
sea
but
i
see
the
shore
as
well
said
the
puppet
you
must
know
that
i
am
like
a
cat
i
see
better
by
night
than
by
day
poor
pinocchio
was
making
a
pretense
of
being
in
good
spirits
but
in
reality
he
was
beginning
to
feel
discouraged
his
strength
was
failing
he
was
gasping
and
panting
for
breath
he
could
do
no
more
and
the
shore
was
still
far
off
he
swam
until
he
had
no
breath
left
then
he
turned
his
head
to
geppetto
and
said
in
broken
words
papa
help
me
i
am
dying
the
father
and
son
were
on
the
point
of
drowning
when
they
heard
a
voice
like
a
guitar
out
of
tune
saying
who
is
it
that
is
dying
it
is
i
and
my
poor
father
i
know
that
voice
you
are
pinocchio
precisely
and
you
i
am
the
tunny
your
prison
companion
in
the
body
of
the
and
how
did
you
manage
to
escape
i
followed
your
example
you
showed
me
the
road
and
i
escaped
after
you
tunny
you
have
arrived
at
the
right
moment
i
implore
you
to
help
us
or
we
are
lost
willingly
and
with
all
my
heart
you
must
both
of
you
take
hold
of
my
tail
and
leave
it
to
me
to
guide
you
i
will
take
you
on
shore
in
four
minutes
geppetto
and
pinocchio
as
i
need
not
tell
you
accepted
the
offer
at
once
but
instead
of
holding
on
by
his
tail
they
thought
it
would
be
more
comfortable
to
get
on
the
tunny
back
having
reached
the
shore
pinocchio
sprang
first
on
land
that
he
might
help
his
father
to
do
the
same
he
then
turned
to
the
tunny
and
said
to
him
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
my
friend
you
have
saved
my
papa
life
i
can
find
no
words
with
which
to
thank
you
properly
permit
me
at
least
to
give
you
a
kiss
as
a
sign
of
my
eternal
gratitude
the
tunny
put
his
head
out
of
the
water
and
pinocchio
kneeling
on
the
ground
kissed
him
tenderly
on
the
mouth
at
this
spontaneous
proof
of
warm
affection
the
poor
tunny
who
was
not
accustomed
to
it
felt
extremely
touched
and
ashamed
to
let
himself
be
seen
crying
like
a
child
he
plunged
under
the
water
and
disappeared
by
this
time
the
day
had
dawned
pinocchio
then
offering
his
arm
to
geppetto
who
had
scarcely
breath
to
stand
said
to
him
lean
on
my
arm
dear
papa
and
let
us
go
we
will
walk
very
slowly
like
the
ants
and
when
we
are
tired
we
can
rest
by
the
wayside
and
where
shall
we
go
asked
geppetto
in
search
of
some
house
or
cottage
where
they
will
give
us
for
charity
a
mouthful
of
bread
and
a
little
straw
to
serve
as
a
bed
they
had
not
gone
a
hundred
yards
when
they
saw
by
the
roadside
two
individuals
begging
they
were
the
cat
and
the
fox
but
they
were
scarcely
recognizable
fancy
the
cat
had
so
long
feigned
blindness
that
she
had
become
blind
in
reality
and
the
fox
old
mangy
and
with
one
side
paralyzed
had
not
even
his
tail
left
that
sneaking
thief
having
fallen
into
the
most
squalid
misery
one
fine
day
had
found
himself
obliged
to
sell
his
beautiful
tail
to
a
traveling
peddler
who
bought
it
to
drive
away
flies
oh
pinocchio
cried
the
fox
give
a
little
in
charity
to
two
poor
infirm
people
infirm
people
repeated
the
cat
begone
impostors
answered
the
puppet
you
took
me
in
once
but
you
will
never
catch
me
again
believe
me
pinocchio
we
are
now
poor
and
unfortunate
indeed
if
you
are
poor
you
deserve
it
recollect
the
proverb
money
never
fructifies
begone
impostors
and
thus
saying
pinocchio
and
geppetto
went
their
way
in
peace
when
they
had
gone
another
hundred
yards
they
saw
at
the
end
of
a
path
in
the
middle
of
the
fields
a
nice
little
straw
hut
with
a
roof
of
tiles
and
bricks
that
hut
must
be
inhabited
by
some
one
said
pinocchio
let
us
go
and
knock
at
the
door
they
went
and
knocked
we
are
a
poor
father
and
son
without
bread
and
without
a
roof
answered
the
puppet
turn
the
key
and
the
door
will
open
said
the
same
little
voice
pinocchio
turned
the
key
and
the
door
opened
they
went
in
and
looked
here
there
and
everywhere
but
could
see
no
one
oh
where
is
the
master
of
the
house
said
pinocchio
much
surprised
here
i
am
up
here
the
father
and
son
looked
immediately
up
to
the
ceiling
and
there
on
a
beam
they
saw
the
oh
my
dear
little
cricket
said
pinocchio
bowing
politely
to
him
ah
now
you
call
me
dear
little
cricket
but
do
you
remember
the
time
when
you
threw
the
handle
of
a
hammer
at
me
to
drive
me
from
your
house
you
are
right
cricket
drive
me
away
also
throw
the
handle
of
a
hammer
at
me
but
have
pity
on
my
poor
papa
i
will
have
pity
on
both
father
and
son
but
i
wished
to
remind
you
of
the
ill
treatment
i
received
from
you
to
teach
you
that
in
this
world
when
it
is
possible
we
should
show
courtesy
to
everybody
if
we
wish
it
to
be
extended
to
us
in
our
hour
of
need
you
are
right
cricket
you
are
right
and
i
will
bear
in
mind
the
lesson
you
have
given
me
but
tell
me
how
you
managed
to
buy
this
beautiful
hut
this
hut
was
given
to
me
yesterday
by
a
goat
whose
wool
was
of
a
beautiful
blue
color
and
where
has
the
goat
gone
asked
pinocchio
with
lively
curiosity
i
do
not
know
and
when
will
it
come
back
it
will
never
come
back
it
went
away
yesterday
in
great
grief
and
bleating
it
seemed
to
say
pinocchio
i
shall
never
see
him
more
for
by
this
time
the
must
have
devoured
him
did
it
really
say
that
then
it
was
she
it
was
my
dear
little
fairy
exclaimed
pinocchio
crying
and
sobbing
when
he
had
cried
for
some
time
he
dried
his
eyes
and
prepared
a
comfortable
bed
of
straw
for
geppetto
to
lie
down
upon
then
he
asked
the
cricket
tell
me
little
cricket
where
can
i
find
a
tumbler
of
milk
for
my
poor
papa
three
fields
off
from
here
there
lives
a
gardener
called
giangio
who
keeps
cows
go
to
him
and
you
will
get
the
milk
you
are
in
want
of
pinocchio
ran
all
the
way
to
giangio
house
and
the
gardener
asked
him
how
much
milk
do
you
want
i
want
a
tumblerful
a
tumbler
of
milk
costs
five
cents
begin
by
giving
me
the
five
cents
i
have
not
even
one
cent
replied
pinocchio
grieved
and
mortified
that
is
bad
puppet
answered
the
gardener
if
you
have
not
even
one
cent
i
have
not
even
a
drop
of
milk
i
must
have
patience
said
pinocchio
and
he
turned
to
go
wait
a
little
said
giangio
we
can
come
to
an
arrangement
together
will
you
undertake
to
turn
the
pumping
machine
what
is
the
pumping
machine
it
is
a
wooden
pole
which
serves
to
draw
up
the
water
from
the
cistern
to
water
the
vegetables
you
can
try
me
well
then
if
you
will
draw
a
hundred
buckets
of
water
i
will
give
you
in
compensation
a
tumbler
of
milk
it
is
a
bargain
giangio
then
led
pinocchio
to
the
kitchen
garden
and
taught
him
how
to
turn
the
pumping
machine
pinocchio
immediately
began
to
work
but
before
he
had
drawn
up
the
hundred
buckets
of
water
the
perspiration
was
pouring
from
his
head
to
his
feet
never
before
had
he
undergone
such
fatigue
up
till
now
said
the
gardener
the
labor
of
turning
the
pumping
machine
was
performed
by
my
little
donkey
but
the
poor
animal
is
dying
will
you
take
me
to
see
him
said
pinocchio
willingly
when
pinocchio
went
into
the
stable
he
saw
a
beautiful
little
donkey
stretched
on
the
straw
worn
out
from
hunger
and
overwork
after
looking
at
him
earnestly
he
said
to
himself
much
troubled
i
am
sure
i
know
this
little
donkey
his
face
is
not
new
to
me
and
bending
over
him
he
asked
him
in
asinine
language
who
are
you
at
this
question
the
little
donkey
opened
his
dying
eyes
and
answered
in
broken
words
in
the
same
language
i
am
can
dle
wick
and
having
again
closed
his
eyes
he
expired
oh
poor
candlewick
said
pinocchio
in
a
low
voice
and
taking
a
handful
of
straw
he
dried
a
tear
that
was
rolling
down
his
face
do
you
grieve
for
a
donkey
that
cost
you
nothing
said
the
gardener
what
must
it
be
to
me
who
bought
him
for
ready
money
i
must
tell
you
he
was
my
friend
your
friend
one
of
my
how
shouted
giangio
laughing
loudly
how
had
you
donkeys
for
i
can
imagine
what
wonderful
studies
you
must
have
made
the
puppet
who
felt
much
mortified
at
these
words
did
not
answer
but
taking
his
tumbler
of
milk
still
quite
warm
he
returned
to
the
hut
and
from
that
day
for
more
than
five
months
he
continued
to
get
up
at
daybreak
every
morning
to
go
and
turn
the
pumping
machine
to
earn
the
tumbler
of
milk
that
was
of
such
benefit
to
his
father
in
his
bad
state
of
health
nor
was
he
satisfied
with
this
for
during
the
time
that
he
had
over
he
learned
to
make
hampers
and
baskets
of
rushes
and
with
the
money
he
obtained
by
selling
them
he
was
able
with
great
economy
to
provide
for
all
the
daily
expenses
amongst
other
things
he
constructed
an
elegant
little
in
which
he
could
take
his
father
out
on
fine
days
to
breathe
a
mouthful
of
fresh
air
by
his
industry
ingenuity
and
his
anxiety
to
work
and
to
overcome
difficulties
he
not
only
succeeded
in
maintaining
his
father
who
continued
infirm
in
comfort
but
he
also
contrived
to
put
aside
five
dollars
to
buy
himself
a
new
coat
one
morning
he
said
to
his
father
i
am
going
to
the
neighboring
market
to
buy
myself
a
jacket
a
cap
and
a
pair
of
shoes
when
i
return
he
added
laughing
i
shall
be
so
well
dressed
that
you
will
take
me
for
a
fine
gentleman
and
leaving
the
house
he
began
to
run
merrily
and
happily
along
all
at
once
he
heard
himself
called
by
name
and
turning
around
he
saw
a
big
snail
crawling
out
from
the
hedge
do
you
not
know
me
asked
the
snail
it
seems
to
me
and
yet
i
am
not
sure
do
you
not
remember
the
snail
who
was
to
the
fairy
with
blue
hair
do
you
not
remember
the
time
when
i
came
downstairs
to
let
you
in
and
you
were
caught
by
your
foot
which
you
had
stuck
through
the
i
remember
it
all
shouted
pinocchio
tell
me
quickly
my
beautiful
little
snail
where
have
you
left
my
good
fairy
what
is
she
doing
has
she
forgiven
me
does
she
still
remember
me
does
she
still
wish
me
well
is
she
far
from
here
can
i
go
and
see
her
to
all
these
rapid
breathless
questions
the
snail
replied
in
her
usual
phlegmatic
manner
my
dear
pinocchio
the
poor
fairy
is
lying
in
bed
at
the
hospital
at
the
hospital
it
is
only
too
true
overtaken
by
a
thousand
misfortunes
she
has
fallen
seriously
ill
and
she
has
not
even
enough
to
buy
herself
a
mouthful
of
bread
is
it
really
so
oh
what
sorrow
you
have
given
me
oh
poor
fairy
poor
fairy
poor
fairy

i
had
a
million
i
would
run
and
carry
it
to
her
but

five
dollars
here
they
are
i
was
going
to
buy
a
new
coat

and
carry
them
at
once
to

good
fairy
and

new
coat

rags
that

to
help

and

quick
and

two
days

place

time

will
work
five
hours
more
that
i
may
also
maintain
my
good
mamma
snail
i
shall
expect
you
in
two
days
the
snail
contrary
to
her
usual
habits
began
to
run
like
a
lizard
in
a
hot
august
sun
that
evening
pinocchio
instead
of
going
to
bed
at
ten
sat
up
till
midnight
had
struck
and
instead
of
making
eight
baskets
of
rushes
he
made
sixteen
then
he
went
to
bed
and
fell
asleep
and
whilst
he
slept
he
thought
that
he
saw
the
fairy
smiling
and
beautiful
who
after
having
kissed
him
said
to
him
well
done
pinocchio
to
reward
you
for
your
good
heart
i
will
forgive
you
for
all
that
is
past
boys
who
minister
tenderly
to
their
parents
and
assist
them
in
their
misery
and
infirmities
are
deserving
of
great
praise
and
affection
even
if
they
can
not
be
cited
as
examples
of
obedience
and
good
behavior
try
and
do
better
in
the
future
and
you
will
be
happy
at
this
moment
his
dream
ended
and
pinocchio
opened
his
eyes
and
awoke
but
imagine
his
astonishment
when
upon
awakening
he
discovered
that
he
was
no
longer
a
wooden
puppet
but
that
he
had
become
instead
a
boy
like
all
other
boys
he
gave
a
glance
round
and
saw
that
the
straw
walls
of
the
hut
had
disappeared
and
that
he
was
in
a
pretty
little
room
furnished
and
arranged
with
a
simplicity
that
was
almost
elegance
jumping
out
of
bed
he
found
a
new
suit
of
clothes
ready
for
him
a
new
cap
and
a
pair
of
new
boots
that
fitted
him
beautifully
he
was
hardly
dressed
when
he
naturally
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
pulled
out
a
little
ivory
purse
on
which
these
words
were
written
the
fairy
with
blue
hair
returns
the
five
dollars
to
her
dear
pinocchio
and
thanks
him
for
his
good
heart
he
opened
the
purse
and
instead
of
five
dollars
he
saw
fifty
shining
gold
pieces
fresh
from
the
mint
he
then
went
and
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
and
he
thought
he
was
some
one
else
for
he
no
longer
saw
the
usual
reflection
of
a
wooden
puppet
he
was
greeted
instead
by
the
image
of
a
bright
intelligent
boy
with
chestnut
hair
blue
eyes
and
looking
as
happy
and
joyful
as
if
it
were
the
easter
holidays
in
the
midst
of
all
these
wonders
succeeding
each
other
pinocchio
felt
quite
bewildered
and
he
could
not
tell
if
he
was
really
awake
or
if
he
was
dreaming
with
his
eyes
open
where
can
my
papa
be
he
exclaimed
suddenly
and
going
into
the
next
room
he
found
old
geppetto
quite
well
lively
and
in
good
humor
just
as
he
had
been
formerly
he
had
already
resumed
his
trade
of
and
he
was
designing
a
rich
and
beautiful
frame
of
leaves
flowers
and
the
heads
of
animals
satisfy
my
curiosity
dear
papa
said
pinocchio
throwing
his
arms
around
his
neck
and
covering
him
with
kisses
how
can
this
sudden
change
be
accounted
for
this
sudden
change
in
our
home
is
all
your
doing
answered
geppetto
how
my
doing
because
when
boys
who
have
behaved
badly
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
become
good
they
have
the
power
of
bringing
contentment
and
happiness
to
their
families
and
where
has
the
old
wooden
pinocchio
hidden
himself
there
he
is
answered
geppetto
and
he
pointed
to
a
big
puppet
leaning
against
a
chair
with
its
head
on
one
side
its
arms
dangling
and
its
legs
so
crossed
and
bent
that
it
was
really
a
miracle
that
it
remained
standing
pinocchio
turned
and
looked
at
it
and
after
he
had
looked
at
it
for
a
short
time
he
said
to
himself
with
great
complacency
how
ridiculous
i
was
when
i
was
a
puppet
and
how
glad
i
am
that
i
have
become
a
little
boy
