to

the
army
the
bulk
of
which
was
in
saxony
partial
insurrections
occurred
in
many
places
the
interior
of
france
proper
was
indeed
still
in
a
state
of
tranquillity
but
it
was
not
so
in
the
provinces
annexed
by
force
to
the
extremities
of
the
empire
especially
in
the
north
and
in
the
unfortunate
hanse
towns
for
which
since
my
residence
at
hamburg
i
have
always
felt
the
greatest
interest
the
intelligence
i
received
was
derived
from
such
unquestionable
sources
that
i
can
pledge
myself
for
the
truth
of
what
i
have
to
state
respecting
the
events
which
occurred
in
those
provinces
at
the
commencement
of
and
subsequently
i
obtained
a
confirmation
of
all
the
facts
communicated
by
my
correspondence
when
i
was
sent
to
hamburg
by
louis
xviii
in
steuve
agent
from
the
court
of
russia
who
lived
at
altona
apparently
as
a
private
individual
profited
by
the
irritation
produced
by
the
measures
adopted
at
hamburg
his
plans
were
so
well
arranged
that
he
was
promptly
informed
of
the
route
of
the
grand
army
from
moscow
and
the
approach
of
the
allied
troops
aided
by
the
knowledge
and
activity
of
sieur
hanft
of
hamburg
steuve
profited
by
the
discontent
of
a
people
so
tyrannically
governed
and
seized
the
opportunity
for
producing
an
explosion
between
eight
and
nine
on
the
morning
of
the
of
february
an
occurrence
in
which
the
people
were
concerned
was
the
signal
for
a
revolt
an
individual
returning
to
hamburg
by
the
altona
gate
would
not
submit
to
be
searched
by
a
fiscal
agent
who
in
consequence
maltreated
him
and
wounded
him
severely
the
populace
instantly
rose
drove
away
the
revenue
guard
and
set
fire
to
the
house
the
people
also
excited
by
secret
agents
attacked
other
french
posts
where
they
committed
the
same
excesses
surprised
at
this
unexpected
movement
the
french
authorities
retired
to
the
houses
in
which
they
resided
all
the
respectable
inhabitants
who
were
unconnected
with
the
tumult
likewise
returned
to
their
homes
and
no
person
appeared
out
of
doors
general
carry
cyr
had
the
command
of
hamburg
after
the
prince
of
eckmuhl
departure
for
the
russian
campaign
general
carry
cyr
is
not
to
be
contused
with
the
marshal
gonvion
de
cyr
he
fell
into
disgrace
for
his
conduct
at
hamburg
at
this
time
and
was
not
again
employed
by
napoleon
under
the
restoration
he
became
governor
of
french
guiana
at
the
first
news
of
the
revolt
he
set
about
packing
up
his
papers
and
comte
de
chaban
konning
the
prefect
of
hamburg
and
daubignosc
the
director
of
police
followed
his
example
it
was
not
till
about
four
in
the
afternoon
that
a
detachment
of
danish
hussars
arrived
at
hamburg
and
the
populace
was
then
speedily
dispersed
all
the
respectable
citizens
and
men
of
property
assembled
the
next
morning
and
adopted
means
for
securing
internal
tranquillity
so
that
the
danish
troops
were
enabled
to
return
to
altona
search
was
then
made
for
the
ringleaders
of
the
disturbance
many
persons
were
arrested
and
a
military
commission
ad
hoc
was
appointed
to
try
them
the
commission
however
condemned
only
one
individual
who
being
convicted
of
being
one
of
the
most
active
voters
was
sentenced
to
be
shot
and
the
sentence
was
carried
into
execution
on
the
february
a
similar
commotion
took
place
at
lubeck
attempts
were
made
to
attack
the
french
authorities
the
respectable
citizens
instantly
assembled
protected
them
against
outrage
and
escorted
them
in
safety
to
hamburg
where
they
arrived
on
the
the
precipitate
flight
of
these
persons
from
lubeck
spread
some
alarm
in
hamburg
the
danger
was
supposed
to
be
greater
than
it
was
because
the
fugitives
were
accompanied
by
a
formidable
body
of
troops
but
these
were
not
the
only
attempts
to
throw
off
the
yoke
of
french
domination
which
had
become
insupportable
all
the
left
bank
of
the
elbe
was
immediately
in
a
state
of
insurrection
and
all
the
official
persons
took
refuge
in
hamburg
during
these
partial
insurrections
everything
was
neglected
indecision
weakness
and
cupidity
were
manifested
everywhere
instead
of
endeavours
to
soothe
the
minds
of
the
people
which
had
been
long
exasperated
by
intolerable
tyranny
recourse
was
had
to
rigorous
measures
the
prisons
were
crowded
with
a
host
of
persons
declared
to
be
suspected
upon
the
mere
representations
of
the
agents
of
the
police
on
the
of
march
a
special
military
commission
condemned
six
householders
of
hamburg
and
its
neighbourhood
to
be
shot
on
the
glacis
for
no
other
offence
than
having
been
led
either
by
chance
or
curiosity
to
a
part
of
the
town
which
was
the
scene
of
one
of
the
riots
these
executions
excited
equal
horror
and
indignation
and
general
carra
cyr
was
obliged
to
issue
a
proclamation
for
the
dissolution
of
the
military
commission
by
whom
the
men
had
been
sentenced
the
intelligence
of
the
march
of
the
russian
and
prussian
troops
who
were
descending
the
elbe
increased
the
prevailing
agitation
in
westphalia
hanover
mecklenburg
and
pomerania
and
all
the
french
troops
cantoned
between
berlin
and
hamburg
including
those
who
occupied
the
coast
of
the
baltic
fell
back
upon
hamburg
general
carra
cyr
and
baron
konning
the
prefect
of
hamburg
used
to
go
every
evening
to
altona
the
latter
worn
out
by
anxiety
and
his
unsettled
state
of
life
lost
his
reason
and
on
his
way
to
hamburg
on
the
of
may
he
attempted
to
cut
his
throat
with
a
razor
his
de
chambre
saved
his
life
by
rushing
upon
him
before
he
had
time
to
execute
his
design
it
was
given
out
that
he
had
broken
a
and
he
was
conveyed
to
altona
where
his
wound
was
cured
and
he
subsequently
recovered
from
his
derangement
konning
who
was
a
native
of
holland
was
a
worthy
man
but
possessed
no
decision
of
character
and
but
little
ability
at
this
juncture
exaggerated
reports
were
circulated
respecting
the
approach
of
a
russian
corps
a
retreat
was
immediately
ordered
and
it
was
executed
on
the
of
march
general
carra
cyr
having
no
money
for
the
troops
helped
himself
to
francs
out
of
the
municipal
treasury
he
left
hamburg
at
the
head
of
the
troops
and
the
enrolled
men
of
the
service
he
was
escorted
by
the
burgher
guard
which
protected
him
from
the
insults
of
the
populace
and
the
good
people
of
hamburg
never
had
any
visitors
of
whom
they
were
more
happy
to
be
rid
this
sudden
retreat
excited
napoleon
indignation
he
accused
general
cyr
of
pusillanimity
in
an
article
inserted
in
the
and
afterwards
copied
by
his
order
into
all
the
journals
in
fact
had
general
cyr
been
better
informed
or
less
easily
alarmed
he
might
have
kept
hamburg
and
prevented
its
temporary
occupation
by
the
enemy
to
dislodge
whom
it
was
necessary
to
besiege
the
city
two
months
afterwards
cyr
had
regular
troops
and
a
considerable
body
of
men
in
the
service
general
morand
could
have
furnished
him
with
men
from
mecklenburg
he
might
therefore
not
only
have
kept
possession
of
hamburg
two
months
longer
but
even
to
the
end
of
the
war
as
general
lexnarrois
retained
possession
of
magdeburg
had
not
general
cyr
so
hastily
evacuated
the
elbe
he
would
have
been
promptly
aided
by
the
corps
which
general
vandamme
soon
brought
from
the
wesel
and
afterwards
by
the
very
corps
with
which
marshal
davoust
recaptured
hamburg
the
events
just
described
occurred
before
napoleon
quitted
paris
in
the
month
of
august
all
negotiation
was
broken
off
with
austria
though
that
power
still
adhering
to
her
policy
continued
to
protest
fidelity
to
the
cause
of
the
emperor
napoleon
until
the
moment
when
her
preparations
were
completed
and
her
resolution
formed
but
if
there
was
duplicity
at
vienna
was
there
not
folly
nay
blindness
in
the
cabinet
of
the
tuileries
could
we
reasonably
rely
upon
austria
she
had
seen
the
russian
army
pass
the
vistula
and
advance
as
far
as
the
saale
without
offering
any
remonstrance
at
that
moment
a
single
movement
of
her
troops
a
word
of
declaration
would
have
prevented
everything
as
therefore
she
would
not
avert
the
evil
when
she
might
have
done
so
with
certainty
and
safety
there
must
have
been
singular
folly
and
blindness
in
the
cabinet
who
saw
this
conduct
and
did
not
understand
it
i
now
proceed
to
mention
the
further
misfortunes
which
occurred
in
the
north
of
germany
and
particularly
at
hamburg
at
fifteen
leagues
east
of
hamburg
but
within
its
territory
is
a
village
named
bergdorf
it
was
in
that
village
that
the
cossacks
were
first
seen
twelve
or
fifteen
hundred
of
them
arrived
there
under
the
command
of
colonel
tettenborn
but
for
the
retreat
of
the
french
troops
amounting
to
exclusive
of
men
in
the
customhouse
service
no
attempt
would
have
been
made
upon
hamburg
but
the
very
name
of
the
cossacks
inspired
a
degree
of
terror
which
must
be
fresh
in
the
recollection
of
every
one
alarm
spread
in
hamburg
which
being
destitute
of
troops
and
artillery
and
surrounded
with
dilapidated
fortifications
could
offer
no
defence
the
senator
bartch
and
doctor
know
took
upon
themselves
to
proceed
to
bergdorf
to
solicit
colonel
tettenborn
to
take
possession
of
hamburg
observing
that
they
felt
sure
of
his
sentiments
of
moderation
and
that
they
trusted
they
would
grant
protection
to
a
city
which
had
immense
commercial
relations
with
russia
tettenborn
did
not
place
reliance
on
these
propositions
because
he
could
not
suppose
that
there
had
been
such
a
precipitate
evacuation
he
thought
they
were
merely
a
snare
to
entrap
him
and
refused
to
accede
to
them
but
a
doctor
von
hess
a
swede
settled
in
hamburg
some
years
and
known
to
tettenborn
as
a
decided
partisan
of
england
and
russia
persuaded
the
russian
commander
to
comply
with
the
wishes
of
the
citizens
of
hamburg
however
tettenborn
consented
only
on
the
following
conditions
that
the
old
government
should
be
instantly
that
a
deputation
of
senators
in
their
old
costume
should
invite
him
to
take
possession
of
hamburg
which
he
would
enter
only
as
a
free
and
imperial
hanse
town
that
if
those
conditions
were
not
complied
with
he
would
regard
hamburg
as
a
french
town
and
consequently
hostile
notwithstanding
the
real
satisfaction
with
which
the
senators
of
hamburg
received
those
propositions
they
were
restrained
by
the
fear
of
a
reverse
of
fortune
they
however
determined
to
accept
them
thinking
that
whatever
might
happen
they
could
screen
themselves
by
alleging
that
necessity
had
driven
them
to
the
step
they
took
they
therefore
declared
their
compliance
with
the
conditions
and
that
night
and
the
following
day
were
occupied
in
assembling
the
senate
which
had
been
so
long
dissolved
and
in
making
the
preparations
which
tettenborn
required
at
four
in
the
afternoon
of
the
of
march
a
picket
of
cossacks
consisting
of
only
forty
men
took
possession
of
a
town
recently
flourishing
and
containing
a
population
of
but
ruined
and
reduced
to
inhabitants
by
the
blessing
of
being
united
to
the
french
empire
on
the
following
day
the
colonel
tettenborn
entered
hamburg
at
the
head
of
regular
and
irregular
cossacks
i
have
described
the
military
situation
of
hamburg
when
it
was
evacuated
on
the
of
march
and
napoleon
displeasure
may
be
easily
conceived
tettenborn
was
received
with
all
the
honours
usually
bestowed
upon
a
conqueror
enthusiasm
was
almost
universal
for
several
nights
the
people
devoted
themselves
to
rejoicing
the
cossacks
were
gorged
with
provisions
and
drink
and
were
not
a
little
astonished
at
the
handsome
reception
they
experienced
it
was
not
until
the
expiration
of
three
or
four
days
that
the
people
began
to
perceive
the
small
number
of
the
allied
troops
their
amount
gradually
diminished
on
the
day
after
the
arrival
of
the
cossacks
a
detachment
was
sent
to
lubeck
where
they
were
received
with
the
same
honours
as
at
hamburg
other
detachments
were
sent
upon
different
places
and
after
four
days
occupation
there
remained
in
hamburg
only
out
of
the
cossacks
who
had
entered
on
the
march
the
first
thing
their
commander
did
was
to
take
possession
of
the
office
and
the
treasuries
of
the
different
public
offices
all
the
movable
effects
of
the
french
government
and
its
agents
were
seized
and
sold
the
officers
evinced
a
true
cossack
disregard
of
the
rights
of
private
property
counts
huhn
buasenitz
and
venechtern
who
had
joined
tettenborn
staff
rendered
themselves
conspicuous
by
plundering
the
property
of
pyonnier
the
director
of
the
customs
and
gonae
the
postmaster
and
not
a
bottle
of
wine
was
left
in
their
cellars
tettenborn
laid
hands
upon
a
sum
of
money
consisting
of
upwards
of
louis
in
gold
belonging
to
gonse
which
had
been
lodged
with
schwartz
a
respectable
banker
in
hamburg
who
filled
the
office
of
prussian
consul
schwartz
with
whom
this
money
had
been
deposited
for
the
sake
of
security
had
also
the
care
of
some
valuable
jewels
belonging
to
mesdames
carry
cyr
and
daubignoac
tettenborn
carried
off
these
as
well
as
the
money
schwartz
remonstrated
in
his
character
of
prussian
consul
prussia
being
the
ally
of
russia
but
he
was
considered
merely
as
a
banker
and
could
obtain
no
redress
tettenborn
like
most
of
the
cossack
chiefs
was
nothing
but
a
man
for
blows
and
pillage
but
the
agent
of
russia
was
steuve
whose
name
i
have
already
mentioned
orders
were
speedily
given
for
a
levy
of
troops
both
in
infantry
and
cavalry
to
be
called
hanseatic
volunteers
a
man
named
hanft
who
had
formerly
been
a
butcher
raised
at
his
own
expense
a
company
of
foot
and
one
of
lancers
of
which
he
took
the
command
this
undertaking
which
cost
him
francs
may
afford
some
idea
of
the
attachment
of
the
people
of
hamburg
to
the
french
government
but
money
as
well
as
men
was
wanting
and
a
heavy
contribution
was
imposed
to
defray
the
expense
of
enrolling
a
number
of
workmen
out
of
employment
and
idlers
of
various
kinds
voluntary
donations
were
solicited
and
enthusiasm
was
so
general
that
even
gave
their
rings
the
sums
thus
collected
were
paid
into
the
chest
of
tettenborn
staff
and
became
a
prey
to
dishonest
appropriation
with
respect
to
this
money
a
sieur
oswald
was
accused
of
not
having
acted
with
the
scrupulous
delicacy
which
madame
de
stael
attributes
to
his
namesake
in
her
romance
of
corinne
between
and
men
were
levied
in
the
hanse
towns
and
their
environs
the
population
of
which
had
been
so
greatly
reduced
within
two
years
these
undisciplined
troops
who
had
been
for
the
most
part
levied
from
the
lowest
classes
of
society
committed
so
many
outrages
that
they
soon
obtained
the
surname
of
the
cossacks
of
the
elbe
and
certainly
they
well
deserved
it
such
was
the
hatred
which
the
french
government
had
inspired
in
hamburg
that
the
occupation
of
tettenborn
was
looked
upon
as
a
deliverance
on
the
colonel
departure
the
senate
anxious
to
give
high
a
testimonial
of
gratitude
presented
him
with
the
freedom
of
the
city
accompanied
by
gold
fredericks
francs
with
which
he
was
doubtless
much
more
gratified
than
with
the
honour
of
the
citizenship
the
restored
senate
of
hamburg
did
not
long
survive
the
people
of
the
hanse
towns
learned
with
no
small
alarm
that
the
emperor
was
making
immense
preparations
to
fall
upon
germany
where
his
lieutenants
could
not
fail
to
take
cruel
revenge
on
those
who
had
disavowed
his
authority
before
he
quitted
paris
on
the
of
april
napoleon
had
recalled
under
the
banners
of
the
army
men
exclusive
of
the
guards
of
honour
and
it
was
evident
that
with
such
a
force
he
might
venture
on
a
great
game
and
probably
win
it
yet
the
month
of
april
passed
away
without
the
occurrence
of
any
event
important
to
the
hanse
towns
the
inhabitants
of
which
vacillated
between
hope
and
fear
attacks
daily
took
place
between
parties
of
russian
and
french
troops
on
the
territory
between
lunenburg
and
bremen
in
one
of
these
encounters
general
morand
was
mortally
wounded
and
was
conveyed
to
lunenburg
his
brother
having
been
taken
prisoner
in
the
same
engagement
tettenborn
into
whose
hands
he
had
fallen
gave
him
leave
on
parole
to
visit
the
general
but
he
arrived
in
lunenburg
only
in
time
to
see
him
die
the
french
having
advanced
as
far
as
haarburg
took
up
their
position
on
the
plateau
of
schwartzenberg
which
commands
that
little
town
and
the
considerable
islands
situated
in
that
part
of
the
river
between
haarburg
and
hamburg
being
masters
of
this
elevated
point
they
began
to
threaten
hamburg
and
to
attack
haarburg
these
attacks
were
directed
by
vandamme
of
all
our
generals
the
most
redoubtable
in
conquered
countries
he
was
a
native
of
cassel
in
flanders
and
had
acquired
a
high
reputation
for
severity
at
the
very
time
when
he
was
attacking
hamburg
napoleon
said
of
him
at
dresden
if
i
were
to
lose
vandamme
i
know
not
what
i
would
give
to
have
him
back
again
but
if
i
had
two
such
generals
i
should
be
obliged
to
shoot
one
of
them
it
must
be
confessed
that
one
was
quite
enough
as
soon
as
he
arrived
vandamme
sent
to
inform
tettenborn
that
if
he
did
not
immediately
liberate
the
brother
and
of
morand
both
of
whom
were
his
prisoners
he
would
burn
hamburg
tettenborn
replied
that
if
he
resorted
to
that
extremity
he
would
hang
them
both
on
the
top
of
michael
tower
where
he
might
have
a
view
of
them
this
energetic
answer
obliged
vandamme
to
restrain
his
fury
or
at
least
to
direct
it
to
other
objects
meanwhile
the
french
forces
daily
augmented
at
haarburg
vandamme
profiting
by
the
negligence
of
the
new
hanseatic
troops
who
had
the
defence
of
the
great
islands
of
the
elbe
attacked
them
one
night
in
the
month
of
may
this
happened
to
be
the
very
night
after
the
battle
of
lutzsn
where
both
sides
claimed
the
victory
and
te
deum
was
sung
in
the
two
hostile
camps
the
advance
of
the
french
turned
the
balance
of
opinion
in
favour
of
napoleon
who
was
in
fact
really
the
conqueror
on
a
field
of
battle
celebrated
nearly
two
centuries
before
by
the
victory
and
death
of
gustavus
adolphus
the
cossacks
of
the
elbe
could
not
sustain
the
shock
of
the
french
vandamme
repulsed
the
troops
who
defended
wilhelmsburg
the
largest
of
the
two
islands
and
easily
took
possession
of
the
smaller
one
fidden
of
which
the
point
nearest
the
right
bank
of
the
elbe
is
not
half
a
gunshot
distant
from
hamburg
the
of
may
was
a
fatal
day
to
the
people
of
hamburg
for
it
was
then
that
davoust
having
formed
his
junction
with
vandamme
appeared
at
the
head
of
a
corps
of
men
destined
to
reinforce
napoleon
grand
army
hamburg
could
not
hold
out
against
the
considerable
french
force
now
assembled
in
its
neighbourhood
tettenborn
had
it
is
true
received
a
reinforcement
of
prussians
and
swedes
but
still
what
resistance
could
he
offer
to
davoust
men
tettenborn
did
not
deceive
himself
as
to
the
weakness
of
the
allies
on
this
point
or
the
inutility
of
attempting
to
defend
the
city
he
yielded
to
the
entreaties
of
the
inhabitants
who
represented
to
him
that
further
resistance
must
be
attended
by
certain
ruin
he
accordingly
evacuated
hamburg
on
the
of
may
taking
with
him
his
hanseatic
legions
which
had
not
held
out
an
hour
in
the
islands
of
the
elbe
and
accompanied
by
the
swedish
doctor
von
hess
whose
imprudent
advice
was
the
chief
cause
of
all
the
disasters
to
which
the
unfortunate
city
lied
been
exposed
davoust
was
at
haarburg
where
he
received
the
deputies
from
hamburg
with
an
appearance
of
moderation
and
by
the
conditions
stipulated
at
this
conference
on
the
of
may
a
strong
detachment
of
danish
troops
occupied
hamburg
in
the
name
of
the
emperor
the
french
made
their
entrance
the
same
evening
and
occupied
the
posts
as
quietly
as
if
they
had
been
merely
changing
guard
the
inhabitants
made
not
a
shadow
of
resistance
not
a
drop
of
blood
was
issued
not
a
threat
nor
an
insult
was
interchanged
this
is
the
truth
but
the
truth
did
not
suit
napoleon
it
was
necessary
to
getup
a
pretext
for
revenge
and
accordingly
recourse
was
had
to
a
bulletin
which
proclaimed
to
france
and
europe
that
hamburg
had
been
taken
by
main
force
with
a
loss
of
some
hundred
men
but
for
this
imaginary
resistance
officially
announced
how
would
it
have
been
possible
to
justify
the
spoliations
and
exactions
which
ensued
the
dutch
general
hogendorff
became
governor
of
hamburg
in
lieu
of
carra
cyr
who
had
been
confined
at
osnabruck
since
his
precipitate
retreat
general
hogendorff
had
been
created
one
of
the
emperor
aides
de
camp
but
he
was
neither
a
rapp
a
lauriston
nor
a
duroc
the
inhabitants
were
required
to
pay
all
the
arrears
of
taxes
due
to
the
different
public
offices
during
the
seventy
days
that
the
french
had
been
absent
and
likewise
all
the
allowances
that
would
have
been
paid
to
the
troops
of
the
garrison
had
they
remained
in
hamburg
payment
was
also
demanded
of
the
arrears
for
the
quartering
of
troops
who
were
fifty
leagues
off
however
some
of
the
heads
of
the
government
departments
who
saw
and
understood
the
new
situation
of
the
french
at
hamburg
did
not
enforce
these
unjust
and
vexatious
measures
the
duties
on
registrations
were
reduced
pyonnier
director
of
the
customs
aware
of
the
peculiar
difficulty
of
his
situation
in
a
country
where
the
customs
were
held
in
abhorrence
observed
great
caution
and
moderation
in
collecting
the
duties
personal
examination
which
is
so
revolting
and
indecorous
especially
with
respect
to
females
was
suppressed
but
these
modifications
did
not
proceed
from
the
highest
quarter
they
were
due
to
the
good
sense
of
the
subordinate
agents
who
plainly
saw
that
if
the
empire
was
to
fall
it
would
not
be
owing
to
little
infractions
in
the
laws
of
proscription
against
coffee
and
rhubarb
if
the
regulations
became
less
vexatious
to
the
inhabitants
of
hamburg
it
was
not
the
same
with
the
business
of
the
the
old
manoeuvres
of
that
department
were
resumed
more
actively
than
ever
letters
were
opened
without
the
least
reserve
and
all
the
old
clerks
who
were
initiated
in
these
scandalous
proceedings
were
recalled
with
the
exception
of
the
registrations
and
the
customs
the
inquisitorial
system
which
had
so
long
oppressed
the
hanse
towns
was
renewed
and
yet
the
delegates
of
the
french
government
were
the
first
to
cry
out
the
people
of
hamburg
are
traitors
to
napoleon
for
in
spite
of
all
the
blessings
he
has
conferred
upon
them
they
do
not
say
with
the
latin
poet
nobis
haec
otia
fecit
but
all
that
passed
was
trifling
in
comparison
with
what
was
to
come
on
the
of
june
was
published
an
imperial
decree
dated
the
of
the
same
month
by
virtue
of
which
were
to
be
reaped
the
fruits
of
the
official
falsehood
contained
in
the
bulletin
above
mentioned
to
expiate
the
crime
of
rebellion
hamburg
was
required
to
pay
an
extraordinary
contribution
of
francs
and
lubeck
a
contribution
of
the
enormous
sum
levied
on
hamburg
was
to
be
paid
in
the
short
space
of
a
month
by
six
equal
instalments
either
in
money
or
bills
on
respectable
houses
in
paris
in
addition
to
this
the
new
prefect
of
hamburg
made
a
requisition
of
grain
and
provisions
of
every
kind
wines
sailcloth
masts
pitch
hemp
iron
copper
steel
in
short
everything
that
could
be
useful
for
the
supply
of
the
army
and
navy
but
while
these
exactions
were
made
on
property
in
hamburg
at
dresden
the
liberties
of
individuals
and
even
lives
were
attacked
on
the
of
june
napoleon
doubtless
blinded
by
the
false
reports
that
were
laid
before
him
gave
orders
for
making
out
a
list
of
the
inhabitants
of
hamburg
who
were
absent
from
the
city
he
allowed
them
only
a
fortnight
to
return
home
an
interval
too
short
to
enable
some
of
them
to
come
from
the
places
where
they
had
taken
refuge
they
consequently
remained
absent
beyond
the
given
time
victims
were
indispensable
but
assuredly
it
was
not
bonaparte
who
conceived
the
idea
of
hostages
to
answer
for
the
men
whom
prudence
kept
absent
of
this
charge
i
can
clear
his
memory
the
hostages
were
however
taken
and
were
declared
to
be
also
responsible
for
the
payment
of
the
contribution
of
in
hamburg
they
were
selected
from
among
the
most
respectable
and
wealthy
men
in
the
city
some
of
them
far
advanced
in
age
they
were
conveyed
to
the
old
castle
of
haarburg
on
the
left
bank
of
the
elbe
and
these
men
who
had
been
accustomed
to
all
the
comforts
of
life
were
deprived
even
of
necessaries
and
had
only
straw
to
lie
on
the
hostages
from
lubeck
were
taken
to
hamburg
they
were
placed
between
decks
on
board
an
old
ship
in
the
port
this
was
a
worthy
imitation
of
the
prison
hulks
of
england
on
the
of
july
there
was
issued
a
decree
which
was
published
in

merely
of

moment
had

whether
or
not
she
intended
entirely
to
desert
the
cause
of
napoleon
there
is
a
running
attack
in
erreurs
tome
ii
pp
on
all
this
part
of
the
memoirs
but
the
best
account
of
the
negotiations
between
france
austria
and
the
allies
will
be
found
in
metternich
vol
pp
metternich
with
good
reason
prides
himself
on
the
skill
with
which
he
gained
from
napoleon
the
exact
time
twenty
days
necessary
for
the
concentration
of
the
austrian
armies
whether
the
negotiations
were
consistent
with
good
faith
on
the
part
of
austria
is
another
matter
but
one
thing
seems
clear
the
austrian
marriage
ruined
napoleon
he
found
it
impossible
to
believe
that
the
monarch
who
had
given
him
his
daughter
would
strike
the
decisive
blow
against
him
without
this
belief
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
would
have
attacked
austria
before
she
could
have
collected
her
forces
and
metternich
seems
to
have
dreaded
the
result
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
prevent
napoleon
from
carrying
out
his
usual
system
of
leaving
an
army
of
observation
before
the
allied
armies
and
himself
turning
to
bohemia
to
deal
a
great
blow
at
us
the
effect
of
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
foresee
in
the
present
depressed
state
of
the
great
majority
of
our
men
metternich
vol
i
with
our
knowledge
of
how
napoleon
held
his
own
against
the
three
armies
at
dresden
we
may
safely
assume
that
he
would
have
crushed
austria
if
she
had
not
joined
him
or
disarmed
the
conduct
of
austria
was
natural
and
politic
but
it
was
only
successful
because
napoleon
believed
in
the
good
faith
of
the
emperor
francis
his
law
it
is
to
be
noted
that
austria
only
succeeded
in
getting
alexander
to
negotiate
on
the
implied
condition
that
the
negotiations
were
not
to
end
in
a
peace
with
france
see
metternich
vol
where
in
answer
to
the
question
as
to
what
would
become
of
their
cause
if
napoleon
accepted
the
austrian
mediation
he
says
that
if
napoleon
declines
austria
will
join
the
allies
if
napoleon
accepts
the
negotiations
will
most
certainly
show
napoleon
to
be
neither
wise
nor
just
and
then
the
result
will
be
the
same
in
any
case
we
shall
have
gained
the
necessary
time
to
bring
our
armies
into
such
positions
that
we
need
not
again
fear
a
separate
attack
on
any
one
of
them
and
from
which
we
may
ourselves
take
the
offensive
all
her
amicable
demonstrations
were
limited
to
an
offer
of
her
intervention
in
opening
negotiations
with
russia
accordingly
on
the
of
june
an
armistice
was
concluded
at
pleiswitz
which
was
to
last
till
the
of
july
and
was
finally
prolonged
to
the
of
august
the
first
overtures
after
the
conclusion
of
the
armistice
of
pleiswitz
determined
the
assembling
of
a
congress
at
prague
it
was
reported
at
the
time
that
the
allies
demanded
the
restoration
of
all
they
had
lost
since
that
is
to
say
since
the
campaign
of
ulm
in
this
demand
holland
and
the
hanse
towns
which
had
become
french
provinces
were
comprehended
but
we
should
still
have
retained
the
rhine
belgium
piedmont
nice
and
savoy
the
battle
of
vittoria
the
news
of
this
decisive
battle
increased
the
difficulty
of
the
french
plenipotentiaries
at
prague
and
raised
the
demands
of
the
allies
it
also
shook
the
confidence
of
those
who
remained
faithful
to
bourrienne
which
placed
the
whole
of
spain
at
the
disposal
of
the
english
the
retreat
of
suchet
upon
the
ebro
the
fear
of
seeing
the
army
of
spin
annihilated
were
enough
to
alter
the
opinions
of
those
counsellors
who
still
recommended
war
notwithstanding
napoleon
opposition
and
his
innate
disposition
to
acquire
glory
by
his
victories
probably
he
would
not
have
been
inaccessible
to
the
reiterated
representations
of
sensible
men
who
loved
their
country
france
therefore
has
to
reproach
his
advisers
at
this
juncture
general
moreau
arrived
it
has
been
said
that
he
came
at
the
solicitation
of
bernadotte
this
is
neither
true
nor
probable
in
the
first
place
there
never
was
any
intimacy
between
bernadotte
and
moreau
and
in
the
next
how
can
it
be
imagined
that
bernadotte
wished
to
see
moreau
emperor
but
this
question
is
at
once
put
at
rest
by
the
fact
that
in
the
interview
at
abo
the
emperor
of
russia
hinted
to
bernadotte
the
possibility
of
his
succeeding
napoleon
it
was
generally
reported
at
the
time
and
i
have
since
learnt
that
it
was
true
that
the
french
princes
of
the
house
of
bourbon
had
made
overtures
to
moreau
through
the
medium
of
general
willot
who
had
been
proscribed
on
the
fructidor
and
i
have
since
learned
from
an
authentic
source
that
general
moreau
who
was
then
at
baltimore
refused
to
support
the
bourbon
cause
moreau
yielded
only
to
his
desire
of
being
revenged
on
napoleon
and
he
found
death
where
he
could
not
find
glory
at
the
end
of
july
the
proceedings
of
the
congress
at
prague
were
no
further
advanced
than
at
the
time
of
its
assembling
far
from
cheering
the
french
with
the
prospect
of
a
peace
the
emperor
made
a
journey
to
mayence
the
empress
went
there
to
see
him
and
returned
to
paris
immediately
after
the
emperor
departure
napoleon
went
back
to
dresden
and
the
armistice
not
being
renewed
it
died
a
natural
death
on
the
of
august
the
day
appointed
for
its
expiration
a
fatal
event
immediately
followed
the
rupture
of
the
conferences
on
the
of
august
austria
wishing
to
gain
by
war
as
she
had
before
gained
by
alliances
declared
that
she
would
unite
her
forces
with
those
of
the
allies
on
the
very
opening
of
this
disastrous
campaign
general
jomini
went
over
to
the
enemy
jomini
belonged
to
the
staff
of
the
unfortunate
marshal
ney
who
was
beginning
to
execute
with
his
wonted
ability
the
orders
he
had
received
there
was
much
surprise
at
his
eagerness
to
profit
by
a
struggle
begun
under
such
melancholy
auspices
to
seek
a
fresh
fortune
which
promised
better
than
what
he
had
tried
under
our
flag
public
opinion
has
pronounced
judgment
on
jomini
it
was
on
the
of
august
not
the
that
metternich
announced
to
caulaincourt
napoleon
plenipotentiary
at
prague
that
austria
had
joined
the
allies
and
declared
war
with
france
at
midnight
on
august
metternich
had
despatched
the
passports
for
the
comte
louis
de
narbonne
napoleon
ambassador
and
the
war
manifesto
of
the
emperor
francis
then
he
had
the
beacons
lighted
which
had
been
prepared
from
prague
to
the
silesian
frontier
as
a
sign
of
the
breech
of
the
negotiations
and
the
right
power
of
the
allied
armies
to
cross
the
silesian
frontier
metternich
vol
i
p
the
first
actions
were
the
battle
of
dresden
which
took
place
seven
days
after
the
rupture
of
the
armistice
and
the
battle
in
which
vandamme
was
defeated
and
which
rendered
the
victory
of
dresden
unavailing
i
have
already
mentioned
that
moreau
was
killed
at
dresden
bavaria
was
no
sooner
rid
of
the
french
troops
than
she
raised
the
mask
and
ranged
herself
among
our
enemies
in
october
the
loss
of
the
battle
of
leipsic
decided
the
fate
of
france
the
saxon
army
which
had
long
remained
faithful
to
us
went
over
to
the
enemy
during
the
battle
prince
poniatowski
perished
at
the
battle
of
leipsic
in
an
attempt
to
pass
the
aster
i
will
here
mention
a
fact
which
occurred
before
duroc
departure
for
the
campaign
of
i
used
often
to
visit
him
at
the
pavilion
marsan
in
the
tuileries
where
he
lodged
one
forenoon
when
i
had
been
waiting
for
him
a
few
minutes
he
came
from
the
emperor
apartments
where
he
had
been
engaged
in
the
usual
business
he
was
in
his
as
soon
as
he
entered
he
pulled
off
his
coat
and
hat
and
laid
them
aside
i
have
just
had
a
conversation
with
the
emperor
about
you
said
he
say
nothing
to
anybody
have
patience
and
you
will
be
he
had
no
sooner
uttered
these
words
than
a
footman
entered
to
inform
him
that
the
emperor
wished
to
see
him
immediately
well
said
duroc
i
must
go
no
sooner
was
the
servant
gone
than
duroc
stamped
violently
on
the
floor
and
exclaimed
that
never
leaves
me
a
moment
rest
if
he
finds
i
have
five
minutes
to
myself
in
the
course
of
the
morning
he
is
sure
to
send
for
me
he
then
put
on
his
coat
and
returned
to
the
emperor
saying
another
time
you
shall
hear
what
i
have
to
tell
you
from
that
time
i
did
not
see
duroc
until
the
month
of
january
he
was
constantly
absent
from
paris
and
did
not
return
until
the
end
of
he
was
much
affected
at
the
result
of
the
campaign
but
his
confidence
in
napoleon
genius
kept
up
his
spirits
i
turned
the
conversation
from
this
subject
and
reminded
him
of
his
promise
to
tell
me
what
had
passed
between
the
emperor
and
himself
relative
tome
you
shall
hear
said
he
the
emperor
and
i
had
been
playing
at
billiards
and
between
ourselves
he
plays
very
badly
he
is
nothing
at
a
game
which
depends
on
skill
while
negligently
rolling
his
balls
about
he
muttered
these
words
you
ever
see
bourrienne
now
sire
he
sometimes
dines
with
me
on
diplomatic
and
he
looks
so
droll
in
his
of
lyons
manufacture
that
you
would
laugh
if
you
saw
him
does
he
say
respecting
the
new
regulation
for
the
confess
he
says
it
is
very
ridiculous
that
it
will
have
no
other
result
than
to
enable
the
lyons
manufacturers
to
get
rid
of
their
goods
that
forced
innovations
on
the
customs
of
a
nation
are
never
successful
that
is
always
the
way
with
bourrienne
he
is
never
pleased
with
anything
sire
he
is
apt
to
grumble
but
he
says
what
he
thinks
you
know
duroc
he
served
me
very
well
at
hamburg
he
raised
a
good
deal
of
money
for
me
he
is
a
man
who
understands
business
i
will
not
leave
him
unemployed
time
must
hang
heavily
on
his
hands
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
for
him
he
has
many
enemies
who
has
not
sire
complaints
against
him
were
transmitted
to
me
from
hamburg
but
the
letter
which
he
wrote
to
me
in
his
justification
opened
my
eyes
and
i
begin
to
think
that
savary
had
good
motives
for
defending
him
endeavours
are
made
to
dissuade
me
from
employing
him
but
i
shall
nevertheless
do
so
at
last
i
remember
that
it
was
he
who
first
informed
me
of
the
near
approach
of
the
war
which
we
are
now
engaged
in
i
forget
all
that
has
been
said
against
him
for
the
last
two
years
and
as
soon
as
peace
is
concluded
and
i
am
at
leisure
i
will
think
of
him
after
relating
to
me
this
conversation
duroc
said
you
must
of
course
feel
assured
that
i
said
all
i
think
of
you
and
i
will
take
an
opportunity
of
reminding
him
of
you
but
we
must
we
patient
adieu
my
dear
friend
we
must
set
off
speedily
and
heaven
knows
when
we
shall
be
back
again
i
wished
him
a
successful
campaign
and
a
speedy
return
alas
i
was
doomed
to
see
my
excellent
friend
only
once
again
next
to
the
death
of
duroc
the
loss
most
sincerely
regretted
during
the
campaign
of
was
that
of
prince
poniatowski
joseph
poniatowaki
a
nephew
of
stanislas
augustus
king
of
poland
was
born
at
warsaw
on
the
of
may
at
an
early
age
he
was
remarkable
for
his
patriotic
spirit
but
his
uncle
influence
gave
him
an
apparent
irresolution
which
rendered
him
suspected
by
some
of
the
parties
in
poland
after
his
uncle
had
acceded
to
the
confederation
of
targowitz
poniatowski
left
the
service
accompanied
by
most
of
his
principal
officers
but
when
in
the
poles
endeavoured
to
repulse
the
russians
he
again
repaired
to
the
polish
camp
and
entered
the
army
as
a
volunteer
his
noble
conduct
obtained
for
him
the
esteem
of
his
countrymen
kosciusko
gave
him
the
command
of
a
division
with
which
he
rendered
useful
services
during
the
two
sieges
of
warsaw
immediately
after
the
surrender
of
that
capital
poniatowski
went
to
vienna
he
refused
the
offers
of
catherine
and
paul
to
bear
arms
in
the
service
of
russia
poniatowaki
retired
to
his
estate
year
warsaw
where
he
lived
like
a
private
gentleman
until
the
creation
of
the
grand
duchy
of
warsaw
revived
the
hopes
of
the
polish
patriots
he
then
became
war
minister
the
archduke
ferdinand
having
come
in
with
austrian
troops
to
take
possession
of
the
duchy
of
warsaw
poniatowski
who
commanded
the
polish
troops
which
were
very
inferior
in
numbers
to
the
austrian
force
obliged
the
latter
rather
by
dint
of
skillful
maneuvering
than
by
fighting
to
evacuate
the
grand
duchy
he
pursued
them
into
galicia
as
far
as
cracow
after
this
honourable
campaign
he
continued
to
exercise
his
functions
as
minister
until
the
war
against
russia
again
summoned
him
to
the
head
of
the
polish
army
after
taking
part
in
all
the
events
of
that
war
which
was
attended
by
such
various
chances
poniatowaki
was
present
at
the
battle
of
leipsic
that
battle
which
commenced
on
the
of
october
the
anniversary
of
the
famous
battles
of
ulm
and
of
jena
lasted
four
days
and
decided
the
fate
of
europe
five
hundred
thousand
men
fought
on
a
surface
of
three
square
leagues
retreat
having
become
indispensable
napoleon
took
leave
at
leipsic
of
the
king
of
saxony
and
his
family
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
from
dresden
the
emperor
then
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
adieu
saxons
to
the
people
who
filled
the
where
the
king
of
saxony
resided
with
some
difficulty
and
after
passing
through
many
turnings
and
windings
he
gained
the
suburb
of
runstadt
and
left
leipsic
by
the
outer
gate
of
that
suburb
which
leads
to
the
bridge
of
the
elster
and
to
lindenau
the
bridge
was
blown
up
shortly
after
he
had
passed
it
and
that
event
utterly
prevented
the
retreat
of
the
part
of
the
army
which
was
on
the
left
bank
of
the
easter
and
which
fell
into
the
power
of
the
enemy
napoleon
was
at
the
time
accused
of
having
ordered
the
destruction
of
the
bridge
immediately
after
he
had
himself
passed
it
in
order
to
secure
his
own
personal
retreat
as
he
was
threatened
by
the
active
pursuit
of
the
enemy
the
english
journals
were
unanimous
on
this
point
and
to
counteract
this
opinion
which
was
very
general
an
article
was
inserted
in
the
before
passing
the
bridge
of
the
elster
napoleon
had
directed
poniatowski
in
concert
with
marshal
macdonald
to
cover
and
protect
the
retreat
and
to
defend
that
part
of
the
suburb
of
leipsic
which
is
nearest
to
the
borne
road
for
the
execution
of
these
orders
he
had
only
polish
infantry
he
was
in
this
desperate
situation
when
he
saw
the
french
columns
in
full
retreat
and
the
bridge
so
choked
up
with
their
artillery
and
waggons
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
passing
it
then
drawing
his
sword
and
turning
to
the
officers
who
were
near
him
he
said
here
we
must
fall
with
honour
at
the
head
of
a
small
party
of
cuirassiers
and
polish
officers
he
rushed
on
the
columns
of
the
allies
in
this
action
he
received
a
ball
in
his
left
arm
he
had
already
been
wounded
on
the
and
he
nevertheless
advanced
but
he
found
the
suburb
filled
with
allied
troops
the
allies
were
so
numerous
that
they
scarcely
perceived
the
losses
they
sustained
their
masses
pressed
down
upon
us
in
every
direction
and
it
was
impossible
that
victory
could
fail
to
be
with
them
their
success
however
would
have
been
less
decisive
had
it
not
been
for
the
defection
of
the
saxons
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
these
troops
having
moved
towards
the
enemy
as
if
intending
to
make
an
attack
turned
suddenly
around
and
opened
a
heavy
fire
of
artillery
and
musketry
on
the
columns
by
the
aids
of
which
they
had
a
few
moments
before
been
fighting
i
do
not
know
to
what
page
of
history
such
a
transaction
is
recorded
this
event
immediately
produced
a
great
difference
in
our
affairs
which
were
before
in
a
bad
enough
train
i
ought
here
mention
that
before
the
battle
the
emperor
dismissed
a
bavarian
division
which
still
remained
with
him
he
spoke
to
the
officers
in
terms
which
will
not
soon
be
effaced
from
their
memory
he
told
them
that
according
to
the
laws
of
war
they
were
his
prisoners
since
their
government
had
taken
part
against
him
but
that
he
could
not
forget
the
services
they
had
rendered
him
and
that
they
were
therefore
at
liberty
to
return
home
these
troops
left
the
army
where
they
were
much
esteemed
and
marched
for
bavaria
he
fought
his
way
through
them
and
received
another
wound
he
then
threw
himself
into
the
pleisse
which
was
the
first
river
he
came
to
aided
by
his
officers
he
gained
the
opposite
bank
leaving
his
horse
in
the
river
though
greatly
exhausted
he
mounted
another
and
gained
the
elster
by
passing
through
reichenbach
garden
which
was
situated
on
the
side
of
that
river
in
spite
of
the
steepness
of
the
banks
of
the
elster
at
that
part
the
prince
plunged
with
his
horse
into
the
river
both
man
and
horse
were
drowned
and
the
same
fate
was
shared
by
several
officers
who
followed
poniatawski
example
marshal
macdonald
was
luckily
one
of
those
who
escaped
five
days
after
a
fisherman
drew
the
body
of
the
prince
out
of
the
water
on
the
of
october
it
was
temporarily
interred
at
leipsic
with
all
the
honours
due
to
the
illustrious
deceased
a
modest
stone
marks
the
spot
where
the
body
of
the
prince
was
dragged
from
the
river
the
poles
expressed
a
wish
to
erect
a
monument
to
the
memory
of
their
countryman
in
the
garden
of
reichenbach
but
that
gentleman
declared
he
would
do
it
at
his
own
expense
which
he
did
the
monument
consists
of
a
beautiful
sarcophagus
surrounded
by
weeping
willows
the
body
of
the
prince
after
bring
embalmed
was
sent
in
the
following
year
to
warsaw
and
in
it
was
deposited
in

i
am

that
the

determined
to
treat
with

in
his

as
he
four
years
before
had
refused
to
treat
with
the
emperor
of

except
at
vienna
the
latter
sovereign
now
completely
raised
the
mask
and
declared
to
the
emperor
that
he
would
make
common
cause
with
russia
and
prussia
against
him
in
his
declaration
he
made
rise
of
the
singular
pretext
that
the
more
enemies
there
were
against
napoleon
there
would
be
the
greater
chance
of

stood
so

in

this

on

of

was
an
affair
of
no

importance
for
she
had
now

the
netherlands
the
danes
who
had
abandoned
us
the
spaniards
and
portuguese
whose
courage
and
hopes
were
revived
by
our
reverses
napoleon
had
arrayed
against
him
upwards
of
a
million
of
armed
men
among
them
too
were
the
neapolitans
with
murat
at
their
head
the
month
of
november
was
fatal
to
the
fortune
of
napoleon
in
all
parts
the
french
armies
were
repulsed
and
driven
back
upon
the
rhine
every
direction
the
allied
forces
advanced
towards
that
river
for
a
considerable
time
i
had
confidently
anticipated
the
fall
of
the
empire
not
because
the
foreign
sovereigns
had
vowed
its
destruction
but
because
i
saw
the
impossibility
of
napoleon
defending
himself
against
all
europe
and
because
i
knew
that
however
desperate
might
be
his
fortune
nothing
would
induce
him
to
consent
to
conditions
which
he
considered
disgraceful
at
this
time
every
day
was
marked
by
a
new
defection
even
the
bavarians
the
natural
allies
of
france
they
whom
the
emperor
had
led
to
victory
at
the
commencement
of
the
second
campaign
of
vienna
they
whom
he
had
as
it
were
adopted
on
the
field
of
battle
were
now
against
us
and
were
the
bitterest
of
our
enemies
even
before
the
battle
of
leipsic
the
consequences
of
which
were
so
ruinous
to
napoleon
he
had
felt
the
necessity
of
applying
to
france
for
a
supply
of
troops
as
if
france
had
been
inexhaustible
he
directed
the
empress
regent
to
make
this
demand
and
accordingly
maria
louisa
proceeded
to
the
senate
for
the
first
time
in
great
state
but
the
glories
of
the
empire
were
now
on
the
decline
the
empress
obtained
a
levy
of
troops
but
they
were
no
sooner
enrolled
than
they
were
sacrificed
the
defection
of
the
bavarians
considerably
augmented
the
difficulties
which
assailed
the
wreck
of
the
army
that
had
escaped
from
leipsic
the
bavarians
had
got
before
us
to
hanau
a
town
four
leagues
distant
from
frankfort
there
they
established
themselves
with
the
view
of
cutting
off
our
retreat
but
french
valour
was
roused
the
little
town
was
speedily
carried
and
the
bavarians
were
repulsed
with
considerable
loss
the
french
army
arrived
at
mayence
if
indeed
one
may
give
the
name
of
army
to
a
few
masses
of
men
destitute
dispirited
and
exhausted
by
fatigue
and
privation
on
the
arrival
of
the
troops
at
mayence
no
preparation
had
been
made
for
receiving
them
there
were
no
provisions
or
supplies
of
any
kind
and
as
the
climax
of
misfortune
infectious
epidemics
broke
out
amongst
the
men
all
the
accounts
i
received
concurred
in
assuring
me
that
their
situation
vas
dreadful
however
without
counting
the
wreck
which
escaped
from
the
disasters
of
leipsic
and
the
ravages
of
disease
without
including
the
men
which
had
been
raised
by
a
on
the
application
of
maria
louisa
the
emperor
still
possessed
good
troops
but
they
were
in
the
rear
scattered
along
the
elbe
shut
up
in
fortresses
such
as
dantzic
hamburg
torgau
and
spandau
such
was
the
horror
of
our
situation
that
if
on
the
one
hand
we
could
not
resolve
to
abandon
them
it
was
at
the
same
time
impossible
to
aid
them
in
france
a
universal
cry
was
raised
for
peace
at
whatever
price
it
could
be
purchased
in
this
state
of
things
it
may
be
said
that
the
year
was
more
fatal
to
napoleon
than
the
year
the
disasters
of
moscow
were
repaired
by
his
activity
and
the
sacrifices
of
france
but
the
disasters
of
leipsic
were
irreparable
i
shall
shortly
speak
of
some
negotiations
in
which
if
i
had
chosen
i
might
have
taken
a
part
after
the
battle
of
leipsic
in
which
france
lost
for
the
second
time
a
formidable
army
all
the
powers
allied
against
napoleon
declared
at
frankfort
on
the
of
november
that
they
would
never
break
the
bonds
which
united
them
that
henceforth
it
was
not
merely
a
continental
peace
but
a
general
peace
that
would
be
demanded
and
that
any
negotiation
not
having
a
general
peace
for
its
object
would
be
rejected
the
allied
powers
declared
that
france
was
to
be
confined
within
her
natural
limits
the
rhine
the
alps
and
the
pyrenees
this
was
all
that
was
to
remain
of
the
vast
empire
founded
by
napoleon
but
still
it
must
be
allowed
it
was
a
great
deal
after
the
many
disasters
france
had
experienced
and
when
she
was
menaced
with
invasion
by
numerous
and
victorious
armies
but
napoleon
could
not
accede
to
such
proposals
for
he
was
always
ready
to
yield
to
illusion
when
the
truth
was
not
satisfactory
to
him
according
to
the
proposals
of
the
allies
at
frankfort
germany
italy
and
spain
were
to
be
entirely
withdrawn
from
the
dominion
of
france
england
recognised
the
freedom
of
trade
and
navigation
and
there
appeared
no
reason
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
her
professed
willingness
to
make
great
sacrifices
to
promote
the
object
proposed
by
the
allies
but
to
these
offers
a
fatal
condition
was
added
namely
that
the
congress
should
meet
in
a
town
to
be
declared
neutral
on
the
right
bank
of
the
rhine
where
the
plenipotentiaries
of
all
the
belligerent
powers
were
to
assemble
but
the
course
of
the
war
was
not
to
be
impeded
by
these
negotiations
this
system
of
negotiating
and
advancing
was
a
realization
of
metternich
idea
copying
napoleon
own
former
procedure
let
us
hold
always
the
sword
in
one
head
and
the
olive
branch
in
the
other
always
ready
to
negotiate
but
only
negotiating
whilst
advancing
here
is
napoleon
system
may
he
find
enemies
who
will
carry
on
war
as
he
would
carry
it
on
himself
metternich
vol
ii
p
the
due
de
bassano
maret
who
was
still
minister
for
foreign
affairs
replied
by
order
of
napoleon
to
the
overtures
wade
by
the
allies
for
a
general
congress
and
stated
that
the
emperor
acceded
to
them
and
wished
mannheim
to
be
chosen
as
the
neutral
town
metternich
replied
in
a
note
dated
frankfort
the
of
november
stating
that
the
allies
felt
no
difficulty
in
acceding
to
napoleon
choice
of
mannheim
for
the
meeting
of
the
congress
but
as
de
bassano
letter
contained
no
mention
of
the
general
and
summary
bases
i
have
just
mentioned
and
which
had
been
communicated
to
de
aignan
at
frankfort
metternich
stated
that
the
allies
wished
the
emperor
napoleon
to
declare
his
determination
respecting
those
bases
in
order
that
insurmountable
difficulties
might
not
arrest
the
negotiations
at
their
very
outset
the
duke
of
vicenza
caulaincourt
who
had
just
succeeded
the
due
de
bassano
received
this
letter
trusting
to
the
declaration
of
frankfort
he
thought
he
would
be
justified
in
treating
on
those
bases
he
confidently
relied
on
the
consent
of
napoleon
but
the
allies
had
now
determined
not
to
grant
the
limits
accorded
by
that
declaration
caulaincourt
was
therefore
obliged
to
apply
for
fresh
powers
which
being
granted
he
replied
on
the
of
december
that
napoleon
accepted
the
fundamental
and
summary
bases
which
had
been
communicated
by
de
aignan
to
this
letter
metternich
answered
that
the
emperors
of
russia
and
austria
were
gratified
to
find
that
the
emperor
of
france
recognised
the
bases
judged
necessary
by
the
allies
that
the
two
sovereigns
would
communicate
without
delay
the
official
document
to
their
allies
and
that
they
were
convinced
that
immediately
on
receiving
their
reply
the
negotiations
might
be
opened
without
any
interruption
of
the
war
we
shall
now
see
the
reason
why
these
first
negotiations
came
to
no
result
in
the
month
of
october
the
allies
overthrew
the
colossal
edifice
denominated
the
french
empire
when
led
by
victory
to
the
banks
of
the
rhine
they
declared
their
wish
to
abstain
from
conquest
explained
their
intentions
and
manifested
an
unalterable
resolution
to
abide
by
them
this
determination
of
the
allies
induced
the
french
government
to
evince
pacific
intentions
napoleon
wished
by
an
apparent
desire
for
peace
to
justify
if
i
may
so
express
myself
in
the
eyes
of
his
subjects
the
necessity
of
new
sacrifices
which
according
to
his
proclamations
he
demanded
only
to
enable
him
to
obtain
peace
on
as
honourable
conditions
as
possible
but
the
truth
is
he
was
resolved
not
even
to
listen
to
the
offers
made
at
frankfort
he
always
represented
the
limits
of
the
rhine
as
merely
a
compensation
for
the
dismemberment
of
poland
and
the
immense
aggrandisement
of
the
english
possessions
in
asia
but
he
wanted
to
gain
time
and
if
possible
to
keep
the
allied
armies
on
the
right
bank
of
the
rhine
the
immense
levies
made
in
france
one
after
the
other
had
converted
the
conscription
into
a
sort
of
pressgang
men
employed
in
agriculture
and
manufactures
were
dragged
from
their
labours
and
the
people
began
to
express
their
dissatisfaction
at
the
measures
of
government
more
loudly
than
they
had
hitherto
ventured
to
do
yet
all
were
willing
to
make
another
effort
if
they
could
have
persuaded
themselves
that
the
emperor
would
henceforth
confine
his
thoughts
to
france
alone
napoleon
sent
caulaincourt
to
the
headquarters
of
the
allies
but
that
was
only
for
the
sake
of
gaining
time
and
inducing
a
belief
that
he
was
favourably
disposed
to
peace
the
allies
having
learned
the
immense
levies
of
troops
which
napoleon
was
making
and
being
well
acquainted
with
the
state
of
feeling
in
france
published
the
famous
manifesto
addressed
to
the
french
people
which
was
profusely
circulated
and
may
be
referred
to
as
a
warning
to
subjects
who
trust
to
the
promises
of
governments
the
good
faith
with
which
the
promises
in
the
manifesto
were
kept
may
be
judged
of
from
the
treaty
of
paris
in
the
meantime
the
manifesto
did
not
a
little
contribute
to
alienate
from
napoleon
those
who
were
yet
faithful
to
his
cause
for
by
believing
in
the
declarations
of
the
allies
they
saw
in
him
the
sole
obstacle
to
that
peace
which
france
so
ardently
desired
on
this
point
too
the
allies
were
not
wrong
and
i
confess
that
i
did
not
see
without
great
surprise
that
the
duc
de
rovigo
in
that
part
of
his
memoirs
where
he
mentions
this
manifesto
reproaches
those
who
framed
it
for
representing
the
emperor
as
a
madman
who
replied
to
overtures
of
peace
only
by
conscription
levies
after
all
i
do
not
intend
to
maintain
that
the
declaration
was
entirely
sincere
with
respect
to
the
future
it
certainly
was
not
switzerland
was
already
tampered
with
and
attempts
were
made
to
induce
her
to
permit
the
allied
troops
to
enter
france
by
the
bridge
of
bale
things
were
going
on
no
better
in
the
south
of
france
where
the
army
threatened
our
frontiers
by
the
pyrenees
and
already
occupied
pampeluna
and
at
the
same
time
the
internal
affairs
of
the
country
were
no
less
critical
than
its
external
position
it
was
in
vain
to
levy
troops
everything
essential
to
an
army
was
wanting
to
meet
the
most
pressing
demands
the
emperor
drew
out
from
the
immense
treasure
which
he
had
accumulated
in
the
cellars
and
galleries
of
the
pavillion
marsan
at
the
tuileries
these
were
speedily
swallowed
up
nevertheless
it
was
an
act
of
generosity
on
the
part
of
napoleon
and
i
never
could
understand
on
what
ground
the
legislative
body
complained
of
the
outlay
because
as
the
funds
did
not
proceed
from
the
budget
there
needed
no
financial
law
to
authorise
their
application
besides
why
did
these
rigid
legislators
who
while
fortune
smiled
on
bonaparte
dared
not
utter
a
word
on
the
subject
demand
previously
to
the
gratuitous
gift
just
mentioned
that
the
in
the
emperor
privy
puree
should
be
transferred
to
the
imperial
treasury
and
carried
to
the
public
accounts
why
did
they
wink
at
the
accumulation
in
the
tuileries
of
the
contributions
and
exactions
levied
in
conquered
countries
the
answer
is
plain
because
there
would
have
been
danger
in
opposing
it
amidst
the
difficulties
which
assailed
the
emperor
he
cast
his
eyes
on
de
talleyrand
but
it
being
required
as
a
condition
of
his
receiving
the
portfolio
of
foreign
affairs
that
he
should
resign
his
office
of
de
talleyrand
preferred
a
permanent
post
to
a
portfolio
which
the
caprice
of
a
moment
might
withdraw
i
have
been
informed
that
in
a
conversation
with
the
emperor
de
talleyrand
gave
him
the
extraordinary
advice
of
working
upon
the
ambition
of
the
english
family
of
wellesley
and
to
excite
in
the
mind
of
wellington
the
lustre
of
whose
reputation
was
now
dawning
ambitious
projects
which
would
have
embarrassed
the
coalition
napoleon
however
did
not
adopt
this
proposition
the
issue
of
which
he
thought
too
uncertain
and
above
all
too
remote
in
the
urgent
circumstances
in
which
it
stood
caulaincourt
was
then
made
minister
for
foreign
affairs
in
lieu
of
maret
who
was
appointed
secretary
of
state
an
office
much
better
suited
to
him
meanwhile
the
emperor
was
wholly
intent
on
the
means
of
repelling
the
attack
which
was
preparing
against
him
the
critical
circumstances
in
which
he
was
placed
seemed
to
restore
the
energy
which
time
had
in
some
measure
robbed
him
of
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
spain
and
resolved
to
bring
the
army
from
that
country
to
oppose
the
allies
whose
movements
indicated
their
intention
of
entering
france
by
switzerland
an
event
occurred
connected
with
this
subject
calculated
to
have
a
decided
influence
on
the
affairs
of
the
moment
namely
the
renunciation
by
joseph
king
of
spain
of
all
right
to
the
crown
to
be
followed
by
the
return
as
had
been
agreed
on
of
ferdinand
to
his
dominions
joseph
made
this
sacrifice
at
the
instigation
of
his
brother
the
treaty
was
signed
but
an
inconceivable
delay
occurred
in
its
execution
while
the
torrent
which
was
advancing
upon
france
rushed
forward
so
rapidly
that
the
treaty
could
not
be
carried
into
execution
ferdinand
it
is
true
his
throne
but
from
other
causes
the
emperor
was
deeply
interested
in
the
march
of
the
allies
it
was
important
to
destroy
the
bridge
of
bale
because
the
rhine
once
crossed
masses
of
the
enemy
would
be
thrown
into
france
at
this
time
i
had
close
relations
with
a
foreign
diplomat
whom
i
am
forbidden
by
discretion
to
name
he
told
me
that
the
enemy
was
advancing
towards
the
frontier
and
that
the
bridge
of
bale
would
not
be
destroyed
as
it
had
been
so
agreed
at
berne
where
the
allies
had
gained
the
day
this
astonished
me
because
i
knew
on
the
other
hand
from
a
person
who
ought
to
have
been
equally
well
informed
that
it
was
hoped
the
bridge
would
be
blown
up
being
much
interested
in
knowing
the
truth
i
sent
on
my
own
account
an
agent
to
bale
who
on
his
return
told
me
that
the
bridge
would
remain
on
the
of
december
the
legislative
body
was
convoked
it
was
on
a
wednesday
laine
was
under
regnier
a
committee
was
appointed
to
examine
and
report
on
the
communications
of
the
emperor
the
report
and
conclusions
of
the
committee
were
not
satisfactory
it
was
alleged
that
they
betrayed
a
revolutionary
tendency
of
which
laine
was
absurdly
accused
of
having
been
one
of
the
promoters
but
all
who
knew
him
must
have
been
convinced
of
the
falsehood
of
the
charge
the
emperor
ordered
the
report
to
be
seized
and
then
adjourned
the
legislative
body
those
who
attentively
observed
the
events
of
the
time
will
recollect
the
stupor
which
prevailed
in
paris
on
the
intelligence
of
this
seizure
and
of
the
adjournment
of
the
legislative
body
a
thousand
conjectures
were
started
as
to
what
new
occurrences
had
taken
place
abroad
but
nothing
satisfactory
was
learned
i
considered
this
a
great
mistake
who
can
doubt
that
if
the
legislative
body
had
taken
the
frank
and
noble
step
of
declaring
that
france
accepted
the
conditions
of
frankfort
they
would
not
have
been
listened
to
by
the
allies
but
the
words
you
are
dishonoured
if
you
cede
a
single
village
acquired
by
a
always
resounded
in
napoleon
ears
they
flattered
his
secret
thoughts
and
every
pacific
proposal
was
rejected
the
members
of
the
adjourned
legislative
body
went
as
usual
to
take
leave
of
the
emperor
who
received
them
on
a

great
refusing
to
hear
any
explanation

have
suppressed
your
address

began
abruptly
it
was
incendiary
i
called
you
round
me
to
do
good

have
done

intentioned
the
others
and
above
all

the
advocate

bourbons

your
departments
and
feel
that
my
eye
will
follow

humble
me

may
kill
me
but
you
shall
not
dishonour
me
you
make
remonstrances

this
a
time
when
the
stranger
invades
our
provinces
and
cossacks
are
ready
to
overflow
our
country
there
may
have
been
petty
abuses
i
never
connived
at
them
you
raynouard

said
that
prince
massena
robbed
a
man
at
marseilles
of
his
house
you
lie
the
general
took
possession
of
a
vacant
house
and
my
minister
shall
indemnify
the
proprietor
is
it
thus
that
you
dare
affront
a
marshal
of
france
who
has
bled
for
his
country
and
grown
gray
in
victory
why
did
you
not
make
your
complaints
in
private
to
me
i
would
have
done
you
justice
we
should
wash
our
dirty
linen
at
home
and
not
drag
it
out
before
the
world
you
call
yourselves
representatives
of
the
nation
it
is
not
true
you
are
only
deputies
of
the
departments
a
small
portion
of
the
state
inferior
to
the
senate
inferior
even
to
the
council
of
state
the
representatives
of
the
people
i
am
alone
the
representative
of
the
people
twice
have
of
french
called
me
to
the
throne
which
of
you
durst
undertake
such
a
burden
it
had
already
overwhelmed
ecrase
your
assemblies
and
your
conventions
your
vergniauds
and
your
guadets
your
jacobins
and
your
girondins
they
are
all
dead
what
who
are

authority
is
in
the
throne
and
what
is
the
throne
this
wooden
frame
covered
with
velvet
no
i
am
the
throne
you
have
added
wrong
to
reproaches
you
have
talked
of
concessions
concessions
that
even
my
enemies
dared
not
ask
i
suppose
if
they
asked
champaigne
you
would
have
had
me
give
them
la
brie
besides
but
in
four
months
i
will
conquer
peace
or
i
shall
be
dead
you
advise
how
dare
you
debate
of
such
high
matters
de
si
graves
interets
you
have
put
me
in
the
front
of
the
battle
as
the
cause
of
war
it
is
infamous
une
atrocite
in
all
your
committees
you
have
excluded
the
friends
of
government
extraordinary
commission
committee
of
finance
committee
of
the
address
all
all
my
enemies
laine
i
repeat
it
is
a
traitor
he
is
a
wicked
man
the
others
are
mere
intriguers
i
do
justice
to
the
but
the
factions
i
know
and
will
pursue
is
it
i
ask
again
is
it
while
the
enemy
is
in
france
that
you
should
have
done
this
but
nature
has
gifted
me
with
a
determined
courage
nothing
can
overcome
me
it
cost
my
pride
much
too
i
made
that
sacrifice
i
but
i
am
above
your
miserable
declamations
i
was
in
need
of
consolation
and
you
would
mortify
me
but
no
my
victories
shall
crush
your
clamours
in
three
months
we
shall
have
peace
and
you
shall
repent
your
folly
i
am
one
of
those
who
triumph
or
die
go
back
to
your
departments
if
any
one
of
you
dare
to
print
your
address
i
shall
publish
it
in
the
moniteur
with
notes
of
my
own
go
france
stands
in
more
need
of
me
than
i
do
of
france
i
bear
the
twelfths
of
you
in
my
heart
i
shall
nominate
the
deputies
to
the
two
series
which
are
vacant
and
i
shall
reduce
the
legislative
body
to
the
discharge
of
its
proper
duties
the
inhabitants
of
alsace
and
franche
comte
have
more
spirit
than
you
they
ask
me
for
arms
i
send
them
and
one
of
my
aides
de
camp
will
lead
them
against
the
enemy
in
after
conversations
he
said
of
the
legislative
body
that
its
members
never
came
to
paris
but
to
obtain
some
favours
they
importuned
the
ministers
from
morning
till
night
and
complained
if
they
were
not
immediately
satisfied
when
invited
to
dinner
they
burn
with
envy
at
the
splendour
they
see
before
them
i
heard
this
from
cambaceres
who
was
present
when
the
emperor
made
these
remarks

i
am
now
arrived
at
the
most
critical
period
in
napoleon
career
what
reflections
must
he
have
made
if
he
had
had
leisure
to
reflect
in
comparing
the
recollections
of
his
rising
glory
with
the
sad
picture
of
his
falling
fortune
what
a
contrast
presents
itself
when
we
compare
the
famous
flag
of
the
army
of
italy
which
the
youthful
conqueror
bonaparte
carried
to
the
directory
with
those
drooping
eagles
who
had
now
to
defend
the
aerie
whence
they
had
so
often
taken
flight
to
spread
their
triumphant
wings
over
europe
here
we
see
the
difference
between
liberty
and
absolute
power
napoleon
the
son
of
liberty
to
whom
he
owed
everything
had
disowned
his
mother
and
was
now
about
to
fall
those
glorious
triumphs
were
now
over
when
the
people
of
italy
consoled
themselves
for
defeat
and
submitted
to
the
magical
power
of
that
liberty
which
preceded
the
republican
armies
now
on
the
contrary
it
was
to
free
themselves
from
a
despotic
yoke
that
the
nations
of
europe
had
in
their
turn
taken
up
arms
and
were
preparing
to
invade
france
with
the
violation
of
the
swiss
territory
by
the
allied
armies
after
the
consent
of
the
cantons
is
connected
a
fact
of
great
importance
in
my
life
and
which
if
i
had
chosen
might
have
made
a
great
difference
in
my
destiny
on
tuesday
the
of
december
i
dined
with
my
old
friend
pierlot
and
on
leaving
home
i
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
where
i
might
be
found
in
case
i
should
be
wanted
at
nine
at
night
an
express
arrived
from
the
minister
of
police
desiring
me
to
come
immediately
to
his
office
i
confess
considering
the
circumstances
of
the
times
and
knowing
the
emperor
prejudices
against
me
such
a
request
coming
at
such
an
hour
made
me
feel
some
uneasiness
and
i
expected
nothing
less
then
a
journey
to
vincennes
the
due
de
rovigo
by
becoming
responsible
for
me
had
as
yet
warded
off
the
blow
and
the
supervision
to
which
the
emperor
had
subjected
me
thanks
to
the
good
offices
of
davoust
consisted
in
going
three
times
a
week
to
show
myself
to
savory
i
accordingly
having
first
borrowed
a
repaired
to
the
hotel
of
the
minister
of
police
i
was
ushered
into
a
room
and
when
i
entered
i
found
savary
waiting
for
me
he
was
in
full
costume
from
which
i
concluded
he
had
just
come
from
the
emperor
advancing
towards
me
with
an
air
which
showed
he
had
no
bad
news
to
communicate
he
thus
addressed
me
bourrienne
i
have
just
come
from
the
emperor
who
asked
me
where
you
were
i
told
him
you
were
in
paris
and
that
i
saw
you
often
continued
the
emperor
him
come
to
me
i
want
to
employ
him
it
is
three
years
since
he
has
had
anything
to
do
i
wish
to
send
him
as
minister
to
switzerland
but
he
must
set
off
directly
he
must
go
to
the
allies
he
understands
german
well
the
king
of
prussia
expressed
by
letter
satisfaction
at
his
conduct
towards
the
prussians
whom
the
war
forced
to
retire
to
hamburg
he
knows
prince
witgenstein
who
is
the
friend
of
the
king
of
prussia
and
probably
is
at
lorrach
he
will
see
all
the
germans
who
are
there
i
confidently
rely
on
him
and
believe
his
journey
will
have
a
good
result
caulaincourt
will
give
him
his
instructions
notwithstanding
my
extreme
surprise
at
this
communication
i
replied
without
hesitation
that
i
could
not
accept
the
mission
that
it
was
offered
too
late
it
perhaps
is
hoped
said
i
that
the
bridge
of
bale
will
be
destroyed
and
that
switzerland
will
preserve
her
neutrality
but
i
do
not
believe
any
such
thing
nay
more
i
know
positively
to
the
contrary
i
can
only
repeat
the
offer
comes
much
too
late
i
am
very
sorry
for
this
resolution
observed
savory
but
caulaincourt
will
perhaps
persuade
you
the
emperor
wishes
you
to
go
the
duo
de
vicence
at
one
he
will
acquaint
you
with
all
the
particulars
and
give
you
your
instructions
he
may
acquaint
me
with
whatever
be
chooses
but
i
will
not
go
to
lohraah
you
know
the
emperor
better
than
i
do
he
wishes
you
to
go
and
he
will
not
pardon
your
refusal
he
may
do
as
he
pleases
but
no
consideration
shall
induce
me
to
go
to
switzerland
you
are
wrong
but
you
will
reflect
on
the
matter
between
this
and
tomorrow
morning
night
will
bring
good
counsel
at
any
rate
do
not
fail
to
go
at
one
to
caulaincourt
he
expects
you
and
directions
will
be
given
to
admit
you
immediately
next
morning
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
call
on
de
talleyrand
i
told
him
what
had
taken
place
and
as
he
was
intimately
acquainted
with
caulaincourt
i
begged
him
to
speak
to
that
minister
in
favour
of
my
resolution
de
talleyrand
approved
of
my
determination
not
to
go
to
switzerland
and
at
one
precisely
i
proceeded
to
de
caulaincourt
he
told
me
all
he
had
been
instructed
to
say
from
the
manner
in
which
he
made
the
communication
i
concluded
that
he
himself
considered
the
proposed
mission
a
disagreeable
one
and
unlikely
to
be
attended
by
any
useful
result
i
observed
that
he
must
have
heard
from
savory
that
i
had
already
expressed
my
determination
to
decline
the
mission
which
the
emperor
had
been
pleased
to
offer
me
the
duc
de
vicence
then
in
a
very
friendly
way
detailed
the
reasons
which
ought
to
induce
me
to
accept
the
offer
and
did
not
disguise
from
me
that
by
persisting
in
my
determination
i
ran
the
risk
of
raising
doubts
as
to
my
opinions
and
future
intentions
i
replied
that
having
lived
for
three
years
as
a
private
individual
unconnected
with
public
affairs
i
should
have
no
influence
at
the
headquarters
of
the
allies
and
that
whatever
little
ability
i
might
be
supposed
to
possess
that
would
not
counterbalance
the
difficulties
of
my
situation
and
the
opinion
that
i
was
out
of
favour
i
added
that
i
should
appear
at
the
headquarters
without
any
decoration
without
even
that
of
the
cordon
of
the
legion
of
honour
to
which
the
emperor
attached
so
much
importance
and
the
want
of
which
would
almost
have
the
appearance
of
disgrace
and
i
said
that
these
trifles
however
slightly
valued
by
reasonable
men
were
not
as
he
well
knew
without
their
influence
on
the
men
with
whom
i
should
have
to
treat
if
that
be
all
replied
caulaincourt
the
obstacle
will
speedily
be
removed
i
am
authorised
by
the
emperor
to
tell
you
that
he
will
create
you
a
duke
and
give
you
the
grand
cordon
of
the
legion
of
honour
after
these
words
i
thought
i
was
dreaming
and
i
was
almost
inclined
to
believe
that
caulaincourt
was
jesting
with
me
however
the
offer
was
serious
and
i
will
not
deny
that
it
was
tempting
yet
i
nevertheless
persisted
in
the
refusal
i
had
given
at
length
after
some
further
conversation
and
renewed
but
useless
entreaties
on
the
part
of
de
caulaincourt
he
arose
which
was
a
signal
that
our
interview
was
terminated
i
acknowledge
i
remained
for
a
moment
in
doubt
how
to
act
for
i
felt
we
had
come
to
no
understanding
de
caulaincourt
advanced
slowly
towards
the
door
of
his
cabinet
if
i
went
away
without
knowing
his
opinion
i
had
done
nothing
addressing
him
therefore
by
his
surname
caulaincourt
said
i
you
have
frequently
assured
me
that
you
would
never
forget
the
services
i
rendered
to
you
and
your
family
at
a
time
when
i
possessed
some
influence
i
know
you
and
therefore
speak
to
you
without
disguise
i
do
not
now
address
myself
to
the
minister
but
to
caulaincourt
you
are
a
man
of
honour
and
i
can
open
my
heart
to
you
frankly
consider
the
embarrassing
situation
of
france
which
you
know
better
than
i
do
i
do
not
ask
you
for
your
secrets
but
i
myself
know
enough
i
will
tell
you
candidly
that
i
am
convinced
the
enemy
will
pass
the
rhine
in
a
few
days
the
emperor
has
been
deceived
i
should
not
have
time
to
reach
my
destination
and
i
should
be
laughed
at
my
correspondents
in
germany
have
made
me
acquainted
with
every
particular
now
caulaincourt
tell
me
honestly
if
you
were
in
my
place
and
i
in
yours
and
i
should
make
this
proposition
to
you
what
determination
would
you
adopt
i
observed
from
the
expression
of
caulaincourt
countenance
that
my
question
had
made
an
impression
on
him
and
affectionately
pressing
my
hand
he
said
i
would
do
as
you
do
enough
i
will
arrange
the
business
with
the
emperor
this
reply
seemed
to
remove
a
weight
from
my
mind
and
i
left
caulaincourt
with
feelings
of
gratitude
i
felt
fully
assured
that
he
would
settle
the
business
satisfactorily
and
in
this
conjecture
i
was
not
deceived
for
i
heard
no
more
of
the
matter
i
must
here
go
forward
a
year
to
relate
another
occurrence
in
which
the
due
de
vicence
and
i
were
concerned
when
in
march
the
king
appointed
me
prefect
of
police
de
caulaincourt
sent
to
me
a
confidential
person
to
inquire
whether
he
ran
any
risk
in
remaining
in
paris
or
whether
he
had
better
remove
he
had
been
told
that
his
name
was
inscribed
in
a
list
of
individuals
whom
i
had
received
orders
to
arrest
delighted
at
this
proof
of
confidence
i
returned
the
following
answer
by
the
due
de
vicence
messenger
tell
de
caulaincourt
that
i
do
not
know
where
he
lives
he
need
be
under
no
apprehension
i
will
answer
for
him
during
the
campaign
of
the
allies
after
driving
the
french
out
of
saxony
and
obliging
them
to
retreat
towards
the
rhine
besieged
hamburg
where
davoust
was
shut
up
with
a
garrison
of
men
resolutely
determined
to
make
it
a
second
saragossa
from
the
month
of
september
every
day
augmented
the
number
of
the
allied
troops
who
were
already
making
rapid
progress
on
the
left
bank
of
the
elbe
davoust
endeavoured
to
fortify
hamburg
an
so
extended
a
scale
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
most
experienced
military
men
it
would
have
required
a
garrison
of
men
to
defend
it
in
a
regular
and
protracted
siege
at
the
commencement
of
the
siege
davoust
lost
vandamme
who
was
killed
in
a
sortie
at
the
head
of
a
numerous
corps
which
was
inconsiderately
sacrificed
it
is
but
justice
to
admit
that
davoust
displayed
great
activity
in
the
defence
and
began
by
laying
in
large
supplies
vandamme
fought
under
grouchy
in
and
died
several
years
afterwards
this
killing
him
at
hamburg
is
one
of
the
curious
mistakes
seized
on
by
the
bonapartists
to
deny
the
authenticity
of
these
memoirs
general
bertrand
was
directed
to
construct
a
bridge
to
form
a
communication
between
hamburg
and
haarburg
by
joining
the
islands
of
the
elbe
to
the
continent
along
a
total
distance
of
about
two
leagues
this
bridge
was
to
be
built
of
wood
and
davoust
seized
upon
all
the
yards
to
supply
materials
for
its
construction
in
the
space
of
three
days
the
bridge
was
finished
it
was
a
very
magnificent
structure
its
length
being
toises
exclusive
of
the
lines
of
junction
formed
on
the
two
islands
the
inhabitants
were
dreadfully
oppressed
but
all
the
cruel
measures
and
precautions
of
the
french
were
ineffectual
for
the
allies
advanced
in
great
force
and
occupied
westphalia
which
movement
obliged
the
governor
of
hamburg
to
recall
to
the
town
the
different
detachments
scattered
round
hamburg
at
lubeck
the
departure
of
the
french
troops
was
marked
by
blood
before
they
evacuated
the
town
an
old
man
and
a
butcher
named
prahl
were
condemned
to
be
shot
the
butcher
crime
consisted
in
having
said
in
speaking
of
the
french
der
teufel
hohle
sie
the
devil
take
them
the
old
man
fortunately
escaped
his
threatened
fate
but
notwithstanding
the
entreaties
and
tears
of
the
inhabitants
the
sentence
upon
prahl
was
carried
into
execution
the
garrison
of
hamburg
was
composed
of
french
italian
and
dutch
troops
their
number
at
first
amounted
to
but
sickness
made
among
them
from
sixty
to
eighty
perished
daily
in
the
hospitals
when
the
garrison
evacuated
hamburg
in
may
it
was
reduced
to
about
men
in
the
month
of
december
provisions
began
to
diminish
and
there
was
no
possibility
of
renewing
the
supply
the
poor
were
first
of
all
made
to
leave
the
town
and
afterwards
all
persons
who
were
not
usefully
employed
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
estimate
at
the
number
of
persons
who
were
thus
exiled
the
colonel
commanding
the
gendarmerie
at
hamburg
notified
to
the
exiled
inhabitants
that
those
who
did
not
leave
the
town
within
the
prescribed
time
would
receive
fifty
blows
with
a
cane
and
afterwards
be
driven
out
but
if
penance
may
be
commuted
with
priests
so
it
may
with
gendarmes
delinquents
contrived
to
purchase
their
escape
from
the
bastinado
by
a
sum
of
money
and
french
gallantry
substituted
with
respect
to
females
the
birch
for
the
cane
i
saw
an
order
directing
all
female
servants
to
be
examined
as
to
their
health
unless
they
could
produce
certificates
from
their
masters
on
the
of
december
the
government
granted
hours
longer
to
persons
who
were
ordered
to
quit
the
town
and
two
days
after
this
indulgence
an
ordinance
was
published
declaring
that
those
who
should
return
to
the
town
after
once
leaving
it
were
to
be
considered
as
rebels
and
accomplices
of
the
enemy
and
as
such
condemned
to
death
by
a
prevotal
court
but
this
was
not
enough
at
the
end
of
december
people
without
distinction
of
sex
or
age
were
dragged
from
their
beds
and
conveyed
out
of
the
town
on
a
cold
night
when
the
thermometer
was
between
sixteen
or
eighteen
degrees
and
it
was
affirmed
that
several
old
men
perished
in
this
removal
those
who
survived
were
left
on
the
outside
of
the
altona
gates
at
altona
they
all
found
refuge
and
assistance
on
of
these
unfortunate
persons
were
received
in
the
house
of
rainville
formerly
aide
de
camp
to
dumouriez
and
who
left
france
together
with
that
general
his
house
which
was
at
holstein
was
usually
the
scene
of
brilliant
entertainments
but
it
was
converted
into
the
abode
of
misery
mourning
and
death
all
possible
attention
was
bestowed
on
the
unfortunate
outlaws
but
few
profited
by
it
and
what
is
worse
the
inhabitants
of
altona
suffered
for
their
generosity
many
of
the
unfortunate
persons
were
affected
with
the
epidemic
disease
which
was
raging
in
hamburg
and
which
in
consequence
broke
out
at
altona
all
means
of
raising
money
in
hamburg
being
exhausted
a
seizure
was
made
of
the
funds
of
the
bank
of
that
city
which
yet
contained
from
seven
to
eight
millions
of
marks
were
those
who
ordered
this
measure
not
aware
that
to
seize
on
the
funds
of
some
of
the
citizens
of
hamburg
was
an
injury
to
all
foreigners
who
had
funds
in
the
bank
such
is
a
brief
statement
of
the
vexations
and
cruelties
which
long
oppressed
this
unfortunate
city
napoleon
accused
hamburg
of
anglomania
and
by
ruining
her
he
thought
to
ruin
england
hamburg
feeble
and
bereft
of
her
sources

of

in
order
to
throw
together
all
that
i
have
to
say
about
the
viceroy
i
must
anticipate
the
order
of
time
after
the
campaign
of
when
eugene
revisited
italy
he
was
promptly
informed
of
the
more
than
doubtful
dispositions
of
austria
towards
france
he
then
made
preparations
for
raising
an
army
capable
of
defending
the
country
which
the
emperor
had
committed
to
his
safeguard
napoleon
was
fully
aware
how
much
advantage
he
would
derive
from
the
presence
on
the
northern
frontiers
of
italy
of
an
army
sufficiently
strong
to
harass
austria
in
case
she
should
draw
aside
the
transparent
veil
which
still
covered
her
policy
eugene
did
all
that
depended
on
him
to
meet
the
emperor
wishes
but
in
spite
of
his
efforts
the
army
of
italy
was
after
all
only
an
imaginary
army
to
those
who
could
compare
the
number
of
men
actually
enrolled
with
the
numbers
stated
in
the
lists
when
in
july
the
viceroy
was
informed
of
the
turn
taken
by
the
negotiations
at
the
shadow
of
a
congress
assembled
at
prague
he
had
no
longer
any
doubt
of
the
renewal
of
hostilities
and
foreseeing
an
attack
on
italy
he
resolved
as
speedily
as
possible
to
approach
the
frontiers
of
austria
he
had
succeeded
in
assembling
an
army
composed
of
french
and
italians
and
amounting
to
infantry
and
cavalry
on
the
renewal
of
hostilities
the
viceroy
headquarters
were
at
udine
down
to
the
month
of
april
he
succeeded
in
maintaining
a
formidable
attitude
and
in
defending
the
entrance
of
his
kingdom
by
dint
of
that
military
talent
which
was
to
be
expected
in
a
man
bred
in
the
great
school
of
napoleon
and
whom
the
army
looked
up
to
as
one
of
its
most
skillful
generals
during
the
great
and
unfortunate
events
of
all
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
germany
and
the
rhine
but
the
defection
of
murat
for
a
time
diverted
attention
to
italy
that
event
did
not
so
very
much
surprise
me
for
i
had
not
forgotten
my
conversation
with
the
king
of
naples
in
the
champs
elysees
with
which
i
have
made
the
reader
acquainted
at
first
defection
was
thought
incredible
by
every
one
and
it
highly
excited
bonaparte
indignation
another
defection
which
occurred
about
the
same
period
deeply
distressed
eugene
for
although
raised
to
the
rank
of
a
prince
and
almost
a
sovereign
he
was
still
a
man
and
an
excellent
man
he
was
united
to
the
princess
amelia
of
bavaria
who
was
as
amiable
and
as
much
beloved
as
he
and
he
had
the
deep
mortification
to
count
the
subjects
of
his
among
the
enemies
whom
he
would
probably
have
to
combat
fearing
lest
he
should
be
harassed
by
the
bavarians
on
the
side
of
the
tyrol
eugene
commenced
his
retrograde
movement
in
the
autumn
of
he
at
first
fell
back
on
the
tagliamento
and
successively
on
the
adige
on
reaching
that
river
the
army
of
italy
was
considerably
diminished
in
spite
of
all
eugene
care
of
his
troops
about
the
end
of
november
eugene
learned
that
a
neapolitan
corps
was
advancing
upon
upper
italy
part
taking
the
direction
of
rome
and
part
that
of
ancona
the
object
of
the
king
of
naples
was
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
of
europe
and
he
was
duped
by
the
promises
held
out
to
him
as
the
reward
of
his
treason
murat
seemed
to
have
adopted
the
artful
policy
of
austria
for
not
only
had
he
determined
to
join
the
coalition
but
he
was
even
maintaining
communications
with
england
and
austria
while
at
the
same
time
he
was
making
protestations
of
fidelity
to
his
engagements
with
napoleon
when
first
informed
of
murat
treason
by
the
viceroy
the
emperor
refused
to
believe
it
no
he
exclaimed
to
those
about
him
it
can
not
be
murat
to
whom
i
have
given
my
sister
murat
to
whom
i
have
given
a
throne
eugene
must
be
misinformed
it
is
impossible
that
murat
has
declared
himself
against
me
it
was
however
not
only
possible
but
true
gradually
throwing
aside
the
dissimulation
beneath
which
he
had
concealed
his
designs
murat
seemed
inclined
to
renew
the
policy
of
italy
during
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
when
the
art
of
deceiving
was
deemed
by
the
italian
governments
the
most
sublime
effort
of
genius
without
any
declaration
of
war
murat
ordered
the
neapolitan
general
who
occupied
rome
to
assume
the
supreme
command
in
the
roman
states
and
to
take
possession
of
the
country
general
miollis
who
commanded
the
french
troops
in
rome
could
only
throw
himself
with
his
handful
of
men
into
the
castle
of
angelo
the
famous
mole
of
adrian
in
which
was
long
preserved
the
treasury
of
sixtus
the
french
general
soon
found
himself
blockaded
by
the
neapolitan
troops
who
also
blockaded
civita
vecchia
and
ancona
the
treaty
concluded
between
murat
and
austria
was
definitively
signed
on
the
of
january
as
soon
as
he
was
informed
of
it
the
viceroy
certain
that
he
should
soon
have
to
engage
with
the
neapolitans
was
obliged
to
renounce
the
preservation
of
the
line
of
the
adige
the
neapolitan
army
being
in
the
rear
of
his
right
wing
he
accordingly
ordered
a
retrograde
movement
to
the
other
side
of
the
mincio
where
his
army
was
cantoned
in
this
position
prince
eugene
on
the
of
february
had
to
engage
with
the
austrians
who
had
come
up
with
him
and
the
victory
of
the
mincio
arrested
for
some
time
the
invasion
of
the
austrian
army
and
its
junction
with
the
neapolitan
troops
it
was
not
until
eight
days
after
that
murat
officially
declared
war
against
the
emperor
and
immediately
several
general
and
superior
officers
and
many
french
troops
who
were
in
his
service
abandoned
him
and
repaired
to
the
headquarters
of
the
viceroy
murat
made
endeavours
to
detain
them
they
replied
that
as
he
had
declared
war
against
france
no
frenchman
who
loved
his
country
could
remain
in
his
service
do
you
think
returned
he
that
my
heart
is
lees
french
than
yours
on
the
contrary
i
am
much
to
be
pitied
i
hear
of
nothing
but
the
disasters
of
the
grand
army
i
have
been
obliged
to
enter
into
a
treaty
with
the
austrians
and
an
arrangement
with
the
english
commanded
by
lord
bentinck
in
order
to
save
my
kingdom
from
a
threatened
landing
of
the
english
and
the
sicilians
which
would
infallibly
have
excited
an
insurrection
there
could
not
be
a
more
ingenuous
confession
of
the
antipathy
which
joachim
knew
the
neapolitans
to
entertain
towards
his
person
and
government
his
address
to
the
french
was
ineffectual
it
was
easy
to
foresee
what
would
ensue
the
viceroy
soon
received
an
official
communication
from
napoleon
war
minister
accompanied
by
an
imperial
decree
recalling
all
the
french
who
were
in
the
service
of
joachim
and
declaring
that
all
who
were
taken
with
arms
in
their
hands
should
be
tried
by
a
courtmartial
as
traitors
to
their
country
murat
commenced
by
gaining
advantages
which
could
not
be
disputed
his
troops
almost
immediately
took
possession
of
leghorn
and
the
citadel
of
ancona
and
the
french
were
obliged
to
evacuate
tuscany
the
defection
of
murat
overthrew
one
of
bonaparte
gigantic
conceptions
he
had
planned
that
murat
and
eugene
with
their
combined
forces
should
march
on
the
rear
of
the
allies
while
he
disputing
the
soil
of
france
with
the
invaders
should
multiply
obstacles
to
their
advance
the
king
of
naples
and
the
viceroy
of
italy
were
to
march
upon
vienna
and
make
austria
tremble
in
the
heart
of
her
capital
before
the
timid
million
of
her
allies
who
measured
their
steps
as
they
approached
paris
should
desecrate
by
their
presence
the
capital
of
france
when
informed
of
the
vast
project
which
however
was
but
the
dream
of
a
moment
i
immediately
recognised
that
eagle
glance
that
power
of
discovering
great
resources
in
great
calamities
so
peculiar
to
bonaparte
napoleon
was
yet
emperor
of
france
but
he
who
had
imposed
on
all
europe
treaties
of
peace
no
less
disastrous
than
the
wars
which
had
preceded
them
could
not
now
obtain
an
armistice
and
caulaincourt
who
was
sent
to
treat
for
one
at
the
camp
of
the
allies
spent
twenty
days
at
luneville
before
he
could
even
obtain
permission
to
pass
the
advanced
posts
of
the
invading
army
in
vain
did
caulaincourt
entreat
napoleon
to
sacrifice
or
at
least
resign
temporarily
a
portion
of
that
glory
acquired
in
so
many
battles
and
which
nothing
could
efface
in
history
napoleon
replied
i
will
sign
whatever
you
wish
to
obtain
peace
i
will
exact
no
condition
but
i
will
not
dictate
my
own
humiliation
this
concession
of
course
amounted
to
a
determination
not
to
sign
or
to
grant
anything
in
the
first
fortnight
of
january
of
france
was
invaded
and
it
was
proposed
to
form
a
new
congress
to
be
held
at
seine
the
situation
of
napoleon
grew
daily
worse
and
worse
he
was
advised
to
seek
extraordinary
resources
in
the
interior
of
the
empire
and
was
reminded
of
the
fourteen
armies
which
rose
as
if
by
enchantment
to
defend
france
at
the
commencement
of
the
revolution
finally
a
reconciliation
with
the
jacobins
a
party
who
had
power
to
call
up
masses
to
aid
him
was
recommended
for
a
moment
he
was
inclined
to
adopt
this
advice
he
rode
on
horseback
through
the
surburbs
of
antoine
and
marceau
courted
the
populace
affectionately
replied
to
their
acclamations
and
he
thought
he
saw
the
possibility
of
turning
to
account
the
attachment
which
the
people
evinced
for
him
on
his
return
to
the
palace
some
prudent
persons
ventured
to
represent
to
him
that
instead
of
courting
this
absurd
sort
of
popularity
it
would
be
more
advisable
to
rely
on
the
nobility
and
the
higher
classes
of
society
gentlemen
replied
he
you
may
say
what
you
please
but
in
the
situation
in
which
i
stand
my
only
nobility
is
the
rabble
of
the
faubourgs
and
i
know
of
no
rabble
but
the
nobility
whom
i
have
created
this
was
a
strange
compliment
to
all
ranks
for
it
was
only
saying
that
they
were
all
rabble
together
at
this
time
the
jacobins
were
disposed
to
exert
every
effort
to
serve
him
but
they
required
to
have
their
own
way
and
to
be
allowed
freely
to
excite
and
foster
revolutionary
sentiments
the
press
which
groaned
under
the
most
odious
and
intolerable
censorship
was
to
be
wholly
resigned
to
them
i
do
not
state
these
facts
from
hearsay
i
happened
by
chance
to
be
present
at
two
conferences
in
which
were
set
forward
projects
infected
with
the
odour
of
the
clubs
and
these
projects
were
supported
with
the
more
assurance
because
their
success
was
regarded
as
certain
though
i
had
not
seen
napoleon
since
my
departure
for
hamburg
yet
i
was
sufficiently
assured
of
his
feeling
towards
the
jacobins
to
be
convinced
that
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
i
was
not
wrong
on
hearing
of
the
price
they
set
on
their
services
he
said
this
is
too
much
i
shall
have
a
chance
of
deliverance
in
battle
but
i
shall
have
none
with
these
furious
blockheads
there
can
be
nothing
in
common
between
the
demagogic
principles
of
and
the
monarchy
between
clubs
of
madmen
and
a
regular
ministry
between
a
committee
of
public
safety
and
an
emperor
between
revolutionary
tribunals
and
established
laws
if
fall
i
must
i
will
not
bequeath
france
to
the
revolution
from
which
i
have
delivered
her
these
were
golden
words
and
napoleon
thought
of
a
more
noble
and
truly
national
mode
of
parrying
the
danger
which
threatened
him
he
ordered
the
enrolment
of
the
national
guard
of
paris
which
was
placed
under
the
command
of
marshal
moncey
a
better
choice
could
not
have
been
made
but
the
staff
of
the
national
guard
was
a
focus
of
hidden
intrigues
in
which
the
defence
of
paris
was
less
thought
about
than
the
means
of
taking
advantage
of
napoleon
overthrow
i
was
made
a
captain
in
this
guard
and
like
the
rest
of
the
officers
i
was
summoned
to
the
tuileries
on
the
of
january
when
the
emperor
took
leave
of
the
national
guard
previously
to
his
departure
from
paris
to
join
the
army
napoleon
entered
with
the
empress
he
advanced
with
a
dignified
step
leading
by
the
hand
his
son
who
was
not
yet
three
years
old
it
was
long
since
i
had
seen
him
he
had
grown
very
corpulent
and
i
remarked
on
his
pale
countenance
an
expression
of
melancholy
and
irritability
the
habitual
movement
of
the
muscles
of
his
neck
was
more
decided
and
more
frequent
than
formerly
i
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
what
were
my
feelings
during
this
ceremony
when
i
again
saw
after
a
long
separation
the
friend
of
my
youth
who
had
become
master
of
europe
and
was
now
on
the
point
of
sinking
beneath
the
efforts
of
his
enemies
there
was
something
melancholy
in
this
solemn
and
impressive
ceremony
i
have
rarely
witnessed
such
profound
silence
in
so
numerous
an
assembly
at
length
napoleon
in
a
voice
as
firm
and
sonorous
as
when
he
used
to
harangue
his
troops
in
italy
or
in
egypt
but
without
that
air
of
confidence
which
then
beamed
on
his
countenance
delivered
to
the
assembled
officers
an
address
which
was
published
in
all
the
journals
of
the
time
at
the
commencement
of
this
address
he
said
i
set
out
this
night
to
take
the
command
of
the
army
on
quitting
the
capital
i
confidently
leave
behind
me
my
wife
and
my
son
in
whom
so
many
hopes
are
centred
i
listened
attentively
to
napoleon
address
and
though
he
delivered
it
firmly
he
either
felt
or
feigned
emotion
whether
or
not
the
emotion
was
sincere
on
his
part
it
was
shared
by
many
present
and
for
my
own
part
i
confess
that
my
feelings
were
deeply
moved
when
he
uttered
the
words
i
leave
you
my
wife
and
my
son
at
that
moment
my
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
young
prince
and
the
interest
with
which
he
inspired
me
was
equally
unconnected
with
the
splendour
which
surrounded
and
the
misfortunes
which
threatened
him
i
beheld
in
the
interesting
child
not
the
king
of
rome
but
the
son
of
my
old
friend
all
day
long
afterwards
i
could
not
help
feeling
depressed
while
comparing
the
farewell
scene
of
the
morning
with
the
day
on
which
we
took
possession
of
the
tuileries
how
many
centuries
seemed
the
fourteen
years
which
separated
the
two
events
it
may
be
worth
while
to
remind
those
who
are
curious
in
comparing
dates
that
napoleon
the
successor
of
louis
and
who
had
become
the
nephew
of
that
monarch
by
his
marriage
with
the
niece
of
marie
antoinette
took
leave
of
the
national
guard
of
paris
on
the
anniversary
of
the
fatal
of
january
after
years
of
successive
terror
fear
hope
glory
and
misfortune
meanwhile
a
congress
was
opened
at
at
which
were
assembled
the
duke
of
vicenza
on
the
part
of
france
lords
aderdeen
and
cathcart
and
sir
charles
stewart
as
the
representatives
of
england
count
razumowsky
on
the
part
of
russia
count
stadion
for
austria
and
count
humboldt
for
prussia
before
the
opening
of
the
congress
the
duke
of
vicenza
in
conformity
with
the
emperor
orders
demanded
an
armistice
which
is
almost
invariably
granted
during
negotiations
for
peace
but
it
was
now
too
late
the
allies
had
long
since
determined
not
to
listen
to
any
such
demand
they
therefore
answered
the
duke
of
application
by
requiring
that
the
propositions
for
peace
should
be
immediately
signed
but
these
were
not
the
propositions
of
frankfort
the
allies
established
as
their
bases
the
limits
of
the
old
french
monarchy
they
conceived
themselves
authorised
in
so
doing
by
their
success
and
by
their
situation
to
estimate
rightly
napoleon
conduct
during
the
negotiations
for
peace
which
took
place
in
the
conferences
at
chatillon
it
is
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
the
organisation
he
had
received
from
nature
and
the
ideas
with
which
that
organisation
had
imbued
him
at
an
early
period
of
life
if
the
last
negotiations
of
his
expiring
reign
be
examined
with
due
attention
and
impartiality
it
will
appear
evident
that
the
causes
of
his
fall
arose
out
of
his
character
i
can
not
range
myself
among
those
adulators
who
have
accused
the
persons
about
him
with
having
dissuaded
him
from
peace
did
he
not
say
at
helena
in
speaking
of
the
negotiations
at
chatillon
a
thunderbolt
alone
could
have
saved
us
to
treat
to
conclude
was
to
yield
foolishly
to
the
enemy
these
words
forcibly
portray
napoleon
character
it
must
also
be
borne
in
mind
how
much
he
was
captivated
by
the
immortality
of
the
great
names
which
history
has
bequeathed
to
our
admiration
and
which
are
perpetuated
from
generation
to
generation
napoleon
was
resolved
that
his
name
should
echo
in
ages
to
come
from
the
palace
to
the
cottage
to
live
without
fame
appeared
to
him
an
anticipated
death
if
however
in
this
thirst
for
glory
not
for
notoriety
he
conceived
the
wish
to
surpass
alexander
and
caesar
he
never
desired
the
renown
of
erostratus
and
i
will
say
again
what
i
have
said
before
that
if
he
committed
actions
to
be
condemned
it
was
because
he
considered
them
as
steps
which
helped
him
to
place
himself
on
the
summit
of
immortality
on
which
he
wished
to
place
his
name
witness
what
he
wrote
to
his
brother
jerome
better
never
to
have
lived
than
to
live
without
glory
witness
also
what
he
wrote
later
to
his
brother
louis
it
is
better
to
die
as
a
king
than
to
live
as
a
prince
how
often
in
the
days
of
my
intimacy
with
bonaparte
has
he
not
said
to
me
who
knows
the
names
of
those
kings
who
have
passed
from
the
thrones
on
which
chance
or
birth
seated
them
they
lived
and
died
unnoticed
the
learned
perhaps
may
find
them
mentioned
in
old
archives
and
a
medal
or
a
coin
dug
from
the
earth
may
reveal
to
antiquarians
the
existence
of
a
sovereign
of
whom
they
had
never
before
heard
but
on
the
contrary
when
we
hear
the
names
of
cyrus
alexander
caesar
mahomet
charlemagne
henry
and
louis
we
are
immediately
among
our
intimate
acquaintance
i
must
add
that
when
napoleon
thus
spoke
to
me
in
the
gardens
of
malmaison
he
only
repeated
what
had
often
fallen
from
him
in
his
youth
for
his
character
and
his
ideas
never
varied
the
change
was
in
the
objects
to
which
they
were
applied
from
his
boyhood
napoleon
was
fond
of
reading
the
history
of
the
great
men
of
antiquity
and
what
he
chiefly
sought
to
discover
was
the
means
by
which
those
men
had
become
great
he
remarked
that
military
glory
secures
more
extended
fame
than
the
arts
of
peace
and
the
noble
efforts
which
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
mankind
history
informs
us
that
great
military
talent
and
victory
often
give
the
power
which
in
its
tern
procures
the
means
of
gratifying
ambition
napoleon
was
always
persuaded
that
that
power
was
essential
to
him
in
order
to
bend
men
to
his
will
and
to
stifle
all
discussions
on
his
conduct
it
was
his
established
principle
never
to
sign
a
disadvantageous
peace
to
him
a
tarnished
crown
was
no
longer
a
crown
he
said
one
day
to
de
caulaincourt
who
was
pressing
him
to
consent
to
sacrifices
courage
may
defend
a
crown
but
infamy
never
in
all
the
last
acts
of
career
i
can
retrace
the
impress
of
his
character
as
i
had
often
recognised
in
the
great
actions
of
the
emperor
the
execution
of
a
thought
conceived
by
the
of
the
army
of
italy
on
the
opening
of
the
congress
the
duke
of
vicenza
convinced
that
he
could
no
longer
count
on
the
natural
limits
of
france
promised
at
frankfort
by
the
allies
demanded
new
powers
those
limits
were
doubtless
the
result
of
reasonable
concessions
and
they
had
been
granted
even
after
the
battle
of
leipsic
but
it
was
now
necessary
that
napoleon
minister
should
show
himself
ready
to
make
further
concessions
if
he
wished
to
be
allowed
to
negotiate
the
congress
was
opened
on
the
of
february
and
on
the
the
plenipotentiaries
of
the
allied
powers
declared
themselves
categorically
they
inserted
in
the
protocol
that
after
the
successes
which
had
favoured
their
armies
they
insisted
on
france
being
restored
to
her
old
limits
such
as
they
were
during
the
monarchy
before
the
revolution
and
that
she
should
renounce
all
direct
influence
beyond
her
future
limits
this
proposition
appeared
so
extraordinary
to
de
caulaincourt
that
he
requested
the
sitting
might
be
suspended
since
the
conditions
departed
too
far
from
his
instructions
to
enable
him
to
give
an
immediate
answer
the
plenipotentiaries
of
the
allied
powers
acceded
to
his
request
and
the
continuation
of
the
sitting
was
postponed
till
eight
in
the
evening
when
it
was
resumed
the
duke
of
vicenza
renewed
his
promise
to
make
the
greatest
sacrifices
for
the
attainment
of
peace
he
added
that
the
amount
of
the
sacrifices
necessarily
depended
on
the
amount
of
the
compensations
and
that
he
could
not
determine
on
any
concession
or
compensation
without
being
made
acquainted
with
the
whole
he
wished
to
have
a
general
plan
of
the
views
of
the
allies
and
he
requested
that
their
plenipotentiaries
would
explain
themselves
decidedly
respecting
the
number
and
description
of
the
sacrifices
and
compensations
to
be
demanded
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
duke
of
vicenza
perfectly
fulfilled
the
views
of
the
emperor
in
thus
protracting
and
gaining
time
by
subtle
subterfuges
for
all
that
he
suggested
had
already
been
done
on
the
day
after
this
sitting
some
advantages
gained
by
the
allies
who
took
and
troves
induced
napoleon
to
direct
caulaincourt
to
declare
to
the
congress
that
if
an
armistice
were
immediately
agreed
on
he
was
ready
to
consent
to
france
being
restored
to
her
old
limits
by
securing
this
armistice
napoleon
hoped
that
happy
chances
might
arise
and
that
intrigues
might
be
set
on
foot
but
the
allies
would
not
listen
to
any
such
proposition
at
the
sitting
of
the
of
march
the
duke
of
vicenza
inserted
in
the
protocol
that
the
last
courier
he
had
received
had
been
arrested
and
detained
a
considerable
time
by
several
russian
general
officers
who
had
obliged
him
to
deliver
up
his
despatches
which
had
not
been
returned
to
him
till
hours
after
at
chaumont
caulaincourt
justly
complained
of
this
infraction
of
the
law
of
nations
and
established
usage
which
he
said
was
the
sole
cause
of
the
delay
in
bringing
the
negotiations
to
a
conclusion
after
this
complaint
he
communicated
to
the
congress
the
ostensible
instructions
of
napoleon
in
which
he
authorised
his
minister
to
accede
to
the
demands
of
the
allies
but
in
making
this
communication
de
caulaincourt
took
care
not
to
explain
the
private
and
secret
instructions
he
had
also
received
the
allies
rejected
the
armistice
because
it
would
have
checked
their
victorious
advance
but
they
consented
to
sign
the
definitive
peace
which
of
all
things
was
what
the
emperor
did
not
wish
napoleon
at
length
determined
to
make
sacrifices
and
the
duke
of
vicenza
submitted
new
propositions
to
the
congress
the
allies
replied
in
the
same
sitting
that
these
propositions
contained
no
distinct
and
explicit
declaration
on
the
project
presented
by
them
on
the
of
february
that
having
on
the
of
the
same
month
demanded
a
decisive
answer
within
the
term
of
ton
days
they
were
about
to
break
up
the
negotiations
caulaincourt
then
declared
verbally
that
the
emperor
napoleon
was
ready
to
renounce
all
pretension
or
influence
whatever
in
countries
beyond
the
boundaries
of
france
to
recognise
the
independence
of
spain
italy
switzerland
germany
and
holland
and
that
as
to
england
france
would
make
such
concessions
as
might
be
deemed
necessary
in
consideration
of
a
reasonable
equivalent
upon
this
the
sitting
was
immediately
broken
up
without
a
reply
it
must
be
remarked
that
this
singular
declaration
was
verbal
and
consequently
not
binding
and
that
the
limits
of
france
were
mentioned
without
being
specified
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
napoleon
meant
the
limits
conceded
at
frankfort
to
which
he
was
well
convinced
the
allies
would
not
consent
for
circumstances
were
now
changed
besides
what
could
be
meant
by
the
reasonable
equivalent
from
england
is
it
astonishing
that
this
obscurity
and
vagueness
should
have
banished
all
confidence
on
the
part
of
the
plenipotentiaries
of
the
allied
powers
three
days
after
the
sitting
of
the
of
march
they
declared
they
could
not
even
enter
into
a
discussion
of
the
verbal
protocol
of
the
french
minister
they
requested
that
de
caulaincourt
would
declare
whether
he
would
accept
or
reject
the
project
of
a
treaty
presented
by
the
allied
sovereigns
or
offer
a
the
duke
of
vicenza
who
was
still
prohibited
by
secret
instructions
from
coming
to
any
conclusion
on
the
proposed
basis
inserted
in
the
protocol
of
the
sitting
of
the
of
march
a
very
ambiguous
note
the
plenipotentiaries
of
the
allies
in
their
reply
insisted
upon
receiving
another
declaration
from
the
french
plenipotentiary
which
should
contain
an
acceptance
or
refusal
of
their
project
of
a
treaty
presented
in
the
conference
of
the
of
february
or
a
after
much
discussion
caulaincourt
agreed
to
draw
up
a
which
he
presented
on
the
under
the
following
title
project
of
a
definitive
treaty
between
france
and
the
allies
in
this
extraordinary
project
presented
after
so
much
delay
de
caulaincourt
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
allies
departed
in
no
respect
from
the
declarations
of
the
of
march
he
replied
again
to
the
ultimatum
of
the
allies
or
what
be
wished
to
regard
as
such
by
defending
a
multitude
of
petty
interests
which
were
of
no
importance
in
so
great
a
contest
but
in
general
the
conditions
seemed
rather
those
of
a
conqueror
dictating
to
his
enemies
than
of
a
man
overwhelmed
by
misfortune
as
may
readily
be
imagined
they
were
for
the
most
part
received
with
derision
by
the
allies
everything
tends
to
prove
that
the
french
plenipotentiary
had
received
no
positive
instructions
from
the
of
february
and
that
after
all
the
delay
which
napoleon
constantly
created
caulaincourt
never
had
it
in
his
power
to
answer
categorically
the
propositions
of
the
allies
napoleon
never
intended
to
make
peace
at
chatillon
on
the
terms
proposed
he
always
hoped
that
some
fortunate
event
would
enable
him
to
obtain
more
favourable
conditions
on
the
of
march
that
is
to
say
three
days
after
the
presentation
of
this
project
of
a
treaty
the
plenipotentiaries
of
the
allies
recorded
in
the
protocol
their
reasons
for
rejecting
the
extraordinary
project
of
the
french
minister
for
my
part
i
was
convinced
for
the
reasons
i
have
mentioned
that
the
emperor
would
never
agree
to
sign
the
conditions
proposed
in
the
ultimatum
of
the
allies
dated
the
of
march
and
i
remember
having
expressed
that
opinion
to
de
talleyrand
i
saw
him
on
the
and
found
him
engaged
in
perusing
some
intelligence
he
had
just
received
from
the
duke
of
vicenza
announcing
as
beyond
all
doubt
the
early
signature
of
peace
caulaincourt
had
received
orders
to
come
to
a
conclusion
napoleon
he
said
had
given
him
a
carte
blanche
to
save
the
capital
and
avoid
a
battle
by
which
the
last
resources
of
the
nation
would
be
endangered
this
seemed
pretty
positive
to
be
sure
but
even
this
assurance
did
not
for
a
moment
alter
my
opinion
the
better
to
convince
me
de
talleyrand
gave
me
caulaincourt
letter
to
read
after
reading
it
i
confidently
said
he
will
never
sign
the
conditions
de
talleyrand
could
not
help
thinking
me
very
obstinate
in
my
opinion
for
he
judged
of
what
the
emperor
would
do
by
his
situation
while
i
judged
by
his
character
i
told
de
talleyrand
that
caulaincourt
might
have
received
written
orders
to
sign
for
the
sake
of
showing
them
to
the
plenipotentiaries
of
the
allies
but
that
i
had
no
doubt
he
had
been
instructed
to
postpone
coming
to
a
conclusion
and
to
wait
for
final
orders
i
added
that
i
saw
no
reason
to
change
my
opinion
and
that
i
continued
to
regard
the
breaking
up
of
the
congress
as
nearer
than
appearances
seemed
to
indicate
accordingly
three
days
afterwards
the
allies
grew
tired
of
the
delay
and
the
conferences
were
broken
up
thus
napoleon
sacrificed
everything
rather
than
his
glory
he
fell
from
a
great
height
but
he
never
by
his
signature
consented
to
any
dismemberment
of
france
the
plenipotentiaries
of
the
allies
convinced
that
these
renewed
difficulties
and
demands
had
no
other
object
but
to
gain
time
stated
that
the
allied
powers
faithful
to
their
principles
and
in
conformity
with
their
previous
declarations
regarded
the
negotiations
at
chatillon
as
terminated
by
the
french
government
this
rupture
of
the
conferences
took
place
on
the
of
march
six
days
after
the
presentation
of
the
ultimatum
of
the
allied
powers
the
issue
of
these
long
discussions
was
thus
left
to
be
decided
by
the
chances
of
war
which
were
not
very
favourable
to
the
man
who
boldly
contended
against
armed
europe
the
successes
of
the
allies
during
the
conferences
at
chatillon
had
opened
to
their
view
the
road
to
paris
while
napoleon
shrunk
from
the
necessity
of
signing
his
own
disgrace
in
these
circumstances
was
to
be
found
the
sole
cause
of
his
ruin
and
he
might
have
said
tout
est
perdu
fors
la
gloire
his
glory
is
immortal
the
conviviality
and
harmony
that
reigned
between
the
ministers
made
the
society
and
intercourse
at
chatillon
most
agreeable
the
diplomatists
dined
alternately
with
each
other
de
caulaincourt
liberally
passing
for
all
the
ministers
through
the
french
advanced
posts
convoys
of
all
the
good
cheer
in
epicurean
wises
that
paris
could
afford
nor
was
female
society
wanting
to
complete
the
charm
and
banish
ennui
from
the
chatillon
congress
which
i
am
sure
will
be
long
recollected
with
sensations
of
pleasure

the

i
was
always

and
everything
i
have
since
seen
has
confirmed
my
opinion
that
the
allies
entering
france
had
no
design
of
restoring
the
house
of
bourbon
or
of
imposing
any
government
whatever
on
the
french
people
they
came
to
destroy
and
not
to
found
that
which
they
wished
to
destroy
from
the
commencement
of
their
success
was
supremacy
in
order
to
prevent
the
future
invasions
with
which
they
believed
europe
would
still
be
constantly
threatened
if
indeed
i
had
entertained
any
doubt
on
this
subject
it
would
have
been
banished
by
the
account
i
heard
of
general
reynier
conversation
with
the
emperor
alexander
that
general
who
was
made
prisoner
at
leipsic
was
exchanged
and
returned
to
france
in
the
beginning
of
february
he
passed
through
troves
where
the
emperor
alexander
then
was
reynier
expressed
a
desire
to
be
allowed
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
emperor
and
to
thank
him
for
having
restored
him
to
liberty
he
was
received
with
that
affability
of
manner
which
was
sometimes
affected
by
the
russian
monarch
on
his
arrival
at
paris
general
reynier
called
at
the
duc
de
rovigo
where
i
had
dined
that
day
and
where
he
still
was
when
i
arrived
he
related
in
my
hearing
the
conversation
to
which
i
have
alluded
and
stated
that
it
had
all
the
appearance
of
sincerity
on
the
emperor
part
having
asked
alexander
whether
he
had
any
instructions
for
napoleon
as
the
latter
on
learning
that
he
had
seen
his
majesty
would
not
fail
to
ask
him
many
questions
he
replied
that
he
had
nothing
particular
to
communicate
to
him
alexander
added
that
he
was
napoleon
friend
but
that
he
had
personally
much
reason
to
complain
of
his
conduct
that
the
allies
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
that
they
had
no
intention
of
forcing
any
sovereign
upon
france
but
that
they
would
no
longer
acknowledge
napoleon
as
emperor
of
the
french
for
my
part
said
alexander
i
can
no
longer
place
any
confidence
in
him
he
has
deceived
me
too
often
in
reply
to
this
reynier
made
some
remarks
dictated
by
his
attachment
and
fidelity
to
bonaparte
he
observed
that
napoleon
was
acknowledged
as
sovereign
of
france
by
every
treaty
but
added
reynier
if
you
should
persist
in
forcing
him
to
resign
the
supreme
power
whom
will
you
put
in
his
place
did
you
not
choose
him
why
then
can
you
not
choose
some
one
else
to
govern
you
i
repeat
that
we
do
not
intend
to
force
any
one
upon
you
but
we
will
have
no
more
to
do
with
napoleon
several
generals
were
then
named
and
after
reynier
had
explained
the
great
difficulties
which
would
oppose
any
such
choice
alexander
interrupted
him
saying
but
general
there
is
bernadotte
has
he
not
been
voluntarily
chosen
prince
royal
of
sweden
may
he
not
also
be
raised
to
the
same
rank
in
france
he
is
your
countryman
surely
then
you
may
choose
him
since
the
swedes
took
him
though
a
foreigner
general
reynier
who
was
a
man
of
firm
character
started
some
objections
which
i
thought
at
the
time
well
founded
and
alexander
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
by
saving
rather
in
a
tone
of
dissatisfaction
well
general
the
fate
of
arms
will
decide
the
campaign
of
france
forced
napoleon
to
adopt
a
kind
of
operations
quite
new
to
him
he
had
been
accustomed
to
attack
but
he
was
now
obliged
to
stand
on
his
defence
so
that
instead
of
having
to
execute
a
previously
conceived
plan
as
when
in
the
cabinet
of
the
tuileries
he
traced
out
to
me
the
field
of
marengo
he
had
now
to
determine
his
movements
according
to
those
of
his
numerous
enemies
when
the
emperor
arrived
at
the
prussian
army
was
advancing
by
the
road
of
lorraine
he
drove
it
back
beyond
dizier
meanwhile
the
grand
army
passed
the
seine
and
the
yonne
at
montereau
and
even
sent
forward
a
corps
which
advanced
as
far
as
fontainebleau
napoleon
then
made
a
movement
to
the
right
in
order
to
drive
back
the
troops
which
threatened
to
march
on
paris
and
by
a
curious
chance
he
came
up
with
the
troops
in
the
very
place
where
he
passed
the
boyish
years
in
which
he
cherished
what
then
seemed
wild
and
fabulous
dreams
of
his
future
fate
what
thoughts
and
recollections
must
have
crowded
on
his
mind
when
he
found
himself
an
emperor
and
a
king
at
the
head
of
a
yet
powerful
army
in
the
chateau
of
the
comte
de
brienne
to
whom
he
had
so
often
paid
his
homage
it
was
at
brienne
that
he
had
said
to
me
years
before
i
will
do
these
frenchman
all
the
harm
i
can
since
then
he
had
certainly
changed
his
mind
but
it
might
be
said
that
fate
persisted
in
forcing
the
man
to
realise
the
design
of
the
boy
in
spite
of
himself
no
sooner
had
napoleon
revisited
brienne
as
a
conqueror
than
he
was
repulsed
and
hurried
to
his
fall
which
became
every
moment
more
certain
i
shall
not
enter
into
any
details
of
the
campaign
of
france
because
the
description
of
battles
forms
no
part
of
my
plan
still
i
think
it
indispensable
briefly
to
describe
napoleon
miraculous
activity
from
the
time
of
his
leaving
paris
to
the
entrance
of
the
allies
into
the
capital
few
successful
campaigns
have
enabled
our
generals
and
the
french
army
to
reap
so
much
glory
as
they
gained
during
this
great
reverse
of
fortune
for
it
is
possible
to
triumph
without
honour
and
to
fall
with
glory
the
chances
of
the
war
were
not
doubtful
but
certainly
the
numerous
hosts
of
the
allies
could
never
have
anticipated
so
long
and
brilliant
a
resistance
the
theatre
of
the
military
operations
soon
approached
so
near
to
paris
that
the
general
eagerness
for
news
from
the
army
was
speedily
satisfied
and
when
any
advantage
was
gained
by
the
emperor
his
partisans
saw
the
enemy
already
repulsed
from
the
french
territory
i
was
not
for
a
moment
deceived
by
these
illusions
as
i
well
knew
the
determination
and
the
resources
of
the
allied
sovereigns
besides
events
were
so
rapid
and
various
in
this
war
of
extermination
that
the
guns
of
the
invalides
announcing
a
victory
were
sometimes
immediately
followed
by
the
distant
rolling
of
artillery
denoting
the
enemy
near
approach
to
the
capital
the
emperor
left
paris
on
the
of
january
at
which
time
the
emperors
of
russia
and
austria
and
the
king
of
prussia
were
assembled
at
langres
napoleon
rejoined
his
guard
at
on
the
second
day
after
his
departure
he
drove
before
him
the
prussian
army
which
he
had
forced
to
evacuate
dizier
two
days
after
this
the
battle
of
brienne
was
fought
and
on
the
of
february
between
and
french
and
allied
troops
stood
face
to
face
on
this
occasion
the
commanders
on
both
sides
were
exposed
to
personal
danger
for
napoleon
had
a
horse
killed
under
him
and
a
cossack
fell
dead
by
the
side
of
marshal
blucher
a
few
days
after
this
battle
napoleon
entered
troves
where
he
stayed
but
a
short
time
and
then
advanced
to
champaubert
at
the
latter
place
was
fought
the
battle
which
bears
its
name
the
russians
were
defeated
general
alsufieff
was
made
prisoner
and
men
and
guns
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
french
after
this
battle
the
emperor
was
under
such
a
delusion
as
to
his
situation
that
while
supping
with
berthier
marmont
and
his
prisoner
general
alsufieff
the
emperor
said
another
such
victory
as
this
gentlemen
and
i
shall
be
on
the
vistula
finding
that
no
one
replied
and
reading
in
the
countenances
of
his
marshals
that
they
did
not
share
his
hopes
i
see
how
it
is
he
added
every
one
is
growing
tired
of
war
there
is
no
more
enthusiasm
the
sacred
fire
is
extinct
then
rising
from
the
table
and
stepping
up
to
general
drouot
with
the
marked
intention
of
paying
him
a
compliment
which
should
at
the
same
time
convey
a
censure
on
the
marshals
general
said
he
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
we
only
want
a
hundred
men
like
you
and
we
should
succeed
drouot
replied
with
great
presence
of
mind
and
modesty
rather
say
a
hundred
thousand
sire
this
anecdote
was
related
to
me
by
the
two
principal
persons
who
were
present
on
the
occasion
napoleon
soon
began
to
have
other
subjects
of
disquietude
besides
the
fate
of
battles
he
was
aware
that
since
the
beginning
of
february
the
duc
had
arrived
at
jean
de
luz
whence
he
had
addressed
s
proclamation
to
the
french
armies
in
the
name
of
his
uncle
louis
xviii
and
he
speedily
heard
of
the
comte
arrival
at
yesoul
on
the
of
february
which
place
he
did
not
leave
until
the
of
march
following
meanwhile
hostilities
were
maintained
with
increased
vigor
over
a
vast
line
of
operations
how
much
useless
glory
did
not
our
soldiers
gain
in
these
conflicts
in
spite
of
prodigies
of
valour
the
enemy
masses
advanced
and
gradually
concentrated
so
that
this
war
might
be
compared
to
the
battles
of
the
ravens
and
the
eagle
in
the
alps
the
eagle
slays
hundreds
of
his
assailants
every
blow
of
his
beak
is
the
death
of
an
enemy
but
still
the
vultures
return
to
the
charge
and
press
upon
the
eagle
until
they
destroy
him
as
the
month
of
february
drew
to
its
close
the
allies
were
in
retreat
on
several
points
but
their
retreat
was
not
a
rout
after
experiencing
reverses
they
fell
back
without
disorder
and
retired
behind
the
aube
where
they
rallied
and
obtained
numerous
reinforcements
which
daily
arrived
and
which
soon
enabled
them
to
resume
the
offensive
still
napoleon
continued
astonishing
europe
leagued
as
it
was
against
him
at
craonne
on
the
of
march
he
destroyed
blucher
corps
in
a
severe
action
but
the
victory
was
attended
by
great
loss
to
the
conqueror
marshal
victor
was
seriously
wounded
as
well
as
generals
grouchy
and
la
ferriere
while
napoleon
was
resisting
the
numerous
enemies
assembled
to
destroy
him
it
might
be
said
that
he
was
also
his
own
enemy
either
from
false
calculation
or
from
negligence
with
respect
to
his
illustrious
prisoners
who
on
his
departure
from
paris
had
not
yet
been
sent
to
their
states
the
pope
was
then
at
fontainebleau
and
the
princes
of
spain
at
valencay
the
pope
however
was
the
first
to
be
allowed
to
depart
surely
bonaparte
could
never
have
thought
of
the
service
which
the
pope
might
have
rendered
him
at
rome
into
which
murat
troops
would
never
have
dared
to
march
had
his
holiness
been
present
there
with
regard
to
the
spanish
princes
napoleon
must
have
been
greatly
blinded
by
confidence
in
his
fortune
to
have
so
long
believed
it
possible
to
retain
in
france
those
useless
trophies
of
defeated
pretensions
it
was
besides
so
easy
to
get
rid
of
the
exiles
of
valencay
by
sending
them
back
to
the
place
from
whence
they
had
been
brought
it
was
so
natural
to
recall
with
all
speed
the
troops
from
the
south
when
our
armies
in
germany
began
to
be
repulsed
on
the
rhine
and
even
driven
into
france
with
the
aid
of
these
veteran
troops
napoleon
and
his
genius
might
have
again
turned
the
scale
of
fortune
but
napoleon
reckoned
on
the
nation
and
he
was
wrong
for
the
nation
was
tired
of
him
his
cause
had
ceased
to
be
the
cause
of
france
the
latter
days
of
march
were
filled
up
by
a
series
of
calamities
to
napoleon
on
the
the
of
the
french
army
suffered
considerable
loss
to
hear
of
attacks
on
his
must
indeed
have
been
mortifying
to
napoleon
whose
advanced
guards
had
been
so
long
accustomed
to
open
the
path
of
victory
prince
schwartzenberg
soon
passed
the
aube
and
marched
upon
vitry
and
chalons
napoleon
counting
on
the
possibility
of
defending
paris
threw
himself
with
the
velocity
of
the
eagle
on
schwartzenberg
rear
by
passing
by
doulevant
and
he
pushed
forward
his
advanced
guards
to
chaumont
and
there
saw
the
austrian
army
make
a
movement
which
he
took
to
be
a
retreat
but
it
was
no
such
thing
the
movement
was
directed
on
paris
while
blucher
who
had
marched
to
meet
prince
schwartzenberg
and
napoleon
thinking
to
cut
off
their
retreat
was
himself
cut
off
from
the
possibility
of
returning
to
paris
everything
then
depended
on
the
defence
of
paris
or
to
speak
more
correctly
it
seemed
possible
by
sacrificing
the
capital
to
prolong
for
a
few
days
the
existence
of
the
phantom
of
the
empire
which
was
rapidly
vanishing
on
the
was
fought
the
battle
of
fere
champenoise
where
valour
yielding
to
numbers
marshals
marmont
and
mortier
were
obliged
to
retire
upon
sezanne
after
sustaining
considerable
loss
it
was
on
the
of
march
and
i
beg
the
reader
to
bear
this
date
in
mind
that
napoleon
suffered
a
loss
which
in
the
circumstances
in
which
he
stood
was
irreparable
at
the
battle
of
fere
champenoise
the
allies
captured
a
convoy
consisting
of
nearly
all
the
remaining
ammunition
and
stores
of
the
army
a
vast
quantity
of
arms
caissons
and
equipage
of
all
kinds
the
whole
became
the
prey
of
the
allies
who
published
a
bulletin
announcing
this
important
capture
a
copy
of
this
order
of
the
day
fell
into
the
hands
of
marshal
macdonald
who
thought
that
such
news
ought
immediately
to
be
communicated
to
the
emperor
he
therefore
repaired
himself
to
the
headquarters
of
napoleon
who
was
then
preparing
to
recover
which
was
occupied
by
the
prussians
the
marshal
with
the
view
of
dissuading
the
emperor
from
what
he
considered
a
vain
attempt
presented
him
with
the
bulletin
this
was
on
the
morning
of
the
napoleon
would
not
believe
the
news
no
said
he
to
the
marshal
you
are
deceived
this
can
not
be
true
then
perusing
the
bulletin
with
more
attention
here
said
he
look
yourself
this
is
the
and
the
bulletin
is
dated
the
you
see
the
thing
is
impossible
the
bulletin
is
forged
the
marshal
who
had
paid
more
attention
to
the
news
than
to
its
date
was
astounded
but
having
afterwards
shown
the
bulletin
to
drouot
that
general
said
alas
marshal
the
news
is
but
too
true
the
error
of
the
date
is
merely
a
misprint
the
is
a
inverted
on
what
trifles
sometimes
depend
the
most
important
events
an
inverted
cipher
sufficed
to
flatter
bonaparte
illusion
or
at
least
the
illusions
which
he
wished
to
maintain
among
his
most
distinguished
lieutenants
and
to
delay
the
moment
when
they
should
discover
that
the
loss
they
deplored
was
too
certain

classes
totally
distinct
from
each
other
among
these
patronised
men
were
many
who
had
been
the
first
patrons
of
bonaparte
and
had
favoured
his
accession
to
consular
power
this
class
was
composed
of
his
old
friends
and
former
the
others
who
may
be
called
the
children
of
the
empire
did
not
carry
back
their
thoughts
to
a
period
which
they
had
not
seen
they
had
never
known
anything
but
napoleon
and
the
empire
beyond
which
the
sphere
of
their
ideas
did
not
extend
while
among
napoleon
old
it
was
still
remembered
that
there
was
once
a
country
a
france
before
they
had
helped
to
give
it
a
master
to
this
class
of
men
france
was
not
confined
to
the
narrow
circle
of
the
imperial
headquarters
but
extended
to
the
rhine
the
alps
the
pyrenees
and
the
two
oceans
on
the
other
hand
numbers
of
ardent
and
adventurous
young
men
full
of
enthusiasm
for
bonaparte
had
passed
from
the
school
to
the
camp
they
were
entirely
opposed
to
napoleon
downfall
because
with
his
power
would
vanish
those
dreams
of
glory
and
fortune
which
had
captivated
their
imaginations
these
young
men
who
belonged
to
the
class
which
i
have
denominated
children
of
the
empire
were
prepared
to
risk
and
commit
everything
to
prolong
the
political
life
of
their
emperor
the
distinction
i
have
drawn
between
what
may
be
called
the
men
of
france
and
the
men
of
the
empire
was
not
confined
to
the
army
but
was
equally
marked
among
the
high
civil
functionaries
of
the
state
the
old
republicans
could
not
possibly
regard
napoleon
with
the
same
eyes
as
those
whose
elevation
dated
only
from
napoleon
and
the
members
of
assemblies
anterior
to
the
brumaire
could
not
entertain
the
same
ideas
as
those
whose
notions
of
national
franchises
and
public
rights
were
derived
from
their
seats
as
auditors
in
the
council
of
state
i
know
not
whether
this
distinction
between
the
men
of
two
different
periods
has
been
before
pointed
out
but
it
serves
to
explain
the
conduct
of
many
persons
of
elevated
rank
during
the
events
of
with
regard
to
myself
convinced
as
i
was
of
the
certainty
of
napoleon
fall
i
conceived
that
the
first
duty
of
every
citizen
was
claimed
by
his
country
and
although
i
may
incur
censure
i
candidly
avow
that
napoleon
treatment
of
me
during
the
last
four
years
of
his
power
was
not
without
some
influence
on
my
prompt
submission
to
the
government
which
succeeded
his
i
however
declare
that
this
consideration
was
not
the
sole
nor
the
most
powerful
motive
of
my
conduct
only
those
who
were
in
paris
at
the
period
of
the
capitulation
can
form
an
idea
of
the
violence
of
party
feeling
which
prevailed
there
both
for
and
against
napoleon
but
without
the
name
of
the
bourbons
ever
being
pronounced
they
were
almost
unknown
to
the
new
generation
forgotten
by
many
of
the
old
and
feared
by
the
conventionalists
at
that
time
they
possessed
only
the
frail
support
of
the
coteries
of
the
faubourg
germain
and
some
remains
of
the
emigration
but
as
it
is
certain
that
the
emigrants
could
offer
only
vain
demonstrations
and
wishes
in
support
of
the
old
family
of
our
kings
they
did
little
to
assist
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
another
thing
equally
certain
is
that
they
alone
by
their
follies
and
absurd
pretensions
brought
about
the
return
of
bonaparte
and
the
second
exile
of
louis
xviii
in
the
following
year
on
the
of
march
was
convoked
an
extraordinary
council
of
regency
at
which
maria
louisa
presided
the
question
discussed
was
whether
the
empress
should
remain
in
paris
or
proceed
to
blois
joseph
bonaparte
strongly
urged
her
departure
because
a
letter
from
the
emperor
had
directed
that
in
case
of
paris
being
threatened
the
and
all
the
council
of
regency
should
retire
to
blois
the
and
the
majority
of
the
council
were
of
the
same
opinion
but
one
of
the
most
influential
members
of
the
council
observed
to
joseph
that
the
letter
referred
to
had
been
written
under
circumstances
very
different
from
those
then
existing
and
that
it
was
important
the
empress
should
remain
in
paris
where
she
would
of
course
obtain
from
the
emperor
her
father
and
the
allied
sovereigns
more
advantageous
conditions
than
if
she
were
fifty
leagues
from
paris
the
adoption
of
this
opinion
would
only
have
retarded
for
a
few
days
a
change
which
had
become
inevitable
nevertheless
it
might
have
given
rise
to
great
difficulties
it
must
be
admitted
that
for
the
interests
of
napoleon
it
was
the
wisest
counsel
that
could
be
suggested
however
it
was
overruled
by
joseph
advice
de
talleyrand
as
a
member
of
the
council
of
regency
also
received
the
order
to
quit
paris
on
the
of
march
at
this
period
i
was
at
his
house
every
day
when
i
went
to
him
that
day
i
was
told
he
had
started
however
i
went
up
and
remained
some
time
in
his
hotel
with
several
of
his
friends
who
had
met
there
we
soon
saw
him
return
and
for
my
part
i
heard
with
satisfaction
that
they
had
not
allowed
him
to
pass
the
barriers
it
was
said
then
and
it
has
been
repeated
since
that
de
talleyrand
was
not
a
stranger
to
the
gentle
violence
used
towards
him
the
same
day
of
this
visit
to
de
talleyrand
i
also
went
to
see
the
duc
de
rovigo
savary
with
the
friendly
object
of
getting
him
to
remain
and
to
profit
by
his
position
to
prevent
disturbances
he
refused
without
hesitating
as
he
only
thought
of
the
emperor
i
found
him
by
his
fireside
where
there
was
a
large
file
in
which
he
was
burning
all
the
papers
which
might
have
compromised
every
one
who
had
served
his
ministry
police
i
congratulated
him
sincerely
on
this
loyal
occupation
fire
alone
could
purify
the
mass
of
filth
and
denunciations
which
encumbered
the
police
archives
on
the
departure
of
the
empress
many
persons
expected
a
popular
movement
in
favour
of
a
change
of
government
but
the
capital
remained
tranquil
many
of
the
inhabitants
indeed
thought
of
defence
not
for
the
sake
of
preserving
napoleon
government
but
merely
from
that
ardour
of
feeling
which
belongs
to
our
national
character
strong
indignation
was
excited
by
the
thought
of
seeing
foreigners
masters
of
paris
a
circumstance
of
which
there
had
been
no
example
since
the
reign
of
charles
vii
meanwhile
the
critical
moment
approached
on
the
of
march
marshals
marmont
and
mortier
fell
back
to
defend
the
approaches
to
paris
during
the
night
the
barriers
were
consigned
to
the
care
of
the
national
guard
and
not
a
foreigner
not
even
one
of
their
agents
was
allowed
to
enter
the
capital
at
daybreak
on
the
of
march
the
whole
population
of
paris
was
awakened
by
the
report
of
cannon
and
the
plain
of
denis
was
soon
covered
with
allied
troops
who
were
debouching
upon
it
from
all
points
the
heroic
valour
of
our
troops
was
unavailing
against
such
a
numerical
superiority
but
the
allies
paid
dearly
for
their
entrance
into
the
french
capital
the
national
guard
under
the
command
of
marshal
moncey
and
the
pupils
of
the
polytechnic
school
transformed
into
artillery
men
behaved
in
a
manner
worthy
of
veteran
troops
the
conduct
of
marmont
on
that
day
alone
would
suffice
to
immortalise
him
the
corps
he
commanded
was
reduced
to
between
and
infantry
and
cavalry
with
whom
for
the
space
of
twelve
hours
he
maintained
his
ground
against
an
army
of
men
of
whom
it
is
said
were
killed
wounded
and
taken
marshal
marmont
put
himself
so
forward
in
the
heat
of
the
battle
that
a
dozen
of
men
were
killed
by
the
bayonet
at
his
side
and
his
hat
was
perforated
by
a
ball
but
what
was
to
be
done
against
overwhelming
numbers
in
this
state
of
things
the
duke
of
ragusa
made
known
his
situation
to
joseph
bonaparte
who
authorised
him
to
negotiate
joseph
answer
is
so
important
in
reference
to
the
events
which
succeeded
that
i
will
transcribe
it
here
if
the
dukes
of
ragusa
and
treviso
can
no
longer
hold
out
they
are
authorised
to
negotiate
with
prince
schwartzenberg
and
the
emperor
of
russia
who
are
before
them
they
will
fall
back
on
the
loire
signed
joseph
montmartre
march
oclock
it
was
not
until
a
considerable
time
after
the
receipt
of
this
formal
authority
that
marmont
and
mortier
ceased
to
make
a
vigorous
resistance
against
the
allied
army
for
the
suspension
of
arms
was
not
agreed
upon
until
four
in
the
afternoon
it
was
not
waited
for
by
joseph
at
a
quarter
past
twelve
that
is
to
say
immediately
after
he
had
addressed
to
marmont
the
authority
just
alluded
to
joseph
repaired
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
to
regain
the
versailles
road
and
from
thence
to
proceed
to
rambouillet
the
precipitate
flight
of
joseph
astonished
only
those
who
did
not
know
him
i
know
for
a
fact
that
several
officers
attached
to
his
staff
were
much
dissatisfied
at
his
alacrity
on
this
occasion
in
these
circumstances
what
was
to
be
done
but
to
save
paris
which
there
was
no
possibility
of
defending
two
hours
longer
methinks
i
still
see
marmont
when
on
the
evening
of
the
of
march
he
returned
from
the
field
of
battle
to
his
hotel
in
the
rue
de
paradis
where
i
was
waiting
for
him
together
with
about
twenty
other
persons
among
whom
were
mm
perregaua
and
lafitte
when
he
entered
he
was
scarcely
recognisable
he
had
a
beard
of
eight
days
growth
the
greatcoat
which
covered
his
uniform
was
in
tatters
and
he
was
blackened
with
powder
from
head
to
foot
we
considered
what
was
best
to
be
done
and
all
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
signing
a
capitulation
the
marshal
must
recollect
that
the
exclamation
of
every
one
about
him
was
france
must
be
saved
mm
perregaus
and
lafitte
delivered
their
opinions
in
a
very
decided
way
and
it
will
readily
be
conceived
how
great
was
the
influence
of
two
men
who
were
at
the
head
of
the
financial
world
they
alleged
that
the
general
wish
of
the
parisians
which
nobody
had
a
better
opportunity
of
knowing
than
themselves
was
decidedly
averse
to
a
protracted
conflict
and
that
france
was
tired
of
the
yoke
of
bonaparte
this
last
declaration
gave
a
wider
range
to
the
business
under
consideration
the
question
was
no
longer
confined
to
the
capitulation
of
paris
but
a
change
in
the
government
was
thought
of
and
the
name
of
the
bourbons
was
pronounced
for
the
first
time
i
do
not
recollect
which
of
us
it
was
who
on
hearing
mention
made
of
the
possible
recall
of
the
old
dynasty
remarked
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
bring
about
a
restoration
without
retrograding
to
the
past
but
i
think
i
am
perfectly
correct
in
stating
that
lafitte
said
gentlemen
we
shall
have
nothing
to
fear
if
we
have
a
good
constitution
which
will
guarantee
the
rights
of
all
the
majority
of
the
meeting
concurred
in
this
wise
opinion
which
was
not
without
its
influence
on
marshal
marmont
during
this
painful
meeting
an
unexpected
incident
occurred
one
of
the
emperor
aides
de
camp
arrived
at
marmont
napoleon
being
informed
of
the
advance
of
the
allies
on
paris
had
marched
with
the
utmost
speed
from
the
banks
of
the
marne
on
the
road
of
fontainebleau
in
the
evening
he
was
in
person
at
froidmanteau
whence
he
despatched
his
envoy
to
marshal
marmont
from
the
language
of
the
aide
de
camp
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
the
state
of
opinion
at
the
imperial
headquarters
was
very
different
from
that
which
prevailed
among
the
population
of
paris
the
officer
expressed
indignation
at
the
very
idea
of
capitulating
and
he
announced
with
inconceivable
confidence
the
approaching
arrival
of
napoleon
in
paris
which
he
yet
hoped
to
save
from
the
occupation
of
the
enemy
the
officer
informed
us
that
napoleon
trusted
to
the
people
rising
in
spite
of
the
capitulation
and
that
they
would
unpave
the
streets
to
stone
the
allies
on
their
entrance
i
ventured
to
dissent
from
this
absurd
idea
of
defence
and
i
observed
that
it
was
madness
to
suppose
that
paris
could
resist
the
numerous
troops
who
were
ready
to
enter
on
the
following
day
that
the
suspension
of
arms
had
been
consented
to
by
the
allies
only
to
afford
time
for
drawing
up
a
more
regular
capitulation
and
that
the
armistice
could
not
be
broken
without
trampling
on
all
the
laws
of
honour
i
added
that
the
thoughts
of
the
people
were
directed
towards
a
better
future
that
the
french
were
tired
of
a
despotic
government
and
of
the
distress
to
which
continual
war
had
reduced
trade
and
industry
for
said
i
when
a
nation
is
sunk
to
such
a
state
of
misery
its
hopes
can
only
be
directed
towards
the
future
it
is
natural
they
should
be
so
directed
even
without
reflection
most
of
the
individuals
present
concurred
in
my
opinion
and
the
decision
of
the
meeting
was
unanimous
marshal
marmont
has
since
said
to
me
i
have
been
blamed
my
dear
bourrienne
but
you
were
with
me
on
the
of
march
you
were
a
witness
to
the
wishes
expressed
by
a
portion
of
the
principal
inhabitants
of
paris
i
acted
as
i
was
urged
to
do
only
because
i
considered
the
meeting
to
be
composed
of
men
entirely
disinterested
and
who
had
nothing
to
expect
from
the
return
of
the
bourbons
such
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
facts
which
some
persons
have
perverted
with
the
view
of
enhancing
napoleon
glory
with
respect
to
those
versions
which
differ
from
mine
i
have
only
one
comment
to
offer
which
is
that
i
saw
and
heard
what
i
describe
the
day
after
the
capitulation
of
paris
marmont
went
in
the
evening
to
see
the
emperor
at
fontainebleau
he
supped
with
him
napoleon
praised
his
defence
of
after
supper
the
marshal
rejoined
his
corps
at
essonne
and
six
hours
after
the
emperor
arrived
there
to
visit
the
lines
on
leaving
paris
marmont
had
left
colonels
fabvier
and
dent
to
direct
the
execution
of
the
capitulation
these
officers
joined
the
emperor
and
the
marshal
as
they
were
proceeding
up
the
banks
of
the
river
at
essonne
they
did
not
disguise
the
effect
which
the
entrance
of
the
allies
had
produced
in
paris
at
this
intelligence
the
emperor
was
deeply
mortified
and
he
returned
immediately
to
fontainebleau
leaving
the
marshal
at
essonne
at
daybreak
on
the
of
march
paris
presented
a
novel
and
curious
spectacle
no
sooner
had
the
french
troops
evacuated
the
capital
than
the
principal
streets
resounded
with
cries
of
down
with
bonaparte
no
conscription
no
consolidated
duties
droits
reunis
with
these
cries
were
mingled
that
of
the
bourbons
for
ever
but
this
latter
cry
was
not
repeated
so
frequently
as
the
others
in
general
i
remarked
that
the
people
gaped
and
listened
with
a
sort
of
indifference
as
i
had
taken
a
very
active
part
in
all
that
had
happened
during
some
preceding
days
i
was
particularly
curious
to
study
what
might
be
called
the
physiognomy
of
paris
this
was
the
second
opportunity
which
had
offered
itself
for
such
a
study
and
i
now
saw
the
people
applaud
the
fall
of
the
man
whom
they
had
received
with
enthusiasm
after
the
brumaire
the
reason
was
that
liberty
was
then
hoped
for
as
it
was
hoped
for
in
i
went
out
early
in
the
morning
to
see
the
numerous
groups
of
people
who
had
assembled
in
the
streets
i
saw
women
tearing
their
handkerchiefs
and
distributing
the
fragments
as
the
emblems
of
the
revived
lily
that
same
morning
i
met
on
the
boulevards
and
some
hours
afterwards
on
the
place
louis
a
party
of
gentlemen
who
paraded
the
streets
of
the
capital
proclaiming
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
and
shouting
vive
le
roi
and
vive
louis
xviii
at
their
head
i
recognised
mm
sosthenes
de
la
rochefoucauld
comte
de
froissard
the
duc
de
luxembourg
the
duc
de
crussol
seymour
etc
the
cavalcade
distributed
white
cockades
in
passing
along
and
was
speedily
joined
by
a
numerous
crowd
who
repaired
to
the
place
vendome
the
scene
that
was
acted
there
is
well
known
and
the
enthusiasm
of
popular
joy
could
scarcely
excuse
the
fury
that
was
directed
against
the
effigy
of
the
man
whose
misfortunes
whether
merited
or
not
should
have
protected
him
from
such
outrages
these
excesses
served
perhaps
more
than
is
generally
supposed
to
favour
the
plans
of
the
leaders
of
the
royalist
party
to
whom
nesselrode
had
declared
that
before
he
would
pledge
himself
to
further
their
views
he
must
have
proofs
that
they
were
seconded
by
the
population
of
paris
i
was
afterwards
informed
by
an
of
what
took
place
on
the
evening
of
the
of
march
in
one
of
the
principal
meetings
of
the
royalists
which
was
held
in
the
hotel
of
the
comte
de
morfontaine
who
acted
as
president
on
the
occasion
amidst
a
chaos
of
abortive
propositions
and
contradictory
motions
sosthenes
de
la
rochefoucauld
proposed
that
a
deputation
should
be
immediately
sent
to
the
emperor
alexander
to
express
to
him
the
wish
of
the
meeting
this
motion
was
immediately
approved
and
the
mover
was
chosen
to
head
the
deputation
on
leaving
the
hotel
the
deputation
met
de
chateaubriand
who
had
that
very
day
been
as
it
were
the
precursor
of
the
restoration
by
publishing
his
admirable
manifesto
entitled
bonaparte
and
the
bourbons
he
was
invited
to
join
the
deputation
but
nothing
could
overcome
his
diffidence
and
induce
him
to
speak
on
arriving
at
the
hotel
in
the
rue
florentin
the
deputation
was
introduced
to
count
nesselrode
to
whom
sosthenes
de
la
rochefoucauld
briefly
explained
its
object
he
spoke
of
the
wishes
of
the
meeting
and
of
the
manifest
desire
of
paris
and
of
france
he
represented
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
as
the
only
means
of
securing
the
peace
of
europe
and
observed
in
conclusion
that
as
the
exertions
of
the
day
must
have
been
very
fatiguing
to
the
emperor
the
deputation
would
not
solicit
the
favour
of
being
introduced
to
him
but
would
confidently
rely
on
the
good
faith
of
his
imperial
majesty
i
have
just
left
the
emperor
replied
nesselrode
and
can
pledge
myself
for
his
intentions
return
to
the
meeting
and
announce
to
the
french
people
that
in
compliance
with
their
wishes
his
imperial
majesty
will
use
all
his
influence
to
restore
the
crown
to
the
legitimate
monarch
his
majesty
louis
xviii
shall
reascend
the
throne
of
france
with
this
gratifying
intelligence
the
deputation
returned
to
the
meeting
in
the
rue
there
is
no
question
that
great
enthusiasm
was
displayed
on
the
entrance
of
the
allies
into
paris
it
may
be
praised
or
blamed
but
the
fact
can
not
be
denied
i
closely
watched
all
that
was
passing
and
i
observed
the
expression
of
a
sentiment
which
i
had
long
anticipated
when
after
his
alliance
with
the
daughter
of
the
caesars
the
ambition
of
bonaparte
increased
in
proportion
as
it
was
gratified
i
clearly
foresaw
fall
whoever
watched
the
course
of
events
during
the
last
four
years
of
the
empire
must
have
observed
as
i
did
that
from
the
date
of
marriage
with
maria
louisa
the
form
of
the
french
government
became
daily
more
and
more
tyrannical
and
oppressive
the
intolerable
height
which
this
evil
had
attained
is
evident
from
the
circumstance
that
at
the
end
of
the
legislative
body
throwing
aside
the
mute
character
which
it
had
hitherto
maintained
presumed
to
give
a
lecture
to
him
who
had
never
before
received
a
lecture
from
any
one
on
the
of
march
it
was
recollected
what
had
been
the
conduct
of
bonaparte
on
the
occasion
alluded
to
and
those
of
the
deputies
who
remained
in
paris
related
how
the
gendarmes
had
opposed
their
entrance
into
the
hall
of
the
assembly
all
this
contributed
wonderfully
to
irritate
the
public
mind
against
napoleon
he
had
become
master
of
france
by
the
sword
and
the
sword
being
sheathed
his
power
was
at
an
end
for
no
popular
institution
identified
with
the
nation
the
new
dynasty
which
he
hoped
to
found
the
nation
admired
but
did
not
love
napoleon
for
it
is
impossible
to
love
what
is
feared
and
he
had
done
nothing
to
claim
the
affections
of
france
i
was
present
at
all
the
meetings
and
conferences
which
were
held
at
m
de
talleyrand
hotel
where
the
emperor
alexander
had
taken
up
his
residence
of
all
the
persons
present
at
these
meetings
de
talleyrand
was
most
disposed
to
retain
napoleon
at
the
head
of
the
government
with
restrictions
on
the
exercise
of
his
power
in
the
existing
state
of
things
it
was
only
possible
to
choose
one
of
three
courses
first
to
make
peace
with
napoleon
with
the
adoption
of
proper
securities
against
him
second
to
establish
a
regency
and
third
to
recall
the
bourbons
on
the
of
march
i
witnessed
the
entrance
of
the
allied
sovereigns
into
paris
and
after
the
procession
had
passed
the
new
street
of
the
luxembourg
i
repaired
straight
to
de
talleyrand
hotel
which
i
reached
before
the
emperor
alexander
who
arrived
at
a
one
when
his
imperial
majesty
entered
de
talleyrand
most
of
the
persons
assembled
and
particularly
the
abbe
de
pradt
the
abbe
de
montesquieu
and
general
dessolles
urgently
demanded
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
the
emperor
did
not
come
to
any
immediate
decision
drawing
me
into
the
embrasure
of
a
window
which
looked
upon
the
street
he
made
some
observations
which
enabled
me
to
guess
what
would
be
his
determination
de
bourrienne
said
he
you
have
been
the
friend
of
napoleon
and
so
have
i
was
his
sincere
friend
but
there
is
no
possibility
of
remaining
at
peace
with
a
man
of
such
bad
faith
these
last
words
opened
my
eyes
and
when
the
different
propositions
which
were
made
came
under
discussion
i
saw
plainly
that
bonaparte
in
making
himself
emperor
had
made
up
the
bed
for
the
bourbons
a
discussion
ensued
on
the
three
possible
measures
which
i
have
above
mentioned
and
which
were
proposed
by
the
emperor
alexander
himself
i
thought
if
i
may
so
express
myself
that
his
majesty
was
playing
a
part
when
pretending
to
doubt
the
possibility
of
recalling
the
bourbons
which
he
wished
above
all
things
he
asked
de
talleyrand
what
means
he
proposed
to
employ
for
the
attainment
of
that
object
besides
the
french
there
were
present
at
this
meeting
the
emperor
alexander
the
king
of
prussia
prince
schwartzenberg
nesselrode
and
prince
liechtenstein
during
the
discussion
alexander
walked
about
with
some
appearance
of
agitation
gentlemen
said
he
addressing
us
in
an
elevated
tone
of
voice
you
know
that
it
was
not
i
who
commenced
the
war
you
know
that
napoleon
came
to
attack
me
in
my
dominions
but
we
are
not
drawn
here
by
the
thirst
of
conquest
or
the
desire
of
revenge
you
have
seen
the
precautions
i
have
taken
to
preserve
your
capital
the
wonder
of
the
arts
from
the
horrors
of
pillage
to
which
the
chances
of
war
would
have
consigned
it
neither
my
allies
nor
myself
are
engaged
in
a
war
of
reprisals
and
i
should
be
inconsolable
if
any
violence
were
committed
on
your
magnificent
city
we
are
not
waging
war
against
france
but
against
napoleon
and
the
enemies
of
french
liberty
william
and
you
prince
here
the
emperor
turned
towards
the
king
of
prussia
and
prince
schwartzenberg
who
represented
the
emperor
of
austria
you
can
both
bear
testimony
that
the
sentiments
i
express
are
yours
both
bowed
assent
to
this
observation
of
alexander
which
his
majesty
several
times
repeated
in
different
words
he
insisted
that
france
should
be
perfectly
free
and
declared
that
as
soon
as
the
wishes
of
the
country
were
understood
he
and
his
allies
would
support
them
without
seeking
to
favour
any
particular
government
the
abbe
de
pradt
then
declared
in
a
tone
of
conviction
that
we
were
all
royalists
and
that
the
sentiments
of
france
concurred
with
ours
the
emperor
alexander
adverting
to
the
different
governments
which
might
be
suitable
to
france
spoke
of
the
maintenance
of
bonaparte
on
the
throne
the
establishment
of
a
regency
the
choice
of
bernadotte
and
the
recall
of
the
bourbons
de
talleyrand
next
spoke
and
i
well
remember
his
saying
to
the
emperor
of
russia
sire
only
one
of
two
things
is
possible
we
must
either
have
bonaparte
or
louis
xviii
bonaparte
if
you
can
support
him
but
you
can
not
for
you
are
not
alone
we
will
not
have
another
soldier
in
his
stead
if
we
want
a
soldier
we
will
keep
the
one
we
have
he
is
the
first
in
the
world
after
him
any
other
who
may
be
proposed
would
not
have
ten
men
to
support
him
i
say
again
sire
either
bonaparte
or
louis
xviii
anything
else
is
an
intrigue
these
remarkable
words
of
the
prince
de
benevento
produced
on
the
mind
of
alexander
all
the
effect
we
could
hope
for
thus
the
question
was
simplified
being
reduced
now
to
only
two
alternatives
and
as
it
was
evident
that
alexander
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
either
napoleon
or
his
family
it
was
reduced
to
the
single
proposition
of
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
on
being
pressed
by
us
all
with
the
exception
of
de
talleyrand
who
still
wished
to
leave
the
question
undecided
between
bonaparte
and
louis
alexander
at
length
declared
that
he
would
no
longer
treat
with
napoleon
when
it
was
represented
to
him
that
that
declaration
referred
only
to
napoleon
personally
and
did
not
extend
to
his
family
he
added
nor
with
any
member
of
his
family
thus
as
early
as
the
of
march
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
might
be
considered
as
decided
i
can
not
omit
mentioning
the
hurry
with
which
laborie
whom
de
talleyrand
appointed
secretary
to
the
provisional
government
rushed
out
of
the
apartment
as
soon
as
he
got
possession
of
the
emperor
declaration
he
got
it
printed
with
such
expedition
that
in
the
space
of
an
hour
it
was
posted
on
all
the
walls
in
paris
and
it
certainly
produced
an
extraordinary
effect
as
yet
nothing
warranted
a
doubt
that
alexander
would
not
abide
by
his
word
the
treaty
of
paris
could
not
be
anticipated
and
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
france
with
a
new
government
would
obtain
more
advantageous
conditions
than
if
the
allies
had
treated
with
napoleon
but
this
illusion
speedily
vanished
on
the
evening
of
the
of
march
i
returned
to
de
talleyrand
i
again
saw
the
emperor
alexander
who
stepping
up
to
me
said
de
bourrienne
you
must
take
the
superintendence
of
the
department
i
could
not
decline
this
precise
invitation
on
the
part
of
the
czar
and
besides
lavalette
having
departed
on
the
preceding
day
the
business
would
have
been
for
a
time
suspended
a
circumstance
which
would
have
been
extremely
prejudicial
to
the
restoration
which
we
wished
to
favour
i
went
at
once
to
the
hotel
in
the
rue
rousseau
where
indeed
i
found
that
not
only
was
there
no
order
to
send
out
the
post
next
day
but
that
it
had
been
even
countermanded
i
went
that
night
to
the
administrators
who
yielded
to
my
requests
and
seconded
by
them
next
morning
i
got
all
the
clerks
to
be
at
their
post
i
reorganised
the
service
and
the
post
went
out
on
the
of
april
as
usual
such
are
my
remembrances
of
the
of
march
a
provisional
government
was
established
of
which
de
talleyrand
was
appointed
president
the
other
members
were
general
beurnonville
comte
francois
de
jaucourt
the
due
dalberg
who
had
married
one
of
maria
louisa
ladies
of
honour
and
the
abby
de
montesquieu
the
place
of
chancellor
of
the
legion
of
honour
was
given
to
the
abbe
de
pradt
thus
there
were
two
abbes
among
the
members
of
the
provisional
government
and
by
a
singular
chance
they
happened
to
be
the
same
who
had
officiated
at
the
mass
which
was
performed
in
the
champ
de
mars
on
the
day
of
the
first
federation
those
who
were
dissatisfied
with
the
events
of
the
of
march
now
saw
no
hope
but
in
the
possibility
that
the
emperor
of
austria
would
separate
from
his
allies
or
at
least
not
make
common
cause
with
them
in
favour
of
the
of
the
bourbons
but
that
monarch
had
been
brought
up
in
the
old
policy
of
his
family
and
was
imbued
with
the
traditional
principles
of
his
cabinet
i
know
for
a
fact
that
the
sentiments
and
intentions
of
the
emperor
of
austria
perfectly
coincided
with
those
of
his
allies
anxious
to
ascertain
the
truth
on
this
subject
i
ventured
when
in
conversation
with
the
emperor
alexander
to
hint
at
the
reports
i
had
heard
relative
to
the
cause
of
the
emperor
of
austria
absence
i
do
not
recollect
the
precise
words
of
his
majesty
answer
but
it
enabled
me
to
infer
with
certainty
that
francis
ii
was
in
no
way
averse
to
the
overthrow
of
his
and
that
his
absence
from
the
scene
of
the
discussions
was
only
occasioned
by
a
feeling
of
delicacy
natural
enough
in
his
situation
caulaincourt
who
was
sent
by
napoleon
to
the
headquarters
of
the
emperor
alexander
arrived
there
on
the
night
of
the
of
march
he
however
did
not
obtain
an
interview
with
the
czar
until
after
his
majesty
had
received
the
municipal
council
of
paris
at
the
head
of
which
was
de
chabrol
at
first
alexander
appeared
somewhat
surprised
to
see
the
municipal
council
which
he
did
not
receive
exactly
in
the
way
that
was
expected
but
this
coldness
was
merely
momentary
and
he
afterwards
addressed
the
council
in
a
very
gracious
way
though
he
dropped
no
hint
of
his
ulterior
intentions
alexander
who
entertained
a
personal
regard
for
caulaincourt
received
him
kindly
in
his
own
character
but
not
as
the
envoy
of
napoleon
you
have
come
too
late
said
the
czar
it
is
all
over
i
can
say
nothing
to
you
at
present
go
to
paris
and
i
will
see
you
there
these
words
perfectly
enlightened
caulaincourt
as
to
the
result
of
his
mission
his
next
interview
with
the
emperor
alexander
at
de
talleyrand
did
not
take
place
until
after
the
declaration
noticed
in
my
last
chapter
the
conversation
they
had
together
remained
a
secret
for
neither
alexander
nor
the
duke
of
vicenza
mentioned
it
but
there
was
reason
to
infer
from
some
words
which
fell
from
the
emperor
alexander
that
he
had
received
caulaincourt
rather
as
a
private
individual
than
as
the
ambassador
of
napoleon
whose
power
indeed
he
could
not
recognise
after
his
declaration
the
provisional
government
was
not
entirely
pleased
with
caulaincourt
presence
in
paris
and
a
representation
was
made
to
the
russian
emperor
on
the
subject
alexander
concurred
in
the
opinion
of
the
provisional
government
which
was
expressed
through
the
medium
of
the
abbe
de
pradt
de
caulaincourt
therefore
at
the
wish
of
the
czar

on
the
morning
of
the
of
march
while
the
battle
before
the
walls
of
paris
was
at
its
height
bonaparte
was
still
at
troyes
he
quitted
that
town
at
ten
accompanied
only
by
bertrand
caulaincourt
two
aides
de
camp
and
two
orderly
officers
he
was
not
more
than
two
hours
in
traveling
the
first
ten
leagues
and
he
and
his
slender
escort
performed
the
journey
without
changing
horses
and
without
even
alighting
they
arrived
at
sens
at
one
in
the
afternoon
everything
was
in
such
confusion
that
it
was
impossible
to
prepare
a
suitable
mode
of
conveyance
for
the
emperor
he
was
therefore
obliged
to
content
himself
with
a
wretched
cariole
and
in
this
equipage
about
four
in
the
morning
he
reached
froidmanteau
about
four
leagues
from
paris
it
was
there
that
the
emperor
received
from
general
belliard
who
arrived
at
the
head
of
a
column
of
artillery
the
first
intelligence
of
the
battle
of
paris
he
heard
the
news
with
an
air
of
composure
which
was
probably
affected
to
avoid
discouraging
those
about
him
he
walked
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
the
high
road
and
it
was
after
that
promenade
that
he
sent
caulaincourt
to
paris
napoleon
afterwards
went
to
the
house
of
the
postmaster
where
he
ordered
his
maps
to
be
brought
to
him
and
according
to
custom
marked
the
different
positions
of
the
enemy
troops
with
pine
the
heads
of
which
were
touched
with
wax
of
different
colours
after
this
description
of
work
which
napoleon
did
every
day
or
sometimes
several
times
a
day
he
repaired
to
fontainebleau
where
he
arrived
at
six
in
the
morning
he
did
not
order
the
great
apartments
of
the
castle
to
be
opened
but
went
up
to
his
favourite
little
apartment
where
he
shut
himself
up
and
remained
alone
during
the
whole
of
the
of
march
in
the
evening
the
emperor
sent
for
the
duke
of
ragusa
who
had
just
arrived
at
essonne
with
his
troops
the
duke
reached
fontainebleau
between
three
and
four
on
the
morning
of
the
of
april
napoleon
then
received
a
detailed
account
of
the
events
of
the
from
marmont
on
whose
gallant
conduct
before
paris
he
bestowed
much
praise
all
was
gloom
and
melancholy
at
fontainebleau
yet
the
emperor
still
retained
his
authority
and
i
have
been
informed
that
he
deliberated
for
some
time
as
to
whether
he
should
retire
behind
the
loire
or
immediately
hazard
a
bold
stroke
upon
paris
which
would
have
been
much
more
to
his
taste
than
to
resign
himself
to
the
chances
which
an
uncertain
temporising
might
bring
about
this
latter
thought
pleased
him
and
he
was
seriously
considering
his
plan
of
attack
when
the
news
of
the
and
the
unsuccessful
issue
of
caulaincourt
mission
gave
him
to
understand
that
his
situation
was
more
desperate
than
he
had
hitherto
imagined
meanwhile
the
heads
of
his
columns
which
the
emperor
had
left
at
troves
arrived
on
the
of
april
at
fontainebleau
the
troops
having
marched
fifty
leagues
in
less
than
three
days
one
of
the
most
rapid
marches
ever
performed
on
the
of
april
napoleon
communicated
the
events
of
paris
to
the
generals
who
were
about
him
recommending
them
to
conceal
the
news
lest
it
should
dispirit
the
troops
upon
whom
he
yet
relied
that
day
during
an
inspection
of
the
troops
which
took
place
in
the
court
of
the
palace
bonaparte
assembled
the
officers
of
his
guard
and
harangued
them
as
follows
soldiers
the
enemy
has
stolen
three
marches
upon
us
and
has
made
himself
master
of
paris
we
must
drive
him
thence
frenchmen
unworthy
of
the
name
emigrants
whom
we
have
pardoned
have
mounted
the
white
cockade
and
joined
the
enemy
the
wretches
shall
receive
the
reward
due
to
this
new
crime
let
us
swear
to
conquer
or
die
and
to
enforce
respect
to
the
cockade
which
has
for
twenty
years
accompanied
us
on
the
path
of
glory
and
honour
he
also
endeavoured
to
induce
the
generals
to
second
his
mad
designs
upon
paris
by
making
them
believe
that
he
had
made
sincere
efforts
to
conclude
peace
he
assured
them
that
he
had
expressed
to
the
emperor
alexander
his
willingness
to
purchase
it
by
sacrifices
that
he
had
consented
to
resign
even
the
conquests
made
during
the
revolution
and
to
confine
himself
within
the
old
limits
of
france
alexander
added
napoleon
refused
and
not
content
with
that
refusal
he
has
leagued
himself
with
a
party
of
emigrants
whom
perhaps
i
was
wrong
in
pardoning
for
having
borne
arms
against
france
through
their
perfidious
insinuations
alexander
has
permitted
the
white
cockade
to
be
mounted
on
the
capital
we
will
maintain
ours
and
in
a
few
days
we
will
march
upon
paris
i
rely
on
you
when
the
boundless
attachment
of
the
guards
to
the
emperor
is
considered
it
can
not
appear
surprising
that
these
last
words
uttered
in
an
impressive
tone
should
have
produced
a
feeling
of
enthusiasm
almost
electrical
in
all
to
whom
they
were
addressed
the
old
companions
of
the
glory
of
their
chief
exclaimed
with
one
voice
paris
paris
but
fortunately
during
the
night
the
generals
having
deliberated
with
each
other
saw
the
frightful
abyss
into
which
they
were
about
to
precipitate
france
they
therefore
resolved
to
intimate
in
discreet
terms
to
the
emperor
that
they
would
not
expose
paris
to
destruction
so
that
on
the
of
april
prudent
ideas
succeeded
the
inconsiderate
enthusiasm
of
the
preceding
day
the
wreck
of
the
army
assembled
at
fontainebleau
which
was
the
remnant
of
of
troops
levied
during
fifteen
months
consisted
only
of
the
corps
of
the
duke
of
reggio
oudinot
ney
macdonald
and
general
gerard
which
did
not
amount
to
men
and
which
joined
to
the
remaining
of
the
guard
did
not
leave
the
emperor
a
disposable
force
of
more
than
men
nothing
but
madness
or
despair
could
have
suggested
the
thought
of
subduing
with
such
scanty
resources
the
foreign
masses
which
occupied
and
surrounded
paris
on
the
of
april
the
senate
published
a
declaring
that
napoleon
had
forfeited
the
throne
and
abolishing
the
right
of
succession
which
had
been
established
in
favour
of
his
family
furnished
with
this
set
and
without
awaiting
the
concurrence
of
the
legislative
body
which
was
given
next
day
the
provisional
government
published
an
address
to
the
french
armies
in
this
address
the
troops
were
informed
that
they
were
no
longer
the
soldiers
of
napoleon
and
that
the
senate
released
them
from
their
oaths
these
documents
were
widely
circulated
at
the
time
and
inserted
in
all
the
public
journals
the
address
of
the
senate
was
sent
round
to
the
marshals
and
was
of
course
first
delivered
to
those
who
were
nearest
the
capital
of
this
latter
number
was
marmont
whose
allegiance
to
the
emperor
as
we
have
already
seen
yielded
only
to
the
sacred
interests
of
his
country
montessuis
was
directed
by
the
provisional
government
to
convey
the
address
to
marmont
and
to
use
such
arguments
as
were
calculated
to
strengthen
those
sentiments
which
had
triumphed
over
his
dearest
personal
affections
i
gave
montessuis
a
letter
to
marmont
in
which
i
said
my
dear
friend
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
will
convey
to
you
the
remembrances
of
our
friendship
he
will
i
trust
influence
your
resolution
a
single
word
will
suffice
to
induce
you
to
sacrifice
all
for
the
happiness
of
your
country
to
secure
that
object
you
who
are
so
good
a
frenchman
and
so
loyal
a
knight
will
not
fear
either
dangers
or
obstacles
your
friends
expect
you
long
for
you
and
i
trust
will
soon
embrace
you
montessuis
also
took
one
from
general
dessolles
whom
the
provisional
government
had
appointed
governor
of
the
national
guard
in
the
room
of
marshal
moncey
who
had
left
paris
on
the
occupation
of
the
allies
general
dessolles
and
i
did
not
communicate
to
each
other
our
correspondence
but
when
i
afterwards
saw
the
letter
of
deasolles
i
could
not
help
remarking
the
coincidence
of
our
appeal
to
marmont
patriotism
prince
schwartzenberg
also
wrote
to
marmont
to
induce
him
to
espouse
a
clause
which
had
now
become
the
cause
of
france
to
the
prince
letter
marmont
replied
that
he
was
disposed
to
concur
in
the
union
of
the
army
and
the
people
which
would
avert
all
chance
of
civil
war
and
stop
the
effusion
of
french
blood
and
that
he
was
ready
with
his
troops
to
quit
the
army
of
the
emperor
napoleon
on
the
condition
that
his
troops
might
retire
with
the
honours
of
war
and
that
the
safety
and
liberty
of
the
emperor
were
guaranteed
by
the
allies
after
prince
schwartzenberg
acceded
to
these
conditions
marmont
was
placed
in
circumstances
which
obliged
him
to
request
that
he
might
be
released
from
his
promise
i
happened
to
learn
the
manner
in
which
marshal
macdonald
was
informed
of
the
taking
of
paris
he
had
been
two
days
without
any
intelligence
from
the
emperor
when
he
received
an
order
in
the
handwriting
of
berthier
couched
in
the
following
terms
the
emperor
desires
that
you
halt
wherever
you
may
receive
this
order
after
berthier
signature
the
following
words
were
added
as
a
postscript
you
of
course
know
that
the
enemy
is
in
possession
of
paris
when
the
emperor
thus
announced
with
apparent
negligence
an
event
which
totally
changed
the
face
of
affairs
i
am
convinced
his
object
was
to
make
the
marshal
believe
that
he
looked
upon
that
event
as
less
important
than
it
really
was
however
this
object
was
not
attained
for
i
recollect
having
heard
macdonald
say
that
berthier
singular
postscript
and
the
tone
of
indifference
in
which
it
was
expressed
filled
him
with
mingled
surprise
and
alarm
marshal
macdonald
then
commanded
the
of
the
army
which
occupied
the
environs
of
montereau
six
hours
after
the
receipt
of
the
order
here
referred
to
macdonald
received
a
second
order
directing
him
to
put
his
troops
in
motion
and
he
learned
the
emperor
intention
of
marching
on
paris
with
all
his
remaining
force
on
receiving
the
emperor
second
order
macdonald
left
his
corps
at
montereau
and
repaired
in
haste
to
fontainebleau
when
he
arrived
there
the
emperor
had
already
intimated
to
the
generals
commanding
divisions
in
the
corps
assembled
at
fontainebleau
his
design
of
marching
on
paris
alarmed
at
this
determination
the
generals
most
of
whom
had
left
in
the
capital
their
wives
children
and
friends
requested
that
macdonald
would
go
with
them
to
wait
upon
napoleon
and
endeavour
to
dissuade
him
from
his
intention
gentlemen
said
the
marshal
in
the
present
situation
such
a
proceeding
may
displease
him
it
must
be
managed
cautiously
leave
it
to
me
gentlemen
i
will
go
to
the
chateau
marshal
macdonald
accordingly
went
to
the
palace
of
fontainebleau
where
the
following
conversation
ensued
between
him
and
the
emperor
and
i
beg
the
reader
to
bear
in
mind
that
it
was
related
to
me
by
the
marshal
himself
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
apartment
in
which
napoleon
was
the
latter
stepped
up
to
him
and
said
well
how
are
things
going
on
very
badly
how
badly
what
then
are
the
feelings
of
your
army
my
army
sire
is
entirely
discouraged
appalled
by
the
fate
of
paris
will
not
your
troops
join
me
in
an
advance
on
paris
sire
do
not
think
of
such
a
thing
if
i
were
to
give
such
an
order
to
my
troops
i
should
run
the
risk
of
being
disobeyed
but
what
is
to
be
done
i
can
not
remain
as
i
am
i
have
yet
resources
and
partisans
it
is
said
that
the
allies
will
no
longer
treat
with
me
well
no
matter
i
will
march
on
paris
i
will
be
revenged
on
the
inconstancy
of
the
parisians
and
the
baseness
of
the
senate
woe
to
the
members
of
the
government
they
have
patched
up
for
the
return
of
their
bourbons
that
is
what
they
are
looking
forward
to
but
i
shall
place
myself
at
the
head
of
my
guards
and
morrow
we
shall
be
in
the
tuileries
the
marshal
listened
in
silence
and
when
at
length
napoleon
became
somewhat
calm
he
observed
sire
it
appears
then
that
you
are
not
aware
of
what
has
taken
place
in
paris
of
the
establishment
of
a
provisional
government
and
i
know
it
all
and
what
then
sire
added
the
marshal
presenting
a
paper
to
napoleon
here
is
something
which
will
tell
you
more
than
i
can
macdonald
then
presented
to
him
a
letter
from
general
beurnonville
announcing
the
forfeiture
of
the
emperor
pronounced
by
the
senate
and
the
determination
of
the
allied
powers
not
to
treat
with
napoleon
or
any
member
of
his
family
marshal
said
the
emperor
before
he
opened
the
letter
may
this
be
read
aloud
certainly
sire
the
letter
was
then
handed
to
barre
who
read
it
an
individual
who
was
present
on
the
occasion
described
to
me
the
impression
which
the
reading
of
the
letter
produced
on
napoleon
his
countenance
exhibited
that
violent
contraction
of
the
features
which
i
have
often
remarked
when
his
mind
was
disturbed
however
he
did
not
lose
his
which
indeed
never
forsook
him
when
policy
or
vanity
required
that
he
should
retain
it
and
when
the
reading
of
beurnonville
letter
was
ended
he
affected
to
persist
in
his
intention
of
marching
on
paris
sire
exclaimed
macdonald
that
plan
must
be
renounced
not
a
sword
would
be
unsheathed
to
second
you
in
such
an
enterprise
after
this
conversation
between
the
emperor
and
macdonald
the
question
of
the
abdication
began
to
be
seriously
thought
of
caulaincourt
had
already
hinted
to
napoleon
that
in
case
of
his
abdicating
personally
there
was
a
possibility
of
inducing
the
allies
to
agree
to
a
council
of
regency
napoleon
then
determined
to
sign
the
act
of
abdication
which
he
himself
drew
up
in
the
following
terms
the
allied
powers
having
declared
that
the
emperor
napoleon
is
the
only
obstacle
to
the
of
peace
in
europe
the
emperor
napoleon
faithful
to
his
oath
declares
that
he
is
ready
to
descend
from
the
throne
to
leave
france
and
even
to
lay
down
his
life
for
the
welfare
of
the
country
which
is
inseparable
from
the
rights
of
his
son
those
of
the
regency
of
the
empress
and
the
maintenance
of
the
laws
of
the
empire
given
at
our
palace
of
fontainebleau
april
signed
napoleon
after
having
written
this
act
the
emperor
presented
it
to
the
marshals
saying
here
gentlemen
are
you
satisfied
this
abdication
of
napoleon
was
certainly
very
useless
but
in
case
of
anything
occurring
to
render
it
a
matter
of
importance
the
act
might
have
proved
entirely
illusory
its
meaning
might
appear
unequivocal
to
the
generality
of
people
but
not
to
me
who
was
so
well
initiated
in
the
cunning
to
which
napoleon
could
resort
when
it
suited
his
purpose
it
is
necessary
to
observe
that
napoleon
does
not
say
that
he
descends
from
the
throne
but
that
he
is
ready
to
descend
from
the
throne
this
was
a
subterfuge
by
the
aid
of
which
he
intended
to
open
new
negotiations
respecting
the
form
and
conditions
of
the
regency
of
his
son
in
case
of
the
allied
sovereigns
acceding
to
that
proposition
this
would
have
afforded
the
means
of
gaining
time
he
had
not
yet
resigned
all
hope
and
therefore
he
joyfully
received
a
piece
of
intelligence
communicated
to
him
by
general
allix
the
general
informed
the
emperor
that
he
had
met
an
austrian
officer
who
was
sent
by
francis
ii
to
prince
schwartzenberg
and
who
positively
assured
him
that
all
which
had
taken
place
in
paris
was
contrary
to
the
wish
of
the
emperor
of
austria
that
this
may
have
been
the
opinion
of
the
officer
is
possible
and
even
probable
but
it
is
certain
from
the
issue
of
a
mission
of
the
duc
de
cadore
champagny
of
which
i
shall
presently
speak
that
the
officer
expressed
merely
his
own
personal
opinion
however
as
soon
as
general
allix
had
communicated
this
good
news
as
he
termed
it
to
napoleon
the
latter
exclaimed
to
the
persons
who
were
about
him
i
told
you
so
gentlemen
francis
ii
can
not
carry
his
enmity
so
far
as
to
dethrone
his
daughter
vicenza
go
and
desire
the
marshals
to
return
my
act
of
abdication
i
will
send
a
courier
to
the
emperor
of
austria
thus
bonaparte
in
his
shipwreck
looked
round
for
a
saving
plank
and
tried
to
nurse
himself
in
illusions
the
duke
of
vicenza
went
to
marshals
ney
and
macdonald
whom
he
found
just
stepping
into
a
carriage
to
proceed
to
paris
both
positively
refused
to
return
the
act
to
caulaincourt
saying
we
are
sure
of
the
concurrence
of
the
emperor
of
austria
and
we
take
everything
upon
ourselves
the
result
proved
that
they
were
better
informed
than
general
allix
during
the
conversation
with
marshal
macdonald
which
has
just
been
described
the
emperor
was
seated
when
he
came
to
the
resolution
of
signing
the
abdication
he
arose
and
walked
once
or
twice
up
and
down
his
cabinet
after
he
had
written
and
signed
the
act
he
said
gentlemen
the
interests
of
my
son
the
interests
of
the
army
and
above
all
the
interests
of
france
must
be
defended
i
therefore
appoint
as
my
commissioners
to
the
allied
powers
the
duke
of
vicenza
the
prince
of
the
moskowa
and
the
duke
of
ragusa
are
you
satisfied
added
he
after
a
pause
i
think
these
interests
are
consigned
to
good
hands
all
present
answered
as
with
one
voice
yes
sire
but
no
sooner
was
this
answer
pronounced
than
the
emperor
threw
himself
upon
a
small
yellow
sofa
which
stood
near
the
window
and
striking
his
thigh
with
his
hand
with
a
sort
of
convulsive
motion
he
exclaimed
no
gentlemen
i
will
have
no
regency
with
my
guards
and
marmont
corps
i
shall
be
in
paris
ney
and
macdonald
vainly
endeavoured
to
undeceive
him
respecting
this
impracticable
design
he
rose
with
marked
and
rubbing
his
head
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
when
agitated
he
said
in
a
loud
and
authoritative
tone
retire
the
marshals
withdrew
and
napoleon
was
left
alone
with
caulaincourt
he
told
the
latter
that
what
had
most
displeased
him
in
the
proceedings
which
had
just
taken
place
was
the
reading
of
beurnonville
letter
sire
observed
the
duke
of
vicenza
it
was
by
your
order
that
the
letter
was
read
that
is
true
but
why
was
it
not
addressed
directly
to
me
by
macdonald
sire
the
letter
was
at
first
addressed
to
marshal
macdonald
but
the
aide
de
camp
who
was
the
bearer
of
it
had
orders
to
communicate
its
contents
to
marmont
on
passing
through
essonne
because
beurnonville
did
not
precisely
know
where
macdonald
would
be
found
after
this
brief
explanation
the
emperor
appeared
satisfied
and
he
said
to
caulaincourt
vicenza
call
back
macdonald
the
duke
of
vicenza
hastened
after
the
marshal
whom
he
found
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
of
the
palace
and
he
brought
him
back
to
the
emperor
when
macdonald
returned
to
the
cabinet
the
emperor
warmth
had
entirely
subsided
and
he
said
to
him
with
great
composure
well
duke
of
tarantum
do
you
think
that
the
regency
is
the
only
possible
thing
yes
sire
then
i
wish
you
to
go
with
ney
to
the
emperor
alexander
instead
of
marmont
it
is
better
that
he
should
remain
with
his
corps
to
which
his
presence
is
indispensable
you
will
therefore
go
with
ney
i
rely
on
you
i
hope
you
have
entirely
forgotten
all
that
has
separated
us
for
so
long
a
time
yes
sire
i
have
not
thought
of
it
since
i
am
glad
of
it
marshal
and
i
must
acknowledge
to
you
that
i
was
in
the
wrong
while
speaking
to
the
marshal
the
emperor
manifested
unusual
emotion
he
approached
him
and
pressed
his
hand
in
the
most
affectionate
way
the
emperor
three
commissioners
that
is
to
say
marshals
macdonald
and
ney
and
the
duke
of
vicenza
had
informed
marmont
that
they
would
dine
with
him
as
they
passed
through
essonne
and
would
acquaint
him
with
all
that
had
happened
at
fontainebleau
on
their
arrival
at
essonne
the
three
imperial
commissioners
explained
to
the
due
of
ragusa
the
object
of
their
mission
and
persuaded
him
to
accompany
them
to
the
emperor
alexander
this
obliged
the
marshal
to
inform
them
how
he
was
situated
the
negotiations
which
marmont
had
opened
and
almost
concluded
with
prince
schwartzenberg
were
rendered
void
by
the
mission
which
he
had
joined
and
which
it
was
necessary
he
should
himself
explain
to
the
commander
of
the
austrian
army
the
three
marshals
and
the
duke
of
vicenza
repaired
to
petit
bourg
the
headquarters
of
prince
schwartzenberg
and
there
the
prince
released
marmont
from
the
promise

had
given

the
business
of

proceeded
as
regularly
as
before
having
learned
that
a
great
many
intercepted
letters
had
been
thrown
aside
i
sent
on
the
of
april
an
advertisement
to
the
stating
that
the
letters
to
and
from
england
or
other
foreign
countries
which
had
been
lying
at
the
for
more
than
three
years
would
be
forwarded
to
their
respective
addresses
this
produced
to
the
a
receipt
of
nearly
francs
a
fact
which
may
afford
an
idea
of
the
enormous
number
of
intercepted
letters
on
the
night
after
the
publication
of
the
advertisement
i
was
awakened
by
an
express
from
the
provisional
government
by
which
i
was
requested
to
proceed
with
all
possible
haste
to
de
talleyrand
hotel
i
rose
and
i
set
off
immediately
and
i
got
there
some
minutes
before
the
arrival
of
the
emperor
commissioners
i
went
up
to
the
salon
on
the
first
floor
which
was
one
of
the
suite
of
apartments
occupied
by
the
emperor
alexander
the
marshals
retired
to
confer
with
the
monarch
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
anxiety
or
i
may
rather
say
consternation
which
during
their
absence
prevailed
among
some
of
the
members
of
the
provisional
government
and
other
persons
assembled
in
the
salon
where
i
was
while
the
marshals
were
with
alexander
i
learned
that
they
had
previously
conversed
with
de
talleyrand
who
observed
to
them
if
you
succeed
in
your
designs
you
will
compromise
all
who
have
met
in
this
hotel
since
the
of
april
and
the
number
is
not
small
for
my
part
take
no
account
of
me
i
am
willing
to
be
compromised
i
had
passed
the
evening
of
this
day
with
de
talleyrand
who
then
observed
to
the
emperor
alexander
in
my
presence
will
you
support
bonaparte
no
you
neither
can
nor
will
i
have
already
had
the
honour
to
tell
your
majesty
that
we
can
have
no
choice
but
between
bonaparte
and
louis
xviii
anything
else
would
be
an
intrigue
and
no
intrigue
can
have
power
to
support
him
who
may
be
its
object
bernadotte
eugene
the
regency
all
those
propositions
result
from
intrigues
in
present
circumstances
nothing
but
a
new
principle
is
sufficiently
strong
to
establish
the
new
order
of
things
which
must
be
adopted
louis
xviii
is
a
principle
none
of
the
members
of
the
provisional
government
were
present
at
this
conference
for
no
one
was
willing
to
appear
to
influence
in
any
way
the
determination
of
the
chief
of
the
coalition
upon
the
subject
of
this
important
mission
general
dessolles
alone
in
quality
of
commander
of
the
national
guard
of
paris
was
requested
to
be
present
at
length
the
marshals
entered
the
salon
where
we
were
and
their
appearance
created
a
sensation
which
it
is
impossible
to
describe
but
the
expression
of
dissatisfaction
which
we
thought
we
remarked
in
their
countenances
restored
the
hopes
of
those
who
for
some
hours
had
been
a
prey
to
apprehensions
macdonald
with
his
head
elevated
and
evidently
under
the
influence
of
strong
irritation
approached
beurnonville
and
thus
addressed
him
in
answer
to
a
question
which
the
latter
had
put
to
him
speak
not
to
me
sir
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
you
have
made
me
forget
a
friendship
of
thirty
years
then
turning
to
dupont
as
for
you
sir
he
continued
in
the
same
tone
your
conduct
towards
the
emperor
is
not
generous
i
confess
that
he
has
treated
you
with
severity
perhaps
he
may
even
have
been
unjust
to
you
with
respect
to
the
affair
of
baylen
but
how
long
has
it
been
the
practice
to
avenge
a
personal
wrong
at
the
expense
of
one
country
these
remarks
were
made
with
such
warmth
and
in
so
elevated
a
tone
of
voice
that
caulaincourt
thought
it
necessary
to
interfere
and
said
do
not
forget
gentlemen
that
this
is
the
residence
of
the
emperor
of
russia
at
this
moment
de
talleyrand
returned
from
the
interview
with
the
emperor
which
he
had
had
after
the
departure
of
the
marshals
and
approaching
the
group
formed
round
macdonald
gentlemen
said
he
if
you
wish
to
dispute
and
discuss
step
down
to
my
apartments
that
would
be
useless
replied
macdonald
my
comrades
and
i
do
not
acknowledge
the
provisional
government
the
three
marshals
ney
macdonald
and
marmont
then
immediately
retired
with
caulaincourt
and
went
to
ney
hotel
there
to
await
the
answer
which
the
emperor
alexander
had
promised
to
give
them
after
consulting
the
king
of
prussia
such
was
this
which
possessed
more
dramatic
effect
than
many
which
are
performed
on
the
stage
in
it
all
was
real
on
its
denouement
depended
the
political
state
of
france
and
the
existence
of
all
those
who
had
already
declared
themselves
in
favour
of
the
bourbons
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
and
one
which
affords
a
striking
lesson
to
men
who
are
tempted
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
any
political
cause
that
most
of
those
who
then
demanded
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
have
successively
fallen
into
disgrace
when
the
marshals
and
caulaincourt
had
retired
we
were
all
anxious
to
know
what
had
passed
between
them
and
the
emperor
of
russia
i
learned
from
dessolles
who
as
i
have
stated
was
present
at
the
conference
in
his
rank
of
commander
of
the
national
guard
of
paris
that
the
marshals
were
unanimous
in
urging
alexander
to
accede
to
a
regency
macdonald
especially
supported
that
proposition
with
much
warmth
and
among
the
observations
he
made
i
recollect
dessolles
mentioned
the
following
i
am
not
authorised
to
treat
in
any
way
for
the
fate
reserved
for
the
emperor
we
have
full
powers
to
treat
for
the
regency
the
army
and
france
but
the
emperor
has
positively
forbidden
us
to
specify
anything
personally
regarding
himself
alexander
merely
replied
that
does
not
astonish
me
the
marshals
then
resuming
the
conversation
dwelt
much
on
the
respect
which
was
due
to
the
military
glory
of
france
they
strongly
manifested
their
disinclination
to
abandon
the
family
of
a
man
who
had
so
often
led
them
to
victory
and
lastly
they
reminded
the
emperor
alexander
of
his
own
declaration
in
which
he
proclaimed
in
his
own
name
as
well
as
on
the
part
of
his
allies
that
it
was
not
their
intention
to
impose
on
france
any
government
whatever
dessolles
who
had
all
along
declared
himself
in
favour
of
the
bourbons
in
his
turn
entered
into
the
discussion
with
as
much
warmth
as
the
partisans
of
the
regency
he
represented
to
alexander
how
many
persons
would
be
compromised
for
merely
having
acted
or
declared
their
opinions
behind
the
shield
of
his
promises
he
repeated
what
alexander
had
already
been
told
that
the
regency
would
in
fact
be
nothing
but
bonaparte
in
disguise
however
dessolles
acknowledged
that
such
was
the
effect
of
marshal
macdonald
powerful
and
persuasive
eloquence
that
alexander
seemed
to
waver
and
unwilling
to
give
the
marshals
a
positive
refusal
he
had
recourse
to
a
subterfuge
by
which
he
would
be
enabled
to
execute
the
design
he
had
irrevocably
formed
without
seeming
to
take
on
himself
alone
the
responsibility
of
a
change
of
government
dessolles
accordingly
informed
us
that
alexander
at
last
gave
the
following
answer
to
the
marshals
gentlemen
i
am
not
alone
in
an
affair
of
such
importance
i
must
consult
the
king
of
prussia
for
i
have
promised
to
do
nothing
without
consulting
him
in
a
few
hours
you
shall
know
my
decision
it
was
this
decision
which
the
marshals
went
to
wait
for
at
ney
most
of
the
members
of
the
provisional
government
attributed
the
evasive
reply
of
the
emperor
alexander
to
the
influence
of
the
speech
of
dessolles
for
my
part
while
i
do
justice
to
the
manner
in
which
he
declared
himself
on
this
important
occasion
i
do
not
ascribe
to
his
eloquence
the
power
of
fixing
alexander
resolution
for
i
well
know
by
experience
how
easy
it
is
to
make
princes
appear
to
adopt
the
advice
of
any
one
when
the
counsel
given
is
precisely
that
which
they
wish
to
follow
from
the
sentiments
of
alexander
at
this
time
i
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
as
to
the
course
he
would
finally
pursue
and
i
considered
what
he
said
about
consulting
the
king
of
prussia
to
be
merely
a
polite
excuse
by
which
he
avoided
the
disagreeable
task
of
giving
the
marshals
a
direct
refusal
i
therefore
returned
home
quite
satisfied
as
to
the
result
of
the
emperor
alexander
visit
to
the
king
of
prussia
i
knew
from
the
persons
about
the
czar
that
he
cherished
a
hatred
which
was
but
too
well
justified
towards
bonaparte
frederick
william
is
of
too
firm
a
character
to
have
yielded
to
any
of
the
considerations
which
might
on
this
subject
have
been
pressed
on
him
as
they
had
been
on
the
emperor
of
russia
but
besides
that
the
king
of
prussia
had
legitimate
reasons
for
disliking
napoleon
policy
would
at
that
time
have
required
that
he
should
appear
to
be
his
enemy
for
to
do
so
was
to
render
himself
popular
with
his
subjects
but
the
king
of
prussia
did
not
need
to
act
under
the
dictates
of
policy
he
followed
his
own
opinion
in
rejecting
the
propositions
of
the
marshals
which
he
did
without
hesitation
and
with
much
energy
while
the
marshals
had
gone
to
paris
bonaparte
was
anxious
to
ascertain
whether
his
commissioners
had
passed
the
advanced
posts
of
the
foreign
armies
and
in
case
of
resistance
he
determined
to
march
on
paris
for
he
could
not
believe
that
he
had
lost
every
chance
he
sent
an
aide
de
camp
to
desire
marmont
to
come
immediately
to
fontainebleau
such
was
napoleon
impatience
that
instead
of
waiting
for
the
return
of
his
aide
de
camp
he
sent
off
a
second
and
then
a
third
officer
on
the
same
errand
this
rapid
succession
of
envoys
from
the
emperor
alarmed
the
general
who
commanded
the
different
divisions
of
marmont
corps
at
essonne
they
feared
that
the
emperor
was
aware
of
the
convention
concluded
that
morning
with
prince
schwartzenberg
and
that
he
had
sent
for
marmont
with
the
view
of
reprimanding
him
the
fact
was
napoleon
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
for
marmont
on
departing
for
paris
with
macdonald
and
ney
had
left
orders
that
it
should
be
said
that
he
had
gone
to
inspect
his
lines
souham
lebrun
des
essarts
and
bordessoulle
who
had
given
their
assent
to
the
convention
with
prince
schwartzenberg
deliberated
in
the
absence
of
marmont
and
perhaps
being
ignorant
that
he
was
released
from
his
promise
and
fearing
the
vengeance
of
napoleon
they
determined
to
march
upon
versailles
on
arriving
there
the
troops
not
finding
the
marshal
at
their
head
thought
themselves
betrayed
and
a
spirit
of
insurrection
broke
out
among
them
one
of
marmont
aides
de
camp
whom
he
had
left
at
essonne
exerted
every
endeavour
to
prevent
the
departure
of
his
general
corps
but
finding
all
his
efforts
unavailing
he
hastened
to
paris
to
inform
the
marshal
of
what
had
happened
marmont
received
this
news
he
was
breakfasting
at
ney
with
macdonald
and
caulaincourt
they
were
waiting
for
the
answer
which
the
emperor
alexander
had
promised
to
send
them
the
march
of
his
corps
on
versailles
threw
marmont
into
despair
he
said
to
the
marshals
i
must
be
off
to
join
my
corps
and
quell
this
mutiny
and
without
losing
a
moment
he
ordered
his
carriage
and
directed
the
coachman
to
drive
with
the
utmost
speed
he
sent
forward
one
of
his
aides
de
camp
to
inform
the
troops
of
his
approach
having
arrived
within
a
hundred
paces
of
the
place
where
his
troops
were
assembled
he
found
the
generals
who
were
under
his
orders
advancing
to
meet
him
they
urged
him
not
to
go
farther
as
the
men
were
in
open
insurrection
i
will
go
into
the
midst
of
them
said
marmont
in
a
moment
they
shall
either
kill
me
or
acknowledge
me
as
their
chief
he
sent
off
another
aide
de
camp
to
range
the
troops
in
the
order
of
battle
then
alighting
from
the
carriage
and
mounting
a
horse
he
advanced
alone
and
thus
harangued
his
troops
how
is
there
treason
here
is
it
possible
that
you
disown
me
am
i
not
your
comrade
have
i
not
been
wounded
twenty
times
among
you
have
i
not
shared
your
fatigues
and
privations
and
am
i
not
ready
to
do
so
again
here
marmont
was
interrupted
by
a
general
shout
of
vive
le
marechal
vive
le
marechal
the
alarm
caused
among
the
members
of
the
provisional
government
by
the
mission
of
the
marshals
was
increased
by
the
news
of
the
mutiny
of
marmont
troops
during
the
whole
of
the
day
we
were
in
a
state
of
tormenting
anxiety
it
was
feared
that
the
insurrectionary
spirit
might
spread
among
other
corps
of
the
army
and
the
cause
of
france
again
be
endangered
but
the
courage
of
marmont
saved
everything
it
would
be
impossible
to
convey
any
idea
of
the
manner
in
which
he
was
received
by
us
at
talleyrand
when
he
related
the
particulars
of
what
had
occurred
at
versailles
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
marmont
had
acted
so
nobly
it
was
proposed
that
the
army
should
adopt
the
white
cockade
in
reply
to
this
proposition
the
marshal
said
gentlemen
i
have
made
my
troops
understand
the
necessity
of
serving
france
before
all
things
they
have
consequently
returned
to
order
and
i
can
now
answer
for
them
but
what
i
can
not
answer
for
is
to
induce
them
to
abandon
the
colours
which
have
led
them
to
victory
for
the
last
twenty
years
therefore
do
not
count
upon
me
for
a
thing
which
i
consider
to
be
totally
hostile
to
the
interests
of
france
i
will
speak
to
the
emperor
alexander
on
the
subject
such
were
marmont
words
every
one
appeared
to
concur
in
his
opinion
and
the
discussion
terminated
for
my
own
part
i
find
by
my
notes
that
i
declared
myself
strongly
in
favour
of
proposition
the
marshal
opinion
having
been
adopted
at
least
provisionally
an
article
was
prepared
for
the
moniteur
in
nearly
the
following
terms
the
white
cockade
has
been
during
the
last
four
days
a
badge
for
the
manifestation
of
public
opinion
in
favour
of
the
overthrow
of
an
oppressive
government
it
has
been
the
only
means
of
distinguishing
the
partisans
of
the
restoration
of
the
old
dynasty
to
which
at
length
we
are
to
be
indebted
for
repose
but
as
the
late
government
is
at
an
end
all
colours
differing
from
our
national
colours
are
useless
let
us
therefore
resume
those
which
have
so
often
led
us
to
victory
such
was
the
spirit
of
the
article
though
possibly
the
above
copy
may
differ
in
a
few
words
it
met
with
the
unqualified
approbation
of
every
one
present
i
was
therefore
extremely
surprised
on
looking
at
the
next
day
to
find
that
the
article
was
not
inserted
i
knew
not
what
courtly
interference
prevented
the
appearance
of
the
article
but
i
remember
that
marmont
was
very
ill
pleased
at
its
omission
he
complained
on
the
subject
to
the
emperor
alexander
who
promised
to
write
and
in
fact
did
write
to
the
provisional
government
to
get
the
article
inserted
however
it
did
not
appear
and
in
a
few
days
we
obtained
a
solution
of
the
enigma
as
we
might
perhaps
have
done
before
if
we
had
tried
the
emperor
alexander
also
promised
to
write
to
the
comte
and
to
inform
him
that
the
opinion
of
france
was
in
favour
of
the
preservation
of
the
three
colours
but
i
do
not
know
whether
the
letter
was
written
or
if
it
was
what
answer
it
received
marshal
jourdan
who
was
then
at
rouen
received
a
letter
written
without
the
knowledge
of
marmont
informing
him
that
the
latter
had
mounted
the
white
cockade
in
his
corps
jourdan
thought
he
could
not
do
otherwise
than
follow
marmont
example
and
he
announced
to
the
provisional
government
that
in
consequence
of
the
resolution
of
the
duke
of
ragusa
he
had
just
ordered
his
corps
to
wear
the
white
cockade
marmont
could
now
be
boldly
faced
and
when
he
complained
to
the
provisional
government
of
the
of
the
article
in
the
moniteur
the
reply
was
it
can
not
now
appear
you
see
marshal
jourdan
has
mounted
the
white
cockade
you
would
not
give
the
army
two
sets
of
colours
marmont
could
make
no
answer
to
so
positive
a
fact
it
was
not
till
some
time
after
that
i
learned
jourdan
had
determined
to
unfurl
the
white
flag
only
on
the
positive
assurance
that
marmont
had
already
done
so
thus
we
lost
the
colours
which
had
been
worn
by
louis
which
louis
when
a
prince
had
adopted
and
in
which
the
comte
showed
himself
on
his
return
to
the
parisians
for
he
entered
the
capital
in
the
uniform
of
the
national
guard
the
fraud
played
off
by
some
members
of
the
provisional
government
was
attended
by
fatal
consequences
many
evils
might
have
been
spared
to
france
had
marmont
advice
been
adopted
at
the
period
of
the
dissolution
of
the
empire
there
might
be
said
to
be
three
governments
in
france
viz
the
provisional
government
in
paris
napoleon
at
fontainebleau
and
the
doubtful
and
ambulatory
regency
of
maria
louisa
doubtful
and
ambulatory
the
regency
might
well
be
called
for
there
was
so
little
decision
as
to
the
course
to
be
adopted
by
the
empress
that
it
was
at
first
proposed
to
conduct
her
to
orleans
then
to
tours
and
she
went
finally
to
blois
the
uncertainty
which
prevailed
respecting
the
destiny
of
maria
louisa
is
proved
by
a
document
which
i
have
in
my
possession
and
of
which
there
can
not
be
many
copies
in
existence
it
is
a
circular
addressed
to
the
prefects
by
de
montalivet
the
minister
of
the
interior
who
accompanied
the
empress
in
it
a
blank
is
left
for
the
seat
of
the
government
to
which
the
prefects
are
desired
to
send
their
communications
in
the
copy
i
possess
the
blank
is
filled
up
with
the
word
blois
in
manuscript
as
soon
as
maria
louisa
was
made
acquainted
with
the
events
that
had
taken
place
around
paris
she
sent
for
the
duc
de
cadore
and
gave
him
a
letter
addressed
to
the
emperor
of
austria
saying
take
this
to
my
father
who
must
be
at
dijon
i
rely
on
you
for
defending
the
interests
of
france
those
of
the
emperor
and
above
all
those
of
my
son
certainly
maria

confidence
could
not
be
better
placed
and
those
great
interests
would
have
been
defended
by
the
duc
de
cadore
defendi
possent
after
the
departure
of
the
due
de

maria

published
the
following
proclamation
addressed
to
the
french
people
by
the
empress
regent
a
proclamation
the
events
of
the
war
have
placed
the
capital
in
the
power
of
foreigners
the

has
marched
to
defend
it
at
the
head
of
his
armies
so
often
victorious
they
are
face
to
face
with
the

before
the

from

i
have
chosen

from

in

my

are
under

by

april
it
is
to
be
inferred
that
the

had
within
three
days
adopted
the
resolution
of
not
quitting
blois
for
the
above
document
presents
no
blanks
nor

filled
up
in
writing
the
empress
proclamation
though
a
powerful
appeal
to
the
feelings
of
the
french
people
produced
no
effect
maria
louisa
proclamation
was
dated
the
of
april
on
the
evening
of
which
day
napoleon
signed
the
conditional
abdication
with
the
fate
of
which
the
reader
has
already
been
made
acquainted
de
montalivet
transmitted
the
empress
proclamation
accompanied
by
another
circular
to
the
prefects
of
whom
very
few
received
it
de
champagny
having
left
blois
with
the
letter
he
had
received
from
the
empress
proceeded
to
the
headquarters
of
the
emperor
of
austria
carefully
avoiding
those
roads
which
were
occupied
by
cossack
troops
he
arrived
not
without
considerable
difficulty
at
chanseaux
where
frances
ii
was
expected
when
the
emperor
arrived
the
duc
de
cadore
was
announced
and
immediately
introduced
to
his
majesty
the
duke
remained
some
hours
with
francis
without
being
able
to
obtain
from
him
anything
but
fair
protestations
the
emperor
always
took
refuge
behind
the
promise
he
had
given
to
his
allies
to
approve
whatever
measures
they
might
adopt
the
duke
was
not
to
leave
the
headquarters
that
evening
and
in
the
hope
that
his
majesty
might
yet
reflect
on
the
critical
situation
of
his
daughter
he
asked
permission
to
take
leave
next
morning
he
accordingly
presented
himself
to
the
emperor
levee
when
he
renewed
his
efforts
in
support
of
the
claims
of
maria
louisa
i
have
a
great
affection
for
my
daughter
and
also
for
my
law
said
the
emperor
i
bear
them
both
in
my
heart
and
would
shed
my
blood
for
them
ah
sire
exclaimed
de
champagny
such
a
sacrifice
is
not
necessary
yes
duke
i
say
again
i
would
shed
my
blood
i
would
resign
my
life
for
them
but
i
have
given
my
allies
a
promise
not
to
treat
without
them
and
to
approve
all
that
they
may
do
besides
added
the
emperor
my
minister
de
metternich
has
gone
to
their
headquarters
and
i
will
ratify
whatever
he
may
sign
when
the
duc
de
cadore
related
to
me
the
particulars
of
his
mission
in
which
zeal
could
not
work
an
impossibility
i
remarked
that
he
regarded
as
a
circumstance
fatal
to
napoleon
the
absence
of
de
metternich
and
the
presence
of
stadion
at
the
headquarters
of
the
emperor
of
austria
though
in
all
probability
nothing
could
have
arrested
the
course
of
events
yet
it
is
certain
that
the
personal
sentiments
of
the
two
austrian
ministers
towards
napoleon
were
widely
different
i
am
not
going
too
far
when
i
affirm
that
policy
apart
de
metternich
was
much
attached
to
napoleon
in
support
of
this
assertion
i
may
quote
a
fact
of
which
i
can
guarantee
the
authenticity
when
de
metternich
was
complimented
on
the
occasion
of
maria
marriage
he
replied
to
have
contributed
to
a
measure
which
has
received
the
approbation
of
men
is
indeed
a
just
subject
of
congratulation
such
a
remark
openly
made
by
the
intelligent
minister
of
the
cabinet
of
vienna
was
well
calculated
to
gratify
the
ears
of
napoleon
from
whom
however
de
metternich
in
his
personal
relations
did
not
conceal
the
truth
i
recollect
a
reply
which
was
made
by
de
metternich
at
dresden
after
a
little
hesitation
as
to
you
said
the
emperor
you
will
not
go
to
war
with
me
it
is
impossible
that
you
can
declare
yourself
against
me
that
can
never
be
sire
we
are
not
now
quite
allies
and
some
time
hence
we
may
become
enemies
this
hint
was
the
last
which
napoleon
received
from
metternich
and
napoleon
must
have
been
blind
indeed
not
to
have
profited
by
it
as
to
stadion
he
entertained
a
profound
dislike
of
the
emperor
that
minister
knew
and
could
not
forget
that
his
preceding
exclusion
from
the
cabinet
of
vienna
had
been
due
to
the
influence
of
napoleon
whether
or
not
the
absence
of
metternich
influenced
the
resolution
of
francis
it
is
certain
that
that
monarch
yielded
nothing
to
the
urgent
solicitations
of
a
minister
who
conscientiously
fulfilled
the
delicate
mission
consigned
to
him
de
champagny
rejoined
the
empress
at
orleans
whither
she
had
repaired
on
leaving
blois
he
found
maria
louisa
almost
deserted
all
the
grand
dignitaries
of
the
empire
having
successively
returned
to
paris
after
sending
in
their
submissions
to
the
provisional
government
i
had
scarcely
entered
upon
the
exercise
of
my
functions
as
general
when
on
the
morning
of
the
of
april
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
prussian
general
officer
enter
my
cabinet
i
immediately
recognised
him
as
general
blucher
he
had
commanded
the
prussian
army
in
the
battle
which
took
place
at
the
gates
of
paris
sir
said
he
i
consider
it
one
of
my
first
duties
on
entering
paris
to
thank
you
for
the
attention
i
received
from
you
in
hamburg
i
am
sorry
that
i
was
not
sooner
aware
of
your
being
in
pains
i
assure
you
that
had
i
been
sooner
informed
of
this
circumstance
the
capitulation
should
have
been
made
without
a
blow
being
struck
how
much
blood
might
then
have
been
spared
general
said
i
on
what
do
you
ground
this
assurance
if
i
had
known
that
you
were
in
paris
i
would
have
given
you
a
letter
to
the
king
of
prussia
that
monarch
who
knows
the
resources
and
intentions
of
the
allies
would
i
am
sure
have
authorised
you
to
decide
a
suspension
of
arms
before
the
neighbourhood
of
paris
became
the
theatre
of
the
war
but
resumed
i
in
spite
of
the
good
intentions
of
the
allies
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
to
prevent
resistance
french
pride
irritated
as
it
was
by
reverses
would
have
opposed
insurmountable
obstacles
to
such
a
measure
but
good
heavens
you
would
have
seen
that
resistance
could
be
of
no
avail
against
such
immense
masses
you
are
right
general
but
french
honour
would
have
been
defended
to
the
last
i
am
fully
aware
of
that
but
surely
you
have
earned
glory
enough
yet
our
french
susceptibility
would
have
made
us
look
upon
that
glory
as
tarnished
if
paris
had
been
occupied
without
defence
but
under
present
circumstances
i
am
well
pleased
that
you
were
satisfied
with
my
conduct
in
hamburg
for
it
induces
me
to
hope
that
you
will
observe
the
same
moderation
in
paris
that
i
exercised
there
the
days
are
past
when
it
could
be
said
woe
to
the
conquered
you
are
right
yet
added
he
smiling
you
know
we
are
called
the
northern
barbarians
then
general
returned
i
you
have
a
fair
opportunity
of
showing
that
that
designation
is
a
libel
some
days
after
blucher
visit
i
had
the
honour
of
being
admitted
to
a
private
audience
of
the
king
of
prussia
clarke
and
berthier
were
also
received
in
this
audience
which
took
place
at
the
hotel
of
prince
eugene
where
the
king
of
prussia
resided
in
paris
we
waited
for
some
minutes
in
the
salon
and
when
frederick
william
entered
from
his
cabinet
i
remarked
on
his
countenance
an
air
of
embarrassment
and
austerity
which
convinced
me
that
he
had
been
studying
his
part
as
great
personages
are
in
the
habit
of
doing
on
similar
occasions
the
king
on
entering
the
salon
first
noticed
berthier
whom
he
addressed
with
much
kindness
bestowing
praises
on
the
french
troops
and
complimenting
the
marshal
on
his
conduct
during
the
war
in
germany
berthier
returned
thanks
for
these
praises
for
though
he
was
not
remarkable
for
strength
of
understanding
or
energy
of
mind
yet
he
was
not
a
bad
man
and
i
have
known
many
proofs
of
his
good
conduct
in
conquered
countries
after
saluting
berthier
the
king
of
prussia
turned
towards
clarke
and
his
countenance
immediately
assumed
an
expression
of
dissatisfaction
he
had
evidently
not
forgotten
clarke
conduct
in
berlin
he
reminded
him
that
he
had
rendered
the
continental
system
more
odious
than
it
was
in
itself
and
that
he
had
shown
no
moderation
in
the
execution
of
his
orders
in
short
said
his
majesty
if
i
have
any
advice
to
give
you
it
is
that
you
never
again
return
to
prussia
the
king
pronounced
these
words
in
so
loud
and
decided
a
tone
that
clarke
was
perfectly
confounded
he
uttered
some
unintelligible
observations
which
however
frederick
william
did
not
notice
for
suddenly
turning
towards
me
he
said
with
an
air
of
affability
ah
de
bourrienne
i
am
glad
to
see
you
and
i
take
this
opportunity
of
repeating
what
i
wrote
to
you
from
gonigsberg
you
always
extended
protection
to
the
germans
and
did
all
you
could
to
alleviate
their
condition
i
learned
with
great
satisfaction
what
you
did
for
the
prussians
whom
the
fate
of
war
drove
into
hamburg
and
i
feel
pleasure
in
telling
you
in
the
presence
of
these
two
gentlemen
that
if
all
the
french
agents
had
acted
as
you
did
we
should
not
probably
be
here
i
expressed
by
a
profound
bow
how
much
i
was
gratified
by
this
complimentary
address
and
the
king
after
saluting
us
retired
about
the
middle
of
april
bernadotte
arrived
in
paris
his
situation
had
become
equivocal
since
circumstances
had
banished
the
hopes
he
might
have
conceived
in
his
interview
with
the
emperor
alexander
at
abo
besides
he
had
been
represented
in
some
official
pamphlets
as
a
traitor
to
france
and
among
certain
worshippers
of
our
injured
glory
there
prevailed
a
feeling
of
irritation
and
which
was
unjustly
directed
towards
bernadotte
i
even
remember
that
napoleon
before
he
had
fallen
from
his
power
had
a
sort
of
national
protest
made
by
the
police
against
the
prince
royal
of
sweden
this
prince
had
reserved
an
hotel
in
the
rue
and
the
words
down
with
the
traitor
down
with
the
perjurer
were
shouted
there
but
this
had
no
result
as
it
was
only
considered
an
outrage
caused
by
a
spirit
of
petty
vengeance
while
bernadotte
was
in
paris
i
saw
him
every
day
he
but
faintly
disguised
from
me
the
hope
he
had
entertained
of
ruling
france
and
in
the
numerous
conversations
to
which
our
respective
occupations
led
i
ascertained
though
bernadotte
did
not
formally
tell
me
so
that
he
once
had
strong
expectations
of
succeeding
napoleon
pressed
at
last
into
his
final
intrenchments
he
broke
through
all
reserve
and
confirmed
all
i
knew
of
the
interview
of
abo
i
asked
bernadotte
what
he
thought
of
the
projects
which
were
attributed
to
moreau
whether
it
was
true
that
he
had
in
him
a
competitor
and
whether
moreau
had
aspired
to
the
dangerous
honour
of
governing
france
those
reports
replied
the
prince
royal
of
sweden
are
devoid
of
foundation
at
least
i
can
assure
you
that
in
the
conversations
i
have
had
with
the
emperor
alexander
that
sovereign
never
said
anything
which
could
warrant
such
a
supposition
i
know
that
the
emperor
of
russia
wished
to
avail
himself
of
the
military
talents
of
moreau
in
the
great
struggle
that
had
commenced
and
to
enable
the
exiled
general
to
return
to
his
country
in
the
hope
that
should
the
war
prove
fortunate
he
would
enjoy
the
honours
and
privileges
due
to
his
past
services
bernadotte
expressed
to
me
astonishment
at
the
recall
of
the
bourbons
and
assured
me
that
he
had
not
expected
the
french
people
would
so
readily
have
consented
to
the
restoration
i
confess
i
was
surprised
that
bernadotte
with
the
intelligence
i
knew
him
to
possess
should
imagine
that
the
will
of
subjects
has
any
influence
in
changes
of
government
during
his
stay
in
paris
bernadotte
evinced
for
me
the
same
sentiments
of
friendship
which
he
had
shown
me
at
hamburg
one
day
i
received
from
him
a
letter
dated
paris
with
which
he
transmitted
to
me
one
of
the
crosses
of
the
polar
star
which
the
king
of
sweden
had
left
at
his
disposal
bernadotte
was
not
very
well
satisfied
with
his
residence
in
paris
in
spite
of
the
friendship
which
the
emperor
alexander
constantly
manifested
towards
him
after
a
few
days
he
set
out
for
sweden
having
first
taken
leave
of
the
comte
i
did
not
see
him
after
his
farewell
visit
to
the
count
so
that
i
know
not
what
was
the
nature
of
the
conversation
which
passed
between
the
two
princes

treaties
of

no

when
the
truth
was
not
satisfactory
