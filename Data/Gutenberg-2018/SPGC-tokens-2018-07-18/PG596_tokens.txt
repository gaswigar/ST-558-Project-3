is

let

but
what
if
i
heard
my
first
love
calling
me
again
hold
me
on
your
heart
as
the
brave
sea
holds
the
foam
take
me
far
away

the
hills
that
hide
your
home
peace
shall
thatch

and
love
shall
latch

but
what
if
i
heard
my
first
love
calling
me
once
more
new
love
and
old
in
my
heart
the
old
love
struggled
with
the
new
it
was
ghostly
waking
all
night
thru
dear
things
kind
things
that
my
old
love
said
ranged
themselves
reproachfully
round
my
bed
but
i
could
not
heed
them
for
i
seemed
to
see
the
eyes
of
my
new
love
fixed
on
me
old
love
old
love
how
can
i
be
true
shall
i
be
faithless

to
you

colin
only
looked
at

and
never
kissed

strephon
kiss
was
lost

robin
lost

play
but
the
kiss
in
colin
eyes
haunts
me
night
and
day
spring
in
central
park
the
lovers
sit
on
every
hilly
path
they
stroll
each
thinks
his
love
is
infinite
and
crowns
his
soul
but
we
are
cynical
and
wise
we
walk
a
careful
foot
apart
you
make
a
little
joke
that
tries
to
hide
your
heart
give
over
we
have
laughed
enough
oh
dearest
and
most
foolish
friend
why
do
you
wage
a
war
with
love
to
lose
your
battle
in
the
end
the
lighted
window
he
said
in
the
winter
dusk
when
the
pavements
were
gleaming
with
rain
i
walked
thru
a
dingy
street
hurried
harassed
thinking
of
all
my
problems
that
never
are
solved
suddenly
out
of
the
mist
a
flaring
shone
from
a
huddled
shop
i
saw
thru
the
bleary
window
a
mass
of
playthings
hung
on
strings
valentines
paper
and
tinsel
tops
of
scarlet
and
green
candy
marbles
jacks
a
confusion
of
color
pathetically
gaudy
and
cheap
all
of
my
boyhood
rushed
back
once
more
these
things
were
treasures
wildly
desired
with
covetous
eyes
i
looked
again
at
the
marbles
the
precious
agates
the
the
chinies
then
i
passed
on
in
the
winter
dusk
the
pavements
were
gleaming
with
rain
there
in
the
lighted
window
i
left
my
boyhood
the
kiss
before
you
kissed
me
only
winds
of
heaven
had
kissed
me
and
the
tenderness
of
rain
now
you
have
come
how
can
i
care
for
kisses
like
theirs
again
i
sought
the
sea
she
sent
her
winds
to
meet
me
they
surged
about
me
singing
of
the
south
i
turned
my
head
away
to
keep
still
holy
your
kiss
upon
my
mouth
and
swift
sweet
rains
of
shining
april
weather
found
not
my
lips
where
living
kisses
are
i
bowed
my
head
lest
they
put
out
my
glory
as
rain
puts
out
a
star
i
am
my
love
and
he
is
mine
forever
sealed
with
a
seal
and
safe
forevermore
think
you
that
i
could
let
a
beggar
enter
where
a
king
stood
before
swans
night
is
over
the
park
and
a
few
brave
stars
look
on
the
lights
that
link
it
with
chains
of
gold
the
lake
bears
up
their
reflection
in
broken
bars
that
seem
too
heavy
for
tremulous
water
to
hold
we
watch
the
swans
that
sleep
in
a
shadowy
place
and
now
and
again
one
wakes
and
uplifts
its
head
how
still
you
are
your
gaze
is
on
my
face
we
watch
the
swans
and
never
a
word
is
said
the
old
maid
i
saw
her
in
a
broadway
car
the
woman
i
might
grow
to
be
i
felt
my
lover
look
at
her
and
then
turn
suddenly
to
me
her
hair
was
dull
and
drew
no
light
and
yet
its
color
was
as
mine
her
eyes
were
strangely
like
my
eyes
tho
love
had
never
made
them
shine
her
body
was
a
thing
grown
thin
hungry
for
love
that
never
came
her
soul
was
frozen
in
the
dark
unwarmed
forever
by
love
flame
i
felt
my
lover
look
at
her
and
then
turn
suddenly
to
me
his
eyes
were
magic
to
defy
the
woman
i
shall
never
be
from
the
woolworth
tower
vivid
with
love
eager
for
greater
beauty
out
of
the
night
we
come
into
the
corridor
brilliant
and
warm
a
metal
door
slides
open
and
the
lift
receives
us
swiftly
with
sharp
unswerving
flight
the
car
shoots
upward
and
the
air
swirling
and
angry
howls
like
a
hundred
devils
past
the
maze
of
trim
bronze
doors
steadily
we
ascend
i
cling
to
you
conscious
of
the
chasm
under
us
and
a
terrible
whirring
deafens
my
ears
the
flight
is
ended
we
pass
thru
a
door
leading
onto
the
ledge
wind
night
and
space
oh
terrible
height
why
have
we
sought
you
oh
bitter
wind
with
icy
invisible
wings
why
do
you
beat
us
why
would
you
bear
us
away
we
look
thru
the
miles
of
air
the
cold
blue
miles
between
us
and
the
city
over
the
edge
of
eternity
we
look
on
all
the
lights
a
thousand
times
more
numerous
than
the
stars
oh
lines
and
loops
of
light
in
unwound
chains
that
mark
for
miles
and
miles
the
vast
black
mazy
cobweb
of
the
streets
near
us
clusters
and
splashes
of
living
gold
that
change
far
off
to
bluish
steel
where
the
fragile
lights
on
the
jersey
shore
tremble
like
drops
of
dew
the
strident
noises
of
the
city
floating
up
to
us
are
hallowed
into
whispers
ferries
cross
thru
the
darkness
weaving
a
golden
thread
into
the
night
their
whistles
weird
shadows
of
sound
we
feel
the
millions
of
humanity
beneath
us
the
warm
millions
moving
under
the
roofs
consumed
by
their
own
desires
preparing
food
sobbing
alone
in
a
garret
with
burning
eyes
bending
over
a
needle
aimlessly
reading
the
evening
paper
dancing
in
the
naked
light
of
the
caf
eacute
laying
out
the
dead
bringing
a
child
to
birth
the
sorrow
the
torpor
the
bitterness
the
frail
joy
come
up
to
us
like
a
cold
fog
wrapping
us
round
oh
in
a
hundred
years
not
one
of
these
bodies
but
will
be
worthless
as
clay
the
anguish
the
torpor
the
toil
will
have
passed
to
other
millions
consumed
by
the
same
desires
ages
will
come
and
go
darkness
will
blot
the
lights
and
the
tower
will
be
laid
on
the
earth
the
sea
will
remain
black
and
unchanging
the
stars
will
look
down
brilliant
and
unconcerned
beloved
tho
sorrow
futility
defeat
surround
us
they
can
not
bear
us
down
here
on
the
abyss
of
eternity
love
has
crowned
us
for
a
moment
victors
at
night
we
are
apart
the
city
grows
quiet
between
us
she
hushes
herself
for
midnight
makes
heavy
her
eyes
the
tangle
of
traffic
is
ended
the
cars
are
empty
five
streets
divide
us
and
on
them
the
moonlight
lies
oh
are
you
asleep
or
iying
awake
my
lover
open
your
dreams
to
my
love
and
your
heart
to
my
words
i
send
you
my
air
between
us
is
laden
my
thoughts
fly
in
at
your
window
a
flock
of
wild
birds
the
years
i
close
my
eyes
and
see
a
strange
procession
passing
me
the
years
before
i
saw
your
face
go
by
me
with
a
wistful
grace
they
pass
the
sensitive
shy
years
as
one
who
strives
to
dance
half
blind
with
tears
the
years
went
by
and
never
knew
that
each
one
brought
me
nearer
you
their
path
was
narrow
and
apart
and
yet
it
led
me
to
your
heart
oh
sensitive
shy
years
oh
lonely
years
that
strove
to
sing
with
voices
drowned
in
tears
peace
peace
flows
into
me
as
the
tide
to
the
pool
by
the
shore
it
is
mine
forevermore
it
ebbs
not
back
like
the
sea
i
am
the
pool
of
blue
that
worships
the
vivid
sky
my
hopes
were
they
are
all
fulfilled
in
you
i
am
the
pool
of
gold
when
sunset
burns
and
dies
you
are
my
deepening
skies
give
me
your
stars
to
hold
april
the
roofs
are
shining
from
the
rain
the
sparrows
twitter
as
they
fly
and
with
a
windy
april
grace
the
little
clouds
go
by
yet
the
are
bare
and
brown
with
only
one
unchanging
tree
i
could
not
be
so
sure
of
spring
save
that
it
sings
in
me
come
come
when
the
pale
moon
like
a
petal
floats
in
the
pearly
dusk
of
spring
come
with
arms
outstretched
to
take
me
come
with
lips
pursed
up
to
cling
come
for
life
is
a
frail
moth
flying
caught
in
the
web
of
the
years
that
pass
and
soon
we
two
so
warm
and
eager
will
be
as
the
gray
stones
in
the
grass
moods
i
am
the
still
rain
falling
too
tired
for
singing
mirth
oh
be
the
green
fields
calling
oh
be
for
me
the
earth
i
am
the
brown
bird
pining
to
leave
the
nest
and
fly
oh
be
the
fresh
cloud
shining
oh
be
for
me
the
sky
april
song
willow
in
your
april
gown
delicate
and
gleaming
do
you
mind
in
years
gone
by
all
my
dreaming
spring
was
like
a
call
to
me
that
i
could
not
answer
i
was
chained
to
loneliness
i
the
dancer
willow
twinkling
in
the
sun
still
your
leaves
and
hear
me
i
can
answer
spring
at
last
love
is
near
me
may
day
the
shining
line
of
motors
the
swaying
the
prancing
dancing
horses
are
passing
by
for
us
the
sunlight
on
the
steeple
the
toys
we
stop
to
see
the
smiling
passing
people
are
all
for
you
and
me
i
love
you
and
i
love
you
and
oh
i
love
you
too
all
of
the
flower
girl
lilies
were
only
grown
for
you
fifth
avenue
and
april
and
love
and
lack
of
care
the
world
is
mad
with
music
too
beautiful
to
bear
crowned
i
wear
a
crown
invisible
and
clear
and
go
my
lifted
royal
way
apart
since
you
have
crowned
me
softly
in
your
heart
with
love
that
is
half
ardent
half
austere
and
as
a
queen
disguised
might
pass
anear
the
bitter
crowd
that
barters
in
a
mart
veiling
her
pride
while
tears
of
pity
start
i
hide
my
glory
thru
a
jealous
fear
my
crown
shall
stay
a
sweet
and
secret
thing
kept
pure
with
prayer
at
evensong
and
morn
and
when
you
come
to
take
it
from
my
head
i
shall
not
weep
nor
will
a
word
be
said
but
i
shall
kneel
before
you
oh
my
king
and
bind
my
brow
forever
with
a
thorn
to
a
castilian
song
we
held
the
book
together
timidly
whose
antique
music
in
an
alien
tongue
once
rose
among
the
vines
that
hung
beneath
a
high
castilian
balcony
i
felt
the
lute
strings
ancient
ecstasy
and
while
he
read
my
heart
was
stung
and
throbbed
as
where
an
ardent
bird
has
clung
the
branches
tremble
on
a
blossomed
tree
oh
lady
for
whose
sake
the
song
was
made
laid
long
ago
in
some
still
cypress
shade
divided
from
the
man
who
longed
for
thee
here
in
a
land
whose
name
he
never
heard
his
song
brought
love
as
april
brings
the
bird
and
not
a
breath
divides
my
love
from
me
broadway
this
is
the
quiet
hour
the
theaters
have
gathered
in
their
crowds
and
steadily
the
million
lights
blaze
on
for
few
to
see
robbing
the
sky
of
stars
that
should
be
hers
a
woman
waits
with
bag
and
shabby
furs
a
somber
man
drifts
by
and
only
we
pass
up
the
street
unwearied
warm
and
free
for
over
us
the
olden
magic
stirs
beneath
the
liquid
splendor
of
the
lights
we
live
a
little
ere
the
charm
is
spent
this
night
is
ours
of
all
the
golden
nights
the
pavement
an
enchanted
palace
floor
and
youth
the
player
on
the
viol
who
sent
a
strain
of
music
thru
an
open
door
a
winter
bluejay
crisply
the
bright
snow
whispered
crunching
beneath
our
feet
behind
us
as
we
walked
along
the
parkway
our
shadows
danced
fantastic
shapes
in
vivid
blue
across
the
lake
the
skaters
flew
to
and
fro
with
sharp
turns
weaving
a
frail
invisible
net
in
ecstasy
the
earth
drank
the
silver
sunlight
in
ecstasy
the
skaters
drank
the
wine
of
speed
in
ecstasy
we
laughed
drinking
the
wine
of
love
had
not
the
music
of
our
joy
sounded
its
highest
note
but
no
for
suddenly
with
lifted
eyes
you
said
oh
look
there
on
the
black
bough
of
a
snow
flecked
maple
fearless
and
gay
as
our
love
a
bluejay
cocked
his
crest
oh
who
can
tell
the
range
of
joy
or
set
the
bounds
of
beauty
in
a
restaurant
the
darkened
street
was
muffled
with
the
snow
the
falling
flakes
had
made
your
shoulders
white
and
when
we
found
a
shelter
from
the
night
its
glamor
fell
upon
us
like
a
blow
the
clash
of
dishes
and
the
viol
and
bow
mingled
beneath
the
fever
of
the
light
the
heat
was
full
of
savors
and
the
bright
laughter
of
women
lured
the
wine
to
flow
a
little
child
ate
nothing
while
she
sat
watching
a
woman
at
a
table
there
lean
to
a
kiss
beneath
a
drooping
hat
the
hour
went
by
we
rose
and
turned
to
go
the
somber
street
received
us
from
the
glare
and
once
more
on
your
shoulders
fell
the
snow
joy
i
am
wild
i
will
sing
to
the
trees
i
will
sing
to
the
stars
in
the
sky
i
love
i
am
loved
he
is
mine
now
at
last
i
can
die
i
am
sandaled
with
wind
and
with
flame
i
have
and
singing
to
give
i
can
tread
on
the
grass
or
the
stars
now
at
last
i
can
live
in
a
railroad
station
we
stood
in
the
shrill
electric
light
dumb
and
sick
in
the
whirling
din
we
who
had
all
of
love
to
say
and
a
single
second
to
say
it
in
you
turned
to
go
i
felt
the
train
slow
heavy
start
you
thought
to
see
me
cry
but
oh
my
tears
were
hidden
in
my
heart
in
the
train
fields
beneath
a
quilt
of
snow
from
which
the
rocks
and
stubble
peep
and
in
the
west
a
shy
white
star
that
shivers
as
it
wakes
from
sleep
the
restless
rumble
of
the
train
the
drowsy
people
in
the
car
steel
blue
twilight
in
the
world
and
in
my
heart
a
timid
star
to
one
away
i
heard
a
cry
in
the
night
a
thousand
miles
it
came
sharp
as
a
flash
of
light
my
name
my
name
it
was
your
voice
i
heard
you
waked
and
loved
me
so
i
send
you
back
this
word
i
know
i
know
song
love
me
with
your
whole
heart
or
give
no
love
to
me
is
a
poor
thing
neither
bond
nor
free
you
must
love
me
gladly
soul
and
body
too
or
else
find
a
new
love
and
to
you
deep
in
the
night
deep
in
the
night
the
cry
of
a
swallow
under
the
stars
he
flew
keen
as
pain
was
his
call
to
follow
over
the
world
to
you
love
in
my
heart
is
a
cry
forever
lost
as
the
swallow
flight
seeking
for
you
and
never
never
stilled
by
the
stars
at
night
the
india
wharf
here
in
the
velvet
stillness
the
wide
sown
fields
fall
to
the
faint
horizon
sleeping
in
starlight
a
year
ago
we
walked
in
the
jangling
city
together
forgetful
one
by
one
we
crossed
the
avenues
rivers
of
light
roaring
in
tumult
and
came
to
the
narrow
knotted
streets
thru
the
tense
crowd
we
went
aloof
ecstatic
walking
in
wonder
unconscious
of
our
motion
forever
the
foreign
people
with
dark
eyes
passed
us
and
passed
lights
and
foreign
words
and
foreign
faces
i
forgot
them
all
i
only
felt
alive
defiant
of
all
death
and
sorrow
sure
and
elated
that
was
the
gift
you
gave
me
the
streets
grew
still
more
tangled
and
led
at
last
to
water
black
and
glossy
flecked
here
and
there
with
lights
faint
and
far
off
there
on
a
shabby
building
was
a
sign
the
india
wharf
and
we
turned
back
i
always
felt
we
could
have
taken
ship
and
crossed
the
bright
green
seas
to
dreaming
cities
set
on
sacred
streams
and
palaces
of
ivory
and
scarlet
i
shall
not
care
when
i
am
dead
and
over
me
bright
april
shakes
out
her
hair
tho
you
should
lean
above
me
i
shall
not
care
i
shall
have
peace
as
leafy
trees
are
peaceful
when
rain
bends
down
the
bough
and
i
shall
be
more
silent
and
than
you
are
now
desert
pools
i
love
too
much
i
am
a
river
surging
with
spring
that
seeks
the
sea
i
am
too
generous
a
giver
love
will
not
stoop
to
drink
of
me
his
feet
will
turn
to
desert
places
shadowless
reft
of
rain
and
dew
where
stars
stare
down
with
sharpened
faces
from
heavens
pitilessly
blue
and
there
at
midnight
sick
with
faring
he
will
stoop
down
in
his
desire
to
slake
the
thirst
grown
past
all
bearing
in
stagnant
water
keen
as
fire
longing
i
am
not
sorry
for
my
soul
that
it
must
go
unsatisfied
for
it
can
live
a
thousand
times
eternity
is
deep
and
wide
i
am
not
sorry
for
my
soul
but
oh
my
body
that
must
go
back
to
a
little
drift
of
dust
without
the
joy
it
longed
to
know
pity
they
never
saw
my
lover
face
they
only
know
our
love
was
brief
wearing
awhile
a
windy
grace
and
passing
like
an
autumn
leaf
they
wonder
why
i
do
not
weep
they
think
it
strange
that
i
can
sing
they
say
her
love
was
scarcely
deep
since
it
has
left
so
slight
a
sting
they
never
saw
my
love
nor
knew
that
in
my
heart
most
secret
place
i
pity
them
as
angels
do
men
who
have
never
seen
god
face
after
parting
oh
i
have
sown
my
love
so
wide
that
he
will
find
it
everywhere
it
will
awake
him
in
the
night
it
will
enfold
him
in
the
air
i
set
my
shadow
in
his
sight
and
i
have
winged
it
with
desire
that
it
may
be
a
cloud
by
day
and
in
the
night
a
shaft
of
fire
enough
it
is
enough
for
me
by
day
to
walk
the
same
bright
earth
with
him
enough
that
over
us
by
night
the
same
great
roof
of
stars
is
dim
i
have
no
care
to
bind
the
wind
or
set
a
fetter
on
the
sea
it
is
enough
to
feel
his
love
blow
by
like
music
over
me
alchemy
i
lift
my
heart
as
spring
lifts
up
a
yellow
daisy
to
the
rain
my
heart
will
be
a
lovely
cup
altho
it
holds
but
pain
for
i
shall
learn
from
flower
and
leaf
that
color
every
drop
they
hold
to
change
the
lifeless
wine
of
grief
to
living
gold
february
they
spoke
of
him
i
love
with
cruel
words
and
gay
my
lips
kept
silent
guard
on
all
i
could
not
say
i
heard
and
down
the
street
the
lonely
trees
in
the
square
stood
in
the
winter
wind
patient
and
bare
i
heard
oh
voiceless
trees
under
the
wind
i
knew
the
eager
terrible
spring
hidden
in
you
morning
i
went
out
on
an
april
morning
all
alone
for
my
heart
was
high
i
was
a
child
of
the
shining
meadow
i
was
a
sister
of
the
sky
there
in
the
windy
flood
of
morning
longing
lifted
its
weight
from
me
lost
as
a
sob
in
the
midst
of
cheering
swept
as
a
out
to
sea
may
night
the
spring
is
fresh
and
fearless
and
every
leaf
is
new
the
world
is
brimmed
with
moonlight
the
lilac
brimmed
with
dew
here
in
the
moving
shadows
i
catch
my
breath
and
sing
my
heart
is
fresh
and
fearless
and
with
spring
dusk
in
june
evening
and
all
the
birds
in
a
chorus
of
shimmering
sound
are
easing
their
hearts
of
joy
for
miles
around
the
air
is
blue
and
sweet
the
few
first
stars
are
white
oh
let
me
like
the
birds
sing
before
night
i
am
free
of
love
as
a
bird
flying
south
in
the
autumn
swift
and
intent
asking
no
joy
from
another
glad
to
forget
all
of
the
passion
of
april
ere
it
was
i
am
free
of
love
and
i
listen
to
music
lightly
but
if
he
returned
if
he
should
look
at
me
deeply
i
should
awake
i
should
awake
and
remember
i
am
my
lover
summer
night
riverside
in
the
wild
soft
summer
darkness
how
many
and
many
a
night
we
two
together
sat
in
the
park
and
watched
the
hudson
wearing
her
lights
like
golden
spangles
glinting
on
black
satin
the
rail
along
the
curving
pathway
was
low
in
a
happy
place
to
let
us
cross
and
down
the
hill
a
tree
that
dripped
with
bloom
sheltered
us
while
your
kisses
and
the
flowers
falling
falling
tangled
my
hair
the
frail
white
stars
moved
slowly
over
the
sky
and
now
far
off
in
the
fragrant
darkness
the
tree
is
tremulous
again
with
bloom
for
june
comes
back
what
girl
when
she
goes
home
dreamily
before
her
mirror
shakes
from
her
hair
this
year
blossoms
clinging
in
its
coils
in
a
subway
station
after
a
year
i
came
again
to
the
place
the
tireless
lights
and
the
reverberation
the
angry
thunder
of
trains
that
burrow
the
ground
the
hunted
hurrying
people
were
still
the
same
but
oh
another
man
beside
me
and
not
you
another
voice
and
other
eyes
in
mine
and
suddenly
i
turned
and
saw
again
the
gleaming
curve
of
tracks
the
bridge
above
they
were
burned
deep
into
my
heart
before
the
night
i
watched
them
to
avoid
your
eyes
when
you
were
saying
oh
look
up
at
me
when
you
were
saying
will
you
never
love
me
and
when
i
answered
with
a
lie
oh
then
you
dropped
your
eyes
i
felt
your
utter
pain
i
would
have
died
to
say
the
truth
to
you
after
a
year
i
came
again
to
the
place
the
hunted
hurrying
people
were
still
the
same
after
love
there
is
no
magic
when
we
meet
we
speak
as
other
people
do
you
work
no
miracle
for
me
nor
i
for
you
you
were
the
wind
and
i
the
sea
there
is
no
splendor
any
more
i
have
grown
listless
as
the
pool
beside
the
shore
but
tho
the
pool
is
safe
from
storm
and
from
the
tide
has
found
surcease
it
grows
more
bitter
than
the
sea
for
all
its
peace
dooryard
roses
i
have
come
the
selfsame
path
to
the
selfsame
door
years
have
left
the
roses
there
burning
as
before
while
i
watch
them
in
the
wind
quick
the
hot
tears
start
strange
so
frail
a
flame
outlasts
fire
in
the
heart
a
prayer
until
i
lose
my
soul
and
lie
blind
to
the
beauty
of
the
earth
deaf
tho
a
lyric
wind
goes
by
dumb
in
a
storm
of
mirth
until
my
heart
is
quenched
at
length
and
i
have
left
the
land
of
men
oh
let
me
love
with
all
my
strength
careless
if
i
am
loved
again
ii
indian
summer
lyric
night
of
the
lingering
indian
summer
shadowy
fields
that
are
scentless
but
full
of
singing
never
a
bird
but
the
passionless
chant
of
insects
ceaseless
insistent
the
grasshopper
horn
and
far
off
high
in
the
maples
the
wheel
of
a
locust
leisurely
grinding
the
silence
under
a
moon
waning
and
worn
and
broken
tired
with
summer
let
me
remember
you
voices
of
little
insects
weeds
in
the
moonlight
fields
that
are
tangled
with
asters
let
me
remember
you
soon
will
the
winter
be
on
us
and
heartless
over
my
soul
murmur
your
mute
benediction
while
i
gaze
oh
fields
that
rest
after
harvest
as
those
who
part
look
long
in
the
eyes
they
lean
to
lest
they
forget
them
the
sea
wind
i
am
a
pool
in
a
peaceful
place
i
greet
the
great
sky
face
to
face
i
know
the
stars
and
the
stately
moon
and
the
wind
that
runs
with
rippling
shoon
but
why
does
it
always
bring
to
me
the
beautiful
sound
of
the
sea
the
weaves
me
a
wall
of
green
but
the
wind
comes
whispering
in
between
in
the
dead
of
night
when
the
sky
is
deep
the
wind
comes
waking
me
out
of
sleep
why
does
it
always
bring
to
me
the
terrible
call
of
the
sea
the
cloud
i
am
a
cloud
in
the
heaven
height
the
stars
are
lit
for
my
delight
tireless
and
changeful
swift
and
free
i
cast
my
shadow
on
hill
and
sea
but
why
do
the
pines
on
the
mountain
crest
call
to
me
always
rest
rest
i
throw
my
mantle
over
the
moon
and
i
blind
the
sun
on
his
throne
at
noon
nothing
can
tame
me
nothing
can
bind
i
am
a
child
of
the
heartless
wind
but
oh
the
pines
on
the
mountain
crest
whispering
always
rest
rest
the
poor
house
hope
went
by
and
peace
went
by
and
would
not
enter
in
youth
went
by
and
health
went
by
and
love
that
is
their
kin
those
within
the
house
shed
tears
on
their
bitter
bread
some
were
old
and
some
were
mad
and
some
were
sick
gray
death
saw
the
wretched
house
and
even
he
passed
by
they
have
never
lived
he
said
they
can
wait
to
die
new
year
dawn
broadway
when
the
horns
wear
thin
and
the
noise
like
a
garment
outworn
falls
from
the
night
the
tattered
and
shivering
night
that
thinks
she
is
gay
when
the
patient
silence
comes
back
and
retires
and
returns
rebuffed
by
a
ribald
song
wounded
by
vehement
cries
fleeing
again
to
the
stars
ashamed
of
her
sister
the
night
oh
then
they
steal
home
the
blinded
the
pitiful
ones
with
their
still
in
their
hands
reeling
with
odorous
breath
and
thick
coarse
words
on
their
tongues
they
get
them
to
bed
somehow
and
sleep
the
forgiving
comes
thru
the
scattering
tumult
and
closes
their
eyes
the
stars
sink
down
ashamed
and
the
dawn
awakes
like
a
youth
who
steals
from
a
brothel
dizzy
and
sick
the
star
a
white
star
born
in
the
evening
glow
looked
to
the
round
green
world
below
and
saw
a
pool
in
a
wooded
place
that
held
like
a
jewel
her
mirrored
face
she
said
to
the
pool
oh
wondrous
deep
i
love
you
i
give
you
my
light
to
keep
oh
more
profound
than
the
moving
sea
that
never
has
shown
myself
to
me
oh
fathomless
as
the
sky
is
far
hold
forever
your
tremulous
star
but
out
of
the
woods
as
night
grew
cool
a
brown
pig
came
to
the
little
pool
it
grunted
and
splashed
and
waded
in
and
the
deepest
place
but
reached
its
chin
the
water
gurgled
with
tender
glee
and
the
mud
churned
up
in
it
turbidly
the
star
grew
pale
and
hid
her
face
in
a
bit
of
floating
cloud
like
lace
doctors
every
night
i
lie
awake
and
every
day
i
lie
abed
and
hear
the
doctors
pain
and
death
conferring
at
my
head
they
speak
in
scientific
tones
professional
and
low
one
argues
for
a
speedy
cure
the
other
sure
and
slow
to
one
so
humble
as
myself
it
should
be
matter
for
some
pride
to
have
such
noted
fellows
here
conferring
at
my
side
the
inn
of
earth
i
came
to
the
crowded
inn
of
earth
and
called
for
a
cup
of
wine
but
the
host
went
by
with
averted
eye
from
a
thirst
as
keen
as
mine
then
i
sat
down
with
weariness
and
asked
a
bit
of
bread
but
the
host
went
by
with
averted
eye
and
never
a
word
he
said
while
always
from
the
outer
night
the
waiting
souls
came
in
with
stifled
cries
of
sharp
surprise
at
all
the
light
and
din
then
give
me
a
bed
to
sleep
i
said
for
midnight
comes
apace
but
the
host
went
by
with
averted
eye
and
i
never
saw
his
face
since
there
is
neither
food
nor
rest
i
go
where
i
fared
before
but
the
host
went
by
with
averted
eye
and
barred
the
outer
door
in
the
carpenter
shop
mary
sat
in
the
corner
dreaming
dim
was
the
room
and
low
while
in
the
dusk
the
saw
went
screaming
to
and
fro
jesus
and
joseph
toiled
together
mary
was
watching
them
thinking
of
kings
in
the
wintry
weather
at
bethlehem
mary
sat
in
the
corner
thinking
jesus
had
grown
a
man
one
by
one
her
hopes
were
sinking
as
the
years
ran
jesus
and
joseph
toiled
together
mary
thoughts
were
far
angels
sang
in
the
wintry
weather
under
a
star
mary
sat
in
the
corner
weeping
bitter
and
hot
her
tears
little
faith
were
the
angels
keeping
all
the
years
the
carpenter
son
the
summer
dawn
came
the
earth
was
like
hot
iron
at
noon
in
nazareth
there
fell
no
rain
to
ease
the
heat
and
dusk
drew
on
with
tired
feet
and
stifled
breath
the
shop
was
low
and
hot
and
square
and
wood
made
sharp
the
air
while
all
day
long
the
saw
went
tearing
thru
the
oak
that
moaned
as
tho
the
tree
heart
broke
beneath
its
wrong
the
narrow
street
was
full
of
cries
of
bickering
and
snarling
lies
in
many
keys
the
tongues
of
egypt
and
of
rome
and
lands
beyond
the
shifting
foam
of
windy
seas
sometimes
a
ruler
riding
fast
scattered
the
dark
crowds
as
he
passed
and
drove
them
close
in
doorways
drawing
broken
breath
lest
they
be
trampled
to
their
death
where
the
dust
rose
there
in
the
gathering
night
and
noise
a
group
of
galilean
boys
crowding
to
see
gray
joseph
toiling
with
his
son
saw
jesus
when
the
task
was
done
turn
wearily
he
passed
them
by
with
hurried
tread
silently
nor
raised
his
head
he
who
looked
up
drinking
all
beauty
from
his
birth
out
of
the
heaven
and
the
earth
as
from
a
cup
and
mary
who
was
growing
old
knew
that
the
pottage
would
be
cold
when
he
returned
he
hungered
only
for
the
night
and
westward
bending
sharp
and
bright
the
thin
moon
burned
he
reached
the
open
western
gate
where
whining
halt
and
leper
wait
and
came
at
last
to
the
blue
desert
where
the
deep
great
seas
of
twilight
lay
asleep
windless
and
vast
with
shining
eyes
the
stars
awoke
the
dew
lay
heavy
on
his
cloak
the
world
was
dim
and
in
the
stillness
he
could
hear
his
secret
thoughts
draw
very
near
and
call
to
him
faint
voices
lifted
shrill
with
pain
and
multitudinous
as
rain
from
all
the
lands
and
all
the
villages
thereof
men
crying
for
the
gift
of
love
with
outstretched
hands
voices
that
called
with
ceaseless
crying
the
broken
and
the
blind
the
dying
and
those
grown
dumb
beneath
oppression
and
he
heard
upon
their
lips
a
single
word
come
their
cries
engulfed
him
like
the
night
the
moon
put
out
her
placid
light
and
black
and
low
nearer
the
heavy
thunder
drew
hushing
the
voices
yet
he
knew
that
he
would
go
a
thread
of
lightning
burns
and
for
a
flash
the
day
returns
he
only
hears
joseph
an
old
man
bent
and
white
toiling
alone
from
morn
till
night
thru
all
the
years
swift
clouds
make
all
the
heavens
blind
a
storm
is
running
on
the
wind
he
only
sees
how
mary
will
stretch
out
her
hands
sobbing
who
never
understands
voices
like
these
the
mother
of
a
poet
she
is
too
kind
i
think
for
mortal
things
too
gentle
for
the
gusty
ways
of
earth
god
gave
to
her
a
shy
and
silver
mirth
and
made
her
soul
as
clear
and
softly
singing
as
an
orchard
in
sheltered
hollows
all
the
sunny
year
a
spring
that
thru
the
leaning
grass
looks
up
and
holds
all
heaven
in
its
clarid
cup
mirror
to
holy
meadows
high
and
blue
with
stars
like
drops
of
dew
i
love
to
think
that
never
tears
at
night
have
made
her
eyes
less
bright
that
all
her
girlhood
thru
never
a
cry
of
love
made
her
voice
innocence
that
in
her
hands
have
lain
flowers
beaten
by
the
rain
and
little
birds
before
they
learned
to
sing
drowned
in
the
sudden
ecstasy
of
spring
i
love
to
think
that
with
a
wistful
wonder
she
held
her
baby
warm
against
her
breast
that
never
any
fear
awoke
whereunder
she
shuddered
at
her
gift
or
trembled
lest
thru
the
great
doors
of
birth
here
to
a
windy
earth
she
lured
from
heaven
a
guest
she
caught
and
kept
his
first
vague
flickering
smile
the
faint
upleaping
of
his
spirit
fire
and
for
a
long
sweet
while
in
her
was
all
he
asked
of
earth
or
heaven
but
in
the
end
how
far
past
every
shaken
star
should
leap
at
last
that
desire
his
manhood
keen
ardor
toward
the
unseen
dark
mystery
beyond
the
pleiads
seven
and
in
her
heart
she
heard
his
first
word
she
only
of
them
all
could
understand
flushing
to
feel
at
last
the
silence
thrilling
as
tho
her
hand
had
touched
god
hand
but
in
the
end
how
many
words
winged
on
a
flight
she
could
not
follow
farther
than
skyward
lark
or
swallow
his
lips
should
free
to
lands
she
never
knew
braver
than
white
birds
with
a
fearless
melody
flying
over
a
shining
sea
a
song
between
the
blue
and
blue
oh
i
have
seen
a
lake
as
clear
and
fair
as
it
were
molten
air
lifting
a
lily
upward
to
the
sun
how
should
the
water
know
the
glowing
heart
that
ever
to
the
heaven
lifts
its
fire
a
golden
and
unchangeable
desire
the
water
only
knows
the
faint
and
rosy
glows
of
opening
apart
yet
in
the
soul
of
earth
deep
in
the
primal
ground
its
searching
roots
are
wound
and
centuries
have
struggled
toward
its
birth
so
in
the
man
who
sings
all
of
the
voiceless
horde
from
the
cold
dawn
of
things
have
their
reward
all
in
whose
pulses
ran
blood
that
is
his
at
last
from
the
first
stooping
man
far
in
the
winnowed
past
out
of
the
tumult
of
their
love
and
mating
each
one
created
seeing
life
was
good
dumb
till
at
last
the
song
that
they
were
waiting
breaks
like
brave
april
thru
a
wintry
wood
rivers
to
the
sea
but
what
of
her
whose
heart
is
troubled
by
it
the
mother
who
would
soothe
and
set
him
free
fearing
the
song
ecstasy
oh
as
the
moon
that
has
no
power
to
quiet
the
strong
sea
in
memoriam
you
go
a
long
and
lovely
journey
for
all
the
stars
like
burning
dew
are
luminous
and
luring
footprints
of
souls
adventurous
as
you
oh
if
you
lived
on
earth
elated
how
is
it
now
that
you
can
run
free
of
the
weight
of
flesh
and
faring
far
past
the
birthplace
of
the
sun
twilight
the
stately
tragedy
of
dusk
drew
to
its
perfect
close
the
virginal
white
evening
star
sank
and
the
red
moon
rose
swallow
flight
i
love
my
hour
of
wind
and
light
i
love
men
faces
and
their
eyes
i
love
my
spirit
veering
flight
like
swallows
under
evening
skies
thoughts
when
i
can
make
my
thoughts
come
forth
to
walk
like
ladies
up
and
down
each
one
puts
on
before
the
glass
her
most
becoming
hat
and
gown
but
oh
the
shy
and
eager
thoughts
that
hide
and
will
not
get
them
dressed
why
is
it
that
they
always
seem
so
much
more
lovely
than
the
rest
to
dick
on
his
sixth
birthday
tho
i
am
very
old
and
wise
and
you
are
neither
wise
nor
old
when
i
look
far
into
your
eyes
i
know
things
i
was
never
told
i
know
how
flame
must
strain
and
fret
prisoned
in
a
mortal
net
how
joy
with
wings
bruises
the
small
heart
where
he
sings
how
too
much
life
like
too
much
gold
is
sometimes
very
hard
to
hold
all
that
is
talking
i
know
this
much
is
true
six
years
ago
an
angel
living
near
the
moon
walked
thru
the
sky
and
sang
a
tune
plucking
stars
to
make
his
crown
and
suddenly
two
stars
fell
down
two
falling
arrows
made
of
light
six
years
ago
this
very
night
i
saw
them
fall
and
wondered
why
the
angel
dropped
them
from
the
sky
but
when
i
saw
your
eyes
i
knew
the
angel
sent
the
stars
to
you
to
rose
rose
when
i
remember
you
little
lady
scarcely
two
i
am
suddenly
aware
of
the
angels
in
the
air
all
your
softly
gracious
ways
make
an
island
in
my
days
where
my
thoughts
fly
back
to
be
sheltered
from
too
strong
a
sea
all
your
luminous
delight
shines
before
me
in
the
night
when
i
grope
for
sleep
and
find
only
shadows
in
my
mind
rose
when
i
remember
you
white
and
glowing
pink
and
new
with
so
swift
a
sense
of
fun
altho
life
has
just
begun
with
so
sure
a
pride
of
place
in
your
very
infant
face
i
should
like
to
make
a
prayer
to
the
angels
in
the
air
if
an
angel
ever
brings
me
a
baby
in
her
wings
please
be
certain
that
it
grows
very
very
much
like
rose
the
fountain
on
in
the
deep
blue
night
the
fountain
sang
alone
it
sang
to
the
drowsy
heart
of
the
satyr
carved
in
stone
the
fountain
sang
and
sang
but
the
satyr
never
stirred
only
the
great
white
moon
in
the
empty
heaven
heard
the
fountain
sang
and
sang
and
on
the
marble
rim
the
peacocks
slept
their
dreams
were
strange
and
dim
bright
dew
was
on
the
grass
and
on
the
ilex
dew
the
dreamy
birds
were
all
too
the
fountain
sang
and
sang
the
things
one
can
not
tell
the
dreaming
peacocks
stirred
and
the
gleaming
fell
the
rose
beneath
my
chamber
window
pierrot
was
singing
singing
i
heard
his
lute
the
whole
night
thru
until
the
east
was
red
alas
alas
pierrot
i
had
no
rose
for
flinging
save
one
that
drank
my
tears
for
dew
before
its
leaves
were
dead
i
found
it
in
the
darkness
i
kissed
it
once
and
threw
it
the
petals
scattered
over
him
his
song
was
turned
to
joy
and
he
will
never
know
alas
the
one
who
knew
it
the
rose
was
plucked
when
dusk
was
dim
beside
a
laughing
boy
dreams
i
gave
my
life
to
another
lover
i
gave
my
love
and
all
and
all
but
over
a
dream
the
past
will
hover
out
of
a
dream
the
past
will
call
i
tear
myself
from
sleep
with
a
shiver
but
on
my
breast
a
kiss
is
hot
and
by
my
bed
the
ghostly
giver
is
waiting
tho
i
see
him
not
i
am
not
yours
i
am
not
yours
not
lost
in
you
not
lost
altho
i
long
to
be
lost
as
a
candle
lit
at
noon
lost
as
a
in
the
sea
you
love
me
and
i
find
you
still
a
spirit
beautiful
and
bright
yet
i
am
i
who
long
to
be
lost
as
a
light
is
lost
in
light
oh
plunge
me
deep
in
love
put
out
my
senses
leave
me
deaf
and
blind
swept
by
the
tempest
of
your
love
a
taper
in
a
rushing
wind
pierrot
song
for
a
picture
by
dugald
walker
lady
light
in
the
east
hangs
low
draw
your
veils
of
dream
apart
under
the
casement
stands
pierrot
making
a
song
to
ease
his
heart
yet
do
not
break
the
song
too
soon
i
love
to
sing
in
the
paling
moon
the
petals
are
falling
heavy
with
dew
the
stars
have
fainted
out
of
the
sky
come
to
me
come
or
else
i
too
faint
with
the
weight
of
love
will
die
she
comes
alas
i
hoped
to
make
another
stanza
for
her
sake
night
in
arizona
the
moon
is
a
charring
ember
dying
into
the
dark
off
in
the
crouching
mountains
coyotes
bark
the
stars
are
heavy
in
heaven
too
great
for
the
sky
to
hold
what
if
they
fell
and
shattered
the
earth
with
gold
no
lights
are
over
the
mesa
the
wind
is
hard
and
wild
i
stand
at
the
darkened
window
and
cry
like
a
child
dusk
in
war
time
a
more
and
you
will
lean
to
gather
me
close
in
the
old
sweet
way
but
oh
to
the
woman
over
the
sea
who
will
come
at
the
close
of
day
a
more
and
i
will
hear
the
key
in
the
latch
and
the
strong
quick
tread
but
oh
the
woman
over
the
sea
waiting
at
dusk
for
one
who
is
dead
spring
in
war
time
i
feel
the
spring
far
off
far
off
the
faint
far
scent
of
bud
and
leaf
oh
how
can
spring
take
heart
to
come
to
a
world
in
grief
deep
grief
the
sun
turns
north
the
days
grow
long
later
the
evening
star
grows
bright
how
can
the
daylight
linger
on
for
men
to
fight
still
fight
the
grass
is
waking
in
the
ground
soon
it
will
rise
and
blow
in
waves
how
can
it
have
the
heart
to
sway
over
the
graves
new
graves
under
the
boughs
where
lovers
walked
the
will
shed
their
breath
but
what
of
all
the
lovers
now
parted
by
death
gray
death
while
i
may
wind
and
hail
and
veering
rain
driven
mist
that
veils
the
day
soul
distress
and
body
pain
i
would
bear
you
while
i
may
i
would
love
you
if
i
might
for
so
soon
my
life
will
be
buried
in
a
lasting
night
even
pain
denied
to
me
debt
what
do
i
owe
to
you
who
loved
me
deep
and
long
you
never
gave
my
spirit
wings
or
gave
my
heart
a
song
but
oh
to
him
i
loved
who
loved
me
not
at
all
i
owe
the
little
open
gate
that
led
thru
heaven
wall
from
the
north
the
northern
woods
are
delicately
sweet
the
lake
is
folded
softly
by
the
shore
but
i
am
restless
for
the
subway
roar
the
thunder
and
the
hurrying
of
feet
i
try
to
sleep
but
still
my
eyelids
beat
against
the
image
of
the
tower
that
bore
me
high
aloft
as
if
thru
heaven
door
i
watched
the
world
from
god
unshaken
seat
i
would
go
back
and
breathe
with
quickened
sense
the
tunnel
strong
hot
breath
of
powdered
steel
but
at
the
ferries
i
should
leave
the
tense
dark
air
behind
and
i
should
mount
and
be
one
among
many
who
are
thrilled
to
feel
the
first
keen
from
the
open
sea
the
lights
of
new
york
the
lightning
spun
your
garment
for
the
night
of
silver
filaments
with
fire
shot
thru
a
broidery
of
lamps
that
lit
for
you
the
steadfast
splendor
of
enduring
light
the
moon
drifts
dimly
in
the
heaven
height
watching
with
wonder
how
the
earth
she
knew
that
lay
so
long
wrapped
deep
in
dark
and
dew
should
wear
upon
her
breast
a
star
so
white
the
festivals
of
babylon
were
dark
with
flaring
flambeaux
that
the
wind
blew
down
the
saturnalia
were
a
wild
boy
lark
with
torches
dripping
thru
the
town
but
you
have
found
a
god
and
filched
from
him
a
fire
that
neither
wind
nor
rain
can
dim
sea
longing
a
thousand
miles
beyond
this
wall
somewhere
the
waves
creep
cool
along
the
sand
the
ebbing
tide
forsakes
the
listless
land
with
the
old
murmur
long
and
musical
the
windy
waves
mount
up
and
curve
and
fall
and
round
the
rocks
the
foam
blows
up
like
snow
tho
i
am
inland
far
i
hear
and
know
for
i
was
born
the
sea
eternal
thrall
i
would
that
i
were
there
and
over
me
the
cold
insistence
of
the
tide
would
roll
quenching
this
burning
thing
men
call
the
soul
then
with
the
ebbing
i
should
drift
and
be
less
than
the
smallest
shell
along
the
shoal
less
than
the
calling
to
the
sea
the
river
i
came
from
the
sunny
valleys
and
sought
for
the
open
sea
for
i
thought
in
its
gray
expanses
my
peace
would
come
to
me
i
came
at
last
to
the
ocean
and
found
it
wild
and
black
and
i
cried
to
the
windless
valleys
be
kind
and
take
me
back
but
the
thirsty
tide
ran
inland
and
the
salt
waves
drank
of
me
and
i
who
was
fresh
as
the
rainfall
am
bitter
as
the
sea
leaves
one
by
one
like
leaves
from
a
tree
all
my
faiths
have
forsaken
me
but
the
stars
above
my
head
burn
in
white
and
delicate
red
and
beneath
my
feet
the
earth
brings
the
sturdy
grass
to
birth
i
who
was
content
to
be
but
a
tree
but
a
rustle
of
delight
in
the
wistful
heart
of
night
i
have
lost
the
leaves
that
knew
touch
of
rain
and
weight
of
dew
blinded
by
a
leafy
crown
i
looked
neither
up
nor
down
but
the
little
leaves
that
die
have
left
me
room
to
see
the
sky
now
for
the
first
time
i
know
stars
above
and
earth
below
the
answer
when
i
go
back
to
earth
and
all
my
joyous
body
puts
off
the
red
and
white
that
once
had
been
so
proud
if
men
should
pass
above
with
false
and
feeble
pity
my
dust
will
find
a
voice
to
answer
them
aloud
be
still
i
am
content
take
back
your
poor
compassion
joy
was
a
flame
in
me
too
steady
to
destroy
lithe
as
a
bending
reed
loving
the
storm
that
sways
her
i
found
more
joy
in
sorrow
than
you
could
find
in
joy
iii
over
the
roofs
i
oh
chimes
set
high
on
the
sunny
tower
ring
on
ring
on
unendingly
make
all
the
hours
a
single
hour
for
when
the
dusk
begins
to
flower
the
man
i
love
will
come
to
me
but
no
go
slowly
as
you
will
i
should
not
bid
you
hasten
so
for
while
i
wait
for
love
to
come
some
other
girl
is
standing
dumb
fearing
her
love
will
go
ii
oh
white
steam
over
the
roofs
blow
high
oh
chimes
in
the
tower
ring
clear
and
free
oh
sun
awake
in
the
covered
sky
for
the
man
i
love
loves
me
i
oh
drifting
steam
disperse
and
die
oh
tower
stand
shrouded
toward
the
south
fate
heard
afar
my
happy
cry
and
laid
her
finger
on
my
mouth
iii
the
dusk
was
blue
with
blowing
mist
the
lights
were
spangles
in
a
veil
and
from
the
clamor
far
below
floated
faint
music
like
a
wail
it
voiced
what
i
shall
never
speak
my
heart
was
breaking
all
night
long
but
when
the
dawn
was
hard
and
gray
my
tears
distilled
into
a
song
iv
i
said
i
have
shut
my
heart
as
one
shuts
an
open
door
that
love
may
starve
therein
and
trouble
me
no
more
but
over
the
roofs
there
came
the
wet
new
wind
of
may
and
a
tune
blew
up
from
the
curb
where
the
play
my
room
was
white
with
the
sun
and
love
cried
out
in
me
i
am
strong
i
will
break
your
heart
unless
you
set
me
free
a
cry
oh
there
are
eyes
that
he
can
see
and
hands
to
make
his
hands
rejoice
but
to
my
lover
i
must
be
only
a
voice
oh
there
are
breasts
to
bear
his
head
and
lips
whereon
his
lips
can
lie
but
i
must
be
till
i
am
dead
only
a
cry
chance
how
many
times
we
must
have
met
here
on
the
street
as
strangers
do
children
of
chance
we
were
who
passed
the
door
of
heaven
and
never
knew
immortal
so
soon
my
body
will
have
gone
beyond
the
sound
and
sight
of
men
and
tho
it
wakes
and
suffers
now
its
sleep
will
be
unbroken
then
but
oh
my
frail
immortal
soul
that
will
not
sleep
forevermore
a
leaf
borne
onward
by
the
blast
a
wave
that
never
finds
the
shore
after
death
now
while
my
lips
are
living
their
words
must
stay
unsaid
and
will
my
soul
remember
to
speak
when
i
am
dead
yet
if
my
soul
remembered
you
would
not
heed
it
dear
for
now
you
must
not
listen
and
then
you
could
not
hear
testament
i
said
i
will
take
my
life
and
throw
it
away
i
who
was
fire
and
song
will
turn
to
clay
i
will
lie
no
more
in
the
night
with
shaken
breath
i
will
toss
my
heart
in
the
air
to
be
caught
by
death
but
out
of
the
night
i
heard
like
the
inland
sound
of
the
sea
the
hushed
and
terrible
sob
of
all
humanity
then
i
said
oh
who
am
i
to
scorn
god
to
his
face
i
will
bow
my
head
and
stay
and
suffer
with
my
race
gifts
i
gave
my
first
love
laughter
i
gave
my
second
tears
i
gave
my
third
love
silence
thru
all
the
years
my
first
love
gave
me
singing
my
second
eyes
to
see
but
oh
it
was
my
third
love
who
gave
my
soul
to
me
iv
from
the
sea
all
beauty
calls
you
to
me
and
you
seem
past
twice
a
thousand
miles
of
shifting
sea
to
reach
me
you
are
as
the
wind
i
breathe
here
on
the
ship
topmost
deck
with
only
light
between
the
heavens
and
me
i
feel
your
spirit
and
i
close
my
eyes
knowing
the
bright
hair
blowing
in
the
sun
the
eager
whisper
and
the
searching
eyes
listen
i
love
you
do
not
turn
your
face
nor
touch
me
only
stand
and
watch
awhile
the
blue
unbroken
circle
of
the
sea
look
far
away
and
let
me
ease
my
heart
of
words
that
beat
in
it
with
broken
wing
look
far
away
and
if
i
say
too
much
forget
that
i
am
speaking
only
watch
how
like
a
gull
that
sparkling
sinks
to
rest
the
drifts
along
a
happy
wave
toward
the
bright
verge
the
boundary
of
the
world
i
am
so
weak
a
thing
praise
me
for
this
that
in
some
strange
way
i
was
strong
enough
to
keep
my
love
unuttered
and
to
stand
altho
i
longed
to
kneel
to
you
that
night
you
looked
at
me
with
eyes
was
i
not
calm
and
if
you
guessed
my
love
you
thought
it
something
delicate
and
free
soft
as
the
sound
of
in
the
wind
fleeting
as
phosphorescent
stars
in
foam
yet
in
my
heart
there
was
a
beating
storm
bending
my
thoughts
before
it
and
i
strove
to
say
too
little
lest
i
say
too
much
and
from
my
eyes
to
drive
love
happy
shame
yet
when
i
heard
your
name
the
first
far
time
it
seemed
like
other
names
to
me
and
i
was
all
unconscious
as
a
dreaming
river
that
nears
at
last
its
long
predestined
sea
and
when
you
spoke
to
me
i
did
not
know
that
to
my
life
high
altar
came
its
priest
but
now
i
know
between
my
god
and
me
you
stand
forever
nearer
god
than
i
and
in
your
hands
with
faith
and
utter
joy
i
would
that
i
could
lay
my
woman
soul
oh
my
love
to
whom
i
can
not
come
with
any
gift
of
body
or
of
soul
i
pass
and
go
but
sometimes
when
you
hear
blown
back
to
you
my
wistful
singing
touched
with
tears
know
that
i
sang
for
you
alone
to
hear
and
that
i
wondered
if
the
wind
would
bring
to
him
who
tuned
my
heart
its
distant
song
so
might
a
woman
who
in
loneliness
had
borne
a
child
dreaming
of
days
to
come
wonder
if
it
would
please
its
father
eyes
but
long
before
i
ever
heard
your
name
always
the
undertone
unchanging
note
in
all
my
singing
had
prefigured
you
foretold
you
as
a
spark
foretells
a
flame
yet
i
was
free
as
an
untethered
cloud
in
the
great
space
between
the
sky
and
sea
and
might
have
blown
before
the
wind
of
joy
like
a
bright
banner
woven
by
the
sun
i
did
not
know
the
longing
in
the
night
you
who
have
waked
me
can
not
give
me
sleep
all
things
in
all
the
world
can
rest
but
i
even
the
smooth
brief
respite
of
a
wave
when
it
gives
up
its
broken
crown
of
foam
even
that
little
rest
i
may
not
have
and
yet
all
quiet
loves
of
friends
all
joy
in
all
the
piercing
beauty
of
the
world
i
would
give
up
go
blind
forevermore
rather
than
have
god
blot
from
out
my
soul
remembrance
of
your
voice
that
said
my
name
for
us
no
starlight
stilled
the
april
fields
no
birds
awoke
in
darkling
trees
for
us
yet
where
we
walked

city

that
night
felt
in
our
feet
the
singing
fire
of
spring
and
in
our
path
we
left
a
trail
of
light
soft
as

phosphorescence

shall
seek
for

bringing
back

over

you

kind
that
every
lover
may
be
given
love

shall
not
hasten
lest
the
paving
stones
should
echo
with

awake
those
who
are
warm
beneath
the
cloak
of
sleep
lest
they
should
rise
and
see
me
and
should
say
whither
goes
sappho
lonely
in
the
night
whither
goes
sappho
whither
all
men
go
but
they
go
driven
straining
back
with
fear
and
sappho
goes
as
lightly
as
a
leaf
blown
from
brown
autumn
forests
to
the
sea
here
on
the
rock
zeus
lifted
from
the
waves
i
shall
await
the
waking
of
the
dawn
lying
beneath
the
weight
of
dark
as
one
lies
breathless
till
the
lover
shall
awake
and
with
the
sun
the
sea
shall
cover
me

shall
be
less
than
the
dissolving
foam
murmuring
and
melting
on
the
ebbing
tide
i
shall
be
less
than
spindrift
less
than
shells
and
yet
i
shall
be
greater
than
the
gods
for
destiny
no
more
can
bow
my
soul
as
rain
bows
down
the
on

hills
yes
if
my
soul
escape
it
shall
aspire
to
the
white
heaven
as
flame
that
has
its
will
i
go
not
bitterly
not
dumb
with
pain
not
broken
by
the
ache
of
love
i
go
as
one
grown
tired
lies
down
and
hopes
to
sleep
yet
they
shall
say
it
was
for
cercolas
she
died
because
she
could
not
bear
her
love
they
shall
remember
how
we
used
to
walk
here
on
the
cliff
beneath
the
oleanders
in
the
long
limpid
twilight
of
the
spring
looking
toward
lemnos
where
the
amber
sky
was
pierced
with
the
faint
arrow
of
a
star
how
should
they
know
the
wind
of
a
new
beauty
sweeping
my
soul
had
winnowed
it
with
song
i
have
been
glad
tho
love
should
come
or
go
happy
as
trees
that
find
a
wind
to
sway
them
happy
again
when
it
has
left
them
rest
others
shall
say
grave
dica
wrought
her
death
she
would
not
lift
her
lips
to
take
a
kiss
or
ever
lift
her
eyes
to
take
a
smile
she
was
a
pool
the
winter
paves
with
ice
that
the
wild
hunter
in
the
hills
must
leave
with
thirst
unslaked
in
the
brief
southward
sun
ah
dica
it
is
not
for
thee
i
go
and
not
for
phaon
tho
his
ship
lifts
sail
here
in
the
windless
harbor
for
the
south
oh
darkling
deities
that
guard
the
nile
watch
over
one
whose
gods
are
far
away
egypt
be
kind
to
him
his
eyes
are
deep
yet
they
are
wrong
who
say
it
was
for
him
how
should
they
know
that
sappho
lived
and
died
faithful
to
love
not
faithful
to
the
lover
never
transfused
and
lost
in
what
she
loved
never
so
wholly
loving
nor
at
peace
i
asked
for
something
greater
than
i
found
and
every
time
that
love
has
made
me
weep
i
have
rejoiced
that
love
could
be
so
strong
for
i
have
stood
apart
and
watched
my
soul
caught
in
the
gust
of
passion
as
a
bird
with
baffled
wings
against
the
dusty
whirlwind
struggles
and
frees
itself
to
find
the
sky
it
is
not
for
a
single
god
i
go
i
have
grown
weary
of
the
winds
of
heaven
i
will
not
be
a
reed
to
hold
the
sound
of
whatsoever
breath
the
gods
may
blow
turning
my
torment
into
music
for
them
they
gave
me
life
the
gift
was
bountiful
i
lived
with
the
swift
singing
strength
of
fire
seeking
for
beauty
as
a
flame
for
fuel
beauty
in
all
things
and
in
every
hour
the
gods
have
given
life
i
gave
them
song
the
debt
is
paid
and
now
i
turn
to
go
the
breath
of
dawn
blows
the
stars
out
like
lamps
there
is
a
rim
of
silver
on
the
sea
as
one
grown
tired
who
hopes
to
sleep
i
go
ii
oh
litis
little
slave
why
will
you
sleep
these
long
egyptian
noons
bend
down
your
head
bowed
like
the
yarrow
with
a
yellow
bee
there
lift
your
eyes
no
man
has
ever
kindled
dark
eyes
that
wait
like
faggots
for
the
fire
see
how
the
temple
solid
square
of
shade
points
north
to
lesbos
and
the
splendid
sea
that
you
have
never
seen
oh
yet
have
you
never
wondered
what
the
nile
is
seeking
always
restless
and
wild
with
spring
and
no
less
in
the
winter
seeking
still
how
shall
i
tell
you
can
you
think
of
fields
greater
than
gods
could
till
more
blue
than
night
sown
over
with
the
stars
and
delicate
with
filmy
nets
of
foam
that
come
and
go
it
is
more
cruel
and
more
compassionate
than
harried
earth
it
takes
with
unconcern
and
quick
forgetting
rapture
of
the
rain
and
agony
of
thunder
the
moon
white
virginity
and
then
the
insatiable
ardor
of
the
sun
and
me
it
took
but
there
is
one
more
strong
love
that
came
laughing
from
the
elder
seas
the
cyprian
the
mother
of
the
world
she
gave
me
love
who
only
asked
for
death
i
who
had
seen
much
sorrow
in
men
eyes
and
in
my
own
too
sorrowful
a
fire
i
was
a
sister
of
the
stars
and
yet
shaken
with
pain
sister
of
birds
and
yet
the
wings
that
bore
my
soul
were
very
tired
i
watched
the
careless
spring
too
many
times
light
her
green
torches
in
a
hungry
wind
too
many
times
i
watched
them
flare
and
then
fall
to
forsaken
embers
in
the
autumn
and
i
was
sick
of
all
things
even
song
in
the
dull
autumn
dawn
i
turned
to
death
buried
my
living
body
in
the
sea
the
strong
cold
sea
that
takes
and
does
not
give
but
there
is
one
more
strong
the
cyprian
litis
to
wake
from
sleep
and
find
your
eyes
met
in
their
first
fresh
upward
gaze
by
love
filled
with
love
happy
shame
from
other
eyes
dazzled
with
tenderness
and
drowned
in
light
as
tho
you
looked
unthinking
at
the
sun
oh
litis
that
is
joy
but
if
you
came
not
from
the
sunny
shallow
pool
of
sleep
but
from
the
sea
of
death
the
strangling
sea
of
night
and
nothingness
and
waked
to
find
love
looking
down
upon
you
glad
and
still
strange
and
yet
known
forever
that
is
peace
so
did
he
lean
above
me
not
a
word
he
spoke
i
only
heard
the
morning
sea
singing
against
his
happy
ship
the
keen
and
straining
joy
of
sails
and
songs
of
mariners
and
in
myself
the
precious
pain
of
arms
that
held
me
fast
they
warmed
the
cold
sea
out
of
all
my
blood
i
slept
feeling
his
eyes
above
my
sleep
there
on
the
ship
with
wines
and
olives
laden
led
by
the
stars
to
far
invisible
ports
egypt
and
islands
of
the
inner
seas
love
came
to
me
and
cercolas
was
love
iii
from
helen
of
troy
and
other
poems
the
twilight
inner
flame
grows
blue
and
deep
and
in
my
lesbos
over
leagues
of
sea
the
temples
glimmer
in
the
trees
twilight
has
veiled
the
little
here
on
my
heart
but
still
the
night
is
kind
and
leaves
her
warm
sweet
weight
against
my
breast
am
i
that
sappho
who
would
run
at
dusk
along
the
surges
creeping
up
the
shore
when
tides
came
in
to
ease
the
hungry
beach
and
running
running
till
the
night
was
black
would
fall
forespent
upon
the
chilly
sand
and
quiver
with
the
winds
from
off
the
sea
ah
quietly
the
shingle
waits
the
tides
whose
waves
are
stinging
kisses
but
to
me
love
brought
no
peace
nor
darkness
any
rest
i
crept
and
touched
the
foam
with
fevered
hands
and
cried
to
love
from
whom
the
sea
is
sweet
from
whom
the
sea
is
bitterer
than
death
ah
aphrodite
if
i
sing
no
more
to
thee
god
daughter
powerful
as
god
it
is
that
thou
hast
made
my
life
too
sweet
to
hold
the
added
sweetness
of
a
song
there
is
a
quiet
at
the
heart
of
love
and
i
have
pierced
the
pain
and
come
to
peace
i
hold
my
peace
my
cle
iuml
s
on
my
heart
and
softer
than
a
little
wild
bird
wing
are
kisses
that
she
pours
upon
my
mouth
ah
never
any
more
when
spring
like
fire
will
flicker
in
the
newly
opened
leaves
shall
i
steal
forth
to
seek
for
solitude
beyond
the
lure
of
light
alcaeus
lyre
beyond
the
sob
that
stilled
erinna
voice
ah
never
with
a
throat
that
aches
with
song
beneath
the
white
uncaring
sky
of
spring
shall
i
go
forth
to
hide
awhile
from
love
the
quiver
and
the
crying
of
my
heart
still
i
remember
how
i
strove
to
flee
the
of
the
birds
and
bowed
my
head
to
hurry
faster
but
upon
the
ground
i
saw
two
wing
egrave
d
shadows
side
by
side
and
all
the
world
spring
passion
stifled
me
ah
love
there
is
no
fleeing
from
thy
might
no
lonely
place
where
thou
hast
never
trod
no
desert
thou
hast
left
uncarpeted
with
flowers
that
spring
beneath
thy
perfect
feet
in
many
guises
didst
thou
come
to
me
i
saw
thee
by
the
maidens
while
they
danced
phaon
allured
me
with
a
look
of
thine
in
anactoria
i
knew
thy
grace
i
looked
at
cercolas
and
saw
thine
eyes
but
never
wholly
soul
and
body
mine
didst
thou
bid
any
love
me
as
i
loved
now
have
i
found
the
peace
that
fled
from
me
close
close
against
my
heart
i
hold
my
world
ah
love
that
made
my
life
a
iyric
cry
ah
love
that
tuned
my
lips
to
iyres
of
thine
i
taught
the
world
thy
music
now
alone
i
sing
for
one
who
falls
asleep
to
hear
