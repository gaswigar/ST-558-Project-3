the
flood
by
emile
zola
i
my
name
is
louis
roubien
i
am
seventy
years
old
i
was
born
in
the
village
of
several
miles
up
the
garonne
from
toulouse
for
fourteen
years
i
battled
with
the
earth
for
my
daily
bread
at
last
prosperity
smiled
on
we
and
last
month
i
was
still
the
richest
farmer
in
the
parish
our
house
seemed
blessed
happiness
reigned
there
the
sun
was
our
brother
and
i
can
not
recall
a
bad
crop
we
were
almost
a
dozen
on
the
farm
there
was
myself
still
hale
and
hearty
leading
the
children
to
work
then
my
young
brother
pierre
an
old
bachelor
and
retired
sergeant
then
my
sister
agathe
who
came
to
us
after
the
death
of
her
husband
she
was
a
commanding
woman
enormous
and
gay
whose
laugh
could
be
heard
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
then
came
all
the
brood
my
son
jacques
his
wife
rosie
and
their
three
daughters
aimee
veronique
and
marie
the
first
named
was
married
to
cyprica
bouisson
a
big
jolly
fellow
by
whom
she
had
two
children
one
two
years
old
and
the
other
ten
months
veronique
was
just
betrothed
and
was
soon
to
marry
gaspard
rabuteau
the
third
marie
was
a
real
young
lady
so
white
so
fair
that
she
looked
as
if
born
in
the
city
that
made
ten
counting
everybody
i
was
a
grandfather
and
a
when
we
were
at
table
i
had
my
sister
agathe
at
my
right
and
my
brother
pierre
at
my
left
the
children
formed
a
circle
seated
according
to
age
with
the
heads
diminishing
down
to
the
baby
of
ten
months
who
already
ate
his
soup
like
a
man
and
let
me
tell
you
that
the
spoons
in
the
plates
made
a
clatter
the
brood
had
hearty
appetites
and
what
gayety
between
the
mouthfuls
i
was
filled
with
pride
and
joy
when
the
little
ones
held
out
their
hands
toward
me
crying
grandpa
give
us
some
bread
a
big
piece
grandpa
oh
the
good
days
our
farm
sang
from
every
corner
in
the
evening
pierre
invented
games
and
related
stories
of
his
regiment
on
sunday
agathe
made
cakes
for
the
girls
marie
knew
some
canticles
which
she
sang
like
a
chorister
she
looked
like
a
saint
with
her
blond
hair
falling
on
her
neck
and
her
hands
folded
on
her
apron
i
had
built
another
story
on
the
house
when
aimee
had
married
cyprien
and
i
said
laughingly
that
i
would
have
to
build
another
after
the
wedding
of
veronique
and
gaspard
we
never
cared
to
leave
each
other
we
would
sooner
have
built
a
city
behind
the
farm
in
our
enclosure
when
families
are
united
it
is
so
good
to
live
and
die
where
one
has
grown
up
the
month
of
may
had
been
magnificent
that
year
it
was
long
since
the
crops
gave
such
good
promise
that
day
precisely
i
had
made
a
tour
of
inspection
with
my
son
jacques
we
started
at
about
three
o
clock
our
meadows
on
the
banks
of
the
garonne
were
of
a
tender
green
the
grass
was
three
feet
high
and
an
osier
thicket
planted
the
year
before
had
sprouts
a
yard
high
from
there
we
went
to
visit
our
wheat
and
our
vines
fields
bought
one
by
one
as
fortune
came
to
us
the
wheat
was
growing
strong
the
vines
in
full
flower
promised
a
superb
vintage
and
jacques
laughed
his
good
laugh
as
he
slapped
me
on
the
shoulder
well
father
we
shall
never
want
for
bread
nor
for
wine
you
must
be
a
friend
of
the
divine
power
to
have
silver
showered
upon
your
land
in
this
we
often
joked
among
ourselves
of
our
past
poverty
jacques
was
right
i
must
have
gained
the
friendship
of
some
saint
or
of
god
himself
for
all
the
luck
in
the
country
was
for
us
when
it
hailed
the
hail
ceased
on
the
border
of
our
fields
if
the
vines
of
our
neighbors
fell
sick
ours
seemed
to
have
a
wall
of
protection
around
them
and
in
the
end
i
grew
to
consider
it
only
just
never
doing
harm
to
any
one
i
thought
that
happiness
was
my
due
as
we
approached
the
house
rose
gesticulated
calling
out
hurry
up
one
of
our
cows
had
just
had
a
calf
and
everybody
was
excited
the
birth
of
that
little
beast
seemed
one
more
blessing
we
had
been
obliged
recently
to
enlarge
the
stables
where
we
had
nearly
one
hundred
head
of
animals
cows
and
sheep
without
counting
the
horses
well
a
good
day
s
work
i
cried
we
will
drink
a
bottle
of
ripened
meanwhile
rose
took
us
aside
and
told
us
that
gaspard
veronique
s
betrothed
had
come
to
arrange
the
day
for
the
wedding
she
had
invited
him
to
remain
for
dinner
gaspard
the
oldest
son
of
a
farmer
of
moranges
was
a
big
boy
of
twenty
years
known
throughout
the
country
for
his
prodigious
strength
during
a
festival
at
toulouse
he
had
vanquished
martial
the
lion
of
the
with
that
a
nice
boy
with
a
heart
of
gold
he
was
even
timid
and
he
blushed
when
veronique
looked
him
squarely
in
the
face
i
told
rose
to
call
him
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
yard
helping
our
servants
to
spread
out
the
linen
when
he
entered
the
dining
room
where
we
were
jacques
turned
toward
me
saying
you
speak
well
i
said
you
have
come
my
boy
to
have
us
set
the
great
day
yes
that
is
it
father
roubien
he
answered
very
red
you
mustn
t
blush
my
boy
i
continued
it
will
be
if
you
wish
on
day
the
of
july
this
is
the
of
june
so
you
will
have
only
twenty
days
to
wait
my
poor
dead
wife
was
called
felicite
and
that
will
bring
you
happiness
well
is
it
understood
yes
that
will
do
day
father
and
he
gave
each
of
us
a
grip
that
made
us
wince
then
he
embraced
rose
calling
her
mother
this
big
boy
with
the
terrific
fists
loved
veronique
to
the
point
of
losing
his
appetite
now
i
continued
you
must
remain
for
dinner
well
everybody
to
the
table
i
have
a
thundering
appetite
i
that
evening
we
were
eleven
at
table
gaspard
was
placed
next
to
veronique
and
he
sat
looking
at
her
forgetting
his
plate
so
moved
at
the
thought
of
her
belonging
to
him
that
at
times
the
tears
sprang
to
his
eyes
cyprien
and
aimee
married
only
three
years
smiled
jacques
and
rose
who
had
had
years
of
married
life
were
more
serious
but
surreptitiously
they
exchanged
tender
glances
as
for
me
i
seemed
to
relive
in
those
two
sweethearts
whose
happiness
seemed
to
bring
a
corner
of
paradise
to
our
table
what
good
soup
we
had
that
evening
aunt
agathe
always
ready
with
a
witticism
risked
several
jokes
then
that
honest
pierre
wanted
to
relate
his
love
affair
with
a
young
lady
of
lyons
fortunately
we
were
at
the
dessert
and
every
one
was
talking
at
once
i
had
brought
two
bottles
of
mellowed
wine
from
the
cellar
we
drank
to
the
good
fortune
of
gaspard
and
veronique
then
we
had
singing
gaspard
knew
some
love
songs
in
dialect
we
also
asked
marie
for
a
canticle
she
stood
up
and
sang
in
a
voice
that
tickled
one
s
ears
i
went
to
the
window
and
gaspard
joined
me
there
is
there
no
news
up
your
way
i
asked
him
no
he
answered
there
is
considerable
talk
about
the
heavy
rains
of
the
last
few
days
some
seem
to
think
that
they
will
cause
in
effect
it
had
rained
for
sixty
hours
without
stopping
the
garonne
was
very
much
swollen
since
the
preceding
day
but
we
had
confidence
in
it
and
as
long
as
it
did
not
overflow
its
banks
we
could
not
look
on
it
as
a
bad
neighbor
bah
i
exclaimed
shrugging
my
shoulders
nothing
will
happen
it
is
the
same
every
year
the
river
puts
up
her
back
as
if
she
were
furious
and
she
calms
down
in
a
night
you
will
see
my
boy
that
it
will
amount
to
nothing
this
time
see
how
beautiful
the
weather
is
and
i
pointed
to
the
sky
it
was
seven
o
clock
the
sun
was
setting
the
sky
was
blue
an
immense
blue
sheet
of
profound
purity
in
which
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
were
like
a
golden
dust
never
had
i
seen
the
village
drowsing
in
so
sweet
a
peace
upon
the
tiled
roofs
a
rosy
tint
was
fading
i
heard
a
neighbor
s
laugh
then
the
voices
of
children
at
the
turn
in
the
road
in
front
of
our
place
farther
away
and
softened
by
the
distance
rose
the
sounds
of
flocks
entering
their
sheds
the
great
voice
of
the
garonne
roared
continually
but
it
was
to
me
as
the
voice
of
the
silence
so
accustomed
to
it
was
i
little
by
little
the
sky
paled
the
village
became
more
drowsy
it
was
the
evening
of
a
beautiful
day
and
i
thought
that
all
our
good
fortune
the
big
harvests
the
happy
house
the
betrothal
of
veronique
came
to
us
from
above
in
the
purity
of
the
dying
light
a
benediction
spread
over
us
with
the
farewell
of
the
evening
meanwhile
i
had
returned
to
the
center
of
the
room
the
girls
were
chattering
we
listened
to
them
smiling
suddenly
across
the
serenity
of
the
country
a
terrible
cry
sounded
a
cry
of
distress
and
death
the
garonne
the
garonne
ii
we
rushed
out
into
the
yard
is
situated
at
the
bottom
of
a
slope
at
about
five
hundred
yards
from
the
garonne
screens
of
tall
poplars
that
divide
the
meadows
hide
the
river
completely
we
could
see
nothing
and
still
the
cry
rang
out
the
garonne
the
garonne
suddenly
on
the
wide
road
before
us
appeared
two
men
and
three
women
one
of
them
holding
a
child
in
her
arms
it
was
they
who
were
crying
out
distracted
running
with
long
strides
they
turned
at
times
looking
behind
with
terrified
faces
as
if
a
band
of
wolves
was
pursuing
them
what
s
the
matter
with
them
demanded
cyprien
do
you
see
anything
grandfather
no
i
answered
the
leaves
are
not
even
i
was
still
talking
when
an
exclamation
burst
from
us
behind
the
fugitives
there
appeared
between
the
trunks
of
the
poplars
amongst
the
large
tufts
of
grass
what
looked
like
a
pack
of
gray
beasts
speckled
with
yellow
they
sprang
up
from
all
directions
waves
crowding
waves
a
of
masses
of
foaming
water
shaking
the
sod
with
the
rumbling
gallop
of
their
hordes
it
was
our
turn
to
send
forth
the
despairing
cry
the
garonne
the
garonne
the
two
men
and
the
three
women
were
still
running
on
the
road
they
heard
the
terrible
gallop
gaining
on
them
now
the
waves
arrived
in
a
single
line
rolling
tumbling
with
the
thunder
of
a
charging
battalion
with
their
first
shock
they
had
broken
three
poplars
the
tall
foliage
sank
and
disappeared
a
wooden
cabin
was
swallowed
up
a
wall
was
demolished
heavy
carts
were
carried
away
like
straws
but
the
water
seemed
above
all
to
pursue
the
fugitives
at
the
bend
in
the
road
where
there
was
a
steep
slope
it
fell
suddenly
in
an
immense
sheet
and
cut
off
retreat
they
continued
to
run
nevertheless
splashing
through
the
water
no
longer
shouting
mad
with
terror
the
water
swirled
about
their
knees
an
enormous
wave
felled
the
woman
who
was
carrying
the
child
then
all
were
engulfed
quick
quick
i
cried
we
must
get
into
the
house
it
is
solid
we
have
nothing
to
we
took
refuge
upstairs
the
house
was
built
on
a
hillock
above
the
road
the
water
invaded
the
yard
softly
with
a
little
rippling
noise
we
were
not
much
frightened
bah
said
jacques
to
reassure
every
one
this
will
not
amount
to
anything
you
remember
father
in
the
water
came
up
into
the
yard
it
was
a
foot
deep
then
it
it
is
disastrous
for
the
crops
just
the
same
murmured
cyprien
no
it
will
not
be
anything
i
said
seeing
the
large
questioning
eyes
of
our
girls
aimee
had
put
her
two
children
into
the
bed
she
sat
beside
them
with
veronique
and
marie
aunt
agathe
spoke
of
heating
some
wine
she
had
brought
up
to
give
us
courage
jacques
and
rose
were
looking
out
of
a
window
i
was
at
the
other
with
my
brother
pierre
cyprien
and
gaspard
come
up
i
cried
to
our
two
servants
who
were
wading
in
the
yard
don
t
stay
there
and
get
all
but
the
animals
they
asked
they
are
afraid
they
are
killing
each
other
in
the
no
no
come
up
after
a
while
we
ll
see
to
the
rescue
of
the
animals
would
be
impossible
if
the
disaster
was
to
attain
greater
proportions
i
thought
it
unnecessary
to
frighten
the
family
so
i
forced
myself
to
appear
hopeful
leaning
on
the
windowsill
i
indicated
the
progress
of
the
flood
the
river
after
its
attack
on
the
village
was
in
possession
even
to
the
narrowest
streets
it
was
no
longer
a
galloping
charge
but
a
slow
and
invincible
strangulation
the
hollow
in
the
bottom
of
which
is
built
was
changed
into
a
lake
in
our
yard
the
water
was
soon
three
feet
deep
but
i
asserted
that
it
remained
stationary
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
pretend
that
it
was
going
down
well
you
will
be
obliged
to
sleep
here
my
boy
i
said
turning
to
gaspard
that
is
unless
the
roads
are
free
in
a
couple
of
hours
which
is
quite
he
looked
at
me
without
answering
his
face
quite
pale
and
i
saw
him
look
at
veronique
with
an
expression
of
anguish
it
was
eight
o
clock
it
was
still
daylight
a
pale
sad
light
beneath
the
blanched
sky
the
servants
had
had
the
forethought
to
bring
up
two
lamps
with
them
i
had
them
lighted
thinking
that
they
would
brighten
up
the
somber
room
aunt
agathe
who
had
rolled
a
table
to
the
middle
of
the
room
wished
to
organize
a
card
party
the
worthy
woman
whose
eyes
sought
mine
momentarily
thought
above
all
of
diverting
the
children
her
good
humor
kept
up
a
superb
bravery
and
she
laughed
to
combat
the
terror
that
she
felt
growing
around
her
she
forcibly
placed
aimee
veronique
and
marie
at
the
table
she
put
the
cards
into
their
hands
took
a
hand
herself
with
an
air
of
intense
interest
shuffling
cutting
dealing
with
such
a
flow
of
talk
that
she
almost
drowned
the
noise
of
the
water
but
our
girls
could
not
be
diverted
they
were
pale
with
feverish
hands
and
ears
on
the
alert
every
few
moments
there
was
a
pause
in
the
play
one
of
them
would
turn
to
me
asking
in
a
low
voice
grandpa
is
it
still
rising
no
no
go
on
with
the
game
there
is
no
never
had
my
heart
been
gripped
by
such
agony
all
the
men
placed
themselves
at
the
windows
to
hide
the
terrifying
sight
we
tried
to
smile
turned
toward
the
peaceful
lamps
that
threw
discs
of
light
upon
the
table
i
recalled
our
winter
evenings
when
we
gathered
around
the
table
it
was
the
same
quiet
interior
filled
with
the
warmth
of
affection
and
while
peace
was
there
i
heard
behind
me
the
roaring
of
the
escaped
river
that
was
constantly
rising
louis
said
my
brother
pierre
the
water
is
within
three
feet
of
the
window
we
ought
to
tell
i
hushed
him
up
by
pressing
his
arm
but
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
hide
the
peril
in
our
barns
the
animals
were
killing
each
other
there
were
bleatings
and
bellowings
from
the
crazed
herds
and
the
horses
gave
the
harsh
cries
that
can
be
heard
at
great
distances
when
they
are
in
danger
of
death
my
god
my
god
cried
aimee
who
stood
up
pressing
her
hands
to
her
temples
they
all
ran
to
the
windows
there
they
remained
mute
their
hair
rising
with
fear
a
dim
light
floated
above
the
yellow
sheet
of
water
the
pale
sky
looked
like
a
white
cloth
thrown
over
the
earth
in
the
distance
trailed
some
smoke
everything
was
misty
it
was
the
terrified
end
of
a
day
melting
into
a
night
of
death
and
not
a
human
sound
nothing
but
the
roaring
of
that
sea
stretching
to
infinity
nothing
but
the
bellowings
and
the
neighings
of
the
animals
my
god
my
god
repeated
the
women
in
low
voices
as
if
they
feared
to
speak
aloud
a
terrible
cracking
silenced
the
exclamations
the
maddened
animals
had
burst
open
the
doors
of
the
stables
they
passed
in
the
yellow
flood
rolled
about
carried
away
by
the
current
the
sheep
were
tossed
about
like
dead
leaves
whirling
in
bands
in
the
eddies
the
cows
and
the
horses
struggled
tried
to
walk
and
lost
their
footing
our
big
gray
horse
fought
long
for
life
he
stretched
his
neck
he
reared
snorting
like
a
forge
but
the
enraged
waters
took
him
by
the
crupper
and
we
saw
him
beaten
abandon
himself
then
we
gave
way
for
the
first
time
we
felt
the
need
of
tears
our
hands
stretched
out
to
those
dear
animals
that
were
being
borne
away
we
lamented
giving
vent
to
the
tears
and
the
sobs
that
we
had
suppressed
ah
what
ruin
the
harvests
destroyed
the
cattle
drowned
our
fortunes
changed
in
a
few
hours
god
was
not
just
we
had
done
nothing
against
him
and
he
was
taking
everything
from
us
i
shook
my
fist
at
the
horizon
i
spoke
of
our
walk
that
afternoon
of
our
meadows
our
wheat
and
vines
that
we
had
found
so
full
of
promise
it
was
all
a
lie
then
the
sun
lied
when
he
sank
so
sweet
and
calm
in
the
midst
of
the
evening
s
serenity
the
water
was
still
rising
pierre
who
was
watching
it
cried
louis
we
must
look
out
the
water
is
up
to
the
window
that
warning
snatched
us
from
our
spell
of
despair
i
was
once
more
myself
shrugging
my
shoulders
i
said
money
is
nothing
as
long
as
we
are
all
saved
there
need
be
no
regrets
we
shall
have
to
work
again
that
is
all
yes
yes
you
are
right
father
said
jacques
feverishly
and
we
run
no
danger
the
walls
are
good
and
strong
we
must
get
up
on
the
that
was
the
only
refuge
left
us
the
water
which
had
mounted
the
stairs
step
by
step
was
already
coming
through
the
door
we
rushed
to
the
attic
in
a
group
holding
close
to
each
other
cyprien
had
disappeared
i
called
him
and
i
saw
him
return
from
the
next
room
his
face
working
with
emotion
then
as
i
remarked
the
absence
of
the
servants
for
whom
i
was
waiting
he
gave
me
a
strange
look
then
said
in
a
suppressed
voice
dead
the
corner
of
the
shed
under
their
room
caved
the
poor
girls
must
have
gone
to
fetch
their
savings
from
their
trunks
i
told
him
to
say
nothing
about
it
a
cold
shiver
had
passed
over
me
it
was
death
entering
the
house
when
we
went
up
in
our
turn
we
did
not
even
think
of
putting
out
the
lights
the
cards
remained
spread
upon
the
table
there
was
already
a
foot
of
water
in
the
room
iii
fortunately
the
roof
was
vast
and
sloped
gently
we
reached
it
through
a
window
above
which
was
a
sort
of
platform
it
was
there
that
we
took
refuge
the
women
seated
themselves
the
men
went
over
the
tiles
to
reconnoitre
from
my
post
against
the
dormer
window
through
which
we
had
climbed
i
examined
the
four
points
of
the
horizon
help
can
not
fail
to
arrive
i
said
bravely
the
people
of
saintin
have
boats
they
will
come
this
way
look
over
there
isn
t
that
a
lantern
on
the
water
but
no
one
answered
me
pierre
had
lighted
his
pipe
and
he
was
smoking
so
furiously
that
at
each
puff
he
spit
out
pieces
of
the
stem
jacques
and
cyprien
looked
into
the
distance
with
drawn
faces
while
gaspard
clenching
his
fists
continued
to
walk
about
seeking
an
issue
at
our
feet
the
women
silent
and
shivering
hid
their
faces
to
shut
out
the
sight
yet
rose
raised
her
head
glanced
about
her
and
demanded
and
the
servants
where
are
they
why
aren
t
they
here
i
avoided
answering
she
then
questioned
me
her
eyes
on
mine
where
are
the
servants
i
turned
away
unable
to
lie
i
felt
that
chill
that
had
already
brushed
me
pass
over
our
women
and
our
dear
girls
they
had
understood
marie
burst
into
tears
aimee
wrapped
her
two
children
in
her
skirt
as
if
to
protect
them
veronique
her
face
in
her
hands
did
not
move
aunt
agathe
very
pale
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
mumbled
paters
and
aves
meanwhile
the
spectacle
about
us
became
of
sovereign
grandeur
the
night
retained
the
clearness
of
a
summer
night
there
was
no
moon
but
the
sky
was
sprinkled
with
stars
and
was
of
so
pure
a
blue
that
it
seemed
to
fill
space
with
a
blue
light
and
the
immense
sheet
of
water
expanded
beneath
the
softness
of
the
sky
we
could
no
longer
see
any
land
the
water
is
rising
the
water
is
rising
repeated
my
brother
pierre
still
crunching
the
stem
of
his
pipe
between
his
teeth
the
water
was
within
a
yard
of
the
roof
it
was
losing
its
tranquility
currents
were
being
formed
in
less
than
an
hour
the
water
became
threatening
dashing
against
the
house
bearing
drifting
barrels
pieces
of
wood
clumps
of
weeds
in
the
distance
there
were
attacks
upon
walls
and
we
could
hear
the
resounding
shocks
poplar
trees
fell
houses
crumbled
like
a
cartload
of
stones
emptied
by
the
roadside
jacques
unnerved
by
the
sobs
of
the
women
cried
we
can
t
stay
here
we
must
try
something
father
i
beg
of
you
try
to
do
i
stammered
after
him
yes
yes
let
us
try
to
do
and
we
knew
of
nothing
gaspard
offered
to
take
veronique
on
his
back
and
swim
with
her
to
a
place
of
safety
pierre
suggested
a
raft
cyprien
finally
said
if
we
could
only
reach
the
church
above
the
waters
the
church
remained
standing
with
its
little
square
steeple
we
were
separated
from
it
by
seven
houses
our
farmhouse
the
first
of
the
village
adjoined
a
higher
building
which
in
turn
leaned
against
the
next
perhaps
by
way
of
the
roofs
we
would
be
able
to
reach
the
parsonage
a
number
of
people
must
have
taken
refuge
there
already
for
the
neighboring
roofs
were
vacant
and
we
could
hear
voices
that
surely
came
from
the
steeple
but
what
dangers
must
be
run
to
reach
them
it
is
impossible
said
pierre
the
house
of
the
raimbeaus
is
too
high
we
would
need
i
am
going
to
try
it
said
cyprien
i
will
return
if
the
way
is
impracticable
otherwise
we
will
all
go
and
we
will
have
to
carry
the
i
let
him
go
he
was
right
we
had
to
try
the
impossible
he
had
succeeded
by
the
aid
of
an
iron
hook
fixed
in
a
chimney
in
climbing
to
the
next
house
when
his
wife
aimee
raising
her
head
noticed
that
he
was
no
longer
with
us
she
screamed
where
is
he
i
don
t
want
him
to
leave
me
we
are
together
we
shall
die
together
when
she
saw
him
on
the
top
of
the
house
she
ran
over
the
tiles
still
holding
her
children
and
she
called
out
cyprien
wait
for
me
i
am
going
with
you
i
am
going
to
die
with
she
persisted
he
leaned
over
pleading
with
her
promising
to
come
back
telling
her
that
he
was
going
for
the
rescue
of
all
of
us
but
with
a
wild
air
she
shook
her
head
repeating
i
am
going
with
you
i
am
going
with
you
he
had
to
take
the
children
then
he
helped
her
up
we
could
follow
them
along
the
crest
of
the
house
they
walked
slowly
she
had
taken
the
children
again
and
at
every
step
he
turned
and
supported
her
get
her
to
a
safe
place
and
return
i
shouted
i
saw
him
wave
his
hand
but
the
roaring
of
the
water
prevented
my
hearing
his
answer
soon
we
could
not
see
them
they
had
descended
to
the
roof
of
the
next
house
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
they
appeared
upon
the
third
roof
which
must
have
been
very
steep
for
they
went
on
hands
and
knees
along
the
summit
a
sudden
terror
seized
me
i
put
my
hands
to
my
mouth
and
shouted
come
back
come
back
then
all
of
us
shouted
together
our
voices
stopped
them
for
a
moment
but
they
continued
on
their
way
they
reached
the
angle
formed
by
the
street
upon
which
faced
the
raimbeau
house
a
high
structure
with
a
roof
at
least
ten
feet
above
those
of
the
neighboring
houses
for
a
moment
they
hesitated
then
cyprien
climbed
up
a
chimney
pipe
with
the
agility
of
a
cat
aimee
who
must
have
consented
to
wait
for
him
stood
on
the
tiles
we
saw
her
plainly
black
and
enlarged
against
the
pale
sky
straining
her
children
to
her
bosom
and
it
was
then
that
the
horrifying
trouble
began
the
raimbeau
house
originally
intended
for
a
factory
was
very
flimsily
built
besides
the
facade
was
exposed
to
the
current
in
the
street
i
thought
i
could
see
it
tremble
from
the
attacks
of
the
water
and
with
a
contraction
of
the
throat
i
watched
cyprien
cross
the
roof
suddenly
a
rumbling
was
heard
the
moon
rose
a
round
moon
whose
yellow
face
lighted
up
the
immense
lake
not
a
detail
of
the
catastrophe
was
lost
to
us
the
raimbeau
house
collapsed
we
gave
a
cry
of
terror
as
we
saw
cyprien
disappear
as
the
house
crumbled
we
could
distinguish
nothing
but
a
tempest
a
swirling
of
waves
beneath
the
debris
of
the
roof
then
calm
was
restored
the
surface
became
smooth
and
out
of
the
black
hole
of
the
engulfed
house
projected
the
skeleton
of
its
framework
there
was
a
mass
of
entangled
beams
and
amongst
them
i
seemed
to
see
a
body
moving
something
living
making
superhuman
efforts
he
lives
i
cried
oh
god
be
praised
he
lives
we
laughed
nervously
we
clapped
our
hands
as
if
saved
ourselves
he
is
going
to
raise
himself
up
said
pierre
yes
yes
said
gaspard
he
is
trying
to
seize
the
beam
on
his
but
our
laugh
ceased
we
had
just
realized
the
terrible
situation
in
which
cyprien
was
placed
during
the
fall
of
the
house
his
feet
had
been
caught
between
two
beams
and
he
hung
head
downward
within
a
few
inches
of
the
water
on
the
roof
of
the
next
house
aimee
was
still
standing
holding
her
two
children
a
convulsive
tremor
shook
her
she
did
not
take
her
eyes
from
her
husband
a
few
yards
below
her
and
mad
with
horror
she
emitted
without
cessation
a
lamentable
sound
like
the
howling
of
a
dog
we
can
t
let
him
die
like
that
said
jacques
distracted
we
must
get
down
perhaps
we
could
slide
down
the
beams
and
save
him
remarked
pierre
and
they
started
toward
the
neighboring
roof
when
the
second
house
collapsed
leaving
a
gap
in
the
route
then
a
chill
seized
us
we
mechanically
grasped
each
other
s
hands
wringing
them
cruelly
as
we
watched
the
harrowing
sight
cyprien
had
tried
at
first
to
stiffen
his
body
with
extraordinary
strength
he
had
lifted
himself
above
the
water
holding
his
body
in
an
oblique
position
rut
the
strain
was
too
great
nevertheless
he
struggled
tried
to
reach
some
of
the
beams
felt
around
him
for
something
to
hold
to
then
resigning
himself
he
fell
back
again
hanging
limp
death
was
slow
in
coming
the
water
barely
covered
his
hair
and
it
rose
very
gradually
he
must
have
felt
its
coolness
on
his
brain
a
wave
wet
his
brow
others
closed
his
eyes
slowly
we
saw
his
head
disappear
the
women
at
our
feet
had
buried
their
faces
in
their
clasped
hands
we
ourselves
fell
to
our
knees
our
arms
outstretched
weeping
stammering
supplications
on
the
other
roof
aimee
still
standing
her
children
clasped
to
her
bosom
howled
mournfully
into
the
night
iv
i
know
not
how
long
we
remained
in
a
stupor
after
that
tragedy
when
i
came
to
the
water
had
risen
it
was
now
on
a
level
with
the
tiles
the
roof
was
a
narrow
island
emerging
from
the
immense
sheet
to
the
right
and
the
left
the
houses
must
have
crumbled
we
are
moving
murmured
rose
who
clung
to
the
tiles
and
we
all
experienced
the
effect
of
rolling
as
if
the
roof
had
become
detached
and
turned
into
a
raft
the
swift
currents
seemed
to
be
drifting
us
away
then
when
we
looked
at
the
church
clock
immovable
opposite
us
the
dizziness
ceased
we
found
ourselves
in
the
same
place
in
the
midst
of
the
waves
then
the
water
began
an
attack
until
then
the
stream
had
followed
the
street
but
the
debris
that
encumbered
it
deflected
the
course
and
when
a
drifting
object
a
beam
came
within
reach
of
the
current
it
seized
it
and
directed
it
against
the
house
like
a
soon
ten
a
dozen
beams
were
attacking
us
on
all
sides
the
water
roared
our
feet
were
spattered
with
foam
we
heard
the
dull
moaning
of
the
house
full
of
water
there
were
moments
when
the
attacks
became
frenzied
when
the
beams
battered
fiercely
and
then
we
thought
that
the
end
was
near
that
the
walls
would
open
and
deliver
us
to
the
river
gaspard
had
risked
himself
upon
the
edge
of
the
roof
he
had
seized
a
rafter
and
drawn
it
to
him
we
must
defend
ourselves
he
cried
jacques
on
his
side
had
stopped
a
long
pole
in
its
passage
pierre
helped
him
i
cursed
my
age
that
left
me
without
strength
as
feeble
as
a
child
but
the
defense
was
organized
a
drill
between
three
men
and
a
river
gaspard
holding
his
beam
in
readiness
awaited
the
driftwood
that
the
current
sent
against
us
and
he
stopped
it
a
short
distance
from
the
walls
at
times
the
shock
was
so
rude
that
he
fell
beside
him
jacques
and
pierre
manipulated
the
long
pole
during
nearly
an
hour
that
unending
fight
continued
and
the
water
retained
its
tranquil
obstinacy
invincible
then
jacques
and
pierre
succumbed
prostrated
while
gaspard
in
a
last
violent
thrust
had
his
beam
wrested
from
him
by
the
current
the
combat
was
useless
marie
and
veronique
had
thrown
themselves
into
each
other
s
arms
they
repeated
incessantly
one
phrase
a
phrase
of
terror
that
i
still
hear
ringing
in
my
ears
i
don
t
want
to
die
i
don
t
want
to
die
rose
put
her
arms
about
them
she
tried
to
console
them
to
reassure
them
and
she
herself
trembling
raised
her
face
and
cried
out
in
spite
of
herself
i
don
t
want
to
die
aunt
agathe
alone
said
nothing
she
no
longer
prayed
no
longer
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
bewildered
her
eyes
roamed
about
and
she
tried
to
smile
when
her
glance
met
mine
the
water
was
beating
against
the
tiles
now
there
was
no
hope
of
help
we
still
heard
the
voices
in
the
direction
of
the
church
two
lanterns
had
passed
in
the
distance
and
the
silence
spread
over
the
immense
yellow
sheet
the
people
of
saintin
who
owned
boats
must
have
been
surprised
before
us
gaspard
continued
to
wander
over
the
roof
suddenly
he
called
us
look
he
said
help
me
hold
me
tight
he
had
a
pole
and
he
was
watching
an
enormous
black
object
that
was
gently
drifting
toward
the
house
it
was
the
roof
of
a
shed
made
of
strong
boards
and
that
was
floating
like
a
raft
when
it
was
within
reach
he
stopped
it
with
the
pole
and
as
he
felt
himself
being
carried
off
he
called
to
us
we
held
him
around
the
waist
then
as
the
mass
entered
the
current
it
returned
against
our
roof
so
violently
that
we
were
afraid
of
seeing
it
smashed
into
splinters
gaspard
jumped
upon
it
boldly
he
went
over
it
carefully
to
assure
himself
of
its
solidity
he
laughed
saying
joyously
grandfather
we
are
saved
don
t
cry
any
more
you
women
a
real
boat
look
my
feet
are
dry
and
it
will
easily
carry
all
of
us
still
he
thought
it
well
to
make
it
more
solid
he
caught
some
floating
beams
and
bound
them
to
it
with
a
rope
that
pierre
had
brought
up
for
an
emergency
gaspard
even
fell
into
the
water
but
at
our
screams
he
laughed
he
knew
the
water
well
he
could
swim
three
miles
in
the
garonne
at
a
stretch
getting
up
again
he
shook
himself
crying
come
get
on
it
don
t
lose
any
time
the
women
were
on
their
knees
gaspard
had
to
carry
veronique
and
marie
to
the
middle
of
the
raft
where
he
made
them
sit
down
rose
and
aunt
agathe
slid
down
the
tiles
and
placed
themselves
beside
the
young
girls
at
this
moment
i
looked
toward
the
church
aimee
was
still
in
the
same
place
she
was
leaning
now
against
a
chimney
holding
her
children
up
at
arm
s
length
for
the
water
was
to
her
waist
don
t
grieve
grandfather
said
gaspard
we
will
take
her
off
on
the
pierre
and
jacques
were
already
on
the
raft
so
i
jumped
on
gaspard
was
the
last
one
aboard
he
gave
us
poles
that
he
had
prepared
and
that
were
to
serve
us
as
oars
he
had
a
very
long
one
that
he
used
with
great
skill
we
let
him
do
all
the
commanding
at
an
order
from
him
we
braced
our
poles
against
the
tiles
to
put
out
into
the
stream
but
it
seemed
as
if
the
raft
was
attached
to
the
roof
in
spite
of
all
our
efforts
we
could
not
budge
it
at
each
new
effort
the
current
swung
us
violently
against
the
house
and
it
was
a
dangerous
manoeuvre
for
the
shock
threatened
to
break
up
the
planks
composing
the
raft
so
once
again
we
were
made
to
feel
our
helplessness
we
had
thought
ourselves
saved
and
we
were
still
at
the
mercy
of
the
river
i
even
regretted
that
the
women
were
not
on
the
roof
for
every
minute
i
expected
to
see
them
precipitated
into
the
boiling
torrent
but
when
i
suggested
regaining
our
refuge
they
all
cried
no
no
let
us
try
again
better
die
here
gaspard
no
longer
laughed
we
renewed
our
efforts
bending
to
our
poles
with
redoubled
energy
pierre
then
had
the
idea
to
climb
up
on
the
roof
and
draw
us
by
means
of
a
rope
towards
the
left
he
was
thus
able
to
draw
us
out
of
the
current
then
when
he
again
jumped
upon
the
raft
a
few
thrusts
of
our
poles
sent
us
out
into
the
open
but
gaspard
recalled
the
promise
he
had
made
me
to
stop
for
our
poor
aimee
whose
plaintive
moans
had
never
ceased
for
that
purpose
it
was
necessary
to
cross
the
street
where
the
terrible
current
existed
he
consulted
me
by
a
glance
i
was
completely
upset
never
had
such
a
combat
raged
within
me
we
would
have
to
expose
eight
lives
and
yet
i
had
not
the
strength
to
resist
the
mournful
appeal
yes
yes
i
said
to
gaspard
we
can
not
possibly
go
away
without
her
he
lowered
his
head
without
a
word
and
began
using
his
pole
against
all
the
walls
left
standing
we
passed
the
neighboring
house
but
as
soon
as
we
emerged
into
the
street
a
cry
escaped
us
the
current
which
had
again
seized
us
carried
us
back
against
our
house
we
were
whirled
round
like
a
leaf
so
rapidly
that
our
cry
was
cut
short
by
the
smashing
of
the
raft
against
the
tiles
there
was
a
rending
sound
the
planks
were
loosened
and
wrenched
apart
and
we
were
all
thrown
into
the
water
i
do
not
know
what
happened
then
i
remember
that
when
i
sank
i
saw
aunt
agathe
floating
sustained
by
her
skirts
until
she
went
down
backward
head
first
without
a
struggle
a
sharp
pain
brought
me
to
pierre
was
dragging
me
by
the
hair
along
the
tiles
i
lay
still
stupidly
watching
pierre
had
plunged
in
again
and
in
my
confused
state
i
was
surprised
to
see
gaspard
at
the
spot
where
my
brother
had
disappeared
the
young
man
had
veronique
in
his
arms
when
he
had
placed
her
near
me
he
again
jumped
in
bringing
up
marie
her
face
so
waxy
white
that
i
thought
her
dead
then
he
plunged
again
but
this
time
he
searched
in
vain
pierre
had
joined
him
they
talked
and
gave
each
other
indications
that
i
could
not
hear
as
they
drew
themselves
up
on
the
roof
i
cried
and
aunt
agathe
and
jacques
and
rose
they
shook
their
heads
large
tears
coursed
down
their
cheeks
they
explained
to
me
that
jacques
had
struck
his
head
against
a
beam
and
that
rose
had
been
carried
down
with
her
husband
s
body
to
which
she
clung
aunt
agathe
had
not
reappeared
raising
myself
i
looked
toward
the
roof
where
aimee
stood
the
water
was
rising
constantly
aimee
was
now
silent
i
could
see
her
upstretched
arms
holding
her
children
out
of
the
water
then
they
all
sank
the
water
closed
over
them
beneath
the
drowsy
light
of
the
moon
there
were
only
five
of
us
on
the
roof
now
the
water
left
us
but
a
narrow
band
along
the
ridge
one
of
the
chimneys
had
just
been
carried
away
we
had
to
raise
marie
and
veronique
who
were
still
unconscious
and
support
them
almost
in
a
standing
position
to
prevent
the
waves
washing
over
their
legs
at
last
their
senses
returned
and
our
anguish
increased
upon
seeing
them
wet
shivering
and
crying
miserably
that
they
did
not
wish
to
die
the
end
had
come
the
destroyed
village
was
marked
by
a
few
vestiges
of
walls
alone
the
church
reared
its
steeple
intact
from
whence
came
the
voices
a
murmur
of
human
beings
in
a
refuge
there
were
no
longer
any
sounds
of
falling
houses
like
a
cart
of
stones
suddenly
discharged
it
was
as
if
we
were
abandoned
shipwrecked
a
thousand
miles
from
land
one
moment
we
thought
we
heard
the
dip
of
oars
ah
what
hopeful
music
how
we
all
strained
our
eyes
into
space
we
held
our
breath
but
we
could
see
nothing
the
yellow
sheet
stretched
away
spotted
with
black
shadows
but
none
of
those
shadows
tops
of
trees
remnants
of
walls
moved
driftwood
weeds
empty
barrels
caused
us
false
joy
we
waved
our
handkerchiefs
until
realizing
our
error
we
again
succumbed
to
our
anxiety
ah
i
see
it
cried
gaspard
suddenly
look
over
there
a
large
boat
and
he
pointed
out
a
distant
speck
i
could
see
nothing
neither
could
pierre
but
gaspard
insisted
it
was
a
boat
the
sound
of
oars
became
distinct
at
last
we
saw
it
it
was
proceeding
slowly
and
seemed
to
be
circling
about
us
without
approaching
i
remember
that
we
were
like
mad
we
raised
our
arms
in
our
fury
we
shouted
with
all
our
might
and
we
insulted
the
boat
called
it
cowardly
but
dark
and
silent
it
glided
away
slowly
was
it
really
a
boat
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
when
it
disappeared
it
carried
our
last
hope
we
were
expecting
every
second
to
be
engulfed
with
the
house
it
was
undermined
and
was
probably
supported
by
one
solid
wall
which
in
giving
way
would
pull
everything
with
it
but
what
terrified
me
most
was
to
feel
the
roof
sway
under
our
feet
the
house
would
perhaps
hold
out
overnight
but
the
tiles
were
sinking
in
beaten
and
pierced
by
beams
we
had
taken
refuge
on
the
left
side
on
some
solid
rafters
then
these
rafters
seemed
to
weaken
certainly
they
would
sink
if
all
five
of
us
remained
in
so
small
a
space
for
some
minutes
my
brother
pierre
had
been
twisting
his
soldierly
mustache
frowning
and
muttering
to
himself
the
growing
danger
that
surrounded
him
and
against
which
his
courage
availed
nothing
was
wearing
out
his
endurance
he
spat
two
or
three
times
into
the
water
with
an
expression
of
contemptuous
anger
then
as
we
sank
lower
he
made
up
his
mind
he
started
down
the
roof
pierre
pierre
i
cried
fearing
to
comprehend
he
turned
and
said
quietly
adieu
louis
you
see
it
is
too
long
for
me
and
it
will
leave
more
room
for
and
first
throwing
in
his
pipe
he
plunged
adding
good
night
i
have
had
enough
he
did
not
come
up
he
was
not
a
strong
swimmer
and
he
probably
abandoned
himself
at
the
death
of
our
dear
ones
and
at
our
ruin
two
o
clock
sounded
from
the
steeple
of
the
church
the
night
would
soon
end
that
horrible
night
already
so
filled
with
agony
and
tears
little
by
little
beneath
our
feet
the
small
dry
space
grew
smaller
the
current
had
changed
again
the
drift
passed
to
the
right
of
the
village
floating
slowly
as
if
the
water
nearing
its
highest
level
was
reposing
tired
and
lazy
gaspard
suddenly
took
off
his
shoes
and
his
shirt
i
watched
him
for
a
moment
as
he
wrung
his
hands
when
i
questioned
him
he
said
listen
grandfather
it
is
killing
me
to
wait
i
can
not
stay
here
let
me
do
as
i
wish
i
will
save
he
was
speaking
of
veronique
i
opposed
him
he
would
never
have
the
strength
to
carry
the
young
girl
to
the
church
but
he
was
obstinate
yes
i
can
my
arms
are
strong
i
feel
myself
able
you
will
see
i
love
her
i
will
save
her
i
was
silent
i
drew
marie
to
my
breast
then
he
thought
i
was
reproaching
the
selfishness
of
his
love
he
stammered
i
will
return
and
get
marie
i
swear
it
i
will
find
a
boat
and
organize
a
rescue
party
have
confidence
in
me
grandfather
rapidly
he
explained
to
veronique
that
she
must
not
struggle
that
she
must
submit
without
a
movement
and
that
she
must
not
be
afraid
the
young
girl
answered
yes
to
everything
with
a
distracted
look
then
after
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
he
slid
down
the
roof
holding
veronique
by
a
rope
that
he
had
looped
under
her
arms
she
gave
a
scream
beat
the
water
with
arms
and
legs
and
suffocated
she
fainted
i
like
this
better
gaspard
called
to
me
now
i
can
answer
for
her
it
can
be
imagined
with
what
agony
i
followed
them
with
my
eyes
on
the
white
surface
i
could
see
gaspard
s
slightest
movement
he
held
the
young
girl
by
means
of
the
rope
that
he
coiled
around
his
neck
and
he
carried
her
thus
half
thrown
over
his
right
shoulder
the
crushing
weight
bore
him
under
at
times
but
he
advanced
swimming
with
superhuman
strength
i
was
no
longer
in
doubt
he
had
traversed
a
third
of
the
distance
when
he
struck
against
something
submerged
the
shock
was
terrible
both
disappeared
then
i
saw
him
reappear
alone
the
rope
must
have
snapped
he
plunged
twice
at
last
he
came
up
with
veronique
whom
he
again
took
on
his
back
but
without
the
rope
to
hold
her
she
weighed
him
down
more
than
ever
still
he
advanced
a
tremor
shook
me
as
i
saw
them
approaching
the
church
suddenly
i
saw
some
beams
bearing
down
upon
them
a
second
shock
separated
them
and
the
waters
closed
over
them
from
this
moment
i
was
stupefied
i
had
but
the
instinct
of
the
animal
looking
out
for
its
own
safety
when
the
water
advanced
i
retreated
in
that
stupor
i
heard
someone
laughing
without
explaining
to
myself
who
it
was
the
dawn
appeared
a
great
white
daybreak
it
was
very
fresh
and
very
calm
as
on
the
bank
of
a
pond
the
surface
of
which
awakens
before
sunrise
but
the
laughter
sounded
continually
turning
i
saw
marie
standing
in
her
wet
clothes
it
was
she
who
was
laughing
ah
the
poor
dear
child
how
sweet
and
pretty
she
was
at
that
early
hour
i
saw
her
stoop
take
up
some
water
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
and
wash
her
face
then
she
coiled
her
beautiful
blonde
hair
doubtless
she
imagined
she
was
in
her
little
room
dressing
while
the
church
bell
rang
merrily
and
she
continued
to
laugh
her
childish
laugh
her
eyes
bright
and
her
face
happy
i
too
began
to
laugh
infected
with
her
madness
terror
had
destroyed
her
mind
and
it
was
a
mercy
so
charmed
did
she
appear
with
the
beauty
of
the
morning
i
let
her
hasten
not
understanding
shaking
my
head
tenderly
when
she
considered
herself
ready
to
go
she
sang
one
of
her
canticles
in
her
clear
crystalline
voice
but
interrupting
herself
she
cried
as
if
responding
to
someone
who
had
called
her
i
am
coming
i
am
coming
she
took
up
the
canticle
again
went
down
the
roof
and
entered
the
water
it
covered
her
softly
without
a
ripple
i
had
not
ceased
smiling
i
looked
with
happiness
upon
the
spot
where
she
had
just
disappeared
then
i
remembered
nothing
more
i
was
alone
on
the
roof
the
water
had
risen
a
chimney
was
standing
and
i
must
have
clung
to
it
with
all
my
strength
like
an
animal
that
dreads
death
then
nothing
nothing
a
black
pit
oblivion
vi
why
am
i
still
here
they
tell
me
that
people
from
saintin
came
toward
six
o
clock
with
boats
and
that
they
found
me
lying
on
a
chimney
unconscious
the
water
was
cruel
not
to
have
carried
me
away
to
be
with
those
who
were
dear
to
me
all
the
others
are
gone
the
babes
in
swaddling
clothes
the
girls
to
be
married
the
young
married
couples
the
old
married
couples
and
i
i
live
like
a
useless
weed
coarse
and
dried
rooted
in
the
rock
if
i
had
the
courage
i
would
say
like
pierre
i
have
had
enough
good
night
and
i
would
throw
myself
into
the
garonne
i
have
no
child
my
house
is
destroyed
my
fields
are
devastated
oh
the
evenings
when
we
were
all
at
table
and
the
gaiety
surrounded
me
and
kept
me
young
oh
the
great
days
of
harvest
and
vintage
when
we
all
worked
and
when
we
returned
to
the
house
proud
of
our
wealth
oh
the
handsome
children
and
the
fruitful
vines
the
beautiful
girls
and
the
golden
grain
the
joy
of
my
old
age
the
living
recompense
of
my
entire
life
since
all
that
is
gone
why
should
i
live
there
is
no
consolation
i
do
not
want
help
i
will
give
my
fields
to
the
village
people
who
still
have
their
children
they
will
find
the
courage
to
clear
the
land
of
the
flotsam
and
cultivate
it
anew
when
one
has
no
children
a
corner
is
large
enough
to
die
in
i
had
one
desire
one
only
desire
i
wished
to
recover
the
bodies
of
my
family
to
bury
them
beneath
a
slab
where
i
should
soon
rejoin
them
it
was
said
that
at
toulouse
a
large
number
of
bodies
carried
down
the
stream
had
been
taken
from
the
water
i
decided
to
make
the
trip
what
a
terrible
disaster
nearly
two
thousand
houses
in
ruins
seven
hundred
deaths
all
the
bridges
carried
away
a
whole
district
razed
buried
in
the
mud
atrocious
tragedies
twenty
thousand
wretches
starving
to
death
the
city
in
a
pestilential
condition
mourning
everywhere
the
streets
filled
with
funeral
processions
financial
aid
powerless
to
heal
the
wounds
but
i
walked
through
it
all
without
seeing
anything
i
had
my
ruins
i
had
my
dead
to
crush
me
i
was
told
that
many
of
the
bodies
had
been
buried
in
trenches
in
a
corner
of
the
cemetery
only
they
had
had
the
forethought
to
photograph
the
unidentified
and
it
was
among
these
lamentable
photographs
that
i
found
gaspard
and
veronique
they
had
been
clasped
passionately
in
each
other
s
arms
exchanging
in
death
their
bridal
kiss
it
had
been
necessary
to
break
their
arms
in
order
to
separate
them
but
first
they
had
been
photographed
together
and
they
sleep
together
beneath
the
sod
i
have
nothing
but
them
the
image
of
those
two
handsome
children
bloated
by
the
water
disfigured
retaining
upon
their
livid
faces
the
heroism
of
their
love
i
look
at
them
and
i
weep
