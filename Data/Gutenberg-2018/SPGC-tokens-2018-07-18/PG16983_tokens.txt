the
words
and
deeds
of
mortal
men
as
a
standard
for
the
true
understanding
and
recognition
of
god
and
his
prophets
consider
the
past
how
many
both
high
and
low
have
at
all
times
yearningly
awaited
the
advent
of
the
manifestations
of
god
in
the
sanctified
persons
of
his
chosen
ones
how
often
have
they
expected
his
coming
how
frequently
have
they
prayed
that
the
breeze
of
divine
mercy
might
blow
and
the
promised
beauty
step
forth
from
behind
the
veil
of
concealment
and
be
made
manifest
to
all
the
world
and
whensoever
the
portals
of
grace
did
open
and
the
clouds
of
divine
bounty
did
rain
upon
mankind
and
the
light
of
the
unseen
did
shine
above
the
horizon
of
celestial
might
they
all
denied
him
and
turned
away
from
his
face
of
god
himself
refer
ye
to
verify
this
truth
to
that
which
hath
been
recorded
in
every
sacred
book
ponder
for
a
moment
and
reflect
upon
that
which
hath
been
the
cause
of
such
denial
on
the
part
of
those
who
have
searched
with
such
earnestness
and
longing
their
attack
hath
been
more
fierce
than
tongue
or
pen
can
describe
not
one
single
manifestation
of
holiness
hath
appeared
but
he
was
afflicted
by
the
denials
the
repudiation
and
the
vehement
opposition
of
the
people
around
him
thus
it
hath
been
revealed
o
the
misery
of
men
no
messenger
cometh
unto
them
but
they
laugh
him
to
again
he
saith
each
nation
hath
plotted
darkly
against
their
messenger
to
lay
violent
hold
on
him
and
disputed
with
vain
words
to
invalidate
the
in
like
manner
those
words
that
have
streamed
forth
from
the
source
of
power
and
descended
from
the
heaven
of
glory
are
innumerable
and
beyond
the
ordinary
comprehension
of
man
to
them
that
are
possessed
of
true
understanding
and
insight
the
súrah
of
húd
surely
sufficeth
ponder
a
while
those
holy
words
in
your
heart
and
with
utter
detachment
strive
to
grasp
their
meaning
examine
the
wondrous
behaviour
of
the
prophets
and
recall
the
defamations
and
denials
uttered
by
the
children
of
negation
and
falsehood
perchance
you
may
cause
the
bird
of
the
human
heart
to
wing
its
flight
away
from
the
abodes
of
heedlessness
and
doubt
unto
the
nest
of
faith
and
certainty
and
drink
deep
from
the
pure
waters
of
ancient
wisdom
and
partake
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
divine
knowledge
such
is
the
share
of
the
pure
in
heart
of
the
bread
that
hath
descended
from
the
realms
of
eternity
and
holiness
should
you
acquaint
yourself
with
the
indignities
heaped
upon
the
prophets
of
god
and
apprehend
the
true
causes
of
the
objections
voiced
by
their
oppressors
you
will
surely
appreciate
the
significance
of
their
position
moreover
the
more
closely
you
observe
the
denials
of
those
who
have
opposed
the
manifestations
of
the
divine
attributes
the
firmer
will
be
your
faith
in
the
cause
of
god
accordingly
a
brief
mention
will
be
made
in
this
tablet
of
divers
accounts
relative
to
the
prophets
of
god
that
they
may
demonstrate
the
truth
that
throughout
all
ages
and
centuries
the
manifestations
of
power
and
glory
have
been
subjected
to
such
heinous
cruelties
that
no
pen
dare
describe
them
perchance
this
may
enable
a
few
to
cease
to
be
perturbed
by
the
clamour
and
protestations
of
the
divines
and
the
foolish
of
this
age
and
cause
them
to
strengthen
their
confidence
and
certainty
among
the
prophets
was
noah
for
nine
hundred
and
fifty
years
he
prayerfully
exhorted
his
people
and
summoned
them
to
the
haven
of
security
and
peace
none
however
heeded
his
call
each
day
they
inflicted
on
his
blessed
person
such
pain
and
suffering
that
no
one
believed
he
could
survive
how
frequently
they
denied
him
how
malevolently
they
hinted
their
suspicion
against
him
thus
it
hath
been
revealed
and
as
often
as
a
company
of
his
people
passed
by
him
they
derided
him
to
them
he
said
though
ye
scoff
at
us
now
we
will
scoff
at
you
hereafter
even
as
ye
scoff
at
us
in
the
end
ye
shall
long
afterward
he
several
times
promised
victory
to
his
companions
and
fixed
the
hour
thereof
but
when
the
hour
struck
the
divine
promise
was
not
fulfilled
this
caused
a
few
among
the
small
number
of
his
followers
to
turn
away
from
him
and
to
this
testify
the
records
of
the
books
these
you
must
certainly
have
perused
if
not
undoubtedly
you
will
finally
as
stated
in
books
and
traditions
there
remained
with
him
only
forty
or
of
his
followers
at
last
from
the
depth
of
his
being
he
cried
aloud
lord
leave
not
upon
the
land
a
single
dweller
from
among
the
and
now
consider
and
reflect
a
moment
upon
the
waywardness
of
this
people
what
could
have
been
the
reason
for
such
denial
and
avoidance
on
their
part
what
could
have
induced
them
to
refuse
to
put
off
the
garment
of
denial
and
to
adorn
themselves
with
the
robe
of
acceptance
moreover
what
could
have
caused
the
nonfulfilment
of
the
divine
promise
which
led
the
seekers
to
reject
that
which
they
had
accepted
meditate
profoundly
that
the
secret
of
things
unseen
may
be
revealed
unto
you
that
you
may
inhale
the
sweetness
of
a
spiritual
and
imperishable
fragrance
and
that
you
may
acknowledge
the
truth
that
from
time
immemorial
even
unto
eternity
the
almighty
hath
tried
and
will
continue
to
try
his
servants
so
that
light
may
be
distinguished
from
darkness
truth
from
falsehood
right
from
wrong
guidance
from
error
happiness
from
misery
and
roses
from
thorns
even
as
he
hath
revealed
do
men
think
when
they
say
we
believe
they
shall
be
let
alone
and
not
be
put
to
proof
and
after
noah
the
light
of
the
countenance
of
húd
shone
forth
above
the
horizon
of
creation
for
seven
hundred
years
according
to
the
sayings
of
men
he
exhorted
the
people
to
turn
their
faces
and
draw
nearer
unto
the
ridván
of
the
divine
presence
what
showers
of
afflictions
rained
upon
him
until
at
last
his
adjurations
bore
the
fruit
of
increased
rebelliousness
and
his
assiduous
endeavours
resulted
in
the
wilful
blindness
of
his
people
and
their
unbelief
shall
only
increase
for
the
unbelievers
their
own
and
after
him
there
appeared
from
the
ridván
of
the
eternal
the
invisible
the
holy
person
of
ṣáliḥ
who
again
summoned
the
people
to
the
river
of
everlasting
life
for
over
a
hundred
years
he
admonished
them
to
hold
fast
unto
the
commandments
of
god
and
eschew
that
which
is
forbidden
his
admonitions
however
yielded
no
fruit
and
his
pleading
proved
of
no
avail
several
times
he
retired
and
lived
in
seclusion
all
this
although
that
eternal
beauty
was
summoning
the
people
to
no
other
than
the
city
of
god
even
as
it
is
revealed
and
unto
the
tribe
of
thámúd
we
sent
their
brother
ṣáliḥ
o
my
people
said
he
worship
god
ye
have
none
other
god
beside
him
they
made
reply
o
ṣáliḥ
our
hopes
were
fixed
on
thee
until
now
forbiddest
thou
us
to
worship
that
which
our
fathers
worshipped
truly
we
misdoubt
that
whereunto
thou
callest
us
as
all
this
proved
fruitless
until
at
last
there
went
up
a
great
cry
and
all
fell
into
utter
perdition
later
the
beauty
of
the
countenance
of
the
friend
of
god
appeared
from
behind
the
veil
and
another
standard
of
divine
guidance
was
hoisted
he
invited
the
people
of
the
earth
to
the
light
of
righteousness
the
more
passionately
he
exhorted
them
the
fiercer
waxed
the
envy
and
waywardness
of
the
people
except
those
who
wholly
detached
themselves
from
all
save
god
and
ascended
on
the
wings
of
certainty
to
the
station
which
god
hath
exalted
beyond
the
comprehension
of
men
it
is
well
known
what
a
host
of
enemies
besieged
him
until
at
last
the
fires
of
envy
and
rebellion
were
kindled
against
him
and
after
the
episode
of
the
fire
came
to
pass
he
the
lamp
of
god
amongst
men
was
as
recorded
in
all
books
and
chronicles
expelled
from
his
city
and
when
his
day
was
ended
there
came
the
turn
of
moses
armed
with
the
rod
of
celestial
dominion
adorned
with
the
white
hand
of
divine
knowledge
and
proceeding
from
the
párán
of
the
love
of
god
and
wielding
the
serpent
of
power
and
everlasting
majesty
he
shone
forth
from
the
sinai
of
light
upon
the
world
he
summoned
all
the
peoples
and
kindreds
of
the
earth
to
the
kingdom
of
eternity
and
invited
them
to
partake
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
faithfulness
surely
you
are
aware
of
the
fierce
opposition
of
pharaoh
and
his
people
and
of
the
stones
of
idle
fancy
which
the
hands
of
infidels
cast
upon
that
blessed
tree
so
much
so
that
pharaoh
and
his
people
finally
arose
and
exerted
their
utmost
endeavor
to
extinguish
with
the
waters
of
falsehood
and
denial
the
fire
of
that
sacred
tree
oblivious
of
the
truth
that
no
earthly
water
can
quench
the
flame
of
divine
wisdom
nor
mortal
blasts
extinguish
the
lamp
of
everlasting
dominion
nay
rather
such
water
can
not
but
intensify
the
burning
of
the
flame
and
such
blasts
can
not
but
ensure
the
preservation
of
the
lamp
were
ye
to
observe
with
the
eye
of
discernment
and
walk
in
the
way
of
god
s
holy
will
and
pleasure
how
well
hath
a
believer
of
the
kindred
of
pharaoh
whose
story
is
recounted
by
the
in
his
book
revealed
unto
his
beloved
one
observed
and
a
man
of
the
family
of
pharaoh
who
was
a
believer
and
concealed
his
faith
said
will
ye
slay
a
man
because
he
saith
my
lord
is
god
when
he
hath
already
come
to
you
with
signs
from
your
lord
if
he
be
a
liar
on
him
will
be
his
lie
but
if
he
be
a
man
of
truth
part
of
what
he
threateneth
will
fall
upon
you
in
truth
god
guideth
not
him
who
is
a
transgressor
a
finally
so
great
was
their
iniquity
that
this
believer
was
put
to
a
shameful
death
the
curse
of
god
be
upon
the
people
of
and
now
ponder
upon
these
things
what
could
have
caused
such
contention
and
conflict
why
is
it
that
the
advent
of
every
true
manifestation
of
god
hath
been
accompanied
by
such
strife
and
tumult
by
such
tyranny
and
upheaval
this
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
all
the
prophets
of
god
whenever
made
manifest
unto
the
peoples
of
the
world
have
invariably
foretold
the
coming
of
yet
another
prophet
after
them
and
have
established
such
signs
as
would
herald
the
advent
of
the
future
dispensation
to
this
the
records
of
all
sacred
books
bear
witness
why
then
is
it
that
despite
the
expectation
of
men
in
their
quest
of
the
manifestations
of
holiness
and
in
spite
of
the
signs
recorded
in
the
sacred
books
such
acts
of
violence
of
oppression
and
cruelty
should
have
been
perpetrated
in
every
age
and
cycle
against
all
the
prophets
and
chosen
ones
of
god
even
as
he
hath
revealed
as
oft
as
an
apostle
cometh
unto
you
with
that
which
your
souls
desire
not
ye
swell
with
pride
accusing
some
of
being
impostors
and
slaying
reflect
what
could
have
been
the
motive
for
such
deeds
what
could
have
prompted
such
behaviour
towards
the
revealers
of
the
beauty
of
the
whatever
in
days
gone
by
hath
been
the
cause
of
the
denial
and
opposition
of
those
people
hath
now
led
to
the
perversity
of
the
people
of
this
age
to
maintain
that
the
testimony
of
providence
was
incomplete
that
it
hath
therefore
been
the
cause
of
the
denial
of
the
people
is
but
open
blasphemy
how
far
from
the
grace
of
the
and
from
his
loving
providence
and
tender
mercies
it
is
to
single
out
a
soul
from
amongst
all
men
for
the
guidance
of
his
creatures
and
on
one
hand
to
withhold
from
him
the
full
measure
of
his
divine
testimony
and
on
the
other
inflict
severe
retribution
on
his
people
for
having
turned
away
from
his
chosen
one
nay
the
manifold
bounties
of
the
lord
of
all
beings
have
at
all
times
through
the
manifestations
of
his
divine
essence
encompassed
the
earth
and
all
that
dwell
therein
not
for
a
moment
hath
his
grace
been
withheld
nor
have
the
showers
of
his
ceased
to
rain
upon
mankind
consequently
such
behaviour
can
be
attributed
to
naught
save
the
of
such
souls
as
tread
the
valley
of
arrogance
and
pride
are
lost
in
the
wilds
of
remoteness
walk
in
the
ways
of
their
idle
fancy
and
follow
the
dictates
of
the
leaders
of
their
faith
their
chief
concern
is
mere
opposition
their
sole
desire
is
to
ignore
the
truth
unto
every
discerning
observer
it
is
evident
and
manifest
that
had
these
people
in
the
days
of
each
of
the
manifestations
of
the
sun
of
truth
sanctified
their
eyes
their
ears
and
their
hearts
from
whatever
they
had
seen
heard
and
felt
they
surely
would
not
have
been
deprived
of
beholding
the
beauty
of
god
nor
strayed
far
from
the
habitations
of
glory
but
having
weighed
the
testimony
of
god
by
the
standard
of
their
own
knowledge
gleaned
from
the
teachings
of
the
leaders
of
their
faith
and
found
it
at
variance
with
their
limited
understanding
they
arose
to
perpetrate
such
unseemly
acts
leaders
of
religion
in
every
age
have
hindered
their
people
from
attaining
the
shores
of
eternal
salvation
inasmuch
as
they
held
the
reins
of
authority
in
their
mighty
grasp
some
for
the
lust
of
leadership
others
through
want
of
knowledge
and
understanding
have
been
the
cause
of
the
deprivation
of
the
people
by
their
sanction
and
authority
every
prophet
of
god
hath
drunk
from
the
chalice
of
sacrifice
and
winged
his
flight
unto
the
heights
of
glory
what
unspeakable
cruelties
they
that
have
occupied
the
seats
of
authority
and
learning
have
inflicted
upon
the
true
monarchs
of
the
world
those
gems
of
divine
virtue
content
with
a
transitory
dominion
they
have
deprived
themselves
of
an
everlasting
sovereignty
thus
their
eyes
beheld
not
the
light
of
the
countenance
of
the
nor
did
their
ears
hearken
unto
the
sweet
melodies
of
the
bird
of
desire
for
this
reason
in
all
sacred
books
mention
hath
been
made
of
the
divines
of
every
age
thus
he
saith
o
people
of
the
book
why
disbelieve
the
signs
of
god
to
which
ye
yourselves
have
been
witnesses
and
also
he
saith
o
people
of
the
book
why
clothe
ye
the
truth
with
falsehood
why
wittingly
hide
the
truth
again
he
saith
say
o
people
of
the
book
why
repel
believers
from
the
way
of
god
it
is
evident
that
by
the
people
of
the
book
who
have
repelled
their
from
the
straight
path
of
god
is
meant
none
other
than
the
divines
of
that
age
whose
names
and
character
have
been
revealed
in
the
sacred
books
and
alluded
to
in
the
verses
and
traditions
recorded
therein
were
you
to
observe
with
the
eye
of
god
with
fixed
and
steady
gaze
born
of
the
unerring
eye
of
god
scan
for
a
while
the
horizon
of
divine
knowledge
and
contemplate
those
words
of
perfection
which
the
eternal
hath
revealed
that
haply
the
mysteries
of
divine
wisdom
hidden
ere
now
beneath
the
veil
of
glory
and
treasured
within
the
tabernacle
of
his
grace
may
be
made
manifest
unto
you
the
denials
and
protestations
of
these
leaders
of
religion
have
in
the
main
been
due
to
their
lack
of
knowledge
and
understanding
those
words
uttered
by
the
revealers
of
the
beauty
of
the
one
true
god
setting
forth
the
signs
that
should
herald
the
advent
of
the
manifestation
to
come
they
never
understood
nor
fathomed
hence
they
raised
the
standard
of
revolt
and
stirred
up
mischief
and
sedition
it
is
obvious
and
manifest
that
the
true
meaning
of
the
utterances
of
the
birds
of
eternity
is
revealed
to
none
except
those
that
manifest
the
eternal
being
and
the
melodies
of
the
nightingale
of
holiness
can
reach
no
ear
save
that
of
the
denizens
of
the
everlasting
realm
the
copt
of
tyranny
can
never
partake
of
the
cup
touched
by
the
lips
of
the
sept
of
justice
and
the
pharaoh
of
unbelief
can
never
hope
to
recognize
the
hand
of
the
moses
of
truth
even
as
he
saith
none
knoweth
the
meaning
thereof
except
god
and
them
that
are
in
and
yet
they
have
sought
the
interpretation
of
the
book
from
those
that
are
wrapt
in
veils
and
have
refused
to
seek
enlightenment
from
the
of
knowledge
and
when
the
days
of
moses
were
ended
and
the
light
of
jesus
shining
forth
from
the
dayspring
of
the
spirit
encompassed
the
world
all
the
people
of
israel
arose
in
protest
against
him
they
clamoured
that
he
whose
advent
the
bible
had
foretold
must
needs
promulgate
and
fulfil
the
laws
of
moses
whereas
this
youthful
nazarene
who
laid
claim
to
the
station
of
the
divine
messiah
had
annulled
the
law
of
divorce
and
of
the
sabbath
most
weighty
of
all
the
laws
of
moses
moreover
what
of
the
signs
of
the
manifestation
yet
to
come
these
people
of
israel
are
even
unto
the
present
day
still
expecting
that
manifestation
which
the
bible
hath
foretold
how
many
manifestations
of
holiness
how
many
revealers
of
the
light
everlasting
have
appeared
since
the
time
of
moses
and
yet
israel
wrapt
in
the
densest
veils
of
satanic
fancy
and
false
imaginings
is
still
expectant
that
the
idol
of
her
own
handiwork
will
appear
with
such
signs
as
she
herself
hath
conceived
thus
hath
god
laid
hold
of
them
for
their
sins
hath
extinguished
in
them
the
spirit
of
faith
and
tormented
them
with
the
flames
of
the
nethermost
fire
and
this
for
no
other
reason
except
that
israel
refused
to
apprehend
the
meaning
of
such
words
as
have
been
revealed
in
the
bible
concerning
the
signs
of
the
coming
revelation
as
she
never
grasped
their
true
significance
and
to
outward
seeming
such
events
never
came
to
pass
she
therefore
remained
deprived
of
recognizing
the
beauty
of
jesus
and
of
beholding
the
face
of
god
and
they
still
await
his
coming
from
time
immemorial
even
unto
this
day
all
the
kindreds
and
peoples
of
the
earth
have
clung
to
such
fanciful
and
unseemly
thoughts
and
thus
have
deprived
themselves
of
the
clear
waters
streaming
from
the
springs
of
purity
and
holiness
in
unfolding
these
mysteries
we
have
in
our
former
tablets
which
were
addressed
to
a
friend
in
the
melodious
language
of
ḥijáz
cited
a
few
of
the
verses
revealed
unto
the
prophets
of
old
and
now
responding
to
your
request
we
again
shall
cite
in
these
pages
those
same
verses
uttered
this
time
in
the
wondrous
accents
of
iráq
that
haply
the
sore
athirst
in
the
wilds
of
remoteness
may
attain
unto
the
ocean
of
the
divine
presence
and
they
that
languish
in
the
wastes
of
separation
be
led
unto
the
home
of
eternal
reunion
thus
the
mists
of
error
may
be
dispelled
and
the
light
of
divine
guidance
dawn
forth
above
the
horizon
of
human
hearts
in
god
we
put
our
trust
and
to
him
we
cry
for
help
that
haply
there
may
flow
from
this
pen
that
which
shall
quicken
the
souls
of
men
that
they
may
all
arise
from
their
beds
of
heedlessness
and
hearken
unto
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
of
paradise
from
the
tree
which
the
hand
of
divine
power
hath
by
the
permission
of
god
planted
in
the
ridván
of
the
to
them
that
are
endowed
with
understanding
it
is
clear
and
manifest
that
when
the
fire
of
the
love
of
jesus
consumed
the
veils
of
jewish
limitations
and
his
authority
was
made
apparent
and
partially
enforced
he
the
revealer
of
the
unseen
beauty
addressing
one
day
his
disciples
referred
unto
his
passing
and
kindling
in
their
hearts
the
fire
of
bereavement
said
unto
them
i
go
away
and
come
again
unto
and
in
another
place
he
said
i
go
and
another
will
come
who
will
tell
you
all
that
i
have
not
told
you
and
will
fulfil
all
that
i
have
both
these
sayings
have
but
one
meaning
were
you
to
ponder
upon
the
manifestations
of
the
unity
of
god
with
divine
insight
every
discerning
observer
will
recognize
that
in
the
dispensation
of
the
qur
án
both
the
book
and
the
cause
of
jesus
were
confirmed
as
to
the
matter
of
names
muḥammad
himself
declared
i
am
he
recognized
the
truth
of
the
signs
prophecies
and
words
of
jesus
and
testified
that
they
were
all
of
god
in
this
sense
neither
the
person
of
jesus
nor
his
writings
hath
differed
from
that
of
muḥammad
and
of
his
holy
book
inasmuch
as
both
have
championed
the
cause
of
god
uttered
his
praise
and
revealed
his
commandments
thus
it
is
that
jesus
himself
declared
i
go
away
and
come
again
unto
consider
the
sun
were
it
to
say
now
i
am
the
sun
of
yesterday
it
would
speak
the
truth
and
should
it
bearing
the
sequence
of
time
in
mind
claim
to
be
other
than
that
sun
it
still
would
speak
the
truth
in
like
manner
if
it
be
said
that
all
the
days
are
but
one
and
the
same
it
is
correct
and
true
and
if
it
be
said
with
respect
to
their
particular
names
and
designations
that
they
differ
that
again
is
true
for
though
they
are
the
same
yet
one
doth
recognize
in
each
a
separate
designation
a
specific
attribute
a
particular
character
conceive
accordingly
the
distinction
variation
and
unity
characteristic
of
the
various
manifestations
of
holiness
that
thou
mayest
comprehend
the
allusions
made
by
the
creator
of
all
names
and
attributes
to
the
mysteries
of
distinction
and
unity
and
discover
the
answer
to
thy
question
as
to
why
that
everlasting
beauty
should
have
at
sundry
times
called
himself
by
different
names
and
titles
afterwards
the
companions
and
disciples
of
jesus
asked
him
concerning
those
signs
that
must
needs
signalize
the
return
of
his
manifestation
when
they
asked
shall
these
things
be
several
times
they
questioned
that
peerless
beauty
and
every
time
he
made
reply
he
set
forth
a
special
sign
that
should
herald
the
advent
of
the
promised
dispensation
to
this
testify
the
records
of
the
four
gospels
this
wronged
one
will
cite
but
one
of
these
instances
thus
conferring
upon
mankind
for
the
sake
of
god
such
bounties
as
are
yet
concealed
within
the
treasury
of
the
hidden
and
sacred
tree
that
haply
mortal
men
may
not
remain
deprived
of
their
share
of
the
immortal
fruit
and
attain
to
a
dewdrop
of
the
waters
of
everlasting
life
which
from
baghdád
the
abode
of
peace
are
being
vouchsafed
unto
all
mankind
we
ask
for
neither
meed
nor
reward
we
nourish
your
souls
for
the
sake
of
god
we
seek
from
you
neither
recompense
nor
this
is
the
food
that
conferreth
everlasting
life
upon
the
pure
in
heart
and
the
illumined
in
spirit
this
is
the
bread
of
which
it
is
said
lord
send
down
upon
us
thy
bread
from
this
bread
shall
never
be
withheld
from
them
that
deserve
it
nor
can
it
ever
be
exhausted
it
groweth
everlastingly
from
the
tree
of
grace
it
descendeth
at
all
seasons
from
the
heavens
of
justice
and
mercy
even
as
he
saith
seest
thou
not
to
what
god
likeneth
a
good
word
to
a
good
tree
its
root
firmly
fixed
and
its
branches
reaching
unto
heaven
yielding
its
fruit
in
all
o
the
pity
that
man
should
deprive
himself
of
this
goodly
gift
this
imperishable
bounty
this
everlasting
life
it
behooveth
him
to
prize
this
food
that
cometh
from
heaven
that
perchance
through
the
wondrous
favours
of
the
sun
of
truth
the
dead
may
be
brought
to
life
and
withered
souls
be
quickened
by
the
infinite
spirit
make
haste
o
my
brother
that
while
there
is
yet
time
our
lips
may
taste
of
the
immortal
draught
for
the
breeze
of
life
now
blowing
from
the
city
of
the
can
not
last
and
the
streaming
river
of
holy
utterance
must
needs
be
stilled
and
the
portals
of
the
ridván
can
not
for
ever
remain
open
the
day
will
surely
come
when
the
nightingale
of
paradise
will
have
winged
its
flight
away
from
its
earthly
abode
unto
its
heavenly
nest
then
will
its
melody
be
heard
no
more
and
the
beauty
of
the
rose
cease
to
shine
seize
the
time
therefore
ere
the
glory
of
the
divine
springtime
hath
spent
itself
and
the
bird
of
eternity
ceased
to
warble
its
melody
that
thy
inner
hearing
may
not
be
deprived
of
hearkening
unto
its
call
this
is
my
counsel
unto
thee
and
unto
the
beloved
of
god
whosoever
wisheth
let
him
turn
thereunto
whosoever
wisheth
let
him
turn
away
god
verily
is
independent
of
him
and
of
that
which
he
may
see
and
witness
these
are
the
melodies
sung
by
jesus
son
of
mary
in
accents
of
majestic
power
in
the
ridván
of
the
gospel
revealing
those
signs
that
must
needs
herald
the
advent
of
the
manifestation
after
him
in
the
first
gospel
according
to
matthew
it
is
recorded
and
when
they
asked
jesus
concerning
the
signs
of
his
coming
he
said
unto
them
immediately
after
the
oppression
of
those
days
shall
the
sun
be
darkened
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light
and
the
stars
shall
fall
from
heaven
and
the
powers
of
the
earth
shall
be
shaken
and
then
shall
appear
the
sign
of
the
son
of
man
in
heaven
and
then
shall
all
the
tribes
of
the
earth
mourn
and
they
shall
see
the
son
of
man
coming
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
with
power
and
great
glory
and
he
shall
send
his
angels
with
a
great
sound
of
a
rendered
into
the
persian
tongue
the
purport
of
these
words
is
as
follows
when
the
oppression
and
afflictions
that
are
to
befall
mankind
will
have
come
to
pass
then
shall
the
sun
be
withheld
from
shining
the
moon
from
giving
light
the
stars
of
heaven
shall
fall
upon
the
earth
and
the
pillars
of
the
earth
shall
quake
at
that
time
the
signs
of
the
son
of
man
shall
appear
in
heaven
that
is
the
promised
beauty
and
substance
of
life
shall
when
these
signs
have
appeared
step
forth
out
of
the
realm
of
the
invisible
into
the
visible
world
and
he
saith
at
that
time
all
the
peoples
and
kindreds
that
dwell
on
earth
shall
bewail
and
lament
and
they
shall
see
that
divine
beauty
coming
from
heaven
riding
upon
the
clouds
with
power
grandeur
and
magnificence
sending
his
angels
with
a
great
sound
of
a
trumpet
similarly
in
the
three
other
gospels
according
to
luke
mark
and
john
the
same
statements
are
recorded
as
we
have
referred
at
length
to
these
in
our
tablets
revealed
in
the
arabic
tongue
we
have
made
no
mention
of
them
in
these
pages
and
have
confined
ourselves
to
but
one
reference
inasmuch
as
the
christian
divines
have
failed
to
apprehend
the
meaning
of
these
words
and
did
not
recognize
their
object
and
purpose
and
have
clung
to
the
literal
interpretation
of
the
words
of
jesus
they
therefore
became
deprived
of
the
streaming
grace
of
the
muḥammadan
revelation
and
its
showering
bounties
the
ignorant
among
the
christian
community
following
the
example
of
the
leaders
of
their
faith
were
likewise
prevented
from
beholding
the
beauty
of
the
king
of
glory
inasmuch
as
those
signs
which
were
to
accompany
the
dawn
of
the
sun
of
the
muḥammadan
dispensation
did
not
actually
come
to
pass
thus
ages
have
passed
and
centuries
rolled
away
and
that
most
pure
spirit
hath
repaired
unto
the
retreats
of
its
ancient
sovereignty
once
more
hath
the
eternal
spirit
breathed
into
the
mystic
trumpet
and
caused
the
dead
to
speed
out
of
their
sepulchres
of
heedlessness
and
error
unto
the
realm
of
guidance
and
grace
and
yet
that
expectant
community
still
crieth
out
when
shall
these
things
be
when
shall
the
promised
one
the
object
of
our
expectation
be
made
manifest
that
we
may
arise
for
the
triumph
of
his
cause
that
we
may
sacrifice
our
substance
for
his
sake
that
we
may
offer
up
our
lives
in
his
path
in
like
manner
have
such
false
imaginings
caused
other
communities
to
stray
from
the
kawthar
of
the
infinite
mercy
of
providence
and
to
be
busied
with
their
own
idle
thoughts
beside
this
passage
there
is
yet
another
verse
in
the
gospel
wherein
he
saith
heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
away
but
my
words
shall
not
pass
thus
it
is
that
the
adherents
of
jesus
maintained
that
the
law
of
the
gospel
shall
never
be
annulled
and
that
whensoever
the
promised
beauty
is
made
manifest
and
all
the
signs
are
revealed
he
must
needs
and
establish
the
law
proclaimed
in
the
gospel
so
that
there
may
remain
in
the
world
no
faith
but
his
faith
this
is
their
fundamental
belief
and
their
conviction
is
such
that
were
a
person
to
be
made
manifest
with
all
the
promised
signs
and
to
promulgate
that
which
is
contrary
to
the
letter
of
the
law
of
the
gospel
they
must
assuredly
renounce
him
refuse
to
submit
to
his
law
declare
him
an
infidel
and
laugh
him
to
scorn
this
is
proved
by
that
which
came
to
pass
when
the
sun
of
the
muḥammadan
revelation
was
revealed
had
they
sought
with
a
humble
mind
from
the
manifestations
of
god
in
every
dispensation
the
true
meaning
of
these
words
revealed
in
the
sacred
the
misapprehension
of
which
hath
caused
men
to
be
deprived
of
the
recognition
of
the
sadratu
the
ultimate
surely
would
have
been
guided
to
the
light
of
the
sun
of
truth
and
would
have
discovered
the
mysteries
of
divine
knowledge
and
wisdom
this
servant
will
now
share
with
thee
a
dewdrop
out
of
the
fathomless
ocean
of
the
truths
treasured
in
these
holy
words
that
haply
discerning
hearts
may
comprehend
all
the
allusions
and
the
implications
of
the
utterances
of
the
manifestations
of
holiness
so
that
the
overpowering
majesty
of
the
word
of
god
may
not
prevent
them
from
attaining
unto
the
ocean
of
his
names
and
attributes
nor
deprive
them
of
recognizing
the
lamp
of
god
which
is
the
seat
of
the
revelation
of
his
glorified
essence
as
to
the
immediately
after
the
oppression
of
those
days
refer
to
the
time
when
men
shall
become
oppressed
and
afflicted
the
time
when
the
lingering
traces
of
the
sun
of
truth
and
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
wisdom
will
have
vanished
from
the
midst
of
men
when
the
reins
of
mankind
will
have
fallen
into
the
grasp
of
the
foolish
and
ignorant
when
the
portals
of
divine
unity
and
essential
and
highest
purpose
in
have
been
closed
when
certain
knowledge
will
have
given
way
to
idle
fancy
and
corruption
will
have
usurped
the
station
of
righteousness
such
a
condition
as
this
is
witnessed
in
this
day
when
the
reins
of
every
community
have
fallen
into
the
grasp
of
foolish
leaders
who
lead
after
their
own
whims
and
desire
on
their
tongue
the
mention
of
god
hath
become
an
empty
name
in
their
midst
his
holy
word
a
dead
letter
such
is
the
sway
of
their
desires
that
the
lamp
of
conscience
and
reason
hath
been
quenched
in
their
hearts
and
this
although
the
fingers
of
divine
power
have
unlocked
the
portals
of
the
knowledge
of
god
and
the
light
of
divine
knowledge
and
heavenly
grace
hath
illumined
and
inspired
the
essence
of
all
created
things
in
such
wise
that
in
each
and
every
thing
a
door
of
knowledge
hath
been
opened
and
within
every
atom
traces
of
the
sun
hath
been
made
manifest
and
yet
in
spite
of
all
these
manifold
revelations
of
divine
knowledge
which
have
encompassed
the
world
they
still
vainly
imagine
the
door
of
knowledge
to
be
closed
and
the
showers
of
mercy
to
be
stilled
clinging
unto
idle
fancy
they
have
strayed
far
from
the
urvatu
of
divine
knowledge
their
hearts
seem
not
to
be
inclined
to
knowledge
and
the
door
thereof
neither
think
they
of
its
manifestations
inasmuch
as
in
idle
fancy
they
have
found
the
door
that
leadeth
unto
earthly
riches
whereas
in
the
manifestation
of
the
revealer
of
knowledge
they
find
naught
but
the
call
to
they
therefore
naturally
hold
fast
unto
the
former
and
flee
from
the
latter
though
they
recognize
in
their
hearts
the
law
of
god
to
be
one
and
the
same
yet
from
every
direction
they
issue
a
new
command
and
in
every
season
proclaim
a
fresh
decree
no
two
are
found
to
agree
on
one
and
the
same
law
for
they
seek
no
god
but
their
own
desire
and
tread
no
path
but
the
path
of
error
in
leadership
they
have
recognized
the
ultimate
object
of
their
endeavour
and
account
pride
and
haughtiness
as
the
highest
attainments
of
their
heart
s
desire
they
have
placed
their
sordid
machinations
above
the
divine
decree
have
renounced
resignation
unto
the
will
of
god
busied
themselves
with
selfish
calculation
and
walked
in
the
way
of
the
hypocrite
with
all
their
power
and
strength
they
strive
to
secure
themselves
in
their
petty
pursuits
fearful
lest
the
least
discredit
undermine
their
authority
or
blemish
the
display
of
their
magnificence
were
the
eye
to
be
anointed
and
illumined
with
the
collyrium
of
the
knowledge
of
god
it
would
surely
discover
that
a
number
of
voracious
beasts
have
gathered
and
preyed
upon
the
carrion
of
the
souls
of
men
what
oppression
is
greater
than
that
which
hath
been
recounted
what
oppression
is
more
grievous
than
that
a
soul
seeking
the
truth
and
wishing
to
attain
unto
the
knowledge
of
god
should
know
not
where
to
go
for
it
and
from
whom
to
seek
it
for
opinions
have
sorely
differed
and
the
ways
unto
the
attainment
of
god
have
multiplied
this
oppression
is
the
essential
feature
of
every
revelation
unless
it
cometh
to
pass
the
sun
of
truth
will
not
be
made
manifest
for
the
break
of
the
morn
of
divine
guidance
must
needs
follow
the
darkness
of
the
night
of
error
for
this
reason
in
all
chronicles
and
traditions
reference
hath
been
made
unto
these
things
namely
that
iniquity
shall
cover
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
darkness
shall
envelop
mankind
as
the
traditions
referred
to
are
well
known
and
as
the
purpose
of
this
servant
is
to
be
brief
he
will
refrain
from
quoting
the
text
of
these
traditions
were
this
oppression
which
literally
meaneth
pressure
to
be
interpreted
that
the
earth
is
to
become
contracted
or
were
men
s
idle
fancy
to
conceive
similar
calamities
to
befall
mankind
it
is
clear
and
manifest
that
no
such
happenings
can
ever
come
to
pass
they
will
assuredly
protest
that
this
of
divine
revelation
hath
not
been
made
manifest
such
hath
been
and
still
is
their
contention
whereas
by
oppression
is
meant
the
want
of
capacity
to
acquire
spiritual
knowledge
and
apprehend
the
word
of
god
by
it
is
meant
that
when
the
of
truth
hath
set
and
the
mirrors
that
reflect
his
light
have
departed
mankind
will
become
afflicted
with
oppression
and
hardship
knowing
not
whither
to
turn
for
guidance
thus
we
instruct
thee
in
the
interpretation
of
the
traditions
and
reveal
unto
thee
the
mysteries
of
divine
wisdom
that
haply
thou
mayest
comprehend
the
meaning
thereof
and
be
of
them
that
have
quaffed
the
cup
of
divine
knowledge
and
understanding
and
now
concerning
his
the
sun
shall
be
darkened
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
light
and
the
stars
shall
fall
from
by
the
terms
sun
and
moon
mentioned
in
the
writings
of
the
prophets
of
god
is
not
meant
solely
the
sun
and
moon
of
the
visible
universe
nay
rather
manifold
are
the
meanings
they
have
intended
for
these
terms
in
every
instance
they
have
attached
to
them
a
particular
significance
thus
by
the
sun
in
one
sense
is
meant
those
suns
of
truth
who
rise
from
the
dayspring
of
ancient
glory
and
fill
the
world
with
a
liberal
effusion
of
grace
from
on
high
these
suns
of
truth
are
the
universal
manifestations
of
god
in
the
worlds
of
his
attributes
and
names
even
as
the
visible
sun
that
assisteth
as
decreed
by
god
the
true
one
the
adored
in
the
development
of
all
earthly
things
such
as
the
trees
the
fruits
and
colours
thereof
the
minerals
of
the
earth
and
all
that
may
be
witnessed
in
the
world
of
creation
so
do
the
divine
luminaries
by
their
loving
care
and
educative
influence
cause
the
trees
of
divine
unity
the
fruits
of
his
oneness
the
leaves
of
detachment
the
blossoms
of
knowledge
and
certitude
and
the
myrtles
of
wisdom
and
utterance
to
exist
and
be
made
manifest
thus
it
is
that
through
the
rise
of
these
luminaries
of
god
the
world
is
made
new
the
waters
of
everlasting
life
stream
forth
the
billows
of
surge
the
clouds
of
grace
are
gathered
and
the
breeze
of
bounty
bloweth
upon
all
created
things
it
is
the
warmth
that
these
luminaries
of
god
generate
and
the
undying
fires
they
kindle
which
cause
the
light
of
the
love
of
god
to
burn
fiercely
in
the
heart
of
humanity
it
is
through
the
abundant
grace
of
these
symbols
of
detachment
that
the
spirit
of
life
everlasting
is
breathed
into
the
bodies
of
the
dead
assuredly
the
visible
sun
is
but
a
sign
of
the
splendour
of
that
of
truth
that
sun
which
can
never
have
a
peer
a
likeness
or
rival
through
him
all
things
live
move
and
have
their
being
through
his
grace
they
are
made
manifest
and
unto
him
they
all
return
from
him
all
things
have
sprung
and
unto
the
treasuries
of
his
revelation
they
all
have
repaired
from
him
all
created
things
did
proceed
and
to
the
depositories
of
his
law
they
did
revert
that
these
divine
luminaries
seem
to
be
confined
at
times
to
specific
designations
and
attributes
as
you
have
observed
and
are
now
observing
is
due
solely
to
the
imperfect
and
limited
comprehension
of
certain
minds
otherwise
they
have
been
at
all
times
and
will
through
eternity
continue
to
be
exalted
above
every
praising
name
and
sanctified
from
every
descriptive
attribute
the
quintessence
of
every
name
can
hope
for
no
access
unto
their
court
of
holiness
and
the
highest
and
purest
of
all
attributes
can
never
approach
their
kingdom
of
glory
immeasurably
high
are
the
prophets
of
god
exalted
above
the
comprehension
of
men
who
can
never
know
them
except
by
their
own
selves
far
be
it
from
his
glory
that
his
chosen
ones
should
be
magnified
by
any
other
than
their
own
persons
glorified
are
they
above
the
praise
of
men
exalted
are
they
above
human
understanding
the
term
suns
hath
many
a
time
been
applied
in
the
writings
of
the
immaculate
souls
unto
the
prophets
of
god
those
luminous
emblems
of
detachment
among
those
writings
are
the
following
words
recorded
in
the
prayer
of
nudbih
whither
are
gone
the
resplendent
suns
whereunto
have
departed
those
shining
moons
and
sparkling
stars
thus
it
hath
become
evident
that
the
terms
sun
moon
and
stars
primarily
signify
the
prophets
of
god
the
saints
and
their
companions
those
luminaries
the
light
of
whose
knowledge
hath
shed
illumination
upon
the
worlds
of
the
visible
and
the
invisible
in
another
sense
by
these
terms
is
intended
the
divines
of
the
former
dispensation
who
live
in
the
days
of
the
subsequent
revelations
and
who
hold
the
reins
of
religion
in
their
grasp
if
these
divines
be
illumined
by
the
light
of
the
latter
revelation
they
will
be
acceptable
unto
god
and
will
shine
with
a
light
everlasting
otherwise
they
will
be
declared
as
darkened
even
though
to
outward
seeming
they
be
leaders
of
men
inasmuch
as
belief
and
unbelief
guidance
and
error
felicity
and
misery
light
and
darkness
are
all
dependent
upon
the
sanction
of
him
who
is
the
of
truth
whosoever
among
the
divines
of
every
age
receiveth
in
the
day
of
reckoning
the
testimony
of
faith
from
the
source
of
true
knowledge
he
verily
becometh
the
recipient
of
learning
of
divine
favour
and
of
the
light
of
true
understanding
otherwise
he
is
branded
as
guilty
of
folly
denial
blasphemy
and
oppression
it
is
evident
and
manifest
unto
every
discerning
observer
that
even
as
the
light
of
the
star
fadeth
before
the
effulgent
splendour
of
the
sun
so
doth
the
luminary
of
earthly
knowledge
of
wisdom
and
understanding
vanish
into
nothingness
when
brought
face
to
face
with
the
resplendent
glories
of
the
sun
of
truth
the
of
divine
enlightenment
that
the
term
sun
hath
been
applied
to
the
leaders
of
religion
is
due
to
their
lofty
position
their
fame
and
renown
such
are
the
universally
recognized
divines
of
every
age
who
speak
with
authority
and
whose
fame
is
securely
established
if
they
be
in
the
likeness
of
the
sun
of
truth
they
will
surely
be
accounted
as
the
most
exalted
of
all
luminaries
otherwise
they
are
to
be
recognized
as
the
focal
centres
of
hellish
fire
even
as
he
saith
verily
the
sun
and
the
moon
are
both
condemned
to
the
torment
of
infernal
you
are
no
doubt
familiar
with
the
interpretation
of
the
term
sun
and
moon
mentioned
in
this
verse
no
need
therefore
to
refer
unto
it
and
whosoever
is
of
the
element
of
this
sun
and
moon
that
is
followeth
the
example
of
these
leaders
in
setting
his
face
towards
falsehood
and
in
turning
away
from
the
truth
he
undoubtedly
cometh
out
of
infernal
gloom
and
returneth
thereunto
and
now
o
seeker
it
behooveth
us
firmly
to
cling
unto
the
urvatu
that
perchance
we
may
leave
behind
the
darksome
night
of
error
and
embrace
the
dawning
light
of
divine
guidance
shall
we
not
flee
from
the
face
of
denial
and
seek
the
sheltering
shadow
of
certitude
shall
we
not
free
ourselves
from
the
horror
of
satanic
gloom
and
hasten
towards
the
rising
light
of
the
heavenly
beauty
in
such
wise
we
bestow
upon
you
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
divine
knowledge
that
ye
may
gladly
and
joyously
abide
in
the
ridván
of
divine
wisdom
in
another
sense
by
the
terms
sun
moon
and
stars
are
meant
such
laws
and
teachings
as
have
been
established
and
proclaimed
in
every
dispensation
such
as
the
laws
of
prayer
and
fasting
these
have
according
to
the
law
of
the
qur
án
been
regarded
when
the
beauty
of
the
prophet
muḥammad
had
passed
beyond
the
veil
as
the
most
fundamental
and
binding
laws
of
his
dispensation
to
this
testify
the
texts
of
the
traditions
and
chronicles
which
on
account
of
their
being
widely
known
need
not
be
referred
to
here
nay
rather
in
every
dispensation
the
law
concerning
prayer
hath
been
emphasized
and
universally
enforced
to
this
testify
the
recorded
traditions
ascribed
to
the
lights
that
have
emanated
from
the
of
truth
the
essence
of
the
prophet
muḥammad
the
traditions
established
the
fact
that
in
all
dispensations
the
law
of
prayer
hath
constituted
a
fundamental
element
of
the
revelation
of
all
the
prophets
of
law
the
form
and
the
manner
of
which
hath
been
adapted
to
the
varying
requirements
of
every
age
inasmuch
as
every
subsequent
revelation
hath
abolished
the
manners
habits
and
teachings
that
have
been
clearly
specifically
and
firmly
established
by
the
former
dispensation
these
have
accordingly
been
symbolically
expressed
in
terms
of
sun
and
moon
that
he
might
prove
you
which
of
you
excel
in
moreover
in
the
traditions
the
terms
sun
and
moon
have
been
applied
to
prayer
and
fasting
even
as
it
is
said
fasting
is
illumination
prayer
is
one
day
a
divine
came
to
visit
us
while
we
were
conversing
with
him
he
referred
to
the
tradition
he
said
inasmuch
as
fasting
causeth
the
heat
of
the
body
to
increase
it
hath
therefore
been
likened
unto
the
light
of
the
sun
and
as
the
prayer
of
the
refresheth
man
it
hath
been
compared
unto
the
radiance
of
the
thereupon
we
realized
that
that
poor
man
had
not
been
favoured
with
a
single
drop
of
the
ocean
of
true
understanding
and
had
strayed
far
from
the
burning
bush
of
divine
wisdom
we
then
politely
observed
to
him
saying
the
interpretation
your
honour
hath
given
to
this
tradition
is
the
one
current
amongst
the
people
could
it
not
be
interpreted
differently
he
asked
us
what
could
it
be
we
made
reply
muḥammad
the
seal
of
the
prophets
and
the
most
distinguished
of
god
s
chosen
ones
hath
likened
the
dispensation
of
the
qur
án
unto
heaven
by
reason
of
its
loftiness
its
paramount
influence
its
majesty
and
the
fact
that
it
comprehendeth
all
religions
and
as
the
sun
and
moon
constitute
the
brightest
and
most
prominent
luminaries
in
the
heavens
similarly
in
the
heaven
of
the
religion
of
god
two
shining
orbs
have
been
and
prayer
islám
is
heaven
fasting
is
its
sun
prayer
its
this
is
the
purpose
underlying
the
symbolic
words
of
the
manifestations
of
god
consequently
the
application
of
the
terms
sun
and
moon
to
the
things
already
mentioned
hath
been
demonstrated
and
justified
by
the
text
of
the
sacred
verses
and
the
recorded
traditions
hence
it
is
clear
and
manifest
that
by
the
words
the
sun
shall
be
darkened
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light
and
the
stars
shall
fall
from
heaven
is
intended
the
waywardness
of
the
divines
and
the
annulment
of
laws
firmly
established
by
divine
revelation
all
of
which
in
symbolic
language
have
been
foreshadowed
by
the
manifestation
of
god
none
except
the
righteous
shall
partake
of
this
cup
none
but
the
godly
can
share
therein
the
righteous
shall
drink
of
a
cup
tempered
at
the
camphor
it
is
unquestionable
that
in
every
succeeding
revelation
the
sun
and
moon
of
the
teachings
laws
commandments
and
prohibitions
which
have
been
established
in
the
preceding
dispensation
and
which
have
overshadowed
the
people
of
that
age
become
darkened
that
is
are
exhausted
and
cease
to
exert
their
influence
consider
now
had
the
people
of
the
gospel
recognized
the
meaning
of
the
symbolic
terms
sun
and
moon
had
they
sought
unlike
the
froward
and
perverse
enlightenment
from
him
who
is
the
revealer
of
divine
knowledge
they
would
have
surely
comprehended
the
purpose
of
these
terms
and
would
not
have
become
afflicted
and
oppressed
by
the
darkness
of
their
selfish
desires
yea
but
since
they
have
failed
to
acquire
true
knowledge
from
its
very
source
they
have
perished
in
the
perilous
vale
of
waywardness
and
misbelief
they
still
have
not
awakened
to
perceive
that
all
the
signs
foretold
have
been
made
manifest
that
the
promised
sun
hath
risen
above
the
horizon
of
divine
revelation
and
that
the
sun
and
moon
of
the
teachings
the
laws
and
learning
of
a
former
dispensation
have
darkened
and
set
and
now
with
fixed
gaze
and
steady
wings
enter
thou
the
way
of
certitude
and
truth
say
it
is
god
then
leave
them
to
entertain
themselves
with
their
thus
wilt
thou
be
accounted
of
those
companions
of
whom
he
saith
they
that
say
our
lord
is
god
and
continue
steadfast
in
his
way
upon
them
verily
shall
the
angels
then
shalt
thou
witness
all
these
mysteries
with
thine
own
eyes
o
my
brother
take
thou
the
step
of
the
spirit
so
that
swift
as
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
thou
mayest
flash
through
the
wilds
of
remoteness
and
bereavement
attain
the
ridván
of
everlasting
reunion
and
in
one
breath
commune
with
the
heavenly
spirits
for
with
human
feet
thou
canst
never
hope
to
traverse
these
immeasurable
distances
nor
attain
thy
goal
peace
be
upon
him
whom
the
light
of
truth
guideth
unto
all
truth
and
who
in
the
name
of
god
standeth
in
the
path
of
his
cause
upon
the
shore
of
true
understanding
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
sacred
verse
but
nay
i
swear
by
the
lord
of
the
easts
and
the
wests
inasmuch
as
the
suns
referred
to
have
each
their
own
particular
rising
and
setting
place
and
as
the
commentators
of
the
qur
án
have
failed
to
grasp
the
symbolic
meaning
of
these
suns
they
therefore
were
at
pains
to
interpret
the
verse
some
of
them
maintained
that
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
sun
each
day
rises
from
a
different
point
the
terms
easts
and
wests
have
been
mentioned
in
the
plural
others
have
written
that
by
this
verse
the
four
seasons
of
the
year
are
intended
inasmuch
as
the
dawning
and
setting
points
of
the
sun
vary
with
the
change
of
the
seasons
such
is
the
depth
of
their
understanding
none
the
less
they
persist
in
imputing
error
and
folly
to
those
gems
of
knowledge
those
irreproachable
and
purest
symbols
of
wisdom
in
like
manner
strive
thou
to
comprehend
from
these
lucid
these
powerful
conclusive
and
unequivocal
statements
the
meaning
of
the
cleaving
of
the
heaven
of
the
signs
that
must
needs
herald
the
coming
of
the
last
hour
the
day
of
resurrection
as
he
hath
said
when
the
heaven
shall
be
cloven
by
heaven
is
meant
the
heaven
of
divine
revelation
which
is
elevated
with
every
manifestation
and
rent
asunder
with
every
subsequent
one
by
cloven
asunder
is
meant
that
the
former
dispensation
is
superseded
and
annulled
i
swear
by
god
that
this
heaven
being
cloven
asunder
is
to
the
discerning
an
act
mightier
than
the
cleaving
of
the
skies
ponder
a
while
that
a
divine
revelation
which
for
years
hath
been
securely
established
beneath
whose
shadow
all
who
have
embraced
it
have
been
reared
and
nurtured
by
the
light
of
whose
law
generations
of
men
have
been
disciplined
the
excellency
of
whose
word
men
have
heard
recounted
by
their
fathers
in
such
wise
that
human
eye
hath
beheld
naught
but
the
pervading
influence
of
its
grace
and
mortal
ear
hath
heard
naught
but
the
resounding
majesty
of
its
act
is
mightier
than
that
such
a
revelation
should
by
the
power
of
god
be
cloven
asunder
and
be
abolished
at
the
appearance
of
one
soul
reflect
is
this
a
mightier
act
than
that
which
these
abject
and
foolish
men
have
imagined
the
cleaving
of
the
heaven
to
mean
moreover
consider
the
hardships
and
the
bitterness
of
the
lives
of
those
revealers
of
the
divine
beauty
reflect
how
and
alone
they
faced
the
world
and
all
its
peoples
and
promulgated
the
law
of
god
no
matter
how
severe
the
persecutions
inflicted
upon
those
holy
those
precious
and
tender
souls
they
still
remained
in
the
plenitude
of
their
power
patient
and
despite
their
ascendancy
they
suffered
and
endured
in
like
manner
endeavour
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
changing
of
the
know
thou
that
upon
whatever
hearts
the
bountiful
showers
of
mercy
raining
from
the
heaven
of
divine
revelation
have
fallen
the
earth
of
those
hearts
hath
verily
been
changed
into
the
earth
of
divine
knowledge
and
wisdom
what
myrtles
of
unity
hath
the
soil
of
their
hearts
produced
what
blossoms
of
true
knowledge
and
wisdom
hath
their
illumined
bosoms
yielded
were
the
earth
of
their
hearts
to
remain
unchanged
how
could
such
souls
who
have
not
been
taught
one
letter
have
seen
no
teacher
and
entered
no
school
utter
such
words
and
display
such
knowledge
as
none
can
apprehend
methinks
they
have
been
moulded
from
the
clay
of
infinite
knowledge
and
kneaded
with
the
water
of
divine
wisdom
therefore
hath
it
been
said
knowledge
is
a
light
which
god
casteth
into
the
heart
of
whomsoever
he
it
is
this
kind
of
knowledge
which
is
and
hath
ever
been
praiseworthy
and
not
the
limited
knowledge
that
hath
sprung
forth
from
veiled
and
obscured
minds
this
limited
knowledge
they
even
stealthily
borrow
one
from
the
other
and
vainly
pride
themselves
therein
would
that
the
hearts
of
men
could
be
cleansed
from
these
limitations
and
obscure
thoughts
imposed
upon
them
haply
they
may
be
illumined
by
the
light
of
the
sun
of
true
knowledge
and
comprehend
the
mysteries
of
divine
wisdom
consider
now
were
the
parched
and
barren
soil
of
these
hearts
to
remain
unchanged
how
could
they
ever
become
the
recipients
of
the
revelation
of
the
mysteries
of
god
and
the
revealers
of
the
divine
essence
thus
hath
he
said
on
the
day
when
the
earth
shall
be
changed
into
another
the
breeze
of
the
bounty
of
the
king
of
creation
hath
caused
even
the
physical
earth
to
be
changed
were
ye
to
ponder
in
your
hearts
the
mysteries
of
divine
revelation
and
now
comprehend
the
meaning
of
this
verse
the
whole
earth
shall
on
the
resurrection
day
be
but
his
handful
and
in
his
right
hand
shall
the
heavens
be
folded
together
praise
be
to
him
and
high
be
he
uplifted
above
the
partners
they
join
with
him
and
now
be
fair
in
thy
judgment
were
this
verse
to
have
the
meaning
which
men
suppose
it
to
have
of
what
profit
one
may
ask
could
it
be
to
man
moreover
it
is
evident
and
manifest
that
no
such
hand
as
could
be
seen
by
human
eye
could
accomplish
such
deeds
or
could
possibly
be
ascribed
to
the
exalted
essence
of
the
one
true
god
nay
to
acknowledge
such
a
thing
is
naught
but
sheer
blasphemy
an
utter
perversion
of
the
truth
and
should
it
be
supposed
that
by
this
verse
are
meant
the
manifestations
of
god
who
will
be
called
upon
on
the
day
of
judgment
to
perform
such
deeds
this
too
seemeth
far
from
the
truth
and
is
surely
of
no
profit
on
the
contrary
by
the
term
earth
is
meant
the
earth
of
understanding
and
knowledge
and
by
heavens
the
heavens
of
divine
revelation
reflect
thou
how
in
one
hand
he
hath
by
his
mighty
grasp
turned
the
earth
of
knowledge
and
understanding
previously
unfolded
into
a
mere
handful
and
on
the
other
spread
out
a
new
and
highly
exalted
earth
in
the
hearts
of
men
thus
causing
the
freshest
and
loveliest
blossoms
and
the
mightiest
and
loftiest
trees
to
spring
forth
from
the
illumined
bosom
of
man
in
like
manner
reflect
how
the
elevated
heavens
of
the
dispensations
of
the
past
have
in
the
right
hand
of
power
been
folded
together
how
the
heavens
of
divine
revelation
have
been
raised
by
the
command
of
god
and
been
adorned
by
the
sun
the
moon
and
stars
of
his
wondrous
commandments
such
are
the
mysteries
of
the
word
of
god
which
have
been
unveiled
and
made
manifest
that
haply
thou
mayest
apprehend
the
morning
light
of
divine
guidance
mayest
quench
by
the
power
of
reliance
and
renunciation
the
lamp
of
idle
fancy
of
vain
imaginings
of
hesitation
and
doubt
and
mayest
kindle
in
the
inmost
chamber
of
thine
heart
the
light
of
divine
knowledge
and
certitude
know
verily
that
the
purpose
underlying
all
these
symbolic
terms
and
abstruse
allusions
which
emanate
from
the
revealers
of
god
s
holy
cause
hath
been
to
test
and
prove
the
peoples
of
the
world
that
thereby
the
earth
of
the
pure
and
illuminated
hearts
may
be
known
from
the
perishable
and
barren
soil
from
time
immemorial
such
hath
been
the
way
of
god
amidst
his
creatures
and
to
this
testify
the
records
of
the
sacred
books
and
likewise
reflect
upon
the
revealed
verse
concerning
the
when
muḥammad
the
sun
of
prophethood
had
fled
from
the
dayspring
of
bathá
unto
yathrib
he
continued
to
turn
his
face
while
praying
unto
jerusalem
the
holy
city
until
the
time
when
the
jews
began
to
utter
unseemly
words
against
which
if
mentioned
would
ill
befit
these
pages
and
would
weary
the
reader
muḥammad
strongly
resented
these
words
whilst
wrapt
in
meditation
and
wonder
he
was
gazing
toward
heaven
he
heard
the
kindly
voice
of
gabriel
saying
we
behold
thee
from
above
turning
thy
face
to
heaven
but
we
will
have
thee
turn
to
a
qiblih
which
shall
please
on
a
subsequent
day
when
the
prophet
together
with
his
companions
was
offering
the
noontide
prayer
and
had
already
performed
two
of
the
prescribed
rik
áts
the
voice
of
gabriel
was
heard
again
turn
thou
thy
face
towards
the
sacred
in
the
midst
of
that
same
prayer
muḥammad
suddenly
turned
his
face
away
from
jerusalem
and
faced
the
ka
bih
whereupon
a
profound
dismay
seized
suddenly
the
companions
of
the
prophet
their
faith
was
shaken
severely
so
great
was
their
alarm
that
many
of
them
discontinuing
their
prayer
apostatized
their
faith
verily
god
caused
not
this
turmoil
but
to
test
and
prove
his
servants
otherwise
he
the
ideal
king
could
easily
have
left
the
qiblih
unchanged
and
could
have
caused
jerusalem
to
remain
the
point
of
adoration
unto
his
dispensation
thereby
withholding
not
from
that
holy
city
the
distinction
of
acceptance
which
had
been
conferred
upon
it
none
of
the
many
prophets
sent
down
since
moses
was
made
manifest
as
messengers
of
the
word
of
god
such
as
david
jesus
and
others
among
the
more
exalted
manifestations
who
have
appeared
during
the
intervening
period
between
the
revelations
of
moses
and
muḥammad
ever
altered
the
law
of
the
qiblih
these
messengers
of
the
lord
of
creation
have
one
and
all
directed
their
peoples
to
turn
unto
the
same
direction
in
the
eyes
of
god
the
ideal
king
all
the
places
of
the
earth
are
one
and
the
same
excepting
that
place
which
in
the
days
of
his
manifestations
he
doth
appoint
for
a
particular
purpose
even
as
he
hath
revealed
the
east
and
west
are
god
s
therefore
whichever
way
ye
turn
there
is
the
face
of
notwithstanding
the
truth
of
these
facts
why
should
the
qiblih
have
been
changed
thus
casting
such
dismay
amongst
the
people
causing
the
companions
of
the
prophet
to
waver
and
throwing
so
great
a
confusion
into
their
midst
yea
such
things
as
throw
consternation
into
the
hearts
of
all
men
come
to
pass
only
that
each
soul
may
be
tested
by
the
touchstone
of
god
that
the
true
may
be
known
and
distinguished
from
the
false
thus
hath
he
revealed
after
the
breach
amongst
the
people
we
did
not
appoint
that
which
thou
wouldst
have
to
be
the
qiblih
but
that
we
might
know
him
who
followeth
the
apostle
from
him
who
turneth
on
his
affrighted
asses
fleeing
from
a
were
you
to
ponder
but
for
a
while
these
utterances
in
your
heart
you
would
surely
find
the
portals
of
understanding
unlocked
before
your
face
and
would
behold
all
knowledge
and
the
mysteries
thereof
unveiled
before
your
eyes
such
things
take
place
only
that
the
souls
of
men
may
develop
and
be
delivered
from
the
of
self
and
desire
otherwise
that
ideal
king
hath
throughout
eternity
been
in
his
essence
independent
of
the
comprehension
of
all
beings
and
will
continue
for
ever
in
his
own
being
to
be
exalted
above
the
adoration
of
every
soul
a
single
breeze
of
his
affluence
doth
suffice
to
adorn
all
mankind
with
the
robe
of
wealth
and
one
drop
out
of
the
ocean
of
his
bountiful
grace
is
enough
to
confer
upon
all
beings
the
glory
of
everlasting
life
but
inasmuch
as
the
divine
purpose
hath
decreed
that
the
true
should
be
known
from
the
false
and
the
sun
from
the
shadow
he
hath
therefore
in
every
season
sent
down
upon
mankind
the
showers
of
tests
from
his
realm
of
glory
were
men
to
meditate
upon
the
lives
of
the
prophets
of
old
so
easily
would
they
come
to
know
and
understand
the
ways
of
these
prophets
that
they
would
cease
to
be
veiled
by
such
deeds
and
words
as
are
contrary
to
their
own
worldly
desires
and
thus
consume
every
intervening
veil
with
the
fire
burning
in
the
bush
of
divine
knowledge
and
abide
secure
upon
the
throne
of
peace
and
certitude
for
instance
consider
moses
son
of
imrán
one
of
the
exalted
prophets
and
author
of
a
book
whilst
passing
one
day
through
the
market
in
his
early
days
ere
his
ministry
was
proclaimed
he
saw
two
men
engaged
in
fighting
one
of
them
asked
the
help
of
moses
against
his
opponent
whereupon
moses
intervened
and
slew
him
to
this
testifieth
the
record
of
the
sacred
book
should
the
details
be
cited
they
will
lengthen
and
interrupt
the
course
of
the
argument
the
report
of
this
incident
spread
throughout
the
city
and
moses
was
full
of
fear
as
is
witnessed
by
the
text
of
the
book
and
when
the
warning
o
moses
of
a
truth
the
chiefs
take
counsel
to
slay
thee
reached
his
ears
he
went
forth
from
the
city
and
sojourned
in
midian
in
the
service
of
shoeb
while
returning
moses
entered
the
holy
vale
situate
in
the
wilderness
of
sinai
and
there
beheld
the
vision
of
the
king
of
glory
from
the
tree
that
belongeth
neither
to
the
east
nor
to
the
there
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
spirit
speaking
from
out
of
the
kindled
fire
bidding
him
to
shed
upon
pharaonic
souls
the
light
of
divine
guidance
so
that
liberating
them
from
the
shadows
of
the
valley
of
self
and
desire
he
might
enable
them
to
attain
the
meads
of
heavenly
delight
and
delivering
them
through
the
salsabíl
of
renunciation
from
the
bewilderment
of
remoteness
cause
them
to
enter
the
peaceful
city
of
the
divine
presence
when
moses
came
unto
pharaoh
and
delivered
unto
him
as
bidden
by
god
the
divine
message
pharaoh
spoke
insultingly
saying
art
thou
not
he
that
committed
murder
and
became
an
infidel
thus
recounted
the
lord
of
majesty
as
having
been
said
by
pharaoh
unto
moses
what
a
deed
is
that
which
thou
hast
done
thou
art
one
of
the
ungrateful
he
said
i
did
it
indeed
and
i
was
one
of
those
who
erred
and
i
fled
from
you
when
i
feared
you
but
my
lord
hath
given
me
wisdom
and
hath
made
me
one
of
his
and
now
ponder
in
thy
heart
the
commotion
which
god
stirreth
up
reflect
upon
the
strange
and
manifold
trials
with
which
he
doth
test
his
servants
consider
how
he
hath
suddenly
chosen
from
among
his
servants
and
entrusted
with
the
exalted
mission
of
divine
guidance
him
who
was
known
as
guilty
of
homicide
who
himself
had
acknowledged
his
cruelty
and
who
for
thirty
years
had
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
been
reared
in
the
home
of
pharaoh
and
been
nourished
at
his
table
was
not
god
the
omnipotent
king
able
to
withhold
the
hand
of
moses
from
murder
so
that
manslaughter
should
not
be
attributed
unto
him
causing
bewilderment
and
aversion
among
the
people
likewise
reflect
upon
the
state
and
condition
of
mary
so
deep
was
the
perplexity
of
that
most
beauteous
countenance
so
grievous
her
case
that
she
bitterly
regretted
she
had
ever
been
born
to
this
beareth
witness
the
text
of
the
sacred
verse
wherein
it
is
mentioned
that
after
mary
had
given
birth
to
jesus
she
bemoaned
her
plight
and
cried
out
o
would
that
i
had
died
ere
this
and
been
a
thing
forgotten
forgotten
quite
i
swear
by
god
such
lamenting
consumeth
the
heart
and
shaketh
the
being
such
consternation
of
soul
such
despondency
could
have
been
caused
by
no
other
than
the
censure
of
the
enemy
and
the
cavilings
of
the
infidel
and
perverse
reflect
what
answer
could
mary
have
given
to
the
people
around
her
how
could
she
claim
that
a
babe
whose
father
was
unknown
had
been
conceived
of
the
holy
ghost
therefore
did
mary
that
veiled
and
immortal
countenance
take
up
her
child
and
return
unto
her
home
no
sooner
had
the
eyes
of
the
people
fallen
upon
her
than
they
raised
their
voice
saying
o
sister
of
aaron
thy
father
was
not
a
man
of
wickedness
nor
unchaste
thy
and
now
meditate
upon
this
most
great
convulsion
this
grievous
test
notwithstanding
all
these
things
god
conferred
upon
that
essence
of
the
spirit
who
was
known
amongst
the
people
as
fatherless
the
glory
of
prophethood
and
made
him
his
testimony
unto
all
that
are
in
heaven
and
on
earth
behold
how
contrary
are
the
ways
of
the
manifestations
of
god
as
ordained
by
the
king
of
creation
to
the
ways
and
desires
of
men
as
thou
comest
to
comprehend
the
essence
of
these
divine
mysteries
thou
wilt
grasp
the
purpose
of
god
the
divine
charmer
the
thou
wilt
regard
the
words
and
the
deeds
of
that
almighty
sovereign
as
one
and
the
same
in
such
wise
that
whatsoever
thou
dost
behold
in
his
deeds
the
same
wilt
thou
find
in
his
sayings
and
whatsoever
thou
dost
read
in
his
sayings
that
wilt
thou
recognize
in
his
deeds
thus
it
is
that
outwardly
such
deeds
and
words
are
the
fire
of
vengeance
unto
the
wicked
and
inwardly
the
waters
of
mercy
unto
the
righteous
were
the
eye
of
the
heart
to
open
it
would
surely
perceive
that
the
words
revealed
from
the
heaven
of
the
will
of
god
are
at
one
with
and
the
same
as
the
deeds
that
have
emanated
from
the
kingdom
of
divine
power
and
now
take
heed
o
brother
if
such
things
be
revealed
in
this
dispensation
and
such
incidents
come
to
pass
at
the
present
time
what
would
the
people
do
i
swear
by
him
who
is
the
true
educator
of
mankind
and
the
revealer
of
the
word
of
god
that
the
people
would
instantly
and
unquestionably
pronounce
him
an
infidel
and
would
sentence
him
to
death
how
far
are
they
from
hearkening
unto
the
voice
that
declareth
lo
a
jesus
hath
appeared
out
of
the
breath
of
the
holy
ghost
and
a
moses
summoned
to
a
task
were
a
myriad
voices
to
be
raised
no
ear
would
listen
if
we
said
that
upon
a
fatherless
child
hath
been
conferred
the
mission
of
prophethood
or
that
a
murderer
hath
brought
from
the
flame
of
the
burning
bush
the
message
of
verily
verily
i
am
god
if
the
eye
of
justice
be
opened
it
will
readily
recognize
in
the
light
of
that
which
hath
been
mentioned
that
he
who
is
the
cause
and
ultimate
purpose
of
all
these
things
is
made
manifest
in
this
day
though
similar
events
have
not
occurred
in
this
dispensation
yet
the
people
still
cling
to
such
vain
imaginings
as
are
cherished
by
the
reprobate
how
grievous
the
charges
brought
against
him
how
severe
the
persecutions
inflicted
upon
and
persecutions
the
like
of
which
men
have
neither
seen
nor
heard
great
god
when
the
stream
of
utterance
reached
this
stage
we
beheld
and
lo
the
sweet
savours
of
god
were
being
wafted
from
the
dayspring
of
revelation
and
the
morning
breeze
was
blowing
out
of
the
sheba
of
the
eternal
its
tidings
rejoiced
anew
the
heart
and
imparted
immeasurable
gladness
to
the
soul
it
made
all
things
new
and
brought
unnumbered
and
inestimable
gifts
from
the
unknowable
friend
the
robe
of
human
praise
can
never
hope
to
match
its
noble
stature
and
its
shining
figure
the
mantle
of
utterance
can
never
fit
without
word
it
unfoldeth
the
inner
mysteries
and
without
speech
it
revealeth
the
secrets
of
the
divine
sayings
it
teacheth
lamentation
and
moaning
to
the
nightingales
warbling
upon
the
bough
of
remoteness
and
bereavement
instructeth
them
in
the
art
of
love
s
ways
and
showeth
them
the
secret
of
to
the
flowers
of
the
ridván
of
heavenly
reunion
it
revealeth
the
endearments
of
the
impassioned
lover
and
unveileth
the
charm
of
the
fair
upon
the
anemones
of
the
garden
of
love
it
bestoweth
the
mysteries
of
truth
and
within
the
breasts
of
lovers
it
entrusteth
the
symbols
of
the
innermost
subtleties
at
this
hour
so
liberal
is
the
outpouring
of
its
grace
that
the
holy
spirit
itself
is
envious
it
hath
imparted
to
the
drop
the
waves
of
the
sea
and
endowed
the
mote
with
the
splendour
of
the
sun
so
great
are
the
overflowings
of
its
bounty
that
the
foulest
beetle
hath
sought
the
perfume
of
the
musk
and
the
bat
the
light
of
the
sun
it
hath
quickened
the
dead
with
the
breath
of
life
and
caused
them
to
speed
out
of
the
sepulchres
of
their
mortal
bodies
it
hath
established
the
ignorant
upon
the
seats
of
learning
and
elevated
the
oppressor
to
the
throne
of
justice
the
universe
is
pregnant
with
these
manifold
bounties
awaiting
the
hour
when
the
effects
of
its
unseen
gifts
will
be
made
manifest
in
this
world
when
the
languishing
and
sore
athirst
will
attain
the
living
kawthar
of
their
and
the
erring
wanderer
lost
in
the
wilds
of
remoteness
and
nothingness
will
enter
the
tabernacle
of
life
and
attain
reunion
with
his
heart
s
desire
in
the
soil
of
whose
heart
will
these
holy
seeds
germinate
from
the
garden
of
whose
soul
will
the
blossoms
of
the
invisible
realities
spring
forth
verily
i
say
so
fierce
is
the
blaze
of
the
bush
of
love
burning
in
the
sinai
of
the
heart
that
the
streaming
waters
of
holy
utterance
can
never
quench
its
flame
oceans
can
never
allay
this
leviathan
s
burning
thirst
and
this
phoenix
of
the
undying
fire
can
abide
nowhere
save
in
the
glow
of
the
countenance
of
the
therefore
o
brother
kindle
with
the
oil
of
wisdom
the
lamp
of
the
spirit
within
the
innermost
chamber
of
thy
heart
and
guard
it
with
the
globe
of
understanding
that
the
breath
of
the
infidel
may
extinguish
not
its
flame
nor
dim
its
brightness
thus
have
we
illuminated
the
heavens
of
utterance
with
the
splendours
of
the
sun
of
divine
wisdom
and
understanding
that
thy
heart
may
find
peace
that
thou
mayest
be
of
those
who
on
the
wings
of
certitude
have
soared
unto
the
heaven
of
the
love
of
their
lord
the
and
now
concerning
his
words
and
then
shall
appear
the
sign
of
the
son
of
man
in
by
these
words
it
is
meant
that
when
the
sun
of
the
heavenly
teachings
hath
been
eclipsed
the
stars
of
the
laws
have
fallen
and
the
moon
of
true
educator
of
been
obscured
when
the
standards
of
guidance
and
felicity
have
been
reversed
and
the
morn
of
truth
and
righteousness
hath
sunk
in
night
then
shall
the
sign
of
the
son
of
man
appear
in
heaven
by

is
meant
the
visible
heaven
inasmuch
as
when
the
hour
draweth
nigh
on
which
the
of
the
heaven
of
justice
shall
be
made
manifest
and
the
ark
of
divine
guidance
shall
sail
upon
the
sea
of
glory
a
star
will
appear
in
the
heaven
heralding
unto
its
people
the
advent
of
that
most
great
light
in
like
manner
in
the
invisible
heaven
a
star
shall
be
made
manifest
who
unto
the
peoples
of
the
earth
shall
act
as
a
harbinger
of
the
break
of
that
true
and
exalted
morn
these
twofold
signs
in
the
visible
and
the
invisible
heaven
have
announced
the
revelation
of
each
of
the
prophets
of
god
as
is
commonly
believed
among
the
prophets
was
abraham
the
friend
of
god
ere
he
manifested
himself
nimrod
dreamed
a
dream
thereupon
he
summoned
the
soothsayers
who
informed
him
of
the
rise
of
a
star
in
the
heaven
likewise
there
appeared
a
herald
who
announced
throughout
the
land
the
coming
of
abraham
after
him
came
moses
he
who
held
converse
with
god
the
soothsayers
of
his
time
warned
pharaoh
in
these
terms
a
star
hath
risen
in
the
heaven
and
lo
it
foreshadoweth
the
conception
of
a
child
who
holdeth
your
fate
and
the
fate
of
your
people
in
his
in
like
manner
there
appeared
a
sage
who
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
brought
tidings
of
joy
unto
the
people
of
israel
imparting
consolation
to
their
souls
and
assurance
to
their
hearts
to
this
testify
the
records
of
the
sacred
books
were
the
details
to
be
mentioned
this
epistle
would
swell
into
a
book
moreover
it
is
not
our
wish
to
relate
the
stories
of
the
days
that
are
past
god
is
our
witness
that
what
we
even
now
mention
is
due
solely
to
our
tender
affection
for
thee
that
haply
the
poor
of
the
earth
may
attain
the
shores
of
the
sea
of
wealth
the
ignorant
be
led
unto
the
ocean
of
divine
knowledge
and
they
that
thirst
for
understanding
partake
of
the
salsabíl
of
divine
wisdom
otherwise
this
servant
regardeth
the
consideration
of
such
records
a
grave
mistake
and
a
grievous
transgression
in
like
manner
when
the
hour
of
the
revelation
of
jesus
drew
nigh
a
few
of
the
magi
aware
that
the
star
of
jesus
had
appeared
in
heaven
sought
and
followed
it
till
they
came
unto
the
city
which
was
the
seat
of
the
kingdom
of
herod
the
sway
of
his
sovereignty
in
those
days
embraced
the
whole
of
that
land
these
magi
said
where
is
he
that
is
born
king
of
the
jews
for
we
have
seen
his
star
in
the
east
and
are
come
to
worship
him
when
they
had
searched
they
found
out
that
in
bethlehem
in
the
land
of
judea
the
child
had
been
born
this
was
the
sign
that
was
manifested
in
the
visible
heaven
as
to
the
sign
in
the
invisible
heaven
of
divine
knowledge
and
was
yaḥyá
son
of
zachariah
who
gave
unto
the
people
the
tidings
of
the
manifestation
of
jesus
even
as
he
hath
revealed
god
announceth
yaḥyá
to
thee
who
shall
bear
witness
unto
the
word
from
god
and
a
great
one
and
by
the
term
word
is
meant
jesus
whose
coming
yaḥyá
foretold
moreover
in
the
heavenly
scriptures
it
is
written
john
the
baptist
was
preaching
in
the
wilderness
of
judea
and
saying
repent
ye
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
by
john
is
meant
yaḥyá
likewise
ere
the
beauty
of
muḥammad
was
unveiled
the
signs
of
the
visible
heaven
were
made
manifest
as
to
the
signs
of
the
invisible
heaven
there
appeared
four
men
who
successively
announced
unto
the
people
the
joyful
tidings
of
the
rise
of
that
divine
luminary
later
named
salmán
was
honoured
by
being
in
their
service
as
the
end
of
one
of
these
approached
he
would
send
unto
the
other
until
the
fourth
who
feeling
his
death
to
be
nigh
addressed
saying
o
when
thou
hast
taken
up
my
body
and
buried
it
go
to
ḥijáz
for
there
the
of
muḥammad
will
arise
happy
art
thou
for
thou
shalt
behold
his
face
and
now
concerning
this
wondrous
and
most
exalted
cause
know
thou
verily
that
many
an
astronomer
hath
announced
the
appearance
of
its
star
in
the
visible
heaven
likewise
there
appeared
on
earth
aḥmad
and
kázim
those
twin
resplendent
god
sanctify
their
from
all
that
we
have
stated
it
hath
become
clear
and
manifest
that
before
the
revelation
of
each
of
the
mirrors
reflecting
the
divine
essence
the
signs
heralding
their
advent
must
needs
be
revealed
in
the
visible
heaven
as
well
as
in
the
invisible
wherein
is
the
seat
of
the
sun
of
knowledge
of
the
moon
of
wisdom
and
of
the
stars
of
understanding
and
utterance
the
sign
of
the
invisible
heaven
must
needs
be
revealed
in
the
person
of
that
perfect
man
who
before
each
manifestation
appeareth
educateth
and
prepareth
the
souls
of
men
for
the
advent
of
the
divine
luminary
the
light
of
the
unity
of
god
amongst
men
and
now
with
reference
to
his
words
and
then
shall
all
the
tribes
of
the
earth
mourn
and
they
shall
see
the
son
of
man
coming
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
with
power
and
great
these
words
signify
that
in
those
days
men
will
lament
the
loss
of
the
sun
of
the
divine
beauty
of
the
moon
of
knowledge
and
of
the
stars
of
divine
wisdom
thereupon
they
will
behold
the
countenance
of
the
promised
one
the
adored
beauty
descending
from
heaven
and
riding
upon
the
clouds
by
this
is
meant
that
the
divine
beauty
will
be
made
manifest
from
the
heaven
of
the
will
of
god
and
will
appear
in
the
form
of
the
human
temple
the
term
heaven
denoteth
loftiness
and
exaltation
inasmuch
as
it
is
the
seat
of
the
revelation
of
those
manifestations
of
holiness
the
of
ancient
glory
these
ancient
beings
though
delivered
from
the
womb
of
their
mother
have
in
reality
descended
from
the
heaven
of
the
will
of
god
though
they
be
dwelling
on
this
earth
yet
their
true
habitations
are
the
retreats
of
glory
in
the
realms
above
whilst
walking
amongst
mortals
they
soar
in
the
heaven
of
the
divine
presence
without
feet
they
tread
the
path
of
the
spirit
and
without
wings
they
rise
unto
the
exalted
heights
of
divine
unity
with
every
fleeting
breath
they
cover
the
immensity
of
space
and
at
every
moment
traverse
the
kingdoms
of
the
visible
and
the
invisible
upon
their
thrones

written
nothing
whatsoever
keepeth
him
from
being
occupied
with
any
other
thing
and
on
their
seats
is
inscribed
verily
his
ways
differ
every

are
sent
forth
through
the
transcendent
power
of
the
ancient
of
days
and
are
raised
up
by
the
exalted
will
of
god
the
most
mighty
king
this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
words
coming
in
the
clouds
of
in
the
utterances
of
the
divine
luminaries
the
term
heaven
hath
been
applied
to
many
and
divers
things
such
as
the
heaven
of
command
the
heaven
of
will
the
heaven
of
the
divine
purpose
the
heaven
of
divine
knowledge
the
heaven
of
certitude
the
heaven
of
utterance
the
heaven
of
revelation
the
heaven
of
concealment
and
the
like
in
every
instance
he
hath
given
the
term
heaven
a
special
meaning
the
significance
of
which
is
revealed
to
none
save
those
that
have
been
initiated
into
the
divine
mysteries
and
have
drunk
from
the
chalice
of
immortal
life
for
example

saith
the
heaven

sustenance
for
you
and
it
containeth
that
which
you
are
promised
whereas
it
is
the
earth
that
yieldeth
such
sustenance
likewise
it
hath
been
said
the
names
come
down
from
heaven
whereas
they
proceed
out
of
the
mouth
of
men
wert
thou
to
cleanse
the
mirror
of
thy
heart
from
the
dust
of
malice
thou
wouldst
apprehend
the
meaning
of
the
symbolic
terms
revealed
by
the
word
of
god
made
manifest
in
every
dispensation
and
wouldst
discover
the
mysteries
of
divine
knowledge
not
however
until
thou
consumest
with
the
flame
of
utter
detachment
those
veils
of
idle
learning
that
are
current
amongst
men
canst
thou
behold
the
resplendent
morn
of
true
knowledge
know
verily
that
knowledge
is
of
two
kinds
divine
and
satanic
the
one
welleth
out
from
the
fountain
of
divine
inspiration
the
other
is
but
a
reflection
of
vain
and
obscure
thoughts
the
source
of
the
former
is
god
himself
the
of
the
latter
the
whisperings
of
selfish
desire
the
one
is
guided
by
the
principle
fear
ye
god
god
will
teach
you
the
other
is
but
a
confirmation
of
the
truth
knowledge
is
the
most
grievous
veil
between
man
and
his
the
former
bringeth
forth
the
fruit
of
patience
of
longing
desire
of
true
understanding
and
love
whilst
the
latter
can
yield
naught
but
arrogance
vainglory
and
conceit
from
the
sayings
of
those
masters
of
holy
utterance
who
have
expounded
the
meaning
of
true
knowledge
the
odour
of
these
dark
teachings
which
have
obscured
the
world
can
in
no
wise
be
detected
the
tree
of
such
teachings
can
yield
no
result
except
iniquity
and
rebellion
and
beareth
no
fruit
but
hatred
and
envy
its
fruit
is
deadly
poison
its
shadow
a
consuming
fire
how
well
hath
it
been
said
cling
unto
the
robe
of
the
desire
of
thy
heart
and
put
thou
away
all
shame
bid
the
worldlywise
be
gone
however
great
their
the
heart
must
needs
therefore
be
cleansed
from
the
idle
sayings
of
men
and
sanctified
from
every
earthly
affection
so
that
it
may
discover
the
hidden
meaning
of
divine
inspiration
and
become
the
treasury
of
the
mysteries
of
divine
knowledge
thus
hath
it
been
said
he
that
treadeth
the
path
and
followeth
in
the
footsteps
of
the
crimson
pillar
shall
never
attain
unto
his
abode
unless
his
hands
are
empty
of
those
worldly
things
cherished
by
this
is
the
prime
requisite
of
whosoever
treadeth
this
path
ponder
thereon
that
with
eyes
unveiled
thou
mayest
perceive
the
truth
of
these
words
we
have
digressed
from
the
purpose
of
our
argument
although
whatsoever
is
mentioned
serveth
only
to
confirm
our
purpose
by
god
however
great
our
desire
to
be
brief
yet
we
feel
we
can
not
restrain
our
pen
notwithstanding
all
that
we
have
mentioned
how
innumerable
are
the
pearls
which
have
remained
unpierced
in
the
shell
of
our
heart
how
many
the
húrís
of
inner
meaning
that
are
as
yet
concealed
within
the
chambers
of
divine
wisdom
none
hath
yet
approached
them
whom
no
man
nor
spirit
hath
touched
notwithstanding
all
that
hath
been
said
it
seemeth
as
if
not
one
letter
of
our
purpose
hath
been
uttered
nor
a
single
sign
divulged
concerning
our
object
when
will
a
faithful
seeker
be
found
who
will
don
the
garb
of
pilgrimage
attain
the
ka
bih
of
the
heart
s
desire
and
without
ear
or
tongue
discover
the
mysteries
of
divine
utterance
by
these
luminous
these
conclusive
and
lucid
statements
the
meaning
of
heaven
in
the
aforementioned
verse
hath
thus
been
made
clear
and
evident
and
now
regarding
his
words
that
the
son
of
man
shall
come
in
the
clouds
of
by
the
term
clouds
is
meant
those
things
that
are
contrary
to
the
ways
and
desires
of
men
even
as
he
hath
revealed
in
the
verse
already
quoted
as
oft
as
an
apostle
cometh
unto
you
with
that
which
your
souls
desire
not
ye
swell
with
pride
accusing
some
of
being
impostors
and
slaying
these
clouds
signify
in
one
sense
the
annulment
of
laws
the
abrogation
of
former
dispensations
the
repeal
of
rituals
and
customs
current
amongst
men
the
exalting
of
the
illiterate
faithful
above
the
learned
opposers
of
the
faith
in
another
sense
they
mean
the
appearance
of
that
immortal
beauty
in
the
image
of
mortal
man
with
such
human
limitations
as
eating
and
drinking
poverty
and
riches
glory
and
abasement
sleeping
and
waking
and
such
other
things
as
cast
doubt
in
the
minds
of
men
and
cause
them
to
turn
away
all
such
veils
are
symbolically
referred
to
as
these
are
the
clouds
that
cause
the
heavens
of
the
knowledge
and
understanding
of
all
that
dwell
on
earth
to
be
cloven
asunder
even
as
he
hath
revealed
on
that
day
shall
the
heaven
be
cloven
by
the
even
as
the
clouds
prevent
the
eyes
of
men
from
beholding
the
sun
so
do
these
things
hinder
the
souls
of
men
from
recognizing
the
light
of
the
divine
luminary
to
this
beareth
witness
that
which
hath
proceeded
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
unbelievers
as
revealed
in
the
sacred
book
and
they
have
said
what
manner
of
apostle
is
this
he
eateth
food
and
walketh
the
streets
unless
an
angel
be
sent
down
and
take
part
in
his
warnings
we
will
not
other
prophets
similarly
have
been
subject
to
poverty
and
afflictions
to
hunger
and
to
the
ills
and
chances
of
this
world
as
these
holy
persons
were
subject
to
such
needs
and
wants
the
people
were
consequently
lost
in
the
wilds
of
misgivings
and
doubts
and
were
afflicted
with
bewilderment
and
perplexity
how
they
wondered
could
such
a
person
be
sent
down
from
god
assert
his
ascendancy
over
all
the
peoples
and
kindreds
of
the
earth
and
claim
himself
to
be
the
goal
of
all
creation
as
he
hath
said
but
for
thee
i
would
not
have
created
all
that
are
in
heaven
and
on
earth
yet
be
subject
to
such
trivial
things
you
must
undoubtedly
have
been
informed
of
the
tribulations
the
poverty
the
ills
and
the
degradation
that
have
befallen
every
prophet
of
god
and
his
companions
you
must
have
heard
how
the
heads
of
their
followers
were
sent
as
presents
unto
different
cities
how
grievously
they
were
hindered
from
that
whereunto
they
were
commanded
each
and
every
one
of
them
fell
a
prey
to
the
hands
of
the
enemies
of
his
cause
and
had
to
suffer
whatsoever
they
decreed
it
is
evident
that
the
changes
brought
about
in
every
dispensation
constitute
the
dark
clouds
that
intervene
between
the
eye
of
man
s
understanding
and
the
divine
luminary
which
shineth
forth
from
the
dayspring
of
the
divine
essence
consider
how
men
for
generations
have
been
blindly
imitating
their
fathers
and
have
been
trained
according
to
such
ways
and
manners
as
have
been
laid
down
by
the
dictates
of
their
faith
were
these
men
therefore
to
discover
suddenly
that
a
man
who
hath
been
living
in
their
midst
who
with
respect
to
every
human
limitation
hath
been
their
equal
had
risen
to
abolish
every
established
principle
imposed
by
their
by
which
for
centuries
they
have
been
disciplined
and
every
opposer
and
denier
of
which
they
have
come
to
regard
as
infidel
profligate
and
wicked
would
of
a
certainty
be
veiled
and
hindered
from
acknowledging
his
truth
such
things
are
as
clouds
that
veil
the
eyes
of
those
whose
inner
being
hath
not
tasted
the
salsabíl
of
detachment
nor
drunk
from
the
kawthar
of
the
knowledge
of
god
such
men
when
acquainted
with
these
circumstances
become
so
veiled
that
without
the
least
question
they
pronounce
the
manifestation
of
god
an
infidel
and
sentence
him
to
death
you
must
have
heard
of
such
things
taking
place
all
down
the
ages
and
are
now
observing
them
in
these
days
it
behooveth
us
therefore
to
make
the
utmost
endeavour
that
by
god
s
invisible
assistance
these
dark
veils
these
clouds
of
trials
may
not
hinder
us
from
beholding
the
beauty
of
his
shining
countenance
and
that
we
may
recognize
him
only
by
his
own
self
and
should
we
ask
for
a
testimony
of
his
truth
we
should
content
ourselves
with
one
and
only
one
that
thereby
we
may
attain
unto
him
who
is
the
of
infinite
grace
and
in
whose
presence
all
the
world
s
abundance
fadeth
into
nothingness
that
we
may
cease
to
cavil
at
him
every
day
and
to
cleave
unto
our
own
idle
fancy
gracious
god
notwithstanding
the
warning
which
in
marvelously
symbolic
language
and
subtle
allusions
hath
been
uttered
in
days
past
and
which
was
intended
to
awaken
the
peoples
of
the
world
and
to
prevent
them
from
being
deprived
of
their
share
of
the
billowing
ocean
of
god
s
grace
yet
such
things
as
have
already
been
witnessed
have
come
to
pass
reference
to
these
things
hath
also
been
made
in
the
qur
án
as
witnessed
by
this
verse
what
can
such
expect
but
that
god
should
come
down
to
them
overshadowed
with
clouds
a
number
of
the
divines
who
hold
firmly
to
the
letter
of
the
word
of
god
have
come
to
regard
this
verse
as
one
of
the
signs
of
that
expected
resurrection
which
is
born
of
their
idle
fancy
this
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
similar
references
have
been
made
in
most
of
the
heavenly
books
and
have
been
recorded
in
all
the
passages
connected
with
the
signs
of
the
coming
manifestation
likewise
he
saith
on
the
day
when
the
heaven
shall
give
out
a
palpable
smoke
which
shall
enshroud
mankind
this
will
be
an
afflictive
the
hath
decreed
these
very
things
that
are
contrary
to
the
desires
of
wicked
men
to
be
the
touchstone
and
standard
whereby
he
proveth
his
servants
that
the
just
may
be
known
from
the
wicked
and
the
faithful
distinguished
from
the
infidel
the
symbolic
term
smoke
denotes
grave
dissensions
the
abrogation
and
demolition
of
recognized
standards
and
the
utter
destruction
of
their
exponents
what
smoke
more
dense
and
overpowering
than
the
one
which
hath
now
enshrouded
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
which
hath
become
a
torment
unto
them
and
from
which
they
hopelessly
fail
to
deliver
themselves
however
much
they
strive
so
fierce
is
this
fire
of
self
burning
within
them
that
at
every
moment
they
seem
to
be
afflicted
with
fresh
torments
the
more
they
are
told
that
this
wondrous
cause
of
god
this
revelation
from
the
most
high
hath
been
made
manifest
to
all
mankind
and
is
waxing
greater
and
stronger
every
day
the
fiercer
groweth
the
blaze
of
the
fire
in
their
hearts
the
more
they
observe
the
indomitable
strength
the
sublime
renunciation
the
unwavering
constancy
of
god
s
holy
companions
who
by
the
aid
of
god
are
growing
nobler
and
more
glorious
every
day
the
deeper
the
dismay
which
ravageth
their
souls
in
these
days
praise
be
to
god
the
power
of
his
word
hath
obtained
such
ascendancy
over
men
that
they
dare
breathe
no
word
were
they
to
encounter
one
of
the
companions
of
god
who
if
he
could
would
freely
and
joyously
offer
up
ten
thousand
lives
as
a
sacrifice
for
his
beloved
so
great
would
be
their
fear
that
they
forthwith
would
profess
their
faith
in
him
whilst
privily
they
would
vilify
and
execrate
his
name
even
as
he
hath
revealed
and
when
they
meet
you
they
say
we
believe
but
when
they
are
apart
they
bite
their
fingers
ends
at
you
out
of
wrath
say
die
in
your
wrath
god
truly
knoweth
the
very
recesses
of
your
ere
long
thine
eyes
will
behold
the
standards
of
divine
power
unfurled
throughout
all
regions
and
the
signs
of
his
triumphant
might
and
sovereignty
manifest
in
every
land
as
most
of
the
divines
have
failed
to
apprehend
the
meaning
of
these
verses
and
have
not
grasped
the
significance
of
the
day
of
resurrection
they
therefore
have
foolishly
interpreted
these
verses
according
to
their
idle
and
faulty
conception
the
one
true
god
is
my
witness
little
perception
is
required
to
enable
them
to
gather
from
the
symbolic
language
of
these
two
verses
all
that
we
have
purposed
to
propound
and
thus
to
attain
through
the
grace
of
the
the
resplendent
morn
of
certitude
such
are
the
strains
of
celestial
melody
which
the
immortal
bird
of
heaven
warbling
upon
the
sadrih
of
bahá
poureth
out
upon
thee
that
by
the
permission
of
god
thou
mayest
tread
the
path
of
divine
knowledge
and
wisdom
and
now
concerning
his
words
and
he
shall
send
his
angels
by
angels
is
meant
those
who
reinforced
by
the
power
of
the
spirit
have
consumed
with
the
fire
of
the
love
of
god
all
human
traits
and
limitations
and
have
clothed
themselves
with
the
attributes
of
the
most
exalted
beings
and
of
the
cherubim
that
holy
man
ṣádiq
in
his
eulogy
of
the
cherubim
saith
there
stand
a
company
of
our
ihs
behind
the
divers
and
manifold
are
the
interpretations
of
the
words
behind
the
in
one
sense
they
indicate
that
no
true
ihs
exist
even
as
he
hath
said
in
another
passage
a
true
believer
is
likened
unto
the
philosopher
s
addressing
subsequently
his
listener
he
saith
hast
thou
ever
seen
the
philosopher
s
stone
reflect
how
this
symbolic
language
more
eloquent
than
any
speech
however
direct
testifieth
to
the
of
a
true
believer
such
is
the
testimony
of
ṣádiq
and
now
consider
how
unfair
and
numerous
are
those
who
although
they
themselves
have
failed
to
inhale
the
fragrance
of
belief
have
condemned
as
infidels
those
by
whose
word
belief
itself
is
recognized
and
established
and
now
inasmuch
as
these
holy
beings
have
sanctified
themselves
from
every
human
limitation
have
become
endowed
with
the
attributes
of
the
spiritual
and
have
been
adorned
with
the
noble
traits
of
the
blessed
they
therefore
have
been
designated
as
such
is
the
meaning
of
these
verses
every
word
of
which
hath
been
expounded
by
the
aid
of
the
most
lucid
texts
the
most
convincing
arguments
and
the
best
established
evidences
as
the
adherents
of
jesus
have
never
understood
the
hidden
meaning
of
these
words
and
as
the
signs
which
they
and
the
leaders
of
their
faith
have
expected
have
failed
to
appear
they
therefore
refused
to
acknowledge
even
until
now
the
truth
of
those
manifestations
of
holiness
that
have
since
the
days
of
jesus
been
made
manifest
they
have
thus
deprived
themselves
of
the
outpourings
of
god
s
holy
grace
and
of
the
wonders
of
his
divine
utterance
such
is
their
low
estate
in
this
the
day
of
resurrection
they
have
even
failed
to
perceive
that
were
the
signs
of
the
manifestation
of
god
in
every
age
to
appear
in
the
visible
realm
in
accordance
with
the
text
of
established
traditions
none
could
possibly
deny
or
turn
away
nor
would
the
blessed
be
distinguished
from
the
miserable
and
the
transgressor
from
the
judge
fairly
were
the
prophecies
recorded
in
the
gospel
to
be
literally
fulfilled
were
jesus
son
of
mary
accompanied
by
angels
to
descend
from
the
visible
heaven
upon
the
clouds
who
would
dare
to
disbelieve
who
would
dare
to
reject
the
truth
and
wax
disdainful
nay
such
consternation
would
immediately
seize
all
the
dwellers
of
the
earth
that
no
soul
would
feel
able
to
utter
a
word
much
less
to
reject
or
accept
the
truth
it
was
owing
to
their
misunderstanding
of
these
truths
that
many
a
christian
divine
hath
objected
to
muḥammad
and
voiced
his
protest
in
such
words
if
thou
art
in
truth
the
promised
prophet
why
then
art
thou
not
accompanied
by
those
angels
our
sacred
books
foretold
and
which
must
needs
descend
with
the
promised
beauty
to
assist
him
in
his
revelation
and
act
as
warners
unto
his
people
even
as
the
hath
recorded
their
statement
why
hath
not
an
angel
been
sent
down
to
him
so
that
he
should
have
been
a
warner
with
him
such
objections
and
differences
have
persisted
in
every
age
and
century
the
people
have
always
busied
themselves
with
such
specious
discourses
vainly
protesting
wherefore
hath
not
this
or
that
sign
appeared
such
ills
befell
them
only
because
they
have
clung
to
the
ways
of
the
divines
of
the
age
in
which
they
lived
and
blindly
imitated
them
in
accepting
or
denying
these
essences
of
detachment
these
holy
and
divine
beings
these
leaders
owing
to
their
immersion
in
selfish
desires
and
their
pursuit
of
transitory
and
sordid
things
have
regarded
these
divine
luminaries
as
being
opposed
to
the
standards
of
their
knowledge
and
understanding
and
the
opponents
of
their
ways
and
judgments
as
they
have
literally
interpreted
the
word
of
god
and
the
sayings
and
traditions
of
the
letters
of
unity
and
expounded
them
according
to
their
own
deficient
understanding
they
have
therefore
deprived
themselves
and
all
their
people
of
the
bountiful
showers
of
the
grace
and
mercies
of
god
and
yet
they
bear
witness
to
this
tradition
verily
our
word
is
abstruse
bewilderingly
in
another
instance
it
is
said
our
cause
is
sorely
trying
highly
perplexing
none
can
bear
it
except
a
favorite
of
heaven
or
an
inspired
prophet
or
he
whose
faith
god
hath
these
leaders
of
religion
admit
that
none
of
these
three
specified
conditions
is
applicable
to
them
the
first
two
conditions
are
manifestly
beyond
their
reach
as
to
the
third
it
is
evident
that
at
no
time
have
they
been
proof
against
those
tests
that
have
been
sent
by
god
and
that
when
the
divine
touchstone
appeared
they
have
shown
themselves
to
be
naught
but
dross
great
god
notwithstanding
their
acceptance
of
the
truth
of
this
tradition
these
divines
who
are
still
doubtful
of
and
dispute
about
the
theological
obscurities
of
their
faith
yet
claim
to
be
the
exponents
of
the
subtleties
of
the
law
of
god
and
the
expounders
of
the
essential
mysteries
of
his
holy
word
they
confidently
assert
that
such
traditions
as
indicate
the
advent
of
the
expected
qá
im
have
not
yet
been
fulfilled
whilst
they
themselves
have
failed
to
inhale
the
fragrance
of
the
meaning
of
these
traditions
and
are
still
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
all
the
signs
foretold
have
come
to
pass
that
the
way
of
god
s
holy
cause
hath
been
revealed
and
the
concourse
of
the
faithful
swift
as
lightning
are
even
now
passing
upon
that
way
whilst
these
foolish
divines
wait
expecting
to
witness
the
signs
foretold
say
o
ye
foolish
ones
wait
ye
even
as
those
before
you
are
waiting
were
they
to
be
questioned
concerning
those
signs
that
must
needs
herald
the
revelation
and
rise
of
the
sun
of
the
muḥammadan
dispensation
to
which
we
have
already
referred
none
of
which
have
been
literally
fulfilled
and
were
it
to
be
said
to
them
wherefore
have
ye
rejected
the
claims
advanced
by
christians
and
the
peoples
of
other
faiths
and
regard
them
as
infidels
knowing
not
what
answer
to
give
they
will
reply
these
books
have
been
corrupted
and
are
not
and
never
have
been
of
reflect
the
words
of
the
verses
themselves
eloquently
testify
to
the
truth
that
they
are
of
god
a
similar
verse
hath
been
also
revealed
in
the
qur
án
were
ye
of
them
that
comprehend
verily
i
say
throughout
all
this
period
they
have
utterly
failed
to
comprehend
what
is
meant
by
corrupting
the
text
yea
in
the
writings
and
utterances
of
the
mirrors
reflecting
the
sun
of
the
muḥammadan
dispensation
mention
hath
been
made
of
modification
by
the
exalted
beings
and
alteration
by
the
such
passages
however
refer
only
to
particular
cases
among
them
is
the
story
of
when
the
people
of
asked
the
focal
center
of
the
muḥammadan
revelation
concerning
the
penalty
of
adultery
committed
between
a
married
man
and
a
married
woman
muḥammad
answered
and
said
the
law
of
god
is
death
by
whereupon
they
protested
saying
no
such
law
hath
been
revealed
in
the
muḥammad
answered
and
said
whom
do
ye
regard
among
your
rabbis
as
being
a
recognized
authority
and
having
a
sure
knowledge
of
the
truth
they
agreed
upon
thereupon
muḥammad
summoned
him
and
said
i
adjure
thee
by
god
who
clove
the
sea
for
you
caused
manna
to
descend
upon
you
and
the
cloud
to
overshadow
you
who
delivered
you
from
pharaoh
and
his
people
and
exalted
you
above
all
human
beings
to
tell
us
what
moses
hath
decreed
concerning
adultery
between
a
married
man
and
a
married
he
made
reply
o
muḥammad
death
by
stoning
is
the
muḥammad
observed
why
is
it
then
that
this
law
is
annulled
and
hath
ceased
to
operate
among
the
jews
he
answered
and
said
when
nebuchadnezzar
delivered
jerusalem
to
the
flames
and
put
the
jews
to
death
only
a
few
survived
the
divines
of
that
age
considering
the
extremely
limited
number
of
the
jews
and
the
multitude
of
the
amalekites
took
counsel
together
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
were
they
to
enforce
the
law
of
the
pentateuch
every
survivor
who
hath
been
delivered
from
the
hand
of
nebuchadnezzar
would
have
to
be
put
to
death
according
to
the
verdict
of
the
book
owing
to
such
considerations
they
totally
repealed
the
penalty
of
meanwhile
gabriel
inspired
muḥammad
s
illumined
heart
with
these
words
they
pervert
the
text
of
the
word
of
this
is
one
of
the
instances
that
have
been
referred
to
verily
by
perverting
the
text
is
not
meant
that
which
these
foolish
and
abject
souls
have
fancied
even
as
some
maintain
that
jewish
and
christian
divines
have
effaced
from
the
book
such
verses
as
extol
and
magnify
the
countenance
of
muḥammad
and
instead
thereof
have
inserted
the
contrary
how
utterly
vain
and
false
are
these
words
can
a
man
who
believeth
in
a
book
and
deemeth
it
to
be
inspired
by
god
mutilate
it
moreover
the
pentateuch
had
been
spread
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
was
not
confined
to
mecca
and
medina
so
that
they
could
privily
corrupt
and
pervert
its
text
nay
rather
by
corruption
of
the
text
is
meant
that
in
which
all
muslim
divines
are
engaged
today
that
is
the
interpretation
of
god
s
holy
book
in
accordance
with
their
idle
imaginings
and
vain
desires
and
as
the
jews
in
the
time
of
muḥammad
interpreted
those
verses
of
the
pentateuch
that
referred
to
his
manifestation
after
their
own
fancy
and
refused
to
be
satisfied
with
his
holy
utterance
the
charge
of
perverting
the
text
was
therefore
pronounced
against
them
likewise
it
is
clear
how
in
this
day
the
people
of
the
qur
án
have
perverted
the
text
of
god
s
holy
book
concerning
the
signs
of
the
expected
manifestation
and
interpreted
it
according
to
their
inclination
and
desires
in
yet
another
instance
he
saith
a
part
of
them
heard
the
word
of
god
and
then
after
they
had
understood
it
distorted
it
and
knew
that
they
did
this
verse
too
doth
indicate
that
the
meaning
of
the
word
of
god
hath
been
perverted
not
that
the
actual
words
have
been
effaced
to
the
truth
of
this
testify
they
that
are
sound
of
mind
again
in
another
instance
he
saith
woe
unto
those
who
with
their
own
hands
transcribe
the
book
corruptly
and
then
say
this
is
from
god
that
they
may
sell
it
for
some
mean
this
verse
was
revealed
with
reference
to
the
divines
and
leaders
of
the
jewish
faith
these
divines
in
order
to
please
the
rich
acquire
worldly
emoluments
and
give
vent
to
their
envy
and
misbelief
wrote
a
number
of
treatises
refuting
the
claims
of
muḥammad
supporting
their
arguments
with
such
evidences
as
it
would
be
improper
to
mention
and
claimed
that
these
arguments
were
derived
from
the
text
of
the
pentateuch
the
same
may
be
witnessed
today
consider
how
abundant
are
the
denunciations
written
by
the
foolish
divines
of
this
age
against
this
most
wondrous
cause
how
vain
their
imaginings
that
these
calumnies
are
in
conformity
with
the
verses
of
god
s
sacred
book
and
in
consonance
with
the
utterances
of
men
of
discernment
our
purpose
in
relating
these
things
is
to
warn
you
that
were
they
to
maintain
that
those
verses
wherein
the
signs
referred
to
in
the
gospel
are
mentioned
have
been
perverted
were
they
to
reject
them
and
cling
instead
to
other
verses
and
traditions
you
should
know
that
their
words
were
utter
falsehood
and
sheer
calumny
yea
corruption
of
the
text
in
the
sense
we
have
referred
to
hath
been
actually
effected
in
particular
instances
a
few
of
these
we
have
mentioned
that
it
may
become
manifest
to
every
discerning
observer
that
unto
a
few
untutored
holy
men
hath
been
given
the
mastery
of
human
learning
so
that
the
malevolent
opposer
may
cease
to
contend
that
a
certain
verse
doth
indicate
corruption
of
the
text
and
insinuate
that
we
through
lack
of
knowledge
have
made
mention
of
such
things
moreover
most
of
the
verses
that
indicate
corruption
of
the
text
have
been
revealed
with
reference
to
the
jewish
people
were
ye
to
explore
the
isles
of
qur
ánic
revelation
we
have
also
heard
a
number
of
the
foolish
of
the
earth
assert
that
the
genuine
text
of
the
heavenly
gospel
doth
not
exist
amongst
the
christians
that
it
hath
ascended
unto
heaven
how
grievously
they
have
erred
how
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
such
a
statement
imputeth
the
gravest
injustice
and
tyranny
to
a
gracious
and
loving
providence
how
could
god
when
once
the
of
the
beauty
of
jesus
had
disappeared
from
the
sight
of
his
people
and
ascended
unto
the
fourth
heaven
cause
his
holy
book
his
most
great
testimony
amongst
his
creatures
to
disappear
also
what
would
be
left
to
that
people
to
cling
to
from
the
setting
of
the
of
jesus
until
the
rise
of
the
sun
of
the
muḥammadan
dispensation
what
law
could
be
their
stay
and
guide
how
could
such
people
be
made
the
victims
of
the
avenging
wrath
of
god
the
omnipotent
avenger
how
could
they
be
afflicted
with
the
scourge
of
chastisement
by
the
heavenly
king
above
all
how
could
the
flow
of
the
grace
of
the
be
stayed
how
could
the
ocean
of
his
tender
mercies
be
stilled
we
take
refuge
with
god
from
that
which
his
creatures
have
fancied
about
him
exalted
is
he
above
their
comprehension
dear
friend
now
when
the
light
of
god
s
everlasting
morn
is
breaking
when
the
radiance
of
his
holy
words
god
is
the
light
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
earth
is
shedding
illumination
upon
all
mankind
when
the
inviolability
of
his
tabernacle
is
being
proclaimed
by
his
sacred
utterance
god
hath
willed
to
perfect
his
light
and
the
hand
of
omnipotence
bearing
his
testimony
in
his
grasp
he
holdeth
the
kingdom
of
all
things
is
being
outstretched
unto
all
the
peoples
and
kindreds
of
the
earth
it
behooveth
us
to
gird
up
the
loins
of
endeavour
that
haply
by
the
grace
and
bounty
of
god
we
may
enter
the
celestial
city
verily
we
are
god
s
and
abide
within
the
exalted
habitation
and
unto
him
we
do
it
is
incumbent
upon
thee
by
the
permission
of
god
to
cleanse
the
eye
of
thine
heart
from
the
things
of
the
world
that
thou
mayest
realize
the
infinitude
of
divine
knowledge
and
mayest
behold
truth
so
clearly
that
thou
wilt
need
no
proof
to
demonstrate
his
reality
nor
any
evidence
to
bear
witness
unto
his
testimony
o
affectionate
seeker
shouldst
thou
soar
in
the
holy
realm
of
the
spirit
thou
wouldst
recognize
god
manifest
and
exalted
above
all
things
in
such
wise
that
thine
eyes
would
behold
none
else
but
him
god
was
alone
there
was
none
else
besides
so
lofty
is
this
station
that
no
testimony
can
bear
it
witness
neither
evidence
do
justice
to
its
truth
wert
thou
to
explore
the
sacred
domain
of
truth
thou
wilt
find
that
all
things
are
known
only
by
the
light
of
his
recognition
that
he
hath
ever
been
and
will
continue
for
ever
to
be
known
through
himself
and
if
thou
dwellest
in
the
land
of
testimony
content
thyself
with
that
which
he
himself
hath
revealed
is
it
not
enough
for
them
that
we
have
sent
down
unto
thee
the
book
this
is
the
testimony
which
he
himself
hath
ordained
greater
proof
than
this
there
is
none
nor
ever
will
be
this
proof
is
his
word
his
own
self
the
testimony
of
his
and
now
we
beseech
the
people
of
the
bayán
all
the
learned
the
sages
the
divines
and
witnesses
amongst
them
not
to
forget
the
wishes
and
admonitions
revealed
in
their
book
let
them
at
all
times
fix
their
gaze
upon
the
essentials
of
his
cause
lest
when
he
who
is
the
quintessence
of
truth
the
inmost
reality
of
all
things
the
source
of
all
light
is
made
manifest
they
cling
unto
certain
passages
of
the
book
and
inflict
upon
him
that
which
was
inflicted
in
the
dispensation
of
the
qur
án
for
verily
powerful
is
he
the
king
of
divine
might
to
extinguish
with
one
letter
of
his
wondrous
words
the
breath
of
life
in
the
whole
of
the
bayán
and
the
people
thereof
and
with
one
letter
bestow
upon
them
a
new
and
everlasting
life
and
cause
them
to
arise
and
speed
out
of
the
sepulchres
of
their
vain
and
selfish
desires
take
heed
and
be
watchful
and
remember
that
all
things
have
their
consummation
in
belief
in
him
in
attainment
unto
his
day
and
in
the
realization
of
his
divine
presence
there
is
no
piety
in
turning
your
faces
toward
the
east
or
toward
the
west
but
he
is
pious
who
believeth
in
god
and
the
last
give
ear
o
people
of
the
bayán
unto
the
truth
whereunto
we
have
admonished
you
that
haply
ye
may
seek
the
shelter
of
the
shadow
extended
in
the
day
of
god
upon
all
mankind
end
of
part
one
part
two
he
who
is
the
of
truth
and
revealer
of
the
supreme
being
holdeth
for
all
time
undisputed
sovereignty
over
all
that
is
in
heaven
and
on
earth
though
no
man
be
found
on
earth
to
obey
him
he
verily
is
independent
of
all
earthly
dominion
though
he
be
utterly
destitute
thus
we
reveal
unto
thee
the
mysteries
of
the
cause
of
god
and
bestow
upon
thee
the
gems
of
divine
wisdom
that
haply
thou
mayest
soar
on
the
wings
of
renunciation
to
those
heights
that
are
veiled
from
the
eyes
of
the
significance
and
essential
purpose
underlying
these
words
is
to
reveal
and
demonstrate
unto
the
pure
in
heart
and
the
sanctified
in
spirit
that
they
who
are
the
luminaries
of
truth
and
the
mirrors
reflecting
the
light
of
divine
unity
in
whatever
age
and
cycle
they
are
sent
down
from
their
invisible
habitations
of
ancient
glory
unto
this
world
to
educate
the
souls
of
men
and
endue
with
grace
all
created
things
are
invariably
endowed
with
an
power
and
invested
with
invincible
sovereignty
for
these
hidden
gems
these
concealed
and
invisible
treasures
in
themselves
manifest
and
vindicate
the
reality
of
these
holy
words
verily
god
doeth
whatsoever
he
willeth
and
ordaineth
whatsoever
he
to
every
discerning
and
illumined
heart
it
is
evident
that
god
the
unknowable
essence
the
divine
being
is
immensely
exalted
beyond
every
human
attribute
such
as
corporeal
existence
ascent
and
descent
egress
and
regress
far
be
it
from
his
glory
that
human
tongue
should
adequately
recount
his
praise
or
that
human
heart
comprehend
his
fathomless
mystery
he
is
and
hath
ever
been
veiled
in
the
ancient
eternity
of
his
essence
and
will
remain
in
his
reality
everlastingly
hidden
from
the
sight
of
men
no
vision
taketh
in
him
but
he
taketh
in
all
vision
he
is
the
subtile
the
no
tie
of
direct
intercourse
can
possibly
bind
him
to
his
creatures
he
standeth
exalted
beyond
and
above
all
separation
and
union
all
proximity
and
remoteness
no
sign
can
indicate
his
presence
or
his
absence
inasmuch
as
by
a
word
of
his
command
all
that
are
in
heaven
and
on
earth
have
come
to
exist
and
by
his
wish
which
is
the
primal
will
itself
all
have
stepped
out
of
utter
nothingness
into
the
realm
of
being
the
world
of
the
visible
gracious
god
how
could
there
be
conceived
any
existing
relationship
or
possible
connection
between
his
word
and
they
that
are
created
of
it
the
verse
god
would
have
you
beware
of
himself
unmistakably
beareth
witness
to
the
reality
of
our
argument
and
the
words
god
was
alone
there
was
none
else
besides
him
are
a
sure
testimony
of
its
truth
all
the
prophets
of
god
and
their
chosen
ones
all
the
divines
the
sages
and
the
wise
of
every
generation
unanimously
recognize
their
inability
to
attain
unto
the
comprehension
of
that
quintessence
of
all
truth
and
confess
their
incapacity
to
grasp
him
who
is
the
inmost
reality
of
all
things
the
door
of
the
knowledge
of
the
ancient
of
days
being
thus
closed
in
the
face
of
all
beings
the
source
of
infinite
grace
according
to
his
saying
his
grace
hath
transcended
all
things
my
grace
hath
encompassed
them
all
hath
caused
those
luminous
gems
of
holiness
to
appear
out
of
the
realm
of
the
spirit
in
the
noble
form
of
the
human
temple
and
be
made
manifest
unto
all
men
that
they
may
impart
unto
the
world
the
mysteries
of
the
unchangeable
being
and
tell
of
the
subtleties
of
his
imperishable
essence
these
sanctified
mirrors
these
of
ancient
glory
are
one
and
all
the
exponents
on
earth
of
him
who
is
the
central
orb
of
the
universe
its
essence
and
ultimate
purpose
from
him
proceed
their
knowledge
and
power
from
him
is
derived
their
sovereignty
the
beauty
of
their
countenance
is
but
a
reflection
of
his
image
and
their
revelation
a
sign
of
his
deathless
glory
they
are
the
treasuries
of
divine
knowledge
and
the
repositories
of
celestial
wisdom
through
them
is
transmitted
a
grace
that
is
infinite
and
by
them
is
revealed
the
light
that
can
never
fade
even
as
he
hath
said
there
is
no
distinction
whatsoever
between
thee
and
them
except
that
they
are
thy
servants
and
are
created
of
this
is
the
significance
of
the
tradition
i
am
he
himself
and
he
is
i
the
traditions
and
sayings
that
bear
direct
reference
to
our
theme
are
divers
and
manifold
we
have
refrained
from
quoting
them
for
the
sake
of
brevity
nay
whatever
is
in
the
heavens
and
whatever
is
on
the
earth
is
a
direct
evidence
of
the
revelation
within
it
of
the
attributes
and
names
of
god
inasmuch
as
within
every
atom
are
enshrined
the
signs
that
bear
eloquent
testimony
to
the
revelation
of
that
most
great
light
methinks
but
for
the
potency
of
that
revelation
no
being
could
ever
exist
how
resplendent
the
luminaries
of
knowledge
that
shine
in
an
atom
and
how
vast
the
oceans
of
wisdom
that
surge
within
a
drop
to
a
supreme
degree
is
this
true
of
man
who
among
all
created
things
hath
been
invested
with
the
robe
of
such
gifts
and
hath
been
singled
out
for
the
glory
of
such
distinction
for
in
him
are
potentially
revealed
all
the
attributes
and
names
of
god
to
a
degree
that
no
other
created
being
hath
excelled
or
surpassed
all
these
names
and
attributes
are
applicable
to
him
even
as
he
hath
said
man
is
my
mystery
and
i
am
his
manifold
are
the
verses
that
have
been
repeatedly
revealed
in
all
the
heavenly
books
and
the
holy
scriptures
expressive
of
this
most
subtle
and
lofty
theme
even
as
he
hath
revealed
we
will
surely
show
them
our
signs
in
the
world
and
within
again
he
saith
and
also
in
your
own
selves
will
ye
not
then
behold
the
signs
of
god
and
yet
again
he
revealeth
and
be
ye
not
like
those
who
forget
god
and
whom
he
hath
therefore
caused
to
forget
their
own
in
this
connection
he
who
is
the
eternal
the
souls
of
all
that
dwell
within
the
mystic
tabernacle
be
a
sacrifice
unto
spoken
he
hath
known
god
who
hath
known
i
swear
by
god
o
esteemed
and
honoured
friend
shouldst
thou
ponder
these
words
in
thine
heart
thou
wilt
of
a
certainty
find
the
doors
of
divine
wisdom
and
infinite
knowledge
flung
open
before
thy
face
from
that
which
hath
been
said
it
becometh
evident
that
all
things
in
their
inmost
reality
testify
to
the
revelation
of
the
names
and
attributes
of
god
within
them
each
according
to
its
capacity
indicateth
and
is
expressive
of
the
knowledge
of
god
so
potent
and
universal
is
this
revelation
that
it
hath
encompassed
all
things
visible
and
invisible
thus
hath
he
revealed
hath
aught
else
save
thee
a
power
of
revelation
which
is
not
possessed
by
thee
that
it
could
have
manifested
thee
blind
is
the
eye
which
doth
not
perceive
likewise
hath
the
eternal
king
spoken
no
thing
have
i
perceived
except
that
i
perceived
god
within
it
god
before
it
or
god
after
also
in
the
tradition
of
kumayl
it
is
written
behold
a
light
hath
shone
forth
out
of
the
morn
of
eternity
and
lo
its
waves
have
penetrated
the
inmost
reality
of
all
man
the
noblest
and
most
perfect
of
all
created
things
excelleth
them
all
in
the
intensity
of
this
revelation
and
is
a
fuller
expression
of
its
glory
and
of
all
men
the
most
accomplished
the
most
distinguished
and
the
most
excellent
are
the
manifestations
of
the
sun
of
truth
nay
all
else
besides
these
manifestations
live
by
the
operation
of
their
will
and
move
and
have
their
being
through
the
outpourings
of
their
grace
but
for
thee
i
would
have
not
created
the
nay
all
in
their
holy
presence
fade
into
utter
nothingness
and
are
a
thing
forgotten
human
tongue
can
never
befittingly
sing
their
praise
and
human
speech
can
never
unfold
their
mystery
these
tabernacles
of
holiness
these
primal
mirrors
which
reflect
the
light
of
unfading
glory
are
but
expressions
of
him
who
is
the
invisible
of
the
invisibles
by
the
revelation
of
these
gems
of
divine
virtue
all
the
names
and
attributes
of
god
such
as
knowledge
and
power
sovereignty
and
dominion
mercy
and
wisdom
glory
bounty
and
grace
are
made
manifest
these
attributes
of
god
are
not
and
have
never
been
vouchsafed
specially
unto
certain
prophets
and
withheld
from
others
nay
all
the
prophets
of
god
his
his
holy
and
chosen
messengers
are
without
exception
the
bearers
of
his
names
and
the
embodiments
of
his
attributes
they
only
differ
in
the
intensity
of
their
revelation
and
the
comparative
potency
of
their
light
even
as
he
hath
revealed
some
of
the
apostles
we
have
caused
to
excel
the
it
hath
therefore
become
manifest
and
evident
that
within
the
tabernacles
of
these
prophets
and
chosen
ones
of
god
the
light
of
his
infinite
names
and
exalted
attributes
hath
been
reflected
even
though
the
light
of
some
of
these
attributes
may
or
may
not
be
outwardly
revealed
from
these
luminous
temples
to
the
eyes
of
men
that
a
certain
attribute
of
god
hath
not
been
outwardly
manifested
by
these
essences
of
detachment
doth
in
no
wise
imply
that
they
who
are
the
daysprings
of
god
s
attributes
and
the
treasuries
of
his
holy
names
did
not
actually
possess
it
therefore
these
illuminated
souls
these
beauteous
countenances
have
each
and
every
one
of
them
been
endowed
with
all
the
attributes
of
god
such
as
sovereignty
dominion
and
the
like
even
though
to
outward
seeming
they
be
shorn
of
all
earthly
majesty
to
every
discerning
eye
this
is
evident
and
manifest
it
requireth
neither
proof
nor
evidence
yea
inasmuch
as
the
peoples
of
the
world
have
failed
to
seek
from
the
luminous
and
crystal
springs
of
divine
knowledge
the
inner
meaning
of
god
s
holy
words
they
therefore
have
languished
stricken
and
sore
athirst
in
the
vale
of
idle
fancy
and
waywardness
they
have
strayed
far
from
the
fresh
and
waters
and
gathered
round
the
salt
that
burneth
bitterly
concerning
them
the
dove
of
eternity
hath
spoken
and
if
they
see
the
path
of
righteousness
they
will
not
take
it
for
their
path
but
if
they
see
the
path
of
error
for
their
path
will
they
take
it
this
because
they
treated
our
signs
as
lies
and
were
heedless
of
to
this
testifieth
that
which
hath
been
witnessed
in
this
wondrous
and
exalted
dispensation
myriads
of
holy
verses
have
descended
from
the
heaven
of
might
and
grace
yet
no
one
hath
turned
thereunto
nor
ceased
to
cling
to
those
words
of
men
not
one
letter
of
which
they
that
have
spoken
them
comprehend
for
this
reason
the
people
have
doubted
incontestable
truths
such
as
these
and
caused
themselves
to
be
deprived
of
the
ridván
of
divine
knowledge
and
the
eternal
meads
of
celestial
wisdom
and
now
to
resume
our
argument
concerning
the
question
why
is
it
that
the
sovereignty
of
the
qá
im
affirmed
in
the
text
of
recorded
traditions
and
handed
down
by
the
shining
stars
of
the
muḥammadan
dispensation
hath
not
in
the
least
been
made
manifest
nay
the
contrary
hath
come
to
pass
have
not
his
disciples
and
companions
been
afflicted
of
men
are
they
not
still
the
victims
of
the
fierce
opposition
of
their
enemies
are
they
not
today
leading
the
life
of
abased
and
impotent
mortals
yea
the
sovereignty
attributed
to
the
qá
im
and
spoken
of
in
the
scriptures
is
a
reality
the
truth
of
which
none
can
doubt
this
sovereignty
however
is
not
the
sovereignty
which
the
minds
of
men
have
falsely
imagined
moreover
the
prophets
of
old
each
and
every
one
whenever
announcing
to
the
people
of
their
day
the
advent
of
the
coming
revelation
have
invariably
and
specifically
referred
to
that
sovereignty
with
which
the
promised
manifestation
must
needs
be
invested
this
is
attested
by
the
records
of
the
scriptures
of
the
past
this
sovereignty
hath
not
been
solely
and
exclusively
attributed
to
the
qá
im
nay
rather
the
attribute
of
sovereignty
and
all
other
names
and
attributes
of
god
have
been
and
will
ever
be
vouchsafed
unto
all
the
manifestations
of
god
before
and
after
him
inasmuch
as
these
manifestations
as
it
hath
already
been
explained
are
the
embodiments
of
the
attributes
of
god
the
invisible
and
the
revealers
of
the
divine
mysteries
furthermore
by
sovereignty
is
meant
the
power
which
is
inherently
exercised
by
the
qá
im
whether
or
not
he
appear
to
the
world
clothed
in
the
majesty
of
earthly
dominion
this
is
solely
dependent
upon
the
will
and
pleasure
of
the
qá
im
himself
you
will
readily
recognize
that
the
terms
sovereignty
wealth
life
death
judgment
and
resurrection
spoken
of
by
the
scriptures
of
old
are
not
what
this
generation
hath
conceived
and
vainly
imagined
nay
by
sovereignty
is
meant
that
sovereignty
which
in
every
dispensation
resideth
within
and
is
exercised
by
the
person
of
the
manifestation
the
of
truth
that
sovereignty
is
the
spiritual
ascendancy
which
he
exerciseth
to
the
fullest
degree
over
all
that
is
in
heaven
and
on
earth
and
which
in
due
time
revealeth
itself
to
the
world
in
direct
proportion
to
its
capacity
and
spiritual
receptiveness
even
as
the
sovereignty
of
muḥammad
the
messenger
of
god
is
today
apparent
and
manifest
amongst
the
people
you
are
well
aware
of
what
befell
his
faith
in
the
early
days
of
his
dispensation
what
woeful
sufferings
did
the
hand
of
the
infidel
and
erring
the
divines
of
that
age
and
their
associates
inflict
upon
that
spiritual
essence
that
most
pure
and
holy
being
how
abundant
the
thorns
and
briars
which
they
have
strewn
over
his
path
it
is
evident
that
wretched
generation
in
their
wicked
and
satanic
fancy
regarded
every
injury
to
that
immortal
being
as
a
means
to
the
attainment
of
an
abiding
felicity
inasmuch
as
the
recognized
divines
of
that
age
such
as
abdu
amír
the
hermit
ka
and
all
treated
him
as
an
impostor
and
pronounced
him
a
lunatic
and
a
calumniator
such
sore
accusations
they
brought
against
him
that
in
recounting
them
god
forbiddeth
the
ink
to
flow
our
pen
to
move
or
the
page
to
bear
them
these
malicious
imputations
provoked
the
people
to
arise
and
torment
him
and
how
fierce
that
torment
if
the
divines
of
the
age
be
its
chief
instigators
if
they
denounce
him
to
their
followers
cast
him
out
from
their
midst
and
declare
him
a
miscreant
hath
not
the
same
befallen
this
servant
and
been
witnessed
by
all
for
this
reason
did
muḥammad
cry
out
no
prophet
of
god
hath
suffered
such
harm
as
i
have
and
in
the
qur
án
are
recorded
all
the
calumnies
and
reproaches
uttered
against
him
as
well
as
all
the
afflictions
which
he
suffered
refer
ye
thereunto
that
haply
ye
may
be
informed
of
that
which
hath
befallen
his
revelation
so
grievous
was
his
plight
that
for
a
time
all
ceased
to
hold
intercourse
with
him
and
his
companions
whoever
associated
with
him
fell
a
victim
to
the
relentless
cruelty
of
his
enemies
we
shall
cite
in
this
connection
only
one
verse
of
that
book
shouldst
thou
observe
it
with
a
discerning
eye
thou
wilt
all
the
remaining
days
of
thy
life
lament
and
bewail
the
injury
of
muḥammad
that
wronged
and
oppressed
messenger
of
god
that
verse
was
revealed
at
a
time
when
muḥammad
languished
weary
and
sorrowful
beneath
the
weight
of
the
opposition
of
the
people
and
of
their
unceasing
torture
in
the
midst
of
his
agony
the
voice
of
gabriel
calling
from
the
sadratu
was
heard
saying
but
if
their
opposition
be
grievous
to
thou
canst
seek
out
an
opening
into
the
earth
or
a
ladder
into
the
implication
of
this
utterance
is
that
his
case
had
no
remedy
that
they
would
not
withhold
their
hands
from
him
unless
he
should
hide
himself
beneath
the
depths
of
the
earth
or
take
his
flight
unto
heaven
consider
how
great
is
the
change
today
behold
how
many
are
the
sovereigns
who
bow
the
knee
before
his
name
how
numerous
the
nations
and
kingdoms
who
have
sought
the
shelter
of
his
shadow
who
bear
allegiance
to
his
faith
and
pride
themselves
therein
from
the
there
ascendeth
today
the
words
of
praise
which
in
utter
lowliness
glorify
his
blessed
name
and
from
the
heights
of
minarets
there
resoundeth
the
call
that
summoneth
the
concourse
of
his
people
to
adore
him
even
those
kings
of
the
earth
who
have
refused
to
embrace
his
faith
and
to
put
off
the
garment
of
unbelief
none
the
less
confess
and
acknowledge
the
greatness
and
overpowering
majesty
of
that
of
loving
kindness
such
is
his
earthly
sovereignty
the
evidences
of
which
thou
dost
on
every
side
behold
this
sovereignty
must
needs
be
revealed
and
established
either
in
the
lifetime
of
every
manifestation
of
god
or
after
his
ascension
unto
his
true
habitation
in
the
realms
above
what
thou
dost
witness
today
is
but
a
confirmation
of
this
truth
that
spiritual
ascendency
however
which
is
primarily
intended
resideth
within
and
revolveth
around
them
from
eternity
even
unto
eternity
it
can
never
for
a
moment
be
divorced
from
them
its
dominion
hath
encompassed
all
that
is
in
heaven
and
on
earth
the
following
is
an
evidence
of
the
sovereignty
exercised
by
muḥammad
the
of
truth
hast
thou
not
heard
how
with
one
single
verse
he
hath
sundered
light
from
darkness
the
righteous
from
the
ungodly
and
the
believing
from
the
infidel
all
the
signs
and
allusions
concerning
the
day
of
judgment
which
thou
hast
heard
such
as
the
raising
of
the
dead
the
day
of
reckoning
the
last
judgment
and
others
have
been
made
manifest
through
the
revelation
of
that
verse
these
revealed
words
were
a
blessing
to
the
righteous
who
on
hearing
them
exclaimed
o
god
our
lord
we
have
heard
and
they
were
a
curse
to
the
people
of
iniquity
who
on
hearing
them
affirmed
we
have
heard
and
those
words
sharp
as
the
sword
of
god
have
separated
the
faithful
from
the
infidel
and
severed
father
from
son
thou
hast
surely
witnessed
how
they
that
have
confessed
their
faith
in
him
and
they
that
rejected
him
have
warred
against
each
other
and
sought
one
another
s
property
how
many
fathers
have
turned
away
from
their
sons
how
many
lovers
have
shunned
their
beloved
so
mercilessly
trenchant
was
this
wondrous
sword
of
god
that
it
cleft
asunder
every
relationship
on
the
other
hand
consider
the
welding
power
of
his
word
observe
how
those
in
whose
midst
the
satan
of
self
had
for
years
sown
the
seeds
of
malice
and
hate
became
so
fused
and
blended
through
their
allegiance
to
this
wondrous
and
transcendent
revelation
that
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
sprung
from
the
same
loins
such
is
the
binding
force
of
the
word
of
god
which
uniteth
the
hearts
of
them
that
have
renounced
all
else
but
him
who
have
believed
in
his
signs
and
quaffed
from
the
hand
of
glory
the
kawthar
of
god
s
holy
grace
furthermore
how
numerous
are
those
peoples
of
divers
beliefs
of
conflicting
creeds
and
opposing
temperaments
who
through
the
reviving
fragrance
of
the
divine
springtime
breathing
from
the
ridván
of
god
have
been
arrayed
with
the
new
robe
of
divine
unity
and
have
drunk
from
the
cup
of
his
singleness
this
is
the
significance
of
the
words
the
wolf
and
the
lamb
shall
feed
behold
the
ignorance
and
folly
of
those
who
like
the
nations
of
old
are
still
expecting
to
witness
the
time
when
these
beasts
will
feed
together
in
one
pasture
such
is
their
low
estate
methinks
never
have
their
lips
touched
the
cup
of
understanding
neither
have
their
feet
trodden
the
path
of
justice
besides
of
what
profit
would
it
be
to
the
world
were
such
a
thing
to
take
place
how
well
hath
he
spoken
concerning
them
hearts
have
they
with
which
they
understand
not
and
eyes
have
they
with
which
they
see
not
consider
how
with
this
one
verse
which
hath
descended
from
the
heaven
of
the
will
of
god
the
world
and
all
that
is
therein
have
been
brought
to
a
reckoning
with
him
whosoever
acknowledged
his
truth
and
turned
unto
him
his
good
works
outweighed
his
misdeeds
and
all
his
sins
were
remitted
and
forgiven
thereby
is
the
truth
of
these
words
concerning
him
made
manifest
swift
is
he
in
thus
god
turneth
iniquity
into
righteousness
were
ye
to
explore
the
realms
of
divine
knowledge
and
fathom
the
mysteries
of
his
wisdom
in
like
manner
whosoever
partook
of
the
cup
of
love
obtained
his
portion
of
the
ocean
of
eternal
grace
and
of
the
showers
of
everlasting
mercy
and
entered
into
the
life
of
heavenly
and
everlasting
life
but
he
that
turned
away
from
that
cup
was
condemned
to
eternal
death
by
the
terms
life
and
death
spoken
of
in
the
scriptures
is
intended
the
life
of
faith
and
the
death
of
unbelief
the
generality
of
the
people
owing
to
their
failure
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
these
words
rejected
and
despised
the
person
of
the
manifestation
deprived
themselves
of
the
light
of
his
divine
guidance
and
refused
to
follow
the
example
of
that
immortal
beauty
when
the
light
of
qur
ánic
revelation
was
kindled
within
the
chamber
of
muḥammad
s
holy
heart
he
passed
upon
the
people
the
verdict
of
the
last
day
the
verdict
of
resurrection
of
judgment
of
life
and
of
death
thereupon
the
standards
of
revolt
were
hoisted
and
the
doors
of
derision
opened
thus
hath
he
the
spirit
of
god
recorded
as
spoken
by
the
infidels
and
if
thou
shouldst
say
after
death
ye
shall
surely
be
raised
again
the
infidels
will
certainly
exclaim
this
is
nothing
but
manifest
again
he
speaketh
if
ever
thou
dost
marvel
marvellous
surely
is
their
saying
what
when
we
have
become
dust
shall
we
be
restored
in
a
new
creation
thus
in
another
passage
he
wrathfully
exclaimeth
are
we
wearied
out
with
the
first
creation
yet
are
they
in
doubt
with
regard
to
a
new
creation
as
the
commentators
of
the
qur
án
and
they
that
follow
the
letter
thereof
misapprehended
the
inner
meaning
of
the
words
of
god
and
failed
to
grasp
their
essential
purpose
they
sought
to
demonstrate
that
according
to
the
rules
of
grammar
whenever
the
term
idhá
meaning
if
or
when
precedeth
the
past
tense
it
invariably
hath
reference
to
the
future
later
they
were
sore
perplexed
in
attempting
to
explain
those
verses
of
the
book
wherein
that
term
did
not
actually
occur
even
as
he
hath
revealed
and
there
was
a
blast
on
the
trumpet
it
is
the
threatened
day
and
every
soul
is
summoned
to
a
reckoning
him
an
impeller
and
a
in
explaining
this
and
similar
verses
they
have
in
some
cases
argued
that
the
term
idhá
is
implied
in
other
instances
they
have
idly
contended
that
whereas
the
day
of
judgment
is
inevitable
it
hath
therefore
been
referred
to
as
an
event
not
of
the
future
but
of
the
past
how
vain
their
sophistry
how
grievous
their
blindness
they
refuse
to
recognize
the
which
so
explicitly
in
this
text
was
sounded
through
the
revelation
of
muḥammad
they
deprive
themselves
of
the
regenerating
spirit
of
god
that
breathed
into
it
and
foolishly
expect
to
hear
the
of
the
seraph
of
god
who
is
but
one
of
his
servants
hath
not
the
seraph
himself
the
angel
of
the
judgment
day
and
his
like
been
ordained
by
muḥammad
s
own
utterance
say
what
will
ye
give
that
which
is
for
your
good
in
exchange
for
that
which
is
evil
wretched
is
that
which
ye
have
falsely
exchanged
surely
ye
are
a
people
evil
in
grievous
loss
nay
by
trumpet
is
meant
the
of
muḥammad
s
revelation
which
was
sounded
in
the
heart
of
the
universe
and
by
resurrection
is
meant
his
own
rise
to
proclaim
the
cause
of
god
he
bade
the
erring
and
wayward
arise
and
speed
out
of
the
sepulchres
of
their
bodies
arrayed
them
with
the
beauteous
robe
of
faith
and
quickened
them
with
the
breath
of
a
new
and
wondrous
life
thus
at
the
hour
when
muḥammad
that
divine
beauty
purposed
to
unveil
one
of
the
mysteries
hidden
in
the
symbolic
terms
resurrection
judgment
paradise
and
hell
gabriel
the
voice
of
inspiration
was
heard
saying
erelong
will
they
wag
their
heads
at
thee
and
say
when
shall
this
be
say
perchance
it
is
the
implications
of
this
verse
alone
suffice
the
peoples
of
the
world
were
they
to
ponder
it
in
their
hearts
gracious
god
how
far
have
that
people
strayed
from
the
way
of
god
although
the
day
of
resurrection
was
ushered
in
through
the
revelation
of
muḥammad
although
his
light
and
tokens
had
encompassed
the
earth
and
all
that
is
therein
yet
that
people
derided
him
gave
themselves
up
to
those
idols
which
the
divines
of
that
age
in
their
vain
and
idle
fancy
had
conceived
and
deprived
themselves
of
the
light
of
heavenly
grace
and
of
the
showers
of
divine
mercy
yea
the
abject
beetle
can
never
scent
the
fragrance
of
holiness
and
the
bat
of
darkness
can
never
face
the
splendour
of
the
sun
such
things
have
come
to
pass
in
the
days
of
every
manifestation
of
god
even
as
jesus
said
ye
must
be
born
again
he
saith
except
a
man
be
born
of
water
and
of
the
spirit
he
can
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
the
purport
of
these
words
is
that
whosoever
in
every
dispensation
is
born
of
the
spirit
and
is
quickened
by
the
breath
of
the
manifestation
of
holiness
he
verily
is
of
those
that
have
attained
unto
life
and
resurrection
and
have
entered
into
the
paradise
of
the
love
of
god
and
whosoever
is
not
of
them
is
condemned
to
death
and
deprivation
to
the
fire
of
unbelief
and
to
the
wrath
of
god
in
all
the
scriptures
the
books
and
chronicles
the
sentence
of
death
of
fire
of
blindness
of
want
of
understanding
and
hearing
hath
been
pronounced
against
those
whose
lips
have
tasted
not
the
ethereal
cup
of
true
knowledge
and
whose
hearts
have
been
deprived
of
the
grace
of
the
holy
spirit
in
their
day
even
as
it
hath
been
previously
recorded
hearts
have
they
with
which
they
understand
in
another
passage
of
the
gospel
it
is
written
and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
a
certain
day
the
father
of
one
of
the
disciples
of
jesus
had
that
disciple
reporting
the
death
of
his
father
unto
jesus
asked
for
leave
to
go
and
bury
him
whereupon
jesus
that
essence
of
detachment
answered
and
said
let
the
dead
bury
their
in
like
manner
two
of
the
people
of
kúfih
went
to
alí
the
commander
of
the
faithful
one
owned
a
house
and
wished
to
sell
it
the
other
was
to
be
the
purchaser
they
had
agreed
that
this
transaction
should
be
effected
and
the
contract
be
written
with
the
knowledge
of
alí
he
the
exponent
of
the
law
of
god
addressing
the
scribe
said
write
thou
a
dead
man
hath
bought
from
another
dead
man
a
house
that
house
is
bounded
by
four
limits
one
extendeth
toward
the
tomb
the
other
to
the
vault
of
the
grave
the
third
to
the
ṣiraṭ
the
fourth
to
either
paradise
or
reflect
had
these
two
souls
been
quickened
by
the
of
alí
had
they
risen
from
the
grave
of
error
by
the
power
of
his
love
the
judgment
of
death
would
certainly
not
have
been
pronounced
against
them
in
every
age
and
century
the
purpose
of
the
prophets
of
god
and
their
chosen
ones
hath
been
no
other
but
to
affirm
the
spiritual
significance
of
the
terms
life
resurrection
and
if
one
will
ponder
but
for
a
while
this
utterance
of
alí
in
his
heart
one
will
surely
discover
all
mysteries
hidden
in
the
terms
grave
tomb
ṣiraṭ
paradise
and
but
oh
how
strange
and
pitiful
behold
all
the
people
are
imprisoned
within
the
tomb
of
self
and
lie
buried
beneath
the
nethermost
depths
of
worldly
desire
wert
thou
to
attain
to
but
a
dewdrop
of
the
crystal
waters
of
divine
knowledge
thou
wouldst
readily
realize
that
true
life
is
not
the
life
of
the
flesh
but
the
life
of
the
spirit
for
the
life
of
the
flesh
is
common
to
both
men
and
animals
whereas
the
life
of
the
spirit
is
possessed
only
by
the
pure
in
heart
who
have
quaffed
from
the
ocean
of
faith
and
partaken
of
the
fruit
of
certitude
this
life
knoweth
no
death
and
this
existence
is
crowned
by
immortality
even
as
it
hath
been
said
he
who
is
a
true
believer
liveth
both
in
this
world
and
in
the
world
to
if
by
life
be
meant
this
earthly
life
it
is
evident
that
death
must
needs
overtake
it
similarly
the
records
of
all
the
scriptures
bear
witness
to
this
lofty
truth
and
this
most
exalted
word
moreover
this
verse
of
the
qur
án
revealed
concerning
ḥamzih
the
prince
of
martyrs
and
is
a
luminous
evidence
and
sure
testimony
of
the
truth
of
our
saying
shall
the
dead
whom
we
have
quickened
and
for
whom
we
have
ordained
a
light
whereby
he
may
walk
among
men
be
like
him
whose
likeness
is
in
the
darkness
whence
he
will
not
come
forth
this
verse
descended
from
the
heaven
of
the
primal
will
at
a
time
when
ḥamzih
had
already
been
invested
with
the
sacred
mantle
of
faith
and
had
waxed
relentless
in
his
opposition
and
unbelief
from
the
wellspring
of
omnipotence
and
the
source
of
eternal
holiness
there
came
the
judgment
that
conferred
everlasting
life
upon
ḥamzih
and
condemned
to
eternal
damnation
this
was
the
signal
that
caused
the
fires
of
unbelief
to
glow
with
the
hottest
flame
in
the
heart
of
the
infidels
and
provoked
them
openly
to
repudiate
his
truth
they
loudly
clamoured
when
did
ḥamzih
die
when
was
he
risen
at
what
hour
was
such
a
life
conferred
upon
him
as
they
understood
not
the
significance
of
these
noble
sayings
nor
sought
enlightenment
from
the
recognized
expounders
of
the
faith
that
these
might
confer
a
sprinkling
of
the
kawthar
of
divine
knowledge
upon
them
therefore
such
fires
of
mischief
were
kindled
amongst
men
thou
dost
witness
today
how
notwithstanding
the
radiant
splendour
of
the
sun
of
divine
knowledge
all
the
people
whether
high
or
low
have
clung
to
the
ways
of
those
abject
manifestations
of
the
prince
of
darkness
they
continually
appeal
to
them
for
aid
in
unraveling
the
intricacies
of
their
faith
and
owing
to
lack
of
knowledge
they
make
such
replies
as
can
in
no
wise
damage
their
fame
and
fortune
it
is
evident
that
these
souls
vile
and
miserable
as
the
beetle
itself
have
had
no
portion
of
the
breeze
of
eternity
and
have
never
entered
the
ridván
of
heavenly
delight
how
therefore
can
they
impart
unto
others
the
imperishable
fragrance
of
holiness
such
is
their
way
and
such
will
it
remain
for
ever
only
those
will
attain
to
the
knowledge
of
the
word
of
god
that
have
turned
unto
him
and
repudiated
the
manifestations
of
satan
thus
god
hath
reaffirmed
the
law
of
the
day
of
his
revelation
and
inscribed
it
with
the
pen
of
power
upon
the
mystic
tablet
hidden
beneath
the
veil
of
celestial
glory
wert
thou
to
heed
these
words
wert
thou
to
ponder
their
outward
and
inner
meaning
in
thy
heart
thou
wouldst
seize
the
significance
of
all
the
abstruse
problems
which
in
this
day
have
become
insuperable
barriers
between
men
and
the
knowledge
of
the
day
of
judgment
then
wilt
thou
have
no
more
questions
to
perplex
thee
we
fain
would
hope
that
god
willing
thou
wilt
not
return
deprived
and
still
athirst
from
the
shores
of
the
ocean
of
divine
mercy
nor
come
back
destitute
from
the
imperishable
sanctuary
of
thy
heart
s
desire
let
it
now
be
seen
what
thy
search
and
endeavours
will
achieve
to
resume
our
purpose
in
setting
forth
these
truths
hath
been
to
demonstrate
the
sovereignty
of
him
who
is
the
king
of
kings
be
fair
is
this
sovereignty
which
through
the
utterance
of
one
word
hath
manifested
such
pervading
influence
ascendancy
and
awful
majesty
is
this
sovereignty
superior
or
is
the
worldly
dominion
of
these
kings
of
the
earth
who
despite
their
solicitude
for
their
subjects
and
their
help
of
the
poor
are
assured
only
of
an
outward
and
fleeting
allegiance
while
in
the
hearts
of
men
they
inspire
neither
affection
nor
respect
hath
not
that
sovereignty
through
the
potency
of
one
word
subdued
quickened
and
revitalized
the
whole
world
what
can
the
lowly
dust
compare
with
him
who
is
the
lord
of
lords
what
tongue
dare
utter
the
immensity
of
difference
that
lieth
between
them
nay
all
comparison
falleth
short
in
attaining
the
hallowed
sanctuary
of
his
sovereignty
were
man
to
reflect
he
would
surely
perceive
that
even
the
servant
of
his
threshold
ruleth
over
all
created
things
this
hath
already
been
witnessed
and
will
in
future
be
made
manifest
this
is
but
one
of
the
meanings
of
the
spiritual
sovereignty
which
we
have
set
forth
in
accordance
with
the
capacity
and
receptiveness
of
the
people
for
he
the
mover
of
all
beings
that
glorified
countenance
is
the
source
of
such
potencies
as
neither
this
wronged
one
can
reveal
nor
this
unworthy
people
comprehend
immensely
exalted
is
he
above
men
s
praise
of
his
sovereignty
glorified
is
he
beyond
that
which
they
attribute
unto
him
and
now
ponder
this
in
thine
heart
were
sovereignty
to
mean
earthly
sovereignty
and
worldly
dominion
were
it
to
imply
the
subjection
and
external
allegiance
of
all
the
peoples
and
kindreds
of
the
his
loved
ones
should
be
exalted
and
be
made
to
live
in
peace
and
his
enemies
be
abased
and
form
of
sovereignty
would
not
be
true
of
god
himself
the
source
of
all
dominion
whose
majesty
and
power
all
things
testify
for
dost
thou
not
witness
how
the
generality
of
mankind
is
under
the
sway
of
his
enemies
have
they
not
all
turned
away
from
the
path
of
his
have
they
not
done
that
which
he
hath
forbidden
and
left
undone
nay
repudiated
and
opposed
those
things
which
he
hath
commanded
have
not
his
friends
ever
been
the
victims
of
the
tyranny
of
his
foes
all
these
things
are
more
obvious
than
even
the
splendour
of
the
sun
know
therefore
o
questioning
seeker
that
earthly
sovereignty
is
of
no
worth
nor
will
it
ever
be
in
the
eyes
of
god
and
his
chosen
ones
moreover
if
ascendency
and
dominion
be
interpreted
to
mean
earthly
supremacy
and
temporal
power
how
impossible
will
it
be
for
thee
to
explain
these
verses
and
verily
our
host
shall
fain
would
they
put
out
god
s
light
with
their
mouths
but
god
hath
willed
to
perfect
his
light
albeit
the
infidels
abhor
he
is
the
dominant
above
all
similarly
most
of
the
qur
án
testifieth
to
this
truth
were
the
idle
contention
of
these
foolish
and
despicable
souls
to
be
true
they
would
have
none
other
alternative
than
to
reject
all
these
holy
utterances
and
heavenly
allusions
for
no
warrior
could
be
found
on
earth
more
excellent
and
nearer
to
god
than
ḥusayn
son
of
alí
so
peerless
and
incomparable
was
he
there
was
none
to
equal
or
to
match
him
in
the
yet
thou
must
have
heard
what
befell
him
god
s
malison
on
the
head
of
the
people
of
tyranny
were
the
verse
and
verily
our
host
shall
conquer
to
be
literally
interpreted
it
is
evident
that
it
would
in
no
wise
be
applicable
to
the
chosen
ones
of
god
and
his
hosts
inasmuch
as
ḥusayn
whose
heroism
was
manifest
as
the
sun
crushed
and
subjugated
quaffed
at
last
the
cup
of
martyrdom
in
karbilá
the
land
of
táff
similarly
the
sacred
verse
fain
would
they
put
out
god
s
light
with
their
mouths
but
god
hath
willed
to
perfect
his
light
albeit
the
infidels
abhor
were
it
to
be
literally
interpreted
it
would
never
correspond
with
the
truth
for
in
every
age
the
light
of
god
hath
to
outward
seeming
been
quenched
by
the
peoples
of
the
earth
and
the
lamps
of
god
extinguished
by
them
how
then
could
the
ascendancy
of
the
sovereignty
of
these
lamps
be
explained
what
could
the
potency
of
god
s
will
to
perfect
his
light
signify
as
hath
already
been
witnessed
so
great
was
the
enmity
of
the
infidels
that
none
of
these
divine
luminaries
ever
found
a
place
for
shelter
or
tasted
of
the
cup
of
tranquillity
so
heavily
were
they
oppressed
that
the
least
of
men
inflicted
upon
these
essences
of
being
whatsoever
he
listed
these
sufferings
have
been
observed
and
measured
by
the
people
how
therefore
can
such
people
be
capable
of
understanding
and
expounding
these
words
of
god
these
verses
of
everlasting
glory
but
the
purpose
of
these
verses
is
not
what
they
have
imagined
nay
the
terms
ascendancy
power
and
authority
imply
a
totally
different
station
and
meaning
for
instance
consider
the
pervading
power
of
those
drops
of
the
blood
of
ḥusayn
which
besprinkled
the
earth
what
ascendancy
and
influence
hath
the
dust
itself
through
the
sacredness
and
potency
of
that
blood
exercised
over
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
so
much
so
that
he
who
sought
deliverance
from
his
ills
was
healed
by
touching
the
dust
of
that
holy
ground
and
whosoever
wishing
to
protect
his
property
treasured
with
absolute
faith
and
understanding
a
little
of
that
holy
earth
within
his
house
safeguarded
all
his
possessions
these
are
the
outward
manifestations
of
its
potency
and
were
we
to
recount
its
hidden
virtues
they
would
assuredly
say
he
verily
hath
considered
the
dust
to
be
the
lord
of
lords
and
hath
utterly
forsaken
the
faith
of
furthermore
call
to
mind
the
shameful
circumstances
that
have
attended
the
martyrdom
of
ḥusayn
reflect
upon
his
loneliness
how
to
outer
seeming
none
could
be
found
to
aid
him
none
to
take
up
his
body
and
bury
it
and
yet
behold
how
numerous
in
this
day
are
those
who
from
the
uttermost
corners
of
the
earth
don
the
garb
of
pilgrimage
seeking
the
site
of
his
martyrdom
that
there
they
may
lay
their
heads
upon
the
threshold
of
his
shrine
such
is
the
ascendancy
and
power
of
god
such
is
the
glory
of
his
dominion
and
majesty
think
not
that
because
these
things
have
come
to
pass
after
ḥusayn
s
martyrdom
therefore
all
this
glory
hath
been
of
no
profit
unto
him
for
that
holy
soul
is
immortal
liveth
the
life
of
god
and
abideth
within
the
retreats
of
celestial
glory
upon
the
sadrih
of
heavenly
reunion
these
essences
of
being
are
the
shining
exemplars
of
sacrifice
they
have
offered
and
will
continue
to
offer
up
their
lives
their
substance
their
souls
their
spirit
their
all
in
the
path
of
the
by
them
no
station
however
exalted
could
be
more
dearly
cherished
for
lovers
have
no
desire
but
the
of
their
beloved
and
have
no
aim
except
reunion
with
him
should
we
wish
to
impart
unto
thee
a
glimmer
of
the
mysteries
of
ḥusayn
s
martyrdom
and
reveal
unto
thee
the
fruits
thereof
these
pages
could
never
suffice
nor
exhaust
their
meaning
our
hope
is
that
god
willing
the
breeze
of
mercy
may
blow
and
the
divine
springtime
clothe
the
tree
of
being
with
the
robe
of
a
new
life
so
that
we
may
discover
the
mysteries
of
divine
wisdom
and
through
his
providence
be
made
independent
of
the
knowledge
of
all
things
we
have
as
yet
descried
none
but
a
handful
of
souls
destitute
of
all
renown
who
have
attained
unto
this
station
let
the
future
disclose
what
the
judgment
of
god
will
ordain
and
the
tabernacle
of
his
decree
reveal
in
such
wise
we
recount
unto
thee
the
wonders
of
the
cause
of
god
and
pour
out
into
thine
ears
the
strains
of
heavenly
melody
that
haply
thou
mayest
attain
unto
the
station
of
true
knowledge
and
partake
of
the
fruit
thereof
therefore
know
thou
of
a
certainty
that
these
luminaries
of
heavenly
majesty
though
their
dwelling
be
in
the
dust
yet
their
true
habitation
is
the
seat
of
glory
in
the
realms
above
though
bereft
of
all
earthly
possessions
yet
they
soar
in
the
realms
of
immeasurable
riches
and
whilst
sore
tried
in
the
grip
of
the
enemy
they
are
seated
on
the
right
hand
of
power
and
celestial
dominion
amidst
the
darkness
of
their
abasement
there
shineth
upon
them
the
light
of
unfading
glory
and
upon
their
helplessness
are
showered
the
tokens
of
an
invincible
sovereignty
thus
jesus
son
of
mary
whilst
seated
one
day
and
speaking
in
the
strain
of
the
holy
spirit
uttered
words
such
as
these
o
people
my
food
is
the
grass
of
the
field
wherewith
i
satisfy
my
hunger
my
bed
is
the
dust
my
lamp
in
the
night
the
light
of
the
moon
and
my
steed
my
own
feet
behold
who
on
earth
is
richer
than
i
by
the
righteousness
of
god
thousands
of
treasures
circle
round
this
poverty
and
a
myriad
kingdoms
of
glory
yearn
for
such
abasement
shouldst
thou
attain
to
a
drop
of
the
ocean
of
the
inner
meaning
of
these
words
thou
wouldst
surely
forsake
the
world
and
all
that
is
therein
and
as
the
phoenix
wouldst
consume
thyself
in
the
flames
of
the
undying
fire
in
like
manner
it
is
related
that
on
a
certain
day
one
of
the
companions
of
ṣádiq
complained
of
his
poverty
before
him
whereupon
ṣádiq
that
immortal
beauty
made
reply
verily
thou
art
rich
and
hast
drunk
the
draught
of
that
soul
was
perplexed
at
the
words
uttered
by
that
luminous
countenance
and
said
where
are
my
riches
i
who
stand
in
need
of
a
single
coin
ṣádiq
thereupon
observed
dost
thou
not
possess
our
love
he
replied
yea
i
possess
it
o
thou
scion
of
the
prophet
of
god
and
ṣádiq
asked
him
saying
exchangest
thou
this
love
for
one
thousand
dinars
he
answered
nay
never
will
i
exchange
it
though
the
world
and
all
that
is
therein
be
given
me
then
ṣádiq
remarked
how
can
he
who
possesses
such
a
treasure
be
called
poor
this
poverty
and
these
riches
this
abasement
and
glory
this
dominion
power
and
the
like
upon
which
the
eyes
and
hearts
of
these
vain
and
foolish
souls
are
set
these
things
fade
into
utter
nothingness
in
that
court
even
as
he
hath
said
o
men
ye
are
but
paupers
in
need
of
god
but
god
is
the
rich
the
by
riches
therefore
is
meant
independence
of
all
else
but
god
and
by
poverty
the
lack
of
things
that
are
of
god
similarly
call
thou
to
mind
the
day
when
the
jews
who
had
surrounded
jesus
son
of
mary
were
pressing
him
to
confess
his
claim
of
being
the
messiah
and
prophet
of
god
so
that
they
might
declare
him
an
infidel
and
sentence
him
to
death
then
they
led
him
away
he
who
was
the
of
the
heaven
of
divine
revelation
unto
pilate
and
caiaphas
who
was
the
leading
divine
of
that
age
the
chief
priests
were
all
assembled
in
the
palace
also
a
multitude
of
people
who
had
gathered
to
witness
his
sufferings
to
deride
and
injure
him
though
they
repeatedly
questioned
him
hoping
that
he
would
confess
his
claim
yet
jesus
held
his
peace
and
spake
not
finally
an
accursed
of
god
arose
and
approaching
jesus
adjured
him
saying
didst
thou
not
claim
to
be
the
divine
messiah
didst
thou
not
say
i
am
the
king
of
kings
my
word
is
the
word
of
god
and
i
am
the
breaker
of
the
sabbath
day
thereupon
jesus
lifted
up
his
head
and
said
beholdest
thou
not
the
son
of
man
sitting
on
the
right
hand
of
power
and
might
these
were
his
words
and
yet
consider
how
to
outward
seeming
he
was
devoid
of
all
power
except
that
inner
power
which
was
of
god
and
which
had
encompassed
all
that
is
in
heaven
and
on
earth
how
can
i
relate
all
that
befell
him
after
he
spoke
these
words
how
shall
i
describe
their
heinous
behaviour
towards
him
they
at
last
heaped
on
his
blessed
person
such
woes
that
he
took
his
flight
unto
the
fourth
heaven
it
is
also
recorded
in
the
gospel
according
to
luke
that
on
a
certain
day
jesus
passed
by
a
jew
who
was
sick
of
the
palsy
and
lay
upon
a
couch
when
the
jew
saw
him
he
recognized
him
and
cried
out
for
his
help
jesus
said
unto
him
arise
from
thy
bed
thy
sins
are
forgiven
certain
of
the
jews
standing
by
protested
saying
who
can
forgive
sins
but
god
alone
and
immediately
he
perceived
their
thoughts
jesus
answering
said
unto
them
whether
is
it
easier
to
say
to
the
sick
of
the
palsy
arise
and
take
up
thy
bed
and
walk
or
to
say
thy
sins
are
forgiven
thee
that
ye
may
know
that
the
son
of
man
hath
power
on
earth
to
forgive
this
is
the
real
sovereignty
and
such
is
the
power
of
god
s
chosen
ones
all
these
things
which
we
have
repeatedly
mentioned
and
the
details
which
we
have
cited
from
divers
sources
have
no
other
purpose
but
to
enable
thee
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
allusions
in
the
utterances
of
the
chosen
ones
of
god
lest
certain
of
these
utterances
cause
thy
feet
to
falter
and
thy
heart
to
be
dismayed
thus
with
steadfast
steps
we
may
tread
the
path
of
certitude
that
perchance
the
breeze
that
bloweth
from
the
meads
of
the
of
god
may
waft
upon
us
the
sweet
savours
of
divine
acceptance
and
cause
us
vanishing
mortals
that
we
are
to
attain
unto
the
kingdom
of
everlasting
glory
then
wilt
thou
comprehend
the
inner
meaning
of
sovereignty
and
the
like
spoken
of
in
the
traditions
and
scriptures
furthermore
it
is
already
evident
and
known
unto
thee
that
those
things
to
which
the
jews
and
the
christians
have
clung
and
the
cavilings
which
they
heaped
upon
the
beauty
of
muḥammad
the
same
have
in
this
day
been
upheld
by
the
people
of
the
qur
án
and
been
witnessed
in
their
denunciations
of
the
point
of
the
bayán
the
souls
of
all
that
dwell
within
the
kingdom
of
divine
revelations
be
a
sacrifice
unto
him
behold
their
folly
they
utter
the
words
uttered
by
the
jews
of
old
and
know
it
not
how
well
and
true
are
his
words
concerning
them
leave
them
to
entertain
themselves
with
their
cavilings
as
thou
livest
o
muḥammad
they
are
seized
by
the
frenzy
of
their
vain
when
the
unseen
the
eternal
the
divine
essence
caused
the
of
muḥammad
to
rise
above
the
horizon
of
knowledge
among
the
cavils
which
the
jewish
divines
raised
against
him
was
that
after
moses
no
prophet
should
be
sent
of
god
yea
mention
hath
been
made
in
the
scriptures
of
a
soul
who
must
needs
be
made
manifest
and
who
will
advance
the
faith
and
promote
the
interests
of
the
people
of
moses
so
that
the
law
of
the
mosaic
dispensation
may
encompass
the
whole
earth
thus
hath
the
king
of
eternal
glory
referred
in
his
book
to
the
words
uttered
by
those
wanderers
in
the
vale
of
remoteness
and
error
the
hand
of
god
say
the
jews
is
chained
chained
up
be
their
own
hands
and
for
that
which
they
have
said
they
were
accursed
nay
outstretched
are
both
his
hands
the
hand
of
god
is
above
their
although
the
commentators
of
the
qur
án
have
related
in
divers
manners
the
circumstances
attending
the
revelation
of
this
verse
yet
thou
shouldst
endeavour
to
apprehend
the
purpose
thereof
he
saith
how
false
is
that
which
the
jews
have
imagined
how
can
the
hand
of
him
who
is
the
king
in
truth
who
caused
the
countenance
of
moses
to
be
made
manifest
and
conferred
upon
him
the
robe
of
can
the
hand
of
such
a
one
be
chained
and
fettered
how
can
he
be
conceived
as
powerless
to
raise
up
yet
another
messenger
after
moses
behold
the
absurdity
of
their
saying
how
far
it
hath
strayed
from
the
path
of
knowledge
and
understanding
observe
how
in
this
day
also
all
these
people
have
occupied
themselves
with
such
foolish
absurdities
for
over
a
thousand
years
they
have
been
reciting
this
verse
and
unwittingly
pronouncing
their
censure
against
the
jews
utterly
unaware
that
they
themselves
openly
and
privily
are
voicing
the
sentiments
and
belief
of
the
jewish
people
thou
art
surely
aware
of
their
idle
contention
that
all
revelation
is
ended
that
the
portals
of
divine
mercy
are
closed
that
from
the
of
eternal
holiness
no
sun
shall
rise
again
that
the
ocean
of
everlasting
bounty
is
forever
stilled
and
that
out
of
the
tabernacle
of
ancient
glory
the
messengers
of
god
have
ceased
to
be
made
manifest
such
is
the
measure
of
the
understanding
of
these
contemptible
people
these
people
have
imagined
that
the
flow
of
god
s
grace
and
plenteous
mercies
the
cessation
of
which
no
mind
can
contemplate
has
been
halted
from
every
side
they
have
risen
and
girded
up
the
loins
of
tyranny
and
exerted
the
utmost
endeavour
to
quench
with
the
bitter
waters
of
their
vain
fancy
the
flame
of
god
s
burning
bush
oblivious
that
the
globe
of
power
shall
within
its
own
mighty
stronghold
protect
the
lamp
of
god
the
utter
destitution
into
which
this
people
have
fallen
doth
surely
suffice
them
inasmuch
as
they
have
been
deprived
of
the
recognition
of
the
essential
purpose
and
the
knowledge
of
the
mystery
and
substance
of
the
cause
of
god
for
the
highest
and
most
excelling
grace
bestowed
upon
men
is
the
grace
of
attaining
unto
the
presence
of
god
and
of
his
recognition
which
has
been
promised
unto
all
people
this
is
the
utmost
degree
of
grace
vouchsafed
unto
man
by
the
the
ancient
of
days
and
the
fulness
of
his
absolute
bounty
upon
his
creatures
of
this
grace
and
bounty
none
of
this
people
hath
partaken
neither
have
they
been
honoured
with
this
most
exalted
distinction
how
numerous
are
those
revealed
verses
which
explicitly
bear
witness
unto
this
most
weighty
truth
and
exalted
theme
and
yet
they
have
rejected
it
and
after
their
own
desire
misconstrued
its
meaning
even
as
he
hath
revealed
as
for
those
who
believe
not
in
the
signs
of
god
or
that
they
shall
ever
meet
him
these
of
my
mercy
shall
despair
and
for
them
doth
a
grievous
chastisement
also
he
saith
they
who
bear
in
mind
that
they
shall
attain
unto
the
presence
of
their
lord
and
that
unto
him
shall
they
also
in
another
instance
he
saith
they
who
held
it
as
certain
that
they
must
meet
god
said
how
oft
by
god
s
will
hath
a
small
host
vanquished
a
numerous
host
in
yet
another
instance
he
revealeth
let
him
then
who
hopeth
to
attain
the
presence
of
his
lord
work
a
righteous
and
also
he
saith
he
ordereth
all
things
he
maketh
his
signs
clear
that
ye
may
have
firm
faith
in
attaining
the
presence
of
your
this
people
have
repudiated
all
these
verses
that
unmistakably
testify
to
the
reality
of
attainment
unto
the
divine
no
theme
hath
been
more
emphatically
asserted
in
the
holy
scriptures
notwithstanding
they
have
deprived
themselves
of
this
lofty
and
most
exalted
rank
this
supreme
and
glorious
station
some
have
contended
that
by
attainment
unto
the
divine
presence
is
meant
the
revelation
of
god
in
the
day
of
resurrection
should
they
assert
that
the
revelation
of
god
signifieth
a
universal
revelation
it
is
clear
and
evident
that
such
revelation
already
existeth
in
all
things
the
truth
of
this
we
have
already
established
inasmuch
as
we
have
demonstrated
that
all
things
are
the
recipients
and
revealers
of
the
splendours
of
that
ideal
king
and
that
the
signs
of
the
revelation
of
that
sun
the
source
of
all
splendour
exist
and
are
manifest
in
the
mirrors
of
beings
nay
were
man
to
gaze
with
the
eye
of
divine
and
spiritual
discernment
he
will
readily
recognize
that
nothing
whatsoever
can
exist
without
the
revelation
of
the
splendour
of
god
the
ideal
king
consider
how
all
created
things
eloquently
testify
to
the
revelation
of
that
inner
light
within
them
behold
how
within
all
things
the
portals
of
the
ridván
of
god
are
opened
that
seekers
may
attain
the
cities
of
understanding
and
wisdom
and
enter
the
gardens
of
knowledge
and
power
within
every
garden
they
will
behold
the
mystic
bride
of
inner
meaning
enshrined
within
the
chambers
of
utterance
in
the
utmost
grace
and
fullest
adornment
most
of
the
verses
of
the
qur
án
indicate
and
bear
witness
to
this
spiritual
theme
the
verse
neither
is
there
aught
which
doth
not
celebrate
his
praise
is
eloquent
testimony
thereto
and
we
noted
all
things
and
wrote
them
down
a
faithful
witness
thereof
now
if
by
attainment
unto
the
presence
of
god
is
meant
attainment
unto
the
knowledge
of
such
revelation
it
is
evident
that
all
men
have
already
attained
unto
the
presence
of
the
unchangeable
countenance
of
that
peerless
king
why
then
restrict
such
revelation
to
the
day
of
resurrection
and
were
they
to
maintain
that
by
divine
presence
is
meant
the
specific
revelation
of
god
expressed
by
certain
súfís
as
the
most
holy
outpouring
if
this
be
in
the
essence
itself
it
is
evident
that
it
hath
been
eternally
in
the
divine
knowledge
assuming
the
truth
of
this
hypothesis
attainment
unto
the
divine
presence
is
in
this
sense
obviously
possible
to
no
one
inasmuch
as
this
revelation
is
confined
to
the
innermost
essence
unto
which
no
man
can
attain
the
way
is
barred
and
all
seeking
the
minds
of
the
favourites
of
heaven
however
high
they
soar
can
never
attain
this
station
how
much
less
the
understanding
of
obscured
and
limited
minds
and
were
they
to
say
that
by
divine
presence
is
meant
the
secondary
revelation
of
god
interpreted
as
the
holy
outpouring
this
is
admittedly
applicable
to
the
world
of
creation
that
is
in
the
realm
of
the
primal
and
original
manifestation
of
god
such
revelation
is
confined
to
his
prophets
and
chosen
ones
inasmuch
as
none
mightier
than
they
hath
come
to
exist
in
the
world
of
being
this
truth
all
recognize
and
bear
witness
thereto
these
prophets
and
chosen
ones
of
god
are
the
recipients
and
revealers
of
all
the
unchangeable
attributes
and
names
of
god
they
are
the
mirrors
that
truly
and
faithfully
reflect
the
light
of
god
whatsoever
is
applicable
to
them
is
in
reality
applicable
to
god
himself
who
is
both
the
visible
and
the
invisible
the
knowledge
of
him
who
is
the
origin
of
all
things
and
attainment
unto
him
are
impossible
save
through
knowledge
of
and
attainment
unto
these
luminous
beings
who
proceed
from
the
sun
of
truth
by
attaining
therefore
to
the
presence
of
these
holy
luminaries
the
presence
of
god
himself
is
attained
from
their
knowledge
the
knowledge
of
god
is
revealed
and
from
the
light
of
their
countenance
the
splendour
of
the
face
of
god
is
made
manifest
through
the
manifold
attributes
of
these
essences
of
detachment
who
are
both
the
first
and
the
last
the
seen
and
the
hidden
it
is
made
evident
that
he
who
is
the
sun
of
truth
is
the
first
and
the
last
the
seen
and
the
likewise
the
other
lofty
names
and
exalted
attributes
of
god
therefore
whosoever
and
in
whatever
dispensation
hath
recognized
and
attained
unto
the
presence
of
these
glorious
these
resplendent
and
most
excellent
luminaries
hath
verily
attained
unto
the
presence
of
god
himself
and
entered
the
city
of
eternal
and
immortal
life
attainment
unto
such
presence
is
possible
only
in
the
day
of
resurrection
which
is
the
day
of
the
rise
of
god
himself
through
his
revelation
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
day
of
resurrection
spoken
of
in
all
the
scriptures
and
announced
unto
all
people
reflect
can
a
more
precious
a
mightier
and
more
glorious
day
than
this
be
conceived
so
that
man
should
willingly
forego
its
grace
and
deprive
himself
of
its
bounties
which
like
unto
vernal
showers
are
raining
from
the
heaven
of
mercy
upon
all
mankind
having
thus
conclusively
demonstrated
that
no
day
is
greater
than
this
day
and
no
revelation
more
glorious
than
this
revelation
and
having
set
forth
all
these
weighty
and
infallible
proofs
which
no
understanding
mind
can
question
and
no
man
of
learning
overlook
how
can
man
possibly
through
the
idle
contention
of
the
people
of
doubt
and
fancy
deprive
himself
of
such
a
bountiful
grace
have
they
not
heard
the
tradition
when
the
qá
im
riseth
that
day
is
the
day
of
resurrection
in
like
manner
the
imáms
those
unquenchable
lights
of
divine
guidance
have
interpreted
the
verse
what
can
such
expect
but
that
god
should
come
down
to
them
overshadowed
with
clouds
sign
which
they
have
unquestionably
regarded
as
one
of
the
features
of
the
day
of
referring
to
qá
im
and
his
manifestation
strive
therefore
o
my
brother
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
resurrection
and
cleanse
thine
ears
from
the
idle
sayings
of
these
rejected
people
shouldst
thou
step
into
the
realm
of
complete
detachment
thou
wilt
readily
testify
that
no
day
is
mightier
than
this
day
and
that
no
resurrection
more
awful
than
this
resurrection
can
ever
be
conceived
one
righteous
work
performed
in
this
day
equalleth
all
the
virtuous
acts
which
for
myriads
of
centuries
men
have
we
ask
forgiveness
of
god
for
such
a
comparison
for
verily
the
reward
which
such
a
deed
deserveth
is
immensely
beyond
and
above
the
estimate
of
men
inasmuch
as
these
undiscerning
and
wretched
souls
have
failed
to
apprehend
the
true
meaning
of
resurrection
and
of
the
attainment
unto
the
divine
presence
they
therefore
have
remained
utterly
deprived
of
the
grace
thereof
although
the
sole
and
fundamental
purpose
of
all
learning
and
the
toil
and
labour
thereof
is
attainment
unto
and
the
recognition
of
this
station
yet
they
are
all
immersed
in
the
pursuit
of
their
material
studies
they
deny
themselves
every
moment
of
leisure
and
utterly
ignore
him
who
is
the
essence
of
all
learning
and
the
one
object
of
their
quest
methinks
their
lips
have
never
touched
the
cup
of
divine
knowledge
nor
do
they
seem
to
have
attained
even
a
dewdrop
of
the
showers
of
heavenly
grace
consider
how
can
he
that
faileth
in
the
day
of
god
s
revelation
to
attain
unto
the
grace
of
the
divine
presence
and
to
recognize
his
manifestation
be
justly
called
learned
though
he
may
have
spent
aeons
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
and
acquired
all
the
limited
and
material
learning
of
men
it
is
surely
evident
that
he
can
in
no
wise
be
regarded
as
possessed
of
true
knowledge
whereas
the
most
unlettered
of
all
men
if
he
be
honoured
with
this
supreme
distinction
he
verily
is
accounted
as
one
of
those
men
whose
knowledge
is
of
god
for
such
a
man
hath
attained
the
acme
of
knowledge
and
hath
reached
the
furthermost
summit
of
learning
this
station
is
also
one
of
the
signs
of
the
day
of
revelation
even
as
it
is
said
the
abased
amongst
you
he
shall
exalt
and
they
that
are
exalted
he
shall
and
likewise
he
hath
revealed
in
the
qur
án
and
we
desire
to
show
favour
to
those
who
were
brought
low
in
the
land
and
to
make
them
spiritual
leaders
among
men
and
to
make
of
them
our
it
hath
been
witnessed
in
this
day
how
many
of
the
divines
owing
to
their
rejection
of
the
truth
have
fallen
into
and
abide
within
the
uttermost
depths
of
ignorance
and
whose
names
have
been
effaced
from
the
scroll
of
the
glorious
and
learned
and
how
many
of
the
ignorant
who
by
reason
of
their
acceptance
of
the
faith
have
soared
aloft
and
attained
the
high
summit
of
knowledge
and
whose
names
have
been
inscribed
by
the
pen
of
power
upon
the
tablet
of
divine
knowledge
thus
what
he
pleaseth
will
god
abrogate
or
confirm
for
with
him
is
the
source
of
therefore
it
hath
been
said
to
seek
evidence
when
the
proof
hath
been
established
is
but
an
unseemly
act
and
to
be
busied
with
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
when
the
object
of
all
learning
hath
been
attained
is
truly
say
o
people
of
the
earth
behold
this
flamelike
youth
that
speedeth
across
the
limitless
profound
of
the
spirit
heralding
unto
you
the
tidings
lo
the
lamp
of
god
is
shining
and
summoning
you
to
heed
his
cause
which
though
hidden
beneath
the
veils
of
ancient
splendour
shineth
in
the
land
of
iráq
above
the
of
eternal
holiness
o
my
friend
were
the
bird
of
thy
mind
to
explore
the
heavens
of
the
revelation
of
the
qur
án
were
it
to
contemplate
the
realm
of
divine
knowledge
unfolded
therein
thou
wouldst
assuredly
find
unnumbered
doors
of
knowledge
set
open
before
thee
thou
wouldst
certainly
recognize
that
all
these
things
which
have
in
this
day
hindered
this
people
from
attaining
the
shores
of
the
ocean
of
eternal
grace
the
same
things
in
the
muḥammadan
dispensation
prevented
the
people
of
that
age
from
recognizing
that
divine
luminary
and
from
testifying
to
his
truth
thou
wilt
also
apprehend
the
mysteries
of
return
and
revelation
and
wilt
securely
abide
within
the
loftiest
chambers
of
certitude
and
assurance
and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
a
certain
day
a
number
of
the
opponents
of
that
peerless
beauty
those
that
had
strayed
far
from
god
s
imperishable
sanctuary
scornfully
spoke
these
words
unto
muḥammad
verily
god
hath
entered
into
a
covenant
with
us
that
we
are
not
to
credit
an
apostle
until
he
present
us
a
sacrifice
which
fire
out
of
heaven
shall
the
purport
of
this
verse
is
that
god
hath
covenanted
with
them
that
they
should
not
believe
in
any
messenger
unless
he
work
the
miracle
of
abel
and
cain
that
is
offer
a
sacrifice
and
the
fire
from
heaven
consume
it
even
as
they
had
heard
it
recounted
in
the
story
of
abel
which
story
is
recorded
in
the
scriptures
to
this
muḥammad
answering
said
already
have
apostles
before
me
come
to
you
with
sure
testimonies
and
with
that
of
which
ye
speak
wherefore
slew
ye
them
tell
me
if
ye
are
men
of
and
now
be
fair
how
could
those
people
living
in
the
days
of
muḥammad
have
existed
thousands
of
years
before
in
the
age
of
adam
or
other
prophets
why
should
muḥammad
that
essence
of
truthfulness
have
charged
the
people
of
his
day
with
the
murder
of
abel
or
other
prophets
thou
hast
none
other
alternative
except
to
regard
muḥammad
as
an
impostor
or
a
god
forbid
to
maintain
that
those
people
of
wickedness
were
the
people
who
in
every
age
opposed
and
caviled
at
the
prophets
and
messengers
of
god
till
they
finally
caused
them
all
to
suffer
martyrdom
ponder
this
in
thine
heart
that
the
sweet
gales
of
divine
knowledge
blowing
from
the
meads
of
mercy
may
waft
upon
thee
the
fragrance
of
the
beloved
s
utterance
and
cause
thy
soul
to
attain
the
ridván
of
understanding
as
the
wayward
of
every
age
have
failed
to
fathom
the
deeper
import
of
these
weighty
and
pregnant
utterances
and
imagined
the
answer
of
the
prophets
of
god
to
be
irrelevant
to
the
questions
they
asked
them
they
therefore
have
attributed
ignorance
and
folly
to
those
essences
of
knowledge
and
understanding
likewise
muḥammad
in
another
verse
uttereth
his
protest
against
the
people
of
that
age
he
saith
although
they
had
before
prayed
for
victory
over
those
who
believed
not
yet
when
there
came
unto
them
he
of
whom
they
had
knowledge
they
disbelieved
in
him
the
curse
of
god
on
the
infidels
reflect
how
this
verse
also
implieth
that
the
people
living
in
the
days
of
muḥammad
were
the
same
people
who
in
the
days
of
the
prophets
of
old
contended
and
fought
in
order
to
promote
the
faith
and
teach
the
cause
of
god
and
yet
how
could
the
generations
living
at
the
time
of
jesus
and
moses
and
those
who
lived
in
the
days
of
muḥammad
be
regarded
as
being
actually
one
and
the
same
people
moreover
those
whom
they
had
formerly
known
were
moses
the
revealer
of
the
pentateuch
and
jesus
the
author
of
the
gospel
notwithstanding
why
did
muḥammad
say
when
he
of
whom
they
had
knowledge
came
unto
them
is
jesus
or
they
disbelieved
in
him
was
not
muḥammad
to
outward
seeming
called
by
a
different
name
did
he
not
come
forth
out
of
a
different
city
did
he
not
speak
a
different
language
and
reveal
a
different
law
how
then
can
the
truth
of
this
verse
be
established
and
its
meaning
be
made
clear
strive
therefore
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
return
which
hath
been
so
explicitly
revealed
in
the
qur
án
itself
and
which
none
hath
as
yet
understood
what
sayest
thou
if
thou
sayest
that
muḥammad
was
the
return
of
the
prophets
of
old
as
is
witnessed
by
this
verse
his
companions
must
likewise
be
the
return
of
the
bygone
companions
even
as
the
return
of
the
former
people
is
clearly
attested
by
the
text
of
the
verses
and
if
thou
deniest
this
thou
hast
surely
repudiated
the
truth
of
the
qur
án
the
surest
testimony
of
god
unto
men
in
like
manner
endeavour
to
grasp
the
significance
of
return
revelation
and
resurrection
as
witnessed
in
the
days
of
the
manifestations
of
the
divine
essence
that
thou
mayest
behold
with
thine
own
eyes
the
return
of
the
holy
souls
into
sanctified
and
illumined
bodies
and
mayest
wash
away
the
dust
of
ignorance
and
cleanse
the
darkened
self
with
the
waters
of
mercy
flowing
from
the
source
of
divine
knowledge
that
perchance
thou
mayest
through
the
power
of
god
and
the
light
of
divine
guidance
distinguish
the
morn
of
everlasting
splendour
from
the
darksome
night
of
error
furthermore
it
is
evident
to
thee
that
the
bearers
of
the
trust
of
god
are
made
manifest
unto
the
peoples
of
the
earth
as
the
exponents
of
a
new
cause
and
the
bearers
of
a
new
message
inasmuch
as
these
birds
of
the
celestial
throne
are
all
sent
down
from
the
heaven
of
the
will
of
god
and
as
they
all
arise
to
proclaim
his
irresistible
faith
they
therefore
are
regarded
as
one
soul
and
the
same
person
for
they
all
drink
from
the
one
cup
of
the
love
of
god
and
all
partake
of
the
fruit
of
the
same
tree
of
oneness
these
manifestations
of
god
have
each
a
twofold
station
one
is
the
station
of
pure
abstraction
and
essential
unity
in
this
respect
if
thou
callest
them
all
by
one
name
and
dost
ascribe
to
them
the
same
attribute
thou
hast
not
erred
from
the
truth
even
as
he
hath
revealed
no
distinction
do
we
make
between
any
of
his
messengers
for
they
one
and
all
summon
the
people
of
the
earth
to
acknowledge
the
unity
of
god
and
herald
unto
them
the
kawthar
of
an
infinite
grace
and
bounty
they
are
all
invested
with
the
robe
of
prophethood
and
honoured
with
the
mantle
of

thus
hath
muḥammad
the
point
of
the
qur
án
revealed
i
am
all
the
likewise
he
saith
i
am
the
first
adam
noah
moses
and
similar
statements
have
been
made
by
alí
sayings
such
as
this
which
indicate
the
essential
unity
of
those
exponents
of
oneness
have
also
emanated
from
the
channels
of
god
s
immortal
utterance
and
the
treasuries
of
the
gems
of
divine
knowledge
and
have
been
recorded
in
the
scriptures
these
countenances
are
the
recipients
of
the
divine
command
and
the
of
his
revelation
this
revelation
is
exalted
above
the
veils
of
plurality
and
the
exigencies
of
number
thus
he
saith
our
cause
is
but
inasmuch
as
the
cause
is
one
and
the
same
the
exponents
thereof
also
must
needs
be
one
and
the
same
likewise
the
imáms
of
the
muḥammadan
faith
those
lamps
of
certitude
have
said
muḥammad
is
our
first
muḥammad
our
last
muḥammad
our
it
is
clear
and
evident
to
thee
that
all
the
prophets
are
the
temples
of
the
cause
of
god
who
have
appeared
clothed
in
divers
attire
if
thou
wilt
observe
with
discriminating
eyes
thou
wilt
behold
them
all
abiding
in
the
same
tabernacle
soaring
in
the
same
heaven
seated
upon
the
same
throne
uttering
the
same
speech
and
proclaiming
the
same
faith
such
is
the
unity
of
those
essences
of
being
those
luminaries
of
infinite
and
immeasurable
splendour
wherefore
should
one
of
these
manifestations
of
holiness
proclaim
saying
i
am
the
return
of
all
the
prophets
he
verily
speaketh
the
truth
in
like
manner
in
every
subsequent
revelation
the
return
of
the
former
revelation
is
a
fact
the
truth
of
which
is
firmly
established
inasmuch
as
the
return
of
the
prophets
of
god
as
attested
by
verses
and
traditions
hath
been
conclusively
demonstrated
the
return
of
their
chosen
ones
also
is
therefore
definitely
proven
this
return
is
too
manifest
in
itself
to
require
any
evidence
or
proof
for
instance
consider
that
among
the
prophets
was
noah
when
he
was
invested
with
the
robe
of
prophethood
and
was
moved
by
the
spirit
of
god
to
arise
and
proclaim
his
cause
whoever
believed
in
him
and
acknowledged
his
faith
was
endowed
with
the
grace
of
a
new
life
of
him
it
could
be
truly
said
that
he
was
reborn
and
revived
inasmuch
as
previous
to
his
belief
in
god
and
his
acceptance
of
his
manifestation
he
had
set
his
affections
on
the
things
of
the
world
such
as
attachment
to
earthly
goods
to
wife
children
food
drink
and
the
like
so
much
so
that
in
the
and
in
the
night
season
his
one
concern
had
been
to
amass
riches
and
procure
for
himself
the
means
of
enjoyment
and
pleasure
aside
from
these
things
before
his
partaking
of
the
reviving
waters
of
faith
he
had
been
so
wedded
to
the
traditions
of
his
forefathers
and
so
passionately
devoted
to
the
observance
of
their
customs
and
laws
that
he
would
have
preferred
to
suffer
death
rather
than
violate
one
letter
of
those
superstitious
forms
and
manners
current
amongst
his
people
even
as
the
people
have
cried
verily
we
found
our
fathers
with
a
faith
and
verily
in
their
footsteps
we
these
same
people
though
wrapt
in
all
these
veils
of
limitation
and
despite
the
restraint
of
such
observances
as
soon
as
they
drank
the
immortal
draught
of
faith
from
the
cup
of
certitude
at
the
hand
of
the
manifestation
of
the
were
so
transformed
that
they
would
renounce
for
his
sake
their
kindred
their
substance
their
lives
their
beliefs
yea
all
else
save
god
so
overpowering
was
their
yearning
for
god
so
uplifting
their
transports
of
ecstatic
delight
that
the
world
and
all
that
is
therein
faded
before
their
eyes
into
nothingness
have
not
this
people
exemplified
the
mysteries
of
rebirth
and
return
hath
it
not
been
witnessed
that
these
same
people
ere
they
were
endued
with
the
new
and
wondrous
grace
of
god
sought
through
innumerable
devices
to
ensure
the
protection
of
their
lives
against
destruction
would
not
a
thorn
fill
them
with
terror
and
the
sight
of
a
fox
put
them
to
flight
but
once
having
been
honoured
with
god
s
supreme
distinction
and
having
been
vouchsafed
his
bountiful
grace
they
would
if
they
were
able
have
freely
offered
up
ten
thousand
lives
in
his
path
nay
their
blessed
souls
contemptuous
of
the
cage
of
their
bodies
would
yearn
for
deliverance
a
single
warrior
of
that
host
would
face
and
fight
a
multitude
and
yet
how
could
they
but
for
the
transformation
wrought
in
their
lives
be
capable
of
manifesting
such
deeds
which
are
contrary
to
the
ways
of
men
and
incompatible
with
their
worldly
desires
it
is
evident
that
nothing
short
of
this
mystic
transformation
could
cause
such
spirit
and
behaviour
so
utterly
unlike
their
previous
habits
and
manners
to
be
made
manifest
in
the
world
of
being
for
their
agitation
was
turned
into
peace
their
doubt
into
certitude
their
timidity
into
courage
such
is
the
potency
of
the
divine
elixir
which
swift
as
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
transmuteth
the
souls
of
men
for
instance
consider
the
substance
of
copper
were
it
to
be
protected
in
its
own
mine
from
becoming
solidified
it
would
within
the
space
of
seventy
years
attain
to
the
state
of
gold
there
are
some
however
who
maintain
that
copper
itself
is
gold
which
by
becoming
solidified
is
in
a
diseased
condition
and
hath
not
therefore
reached
its
own
state
be
that
as
it
may
the
real
elixir
will
in
one
instant
cause
the
substance
of
copper
to
attain
the
state
of
gold
and
will
traverse
the
stages
in
a
single
moment
could
this
gold
be
called
copper
could
it
be
claimed
that
it
hath
not
attained
the
state
of
gold
whilst
the
is
at
hand
to
assay
it
and
distinguish
it
from
copper
likewise
these
souls
through
the
potency
of
the
divine
elixir
traverse
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
world
of
dust
and
advance
into
the
realm
of
holiness
and
with
one
step
cover
the
earth
of
limitations
and
reach
the
domain
of
the
placeless
it
behooveth
thee
to
exert
thine
utmost
to
attain
unto
this
elixir
which
in
one
fleeting
breath
causeth
the
west
of
ignorance
to
reach
the
east
of
knowledge
illuminates
the
darkness
of
night
with
the
resplendence
of
the
morn
guideth
the
wanderer
in
the
wilderness
of
doubt
to
the
of
the
divine
presence
and
fount
of
certitude
and
conferreth
upon
mortal
souls
the
honour
of
acceptance
into
the
ridván
of
immortality
now
could
this
gold
be
thought
to
be
copper
these
people
could
likewise
be
thought
to
be
the
same
as
before
they
were
endowed
with
faith
o
brother
behold
how
the
inner
mysteries
of
rebirth
of
return
and
of
resurrection
have
each
through
these
these
unanswerable
and
conclusive
utterances
been
unveiled
and
unravelled
before
thine
eyes
god
grant
that
through
his
gracious
and
invisible
assistance
thou
mayest
divest
thy
body
and
soul
of
the
old
garment
and
array
thyself
with
the
new
and
imperishable
attire
therefore
those
who
in
every
subsequent
dispensation
preceded
the
rest
of
mankind
in
embracing
the
faith
of
god
who
quaffed
the
clear
waters
of
knowledge
at
the
hand
of
the
divine
beauty
and
attained
the
loftiest
summits
of
faith
and
certitude
these
can
be
regarded
in
name
in
reality
in
deeds
in
words
and
in
rank
as
the
return
of
those
who
in
a
former
dispensation
had
achieved
similar
distinctions
for
whatsoever
the
people
of
a
former
dispensation
have
manifested
the
same
hath
been
shown
by
the
people
of
this
latter
generation
consider
the
rose
whether
it
blossometh
in
the
east
or
in
the
west
it
is
none
the
less
a
rose
for
what
mattereth
in
this
respect
is
not
the
outward
shape
and
form
of
the
rose
but
rather
the
smell
and
fragrance
which
it
doth
impart
purge
thy
sight
therefore
from
all
earthly
limitations
that
thou
mayest
behold
them
all
as
the
bearers
of
one
name
the
exponents
of
one
cause
the
manifestations
of
one
self
and
the
revealers
of
one
truth
and
that
thou
mayest
apprehend
the
mystic
return
of
the
words
of
god
as
unfolded
by
these
utterances
reflect
for
a
while
upon
the
behaviour
of
the
companions
of
the
muḥammadan
dispensation
consider
how
through
the
reviving
breath
of
muḥammad
they
were
cleansed
from
the
defilements
of
earthly
vanities
were
delivered
from
selfish
desires
and
were
detached
from
all
else
but
him
behold
how
they
preceded
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
in
attaining
unto
his
holy
presence
of
god
they
renounced
the
world
and
all
that
is
therein
and
sacrificed
freely
and
joyously
their
lives
at
the
feet
of
that
manifestation
of
the
and
now
observe
the
return
of
the
determination
the
constancy
and
renunciation
manifested
by
the
companions
of
the
point
of
the
bayán
thou
hast
witnessed
how
these
companions
have
through
the
wonders
of
the
grace
of
the
lord
of
lords
hoisted
the
standards
of
sublime
renunciation
upon
the
inaccessible
heights
of
glory
these
lights
have
proceeded
from
but
one
source
and
these
fruits
are
the
fruits
of
one
tree
thou
canst
discern
neither
difference
nor
distinction
among
them
all
this
is
by
the
grace
of
god
on
whom
he
will
he
bestoweth
his
grace
please
god
that
we
avoid
the
land
of
denial
and
advance
into
the
ocean
of
acceptance
so
that
we
may
perceive
with
an
eye
purged
from
all
conflicting
elements
the
worlds
of
unity
and
diversity
of
variation
and
oneness
of
limitation
and
detachment
and
wing
our
flight
unto
the
highest
and
innermost
sanctuary
of
the
inner
meaning
of
the
word
of
god
from
these
statements
therefore
it
hath
been
made
evident
and
manifest
that
should
a
soul
in
the
end
that
knoweth
no
end
be
made
manifest
and
arise
to
proclaim
and
uphold
a
cause
which
in
the
beginning
that
hath
no
beginning
another
soul
had
proclaimed
and
upheld
it
can
be
truly
declared
of
him
who
is
the
last
and
of
him
who
was
the
first
that
they
are
one
and
the
same
inasmuch
as
both
are
the
exponents
of
one
and
the
same
cause
for
this
reason
hath
the
point
of
the
the
life
of
all
else
but
him
be
his
sacrifice
the
manifestations
of
god
unto
the
sun
which
though
it
rise
from
the
beginning
that
hath
no
beginning
until
the
end
that
knoweth
no
end
is
none
the
less
the
same
sun
now
wert
thou
to
say
that
this
sun
is
the
former
sun
thou
speakest
the
truth
and
if
thou
sayest
that
this
sun
is
the
return
of
that
sun
thou
also
speakest
the
truth
likewise
from
this
statement
it
is
made
evident
that
the
term
last
is
applicable
to
the
first
and
the
term
first
applicable
to
the
last
inasmuch
as
both
the
first
and
the
last
have
risen
to
proclaim
one
and
the
same
faith
notwithstanding
the
obviousness
of
this
theme
in
the
eyes
of
those
that
have
quaffed
the
wine
of
knowledge
and
certitude
yet
how
many
are
those
who
through
failure
to
understand
its
meaning
have
allowed
the
term
seal
of
the
prophets
to
obscure
their
understanding
and
deprive
them
of
the
grace
of
all
his
manifold
bounties
hath
not
muḥammad
himself
declared
i
am
all
the
prophets
hath
he
not
said
as
we
have
already
mentioned
i
am
adam
noah
moses
and
jesus
why
should
muḥammad
that
immortal
beauty
who
hath
said
i
am
the
first
adam
be
incapable
of
saying
also
i
am
the
last
adam
for
even
as
he
regarded
himself
to
be
the
first
of
the
prophets
is
like
manner
the
seal
of
the
prophets
is
also
applicable
unto
that
divine
beauty
it
is
admittedly
obvious
that
being
the
first
of
the
prophets
he
likewise
is
their
the
mystery
of
this
theme
hath
in
this
dispensation
been
a
sore
test
unto
all
mankind
behold
how
many
are
those
who
clinging
unto
these
words
have
disbelieved
him
who
is
their
true
revealer
what
we
ask
could
this
people
presume
the
terms
first
and
last
referring
to
be
his
name
mean
if
they
maintain
that
these
terms
bear
reference
to
this
material
universe
how
could
it
be
possible
when
the
visible
order
of
things
is
still
manifestly
existing
nay
in
this
instance
by
first
is
meant
no
other
than
the
last
and
by
last
no
other
than
the
even
as
in
the
beginning
that
hath
no
beginnings
the
term
last
is
truly
applicable
unto
him
who
is
the
educator
of
the
visible
and
of
the
invisible
in
like
manner
are
the
terms
first
and
last
applicable
unto
his
manifestations
they
are
at
the
same
time
the
exponents
of
both
the
first
and
the
whilst
established
upon
the
seat
of
the
first
they
occupy
the
throne
of
the
were
a
discerning
eye
to
be
found
it
will
readily
perceive
that
the
exponents
of
the
first
and
the
last
of
the
manifest
and
the
hidden
of
the
beginning
and
the
seal
are
none
other
than
these
holy
beings
these
essences
of
detachment
these
divine
souls
and
wert
thou
to
soar
in
the
holy
realm
of
god
was
alone
there
was
none
else
besides
him
thou
wilt
find
in
that
court
all
these
names
utterly
and
completely
forgotten
then
will
thine
eyes
no
longer
be
obscured
by
these
veils
these
terms
and
allusions
how
ethereal
and
lofty
is
this
station
unto
which
even
gabriel
unshepherded
can
never
attain
and
the
bird
of
heaven
unassisted
can
never
reach
and
now
strive
thou
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
this
saying
of
alí
the
commander
of
the
faithful
piercing
the
veils
of
glory
among
these
veils
of
glory
are
the
divines
and
doctors
living
in
the
days
of
the
manifestation
of
god
who
because
of
their
want
of
discernment
and
their
love
and
eagerness
for
leadership
have
failed
to
submit
to
the
cause
of
god
nay
have
even
refused
to
incline
their
ears
unto
the
divine
melody
they
have
thrust
their
fingers
into
their
and
the
people
also
utterly
ignoring
god
and
taking
them
for
their
masters
have
placed
themselves
unreservedly
under
the
authority
of
these
pompous
and
hypocritical
leaders
for
they
have
no
sight
no
hearing
no
heart
of
their
own
to
distinguish
truth
from
falsehood
notwithstanding
the
admonitions
of
all
the
prophets
the
saints
and
chosen
ones
of
god
enjoining
the
people
to
see
with
their
own
eyes
and
hear
with
their
own
ears
they
have
disdainfully
rejected
their
counsels
and
have
blindly
followed
and
will
continue
to
follow
the
leaders
of
their
faith
should
a
poor
and
obscure
person
destitute
of
the
attire
of
men
of
learning
address
them
saying
follow
ye
o
people
the
messengers
of
god
they
would
greatly
surprised
at
such
a
statement
reply
what
meanest
thou
that
all
these
divines
all
these
exponents
of
learning
with
all
their
authority
their
pomp
and
pageantry
have
erred
and
failed
to
distinguish
truth
from
falsehood
dost
thou
and
people
like
thyself
pretend
to
have
comprehended
that
which
they
have
not
understood
if
numbers
and
excellence
of
apparel
be
regarded
as
the
criterions
of
learning
and
truth
the
peoples
of
a
bygone
age
whom
those
of
today
have
never
surpassed
in
numbers
magnificence
and
power
should
certainly
be
accounted
a
superior
and
worthier
people
it
is
clear
and
evident
that
whenever
the
manifestations
of
holiness
were
revealed
the
divines
of
their
day
have
hindered
the
people
from
attaining
unto
the
way
of
truth
to
this
testify
the
records
of
all
the
scriptures
and
heavenly
books
not
one
prophet
of
god
was
made
manifest
who
did
not
fall
a
victim
to
the
relentless
hate
to
the
denunciation
denial
and
execration
of
the
clerics
of
his
day
woe
unto
them
for
the
iniquities
their
hands
have
formerly
wrought
woe
unto
them
for
that
which
they
are
now
doing
what
veils
of
glory
more
grievous
than
these
embodiments
of
error
by
the
righteousness
of
god
to
pierce
such
veils
is
the
mightiest
of
all
acts
and
to
rend
them
asunder
the
most
meritorious
of
all
deeds
may
god
assist
us
and
assist
you
o
concourse
of
the
spirit
that
perchance
ye
may
in
the
time
of
his
manifestation
be
graciously
aided
to
perform
such
deeds
and
may
in
his
days
attain
unto
the
presence
of
god
furthermore
among
the
veils
of
glory
are
such
terms
as
the
seal
of
the
prophets
and
the
like
the
removal
of
which
is
a
supreme
achievement
in
the
sight
of
these
and
erring
souls
all
by
reason
of
these
mysterious
sayings
these
grievous
veils
of
glory
have
been
hindered
from
beholding
the
light
of
truth
have
they
not
heard
the
melody
of
that
bird
of
heaven
uttering
this
mystery
a
thousand
fátimihs
i
have
espoused
all
of
whom
were
the
daughters
of
muḥammad
son
of
abdu
lláh
the
seal
of
the
prophets
behold
how
many
are
the
mysteries
that
lie
as
yet
unravelled
within
the
tabernacle
of
the
knowledge
of
god
and
how
numerous
the
gems
of
his
wisdom
that
are
still
concealed
in
his
inviolable
treasuries
shouldest
thou
ponder
this
in
thine
heart
thou
wouldst
realize
that
his
handiwork
knoweth
neither
beginning
nor
end
the
domain
of
his
decree
is
too
vast
for
the
tongue
of
mortals
to
describe
or
for
the
bird
of
the
human
mind
to
traverse
and
the
dispensations
of
his
providence
are
too
mysterious
for
the
mind
of
man
to
comprehend
his
creation
no
end
hath
overtaken
and
it
hath
ever
existed
from
the
beginning
that
hath
no
beginning
and
the
manifestations
of
his
beauty
no
beginning
hath
beheld
and
they
will
continue
to
the
end
that
knoweth
no
ponder
this
utterance
in
thine
heart
and
reflect
how
it
is
applicable
unto
all
these
holy
souls
likewise
strive
thou
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
melody
of
that
eternal
beauty
ḥusayn
son
of
alí
who
addressing
salmán
spoke
words
such
as
these
i
was
with
a
thousand
adams
the
interval
between
each
and
the
next
adam
was
fifty
thousand
years
and
to
each
one
of
these
i
declared
the
successorship
conferred
upon
my
he
then
recounteth
certain
details
until
he
saith
i
have
fought
one
thousand
battles
in
the
path
of
god
the
least
and
most
insignificant
of
which
was
like
the
battle
of
in
which
battle
my
father
fought
and
contended
against
the
endeavour
now
to
apprehend
from
these
two
traditions
the
mysteries
of
end
return
and
creation
without
beginning
or
o
my
beloved
immeasurably
exalted
is
the
celestial
melody
above
the
strivings
of
human
ear
to
hear
or
mind
to
grasp
its
mystery
how
can
the
helpless
ant
step
into
the
court
of
the
and
yet
feeble
souls
through
lack
of
understanding
reject
these
abstruse
utterances
and
question
the
truth
of
such
traditions
nay
none
can
comprehend
them
save
those
that
are
possessed
of
an
understanding
heart
say
he
is
that
end
for
whom
no
end
in
all
the
universe
can
be
imagined
and
for
whom
no
beginning
in
the
world
of
creation
can
be
conceived
behold
o
concourse
of
the
earth
the
splendours
of
the
end
revealed
in
the
manifestations
of
the
beginning
how
strange
these
people
with
one
hand
cling
to
those
verses
of
the
qur
án
and
those
traditions
of
the
people
of
certitude
which
they
have
found
to
accord
with
their
inclinations
and
interests
and
with
the
other
reject
those
which
are
contrary
to
their
selfish
desires
believe
ye
then
part
of
the
book
and
deny
part
how
could
ye
judge
that
which
ye
understand
not
even
as
the
lord
of
being
hath
in
his
unerring
book
after
speaking
of
the
seal
in
his
exalted
utterance
muḥammad
is
the
apostle
of
god
and
the
seal
of
the
prophets
hath
revealed
unto
all
people
the
promise
of
attainment
unto
the
divine
to
this
attainment
to
the
presence
of
the
immortal
king
testify
the
verses
of
the
book
some
of
which
we
have
already
mentioned
the
one
true
god
is
my
witness
nothing
more
exalted
or
more
explicit
than
attainment
unto
the
divine
presence
hath
been
revealed
in
the
qur
án
well
is
it
with
him
that
hath
attained
thereunto
in
the
day
wherein
most
of
the
people
even
as
ye
witness
have
turned
away
therefrom
and
yet
through
the
mystery
of
the
former
verse
they
have
turned
away
from
the
grace
promised
by
the
latter
despite
the
fact
that
attainment
unto
the
divine
presence
in
the
day
of
resurrection
is
explicitly
stated
in
the
book
it
hath
been
demonstrated
and
definitely
established
through
clear
evidences
that
by
resurrection
is
meant
the
rise
of
the
manifestation
of
god
to
proclaim
his
cause
and
by
attainment
unto
the
divine
presence
is
meant
attainment
unto
the
presence
of
his
beauty
in
the
person
of
his
manifestation
for
verily
no
vision
taketh
in
him
but
he
taketh
in
all
notwithstanding
all
these
indubitable
facts
and
lucid
statements
they
have
foolishly
clung
to
the
term
seal
and
remained
utterly
deprived
of
the
recognition
of
him
who
is
the
revealer
of
both
the
seal
and
the
beginning
in
the
day
of
his
presence
if
god
should
chastise
men
for
their
perverse
doings
he
would
not
leave
upon
the
earth
a
moving
thing
but
to
an
appointed
time
doth
he
respite
but
apart
from
all
these
things
had
this
people
attained
unto
a
drop
of
the
crystal
streams
flowing
from
the
words
god
doeth
whatsoever
he
willeth
and
ordaineth
whatsoever
he
pleaseth
they
would
not
have
raised
any
unseemly
cavils
such
as
these
against
the
focal
center
of
his
revelation
the
cause
of
god
all
deeds
and
words
are
held
within
the
grasp
of
his
power
all
things
lie
imprisoned
within
the
hollow
of
his
mighty
hand
all
things
are
easy
and
possible
unto
he
accomplisheth
whatsoever
he
willeth
and
doeth
all
that
he
desireth
whoso
sayeth
why
or
wherefore
hath
spoken
blasphemy
were
these
people
to
shake
off
the
slumber
of
negligence
and
realize
that
which
their
hands
have
wrought
they
would
surely
perish
and
would
of
their
own
accord
cast
themselves
into
end
and
real
abode
have
they
not
heard
that
which
he
hath
revealed
he
shall
not
be
asked
of
his
doings
in
the
light
of
these
utterances
how
can
man
be
so
bold
as
to
question
him
and
busy
himself
with
idle
sayings
gracious
god
so
great
is
the
folly
and
perversity
of
the
people
that
they
have
turned
their
face
toward
their
own
thoughts
and
desires
and
have
turned
their
back
upon
the
knowledge
and
will
of
and
glorified
be
his
name
be
fair
were
these
people
to
acknowledge
the
truth
of
these
luminous
words
and
holy
allusions
and
recognize
god
as
him
that
doeth
whatsoever
he
pleaseth
how
could
they
continue
to
cleave
unto
these
glaring
absurdities
nay
with
all
their
soul
they
would
accept
and
submit
to
whatsoever
he
saith
i
swear
by
god
but
for
the
divine
decree
and
the
inscrutable
dispensations
of
providence
the
earth
itself
would
have
utterly
destroyed
all
this
people
he
will
however
respite
them
until
the
appointed
time
of
a
known
twelve
hundred
and
eighty
years
have
passed
since
the
dawn
of
the
muḥammadan
dispensation
and
with
every
break
of
day
these
blind
and
ignoble
people
have
recited
their
qur
án
and
yet
have
failed
to
grasp
one
letter
of
that
book
again
and
again
they
read
those
verses
which
clearly
testify
to
the
reality
of
these
holy
themes
and
bear
witness
to
the
truth
of
the
manifestations
of
eternal
glory
and
still
apprehend
not
their
purpose
they
have
even
failed
to
realize
all
this
time
that
in
every
age
the
reading
of
the
scriptures
and
holy
books
is
for
no
other
purpose
except
to
enable
the
reader
to
apprehend
their
meaning
and
unravel
their
innermost
mysteries
otherwise
reading
without
understanding
is
of
no
abiding
profit
unto
man
and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
a
certain
day
a
needy
man
came
to
visit
this
soul
craving
for
the
ocean
of
his
knowledge
while
conversing
with
him
mention
was
made
concerning
the
signs
of
the
day
of
judgment
resurrection
revival
and
reckoning
he
urged
us
to
explain
how
in
this
wondrous
dispensation
the
peoples
of
the
world
were
brought
to
a
reckoning
when
none
were
made
aware
of
it
thereupon
we
imparted
unto
him
according
to
the
measure
of
his
capacity
and
understanding
certain
truths
of
science
and
ancient
wisdom
we
then
asked
him
saying
hast
thou
not
read
the
qur
án
and
art
thou
not
aware
of
this
blessed
verse
on
that
day
shall
neither
man
nor
spirit
be
asked
of
his
sin
dost
thou
not
realize
that
by
asking
is
not
meant
asking
by
tongue
or
speech
even
as
the
verse
itself
doth
indicate
and
prove
for
afterward
it
is
said
by
their
countenance
shall
the
sinners
be
known
and
they
shall
be
seized
by
their
forelocks
and
their
thus
the
peoples
of
the
world
are
judged
by
their
countenance
by
it
their
misbelief
their
faith
and
their
iniquity
are
all
made
manifest
even
as
it
is
evident
in
this
day
how
the
people
of
error
are
by
their
countenance
known
and
distinguished
from
the
followers
of
divine
guidance
were
these
people
wholly
for
the
sake
of
god
and
with
no
desire
but
his
to
ponder
the
verses
of
the
book
in
their
heart
they
would
of
a
certainty
find
whatsoever
they
seek
in
its
verses
would
they
find
revealed
and
manifest
all
the
things
be
they
great
or
small
that
have
come
to
pass
in
this
dispensation
they
would
even
recognize
in
them
references
unto
the
departure
of
the
manifestations
of
the
names
and
attributes
of
god
from
out
their
native
land
to
the
opposition
and
disdainful
arrogance
of
government
and
people
and
to
the
dwelling
and
establishment
of
the
universal
manifestation
in
an
appointed
and
specially
designated
land
no
man
however
can
comprehend
this
except
he
who
is
possessed
of
an
understanding
heart
we
seal
our
theme
with
that
which
was
formerly
revealed
unto
muḥammad
that
the
seal
thereof
may
shed
the
fragrance
of
that
holy
musk
which
leadeth
men
unto
the
ridván
of
unfading
splendour
he
said
and
his
word
is
the
truth
and
god
calleth
to
the
abode
of
peace
and
he
guideth
whom
he
will
into
the
right
for
them
is
an
abode
of
peace
with
their
lord
and
he
shall
be
their
protector
because
of
their
this
he
hath
revealed
that
his
grace
may
encompass
the
world
praise
be
to
god
the
lord
of
all
being
we
have
variously
and
repeatedly
set
forth
the
meaning
of
every
theme
that
perchance
every
soul
whether
high
or
low
may
obtain
according
to
his
measure
and
capacity
his
share
and
portion
thereof
should
he
be
unable
to
comprehend
a
certain
argument
he
may
thus
by
referring
unto
another
attain
his
purpose
that
all
sorts
of
men
may
know
where
to
quench
their
by
god
this
bird
of
heaven
now
dwelling
upon
the
dust
can
besides
these
melodies
utter
a
myriad
songs
and
is
able
apart
from
these
utterances
to
unfold
innumerable
mysteries
every
single
note
of
its
unpronounced
utterances
is
immeasurably
exalted
above
all
that
hath
already
been
revealed
and
immensely
glorified
beyond
that
which
hath
streamed
from
this
pen
let
the
future
disclose
the
hour
when
the
brides
of
inner
meaning
will
as
decreed
by
the
will
of
god
hasten
forth
unveiled
out
of
their
mystic
mansions
and
manifest
themselves
in
the
ancient
realm
of
being
nothing
whatsoever
is
possible
without
his
permission
no
power
can
endure
save
through
his
power
and
there
is
none
other
god
but
he
his
is
the
world
of
creation
and
his
the
cause
of
god
all
proclaim
his
revelation
and
all
unfold
the
mysteries
of
his
spirit
we
have
already
in
the
foregoing
pages
assigned
two
stations
unto
each
of
the
luminaries
arising
from
the
daysprings
of
eternal
holiness
one
of
these
stations
the
station
of
essential
unity
we
have
already
explained
no
distinction
do
we
make
between
any
of
the
other
is
the
station
of
distinction
and
pertaineth
to
the
world
of
creation
and
to
the
limitations
thereof
in
this
respect
each
manifestation
of
god
hath
a
distinct
individuality
a
definitely
prescribed
mission
a
predestined
revelation
and
specially
designated
limitations
each
one
of
them
is
known
by
a
different
name
is
characterized
by
a
special
attribute
fulfils
a
definite
mission
and
is
entrusted
with
a
particular
revelation
even
as
he
saith
some
of
the
apostles
we
have
caused
to
excel
the
others
to
some
god
hath
spoken
some
he
hath
raised
and
exalted
and
to
jesus
son
of
mary
we
gave
manifest
signs
and
we
strengthened
him
with
the
holy
it
is
because
of
this
difference
in
their
station
and
mission
that
the
words
and
utterances
flowing
from
these
of
divine
knowledge
appear
to
diverge
and
differ
otherwise
in
the
eyes
of
them
that
are
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
divine
wisdom
all
their
utterances
are
in
reality
but
the
expressions
of
one
truth
as
most
of
the
people
have
failed
to
appreciate
those
stations
to
which
we
have
referred
they
therefore
feel
perplexed
and
dismayed
at
the
varying
utterances
pronounced
by
manifestations
that
are
essentially
one
and
the
same
it
hath
ever
been
evident
that
all
these
divergences
of
utterance
are
attributable
to
differences
of
station
thus
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
their
oneness
and
sublime
detachment
the
attributes
of
godhead
divinity
supreme
singleness
and
inmost
essence
have
been
and
are
applicable
to
those
essences
of
being
inasmuch
as
they
all
abide
on
the
throne
of
divine
revelation
and
are
established
upon
the
seat
of
divine
concealment
through
their
appearance
the
revelation
of
god
is
made
manifest
and
by
their
countenance
the
beauty
of
god
is
revealed
thus
it
is
that
the
accents
of
god
himself
have
been
heard
uttered
by
these
manifestations
of
the
divine
being
viewed
in
the
light
of
their
second
station
of
distinction
differentiation
temporal
limitations
characteristics
and
standards
manifest
absolute
servitude
utter
destitution
and
complete
even
as
he
saith
i
am
the
servant
of
god
i
am
but
a
man
like
from
these
incontrovertible
and
fully
demonstrated
statements
strive
thou
to
apprehend
the
meaning
of
the
questions
thou
hast
asked
that
thou
mayest
become
steadfast
in
the
faith
of
god
and
not
be
dismayed
by
the
divergences
in
the
utterances
of
his
prophets
and
chosen
ones
were
any
of
the
manifestations
of
god
to
declare
i
am
god
he
verily
speaketh
the
truth
and
no
doubt
attacheth
thereto
for
it
hath
been
repeatedly
demonstrated
that
through
their
revelation
their
attributes
and
names
the
revelation
of
god
his
name
and
his
attributes
are
made
manifest
in
the
world
thus
he
hath
revealed
those
shafts
were
god
s
not
thine
and
also
he
saith
in
truth
they
who
plighted
fealty
unto
thee
really
plighted
that
fealty
unto
and
were
any
of
them
to
voice
the
utterance
i
am
the
messenger
of
god
he
also
speaketh
the
truth
the
indubitable
truth
even
as
he
saith
muḥammad
is
not
the
father
of
any
man
among
you
but
he
is
the
messenger
of
viewed
in
this
light
they
are
all
but
messengers
of
that
ideal
king
that
unchangeable
essence
and
were
they
all
to
proclaim
i
am
the
seal
of
the
prophets
they
verily
utter
but
the
truth
beyond
the
faintest
shadow
of
doubt
for
they
are
all
but
one
person
one
soul
one
spirit
one
being
one
revelation
they
are
all
the
manifestation
of
the
beginning
and
the
end
the
first
and
the
last
the
seen
and
hidden
of
which
pertain
to
him
who
is
the
innermost
spirit
of
spirits
and
eternal
essence
of
essences
and
were
they
to
say
we
are
the
servants
of
god
this
also
is
a
manifest
and
indisputable
fact
for
they
have
been
made
manifest
in
the
uttermost
state
of
servitude
a
servitude
the
like
of
which
no
man
can
possibly
attain
thus
in
moments
in
which
these
essences
of
being
were
deeply
immersed
beneath
the
oceans
of
ancient
and
everlasting
holiness
or
when
they
soared
to
the
loftiest
summits
of
divine
mysteries
they
claimed
their
utterance
to
be
the
voice
of
divinity
the
call
of
god
himself
were
the
eye
of
discernment
to
be
opened
it
would
recognize
that
in
this
very
state
they
have
considered
themselves
utterly
effaced
and
in
the
face
of
him
who
is
the
the
incorruptible
methinks
they
have
regarded
themselves
as
utter
nothingness
and
deemed
their
mention
in
that
court
an
act
of
blasphemy
for
the
slightest
whispering
of
self
within
such
a
court
is
an
evidence
of
and
independent
existence
in
the
eyes
of
them
that
have
attained
unto
that
court
such
a
suggestion
is
itself
a
grievous
transgression
how
much
more
grievous
would
it
be
were
aught
else
to
be
mentioned
in
that
presence
were
man
s
heart
his
tongue
his
mind
or
his
soul
to
be
busied
with
anyone
but
the
were
his
eyes
to
behold
any
countenance
other
than
his
beauty
were
his
ear
to
be
inclined
to
any
melody
but
his
voice
and
were
his
feet
to
tread
any
way
but
his
way
in
this
day
the
breeze
of
god
is
wafted
and
his
spirit
hath
pervaded
all
things
such
is
the
outpouring
of
his
grace
that
the
pen
is
stilled
and
the
tongue
is
speechless
by
virtue
of
this
station
they
have
claimed
for
themselves
the
voice
of
divinity
and
the
like
whilst
by
virtue
of
their
station
of
messengership
they
have
declared
themselves
the
messengers
of
god
in
every
instance
they
have
voiced
an
utterance
that
would
conform
to
the
requirements
of
the
occasion
and
have
ascribed
all
these
declarations
to
themselves
declarations
ranging
from
the
realm
of
divine
revelation
to
the
realm
of
creation
and
from
the
domain
of
divinity
even
unto
the
domain
of
earthly
existence
thus
it
is
that
whatsoever
be
their
utterance
whether
it
pertain
to
the
realm
of
divinity
lordship
prophethood
messengership
guardianship
apostleship
or
servitude
all
is
true
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
therefore
these
sayings
which
we
have
quoted
in
support
of
our
argument
must
be
attentively
considered
that
the
divergent
utterances
of
the
manifestations
of
the
unseen
and
daysprings
of
holiness
may
cease
to
agitate
the
soul
and
perplex
the
mind
those
words
uttered
by
the
luminaries
of
truth
must
needs
be
pondered
and
should
their
significance
be
not
grasped
enlightenment
should
be
sought
from
the
trustees
of
the
depositories
of
knowledge
that
these
may
expound
their
meaning
and
unravel
their
mystery
for
it
behooveth
no
man
to
interpret
the
holy
words
according
to
his
own
imperfect
understanding
nor
having
found
them
to
be
contrary
to
his
inclination
and
desires
to
reject
and
repudiate
their
truth
for
such
today
is
the
manner
of
the
divines
and
doctors
of
the
age
who
occupy
the
seats
of
knowledge
and
learning
and
who
have
named
ignorance
knowledge
and
called
oppression
justice
were
these
to
ask
the
light
of
truth
concerning
those
images
which
their
idle
fancy
hath
carved
and
were
they
to
find
his
answer
inconsistent
with
their
own
conceptions
and
their
own
understanding
of
the
book
they
would
assuredly
denounce
him
who
is
the
mine
and
wellhead
of
all
knowledge
as
the
very
negation
of
understanding
such
things
have
happened
in
every
age
for
instance
when
muḥammad
the
lord
of
being
was
questioned
concerning
the
new
moons
he
as
bidden
by
god
made
reply
they
are
periods
appointed
unto
thereupon
they
that
heard
him
denounced
him
as
an
ignorant
man
likewise
in
the
verse
concerning
the
spirit
he
saith
and
they
will
ask
thee
of
the
spirit
say
the
spirit
proceedeth
at
my
lord
s
as
soon
as
muḥammad
s
answer
was
given
they
all
clamorously
protested
saying
lo
an
ignorant
man
who
knoweth
not
what
the
spirit
is
calleth
himself
the
revealer
of
divine
knowledge
and
now
behold
the
divines
of
the
age
who
because
of
their
being
honoured
by
his
name
and
finding
that
their
fathers
have
acknowledged
his
revelation
have
blindly
submitted
to
his
truth
observe
were
this
people
today
to
receive
such
answers
in
reply
to
such
questionings
they
would
unhesitatingly
reject
and
denounce
they
would
again
utter
the
cavils
even
as
they
have
uttered
them
in
this
day
all
this
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
these
essences
of
being
are
immensely
exalted
above
such
fanciful
images
and
are
immeasurably
glorified
beyond
all
these
vain
sayings
and
above
the
comprehension
of
every
understanding
heart
their
learning
when
compared
with
that
knowledge
is
utter
falsehood
and
all
their
understanding
naught
but
blatant
error
nay
whatsoever
proceedeth
from
these
mines
of
divine
wisdom
and
these
treasuries
of
eternal
knowledge
is
truth
and
naught
else
but
the
truth
the
saying
knowledge
is
one
point
which
the
foolish
have
multiplied
is
a
proof
of
our
argument
and
the
tradition
knowledge
is
a
light
which
god
sheddeth
into
the
heart
of
whomsoever
he
willeth
a
confirmation
of
our
statement
inasmuch
as
they
have
not
apprehended
the
meaning
of
knowledge
and
have
called
by
that
name
those
images
fashioned
by
their
own
fancy
and
which
have
sprung
from
the
embodiments
of
ignorance
they
therefore
have
inflicted
upon
the
source
of
knowledge
that
which
thou
hast
heard
and
witnessed
for
instance
a
certain
man
reputed
for
his
learning
and
attainments
and
accounting
himself
as
one
of
the
leaders
of
his
people
hath
in
his
book
denounced
and
vilified
all
the
exponents
of
true
learning
this
is
made
abundantly
clear
by
his
explicit
statements
as
well
as
by
his
allusions
throughout
his
book
as
we
had
frequently
heard
about
him
we
purposed
to
read
some
of
his
works
although
we
never
felt
disposed
to
peruse
other
peoples
writings
yet
as
some
had
questioned
us
concerning
him
we
felt
it
necessary
to
refer
to
his
books
in
order
that
we
might
answer
our
questioners
with
knowledge
and
understanding
his
works
in
the
arabic
tongue
were
however
not
available
until
one
day
a
certain
man
informed
us
that
one
of
his
compositions
entitled
irshadu
avám
could
be
found
in
this
city
from
this
title
we
perceived
the
odour
of
conceit
and
vainglory
inasmuch
as
he
hath
imagined
himself
a
learned
man
and
regarded
the
rest
of
the
people
ignorant
his
worth
was
in
fact
made
known
by
the
very
title
he
had
chosen
for
his
book
it
became
evident
that
its
author
was
following
the
path
of
self
and
desire
and
was
lost
in
the
wilderness
of
ignorance
and
folly
methinks
he
had
forgotten
the
tradition
which
sayeth
knowledge
is
all
that
is
knowable
and
might
and
power
all
notwithstanding
we
sent
for
the
book
and
kept
it
with
us
a
few
days
it
was
probably
referred
to
twice
the
second
time
we
accidentally
came
upon
the
story
of
the
mi
ráj
of
muḥammad
of
whom
was
spoken
but
for
thee
i
would
not
have
created
the
we
noticed
that
he
had
enumerated
some
twenty
or
more
sciences
the
knowledge
of
which
he
considered
to
be
essential
for
the
comprehension
of
the
mystery
of
the
mi
ráj
we
gathered
from
his
statements
that
unless
a
man
be
deeply
versed
in
them
all
he
can
never
attain
to
a
proper
understanding
of
this
transcendent
and
exalted
theme
among
the
specified
sciences
were
the
science
of
metaphysical
abstractions
of
alchemy
and
natural
magic
such
vain
and
discarded
learnings
this
man
hath
regarded
as
the
of
the
understanding
of
the
sacred
and
abiding
mysteries
of
divine
knowledge
gracious
god
such
is
the
measure
of
his
understanding
and
yet
behold
what
cavils
and
calumnies
he
hath
heaped
upon
those
embodiments
of
god
s
infinite
knowledge
how
well
and
true
is
the
saying
flingest
thou
thy
calumnies
unto
the
face
of
them
whom
the
one
true
god
hath
made
the
trustees
of
the
treasures
of
his
seventh
sphere
not
one
understanding
heart
or
mind
not
one
among
the
wise
and
learned
hath
taken
notice
of
these
preposterous
statements
and
yet
how
clear
and
evident
it
is
to
every
discerning
heart
that
this
learning
is
and
hath
ever
been
rejected
by
him
who
is
the
one
true
god
how
can
the
knowledge
of
these
sciences
which
are
so
contemptible
in
the
eyes
of
the
truly
learned
be
regarded
as
essential
to
the
apprehension
of
the
mysteries
of
the
mi
ráj
whilst
the
lord
of
the
mi
ráj
himself
was
never
burdened
with
a
single
letter
of
these
limited
and
obscure
learnings
and
never
defiled
his
radiant
heart
with
any
of
these
fanciful
illusions
how
truly
hath
he
said
all
human
attainment
moveth
upon
a
lame
ass
whilst
truth
riding
upon
the
wind
darteth
across
by
the
righteousness
of
god
whoso
desireth
to
fathom
the
mystery
of
this
mi
ráj
and
craveth
a
drop
from
this
ocean
if
the
mirror
of
his
heart
be
already
obscured
by
the
dust
of
these
learnings
he
must
needs
cleanse
and
purify
it
ere
the
light
of
this
mystery
can
be
reflected
therein
in
this
day
they
that
are
submerged
beneath
the
ocean
of
ancient
knowledge
and
dwell
within
the
ark
of
divine
wisdom
forbid
the
people
such
idle
pursuits
their
shining
breasts
are
praise
be
to
god
sanctified
from
every
trace
of
such
learning
and
are
exalted
above
such
grievous
veils
we
have
consumed
this
densest
of
all
veils
with
the
fire
of
the
love
of
the
veil
referred
to
in
the
saying
the
most
grievous
of
all
veils
is
the
veil
of
upon
its
ashes
we
have
reared
the
tabernacle
of
divine
knowledge
we
have
praise
be
to
god
burned
the
veils
of
glory
with
the
fire
of
the
beauty
of
the
we
have
driven
from
the
human
heart
all
else
but
him
who
is
the
desire
of
the
world
and
glory
therein
we
cleave
to
no
knowledge
but
his
knowledge
and
set
our
hearts
on
naught
save
the
effulgent
glories
of
his
light
we
were
surprised
exceedingly
when
we
observed
that
his
one
purpose
was
to
make
the
people
realize
that
all
these
learnings
were
possessed
by
him
and
yet
i
swear
by
god
that
not
one
breath
blowing
from
the
meads
of
divine
knowledge
hath
ever
been
wafted
upon
his
soul
nor
hath
he
ever
unravelled
a
single
mystery
of
ancient
wisdom
nay
were
the
meaning
of
knowledge
ever
to
be
expounded
unto
him
dismay
would
fill
his
heart
and
his
whole
being
would
shake
to
its
foundation
notwithstanding
his
base
and
senseless
statements
behold
to
what
heights
of
extravagance
his
claims
have
reached
gracious
god
how
great
is
our
amazement
at
the
way
the
people
have
gathered
around
him
and
have
borne
allegiance
to
his
person
content
with
transient
dust
these
people
have
turned
their
face
unto
it
and
cast
behind
their
backs
him
who
is
the
lord
of
lords
satisfied
with
the
croaking
of
the
crow
and
enamoured
with
the
visage
of
the
raven
they
have
renounced
the
melody
of
the
nightingale
and
the
charm
of
the
rose
what
unspeakable
fallacies
the
perusal
of
this
pretentious
book
hath
revealed
they
are
too
unworthy
for
any
pen
to
describe
and
too
base
for
one
moment
s
attention
should
a
touchstone
be
found
however
it
would
instantly
distinguish
truth
from
falsehood
light
from
darkness
and
sun
from
shadow
among
the
sciences
which
this
pretender
hath
professed
is
that
of
alchemy
we
cherish
the
hope
that
either
a
king
or
a
man
of
preeminent
power
may
call
upon
him
to
translate
this
science
from
the
realm
of
fancy
to
the
domain
of
fact
and
from
the
plane
of
mere
pretension
to
that
of
actual
achievement
would
that
this
unlearned
and
humble
servant
who
never
laid
any
pretension
to
such
things
nor
even
regarded
them
as
the
criterion
of
true
knowledge
might
undertake
the
same
task
that
thereby
the
truth
might
be
known
and
distinguished
from
falsehood
but
of
what
avail
all
this
generation
could
offer
us
were
wounds
from
its
darts
and
the
only
cup
it
proffered
to
our
lips
was
the
cup
of
its
venom
on
our
neck
we
still
bear
the
scar
of
chains
and
upon
our
body
are
imprinted
the
evidences
of
an
unyielding
cruelty
and
as
to
this
man
s
attainments
his
ignorance
understanding
and
belief
behold
what
the
book
which
embraceth
all
things
hath
revealed
verily
the
tree
of
zaqqúm
shall
be
the
food
of
the
and
then
follow
certain
verses
until
he
saith
taste
this
for
thou
forsooth
art
the
mighty
karím
consider
how
clearly
and
explicitly
he
hath
been
described
in
god
s
incorruptible
book
this
man
moreover
feigning
humility
hath
in
his
own
book
referred
to
himself
as
the
áthim
servant
áthím
in
the
book
of
god
mighty
among
the
common
herd
karím
in
name
ponder
the
blessed
verse
so
that
the
meaning
of
the
words
there
is
neither
a
thing
green
nor
sere
but
it
is
noted
in
the
unerring
book
may
be
imprinted
upon
the
tablet
of
thy
heart
notwithstanding
a
multitude
bear
him
allegiance
they
have
rejected
the
moses
of
knowledge
and
justice
and
clung
to
the
samírí
of
ignorance
they
have
turned
away
their
eyes
from
the
of
truth
which
shineth
in
the
divine
and
everlasting
heaven
and
have
utterly
ignored
its
splendour
o
my
brother
a
divine
mine
only
can
yield
the
gems
of
divine
knowledge
and
the
fragrance
of
the
mystic
flower
can
be
inhaled
only
in
the
ideal
garden
and
the
lilies
of
ancient
wisdom
can
blossom
nowhere
except
in
the
city
of
a
stainless
heart
in
a
rich
soil
its
plants
spring
forth
abundantly
by
permission
of
its
lord
and
in
that
soil
which
is
bad
they
spring
forth
but
inasmuch
as
it
hath
been
clearly
shown
that
only
those
who
are
initiated
into
the
divine
mysteries
can
comprehend
the
melodies
uttered
by
the
bird
of
heaven
it
is
therefore
incumbent
upon
every
one
to
seek
enlightenment
from
the
illumined
in
heart
and
from
the
treasuries
of
divine
mysteries
regarding
the
intricacies
of
god
s
faith
and
the
abstruse
allusions
in
the
utterances
of
the
of
holiness
thus
will
these
mysteries
be
unravelled
not
by
the
aid
of
acquired
learning
but
solely
through
the
assistance
of
god
and
the
outpourings
of
his
grace
ask
ye
therefore
of
them
that
have
the
custody
of
the
scriptures
if
ye
know
it
but
o
my
brother
when
a
true
seeker
determineth
to
take
the
step
of
search
in
the
path
leading
to
the
knowledge
of
the
ancient
of
days
he
must
before
all
else
cleanse
and
purify
his
heart
which
is
the
seat
of
the
revelation
of
the
inner
mysteries
of
god
from
the
obscuring
dust
of
all
acquired
knowledge
and
the
allusions
of
the
embodiments
of
satanic
fancy
he
must
purge
his
breast
which
is
the
sanctuary
of
the
abiding
love
of
the
beloved
of
every
defilement
and
sanctify
his
soul
from
all
that
pertaineth
to
water
and
clay
from
all
shadowy
and
ephemeral
attachments
he
must
so
cleanse
his
heart
that
no
remnant
of
either
love
or
hate
may
linger
therein
lest
that
love
blindly
incline
him
to
error
or
that
hate
repel
him
away
from
the
truth
even
as
thou
dost
witness
in
this
day
how
most
of
the
people
because
of
such
love
and
hate
are
bereft
of
the
immortal
face
have
strayed
far
from
the
embodiments
of
the
divine
mysteries
and
shepherdless
are
roaming
through
the
wilderness
of
oblivion
and
error
that
seeker
must
at
all
times
put
his
trust
in
god
must
renounce
the
peoples
of
the
earth
detach
himself
from
the
world
of
dust
and
cleave
unto
him
who
is
the
lord
of
lords
he
must
never
seek
to
exalt
himself
above
any
one
must
wash
away
from
the
tablet
of
his
heart
every
trace
of
pride
and
vainglory
must
cling
unto
patience
and
resignation
observe
silence
and
refrain
from
idle
talk
for
the
tongue
is
a
smouldering
fire
and
excess
of
speech
a
deadly
poison
material
fire
consumeth
the
body
whereas
the
fire
of
the
tongue
devoureth
both
heart
and
soul
the
force
of
the
former
lasteth
but
for
a
time
whilst
the
effects
of
the
latter
endure
a
century
that
seeker
should
also
regard
backbiting
as
grievous
error
and
keep
himself
aloof
from
its
dominion
inasmuch
as
backbiting
quencheth
the
light
of
the
heart
and
extinguisheth
the
life
of
the
soul
he
should
be
content
with
little
and
be
freed
from
all
inordinate
desire
he
should
treasure
the
companionship
of
those
that
have
renounced
the
world
and
regard
avoidance
of
boastful
and
worldly
people
a
precious
benefit
at
the
dawn
of
every
day
he
should
commune
with
god
and
with
all
his
soul
persevere
in
the
quest
of
his
beloved
he
should
consume
every
wayward
thought
with
the
flame
of
his
loving
mention
and
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
pass
by
all
else
save
him
he
should
succour
the
dispossessed
and
never
withhold
his
favour
from
the
destitute
he
should
show
kindness
to
animals
how
much
more
unto
his
to
him
who
is
endowed
with
the
power
of
utterance
he
should
not
hesitate
to
offer
up
his
life
for
his
beloved
nor
allow
the
censure
of
the
people
to
turn
him
away
from
the
truth
he
should
not
wish
for
others
that
which
he
doth
not
wish
for
himself
nor
promise
that
which
he
doth
not
fulfil
with
all
his
heart
should
the
seeker
avoid
fellowship
with
evil
doers
and
pray
for
the
remission
of
their
sins
he
should
forgive
the
sinful
and
never
despise
his
low
estate
for
none
knoweth
what
his
own
end
shall
be
how
often
hath
a
sinner
at
the
hour
of
death
attained
to
the
essence
of
faith
and
quaffing
the
immortal
draught
hath
taken
his
flight
unto
the
celestial
concourse
and
how
often
hath
a
devout
believer
at
the
hour
of
his
soul
s
ascension
been
so
changed
as
to
fall
into
the
nethermost
fire
our
purpose
in
revealing
these
convincing
and
weighty
utterances
is
to
impress
upon
the
seeker
that
he
should
regard
all
else
beside
god
as
transient
and
count
all
things
save
him
who
is
the
object
of
all
adoration
as
utter
nothingness
these
are
among
the
attributes
of
the
exalted
and
constitute
the
of
the
they
have
already
been
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
requirements
of
the
wayfarers
that
tread
the
path
of
positive
knowledge
when
the
detached
wayfarer
and
sincere
seeker
hath
fulfilled
these
essential
conditions
then
and
only
then
can
he
be
called
a
true
seeker
whensoever
he
hath
fulfilled
the
conditions
implied
in
the
verse
whoso
maketh
efforts
for
us
he
shall
enjoy
the
blessing
conferred
by
the
words
in
our
ways
shall
we
assuredly
guide
only
when
the
lamp
of
search
of
earnest
striving
of
longing
desire
of
passionate
devotion
of
fervid
love
of
rapture
and
ecstasy
is
kindled
within
the
seeker
s
heart
and
the
breeze
of
his
is
wafted
upon
his
soul
will
the
darkness
of
error
be
dispelled
the
mists
of
doubts
and
misgivings
be
dissipated
and
the
lights
of
knowledge
and
certitude
envelop
his
being
at
that
hour
will
the
mystic
herald
bearing
the
joyful
tidings
of
the
spirit
shine
forth
from
the
city
of
god
resplendent
as
the
morn
and
through
the
of
knowledge
will
awaken
the
heart
the
soul
and
the
spirit
from
the
slumber
of
negligence
then
will
the
manifold
favours
and
outpouring
grace
of
the
holy
and
everlasting
spirit
confer
such
new
life
upon
the
seeker
that
he
will
find
himself
endowed
with
a
new
eye
a
new
ear
a
new
heart
and
a
new
mind
he
will
contemplate
the
manifest
signs
of
the
universe
and
will
penetrate
the
hidden
mysteries
of
the
soul
gazing
with
the
eye
of
god
he
will
perceive
within
every
atom
a
door
that
leadeth
him
to
the
stations
of
absolute
certitude
he
will
discover
in
all
things
the
mysteries
of
divine
revelation
and
the
evidences
of
an
everlasting
manifestation
i
swear
by
god
were
he
that
treadeth
the
path
of
guidance
and
seeketh
to
scale
the
heights
of
righteousness
to
attain
unto
this
glorious
and
supreme
station
he
would
inhale
at
a
distance
of
a
thousand
leagues
the
fragrance
of
god
and
would
perceive
the
resplendent
morn
of
a
divine
guidance
rising
above
the
dayspring
of
all
things
each
and
every
thing
however
small
would
be
to
him
a
revelation
leading
him
to
his
beloved
the
object
of
his
quest
so
great
shall
be
the
discernment
of
this
seeker
that
he
will
discriminate
between
truth
and
falsehood
even
as
he
doth
distinguish
the
sun
from
shadow
if
in
the
uttermost
corners
of
the
east
the
sweet
savours
of
god
be
wafted
he
will
assuredly
recognize
and
inhale
their
fragrance
even
though
he
be
dwelling
in
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
west
he
will
likewise
clearly
distinguish
all
the
signs
of
wondrous
utterances
his
great
works
and
mighty
the
doings
words
and
ways
of
men
even
as
the
jeweller
who
knoweth
the
gem
from
the
stone
or
the
man
who
distinguisheth
the
spring
from
autumn
and
heat
from
cold
when
the
channel
of
the
human
soul
is
cleansed
of
all
worldly
and
impeding
attachments
it
will
unfailingly
perceive
the
breath
of
the
beloved
across
immeasurable
distances
and
will
led
by
its
perfume
attain
and
enter
the
city
of
certitude
therein
he
will
discern
the
wonders
of
his
ancient
wisdom
and
will
perceive
all
the
hidden
teachings
from
the
rustling
leaves
of
the
flourisheth
in
that
city
with
both
his
inner
and
his
outer
ear
he
will
hear
from
its
dust
the
hymns
of
glory
and
praise
ascending
unto
the
lord
of
lords
and
with
his
inner
eye
will
he
discover
the
mysteries
of
return
and
how
unspeakably
glorious
are
the
signs
the
tokens
the
revelations
and
splendours
which
he
who
is
the
king
of
names
and
attributes
hath
destined
for
that
city
the
attainment
of
this
city
quencheth
thirst
without
water
and
kindleth
the
love
of
god
without
fire
within
every
blade
of
grass
are
enshrined
the
mysteries
of
an
inscrutable
wisdom
and
upon
every
a
myriad
nightingales
pour
out
in
blissful
rapture
their
melody
its
wondrous
tulips
unfold
the
mystery
of
the
undying
fire
in
the
burning
bush
and
its
sweet
savours
of
holiness
breathe
the
perfume
of
the
messianic
spirit
it
bestoweth
wealth
without
gold
and
conferreth
immortality
without
death
in
every
leaf
ineffable
delights
are
treasured
and
within
every
chamber
unnumbered
mysteries
lie
hidden
they
that
valiantly
labour
in
quest
of
god
s
will
when
once
they
have
renounced
all
else
but
him
will
be
so
attached
and
wedded
to
that
city
that
a
moment
s
separation
from
it
would
to
them
be
unthinkable
they
will
hearken
unto
infallible
proofs
from
the
hyacinth
of
that
assembly
and
receive
the
surest
testimonies
from
the
beauty
of
its
rose
and
the
melody
of
its
nightingale
once
in
about
a
thousand
years
shall
this
city
be
renewed
and
wherefore
o
my
friend
it
behooveth
us
to
exert
the
highest
endeavour
to
attain
unto
that
city
and
by
the
grace
of
god
and
his
rend
asunder
the
veils
of
glory
so
that
with
inflexible
steadfastness
we
may
sacrifice
our
drooping
souls
in
the
path
of
the
new
beloved
we
should
with
tearful
eyes
fervently
and
repeatedly
implore
him
to
grant
us
the
favour
of
that
grace
that
city
is
none
other
than
the
word
of
god
revealed
in
every
age
and
dispensation
in
the
days
of
moses
it
was
the
pentateuch
in
the
days
of
jesus
the
gospel
in
the
days
of
muḥammad
the
messenger
of
god
the
qur
án
in
this
day
the
bayán
and
in
the
dispensation
of
him
whom
god
will
make
manifest
his
own
book
unto
which
all
the
books
of
former
dispensations
must
needs
be
referred
the
book
which
standeth
amongst
them
all
transcendent
and
supreme
in
these
cities
spiritual
sustenance
is
bountifully
provided
and
incorruptible
delights
have
been
ordained
the
food
they
bestow
is
the
bread
of
heaven
and
the
spirit
they
impart
is
god
s
imperishable
blessing
upon
detached
souls
they
bestow
the
gift
of
unity
enrich
the
destitute
and
offer
the
cup
of
knowledge
unto
them
who
wander
in
the
wilderness
of
ignorance
all
the
guidance
the
blessings
the
learning
the
understanding
the
faith
and
certitude
conferred
upon
all
that
is
in
heaven
and
on
earth
are
hidden
and
treasured
within
these
cities
for
instance
the
qur
án
was
an
impregnable
stronghold
unto
the
people
of
muḥammad
in
his
days
whosoever
entered
therein
was
shielded
from
the
devilish
assaults
the
menacing
darts
the
doubts
and
blasphemous
whisperings
of
the
enemy
upon
him
was
also
bestowed
a
portion
of
the
everlasting
and
goodly
fruits
of
wisdom
from
the
divine
tree
to
him
was
given
to
drink
the
incorruptible
waters
of
the
river
of
knowledge
and
to
taste
the
wine
of
the
mysteries
of
divine
unity
all
the
things
that
people
required
in
connection
with
the
revelation
of
muḥammad
and
his
laws
were
to
be
found
revealed
and
manifest
in
that
ridván
of
resplendent
glory
that
book
constitutes
an
abiding
testimony
to
its
people
after
muḥammad
inasmuch
as
its
decrees
are
indisputable
and
its
promise
unfailing
all
have
been
enjoined
to
follow
the
precepts
of
that
book
until
the
year
sixty
year
of
the
advent
of
god
s
wondrous
manifestation
that
book
is
the
book
which
unfailingly
leadeth
the
seeker
unto
the
ridván
of
the
divine
presence
and
causeth
him
that
hath
forsaken
his
country
and
is
treading
the
seeker
s
path
to
enter
the
tabernacle
of
everlasting
reunion
its
guidance
can
never
err
its
testimony
no
other
testimony
can
excel
all
other
traditions
all
other
books
and
records
are
bereft
of
such
distinction
inasmuch
as
both
the
traditions
and
they
that
have
spoken
them
are
confirmed
and
proven
solely
by
the
text
of
that
book
moreover
the
traditions
themselves
grievously
differ
and
their
obscurities
are
manifold
muḥammad
himself
as
the
end
of
his
mission
drew
nigh
spoke
these
words
verily
i
leave
amongst
you
my
twin
weighty
testimonies
the
book
of
god
and
my
although
many
traditions
had
been
revealed
by
that
source
of
prophethood
and
mine
of
divine
guidance
yet
he
mentioned
only
that
book
thereby
appointing
it
as
the
mightiest
instrument
and
surest
testimony
for
the
seekers
a
guide
for
the
people
until
the
day
of
resurrection
with
unswerving
vision
with
pure
heart
and
sanctified
spirit
consider
attentively
what
god
hath
established
as
the
testimony
of
guidance
for
his
people
in
his
book
which
is
recognized
as
authentic
by
both
the
high
and
lowly
to
this
testimony
we
both
as
well
as
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
must
cling
that
through
its
light
we
may
know
and
distinguish
between
truth
and
falsehood
guidance
and
error
inasmuch
as
muḥammad
hath
confined
his
testimonies
to
his
book
and
to
his
family
and
whereas
the
latter
hath
passed
away
there
remaineth
his
book
only
as
his
one
testimony
amongst
the
people
in
the
beginning
of
his
book
he
saith
alif
lám
mím
no
doubt
is
there
about
this
book
it
is
a
guidance
unto
the
in
the
disconnected
letters
of
the
qur
án
the
mysteries
of
the
divine
essence
are
enshrined
and
within
their
shells
the
pearls
of
his
unity
are
treasured
for
lack
of
space
we
do
not
dwell
upon
them
at
this
moment
outwardly
they
signify
muḥammad
himself
whom
god
addresseth
saying
o
muḥammad
there
is
no
doubt
nor
uncertainty
about
this
book
which
hath
been
sent
down
from
the
heaven
of
divine
unity
in
it
is
guidance
unto
them
that
fear
consider
how
he
hath
appointed
and
decreed
this
book
the
qur
án
as
a
guidance
unto
all
that
are
in
heaven
and
on
earth
he
the
divine
being
and
unknowable
essence
hath
himself
testified
that
this
book
is
beyond
all
doubt
and
uncertainty
the
guide
of
all
mankind
until
the
day
of
resurrection
and
now
we
ask
is
it
fair
for
this
people
to
view
with
doubt
and
misgiving
this
most
weighty
testimony
the
divine
origin
of
which
god
hath
proclaimed
and
pronounced
it
to
be
the
embodiment
of
truth
is
it
fair
for
them
to
turn
away
from
the
thing
which
he
hath
appointed
as
the
supreme
instrument
of
guidance
for
attainment
unto
the
loftiest
summits
of
knowledge
and
to
seek
aught
else
but
that
book
how
can
they
allow
men
s
absurd
and
foolish
sayings
to
sow
the
seeds
of
distrust
in
their
minds
how
can
they
any
longer
idly
contend
that
a
certain
person
hath
spoken
this
or
that
way
or
that
a
certain
thing
did
not
come
to
pass
had
there
been
anything
conceivable
besides
the
book
of
god
which
could
prove
a
more
potent
instrument
and
a
surer
guide
to
mankind
would
he
have
failed
to
reveal
it
in
that
verse
it
is
incumbent
upon
us
not
to
depart
from
god
s
irresistible
injunction
and
fixed
decree
as
revealed
in
the
verse
we
should
acknowledge
the
holy
and
wondrous
scriptures
for
failing
to
do
this
we
have
failed
to
acknowledge
the
truth
of
this
blessed
verse
for
it
is
evident
that
whoso
hath
failed
to
acknowledge
the
truth
of
the
qur
án
hath
in
reality
failed
to
acknowledge
the
truth
of
the
preceding
scriptures
this
is
but
the
manifest
implication
of
the
verse
were
we
to
expound
its
inner
meanings
and
unfold
its
hidden
mysteries
eternity
would
never
suffice
to
exhaust
their
import
nor
would
the
universe
be
capable
of
hearing
them
god
verily
testifieth
to
the
truth
of
our
saying
in
another
passage
he
likewise
saith
and
if
ye
be
in
doubt
as
to
that
which
we
have
sent
down
to
our
servant
then
produce
a
súrah
like
it
and
summon
your
witnesses
beside
god
if
ye
are
men
of
behold
how
lofty
is
the
station
and
how
consummate
the
virtue
of
these
verses
which
he
hath
declared
to
be
his
surest
testimony
his
infallible
proof
the
evidence
of
his
power
and
a
revelation
of
the
potency
of
his
will
he
the
divine
king
hath
proclaimed
the
undisputed
supremacy
of
the
verses
of
his
book
over
all
things
that
testify
to
his
truth
for
compared
with
all
other
proofs
and
tokens
the
verses
shine
as
the
sun
whilst
all
others
are
as
stars
to
the
peoples
of
the
world
they
are
the
abiding
testimony
the
incontrovertible
proof
the
shining
light
of
the
ideal
king
their
excellence
is
unrivalled
their
virtue
nothing
can
surpass
they
are
the
treasury
of
the
divine
pearls
and
the
depository
of
the
divine
mysteries
they
constitute
the
indissoluble
bond
the
firm
cord
the
urvatu
the
inextinguishable
light
through
them
floweth
the
river
of
divine
knowledge
and
gloweth
the
fire
of
his
ancient
and
consummate
wisdom
this
is
the
fire
which
in
one
and
the
same
moment
kindleth
the
flame
of
love
in
the
breasts
of
the
faithful
and
induceth
the
chill
of
heedlessness
in
the
heart
of
the
enemy
o
friend
it
behooveth
us
not
to
waive
the
injunction
of
god
but
rather
acquiesce
and
submit
to
that
which
he
hath
ordained
as
his
divine
testimony
this
verse
is
too
weighty
and
pregnant
an
utterance
for
this
afflicted
soul
to
demonstrate
and
expound
god
speaketh
the
truth
and
leadeth
the
way
he
verily
is
supreme
over
all
his
people
he
is
the
mighty
the
beneficent
likewise
he
saith
such
are
the
verses
of
god
with
truth
do
we
recite
them
to
thee
but
in
what
revelation
will
they
believe
if
they
reject
god
and
his
verses
if
thou
wilt
grasp
the
implication
of
this
verse
thou
wilt
recognize
the
truth
that
no
manifestation
greater
than
the
prophets
of
god
hath
ever
been
revealed
and
no
testimony
mightier
than
the
testimony
of
their
revealed
verses
hath
ever
appeared
upon
the
earth
nay
this
testimony
no
other
testimony
can
ever
excel
except
that
which
the
lord
thy
god
willeth
in
another
passage
he
saith
woe
to
every
lying
sinner
who
heareth
the
verses
of
god
recited
to
him
and
then
as
though
he
heard
them
not
persisteth
in
proud
disdain
apprise
him
of
a
painful
the
implications
of
this
verse
alone
suffice
all
that
is
in
heaven
and
on
earth
were
the
people
to
ponder
the
verses
of
their
lord
for
thou
hearest
how
in
this
day
the
people
disdainfully
ignore
the
verses
as
though
they
were
the
meanest
of
all
things
and
yet
nothing
greater
than
these
verses

will
ever

in
the

say
unto
them
o
heedless
people
ye
repeat
what
your
fathers
in
a
bygone
age
have
said
whatever
fruits
they
have
gathered
from
the
tree
of
their
faithlessness
the
same
shall
ye
gather
also
ere
long
shall
ye
be
gathered
unto
your
fathers
and
with
them
shall
ye
dwell
in
hellish
fire
an
ill
abode
the
abode
of
the
people
of
in
yet
another
passage
he
saith
and
when
he
becometh
acquainted
with
any
of
our
verses
he
turneth
them
to
ridicule
there
is
a
shameful
punishment
for
them
the
people
derisively
observed
saying
work
thou
another
miracle
and
give
us
another
sign
one
would
say
make
now
a
part
of
the
heaven
to
fall
down
upon
us
and
another
if
this
be
the
very
truth
from
before
thee
rain
down
stones
upon
us
from
even
as
the
people
of
israel
in
the
time
of
moses
bartered
away
the
bread
of
heaven
for
the
sordid
things
of
the
earth
these
people
likewise
sought
to
exchange
the
verses
for
their
foul
their
vile
and
idle
desires
in
like
manner
thou
beholdest
in
this
day
that
although
spiritual
sustenance
hath
descended
from
the
heaven
of
divine
mercy
and
been
showered
from
the
clouds
of
his
loving
kindness
and
although
the
seas
of
life
at
the
behest
of
the
lord
of
all
being
are
surging
within
the
ridván
of
the
heart
yet
these
people
ravenous
as
the
dogs
have
gathered
around
carrion
and
contented
themselves
with
the
stagnant
waters
of
a
briny
lake
gracious
god
how
strange
the
way
of
this
people
they
clamour
for
guidance
although
the
standards
of
him
who
guideth
all
things
are
already
hoisted
they
cleave
to
the
obscure
intricacies
of
knowledge
when
he
who
is
the
object
of
all
knowledge
shineth
as
the
sun
they
see
the
sun
with
their
own
eyes
and
yet
question
that
brilliant
orb
as
to
the
proof
of
its
light
they
behold
the
vernal
showers
descending
upon
them
and
yet
seek
an
evidence
of
that
bounty
the
proof
of
the
sun
is
the
light
thereof
which
shineth
and
envelopeth
all
things
the
evidence
of
the
shower
is
the
bounty
thereof
which
reneweth
and
investeth
the
world
with
the
mantle
of
life
yea
the
blind
can
perceive
naught
from
the
sun
except
its
heat
and
the
arid
soil
hath
no
share
of
the
showers
of
mercy
marvel
not
if
in
the
qur
án
the
unbeliever
perceiveth
naught
but
the
trace
of
letters
for
in
the
sun
the
blind
findeth
naught
but
in
another
passage
he
saith
and
when
our
clear
verses
are
recited
to
them
their
only
argument
is
to
say
bring
back
our
fathers
if
ye
speak
the
truth
behold
what
foolish
evidences
they
sought
from
these
embodiments
of
an
mercy
they
scoffed
at
the
verses
a
single
letter
of
which
is
greater
than
the
creation
of
heavens
and
earth
and
which
quickeneth
the
dead
of
the
valley
of
self
and
desire
with
the
spirit
of
faith
and
clamoured
saying
cause
our
fathers
to
speed
out
of
their
such
was
the
perversity
and
pride
of
that
people
each
one
of
these
verses
is
unto
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
an
unfailing
testimony
and
a
glorious
proof
of
his
truth
each
of
them
verily
sufficeth
all
mankind
wert
thou
to
meditate
upon
the
verses
of
god
in
the
verse
itself
pearls
of
mysteries
lie
hidden
whatever
be
the
ailment
the
remedy
it
offereth
can
never
fail
heed
not
the
idle
contention
of
those
who
maintain
that
the
book
and
verses
thereof
can
never
be
a
testimony
unto
the
common
people
inasmuch
as
they
neither
grasp
their
meaning
nor
appreciate
their
value
and
yet
the
unfailing
testimony
of
god
to
both
the
east
and
the
west
is
none
other
than
the
qur
án
were
it
beyond
the
comprehension
of
men
how
could
it
have
been
declared
as
a
universal
testimony
unto
all
people
if
their
contention
be
true
none
would
therefore
be
required
nor
would
it
be
necessary
for
them
to
know
god
inasmuch
as
the
knowledge
of
the
divine
being
transcendeth
the
knowledge
of
his
book
and
the
common
people
would
not
possess
the
capacity
to
comprehend
it
such
contention
is
utterly
fallacious
and
inadmissible
it
is
actuated
solely
by
arrogance
and
pride
its
motive
is
to
lead
the
people
astray
from
the
ridván
of
divine
and
to
tighten
the
reins
of
their
authority
over
the
people
and
yet
in
the
sight
of
god
these
common
people
are
infinitely
superior
and
exalted
above
their
religious
leaders
who
have
turned
away
from
the
one
true
god
the
understanding
of
his
words
and
the
comprehension
of
the
utterances
of
the
birds
of
heaven
are
in
no
wise
dependent
upon
human
learning
they
depend
solely
upon
purity
of
heart
chastity
of
soul
and
freedom
of
spirit
this
is
evidenced
by
those
who
today
though
without
a
single
letter
of
the
accepted
standards
of
learning
are
occupying
the
loftiest
seats
of
knowledge
and
the
garden
of
their
hearts
is
adorned
through
the
showers
of
divine
grace
with
the
roses
of
wisdom
and
the
tulips
of
understanding
well
is
it
with
the
sincere
in
heart
for
their
share
of
the
light
of
a
mighty
day
and
likewise
he
saith
as
for
those
who
believe
not
in
the
verses
of
god
or
that
they
shall
ever
meet
him
these
of
my
mercy
shall
despair
and
these
doth
a
grievous
chastisement
also
and
they
say
shall
we
then
abandon
our
gods
for
a
crazed
poet
the
implication
of
this
verse
is
manifest
behold
what
they
observed
after
the
verses
were
revealed
they
called
him
a
poet
scoffed
at
the
verses
of
god
and
exclaimed
saying
these
words
of
his
are
but
tales
of
the
ancients
by
this
they
meant
that
those
words
which
were
spoken
by
the
peoples
of
old
muḥammad
hath
compiled
and
called
them
the
word
of
god
likewise
in
this
day
thou
hast
heard
the
people
impute
similar
charges
to
this
revelation
saying
he
hath
compiled
these
words
from
the
words
of
old
or
these
words
are
vain
and
haughty
are
their
sayings
low
their
estate
and
station
after
the
denials
and
denunciations
which
they
uttered
and
unto
which
we
have
referred
they
protested
saying
no
independent
prophet
according
to
our
scriptures
should
arise
after
moses
and
jesus
to
abolish
the
law
of
divine
revelation
nay
he
that
is
to
be
made
manifest
must
needs
fulfil
the
thereupon
this
verse
indicative
of
all
the
divine
themes
and
testifying
to
the
truth
that
the
flow
of
the
grace
of
the
can
never
cease
was
revealed
and
joseph
came
to
you
aforetime
with
clear
tokens
but
ye
ceased
not
to
doubt
of
the
message
with
which
he
came
to
you
until
when
he
died
ye
said
god
will
by
no
means
raise
up
a
messenger
after
thus
god
misleadeth
him
who
is
the
transgressor
the
therefore
understand
from
this
verse
and
know
of
a
certainty
that
the
people
in
every
age
clinging
to
a
verse
of
the
book
have
uttered
such
vain
and
absurd
sayings
contending
that
no
prophet
should
again
be
made
manifest
to
the
world
even
as
the
christian
divines
who
holding
fast
to
the
verse
of
the
gospel
to
which
we
have
already
referred
have
sought
to
explain
that
the
law
of
the
gospel
shall
at
no
time
be
annulled
and
that
no
independent
prophet
shall
again
be
made
manifest
unless
he
confirmeth
the
law
of
the
gospel
most
of
the
people
have
become
afflicted
with
the
same
spiritual
disease
even
as
thou
dost
witness
how
the
people
of
the
qur
án
like
unto
the
people
of
old
have
allowed
the
words
seal
of
the
prophets
to
veil
their
eyes
and
yet
they
themselves
testify
to
this
verse
none
knoweth
the
interpretation
thereof
but
god
and
they
that
are
in
and
when
he
who
is
in
all
knowledge
he
who
is
the
mother
the
soul
the
secret
and
the
essence
thereof
revealeth
that
which
is
the
least
contrary
to
their
desire
they
bitterly
oppose
him
and
shamelessly
deny
him
these
thou
hast
already
heard
and
witnessed
such
deeds
and
words
have
been
solely
instigated
by
leaders
of
religion
they
that
worship
no
god
but
their
own
desire
who
bear
allegiance
to
naught
but
gold
who
are
wrapt
in
the
densest
veils
of
learning
and
who
enmeshed
by
its
obscurities
are
lost
in
the
wilds
of
error
even
as
the
lord
of
being
hath
explicitly
declared
what
thinkest
thou
he
who
hath
made
a
god
of
his
passions
and
whom
god
causeth
to
err
through
a
knowledge
and
whose
ears
and
whose
heart
he
hath
sealed
up
and
over
whose
sight
he
hath
cast
a
after
his
rejection
by
god
shall
guide
such
a
one
will
ye
not
then
be
warned
although
the
outward
meaning
of
whom
god
causeth
to
err
through
a
knowledge
is
what
hath
been
revealed
yet
to
us
it
signifieth
those
divines
of
the
age
who
have
turned
away
from
the
beauty
of
god
and
who
clinging
unto
their
own
learning
as
fashioned
by
their
own
fancies
and
desires
have
denounced
god
s
divine
message
and
revelation
say
it
is
a
weighty
message
from
which
ye
turn
aside
likewise
he
saith
and
when
our
clear
verses
are
recited
to
them
they
say
this
is
merely
a
man
who
would
fain
pervert
you
from
your
father
s
and
they
say
this
is
none
other
than
a
forged
give
ear
unto
god
s
holy
voice
and
heed
thou
his
sweet
and
immortal
melody
behold
how
he
hath
solemnly
warned
them
that
have
repudiated
the
verses
of
god
and
hath
disowned
them
that
have
denied
his
holy
words
consider
how
far
the
people
have
strayed
from
the
kawthar
of
the
divine
presence
and
how
grievous
hath
been
the
faithlessness
and
arrogance
of
the
spiritually
destitute
in
the
face
of
that
sanctified
beauty
although
that
essence
of
lovingkindness
and
bounty
caused
those
evanescent
beings
to
step
into
the
realm
of
immortality
and
guided
those
destitute
souls
to
the
sacred
river
of
wealth
yet
some
denounced
him
as
a
calumniator
of
god
the
lord
of
all
creatures
others
accused
him
of
being
the
one
that
withholdeth
the
people
from
the
path
of
faith
and
true
belief
and
still
others
declared
him
to
be
a
lunatic
and
the
like
in
like
manner
thou
observest
in
this
day
with
what
vile
imputations
they
have
assailed
that
gem
of
immortality
and
what
unspeakable
transgressions
they
have
heaped
upon
him
who
is
the
source
of
purity
although
god
hath
throughout
his
book
and
in
his
holy
and
immortal
tablet
warned
them
that
deny
and
repudiate
the
revealed
verses
and
hath
announced
his
grace
unto
them
that
accept
them
yet
behold
the
unnumbered
cavils
they
raised
against
those
verses
which
have
been
sent
down
from
the
new
heaven
of
god
s
eternal
holiness
this
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
no
eye
hath
beheld
so
great
an
outpouring
of
bounty
nor
hath
any
ear
heard
of
such
a
revelation
of
lovingkindness
such
bounty
and
revelation
have
been
made
manifest
that
the
revealed
verses
seemed
as
vernal
showers
raining
from
the
clouds
of
the
mercy
of
the
the
prophets
endowed
with
constancy
whose
loftiness
and
glory
shine
as
the
sun
were
each
honoured
with
a
book
which
all
have
seen
and
the
verses
of
which
have
been
duly
ascertained
whereas
the
verses
which
have
rained
from
this
cloud
of
divine
mercy
have
been
so
abundant
that
none
hath
yet
been
able
to
estimate
their
number
a
score
of
volumes
are
now
available
how
many
still
remain
beyond
our
reach
how
many
have
been
plundered
and
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
the
fate
of
which
none
knoweth
o
brother
we
should
open
our
eyes
meditate
upon
his
word
and
seek
the
sheltering
shadow
of
the
manifestations
of
god
that
perchance
we
may
be
warned
by
the
unmistakable
counsels
of
the
book
and
give
heed
to
the
admonitions
recorded
in
the
holy
tablets
that
we
may
not
cavil
at
the
revealer
of
the
verses
that
we
may
resign
ourselves
wholly
to
his
cause
and
embrace
wholeheartedly
his
law
that
haply
we
may
enter
the
court
of
his
mercy
and
dwell
upon
the
shore
of
his
grace
he
verily
is
merciful
and
forgiving
towards
his
servants
and
likewise
he
saith
say
o
people
of
the
book
do
ye
not
disavow
us
only
because
we
believe
in
god
and
in
what
he
hath
sent
down
to
us
and
in
what
he
hath
sent
down
aforetime
and
because
most
of
you
are
doers
of
ill
how
explicitly
doth
this
verse
reveal
our
purpose
and
how
clearly
doth
it
demonstrate
the
truth
of
the
testimony
of
the
verses
of
god
this
verse
was
revealed
at
a
time
when
islám
was
assailed
by
the
infidels
and
its
followers
were
accused
of
misbelief
when
the
companions
of
muḥammad
were
denounced
as
repudiators
of
god
and
as
followers
of
a
lying
sorcerer
in
its
early
days
when
islám
was
still
to
outward
seeming
devoid
of
authority
and
power
the
friends
of
the
prophet
who
had
turned
their
face
toward
god
wherever
they
went
were
harassed
persecuted
stoned
and
vilified
at
such
a
time
this
blessed
verse
was
sent
down
from
the
heaven
of
divine
revelation
it
revealed
an
irrefutable
evidence
and
brought
the
light
of
an
unfailing
guidance
it
instructed
the
companions
of
muḥammad
to
declare
the
following
unto
the
infidels
and
idolators
ye
oppress
and
persecute
us
and
yet
what
else
have
we
done
except
that
we
have
believed
in
god
and
in
the
verses
sent
down
unto
us
through
the
tongue
of
muḥammad
and
in
those
which
descended
upon
the
prophets
of
old
by
this
is
meant
that
their
only
guilt
was
to
have
recognized
that
the
new
and
wondrous
verses
of
god
which
had
descended
upon
muḥammad
as
well
as
those
which
had
been
revealed
unto
the
prophets
of
old
were
all
of
god
and
to
have
acknowledged
and
embraced
their
truth
this
is
the
testimony
which
the
divine
king
hath
taught
his
servants
in
view
of
this
is
it
fair
for
this
people
to
repudiate
these
verses
which
have
encompassed
both
the
east
and
the
west
and
to
regard
themselves
as
the
upholders
of
true
belief
should
they
not
rather
believe
in
him
who
hath
revealed
these
verses
considering
the
testimony
which
he
himself
hath
established
how
could
he
fail
to
account
as
true
believers
them
that
have
testified
to
its
truth
far
be
it
from
him
that
he
should
turn
away
from
the
gates
of
his
mercy
them
that
have
turned
unto
and
embraced
the
truth
of
the
divine
verses
or
that
he
should
threaten
those
that
have
clung
to
his
sure
testimony
he
verily
establisheth
the
truth
through
his
verses
and
confirmeth
his
revelation
by
his
words
he
verily
is
the
powerful
the
help
in
peril
the
almighty
and
likewise
he
saith
and
had
we
sent
down
unto
thee
a
book
written
on
parchment
and
they
had
touched
it
with
their
hands
the
infidels
would
surely
have
said
this
is
naught
but
palpable
most
of
the
verses
of
the
qur
án
are
indicative
of
this
theme
we
have
for
the
sake
of
brevity
mentioned
only
these
verses
consider
hath
anything
else
besides
the
verses
been
established
in
the
whole
book
as
a
standard
for
the
recognition
of
the
manifestations
of
his
beauty
that
the
people
might
cling
to
and
reject
the
manifestations
of
god
on
the
contrary
in
every
instance
he
hath
threatened
with
fire
those
that
repudiate
and
scoff
at
the
verses
as
already
shown
therefore
should
a
person
arise
and
bring
forth
a
myriad
verses
discourses
epistles
and
prayers
none
of
which
have
been
acquired
through
learning
what
conceivable
excuse
could
justify
those
that
reject
them
and
deprive
themselves
of
the
potency
of
their
grace
what
answer
could
they
give
when
once
their
soul
hath
ascended
and
departed
from
its
gloomy
temple
could
they
seek
to
justify
themselves
by
saying
we
have
clung
to
a
certain
tradition
and
not
having
beheld
the
literal
fulfilment
thereof
we
have
therefore
raised
such
cavils
against
the
embodiments
of
divine
revelation
and
kept
remote
from
the
law
of
god
hast
thou
not
heard
that
among
the
reasons
why
certain
prophets
have
been
designated
as
prophets
endowed
with
constancy
was
the
revelation
of
a
book
unto
them
and
yet
how
could
this
people
be
justified
in
rejecting
the
revealer
and
author
of
so
many
volumes
of
verses
and
follow
the
sayings
of
him
who
hath
foolishly
sown
the
seeds
of
doubt
in
the
hearts
of
men
and
who
hath
risen
to
lead
the
people
into
the
paths
of
perdition
and
error
how
could
they
allow
such
things
to
deprive
them
of
the
light
of
the
sun
of
divine
bounty
aside
from
these
things
if
these
people
shun
and
reject
such
a
divine
soul
such
holy
breath
to
whom
we
wonder
could
they
cling
to
whose
face
besides
his
face
could
they
turn
all
have
a
quarter
of
the
heavens
to
which
they
we
have
shown
thee
these
two
ways
walk
thou
the
way
thou
choosest
this
verily
is
the
truth
and
after
truth
there
remaineth
naught
but
error
amongst
the
proofs
demonstrating
the
truth
of
this
revelation
is
this
that
in
every
age
and
dispensation
whenever
the
invisible
essence
was
revealed
in
the
person
of
his
manifestation
certain
souls
obscure
and
detached
from
all
worldly
entanglements
would
seek
illumination
from
the
sun
of
prophethood
and
moon
of
divine
guidance
and
would
attain
unto
the
divine
presence
for
this
reason
the
divines
of
the
age
and
those
possessed
of
wealth
would
scorn
and
scoff
at
these
people
even
as
he
hath
revealed
concerning
them
that
erred
then
said
the
chiefs
of
his
people
who
believed
not
we
see
in
thee
but
a
man
like
ourselves
and
we
see
not
any
who
have
followed
thee
except
our
meanest
ones
of
hasty
judgment
nor
see
we
any
excellence
in
you
above
ourselves
nay
we
deem
you
they
caviled
at
those
holy
manifestations
and
protested
saying
none
hath
followed
you
except
the
abject
amongst
us
those
who
are
worthy
of
no
their
aim
was
to
show
that
no
one
amongst
the
learned
the
wealthy
and
the
renowned
believed
in
them
by
this
and
similar
proofs
they
sought
to
demonstrate
the
falsity
of
him
that
speaketh
naught
but
the
truth
in
this
most
resplendent
dispensation
however
this
most
mighty
sovereignty
a
number
of
illumined
divines
of
men
of
consummate
learning
of
doctors
of
mature
wisdom
have
attained
unto
his
court
drunk
the
cup
of
his
divine
presence
and
been
invested
with
the
honour
of
his
most
excellent
favour
they
have
renounced
for
the
sake
of
the
beloved
the
world
and
all
that
is
therein
we
will
mention
the
names
of
some
of
them

it

not

these
were
guided
by
the
light
of
that
sun
of
divine
revelation
confessed
and
acknowledged
his
truth
such
was
their
faith
that
most
of

renounced
their

to
the
of
the
they
laid
down
their
lives
for

and
surrendered

infidel
no

it
not

witness
against
the
faithlessness
of

who
for
a
trifle
betrayed
their
faith
who
bartered
away
immortality
for
that
which
perisheth
who
gave

springs

whose
one
aim
in
life
is
to
usurp
the
property
of
others
even
as
thou
dost
witness
how
all
of
them
have
busied
themselves
with
the
vanities
of
the
world
and
have
strayed
far
from
him
who
is
the
lord
the
most
high
be
fair
is
the
testimony
of
those
acceptable
and
worthy
of
attention
whose
deeds
agree
with
their
words
whose
outward
behaviour
conforms
with
their
inner
life
the
mind
is
bewildered
at
their
deeds
and
the
soul
marvelleth
at
their
fortitude
and
bodily
endurance
or
is
the
testimony
of
these
faithless
souls
who
breathe
naught
but
the
breath
of
selfish
desire
and
who
lie
imprisoned
in
the
cage
of
their
idle
fancies
acceptable
like
the
bats
of
darkness
they
lift
not
their
heads
from
their
couch
except
to
pursue
the
transient
things
of
the
world
and
find
no
rest
by
night
except
as
they
labour
to
advance
the
aims
of
their
sordid
life
immersed
in
their
selfish
schemes
they
are
oblivious
of
the
divine
decree
in
the
they
strive
with
all
their
soul
after
worldly
benefits
and
in
the
their
sole
occupation
is
to
gratify
their
carnal
desires
by
what
law
or
standard
could
men
be
justified
in
cleaving
to
the
denials
of
such
souls
and
in
ignoring
the
faith
of
them
that
have
renounced
for
the
sake
of
the
of
god
their
life
and
substance
their
fame
and
renown
their
reputation
and
honour
were
not
the
happenings
of
the
life
of
the
prince
of
martyrs
regarded
as
the
greatest
of
all
events
as
the
supreme
evidence
of
his
truth
did
not
the
people
of
old
declare
those
happenings
to
be
unprecedented
did
they
not
maintain
that
no
manifestation
of
truth
hath
ever
evinced
such
constancy
such
conspicuous
glory
and
yet
that
episode
of
his
life
commencing
as
it
did
in
the
morning
was
brought
to
a
close
by
the
middle
of
the
same
day
whereas
these
holy
lights
have
for
eighteen
years
heroically
endured
the
showers
of
afflictions
which
from
every
side
have
rained
upon
them
with
what
love
what
devotion
what
exultation
and
holy
rapture
they
sacrificed
their
lives
in
the
path
of
the
to
the
truth
of
this
all
witness
and
yet
how
can
they
belittle
this
revelation
hath
any
age
witnessed
such
momentous
happenings
if
these
companions
be
not
the
true
strivers
after
god
who
else
could
be
called
by
this
name
have
these
companions
been
seekers
after
power
or
glory
have
they
ever
yearned
for
riches
have
they
cherished
any
desire
except
the
of
god
if
these
companions
with
all
their
marvellous
testimonies
and
wondrous
works
be
false
who
then
is
worthy
to
claim
for
himself
the
truth
i
swear
by
god
their
very
deeds
are
a
sufficient
testimony
and
an
irrefutable
proof
unto
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
were
men
to
ponder
in
their
hearts
the
mysteries
of
divine
revelation
and
they
who
act
unjustly
shall
soon
know
what
lot
awaiteth
them
furthermore
the
sign
of
truth
and
falsehood
is
designated
and
appointed
in
the
book
by
this
touchstone
the
claims
and
pretensions
of
all
men
must
needs
be
assayed
so
that
the
truthful
may
be
known
and
distinguished
from
the
imposter
this
touchstone
is
no
other
than
this
verse
wish
for
death
if
ye
are
men
of
consider
these
martyrs
of
unquestionable
sincerity
to
whose
truthfulness
testifieth
the
explicit
text
of
the
book
and
all
of
whom
as
thou
hast
witnessed
have
sacrificed
their
life
their
substance
their
wives
their
children
their
all
and
ascended
unto
the
loftiest
chambers
of
paradise
is
it
fair
to
reject
the
testimony
of
these
detached
and
exalted
beings
to
the
truth
of
this
and
glorious
revelation
and
to
regard
as
acceptable
the
denunciations
which
have
been
uttered
against
this
resplendent
light
by
this
faithless
people
who
for
gold
have
forsaken
their
faith
and
who
for
the
sake
of
leadership
have
repudiated
him
who
is
the
first
leader
of
all
mankind
this
although
their
character
is
now
revealed
unto
all
people
who
have
recognized
them
as
those
who
will
in
no
wise
relinquish
one
jot
or
one
tittle
of
their
temporal
authority
for
the
sake
of
god
s
holy
faith
how
much
less
their
life
their
substance
and
the
like
behold
how
the
divine
touchstone
hath
according
to
the
explicit
text
of
the
book
separated
and
distinguished
the
true
from
the
false
notwithstanding
they
are
still
oblivious
of
this
truth
and
in
the
sleep
of
heedlessness
are
pursuing
the
vanities
of
the
world
and
are
occupied
with
thoughts
of
vain
and
earthly
leadership
o
son
of
man
many
a
day
hath
passed
over
thee
whilst
thou
hast
busied
thyself
with
thy
fancies
and
idle
imaginings
how
long
art
thou
to
slumber
on
thy
bed
lift
up
thine
head
from
slumber
for
the
sun
hath
risen
to
the
zenith
haply
it
may
shine
upon
thee
with
the
light
of
let
it
be
known
however
that
none
of
these
doctors
and
divines
to
whom
we
have
referred
was
invested
with
the
rank
and
dignity
of
leadership
for
and
influential
leaders
of
religion
who
occupy
the
seats
of
authority
and
exercise
the
functions
of
leadership
can
in
no
wise
bear
allegiance
to
the
revealer
of
truth
except
whomsoever
thy
lord
willeth
but
for
a
few
such
things
have
never
come
to
pass
and
few
of
my
servants
are
the
even
as
in
this
dispensation
not
one
amongst
the
renowned
divines
in
the
grasp
of
whose
authority
were
held
the
reins
of
the
people
hath
embraced
the
faith
nay
they
have
striven
against
it
with
such
animosity
and
determination
that
no
ear
hath
heard
and
no
eye
hath
seen
the
like
the
báb
the
lord
the
most
the
life
of
all
be
a
sacrifice
unto
him
specifically
revealed
an
epistle
unto
the
divines
of
every
city
wherein
he
hath
fully
set
forth
the
character
of
the
denial
and
repudiation
of
each
of
them
wherefore
take
ye
good
heed
ye
who
are
men
of
insight
by
his
references
to
their
opposition
he
intended
to
invalidate
the
objections
which
the
people
of
the
bayán
might
raise
in
the
day
of
the
manifestation
of
mustagháth
the
day
of
the
latter
resurrection
claiming
that
whereas
in
the
dispensation
of
the
bayán
a
number
of
divines
have
embraced
the
faith
in
this
latter
revelation
none
of
these
hath
recognized
his
claim
his
purpose
was
to
warn
the
people
lest
god
forbid
they
cling
to
such
foolish
thoughts
and
deprive
themselves
of
the
divine
beauty
yea
these
divines
to
whom
we
have
referred
were
mostly
unrenowned
and
by
the
grace
of
god
they
were
all
purged
of
earthly
vanities
and
free
from
the
trappings
of
leadership
such
is
the
bounty
of
god
to
whom
he
will
he
giveth
another
proof
and
evidence
of
the
truth
of
this
revelation
which
amongst
all
other
proofs
shineth
as
the
sun
is
the
constancy
of
the
eternal
beauty
in
proclaiming
the
faith
of
god
though
young
and
tender
of
age
and
though
the
cause
he
revealed
was
contrary
to
the
desire
of
all
the
peoples
of
earth
both
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
exalted
and
abased
king
and
subject
yet
he
arose
and
steadfastly
proclaimed
it
all
have
known
and
heard
this
he
was
afraid
of
no
one
he
was
regardless
of
consequences
could
such
a
thing
be
made
manifest
except
through
the
power
of
a
divine
revelation
and
the
potency
of
god
s
invincible
will
by
the
righteousness
of
god
were
any
one
to
entertain
so
great
a
revelation
in
his
heart
the
thought
of
such
a
declaration
would
alone
confound
him
were
the
hearts
of
all
men
to
be
crowded
into
his
heart
he
would
still
hesitate
to
venture
upon
so
awful
an
enterprise
he
could
achieve
it
only
by
the
permission
of
god
only
if
the
channel
of
his
heart
were
to
be
linked
with
the
source
of
divine
grace
and
his
soul
be
assured
of
the
unfailing
sustenance
of
the
almighty
to
what
we
wonder
do
they
ascribe
so
great
a
daring
do
they
accuse
him
of
folly
as
they
accused
the
prophets
of
old
or
do
they
maintain
that
his
motive
was
none
other
than
leadership
and
the
acquisition
of
earthly
riches
gracious
god
in
his
book
which
he
hath
entitled
qayyúmu
first
the
greatest
and
mightiest
of
all
prophesied
his
own
martyrdom
in
it
is
this
passage
o
thou
remnant
of
god
i
have
sacrificed
myself
wholly
for
thee
i
have
accepted
curses
for
thy
sake
and
have
yearned
for
naught
but
martyrdom
in
the
path
of
thy
love
sufficient
witness
unto
me
is
god
the
exalted
the
protector
the
ancient
of
days
likewise
in
his
interpretation
of
the
letter
há
he
craved
martyrdom
saying
methinks
i
heard
a
voice
calling
in
my
inmost
being
do
thou
sacrifice
the
thing
which
thou
lovest
most
in
the
path
of
god
even
as
ḥusayn
peace
be
upon
him
hath
offered
up
his
life
for
my
and
were
i
not
regardful
of
this
inevitable
mystery
by
him
who
hath
my
being
between
his
hands
even
if
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
were
to
be
leagued
together
they
would
be
powerless
to
take
from
me
a
single
letter
how
much
less
can
these
servants
who
are
worthy
of
no
attention
and
who
verily
are
of
the
outcast
that
all
may
know
the
degree
of
my
patience
my
resignation
and
in
the
path
of
could
the
revealer
of
such
utterance
be
regarded
as
walking
any
way
but
the
way
of
god
and
as
having
yearned
for
aught
else
except
his
in
this
very
verse
there
lieth
concealed
a
breath
of
detachment
which
if
it
were
to
be
breathed
full
upon
the
world
all
beings
would
renounce
their
lives
and
sacrifice
their
souls
reflect
upon
the
villainous
behaviour
of
this
generation
and
witness
their
astounding
ingratitude
observe
how
they
have
closed
their
eyes
to
all
this
glory
and
are
abjectly
pursuing
those
foul
carcasses
from
whose
bellies
ascendeth
the
cry
of
the
swallowed
substance
of
the
faithful
and
yet
what
unseemly
calumnies
they
have
hurled
against
those
daysprings
of
holiness
thus
do
we
recount
unto
thee
that
which
the
hands
of
the
infidels
have
wrought
they
who
in
the
day
of
resurrection
have
turned
their
face
away
from
the
divine
presence
whom
god
hath
tormented
with
the
fire
of
their
own
misbelief
and
for
whom
he
hath
prepared
in
the
world
to
come
a
chastisement
which
shall
devour
both
their
bodies
and
souls
for
these
have
said
god
is
powerless
and
his
hand
of
mercy
is
steadfastness
in
the
faith
is
a
sure
testimony
and
a
glorious
evidence
of
the
truth
even
as
the
seal
of
the
prophets
hath
said
two
verses
have
made
me
both
these
verses
are
indicative
of
constancy
in
the
cause
of
god
even
as
he
saith
be
thou
steadfast
as
thou
hast
been
and
now
consider
how
this
sadrih
of
the
ridván
of
god
hath
in
the
prime
of
youth
risen
to
proclaim
the
cause
of
god
behold
what
steadfastness
that
beauty
of
god
hath
revealed
the
whole
world
rose
to
hinder
him
yet
it
utterly
failed
the
more
severe
the
persecution
they
inflicted
on
that
sadrih
of
blessedness
the
more
his
fervour
increased
and
the
brighter
burned
the
flame
of
his
love
all
this
is
evident
and
none
disputeth
its
truth
finally
he
surrendered
his
soul
and
winged
his
flight
unto
the
realms
above
and
among
the
evidences
of
the
truth
of
his
manifestation
were
the
ascendancy
the
transcendent
power
and
supremacy
which
he
the
revealer
of
being
and
manifestation
of
the
adored
hath
unaided
and
alone
revealed
throughout
the
world
no
sooner
had
that
eternal
beauty
revealed
himself
in
in
the
year
sixty
and
rent
asunder
the
veil
of
concealment
than
the
signs
of
the
ascendancy
the
might
the
sovereignty
and
power
emanating
from
that
essence
of
essences
and
sea
of
seas
were
manifest
in
every
land
so
much
so
that
from
every
city
there
appeared
the
signs
the
evidences
the
tokens
the
testimonies
of
that
divine
luminary
how
many
were
those
pure
and
kindly
hearts
which
faithfully
reflected
the
light
of
that
eternal
sun
and
how
manifold
the
emanations
of
knowledge
from
that
ocean
of
divine
wisdom
which
encompassed
all
beings
in
every
city
all
the
divines
and
dignitaries
rose
to
hinder
and
repress
them
and
girded
up
the
loins
of
malice
of
envy
and
tyranny
for
their
suppression
how
great
the
number
of
those
holy
souls
those
essences
of
justice
who
accused
of
tyranny
were
put
to
death
and
how
many
embodiments
of
purity
who
showed
forth
naught
but
true
knowledge
and
stainless
deeds
suffered
an
agonizing
death
notwithstanding
all
this
each
of
these
holy
beings
up
to
his
last
moment
breathed
the
name
of
god
and
soared
in
the
realm
of
submission
and
resignation
such
was
the
potency
and
transmuting
influence
which
he
exercised
over
them
that
they
ceased
to
cherish
any
desire
but
his
will
and
wedded
their
soul
to
his
remembrance
reflect
who
in
this
world
is
able
to
manifest
such
transcendent
power
such
pervading
influence
all
these
stainless
hearts
and
sanctified
souls
have
with
absolute
resignation
responded
to
the
summons
of
his
decree
instead
of
complaining
they
rendered
thanks
unto
god
and
amidst
the
darkness
of
their
anguish
they
revealed
naught
but
radiant
acquiescence
to
his
will
it
is
evident
how
relentless
was
the
hate
and
how
bitter
the
malice
and
enmity
entertained
by
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
towards
these
companions
the
persecution
and
pain
they
inflicted
on
these
holy
and
spiritual
beings
were
regarded
by
them
as
means
unto
salvation
prosperity
and
everlasting
success
hath
the
world
since
the
days
of
adam
witnessed
such
tumult
such
violent
commotion
notwithstanding
all
the
torture
they
suffered
and
manifold
the
afflictions
they
endured
they
became
the
object
of
universal
opprobrium
and
execration
methinks
patience
was
revealed
only
by
virtue
of
their
fortitude
and
faithfulness
itself
was
begotten
only
by
their
deeds
do
thou
ponder
these
momentous
happenings
in
thy
heart
so
that
thou
mayest
apprehend
the
greatness
of
this
revelation
and
perceive
its
stupendous
glory
then
shall
the
spirit
of
faith
through
the
grace
of
the
merciful
be
breathed
into
thy
being
and
thou
shalt
be
established
and
abide
upon
the
seat
of
certitude
the
one
god
is
my
witness
wert
thou
to
ponder
a
while
thou
wilt
recognize
that
apart
from
all
these
established
truths
and
evidences
the
repudiation
cursing
and
execration
pronounced
by
the
people
of
the
earth
are
in
themselves
the
mightiest
proof
and
the
surest
testimony
of
the
truth
of
these
heroes
of
the
field
of
resignation
and
detachment
whenever
thou
dost
meditate
upon
the
cavils
uttered
by
all
the
people
be
they
divines
learned
or
ignorant
the
firmer
and
the
more
steadfast
wilt
thou
grow
in
the
faith
for
whatsoever
hath
come
to
pass
hath
been
prophesied
by
them
who
are
the
mines
of
divine
knowledge
and
recipients
of
god
s
eternal
law
although
we
did
not
intend
to
make
mention
of
the
traditions
of
a
bygone
age
yet
because
of
our
love
for
thee
we
will
cite
a
few
which
are
applicable
to
our
argument
we
do
not
feel
their
necessity
however
inasmuch
as
the
things
we
have
already
mentioned
suffice
the
world
and
all
that
is
therein
in
fact
all
the
scriptures
and
the
mysteries
thereof
are
condensed
into
this
brief
account
so
much
so
that
were
a
person
to
ponder
it
a
while
in
his
heart
he
would
discover
from
all
that
hath
been
said
the
mysteries
of
the
words
of
god
and
would
apprehend
the
meaning
of
whatever
hath
been
manifested
by
that
ideal
king
as
the
people
differ
in
their
understanding
and
station
we
will
accordingly
make
mention
of
a
few
traditions
that
these
may
impart
constancy
to
the
wavering
soul
and
tranquillity
to
the
troubled
mind
thereby
will
the
testimony
of
god
unto
the
people
both
high
and
low
be
complete
and
perfect
among
them
is
the
tradition
and
when
the
standard
of
truth
is
made
manifest
the
people
of
both
the
east
and
the
west
curse
the
wine
of
renunciation
must
needs
be
quaffed
the
lofty
heights
of
detachment
must
needs
be
attained
and
the
meditation
referred
to
in
the
words
one
hour
s
reflection
is
preferable
to
seventy
years
of
pious
worship
must
needs
be
observed
so
that
the
secret
of
the
wretched
behaviour
of
the
people
might
be
discovered
those
people
who
despite
the
love
and
yearning
for
truth
which
they
profess
curse
the
followers
of
truth
when
once
he
hath
been
made
manifest
to
this
truth
the
tradition
beareth
witness
it
is
evident
that
the
reason
for
such
behaviour
is
none
other
than
the
annulment
of
those
rules
customs
habits
and
ceremonials
to
which
they
have
been
subjected
otherwise
were
the
beauty
of
the
merciful
to
comply
with
those
same
rules
and
customs
which
are
current
amongst
the
people
and
were
he
to
sanction
their
observances
such
conflict
and
mischief
would
in
no
wise
be
made
manifest
in
the
world
this
exalted
tradition
is
attested
and
substantiated
by
these
words
which
he
hath
revealed
the
day
when
the
summoner
shall
summon
to
a
stern
the
divine
call
of
the
celestial
herald
from
beyond
the
veil
of
glory
summoning
mankind
to
renounce
utterly
all
the
things
to
which
they
cleave
is
repugnant
to
their
desire
and
this
is
the
cause
of
the
bitter
trials
and
violent
commotions
which
have
occurred
consider
the
way
of
the
people
they
ignore
these
traditions
all
of
which
have
been
fulfilled
and
cling
unto
those
of
doubtful
validity
and
ask
why
these
have
not
been
fulfilled
and
yet
those
things
which
to
them
were
inconceivable
have
been
made
manifest
the
signs
and
tokens
of
the
truth
shine
even
as
the
midday
sun
and
yet
the
people
are
wandering
aimlessly
and
perplexedly
in
the
wilderness
of
ignorance
and
folly
notwithstanding
all
the
verses
of
the
qur
án
and
the
recognized
traditions
which
are
all
indicative
of
a
new
faith
a
new
law
and
a
new
revelation
this
generation
still
waiteth
in
expectation
of
beholding
the
promised
one
who
should
uphold
the
law
of
the
muḥammadan
dispensation
the
jews
and
the
christians
in
like
manner
uphold
the
same
contention
among
the
utterances
that
foreshadow
a
new
law
and
a
new
revelation
are
the
passages
in
the
prayer
of
nudbih
where
is
he
who
is
preserved
to
renew
the
ordinances
and
laws
where
is
he
who
hath
the
authority
to
transform
the
faith
and
the
followers
thereof
he
hath
likewise
revealed
in
the
zíyárat
peace
be
upon
the
truth
made
abdi
lláh
questioned
concerning
the
character
of
the
mihdí
answered
saying
he
will
perform
that
which
muḥammad
the
messenger
of
god
hath
performed
and
will
demolish
whatever
hath
been
before
him
even
as
the
messenger
of
god
hath
demolished
the
ways
of
those
that
preceded
behold
how
notwithstanding
these
and
similar
traditions
they
idly
contend
that
the
laws
formerly
revealed
must
in
no
wise
be
altered
and
yet
is
not
the
object
of
every
revelation
to
effect
a
transformation
in
the
whole
character
of
mankind
a
transformation
that
shall
manifest
itself
both
outwardly
and
inwardly
that
shall
affect
both
its
inner
life
and
external
conditions
for
if
the
character
of
mankind
be
not
changed
the
futility
of
god
s
universal
manifestations
would
be
apparent
in
the
aválím
an
authoritative
and
book
it
is
recorded
a
youth
from
shall
be
made
manifest
who
will
reveal
a
new
book
and
promulgate
a
new
law
then
follow
these
words
most
of
his
enemies
will
be
the
in
another
passage
it
is
related
of
ṣádiq
son
of
muḥammad
that
he
spoke
the
following
there
shall
appear
a
youth
from
who
will
bid
the
people
plight
fealty
unto
him
his
book
will
be
a
new
book
unto
which
he
shall
summon
the
people
to
pledge
their
faith
stern
is
his
revelation
unto
the
arab
if
ye
hear
about
him
hasten
unto
how
well
have
they
followed
the
directions
of
the
imáms
of
the
faith
and
lamps
of
certitude
although
it
is
clearly
stated
were
ye
to
hear
that
a
youth
from
hath
appeared
summoning
the
people
unto
a
new
and
divine
book
and
to
new
and
divine
laws
hasten
unto
him
yet
have
they
all
declared
that
lord
of
being
an
infidel
and
pronounced
him
a
heretic
they
hastened
not
unto
that
háshimite
light
that
divine
manifestation
except
with
drawn
swords
and
hearts
filled
with
malice
moreover
observe
how
explicitly
the
enmity
of
the
divines
hath
been
mentioned
in
the
books
notwithstanding
all
these
evident
and
significant
traditions
all
these
unmistakable
and
undisputed
allusions
the
people
have
rejected
the
immaculate
essence
of
knowledge
and
of
holy
utterance
and
have
turned
unto
the
exponents
of
rebellion
and
error
despite
these
recorded
traditions
and
revealed
utterances
they
speak
only
that
which
is
prompted
by
their
own
selfish
desires
and
should
the
essence
of
truth
reveal
that
which
is
contrary
to
their
inclinations
and
desires
they
will
straightway
denounce
him
as
an
infidel
and
will
protest
saying
this
is
contrary
to
the
sayings
of
the
imáms
of
the
faith
and
of
the
resplendent
lights
no
such
thing
hath
been
provided
by
our
inviolable
even
so
in
this
day
such
worthless
statements
have
been
and
are
being
made
by
these
poor
mortals
and
now
consider
this
other
tradition
and
observe
how
all
these
things
have
been
foretold
in
arbá
in
it
is
recorded
out
of
there
shall
come
forth
a
youth
who
shall
reveal
new
laws
he
shall
summon
the
people
unto
him
but
none
will
heed
his
call
most
of
his
enemies
will
be
the
divines
his
bidding
they
will
not
obey
but
will
protest
saying
this
is
contrary
to
that
which
hath
been
handed
down
unto
us
by
the
imáms
of
the
in
this
day
all
are
repeating
these
very
same
words
utterly
unaware
that
he
is
established
upon
the
throne
of
he
doeth
whatsoever
he
willeth
and
abideth
upon
the
seat
of
he
ordaineth
whatsoever
he
no
understanding
can
grasp
the
nature
of
his
revelation
nor
can
any
knowledge
comprehend
the
full
measure
of
his
faith
all
sayings
are
dependent
upon
his
sanction
and
all
things
stand
in
need
of
his
cause
all
else
save
him
are
created
by
his
command
and
move
and
have
their
being
through
his
law
he
is
the
revealer
of
the
divine
mysteries
and
the
expounder
of
the
hidden
and
ancient
wisdom
thus
it
is
related
in
the
biháru
the
aválím
and
the
yanbú
of
ṣádiq
son
of
muḥammad
that
he
spoke
these
words
knowledge
is
twenty
and
seven
letters
all
that
the
prophets
have
revealed
are
two
letters
thereof
no
man
thus
far
hath
known
more
than
these
two
letters
but
when
the
qá
im
shall
arise
he
will
cause
the
remaining
twenty
and
five
letters
to
be
made
consider
he
hath
declared
knowledge
to
consist
of
twenty
and
seven
letters
and
regarded
all
the
prophets
from
adam
even
unto
the
seal
as
expounders
of
only
two
letters
thereof
and
of
having
been
sent
down
with
these
two
letters
he
also
saith
that
the
qá
im
will
reveal
all
the
remaining
twenty
and
five
letters
behold
from
this
utterance
how
great
and
lofty
is
his
station
his
rank
excelleth
that
of
all
the
prophets
and
his
revelation
transcendeth
the
comprehension
and
understanding
of
all
their
chosen
ones
a
revelation
of
which
the
prophets
of
god
his
saints
and
chosen
ones
have
either
not
been
informed
or
which
in
pursuance
of
god
s
inscrutable
decree
they
have
not
disclosed
a
revelation
these
mean
and
depraved
people
have
sought
to
measure
with
their
own
deficient
minds
their
own
deficient
learning
and
understanding
should
it
fail
to
conform
to
their
standards
they
straightway
reject
it
thinkest
thou
that
the
greater
part
of
them
hear
or
understand
they
are
even
like
unto
the
brutes
yea
they
stray
even
further
from
the
path
how
we
wonder
do
they
explain
the
aforementioned
tradition
a
tradition
which
in
unmistakable
terms
foreshadoweth
the
revelation
of
things
inscrutable
and
the
occurrence
of
new
and
wondrous
events
in
his
day
such
marvellous
happenings
kindle
so
great
a
strife
amongst
the
people
that
all
the
divines
and
doctors
sentence
him
and
his
companions
to
death
and
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
arise
to
oppose
him
even
as
it
hath
been
recorded
in
the
káfí
in
the
tradition
of
jabír
in
the
tablet
of
fátimih
concerning
the
character
of
the
qá
im
he
shall
manifest
the
perfection
of
moses
the
splendour
of
jesus
and
the
patience
of
job
his
chosen
ones
shall
be
abased
in
his
day
their
heads
shall
be
offered
as
presents
even
as
the
heads
of
the
turks
and
the
daylamites
they
shall
be
slain
and
burnt
fear
shall
seize
them
dismay
and
alarm
shall
strike
terror
into
their
hearts
the
earth
shall
be
dyed
with
their
blood
their
womenfolk
shall
bewail
and
lament
these
indeed
are
my
friends
consider
not
a
single
letter
of
this
tradition
hath
remained
unfulfilled
in
most
of
the
places
their
blessed
blood
hath
been
shed
in
every
city
they
have
been
made
captives
have
been
paraded
throughout
the
provinces
and
some
have
been
burnt
with
fire
and
yet
no
one
hath
paused
to
reflect
that
if
the
promised
qá
im
should
reveal
the
law
and
ordinances
of
a
former
dispensation
why
then
should
such
traditions
have
been
recorded
and
why
should
there
arise
such
a
degree
of
strife
and
conflict
that
the
people
should
regard
the
slaying
of
these
companions
as
an
obligation
imposed
upon
them
and
deem
the
persecution
of
these
holy
souls
as
a
means
of
attaining
unto
the
highest
favour
moreover
observe
how
these
things
that
have
come
to
pass
and
the
acts
which
have
been
perpetrated
have
all
been
mentioned
in
former
traditions
even
as
it
hath
been
recorded
in
the
concerning
in
the
it
is
related
of
mu
áviyih
son
of
vahháb
that
abdi
lláh
hath
spoken
knowest
thou
zawrá
i
said
may
my
life
be
a
sacrifice
unto
thee
they
say
it
is
nay
he
answered
and
then
added
hast
thou
entered
the
city
of
rayy
to
which
i
made
reply
yea
i
have
entered
whereupon
he
enquired
didst
thou
visit
the
yea
i
answered
he
said
hast
thou
seen
the
black
mountain
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
road
the
same
is
zawrá
there
shall
eighty
men
of
the
children
of
certain
ones
be
slain
all
of
whom
are
worthy
to
be
called
who
will
slay
them
i
asked
he
made
reply
the
children
of
persia
such
is
the
condition
and
fate
of
his
companions
which
in
former
days
hath
been
foretold
and
now
observe
how
according
to
this
tradition
zawrá
is
no
other
but
the
land
of
rayy
in
that
place
his
companions
have
been
with
great
suffering
put
to
death
and
all
these
holy
beings
have
suffered
martyrdom
at
the
hand
of
the
persians
as
recorded
in
the
tradition
this
thou
hast
heard
and
unto
it
all
testify
wherefore
then
do
not
these
grovelling
men
pause
to
meditate
upon
these
traditions
all
of
which
are
manifest
as
the
sun
in
its
glory
for
what
reason
do
they
refuse
to
embrace
the
truth
and
allow
certain
traditions
the
significance
of
which
they
have
failed
to
grasp
to
withhold
them
from
the
recognition
of
the
revelation
of
god
and
his
beauty
and
to
cause
them
to
dwell
in
the
infernal
abyss
such
things
are
to
be
attributed
to
naught
but
the
faithlessness
of
the
divines

of
these
ṣádiq
son
of
muḥammad
hath
said
the
religious
doctors
of
that
age
shall
be
the
most
wicked
of
the
divines
beneath
the
shadow
of
heaven
out
of
them
hath
mischief
proceeded
and
unto
them
it
shall
we
entreat
the
learned
men
of
the
bayán
not
to
follow
in
such
ways
not
to
inflict
at
the
time
of
mustagháth
upon
him
who
is
the
divine
essence
the
heavenly
light
the
absolute
eternity
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
manifestations
of
the
invisible
that
which
hath
been
inflicted
in
this
day
we
beg
them
not
to
depend
upon
their
intellect
their
comprehension
and
learning
nor
to
contend
with
the
revealer
of
celestial
and
infinite
knowledge
and
yet
notwithstanding
all
these
admonitions
we
perceive
that
a
man
who
himself
is
the
chief
of
the
people
is
arising
with
the
utmost
malevolence
against
us
we
foresee
that
in
every
city
people
will
arise
to
suppress
the
blessed
beauty
that
the
companions
of
that
lord
of
being
and
ultimate
desire
of
all
men
will
flee
from
the
face
of
the
oppressor
and
seek
refuge
from
him
in
the
wilderness
whilst
others
will
resign
themselves
and
with
absolute
detachment
will
sacrifice
their
lives
in
his
path
methinks
we
can
discern
one
who
is
reputed
for
such
devoutness
and
piety
that
men
deem
it
an
obligation
to
obey
him
and
to
whose
command
they
consider
it
necessary
to
submit
who
will
arise
to
assail
the
very
root
of
the
divine
tree
and
endeavour
to
the
uttermost
of
his
power
to
resist
and
oppose
him
such
is
the
way
of
the
people
we
fain
would
hope
that
the
people
of
the
bayán
will
be
enlightened
will
soar
in
the
realm
of
the
spirit
and
abide
therein
will
discern
the
truth
and
recognize
with
the
eye
of
insight
dissembling
falsehood
in
these
days
however
such
odours
of
jealousy
are
diffused
swear
by
the
educator
of
all
beings
visible
and
the
beginning
of
the
foundation
of
the
it
hath
no
the
present
day
such
malice
envy
and
hate
have
in
no
wise
appeared
nor
will
they
ever
be
witnessed
in
the
future
for
a
number
of
people
who
have
never
inhaled
the
fragrance
of
justice
have
raised
the
standard
of
sedition
and
have
leagued
themselves
against
us
on
every
side
we
witness
the
menace
of
their
spears
and
in
all
directions
we
recognize
the
shafts
of
their
arrows
this
although
we
have
never
gloried
in
any
thing
nor
did
we
seek
preference
over
any
soul
to
everyone
we
have
been
a
most
kindly
companion
a
most
forbearing
and
affectionate
friend
in
the
company
of
the
poor
we
have
sought
their
fellowship
and
amidst
the
exalted
and
learned
we
have
been
submissive
and
resigned
i
swear
by
god
the
one
true
god
grievous
as
have
been
the
woes
and
sufferings
which
the
hand
of
the
enemy
and
the
people
of
the
book
inflicted
upon
us
yet
all
these
fade
into
utter
nothingness
when
compared
with
that
which
hath
befallen
us
at
the
hand
of
those
who
profess
to
be
our
friends
what
more
shall
we
say
the
universe
were
it
to
gaze
with
the
eye
of
justice
would
be
incapable
of
bearing
the
weight
of
this
utterance
in
the
early
days
of
our
arrival
in
this
land
when
we
discerned
the
signs
of
impending
events
we
decided
ere
they
happened
to
retire
we
betook
ourselves
to
the
wilderness
and
there
separated
and
alone
led
for
two
years
a
life
of
complete
solitude
from
our
eyes
there
rained
tears
of
anguish
and
in
our
bleeding
heart
there
surged
an
ocean
of
agonizing
pain
many
a
night
we
had
no
food
for
sustenance
and
many
a
day
our
body
found
no
rest
by
him
who
hath
my
being
between
his
hands
notwithstanding
these
showers
of
afflictions
and
unceasing
calamities
our
soul
was
wrapt
in
blissful
joy
and
our
whole
being
evinced
an
ineffable
gladness
for
in
our
solitude
we
were
unaware
of
the
harm
or
benefit
the
health
or
ailment
of
any
soul
alone
we
communed
with
our
spirit
oblivious
of
the
world
and
all
that
is
therein
we
knew
not
however
that
the
mesh
of
divine
destiny
exceedeth
the
vastest
of
mortal
conceptions
and
the
dart
of
his
decree
transcendeth
the
boldest
of
human
designs
none
can
escape
the
snares
he
setteth
and
no
soul
can
find
release
except
through
submission
to
his
will
by
the
righteousness
of
god
our
withdrawal
contemplated
no
return
and
our
separation
hoped
for
no
reunion
the
one
object
of
our
retirement
was
to
avoid
becoming
a
subject
of
discord
among
the
faithful
a
source
of
disturbance
unto
our
companions
the
means
of
injury
to
any
soul
or
the
cause
of
sorrow
to
any
heart
beyond
these
we
cherished
no
other
intention
and
apart
from
them
we
had
no
end
in
view
and
yet
each
person
schemed
after
his
own
desire
and
pursued
his
own
idle
fancy
until
the
hour
when
from
the
mystic
source
there
came
the
summons
bidding
us
return
whence
we
came
surrendering
our
will
to
his
we
submitted
to
his
injunction
what
pen
can
recount
the
things
we
beheld
upon
our
return
two
years
have
elapsed
during
which
our
enemies
have
ceaselessly
and
assiduously
contrived
to
exterminate
us
whereunto
all
witness
nevertheless
none
amongst
the
faithful
hath
risen
to
render
us
any
assistance
nor
did
any
one
feel
inclined
to
help
in
our
deliverance
nay
instead
of
assisting
us
what
showers
of
continuous
sorrows
their
words
and
deeds
have
caused
to
rain
upon
our
soul
amidst
them
all
we
stand
life
in
hand
wholly
resigned
to
his
will
that
perchance
through
god
s
loving
kindness
and
his
grace
this
revealed
and
manifest
letter
may
lay
down
his
life
as
a
sacrifice
in
the
path
of
the
primal
point
the
most
exalted
word
by
him
at
whose
bidding
the
spirit
hath
spoken
but
for
this
yearning
of
our
soul
we
would
not
for
one
moment
have
tarried
any
longer
in
this
city
sufficient
witness
is
god
unto
we
conclude
our
argument
with
the
words
there
is
no
power
nor
strength
but
in
god
we
are
god
s
and
to
him
shall
we
they
that
have
hearts
to
understand
they
that
have
quaffed
the
wine
of
love
who
have
not
for
one
moment
gratified
their
selfish
desires
will
behold
resplendent
as
the
sun
in
its
glory
those
tokens
testimonies
and
evidences
that
attest
the
truth
of
this
wondrous
revelation
this
transcendent
and
divine
faith
reflect
how
the
people
have
rejected
the
beauty
of
god
and
have
clung
unto
their
covetous
desires
notwithstanding
all
these
consummate
verses
these
unmistakable
allusions
which
have
been
revealed
in
the
most
weighty
revelation
the
trust
of
god
amongst
men
and
despite
these
evident
traditions
each
more
manifest
than
the
most
explicit
utterance
the
people
have
ignored
and
repudiated
their
truth
and
have
held
fast
to
the
letter
of
certain
traditions
which
according
to
their
understanding
they
have
found
inconsistent
with
their
expectations
and
the
meaning
of
which
they
have
failed
to
grasp
they
have
thus
shattered
every
hope
and
deprived
themselves
of
the
pure
wine
of
the
and
the
clear
and
incorruptible
waters
of
the
immortal
beauty
consider
that
even
the
year
in
which
that
quintessence
of
light
is
to
be
made
manifest
hath
been
specifically
recorded
in
the
traditions
yet
they
still
remain
unmindful
nor
do
they
for
one
moment
cease
to
pursue
their
selfish
desires
according
to
the
tradition
mufaddál
asked
ṣádiq
saying
what
of
the
sign
of
his
manifestation
o
my
master
he
made
reply
in
the
year
sixty
his
cause
shall
be
made
manifest
and
his
name
shall
be
how
strange
notwithstanding
these
explicit
and
manifest
references
these
people
have
shunned
the
truth
for
instance
mention
of
the
sorrows
the
imprisonment
and
afflictions
inflicted
upon
that
essence
of
divine
virtue
hath
been
made
in
the
former
traditions
in
the
bihár
it
is
recorded
in
our
qá
im
there
shall
be
four
signs
from
four
prophets
moses
jesus
joseph
and
muḥammad
the
sign
from
moses
is
fear
and
expectation
from
jesus
that
which
was
spoken
of
him
from
joseph
imprisonment
and
dissimulation
from
muḥammad
the
revelation
of
a
book
similar
to
the
qur
notwithstanding
such
a
conclusive
tradition
which
in
such
unmistakable
language
hath
foreshadowed
the
happenings
of
the
present
day
none
hath
been
found
to
heed
its
prophecy
and
methinks
none
will
do
so
in
the
future
except
him
whom
thy
lord
willeth
god
indeed
shall
make
whom
he
will
to
hearken
but
we
shall
not
make
those
who
are
in
their
graves
to
it
is
evident
unto
thee
that
the
birds
of
heaven
and
doves
of
eternity
speak
a
twofold
language
one
language
the
outward
language
is
devoid
of
allusions
is
unconcealed
and
unveiled
that
it
may
be
a
guiding
lamp
and
a
beaconing
light
whereby
wayfarers
may
attain
the
heights
of
holiness
and
seekers
may
advance
into
the
realm
of
eternal
reunion
such
are
the
unveiled
traditions
and
the
evident
verses
already
mentioned
the
other
language
is
veiled
and
concealed
so
that
whatever
lieth
hidden
in
the
heart
of
the
malevolent
may
be
made
manifest
and
their
innermost
being
be
disclosed
thus
hath
ṣádiq
son
of
muḥammad
spoken
god
verily
will
test
them
and
sift
this
is
the
divine
standard
this
is
the
touchstone
of
god
wherewith
he
proveth
his
servants
none
apprehendeth
the
meaning
of
these
utterances
except
them
whose
hearts
are
assured
whose
souls
have
found
favour
with
god
and
whose
minds
are
detached
from
all
else
but
him
in
such
utterances
the
literal
meaning
as
generally
understood
by
the
people
is
not
what
hath
been
intended
thus
it
is
recorded
every
knowledge
hath
seventy
meanings
of
which
one
only
is
known
amongst
the
people
and
when
the
qá
im
shall
arise
he
shall
reveal
unto
men
all
that
which
he
also
saith
we
speak
one
word
and
by
it
we
intend
one
and
seventy
meanings
each
one
of
these
meanings
we
can
these
things
we
mention
only
that
the
people
may
not
be
dismayed
because
of
certain
traditions
and
utterances
which
have
not
yet
been
literally
fulfilled
that
they
may
rather
attribute
their
perplexity
to
their
own
lack
of
understanding
and
not
to
the
of
the
promises
in
the
traditions
inasmuch
as
the
meaning
intended
by
the
imáms
of
the
faith
is
not
known
by
this
people
as
evidenced
by
the
traditions
themselves
the
people
therefore
must
not
allow
such
utterances
to
deprive
them
of
the
divine
bounties
but
should
rather
seek
enlightenment
from
them
who
are
the
recognized
expounders
thereof
so
that
the
hidden
mysteries
may
be
unravelled
and
be
made
manifest
unto
them
we
perceive
none
however
amongst
the
people
of
the
earth
who
sincerely
yearning
for
the
truth
seeketh
the
guidance
of
the
divine
manifestations
concerning
the
abstruse
matters
of
his
faith
all
are
dwellers
in
the
land
of
oblivion
and
all
are
followers
of
the
people
of
wickedness
and
rebellion
god
will
verily
do
unto
them
that
which
they
themselves
are
doing
and
will
forget
them
even
as
they
have
ignored
his
presence
in
his
day
such
is
his
decree
unto
those
that
have
denied
him
and
such
will
it
be
unto
them
that
have
rejected
his
signs
we
conclude
our
argument
with
his
is
and
whoso
shall
withdraw
from
the
remembrance
of
the
merciful
we
will
chain
a
satan
unto
him
and
he
shall
be
his
fast
and
whoso
turneth
away
from
my
remembrance
truly
his
shall
be
a
life
of
thus
hath
it
been
revealed
aforetime
were
ye
to
comprehend
revealed
by
the
bá
and
the
peace
be
upon
him
that
inclineth
his
ear
unto
the
melody
of
the
mystic
bird
calling
from
the
sadratu
glorified
be
our
lord
