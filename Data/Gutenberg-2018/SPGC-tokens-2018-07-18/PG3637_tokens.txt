the

caused
by

prevented
domini
enfilden
from
sleeping
there
was
deep
silence
in
the
hotel
de
la
mer
at
robertville
the
french
officers
who
took
their
pension
there
had
long
since
ascended
the
hill
of
addouna
to
the
barracks
the
cafes
had
closed
their
doors
to
the
drinkers
and
domino
players
the
lounging
arab
boys
had
deserted
the
sandy
place
de
la
marine
in
their
small
and
dusky
bazaars
the
israelites
had
reckoned
up
the
takings
of
the
day
and
curled
themselves
up
in
gaudy
quilts
on
their
low
divans
to
rest
only
two
or
three
were
still
about
and
a
few
french
and
spaniards
at
the
port
where
moored
against
the
wharf
lay
the
steamer
general
in
which
domini
had
arrived
that
evening
from
marseilles
in
the
hotel
the
fair
and
plump
italian
waiter
who
had
drifted
to
north
africa
from
pisa
had
swept
up
the
crumbs
from
the
two
long
tables
in
the
smoked
a
thin
dark
cigar
over
a
copy
of
the
put
the
paper
down
scratched
his
blonde
head
on
which
the
hair
stood
up
in
bristles
stared
for
a
while
at
nothing
in
the
firm
manner
of
weary
men
who
are
at
the
same
time
thoughtless
and
depressed
and
thrown
himself
on
his
narrow
bed
in
the
dusty
corner
of
the
little
room
on
the
stairs
near
the
front
door
madame
the
landlady
had
laid
aside
her
front
and
said
her
prayer
to
the
virgin
monsieur
the
landlord
had
muttered
his
last
curse
against
the
jews
and
drunk
his
last
glass
of
rum
they
snored
like
honest
people
recruiting
their
strength
for
the
morrow
in
number
two
suzanne
charpot
domini
s
maid
was
dreaming
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
but
domini
with
eyes
was
staring
from
her
big
square
pillow
at
the
red
brick
floor
of
her
bedroom
on
which
stood
various
trunks
marked
by
the
officials
of
the
douane
there
were
two
windows
in
the
room
looking
out
towards
the
place
de
la
marine
below
which
lay
the
station
closed
of
blistered
wood
protected
them
one
of
these
windows
was
open
yet
the
candle
at
domini
s
bedside
burnt
steadily
the
night
was
warm
and
quiet
without
wind
as
she
lay
there
domini
still
felt
the
movement
of
the
sea
the
passage
had
been
a
bad
one
the
ship
crammed
with
french
recruits
for
the
african
regiments
had
pitched
and
rolled
almost
incessantly
for
hours
and
domini
and
most
of
the
recruits
had
been
domini
had
had
an
inner
cabin
with
a
skylight
opening
on
to
the
lower
deck
and
heard
above
the
sound
of
the
waves
and
winds
their
groans
and
exclamations
rough
laughter
and
conversations
as
she
shook
in
her
berth
at
marseilles
she
had
seen
them
come
on
board
one
by
one
dressed
in
every
variety
of
poor
costume
each
one
looking
anxiously
around
to
see
what
the
others
were
like
each
one
carrying
a
mean
yellow
or
black
bag
or
a
bundle
on
the
wharf
stood
a
zouave
in
tremendous
red
trousers
and
a
fez
among
great
heaps
of
dull
brown
woollen
rugs
and
as
the
recruits
came
hesitatingly
along
he
stopped
them
with
a
sharp
word
examined
the
tickets
they
held
out
gave
each
one
a
rug
and
pointed
to
the
gangway
that
led
from
the
wharf
to
the
vessel
domini
then
leaning
over
the
rail
of
the
upper
deck
had
noticed
the
different
expressions
with
which
the
recruits
looked
at
the
zouave
to
all
of
them
he
was
a
phenomenon
a
mystery
of
africa
and
of
the
new
life
for
which
they
were
embarking
he
stood
there
impudently
and
indifferently
among
the
woollen
rugs
his
red
fez
pushed
well
back
on
his
short
black
hair
cut
his
bronzed
face
twisted
into
a
grimace
of
fiery
contempt
throwing
with
his
big
and
muscular
arms
rug
after
rug
to
the
anxious
young
peasants
who
filed
before
him
they
all
gazed
at
his
legs
in
the
billowing
red
trousers
some
like
children
regarding
a
which
had
just
sprung
up
into
view
others
like
ignorant
but
superstitious
people
who
had
unexpectedly
come
upon
a
shrine
by
the
wayside
one
or
two
seemed
disposed
to
laugh
nervously
as
the
very
stupid
laugh
at
anything
they
see
for
the
first
time
but
fear
seized
them
they
refrained
convulsively
and
shambled
on
to
the
gangway
looking
sideways
like
fowls
and
holding
their
rugs
awkwardly
to
their
breasts
with
their
dirty
red
hands
to
domini
there
was
something
pitiful
in
the
sight
of
all
these
lads
uprooted
from
their
homes
in
france
stumbling
helplessly
on
board
this
ship
that
was
to
convey
them
to
africa
they
crowded
together
their
poor
bundles
and
bags
jostled
one
against
the
other
with
their
clumsy
boots
they
trod
on
each
other
s
feet
and
yet
all
were
lonely
strangers
no
two
in
the
mob
seemed
to
be
acquaintances
and
every
lad
each
in
his
different
way
was
furtively
on
the
defensive
uneasily
wondering
whether
some
misfortune
might
not
presently
come
to
him
from
one
of
these
unknown
neighbours
a
few
of
the
recruits
as
they
came
on
board
looked
up
at
domini
as
she
leant
over
the
rail
and
in
all
the
different
coloured
and
shaped
eyes
she
thought
she
read
a
similar
dread
and
nervous
hope
that
things
might
turn
out
pretty
well
for
them
in
the
new
existence
that
had
to
be
faced
the
zouave
wholly
careless
or
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
he
was
an
incarnation
of
africa
to
these
raw
peasants
who
had
never
before
stirred
beyond
the
provinces
where
they
were
born
went
on
taking
the
tickets
and
tossing
the
woollen
rugs
to
the
passing
figures
and
pointing
ferociously
to
the
gangway
he
got
very
tired
of
his
task
towards
the
end
and
showed
his
fatigue
to
the
latest
comers
shoving
their
rugs
into
their
arms
with
brusque
violence
and
when
at
length
the
wharf
was
bare
he
spat
on
it
rubbed
his
sunburnt
hands
down
the
sides
of
his
blue
jacket
and
swaggered
on
board
with
the
air
of
a
dutiful
but
injured
man
who
longed
to
do
harm
in
the
world
by
this
time
the
ship
was
about
to
cast
off
and
the
recruits
ranged
in
line
along
the
bulwarks
of
the
lower
deck
were
looking
in
silence
towards
marseilles
which
with
its
tangle
of
tall
houses
its
forest
of
masts
its
long
ugly
factories
and
workshops
now
represented
to
them
the
whole
of
france
the
bronchial
hoot
of
the
siren
rose
up
menacingly
suddenly
two
arabs
in
dirty
white
burnouses
and
turbans
bound
with
cords
of
camel
s
hair
came
running
along
the
wharf
the
siren
hooted
again
the
arabs
bounded
over
the
gangway
with
grave
faces
all
the
recruits
turned
to
examine
them
with
a
mixture
of
superiority
and
deference
such
as
a
schoolboy
might
display
when
observing
the
agilities
of
a
tiger
the
ropes
fell
heavily
from
the
posts
of
the
quay
into
the
water
and
were
drawn
up
dripping
by
the
sailors
and
general
began
to
move
out
slowly
among
the
motionless
ships
domini
looking
towards
the
land
with
the
vague
and
yet
inquiring
glance
of
those
who
are
going
out
to
sea
noticed
the
church
of
notre
dame
de
la
garde
perched
on
its
high
hill
and
dominating
the
noisy
city
the
harbour
the
cold
grey
squadrons
of
the
rocks
and
monte
cristo
s
dungeon
at
the
time
she
hardly
knew
it
but
now
as
she
lay
in
bed
in
the
silent
inn
she
remembered
that
keeping
her
eyes
upon
the
church
she
had
murmured
a
confused
prayer
to
the
blessed
virgin
for
the
recruits
what
was
the
prayer
she
could
scarcely
recall
it
a
woman
s
petition
perhaps
against
the
temptations
that
beset
men
shifting
for
themselves
in
and
dangerous
countries
a
woman
s
cry
to
a
woman
to
watch
over
all
those
who
wander
when
the
land
faded
and
the
white
sea
rose
less
romantic
considerations
took
possession
of
her
she
wished
to
sleep
and
drank
a
dose
of
a
drug
it
did
not
act
completely
but
only
numbed
her
senses
through
the
long
hours
she
lay
in
the
dark
cabin
looking
at
the
faint
radiance
that
penetrated
through
the
glass
shutters
of
the
skylight
the
recruits
humanised
and
drawn
together
by
misery
were
becoming
acquainted
the
incessant
murmur
of
their
voices
dropped
down
to
her
with
the
sound
of
the
waves
and
of
the
mysterious
cries
and
creaking
shudders
that
go
through
labouring
ships
and
all
these
noises
seemed
to
her
hoarse
and
pathetic
suggestive
too
of
danger
when
they
reached
the
african
shore
and
saw
the
lights
of
houses
twinkling
upon
the
hills
the
pale
recruits
were
marshalled
on
the
white
road
by
zouaves
who
met
them
from
the
barracks
of
robertville
already
they
looked
older
than
they
had
looked
when
they
embarked
domini
saw
them
march
away
up
the
hill
they
still
clung
to
their
bags
and
bundles
some
of
them
lifting
shaky
voices
tried
to
sing
in
chorus
one
of
the
zouaves
angrily
shouted
to
them
to
be
quiet
they
obeyed
and
disappeared
heavily
into
the
shadows
staring
about
them
anxiously
at
the
feathery
palms
that
clustered
in
this
new
and
dark
country
and
at
the
shrouded
figures
of
arabs
who
met
them
on
the
way
the
red
brick
floor
was
heaving
gently
domini
thought
she
found
herself
wondering
how
the
cane
chair
by
the
small
wardrobe
kept
its
footing
and
why
the
cracked
china
basin
in
the
iron
washstand
painted
bright
yellow
did
not
stir
and
rattle
her
was
open
she
could
see
the
silver
backs
and
tops
of
the
brushes
and
bottles
in
it
gleaming
they
made
her
think
suddenly
of
england
she
had
no
idea
why
but
it
was
too
warm
for
england
there
in
the
autumn
time
an
open
window
would
let
in
a
cold
air
probably
a
biting
blast
the
wooden
shutter
would
be
shaking
there
would
be
perhaps
a
sound
of
rain
and
domini
found
herself
vaguely
pitying
england
and
the
people
mewed
up
in
it
for
the
winter
yet
how
many
winters
she
had
spent
there
dreaming
of
liberty
and
doing
dreary
things
things
without
savour
without
meaning
without
salvation
for
brain
or
soul
her
mind
was
still
dulled
to
a
certain
extent
by
the
narcotic
she
had
taken
she
was
a
strong
and
active
woman
with
long
limbs
and
muscles
a
clever
fencer
a
tireless
swimmer
a
fine
horsewoman
but
she
felt
almost
neurotic
like
one
of
the
weak
or
dissipated
sisterhood
for
whom
rest
cures
are
invented
and
by
whom
bland
doctors
live
that
heaving
red
floor
continually
emphasised
for
her
her
present
feebleness
she
hated
feebleness
so
she
blew
out
the
candle
and
with
misplaced
energy
strove
resolutely
to
sleep
possibly
her
resolution
defeated
its
object
she
continued
in
a
condition
of
dull
and
heavy
wakefulness
till
the
darkness
became
intolerable
to
her
in
it
she
saw
perpetually
the
long
procession
of
the
pale
recruits
winding
up
the
hill
of
addouna
with
their
bags
and
bundles
like
spectres
on
a
way
of
dreams
finally
she
resolved
to
accept
a
sleepless
night
she
lit
her
candle
again
and
saw
that
the
brick
floor
was
no
longer
heaving
two
of
the
books
that
she
called
her
lay
within
easy
reach
of
her
hand
one
was
newman
s
of
the
other
a
volume
of
the
badminton
library
she
chose
the
former
and
began
to
read
towards
two
o
clock
she
heard
a
rustling
at
first
she
supposed
that
her
tired
brain
was
still
playing
her
tricks
but
the
rustling
continued
and
grew
louder
it
sounded
like
a
noise
coming
from
something
very
wide
and
spread
out
as
a
veil
over
an
immense
surface
she
got
up
walked
across
the
floor
to
the
open
window
and
unfastened
the
heavy
rain
was
falling
the
night
was
very
black
and
smelt
rich
and
damp
as
if
it
held
in
its
arms
strange
offerings
a
merchandise
altogether
foreign
tropical
and
alluring
as
she
stood
there
face
to
face
with
a
wonder
that
she
could
not
see
domini
forgot
newman
she
felt
the
brave
companionship
of
mystery
in
it
she
divined
the
beating
pulses
the
hot
surging
blood
of
freedom
she
wanted
freedom
a
wide
horizon
the
great
winds
the
great
sun
the
terrible
spaces
the
glowing
shimmering
radiance
the
hot
entrancing
moons
and
bloomy
purple
nights
of
africa
she
wanted
the
nomad
s
fires
and
the
acid
voices
of
the
kabyle
dogs
she
wanted
the
roar
of
the
the
dash
of
the
cymbals
the
rattle
of
the
negroes
castanets
the
fluttering
painted
figures
of
the
dancers
she
wanted
more
than
she
could
express
more
than
she
knew
it
was
there
want
aching
in
her
heart
as
she
drew
into
her
nostrils
this
strange
and
wealthy
atmosphere
when
domini
returned
to
her
bed
she
found
it
impossible
to
read
any
more
newman
the
rain
and
the
scents
coming
up
out
of
the
hidden
earth
of
africa
had
carried
her
mind
away
as
if
on
a
magic
carpet
she
was
content
now
to
lie
awake
in
the
dark
domini
was
unmarried
and
in
a
singularly
independent
some
might
have
thought
a
singularly
lonely
situation
her
father
lord
rens
had
recently
died
leaving
domini
who
was
his
only
child
a
large
fortune
his
life
had
been
a
curious
and
a
tragic
one
lady
rens
domini
s
mother
had
been
a
great
beauty
of
the
gipsy
type
the
daughter
of
a
hungarian
mother
and
of
sir
henry
arlworth
one
of
the
most
prominent
and
ardent
english
catholics
of
his
day
a
son
of
his
became
a
priest
and
a
famous
preacher
and
writer
on
religious
subjects
another
child
a
daughter
took
the
veil
lady
rens
who
was
not
clever
although
she
was
at
one
time
almost
universally
considered
to
have
the
face
of
a
muse
shared
in
the
family
ardour
for
the
church
but
was
far
too
fond
of
the
world
to
leave
it
while
she
was
very
young
she
met
lord
rens
a
lifeguardsman
of
who
called
himself
a
protestant
but
who
was
really
quite
happy
without
any
faith
he
fell
madly
in
love
with
her
and
in
order
to
marry
her
became
a
catholic
and
even
a
very
devout
one
aiding
his
wife
s
church
by
every
means
in
his
power
giving
large
sums
to
catholic
charities
and
working
with
almost
fiery
zeal
for
the
spread
of
catholicism
in
england
unfortunately
his
new
faith
was
founded
only
on
love
for
a
human
being
and
when
lady
rens
who
was
intensely
passionate
and
impulsive
suddenly
threw
all
her
principles
to
the
winds
and
ran
away
with
a
hungarian
musician
who
had
made
a
furor
one
season
in
london
by
his
magnificent
her
husband
stricken
in
his
soul
and
also
wounded
almost
to
the
death
in
his
pride
abandoned
abruptly
the
religion
of
the
woman
who
had
converted
and
betrayed
him
domini
was
nineteen
and
had
recently
been
presented
at
court
when
the
scandal
of
her
mother
s
escapade
shook
the
town
and
changed
her
father
in
a
day
from
one
of
the
happiest
to
one
of
the
most
cynical
embittered
and
despairing
of
men
she
who
had
been
brought
up
by
both
her
parents
as
a
catholic
who
had
from
her
earliest
years
been
earnestly
educated
in
the
beauties
of
religion
was
now
exposed
to
the
almost
frantic
persuasions
of
a
father
who
hating
all
that
he
had
formerly
loved
abandoning
all
that
influenced
by
his
faithless
wife
he
had
formerly
clung
to
wished
to
carry
his
daughter
with
him
into
his
new
and
most
miserable
way
of
life
but
domini
who
with
much
of
her
mother
s
dark
beauty
had
inherited
much
of
her
quick
vehemence
and
passion
was
also
gifted
with
brains
and
with
a
certain
largeness
of
temperament
and
clearness
of
insight
which
lady
rens
lacked
even
when
she
was
still
quivering
under
the
shock
and
shame
of
her
mother
s
guilt
and
her
own
solitude
domini
was
unable
to
share
her
father
s
intensely
egoistic
view
of
the
religion
of
the
culprit
she
could
not
be
persuaded
that
the
faith
in
which
she
had
been
brought
up
was
proved
to
be
a
sham
because
one
of
its
professors
whom
she
had
above
all
others
loved
and
trusted
had
broken
away
from
its
teachings
and
defied
her
own
belief
she
would
not
secede
with
her
father
but
remained
in
the
church
of
the
mother
she
was
never
to
see
again
and
this
in
spite
of
extraordinary
and
dogged
efforts
on
the
part
of
lord
rens
to
pervert
her
to
his
own
atheism
his
mind
had
been
so
warped
by
the
agony
of
his
heart
that
he
had
come
to
feel
as
if
by
tearing
his
only
child
from
the
religion
he
had
been
led
to
by
the
greatest
sinner
he
had
known
he
would
be
in
some
degree
at
least
purifying
his
life
tarnished
by
his
wife
s
conduct
raising
again
a
little
way
the
pride
she
had
trampled
in
the
dust
her
uncle
father
arlworth
helped
domini
by
his
support
and
counsel
in
this
critical
period
of
her
life
and
lord
rens
in
time
ceased
from
the
endeavour
to
carry
his
child
with
him
as
companion
in
his
tragic
journey
from
love
and
belief
to
hatred
and
denial
he
turned
to
the
violent
occupations
of
despair
and
the
last
years
of
his
life
were
hideous
enough
as
the
world
knew
and
domini
sometimes
suspected
but
though
domini
had
resisted
him
she
was
not
unmoved
or
wholly
uninfluenced
by
her
mother
s
desertion
and
its
effect
upon
her
father
she
remained
a
catholic
but
she
gradually
ceased
from
being
a
devout
one
although
she
had
seemed
to
stand
firm
she
had
in
truth
been
shaken
if
not
in
her
belief
in
a
more
precious
thing
her
love
she
complied
with
the
ordinances
but
felt
little
of
the
inner
beauty
of
her
faith
the
effort
she
had
made
in
withstanding
her
father
s
assault
upon
it
had
exhausted
her
though
she
had
had
the
strength
to
triumph
at
the
moment
a
partial
and
secret
collapse
was
the
price
she
had
afterwards
to
pay
father
arlworth
who
had
a
subtle
understanding
of
human
nature
noticed
that
domini
was
changed
and
slightly
hardened
by
the
tragedy
she
had
known
and
was
not
surprised
or
shocked
nor
did
he
attempt
to
force
her
character
back
into
its
former
way
of
beauty
he
knew
that
to
do
so
would
be
dangerous
that
domini
s
nature
required
peace
in
which
to
become
absolutely
normal
once
again
after
the
shock
it
had
sustained
when
domini
was
he
died
and
her
safest
guide
the
one
who
understood
her
best
went
from
her
the
years
passed
she
lived
with
her
embittered
father
and
drifted
into
the
unthinking
worldliness
of
the
life
of
her
order
her
home
was
far
from
ideal
yet
she
would
not
marry
the
wreck
of
her
parents
domestic
life
had
rendered
her
mistrustful
of
human
relations
she
had
seen
something
of
the
terror
of
love
and
could
not
like
other
women
regard
it
as
safety
and
as
sweetness
so
she
put
it
from
her
and
strove
to
fill
her
life
with
all
those
lesser
things
which
men
and
women
grasp
as
the
chinese
grasp
the
opium
pipe
those
things
which
lull
our
comprehension
of
realities
to
sleep
when
lord
rens
died
still
blaspheming
and
without
any
of
the
consolations
of
religion
domini
felt
the
imperious
need
of
change
she
did
not
grieve
actively
for
the
dead
man
in
his
last
years
they
had
been
very
far
apart
and
his
death
relieved
her
from
the
perpetual
contemplation
of
a
tragedy
lord
rens
had
grown
to
regard
his
daughter
almost
with
enmity
in
his
enmity
against
her
mother
s
religion
which
was
hers
she
had
come
to
think
of
him
rather
with
pity
than
with
love
yet
his
death
was
a
shock
to
her
when
he
could
speak
no
more
but
only
lie
still
she
remembered
suddenly
just
what
he
had
been
before
her
mother
s
flight
the
succeeding
period
long
though
it
had
been
and
ugly
was
blotted
out
she
wept
for
the
poor
broken
life
now
ended
and
was
afraid
for
his
future
in
the
other
world
his
departure
into
the
unknown
roused
her
abruptly
to
a
clear
conception
of
how
his
action
and
her
mother
s
had
affected
her
own
character
as
she
stood
by
his
bed
she
wondered
what
she
might
have
been
if
her
mother
had
been
true
her
father
happy
to
the
end
then
she
felt
afraid
of
herself
recognising
partially
and
for
the
first
time
how
all
these
years
had
seen
her
long
indifference
she
felt
too
ignorant
of
the
real
meaning
of
life
and
as
if
she
had
always
been
and
still
remained
rather
a
complicated
piece
of
mechanism
than
a
woman
a
desolate
enervation
of
spirit
descended
upon
her
a
sort
of
bitter
and
yet
dull
perplexity
she
began
to
wonder
what
she
was
capable
of
what
of
how
much
good
or
evil
and
to
feel
sure
that
she
did
not
know
had
never
known
or
tried
to
find
out
once
in
this
state
of
mind
she
went
to
confession
she
came
away
feeling
that
she
had
just
joined
with
the
priest
in
a
farce
how
can
a
woman
who
knows
nothing
about
herself
make
anything
but
a
worthless
confession
she
thought
to
say
what
you
have
done
is
not
always
to
say
what
you
are
and
only
what
you
are
matters
eternally
presently
still
in
this
perplexity
of
spirit
she
left
england
with
only
her
maid
as
companion
after
a
short
tour
in
the
south
of
europe
with
which
she
was
too
familiar
she
crossed
the
sea
to
africa
which
she
had
never
seen
her
destination
was
she
had
chosen
it
because
she
liked
its
name
because
she
saw
on
the
map
that
it
was
an
oasis
in
the
sahara
desert
because
she
knew
it
was
small
quiet
yet
face
to
face
with
an
immensity
of
which
she
had
often
dreamed
idly
she
fancied
that
perhaps
in
the
sunny
solitude
of
far
from
all
the
friends
and
reminiscences
of
her
old
life
she
might
learn
to
understand
herself
how
she
did
not
know
she
did
not
seek
to
know
here
was
a
vague
pilgrimage
as
many
pilgrimages
are
in
this
world
the
journey
of
the
searcher
who
knew
not
what
she
sought
and
so
now
she
lay
in
the
dark
and
heard
the
rustle
of
the
warm
african
rain
and
smelt
the
perfumes
rising
from
the
ground
and
felt
that
the
unknown
was
very
near
her
the
unknown
with
all
its
blessed
possibilities
of
change
chapter
ii
long
before
dawn
the
italian
waiter
rolled
off
his
little
bed
put
a
cap
on
his
head
and
knocked
at
domini
s
and
at
suzanne
charpot
s
doors
it
was
still
dark
and
still
raining
when
the
two
women
came
out
to
get
into
the
carriage
that
was
to
take
them
to
the
station
the
place
de
la
marine
was
a
sea
of
mud
brown
and
sticky
as
nougat
wet
palms
dripped
by
the
railing
near
a
desolate
kiosk
painted
green
and
blue
the
sky
was
grey
and
low
curtains
of
tarpaulin
were
let
down
on
each
side
of
the
carriage
and
the
coachman
who
looked
like
a
maltese
and
wore
a
round
cap
edged
with
pale
yellow
fur
was
muffled
up
to
the
ears
suzanne
s
round
white
face
was
puffy
with
fatigue
and
her
dark
eyes
generally
and
hopeful
were
dreary
and
squinted
slightly
as
she
tipped
the
italian
waiter
and
handed
her
mistress
s
and
rug
into
the
carriage
the
waiter
stood
an
the
discoloured
step
yawning
from
ear
to
ear
even
the
tip
could
not
excite
him
before
the
carriage
started
he
had
gone
into
the
hotel
and
banged
the
door
the
horses
trotted
quickly
through
the
mud
descending
the
hill
one
of
the
tarpaulin
curtains
had
been
left
unbuttoned
by
the
coachman
it
flapped
to
and
fro
and
when
its
movement
was
outward
domini
could
catch
short
glimpses
of
mud
of
glistening
with
yellow
stems
of
and
of
something
that
was
like
an
extended
grey
nothingness
this
was
the
sea
twice
she
saw
arabs
trudging
along
holding
their
skirts
up
in
a
bunch
sideways
and
showing
legs
bare
beyond
the
knees
hoods
hid
their
faces
they
appeared
to
be
agitated
by
the
weather
and
to
be
continually
trying
to
plant
their
naked
feet
in
dry
places
suzanne
who
sat
opposite
to
domini
had
her
eyes
shut
if
she
had
not
from
time
to
time
passed
her
tongue
quickly
over
her
full
pale
lips
she
would
have
looked
like
a
dead
thing
the
coquettish
angle
at
which
her
little
black
hat
was
set
on
her
head
seemed
absurdly
inappropriate
to
the
occasion
and
her
mood
it
suggested
a
hat
being
worn
at
some
festival
her
black
gloved
hands
were
tightly
twisted
together
in
her
lap
and
she
allowed
her
plump
body
to
wag
quite
loosely
with
the
motion
of
the
carriage
making
no
attempt
at
resistance
she
had
really
the
appearance
of
a
corpse
sitting
up
the
tarpaulin
flapped
monotonously
the
coachman
cried
out
in
the
dimness
to
his
horses
like
a
bird
prolonging
his
call
drearily
and
then
violently
cracking
his
whip
domini
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
loose
tarpaulin
so
that
she
might
not
miss
one
of
the
wet
visions
it
discovered
by
its
reiterated
movement
she
had
not
slept
at
all
and
felt
as
if
there
was
a
gritty
dryness
close
behind
her
eyes
she
also
felt
very
alert
and
enduring
but
not
in
the
least
natural
had
some
extraordinary
event
occurred
had
the
carriage
for
instance
rolled
over
the
edge
of
the
road
into
the
sea
she
was
convinced
that
she
could
not
have
managed
to
be
either
surprised
or
alarmed
if
anyone
had
asked
her
whether
she
was
tired
she
would
certainly
have
answered
like
her
mother
domini
was
of
a
gipsy
type
she
stood
five
feet
ten
had
thick
almost
coarse
and
wavy
black
hair
that
was
parted
in
the
middle
of
her
small
head
dark
eyes
and
a
clear
skin
unflecked
with
colour
she
never
flushed
under
the
influence
of
excitement
or
emotion
her
forehead
was
broad
and
low
her
eyebrows
were
long
and
level
thicker
than
most
women
s
the
shape
of
her
face
was
oval
with
a
straight
short
nose
a
short
but
rather
prominent
and
round
chin
and
a
very
expressive
mouth
not
very
small
slightly
depressed
at
the
corners
with
perfect
teeth
and
red
lips
that
were
unusually
flexible
her
figure
was
remarkably
athletic
with
shoulders
that
were
broad
in
a
woman
and
a
naturally
small
waist
her
hands
and
feet
were
also
small
she
walked
splendidly
like
a
syrian
but
without
his
defiant
insolence
in
her
face
when
it
was
in
repose
there
was
usually
an
expression
of
still
indifference
some
thought
of
opposition
she
looked
her
age
and
had
never
used
a
powderpuff
in
her
life
she
could
smile
easily
and
easily
become
animated
and
in
her
animation
there
was
often
fire
as
in
her
calmness
there
was
sometimes
cloud
timid
people
were
generally
disconcerted
by
her
appearance
and
her
manner
did
not
always
reassure
them
her
obvious
physical
strength
had
something
surprising
in
it
and
woke
wonder
as
to
how
it
had
been
or
might
be
used
even
when
her
eyes
were
shut
she
looked
singularly
wakeful
domini
and
suzanne
got
to
the
station
of
robertville
much
too
early
the
large
hall
in
which
they
had
to
wait
was
miserably
lit
blank
and
decidedly
cold
the
was
on
the
left
and
the
room
was
divided
into
two
parts
by
a
broad
low
counter
on
which
the
heavy
luggage
was
placed
before
being
weighed
by
two
unshaven
and
hulking
men
in
blue
smocks
three
or
four
arab
touts
in
excessively
shabby
european
clothes
and
turbans
surrounded
domini
with
offers
of
assistance
one
the
dirtiest
of
the
group
with
a
gaping
in
which
there
was
no
eye
succeeded
by
his
passionate
volubility
and
impudence
in
attaching
himself
to
her
in
a
sort
of
official
capacity
he
spoke
fluent
but
faulty
french
which
attracted
suzanne
and
being
abnormally
muscular
and
active
in
an
amazingly
short
time
got
hold
of
all
their
boxes
and
bags
and
ranged
them
on
the
counter
he
then
indulged
in
a
dramatic
performance
which
he
apparently
considered
likely
to
rouse
into
life
and
attention
the
two
unshaven
men
in
smocks
who
were
smoking
cigarettes
and
staring
vaguely
at
the
metal
sheet
on
which
the
luggage
was
placed
to
be
weighed
suzanne
remained
expectantly
in
attendance
and
domini
having
nothing
to
do
and
seeing
no
bench
to
rest
on
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
hall
near
the
entrance
it
was
now
four
in
the
morning
and
in
the
air
domini
fancied
that
she
felt
the
cold
breath
of
the
coming
dawn
beyond
the
opening
of
the
station
as
she
passed
and
repassed
in
her
slow
and
aimless
walk
she
saw
the
soaking
tarpaulin
curtains
of
the
carriage
she
had
just
left
glistening
in
the
faint
after
a
few
minutes
the
arabs
she
had
noticed
on
the
road
entered
their
brown
slipperless
feet
were
caked
with
sticky
mud
and
directly
they
found
themselves
under
shelter
in
a
dry
place
they
dropped
the
robes
they
had
been
holding
up
and
bending
down
began
to
flick
it
off
on
to
the
floor
with
their
delicate
fingers
they
did
this
with
extraordinary
care
and
precision
rubbed
the
soles
of
their
feet
repeatedly
against
the
boards
and
then
put
on
their
yellow
slippers
and
threw
back
the
hoods
which
had
been
drawn
over
their
heads
a
few
french
passengers
straggled
in
yawning
and
looking
irritable
the
touts
surrounded
them
with
noisy
offers
of
assistance
the
men
in
smocks
still
continued
to
smoke
and
to
stare
at
the
metal
sheet
on
the
floor
although
the
luggage
now
extended
in
quite
a
long
line
upon
the
counter
they
paid
no
attention
to
it
or
to
the
violent
and
reiterated
cries
of
the
arabs
who
stood
behind
it
anxious
to
earn
a
tip
by
getting
it
weighed
and
registered
quickly
apparently
they
were
wrapped
in
savage
dreams
at
length
a
light
shone
through
the
small
opening
of
the
the
men
in
smocks
stirred
and
threw
down
their
cigarette
stumps
and
the
few
travellers
pressed
forward
against
the
counter
and
pointed
to
their
boxes
with
their
sticks
and
hands
suzanne
charpot
assumed
an
expression
of
attentive
suspicion
and
domini
ceased
from
walking
up
and
down
several
of
the
recruits
came
in
hastily
accompanied
by
two
zouaves
they
were
wet
and
looked
dazed
and
tired
out
grasping
their
bags
and
bundles
they
went
towards
the
platform
a
train
glided
slowly
in
gleaming
faintly
with
lights
domini
s
trunks
were
slammed
down
on
the
weighing
machine
and
suzanne
drawing
out
her
purse
took
her
stand
before
the
shining
hole
of
the
in
the
wet
darkness
there
rose
up
a
sound
like
a
child
calling
out
an
insulting
remark
this
was
followed
immediately
by
the
piping
of
a
horn
with
a
jerk
the
train
started
passed
one
by
one
the
station
lamps
and
with
a
steady
jangling
and
rattling
drew
out
into
the
shrouded
country
domini
was
in
a
carriage
with
three
frenchmen
facing
the
door
which
opened
on
to
the
platform
the
man
opposite
to
her
was
enormously
fat
with
a
beard
growing
up
to
his
eyes
he
wore
black
gloves
and
trousers
a
huge
black
cloth
hat
and
a
thick
black
cloak
with
a
black
buckle
near
the
throat
his
eyes
were
shut
and
his
large
heavy
head
drooped
forward
domini
wondered
if
he
was
travelling
to
the
funeral
of
some
relative
the
two
other
men
one
of
whom
looked
like
a
commercial
traveller
kept
shifting
their
feet
upon
the
tins
that
lay
on
the
floor
clearing
their
throats
and
sighing
loudly
one
of
them
coughed
let
down
the
window
spat
drew
the
window
up
sat
sideways
put
his
legs
suddenly
up
on
the
seat
and
groaned
the
train
rattled
more
harshly
and
shook
from
side
to
side
as
it
got
up
speed
rain
streamed
down
the
through
which
it
was
impossible
to
see
anything
domini
still
felt
alert
but
an
overpowering
sensation
of
dreariness
had
come
to
her
she
did
not
attribute
this
sensation
to
fatigue
she
did
not
try
to
analyse
it
she
only
felt
as
if
she
had
never
seen
or
heard
anything
that
was
not
cheerless
as
if
she
had
never
known
anything
that
was
not
either
sad
or
odd
or
inexplicable
what
did
she
remember
a
train
of
trifles
that
seemed
to
have
been
enough
to
fill
all
her
life
the
arrival
of
the
nervous
and
recruits
at
the
wharf
their
embarkation
their
last
staring
and
pathetic
look
at
france
the
stormy
voyage
the
sordid
illness
of
almost
everyone
on
board
the
approach
long
after
sundown
to
the
small
and
unknown
town
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
see
anything
clearly
the
marshalling
of
the
recruits
pale
with
sickness
their
pitiful
attempt
at
cheerful
singing
angrily
checked
by
the
zouaves
in
charge
of
them
their
departure
up
the
hill
carrying
their
poor
belongings
the
sleepless
night
the
sound
of
the
rain
falling
the
scents
rising
from
the
unseen
earth
the
tap
of
the
italian
waiter
at
the
door
the
damp
drive
to
the
station
the
long
wait
there
the
sneering
signal
followed
by
the
piping
horn
the
jerking
and
rattling
of
the
carriage
the
dim
light
within
it
falling
upon
the
stout
frenchman
in
his
mourning
the
streaming
water
upon
the
these
few
sights
sounds
sensations
were
like
the
story
of
a
life
to
domini
just
then
were
more
were
like
the
whole
of
life
always
dull
noise
strange
flitting
pale
faces
and
an
unknown
region
that
remained
perpeturally
invisible
and
that
must
surely
be
ugly
or
terrible
the
train
stopped
frequently
at
lonely
little
stations
domini
looked
out
letting
down
the
window
for
a
moment
at
each
station
she
saw
a
tiny
house
with
a
peaked
roof
a
wooden
railing
dividing
the
platform
from
the
country
road
mud
grass
bending
beneath
the
weight
of
and
tall
dripping
shaggy
eucalyptus
trees
sometimes
the
s
children
peered
at
the
train
with
curious
eyes
and
arabs
carefully
wrapped
up
their
mouths
and
chins
covered
by
folds
of
linen
got
in
and
out
slowly
once
domini
saw
two
women
in
thin
floating
white
dresses
and
spangled
veils
hurrying
by
like
ghosts
in
the
dark
heavy
silver
ornaments
jangled
on
their
ankles
above
their
black
slippers
splashed
with
mud
their
sombre
eyes
stared
out
from
circles
of
kohl
and
with
stained
hands
whose
nails
were
bright
red
they
clasped
their
light
and
bridal
raiment
to
their
prominent
breasts
they
were
escorted
by
a
gigantic
man
almost
black
with
a
zigzag
scar
across
the
left
side
of
his
face
who
wore
a
shining
brown
burnous
over
a
grey
woollen
jacket
he
pushed
the
two
women
into
the
train
as
if
he
were
pushing
bales
and
got
in
after
them
showing
enormous
bare
legs
with
calves
that
stuck
out
like
lumps
of
iron
the
darkness
began
to
fade
and
presently
as
the
grey
light
grew
slowly
stronger
the
rain
ceased
and
it
was
possible
to
see
through
the
glass
of
the
carriage
window
the
country
began
to
discover
itself
as
if
timidly
to
domini
s
eyes
she
had
recently
noticed
that
the
train
was
going
very
slowly
and
she
could
now
see
why
they
were
mounting
a
steep
incline
the
rich
damp
earth
of
the
plains
beyond
robertville
with
its
rank
grass
its
moist
ploughland
and
groves
of
eucalyptus
was
already
left
behind
the
train
was
crawling
in
a
cup
of
the
hills
grey
sterile
and
abandoned
without
roads
or
houses
without
a
single
tree
small
bushes
flourished
here
and
there
on
tiny
humps
of
earth
but
they
seemed
rather
to
emphasise
than
to
diminish
the
aspect
of
poverty
presented
by
the
soil
over
which
the
dawn
rising
from
the
wet
arms
of
night
shed
a
cold
and
reticent
illumination
by
a
gash
in
the
rounded
hills
where
the
earth
was
brownish
yellow
a
flock
of
goats
with
flapping
ears
tripped
slowly
followed
by
two
arab
boys
in
rags
one
of
the
boys
was
playing
upon
a
pipe
coverd
with
red
arabesques
domini
heard
two
or
three
bars
of
the
melody
they
were
ineffably
wild
and
very
clear
and
sweet
they
seemed
to
her
to
match
exactly
the
pure
and
ascetic
light
cast
by
the
dawn
over
these
bare
grey
hills
and
they
stirred
her
abruptly
from
the
depressed
lassitude
in
which
the
dreary
chances
of
recent
travel
had
drowned
her
she
began
with
a
certain
faint
excitement
to
realise
that
these
low
hills
were
africa
that
she
was
leaving
behind
the
sea
so
many
of
whose
waves
swept
along
european
shores
that
somewhere
beyond
the
broken
and
near
horizon
line
toward
which
the
train
was
creeping
lay
the
great
desert
her
destination
with
its
pale
sands
and
desolate
cities
its
sunburnt
tribes
of
workers
its
robbers
warriors
and
priests
its
ethereal
mysteries
of
mirage
its
tragic
splendours
of
colour
of
tempest
and
of
heat
a
sense
of
a
wider
world
than
the
compressed
world
into
which
physical
fatigue
had
decoyed
her
woke
in
her
brain
and
heart
the
little
arab
playing
carelessly
upon
his
pipe
with
the
red
arabesques
was
soon
invisible
among
his
goats
beside
the
dry
that
was
probably
the
limit
of
his
journeying
but
domini
felt
that
like
a
musician
at
the
head
of
a
procession
he
had
played
her
bravely
forward
into
the
dawn
and
africa
at
domini
changed
into
another
train
and
had
the
carriage
to
herself
the
recruits
had
reached
their
destination
hers
was
a
longer
pilgramage
and
still
towards
the
sun
she
could
not
afterwards
remember
what
she
thought
about
during
this
part
of
her
journey
subsequent
events
so
coloured
all
her
memories
of
africa
that
every
fold
of
its
soil
was
endowed
in
her
mind
with
the
significance
of
a
living
thing
every
palm
beside
a
well
every
stunted
vine
and
clambering
flower
upon
an
wall
every
form
of
hill
and
silhouette
of
shadow
became
in
her
heart
intense
with
the
beauty
and
the
pathos
she
used
as
a
child
to
think
must
lie
beyond
the
sunset
and
so
she
forgot
a
strange
sense
of
leaving
all
things
behind
had
stolen
over
her
she
was
really
fatigued
by
travel
and
by
want
of
sleep
but
she
did
not
know
it
lying
back
in
her
seat
with
her
head
against
the
dirty
white
covering
of
the
shaking
carriage
she
watched
the
great
change
that
was
coming
over
the
land
it
seemed
as
if
god
were
putting
forth
his
hand
to
withdraw
gradually
all
things
of
his
creation
all
the
furniture
he
had
put
into
the
great
palace
of
the
world
as
if
he
meant
to
leave
it
empty
and
utterly
naked
so
domini
thought
first
he
took
the
rich
and
shaggy
grass
and
all
the
little
flowers
that
bloomed
modestly
in
it
then
he
drew
away
the
orange
groves
the
oleander
and
the
apricot
trees
the
faithful
eucalyptus
with
its
pale
stems
and
tressy
foliage
the
sweet
waters
that
fertilised
the
soil
making
it
soft
and
brown
where
the
plough
seamed
it
into
furrows
the
tufted
plants
and
giant
reeds
that
crowd
where
water
is
and
still
as
the
train
ran
on
his
gifts
were
fewer
at
last
even
the
palms
were
gone
and
the
barbary
fig
displayed
no
longer
among
the
crumbling
boulders
its
tortured
strength
and
the
pale
and
fantastic
evolutions
of
its
unnatural
foliage
stones
lay
everywhere
upon
the
pale
yellow
or
earth
crystals
glittered
in
the
sun
like
shallow
jewels
and
far
away
under
clouds
that
were
dark
and
feathery
appeared
hard
and
relentless
mountains
which
looked
as
if
they
were
made
of
iron
carved
into
horrible
and
jagged
shapes
where
they
fell
into
ravines
they
became
black
their
swelling
bosses
and
flanks
sharp
sometimes
as
the
spines
of
animals
were
steel
coloured
their
summits
were
purple
deepening
where
the
clouds
came
down
to
ebony
journeying
towards
these
terrible
fastnesses
were
caravans
on
which
domini
looked
with
a
heavy
and
lethargic
interest
many
kabyles
fairer
than
she
was
moved
slowly
on
foot
towards
their
rock
villages
over
the
withered
earth
they
went
towards
the
distant
mountains
and
the
clouds
the
sun
was
hidden
the
wind
continued
to
rise
sand
found
its
way
in
through
the
carriage
windows
the
mountains
as
domini
saw
them
more
clearly
looked
more
gloomy
more
unearthly
there
was
something
unnatural
in
their
hard
outlines
in
the
rigid
mystery
of
their
innumerable
clefts
that
all
these
people
should
be
journeying
towards
them
was
pathetic
and
grieved
the
imagination
the
wind
seemed
so
cold
now
the
sun
was
hidden
that
she
had
drawn
both
the
windows
up
and
thrown
a
rug
over
her
she
put
her
feet
up
on
the
opposite
seat
and
half
closed
her
eyes
but
she
still
turned
them
towards
the
glass
on
her
left
and
watched
it
seemed
to
her
quite
impossible
that
this
shaking
and
slowly
moving
train
had
any
destination
the
desolation
of
the
country
had
become
so
absolute
that
she
could
not
conceive
of
anything
but
still
greater
desolation
lying
beyond
she
had
no
feeling
that
she
was
merely
traversing
a
tract
of
sterility
her
sensation
was
that
she
had
passed
the
boundary
of
the
world
god
had
created
and
come
into
some
other
place
upon
which
he
had
never
looked
and
of
which
he
had
no
knowledge
abruptly
she
felt
as
if
her
father
had
entered
into
some
such
region
when
he
forced
his
way
out
of
his
religion
and
in
this
region
he
had
died
she
had
stood
on
the
verge
of
it
by
his
deathbed
now
she
was
in
it
there
were
no
arabs
journeying
now
no
tents
huddled
among
the
low
bushes
the
last
sign
of
vegetation
was
obliterated
the
earth
rose
and
fell
in
a
series
of
humps
and
depressions
interspersed
with
piles
of
rock
every
shade
of
yellow
and
of
brown
mingled
and
flowed
away
towards
the
foot
of
the
mountains
here
and
there
dry
showed
their
teeth
their
crumbling
banks
were
like
the
rind
of
an
orange
little
birds
the
hue
of
the
earth
with
tufted
crests
tripped
jauntily
among
the
stones
fluttered
for
a
few
yards
and
alighted
with
an
air
of
strained
alertness
as
if
their
minute
bodies
were
full
of
trembling
wires
they
were
the
only
living
things
domini
could
see
she
thought
again
of
her
father
in
some
such
region
as
this
his
soul
must
surely
be
wandering
far
away
from
god
she
let
down
the
glass
the
wind
was
really
cold
and
blowing
gustily
she
drank
it
in
as
if
she
were
tasting
a
new
wine
and
she
was
conscious
at
once
that
she
had
never
before
breathed
such
air
there
was
a
wonderful
a
startling
flavour
in
it
the
flavour
of
gigantic
spaces
and
of
rolling
leagues
of
emptiness
neither
among
mountains
nor
upon
the
sea
had
she
ever
found
an
atmosphere
so
fiercely
pure
clean
and
lively
with
unutterable
freedom
she
leaned
out
to
it
shutting
her
eyes
and
now
that
she
saw
nothing
her
palate
savoured
it
more
intensely
the
thought
of
her
father
fled
from
her
all
detailed
thoughts
all
the
minutia
of
the
mind
were
swept
away
she
was
bracing
herself
to
an
encounter
with
something
gigantic
something
unshackled
the
being
from
whose
lips
this
wonderful
breath
flowed
when
two
lovers
kiss
their
breath
mingles
and
if
they
really
love
each
is
conscious
that
in
the
breath
of
the
loved
one
is
the
loved
one
s
soul
coming
forth
from
the
temple
of
the
body
through
the
temple
door
as
domini
leaned
out
seeing
nothing
she
was
conscious
that
in
this
breath
she
drank
there
was
a
soul
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
the
soul
which
flames
in
the
centre
of
things
and
beyond
she
could
not
think
any
longer
of
her
father
as
an
outcast
because
he
had
abandoned
a
religion
for
all
religions
were
surely
here
marching
side
by
side
and
behind
them
background
to
them
there
was
something
far
greater
than
any
religion
was
it
snow
or
fire
was
it
the
lawlessness
of
that
which
has
made
laws
or
the
calm
of
that
which
has
brought
passion
into
being
greater
love
than
is
in
any
creed
or
greater
freedom
than
is
in
any
human
liberty
domini
only
felt
that
if
she
had
ever
been
a
slave
at
this
moment
she
would
have
died
of
joy
realising
the
boundless
freedom
that
circles
this
little
earth
thank
god
for
it
she
murmured
aloud
her
own
words
woke
her
to
a
consciousness
of
ordinary
things
or
made
her
sleep
to
the
eternal
she
closed
the
window
and
sat
down
a
little
later
the
sun
came
out
again
and
the
various
shades
of
yellow
and
of
orange
that
played
over
the
wrinkled
earth
deepened
and
glowed
domini
had
sunk
into
a
lethargy
so
complete
that
though
not
asleep
she
was
scarcely
aware
of
the
sun
she
was
dreaming
of
liberty
presently
the
train
slackened
and
stopped
she
heard
a
loud
chattering
of
many
voices
and
looked
out
the
sun
was
now
shining
brilliantly
and
she
saw
a
station
crowded
with
arabs
in
white
burnouses
who
were
vociferously
greeting
friends
in
the
train
were
offering
enormous
oranges
for
sale
to
the
passengers
or
were
walking
up
and
down
gazing
curiously
into
the
carriages
with
the
unblinking
determination
and
indifference
to
a
return
of
scrutiny
which
she
had
already
noticed
and
thought
animal
a
guard
came
up
told
her
the
place
was
and
that
the
train
would
stay
there
ten
minutes
to
wait
for
the
train
from
she
decided
to
get
out
and
stretch
her
cramped
limbs
on
the
platform
she
found
suzanne
looking
like
a
person
who
had
just
been
slapped
one
side
of
the
maid
s
face
was
flushed
and
covered
with
a
faint
tracery
of
tiny
lines
the
other
was
greyish
white
sleep
hung
in
her
eyes
over
which
the
lids
drooped
as
if
they
were
partially
paralysed
her
fingers
were
yellow
from
peeling
an
orange
and
her
smart
little
hat
was
cocked
on
one
side
there
were
grains
of
sand
on
her
black
gown
and
when
she
saw
her
mistress
she
at
once
began
to
compress
her
lips
and
to
assume
the
expression
of
obstinate
patience
characteristic
of
servants
who
find
themselves
travelling
far
from
home
in
outlandish
places
have
you
been
asleep
suzanne
no
mam
you
ve
had
an
orange
i
couldn
t
get
it
down
mam
would
you
like
to
see
if
you
can
get
a
cup
of
coffee
here
no
thank
you
mam
zelle
i
couldn
t
touch
this
arab
we
shall
soon
be
there
suzanne
made
all
her
naturally
small
features
look
much
smaller
glanced
down
at
her
skirt
and
suddenly
began
to
shake
the
grains
of
sand
from
it
in
an
outraged
manner
at
the
same
time
extending
her
left
foot
two
or
three
young
arabs
came
up
and
stood
staring
round
her
their
eyes
were
magnificent
and
gravely
observant
suzanne
went
on
shaking
and
patting
her
skirt
and
domini
walked
away
down
the
platform
wondering
what
a
french
maid
s
mind
was
like
suzanne
s
certainly
had
its
limitations
it
was
evident
that
she
was
horrified
by
the
sight
of
bare
legs
why
as
domini
walked
along
the
platform
among
the
the
guides
the
turbaned
porters
with
their
badges
the
staring
children
and
the
ragged
wanderers
who
thronged
about
the
train
she
thought
of
the
desert
to
which
she
was
now
so
near
it
lay
she
knew
beyond
the
terrific
wall
of
rock
that
faced
her
but
she
could
see
no
opening
the
towering
summits
of
the
cliffs
jagged
as
the
teeth
of
a
wolf
broke
crudely
upon
the
serene
purity
of
the
sky
somewhere
concealed
in
the
darkness
of
the
gorge
at
their
feet
was
the
mouth
from
which
had
poured
forth
that
wonderful
breath
quivering
with
freedom
and
with
unearthly
things
the
sun
was
already
declining
and
the
light
it
cast
becoming
softened
and
romantic
soon
there
would
be
evening
in
the
desert
then
there
would
be
night
and
she
would
be
there
in
the
night
with
all
things
that
the
desert
holds
a
train
of
camels
was
passing
on
the
white
road
that
descended
into
the
shadow
of
the
gorge
some
men
accompanied
them
crying
continually
oosh
oosh
they
disappeared
with
their
bound
no
doubt
on
some
tremendous
journey
through
the
regions
of
the
sun
where
would
they
at
last
unlade
the
groaning
camels
domini
saw
them
in
the
midst
of
dunes
red
with
the
dying
fires
of
the
west
and
their
shadows
lay
along
the
sands
like
weary
things
reposing
she
started
when
a
low
voice
spoke
to
her
in
french
and
turning
round
saw
a
tall
arab
boy
magnificently
dressed
in
pale
blue
cloth
trousers
a
zouave
jacket
braided
with
gold
and
a
fez
standing
near
her
she
was
struck
by
the
colour
of
his
skin
which
was
faint
as
the
colour
of
au
and
by
the
contrast
between
his
huge
bulk
and
his
languid
almost
effeminate
demeanour
as
she
turned
he
smiled
at
her
calmly
and
lifted
one
hand
toward
the
wall
of
rock
madame
has
seen
the
desert
he
asked
never
answered
domini
it
is
the
garden
of
oblivion
he
said
still
in
a
low
voice
and
speaking
with
a
delicate
refinement
that
was
almost
mincing
in
the
desert
one
forgets
everything
even
the
little
heart
one
loves
and
the
desire
of
one
s
own
how
can
that
be
asked
domini
it
is
the
will
of
god
one
remembers
nothing
any
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
gigantic
pinnacles
of
the
rocks
there
was
something
fanatical
and
highly
imaginative
in
their
gaze
what
is
your
name
domini
asked
batouch
madame
you
are
going
to
yes
i
too
under
the
mimosa
trees
i
shall
compose
a
poem
it
will
be
addressed
to
irena
the
she
is
like
the
little
moon
when
it
first
comes
up
above
the
palm
just
then
the
train
from
ran
into
the
station
and
domini
turned
to
seek
her
carriage
as
she
was
coming
to
it
she
noticed
with
the
pang
of
the
selfish
traveller
who
wishes
to
be
undisturbed
that
a
tall
man
attended
by
an
arab
porter
holding
a
green
bag
was
at
the
door
of
it
and
was
evidently
about
to
get
in
he
glanced
round
as
domini
came
up
half
drew
back
rather
awkwardly
as
if
to
allow
her
to
precede
him
then
suddenly
sprang
in
before
her
the
arab
lifted
in
the
bag
and
the
man
endeavouring
hastily
to
thrust
some
money
into
his
hand
dropped
the
coin
which
fell
down
between
the
step
of
the
carriage
and
the
platform
the
arab
immediately
made
a
greedy
dive
after
it
interposing
his
body
between
domini
and
the
train
and
she
was
obliged
to
stand
waiting
while
he
looked
for
it
grubbing
frantically
in
the
earth
with
his
brown
fingers
and
uttering
muffled
exclamations
apparently
of
rage
meanwhile
the
tall
man
had
put
the
green
bag
up
on
the
rack
gone
quickly
to
the
far
side
of
the
carriage
and
sat
down
looking
out
of
the
window
domini
was
struck
by
the
mixture
of
indecision
and
blundering
haste
which
he
had
shown
and
by
his
impoliteness
evidently
he
was
not
a
gentleman
she
thought
or
he
would
surely
have
obeyed
his
first
impulse
and
allowed
her
to
get
into
the
train
before
him
it
seemed
too
as
if
he
were
determined
to
be
discourteous
for
he
sat
with
his
shoulder
deliberately
turned
towards
the
door
and
made
no
attempt
to
get
his
arab
out
of
the
way
although
the
train
was
just
about
to
start
domini
was
very
tired
and
she
began
to
feel
angry
with
him
contemptuous
too
the
arab
could
not
find
the
money
and
the
little
horn
now
piped
its
warning
of
departure
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
her
to
get
in
at
once
if
she
did
not
mean
to
stay
at
she
tried
to
pass
the
grovelling
arab
but
as
she
did
so
he
suddenly
sprang
up
jumped
on
to
the
step
of
the
carriage
and
thrusting
his
body
half
through
the
doorway
began
to
address
a
torrent
of
arabic
to
the
passenger
within
the
horn
sounded
again
and
the
carriage
jerked
backwards
preparatory
to
starting
on
its
way
to
domini
caught
hold
of
the
short
european
jacket
the
arab
was
wearing
and
said
in
french
you
must
let
me
get
in
at
once
the
train
is
the
man
however
intent
on
replacing
the
coin
he
had
lost
took
no
notice
of
her
but
went
on
vociferating
and
gesticulating
the
traveller
said
something
in
arabic
domini
was
now
very
angry
she
gripped
the
jacket
exerted
all
her
force
and
pulled
the
arab
violently
from
the
door
he
alighted
on
the
platform
beside
her
and
nearly
fell
before
he
had
recovered
himself
she
sprang
up
into
the
train
which
began
to
move
at
that
very
moment
as
she
got
in
the
man
who
had
caused
all
the
bother
was
leaning
forward
with
a
bit
of
silver
in
his
hand
looking
as
if
he
were
about
to
leave
his
seat
domini
cast
a
glance
of
contempt
at
him
and
he
turned
quickly
to
the
window
again
and
stared
out
at
the
same
time
putting
the
coin
back
into
his
pocket
a
dull
flush
rose
on
his
cheek
but
he
attempted
no
apology
and
did
not
even
offer
to
fasten
the
lower
handle
of
the
door
what
a
boor
domini
thought
as
she
bent
out
of
the
window
to
do
it
when
she
turned
from
the
door
after
securing
the
handle
she
found
the
carriage
full
of
a
pale
twilight
the
train
was
stealing
into
the
gorge
following
the
caravan
of
camels
which
she
had
seen
disappearing
she
paid
no
more
attention
to
her
companion
and
her
feeling
of
acute
irritation
against
him
died
away
for
the
moment
the
towering
cliffs
cast
mighty
shadows
the
darkness
deepened
the
train
quickening
its
speed
seemed
straining
forward
into
the
arms
of
night
there
was
a
chill
in
the
air
domini
drank
it
into
her
lungs
again
and
again
was
startled
stirred
by
the
life
and
the
mentality
of
it
she
was
conscious
of
receiving
it
with
passion
as
if
indeed
she
held
her
lips
to
a
mouth
and
drank
some
being
s
very
nature
into
hers
she
forgot
her
recent
vexation
and
the
man
who
had
caused
it
she
forgot
everything
in
mere
sensation
she
had
no
time
to
ask
whither
am
i
going
she
felt
like
one
borne
upon
a
wave
seaward
to
the
wonder
to
the
danger
perhaps
of
a
murmuring
unknown
the
rocks
leaned
forward
their
teeth
were
fastened
in
the
sky
they
enclosed
the
train
banishing
the
sun
and
the
world
from
all
the
lives
within
it
she
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
rushing
waters
far
beneath
her
of
crumbling
banks
covered
with
debris
like
the
banks
of
a
disused
quarry
of
shattered
boulders
grouped
in
a
wild
disorder
as
if
they
had
been
vomited
forth
from
some
underworld
or
cast
headlong
from
the
sky
of
the
flying
shapes
of
fruit
trees
mulberries
and
apricot
trees
oleanders
and
palms
of
dull
yellow
walls
guarding
pools
the
colour
of
absinthe
imperturbable
and
still
a
strong
impression
of
increasing
cold
and
darkness
grew
in
her
and
the
noises
of
the
train
became
hollow
and
seemed
to
be
expanding
as
if
they
were
striving
to
press
through
the
impending
rocks
and
find
an
outlet
into
space
failing
they
rose
angrily
violently
in
domini
s
ears
protesting
wrangling
shouting
declaiming
the
darkness
became
like
the
darkness
of
a
nightmare
all
the
trees
vanished
as
if
they
fled
in
fear
the
rocks
closed
in
as
if
to
crush
the
train
there
was
a
moment
in
which
domini
shut
her
eyes
like
one
expectant
of
a
tremendous
blow
that
can
not
be
avoided
she
opened
them
to
a
flood
of
gold
out
of
which
the
face
of
a
man
looked
like
a
face
looking
out
of
the
heart
of
the
sun
chapter
iii
it
flashed
upon
her
with
the
desert
with
the
burning
heaps
of
carnation
and
rocks
with
the
first
sand
wilderness
the
first
brown
villages
glowing
in
the
late
radiance
of
the
afternoon
like
carven
things
of
bronze
the
first
oasis
of
palms
deep
green
as
a
wave
of
the
sea
and
moving
like
a
wave
the
first
wonder
of
sahara
warmth
and
sahara
distance
she
passed
through
the
golden
door
into
the
blue
country
and
saw
this
face
and
for
a
moment
moved
by
the
exalted
sensation
of
a
magical
change
in
all
her
world
she
looked
at
it
simply
as
a
new
sight
presented
with
the
sun
the
mighty
rocks
the
hard
blind
villages
and
the
dense
trees
to
her
eyes
and
connected
it
with
nothing
it
was
part
of
this
strange
and
glorious
desert
region
to
her
that
was
all
for
a
moment
in
the
play
of
untempered
golden
light
the
face
seemed
pale
it
was
narrow
rather
long
with
marked
and
prominent
features
a
nose
with
a
high
bridge
a
mouth
with
straight
red
lips
and
a
powerful
chin
the
eyes
were
hazel
almost
yellow
with
curious
markings
of
a
darker
shade
in
the
yellow
dark
centres
that
looked
black
and
dark
outer
circles
the
eyelashes
were
very
long
the
eyebrows
thick
and
strongly
curved
the
forehead
was
high
and
swelled
out
slightly
above
the
temples
there
was
no
hair
on
the
face
which
was
closely
shaved
near
the
mouth
were
two
faint
lines
that
made
domini
think
of
physical
suffering
and
also
of
mediaeval
knights
despite
the
glory
of
the
sunshine
there
seemed
to
be
a
shadow
falling
across
the
face
this
was
all
that
domini
noticed
before
the
spell
of
change
and
the
abrupt
glory
was
broken
and
she
knew
that
she
was
staring
into
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
behaved
so
rudely
at
the
station
of
the
knowledge
gave
her
a
definite
shock
and
she
thought
that
her
expression
must
have
changed
abruptly
for
a
dull
flush
rose
on
the
stranger
s
thin
cheeks
and
mounted
to
his
rugged
forehead
he
glanced
out
of
the
window
and
moved
his
hands
uneasily
domini
noticed
that
they
scarcely
tallied
with
his
face
though
scrupulously
clean
they
looked
like
the
hands
of
a
labourer
hard
broad
and
brown
even
his
wrists
and
a
small
section
of
his
left
forearm
which
showed
as
he
lifted
his
left
hand
from
one
knee
to
the
other
were
heavily
tinted
by
the
sun
the
spaces
between
the
fingers
were
wide
as
they
usually
are
in
hands
accustomed
to
grasping
implements
but
the
fingers
themselves
were
rather
delicate
and
artistic
domini
observed
this
swiftly
then
she
saw
that
her
neighbour
was
unpleasantly
conscious
of
her
observation
this
vexed
her
vaguely
perhaps
because
even
so
trifling
a
circumstance
was
like
a
thin
link
between
them
she
snapped
it
by
ceasing
to
look
at
or
think
of
him
the
window
was
down
a
delicate
and
warm
breeze
drifted
in
coming
from
the
thickets
of
the
palms
in
flashing
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
gorge
domini
had
had
the
sensation
of
passing
into
a
new
world
and
a
new
atmosphere
the
sensation
stayed
with
her
now
that
she
was
no
longer
dreaming
or
giving
the
reins
to
her
imagination
but
was
calmly
herself
against
the
terrible
rampart
of
rock
the
winds
beat
across
the
land
of
the
tell
but
they
die
there
frustrated
and
the
rains
journey
thither
and
fail
sinking
into
the
pools
of
the
gorge
and
the
snows
and
even
the
clouds
stop
exhausted
in
their
pilgrimage
the
gorge
is
not
their
goal
but
it
is
their
grave
and
the
desert
never
sees
their
burial
so
domini
s
first
sense
of
casting
away
the
known
remained
and
even
grew
but
now
strongly
and
quietly
it
was
well
founded
she
thought
for
she
looked
out
of
the
carriage
window
towards
the
barrier
she
was
leaving
and
saw
that
on
this
side
guarding
the
desert
from
the
world
that
is
not
desert
it
was
pink
in
the
evening
light
deepening
here
and
there
to
rose
colour
whereas
on
the
far
side
it
had
a
rainy
hue
as
of
rocks
in
england
and
there
was
a
lustre
of
gold
in
the
hills
tints
of
glowing
bronze
slashed
with
a
red
line
as
the
heart
of
a
wound
but
recalling
the
heart
of
a
flower
the
folds
of
the
earth
glistened
there
was
flame
down
there
in
the
river
bed
the
wreckage
of
the
land
the
broken
fragments
gleamed
as
if
braided
with
precious
things
everywhere
the
salt
crystals
sparkled
with
the
violence
of
diamonds
everywhere
there
was
a
strength
of
colour
that
hurled
itself
to
the
gaze
unabashed
and
almost
savage
the
colour
of
summer
that
never
ceases
of
heat
that
seldom
dies
in
a
land
where
there
is
no
autumn
and
seldom
a
flitting
cold
down
on
the
road
near
the
village
there
were
people
old
men
playing
the
lady
s
game
with
stones
set
in
squares
of
sand
women
peeping
from
flat
roofs
and
doorways
children
driving
goats
a
man
like
a
fair
and
beautiful
christ
with
long
hair
and
a
curling
beard
beat
on
the
ground
with
a
staff
and
howled
some
tuneless
notes
he
was
dressed
in
red
and
green
no
one
heeded
him
a
distant
sound
of
the
beating
of
drums
rose
in
the
air
mingled
with
piercing
cries
uttered
by
a
nasal
voice
and
as
if
below
it
like
the
orchestral
accompaniment
of
a
dramatic
solo
hummed
many
blending
noises
faint
calls
of
labourers
in
the
and
of
women
at
the
wells
chatter
of
children
in
dusky
courts
sheltered
with
reeds
and
grasses
dim
pipings
of
shepherds
drowned
with
their
pattering
charges
in
the
golden
vapours
of
the
west
soft
twitterings
of
birds
beyond
brown
walls
in
green
seclusions
dull
barking
of
guard
dogs
mutter
of
camel
drivers
to
their
beasts
the
caravan
which
domini
had
seen
descending
into
the
gorge
reappeared
moving
deliberately
along
the
desert
road
towards
the
south
a
peeped
above
the
palms
doves
were
circling
round
it
many
of
them
were
white
they
flew
like
ivory
things
above
this
tower
of
glowing
bronze
which
slept
at
the
foot
of
the
pink
rocks
on
the
left
rose
a
mass
of
earth
and
stone
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
struck
it
and
it
glowed
mysteriously
like
a
mighty
jewel
as
domini
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
the
salt
crystals
sparkled
to
her
eyes
and
the
palms
swayed
languidly
above
the
waters
and
the
rose
and
mauve
of
the
hills
the
red
and
orange
of
the
earth
streamed
by
in
the
flames
of
the
sun
before
the
passing
train
like
a
barbaric
procession
to
the
sound
of
the
hidden
drums
the
cry
of
the
hidden
priest
and
all
the
whispering
melodies
of
these
strange
and
unknown
lives
tears
started
into
her
eyes
the
entrance
into
this
land
of
flame
and
colour
through
its
narrow
and
terrific
portal
stirred
her
almost
beyond
her
present
strength
the
glory
of
this
world
mounted
to
her
heart
oppressing
it
the
embrace
of
nature
was
so
violent
that
it
crushed
her
she
felt
like
a
little
fly
that
had
sought
to
wing
its
way
to
the
sun
and
at
a
million
miles
distance
from
it
was
being
shrivelled
by
its
heat
when
all
the
voices
of
the
village
fainted
away
she
was
glad
although
she
strained
her
ears
to
hear
their
fading
echoes
suddenly
she
knew
that
she
was
very
tired
so
tired
that
emotions
acted
upon
her
as
physical
exertion
acts
upon
an
exhausted
man
she
sat
down
and
shut
her
eyes
for
a
long
time
she
stayed
with
her
eyes
shut
but
she
knew
that
on
the
windows
strange
lights
were
glittering
that
the
carriage
was
slowly
filling
with
the
ineffable
splendours
of
the
west
long
afterwards
she
often
wondered
whether
she
endowed
the
sunset
of
that
day
with
supernatural
glories
because
she
was
so
tired
perhaps
the
salt
mountain
of
did
not
really
sparkle
like
the
celestial
mountains
in
the
visions
of
the
saints
perhaps
the
long
chain
of
the
aures
did
not
really
look
as
if
all
its
narrow
clefts
had
been
powdered
with
the
soft
and
bloomy
leaves
of
unearthly
violets
and
the
desert
was
not
cloudy
in
the
distance
towards
the
zibans
with
the
magical
blue
she
thought
she
saw
there
a
blue
neither
of
sky
nor
sea
but
like
the
hue
at
the
edge
of
a
flame
in
the
heart
of
a
wood
fire
she
often
wondered
but
she
never
knew
the
sound
of
a
movement
made
her
look
up
her
companion
was
changing
his
place
and
going
to
the
other
side
of
the
compartment
he
walked
softly
no
doubt
with
the
desire
not
to
disturb
domini
his
back
was
towards
her
for
an
instant
and
she
noticed
that
he
was
a
powerful
man
though
very
thin
and
that
his
gait
was
heavy
it
made
her
think
again
of
his
labourer
s
hands
and
she
began
to
wonder
idly
what
was
his
rank
and
what
he
did
he
sat
down
in
the
far
corner
on
the
same
side
as
herself
and
stared
out
of
his
window
crossing
his
legs
he
wore
large
boots
with
square
toes
clumsy
and
unfashionable
but
comfortable
and
good
for
walking
in
his
clothes
had
obviously
been
made
by
a
french
tailor
the
stuff
of
them
was
grey
and
woolly
and
they
were
cut
tighter
to
the
figure
than
english
clothes
generally
are
he
had
on
a
black
silk
necktie
and
a
soft
brown
travelling
hat
dented
in
the
middle
by
the
way
in
which
he
looked
out
of
the
window
domini
judged
that
he
too
was
seeing
the
desert
for
the
first
time
there
was
something
almost
passionately
attentive
in
his
attitude
something
of
strained
eagerness
in
that
part
of
his
face
which
she
could
see
from
where
she
was
sitting
his
cheek
was
not
pale
as
she
had
thought
at
first
but
brown
obviously
burnt
by
the
sun
of
africa
but
she
felt
that
underneath
the
sunburn
there
was
pallor
she
fancied
he
might
be
a
painter
and
was
noting
all
the
extraordinary
colour
effects
with
the
definiteness
of
a
man
who
meant
perhaps
to
reproduce
them
on
canvas
the
light
which
had
now
the
peculiar
almost
supernatural
softness
and
limpidity
of
light
falling
at
evening
from
a
declining
sun
in
a
hot
country
came
full
upon
him
and
brightened
his
hair
domini
saw
that
it
was
brown
with
some
chestnut
in
it
thick
and
cut
extremely
short
as
if
his
head
had
recently
been
shaved
she
felt
convinced
that
he
was
not
french
he
might
be
an
austrian
perhaps
or
a
russian
from
the
south
of
russia
he
remained
motionless
in
that
attitude
of
profound
observation
it
suggested
great
force
not
merely
of
body
but
also
of
mind
an
almost
abnormal
concentration
upon
the
thing
observed
this
was
a
man
who
could
surely
shut
out
the
whole
world
to
look
at
a
grain
of
sand
if
he
thought
it
beautiful
or
interesting
they
were
near
now
its
palms
appeared
far
off
and
in
the
midst
of
them
a
tower
the
sahara
lay
beyond
and
around
it
rolling
away
from
the
foot
of
low
brown
hills
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
covered
with
a
soft
powder
of
bronze
a
long
spur
of
mountains
stretched
away
towards
the
south
the
sun
was
very
near
his
setting
small
red
clouds
floated
in
the
western
quarter
of
the
sky
and
the
far
desert
was
becoming
mysteriously
dim
and
blue
like
a
remote
sea
here
and
there
thin
wreaths
of
smoke
ascended
from
it
and
lights
glittered
in
it
like
stars
domini
had
never
before
understood
how
strangely
how
strenuously
colour
can
at
moments
appeal
to
the
imagination
in
this
pageant
of
the
east
she
saw
arise
the
naked
soul
of
africa
no
faded
gentle
thing
fearful
of
being
seen
fearful
of
being
known
and
understood
but
a
phenomenon
vital
bold
and
gorgeous
like
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
pealing
a
great
as
she
looked
on
this
flaming
land
laid
fearlessly
bare
before
her
disdaining
the
clothing
of
grass
plant
and
flower
of
stream
and
tree
displaying
itself
with
an
almost
brazen
confident
in
its
spacious
power
and
in
its
golden
pride
her
heart
leaped
up
as
if
in
answer
to
a
deliberate
appeal
the
fatigue
in
her
died
she
responded
to
this
like
a
young
warrior
who
so
soon
as
he
is
wakened
stretches
out
his
hand
for
his
sword
the
sunset
flamed
on
her
clear
white
cheeks
giving
them
its
hue
of
life
and
her
nature
flamed
to
meet
it
in
the
huge
spaces
of
the
sahara
her
soul
seemed
to
hear
the
footsteps
of
freedom
treading
towards
the
south
and
all
her
dull
perplexities
all
her
bitterness
of
all
her
questionings
and
doubts
were
swept
away
on
the
keen
desert
wind
into
the
endless
plains
she
had
come
from
her
last
confession
asking
herself
what
am
i
she
had
felt
infinitely
small
confronted
with
the
pettiness
of
modern
civilised
life
in
a
narrow
crowded
world
now
she
did
not
torture
herself
with
any
questions
for
she
knew
that
something
large
something
capable
something
perhaps
even
noble
rose
up
within
her
to
greet
all
this
nobility
all
this
mighty
frankness
and
fierce
undressed
sincerity
of
nature
this
desert
and
this
sun
would
be
her
comrades
and
she
was
not
afraid
of
them
without
being
aware
of
it
she
breathed
out
a
great
sigh
feeling
the
necessity
of
liberating
her
joy
of
spirit
of
letting
the
body
however
inadequately
and
absurdly
make
some
demonstration
in
response
to
the
secret
stirring
of
the
soul
the
man
in
the
far
corner
of
the
carriage
turned
and
looked
at
her
when
she
heard
this
movement
domini
remembered
her
irritation
against
him
at
in
this
splendid
moment
the
feeling
seemed
to
her
so
paltry
and
contemptible
that
she
had
a
lively
impulse
to
make
amends
for
the
angry
look
she
had
cast
at
him
possibly
had
she
been
quite
normal
she
would
have
checked
such
an
impulse
the
voice
of
conventionality
would
have
made
itself
heard
but
domini
could
act
vigorously
and
quite
carelessly
when
she
was
moved
and
she
was
deeply
moved
now
and
longed
to
lavish
the
humanity
the
sympathy
and
ardour
that
were
quick
in
her
in
answer
to
the
stranger
s
movement
she
turned
towards
him
opening
her
lips
to
speak
to
him
afterwards
she
never
knew
what
she
meant
to
say
whether
if
she
had
spoken
the
words
would
have
been
french
or
english
for
she
did
not
speak
the
man
s
face
was
illuminated
by
the
setting
sun
as
he
sat
half
round
on
his
seat
leaning
with
his
right
hand
palm
downwards
on
the
cushions
the
light
glittered
on
his
short
hair
he
had
pushed
back
his
soft
hat
and
exposed
his
high
rugged
forehead
to
the
air
and
his
brown
left
hand
gripped
the
top
of
the
carriage
door
the
large
knotted
veins
on
it
the
stretched
sinews
were
very
perceptible
the
hand
looked
violent
domini
s
eyes
fell
on
it
as
she
turned
the
impulse
to
speak
began
to
fail
and
when
she
glanced
up
at
the
man
s
face
she
no
longer
felt
it
at
all
for
despite
the
glory
of
the
sunset
on
him
there
seemed
to
be
a
cold
shadow
in
his
eyes
the
faint
lines
near
his
mouth
looked
deeper
than
before
and
now
suggested
most
powerfully
the
dreariness
the
harshness
of
suffering
the
mouth
itself
was
compressed
and
grim
and
the
man
s
whole
expression
was
fierce
and
startling
as
the
expression
of
a
criminal
bracing
himself
to
endure
inevitable
detection
so
crude
and
piercing
indeed
was
this
mask
confronting
her
that
domini
started
and
was
inclined
to
shudder
for
a
minute
the
man
s
eyes
held
hers
and
she
thought
she
saw
in
them
unfathomable
depths
of
misery
or
of
wickedness
she
hardly
knew
which
sorrow
was
like
crime
and
crime
like
the
sheer
desolation
of
grief
to
her
just
then
and
she
thought
of
the
outer
darkness
spoken
of
in
the
bible
it
came
before
her
in
the
sunset
her
father
was
in
it
and
this
stranger
stood
by
him
the
thing
was
as
vital
and
fled
as
swiftly
as
a
hallucination
in
a
madman
s
brain
domini
looked
down
all
the
triumph
died
out
in
her
all
the
exquisite
consciousness
of
the
freedom
the
colour
the
bigness
of
life
for
there
was
a
black
spot
on
the
sun
humanity
god
s
mistake
in
the
great
plan
of
creation
and
the
shadow
cast
by
humanity
tempered
even
surely
conquered
the
light
she
wondered
whether
she
would
always
feel
the
cold
of
the
sunless
places
in
the
golden
dominion
of
the
sun
the
man
had
dropped
his
eyes
too
his
hand
fell
from
the
door
to
his
knee
he
did
not
move
till
the
train
ran
into
and
the
eager
faces
of
countless
arabs
stared
in
upon
them
from
the
scorched
field
of
manoeuvres
where
spahis
were
exercising
in
the
gathering
twilight
chapter

having
given
her
luggage
ticket
to
a
porter
domini
passed
out
of
the
station
followed
by
suzanne
who
looked
and
walked
like
an
exhausted
marionette
batouch
who
had
emerged
from
a
compartment
before
the
train
stopped
followed
them
closely
and
as
they
reached
the
jostling
crowd
of
arabs
which
swarmed
on
the
roadway
he
joined
them
with
the
air
of
a
proprietor
which
is
madame
s
hotel
domini
looked
round
ah
batouch
suzanne
jumped
as
if
her
string
had
been
sharply
pulled
and
cast
a
glance
of
dreary
suspicion
upon
the
poet
she
looked
at
his
legs
then
upwards
he
wore
white
socks
which
almost
met
his
pantaloons
scarcely
more
than
an
inch
of
pale
brown
skin
was
visible
the
gold
buttons
of
his
jacket
glittered
brightly
his
blue
robe
floated
majestically
from
his
broad
shoulders
and
the
large
tassel
of
his
fez
fell
coquettishly
towards
his
left
ear
above
which
was
set
a
pale
blue
flower
with
a
woolly
green
leaf
suzanne
was
slightly
reassured
by
the
flower
and
the
bright
buttons
she
felt
that
they
needed
a
protector
in
this
mob
of
shouting
brown
and
black
men
who
clamoured
about
them
like
savages
exposing
bare
legs
and
arms
even
bare
chests
in
a
most
barbarous
manner

minutes

suzanne
collapsed
her
bones
became
as
wax
with
apprehension
she
saw
herself
toiling
over
leagues
of
sand
towards
some
nameless
hovel
suzanne
you
can
get
into
the
omnibus
and
take
the
at
the
sweet
word
omnibus
a
ray
of
hope
stole
into
the
maid
s
heart
and
when
a
man
in
a
long
blue
coat
and
indubitable
trousers
assisted
her
politely
into
a
vehicle
which
was
unmistakable
she
almost
wept
for
joy
meanwhile
domini
escorted
serenely
by
the
poet
walked
towards
the
long
gardens
of
she
passed
over
a
wooden
bridge
white
dust
was
flying
from
the
road
along
which
many
of
the
arab
aristocracy
were
indolently
strolling
carrying
lightly
in
their
hands
small
red
roses
or
sprigs
of
pink
geranium
in
their
white
robes
they
looked
she
thought
like
monks
though
the
cigarettes
many
of
them
were
smoking
fought
against
the
illusion
some
of
them
were
dressed
like
batouch
in
cloth
they
held
each
other
s
hands
loosely
as
they
sauntered
along
chattering
in
soft
contralto
voices
two
or
three
were
attended
by
servants
who
walked
a
pace
or
two
behind
them
on
the
left
these
were
members
of
great
families
rulers
of
tribes
men
who
had
influence
over
the
sahara
people
one
a
shortish
man
with
a
beard
moved
so
majestically
that
he
seemed
almost
a
giant
his
face
was
very
pale
on
one
of
his
small
almost
white
hands
glittered
a
diamond
ring
a
boy
with
a
long
hooked
nose
strolled
gravely
near
him
wearing
brown
kid
gloves
and
a
turban
spangled
with
gold
that
is
the
kaid
of
tonga
madame
whispered
batouch
looking
at
the
pale
man
reverently
he
is
here
how
white
he
they
tried
to
poison
him
ever
since
he
is
ill
inside
that
is
his
brother
the
brown
gloves
are
very
a
light
carriage
rolled
rapidly
by
them
in
a
white
mist
of
dust
it
was
drawn
by
a
pair
of
white
mules
who
whisked
their
long
tails
as
they
trotted
briskly
urged
on
by
a
cracking
whip
a
big
boy
with
heavy
brown
eyes
was
the
coachman
by
his
side
sat
a
very
tall
young
negro
with
a
humorous
pointed
nose
dressed
in
primrose
yellow
he
grinned
at
batouch
out
of
the
mist
which
accentuated
the
hue
of
his
whimsical
happy
face
that
is
the
agha
s
son
with
they
turned
aside
from
the
road
and
came
into
a
long
tunnel
formed
by
mimosa
trees
that
met
above
a
broad
path
to
right
and
left
were
other
little
paths
branching
among
the
trunks
of
fruit
trees
and
the
narrow
twigs
of
many
bushes
that
grew
luxuriantly
between
sandy
brown
banks
carefully
flattened
and
beaten
hard
by
the
spades
of
arab
gardeners
glided
streams
of
opaque
water
that
were
guided
from
the
desert
by
a
system
of
dams
the
kaid
s
mill
watched
over
them
and
the
great
wall
of
the
fort
in
the
tunnel
the
light
was
very
delicate
and
tinged
with
green
the
noise
of
the
water
flowing
was
just
audible
a
few
arabs
were
sitting
on
benches
in
dreamy
attitudes
with
their
heelless
slippers
hanging
from
the
toes
of
their
bare
feet
beyond
the
entrance
of
the
tunnel
domini
could
see
two
horsemen
galloping
at
a
tremendous
pace
into
the
desert
their
red
cloaks
streamed
out
over
the
sloping
quarters
of
their
horses
which
devoured
the
earth
as
if
in
a
frenzy
of
emulation
they
disappeared
into
the
last
glories
of
the
sun
which
still
lingered
on
the
plain
and
blazed
among
the
summits
of
the
red
mountains
all
the
contrasts
of
this
land
were
exquisite
to
domini
and
in
some
mysterious
way
suggested
eternal
things
whispering
through
colour
gleam
and
shadow
through
the
pattern
of
leaf
and
rock
through
the
air
now
fresh
now
tenderly
warm
and
perfumed
through
the
silence
that
hung
like
a
filmy
cloud
in
the
golden
heaven
she
and
batouch
entered
the
tunnel
passing
at
once
into
definite
evening
the
quiet
of
these
gardens
was
delicious
and
was
only
interrupted
now
and
then
by
the
sound
of
wheels
upon
the
road
as
a
carriage
rolled
by
to
some
house
which
was
hidden
in
the
distance
of
the
oasis
the
seated
arabs
scarcely
disturbed
it
by
their
murmured
talk
many
of
them
indeed
said
nothing
but
rested
like
in
graceful
attitudes
with
hanging
hands
and
eyes
soft
as
the
eyes
of
gazelles
that
regarded
the
shadowy
paths
and
creeping
waters
with
a
grave
serenity
born
of
the
inmost
spirit
of
idleness
but
batouch
loved
to
talk
and
soon
began
a
languid
monologue
he
told
domini
that
he
had
been
in
paris
where
he
had
been
the
guest
of
a
french
poet
who
adored
the
east
that
he
himself
was
instructed
and
not
like
other
arabs
that
he
smoked
the
hashish
and
could
sing
the
love
songs
of
the
sahara
that
he
had
travelled
far
in
the
desert
to
souf
and
to
ouargla
beyond
the
ramparts
of
the
dunes
that
he
composed
verses
in
the
night
when
the
uninstructed
the
brawlers
the
drinkers
of
absinthe
and
the
domino
players
were
sleeping
or
wasting
their
time
in
the
darkness
over
the
pastimes
of
the
lewd
when
the
sybarites
were
sweating
under
the
smoky
arches
of
the
moorish
baths
and
the
of
the
sat
in
her
house
guarding
the
jewels
and
the
amulets
of
her
gay
confederation
these
verses
were
written
both
in
arabic
and
in
french
and
the
poet
of
paris
and
his
friends
had
found
them
beautiful
as
the
dawn
and
as
the
palm
trees
of
ourlana
by
the
artesian
wells
all
the
girls
of
the
ouled
nails
were
celebrated
in
these
poems
aishoush
and
irena
fatma
and
baali
in
them
also
were
enshrined
legends
of
the
venerable
marabouts
who
slept
in
the
paradise
of
allah
and
tales
of
the
great
warriors
who
had
fought
above
the
rocky
precipices
of
constantine
and
far
off
among
the
sands
of
the
south
they
told
the
stories
of
the
koulouglis
whose
mothers
were
moorish
slaves
and
romances
in
which
figured
the
beni
m
zab
and
the
freed
negroes
who
had
fled
away
from
the
lands
in
the
very
heart
of
the
sun
all
this
information
not
wholly
devoid
of
a
naive
egoism
batouch
poured
forth
gently
and
melodiously
as
they
walked
through
the
twilight
in
the
tunnel
and
domini
was
quite
content
to
listen
the
strange
names
the
poet
mentioned
his
liquid
pronunciation
of
them
his
allusions
to
wild
events
that
had
happened
long
ago
in
desert
places
and
to
the
lives
of
priests
of
his
old
religion
of
fanatics
and
girls
who
rode
on
camels
caparisoned
in
red
to
the
of
sahara
cities
all
these
things
cradled
her
humour
at
this
moment
and
seemed
to
plant
her
like
a
mimosa
tree
deep
down
in
this
sand
garden
of
the
sun
she
had
forgotten
her
bitter
sensation
in
the
railway
carriage
when
it
was
recalled
to
her
mind
by
an
incident
that
clashed
with
her
present
mood
steps
sounded
on
the
path
behind
them
going
faster
than
they
were
and
presently
domini
saw
her
striding
along
accompanied
by
a
young
arab
who
was
carrying
the
green
bag
the
stranger
was
looking
straight
before
him
down
the
tunnel
and
he
went
by
swiftly
but
his
guide
had
something
to
say
to
batouch
and
altered
his
pace
to
keep
beside
them
for
a
moment
he
was
a
very
thin
lithe
youth
apparently
about
years
old
with
a
skin
high
cheek
bones
long
eyes
twinkling
with
dissipated
humour
and
a
large
mouth
that
smiled
showing
pointed
white
teeth
a
straggling
black
moustache
sprouted
on
his
upper
lip
and
long
coarse
strands
of
hair
escaped
from
under
the
front
of
a
fez
that
was
pushed
back
on
his
small
head
his
neck
was
thin
and
long
and
his
hands
were
wonderfully
delicate
and
expressive
with
rosy
and
quite
perfect
nails
when
he
laughed
he
had
a
habit
of
throwing
his
head
forward
and
tucking
in
his
chin
letting
the
tassel
of
his
fez
fall
over
his
temple
to
left
or
right
he
was
dressed
in
white
with
a
burnous
and
had
a
piece
of
silk
with
frayed
edges
wound
about
his
waist
which
was
as
slim
as
a
young
girl
s
he
spoke
to
batouch
with
intense
vivacity
in
arabic
at
the
same
time
shooting
glances
wholly
and
even
preternaturally
keen
and
intelligent
at
domini
batouch
replied
with
the
dignified
languor
that
seemed
peculiar
to
him
the
colloquy
continued
for
two
or
three
minutes
domini
thought
it
sounded
like
a
quarrel
but
she
was
not
accustomed
to
arabs
talk
meanwhile
the
stranger
in
front
had
slackened
his
pace
and
was
obviously
lingering
for
his
neglectful
guide
once
or
twice
he
nearly
stopped
and
made
a
movement
as
if
to
turn
round
but
he
checked
it
and
went
on
slowly
his
guide
spoke
more
and
more
vehemently
and
suddenly
tucking
in
his
chin
and
displaying
his
rows
of
big
and
dazzling
teeth
burst
into
a
gay
and
boyish
laugh
at
the
same
time
shaking
his
head
rapidly
then
he
shot
one
last
sly
look
at
domini
and
hurried
on
airily
swinging
the
green
bag
to
and
fro
his
arms
had
tiny
bones
but
they
were
evidently
strong
and
he
walked
with
the
light
ease
of
a
young
animal
after
he
had
gone
he
turned
his
head
once
and
stared
full
at
domini
she
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
vanity
and
consciousness
of
his
expression
it
was
childish
yet
there
was
something
ruthless
and
wicked
in
it
too
as
he
came
up
to
the
stranger
the
latter
looked
round
said
something
to
him
and
then
hastened
forward
domini
was
struck
by
the
difference
between
their
gaits
for
the
stranger
although
he
was
so
strongly
built
and
muscular
walked
rather
heavily
and
awkwardly
with
a
peculiar
shuffling
motion
of
his
feet
she
began
to
wonder
how
old
he
was
about
or
she
thought
that
is
hadj
said
batouch
in
his
soft
rich
voice
hadj
yes
he
is
my
cousin
he
lives
in
but
he
too
has
been
in
paris
he
has
been
in
prison
what
for
batouch
gave
this
piece
of
information
with
quiet
indifference
and
continued
he
likes
to
laugh
he
is
lazy
he
has
earned
a
great
deal
of
money
and
now
he
has
none
he
is
very
gay
because
he
has
a
i
see
then
he
is
a
guide
many
people
in
are
guides
but
hadj
is
always
lucky
in
getting
the
that
man
with
him
isn
t
english
domini
exclaimed
she
had
wondered
what
the
traveller
s
nationality
was
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
it
might
be
the
same
as
her
own
yes
he
is
and
he
is
going
to
the
hotel
du
desert
you
and
he
are
the
only
english
here
and
almost
the
only
travellers
it
is
too
early
for
many
travellers
yet
they
fear
the
heat
and
besides
few
english
come
here
now
what
a
pity
they
spend
money
and
like
to
see
everything
hadj
is
very
anxious
to
buy
a
costume
at
tunis
for
the
great
at
the
end
of
ramadan
it
will
cost
fifty
or
sixty
francs
he
hopes
the
englishman
is
rich
but
all
the
english
are
rich
and
here
batouch
looked
steadily
at
domini
with
his
large
unconcerned
eyes
this
one
speaks
arabic
a
domini
made
no
reply
she
was
surprised
by
this
piece
of
information
there
was
something
she
thought
essentially
about
the
stranger
he
was
certainly
not
dressed
by
an
english
tailor
but
it
was
not
only
that
which
had
caused
her
mistake
his
whole
air
and
look
his
manner
of
holding
himself
of
sitting
of
walking
yes
especially
of
walking
were
surely
foreign
yet
when
she
came
to
think
about
it
she
could
not
say
that
they
were
characteristic
of
any
other
country
idly
she
had
said
to
herself
that
the
stranger
might
be
an
austrian
or
a
russian
but
she
had
been
thinking
of
his
colouring
it
happened
that
two
of
those
two
nations
whom
she
had
met
frequently
in
london
had
hair
of
that
shade
of
rather
warm
brown
he
does
not
look
like
an
englishman
she
said
presently
he
can
talk
in
french
and
in
arabic
but
hadj
says
he
is
how
should
hadj
know
because
he
has
the
eyes
of
the
jackal
and
has
been
with
many
english
we
are
getting
near
to
the
catholic
church
madame
you
will
see
it
through
the
trees
and
there
is
monsieur
the
cure
coming
towards
us
he
is
coming
from
his
house
which
is
near
the
at
some
distance
in
the
twilight
of
the
tunnel
domini
saw
a
black
figure
in
a
soutane
walking
very
slowly
towards
them
the
stranger
who
had
been
covering
the
ground
rapidly
with
his
curious
shuffling
stride
was
much
nearer
to
it
than
they
were
and
if
he
kept
on
at
his
present
pace
would
soon
pass
it
but
suddenly
domini
saw
him
pause
and
hesitate
he
bent
down
and
seemed
to
be
doing
something
to
his
boot
hadj
dropped
the
green
bag
and
was
evidently
about
to
kneel
down
and
assist
him
when
he
lifted
himself
up
abruptly
and
looked
before
him
as
if
at
the
priest
who
was
approaching
then
turned
sharply
to
the
right
into
a
path
which
led
out
of
the
garden
to
the
arcades
of
the
rue
berthe
hadj
followed
gesticulating
frantically
and
volubly
explaining
that
the
hotel
was
in
the
opposite
direction
but
the
stranger
did
not
stop
he
only
glanced
swiftly
back
over
his
shoulder
once
and
then
continued
on
his
way
what
a
funny
man
that
is
said
batouch
what
does
he
want
to
do
domini
did
not
answer
him
for
the
priest
was
just
passing
them
and
she
saw
the
church
to
the
left
among
the
trees
it
was
a
plain
unpretending
building
with
a
white
wooden
door
set
in
an
arch
above
the
arch
were
a
small
cross
two
windows
with
rounded
tops
a
clock
and
a
white
tower
with
a
pink
roof
she
looked
at
it
and
at
the
priest
whose
face
was
dark
and
meditative
with
lustrous
but
sad
brown
eyes
yet
she
thought
of
the
stranger
her
attention
was
beginning
to
be
strongly
fixed
upon
the
unknown
man
his
appearance
and
manner
were
so
unusual
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
notice
him
there
is
the
hotel
madame
said
batouch
domini
saw
it
standing
at
right
angles
to
the
church
facing
the
gardens
a
little
way
back
from
the
church
was
the
priest
s
house
a
white
building
shaded
by
date
palms
and
pepper
trees
as
they
drew
near
the
stranger
reappeared
under
the
arcade
above
which
was
the
terrace
of
the
hotel
he
vanished
through
the
big
doorway
followed
by
hadj
while
suzanne
was
unpacking
domini
came
out
on
to
the
broad
terrace
which
ran
along
the
whole
length
of
the
hotel
du
desert
her
bedroom
opened
on
to
it
in
front
and
at
the
back
communicated
with
a
small
salon
this
salon
opened
on
to
a
second
and
smaller
terrace
from
which
the
desert
could
be
seen
beyond
the
palms
there
seemed
to
be
no
guests
in
the
hotel
the
verandah
was
deserted
and
the
peace
of
the
soft
evening
was
profound
against
the
white
parapet
a
small
round
table
and
a
cane
armchair
had
been
placed
a
subdued
patter
of
feet
in
slippers
came
up
the
stairway
and
an
arab
servant
appeared
with
a
he
put
it
down
on
the
table
with
the
precise
deftness
which
domini
had
already
observed
in
the
arabs
at
robertville
and
swiftly
vanished
she
sat
down
in
the
chair
and
poured
out
the
tea
leaning
her
left
arm
on
the
parapet
her
head
was
very
tired
and
her
temples
felt
compressed
she
was
thankful
for
the
quiet
round
her
any
harsh
voice
would
have
been
intolerable
to
her
just
then
there
were
many
sounds
in
the
village
but
they
were
vague
and
mingled
flowing
together
and
composing
one
sound
that
was
soothing
the
restrained
and
level
voice
of
life
it
hummed
in
domini
s
ears
as
she
sipped
her
tea
and
gave
an
of
romance
to
the
peace
the
light
that
floated
in
under
the
round
arches
of
the
terrace
was
subdued
the
sun
had
just
gone
down
and
the
bright
colours
bloomed
no
more
upon
the
mountains
which
looked
like
silent
monsters
that
had
lost
the
hue
of
youth
and
had
suddenly
become
mysteriously
old
the
evening
star
shone
in
a
sky
that
still
held
on
its
western
border
some
last
pale
glimmerings
of
day
and
at
its
signal
many
dusky
wanderers
folded
their
loose
garments
round
them
slung
their
long
guns
across
their
shoulders
and
prepared
to
start
on
their
journey
helped
by
the
cool
night
wind
that
blows
in
the
desert
when
the
sun
departs
domini
did
not
know
of
them
but
she
felt
the
near
presence
of
the
desert
and
the
feeling
quieted
her
nerves
she
was
thankful
at
this
moment
that
she
was
travelling
without
any
woman
friend
and
was
not
persecuted
by
any
sense
of
obligation
in
her
fatigue
to
rest
passive
in
the
midst
of
quiet
and
soft
light
calm
in
the
belief
almost
the
certainty
that
this
desert
village
contained
no
acquaintance
to
disturb
her
was
to
know
all
the
joy
she
needed
for
the
moment
she
drank
it
in
dreamily
liberty
had
always
been
her
fetish
what
woman
had
more
liberty
than
she
had
here
on
this
lonely
verandah
with
the
shadowy
trees
below
the
bell
of
the
church
near
by
chimed
softly
and
the
familiar
sound
fell
strangely
upon
domini
s
ears
out
here
in
africa
reminding
her
of
many
sorrows
her
religion
was
linked
with
terrible
memories
with
cruel
struggles
with
hateful
scenes
of
violence
lord
rens
had
been
a
man
of
passionate
temperament
strong
in
goodness
when
he
had
been
led
by
love
he
had
been
equally
strong
in
evil
when
hate
had
led
him
domini
had
been
forced
to
contemplate
at
close
quarters
the
raw
character
of
a
warped
man
from
whom
circumstance
had
stripped
all
tenderness
nearly
all
reticence
the
terror
of
truth
was
known
to
her
she
had
shuddered
before
it
but
she
had
been
obliged
to
watch
it
during
many
years
in
coming
to
she
had
had
a
sort
of
vague
and
almost
childish
feeling
that
she
was
putting
the
broad
sea
between
herself
and
it
yet
before
she
had
started
it
had
been
buried
in
the
grave
she
never
wished
to
behold
such
truth
again
she
wanted
to
look
upon
some
other
truth
of
life
the
truth
of
beauty
of
calm
of
freedom
lord
rens
had
always
been
a
slave
the
slave
of
love
most
of
all
when
he
was
filled
with
hatred
and
domini
influenced
by
his
example
instinctively
connected
love
with
a
chain
only
the
love
a
human
being
has
for
god
seemed
to
her
sometimes
the
finest
freedom
the
movement
of
the
soul
upward
into
the
infinite
obedient
to
the
call
of
the
great
liberator
the
love
of
man
for
woman
of
woman
for
man
she
thought
of
as
imprisonment
bondage
was
not
her
mother
a
slave
to
the
man
who
had
wrecked
her
life
and
carried
her
spirit
beyond
the
chance
of
heaven
was
not
her
father
a
slave
to
her
mother
she
shrank
definitely
from
the
contemplation
of
herself
loving
with
all
the
strength
she
suspected
in
her
heart
a
human
being
in
her
religion
only
she
had
felt
in
rare
moments
something
of
love
and
now
here
in
this
tremendous
and
conquering
land
she
felt
a
divine
stirring
in
her
love
for
nature
for
that
afternoon
nature
so
often
calm
and
meditative
or
gently
indifferent
as
one
too
complete
to
be
aware
of
those
who
lack
completeness
had
impetuously
summoned
her
to
worship
had
ardently
appealed
to
her
for
something
more
than
a
temperate
watchfulness
or
a
sober
admiration
there
had
been
a
most
definite
demand
made
upon
her
even
in
her
fatigue
and
in
this
dreamy
twilight
she
was
conscious
of
a
latent
excitement
that
was
not
lulled
to
sleep
and
as
she
sat
there
while
the
darkness
grew
in
the
sky
and
spread
secretly
along
the
sandy
rills
among
the
trees
she
wondered
how
much
she
held
within
her
to
give
in
answer
to
this
cry
to
her
of
nature
was
it
only
a
little
she
did
not
know
perhaps
she
was
too
tired
to
know
but
however
much
it
was
it
must
seem
meagre
what
is
even
a
woman
s
heart
given
to
the
desert
or
a
woman
s
soul
to
the
sea
what
is
the
worship
of
anyone
to
the
sunset
among
the
hills
or
to
the
wind
that
lifts
all
the
clouds
from
before
the
face
of
the
moon
a
chill
stole
over
domini
she
felt
like
a
very
poor
woman
who
can
never
know
the
joy
of
giving
because
she
does
not
possess
even
a
mite
the
church
bell
chimed
again
among
the
palms
domini
heard
voices
quite
clearly
below
her
under
the
arcade
a
french
cafe
was
installed
there
and
two
or
three
soldiers
were
taking
their
before
dinner
out
in
the
air
they
were
talking
of
france
as
people
in
exile
talk
of
their
country
with
the
deliberateness
that
would
conceal
regret
and
the
child
s
instinctive
affection
for
the
mother
their
voices
made
domini
think
again
of
the
recruits
and
then
because
of
them
of
notre
dame
de
la
garde
the
mother
of
god
looking
towards
africa
she
remembered
the
tragedy
of
her
last
confession
would
she
be
able
to
confess
here
to
the
father
whom
she
had
seen
strolling
in
the
tunnel
would
she
learn
to
know
here
what
she
really
was
how
warm
it
was
in
the
night
and
how
warmth
as
it
develops
the
fecundity
of
the
earth
develops
also
the
possibilities
in
many
men
and
women
despite
her
lassitude
of
body
which
kept
her
motionless
as
an
idol
in
her
chair
with
her
arm
lying
along
the
parapet
of
the
verandah
domini
felt
as
if
a
confused
crowd
of
things
indefinable
but
violent
was
already
stirring
within
her
nature
as
if
this
new
climate
was
calling
armed
men
into
being
could
she
not
hear
the
murmur
of
their
voices
the
distant
clashing
of
their
weapons
without
being
aware
of
it
she
was
dropping
into
sleep
the
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
wooden
floor
of
the
verandah
recalled
her
it
was
at
some
distance
behind
her
it
crossed
the
verandah
and
stopped
she
felt
quite
certain
that
it
was
the
step
of
her
not
because
she
knew
he
was
staying
in
the
hotel
but
rather
because
of
the
curious
uneven
heaviness
of
the
tread
what
was
he
doing
looking
over
the
parapet
into
the
fruit
gardens
where
the
white
figures
of
the
arabs
were
flitting
through
the
trees
he
was
perfectly
silent
domini
was
now
wide
awake
the
feeling
of
calm
serenity
had
left
her
she
was
nervously
troubled
by
this
presence
near
her
and
swiftly
recalled
the
few
trifling
incidents
of
the
day
which
had
begun
to
delineate
a
character
for
her
they
were
she
found
all
unpleasant
all
at
least
faintly
disagreeable
yet
in
sum
what
was
their
meaning
the
sketch
they
traced
was
so
slight
so
confused
that
it
told
little
the
last
incident
was
the
strangest
and
again
she
saw
the
long
and
luminous
pathway
of
the
tunnel
flickering
with
light
and
shade
carpeted
with
the
pale
reflections
of
the
leaves
and
narrow
branches
of
the
trees
the
black
figure
of
the
priest
far
down
it
and
the
tall
form
of
the
stranger
in
an
attitude
of
painful
hesitation
each
time
she
had
seen
him
apparently
desirous
of
doing
something
definite
hesitation
had
overtaken
him
in
his
indecision
there
was
something
horrible
to
her
something
alarming
she
wished
he
was
not
standing
behind
her
and
her
discomfort
increased
she
could
still
hear
the
voices
of
the
soldiers
in
the
cafe
perhaps
he
was
listening
to
them
they
sounded
louder
the
speakers
were
getting
up
from
their
seats
there
was
a
jingling
of
spurs
a
tramp
of
feet
and
the
voices
died
away
the
church
bell
chimed
again
as
it
did
so
domini
heard
heavy
and
uneven
steps
cross
the
verandah
hurriedly
an
instant
later
she
heard
a
window
shut
sharply
suzanne
she
called
her
maid
appeared
yawning
with
various
parcels
in
her
hands
yes
i
sha
n
t
go
down
to
the
tell
them
to
give
me
some
dinner
in
my
yes
you
did
not
see
who
was
on
the
verandah
just
now
the
maid
looked
surprised
i
was
in
mademoiselle
s
yes
how
near
the
church
mademoiselle
will
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
to
mass
she
will
not
be
obliged
to
go
among
all
the
domini
smiled
i
have
come
here
to
be
among
the
arabs
the
porter
of
the
omnibus
tells
me
they
are
dirty
and
very
dangerous
they
carry
knives
and
their
clothes
are
full
of
you
will
feel
quite
differently
about
them
in
the
morning
don
t
forget
about
i
will
speak
about
it
at
once
suzanne
disappeared
walking
as
one
who
suspects
an
ambush
after
dinner
domini
went
again
to
the
verandah
she
found
batouch
there
he
had
now
folded
a
turban
round
his
head
and
looked
like
a
young
high
priest
of
some
ornate
religion
he
suggested
that
domini
should
come
out
with
him
to
visit
the
rue
des
ouled
nails
and
see
the
strange
dances
of
the
sahara
but
she
declined
not
batouch
i
must
go
to
bed
i
haven
t
slept
for
two
but
i
do
not
sleep
madame
in
the
night
i
compose
verses
my
brain
is
alive
my
heart
is
on
yes
but
i
am
not
a
poet
besides
i
may
be
here
for
a
long
time
i
shall
have
many
evenings
to
see
the
the
poet
looked
displeased
the
gentleman
is
going
he
said
hadj
is
at
the
door
waiting
for
him
now
but
hadj
is
afraid
when
he
enters
the
street
of
the
why
there
is
a
girl
there
who
wishes
to
kill
him
her
name
is
aishoush
she
was
sent
away
from
for
six
months
but
she
has
come
back
and
after
all
this
time
she
still
wishes
to
kill
what
has
he
done
to
her
he
has
not
loved
her
yes
hadj
is
afraid
but
he
will
go
with
the
gentleman
because
he
must
earn
money
to
buy
a
costume
for
the
of
ramadan
i
also
wish
to
buy
a
new
he
looked
at
domini
with
a
dignified
plaintiveness
his
pose
against
the
pillar
of
the
verandah
was
superb
over
his
blue
cloth
jacket
he
had
thrown
a
thin
white
burnous
which
hung
round
him
in
classic
folds
domini
could
scarcely
believe
that
so
magnificent
a
creature
was
touting
for
a
franc
the
idea
certainly
did
occur
to
her
but
she
banished
it
for
she
was
a
novice
in
africa
i
am
too
tired
to
go
out
she
said
decisively
madame
i
shall
be
here
morning
at
seven
o
clock
the
dawn
in
the
garden
of
the
gazelles
is
like
the
flames
of
paradise
and
you
can
see
the
spahis
galloping
upon
horses
that
are
beautiful
as
i
shall
not
get
up
early
batouch
assumed
an
expression
that
was
tragically
submissive
and
turned
to
go
just
then
suzanne
appeared
at
the
french
window
of
her
bedroom
she
started
as
she
perceived
the
poet
who
walked
slowly
past
her
to
the
staircase
throwing
his
burnous
back
from
his
big
shoulders
and
stood
looking
after
him
her
eyes
fixed
themselves
upon
the
section
of
bare
leg
that
was
visible
above
his
stockings
white
as
the
driven
snow
and
a
faintly
sentimental
expression
mingled
with
their
defiance
and
alarm
domini
got
up
from
her
chair
and
leaned
over
the
parapet
a
streak
of
yellow
light
from
the
doorway
of
the
hotel
lay
upon
the
white
road
below
and
in
a
moment
she
saw
two
figures
come
out
from
beneath
the
verandah
and
pause
there
hadj
was
one
the
stranger
was
the
other
the
stranger
struck
a
match
and
tried
to
light
a
cigar
but
failed
he
struck
another
match
and
then
another
but
still
the
cigar
would
not
draw
hadj
looked
at
him
with
mischievous
astonishment
if
monsieur
will
permit
me
he
began
but
the
stranger
took
the
cigar
hastily
from
his
mouth
and
flung
it
away
i
don
t
want
to
smoke
domini
heard
him
say
in
french
then
he
walked
away
with
hadj
into
the
darkness
as
they
disappeared
domini
heard
a
faint
shrieking
in
the
distance
it
was
the
music
of
the
african
hautboy
the
night
was
marvellously
dry
and
warm
the
thickly
growing
trees
in
the
garden
scarcely
moved
it
was
very
still
and
very
dark
suzanne
standing
at
her
window
looked
like
a
shadow
in
her
black
dress
her
attitude
was
romantic
perhaps
the
subtle
influence
of
this
sahara
village
was
beginning
to
steal
even
over
her
obdurate
spirit
the
hautboy
went
on
crying
its
notes
though
faint
were
sharp
and
piercing
once
more
the
church
bell
chimed
among
the
date
palms
and
the
two
musics
with
their
violently
differing
associations
clashing
together
smote
upon
domini
s
heart
with
a
sense
of
trouble
almost
of
tragedy
the
pulses
in
her
temples
throbbed
and
she
clasped
her
hands
tightly
together
that
brief
moment
in
which
she
heard
the
duet
of
those
two
voices
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
yet
also
one
of
the
most
painful
she
had
ever
known
the
church
bell
was
silent
now
but
the
hautboy
did
not
cease
it
was
barbarous
and
provocative
shrill
with
a
persistent
triumph
domini
went
to
bed
early
but
she
could
not
sleep
just
before
midnight
she
heard
someone
walking
up
and
down
on
the
verandah
the
step
was
heavy
and
shuffling
it
came
and
went
came
and
went
without
pause
till
she
was
in
a
fever
of
uneasiness
only
when
two
chimed
from
the
church
did
it
cease
at
last
she
whispered
a
prayer
to
notre
dame
de
la
garde
the
blessed
virgin
looking
towards
africa
for
the
first
time
she
felt
the
loneliness
of
her
situation
and
that
she
was
far
away
chapter
v
towards
morning
domini
slept
it
was
nearly
eight
o
clock
when
she
awoke
the
room
was
full
of
soft
light
which
told
of
the
sun
outside
and
she
got
up
at
once
put
on
a
pair
of
slippers
and
opened
the
french
window
on
to
the
verandah
already
was
bathed
in
golden
beams
and
full
of
gentle
activities
a
flock
of
goats
pattered
by
towards
the
edge
of
the
oasis
the
arab
gardeners
were
lazily
sweeping
small
leaves
from
the
narrow
paths
under
the
mimosa
and
pepper
trees
soldiers
in
loose
white
suits
dark
blue
sashes
and
the
fez
were
hastening
from
the
fort
towards
the
market
a
distant
bugle
rang
out
and
the
snarl
of
camels
was
audible
from
the
village
domini
stood
on
the
verandah
for
a
moment
drinking
in
the
desert
air
it
made
her
feel
very
pure
and
clean
as
if
she
had
just
bathed
in
clear
water
she
looked
up
at
the
limpid
sky
which
seemed
full
of
hope
and
of
the
power
to
grant
blessings
and
she
was
glad
that
she
had
come
to
her
lonely
sensation
of
the
previous
night
had
gone
as
she
stood
in
the
sun
she
was
conscious
that
she
needed
and
that
here
she
might
find
it
the
radiant
sky
the
warm
sun
and
the
freedom
of
the
coming
day
and
of
many
coming
desert
days
filled
her
heart
with
an
almost
childish
sensation
she
felt
younger
than
she
had
felt
for
years
and
even
foolishly
innocent
like
a
puppy
dog
or
a
kitten
her
thick
black
hair
unbound
fell
in
a
veil
round
her
strong
active
body
and
she
had
the
rare
consciousness
that
behind
that
other
more
mysterious
veil
her
soul
was
a
less
unfit
companion
for
its
mate
than
it
had
been
since
her
mother
s
sin
cleanliness
what
a
blessed
condition
that
was
a
condition
to
breed
bravery
in
this
early
morning
hour
looked
magically
clean
domini
thought
of
the
desperate
dirt
of
london
mornings
of
the
sooty
air
brooding
above
black
trees
and
greasy
pavements
surely
it
was
difficult
to
be
clean
of
soul
there
here
it
would
be
easy
one
would
tune
one
s
lyre
in
accord
with
nature
and
be
as
a
singing
palm
tree
beside
a
she
took
up
a
little
book
which
she
had
laid
at
night
upon
her
it
was
the
imitation
of
and
she
opened
it
at
haphazard
and
glanced
down
on
a
sunlit
page
her
eyes
fell
on
these
words
love
watcheth
and
sleeping
slumbereth
not
when
weary
it
is
not
tired
when
straitened
it
is
not
constrained
when
frightened
it
is
not
disturbed
but
like
a
vivid
flame
and
a
burning
torch
it
mounteth
upwards
and
securely
passeth
through
all
whosoever
loveth
knoweth
the
cry
of
this
the
sunlight
on
the
page
of
the
little
book
was
like
the
vivid
flame
and
the
burning
torch
spoken
of
in
it
heat
light
a
fierce
vitality
domini
had
been
weary
so
long
weary
of
soul
that
she
was
almost
startled
to
find
herself
responding
quickly
to
the
sacred
passion
on
the
page
to
the
bright
beam
that
kissed
it
as
twin
kisses
twin
she
knelt
down
to
say
her
morning
prayer
but
all
she
could
whisper
was
o
god
renew
me
o
god
renew
me
give
me
power
to
feel
keenly
fiercely
even
though
i
suffer
let
me
wake
let
me
feel
let
me
be
a
living
thing
once
more
o
god
renew
me
renew
me
while
she
prayed
she
pressed
her
face
so
hard
against
her
hands
that
patches
of
red
came
upon
her
cheeks
and
afterwards
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
her
first
real
passionate
prayer
in
had
been
almost
like
a
command
to
god
was
not
such
a
fierce
prayer
perhaps
a
blasphemy
she
rose
from
that
prayer
to
the
first
of
her
new
days
after
breakfast
she
looked
over
the
edge
of
the
verandah
and
saw
batouch
and
hadj
squatting
together
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
below
they
were
smoking
cigarettes
and
talking
eagerly
their
conversation
which
was
in
arabic
sounded
violent
the
accented
words
were
like
blows
domini
had
not
looked
over
the
parapet
for
more
than
a
minute
before
the
two
guides
saw
her
and
rose
smiling
to
their
feet
i
am
waiting
to
show
the
village
to
madame
said
batouch
coming
out
softly
into
the
road
while
hadj
remained
under
the
trees
exposing
his
teeth
in
a
sarcastic
grin
which
plainly
enough
conveyed
to
domini
his
pity
for
her
sad
mistake
in
not
engaging
him
as
her
attendant
domini
nodded
went
back
into
her
room
and
put
on
a
shady
hat
suzanne
handed
her
a
large
parasol
lined
with
green
and
she
descended
the
stairs
rather
slowly
she
was
not
sure
whether
she
wanted
a
companion
in
her
first
walk
about
there
would
be
more
savour
of
freedom
in
solitude
yet
she
had
hardly
the
heart
to
dismiss
batouch
with
all
his
dignity
and
determination
she
resolved
to
take
him
for
a
little
while
and
then
to
get
rid
of
him
on
some
pretext
perhaps
she
would
make
some
purchases
in
the
bazaars
and
send
him
to
the
hotel
with
them
madame
has
slept
well
asked
the
poet
as
she
emerged
into
the
sun
pretty
well
she
answered
nodding
again
to
hadj
whose
grin
became
more
mischievous
and
opening
her
parasol
where
are
we
going
wherever
madame
wishes
there
is
the
market
the
negro
village
the
mosque
the
casino
the
statue
of
the
cardinal
the
bazaars
the
garden
of
the
count
ferdinand
a
garden
said
domini
is
it
a
beautiful
one
batouch
was
about
to
burst
into
a
lyric
ecstasy
but
he
checked
himself
and
said
madame
shall
see
for
herself
and
tell
me
afterwards
if
in
all
europe
there
is
one
such
oh
the
english
gardens
are
wonderful
she
said
smiling
at
his
patriotic
conceit
no
doubt
madame
shall
tell
me
madame
shall
tell
me
he
repeated
with
imperturbable
confidence
but
first
i
wish
to
go
for
a
moment
into
the
church
she
said
wait
for
me
here
she
crossed
the
road
passed
the
modest
house
of
the
priest
and
came
to
the
church
which
looked
out
on
to
the
quiet
gardens
before
going
up
the
steps
and
in
at
the
door
she
paused
for
a
moment
there
was
something
touching
to
her
as
a
catholic
in
this
symbol
of
her
faith
set
thus
far
out
in
the
midst
of
islamism
the
cross
was
surely
rather
lonely
here
raised
above
the
men
to
whom
it
meant
nothing
she
was
conscious
that
since
she
had
come
to
this
land
of
another
creed
and
of
another
creed
held
with
fanaticism
her
sentiment
for
her
own
religion
which
in
england
for
many
years
had
been
but
lukewarm
had
suddenly
gained
in
strength
she
had
an
odd
almost
manly
sensation
that
it
was
her
duty
in
africa
to
stand
up
for
her
faith
not
blatantly
in
words
to
impress
others
but
perseveringly
in
heart
to
satisfy
herself
sometimes
she
felt
very
protective
she
felt
protective
today
as
she
looked
at
this
humble
building
which
she
likened
to
one
of
the
poor
saints
of
the
thebaid
who
dwelt
afar
in
desert
places
and
whose
devotions
were
broken
by
the
of
jackals
and
by
the
roar
of
ravenous
beasts
with
this
feeling
strong
upon
her
she
pushed
open
the
door
and
went
in
the
interior
was
plain
even
ugly
the
walls
were
painted
a
hideous
drab
the
stone
floor
was
covered
with
small
hard
chairs
and
narrow
wooden
forms
for
the
patient
knees
of
worshippers
in
the
front
were
two
rows
of
private
chairs
with
velvet
cushions
of
various
brilliant
hues
and
rails
on
the
left
was
a
high
stone
pulpit
the
altar
beyond
its
mean
black
and
gold
railing
was
dingy
and
forlorn
on
it
there
was
a
tiny
gold
cross
with
a
gold
statuette
of
christ
hanging
surmounted
by
a
canopy
with
four
pillars
which
looked
as
if
made
of
some
unwholesome
sweetmeat
long
candles
of
blue
and
gold
and
bouquets
of
dusty
artificial
flowers
flanked
it
behind
it
in
a
round
niche
stood
a
painted
figure
of
christ
holding
a
book
the
two
adjacent
side
chapels
had
domed
roofs
representing
the
firmament
beneath
the
pulpit
stood
a
small
harmonium
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
church
was
a
high
gallery
holding
more
chairs
the
mean
featureless
windows
were
filled
with
glass
half
white
half
staring
red
dotted
with
yellow
crosses
round
the
walls
were
reliefs
of
the
fourteen
stations
of
the
cross
in
white
plaster
on
a
gilt
ground
framed
in
grey
marble
from
the
roof
hung
vulgar
glass
chandeliers
with
ropes
tied
with
faded
pink
ribands
several
frightful
plaster
statues
daubed
with
scarlet
and
chocolate
brown
stood
under
the
windows
which
were
protected
with
brown
woollen
curtains
close
to
the
entrance
were
a
receptacle
for
holy
water
in
the
form
of
a
shell
and
a
confessional
of
stone
flanked
by
boxes
one
of
which
bore
the
words
graces
obtenues
the
other
demandes
and
a
card
on
which
was
printed
litanies
en
honneur
de
saint
antoine
de
there
was
nothing
to
please
the
eye
nothing
to
appeal
to
the
senses
there
was
not
even
the
mystery
which
shrouds
and
softens
for
the
sunshine
streamed
in
through
the
white
glass
of
the
windows
revealing
even
emphasising
as
if
with
deliberate
cruelty
the
cheap
finery
the
tarnished
velvet
the
crude
colours
the
meretricious
gestures
and
poses
of
the
plaster
saints
yet
as
domini
touched
her
forehead
and
breast
with
holy
water
and
knelt
for
a
moment
on
the
stone
floor
she
was
conscious
that
this
rather
pitiful
house
of
god
moved
her
to
an
emotion
she
had
not
felt
in
the
great
and
beautiful
churches
to
which
she
was
accustomed
in
england
and
on
the
continent
through
the
windows
she
saw
the
outlines
of
palm
leaves
vibrating
in
the
breeze
african
fingers
feeling
with
a
sort
of
fluttering
suspicion
if
not
enmity
round
the
heart
of
this
intruding
religion
which
had
wandered
hither
from
some
distant
place
and
stayed
confronting
the
burning
glance
of
the
desert
bold
little
humble
church
domini
knew
that
she
would
love
it
but
she
did
not
know
then
how
much
she
wandered
round
slowly
with
a
grave
face
yet
now
and
then
as
she
stood
by
one
of
the
plaster
saints
she
smiled
they
were
indeed
strange
offerings
at
the
shrine
of
him
who
held
this
africa
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
of
him
who
had
ordered
the
pageant
of
the
sun
which
she
had
seen
last
night
among
the
mountains
and
presently
she
and
this
little
church
in
which
she
stood
alone
became
pathetic
in
her
thoughts
and
even
the
religion
which
the
one
came
to
profess
in
the
other
pathetic
too
for
here
in
africa
she
began
to
realise
the
wideness
of
the
world
and
that
many
things
must
surely
seem
to
the
creator
what
these
plaster
saints
seemed
just
then
to
her
oh
how
little
how
little
she
whispered
to
herself
let
me
be
bigger
oh
let
me
grow
and
here
not
only
hereafter
the
church
door
creaked
she
turned
her
head
and
saw
the
priest
whom
she
had
met
in
the
tunnel
entering
he
came
up
to
her
at
once
saluted
her
and
said
i
saw
you
from
my
window
madame
and
thought
i
would
offer
to
show
you
our
little
church
here
we
are
very
proud
of
domini
liked
his
voice
and
his
naive
remark
his
face
too
though
undistinguished
looked
honest
kind
and
pathetic
but
with
a
pathos
that
was
unaffected
and
quite
unconscious
the
lower
part
of
it
was
hidden
by
a
moustache
and
beard
thank
you
she
answered
i
have
been
looking
round
you
are
a
catholic
madame
the
priest
looked
pleased
there
was
something
childlike
in
the
mobility
of
his
face
i
am
glad
he
said
simply
we
are
not
a
rich
community
in
but
we
have
been
fortunate
in
bygone
years
our
great
cardinal
the
father
of
africa
loved
this
place
and
cherished
his
children
cardinal
lavigerie
yes
madame
his
house
is
now
a
native
hospital
his
statue
faces
the
beginning
of
the
great
desert
road
but
we
remember
him
and
his
spirit
is
still
among
the
priest
s
eyes
lit
up
as
he
spoke
the
almost
tragic
expression
of
his
face
changed
to
one
of
enthusiasm
he
loved
africa
i
believe
domini
said
his
heart
was
here
and
what
he
did
i
was
to
have
been
one
of
his
but
my
health
prevented
and
afterwards
the
association
was
the
sad
expression
returned
to
his
face
there
are
many
temptations
in
such
a
land
and
climate
as
this
he
said
and
men
are
weak
but
there
are
still
the
white
fathers
whom
he
founded
glorious
men
they
carry
the
cross
into
the
wildest
places
of
the
world
the
most
fanatical
arabs
respect
the
white
you
wish
you
were
with
them
yes
madame
but
my
health
only
permits
me
to
be
a
humble
parish
priest
here
not
all
who
desire
to
enter
the
most
severe
life
can
do
so
if
it
were
otherwise
i
should
long
since
have
been
a
monk
the
cardinal
himself
showed
me
that
my
duty
lay
in
other
he
pointed
out
to
domini
one
or
two
things
in
the
church
which
he
admired
and
thought
worthy
the
carving
of
the
altar
rail
into
grapes
ears
of
corn
crosses
anchors
the
white
embroidered
muslin
that
draped
the
tabernacle
the
statue
of
a
bishop
in
a
red
and
gold
mitre
holding
a
staff
and
bible
and
another
statue
representing
a
saint
with
a
languid
and
consumptive
expression
stretching
out
a
bible
on
the
leaves
of
which
a
tiny
smiling
child
was
walking
as
they
were
about
to
leave
the
church
he
made
domini
pause
in
front
of
a
painting
of
saint
bruno
dressed
in
a
white
monkish
robe
beneath
which
was
written
in
gilt
letters
saint
bruno
ordonne
a
ses
disciples
de
renoncer
aux
biens
terrestres
pour
acquerir
les
biens
the
disciples
stood
around
the
saint
in
grotesque
attitudes
of
pious
attention
that
i
think
is
very
beautiful
he
said
who
could
look
at
it
without
feeling
that
the
greatest
act
of
man
is
renunciation
his
dark
eyes
flamed
just
then
a
faint
soprano
bark
came
to
them
from
outside
the
church
door
a
very
discreet
and
even
humble
but
at
the
same
time
anxious
bark
the
priest
s
face
changed
the
almost
passionate
asceticism
of
it
was
replaced
by
a
soft
and
gentle
look
wants
me
he
said
and
he
opened
the
door
for
domini
to
pass
out
a
small
white
and
yellow
dog
very
clean
and
well
brushed
was
sitting
on
the
step
in
an
attentive
attitude
directly
the
priest
appeared
it
began
to
wag
its
short
tail
violently
and
to
run
round
his
feet
curving
its
body
into
he
bent
down
and
patted
it
my
little
companion
madame
he
said
he
was
not
with
me
yesterday
as
he
was
being
then
he
took
off
his
hat
and
walked
towards
his
house
accompanied
by
who
had
suddenly
assumed
an
air
of
conscious
majesty
as
of
one
born
to
preside
over
the
fate
of
an
important
personage
domini
stood
for
a
moment
under
the
palm
trees
looking
after
them
there
was
a
steady
shining
in
her
eyes
madame
is
a
catholic
too
asked
batouch
staring
steadily
at
her
domini
nodded
she
did
not
want
to
discuss
religion
with
an
arab
minor
poet
just
then
take
me
to
the
market
she
said
mindful
of
her
secret
resolve
to
get
rid
of
her
companion
as
soon
as
possible
they
set
out
across
the
gardens
it
was
a
celestial
day
all
the
clear
untempered
light
of
the
world
seemed
to
have
made
its
home
in
yet
the
heat
was
not
excessive
for
the
glorious
strength
of
the
sun
was
robbed
of
its
terror
its
possible
brutality
by
the
bright
and
feathery
dryness
and
coolness
of
the
airs
she
stepped
out
briskly
her
body
seemed
suddenly
to
become
years
younger
full
of
elasticity
and
radiant
strength
madame
is
very
strong
madame
walks
like
a
batouch
s
voice
sounded
seriously
astonished
and
domini
burst
out
laughing
in
england
there
are
many
strong
women
but
i
shall
grow
stronger
here
i
shall
become
a
real
arab
this
air
gives
me
they
were
just
reaching
the
road
when
there
was
a
clatter
of
hoofs
and
a
spahi
mounted
on
a
slim
white
horse
galloped
past
at
a
tremendous
pace
holding
his
reins
high
above
the
red
peak
of
his
saddle
and
staring
up
at
the
sun
domini
looked
after
him
with
critical
admiration
you
ve
got
some
good
horses
here
she
said
when
the
spahi
had
disappeared
madame
knows
how
to
ride
she
laughed
again
i
ve
ridden
ever
since
i
was
a
you
can
buy
a
fine
horse
here
for
sixteen
pounds
remarked
batouch
using
the
pronoun
tu
as
is
the
custom
of
the
arabs
find
me
a
good
horse
a
horse
with
spirit
and
i
ll
buy
him
domini
said
i
want
to
go
far
out
in
the
desert
far
away
from
you
must
not
go
why
not
there
are
bandits
in
the
i
ll
take
my
revolver
domini
said
carelessly
but
i
will
go
they
were
in
sight
of
the
market
now
and
the
hum
of
voices
came
to
them
with
nasal
cries
the
whine
of
praying
beggars
and
the
fierce
braying
of
donkeys
at
the
end
of
the
small
street
in
which
they
were
domini
saw
a
wide
open
space
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
a
quantity
of
pillars
supporting
a
peaked
roof
round
the
sides
of
the
square
were
arcades
swarming
with
arabs
and
under
the
central
roof
a
mob
of
figures
came
and
went
as
flies
go
and
come
on
a
piece
of
meat
flung
out
into
a
sunny
place
what
a
quantity
of
people
do
they
all
live
in
she
asked
no
they
come
from
all
parts
of
the
desert
to
sell
and
to
buy
but
most
of
those
who
sell
are
little
children
in
rags
came
dancing
round
domini
holding
out
their
hands
and
crying
shrilly
msee
m
dame
msee
m
dame
a
deformed
man
who
looked
like
a
distorted
beetle
crept
round
her
feet
gazing
up
at
her
with
eyes
that
squinted
horribly
and
roaring
in
an
imperative
voice
some
arab
formula
in
which
the
words
continually
recurred
a
tall
negro
with
a
long
tuft
of
hair
hanging
from
his
shaven
head
followed
hard
upon
her
heels
rolling
his
bulging
eyes
in
which
two
yellow
flames
were
caught
and
trying
to
engage
her
attention
though
with
what
object
she
could
not
imagine
from
all
directions
tall
men
with
naked
arms
and
legs
and
fluttering
white
garments
came
slowly
towards
her
staring
intently
at
her
with
lustrous
eyes
whose
expression
seemed
to
denote
rather
a
calm
and
dignified
appraisement
than
any
vulgar
curiosity
boys
with
the
whitest
teeth
she
had
ever
beheld
and
flowers
above
their
delicate
ears
smiled
up
at
her
with
engaging
impudence
her
nostrils
were
filled
with
a
strange
crowd
of
odours
which
came
from
humanity
dressed
in
woollen
garments
from
fruits
exposed
for
sale
in
rush
panniers
from
round
close
bouquets
of
roses
ringed
with
tight
borders
of
green
leaves
from
burning
incense
twigs
from
raw
meat
from
amber
ornaments
and
strong
perfumes
in
glass
phials
figured
with
gold
attar
of
rose
orange
blossom
geranium
and
white
lilac
in
the
shining
heat
of
the
sun
sounds
scents
and
movements
mingled
and
were
almost
painfully
vivid
and
full
of
meaning
and
animation
never
had
a
london
mob
on
some
great
day
seemed
so
significant
and
personal
to
domini
as
this
little
mob
of
desert
people
come
together
for
the
bartering
of
beasts
the
buying
of
burnouses
weapons
skins
and
jewels
grain
for
their
camels
charms
for
their
women
ripe
glistening
dates
for
the
little
children
at
home
in
the
brown
earth
houses
as
she
made
her
way
slowly
through
the
press
pioneered
by
batouch
who
forced
a
path
with
great
play
of
his
huge
shoulders
and
mighty
arms
she
was
surprised
to
find
how
much
at
home
she
felt
in
the
midst
of
these
fierce
and
people
she
had
no
sense
of
shrinking
from
their
contact
no
feeling
of
personal
disgust
at
their
touch
when
her
eyes
chanced
to
meet
any
of
the
bold
inquiring
eyes
around
her
she
was
inclined
to
smile
as
if
in
recognition
of
these
children
of
the
sun
who
did
not
seem
to
her
like
strangers
despite
the
unknown
language
that
struggled
fiercely
in
their
throats
nevertheless
she
did
not
wish
to
stay
very
long
among
them
now
she
was
resolved
to
get
a
full
and
delicately
complete
first
impression
of
and
to
do
that
she
knew
that
she
must
detach
herself
from
close
human
contact
she
desired
the
mind
s
bird
view
a
height
a
watchtower
and
a
little
solitude
so
when
the
eager
mozabite
merchants
called
to
her
she
did
not
heed
them
and
even
the
busy
patter
of
the
informing
batouch
fell
upon
rather
listless
ears
i
sha
n
t
stay
here
she
said
to
him
but
i
ll
buy
some
perfumes
where
can
i
get
them
a
thin
youth
brooding
above
a
wooden
tray
close
by
held
up
in
his
delicate
fingers
a
long
bottle
sealed
and
furnished
with
a
tiny
label
but
batouch
shook
his
head
for
perfumes
you
must
go
to
ahmeda
under
the
they
crossed
a
sunlit
space
and
stood
before
a
dark
room
sunk
lightly
below
the
level
of
the
pathway
in
a
deserted
corner
shadows
congregated
here
and
in
the
gloom
domini
saw
a
bent
white
figure
hunched
against
the
blackened
wall
and
heard
an
old
voice
murmuring
like
a
drowsy
bee
the
was
immersed
in
the
koran
his
back
to
the
buying
world
batouch
was
about
to
call
upon
him
when
domini
checked
the
exclamation
with
a
quick
gesture
for
the
first
time
the
mystery
that
coils
like
a
great
black
serpent
in
the
shining
heart
of
the
east
startled
and
fascinated
her
a
mystery
in
which
indifference
and
devotion
mingle
the
white
figure
swayed
slowly
to
and
fro
carrying
the
dull
humming
voice
with
it
and
now
she
seemed
to
hear
a
fanaticism
the
bourdon
of
a
fatalism
which
she
longed
to
understand
ahmeda
batouch
shouted
his
voice
came
like
a
stone
from
a
catapult
the
merchant
turned
calmly
and
without
haste
showing
an
aquiline
face
covered
with
wrinkles
tufted
with
white
hairs
lit
by
eyes
that
shone
with
the
cruel
expressiveness
of
a
falcon
s
after
a
short
colloquy
in
arabic
he
raised
himself
from
his
haunches
and
came
to
the
front
of
the
room
where
there
was
a
small
wooden
counter
he
was
smiling
now
with
a
grace
that
was
almost
feminine
what
perfume
does
madame
desire
he
said
in
french
domini
gazed
at
him
as
at
a
deep
mystery
but
with
the
searching
directness
characteristic
of
her
a
fearlessness
so
absolute
that
it
embarrassed
many
people
please
give
me
something
that
is
of
the
east
not
violets
not
amber
said
batouch
the
merchant
still
smiling
reached
up
to
a
shelf
showing
an
arm
like
a
brown
twig
and
took
down
a
glass
bottle
covered
with
red
and
green
lines
he
removed
the
stopper
made
domini
take
off
her
glove
touched
her
bare
hand
with
the
stopper
then
with
his
forefinger
gently
rubbed
the
drop
of
perfume
which
had
settled
on
her
skin
till
it
was
slightly
red
now
smell
it
he
commanded
domini
obeyed
the
perfume
was
faintly
medicinal
but
it
filled
her
brain
with
exotic
visions
she
shut
her
eyes
yes
that
was
a
voice
of
africa
too
oh
how
far
away
she
was
from
her
old
life
and
hollow
days
the
magic
carpet
had
been
spread
indeed
and
she
had
been
wafted
into
a
strange
land
where
she
had
all
to
learn
please
give
me
some
of
that
she
said
the
merchant
poured
the
amber
into
a
phial
where
it
lay
like
a
thread
in
the
glass
weighed
it
in
a
scales
and
demanded
a
price
batouch
began
at
once
to
argue
with
vehemence
but
domini
stopped
him
pay
him
she
said
giving
batouch
her
purse
the
took
the
money
with
dignity
turned
away
squatted
upon
his
haunches
against
the
blackened
wall
and
picked
up
the
volume
which
lay
upon
the
floor
he
swayed
gently
and
rhythmically
to
and
fro
then
once
more
the
voice
of
the
drowsy
bee
hummed
in
the
shadows
the
worshipper
and
the
prophet
stood
before
the
feet
of
allah
and
the
woman
she
was
set
afar
off
as
woman
is
by
men
in
africa
now
batouch
you
can
carry
the
perfume
to
the
hotel
and
i
will
go
to
that
alone
madame
will
never
find
i
can
ask
the
impossible
i
will
escort
madame
to
the
gate
there
i
will
wait
for
her
monsieur
the
count
does
not
permit
the
arabs
to
enter
with
very
well
domini
said
the
seller
of
perfumes
had
led
her
towards
a
dream
she
was
not
combative
and
she
would
be
alone
in
the
garden
as
they
walked
towards
it
in
the
sun
through
narrow
ways
where
idle
arabs
lounged
with
happy
aimlessness
batouch
talked
of
count
anteoni
the
owner
of
the
garden
evidently
the
count
was
the
great
personage
of
batouch
spoke
of
him
with
a
convinced
respect
describing
him
as
fabulously
rich
fabulously
generous
to
the
arabs
he
never
gives
to
the
french
madame
but
when
he
is
here
each
friday
upon
our
sabbath
he
comes
to
the
gate
with
a
bag
of
money
in
his
hand
and
he
gives
five
franc
pieces
to
every
arab
who
is
and
what
is
he
french
he
is
italian
but
he
is
always
travelling
and
he
has
made
gardens
everywhere
he
has
three
in
africa
alone
and
in
one
he
keeps
many
lions
when
he
travels
he
takes
six
arabs
with
him
he
loves
only
the
domini
began
to
feel
interested
in
this
wandering
maker
of
gardens
who
was
a
pilgrim
over
the
world
like
monte
cristo
is
he
young
she
asked
married
oh
no
he
is
always
alone
sometimes
he
comes
here
and
stays
for
three
months
and
is
never
once
seen
outside
the
garden
and
sometimes
for
a
year
he
never
comes
to
but
he
is
here
now
twenty
arabs
are
always
working
in
the
garden
and
at
night
ten
arabs
with
guns
are
always
awake
some
in
a
tent
inside
the
door
and
some
among
the
trees
then
there
is
danger
at
night
the
garden
touches
the
desert
and
those
who
are
in
the
desert
without
arms
are
as
birds
in
the
air
without
they
had
come
out
from
among
the
houses
now
into
a
broad
straight
road
bordered
on
the
left
by
land
that
was
under
cultivation
by
fruit
trees
and
farther
away
by
giant
palms
between
whose
trunks
could
be
seen
the
stony
reaches
of
the
desert
and
spurs
of
and
faint
mountains
on
the
right
was
a
shady
garden
with
fountains
and
stone
benches
and
beyond
stood
a
huge
white
palace
built
in
the
moorish
style
and
terraced
roofs
and
a
high
tower
ornamented
with
green
and
tiles
in
the
distance
among
more
palms
appeared
a
number
of
low
flat
huts
of
brown
earth
the
road
as
far
as
the
eyes
could
see
stretched
straight
forward
through
enormous
groves
of
palms
whose
feathery
tops
swayed
gently
in
the
light
wind
that
blew
from
the
desert
upon
all
things
rained
a
flood
of
blue
and
gold
a
blinding
radiance
made
all
things
glad
how
glorious
light
is
domini
exclaimed
as
she
looked
down
the
road
to
the
point
where
its
whiteness
was
lost
in
the
moving
ocean
of
the
trees
batouch
assented
without
enthusiasm
having
always
lived
in
the
light
as
we
return
from
the
garden
we
will
visit
the
tower
he
said
pointing
to
the
moorish
palace
it
is
a
hotel
and
is
not
yet
open
but
i
know
the
guardian
from
the
tower
madame
will
see
the
whole
of
here
is
the
negro
they
traversed
its
dusty
alleys
slowly
on
the
side
where
the
low
brown
dwellings
threw
shadows
some
of
the
inhabitants
were
dreaming
or
chattering
wrapped
in
garments
of
gaudy
cotton
little
girls
in
the
fiercest
orange
colour
with
tattooed
foreheads
and
leathern
amulets
darted
to
and
fro
chasing
each
other
and
shrieking
with
laughter
naked
babies
whose
shaven
heads
made
a
warm
for
flies
stared
at
domini
with
a
lustrous
vacancy
of
expression
at
the
corners
of
the
alleys
unveiled
women
squatted
grinding
corn
in
primitive
or
winding
wool
on
wooden
sticks
their
heads
were
covered
with
plaits
of
imitation
hair
made
of
wool
in
which
barbaric
silver
ornaments
were
fastened
and
their
black
necks
and
arms
jingled
with
chains
and
bangles
set
with
squares
of
red
coral
and
large
dull
blue
and
green
stones
some
of
them
called
boldly
to
batouch
and
he
answered
them
with
careless
impudence
the
door
of
one
of
the
houses
stood
wide
open
and
domini
looked
in
she
saw
a
dark
space
with
floor
and
walls
of
earth
a
ceiling
of
palm
and
brushwood
a
low
divan
of
earth
without
mat
or
covering
of
any
kind
they
have
no
furniture
she
asked
batouch
no
what
do
they
want
with
it
they
live
out
here
in
the
sun
and
go
in
to
life
simplified
to
this
extent
made
her
smile
yet
she
looked
at
the
squatting
figures
in
the
gaudy
cotton
rags
with
a
stirring
of
envy
the
memory
of
her
long
and
complicated
london
years
filled
with
a
multitude
of
pleasures
which
had
never
stifled
the
dull
pain
set
up
in
her
heart
by
the
rude
shock
of
her
mother
s
sin
and
its
result
made
this
naked
sunny
barbarous
existence
seem
desirable
she
stood
for
a
moment
to
watch
two
women
sorting
grain
for
their
guttural
laughter
their
noisy
talk
the
quick
and
energetic
movements
of
their
busy
black
hands
reminded
her
of
children
s
gaiety
and
nature
rose
before
her
in
the
sunshine
confronting
artifice
and
the
heavy
languors
of
modern
life
in
cities
how
had
she
been
able
to
endure
the
yoke
so
long
will
madame
take
me
to
london
with
her
when
she
returns
said
batouch
slyly
i
am
not
going
back
to
london
for
a
very
long
time
she
replied
with
energy
you
will
stay
here
many
weeks
months
perhaps
and
perhaps
i
shall
travel
on
into
the
desert
yes
i
must
do
if
we
followed
the
white
road
into
the
desert
and
went
on
and
on
for
many
days
we
should
come
at
last
to
tombouctou
said
batouch
but
very
likely
we
should
be
killed
by
the
touaregs
they
are
fierce
and
they
hate
would
you
be
afraid
to
go
domini
asked
him
curiously
why
afraid
of
being
killed
he
looked
calmly
surprised
why
should
i
be
afraid
to
die
all
must
pass
through
that
door
it
does
not
matter
whether
it
is
or
you
have
no
fear
of
death
then
of
course
not
have
you
madame
he
gazed
at
domini
with
genuine
astonishment
i
don
t
know
she
answered
and
she
wondered
and
could
not
tell
there
is
the
villa
batouch
lifted
his
hand
and
pointed
they
had
turned
aside
from
the
way
to
tombouctou
left
the
village
behind
them
and
come
into
a
narrow
track
which
ran
parallel
to
the
desert
the
palm
trees
rustled
on
their
right
the
green
corn
waved
the
narrow
cuttings
in
the
earth
gleamed
with
shallow
water
but
on
their
other
side
was
limitless
sterility
the
wide
stony
expanse
of
the
great
river
bed
the
then
a
low
earth
cliff
and
then
the
immense
airy
flats
stretching
away
into
the
shining
regions
of
the
sun
at
some
distance
raised
on
a
dazzling
white
wall
above
the
desert
in
an
unshaded
place
domini
saw
a
narrow
white
house
with
a
flat
roof
and
a
few
tiny
loopholes
instead
of
windows
one
side
looked
full
upon
the
waterless
river
bed
the
other
at
right
angles
to
it
ran
back
towards
a
thicket
of
palms
and
ended
in
an
arcade
of
six
open
moorish
arches
through
which
the
fierce
blue
of
the
cloudless
sky
stared
making
an
almost
theatrical
effect
beyond
masses
of
trees
were
visible
looking
almost
black
against
the
intense
blinding
pallor
of
wall
villa
and
arcade
the
intense
blue
above
what
a
strange
house
domini
said
there
are
no
they
are
all
on
the
other
side
looking
into
the
the
villa
fascinated
domini
at
once
the
white
moorish
arcade
framing
bare
quivering
blue
blue
from
the
inmost
heart
of
heaven
intense
as
a
great
vehement
cry
was
beautiful
as
the
arcade
of
a
geni
s
home
in
fairyland
mystery
hung
about
this
dwelling
a
mystery
of
light
not
darkness
secrets
of
flame
and
hidden
things
of
golden
meaning
she
felt
almost
like
a
child
who
is
about
to
penetrate
into
the
red
land
of
the
winter
fire
and
she
hastened
her
steps
till
she
reached
a
tall
white
gate
set
in
an
arch
of
wood
and
surmounted
with
a
white
coat
of
arms
and
two
lions
batouch
struck
on
it
with
a
white
knocker
and
then
began
to
roll
a
cigarette
i
will
wait
here
for
domini
nodded
a
leaf
of
wood
was
pulled
back
softly
in
the
gate
and
she
stepped
into
the
garden
and
confronted
a
graceful
young
arab
dressed
in
pale
green
who
saluted
her
respectfully
and
gently
closed
the
door
may
i
walk
about
the
garden
a
little
she
asked
she
did
not
look
round
her
yet
for
the
arab
s
face
interested
and
even
charmed
her
it
was
aristocratic
enchantingly
indolent
like
the
face
of
a
happy
the
great
lustrous
eyes
were
tender
as
a
gazelle
s
and
thoughtless
as
the
eyes
of
a
sleepy
child
his
feet
were
bare
on
the
shining
sand
in
one
hand
he
held
a
large
red
rose
and
in
the
other
a
cigarette
domini
could
not
kelp
smiling
at
him
as
she
put
her
question
and
he
smiled
contentedly
back
at
her
as
he
answered
in
a
low
level
voice
you
can
go
where
you
will
shall
i
show
you
the
paths
he
lifted
his
hand
and
calmly
smelt
his
red
rose
keeping
his
great
eyes
fixed
upon
her
domini
s
wish
to
be
alone
had
left
her
this
was
surely
the
geni
of
the
garden
and
his
company
would
add
to
its
mystery
and
fragrance
you
need
not
stay
by
the
door
she
asked
no
one
will
come
there
is
no
one
in
and
hassan
will
he
pointed
with
his
rose
to
a
little
tent
that
was
pitched
close
to
the
gate
beneath
a
pepper
tree
in
it
domini
saw
a
brown
boy
curled
up
like
a
dog
and
fast
asleep
she
began
to
feel
as
if
she
had
eaten
hashish
the
world
seemed
made
for
dreaming
thank
you
and
now
for
the
first
time
she
looked
round
to
see
whether
batouch
had
implied
the
truth
must
the
european
gardens
give
way
to
this
eastern
garden
take
a
lower
place
with
all
their
roses
she
stood
on
a
great
expanse
of
smooth
sand
rising
in
a
very
gentle
slope
to
a
gigantic
hedge
of
carefully
trimmed
evergreens
which
projected
at
the
top
forming
a
roof
and
casting
a
pleasant
shade
upon
the
sand
at
intervals
white
benches
were
placed
under
this
hedge
to
the
right
was
the
villa
she
saw
now
that
it
was
quite
small
there
were
two
lines
of
windows
on
the
ground
floor
and
the
upper
story
the
lower
windows
opened
on
to
the
sand
those
above
on
to
a
verandah
with
a
white
railing
which
was
gained
by
a
white
staircase
outside
the
house
built
beneath
the
arches
of
the
arcade
the
villa
was
most
delicately
simple
but
in
this
riot
of
blue
and
gold
its
ivory
cleanliness
set
there
upon
the
shining
sand
which
was
warm
to
the
foot
made
it
look
magical
to
domini
she
thought
she
had
never
known
before
what
spotless
purity
was
like
those
are
the
bedrooms
murmured
the
arab
at
her
side
there
are
only
bedrooms
she
asked
in
surprise
the
other
rooms
the
of
monsieur
the
count
the
the
the
moorish
bath
the
room
of
the
little
dog
the
kitchen
and
the
rooms
for
the
servants
are
in
different
parts
of
the
garden
there
is
the
he
pointed
with
his
rose
to
a
large
white
building
whose
dazzling
walls
showed
here
and
there
through
the
masses
of
trees
to
the
left
where
a
little
raised
with
flattened
sloping
sides
wound
away
into
a
maze
of
shadows
diapered
with
gold
let
us
go
down
that
path
domini
said
almost
in
a
whisper
the
spell
of
the
place
was
descending
upon
her
this
was
surely
a
home
of
dreams
a
haven
where
the
sun
came
to
lie
down
beneath
the
trees
and
sleep
what
is
your
name
she
added
smain
replied
the
arab
i
was
born
in
this
garden
my
father
mohammed
was
with
monsieur
the
he
led
the
way
over
the
sand
moving
silently
on
his
long
brown
feet
straight
as
a
reed
in
a
windless
place
domini
followed
holding
her
breath
only
sometimes
she
let
her
strong
imagination
play
utterly
at
its
will
she
let
it
go
now
as
she
and
smain
turned
into
the
golden
diapered
shadows
of
the
little
path
and
came
into
the
swaying
mystery
of
the
trees
the
longing
for
secrecy
for
remoteness
for
the
beauty
of
far
away
had
sometimes
haunted
her
especially
in
the
troubled
moments
of
her
life
her
heart
oppressed
had
overleaped
the
horizon
line
in
answer
to
a
calling
from
hidden
things
beyond
her
emotions
had
wandered
seeking
the
great
distances
in
which
the
dim
purple
twilight
holds
surely
comfort
for
those
who
suffer
but
she
had
never
thought
to
find
any
garden
of
peace
that
realised
her
dreams
nevertheless
she
was
already
conscious
that
smain
with
his
rose
was
showing
her
the
way
to
her
ideal
that
her
feet
were
set
upon
its
pathway
that
its
legendary
trees
were
closing
round
her
behind
the
evergreen
hedge
she
heard
the
liquid
bubbling
of
a
hidden
waterfall
and
when
they
had
left
the
untempered
sunlight
behind
them
this
murmur
grew
louder
it
seemed
as
if
the
green
gloom
in
which
they
walked
acted
as
a
to
the
delicious
voice
the
little
path
wound
on
and
on
between
two
running
rills
of
water
which
slipped
incessantly
away
under
the
broad
and
leaves
of
dwarf
palms
making
a
music
so
faint
that
it
was
more
like
a
remembered
sound
in
the
mind
than
one
which
slid
upon
the
ear
on
either
hand
towered
a
jungle
of
trees
brought
to
this
home
in
the
desert
from
all
parts
of
the
world
there
were
many
unknown
to
domini
but
she
recognised
several
varieties
of
palms
acacias
gums
fig
trees
chestnuts
poplars
false
pepper
trees
the
huge
olive
trees
called
jamelons
white
laurels
indiarubber
and
cocoanut
trees
bananas
bamboos
yuccas
many
mimosas
and
quantities
of
tall
eucalyptus
trees
thickets
of
scarlet
geranium
flamed
in
the
twilight
the
hibiscus
lifted
languidly
its
frail
and
rosy
cup
and
the
red
gold
oranges
gleamed
amid
leaves
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
polished
by
an
attentive
fairy
as
she
went
with
smain
farther
into
the
recesses
of
the
garden
the
voice
of
the
waterfall
died
away
no
birds
were
singing
domini
thought
that
perhaps
they
dared
not
sing
lest
they
might
wake
the
sun
from
its
golden
reveries
but
afterwards
when
she
knew
the
garden
better
she
often
heard
them
twittering
with
a
subdued
yet
happy
languor
as
if
joining
in
a
nocturn
upon
the
edge
of
sleep
under
the
trees
the
sand
was
yellow
of
a
shade
so
voluptuously
beautiful
that
she
longed
to
touch
it
with
her
bare
feet
like
smain
here
and
there
it
rose
in
symmetrical
little
pyramids
which
hinted
at
absent
gardeners
perhaps
enjoying
a
siesta
never
before
had
she
fully
understood
the
enchantment
of
green
quite
realised
how
happy
a
choice
was
made
on
that
day
of
creation
when
it
was
showered
prodigally
over
the
world
but
now
as
she
walked
secretly
over
the
yellow
sand
between
the
rills
following
the
floating
green
robe
of
smain
she
rested
her
eyes
and
her
soul
on
countless
mingling
shades
of
the
delicious
colour
rough
furry
green
of
geranium
leaves
silver
green
of
olives
black
green
of
distant
palms
from
which
the
sun
held
aloof
faded
green
of
the
eucalyptus
rich
emerald
green
of
sunlit
palms
hot
sultry
green
of
bamboos
dull
drowsy
green
of
mulberry
trees
and
brooding
chestnuts
it
was
a
choir
of
colours
in
one
colour
like
a
choir
of
boys
all
with
treble
voices
singing
to
the
sun
gold
flickered
everywhere
weaving
patterns
of
enchantment
quivering
vital
patterns
of
burning
beauty
down
the
narrow
branching
paths
that
led
to
inner
mysteries
the
light
ran
in
and
out
peeping
between
the
divided
leaves
of
plants
gliding
over
the
slippery
edges
of
the
palm
branches
trembling
airily
where
the
papyrus
bent
its
antique
head
dancing
among
the
big
blades
of
sturdy
grass
that
sprouted
in
tufts
here
and
there
resting
languidly
upon
the
glistening
magnolias
that
were
besieged
by
somnolent
bees
all
the
greens
and
all
the
golds
of
creation
were
surely
met
together
in
this
profound
retreat
to
prove
the
perfect
harmony
of
earth
with
sun
and
now
growing
accustomed
to
the
pervading
silence
domini
began
to
hear
the
tiny
sounds
that
broke
it
they
came
from
the
trees
and
plants
the
airs
were
always
astir
helping
the
soft
designs
of
nature
loosening
a
leaf
from
its
stem
and
bearing
it
to
the
sand
striking
a
berry
from
its
place
and
causing
it
to
drop
at
domini
s
feet
giving
a
faded
geranium
petal
the
courage
to
leave
its
more
vivid
companions
and
resign
itself
to
the
loss
of
the
place
it
could
no
longer
fill
with
beauty
very
delicate
was
the
touch
of
the
dying
upon
the
yellow
sand
it
increased
the
sense
of
pervading
mystery
and
made
domini
more
deeply
conscious
of
the
pulsing
life
of
the
garden
there
is
the
room
of
the
little
dog
said
smain
they
had
come
out
into
a
small
open
space
over
which
an
immense
cocoanut
tree
presided
low
box
hedges
ran
round
two
squares
of
grass
which
were
shadowed
by
date
palms
heavy
with
yellow
fruit
and
beneath
some
leaning
mulberry
trees
domini
saw
a
tiny
white
room
with
two
glass
windows
down
to
the
ground
she
went
up
to
it
and
peeped
in
smiling
there
in
a
formal
salon
with
gilt
chairs
oval
polished
tables
faded
rugs
and
shining
mirrors
sat
a
purple
china
dog
with
his
tail
curled
over
his
back
sternly
staring
into
vacancy
his
expression
and
his
attitude
were
autocratic
and
determined
betokening
a
tyrannical
nature
and
domini
peeped
at
him
with
precaution
holding
herself
very
still
lest
he
should
become
aware
of
her
presence
and
resent
it
monsieur
the
count
paid
much
money
for
the
dog
murmured
smain
he
is
very
how
long
has
he
been
there
for
many
years
he
was
there
when
i
was
born
and
i
have
been
married
twice
and
divorced
domini
turned
from
the
window
and
looked
at
smain
with
astonishment
he
was
smelling
his
rose
like
a
dreamy
child
you
have
been
divorced
twice
yes
now
i
will
show
madame
the
they
followed
another
of
the
innumerable
alleys
of
the
garden
this
one
was
very
narrow
and
less
densely
roofed
with
trees
than
those
they
had
already
traversed
tall
shrubs
bent
forward
on
either
side
of
it
and
their
small
leaves
almost
meeting
were
transformed
by
the
radiant
sunbeams
into
tongues
of
pale
fire
quivering
well
nigh
transparent
as
she
approached
them
domini
could
not
resist
the
fancy
that
they
would
burn
her
a
brown
butterfly
flitted
forward
between
them
and
vanished
into
the
golden
dream
beyond
oh
smain
how
you
must
love
this
garden
she
said
a
sort
of
ecstasy
was
waking
within
her
the
pure
air
the
caressing
warmth
the
enchanted
stillness
and
privacy
of
this
domain
touched
her
soul
and
body
like
the
hands
of
a
saint
with
power
to
bless
her
i
could
live
here
for
ever
she
added
without
once
wishing
to
go
out
into
the
smain
looked
drowsily
pleased
we
are
coming
to
the
centre
of
the
garden
he
said
as
they
passed
over
a
bridge
beneath
which
a
stream
glided
under
the
red
petals
of
geraniums
the
tongues
of
flame
were
left
behind
green
darkness
closed
in
upon
them
and
the
sand
beneath
their
feet
looked
blanched
the
sense
of
mystery
increased
for
the
trees
were
enormous
and
grew
densely
here
pine
needles
lay
upon
the
ground
and
there
was
a
stirring
of
sudden
wind
far
up
above
their
heads
in
the
this
is
the
part
of
the
garden
that
monsieur
the
count
loves
said
smain
he
comes
here
every
what
is
that
said
domini
suddenly
stopping
on
the
pale
sand
a
thin
and
remote
sound
stole
to
them
down
the
alley
clear
and
frail
as
the
note
of
a
night
bird
it
is
larbi
playing
upon
the
flute
he
is
in
love
that
is
why
he
plays
when
he
ought
to
be
watering
the
flowers
and
raking
out
the
the
distant
of
the
flute
seemed
to
domini
the
last
touch
of
enchantment
making
this
indeed
a
wonderland
she
could
not
move
and
held
up
her
hands
to
stay
the
feet
of
smain
who
was
quite
content
to
wait
never
before
had
she
heard
any
music
that
seemed
to
mean
and
suggest
so
much
to
her
as
this
african
tune
played
by
an
enamoured
gardener
queer
and
uncouth
as
it
was
distorted
with
ornaments
and
tricked
out
with
abrupt
runs
exquisitely
unnecessary
grace
notes
and
sudden
twitterings
prolonged
till
a
strange
and
frivolous
eternity
tripped
in
to
banish
time
it
grasped
domini
s
fancy
and
laid
a
spell
upon
her
imagination
for
it
sounded
as
naively
sincere
as
the
song
of
a
bird
and
as
if
the
heart
from
which
it
flowed
were
like
the
heart
of
a
child
a
place
of
revelation
not
of
concealment
the
sun
made
men
careless
here
they
opened
their
windows
to
it
and
one
could
see
into
the
warm
and
glowing
rooms
domini
looked
at
the
gentle
arab
youth
beside
her
already
twice
married
and
twice
divorced
she
listened
to
larbi
s
unending
song
of
love
and
she
said
to
herself
these
people
uncivilised
or
not
at
least
live
and
i
have
been
dead
all
my
life
dead
in
that
was
horribly
possible
she
knew
it
as
she
felt
the
enormously
powerful
spell
of
africa
descending
upon
her
enveloping
her
quietly
but
irresistibly
the
dream
of
this
garden
was
quick
with
a
vague
and
yet
fierce
stirring
of
realities
there
was
a
murmuring
of
many
small
and
distant
voices
like
the
voices
of
innumerable
tiny
things
following
restless
activities
in
a
deep
forest
as
she
stood
there
the
last
grain
of
european
dust
was
lifted
from
domini
s
soul
how
deeply
it
had
been
buried
and
for
how
many
years
the
greatest
act
of
man
is
the
act
of
she
had
just
heard
those
words
the
eyes
of
the
priest
had
flamed
as
he
spoke
them
and
she
had
caught
the
spark
of
his
enthusiasm
but
now
another
fire
seemed
lit
within
her
and
she
found
herself
marvelling
at
such
austerity
was
it
not
a
fanatical
defiance
flung
into
the
face
of
the
sun
she
shrank
from
her
own
thought
like
one
startled
and
walked
on
softly
in
the
green
darkness
larbi
s
flute
became
more
distant
again
and
again
it
repeated
the
same
queer
little
melody
changing
the
ornamentation
at
the
fantasy
of
the
player
she
looked
for
him
among
the
trees
but
saw
no
one
he
must
be
in
some
very
secret
place
smain
touched
her
look
he
said
and
his
voice
was
very
low
he
parted
the
branches
of
some
palms
with
his
delicate
hands
and
domini
peering
between
them
saw
in
a
place
of
deep
shadows
an
isolated
square
room
whose
white
walls
were
almost
entirely
concealed
by
masses
of
purple
bougainvillea
it
had
a
flat
roof
in
three
of
its
sides
were
large
arched
without
windows
in
the
fourth
was
a
narrow
doorway
without
a
door
immense
fig
trees
and
palms
and
thickets
of
bamboo
towered
around
it
and
leaned
above
it
and
it
was
circled
by
a
narrow
riband
of
sand
that
is
the
of
monsieur
the
count
said
smain
he
spends
many
hours
there
come
and
i
will
show
the
inside
to
they
turned
to
the
left
and
went
towards
the
room
the
flute
was
close
to
them
now
larbi
must
be
in
there
domini
whispered
to
smain
as
a
person
whispers
in
a
church
no
he
is
among
the
trees
but
someone
is
she
pointed
to
the
arched
nearest
to
them
a
thin
spiral
of
smoke
curled
through
it
and
evaporated
into
the
shadows
of
the
trees
after
a
moment
it
was
followed
gently
and
deliberately
by
another
it
is
not
larbi
he
would
not
go
in
there
it
must
be
he
paused
a
tall
man
had
come
to
the
doorway
of
the
little
room
and
looked
out
into
the
garden
with
bright
eyes
chapter
vi
domini
drew
back
and
glanced
at
smain
she
was
not
accustomed
to
feeling
intrusive
and
the
sudden
sensation
rendered
her
uneasy
it
is
monsieur
the
count
smain
said
calmly
and
quite
aloud
the
man
in
the
doorway
took
off
his
soft
hat
as
if
the
words
effected
an
introduction
between
domini
and
him
you
were
coming
to
see
my
little
room
madame
he
said
in
french
if
i
may
show
it
to
you
i
shall
feel
the
timbre
of
his
voice
was
harsh
and
grating
yet
it
was
a
very
interesting
even
a
seductive
voice
and
domini
thought
peculiarly
full
of
vivid
life
though
not
of
energy
his
manner
at
once
banished
her
momentary
discomfort
there
is
a
freemasonry
between
people
born
in
the
same
social
world
by
the
way
in
which
count
anteoni
took
off
his
hat
and
spoke
she
knew
at
once
that
all
was
right
thank
you
monsieur
she
answered
i
was
told
at
the
gate
you
gave
permission
to
travellers
to
visit
your
he
spoke
a
few
words
in
fluent
arabic
to
smain
who
turned
away
and
disappeared
among
the
trees
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
accompany
you
through
the
rest
of
the
garden
he
said
turning
again
to
domini
it
will
give
me
great
it
is
very
kind
of
the
way
in
which
the
change
of
companion
had
been
effected
made
it
seem
a
pleasant
inevitable
courtesy
which
neither
implied
nor
demanded
anything
this
is
my
little
retreat
count
anteoni
continued
standing
aside
from
the
doorway
that
domini
might
enter
she
drew
a
long
breath
when
she
was
within
the
floor
was
of
fine
sand
beaten
flat
and
hard
and
strewn
with
eastern
rugs
of
faint
and
delicate
hues
dim
greens
and
faded
rose
colours
and
misty
topaz
yellows
round
the
white
walls
ran
broad
divans
also
white
covered
with
prayer
rugs
from
bagdad
and
large
cushions
elaborately
worked
in
dull
gold
and
silver
thread
with
patterns
of
ibises
and
flamingoes
in
flight
in
the
four
angles
of
the
room
stood
four
tiny
of
rough
palm
wood
holding
hammered
of
bronze
green
bronze
torches
for
the
lighting
of
cigarettes
and
vases
of
chinese
dragon
china
filled
with
velvety
red
roses
gardenias
and
sprigs
of
orange
blossom
leather
footstools
covered
with
tunisian
lay
beside
them
from
the
arches
of
the
hung
old
moorish
lamps
of
copper
fitted
with
small
panes
of
dull
jewelled
glass
such
as
may
be
seen
in
venerable
church
windows
in
a
round
copper
brazier
set
on
one
of
the
incense
twigs
were
drowsily
burning
and
giving
out
thin
dwarf
columns
of
scented
smoke
through
the
archways
and
the
narrow
doorway
the
dense
walls
of
leafage
were
visible
standing
on
guard
about
this
airy
hermitage
and
the
hot
purple
blossoms
of
the
bougainvillea
shed
a
cloud
of
colour
through
the
bosky
dimness
and
still
the
flute
of
larbi
showered
soft
clear
whimsical
music
from
some
hidden
place
close
by
domini
looked
at
her
host
who
was
standing
by
the
doorway
leaning
one
arm
against
the
wall
this
is
my
first
day
in
africa
she
said
simply
you
may
imagine
what
i
think
of
your
garden
what
i
feel
in
it
i
needn
t
tell
you
indeed
i
am
sure
the
travellers
you
so
kindly
let
in
must
often
have
worried
you
with
their
no
he
answered
with
a
still
gravity
which
yet
suggested
kindness
for
i
leave
nearly
always
before
the
travellers
come
that
sounds
a
little
rude
but
you
would
not
be
in
at
this
season
madame
if
it
could
include
i
have
come
here
for
peace
domini
replied
simply
she
said
it
because
she
felt
as
if
it
was
already
understood
by
her
companion
count
anteoni
took
down
his
arm
from
the
white
wall
and
pulled
a
branch
of
the
purple
flowers
slowly
towards
him
through
the
doorway
there
is
peace
what
is
generally
called
so
at
least
in
he
answered
rather
slowly
and
meditatively
that
is
to
say
there
is
similarity
of
day
with
day
night
with
night
the
sun
shines
untiringly
over
the
desert
and
the
desert
always
hints
at
he
let
the
flowers
go
and
they
sprang
softly
back
and
hung
quivering
in
the
space
beyond
his
thin
figure
then
he
added
perhaps
one
should
not
say
more
than
domini
sat
down
for
a
moment
she
looked
up
at
him
with
her
direct
eyes
and
at
the
shaking
flowers
the
sound
of
larbi
s
flute
was
always
in
her
ears
but
may
not
one
think
feel
a
little
more
she
asked
oh
why
not
if
one
can
if
one
must
but
how
africa
is
as
fierce
and
full
of
meaning
as
a
furnace
you
yes
i
know
already
she
replied
his
words
expressed
what
she
had
already
felt
here
in
surreptitiously
and
yet
powerfully
he
said
it
and
last
night
the
african
hautboy
had
said
it
peace
and
a
flame
could
they
exist
together
blended
married
africa
seems
to
me
to
agree
through
contradiction
she
added
smiling
a
little
and
touching
the
snowy
wall
with
her
right
hand
but
then
this
is
my
first
mine
was
when
i
was
a
boy
of
this
garden
wasn
t
here
then
no
i
had
it
made
i
came
here
with
my
mother
she
spoilt
me
she
let
me
have
my
this
garden
is
your
boy
s
whim
it
was
now
it
is
a
man
s
he
seemed
to
hesitate
paradise
suggested
domini
i
think
i
was
going
to
say
there
was
no
bitterness
in
his
odd
ugly
voice
yet
surely
the
words
implied
bitterness
the
wounded
the
fearful
the
disappointed
the
condemned
hide
perhaps
he
remembered
this
for
he
added
rather
quickly
i
come
here
to
be
foolish
madame
for
i
come
here
to
think
this
is
my
special
thinking
how
strange
domini
exclaimed
impulsively
and
leaning
forward
on
the
divan
is
it
i
only
mean
that
already
has
seemed
to
me
the
ideal
place
for
for
thought
for
finding
out
interior
count
anteoni
looked
at
her
rather
swiftly
and
searchingly
his
eyes
were
not
large
but
they
were
bright
and
held
none
of
the
languor
so
often
seen
in
the
eyes
of
his
countrymen
his
face
was
expressive
through
its
mobility
rather
than
through
its
contours
the
features
were
small
and
refined
not
noble
but
unmistakably
aristocratic
the
nose
was
sensitive
with
wide
nostrils
a
long
and
straight
moustache
turning
slightly
grey
did
not
hide
the
mouth
which
had
unusually
pale
lips
the
ears
were
set
very
flat
against
the
head
and
were
finely
shaped
the
chin
was
pointed
the
general
look
of
the
whole
face
was
tense
critical
conscious
but
in
the
defiant
rather
than
in
the
timid
sense
such
an
expression
belongs
to
men
who
would
always
be
aware
of
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
others
concerning
them
but
who
would
throw
those
thoughts
and
feelings
off
as
decisively
and
energetically
as
a
dog
shakes
the
waterdrops
from
its
coat
on
emerging
from
a
swim
and
sending
it
forth
like
ishmael
to
shift
for
itself
in
the
desert
he
said
the
odd
remark
sounded
like
neither
statement
nor
question
merely
like
the
sudden
exclamation
of
a
mind
at
work
will
you
allow
me
to
take
you
through
the
rest
of
the
garden
madame
he
added
in
a
more
formal
voice
thank
you
said
domini
who
had
already
got
up
moved
by
the
examining
look
cast
at
her
there
was
nothing
in
it
to
resent
and
she
had
not
resented
it
but
it
had
recalled
her
to
the
consciousness
that
they
were
utter
strangers
to
each
other
as
they
came
out
on
the
pale
riband
of
sand
which
circled
the
little
room
domini
said
how
wild
and
extraordinary
that
tune
is
larbi
s
i
suppose
it
is
but
no
african
music
seems
strange
to
me
i
was
born
on
my
father
s
estate
near
tunis
he
was
a
sicilian
but
came
to
north
africa
each
winter
i
have
always
heard
the
tomtoms
and
the
pipes
and
i
know
nearly
all
the
desert
songs
of
the
this
is
a
isn
t
it
yes
larbi
is
always
in
love
they
tell
me
each
new
dancer
catches
him
in
her
net
happy
larbi
because
he
can
love
so
easily
or
unlove
so
easily
look
at
him
at
a
little
distance
under
a
big
banana
tree
and
half
hidden
by
clumps
of
scarlet
geraniums
domini
saw
a
huge
and
very
ugly
arab
with
an
almost
black
skin
squatting
on
his
heels
with
a
long
yellow
and
red
flute
between
his
thick
lips
his
eyes
were
bent
down
and
he
did
not
see
them
but
went
on
busily
playing
drawing
from
his
flute
coquettish
phrases
with
his
big
and
bony
fingers
and
i
pay
him
so
much
a
week
all
the
year
round
for
doing
that
the
count
said
his
grating
voice
sounded
kind
and
amused
they
walked
on
and
larbi
s
tune
died
gradually
away
somehow
i
can
t
be
angry
with
the
follies
and
vices
of
the
arabs
the
count
continued
i
love
them
as
they
are
idle
absurdly
amorous
quick
to
shed
blood
gay
as
children
whimsical
as
well
madame
were
i
talking
to
a
man
i
might
dare
to
say
pretty
why
not
i
will
then
i
glory
in
their
ingrained
contempt
of
civilisation
but
i
like
them
to
say
their
prayers
five
times
in
the
day
as
it
is
commanded
and
no
arab
who
touches
alcohol
in
defiance
of
the
prophet
s
law
sets
foot
in
my
there
was
a
touch
of
harshness
in
his
voice
as
he
said
the
last
words
the
sound
of
the
autocrat
somehow
domini
liked
it
this
man
had
convictions
and
strong
ones
that
was
certain
there
was
something
oddly
unconventional
in
him
which
something
in
her
responded
to
he
was
perfectly
polite
and
yet
she
was
quite
sure
absolutely
careless
of
opinion
certainly
he
was
very
much
a
man
it
is
pleasant
too
he
resumed
after
a
slight
pause
to
be
surrounded
by
absolutely
thoughtless
people
with
thoughtful
faces
and
mysterious
eyes
wells
without
truth
at
the
bottom
of
she
laughed
no
one
must
think
here
but
you
i
prefer
to
keep
all
the
folly
to
myself
is
not
that
a
grand
cocoanut
he
pointed
to
a
tree
so
tall
that
it
seemed
soaring
to
heaven
yes
indeed
like
the
one
that
presides
over
the
purple
you
have
seen
my
fetish
smain
showed
him
to
me
with
oh
he
is
king
here
the
arabs
declare
that
on
moonlight
nights
they
have
heard
him
joining
in
the
chorus
of
the
kabyle
you
speak
almost
as
if
you
believed
well
i
believe
more
here
than
i
believe
anywhere
else
that
is
partly
why
i
come
i
can
understand
that
i
mean
believing
much
what
already
you
feel
the
spell
of
the
desert
spell
yes
there
is
enchantment
here
and
so
i
never
stay
too
for
fear
of
what
count
anteoni
was
walking
easily
beside
her
he
walked
from
the
hips
like
many
sicilians
swaying
very
slightly
as
if
he
liked
to
be
aware
how
supple
his
body
still
was
as
domini
spoke
he
stopped
they
were
now
at
a
place
where
four
paths
joined
and
could
see
four
vistas
of
green
and
gold
of
magical
sunlight
and
shadow
i
scarcely
know
of
being
carried
who
knows
where
in
mind
or
heart
oh
there
is
danger
in
madame
there
is
danger
this
startling
air
is
full
of
influences
of
desert
he
looked
at
her
in
a
way
she
could
not
understand
but
it
made
her
think
of
the
in
his
little
dark
room
and
of
the
sudden
sensation
she
had
had
that
mystery
coils
like
a
black
serpent
in
the
shining
heart
of
the
east
and
now
madame
which
path
shall
we
take
this
one
leads
to
my
that
on
the
right
to
the
moorish
and
that
that
one
goes
straight
down
to
the
wall
that
overlooks
the
please
let
us
take
the
desert
spirits
are
calling
to
you
but
you
are
wise
what
makes
this
garden
remarkable
is
not
its
arrangement
the
number
and
variety
of
its
trees
but
the
fact
that
it
lies
flush
with
the
sahara
like
a
man
s
thoughts
of
truth
with
truth
he
turned
up
the
tail
of
the
sentence
and
his
harsh
voice
gave
a
little
grating
crack
i
don
t
believe
they
are
so
different
from
one
another
as
the
garden
and
the
she
looked
at
him
directly
it
would
be
too
but
nothing
is
the
count
said
you
have
discovered
that
in
this
garden
ah
it
is
new
to
you
madame
for
the
first
time
there
was
a
sound
of
faint
bitterness
in
his
voice
one
often
discovers
the
saddest
thing
in
the
loveliest
place
he
added
there
you
begin
to
see
the
far
away
at
the
small
orifice
of
the
tunnel
of
trees
down
which
they
were
walking
appeared
a
glaring
patch
of
fierce
and
quivering
sunlight
i
can
only
see
the
sun
domini
said
i
know
so
well
what
it
hides
that
i
imagine
i
actually
see
the
desert
one
loves
one
s
kind
assiduous
liar
isn
t
it
so
the
imagination
but
perhaps
i
am
not
disposed
to
allow
that
it
is
a
who
knows
you
may
be
he
looked
at
her
kindly
with
his
bright
eyes
it
had
not
seem
to
strike
him
that
their
conversation
was
curiously
intimate
considering
that
they
were
strangers
to
one
another
that
he
did
not
even
know
her
name
domini
wondered
suddenly
how
old
he
was
that
look
made
him
seem
much
older
than
he
had
seemed
before
there
was
such
an
expression
in
his
eyes
as
may
sometimes
be
seen
in
eyes
that
look
at
a
child
who
is
kissing
a
rag
doll
with
deep
and
determined
affection
kiss
your
doll
they
seemed
to
say
put
off
the
years
when
you
must
know
that
dolls
can
never
return
a
i
begin
to
see
the
desert
now
domini
said
after
a
moment
of
silent
walking
how
wonderful
it
is
yes
it
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
nature
you
will
think
it
much
more
wonderful
when
you
fancy
you
know
it
fancy
i
don
t
think
anyone
can
ever
really
know
the
desert
it
is
the
thing
that
keeps
calling
and
does
not
permit
one
to
draw
but
then
one
might
learn
to
hate
i
don
t
think
so
truth
does
just
the
same
you
know
and
yet
men
keep
on
trying
to
draw
but
sometimes
they
do
they
not
when
they
live
in
he
laughed
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
been
together
and
all
his
face
was
covered
with
a
network
of
little
moving
lines
one
should
never
live
in
a
garden
i
will
try
to
take
your
word
for
it
but
the
task
will
be
yes
more
difficult
perhaps
when
you
see
what
lies
beside
my
thoughts
of
as
he
spoke
they
came
out
from
the
tunnel
and
were
seized
by
the
fierce
hands
of
the
sun
it
was
within
half
an
hour
of
noon
and
the
radiance
was
blinding
domini
put
up
her
parasol
sharply
like
one
startled
she
stopped
but
how
tremendous
she
exclaimed
count
anteoni
laughed
again
and
drew
down
the
brim
of
his
grey
hat
over
his
eyes
the
hand
with
which
he
did
it
was
almost
as
burnt
as
an
arab
s
you
are
afraid
of
it
no
no
but
it
startled
me
we
don
t
know
the
sun
really
in
no
not
even
in
southern
italy
not
even
in
sicily
it
is
fierce
there
in
summer
but
it
seems
further
away
here
it
insists
on
the
most
intense
intimacy
if
you
can
bear
it
we
might
sit
down
for
a
moment
all
along
the
edge
of
the
garden
from
the
villa
to
the
boundary
of
count
anteoni
s
domain
ran
a
straight
high
wall
made
of
earth
bricks
hardened
by
the
sun
and
topped
by
a
coping
of
palm
wood
painted
white
this
wall
was
some
eight
feet
high
on
the
side
next
to
the
desert
but
the
garden
was
raised
in
such
a
way
that
the
inner
side
was
merely
a
low
parapet
running
along
the
sand
path
in
this
parapet
were
cut
small
seats
like
in
which
one
could
rest
and
look
full
upon
the
desert
as
from
a
little
cliff
domini
sat
down
on
one
of
them
and
the
count
stood
by
her
resting
one
foot
on
the
top
of
the
wall
and
leaning
his
right
arm
on
his
knee
there
is
the
world
on
which
i
look
for
my
he
said
a
vast
world
isn
t
it
domini
nodded
without
speaking
immediately
beneath
them
in
the
narrow
shadow
of
the
wall
was
a
path
of
earth
and
stones
which
turned
off
at
the
right
at
the
end
of
the
garden
into
the
oasis
beyond
lay
the
vast
river
bed
a
chaos
of
hot
boulders
bounded
by
ragged
low
earth
cliffs
interspersed
here
and
there
with
small
pools
of
gleaming
water
these
cliffs
were
yellow
from
their
edge
stretched
the
desert
as
eternity
stretches
from
the
edge
of
time
only
to
the
left
was
the
immeasurable
expanse
intruded
upon
by
a
long
spur
of
mountains
which
ran
out
boldly
for
some
distance
and
then
stopped
abruptly
conquered
and
abashed
by
the
imperious
flats
beneath
the
mountains
were
low
undulations
which
reminded
domini
of
those
made
by
a
sheet
one
smaller
than
the
other
till
they
melted
into
the
level
the
summits
of
the
most
distant
mountains
which
leaned
away
as
if
in
fear
of
the
desert
were
dark
and
mistily
purple
their
flanks
were
iron
grey
at
this
hour
flecked
in
the
hollows
with
the
faint
mauve
and
pink
which
became
carnation
colour
when
the
sun
set
domini
scarcely
looked
at
them
till
now
she
had
always
thought
that
she
loved
mountains
the
desert
suddenly
made
them
insignificant
almost
mean
to
her
she
turned
her
eyes
towards
the
flat
spaces
it
was
in
them
that
majesty
lay
mystery
power
and
all
deep
and
significant
things
in
the
midst
of
the
river
bed
and
quite
near
rose
a
round
and
squat
white
tower
with
a
small
cupola
beyond
it
on
the
little
cliff
was
a
tangle
of
palms
where
a
tiny
oasis
sheltered
a
few
native
huts
at
an
immense
distance
here
and
there
other
oases
showed
as
dark
stains
show
on
the
sea
where
there
are
hidden
rocks
and
still
farther
away
on
all
hands
the
desert
seemed
to
curve
up
slightly
like
a
shallow
cup
to
the
misty
blue
horizon
line
which
resembled
a
faintly
seen
and
mysterious
tropical
sea
so
distant
that
its
sultry
murmur
was
lost
in
the
embrace
of
the
intervening
silence
an
arab
passed
on
the
path
below
the
wall
he
did
not
see
them
a
white
dog
with
curling
lips
ran
beside
him
he
was
singing
to
himself
in
a
low
inward
voice
he
went
on
and
turned
towards
the
oasis
still
singing
as
he
walked
slowly
do
you
know
what
he
is
singing
the
count
asked
domini
shook
her
head
she
was
straining
her
ears
to
hear
the
melody
as
long
as
possible
it
is
a
desert
song
of
the
freed
negroes
of
touggourt
no
one
but
god
and
i
knows
what
is
in
my
domini
lowered
her
parasol
to
conceal
her
face
in
the
distance
she
could
still
hear
the
song
but
it
was
dying
away
oh
what
is
going
to
happen
to
me
here
she
thought
count
anteoni
was
looking
away
from
her
now
across
the
desert
a
strange
impulse
rose
up
in
her
she
could
not
resist
it
she
put
down
her
parasol
exposing
herself
to
the
blinding
sunlight
knelt
down
on
the
hot
sand
leaned
her
arms
on
the
white
parapet
put
her
chin
in
the
upturned
palms
of
her
hands
and
stared
into
the
desert
almost
fiercely
no
one
but
god
and
i
knows
what
is
in
my
heart
she
thought
but
that
s
not
true
that
s
not
true
for
i
don
t
the
last
echo
of
the
arab
s
song
fainted
on
the
blazing
air
surely
it
had
changed
now
surely
as
he
turned
into
the
shadows
of
the
palms
he
was
singing
no
one
but
god
knows
what
is
in
my
yes
he
was
singing
that
no
one
but
god
no
one
but
count
anteoni
looked
down
at
her
she
did
not
notice
it
and
he
kept
his
eyes
on
her
for
a
moment
then
he
turned
to
the
desert
again
by
degrees
as
she
watched
domini
became
aware
of
many
things
indicative
of
life
and
of
many
lives
in
the
tremendous
expanse
that
at
first
had
seemed
empty
of
all
save
sun
and
mystery
she
saw
low
scattered
tents
columns
of
smoke
rising
she
saw
a
bird
pass
across
the
blue
and
vanish
towards
the
mountains
black
shapes
appeared
among
the
tiny
mounds
of
earth
crowned
with
dusty
grass
and
dwarf
tamarisk
bushes
she
saw
them
move
like
objects
in
a
dream
slowly
through
the
shimmering
gold
they
were
feeding
camels
guarded
by
nomads
whom
she
could
not
see
at
first
she
persistently
explored
the
distances
carried
forcibly
by
an
of
her
whole
nature
to
the
remotest
points
her
eyes
could
reach
then
she
withdrew
her
gaze
gradually
reluctantly
from
the
hidden
summoning
lands
whose
verges
she
had
with
difficulty
gained
and
looked
at
first
with
apprehension
upon
the
nearer
regions
but
her
apprehension
died
when
she
found
that
the
desert
transmutes
what
is
close
as
well
as
what
is
remote
suffuses
even
that
which
the
hand
could
almost
touch
with
wonder
beauty
and
the
deepest
most
strange
significance
quite
near
in
the
river
bed
she
saw
an
arab
riding
towards
the
desert
upon
a
prancing
black
horse
he
mounted
a
steep
bit
of
path
and
came
out
on
the
flat
ground
at
the
cliff
top
then
he
set
his
horse
at
a
gallop
raising
his
bridle
hand
and
striking
his
heels
into
the
flanks
of
the
beast
and
each
of
his
movements
each
of
the
movements
of
his
horse
was
profoundly
interesting
and
held
the
attention
of
the
onlooker
in
a
vice
as
if
the
fates
of
worlds
depended
upon
where
he
was
carried
and
how
soon
he
reached
his
goal
a
string
of
camels
laden
with
wooden
bales
met
him
on
the
way
and
this
chance
encounter
seemed
to
domini
fraught
with
almost
terrible
possibilities
why
she
did
not
ask
herself
again
she
sent
her
gaze
further
to
the
black
shapes
moving
stealthily
among
the
little
mounds
to
the
spirals
of
smoke
rising
into
the
glimmering
air
who
guarded
those
camels
who
fed
those
distant
fires
who
watched
beside
them
it
seemed
of
vital
consequence
to
her
that
she
should
know
count
anteoni
took
out
his
watch
and
glanced
at
it
i
am
looking
to
see
if
it
is
nearly
the
hour
of
prayer
he
said
when
i
am
in
i
usually
come
here
you
turn
to
the
desert
as
the
faithful
turn
towards
mecca
yes
i
like
to
see
men
praying
in
the
he
spoke
indifferently
but
domini
felt
suddenly
sure
that
within
him
there
were
depths
of
imagination
of
tenderness
even
perhaps
of
mysticism
an
atheist
in
the
desert
is
unimaginable
he
added
in
cathedrals
they
may
exist
very
likely
and
even
feel
at
home
i
have
seen
cathedrals
in
which
i
could
believe
i
was
one
but
how
many
human
beings
can
you
see
in
the
desert
at
this
moment
madame
domini
still
with
her
round
chin
in
her
hands
searched
the
blazing
region
with
her
eyes
she
saw
three
running
figures
with
the
train
of
camels
which
was
now
descending
into
the
river
bed
in
the
shadow
of
the
low
white
tower
two
more
were
huddled
motionless
she
looked
away
to
right
and
left
but
saw
only
the
shallow
pools
the
hot
and
gleaming
boulders
and
beyond
the
yellow
cliffs
the
brown
huts
peeping
through
the
palms
the
horseman
had
disappeared
i
can
see
five
she
answered
ah
you
are
not
accustomed
to
the
there
are
more
i
could
count
up
to
a
dozen
which
are
yours
the
men
with
the
camels
and
the
men
under
that
there
are
four
playing
the
des
in
the
shadow
of
the
cliff
opposite
to
us
there
is
one
asleep
under
a
red
rock
where
the
path
ascends
into
the
desert
and
there
are
two
more
just
at
the
edge
of
the
little
oasis
filiash
as
it
is
called
one
is
standing
under
a
palm
and
one
is
pacing
up
and
you
must
have
splendid
they
are
trained
to
the
desert
but
there
are
probably
a
score
of
arabs
within
sight
whom
i
don
t
oh
now
i
see
the
men
at
the
edge
of
the
oasis
how
oddly
that
one
is
moving
he
goes
up
and
down
like
a
sailor
on
the
yes
it
is
curious
and
he
is
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
sun
that
can
t
be
an
he
drew
a
silver
whistle
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
put
it
to
his
lips
and
sounded
a
call
in
a
moment
smain
same
running
lightly
over
the
sand
count
anteoni
said
something
to
him
in
arabic
he
disappeared
and
speedily
returned
with
a
pair
of
while
he
was
gone
domini
watched
the
two
figures
on
the
cliff
in
silence
one
was
standing
under
a
large
isolated
palm
tree
absolutely
still
as
arabs
often
stand
the
other
at
a
short
distance
from
him
and
full
in
the
sun
went
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
always
measuring
the
same
space
of
desert
and
turning
and
returning
at
two
given
points
which
never
varied
he
walked
like
a
man
hemmed
in
by
walls
yet
around
him
were
the
infinite
spaces
the
effect
was
singularly
unpleasant
upon
domini
all
things
in
the
desert
as
she
had
already
noticed
became
almost
terribly
significant
and
this
peculiar
activity
seemed
full
of
some
extraordinary
and
even
horrible
meaning
she
watched
it
with
straining
eyes
count
anteoni
took
the
glasses
from
smain
and
looked
through
them
adjusting
them
carefully
to
suit
his
sight
he
said
i
was
right
that
man
is
not
an
he
moved
the
glasses
and
glanced
at
domini
you
are
not
the
only
traveller
here
he
looked
through
the
glasses
again
i
knew
that
she
said
indeed
there
is
one
at
my
possibly
this
is
he
he
makes
me
think
of
a
caged
tiger
who
has
been
so
long
in
captivity
that
when
you
let
him
out
he
still
imagines
the
bars
to
be
all
round
him
what
was
he
like
all
the
time
he
was
speaking
he
was
staring
intently
through
the
glasses
as
domini
did
not
reply
he
removed
them
from
his
eyes
and
glanced
at
her
inquiringly
i
am
trying
to
think
what
he
looked
like
she
said
slowly
but
i
feel
that
i
don
t
know
he
was
quite
unlike
any
ordinary
would
you
care
to
see
if
you
can
recognise
him
these
are
really
marvellous
domini
took
them
from
him
with
some
eagerness
twist
them
about
till
they
suit
your
at
first
she
could
see
nothing
but
a
fierce
yellow
glare
she
turned
the
screw
and
gradually
the
desert
came
to
her
startlingly
distinct
the
boulders
of
the
river
bed
were
enormous
she
could
see
the
veins
of
colour
in
them
a
lizard
running
over
one
of
them
and
disappearing
into
a
dark
crevice
then
the
white
tower
and
the
arabs
beneath
it
one
was
an
old
man
yawning
the
other
a
boy
he
rubbed
the
tip
of
his
brown
nose
and
she
saw
the
henna
stains
upon
his
nails
she
lifted
the
glasses
slowly
and
with
precaution
the
tower
ran
away
she
came
to
the
low
cliff
to
the
brown
huts
and
the
palms
passed
them
one
by
one
and
reached
the
last
which
was
separated
from
its
companions
under
it
stood
a
tall
arab
in
a
garment
like
a
white
he
looks
as
if
he
had
only
one
eye
she
exclaimed
the
man
she
travelled
cautiously
away
from
him
keeping
the
glasses
level
ah
she
said
on
an
indrawn
breath
as
she
spoke
the
thin
nasal
cry
of
a
distant
voice
broke
upon
her
ears
prolonging
a
strange
call
the
mueddin
said
count
anteoni
and
he
repeated
in
a
low
tone
the
words
of
the
angel
to
the
prophet
oh
thou
that
art
covered
arise
and
magnify
thy
lord
and
purify
thy
clothes
and
depart
from
the
call
died
away
and
was
renewed
three
times
the
old
man
and
the
boy
beneath
the
tower
turned
their
faces
towards
mecca
fell
upon
their
knees
and
bowed
their
heads
to
the
hot
stones
the
tall
arab
under
the
palm
sank
down
swiftly
domini
kept
the
glasses
at
her
eyes
through
them
as
in
a
sort
of
exaggerated
vision
very
far
off
yet
intensely
distinct
she
saw
the
man
with
whom
she
had
travelled
in
the
train
he
went
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
on
the
burning
ground
till
the
fourth
call
of
the
mueddin
died
away
then
as
he
approached
the
isolated
palm
tree
and
saw
the
arab
beneath
it
fall
to
the
earth
and
bow
his
long
body
in
prayer
he
paused
and
stood
still
as
if
in
contemplation
the
glasses
were
so
powerful
that
it
was
possible
to
see
the
expressions
on
faces
even
at
that
distance
the
expression
on
the
traveller
s
face
was
or
seemed
to
be
at
first
one
of
profound
attention
but
this
changed
swiftly
as
he
watched
the
bowing
figure
and
was
succeeded
by
a
look
of
uneasiness
then
of
fierce
disgust
then
surely
of
fear
or
horror
he
turned
sharply
away
like
a
driven
man
and
hurried
off
along
the
cliff
edge
in
a
striding
walk
quickening
his
steps
each
moment
till
his
departure
became
a
flight
he
disappeared
behind
a
projection
of
earth
where
the
path
sank
to
the
river
bed
domini
laid
the
glasses
down
on
the
wall
and
looked
at
count
anteoni
you
say
an
atheist
in
the
desert
is
unimaginable
isn
t
it
true
has
an
atheist
a
hatred
a
horror
of
prayer
chi
lo
sa
the
devil
shrank
away
from
the
lifted
because
he
knew
how
much
that
was
true
it
no
doubt
had
it
been
otherwise
he
would
have
jeered
not
cowered
but
why
do
you
ask
me
this
question
madame
i
have
just
seen
a
man
flee
from
the
sight
of
your
yes
it
was
she
gave
him
back
the
glasses
they
reveal
that
which
should
be
hidden
she
said
count
anteoni
took
the
glasses
slowly
from
her
hands
as
he
bent
to
do
it
he
looked
steadily
at
her
and
she
could
not
read
the
expression
in
his
eyes
the
desert
is
full
of
truth
is
that
what
you
mean
he
asked
she
made
no
reply
count
anteoni
stretched
out
his
hand
to
the
shining
expanse
before
them
the
man
who
is
afraid
of
prayer
is
unwise
to
set
foot
beyond
the
palm
trees
he
said
why
unwise
he
answered
her
very
gravely
the
arabs
have
a
saying
the
desert
is
the
garden
of
domini
did
not
ascend
the
tower
of
the
hotel
that
morning
she
had
seen
enough
for
the
moment
and
did
not
wish
to
disturb
her
impressions
by
adding
to
them
so
she
walked
back
to
the
hotel
du
desert
with
batouch
count
anteoni
had
said
to
her
at
the
door
of
the
garden
and
had
begged
her
to
come
again
whenever
she
liked
and
to
spend
as
many
hours
there
as
she
pleased
i
shall
take
you
at
your
word
she
said
frankly
i
feel
that
i
as
they
shook
hands
she
gave
him
her
card
he
took
out
his
by
the
way
he
said
the
big
hotel
you
passed
in
coming
here
is
mine
i
built
it
to
prevent
a
more
hideous
one
being
built
and
let
it
to
the
proprietor
you
might
like
to
ascend
the
tower
the
view
at
sundown
is
incomparable
at
present
the
hotel
is
shut
but
the
guardian
will
show
you
everything
if
you
give
him
my
he
pencilled
some
words
in
arabic
on
the
back
from
right
to
left
you
write
arabic
too
domini
said
watching
the
forming
of
the
pretty
curves
with
interest
oh
yes
i
am
more
than
half
african
though
my
father
was
a
sicilian
and
my
mother
a
he
gave
her
the
card
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
when
the
tall
white
door
was
softly
shut
by
smain
domini
felt
rather
like
a
new
eve
expelled
from
paradise
without
an
adam
as
a
companion
in
exile
well
madame
said
batouch
have
i
spoken
the
truth
yes
no
european
garden
can
be
so
beautiful
as
that
now
i
am
going
straight
she
smiled
to
herself
as
she
said
the
last
word
outside
the
hotel
they
found
hadj
looking
ferocious
he
exchanged
some
words
with
batouch
accompanying
them
with
violent
gestures
when
he
had
finished
speaking
he
spat
upon
the
ground
what
is
the
matter
with
him
domini
asked
the
monsieur
who
is
staying
here
would
not
take
him
but
went
into
the
desert
alone
hadj
wishes
that
the
nomads
may
cut
his
throat
and
that
his
flesh
may
be
eaten
by
jackals
hadj
is
sure
that
he
is
a
bad
man
and
will
come
to
a
bad
because
he
does
not
want
a
guide
every
day
but
neither
shall
madame
is
quite
different
i
would
give
my
life
for
don
t
do
that
but
go
this
afternoon
and
find
me
a
horse
i
don
t
want
a
quiet
one
but
something
with
devil
something
that
a
spahi
would
like
to
the
desert
spirits
were
speaking
to
her
body
as
well
as
to
her
mind
a
physical
audacity
was
stirring
in
her
and
she
longed
to
give
it
vent
madame
is
like
the
lion
she
is
afraid
of
you
speak
without
knowing
batouch
don
t
come
for
me
this
afternoon
but
bring
round
a
horse
if
you
can
find
one
this
very
evening
i
will
no
batouch
i
said
she
spoke
with
a
quiet
but
inflexible
decision
which
silenced
him
then
she
gave
him
ten
francs
and
went
into
the
dark
house
from
which
the
burning
noonday
sun
was
carefully
excluded
she
intended
to
rest
after
and
towards
sunset
to
go
to
the
big
hotel
and
mount
alone
to
the
summit
of
the
tower
it
was
twelve
and
a
faint
rattle
of
knives
and
forks
from
the
told
her
that
was
ready
she
went
upstairs
washed
her
face
and
hands
in
cold
water
stood
still
while
suzanne
shook
the
dust
from
her
gown
and
then
descended
to
the
public
room
the
keen
air
had
given
her
an
appetite
the
was
large
and
shady
and
was
filled
with
small
tables
at
only
three
of
which
were
people
sitting
four
french
officers
sat
together
at
one
a
small
fat
perspiring
man
of
middle
age
probably
a
commercial
traveller
who
had
eyes
like
a
melancholy
toad
was
at
another
eating
olives
with
anxious
rapidity
and
wiping
his
forehead
perpetually
with
a
dirty
white
handkerchief
at
the
third
was
the
priest
with
whom
domini
had
spoken
in
the
church
his
napkin
was
tucked
under
his
beard
and
he
was
drinking
soup
as
he
bent
well
over
his
plate
a
young
arab
waiter
with
a
thin
dissipated
face
stood
near
the
door
in
bright
yellow
slippers
when
domini
came
in
he
stole
forward
to
show
her
to
her
table
making
a
soft
shuffling
sound
on
the
polished
wooden
floor
the
priest
glanced
up
over
his
napkin
rose
and
bowed
the
french
officers
stared
with
an
interest
they
were
too
chivalrous
to
attempt
to
conceal
only
the
fat
little
man
was
entirely
unconcerned
he
wiped
his
forehead
stuck
his
fork
deftly
into
an
olive
and
continued
to
look
like
a
melancholy
toad
entangled
by
fate
in
commercial
pursuits
domini
s
table
was
by
a
window
across
which
green
venetian
shutters
were
drawn
it
was
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
other
guests
who
did
not
live
in
the
house
but
came
there
each
day
for
their
meals
near
it
she
noticed
a
table
laid
for
one
person
and
so
arranged
that
if
he
came
to
he
would
sit
exactly
opposite
to
her
she
wondered
if
it
was
for
the
man
at
whom
she
had
just
been
looking
through
count
anteoni
s
the
man
who
had
fled
from
prayer
in
the
garden
of
as
she
glanced
at
the
empty
chair
standing
before
the
knives
and
forks
and
the
white
cloth
she
was
uncertain
whether
she
wished
it
to
be
filled
by
the
traveller
or
not
she
felt
his
presence
in
as
a
warring
element
that
she
knew
she
knew
also
that
she
had
come
there
to
find
peace
a
great
calm
and
remoteness
in
which
she
could
at
last
grow
develop
loose
her
true
self
from
cramping
bondage
come
to
an
understanding
with
herself
face
her
heart
and
soul
and
as
it
were
look
them
in
the
eyes
and
know
them
for
what
they
were
good
or
evil
in
the
presence
of
this
total
stranger
there
was
something
unpleasantly
distracting
which
she
could
not
and
did
not
ignore
something
which
roused
her
antagonism
and
which
at
the
same
time
compelled
her
attention
she
had
been
conscious
of
it
in
the
train
conscious
of
it
in
the
tunnel
at
twilight
at
night
in
the
hotel
and
once
again
in
count
anteoni
s
garden
this
man
intruded
himself
no
doubt
unconsciously
or
even
against
his
will
into
her
sight
her
thoughts
each
time
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
giving
herself
to
what
count
anteoni
called
the
desert
so
it
had
been
when
the
train
ran
out
of
the
tunnel
into
the
blue
country
so
it
had
been
again
when
she
leaned
on
the
white
wall
and
gazed
out
over
the
shining
fastnesses
of
the
sun
he
was
there
like
an
enemy
like
something
determined
egoistical
that
said
to
her
you
would
look
at
the
greatness
of
the
desert
at
immensity
infinity
god
look
at
and
she
could
not
turn
her
eyes
away
each
time
the
man
had
as
if
without
effort
conquered
the
great
competing
power
fastened
her
thoughts
upon
himself
set
her
imagination
working
about
his
life
even
made
her
heart
beat
faster
with
some
thrill
of
what
was
it
pity
was
it
a
faint
horror
she
knew
that
to
call
the
feeling
merely
repugnance
would
not
be
sincere
the
intensity
the
vitality
of
the
force
shut
up
in
a
human
being
almost
angered
her
at
this
moment
as
she
looked
at
the
empty
chair
and
realised
all
that
it
had
suddenly
set
at
work
there
was
something
insolent
in
humanity
as
well
as
something
divine
and
just
then
she
felt
the
insolence
more
than
the
divinity
terrifically
greater
more
overpowering
than
man
the
desert
was
yet
also
somehow
less
than
man
feebler
vaguer
or
else
how
could
she
have
been
grasped
moved
turned
to
curiosity
surmise
almost
to
a
sort
of
dread
all
at
the
desert
s
expense
by
the
distant
moving
figure
seen
through
the
glasses
yes
as
she
looked
at
the
little
white
table
and
thought
of
all
this
domini
began
to
feel
angry
but
she
was
capable
of
effort
whether
mental
or
physical
and
now
she
resolutely
switched
her
mind
off
from
the
antagonistic
stranger
and
devoted
her
thoughts
to
the
priest
whose
narrow
back
she
saw
down
the
room
in
the
distance
as
she
ate
her
fish
a
mystery
of
the
seas
of
robertville
she
imagined
his
quiet
existence
in
this
remote
place
sunny
day
succeeding
sunny
day
each
one
surely
so
like
its
brother
that
life
must
become
a
sort
of
dream
through
which
the
voice
of
the
church
bell
called
melodiously
and
the
incense
rising
before
the
altar
shed
a
drowsy
perfume
how
strange
it
must
be
really
to
live
in
to
have
your
house
your
work
here
your
friendships
here
your
duties
here
perhaps
here
too
the
tiny
section
of
earth
which
would
hold
at
the
last
your
body
it
must
be
strange
and
monotonous
and
yet
surely
rather
sweet
rather
safe
the
officers
lifted
their
heads
from
their
plates
the
fat
man
stared
the
priest
looked
quietly
up
over
his
napkin
and
the
arab
waiter
slipped
forward
with
attentive
haste
for
the
swing
door
of
the
at
this
moment
was
pushed
open
and
the
traveller
so
domini
called
him
in
her
thoughts
entered
and
stood
looking
with
hesitation
from
one
table
to
another
domini
did
not
glance
up
she
knew
who
it
was
and
kept
her
eyes
resolutely
on
her
plate
she
heard
the
arab
speak
a
loud
noise
of
stout
boots
tramping
over
the
wooden
floor
and
the
creak
of
a
chair
receiving
a
surely
tired
body
the
traveller
sat
down
heavily
she
went
on
slowly
eating
the
large
robertville
fish
which
was
like
something
between
a
trout
and
a
herring
when
she
had
finished
it
she
gazed
straight
before
her
at
the
cloth
and
strove
to
resume
her
thoughts
of
the
priest
s
life
in
but
she
could
not
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
were
back
again
in
count
anteoni
s
garden
she
looked
once
more
through
the
glasses
and
heard
the
four
cries
of
the
mueddin
and
saw
the
pacing
figure
in
the
burning
heat
the
arab
bent
in
prayer
the
one
who
watched
him
the
flight
and
she
was
indignant
with
herself
for
her
strange
inability
to
govern
her
mind
it
seemed
to
her
a
pitiful
thing
of
which
she
should
be
ashamed
she
heard
the
waiter
set
down
a
plate
upon
the
traveller
s
table
and
then
the
noise
of
a
liquid
being
poured
into
a
glass
she
could
not
keep
her
eyes
down
any
more
besides
why
should
she
was
breeding
in
her
a
or
a
too
acute
consciousness
of
others
that
was
unnatural
in
her
she
had
never
been
sensitive
like
this
in
her
former
life
but
the
fierce
african
sun
seemed
now
to
have
thawed
the
ice
of
her
indifference
she
felt
everything
with
almost
unpleasant
acuteness
all
her
senses
seemed
to
her
sharpened
she
saw
she
heard
as
she
had
never
seen
and
heard
till
now
suddenly
she
remembered
her
almost
violent
prayer
let
me
be
alive
let
me
feel
and
she
was
aware
that
such
a
prayer
might
have
an
answer
that
would
be
terrible
looking
up
thus
with
a
kind
of
severe
determination
she
saw
the
man
again
he
was
eating
and
was
not
looking
towards
her
and
she
fancied
that
his
eyes
were
downcast
with
as
much
conscious
resolution
as
hers
had
been
a
moment
before
he
wore
the
same
suit
as
he
had
worn
in
the
train
but
now
it
was
flecked
with
desert
dust
she
could
not
place
him
at
all
he
was
not
of
the
small
fat
man
s
order
they
would
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
french
officers
she
could
not
imagine
how
he
would
be
with
them
the
only
other
man
in
the
room
the
servant
had
gone
out
for
the
moment
was
the
priest
he
and
the
priest
they
would
surely
be
antagonists
had
he
not
turned
aside
to
avoid
the
priest
in
the
tunnel
probably
he
was
one
of
those
many
men
who
actively
hate
the
priesthood
to
whom
the
soutane
is
anathema
could
he
find
pleasant
companionship
with
such
a
man
as
count
anteoni
an
original
man
no
doubt
but
also
a
cultivated
and
easy
man
of
the
world
she
smiled
internally
at
the
mere
thought
whatever
this
stranger
might
be
she
felt
that
he
was
as
far
from
being
a
man
of
the
world
as
she
was
from
being
a
cockney
sempstress
or
a
veiled
favourite
in
a
harem
she
could
not
she
found
imagine
him
easily
at
home
with
any
type
of
human
being
with
which
she
was
acquainted
yet
no
doubt
like
all
men
he
had
somewhere
friends
relations
possibly
even
a
wife
children
no
doubt
then
why
could
she
not
believe
it
the
man
had
finished
his
fish
he
rested
his
broad
burnt
hands
on
the
table
on
each
side
of
his
plate
and
looked
at
them
steadily
then
he
turned
his
head
and
glanced
sideways
at
the
priest
who
was
behind
him
to
the
right
then
he
looked
again
at
his
hands
and
domini
knew
that
all
the
time
he
was
thinking
about
her
as
she
was
thinking
about
him
she
felt
the
violence
of
his
thought
like
the
violence
of
a
hand
striking
her
the
arab
waiter
brought
her
some
ragout
of
mutton
and
peas
and
she
looked
down
again
at
her
plate
as
she
left
the
room
after
the
priest
again
got
up
and
bowed
she
stopped
for
a
moment
to
speak
to
him
all
the
french
officers
surveyed
her
tall
upright
figure
and
broad
athletic
shoulders
with
intent
admiration
domini
knew
it
and
was
indifferent
if
a
hundred
french
soldiers
had
been
staring
at
her
critically
she
would
not
have
cared
at
all
she
was
not
a
shy
woman
and
was
in
nowise
uncomfortable
when
many
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
so
she
stood
and
talked
a
little
to
the
priest
about
count
anteoni
and
her
pleasure
in
his
garden
and
as
she
did
so
feeling
her
present
calm
she
wondered
secretly
at
the
wholly
unnatural
turmoil
she
called
it
that
exaggerating
her
feeling
because
it
was
unusual
in
which
she
had
been
a
few
minutes
before
as
she
sat
at
her
table
the
priest
spoke
well
of
count
anteoni
he
is
very
generous
he
said
then
he
paused
twisting
his
napkin
and
added
but
i
never
have
any
real
intercourse
with
him
madame
i
believe
he
comes
here
in
search
of
solitude
he
spends
days
and
even
weeks
alone
shut
up
in
his
thinking
she
said
the
priest
looked
slightly
surprised
it
would
be
difficult
not
to
think
madame
would
it
not
oh
yes
but
count
anteoni
thinks
rather
as
a
fights
i
she
heard
a
chair
creak
in
the
distance
and
glanced
over
her
shoulder
the
traveller
had
turned
sideways
at
once
she
bade
the
priest
and
walked
away
and
out
through
the
swing
door
all
the
afternoon
she
rested
the
silence
was
profound
was
enjoying
a
siesta
in
the
heat
domini
revelled
in
the
stillness
the
fatigue
of
travel
had
quite
gone
from
her
now
and
she
began
to
feel
strangely
at
home
suzanne
had
arranged
photographs
books
flowers
in
the
little
salon
had
put
cushions
here
and
there
and
thrown
pretty
coverings
over
the
sofa
and
the
two
low
chairs
the
room
had
an
air
of
cosiness
of
occupation
it
was
a
room
one
could
sit
in
without
restlessness
and
domini
liked
its
simplicity
its
bare
wooden
floor
and
white
walls
the
sun
made
everything
right
here
without
the
sun
but
she
could
not
think
of
without
the
sun
she
read
on
the
verandah
and
dreamed
and
the
hours
slipped
quickly
away
no
one
came
to
disturb
her
she
heard
no
footsteps
no
movements
of
humanity
in
the
house
now
and
then
the
sound
of
voices
floated
up
to
her
from
the
gardens
mingling
with
the
peculiar
dry
noise
of
palm
leaves
stirring
in
a
breeze
or
she
heard
the
distant
gallop
of
horses
feet
the
church
bell
chimed
the
hours
and
made
her
recall
the
previous
evening
already
it
seemed
far
off
in
the
past
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
she
had
not
yet
spent
hours
in
a
conviction
came
to
her
that
she
would
be
there
for
a
long
while
that
she
would
strike
roots
into
this
sunny
place
of
peace
when
she
heard
the
church
bell
now
she
thought
of
the
interior
of
the
church
and
of
the
priest
with
an
odd
sort
of
familiar
pleasure
as
people
in
england
often
think
of
the
village
church
in
which
they
have
always
been
accustomed
to
worship
and
of
the
clergyman
who
ministers
in
it
sunday
after
sunday
yet
at
moments
she
remembered
her
inward
cry
in
count
anteoni
s
garden
oh
what
is
going
to
happen
to
me
here
and
then
she
was
dimly
conscious
that
was
the
home
of
many
things
besides
peace
it
held
warring
influences
at
one
moment
it
lulled
her
and
she
was
like
an
infant
rocked
in
a
cradle
at
another
moment
it
stirred
her
and
she
was
a
woman
on
the
edge
of
mysterious
possibilities
there
must
be
many
individualities
among
the
desert
spirits
of
whom
count
anteoni
had
spoken
now
one
was
with
her
and
whispered
to
her
now
another
she
fancied
the
light
touch
of
their
hands
on
hers
pulling
gently
at
her
as
a
child
pulls
you
to
take
you
to
see
a
treasure
and
their
treasure
was
surely
far
away
hidden
in
the
distance
of
the
desert
sands
as
soon
as
the
sun
began
to
decline
towards
the
west
she
put
on
her
hat
thrust
the
card
count
anteoni
had
given
her
into
her
glove
and
set
out
towards
the
big
hotel
alone
she
met
hadj
as
she
walked
down
the
arcade
he
wished
to
accompany
her
and
was
evidently
filled
with
treacherous
ideas
of
supplanting
his
friend
batouch
but
she
gave
him
a
franc
and
sent
him
away
the
franc
soothed
him
slightly
yet
she
could
see
that
his
childish
vanity
was
injured
there
was
a
malicious
gleam
in
his
long
narrow
eyes
as
he
looked
after
her
yet
there
was
genuine
admiration
too
the
arab
bows
down
instinctively
before
any
dominating
spirit
and
such
a
spirit
in
a
foreign
woman
flashes
in
his
eyes
like
a
bright
flame
physical
strength
too
appeals
to
him
with
peculiar
force
hadj
tossed
his
head
upwards
tucked
in
his
chin
and
muttered
some
words
in
his
brown
throat
as
he
noted
the
elastic
grace
with
which
the
rejecting
foreign
woman
moved
till
she
was
out
of
his
sight
and
she
never
looked
back
at
him
that
was
a
keen
arrow
in
her
quiver
he
fell
into
a
deep
reverie
under
the
arcade
and
his
face
became
suddenly
like
the
face
of
a
sphinx
meanwhile
domini
had
forgotten
him
she
had
turned
to
the
left
down
a
small
street
in
which
some
indians
and
superior
arabs
had
bazaars
one
of
the
latter
came
out
from
the
shadow
of
his
hanging
rugs
and
embroideries
as
she
passed
and
addressing
her
in
a
strange
mixture
of
incorrect
french
and
english
begged
her
to
come
in
and
examine
his
wares
she
shook
her
head
but
could
not
help
looking
at
him
with
interest
he
was
the
thinnest
man
she
had
ever
seen
and
moved
and
stood
almost
as
if
he
were
boneless
the
line
of
his
delicate
and
yet
arbitrary
features
was
fierce
his
face
was
pitted
with
and
marked
by
an
old
wound
evidently
made
by
a
knife
which
stretched
from
his
left
cheek
to
his
forehead
ending
just
over
the
left
eyebrow
the
expression
of
his
eyes
was
almost
disgustingly
intelligent
while
they
were
fixed
upon
her
domini
felt
as
if
her
body
were
a
glass
box
in
which
all
her
thoughts
feelings
and
desires
were
ranged
for
his
inspection
in
his
demeanour
there
was
much
that
pleaded
but
also
something
that
commanded
his
fingers
were
unnaturally
long
and
held
a
small
bag
and
he
planted
himself
right
before
her
in
the
road
madame
come
in
venez
avec
moi
venez
venez
i
have
much
i
will
show
j
ai
des
choses
extraordinaires
tenez
look
he
untied
the
mouth
of
the
bag
domini
looked
into
it
expecting
to
see
something
precious
jewels
perhaps
she
saw
only
a
quantity
of
sand
laughed
and
moved
to
go
on
she
thought
the
arab
was
an
impudent
fellow
trying
to
make
fun
of
her
no
no
madame
do
not
laugh
ce
sable
est
du
desert
il

a
des
histoires
il

histoire

come
bazaar
i
will
read
for
madame
what
will
be
what
will
become
i
will
read
i
will
tell
tenez
he
stared
down
into
the
bag
and
his
face
became
suddenly
stern
and
fixed
deja
je
vois
des
choses
dans
la
vie
de
madame
ah
mon
dieu
ah
mon
dieu
no
no
domini
said
she
had
hesitated
but
was
now
determined
i
have
no
time
the
man
cast
a
quick
and
sly
glance
at
her
then
stared
once
more
into
the
bag
ah
mon
dieu
ah
mon
dieu
he
repeated
the
life
to
come
the
life
of
madame
i
see
it
in
the
bag
his
face
looked
tortured
domini
walked
on
hurriedly
when
she
had
got
to
a
little
distance
she
glanced
back
the
man
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
glaring
into
the
bag
his
voice
came
down
the
street
to
her
ah
mon
dieu
ah
mon
dieu
i
see
it
i
see
je
vois
la
vie
de
madame
ah
mon
dieu
there
was
an
accent
of
dreadful
suffering
in
his
voice
it
made
domini
shudder
she
passed
the
mouth
of
the
dancers
street
at
the
corner
there
was
a
large
cafe
maure
and
here
on
rugs
laid
by
the
side
of
the
road
numbers
of
arabs
were
stretched
some
sipping
tea
from
glasses
some
playing
dominoes
some
conversing
some
staring
calmly
into
vacancy
like
animals
drowned
in
a
lethargic
dream
a
black
boy
ran
by
holding
a
hammered
brass
tray
on
which
were
some
small
china
cups
filled
with
thick
coffee
halfway
up
the
street
he
met
three
unveiled
women
clad
in
voluminous
white
dresses
with
scarlet
yellow
and
purple
handkerchiefs
bound
over
their
black
hair
he
stopped
and
the
women
took
the
cups
with
their
fingers
two
young
arabs
joined
them
there
was
a
scuffle
white
lumps
of
sugar
flew
up
into
the
air
then
there
was
a
babel
of
voices
a
torrent
of
cries
full
of
barbaric
gaiety
before
it
had
died
out
of
domini
s
ears
she
stood
by
the
statue
of
cardinal
lavigerie
rather
militant
than
priestly
raised
high
on
a
marble
pedestal
it
faced
the
long
road
which
melting
at
last
into
a
faint
desert
track
stretched
away
to
tombouctou
the
mitre
upon
the
head
was
worn
surely
as
if
it
were
a
helmet
the
pastoral
staff
with
its
double
cross
was
grasped
as
if
it
were
a
sword
upon
the
lower
cross
was
stretched
a
figure
of
the
christ
in
agony
and
the
cardinal
gazing
with
the
eyes
of
an
eagle
out
into
the
pathless
wastes
of
sand
that
lay
beyond
the
palm
trees
seemed
by
his
mere
attitude
to
cry
to
all
the
myriad
hordes
of
men
the
sahara
mothered
in
her
mystery
and
silence
come
unto
the
church
come
unto
me
he
called
men
in
from
the
desert
domini
fancied
his
voice
echoing
along
the
sands
till
the
worshippers
of
allah
and
of
his
prophet
heard
it
like
a
clarion
in
tombouctou
when
she
reached
the
great
hotel
the
sun
was
just
beginning
to
set
she
drew
count
anteoni
s
card
from
her
glove
and
rang
the
bell
after
a
long
interval
a
magnificent
man
with
the
features
of
an
arab
but
a
skin
almost
as
black
as
a
negro
opened
the
door
can
i
go
up
the
tower
to
see
the
sunset
she
asked
giving
him
the

the
man
bowed
low
escorted
her
through
a
long
hall
full
of
furniture
shrouded
in
coverings
up
a
staircase
along
a
corridor
with
numbered
rooms
up
a
second
staircase
and
out
upon
a
roof
from
which
the
tower
soared
high
above
the
houses
and
palms
of
a
landmark
visible

journey
out
in

a
narrow
spiral
stair

up

domini
said
i
shall
stay
some
time
and
i
would
rather
not
keep
she
put
some
money
into
the
arab
s
hand
he
looked
pleased
yet
doubtful
too
for
a
moment
then
he
seemed
to
banish
his
hesitation
and
with
a
deprecating
smile
said
something
which
she
could
not
understand
she
nodded
intelligently
to
get
rid
of
him
already
from
the
roof
she
caught
sight
of
a
great
visionary
panorama
glowing
with
colour
and
magic
she
was
impatient
to
climb
still
higher
into
the
sky
to
look
down
on
the
world
as
an
eagle
does
so
she
turned
away
decisively
and
mounted
the
dark
winding
stair
till
she
reached
a
door
she
pushed
it
open
with
some
difficulty
and
came
out
into
the
air
at
a
dizzy
height
shutting
the
door
forcibly
behind
her
with
an
energetic
movement
of
her
strong
arms
the
top
of
the
tower
was
small
and
square
and
guarded
by
a
white
parapet
breast
high
in
the
centre
of
it
rose
the
outer
walls
and
the
ceiling
of
the
top
of
the
staircase
which
prevented
a
person
standing
on
one
side
of
the
tower
from
seeing
anybody
who
was
standing
at
the
opposite
side
there
was
just
sufficient
space
between
parapet
and
staircase
wall
for
two
people
to
pass
with
difficulty
and
manoeuvring
but
domini
was
not
concerned
with
such
trivial
details
as
she
would
have
thought
them
had
she
thought
of
them
directly
she
had
shut
the
little
door
and
felt
herself
alone
alone
as
an
eagle
in
the
sky
she
took
the
step
forward
that
brought
her
to
the
parapet
leaned
her
arms
on
it
looked
out
and
was
lost
in
a
passion
of
contemplation
at
first
she
did
not
discern
any
of
the
multitudinous
minutiae
in
the
great
evening
vision
beneath
and
around
her
she
only
felt
conscious
of
depth
height
space
colour
mystery
calm
she
did
not
measure
she
did
not
differentiate
she
simply
stood
there
leaning
lightly
on
the
snowy
plaster
work
and
experienced
something
that
she
had
never
experienced
before
that
she
had
never
imagined
it
was
scarcely
vivid
for
in
everything
that
is
vivid
there
seems
to
be
something
small
the
point
to
which
wonders
converge
the
intense
spark
to
which
many
fires
have
given
themselves
as
food
the
drop
which
contains
the
murmuring
force
of
innumerable
rivers
it
was
more
than
vivid
it
was
reliantly
dim
as
is
that
pulse
of
life
which
is
heard
through
and
above
the
crash
of
generations
and
centuries
falling
downwards
into
the
abyss
that
persistent
enduring
indifferent
in
its
mystical
regularity
that
ignores
and
triumphs
and
never
grows
louder
nor
diminishes
inexorably
calm
inexorably
steady
undefeated
more
utterly
unaffected
by
unnumbered
millions
of
tragedies
and
deaths
many
sounds
rose
from
far
down
beneath
the
tower
but
at
first
domini
did
not
hear
them
she
was
only
aware
of
an
immense
living
silence
a
silence
flowing
beneath
around
and
above
her
in
dumb
invisible
waves
circles
of
rest
and
peace
cool
and
serene
widened
as
circles
in
a
pool
towards
the
unseen
limits
of
the
satisfied
world
limits
lost
in
the
hidden
regions
beyond
the
misty
purple
magic
where
sky
and
desert
met
and
she
felt
as
if
her
brain
ceaselessly
at
work
from
its
birth
her
heart
unresting
hitherto
in
a
commotion
of
desires
her
soul
an
eternal
flutter
of
anxious
passionate
wings
folded
themselves
together
gently
like
the
petals
of
roses
when
a
summer
night
comes
into
a
garden
she
was
not
conscious
that
she
breathed
while
she
stood
there
she
thought
her
bosom
ceased
to
rise
and
fall
the
very
blood
dreamed
in
her
veins
as
the
light
of
evening
dreamed
in
the
blue
she
knew
the
great
pause
that
seems
to
divide
some
human
lives
in
two
as
the
great
gulf
divided
him
who
lay
in
abraham
s
bosom
from
him
who
was
shrouded
in
the
veil
of
fire
book
ii
the
voice
of

chapter
vii
the
music
of
things
from
below
stole
up
through
the
ethereal
spaces
to
domini
without
piercing
her
dream
but
suddenly
she
started
with
a
sense
of
pain
so
acute
that
it
shook
her
body
and
set
the
pulses
in
her
temples
beating
she
lifted
her
arms
swiftly
from
the
parapet
and
turned
her
head
she
had
heard
a
little
grating
noise
which
seemed
to
be
near
to
her
enclosed
with
her
on
this
height
in
the
narrow
space
of
the
tower
slight
as
it
was
and
short
already
she
no
longer
heard
it
it
had
in
an
instant
driven
her
out
of
heaven
as
if
it
had
been
an
angel
with
a
flaming
sword
she
felt
sure
that
there
must
be
something
alive
with
her
at
the
tower
summit
something
which
by
a
sudden
movement
had
caused
the
little
noise
she
had
heard
what
was
it
when
she
turned
her
head
she
could
only
see
the
outer
wall
of
the
staircase
a
section
of
the
narrow
white
space
which
surrounded
it
an
angle
of
the
parapet
and
blue
air
she
listened
holding
her
breath
and
closing
her
two
hands
on
the
parapet
which
was
warm
from
the
sun
now
caught
back
to
reality
she
could
hear
faintly
the
sounds
from
below
in
but
they
did
not
concern
her
and
she
wished
to
shut
them
out
from
her
ears
what
did
concern
her
was
to
know
what
was
with
her
up
in
the
sky
had
a
bird
alighted
on
the
parapet
and
startled
her
by
scratching
at
the
plaster
with
its
beak
could
a
mouse
have
shuffled
in
the
wall
or
was
there
a
human
being
up
there
hidden
from
her
by
the
masonry
this
last
supposition
disturbed
her
almost
absurdly
for
a
moment
she
was
inclined
to
walk
quickly
round
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
tower
but
something
stronger
than
her
inclination
an
imperious
shyness
held
her
motionless
she
had
been
carried
so
far
away
from
the
world
that
she
felt
unable
to
face
the
scrutiny
of
any
creature
having
been
in
the
transparent
region
of
magic
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
her
secret
the
great
secret
of
the
absolutely
true
the
naked
personality
hidden
in
every
human
being
were
set
blazing
in
her
eyes
like
some
torch
borne
in
a
procession
just
for
that
moment
the
moment
past
she
could
look
anyone
fearlessly
in
the
face
but
not
now
not
yet
while
she
stood
there
half
turning
round
she
heard
the
sound
again
and
knew
what
caused
it
a
foot
had
shifted
on
the
plaster
floor
there
was
someone
else
then
looking
out
over
the
desert
a
sudden
idea
struck
her
probably
it
was
count
anteoni
he
knew
she
was
coming
and
might
have
decided
to
act
once
more
as
her
cicerone
he
had
not
heard
her
climbing
the
stairs
and
having
gone
to
the
far
side
of
the
tower
was
no
doubt
watching
the
sunset
lost
in
a
dream
as
she
had
been
she
resolved
not
to
disturb
him
if
it
was
he
when
he
had
dreamed
enough
he
must
inevitably
come
round
to
where
she
was
standing
in
order
to
gain
the
staircase
she
would
let
him
find
her
there
less
troubled
now
but
in
an
utterly
changed
mood
she
turned
leaned
once
more
on
the
parapet
and
looked
over
this
time
observantly
prepared
to
note
the
details
that
combined
and
veiled
in
the
evening
light
of
africa
made
the
magic
which
had
so
instantly
entranced
her
she
looked
down
into
the
village
and
could
see
its
extent
precisely
how
it
was
placed
in
the
sahara
in
what
relation
exactly
it
stood
to
the
mountain
ranges
to
the
palm
groves
and
the
arid
sunburnt
tracts
where
its
life
centred
and
where
it
tailed
away
into
suburban
edges
not
unlike
the
ragged
edges
of
worn
garments
where
it
was
idle
and
frivolous
where
busy
and
sedulous
she
realised
for
the
first
time
that
there
were
two
distinct
layers
of
life
in
the
life
of
the
streets
courts
gardens
and
and
above
it
the
life
of
the
roofs
both
were
now
spread
out
before
her
and
the
latter
in
its
domestic
intimacy
interested
and
charmed
her
she
saw
upon
the
roofs
the
children
playing
with
little
dogs
goats
fowls
mothers
in
rags
of
gaudy
colours
stirring
the
barley
for
shredding
vegetables
pounding
coffee
stewing
meat
plucking
chickens
bending
over
bowls
from
which
rose
the
steam
of
soup
small
girls
seated
in
dusty
corners
solemnly
winding
wool
on
sticks
and
pausing
now
and
then
to
squeak
to
distant
members
of
the
home
circle
or
to
smell
at
flowers
laid
beside
them
as
solace
to
their
industry
an
old
grandmother
rocked
and
kissed
a
naked
baby
with
a
pot
belly
a
big
grey
rat
stole
from
a
rubbish
heap
close
by
her
flitted
across
the
sunlit
space
and
disappeared
into
a
cranny
pigeons
circled
above
the
home
activities
delicate
lovers
of
the
air
wandered
among
the
palm
tops
returned
and
fearlessly
alighted
on
the
brown
earth
parapets
strutting
hither
and
thither
and
making
their
perpetual
characteristic
motion
of
the
head
half
nod
half
genuflection
veiled
girls
promenaded
to
take
the
evening
cool
folding
their
arms
beneath
their
flowing
draperies
and
chattering
to
one
another
in
voices
that
domini
could
not
hear
more
close
at
hand
certain
roofs
in
the
dancers
street
revealed
luxurious
sofas
on
which
painted
houris
were
lolling
in
sinuous
attitudes
or
were
posed
with
a
stiffness
of
idols
little
tables
set
with
coffee
cups
others
round
which
were
gathered
zouaves
intent
on
card
games
but
ever
ready
to
pause
for
a
caress
or
for
some
jesting
absurdity
with
the
women
who
squatted
beside
them
some
men
dressed
like
girls
went
to
and
fro
serving
the
dancers
with
sweetmeats
and
with
cigarettes
their
beards
flowing
down
with
a
grotesque
effect
over
their
dresses
of
embroidered
muslin
their
hairy
arms
emerging
from
hanging
sleeves
of
silk
a
negro
boy
sat
holding
a
tomtom
between
his
bare
knees
and
beating
it
with
supple
hands
and
a
jewess
performed
the
stomach
dance
waving
two
handkerchiefs
stained
red
and
purple
and
singing
in
a
loud
and
barbarous
contralto
voice
which
domini
could
hear
but
very
faintly
the
stopped
their
game
and
watched
her
and
domini
watched
too
for
the
first
time
and
from
this
immense
height
she
saw
this
universal
dance
of
the
east
the
figure
fantastically
dwarfed
waving
its
tiny
hands
wriggling
its
minute
body
turning
about
like
a
little
top
strutting
and
bending
while
the
soldiers
small
almost
from
here
as
toys
taken
out
of
a
box
assumed
attitudes
of
deep
attention
as
they
leaned
upon
the
stretching
out
their
legs
enveloped
in
trousers
domini
thought
of
the
recruits
now
no
doubt
undergoing
elsewhere
their
initiation
for
a
moment
she
seemed
to
see
their
coarse
peasant
faces
rigid
with
surprise
their
hanging
jaws
their
childish
and
yet
sensual
round
eyes
notre
dame
de
la
garde
must
seem
very
far
away
from
them
now
with
that
thought
she
looked
quickly
away
from
the
jewess
and
the
soldiers
she
felt
a
sudden
need
of
something
more
nearly
in
relation
with
her
inner
self
she
was
almost
angry
as
she
realised
how
deep
had
been
her
momentary
interest
in
a
scene
suggestive
of
a
license
which
was
surely
unattractive
to
her
yet
was
it
unattractive
she
scarcely
knew
but
she
knew
that
it
had
kindled
in
her
a
sudden
and
very
strong
curiosity
even
a
vague
momentary
desire
that
she
had
been
born
in
some
tent
of
the
ouled
nails
no
that
was
impossible
she
had
not
felt
such
a
desire
even
for
an
instant
she
looked
towards
the
thickets
of
the
palms
towards
the
mountains
full
of
changing
exquisite
colours
towards
the
desert
and
at
once
the
dream
began
to
return
and
she
felt
as
if
hands
slipped
under
her
heart
and
uplifted
it
what
depths
and
heights
were
within
her
what
deep
dark
valleys
and
what
mountain
peaks
and
how
she
travelled
within
herself
with
swiftness
of
light
with
speed
of
the
wind
what
terrors
of
activity
she
knew
did
every
human
being
know
similar
terrors
the
colours
everywhere
deepened
as
day
failed
the
desert
spirits
were
at
work
she
thought
of
count
anteoni
again
and
resolved
to
go
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
tower
as
she
moved
to
do
this
she
heard
once
more
the
shifting
of
a
foot
on
the
plaster
floor
then
a
step
evidently
she
had
infected
him
with
an
intention
similar
to
her
own
she
went
on
still
hearing
the
step
turned
the
corner
and
stood
face
to
face
in
the
strong
evening
light
with
the
traveller
their
bodies
almost
touched
in
the
narrow
space
before
they
both
stopped
startled
for
a
moment
they
stood
still
looking
at
each
other
as
people
might
look
who
have
spoken
together
who
know
something
of
each
other
s
lives
who
may
like
or
dislike
wish
to
avoid
or
to
draw
near
to
each
other
but
who
can
not
pretend
that
they
are
complete
strangers
wholly
indifferent
to
each
other
they
met
in
the
sky
almost
as
one
bird
may
meet
another
on
the
wing
and
to
domini
at
any
rate
it
seemed
as
if
the
depth
height
space
colour
mystery
and
calm
yes
even
the
calm
which
were
above
around
and
beneath
them
had
been
placed
there
by
hidden
hands
as
a
setting
for
their
encounter
even
as
the
abrupt
pageant
of
the
previous
day
into
which
the
train
had
emerged
from
the
blackness
of
the
tunnel
had
surely
been
created
as
a
frame
for
the
face
which
had
looked
upon
her
as
if
out
of
the
heart
of
the
sun
the
assumption
was
absurd
unreasonable
yet
vital
she
did
not
combat
it
because
she
felt
it
too
powerful
for
common
sense
to
strive
against
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
stranger
felt
it
too
that
she
saw
her
sensation
reflected
in
his
eyes
as
he
stood
between
the
parapet
and
the
staircase
wall
barring
in
despite
of
himself
her
path
the
moment
seemed
long
while
they
stood
motionless
then
the
man
took
off
his
soft
hat
awkwardly
yet
with
real
politeness
and
stood
quickly
sideways
against
the
parapet
to
let
her
pass
she
could
have
passed
if
she
had
brushed
against
him
and
made
a
movement
to
do
so
then
she
checked
herself
and
looked
at
him
again
as
if
she
expected
him
to
speak
to
her
his
hat
was
still
in
his
hand
and
the
light
desert
wind
faintly
stirred
his
short
brown
hair
he
did
not
speak
but
stood
there
crushing
himself
against
the
plaster
work
with
a
sort
of
fierce
timidity
as
if
he
dreaded
the
touch
of
her
skirt
against
him
and
longed
to
make
himself
small
to
shrivel
up
and
let
her
go
by
in
freedom
thank
you
she
said
in
french
she
passed
him
but
was
unable
to
do
so
without
touching
him
her
left
arm
was
hanging
down
and
her
bare
hand
knocked
against
the
back
of
the
hand
in
which
he
held
his
hat
she
felt
as
if
at
that
moment
she
touched
a
furnace
and
she
saw
him
shiver
slightly
as
men
sometimes
shiver
in
daylight
an
extraordinary
almost
motherly
sensation
of
pity
for
him
came
over
her
she
did
not
know
why
the
intense
heat
of
his
hand
the
shiver
that
ran
over
his
body
his
attitude
as
he
shrank
with
a
kind
of
timid
yet
ferocious
politeness
against
the
white
wall
the
expression
in
his
eyes
when
their
hands
touched
a
look
she
could
not
analyse
but
which
seemed
to
hold
a
mingling
of
wistfulness
and
repellance
as
of
a
being
stretching
out
arms
for
succour
and
crying
at
the
same
time
don
t
draw
near
to
me
leave
me
to
myself
everything
about
him
moved
her
she
felt
that
she
was
face
to
face
with
a
solitariness
of
soul
such
as
she
had
never
encountered
before
a
solitariness
that
was
cruel
that
was
weighed
down
with
agony
and
directly
she
had
passed
the
man
and
thanked
him
formally
she
stopped
with
her
usual
decision
of
manner
she
had
abruptly
made
up
her
mind
to
talk
to
him
he
was
already
moving
to
turn
away
she
spoke
quickly
and
in
french
isn
t
it
wonderful
here
she
said
and
she
made
her
voice
rather
loud
and
almost
sharp
to
arrest
his
attention
he
turned
round
swiftly
yet
somehow
reluctantly
looked
at
her
anxiously
and
seemed
doubtful
whether
he
would
reply
after
a
silence
that
was
short
but
that
seemed
and
in
such
circumstances
was
long
he
answered
in
french
very
wonderful
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
seemed
to
startle
him
he
stood
as
if
he
had
heard
an
unusual
noise
which
had
alarmed
him
and
looked
at
domini
as
if
he
expected
that
she
would
share
in
his
sensation
very
quietly
and
deliberately
she
leaned
her
arms
again
on
the
parapet
and
spoke
to
him
once
more
we
seem
to
be
the
only
travellers
the
man
s
attitude
became
slightly
calmer
he
looked
less
momentary
less
as
if
he
were
in
haste
to
go
but
still
shy
fierce
and
extraordinarily
unconventional
yes
madame
there
are
not
many
after
a
pause
and
with
an
uncertain
accent
he
added
pardon
madame
for
there
was
a
sudden
simplicity
almost
like
that
of
a
child
in
the
sound
of
his
voice
as
he
said
that
domini
knew
at
once
that
he
alluded
to
the
incident
at
the
station
of
that
he
was
trying
to
make
amends
the
way
he
did
it
touched
her
curiously
she
felt
inclined
to
stretch
out
her
hand
to
him
and
say
of
course
shake
hands
on
it
almost
as
an
honest
schoolboy
might
but
she
only
answered
i
know
it
was
only
an
accident
don
t
think
of
it
any
she
did
not
look
at
him
where
money
is
concerned
the
arabs
are
very
persistent
she
continued
the
man
laid
one
of
his
brown
hands
on
the
top
of
the
parapet
she
looked
at
it
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
never
before
seen
the
back
of
a
hand
express
so
much
of
character
look
so
intense
so
ardent
and
so
melancholy
as
his
yes
he
still
spoke
with
an
odd
timidity
with
an
air
of
listening
to
his
own
speech
as
if
in
some
strange
way
it
were
phenomenal
to
him
it
occurred
to
her
that
possibly
he
had
lived
much
in
lonely
places
in
which
his
solitude
had
rarely
been
broken
and
he
had
been
forced
to
acquire
the
habit
of
silence
but
they
are
very
picturesque
they
look
almost
like
some
religious
order
when
they
wear
their
hoods
don
t
you
think
so
she
saw
the
brown
hand
lifted
from
the
parapet
and
heard
her
companion
s
feet
shift
on
the
floor
of
the
tower
but
this
time
he
said
nothing
as
she
could
not
see
his
hand
now
she
looked
out
again
over
the
panorama
of
the
evening
which
was
deepening
in
intensity
with
every
passing
moment
and
immediately
she
was
conscious
of
two
feelings
that
filled
her
with
wonder
a
much
stronger
and
sweeter
sense
of
the
african
magic
than
she
had
felt
till
now
and
the
certainty
that
the
greater
force
and
sweetness
of
her
feeling
were
caused
by
the
fact
that
she
had
a
companion
in
her
contemplation
this
was
strange
an
intense
desire
for
loneliness
had
driven
her
out
of
europe
to
this
desert
place
and
a
companion
who
was
an
utter
stranger
emphasised
the
significance
gave
fibre
to
the
beauty
intensity
to
the
mystery
of
that
which
she
looked
on
it
was
as
if
the
meaning
of
the
african
evening
were
suddenly
doubled
she
thought
of
a
who
throws
one
die
and
turns
up
six
then
throws
two
and
turns
up
twelve
and
she
remained
silent
in
her
surprise
the
man
stood
silently
beside
her
afterwards
she
felt
as
if
during
this
silence
in
the
tower
some
powerful
and
unseen
being
had
arrived
mysteriously
introduced
them
to
one
another
and
mysteriously
departed
the
evening
drew
on
in
their
silence
and
the
dream
was
deeper
now
all
that
domini
had
felt
when
first
she
approached
the
parapet
she
felt
more
strangely
and
she
grasped
with
physical
and
mental
vision
not
only
the
whole
but
the
innumerable
parts
of
that
which
she
looked
on
she
saw
fancifully
the
circles
widen
in
the
pool
of
peace
but
she
saw
also
the
things
that
had
been
hidden
in
the
pool
the
beauty
of
dimness
the
beauty
of
clearness
joined
hands
the
one
and
the
other
were
with
her
like
sisters
she
heard
the
voices
from
below
and
surely
also
the
voices
of
the
stars
that
were
approaching
with
the
night
blending
harmoniously
and
making
a
music
in
the
air
the
glowing
sky
and
the
glowing
mountains
were
as
comrades
each
responsive
to
the
emotions
of
the
other
the
lights
in
the
rocky
clefts
had
messages
for
the
shadowy
moon
and
the
palm
trees
for
the
thin
clouds
about
the
west
far
off
the
misty
purple
of
the
desert
drew
surely
closer
like
a
mother
coming
to
fold
her
children
in
her
arms
the
jewess
still
danced
upon
the
roof
to
the
watching
zouaves
but
now
there
was
something
mystic
in
her
tiny
movements
which
no
longer
roused
in
domini
any
furtive
desire
not
really
inherent
in
her
nature
there
was
something
beautiful
in
everything
seen
from
this
altitude
in
this
wondrous
evening
light
presently
without
turning
to
her
companion
she
said
could
anything
look
ugly
in
from
here
at
this
hour
do
you
think
again
there
was
the
silence
that
seemed
characteristic
of
this
man
before
he
spoke
as
if
speech
were
very
difficult
to
him
i
believe
not
even
that
woman
down
there
on
that
roof
looks
graceful
the
one
dancing
for
those
he
did
not
answer
she
glanced
at
him
and
pointed
down
there
do
you
see
she
noticed
that
he
did
not
follow
her
hand
and
that
his
face
became
stern
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
trees
of
the
garden
of
the
gazelles
near
cardinal
lavigerie
s
statue
and
replied
yes
his
manner
made
her
think
that
perhaps
he
had
seen
the
dance
at
close
quarters
and
that
it
was
outrageous
for
a
moment
she
felt
slightly
uncomfortable
but
determined
not
to
let
him
remain
under
a
false
impression
she
added
carelessly
i
have
never
seen
the
dances
of
africa
i
daresay
i
should
think
them
ugly
enough
if
i
were
near
but
from
this
height
everything
is
that
is
true
there
was
an
odd
muttering
sound
in
his
voice
which
was
deep
and
probably
strong
but
which
he
kept
low
domini
thought
it
was
the
most
male
voice
she
had
ever
heard
it
seemed
to
be
full
of
sex
like
his
hands
yet
there
was
nothing
coarse
in
either
the
one
or
the
other
everything
about
him
was
vital
to
a
point
that
was
so
remarkable
as
to
be
not
actually
unnatural
but
very
near
the
unnatural
she
glanced
at
him
again
he
was
a
big
man
but
very
thin
her
experienced
eyes
of
an
athletic
woman
told
her
that
he
was
capable
of
great
and
prolonged
muscular
exertion
he
was
and
and
had
nervous
as
well
as
muscular
strength
the
timidity
in
him
was
strange
in
such
a
man
what
could
it
spring
from
it
was
not
like
ordinary
shyness
the
of
a
big
awkward
lout
unaccustomed
to
woman
s
society
but
able
to
be
at
his
ease
and
boisterous
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
men
domini
thought
that
he
would
be
timid
even
of
men
yet
it
never
struck
her
that
he
might
be
a
coward
unmanly
such
a
quality
would
have
sickened
her
at
once
and
she
knew
she
would
have
at
once
divined
it
he
did
not
hold
himself
very
well
but
was
inclined
to
stoop
and
to
keep
his
head
low
as
if
he
were
in
the
habit
of
looking
much
on
the
ground
the
idiosyncrasy
was
rather
ugly
and
suggested
melancholy
to
her
the
melancholy
of
a
man
given
to
meditation
and
afraid
to
face
the
radiant
wonder
of
life
she
caught
herself
up
at
this
last
thought
she
thinking
naturally
that
life
was
full
of
radiant
wonder
was
she
then
so
utterly
transformed
already
by
or
had
the
thought
come
to
her
because
she
stood
side
by
side
with
someone
whose
sorrows
had
been
unfathomably
deeper
than
her
own
and
so
who
all
unconsciously
gave
her
a
knowledge
of
her
own
till
then
unsuspected
hopefulness
she
looked
at
her
companion
again
he
seemed
to
have
relinquished
his
intention
of
leaving
her
and
was
standing
quietly
beside
her
staring
towards
the
desert
with
his
head
slightly
drooped
forward
in
one
hand
he
held
a
thick
stick
he
had
put
his
hat
on
again
his
attitude
was
much
calmer
than
it
had
been
already
he
seemed
more
at
ease
with
her
she
was
glad
of
that
she
did
not
ask
herself
why
but
the
intense
beauty
of
evening
in
this
land
and
at
this
height
made
her
wish
enthusiastically
that
it
could
produce
a
happiness
such
as
it
created
in
her
in
everyone
such
beauty
with
its
voices
its
colours
its
lines
of
tree
and
leaf
of
wall
and
mountain
ridge
its
mystery
of
shapes
and
movements
stillness
and
dreaming
distance
its
atmosphere
of
the
far
off
come
near
chastened
by
journeying
fine
with
the
unfamiliar
its
solemn
changes
towards
the
impenetrable
night
was
too
large
a
thing
and
fraught
with
too
much
tender
and
lovable
invention
to
be
worshipped
in
any
selfishness
it
made
her
feel
as
if
she
could
gladly
be
a
martyr
for
unseen
human
beings
as
if
sacrifice
would
be
an
easy
thing
if
made
for
those
to
whom
such
beauty
would
appeal
brotherhood
rose
up
and
cried
in
her
as
it
surely
sang
in
the
sunset
in
the
mountains
the
palm
groves
and
the
desert
the
flame
above
the
hills
their
purple
outline
the
moving
feathery
trees
dark
under
the
glory
of
the
west
and
most
of
all
the
immeasurably
remote
horizons
each
moment
more
strange
and
more
eternal
made
her
long
to
make
this
harsh
stranger
happy
one
ought
to
find
happiness
here
she
said
to
him
very
simply
she
saw
his
hand
strain
itself
round
the
wood
of
his
stick
why
he
said
he
turned
right
round
to
her
and
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
anger
why
should
you
suppose
so
he
added
speaking
quite
quickly
and
without
his
former
uneasiness
and
consciousness
because
it
is
so
beautiful
and
so
calm
he
said
here
there
was
a
sound
of
passionate
surprise
in
his
voice
domini
was
startled
she
felt
as
if
she
were
fighting
and
must
fight
hard
if
she
were
not
to
be
beaten
to
the
dust
but
when
she
looked
at
him
she
could
find
no
weapons
she
said
nothing
in
a
moment
he
spoke
again
you
find
calm
here
he
said
slowly
yes
i
his
head
dropped
lower
and
his
face
hardened
as
he
looked
over
the
edge
of
the
parapet
to
the
village
the
blue
desert
then
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
mountains
and
the
clear
sky
and
the
shadowy
moon
each
element
in
the
evening
scene
was
examined
with
a
fierce
painful
scrutiny
as
if
he
was
resolved
to
wring
from
each
its
secret
why
yes
he
added
in
a
low
muttering
voice
full
of
a
sort
of
terrified
surprise
it
is
so
you
are
right
why
yes
it
is
calm
he
spoke
like
a
man
who
had
been
suddenly
convinced
beyond
power
of
further
unbelief
of
something
he
had
never
suspected
never
dreamed
of
and
the
conviction
seemed
to
be
bitter
to
him
even
alarming
but
away
out
there
must
be
the
real
home
of
peace
i
think
domini
said
where
said
the
man
quickly
she
pointed
towards
the
south
in
the
depths
of
the
desert
she
said
far
away
from
civilisation
far
away
from
modern
men
and
modern
women
and
all
the
noisy
trifles
we
are
accustomed
he
looked
towards
the
south
eagerly
in
everything
he
did
there
was
a
flamelike
intensity
as
if
he
could
not
perform
an
ordinary
action
or
turn
his
eyes
upon
any
object
without
calling
up
in
his
mind
or
heart
a
violence
of
thought
or
of
feeling
you
think
it
you
think
there
would
be
peace
out
there
far
away
in
the
desert
he
said
and
his
face
relaxed
slightly
as
if
in
obedience
to
some
thought
not
wholly
sad
it
may
be
fanciful
she
replied
but
i
think
there
must
surely
nature
has
not
a
lying
he
was
still
gazing
towards
the
south
from
which
the
night
was
slowly
emerging
a
traveller
through
a
mist
of
blue
he
seemed
to
be
held
fascinated
by
the
desert
which
was
fading
away
gently
like
a
mystery
which
had
drawn
near
to
the
light
of
revelation
but
which
was
now
slipping
back
into
an
underworld
of
magic
he
bent
forward
as
one
who
watches
a
departure
in
which
he
longs
to
share
and
domini
felt
sure
that
he
had
forgotten
her
she
felt
too
that
this
man
was
gripped
by
the
desert
influence
more
fiercely
even
than
she
was
and
that
he
must
have
a
stronger
imagination
a
greater
force
of
projection
even
than
she
had
where
she
bore
a
taper
he
lifted
a
blazing
torch
a
roar
of
drums
rose
up
immediately
beneath
them
from
the
negro
village
emerged
a
ragged
procession
of
men
and
singing
capering
women
tricked
out
in
scarlet
and
yellow
shawls
headed
by
a
male
dancer
clad
in
the
skins
of
jackals
and
decorated
with
mirrors
camels
skulls
and
chains
of
animals
teeth
he
shouted
and
leaped
rolled
his
bulging
eyes
and
protruded
a
fluttering
tongue
the
dust
curled
up
round
his
stamping
naked
feet
the
howling
chorus
came
up
to
the
tower
with
a
clash
of
enormous
castanets
and
of
poles
beaten
rhythmically
together
went
the
shrill
voices
of
the
women
the
cloud
of
dust
increased
enveloping
the
lower
part
of
the
procession
till
the
black
heads
and
waving
arms
emerged
as
if
from
a
maelstrom
the
thunder
of
the
drums
was
like
the
thunder
of
a
cataract
in
which
the
singers
disappearing
towards
the
village
seemed
to
be
swept
away
the
man
at
domini
s
side
raised
himself
up
with
a
jerk
and
all
the
former
fierce
timidity
and
consciousness
came
back
to
his
face
he
turned
round
pulled
open
the
door
behind
him
and
took
off
his
hat
excuse
me
madame
he
said
bon
soir
i
am
coming
too
domini
answered
he
looked
uncomfortable
and
anxious
hesitated
then
as
if
driven
to
do
it
in
spite
of
himself
plunged
downward
through
the
narrow
doorway
of
the
tower
into
the
darkness
domini
waited
for
a
moment
listening
to
the
heavy
sound
of
his
tread
on
the
wooden
stairs
she
frowned
till
her
thick
eyebrows
nearly
met
and
the
corners
of
her
lips
turned
down
then
she
followed
slowly
when
she
was
on
the
stairs
and
the
footsteps
died
away
below
her
she
fully
realised
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
a
man
had
insulted
her
her
face
felt
suddenly
very
hot
and
her
lips
very
dry
and
she
longed
to
use
her
physical
strength
in
a
way
not
wholly
feminine
in
the
hall
among
the
shrouded
furniture
she
met
the
smiling
doorkeeper
she
stopped
did
the
gentleman
who
has
just
gone
out
give
you
his
card
she
said
abruptly
the
arab
assumed
a
fawning
servile
expression
no
madame
but
he
is
a
very
good
gentleman
and
i
know
well
that
monsieur
the
count
domini
cut
him
short
of
what
nationality
is
he
monsieur
the
count
madame
no
the
gentleman
i
do
not
know
but
he
can
speak
arabic
oh
he
is
a
very
nice
bon
soir
said
domini
giving
him
a
franc
when
she
was
out
on
the
road
in
front
of
the
hotel
she
saw
the
stranger
striding
along
in
the
distance
at
the
tail
of
the
negro
procession
the
dust
stirred
up
by
the
dancers
whirled
about
him
several
small
negroes
skipped
round
him
doubtless
making
eager
demands
upon
his
generosity
he
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
them
and
as
she
watched
him
domini
was
reminded
of
his
retreat
from
the
praying
arab
in
the
desert
that
morning
is
he
afraid
of
women
as
he
is
afraid
of
prayer
she
thought
and
suddenly
the
sense
of
humiliation
and
anger
left
her
and
was
succeeded
by
a
powerful
curiosity
such
as
she
had
never
felt
before
about
anyone
she
realised
that
this
curiosity
had
dawned
in
her
almost
at
the
first
moment
when
she
saw
the
stranger
and
had
been
growing
ever
since
one
circumstance
after
another
had
increased
it
till
now
it
was
definite
concrete
she
wondered
that
she
did
not
feel
ashamed
of
such
a
feeling
so
unusual
in
her
and
surely
unworthy
like
a
prying
thing
of
all
her
old
indifference
that
side
which
confronted
people
had
always
been
the
most
sturdy
the
most
solidly
built
without
affectation
she
had
been
a
profoundly
incurious
woman
as
to
the
lives
and
the
concerns
of
others
even
of
those
whom
she
knew
best
and
was
supposed
to
care
for
most
her
nature
had
been
essentially
languid
in
human
intercourse
the
excitements
troubles
even
the
passions
of
others
had
generally
stirred
her
no
more
than
a
distant
stirs
an
passer
in
the
street
in
africa
it
seemed
that
her
whole
nature
had
been
either
violently
renewed
or
even
changed
she
could
not
tell
which
but
this
strong
stirring
of
curiosity
would
she
believed
have
been
impossible
in
the
woman
she
had
been
but
a
week
ago
the
woman
who
travelled
to
marseilles
dulled
ignorant
of
herself
longing
for
change
perhaps
instead
of
being
angry
she
ought
to
welcome
it
as
a
symptom
of
the
she
longed
for
while
she
changed
her
gown
for
dinner
that
night
she
debated
within
herself
how
she
would
treat
her
when
she
met
him
in
the
she
ought
to
cut
him
after
what
had
occurred
she
supposed
then
it
seemed
to
her
that
to
do
so
would
be
undignified
and
would
give
him
the
impression
that
he
had
the
power
to
offend
her
she
resolved
to
bow
to
him
if
they
met
face
to
face
just
before
she
went
downstairs
she
realised
how
vehement
her
internal
debate
had
been
and
was
astonished
suzanne
was
putting
away
something
in
a
drawer
bending
down
and
stretching
out
her
plump
arms
suzanne
domini
said
yes
mam
zelle
how
long
have
you
been
with
me
three
years
mam
the
maid
shut
the
drawer
and
turned
round
fixing
her
shallow
eyes
on
her
mistress
and
standing
as
if
she
were
ready
to
be
photographed
would
you
say
that
i
am
the
same
sort
of
person
as
i
was
three
years
ago
suzanne
looked
like
a
cat
that
has
been
startled
by
a
sudden
noise
the
same
mam
zelle
yes
do
you
think
i
have
altered
in
that
time
suzanne
considered
the
question
with
her
head
slightly
on
one
side
only
here
mam
zelle
she
replied
at
length
here
said
domini
rather
eagerly
why
i
have
only
been
here
that
is
true
but
mam
zelle
looks
as
if
she
had
a
little
life
here
a
little
emotion
mon
dieu
mam
zelle
will
pardon
me
but
what
is
a
woman
who
feels
no
emotion
a
packet
is
it
not
so
mam
zelle
well
but
what
is
there
to
be
emotional
about
here
suzanne
looked
vaguely
crafty
who
knows
mam
zelle
who
can
say
mon
dieu
this
village
is
dull
but
it
is
odd
no
band
plays
there
are
no
shops
for
a
girl
to
look
into
there
is
nothing
chic
except
the
costumes
of
the
zouaves
but
one
can
not
deny
that
it
is
odd
when
mam
zelle
was
away
this
afternoon
in
the
tower
monsieur
helmuth
who
is
that
the
monsieur
who
accompanies
the
omnibus
to
the
station
monsieur
helmuth
was
polite
enough
to
escort
me
through
the
village
mon
dieu
mam
zelle
i
said
to
myself
anything
might
occur
anything
what
do
you
mean
but
suzanne
did
not
seem
to
know
she
only
made
her
figure
look
more
tense
than
ever
tucked
in
her
round
little
chin
which
was
dimpled
and
unmeaning
and
said
who
knows
mam
zelle
this
village
is
dull
that
is
true
but
it
is
odd
one
does
not
find
oneself
in
such
places
every
domini
could
not
help
laughing
at
these
delphic
utterances
but
she
went
downstairs
thoughtfully
she
knew
suzanne
s
practical
spirit
till
now
the
maid
had
never
shown
any
capacity
of
imagination
was
certainly
beginning
to
mould
her
nature
into
a
slightly
different
shape
and
domini
seemed
to
see
an
eastern
potter
at
work
squatting
in
the
sun
and
with
long
and
delicate
fingers
changing
the
outline
of
the
statuette
of
a
woman
modifying
a
curve
here
an
angle
there
till
the
clay
began
to
show
another
woman
but
with
as
it
were
the
shadow
of
the
former
one
lurking
behind
the
new
personality
the
stranger
was
not
at
dinner
his
table
was
laid
and
domini
sat
expecting
each
moment
to
hear
the
shuffling
tread
of
his
heavy
boots
on
the
wooden
floor
when
he
did
not
come
she
thought
she
was
glad
after
dinner
she
spoke
for
a
moment
to
the
priest
and
then
went
upstairs
to
the
verandah
to
take
coffee
she
found
batouch
there
he
had
renounced
his
determined
air
and
his
countenance
and
huge
body
expressed
enduring
pathos
as
of
an
injured
patient
creature
laid
out
for
the
trampling
of
domini
s
cruel
feet
well
she
said
sitting
down
by
the
basket
table
well
madame
he
sighed
and
looked
on
the
ground
lifted
one
foot
removed
its
yellow
slipper
shook
out
a
tiny
stone
from
the
slipper
and
put
it
on
again
slowly
gracefully
and
very
sadly
then
he
pulled
the
white
sock
up
with
both
hands
and
glanced
at
domini
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
what
s
the
matter
madame
does
not
care
to
see
the
dances
of
to
hear
the
music
to
listen
to
the
to
enter
the
cafe
of
el
hadj
where
achmed
sings
to
the
keef
smokers
or
to
witness
the
beautiful
religious
ecstasies
of
the
dervishes
from
oumach
therefore
i
come
to
bid
madame
respectfully
goodnight
and
to
take
my
he
threw
his
burnous
over
his
left
shoulder
with
a
sudden
gesture
of
despair
that
was
full
of
exaggeration
domini
smiled
you
ve
been
very
good
she
said
i
am
always
good
madame
i
am
of
a
serious
disposition
not
one
keeps
ramadan
as
i
i
am
sure
of
it
go
downstairs
and
wait
for
me
under
the
batouch
s
large
face
became
suddenly
a
rendezvous
of
all
the
gaieties
madame
is
coming
out
presently
be
in
the
he
swept
away
with
the
ample
magnificence
of
joyous
bearing
and
movement
that
was
like
a
loud
te
deum
suzanne
suzanne
domini
had
finished
her
coffee
mam
zelle
answered
suzanne
appearing
would
you
like
to
come
out
with
me
mam
zelle
is
going
out
yes
to
see
the
village
by
suzanne
looked
irresolute
craven
fear
and
curiosity
fought
a
battle
within
her
as
was
evident
by
the
expressions
that
came
and
went
in
her
face
before
she
answered
shall
we
not
be
murdered
mam
zelle
and
are
there
interesting
things
to
see
there
are
interesting
things
to
see
dancers
singers
keef
smokers
but
if
you
are
afraid
don
t
dancers
mam
zelle
but
the
arabs
carry
knives
and
is
there
singing
i
i
should
not
like
mam
zelle
to
go
without
me
but
come
and
protect
me
from
the
knives
then
bring
my
jacket
any
one
i
don
t
suppose
i
shall
put
it
as
she
spoke
the
distant
tomtoms
began
suzanne
started
nervously
and
looked
at
domini
with
sincere
apprehension
we
had
better
not
go
mam
zelle
it
is
not
safe
out
here
men
who
make
a
noise
like
that
would
not
respect
i
like
that
sound
but
it
is
always
the
same
and
there
is
no
music
in
perhaps
there
is
more
in
it
than
music
the
jacket
suzanne
went
gingerly
to
fetch
it
the
faint
cry
of
the
african
hautboy
rose
up
above
the
tomtoms
the
evening
was
beginning
domini
felt
that
she
must
go
to
the
distant
music
and
learn
to
understand
its
meaning
not
only
for
herself
but
for
those
who
made
it
and
danced
to
it
night
after
night
it
stirred
her
imagination
and
made
her
in
love
with
mystery
and
anxious
at
least
to
steal
to
the
very
threshold
of
the
barbarous
world
did
it
stir
those
who
had
had
it
in
their
ears
ever
since
they
were
naked
sunburned
babies
rolling
in
the
hot
sun
of
the
sahara
could
it
seem
as
ordinary
to
them
as
the
cold
uproar
of
the
to
the
urchins
of
whitechapel
or
the
whine
of
the
fiddle
to
the
peasants
of
touraine
where
suzanne
was
born
she
wanted
to
know
suzanne
returned
with
the
jacket
she
still
looked
apprehensive
but
she
had
put
on
her
hat
and
fastened
a
sprig
of
red
geranium
in
the
front
of
her
black
gown
the
curiosity
was
in
the
ascendant
we
are
not
going
quite
alone
mam
zelle
no
no
batouch
will
protect
suzanne
breathed
a
furtive
sigh
the
poet
was
in
the
white
arcade
with
hadj
who
looked
both
wicked
and
deplorable
and
had
a
shabby
air
in
marked
contrast
to
batouch
s
ostentatious
triumph
domini
felt
quite
sorry
for
him
you
come
with
us
too
she
said
hadj
squared
his
shoulders
and
instantly
looked
vivacious
and
almost
smart
but
an
undecided
expression
came
into
his
face
where
is
madame
going
to
see
the
batouch
shot
a
glance
at
hadj
and
smiled
unpleasantly
i
will
come
with
batouch
still
smiled
we
are
going
to
the
ouled
nails
he
said
significantly
to
hadj
i
i
will
they
set
out
suzanne
looked
gently
at
the
poet
s
legs
and
seemed
comforted
take
great
care
of
mademoiselle
suzanne
domini
said
to
the
poet
she
is
a
little
nervous
in
the
mademoiselle
suzanne
is
like
the
first
day
after
the
fast
of
ramadan
replied
the
poet
majestically
no
one
would
harm
her
were
she
to
wander
alone
to
the
prospect
drew
from
suzanne
a
startled
gulp
batouch
placed
himself
tenderly
at
her
side
and
they
set
out
domini
walking
behind
with
hadj
chapter
viii
the
village
was
full
of
the
wan
presage
of
the
coming
of
the
moon
the
night
was
very
still
and
very
warm
as
they
skirted
the
long
gardens
domini
saw
a
light
in
the
priest
s
house
it
made
her
wonder
how
he
passed
his
solitary
evenings
when
he
went
home
from
the
hotel
and
she
fancied
him
sitting
in
some
little
room
with
and
a
few
books
smoking
a
pipe
and
thinking
sadly
of
the
white
fathers
of
africa
and
of
his
frustrated
desire
for
complete
renunciation
with
this
last
thought
blended
the
still
remote
sound
of
the
hautboy
it
suggested
anything
rather
than
renunciation
mysterious
melancholy
successor
to
passion
the
cry
of
longing
the
wail
of
the
unknown
that
draws
some
men
and
women
to
splendid
follies
and
to
ardent
pilgrimages
whose
goal
is
the
mirage
hadj
was
talking
in
a
low
voice
but
domini
did
not
listen
to
him
she
was
vaguely
aware
that
he
was
abusing
batouch
saying
that
he
was
a
liar
inclined
to
theft
a
keef
smoker
and
in
a
general
way
steeped
to
the
lips
in
crime
but
the
moon
was
rising
the
distant
music
was
becoming
more
distinct
she
could
not
listen
to
hadj
as
they
turned
into
the
street
of
the
the
first
ray
of
the
moon
fell
on
the
white
road
far
away
at
the
end
of
the
street
domini
could
see
the
black
foliage
of
the
trees
in
the
gazelles
garden
and
beyond
to
the
left
a
dimness
of
shadowy
palms
at
the
desert
edge
the
desert
itself
was
not
visible
two
arabs
passed
shrouded
in
burnouses
with
the
hoods
drawn
up
over
their
heads
only
their
black
beards
could
be
seen
they
were
talking
violently
and
waving
their
arms
suzanne
shuddered
and
drew
close
to
the
poet
her
plump
face
worked
and
she
glanced
appealingly
at
her
mistress
but
domini
was
not
thinking
of
her
or
of
violence
or
danger
the
sound
of
the
tomtoms
and
hautboys
seemed
suddenly
much
louder
now
that
the
moon
began
to
shine
making
a
whiteness
among
the
white
houses
of
the
village
the
white
robes
of
the
inhabitants
a
greater
whiteness
on
the
white
road
that
lay
before
them
and
she
was
thinking
that
the
moon
whiteness
of
was
more
passionate
than
pure
more
like
the
blanched
face
of
a
lover
than
the
cool
pale
cheek
of
a
virgin
there
was
excitement
in
it
suggestion
greater
even
than
the
suggestion
of
the
tremendous
coloured
scenes
of
the
evening
that
preceded
such
a
night
and
she
mused
of
white
heat
and
of
what
it
means
the
white
heat
of
the
brain
blazing
with
thoughts
that
govern
the
white
heat
of
the
heart
blazing
with
emotions
that
make
such
thoughts
seem
cold
she
had
never
known
either
was
she
incapable
of
knowing
them
could
she
imagine
them
till
there
was
physical
heat
in
her
body
if
she
was
incapable
of
knowing
them
suzanne
and
the
two
arabs
were
distant
shadows
to
her
when
that
first
touched
their
feet
the
passion
of
the
night
began
to
burn
her
and
she
thought
she
would
like
to
take
her
soul
and
hold
it
out
to
the
white
flame
as
they
passed
the
s
house
domini
saw
his
spectral
figure
standing
under
the
yellow
light
of
the
hanging
lantern
in
the
middle
of
his
carpet
shop
which
was
lined
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
dull
red
embroideries
and
dim
with
the
fumes
of
an
incense
brazier
he
was
talking
to
a
little
boy
but
keeping
a
wary
eye
on
the
street
and
he
came
out
quickly
beckoning
with
his
long
hands
and
calling
softly
in
a
and
yet
authoritative
voice
venez
madame
venez
come
come
suzanne
seized
domini
s
arm
not
domini
called
out
yes
madame
the
vie
of
madame
is
there
in
the
sand
je
la
vois

la
vois
c
est
la

le
sable
the
moonlight
showed
the
wound
on
his
face
suzanne
uttered
a
cry
and
hid
her
eyes
with
her
hands
they
went
on
towards
the
trees
hadj
walked
with
hesitation
how
loud
the
music
is
getting
domini
said
to
him
it
will
deafen
madame
s
ears
if
she
gets
nearer
said
hadj
eagerly
and
the
dancers
are
not
for
madame
for
the
arabs
yes
but
for
a
great
lady
of
the
most
respectable
england
madame
will
be
red
with
disgust
with
anger
madame
will
have
batouch
began
to
look
like
an
idol
on
whose
large
face
the
artificer
had
carved
an
expression
of
savage
ferocity
madame
is
my
client
he
said
fiercely
madame
trusts
in
hadj
laughed
with
a
snarl
he
who
smokes
the
keef
is
like
a
mehari
with
a
swollen
tongue
he
rejoined
the
poet
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
spring
upon
his
cousin
but
he
restrained
himself
and
a
slow
malignant
smile
curled
about
his
thick
lips
like
a
snake
i
shall
show
to
madame
a
dancer
who
is
modest
who
is
beautiful
he
said
softly

hadj
quickly

began
suddenly
to
gesticulate
with
his
thin
delicate
hands
and
to
look
fiercely
excited

his
teeth

had
reached
the
end
of
the
little
street
the
whiteness
of
the
great
road
which
stretched
straight
through
the
oasis
into
the
desert
lay
before
them
with
the
statue
of
cardinal
lavigerie
staring
down
it
in
the
night
at
right
angles
was
the
street
of
the
dancers
narrow
bounded
with
the
low
white
houses
of
the
ouleds
twinkling
with
starry
lights
humming
with
voices
throbbing
with
the
clashing
music
that
poured
from
the
rival
thronged
with
the
white
figures
of
the
desert
men
strolling
slowly
softly
as
panthers
up
and
down
the
moonlight
was
growing
brighter
as
if
invisible
hands
began
to
fan
the
white
flame
of
passion
which
lit
up
a
patrol
of
tirailleurs
indigenes
passed
by
going
up
the
street
in
yellow
and
blue
uniforms
turbans
and
white
gaiters
their
rifles
over
their
broad
shoulders
the
faint
tramp
of
their
marching
feet
was
just
audible
on
the
sandy
road
hadj
can
go
home
if
he
is
afraid
of
anything
in
the
dancing
street
said
domini
rather
maliciously
let
us
follow
the
hadj
started
as
if
he
had
been
stung
and
looked
at
domini
as
if
he
would
like
to
strangle
her
i
am
afraid
of
nothing
he
exclaimed
proudly
madame
does
not
know
batouch
laughed
soundlessly
shaking
his
great
shoulders
it
was
evident
that
he
had
divined
his
cousin
s
wish
to
supplant
him
and
was
busily
taking
his
revenge
domini
was
amused
and
as
they
went
slowly
up
the
street
in
the
wake
of
the
soldiers
she
said
do
you
often
come
here
at
night
oh
yes
madame
when
i
am
alone
but
with
ladies
you
were
here
last
night
weren
t
you
with
the
traveller
from
the
hotel
no
madame
the
monsieur
of
the
hotel
preferred
to
visit
the
cafe
of
the
which
is
far
more
interesting
if
madame
will
permit
me
to
take
her
but
this
last
assault
was
too
much
for
the
poet
s
philosophy
he
suddenly
threw
off
all
pretence
of
graceful
calm
and
poured
out
upon
hadj
a
torrent
of
vehement
arabic
accompanying
it
with
passionate
gestures
which
filled
suzanne
with
horror
and
domini
with
secret
delight
she
liked
this
abrupt
unveiling
of
the
raw
there
had
always
lurked
in
her
an
audacity
a
quick
spirit
of
adventure
more
boyish
than
feminine
she
had
reached
the
age
of
without
ever
gratifying
it
or
even
fully
realising
how
much
she
longed
to
gratify
it
but
now
she
began
to
understand
it
and
to
feel
that
it
was
imperious
i
have
a
barbarian
in
me
she
thought
batouch
she
said
sharply
the
poet
turned
a
distorted
face
to
her
madame
that
will
do
take
us
to
the
batouch
shot
a
last
ferocious
glance
at
hadj
and
they
went
on
into
the
crowd
of
strolling
men
the
little
street
bright
with
the
lamps
of
the
small
houses
from
which
projected
wooden
balconies
painted
in
gay
colours
and
with
the
glowing
radiance
of
the
moon
was
mysterious
despite
its
gaiety
its
obvious
dedication
to
the
cult
of
pleasure
alive
with
the
shrieking
sounds
of
music
the
movement
and
the
murmur
of
desert
humanity
made
it
almost
solemn
this
crowd
of
boys
and
men
robed
in
white
from
head
to
heel
preserved
a
serious
grace
in
its
vivacity
suggested
besides
a
dignified
barbarity
a
mingling
of
angel
monk
and
nocturnal
spirit
in
the
distance
of
the
moonbeams
gliding
slowly
over
the
dusty
road
with
slippered
feet
there
was
something
soft
and
radiant
in
their
moving
whiteness
nearer
their
pointed
hoods
made
them
monastical
as
a
procession
stealing
from
a
range
of
cells
to
chant
a
midnight
mass
in
the
shadowy
dusk
of
the
tiny
side
alleys
they
were
like
wandering
ghosts
intent
on
unholy
errands
or
returning
to
the
graveyard
on
some
of
the
balconies
painted
girls
were
leaning
and
smoking
cigarettes
before
each
of
the
lighted
doorways
from
which
the
shrill
noise
of
music
came
small
intent
crowds
were
gathered
watching
the
performance
that
was
going
on
inside
the
robes
of
the
arabs
brushed
against
the
skirts
of
domini
and
suzanne
and
eyes
stared
at
them
from
every
side
with
a
scrutiny
that
was
less
impudent
than
seriously
bold
madame
hadj
s
thin
hand
was
pulling
domini
s
sleeve
well
what
is
it
this
is
the
best
the
children
dance
domini
s
height
enabled
her
to
peer
over
the
shoulders
of
those
gathered
before
the
door
and
in
the
lighted
distance
of
a
room
painted
with
figures
of
soldiers
and
arab
chiefs
she
saw
a
small
wriggling
figure
between
two
rows
of
squatting
men
two
baby
hands
waving
coloured
handkerchiefs
two
little
feet
tapping
vigorously
upon
an
earthen
floor
for
background
a
divan
crowded
with
women
and
musicians
with
inflated
cheeks
and
squinting
eyes
she
stood
for
a
moment
to
look
then
she
turned
away
there
was
an
expression
of
disgust
in
her
eyes
no
i
don
t
want
to
see
children
she
said
that
s
too
she
glanced
at
her
escort
and
did
not
finish
i
know
said
batouch
madame
wishes
for
the
real
he
led
them
across
the
street
hadj
followed
reluctantly
before
going
into
this
second
domini
stopped
again
to
see
from
outside
what
it
was
like
but
only
for
an
instant
then
a
brightness
came
into
her
eyes
an
eager
look
yes
take
me
in
here
she
said
batouch
laughed
softly
and
hadj
uttered
a
word
below
his
breath
madame
will
see
irena
here
said
batouch
pushing
the
watching
arabs
unceremoniously
away
domini
did
not
answer
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
man
who
was
sitting
in
a
corner
far
up
the
room
bending
forward
and
staring
intently
at
a
woman
who
was
in
the
act
of
stepping
down
from
a
raised
platform
decorated
with
lamps
and
small
bunches
of
flowers
in
earthen
pots
i
wish
to
sit
quite
near
the
door
she
whispered
to
batouch
as
they
went
in
but
it
is
much
better
do
what
i
tell
you
she
said
the
left
side
of
the
hadj
looked
a
little
happier
suzanne
was
clinging
to
his
arm
he
smiled
at
her
with
something
of
mischief
but
he
took
care
when
a
place
was
cleared
on
a
bench
for
their
party
to
sit
down
at
the
end
next
the
door
and
he
cast
an
anxious
glance
towards
the
platform
where
the
attached
to
the
cafe
sat
in
a
row
hunched
up
against
the
bare
wall
waiting
their
turn
to
perform
then
suddenly
he
shook
his
head
tucked
in
his
chin
and
laughed
his
whole
face
was
transformed
from
craven
fear
to
vivacious
rascality
while
he
laughed
he
looked
at
batouch
who
was
ordering
four
cups
of
coffee
from
the
negro
attendant
the
poet
took
no
notice
for
the
moment
he
was
intent
upon
his
professional
duties
but
when
the
coffee
was
brought
and
set
upon
a
round
wooden
stool
between
two
bunches
of
roses
he
had
time
to
note
hadj
s
sudden
gaiety
and
to
realise
its
meaning
instantly
he
spoke
to
the
negro
in
a
low
voice
hadj
stopped
laughing
the
negro
sped
away
and
returned
with
the
proprietor
of
the
cafe
a
stout
kabyle
with
a
fair
skin
and
blue
eyes
batouch
lowered
his
voice
to
a
guttural
whisper
and
spoke
in
arabic
while
hadj
shifting
uneasily
on
the
end
seat
glanced
at
him
sideways
out
of
his
eyes
domini
heard
the
name
irena
and
guessed
that
batouch
was
asking
the
kabyle
to
send
for
her
and
make
her
dance
she
could
not
help
being
amused
for
a
moment
by
the
comedy
of
intrigue
complacently
malignant
on
both
sides
that
was
being
played
by
the
two
cousins
but
the
moment
passed
and
left
her
engrossed
absorbed
and
not
merely
by
the
novelty
of
the
surroundings
by
the
strangeness
of
the
women
of
their
costumes
and
of
their
movements
she
watched
them
but
she
watched
more
closely
more
eagerly
rather
as
a
spy
than
as
a
spectator
one
who
was
watching
them
with
an
intentness
a
still
passion
a
fierce
curiosity
and
a
sort
of
almost
helpless
wonder
such
as
she
had
never
seen
before
and
could
never
have
found
within
herself
to
put
at
the
service
of
any
human
marvel
close
to
the
top
of
the
room
on
the
right
the
stranger
was
sitting
in
the
midst
of
a
mob
of
arabs
whose
flowing
draperies
almost
concealed
his
ugly
european
clothes
on
the
wall
immediately
behind
him
was
a
drawing
of
a
fat
ouled
nail
leering
at
a
french
soldier
which
made
an
unconventional
background
to
his
leaning
figure
and
sunburnt
face
in
which
there
seemed
now
to
be
both
asceticism
and
something
so
different
and
so
powerful
that
it
was
likely
from
moment
to
moment
to
drive
out
the
asceticism
and
to
achieve
the
loneliness
of
all
conquering
things
this
fighting
expression
made
domini
think
of
a
picture
she
had
once
seen
representing
a
pilgrim
going
through
a
dark
forest
attended
by
his
angel
and
his
devil
the
angel
of
the
pilgrim
was
a
weak
and
almost
childish
figure
frail
bloodless
scarcely
even
radiant
while
the
devil
was
lusty
and
bold
with
a
muscular
body
and
a
sensual
aquiline
face
which
smiled
craftily
looking
at
the
pilgrim
there
was
surely
a
devil
in
the
watching
traveller
which
was
pushing
the
angel
out
of
him
domini
had
never
before
seemed
to
see
clearly
the
legendary
battle
of
the
human
heart
but
it
had
never
before
been
manifested
to
her
audaciously
in
the
human
face
all
around
the
arabs
sat
motionless
and
at
ease
gazing
on
the
curious
dance
of
which
they
never
tire
a
dance
which
has
some
ingenuity
much
sensuality
and
provocation
but
little
beauty
and
little
mystery
unless
as
happens
now
and
then
an
woman
of
the
south
with
all
the
enigma
of
the
distant
desert
in
her
eyes
dances
it
with
the
sultry
gloom
of
a
sphinx
and
makes
of
it
a
barbarous
manifestation
of
the
nature
that
lies
hidden
in
the
heart
of
the
sun
a
silent
cry
uttered
by
a
savage
body
born
in
a
savage
land
in
the
cafe
of
tahar
the
kabyle
there
was
at
present
no
such
woman
his
beauties
huddled
together
on
their
narrow
bench
before
a
table
decorated
with
glasses
of
water
and
sprigs
of
orange
blossom
in
earthen
vases
looked
dull
and
cheerless
in
their
gaudy
clothes
their
bodies
were
well
formed
but
somnolent
their
painted
hands
hung
down
like
the
hands
of
marionettes
the
one
who
was
dancing
suggested
duty
clad
in
eastern
garb
and
laying
herself
out
carefully
to
be
wicked
her
jerks
and
wrigglings
though
violent
were
inhuman
like
those
of
a
complicated
piece
of
mechanism
devised
by
a
morbid
engineer
after
a
glance
or
two
at
her
domini
felt
that
she
was
bored
by
her
own
agilities
domini
s
wonder
increased
when
she
looked
again
at
the
traveller
for
it
was
this
dance
of
the
of
the
east
which
raised
up
in
him
this
obvious
battle
which
drove
his
secret
into
the
illumination
of
the
hanging
lamps
and
gave
it
to
a
woman
who
felt
half
confused
half
ashamed
at
possessing
it
and
yet
could
not
cast
it
away
if
they
both
lived
on
without
speaking
or
meeting
for
another
half
century
domini
could
never
know
the
shape
of
the
devil
in
this
man
the
light
of
the
smile
upon
its
face
the
dancing
woman
had
observed
him
and
presently
she
began
slowly
to
wriggle
towards
him
between
the
rows
of
arabs
fixing
her
eyes
upon
him
and
parting
her
scarlet
lips
in
a
greedy
smile
as
she
came
on
the
stranger
evidently
began
to
realise
that
he
was
her
bourne
he
had
been
leaning
forward
but
when
she
approached
waving
her
red
hands
shaking
her
prominent
breasts
and
violently
jerking
her
stomach
he
sat
straight
up
and
then
as
if
instinctively
trying
to
get
away
from
her
pressed
back
against
the
wall
hiding
the
painting
of
the
ouled
nail
and
the
french
soldier
a
dark
flush
rose
on
his
face
and
even
flooded
his
forehead
to
his
hair
his
eyes
were
full
of
a
piteous
anxiety
and
discomfort
and
he
glanced
almost
guiltily
to
right
and
left
of
him
as
if
he
expected
the
hooded
arab
spectators
to
condemn
his
presence
there
now
that
the
dancer
drew
their
attention
to
it
the
dancer
noticed
his
confusion
and
seemed
pleased
by
it
and
moved
to
more
energetic
demonstrations
of
her
art
she
lifted
her
arms
above
her
head
half
closed
her
eyes
assumed
an
expression
of
languid
ecstasy
and
slowly
shuddered
then
bending
backward
she
nearly
touched
the
floor
swung
round
still
bending
and
showed
the
long
curve
of
her
bare
throat
to
the
stranger
while
the
girls
huddled
on
the
bench
by
the
musicians
suddenly
roused
themselves
and
joined
their
voices
in
a
shrill
and
prolonged
twitter
the
arabs
did
not
smile
but
the
deepness
of
their
attention
seemed
to
increase
like
a
cloud
growing
darker
all
the
luminous
eyes
in
the
room
were
steadily
fixed
upon
the
man
leaning
back
against
the
hideous
picture
on
the
wall
and
the
gaudy
siren
curved
almost
into
an
arch
before
him
the
musicians
blew
their
hautboys
and
beat
their
tomtoms
more
violently
and
all
things
domini
thought
were
filled
with
a
sense
of
climax
she
felt
as
if
the
room
all
the
inanimate
objects
and
all
the
animate
figures
in
it
were
instruments
of
an
orchestra
and
as
if
each
individual
instrument
was
contributing
to
a
slow
and
great
and
irresistible
crescendo
the
stranger
took
his
part
with
the
rest
but
against
his
will
and
as
if
under
some
terrible
compulsion
his
face
was
scarlet
now
and
his
shining
eyes
looked
down
on
the
dancer
s
throat
and
breast
with
a
mingling
of
eagerness
and
horror
slowly
she
raised
herself
turned
bent
forwards
quivering
and
presented
her
face
to
him
while
the
women
twittered
once
more
in
chorus
he
still
stared
at
her
without
moving
the
hautboy
players
prolonged
a
wailing
note
and
the
tomtoms
gave
forth
a
fierce
and
dull
murmur
almost
like
a
death
roll
she
wants
him
to
give
her
money
batouch
whispered
to
domini
why
does
not
he
give
her
money
evidently
the
stranger
did
not
understand
what
was
expected
of
him
the
music
changed
again
to
a
shrieking
tune
the
dancer
drew
back
did
a
few
more
steps
jerked
her
stomach
with
fury
stamped
her
feet
on
the
floor
then
once
more
she
shuddered
slowly
half
closed
her
eyes
glided
close
to
the
stranger
and
falling
down
deliberately
laid
her
head
on
his
knees
while
again
the
women
twittered
and
the
long
note
of
the
hautboys
went
through
the
room
like
a
scream
of
interrogation
domini
grew
hot
as
she
saw
the
look
that
came
into
the
stranger
s
face
when
the
woman
touched
his
knees
go
and
tell
him
it
s
money
she
wants
she
whispered
to
batouch
go
and
tell
him
batouch
got
up
but
at
this
moment
a
roguish
arab
boy
who
sat
by
the
stranger
laughingly
spoke
to
him
pointing
to
the
woman
the
stranger
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
found
a
coin
and
directed
by
the
roguish
youth
stuck
it
upon
the
dancer
s
greasy
forehead
at
once
she
sprang
to
her
feet
the
women
twittered
the
music
burst
into
a
triumphant
melody
and
through
the
room
there
went
a
stir
almost
everyone
in
it
moved
simultaneously
one
man
raised
his
hand
to
his
hood
and
settled
it
over
his
forehead
another
put
his
cigarette
to
his
lips
another
picked
up
his
coffeecup
a
fourth
who
was
holding
a
flower
lifted
it
to
his
nose
and
smelt
it
no
one
remained
quite
still
with
the
stranger
s
action
a
strain
had
been
removed
a
mental
tension
abruptly
loosened
a
sense
of
care
let
free
in
the
room
domini
felt
it
acutely
the
last
few
minutes
had
been
painful
to
her
she
sighed
with
relief
at
the
cessation
of
another
s
agony
for
the
stranger
had
certainly
from
shyness
or
whatever
cause
been
in
agony
while
the
dancer
kept
her
head
upon
his
knees
his
angel
had
been
in
fear
perhaps
while
his
devil
but
domini
tried
resolutely
to
turn
her
thoughts
from
the
smiling
face
after
pressing
the
money
on
the
girl
s
forehead
the
man
made
a
movement
as
if
he
meant
to
leave
the
room
but
once
again
the
curious
indecision
which
domini
had
observed
in
him
before
cut
his
action
as
it
were
in
two
leaving
it
half
finished
as
the
dancer
turning
wriggled
slowly
to
the
platform
he
buttoned
up
his
jacket
with
a
sort
of
hasty
resolution
pulled
it
down
with
a
jerk
glanced
swiftly
round
and
rose
to
his
feet
domini
kept
her
eyes
on
him
and
perhaps
they
drew
his
for
just
as
he
was
about
to
step
into
the
narrow
aisle
that
led
to
the
door
he
saw
her
instantly
he
sat
down
again
turned
so
that
she
could
only
see
part
of
his
face
unbuttoned
his
jacket
took
out
some
matches
and
busied
himself
in
lighting
a
cigarette
she
knew
he
had
felt
her
concentration
on
him
and
was
angry
with
herself
had
she
really
a
spy
in
her
was
she
capable
of
being
vulgarly
curious
about
a
man
a
sudden
movement
of
hadj
drew
her
attention
his
face
was
distorted
by
an
expression
that
seemed
half
angry
half
fearful
batouch
was
smiling
seraphically
as
he
gazed
towards
the
platform
suzanne
with
a
mouth
was
looking
virginally
at
her
lap
her
whole
attitude
showed
her
consciousness
of
the
many
blazing
eyes
that
were
intently
staring
at
her
the
stomach
dance
which
she
had
just
been
watching
had
amazed
her
so
much
that
she
felt
as
if
she
were
the
only
respectable
woman
in
the
world
and
as
if
no
one
would
suppose
it
unless
she
hung
out
banners
white
as
the
walls
of
s
houses
she
strove
to
do
so
and
meanwhile
from
time
to
time
cast
sideway
glances
towards
the
platform
to
see
whether
another
stomach
dance
was
preparing
she
did
not
see
hadj
s
excitement
or
the
poet
s
malignant
satisfaction
but
she
with
domini
saw
a
small
door
behind
the
platform
open
and
the
stout
kabyle
appear
followed
by
a
girl
who
was
robed
in
gold
tissue
and
decorated
with
cascades
of
golden
coins
domini
guessed
at
once
that
this
was
irena
the
returned
exile
who
wished
to
kill
hadj
and
she
was
glad
that
a
new
incident
had
occurred
to
switch
off
the
general
attention
from
the
stranger
irena
was
evidently
a
favourite
there
was
a
grave
movement
as
she
came
in
a
white
undulation
as
all
the
shrouded
forms
bent
slightly
forward
in
her
direction
only
hadj
caught
his
burnous
round
him
with
his
thin
fingers
dropped
his
chin
shook
his
hood
down
upon
his
forehead
leaned
back
against
the
wall
and
curling
his
legs
under
him
seemed
to
fall
asleep
but
beneath
his
brown
lids
and
long
black
lashes
his
furtive
eyes
followed
every
movement
of
the
girl
in
the
sparkling
robe
she
came
in
slowly
and
languidly
with
a
heavy
and
cross
expression
upon
her
face
which
was
thin
to
emaciation
and
painted
white
with
scarlet
lips
and
darkened
eyes
and
eyebrows
her
features
were
narrow
and
pointed
her
bones
were
tiny
and
her
body
was
so
slender
her
waist
so
small
that
with
her
flat
breast
and
meagre
shoulders
she
looked
almost
like
a
stick
crowned
with
a
human
face
and
hung
with
brilliant
draperies
her
hair
which
was
thick
and
dark
brown
was
elaborately
braided
and
covered
with
a
yellow
silk
handkerchief
domini
thought
she
looked
consumptive
and
was
bitterly
disappointed
in
her
appearance
for
some
unknown
reason
she
had
expected
the
woman
who
wished
to
kill
hadj
and
who
obviously
inspired
him
with
fear
to
be
a
magnificent
and
glowing
desert
beauty
this
woman
might
be
violent
she
looked
weary
anaemic
and
as
if
she
wished
to
go
to
bed
and
domini
s
contempt
for
hadj
increased
as
she
looked
at
her
to
be
afraid
of
a
thin
tired
sleepy
creature
such
as
that
was
too
pitiful
but
hadj
did
not
seem
to
think
so
he
had
pulled
his
hood
still
further
forward
and
was
now
merely
a
bundle
concealed
in
the
shade
of
suzanne
irena
stepped
on
to
the
platform
pushed
the
girl
who
sat
at
the
end
of
the
bench
till
she
moved
up
higher
sat
down
in
the
vacant
place
drank
some
water
out
of
the
glass
nearest
to
her
and
then
remained
quite
still
staring
at
the
floor
utterly
indifferent
to
the
arabs
who
were
devouring
her
with
their
eyes
no
doubt
the
eyes
of
men
had
devoured
her
ever
since
she
could
remember
it
was
obvious
that
they
meant
nothing
to
her
that
they
did
not
even
for
an
instant
disturb
the
current
of
her
dreary
thoughts
another
girl
was
dancing
a
stout
oriental
jewess
with
a
thick
hooked
nose
large
lips
and
bulging
eyes
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
newly
scoured
with
emery
powder
while
she
danced
she
sang
or
rather
shouted
roughly
an
extraordinary
melody
that
suggested
battle
murder
and
sudden
death
careless
of
onlookers
she
sometimes
scratched
her
head
or
rubbed
her
nose
without
ceasing
her
contortions
domini
guessed
that
this
was
the
girl
whom
she
had
seen
from
the
tower
dancing
upon
the
roof
in
the
sunset
distance
and
light
had
indeed
transformed
her
under
the
lamps
she
was
the
embodiment
of
all
that
was
coarse
and
greasy
even
the
pitiful
slenderness
of
irena
seemed
attractive
when
compared
with
her
billowing
charms
which
she
kept
in
a
continual
commotion
that
was
almost
terrifying
hadj
is
nearly
dead
with
fear
whispered
batouch
complacently
domini
s
lips
curled
does
not
madame
think
irena
beautiful
as
the
moon
on
the
waters
of
the
oued
indeed
i
don
t
she
replied
bluntly
and
i
think
a
man
who
can
be
afraid
of
such
a
little
thing
must
be
afraid
of
the
children
in
the
little
but
irena
is
tall
as
a
female
palm
in
tall
domini
looked
at
her
again
more
carefully
and
saw
that
batouch
spoke
the
truth
irena
was
unusually
tall
but
her
excessive
narrowness
her
tiny
bones
and
the
delicate
way
in
which
she
held
herself
deceived
the
eye
and
gave
her
a
little
appearance
so
she
is
but
who
could
be
afraid
of
her
why
i
could
pick
her
up
and
throw
her
over
that
moon
of
madame
is
strong
madame
is
like
the
lioness
but
irena
is
the
most
terrible
girl
in
all
if
she
loves
or
if
she
is
angry
the
most
terrible
in
all
the
domini
laughed
madame
does
not
know
her
said
batouch
imperturbably
but
madame
can
ask
the
arabs
many
of
the
dancers
of
are
murdered
each
season
two
or
three
but
no
man
would
try
to
murder
irena
no
man
would
the
poet
s
calm
and
unimpassioned
way
of
alluding
to
the
most
horrible
crimes
as
if
they
were
perfectly
natural
and
in
no
way
to
be
condemned
or
wondered
at
amazed
domini
even
more
than
his
statement
about
irena
why
do
they
murder
the
dancers
she
asked
quickly
for
their
jewels
at
night
in
those
little
rooms
with
the
balconies
which
madame
has
seen
it
is
easy
you
enter
in
to
sleep
there
you
close
your
eyes
you
breathe
gently
and
a
little
loud
the
woman
hears
she
is
not
afraid
she
sleeps
she
dreams
her
throat
is
like
that
he
threw
back
his
head
exposing
his
great
neck
just
before
dawn
you
draw
your
knife
from
your
burnous
you
bend
down
you
cut
the
throat
without
noise
you
take
the
jewels
the
money
from
the
box
by
the
bed
you
go
down
quietly
with
bare
feet
no
one
is
on
the
stair
you
unbar
the
door
and
there
before
you
is
the
great
the
great
the
desert
he
sipped
his
coffee
domini
looked
at
him
fascinated
suzanne
shivered
she
had
been
listening
the
loud
contralto
cry
of
the
jewess
rose
up
with
its
suggestion
of
violence
and
of
rough
indifference
and
domini
repeated
softly
the
great
with
every
moment
in
the
desert
seemed
to
become
more
more
full
of
meaning
of
variety
of
mystery
of
terror
was
it
everything
the
garden
of
god
the
great
of
murderers
she
had
called
it
on
the
tower
the
home
of
peace
in
the
gorge
of
ere
he
prayed
batouch
had
spoken
of
it
as
a
vast
realm
of
forgetfulness
where
the
load
of
memory
slips
from
the
weary
shoulders
and
vanishes
into
the
soft
gulf
of
the
sands
but
was
it
everything
then
and
if
it
was
so
much
to
her
already
in
a
night
and
a
day
what
would
it
be
when
she
knew
it
what
would
it
be
to
her
after
many
nights
and
many
days
she
began
to
feel
a
sort
of
terror
mingled
with
the
most
extraordinary
attraction
she
had
ever
known
hadj
crouched
right
back
against
the
wall
the
voice
of
the
jewess
ceased
in
a
shout
the
hautboys
stopped
playing
only
the
tomtoms
roared
hadj
can
be
happy
now
observed
batouch
in
a
voice
of
almost
satisfaction
for
irena
is
going
to
dance
look
there
is
the
little
miloud
bringing
her
the
an
arab
boy
with
a
beautiful
face
and
a
very
dark
skin
slipped
on
to
the
platform
with
two
long
pointed
knives
in
his
hand
he
laid
them
on
the
table
before
irena
between
the
bouquets
of
orange
blossom
jumped
lightly
down
and
disappeared
directly
the
knives
touched
the
table
the
hautboy
players
blew
a
terrific
blast
and
then
swelling
the
note
till
it
seemed
as
if
they
must
burst
both
themselves
and
their
instruments
swung
into
a
tremendous
and
magnificent
tune
a
tune
tingling
with
barbarity
yet
such
as
a
european
could
have
sung
or
written
down
in
an
instant
it
gripped
domini
and
excited
her
till
she
could
hardly
breathe
it
poured
fire
into
her
veins
and
set
fire
about
her
heart
it
was
triumphant
as
a
great
song
after
war
in
a
wild
land
cruel
vengeful
but
so
strong
and
so
passionately
joyous
that
it
made
the
eyes
shine
and
the
blood
leap
and
the
spirit
rise
up
and
clamour
within
the
body
clamour
for
utter
liberty
for
action
for
wide
fields
in
which
to
roam
for
long
days
and
nights
of
glory
and
of
love
for
intense
hours
of
emotion
and
of
life
lived
with
exultant
desperation
it
was
a
melody
that
seemed
to
set
the
soul
of
creation
dancing
before
an
ark
the
tomtoms
accompanied
it
with
an
irregular
but
rhythmical
roar
which
domini
thought
was
like
the
shouting
of
squadrons
of
fighting
men
irena
looked
wearily
at
the
knives
her
expression
had
not
changed
and
domini
was
amazed
at
her
indifference
the
eyes
of
everyone
in
the
room
were
fixed
upon
her
even
suzanne
began
to
be
less
virginal
in
appearance
under
the
influence
of
this
desert
song
of
triumph
domini
did
not
let
her
eyes
stray
any
more
towards
the
stranger
for
the
moment
indeed
she
had
forgotten
him
her
attention
was
fastened
upon
the
thin
creature
who
was
staring
at
the
two
knives
laid
upon
the
table
when
the
great
tune
had
been
played
right
through
once
and
a
passionate
roll
of
tomtoms
announced
its
repetition
irena
suddenly
shot
out
her
tiny
arms
brought
her
hands
down
on
the
knives
seized
them
and
sprang
to
her
feet
she
had
passed
from
lassitude
to
vivid
energy
with
an
abruptness
that
was
almost
demoniacal
and
to
an
energy
with
which
both
mind
and
body
seemed
to
blaze
then
as
the
hautboys
screamed
out
the
tune
once
more
she
held
the
knives
above
her
head
and
danced
irena
was
not
an
ouled
nail
she
was
a
kabyle
woman
born
in
the
mountains
of
djurdjura
not
far
from
the
village
of
tamouda
as
a
child
she
had
lived
in
one
of
those
chimneyless
and
windowless
mud
cottages
with
red
tiled
roofs
which
are
so
characteristic
a
feature
of
la
grande
kabylie
she
had
climbed
barefoot
the
savage
hills
or
descended
into
the
gorges
yellow
with
the
broom
plant
and
dipped
her
brown
toes
in
the
waters
of
the
sebaou
how
had
she
drifted
so
far
from
the
sharp
spurs
of
her
native
hills
and
from
the
people
of
her
tribe
possibly
she
had
sinned
as
the
kabyle
women
often
sin
and
fled
from
the
wrath
that
she
would
understand
and
that
all
her
fierce
bravery
could
not
hope
to
conquer
or
perhaps
with
her
kabyle
blood
itself
a
brew
composed
of
various
strains
greek
roman
as
well
as
berber
were
mingling
some
drops
drawn
from
desert
sources
which
had
manifested
themselves
physically
in
her
dark
hair
mentally
in
a
nomadic
instinct
which
had
forbidden
her
to
rest
among
the
beauties
of
ait
ouaguennoun
whose
legendary
charm
she
did
not
possess
there
was
the
look
of
an
exile
in
her
face
a
weariness
that
dreamed
perhaps
of
distant
things
but
now
that
she
danced
that
fled
and
the
gleam
of
steel
was
in
her
eyes
tangled
and
vital
impressions
came
to
domini
as
she
watched
now
she
saw
jael
and
the
tent
and
the
nails
driven
into
the
temples
of
the
sleeping
warrior
now
she
saw
medea
in
the
moment
before
she
tore
to
pieces
her
brother
and
threw
the
bloody
fragments
in
aetes
s
path
clytemnestra
s
face
while
agamemnon
was
passing
to
the
bath
delilah
s
when
samson
lay
sleeping
on
her
knee
but
all
these
imagined
faces
of
named
women
fled
like
sand
grains
on
a
desert
wind
as
the
dance
went
on
and
the
recurrent
melody
came
back
and
back
and
back
with
a
savage
and
glorious
persistence
they
were
too
small
too
individual
and
pinned
the
imagination
down
too
closely
this
dagger
dance
let
in
upon
her
a
larger
atmosphere
in
which
one
human
being
was
as
nothing
even
a
goddess
or
a
siren
prodigal
of
enchantments
was
a
little
thing
not
without
a
narrow
meanness
of
physiognomy
she
looked
and
listened
till
she
saw
a
grander
procession
troop
by
garlanded
with
mystery
and
triumph
war
as
a
shape
with
woman
s
eyes
night
without
poppies
leading
the
stars
and
moon
and
all
the
vigorous
dreams
that
must
come
true
love
of
woman
that
can
not
be
set
aside
but
will
govern
the
world
from
eden
to
the
abyss
into
which
the
nations
fall
to
the
outstretched
hands
of
god
death
as
life
s
leader
with
a
staff
from
which
sprang
blossoms
red
as
the
western
sky
savage
fecundity
that
crushes
all
barren
things
into
the
silent
dust
and
then
the
desert
that
came
in
a
pale
cloud
of
sand
with
a
pale
crowd
of
worshippers
those
who
had
received
gifts
from
the
desert
s
hands
and
sought
for
more
marabouts
who
had
found
allah
in
his
garden
and
become
a
guide
to
the
faithful
through
all
the
circling
years
murderers
who
had
gained
sanctuary
with
barbaric
jewels
in
their
hands
once
tortured
men
and
women
who
had
cast
away
terrible
recollections
in
the
wastes
among
the
dunes
and
in
the
treeless
purple
distances
and
who
had
been
granted
the
sweet
oases
of
forgetfulness
to
dwell
in
ardent
beings
who
had
striven
vainly
to
rest
content
with
the
world
of
hills
and
valleys
of
verges
and
murmuring
rivers
and
who
had
been
driven
by
the
labouring
soul
on
and
on
towards
the
flat
plains
where
roll
for
ever
the
golden
wheels
of
the
chariot
of
the
sun
she
saw
too
the
winds
that
are
the
desert
s
children
health
with
shining
eyes
and
a
skin
of
bronze
passion
half
faun
half
hercules
and
liberty
with
upraised
arms
beating
cymbals
like
monstrous
spheres
of
fire
and
she
saw
palm
trees
waving
immense
palm
trees
in
the
south
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
travelled
as
far
away
from
as
she
had
travelled
from
england
in
coming
to
she
made
her
way
towards
the
sun
joining
the
pale
crowd
of
the
desert
s
worshippers
and
always
as
she
travelled
she
heard
the
clashing
of
the
cymbals
of
liberty
a
conviction
was
born
in
her
that
fate
meant
her
to
know
the
desert
well
strangely
well
that
the
desert
was
waiting
calmly
for
her
to
come
to
it
and
receive
that
which
it
had
to
give
to
her
that
in
the
desert
she
would
learn
more
of
the
meaning
of
life
than
she
could
ever
learn
elsewhere
it
seemed
to
her
suddenly
that
she
understood
more
clearly
than
hitherto
in
what
lay
the
intense
the
and
hypnotic
attraction
exercised
already
by
the
desert
over
her
nature
in
the
desert
there
must
be
there
was
she
felt
it
not
only
light
to
warm
the
body
but
light
to
illuminate
the
dark
places
of
the
soul
an
almost
fatalistic
idea
possessed
her
she
saw
a
figure
one
of
the
messengers
standing
with
her
beside
the
corpse
of
her
father
and
whispering
in
her
ear
taking
her
to
the
map
and
pointing
to
the
word
there
filling
her
brain
and
heart
with
suggestions
till
as
she
had
thought
almost
without
reason
and
at
haphazard
she
chose
as
the
place
to
which
she
would
go
in
search
of
recovery
of
it
had
been
the
messenger
had
been
sent
the
messenger
had
guided
her
and
he
would
come
again
when
the
time
was
ripe
and
lead
her
on
into
the
desert
she
felt
it
she
knew
it
she
looked
round
at
the
arabs
she
was
as
much
a
fatalist
as
any
one
of
them
she
looked
at
the
stranger
what
was
he
abruptly
in
her
imagination
a
vision
rose
she
gazed
once
more
into
the
crowd
that
thronged
about
the
desert
having
received
gifts
at
the
desert
s
hands
and
in
it
she
saw
the
stranger
he
was
kneeling
his
hands
were
stretched
out
his
head
was
bowed
and
he
was
praying
and
while
he
prayed
liberty
stood
by
him
smiling
and
her
fiery
cymbals
were
like
the
aureoles
that
illumine
the
beautiful
faces
of
the
saints
for
some
reason
that
she
could
not
understand
her
heart
began
to
beat
fast
and
she
felt
a
burning
sensation
behind
her
eyes
she
thought
that
this
extraordinary
music
that
this
amazing
dance
excited
her
too
much
the
white
bundle
at
suzanne
s
side
stirred
irena
holding
the
daggers
above
her
head
had
sprung
from
the
little
platform
and
was
dancing
on
the
earthen
floor
in
the
midst
of
the
arabs
her
thin
body
shook
convulsively
in
time
to
the
music
she
marked
the
accents
with
her
shudders
excitement
had
grown
in
her
till
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
feverish
passion
that
was
half
exultant
half
despairing
in
her
expression
in
her
movements
in
the
way
she
held
herself
leaning
backwards
with
her
face
looking
up
her
breast
and
neck
exposed
as
if
she
offered
her
life
her
love
and
all
the
mysteries
in
her
to
an
imagined
being
who
dominated
her
savage
and
ecstatic
soul
there
was
a
vivid
suggestion
of
the
two
elements
in
passion
rapture
and
melancholy
in
her
dance
she
incarnated
passion
whole
by
conveying
the
two
halves
that
compose
it
her
eyes
were
nearly
closed
as
a
woman
closes
them
when
she
has
seen
the
lips
of
her
lover
descending
upon
hers
and
her
mouth
seemed
to
be
receiving
the
fiery
touch
of
another
mouth
in
this
moment
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
because
she
looked
like
womanhood
and
domini
understood
why
the
arabs
thought
her
more
beautiful
than
the
other
dancers
she
had
what
they
had
not
genius
and
genius
under
whatever
form
shows
to
the
world
at
moments
the
face
of
aphrodite
she
came
slowly
nearer
and
those
by
the
platform
turned
round
to
follow
her
with
their
eyes
hadj
s
hood
had
slipped
completely
down
over
his
face
and
his
chin
was
sunk
on
his
chest
batouch
noticed
it
and
looked
angry
but
domini
had
forgotten
both
the
comedy
of
the
two
cousins
and
the
tragedy
of
irena
s
love
for
hadj
she
was
completely
under
the
fascination
of
this
dance
and
of
the
music
that
accompanied
it
now
that
irena
was
near
she
was
able
to
see
that
without
her
genius
there
would
have
been
no
beauty
in
her
face
it
was
painfully
thin
painfully
long
and
haggard
her
life
had
written
a
fatal
inscription
across
it
as
their
life
writes
upon
the
faces
of
poor
children
the
one
word
want
as
they
have
too
little
this
dancing
woman
had
had
too
much
the
sparkle
of
her
robe
of
gold
tissue
covered
with
golden
coins
was
strong
in
the
lamplight
domini
looked
at
it
and
at
the
two
sharp
knives
above
her
head
looked
at
her
violent
shuddering
movements
and
shuddered
too
thinking
of
batouch
s
story
of
murdered
dancers
it
was
dangerous
to
have
too
much
in
irena
was
quite
close
now
she
seemed
so
wrapped
in
the
ecstasy
of
the
dance
that
it
did
not
occur
to
domini
at
first
that
she
was
imitating
the
ouled
nail
who
had
laid
her
greasy
head
upon
the
stranger
s
knees
the
abandonment
of
her
performance
was
so
great
that
it
was
difficult
to
remember
its
money
value
to
her
and
to
tahar
the
fair
kabyle
only
when
she
was
actually
opposite
to
them
and
stayed
there
still
performing
her
shuddering
dance
still
holding
the
daggers
above
her
head
did
domini
realise
that
those
passionate
eyes
had
marked
the
stranger
woman
and
that
she
must
add
one
to
the
stream
of
golden
coins
she
took
out
her
purse
but
did
not
give
the
money
at
once
with
the
pitiless
scrutiny
of
her
sex
she
noticed
all
the
dancer
s
disabilities
she
was
certainly
young
but
she
was
very
worn
her
mouth
drooped
at
the
corners
of
her
eyes
there
were
tiny
lines
tending
downward
her
forehead
had
what
domini
secretly
called
a
martyred
look
nevertheless
she
was
savage
and
triumphant
her
thin
body
suggested
force
the
way
she
held
herself
consuming
passion
even
so
near
at
hand
even
while
she
was
pausing
for
money
and
while
her
eyes
were
doubtless
furtively
reading
domini
she
shed
round
her
a
powerful
atmosphere
which
stirred
the
blood
and
made
the
heart
leap
and
created
longing
for
unknown
and
violent
things
as
domini
watched
her
she
felt
that
irena
must
have
lived
at
moments
magnificently
that
despite
her
almost
shattered
condition
and
permanent
weariness
only
cast
aside
for
the
moment
of
the
dance
she
must
have
known
intense
joys
that
so
long
as
she
lived
she
would
possess
the
capacity
for
knowing
them
again
there
was
something
burning
within
her
that
would
burn
on
so
long
as
she
was
alive
a
spark
of
nature
that
was
eternally
red
hot
it
was
that
spark
which
made
her
the
idol
of
the
arabs
and
shed
a
light
of
beauty
through
her
haggard
frame
the
spirit
blazed
domini
put
her
hand
at
last
into
her
purse
and
took
out
a
piece
of
gold
she
was
just
going
to
give
it
to
irena
when
the
white
bundle
that
was
hadj
made
a
sudden
though
slight
movement
as
if
the
thing
inside
it
had
shivered
irena
noticed
it
with
her
eyes
domini
leaned
forward
and
held
out
the
money
then
drew
back
startled
irena
had
changed
her
posture
abruptly
instead
of
keeping
her
head
thrown
back
and
exposing
her
long
throat
she
lifted
it
shot
it
forward
her
meagre
bosom
almost
disappeared
as
she
bent
over
her
arms
fell
to
her
sides
her
eyes
opened
wide
and
became
full
of
a
sharp
peering
intensity
her
vision
and
dreams
dropped
out
of
her
now
she
was
only
fierce
and
questioning
and
horribly
alert
she
was
looking
at
the
white
bundle
it
shifted
again
she
sprang
upon
it
showing
her
teeth
caught
hold
of
it
with
a
swift
turn
of
her
thin
hands
she
tore
back
the
hood
and
out
of
the
bundle
came
hadj
s
head
and
face
livid
with
fear
one
of
the
daggers
flashed
and
came
up
at
him
he
leaped
from
the
seat
and
screamed
suzanne
echoed
his
cry
then
the
whole
room
was
a
turmoil
of
white
garments
and
moving
limbs
in
an
instant
everybody
seemed
to
be
leaping
calling
out
grasping
struggling
domini
tried
to
get
up
but
she
was
hemmed
in
and
could
not
make
a
movement
upward
or
free
her
arms
which
were
pressed
against
her
sides
by
the
crowd
around
her
for
a
moment
she
thought
she
was
going
to
be
severely
hurt
or
suffocated
she
did
not
feel
afraid
but
only
indignant
like
a
boy
who
has
been
struck
in
the
face
and
longs
to
retaliate
someone
screamed
again
it
was
hadj
suzanne
was
on
her
feet
but
separated
from
her
mistress
batouch
s
arm
was
round
her
domini
put
her
hands
on
the
bench
and
tried
to
force
herself
up
violently
setting
her
broad
shoulders
against
the
arabs
who
were
towering
over
her
and
covering
her
head
and
face
with
their
floating
garments
as
they
strove
to
see
the
fight
between
hadj
and
the
dancer
the
heat
almost
stifled
her
and
she
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
strong
musky
smell
of
perspiring
humanity
she
was
beginning
to
pant
for
breath
when
she
felt
two
burning
hot
hard
hands
come
down
on
hers
fingers
like
iron
catch
hold
of
hers
go
under
them
drag
up
her
hands
she
could
not
see
who
had
seized
her
but
the
life
in
the
hands
that
were
on
hers
mingled
with
the
life
in
her
hands
like
one
fluid
with
another
and
seemed
to
pass
on
till
she
felt
it
in
her
body
and
had
an
odd
sensation
as
if
her
face
had
been
caught
in
a
fierce
grip
and
her
heart
too
another
moment
and
she
was
on
her
feet
and
out
in
the
moonlit
alley
between
the
little
white
houses
she
saw
the
stars
and
the
painted
balconies
crowded
with
painted
women
looking
down
towards
the
cafe
she
had
left
and
chattering
in
shrill
voices
she
saw
the
patrol
of
tirailleurs
indigenes
marching
at
the
double
to
the
doorway
in
which
the
arabs
were
still
struggling
then
she
saw
that
the
traveller
was
beside
her
she
was
not
surprised
thank
you
for
getting
me
out
she
said
rather
bluntly
where
s
my
maid
she
got
away
before
us
with
your
guide
he
held
up
his
hands
and
looked
at
them
hard
eagerly
questioningly
you
weren
t
hurt
he
dropped
his
hands
quickly
oh
no
it
wasn
t
he
broke
off
the
sentence
and
was
silent
domini
stood
still
drew
a
long
breath
and
laughed
she
still
felt
angry
and
laughed
to
control
herself
unless
she
could
be
amused
at
this
episode
she
knew
that
she
was
capable
of
going
back
to
the
door
of
the
cafe
and
hitting
out
right
and
left
at
the
men
who
had
nearly
suffocated
her
any
violence
done
to
her
body
even
an
unintentional
push
against
her
in
the
street
if
there
was
real
force
in
it
seemed
to
let
loose
a
devil
in
her
such
a
devil
as
ought
surely
only
to
dwell
inside
a
man
what
people
she
said
what
wild
creatures
she
laughed
again
the
patrol
pushed
its
way
roughly
in
at
the
doorway
the
arabs
are
always
like
that
she
looked
at
him
then
she
said
abruptly
do
you
speak
english
her
companion
hesitated
it
was
perfectly
obvious
to
her
that
he
was
considering
whether
he
should
answer
yes
or
such
hesitation
about
such
a
matter
was
very
strange
at
last
he
said
but
still
in
french
and
directly
he
had
said
it
she
saw
by
his
face
that
he
wished
he
had
said
from
the
cafe
the
arabs
began
to
pour
into
the
street
the
patrol
was
clearing
the
place
the
women
leaning
over
the
balconies
cried
out
shrilly
to
learn
the
exact
history
of
the
tumult
and
the
men
standing
underneath
and
lifting
up
their
bronzed
faces
in
the
moonlight
replied
in
violent
voices
gesticulating
vehemently
while
their
hanging
sleeves
fell
back
from
their
hairy
arms
i
am
an
englishwoman
domini
said
but
she
too
felt
obliged
to
speak
still
in
french
as
if
a
sudden
reserve
told
her
to
do
so
he
said
nothing
they
were
standing
in
quite
a
crowd
now
it
swayed
parted
suddenly
and
the
soldiers
appeared
holding
irena
hadj
followed
behind
shouting
as
if
in
a
frenzy
of
passion
there
was
some
blood
on
one
of
his
hands
and
a
streak
of
blood
on
the
front
of
the
loose
shirt
he
wore
under
his
burnous
he
kept
on
shooting
out
his
arms
towards
irena
as
he
walked
and
frantically
appealing
to
the
arabs
round
him
when
he
saw
the
women
on
their
balconies
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
called
out
to
them
like
a
man
beside
himself
a
tirailleur
pushed
him
on
the
women
who
had
been
quiet
to
hear
him
burst
forth
again
into
a
paroxysm
of
chatter
irena
looked
utterly
indifferent
and
walked
feebly
the
little
procession
disappeared
in
the
moonlight
accompanied
by
the
crowd
she
has
stabbed
hadj
domini
said
batouch
will
be
she
did
not
feel
as
if
she
were
sorry
indeed
she
thought
she
was
glad
too
that
the
dancer
should
try
to
do
a
thing
and
fail
would
have
seemed
contradictory
and
the
streak
of
blood
she
had
just
seen
seemed
to
relieve
her
suddenly
and
to
take
from
her
all
anger
her
returned
thank
you
once
more
she
said
to
her
companion
she
remembered
the
episode
of
the
tower
that
afternoon
and
resolved
to
take
a
definite
line
this
time
and
not
to
run
the
chance
of
a
second
desertion
she
started
off
down
the
street
but
found
him
walking
beside
her
in
silence
she
stopped
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
getting
me
out
she
said
looking
straight
at
him
and
now
almost
for
the
first
time
he
endured
her
gaze
without
any
uncertainty
and
she
saw
that
though
he
might
be
hesitating
uneasy
even
contemptible
as
when
he
hurried
down
the
road
in
the
wake
of
the
negro
procession
he
could
also
be
a
dogged
man
i
ll
go
with
you
madame
he
said
why
it
s
i
m
not
i
ll
go
with
you
he
said
it
again
harshly
and
kept
his
eyes
on
her
frowning
and
if
i
refuse
she
said
wondering
whether
she
was
going
to
refuse
or
not
i
ll
follow
you
she
knew
by
the
look
on
his
face
that
he
too
was
thinking
of
what
had
happened
in
the
afternoon
why
should
she
wish
to
deprive
him
of
the
reparation
he
was
anxious
to
make
obviously
anxious
in
an
almost
piteously
determined
way
it
was
poor
pride
in
her
a
mean
little
feeling
come
with
me
she
said
they
went
on
together
the
arabs
stirred
up
by
the
fracas
in
tahar
s
cafe
were
seething
with
excitement
and
several
of
them
gathered
together
in
a
little
crowd
were
quarrelling
and
shouting
at
the
end
of
the
street
near
the
statue
of
the
cardinal
domini
s
escort
saw
them
and
hesitated
i
think
madame
it
would
be
better
to
take
a
side
street
he
said
very
well
let
us
go
to
the
left
here
it
is
bound
to
bring
us
to
the
hotel
as
it
runs
parallel
to
the
house
of
the
sand
he
started
the
he
said
in
his
low
strong
voice
she
walked
on
into
a
tiny
alley
he
followed
her
you
haven
t
seen
the
thin
man
with
the
bag
of
sand
no
he
reads
your
past
in
sand
from
the
desert
and
tells
what
your
future
will
the
man
made
no
reply
will
you
pay
him
a
visit
domini
asked
curiously
no
madame
i
do
not
care
for
such
suddenly
she
stood
still
oh
look
she
said
how
strange
and
there
are
others
all
down
the
in
the
tiny
alley
the
balconies
of
the
houses
nearly
met
no
figures
leaned
on
their
railings
no
chattering
voices
broke
the
furtive
silence
that
prevailed
in
this
quarter
of
the
moonlight
was
fainter
here
obscured
by
the
buildings
and
at
the
moment
there
was
not
an
arab
in
sight
the
sense
of
loneliness
and
peace
was
profound
and
as
the
rare
windows
of
the
houses
minute
and
protected
by
heavy
gratings
were
dark
it
had
seemed
to
domini
at
first
as
if
all
the
inhabitants
were
in
bed
and
asleep
but
in
passing
on
she
had
seen
a
faint
and
blanched
illumination
then
another
the
vague
vision
of
an
aperture
a
seated
figure
making
a
darkness
against
whiteness
a
second
aperture
and
seated
figure
she
stopped
and
stood
still
the
man
stood
still
beside
her
the
alley
was
an
alley
of
women
in
every
house
on
either
side
of
the
way
a
similar
picture
of
attentive
patience
was
revealed
a
narrow
moorish
archway
with
a
wooden
door
set
back
against
the
wall
to
show
a
steep
and
diminutive
staircase
winding
up
into
mystery
upon
the
highest
stair
a
common
candlestick
with
a
lit
candle
guttering
in
it
and
immediately
below
a
girl
thickly
painted
covered
with
barbarous
jewels
and
magnificently
dressed
her
hands
tinted
with
henna
folded
in
her
lap
her
eyes
watching
under
eyebrows
heavily
darkened
and
prolonged
until
they
met
just
above
the
bridge
of
the
nose
to
which
a
number
of
black
dots
descended
her
naked
brown
ankles
decorated
with
large
circlets
of
gold
or
silver
the
candle
shed
upon
each
watcher
a
faint
light
that
half
revealed
her
and
left
her
half
concealed
upon
her
white
staircase
bounded
by
white
walls
and
in
her
absolute
silence
absolute
stillness
each
one
was
wholly
mysterious
as
she
gazed
ceaselessly
out
towards
the
empty
narrow
street
the
woman
before
whose
dwelling
domini
had
stopped
was
an
ouled
nail
with
a
square
headdress
of
coloured
handkerchiefs
and
feathers
a
pink
and
silver
shawl
a
blue
skirt
of
some
thin
material
powdered
with
silver
flowers
and
a
broad
silver
belt
set
with
squares
of
red
coral
she
was
sitting
upright
and
would
have
looked
exactly
like
an
idol
set
up
for
savage
worship
had
not
her
long
eyes
gleamed
and
moved
as
she
solemnly
returned
the
gaze
of
domini
and
of
the
man
who
stood
a
little
behind
looking
over
her
shoulder
when
domini
stopped
and
exclaimed
she
did
not
realise
to
what
this
street
was
dedicated
why
these
women
sat
in
watchful
silence
each
one
alone
on
her
stair
waiting
in
the
night
but
as
she
looked
and
saw
the
gaudy
finery
she
began
to
understand
and
had
she
remained
in
doubt
an
incident
now
occurred
which
must
have
enlightened
her
a
great
gaunt
arab
one
of
the
true
desert
men
almost
black
with
high
cheek
bones
hollow
cheeks
fierce
falcon
s
eyes
shining
as
if
with
fever
long
and
lean
limbs
hard
as
iron
dressed
in
a
rough
sacklike
brown
garment
and
wearing
a
turban
bound
with
cords
of
camel
s
hair
strode
softly
down
the
alley
slipped
in
front
of
domini
and
went
up
to
the
woman
holding
out
something
in
his
scaly
hand
there
was
a
brief
colloquy
the
woman
stretched
her
arm
up
the
staircase
took
the
candle
held
it
to
the
man
s
open
hand
and
bent
over
counting
the
money
that
lay
in
the
palm
she
counted
it
twice
deliberately
then
she
nodded
she
got
up
turned
holding
the
candle
above
her
square
headdress
and
went
slowly
up
the
staircase
followed
by
the
arab
who
grasped
his
coarse
draperies
and
lifted
them
showing
his
bare
legs
the
two
disappeared
without
noise
into
the
darkness
leaving
the
stairway
deserted
its
white
steps
its
white
walls
faintly
lit
by
the
moon
the
woman
had
not
once
looked
at
the
man
but
only
at
the
money
in
his
scaly
hand
domini
felt
hot
and
rather
sick
she
wondered
why
she
had
stood
there
watching
yet
she
had
not
been
able
to
turn
away
now
as
she
stepped
back
into
the
middle
of
the
alley
and
walked
on
with
the
man
beside
her
she
wondered
what
he
was
thinking
of
her
she
could
not
talk
to
him
any
more
she
was
too
conscious
of
the
lighted
stairways
one
after
one
succeeding
each
other
to
right
and
left
of
them
of
the
still
figures
of
the
watching
eyes
in
which
the
yellow
rays
of
the
candles
gleamed
her
companion
did
not
speak
but
as
they
walked
he
glanced
furtively
from
one
side
to
the
other
then
stared
down
steadily
on
the
white
road
when
they
turned
to
the
right
and
came
out
by
the
gardens
and
domini
saw
the
great
tufted
heads
of
the
palms
black
against
the
moon
she
felt
relieved
and
was
able
to
speak
again
i
should
like
you
to
know
that
i
am
quite
a
stranger
to
all
african
things
and
people
she
said
that
is
why
i
am
liable
to
fall
into
mistakes
in
such
a
place
as
this
ah
there
is
the
hotel
and
my
maid
on
the
verandah
i
want
to
thank
you
again
for
looking
after
they
were
at
a
few
steps
from
the
hotel
door
in
the
road
the
man
stopped
and
domini
stopped
too
madame
he
said
earnestly
with
a
sort
of
hardly
controlled
excitement
i
i
am
glad
i
was
ashamed
i
was
why
of
my
conduct
of
my
awkwardness
but
you
will
forgive
it
i
am
not
accustomed
to
the
society
of
ladies
like
you
anything
i
have
done
i
have
not
done
out
of
rudeness
that
is
all
i
can
say
i
have
not
done
it
out
of
he
seemed
to
be
almost
trembling
with
agitation
i
know
i
know
she
said
besides
it
was
oh
no
it
was
abominable
i
understand
that
i
am
not
so
as
not
to
understand
domini
suddenly
felt
that
to
take
his
view
of
the
matter
exaggerated
though
it
was
would
be
the
kindest
course
even
the
most
delicate
you
were
rude
to
me
she
said
but
i
shall
forget
it
from
this
she
held
out
her
hand
he
grasped
it
and
again
she
felt
as
if
a
furnace
were
pouring
its
fiery
heat
upon
her
madame
thank
she
was
going
away
to
the
hotel
door
but
she
stopped
my
name
is
domini
enfilden
she
said
in
english
the
man
stood
in
the
road
looking
at
her
she
waited
she
expected
him
to
tell
her
his
name
there
was
a
silence
at
last
he
said
hesitatingly
in
english
with
a
very
slight
foreign
accent
my
name
is
boris
boris
batouch
told
me
you
were
english
she
said
my
mother
was
english
but
my
father
was
a
russian
from
tiflis
that
is
my
there
was
a
sound
in
his
voice
as
if
he
were
insisting
like
a
man
making
an
assertion
not
readily
to
be
believed
domini
said
again
and
she
went
away
slowly
leaving
him
standing
on
the
moonlit
road
he
did
not
remain
there
long
nor
did
he
follow
her
into
the
hotel
after
she
had
disappeared
he
stood
for
a
little
while
gazing
up
at
the
deserted
verandah
upon
which
the
fell
then
he
turned
and
looked
towards
the
village
hesitated
and
finally
walked
slowly
back
towards
the
tiny
shrouded
alley
in
which
on
the
narrow
staircases
the
painted
girls
sat
watching
in
the
night
chapter
ix
on
the
following
morning
batouch
arrived
with
a
handsome
grey
arab
horse
for
domini
to
try
he
had
been
very
penitent
the
night
before
and
domini
had
forgiven
easily
enough
his
with
suzanne
who
had
evidently
made
a
strong
impression
upon
his
susceptible
nature
hadj
had
been
but
slightly
injured
by
irena
but
did
not
appear
at
the
hotel
for
a
very
sufficient
reason
both
the
dancer
and
he
were
locked
up
for
the
moment
till
the
guardians
of
justice
in
had
made
up
their
minds
who
should
be
held
responsible
for
the
uproar
of
the
previous
night
that
the
real
culprit
was
the
smiling
poet
was
not
likely
to
occur
to
them
and
did
not
seem
to
trouble
him
when
domini
inquired
after
hadj
he
showed
majestic
indifference
and
when
she
hinted
at
his
crafty
share
in
the
causing
of
the
tragedy
he
calmly
replied
will
know
from
henceforth
whether
the
mehari
with
the
swollen
tongue
can
then
leaping
upon
the
horse
whose
bridle
he
was
holding
he
forced
it
to
rear
caracole
and
display
its
spirit
and
its
paces
before
domini
sitting
it
superbly
and
shooting
many
sly
glances
at
suzanne
who
leaned
over
the
parapet
of
the
verandah
watching
with
a
rapt
expression
on
her
face
domini
admired
the
horse
but
wished
to
mount
it
herself
before
coming
to
any
conclusion
about
it
she
had
brought
her
own
saddle
with
her
and
ordered
batouch
to
put
it
on
the
animal
meanwhile
she
went
upstairs
to
change
into
her
habit
when
she
came
out
again
on
to
the
verandah
boris
androvsky
was
there
standing
in
the
sun
and
looking
down
at
batouch
and
the
horse
he
turned
quickly
greeted
domini
with
a
deep
bow
then
examined
her
costume
with
wondering
startled
eyes
i
m
going
to
try
that
horse
she
said
with
deliberate
friendliness
to
see
if
i
ll
buy
him
are
you
a
judge
of
a
horse
i
fear
not
she
had
spoken
in
english
and
he
replied
in
the
same
language
she
was
standing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
holding
her
whip
lightly
in
her
right
hand
her
splendid
figure
was
defined
by
the
plain
habit
and
she
saw
him
look
at
it
with
a
strange
expression
in
his
eyes
an
admiration
that
was
almost
ferocious
and
that
was
yet
respectful
and
even
pure
it
was
like
the
glance
of
a
passionate
schoolboy
verging
on
young
manhood
whose
natural
instincts
were
astir
but
whose
temperament
was
unwarped
by
vice
a
glance
that
was
a
burning
tribute
and
that
told
a
whole
story
of
sex
and
surely
of
hot
inquiring
ignorance
strange
glances
of
a
man
no
longer
even
very
young
it
made
something
in
her
leap
and
quiver
she
was
startled
and
almost
angered
by
that
but
not
by
the
eyes
that
caused
it
she
said
turning
to
go
down
may
i
might
i
see
you
get
up
said
androvsky
get
up
she
said
up
on
the
horse
she
could
not
help
smiling
at
his
fashion
of
expressing
the
act
of
mounting
he
was
not
a
sportsman
evidently
despite
his
muscular
strength
certainly
if
you
like
come
without
thinking
of
it
she
spoke
rather
as
to
a
schoolboy
not
with
superiority
but
with
the
sort
of
bluffness
age
sometimes
uses
to
youth
he
did
not
seem
to
resent
it
and
followed
her
down
to
the
arcade
the
side
saddle
was
on
and
the
poet
held
the
grey
by
the
bridle
some
arab
boys
had
assembled
under
the
arcade
to
see
what
was
going
forward
the
arab
waiter
lounged
at
the
door
with
the
tassel
of
his
fez
swinging
against
his
pale
cheek
the
horse
fidgetted
and
tugged
against
the
rein
lifting
his
delicate
feet
uneasily
from
the
ground
flicking
his
narrow
quarters
with
his
long
tail
and
glancing
sideways
with
his
dark
and
brilliant
eyes
which
were
alive
with
a
nervous
intelligence
that
was
almost
hectic
domini
went
up
to
him
and
caressed
him
with
her
hand
he
reared
up
and
snorted
his
whole
body
seemed
with
the
desire
to
gallop
furiously
away
alone
into
some
far
distant
place
androvsky
stood
near
the
waiter
looking
at
domini
and
at
the
horse
with
wonder
and
alarm
in
his
eyes
the
animal
irritated
by
inaction
began
to
plunge
violently
and
to
get
out
of
hand
give
me
the
reins
domini
said
to
the
poet
that
s
it
now
put
your
hand
for
batouch
obeyed
her
foot
just
touched
his
hand
and
she
was
in
the
saddle
androvsky
sprang
forward
on
to
the
pavement
his
eyes
were
blazing
with
anxiety
she
saw
it
and
laughed
gaily
oh
he
s
not
vicious
she
said
and
vice
is
the
only
thing
that
s
dangerous
his
mouth
is
perfect
but
he
s
nervous
and
wants
handling
i
ll
just
take
him
up
the
gardens
and
she
had
been
reining
him
in
now
she
let
him
go
and
galloped
up
the
straight
track
between
the
palms
towards
the
station
the
priest
had
come
out
into
his
little
garden
with
and
leaned
over
his
brushwood
fence
to
look
after
her
barked
in
a
light
soprano
the
arab
boys
jumped
on
their
bare
toes
and
one
of
them
who
was
a
bootblack
waved
his
board
over
his
shaven
head
the
arab
waiter
smiled
as
if
with
satisfaction
at
beholding
perfect
competence
but
androvsky
stood
quite
still
looking
down
the
dusty
road
at
the
diminishing
forms
of
horse
and
rider
and
when
they
disappeared
leaving
behind
them
a
light
cloud
of
sand
films
whirling
in
the
sun
he
sighed
heavily
and
dropped
his
chin
on
his
chest
as
if
fatigued
i
can
get
a
horse
for
monsieur
too
would
monsieur
like
to
have
a
horse
it
was
the
poet
s
amply
seductive
voice
androvsky
started
i
don
t
ride
he
said
curtly
i
will
teach
monsieur
i
am
the
best
teacher
in
in
three
lessons
monsieur
will
i
don
t
ride
i
tell
androvsky
was
looking
angry
he
stepped
out
into
the
road
who
was
now
observing
nature
at
the
priest
s
garden
gate
emerged
with
some
sprightliness
and
trotted
towards
him
evidently
with
the
intention
of
making
his
acquaintance
coming
up
to
him
the
little
dog
raised
his
head
and
uttered
a
short
bark
at
the
same
time
wagging
his
tail
in
a
kindly
though
not
effusive
manner
androvsky
looked
down
bent
quickly
and
patted
him
as
only
a
man
really
fond
of
animals
and
accustomed
to
them
knows
how
to
pat
was
openly
gratified
he
began
to
wriggle
affectionately
the
priest
in
his
garden
smiled
androvsky
had
not
seen
him
and
went
on
playing
with
the
dog
who
now
made
preparations
to
lie
down
on
his
curly
back
in
the
road
in
the
hope
of
being
tickled
a
process
he
was
an
amateur
of
still
smiling
and
with
a
friendly
look
on
his
face
the
priest
came
out
of
his
garden
and
approached
the
playmates
good
morning
m
sieur
he
said
politely
raising
his
hat
i
see
you
like
androvsky
lifted
himself
up
leaving
in
a
prayerful
attitude
his
paws
raised
devoutly
towards
the
heavens
when
he
saw
that
it
was
the
priest
who
had
addressed
him
his
face
changed
hardened
to
grimness
and
his
lips
trembled
slightly
that
s
my
little
dog
the
priest
continued
in
a
gentle
voice
he
has
evidently
taken
a
great
fancy
to
batouch
was
watching
androvsky
under
the
arcade
and
noted
the
sudden
change
in
his
expression
and
his
whole
bearing
i
i
did
not
know
he
was
your
dog
monsieur
or
i
should
not
have
interfered
with
him
said
androvsky
jumped
up
against
his
leg
he
pushed
the
little
dog
rather
roughly
away
and
stepped
back
to
the
arcade
the
priest
looked
puzzled
and
slightly
hurt
at
this
moment
the
soft
thud
of
horse
s
hoofs
was
audible
on
the
road
and
domini
came
cantering
back
to
the
hotel
her
eyes
were
sparkling
her
face
was
radiant
she
bowed
to
the
priest
and
reined
up
before
the
hotel
door
where
androvsky
was
standing
i
ll
buy
him
she
said
to
batouch
who
swelled
with
satisfaction
at
the
thought
of
his
commission
and
i
ll
go
for
a
long
ride
now
out
into
the
you
will
not
go
alone
madame
it
was
the
priest
s
voice
she
smiled
down
at
him
gaily
should
i
be
carried
off
by
nomads
monsieur
it
would
not
be
safe
for
a
lady
believe
batouch
swept
forward
to
reassure
the
priest
i
am
madame
s
guide
i
have
a
horse
ready
saddled
to
accompany
madame
i
have
sent
for
it
already
m
one
of
the
little
arab
boys
was
indeed
visible
running
with
all
his
might
towards
the
rue
berthe
domini
s
face
suddenly
clouded
the
presence
of
the
guide
would
take
all
the
edge
off
her
pleasure
and
in
the
short
gallop
she
had
just
had
she
had
savoured
its
keenness
she
was
alive
with
desire
to
be
happy
i
don
t
need
you
batouch
she
said
but
the
poet
was
inexorable
backed
up
by
the
priest
it
is
my
duty
to
accompany
madame
i
am
responsible
for
her
indeed
you
can
not
go
into
the
desert
alone
said
the
priest
domini
glanced
at
androvsky
who
was
standing
silently
under
the
arcade
a
little
withdrawn
looking
uncomfortable
and
she
remembered
her
thought
on
the
tower
of
the
and
of
how
the
presence
of
the
stranger
had
seemed
to
double
her
pleasure
then
up
the
road
from
the
rue
berthe
came
the
noise
of
a
galloping
horse
the
shoeblack
was
returning
furiously
his
bare
legs
sticking
out
on
either
side
of
a
fiery
light
chestnut
with
a
streaming
mane
and
tail
monsieur
androvsky
she
said
he
started
madame
will
you
come
with
me
for
a
ride
into
the
desert
his
face
was
flooded
with
scarlet
and
he
came
a
step
forward
looking
up
at
her
i
he
said
with
an
accent
of
infinite
surprise
yes
will
you
the
chestnut
thundered
up
and
was
pulled
sharply
back
on
its
haunches
androvsky
shot
a
sideways
glance
at
it
and
hesitated
domini
thought
he
was
going
to
refuse
and
wished
she
had
not
asked
him
wished
it
passionately
never
mind
she
said
almost
brutally
in
her
vexation
at
what
she
had
done
batouch
the
poet
was
about
to
spring
upon
the
horse
when
androvsky
caught
him
by
the
arm
i
will
go
he
said
batouch
looked
vicious
but
monsieur
told
me
he
did
not
he
stopped
the
hand
on
his
arm
had
given
him
a
wrench
that
made
him
feel
as
if
his
flesh
were
caught
between
steel
pincers
androvsky
came
up
to
the
chestnut
oh
it
s
an
arab
saddle
said
domini
it
does
not
matter
his
face
was
stern
are
you
accustomed
to
them
it
makes
no
he
took
hold
of
the
rein
and
put
his
foot
in
the
high
stirrup
but
so
awkwardly
that
he
kicked
the
horse
in
the
side
it
plunged
take
care
said
domini
androvsky
hung
on
and
climbed
somehow
into
the
saddle
coming
down
in
it
heavily
with
a
thud
the
horse
now
thoroughly
startled
plunged
furiously
and
lashed
out
with
its
hind
legs
androvsky
was
thrown
forward
against
the
high
red
peak
of
the
saddle
with
his
hands
on
the
animal
s
neck
there
was
a
struggle
he
tugged
at
the
rein
violently
the
horse
jumped
back
reared
plunged
sideways
as
if
about
to
bolt
androvsky
was
shot
off
and
fell
on
his
right
shoulder
heavily
batouch
caught
the
horse
while
androvsky
got
up
he
was
white
with
dust
there
was
even
dust
on
his
face
and
in
his
short
hair
he
looked
passionate
you
see
batouch
began
speaking
to
domini
that
monsieur
can
not
give
me
the
rein
said
androvsky
there
was
a
sound
in
his
deep
voice
that
was
terrible
he
was
looking
not
at
domini
but
at
the
priest
who
stood
a
little
aside
with
an
expression
of
concern
on
his
face
barked
with
excitement
at
the
conflict
androvsky
took
the
rein
and
with
a
sort
of
furious
determination
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
pressed
his
legs
against
the
horse
s
flanks
it
reared
up
the
priest
moved
back
under
the
palm
trees
the
arab
boys
scattered
batouch
sought
the
shelter
of
the
arcade
and
the
horse
with
a
short
whining
neigh
that
was
like
a
cry
of
temper
bolted
between
the
trunks
of
the
trees
heading
for
the
desert
and
disappeared
in
a
flash
he
will
be
killed
said
the
priest
barked
frantically
it
is
his
own
fault
said
the
poet
he
told
me
himself
just
now
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
so
domini
exclaimed
madame
but
she
was
gone
following
androvsky
at
a
slow
canter
lest
she
should
frighten
his
horse
by
coming
up
behind
it
she
came
out
from
the
shade
of
the
palms
into
the
sun
the
desert
lay
before
her
she
searched
it
eagerly
with
her
eyes
and
saw
androvsky
s
horse
far
off
in
the
river
bed
still
going
at
a
gallop
towards
the
south
towards
that
region
in
which
she
had
told
him
on
the
tower
she
thought
that
peace
must
dwell
it
was
as
if
he
had
believed
her
words
blindly
and
was
frantically
in
chase
of
peace
and
she
pursued
him
through
the
blazing
sunlight
she
was
out
in
the
desert
at
length
beyond
the
last
belt
of
verdure
beyond
the
last
line
of
palms
the
desert
wind
was
on
her
cheek
and
in
her
hair
the
desert
spaces
stretched
around
her
under
her
horse
s
hoofs
lay
the
sparkling
crystals
on
the
wrinkled
earth
the
red
rocks
seamed
with
many
shades
of
colour
that
all
suggested
primeval
fires
and
the
relentless
action
of
heat
were
heaped
about
her
but
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
moving
speck
that
was
the
horse
carrying
androvsky
madly
towards
the
south
the
light
and
fire
the
great
airs
the
sense
of
the
chase
intoxicated
her
she
struck
her
horse
with
the
whip
it
leaped
as
if
clearing
an
immense
obstacle
came
down
lightly
and
strained
forward
into
the
shining
mysteries
at
a
furious
gallop
the
black
speck
grew
larger
she
was
gaining
the
crumbling
bank
on
her
left
showed
a
rent
in
which
a
faint
track
rose
sharply
to
the
flatness
beyond
she
put
her
horse
at
it
and
came
out
among
the
tiny
humps
on
which
grew
the
halfa
grass
and
the
tamarisk
bushes
a
pale
sand
flew
up
here
about
the
horse
s
feet
androvsky
was
still
below
her
in
the
difficult
ground
where
the
water
came
in
the
floods
she
gained
and
gained
till
she
was
parallel
with
him
and
could
see
his
bent
figure
his
arms
clinging
to
the
peak
of
his
red
saddle
his
legs
set
forward
almost
on
to
his
horse
s
withers
by
the
short
stirrups
with
their
metal
toecaps
the
animal
s
temper
was
nearly
spent
she
could
see
that
the
terror
had
gone
out
of
his
pace
as
she
looked
she
saw
androvsky
raise
his
arms
from
the
saddle
peak
catch
at
the
flying
rein
draw
it
up
lean
against
the
saddle
back
and
pull
with
all
his
force
the
horse
stopped
dead
his
strength
must
be
enormous
domini
thought
with
a
startled
admiration
she
pulled
up
too
on
the
bank
above
him
and
gave
a
halloo
he
turned
his
head
saw
her
and
put
his
horse
at
the
bank
which
was
steep
here
and
without
any
gap
you
can
t
do
it
she
called
in
reply
he
dug
the
heels
of
his
heavy
boots
into
the
horse
s
flanks
and
came
on
recklessly
she
thought
the
horse
would
either
refuse
or
try
to
get
up
and
roll
back
on
its
rider
it
sprang
at
the
bank
and
mounted
like
a
wild
cat
there
was
a
noise
of
falling
stones
a
shower
of
scattered
dropping
downward
and
he
was
beside
her
white
with
dust
streaming
with
sweat
panting
as
if
the
labouring
breath
would
rip
his
chest
open
with
the
horse
s
foam
on
his
forehead
and
a
savage
and
yet
exultant
gleam
in
his
eyes
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
while
their
horses
standing
quietly
lowered
their
narrow
graceful
heads
and
touched
noses
with
delicate
inquiry
then
she
said
i
almost
thought
she
stopped
yes
he
said
on
a
great
gasping
breath
that
was
like
a
sob
that
you
were
off
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
or
i
don
t
know
what
i
thought
you
aren
t
hurt
he
could
only
speak
in
monosyllables
as
yet
she
looked
his
horse
over
he
won
t
give
much
more
trouble
just
now
shall
we
ride
back
as
she
spoke
she
threw
a
longing
glance
at
the
far
desert
at
the
verge
of
which
was
a
dull
green
line
betokening
the
distant
palms
of
an
oasis
androvsky
shook
his
head
but
you
she
hesitated
perhaps
you
aren
t
accustomed
to
horses
and
with
that
saddle
he
shook
his
head
again
drew
a
tremendous
breath
and
said
i
don
t
care
i
ll
go
on
i
won
t
go
he
put
up
one
hand
brushed
the
foam
from
his
streaming
forehead
and
said
again
fiercely
i
won
t
go
his
face
was
extraordinary
with
its
dogged
passionate
expression
showing
through
the
dust
and
the
sweat
like
the
face
of
a
man
in
a
fight
to
the
death
she
thought
a
fight
with
fists
she
was
glad
at
his
last
words
and
liked
the
iron
sound
in
his
voice
come
on
and
they
began
to
ride
towards
the
dull
green
line
of
the
oasis
slowly
on
the
sandy
waste
among
the
little
round
humps
where
the
dusty
cluster
of
bushes
grew
you
weren
t
hurt
by
the
fall
she
said
it
looked
a
bad
i
don
t
know
whether
i
was
i
don
t
care
whether
i
he
spoke
almost
roughly
you
asked
me
to
ride
with
you
he
added
i
ll
ride
with
she
remembered
what
batouch
had
said
there
was
pluck
in
this
man
pluck
that
surged
up
in
the
blundering
awkwardness
the
hesitation
the
incompetence
and
rudeness
of
him
like
a
black
rock
out
of
the
sea
she
did
not
answer
they
rode
on
always
slowly
his
horse
having
had
its
will
and
having
known
his
strength
at
the
end
of
his
incompetence
went
quietly
though
always
with
that
feathery
light
tripping
action
peculiar
to
purebred
arabs
an
action
that
suggests
the
treading
of
a
spring
board
rather
than
of
the
solid
earth
and
androvsky
seemed
a
little
more
at
home
on
it
although
he
sat
awkwardly
on
the
saddle
and
grasped
the
rein
too
much
as
the
drowning
man
seizes
the
straw
domini
rode
without
looking
at
him
lest
he
might
think
she
was
criticising
his
performance
when
he
had
rolled
in
the
dust
she
had
been
conscious
of
a
sharp
sensation
of
contempt
the
men
she
had
been
accustomed
to
meet
all
her
life
rode
shot
played
games
as
a
matter
of
course
she
was
herself
an
athlete
and
like
nearly
all
athletic
women
inclined
to
be
pitiless
towards
any
man
who
was
not
so
strong
and
so
agile
as
herself
but
this
man
had
killed
her
contempt
at
once
by
his
desperate
determination
not
to
be
beaten
she
knew
by
the
look
she
had
just
seen
in
his
eyes
that
if
to
ride
with
her
that
day
meant
death
to
him
he
would
have
done
it
nevertheless
the
womanhood
in
her
liked
the
tribute
almost
more
than
liked
it
your
horse
goes
better
now
she
said
at
last
to
break
the
silence
does
it
he
said
you
don
t
know
madame
i
know
nothing
of
horses
or
riding
i
have
not
been
on
a
horse
for
she
was
amazed
we
ought
to
go
back
then
she
exclaimed
why
other
men
ride
i
will
ride
i
do
it
badly
forgive
forgive
you
she
said
i
admire
your
pluck
but
why
have
you
never
ridden
all
these
years
after
a
pause
he
answered
i
i
did
not
i
had
not
the
his
voice
was
suddenly
constrained
she
did
not
pursue
the
subject
but
stroked
her
horse
s
neck
and
turned
her
eyes
towards
the
dark
green
line
on
the
horizon
now
that
she
was
really
out
in
the
desert
she
felt
almost
bewildered
by
it
and
as
if
she
understood
it
far
less
than
when
she
looked
at
it
from
count
anteoni
s
garden
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
sand
humps
each
crowned
with
its
dusty
dwarf
bush
each
one
precisely
like
the
others
agitated
her
as
if
she
were
confronted
by
a
vast
multitude
of
people
she
wanted
some
point
which
would
keep
the
eyes
from
travelling
but
could
not
find
it
and
was
mentally
restless
as
the
swimmer
far
out
at
sea
who
is
pursued
by
wave
on
wave
and
who
sees
beyond
him
the
unceasing
foam
of
those
that
are
pressing
to
the
horizon
whither
was
she
riding
could
one
have
a
goal
in
this
immense
expanse
she
felt
an
overpowering
need
to
find
one
and
looked
once
more
at
the
green
line
do
you
think
we
could
go
as
far
as
that
she
asked
androvsky
pointing
with
her
whip
yes
it
must
be
an
oasis
don
t
you
think
so
yes
i
can
go
keep
your
rein
loose
don
t
pull
his
mouth
you
don
t
mind
my
telling
you
i
ve
been
with
horses
all
my
thank
you
he
answered
and
keep
your
heels
more
out
that
s
much
better
i
m
sure
you
could
teach
me
a
thousand
things
it
will
be
kind
of
you
to
let
me
teach
you
he
cast
a
strange
look
at
her
there
was
gratitude
in
it
but
much
more
a
fiery
bitterness
and
something
childlike
and
helpless
i
have
nothing
to
teach
he
said
their
horses
broke
into
a
canter
and
with
the
swifter
movement
domini
felt
more
calm
there
was
an
odd
lightness
in
her
brain
as
if
her
thoughts
were
being
shaken
out
of
it
like
feathers
out
of
a
bag
the
power
of
concentration
was
leaving
her
and
a
sensation
of
carelessness
surely
came
over
her
her
body
dipped
in
the
dry
and
thin
air
as
in
a
clear
cool
bath
did
not
suffer
from
the
burning
rays
of
the
sun
but
felt
radiant
yet
half
lazy
too
they
went
on
and
on
in
silence
as
intimate
friends
might
ride
together
isolated
from
the
world
and
content
in
each
other
s
company
content
enough
to
have
no
need
of
talking
not
once
did
it
strike
domini
as
strange
that
she
should
go
far
out
into
the
desert
with
a
man
of
whom
she
knew
nothing
but
in
whom
she
had
noticed
disquieting
peculiarities
she
was
naturally
fearless
but
that
had
little
to
do
with
her
conduct
without
saying
so
to
herself
she
felt
she
could
trust
this
man
the
dark
green
line
showed
clearer
through
the
sunshine
across
the
gleaming
flats
it
was
possible
now
to
see
slight
irregularities
in
it
as
in
a
blurred
dash
of
paint
flung
across
a
canvas
by
an
uncertain
hand
but
impossible
to
distinguish
palm
trees
the
air
sparkled
as
if
full
of
a
tiny
dust
of
intensely
brilliant
jewels
and
near
the
ground
there
seemed
to
quiver
a
maze
of
dancing
specks
of
light
everywhere
there
was
solitude
yet
everywhere
there
was
surely
a
ceaseless
movement
of
minute
and
vital
things
scarce
visible
sun
fairies
eternally
at
play
and
domini
s
careless
feeling
grew
she
had
never
before
experienced
so
delicious
a
recklessness
head
and
heart
were
light
reckless
of
thought
or
love
sad
things
had
no
meaning
here
and
grave
things
no
place
for
the
blood
was
full
of
sunbeams
dancing
to
a
lilt
of
apollo
nothing
mattered
here
even
death
wore
a
robe
of
gold
and
went
with
an
airy
step
ah
yes
from
this
region
of
quivering
light
and
heat
the
arabs
drew
their
easy
and
lustrous
resignation
out
here
one
was
in
the
hands
of
a
god
who
surely
sang
as
he
created
and
had
not
created
fear
many
minutes
passed
but
domini
was
careless
of
time
as
of
all
else
the
green
line
broke
into
feathery
tufts
broadened
into
a
still
dimness
of
palms
water
androvsky
s
voice
spoke
as
if
startled
domini
pulled
up
their
horses
stood
side
by
side
and
at
once
with
the
cessation
of
motion
the
mysticism
of
the
desert
came
upon
them
and
the
marvel
of
its
silence
and
they
seemed
to
be
set
there
in
a
wonderful
dream
themselves
and
their
horses
dreamlike
water
he
said
again
he
pointed
and
along
the
edge
of
the
oasis
domini
saw
grey
calm
waters
the
palms
ran
out
into
them
and
were
bathed
by
them
softly
and
on
their
bosom
here
and
there
rose
small
dim
islets
yes
there
was
water
and
yet
the
mystery
of
it
was
a
mystery
she
had
never
known
to
brood
even
over
a
white
northern
sea
in
a
twilight
hour
of
winter
was
deeper
than
the
mystery
of
the
venetian
when
the
angelus
bell
chimes
at
sunset
and
each
distant
boat
each
bending
rower
and
patient
fisherman
becomes
a
marvel
an
eerie
thing
in
the
gold
is
it
mirage
she
said
to
him
almost
in
a
whisper
and
suddenly
she
shivered
yes
it
is
it
must
he
did
not
answer
his
left
hand
holding
the
rein
dropped
down
on
the
saddle
peak
and
he
stared
across
the
waste
leaning
forward
and
moving
his
lips
she
looked
at
him
and
forgot
even
the
mirage
in
a
sudden
longing
to
understand
exactly
what
he
was
feeling
his
mystery
the
mystery
of
that
which
is
human
and
is
forever
stretching
out
its
arms
was
as
the
fluid
mystery
of
the
mirage
and
seemed
to
blend
at
that
moment
with
the
mystery
she
knew
lay
in
herself
the
mirage
was
within
them
as
it
was
far
off
before
them
in
the
desert
still
grey
full
surely
of
indistinct
movement
and
even
perhaps
of
sound
they
could
not
hear
at
last
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
yes
it
must
be
mirage
he
said
the
nothing
that
seems
to
be
so
much
a
man
comes
out
into
the
desert
and
he
finds
there
mirage
he
travels
right
out
and
that
s
what
he
reaches
or
at
least
he
can
t
reach
it
but
just
sees
it
far
away
and
that
s
all
and
is
that
what
a
man
finds
when
he
comes
out
into
the
world
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
spoken
without
any
trace
of
reserve
to
her
for
even
on
the
tower
though
there
had
been
tumult
in
his
voice
and
a
fierceness
of
some
strange
passion
in
his
words
there
had
been
struggle
in
his
manner
as
if
the
pressure
of
feeling
forced
him
to
speak
in
despite
of
something
which
bade
him
keep
silence
now
he
spoke
as
if
to
someone
whom
he
knew
and
with
whom
he
had
talked
of
many
things
but
you
ought
to
know
better
than
i
do
she
answered
i
yes
you
are
a
man
and
have
been
in
the
world
and
must
know
what
it
has
to
give
whether
there
s
only
mirage
or
something
that
can
be
grasped
and
felt
and
lived
in
and
yes
i
m
a
man
and
i
ought
to
know
he
replied
well
i
don
t
know
but
i
mean
to
there
was
a
savage
sound
in
his
voice
i
should
like
to
know
too
domini
said
quietly
and
i
feel
as
if
it
was
the
desert
that
was
going
to
teach
the
desert
how
i
don
t
he
pointed
again
to
the
mirage
but
that
s
what
there
is
in
the
that
and
what
else
is
there
anything
else
perhaps
everything
she
answered
i
am
like
you
i
want
to
he
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
and
there
was
something
dominating
in
his
expression
you
think
it
is
the
desert
that
could
teach
you
whether
the
world
holds
anything
but
a
mirage
he
said
slowly
well
i
don
t
think
it
would
be
the
desert
that
could
teach
she
said
nothing
more
but
let
her
horse
go
and
rode
off
he
followed
and
as
he
rode
awkwardly
yet
bravely
pressing
his
strong
legs
against
his
animal
s
flanks
and
holding
his
thin
body
bent
forward
he
looked
at
domini
s
upright
figure
and
brilliant
elastic
grace
that
gave
in
to
her
horse
as
wave
gives
to
wind
with
a
passion
of
envy
in
his
eyes
they
did
not
speak
again
till
the
great
palm
gardens
of
the
oasis
they
had
seen
far
off
were
close
upon
them
from
the
desert
they
looked
both
shabby
and
superb
as
if
some
millionaire
had
poured
forth
money
to
create
a
paradise
out
here
and
when
it
was
nearly
finished
had
suddenly
repented
of
his
whim
and
refused
to
spend
another
farthing
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
mighty
trees
were
bounded
by
long
irregular
walls
of
hard
earth
at
the
top
of
which
were
stuck
distraught
thorn
bushes
these
walls
gave
the
rough
penurious
aspect
which
was
in
such
sharp
contrast
to
the
exotic
mystery
they
guarded
yet
in
the
fierce
blaze
of
the
sun
their
meanness
was
not
disagreeable
domini
even
liked
it
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
desert
had
thrown
up
waves
to
protect
this
daring
oasis
which
ventured
to
fling
its
green
glory
like
a
defiance
in
the
face
of
the
sahara
a
wide
track
of
earth
sprinkled
with
stones
and
covered
with
deep
ruts
holes
and
hummocks
wound
in
from
the
desert
between
the
earthen
walls
and
vanished
into
the
heart
of
the
oasis
they
followed
it
domini
was
filled
with
a
sort
of
romantic
curiosity
this
luxury
of
palms
far
out
in
the
midst
of
desolation
untended
apparently
by
human
hands
for
no
figures
moved
among
them
there
was
no
one
on
the
road
suggested
some
hidden
purpose
and
activity
some
concealed
personage
perhaps
an
eastern
anteoni
whose
lair
lay
surely
somewhere
beyond
them
as
she
had
felt
the
call
of
the
desert
she
now
felt
the
call
of
the
oasis
in
this
land
thrilled
eternally
a
summons
to
go
onward
to
seek
to
penetrate
to
be
a
passionate
pilgrim
she
wondered
whether
her
companion
s
heart
could
hear
it
i
don
t
know
why
it
is
she
said
but
out
here
i
always
feel
expectant
i
always
feel
as
if
some
marvellous
thing
might
be
going
to
happen
to
she
did
not
add
do
you
but
looked
at
him
as
if
for
a
reply
yes
madame
he
said
i
suppose
it
is
because
i
am
new
to
africa
this
is
my
first
visit
here
i
am
not
like
you
i
can
t
speak
she
suddenly
wondered
whether
the
desert
was
new
to
him
as
to
her
she
had
assumed
that
it
was
yet
as
he
spoke
arabic
it
was
almost
certain
that
he
had
been
much
in
africa
i
do
not
speak
it
well
he
answered
and
he
looked
away
towards
the
dense
thickets
of
the
palms
the
track
narrowed
till
the
trees
on
either
side
cast
patterns
of
moving
shade
across
it
and
the
silent
mystery
was
deepened
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
feathery
tufted
foliage
swayed
in
the
little
wind
the
desert
had
vanished
but
sent
in
after
them
the
message
of
its
soul
the
marvellous
breath
which
domini
had
drunk
into
her
lungs
so
long
before
she
saw
it
that
breath
was
like
a
presence
it
dwells
in
all
oases
the
high
earth
walls
concealed
the
gardens
domini
longed
to
look
over
and
see
what
they
contained
whether
there
were
any
dwellings
in
these
dim
and
silent
recesses
any
pools
of
water
flowers
or
grassy
lawns
her
horse
neighed
something
is
coming
she
said
they
turned
a
corner
and
were
suddenly
in
a
village
a
mob
of
children
scattered
from
their
horses
feet
rows
of
seated
men
in
white
and
robes
stared
upon
them
from
beneath
the
shadow
of
tall
windowless
earth
houses
white
dogs
rushed
to
and
fro
upon
the
flat
roofs
thrusting
forward
venomous
heads
showing
their
teeth
and
barking
furiously
hens
fluttered
in
agitation
from
one
side
to
the
other
a
grey
mule
tethered
to
a
door
and
loaded
with
brushwood
lashed
out
with
its
hoofs
at
a
negro
who
at
once
began
to
batter
it
passionately
with
a
pole
and
a
long
line
of
sneering
camels
confronted
them
treading
stealthily
and
turning
their
serpentine
necks
from
side
to
side
as
they
came
onwards
with
a
soft
and
weary
inflexibility
in
the
distance
there
was
a
vision
of
a
glaring
crowded
with
moving
forms
and
humming
with
noises
the
change
from
mysterious
peace
to
this
vivid
and
concentrated
life
was
startling
with
difficulty
they
avoided
the
onset
of
the
camels
by
pulling
their
horses
into
the
midst
of
the
dreamers
against
the
walls
who
rolled
and
scrambled
into
places
of
safety
then
stood
up
and
surrounded
them
staring
with
an
almost
terrible
interest
upon
them
and
surveying
their
horses
with
the
eyes
of
connoisseurs
the
children
danced
up
and
began
to
ask
for
alms
and
an
immense
man
with
a
broken
nose
and
brown
teeth
like
tusks
laid
a
gigantic
hand
on
domini
s
bridle
and
said
in
atrocious
french
i
am
the
guide
i
am
the
guide

at
my
certificates
take
no
one
else
the
people

english
lord

of

he
thrust
a
packet
of
discoloured
papers
and
dirty
into
her
hands
she
dropped
them
laughing
and
they
floated
down
over
the
horse
s
neck
the
man
leaped
frantically
to
pick
them
up
assisted
by
the
robbers
round
about
a
second
caravan
of
camels
appeared
preceded
by
some
filthy
men
in
rags
who
cried
oosh
oosh
to
clear
the
way
the
immense
man
brandishing
his
recovered
certificates
plunged
forward
to
encounter
them
shouting
in
arabic
hustled
them
back
kicked
them
struck
at
the
camels
with
a
stick
till
those
in
front
receded
upon
those
behind
and
the
street
was
blocked
by
struggling
beasts
and
resounded
with
roaring
snarls
the
thud
of
wooden
bales
clashing
together
and
the
desperate
protests
of
the
one
of
whom
was
sent
rolling
into
a
noisome
dust
heap
with
his
turban
torn
from
his
head
the

this
is

domini
was
standing
in
a
tiny
cabaret
before
a
row
of
absinthe
bottles
laughing
almost
breathless
she
scarcely
knew
how
she
had
come
there
looking
back
she
saw
androvsky
still
sitting
on
his
horse
in
the
midst
of
the
clamouring
mob
she
went
to
the
low
doorway
but
mustapha
barred
her
exit
this
is
madame
will
eat
in
the
garden
she
is
tired
fainting
she
will
eat
and
then
she
will
see
the
great
mosque
of
she
exclaimed
monsieur
androvsky
do
you
know
where
we
are
this
is
the
famous
where
the
great
warrior
is
buried
and
where
the
arabs
make
pilgrimages
to
worship
at
his
yes
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
as
we
are
here
we
ought
to
see
do
you
know
i
think
we
must
yield
to
honest
mustapha
and
have

the
garden
it
is
twelve
o
clock
and
i
am
hungry
we
might
visit
the
mosque
afterwards
and
ride
home
in
the
he
sat
there
hunched
up
on
the
horse
and
looked
at
her
in
silent
hesitation
while
the
arabs
stood
round
staring
you
d
rather
not
she
spoke
quietly
he
shook
his
feet
out
of
the
stirrups
a
number
of
brown
hands
and
arms
shot
forth
to
help
him
domini
turned
back
into
the
cabaret
she
heard
a
tornado
of
voices
outside
a
horse
neighing
and
trampling
a
scuffling
of
feet
but
she
did
not
glance
round
in
about
three
minutes
androvsky
joined
her
he
was
limping
slightly
and
bending
forward
more
than
ever
behind
the
counter
on
which
stood
the
absinthe
bottle
was
a
tarnished
mirror
and
she
saw
him
glance
quickly
almost
guiltily
into
it
put
up
his
hands
and
try
to
brush
the
dust
from
his
hair
his
shoulders
let
me
do
it
she
said
abruptly
turn
he
obeyed
without
a
word
turning
his
back
to
her
with
her
two
hands
which
were
covered
with
soft
loose
suede
gloves
she
beat
and
brushed
the
dust
from
his
coat
he
stood
quite
still
while
she
did
it
when
she
had
finished
she
said
there
that
s
her
voice
was
practical
he
did
not
move
but
stood
there
i
ve
done
what
i
can
monsieur
then
he
turned
slowly
and
she
saw
with
amazement
that
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
he
did
not
thank
her
or
say
a
word
a
small
and
frenchman
with
red
eyelids
and
moustaches
that
drooped
over
a
pendulous
underlip
now
begged
madame
to
follow
him
through
a
small
doorway
beyond
which
could
be
seen
three
just
shot
gazelles
lying
in
a
patch
of
sunlight
by
a
domini
went
after
him
and
androvsky
and
honest
mustapha
still
vigorously
proclaiming
his
own
virtues
brought
up
the
rear
they
came
into
the
most
curious
garden
she
had
ever
seen
it
was
long
and
narrow
and
dishevelled
without
grass
or
flowers
the
uneven
ground
of
it
was
bare
earth
hard
as
parquet
rising
here
into
a
hump
falling
there
into
a
depression
immediately
behind
the
cabaret
where
the
dead
gazelles
with
their
large
glazed
eyes
lay
by
the
was
a
rough
wooden
trellis
with
vines
trained
over
it
making
an
arbour
beyond
was
a
rummage
of
orange
trees
palms
gums
and
fig
trees
growing
at
their
own
sweet
will
and
casting
patterns
of
deep
shade
upon
the
earth
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
intense
yellow
sunlight
which
fringed
them
where
the
leafage
ceased
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
create
formal
garden
paths
and
garden
beds
by
sticking
rushes
into
little
holes
drilled
in
the
ground
but
the
paths
were
as
a
drunkard
s
walk
and
the
round
and
oblong
beds
contained
no
trace
of
plants
on
either
hand
rose
steep
walls
of
earth
higher
than
a
man
and
crowned
with
prickly
thorn
bushes
over
them
looked
palm
trees
at
the
end
of
the
garden
ran
a
slow
stream
of
muddy
water
in
a
channel
with
crumbling
banks
trodden
by
many
naked
feet
beyond
it
was
yet
another
lower
wall
of
earth
yet
another
maze
of
palms
heat
and
silence
brooded
here
like
reptiles
on
the
warm
mud
of
a
tropic
river
in
a
jungle
lizards
ran
in
and
out
of
the
innumerable
holes
in
the
walls
and
flies
buzzed
beneath
the
ragged
leaves
of
the
fig
trees
and
crawled
in
the
hot
cracks
of
the
earth
the
landlord
wished
to
put
a
table
under
the
vine
close
to
the
cabaret
wall
but
domini
begged
him
to
bring
it
to
the
end
of
the
garden
near
the
stream
with
the
furious
assistance
of
honest
mustapha
he
carried
it
there
and
quickly
laid
it
in
the
shadow
of
a
fig
tree
while
domini
and
androvsky
waited
in
silence
on
two
chairs
the
atmosphere
of
the
garden
was
hostile
to
conversation
the
sluggish
muddy
stream
the
almost
motionless
trees
the
imprisoned
heat
between
the
surrounding
walls
the
faint
buzz
of
the
flies
caused
drowsiness
to
creep
upon
the
spirit
the
long
ride
too
and
the
ardent
desert
air
made
this
repose
a
luxury
androvsky
s
face
lost
its
emotional
expression
as
he
gazed
almost
vacantly
at
the
brown
water
shifting
slowly
by
between
the
brown
banks
and
the
brown
walls
above
which
the
palm
trees
peered
his
aching
limbs
relaxed
his
hands
hung
loose
between
his
knees
and
domini
half
closed
her
eyes
a
curious
peace
descended
upon
her
lapped
in
the
heat
and
silence
for
the
moment
she
wanted
nothing
the
faint
buzz
of
the
flies
sounded
in
her
ears
and
seemed
more
silent
than
even
the
silence
to
which
it
drew
attention
never
before
not
in
count
anteoni
s
garden
had
she
felt
more
utterly
withdrawn
from
the
world
the
feathery
tops
of
the
palms
were
like
the
heads
of
sentinels
guarding
her
from
contact
with
all
that
she
had
known
and
beyond
them
lay
the
desert
the
empty
sunlit
waste
she
shut
her
eyes
and
murmured
to
herself
i
am
in
far
away
i
am
in
far
and
the
flies
said
it
in
her
ears
monotonously
and
the
lizards
whispered
it
as
they
slipped
in
and
out
of
the
little
dark
holes
in
the
walls
she
heard
androvsky
stir
and
she
moved
her
lips
slowly
and
the
flies
and
the
lizards
continued
the
refrain
but
she
said
now
we
are
in
far
honest
mustapha
strode
forward
he
had
a
tread
to
wake
up
a
world
was
ready
domini
sighed
they
took
their
places
under
the
fig
tree
on
either
side
of
the
deal
table
covered
with
a
rough
white
cloth
and
mustapha
with
tremendous
gestures
and
gigantic
postures
suggesting
the
untamed
descendant
of
legions
of
freeborn
men
served
them
with
red
fish
omelette
gazelle
steaks
cheese
oranges
and
dates
with
white
wine
and
vals
water
androvsky
scarcely
spoke
now
that
he
was
sitting
at
a
meal
with
domini
he
was
obviously
embarrassed
all
his
movements
were
he
seemed
afraid
to
eat
and
refused
the
gazelle
mustapha
broke
out
into
turbulent
surprise
and
prolonged
explanations
of
the
delicious
flavour
of
this
desert
food
but
androvsky
still
refused
looking
desperately
disconcerted
it
really
is
delicious
said
domini
who
was
eating
it
but
perhaps
you
don
t
care
about
she
spoke
quite
carelessly
and
was
surprised
to
see
him
look
at
her
as
if
with
sudden
suspicion
and
immediately
help
himself
to
the
gazelle
this
man
was
perpetually
giving
a
touch
of
the
whip
to
her
curiosity
to
keep
it
alert
yet
she
felt
oddly
at
ease
with
him
he
seemed
somehow
part
of
her
impression
of
the
desert
and
now
as
they
sat
under
the
fig
tree
between
the
high
earth
walls
and
at
their
meal
in
unbroken
silence
for
since
her
last
remark
androvsky
had
kept
his
eyes
down
and
had
not
uttered
a
word
she
tried
to
imagine
the
desert
without
him
she
thought
of
the
gorge
of
the
cold
the
darkness
and
then
the
sun
and
the
blue
country
they
had
framed
his
face
she
thought
of
the
silent
night
when
the
voice
of
the
african
hautboy
had
died
away
his
step
had
broken
its
silence
she
thought
of
the
garden
of
count
anteoni
and
of
herself
kneeling
on
the
hot
sand
with
her
arms
on
the
white
parapet
and
gazing
out
over
the
regions
of
the
sun
of
her
dream
upon
the
tower
of
her
vision
when
irena
danced
he
was
there
part
of
the
noon
part
of
the
twilight
chief
surely
of
the
worshippers
who
swept
on
in
the
pale
procession
that
received
gifts
from
the
desert
s
hands
she
could
no
longer
imagine
the
desert
without
him
the
almost
painful
feeling
that
had
come
to
her
in
the
garden
of
the
human
power
to
distract
her
attention
from
the
desert
power
was
dying
perhaps
had
completely
died
away
another
feeling
was
surely
coming
to
replace
it
that
androvsky
belonged
to
the
desert
more
even
than
the
arabs
did
that
the
desert
spirits
were
close
about
him
clasping
his
hands
whispering
in
his
ears
and
laying
their
unseen
hands
about
his
heart
but
they
had
finished
their
meal
domini
set
her
chair
once
more
in
front
of
the
sluggish
stream
while
honest
mustapha
bounded
with
motions
suggestive
of
an
ostentatious
panther
to
get
the
coffee
androvsky
followed
her
after
an
instant
of
hesitation
do
smoke
she
said
he
lit
a
small
cigar
with
difficulty
she
did
not
wish
to
watch
him
but
she
could
not
help
glancing
at
him
once
or
twice
and
the
conviction
came
to
her
that
he
was
unaccustomed
to
smoking
she
lit
a
cigarette
and
saw
him
look
at
her
with
a
sort
of
horrified
surprise
which
changed
to
staring
interest
there
was
more
boy
more
child
in
this
man
than
in
any
man
she
had
ever
known
yet
at
moments
she
felt
as
if
he
had
penetrated
more
profoundly
into
the
dark
and
winding
valleys
of
experience
than
all
the
men
of
her
acquaintance
monsieur
androvsky
she
said
looking
at
the
slow
waters
of
the
stream
slipping
by
towards
the
hidden
gardens
is
the
desert
new
to
you
she
longed
to
know
yes
i
thought
perhaps
i
wondered
a
little
whether
you
had
travelled
in
it
no
madame
i
saw
it
for
the
first
time
the
day
before
when
i
so
they
had
entered
it
for
the
first
time
together
she
was
silent
watching
the
pale
smoke
curl
up
through
the
shade
and
out
into
the
glare
of
the
sun
the
lizards
creeping
over
the
hot
earth
the
flies
circling
beneath
the
lofty
walls
the
palm
trees
looking
over
into
this
garden
from
the
gardens
all
around
gardens
belonging
to
eastern
people
born
here
and
who
would
probably
die
here
and
go
to
dust
among
the
roots
of
the
palms
on
the
earthen
bank
on
the
far
side
of
the
stream
there
appeared
while
she
gazed
a
brilliant
figure
it
came
soundlessly
on
bare
feet
from
a
hidden
garden
a
tall
unveiled
girl
dressed
in
draperies
of
vivid
magenta
who
carried
in
her
brown
hands
a
number
of
handkerchiefs
scarlet
orange
yellow
green
and
flesh
colour
she
did
not
glance
into
the
garden
but
caught
up
her
draperies
into
a
bunch
with
one
hand
exposing
her
slim
legs
far
above
the
knees
waded
into
the
stream
and
bending
dipped
the
handkerchiefs
in
the
water
the
current
took
them
they
streamed
out
on
the
muddy
surface
of
the
stream
and
tugged
as
if
suddenly
endowed
with
life
they
were
striving
to
escape
from
the
hand
that
held
them
the
girl
s
face
was
beautiful
with
small
regular
features
and
lustrous
tender
eyes
her
figure
not
yet
fully
developed
was
perfect
in
shape
and
seemed
to
thrill
softly
with
the
spirit
of
youth
her
tint
of
bronze
suggested
statuary
and
every
fresh
pose
into
which
she
fell
while
the
water
eddied
about
her
strengthened
the
suggestion
with
the
golden
sunlight
streaming
upon
her
the
brown
banks
the
brown
waters
the
brown
walls
throwing
up
the
crude
magenta
of
her
draperies
the
vivid
colours
of
the
handkerchiefs
that
floated
from
her
hand
with
the
feathery
palms
beside
her
the
cloudless
blue
sky
above
her
she
looked
so
strangely
african
and
so
completely
lovely
that
domini
watched
her
with
an
almost
breathless
attention
she
withdrew
the
handkerchiefs
from
the
stream
waded
out
and
spread
them
one
by
one
upon
the
low
earth
wall
to
dry
letting
her
draperies
fall
when
she
had
finished
disposing
them
she
turned
round
and
no
longer
preoccupied
with
her
task
looked
under
her
level
brows
into
the
garden
opposite
and
saw
domini
and
her
companion
she
did
not
start
but
stood
quite
still
for
a
moment
then
slipped
away
in
the
direction
whence
she
had
come
only
the
brilliant
patches
of
colour
on
the
wall
remained
to
hint
that
she
had
been
there
and
would
come
again
domini
sighed
what
a
lovely
creature
she
said
more
to
herself
than
to
androvsky
he
did
not
speak
and
his
silence
made
her
consciously
demand
his
acquiescence
in
her
admiration
did
you
ever
see
anything
more
beautiful
and
more
characteristic
of
africa
she
asked
madame
he
said
in
a
slow
stern
voice
i
did
not
look
at
domini
felt
piqued
why
not
she
retorted
androvsky
s
face
was
cloudy
and
almost
cruel
these
native
women
do
not
interest
me
he
said
i
see
nothing
attractive
in
domini
knew
that
he
was
telling
her
a
lie
had
she
not
seen
him
watching
the
dancing
girls
in
tahar
s
cafe
anger
rose
in
her
she
said
to
herself
then
that
it
was
anger
at
man
s
hypocrisy
afterwards
she
knew
that
it
was
anger
at
androvsky
s
telling
a
lie
to
her
i
can
scarcely
believe
that
she
answered
bluntly
they
looked
at
each
other
why
not
madame
he
said
if
i
say
it
is
so
she
hesitated
at
that
moment
she
realised
with
hot
astonishment
that
there
was
something
in
this
man
that
could
make
her
almost
afraid
that
could
prevent
her
even
perhaps
from
doing
the
thing
she
had
resolved
to
do
immediately
she
felt
hostile
to
him
and
she
knew
that
at
that
moment
he
was
feeling
hostile
to
her
if
you
say
it
is
so
naturally
i
am
bound
to
take
your
word
for
it
she
said
coldly
he
flushed
and
looked
down
the
rigid
defiance
that
had
confronted
her
died
out
of
his
face
honest
mustapha
broke
joyously
upon
them
with
the
coffee
domini
helped
androvsky
to
it
she
had
to
make
a
great
effort
to
perform
this
simple
act
with
quiet
and
apparently
indifferent
composure
thank
you
his
voice
sounded
humble
but
she
felt
hard
and
as
if
ice
were
in
all
her
veins
she
sipped
her
coffee
looking
straight
before
her
at
the
stream
the
magenta
robe
appeared
once
more
coming
out
from
the
brown
wall
a
yellow
robe
succeeded
it
a
scarlet
a
deep
purple
the
girl
with
three
curious
young
companions
stood
in
the
sun
examining
the
foreigners
with
steady
unflinching
eyes
domini
smiled
grimly
fate
gave
her
an
opportunity
she
beckoned
to
the
girls
they
looked
at
each
other
but
did
not
move
she
held
up
a
bit
of
silver
so
that
the
sun
was
on
it
and
beckoned
them
again
the
magenta
robe
was
lifted
above
the
pretty
knees
it
had
covered
the
yellow
the
scarlet
the
deep
purple
robes
rose
too
making
their
separate
revelations
and
the
four
girls
all
staring
at
the
silver
coin
waded
through
the
muddy
water
and
stood
before
domini
and
androvsky
blotting
out
the
glaring
sunshine
with
their
young
figures
their
smiling
faces
were
now
eager
and
confident
and
they
stretched
out
their
delicate
hands
hopefully
to
the
silver
domini
signified
that
they
must
wait
a
moment
she
felt
full
of
malice
the
girls
wore
many
ornaments
she
began
slowly
and
deliberately
to
examine
them
the
huge
gold
earrings
that
were
as
large
as
the
little
ears
that
sustained
them
the
bracelets
and
anklets
the
triangular
silver
skewers
that
fastened
the
draperies
across
the
gentle
swelling
breasts
the
narrow
girdles
worked
with
gold
thread
and
hung
with
lumps
of
coral
that
circled
the
small
elastic
waists
her
inventory
was
an
adagio
and
while
it
lasted
androvsky
sat
on
his
low
straw
chair
with
this
wall
of
young
womanhood
before
him
of
young
womanhood
no
longer
and
timid
but
eager
hardy
natural
warm
with
the
sun
and
damp
with
the
trickling
drops
of
the
water
the
vivid
draperies
touched
him
and
presently
a
little
hand
stole
out
to
his
breast
caught
at
the
silver
chain
that
lay
across
it
and
jerked
out
of
its
a
wooden
cross
domini
saw
the
light
on
it
for
a
second
heard
a
low
fierce
exclamation
saw
androvsky
s
arm
push
the
pretty
hand
roughly
away
and
then
a
thing
that
was
strange
he
got
up
violently
from
his
chair
with
the
cross
hanging
loose
on
his
breast
then
he
seized
hold
of
it
snapped
the
chain
in
two
threw
the
cross
passionately
into
the
stream
and
walked
away
down
the
garden
the
four
girls
with
a
twittering
cry
of
excitement
rushed
into
the
water
heedless
of
draperies
bent
down
knelt
down
and
began
to
feel
frantically
in
the
mud
for
the
vanished
ornament
domini
stood
up
and
watched
them
androvsky
did
not
come
back
some
minutes
passed
then
there
was
an
exclamation
of
triumph
from
the
stream
the
girl
in
magenta
held
up
the
dripping
cross
with
the
bit
of
silver
chain
in
her
dripping
fingers
domini
cast
a
swift
glance
behind
her
androvsky
had
disappeared
quickly
she
went
to
the
edge
of
the
water
as
she
was
in
she
wore
no
ornaments
except
two
earrings
made
of
large
and
beautiful
turquoises
she
took
them
hastily
out
of
her
ears
and
held
them
out
to
the
girl
signifying
by
gestures
that
she
bartered
them
for
the
little
cross
and
chain
the
girl
hesitated
but
the
clear
blue
tint
of
the
turquoise
pleased
her
eyes
she
yielded
snatched
the
earrings
with
an
eager
gave
up
the
cross
and
chain
with
a
reluctant
hand
domini
s
fingers
closed
round
the
wet
gold
she
threw
some
coins
across
the
stream
on
to
the
bank
and
turned
away
thrusting
the
cross
into
her
bosom
and
she
felt
at
that
moment
as
if
she
had
saved
a
sacred
thing
from
outrage
at
the
cabaret
door
she
found
androvsky
once
more
surrounded
by
arabs
whom
honest
mustapha
was
trying
to
beat
off
he
turned
when
he
heard
her
his
eyes
were
still
full
of
a
light
that
revealed
an
intensity
of
mental
agitation
and
she
saw
his
left
hand
which
hung
down
quivering
against
his
side
but
he
succeeded
in
schooling
his
voice
as
he
asked
do
you
wish
to
visit
the
village
madame
yes
but
don
t
let
me
bother
you
if
you
would
rather
i
will
come
i
wish
to
she
did
not
believe
it
she
felt
that
he
was
in
great
pain
both
of
body
and
mind
his
fall
had
hurt
him
she
knew
that
by
the
way
he
moved
his
right
arm
the
unaccustomed
exercise
had
made
him
stiff
probably
the
physical
discomfort
he
was
silently
enduring
had
acted
as
an
irritant
to
the
mind
she
remembered
that
it
was
caused
by
his
determination
to
be
her
companion
and
the
ice
in
her
melted
away
she
longed
to
make
him
calmer
happier
secretly
she
touched
the
little
cross
that
lay
under
her
habit
he
had
thrown
it
away
in
a
passion
well
some
day
perhaps
she
would
have
the
pleasure
of
giving
it
back
to
him
since
he
had
worn
it
he
must
surely
care
for
it
and
even
perhaps
for
that
which
it
recalled
we
ought
to
visit
the
mosque
i
think
she
said
yes
the
assent
sounded
determined
yet
reluctant
she
knew
this
was
all
against
his
will
mustapha
took
charge
of
them
and
they
set
out
down
the
narrow
street
accompanied
by
a
little
crowd
they
crossed
the
glaring
with
its
booths
of
red
meat
made
black
by
flies
its
heaps
of
refuse
its
rows
of
small
and
squalid
hutches
in
which
sat
serious
men
surrounded
by
their
goods
the
noise
here
was
terrific
everyone
seemed
shouting
and
the
uproar
of
the
various
trades
the
clamour
of
hammers
on
sheets
of
iron
the
dry
tap
of
the
shoemaker
s
wooden
wand
on
the
soles
of
countless
slippers
the
thud
of
the
s
blunt
club
on
the
beans
and
the
groaning
grunt
with
which
he
accompanied
each
downward
stroke
mingled
with
the
incessant
roar
of
camels
and
seemed
to
be
made
more
deafening
and
intolerable
by
the
fierce
heat
of
the
sun
and
by
the
innumerable
smells
which
seethed
forth
upon
the
air
domini
felt
her
nerves
set
on
edge
and
was
thankful
when
they
came
once
more
into
the
narrow
alleys
that
ran
everywhere
between
the
brown
blind
houses
in
them
there
was
shade
and
silence
and
mystery
mustapha
strode
before
to
show
the
way
domini
and
androvsky
followed
and
behind
glided
the
little
mob
of
barefoot
inquisitors
in
long
shirts
speechless
and
intent
and
always
hopeful
of
some
chance
scattering
of
money
by
the
wealthy
travellers
the
tumult
of
the
at
length
died
away
and
domini
was
conscious
of
a
curious
murmur
at
first
it
was
so
faint
that
she
was
scarcely
aware
of
it
and
merely
felt
the
soothing
influence
of
its
level
monotony
but
as
they
walked
on
it
grew
deeper
stronger
it
was
like
the
sound
of
countless
multitudes
of
bees
buzzing
in
the
noon
among
flowers
drowsily
ceaselessly
she
stopped
under
a
low
mud
arch
to
listen
and
when
she
listened
standing
still
a
feeling
of
awe
came
upon
her
and
she
knew
that
she
had
never
heard
such
a
strangely
impressive
strangely
suggestive
sound
before
what
is
that
she
said
she
looked
at
androvsky
i
don
t
know
madame
it
must
be
but
what
can
they
be
doing
they
are
praying
in
the
mosque
where
is
buried
said
mustapha
domini
remembered
the
this
was
the
sound
she
had
beard
in
his
sunken
chamber
infinitely
multiplied
they
went
on
again
slowly
mustapha
had
lost
something
of
his
flaring
manner
and
his
gait
was
subdued
he
walked
with
a
sort
of
soft
caution
like
a
man
approaching
holy
ground
and
domini
was
moved
by
his
sudden
reverence
it
was
impressive
in
such
a
fierce
and
greedy
scoundrel
the
level
murmur
deepened
strengthened
all
the
empty
and
dim
alleys
surrounding
the
unseen
mosque
were
alive
with
it
as
if
the
earth
of
the
houses
the
beams
the
iron
bars
of
the
tiny
shuttered
windows
the
very
thorns
of
the
brushwood
roofs
were
praying
ceaselessly
and
intently
in
secret
under
voices
this
was
a
world
intense
with
prayer
as
a
flame
is
intense
with
heat
with
prayer
penetrating
and
compelling
urgent
in
its
persistence
powerful
in
its
deep
and
sultry
concentration
yet
almost
oppressive
almost
terrible
in
its
monotony
it
was
the
murmur
of
the
desert
and
the
murmur
of
the
sun
it
was
the
whisper
of
the
mirage
and
of
the
airs
that
stole
among
the
palm
leaves
it
was
the
perpetual
of
this
world
that
was
engulfing
her
taking
her
to
its
warm
and
glowing
bosom
with
soft
and
tyrannical
intention
allah
allah
allah
surely
god
must
be
very
near
bending
to
such
an
everlasting
cry
never
before
not
even
when
the
bell
sounded
and
the
host
was
raised
had
domini
felt
the
nearness
of
god
to
his
world
the
absolute
certainty
of
a
creator
listening
to
his
creatures
watching
them
wanting
them
meaning
them
some
day
to
be
one
with
him
as
she
felt
it
now
while
she
threaded
the
dingy
alleys
towards
these
countless
men
who
prayed
androvsky
was
walking
slowly
as
if
in
pain
your
shoulder
isn
t
hurting
you
she
whispered
this
long
sound
of
prayer
moved
her
to
the
soul
made
her
feel
very
full
of
compassion
for
everybody
and
everything
and
as
if
prayer
were
a
cord
binding
the
world
together
he
shook
his
head
silently
she
looked
at
him
and
felt
that
he
was
moved
also
but
whether
as
she
was
she
could
not
tell
his
face
was
like
that
of
a
man
stricken
with
awe
mustapha
turned
round
to
them
the
everlasting
murmur
was
now
so
near
that
it
seemed
to
be
within
them
as
if
they
too
prayed
at
the
tomb
of
zerzour
follow
me
into
the
court
madame
mustapha
said
and
remain
at
the
door
while
i
fetch
the
they
turned
a
corner
and
came
to
an
open
space
before
an
archway
which
led
into
the
first
of
the
courts
surrounding
the
mosque
under
the
archway
arabs
were
sitting
silently
as
if
immersed
in
profound
reveries
they
did
not
move
but
stared
upon
the
strangers
and
domini
fancied
that
there
was
enmity
in
their
eyes
beyond
them
upon
an
uneven
pavement
surrounded
with
lofty
walls
more
arabs
were
gathered
kneeling
bowing
their
heads
to
the
ground
and
muttering
ceaseless
words
in
deep
almost
growling
voices
their
fingers
slipped
over
the
beads
of
the
chaplets
they
wore
round
their
necks
and
domini
thought
of
her
rosary
some
prayed
alone
removed
in
shady
corners
with
faces
turned
to
the
wall
others
were
gathered
into
knots
but
each
one
pursued
his
own
devotions
immersed
in
a
strange
interior
solitude
to
which
surely
penetrated
an
unseen
ray
of
sacred
light
there
were
young
boys
praying
and
old
wrinkled
men
eagles
of
the
desert
with
fierce
eyes
that
did
not
soften
as
they
cried
the
greatness
of
allah
the
greatness
of
his
prophet
but
gleamed
as
if
their
belief
were
a
thing
of
flame
and
bronze
the
boys
sometimes
glanced
at
each
other
while
they
prayed
and
after
each
glance
they
swayed
with
greater
violence
and
bowed
down
with
more
passionate
abasement
the
vision
of
prayer
had
stirred
them
to
a
young
longing
for
excess
the
spirit
of
emulation
flickered
through
them
and
turned
their
worship
into
war
in
a
second
and
smaller
court
before
the
portal
of
the
mosque
men
were
learning
the
koran
dressed
in
white
they
sat
in
circles
holding
squares
of
some
material
that
looked
like
cardboard
covered
with
minute
arab
characters
pretty
symmetrical
curves
and
lines
dots
and
dashes
the
teachers
squatted
in
the
midst
expounding
the
sacred
text
in
nasal
voices
with
a
swiftness
and
vivacity
that
seemed
pugnacious
there
was
violence
within
these
courts
domini
could
imagine
the
worshippers
springing
up
from
their
knees
to
tear
to
pieces
an
intruding
dog
of
an
unbeliever
then
sinking
to
their
knees
again
while
the
blood
trickled
over
the
pavement
and
the
lifeless
body
lay
there
to
rot
and
draw
the
flies
allah
allah
allah
there
was
something
imperious
in
such
ardent
such
concentrated
and
untiring
worship
a
demand
which
surely
could
not
be
overlooked
or
set
aside
the
tameness
the
of
western
prayer
and
western
praise
had
no
place
here
this
prayer
was
hot
as
the
sunlight
this
praise
was
a
mounting
fire
the
breath
of
this
human
incense
was
as
the
breath
of
a
furnace
pouring
forth
to
the
gates
of
the
paradise
of
allah
it
gave
to
domini
a
quite
new
conception
of
religion
of
the
relation
between
creator
and
created
the
personal
pride
which
like
blood
in
a
body
runs
through
all
the
veins
of
the
mind
of
mohammedanism
that
measureless
hauteur
which
sets
the
soul
of
a
sultan
in
the
twisted
frame
of
a
beggar
at
a
street
corner
and
makes
impressive
even
almost
majestical
the
filthy
marabout
quivering
with
palsy
and
devoured
by
disease
who
squats
beneath
a
holy
bush
thick
with
the
discoloured
rags
of
the
faithful
was
not
abased
at
the
shrine
of
the
warrior
zerzour
was
not
cast
off
in
the
act
of
adoration
these
arabs
humbled
themselves
in
the
body
their
foreheads
touched
the
stones
by
their
attitudes
they
seemed
as
if
they
wished
to
make
themselves
even
with
the
ground
to
shrink
into
the
space
occupied
by
a
grain
of
sand
yet
they
were
proud
in
the
presence
of
allah
as
if
the
firmness
of
their
belief
in
him
and
his
right
dealing
the
fury
of
their
contempt
and
hatred
for
those
who
looked
not
towards
mecca
nor
regarded
ramadan
gave
them
a
patent
of
nobility
despite
their
genuflections
they
were
all
as
men
who
knew
and
never
forgot
that
on
them
was
conferred
the
right
to
keep
on
their
in
the
presence
of
their
king
with
their
closed
eyes
they
looked
god
full
in
the
face
their
dull
and
growling
murmur
had
the
majesty
of
thunder
rolling
through
the
sky
mustapha
had
disappeared
within
the
mosque
leaving
domini
and
androvsky
for
the
moment
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
worshippers
from
the
shadowy
interior
came
forth
a
ceaseless
sound
of
prayer
to
join
the
prayer
without
there
was
a
narrow
stone
seat
by
the
mosque
door
and
she
sat
down
upon
it
she
felt
suddenly
weary
as
one
being
hypnotised
feels
weary
when
the
body
and
spirit
begin
to
yield
to
the
spell
of
the
operator
androvsky
remained
standing
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
and
she
thought
his
face
looked
almost
as
if
the
blood
had
sunk
away
from
it
leaving
it
white
beneath
the
brown
tint
set
there
by
the
sun
he
stayed
quite
still
the
dark
shadow
cast
by
the
towering
mosque
fell
upon
him
and
his
immobile
figure
suggested
to
her
ranges
of
infinite
melancholy
she
sighed
as
one
oppressed
there
was
an
old
man
praying
near
them
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
interior
he
was
very
thin
almost
a
skeleton
was
dressed
in
rags
through
which
his
body
sharp
with
bones
could
be
seen
and
had
a
scanty
white
beard
sticking
up
like
a
brush
at
the
tip
of
his
pointed
chin
his
face
worn
with
hardship
and
turned
to
the
likeness
of
parchment
by
time
and
the
action
of
the
sun
was
full
of
senile
venom
and
his
toothless
mouth
with
its
lips
folded
inwards
moved
perpetually
as
if
he
were
trying
to
bite
with
rhythmical
regularity
like
one
obeying
a
conductor
he
shot
forth
his
arms
towards
the
mosque
as
if
he
wished
to
strike
it
withdrew
them
paused
then
shot
them
forth
again
and
as
his
arms
shot
forth
he
uttered
a
prolonged
and
trembling
shriek
full
of
weak
yet
intense
fury
he
was
surely
crying
out
upon
god
denouncing
god
for
the
evils
that
had
beset
his
nearly
ended
life
poor
horrible
old
man
androvsky
was
closer
to
him
than
she
was
but
did
not
seem
to
notice
him
once
she
had
seen
him
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
him
his
perpetual
gesture
his
perpetual
shriek
became
abominable
to
her
in
the
midst
of
the
bowing
bodies
and
the
humming
voices
of
prayer
each
time
he
struck
at
the
mosque
and
uttered
his
piercing
cry
she
seemed
to
hear
an
oath
spoken
in
a
sanctuary
she
longed
to
stop
him
this
one
blasphemer
began
to
destroy
for
her
the
mystic
atmosphere
created
by
the
multitudes
of
adorers
and
at
last
she
could
no
longer
endure
his
reiterated
enmity
she
touched
androvsky
s
arm
he
started
and
looked
at
her
that
old
man
she
whispered
can
t
you
speak
to
him
androvsky
glanced
at
him
for
the
first
time
speak
to
him
madame
why
he
he
s
horrible
she
felt
a
sudden
disinclination
to
tell
androvsky
why
the
old
man
was
horrible
to
her
what
do
you
wish
me
to
say
to
him
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
be
able
to
stop
him
from
doing
androvsky
bent
down
and
spoke
to
the
old
man
in
arabic
he
shot
out
his
arms
and
reiterated
his
trembling
shriek
it
pierced
the
sound
of
prayer
as
lightning
pierces
cloud
domini
got
up
quickly
i
can
t
bear
it
she
said
still
in
a
whisper
it
s
as
if
he
were
cursing
androvsky
looked
at
the
old
man
again
this
time
with
profound
attention
isn
t
it
she
said
isn
t
it
as
if
he
were
cursing
god
while
the
whole
world
worshipped
and
that
one
cry
of
hatred
seems
louder
than
the
praises
of
the
whole
we
can
t
stop
something
in
his
voice
made
her
say
abruptly
do
you
wish
to
stop
it
he
did
not
answer
the
old
man
struck
at
the
mosque
and
shrieked
domini
shuddered
i
can
t
stay
here
she
said
at
this
moment
mustapha
appeared
followed
by
the
guardian
of
the
mosque
who
carried
two
pairs
of
tattered
slippers
monsieur
and
madame
must
take
off
their
boots
then
i
will
show
the
domini
put
on
the
slippers
hastily
and
went
into
the
mosque
without
waiting
to
see
whether
androvsky
was
following
and
the
old
man
s
furious
cry
pursued
her
through
the
doorway
within
there
was
space
and
darkness
the
darkness
seemed
to
be
praying
vistas
of
arches
stretched
away
in
front
to
right
and
left
on
the
floor
covered
with
matting
quantities
of
shrouded
figures
knelt
and
swayed
stood
up
suddenly
knelt
again
bowed
down
their
foreheads
preceded
by
mustapha
and
the
guide
who
walked
on
their
stockinged
feet
domini
slowly
threaded
her
way
among
them
following
a
winding
path
whose
borders
were
praying
men
to
prevent
her
slippers
from
falling
off
she
had
to
shuffle
along
without
lifting
her
feet
from
the
ground
with
the
regularity
of
a
beating
pulse
the
old
man
s
shriek
fainter
now
came
to
her
from
without
but
presently
as
she
penetrated
farther
into
the
mosque
it
was
swallowed
up
by
the
sound
of
prayer
no
one
seemed
to
see
her
or
to
know
that
she
was
there
she
brushed
against
the
white
garments
of
worshippers
and
when
she
did
so
she
felt
as
if
she
touched
the
hem
of
the
garments
of
mystery
and
she
held
her
habit
together
with
her
hands
lest
she
should
recall
even
one
of
these
hearts
that
were
surely
very
far
off
mustapha
and
the
guardian
stood
still
and
looked
round
at
domini
their
faces
were
solemn
the
expression
of
greedy
anxiety
had
gone
out
of
mustapha
s
eyes
for
the
moment
the
thought
of
money
had
been
driven
out
of
his
mind
by
some
graver
she
saw
in
the
two
wooden
doors
set
between
pillars
they
were
painted
green
and
red
and
fastened
with
clamps
and
bolts
of
hammered
copper
that
looked
enormously
old
against
them
were
nailed
two
pictures
of
winged
horses
with
human
heads
and
two
more
pictures
representing
a
fantastical
town
of
eastern
houses
and
minarets
in
gold
on
a
red
background
balls
of
purple
and
yellow
glass
and
crystal
chandeliers
hung
from
the
high
ceiling
above
these
doors
with
many
ancient
lamps
and
two
tattered
and
dusty
banners
of
pale
pink
and
white
silk
fringed
with
gold
and
powdered
with
a
gold
pattern
of
flowers
were
tied
to
the
pillars
with
thin
cords
of
camel
s
hair
this
is
the
tomb
of
whispered
mustapha
it
is
opened
once
a
the
guardian
of
the
mosque
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
tomb
that
is
mustapha
pointed
to
the
pictures
of
the
city
then
he
too
dropped
down
and
pressed
his
forehead
against
the
matting
domini
glanced
round
for
androvsky
he
was
not
there
she
stood
alone
before
the
tomb
of
zerzour
the
only
human
being
in
the
great
dim
building
who
was
not
worshipping
and
she
felt
a
terrible
isolation
as
if
she
were
excommunicated
as
if
she
dared
not
pray
for
a
moment
almost
as
if
the
god
to
whom
this
torrent
of
worship
flowed
were
hostile
to
her
alone
had
her
father
ever
felt
such
a
sensation
of
unutterable
solitude
it
passed
quickly
and
standing
under
the
votive
lamps
before
the
painted
doors
she
prayed
too
silently
she
shut
her
eyes
and
imagined
a
church
of
her
religion
the
little
church
of
she
tried
to
imagine
the
voice
of
prayer
all
about
her
the
voice
of
the
great
catholic
church
but
that
was
not
possible
even
when
she
saw
nothing
and
turned
her
soul
inward
upon
itself
and
strove
to
set
this
new
world
into
which
she
had
come
far
off
she
heard
in
the
long
murmur
that
filled
it
a
sound
that
surely
rose
from
the
sand
from
the
heart
and
the
spirit
of
the
sand
from
the
heart
and
the
spirit
of
desert
places
and
that
went
up
in
the
darkness
of
the
mosque
and
floated
under
the
arches
through
the
doorway
above
the
palms
and
the
houses
and
that
winged
its
fierce
way
like
a
desert
eagle
towards
the
sun
mustapha
s
hand
was
on
her
arm
the
guardian
too
had
risen
from
his
knees
and
drawn
from
his
robe
and
lit
a
candle
she
came
to
a
tiny
doorway
passed
through
it
and
began
to
mount
a
winding
stair
the
sound
of
prayer
mounted
with
her
from
the
mosque
and
when
she
came
out
upon
the
platform
enclosed
in
the
summit
of
the
minaret
she
heard
it
still
and
it
was
multiplied
for
all
the
voices
from
the
outside
courts
joined
it
and
many
voices
from
the
roofs
of
the
houses
round
about
men
were
praying
there
too
praying
in
the
glare
of
the
sun
upon
their
housetops
she
saw
them
from
the
minaret
and
she
saw
the
town
that
had
sprung
up
round
the
tomb
of
the
saint
and
all
the
palms
of
the
oasis
and
beyond
them
immeasurable
spaces
of
desert
she
was
above
the
eternal
cry
now
she
had
mounted
like
a
prayer
towards
the
sun
like
a
living
pulsing
prayer
like
the
soul
of
prayer
she
gazed
at
the
desert
and
saw
prayer
travelling
the
soul
of
prayer
travelling
whither
where
was
the
end
where
was
the
with
at
last
the
pitched
tent
the
camp
fires
and
the
long
the
long
repose
when
she
came
down
and
reached
the
court
she
found
the
old
man
still
striking
at
the
mosque
and
shrieking
out
his
trembling
imprecation
and
she
found
androvsky
still
standing
by
him
with
fascinated
eyes
she
had
mounted
with
the
voice
of
prayer
into
the
sunshine
surely
a
little
way
towards
god
androvsky
had
remained
in
the
dark
shadow
with
a
curse
it
was
foolish
perhaps
a
woman
s
vagrant
fancy
but
she
wished
he
had
mounted
with
her
book

the
garden
chapter
x
it
was
noon
in
the
desert
the
voice
of
the
mueddin
died
away
on
the
minaret
and
the
golden
silence
that
comes
out
of
the
heart
of
the
sun
sank
down
once
more
softly
over
everything
nature
seemed
unnaturally
still
in
the
heat
the
slight
winds
were
not
at
play
and
the
palms
of
stood
motionless
as
palm
trees
in
a
dream
the
day
was
like
a
dream
intense
and
passionate
yet
touched
with
something
unearthly
something
almost
spiritual
in
the
cloudless
blue
of
the
sky
there
seemed
a
magical
depth
regions
of
colour
infinitely
prolonged
in
the
vision
of
the
distances
where
desert
blent
with
sky
earth
surely
curving
up
to
meet
the
downward
curving
heaven
the
dimness
was
like
a
voice
whispering
strange
petitions
the
ranges
of
mountains
slept
in
the
burning
sand
and
the
light
slept
in
their
clefts
like
the
languid
in
cool
places
for
there
was
a
glorious
languor
even
in
the
light
as
if
the
sun
were
faintly
oppressed
by
the
marvel
of
his
power
the
clearness
of
the
atmosphere
in
the
remote
desert
was
not
obscured
but
was
impregnated
with
the
mystery
that
is
the
wonder
child
of
shadows
the
gold
that
kept
it
seemed
to
contain
a
secret
darkness
in
the
oasis
of
men
who
had
slowly
roused
themselves
to
pray
sank
down
to
sleep
again
in
the
warm
twilight
of
shrouded
gardens
or
the
warm
night
of
windowless
rooms
in
the
garden
of
count
anteoni
larbi
s
flute
was
silent
it
is
like
noon
in
a
mirage
domini
said
softly
count
anteoni
nodded
i
feel
as
if
i
were
looking
at
myself
a
long
way
off
she
added
as
if
i
saw
myself
as
i
saw
the
grey
sea
and
the
islands
on
the
way
to
what
magic
there
is
here
and
i
can
t
get
accustomed
to
it
each
day
i
wonder
at
it
more
and
find
it
more
inexplicable
it
almost
frightens
you
could
be
frightened
not
easily
by
outside
things
it
least
i
hope
but
what
then
i
scarcely
know
sometimes
i
think
all
the
outside
things
which
do
what
are
called
the
violent
deeds
in
life
are
tame
and
timid
and
ridiculously
impotent
in
comparison
with
the
things
we
can
t
see
which
do
the
deeds
we
can
t
in
the
mirage
of
this
land
you
begin
to
see
the
exterior
life
as
a
mirage
you
are
learning
you
are
there
was
a
creeping
sound
of
something
that
was
almost
impish
in
his
voice
are
you
a
secret
agent
domini
asked
him
of
whom
madame
she
was
silent
she
seemed
to
be
considering
he
watched
her
with
curiosity
in
his
bright
eyes
of
the
desert
she
answered
at
length
quite
seriously
a
secret
agent
has
always
a
definite
object
what
is
mine
how
can
i
know
how
can
i
tell
what
the
desert
desires
already
you
personify
it
the
network
of
wrinkles
showed
itself
in
his
brown
face
as
he
smiled
surely
with
triumph
i
think
i
did
that
from
the
first
she
answered
gravely
i
know
i
and
what
sort
of
personage
does
the
desert
seem
to
you
you
ask
me
a
great
many
questions
mirage
questions
perhaps
forgive
me
let
us
listen
to
the
question
or
is
it
the
demand
of
the
desert
in
this
noontide
hour
the
greatest
hour
of
all
the
in
such
a
land
as
they
were
silent
again
watching
the
noon
listening
to
it
feeling
it
as
they
had
been
silent
when
the
mueddin
s
nasal
voice
rose
in
the
call
to
prayer
count
anteoni
stood
in
the
sunshine
by
the
low
white
parapet
of
the
garden
domini
sat
on
a
low
chair
in
the
shadow
cast
by
a
great
jamelon
tree
at
her
feet
was
a
bush
of
vivid
scarlet
geraniums
against
which
her
white
linen
dress
looked
curiously
blanched
there
was
a
yet
imaginative
light
in
her
gipsy
eyes
and
her
motionless
figure
her
quiet
hands
covered
with
white
gloves
lying
loosely
in
her
lap
looked
attentive
and
yet
languid
as
if
some
spell
began
to
bind
her
but
had
not
completed
its
work
of
stilling
all
the
pulses
of
life
that
throbbed
within
her
and
in
truth
there
was
a
spell
upon
her
the
spell
of
the
golden
noon
by
turns
she
gave
herself
to
it
consciously
then
consciously
strove
to
deny
herself
to
its
subtle
summons
and
each
time
she
tried
to
withdraw
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
spell
was
a
little
stronger
her
power
a
little
weaker
then
her
lips
curved
in
a
smile
that
was
neither
joyous
nor
sad
that
was
perhaps
rather
part
perplexed
and
part
expectant
after
a
minute
of
this
silence
count
anteoni
drew
back
from
the
sun
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
beside
domini
he
took
out
his
watch
minutes
he
said
and
my
guests
will
be
guests
she
said
with
an
accent
of
surprise
i
invited
the
priest
to
make
an
even
oh
you
don
t
dislike
him
i
like
him
i
respect
but
i
m
afraid
you
aren
t
pleased
domini
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
why
did
you
invite
father
roubier
she
said
isn
t
four
better
than
three
you
don
t
want
to
tell
i
am
a
little
malicious
you
have
divined
it
so
why
should
i
not
acknowledge
it
i
asked
father
roubier
because
i
wished
to
see
the
man
of
prayer
with
the
man
who
fled
from
mussulman
prayer
she
said
quickly
prayer
he
said
his
voice
was
peculiarly
harsh
at
that
moment
it
grated
like
an
instrument
on
a
rough
surface
domini
knew
that
secretly
he
was
standing
up
for
the
arab
faith
that
her
last
words
had
seemed
to
strike
against
the
religion
of
the
people
whom
he
loved
with
an
odd
concealed
passion
whose
fire
she
began
to
feel
at
moments
as
she
grew
to
know
him
better
it
was
plain
from
their
manner
to
each
other
that
their
former
slight
acquaintance
had
moved
towards
something
like
a
pleasant
friendship
domini
looked
as
if
she
were
no
longer
a
in
this
marvellous
garden
of
the
sun
but
as
if
she
had
become
familiar
with
it
yet
her
wonder
was
not
gone
it
was
only
different
there
was
less
sheer
amazement
more
affection
in
it
as
she
had
said
she
had
not
become
accustomed
to
the
magic
of
africa
its
strangeness
its
contrasts
still
startled
and
moved
her
but
she
began
to
feel
as
if
she
belonged
to
as
if
would
perhaps
miss
her
a
little
if
she
went
away
ten
days
had
passed
since
the
ride
to
days
rather
like
a
dream
to
domini
what
she
had
sought
in
coming
to
she
was
surely
finding
her
act
was
bringing
forth
its
fruit
she
had
put
a
gulf
in
which
rolled
the
sea
between
the
land
of
the
old
life
and
the
land
in
which
at
least
the
new
life
was
to
begin
the
completeness
of
the
severance
had
acted
upon
her
like
a
blow
that
does
not
stun
but
wakens
the
days
went
like
a
dream
but
in
the
dream
there
was
the
stir
of
birth
her
lassitude
was
permanently
gone
there
had
been
no
returning
after
the
first
hours
of
excitement
the
frost
that
had
numbed
her
senses
had
utterly
melted
away
who
could
be
in
this
land
of
fire
she
had
longed
for
peace
and
she
was
surely
finding
it
but
it
was
a
peace
without
stagnation
hope
dwelt
in
it
and
expectancy
vague
but
persistent
as
to
forgetfulness
sometimes
she
woke
from
the
dream
and
was
almost
dazed
almost
ashamed
to
think
how
much
she
was
forgetting
and
how
quickly
her
european
life
and
friends
some
of
them
intimate
and
close
were
like
a
cloud
on
the
horizon
flying
still
farther
before
a
steady
wind
that
set
from
her
to
it
soon
it
would
disappear
would
be
as
if
it
had
never
been
now
and
then
with
a
sort
of
fierce
obstinacy
she
tried
to
stay
the
flight
she
had
desired
and
desired
still
she
said
to
herself
i
will
remember
it
s
contemptible
to
forget
like
this
it
s
weak
to
be
able
then
she
looked
at
the
mountains
or
the
desert
at
two
arabs
playing
the
ladies
game
under
the
shadow
of
a
cafe
wall
or
at
a
girl
in
dusty
orange
filling
a
goatskin
pitcher
at
a
well
beneath
a
palm
tree
and
she
succumbed
to
the
lulling
influence
smiling
as
they
smile
who
hear
the
gentle
ripple
of
the
waters
of
lethe
she
heard
them
perhaps
most
clearly
when
she
wandered
in
count
anteoni
s
garden
he
had
made
her
free
of
it
in
their
first
interview
she
had
ventured
to
take
him
at
his
word
knowing
that
if
he
repented
she
would
divine
it
he
had
made
her
feel
that
he
had
not
repented
sometimes
she
did
not
see
him
as
she
threaded
the
sandy
alleys
between
the
little
rills
hearing
the
distant
song
of
larbi
s
amorous
flute
or
sat
in
the
dense
shade
of
the
trees
watching
through
a
of
quivering
golden
leaves
the
passing
of
the
caravans
along
the
desert
tracks
sometimes
a
little
wreath
of
ascending
smoke
curling
above
the
purple
petals
of
bougainvilleas
or
the
red
cloud
of
oleanders
told
her
of
his
presence
in
some
retired
oftener
he
joined
her
with
an
easy
politeness
that
did
not
conceal
his
oddity
but
clothed
it
in
a
pleasant
garment
and
they
talked
for
a
while
or
stayed
for
a
while
in
an
agreeable
silence
that
each
felt
to
be
sympathetic
domini
thought
of
him
as
a
new
species
of
man
a
hermit
of
the
world
he
knew
the
world
and
did
not
hate
it
his
satire
was
rarely
quite
ungentle
he
did
not
strike
her
as
a
disappointed
man
who
fled
to
solitude
in
bitterness
of
spirit
but
rather
as
an
imaginative
man
with
an
unusual
feeling
for
romance
and
perhaps
a
desire
for
freedom
that
the
normal
civilised
life
restrained
too
much
he
loved
thought
as
many
love
conversation
silence
as
some
love
music
now
and
then
he
said
a
sad
or
bitter
thing
sometimes
she
seemed
to
be
near
to
something
stern
sometimes
she
felt
as
if
there
were
a
secret
link
which
connected
him
with
the
in
his
little
darkened
chamber
with
the
legions
who
prayed
about
the
tomb
of
but
these
moments
were
rare
as
a
rule
he
was
whimsical
and
kind
with
the
kindness
of
a
man
who
was
human
even
in
his
detachment
from
ordinary
humanity
his
humour
was
a
salt
with
plenty
of
savour
his
imagination
was
of
a
sort
which
interested
and
even
charmed
her
she
felt
too
that
she
interested
him
and
that
he
was
a
man
not
readily
interested
in
ordinary
human
beings
he
had
seen
too
many
and
judged
too
shrewdly
and
too
swiftly
to
be
easily
held
for
very
long
she
had
no
ambition
to
hold
him
and
had
never
in
her
life
consciously
striven
to
attract
or
retain
any
man
but
she
was
woman
enough
to
find
his
obvious
pleasure
in
her
society
agreeable
she
thought
that
her
genuine
adoration
of
the
garden
he
had
made
of
the
land
in
which
it
was
set
had
not
a
little
to
do
with
the
happy
nature
of
their
intercourse
for
she
felt
certain
that
beneath
the
light
satire
of
his
manner
his
often
smiling
airs
of
detachment
and
quiet
independence
there
was
something
that
could
seek
almost
with
passion
that
could
cling
with
resolution
that
could
even
love
with
persistence
and
she
fancied
that
he
sought
in
the
desert
that
he
clung
to
its
mystery
that
he
loved
it
and
the
garden
he
had
created
in
it
once
she
had
laughingly
called
him
a
desert
spirit
he
had
smiled
as
if
with
contentment
they
knew
little
of
each
other
yet
they
had
become
friends
in
the
garden
which
he
never
left
one
day
she
said
to
him
you
love
the
desert
why
do
you
never
go
into
it
i
prefer
to
watch
it
he
relied
when
you
are
in
the
desert
it
bewilders
she
remembered
what
she
had
felt
during
her
first
ride
with
androvsky
i
believe
you
are
afraid
of
it
she
said
challengingly
fear
is
sometimes
the
beginning
of
wisdom
he
answered
but
you
are
without
it
i
how
do
you
know
every
day
i
see
you
galloping
away
into
the
she
thought
there
was
a
faint
sound
of
warning
or
was
it
of
rebuke
in
his
voice
it
made
her
feel
defiant
i
think
you
lose
a
great
deal
by
not
galloping
into
the
sun
too
she
said
but
if
i
don
t
ride
that
made
her
think
of
androvsky
and
his
angry
resolution
it
had
not
been
the
resolution
of
a
day
wearied
and
stiffened
as
he
had
been
by
the
expedition
to
actually
injured
by
his
fall
she
knew
from
batouch
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
call
in
the
doctor
to
bandage
his
shoulder
she
had
been
roused
at
dawn
on
the
day
following
by
his
tread
on
the
verandah
she
had
lain
still
while
it
descended
the
staircase
but
then
the
sharp
neighing
of
a
horse
had
awakened
an
irresistible
curiosity
in
her
she
had
got
up
wrapped
herself
in
a
fur
coat
and
slipped
out
on
to
the
verandah
the
sun
was
not
above
the
horizon
line
of
the
desert
but
the
darkness
of
night
was
melting
into
a
luminous
grey
the
air
was
almost
cold
the
palms
looked
spectral
even
terrible
the
empty
and
silent
gardens
melancholy
and
dangerous
it
was
not
an
hour
for
activity
for
determination
but
for
reverie
for
apprehension
below
a
sleepy
arab
boy
his
hood
drawn
over
his
head
held
the
chestnut
horse
by
the
bridle
androvsky
came
out
from
the
arcade
he
wore
a
cap
pulled
down
to
his
eyebrows
which
changed
his
appearance
giving
him
as
seen
from
above
the
look
of
a
groom
or
stable
hand
he
stood
for
a
minute
and
stared
at
the
horse
then
he
limped
round
to
the
left
side
and
carefully
mounted
following
out
the
directions
domini
had
given
him
the
previous
day
to
avoid
touching
the
animal
with
his
foot
to
have
the
rein
in
his
fingers
before
leaving
the
ground
and
to
come
down
in
the
saddle
as
lightly
as
possible
she
noted
that
all
her
hints
were
taken
with
infinite
precaution
once
on
the
horse
he
tried
to
sit
up
straight
but
found
the
effort
too
great
in
his
weary
and
bruised
condition
he
leaned
forward
over
the
saddle
peak
and
rode
away
in
the
luminous
greyness
towards
the
desert
the
horse
went
quietly
as
if
affected
by
the
mystery
of
the
still
hour
horse
and
rider
disappeared
the
arab
boy
wandered
off
in
the
direction
of
the
village
but
domini
remained
looking
after
androvsky
she
saw
nothing
but
the
grim
palms
and
the
spectral
atmosphere
in
which
the
desert
lay
yet
she
did
not
move
till
a
red
spear
was
thrust
up
out
of
the
east
towards
the
last
waning
star
he
had
gone
to
learn
his
lesson
in
the
desert
three
days
afterwards
she
rode
with
him
again
she
did
not
let
him
know
of
her
presence
on
the
verandah
and
he
said
nothing
of
his
departure
in
the
dawn
he
spoke
very
little
and
seemed
much
occupied
with
his
horse
and
she
saw
that
he
was
more
than
determined
that
he
was
apt
at
acquiring
control
of
a
physical
exercise
new
to
him
his
great
strength
stood
him
in
good
stead
only
a
man
hard
in
the
body
could
have
so
rapidly
recovered
from
the
effects
of
that
first
day
of
defeat
and
struggle
his
absolute
reticence
about
his
efforts
and
the
iron
will
that
prompted
them
pleased
domini
she
found
them
worthy
of
a
man
she
rode
with
him
on
three
occasions
twice
in
the
oasis
through
the
brown
villages
once
out
into
the
desert
on
the
caravan
road
that
batouch
had
told
her
led
at
last
to
tombouctou
they
did
not
travel
far
along
it
but
domini
knew
at
once
that
this
route
held
more
fascination
for
her
than
the
route
to
there
was
far
more
sand
in
this
region
of
the
desert
the
little
humps
crowned
with
the
scrub
the
camels
feed
on
were
fewer
so
that
the
flatness
of
the
ground
was
more
definite
here
and
there
large
dunes
of
sand
rose
some
straight
as
city
walls
some
curved
like
seats
in
an
amphitheatre
others
indented
crenellated
like
battlements
undulating
in
beastlike
shapes
the
distant
panorama
of
desert
was
unbroken
by
any
visible
oasis
and
powerfully
suggested
eternity
to
domini
when
i
go
out
into
the
desert
for
my
long
journey
i
shall
go
by
this
road
she
said
to
androvsky
you
are
going
on
a
journey
he
said
looking
at
her
as
if
startled
some
all
alone
i
suppose
i
must
take
a
caravan
two
or
three
arabs
some
horses
a
tent
or
two
it
s
easy
to
manage
batouch
will
arrange
it
for
androvsky
still
looked
startled
and
half
angry
she
thought
they
had
pulled
up
their
horses
among
the
sand
dunes
it
was
near
sunset
and
the
breath
of
evening
was
in
the
sir
making
its
coolness
even
more
ethereal
more
thinly
pure
than
in
the
daytime
the
atmosphere
was
so
clear
that
when
they
glanced
back
they
could
see
the
flag
fluttering
upon
the
white
of
the
great
hotel
of
many
kilometres
away
among
the
palms
so
still
that
they
could
hear
the
bark
of
a
kabyle
off
near
a
nomad
s
tent
pitched
in
the
green
land
by
the
of
old
when
they
looked
in
front
of
them
they
seemed
to
see
thousands
of
leagues
of
flatness
stretching
on
and
on
till
the
pale
yellowish
brown
of
it
grew
darker
merged
into
a
strange
blueness
like
the
blue
of
a
hot
mist
above
a
southern
lake
then
into
violet
then
into
the
thing
they
could
not
see
the
summoning
thing
whose
voice
domini
s
imagination
heard
like
a
remote
and
thrilling
echo
whenever
she
was
in
the
desert
i
did
not
know
you
were
going
on
a
journey
madame
androvsky
said
don
t
you
remember
she
rejoined
laughingly
that
i
told
you
on
the
tower
i
thought
peace
must
dwell
out
there
well
some
day
i
shall
set
out
to
find
that
seems
a
long
time
ago
madame
he
muttered
sometimes
when
speaking
to
her
he
dropped
his
voice
till
she
could
scarcely
hear
him
and
sounded
like
a
man
communing
with
himself
a
red
light
from
the
sinking
sun
fell
upon
the
dunes
as
they
rode
back
over
them
their
horses
seemed
to
be
wading
through
a
silent
sea
of
blood
the
sky
in
the
west
looked
like
an
enormous
conflagration
in
which
tortured
things
were
struggling
and
lifting
twisted
arms
domini
s
acquaintance
with
androvsky
had
not
progressed
as
easily
and
pleasantly
as
her
intercourse
with
count
anteoni
she
recognised
that
he
was
what
is
called
a
difficult
now
and
then
as
if
under
the
prompting
influence
of
some
secret
and
violent
emotion
he
spoke
with
apparent
naturalness
spoke
perhaps
out
of
his
heart
each
time
he
did
so
she
noticed
that
there
was
something
of
either
doubt
or
amazement
in
what
he
said
she
gathered
that
he
was
slow
to
rely
quick
to
mistrust
she
gathered
too
that
very
many
things
surprised
him
and
felt
sure
that
he
hid
nearly
all
of
them
from
her
and
would
had
not
his
own
will
sometimes
betrayed
him
have
hidden
all
his
reserve
was
as
intense
as
everything
about
him
there
was
a
fierceness
in
it
that
revealed
its
existence
he
always
conveyed
to
her
a
feeling
of
strength
physical
and
mental
yet
he
always
conveyed
too
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
to
a
woman
of
domini
s
temperament
uneasiness
usually
implies
a
public
or
secret
weakness
in
androvsky
s
she
seemed
to
be
aware
of
passion
as
if
it
were
one
to
dash
obstacles
aside
to
break
through
doors
of
iron
to
rush
out
into
the
open
and
then
what
then
to
tremble
at
the
world
before
him
at
what
he
had
done
she
did
not
know
but
she
did
know
that
even
in
his
uneasiness
there
seemed
to
be
fibre
muscle
sinew
nerve
all
which
goes
to
make
strength
swiftness
speech
was
singularly
difficult
to
him
silence
seemed
to
be
natural
not
irksome
after
a
few
words
he
fell
into
it
and
remained
in
it
and
he
was
less
in
silence
than
in
speech
he
seemed
she
fancied
to
feel
himself
safer
more
a
man
when
he
was
not
speaking
to
him
the
use
of
words
was
surely
like
a
yielding
he
had
a
peculiar
faculty
of
making
his
presence
felt
when
he
was
silent
as
if
directly
he
ceased
from
speaking
the
flame
in
him
was
fanned
and
leaped
up
at
the
outside
world
beyond
its
bars
she
did
not
know
whether
he
was
a
gentleman
or
not
if
anyone
had
asked
her
before
she
came
to
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
her
to
take
four
solitary
rides
with
a
man
to
meet
him
if
only
for
a
few
minutes
every
day
of
ten
days
to
sit
opposite
to
him
and
not
far
from
him
at
meals
during
the
same
space
of
time
and
to
be
unable
to
say
to
herself
whether
he
was
or
was
not
a
gentleman
by
birth
and
education
feeling
set
aside
she
would
have
answered
without
hesitation
that
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
yet
so
it
was
she
could
not
decide
she
could
not
place
him
she
could
not
imagine
what
his
parentage
what
his
youth
his
manhood
had
been
she
could
not
fancy
him
in
any
environment
save
that
golden
light
that
blue
radiance
in
which
she
had
first
consciously
and
fully
met
him
face
to
face
she
could
not
hear
him
in
converse
with
any
set
of
men
or
women
or
invent
in
her
mind
what
he
might
be
likely
to
say
to
them
she
could
not
conceive
him
bound
by
any
ties
of
home
or
family
mother
sister
wife
child
when
she
looked
at
him
thought
about
him
he
presented
himself
to
her
alone
like
a
thing
in
the
air
yet
he
was
more
male
than
other
men
breathed
humanity
of
some
kind
as
fire
breathes
heat
the
child
there
was
in
him
almost
confused
her
made
her
wonder
whether
long
contact
with
the
world
had
tarnished
her
own
original
simplicity
but
she
only
saw
the
child
in
him
now
and
then
and
she
fancied
that
it
too
he
was
anxious
to
conceal
this
man
had
certainly
a
power
to
rouse
feeling
in
others
she
knew
it
by
her
own
experience
by
turns
he
had
made
her
feel
motherly
protecting
curious
constrained
passionate
energetic
timid
yes
almost
timid
and
shy
no
other
human
being
had
ever
even
at
moments
thus
got
the
better
of
her
natural
audacity
lack
of
and
inherent
almost
boyish
boldness
nor
was
she
aware
what
it
was
in
him
which
sometimes
made
her
uncertain
of
herself
she
wondered
but
he
often
woke
up
wonder
in
her
despite
their
rides
their
moments
of
intercourse
in
the
hotel
on
the
verandah
she
scarcely
felt
more
intimate
with
him
than
she
had
at
first
sometimes
indeed
she
thought
that
she
felt
less
so
that
the
moment
when
the
train
ran
out
of
the
tunnel
into
the
blue
country
was
the
moment
in
which
they
had
been
nearest
to
each
other
since
they
trod
the
verges
of
each
other
s
lives
she
had
never
definitely
said
to
herself
do
i
like
him
or
dislike
him
now
as
she
sat
with
count
anteoni
watching
the
noon
the
expression
had
gone
out
of
her
face
she
looked
rather
rigid
rather
formidable
androvsky
and
count
anteoni
had
never
met
the
count
had
seen
androvsky
in
the
distance
from
his
garden
more
than
once
but
androvsky
had
not
seen
him
the
meeting
that
was
about
to
take
place
was
due
to
domini
she
had
spoken
to
androvsky
on
several
occasions
of
the
romantic
beauty
of
this
desert
garden
it
is
like
a
garden
of
the
she
had
said
he
did
not
look
enlightened
and
she
was
moved
to
ask
him
abruptly
whether
he
had
ever
read
the
famous
book
he
had
not
a
doubt
came
to
her
whether
he
had
ever
even
heard
of
it
she
mentioned
the
fact
of
count
anteoni
s
having
made
the
garden
and
spoke
of
him
sketching
lightly
his
whimsicality
his
affection
for
the
arabs
his
love
of
solitude
and
of
african
life
she
also
mentioned
that
he
was
by
birth
a
roman
but
scarcely
of
the
black
world
i
should
imagine
she
added
androvsky
said
nothing
you
should
go
and
see
the
garden
she
continued
count
anteoni
allows
visitors
to
explore
i
am
sure
it
must
be
very
beautiful
madame
he
replied
rather
coldly
she
thought
he
did
not
say
that
he
would
go
as
the
garden
won
upon
her
as
its
enchanted
mystery
the
airy
wonder
of
its
shadowy
places
the
glory
of
its
trembling
golden
vistas
the
restfulness
of
its
green
defiles
the
strange
almost
unearthly
peace
that
reigned
within
it
embalmed
her
spirit
as
she
learned
not
only
to
marvel
at
it
to
be
entranced
by
it
but
to
feel
at
home
in
it
and
love
it
she
was
conscious
of
a
persistent
desire
that
androvsky
should
know
it
too
perhaps
his
dogged
determination
about
the
riding
had
touched
her
more
than
she
was
aware
she
often
saw
before
her
the
bent
figure
that
looked
tired
riding
alone
into
the
luminous
grey
starting
thus
early
that
his
act
humble
and
determined
might
not
be
known
by
her
he
did
not
know
that
she
had
seen
him
not
only
on
that
morning
but
on
many
subsequent
mornings
setting
forth
to
study
the
new
art
in
the
solitude
of
the
still
hours
but
the
fact
that
she
had
seen
had
watched
till
horse
and
rider
vanished
beyond
the
palms
had
understood
why
perhaps
moved
her
to
this
permanent
wish
that
he
could
share
her
pleasure
in
the
garden
know
it
as
she
did
she
did
not
argue
with
herself
about
the
matter
she
only
knew
that
she
wished
that
presently
she
meant
androvsky
to
pass
through
the
white
gate
and
be
met
on
the
sand
by
smain
with
his
rose
one
day
count
anteoni
had
asked
her
whether
she
had
made
acquaintance
with
the
man
who
had
fled
from
prayer
yes
she
said
you
know
how
we
have
ridden
to
i
am
not
always
by
the
no
but
i
think
you
were
that
why
do
you
think
so
i
am
sure
you
he
did
not
either
acknowledge
or
deny
it
he
has
never
been
to
see
my
garden
he
said
he
ought
to
i
have
told
him
ah
is
he
coming
i
don
t
think
persuade
him
to
i
have
a
pride
in
my
garden
oh
you
have
no
idea
what
a
pride
any
neglect
of
it
any
indifference
about
it
rasps
me
plays
upon
the
raw
nerve
each
one
of
us
he
spoke
smilingly
she
did
not
know
what
he
was
feeling
whether
the
remote
thinker
or
the
imp
within
him
was
at
work
or
play
i
doubt
if
he
is
a
man
to
be
easily
persuaded
she
said
perhaps
not
persuade
after
a
moment
domini
said
i
wonder
whether
you
recognise
that
there
are
obstacles
which
the
human
will
can
t
negotiate
i
could
scarcely
live
where
i
do
without
recognising
that
the
grains
of
sand
are
often
driven
by
the
wind
but
when
there
is
no
wind
they
lie
still
and
are
the
desert
i
want
to
have
a
strange
what
a
in
my
a
fantasia
something
far
more
banal
a
lunch
party
a
will
you
honour
me
by
breakfasting
with
you
yes
of
course
thank
and
will
you
bring
the
second
sun
worshipper
she
looked
into
the
count
s
small
shining
eyes
monsieur
androvsky
if
that
is
his
name
i
can
send
him
an
invitation
of
course
but
that
s
rather
formal
and
i
don
t
think
he
is
on
what
day
do
you
ask
us
any
day
and
why
do
you
ask
us
i
wish
to
overcome
this
indifference
to
my
garden
it
hurts
me
not
only
in
my
pride
but
in
my
the
whole
thing
had
been
like
a
sort
of
serious
game
domini
had
not
said
that
she
would
convey
the
odd
invitation
but
when
she
was
alone
and
thought
of
the
way
in
which
count
anteoni
had
said
persuade
him
she
knew
she
would
and
she
meant
androvsky
to
accept
it
this
was
an
opportunity
of
seeing
him
in
company
with
another
man
a
man
of
the
world
who
had
read
travelled
thought
and
doubtless
lived
she
asked
him
that
evening
and
saw
the
red
that
came
as
it
comes
in
a
boy
s
face
mount
to
his
forehead
everybody
who
comes
to
comes
to
see
the
garden
she
said
before
he
could
reply
count
anteoni
is
half
angry
with
you
for
being
an
but
but
madame
how
can
monsieur
the
count
know
that
i
am
here
i
have
not
seen
he
knows
there
is
a
second
traveller
and
he
s
a
hospitable
man
monsieur
androvsky
i
want
you
to
come
i
want
you
to
see
the
it
is
very
kind
of
you
the
reluctance
in
his
voice
was
extreme
yet
he
did
not
like
to
say
no
while
he
hesitated
domini
continued
you
remember
when
i
asked
you
to
ride
yes
that
was
new
to
you
well
it
has
given
you
pleasure
hasn
t
it
yes
so
will
the
garden
i
want
to
put
another
pleasure
into
your
she
had
begun
to
speak
with
the
light
persuasiveness
of
a
woman
of
the
world
wishing
to
overcome
a
man
s
diffidence
or
obstinacy
but
while
she
said
the
words
she
felt
a
sudden
earnestness
rush
over
her
it
went
into
the
voice
and
surely
smote
upon
him
like
a
gust
of
the
hot
wind
that
sometimes
blows
out
of
the
desert
i
shall
come
madame
he
said
quickly
friday
i
may
be
in
the
garden
in
the
morning
i
ll
meet
you
at
the
gate
at
friday
he
said
already
he
seemed
to
be
wavering
in
his
acceptance
domini
did
not
stay
with
him
any
longer
i
m
glad
she
said
in
a
finishing
tone
and
she
went
away
now
count
anteoni
told
her
that
he
had
invited
the
priest
she
felt
vexed
and
her
face
showed
that
she
did
a
cloud
came
down
and
immediately
she
looked
changed
and
disquieting
yet
she
liked
the
priest
as
she
sat
in
silence
her
vexation
became
more
profound
she
felt
certain
that
if
androvsky
had
known
the
priest
was
coming
he
would
not
have
accepted
the
invitation
she
wished
him
to
come
yet
she
wished
he
had
known
he
might
think
that
she
had
known
the
fact
and
had
concealed
it
she
did
not
suppose
for
a
moment
that
he
disliked
father
roubier
personally
but
he
certainly
avoided
him
he
bowed
to
him
in
the
of
the
hotel
but
never
spoke
to
him
batouch
had
told
her
about
the
episode
with
and
she
had
seen
endeavour
to
renew
the
intimacy
and
repulsed
with
determination
androvsky
must
dislike
the
priesthood
he
might
fancy
that
she
a
believing
catholic
had
a
number
of
disagreeable
suppositions
ran
through
her
mind
she
had
always
been
inclined
to
hate
the
propagandist
since
the
tragedy
in
her
family
it
was
a
pity
count
anteoni
had
not
indulged
his
imp
in
a
different
fashion
the
beauty
of
the
noon
seemed
spoiled
forgive
my
malice
count
anteoni
said
it
was
really
a
thing
of
thistledown
can
it
be
going
to
do
harm
i
can
scarcely
think
no
she
roused
herself
with
the
instinct
of
a
woman
who
has
lived
much
in
the
world
to
conceal
the
vexation
that
visible
would
cause
a
depression
to
stand
in
the
natural
place
of
cheerfulness
the
desert
is
making
me
abominably
natural
she
thought
at
this
moment
the
black
figure
of
father
roubier
came
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
trees
with
trotting
importantly
beside
it
ah
father
said
count
anteoni
going
to
meet
him
while
domini
got
up
from
her
chair
it
is
good
of
you
to
come
out
in
the
sun
to
eat
fish
with
such
a
bad
parishioner
as
i
am
your
little
companion
is
he
patted
who
took
little
notice
of
him
you
know
miss
enfilden
i
think
continued
the
count
father
roubier
and
i
meet
every
day
said
domini
smiling
mademoiselle
has
been
good
enough
to
take
a
kind
interest
in
the
humble
work
of
the
church
in
said
the
priest
with
the
serious
simplicity
characteristic
of
him
he
was
a
sincere
man
utterly
without
pretension
and
as
such
men
often
are
quietly
at
home
with
anybody
of
whatever
class
or
creed
i
must
go
to
the
garden
gate
domini
said
will
you
excuse
me
for
a
moment
to
meet
monsieur
androvsky
let
us
accompany
you
if
father
roubier
please
don
t
trouble
i
won
t
be
a
something
in
her
voice
made
count
anteoni
at
once
acquiesce
defying
his
courteous
instinct
we
will
wait
for
you
here
he
said
there
was
a
whimsical
plea
for
forgiveness
in
his
eyes
domini
s
did
not
reject
it
they
did
not
answer
it
she
walked
away
and
the
two
men
looked
after
her
tall
figure
with
admiration
as
she
went
along
the
sand
paths
between
the
little
streams
and
came
into
the
deep
shade
her
vexation
seemed
to
grow
darker
like
the
garden
ways
for
a
moment
she
thought
she
understood
the
sensations
that
must
surely
sometimes
beset
a
treacherous
woman
yet
she
was
incapable
of
treachery
smain
was
standing
dreamily
on
the
great
sweep
of
sand
before
the
villa
she
and
he
were
old
friends
now
and
every
day
he
calmly
gave
her
a
flower
when
she
came
into
the
garden
what
time
is
it
smain
nearly
twelve
will
you
open
the
door
and
see
if
anyone
is
coming
he
went
towards
the
great
door
and
domini
sat
down
on
a
bench
under
the
evergreen
roof
to
wait
she
had
seldom
felt
more
discomposed
and
began
to
reason
with
herself
almost
angrily
even
if
the
presence
of
the
priest
was
unpleasant
to
androvsky
why
should
she
mind
antagonism
to
the
priesthood
was
certainly
not
a
mental
condition
to
be
fostered
but
a
prejudice
to
be
broken
down
but
she
had
wished
she
still
wished
with
ardour
that
androvsky
s
first
visit
to
the
garden
should
be
a
happy
one
should
pass
off
delightfully
she
had
a
dawning
instinct
to
make
things
smooth
for
him
surely
they
had
been
rough
in
the
past
rougher
even
than
for
herself
and
she
wondered
for
an
instant
whether
he
had
come
to
as
she
had
come
vaguely
seeking
for
a
happiness
scarcely
embodied
in
a
definite
thought
there
is
a
gentleman
coming
it
was
the
soft
voice
of
smain
from
the
gate
in
a
moment
androvsky
stood
before
it
domini
saw
him
framed
in
the
white
wood
with
a
brilliant
blue
behind
him
and
a
narrow
glimpse
of
the
watercourse
he
was
standing
still
and
hesitating
monsieur
androvsky
she
called
he
started
looked
across
the
sand
and
stepped
into
the
garden
with
a
sort
of
reluctant
caution
that
pained
her
she
scarcely
knew
why
she
got
up
and
went
towards
him
and
they
met
full
in
the
sunshine
i
came
to
be
your
thank
you
there
was
the
click
of
wood
striking
against
wood
as
smain
closed
the
gate
androvsky
turned
quickly
and
looked
behind
him
his
demeanour
was
that
of
a
man
whose
nerves
were
tormenting
him
domini
began
to
dread
telling
him
of
the
presence
of
the
priest
and
characteristically
did
without
hesitation
what
she
feared
to
do
this
is
the
way
she
said
then
as
they
turned
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
began
to
walk
between
the
rills
of
water
she
added
abruptly
father
roubier
is
here
already
so
our
party
is
androvsky
stood
still
father
roubier
you
did
not
tell
me
he
was
i
did
not
know
it
till
five
minutes
she
stood
still
too
and
looked
at
him
there
was
a
flaming
of
distrust
in
his
eyes
his
lips
were
compressed
and
his
whole
body
betokened
hostility
i
did
not
understand
i
thought
senor
anteoni
would
be
alone
father
roubier
is
a
pleasant
companion
sincere
and
simple
everyone
likes
no
doubt
madame
but
the
fact
is
i
he
hesitated
then
added
almost
with
violence
i
do
not
care
for
i
am
sorry
still
for
once
for
an
hour
you
can
surely
she
did
not
finish
the
sentence
while
she
was
speaking
she
felt
the
banality
of
such
phrases
spoken
to
such
a
man
and
suddenly
changed
tone
and
manner
monsieur
androvsky
she
said
laying
one
hand
on
his
arm
i
knew
you
would
not
like
father
roubier
s
being
here
if
i
had
known
he
was
coming
i
should
have
told
you
in
order
that
you
might
have
kept
away
if
you
wished
to
but
now
that
you
are
here
now
that
smain
has
let
you
in
and
the
count
and
father
roubier
must
know
of
it
i
am
sure
you
will
stay
and
govern
your
dislike
you
intend
to
turn
back
i
see
that
well
i
ask
you
to
she
was
not
thinking
of
herself
but
of
him
instinct
told
her
to
teach
him
the
way
to
conceal
his
aversion
retreat
would
proclaim
it
for
yourself
i
ask
you
she
added
if
you
go
you
tell
them
what
you
have
told
me
you
don
t
wish
to
do
they
looked
at
each
other
then
without
a
word
he
walked
on
again
as
she
kept
beside
him
she
felt
as
if
in
that
moment
their
acquaintanceship
had
sprung
forward
like
a
thing
that
had
been
forcibly
restrained
and
that
was
now
sharply
released
they
did
not
speak
again
till
they
saw
at
the
end
of
an
alley
the
count
and
the
priest
standing
together
beneath
the
jamelon
tree
ran
forward
barking
and
domini
was
conscious
that
androvsky
braced
himself
up
like
a
fighter
stepping
into
the
arena
her
keen
sensitiveness
of
mind
and
body
was
so
infected
by
his
secret
impetuosity
of
feeling
that
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
his
encounter
with
the
two
men
framed
in
the
sunlight
were
a
great
event
which
might
be
fraught
with
strange
consequences
she
almost
held
her
breath
as
she
and
androvsky
came
down
the
path
and
the
fierce
sunrays
reached
out
to
light
up
their
faces
count
anteoni
stepped
forward
to
greet
them
monsieur
androvsky
count
anteoni
she
said
the
hands
of
the
two
men
met
she
saw
that
androvsky
s
was
lifted
reluctantly
welcome
to
my
garden
count
anteoni
said
with
his
invariable
easy
courtesy
every
traveller
has
to
pay
his
tribute
to
my
domain
i
dare
to
exact
that
as
the
oldest
european
inhabitant
of
androvsky
said
nothing
his
eyes
were
on
the
priest
the
count
noticed
it
and
added
do
you
know
father
roubier
we
have
often
seen
each
other
in
the
hotel
father
roubier
said
with
his
usual
straightforward
simplicity
he
held
out
his
hand
but
androvsky
bowed
hastily
and
awkwardly
and
did
not
seem
to
see
it
domini
glanced
at
count
anteoni
and
surprised
a
piercing
expression
in
his
bright
eyes
it
died
away
at
once
and
he
said
let
us
go
to
the
will
be
ready
miss
she
joined
him
concealing
her
reluctance
to
leave
androvsky
with
the
priest
and
walked
beside
him
down
the
path
preceded
by
is
my
going
to
be
a
failure
he
murmured
she
did
not
reply
her
heart
was
full
of
vexation
almost
of
bitterness
she
felt
angry
with
count
anteoni
with
androvsky
with
herself
she
almost
felt
angry
with
poor
father
roubier
forgive
me
do
forgive
me
the
count
whispered
i
meant
no
she
forced
herself
to
smile
but
the
silence
behind
them
where
the
two
men
were
following
oppressed
her
if
only
androvsky
would
speak
he
had
not
said
one
word
since
they
were
all
together
suddenly
she
turned
her
head
and
said
did
you
ever
see
such
palms
monsieur
androvsky
aren
t
they
magnificent
her
voice
was
challenging
imperative
it
commanded
him
to
rouse
himself
to
speak
as
a
touch
of
the
lash
commands
a
horse
to
quicken
his
pace
androvsky
raised
his
head
which
had
been
sunk
on
his
breast
as
he
walked
palms
he
said
confusedly
yes
they
are
you
care
for
trees
asked
the
count
following
domini
s
lead
and
speaking
with
a
definite
intention
to
force
a
conversation
yes
monsieur
i
have
some
wonderful
fellows
here
after
you
must
let
me
show
them
to
you
i
spent
years
in
collecting
my
children
and
teaching
them
to
live
rightly
in
the
very
naturally
while
he
spoke
he
had
joined
androvsky
and
now
walked
on
with
him
pointing
out
the
different
varieties
of
trees
domini
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
relief
and
of
a
strong
feeling
of
gratitude
to
their
host
following
upon
the
gratitude
came
a
less
pleasant
consciousness
of
androvsky
s
lack
of
good
breeding
he
was
certainly
not
a
man
of
the
world
whatever
he
might
be
perhaps
absurdly
she
felt
responsible
for
him
and
as
if
he
owed
it
to
her
to
bear
himself
bravely
and
govern
his
dislikes
if
they
clashed
with
the
feelings
of
his
companions
she
longed
hotly
for
him
to
make
a
good
impression
and
when
her
eyes
met
father
roubier
s
was
almost
moved
to
ask
his
pardon
for
androvsky
s
rudeness
but
the
father
seemed
unconscious
of
it
and
began
to
speak
about
the
splendour
of
the
african
vegetation
does
not
its
luxuriance
surprise
you
after
england
he
said
no
she
replied
bluntly
ever
since
i
have
been
in
africa
i
have
felt
that
i
was
in
a
land
of
passionate
but
the
desert
he
replied
with
a
gesture
towards
the
long
flats
of
the
sahara
which
were
still
visible
between
the
trees
i
should
find
it
there
too
she
answered
there
perhaps
most
of
he
looked
at
her
with
a
gentle
wonder
she
did
not
explain
that
she
was
no
longer
thinking
of
growth
in
nature
the
stood
at
the
end
of
a
broad
avenue
of
palms
not
far
from
the
villa
two
arab
servants
were
waiting
on
each
side
of
the
white
step
that
led
into
an
filled
with
divans
and
beyond
was
a
lofty
apartment
with
an
arched
roof
in
the
centre
of
which
was
an
oval
table
laid
for
breakfast
and
decorated
with
masses
of
scarlet
flowers
in
silver
vases
behind
each
of
the
four
chairs
stood
an
arab
motionless
as
a
statue
evidently
the
count
s
was
to
be
attended
by
a
good
deal
of
ceremony
domini
felt
sorry
though
not
for
herself
she
had
been
accustomed
to
ceremony
all
her
life
and
noticed
it
as
a
rule
almost
as
little
as
the
air
she
breathed
but
she
feared
that
to
androvsky
it
would
be
novel
and
unpleasant
as
they
came
into
the
shady
room
she
saw
him
glance
swiftly
at
the
walls
covered
with
dark
persian
hangings
at
the
servants
in
their
embroidered
jackets
wide
trousers
and
turbans
at
the
vivid
flowers
on
the
table
then
at
the
tall
windows
over
which
flexible
outside
blinds
dull
green
in
colour
were
drawn
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
feeling
like
a
trapped
animal
full
of
a
fury
of
uneasiness
father
roubier
s
unconscious
serenity
in
the
midst
of
a
luxury
to
which
he
was
quite
unaccustomed
emphasised
androvsky
s
secret
agitation
which
was
no
secret
to
domini
and
which
she
knew
must
be
obvious
to
count
anteoni
she
began
to
wish
ardently
that
she
had
let
androvsky
follow
his
impulse
to
go
when
he
heard
of
father
roubier
s
presence
they
sat
down
she
was
on
the
count
s
right
hand
with
androvsky
opposite
to
her
and
father
roubier
on
her
left
as
they
took
their
places
she
and
the
father
said
a
silent
grace
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
when
she
glanced
up
after
doing
so
she
saw
androvsky
s
hand
lifted
to
his
forehead
for
a
moment
she
fancied
that
he
had
joined
in
the
tiny
prayer
and
was
about
to
make
the
sacred
sign
but
as
she
looked
at
him
his
hand
fell
heavily
to
the
table
the
glasses
by
his
plate
jingled
i
only
remembered
this
morning
that
this
is
a
said
count
anteoni
as
they
unfolded
their
napkins
i
am
afraid
father
roubier
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
full
justice
to
my
chef
hamdane
although
he
has
thought
of
you
and
done
his
best
for
you
but
i
hope
miss
enfilden
and
i
keep
friday
domini
interrupted
quietly
yes
poor
hamdane
he
looked
in
grave
despair
but
she
knew
that
he
was
really
pleased
that
she
kept
the
fast
day
anyhow
he
continued
i
hope
that
you
monsieur
androvsky
will
be
able
to
join
me
in
testing
hamdane
s
powers
to
the
full
or
are
you
too
he
did
not
continue
for
androvsky
at
once
said
in
a
loud
and
firm
voice
i
keep
no
fast
the
words
sounded
like
a
defiance
flung
at
the
two
catholics
and
for
a
moment
domini
thought
that
father
roubier
was
going
to
treat
them
as
a
challenge
for
he
lifted
his
head
and
there
was
a
flash
of
sudden
fire
in
his
eyes
but
he
only
said
turning
to
the
count
i
think
mademoiselle
and
i
shall
find
our
little
ramadan
a
very
easy
business
i
once
breakfasted
with
you
on
a
friday
two
years
ago
it
was
i
think
and
i
have
not
forgotten
the
banquet
you
gave
domini
felt
as
if
the
priest
had
snubbed
androvsky
as
a
saint
might
snub
without
knowing
that
he
did
so
she
was
angry
with
androvsky
and
yet
she
was
full
of
pity
for
him
why
could
he
not
meet
courtesy
with
graciousness
there
was
something
almost
inhuman
in
his
demeanour
he
had
returned
to
his
worst
self
to
the
man
who
had
twice
treated
her
with
brutal
rudeness
do
the
arabs
really
keep
ramadan
strictly
she
asked
looking
away
from
androvsky
very
said
father
roubier
although
of
course
i
am
not
in
sympathy
with
their
religion
i
have
often
been
moved
by
their
adherence
to
its
rules
there
is
something
very
grand
in
the
human
heart
deliberately
taking
upon
itself
the
yoke
of
islam
the
very
word
means
the
surrender
of
the
human
will
to
the
will
of
god
said
count
anteoni
that
word
and
its
meaning
lie
like
the
shadow
of
a
commanding
hand
on
the
soul
of
every
arab
even
of
the
renegades
one
sees
here
and
there
who
have
caught
the
vices
of
their
conquerors
in
the
greatest
scoundrel
that
the
prophet
s
robe
covers
there
is
an
abiding
and
acute
sense
of
necessary
surrender
the
arabs
at
any
rate
do
not
buzz
against
their
creator
like
midges
raging
at
the
sun
in
whose
beams
they
are
no
assented
the
priest
at
least
in
that
respect
they
are
superior
to
many
who
call
themselves
christians
their
pride
is
immense
but
it
never
makes
itself
you
mean
by
trying
to
defy
the
divine
will
said
domini
exactly
she
thought
of
her
dead
father
the
servants
stole
round
the
table
handing
various
dishes
noiselessly
one
of
them
at
this
moment
poured
red
wine
into
androvsky
s
glass
he
uttered
a
low
exclamation
that
sounded
like
the
beginning
of
a
protest
hastily
checked
you
prefer
white
wine
said
count
anteoni
no
thank
you
he
lifted
the
glass
to
his
lips
and
drained
it
are
you
a
judge
of
wine
added
the
count
that
is
made
from
my
own
grapes
i
have
vineyards
near
it
is
excellent
said
androvsky
domini
noticed
that
he
spoke
in
a
louder
voice
than
usual
as
if
he
were
making
a
determined
effort
to
throw
off
the
uneasiness
that
evidently
oppressed
him
he
ate
heartily
choosing
almost
ostentatiously
dishes
in
which
there
was
meat
but
everything
that
he
did
even
this
eating
of
meat
gave
her
the
impression
that
he
was
subtly
how
she
did
not
know
defying
not
only
the
priest
but
himself
now
and
then
she
glanced
across
at
him
and
when
she
did
so
he
was
always
looking
away
from
her
after
praising
the
wine
he
had
relapsed
into
silence
and
count
anteoni
she
thought
moved
by
a
very
delicate
sense
of
tact
did
not
directly
address
him
again
just
then
but
resumed
the
interrupted
conversation
about
the
arabs
first
explaining
that
the
servants
understood
no
french
he
discussed
them
with
a
minute
knowledge
that
evidently
sprang
from
a
very
real
affection
and
presently
she
could
not
help
alluding
to
this
i
think
you
love
the
arabs
far
more
than
any
europeans
she
said
he
fixed
his
bright
eyes
upon
her
and
she
thought
that
just
then
they
looked
brighter
than
ever
before
why
he
asked
quietly
do
you
know
the
sound
that
comes
into
the
voice
of
a
lover
of
children
when
it
speaks
of
a
child
ah
the
note
of
a
deep
indulgence
i
hear
it
in
yours
whenever
you
speak
of
the
she
spoke
half
jestingly
for
a
moment
he
did
not
reply
then
he
said
to
the
priest
you
have
lived
long
in
africa
father
have
not
you
something
of
the
same
feeling
towards
these
children
of
the
sun
yes
and
i
have
noticed
it
in
our
dead
cardinal
androvsky
bent
over
his
plate
he
seemed
suddenly
to
withdraw
his
mind
forcibly
from
this
conversation
in
which
he
was
taking
no
active
part
as
if
he
refused
even
to
listen
to
it
he
is
your
hero
i
know
the
count
said
sympathetically
he
did
a
great
deal
for
and
for
africa
and
he
was
you
mean
in
some
special
way
domini
said
yes
he
looked
deep
enough
into
the
dark
souls
of
the
desert
men
to
find
out
that
his
success
with
them
must
come
chiefly
through
his
goodness
to
their
dark
bodies
you
aren
t
shocked
father
no
no
there
is
truth
in
but
the
priest
assented
rather
sadly
mahomet
thought
too
much
of
the
body
he
added
domini
saw
the
count
compress
his
lips
then
he
turned
to
androvsky
and
said
do
you
think
so
monsieur
it
was
a
definite
a
resolute
attempt
to
draw
his
guest
into
the
conversation
androvsky
could
not
ignore
it
he
looked
up
reluctantly
from
his
plate
his
eyes
met
domini
s
but
immediately
travelled
away
from
them
i
doubt
he
said
he
paused
laid
his
hands
on
the
table
clasping
its
edge
and
continued
firmly
even
with
a
sort
of
hard
violence
i
doubt
if
most
good
men
or
men
who
want
to
be
good
think
enough
about
the
body
consider
it
enough
i
have
thought
that
i
think
it
as
he
finished
he
stared
at
the
priest
almost
menacingly
then
as
if
moved
by
an
he
added
as
to
mahomet
i
know
very
little
about
him
but
perhaps
he
obtained
his
great
influence
by
recognising
that
the
bodies
of
men
are
of
great
importance
of
tremendous
tremendous
domini
saw
that
the
interest
of
count
anteoni
in
his
guest
was
suddenly
and
vitally
aroused
by
what
he
had
just
said
perhaps
even
more
by
his
peculiar
way
of
saying
it
as
if
it
were
forced
from
him
by
some
secret
irresistible
compulsion
and
the
count
s
interest
seemed
to
take
hands
with
her
interest
which
had
had
a
much
longer
existence
father
roubier
however
broke
in
with
a
slightly
cold
it
is
a
very
dangerous
thing
i
think
to
dwell
upon
the
importance
of
the
perishable
one
runs
the
risk
of
detracting
from
the
much
greater
importance
of
the
yet
it
s
the
starved
wolves
that
devour
the
villages
said
androvsky
for
the
first
time
domini
felt
his
russian
origin
there
was
a
silence
father
roubier
looked
straight
before
him
but
count
anteoni
s
eyes
were
fixed
piercingly
upon
androvsky
at
last
he
said
may
i
ask
monsieur
if
you
are
a
russian
my
father
was
but
i
have
never
set
foot
in
the
soul
that
i
find
in
the
art
music
literature
of
your
country
is
to
me
the
most
interesting
soul
in
europe
the
count
said
with
a
ring
of
deep
earnestness
in
his
grating
voice
spoken
as
he
spoke
it
no
compliment
could
have
been
more
gracious
even
moving
but
androvsky
only
replied
abruptly
i
m
afraid
i
know
nothing
of
all
domini
felt
hot
with
a
sort
of
shame
as
at
a
close
friend
s
public
display
of
ignorance
she
began
to
speak
to
the
count
of
russian
music
books
with
an
enthusiasm
that
was
sincere
for
she
too
had
found
in
the
soul
from
the
steppes
a
meaning
and
a
magic
that
had
taken
her
soul
prisoner
and
suddenly
while
she
talked
she
thought
of
the
desert
as
the
burning
brother
of
the
frigid
steppes
was
it
the
wonder
of
the
eternal
flats
that
had
spoken
to
her
inmost
heart
sometimes
in
london
in
her
room
at
night
when
she
read
forgetting
time
which
spoke
to
her
now
more
fiercely
under
the
palms
of
africa
at
the
thought
something
mystic
seemed
to
stand
in
her
enthusiasm
the
mystery
of
space
floated
about
her
but
she
did
not
express
her
thought
count
anteoni
expressed
it
for
her
the
steppes
and
the
desert
are
akin
you
know
he
said
despite
the
opposition
of
frost
and
just
what
i
was
thinking
she
exclaimed
that
must
be
why
she
stopped
short
yes
said
the
count
both
father
roubier
and
androvsky
looked
at
her
with
expectancy
but
she
did
not
continue
her
sentence
and
her
failure
to
do
so
was
covered
or
at
the
least
excused
by
a
diversion
that
secretly
she
blessed
at
this
moment
from
the
there
came
a
sound
of
african
music
both
soft
and
barbarous
first
there
was
only
one
reiterated
liquid
note
clear
and
glassy
a
note
that
suggested
night
in
a
remote
place
then
beneath
it
as
foundation
to
it
rose
a
rustling
sound
as
of
a
forest
of
reeds
through
which
a
breeze
went
rhythmically
into
this
stole
the
broken
song
of
a
thin
instrument
with
a
timbre
rustic
and
antique
as
the
timbre
of
the
oboe
but
fainter
frailer
a
twang
of
strings
supported
its
wild
and
pathetic
utterance
and
presently
the
almost
stifled
throb
of
a
little
tomtom
that
must
have
been
placed
at
a
distance
it
was
like
a
beating
heart
the
count
and
his
guests
sat
listening
in
silence
domini
began
to
feel
curiously
expectant
yet
she
did
not
recognise
the
odd
melody
her
sensation
was
that
some
other
music
must
be
coming
which
she
had
heard
before
which
had
moved
her
deeply
at
some
time
in
her
life
she
glanced
at
the
count
and
found
him
looking
at
her
with
a
whimsical
expression
as
if
he
were
a
kind
conspirator
whose
plot
would
soon
be
known
what
is
it
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
he
bent
towards
her
wait
he
whispered
listen
she
saw
androvsky
frown
his
face
was
distorted
by
an
expression
of
pain
and
she
wondered
if
he
like
some
europeans
found
the
barbarity
of
the
desert
music
ugly
and
even
distressing
to
the
nerves
while
she
wondered
a
voice
began
to
sing
always
accompanied
by
the
four
instruments
it
was
a
contralto
voice
but
sounded
like
a
youth
s
what
is
that
song
she
asked
under
her
breath
surely
i
must
have
heard
it
you
don
t
know
wait
she
searched
her
heart
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
knew
the
song
at
some
period
of
her
life
she
had
certainly
been
deeply
moved
by
it
but
when
where
the
voice
died
away
and
was
succeeded
by
a
soft
chorus
singing
monotonously
then
it
rose
once
more
in
a
dreamy
and
reticent
refrain
like
the
voice
of
a
soul
communing
with
itself
in
the
desert
above
the
instruments
and
the
murmuring
chorus
you
remember
whispered
the
count
she
moved
her
head
in
assent
but
did
not
speak
she
could
not
speak
it
was
the
song
the
arab
had
sung
as
he
turned
into
the
shadow
of
the
palm
trees
the
song
of
the
freed
negroes
of
touggourt
no
one
but
god
and
i
knows
what
is
in
my
the
priest
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
dark
eyes
were
cast
down
and
his
thin
hands
were
folded
together
in
a
way
that
suggested
prayer
did
this
desert
song
of
the
black
men
children
of
god
like
him
as
their
song
affirmed
stir
his
soul
to
some
grave
petition
that
embraced
the
wants
of
all
humanity
androvsky
was
sitting
quite
still
he
was
also
looking
down
and
the
lids
covered
his
eyes
an
expression
of
pain
still
lingered
on
his
face
but
it
was
less
cruel
no
longer
tortured
but
melancholy
and
domini
as
she
listened
recalled
the
strange
cry
that
had
risen
within
her
as
the
arab
disappeared
in
the
sunshine
the
cry
of
the
soul
in
life
surrounded
by
mysteries
by
the
hands
the
footfalls
the
voices
of
hidden
things
what
is
going
to
happen
to
me
here
but
that
cry
had
risen
in
her
found
words
in
her
only
when
confronted
by
the
desert
before
it
had
been
perhaps
hidden
in
the
womb
only
then
was
it
born
and
now
the
days
had
passed
and
the
nights
and
the
song
brought
with
it
the
cry
once
more
the
cry
and
suddenly
something
else
another
voice
that
very
far
away
seemed
to
be
making
answer
to
it
that
answer
she
could
not
hear
the
words
of
it
were
hidden
in
the
womb
as
once
the
words
of
her
intense
question
only
she
felt
that
an
answer
had
been
made
the
future
knew
and
had
begun
to
try
to
tell
her
she
was
on
the
very
edge
of
knowledge
while
she
listened
but
she
could
not
step
into
the
marvellous
land
presently
count
anteoni
spoke
to
the
priest
you
have
heard
this
song
no
doubt
father
father
roubier
shook
his
head
i
don
t
think
so
but
i
can
never
remember
the
arab
music
perhaps
you
dislike
it
no
no
it
is
ugly
in
a
way
but
there
seems
a
great
deal
of
meaning
in
it
in
this
song
especially
there
is
one
might
almost
call
it
wonderful
beauty
domini
said
in
a
low
voice
still
listening
to
the
song
the
words
are
beautiful
said
the
count
this
time
addressing
himself
to
androvsky
i
don
t
know
them
all
but
they
begin
like
this
the
gazelle
dies
in
the
water
the
fish
dies
in
the
air
and
i
die
in
the
dunes
of
the
desert
sand
for
my
love
that
is
deep
and
and
when
the
chorus
sounds
as
now
and
he
made
a
gesture
toward
the
inner
room
in
which
the
low
murmur
of
rose
again
the
singer
reiterates
always
the
same
refrain
no
one
but
god
and
i
knows
what
is
in
my
almost
as
he
spoke
the
contralto
voice
began
to
sing
the
refrain
androvsky
turned
pale
there
were
drops
of
sweat
on
his
forehead
he
lifted
his
glass
of
wine
to
his
lips
and
his
hand
trembled
so
that
some
of
the
wine
was
spilt
upon
the
tablecloth
and
as
once
before
domini
felt
that
what
moved
her
deeply
moved
him
even
more
deeply
whether
in
the
same
way
or
differently
she
could
not
tell
the
image
of
the
taper
and
the
torch
recurred
to
her
mind
she
saw
androvsky
with
fire
round
about
him
the
violence
of
this
man
surely
resembled
the
violence
of
africa
there
was
something
terrible
about
it
yet
also
something
noble
for
it
suggested
a
male
power
which
might
make
for
either
good
or
evil
but
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
littleness
for
a
moment
count
anteoni
and
the
priest
were
dwarfed
as
if
they
had
come
into
the
presence
of
a
giant
the
arabs
handed
round
fruit
and
now
the
song
died
softly
away
only
the
instruments
went
on
playing
the
distant
tomtom
was
surely
the
beating
of
that
heart
into
whose
mysteries
no
other
human
heart
could
look
its
reiterated
and
dim
throbbing
affected
domini
almost
terribly
she
was
relieved
yet
regretful
when
at
length
it
ceased
shall
we
go
into
the
the
count
said
coffee
will
be
brought
oh
but
don
t
let
us
see
them
domini
exclaimed
the
musicians
she
nodded
you
would
rather
not
hear
any
more
music
if
you
don
t
mind
he
gave
an
order
in
arabic
one
of
the
servants
slipped
away
and
returned
almost
immediately
now
we
can
go
the
count
said
they
have
the
priest
sighed
it
was
evident
that
the
music
had
moved
him
too
as
they
got
up
he
said
yes
there
was
beauty
in
that
song
and
something
more
some
of
these
desert
poets
can
teach
us
to
a
dangerous
lesson
perhaps
said
the
count
what
do
you
say
monsieur
androvsky
androvsky
was
on
his
feet
his
eyes
were
turned
toward
the
door
through
which
the
sound
of
the
music
had
come
i
he
answered
i
monsieur
i
am
afraid
that
to
me
this
music
means
very
little
i
can
not
judge
of
but
the
words
asked
the
count
with
a
certain
pressure
they
do
not
seem
to
me
to
suggest
much
more
than
the
the
count
said
no
more
as
she
went
into
the
outer
room
domini
felt
angry
as
she
had
felt
angry
in
the
garden
at
when
androvsky
said
these
native
women
do
not
interest
me
i
see
nothing
attractive
in
for
now
as
then
she
knew
that
he
had
lied
chapter
xi
domini
came
into
the
alone
the
three
men
had
paused
for
a
moment
behind
her
and
the
sound
of
a
match
struck
reached
her
ears
as
she
went
listlessly
forward
to
the
door
which
was
open
to
the
broad
garden
path
and
stood
looking
out
into
the
sunshine
butterflies
were
flitting
here
and
there
through
the
riot
of
gold
and
she
heard
faint
from
the
shadows
of
the
trees
echoed
by
the
more
distant
twitter
of
larbi
s
flute
on
the
left
between
the
palms
she
caught
glimpses
of
the
desert
and
of
the
hard
and
brilliant
mountains
and
as
she
stood
there
she
remembered
her
sensations
on
first
entering
the
garden
and
how
soon
she
had
learned
to
love
it
it
had
always
seemed
to
her
a
sunny
paradise
of
peace
until
this
moment
but
now
she
felt
as
if
she
were
compassed
about
by
clouds
the
vagrant
movement
of
the
butterflies
irritated
her
eyes
the
distant
sound
of
the
flute
distressed
her
ears
and
all
the
peace
had
gone
once
again
this
man
destroyed
the
spell
nature
had
cast
upon
her
because
she
knew
that
he
had
lied
her
joy
in
the
garden
her
deeper
joy
in
the
desert
that
embraced
it
were
stricken
yet
why
should
he
not
lie
which
of
us
does
not
lie
about
his
feelings
has
reserve
no
right
to
armour
she
heard
her
companions
entering
the
room
and
turned
round
at
that
moment
her
heart
was
swept
by
an
emotion
almost
of
hatred
to
androvsky
because
of
it
she
smiled
a
forced
gaiety
dawned
in
her
she
sat
down
on
one
of
the
low
divans
and
as
she
asked
count
anteoni
for
a
cigarette
and
lit
it
she
thought
how
shall
i
punish
him
that
lie
not
even
told
to
her
and
about
so
slight
a
matter
seemed
to
her
an
attack
which
she
resented
and
must
return
not
for
a
moment
did
she
ask
herself
if
she
were
reasonable
a
voice
within
her
said
i
will
not
be
lied
to
i
will
not
even
bear
a
lie
told
to
another
in
my
presence
by
this
and
the
voice
was
imperious
count
anteoni
remained
beside
her
smoking
a
cigar
father
roubier
took
a
seat
by
the
little
table
in
front
of
her
but
androvsky
went
over
to
the
door
she
had
just
left
and
stood
as
she
had
looking
out
into
the
sunshine
followed
him
and
snuffed
affectionately
round
his
feet
trying
to
gain
his
attention
my
little
dog
seems
very
fond
of
your
friend
the
priest
said
to
domini
my
friend
monsieur
she
lowered
her
voice
he
is
only
a
travelling
acquaintance
i
know
nothing
of
the
priest
looked
gently
surprised
and
count
anteoni
blew
forth
a
fragrant
cloud
of
smoke
he
seems
a
remarkable
man
the
priest
said
mildly
do
you
think
so
she
began
to
speak
to
count
anteoni
about
some
absurdity
of
batouch
forcing
her
mind
into
a
light
and
frivolous
mood
and
he
echoed
her
tone
with
a
clever
obedience
for
which
secretly
she
blessed
him
in
a
moment
they
were
laughing
together
with
apparent
merriment
and
father
roubier
smiled
innocently
at
their
believing
in
it
sincerely
but
androvsky
suddenly
turned
around
with
a
dark
and
morose
countenance
come
in
out
of
the
sunshine
said
the
count
it
is
too
strong
try
this
chair
coffee
will
be
ah
here
it
is
two
servants
appeared
carrying
it
thank
you
monsieur
androvsky
said
with
reluctant
courtesy
he
came
towards
them
with
determination
and
sat
down
drawing
forward
his
chair
till
he
was
facing
domini
directly
he
was
quiet
sprang
upon
his
knee
and
lay
down
hastily
blinking
his
eyes
which
were
almost
concealed
by
hair
and
heaving
a
sigh
which
made
the
priest
look
kindly
at
him
even
while
he
said
deprecatingly
little
rascal
little
pig
down
down
oh
leave
him
monsieur
muttered
androvsky
it
s
all
the
same
to
he
really
has
no
shame
where
his
heart
is
arab
said
the
count
he
has
learnt
it
in
perhaps
he
has
taken
lessons
from
larbi
said
domini
hark
he
is
playing
for
whom
i
never
ask
now
said
the
count
the
name
changes
so
constancy
is
not
an
arab
fault
domini
asked
you
say
fault
madame
interposed
the
priest
yes
father
she
returned
with
a
light
touch
of
conscious
cynicism
surely
in
this
world
that
which
is
apt
to
bring
inevitable
misery
with
it
must
be
accounted
a
but
can
constancy
do
that
don
t
you
think
so
into
a
world
of
ceaseless
change
then
how
shall
we
reckon
truth
in
a
world
of
lies
asked
the
count
is
that
a
fault
too
ask
monsieur
androvsky
said
domini
quickly
i
obey
said
the
count
looking
over
at
his
guest
ah
but
i
am
sure
i
know
domini
added
i
am
sure
you
think
truth
a
thing
we
should
all
avoid
in
such
a
world
as
this
don
t
you
monsieur
if
you
are
sure
madame
why
ask
me
androvsky
replied
there
was
in
his
voice
a
sound
that
was
startling
suddenly
the
priest
reached
out
his
hand
and
lifted
on
to
his
knee
and
count
anteoni
very
lightly
and
indifferently
interposed
among
arabs
becomes
a
dire
necessity
to
europeans
one
can
not
them
and
it
doesn
t
pay
to
run
second
to
orientals
so
one
learns
with
tears
to
be
sincere
father
roubier
is
shocked
by
my
apologia
for
my
own
blatant
the
priest
laughed
i
live
so
little
in
what
is
called
the
world
that
i
m
afraid
i
m
very
ready
to
take
drollery
for
a
serious
expression
of
he
stroked
s
white
back
and
added
with
a
simple
geniality
that
seemed
to
spring
rather
from
a
desire
to
be
kind
than
from
any
temperamental
source
but
i
hope
i
shall
always
be
able
to
enjoy
innocent
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
rested
on
androvsky
s
face
and
suddenly
he
looked
grave
and
put
gently
down
on
the
floor
i
m
afraid
i
must
be
going
he
said
already
said
his
host
i
dare
not
allow
myself
too
much
idleness
if
once
i
began
to
be
idle
in
this
climate
i
should
become
like
an
arab
and
do
nothing
all
day
but
sit
in
the
as
i
do
father
we
meet
very
seldom
but
whenever
we
do
i
feel
myself
a
cumberer
of
the
domini
had
never
before
heard
him
speak
with
such
humbleness
the
priest
flushed
like
a
boy
we
each
serve
in
our
own
way
he
said
quickly
the
arab
who
sits
all
day
in
the
sun
may
be
heard
as
a
song
of
praise
where
he
and
then
he
took
his
leave
this
time
he
did
not
extend
his
hand
to
androvsky
but
only
bowed
to
him
lifting
his
white
helmet
as
he
went
away
in
the
sun
with
the
three
he
had
left
followed
him
with
their
eyes
for
androvsky
had
turned
his
chair
sideways
as
if
involuntarily
i
shall
learn
to
love
father
roubier
domini
said
androvsky
moved
his
seat
round
again
till
his
back
was
to
the
garden
and
placed
his
broad
hands
palm
downward
on
his
knees
yes
said
the
count
he
is
so
transparently
good
and
he
bears
his
great
disappointment
so
what
great
disappointment
he
longed
to
become
a
androvsky
got
up
from
his
seat
and
walked
back
to
the
garden
doorway
his
restless
demeanour
and
lowering
expression
destroyed
all
sense
of
calm
and
leisure
count
anteoni
looked
after
him
and
then
at
domini
with
a
sort
of
playful
surprise
he
was
going
to
speak
but
before
the
words
came
smain
appeared
carrying
reverently
a
large
envelope
covered
with
arab
writing
will
you
excuse
me
for
a
moment
the
count
said
of
he
took
the
letter
and
at
once
a
vivid
expression
of
excitement
shone
in
his
eyes
when
he
had
read
it
there
was
a
glow
upon
his
face
as
if
the
flames
of
a
fire
played
over
it
miss
enfilden
he
said
will
you
think
me
very
discourteous
if
i
leave
you
for
a
moment
the
messenger
who
brought
this
has
come
from
far
and
starts
on
his
return
journey
he
has
come
out
of
the
south
three
hundred
kilometres
away
from
a
sacred
village
a
sacred
he
repeated
the
last
words
lowering
his
voice
of
course
go
and
see
and
you
he
glanced
towards
androvsky
who
was
standing
with
his
back
to
them
won
t
you
show
monsieur
androvsky
the
garden
hearing
his
name
androvsky
turned
and
the
count
at
once
made
his
excuses
to
him
and
followed
smain
towards
the
garden
gate
carrying
the
letter
that
had
come
from
in
his
hand
when
he
had
gone
domini
remained
on
the
divan
and
androvsky
by
the
door
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
she
took
another
cigarette
from
the
box
on
the
table
beside
her
struck
a
match
and
lit
it
carefully
then
she
said
do
you
care
to
see
the
garden
she
spoke
indifferently
coldly
the
desire
to
show
her
paradise
to
him
had
died
away
but
the
parting
words
of
the
count
prompted
the
question
and
so
she
put
it
as
to
a
stranger
thank
you
madame
yes
he
replied
as
if
with
an
effort
she
got
up
and
they
went
out
together
on
to
the
broad
walk
which
way
do
you
want
to
go
she
asked
she
saw
him
glance
at
her
quickly
with
anxiety
in
his
eyes
you
know
best
where
we
should
go
i
daresay
you
won
t
care
about
it
probably
you
are
not
interested
in
gardens
it
does
not
matter
really
which
path
we
take
they
are
all
very
much
i
am
sure
they
are
all
very
suddenly
he
had
become
humble
anxious
to
please
her
but
now
the
violent
contrasts
in
him
unlike
the
violent
contrasts
of
nature
in
this
land
exasperated
her
she
longed
to
be
left
alone
she
felt
ashamed
of
androvsky
and
also
of
herself
she
condemned
herself
bitterly
for
the
interest
she
had
taken
in
him
for
her
desire
to
put
some
pleasure
into
a
life
she
had
deemed
sad
for
her
curiosity
about
him
for
her
wish
to
share
joy
with
him
she
laughed
at
herself
secretly
for
what
she
now
called
her
folly
in
having
connected
him
imaginatively
with
the
desert
whereas
in
reality
he
made
the
desert
as
everything
he
approached
lose
in
beauty
and
wonder
his
was
a
destructive
personality
she
knew
it
now
why
had
she
not
realised
it
before
he
was
a
man
to
put
gall
in
the
cup
of
pleasure
to
create
uneasiness
constraint
round
about
him
to
call
up
spectres
at
the
banquet
of
life
well
in
the
future
she
could
avoid
him
after
she
need
never
have
any
more
intercourse
with
him
with
that
thought
that
interior
sense
of
her
perfect
freedom
in
regard
to
this
man
an
abrupt
but
always
cold
content
came
to
her
putting
him
a
long
way
off
where
surely
all
that
he
thought
and
did
was
entirely
indifferent
to
her
come
along
then
she
said
we
ll
go
this
and
she
turned
down
an
alley
which
led
towards
the
home
of
the
purple
dog
she
did
not
know
at
the
moment
that
anything
had
influenced
her
to
choose
that
particular
path
but
very
soon
the
sound
of
larbi
s
flute
grew
louder
and
she
guessed
that
in
reality
the
music
had
attracted
her
androvsky
walked
beside
her
without
a
word
she
felt
that
he
was
not
looking
about
him
not
noticing
anything
and
all
at
once
she
stopped
decisively
why
should
we
take
all
this
trouble
she
said
bluntly
i
hate
pretence
and
i
thought
i
had
travelled
far
away
from
it
but
we
are
both
pretending
madame
he
said
in
a
startled
voice
yes
i
that
i
want
to
show
you
this
garden
you
that
you
want
to
see
it
i
no
longer
wish
to
show
it
to
you
and
you
have
never
wished
to
see
it
let
us
cease
to
pretend
it
is
all
my
fault
i
bothered
you
to
come
here
when
you
didn
t
want
to
come
you
have
taught
me
a
lesson
i
was
inclined
to
condemn
you
for
it
to
be
angry
with
you
but
why
should
i
be
you
were
quite
right
freedom
is
my
fetish
i
set
you
free
monsieur
androvsky
as
she
spoke
she
felt
that
the
air
was
clearing
the
clouds
were
flying
constraint
at
least
was
at
an
end
and
she
had
really
the
sensation
of
setting
a
captive
at
liberty
she
turned
to
leave
him
but
he
said
please
stop
why
you
have
made
a
in
what
i
do
want
to
see
this
really
well
then
you
can
wander
through
i
do
not
wish
to
see
it
larbi
shall
guide
you
for
half
a
franc
he
will
gladly
give
up
his
madame
if
you
will
not
show
me
the
garden
i
will
not
see
it
at
all
i
will
go
now
and
will
never
come
into
it
again
i
do
not
ah
she
said
and
her
voice
was
quite
changed
but
you
do
worse
yes
you
lie
in
the
face
of
she
did
not
wish
or
mean
to
say
it
and
yet
she
had
to
say
it
she
knew
it
was
monstrous
that
she
should
speak
thus
to
him
what
had
his
lies
to
do
with
her
she
had
been
told
a
thousand
had
heard
a
thousand
told
to
others
her
life
had
been
passed
in
a
world
of
which
the
words
of
the
psalmist
though
uttered
in
haste
are
a
description
and
she
had
not
thought
she
cared
yet
really
she
must
have
cared
for
in
leaving
this
world
her
soul
had
as
it
were
fetched
a
long
breath
and
now
at
the
hint
of
a
lie
it
instinctively
recoiled
as
from
a
gust
of
air
laden
with
some
poisonous
and
suffocating
vapour
forgive
me
she
added
i
am
a
fool
out
here
i
do
love
androvsky
dropped
his
eyes
his
whole
body
expressed
humiliation
and
something
that
suggested
to
her
despair
oh
you
must
think
me
mad
to
speak
like
this
she
exclaimed
of
course
people
must
be
allowed
to
arm
themselves
against
the
curiosity
of
others
i
know
that
the
fact
is
i
am
under
a
spell
here
i
have
been
living
for
many
many
years
in
the
cold
i
have
been
like
a
woman
in
a
prison
without
any
light
and
you
have
been
in
a
prison
he
said
lifting
his
head
and
looking
at
her
eagerly
i
have
been
living
in
what
is
called
the
great
and
you
call
that
a
prison
now
that
i
am
living
in
the
greater
world
really
living
at
last
i
have
been
in
the
heart
of
insincerity
and
now
i
have
come
into
the
heart
the
fiery
heart
of
sincerity
it
s
there
there
she
pointed
to
the
desert
and
it
has
intoxicated
me
i
think
it
has
made
me
unreasonable
i
expect
everyone
not
an
arab
to
be
as
it
is
and
every
little
thing
that
isn
t
quite
frank
every
pretence
is
like
a
horrible
little
hand
tugging
at
me
as
if
trying
to
take
me
back
to
the
prison
i
have
left
i
think
deep
down
i
have
always
loathed
lies
but
never
as
i
have
loathed
them
since
i
came
here
it
seems
to
me
as
if
only
in
the
desert
there
is
freedom
for
the
body
and
only
in
truth
there
is
freedom
for
the
she
stopped
drew
a
long
breath
and
added
you
must
forgive
me
i
have
worried
you
i
have
made
you
do
what
you
didn
t
want
to
do
and
then
i
have
attacked
you
it
is
show
me
the
garden
madame
he
said
in
a
very
low
voice
her
outburst
over
she
felt
a
slight
she
wondered
what
he
thought
of
her
and
became
aware
of
her
unconventionality
his
curious
and
persistent
reticence
made
her
frankness
the
more
marked
yet
the
painful
sensation
of
oppression
and
exasperation
had
passed
away
from
her
and
she
no
longer
thought
of
his
personality
as
destructive
in
obedience
to
his
last
words
she
walked
on
and
he
kept
heavily
beside
her
till
they
were
in
the
deep
shadows
of
the
trees
and
the
spell
of
the
garden
began
to
return
upon
her
banishing
the
thought
of
self
listen
she
said
presently
larbi
s
flute
was
very
near
he
is
always
playing
she
whispered
who
is
he
one
of
the
gardeners
but
he
scarcely
ever
works
he
is
perpetually
in
love
that
is
why
he
is
that
a
then
androvsky
asked
yes
do
you
think
it
sounds
like
one
how
should
i
know
madame
he
stood
looking
in
the
direction
from
which
the
music
came
and
now
it
seemed
to
hold
him
fascinated
after
his
question
which
sounded
to
her
almost
childlike
and
which
she
did
not
answer
domini
glanced
at
his
attentive
face
to
which
the
green
shadows
lent
a
dimness
that
was
mysterious
at
his
tall
figure
which
always
suggested
to
her
both
weariness
and
strength
and
remembered
the
passionate
romance
to
whose
existence
she
awoke
when
she
first
heard
larbi
s
flute
it
was
as
if
a
shutter
which
had
closed
a
window
in
the
house
of
life
had
been
suddenly
drawn
away
giving
to
her
eyes
the
horizon
of
a
new
world
was
that
shutter
now
drawn
back
for
him
no
doubt
the
supposition
was
absurd
men
of
his
emotional
and
virile
type
have
travelled
far
in
that
world
to
her
mysterious
ere
they
reach
his
length
of
years
what
was
extraordinary
to
her
in
the
thought
of
it
alone
was
doubtless
quite
ordinary
to
him
translated
into
act
not
ignorant
she
was
nevertheless
a
perfectly
innocent
woman
but
her
knowledge
told
her
that
no
man
of
androvsky
s
strength
power
and
passion
is
innocent
at
androvsky
s
age
yet
his
last
question
was
very
deceptive
it
had
sounded
absolutely
natural
and
might
have
come
from
a
boy
s
pure
lips
again
he
made
her
wonder
there
was
a
garden
bench
close
to
where
they
were
standing
if
you
like
to
listen
for
a
moment
we
might
sit
down
she
said
he
started
yes
thank
when
they
were
sitting
side
by
side
closely
guarded
by
the
gigantic
fig
and
chestnut
trees
which
grew
in
this
part
of
the
garden
he
added
whom
does
he
love
no
doubt
one
of
those
native
women
whom
you
consider
utterly
without
attraction
she
answered
with
a
faint
touch
of
malice
which
made
him
redden
but
you
come
here
every
day
he
said
i
yes
has
he
ever
seen
you
larbi
often
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
he
did
not
reply
odd
and
disconnected
as
larbi
s
melodies
were
they
created
an
atmosphere
of
wild
tenderness
spontaneously
they
bubbled
up
out
of
the
heart
of
the
eastern
world
and
when
the
player
was
invisible
as
now
suggested
an
ebon
faun
couched
in
hot
sand
at
the
foot
of
a
palm
tree
and
making
music
to
listening
sunbeams
and
amorous
spirits
of
the
waste
do
you
like
it
she
said
presently
in
an
under
voice
yes
madame
and
you
i
love
it
but
not
as
i
love
the
song
of
the
freed
negroes
that
is
a
song
of
all
the
secrets
of
humanity
and
of
the
desert
too
and
it
does
not
try
to
tell
them
it
only
says
that
they
exist
and
that
god
knows
them
but
i
remember
you
do
not
like
that
madame
he
answered
slowly
and
as
if
he
were
choosing
his
words
i
see
that
you
understood
the
song
did
move
me
though
i
said
not
but
no
i
do
not
like
do
you
care
to
tell
me
why
such
a
song
as
that
seems
to
me
an
it
is
like
an
intrusion
there
are
things
that
should
be
let
alone
there
are
dark
places
that
should
be
left
you
mean
that
all
human
beings
hold
within
them
secrets
and
that
no
allusion
even
should
ever
be
made
to
those
secrets
i
after
a
pause
he
said
anxiously
she
thought
am
i
right
madame
or
is
my
thought
ridiculous
he
asked
it
so
simply
that
she
felt
touched
i
m
sure
you
could
never
be
ridiculous
she
said
quickly
and
perhaps
you
are
right
i
don
t
know
that
song
makes
me
think
and
feel
and
so
i
love
it
perhaps
if
you
heard
it
alone
then
i
should
hate
it
he
interposed
his
voice
was
like
an
uncontrolled
inner
voice
speaking
and
not
thought
and
feeling
she
began
but
he
interrupted
her
they
make
all
the
misery
that
exists
in
the
and
all
the
do
they
they
then
you
want
to
think
deeply
to
feel
deeply
yes
i
would
rather
be
the
central
figure
of
a
than
die
without
having
felt
to
the
uttermost
even
if
it
were
sorrow
my
whole
nature
revolts
against
the
idea
of
being
able
to
feel
little
or
nothing
really
it
seems
to
me
that
when
we
begin
to
feel
acutely
we
begin
to
grow
like
the
palm
tree
rising
towards
the
african
i
do
not
think
you
have
ever
been
very
unhappy
he
said
the
sound
of
his
voice
as
he
said
it
made
her
suddenly
feel
as
if
it
were
true
as
if
she
had
never
been
utterly
unhappy
yet
she
had
never
been
really
happy
africa
had
taught
her
that
perhaps
not
she
answered
but
some
day
she
stopped
yes
madame
could
one
stay
long
in
such
a
world
as
this
and
not
be
either
intensely
happy
or
intensely
unhappy
i
don
t
feel
as
if
it
would
be
possible
fierceness
and
fire
beat
upon
one
day
after
day
and
one
must
learn
to
feel
as
she
spoke
a
sensation
of
doubt
almost
of
apprehension
came
to
her
she
was
overtaken
by
a
terror
of
the
desert
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
right
that
it
were
better
never
to
be
the
prey
of
any
deep
emotion
if
one
does
not
wish
to
feel
one
should
never
come
to
such
a
place
as
this
she
added
and
she
longed
to
ask
him
why
he
was
here
he
a
man
whose
philosophy
told
him
to
avoid
the
heights
and
depths
to
shun
the
ardours
of
nature
and
of
life
or
having
come
one
should
leave
a
sensation
of
lurking
danger
increased
upon
her
bringing
with
it
the
thought
of
flight
one
can
always
do
that
she
said
looking
at
him
she
saw
fear
in
his
eyes
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
not
fear
of
peril
but
fear
of
flight
so
strongly
was
this
idea
borne
in
upon
her
that
she
bluntly
exclaimed
unless
it
is
one
s
nature
to
face
things
never
to
turn
one
s
back
is
it
yours
monsieur
androvsky
fear
could
never
drive
me
to
leave
he
answered
sometimes
i
think
that
the
only
virtue
in
us
is
courage
she
said
that
it
includes
all
the
others
i
believe
i
could
forgive
everything
where
i
found
absolute
androvsky
s
eyes
were
lit
up
as
if
by
a
flicker
of
inward
fire
you
might
create
the
virtue
you
love
he
said
hoarsely
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
did
he
mean
that
she
might
create
it
in
him
perhaps
she
would
have
asked
or
perhaps
he
would
have
told
her
but
at
that
moment
something
happened
larbi
stopped
playing
in
the
last
few
minutes
they
had
both
forgotten
that
he
was
playing
but
when
he
ceased
the
garden
changed
something
was
withdrawn
in
which
without
knowing
it
they
had
been
protecting
themselves
and
when
the
music
faded
their
armour
dropped
away
from
them
with
the
complete
silence
came
an
altered
atmosphere
the
tenderness
of
mysticism
instead
of
the
tenderness
of
a
wild
humanity
the
love
of
man
seemed
to
depart
out
of
the
garden
and
another
love
to
enter
it
as
when
god
walked
under
the
trees
in
the
cool
of
the
day
and
they
sat
quite
still
as
if
a
common
impulse
muted
their
lips
in
the
long
silence
that
followed
domini
thought
of
her
mirage
of
the
palm
tree
growing
towards
the
african
sun
feeling
growing
in
the
heart
of
a
human
being
but
was
it
a
worthy
image
for
the
palm
tree
rises
high
it
soars
into
the
air
but
presently
it
ceases
to
grow
there
is
nothing
infinite
in
its
growth
and
the
long
hot
years
pass
away
and
there
it
stands
never
nearer
to
the
infinite
gold
of
the
sun
but
in
the
intense
feeling
of
a
man
or
woman
is
there
not
infinitude
is
there
not
a
movement
that
is
ceaseless
till
death
comes
to
destroy
or
to
translate
that
was
what
she
was
thinking
in
the
silence
of
the
garden
and
androvsky
he
sat
beside
her
with
his
head
bent
his
hands
hanging
between
his
knees
his
eyes
gazing
before
him
at
the
ordered
tangle
of
the
great
trees
his
lips
were
slightly
parted
and
on
his
face
there
was
an
expression
as
of
emotional
peace
as
if
the
soul
of
the
man
were
feeling
deeply
in
calm
the
restlessness
the
violence
that
had
made
his
demeanour
so
embarrassing
during
and
after
the
had
vanished
he
was
a
different
man
and
presently
noticing
it
feeling
his
sensitive
serenity
domini
seemed
to
see
the
great
mother
at
work
about
this
child
of
hers
nature
at
her
tender
task
of
pacification
the
shared
silence
became
to
her
like
a
song
of
thanksgiving
in
which
all
the
green
things
of
the
garden
joined
and
beyond
them
the
desert
lay
listening
the
garden
of
allah
attentive
to
the
voices
of
man
s
garden
she
could
hardly
believe
that
but
a
few
minutes
before
she
had
been
full
of
irritation
and
bitterness
not
free
even
from
a
touch
of
pride
that
was
almost
petty
but
when
she
remembered
that
it
was
so
she
realised
the
abysses
and
the
heights
of
which
the
heart
is
mingled
and
an
intense
desire
came
to
her
to
be
always
upon
the
heights
of
her
own
heart
for
there
only
was
the
light
of
happiness
never
could
she
know
joy
if
she
forswore
nobility
never
could
she
be
at
peace
with
the
love
within
her
love
of
something
that
was
not
self
of
something
that
seemed
vaguer
than
god
as
if
it
had
entered
into
god
and
made
him
love
unless
she
mounted
upwards
during
her
little
span
of
life
again
as
before
in
this
land
in
the
first
sunset
on
the
tower
on
the
minaret
of
the
mosque
of
nature
spoke
to
her
intimate
words
of
inspiration
laid
upon
her
the
hands
of
healing
giving
her
powers
she
surely
had
not
known
or
conceived
of
till
now
and
the
passion
that
is
the
chiefest
grace
of
goodness
making
it
the
fire
that
purifies
as
it
is
the
little
sister
of
the
poor
that
tends
the
suffering
the
hungry
the
groping
stirred
within
her
like
the
child
not
yet
born
but
whose
destiny
is
with
the
angels
and
she
longed
to
make
some
great
offering
at
the
altar
on
whose
lowest
step
she
stood
and
she
was
filled
for
the
first
time
consciously
with
woman
s
sacred
desire
for
sacrifice
a
soft
step
on
the
sand
broke
the
silence
and
scattered
her
aspirations
count
anteoni
was
coming
towards
them
between
the
trees
the
light
of
happiness
was
still
upon
his
face
and
made
him
look
much
younger
than
usual
his
whole
bearing
in
its
elasticity
and
buoyant
courage
was
full
of
anticipation
as
he
came
up
to
them
he
said
to
domini
do
you
remember
chiding
me
i
she
said
for
what
androvsky
sat
up
and
the
expression
of
serenity
passed
away
from
his
face
for
never
galloping
away
into
the
oh
yes
i
do
well
i
am
going
to
obey
you
i
am
going
to
make
a
into
the
desert
three
hundred
kilometers
on
horseback
i
start
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
new
interest
he
saw
it
and
laughed
almost
like
a
boy
ah
your
contempt
for
me
is
dying
how
can
you
speak
of
contempt
but
you
were
full
of
he
turned
to
androvsky
miss
enfilden
thought
i
could
not
sit
a
horse
monsieur
unlike
you
forgive
me
for
saying
that
you
are
almost
more
than
the
arabs
themselves
i
saw
you
the
other
day
set
your
stallion
at
the
bank
of
the
river
bed
i
did
not
think
any
horse
could
have
done
it
but
you
knew
i
did
not
know
at
all
said
androvsky
i
had
not
ridden
for
over
twenty
years
until
that
he
spoke
with
a
blunt
determination
which
made
domini
remember
their
recent
conversation
on
dio
mio
said
the
count
slowly
and
looking
at
him
with
undisguised
wonder
you
must
have
a
will
and
a
frame
of
i
am
pretty
he
spoke
rather
roughly
since
the
count
had
joined
them
domini
noticed
that
androvsky
had
become
a
different
man
once
more
he
was
on
the
defensive
the
count
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
perhaps
he
was
too
radiant
i
hope
i
shall
endure
as
well
as
you
monsieur
he
said
i
go
to
to
visit
sidi
el
hadj
aissa
one
of
the
mightiest
marabouts
in
the
sahara
in
your
church
he
added
turning
again
to
domini
he
would
be
a
powerful
she
noticed
the
evidently
the
count
was
not
a
professing
catholic
doubtless
like
many
modern
italians
he
was
a
in
matters
of
religion
i
am
afraid
i
have
never
heard
of
him
she
said
in
which
direction
does
lie
to
go
there
one
takes
the
caravan
route
that
the
natives
call
the
route
to
an
eager
look
came
into
her
face
my
road
she
said
yours
the
one
i
shall
travel
on
you
remember
monsieur
androvsky
yes
let
me
into
your
secret
said
the
count
laughingly
yet
with
interest
too
it
is
no
secret
it
is
only
that
i
love
that
route
it
fascinates
me
and
i
mean
some
day
to
make
a
desert
journey
along
what
a
pity
that
we
can
not
join
forces
the
count
said
i
should
feel
it
an
honour
to
show
the
desert
to
one
who
has
the
reverence
for
it
the
understanding
of
its
spell
that
you
he
spoke
earnestly
paused
and
then
added
but
i
know
well
what
you
are
what
is
that
that
you
will
go
to
the
desert
alone
you
are
right
it
is
the
only
way
at
any
rate
the
first
time
i
went
like
that
many
years
she
said
nothing
in
assent
and
androvsky
got
up
from
the
bench
i
must
go
already
but
have
you
seen
the
garden
it
is
wonderful
monsieur
thank
but
let
me
see
you
to
the
gate
on
fridays
he
was
turning
to
domini
when
she
got
up
too
don
t
you
distribute
alms
on
fridays
she
said
how
should
you
know
it
i
have
heard
all
about
you
but
is
this
the
hour
let
me
see
the
and
we
will
speed
monsieur
androvsky
on
his
way
at
the
same
she
noticed
that
there
was
no
question
in
his
mind
of
her
going
with
androvsky
did
she
mean
to
go
with
him
she
had
not
decided
yet
they
walked
towards
the
gate
and
were
soon
on
the
great
sweep
of
sand
before
the
villa
a
murmur
of
many
voices
was
audible
outside
in
the
desert
nasal
exclamations
loud
guttural
cries
that
sounded
angry
the
twittering
of
flutes
and
the
snarl
of
camels
do
you
hear
my
pensioners
said
the
count
they
are
always
there
was
the
noise
of
a
tomtom
and
of
a
whining
shriek
that
is
old
bel
cassem
s
announcement
of
his
presence
he
has
been
living
on
me
for
years
the
old
ruffian
ever
since
his
right
eye
was
gouged
out
by
his
rival
in
the
affections
of
the
marechale
of
the
smain
he
blew
his
silver
whistle
instantly
smain
came
out
of
the
villa
carrying
a
the
count
took
it
and
weighed
it
in
his
hand
looking
at
domini
with
the
joyous
expression
still
upon
his
face
have
you
ever
made
a
he
said
that
tells
me
something
well
i
wish
to
make
a
to
the
what
has
it
done
for
you
who
knows
who
knows
he
laughed
aloud
almost
like
a
boy
androvsky
glanced
at
him
with
a
sort
of
wondering
envy
and
i
want
you
to
share
in
my
little
distribution
he
added
and
you
monsieur
if
you
don
t
mind
there
are
moments
when
open
the
gate
smain
his
ardour
was
infectious
and
domini
felt
stirred
by
it
to
a
sudden
sense
of
the
joy
of
life
she
looked
at
androvsky
to
include
him
in
the
rigour
of
gaiety
which
swept
from
the
count
to
her
and
found
him
staring
apprehensively
at
the
count
who
was
now
loosening
the
string
of
the
bag
smain
had
reached
the
gate
he
lifted
the
bar
of
wood
and
opened
it
instantly
a
crowd
of
dark
faces
and
turbaned
heads
were
thrust
through
the
tall
aperture
a
multitude
of
dusky
hands
fluttered
frantically
and
the
cry
of
eager
voices
saluting
begging
calling
down
blessings
relating
troubles
shrieking
wants
proclaiming
virtues
and
necessities
rose
into
an
almost
deafening
uproar
but
not
a
foot
was
lifted
over
the
lintel
to
press
the
sunlit
sand
the
count
s
pensioners
might
be
clamorous
but
they
knew
what
they
might
not
do
as
he
saw
them
the
wrinkles
in
his
face
deepened
and
his
fingers
quickened
to
achieve
their
purpose
my
pensioners
are
very
hungry
and
as
you
see
they
don
t
mind
saying
so
hark
at
bel
cassem
the
tomtom
and
the
shriek
that
went
with
it
made
it
a
fierce
crescendo
that
means
he
is
starving
the
old
hypocrite
aren
t
they
like
the
wolves
in
your
russia
monsieur
but
we
must
feed
them
we
mustn
t
let
them
devour
our
that
s
it
he
threw
the
string
on
to
the
sand
plunged
his
hand
into
the
bag
and
brought
it
out
full
of
copper
coins
the
mouths
opened
wider
the
hands
waved
more
frantically
and
all
the
dark
eyes
gleamed
with
the
light
of
greed
will
you
help
me
he
said
to
domini
of
course
what
fun
her
eyes
were
gleaming
too
but
with
the
dancing
fires
of
a
gay
impulse
of
generosity
which
made
her
wish
that
the
bag
contained
her
money
he
filled
her
hands
with
coins
choose
whom
you
will
and
now
monsieur
for
the
moment
he
was
so
boyishly
concentrated
on
the
immediate
present
that
he
had
ceased
to
observe
whether
the
whim
of
others
jumped
with
his
own
otherwise
he
must
have
been
struck
by
androvsky
s
marked
discomfort
which
indeed
almost
amounted
to
agitation
the
sight
of
the
throng
of
arabs
at
the
gateway
the
clamour
of
their
voices
evidently
roused
within
him
something
akin
to
fear
he
looked
at
them
with
distaste
and
had
drawn
back
several
steps
upon
the
sand
and
now
as
the
count
held
out
to
him
a
hand
filled
with
money
he
made
no
motion
to
take
it
and
half
turned
as
if
he
thought
of
retreating
into
the
recesses
of
the
garden
here
monsieur
here
exclaimed
the
count
with
his
eyes
on
the
crowd
towards
which
domini
was
walking
with
a
sort
of
mischievous
slowness
to
whet
those
appetites
already
so
voracious
androvsky
set
his
teeth
and
took
the
money
dropping
one
or
two
pieces
on
the
ground
for
a
moment
the
count
seemed
doubtful
of
his
guest
s
participation
in
his
own
lively
mood
is
this
boring
you
he
asked
because
if
so
no
no
monsieur
not
at
all
what
am

to
do
those
hands
will
tell
the
clamour
grew
more
exigent
and
when
you
want
more
come
to
me
then
he
called
out
in
arabic
gently
gently
as
the
vehement
scuffling
seemed
about
to
degenerate
into
actual
fighting
at
domini
s
approach
and
hurried
forward
followed
more
slowly
by
androvsky
smain
from
whose
velvety
eyes
the
dreams
were
not
banished
by
the
uproar
stood
languidly
by
the
porter
s
tent
gazing
at
androvsky
something
in
the
demeanour
of
the
new
visitor
seemed
to
attract
him
domini
meanwhile
had
reached
the
gateway
gently
with
a
capricious
deftness
and
all
a
woman
s
passion
for
personal
choice
she
dropped
the
bits
of
money
into
the
hands
belonging
to
the
faces
that
attracted
her
disregarding
the
bellowings
of
those
passed
over
the
light
from
all
these
gleaming
eyes
made
her
feel
warm
the
clamour
that
poured
from
these
brown
throats
excited
her
when
her
fingers
were
empty
she
touched
the
count
s
arm
eagerly

ecco
he
held
out
to
her
the
bag
she
plunged
her
hands
into
it
and
came
nearer
to
the
gate
both
hands
full
of
money
and
held
high
above
her
head
the
arabs
leapt
up
at
her
like
dogs
at
a
bone
and
for
a
moment
she
waited
laughing
with
all
her
heart
then
she
made
a
movement
to
throw
the
money
over
the
heads
of
the
near
ones
to
the
unfortunates
who
were
dancing
and
shrieking
on
the
outskirts
of
the
mob
but
suddenly
her
hands
dropped
and
she
uttered
a
startled
exclamation
the
of
the
red
bazaar
slipping
like
a
reptile
under
the
waving
arms
and
between
the
furious
bodies
of
the
beggars
stood
up
before
her
with
a
smile
on
his
wounded
face
stretched
out
to
her
his
emaciated
hands
with
a
fawning
yet
half
satirical
gesture
of
desire
chapter
xii
the
money
dropped
from
domini
s
fingers
and
rolled
upon
the
sand
at
the
diviner
s
feet
but
though
he
had
surely
come
to
ask
for
alms
he
took
no
heed
of
it
while
the
arabs
round
him
fell
upon
their
knees
and
fought
like
animals
for
the
plunder
he
stood
gaping
at
domini
the
smile
still
flickered
about
his
lips
his
hand
was
still
stretched
out
instinctively
she
had
moved
backwards
something
that
was
like
a
thrill
of
fear
mental
not
physical
went
through
her
but
she
kept
her
eyes
steadily
on
his
as
if
despite
the
fear
she
fought
against
him
the
contest
of
the
beggars
had
become
so
passionate
that
count
anteoni
s
commands
were
forgotten
urged
by
the
pressure
from
behind
those
in
the
front
scrambled
or
fell
over
the
sacred
threshold
the
garden
was
invaded
by
a
shrieking
mob
smain
ran
forward
and
the
autocrat
that
dwelt
in
the
count
side
by
side
with
the
benefactor
suddenly
emerged
he
blew
his
whistle
four
times
at
each
call
a
stalwart
arab
appeared
shut
the
gate
he
commanded
sternly
the
attendants
furiously
repulsed
the
mob
using
their
fists
and
feet
without
mercy
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
sand
was
cleared
and
smain
had
his
hand
upon
the
door
to
shut
it
but
the
diviner
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
and
in
a
fawning
yet
imperious
voice
called
out
something
to
the
count
the
count
turned
to
domini
this
is
an
interesting
fellow
would
you
like
to
know
him
her
mind
said
no
yet
her
body
assented
for
she
bowed
her
head
the
count
beckoned
the
diviner
stepped
stealthily
on
to
the
sand
with
an
air
of
subtle
triumph
and
smain
swung
forward
the
great
leaf
of
palm
wood
wait
the
count
cried
as
if
suddenly
recollecting
something
where
is
monsieur
androvsky
isn
t
he
domini
glanced
round
i
don
t
he
went
quickly
to
the
door
and
looked
out
the
arabs
silent
now
and
respectful
crowded
about
him
salaaming
he
smiled
at
them
kindly
and
spoke
to
one
or
two
they
answered
gravely
an
old
man
with
one
eye
lifted
his
hand
in
which
was
a
tomtom
of
stretched
goatskin
and
pointed
towards
the
oasis
rapidly
moving
his
toothless
jaws
the
count
stepped
back
into
the
garden
dismissed
his
pensioners
with
a
masterful
wave
of
the
hand
and
himself
shut
the
door
monsieur
androvsky
has
gone
without
saying
he
said
again
domini
felt
ashamed
for
androvsky
i
don
t
think
he
likes
my
pensioners
the
count
added
in
amused
voice
or
i
am
sure
domini
began
but
he
stopped
her
miss
enfilden
in
a
world
of
lies
i
look
to
you
for
his
manner
chafed
her
but
his
voice
had
a
ring
of
earnestness
she
said
nothing
all
this
time
the
diviner
was
standing
on
the
sand
still
smiling
but
with
downcast
eyes
his
thin
body
looked
satirical
and
domini
felt
a
strong
aversion
from
him
yet
a
strong
interest
in
him
too
something
in
his
appearance
and
manner
suggested
power
and
mystery
as
well
as
cunning
the
count
said
some
words
to
him
in
arabic
and
at
once
he
walked
forward
and
disappeared
among
the
trees
going
so
silently
and
smoothly
that
she
seemed
to
watch
a
panther
gliding
into
the
depths
of
a
jungle
where
its
prey
lay
hid
she
looked
at
the
count
interrogatively
he
will
wait
in
the
where
we
first
met
what
for
for
us
if
you
tell
me
about
him
i
have
seen
him
twice
he
followed
me
with
a
bag
of
he
is
a
desert
man
i
don
t
know
his
tribe
but
before
he
settled
here
he
was
a
nomad
one
of
the
wanderers
who
dwell
in
tents
a
man
of
the
sand
as
much
of
the
sand
as
a
viper
or
a
scorpion
one
would
suppose
such
beings
were
bred
by
the
marriage
of
the
the
sand
tells
him
he
says
do
you
believe
it
would
you
like
to
test
it
how
by
coming
with
me
to
the
she
hesitated
obviously
mind
he
added
i
do
not
press
it
a
word
from
me
and
he
is
gone
but
you
are
fearless
and
you
have
spoken
already
will
speak
much
more
intimately
in
the
future
with
the
desert
how
do
you
know
that
the
much
more
intimately
i
do
not
know
it
but
which
is
much
more
i
feel
she
was
silent
looking
towards
the
trees
where
the
diviner
had
disappeared
count
anteoni
s
boyish
merriment
had
faded
away
he
looked
grave
almost
sad
i
am
not
afraid
she
said
at
last
no
but
i
will
confess
it
there
is
something
horrible
about
that
man
to
me
i
felt
it
the
first
time
i
saw
him
his
eyes
are
too
intelligent
they
look
diseased
with
let
me
send
him
away
smain
but
she
stopped
him
directly
he
made
the
suggestion
she
felt
that
she
must
know
more
of
this
man
no
let
us
go
to
the
very
well
go
smain
smain
went
into
the
little
tent
by
the
gate
sat
down
on
his
haunches
and
began
to
smell
at
a
sprig
of
orange
blossoms
domini
and
the
count
walked
into
the
darkness
of
the
trees
what
is
his
name
she
asked
she
repeated
the
word
slowly
there
was
a
reluctant
and
yet
fascinated
sound
in
her
voice
there
is
melody
in
the
name
he
said
yes
has
he
has
he
ever
looked
in
the
sand
for
you
once
a
long
time
may
i
dare
i
ask
if
he
found
truth
there
he
found
nothing
for
all
the
years
that
have
passed
since
nothing
there
was
a
sound
of
relief
in
her
voice
for
those
she
glanced
at
him
and
saw
that
once
again
his
face
had
lit
up
into
ardour
he
found
what
is
still
to
come
she
said
and
he
repeated
he
found
what
is
still
to
then
they
walked
on
in
silence
till
they
saw
the
purple
blossoms
of
the
bougainvillea
clinging
to
the
white
walls
of
the
domini
stopped
on
the
narrow
path
is
he
in
there
she
asked
almost
in
a
whisper
no
larbi
was
playing
the
first
day
i
came
i
wish
he
was
playing
the
silence
seemed
to
her
unnaturally
intense
even
his
love
must
have
she
went
on
a
step
or
two
till
but
still
from
a
distance
she
could
look
over
the
low
plaster
wall
beneath
the
nearest
window
space
into
the
little
room
yes
there
he
is
she
whispered
the
diviner
was
crouching
on
the
floor
with
his
back
towards
them
and
his
head
bent
down
only
his
shoulders
could
be
seen
covered
with
a
white
gandoura
they
moved
perpetually
but
slightly
what
is
he
doing
speaking
with
his
his
ancestor
the
sand
aloui
he
called
softly
the
figure
rose
without
sound
and
instantly
and
the
face
of
the
diviner
smiled
at
them
through
the
purple
flowers
again
domini
had
the
sensation
that
her
body
was
a
glass
box
in
which
her
thoughts
feelings
and
desires
were
ranged
for
this
man
s
inspection
but
she
walked
resolutely
through
the
narrow
doorway
and
sat
down
on
one
of
the
divans
count
anteoni
followed
she
now
saw
that
in
the
centre
of
the
room
on
the
ground
there
was
a
symmetrical
pyramid
of
sand
and
that
the
diviner
was
gently
folding
together
a
bag
in
his
long
and
flexible
fingers
you
see
said
the
count
she
nodded
without
speaking
the
little
sand
heap
held
her
eyes
she
strove
to
think
it
absurd
and
the
man
who
had
shaken
it
out
a
charlatan
of
the
desert
but
she
was
really
gripped
by
an
odd
feeling
of
awe
as
if
she
were
secretly
expectant
of
some
magical
demonstration
the
diviner
squatted
down
once
more
on
his
haunches
stretched
out
his
fingers
above
the
sand
heap
looked
at
her
and
smiled
la
vie
de
madame
i
see
it
in
the
sable
la
vie
de
madame
dans
le
grand
desert
du
his
eyes
seemed
to
rout
out
the
secrets
from
every
corner
of
her
being
and
to
scatter
them
upon
the
ground
as
the
sand
was
scattered
dans
le
grand
desert
du
sahara
count
anteoni
repeated
as
if
he
loved
the
music
of
the
words
then
there
is
a
desert
life
for
madame
the
diviner
dropped
his
fingers
on
to
the
pyramid
lightly
pressing
the
sand
down
and
outward
he
no
longer
looked
at
domini
the
searching
and
the
satire
slipped
away
from
his
eyes
and
body
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
two
watchers
and
to
be
concentrated
upon
the
grains
of
sand
domini
noticed
that
the
tortured
expression
which
had
come
into
his
face
when
she
met
him
in
the
street
and
he
stared
into
the
bag
had
returned
to
it
after
pressing
down
the
sand
he
spread
the
bag
which
had
held
it
at
domini
s
feet
and
deftly
transferred
the
sand
to
it
scattering
the
grains
loosely
over
the
sacking
in
a
sort
of
pattern
then
bending
closely
over
them
he
stared
at
them
in
silence
for
a
long
time
his
face
was
set
like
stone
his
emaciated
hands
stretched
out
rested
above
the
grains
like
carven
things
his
body
seemed
entirely
breathless
in
its
absolute
immobility
the
count
stood
in
the
doorway
still
as
he
was
surrounded
by
the
motionless
purple
flowers
beyond
in
their
serried
ranks
stood
the
motionless
trees
no
incense
was
burning
in
the
little
brazier
this
cloistered
world
seemed
a
low
murmur
at
last
broke
the
silence
it
came
from
the
diviner
he
began
to
talk
rapidly
but
as
if
to
himself
and
as
he
talked
he
moved
again
broke
up
with
his
fingers
the
patterns
in
the
sand
formed
fresh
ones
spirals
circles
lines
series
of
mounting
dots
that
reminded
domini
of
spray
flung
by
a
fountain
curves
squares
and
oblongs
so
swiftly
was
it
done
and
undone
that
the
sand
seemed
to
be
endowed
with
life
to
be
explaining
itself
in
these
patterns
to
be
presenting
deliberate
glimpses
of
hitherto
hidden
truths
and
always
the
voice
went
on
and
the
eyes
were
downcast
and
the
body
save
for
the
moving
hands
and
arms
was
absolutely
motionless
domini
looked
over
the
diviner
to
count
anteoni
who
came
gently
forward
and
sat
down
bending
his
head
to
listen
to
the
voice
is
it
arabic
she
whispered
he
nodded
can
you
understand
it
not
yet
presently
it
will
get
slower
clearer
he
always
begins
like
translate
it
for
exactly
as
it
is
exactly
as
it
whatever
it
may
be
whatever
it
may
he
glanced
at
the
tortured
face
of
the
diviner
and
looked
grave
remember
you
have
said
i
am
fearless
she
said
he
answered
whatever
it
is
you
shall
know
then
they
were
silent
again
gradually
the
diviner
s
voice
grew
clearer
the
pace
of
its
words
less
rapid
but
always
it
sounded
mysterious
and
inward
less
like
the
voice
of
a
man
than
the
distant
voice
of
a
secret
i
can
hear
now
whispered
the
count
what
is
he
saying
he
is
speaking
about
the
yes
he
sees
a
great
storm
wait
a
moment
the
voice
spoke
for
some
seconds
and
ceased
and
once
again
the
diviner
remained
absolutely
motionless
with
his
hands
extended
above
the
grains
like
carven
things
he
sees
a
great
one
of
the
most
terrible
that
has
ever
burst
over
the
sahara
everything
is
blotted
out
the
desert
vanishes
is
hidden
it
is
day
yet
there
is
a
darkness
like
night
in
this
darkness
he
sees
a
train
of
camels
waiting
by
a
a
mosque
no
a
church
in
the
church
there
is
a
sound
of
music
the
roar
of
the
wind
the
roar
of
the
camels
mingles
with
the
chanting
and
drowns
it
he
can
not
hear
it
any
more
it
is
as
if
the
desert
is
angry
and
wishes
to
kill
the
music
in
the
church
your
life
is
my
life
your
real
life
he
says
that
now
you
are
fully
born
that
till
now
there
has
been
a
veil
around
your
soul
like
the
veil
of
the
womb
around
a
he
says
that
there
was
a
sound
of
deep
emotion
in
her
voice
that
is
all
the
roar
of
the
wind
from
the
desert
has
silenced
the
music
in
the
church
and
all
is
the
diviner
moved
again
and
formed
fresh
patterns
in
the
sand
with
feverish
rapidity
and
again
began
to
speak
swiftly
he
sees
the
train
of
camels
that
waited
by
the
church
starting
on
a
desert
journey
the
storm
has
not
abated
they
pass
through
the
oasis
into
the
desert
he
sees
them
going
towards
the
domini
leaned
forward
on
the
divan
looking
at
count
anteoni
above
the
bent
body
of
the
diviner
by
what
route
she
whispered
by
the
route
which
the
natives
call
the
road
to
but
it
is
my
journey
upon
one
of
the
camels
in
a
palanquin
such
as
the
great
sheikhs
use
to
carry
their
women
there
are
two
people
protected
against
the
storm
by
curtains
they
are
silent
listening
to
the
roaring
of
the
wind
one
of
them
is
two
people
two
but
who
is
the
other
he
can
not
see
it
is
as
if
the
blackness
of
the
storm
were
deeper
round
about
the
other
and
hid
the
other
from
him
the
caravan
passes
on
and
is
lost
in
the
desolation
and
the
she
said
nothing
but
looked
down
at
the
thin
body
of
the
diviner
crouched
close
to
her
knees
was
this
face
the
face
of
a
prophet
did
this
skin
and
bone
envelop
the
soul
of
a
seer
she
no
longer
wished
that
larbi
was
playing
upon
his
flute
or
felt
the
silence
to
be
unnatural
for
this
man
had
filled
it
with
the
roar
of
the
desert
wind
and
in
the
wind
there
struggled
and
was
finally
lost
the
sound
of
voices
of
her
faith
chanting
what
the
wind
was
too
strong
the
voices
were
too
faint
she
could
not
hear
once
more
the
diviner
stirred
for
some
minutes
his
fingers
were
busy
in
the
sand
but
now
they
moved
more
slowly
and
no
words
came
from
his
lips
domini
and
the
count
bent
low
to
watch
what
he
was
doing
the
look
of
torture
upon
his
face
increased
it
was
terrible
and
made
upon
domini
an
indelible
impression
for
she
could
not
help
connecting
it
with
his
vision
of
her
future
and
it
suggested
to
her
formless
phantoms
of
despair
she
looked
into
the
sand
as
if
she
too
would
be
able
to
see
what
he
saw
and
had
not
told
looked
till
she
began
to
feel
almost
hypnotised
the
diviner
s
hands
trembled
now
as
they
made
the
patterns
and
his
breast
heaved
under
his
white
robe
presently
he
traced
in
the
sand
a
triangle
and
began
to
speak
the
count
bent
down
till
his
ear
was
almost
at
the
diviner
s
lips
and
domini
held
her
breath
that
caravan
lost
in
the
desolation
of
the
desert
in
the
storm
and
the
darkness
where
was
it
what
had
been
its
fate
sweat
ran
down
over
the
diviner
s
face
and
dropped
upon
his
robe
upon
his
hands
upon
the
sand
making
dark
spots
and
the
voice
whispered
on
huskily
till
she
was
in
a
fever
of
impatience
she
saw
upon
the
face
of
the
count
the
diviner
s
tortured
look
reflected
was
it
not
also
on
her
face
a
link
surely
bound
them
all
together
in
this
tiny
room
close
circled
by
the
tall
trees
and
the
intense
silence
she
looked
at
the
triangle
in
the
sand
it
was
very
distinct
more
distinct
than
the
other
patterns
had
been
what
did
it
represent
she
searched
her
mind
thinking
of
the
desert
of
her
life
there
of
man
s
life
in
the
desert
was
it
not
she
saw
it
as
a
tent
as
her
tent
pitched
somewhere
in
the
waste
far
from
the
habitations
of
men
now
the
trembling
hands
were
still
the
voice
was
still
but
the
sweat
did
not
cease
from
dropping
down
upon
the
sand
tell
me
she
murmured
to
the
count
he
obeyed
seeming
now
to
speak
with
an
effort
it
is
far
away
in
the
desert
he
paused
yes
yes
very
far
away
in
a
sandy
place
there
are
immense
dunes
immense
white
dunes
of
sand
on
every
side
like
mountains
near
at
hand
there
is
a
gleam
of
many
fires
they
are
lit
in
the
of
a
desert
city
among
the
dunes
with
camels
picketed
behind
it
there
is
a
tent
she
pointed
to
the
triangle
traced
upon
the
sand
i
knew
it
she
whispered
it
is
my
he
sees
you
there
as
he
saw
you
in
the
palanquin
but
now
it
is
night
and
you
are
quite
alone
you
are
not
asleep
something
keeps
you
awake
you
are
excited
you
go
out
of
the
tent
upon
the
dunes
and
look
towards
the
fires
of
the
city
he
hears
the
jackals
howling
all
around
you
and
sees
the
skeletons
of
dead
camels
white
under
the
she
shuddered
in
spite
of
herself
there
is
something
tremendous
in
your
soul
he
says
it
is
as
if
all
the
date
palms
of
the
desert
bore
their
fruit
together
and
in
all
the
dry
places
where
men
and
camels
have
died
of
thirst
in
bygone
years
running
springs
burst
forth
and
as
if
the
sand
were
covered
with
millions
of
golden
flowers
big
as
the
flower
of
the
but
then
it
is
joy
it
must
be
joy
he
says
it
is
great
then
why
does
he
look
like
that
breathe
like
that
she
indicated
the
diviner
who
was
trembling
where
he
crouched
and
breathing
heavily
and
always
sweating
like
one
in
agony
there
is
more
said
the
count
slowly
tell
you
stand
alone
upon
the
dunes
and
you
look
towards
the
city
he
hears
the
tomtoms
beating
and
distant
cries
as
if
there
were
a
fantasia
then
he
sees
a
figure
among
the
dunes
coming
towards
who
is
it
she
asked
he
did
not
answer
but
she
did
not
wish
him
to
answer
she
had
spoken
without
meaning
to
speak
you
watch
this
figure
it
comes
to
you
walking
walking
heavily
that
s
what
he
says
the
dates
shrivel
on
the
palms
the
streams
dry
up
the
flowers
droop
and
die
in
the
sand
in
the
city
the
tomtoms
faint
away
and
the
red
fires
fade
away
all
is
dark
and
silent
and
then
he
sees
wait
domini
said
almost
sharply
he
sat
looking
at
her
she
pressed
her
hands
together
in
her
dark
face
with
its
heavy
eyebrows
and
strong
generous
mouth
a
contest
showed
a
struggle
between
some
quick
desire
and
some
more
sluggish
but
determined
reluctance
in
a
moment
she
spoke
again
i
won
t
hear
anything
more
but
you
said
whatever
it
may
yes
but
i
won
t
hear
anything
she
spoke
very
quietly
with
determination
the
diviner
was
beginning
to
move
his
hands
again
to
make
fresh
patterns
in
the
sand
to
speak
swiftly
once
more
shall
i
stop
him
then
would
you
mind
going
out
into
the
garden
i
will
join
you
in
a
moment
take
care
not
to
disturb
she
got
up
with
precaution
held
her
skirts
together
with
her
hands
and
slipped
softly
out
on
to
the
garden
path
for
a
moment
she
was
inclined
to
wait
there
to
look
back
and
see
what
was
happening
in
the
but
she
resisted
her
inclination
and
walked
on
slowly
till
she
reached
the
bench
where
she
had
sat
an
hour
before
with
androvsky
there
she
sat
down
and
waited
in
a
few
minutes
she
saw
the
count
coming
towards
her
alone
his
face
was
very
grave
but
lightened
with
a
slight
smile
when
he
saw
her
he
has
gone
she
asked
he
was
about
to
sit
beside
her
but
she
said
quickly
would
you
mind
going
back
to
the
jamelon
tree
where
we
sat
this
morning
was
it
only
oh
but
you
are
going
away
you
have
a
lot
to
do
probably
nothing
my
men
will
arrange
she
got
up
and
they
walked
in
silence
till
they
saw
once
more
the
immense
spaces
of
the
desert
bathed
in
the
afternoon
sun
as
domini
looked
at
them
again
she
knew
that
their
wonder
their
meaning
had
increased
for
her
the
steady
crescendo
that
was
beginning
almost
to
frighten
her
was
maintained
the
crescendo
of
the
voice
of
the
sahara
to
what
tremendous
demonstration
was
this
crescendo
tending
to
what
ultimate
glory
or
terror
she
felt
that
her
soul
was
as
yet
too
undeveloped
to
conceive
the
diviner
had
been
right
there
was
a
veil
around
it
like
the
veil
of
the
womb
that
hides
the
unborn
child
under
the
jamelon
tree
she
sat
down
once
more
may
i
light
a
cigar
the
count
asked
he
struck
a
match
lit
a
cigar
and
sat
down
on
her
left
by
the
garden
wall
tell
me
frankly
he
said
do
you
wish
to
talk
or
to
be
silent
i
wish
to
speak
to
i
am
sorry
now
i
asked
you
to
test
aloui
s
why
because
i
fear
they
made
an
unpleasant
impression
upon
that
was
not
why
i
made
you
stop
no
you
don
t
understand
me
i
was
not
afraid
i
can
only
say
that
but
i
can
t
give
you
my
reason
for
stopping
him
i
wished
to
tell
you
that
it
was
not
i
believe
i
know
that
you
are
fearless
he
said
with
an
unusual
warmth
you
are
sure
that
i
don
t
understand
you
remember
the
refrain
of
the
freed
negroes
song
ah
yes
those
black
fellows
but
i
know
something
of
you
miss
enfilden
yes
i
i
would
rather
you
did
you
and
your
and
some
day
i
should
like
you
to
know
a
little
more
of
thank
you
when
will
you
come
back
i
can
t
tell
but
you
are
not
leaving
not
the
idea
of
leaving
troubled
her
heart
strangely
no
i
am
too
happy
are
you
really
happy
at
any
rate
i
am
happier
than
i
have
ever
been
you
are
on
the
he
was
looking
at
her
with
eyes
in
which
there
was
tenderness
but
suddenly
they
flashed
fire
and
he
exclaimed
my
desert
land
must
not
bring
you
she
was
startled
by
his
sudden
vehemence
what
i
would
not
hear
she
said
you
know
it
it
is
not
my
fault
i
am
ready
to
tell
it
to
no
but
do
you
believe
it
do
you
believe
that
man
can
read
the
future
in
the
sand
how
can
it
be
how
can
a
thousand
things
be
how
can
these
desert
men
stand
in
fire
with
their
naked
feet
set
on
burning
brands
with
burning
brands
under
their
armpits
and
not
be
burned
how
can
they
pierce
themselves
with
skewers
and
cut
themselves
with
knives
and
no
blood
flow
but
i
told
you
the
first
day
i
met
you
the
desert
always
makes
me
the
same
gift
when
i
return
to
what
gift
the
gift
of
then
you
do
believe
in
that
man
aloui
do
you
i
can
only
say
that
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
it
might
be
divination
if
i
had
not
felt
that
i
should
not
have
stopped
it
i
should
have
treated
it
as
a
it
impressed
you
as
it
impresses
me
well
for
both
of
us
the
desert
has
gifts
let
us
accept
them
fearlessly
it
is
the
will
of
she
remembered
her
vision
of
the
pale
procession
would
she
walk
in
it
at
last
you
are
as
fatalistic
as
an
arab
she
said
and
you
i
she
answered
simply
i
believe
that
i
am
in
the
hands
of
god
and
i
know
that
perfect
love
can
never
harm
after
a
moment
he
said
gently
miss
enfilden
i
want
to
ask
something
of
yes
will
you
make
a
sacrifice
i
start
at
dawn
will
you
be
here
to
wish
me
god
speed
on
my
journey
of
course
i
it
will
be
good
of
you
i
shall
value
it
from
you
and
and
when
if
you
ever
make
your
long
journey
on
that
road
the
route
to
the
south
i
will
wish
you
allah
s
blessing
in
the
garden
of
he
spoke
with
solemnity
almost
with
passion
and
she
felt
the
tears
very
near
her
eyes
then
they
sat
in
silence
looking
out
over
the
desert
and
she
heard
its
voices
calling
chapter
xiii
on
the
following
morning
before
dawn
domini
awoke
stirred
from
sleep
by
her
anxiety
persistent
even
in
what
seemed
unconsciousness
to
speed
count
anteoni
upon
his
desert
journey
she
did
not
know
why
he
was
going
but
she
felt
that
some
great
issue
in
his
life
hung
upon
the
accomplishment
of
the
purpose
with
which
he
set
out
and
without
affectation
she
ardently
desired
that
accomplishment
as
soon
as
she
awoke
she
lit
a
candle
and
glanced
at
her
watch
she
knew
by
the
hour
that
the
dawn
was
near
and
she
got
up
at
once
and
made
her
toilet
she
had
told
batouch
to
be
at
the
hotel
door
before
sunrise
to
accompany
her
to
the
garden
and
she
wondered
if
he
were
below
a
stillness
as
of
deep
night
prevailed
in
the
house
making
her
movements
while
she
dressed
seem
unnaturally
loud
when
she
put
on
her
hat
and
looked
into
the
glass
to
see
if
it
were
just
at
the
right
angle
she
thought
her
face
always
white
was
haggard
this
departure
made
her
a
little
sad
it
suggested
to
her
the
instability
of
circumstance
the
perpetual
change
that
occurs
in
life
the
going
of
her
kind
host
made
her
own
going
more
possible
than
before
even
more
likely
some
words
from
the
bible
kept
on
running
through
her
brain
here
have
we
no
continuing
in
the
silent
darkness
their
cadence
held
an
ineffable
melancholy
her
mind
heard
them
as
the
ear
in
a
pathetic
moment
hears
sometimes
a
distant
strain
of
music
wailing
like
a
phantom
through
the
invisible
and
the
everlasting
journeying
of
all
created
things
oppressed
her
heart
when
she
had
buttoned
her
jacket
and
drawn
on
her
gloves
she
went
to
the
french
window
and
pushed
back
the
shutters
a
wan
looked
in
upon
her
again
she
wondered
whether
batouch
had
come
it
seemed
to
her
unlikely
she
could
not
imagine
that
anyone
in
all
the
world
was
up
and
purposeful
but
herself
this
hour
seemed
created
as
a
curtain
for
unconsciousness
very
softly
she
stepped
out
upon
the
verandah
and
looked
over
the
parapet
she
could
see
the
white
road
mysteriously
white
below
it
was
deserted
she
leaned
down
batouch
she
called
softly
batouch
he
might
be
hidden
under
the
arcade
sleeping
in
his
burnous
batouch
batouch
no
answer
came
she
stood
by
the
parapet
waiting
and
looking
down
the
road
all
the
stars
had
faded
yet
there
was
no
suggestion
of
the
sun
she
faced
an
unrelenting
austerity
for
a
moment
she
thought
of
this
atmosphere
this
dense
stillness
this
gravity
of
vague
and
shadowy
trees
as
the
environment
of
those
who
had
erred
of
the
lost
spirits
of
men
who
had
died
in
mortal
sin
almost
she
expected
to
see
the
desperate
shade
of
her
dead
father
pass
between
the
black
stems
of
the
palm
trees
vanish
into
the
grey
mantle
that
wrapped
the
hidden
world
batouch
batouch
he
was
not
there
that
was
certain
she
resolved
to
set
out
alone
and
went
back
into
her
bedroom
to
get
her
revolver
when
she
came
out
again
with
it
in
her
hand
androvsky
was
standing
on
the
verandah
just
outside
her
window
he
took
off
his
hat
and
looked
from
her
face
to
the
revolver
she
was
startled
by
his
appearance
for
she
had
not
heard
his
step
and
had
been
companioned
by
a
sense
of
irreparable
solitude
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
seen
him
since
he
vanished
from
the
garden
on
the
previous
day
you
are
going
out
madame
he
said
not
alone
i
believe
so
unless
i
find
batouch
she
slipped
the
revolver
into
the
pocket
of
the
loose
coat
she
wore
but
it
is
it
will
be
day
very
soon
look
she
pointed
towards
the
east
where
a
light
delicate
and
mysterious
as
the
distant
lights
in
the
opal
was
gently
pushing
in
the
sky
you
ought
not
to
go
unless
batouch
is
there
i
must
i
have
given
a
promise
and
i
must
keep
it
there
is
no
he
hesitated
looking
at
her
with
an
anxious
almost
a
suspicious
expression
monsieur
she
went
towards
the
staircase
he
followed
her
quickly
to
the
head
of
it
don
t
trouble
to
come
down
with
if
if
batouch
is
not
there
might
not
i
guard
you
madame
she
remembered
the
count
s
words
and
answered
let
me
tell
you
where
i
am
going
i
am
going
to
say
to
count
anteoni
before
he
starts
for
his
desert
androvsky
stood
there
without
a
word
now
do
you
care
to
come
if
i
don
t
find
batouch
mind
i
m
not
the
least
perhaps
he
is
there
if
you
told
he
muttered
the
words
his
whole
manner
had
changed
now
he
looked
more
than
suspicious
cloudy
and
fierce
she
began
to
descend
the
stairs
he
did
not
follow
her
but
stood
looking
after
her
when
she
reached
the
arcade
it
was
deserted
batouch
had
forgotten
or
had
overslept
himself
she
could
have
walked
on
under
the
roof
that
was
the
floor
of
the
verandah
but
instead
she
stepped
out
into
the
road
androvsky
was
above
her
by
the
parapet
she
glanced
up
and
said
he
is
not
here
but
it
is
of
no
consequence
dawn
is
breaking
slowly
he
took
off
his
hat
as
she
went
away
down
the
road
he
was
holding
it
in
his
hand
looking
after
her
he
does
not
like
the
count
she
thought
at
the
corner
she
turned
into
the
street
where
the
had
his
bazaar
and
as
she
neared
his
door
she
was
aware
of
a
certain
trepidation
she
did
not
want
to
see
those
piercing
eyes
looking
at
her
in
the
and
she
hurried
her
steps
but
her
anxiety
was
needless
all
the
doors
were
shut
all
the
inhabitants
doubtless
wrapped
in
sleep
yet
when
she
had
gained
the
end
of
the
street
she
looked
back
half
expecting
to
see
an
apparition
of
a
thin
figure
a
tortured
face
to
hear
a
voice
like
a
goblin
s
voice
calling
after
her
midway
down
the
street
there
was
a
man
coming
slowly
behind
her
for
a
moment
she
thought
it
was
the
diviner
in
pursuit
but
something
in
the
gait
soon
showed
her
her
mistake
there
was
a
heaviness
in
the
movement
of
this
man
quite
unlike
the
lithe
and
serpentine
agility
of
aloui
although
she
could
not
see
the
face
or
even
distinguish
the
costume
in
the
morning
twilight
she
knew
it
for
androvsky
from
a
distance
he
was
watching
over
her
she
did
not
hesitate
but
walked
on
quickly
again
she
did
not
wish
him
to
know
that
she
had
seen
him
when
she
came
to
the
long
road
that
skirted
the
desert
she
met
the
breeze
of
dawn
that
blows
out
of
the
east
across
the
flats
and
drank
in
its
celestial
purity
between
the
palms
far
away
towards
above
the
long
indigo
line
of
the
sahara
there
rose
a
curve
of
deep
red
gold
the
sun
was
coming
up
to
take
possession
of
his
waiting
world
she
longed
to
ride
out
to
meet
him
to
give
him
a
passionate
welcome
in
the
sand
and
the
opening
words
of
the
egyptian
adoration
of
the
sun
by
the
perfect
souls
came
to
her
lips
hommage
a
toi
dieu
soleil
seigneur
du
ciel
roi
sur
la
terre
lion
du
soir
grande
ame
divine
vivante
a
why
had
she
not
ordered
her
horse
to
ride
a
little
way
with
count
anteoni
she
might
have
pretended
that
she
was
starting
on
her
great
journey
the
red
gold
curve
became
a
of
burnished
glory
resting
upon
the
deep
blue
then
a
full
circle
that
detached
itself
majestically
and
mounted
calmly
up
the
cloudless
sky
a
stream
of
light
poured
into
the
oasis
and
domini
who
had
paused
for
a
moment
in
silent
worship
went
on
swiftly
through
the
negro
village
which
was
all
astir
and
down
the
track
to
the
white
villa
she
did
not
glance
round
again
to
see
whether
androvsky
was
still
following
her
for
since
the
sun
had
come
she
had
the
confident
sensation
that
he
was
no
longer
near
he
had
surely
given
her
into
the
guardianship
of
the
sun
the
door
of
the
garden
stood
wide
open
and
as
she
entered
she
saw
three
magnificent
horses
prancing
upon
the
sweep
of
sand
in
the
midst
of
a
little
group
of
arabs
smain
greeted
her
with
graceful
warmth
and
begged
her
to
follow
him
to
the
where
the
count
was
waiting
for
her
it
is
good
of
you
the
count
said
meeting
her
in
the
doorway
i
relied
on
you
you
see
breakfast
for
two
was
scattered
upon
the
little
coffee
eggs
rolls
fruit
sweetmeats
and
everywhere
sprigs
of
orange
blossom
filled
the
cool
air
with
delicate
sweetness
how
delicious
she
exclaimed
a
breakfast
here
but
no
not
there
why
not
that
is
exactly
where
he
aloui
how
superstitious
you
are
he
moved
her
table
she
sat
down
near
the
doorway
and
poured
out
coffee
for
them
both
you
look
she
glanced
at
his
and
long
whip
smoked
glasses
hung
across
his
chest
by
a
thin
cord
i
shall
have
some
hard
riding
but
i
m
tough
though
you
may
not
think
it
i
ve
covered
many
a
league
of
my
friend
in
bygone
he
tapped
an
eggshell
smartly
and
began
to
eat
with
appetite
how
gravely
gay
you
are
she
said
lifting
the
steaming
coffee
to
her
lips
he
smiled
yes
i
am
happy
as
a
pious
man
is
happy
when
after
a
long
illness
he
goes
once
more
to
the
desert
seems
to
be
everything
to
i
feel
that
i
am
going
out
to
freedom
to
more
than
he
stretched
out
his
arms
above
his
head
yet
you
have
stayed
always
in
this
garden
all
these
i
was
waiting
for
my
summons
as
you
will
wait
for
what
summons
could
i
have
it
will
come
he
said
with
conviction
it
will
come
she
was
silent
thinking
of
the
diviner
s
vision
in
the
sand
of
the
caravan
of
camels
disappearing
in
the
storm
towards
the
south
presently
she
asked
him
are
you
ever
coming
back
he
looked
at
her
in
surprise
then
laughed
of
course
what
are
you
thinking
that
perhaps
you
will
not
come
back
that
perhaps
the
desert
will
keep
and
my
garden
she
looked
out
across
the
tiny
and
the
running
rill
of
water
to
the
great
trees
stirred
by
the
cool
breeze
of
dawn
it
would
miss
after
a
moment
during
which
his
bright
eyes
followed
hers
he
said
do
you
know
i
have
a
great
belief
in
the
intuitions
of
good
women
yes
an
almost
fanatical
belief
will
you
answer
me
a
question
at
once
without
consideration
without
any
time
for
thought
if
you
ask
me
i
do
ask
then
do
you
see
me
in
this
garden
any
more
a
voice
answered
it
was
her
own
yet
it
seemed
another
s
voice
with
which
she
had
nothing
to
do
a
great
feeling
of
sorrow
swept
over
her
as
she
heard
it
do
come
back
she
said
the
count
had
got
up
the
brightness
of
his
eyes
was
obscured
if
not
here
we
shall
meet
again
he
said
slowly
where
in
the
did
the
diviner
no
don
t
tell
she
got
up
too
it
is
time
for
you
to
start
a
sort
of
constraint
had
settled
over
them
she
felt
it
painfully
for
a
moment
did
it
proceed
from
something
in
his
mind
or
in
hers
she
could
not
tell
they
walked
slowly
down
one
of
the
little
paths
and
presently
found
themselves
before
the
room
in
which
sat
the
purple
dog
if
i
am
never
to
come
back
i
must
say
to
him
the
count
said
but
you
will
come
that
voice
said
it
was
a
lying
they
looked
in
at
the
window
and
met
the
ferocious
eyes
of
the
dog
and
if
i
never
come
back
will
he
bay
the
moon
for
his
old
master
said
the
count
with
a
whimsical
yet
sad
smile
i
put
him
here
and
will
these
trees
many
of
which
i
planted
whisper
a
regret
absurd
isn
t
it
miss
enfilden
i
never
can
feel
that
the
growing
things
in
my
garden
do
not
know
me
as
i
know
someone
will
regret
you
if
will
you
will
you
really
i
believe
he
looked
at
her
she
could
see
by
the
expression
of
his
eyes
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
saying
something
but
was
held
back
by
some
fighting
sensation
perhaps
by
some
reserve
what
is
it
may
i
speak
frankly
to
you
without
offence
he
asked
i
am
really
rather
old
you
do
that
guest
of
mine
yesterday
monsieur
androvsky
yes
he
interested
me
enormously
really
yet
he
was
at
his
worst
perhaps
that
was
why
at
any
rate
he
interested
me
more
than
any
man
i
have
seen
for
years
but
he
paused
looking
in
at
the
little
chamber
where
the
dog
kept
guard
but
my
interest
was
complicated
by
a
feeling
that
i
was
face
to
face
with
a
human
being
who
was
at
odds
with
life
with
himself
even
with
his
creator
a
man
who
had
done
what
the
arabs
never
do
defied
allah
in
allah
s
oh
she
uttered
a
little
exclamation
of
pain
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
gathering
up
and
was
expressing
scattered
half
formless
thoughts
of
hers
you
know
he
continued
looking
more
steadily
into
the
room
of
the
dog
that
in
algeria
there
is
a
floating
population
composed
of
many
mixed
elements
i
could
tell
you
strange
stories
of
tragedies
that
have
occurred
in
this
land
even
here
in
tragedies
of
violence
of
greed
of
tragedies
that
were
not
brought
about
by
he
turned
suddenly
and
looked
right
into
her
eyes
but
why
am
i
saying
all
this
he
suddenly
exclaimed
what
is
written
is
written
and
such
women
as
you
are
guarded
by
whom
by
their
own
i
am
not
afraid
she
said
quietly
need
you
tell
me
that
miss
enfilden
i
scarcely
know
why
i
have
said
even
as
little
as
i
have
said
for
i
am
as
you
know
a
fatalist
but
certain
people
very
few
so
awaken
our
regard
that
they
make
us
forget
our
own
convictions
and
might
even
lead
us
to
try
to
tamper
with
the
designs
of
the
almighty
whatever
is
to
be
for
you
you
will
be
able
to
endure
that
i
know
why
should
i
or
anyone
seek
to
know
more
for
you
but
still
there
are
moments
in
which
the
bravest
want
a
human
hand
to
help
them
a
human
voice
to
comfort
them
in
the
desert
wherever
i
may
be
and
i
shall
tell
you
i
am
at
your
thank
you
she
said
simply
she
gave
him
her
hand
he
held
it
almost
as
a
father
or
a
guardian
might
have
held
it
and
this
garden
is
yours
day
and
night
smain
thank
you
she
said
again
the
shrill
whinnying
of
a
horse
came
to
them
from
a
distance
their
hands
fell
apart
count
anteoni
looked
round
him
slowly
at
the
great
cocoanut
tree
at
the
shaggy
grass
of
the
lawn
at
the
tall
bamboos
and
the
drooping
mulberry
trees
she
saw
that
he
was
taking
a
silent
farewell
of
them
this
was
a
waste
he
said
at
last
with
a
sigh
i
turned
it
into
a
little
eden
and
now
i
am
leaving
for
a
and
if
it
were
for
ever
well
the
great
thing
is
to
let
the
waste
within
one
be
turned
into
an
eden
if
that
is
possible
and
yet
how
many
human
beings
strive
against
the
great
gardener
at
any
rate
i
will
not
be
one
of
and
i
will
not
be
shall
we
say
here
no
let
us
say
it
from
the
wall
and
let
me
see
you
ride
away
into
the
she
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
that
his
route
was
the
road
through
the
oasis
he
did
not
remind
her
of
it
it
was
easy
to
ride
across
the
desert
and
join
the
route
where
it
came
out
from
the
last
palms
so
be
it
will
you
go
to
the
wall
then
he
touched
her
hand
again
and
walked
away
towards
the
villa
slowly
on
the
pale
silver
of
the
sand
when
his
figure
was
hidden
by
the
trunks
of
the
trees
domini
made
her
way
to
the
wide
parapet
she
sat
down
on
one
of
the
tiny
seats
cut
in
it
leaned
her
cheek
in
her
hand
and
waited
the
sun
was
gathering
strength
but
the
air
was
still
deliciously
cool
almost
cold
and
the
desert
had
not
yet
put
on
its
aspect
of
fiery
desolation
it
looked
dreamlike
and
romantic
not
only
in
its
distances
but
near
at
hand
there
must
surely
be
dew
she
fancied
in
the
garden
of
allah
she
could
see
no
one
travelling
in
it
only
some
far
away
camels
grazing
in
the
dawn
the
desert
was
the
home
of
the
breeze
of
gentle
sunbeams
and
of
liberty
presently
she
heard
the
noise
of
horses
cantering
near
at
hand
and
count
anteoni
followed
by
two
arab
attendants
came
round
the
bend
of
the
wall
and
drew
up
beneath
her
he
rode
on
a
high
red
arab
saddle
and
a
gun
was
slung
in
an
embroidered
case
behind
him
on
the
side
a
broad
and
soft
brown
hat
kept
the
sun
from
his
forehead
the
two
attendants
rode
on
a
few
paces
and
waited
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
don
t
you
wish
you
were
going
out
he
said
out
into
that
and
he
pointed
with
his
whip
towards
the
dreamlike
blue
of
the
far
horizon
she
leaned
over
looking
down
at
him
and
at
his
horse
which
fidgeted
and
arched
his
white
neck
and
dropped
foam
from
his
black
flexible
lips
no
she
answered
after
a
moment
of
thought
i
must
speak
the
truth
you
to
me
i
feel
that
you
were
right
that
my
summons
has
not
yet
come
to
and
when
it
comes
i
shall
obey
it
without
fear
even
if
i
go
in
the
storm
and
the
he
glanced
at
the
radiant
sky
at
the
golden
beams
slanting
down
upon
the
palms
the
coran
says
the
fate
of
every
man
have
we
bound
about
his
may
yours
be
as
serene
as
beautiful
as
a
string
of
but
i
have
never
cared
to
wear
pearls
she
answered
no
what
are
your
stones
blood
no
others
the
sky
at
and
fires
gleaming
across
the
white
of
moonlit
dunes
do
you
remember
i
and
you
do
not
ask
me
for
the
end
of
the
diviner
s
vision
even
now
she
hesitated
for
an
instant
then
she
added
i
will
tell
you
why
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
another
s
fate
in
it
as
well
as
my
own
and
that
to
hear
would
be
to
intrude
perhaps
upon
another
s
that
was
your
reason
my
only
and
then
she
added
repeating
consciously
androvsky
s
words
i
think
there
are
things
that
should
be
let
perhaps
you
are
a
stronger
breath
of
the
cool
wind
came
over
the
flats
and
all
the
palm
trees
rustled
through
the
garden
there
was
a
delicate
stir
of
life
my
children
are
murmuring
farewell
said
the
count
i
hear
them
it
is
time
miss
enfilden
my
friend
if
i
may
call
you
so
may
allah
have
you
in
his
keeping
and
when
your
summons
comes
obey
it
as
he
said
the
last
word
his
grating
voice
dropped
to
a
deep
note
of
earnest
almost
solemn
gravity
then
he
lifted
his
hat
touched
his
horse
with
his
heel
and
galloped
away
into
the
sun
domini
watched
the
three
riders
till
they
were
only
specks
on
the
surface
of
the
desert
then
they
became
one
with
it
and
were
lost
in
the
dreamlike
radiance
of
the
morning
but
she
did
not
move
she
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
up
on
the
blue
horizon
a
great
loneliness
had
entered
into
her
spirit
till
count
anteoni
had
gone
she
did
not
realise
how
much
she
had
become
accustomed
to
his
friendship
how
near
their
sympathies
had
been
but
directly
those
tiny
moving
specks
became
one
with
the
desert
she
knew
that
a
gap
had
opened
in
her
life
it
might
be
small
but
it
seemed
dark
and
deep
for
the
first
time
the
desert
which
she
had
hitherto
regarded
as
a
giver
had
taken
something
from
her
and
now
as
she
sat
looking
at
it
while
the
sun
grew
stronger
and
the
light
more
brilliant
while
the
mountains
gradually
assumed
a
harsher
aspect
and
the
details
of
things
in
the
dawn
so
delicately
clear
became
as
it
were
more
piercing
in
their
sharpness
she
realised
a
new
and
terrible
aspect
of
it
that
which
has
the
power
to
bestow
has
another
power
she
had
seen
the
great
procession
of
those
who
had
received
gifts
of
the
desert
s
hands
would
she
some
day
or
in
the
night
when
the
sky
was
like
a
sapphire
see
the
procession
of
those
from
whom
the
desert
had
taken
away
perhaps
their
dreams
perhaps
their
hopes
perhaps
even
all
that
they
passionately
loved
and
had
desperately
clung
to
and
in
which
of
the
two
processions
would
she
walk
she
got
up
with
a
sigh
the
garden
had
become
tragic
to
her
for
the
moment
full
of
a
brooding
melancholy
as
she
turned
to
leave
it
she
resolved
to
go
to
the
priest
she
had
never
yet
entered
his
house
just
then
she
wanted
to
speak
to
someone
with
whom
she
could
be
as
a
little
child
to
whom
she
could
liberate
some
part
of
her
spirit
simply
certain
of
a
simple
yet
not
foolish
reception
of
it
by
one
to
whom
she
could
look
up
she
desired
to
be
not
with
the
friend
so
much
as
with
the
spiritual
director
something
was
alive
within
her
something
of
distress
almost
of
apprehension
which
needed
the
soothing
hand
not
of
human
love
but
of
religion
when
she
reached
the
priest
s
house
was
astir
with
a
pleasant
bustle
of
life
the
military
note
pealed
through
its
symphony
spahis
were
galloping
along
the
white
roads
tirailleurs
went
by
bearing
despatches
zouaves
stood
under
the
palms
staring
calmly
at
the
morning
their
sunburned
hands
loosely
clasped
upon
muskets
whose
butts
rested
in
the
sand
but
domini
scarcely
noticed
the
brilliant
gaiety
of
the
life
about
her
she
was
preoccupied
even
sad
yet
as
she
entered
the
little
garden
of
the
priest
and
tapped
gently
at
his
door
a
sensation
of
hope
sprang
up
in
her
heart
born
of
the
sustaining
power
of
her
religion
an
arab
boy
answered
her
knock
said
that
the
father
was
in
and
led
her
at
once
to
a
small
room
with
whitewashed
walls
and
a
window
opening
on
to
an
enclosure
at
the
back
where
several
large
palm
trees
reared
their
tufted
heads
above
the
sand
in
a
moment
the
priest
came
in
smiling
with
pleasure
and
holding
out
his
hands
in
welcome
father
she
said
at
once
i
am
come
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
have
you
a
few
moments
to
give
me
sit
down
my
child
he
said
he
drew
forward
a
straw
chair
for
her
and
took
one
opposite
you
are
not
in
trouble
i
don
t
know
why
i
should
be
but
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
said
i
want
to
tell
you
a
little
about
my
he
looked
at
her
kindly
without
a
word
his
eyes
were
an
invitation
for
her
to
speak
and
without
further
invitation
in
as
few
and
simple
words
as
possible
she
told
him
why
she
had
come
to
and
something
of
her
parents
tragedy
and
its
effect
upon
her
i
wanted
to
renew
my
heart
to
find
myself
she
said
my
life
has
been
cold
careless
i
never
lost
my
faith
but
i
almost
forgot
that
i
had
it
i
made
little
use
of
it
i
let
it
many
do
that
but
a
time
comes
when
they
feel
that
the
great
weapon
with
which
alone
we
can
fight
the
sorrows
and
dangers
of
the
world
must
be
kept
bright
or
it
may
fail
us
in
the
hour
of
and
this
is
an
hour
of
need
for
you
but
indeed
is
there
ever
an
hour
that
is
not
i
feel
i
she
stopped
suddenly
conscious
of
the
vagueness
of
her
apprehension
it
made
her
position
difficult
speech
hard
for
her
she
felt
that
she
wanted
something
yet
scarcely
knew
what
or
exactly
why
she
had
come
i
have
been
saying
to
count
anteoni
she
resumed
he
has
gone
on
a
desert
for
long
i
don
t
know
but
i
feel
that
it
will
he
comes
and
goes
very
suddenly
often
he
is
here
and
i
do
not
even
know
he
is
a
strange
man
but
i
think
he
is
a
good
as
she
spoke
about
him
she
began
to
realise
that
something
in
him
had
roused
the
desire
in
her
to
come
to
the
priest
and
he
sees
far
she
added
she
looked
steadily
at
the
priest
who
was
waiting
quietly
to
hear
more
she
was
glad
he
did
not
trouble
her
mind
just
then
by
trying
to
help
her
to
go
on
to
be
explicit
i
came
here
to
find
peace
she
continued
and
i
thought
i
had
found
it
i
thought
so
till
we
only
find
peace
in
one
place
and
only
there
by
our
own
will
according
with
god
you
mean
within
is
it
not
so
yes
then
i
was
foolish
to
travel
in
search
of
i
would
not
say
that
place
assists
the
heart
i
think
and
the
way
of
life
i
thought
so
when
you
wished
to
be
a
monk
a
deep
sadness
came
into
his
eyes
yes
he
said
and
even
now
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
say
it
was
not
thy
will
and
so
it
is
not
but
would
you
care
to
tell
me
if
anything
has
occurred
recently
to
trouble
you
something
has
occurred
more
excitement
came
into
her
face
and
manner
do
you
think
she
went
on
that
it
is
right
to
try
to
avoid
what
life
seems
to
be
bringing
to
one
to
seek
shelter
from
from
the
storm
don
t
monks
do
that
please
forgive
me
if
sincerity
will
not
hurt
me
he
interrupted
quietly
if
it
did
i
should
indeed
be
unworthy
of
my
calling
perhaps
it
is
not
right
for
all
perhaps
that
is
why
i
am
here
instead
of
ah
but
i
remember
you
wanted
to
be
one
of
the
that
was
my
first
hope
but
you
very
simply
he
turned
from
his
troubles
to
hers
you
are
hesitating
are
you
not
between
two
courses
i
scarcely
know
but
i
want
you
to
tell
me
ought
we
not
always
to
think
of
others
more
than
of
ourselves
so
long
as
we
take
care
not
to
put
ourselves
in
too
great
danger
the
soul
should
be
brave
but
not
his
voice
had
changed
had
become
stronger
even
a
little
stern
there
are
risks
that
no
good
christian
ought
to
run
it
is
not
cowardice
it
is
wisdom
that
avoids
the
evil
one
i
have
known
people
who
seemed
almost
to
think
it
was
their
mission
to
convert
the
fallen
angels
they
confused
their
powers
with
the
powers
that
belong
to
god
yes
but
it
is
so
difficult
to
if
a
human
being
were
possessed
by
the
devil
would
not
you
try
would
you
not
go
near
to
that
person
if
i
had
prayed
and
been
told
that
any
power
was
given
me
to
do
what
christ
to
cast
out
yes
i
know
but
sometimes
that
power
is
given
even
to
perhaps
especially
to
them
i
think
the
devil
has
more
fear
of
a
good
mother
than
of
many
domini
realised
almost
with
agony
in
that
moment
how
her
own
soul
had
been
stripped
of
a
precious
armour
a
feeling
of
bitter
helplessness
took
possession
of
her
and
of
contempt
for
what
she
now
suddenly
looked
upon
as
foolish
pride
the
priest
saw
that
his
words
had
hurt
her
yet
he
did
not
just
then
try
to
pour
balm
upon
the
wound
you
came
to
me
as
to
a
spiritual
director
did
you
not
he
asked
yes
yet
you
do
not
wish
to
be
frank
with
me
isn
t
that
true
there
was
a
piercing
look
in
the
eyes
he
fixed
upon
her
yes
she
answered
bravely
why
can
not
you
at
least
will
not
you
tell
me
a
similar
reason
to
that
which
had
caused
her
to
refuse
to
hear
what
the
diviner
had
seen
in
the
sand
caused
her
now
to
answer
there
is
something
i
can
not
say
i
am
sure
i
am
right
not
to
say
do
you
wish
me
to
speak
frankly
to
you
my
child
yes
you
you
have
told
me
enough
of
your
past
life
to
make
me
feel
sure
that
for
some
time
to
come
you
ought
to
be
very
careful
in
regard
to
your
faith
by
the
mercy
of
god
you
have
been
preserved
from
the
greatest
of
all
dangers
the
danger
of
losing
your
belief
in
the
teachings
of
the
only
true
church
you
have
come
here
to
renew
your
faith
which
not
killed
has
been
stricken
reduced
may
i
not
say
to
a
sort
of
invalidism
are
you
sure
you
are
in
a
condition
yet
to
help
he
hesitated
obviously
then
slowly
others
there
are
periods
in
which
one
can
not
do
what
one
may
be
able
to
do
in
the
far
future
the
convalescent
who
is
just
tottering
in
the
new
attempt
to
walk
is
not
wise
enough
to
lend
an
arm
to
another
to
do
so
may
seem
nobly
unselfish
but
is
it
not
folly
and
then
my
child
we
ought
to
be
scrupulously
aware
what
is
our
real
motive
for
wishing
to
assist
another
is
it
of
god
or
is
it
of
ourselves
is
it
a
personal
desire
to
increase
a
perhaps
unworthy
a
worldly
happiness
egoism
is
a
parent
of
many
children
and
often
they
do
not
recognise
their
just
for
a
moment
domini
felt
a
heat
of
anger
rise
within
her
she
did
not
express
it
and
did
not
know
that
she
had
shown
a
sign
of
it
till
she
heard
father
roubier
say
if
you
knew
how
often
i
have
found
that
what
for
a
moment
i
believed
to
be
my
noblest
aspirations
had
sprung
from
a
tiny
hidden
seed
of
egoism
at
once
her
anger
died
away
that
is
terribly
true
she
said
of
us
all
i
she
got
up
you
are
going
yes
i
want
to
think
something
out
you
have
made
me
want
to
i
must
do
it
perhaps
i
ll
come
do
i
want
to
help
you
if
i
there
was
such
a
heartfelt
sound
in
his
voice
that
impulsively
she
held
out
her
hand
i
know
you
do
perhaps
you
will
be
able
but
even
as
she
said
the
last
words
doubt
crept
into
her
mind
even
into
her
voice
the
priest
came
to
his
gate
to
see
domini
off
and
directly
she
had
left
him
she
noticed
that
androvsky
was
under
the
arcade
and
had
been
a
witness
of
their
parting
as
she
went
past
him
and
into
the
hotel
she
saw
that
he
looked
greatly
disturbed
and
excited
his
face
was
lit
up
by
the
now
fiery
glare
of
the
sun
and
when
in
passing
she
nodded
to
him
and
he
took
off
his
hat
he
cast
at
her
a
glance
that
was
like
an
accusation
as
soon
as
she
gained
the
verandah
she
heard
his
heavy
step
upon
the
stair
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
should
she
go
into
her
room
and
so
avoid
him
or
remain
and
let
him
speak
to
her
she
knew
that
he
was
following
her
with
that
purpose
her
mind
was
almost
instantly
made
up
she
crossed
the
verandah
and
sat
down
in
the
low
chair
that
was
always
placed
outside
her
french
window
androvsky
followed
her
and
stood
beside
her
he
did
not
say
anything
for
a
moment
nor
did
she
then
he
spoke
with
a
sort
of
passionate
attempt
to
sound
careless
and
indifferent
monsieur
anteoni
has
gone
i
suppose
madame
yes
he
has
gone
i
reached
the
garden
safely
you
batouch
came
later
he
was
much
ashamed
when
he
found
you
had
gone
i
believe
he
is
afraid
and
is
hiding
himself
till
your
anger
shall
have
passed
she
laughed
batouch
could
not
easily
make
me
angry
i
am
not
like
you
monsieur
her
sudden
challenge
startled
him
as
she
had
meant
it
should
he
moved
quickly
as
at
an
unexpected
touch
i
madame
yes
i
think
you
are
very
often
angry
i
think
you
are
angry
his
face
was
flooded
with
red
why
should
i
be
angry
he
stammered
like
a
man
completely
taken
aback
how
can
i
tell
but
as
i
came
in
just
now
you
looked
at
me
as
if
you
wanted
to
punish
i
i
am
afraid
it
seems
that
my
face
says
a
great
deal
that
that
your
lips
would
not
choose
to
say
well
it
does
why
are
you
angry
with
me
she
gazed
at
him
mercilessly
studying
the
trouble
of
his
face
the
combative
part
of
her
nature
had
been
roused
by
the
glance
he
had
cast
at
her
what
right
had
he
had
any
man
to
look
at
her
like
that
her
blunt
directness
lashed
him
back
into
the
firmness
he
had
lost
she
felt
in
a
moment
that
there
was
a
fighting
capacity
in
him
equal
perhaps
superior
to
her
own
when
i
saw
you
come
from
the
priest
s
house
madame
i
felt
as
if
you
had
been
there
speaking
about
me
about
my
conduct
of
indeed
why
should
i
do
that
i
thought
as
you
had
kindly
wished
me
to
come
he
stopped
well
she
said
in
rather
a
hard
voice
madame
i
don
t
know
what
i
thought
what
i
think
only
i
can
not
bear
that
you
should
apologise
for
any
conduct
of
mine
indeed
i
can
not
bear
he
looked
fearfully
excited
and
moved
two
or
three
steps
away
then
returned
were
you
doing
that
he
asked
were
you
madame
i
never
mentioned
your
name
to
father
roubier
nor
did
he
to
me
she
answered
for
a
moment
he
looked
relieved
then
a
sudden
suspicion
seemed
to
strike
him
but
without
mentioning
my
name
he
said
you
wish
to
accuse
me
of
quibbling
of
insincerity
then
she
exclaimed
with
a
heat
almost
equal
to
his
own
no
madame
no
madame
i
i
have
suffered
much
i
am
suspicious
of
everybody
forgive
me
forgive
me
he
spoke
almost
with
distraction
in
his
manner
there
was
something
desperate
i
am
sure
you
have
suffered
she
said
more
gently
yet
with
a
certain
inflexibility
at
which
she
herself
wondered
yet
which
she
could
not
control
you
will
always
suffer
if
you
can
not
govern
yourself
you
will
make
people
dislike
you
be
suspicious
of
suspicious
who
is
suspicious
of
me
he
asked
sharply
who
has
any
right
to
be
suspicious
of
me
she
looked
up
and
fancied
that
for
an
instant
she
saw
something
as
ugly
as
terror
in
his
eyes
surely
you
know
that
people
don
t
ask
permission
to
be
suspicious
of
their
she
said
no
one
here
has
any
right
to
consider
me
or
my
actions
he
said
fierceness
blazing
out
of
him
i
am
a
free
man
and
can
do
as
i
will
no
one
has
any
right
no
one
domini
felt
as
if
the
words
were
meant
for
her
as
if
he
had
struck
her
she
was
so
angry
that
she
did
not
trust
herself
to
speak
and
instinctively
she
put
her
hand
up
to
her
breast
as
a
woman
might
who
had
received
a
blow
she
touched
something
small
and
hard
that
was
hidden
beneath
her
gown
it
was
the
little
wooden
crucifix
androvsky
had
thrown
into
the
stream
at
as
she
realised
that
her
anger
died
she
was
humbled
and
ashamed
what
was
her
religion
if
at
a
word
she
could
be
stirred
to
such
a
feeling
of
passion
i
at
least
am
not
suspicious
of
you
she
said
choosing
the
very
words
that
were
most
difficult
for
her
to
say
just
then
and
father
roubier
if
you
included
him
is
too
to
cherish
unworthy
suspicions
of
she
got
up
her
voice
was
full
of
a
subdued
but
strong
emotion
oh
monsieur
androvsky
she
said
do
go
over
and
see
him
make
friends
with
him
never
mind
yesterday
i
want
you
to
be
friends
with
him
with
everyone
here
let
us
make
a
place
of
peace
and
good
then
she
went
across
the
verandah
quickly
to
her
room
and
passed
in
closing
the
window
behind
her
was
brought
into
her
she
ate
it
in
solitude
and
late
in
the
afternoon
she
went
out
on
the
verandah
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
spend
an
hour
in
the
church
she
had
told
father
roubier
that
she
wanted
to
think
something
out
since
she
had
left
him
the
burden
upon
her
mind
had
become
heavier
and
she
longed
to
be
alone
in
the
twilight
near
the
altar
perhaps
she
might
be
able
to
cast
down
the
burden
there
in
the
verandah
she
stood
for
a
moment
and
thought
how
wonderful
was
the
difference
between
dawn
and
sunset
in
this
land
the
gardens
that
had
looked
like
a
place
of
departed
and
unhappy
spirits
when
she
rose
that
day
were
now
bathed
in
the
luminous
rays
of
the
declining
sun
were
alive
with
the
voices
of
children
quivered
with
romance
with
a
dreamlike
golden
charm
the
stillness
of
the
evening
was
intense
enclosing
the
children
s
voices
which
presently
died
away
but
while
she
was
marvelling
at
it
she
was
disturbed
by
a
sharp
noise
of
knocking
she
looked
in
the
direction
from
which
it
came
and
saw
androvsky
standing
before
the
priest
s
door
as
she
looked
the
door
was
opened
by
the
arab
boy
and
androvsky
went
in
then
she
did
not
think
of
the
gardens
any
more
with
a
radiant
expression
in
her
eyes
she
went
down
and
crossed
over
to
the
church
it
was
empty
she
went
softly
to
a
near
the
altar
knelt
down
and
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
at
first
she
did
not
pray
or
even
think
consciously
but
just
rested
in
the
attitude
which
always
seems
to
bring
humanity
nearest
its
god
and
almost
immediately
she
began
to
feel
a
quietude
of
spirit
as
if
something
delicate
descended
upon
her
and
lay
lightly
about
her
shrouding
her
from
the
troubles
of
the
world
how
sweet
it
was
to
have
the
faith
that
brings
with
it
such
tender
protection
to
have
the
trust
that
keeps
alive
through
the
swift
passage
of
the
years
the
spirit
of
the
little
child
how
sweet
it
was
to
be
able
to
rest
there
was
at
this
moment
a
sensation
of
deep
joy
within
her
it
grew
in
the
silence
of
the
church
and
as
it
grew
brought
with
it
presently
a
growing
consciousness
of
the
lives
beyond
those
walls
of
other
spirits
capable
of
suffering
of
conflict
and
of
peace
not
far
away
till
she
knew
that
this
present
blessing
of
happiness
came
to
her
not
only
from
the
thought
of
god
but
also
from
the
thought
of
man
close
by
divided
from
her
only
by
a
little
masonry
a
few
feet
of
sand
a
few
palm
trees
androvsky
was
with
the
priest
still
kneeling
with
her
face
between
her
hands
domini
began
to
think
and
pray
the
memory
of
her
petition
to
notre
dame
de
la
garde
came
back
to
her
before
she
knew
africa
she
had
prayed
for
men
wandering
and
perhaps
unhappy
there
for
men
whom
she
would
probably
never
see
again
would
never
know
and
now
that
she
was
growing
familiar
with
this
land
divined
something
of
its
wonders
and
its
dangers
she
prayed
for
a
man
in
it
whom
she
did
not
know
who
was
very
near
to
her
making
a
sacrifice
of
his
prejudices
perhaps
of
his
fears
at
her
desire
she
prayed
for
androvsky
without
words
making
of
her
feelings
of
gratitude
to
him
a
prayer
and
presently
in
the
darkness
framed
by
her
hands
she
seemed
to
see
liberty
once
more
as
in
the
shadows
of
the
standing
beside
a
man
who
prayed
far
out
in
the
glory
of
the
desert
the
storm
spoken
of
by
the
diviner
did
not
always
rage
it
was
stilled
to
hear
his
prayer
and
the
darkness
had
fled
and
the
light
drew
near
to
listen
she
pressed
her
face
more
strongly
against
her
hands
and
began
to
think
more
definitely
was
this
interview
with
the
priest
the
first
step
taken
by
androvsky
towards
the
gift
the
desert
held
for
him
he
must
surely
be
a
man
who
hated
religion
or
thought
he
hated
it
perhaps
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
chain
instead
of
as
the
hammer
that
strikes
away
the
fetters
from
the
slave
yet
he
had
worn
a
crucifix
she
lifted
her
head
put
her
hand
into
her
breast
and
drew
out
the
crucifix
what
was
its
history
she
wondered
as
she
looked
at
it
had
someone
who
loved
him
given
it
to
him
someone
perhaps
who
grieved
at
his
hatred
of
holiness
and
who
fancied
that
this
very
humble
symbol
might
one
day
as
the
humble
symbols
sometimes
do
prove
itself
a
little
guide
towards
shining
truth
had
a
woman
given
it
to
him
she
laid
the
cross
down
on
the
edge
of
the
there
was
red
fire
gleaming
now
on
the
windows
of
the
church
she
realised
the
pageant
that
was
marching
up
the
west
the
passion
of
the
world
as
well
as
the
purity
which
lay
beyond
the
world
her
mind
was
disturbed
she
glanced
from
the
red
radiance
on
the
glass
to
the
dull
brown
wood
of
the
cross
blood
and
agony
had
made
it
the
mystical
symbol
that
it
was
blood
and
agony
she
had
something
to
think
out
that
burden
was
still
upon
her
mind
and
now
again
she
felt
its
weight
a
weight
that
her
interview
with
the
priest
had
not
lifted
for
she
had
not
been
able
to
be
quite
frank
with
the
priest
something
had
held
her
back
from
absolute
sincerity
and
so
he
had
not
spoken
quite
plainly
all
that
was
in
his
mind
his
words
had
been
a
little
vague
yet
she
had
understood
the
meaning
that
lay
behind
them
really
he
had
warned
her
against
androvsky
there
were
two
men
of
very
different
types
one
was
unworldly
as
a
child
the
other
knew
the
world
neither
of
them
had
any
acquaintance
with
androvsky
s
history
and
both
had
warned
her
it
was
instinct
then
that
had
spoken
in
them
telling
them
that
he
was
a
man
to
be
shunned
perhaps
feared
and
her
own
instinct
what
had
it
said
what
did
it
say
for
a
long
time
she
remained
in
the
church
but
she
could
not
think
clearly
reason
calmly
or
even
pray
passionately
for
a
vagueness
had
come
into
her
mind
like
the
vagueness
of
twilight
that
filled
the
space
beneath
the
starry
roof
softening
the
crudeness
of
the
ornaments
the
garish
colours
of
the
plaster
saints
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
thoughts
and
feelings
lost
their
outlines
that
she
watched
them
fading
like
the
shrouded
forms
of
arabs
fading
in
the
tunnels
of
mimosa
but
as
they
vanished
surely
they
whispered
that
which
is
written
is
the
mosques
of
islam
echoed
these
words
and
surely
this
little
church
that
bravely
stood
among
them
that
which
is
written
is
domini
rose
from
her
knees
hid
the
wooden
cross
once
more
in
her
breast
and
went
out
into
the
evening
as
she
left
the
church
door
something
occurred
which
struck
the
vagueness
from
her
she
came
upon
androvsky
and
the
priest
they
were
standing
together
at
the
latter
s
gate
which
he
was
in
the
act
of
opening
to
an
accompaniment
of
joyous
barking
from
both
men
looked
strongly
expressive
as
if
both
had
been
making
an
effort
of
some
kind
she
stopped
in
the
twilight
to
speak
to
them
monsieur
androvsky
has
kindly
been
paying
me
a
visit
said
father
roubier
i
am
glad
domini
said
we
ought
all
to
be
friends
there
was
a
perceptible
pause
then
androvsky
lifted
his
hat
madame
he
said
and
he
walked
away
quickly
the
priest
looked
after
him
and
sighed
profoundly
oh
madame
he
exclaimed
as
if
impelled
to
liberate
his
mind
to
someone
what
is
the
matter
with
that
man
what
is
the
matter
he
stared
fixedly
into
the
twilight
after
androvsky
s
retreating
form
with
monsieur
androvsky
she
spoke
quietly
but
her
mind
was
full
of
apprehension
and
she
looked
searchingly
at
the
priest
yes
what
can
it
be
but
i
don
t
why
did
he
come
to
see
me
i
asked
him
to
she
blurted
out
the
words
without
knowing
why
only
feeling
that
she
must
speak
the
truth
you
asked
him
yes
i
wanted
you
to
be
friends
and
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
yes
i
wanted
you
to
be
she
repeated
it
almost
stubbornly
i
have
never
before
felt
so
ill
at
ease
with
any
human
being
exclaimed
the
priest
with
tense
excitement
and
yet
i
could
not
let
him
go
whenever
he
was
about
to
leave
me
i
was
impelled
to
press
him
to
remain
we
spoke
of
the
most
ordinary
things
and
all
the
time
it
was
as
if
we
were
in
a
great
tragedy
what
is
he
what
can
he
be
he
still
looked
down
the
road
i
don
t
know
i
know
nothing
he
is
a
man
travelling
as
other
men
oh
no
what
do
you
mean
father
i
mean
that
other
travellers
are
not
like
this
he
leaned
his
thin
hands
heavily
on
the
gate
and
she
saw
by
the
expression
of
his
eyes
that
he
was
going
to
say
something
startling
madame
he
said
lowering
his
voice
i
did
not
speak
quite
frankly
to
you
this
afternoon
you
may
or
you
may
not
have
understood
what
i
meant
but
now
i
will
speak
plainly
as
a
priest
i
warn
you
i
warn
you
most
solemnly
not
to
make
friends
with
this
there
was
a
silence
then
domini
said
please
give
me
your
reason
for
this
that
i
can
t
because
you
have
no
reason
or
because
it
is
not
one
you
care
to
tell
me
i
have
no
reason
to
give
my
reason
is
my
instinct
i
know
nothing
of
this
man
i
pity
him
i
shall
pray
for
him
he
needs
prayers
yes
he
needs
them
but
you
are
a
woman
out
here
alone
you
have
spoken
to
me
of
yourself
and
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
say
that
i
advise
you
most
earnestly
to
break
off
your
acquaintance
with
monsieur
do
you
mean
that
you
think
him
evil
i
don
t
know
whether
he
is
evil
i
don
t
know
what
he
i
know
he
is
not
the
priest
looked
at
her
wondering
you
know
how
my
instinct
she
said
coming
a
step
nearer
and
putting
her
hand
too
on
the
gate
near
his
why
should
we
desert
him
desert
him
madame
father
roubier
s
voice
sounded
amazed
yes
you
say
he
needs
prayers
i
know
it
father
are
not
the
first
prayers
the
truest
those
that
go
most
swiftly
to
heaven
acts
the
priest
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
her
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
deeply
why
did
you
send
monsieur
androvsky
to
me
this
afternoon
he
said
at
last
abruptly
i
knew
you
were
a
good
man
and
i
fancied
if
you
became
friends
you
might
help
his
face
softened
a
good
man
he
said
ah
he
shook
his
head
sadly
with
a
sound
that
was
like
a
little
pathetic
laugh
i
a
good
man
and
i
allow
an
almost
invincible
personal
feeling
to
conquer
my
inward
sense
of
right
madame
come
into
the
garden
for
a
he
opened
the
gate
she
passed
in
and
he
led
her
round
the
house
to
the
enclosure
at
the
back
where
they
could
talk
in
greater
privacy
then
he
continued
you
are
right
madame
i
am
here
to
try
to
do
god
s
work
and
sometimes
it
is
better
to
act
for
a
human
being
perhaps
even
than
to
pray
for
him
i
will
tell
you
that
i
feel
an
almost
invincible
repugnance
to
monsieur
androvsky
a
repugnance
that
is
almost
stronger
than
my
will
to
hold
it
in
he
shivered
slightly
but
with
god
s
help
i
ll
conquer
that
if
he
stays
on
here
i
ll
try
to
be
his
friend
i
ll
do
all
i
can
if
he
is
unhappy
far
away
from
good
perhaps
i
say
it
humbly
madame
i
assure
you
i
might
help
him
but
and
here
his
face
and
manner
changed
became
firmer
more
dominating
you
are
not
a
priest
and
no
only
a
woman
she
said
interrupting
him
something
in
her
voice
arrested
him
there
was
a
long
silence
in
which
they
paced
slowly
up
and
down
on
the
sand
between
the
palm
trees
the
twilight
was
dying
into
night
already
the
tomtoms
were
throbbing
in
the
street
of
the
dancers
and
the
shriek
of
the
distant
pipes
was
faintly
heard
at
last
the
priest
spoke
again
madame
he
said
when
you
came
to
me
this
afternoon
there
was
something
that
you
could
not
tell
had
it
anything
to
do
with
monsieur
androvsky
i
meant
to
ask
you
to
advise
me
about
my
advice
to
you
was
and
is
be
strong
but
not
too
believe
me
i
will
try
not
to
be
foolhardy
but
you
said
something
else
too
something
about
women
don
t
you
remember
she
stopped
took
his
hands
impulsively
and
pressed
them
father
i
ve
scarcely
ever
been
of
any
use
all
my
life
i
ve
scarcely
ever
tried
to
be
nothing
within
me
said
you
could
be
and
if
it
had
i
was
so
dulled
by
routine
and
sorrow
that
i
don
t
think
i
should
have
heard
it
but
here
it
is
different
i
am
not
dulled
i
can
hear
and
suppose
i
can
be
of
use
for
the
first
time
you
wouldn
t
say
to
me
don
t
try
you
couldn
t
say
that
he
stood
holding
her
hands
and
looking
into
her
face
for
a
moment
then
he
said
my
child
perhaps
you
know
your
own
strength
best
perhaps
your
safest
spiritual
director
is
your
own
heart
who
knows
but
whether
it
be
so
or
not
you
will
not
take
advice
from
she
knew
that
was
true
now
and
for
a
moment
felt
almost
ashamed
forgive
me
she
said
but
it
is
strange
and
may
seem
to
you
ridiculous
or
even
wrong
ever
since
i
have
been
here
i
have
felt
as
if
everything
that
happened
had
been
arranged
beforehand
as
if
it
had
to
happen
and
i
feel
that
too
about
the
count
anteoni
s
fatalism
the
priest
said
with
a
touch
of
impatient
irritation
i
know
it
is
the
guiding
spirit
of
this
land
and
you
too
are
going
to
be
led
by
it
take
care
you
have
come
to
a
land
of
fire
and
i
think
you
are
made
of
for
a
moment
she
saw
a
fanatical
expression
in
his
eyes
she
thought
of
it
as
the
look
of
the
monk
crushed
down
within
his
soul
he
opened
his
lips
again
as
if
to
pour
forth
upon
her
a
torrent
of
burning
words
but
the
look
died
away
and
they
parted
quietly
like
two
good
friends
yet
as
she
went
to
the
hotel
she
knew
that
father
roubier
could
not
give
her
the
kind
of
help
she
wanted
and
she
even
fancied
that
perhaps
no
priest
could
her
heart
was
in
a
turmoil
and
she
seemed
to
be
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
batouch
was
at
the
door
looking
elaborately
contrite
and
ready
with
his
lie
he
had
been
seized
with
fever
in
the
night
in
token
whereof
he
held
up
hands
which
began
to
shake
like
leaves
only
now
had
he
been
able
to
drag
himself
from
his
quilt
and
still
afflicted
as
he
was
to
creep
to
his
honoured
patron
and
crave
her
pardon
domini
gave
it
with
an
abstracted
carelessness
that
evidently
hurt
his
pride
and
was
passing
into
the
hotel
when
he
said
irena
is
going
to
marry
hadj
since
the
fracas
at
the
both
the
dancer
and
her
victim
had
been
under
lock
and
key
to
marry
her
after
she
tried
to
kill
him
said
domini
yes
madame
he
loves
her
as
the
palm
tree
loves
the
sun
he
will
take
her
to
his
room
and
she
will
wear
a
veil
and
work
for
him
and
never
go
out
any
what
she
will
live
like
the
arab
women
of
course
madame
but
there
is
a
very
nice
terrace
on
the
roof
outside
hadj
s
room
and
hadj
will
permit
her
to
take
the
air
there
in
the
evening
or
when
it
is
she
must
love
hadj
very
she
does
or
why
should
she
try
to
kill
him
so
that
was
an
african
love
a
and
a
taking
of
the
veil
the
thought
of
it
added
a
further
complication
to
the
disorder
that
was
in
her
mind
i
will
see
you
after
dinner
batouch
she
said
she
felt
that
she
must
do
something
go
somewhere
that
night
she
could
not
remain
quiet
batouch
drew
himself
up
and
threw
out
his
broad
chest
his
air
gave
place
to
importance
and
as
he
leaned
against
the
white
pillar
of
the
arcade
folded
his
ample
burnous
round
him
and
glanced
up
at
the
sky
he
saw
in
fancy
a
piece
glittering
in
the
chariot
of
the
moon
the
priest
did
not
come
to
dinner
that
night
but
androvsky
was
already
at
his
table
when
domini
came
into
the
he
got
up
from
his
seat
and
bowed
formally
but
did
not
speak
remembering
his
outburst
of
the
morning
she
realised
the
suspicion
which
her
second
interview
with
the
priest
had
probably
created
in
his
mind
and
now
she
was
not
free
from
a
feeling
of
discomfort
that
almost
resembled
guilt
for
now
she
had
been
led
to
discuss
androvsky
with
father
roubier
and
had
it
not
been
almost
an
apology
when
she
said
i
know
he
is
not
evil
once
or
twice
during
dinner
when
her
eyes
met
androvsky
s
for
a
moment
she
imagined
that
he
must
know
why
she
had
been
at
the
priest
s
house
that
anger
was
steadily
increasing
in
him
he
was
a
man
who
hated
to
be
observed
to
be
criticised
his
sensitiveness
was
altogether
abnormal
and
made
her
wonder
afresh
where
his
previous
life
had
been
passed
it
must
surely
have
been
a
very
sheltered
existence
contact
with
the
world
blunts
the
fine
edge
of
our
feeling
with
regard
to
others
opinion
of
us
in
the
world
men
learn
to
be
heedless
of
the
everlasting
buzz
of
comment
that
attends
their
goings
out
and
their
comings
in
but
androvsky
was
like
a
youth
alive
to
the
tiniest
whisper
set
on
fire
by
a
glance
to
such
a
nature
life
in
the
world
must
be
perpetual
torture
she
thought
of
him
with
a
sorrow
that
strangely
in
her
was
not
tinged
with
contempt
that
which
manifested
by
another
man
would
certainly
have
moved
her
to
impatience
if
not
to
wrath
in
this
man
woke
other
sensations
curiosity
pity
terror
yes
terror
she
knew
that
the
long
day
begun
in
the
semidarkness
before
the
dawn
and
ending
in
the
semidarkness
of
the
twilight
had
with
its
events
that
would
have
seemed
to
another
ordinary
and
trivial
enough
carried
her
forward
a
stage
on
an
emotional
pilgrimage
the
warnings
of
count
anteoni
and
of
the
priest
followed
by
the
latter
s
almost
passionately
abrupt
plain
speaking
had
not
been
without
effect
something
of
europe
and
her
life
there
with
its
civilised
experience
and
drastic
training
in
the
management
of
woman
s
relations
with
humanity
in
general
crept
back
under
the
palm
trees
and
the
brilliant
stars
of
africa
and
despite
the
fatalism
condemned
by
father
roubier
she
was
more
conscious
than
she
had
hitherto
been
of
how
others
the
outside
world
would
be
likely
to
regard
her
acquaintance
with
androvsky
she
stood
as
it
were
and
looked
on
at
the
events
in
which
she
herself
had
been
and
was
involved
and
in
that
moment
she
was
first
aware
of
a
thrill
of
something
akin
to
terror
as
if
perhaps
without
knowing
it
she
had
been
moving
amid
a
great
darkness
as
if
perhaps
a
great
darkness
were
approaching
suddenly
she
saw
androvsky
as
some
strange
and
ghastly
figure
of
legend
as
the
wandering
jew
met
by
a
traveller
at
cross
roads
and
distinguished
for
an
instant
in
an
oblique
lightning
flash
as
vanderdecken
passing
in
the
hurricane
and
throwing
a
illumination
from
the
sails
of
his
haunted
ship
as
the
everlasting
climber
of
the
brocken
as
the
shrouded
arab
of
the
eastern
legend
who
announced
coming
disaster
to
the
wanderers
in
the
desert
by
beating
a
on
a
drum
among
the
dunes
and
with
count
anteoni
and
the
priest
she
set
another
figure
that
of
the
whose
tortured
face
had
suggested
a
man
looking
on
a
fate
that
was
terrible
had
not
he
too
warned
her
had
not
the
warning
been
threefold
been
given
to
her
by
the
world
the
church
and
the
the
world
beneath
the
veil
she
met
androvsky
s
eyes
he
was
getting
up
to
leave
the
room
his
movement
caught
her
away
from
things
visionary
but
not
from
worldly
things
she
still
looked
on
herself
moving
amid
these
events
at
which
her
world
would
laugh
or
wonder
and
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
uneasily
because
of
the
self
that
watched
herself
as
if
that
self
held
something
coldly
satirical
that
mocked
at
her
and
marvelled
chapter
xiv
what
shall
i
do
alone
in
the
now
empty
domini
asked
herself
the
question
she
was
restless
terribly
restless
in
mind
and
wanted
distraction
the
idea
of
going
to
her
room
of
reading
even
of
sitting
quietly
in
the
verandah
was
intolerable
to
her
she
longed
for
action
swiftness
excitement
the
help
of
outside
things
of
that
exterior
life
which
she
had
told
count
anteoni
she
had
begun
to
see
as
a
mirage
had
she
been
in
a
city
she
would
have
gone
to
a
theatre
to
witness
some
tremendous
drama
or
to
hear
some
passionate
or
terrible
opera
might
have
been
a
place
of
many
and
strange
tragedies
would
be
no
doubt
again
but
it
offered
at
this
moment
little
to
satisfy
her
mood
the
dances
of
the
cafes
maures
the
songs
of
the
smokers
of
the
keef
the
long
histories
of
the
between
the
lighted
candles
she
wanted
none
of
these
and
for
a
moment
she
wished
she
were
in
london
paris
any
great
capital
that
spent
itself
to
suit
the
changing
moods
of
men
with
a
sigh
she
got
up
and
went
out
to
the
arcade
batouch
joined
her
immediately
what
can
i
do
batouch
she
said
there
are
the
femmes
mauresques
he
began
no
would
madame
like
to
hear
the
no
i
should
not
understand
i
can
explain
to
she
stepped
out
into
the
road
there
will
be
a
moon
won
t
there
she
said
looking
up
at
the
starry
sky
yes
madame
what
time
will
it
rise
between
nine
and
she
stood
in
the
road
thinking
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
never
seen
moonrise
in
the
desert
and
now
it
is
she
looked
at
her
watch
only
does
madame
wish
to
see
the
moon
come
up
pouring
upon
the
palms
don
t
talk
so
much
batouch
she
said
brusquely
the
easy
and
luscious
imaginings
of
the
poet
worried
her
like
the
cry
of
a
mosquito
his
presence
even
disturbed
her
yet
what
could
she
do
without
him
after
a
pause
she
said
can
one
go
into
the
desert
at
night
on
foot
madame
it
would
be
dangerous
one
can
not
tell
what
may
be
in
the
desert
by
these
words
made
her
long
to
go
they
had
a
charm
a
violence
perhaps
of
the
unknown
one
might
ride
she
said
why
not
who
could
hurt
us
if
we
were
mounted
and
armed
madame
is
brave
as
the
panther
in
the
forests
of
the
and
you
batouch
aren
t
you
brave
madame
i
am
afraid
of
he
did
not
say
it
boastfully
like
hadj
but
calmly
almost
loftily
well
we
are
neither
of
us
afraid
let
us
ride
out
on
the
tombouctou
road
and
see
the
moon
rise
i
ll
go
and
put
on
my
madame
should
take
her
of
course
bring
the
horses
round
at
when
she
had
put
on
her
habit
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
after
eight
she
longed
to
be
in
the
saddle
going
at
full
speed
up
the
long
white
road
between
the
palms
physical
movement
was
necessary
to
her
and
she
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
verandah
quickly
she
wished
she
had
ordered
the
horses
at
once
or
that
she
could
do
something
definite
to
fill
up
the
time
till
they
came
as
she
turned
at
the
end
of
the
verandah
she
saw
a
white
form
approaching
her
when
it
drew
near
she
recognised
hadj
looking
and
mischievous
but
a
little
triumphant
too
at
this
moment
she
was
glad
to
see
him
he
received
her
congratulations
on
his
recovery
and
approaching
marriage
with
a
sort
of
skittish
gaiety
but
she
soon
discovered
that
he
had
come
with
a
reason
having
seen
his
cousin
safely
off
the
premises
it
had
evidently
occurred
to
him
to
turn
an
honest
penny
and
pennies
were
now
specially
needful
to
him
in
view
of
married
life
does
madame
wish
to
see
something
strange
and
wonderful
he
asked
after
a
moment
looking
at
her
sideways
out
of
the
corners
of
his
wicked
eyes
which
as
domini
could
see
were
swift
to
read
character
and
mood
i
am
going
out
he
looked
astonished
in
the
night
yes
batouch
has
gone
to
fetch
the
hadj
s
face
became
a
mask
of
sulkiness
if
madame
goes
out
with
batouch
she
will
be
killed
there
are
robbers
in
the
desert
and
batouch
is
afraid
of
could
we
see
the
strange
and
wonderful
thing
in
an
hour
she
interrupted
the
gay
and
skittish
expression
returned
instantly
to
his
face
yes
what
is
it
he
shook
his
head
and
made
an
artful
gesture
with
his
hand
in
the
air
madame
shall
his
long
eyes
were
full
of
mystery
and
he
moved
towards
the
staircase
come
domini
laughed
and
followed
him
she
felt
as
if
she
were
playing
a
game
yet
her
curiosity
was
roused
they
went
softly
down
and
slipped
out
of
the
hotel
like
children
fearing
to
be
caught
batouch
will
be
angry
there
will
be
white
foam
on
his
lips
whispered
hadj
dropping
his
chin
and
chuckling
low
in
his
throat
this
way
he
led
her
quickly
across
the
gardens
to
the
rue
berthe
and
down
a
number
of
small
streets
till
they
reached
a
white
house
before
which
on
a
hump
three
palm
trees
grew
from
one
trunk
beyond
was
waste
ground
and
further
away
a
stretch
of
sand
and
low
dunes
lost
in
the
darkness
of
the
as
yet
moonless
night
domini
looked
at
the
house
and
at
hadj
and
wondered
if
it
would
be
foolish
to
enter
what
is
it
she
asked
again
but
he
only
replied
madame
will
see
and
struck
his
flat
hand
upon
the
door
it
was
opened
a
little
way
and
a
broad
face
covered
with
little
humps
and
dents
showed
the
thick
lips
parted
and
muttering
quickly
then
the
face
was
withdrawn
the
door
opened
wider
and
hadj
beckoned
to
domini
to
go
in
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
she
did
so
and
found
herself
in
a
small
interior
court
with
a
tiled
floor
pillars
and
high
up
a
gallery
of
carved
wood
from
which
doubtless
opened
in
the
court
upon
cushions
were
seated
four
men
with
bare
arms
and
legs
and
long
matted
hair
before
a
brazier
from
which
rose
a
sharply
pungent
perfume
two
of
these
men
were
very
young
with
pale
ascetic
faces
and
weary
eyes
they
looked
like
young
priests
of
the
sahara
at
a
short
distance
upon
a
red
pillow
sat
a
tiny
boy
of
about
three
years
old
dressed
in
yellow
and
green
when
domini
and
hadj
came
into
the
court
no
one
looked
at
them
except
the
child
who
stared
with
solemn
eyes
slightly
shifting
on
the
pillow
hadj
beckoned
to
domini
to
seat
herself
upon
some
rugs
between
the
pillars
sat
down
beside
her
and
began
to
make
a
cigarette
complete
silence
prevailed
the
four
men
stared
at
the
brazier
holding
their
nostrils
over
the
incense
fumes
which
rose
from
it
in
airy
spirals
the
child
continued
to
stare
at
domini
hadj
lit
his
cigarette
and
time
rolled
on
domini
had
desired
violence
and
had
been
conveyed
into
a
dumbness
of
mystery
that
fell
upon
her
turmoil
of
spirit
like
a
blow
what
struck
her
as
especially
strange
and
unnatural
was
the
fact
that
the
men
with
whom
she
was
sitting
in
the
dim
court
of
this
lonely
house
had
not
looked
at
her
did
not
appear
to
know
that
she
was
there
hadj
had
caught
the
aroma
of
their
meditations
with
the
perfume
of
the
incense
for
his
eyes
had
lost
their
mischief
and
become
gloomily
profound
as
if
they
stared
on
bygone
centuries
or
watched
a
future
even
the
child
began
to
look
elderly
and
worn
as
with
fastings
and
with
watchings
as
the
fumes
perpetually
ascended
from
the
coals
of
the
brazier
the
sharp
smell
of
the
perfume
grew
stronger
there
was
in
it
something
provocative
and
exciting
that
was
like
a
sound
and
domini
marvelled
that
the
four
men
who
crouched
over
it
and
drank
it
in
perpetually
could
be
unaffected
by
its
influence
when
she
who
was
at
some
distance
from
it
felt
dawning
on
her
desires
of
movement
of
action
almost
a
physical
necessity
to
get
up
and
do
something
extraordinary
absurd
or
passionate
such
as
she
had
never
done
or
dreamed
of
till
this
moment
a
low
growl
like
that
of
a
wild
beast
broke
the
silence
domini
did
not
know
at
first
whence
it
came
she
stared
at
the
four
men
but
they
were
all
gazing
vacantly
into
the
brazier
their
naked
arms
dropping
to
the
floor
she
glanced
at
hadj
he
was
delicately
taking
a
cigarette
paper
from
a
little
case
the
child
no
it
was
absurd
even
to
think
of
a
child
emitting
such
a
sound
someone
growled
again
more
fiercely
and
this
time
domini
saw
that
it
was
the
palest
of
the
youths
he
shook
back
his
long
hair
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
bound
and
moving
into
the
centre
of
the
court
gazed
ferociously
at
his
companions
as
if
in
obedience
to
the
glance
two
of
them
stretched
their
arms
backwards
found
two
tomtoms
and
began
to
beat
them
loudly
and
monotonously
the
young
ascetic
bowed
to
the
tomtoms
dropping
his
lower
jaw
and
jumping
on
his
bare
feet
he
bowed
again
as
if
saluting
a
fetish
and
again
and
again
ceaselessly
he
bowed
to
the
tomtoms
always
jumping
softly
from
the
pavement
his
long
hair
fell
over
his
face
and
back
upon
his
shoulders
with
a
monotonous
regularity
that
imitated
the
tomtoms
as
if
he
strove
to
mould
his
life
in
accord
with
the
fetish
to
which
he
offered
adoration
flecks
of
foam
appeared
upon
his
lips
and
the
asceticism
in
his
eyes
changed
to
a
bestial
glare
his
whole
body
was
involved
in
a
long
and
undulation
above
which
his
hair
flew
to
and
fro
presently
the
second
youth
moving
reverently
like
a
priest
about
the
altar
stole
to
a
corner
and
returned
with
a
large
and
curved
sheet
of
glass
without
looking
at
domini
he
came
to
her
and
placed
it
in
her
hands
when
the
dancer
saw
the
glass
he
stood
still
growled
again
long
and
furiously
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
domini
licked
his
lips
then
abruptly
thrusting
forward
his
face
set
his
teeth
in
the
sheet
of
glass
bit
a
large
piece
off
crunched
it
up
with
a
loud
noise
swallowed
it
with
a
gulp
and
growled
for
more
she
fed
him
again
while
the
tomtoms
went
on
roaring
and
the
child
in
its
red
pillow
watched
with
its
weary
eyes
and
when
he
was
full
fed
only
a
fragment
of
glass
remained
between
her
fingers
he
fell
upon
the
ground
and
lay
like
one
in
a
trance
then
the
second
youth
bowed
to
the
tomtoms
leaping
gently
on
the
pavement
foamed
at
the
mouth
growled
snuffed
up
the
incense
fumes
shook
his
long
mane
and
placed
his
naked
feet
in
the
coals
of
the
brazier
he
plucked
out
a
coal
and
rolled
his
tongue
round
it
he
placed
red
coals
under
his
bare
armpits
and
kept
them
there
pressing
his
arms
against
his
sides
he
held
a
coal
like
a
monocle
in
his
eye
socket
against
his
eye
and
all
the
time
he
leaped
and
bowed
and
foamed
undulating
his
body
like
a
snake
the
child
looked
on
with
a
still
gravity
and
the
tomtoms
never
ceased
from
the
gallery
above
painted
faces
peered
down
but
domini
did
not
see
them
her
attention
was
taken
captive
by
the
young
priests
of
the
sahara
for
so
she
called
them
in
her
mind
realising
that
there
were
religious
fanatics
whose
devotion
seemed
to
lift
them
above
the
ordinary
dangers
to
the
body
one
of
the
musicians
now
took
his
turn
throwing
his
tomtom
to
the
eater
of
glass
who
had
wakened
from
his
trance
he
bowed
and
leaped
thrust
spikes
behind
his
eyes
through
his
cheeks
his
lips
his
arms
drove
a
long
nail
into
his
head
with
a
wooden
hammer
stood
upon
the
sharp
edge
of
an
upturned
sword
blade
with
the
spikes
protruding
from
his
face
in
all
directions
and
his
eyes
bulging
out
from
them
like
balls
he
spun
in
a
maze
of
hair
barking
like
a
dog
the
child
regarded
him
with
a
still
attention
and
the
incense
fumes
were
cloudy
in
the
court
then
the
last
of
the
four
men
sprang
up
in
the
midst
of
a
more
passionate
uproar
from
the
tomtoms
he
wore
a
filthy
burnous
and
with
a
shriek
he
plunged
his
hand
into
its
hood
and
threw
some
squirming
things
upon
the
floor
they
began
to
run
rearing
stiff
tails
into
the
air
he
sank
down
blew
upon
them
caught
them
letting
them
set
their
tail
weapons
in
his
fingers
and
lifting
them
thus
imbedded
high
above
the
floor
then
again
he
put
them
down
breathed
upon
each
one
drew
a
circle
round
each
with
his
forefinger
his
face
had
suddenly
become
intense
hypnotic
the
scorpions
as
if
mesmerised
remained
utterly
still
each
in
its
place
within
its
imaginary
circle
that
had
become
a
cage
and
their
master
bowed
to
the
fetish
of
the
tomtoms
leaped
grinned
and
bowed
again
undulating
his
body
in
a
maze
of
hair
domini
felt
as
if
she
like
the
scorpions
had
been
mesmerised
she
too
was
surely
bound
in
a
circle
breathed
upon
by
some
arrogant
breath
of
fanaticism
commanded
by
some
horrid
power
she
looked
at
the
scorpions
and
felt
a
sort
of
pity
for
them
from
time
to
time
the
bowing
fanatic
glanced
at
them
through
his
hair
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
licked
his
lips
shook
his
shoulders
and
uttered
a
long
howl
thrilling
with
the
note
of
greed
the
tomtoms
pulsed
faster
and
faster
louder
and
louder
and
all
the
men
began
to
sing
a
fierce
chant
the
song
surely
of
desert
souls
driven
crazy
by
religion
one
of
the
scorpions
moved
slightly
reared
its
tail
began
to
run
instantly
as
if
at
a
signal
the
dancer
fell
upon
his
knees
bent
down
his
head
seized
it
in
his
teeth
munched
it
and
swallowed
it
at
the
same
moment
with
the
uproar
of
the
tomtoms
there
mingled
a
loud
knocking
on
the
door
hadj
s
lips
curled
back
from
his
pointed
teeth
and
he
looked
dangerous
it
is
batouch
he
snarled
domini
got
up
without
a
word
turning
her
back
upon
the
court
she
made
her
way
out
still
hearing
the
howl
of
the
the
roar
of
the
tomtoms
and
the
knocking
on
the
door
hadj
followed
her
quickly
protesting
at
the
door
was
the
man
with
the
pitted
white
face
and
the
thick
lips
when
he
saw
her
he
held
out
his
hand
she
gave
him
some
money
he
opened
the
door
and
she
came
out
into
the
night
by
the
triple
palm
tree
batouch
stood
there
looking
furious
with
the
bridles
of
two
horses
across
his
arm
he
began
to
speak
in
arabic
to
hadj
but
she
stopped
him
with
an
imperious
gesture
gave
hadj
his
fee
and
in
a
moment
was
in
the
saddle
and
cantering
away
into
the
dark
she
heard
the
gallop
of
batouch
s
horse
coming
up
behind
her
and
turned
her
head
batouch
she
said
you
are
the
smartest
she
used
the
word
arab
here
do
you
know
what
is
the
fashion
in
london
when
a
lady
rides
out
with
the
attendant
who
guards
her
the
really
smart
thing
to
do
she
was
playing
on
his
vanity
he
responded
with
a
ready
smile
no
the
attendant
rides
at
a
short
distance
behind
her
so
that
no
one
can
come
up
near
her
without
his
batouch
fell
back
and
domini
cantered
on
congratulating
herself
on
the
success
of
her
expedient
she
passed
through
the
village
full
of
strolling
white
figures
lights
and
the
sound
of
music
and
was
soon
at
the
end
of
the
long
straight
road
that
was
significant
to
her
as
no
other
road
had
ever
been
each
time
she
saw
it
stretching
on
till
it
was
lost
in
the
serried
masses
of
the
palms
her
imagination
was
stirred
by
a
longing
to
wander
through
barbaric
lands
by
a
nomad
feeling
that
was
almost
irresistible
this
road
was
a
track
of
fate
to
her
when
she
was
on
it
she
had
a
strange
sensation
as
if
she
changed
developed
drew
near
to
some
ideal
it
influenced
her
as
one
person
may
influence
another
now
for
the
first
time
she
was
on
it
in
the
night
riding
on
the
crowded
shadows
of
its
palms
she
drew
rein
and
went
more
slowly
she
had
a
desire
to
be
noiseless
in
the
obscurity
the
thickets
of
the
palms
looked
more
exotic
than
in
the
light
of
day
there
was
no
motion
in
them
each
tree
stood
like
a
delicately
carven
thing
silhouetted
against
the
remote
purple
of
the
void
in
the
profound
firmament
the
stars
burned
with
a
tremulous
ardour
they
never
show
in
northern
skies
the
mystery
of
this
african
night
rose
not
from
vaporous
veils
and
the
long
movement
of
winds
but
was
breathed
out
by
clearness
brightness
stillness
it
was
the
deepest
of
all
mystery
the
mystery
of
vastness
and
of
peace
no
one
was
on
the
road
the
sound
of
the
horse
s
feet
were
sharply
distinct
in
the
night
on
all
sides
but
far
off
the
guard
dogs
were
barking
by
the
hidden
homes
of
men
the
air
was
warm
as
in
a
hothouse
but
light
and
faintly
impregnated
with
perfume
shed
surely
by
the
mystical
garments
of
night
as
she
glided
on
with
domini
towards
the
desert
from
the
blackness
of
the
palms
there
came
sometimes
thin
notes
of
the
birds
of
night
the
whizzing
noise
of
insects
the
glassy
pipe
of
a
frog
in
the
reeds
by
a
pool
behind
a
hot
brown
wall
she
rode
through
one
of
the
villages
of
old
silent
unlighted
with
empty
streets
and
closed
cafes
maures
touched
her
horse
with
the
whip
and
cantered
on
at
a
quicker
pace
as
she
drew
near
to
the
desert
her
desire
to
be
in
it
increased
there
was
some
coarse
grass
here
the
palm
trees
grew
less
thickly
she
heard
more
clearly
the
barking
of
the
kabyle
dogs
and
knew
that
tents
were
not
far
off
now
between
the
trunks
of
the
trees
she
saw
the
twinkling
of
distant
fires
and
the
sound
of
running
water
fell
on
her
ears
mingling
with
the
persistent
noise
of
the
insects
and
the
faint
cries
of
the
birds
and
frogs
in
front
where
the
road
came
out
from
the
shadows
of
the
last
trees
lay
a
vast
dimness
not
wholly
unlike
another
starless
sky
stretched
beneath
the
starry
sky
in
which
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
she
set
her
horse
at
a
gallop
and
came
into
the
desert
rushing
through
the
dark
madame
madame
batouch
s
voice
was
calling
her
she
galloped
faster
like
one
in
flight
her
horse
s
feet
padded
over
sand
almost
as
softly
as
a
camel
s
the
vast
dimness
was
surely
coming
to
meet
her
to
take
her
to
itself
in
the
night
but
suddenly
batouch
rode
furiously
up
beside
her
his
burnous
flying
out
behind
him
over
his
red
saddle
madame
we
must
not
go
further
we
must
keep
near
the
why
it
is
not
safe
at
night
in
the
desert
and
besides
his
horse
plunged
and
nearly
rocketed
against
hers
she
pulled
in
his
company
took
away
her
desire
to
keep
on
besides
leaning
over
his
saddle
peak
he
said
mysteriously
besides
madame
someone
has
been
following
us
all
the
way
from
who
a
horseman
i
have
heard
the
beat
of
the
hoofs
on
the
hard
road
once
i
stopped
and
turned
but
i
could
see
nothing
and
then
i
could
hear
nothing
he
too
had
stopped
but
when
i
rode
on
again
soon
i
heard
him
once
more
someone
found
out
we
were
going
and
has
come
after
she
looked
back
into
the
violet
night
without
speaking
she
heard
no
sound
of
a
horse
saw
nothing
but
the
dim
track
and
the
faint
shadowy
blackness
where
the
palms
began
then
she
put
her
hand
into
the
pocket
of
her
saddle
and
silently
held
up
a
tiny
revolver
i
know
but
there
might
be
more
than
one
i
am
not
afraid
but
if
anything
happens
to
madame
no
one
will
ever
take
me
as
a
guide
any
she
smiled
for
a
moment
but
the
smile
died
away
and
again
she
looked
into
the
night
she
was
not
afraid
physically
but
she
was
conscious
of
a
certain
uneasiness
the
day
had
been
long
and
troubled
and
had
left
its
mark
upon
her
restlessness
had
driven
her
forth
into
the
darkness
and
behind
the
restlessness
there
was
a
hint
of
the
terror
of
which
she
had
been
aware
when
she
was
left
alone
in
the
was
it
not
that
vague
terror
which
shaking
the
restlessness
had
sent
her
to
the
white
house
by
the
triple
palm
tree
had
brought
her
now
to
the
desert
she
asked
herself
while
she
listened
and
the
hidden
horseman
of
whom
batouch
had
spoken
became
in
her
imagination
one
with
the
legendary
victims
of
fate
with
the
jew
by
the
cross
roads
the
mariner
beating
ever
about
the
shores
of
the
world
the
climber
in
the
witches
sabbath
the
phantom
arab
in
the
sand
still
holding
her
revolver
she
turned
her
horse
and
rode
slowly
towards
the
distant
fires
from
which
came
the
barking
of
the
dogs
at
some
hundreds
of
yards
from
them
she
paused
i
shall
stay
here
she
said
to
batouch
where
does
the
moon
rise
he
stretched
his
arm
towards
the
desert
which
sloped
gently
almost
imperceptibly
towards
the
east
ride
back
a
little
way
towards
the
oasis
the
horseman
was
behind
us
if
he
is
still
following
you
will
meet
him
don
t
go
far
do
as
i
tell
you
with
obvious
reluctance
he
obeyed
her
she
saw
him
pull
up
his
horse
at
a
distance
where
he
had
her
just
in
sight
then
she
turned
so
that
she
could
not
see
him
and
looked
towards
the
desert
and
the
east
the
revolver
seemed
unnaturally
heavy
in
her
hand
she
glanced
at
it
for
a
moment
and
listened
with
intensity
for
the
beat
of
horse
s
hoofs
and
her
wakeful
imagination
created
a
sound
that
was
in
her
ears
with
it
she
heard
a
gallop
that
was
spectral
as
the
gallop
of
the
black
horses
which
carried
mephistopheles
and
faust
to
the
abyss
it
died
away
almost
at
once
and
she
knew
it
for
an
imagination
she
was
peopling
the
desert
with
phantoms
even
the
fires
of
the
nomads
were
as
the
fires
that
flicker
in
an
abode
of
witches
the
shadows
that
passed
before
them
were
as
goblins
that
had
come
up
out
of
the
sand
to
hold
revel
in
the
moonlight
were
they
too
waiting
for
a
signal
from
the
sky
at
the
thought
of
the
moon
she
drew
up
the
reins
that
had
been
lying
loosely
on
her
horse
s
neck
and
rode
some
paces
forward
and
away
from
the
fires
still
holding
the
revolver
in
her
hand
of
what
use
would
it
be
against
the
spectres
of
the
sahara
the
jew
would
face
it
without
fear
why
not
the
horseman
of
batouch
she
dropped
it
into
the
pocket
of
the
saddle
far
away
in
the
east
the
darkness
of
the
sky
was
slowly
fading
into
a
luminous
mystery
that
rose
from
the
underworld
a
mystery
that
at
first
was
faint
and
tremulous
pale
with
a
pallor
of
silver
and
primrose
but
that
deepened
slowly
into
a
live
and
ardent
gold
against
which
a
group
of
three
palm
trees
detached
themselves
from
the
desert
like
messengers
sent
forth
by
it
to
give
a
salutation
to
the
moon
they
were
jet
black
against
the
gold
distinct
though
very
distant
the
night
and
the
vast
plain
from
which
they
rose
lent
them
a
significance
that
was
unearthly
their
long
thin
stems
and
drooping
feathery
leaves
were
living
and
pathetic
as
the
night
thoughts
of
a
woman
who
has
suffered
but
who
turns
with
a
gesture
of
longing
that
will
not
be
denied
to
the
luminance
that
dwells
at
the
heart
of
the
world
and
those
black
palms
against
the
gold
that
stillness
of
darkness
and
light
in
immensity
banished
domini
s
faint
sense
of
horror
the
spectres
faded
away
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
palms
now
all
the
notes
of
the
living
things
that
do
not
sleep
by
night
but
make
music
by
reedy
pools
in
underwood
among
the
blades
of
grass
and
along
the
banks
of
streams
were
audible
to
her
again
filling
her
mind
with
the
mystery
of
existence
the
glassy
note
of
the
frogs
was
like
a
falling
of
something
small
and
pointed
upon
a
sheet
of
crystal
the
whirs
of
the
insects
suggested
a
ceaselessly
active
mentality
the
faint
cries
of
the
birds
dropped
down
like
jewels
slipping
from
the
trees
and
suddenly
she
felt
that
she
was
as
nothing
in
the
vastness
and
the
complication
of
the
night
even
the
passion
that
she
knew
lay
like
a
dark
and
silent
flood
within
her
soul
a
flood
that
once
released
from
its
boundaries
had
surely
the
power
to
rush
irresistibly
forward
to
submerge
old
landmarks
and
change
the
face
of
a
world
even
that
seemed
to
lose
its
depth
for
a
moment
to
be
shallow
as
the
first
ripple
of
a
tide
upon
the
sand
and
she
forgot
that
the
first
ripple
has
all
the
ocean
behind
it
red
deepened
and
glowed
in
the
gold
behind
the
three
palms
and
the
upper
rim
of
the
round
moon
red
too
as
blood
crept
about
the
desert
domini
leaning
forward
with
one
hand
upon
her
horse
s
warm
neck
watched
until
the
full
circle
was
poised
for
a
moment
on
the
horizon
holding
the
palms
in
its
frame
of
fire
she
had
never
seen
a
moon
look
so
immense
and
so
vivid
as
this
moon
that
came
up
into
the
night
like
a
portent
fierce
yet
serene
moon
of
a
barbaric
world
such
as
might
have
shone
upon
herod
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
baptist
in
his
dungeon
or
upon
the
wife
of
pilate
when
in
a
dream
she
was
troubled
it
suggested
to
her
the
powerful
watcher
of
tragic
events
fraught
with
long
chains
of
consequence
that
would
last
on
through
centuries
as
it
turned
its
gaze
upon
the
desert
upon
the
palms
upon
her
and
leaning
upon
her
horse
s
neck
she
too
like
pilate
s
wife
fell
into
a
sort
of
strange
and
troubled
dream
for
a
moment
full
of
strong
yet
ghastly
light
and
of
shapes
that
flitted
across
a
background
of
fire
in
it
she
saw
the
priest
with
a
fanatical
look
of
warning
in
his
eyes
count
anteoni
beneath
the
trees
of
his
garden
the
in
his
dark
bazaar
irena
with
her
long
throat
exposed
and
her
thin
arms
drooping
the
spreading
forth
his
hands
androvsky
galloping
upon
a
horse
as
if
pursued
this
last
vision
returned
again
and
again
as
the
moon
rose
a
stream
of
light
that
seemed
tragic
fell
across
the
desert
and
was
woven
mysteriously
into
the
light
of
her
waking
dream
the
three
palms
looked
larger
she
fancied
that
she
saw
them
growing
becoming
monstrous
as
they
stood
in
the
very
centre
of
the
path
of
the
nocturnal
glory
and
suddenly
she
remembered
her
thought
when
she
sat
with
androvsky
in
the
garden
that
feeling
grew
in
human
hearts
like
palms
rising
in
the
desert
but
these
palms
were
tragic
and
aspired
towards
the
moon
suddenly
she
was
seized
with
a
fear
of
feeling
of
the
growth
of
an
intense
sensation
within
her
and
realised
with
an
almost
feverish
vividness
the
impotence
of
a
soul
caught
in
the
grip
of
a
great
passion
swayed
hither
and
thither
led
into
strange
paths
along
the
edges
perhaps
into
depths
of
immeasurable
abysses
she
had
said
to
androvsky
that
she
would
rather
be
the
centre
of
a
world
tragedy
than
die
without
having
felt
to
the
uttermost
even
if
it
were
sorrow
was
that
not
the
speech
of
a
mad
woman
or
at
least
of
a
woman
who
was
so
ignorant
of
the
life
of
feeling
that
her
words
were
idle
and
ridiculous
again
she
felt
desperately
that
she
did
not
know
herself
and
this
lack
of
the
most
essential
of
all
knowledge
reduced
her
for
a
moment
to
a
bitterness
of
despair
that
seemed
worse
than
the
bitterness
of
death
the
vastness
of
the
desert
appalled
her
the
red
moon
held
within
its
circle
all
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
of
life
of
ideals
she
shivered
in
the
saddle
her
nature
seemed
to
shrink
and
quiver
and
a
cry
for
protection
rose
within
her
the
cry
of
the
woman
who
can
not
face
life
alone
who
must
find
a
protector
and
who
must
cling
to
a
strong
arm
who
needs
man
as
the
world
needs
god
then
again
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
saw
androvsky
galloping
upon
a
horse
as
if
pursued
moved
by
a
desire
to
do
something
to
combat
this
strange
despair
born
of
the
moonrise
and
the
night
she
sat
erect
in
her
saddle
and
resolutely
looked
at
the
desert
striving
to
get
away
from
herself
in
a
hard
contemplation
of
the
details
that
surrounded
her
the
outward
things
that
were
coming
each
moment
into
clearer
view
she
gazed
steadily
towards
the
palms
that
sharply
cut
the
moonlight
as
she
did
so
something
black
moved
away
from
them
as
if
it
had
been
part
of
them
and
now
detached
itself
with
the
intention
of
approaching
her
along
the
track
at
first
it
was
merely
a
moving
blot
formless
and
small
but
as
it
drew
nearer
she
saw
that
it
was
a
horseman
riding
slowly
perhaps
stealthily
across
the
sand
she
glanced
behind
her
and
saw
batouch
not
far
off
and
the
fires
of
the
nomads
then
she
turned
again
to
watch
the
horseman
he
came
steadily
forward
madame
it
was
the
voice
of
batouch
stay
where
you
are
she
called
out
to
him
she
heard
the
soft
sound
of
the
horse
s
feet
and
could
see
the
attitude
of
its
rider
he
was
leaning
forward
as
if
searching
the
night
she
rode
to
meet
him
and
they
came
to
each
other
in
the
path
of
the
light
she
had
thought
tragic
you
followed
me
i
can
not
see
you
go
out
alone
into
the
desert
at
night
androvsky
replied
but
you
have
no
right
to
follow
i
can
not
let
harm
come
to
you
she
was
silent
a
moment
before
she
had
been
longing
for
a
protector
one
had
come
to
her
the
man
whom
she
had
been
setting
with
those
legendary
figures
who
have
saddened
and
appalled
the
imagination
of
men
she
looked
at
the
dark
figure
of
androvsky
leaning
forward
on
the
horse
whose
feet
were
set
on
the
path
of
the
moon
and
she
did
not
know
whether
she
felt
confidence
in
him
or
fear
of
him
all
that
the
priest
had
said
rose
up
in
her
mind
all
that
count
anteoni
had
hinted
and
that
had
been
visible
in
the
face
of
the
this
man
had
followed
her
into
the
night
as
a
guardian
did
she
need
someone
something
to
guard
her
from
him
a
faint
horror
was
still
upon
her
perhaps
he
knew
it
and
resented
it
for
he
drew
himself
upright
on
his
horse
and
spoke
again
with
a
decision
that
was
rare
in
him
let
me
send
batouch
back
to
why
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
that
was
full
of
hesitation
you
do
not
need
him
he
was
looking
at
her
with
a
defiant
a
challenging
expression
that
was
his
answer
to
her
expression
of
vague
distrust
and
apprehension
how
do
you
know
that
he
did
not
answer
the
question
but
only
said
it
is
better
here
without
him
may
i
send
him
away
madame
she
bent
her
head
androvsky
rode
off
and
she
saw
him
speaking
to
batouch
who
shook
his
head
as
if
in
contradiction
batouch
she
called
out
you
can
ride
back
to
we
shall
follow
the
poet
cantered
forward
madame
it
is
not
the
sound
of
his
voice
made
domini
suddenly
know
what
she
had
not
been
sure
of
before
that
she
wished
to
be
alone
with
androvsky
go
batouch
she
said
i
tell
you
to
batouch
turned
his
horse
without
a
word
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
of
the
distant
palms
when
they
were
alone
together
domini
and
androvsky
sat
silent
on
their
horses
for
some
minutes
their
faces
were
turned
towards
the
desert
which
was
now
luminous
beneath
the
moon
its
loneliness
was
overpowering
in
the
night
and
made
speech
at
first
an
impossibility
and
even
thought
difficult
at
last
androvsky
said
madame
why
did
you
look
at
me
like
that
just
now
as
if
you
as
if
you
hesitated
to
remain
alone
with
me
suddenly
she
resolved
to
tell
him
of
her
oppression
of
the
night
she
felt
as
if
to
do
so
would
relieve
her
of
something
that
was
like
a
pain
at
her
heart
has
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
we
are
strangers
to
each
other
she
said
that
we
know
nothing
of
each
other
s
lives
what
do
you
know
of
me
or
i
of
you
he
shifted
in
his
saddle
and
moved
the
reins
from
one
hand
to
the
other
but
said
nothing
would
it
seem
strange
to
you
if
i
did
hesitate
if
even
now
yes
he
interrupted
violently
it
would
seem
strange
to
why
you
would
rely
on
an
arab
and
not
rely
upon
me
he
said
with
intense
bitterness
i
did
not
say
yet
at
first
you
wished
to
keep
then
batouch
is
my
and
i
perhaps
i
am
nothing
but
a
man
whom
you
distrust
whom
whom
others
tell
you
to
think
ill
i
judge
for
but
if
others
speak
ill
of
me
it
would
not
influence
me
for
she
added
the
last
words
after
a
pause
she
wished
to
be
strictly
truthful
and
she
was
not
sure
that
the
words
of
the
priest
had
made
no
impression
upon
her
for
long
he
repeated
then
he
said
abruptly
the
priest
hates
and
count
anteoni
you
interested
count
anteoni
interested
him
his
voice
sounded
intensely
suspicious
in
the
night
don
t
you
wish
to
interest
anyone
it
seems
to
me
that
to
be
uninteresting
is
to
live
eternally
alone
in
a
sunless
i
wish
i
should
like
to
think
that
i
he
stopped
then
said
with
a
sort
of
ashamed
determination
could
i
ever
interest
you
madame
yes
she
answered
quietly
but
you
would
rather
be
protected
by
an
arab
than
by
me
the
priest
has
i
do
not
seem
to
be
myself
she
said
interrupting
him
perhaps
there
is
some
physical
reason
i
got
up
very
early
and
don
t
you
ever
feel
oppressed
suspicious
doubtful
of
life
people
yourself
everything
without
apparent
reason
don
t
you
know
what
it
is
to
have
nightmare
without
sleeping
i
but
you
are
i
have
felt
i
do
feel
as
if
there
were
tragedy
near
me
perhaps
coming
towards
me
she
said
simply
and
i
am
oppressed
i
am
almost
when
she
had
said
it
she
felt
happier
as
if
a
burden
she
carried
were
suddenly
lighter
as
he
did
not
speak
she
glanced
at
him
the
moon
rays
lit
up
his
face
it
looked
ghastly
drawn
and
old
so
changed
that
she
scarcely
recognised
it
and
felt
for
a
moment
as
if
she
were
with
a
stranger
she
looked
away
quickly
wondering
if
what
she
had
seen
was
merely
some
strange
effect
of
the
moon
or
whether
androvsky
was
really
altered
for
a
moment
by
the
action
of
some
terrible
grief
one
of
those
sudden
sorrows
that
rush
upon
a
man
from
the
hidden
depths
of
his
nature
and
tear
his
soul
till
his
whole
being
is
lacerated
and
he
feels
as
if
his
soul
were
flesh
and
were
streaming
with
the
blood
from
mortal
wounds
the
silence
between
them
was
long
in
it
she
presently
heard
a
reiterated
noise
that
sounded
like
struggle
and
pain
made
audible
it
was
androvsky
s
breathing
in
the
soft
and
exquisite
air
of
the
desert
he
was
gasping
like
a
man
shut
up
in
a
cellar
she
looked
again
towards
him
startled
as
she
did
so
he
turned
his
horse
sideways
and
rode
away
a
few
paces
then
he
pulled
up
his
horse
he
was
now
merely
a
black
shape
upon
the
moonlight
motionless
and
inaudible
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
this
shape
its
blackness
suggested
to
her
the
blackness
of
a
gulf
her
memory
still
heard
that
sound
of
breathing
or
gasping
heard
it
and
quivered
beneath
it
as
a
person
quivers
seeing
a
helpless
creature
being
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
carried
away
by
an
irresistible
impulse
to
try
to
soothe
this
extremity
of
pain
which
she
was
unable
to
understand
she
rode
up
to
androvsky
when
she
reached
him
she
did
not
know
what
she
had
meant
to
say
or
do
she
felt
suddenly
impotent
and
intrusive
and
even
horribly
shy
but
before
she
had
time
for
speech
or
action
he
turned
to
her
and
said
lifting
up
his
hands
with
the
reins
in
them
and
then
dropping
them
down
heavily
upon
his
horse
s
neck
madame
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
he
stopped
yes
she
said
he
turned
his
head
away
from
her
till
she
could
not
see
his
face
i
am
leaving
she
said
she
did
not
feel
the
horse
under
her
the
reins
in
her
hand
she
did
not
see
the
desert
or
the
moon
though
she
was
looking
at
androvsky
she
no
longer
perceived
him
at
the
sound
of
his
words
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
all
outside
things
she
had
ever
known
had
foundered
like
a
ship
whose
bottom
is
ripped
up
by
a
rock
as
if
with
them
had
foundered
too
all
things
within
herself
thoughts
feelings
even
the
bodily
powers
that
were
of
the
essence
of
her
life
sense
of
taste
smell
hearing
sight
the
capacity
of
movement
and
of
deliberate
repose
nothing
seemed
to
remain
except
the
knowledge
that
she
was
still
alive
and
had
spoken
yes
i
shall
go
his
face
was
still
turned
from
her
and
his
voice
sounded
as
if
it
spoke
to
someone
at
a
distance
someone
who
could
hear
as
man
can
not
hear
she
repeated
she
knew
she
had
spoken
again
but
it
did
not
seem
to
her
as
if
she
had
heard
herself
speak
she
looked
at
her
hands
holding
the
reins
knew
that
she
looked
at
them
yet
felt
as
if
she
were
not
seeing
them
while
she
did
so
the
moonlit
desert
was
surely
flickering
round
her
and
away
to
the
horizon
in
waves
that
were
caused
by
the
disappearance
of
that
ship
which
had
suddenly
foundered
with
all
its
countless
lives
and
she
knew
of
the
movement
of
these
waves
as
the
soul
of
one
of
the
drowned
already
released
from
the
body
might
know
of
the
movement
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
beneath
which
its
body
was
hidden
but
the
soul
was
evidently
nothing
without
the
body
or
at
most
merely
a
continuance
of
power
to
know
that
all
which
had
been
was
no
more
all
which
had
been
was
no
more
at
last
her
mind
began
to
work
again
and
those
words
went
through
it
with
persistence
she
thought
of
the
fascination
of
africa
that
enormous
overpowering
fascination
which
had
taken
possession
of
her
body
and
spirit
what
had
become
of
it
what
had
become
of
the
romance
of
the
palm
gardens
of
the
brown
villages
of
the
red
mountains
of
the
white
town
with
its
lights
its
white
figures
its
throbbing
music
and
the
mystical
attraction
of
the
desert
where
was
it
now
its
voice
that
had
called
her
persistently
was
suddenly
silent
its
hand
that
had
been
laid
upon
her
was
removed
she
looked
at
it
in
the
moonlight
and
it
was
no
longer
the
desert
sand
with
a
soul
in
it
blue
distances
full
of
a
music
of
summons
spaces
peopled
with
spirits
from
the
sun
it
was
only
a
barren
waste
of
matter
arid
featureless
desolate
ghastly
with
the
bones
of
things
that
had
died
she
heard
the
dogs
barking
by
the
tents
of
the
nomads
and
the
noises
of
the
insects
but
still
she
did
not
feel
the
horse
underneath
her
yet
she
was
gradually
recovering
her
powers
and
their
recovery
brought
with
it
sharp
physical
pain
such
as
is
felt
by
a
person
who
has
been
nearly
drowned
and
is
restored
from
unconsciousness
androvsky
turned
round
she
saw
his
eyes
fastened
upon
her
and
instantly
pride
awoke
in
her
and
with
pride
her
whole
self
she
felt
her
horse
under
her
the
reins
in
her
hands
the
stirrup
at
her
foot
she
moved
in
her
saddle
the
blood
tingled
in
her
veins
fiercely
bitterly
as
if
it
had
become
suddenly
acrid
she
felt
as
if
her
face
were
scarlet
as
if
her
whole
body
flushed
and
as
if
the
flush
could
be
seen
by
her
companion
for
a
moment
she
was
clothed
from
head
to
foot
in
a
fiery
garment
of
shame
but
she
faced
androvsky
with
calm
eyes
and
her
lips
smiled
you
are
tired
of
it
she
said
i
never
meant
to
stay
long
he
answered
looking
down
there
is
not
very
much
to
do
here
shall
we
ride
back
to
the
village
now
she
turned
her
horse
and
as
she
did
so
cast
one
more
glance
at
the
three
palm
trees
that
stood
far
out
on
the
path
of
the
moon
they
looked
like
three
malignant
fates
lifting
up
their
hands
in
malediction
for
a
moment
she
shivered
in
the
saddle
then
she
touched
her
horse
with
the
whip
and
turned
her
eyes
away
androvsky
followed
her
and
rode
by
her
side
in
silence
to
gain
the
oasis
they
passed
near
to
the
tents
of
the
nomads
whose
fires
were
dying
out
the
guard
dogs
were
barking
furiously
and
straining
at
the
cords
which
fastened
them
to
the
tent
pegs
by
the
short
hedges
of
brushwood
that
sheltered
the
doors
of
filthy
rags
the
arabs
were
all
within
no
doubt
huddled
up
on
the
ground
asleep
one
tent
was
pitched
alone
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
others
and
under
the
first
palms
of
the
oasis
a
fire
smouldered
before
it
casting
a
flickering
gleam
of
light
upon
something
dark
which
lay
upon
the
ground
between
it
and
the
tent
tied
to
the
tent
was
a
large
white
dog
which
was
not
barking
but
which
was
howling
as
if
in
agony
of
fear
before
domini
and
androvsky
drew
near
to
this
tent
the
howling
of
the
dog
reached
them
and
startled
them
there
was
in
it
a
note
that
seemed
humanly
expressive
as
if
it
were
a
person
trying
to
scream
out
words
but
unable
to
from
horror
both
of
them
instinctively
pulled
up
their
horses
listened
then
rode
forward
when
they
reached
the
tent
they
saw
the
dark
thing
lying
by
the
fire
what
is
it
domini
whispered
an
arab
asleep
i
suppose
androvsky
answered
staring
at
the
motionless
object
but
the
dog
she
looked
at
the
white
shape
leaping
frantically
against
the
tent
are
you
sure
it
must
be
look
it
is
wrapped
in
rags
and
the
head
is
i
don
t
she
stared
at
it
the
howling
of
the
dog
grew
louder
as
if
it
were
straining
every
nerve
to
tell
them
something
dreadful
do
you
mind
getting
off
and
seeing
what
it
is
i
ll
hold
the
he
swung
himself
out
of
the
saddle
she
caught
his
rein
and
watched
him
go
forward
to
the
thing
that
lay
by
the
fire
bend
down
over
it
touch
it
recoil
from
it
then
as
if
with
a
determined
effort
kneel
down
beside
it
on
the
ground
and
take
the
rags
that
covered
it
in
his
hands
after
a
moment
of
contemplation
of
what
they
had
hidden
he
dropped
the
rags
or
rather
threw
them
from
him
with
a
violent
gesture
got
up
and
came
back
to
domini
and
looked
at
her
without
speaking
she
bent
down
i
ll
tell
you
she
said
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
is
it
s
a
dead
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
dark
thing
lying
by
the
fire
was
herself
yes
he
said
it
s
a
woman
who
has
been
poor
woman
she
said
poor
poor
woman
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
said
it
of
herself
chapter
xv
lying
in
bed
in
the
dark
that
night
domini
heard
the
church
clock
chime
the
hours
she
was
not
restless
though
she
was
wakeful
indeed
she
felt
like
a
woman
to
whom
an
injection
of
morphia
had
been
administered
as
if
she
never
wished
to
move
again
she
lay
there
counting
the
minutes
that
made
the
passing
hours
counting
them
calmly
with
an
inexorable
and
almost
cold
the
process
presently
became
mechanical
and
she
was
able
at
the
same
time
to
dwell
upon
the
events
that
had
followed
upon
the
discovery
of
the
murdered
woman
by
the
tent
androvsky
s
pulling
aside
of
the
door
of
the
tent
to
find
it
empty
their
short
ride
to
the
encampment
close
by
their
rousing
up
of
the
sleeping
arabs
within
filthy
nomads
clothed
in
patched
garments
unveiled
women
with
wrinkled
staring
faces
and
huge
plaits
of
false
hair
and
amulets
from
the
tents
the
strange
figures
had
streamed
forth
into
the
light
of
the
moon
and
the
fading
fires
gesticulating
talking
loudly
furiously
in
an
uncouth
language
that
was
unintelligible
to
her
led
by
androvsky
they
had
come
to
the
corpse
while
the
air
was
rent
by
the
frantic
barking
of
all
the
guard
dogs
and
the
howling
of
the
dog
that
had
been
a
witness
of
the
murder
then
in
the
night
had
risen
the
shrill
wailing
of
the
women
a
wailing
that
seemed
to
pierce
the
stars
and
shudder
out
to
the
remotest
confines
of
the
desert
and
in
the
cold
white
radiance
of
the
moon
a
savage
vision
of
grief
had
been
presented
to
her
eyes
naked
arms
gesticulating
as
if
they
strove
to
summon
vengeance
from
heaven
hands
casting
earth
upon
the
heads
from
which
dangled
fatma
hands
chains
of
tarnished
silver
and
lumps
of
coral
that
reminded
her
of
congealed
blood
bodies
that
swayed
and
writhed
as
if
stricken
with
convulsions
or
rent
by
seven
devils
she
remembered
how
strange
had
seemed
to
her
the
vast
calm
the
vast
silence
that
encompassed
this
noisy
outburst
of
humanity
how
inflexible
had
looked
the
enormous
moon
how
unsympathetic
the
brightly
shining
stars
how
feverish
and
irritable
the
flickering
illumination
of
the
flames
that
spurted
up
and
fainted
away
like
things
still
living
but
in
the
agonies
of
death
then
had
followed
her
silent
ride
back
to
with
androvsky
along
the
straight
road
which
had
always
fascinated
her
spirit
of
adventure
they
had
ridden
slowly
without
looking
at
each
other
without
exchanging
a
word
she
had
felt
dry
and
weary
like
an
old
woman
who
had
passed
through
a
long
life
of
suffering
and
emerged
into
a
region
where
any
acute
feeling
is
unable
to
exist
as
at
a
certain
altitude
from
the
earth
human
life
can
no
longer
exist
the
beat
of
the
horses
hoofs
upon
the
road
had
sounded
hard
as
her
heart
felt
cold
as
the
temperature
of
her
mind
her
body
which
usually
swayed
to
her
horse
s
slightest
movement
was
rigid
in
the
saddle
she
recollected
that
once
when
her
horse
stumbled
she
had
thrilled
with
an
abrupt
anger
that
was
almost
ferocious
and
had
lifted
her
whip
to
lash
it
but
the
hand
had
slipped
down
nervelessly
and
she
had
fallen
again
into
her
frigid
reverie
when
they
reached
the
hotel
she
had
dropped
to
the
ground
heavily
and
heavily
had
ascended
the
steps
of
the
verandah
followed
by
androvsky
without
turning
to
him
or
bidding
him
she
had
gone
to
her
room
she
had
not
acted
with
intentional
rudeness
or
indifference
indeed
she
had
felt
incapable
of
an
intention
simply
she
had
forgotten
for
the
first
time
perhaps
in
her
life
an
ordinary
act
of
courtesy
as
an
old
person
sometimes
forgets
you
are
there
and
withdraws
into
himself
androvsky
had
said
nothing
had
not
tried
to
attract
her
attention
to
himself
she
had
heard
his
steps
die
away
on
the
verandah
then
mechanically
she
had
undressed
and
got
into
bed
where
she
was
now
mechanically
counting
the
passing
moments
presently
she
became
aware
of
her
own
stillness
and
connected
it
with
the
stillness
of
the
dead
woman
by
the
tent
she
lay
as
it
were
watching
her
own
corpse
as
a
catholic
keeps
vigil
beside
a
body
that
has
not
yet
been
put
into
the
grave
but
in
this
chamber
of
death
there
were
no
flowers
no
lighted
candles
no
lips
that
moved
in
prayer
she
had
gone
to
bed
without
praying
she
remembered
that
now
but
with
indifference
dead
people
do
not
pray
the
living
pray
for
them
but
even
the
watcher
could
not
pray
another
hour
struck
in
the
belfry
of
the
church
she
listened
to
the
chime
and
left
off
counting
the
moments
and
this
act
of
cessation
made
more
perfect
the
peace
of
the
dead
woman
when
the
sun
rose
her
sensation
of
death
passed
away
leaving
behind
it
however
a
lethargy
of
mind
and
body
such
as
she
had
never
known
before
the
previous
night
suzanne
coming
in
to
call
her
exclaimed
mam
selle
is
ill
no
why
should
i
be
ill
mam
selle
looks
so
strange
the
maid
said
regarding
her
with
round
and
curious
eyes
as
if
she
hesitated
give
me
my
tea
domini
said
when
she
was
drinking
it
she
asked
do
you
know
at
what
time
the
train
leaves
the
passenger
train
yes
mam
selle
there
is
only
one
in
the
day
it
goes
soon
after
twelve
monsieur
helmuth
told
oh

white
linen

i

yes
mam
no
not
that
any
other
gown
is
it
to
be
hot
very
hot
mam
selle
there
is
not
a
cloud
in
the
how
strange
domini
said
in
a
low
voice
that
suzanne
did
not
hear
when
she
was
up
and
dressed
she
said
i
am
going
out
to
count
anteoni
s
garden
i
think
i
ll
yes
i
ll
take
a
book
with
she
went
into
her
little
salon
and
looked
at
the
volumes
scattered
about
there
some
books
of
devotion
travel
books
on
sport
rossetti
s
and
newman
s
poems
some
french
novels
and
the
novels
of
jane
austen
of
which
oddly
considering
her
nature
she
was
very
fond
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
they
struck
her
as
shrivelled
petty
chronicles
of
shrivelled
bloodless
artificial
lives
she
turned
back
into
her
bedroom
took
up
the
little
white
volume
of
the
which
lay
always
near
her
bed
and
went
out
into
the
verandah
she
looked
neither
to
right
nor
left
but
at
once
descended
the
staircase
and
took
her
way
along
the
arcade
when
she
reached
the
gate
of
the
garden
she
hesitated
before
knocking
upon
it
the
sight
of
the
villa
the
arches
the
white
walls
and
clustering
trees
she
knew
so
well
hurt
her
so
frightfully
so
unexpectedly
that
she
felt
frightened
and
sick
and
as
if
she
must
go
away
quickly
to
some
place
which
she
had
never
seen
and
which
could
call
up
no
reminiscences
in
her
mind
perhaps
she
would
have
gone
into
the
oasis
or
along
the
path
that
skirted
the
river
bed
had
not
smain
softly
opened
the
gate
and
come
out
to
meet
her
holding
a
great
velvety
rose
in
his
slim
hand
he
gave
it
to
her
without
a
word
smiling
languidly
with
eyes
in
which
the
sun
seemed
caught
and
turned
to
glittering
darkness
and
as
she
took
it
and
moved
it
in
her
fingers
looking
at
the
petals
on
which
lay
tiny
drops
of
water
gleaming
with
thin
and
silvery
lights
she
remembered
her
first
visit
to
the
garden
and
the
mysterious
enchantment
that
had
floated
out
to
her
through
the
gate
from
the
golden
vistas
and
the
dusky
shadows
of
the
trees
the
feeling
of
romantic
expectation
that
had
stirred
within
her
as
she
stepped
on
to
the
sand
and
saw
before
her
the
winding
ways
disappearing
into
dimness
between
the
rills
edged
by
the
pink
geraniums
how
long
ago
that
seemed
like
a
remembrance
of
early
childhood
in
the
heart
of
one
who
is
old
now
that
the
gate
was
open
she
resolved
to
go
into
the
garden
she
might
as
well
be
there
as
elsewhere
she
stepped
in
holding
the
rose
in
her
hand
one
of
the
drops
of
water
slipped
from
an
outer
petal
and
fell
upon
the
sand
she
thought
of
it
as
a
tear
the
rose
was
weeping
but
her
eyes
were
dry
she
touched
the
rose
with
her
lips
the
garden
was
like
a
stranger
to
her
but
a
stranger
with
whom
she
had
once
long
long
ago
been
intimate
whom
she
had
trusted
and
by
whom
she
had
been
betrayed
she
looked
at
it
and
knew
that
she
had
thought
it
beautiful
and
loved
it
from
its
recesses
had
come
to
her
troops
of
dreams
the
leaves
of
its
trees
had
touched
her
as
with
tender
hands
the
waters
of
its
rills
had
whispered
to
her
of
the
hidden
things
that
lie
in
the
breast
of
joy
the
golden
rays
that
played
through
its
scented
alleys
had
played
too
through
the
shadows
of
her
heart
making
a
warmth
and
light
there
that
seemed
to
come
from
heaven
she
knew
this
as
one
knows
of
the
apparent
humanity
that
greeted
one
s
own
humanity
in
the
friend
who
is
a
friend
no
longer
and
she
sickened
at
it
as
at
the
thought
of
remembered
intimacy
with
one
proved
treacherous
there
seemed
to
her
nothing
ridiculous
in
this
personification
of
the
garden
as
there
had
formerly
seemed
to
her
nothing
ridiculous
in
her
thought
of
the
desert
as
a
being
but
the
fact
that
she
did
thus
instinctively
personify
the
nature
that
surrounded
her
gave
to
the
garden
in
her
eyes
an
aspect
that
was
hostile
and
even
threatening
as
if
she
faced
a
love
now
changed
to
hate
a
cold
and
inimical
watchfulness
that
knew
too
much
about
her
to
which
she
had
once
told
all
her
happy
secrets
and
murmured
all
her
hopes
she
did
not
hate
the
garden
but
she
felt
as
if
she
feared
it
the
movements
of
its
leaves
conveyed
to
her
uneasiness
the
hidden
places
which
once
had
been
to
her
retreats
peopled
with
tranquil
blessings
were
now
become
ambushes
in
which
lay
lurking
enemies
yet
she
did
not
leave
it
for
something
seemed
to
tell
her
that
it
was
meant
that
she
should
suffer
and
she
bowed
in
spirit
to
the
decree
she
went
on
slowly
till
she
reached
the
she
entered
it
and
sat
down
she
had
not
seen
any
of
the
gardeners
or
heard
the
note
of
a
flute
the
day
was
very
still
she
looked
at
the
narrow
doorway
and
remembered
exactly
the
attitude
in
which
count
anteoni
had
stood
during
their
first
interview
holding
a
trailing
branch
of
the
bougainvillea
in
his
hand
she
saw
him
as
a
shadow
that
the
desert
had
taken
glancing
down
at
the
carpet
sand
she
imagined
the
figure
of
the
crouching
there
and
recalled
his
prophecy
and
directly
she
did
this
she
knew
that
she
had
believed
in
it
she
had
believed
that
one
day
she
would
ride
out
into
the
desert
in
a
storm
and
that
with
her
enclosed
in
the
curtains
of
a
palanquin
there
would
be
a
companion
the
diviner
had
not
told
her
who
would
be
this
companion
darkness
was
about
him
rendering
him
invisible
to
the
eyes
of
the
seer
but
her
heart
had
told
her
she
had
seen
the
other
figure
in
the
palanquin
it
was
a
man
it
was
androvsky
she
had
believed
that
she
would
go
out
into
the
desert
with
androvsky
with
this
traveller
of
whose
history
of
whose
soul
she
knew
nothing
some
inherent
fatalism
within
her
had
told
her
so
and
now
the
darkness
of
the
shade
beneath
the
trees
in
this
inmost
recess
of
the
garden
fell
upon
her
like
the
darkness
of
that
storm
in
which
the
desert
was
blotted
out
and
it
was
fearful
to
her
because
she
felt
that
she
must
travel
in
the
storm
alone
till
now
she
had
been
very
much
alone
in
life
and
had
realised
that
such
solitude
was
dreary
that
in
it
development
was
difficult
and
that
it
checked
the
steps
of
the
pilgrim
who
should
go
upward
to
the
heights
of
life
but
never
till
now
had
she
felt
the
fierce
tragedy
of
solitude
the
utter
terror
of
it
as
she
sat
in
the
looking
down
on
the
sand
she
said
to
herself
that
till
this
moment
she
had
never
had
any
idea
of
the
meaning
of
solitude
it
was
the
desert
within
a
human
soul
but
the
desert
without
the
sun
and
she
knew
this
because
at
last
she
loved
the
dark
and
silent
flood
of
passion
that
lay
within
her
had
been
released
from
its
boundaries
the
old
landmarks
were
swept
away
for
ever
the
face
of
the
world
was
changed
she
loved
androvsky
everything
in
her
loved
him
all
that
she
had
been
all
that
she
was
all
that
she
could
ever
be
loved
him
that
which
was
physical
in
her
that
which
was
spiritual
the
brain
the
heart
the
soul
body
and
flame
burning
within
it
all
that
made
her
the
wonder
that
is
woman
loved
him
she
was
love
for
androvsky
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
nothing
else
had
never
been
anything
else
the
past
years
were
nothing
the
pain
by
which
she
was
stricken
when
her
mother
fled
by
which
she
was
tormented
when
her
father
died
blaspheming
were
nothing
there
was
no
room
in
her
for
anything
but
love
of
androvsky
at
this
moment
even
her
love
of
god
seemed
to
have
been
expelled
from
her
afterwards
she
remembered
that
she
did
not
think
of
it
now
for
her
there
was
a
universe
with
but
one
figure
in
it
androvsky
she
was
unconscious
of
herself
except
as
love
for
him
she
was
unconscious
of
any
creative
power
to
whom
she
owed
the
fact
that
he
was
there
to
be
loved
by
her
she
was
passion
and
he
was
that
to
which
passion
flowed
the
world
was
the
stream
and
the
sea
as
she
sat
there
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
knees
her
eyes
bent
down
and
the
purple
flowers
all
about
her
she
felt
simplified
and
cleansed
as
if
a
mass
of
little
things
had
been
swept
from
her
leaving
space
for
the
great
thing
that
henceforth
must
for
ever
dwell
within
her
and
dominate
her
life
the
burning
shame
of
which
she
had
been
conscious
on
the
previous
night
when
androvsky
told
her
of
his
approaching
departure
and
she
was
stricken
as
by
a
lightning
flash
had
died
away
from
her
utterly
she
remembered
it
with
wonder
how
should
she
be
ashamed
of
love
she
thought
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
her
to
be
ashamed
even
if
androvsky
knew
all
that
she
knew
just
then
the
immense
truth
of
her
feeling
conquered
everything
else
made
every
other
thing
seem
false
and
she
said
to
herself
that
of
truth
she
did
not
know
how
to
be
ashamed
but
with
the
knowledge
of
the
immense
truth
of
her
love
came
the
knowledge
of
the
immense
sorrow
that
might
that
must
dwell
side
by
side
with
it
suddenly
she
moved
she
lifted
her
eyes
from
the
sand
and
looked
out
into
the
garden
besides
this
truth
within
her
there
was
one
other
thing
in
the
world
that
was
true
androvsky
was
going
away
while
she
sat
there
the
moments
were
passing
they
were
making
the
hours
that
were
bent
upon
destruction
she
was
sitting
in
the
garden
now
and
androvsky
was
close
by
a
little
time
would
pass
noiselessly
she
would
be
sitting
there
and
androvsky
would
be
far
away
gone
from
the
desert
gone
out
of
her
life
no
doubt
for
ever
and
the
garden
would
not
have
changed
each
tree
would
stand
in
its
place
each
flower
would
still
give
forth
its
scent
the
breeze
would
go
on
travelling
through
the
lacework
of
the
branches
the
streams
slipping
between
the
sandy
walls
of
the
rills
the
inexorable
sun
would
shine
and
the
desert
would
whisper
in
its
blue
distances
of
the
unseen
things
that
always
dwell
beyond
and
androvsky
would
be
gone
their
short
intercourse
so
full
of
pain
uneasiness
reserve
so
fragmentary
so
troubled
by
abrupt
violences
by
ignorance
by
a
sense
of
horror
even
on
the
one
side
and
by
an
almost
constant
suspicion
on
the
other
would
have
come
to
an
end
she
was
stunned
by
the
thought
and
looked
round
her
as
if
she
expected
inanimate
nature
to
take
up
arms
for
her
against
this
fate
yet
she
did
not
for
a
moment
think
of
taking
up
arms
herself
she
had
left
the
hotel
without
trying
to
see
androvsky
she
did
not
intend
to
return
to
it
till
he
was
gone
the
idea
of
seeking
him
never
came
into
her
mind
there
is
an
intensity
of
feeling
that
generates
action
but
there
is
a
greater
intensity
of
feeling
that
renders
action
impossible
the
feeling
that
seems
to
turn
a
human
being
into
a
shell
of
stone
within
which
burn
all
the
fires
of
creation
domini
knew
that
she
would
not
move
out
of
the
till
the
train
was
creeping
along
the
on
its
way
from
she
had
laid
down
the
upon
the
seat
by
her
side
and
now
she
took
it
up
the
sight
of
its
familiar
pages
made
her
think
for
the
first
time
do
i
love
god
any
more
and
immediately
afterwards
came
the
thought
have
i
ever
loved
him
the
knowledge
of
her
love
for
androvsky
for
this
body
that
she
had
seen
for
this
soul
that
she
had
seen
through
the
body
like
a
flame
through
glass
made
her
believe
just
then
that
if
she
had
ever
thought
and
certainly
she
had
thought
that
she
loved
a
being
whom
she
had
never
seen
never
even
imaginatively
projected
she
had
deceived
herself
the
act
of
faith
was
not
impossible
but
the
act
of
love
for
the
object
on
which
that
faith
was
concentrated
now
seemed
to
her
impossible
for
her
body
that
remained
passive
was
full
of
a
riot
a
fury
of
life
the
flesh
that
had
slept
was
awakened
and
knew
itself
and
she
could
no
longer
feel
that
she
could
love
that
which
her
flesh
could
not
touch
that
which
could
not
touch
her
flesh
and
she
said
to
herself
without
terror
even
without
regret
i
do
not
love
i
never
have
loved
she
looked
into
the
book
unspeakable
indeed
is
the
sweetness
of
thy
contemplation
which
thou
bestowest
on
them
that
love
the
sweetness
of
thy
contemplation
she
remembered
androvsky
s
face
looking
at
her
out
of
the
heart
of
the
sun
as
they
met
for
the
first
time
in
the
blue
country
in
that
moment
she
put
him
consciously
in
the
place
of
god
and
there
was
nothing
within
her
to
say
you
are
committing
mortal
she
looked
into
the
book
once
more
and
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
words
which
she
had
read
on
her
first
morning
in
love
watcheth
and
sleeping
slumbereth
not
when
weary
it
is
not
tired
when
straitened
it
is
not
constrained
when
frightened
it
is
not
disturbed
but
like
a
vivid
flame
and
a
burning
torch
it
mounteth
upwards
and
securely
passeth
through
all
whosoever
loveth
knoweth
the
cry
of
this
she
had
always
loved
these
words
and
thought
them
the
most
beautiful
in
the
book
but
now
they
came
to
her
with
the
newness
of
the
first
spring
morning
that
ever
dawned
upon
the
world
the
depth
of
them
was
laid
bare
to
her
and
with
that
depth
the
depth
of
her
own
heart
the
paralysis
of
anguish
passed
from
her
she
no
longer
looked
to
nature
as
one
dumbly
seeking
help
for
they
led
her
to
herself
and
made
her
look
into
herself
and
her
own
love
and
know
it
when
frightened
it
is
not
disturbed
it
securely
passeth
through
that
was
absolutely
true
true
as
her
love
she
looked
down
into
her
love
and
she
saw
there
the
face
of
god
but
thought
she
saw
the
face
of
human
love
only
and
it
was
so
beautiful
and
so
strong
that
even
the
tears
upon
it
gave
her
courage
and
she
said
to
herself
nothing
matters
nothing
can
matter
so
long
as
i
have
this
love
within
me
he
is
going
away
but
i
am
not
sad
for
i
am
going
with
him
my
love
all
that
i
am
that
is
going
with
him
will
always
be
with
just
then
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
she
had
seen
androvsky
lying
dead
before
her
on
the
sand
she
could
not
have
felt
unhappy
nothing
could
do
harm
to
a
great
love
it
was
the
one
permanent
eternally
vital
thing
clad
in
an
armour
of
fire
that
no
weapon
could
pierce
free
of
all
terror
from
outside
things
because
it
held
its
safety
within
its
own
heart
everlastingly
enough
perfectly
flawlessly
complete
for
and
in
itself
for
that
moment
fear
left
her
restlessness
left
her
anyone
looking
in
upon
her
from
the
garden
would
have
looked
in
upon
a
great
calm
happiness
presently
there
came
a
step
upon
the
sand
of
the
garden
walks
a
man
going
slowly
with
a
sort
of
passionate
reluctance
as
if
something
immensely
strong
was
trying
to
hold
him
back
but
was
conquered
with
difficulty
by
something
still
stronger
that
drove
him
on
came
out
of
the
fierce
sunshine
into
the
shadow
of
the
garden
and
began
to
search
its
silent
recesses
it
was
androvsky
he
looked
bowed
and
old
and
guilty
the
two
lines
near
his
mouth
were
deep
his
lips
were
working
his
thin
cheeks
had
fallen
in
like
the
cheeks
of
a
man
devoured
by
a
wasting
illness
and
the
strong
tinge
of
sunburn
on
them
seemed
to
be
but
an
imperfect
mark
to
a
pallor
that
fully
visible
would
have
been
more
terrible
than
that
of
a
corpse
in
his
eyes
there
was
a
fixed
expression
of
ferocious
grief
that
seemed
mingled
with
ferocious
anger
as
if
he
were
suffering
from
some
dreadful
misery
and
cursed
himself
because
he
suffered
as
a
man
may
curse
himself
for
doing
a
thing
that
he
chooses
to
do
but
need
not
do
such
an
expression
may
sometimes
be
seen
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
are
resisting
a
great
temptation
he
began
to
search
the
garden
furtively
but
minutely
sometimes
he
hesitated
sometimes
he
stood
still
then
he
turned
back
and
went
a
little
way
towards
the
wide
sweep
of
sand
that
was
bathed
in
sunlight
where
the
villa
stood
then
with
more
determination
and
walking
faster
he
again
made
his
way
through
the
shadows
that
slept
beneath
the
trees
as
he
passed
between
them
he
several
times
stretched
out
trembling
hands
broke
off
branches
and
threw
them
on
the
sand
treading
on
them
heavily
and
crushing
them
down
below
the
surface
once
he
spoke
to
himself
in
a
low
voice
that
shook
as
if
with
difficulty
dominating
sobs
that
were
rising
in
his
throat
he
said
his
voice
died
away
he
took
hold
of
one
hand
with
the
other
and
went
on
silently
presently
he
made
his
way
at
last
towards
the
in
which
domini
was
still
sitting
with
one
hand
resting
on
the
open
page
whose
words
had
lit
up
the
darkness
in
her
spirit
he
came
to
it
so
softly
that
she
did
not
hear
his
step
he
saw
her
stood
quite
still
under
the
trees
and
looked
at
her
for
a
long
time
as
he
did
so
his
face
changed
till
he
seemed
to
become
another
man
the
ferocity
of
grief
and
anger
faded
from
his
eyes
which
were
filled
with
an
expression
of
profound
wonder
then
of
flickering
uncertainty
then
of
hard
manly
resolution
a
fighting
expression
that
was
full
of
sex
and
passion
the
guilty
furtive
look
which
had
been
stamped
upon
all
his
features
specially
upon
his
lips
vanished
suddenly
he
became
younger
in
appearance
his
figure
straightened
itself
his
hands
ceased
from
trembling
he
moved
away
from
the
trees
and
went
to
the
doorway
of
the
domini
looked
up
saw
him
and
got
up
quietly
clasping
her
fingers
round
the
little
book
androvsky
stood
just
beyond
the
doorway
took
off
his
hat
kept
it
in
his
hand
and
said
i
came
here
to
say
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
come
into
the
but
she
stopped
it
by
coming
at
once
to
the
opening
she
felt
that
she
could
not
speak
to
him
enclosed
within
walls
under
a
roof
he
drew
back
and
she
came
out
and
stood
beside
him
on
the
sand
did
you
know
i
should
come
he
said
she
noticed
that
he
had
ceased
to
call
her
madame
and
also
that
there
was
in
his
voice
a
sound
she
had
not
heard
in
it
before
a
note
of
new
that
suggested
a
spirit
concentrating
itself
and
aware
of
its
own
strength
to
act
no
she
answered
were
you
coming
back
to
the
hotel
this
morning
he
asked
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
slowly
then
then
you
did
not
wish
you
did
not
mean
to
see
me
again
before
i
went
it
was
not
that
i
came
to
the
garden
i
had
to
come
i
had
to
be
you
want
to
be
alone
he
said
you
want
to
be
alone
already
the
strength
was
dying
out
of
his
voice
and
face
and
the
old
uneasiness
was
waking
up
in
him
a
dreadful
expression
of
pain
came
into
his
eyes
was
that
why
you
you
looked
so
happy
he
said
in
a
harsh
trembling
voice
when
i
stood
for
a
long
while
looking
at
you
when
you
were
in
there
he
pointed
to
the
and
your
face
was
happy
your
face
was
yes
i
you
will
be
happy
alone
alone
in
the
desert
when
he
said
that
she
felt
suddenly
the
agony
of
the
waterless
spaces
the
agony
of
the
unpeopled
wastes
her
whole
spirit
shrank
and
quivered
all
the
great
joy
of
her
love
died
within
her
a
moment
before
she
had
stood
upon
the
heights
of
her
heart
now
she
shrank
into
its
deepest
blackest
abysses
she
looked
at
him
and
said
nothing
you
will
not
be
happy
his
voice
no
longer
trembled
he
caught
hold
of
her
left
hand
awkwardly
nervously
but
held
it
strongly
with
his
close
to
his
side
and
went
on
speaking
nobody
is
happy
alone
nothing
is
men
and
women
children
a
bird
flew
across
the
shadowy
space
under
the
trees
followed
by
another
bird
he
pointed
to
them
they
disappeared
the
birds
too
they
must
have
companionship
everything
wants
a
but
then
you
will
stay
here
alone
in
the
desert
what
else
can
i
do
she
said
and
that
journey
he
went
on
still
holding
her
hand
fast
against
his
side
your
journey
into
the
desert
you
will
take
it
alone
what
else
can
i
do
she
repeated
in
a
lower
voice
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
deliberately
pressing
her
down
into
the
uttermost
darkness
you
will
not
yes
i
shall
she
spoke
with
conviction
even
in
that
moment
most
of
all
in
that
moment
she
knew
that
she
would
obey
the
summons
of
the
desert
i
i
shall
never
know
the
desert
he
said
i
thought
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
too
should
go
out
into
it
i
have
wanted
to
go
you
have
made
me
want
to
i
yes
once
you
said
to
me
that
peace
must
dwell
out
there
it
was
on
the
tower
the
the
first
time
you
ever
spoke
to
i
i
wondered
i
often
wonder
why
you
spoke
to
she
knew
he
was
looking
at
her
with
intensity
but
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
sand
there
was
something
in
them
that
she
felt
he
must
not
see
a
light
that
had
just
come
into
them
as
she
realised
that
already
on
the
tower
before
she
even
knew
him
she
had
loved
him
it
was
that
love
already
born
in
her
heart
but
as
yet
unconscious
of
its
own
existence
which
had
so
strangely
increased
for
her
the
magic
of
the
african
evening
when
she
watched
it
with
him
but
before
suddenly
she
knew
that
she
had
loved
androvsky
from
the
beginning
from
the
moment
when
his
face
looked
at
her
as
if
out
of
the
heart
of
the
sun
that
was
why
her
entry
into
the
desert
had
been
full
of
such
extraordinary
significance
this
man
and
the
desert
were
had
always
been
as
one
in
her
mind
never
had
she
thought
of
the
one
without
the
other
never
had
she
been
mysteriously
called
by
the
desert
without
hearing
as
a
echo
the
voice
of
androvsky
or
been
drawn
onward
by
the
mystical
summons
of
the
blue
distances
without
being
drawn
onward
too
by
the
mystical
summons
of
the
heart
to
which
her
own
responded
the
link
between
the
man
and
the
desert
was
indissoluble
she
could
not
conceive
of
its
being
severed
and
as
she
realised
this
she
realised
also
something
that
turned
her
whole
nature
into
flame
she
could
not
conceive
of
androvsky
s
not
loving
her
of
his
not
having
loved
her
from
the
moment
when
he
saw
her
in
the
sun
to
him
too
the
desert
had
made
a
revelation
the
revelation
of
her
face
and
of
the
soul
behind
it
looking
through
it
in
the
flames
of
the
sun
as
they
went
into
the
desert
the
flames
of
their
two
spirits
had
been
blended
she
knew
that
certainly
and
for
ever
then
how
could
it
be
possible
that
androvsky
should
not
go
out
with
her
into
the
desert
why
did
you
speak
to
me
he
said
we
came
into
the
desert
together
she
answered
simply
we
had
to
know
each
and
now
now
we
have
to
say
his
voice
ceased
far
away
there
was
the
thin
sound
of
a
chime
domini
had
never
before
heard
the
church
bell
in
the
garden
and
now
she
felt
as
if
she
heard
it
not
with
her
ears
but
with
her
spirit
as
she
heard
she
felt
androvsky
s
hand
which
had
been
hot
upon
hers
turn
cold
he
let
her
hand
go
and
again
she
was
stricken
by
the
horrible
sound
she
had
heard
the
previous
night
in
the
desert
when
he
turned
his
horse
and
rode
away
with
her
and
now
as
then
he
turned
away
from
her
in
silence
but
she
knew
that
this
time
he
was
leaving
her
that
this
movement
was
his
final
with
his
head
bowed
down
he
took
a
few
steps
he
was
near
to
a
turning
of
the
path
she
watched
him
knowing
that
within
less
than
a
moment
she
would
be
watching
only
the
trees
and
the
sand
she
gazed
at
the
bent
figure
calling
up
all
her
faculties
crying
out
to
herself
passionately
desperately
remember
it
remember
it
as
it
is
there
before
you
just
as
it
is
for
as
it
reached
the
turning
in
the
distance
of
the
garden
rose
the
twitter
of
the
flute
of
larbi
androvsky
stopped
stood
still
with
his
back
turned
towards
her
and
larbi
hidden
and
far
off
showered
out
his
little
notes
of
african
love
of
love
in
the
desert
where
the
sun
is
everlasting
and
the
passion
of
man
is
hot
as
the
sun
where
liberty
reigns
lifting
her
cymbals
that
are
as
spheres
of
fire
and
the
footsteps
of
freedom
are
heard
upon
the
sand
treading
towards
the
south
larbi
played
played
on
and
on
untiring
as
the
love
that
blossomed
with
the
world
but
that
will
not
die
when
the
world
dies
then
androvsky
came
back
quickly
till
he
reached
the
place
where
domini
was
standing
he
put
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
then
he
sank
down
on
the
sand
letting
his
hands
slip
down
over
her
breast
and
along
her
whole
body
till
they
clasped
themselves
round
her
knees
he
pressed
his
face
into
her
dress
against
her
knees
i
love
you
he
said
i
love
you
but
don
t
listen
to
me
you
mustn
t
hear
it
you
mustn
t
but
i
must
say
it
i
can
t
i
can
t
go

she
heard
him
sobbing
against
her
knees
and
the
sound
was
as
the
sound
of
strength
made
audible
she
put
her
hands
against
his
temples
i
am
listening
she
said
i
must
hear
he
looked
up
rose
to
his
feet
put
his
hands
behind
her
shoulders
held
her
and
set
his
lips
on
hers
pressing
his
whole
body
against
hers

it
he
said
muttering
against
her
lips
hear
it
i
love
you
i
love
the
two
birds
they
had
seen
flew
back
beneath
the
trees
turned
in
an
airy
circle
rose
above
the
trees
into
the
blue
sky
and
side
by
side
winged
their
way
out
of
the
garden
to
the
desert
book
iv
the
journey
chapter
xvi
in
the
evening
before
the
day
of
domini
s
marriage
with
androvsky
there
was
a
strange
sunset
which
attracted
even
the
attention
and
roused
the
comment
of
the
arabs
the
day
had
been
calm
and
beautiful
one
of
the
most
lovely
days
of
the
north
african
spring
and
batouch
resting
from
the
triumphant
labour
of
superintending
the
final
preparations
for
a
long
desert
journey
augured
a
morning
of
paradise
for
the
departure
along
the
straight
road
that
led
at
last
to
tombouctou
but
as
the
radiant
afternoon
drew
to
its
end
there
came
into
the
blue
sky
a
whiteness
that
suggested
a
heaven
turning
pale
in
the
contemplation
of
some
act
that
was
piteous
and
terrible
and
under
this
blanching
heaven
the
desert
and
all
things
and
people
of
the
oasis
of
assumed
an
aspect
of
apprehension
as
if
they
felt
themselves
to
be
in
the
thrall
of
some
power
whose
omnipotence
they
could
not
question
and
whose
purpose
they
feared
this
whiteness
was
shot
at
the
hour
of
sunset
with
streaks
of
sulphur
yellow
and
dappled
with
small
ribbed
clouds
tinged
with
a
bitter
and
cruel
shade
of
green
that
distressed
the
eyes
as
a
merciless
light
distresses
them
but
these
colours
quickly
faded
and
again
the
whiteness
prevailed
for
a
brief
space
of
time
before
the
heavy
falling
of
a
darkness
unpierced
by
stars
with
this
darkness
came
a
faint
moaning
of
hollow
wind
from
the
desert
a
lamentable
murmur
that
shuddered
over
the
great
spaces
crept
among
the
palms
and
the
houses
and
died
away
at
the
foot
of
the
brown
mountains
beyond
the
hammam
salahine
the
succeeding
silence
short
and
intense
was
like
a
sound
of
fear
like
the
cry
of
a
voice
lifted
up
in
protest
against
the
approach
of
an
unknown
but
dreaded
fate
then
the
wind
came
again
with
a
stronger
moaning
and
a
lengthened
life
not
yet
forceful
not
yet
with
all
its
powers
but
more
tenacious
more
acquainted
with
itself
and
the
deeds
that
it
might
do
when
the
night
was
black
among
the
vast
sands
which
were
its
among
the
crouching
plains
and
the
trembling
palm
groves
that
would
be
its
batouch
looked
grave
as
he
listened
to
the
wind
and
the
creaking
of
the
palm
stems
one
against
another
sand
came
upon
his
face
he
pulled
the
hood
of
his
burnous
over
his
turban
and
across
his
cheeks
covered
his
mouth
with
a
fold
of
his
haik
and
stared
into
the
blackness
like
an
animal
in
search
of
something
his
instinct
has
detected
approaching
from
a
distance
ali
was
beside
him
in
the
doorway
of
the
cafe
maure
a
slim
arab
boy
and
serious
as
an
idol
who
was
a
troubadour
of
the
sahara
singer
of
janat
and
many
lovesongs
player
of
the
guitar
backed
with
sand
tortoise
and
faced
with
stretched
goatskin
behind
them
swung
an
oil
lamp
fastened
to
a
beam
of
palm
and
the
red
ashes
glowed
in
the
coffee
niche
and
shed
a
ray
upon
the
shelf
of
small
white
cups
with
faint
designs
of
gold
in
a
corner
his
black
face
and
arms
faintly
relieved
against
the
wall
an
old
negro
crouched
gazing
into
vacancy
with
bulging
eyes
and
beating
with
a
curved
palm
stem
upon
an
oval
drum
whose
murmur
was
deep
and
hollow
as
the
murmur
of
the
wind
and
seemed
indeed
its
echo
prisoned
within
the
room
and
striving
to
escape
there
is
sand
on
my
eyelids
said
batouch
it
is
bad
for
when
allah
sends
the
sands
we
should
cover
the
face
and
play
the
ladies
game
within
the
cafe
we
should
not
travel
on
the
road
towards
the
ali
said
nothing
but
drew
up
his
haik
over
his
mouth
and
nose
and
looked
into
the
night
folding
his
thin
hands
in
his
burnous
achmed
will
sleep
in
the
bordj
of
arba
continued
batouch
in
a
low
murmuring
voice
as
if
speaking
to
himself
and
the
beasts
will
be
in
the
court
nothing
can
remain
outside
for
there
will
be
a
greater
roaring
of
the
wind
at
arba
can
it
be
the
will
of
allah
that
we
rest
in
the
tents
ali
made
no
answer
the
wind
had
suddenly
died
down
the
sand
grains
came
no
more
against
their
eyelids
and
the
folds
of
their
haiks
behind
them
the
negro
s
drum
gave
out
monotonously
its
echo
of
the
wind
filling
the
silence
of
the
night
whatever
allah
sends
batouch
went
on
softly
after
a
pause
madame
will
go
she
is
brave
as
the
lion
there
is
no
jackal
in
madame
irena
is
not
more
brave
than
she
is
but
madame
will
never
wear
the
veil
for
a
man
s
sake
she
will
not
wear
the
veil
but
she
could
give
a
if
he
were
to
look
at
another
woman
as
he
has
looked
at
her
as
he
will
look
at
her
she
is
proud
as
a
touareg
and
there
is
fierceness
in
her
but
he
will
never
look
at
another
woman
as
he
will
look
at
her
the
roumi
is
not
as
we
the
wind
came
back
to
join
its
sound
with
the
drum
imprisoning
the
two
arabs
in
a
muttering
circle
they
will
not
care
said
batouch
they
will
go
out
into
the
storm
without
the
sand
pattered
more
sharply
on
his
eyelids
he
drew
back
into
the
cafe
ali
followed
him
and
they
squatted
down
side
by
side
upon
the
ground
and
looked
before
them
seriously
the
noise
of
the
wind
increased
till
it
nearly
drowned
the
noise
of
the
negro
s
drum
presently
the
owner
of
the
cafe
brought
them
two
cups
of
coffee
setting
the
cups
near
their
stockinged
feet
they
rolled
two
cigarettes
and
smoked
in
silence
sipping
the
coffee
from
time
to
time
then
ali
began
to
glance
towards
the
negro
half
shutting
his
eyes
and
assuming
a
languid
expression
that
was
almost
sickly
he
stretched
his
lips
in
a
smile
gently
moving
his
head
from
side
to
side
batouch
watched
him
presently
he
opened
his
lips
and
began
to
sing
the
love
of
women
is
like
a
date
that
is
golden
in
the
sun
that
is
golden
the
love
of
women
is
like
a
gazelle
that
comes
to
drink
to
drink
at
the
water
springs
the
love
of
women
is
like
the
nargileh
and
like
the
dust
of
the
keef
that
is
mingled
with
tobacco
and
with
honey
put
the
reed
between
thy
lips
o
loving
man
and
draw
dreams
from
the
haschish
that
is
the
love
of
women
janat
janat
janat
the
wind
grew
louder
and
sand
was
blown
along
the
cafe
floor
and
about
the
the
love
of
women
is
like
the
rose
of
the
caid
s
garden
that
is
full
of
silver
tears
the
love
of
women
is
like
the
first
day
of
the
spring
when
the
children
play
at
cora
the
love
of
women
is
like
the
derbouka
that
has
been
warmed
at
the
fire
and
gives
out
a
sweet
sound
take
it
in
thy
hands
o
loving
man
and
sing
to
the
derbouka
that
is
the
love
of
women
janat
janat
janat
in
the
doorway
where
the
lamp
swung
from
the
beam
a
man
in
european
dress
stood
still
to
listen
the
wind
wailed
behind
him
and
stirred
his
clothes
his
eyes
shone
in
the
faint
light
with
a
fierceness
of
emotion
in
which
there
was
a
joy
that
was
almost
terrible
but
in
which
there
seemed
also
to
be
something
that
was
troubled
when
the
song
died
away
and
only
the
voices
of
the
wind
and
the
drum
spoke
to
the
darkness
he
disappeared
into
the
night
the
arabs
did
not
see
him
janat
janat
janat
the
night
drew
on
and
the
storm
increased
all
the
doors
of
the
houses
were
closely
shut
upon
the
roofs
the
guard
dogs
crouched
shivering
and
whining
against
the
earthen
parapets
the
camels
groaned
in
the
fondouks
and
the
tufted
heads
of
the
palms
swayed
like
the
waves
of
the
sea
and
the
sahara
seemed
to
be
lifting
up
its
voice
in
a
summons
that
was
tremendous
as
a
summons
to
judgment
domini
had
always
known
that
the
desert
would
summon
her
she
heard
its
summons
now
in
the
night
without
fear
the
roaring
of
the
tempest
was
sweet
in
her
ears
as
the
sound
of
the
derbouka
to
the
loving
man
of
the
sands
it
accorded
with
the
fire
that
lit
up
the
cloud
of
passion
in
her
heart
its
wildness
marched
in
step
with
a
marching
wildness
in
her
veins
and
pulses
for
her
gipsy
blood
was
astir
and
the
recklessness
of
the
boy
in
her
seemed
to
clamour
with
the
storm
the
sound
of
the
wind
was
as
the
sound
of
the
clashing
cymbals
of
liberty
calling
her
to
the
adventure
that
love
would
glorify
to
the
life
that
love
would
make
perfect
to
the
untrodden
paths
of
the
sun
of
which
she
had
dreamed
in
the
shadows
and
on
which
she
would
set
her
feet
at
last
with
the
comrade
of
her
soul
her
life
would
begin
her
real
life
the
life
of
which
men
and
women
dream
as
the
prisoner
dreams
of
freedom
and
she
was
glad
she
thanked
god
that
her
past
years
had
been
empty
of
joy
that
in
her
youth
she
had
been
robbed
of
youth
s
pleasures
she
thanked
god
that
she
had
come
to
maturity
without
knowing
love
it
seemed
to
her
that
to
love
in
early
life
was
almost
pitiful
was
a
catastrophe
an
experience
for
which
the
soul
was
not
ready
and
so
could
not
appreciate
at
its
full
and
wonderful
value
she
thought
of
it
as
of
a
child
being
taken
away
from
the
world
to
paradise
without
having
known
the
pain
of
existence
in
the
world
and
at
that
moment
she
worshipped
suffering
every
tear
that
she
had
ever
shed
she
loved
every
weary
hour
every
despondent
thought
every
cruel
disappointment
she
called
around
her
the
congregation
of
her
past
sorrows
and
she
blessed
them
and
bade
them
depart
from
her
for
ever
as
she
heard
the
roaring
of
the
wind
she
smiled
the
sahara
was
fulfilling
the
words
of
the
diviner
she
and
androvsky
would
go
out
into
the
storm
and
the
darkness
together
the
train
of
camels
would
be
lost
in
the
desolation
of
the
desert
and
the
people
of
would
see
it
vanish
and
perhaps
would
pity
those
who
were
hidden
by
the
curtains
of
the
palanquin
they
would
pity
her
as
suzanne
pitied
her
openly
with
eyes
that
were
tragic
she
laughed
aloud
it
was
late
in
the
night
midnight
had
sounded
yet
she
did
not
go
to
bed
she
feared
to
sleep
to
lose
the
consciousness
of
her
joy
of
the
glory
which
had
come
into
her
life
she
was
a
miser
of
the
golden
hours
of
this
black
and
howling
night
to
sleep
would
be
to
be
robbed
a
splendid
avarice
in
her
rebelled
against
the
thought
of
sleep
was
androvsky
sleeping
she
wondered
and
longed
to
know
she
was
fully
aware
for
the
first
time
of
the
inherent
fearlessness
of
her
character
which
was
made
perfect
at
last
by
her
perfect
love
alone
she
had
always
had
courage
even
in
her
most
listless
hours
she
had
never
been
a
craven
but
now
she
felt
the
completeness
of
a
nature
clothed
in
armour
that
rendered
it
impregnable
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
man
should
have
the
power
to
put
the
finishing
touch
to
god
s
work
that
religion
should
stoop
to
be
a
handmaid
to
faith
in
a
human
being
but
she
did
not
think
it
strange
everything
in
life
seemed
to
her
to
be
in
perfect
accord
because
her
heart
was
in
perfect
accord
with
another
heart
and
she
welcomed
the
storm
she
even
welcomed
something
else
that
came
to
her
now
in
the
storm
the
memory
of
the
s
tortured
face
as
he
gazed
down
reading
her
fate
in
the
sand
for
what
was
an
untroubled
fate
surely
a
life
that
crept
along
the
hollows
and
had
no
impulse
to
call
it
to
the
heights
knowing
the
flawless
perfection
of
her
armour
she
had
a
wild
longing
to
prove
it
she
wished
that
there
should
be
assaults
upon
her
love
because
she
knew
she
could
resist
them
one
and
all
and
she
wished
to
have
the
keen
joy
of
resisting
them
there
is
a
health
of
body
so
keen
and
vital
that
it
desires
combat
the
soul
sometimes
knows
a
precisely
similar
health
and
is
filled
with
a
similar
desire
put
my
love
to
the
proof
o
god
was
domini
s
last
prayer
that
night
when
the
storm
was
at
its
wildest
put
my
love
to
the
uttermost
proof
that
he
may
know
it
as
he
can
never
know
it
and
she
fell
asleep
at
length
peacefully
in
the
tumult
of
the
night
feeling
that
god
had
heard
her
prayer
the
dawn
came
struggling
like
an
exhausted
pilgrim
through
the
windy
dark
pale
and
faint
with
no
courage
it
seemed
to
grow
bravely
into
day
as
if
with
the
sedulous
effort
of
something
weary
but
of
unconquered
will
it
slowly
lit
up
with
a
feeble
light
that
flickered
in
a
cloud
of
whirling
sand
revealing
the
desolation
of
an
almost
featureless
void
the
village
the
whole
oasis
was
penetrated
by
a
passionate
fog
that
instead
of
brooding
heavily
phlegmatically
over
the
face
of
life
and
nature
travelled
like
a
demented
thing
bent
upon
instant
destruction
and
coming
thus
cloudily
to
be
more
free
for
crime
it
was
an
emissary
of
the
desert
propelled
with
irresistible
force
from
the
farthest
recess
of
the
dunes
and
the
desert
itself
seemed
to
be
hurrying
behind
it
as
if
to
spy
upon
the
doing
of
its
deeds
as
the
sea
in
a
great
storm
rages
against
the
land
ferocious
that
land
should
be
so
the
desert
now
raged
against
the
oasis
that
ventured
to
exist
in
its
bosom
every
palm
tree
was
the
victim
of
its
wrath
every
running
rill
every
habitation
of
man
along
the
tunnels
of
mimosa
it
went
like
a
foaming
tide
through
a
cavern
roaring
towards
the
mountains
it
returned
and
swept
about
the
narrow
streets
eddying
at
the
corners
beating
upon
the
palmwood
doors
behind
which
the
painted
were
cowering
cold
under
their
pigments
and
their
heavy
jewels
their
red
hands
trembling
and
clasping
one
another
clamouring
about
the
minarets
of
the
mosques
on
which
the
frightened
doves
were
sheltering
shaking
the
fences
that
shut
in
the
gazelles
in
their
pleasaunce
tearing
at
the
great
statue
of
the
cardinal
that
faced
it
resolutely
holding
up
the
double
cross
as
if
to
exorcise
it
battering
upon
the
tall
white
tower
on
whose
summit
domini
had
first
spoken
with
androvsky
raging
through
the
alleys
of
count
anteoni
s
garden
the
arcades
of
his
villa
the
of
the
from
whose
walls
it
tore
down
frantically
the
purple
petals
of
the
bougainvillea
and
dashed
them
like
enemies
defeated
upon
the
quivering
paths
which
were
made
of
its
own
body
everywhere
in
the
oasis
it
came
with
a
lust
to
kill
but
surely
its
deepest
enmity
was
concentrated
upon
the
catholic
church
there
despite
the
tempest
people
were
huddled
drawn
together
not
so
much
by
the
ceremony
that
was
to
take

the
desire
to
see
the
departure
of
an
unusual
caravan

desert
centre
news
is
propagated
with
a
rapidity
seldom
equalled
in
the
home
of
civilisation
it
runs
from
mouth
to
mouth

fire
along
straw

in
his
glory
had
not
been
slow
to
speak
of
the
wonders
prepared
under
his
superintendence
to
make
complete
the
desert
journey
of
his
mistress
and
androvsky
the
main
part
of
the
camp
had
already
gone
forward
and
must
have
reached
arba
the
first
halting
stage
outside
tents
the
horses
for
the
roumis
the
mules
to
carry
necessary
baggage
the
cooking
utensils
and
the
guard
dogs
but
the
roumis
themselves
were
to
depart
from
the
church
on
directly
the
marriage
was
accomplished
domini
who
had
a
native
hatred
of
everything
that
savoured
of
ostentation
had
wished
for
a
tiny
expedition
and
would
gladly
have
gone
out
into
the
desert
with
but
one
tent
batouch
and
a
servant
to
do
the
cooking
but
the
journey
was
to
be
long
and
indefinite
an
aimless
wandering
through
the
land
of
liberty
towards
the
south
without
fixed
purpose
or
time
of
returning
she
knew
nothing
of
what
was
necessary
for
such
a
journey
and
tired
of
ceaseless
argument
and
too
much
occupied
with
joy
to
burden
herself
with
detail
at
last
let
batouch
have
his
way
i
leave
it
to
you
batouch
she
said
but
remember
as
few
people
and
beasts
as
possible
and
as
you
say
we
must
have
camels
for
certain
parts
of
the
journey
we
will
travel
the
first
stage
on
consciously
she
helped
to
fulfil
the
prediction
of
the
diviner
and
then
she
left
batouch
free
now
outside
the
church
shrouded
closely
in
hoods
and
haiks
grey
and
brown
bundles
with
staring
eyes
the
desert
men
were
huddled
against
the
church
wall
in
the
wind
hadj
was
there
and
smain
sheltering
in
his
burnous
roses
from
count
anteoni
s
garden
larbi
had
come
with
his
flute
and
the
from
his
black
bazaar
for
domini
had
bought
perfumes
from
him
on
her
last
day
in
most
of
count
anteoni
s
gardeners
had
assembled
they
looked
upon
the
roumi
lady
who
rode
magnificently
but
who
could
dream
as
they
dreamed
too
as
a
friend
had
she
not
haunted
the
alleys
where
they
worked
and
idled
till
they
had
learned
to
expect
her
and
to
miss
her
when
she
did
not
come
and
with
those
whom
domini
knew
were
assembled
their
friends
and
their
friends
friends
men
of
men
from
the
near
oasis
and
also
many
of
those
desert
wanderers
who
drift
in
daily
out
of
the
sands
to
the
centres
of
buying
and
selling
barter
their
goods
for
the
goods
of
the
south
or
sell
their
loads
of
dates
for
money
and
having
enjoyed
the
dissipation
of
the
cafes
and
of
the
drift
away
again
into
the
pathless
wastes
which
are
their
home
few
of
the
french
population
had
ventured
out
and
the
church
itself
was
almost
deserted
when
the
hour
for
the
wedding
drew
nigh
the
priest
came
from
his
little
house
bending
forward
against
the
wind
his
eyes
partially
protected
from
the
driving
sand
by
blue
spectacles
his
face
which
was
habitually
grave
looked
sad
and
stern
like
the
face
of
a
man
about
to
perform
a
task
that
was
against
his
inclination
even
perhaps
against
his
conscience
he
glanced
at
the
waiting
arabs
and
hastened
into
the
church
taking
off
his
spectacles
as
he
did
so
and
wiping
his
eyes
which
were
red
from
the
action
of
the
with
a
silk
when
he
reached
the
sacristy
he
shut
himself
into
it
alone
for
a
moment
he
sat
down
on
a
chair
and
leaning
his
arms
upon
the
wooden
table
that
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
bent
forward
and
stared
before
him
at
the
wall
opposite
listening
to
the
howling
of
the
wind
father
roubier
had
an
almost
passionate
affection
for
his
little
church
of
so
long
and
ardently
had
he
prayed
and
taught
in
it
so
often
had
he
passed
the
twilight
hours
in
it
alone
wrapped
in
religious
reveries
or
searching
his
conscience
for
the
shadows
of
sinful
thoughts
that
it
had
become
to
him
as
a
friend
and
more
than
a
friend
he
thought
of
it
sometimes
as
his
confessor
and
sometimes
as
his
child
its
stones
were
to
him
as
flesh
and
blood
its
altars
as
lips
that
whispered
consolation
in
answer
to
his
prayers
the
figures
of
its
saints
were
heavenly
companions
in
its
ugliness
he
perceived
only
beauty
in
its
tawdriness
only
the
graces
that
are
sweet
offerings
to
god
the
love
that
had
he
not
been
a
priest
he
might
have
given
to
a
woman
he
poured
forth
upon
his
church
and
with
it
that
other
love
which
had
it
been
the
design
of
his
heavenly
father
would
have
fitted
him
for
the
ascetic
yet
impassioned
life
of
an
ardent
and
devoted
monk
to
defend
this
consecrated
building
against
outrage
he
would
without
hesitation
have
given
his
last
drop
of
blood
and
now
he
was
to
perform
in
it
an
act
against
which
his
whole
nature
revolted
he
was
to
join
indissolubly
the
lives
of
these
two
strangers
who
had
come
to
domini
enfilden
and
boris
androvsky
he
was
to
put
on
the
surplice
and
white
stole
to
say
the
solemn
and
irreparable
ego
jungo
to
sprinkle
the
ring
with
holy
water
and
bless
it
as
he
sat
there
alone
listening
to
the
howling
of
the
storm
outside
he
went
mentally
through
the
coming
ceremony
he
thought
of
the
wonderful
grace
and
beauty
of
the
prayers
of
benediction
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
to
pronounce
them
with
his
lips
while
his
nature
revolted
against
his
own
utterance
was
to
perform
a
shameful
act
was
to
offer
an
insult
to
this
little
church
he
loved
yet
how
could
he
help
performing
this
act
he
knew
that
he
would
do
it
within
a
few
minutes
he
would
be
standing
before
the
altar
he
would
be
looking
into
the
faces
of
this
man
and
woman
whose
love
he
was
called
upon
to
consecrate
he
would
consecrate
it
and
they
would
go
out
from
him
into
the
desert
man
and
wife
they
would
be
lost
to
his
sight
in
the
town
his
eye
fell
upon
a
silver
crucifix
that
was
hanging
upon
the
wall
in
front
of
him
he
was
not
a
very
imaginative
man
not
a
man
given
to
fancies
a
dreamer
of
dreams
more
real
to
him
than
life
or
a
seer
of
visions
but
he
was
stirred
and
perhaps
the
unwonted
turmoil
of
his
mind
acted
subtly
upon
his
nervous
system
afterward
he
felt
certain
that
it
must
have
been
so
for
in
no
other
way
could
he
account
for
a
fantasy
that
beset
him
at
this
moment
as
he
looked
at
the
crucifix
there
came
against
the
church
a
more
furious
beating
of
the
wind
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
christ
upon
the
crucifix
shuddered
he
saw
it
shudder
he
started
leaned
across
the
table
and
stared
at
the
crucifix
with
eyes
that
were
full
of
an
amazement
that
was
mingled
with
horror
then
he
got
up
crossed
the
room
and
touched
the
crucifix
with
his
finger
as
he
did
so
the
acolyte
whose
duty
it
was
to
help
him
to
robe
knocked
at
the
sacristy
door
the
sharp
noise
recalled
him
to
himself
he
knew
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
been
the
slave
of
an
optical
delusion
he
knew
it
and
yet
he
could
not
banish
the
feeling
that
god
himself
was
averse
from
the
act
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
committing
in
this
church
that
confronted
islam
that
god
himself
shuddered
as
surely
even
he
the
creator
must
shudder
at
some
of
the
actions
of
his
creatures
and
this
feeling
added
immensely
to
the
distress
of
the
priest
s
mind
in
performing
this
ceremony
he
now
had
the
dreadful
sensation
that
he
was
putting
himself
into
direct
antagonism
with
god
his
instinctive
horror
of
androvsky
had
never
been
so
great
as
it
was
in
vain
he
had
striven
to
conquer
it
to
draw
near
to
this
man
who
roused
all
the
repulsion
of
his
nature
his
efforts
had
been
useless
he
had
prayed
to
be
given
the
sympathy
for
this
man
that
the
true
christian
ought
to
feel
towards
every
human
being
even
the
most
degraded
but
he
felt
that
his
prayers
had
not
been
answered
with
every
day
his
antipathy
for
androvsky
increased
yet
he
was
entirely
unable
to
ground
it
upon
any
definite
fact
in
androvsky
s
character
he
did
not
know
that
character
the
man
was
as
much
a
mystery
to
him
as
on
the
day
when
they
first
met
and
to
this
living
mystery
from
which
his
soul
recoiled
he
was
about
to
consign
with
all
the
beautiful
and
solemn
blessings
of
his
church
a
woman
whose
character
he
respected
whose
innate
purity
strength
and
nobility
he
had
quickly
divined
and
no
less
quickly
learned
to
love
it
was
a
bitter
even
a
horrible
moment
to
him
the
little
acolyte
a
french
boy
son
of
the
postmaster
of
was
startled
by
the
sight
of
the
father
s
face
when
he
opened
the
sacristy
door
he
had
never
before
seen
such
an
expression
of
almost
harsh
pain
in
those
usually
kind
eyes
and
he
drew
back
from
the
threshold
like
one
afraid
his
movement
recalled
the
priest
to
a
sharp
consciousness
of
the
necessities
of
the
moment
and
with
a
strong
effort
he
conquered
his
pain
sufficiently
to
conceal
all
outward
expression
of
it
he
smiled
gently
at
the
little
boy
and
said
is
it
time
the
child
looked
reassured
yes
he
came
into
the
sacristy
and
went
towards
the
cupboard
where
the
vestments
were
kept
passing
the
silver
crucifix
as
he
did
so
he
glanced
at
it
he
opened
the
cupboard
then
stood
for
a
moment
and
again
turned
his
eyes
to
the
christ
the
father
watched
him
what
are
you
looking
at
paul
he
asked
nothing
father
the
boy
replied
with
a
sudden
expression
of
reluctance
that
was
almost
obstinate
and
he
began
to
take
the
priest
s
robes
out
of
the
cupboard
just
then
the
wind
wailed
again
furiously
about
the
church
and
the
crucifix
fell
down
upon
the
floor
of
the
sacristy
the
priest
started
forward
picked
it
up
and
stood
with
it
in
his
hand
he
glanced
at
the
wall
and
saw
at
once
that
the
nail
to
which
the
crucifix
had
been
fastened
had
come
out
of
its
hole
a
flake
of
plaster
had
been
detached
perhaps
some
days
ago
and
the
hole
had
become
too
large
to
retain
the
nail
the
explanation
of
the
matter
was
perfect
simple
and
comprehensible
yet
the
priest
felt
as
if
a
catastrophe
had
just
taken
place
as
he
stared
at
the
cross
he
heard
a
little
noise
near
him
the
acolyte
was
crying
why
paul
what
s
the
matter
he
said
why
did
it
do
that
exclaimed
the
boy
as
if
alarmed
why
did
it
do
that
perhaps
it
was
the
wind
everything
is
shaking
come
come
my
child
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
he
laid
the
crucifix
on
the
table
paul
dried
his
eyes
with
his
fists
i
don
t
like
he
said
i
don
t
like
the
priest
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
the
weather
has
upset
you
he
said
smiling
but
the
nervous
behaviour
of
the
child
deepened
strangely
his
own
sense
of
apprehension
when
he
had
robed
he
waited
for
the
arrival
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
there
was
to
be
no
mass
and
no
music
except
the
wedding
march
which
the
harmonium
player
a
marseillais
employed
in
the
trade
insisted
on
performing
to
do
honour
to
mademoiselle
enfilden
who
had
taken
such
an
interest
in
the
music
of
the
church
androvsky
as
the
priest
had
ascertained
had
been
brought
up
in
the
catholic
religion
but
when
questioned
he
had
said
quietly
that
he
was
no
longer
a
practising
catholic
and
that
he
never
went
to
confession
under
these
circumstances
it
was
not
possible
to
have
a
nuptial
mass
the
service
would
be
short
and
plain
and
the
priest
was
glad
that
this
was
so
presently
the
harmonium
player
came
in
i
may
play
my
loudest
father
he
said
but
no
one
will
hear
he
laughed
settled
the
pin
joan
of
arc
s
face
in
metal
in
his
azure
blue
necktie
and
added
nom
d
un
chien
the
wind
s
a
cruel
wedding
guest
the
priest
nodded
without
speaking
would
you
believe
father
the
man
continued
that
mademoiselle
and
her
husband
are
going
to
start
for
arba
from
the
church
door
in
all
this
storm
batouch
is
getting
the
palanquin
on
to
the
camel
how
they
will
ever
hush
said
the
priest
holding
up
a
warning
finger
this
idle
chatter
displeased
him
in
the
church
but
he
had
another
reason
for
wishing
to
stop
the
conversation
it
renewed
his
dread
to
hear
of
the
projected
journey
and
made
him
see
as
in
a
shadowy
vision
domini
enfilden
s
figure
disappearing
into
the
windy
desolation
of
the
desert
protected
by
the
living
mystery
he
hated
yes
at
this
moment
he
no
longer
denied
it
to
himself
there
was
something
in
androvsky
that
he
actually
hated
with
his
whole
soul
hated
even
in
his
church
at
the
very
threshold
of
the
altar
where
stood
the
tabernacle
containing
the
sacred
host
as
he
thoroughly
realised
this
for
a
moment
he
was
shocked
at
himself
recoiled
mentally
from
his
own
feeling
but
then
something
within
him
seemed
to
rise
up
and
say
perhaps
it
is
because
you
are
near
to
the
host
that
you
hate
this
man
perhaps
you
are
right
to
hate
him
when
he
draws
nigh
to
the
body
of
nevertheless
when
some
minutes
later
he
stood
within
the
altar
rails
and
saw
the
face
of
domini
he
was
conscious
of
another
thought
that
came
through
his
mind
dark
with
doubt
like
a
ray
of
gold
can
i
be
right
in
hating
what
this
good
woman
this
woman
whose
confession
i
have
received
whose
heart
i
know
can
i
be
right
in
hating
what
she
loves
in
fearing
what
she
trusts
in
secretly
condemning
what
she
openly
enthrones
and
almost
in
despite
of
himself
he
felt
reassured
for
an
instant
even
happy
in
the
thought
of
what
he
was
about
to
do
domini
s
face
at
all
times
suggested
strength
the
mental
and
emotional
power
of
her
were
forcibly
expressed
too
through
her
tall
and
athletic
body
which
was
full
of
easy
grace
but
full
too
of
firmness
she
looked
not
unlike
a
splendid
amazon
who
could
have
been
a
splendid
nun
had
she
entered
into
religion
as
she
stood
there
by
androvsky
simply
dressed
for
the
wild
journey
that
was
before
her
the
slight
hint
in
her
personality
of
a
spartan
youth
that
stamped
her
with
a
very
definite
originality
was
blended
with
even
transfigured
by
a
womanliness
so
intense
as
to
be
almost
fierce
a
womanliness
that
had
the
fervour
the
glowing
vigour
of
a
glory
that
had
suddenly
become
fully
aware
of
itself
and
of
all
the
deeds
that
it
could
not
only
conceive
but
do
she
was
triumph
embodied
in
the
flesh
not
the
triumph
that
is
a
but
that
spreads
wings
conscious
at
last
that
the
human
being
has
kinship
with
the
angels
and
need
not
should
not
wait
for
death
to
seek
bravely
their
comradeship
she
was
love
triumphant
woman
utterly
fearless
because
instinctively
aware
that
she
was
fulflling
her
divine
mission
as
he
gazed
at
her
the
priest
had
a
strange
thought
of
how
christ
s
face
must
have
looked
when
he
said
lazarus
come
forth
androvsky
stood
by
her
but
the
priest
did
not
look
at
him
the
wind
roared
round
the
church
the
narrow
windows
rattled
and
the
clouds
of
sand
driven
against
them
made
a
pattering
as
of
fingers
tapping
frantically
upon
the
glass
the
curtains
trembled
and
the
dusty
pink
ribands
tied
round
the
ropes
of
the
chandeliers
shook
incessantly
to
and
fro
as
if
striving
to
escape
and
to
join
the
multitudes
of
torn
and
disfigured
things
that
were
swept
through
space
by
the
breath
of
the
storm
beyond
the
windows
vaguely
seen
at
moments
through
the
clouds
of
sand
the
outlines
of
the
palm
leaves
wavered
descended
rose
darted
from
side
to
side
like
hands
of
the
demented
suzanne
who
was
one
of
the
witnesses
trembled
and
moved
her
full
lips
nervously
she
disapproved
utterly
of
her
mistress
wedding
and
still
more
of
a
honeymoon
in
the
desert
for
herself
she
did
not
care
very
shortly
she
was
going
to
marry
monsieur
helmuth
the
important
person
in
livery
who
accompanied
the
hotel
omnibus
to
the
station
and
meanwhile
she
was
to
remain
at
under
the
chaperonage
of
madame
armande
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
but
it
shocked
her
that
a
mistress
of
hers
and
a
member
of
the
english
aristocracy
should
be
married
in
a
costume
suitable
for
a
camel
ride
and
should
start
off
to
go
to
bon
alone
knew
where
shut
up
in
a
palanquin
like
any
black
woman
covered
with
lumps
of
coral
and
bracelets
like
handcuffs
the
other
witnesses
were
the
mayor
of
a
doctor
who
wore
the
conventional
of
french
ceremony
and
looked
as
if
the
wind
had
made
him
as
sleepy
as
a
bear
on
the
point
of
hibernating
and
the
son
of
madame
armande
a
lively
young
man
with
a
bullet
head
and
eager
black
eyes
the
latter
took
a
keen
interest
in
the
ceremony
but
the
mayor
blinked
pathetically
and
occasionally
rubbed
his
large
hooked
nose
as
if
imploring
it
to
keep
his
whole
person
from
drooping
down
into
a
heavy
doze
the
priest
speaking
in
a
conventional
voice
that
was
strangely
inexpressive
of
his
inward
emotion
asked
androvsky
and
domini
whether
they
would
take
each
other
for
wife
and
husband
and
listened
to
their
replies
androvsky
s
voice
sounded
to
him
hard
and
cold
as
ice
when
it
replied
and
suddenly
he
thought
of
the
storm
as
raging
in
some
northern
land
over
snowbound
wastes
whose
scanty
trees
were
leafless
but
domini
s
voice
was
clear
and
warm
as
the
sun
that
would
shine
again
over
the
desert
when
the
storm
was
past
the
mayor
constraining
himself
to
keep
awake
a
little
longer
gave
domini
away
while
suzanne
dropped
tears
into
a
edged
with
frilling
the
gift
of
monsieur
helmuth
then
when
the
troth
had
been
plighted
in
the
midst
of
a
more
passionate
roaring
of
the
wind
the
priest
conquering
a
terrible
inward
reluctance
that
beset
him
despite
his
endeavour
to
feel
detached
and
formal
merely
a
priest
engaged
in
a
ceremony
that
it
was
his
office
to
carry
out
but
in
which
he
had
no
personal
interest
spoke
the
fateful
words
conjungo
vos
in
matrimonium
in
nomine
patris
et
filii
et
spiritus
sancti
he
said
this
without
looking
at
the
man
and
woman
who
stood
before
him
the
man
on
the
right
hand
and
the
woman
on
the
left
but
when
he
lifted
his
hand
to
sprinkle
them
with
holy
water
he
could
not
forbear
glancing
at
them
and
he
saw
domini
as
a
shining
radiance
but
androvsky
as
a
thing
of
stone
with
a
movement
that
seemed
to
the
priest
sinister
in
its
oppressed
deliberation
androvsky
placed
gold
and
silver
upon
the
book
and
the
marriage
ring
the
priest
spoke
again
slowly
in
the
uproar
of
the
wind
after
blessing
the
ring
nostrum
in
nomine
after
the
reply
the
exaudi
orationem
the
the
and
the
cum
spiritu
the
and
the
prayer
following
he
sprinkled
the
ring
with
holy
water
in
the
form
of
a
cross
and
gave
it
to
androvsky
to
give
with
gold
and
silver
to
domini
androvsky
took
the
ring
repeated
the
formula
with
this
ring
then
still
as
it
seemed
to
the
priest
with
the
same
sinister
deliberation
placed
it
on
the
thumb
of
the
bride
s
uncovered
hand
saying
the
name
of
the
then
on
her
second
finger
saying
the
then
on
her
third
finger
saying
the
holy
then
on
her
fourth
finger
but
at
this
moment
when
he
should
have
said
there
was
a
long
pause
of
silence
during
it
why
he
did
not
know
the
priest
found
himself
thinking
of
the
saying
of
isidore
of
seville
that
the
ring
of
marriage
is
left
on
the
fourth
finger
of
the
bride
s
hand
because
that
finger
contains
a
vein
directly
connected
with
the
heart
androvsky
had
spoken
the
priest
started
and
went
on
with
the
hoc
and
from
this
point
until
the
christum
dominum
nostrum
which
since
there
was
no
mass
closed
the
ceremony
he
felt
more
master
of
himself
and
his
emotions
than
at
any
time
previously
during
this
day
a
sensation
of
finality
of
the
irrevocable
came
to
him
he
said
within
himself
this
matter
has
passed
out
of
my
hands
into
the
hands
of
and
in
the
midst
of
the
violence
of
the
storm
a
calm
stole
upon
his
spirit
god
knows
best
he
said
within
himself
god
knows
best
those
words
and
the
state
of
feeling
that
was
linked
with
them
were
and
had
always
been
to
him
as
mighty
protecting
arms
that
uplifted
him
above
the
beating
waves
of
the
sea
of
life
the
wedding
march
sounded
when
the
priest
bade
to
the
husband
and
wife
whom
he
had
made
one
he
was
able
to
do
it
tranquilly
he
even
pressed
androvsky
s
hand
be
good
to
her
he
said
she
is
she
is
a
good
to
his
surprise
androvsky
suddenly
wrung
his
hand
almost
passionately
and
the
priest
saw
that
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
that
night
the
priest
prayed
long
and
earnestly
for
all
wanderers
in
the
desert
when
domini
and
androvsky
came
out
from
the
church
they
saw
vaguely
a
camel
lying
down
before
the
door
bending
its
head
and
snarling
fiercely
upon
its
back
was
a
palanquin
of
stuff
with
a
roof
of
stuff
stretched
upon
strong
curved
sticks
and
curtains
which
could
be
drawn
or
undrawn
at
pleasure
the
desert
men
crowded
about
it
like
eager
phantoms
in
the
wind
half
seen
in
the
driving
mist
of
sand
clinging
to
androvsky
s
arm
domini
struggled
forward
to
the
camel
as
she
did
so
smain
unfolding
for
an
instant
his
burnous
pressed
into
her
hands
his
mass
of
roses
she
thanked
him
with
a
smile
he
scarcely
saw
and
a
word
that
was
borne
away
upon
the
wind
at
larbi
s
lips
she
saw
the
little
flute
and
his
thick
fingers
fluttering
upon
the
holes
she
knew
that
he
was
playing
his
for
her
but
she
could
not
hear
it
except
in
her
heart
the
sprinkled
her
gravely
with
essence
and
for
a
moment
she
felt
as
if
she
were
again
in
his
dark
bazaar
and
seemed
to
catch
among
the
voices
of
the
storm
the
sound
of
men
muttering
prayers
to
allah
as
in
the
mosque
of
then
she
was
in
the
palanquin
with
androvsky
close
beside
her
at
this
moment
batouch
took
hold
of
the
curtains
of
the
palanquin
to
draw
them
close
but
she
put
out
her
hand
and
stopped
him
she
wanted
to
see
the
last
of
the
church
of
the
tormented
gardens
she
had
learnt
to
love
he
looked
astonished
but
yielded
to
her
gesture
and
told
the
to
make
the
animal
rise
to
its
feet
the
driver
took
his
stick
and
plied
it
crying
out
the
camel
turned
its
head
towards
him
showing
its
teeth
and
snarling
with
a
sort
of
dreary
passion
shouted
the
driver
the
camel
began
to
get
up
as
it
did
so
from
the
shrouded
group
of
desert
men
one
started
forward
to
the
palanquin
throwing
off
his
burnous
and
gesticulating
with
thin
naked
arms
as
if
about
to
commit
some
violent
act
it
was
the
made
fantastic
and
unreal
by
the
whirling
sand
grains
domini
saw
his
lean
face
pitted
with
his
eyes
blazing
with
an
intelligence
that
was
demoniacal
fixed
upon
her
the
long
wound
that
stretched
from
his
cheek
to
his
forehead
the
pleading
that
had
been
mingled
with
the
almost
tyrannical
command
of
his
demeanour
had
vanished
now
he
looked
ferocious
arbitrary
like
a
savage
of
genius
full
of
some
frightful
message
of
warning
or
rebuke
as
the
camel
rose
he
cried
aloud
some
words
in
arabic
domini
heard
his
voice
but
could
not
understand
the
words
laying
his
hands
on
the
stuff
of
the
palanquin
he
shouted
again
then
took
away
his
hands
and
shook
them
above
his
head
towards
the
desert
still
staring
at
domini
with
his
fanatical
eyes
the
wind
shrieked
the
sand
grains
whirled
in
spirals
about
his
body
the
camel
began
to
move
away
from
the
church
slowly
towards
the
village
cried
the
in
the
storm
his
call
sounded
like
a
wail
of
despair
chapter
xvii
as
the
voice
of
the
diviner
fainted
away
on
the
wind
and
the
vision
of
his
wounded
face
and
piercing
eyes
was
lost
in
the
whirling
sand
grains
androvsky
stretched
out
his
hand
and
drew
together
the
heavy
curtains
of
the
palanquin
the
world
was
shut
out
they
were
alone
for
the
first
time
as
man
and
wife
moving
deliberately
on
this
beast
they
could
not
see
but
whose
slow
and
monotonous
gait
swung
them
gently
to
and
fro
out
from
the
last
traces
of
civilisation
into
the
life
of
the
sands
with
each
soft
step
the
camel
took
they
went
a
little
farther
from
came
a
little
nearer
to
that
liberty
of
which
domini
sometimes
dreamed
to
the
smiling
eyes
and
the
lifted
spheres
of
fire
she
shut
her
eyes
now
she
did
not
want
to
see
her
husband
or
to
touch
his
hand
she
did
not
want
to
speak
she
only
wanted
to
feel
in
the
uttermost
depths
of
her
spirit
this
movement
steady
and
persistent
towards
the
goal
of
her
earthly
desires
to
realise
absolutely
the
marvellous
truth
that
after
years
of
lovelessness
and
a
dreaminess
more
benumbing
than
acute
misery
happiness
more
intense
than
any
she
had
been
able
to
conceive
of
in
her
moments
of
greatest
yearning
was
being
poured
into
her
heart
that
she
was
being
taken
to
the
place
where
she
would
be
with
the
one
human
being
whose
presence
blotted
out
even
the
memory
of
the
false
world
and
gave
to
her
the
true
and
whereas
in
the
dead
years
she
had
sometimes
been
afraid
of
feeling
too
much
the
emptiness
and
the
desolation
of
her
life
she
was
now
afraid
of
feeling
too
little
its
fulness
and
its
splendour
was
afraid
of
some
day
looking
back
to
this
superb
moment
of
her
earthly
fate
and
being
conscious
that
she
had
not
grasped
its
meaning
till
it
was
gone
that
she
had
done
that
most
terrible
of
all
things
realised
that
she
had
been
happy
to
the
limits
of
her
capacity
for
happiness
only
when
her
happiness
was
numbered
with
the
past
but
could
that
ever
be
was
time
such
time
as
this
not
eternity
could
such
earthly
things
as
this
intense
joy
ever
have
been
and
no
longer
be
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
could
not
be
so
she
felt
like
one
who
held
eternity
s
hand
and
went
out
with
that
great
guide
into
the
endlessness
of
supreme
perfection
for
her
just
then
the
creator
s
scheme
was
rounded
to
a
flawless
circle
all
things
fell
into
order
stars
and
men
the
silent
growing
things
the
seas
the
mountains
and
the
plains
fell
into
order
like
a
vast
choir
to
obey
the
command
of
the
canticle
benedicite
omnia
opera
bless
ye
the
lord
the
roaring
of
the
wind
about
the
palanquin
became
the
dominant
voice
of
this
choir
in
domini
s
ears
bless
ye
the
lord
it
was
obedient
not
as
the
slave
but
as
the
free
will
is
obedient
as
her
heart
which
joined
its
voice
with
this
wind
of
the
desert
was
obedient
because
it
gloriously
chose
with
all
its
powers
passions
aspirations
to
be
so
the
real
obedience
is
only
love
fulfilling
its
last
desire
and
this
great
song
was
the
fulfilling
of
the
last
desire
of
all
created
things
domini
knew
that
she
did
not
realise
the
joy
of
this
moment
of
her
life
now
when
she
felt
no
longer
that
she
was
a
woman
but
only
that
she
was
a
living
praise
winging
upward
to
god
a
warm
strong
hand
clasped
hers
she
opened
her
eyes
in
the
dim
twilight
of
the
palanquin
she
saw
the
darkness
of
androvsky
s
tall
figure
sitting
in
the
crouched
attitude
rendered
necessary
by
the
peculiar
seat
and
swaying
slightly
to
the
movement
of
the
camel
the
light
was
so
obscure
that
she
could
not
see
his
eyes
or
clearly
discern
his
features
but
she
felt
that
he
was
gazing
at
her
shadowy
figure
that
his
mind
was
passionately
at
work
had
he
too
been
silently
praising
god
for
his
happiness
and
was
he
now
wishing
the
body
to
join
in
the
soul
s
delight
she
left
her
hand
in
his
passively
the
sense
of
her
womanhood
lost
for
a
moment
in
the
ecstasy
of
worship
had
returned
to
her
but
with
a
new
and
tremendous
meaning
which
seemed
to
change
her
nature
androvsky
forcibly
pressed
her
hand
with
his
let
it
go
then
pressed
it
again
repeating
the
action
with
a
regularity
that
seemed
suggested
by
some
guidance
she
imagined
him
pressing
her
hand
each
time
his
heart
pulsed
she
did
not
want
to
return
the
pressure
as
she
felt
his
hand
thus
closing
and
unclosing
over
hers
she
was
conscious
that
she
who
in
their
intercourse
had
played
a
dominant
part
who
had
even
deliberately
brought
about
that
intercourse
by
her
action
on
the
tower
now
longed
to
be
passive
and
forgetting
her
own
power
and
the
strength
and
force
of
her
nature
to
lose
herself
in
the
greater
strength
and
force
of
this
man
to
whom
she
had
given
herself
never
before
had
she
wished
to
be
anything
but
strong
nor
did
she
desire
weakness
now
but
only
that
his
nature
should
rise
above
hers
with
eagle
s
wings
that
when
she
looked
up
she
should
see
him
never
when
she
looked
down
she
thought
that
to
see
him
below
her
would
kill
her
and
she
opened
her
lips
to
say
so
but
something
in
the
windy
darkness
kept
her
silent
the
heavy
curtains
of
the
palanquin
shook
perpetually
and
the
tall
wooden
rods
on
which
they
were
slung
creaked
making
a
small
incessant
noise
like
a
complaining
which
joined
itself
with
the
more
distant
but
louder
noise
made
by
the
leaves
of
the
thousands
of
palm
trees
dashed
furiously
together
from
behind
came
the
groaning
of
one
of
the
camels
borne
on
the
gusts
of
the
wind
and
faint
sounds
of
the
calling
voices
of
the
arabs
who
accompanied
them
it
was
not
a
time
to
speak
she
wondered
where
they
were
in
what
part
of
the
oasis
whether
they
had
yet
gained
the
beginning
of
the
great
route
which
had
always
fascinated
her
and
which
was
now
the
road
to
the
goal
of
all
her
earthly
desires
but
there
was
nothing
to
tell
her
she
travelled
in
a
world
of
dimness
and
the
roar
of
wind
and
in
this
obscurity
and
uproar
combined
with
perpetual
though
slight
motion
she
lost
all
count
of
time
she
had
no
idea
how
long
it
was
since
she
had
come
out
of
the
church
door
with
androvsky
at
first
she
thought
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
and
that
the
camels
must
be
just
coming
to
the
statue
of
the
cardinal
then
she
thought
that
it
might
be
an
hour
even
more
that
count
anteoni
s
garden
was
long
since
left
behind
and
that
they
were
passing
perhaps
along
the
narrow
streets
of
the
village
of
old
and
nearing
the
edge
of
the
oasis
but
even
in
this
confusion
of
mind
she
felt
that
something
would
tell
her
when
the
last
palms
had
vanished
in
the
sand
mist
and
the
caravan
came
out
into
the
desert
the
sound
of
the
wind
would
surely
be
different
when
they
met
it
on
the
immense
flats
where
there
was
nothing
to
break
its
fury
or
even
if
it
were
not
different
she
felt
that
she
would
know
that
the
desert
would
surely
speak
to
her
in
the
moment
when
at
last
it
took
her
to
itself
it
could
not
be
that
they
would
be
taken
by
the
desert
and
she
not
know
it
but
she
wanted
androvsky
to
know
it
too
for
she
felt
that
the
moment
when
the
desert
took
them
man
and
wife
would
be
a
great
moment
in
their
lives
greater
even
than
that
in
which
they
met
as
they
came
into
the
blue
country
and
she
set
herself
to
listen
with
a
passionate
expectation
with
an
attention
so
close
and
determined
that
it
thrilled
her
body
and
even
affected
her
muscles
what
she
was
listening
for
was
a
rising
of
the
wind
a
crescendo
of
its
voice
she
was
anticipating
a
triumphant
cry
from
the
sahara
unlimited
power
made
audible
in
a
sound
like
the
blowing
of
the
clarion
of
the
sands
androvsky
s
hand
was
still
on
hers
but
now
it
did
not
move
as
if
obeying
the
pulsations
of
his
heart
it
held
hers
closely
warmly
and
sent
his
strength
to
her
and
presently
for
an
instant
taking
her
mind
from
the
desert
she
lost
herself
in
the
mystery
and
the
wonder
of
human
companionship
she
realised
that
the
touch
of
androvsky
s
hand
on
hers
altered
for
her
herself
and
the
whole
universe
as
it
was
presented
to
her
as
she
observed
and
felt
it
nothing
remained
as
it
was
when
he
did
not
touch
her
there
was
something
stupefying
in
the
thought
something
almost
terrible
the
wonder
that
is
alive
in
the
tiny
things
of
love
and
that
makes
tremendously
important
their
presence
in
or
absence
from
a
woman
s
life
took
hold
on
her
completely
for
the
first
time
and
set
her
forever
in
a
changed
world
a
world
in
which
a
great
knowledge
ruled
instead
of
a
great
ignorance
with
the
consciousness
of
exactly
what
androvsky
s
touch
meant
to
her
came
a
multiple
consciousness
of
a
thousand
other
things
all
connected
with
him
and
her
consecrated
relation
to
him
she
quivered
with
understanding
all
the
gates
of
her
soul
were
being
opened
and
the
white
light
of
comprehension
of
those
things
which
make
life
splendid
and
fruitful
was
pouring
in
upon
her
within
the
dim
contained
space
of
the
palanquin
that
was
slowly
carried
onward
through
the
passion
of
the
storm
there
was
an
effulgence
of
unseen
glory
that
grew
in
splendour
moment
by
moment
a
woman
was
being
born
of
a
woman
woman
who
knew
herself
of
woman
who
did
not
know
herself
woman
who
henceforth
would
divinely
love
her
womanhood
of
woman
who
had
often
wondered
why
she
had
been
created
woman
the
words
muttered
by
the
man
of
the
sand
in
count
anteoni
s
garden
were
coming
true
in
the
church
of
the
life
of
domini
had
begun
more
really
than
when
her
mother
strove
in
the
pains
of
childbirth
and
her
first
faint
cry
answered
the
voice
of
the
world
s
light
when
it
spoke
to
her
slowly
the
caravan
moved
on
the
sang
low
under
the
folds
of
their
haiks
those
mysterious
songs
of
the
east
that
seem
the
songs
of
heat
and
solitude
batouch
smothered
in
his
burnous
his
large
head
sunk
upon
his
chest
slumbered
like
a
potentate
relieved
from
cares
of
state
till
arba
was
reached
his
duty
was
accomplished
ali
perched
behind
him
on
the
camel
stared
into
the
dimness
with
eyes
steady
and
remote
as
those
of
a
vulture
of
the
desert
the
houses
of
faded
in
the
mist
of
the
sand
the
statue
of
the
cardinal
holding
the
double
cross
the
tower
of
the
hotel
the
shuddering
trees
of
count
anteoni
s
garden
along
the
white
blue
which
was
the
road
the
camels
painfully
advanced
urged
by
the
cries
and
the
sticks
of
the
running
drivers
presently
the
brown
buildings
of
old
came
partially
into
sight
peeping
here
and
there
through
the
flying
sands
and
the
frantic
palm
leaves
the
desert
was
at
hand
ali
began
to
sing
breathing
his
song
into
the
back
of
batouch
s
hood
the
love
of
women
is
like
the
holiday
song
that
the
boy
sings
gaily
in
the
sunny
garden
the
love
of
women
is
like
the
little
moon
the
little
happy
moon
in
the
last
night
of
ramadan
the
love
of
women
is
like
the
great
silence
that
steals
at
dusk
to
kiss
the
scented
blossoms
of
the
orange
tree
sit
thee
down
beneath
the
orange
tree
o
loving
man
that
thou
mayst
know
the
kiss
that
tells
the
love
of
women
janat
janat
janat
batouch
stirred
uneasily
pulled
his
hood
from
his
eyes
and
looked
into
the
storm
gravely
then
he
shifted
on
the
camel
s
hump
and
said
to
ali
how
shall
we
get
to
arba
the
wind
is
like
all
the
touaregs
going
to
battle
and
when
we
leave
the
oasis
the
wind
is
going
down
responded
ali
calmly
this
evening
the
roumis
can
lie
in
the
batouch
s
thick
lips
curled
with
sarcasm
he
spat
into
the
wind
blew
his
nose
in
his
burnous
and
answered
you
are
a
child
and
can
sing
a
pretty
song
but
ali
pointed
with
his
delicate
hand
towards
the
south
do
you
not
see
the
light
in
the
sky
batouch
stared
before
him
and
perceived
that
there
was
in
truth
a
lifting
of
the
darkness
beyond
a
whiteness
growing
where
the
desert
lay
as
we
come
into
the
desert
the
wind
will
fall
said
ali
and
again
he
began
to
sing
to
himself
janat
janat
janat
domini
could
not
see
the
light
in
the
south
and
no
premonition
warned
her
of
any
coming
abatement
of
the
storm
once
more
she
had
begun
to
listen
to
the
roaring
of
the
wind
and
to
wait
for
the
larger
voice
of
the
desert
for
the
triumphant
clarion
of
the
sands
that
would
announce
to
her
her
entry
with
androvsky
into
the
life
of
the
wastes
again
she
personified
the
sahara
but
now
more
vividly
than
ever
before
in
the
obscurity
she
seemed
to
see
it
far
away
like
a
great
heroic
figure
waiting
for
her
and
her
passion
waiting
in
a
region
of
gold
and
silken
airs
at
the
back
of
the
tempest
to
crown
her
life
with
a
joy
wide
as
its
dreamlike
spaces
to
teach
her
mind
the
inner
truths
that
lie
beyond
the
crowded
ways
of
men
and
to
open
her
heart
to
the
most
profound
messages
of
nature
she
listened
holding
androvsky
s
hand
and
she
felt
that
he
was
listening
too
with
an
intensity
strong
as
her
own
or
stronger
presently
his
hand
closed
upon
hers
more
tightly
almost
hurting
her
physically
as
it
did
so
she
glanced
up
but
not
at
him
and
noticed
that
the
curtains
of
the
palanquin
were
fluttering
less
fiercely
once
for
an
instant
they
were
almost
still
then
again
they
moved
as
if
tugged
by
invisible
hands
then
were
almost
still
once
more
at
the
same
time
the
wind
s
voice
sank
in
her
ears
like
a
music
dropping
downward
in
a
hollow
place
it
rose
but
swiftly
sank
a
second
time
to
a
softer
hush
and
she
perceived
in
the
curtained
enclosure
a
faintly
growing
light
which
enabled
her
to
see
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
left
the
church
her
husband
s
features
he
was
looking
at
her
with
an
expression
of
anticipation
in
which
there
was
awe
and
she
realised
that
in
her
expectation
of
the
welcome
of
the
desert
she
had
been
mistaken
she
had
listened
for
the
sounding
of
a
clarion
but
she
was
to
be
greeted
by
a
still
small
voice
she
understood
the
awe
in
her
husband
s
eyes
and
shared
it
and
she
knew
at
once
with
a
sudden
thrill
of
rapture
that
in
the
scheme
of
things
there
are
blessings
and
nobilities
undreamed
of
by
man
and
that
must
always
come
upon
him
with
a
glorious
shock
of
surprise
showing
him
the
poor
faultiness
of
what
he
had
thought
perhaps
his
most
magnificent
imaginings
elisha
sought
for
the
lord
in
the
fire
and
in
the
whirlwind
but
in
the
still
small
voice
onward
came
the
lord
incomparably
more
wonderful
than
what
she
had
waited
for
seemed
to
her
now
this
sudden
falling
of
the
storm
this
mystical
voice
that
came
to
them
out
of
the
heart
of
the
sands
telling
them
that
they
were
passing
at
last
into
the
arms
of
the
sahara
the
wind
sank
rapidly
the
light
grew
in
the
palanquin
from
without
the
voices
of
the
and
of
batouch
and
ali
talking
together
reached
their
ears
distinctly
yet
they
remained
silent
it
seemed
as
if
they
feared
by
speech
to
break
the
spell
of
the
calm
that
was
flowing
around
them
as
if
they
feared
to
interrupt
the
murmur
of
the
desert
domini
now
returned
the
gaze
of
her
husband
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
his
for
she
wished
him
to
read
all
the
joy
that
was
in
her
heart
she
wished
him
to
penetrate
her
thoughts
to
understand
her
desires
to
be
at
one
with
the
woman
who
had
been
born
on
the
eve
of
the
passing
of
the
wind
with
the
coming
of
this
mystic
calm
was
coming
surely
something
else
the
silence
was
bringing
with
it
the
fusing
of
two
natures
the
desert
in
this
moment
was
drawing
together
two
souls
into
a
union
which
time
and
death
would
have
no
power
to
destroy
presently
the
wind
completely
died
away
only
a
faint
breeze
fluttered
the
curtains
of
the
palanquin
and
the
light
that
penetrated
between
them
here
and
there
was
no
longer
white
but
sparkled
with
a
tiny
dust
of
gold
then
androvsky
moved
to
open
the
curtains
and
domini
spoke
for
the
first
time
since
their
marriage
wait
she
said
in
a
low
voice
he
dropped
his
hand
obediently
and
looked
at
her
with
inquiry
in
his
eyes
don
t
let
us
look
till
we
are
far
out
she
said
far
away
from
he
made
no
answer
but
she
saw
that
he
understood
all
that
was
in
her
heart
he
leaned
a
little
nearer
to
her
and
stretched
out
his
arm
as
if
to
put
it
round
her
but
he
did
not
put
it
round
her
and
she
knew
why
he
was
husbanding
his
great
joy
as
she
had
husbanded
the
dark
hours
of
the
previous
night
that
to
her
were
golden
and
that
unfinished
action
that
impulse
unfulfilled
showed
her
more
clearly
the
depths
of
his
passion
for
her
even
than
had
the
desperate
clasp
of
his
hands
about
her
knees
in
the
garden
that
which
he
did
not
do
now
was
the
greatest
assertion
possible
of
all
that
he
would
do
in
the
life
that
was
before
them
and
made
her
feel
how
entirely
she
belonged
to
him
something
within
her
trembled
like
a
poor
child
before
whom
is
suddenly
set
the
prospect
of
a
day
of
perfect
happiness
she
thought
of
the
ending
of
this
day
of
the
coming
of
the
evening
always
the
darkness
had
parted
them
at
the
ending
of
this
day
it
would
unite
them
in
androvsky
s
eyes
she
read
her
thought
of
the
darkness
reflected
reflected
and
yet
changed
transmuted
by
sex
it
was
as
if
at
that
moment
she
read
the
same
story
written
in
two
ways
by
a
woman
and
by
a
man
as
if
she
saw
eden
not
only
as
eve
saw
it
but
as
adam
a
long
time
passed
but
they
did
not
feel
it
to
be
long
when
their
camel
halted
they
unclasped
their
hands
slowly
like
sleepers
reluctantly
awaking
they
heard
batouch
s
voice
outside
the
palanquin
madame
he
called
madame
what
is
it
asked
domini
stifling
a
sigh
madame
should
draw
the
curtains
we
are
halfway
to
arba
it
is
time
for
i
will
make
the
camel
of
madame
lie
a
loud
rose
up
followed
by
a
fierce
groaning
from
the
camel
and
a
lethargic
yet
violent
movement
that
threw
them
forward
and
backward
they
sank
a
hand
from
without
pulled
back
the
curtains
and
light
streamed
over
them
they
set
their
feet
in
sand
stood
up
and
looked
about
them
already
they
were
far
out
in
the
desert
though
not
yet
beyond
the
limit
of
the
range
of
red
mountains
which
stretched
forward
upon
their
left
but
at
no
great
distance
beyond
them
ended
in
the
sands
the
camels
were
lying
down
in
a
faintly
defined
track
which
was
bordered
upon
either
side
by
the
plain
covered
with
little
humps
of
sandy
soil
on
which
grew
dusty
shrub
above
them
was
a
sky
of
faint
blue
heavy
with
banks
of
clouds
towards
the
east
and
over
their
heads
dressed
in
wispy
veils
of
vaporous
white
through
which
the
blue
peered
in
sections
that
grew
larger
as
they
looked
towards
the
south
where
arba
lay
on
a
low
hill
of
earth
without
grass
or
trees
beyond
a
mound
covered
thickly
with
tamarisk
bushes
which
was
a
for
immense
herds
of
camels
the
blue
was
clear
and
the
light
of
the
sun
intense
a
delicate
breeze
travelled
about
them
stirring
the
bushes
and
the
robes
of
the
arabs
who
were
throwing
back
their
hoods
and
uncovering
their
mouths
and
smiling
at
them
but
seriously
as
arabs
alone
can
smile
beside
them
stood
two
white
and
yellow
guard
dogs
blinking
and
looking
weary
for
a
moment
they
stood
still
blinking
too
almost
like
the
dogs
the
change
to
this
immensity
and
light
from
the
narrow
darkness
of
the
palanquin
overwhelmed
their
senses
they
said
nothing
but
only
stared
silently
then
domini
with
a
large
gesture
stretched
her
arms
above
her
head
drawing
a
deep
breath
which
ended
in
a
little
almost
sobbing
laugh
of
exultation
out
of
prison
she
said
disconnectedly
out
of
prison
into
this
suddenly
she
turned
upon
androvsky
and
caught
his
arm
and
twined
both
of
her
arms
round
it
with
a
strong
confidence
that
was
careless
of
everything
in
the
intensity
of
its
happiness
all
my
life
i
ve
been
in
prison
she
said
you
ve
unlocked
the
door
and
then
as
suddenly
as
she
had
caught
his
arm
she
let
it
go
something
surged
up
in
her
making
her
almost
afraid
or
if
not
that
confused
it
was
as
if
her
nature
were
a
horse
taking
the
bit
between
its
teeth
preparatory
to
a
tremendous
gallop
whither
she
did
not
know
she
was
intoxicated
by
the
growing
light
the
sharp
delicious
air
the
huge
spaces
around
her
the
solitude
with
this
man
who
held
her
soul
surely
in
his
hands
she
had
always
connected
him
with
the
desert
now
he
was
hers
into
the
desert
and
the
desert
was
hers
with
him
but
was
it
possible
could
such
a
fate
have
been
held
in
reserve
for
her
she
scarcely
dared
even
to
try
to
realise
the
meaning
of
her
situation
lest
at
a
breath
it
should
be
changed
just
then
she
felt
that
if
she
ventured
to
weigh
and
measure
her
wonderful
gift
androvsky
would
fall
dead
at
her
feet
and
the
desert
be
folded
together
like
a
scroll
there
is
madame
said
batouch
she
was
glad
he
spoke
to
her
turned
and
followed
with
her
eyes
his
pointing
hand
far
off
she
saw
a
green
darkness
of
palms
and
above
it
a
white
tower
small
from
here
as
the
tower
of
a
castle
of
dolls
the
tower
she
said
to
androvsky
we
first
spoke
in
it
we
must
bid
it
she
made
a
gesture
of
farewell
towards
it
androvsky
watched
the
movement
of
her
hand
she
noticed
now
that
she
made
no
movement
that
he
did
not
observe
with
a
sort
of
passionate
attention
the
desert
did
not
exist
for
him
she
saw
that
in
his
eyes
he
did
not
look
towards
the
tower
even
when
she
repeated
we
must
we
owe

batouch
and
ali
were
busy
spreading
a
cloth
upon
the
sand
making
it
firm
with
little
stones
taking
out
food
plates
knives
glasses
bottles
from
a
great
basket
slung
on
one
of
the
camels
they
moved
deftly
seriously
intent
upon
their
task
the
were
loosening
the
cords
that
bound
the
loads
upon
their
beasts
who
roared
venomously
opening
their
mouths
showing
long
decayed
teeth
and
turning
their
heads
from
side
to
side
with
a
serpentine
movement
domini
and
androvsky
were
not
watched
for
a
moment
why
won
t
you
look
why
won
t
you
say
she
asked
coming
nearer
to
him
on
the
sand
softly
with
a
woman
s
longing
to
hear
him
explain
what
she
understood
what
do
i
care
for
it
or
the
palms
or
the
sky
or
the
desert
he
answered
almost
savagely
what
can
i
care
if
you
were
mine
behind
iron
bars
in
that
prison
you
spoke
of
don
t
you
think
it
s
enough
for
me
too
much
a
cup
running
over
and
he
added
some
words
under
his
breath
words
she
could
not
hear
not
even
the
desert
she
said
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
it
s
all
in
you
everything
s
in
you
everything
that
brought
us
together
that
we
ve
watched
and
wanted
but
then
she
said
and
now
her
voice
was
very
quiet
am
i
peace
for
you
peace
said
androvsky
yes
don
t
you
remember
once
i
said
that
there
must
be
peace
in
the
desert
then
is
it
in
me
for
you
peace
he
repeated
i
can
t
think
of
peace
or
want
it
don
t
you
ask
too
much
of
me
let
me
live
live
as
only
a
man
can
who
let
me
live
with
all
that
is
in
me
domini
men
ask
to
die
in
peace
oh
domini
domini
his
expression
was
like
arms
that
crushed
her
lips
that
pressed
her
mouth
a
heart
that
beat
on
hers
madame
est
servie
cried
batouch
in
a
merry
voice
his
mistress
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
he
cried
again
madame
est
servie
then
domini
turned
round
and
came
to
the
first
meal
in
the
sand
two
cushions
lay
beside
the
cloth
upon
an
arab
quilt
of
white
red
and
orange
colour
upon
the
cloth
in
vases
of
rough
pottery
stained
with
designs
in
purple
were
arranged
the
roses
brought
by
smain
from
count
anteoni
s
garden
our
wedding
breakfast
domini
said
under
her
breath
she
felt
just
then
as
if
she
were
living
in
a
wonderful
romance
they
sat
down
side
by
side
and
ate
with
a
good
appetite
served
by
batouch
and
ali
now
and
then
a
pale
yellow
butterfly
yellow
as
the
sand
flitted
by
them
small
yellow
birds
with
crested
heads
ran
swiftly
among
the
scrub
or
flew
low
over
the
flats
in
the
sky
the
vapours
gathered
themselves
together
and
moved
slowly
away
towards
the
east
leaving
the
blue
above
their
heads
unflecked
with
white
with
each
moment
the
heat
of
the
sun
grew
more
intense
the
wind
had
gone
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
it
had
ever
roared
over
the
desert
a
little
way
from
them
the
squatted
beside
the
beasts
eating
flat
loaves
of
yellow
bread
and
talking
together
in
low
guttural
voices
the
guard
dogs
roamed
round
them
uneasily
hungry
in
the
distance
before
a
tent
of
patched
rags
a
woman
scantily
clad
in
bright
red
cotton
was
suckling
a
child
and
staring
at
the
caravan
domini
and
androvsky
scarcely
spoke
as
they
ate
once
she
said
do
you
realise
that
this
is
a
wedding
breakfast
she
was
thinking
of
the
many
wedding
receptions
she
had
attended
in
london
of
crowds
of
women
staring
enviously
at
tiaras
and
sets
of
jewels
arranged
in
cases
upon
tables
of
brides
and
bridegrooms
looking
flushed
and
anxious
standing
under
canopies
of
flowers
and
forcing
their
tired
lips
into
smiles
as
they
replied
to
stereotyped
congratulations
while
detectives
poorly
disguised
as
gentlemen
hovered
in
the
to
see
that
none
of
the
presents
mysteriously
disappeared
her
presents
were
the
velvety
roses
in
the
earthen
vases
the
breezes
of
the
desert
the
sand
humps
the
yellow
butterflies
the
silence
that
lay
around
like
a
blessing
pronounced
by
the
god
who
made
the
still
places
where
souls
can
learn
to
know
themselves
and
their
great
destiny
a
wedding
breakfast
androvsky
said
yes
but
perhaps
you
have
never
been
to
then
you
can
t
love
this
one
as
much
as
i
much
more
he
answered
she
looked
at
him
remembering
how
often
in
the
past
when
she
had
been
feeling
intensely
she
had
it
borne
in
upon
her
that
he
was
feeling
even
more
intensely
than
herself
but
could
that
be
possible
now
do
you
think
she
said
that
it
is
possible
for
you
who
have
never
lived
in
cities
to
love
this
land
as
i
love
it
androvsky
moved
on
his
cushion
and
leaned
down
till
his
elbow
touched
the
sand
lying
thus
with
his
chin
in
his
hand
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
he
answered
but
it
is
not
the
land
i
am
his
absolute
concentration
upon
her
made
her
think
that
perhaps
he
misunderstood
her
meaning
in
speaking
of
the
desert
her
joy
in
it
she
longed
to
explain
how
he
and
the
desert
were
linked
together
in
her
heart
and
she
dropped
her
hand
upon
his
left
hand
which
lay
palm
downwards
in
the
warm
sand
i
love
this
land
she
began
because
i
found
you
in
it
because
i
feel
she
stopped
yes
domini
he
said
no
not
now
i
can
t
tell
you
there
s
too
much
domini
he
repeated
then
they
were
silent
once
more
thinking
of
how
the
darkness
would
come
to
them
at
arba
in
the
late
afternoon
they
drew
near
to
the
bordj
moving
along
a
difficult
route
full
of
deep
ruts
and
holes
and
bordered
on
either
side
by
bushes
so
tall
that
they
looked
almost
like
trees
here
tended
by
arabs
who
stared
gravely
at
the
strangers
in
the
palanquin
were
grazing
immense
herds
of
camels
above
the
bushes
to
the
horizon
on
either
side
of
the
way
appeared
the
serpentine
necks
flexibly
moving
to
and
fro
now
bending
deliberately
towards
the
dusty
twigs
now
stretched
straight
forward
as
if
in
patient
search
for
some
solace
of
the
camel
s
fate
that
lay
in
the
remoteness
of
the
desert
baby
camels
many
of
them
only
a
few
days
old
yet
already
vowed
to
the
eternal
pilgrimages
of
the
wastes
with
mild
faces
and
long
legs
ran
from
the
caravan
nervously
seeking
their
morose
mothers
who
cast
upon
them
glances
that
seemed
expressive
of
a
disdainful
pity
in
front
beyond
a
watercourse
now
dried
up
rose
the
low
hill
on
which
stood
the
bordj
a
huge
square
building
with
two
square
towers
pierced
with
loopholes
from
a
distance
it
resembled
a
fort
threatening
the
desert
in
magnificent
isolation
its
towers
were
black
against
the
clear
lemon
of
the
failing
sunlight
pigeons
that
looked
also
black
flew
perpetually
about
them
and
the
telegraph
posts
that
bordered
the
way
at
regular
intervals
on
the
left
made
a
diminishing
series
of
black
vertical
lines
sharply
cutting
the
yellow
till
they
were
lost
to
sight
in
the
south
to
domini
these
posts
were
like
pointing
fingers
beckoning
her
onward
to
the
farthest
distances
of
the
sun
drugged
by
the
long
journey
over
the
flats
and
the
unceasing
caress
of
the
air
that
was
like
an
importunate
lover
ever
unsatisfied
she
watched
from
the
height
on
which
she
was
perched
this
evening
scene
of
roaming
feeding
animals
staring
nomads
monotonous
herbage
and
vague
mountains
with
quiet
dreamy
eyes
everything
which
she
saw
seemed
to
her
beautiful
a
little
remote
and
a
little
fantastic
the
slow
movement
of
the
camels
the
swifter
movements
of
the
circling
pigeons
about
the
square
towers
on
the
hill
the
motionless
or
arabs
with
their
clubs
held
slantwise
the
telegraph
poles
one
smaller
than
the
other
diminishing
till
as
if
magically
they
disappeared
in
the
lemon
that
was
growing
into
gold
were
woven
together
for
her
by
the
shuttle
of
the
desert
into
a
softly
brilliant
tapestry
one
of
those
tapestries
that
is
like
a
legend
struck
to
sleep
as
the
beauty
in
her
palace
as
they
began
to
mount
the
hill
and
the
radiance
of
the
sky
increased
this
impression
faded
for
the
life
that
centred
round
the
bordj
was
vivid
though
sparse
in
comparison
with
the
eddying
life
of
towns
and
had
that
air
of
peculiar
concentration
which
may
be
noted
in
pictures
representing
a
halt
in
the
desert
no
longer
did
the
bordj
seem
to
domini
like
a
fort
threatening
the
oncomer
but
like
a
stalwart
host
welcoming
him
a
host
who
kept
open
house
in
this
treeless
desolation
that
yet
had
for
her
no
feature
that
was
desolate
it
was
built
of
stone
and
had
in
the
middle
of
the
facade
that
faced
them
an
immense
hospitable
doorway
with
a
white
arch
above
it
this
doorway
gave
a
partial
view
of
a
vast
courtyard
in
which
animals
and
people
were
moving
to
and
fro
round
about
under
the
sheltering
shadow
of
the
windowless
wall
were
many
arabs
some
squatting
on
their
haunches
some
standing
upright
with
their
backs
against
the
stone
some
moving
from
one
group
to
another
gesticulating
and
talking
vivaciously
boys
were
playing
a
game
with
stones
set
in
an
ordered
series
of
small
holes
scooped
by
their
fingers
in
the
dust
a
negro
crossed
the
flat
space
before
the
bordj
carrying
on
his
head
a
huge
earthen
vase
to
the
well
near
by
where
a
crowd
of
black
donkeys
just
relieved
of
their
loads
of
brushwood
was
being
watered
from
the
south
two
spahis
were
riding
in
on
white
horses
their
scarlet
cloaks
floating
out
over
their
saddles
and
from
the
west
moving
slowly
to
a
wailing
sound
of
indistinct
music
a
faint
beating
of
tomtoms
was
approaching
a
large
caravan
in
a
cloud
of
dust
which
floated
back
from
it
and
melted
away
into
the
radiance
of
the
sunset
when
they
gained
the
great
open
space
before
the
building
they
were
bathed
in
the
soft
golden
light
in
which
all
these
figures
of
africans
and
all
these
animals
looked
mysterious
and
beautiful
and
full
of
that
immeasurable
significance
which
the
desert
sheds
upon
those
who
move
in
it
specially
at
dawn
or
at
sundown
from
the
plateau
they
dominated
the
whole
of
the
plain
they
had
traversed
as
far
as
which
on
the
morrow
would
fade
into
the
blue
horizon
its
thousands
of
palms
made
a
darkness
in
the
gold
and
still
the
tower
of
the
hotel
was
faintly
visible
pointing
like
a
needle
towards
the
sky
the
range
of
mountains
showed
their
rosy
flanks
in
the
distance
they
too
on
the
morrow
would
be
lost
in
the
desert
spaces
the
last
outposts
of
the
world
of
hill
and
valley
of
stream
and
sea
only
in
the
deceptive
dream
of
the
mirage
would
they
appear
once
more
looming
in
a
shaking
veil
like
a
fluid
on
the
edge
of
some
visionary
lagune
domini
was
glad
that
on
this
first
night
of
their
journey
they
could
still
see
the
place
where
they
had
found
each
other
and
been
given
to
each
other
by
the
church
as
the
camel
stopped
before
the
great
doorway
of
the
bordj
she
turned
in
the
palanquin
and
looked
down
upon
the
desert
motioning
to
the
to
leave
the
beast
for
a
moment
she
put
her
arm
through
androvsky
s
and
made
his
eyes
follow
hers
across
the
vast
spaces
made
magical
by
the
sinking
sun
to
that
darkness
of
distant
palms
which
to
her
would
be
a
sacred
place
for
ever
and
as
they
looked
in
silence
all
that
meant
to
her
came
upon
her
she
saw
again
the
garden
hushed
in
the
heat
of
noon
she
saw
androvsky
at
her
feet
on
the
sand
she
heard
the
chiming
church
bell
and
the
twitter
of
larbi
s
flute
the
dark
blue
of
trees
was
as
the
heart
of
the
world
to
her
and
as
the
heart
of
life
it
had
seen
the
birth
of
her
soul
and
given
to
her
another
newborn
soul
there
was
a
pathos
in
seeing
it
fade
like
a
thing
sinking
down
till
it
became
one
with
the
immeasurable
sands
and
at
that
moment
she
said
to
herself
when
shall
i
see
again
and
how
she
looked
at
androvsky
met
his
eyes
and
thought
when
i
see
it
again
how
different
i
shall
be
how
i
shall
be
changed
and
in
the
sunset
she
seemed
to
be
saying
a
mute
to
one
who
was
fading
with
as
soon
as
they
had
got
off
the
camel
and
were
standing
in
the
group
of
staring
arabs
batouch
begged
them
to
come
to
their
tents
where
tea
would
be
ready
he
led
them
round
the
angle
of
the
wall
towards
the
west
and
there
pitched
in
the
full
radiance
of
the
sunset
with
a
wide
space
of
hard
earth
gleaming
with
gypse
around
it
was
a
white
tent
before
it
in
the
open
air
was
stretched
a
handsome
arab
carpet
and
on
this
carpet
were
set
a
folding
table
and
two
folding
chairs
the
table
held
a
japanned
tray
with
a
milk
jug
and
plates
of
biscuits
and
by
it
in
an
attitude
that
looked
deliberately
picturesque
stood
ouardi
the
youth
selected
by
batouch
to
fill
the
office
of
butler
in
the
desert
ouardi
smiled
a
broad
welcome
as
they
approached
and
having
made
sure
that
his
pose
had
been
admired
retired
to
the
cook
s
abode
to
fetch
the
teapot
while
batouch
invited
domini
and
androvsky
to
inspect
the
tent
prepared
for
them
domini
assented
with
a
word
she
still
felt
in
a
dream
but
androvsky
after
casting
towards
the
tent
door
a
glance
that
was
full
of
a
sort
of
fierce
shyness
moved
away
a
few
steps
and
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
hill
looking
down
upon
the
incoming
caravan
whose
music
was
now
plainly
audible
in
the
stillness
of
the
waste
domini
went
into
the
tent
that
was
to
be
their
home
for
many
weeks
alone
and
she
was
glad
just
then
that
she
was
alone
for
she
too
like
androvsky
felt
a
sort
of
exquisite
trouble
moving
like
a
wave
in
her
heart
on
some
pretext
but
only
after
an
expression
of
admiration
she
got
rid
of
batouch
then
she
stood
and
looked
round
from
the
big
tent
opened
a
smaller
one
which
was
to
serve
androvsky
as
a
and
both
of
them
as
a
baggage
room
she
did
not
go
into
that
but
saw
with
one
glance
of
soft
inquiry
the
two
small
low
beds
the
strips
of
gay
carpet
the
the
stand
and
the
two
cane
chairs
which
furnished
the
then
she
looked
back
to
the
aperture
in
the
distance
standing
alone
at
the
edge
of
the
hill
she
saw
androvsky
bathed
in
the
sunset
looking
out
over
the
hidden
desert
from
which
rose
the
wild
sound
of
african
music
steadily
growing
louder
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
he
must
be
gazing
at
the
plains
of
heaven
so
magically
brilliant
and
tender
so
pellucidly
clear
and
delicate
was
the
atmosphere
and
the
colour
of
the
sky
she
saw
no
other
form
only
his
in
this
poem
of
light
in
this
wide
world
of
the
sinking
sun
and
the
music
seemed
to
be
about
his
feet
to
rise
from
the
sand
and
throb
in
its
breast
at
that
moment
the
figure
of
liberty
which
she
had
seen
in
the
shadows
of
the
came
in
at
the
tent
door
and
laid
for
the
first
time
her
lips
on
domini
s
that
kiss
was
surely
the
consecration
of
the
life
of
the
sands
but
there
had
been
another
consecration
domini
had
a
sudden
impulse
to
link
the
two
consecrations
together
she
drew
from
her
breast
the
wooden
crucifix
androvsky
had
thrown
into
the
stream
at
and
softly
going
to
one
of
the
beds
she
pinned
the
crucifix
above
it
on
the
canvas
of
the
tent
then
she
turned
and
went
out
into
the
glory
of
the
sunset
to
meet
the
fierce
music
that
was
rising
from
the
desert
chapter
xviii
night
had
fallen
over
the
desert
a
clear
purple
night
starry
but
without
a
moon
around
the
bordj
and
before
a
cafe
maure
built
of
brown
earth
and
opposite
to
it
the
arabs
who
were
halting
to
sleep
at
arba
on
their
journeys
to
and
from
were
huddled
sipping
coffee
playing
dominoes
by
the
faint
light
of
an
oil
lamp
smoking
cigarettes
and
long
pipes
of
keef
within
the
court
of
the
bordj
the
mules
were
feeding
tranquilly
in
rows
the
camels
roamed
the
plain
among
the
tamarisk
bushes
watched
over
by
shrouded
shadowy
guardians
sleepless
as
they
were
the
mountains
the
palms
of
were
lost
in
the
darkness
that
lay
over
the
desert
on
the
low
hill
at
some
distance
beyond
the
white
tent
of
domini
and
androvsky
the
obscurity
was
lit
up
fiercely
by
the
blaze
of
a
huge
fire
of
brushwood
the
flames
of
which
towered
up
towards
the
stars
flickering
this
way
and
that
as
the
breeze
took
them
and
casting
a
wild
illumination
upon
the
wild
faces
of
the
rejoicing
desert
men
who
were
gathered
about
it
telling
stories
of
the
wastes
singing
songs
that
were
melancholy
and
remote
to
western
ears
even
though
they
hymned
past
victories
over
the
infidels
or
passionate
ecstasies
of
love
in
the
golden
regions
of
the
sun
the
steam
from
bowls
of
and
stews
of
mutton
and
vegetables
curled
up
to
join
the
thin
smoke
that
made
a
light
curtain
about
this
fantasia
and
from
time
to
time
with
a
shrill
cry
of
exultation
a
form
all
gleaming
eyes
and
teeth
and
polished
limbs
rushed
out
of
the
blackness
beyond
the
fire
leaped
through
the
tongues
of
flame
and
vanished
like
a
spectre
into
the
embrace
of
the
night
all
the
members
of
the
caravan
presided
over
by
batouch
in
glory
were
celebrating
the
wedding
night
of
their
master
and
mistress
domini
and
androvsky
had
already
visited
them
by
their
bonfire
had
received
their
compliments
watched
the
sword
dance
and
the
dance
of
the
clubs
touched
with
their
lips
or
pretended
to
touch
the
stem
of
a
keef
listened
to
a
marriage
song
warbled
by
ali
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
flute
and
little
drums
and
applauded
ouardi
s
agility
in
leaping
through
the
flames
then
with
many
pressures
of
the
hand
and
auguries
for
the
morrow
they
had
gone
away
into
the
cool
darkness
silently
towards
their
tent
they
walked
slowly
a
little
apart
from
each
other
domini
looked
up
at
the
stars
and
saw
among
them
the
star
of
liberty
androvsky
looked
at
her
and
saw
all
the
stars
in
her
face
when
they
reached
the
tent
door
they
stopped
on
the
warm
earth
a
lamp
was
lit
within
casting
a
soft
light
on
the
simple
furniture
and
on
the
whiteness
of
the
two
beds
above
one
of
which
domini
imagined
though
from
without
she
could
not
see
the
wooden
crucifix
androvsky
had
once
worn
in
his
breast
shall
we
stay
here
a
little
domini
said
in
a
low
voice
out
here
there
was
a
long
pause
then
androvsky
answered
yes
let
us
feel
it
all
all
let
us
feel
it
to
the
he
caught
hold
of
her
hand
with
a
sort
of
tender
roughness
and
twined
his
fingers
between
hers
pressing
his
palm
against
hers
don
t
let
us
miss
anything
he
said
all
my
life
is
i
ve
had
no
life
yet
who
knows
whether
we
shall
be
dead
who
knows
but
we
re
alive
flesh
and
blood
heart
and
soul
and
there
s
nothing
here
there
can
be
nothing
here
to
take
our
life
from
us
the
life
of
our
love
for
we
re
out
in
the
desert
we
re
right
away
from
anyone
everything
we
re
in
the
great
freedom
aren
t
we
domini
aren
t
we
yes
she
said
he
took
her
other
hand
in
the
same
way
he
was
facing
her
and
he
held
his
hands
against
his
heart
with
hers
in
them
then
pressed
her
hands
against
her
heart
then
drew
them
back
again
to
his
then
let
us
realise
it
let
us
forget
our
prison
let
us
forget
everything
everything
that
we
ever
knew
before
domini
it
s
dead
absolutely
dead
unless
we
make
it
live
by
thinking
and
that
s
mad
crazy
thought
s
the
great
madness
domini
have
you
forgotten
everything
before
we
knew
each
other
yes
she
said
now
but
only
now
you
ve
made
me
forget
it
there
was
a
deep
breathing
under
her
voice
he
held
up
her
hands
to
his
shoulders
and
looked
closely
into
her
eyes
as
if
he
were
trying
to
send
all
himself
into
her
through
those
doors
of
the
soul
opened
to
seeing
him
and
now
in
this
moment
she
felt
that
her
fierce
desire
was
realised
that
he
was
rising
above
her
on
eagle
s
wings
and
as
on
the
night
before
the
wedding
she
had
blessed
all
the
sorrows
of
her
life
now
she
blessed
silently
all
the
long
silence
of
androvsky
all
his
strange
reticence
his
uncouthness
his
avoidance
of
her
in
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
that
which
had
made
her
pain
by
being
now
made
her
joy
by
having
been
and
being
no
more
the
hidden
man
was
rushing
forth
to
her
at
last
in
his
love
she
seemed
to
hear
in
the
night
the
crash
of
a
great
obstacle
and
the
voice
of
the
flood
of
waters
that
had
broken
it
down
at
length
and
were
escaping
into
liberty
his
silence
of
the
past
now
made
his
speech
intensely
beautiful
and
wonderful
to
her
she
wanted
to
hear
the
waters
more
intensely
more
intensely
speak
to
me
she
said
you
ve
spoken
so
little
do
you
know
how
little
tell
me
all
you
are
till
now
i
ve
only
felt
all
you
are
and
that
s
so
much
but
not
enough
for
a
woman
not
enough
i
ve
taken
you
but
now
give
me
all
i
ve
taken
give
keep
on
giving
and
giving
from
to
receive
will
be
my
life
long
ago
i
ve
given
all
i
had
to
you
give
to
me
give
me
everything
you
know
i
ve
given
all
he
said
and
there
was
a
throb
in
his
deep
voice
as
if
some
intense
feeling
rose
from
the
depths
of
him
and
shook
it
yes
all
she
whispered
already
and
long
ago
that
day
in
the
garden
when
i
when
i
put
my
hands
against
your
forehead
do
you
remember
i
gave
you
all
for
and
as
she
spoke
she
bent
down
her
face
with
a
sort
of
proud
submission
and
put
her
forehead
against
his
heart
the
purity
in
her
voice
and
in
her
quiet
simple
action
dazzled
him
like
a
flame
shining
suddenly
in
his
eyes
out
of
blackness
and
he
too
in
that
moment
saw
far
up
above
him
the
beating
of
an
eagle
s
wings
to
each
one
the
other
seemed
to
be
on
high
and
as
both
looked
up
that
was
their
true
marriage
i
felt
it
he
said
touching
her
hair
with
his
lips
i
felt
it
in
your
hands
when
you
touched
me
that
day
it
was
as
if
you
were
giving
me
the
world
and
the
stars
it
frightened
me
to
receive
so
much
i
felt
as
if
i
had
no
place
to
put
my
gift
did
your
heart
seem
so
small
she
said
you
make
everything
i
have
and
am
seem
small
and
yet
great
what
does
it
mean
that
you
are
great
as
i
am
because
we
love
no
one
is
small
who
loves
no
one
is
poor
no
one
is
bad
who
loves
love
burns
up
evil
it
s
the
angel
that
her
words
seemed
to
send
through
his
whole
body
a
quivering
joy
he
took
her
face
between
his
hands
and
lifted
it
from
his
heart
is
that
true
is
that
true
he
said
i
ve
i
ve
tried
to
think
that
if
you
know
how
i
ve
and
don
t
you
know
it
is
true
i
don
t
feel
as
if
i
knew
anything
that
you
do
not
tell
me
i
don
t
feel
as
if
i
have
or
am
anything
but
what
you
give
me
make
me
can
you
understand
that
can
you
understand
what
you
are
to
me
that
you
are
everything
that
i
have
nothing
else
that
i
have
never
had
anything
else
in
all
these
years
that
i
have
lived
and
that
i
have
forgotten
can
you
understand
it
you
said
just
now
speak
to
me
tell
me
all
you
that
s
what
i
am
all
i
am
a
man
you
have
made
a
man
you
domini
you
have
made
me
a
man
you
have
created
she
was
silent
the
intensity
with
which
he
spoke
the
intensity
of
his
eyes
while
he
was
speaking
made
her
hear
those
rushing
waters
as
if
she
were
being
swept
away
by
them
and
you
he
said
you
i
this
afternoon
in
the
desert
when
we
were
in
the
sand
looking
at
you
began
to
tell
me
something
and
then
you
stopped
and
you
said
i
can
t
tell
you
there
s
too
much
now
the
sun
has
yes
but
but
i
want
to
listen
to
you
i
want
she
stopped
in
the
distance
by
the
great
fire
where
the
arabs
were
assembled
there
rose
a
sound
of
music
which
arrested
her
attention
ali
was
singing
holding
in
his
hand
a
brand
from
the
fire
like
a
torch
she
had
heard
him
sing
before
and
had
loved
the
timbre
of
his
voice
but
only
now
did
she
realise
when
she
had
first
heard
him
and
who
he
was
it
was
he
who
hidden
from
her
had
sung
the
song
of
the
freed
negroes
of
touggourt
in
the
gardens
of
count
anteoni
that
day
when
she
had
been
angry
with
androvsky
and
had
afterwards
been
reconciled
with
him
and
she
knew
now
it
was
he
because
once
more
hidden
from
her
for
against
the
curtain
of
darkness
she
only
saw
the
flame
from
the
torch
he
held
and
moved
rhythmically
to
the
burden
of
his
song
he
was
singing
it
again
androvsky
when
she
ceased
to
speak
suddenly
put
his
arms
round
her
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
her
escaping
from
him
in
her
silence
and
they
stood
thus
at
the
tent
door
listening
the
gazelle
dies
in
the
water
the
fish
dies
in
the
air
and
i
die
in
the
dunes
of
the
desert
sand
for
my
love
that
is
deep
and
the
chorus
of
hidden
men
by
the
fire
rose
in
a
low
murmur
that
was
like
the
whisper
of
the
desert
in
the
night
then
the
contralto
voice
of
ali
came
to
domini
and
androvsky
again
but
very
faintly
from
the
distance
where
the
flaming
torch
was
moving
no
one
but
god
and
i
knows
what
is
in
my
when
the
voice
died
away
for
a
moment
domini
whispered
the
refrain
then
she
said
but
is
it
true
can
it
be
true
for
us
androvsky
did
not
reply
i
don
t
think
it
is
true
she
added
you
know
don
t
you
the
voice
of
ali
rose
again
and
his
torch
flickered
on
the
soft
wind
of
the
night
its
movement
was
slow
and
eerie
it
seemed
like
his
voice
made
visible
a
voice
of
flame
in
the
blackness
of
the
world
they
watched
it
presently
she
said
once
more
you
know
what
is
in
my
heart
don
t
you
do
i
he
said
all
all
my
heart
is
full
of
one
thing
quite
then
i
and
she
hesitated
then
added
and
yours
mine
i
know
all
that
is
in
it
then
she
still
spoke
questioningly
he
did
not
reply
but
held
her
more
closely
with
a
grasp
that
was
feverish
in
its
intensity
do
you
remember
she
went
on
in
the
garden
what
you
said
about
that
song
you
have
forgotten
i
told
you
he
said
i
mean
to
forget
everything
before
we
came
to
and
more
everything
before
you
put
your
hands
against
my
forehead
domini
your
touch
blotted
out
the
even
the
past
at
yes
even
that
there
are
many
things
i
did
and
left
undone
many
things
i
said
and
never
said
that
i
have
forgotten
i
have
forgotten
for
there
was
a
sternness
in
his
voice
now
a
fiery
intention
i
understand
she
said
i
have
forgotten
them
too
but
not
some
which
not
that
night
when
you
took
me
out
of
the
not
our
ride
to
not
there
are
things
i
shall
remember
when
i
am
dying
after
i
am
dead
i
shall
remember
the
song
faded
away
the
torch
was
still
then
fell
downwards
and
became
one
with
the
fire
then
androvsky
drew
domini
down
beside
him
on
to
the
warm
earth
before
the
tent
door
and
held
her
hand
in
his
against
the
earth
feel
it
he
said
it
s
our
home
it
s
our
liberty
does
it
feel
alive
to
you
as
if
it
had
pulses
like
the
pulses
in
our
hearts
and
knew
what
we
know
yes
mother
earth
i
never
understood
what
that
meant
till
we
are
beginning
to
understand
together
who
can
understand
anything
alone
he
kept
her
hand
always
in
his
pressed
against
the
desert
as
against
a
heart
they
both
thought
of
it
as
a
heart
that
was
full
of
love
and
protection
for
them
of
understanding
of
them
going
back
to
their
words
before
the
song
of
ali
he
said
love
burns
up
evil
then
love
can
never
be
not
the
act
of
or
what
it
leads
to
he
said
and
again
there
was
a
sort
of
sternness
in
his
voice
as
if
he
were
insisting
on
something
were
bent
on
conquering
some
reluctance
or
some
voice
contradicting
i
know
that
you
are
right
he
added
she
did
not
speak
but
why
she
did
not
know
her
thought
went
to
the
wooden
crucifix
fastened
in
the
canvas
of
the
tent
close
by
and
for
a
moment
she
felt
a
faint
creeping
sadness
in
her
but
he
pressed
her
hand
more
closely
and
she
was
conscious
only
of
these
two
warmths
his
hand
above
her
hand
and
of
the
desert
beneath
it
her
whole
life
seemed
set
in
a
glory
of
fire
in
a
heat
that
was
that
dominated
her
and
evoked
at
the
same
time
all
of
power
that
was
in
her
causing
her
dormant
fires
physical
and
spiritual
to
blaze
up
as
if
they
were
sheltered
and
fanned
the
thought
of
the
crucifix
faded
it
was
as
if
the
fire
destroyed
it
and
it
became
ashes
then
nothing
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
distant
fire
of
the
arabs
which
was
beginning
to
die
down
slowly
as
the
night
grew
deeper
i
have
doubted
many
things
he
said
i
ve
been
you
she
said
yes
you
know
how
can
i
haven
t
i
forgotten
everything
since
that
day
in
the
garden
he
drew
up
her
hand
and
put
it
against
his
heart
i
m
jealous
of
the
desert
even
he
whispered
i
won
t
let
you
touch
it
any
more
he
looked
into
her
eyes
and
saw
that
she
was
looking
at
the
distant
fire
steadily
with
an
intense
eagerness
why
do
you
do
that
he
said
i
like
to
look
at
fire
she
answered
tell
me
it
is
as
if
i
looked
at
you
at
all
that
there
is
in
you
that
you
have
never
said
never
been
able
to
say
to
me
all
that
you
never
can
say
to
me
but
that
i
know
all
the
but
he
said
that
fire
is
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
but
put
up
his
hand
and
turned
her
face
till
she
was
looking
not
at
the
fire
but
at
him
it
is
not
like
me
he
said
men
made
it
and
it
s
a
fire
that
can
sink
into
an
expression
of
sudden
exaltation
shone
in
her
eyes
and
god
made
you
she
said
and
put
into
you
the
spark
that
is
and
now
again
she
thought
she
dared
she
loved
to
think
of
the
crucifix
and
of
the
moment
when
he
would
see
it
in
the
tent
and
god
made
you
love
me
she
said
what
is
it
androvsky
had
moved
suddenly
as
if
he
were
going
to
get
up
from
the
warm
ground
did
you
no
he
said
in
a
low
voice
go
on
domini
speak
to
he
sat
still
a
sudden
longing
came
to
her
to
know
if
he
were
feeling
as
she
was
the
sacredness
of
their
relation
to
each
other
never
had
they
spoken
intimately
of
religion
or
of
the
mysteries
that
lie
beyond
and
around
human
life
once
or
twice
when
she
had
been
about
to
open
her
heart
to
him
to
let
him
understand
her
deep
sense
of
the
things
unseen
something
had
checked
her
something
in
him
it
was
as
if
he
had
divined
her
intention
and
had
subtly
turned
her
from
it
without
speech
merely
by
the
force
of
his
inward
determination
that
she
should
not
break
through
his
reserve
but
with
his
hand
on
hers
and
the
starry
darkness
above
them
with
the
waste
stretching
around
them
and
the
cool
air
that
was
like
the
breath
of
liberty
upon
their
faces
she
was
unconscious
of
any
secret
combative
force
in
him
it
was
impossible
to
her
to
think
there
could
have
been
any
combat
however
inward
however
subtle
between
them
surely
if
it
were
ever
permitted
to
two
natures
to
be
in
perfect
accord
theirs
were
in
perfect
accord
i
never
felt
the
presence
of
god
in
his
world
so
keenly
as
i
feel
it
she
went
on
drawing
a
little
closer
to
him
even
in
the
church
he
seemed
farther
away
than
tonight
but
somehow
one
has
these
thoughts
without
knowing
why
i
have
always
believed
that
the
farther
i
went
into
the
desert
the
nearer
i
should
come
to
androvsky
moved
again
the
clasp
of
his
hand
on
hers
loosened
but
he
did
not
take
his
hand
away
why
should
what
should
make
you
think
that
he
asked
slowly
don
t
you
know
what
the
arabs
call
the
desert
no
what
do
they
call
it
the
garden
of
the
garden
of
allah
he
repeated
there
was
a
sound
like
fear
in
his
voice
even
her
great
joy
did
not
prevent
her
from
noticing
it
and
she
remembered
with
a
thrill
of
pain
where
and
under
what
circumstances
she
had
first
heard
the
arab
s
name
for
the
desert
could
it
be
that
this
man
she
loved
was
secretly
afraid
of
something
in
the
desert
some
influence
some
her
thought
stopped
short
like
a
thing
confused
don
t
you
think
it
a
very
beautiful
name
she
asked
with
an
almost
fierce
longing
to
be
reassured
to
be
made
to
know
that
he
like
her
loved
the
thought
that
god
was
specially
near
to
those
who
travelled
in
this
land
of
solitude
is
it
beautiful
to
me
it
is
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
in
the
desert
i
were
specially
watched
over
and
protected
even
as
if
i
were
specially
loved
suddenly
androvsky
put
his
arm
round
her
and
strained
her
to
him
by
me
by
me
he
said
think
of
me
only
of
me
as
i
think
only
of
he
spoke
as
if
he
were
jealous
even
of
her
thought
of
god
as
if
he
did
not
understand
that
it
was
the
very
intensity
of
her
love
for
him
that
made
her
even
in
the
midst
of
the
passion
of
the
body
connect
their
love
of
each
other
with
god
s
love
of
them
in
her
heart
this
overpowering
human
love
which
in
the
garden
when
first
she
realised
it
fully
had
seemed
to
leave
no
room
in
her
for
love
of
god
now
in
the
moment
when
it
was
close
to
absolute
satisfaction
seemed
almost
to
be
one
with
her
love
of
god
perhaps
no
man
could
understand
how
in
a
good
woman
the
two
streams
of
the
human
love
which
implies
the
intense
desire
of
the
flesh
and
the
mystical
love
which
is
absolutely
purged
of
that
desire
can
flow
the
one
into
the
other
and
mingle
their
waters
she
tried
to
think
that
and
then
she
ceased
to
try
everything
was
forgotten
as
his
arms
held
her
fast
in
the
night
everything
except
this
great
force
of
human
love
which
was
like
iron
and
yet
soft
about
her
which
was
giving
and
wanting
which
was
concentrated
upon
her
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
plunging
the
universe
in
darkness
and
setting
her
in
light
there
is
nothing
for
me
but
you
he
said
crushing
her
in
his
arms
the
desert
is
your
garden
to
me
it
has
always
been
your
garden
only
that
put
here
for
you
and
for
me
because
you
love
me
but
for
me
only
because
of
the
arabs
fire
was
rapidly
dying
down
when
it
goes
out
when
it
goes
out
androvsky
whispered
it
her
ear
his
breath
stirred
the
thick
tresses
of
her
hair
let
us
watch
it
he
whispered
she
pressed
his
hand
but
did
not
reply
she
could
not
speak
any
more
at
last
the
something
wild
and
lawless
the
something
that
was
more
than
passionate
that
was
hot
and
even
savage
in
her
nature
had
risen
up
in
its
full
force
to
face
a
similar
force
in
him
which
insistently
called
it
and
which
it
answered
without
shame
it
is
dying
androvsky
said
it
is
dying
look
how
small
the
circle
of
the
flame
is
how
the
darkness
is
creeping
up
about
it
domini
do
you
see
she
pressed
his
hand
again
do
you
long
for
the
darkness
he
asked
do
you
domini
the
desert
is
sending
it
the
desert
is
sending
it
for
you
and
for
me
because
you
love
a
log
in
the
fire
charred
by
the
flames
broke
in
two
part
of
it
fell
down
into
the
heart
of
the
fire
which
sent
up
a
long
tongue
of
red
gold
flame
that
is
like
us
he
said
like
us
together
in
the
she
felt
his
body
trembling
as
if
the
vehemence
of
the
spirit
confined
within
it
shook
it
in
the
night
the
breeze
slightly
increased
making
the
flame
of
the
lamp
behind
them
in
the
tent
flicker
and
the
breeze
was
like
a
message
brought
to
them
from
the
desert
by
some
envoy
in
the
darkness
telling
them
not
to
be
afraid
of
their
wonderful
gift
of
freedom
with
each
other
but
to
take
it
with
the
great
courage
of
joy
domini
did
you
feel
that
gust
of
the
wind
it
carried
away
a
cloud
of
sparks
from
the
fire
and
brought
them
a
little
way
towards
us
did
you
see
fire
wandering
on
the
wind
through
the
night
calling
to
the
fire
that
is
in
us
wasn
t
it
beautiful
everything
is
beautiful
there
were
never
such
stars
she
looked
up
at
them
often
she
had
watched
the
stars
and
known
the
vague
longings
the
almost
terrible
aspirations
they
wake
in
their
watchers
but
to
her
also
they
looked
different
nearer
to
the
earth
she
thought
brighter
more
living
than
ever
before
like
strange
tenderness
made
visible
peopling
the
night
with
an
unconquerable
sympathy
the
vast
firmament
was
surely
intent
upon
their
happiness
again
the
breeze
came
to
them
across
the
waste
cool
and
breathing
of
the
dryness
of
the
sands
not
far
away
a
jackal
laughed
after
a
pause
it
was
answered
by
another
jackal
at
a
distance
the
voices
of
these
desert
beasts
brought
home
to
domini
with
an
intimacy
not
felt
by
her
before
the
exquisite
remoteness
of
their
situation
and
the
shrill
discordant
noise
rising
and
falling
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
and
sneering
mirth
mingled
with
bitterness
was
like
a
delicate
music
in
her
ears
hark
androvsky
whispered
the
first
jackal
laughed
once
more
was
answered
again
a
third
beast
evidently
much
farther
off
lifted
up
a
faint
voice
like
a
dismal
echo
then
there
was
silence
you
loved
that
domini
it
was
like
the
calling
of
freedom
to
you
and
to
me
we
ve
found
freedom
we
ve
found
it
let
us
feel
it
let
us
take
hold
of
it
it
is
the
only
thing
the
only
thing
but
you
can
t
know
that
as
i
do
again
she
was
conscious
that
his
intensity
surpassed
hers
and
the
consciousness
instead
of
saddening
or
vexing
made
her
thrill
with
joy
i
am
maddened
by
this
freedom
he
said
maddened
by
it
domini
i
can
t
help
i
can
t
he
laid
his
lips
upon
hers
in
a
desperate
caress
that
almost
suffocated
her
then
he
took
his
lips
away
from
her
lips
and
kissed
her
throat
holding
her
head
back
against
his
shoulder
she
shut
her
eyes
he
was
indeed
teaching
her
to
forget
even
the
memory
of
the
day
in
the
garden
when
she
heard
the
church
bell
chime
and
the
sound
of
larbi
s
flute
went
from
her
she
remembered
nothing
any
more
the
past
was
lost
or
laid
in
sleep
by
the
spell
of
sensation
her
nature
galloped
like
an
arab
horse
across
the
sands
towards
the
sun
towards
the
fire
that
sheds
warmth
afar
but
that
devours
all
that
draws
near
to
it
at
that
moment
she
connected
androvsky
with
the
tremendous
fires
eternally
blazing
in
the
sun
she
had
a
desire
that
he
should
hurt
her
in
the
passionate
intensity
of
his
love
for
her
her
nature
which
till
now
had
been
ever
ready
to
spring
into
hostility
at
an
accidental
touch
which
had
shrunk
instinctively
from
physical
contact
with
other
human
beings
melted
was
utterly
transformed
she
felt
that
she
was
now
the
opposite
of
all
that
she
had
been
more
woman
than
any
other
woman
who
had
ever
lived
what
had
been
an
almost
cold
strength
in
her
went
to
increase
the
completeness
of
this
yielding
to
one
stronger
than
herself
what
had
seemed
boyish
and
almost
hard
in
her
died
away
utterly
under
the
embrace
of
this
fierce
manhood
domini
he
spoke
whispering
while
he
kissed
her
domini
the
fire
s
gone
out
it
s
he
lifted
her
a
little
in
his
arms
still
kissing
her
domini
it
s
dark
it
s
he
lifted
her
more
she
stood
up
with
his
arms
about
her
looking
towards
where
the
fire
had
been
she
put
her
hands
against
his
face
and
softly
pressed
it
back
from
hers
but
with
a
touch
that
was
a
caress
he
yielded
to
her
at
once
look
he
said
do
you
love
the
darkness
tell
me
tell
me
that
you
love
she
let
her
hand
glide
over
his
cheek
in
answer
look
at
it
love
it
all
the
desert
is
in
it
and
our
love
in
the
desert
let
us
stay
in
the
desert
let
us
stay
in
it
for
ever
for
ever
it
is
your
garden
yours
it
has
brought
us
everything
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
again
and
again
over
his
cheek
lingeringly
then
abruptly
he
dropped
it
come
he
said
and
he
drew
her
in
through
the
tent
door
almost
violently
a
stronger
gust
of
the
night
wind
followed
them
androvsky
took
his
arms
slowly
from
domini
and
turned
to
let
down
the
flap
of
the
tent
while
he
was
doing
this
she
stood
quite
still
the
flame
of
the
lamp
flickered
throwing
its
light
now
here
now
there
uneasily
she
saw
the
crucifix
lit
up
for
an
instant
and
the
white
bed
beneath
it
the
wind
stirred
her
dark
hair
and
was
cold
about
her
neck
but
the
warmth
there
met
and
defied
it
in
that
brief
moment
while
androvsky
was
fastening
the
tent
she
seemed
to
live
through
centuries
of
intense
and
complicated
emotion
when
the
light
flickered
over
the
crucifix
she
felt
as
if
she
could
spend
her
life
in
passionate
adoration
at
its
foot
but
when
she
did
not
see
it
and
the
wind
coming
in
from
the
desert
through
the
tent
door
where
she
heard
the
movement
of
androvsky
stirred
in
her
hair
she
felt
reckless
wayward
savage
and
something
more
a
cry
rose
in
her
that
was
like
the
cry
of
a
stranger
who
yet
was
of
her
and
in
her
and
from
whom
she
would
not
part
again
the
lamp
flame
flickered
upon
the
crucifix
quickly
while
she
saw
the
crucifix
plainly
she
went
forward
to
the
bed
and
fell
on
her
knees
by
it
bending
down
her
face
upon
its
whiteness
when
androvsky
had
fastened
the
tent
door
he
turned
round
and
saw
her
kneeling
he
stood
quite
still
as
if
petrified
staring
at
her
then
as
the
flame
now
sheltered
from
the
wind
burned
steadily
he
saw
the
crucifix
he
started
as
if
someone
had
struck
him
hesitated
then
with
a
look
of
fierce
and
concentrated
resolution
on
his
face
went
swiftly
to
the
crucifix
and
pulled
it
from
the
canvas
roughly
he
held
it
in
his
hand
for
an
instant
then
moved
to
the
tent
door
and
stooped
to
unfasten
the
cords
that
held
it
to
the
pegs
evidently
with
the
intention
of
throwing
the
crucifix
out
into
the
night
but
he
did
not
unfasten
the
cords
something
some
sudden
change
of
feeling
some
secret
and
powerful
reluctance
checked
him
he
thrust
the
crucifix
into
his
pocket
then
returning
to
where
domini
was
kneeling
he
put
his
arms
round
her
and
drew
her
to
her
feet
she
did
not
resist
him
still
holding
her
in
his
arms
he
blew
out
the
lamp
chapter
xix
the
arabs
have
a
saying
in
the
desert
one
forgets
everything
one
remembers
nothing
any
to
domini
it
sometimes
seemed
the
truest
of
all
the
true
and
beautiful
sayings
of
the
east
only
three
weeks
had
passed
away
since
the
first
halt
at
arba
yet
already
her
life
at
was
faint
in
her
mind
as
the
dream
of
a
distant
past
taken
by
the
vast
solitudes
journeying
without
definite
aim
from
one
oasis
to
another
through
empty
regions
bathed
in
eternal
sunshine
camping
often
in
the
midst
of
the
sand
by
one
of
the
wells
sunk
for
the
nomads
by
the
french
engineers
strengthened
perpetually
yet
perpetually
soothed
by
airs
that
were
soft
and
cool
as
if
mingled
of
silk
and
snow
they
lived
surely
in
a
desert
dream
with
only
a
dream
behind
them
they
had
become
as
one
with
the
nomads
whose
home
is
the
moving
tent
whose
hearthstone
is
the
yellow
sand
of
the
dunes
whose
god
is
liberty
domini
loved
this
life
with
a
love
which
had
already
become
a
passion
all
that
she
had
imagined
that
the
desert
might
be
to
her
she
found
that
it
was
in
its
monotony
she
discovered
eternal
interest
of
old
she
had
thought
the
sea
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
nature
in
the
desert
she
seemed
to
possess
the
sea
with
something
added
to
it
a
calm
a
completeness
a
mystical
tenderness
a
passionate
serenity
she
thought
of
the
sea
as
a
soul
striving
to
fulfil
its
noblest
aspirations
to
be
the
splendid
thing
it
knew
how
to
dream
of
but
she
thought
of
the
desert
as
a
soul
that
need
strive
no
more
having
attained
and
she
like
the
arabs
called
it
always
in
her
heart
the
garden
of
allah
for
in
this
wonderful
calm
bright
as
the
child
s
idea
of
heaven
clear
as
a
crystal
with
a
sunbeam
caught
in
it
silent
as
a
prayer
that
will
be
answered
silently
god
seemed
to
draw
very
near
to
his
wandering
children
in
the
desert
was
the
still
small
voice
and
the
still
small
voice
was
the
lord
often
at
dawn
or
sundown
when
perhaps
in
the
distance
of
the
sands
or
near
at
hand
beneath
the
shade
of
the
palms
of
some
oasis
by
a
waterspring
she
watched
the
desert
men
in
their
patched
rags
with
their
lean
bronzed
faces
and
eagle
eyes
turned
towards
mecca
bowing
their
heads
in
prayer
to
the
soil
that
the
sun
made
hot
she
remembered
count
anteoni
s
words
i
like
to
see
men
praying
in
the
desert
and
she
understood
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
why
for
the
life
of
the
desert
was
the
most
perfect
liberty
that
could
be
found
on
earth
and
to
see
men
thus
worshipping
in
liberty
set
before
her
a
vision
of
free
will
upon
the
heights
when
she
thought
of
the
world
she
had
known
and
left
of
the
men
who
would
always
live
in
it
and
know
no
other
world
she
was
saddened
for
a
moment
could
she
ever
find
elsewhere
such
joy
as
she
had
found
in
the
simple
and
unfettered
life
of
the
wastes
could
she
ever
exchange
this
life
for
another
life
even
with
androvsky
one
day
she
spoke
to
him
of
her
intense
joy
in
the
wandering
fate
and
the
pain
that
came
to
her
whenever
she
thought
of
exchanging
it
for
a
life
of
civilisation
in
the
midst
of
fixed
groups
of
men
they
had
halted
for
the
noonday
rest
at
a
place
called
and
in
the
afternoon
were
going
to
ride
on
to
a
bordj
called
mogar
where
they
meant
to
stay
two
or
three
days
as
batouch
had
told
them
it
was
a
good
halting
place
and
near
to
haunts
of
the
gazelle
the
tents
had
already
gone
forward
and
domini
and
androvsky
were
lying
upon
a
rug
spread
on
the
sand
in
the
shadow
of
the
grey
wall
of
a
traveller
s
house
beside
a
well
behind
them
their
horses
were
tethered
to
an
iron
ring
in
the
wall
batouch
and
ali
were
in
the
court
of
the
house
talking
to
the
arab
guardian
who
dwelt
there
but
their
voices
were
not
audible
by
the
well
and
absolute
silence
reigned
the
intense
yet
light
silence
that
is
in
the
desert
at
noontide
when
the
sun
is
at
the
zenith
when
the
nomad
sleeps
under
his
tent
and
the
gardeners
in
the
oasis
cease
even
from
pretending
to
work
among
the
palms
from
before
the
well
the
ground
sank
to
a
plain
of
pale
grey
sand
which
stretched
away
to
a
village
hard
in
aspect
as
if
carved
out
of
bronze
and
all
in
one
piece
in
the
centre
of
it
rose
a
mosque
with
a
minaret
and
a
number
of
cupolas
faintly
gilded
and
shining
modestly
under
the
fierce
rays
of
the
sun
at
the
foot
of
the
village
the
ground
was
white
with
saltpetre
which
resembled
a
covering
of
snow
to
right
and
left
of
it
were
isolated
groups
of
palms
growing
in
threes
and
fours
like
trees
that
had
formed
themselves
into
cliques
and
set
careful
barriers
of
sand
between
themselves
and
their
despised
brethren
here
and
there
on
the
grey
sand
dark
patches
showed
where
nomads
had
pitched
their
tents
but
there
was
no
movement
of
human
life
no
camels
were
visible
no
guard
dogs
barked
the
noon
held
all
things
in
its
golden
grip
boris
domini
said
breaking
a
long
silence
yes
domini
he
turned
towards
her
on
the
rug
stretching
his
long
thin
body
lazily
as
if
in
supreme
physical
contentment
you
know
that
saying
of
the
arabs
about
forgetting
everything
in
the
desert
yes
domini
i
know
how
long
shall
we
stay
in
this
world
of
forgetfulness
he
lifted
himself
up
on
his
elbow
quickly
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
hers
how
long
but
do
you
wish
to
leave
it
are
you
tired
of
it
there
was
a
note
of
sharp
anxiety
in
his
voice
i
don
t
answer
such
a
question
she
said
smiling
at
him
ah
then
why
do
you
try
to
frighten
me
she
put
her
hand
in
his
how
burnt
you
are
she
said
you
are
like
an
arab
of
the
let
me
become
more
like
one
there
s
health
and
peace
perfect
he
said
nothing
he
was
looking
down
now
at
the
sand
she
laid
her
lips
on
his
warm
brown
hand
there
s
all
i
want
here
she
added
let
us
stay
but
some
day
we
must
go
back
mustn
t
we
why
can
anything
be
lifelong
even
our
honeymoon
suppose
we
choose
that
it
shall
be
can
we
choose
such
a
thing
is
anybody
allowed
to
choose
to
live
always
quite
happily
without
duties
sometimes
i
wonder
i
love
this
wandering
life
so
much
i
am
so
happy
in
it
that
i
sometimes
think
it
can
not
last
much
he
began
to
sift
the
sand
through
his
fingers
swiftly
duties
he
said
in
a
low
voice
yes
oughtn
t
we
to
do
something
presently
something
besides
being
happy
what
do
you
mean
domini
i
hardly
know
i
don
t
know
you
tell
there
was
an
urging
in
her
voice
as
if
she
wanted
almost
demanded
something
of
him
you
mean
that
a
man
must
do
some
work
in
his
life
if
he
is
to
keep
himself
a
man
he
said
not
as
if
he
were
asking
a
question
he
spoke
reluctantly
but
firmly
you
know
he
added
that
i
have
worked
hard
all
my
life
hard
like
a
yes
i
know
she
said
she
stroked
his
hand
that
was
worn
and
rough
and
spoke
eloquently
of
manual
toil
it
had
accomplished
in
the
past
i
know
before
we
were
married
that
day
when
we
sat
in
the
garden
you
told
me
your
life
and
i
told
you
mine
how
different
they
have
been
yes
he
said
he
lit
a
cigar
and
watched
the
smoke
curling
up
into
the
gold
of
the
sunlit
atmosphere
mine
in
the
midst
of
the
world
and
yours
so
far
away
from
it
i
often
imagine
that
little
place
el
krori
the
garden
your
brother
your
stephen
that
arab
servant
what
was
his
name
el
yes
el
magin
who
taught
you
to
play
cora
and
to
sing
arab
songs
and
to
eat
with
your
fingers
i
can
almost
see
father
andre
from
whom
you
learnt
to
love
the
classics
and
who
talked
to
you
of
philosophy
he
s
dead
too
isn
t
he
like
your
mother
i
don
t
know
whether
pere
andre
is
dead
i
have
lost
sight
of
him
androvsky
said
he
still
looked
steadily
at
the
rings
of
smoke
curling
up
into
the
golden
air
there
was
in
his
voice
a
sound
of
embarrassment
she
guessed
that
it
came
from
the
consciousness
of
the
pain
he
must
have
caused
the
good
priest
who
had
loved
him
when
he
ceased
from
practising
the
religion
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
even
to
her
he
never
spoke
frankly
on
religious
subjects
but
she
knew
that
he
had
been
baptised
a
catholic
and
been
educated
for
a
time
by
priests
she
knew
too
that
he
was
no
longer
a
practising
catholic
and
that
for
some
reason
he
dreaded
any
intimacy
with
priests
he
never
spoke
against
them
he
had
scarcely
ever
spoken
of
them
to
her
but
she
remembered
his
words
in
the
garden
i
do
not
care
for
she
remembered
too
his
action
in
the
tunnel
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
in
and
the
reticence
that
they
both
preserved
on
the
subject
of
religion
and
its
reason
were
the
only
causes
of
regret
in
this
desert
dream
of
hers
even
this
regret
too
often
faded
in
hope
for
in
the
desert
the
garden
of
allah
she
had
it
borne
in
upon
her
that
androvsky
would
discover
what
he
must
surely
secretly
be
seeking
the
truth
that
each
man
must
find
for
himself
truth
for
him
of
the
eventual
existence
in
which
the
mysteries
of
this
present
existence
will
be
made
plain
and
of
the
power
that
has
fashioned
all
things
and
she
was
able
to
hope
in
silence
as
women
do
for
the
men
they
love
don
t
think
i
do
not
realise
that
you
have
worked
she
went
on
after
a
pause
you
told
me
how
you
always
cultivated
the
land
yourself
even
when
you
were
still
a
boy
that
you
directed
the
spanish
labourers
in
the
vineyards
that
you
have
earned
a
long
holiday
but
should
it
last
for
ever
you
are
right
well
let
us
take
an
oasis
let
us
become
palm
gardeners
like
that
frenchman
at
and
build
ourselves
an
african
house
white
with
a
terrace
and
sell
our
dates
we
can
give
employment
to
the
arabs
we
can
choose
the
poorest
we
can
improve
their
lives
after
all
if
we
owe
a
debt
to
anyone
it
is
to
them
to
the
desert
let
us
pay
our
debt
to
the
desert
men
and
live
in
the
it
would
be
an
ideal
life
she
said
with
her
eyes
shining
on
his
and
a
possible
life
let
us
live
it
i
could
not
bear
to
leave
the
desert
where
should
we
go
where
should
we
go
she
repeated
she
was
still
looking
at
him
but
now
the
expression
of
her
eyes
had
quite
changed
they
had
become
grave
and
examined
him
seriously
with
a
sort
of
deep
inquiry
he
sat
upon
the
arab
rug
leaning
his
back
against
the
wall
of
the
traveller
s
house
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
domini
he
asked
with
a
sudden
stirring
of
something
that
was
like
uneasiness
i
i
was
wondering
what
you
would
like
what
other
life
would
suit
yes
he
said
quickly
yes
it
s
very
strange
boris
but
i
can
not
connect
you
with
anything
but
the
desert
or
see
you
anywhere
but
in
the
desert
i
can
not
even
imagine
you
among
your
vines
in
they
were
not
altogether
mine
he
corrected
still
with
a
certain
excitement
which
he
evidently
endeavoured
to
repress
i
i
had
the
right
the
duty
of
cultivating
the
well
however
it
was
you
were
always
at
work
you
were
responsible
weren
t
you
i
can
t
see
you
even
in
the
vineyards
or
the
isn
t
it
strange
she
was
always
looking
at
him
with
the
same
deep
and
wholly
unselfconscious
inquiry
and
as
to
london
paris
suddenly
she
burst
into
a
little
laugh
and
her
gravity
vanished
i
think
you
would
hate
them
she
said
and
they
they
wouldn
t
like
you
because
they
wouldn
t
understand
let
us
buy
our
oasis
he
said
abruptly
build
our
african
house
sell
our
dates
and
remain
in
the
desert
i
hear
batouch
it
must
be
time
to
ride
on
to
mogar
batouch
batouch
batouch
came
from
the
courtyard
of
the
house
wiping
the
remains
of
a
from
his
languid
lips
untie
the
horses
said
androvsky
but
monsieur
it
is
still
too
hot
to
travel
look
no
one
is
stirring
all
the
village
is
he
waved
his
enormous
hand
with
nails
towards
the
distant
town
carved
surely
out
of
one
huge
piece
of
bronze
untie
the
horses
there
are
gazelle
in
the
plain
near
mogar
didn
t
you
tell
me
yes
monsieur
but
we
ll
get
there
early
and
go
out
after
them
at
sunset
now
they
rode
away
in
the
burning
heat
of
the
noon
towards
the
southwest
across
the
vast
plains
of
grey
sand
followed
at
a
short
distance
by
batouch
and
ali
monsieur
is
mad
to
start
in
the
noon
grumbled
batouch
but
monsieur
is
not
like
madame
he
may
live
in
the
desert
till
he
is
old
and
his
hair
is
grey
as
the
sand
but
he
will
never
be
an
arab
in
his
why
he
can
not
rest
to
madame
the
desert
gives
its
calm
but
to
monsieur
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
in
front
domini
and
androvsky
had
put
their
horses
to
a
gallop
the
sand
flew
up
in
a
thin
cloud
around
them
nom
d
un
chien
said
batouch
who
in
unpoetical
moments
occasionally
indulged
in
the
expletives
of
the
french
infidels
who
were
his
country
s
rulers
what
is
there
in
the
mind
of
monsieur
which
makes
him
ride
as
if
he
fled
from
an
enemy
i
know
not
but
he
goes
like
a
hare
before
the
sloughi
brahim
answered
ali
gravely
then
they
sent
their
horses
on
in
chase
of
the
cloud
of
sand
towards
the
southwest
about
four
in
the
afternoon
they
reached
the
camp
at
mogar
as
they
rode
in
slowly
for
their
horses
were
tired
and
streaming
with
heat
after
their
long
canter
across
the
sands
both
domini
and
androvsky
were
struck
by
the
novelty
of
this
which
was
quite
unlike
anything
they
had
yet
seen
the
ground
rose
gently
but
continuously
for
a
considerable
time
before
they
saw
in
the
distance
the
pitched
tents
with
the
dark
forms
of
the
camels
and
mules
here
they
were
out
of
the
sands
and
upon
hard
sterile
soil
covered
with
small
stones
embedded
in
the
earth
beyond
the
tents
they
could
see
nothing
but
the
sky
which
was
now
covered
with
small
ribbed
grey
clouds
and
autumnal
and
a
lonely
tower
built
of
stone
which
rose
from
the
waste
at
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
tents
to
the
east
although
they
could
see
so
little
however
they
were
impressed
with
a
sensation
that
they
were
on
the
edge
of
some
vast
vision
of
some
grandiose
effect
of
nature
that
would
bring
to
them
a
new
and
astonishing
knowledge
of
the
desert
perhaps
it
was
the
sight
of
the
distant
tower
pointing
to
the
grey
clouds
that
stirred
in
them
this
almost
excited
feeling
of
expectation
it
is
like
a
domini
said
pointing
with
her
whip
but
who
could
live
in
such
a
place
far
from
any
oasis
and
what
can
it
overlook
said
androvsky
this
is
the
nearest
horizon
line
we
have
seen
since
we
came
into
the
yes
but
she
glanced
at
him
as
they
put
their
horses
into
a
gentle
canter
then
she
added
you
too
feel
that
we
are
coming
to
something
tremendous
don
t
you
her
horse
whinnied
shrilly
domini
stroked
his
neck
with
her
hand
abou
is
as
full
of
anticipation
as
we
are
she
said
androvsky
was
looking
towards
the
tower
that
was
built
for
french
soldiers
he
said
a
moment
afterwards
he
added
i
wonder
why
batouch
chose
this
place
for
us
to
camp
in
there
was
a
faint
sound
as
of
irritation
in
his
voice
perhaps
we
shall
know
in
a
minute
domini
answered
they
cantered
on
their
horses
hoofs
rang
with
a
hard
sound
on
the
stony
ground
it
s
inhospitable
here
androvsky
said
she
looked
at
him
in
surprise
i
never
knew
you
to
take
a
dislike
to
any
before
she
said
what
s
the
matter
boris
he
smiled
at
her
but
almost
immediately
his
face
was
clouded
by
the
shadow
of
a
gloom
that
seemed
to
respond
to
the
gloom
of
the
sky
and
he
fixed
his
eyes
again
upon
the
tower
i
like
a
far
horizon
he
answered
and
there
s
no
sun
i
suppose
even
in
the
desert
we
can
not
have
it
always
she
said
and
in
her
voice
too
there
was
a
touch
of
melancholy
as
if
she
had
caught
his
mood
a
minute
later
she
added
i
feel
exactly
as
if
i
were
on
a
hill
top
and
were
coming
to
a
view
of
the
almost
as
she
spoke
they
cantered
in
among
the
tents
of
the
attendants
and
reined
in
their
horses
at
the
edge
of
a
slope
that
was
almost
a
precipice
then
they
sat
still
in
their
saddles
gazing
they
had
been
living
for
weeks
in
the
midst
of
vastness
and
had
become
accustomed
to
see
stretched
out
around
them
immense
tracts
of
land
melting
away
into
far
blue
distances
but
this
view
from
mogar
made
them
catch
their
breath
and
stiffed
their
pulses
it
was
gigantic
there
was
even
something
unnatural
in
its
appearance
of
immensity
as
if
it
were
perhaps
deceptive
and
existed
in
their
vision
of
it
only
so
surely
might
look
a
plain
to
one
who
had
taken
haschish
which
enlarges
makes
monstrous
and
threateningly
terrific
domini
had
a
feeling
that
no
human
eyes
could
really
see
such
infinite
tracts
of
land
and
water
as
those
she
seemed
to
be
seeing
at
this
moment
for
there
was
water
here
in
the
midst
of
the
desert
infinite
expanses
of
sea
met
infinite
plains
of
snow
or
so
it
seemed
to
both
of
them
and
the
sea
was
grey
and
calm
as
a
winter
sea
breathing
its
plaint
along
a
winter
land
from
it
here
and
there
rose
islets
whose
low
cliffs
were
a
deep
red
like
the
red
of
sandstone
a
sad
colour
that
suggests
tragedy
islets
that
looked
desolate
and
as
if
no
life
had
ever
been
upon
them
or
could
be
back
from
the
snowy
plains
stretched
sand
dunes
of
the
palest
primrose
colour
sand
dunes
innumerable
myriads
and
myriads
of
them
rising
and
falling
rising
and
falling
till
they
were
lost
in
the
grey
distance
of
this
silent
world
in
the
foreground
at
their
horses
feet
wound
from
the
hill
summit
a
broad
track
faintly
marked
in
the
deep
sand
and
flanked
by
huge
dunes
shaped
by
the
action
of
the
winds
into
grotesque
semblances
of
monsters
leviathans
beasts
with
prodigious
humps
sphinxes
whales
this
track
was
presently
lost
in
the
blanched
plains
far
away
immeasurably
far
sea
and
snow
blended
and
faded
into
the
cloudy
grey
above
the
near
dunes
two
desert
eagles
were
slowly
wheeling
in
a
weary
flight
occasionally
sinking
towards
the
sand
then
rising
again
towards
the
clouds
and
the
track
was
strewn
with
the
bleached
bones
of
camels
that
had
perished
or
that
had
been
slaughtered
on
some
long
desert
march
to
the
left
of
them
the
solitary
tower
commanded
this
terrific
vision
of
desolation
seemed
to
watch
it
steadily
yet
furtively
with
its
tiny
loophole
eyes
we
have
come
into
winter
domini
murmured
she
looked
at
the
white
of
the
camels
bones
of
the
plains
at
the
grey
white
of
the
sky
at
the
yellow
pallor
of
the
dunes
how
wonderful
how
terrible
she
said
she
drew
her
horse
to
one
side
a
little
nearer
to
androvsky
s
does
the
russian
in
you
greet
this
land
she
asked
him
he
did
not
reply
he
seemed
to
be
held
in
thrall
by
the
sad
immensity
before
them
i
realise
here
what
it
must
be
to
die
in
the
desert
to
be
killed
by
it
by
hunger
by
thirst
in
it
she
said
presently
speaking
as
if
to
herself
and
looking
out
over
the
mirage
sea
the
mirage
snow
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
really
felt
the
terror
of
the
her
horse
drooped
its
head
till
its
nose
nearly
touched
the
earth
and
shook
itself
in
a
long
shiver
she
shivered
too
as
if
constrained
to
echo
an
animal
s
distress
things
have
died
here
androvsky
said
speaking
at
last
in
a
low
voice
and
pointing
with
his
whip
towards
the
camels
skeletons
come
domini
the
horses
are
he
cast
another
glance
at
the
tower
and
they
dismounted
by
their
tent
which
was
pitched
at
the
very
edge
of
the
steep
slope
that
sank
down
to
the
shapes
of
the
near
dunes
an
hour
later
domini
said
to
androvsky
you
won
t
go
after
gazelle
this
evening
surely
they
had
been
having
coffee
in
the
tent
and
had
just
finished
androvsky
got
up
from
his
chair
and
went
to
the
tent
door
the
grey
of
the
sky
was
pierced
by
a
gleaming
shaft
from
the
sun
do
you
mind
if
i
go
he
said
turning
towards
her
after
a
glance
to
the
desert
no
but
aren
t
you
tired
he
shook
his
head
i
couldn
t
ride
and
now
i
can
ride
i
couldn
t
shoot
and
i
m
just
beginning
go
she
said
quickly
besides
we
want
gazelle
for
dinner
batouch
says
though
i
don
t
suppose
we
should
starve
without
she
came
to
the
tent
door
and
stood
beside
him
and
he
put
his
arm
around
her
if
i
were
alone
here
boris
she
said
leaning
against
his
shoulder
i
believe
i
should
feel
horribly
sad
shall
i
stay
he
pressed
her
against
him
no
i
shall
know
you
are
coming
back
oh
how
extraordinary
it
is
to
think
we
lived
so
many
years
without
knowing
of
each
other
s
existence
that
we
lived
alone
were
you
ever
happy
he
hesitated
before
he
replied
i
sometimes
thought
i
but
do
you
think
now
you
ever
really
were
i
don
t
know
perhaps
in
a
lonely
sort
of
you
can
never
be
happy
in
that
way
now
he
said
nothing
but
after
a
moment
he
kissed
her
long
and
hard
and
as
if
he
wanted
to
draw
her
being
into
his
through
the
door
of
his
lips
he
said
releasing
her
i
shall
be
back
directly
after
yes
don
t
wait
for
the
dark
down
there
if
you
were
lost
in
the
dunes
she
pointed
to
the
distant
sand
hills
rising
and
falling
monotonously
to
the
horizon
if
you
are
not
back
in
good
time
she
said
i
shall
stand
by
the
tower
and
wave
a
brand
from
the
why
by
the
tower
the
ground
is
highest
by
the
she
watched
him
ride
away
on
a
mule
with
two
arabs
carrying
guns
they
went
towards
the
plains
of
saltpetre
that
looked
like
snow
beside
the
sea
that
was
only
a
mirage
then
she
turned
back
into
the
tent
took
up
a
volume
of
fromentin
s
and
sat
down
in
a
at
the
tent
door
she
read
a
little
but
it
was
difficult
to
read
with
the
mirage
beneath
her
perpetually
her
eyes
were
attracted
from
the
book
to
its
mystery
and
plaintive
sadness
that
was
like
the
sadness
of
something
unearthly
of
a
spirit
that
did
not
move
but
that
suffered
she
did
not
put
away
the
book
but
presently
she
laid
it
down
on
her
knees
open
and
sat
gazing
androvsky
had
disappeared
with
the
arabs
into
some
fold
of
the
sands
the
had
vanished
with
him
without
androvsky
and
the
sun
she
still
connected
them
together
and
knew
she
would
for
ever
the
melancholy
of
this
desert
scene
was
increased
for
her
till
it
became
oppressive
and
lay
upon
her
like
a
heavy
weight
she
was
not
a
woman
inclined
to
any
morbid
imaginings
indeed
all
that
was
morbid
roused
in
her
an
instinctive
disgust
but
the
sudden
greyness
of
the
weather
coming
after
weeks
of
ardent
sunshine
and
combined
with
the
fantastic
desolation
of
the
landscape
which
was
half
real
and
half
unreal
turned
her
for
the
moment
towards
a
dreariness
of
spirit
that
was
rare
in
her
she
realised
suddenly
as
she
looked
and
did
not
see
androvsky
even
as
a
black
and
moving
speck
upon
the
plain
what
the
desert
would
seem
to
her
without
him
even
in
sunshine
the
awfulness
of
the
desolation
of
it
the
horror
of
its
distances
and
realising
this
she
also
realised
the
uncertainty
of
the
human
life
in
connection
with
any
other
human
life
to
be
dependent
on
another
is
to
double
the
sum
of
the
terrors
of
uncertainty
she
had
done
that
if
the
immeasurable
sands
took
androvsky
and
never
gave
him
back
to
her
what
would
she
do
she
gazed
at
the
mirage
sea
with
its
dim
red
islands
and
at
the
sad
white
plains
along
its
edge
winter
she
would
be
plunged
in
eternal
winter
and
each
human
life
hangs
on
a
thread
all
deep
love
all
consuming
passion
holds
a
great
fear
within
the
circle
of
a
great
glory
the
fear
within
the
circle
of
her
glory
seemed
to
grow
but
she
suddenly
realised
that
she
ought
to
dominate
it
to
confine
it
as
it
were
to
its
original
and
permanent
proportions
she
got
up
came
out
upon
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
walked
along
it
slowly
towards
the
tower
outside
freed
from
the
shadow
of
the
tent
she
felt
less
oppressed
though
still
melancholy
and
even
slightly
apprehensive
as
if
some
trouble
were
coming
to
her
and
were
near
at
hand
mentally
she
had
made
the
tower
the
limit
of
her
walk
and
therefore
when
she
reached
it
she
stood
still
it
was
a
squat
square
tower
strongly
constructed
with
loopholes
in
the
four
sides
and
now
that
she
was
by
it
she
saw
built
out
at
the
back
of
it
a
low
house
with
small
shuttered
windows
and
a
narrow
courtyard
for
mules
no
doubt
androvsky
was
right
and
french
soldiers
had
once
been
here
to
work
the
optic
telegraph
she
thought
of
the
recruits
and
of
marseilles
of
notre
dame
de
la
garde
the
mother
of
god
looking
towards
africa
such
recruits
came
to
live
in
such
strange
houses
as
this
tower
lost
in
the
desert
and
now
abandoned
she
glanced
at
the
shuttered
windows
and
turned
back
towards
the
tent
but
something
in
the
situation
of
the
tower
perhaps
the
fact
that
it
was
set
on
the
highest
point
of
the
ground
attracted
her
and
she
presently
made
batouch
bring
her
out
some
rugs
and
ensconced
herself
under
its
shadow
facing
the
mirage
sea
how
long
she
sat
there
she
did
not
know
mirage
hypnotises
the
imaginative
and
suggests
to
them
dreams
strange
and
ethereal
sad
sometimes
as
itself
how
long
she
might
have
sat
there
dreaming
but
for
an
interruption
she
knew
still
less
it
was
towards
evening
however
but
before
evening
had
fallen
that
a
weary
and
party
of
three
french
soldiers
zouaves
and
an
officer
rode
slowly
up
the
sandy
track
from
the
dunes
they
were
mounted
on
mules
and
carried
their
small
baggage
with
them
on
two
led
mules
when
they
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
they
turned
to
the
right
and
came
towards
the
tower
the
officer
was
a
little
in
advance
of
his
men
he
was
a
fair
man
of
perhaps
with
blonde
moustaches
blue
eyes
with
blonde
lashes
and
hair
very
much
the
colour
of
the
sand
dunes
his
face
was
bright
red
burnt
as
a
fair
delicate
skin
burns
by
the
sun
his
eyes
although
protected
by
large
sun
spectacles
were
inflamed
the
skin
was
peeling
from
his
nose
his
hair
was
full
of
sand
and
he
rode
leaning
forward
over
his
animal
s
neck
holding
the
reins
loosely
in
his
hands
that
seemed
nerveless
from
fatigue
yet
he
looked
smart
and
despite
his
evident
exhaustion
as
if
on
parade
he
would
be
a
dashing
officer
it
was
evident
that
both
he
and
his
men
were
riding
in
from
some
tremendous
journey
the
latter
looked
scarcely
human
in
their
collapse
they
kept
on
their
mules
with
difficulty
shaking
this
way
and
that
like
sacks
with
their
unshaven
chins
wagging
loosely
up
and
down
but
as
they
saw
the
tower
they
began
to
sing
in
chorus
half
under
their
breath
and
leaning
their
broad
hands
on
the
necks
of
the
beasts
for
support
they
looked
with
a
sort
of
haggard
eagerness
in
its
direction
domini
was
roused
from
her
contemplation
of
the
mirage
and
the
daydreams
it
suggested
by
the
approach
of
this
small
cavalcade
the
officer
was
almost
upon
her
ere
she
heard
the
clatter
of
his
mule
among
the
stones
she
looked
up
startled
and
he
looked
down
even
more
surprised
apparently
to
see
a
lady
ensconced
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
his
astonishment
and
exhaustion
did
not
however
get
the
better
of
his
instinctive
good
breeding
and
sitting
straight
up
in
the
saddle
he
took
off
his
sun
helmet
and
asked
domini
s
pardon
for
disturbing
her
but
this
is
my
home
for
the
night
madame
he
added
at
the
same
time
drawing
a
key
from
the
pocket
of
his
loose
trousers
and
i
m
thankful
to
reach
it
there
have
been
several
moments
in
the
last
days
when
i
never
thought
to
see
slowly
he
swung
himself
off
his
mule
and
stood
up
catching
on
to
the
saddle
with
one
hand
he
said
pursing
his
lips
i
can
hardly
stand
excuse
me
domini
had
got
up
you
are
tired
out
she
said
looking
at
him
and
his
men
who
had
now
come
up
with
interest
pretty
well
indeed
we
have
been
three
days
lost
in
the
great
dunes
in
a
and
hit
the
track
here
just
as
we
were
preparing
for
a
well
a
great
a
great
event
said
domini
the
last
in
a
man
s
life
he
spoke
simply
even
with
a
light
touch
of
humour
that
was
almost
cynical
but
she
felt
beneath
his
words
and
manner
a
solemnity
and
a
thankfulness
that
attracted
and
moved
her
those
terrible
dunes
she
said
and
turning
she
looked
out
over
them
there
was
no
sunset
but
the
deepening
of
the
grey
into
a
dimness
that
seemed
to
have
blackness
behind
it
the
more
ghastly
hue
of
the
white
plains
of
saltpetre
and
the
fading
of
the
mirage
sea
whose
islands
now
looked
no
longer
red
but
dull
brown
specks
in
a
pale
mist
hinted
at
the
rapid
falling
of
night
my
husband
is
out
in
them
she
added
your
husband
madame
he
looked
at
her
rather
narrowly
shifted
from
one
leg
to
the
other
as
if
trying
his
strength
then
added
not
far
though
i
suppose
for
i
see
you
have
a
camp
he
has
only
gone
after
as
she
said
the
last
word
she
saw
one
of
the
soldiers
a
mere
boy
lick
his
lips
and
give
a
sort
of
tragic
wink
at
his
companions
a
sudden
thought
struck
her
don
t
think
me
impertinent
monsieur
but
what
about
provisions
in
your
tower
oh
as
to
that
madame
we
shall
do
well
enough
here
open
the
door
marelle
and
he
gave
the
key
to
a
soldier
who
wearily
dismounted
and
thrust
it
into
the
door
of
the
tower
but
after
three
days
in
the
dunes
your
provisions
must
be
exhausted
unless
you
ve
been
able
to
replenish
you
are
too
good
madame
we
shall
manage
a
and
wine
have
you
any
wine
she
glanced
again
at
the
exhausted
soldiers
covered
with
sand
and
saw
that
their
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
and
were
shining
eagerly
all
the
good
fellow
in
her
nature
rose
up
you
must
let
me
send
you
some
she
said
we
have
she
thought
of
some
bottles
of
champagne
they
had
brought
with
them
and
never
opened
in
the
desert
we
are
all
comrades
she
added
as
if
speaking
to
the
soldiers
they
looked
at
her
with
an
open
adoration
which
lit
up
their
tired
faces
madame
said
the
officer
you
are
much
too
good
but
i
accept
your
offer
as
frankly
as
you
have
made
it
a
little
wine
will
be
a
godsend
to
us
thank
you
the
soldiers
looked
as
if
they
were
going
to
cheer
i
ll
go
to
the
camp
can
not
one
of
the
men
go
for
you
madame
you
were
sitting
here
pray
do
not
let
us
disturb
but
night
is
falling
and
i
shall
have
to
go
back
in
a
while
they
had
been
speaking
the
darkness
had
rapidly
increased
she
looked
towards
the
distant
dunes
and
no
longer
saw
them
at
once
her
mind
went
to
androvsky
why
had
he
not
returned
she
thought
of
the
signal
from
the
camp
behind
their
rose
the
flames
of
a
fire
if
one
of
your
men
can
go
and
tell
batouch
batouch
to
come
to
me
here
i
shall
be
grateful
she
answered
and
i
want
him
to
bring
me
a
big
brand
from
the
fire
over
she
saw
wonder
dawning
in
the
eyes
fixed
upon
her
and
smiled
i
want
to
signal
to
my
husband
she
said
and
this
is
the
highest
point
he
will
see
it
best
if
i
stand
go
marelle
ask
for
batouch
and
be
sure
you
bring
the
brand
from
the
the
man
saluted
and
rode
off
with
alacrity
the
thought
of
wine
had
infused
a
gaiety
into
him
and
his
companions
now
monsieur
don
t
stand
on
ceremony
domini
said
to
the
officer
go
in
and
make
your
toilet
you
are
longing
to
i
i
am
longing
to
look
a
little
more
decent
now
madame
he
said
gallantly
and
gazing
at
her
with
a
sparkle
of
admiration
in
his
inflamed
eyes
you
will
let
me
return
in
a
moment
to
escort
you
to
the
thank
will
you
permit
me
my
name
is
de
and
mine
is
madame
russian
the
officer
said
the
alliance
in
the
desert
vive
la
russie
she
laughed
that
is
for
my
husband
for
i
am
vive

he
said
the
two
soldier
echoed
his
words
impulsively
lifting
up
in
the
gathering
darkness
hoarse
voices
vive

angleterre
thank
you

she
said
now
monsieur

don
t
let
me
keep
i
shall
be
back
directly
the
officer
replied
and
he
turned
and
went
into
the
tower
while
the
soldiers
rode
round
to
the
court
tugging
at
the
cords
of
the
led
mules
domini
waited
for
the
return
of
marelle
her
mood
had
changed
a
glow
of
cordial
humanity
chased
away
her
melancholy
the
hostess
that
lurks
in
every
woman
that
sense
which
goes
with
the
mother
sense
was
alive
in
her
she
was
keenly
anxious
to
play
the
good
fairy
simply
unostentatiously
to
these
exhausted
men
who
had
come
to
mogar
out
of
the
jaws
of
death
to
see
their
weary
faces
shine
under
the
influence
of
repose
and
good
cheer
but
the
tower
looked
desolate
the
camp
was
gayer
cosier
suddenly
she
resolved
to
invite
them
all
to
dine
in
the
camp
that
night
marelle
returned
with
batouch
she
saw
them
from
a
distance
coming
through
the
darkness
with
blazing
torches
in
their
hands
when
they
came
to
her
she
said
batouch
i
want
you
to
order
dinner
in
camp
for
the
a
broad
and
radiant
smile
irradiated
the
blunt
breton
features
of
marelle
and
monsieur
the
officer
will
dine
with
me
and
monsieur
give
us
all
you
can
perhaps
there
will
be
some
she
saw
him
opening
his
lips
to
say
that
the
dinner
would
be
poor
and
stopped
him
you
are
to
open
some
of
the
champagne
the
pommery
we
will
drink
to
all
safe
returns
now
give
me
the
brand
and
go
and
tell
the
as
he
took
his
torch
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
de
trevignac
came
out
from
the
tower
he
still
looked
exhausted
and
walked
with
some
difficulty
but
he
had
washed
the
sand
from
his
face
with
water
from
the
artesian
well
behind
the
tower
changed
his
uniform
brushed
the
sand
from
his
yellow
hair
and
put
on
a
smart
cap
instead
of
his
the
spectacles
were
gone
from
his
eyes
and
between
his
lips
was
a
large
havana
his
last
kept
by
him
among
the
dunes
as
a
possible
solace
in
the
dreadful
hour
of
death
monsieur
de
trevignac
i
want
you
to
dine
with
us
in
camp
only
to
dine
we
won
t
keep
you
from
your
bed
one
moment
after
the
coffee
and
the
cognac
you
must
seal
the
triple
alliance
france
russia
england
in
some
she
had
spoken
gaily
cordially
she
added
more
gravely
one
doesn
t
escape
from
death
among
the
dunes
every
day
will
you
come
she
held
out
her
hand
frankly
as
a
man
might
to
another
man
he
pressed
it
as
a
man
presses
a
woman
s
hand
when
he
is
feeling
very
soft
and
tender
madame
what
can
i
say
but
that
you
are
too
good
to
us
poor
fellows
and
that
you
will
find
it
very
difficult
to
get
rid
of
us
for
we
shall
be
so
happy
in
your
camp
that
we
shall
forget
all
about
our
that
s
settled
with
the
brand
in
her
hand
she
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
de
trevignac
followed
her
he
had
taken
the
other
brand
from
marelle
they
stood
side
by
side
overlooking
the
immense
desolation
that
was
now
almost
hidden
in
the
night
you
are
going
to
signal
to
your
husband
madame
let
me
do
it
for
you
see
i
have
the
other
brand
thank
you
but
i
will
do
in
the
light
of
the
flame
that
leaped
up
as
if
striving
to
touch
her
face
he
saw
a
light
in
her
eyes
that
he
understood
and
he
drooped
his
torch
towards
the
earth
while
she
lifted
hers
on
high
and
waved
it
in
the
blackness
he
watched
her
the
tall
strong
but
exquisitely
supple
figure
the
uplifted
arm
with
the
torch
sending
forth
a
long
tongue
of
golden
flame
the
ardent
and
unconscious
pose
that
set
before
him
a
warm
passionate
heart
calling
to
another
heart
without
shame
made
him
think
of
her
as
some
goddess
of
the
sahara
he
had
let
his
torch
droop
towards
the
earth
but
as
she
waved
hers
he
had
an
irresistible
impulse
to
join
her
in
the
action
she
made
heroic
and
superb
and
presently
he
lifted
his
torch
too
and
waved
it
beside
hers
in
the
night
she
smiled
at
him
in
the
flames
he
must
see
them
surely
she
said
from
below
in
the
distance
of
the
desert
there
rose
a
loud
cry
in
a
strong
man
s
voice
aha
she
exclaimed
she
called
out
in
return
in
a
warm
powerful
voice
the
man
s
voice
answered
nearer
she
dropped
her
brand
to
the
earth
monsieur
you
will
come
then
in
half
an
hour
madame
with
the
most
heartfelt
pleasure
but
let
me
accompany
no
i
am
quite
safe
and
bring
your
men
with
you
we
ll
make
the
best
feast
we
can
for
them
and
there
s
enough
champagne
for
then
she
went
away
quickly
eagerly
into
the
darkness
to
be
her
husband
murmured
de
trevignac
lucky
lucky
fellow
and
he
dropped
his
brand
beside
hers
on
the
ground
and
stood
watching
the
two
flames
mingle

he
said
again
aloud

chapter
xx
when
domini
reached
the
camp
she
found
it
in
a
bustle
batouch
resigned
to
the
inevitable
had
put
the
cook
upon
his
mettle
ouardi
was
already
to
be
seen
with
a
bottle
of
pommery
in
each
hand
and
was
only
prevented
from
instantly
uncorking
them
by
the
representations
of
his
mistress
and
an
elaborate
exposition
of
the
peculiar
and
evanescent
virtues
of
champagne
ali
was
humming
a
mysterious
song
about
a
lovesick
with
which
he
intended
to
make
glad
the
hearts
of
the
assembly
when
the
halting
time
was
over
and
the
was
already
set
for
three
when
androvsky
rode
in
with
the
arabs
domini
met
him
at
the
edge
of
the
hill
you
saw
my
signal
boris
yes
he
was
going
to
say
more
when
she
interrupted
him
eagerly
have
you
any
gazelle
ah
across
the
mule
of
one
of
the
arabs
she
saw
a
body
drooping
a
delicate
head
with
thin
pointed
horns
tiny
legs
with
exquisite
little
feet
that
moved
as
the
mule
moved
we
shall
want
it
take
it
quickly
to
the
cook
s
tent
androvsky
got
off
his
mule
there
s
a
light
in
the
tower
he
said
looking
at
her
and
then
dropping
his
eyes
and
i
saw
two
signals
there
were
two
brands
being
waved
we
have
comrades
in
the
comrades
he
said
his
voice
sounded
startled
men
who
have
escaped
from
a
horrible
death
in
the
arabs
quickly
she
told
him
her
story
he
listened
in
silence
when
she
had
finished
he
said
nothing
but
she
saw
him
look
at
the
laid
for
three
and
his
expression
was
dark
and
gloomy
boris
you
don
t
mind
she
said
in
surprise
surely
you
would
not
refuse
hospitality
to
these
poor
fellows
she
put
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
pressed
it
have
i
done
wrong
but
i
know
i
haven
t
wrong
how
could
you
do
that
he
seemed
to
make
an
effort
to
conquer
something
within
him
it
s
i
who
am
wrong
domini
the
truth
is
i
can
t
bear
our
happiness
to
be
intruded
upon
even
for
a
night
i
want
to
be
alone
with
you
this
life
of
ours
in
the
desert
has
made
me
desperately
selfish
i
want
to
be
alone
quite
alone
with
it
s
that
how
glad
i
am
she
laid
her
cheek
against
his
arm
then
he
said
that
other
signal
monsieur
de
trevignac
gave
androvsky
took
his
arm
from
hers
abruptly
monsieur
de
trevignac
he
said
monsieur
de
trevignac
he
stood
as
if
in
deep
and
anxious
thought
yes
the
officer
that
s
his
name
what
is
it
boris
there
was
a
sound
of
voices
approaching
the
camp
in
the
darkness
they
were
speaking
french
i
must
said
androvsky
i
must
he
made
an
uncertain
movement
as
if
to
go
towards
the
dunes
checked
it
and
went
hurriedly
into
the
as
he
disappeared
de
trevignac
came
into
the
camp
with
his
men
batouch
conducted
the
latter
with
all
ceremony
towards
the
fire
which
burned
before
the
tents
of
the
attendants
and
for
the
moment
domini
was
left
alone
with
de
trevignac
my
husband
is
coming
directly
she
said
he
was
late
in
returning
but
he
brought
gazelle
now
you
must
sit
down
at
she
led
the
way
to
the
de
trevignac
glanced
at
the
table
laid
for
three
with
an
eager
anticipation
which
he
was
far
too
natural
to
try
to
conceal
madame
he
said
if
i
disgrace
myself
if
i
eat
like
an
ogre
in
a
fairy
tale
will
you
forgive
me
i
will
not
forgive
you
if
you
don
she
spoke
gaily
made
him
sit
down
in
a
and
insisted
on
putting
a
soft
cushion
at
his
back
her
manner
was
cheerful
almost
eagerly
kind
and
full
of
a
camaraderie
rare
in
a
woman
yet
he
noticed
a
change
in
her
since
they
stood
together
waving
the
brands
by
the
tower
and
he
said
to
himself
the
husband
perhaps
he
s
not
so
pleased
at
my
appearance
i
wonder
how
long
they
ve
been
married
and
he
felt
his
curiosity
to
see
monsieur
androvsky
deepen
while
they
waited
for
him
domini
made
de
trevignac
tell
her
the
story
of
his
terrible
adventure
in
the
dunes
he
did
so
simply
like
a
soldier
without
exaggeration
when
he
had
finished
she
said
you
thought
death
was
certain
then
quite
certain
she
looked
at
him
earnestly
to
have
faced
a
death
like
that
in
utter
desolation
utter
loneliness
must
make
life
seem
very
different
yes
madame
but
i
did
not
feel
utterly
your
men
no
after
a
pause
he
added
simply
my
mother
is
a
devout
catholic
madame
i
am
her
only
child
and
she
taught
me
long
ago
that
in
any
peril
one
is
never
quite
domini
s
heart
warmed
to
him
she
loved
this
trust
in
god
so
frankly
shown
by
a
soldier
member
of
an
african
regiment
in
this
wild
land
she
loved
this
brave
reliance
on
the
unseen
in
the
midst
of
the
terror
of
the
seen
before
they
spoke
again
androvsky
crossed
the
dark
space
between
the
tents
and
came
slowly
into
the
circle
of
the
lamplight
de
trevignac
got
up
from
his
chair
and
domini
introduced
the
two
men
as
they
bowed
each
shot
a
swift
glance
at
the
other
then
androvsky
looked
down
and
two
vertical
lines
appeared
on
his
high
forehead
above
his
eyebrows
they
gave
to
his
face
a
sudden
look
of
acute
distress
de
trevignac
thanked
him
for
his
proffered
hospitality
with
the
ease
of
a
man
of
the
world
assuming
that
the
kind
invitation
to
him
and
to
his
men
came
from
the
husband
as
well
as
from
the
wife
when
he
had
finished
speaking
androvsky
without
looking
up
said
in
a
voice
that
sounded
to
domini
new
as
if
he
had
deliberately
assumed
it
i
am
glad
monsieur
we
found
gazelle
and
so
i
hope
i
hope
you
will
have
a
fairly
good
the
words
could
scarcely
have
been
more
ordinary
but
the
way
in
which
they
were
uttered
was
so
strange
sounded
indeed
so
forced
and
so
unnatural
that
both
de
trevignac
and
domini
looked
at
the
speaker
in
surprise
there
was
a
pause
then
batouch
and
ouardi
came
in
with
the
soup
come
domini
said
let
us
begin
monsieur
de
trevignac
will
you
sit
here
on
my
right
they
sat
down
the
two
men
were
opposite
to
each
other
at
the
ends
of
the
small
table
with
a
lamp
between
them
domini
faced
the
tent
door
and
could
see
in
the
distance
the
tents
of
the
attendants
lit
up
by
the
blaze
of
the
fire
and
the
forms
of
the
french
soldiers
sitting
at
their
table
close
to
it
with
the
arabs
clustering
round
them
sounds
of
loud
conversation
and
occasional
roars
of
laughter
that
was
almost
childish
in
its
frank
lack
of
all
restraint
told
her
that
one
feast
was
a
success
she
looked
at
her
companions
and
made
a
sudden
resolve
almost
fierce
that
the
other
over
which
she
was
presiding
should
be
a
success
too
but
why
was
androvsky
so
strange
with
other
men
why
did
he
seem
to
become
almost
a
different
human
being
directly
he
was
brought
into
any
close
contact
with
his
kind
was
it
shyness
had
he
a
profound
hatred
of
all
society
she
remembered
count
anteoni
s
luncheon
and
the
distress
androvsky
had
caused
her
by
his
cold
embarrassment
his
unwillingness
to
join
in
conversation
on
that
occasion
but
then
he
was
only
her
friend
now
he
was
her
husband
she
longed
for
him
to
show
himself
at
his
best
that
he
was
not
a
man
of
the
world
she
knew
had
he
not
told
her
of
his
simple
upbringing
in
el
kreir
a
remote
village
of
tunisia
by
a
mother
who
had
been
left
in
poverty
after
the
death
of
his
father
a
russian
who
had
come
to
africa
to
make
a
fortune
by
and
who
had
had
his
hopes
blasted
by
three
years
of
drought
and
by
the
visitation
of
the
dreaded
phylloxera
had
he
not
told
her
of
his
own
hard
work
on
the
rich
uplands
among
the
spanish
workmen
of
how
he
had
toiled
early
and
late
in
all
kinds
of
weather
not
for
himself
but
for
a
company
that
drew
a
fortune
from
the
land
and
gave
him
a
bare
livelihood
till
she
met
him
he
had
never
travelled
he
had
never
seen
almost
anything
of
life
a
legacy
from
a
relative
had
at
last
enabled
him
to
have
some
freedom
and
to
gratify
a
man
s
natural
taste
for
change
and
strangely
perhaps
he
had
come
first
to
the
desert
she
could
not
she
did
not
expect
him
to
show
the
sort
of
easy
cultivation
that
a
man
acquires
only
by
long
contact
with
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
and
women
but
she
knew
that
he
was
not
only
full
of
fire
and
feeling
a
man
with
a
great
temperament
but
also
that
he
was
a
man
who
had
found
time
to
study
whose
mind
was
not
empty
he
was
a
man
who
had
thought
profoundly
she
knew
this
although
even
with
her
even
in
the
great
intimacy
that
is
born
of
a
great
mutual
passion
she
knew
him
for
a
man
of
naturally
deep
reserve
who
could
not
perhaps
speak
all
his
thoughts
to
anyone
even
to
the
woman
he
loved
and
knowing
this
she
felt
a
fighting
temper
rise
up
in
her
she
resolved
to
use
her
will
upon
this
man
who
loved
her
to
force
him
to
show
his
best
side
to
the
guest
who
had
come
to
them
out
of
the
terror
of
the
dunes
she
would
be
obstinate
for
him
her
lips
went
down
a
little
at
the
corners
de
trevignac
glanced
at
her
above
his
and
then
at
androvsky
he
was
a
man
who
had
seen
much
of
society
and
who
divined
at
once
the
gulf
that
must
have
separated
the
kind
of
life
led
in
the
past
by
his
hostess
from
the
kind
of
life
led
by
his
host
such
gulfs
he
knew
are
bridged
with
difficulty
in
this
case
a
great
love
must
have
been
the
bridge
his
interest
in
these
two
people
encountered
by
him
in
the
desolation
of
the
wastes
and
when
all
his
emotions
had
been
roused
by
the
nearness
of
peril
would
have
been
deep
in
any
case
but
there
was
something
that
made
it
extraordinary
something
connected
with
androvsky
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
seen
perhaps
known
androvsky
at
some
time
in
his
life
yet
androvsky
s
face
was
not
familiar
to
him
he
could
not
yet
tell
from
what
he
drew
this
impression
but
it
was
strong
he
searched
his
memory
just
at
first
fatigue
was
heavy
upon
him
but
the
hot
soup
the
first
glass
of
wine
revived
him
when
domini
full
of
her
secret
obstinacy
began
to
talk
gaily
he
was
soon
able
easily
to
take
his
part
and
to
join
her
in
her
effort
to
include
androvsky
in
the
conversation
the
cheerful
noise
of
the
camp
came
to
them
from
without
i
m
afraid
my
men
are
lifting
up
their
voices
rather
loudly
said
de
trevignac
we
like
it
said
domini
don
t
we
boris
there
was
a
long
peal
of
laughter
from
the
distance
as
it
died
away
batouch
s
peculiar
guttural
chuckle
which
had
something
negroid
in
it
was
audible
prolonging
itself
in
a
loneliness
that
spoke
his
pertinacious
sense
of
humour
certainly
said
androvsky
still
in
the
same
strained
and
unnatural
voice
which
had
surprised
domini
when
she
introduced
the
two
men
we
are
accustomed
to
gaiety
round
the
camp
you
are
making
a
long
stay
in
the
desert
monsieur
asked
de
trevignac
i
hope
so
monsieur
it
depends
on
my
it
depends
on
madame
why
didn
t
he
say
my
wife
thought
de
trevignac
and
again
he
searched
his
memory
had
he
ever
met
this
man
if
so
where
i
should
like
to
stay
in
the
desert
for
ever
domini
said
quickly
with
a
long
look
at
her
husband
i
should
not
madame
de
trevignac
said
i
understand
the
desert
has
shown
you
its
indeed
it
but
to
us
it
has
only
shown
its
enchantment
hasn
t
it
she
spoke
to
androvsky
after
a
pause
he
replied
the
word
when
it
came
sounded
like
a
lie
for
the
first
time
since
her
marriage
domini
felt
a
cold
like
a
cold
of
ice
about
her
heart
was
it
possible
that
androvsky
had
not
shared
her
joy
in
the
desert
had
she
been
alone
in
her
happiness
for
a
moment
she
sat
like
one
stunned
by
a
blow
then
knowledge
reason
spoke
in
her
she
knew
of
androvsky
s
happiness
with
her
knew
it
absolutely
there
are
some
things
in
which
a
woman
can
not
be
deceived
when
androvsky
was
with
her
he
wanted
no
other
human
being
nothing
could
take
that
certainty
from
her
of
course
she
said
recovered
there
are
places
in
the
desert
in
which
melancholy
seems
to
brood
in
which
one
has
a
sense
of
the
terrors
of
the
wastes
mogar
i
think
is
one
of
them
perhaps
the
only
one
we
have
been
in
yet
this
evening
when
i
was
sitting
under
the
tower
even
i
and
as
she
said
even
i
she
smiled
happily
at
androvsky
knew
some
forebodings
androvsky
said
quickly
why
should
you
he
broke
off
not
of
coming
misfortune
i
hope
madame
said
de
trevignac
in
a
voice
that
was
now
irresistibly
cheerful
he
was
helping
himself
to
some
gazelle
which
sent
forth
an
appetising
odour
and
ouardi
was
proudly
pouring
out
for
him
the
first
glass
of
blithely
winking
champagne
i
hardly
know
but
everything
looked
sad
and
strange
i
began
to
think
about
the
uncertainties
of
domini
and
de
trevignac
were
sipping
their
champagne
ouardi
came
behind
androvsky
to
fill
his
glass
non
non
he
said
putting
his
hand
over
it
and
shaking
his
head
de
trevignac
started
ouardi
looked
at
domini
and
made
a
distressed
grimace
pointing
with
a
brown
finger
at
the
glass
oh
boris
you
must
drink
champagne
she
exclaimed
i
would
rather
not
he
answered
i
am
not
accustomed
to
but
to
drink
our
guest
s
health
after
his
escape
from
death
androvsky
took
his
hand
from
the
glass
and
ouardi
filled
it
with
wine
then
domini
raised
her
glass
and
drank
to
de
trevignac
androvsky
followed
her
example
but
without
geniality
and
when
he
put
his
lips
to
the
wine
he
scarcely
tasted
it
then
he
put
the
glass
down
and
told
ouardi
to
give
him
red
wine
and
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
he
drank
no
more
champagne
he
also
ate
very
little
much
less
than
usual
for
in
the
desert
they
both
had
the
appetites
of
hunters
after
thanking
them
cordially
for
drinking
his
health
de
trevignac
said
i
was
nearly
experiencing
the
certainty
of
death
but
was
it
mogar
that
turned
you
to
such
thoughts
madame
i
think
so
there
is
something
sad
even
portentous
about
she
looked
towards
the
tent
door
imagining
the
immense
desolation
that
was
hidden
in
the
darkness
outside
the
white
plains
the
mirage
sea
the
sand
dunes
like
monsters
the
bleached
bones
of
the
dead
camels
with
the
eagles
hovering
above
them
don
t
you
think
so
boris
don
t
you
think
it
looks
like
a
place
in
which
like
a
tragic
place
a
place
in
which
tragedies
ought
to
occur
it
is
not
places
that
make
tragedies
he
said
or
at
least
they
make
tragedies
far
more
seldom
than
the
people
in
he
stopped
seemed
to
make
an
effort
to
throw
off
his
taciturnity
and
suddenly
to
be
able
to
throw
it
off
at
least
partially
for
he
continued
speaking
with
greater
naturalness
and
ease
even
with
a
certain
dominating
force
if
people
would
use
their
wills
they
need
not
be
influenced
by
place
they
need
not
be
governed
by
a
thousand
things
by
memories
by
fears
by
fancies
yes
even
by
fancies
that
are
the
merest
shadows
but
out
of
which
they
make
phantoms
half
the
terrors
and
miseries
of
life
lie
only
in
the
minds
of
men
they
even
cause
the
very
tragedies
they
would
avoid
by
expecting
he
said
the
last
words
with
a
sort
of
strong
contempt
then
more
quietly
he
added
you
domini
why
should
you
feel
the
uncertainty
of
life
especially
at
mogar
you
need
not
you
can
choose
not
to
life
is
the
same
in
its
chances
here
as
everywhere
but
you
she
answered
did
you
not
feel
a
tragic
influence
when
we
arrived
here
do
you
remember
how
you
looked
at
the
tower
the
tower
he
said
with
a
quick
glance
at
de
trevignac
i
why
should
i
look
at
the
tower
i
don
t
know
but
you
did
almost
as
if
you
were
afraid
of
my
tower
said
de
trevignac
another
roar
of
laughter
reached
them
from
the
camp
fire
it
made
domini
smile
in
sympathy
but
de
trevignac
and
androvsky
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
the
one
with
a
sort
of
earnest
inquiry
the
other
with
hostility
or
what
seemed
hostility
across
the
circle
of
lamplight
that
lay
between
them
a
tower
rising
in
the
desert
emphasises
the
desolation
i
suppose
that
was
it
androvsky
said
as
the
laugh
died
down
into
batouch
s
throaty
chuckle
it
suggests
lonely
people
for
something
that
never
comes
or
something
terrible
that
comes
de
trevignac
said
as
he
spoke
the
last
words
androvsky
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
and
looked
out
towards
the
camp
as
if
he
longed
to
get
up
and
go
into
the
open
air
as
if
the
tent
roof
above
his
head
oppressed
him
trevignac
turned
to
domini
in
this
case
madame
you
were
the
lonely
watcher
and
i
was
the
something
terrible
that
she
laughed
while
she
laughed
de
trevignac
noticed
that
androvsky
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
sad
intentness
not
reproachful
or
wondering
as
an
older
person
might
look
at
a
child
playing
at
the
edge
of
some
great
gulf
into
which
a
false
step
would
precipitate
it
he
strove
to
interpret
this
strange
look
so
obviously
born
in
the
face
of
his
host
in
connection
with
himself
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
must
have
met
androvsky
and
that
androvsky
knew
it
knew
what
he
did
not
yet
know
where
it
was
and
when
it
seemed
to
him
too
that
androvsky
thought
of
him
as
the
something
terrible
that
had
come
to
this
woman
who
sat
between
them
out
of
the
desert
but
how
could
it
be
a
profound
curiosity
was
roused
in
him
and
he
mentally
cursed
his
treacherous
memory
if
it
were
treacherous
for
possibly
he
might
be
mistaken
he
had
perhaps
never
met
his
host
before
and
this
strange
manner
of
his
might
be
due
to
some
inexplicable
cause
or
perhaps
to
some
cause
explicable
and
even
commonplace
this
monsieur
androvsky
might
be
a
very
jealous
man
who
had
taken
this
woman
away
into
the
desert
to
monopolise
her
and
who
resented
even
the
chance
intrusion
of
a
stranger
de
trevignac
knew
life
and
the
strange
passions
of
men
knew
that
there
are
europeans
with
the
arab
temperament
who
secretly
long
that
their
women
should
wear
the
veil
and
live
secluded
in
the
harem
androvsky
might
be
one
of
these
when
she
had
laughed
domini
said
on
the
contrary
monsieur
you
have
turned
my
thoughts
into
a
happier
current
by
your
how
so
you
made
me
think
of
what
are
called
the
little
things
of
life
that
are
more
to
us
women
than
to
you
men
i
ah
he
said
this
food
this
wine
this
chair
with
a
cushion
this
gay
light
madame
they
are
not
little
things
i
have
to
be
grateful
for
when
i
think
of
the
dunes
they
seem
to
me
they
seem
suddenly
he
stopped
his
gay
voice
was
choked
she
saw
that
there
were
tears
in
his
blue
eyes
which
were
fixed
on
her
with
an
expression
of
ardent
gratitude
he
cleared
his
throat
monsieur
he
said
to
androvsky
you
will
not
think
me
presuming
on
an
acquaintance
formed
in
the
desert
if
i
say
that
till
the
end
of
my
life
i
and
my
men
can
only
think
of
madame
as
of
the
good
goddess
of
the
desolate
sahara
he
did
not
know
how
androvsky
would
take
this
remark
he
did
not
care
for
the
moment
in
his
impulsive
nature
there
was
room
only
for
admiration
of
the
woman
and
gratitude
for
her
frank
kindness
androvsky
said
thank
you
he
spoke
with
an
intensity
even
a
fervour
that
were
startling
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
been
together
his
voice
was
absolutely
natural
his
manner
was
absolutely
unconstrained
he
showed
himself
as
he
was
a
man
on
fire
with
love
for
the
woman
who
had
given
herself
to
him
and
who
received
a
warm
word
of
praise
of
her
as
a
gift
made
to
himself
de
trevignac
no
longer
wondered
that
domini
was
his
wife
those
three
words
and
the
way
they
were
spoken
gave
him
the
man
and
what
he
might
be
in
a
woman
s
life
domini
looked
at
her
husband
silently
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
her
heart
were
flooded
with
light
as
if
desolate
mogar
were
the
garden
of
eden
before
the
angel
came
when
they
spoke
again
it
was
on
some
indifferent
topic
but
from
that
moment
the
meal
went
more
merrily
androvsky
seemed
to
lose
his
strange
uneasiness
de
trevignac
met
him
more
than
something
of
the
gaiety
round
the
camp
fire
had
entered
into
the
tent
a
chain
of
sympathy
had
been
forged
between
these
three
people
possibly
a
touch
might
break
it
but
for
the
moment
it
seemed
strong
at
the
end
of
the
dinner
domini
got
up
we
have
no
formalities
in
the
desert
she
said
but
i
m
going
to
leave
you
together
for
a
moment
give
monsieur
de
trevignac
a
cigar
boris
coffee
is
coming
she
went
out
towards
the
camp
fire
she
wanted
to
leave
the
men
together
to
seal
their
good
fellowship
her
husband
s
change
from
taciturnity
to
cordiality
had
enchanted
her
happiness
was
dancing
within
her
she
felt
gay
as
a
child
between
the
fire
and
the
tent
she
met
ouardi
carrying
a
tray
on
it
were
a
cups
little
glasses
and
a
tall
bottle
of
a
peculiar
shape
with
a
very
thin
neck
and
bulging
sides
what
s
that
ouardi
she
asked
touching
it
with
her
finger
that
is
an
african
liqueur
madame
that
you
have
never
tasted
batouch
told
me
to
bring
it
in
honour
of
monsieur
the
officer
they
call
it
another
surprise
of
batouch
s
she
interrupted
gaily
take
it
in
monsieur
the
officer
will
think
we
have
quite
a
cellar
in
the
he
went
on
and
she
stood
for
a
few
minutes
looking
at
the
blaze
of
the
fire
and
at
the
faces
lit
up
by
it
french
and
arab
the
happy
soldiers
were
singing
a
french
song
with
a
chorus
for
the
delectation
of
the
arabs
who
swayed
to
and
fro
wagging
their
heads
and
smiling
in
an
effort
to
show
appreciation
of
the
barbarous
music
of
the
roumis
dreary
terrible
mogar
and
its
influences
were
being
defied
by
the
wanderers
halting
in
it
she
thought
of
androvsky
s
words
about
the
human
will
overcoming
the
influence
of
place
and
a
sudden
desire
came
to
her
to
go
as
far
as
the
tower
where
she
had
felt
sad
and
apprehensive
to
stand
in
its
shadow
for
an
instant
and
to
revel
in
her
happiness
she
yielded
to
the
impulse
walked
to
the
tower
and
stood
there
facing
the
darkness
which
hid
the
dunes
the
white
plains
the
phantom
sea
seeing
them
in
her
mind
and
radiantly
defying
them
then
she
began
to
return
to
the
camp
walking
lightly
as
happy
people
walk
when
she
had
gone
a
very
short
way
she
heard
someone
coming
towards
her
it
was
too
dark
to
see
who
it
was
she
could
only
hear
the
steps
among
the
stones
they
were
hasty
they
passed
her
and
stopped
behind
her
at
the
tower
she
wondered
who
it
was
and
supposed
it
must
be
one
of
the
soldiers
come
to
fetch
something
or
perhaps
tired
and
hastening
to
bed
as
she
drew
near
to
the
camp
she
saw
the
lamplight
shining
in
the
tent
where
doubtless
de
trevignac
and
androvsky
were
smoking
and
talking
in
frank
good
fellowship
it
was
like
a
bright
star
she
thought
that
gleam
of
light
that
shone
out
of
her
home
the
brightest
of
all
the
stars
of
africa
she
went
towards
it
as
she
drew
near
she
expected
to
hear
the
voices
of
the
two
men
but
she
heard
nothing
nor
did
she
see
the
blackness
of
their
forms
in
the
circle
of
the
light
perhaps
they
had
gone
out
to
join
the
soldiers
and
the
arabs
round
the
fire
she
hastened
on
came
to
the
tent
entered
it
and
was
confronted
by
her
husband
who
was
standing
back
in
an
angle
formed
by
the
canvas
in
the
shadow
alone
on
the
floor
near
him
lay
a
quantity
of
fragments
of
glass
boris
she
said
where
is
monsieur
de
trevignac
gone
replied
androvsky
in
a
loud
firm
voice
she
looked
up
at
him
his
face
was
grim
and
powerful
hard
like
the
face
of
a
fighting
man
gone
already
why
he
s
tired
out
he
told
me
to
make
his
excuses
to
but
she
saw
in
the
table
the
coffee
cups
two
of
them
were
full
of
coffee
the
third
hers
was
clean
but
he
hasn
t
drunk
his
coffee
she
said
she
was
astonished
and
showed
it
she
could
not
understand
a
man
who
had
displayed
such
warm
even
touching
appreciation
of
her
kindness
leaving
her
without
a
word
taking
the
opportunity
of
her
momentary
absence
to
disappear
to
shirk
away
for
she
put
it
like
that
to
herself
no
he
did
not
want
but
was
anything
the
matter
she
looked
down
at
the
broken
glass
and
saw
stains
upon
the
ground
among
the
fragments
what
s
this
she
said
oh
the
african
liqueur
suddenly
androvsky
put
his
arm
round
her
with
an
iron
grip
and
led
her
away
out
of
the
tent
they
crossed
the
space
to
the
in
silence
she
felt
governed
and
as
if
she
must
yield
to
his
will
but
she
also
felt
confused
even
almost
alarmed
mentally
the
was
dark
when
they
reached
it
androvsky
took
his
arm
from
her
and
she
heard
him
searching
for
the
matches
she
was
in
the
tent
door
and
could
see
that
there
was
a
light
in
the
tower
de
trevignac
must
be
there
already
no
doubt
it
was
he
who
had
passed
her
in
the
night
when
she
was
returning
to
the
camp
androvsky
struck
a
match
and
lit
a
candle
then
he
came
to
the
tent
door
and
saw
her
looking
at
the
light
in
the
tower
come
in
domini
he
said
taking
her
by
the
hand
and
speaking
gently
but
still
with
a
firmness
that
hinted
at
command
she
obeyed
and
he
quickly
let
down
the
flap
of
canvas
and
shut
out
the
night
what
is
it
boris
she
asked
she
was
standing
by
one
of
the
beds
what
has
happened
why
happened
i
don
t
understand
why
did
monsieur
de
trevignac
go
away
so
suddenly
domini
do
you
care
whether
he
is
here
or
gone
do
you
care
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
drew
her
down
beside
him
do
you
want
anyone
to
be
with
us
to
break
in
upon
our
lives
aren
t
we
happier
alone
boris
she
said
you
did
you
let
him
see
that
you
wanted
him
to
go
it
occurred
to
her
suddenly
that
androvsky
in
his
lack
of
worldly
knowledge
might
perhaps
have
shown
their
guest
that
he
secretly
resented
the
intrusion
of
a
stranger
upon
them
even
for
one
evening
and
that
de
trevignac
being
a
sensitive
man
had
been
hurt
and
had
abruptly
gone
away
her
social
sense
revolted
at
this
idea
you
didn
t
let
him
see
that
boris
she
exclaimed
after
his
escape
from
death
it
would
have
been
perhaps
my
love
for
you
might
even
make
me
that
domini
and
if
it
did
if
you
knew
why
i
was
inhuman
would
you
blame
me
for
it
would
you
hate
me
for
it
there
was
a
strong
excitement
dawning
in
him
it
recalled
to
her
the
first
night
in
the
desert
when
they
sat
together
on
the
ground
and
watched
the
waning
of
the
fire
could
you
could
you
hate
me
for
anything
domini
he
said
tell
me
could
you
his
face
was
close
to
hers
she
looked
at
him
with
her
long
steady
eyes
that
had
truth
written
in
their
dark
fire
no
she
answered
i
could
never
hate
you
not
if
not
if
i
had
done
you
harm
not
if
i
had
done
you
a
wrong
could
you
ever
do
me
a
wrong
she
asked
she
sat
looking
at
him
as
if
in
deep
thought
for
a
moment
i
could
almost
as
easily
believe
that
god
could
she
said
at
last
simply
then
you
you
have
perfect
trust
in
me
but
have
you
ever
thought
i
had
not
she
asked
there
was
wonder
in
her
voice
but
i
have
given
my
life
to
you
she
added
still
with
wonder
i
am
here
in
the
desert
with
you
what
more
can
i
give
what
more
can
i
do
he
put
his
arms
about
her
and
drew
her
head
down
on
his
shoulder
nothing
nothing
you
have
given
you
have
done
everything
too
much
too
much
i
feel
myself
below
you
i
know
myself
below
you
far
far
how
can
you
say
that
i
couldn
t
have
loved
you
if
it
were
she
spoke
with
complete
conviction
perhaps
he
said
in
a
low
voice
perhaps
women
never
realise
what
their
love
can
do
it
might
it
might
what
boris
it
might
do
what
christ
did
go
down
into
hell
to
preach
to
the
to
the
spirits
in
his
voice
had
dropped
almost
to
a
murmur
with
one
hand
on
her
cheek
he
kept
her
face
pressed
down
upon
his
shoulder
so
that
she
could
not
see
his
face
it
might
do
that
boris
she
said
almost
whispering
too
for
his
words
and
manner
filled
her
with
a
sort
of
awe
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
is
it
are
you
quite
happy
with
me
here
in
the
desert
if
you
are
i
want
you
to
tell
me
that
you
are
remember
i
shall
believe
no
other
human
being
could
ever
give
me
the
happiness
you
give
but
he
interrupted
her
no
other
human
being
ever
has
till
i
met
you
i
had
no
conception
of
the
happiness
there
is
in
the
world
for
man
and
woman
who
love
each
then
you
are
happy
don
t
i
seem
so
she
did
not
reply
she
was
searching
her
heart
for
the
answer
searching
it
with
an
almost
terrible
sincerity
he
waited
for
her
answer
sitting
quite
still
his
hand
was
always
against
her
face
after
what
seemed
to
him
an
eternity
she
said
boris
why
did
you
say
that
about
a
woman
s
love
being
able
even
to
go
down
into
hell
to
preach
to
the
spirits
in
prison
he
did
not
answer
his
hand
seemed
to
her
to
lie
more
heavily
on
her
cheek
i
i
am
not
sure
that
you
are
quite
happy
with
me
she
said
she
spoke
like
one
who
reverenced
truth
even
though
it
slew
her
there
was
a
note
of
agony
in
her
voice
hush
he
said
hush
domini
they
were
both
silent
beyond
the
canvas
of
the
tent
that
shut
out
from
them
the
camp
they
heard
a
sound
of
music
drums
were
being
beaten
the
african
pipe
was
wailing
then
the
voice
of
ali
rose
in
the
song
of
the
freed
negroes
no
one
but
god
and
i
knows
what
is
in
my
at
that
moment
domini
felt
that
the
words
were
true
horribly
true
boris
she
said
do
you
hear
hush
i
think
there
is
something
in
your
heart
that
sometimes
makes
you
sad
even
with
me
i
think
perhaps
i
partly
guess
what
it
he
took
his
hand
away
from
her
face
his
arm
from
her
shoulder
but
she
caught
hold
of
him
and
her
arm
was
strong
like
a
man
s
boris
you
are
with
me
you
are
close
to
me
but
do
you
sometimes
feel
far
away
from
god
he
did
not
answer
i
don
t
know
i
oughtn
t
to
ask
perhaps
i
don
t
ask
no
i
don
t
but
if
it
s
that
don
t
be
too
sad
it
may
all
come
right
here
in
the
desert
for
the
desert
is
the
garden
of
allah
and
boris
put
out
the
he
extinguished
the
candle
with
his
hand
you
feel
perhaps
that
you
can
t
pray
honestly
now
but
some
day
you
may
be
able
to
you
will
be
able
to
i
know
it
before
i
knew
i
loved
you
i
saw
you
praying
in
the
i
he
whispered
you
saw
me
praying
in
the
desert
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
afraid
she
pressed
him
more
closely
with
her
arms
it
was
that
night
in
the
i
seemed
to
see
a
crowd
of
people
to
whom
the
desert
had
given
gifts
and
to
you
it
had
given
the
gift
of
prayer
i
saw
you
far
out
in
the
desert
she
heard
his
hard
breathing
felt
it
against
her
cheek
if
if
it
is
that
boris
don
t
despair
it
may
come
keep
the
crucifix
i
am
sure
you
have
it
and
i
always
pray
for
they
sat
for
a
long
while
in
the
dark
but
they
did
not
speak
again
that
night
domini
did
not
sleep
and
very
early
in
the
morning
just
as
dawn
was
beginning
she
stole
out
of
the
tent
shutting
down
the
canvas
flap
behind
her
it
was
cold
outside
cold
almost
as
in
a
northern
winter
the
wind
of
the
morning
that
blew
to
her
across
the
wavelike
dunes
and
the
white
plains
seemed
impregnated
with
ice
the
sky
was
a
pallid
grey
the
camp
was
sleeping
what
had
been
a
fire
all
red
and
gold
and
leaping
beauty
was
now
a
circle
of
ashes
grey
as
the
sky
she
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
looked
towards
the
tower
as
she
did
so
from
the
house
behind
it
came
a
string
of
mules
picking
their
way
among
the
stones
over
the
hard
earth
de
trevignac
and
his
men
were
already
departing
from
mogar
they
came
towards
her
slowly
they
had
to
pass
her
to
reach
the
track
by
which
they
were
going
on
to
the
north
and
civilisation
she
stood
to
see
them
pass
when
they
were
quite
near
de
trevignac
who
was
riding
with
his
head
bent
down
on
his
chest
muffled
in
a
heavy
cloak
looked
up
and
saw
her
she
nodded
to
him
he
sat
up
and
saluted
for
a
moment
she
thought
that
he
was
going
on
without
stopping
to
speak
to
her
she
saw
that
he
hesitated
what
to
do
then
he
pulled
up
his
mule
and
prepared
to
get
off
no
don
t
monsieur
she
said
she
held
out
her
hand
she
added
he
took
her
hand
then
signed
to
his
men
to
ride
on
when
they
had
passed
saluting
her
he
let
her
hand
go
he
had
not
spoken
a
word
his
face
burned
scarlet
by
the
sun
had
a
look
of
exhaustion
on
it
but
also
another
look
of
horror
she
thought
as
if
in
his
soul
he
was
recoiling
from
her
his
inflamed
blue
eyes
watched
her
as
if
in
a
search
that
was
intense
she
stood
beside
the
mule
in
amazement
she
could
hardly
believe
that
this
was
the
man
who
had
thanked
her
with
tears
in
his
eyes
for
her
hospitality
the
night
before
he
said
speaking
at
last
coldly
she
saw
him
glance
at
the
tent
from
which
she
had
come
the
horror
in
his
face
surely
deepened
goodbye
madame
he
repeated
thank
you
for
your
he
pulled
up
the
rein
to
ride
on
the
mule
moved
a
step
or
two
then
suddenly
he
checked
it
and
turned
in
the
saddle
madame
he
said
madame
she
came
up
to
him
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
going
to
say
something
of
tremendous
importance
to
her
his
lips
blistered
by
the
sun
opened
to
speak
but
he
only
looked
again
towards
the
tent
in
which
androvsky
was
still
sleeping
then
at
her
a
long
moment
passed
then
de
trevignac
as
if
moved
by
an
irresistable
impulse
leaned
from
the
saddle
and
made
over
domini
the
sign
of
the
cross
his
hand
dropped
down
against
the
mule
s
side
and
without
another
word
or
look
he
rode
away
to
the
north
following
his
men
chapter
xxi
that
same
day
to
the
surprise
of
batouch
they
left
mogar
to
both
domini
and
androvsky
it
seemed
a
tragic
place
a
place
where
the
desert
showed
them
a
countenance
that
was
menacing
they
moved
on
towards
the
south
wandering
aimlessly
through
the
warm
regions
of
the
sun
then
as
the
spring
drew
into
summer
and
the
heat
became
daily
more
intense
they
turned
again
northwards
and
on
an
evening
in
may
pitched
their
camp
on
the
outskirts
of
the
sahara
city
of
amara
this
city
although
situated
in
the
northern
part
of
the
desert
was
called
by
the
arabs
the
belly
of
the
sahara
and
also
the
city
of
it
lay
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
region
of
soft
and
shifting
sand
that
suggested
a
white
sea
in
which
the
oasis
of
date
palms
at
the
edge
of
which
the
city
stood
was
a
green
island
from
the
south
whence
the
wanderers
came
the
desert
sloped
gently
upwards
for
a
long
distance
perhaps
half
a
day
s
march
and
many
kilometres
before
the
city
was
reached
the
minarets
of
its
mosques
were
visible
pointing
to
the
brilliant
blue
sky
that
arched
the
whiteness
of
the
sands
round
about
the
city
on
every
side
great
rose
like
ramparts
erected
by
nature
to
guard
it
from
the
assaults
of
enemies
these
hills
were
black
with
the
tents
of
desert
tribes
which
from
far
off
looked
like
multitudes
of
flies
that
had
settled
on
the
sands
the
palms
of
the
oasis
which
stretched
northwards
from
the
city
could
not
be
seen
from
the
south
till
the
city
was
reached
and
in
late
spring
this
region
was
a
strange
and
barbarous
pageant
of
blue
and
white
and
gold
crude
in
its
intensity
fierce
in
its
crudity
almost
terrible
in
its
blazing
splendour
that
was
like
the
splendour
about
the
portals
of
the
sun
domini
and
androvsky
rode
towards
amara
at
a
foot
s
pace
looking
towards
its
distant
towers
a
quivering
silence
lay
around
them
yet
already
they
seemed
to
hear
the
cries
of
the
voices
of
a
great
multitude
to
be
aware
of
the
movement
of
thronging
crowds
of
men
this
was
the
first
sahara
city
they
had
drawn
near
to
and
their
minds
were
full
of
memories
of
the
stories
of
batouch
told
to
them
by
the
camp
fire
at
night
in
the
uninhabited
places
which
till
now
had
been
their
home
stories
of
the
wealthy
date
merchants
who
trafficked
here
and
dwelt
in
oriental
palaces
poor
in
aspect
as
seen
from
the
dark
and
narrow
streets
or
zgags
in
which
they
were
situated
but
within
full
of
the
splendours
of
eastern
luxury
of
the
jew
moneylenders
who
lived
apart
in
their
own
quarter
rapacious
as
wolves
hoarding
their
gains
and
practising
the
rites
of
their
ancient
and
according
to
the
arabs
detestable
religion
of
the
marabouts
or
sacred
men
revered
by
the
mohammedans
who
rode
on
white
horses
through
the
public
ways
followed
by
adoring
fanatics
who
sought
to
touch
their
garments
and
amulets
and
demanded
importunately
miraculous
blessings
at
their
hands
the
hedgehog
s
foot
to
protect
their
women
in
the
peril
of
childbirth
the
scroll
covered
with
verses
of
the
koran
and
enclosed
in
a
sheaf
of
leather
that
banishes
ill
dreams
at
night
and
stays
the
uncertain
feet
of
the
the
camel
s
skull
that
brings
fruit
to
the
palm
trees
the
red
coral
that
stops
the
flow
of
blood
from
a
of
the
glittering
in
an
armour
of
golden
pieces
their
heads
tied
with
purple
and
red
and
yellow
handkerchiefs
of
silk
crowned
with
great
bars
of
solid
gold
and
tufted
with
ostrich
feathers
of
the
dwarfs
and
jugglers
who
by
night
perform
in
the
marketplace
contending
for
custom
with
the
sorceresses
who
tell
the
fates
from
shells
gathered
by
mirage
seas
with
the
who
are
immune
from
the
poison
of
serpents
and
the
acrobats
who
come
from
persia
and
arabia
to
spread
their
carpets
in
the
shadow
of
the
agha
s
dwelling
and
delight
the
eyes
of
negro
and
kabyle
of
soudanese
and
touareg
with
their
feats
of
strength
of
the
haschish
smokers
who
assembled
by
night
in
an
underground
house
whose
ceiling
and
walls
were
black
as
ebony
gave
themselves
up
to
of
shifting
glory
in
which
the
things
of
earth
and
the
joys
and
passions
of
men
reappeared
but
transformed
by
the
magic
influence
of
the
drug
made
monstrous
or
fairylike
intensified
or
turned
to
voluptuous
languors
through
which
the
ouled
nail
floated
like
a
syren
promising
ecstasies
unknown
even
in
baghdad
where
the
pale
circassian
lifts
her
lustrous
eyes
in
which
the
palms
were
heavy
with
dates
of
solid
gold
and
the
streams
were
gliding
silver
often
they
had
smiled
over
batouch
s
opulent
descriptions
of
the
marvels
of
which
they
suspected
to
be
very
far
away
from
the
reality
and
yet
nevertheless
when
they
saw
the
minarets
soaring
above
the
sands
to
the
brassy
heaven
it
seemed
to
them
both
as
if
perhaps
they
might
be
true
the
place
looked
intensely
barbaric
the
approach
to
it
was
grandiose
wide
as
the
sands
had
been
they
seemed
to
widen
out
into
a
greater
immensity
of
arid
pallor
before
the
city
gates
as
yet
unseen
the
stretch
of
blue
above
looked
vaster
here
the
horizons
more
remote
the
radiance
of
the
sun
more
vivid
more
inexorable
nature
surely
expanded
as
if
in
an
effort
to
hold
her
arm
against
some
tremendous
spectacle
set
in
its
bosom
by
the
activity
of
men
who
were
strong
and
ardent
as
the
giants
of
old
who
had
powers
and
a
passion
for
employing
them
persistently
not
known
in
any
other
region
of
the
earth
the
immensity
of
mogar
brought
sadness
to
the
mind
the
immensity
of
brought
excitement
even
at
this
distance
from
it
when
its
minarets
were
still
like
shadowy
fingers
of
an
unlifted
hand
androvsky
and
domini
were
conscious
of
influences
streaming
forth
from
its
battlements
over
the
sloping
sands
like
a
procession
that
welcomed
them
to
a
new
phase
of
desert
life
and
people
talk
of
the
monotony
of
the
sahara
domini
said
speaking
out
of
their
mutual
thought
everything
is
here
boris
you
ve
never
drawn
near
to
london
long
before
you
reach
the
first
suburbs
you
feel
london
like
a
great
influence
brooding
over
the
fields
and
the
woods
here
you
feel
amara
in
the
same
way
brooding
over
the
sands
it
s
as
if
the
sands
were
full
of
voices
doesn
t
it
excite
you
yes
he
said
but
and
he
turned
in
his
saddle
and
looked
back
i
feel
as
if
the
solitudes
were
we
can
return
to
we
are
splendidly
free
there
s
nothing
to
prevent
us
leaving
amara
isn
t
there
he
answered
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
minarets
what
can
there
be
who
knows
what
do
you
mean
boris
are
you
superstitious
but
you
reject
the
influence
of
place
don
t
you
remember
at
mogar
at
the
mention
of
the
name
his
face
clouded
and
she
was
sorry
she
had
spoken
it
since
they
had
left
the
hill
above
the
mirage
sea
they
had
scarcely
ever
alluded
to
their
night
there
they
had
never
once
talked
of
the
dinner
in
camp
with
de
trevignac
and
his
men
or
renewed
their
conversation
in
the
tent
on
the
subject
of
religion
but
since
that
day
since
her
words
about
androvsky
s
lack
of
perfect
happiness
even
with
her
far
out
in
the
freedom
of
the
desert
domini
had
been
conscious
that
despite
their
great
love
for
each
other
their
mutual
passion
for
the
solitude
in
which
it
grew
each
day
more
deep
and
more
engrossing
wrapping
their
lives
in
fire
and
leading
them
on
to
the
inner
abodes
of
sacred
understanding
there
was
at
moments
a
barrier
between
them
at
first
she
had
striven
not
to
recognise
its
existence
she
had
striven
to
be
blind
but
she
was
essentially
a
brave
woman
and
an
almost
fanatical
lover
of
truth
for
its
own
sake
thinking
that
what
is
called
an
ugly
truth
is
less
ugly
than
the
loveliest
lie
to
deny
truth
is
to
play
the
coward
she
could
not
long
do
that
and
so
she
quickly
learned
to
face
this
truth
with
steady
eyes
and
an
unflinching
heart
at
moments
androvsky
retreated
from
her
his
mind
became
remote
more
his
heart
was
far
from
her
and
in
its
distant
place
was
suffering
of
that
she
was
assured
but
she
was
assured
too
that
she
stood
to
him
for
perfection
in
human
companionship
a
woman
s
love
is
perhaps
the
only
true
divining
rod
domini
knew
instinctively
where
lay
the
troubled
waters
what
troubled
them
in
their
subterranean
dwelling
she
was
certain
that
androvsky
was
at
peace
with
her
but
not
with
himself
she
had
said
to
him
in
the
tent
that
she
thought
he
sometimes
felt
far
away
from
god
the
conviction
grew
in
her
that
even
the
satisfaction
of
his
great
human
love
was
not
enough
for
his
nature
he
demanded
sometimes
imperiously
not
only
the
peace
that
can
be
understood
gloriously
but
also
that
other
peace
which
passeth
understanding
and
because
he
had
it
not
he
suffered
in
the
garden
of
allah
he
felt
a
loneliness
even
though
she
was
with
him
and
he
could
not
speak
with
her
of
this
loneliness
that
was
the
barrier
between
them
she
thought
she
prayed
for
him
in
the
tent
by
night
in
the
desert
under
the
burning
sky
by
day
when
the
muezzin
cried
from
the
minaret
of
some
tiny
village
lost
in
the
desolation
of
the
wastes
turning
to
the
north
south
east
and
west
and
the
mussulmans
bowed
their
shaved
heads
facing
towards
mecca
she
prayed
to
the
catholics
god
whom
she
felt
to
be
the
god
too
of
all
the
devout
of
all
the
religions
of
the
world
and
to
the
mother
of
god
looking
towards
africa
she
prayed
that
this
man
whom
she
loved
and
who
she
believed
was
seeking
might
find
and
she
felt
that
there
was
a
strength
a
passion
in
her
prayers
which
could
not
be
rejected
she
felt
that
some
day
allah
would
show
himself
in
his
garden
to
the
wanderer
there
she
dared
to
feel
that
because
she
dared
to
believe
in
the
endless
mercy
of
god
and
when
that
moment
came
she
felt
too
that
their
love
hers
and
his
for
each
other
would
be
crowned
beautiful
and
intense
as
it
was
it
still
lacked
something
it
needed
to
be
encircled
by
the
protecting
love
of
a
god
in
whom
they
both
believed
in
the
same
way
and
to
whom
they
both
were
equally
near
while
she
felt
close
to
this
love
and
he
far
from
it
they
were
not
quite
together
there
were
moments
in
which
she
was
troubled
even
sad
but
they
passed
for
she
had
a
great
courage
a
great
confidence
the
hope
that
dwells
like
a
flame
in
the
purity
of
prayer
comforted
her
i
love
the
solitudes
he
said
i
love
to
have
you
to
if
we
lived
always
in
the
greatest
city
of
the
world
it
would
make
no
difference
she
said
quietly
you
know
that
he
bent
over
from
his
saddle
and
clasped
her
hand
in
his
and
they
rode
thus
up
the
great
slope
of
the
sands
with
their
horses
close
together
the
minarets
of
the
city
grew
more
distinct
they
dominated
the
waste
as
the
thought
of
allah
dominates
the
mohammedan
world
presently
far
away
on
the
left
domini
and
androvsky
saw
hills
of
sand
clearly
defined
like
small
mountains
delicately
shaped
on
the
summits
of
these
hills
were
arab
villages
of
the
hue
of
bronze
gleaming
in
the
sun
no
trees
stood
near
them
but
beyond
them
much
farther
off
was
the
long
green
line
of
the
palms
of
a
large
oasis
between
them
and
the
riders
moved
slowly
towards
the
minarets
dark
things
that
looked
like
serpents
writhing
through
the
sands
these
were
caravans
coming
into
the
city
from
long
journeys
here
and
there
dotted
about
in
the
immensity
were
solitary
horsemen
camels
in
twos
and
threes
small
troops
of
donkeys
and
all
the
things
that
moved
went
towards
the
minarets
as
if
irresistibly
drawn
onwards
by
some
strong
influence
that
sucked
them
in
from
the
solitudes
of
the
whirlpool
of
human
life
again
domini
thought
of
the
approach
to
london
and
of
the
dominion
of
great
cities
those
octopus
monsters
created
by
men
whose
tentacles
are
strong
to
seize
and
stronger
still
to
keep
she
was
infected
by
androvsky
s
dread
of
a
changed
life
and
through
her
excitement
that
pulsed
with
interest
and
curiosity
she
felt
a
faint
thrill
of
something
that
was
like
fear
boris
she
said
i
feel
as
if
your
thoughts
were
being
conveyed
to
me
by
your
touch
perhaps
the
solitudes
are
by
a
simultaneous
impulse
they
pulled
in
their
horses
and
listened
sounds
came
to
them
over
the
sands
thin
and
remote
they
could
not
tell
what
they
were
but
they
knew
that
they
heard
something
which
suggested
the
distant
presence
of
life
what
is
it
said
domini
i
don
t
know
but
i
hear
something
it
travels
to
us
from
the
they
both
leaned
forward
on
their
horses
necks
holding
each
other
s
hand
i
feel
the
tumult
of
men
androvsky
said
presently
and
i
but
it
seems
as
if
no
men
could
have
elected
to
build
a
city
here
in
the
belly
of
the
desert
he
said
quoting
the
arabs
name
for
amara
boris
she
spoke
in
a
more
eager
voice
clasping
his
hand
strongly
you
remember
the
in
count
anteoni
s
garden
the
place
where
it
stood
was
the
very
heart
of
the
we
understood
each
other
he
pressed
her
hand
without
speaking
amara
seems
to
me
the
heart
of
the
garden
of
allah
perhaps
perhaps
we
shall
she
paused
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
his
face
what
domini
he
asked
he
looked
expectant
but
anxious
and
watched
her
but
with
eyes
that
seemed
ready
to
look
away
from
her
at
a
word
perhaps
we
shall
understand
each
other
even
better
he
looked
down
at
the
white
sand
better
he
repeated
could
we
do
that
she
did
not
answer
the
villages
gleamed
mysteriously
on
their
little
mountains
like
unreal
things
that
might
fade
away
as
castles
fade
in
the
fire
the
sky
above
the
minarets
was
changing
in
colour
slowly
its
blue
was
being
invaded
by
a
green
that
was
a
sister
colour
a
curious
light
that
seemed
to
rise
from
below
rather
than
to
descend
from
above
was
transmuting
the
whiteness
of
the
sands
a
lemon
yellow
crept
through
them
but
they
still
looked
cold
and
strange
and
immeasurably
vast
domini
fancied
that
the
silence
of
the
desert
deepened
so
that
in
it
they
might
hear
the
voices
of
amara
more
distinctly
you
know
she
said
when
one
looks
out
over
the
desert
from
a
height
as
we
did
from
the
tower
of
it
seems
to
call
one
there
s
a
voice
in
the
blue
distance
that
seems
to
say
come
to
me
i
am
here
hidden
in
my
retreat
beyond
the
blue
and
beyond
the
mirage
and
beyond
the
farthest
verge
yes
i
i
have
always
felt
when
we
travelled
in
the
desert
that
the
calling
thing
the
soul
of
the
desert
retreated
as
i
advanced
and
still
summoned
me
onward
but
always
from
an
infinite
and
i
too
now
i
don
t
feel
that
i
feel
as
if
now
we
were
coming
near
to
the
voice
as
if
we
should
reach
it
at
amara
as
if
there
it
would
tell
us
its
imagination
he
said
but
he
spoke
seriously
almost
mystically
his
voice
was
at
odds
with
the
word
it
said
she
noticed
that
and
was
sure
that
he
was
secretly
sharing
her
sensation
she
even
suspected
that
he
had
perhaps
felt
it
first
let
us
ride
on
he
said
do
you
see
the
change
in
the
light
do
you
see
the
green
in
the
sky
it
is
cooler
too
this
is
the
wind
of
their
hands
fell
apart
and
they
rode
slowly
on
up
the
long
slope
of
the
sands
presently
they
saw
that
they
had
come
out
of
the
trackless
waste
and
that
though
still
a
long
way
from
the
city
they
were
riding
on
a
desert
road
which
had
been
trodden
by
multitudes
of
feet
there
were
many
footprints
here
on
either
side
were
low
banks
of
sand
beaten
into
a
rough
symmetry
by
implements
of
men
and
shallow
trenches
through
which
no
water
ran
in
front
of
them
they
saw
the
numerous
caravans
now
more
distinct
converging
from
left
and
right
slowly
to
this
great
isle
of
the
desert
which
stretched
in
a
straight
line
to
the
minarets
we
are
on
a
highway
domini
said
androvsky
sighed
i
feel
already
as
if
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
he
answered
our
love
for
peace
oughtn
t
to
make
us
hate
our
fellowmen
she
said
come
boris
let
us
chase
away
our
selfish
mood
she
spoke
in
a
more
cheerful
voice
and
drew
her
rein
a
little
tighter
her
horse
quickened
its
pace
and
think
how
our
stay
at
amara
will
make
us
love
the
solitudes
when
we
return
to
them
again
contrast
is
the
salt
of
you
speak
as
if
you
didn
t
believe
what
you
are
she
laughed
if
i
were
ever
inclined
to
tell
you
a
lie
she
said
i
should
not
dare
to
your
mind
penetrates
mine
too
you
could
not
tell
me
a
do
you
hear
the
dogs
barking
she
said
after
a
moment
they
are
among
those
tents
that
are
like
flies
on
the
sands
around
the
city
that
is
the
tribe
of
the
ouled
nails
i
suppose
batouch
says
they
camp
here
what
multitudes
of
tents
those
are
the
suburbs
of
amara
i
would
rather
live
in
them
than
in
the
suburbs
of
london
oh
how
far
away
we
are
as
if
we
were
at
the
end
of
the
world
either
her
last
words
or
her
previous
change
of
manner
to
a
lighter
cheerfulness
almost
a
briskness
seemed
to
rouse
androvsky
to
a
greater
confidence
even
to
anticipation
of
possible
pleasure
yes
after
all
it
is
only
the
desert
men
who
are
here
amara
is
their
metropolis
and
in
it
we
shall
only
see
their
his
horse
plunged
he
had
touched
it
sharply
with
his
heel
i
believe
you
hate
the
thought
of
civilisation
she
exclaimed
and
you
i
never
think
of
it
i
feel
almost
as
if
i
had
never
known
it
and
could
never
know
why
should
you
you
love
the
they
make
my
whole
nature
leap
even
when
i
was
a
child
it
was
so
i
remember
once
reading
in
it
i
came
upon
a
passage
i
can
t
remember
it
well
but
it
was
about
the
red
man
she
thought
for
a
moment
looking
towards
the
city
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
quite
she
murmured
when
the
red
man
laughs
by
his
cedar
tree
and
the
red
man
s
babe
leaps
beyond
the
sea
something
like
that
but
i
know
that
it
made
my
heart
beat
and
that
i
felt
as
if
i
had
wings
and
were
spreading
them
to
fly
away
to
the
most
remote
places
of
the
earth
and
now
i
have
spread
my
wings
and
it
s
glorious
come
boris
they
put
their
horses
to
a
canter
and
soon
drew
near
to
the
caravans
they
had
sent
batouch
and
ali
who
generally
accompanied
them
on
with
the
rest
of
the
camp
both
had
many
friends
in
amara
and
were
eager
to
be
there
it
was
obvious
that
they
and
all
the
attendants
servants
and
thought
of
it
as
the
provincial
frenchman
thinks
of
paris
as
a
place
of
all
worldly
wonders
and
delights
batouch
was
to
meet
them
at
the
entrance
to
the
city
and
when
they
had
seen
the
marvels
of
its
was
to
conduct
them
to
the
tents
which
would
be
pitched
on
the
outside
their
horses
pulled
as
if
they
too
longed
for
a
spell
of
city
life
after
the
life
of
the
wastes
and
domini
s
excitement
grew
she
felt
vivid
animal
spirits
boiling
up
within
her
the
sane
and
healthy
sense
that
welcomes
a
big
manifestation
of
the
ceaseless
enterprise
and
keen
activity
of
a
brotherhood
of
men
the
loaded
camels
the
running
drivers
the
dogs
sensitively
sniffing
as
if
enticing
smells
from
the
city
already
reached
their
nostrils
the
chattering
desert
merchants
discussing
coming
gains
the
wealthy
and
arabs
mounted
on
fine
horses
and
staring
with
eyes
that
glittered
up
the
broad
track
in
search
of
welcoming
friends
were
sympathetic
to
her
mood
amara
was
sucking
them
all
in
together
from
the
solitary
places
as
quiet
waters
are
sucked
into
the
turmoils
of
a
although
still
out
in
the
sands
they
were
already
in
the
midst
of
a
noise
of
life
flowing
to
meet
the
roar
of
life
that
rose
up
at
the
feet
of
the
minarets
which
now
looked
tall
and
majestic
in
the
growing
beauty
of
the
sunset
they
passed
the
caravans
one
by
one
and
came
on
to
the
crest
of
the
long
sand
slope
just
as
the
sky
above
the
city
was
flushing
with
a
bright
geranium
red
the
track
from
here
was
level
to
the
city
wall
and
was
no
longer
soft
with
sand
a
broad
hard
road
rang
beneath
their
horses
hoofs
startling
them
with
a
music
that
was
like
a
voice
of
civilised
life
before
them
under
the
red
sky
they
saw
a
dark
blue
of
distant
houses
towers
and
great
round
cupolas
glittering
like
gold
forests
of
palm
trees
lay
behind
the
giant
date
palms
for
which
amara
was
famous
to
the
left
stretched
the
sands
dotted
with
gleaming
arab
villages
to
the
right
again
the
sands
covered
with
hundreds
of
tents
among
which
quantities
of
figures
moved
lively
like
ants
black
on
the
yellow
arched
by
the
sky
that
was
alive
with
lurid
colour
red
fading
into
gold
gold
into
primrose
primrose
into
green
green
into
the
blue
that
still
told
of
the
fading
day
and
to
this
sky
from
the
barbaric
city
and
the
immense
sands
in
which
it
was
set
rose
a
great
chorus
of
life
voices
of
men
and
beasts
cries
of
naked
children
playing
cora
on
the
of
mothers
to
straying
infants
shrill
laughter
of
unveiled
girls
wantonly
gay
the
calls
of
men
the
barking
of
multitudes
of
dogs
the
guard
dogs
of
the
nomads
that
are
never
silent
night
or
day
the
roaring
of
hundreds
of
camels
now
being
unloaded
for
the
night
the
gibbering
of
the
mad
beggars
who
roam
perpetually
on
the
outskirts
of
the
encampments
like
wolves
seeking
what
they
may
devour
the
braying
of
donkeys
the
whinnying
of
horses
and
beneath
these
voices
of
living
things
foundation
of
their
uprising
vitality
pulsed
barbarous
music
the
throbbing
tomtoms
that
are
for
ever
heard
in
the
lands
of
the
sun
fetish
music
that
suggests
fatalism
and
the
grand
monotony
of
the
enormous
spaces
and
the
crude
passion
that
repeats
itself
and
the
untiring
sultry
loves
and
the
untired
sultry
languors
of
the
children
of
the
sun
the
silence
of
the
sands
which
domini
and
androvsky
had
known
and
loved
was
merged
in
the
tumult
of
the
sands
the
one
had
been
mystical
laying
the
soul
to
rest
the
other
was
provocative
calling
the
soul
to
wake
at
this
moment
the
sands
themselves
seemed
to
stir
with
life
and
to
cry
aloud
with
voices
the
very
sky
is
barbarous
domini
exclaimed
did
you
ever
see
such
colour
boris
over
the
minarets
it
is
like
a
great
wound
he
answered
no
wonder
men
are
careless
of
human
life
in
such
a
land
as
this
all
the
wildness
of
the
world
seems
to
be
concentrated
here
amara
is
like
the
desert
city
of
some
tremendous
dream
it
looks
wicked
and
unearthly
but
how
superb
look
at
those
cupolas
he
said
are
there
really
oriental
palaces
here
has
batouch
told
us
the
truth
for
once
or
less
than
the
truth
i
could
believe
anything
of
amara
at
this
moment
what
hundreds
of
camels
they
remind
me
of
arba
our
first
she
looked
at
him
and
he
at
her
how
long
ago
that
seems
she
said
a
thousand
years
they
both
had
a
memory
of
a
great
silence
in
the
midst
of
this
growing
tumult
in
which
the
sky
seemed
now
to
take
its
part
calling
with
the
voices
of
its
fierce
colours
with
the
voices
of
the
fires
that
burdened
it
in
the
west
silence
joined
us
domini
androvsky
said
yes
perhaps
silence
is
the
most
beautiful
voice
in
the
far
off
along
the
great
white
road
they
saw
two
horsemen
galloping
to
meet
them
from
the
city
one
dressed
in
brilliant
saffron
yellow
the
other
in
the
palest
blue
both
crowned
with
large
and
snowy
turbans
who
can
they
be
said
domini
as
they
drew
near
they
look
like
two
princes
of
the
then
she
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
batouch
and
ali
she
exclaimed
the
servants
galloped
up
then
without
slackening
speed
deftly
wheeled
their
horses
in
a
narrow
circle
and
were
beside
them
going
with
them
one
on
the
right
hand
the
other
on
the
left
bravo
domini
cried
delighted
at
this
feat
of
horsemanship
but
what
have
you
been
doing
you
are
transformed
madame
we
have
been
to
the
bain
maure
replied
batouch
calmly
swelling
out
his
broad
chest
under
his
yellow
jacket
laced
with
gold
we
have
had
our
heads
shaved
till
they
are
smooth
and
beautiful
as
polished
ivory
we
have
been
to
the
perfumer
he
leaned
confidentially
towards
her
exhaling
a
pungent
odour
of
amber
to
the
tailor
to
the
baboosh
bazaar
he
kicked
out
a
foot
cased
in
a
slipper
that
was
bright
almost
as
a
gold
piece
to
him
who
sells
the
he
shook
his
head
till
the
spangled
muslin
that
flowed
about
it
trembled
is
it
not
right
that
your
servants
should
do
you
honour
in
the
city
perfectly
right
she
answered
with
a
careful
seriousness
i
am
proud
of
you
and
monsieur
asked
ali
speaking
in
his
turn
androvsky
withdrew
his
eyes
from
the
city
which
was
now
near
at
hand
splendid
he
said
but
as
if
attending
to
the
arabs
with
difficulty
you
are
as
they
came
towards
the
old
wall
which
partially
surrounds
amara
and
which
rises
from
a
deep
natural
moat
of
sand
they
saw
that
the
ground
immediately
before
the
city
which
from
a
distance
had
looked
almost
fiat
was
in
reality
broken
up
into
a
series
of
wavelike
dunes
some
small
with
depressions
like
deep
crevices
between
them
others
large
with
summits
like
plateaux
these
dunes
were
of
a
sharp
lemon
yellow
in
the
evening
light
a
yellow
that
was
cold
in
its
clearness
almost
setting
the
teeth
on
edge
they
went
away
into
great
rolling
slopes
of
sand
on
which
the
camps
of
the
nomads
and
the
ouled
nails
were
pitched
some
near
to
some
distant
from
the
city
but
they
themselves
were
solitary
no
tents
were
pitched
close
to
the
city
under
the
shadow
of
its
wall
as
androvsky
spoke
domini
exclaimed
boris
that
is
the
most
extraordinary
thing
i
have
ever
seen
she
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
he
obeyed
her
eyes
and
looked
to
his
right
to
the
small
dunes
that
were
close
to
them
at
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
from
the
road
was
a
dune
that
ran
parallel
with
it
the
fire
of
the
sinking
sun
caught
its
smooth
crest
and
above
this
crest
moving
languidly
towards
the
city
were
visible
the
heads
and
busts
of
three
women
the
lower
halves
of
whose
bodies
were
concealed
by
the
sand
of
the
farther
side
of
the
dune
they
were
on
their
heads
piled
high
with
gorgeous
handkerchiefs
were
golden
crowns
which
glittered
in
the
and
tufts
of
scarlet
feathers
their
oval
faces
covered
with
paint
were
partially
concealed
by
long
strings
of
gold
coins
which
flowed
from
their
crowns
down
over
their
large
breasts
and
disappeared
towards
their
waists
which
were
hidden
by
the
sand
their
dresses
were
of
scarlet
and
purple
silks
partially
covered
by
floating
shawls
of
spangled
muslin
beneath
their
crowns
and
handkerchiefs
burgeoned
forth
plaits
of
false
hair
decorated
with
coral
and
silver
ornaments
their
hands
which
they
held
high
gesticulating
above
the
crest
of
the
dune
were
painted
blood
red
these
busts
and
heads
glided
slowly
along
in
the
setting
sun
and
presently
sank
down
and
vanished
into
some
depression
of
the
dunes
for
an
instant
one
hand
was
visible
alone
waving
a
signal
above
the
sand
to
someone
unseen
its
fingers
fluttered
like
the
wings
of
a
startled
bird
then
it
too
vanished
and
the
lemon
yellow
of
the
dunes
stretched
in
vivid
loneliness
beneath
the
evening
sky
to
both
of
them
this
brief
vision
of
women
in
the
sand
brought
home
the
solitude
of
the
desert
and
the
barbarity
of
the
life
it
held
the
ascetism
of
this
supreme
manifestation
of
nature
and
the
animal
passion
which
fructifies
in
its
heart
do
you
know
what
that
made
me
think
of
boris
domini
said
as
the
red
hand
with
its
fingers
disappeared
you
ll
smile
perhaps
and
i
scarcely
know
why
it
made
me
think
of
the
devil
in
a
androvsky
did
not
smile
nor
did
he
answer
she
felt
sure
that
he
too
had
been
strongly
affected
by
that
glimpse
of
sahara
life
his
silence
gave
batouch
an
opportunity
of
pouring
forth
upon
them
a
flood
of
poetical
description
of
the
of
amara
all
of
whom
he
seemed
to
know
as
intimate
friends
before
he
ceased
they
came
into
the
city
the
road
was
still
majestically
broad
they
looked
with
interest
at
the
first
houses
one
on
each
side
of
the
way
and
here
again
they
were
met
by
the
sharp
contrast
which
was
evidently
to
be
the
keynote
of
amara
the
house
on
the
left
was
european
built
of
white
stone
clean
attractive
but
uninteresting
with
stout
white
pillars
of
plaster
supporting
an
arcade
that
afforded
shade
from
the
sun
windows
with
green
blinds
and
an
open
doorway
showing
a
little
hall
on
the
floor
of
which
lay
a
smart
rug
glowing
with
gay
colours
that
on
the
right
before
which
the
sand
lay
deep
as
if
drifted
there
by
some
recent
wind
of
the
waste
was
african
and
barbarous
an
immense
and
rambling
building
of
brown
earth
brushwood
and
palm
windowless
with
a
roof
upon
which
were
piled
many
objects
like
things
collapsed
red
and
dark
green
with
fringes
and
rosettes
and
tall
sticks
of
palm
pointing
vaguely
to
the
sky
why
these
are
like
our
palanquin
domini
said
they
are
the
palanquins
of
the
madame
said
batouch
that
is
the
cafe
of
the
dancers
and
that
he
pointed
to
the
neat
house
opposite
is
the
house
of
monsieur
the
aumonier
of
aumonier
said
androvsky
sharply
here
he
paused
then
added
more
quietly
what
should
he
do
here
but
monsieur
he
is
for
the
french
there
are
french
officers
yes
monsieur
four
or
five
and
the
commandant
they
live
in
the
palace
with
the
i
forgot
androvsky
said
to
domini
we
are
not
out
of
the
sphere
of
french
influence
this
place
looks
so
remote
and
so
barbarous
that
i
imagined
it
given
over
entirely
to
the
desert
we
need
not
see
the
french
she
said
we
shall
be
encamped
outside
in
the
and
we
need
not
stay
here
long
he
said
quickly
boris
she
asked
him
half
in
jest
half
in
earnest
shall
we
buy
a
desert
island
to
live
in
let
us
buy
an
oasis
he
said
that
would
be
the
perf
the
safest
life
for
the
safest
the
safest
for
our
happiness
domini
i
have
a
horror
of
the
world
he
said
the
last
words
with
a
strong
almost
fierce
emphasis
had
you
it
always
or
only
since
we
have
been
married
i
perhaps
it
was
born
in
me
perhaps
it
is
part
of
me
who
knows
he
had
relapsed
into
a
gravity
that
was
heavy
with
gloom
and
looked
about
him
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
wish
to
reject
all
that
offered
itself
to
their
sight
i
want
the
desert
and
you
in
it
he
said
the
lonely
desert
with
and
nothing
else
i
want
that
i
can
not
have
that
taken
from
he
looked
about
him
quickly
from
side
to
side
as
they
rode
up
the
street
as
if
he
were
a
scout
sent
in
advance
of
an
army
and
suspected
ambushes
his
manner
reminded
her
of
the
way
he
had
looked
towards
the
tower
as
they
rode
into
mogar
and
he
had
connected
that
tower
with
the
french
she
remembered
his
saying
to
her
that
it
must
have
been
built
for
french
soldiers
as
they
rode
into
mogar
he
had
dreaded
something
in
mogar
the
strange
incident
with
de
trevignac
had
followed
she
had
put
it
from
her
mind
as
a
matter
of
small
or
no
importance
had
resolutely
forgotten
it
had
been
able
to
forget
it
in
their
dream
of
desert
life
and
desert
passion
but
the
entry
into
a
city
for
the
moment
destroyed
the
dreamlike
atmosphere
woven
by
the
desert
recalled
her
town
sense
that
that
sharpness
of
apprehension
and
swiftness
of
observation
which
are
bred
in
those
who
have
long
been
accustomed
to
a
life
in
the
midst
of
crowds
and
movement
and
changing
scenes
and
passing
fashions
suddenly
she
seemed
to
herself
to
be
reading
androvsky
with
an
almost
merciless
penetration
which
yet
she
could
not
check
he
had
dreaded
something
in
mogar
he
dreaded
something
here
in
amara
an
unusual
incident
for
the
coming
of
a
stranger
into
their
lives
out
of
their
desolation
of
the
sand
was
unusual
had
followed
close
upon
the
first
dread
would
another
such
incident
follow
upon
this
second
dread
and
of
what
was
this
dread
born
batouch
drew
her
attention
to
the
fact
that
they
were
coming
to
the
marketplace
and
to
the
curious
crowds
of
people
who
were
swarming
out
of
the
tortuous
narrow
streets
into
the
main
thoroughfare
to
watch
them
pass
or
to
accompany
them
running
beside
their
horses
she
divined
at
once
by
the
passionate
curiosity
their
entry
aroused
that
he
had
misspent
his
leisure
in
spreading
through
the
city
lying
reports
of
their
immense
importance
and
fabulous
riches
batouch
she
said
you
have
been
talking
about
no
madame
i
merely
said
that
madame
is
a
great
lady
in
her
own
land
and
that
monsieur
i
forbid
you
ever
to
speak
about
me
batouch
said
androvsky
brusquely
he
seemed
worried
by
the
clamour
of
the
increasing
mob
that
surrounded
them
children
in
long
robes
like
skipped
before
them
calling
out
in
shrill
voices
old
beggars
with
diseased
eyes
and
deformed
limbs
laid
filthy
hands
upon
their
bridles
and
demanded
alms
impudent
boys
like
bronze
statuettes
suddenly
endowed
with
a
fury
of
life
progressed
backwards
to
keep
them
full
in
view
shouting
information
at
them
and
proclaiming
their
own
transcendent
virtues
as
guides
lithe
desert
men
almost
naked
but
with
heads
strode
beside
them
keeping
pace
with
the
horses
saying
nothing
but
watching
them
with
a
bright
intentness
that
seemed
to
hint
at
unutterable
designs
and
towards
them
through
the
air
that
seemed
heavy
and
almost
suffocating
now
that
they
were
among
buildings
and
through
clouds
of
buzzing
flies
came
the
noise
of
the
larger
tumult
of
the
looking
over
the
heads
of
the
throng
domini
saw
the
wide
road
opening
out
into
a
great
space
with
the
first
palms
of
the
oasis
thronging
on
the
left
and
a
cluster
of
buildings
many
with
small
cupolas
like
white
cups
on
the
right
on
the
farther
side
of
this
space
which
was
black
with
people
clad
for
the
most
in
dingy
garments
was
an
arcade
jutting
out
from
a
number
of
houses
and
to
the
right
of
them
where
the
making
a
wide
sweep
continued
up
hill
and
was
hidden
from
her
view
was
the
end
of
the
great
building
whose
gilded
cupolas
they
had
seen
as
they
rode
in
from
the
desert
rising
above
the
city
with
the
minarets
of
its
mosques
the
flies
buzzed
furiously
about
the
horses
heads
and
flanks
and
the
people
buzzed
more
furiously
like
larger
flies
about
the
riders
it
seemed
to
domini
as
if
the
whole
city
was
intent
upon
her
and
androvsky
was
observing
them
considering
them
wondering
about
them
was
full
of
a
thousand
intentions
all
connected
with
them
when
they
gained
the
the
noise
and
the
watchful
curiosity
made
a
violent
crescendo
it
happened
to
be
market
day
and
although
the
sun
was
setting
buying
and
selling
were
not
yet
over
on
the
hot
earth
over
which
whenever
there
is
any
wind
from
the
desert
the
white
sand
grains
sift
and
settle
were
laid
innumerable
rugs
of
gaudy

piteous
noise
that
is
the
of
the
desert
the
multitudinous
complaining
of
camels
dominating
all
other
sounds
as
domini
and
androvsky
rode
into
this
whirlpool
of
humanity
above
which
the
sky
was
red
like
a
great
wound
it
flowed
and
eddied
round
them
making
them
its
centre
the
arrival
of
a
was
a
rare
if
not
an
unparalleled
event
in
amara
and
batouch
had
been
very
busy
in
spreading
the
fame
of
his
mistress
madame
should
dismount
said
batouch
ali
will
take
the
horses
and
i
will
escort
madame
and
monsieur
up
the
hill
to
the
place
of
the
fountain
shabah
will
be
there
to
greet
what
an
uproar
domini
exclaimed
half
laughing
half
confused
who
on
earth
is
shabah
shabah
is
the
caid
of
amara
replied
batouch
with
dignity
the
greatest
man
of
the
city
he
awaits
madame
by
the
domini
cast
a
glance
at
androvsky
well
she
said
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
like
a
man
who
thinks
strife
useless
and
the
moment
come
for
giving
in
to
fate
the
monster
has
opened
his
jaws
for
us
he
said
forcing
a
laugh
we
had
better
walk
in
i
suppose
but
o
domini
the
silence
of
the
wastes
we
shall
know
it
again
this
is
only
for
the
moment
we
shall
have
all
its
joy
who
knows
he
said
as
he
had
said
when
they
were
riding
up
the
sand
slope
who
knows
then
they
got
off
their
horses
and
were
taken
by
the
crowd
chapter
xxii
the
tumult
of
amara
waked
up
in
domini
the
that
had
been
slumbering
all
that
seemed
to
confuse
to
daze
to
repel
androvsky
even
to
inspire
him
with
fear
the
noise
of
the
teeming
crowds
their
perpetual
movement
their
contact
startled
her
into
a
vividness
of
life
and
apprehension
of
its
various
meanings
that
sent
a
thrill
through
her
and
the
thrill
was
musical
with
happiness
to
the
sad
a
great
vision
of
human
life
brings
sadness
because
they
read
into
the
hearts
of
others
their
own
misery
but
to
the
happy
such
a
vision
brings
exultation
for
everywhere
they
find
dancing
reflections
of
their
own
joy
domini
had
lived
much
in
crowds
but
always
she
had
been
actively
unhappy
or
at
least
coldly
dreary
in
them
now
for
the
first
time
she
was
surrounded
by
masses
of
in
her
splendid
contentment
and
the
effect
of
this
return
as
it
were
to
something
like
the
former
material
conditions
of
her
life
with
the
mental
and
affectional
conditions
of
it
transformed
by
joy
was
striking
even
to
herself
suddenly
she
realised
to
the
full
her
own
humanity
and
the
living
warmth
of
sympathy
that
is
fanned
into
flame
in
a
human
heart
by
the
presence
of
human
life
with
its
hopes
desires
fears
passions
joys
that
leap
to
the
eye
instead
of
hating
this
fierce
change
from
solitude
with
the
man
she
loved
to
a
crowd
with
the
man
she
loved
she
rejoiced
in
it
androvsky
was
the
cause
of
both
her
joys
joy
in
the
waste
and
joy
in
amara
but
while
he
shared
the
one
he
did
not
share
the
other
this
did
not
surprise
her
because
of
the
conditions
in
which
he
had
lived
he
was
and
had
always
dwelt
far
from
towns
she
was
returning
to
an
old
experience
old
for
the
london
crowd
and
the
crowd
of
amara
were
both
crowds
of
men
however
different
with
a
mind
transformed
by
happiness
to
him
the
experience
was
new
something
within
her
told
her
that
it
was
necessary
that
it
had
been
ordained
because
he
needed
it
the
recalled
with
its
sharpness
of
observation
persisted
as
she
rode
in
to
amara
she
had
seemed
to
herself
to
be
reading
androvsky
with
an
almost
merciless
penetration
which
yet
she
could
not
check
now
she
did
not
wish
to
check
it
for
the
penetration
that
is
founded
on
perfect
love
can
only
yield
good
fruit
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
allowed
to
see
clearly
for
androvsky
what
he
could
not
see
himself
almost
as
the
mother
sees
for
the
child
this
contact
with
the
crowds
of
amara
was
she
thought
one
of
the
gifts
the
desert
made
to
him
he
did
not
like
it
he
wished
to
reject
it
but
he
was
mistaken
for
the
moment
his
vision
was
clouded
as
our
vision
for
ourselves
so
often
is
she
realised
this
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
marriage
service
at
perhaps
seemed
to
be
selfish
she
opposed
his
wish
hitherto
there
had
never
been
any
sort
of
contest
between
them
their
desires
like
their
hearts
had
been
in
accord
now
there
was
not
a
contest
for
androvsky
yielded
to
domini
s
preference
when
she
expressed
it
with
a
quickness
that
set
his
passion
before
her
in
a
new
and
beautiful
light
but
she
knew
that
for
the
moment
they
were
not
in
accord
he
hated
and
dreaded
what
she
encountered
with
a
vivid
sensation
of
sympathy
and
joy
she
felt
that
there
was
something
morbid
in
his
horror
of
the
crowd
and
the
same
strength
of
her
nature
said
to
her
uproot
it
their
camp
was
pitched
on
the
to
the
north
of
the
city
near
the
french
and
arab
cemeteries
they
reached
it
only
when
darkness
was
falling
going
out
of
the
city
on
foot
by
the
great
wall
of
dressed
stone
which
enclosed
the
kasba
of
the
native
soldiers
and
ascending
and
descending
various
slopes
of
deep
sand
over
which
the
airs
of
night
blew
with
a
peculiar
thin
freshness
that
renewed
domini
s
sense
of
being
at
the
end
of
the
world
everything
here
whispered
the
same
message
said
we
are
the
denizens
of
in
their
walk
to
the
camp
they
were
accompanied
by
a
little
procession
shabah
the
caid
of
amara
a
shortish
man
whose
immense
dignity
made
him
almost
gigantic
insisted
upon
attending
them
to
the
tents
with
his
young
brother
a
pretty
libertine
boy
of
sixteen
the
brother
s
tutor
an
arab
black
as
a
negro
but
without
the
negro
s
look
of
having
been
freshly
oiled
and
two
attendants
to
them
joined
himself
the
caid
of
the
nomads
a
swarthy
potentate
who
not
only
looked
but
actually
was
immense
his
four
servants
and
his
uncle
a
venerable
person
like
a
shepherd
king
these
worthies
surrounded
domini
and
androvsky
and
behind
streamed
the
curious
the
envious
the
greedy
and
the
desultory
arabs
who
follow
in
the
trail
of
every
stranger
hopeful
of
the
crumbs
that
are
said
to
fall
from
the
rich
man
s
table
shabah
spoke
french
and
led
the
conversation
which
was
devoted
chiefly
to
his
condition
of
health
some
years
before
an
attempt
had
been
made
upon
his
life
by
poison
and
since
that
time
as
he
himself
expressed
it
his
stomach
had
been
perturbed
as
a
guard
dog
in
the
night
when
robbers
are
all
efforts
to
console
or
to
inspire
him
with
hope
of
future
cure
were
met
with
a
stern
hopelessness
a
brusque
certainty
of
perpetual
suffering
the
idea
that
his
stomach
could
again
know
peace
evidently
shocked
and
distressed
him
and
as
they
all
waded
together
through
the
sand
pioneered
by
the
glorified
batouch
domini
was
obliged
to
yield
to
his
emphatic
despair
and
to
join
with
him
in
his
appreciation
of
the
perpetual
indigestion
which
set
him
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
like
some
god
within
a
shrine
the
skittish
boy
his
brother
who
wore
kid
gloves
cast
at
her
sly
glances
of
admiration
which
asked
for
a
return
the
black
tutor
grinned
and
the
caid
of
the
nomads
punctuated
their
progress
with
loud
grunts
of
heavy
satisfaction
occasionally
making
use
of
batouch
as
interpreter
to
express
his
hopes
that
they
would
visit
his
palace
in
the
town
and
devour
a
on
his
carpet
when
they
came
to
the
tents
it
was
necessary
to
entertain
these
personages
with
coffee
and
they
finally
departed
promising
a
speedy
return
and
full
of
invitations
which
were
cordially
accepted
by
batouch
on
his
employer
s
behalf
before
either
domini
or
androvsky
had
time
to
say
a
word
as
the
disappeared
over
the
sands
towards
the
city
domini
burst
into
a
little
laugh
and
drew
androvsky
out
to
the
tent
door
to
see
them
go
society
in
the
sands
she
exclaimed
gaily
boris
this
is
a
new
experience
look
at
our
guests
making
their
way
to
their
palaces
slowly
the
potentates
progressed
across
the
white
dunes
towards
the
city
shabah
wore
a
long
red
cloak
his
brother
was
in
pink
and
gold
with
white
billowing
trousers
the
caid
of
the
nomads
was
in
green
they
all
moved
with
a
large
and
conscious
majesty
surrounded
by
their
obsequious
attendants
above
them
the
purple
sky
showed
a
bright
evening
star
near
it
was
visible
the
delicate
silhouette
of
the
young
moon
scattered
over
the
waste
rose
many
koubbahs
grey
in
the
white
with
cupolas
of
gypse
hundreds
of
dogs
were
barking
in
the
distance
to
the
left
on
the
vast
rolling
slopes
of
sand
glared
the
innumerable
fires
kindled
before
the
tents
of
the
ouled
nails
before
the
sleeping
tent
rose
the
minarets
and
the
gilded
cupolas
of
the
city
which
it
dominated
from
its
mountain
of
sand
behind
it
was
the
blanched
immensity
of
the
plain
of
the
lonely
desert
from
which
domini
and
androvsky
had
come
to
face
this
barbaric
stir
of
life
and
the
city
was
full
of
music
of
tomtoms
throbbing
of
bugles
blowing
in
the
kasba
of
pipes
shrieking
from
hidden
dwellings
and
of
the
faint
but
multitudinous
voices
of
men
carried
to
them
on
their
desolate
and
treeless
height
by
the
frail
wind
of
night
that
seemed
a
white
wind
of
the
sands
let
us
go
a
step
or
two
towards
the
city
boris
domini
said
as
their
guests
sank
magnificently
down
into
a
fold
of
the
dunes
towards
the
city
he
answered
why
not
he
glanced
behind
him
to
the
vacant
noiseless
sands
she
set
her
impulse
against
his
for
the
first
time
no
this
is
our
town
life
our
sahara
season
let
us
give
ourselves
to
it
the
loneliness
will
be
its
antidote
some
very
well
domini
he
answered
they
went
a
little
way
towards
the
city
and
stood
still
in
the
sand
at
the
edge
of
their
height
listen
boris
isn
t
it
strange
in
the
night
all
this
barbaric
music
it
excites
you
are
glad
to
be
she
heard
the
note
of
disappointment
in
his
voice
but
did
not
respond
to
it
and
look
at
all
those
fires
hundreds
of
them
in
the
sand
yes
he
said
it
is
wonderful
but
the
solitudes
are
best
this
is
not
the
heart
of
the
desert
this
is
what
the
arabs
call
it
the
belly
of
the
in
the
heart
of
the
desert
there
is
she
thought
of
the
falling
of
the
wind
when
the
sahara
took
them
and
knew
that
her
love
of
the
silence
was
intense
nevertheless
the
other
part
of
her
was
in
the
ascendant
she
wanted
him
to
share
it
he
did
not
could
she
provoke
him
to
share
it
yet
as
we
rode
in
i
had
a
feeling
that
the
heart
of
the
desert
was
here
she
said
you
know
i
said
do
you
say
so
still
the
heart
boris
is
the
centre
of
life
isn
t
it
he
was
silent
she
felt
his
inner
feeling
fighting
hers
she
said
putting
her
arm
through
his
and
looking
towards
the
city
i
feel
a
tremendous
sympathy
with
human
life
such
as
i
never
felt
before
boris
it
comes
to
me
from
you
yes
it
does
it
is
born
of
my
love
for
you
and
seems
to
link
me
and
you
with
me
to
all
these
strangers
to
all
men
and
women
to
everything
that
lives
it
is
as
if
i
was
not
quite
human
before
and
my
love
for
you
had
made
me
completely
human
had
done
something
to
me
that
even
even
my
love
for
god
had
not
been
able
to
she
lowered
her
voice
at
the
last
words
after
a
moment
she
added
perhaps
in
isolation
even
with
you
i
could
not
come
to
completeness
perhaps
you
could
not
in
isolation
even
with
me
boris
i
think
it
s
good
for
us
to
be
in
the
midst
of
life
for
a
you
wish
to
remain
here
domini
yes
for
a
the
fatalistic
feeling
that
had
sometimes
come
upon
her
in
this
land
entered
into
her
at
this
moment
she
felt
it
is
written
that
we
are
to
remain
let
us
remain
here
domini
he
said
quietly
the
note
of
disappointment
had
gone
out
of
his
voice
deliberately
banished
from
it
by
his
love
for
her
but
she
seemed
to
hear
it
nevertheless
echoing
far
down
in
his
soul
at
that
moment
she
loved
him
like
a
woman
he
had
made
a
lover
but
also
like
a
woman
he
had
made
a
mother
by
becoming
a
child
thank
you
boris
she
answered
very
quietly
you
are
good
to
you
are
good
to
me
he
said
remembering
the
last
words
of
father
roubier
how
can
i
be
anything
else
directly
he
had
spoken
the
words
his
body
trembled
violently
boris
what
is
it
she
exclaimed
startled
he
took
his
arm
away
from
hers
these
these
noises
of
the
city
in
the
night
coming
across
the
are
extraordinary
i
have
become
so
used
to
silence
that
perhaps
they
get
upon
my
nerves
i
shall
grow
accustomed
to
them
he
turned
towards
the
tents
and
she
went
with
him
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
had
evaded
her
question
that
he
had
not
wished
to
answer
it
and
the
sense
sharply
awakened
in
her
by
a
return
to
life
near
a
city
made
her
probe
for
the
reason
of
this
she
did
not
find
it
but
in
her
mental
search
she
found
herself
presently
at
mogar
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
same
sort
of
uneasiness
which
had
beset
her
husband
at
mogar
beset
him
now
more
fiercely
at
amara
that
as
he
had
just
said
his
nerves
were
being
tortured
by
something
but
it
could
not
be
the
noises
from
the
city
after
dinner
batouch
came
to
the
tent
to
suggest
that
they
should
go
down
with
him
into
the
city
domini
feeling
certain
that
androvsky
would
not
wish
to
go
at
once
refused
alleging
that
she
was
tired
batouch
then
asked
androvsky
to
go
with
him
and
to
domini
s
astonishment
he
said
that
if
she
did
not
mind
his
leaving
her
for
a
short
time
he
would
like
a
stroll
perhaps
he
said
to
her
as
batouch
and
he
were
starting
perhaps
it
will
make
me
more
completely
human
perhaps
there
is
something
still
to
be
done
that
even
you
domini
have
not
she
knew
he
was
alluding
to
her
words
before
dinner
he
stood
looking
at
her
with
a
slight
smile
that
did
not
suggest
happiness
then
added
that
link
you
spoke
of
between
us
and
these
strangers
he
made
a
gesture
towards
the
city
i
ought
perhaps
to
feel
it
more
strongly
than
i
do
i
i
will
try
to
feel
then
he
turned
away
and
went
with
batouch
across
the
walking
heavily
as
domini
watched
him
going
she
felt
chilled
because
there
was
something
in
his
manner
in
his
smile
that
seemed
for
the
moment
to
set
them
apart
from
each
other
something
she
did
not
understand
soon
androvsky
disappeared
in
a
fold
of
the
sands
as
he
had
disappeared
in
a
fold
of
the
sands
at
mogar
not
long
before
de
trevignac
came
she
thought
of
mogar
once
more
steadily
reviewing
mentally
with
the
renewed
sharpness
of
intellect
that
had
returned
to
her
brought
by
contact
with
the
city
all
that
had
passed
there
as
she
never
reviewed
it
before
it
had
been
a
strange
episode
she
began
to
walk
slowly
up
and
down
on
the
sand
before
the
tent
ouardi
came
to
walk
with
her
but
she
sent
him
away
before
doing
so
however
something
moved
her
to
ask
him
that
african
liqueur
ouardi
you
remember
that
you
brought
to
the
tent
at
mogar
have
we
any
more
of
it
the
monk
s
liqueur
madame
what
do
you
mean
monk
s
liqueur
it
was
invented
by
a
monk
madame
and
is
sold
by
the
monks
of
oh
have
we
any
more
of
it
there
is
another
bottle
madame
but
i
should
not
dare
to
bring
it
if
he
paused
if
what
ouardi
if
monsieur
were
domini
was
on
the
point
of
asking
him
why
but
she
checked
herself
and
told
him
to
leave
her
then
she
walked
up
and
down
once
more
on
the
sand
she
was
thinking
now
of
the
broken
glass
on
the
ground
at
androvsky
s
feet
when
she
found
him
alone
in
the
tent
after
de
trevignac
had
gone
ouardi
s
words
made
her
wonder
whether
this
liqueur
brought
to
celebrate
de
trevignac
s
presence
in
the
camp
had
turned
the
conversation
upon
the
subject
of
the
religious
orders
whether
androvsky
had
perhaps
said
something
against
them
which
had
offended
de
trevignac
a
staunch
catholic
whether
there
had
been
a
quarrel
between
the
two
men
on
the
subject
of
religion
it
was
possible
she
remembered
de
trevignac
s
strange
almost
mystical
gesture
in
the
dawn
following
his
look
of
horror
towards
the
tent
where
her
husband
lay
sleeping
her
mind
her
whole
nature
felt
terribly
alive
she
tried
to
think
no
more
of
mogar
but
her
thoughts
centred
round
it
linked
it
with
this
great
city
whose
lights
shone
in
the
distance
below
her
whose
music
came
to
her
from
afar
over
the
silence
of
the
sands
mogar
and
amara
what
had
they
to
do
with
one
another
leagues
of
desert
divided
them
one
was
a
desolation
the
other
was
crowded
with
men
what
linked
them
together
in
her
mind
androvsky
s
fear
of
both
that
was
the
link
she
kept
on
thinking
of
the
glance
he
had
cast
at
the
to
which
trevignac
had
been
even
then
approaching
although
they
knew
it
not
de
trevignac
she
walked
faster
on
the
sand
to
and
fro
before
the
tent
why
had
he
looked
at
the
tent
in
which
androvsky
slept
with
horror
was
it
because
androvsky
had
denounced
the
religion
that
he
reverenced
and
loved
could
it
have
been
that
but
then
did
androvsky
actively
hate
religion
perhaps
he
hated
it
and
concealed
his
hatred
from
her
because
he
knew
it
would
cause
her
pain
yet
she
had
sometimes
felt
as
if
he
were
seeking
perhaps
with
fear
perhaps
with
ignorance
perhaps
with
uncertainty
but
still
seeking
to
draw
near
to
god
that
was
why
she
had
been
able
to
hope
for
him
why
she
had
not
been
more
troubled
by
his
loss
of
the
faith
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
and
to
which
she
belonged
heart
and
soul
could
she
have
been
wrong
in
her
feeling
deceived
there
were
men
in
the
world
she
knew
who
denied
the
existence
of
a
god
and
bitterly
ridiculed
all
faith
she
remembered
the
blasphemies
of
her
father
had
she
married
a
man
who
like
him
was
lost
who
as
he
had
furiously
denied
god
a
cold
thrill
of
fear
came
into
her
heart
suddenly
she
felt
as
if
perhaps
even
in
her
love
androvsky
had
been
a
stranger
to
her
she
stood
upon
the
sand
it
chanced
that
she
looked
towards
the
camp
of
the
ouled
nails
whose
fires
blazed
upon
the
dunes
while
she
looked
she
was
presently
aware
of
a
light
that
detached
itself
from
the
blaze
of
the
fires
and
moved
from
them
coming
towards
the
place
where
she
was
standing
slowly
the
young
moon
only
gave
a
faint
ray
to
the
night
this
light
travelled
onward
through
the
dimness
like
an
star
she
watched
it
with
intentness
as
people
watch
any
moving
thing
when
their
minds
are
eagerly
at
work
staring
yet
scarcely
conscious
that
they
see
the
little
light
moved
steadily
on
over
the
sands
now
descending
the
side
of
a
dune
now
mounting
to
a
crest
and
always
coming
towards
the
place
where
domini
was
standing
and
presently
this
determined
movement
towards
her
caught
hold
of
her
mind
drew
it
away
from
other
thoughts
fixed
it
on
the
light
she
became
interested
in
it
intent
upon
it
who
was
bearing
it
no
doubt
some
desert
man
some
arab
she
imagined
him
tall
brown
lithe
holding
the
lamp
in
his
muscular
fingers
treading
on
bare
feet
silently
over
the
deep
sand
why
had
he
left
the
camp
what
was
his
purpose
the
light
drew
near
it
was
now
moving
over
the
flats
and
seemed
she
thought
to
travel
more
quickly
and
always
it
came
straight
towards
where
she
was
standing
a
conviction
dawned
in
her
that
it
was
travelling
with
an
intention
of
reaching
her
that
it
was
carried
by
someone
who
was
thinking
of
her
but
how
could
that
be
she
thought
of
the
light
as
a
thing
with
a
mind
and
a
purpose
borne
by
someone
who
backed
up
its
purpose
helping
it
to
do
what
it
wanted
and
it
wanted
to
come
to
her
in
mogar
androvsky
had
dreaded
something
in
mogar
de
trevignac
had
come
he
dreaded
something
in
amara
this
light
came
for
an
instant
she
fancied
that
the
light
was
a
lamp
carried
by
de
trevignac
then
she
saw
that
it
gleamed
upon
a
long
black
robe
the
soutane
of
a
priest
as
she
and
androvsky
rode
into
amara
she
had
asked
herself
whether
his
second
dread
would
be
followed
as
his
first
dread
had
been
by
an
unusual
incident
when
she
saw
the
soutane
of
a
priest
black
in
the
lamplight
moving
towards
her
over
the
whiteness
of
the
sand
she
said
to
herself
that
it
was
to
be
so
followed
this
priest
stood
in
the
place
of
de
trevignac
why
did
he
come
to
her
chapter
xxiii
when
the
priest
drew
close
to
the
tent
domini
saw
that
it
was
not
he
who
carried
the
lantern
but
a
native
soldier
one
of
the
tirailleurs
formerly
called
turcos
who
walked
beside
him
the
soldier
saluted
her
and
the
priest
took
off
his
broad
fluffy
black
hat
madame
he
said
speaking
french
with
the
accent
of
marseilles
i
am
the
aumonier
of
amara
and
have
just
heard
of
your
arrival
here
and
as
i
was
visiting
my
friends
on
the
yonder
i
thought
i
would
venture
to
call
and
ask
whether
i
could
be
of
any
service
to
you
the
hour
is
informal
i
know
but
to
tell
the
truth
madame
after
five
years
in
amara
one
does
not
know
how
to
be
formal
any
his
eyes
which
had
a
slightly
impudent
look
rare
in
a
priest
but
not
unpleasing
twinkled
cheerfully
in
the
lamplight
as
he
spoke
and
his
whole
expression
betokened
a
highly
social
disposition
and
the
most
genuine
pleasure
at
meeting
with
a
stranger
while
she
looked
at
him
and
heard
him
speak
domini
laughed
at
herself
for
the
imaginations
she
had
just
been
cherishing
he
had
a
broad
figure
long
arms
large
feet
encased
in
stout
comfortable
boots
his
face
was
burnt
brown
by
the
sun
and
partially
concealed
by
a
heavy
black
beard
whiskers
and
moustache
his
features
were
blunt
and
looked
boyish
though
his
age
must
have
been
about
forty
the
nose
was
snub
and
accorded
with
the
expression
in
his
eyes
which
were
black
like
his
hair
and
full
of
twinkling
lights
as
he
smiled
genially
on
domini
he
showed
two
rows
of
small
square
white
teeth
his
marseilles
accent
exactly
suited
his
appearance
which
was
rough
but
honest
domini
welcomed
him
gladly
indeed
her
reception
of
him
was
more
than
cordial
almost
eager
for
she
had
been
vaguely
expecting
some
tragic
figure
some
personality
suggestive
of
mystery
or
sorrow
and
she
thought
of
the
incidents
at
mogar
and
associated
the
moving
light
with
the
approach
of
further
strange
events
this
homely
figure
of
her
religion
beaming
satisfaction
and
comfortable
anticipation
of
friendly
intercourse
laid
to
rest
fears
which
only
now
when
she
was
conscious
of
relief
she
knew
she
had
been
entertaining
she
begged
the
priest
to
come
into
the
and
taking
up
the
little
bell
which
was
on
the
table
went
out
into
the
sand
and
rang
it
for
ouardi
he
came
at
once
like
a
shadow
gliding
over
the
waste
bring
us
coffee
for
two
ouardi
biscuits
she
glanced
at
her
visitor
yes
the
in
the
white
box
and
the
cigars
and
take
the
soldier
with
you
and
entertain
him
well
give
him
whatever
he
ouardi
went
away
with
the
soldier
talking
frantically
and
domini
returned
to
the
tent
where
she
found
the
priest
gleaming
with
joyous
anticipation
they
sat
down
in
the
comfortable
basket
chairs
before
the
tent
door
through
which
they
could
see
the
shining
of
the
city
s
lights
and
hear
the
distant
sound
of
its
throbbing
and
wailing
music
my
husband
has
gone
to
see
the
city
domini
said
after
she
had
told
the
priest
her
name
and
been
informed
that
his
was
max
beret
we
only
arrived
this
i
know
he
beamed
on
her
and
stroked
his
thick
beard
with
his
broad
sunburnt
hand
everyone
in
amara
knows
and
everyone
in
the
tents
we
know
too
how
many
tents
you
have
how
many
servants
how
many
camels
horses
he
broke
into
a
hearty
laugh
we
know
what
you
ve
just
had
for
dinner
domini
laughed
too
not
really
well
i
heard
in
the
camp
that
it
was
soup
and
stewed
mutton
but
never
mind
you
must
forgive
us
we
are
barbarians
we
are
we
are
ruffians
of
the
sun
his
laugh
was
infectious
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
shook
with
the
mirth
his
own
remarks
had
roused
we
are
ruffians
of
the
sun
he
repeated
with
gusto
and
we
must
be
forgiven
although
clad
in
a
soutane
he
looked
at
that
moment
like
a
type
of
the
most
joyous
tolerance
and
domini
could
not
help
mentally
comparing
him
with
the
priest
of
what
would
father
roubier
think
of
father
beret
it
is
easy
to
forgive
in
the
sun
domini
said
the
priest
laid
his
hands
on
his
knees
setting
his
feet
well
apart
she
noticed
that
his
hands
were
not
scrupulously
clean
madame
he
said
it
is
impossible
to
be
anything
but
lenient
in
the
sun
that
is
my
experience
excuse
me
but
are
you
a
catholic
so
much
the
better
you
must
let
me
show
you
the
chapel
it
is
in
the
building
with
the
cupolas
the
congregation
consists
of
five
on
a
full
his
laugh
broke
out
again
i
hope
the
day
after
you
and
your
husband
will
make
it
seven
but
as
i
was
saying
the
sun
teaches
one
a
lesson
of
charity
when
i
first
came
to
live
in
africa
in
the
midst
of
the
eh
madame
i
suppose
as
a
priest
i
ought
to
have
been
shocked
by
their
and
indeed
i
tried
to
be
i
conscientiously
did
my
best
but
it
was
no
good
i
couldn
t
be
shocked
the
sunshine
drove
it
all
out
of
me
i
could
only
say
it
is
not
for
me
to
question
bon
and
bon
has
created
these
people
and
set
them
here
in
the
sand
to
behave
as
they
what
is
my
business
i
can
t
convert
them
i
can
t
change
their
morals
i
must
just
be
a
friend
to
them
cheer
them
up
in
their
sorrows
give
them
a
bit
if
they
re
starving
doctor
them
a
little
i
m
a
hand
at
making
an
arab
take
a
pill
or
a
powder
when
they
are
ill
and
make
them
at
home
with
the
white
marabout
that
s
what
the
sun
has
taught
me
and
every
and
s
child
in
amara
is
a
friend
of
he
stretched
out
his
legs
as
if
he
wished
to
elongate
his
satisfaction
and
stared
domini
full
in
the
face
with
eyes
that
confidently
naively
asked
for
her
approval
of
his
doctrine
of
the
sun
she
could
not
help
liking
him
though
she
felt
more
as
if
she
were
sitting
with
a
jolly
big
and
rather
rowdy
boy
than
with
a
priest
you
are
fond
of
the
arabs
then
she
said
of
course
i
am
madame
i
can
speak
their
language
and
i
m
as
much
at
home
in
their
tents
and
more
than
i
should
ever
be
at
the
vatican
with
all
respect
to
the
holy
he
got
up
went
out
into
the
sand
expectorated
noisily
then
returned
to
the
tent
wiping
his
bearded
mouth
with
a
large
red
cotton
are
you
staying
here
long
madame
he
sat
down
again
in
his
chair
making
it
creak
with
his
substantial
weight
i
don
t
know
if
my
husband
is
happy
here
but
he
prefers
the
solitudes
i
does
he
and
yet
he
s
gone
into
the
city
plenty
of
bustle
there
at
night
i
can
tell
you
well
now
i
don
t
agree
with
your
husband
i
know
it
s
been
said
that
solitude
is
good
for
the
sad
but
i
think
just
the
contrary
ah
the
last
sonorously
joyous
exclamation
jumped
out
of
father
beret
at
the
sight
of
ouardi
who
at
this
moment
entered
with
a
large
tray
covered
with
a
cups
biscuits
cigars
and
a
bulging
flask
of
some
liqueur
flanked
by
little
glasses
you
fare
generously
in
the
desert
i
see
madame
he
exclaimed
and
so
much
the
better
what
s
your
servant
s
name
domini
told
him
ouardi
that
means
born
in
the
time
of
the
he
addressed
ouardi
in
arabic
and
sent
him
off
into
the
darkness
chuckling
gaily
these
arab
names
all
have
their
meanings
onlagareb
mother
of
scorpions
omteoni
mother
of
eagles
and
so
on
so
much
the
better
comforts
are
rare
here
but
you
carry
them
with
you
sugar
if
you
domini
put
two
lumps
into
his
cup
if
you
allow
me
he
added
two
more
i
never
refuse
a
good
cigar
these
harmless
joys
are
excellent
for
man
they
help
his
christianity
they
keep
him
from
bitterness
harsh
judgments
but
harshness
is
for
northern
climes
rainy
england
eh
forgive
me
madame
i
speak
in
joke
you
come
from
england
perhaps
it
didn
t
occur
to
me
that
they
both
laughed
his
garrulity
was
irresistible
and
made
domini
feel
as
if
she
were
sitting
with
a
child
perhaps
he
caught
her
feeling
for
he
added
the
desert
has
made
me
an
i
fear
what
have
you
there
his
eyes
had
been
attracted
by
the
flask
of
liqueur
to
which
domini
was
stretching
out
her
hand
with
the
intention
of
giving
him
some
i
don
t
she
leaned
forward
to
read
the
name
on
the
flask
l
o
u
a
r
i
n
e
she
said
pst
exclaimed
the
priest
with
a
start
will
you
have
some
i
don
t
know
whether
it
s
good
i
ve
never
tasted
it
or
seen
it
before
will
you
have
some
she
felt
so
absolutely
certain
that
he
would
say
yes
that
she
lifted
the
flask
to
pour
the
liqueur
into
one
of
the
little
glasses
but
looking
at
him
she
saw
that
he
hesitated
after
all
why
not
he
ejaculated
why
not
she
was
holding
the
flask
over
the
glass
he
saw
that
his
remark
surprised
her
yes
madame
she
poured
out
the
liqueur
and
handed
it
to
him
he
set
it
down
by
his
the
fact
is
madame
but
you
know
nothing
about
this
liqueur
no
nothing
what
is
it
her
curiosity
was
roused
by
his
hesitation
his
words
but
still
more
by
a
certain
gravity
which
had
come
into
his
face
well
this
liqueur
comes
from
the
trappist
monastery
of
the
monks
liqueur
she
exclaimed
and
instantly
she
thought
of
mogar
you
do
know
then
ouardi
told
me
we
had
with
us
a
liqueur
made
by
some
this
is
it
and
very
excellent
it
is
i
have
tasted
it
in
but
then
why
did
you
hesitate
to
take
it
here
he
lifted
his
glass
up
to
the
lamp
the
light
shone
on
its
contents
showing
that
the
liquid
was
pale
green
madame
he
said
the
trappists
of
have
a
fine
property
they
grow
every
sort
of
things
but
their
vineyards
are
specially
famous
and
their
wines
bring
in
a
splendid
revenue
this
is
their
only
liqueur
this
louarine
it
too
has
brought
in
a
lot
of
money
to
the
community
but
when
what
they
have
in
stock
at
the
monastery
now
is
exhausted
they
will
never
make
another
franc
by
but
why
not
the
secret
of
its
manufacture
belonged
to
one
monk
only
at
his
death
he
was
to
confide
it
to
another
whom
he
had
and
he
died
suddenly
without
madame
he
didn
t
the
gravity
had
returned
to
the
priest
s
face
and
deepened
there
transforming
it
he
put
the
glass
down
without
touching
it
with
his
lips
then
i
don
t
he
disappeared
from
the
do
you
mean
he
left
it
a
trappist
after
taking
the
final
vows
oh
he
had
been
a
monk
at
for
over
twenty
how
horrible
domini
said
she
looked
at
the
liquid
how
horrible
she
repeated
yes
the
monks
would
have
kept
the
matter
a
secret
but
a
servant
of
the
who
had
taken
no
vow
of
eternal
silence
spoke
and
well
i
know
it
here
in
the
belly
of
the
horrible
she
said
the
word
again
and
as
if
she
felt
its
meaning
more
acutely
each
time
she
spoke
it
after
twenty
years
to
go
she
added
after
a
moment
and
was
there
no
reason
no
no
excuse
no
i
don
t
mean
excuse
but
had
nothing
exceptional
happened
what
exceptional
thing
can
happen
in
a
trappist
monastery
said
the
priest
one
day
is
exactly
like
another
there
and
one
year
exactly
like
was
it
long
ago
no
not
very
long
only
some
months
oh
perhaps
it
may
be
a
year
by
now
but
not
more
poor
fellow
i
suppose
he
was
a
man
who
didn
t
know
himself
madame
and
the
devil
tempted
but
after
twenty
years
said
domini
the
thing
seemed
to
her
almost
incredible
that
man
must
be
in
hell
now
she
added
in
the
hell
a
man
can
make
for
himself
by
his
own
act
oh
here
is
my
androvsky
stood
in
the
tent
door
looking
in
upon
them
with
startled
scrutinising
eyes
he
had
come
over
the
deep
sand
without
noise
neither
domini
nor
the
priest
had
heard
a
footstep
the
priest
got
up
from
his
chair
and
bowed
genially
monsieur
he
said
not
waiting
for
any
introduction
i
am
the
aumonier
of
amara
and
he
paused
in
the
full
flow
of
his
talk
androvsky
s
eyes
had
wandered
from
his
face
to
the
table
upon
which
stood
the
coffee
the
liqueur
and
the
other
things
brought
by
ouardi
it
was
evident
even
to
the
priest
that
his
host
was
not
listening
to
him
there
was
a
moment
s
awkward
pause
then
domini
said
boris
monsieur
l
aumonier
she
did
not
speak
loudly
but
with
an
intention
that
recalled
the
mind
of
her
husband
he
stepped
slowly
into
the
tent
and
held
out
his
hand
in
silence
to
the
priest
as
he
did
so
the
lamplight
fell
full
upon
him
boris
are
you
ill
domini
exclaimed
the
priest
had
taken
androvsky
s
hand
but
with
a
doubtful
air
his
cheerful
and
confident
manner
had
died
away
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
host
shone
with
an
astonishment
which
was
mingled
with
a
sort
of
boyish
glumness
it
was
evident
that
he
felt
that
his
presence
was
unwelcome
i
have
a
headache
androvsky
said
i
that
is
why
i
he
dropped
the
priest
s
hand
he
was
again
looking
towards
the
table
the
sun
was
unusually
fierce
domini
said
do
you
think
yes
yes
he
interrupted
that
s
it
i
must
have
had
a
touch
of
the
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
excuse
me
monsieur
he
said
speaking
to
the
priest
but
not
looking
at
him
i
am
really
feeling
unwell
another
day
he
went
out
of
the
tent
and
disappeared
silently
into
the
darkness
domini
and
the
priest
looked
after
him
then
the
priest
with
an
air
of
embarrassment
took
up
his
hat
from
the
table
his
cigar
had
gone
out
but
he
pulled
at
it
as
if
he
thought
it
was
still
alight
then
took
it
out
of
his
mouth
and
glancing
with
a
naive
regret
at
the
good
things
upon
the
table
his
coffee
the
biscuits
the
white
box
of
said
madame
i
must
be
off
i
ve
a
good
way
to
go
and
it
s
getting
late
if
you
will
allow
me
he
went
to
the
tent
door
and
called
in
a
powerful
voice
belgassem
belgassem
he
paused
then
called
again
belgassem
a
light
travelled
over
the
sand
from
the
farther
tents
of
the
servants
then
the
priest
turned
round
to
domini
and
shook
her
by
the
hand
i
m
very
sorry
she
said
not
trying
to
detain
him
you
must
come
again
my
husband
is
evidently
ill
and
you
must
go
to
him
of
course
of
course
this
sun
is
a
blessing
still
it
brings
fever
sometimes
especially
to
strangers
we
eh
madame
he
laughed
but
the
laugh
had
lost
its
sonorous
ring
we
can
stand
it
it
s
our
friend
but
for
travellers
sometimes
it
s
a
little
bit
too
much
but
now
mind
i
m
a
bit
of
a
doctor
and
if
your
husband
is
no
better
i
might
anyhow
he
looked
again
longingly
at
the
and
the
cigars
if
you
ll
allow
me
i
ll
call
to
know
how
he
thank
you
not
at
all
madame
not
at
all
i
can
set
him
right
in
a
minute
if
it
s
anything
to
do
with
the
sun
in
a
minute
ah
here
s
belgassem
the
soldier
stood
like
a
statue
without
bearing
the
lantern
the
priest
hesitated
he
was
holding
the
cigar
in
his
hand
and
now
he
glanced
at
it
and
then
at
the
a
plaintive
expression
overspread
his
bronzed
and
bearded
face
it
became
almost
piteous
quickly
domini
wait
to
the
table
took
two
cigars
from
the
box
and
came
back
you
must
have
a
cigar
to
smoke
on
the
really
madame
you
are
too
good
but
well
i
rarely
refuse
a
fine
cigar
and
these
upon
my
word
are
he
struck
a
match
on
his
boot
his
demeanour
was
becoming
cheerful
again
domini
gave
the
other
cigar
to
the
soldier
madame
a
demain
then
a
demain
i
trust
your
husband
may
be
able
to
rest
a
demain
a
demain
the
light
moved
away
over
the
dunes
and
dropped
down
towards
the
city
then
domini
hurried
across
the
sand
to
the
as
she
went
she
was
acutely
aware
of
the
many
distant
noises
that
rose
up
in
the
night
to
the
pale
crescent
of
the
young
moon
the
pulsing
of
the
tomtoms
in
the
city
the
faint
screaming
of
the
pipes
that
sounded
almost
like
human
beings
in
distress
the
passionate
barking
of
the
guard
dogs
tied
up
to
the
tents
on
the
where
the
multitudes
of
fires
gleamed
the
sensation
of
being
far
away
and
close
to
the
heart
of
the
desert
deepened
in
her
but
she
felt
now
that
it
was
a
savage
heart
that
there
was
something
terrible
in
the
remoteness
in
the
faint
moonlight
the
tent
cast
black
shadows
upon
the
wintry
whiteness
of
the
sands
that
rose
and
fell
like
waves
of
a
smooth
but
sea
and
the
shadow
of
the
looked
the
blackest
of
them
all
for
she
began
to
feel
as
if
there
was
another
darkness
about
it
than
the
darkness
that
it
cast
upon
the
sand
her
husband
s
face
that
night
as
he
came
in
from
the
dunes
had
been
dark
with
a
shadow
cast
surely
by
his
soul
and
she
did
not
know
what
it
was
in
his
soul
that
sent
forth
the
shadow
boris
she
was
at
the
door
of
the
he
did
not
answer
boris
he
came
in
from
the
farther
tent
that
he
used
as
a
carrying
a
lit
candle
in
his
hand
she
went
up
to
him
with
a
movement
of
swift
ardent
sincerity
you
felt
ill
in
the
city
did
batouch
let
you
come
back
alone
i
preferred
to
be
he
set
down
the
candle
on
the
table
and
moved
so
that
the
light
of
it
did
not
fall
upon
his
face
she
took
his
hands
in
hers
gently
there
was
no
response
in
his
hands
they
remained
in
hers
nervelessly
they
felt
almost
like
dead
things
in
her
hands
but
they
were
not
cold
but
burning
hot
you
have
fever
she
said
she
let
one
of
his
hands
go
and
put
one
of
hers
to
his
forehead
your
forehead
is
burning
and
your
pulses
how
they
are
beating
like
hammers
i
must
don
t
give
me
anything
domini
it
would
be
she
was
silent
there
was
a
sound
of
hopelessness
in
his
voice
that
frightened
her
it
was
like
the
voice
of
a
man
rejecting
remedies
because
he
knew
that
he
was
stricken
with
a
mortal
disease
why
did
that
priest
come
here
he
asked
they
were
both
standing
up
but
now
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
heavily
taking
his
hand
from
hers
merely
to
pay
a
visit
of
at
night
he
spoke
suspiciously
again
she
thought
of
mogar
and
of
how
on
his
return
from
the
dunes
he
had
said
to
her
there
is
a
light
in
the
a
painful
sensation
of
being
surrounded
with
mystery
came
upon
her
it
was
hateful
to
her
strong
and
frank
nature
it
was
like
a
miasma
that
suffocated
her
soul
oh
boris
she
exclaimed
bluntly
why
should
he
not
come
at
night
is
such
a
thing
usual
but
he
was
visiting
the
tents
over
there
of
the
nomads
and
he
had
heard
of
our
arrival
he
knew
it
was
informal
but
as
he
said
in
the
desert
one
forgets
and
and
did
he
ask
for
anything
ask
i
saw
on
the
and
and
there
was
naturally
i
offered
him
he
didn
t
ask
but
boris
how
could
he
after
a
moment
of
silence
he
said
no
of
course
he
shifted
in
his
chair
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
put
his
hands
on
the
arms
of
it
and
continued
what
did
he
talk
about
a
little
about
that
was
all
he
hadn
t
been
here
long
when
you
came
but
he
told
me
one
thing
that
was
horrible
she
added
obedient
to
her
instinct
always
to
tell
the
complete
truth
to
him
even
about
trifles
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
lives
or
their
relation
to
each
other
horrible
androvsky
said
uncrossing
his
legs
and
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
she
sat
down
by
him
they
both
had
their
backs
to
the
light
and
were
in
shadow
what
was
it
about
some
crime
here
oh
no
it
was
about
that
liqueur
you
saw
on
the
androvsky
was
sitting
upon
a
basket
chair
as
she
spoke
it
creaked
under
a
violent
movement
that
he
made
how
could
what
could
there
be
that
was
horrible
connected
with
that
he
asked
speaking
slowly
it
was
made
by
a
monk
a
trappist
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
went
to
the
opening
of
the
tent
what
she
began
thinking
he
was
perhaps
feeling
the
pain
in
his
head
more
severely
i
only
want
to
be
in
the
air
it
s
rather
hot
there
stay
where
you
are
domini
and
well
what
else
he
stepped
out
into
the
sand
and
stood
just
outside
the
tent
in
its
shadow
it
was
invented
by
a
trappist
monk
of
the
monastery
of
who
disappeared
from
the
monastery
he
had
taken
the
final
vows
he
had
been
there
for
over
twenty
he
he
disappeared
did
the
priest
say
where
i
don
t
think
i
am
sure
he
doesn
t
know
but
what
does
it
matter
the
awful
thing
is
that
he
should
leave
the
monastery
after
taking
the
eternal
vows
vows
made
to
after
a
moment
during
which
neither
of
them
spoke
and
androvsky
stood
quite
still
in
the
sand
she
added
poor
man
androvsky
came
a
step
towards
her
then
paused
why
do
you
say
that
domini
i
was
thinking
of
the
agony
he
must
be
enduring
if
he
is
still
agony
of
mind
of
heart
you
i
know
boris
you
can
t
feel
with
me
on
certain
subjects
yet
yet
he
said
boris
she
got
up
and
came
to
the
tent
door
but
not
out
upon
the
sand
i
dare
to
hope
that
some
day
perhaps
she
was
silent
looking
towards
him
with
her
brave
steady
eyes
agony
of
heart
androvsky
said
recurring
to
her
words
you
think
what
you
pity
that
man
then
and
don
t
you
i
what
has
he
to
do
with
us
why
should
we
i
know
but
one
does
sometimes
pity
men
one
never
has
seen
never
will
see
if
one
hears
something
frightful
about
them
perhaps
don
t
smile
boris
perhaps
it
was
seeing
that
liqueur
which
he
had
actually
made
in
the
monastery
when
he
was
at
peace
with
god
perhaps
it
was
seeing
that
that
has
made
me
realise
such
trifles
stir
the
imagination
set
it
working
at
any
rate
she
broke
off
after
a
minute
during
which
he
said
nothing
she
continued
i
believe
the
priest
felt
something
of
the
same
sort
he
could
not
drink
the
liqueur
that
man
had
made
although
he
intended
but
that
might
have
been
for
a
different
reason
androvsky
said
in
a
harsh
voice
priests
have
strange
ideas
they
often
judge
things
cruelly
very
perhaps
they
do
yes
i
can
imagine
that
father
roubier
of
might
though
he
is
a
good
man
and
leads
a
saintly
those
are
sometimes
the
most
cruel
they
do
not
perhaps
not
it
may
be
so
but
this
priest
he
s
not
like
she
thought
of
his
genial
bearded
face
his
expression
when
he
said
we
are
ruffians
of
the
sun
including
himself
with
the
desert
men
his
boisterous
laugh
his
fault
might
be
the
other
which
way
too
great
a
can
a
man
be
too
tolerant
towards
his
said
androvsky
there
was
a
strange
sound
of
emotion
in
his
deep
voice
which
moved
her
it
seemed
to
her
why
she
did
not
know
to
steal
out
of
the
depth
of
something
their
mutual
love
had
created
the
greatest
of
all
tolerance
is

in
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
tent

her
in
his
arms
with
passion
laid
his
lips
on
hers
with
passion
hot
burning
force
and

a

was

whispered
through
tears
that
rushed
from
her
eyes
stirred
from
their
by
his
sudden
outburst
of
love
for
her

released
her
as
abruptly
as
he
had
taken
her
in
his
arms
turned
and
went
out
into
the
desert
chapter
xxiv
true
to
his
promise
on
the
following
day
the
priest
called
to
inquire
after
androvsky
s
health
he
happened
to
come
just
before
was
ready
and
met
androvsky
on
the
sand
before
the
tent
door
it
s
not
fever
then
monsieur
he
said
after
they
had
shaken
hands
no
no
androvsky
replied
i
am
quite
well
this
the
priest
looked
at
him
closely
with
an
unembarrassed
scrutiny
have
you
been
long
in
the
desert
monsieur
he
asked
some
the
heat
has
tired
you
i
know
the
look
i
assure
you
monsieur
that
i
am
accustomed
to
heat
i
have
lived
in
north
africa
all
my
indeed
and
yet
by
your
appearance
i
should
certainly
suppose
that
you
needed
a
change
from
the
desert
the
air
of
the
sahara
is
magnificent
but
there
are
people
i
am
not
one
of
them
androvsky
said
abruptly
i
have
never
felt
so
strong
physically
as
since
i
have
lived
in
the
the
priest
still
looked
at
him
closely
but
said
nothing
further
on
the
subject
of
health
indeed
almost
immediately
his
attention
was
distracted
by
the
apparition
of
ouardi
bearing
dishes
from
the
cook
s
tent
i
am
afraid
i
have
called
at
a
very
unorthodox
time
he
remarked
looking
at
his
watch
but
the
fact
is
that
here
in
amara
we
i
hope
you
will
stay
to
androvsky
said
it
is
very
good
of
you
if
you
are
certain
that
i
shall
not
put
you
please
i
will
then
with
he
moved
his
lips
expectantly
as
if
only
a
sense
of
politeness
prevented
him
from
smacking
them
androvsky
went
towards
the
where
domini
who
had
been
into
the
city
was
washing
her
hands
the
priest
has
called
he
said
i
have
asked
him
to
she
looked
at
him
with
frank
astonishment
in
her
dark
eyes
you
boris
yes
i
why
not
i
don
t
know
but
generally
you
hate
he
seems
a
good
sort
of
she
still
looked
at
him
with
some
surprise
even
with
curiosity
have
you
taken
a
fancy
to
a
priest
she
asked
smiling
why
not
this
man
is
very
different
from
father
roubier
more
father
beret
is
very
human
i
think
she
answered
she
was
still
smiling
it
had
just
occurred
to
her
that
the
priest
had
timed
his
visit
with
some
forethought
i
am
coming
she
added
a
sudden
cheerfulness
had
taken
possession
of
her
all
the
morning
she
had
been
feeling
grave
even
almost
apprehensive
after
a
bad
night
when
her
husband
had
abruptly
left
her
and
gone
away
into
the
darkness
she
had
been
overtaken
by
a
sudden
wave
of
acute
depression
she
had
felt
more
painfully
than
ever
before
the
mental
separation
which
existed
between
them
despite
their
deep
love
and
a
passionate
but
almost
hopeless
longing
had
filled
her
heart
that
in
all
things
they
might
be
one
not
only
in
love
of
each
other
but
in
love
of
god
when
androvsky
had
taken
his
arms
from
her
she
had
seemed
to
feel
herself
released
by
a
great
despair
and
this
certainty
for
as
he
vanished
into
the
darkness
she
was
no
more
in
doubt
that
his
love
for
her
left
room
within
his
heart
for
such
an
agony
had
for
a
moment
brought
her
soul
to
the
dust
she
had
been
overwhelmed
by
a
sensation
that
instead
of
being
close
together
they
were
far
apart
almost
strangers
and
a
great
bitterness
had
entered
into
her
it
was
accompanied
by
a
desire
for
action
she
longed
to
follow
androvsky
to
lay
her
hand
on
his
arm
to
stop
him
in
the
sand
and
force
him
to
confide
in
her
for
the
first
time
the
idea
that
he
was
keeping
something
from
her
a
sorrow
almost
maddened
her
even
made
her
feel
jealous
the
fact
that
she
divined
what
that
sorrow
was
or
believed
she
divined
it
did
not
help
her
just
then
she
waited
a
long
while
but
androvsky
did
not
return
and
at
last
she
prayed
and
went
to
bed
but
her
prayers
were
feeble
disjointed
and
sleep
did
not
come
to
her
for
her
mind
was
travelling
with
this
man
who
loved
her
and
who
yet
was
out
there
alone
in
the
night
who
was
deliberately
separating
himself
from
her
towards
dawn
when
he
stole
into
the
tent
she
was
still
awake
but
she
did
not
speak
or
give
any
sign
of
consciousness
although
she
was
hot
with
the
fierce
desire
to
spring
up
to
throw
her
arms
round
him
to
draw
his
head
down
upon
her
heart
and
say
i
have
given
myself
body
heart
and
soul
to
you
give
yourself
to
me
give
me
the
thing
you
are
keeping
back
your
sorrow
till
i
have
that
i
have
not
all
of
you
and
till
i
have
all
of
you
i
am
in
it
was
a
mad
impulse
she
resisted
it
and
lay
quite
still
and
when
he
lay
down
and
was
quiet
she
slept
at
length
now
as
she
heard
him
speak
in
the
sunshine
and
knew
that
he
had
offered
hospitality
to
the
comfortable
priest
her
heart
suddenly
felt
lighter
she
scarcely
knew
why
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
been
a
little
morbid
and
that
the
cloud
which
had
settled
about
her
was
lifted
revealing
the
blue
at
she
was
even
more
reassured
her
husband
seemed
to
get
on
with
the
priest
better
than
she
had
ever
seen
him
get
on
with
anybody
he
began
by
making
an
effort
to
be
agreeable
that
was
obvious
to
her
but
presently
he
was
agreeable
without
effort
the
simple
geniality
and
lack
of
in
father
beret
evidently
set
him
at
his
ease
once
or
twice
she
saw
him
look
at
his
guest
with
an
earnest
scrutiny
that
puzzled
her
but
he
talked
far
more
than
usual
and
with
greater
animation
discussing
the
arabs
and
listening
to
the
priest
s
account
of
the
curiosities
of
life
in
amara
when
at
length
father
beret
rose
to
go
androvsky
said
he
would
accompany
him
a
little
way
and
they
went
off
together
evidently
on
the
best
of
terms
she
was
delighted
and
surprised
she
had
been
right
then
it
was
time
that
androvsky
was
subjected
to
another
influence
than
that
of
the
unpeopled
wastes
it
was
time
that
he
came
into
contact
with
men
whose
minds
were
more
akin
to
his
than
the
minds
of
the
arabs
who
had
been
their
only
companions
she
began
to
imagine
him
with
her
in
civilised
places
to
be
able
to
imagine
him
and
she
was
glad
they
had
come
to
amara
and
confirmed
in
her
resolve
to
stay
on
there
she
even
began
to
wish
that
the
french
officers
quartered
there
few
in
number
some
five
or
six
would
find
them
in
the
sand
and
that
androvsky
would
offer
them
hospitality
it
occurred
to
her
that
it
was
not
quite
wholesome
for
a
man
to
live
in
isolation
from
his
even
with
the
woman
he
loved
and
she
determined
that
she
would
not
be
selfish
in
her
love
that
she
would
think
for
androvsky
act
for
him
even
against
her
own
inclination
perhaps
his
idea
of
life
in
an
oasis
apart
from
europeans
was
one
she
ought
to
combat
though
it
fascinated
her
perhaps
it
would
be
stronger
more
sane
to
face
a
more
ordinary
less
dreamy
life
in
which
they
would
meet
with
people
in
which
they
would
inevitably
find
themselves
confronted
with
duties
she
felt
powerful
enough
in
that
moment
to
do
anything
that
would
make
for
androvsky
s
welfare
of
soul
his
body
was
strong
and
at
ease
she
thought
of
him
going
away
with
the
priest
in
friendly
conversation
how
splendid
it
would
be
if
she
could
feel
some
day
that
the
health
of
his
soul
accorded
completely
with
that
of
his
body
batouch
she
called
almost
gaily
batouch
appeared
languidly
smoking
a
cigarette
and
with
a
large
flower
tied
to
a
twig
protending
from
behind
his
ear
saddle
the
horses
monsieur
has
gone
with
the
pere
beret
i
shall
take
a
ride
just
a
short
ride
round
the
camp
over
there
in
at
the
city
gate
through
the
and
home
you
will
come
with
batouch
threw
away
his
cigarette
with
energy
poet
though
he
was
all
the
arab
blood
in
him
responded
to
the
thought
of
a
gallop
over
the
sands
within
a
few
minutes
they
were
off
when
she
was
in
the
saddle
it
was
at
all
times
difficult
for
domini
to
be
sad
or
even
pensive
she
had
a
native
passion
for
a
good
horse
and
riding
was
one
of
the
joys
and
almost
the
keenest
of
her
life
she
felt
powerful
when
she
had
a
spirited
fiery
animal
under
her
and
the
wide
spaces
of
the
desert
summoned
speed
as
they
summoned
dreams
she
and
batouch
went
away
at
a
rapid
pace
circled
round
the
arab
cemetery
made
a
detour
towards
the
south
and
then
cantered
into
the
midst
of
the
camps
of
the
ouled
nails
it
was
the
hour
of
the
siesta
only
a
few
people
were
stirring
coming
and
going
over
the
dunes
to
and
from
the
city
on
languid
errands
for
the
women
of
the
tents
who
reclined
in
the
shade
of
their
brushwood
arbours
upon
filthy
cushions
and
heaps
of
rags
smoking
cigarettes
playing
cards
with
arab
and
negro
admirers
or
staring
into
vacancy
beneath
their
heavy
eyebrows
as
they
listened
to
the
sound
of
music
played
upon
long
pipes
of
reed
no
dogs
barked
in
their
camp
the
only
guardians
were
old
women
whose
sandy
faces
were
scored
with
innumerable
wrinkles
and
whose
withered
hands
drooped
under
their
loads
of
barbaric
rings
and
bracelets
batouch
would
evidently
have
liked
to
dismount
here
like
all
arabs
he
was
fascinated
by
the
sight
of
these
idols
of
the
waste
whose
painted
faces
called
to
the
surface
the
fluid
poetry
within
him
but
domini
rode
on
descending
towards
the
city
gate
by
which
she
had
first
entered
amara
the
priest
s
house
was
there
and
androvsky
was
with
the
priest
she
hoped
he
had
perhaps
gone
in
to
return
the
visit
paid
to
them
as
she
rode
into
the
city
she
glanced
at
the
house
the
door
was
open
and
she
saw
the
gay
rugs
in
the
little
hall
she
had
a
strong
inclination
to
stop
and
ask
if
her
husband
were
there
he
might
mount
batouch
s
horse
and
accompany
her
home
batouch
she
said
will
you
ask
if
monsieur
androvsky
is
with
pere
beret
i
think
she
stopped
speaking
she
had
just
seen
her
husband
s
face
pass
across
the
of
the
room
on
the
side
of
the
hall
door
she
could
not
see
it
very
well
the
arcade
built
out
beyond
the
house
cast
a
deep
shade
within
and
in
this
shade
the
face
had
flitted
like
a
shadow
batouch
had
sprung
from
his
horse
but
the
sight
of
the
shadowy
face
had
changed
her
mind
she
resolved
not
to
interrupt
the
two
men
long
ago
at
she
had
asked
androvsky
to
call
upon
a
priest
she
remembered
the
sequel
to
that
visit
this
time
androvsky
had
gone
of
his
own
will
if
he
liked
this
priest
if
they
became
friends
perhaps
she
remembered
her
vision
in
the
her
feeling
that
when
she
drew
near
amara
she
was
drawing
near
to
the
heart
of
the
desert
if
she
should
see
androvsky
praying
here
yet
father
beret
hardly
seemed
a
man
likely
to
influence
her
husband
or
anyone
with
a
strong
and
serious
personality
he
was
surely
too
fond
of
the
things
of
this
world
too
obviously
a
lover
and
cherisher
of
the
body
nevertheless
there
was
something
attractive
in
him
a
kindness
a
geniality
in
trouble
he
would
be
sympathetic
certainly
her
husband
must
have
taken
a
liking
to
him
and
the
chances
of
life
and
the
influences
of
destiny
were
strange
and
not
to
be
foreseen
no
batouch
she
said
we
won
t
but
madame
he
cried
monsieur
is
in
there
i
saw
his
face
at
the
never
mind
we
won
t
disturb
them
i
daresay
they
have
something
to
talk
they
cantered
on
towards
the
it
was
not
and
the
town
like
the
camp
of
the
ouled
nails
was
almost
deserted
as
she
rode
up
the
hill
towards
the
place
of
the
fountain
however
she
saw
two
arabs
followed
by
a
servant
slowly
strolling
towards
her
from
the
doorway
of
the
bureau
arabe
one
who
was
very
tall
was
dressed
in
green
and
carried
a
long
staff
from
which
hung
green
ribbons
the
other
wore
a
more
ordinary
costume
of
white
with
a
white
burnous
and
a
turban
spangled
with
gold
madame
said
batouch
do
you
see
the
arab
dressed
in
green
he
spoke
in
an
almost
awestruck
voice
yes
who
is
he
the
great
marabout
who
lives
at
the
name
struck
upon
domini
s
ear
with
a
strange
familiarity
but
that
s
where
count
anteoni
went
when
he
rode
away
from
that
yes
is
it
far
from
amara
two
hours
ride
across
the
but
then
count
anteoni
may
be
near
us
after
he
left
he
wrote
to
me
and
gave
me
his
address
at
the
marabout
s
if
he
is
still
with
the
marabout
they
were
close
to
the
fountain
now
and
the
marabout
and
his
companion
were
coming
straight
towards
them
if
madame
will
allow
me
i
will
salute
the
marabout
said
batouch
he
sprang
off
his
horse
immediately
tied
it
up
to
the
railing
of
the
fountain
and
went
respectfully
towards
the
approaching
potentate
to
kiss
his
hand
domini
saw
the
marabout
stop
and
batouch
bend
down
then
lift
himself
up
and
suddenly
move
back
as
if
in
surprise
the
arab
who
was
with
the
marabout
seemed
also
surprised
he
held
out
his
hand
to
batouch
who
took
it
kissed
it
then
kissed
his
own
hand
and
turning
pointed
towards
domini
the
arab
spoke
a
word
to
the
marabout
then
left
him
and
came
rapidly
forward
to
the
fountain
as
he
drew
close
to
her
she
saw
a
face
browned
by
the
sun
a
very
small
pointed
beard
a
pair
of
intensely
bright
eyes
surrounded
by
wrinkles
these
eyes
held
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
knew
them
that
she
had
often
looked
into
them
and
seen
their
changing
expressions
suddenly
she
exclaimed
count
anteoni
yes
it
is
i
he
held
out
his
hand
and
clasped
hers
so
you
have
started
upon
your
desert
journey
he
added
looking
closely
at
her
as
he
had
often
looked
in
the
garden
and
as
i
ventured
to
advise
that
last
time
do
you
remember
she
recollected
his
words
no
she
replied
and
there
was
a
warmth
of
joy
almost
of
pride
in
her
voice
i
am
not
count
anteoni
was
standing
with
one
hand
on
her
horse
s
neck
as
she
spoke
his
hand
dropped
down
i
have
been
away
from
he
said
slowly
the
marabout
and
i
have
been
travelling
in
the
south
and
only
returned
yesterday
i
have
heard
no
news
for
a
long
time
from
but
i
know
you
are
madame
yes
she
answered
i
am
madame
there
was
a
silence
between
them
in
it
she
heard
the
dripping
water
in
the
fountain
at
last
count
anteoni
spoke
again
it
was
written
he
said
quietly
it
was
written
in
the
she
thought
of
the
and
was
silent
an
oppression
of
spirit
had
suddenly
come
upon
her
it
seemed
to
her
connected
with
something
physical
something
obscure
unusual
such
as
she
had
never
felt
before
it
was
she
thought
as
if
her
body
at
that
moment
became
more
alive
than
it
had
ever
been
and
as
if
that
increase
of
life
within
her
gave
to
her
a
peculiar
uneasiness
she
was
startled
she
even
felt
alarmed
as
at
the
faint
approach
of
something
strange
of
something
that
was
going
to
alter
her
life
she
did
not
know
at
all
what
it
was
for
the
moment
a
sense
of
confusion
and
of
pain
beset
her
and
she
was
scarcely
aware
with
whom
she
was
or
where
the
sensation
passed
and
she
recovered
herself
and
met
count
anteoni
s
eyes
quietly
yes
she
answered
all
that
has
happened
to
me
here
in
africa
was
written
in
the
sand
and
in
you
are
thinking
of
the
i
where
are
you
living
close
by
on
the
beyond
the
city
where
you
can
see
the
fires
lit
at
night
and
hear
the
sound
of
the
music
of
africa
as
he
yes
as
he
again
the
overwhelming
sense
of
some
strange
and
formidable
approach
came
over
her
but
this
time
she
fought
it
resolutely
will
you
come
and
see
me
she
said
she
had
meant
to
say
us
but
did
not
say
it
if
you
will
allow
when
i
she
heard
the
odd
upward
grating
in
his
voice
which
she
remembered
so
well
may
i
come
now
if
you
are
riding
to
the
tents
please
i
will
explain
to
the
marabout
and
follow
but
the
way
shall
batouch
no
it
is
not
she
rode
away
when
she
reached
the
camp
she
found
that
androvsky
had
not
yet
returned
and
she
was
glad
she
wanted
to
talk
to
count
anteoni
alone
within
a
few
minutes
she
saw
him
coming
towards
the
tent
his
beard
and
his
arab
dress
so
altered
him
that
at
a
short
distance
she
could
not
recognise
him
could
only
guess
that
it
was
he
but
directly
he
was
near
and
she
saw
his
eyes
she
forgot
that
he
was
altered
and
felt
that
she
was
with
her
kind
and
whimsical
host
of
the
garden
my
husband
is
in
the
city
she
said
with
the
she
saw
an
expression
of
surprise
flit
over
count
anteoni
s
face
it
went
away
instantly
pere
beret
he
said
he
is
a
cheerful
creature
and
very
good
to
the
they
sat
down
just
inside
the
shadow
of
the
tent
before
the
door
and
he
looked
out
quietly
towards
the
city
yes
this
is
the
place
he
said
she
knew
that
he
was
alluding
to
the
vision
of
the
and
said
so
did
you
believe
at
the
time
that
what
he
said
would
come
true
she
asked
how
could
i
am
i
a
child
he
spoke
with
gentle
irony
but
she
felt
he
was
playing
with
her
can
not
a
man
believe
such
things
he
did
not
answer
her
but
said
my
fate
has
come
to
pass
do
you
not
care
to
know
what
it
is
yes
do
tell
she
spoke
earnestly
she
felt
a
change
in
him
a
great
change
which
as
yet
she
did
not
understand
fully
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
a
man
in
doubt
and
was
now
a
man
no
longer
in
doubt
as
if
he
had
arrived
at
some
goal
and
was
more
at
peace
with
himself
than
he
had
been
i
have
become
a
mohammedan
he
said
simply
a
mohammedan
she
repeated
the
words
as
a
person
repeats
words
in
surprise
but
her
voice
did
not
sound
surprised
you
wonder
he
asked
after
a
moment
she
answered
no
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
but
i
am
not
surprised
now
you
have
told
me
it
seems
to
explain
you
much
that
i
noticed
in
you
wondered
about
in
she
looked
at
him
steadily
but
without
curiosity
i
feel
that
you
are
happy
yes
i
am
happy
the
world
i
used
to
know
my
world
and
yours
would
laugh
at
me
would
say
that
i
was
crazy
that
it
was
a
whim
that
i
wished
for
a
new
sensation
simply
it
had
to
be
for
years
i
have
been
tending
towards
it
who
knows
why
who
knows
what
obscure
influences
have
been
at
work
in
me
whether
there
is
not
perhaps
far
back
some
faint
strain
of
arab
blood
mingled
with
the
sicilian
blood
in
my
veins
i
can
not
understand
why
what
i
can
understand
is
that
at
last
i
have
fulfilled
my
destiny
after
years
of
unrest
i
am
suddenly
and
completely
at
peace
it
is
a
magical
sensation
i
have
been
wandering
all
my
life
and
have
come
upon
the
open
door
of
my
he
spoke
very
quietly
but
she
heard
the
joy
in
his
voice
i
remember
you
saying
i
like
to
see
men
praying
in
the
yes
when
i
looked
at
them
i
was
longing
to
be
one
of
them
for
years
from
my
garden
wall
i
watched
them
with
a
passion
of
envy
with
bitterness
almost
with
hatred
sometimes
they
had
something
i
had
not
something
that
set
them
above
me
something
that
made
their
lives
plain
through
any
complication
and
that
gave
to
death
a
meaning
like
the
meaning
at
the
close
of
a
great
story
that
is
going
to
have
a
sequel
they
had
faith
and
it
was
difficult
not
to
hate
them
but
now
i
am
one
of
them
i
can
pray
in
the
that
was
why
you
left
yes
i
had
long
been
wishing
to
become
a
mohammedan
i
came
here
to
be
with
the
marabout
to
enter
more
fully
into
certain
questions
to
see
if
i
had
any
lingering
and
you
have
none
she
looked
at
his
bright
eyes
and
sighed
thinking
of
her
husband
you
will
go
back
to
she
asked
i
don
t
think
so
i
am
inclined
to
go
farther
into
the
desert
farther
among
the
people
of
my
own
faith
i
don
t
want
to
be
surrounded
by
french
some
day
perhaps
i
may
return
but
at
present
everything
draws
me
onward
tell
me
he
dropped
the
earnest
tone
in
which
he
had
been
speaking
and
she
heard
once
more
the
easy
man
of
the
world
do
you
think
me
a
eccentric
no
you
look
at
me
very
gravely
even
i
was
thinking
of
the
men
who
can
not
pray
she
said
even
in
the
they
should
not
come
into
the
garden
of
allah
don
t
you
remember
that
day
by
the
garden
wall
when
he
suddenly
checked
himself
forgive
me
he
said
simply
and
now
tell
me
about
yourself
you
never
wrote
that
you
were
going
to
be
i
knew
you
would
know
it
in
time
when
we
met
and
you
knew
we
should
meet
again
did
not
you
he
nodded
in
the
heart
of
the
desert
and
you
where
are
you
going
you
are
not
returning
to
civilisation
i
don
t
know
i
have
no
plans
i
want
to
do
what
my
husband
and
he
he
loves
the
desert
he
has
suggested
our
buying
an
oasis
and
setting
up
as
date
merchants
what
do
you
think
of
the
idea
she
spoke
with
a
smile
but
her
eyes
were
serious
even
sad
i
can
not
judge
for
others
he
answered
when
he
got
up
to
go
he
held
her
hand
fast
for
a
moment
may
i
speak
what
is
in
my
heart
he
asked
yes
i
feel
as
if
what
i
have
told
you
about
myself
about
my
having
come
to
the
open
door
of
a
home
i
had
long
been
wearily
seeking
had
made
you
sad
is
it
so
yes
she
answered
frankly
can
you
tell
me
why
it
has
made
me
realise
more
sharply
than
perhaps
i
did
before
what
must
be
the
misery
of
those
who
are
still
there
was
in
her
voice
a
sound
as
if
she
suppressed
a
sob
hope
for
them
remembering
my
many
years
of
yes
will
you
come
again
you
are
here
for
long
some
days
i
whenever
you
ask
me
i
will
i
want
you
and
my
husband
to
meet
again
i
want
that
very
she
spoke
with
a
pressure
of
eagerness
send
for
me
and
i
will
come
at
any
i
will
send
when
he
was
gone
domini
sat
in
the
shadow
of
the
tent
from
where
she
was
she
could
see
the
arab
cemetery
at
a
little
distance
a
quantity
of
stones
half
drowned
in
the
sand
an
old
arab
was
wandering
there
alone
praying
for
the
dead
in
a
loud
persistent
voice
sometimes
he
paused
by
a
grave
bowed
himself
in
prayer
then
rose
and
walked
on
again
his
voice
was
never
silent
the
sound
of
it
was
plaintive
and
monotonous
domini
listened
to
it
and
thought
of
homeless
men
of
those
who
had
lived
and
died
without
ever
coming
to
that
open
door
through
which
count
anteoni
had
entered
his
words
and
the
changed
look
in
his
face
had
made
a
deep
impression
upon
her
she
realised
that
in
the
garden
when
they
were
together
his
eyes
even
when
they
twinkled
with
the
slightly
ironical
humour
peculiar
to
him
had
always
held
a
shadow
now
that
shadow
was
lifted
out
of
them
how
deep
was
the
shadow
in
her
husband
s
eyes
how
deep
had
it
been
in
the
eyes
of
her
father
he
had
died
with
that
terrible
darkness
in
his
eyes
and
in
his
soul
if
her
husband
were
to
die
thus
a
terror
came
upon
her
she
looked
out
at
the
stones
in
the
sand
and
imagined
herself
there
as
the
old
arab
was
praying
for
androvsky
buried
there
hidden
from
her
on
earth
for
ever
and
suddenly
she
felt
i
can
not
wait
i
must
her
faith
was
deep
and
strong
nothing
could
shake
it
but
might
it
not
shake
the
doubt
from
another
s
soul
as
a
great
pure
wind
shakes
leaves
that
are
dead
from
a
tree
that
will
blossom
with
the
spring
hitherto
a
sense
of
intense
delicacy
had
prevented
her
from
ever
trying
to
draw
near
definitely
to
her
husband
s
sadness
but
her
interview
with
count
anteoni
and
the
sound
of
this
voice
praying
praying
for
the
dead
men
in
the
sand
stirred
her
to
an
almost
fierce
resolution
she
had
given
herself
to
androvsky
he
had
given
himself
to
her
they
were
one
she
had
a
right
to
draw
near
to
his
pain
if
by
so
doing
there
was
a
chance
that
she
might
bring
balm
to
it
she
had
a
right
to
look
closer
into
his
eyes
if
hers
full
of
faith
could
lift
the
shadow
from
them
she
leaned
back
in
the
darkness
of
the
tent
the
old
arab
had
wandered
further
on
among
the
graves
his
voice
was
faint
in
the
sand
faint
and
surely
piteous
as
if
even
while
he
prayed
he
felt
that
his
prayers
were
useless
that
the
fate
of
the
dead
was
pronounced
beyond
recall
domini
listened
to
him
no
more
she
was
praying
for
the
living
as
she
had
never
prayed
before
and
her
prayer
was
the
prelude
not
to
patience
but
to
action
it
was
as
if
her
conversation
with
count
anteoni
had
set
a
torch
to
something
in
her
soul
something
that
gave
out
a
great
flame
a
flame
that
could
surely
burn
up
the
sorrow
the
fear
the
secret
torture
in
her
husband
s
soul
all
the
strength
of
her
character
had
been
roused
by
the
sight
of
the
peace
she
desired
for
the
man
she
loved
enthroned
in
the
heart
of
this
other
man
who
was
only
her
friend
the
voice
of
the
old
arab
died
away
in
the
distance
but
before
it
died
away
domini
had
ceased
from
hearing
it
she
heard
only
a
voice
within
her
which
said
to
her
if
you
really
love
be
fearless
attack
this
sorrow
which
stands
like
a
figure
of
death
between
you
and
your
husband
drive
it
away
you
have
a
weapon
faith
use
it
seemed
to
her
then
that
through
all
their
intercourse
she
had
been
a
coward
in
her
love
and
she
resolved
that
she
would
be
a
coward
no
longer
chapter
xxv
domini
had
said
to
herself
that
she
would
speak
to
her
husband
that
night
she
was
resolved
not
to
hesitate
not
to
be
influenced
from
her
purpose
by
anything
yet
she
knew
that
a
great
difficulty
would
stand
in
her
way
the
difficulty
of
androvsky
s
intense
almost
passionate
reserve
this
reserve
was
the
dominant
characteristic
in
his
nature
she
thought
of
it
sometimes
as
a
wall
of
fire
that
he
had
set
round
about
the
secret
places
of
his
soul
to
protect
them
even
from
her
eyes
perhaps
it
was
strange
that
she
a
woman
of
a
singularly
frank
temperament
should
be
attracted
by
reserve
in
another
yet
she
knew
that
she
was
so
attracted
by
the
reserve
of
her
husband
its
existence
hinted
to
her
depths
in
him
which
perhaps
some
day
she
might
sound
she
alone
strength
which
was
hidden
for
her
some
day
to
prove
now
alone
with
her
purpose
she
thought
of
this
reserve
would
she
be
able
to
break
it
down
with
her
love
for
an
instant
she
felt
as
if
she
were
about
to
enter
upon
a
contest
with
her
husband
but
she
did
not
coldly
tell
over
her
armoury
and
select
weapons
there
was
a
heat
of
purpose
within
her
that
beckoned
her
to
the
unthinking
to
the
reckless
way
that
told
her
to
be
and
to
trust
to
the
moment
for
the
method
when
androvsky
returned
to
the
camp
it
was
towards
evening
a
lemon
light
was
falling
over
the
great
white
spaces
of
the
sand
upon
their
little
round
hills
the
arab
villages
glowed
mysteriously
many
horsemen
were
riding
forth
from
the
city
to
take
the
cool
of
the
approaching
night
from
the
desert
the
caravans
were
coming
in
the
nomad
children
played
at
cora
before
the
tents
calling
shrilly
to
each
other
through
the
light
silence
that
floated
airily
away
into
the
vast
distances
that
breathed
out
the
spirit
of
a
pale
eternity
despite
the
heat
there
was
an
almost
wintry
romance
in
this
strange
land
of
white
sands
and
yellow
radiance
an
ethereal
melancholy
that
stole
with
the
twilight
noiselessly
towards
the
tents
as
androvsky
approached
domini
saw
that
he
had
lost
the
energy
which
had
delighted
her
at
he
walked
towards
her
slowly
with
his
head
bent
down
his
face
was
grave
even
sad
though
when
he
saw
her
waiting
for
him
he
smiled
you
have
been
all
this
time
with
the
priest
she
said
nearly
all
i
walked
for
a
little
while
in
the
city
and
you
i
rode
out
and
met
a
a
friend
he
said
as
if
startled
yes
from
count
anteoni
he
has
been
here
to
pay
me
a
she
pulled
forward
a
for
him
he
sank
into
it
heavily
count
anteoni
here
he
said
slowly
what
is
he
doing
here
he
is
with
the
marabout
at
and
boris
he
has
become
a
he
lifted
his
head
with
a
jerk
and
stared
at
her
in
silence
you
are
surprised
a
mohammedan
count
anteoni
yes
do
you
know
when
he
told
me
i
felt
almost
as
if
i
had
been
expecting
but
is
he
changed
then
is
he
he
stopped
his
voice
had
sounded
to
her
bitter
almost
fierce
yes
boris
he
is
changed
have
you
ever
seen
anyone
who
was
lost
and
the
same
person
walking
along
the
road
home
well
that
is
count
they
said
no
more
for
some
minutes
androvsky
was
the
first
to
speak
again
you
told
him
he
asked
about
ourselves
i
told
what
did
he
say
he
had
expected
it
when
we
ask
him
he
is
coming
here
again
to
see
us
both
androvsky
got
up
from
his
chair
his
face
was
troubled
standing
before
domini
he
said
count
anteoni
is
happy
then
now
that
he
now
that
he
has
joined
this
religion
very
and
you
a
catholic
what
do
you
think
i
think
that
since
that
is
his
honest
belief
it
is
a
blessed
thing
for
he
said
no
more
but
went
towards
the
in
the
evening
when
they
were
dining
he
said
to
her
domini
i
am
going
to
leave
you
again
for
a
short
he
saw
a
look
of
keen
regret
come
into
her
face
and
added
quickly
at
nine
i
have
promised
to
go
to
see
the
priest
he
he
is
rather
lonely
here
he
wants
me
to
come
do
you
mind
no
no
i
am
glad
very
glad
have
you
finished
let
us
take
a
rug
and
go
out
a
little
way
in
the
sand
that
way
towards
the
cemetery
it
is
quiet
there
at
yes
i
will
get
a
he
went
to
fetch
it
threw
it
over
his
arm
and
they
set
out
together
she
had
meant
the
arab
cemetery
but
when
they
reached
it
they
found
two
or
three
nomads
wandering
there
let
us
go
on
she
said
they
went
on
and
came
to
the
french
cemetery
which
was
surrounded
by
a
rough
hedge
of
brushwood
in
which
there
were
gaps
here
and
there
through
one
of
these
gaps
they
entered
it
spread
out
the
rug
and
lay
down
on
the
sand
the
night
was
still
and
silence
brooded
here
faintly
they
saw
the
graves
of
the
exiles
who
had
died
here
and
been
given
to
the
sand
where
in
summer
vipers
glided
to
and
fro
and
the
pariah
dogs
wandered
stealthily
seeking
food
to
still
the
desires
in
their
starving
bodies
they
were
mostly
very
simple
but
close
to
domini
and
androvsky
was
one
of
white
marble
in
the
form
of
a
broken
column
hung
with
wreaths
of
everlasting
flowers
and
engraved
with
these
words
ici
repose
jean
baptiste
fabriani
pour
when
they
lay
down
they
both
looked
at
this
grave
as
if
moved
by
a
simultaneous
impulse
and
read
the
words
priez
pour
lui
domini
said
in
a
low
voice
she
put
out
her
hand
and
took
hold
of
her
husband
s
and
pressed
it
down
on
the
sand
do
you
remember
that
first
night
boris
she
said
at
arba
when
you
took
my
hand
in
yours
and
laid
it
against
the
desert
as
against
a
heart
yes
domini
i
that
night
we
were
one
weren
t
we
yes
were
we
she
was
almost
whispering
in
the
night
were
we
truly
one
why
do
you
truly
one
you
say
yes
one
in
soul
that
is
the
great
union
greater
than
the
union
of
our
bodies
were
we
one
in
soul
are
we
now
domini
why
do
you
ask
me
such
questions
do
you
doubt
my
love
no
but
i
do
ask
you
won
t
you
answer
me
he
was
silent
his
hand
lay
in
hers
but
did
not
press
it
boris
she
spoke
the
cruel
words
very
quietly
we
are
not
truly
one
in
soul
we
have
never
been
i
know
he
said
nothing
shall
we
ever
be
think
if
one
of
us
were
to
die
and
the
other
the
one
who
was
left
were
left
with
the
knowledge
that
in
our
love
even
ours
there
had
always
been
separation
could
you
bear
that
could
i
bear
it
domini
why
do
you
speak
like
this
we
are
one
you
have
all
my
love
you
are
everything
to
and
yet
you
are
sad
and
you
try
to
hide
your
sadness
your
misery
from
me
can
you
not
give
it
me
i
want
it
more
than
i
want
anything
on
earth
i
want
it
i
must
have
it
and
i
dare
to
ask
for
it
because
i
know
how
deeply
you
love
me
and
that
you
could
never
love
i
never
have
loved
another
he
said
i
was
the
very
the
very
first
when
we
married
although
i
was
a
man
i
was
as
you
she
bent
down
her
head
and
laid
her
lips
on
his
hand
that
was
in
hers
then
make
our
union
perfect
as
no
other
union
on
earth
has
ever
been
give
me
your
sorrow
boris
i
know
what
it
how
can
you
can
not
know
he
said
in
a
broken
voice
yes
love
is
a
diviner
the
only
true
diviner
i
told
you
once
what
it
was
but
i
want
you
to
tell
me
nothing
that
we
take
is
beautiful
to
us
only
what
we
are
i
can
not
he
said
he
tried
to
take
his
hand
from
hers
but
she
held
it
fast
and
she
felt
as
if
she
were
holding
the
wall
of
fire
with
which
he
surrounded
the
secret
places
of
his
soul
boris
when
i
talked
to
count
anteoni
i
felt
that
i
had
been
a
coward
with
you
i
had
seen
you
suffer
and
i
had
not
dared
to
draw
near
to
your
suffering
i
have
been
afraid
of
you
think
of
yes
i
have
been
afraid
of
you
of
your
reserve
when
you
withdrew
from
me
i
never
followed
you
if
i
had
perhaps
i
could
have
done
something
for
domini
do
not
speak
like
this
our
love
is
happy
leave
it
as
it
i
can
t
i
will
not
boris
count
anteoni
has
found
a
home
but
you
are
wandering
i
can
t
bear
that
i
can
t
bear
it
it
is
as
if
i
were
sitting
in
the
house
warm
safe
and
you
were
out
in
the
storm
it
tortures
me
it
almost
makes
me
hate
my
own
androvsky
shivered
he
took
his
hand
forcibly
from
domini
s
i
have
almost
hated
it
too
he
said
passionately
i
have
hated
it
i
m
a
i
m
his
voice
failed
he
bent
forward
and
took
domini
s
face
between
his
hands
and
yet
there
are
times
when
i
can
bless
what
i
have
hated
i
do
bless
it
now
i
i
love
your
safety
you
at
least
you
are
you
must
share
it
i
will
make
you
share
you
can
not
i
can
i
shall
i
feel
that
we
shall
be
together
in
soul
and
perhaps
perhaps
even
androvsky
looked
profoundly
agitated
his
hands
dropped
down
i
must
go
he
said
i
must
go
to
the
he
got
up
from
the
sand
come
to
the
tent
she
rose
to
her
feet
when
you
come
back
she
said
i
shall
be
waiting
for
you
he
looked
at
her
there
was
in
his
eyes
a
piercing
wistfulness
he
opened
his
lips
at
that
moment
domini
felt
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
telling
her
all
that
she
longed
to
know
but
the
look
faded
the
lips
closed
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
almost
desperately
no
no
he
said
i
ll
keep
your
love
i
ll
keep
you
could
never
lose
i
if
i
believed
boris
suddenly
burning
tears
rushed
from
her
eyes
don
t
ever
say
a
thing
like
that
to
me
again
she
said
with
passion
she
pointed
to
the
grave
close
to
them
if
you
were
there
she
said
and
i
was
living
and
you
had
died
before
before
you
had
told
me
i
believe
god
forgive
me
but
i
do
believe
that
if
when
you
died
i
were
taken
to
heaven
i
should
find
my
hell
she
looked
through
her
tears
at
the
words
priez
pour
to
pray
for
the
dead
she
whispered
as
if
to
herself
to
pray
for
my
dead
i
could
not
do
it
i
could
not
boris
if
you
love
me
you
must
trust
me
you
must
give
me
your
the
night
drew
on
androvsky
had
gone
to
the
priest
domini
was
alone
sitting
before
the
tent
waiting
for
his
return
she
had
told
batouch
and
ouardi
that
she
wanted
nothing
more
that
no
one
was
to
come
to
the
tent
again
that
night
the
young
moon
was
rising
over
the
city
but
its
light
as
yet
was
faint
it
fell
upon
the
cupolas
of
the
bureau
arabe
the
towers
of
the
mosque
and
the
white
sands
whose
whiteness
it
seemed
to
emphasise
making
them
pale
as
the
face
of
one
the
city
wall
cast
a
deep
shadow
over
the
moat
of
sand
in
which
wrapped
in
filthy
rags
lay
nomads
sleeping
upon
the
the
camps
were
alive
with
movement
fires
blazed
and
smoke
ascended
before
the
tents
that
made
patches
of
blackness
upon
the
waste
round
the
fires
were
seated
groups
of
men
devouring
and
the
red
soup
beloved
of
the
nomad
behind
them
circled
the
dogs
with
quivering
nostrils
squadrons
of
camels
lay
crouched
in
the
sand
resting
after
their
journeys
and
everywhere
from
the
city
and
from
the
waste
rose
distant
sounds
of
music
thin
aerial
flutings
like
voices
of
the
night
winds
acrid
cries
from
the
pipes
and
the
rolling
of
the
african
drums
that
are
the
foundation
of
every
desert
symphony
although
she
was
now
accustomed
to
the
music
of
africa
domini
could
never
hear
it
without
feeling
the
barbarity
of
the
land
from
which
it
rose
the
wildness
of
the
people
who
made
and
who
loved
it
always
it
suggested
to
her
an
infinite
remoteness
as
if
it
were
music
sounding
at
the
end
of
the
world
full
of
meanings
melancholy
yet
fierce
passion
longings
that
momentarily
satisfied
continually
renewed
themselves
griefs
that
were
hidden
behind
thin
veils
like
the
women
of
the
east
but
that
peered
out
with
expressive
eyes
hinting
their
story
and
desiring
assuagement
and
tonight
the
meaning
of
the
music
seemed
deeper
than
it
had
been
before
she
thought
of
it
as
an
outside
echo
of
the
voices
murmuring
in
her
mind
and
heart
and
the
voices
murmuring
in
the
mind
and
heart
of
androvsky
broken
voices
some
of
them
but
some
strong
fierce
tense
and
alive
with
meaning
and
as
she
sat
there
alone
she
thought
this
unity
of
music
drew
her
closer
to
the
desert
than
she
had
ever
been
before
and
drew
androvsky
with
her
despite
his
great
reserve
in
the
heart
of
the
desert
he
would
surely
let
her
see
at
last
fully
into
his
heart
when
he
came
back
in
the
night
from
the
priest
he
would
speak
she
was
waiting
for
that
the
moon
was
mounting
its
light
grew
stronger
she
looked
across
the
sands
and
saw
fires
in
the
city
and
suddenly
she
said
to
herself
this
is
the
vision
of
the
realised
in
my
life
he
saw
me
as
i
am
now
in
this
and
she
remembered
the
scene
in
the
garden
the
crouching
figure
the
extended
arms
the
thin
fingers
tracing
swift
patterns
in
the
sand
the
murmuring
voice
she
felt
deeply
expectant
but
almost
sad
encompassed
by
the
mystery
that
hangs
in
clouds
about
human
life
and
human
relations
what
could
be
that
great
joy
of
which
the
diviner
had
spoken
a
woman
s
great
joy
that
starred
the
desert
with
flowers
and
made
the
dry
places
run
with
sweet
waters
what
could
it
be
suddenly
she
felt
again
the
oppression
of
spirit
she
had
been
momentarily
conscious
of
in
the
afternoon
it
was
like
a
load
descending
upon
her
and
almost
instantly
communicated
itself
to
her
body
she
was
conscious
of
a
sensation
of
unusual
weariness
uneasiness
even
dread
then
again
of
an
intensity
of
life
that
startled
her
this
intensity
remained
grew
in
her
it
was
as
if
the
principle
of
life
like
a
fluid
were
being
poured
into
her
out
of
the
vials
of
god
as
if
the
little
cup
that
was
all
she
had
were
too
small
to
contain
the
precious
liquid
that
seemed
to
her
to
be
the
cause
of
the
pain
of
which
she
was
conscious
she
was
being
given
more
than
she
felt
herself
capable
of
possessing
she
got
up
from
her
chair
unable
to
remain
still
the
movement
slight
though
it
was
seemed
to
remove
a
veil
of
darkness
that
had
hung
over
her
and
to
let
in
upon
her
a
flood
of
light
she
caught
hold
of
the
canvas
of
the
tent
for
a
moment
she
felt
weak
as
a
child
then
strong
as
an
amazon
and
the
sense
of
strength
remained
grew
she
walked
out
upon
the
sand
in
the
direction
by
which
androvsky
would
return
the
fires
in
the
city
and
the
camps
were
to
her
as
illuminations
for
a
festival
the
music
was
the
music
of
a
great
rejoicing
the
vast
expanse
of
the
desert
wintry
white
under
the
moon
dotted
with
the
fires
of
the
nomads
blossomed
as
the
rose
after
a
few
moments
she
stopped
she
was
on
the
crest
of
a
and
could
see
below
her
the
faint
track
in
the
sand
which
wound
to
the
city
gate
by
this
track
androvsky
would
surely
return
from
a
long
distance
she
would
be
able
to
see
him
a
moving
darkness
upon
the
white
she
was
near
to
the
city
now
and
could
hear
voices
coming
to
her
from
behind
its
rugged
walls
voices
of
men
singing
and
calling
one
to
another
the
twang
of
plucked
instruments
the
click
of
negroes
castanets
the
city
was
full
of
joy
as
the
desert
was
full
of
joy
the
glory
of
life
rushed
upon
her
like
a
flood
of
gold
that
gold
of
the
sun
in
which
thousands
of
tiny
things
are
dancing
and
she
was
given
the
power
of
giving
life
of
adding
to
the
sum
of
glory
she
looked
out
over
the
sands
and
saw
a
moving
blot
upon
them
coming
slowly
towards
her
very
slowly
it
was
impossible
at
this
distance
to
see
who
it
was
but
she
felt
that
it
was
her
husband
for
a
moment
she
thought
of
going
down
to
meet
him
but
she
did
not
move
the
new
knowledge
that
had
come
to
her
made
her
just
then
feel
shy
even
of
him
as
if
he
must
come
to
her
as
if
she
could
make
no
advance
towards
him
as
the
blackness
upon
the
sand
drew
nearer
she
saw
that
it
was
a
man
walking
heavily
the
man
had
her
husband
s
gait
when
she
saw
that
she
turned
she
had
resolved
to
meet
him
at
the
tent
door
to
tell
him
what
she
had
to
tell
him
at
the
threshold
of
their
wandering
home
her
sense
of
shyness
died
when
she
was
at
the
tent
door
she
only
felt
now
her
oneness
with
her
husband
and
that
their
unity
was
to
be
made
more
perfect
if
it
could
be
made
quite
perfect
if
he
would
speak
too
then
nothing
more
would
be
wanting
at
last
every
veil
would
have
dropped
from
between
them
and
as
they
had
long
been
one
flesh
they
would
be
one
in
spirit
she
waited
in
the
tent
door
after
what
seemed
a
long
time
she
saw
androvsky
coming
across
the
moonlit
sand
he
was
walking
very
slowly
as
if
wearied
out
with
his
head
drooping
he
did
not
appear
to
see
her
till
he
was
quite
close
to
the
tent
then
he
stopped
and
gazed
at
her
the
moon
she
thought
it
must
be
the
moon
made
his
face
look
strange
like
a
dying
man
s
face
in
this
white
face
the
eyes
glittered
feverishly
boris
she
said
domini
come
here
close
to
me
i
have
something
to
tell
you
something
he
came
quite
up
to
her
domini
he
said
as
if
he
had
not
heard
her
domini
i
i
ve
been
to
the
priest
i
meant
to
confess
to
to
confess
she
said
this
afternoon
i
asked
him
to
hear
my
confession
but
tonight
i
could
not
make
it
i
can
only
make
it
to
you
domini
only
to
you
do
you
hear
domini
do
you
hear
something
in
his
face
and
in
his
voice
terrified
her
heart
now
she
felt
as
if
she
would
stop
him
from
speaking
if
she
dared
but
that
she
did
not
dare
his
spirit
was
beyond
domination
he
would
do
what
he
meant
to
do
regardless
of
her
of
anyone
what
is
it
boris
she
whispered
tell
me
perhaps
i
can
understand
best
because
i
love
he
put
his
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
as
a
man
kisses
the
woman
he
loves
when
he
knows
it
may
be
for
the
last
time
long
and
hard
with
a
desperation
of
love
that
feels
frustrated
by
the
very
lips
it
is
touching
at
last
he
took
his
lips
from
hers
domini
he
said
and
his
voice
was
steady
and
clear
almost
hard
you
want
to
know
what
it
is
that
makes
me
unhappy
even
in
our
love
desperately
unhappy
it
is
this
i
believe
in
god
i
love
god
and
i
have
insulted
him
i
have
tried
to
forget
god
to
deny
him
to
put
human
love
higher
than
love
for
him
but
always
i
am
haunted
by
the
thought
of
god
and
that
thought
makes
me
despair
once
when
i
was
young
i
gave
myself
to
god
solemnly
i
have
broken
the
vows
i
made
i
have
i
have
the
hardness
went
out
of
his
voice
he
broke
down
for
a
moment
and
was
silent
you
gave
yourself
to
god
she
said
how
he
tried
to
meet
her
questioning
eyes
but
could
not
i
i
gave
myself
to
god
as
a
monk
he
answered
after
a
pause
as
he
spoke
domini
saw
before
her
in
the
moonlight
de
trevignac
he
cast
a
glance
of
horror
at
the
tent
bent
over
her
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
vanished
in
his
place
stood
father
roubier
his
eyes
shining
his
hand
upraised
warning
her
against
androvsky
then
he
too
vanished
and
she
seemed
to
see
count
anteoni
dressed
as
an
arab
and
muttering
words
of
the
koran
domini
domini
did
you
hear
me
domini
domini
she
felt
his
hands
on
her
wrists
you
are
the
trappist
she
said
quietly
of
whom
the
priest
told
me
you
are
the
monk
from
the
monastery
of
who
disappeared
after
twenty
yes
he
said
i
am
what
made
you
tell
me
what
made
you
tell
me
there
was
agony
now
in
her
voice
you
asked
me
to
speak
but
it
was
not
that
do
you
remember
last
night
when
i
said
that
god
must
bless
you
you
answered
he
has
blessed
me
he
has
given
me
you
your
love
your
it
is
that
which
makes
me
speak
you
have
had
my
love
not
my
truth
now
take
my
truth
i
ve
kept
it
from
you
now
i
ll
give
it
you
it
s
black
but
i
ll
give
it
you
domini
domini
hate
me
but
in
your
hatred
believe
that
i
never
loved
you
as
i
love
you
give
me
your
truth

they
remained
standing
at
the
tent
door
with
the
growing
moonlight
about
them
the
camp
was
hushed
in
sleep
but
sounds
of
music
still
came
to
them
from
the
city
below
them
and
fainter
music
from
the
tents
of
the
ouled
nails
on
the
sandhill
to
the
south
after
domini
had
spoken
androvsky
moved
a
step
towards
her
looked
at
her
then
moved
back
and
dropped
his
eyes
if
he
had
gone
on
looking
at
her
he
knew
he
could
not
have
begun
to
speak
domini
he
said
i
m
not
going
to
try
and
excuse
myself
for
what
i
have
done
i
m
not
going
to
say
to
you
what
i
daren
t
say
to
god
forgive
how
can
such
a
thing
be
forgiven
that
s
part
of
the
torture
i
ve
been
enduring
the
knowledge
of
the
unforgivable
nature
of
my
act
it
can
never
be
wiped
out
it
s
black
on
my
judgment
book
for
ever
but
i
wonder
if
you
can
understand
oh
i
want
you
to
understand
domini
what
has
made
the
thing
i
am
a
renegade
a
breaker
of
oaths
a
liar
to
god
and
you
it
was
the
passion
of
life
that
burst
up
in
me
after
years
of
tranquillity
it
was
the
waking
of
my
nature
after
years
of
sleep
and
you
you
do
understand
the
passion
of
life
that
s
in
some
of
us
like
a
monster
that
must
rule
must
have
its
way
even
you
in
your
purity
and
goodness
you
have
it
that
desperate
wish
to
live
really
and
fully
as
we
have
lived
domini
together
for
we
have
lived
out
in
the
desert
we
lived
that
night
at
arba
when
we
sat
and
watched
the
fire
and
i
held
your
hand
against
the
earth
we
lived
then
even
now
when
i
think
of
that
night
i
can
hardly
be
sorry
for
what
i
ve
done
for
what
i
he
looked
up
at
her
now
and
saw
that
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
she
stood
motionless
with
her
hands
joined
in
front
of
her
her
attitude
was
calm
and
her
face
was
untortured
he
could
not
read
any
thought
of
hers
any
feeling
that
was
in
her
heart
you
must
understand
he
said
almost
violently
you
must
understand
or
i
my
father
i
told
you
was
a
russian
he
was
brought
up
in
the
greek
church
but
became
a
freethinker
when
he
was
still
a
young
man
my
mother
was
an
englishwoman
and
an
ardent
catholic
she
and
my
father
were
devoted
to
each
other
in
spite
of
the
difference
in
their
views
perhaps
the
chief
effect
my
father
s
lack
of
belief
had
upon
my
mother
was
to
make
her
own
belief
more
steadfast
more
ardent
i
think
disbelief
acts
often
as
a
fan
to
the
faith
of
women
makes
the
flame
burn
more
brightly
than
it
did
before
my
mother
tried
to
believe
for
herself
and
for
my
father
too
and
i
could
almost
think
that
she
succeeded
he
died
long
before
she
did
and
he
died
without
changing
his
views
on
his
he
told
my
mother
that
he
was
sure
there
was
no
other
life
that
he
was
going
to
the
dust
that
made
the
agony
of
his
farewell
the
certainty
on
his
part
that
he
and
my
mother
were
parting
for
ever
i
was
a
little
boy
at
the
time
but
i
remember
that
when
he
was
dead
my
mother
said
to
me
boris
pray
for
your
father
every
day
he
is
still
she
said
nothing
more
but
i
ran
upstairs
crying
fell
upon
my
knees
and
prayed
trying
to
think
where
my
father
was
and
what
he
could
be
looking
like
and
in
that
prayer
for
my
father
which
was
also
an
act
of
obedience
to
my
mother
i
think
i
took
the
first
step
towards
the
monastic
life
for
i
remember
that
then
for
the
first
time
i
was
conscious
of
a
great
sense
of
responsibility
my
mother
s
command
made
me
say
to
myself
then
perhaps
my
prayer
can
do
something
in
heaven
perhaps
a
prayer
from
me
can
make
god
wish
to
do
something
he
had
not
wished
to
do
that
was
a
tremendous
thought
it
excited
me
terribly
i
remember
my
cheeks
burned
as
i
prayed
and
that
i
was
hot
all
over
as
if
i
had
been
running
in
the
sun
from
that
day
my
mother
and
i
seemed
to
be
much
nearer
together
than
we
had
ever
been
before
i
had
a
twin
brother
to
whom
i
was
devoted
and
who
was
devoted
to
me
but
he
took
after
my
father
religious
things
ceremonies
church
music
processions
even
the
outside
attractions
of
the
catholic
church
which
please
and
stimulate
emotional
people
who
have
little
faith
never
meant
much
to
him
all
his
attention
was
firmly
fixed
upon
the
life
of
the
present
he
was
good
to
my
mother
and
loved
her
devotedly
as
he
loved
me
but
he
never
pretended
to
be
what
he
was
not
and
he
was
never
a
catholic
he
was
never
anything
my
father
had
originally
come
to
africa
for
his
health
which
needed
a
warm
climate
he
had
some
money
and
bought
large
tracts
of
land
suitable
for
vineyards
indeed
he
sunk
nearly
his
whole
fortune
in
land
i
told
you
domini
that
the
vines
were
devoured
by
the
phylloxera
most
of
the
money
was
lost
when
my
father
died
we
were
left
very
poor
we
lived
quietly
in
a
little
village
i
told
you
its
name
i
told
you
that
part
of
my
life
all
i
dared
tell
domini
but
now
why
did
i
enter
the
monastery
i
was
very
young
when
i
became
a
novice
just
seventeen
you
are
thinking
domini
i
know
that
i
was
too
young
to
know
what
i
was
doing
that
i
had
no
vocation
that
i
was
unfitted
for
the
monastic
life
it
seems
so
the
whole
world
would
think
so
and
yet
how
am
i
to
tell
you
even
now
i
feel
that
then
i
had
the
vocation
that
i
was
fitted
to
enter
the
monastery
that
i
ought
to
have
made
a
faithful
and
devoted
monk
my
mother
wished
the
life
for
me
but
it
was
not
only
that
i
wished
it
for
myself
then
with
my
whole
heart
i
wished
it
i
knew
nothing
of
the
world
my
youth
had
been
one
of
absolute
purity
and
i
did
not
feel
longings
after
the
unknown
my
mother
s
influence
upon
me
was
strong
but
she
did
not
force
me
into
anything
perhaps
my
love
for
her
led
me
more
than
i
knew
brought
me
to
the
monastery
door
the
passion
of
her
life
the
human
passion
had
been
my
father
after
he
was
dead
the
passion
of
her
life
was
prayer
for
him
my
love
for
her
made
me
share
that
passion
and
the
sharing
of
that
passion
eventually
led
me
to
become
a
monk
i
became
as
a
child
a
devotee
of
prayer
oh
domini
think
i
loved
prayer
i
loved
it
his
voice
broke
when
he
stopped
speaking
domini
was
again
conscious
of
the
music
in
the
city
she
remembered
that
earlier
in
the
night
she
had
thought
of
it
as
the
music
of
a
great
festival
i
resolved
to
enter
the
life
of
prayer
the
most
perfect
life
of
prayer
i
resolved
to
become
a
it
seemed
to
me
that
by
so
doing
i
should
be
proving
in
the
finest
way
my
love
for
my
mother
i
should
be
in
the
strongest
way
helping
her
her
life
was
prayer
for
my
dead
father
and
love
for
her
children
by
devoting
myself
to
the
life
of
prayer
i
should
show
to
her
that
i
was
as
she
was
as
she
had
made
me
true
son
of
her
womb
can
you
understand
i
had
a
passion
for
my
mother
domini
i
had
a
passion
my
brother
tried
to
dissuade
me
from
the
monastic
life
he
himself
was
going
into
business
in
tunis
he
wanted
me
to
join
him
but
i
was
firm
i
felt
driven
towards
the
cloister
then
as
other
men
often
feel
driven
towards
the
vicious
life
the
inclination
was
irresistible
i
yielded
to
it
i
had
to
bid
to
my
mother
i
told
you
she
was
the
passion
of
my
life
and
yet
i
hardly
felt
sad
at
parting
from
her
perhaps
that
will
show
you
how
i
was
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
should
be
even
closer
together
when
i
wore
the
monk
s
habit
i
was
in
haste
to
put
it
on
i
went
to
the
monastery
of
and
entered
it
as
a
novice
of
the
trappistine
order
i
thought
in
the
great
silence
of
the
trappists
there
would
be
more
room
for
prayer
when
i
left
my
home
and
went
to
i
took
with
me
one
treasure
only
domini
it
was
the
little
wooden
crucifix
you
pinned
upon
the
tent
at
arba
my
mother
gave
it
to
me
and
i
was
allowed
to
keep
it
everything
else
in
the
way
of
earthly
possessions
i
of
course
had
to
give
up
you
have
never
seen
my
home
for
nineteen
years
my
prison
for
one
it
is
lonely
but
not
in
the
least
desolate
it
stands
on
a
high
upland
and
from
a
distance
looks
upon
the
sea
far
off
there
are
mountains
the
land
was
a
desert
the
monks
have
turned
it
if
not
into
an
eden
at
least
into
a
rich
garden
there
are
vineyards
cornfields
orchards
almost
every
flourishes
there
the
springs
of
sweet
waters
are
abundant
at
a
short
way
from
the
monastery
is
a
large
village
for
the
spanish
workmen
whom
the
monks
supervise
in
the
labours
of
the
fields
for
the
trappist
life
is
not
only
a
life
of
prayer
but
a
life
of
diligent
labour
when
i
became
a
novice
i
had
not
realised
that
i
had
imagined
myself
continually
upon
my
knees
i
found
instead
that
i
was
perpetually
in
the
fields
in
sun
and
wind
and
rain
that
was
in
the
winter
time
working
like
the
labourers
and
that
often
when
we
went
into
the
long
plain
chapel
to
pray
i
was
so
tired
being
only
a
boy
that
my
eyes
closed
as
i
stood
in
my
stall
and
i
could
scarcely
hear
the
words
of
mass
or
benediction
but
i
had
expected
to
be
happy
at
and
i
was
happy
labour
is
good
for
the
body
and
better
for
the
soul
and
the
silence
was
not
hard
to
bear
the
trappists
have
a
book
of
gestures
and
are
often
allowed
to
converse
by
signs
we
novices
were
generally
in
little
bands
and
often
as
we
walked
in
the
garden
of
the
monastery
we
talked
together
gaily
with
our
hands
then
the
silence
is
not
perpetual
in
the
fields
we
often
had
to
give
directions
to
the
labourers
in
the
school
where
we
studied
theology
latin
greek
there
was
heard
the
voice
of
the
teacher
it
is
true
that
i
have
seen
men
in
the
monastery
day
by
day
for
twenty
years
with
whom
i
have
never
exchanged
a
word
but
i
have
had
permission
to
speak
with
monks
the
head
of
the
monastery
the
reverend
pere
has
the
power
to
loose
the
bonds
of
silence
when
he
chooses
and
to
allow
monks
to
walk
and
speak
with
each
other
beyond
the
white
walls
that
hem
in
the
garden
of
the
monastery
now
and
then
we
spoke
but
i
think
most
of
us
were
not
unhappy
in
our
silence
it
became
a
habit
and
then
we
were
always
occupied
we
had
no
time
allowed
us
for
sitting
and
being
sad
domini
i
don
t
want
to
tell
you
about
the
trappists
their
life
only
about
myself
why
i
was
as
i
was
how
i
came
to
change
for
years
i
was
not
unhappy
at
when
my
time
of
novitiate
was
over
i
took
the
eternal
vows
without
hesitation
many
novices
go
out
again
into
the
world
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
do
so
i
scarcely
ever
felt
a
stirring
of
worldly
desire
i
scarcely
ever
had
one
of
those
agonising
struggles
which
many
people
probably
attribute
to
monks
i
was
contented
nearly
always
now
and
then
the
flesh
spoke
but
not
strongly
remember
our
life
was
a
life
of
hard
and
exhausting
labour
in
the
fields
the
labour
kept
the
flesh
in
subjection
as
the
prayer
lifted
up
the
spirit
and
then
during
all
my
earlier
years
at
the
monastery
we
had
an
abbe
who
was
quick
to
understand
the
characters
and
dispositions
of
men
dom
andre
herceline
he
knew
me
far
better
than
i
knew
myself
he
knew
what
i
did
not
suspect
that
i
was
full
of
sleeping
violence
that
in
my
purity
and
devotion
or
beneath
it
rather
there
was
a
strong
strain
of
barbarism
the
russian
was
sleeping
in
the
monk
but
sleeping
soundly
that
can
be
half
a
man
s
nature
if
all
that
would
call
to
it
is
carefully
kept
from
it
may
sleep
i
believe
through
all
his
life
he
might
die
and
never
have
known
or
been
what
all
the
time
he
was
for
years
it
was
so
with
me
i
knew
only
part
of
myself
a
real
vivid
part
but
only
a
part
i
thought
it
was
the
whole
and
while
i
thought
it
was
the
whole
i
was
happy
if
dom
andre
herceline
had
not
died
today
i
should
be
a
monk
at
ignorant
of
what
i
know
contented
he
never
allowed
me
to
come
into
any
sort
of
contact
with
the
many
strangers
who
visited
the
monastery
different
monks
have
different
duties
certain
duties
bring
monks
into
connection
with
the
travellers
whom
curiosity
sends
to
the
monk
whose
business
it
is
to
look
after
the
cemetery
on
the
hill
where
the
dead
trappists
are
laid
to
rest
shows
visitors
round
the
little
chapel
and
may
talk
with
them
freely
so
long
as
they
remain
in
the
cemetery
the
monk
in
charge
of
the
distillery
also
receives
visitors
and
converses
with
them
so
does
the
monk
in
charge
of
the
parlour
at
the
great
door
of
the
monastery
he
sells
the
souvenirs
of
the
trappists
photographs
of
the
church
and
buildings
statues
of
saints
bottles
of
perfumes
made
by
the
monks
he
takes
the
orders
for
the
wines
made
at
the
monastery
and
for
for
the
what
i
made
domini
when
i
was
she
thought
of
de
trevignac
and
the
fragments
of
glass
lying
upon
the
ground
in
the
tent
at
mogar
had
de
trevignac
she
said
in
a
low
inward
voice
he
had
seen
me
spoken
with
me
at
the
monastery
when
ouardi
brought
in
the
liqueur
he
remembered
who
i
she
understood
de
trevignac
s
glance
towards
the
tent
where
androvsky
lay
sleeping
and
a
slight
shiver
ran
through
her
androvsky
saw
it
and
looked
down
but
the
the
he
cleared
his
throat
turned
looked
out
across
the
white
sand
as
if
he
longed
to
travel
away
into
it
and
be
lost
for
ever
then
went
on
speaking
quickly
but
the
monk
who
has
most
to
do
with
travellers
is
the
monk
who
is
in
charge
of
the
of
the
monastery
he
is
the
host
to
all
visitors
to
those
who
come
over
for
the
day
and
have
and
to
any
who
remain
for
the
night
or
for
a
longer
time
for
when
i
was
at
it
was
permitted
for
people
to
stay
in
the
on
payment
of
a
small
weekly
sum
for
as
long
as
they
pleased
the
monk
of
the
is
perpetually
brought
into
contact
with
the
outside
world
he
talks
with
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
women
of
course
are
not
admitted
the
other
monks
many
of
them
probably
envy
him
i
never
did
i
had
no
wish
to
see
strangers
when
by
chance
i
met
them
in
the
yard
the
outbuildings
or
the
grounds
of
the
monastery
i
seldom
even
raised
my
eyes
to
look
at
them
they
were
not
would
never
be
in
my
life
why
should
i
look
at
them
what
were
they
to
me
years
went
on
quickly
they
passed
not
slowly
i
did
not
feel
their
monotony
i
never
shrank
from
anything
in
the
life
my
health
was
splendid
i
never
knew
what
it
was
to
be
ill
for
a
day
my
muscles
were
hard
as
iron
the
pallet
on
which
i
lay
in
my
cubicle
the
heavy
robe
i
wore
day
and
night
the
scanty
vegetables
i
ate
the
bell
that
called
me
from
my
sleep
in
the
darkness
to
go
to
the
chapel
the
fastings
the
watchings
the
perpetual
sameness
of
all
i
saw
all
i
did
neither
saddened
nor
fatigued
me
i
never
sighed
for
change
can
you
believe
that
domini
it
is
true
so
long
as
dom
andre
herceline
lived
and
ruled
my
life
i
was
calm
happy
as
few
people
in
the
world
or
none
can
ever
be
but
dom
andre
died
and
then
his
face
was
contorted
by
a
spasm
my
mother
was
dead
my
brother
lived
on
in
tunis
and
was
successful
in
business
he
remained
unmarried
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
although
the
monastery
was
but
two
hours
drive
from
the
town
he
might
almost
have
been
dead
too
i
scarcely
ever
saw
him
and
then
only
by
a
special
permission
from
the
reverend
pere
and
for
a
few
moments
once
i
visited
him
at
tunis
when
he
was
ill
when
my
mother
died
i
seemed
to
sink
down
a
little
deeper
into
the
monastic
life
that
was
all
it
was
as
if
i
drew
my
robe
more
closely
round
me
and
pulled
my
hood
further
forward
over
my
face
there
was
more
reason
for
my
prayers
and
i
prayed
more
passionately
i
lived
in
prayer
like
a
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
prayer
was
about
me
like
a
fluid
but
dom
andre
herceline
died
and
a
new
abbe
was
appointed
he
who
i
suppose
rules
now
at
he
was
a
good
man
but
i
think
apt
to
misunderstand
men
the
abbe
of
a
trappist
monastery
has
complete
power
over
his
community
he
can
order
what
he
will
soon
after
he
came
to
for
some
reason
that
i
can
not
divine
he
removed
the
pere
michel
who
had
been
for
years
in
charge
of
the
cemetery
from
his
duties
there
and
informed
me
that
i
was
to
undertake
them
i
obeyed
of
course
without
a
word
the
cemetery
of
is
on
a
low
hill
the
highest
part
of
the
monastery
grounds
it
is
surrounded
by
a
white
wall
and
by
a
hedge
of
cypress
trees
the
road
to
it
is
an
avenue
of
cypresses
among
which
are
interspersed
niches
containing
carvings
of
the
fourteen
stations
of
the
cross
at
the
entrance
to
this
avenue
on
the
left
there
is
a
high
yellow
pedestal
surmounted
by
a
black
cross
on
which
hangs
a
silver
christ
underneath
is
written
factus
obediens
usque
ad
mortem
crucis
i
remember
on
the
first
day
when
i
became
the
guardian
of
the
cemetery
stopping
on
my
way
to
it
before
the
christ
and
praying
my
prayer
my
prayer
was
domini
that
i
might
die
as
i
had
lived
in
innocence
i
prayed
for
that
but
with
a
sort
of
yes
now
i
think
so
insolent
certainty
that
my
prayer
would
of
course
be
granted
then
i
went
on
to
the
cemetery
my
work
there
was
easy
i
had
only
to
tend
the
land
about
the
graves
and
sweep
out
the
little
chapel
where
was
buried
the
founder
of
la
trappe
of
this
done
i
could
wander
about
the
cemetery
or
sit
on
a
bench
in
the
sun
the
pere
michel
who
was
my
predecessor
had
some
doves
and
had
left
them
behind
in
a
little
house
by
my
bench
i
took
care
of
and
fed
them
they
were
tame
and
used
to
flutter
to
my
shoulders
and
perch
on
my
hands
to
birds
and
animals
i
was
always
a
friend
at
there
are
all
sorts
of
beasts
and
at
one
time
or
another
it
had
been
my
duty
to
look
after
most
of
them
i
loved
all
living
things
sitting
in
the
cemetery
i
could
see
a
great
stretch
of
country
the
blue
of
the
lakes
of
tunis
with
the
white
villages
at
their
edge
the
boats
gliding
upon
them
towards
the
white
city
the
distant
mountains
having
little
to
do
i
sat
day
after
day
for
hours
meditating
and
looking
out
upon
this
distant
world
i
remember
specially
one
evening
at
sunset
just
before
i
had
to
go
to
the
chapel
that
a
sort
of
awe
came
upon
me
as
i
looked
across
the
lakes
the
sky
was
golden
the
waters
were
dyed
with
gold
out
of
which
rose
the
white
sails
of
boats
the
mountains
were
shadowy
purple
the
little
minarets
of
the
mosques
rose
into
the
gold
like
sticks
of
ivory
as
i
watched
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
i
felt
a
sort
of
aching
in
my
heart
and
as
if
domini
it
was
as
if
at
that
moment
a
hand
was
laid
on
mine
but
very
gently
and
pulled
at
my
hand
it
was
as
if
at
that
moment
someone
was
beside
me
in
the
cemetery
wishing
to
lead
me
out
to
those
waters
those
mosque
towers
those
purple
mountains
never
before
had
i
had
such
a
sensation
it
frightened
me
i
felt
as
if
the
devil
had
come
into
the
cemetery
as
if
his
hand
was
laid
on
mine
as
if
his
voice
were
whispering
in
my
ear
come
out
with
me
into
that
world
that
beautiful
world
which
god
made
for
men
why
do
you
reject
it
that
evening
domini
was
the
beginning
of
this
this
end
day
after
day
i
sat
in
the
cemetery
and
looked
out
over
the
world
and
wondered
what
it
was
like
what
were
the
lives
of
the
men
who
sailed
in
the
boats
who
crowded
on
the
steamers
whose
smoke
i
could
see
sometimes
faintly
trailing
away
into
the
track
of
the
sun
who
kept
the
sheep
upon
the
mountains
who
who
domini
can
you
imagine
no
you
can
not
what
in
a
man
of
my
age
of
my
blood
were
these
first
very
first
stirrings
of
the
longing
for
life
sometimes
i
think
they
were
like
the
first
of
a
woman
who
is
going
to
be
a
domini
s
hands
moved
apart
then
joined
themselves
again
there
was
something
physical
in
them
i
felt
as
if
my
limbs
had
minds
and
that
their
minds
which
had
been
asleep
were
waking
my
arms
twitched
with
a
desire
to
stretch
themselves
towards
the
distant
blue
of
the
lakes
on
which
i
should
never
sail
my
i
was
physically
stirred
and
again
and
again
i
felt
that
hand
laid
closely
upon
mine
as
if
to
draw
me
away
into
something
i
had
never
known
could
never
know
do
not
think
that
i
did
not
strive
against
these
first
stirrings
of
the
nature
that
had
slept
so
long
for
days
i
refused
to
let
myself
look
out
from
the
cemetery
i
kept
my
eyes
upon
the
ground
upon
the
plain
crosses
that
marked
the
graves
i
played
with
the
doves
i
worked
but
my
eyes
at
last
rebelled
i
said
to
myself
it
is
not
forbidden
to
and
again
the
sails
the
seas
the
towers
the
mountains
were
as
voices
whispering
to
me
why
will
you
never
know
us
draw
near
to
us
why
will
you
never
understand
our
meaning
why
will
you
be
ignorant
for
ever
of
all
that
has
been
created
for
man
to
know
then
the
pain
within
me
became
almost
unbearable
at
night
i
could
not
sleep
in
the
chapel
it
was
difficult
to
pray
i
looked
at
the
monks
around
me
to
most
of
whom
i
had
never
addressed
a
word
and
i
thought
do
they
too
hold
such
longings
within
them
are
they
too
shaken
with
a
desire
of
knowledge
it
seemed
to
me
that
instead
of
a
place
of
peace
the
monastery
was
must
be
a
place
of
tumult
of
the
silent
tumult
that
has
its
home
in
the
souls
of
men
but
then
i
remembered
for
how
long
i
had
been
at
peace
perhaps
all
the
silent
men
by
whom
i
was
surrounded
were
still
at
peace
as
i
had
been
as
i
might
be
again
a
young
monk
died
in
the
monastery
and
was
buried
in
the
cemetery
i
made
his
grave
against
the
outer
wall
beneath
a
cypress
tree
some
days
afterwards
when
i
was
sitting
on
the
bench
by
the
house
of
the
doves
i
heard
a
sound
which
came
from
beyond
the
wall
it
was
like
sobbing
i
listened
and
heard
it
more
distinctly
and
knew
that
it
was
someone
crying
and
sobbing
desperately
and
near
at
hand
but
now
it
seemed
to
me
to
come
from
the
wall
itself
i
got
up
and
listened
someone
was
crying
bitterly
behind
or
above
the
wall
just
where
the
young
monk
had
been
buried
who
could
it
be
i
stood
listening
wondering
hesitating
what
to
do
there
was
something
in
this
sound
of
lamentation
that
moved
one
to
the
depths
for
years
i
had
not
looked
on
a
woman
or
heard
a
woman
s
voice
but
i
knew
that
this
was
a
woman
mourning
why
was
she
there
what
could
she
want
i
glanced
up
all
round
the
cemetery
as
i
have
said
grew
cypress
trees
as
i
glanced
up
i
saw
one
shake
just
above
where
the
new
grave
was
and
a
woman
s
voice
said
i
can
not
see
it
i
can
not
see
it
i
do
not
know
why
but
i
felt
that
someone
was
there
who
wished
to
see
the
young
monk
s
grave
for
a
moment
i
stood
there
then
i
went
to
the
house
where
i
kept
my
tools
for
my
work
in
the
cemetery
and
got
a
shears
which
i
used
for
lopping
the
cypress
trees
i
took
a
ladder
quickly
set
it
against
the
wall
mounted
it
and
from
the
cypress
i
had
seen
moving
i
lopped
some
of
the
boughs
the
sobbing
ceased
as
the
boughs
fell
down
from
the
tree
i
saw
a
woman
s
face
staring
at
me
it
seemed
to
me
a
lovely
face
which
is
his
grave
she
said
i
pointed
to
the
grave
of
the
young
monk
which
could
now
be
seen
through
the
gap
i
had
made
descended
the
ladder
and
went
away
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
cemetery
and
i
did
not
look
again
in
the
direction
of
the
woman
s
face
who
she
was
i
do
not
know
when
she
went
away
i
did
not
see
she
loved
the
monk
who
had
died
and
knowing
that
women
can
not
enter
the
precincts
of
the
monastery
she
had
come
to
the
outside
wall
to
cast
if
she
might
a
despairing
glance
at
his
grave
domini
i
wonder
i
wonder
if
you
can
understand
how
that
incident
affected
me
to
an
ordinary
man
it
would
seem
nothing
i
suppose
but
to
a
trappist
monk
it
seemed
tremendous
i
had
seen
a
woman
i
had
done
something
for
a
woman
i
thought
of
her
of
what
i
had
done
for
her
perpetually
the
gap
in
the
cypress
tree
reminded
me
of
her
every
time
i
looked
towards
it
when
i
was
in
the
cemetery
i
could
hardly
turn
my
eyes
from
it
but
the
woman
never
came
again
i
said
nothing
to
the
reverend
pere
of
what
i
had
done
i
ought
to
have
spoken
but
i
did
not
i
kept
it
back
when
i
confessed
from
that
moment
i
had
a
secret
and
it
was
a
secret
connected
with
a
woman
does
it
seem
strange
to
you
that
this
secret
seemed
to
me
to
set
me
apart
from
all
the
other
monks
nearer
the
world
it
was
so
i
felt
sometimes
as
if
i
had
been
out
into
the
world
for
a
moment
had
known
the
meaning
that
women
have
for
men
i
wondered
who
the
woman
was
i
wondered
how
she
had
loved
the
young
monk
who
was
dead
he
used
to
sit
beside
me
in
the
chapel
he
had
a
pure
and
beautiful
face
such
a
face
i
supposed
as
a
woman
might
well
love
had
this
woman
loved
him
and
had
he
rejected
her
love
for
the
life
of
the
monastery
i
remember
one
day
thinking
of
this
and
wondering
how
it
had
been
possible
for
him
to
do
so
and
then
suddenly
realising
the
meaning
of
my
thought
and
turning
hot
with
shame
i
had
put
the
love
of
woman
above
the
love
of
god
woman
s
service
above
god
s
service
that
day
i
was
terrified
of
myself
i
went
back
to
the
monastery
from
the
cemetery
quickly
asked
to
see
the
reverend
pere
and
begged
him
to
remove
me
from
the
cemetery
to
give
me
some
other
work
he
did
not
ask
my
reason
for
wishing
to
change
but
three
days
afterwards
he
sent
for
me
and
told
me
that
i
was
to
be
placed
in
charge
of
the
of
the
monastery
and
that
my
duties
there
were
to
begin
upon
the
morrow
domini
i
wonder
if
i
can
make
you
realise
what
that
change
meant
to
a
man
who
had
lived
as
i
had
for
so
many
years
the
of
is
a
long
low
building
standing
in
a
garden
full
of
palms
and
geraniums
it
contains
a
kitchen
a
number
of
little
rooms
like
cells
for
visitors
and
two
large
parlours
in
which
guests
are
entertained
at
meals
in
one
they
sit
to
eat
the
fruit
eggs
and
vegetables
provided
by
the
monastery
with
wine
if
after
the
meal
they
wish
to
take
coffee
they
pass
into
the
second
parlour
visitors
who
stay
in
the
monastery
are
free
to
do
much
as
they
please
but
they
must
conform
to
certain
rules
they
rise
at
a
certain
hour
feed
at
fixed
times
and
are
obliged
to
go
to
their
bedrooms
at
seven
in
the
evening
in
winter
and
at
eight
in
summer
the
monk
in
charge
of
the
has
to
see
to
their
comfort
he
looks
after
the
kitchen
is
always
in
the
parlour
at
some
moment
or
another
during
meals
he
visits
the
bedrooms
and
takes
care
that
the
one
servant
keeps
everything
spotlessly
clean
he
shows
people
round
the
garden
his
duties
you
see
are
light
and
social
he
can
not
go
into
the
world
but
he
can
mix
with
the
world
that
comes
to
him
it
is
his
task
if
not
his
pleasure
to
be
cheerful
talkative
sympathetic
a
good
host
with
a
genial
welcome
for
all
who
come
to
la
trappe
after
my
years
of
labour
solitude
silence
and
prayer
i
was
abruptly
put
into
this
new
life
domini
to
me
it
was
like
rushing
out
into
the
world
i
was
almost
dazed
by
the
change
at
first
i
was
nervous
timid
awkward
and
especially
the
habit
of
silence
had
taken
such
a
hold
upon
me
that
i
could
not
throw
it
off
i
dreaded
the
coming
of
visitors
i
did
not
know
how
to
receive
them
what
to
say
to
them
fortunately
as
i
thought
the
tourist
season
was
over
the
summer
was
approaching
very
few
people
came
and
those
only
to
eat
a
meal
i
tried
to
be
polite
and
pleasant
to
them
and
gradually
i
began
to
fall
into
the
way
of
talking
without
the
difficulty
i
had
experienced
at
first
in
the
beginning
i
could
not
open
my
lips
without
feeling
as
if
i
were
almost
committing
a
crime
but
presently
i
was
more
natural
less
taciturn
i
even
now
and
then
took
some
pleasure
in
speaking
to
a
pleasant
visitor
i
grew
to
love
the
garden
with
its
flowers
its
orange
trees
its
groves
of
eucalyptus
its
vineyard
which
sloped
towards
the
cemetery
often
i
wandered
in
it
alone
or
sat
under
the
arcade
that
divided
it
from
the
large
entrance
court
of
the
monastery
meditating
listening
to
the
bees
humming
and
watching
the
cats
basking
in
the
sunshine
sometimes
when
i
was
there
i
thought
of
the
woman
s
face
above
the
cemetery
wall
sometimes
i
seemed
to
feel
the
hand
tugging
at
mine
but
i
was
more
at
peace
than
i
had
been
in
the
cemetery
for
from
the
garden
i
could
not
see
the
distant
world
and
of
the
chance
visitors
none
had
as
yet
set
a
match
to
the
torch
that
unknown
to
me
was
ready
at
the
coming
of
the
smallest
spark
to
burst
into
a
flame
one
day
it
was
in
the
morning
towards
ten
when
i
was
sitting
reading
my
greek
testament
on
a
bench
just
inside
the
doorway
of
the
i
heard
the
great
door
of
the
monastery
being
opened
and
then
the
rolling
of
carriage
wheels
in
the
courtyard
some
visitor
had
arrived
from
tunis
perhaps
some
visitors
three
or
four
it
was
a
radiant
morning
of
late
may
the
garden
was
brilliant
with
flowers
golden
with
sunshine
tender
with
shade
and
quiet
quiet
and
peaceful
domini
there
was
a
wonderful
peace
in
the
garden
that
day
a
peace
that
seemed
full
of
safety
of
enduring
cheerfulness
the
flowers
looked
as
if
they
had
hearts
to
understand
it
and
love
it
the
roses
along
the
yellow
wall
of
the
house
that
clambered
to
the
brown
red
tiles
the
geraniums
that
grew
in
masses
under
the
shining
leaves
of
the
orange
trees
the
i
felt
as
if
that
day
i
were
in
the
garden
of
eden
and
i
remember
that
when
i
heard
the
carriage
wheels
i
had
a
moment
of
selfish
sadness
i
thought
why
does
anyone
come
to
disturb
my
blessed
peace
my
blessed
solitude
then
i
realised
the
egoism
of
my
thought
and
that
i
was
there
with
my
duty
i
got
up
went
into
the
kitchen
and
said
to
francois
the
servant
that
someone
had
come
and
no
doubt
would
stay
to
and
as
i
spoke
already
i
was
thinking
of
the
moment
when
i
should
hear
the
roll
of
wheels
once
more
the
clang
of
the
shutting
gate
and
know
that
the
intruders
upon
the
peace
of
the
trappists
had
gone
back
to
the
world
and
that
i
could
once
more
be
alone
in
the
little
eden
i
loved
strangely
domini
strangely
that
day
of
all
the
days
of
my
life
i
was
most
in
love
it
was
like
that
like
being
in
love
with
my
monk
s
existence
the
terrible
feeling
that
had
begun
to
ravage
me
had
completely
died
away
i
adored
the
peace
in
which
my
days
were
passed
i
looked
at
the
flowers
and
compared
my
happiness
with
theirs
they
blossomed
bloomed
faded
died
in
the
garden
so
would
i
wish
to
blossom
bloom
fade
when
my
time
came
die
in
the
garden
always
in
peace
always
in
safety
always
isolated
from
the
terrors
of
life
always
under
the
tender
watchful
eye
of
of
domini
that
day
i
was
happy
as
perhaps
they
are
perhaps
the
saints
in
paradise
i
was
happy
because
i
felt
no
inclination
to
evil
i
felt
as
if
my
joy
lay
entirely
in
being
innocent
oh
what
an
ecstasy
such
a
feeling
is
my
will
accord
with
thy
design
i
love
to
live
as
thou
intendest
me
to
live
any
other
way
of
life
would
be
to
me
a
terror
would
bring
to
me
and
i
felt
that
intensely
i
felt
it
at
that
moment
in
heart
and
soul
it
was
as
if
i
had
god
s
arms
round
me
caressing
me
as
a
father
caresses
his
he
moved
away
a
step
or
two
in
the
sand
came
back
and
went
on
with
an
effort
within
a
few
minutes
the
porter
of
the
monastery
came
through
the
archway
of
the
arcade
followed
by
a
young
man
as
i
looked
up
at
him
i
was
uncertain
of
his
nationality
but
i
scarcely
thought
about
it
except
in
the
first
moment
for
something
else
seized
my
attention
the
intense
active
misery
in
the
stranger
s
face
he
looked
ravaged
eaten
by
grief
i
said
he
was
young
perhaps
or
his
face
was
rather
with
small
good
features
he
had
thick
brown
hair
and
his
eyes
shone
with
intelligence
with
an
intelligence
that
was
almost
painful
somehow
his
eyes
always
looked
to
me
as
if
they
were
seeing
too
much
had
always
seen
too
much
there
was
a
restlessness
in
the
swiftness
of
their
observation
one
could
not
conceive
of
them
closed
in
sleep
an
activity
that
must
surely
be
eternal
blazed
in
them
the
porter
left
the
stranger
in
the
archway
it
was
now
my
duty
to
attend
to
him
i
welcomed
him
in
french
he
took
off
his
hat
when
he
did
that
i
felt
sure
he
was
an
englishman
by
the
look
of
him
bareheaded
and
i
told
him
that
i
spoke
english
as
well
as
french
he
answered
that
he
was
at
home
in
french
but
that
he
was
english
we
talked
english
his
entrance
into
the
garden
had
entirely
destroyed
my
sense
of
its
peace
even
my
own
peace
was
disturbed
at
once
by
his
appearance
i
felt
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
misery
that
was
like
a
devouring
element
before
we
had
time
for
more
than
a
very
few
halting
words
the
bell
was
rung
by
francois
what
s
that
for
father
the
stranger
said
with
a
start
which
showed
that
his
nerves
were
shattered
it
is
time
for
your
meal
i
answered
one
must
eat
he
said
then
as
if
conscious
that
he
was
behaving
oddly
he
added
politely
i
know
you
entertain
us
too
well
here
and
have
sometimes
been
rewarded
with
coarse
ingratitude
where
do
i
go
i
showed
him
into
the
parlour
there
was
no
one
there
that
day
he
sat
at
the
long
table
i
am
to
eat
alone
he
asked
yes
i
will
serve
francois
always
waited
on
the
guests
but
that
day
mindful
of
the
selfishness
of
my
thoughts
in
the
garden
i
resolved
to
add
to
my
duties
i
therefore
brought
the
soup
the
lentils
the
omelette
the
oranges
poured
out
the
wine
and
urged
the
young
man
cordially
to
eat
when
i
did
so
he
looked
up
at
me
his
eyes
were
extraordinarily
expressive
it
was
as
if
i
heard
them
say
to
me
why
i
like
you
and
as
if
just
for
a
moment
his
grief
were
lessened
in
the
empty
parlour
long
clean
bare
with
a
crucifix
on
the
wall
and
the
name
saint
bernard
above
the
door
it
was
very
quiet
very
shady
the
outer
blinds
of
green
wood
were
drawn
over
the
shutting
out
the
gold
of
the
garden
but
its
murmuring
tranquillity
seemed
to
filter
in
as
if
the
flowers
the
insects
the
birds
were
aware
of
our
presence
and
were
trying
to
say
to
us
are
you
happy
as
we
are
be
happy
as
we
the
stranger
looked
at
the
shady
room
the
open
windows
he
sighed
how
quiet
it
is
here
he
said
almost
as
if
to
himself
how
quiet
it
is
yes
i
answered
summer
is
beginning
for
months
now
scarcely
anyone
will
come
to
us
us
he
said
glancing
at
me
with
a
sudden
smile
i
meant
to
us
who
are
monks
who
live
always
may
i
is
it
indiscreet
to
ask
if
you
have
been
here
long
i
told
him
more
than
nineteen
years
he
said
and
always
in
this
silence
he
sat
as
if
listening
resting
his
head
on
his
hand
how
extraordinary
he
said
at
last
how
wonderful
is
it
happiness
i
did
not
answer
the
question
seemed
to
me
to
be
addressed
to
himself
not
to
me
i
could
leave
him
to
seek
for
the
answer
after
a
moment
he
went
on
eating
and
drinking
in
silence
when
he
had
finished
i
asked
him
whether
he
would
take
coffee
he
said
he
would
and
i
made
him
pass
into
the
joseph
there
i
brought
him
coffee
and
and
that
liqueur
i
told
him
that
it
was
my
invention
he
seemed
to
be
interested
at
any
rate
he
took
a
glass
and
praised
it
strongly
i
was
pleased
i
think
i
showed
it
from
that
moment
i
felt
as
if
we
were
almost
friends
never
before
had
i
experienced
such
a
feeling
for
anyone
who
had
come
to
the
monastery
or
for
any
monk
or
novice
in
the
monastery
although
i
had
been
vexed
irritated
at
the
approach
of
a
stranger
i
now
felt
regret
at
the
idea
of
his
going
away
presently
the
time
came
to
show
him
round
the
garden
we
went
out
of
the
shadowy
parlour
into
the
sunshine
no
one
was
in
the
garden
only
the
bees
were
humming
the
birds
were
passing
the
cats
were
basking
on
the
broad
path
that
stretched
from
the
arcade
along
the
front
of
the
as
we
came
out
a
bell
chimed
breaking
for
an
instant
the
silence
and
making
it
seem
the
sweeter
when
it
returned
we
strolled
for
a
little
while
we
did
not
talk
much
the
stranger
s
eyes
i
noticed
were
everywhere
taking
in
every
detail
of
the
scene
around
us
presently
we
came
to
the
vineyard
to
the
left
of
which
was
the
road
that
led
to
the
cemetery
passed
up
the
road
and
arrived
at
the
cemetery
gate
here
i
must
leave
you
i
said
why
he
asked
quickly
there
is
another
father
who
will
show
you
the
chapel
i
shall
wait
for
you
i
sat
down
and
waited
when
the
stranger
returned
it
seemed
to
me
that
his
face
was
calmer
that
there
was
a
quieter
expression
in
his
eyes
when
we
were
once
more
before
the
i
said
you
have
seen
all
my
small
domain
he
glanced
at
the
house
but
there
seems
to
be
a
number
of
rooms
he
said
only
the
bedrooms
do
people
stay
the
night
here
sometimes
if
they
please
they
can
stay
for
longer
than
a
how
much
longer
for
any
time
they
please
if
they
conform
to
one
or
two
simple
rules
and
pay
a
small
fixed
sum
to
the
do
you
mean
that
you
could
take
anyone
in
for
the
summer
he
said
abruptly
why
not
the
consent
of
the
reverend
pere
has
to
be
obtained
that
is
i
should
like
to
see
the
i
took
him
in
and
showed
him
one
all
the
others
are
the
same
i
said
he
glanced
round
at
the
white
walls
the
rough
bed
the
crucifix
above
it
the
iron
basin
the
paved
floor
then
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
well
he
said
drawing
back
into
the
room
i
will
go
now
to
see
the
pere
abbe
if
it
is
on
the
garden
path
i
bade
him
he
shook
my
hand
there
was
an
odd
smile
in
his
face
later
i
saw
him
coming
again
through
the
arcade
father
he
said
i
am
not
going
away
i
have
asked
the
pere
abbe
s
permission
to
stay
here
he
has
given
it
to
me
such
luggage
as
i
need
will
be
sent
over
from
tunis
are
you
are
you
very
vexed
to
have
a
stranger
to
trouble
your
peace
his
intensely
observant
eyes
were
fixed
upon
me
while
he
spoke
i
answered
i
do
not
think
you
will
trouble
my
and
my
thought
was
i
will
help
you
to
find
the
peace
which
you
have
was
it
a
presumptuous
thought
domini
was
it
insolent
at
the
time
it
seemed
to
me
absolutely
sincere
one
of
the
best
thoughts
i
had
ever
had
a
thought
put
into
my
heart
by
god
i
didn
t
know
then
i
didn
t
he
stopped
speaking
and
stood
for
a
time
quite
still
looking
down
at
the
sand
which
was
silver
white
under
the
moon
at
last
he
lifted
his
head
and
said
speaking
slowly
it
was
the
coming
of
this
man
that
put
the
spark
to
that
torch
it
was
he
who
woke
up
in
me
the
half
of
myself
which
unsuspected
by
me
had
been
slumbering
through
all
my
life
slumbering
and
gathering
strength
in
slumber
as
the
body
does
gathering
a
strength
that
was
tremendous
that
was
to
overmaster
the
whole
of
me
that
was
to
make
of
me
one
mad
impulse
he
woke
up
in
me
the
body
and
the
body
was
to
take
possession
of
the
soul
i
wonder
can
i
make
you
feel
why
this
man
was
able
to
affect
me
thus
can
i
make
you
know
this
man
he
was
a
man
full
of
secret
violence
violence
of
the
mind
and
violence
of
the
body
a
volcanic
man
he
was
english
he
said
so
but
there
must
have
been
blood
that
was
not
english
in
his
veins
when
i
was
with
him
i
felt
as
if
i
was
with
fire
there
was
the
restlessness
of
fire
in
him
there
was
the
intensity
of
fire
he
could
be
reserved
he
could
appear
to
be
cold
but
always
i
was
conscious
that
if
there
was
stone
without
there
was
scorching
heat
within
he
was
watchful
of
himself
and
of
everyone
with
whom
he
came
into
the
slightest
contact
he
was
very
clever
he
had
an
immense
amount
of
personal
charm
i
think
at
any
rate
for
me
he
was
very
human
passionately
interested
in
humanity
he
was
and
this
was
specially
part
of
him
a
dominant
trait
he
was
savagely
yes
savagely
eager
to
be
happy
and
when
he
came
to
live
in
the
he
was
savagely
unhappy
an
egoist
he
was
a
thinker
a
man
who
longed
to
lay
hold
of
something
beyond
this
world
but
who
had
not
been
able
to
do
so
even
his
desire
to
find
rest
in
a
religion
seemed
to
me
to
have
greed
in
it
to
have
something
in
it
that
was
akin
to
avarice
he
was
a
human
storm
domini
as
well
as
a
human
fire
think
what
a
man
to
be
cast
by
the
world
which
he
knew
as
they
know
it
only
who
are
voracious
for
life
and
free
into
my
quiet
existence
very
soon
he
began
to
show
himself
to
me
as
he
was
with
a
sort
of
fearlessness
that
was
almost
impudent
the
conditions
of
our
two
lives
in
the
monastery
threw
us
perpetually
together
in
a
curious
isolation
and
the
reverend
pere
domini
the
reverend
pere
set
my
feet
in
the
path
of
my
own
destruction
on
the
day
after
the
stranger
had
arrived
the
reverend
pere
sent
for
me
to
his
private
room
and
said
to
me
our
new
guest
is
in
a
very
unhappy
state
he
has
been
attracted
by
our
peace
if
we
can
bring
peace
to
him
it
will
be
an
action
acceptable
to
god
you
will
be
much
with
him
try
to
do
him
good
he
is
not
a
catholic
but
no
matter
he
wishes
to
attend
the
services
in
the
chapel
he
may
be
influenced
god
may
have
guided
his
feet
to
us
we
can
not
tell
but
we
can
act
we
can
pray
for
him
i
do
not
know
how
long
he
will
stay
it
may
be
for
only
a
few
days
or
for
the
whole
summer
it
does
not
matter
use
each
day
well
for
him
each
day
may
be
his
last
with
i
went
out
from
the
reverend
pere
full
of
enthusiasm
feeling
that
a
great
a
splendid
interest
had
come
into
my
life
an
interest
such
as
it
had
never
held
before
day
by
day
i
was
with
this
man
of
course
there
were
many
hours
when
we
were
apart
the
hours
when
i
was
at
prayer
in
the
chapel
or
occupied
with
study
but
each
day
we
passed
much
time
together
generally
in
the
garden
scarcely
any
visitors
came
and
none
to
stay
except
from
time
to
time
a
passing
priest
and
once
two
young
men
from
tunis
one
of
whom
had
an
inclination
to
become
a
novice
and
this
man
as
i
have
said
began
to
show
himself
to
me
with
a
tremendous
frankness
domini
he
was
suffering
under
what
i
suppose
would
be
called
an
obsession
an
immense
domination
such
as
one
human
being
sometimes
obtains
over
another
at
that
time
i
had
never
realised
that
there
were
such
dominations
now
i
know
that
there
are
and
domini
that
they
can
be
both
terrible
and
splendid
he
was
dominated
by
a
woman
by
a
woman
who
had
come
into
his
life
seized
it
made
it
a
thing
of
glory
broken
it
he
described
to
me
the
dominion
of
this
woman
he
told
me
how
she
had
transformed
him
till
he
met
her
he
had
been
passionate
but
free
his
own
master
through
many
experiences
many
intrigues
he
was
very
frank
domini
he
did
not
attempt
to
hide
from
me
that
his
life
had
been
evil
it
had
been
a
life
devoted
to
the
acquiring
of
experience
of
all
possible
experience
mental
and
bodily
i
gathered
that
he
had
shrunk
from
nothing
avoided
nothing
his
nature
had
prompted
him
to
rush
upon
everything
to
grasp
at
everything
at
first
i
was
horrified
at
what
he
told
me
i
showed
it
i
remember
the
second
evening
after
his
arrival
we
were
sitting
together
in
a
little
arbour
at
the
foot
of
the
vineyard
that
sloped
up
to
the
cemetery
it
was
half
an
hour
before
the
last
service
in
the
chapel
the
air
was
cool
with
breath
from
the
distant
sea
an
intense
calm
a
heavenly
calm
i
think
filled
the
garden
floated
away
to
the
cypresses
beside
the
graves
along
the
avenue
where
stood
the
fourteen
stations
of
the
cross
and
he
told
me
began
to
tell
me
something
of
his
life
you
thought
to
find
happiness
in
such
an
existence
i
exclaimed
almost
with
incredulity
i
believe
he
looked
at
me
with
his
shining
eyes
why
not
father
do
you
think
i
was
a
madman
to
do
so
why
is
there
not
happiness
in
knowledge
knowledge
of
evil
knowledge
of
all
things
that
exist
in
life
i
have
never
sought
for
evil
specially
i
have
sought
for
everything
i
wished
to
bring
everything
under
my
observation
everything
connected
with
human
but
human
life
i
said
more
quietly
passes
away
from
this
world
it
is
a
shadow
in
a
world
of
you
say
that
he
answered
abruptly
i
wonder
if
you
feel
it
feel
it
as
you
feel
my
hand
on
he
laid
his
hand
on
mine
it
was
hot
and
dry
as
if
with
fever
its
touch
affected
me
painfully
is
that
hand
the
hand
of
a
shadow
he
said
is
this
body
that
can
enjoy
and
suffer
that
can
be
in
heaven
or
in
hell
here
here
a
shadow
within
a
week
it
might
be
less
than
a
and
what
of
that
this
is
now
this
is
now
do
you
mean
what
you
say
do
you
truly
feel
that
you
are
a
shadow
that
this
garden
is
but
a
world
of
shadows
i
feel
that
i
that
you
are
terrific
realities
that
this
garden
is
of
immense
significance
look
at
that
the
sky
above
the
cypresses
was
red
with
sunset
the
trees
looked
black
beneath
it
fireflies
were
flitting
near
the
arbour
where
we
sat
that
is
the
sky
that
roofs
what
you
would
have
me
believe
a
world
of
shadows
it
is
like
the
blood
the
hot
blood
that
flows
and
surges
in
the
veins
of
men
in
our
veins
ah
but
you
are
a
monk
the
way
he
said
the
last
words
made
me
feel
suddenly
a
sense
of
shame
domini
it
was
as
if
a
man
said
to
another
man
you
are
not
a
can
you
can
you
understand
the
feeling
i
had
just
then
something
hot
and
bitter
was
in
me
a
sort
of
desperate
sense
of
nothingness
came
over
me
as
if
i
were
a
skeleton
sitting
there
with
flesh
and
blood
and
trying
to
believe
and
to
make
it
believe
that
i
too
was
and
had
been
flesh
and
blood
yes
thank
god
i
am
a
monk
i
answered
quietly
something
in
my
tone
i
think
made
him
feel
that
he
had
been
brutal
i
am
a
brute
and
a
fool
he
said
vehemently
but
it
is
always
so
with
me
i
always
feel
as
if
what
i
want
others
must
want
i
always
feel
universal
it
s
folly
you
have
your
vocation
i
mine
yours
is
to
pray
mine
is
to
again
i
was
conscious
of
the
bitterness
i
tried
to
put
it
from
me
prayer
is
life
i
answered
to
me
to
us
who
are
prayer
can
it
be
can
it
be
vivid
as
the
life
of
experience
as
the
life
that
teaches
one
the
truth
of
men
and
women
the
truth
of
creation
joy
sorrow
aspiration
lust
ambition
of
the
intellect
and
the
limbs
prayer
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
i
said
are
you
coming
to
the
chapel
yes
he
answered
almost
eagerly
i
shall
look
down
on
you
from
my
lonely
gallery
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
feel
the
life
of
may
it
be
so
i
said
but
i
think
i
spoke
without
confidence
and
i
know
that
that
evening
i
prayed
without
impulse
coldly
mechanically
the
long
dim
chapel
with
its
lines
of
monks
facing
each
other
in
their
stalls
seemed
to
me
a
sad
place
like
a
valley
of
dry
bones
for
the
first
time
for
the
first
time
i
ought
to
have
gone
on
the
morrow
to
the
reverend
pere
i
ought
to
have
asked
him
begged
him
to
remove
me
from
the
i
ought
to
have
foreseen
what
was
coming
that
this
man
had
a
strength
to
live
greater
than
my
strength
to
pray
that
his
strength
might
overcome
mine
i
began
to
sin
that
night
curiosity
was
alive
in
me
curiosity
about
the
life
that
i
had
never
known
was
so
i
believed
so
i
thought
i
knew
never
to
know
when
i
came
out
of
the
chapel
into
the
i
met
our
guest
i
do
not
say
his
name
what
would
be
the
use
in
the
corridor
it
was
almost
dark
there
were
ten
minutes
before
the
time
for
locking
up
the
door
and
going
to
bed
francois
the
servant
was
asleep
under
the
arcade
shall
we
go
on
to
the
path
and
have
a
last
breath
of
air
the
stranger
said
we
stepped
out
and
walked
slowly
up
and
down
do
you
not
feel
the
beauty
of
peace
i
asked
i
wanted
him
to
say
yes
i
wanted
him
to
tell
me
that
peace
tranquillity
were
beautiful
he
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
i
heard
him
sigh
heavily
if
there
is
peace
in
the
world
at
all
he
said
at
length
it
is
only
to
be
found
with
the
human
being
one
loves
with
the
human
being
one
loves
one
might
find
peace
in
we
did
not
speak
again
before
we
parted
for
the
night
domini
i
did
not
sleep
at
all
that
night
it
was
the
first
of
many
sleepless
nights
nights
in
which
my
thoughts
travelled
like
winged
furies
horrible
horrible
nights
in
them
i
strove
to
imagine
all
the
stranger
knew
by
experience
it
was
like
a
ghastly
physical
effort
i
strove
to
conceive
of
all
that
he
had
done
with
the
view
i
told
myself
at
first
of
bringing
myself
to
a
greater
contentment
of
realising
how
worthless
was
all
that
i
had
rejected
and
that
he
had
grasped
at
in
the
dark
i
as
it
were
spread
out
his
map
of
life
and
mine
and
examined
them
when
still
in
the
dark
i
rose
to
go
to
the
chapel
i
was
exhausted
i
felt
unutterably
melancholy
that
was
at
first
presently
i
felt
an
active
gnawing
hunger
but
but
i
have
not
come
to
that
yet
this
strange
new
melancholy
was
the
forerunner
it
was
a
melancholy
that
seemed
to
be
caused
by
a
sense
of
frightful
loneliness
such
as
i
had
never
previously
experienced
till
now
i
had
almost
always
felt
god
with
me
and
that
he
was
enough
now
suddenly
i
began
to
feel
that
i
was
alone
i
kept
thinking
of
the
stranger
s
words
if
there
is
peace
in
the
world
at
all
it
is
only
to
be
found
with
the
human
being
one
that
is
false
i
said
to
myself
again
and
again
peace
is
only
to
be
found
by
close
union
with
god
in
that
i
have
found
peace
for
many
many
i
knew
that
i
had
been
at
peace
i
knew
that
i
had
been
happy
and
yet
when
i
looked
back
upon
my
life
as
a
novice
and
a
monk
i
now
felt
as
if
i
had
been
happy
vaguely
foolishly
bloodlessly
happy
only
because
i
had
been
ignorant
of
what
real
happiness
was
not
really
happy
i
thought
of
a
bird
born
in
a
cage
and
singing
there
i
had
been
as
that
bird
and
then
when
i
was
in
the
garden
i
looked
at
the
swallows
winging
their
way
high
in
the
sunshine
between
the
garden
trees
and
the
radiant
blue
winging
their
way
towards
sea
and
mountains
and
plains
and
that
bitterness
like
an
acid
that
burns
and
eats
away
fine
metal
was
once
more
at
my
heart
but
the
sensation
of
loneliness
was
the
most
terrible
of
all
i
compared
union
with
god
such
as
i
thought
i
had
known
with
that
other
union
spoken
of
by
my
guest
union
with
the
human
being
one
loves
i
set
the
two
unions
as
it
were
in
comparison
night
after
night
i
did
this
night
after
night
i
told
over
the
joys
of
union
with
god
joys
which
i
dared
to
think
i
had
known
and
the
joys
of
union
with
a
loved
human
being
on
the
one
side
i
thought
of
the
drawing
near
to
god
in
prayer
of
the
sensation
of
approach
that
comes
with
earnest
prayer
of
the
feeling
that
ears
are
listening
to
you
that
the
great
heart
is
loving
you
the
great
heart
that
loves
all
living
things
that
you
are
being
absolutely
understood
that
all
you
can
not
say
is
comprehended
and
all
you
say
is
received
as
something
precious
i
recalled
the
joy
the
exaltation
that
i
had
known
when
i
prayed
that
was
union
with
god
in
such
union
i
had
sometimes
felt
that
the
world
with
all
that
it
contained
of
wickedness
suffering
and
death
was
utterly
devoid
of
power
to
sadden
or
alarm
the
humblest
human
being
who
was
able
to
draw
near
to
god
i
had
had
a
conquering
feeling
not
proud
as
of
one
upborne
protected
for
ever
lifted
to
a
region
in
which
no
enemy
could
ever
be
no
sadness
no
faint
anxiety
even
then
i
strove
to
imagine
and
this
domini
was
surely
a
deliberate
sin
exactly
what
it
must
be
to
be
united
with
a
beloved
human
being
i
strove
and
i
was
able
for
not
only
did
instinct
help
me
instinct
that
had
been
long
asleep
but
i
have
told
you
that
the
stranger
was
suffering
under
an
obsession
a
terrible
dominion
this
dominion
he
described
to
me
with
an
openness
that
perhaps
that
indeed
i
believe
he
would
not
have
shown
had
i
not
been
a
monk
he
looked
upon
me
as
a
being
apart
neither
man
nor
woman
a
being
without
sex
i
am
sure
he
did
and
yet
he
was
immensely
intelligent
but
he
knew
that
i
had
entered
the
monastery
as
a
novice
that
i
had
been
there
through
all
my
adult
life
and
then
my
manner
probably
assisted
him
in
his
illusion
for
i
gave
i
believe
no
sign
of
the
change
that
was
taking
place
within
me
under
his
influence
i
seemed
to
be
calm
detached
even
in
my
sympathy
for
his
suffering
for
he
suffered
frightfully
this
woman
he
loved
was
a
parisian
he
told
me
he
described
her
beauty
to
me
as
if
in
order
to
excuse
himself
for
having
become
the
slave
to
her
he
was
i
suppose
she
was
very
beautiful
he
said
that
she
had
a
physical
charm
so
intense
that
few
men
could
resist
it
that
she
was
famous
throughout
europe
for
it
he
told
me
that
she
was
not
a
good
woman
i
gathered
that
she
lived
for
pleasure
admiration
that
she
had
allowed
many
men
to
love
her
before
he
knew
her
but
she
had
loved
him
genuinely
she
was
not
a
very
young
woman
and
she
was
not
a
married
woman
he
said
that
she
was
a
woman
men
loved
but
did
not
marry
a
woman
who
was
loved
by
the
husbands
of
married
women
a
woman
to
marry
whom
would
exclude
a
man
from
the
society
of
good
women
she
had
never
lived
or
thought
of
living
for
one
man
till
he
came
into
her
life
nor
had
he
ever
dreamed
of
living
for
one
woman
he
had
lived
to
gain
experience
she
too
but
when
he
met
her
knowing
thoroughly
all
she
was
all
other
women
ceased
to
exist
for
him
he
became
her
slave
then
jealousy
awoke
in
him
jealousy
of
all
the
men
who
had
been
in
her
life
who
might
be
in
her
life
again
he
was
tortured
by
loving
such
a
woman
a
woman
who
had
belonged
to
many
who
would
no
doubt
in
the
future
belong
to
others
for
despite
the
fact
that
she
loved
him
he
told
me
that
at
first
he
had
no
illusions
about
her
he
knew
the
world
too
well
for
that
and
he
cursed
the
fate
that
had
bound
him
body
and
soul
to
what
he
called
a
courtesan
even
the
fact
that
she
loved
him
at
first
did
not
blind
him
to
the
effect
upon
character
that
her
life
must
inevitably
have
had
she
had
dwelt
in
an
atmosphere
of
lies
he
said
and
to
lie
was
nothing
to
her
any
original
refinement
of
feeling
as
regards
human
relations
that
she
might
have
had
had
become
dulled
if
it
had
not
been
destroyed
at
first
he
blindly
miserably
resigned
himself
to
this
he
said
to
himself
fate
has
led
me
to
love
this
sort
of
woman
i
must
accept
her
as
she
is
with
all
her
defects
with
her
instinct
for
treachery
with
her
passion
for
the
admiration
of
the
world
with
her
incapability
for
being
true
to
an
ideal
or
for
isolating
herself
in
the
adoration
of
one
man
i
can
not
get
away
from
her
she
has
me
fast
i
can
not
live
without
her
then
i
must
bear
the
torture
that
jealousy
of
her
will
certainly
bring
me
in
silence
i
must
conceal
it
i
must
try
to
kill
it
i
must
make
the
best
of
whatever
she
will
give
me
knowing
that
she
can
never
with
her
nature
and
her
training
be
exclusively
mine
as
a
good
woman
might
this
he
said
to
himself
this
plan
of
conduct
he
traced
for
himself
but
he
soon
found
that
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
keep
to
it
his
jealousy
was
a
devouring
fire
and
he
could
not
conceal
it
domini
he
described
to
me
minutely
the
effect
of
jealousy
in
a
human
heart
i
had
never
imagined
what
it
was
and
when
he
described
it
i
felt
as
if
i
looked
down
into
a
bottomless
pit
lined
with
the
flames
of
hell
by
the
depth
of
that
pit
i
measured
the
depth
of
his
passion
for
this
woman
and
i
gained
an
idea
of
what
human
love
not
the
best
sort
of
human
love
but
still
genuine
intense
love
of
some
kind
could
be
of
this
human
love
i
thought
at
night
putting
it
in
comparison
with
the
love
god
s
creature
can
have
for
god
and
my
sense
of
loneliness
increased
and
i
felt
as
if
i
had
always
been
lonely
does
this
seem
strange
to
you
in
the
love
of
god
was
calm
peace
rest
a
lying
down
of
the
soul
in
the
almighty
arms
in
the
other
love
described
to
me
was
restlessness
agitation
torture
the
soul
spinning
like
an
atom
driven
by
winds
the
heart
devoured
as
by
a
disease
a
cancer
on
the
one
hand
was
a
beautiful
trust
on
the
other
a
ceaseless
agony
of
doubt
and
terror
and
yet
i
came
to
feel
as
if
the
one
were
unreal
in
comparison
with
the
other
as
if
in
the
one
were
a
loneliness
in
the
other
fierce
companionship
i
thought
of
the
almighty
arms
domini
and
of
the
arms
of
a
woman
and
domini
i
longed
to
have
known
if
only
once
the
pressure
of
a
woman
s
arms
about
my
neck
about
my
breast
the
touch
of
a
woman
s
hand
upon
my
heart
and
of
all
this
i
never
spoke
at
confession
i
committed
the
deadly
sin
of
keeping
back
at
confession
all
he
stopped
then
he
said
till
the
end
my
confessions
were
incomplete
were
false
the
stranger
told
me
that
as
his
love
for
this
woman
grew
he
found
it
impossible
to
follow
the
plan
he
had
traced
for
himself
of
shutting
his
eyes
to
the
sight
of
other
eyes
admiring
desiring
her
of
shutting
his
ears
to
the
voices
that
whispered
this
it
will
always
be
for
others
as
well
as
for
he
found
it
impossible
his
jealousy
was
too
importunate
and
he
resolved
to
make
any
effort
to
keep
her
for
himself
alone
he
knew
she
had
love
for
him
but
he
knew
that
love
would
not
necessarily
or
even
probably
keep
her
entirely
faithful
to
him
she
thought
too
little
of
passing
intrigues
to
her
they
seemed
trifles
meaningless
unimportant
she
told
him
so
when
he
spoke
his
jealousy
she
said
i
love
you
i
do
not
love
these
other
men
they
are
in
my
life
for
a
moment
and
that
moment
plunges
me
into
hell
he
said
he
told
her
he
could
not
bear
it
that
it
was
impossible
that
she
must
belong
to
him
entirely
and
solely
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
she
was
surprised
touched
she
understood
what
a
sacrifice
such
a
marriage
would
be
to
a
man
in
his
position
he
was
a
man
of
good
birth
his
request
his
vehement
insistence
on
it
made
her
understand
his
love
as
she
had
not
understood
it
before
yet
she
hesitated
for
so
long
had
she
been
accustomed
to
a
life
of
freedom
of
changing
that
she
hesitated
to
put
her
neck
under
the
yoke
of
matrimony
she
understood
thoroughly
his
character
and
his
aim
in
marrying
her
she
knew
that
as
his
wife
she
must
bid
an
eternal
farewell
to
the
life
she
had
known
and
it
was
a
life
that
had
become
a
habit
to
her
a
life
that
she
was
fond
of
for
she
was
enormously
vain
and
she
was
a
she
was
a
very
physical
woman
subject
to
physical
caprices
there
are
things
that
i
pass
over
domini
which
would
explain
still
more
her
hesitation
he
knew
what
caused
it
and
again
he
was
tortured
but
he
persisted
and
at
last
he
overcame
she
consented
to
marry
him
they
were
engaged
domini
i
need
not
tell
you
much
more
only
this
fact
which
had
driven
him
from
france
destroyed
his
happiness
brought
him
to
the
monastery
shortly
before
the
marriage
was
to
take
place
he
discovered
that
while
they
were
engaged
she
had
yielded
to
the
desires
of
an
old
admirer
who
had
come
to
bid
her
farewell
and
to
wish
her
joy
in
her
new
life
he
was
tempted
he
said
to
kill
her
but
he
governed
himself
and
left
her
he
travelled
he
came
to
tunis
he
came
to
la
trappe
he
saw
the
peace
there
he
thought
can
i
seize
it
can
it
do
something
for
me
he
saw
me
he
thought
i
shall
not
be
quite
alone
this
monk
he
has
lived
always
in
peace
he
has
never
known
the
torture
of
women
might
not
intercourse
with
him
help
me
such
was
his
history
such
was
the
history
poured
with
infinite
detail
that
i
have
not
told
you
day
by
day
into
my
ears
it
was
the
history
you
see
of
a
passion
that
was
mainly
physical
i
will
not
say
entirely
i
do
not
know
whether
any
great
passion
can
be
entirely
physical
but
it
was
the
history
of
the
passion
of
one
body
for
another
body
and
he
did
not
attempt
to
present
it
to
me
as
anything
else
this
man
made
me
understand
the
meaning
of
the
body
i
had
never
understood
it
before
i
had
never
suspected
the
immensity
of
the
meaning
there
is
in
physical
things
i
had
never
comprehended
the
flesh
now
i
comprehended
it
loneliness
rushed
upon
me
devoured
me
loneliness
of
the
body
god
is
a
spirit
and
those
that
worship
him
must
worship
him
in
now
i
felt
that
to
worship
in
spirit
was
not
enough
i
even
felt
that
it
was
scarcely
anything
again
i
thought
of
my
life
as
the
life
of
a
skeleton
in
a
world
of
skeletons
again
the
chapel
was
as
a
valley
of
dry
bones
it
was
a
ghastly
sensation
i
was
plunged
in
the
void
i
i
i
can
t
tell
you
my
exact
sensation
but
it
was
as
if
i
was
the
loneliest
creature
in
the
whole
of
the
universe
and
as
if
i
need
not
have
been
lonely
as
if
i
in
my
ignorance
and
fatuity
had
selected
loneliness
thinking
it
was
the
happiest
fate
and
yet
you
will
say
i
was
face
to
face
with
this
man
s
almost
frantic
misery
i
was
and
it
made
no
difference
i
envied
him
even
in
his
present
state
he
wanted
to
gain
consolation
from
me
if
that
were
possible
oh
the
irony
of
my
consoling
him
in
secret
i
laughed
at
it
bitterly
when
i
strove
to
console
him
i
knew
that
i
was
an
incarnate
lie
he
had
told
me
the
meaning
of
the
body
and
by
so
doing
had
snatched
from
me
the
meaning
of
the
spirit
and
then
he
said
to
me
make
me
feel
the
meaning
of
the
spirit
if
i
can
grasp
that
i
may
find
he
called
upon
me
to
give
him
what
i
no
longer
had
the
peace
of
god
that
passeth
understanding
domini
can
you
feel
at
all
what
that
was
to
me
can
you
realise
can
you
is
it
any
wonder
that
i
could
do
nothing
for
him
for
him
who
had
done
such
a
frightful
thing
for
me
is
it
any
wonder
soon
he
realised
that
he
would
not
find
peace
with
me
in
the
garden
yet
he
stayed
on
why
he
did
not
know
where
to
go
what
to
do
life
offered
him
nothing
but
horror
his
love
of
experiences
was
dead
his
love
of
life
had
completely
vanished
he
saw
the
worldly
life
as
a
nightmare
yet
he
had
nothing
to
put
in
the
place
of
it
and
in
the
monastery
he
was
ceaselessly
tormented
by
jealousy
ceaselessly
his
mind
was
at
work
about
this
woman
picturing
her
in
her
life
of
change
of
intrigue
of
new
lovers
of
new
hopes
and
aims
in
which
he
had
no
part
in
which
his
image
was
being
blotted
out
doubtless
from
her
memory
even
he
suffered
he
suffered
as
few
suffer
but
i
think
i
suffered
more
the
melancholy
was
driven
on
into
a
gnawing
hunger
the
gnawing
hunger
of
the
flesh
wishing
to
have
lived
wishing
to
live
wishing
to
to
know
domini
to
you
i
can
t
say
more
of
that
to
you
whom
i
whom
i
love
with
spirit
and
flesh
i
will
come
to
the
end
to
the
incident
which
made
the
body
rise
up
strike
down
the
soul
trample
out
over
it
into
the
world
like
a
wolf
that
was
starving
one
day
the
reverend
pere
gave
me
a
special
permission
to
walk
with
our
visitor
beyond
the
monastery
walls
towards
the
sea
such
permission
was
an
event
in
my
life
it
excited
me
more
than
you
can
imagine
i
found
that
the
stranger
had
begged
him
to
let
me
come
our
guest
is
very
fond
of
you
the
reverend
pere
said
to
me
i
think
if
any
human
being
can
bring
him
to
a
calmer
happier
state
of
mind
and
spirit
you
can
you
have
obtained
a
good
influence
over
domini
when
the
reverend
pere
spoke
to
me
thus
my
mouth
was
suddenly
contracted
in
a
smile
devil
s
smile
i
think
i
put
up
my
hand
to
my
face
i
saw
the
reverend
pere
looking
at
me
with
a
dawning
of
astonishment
in
his
kind
grave
eyes
and
i
controlled
myself
at
once
but
i
said
nothing
i
could
not
say
anything
and
i
went
out
from
the
parlour
quickly
hot
with
a
sensation
of
shame
you
are
coming
the
stranger
said
yes
i
answered
it
was
a
fiery
day
of
late
june
africa
was
bathed
in
a
glare
of
light
that
hurt
the
eyes
i
went
into
my
cell
and
put
on
a
pair
of
blue
glasses
and
my
wide
straw
hat
the
hat
in
which
i
formerly
used
to
work
in
the
fields
when
i
came
out
my
guest
was
standing
on
the
garden
path
he
was
swinging
a
stick
in
one
hand
the
other
hand
which
hung
down
by
his
side
was
twitching
nervously
in
the
glitter
of
the
sun
his
face
looked
ghastly
in
his
eyes
there
seemed
to
be
terrors
watching
without
hope
you
are
ready
he
said
let
us
we
set
off
walking
quickly
movement
pace
sometimes
that
does
a
little
good
he
said
if
one
can
exhaust
the
body
the
mind
sometimes
lies
almost
still
for
a
moment
if
it
would
only
lie
still
for
i
said
nothing
i
could
say
nothing
for
my
fever
was
surely
as
his
fever
where
are
we
going
he
asked
when
we
reached
the
little
house
of
the
keeper
of
the
gate
by
the
cemetery
we
can
not
walk
in
the
sun
i
answered
let
us
go
into
the
eucalyptus
the
first
trappists
had
planted
forests
of
eucalyptus
to
keep
off
the
fever
that
sometimes
comes
in
the
african
summer
we
made
our
way
along
a
tract
of
open
land
and
came
into
a
deep
wood
here
we
began
to
walk
more
slowly
the
wood
was
empty
of
men
the
hot
silence
was
profound
he
took
off
his
white
helmet
and
walked
on
carrying
it
in
his
hand
not
till
we
were
far
in
the
forest
did
he
speak
then
he
said
father
i
can
not
struggle
on
much
he
spoke
abruptly
in
a
hard
voice
you
must
try
to
gain
courage
i
said
from
where
he
exclaimed
no
no
don
t
say
from
god
if
there
is
a
god
he
hates
when
he
said
that
i
felt
as
if
my
soul
shuddered
hearing
a
frightful
truth
spoken
about
itself
my
lips
were
dry
my
heart
seemed
to
shrivel
up
but
i
made
an
effort
and
answered
god
hates
no
being
whom
he
has
how
can
you
know
almost
every
man
perhaps
every
living
man
hates
someone
why
not
to
compare
god
with
a
man
is
blasphemous
i
answered
aren
t
we
made
in
his
image
father
it
s
as
i
said
i
can
t
struggle
on
much
longer
i
shall
have
to
end
it
i
wish
now
i
often
wish
that
i
had
yielded
to
my
first
impulse
and
killed
her
what
is
she
doing
now
what
is
she
doing
now
at
this
moment
he
stood
still
and
beat
with
his
stick
on
the
ground
you
don
t
know
the
infinite
torture
there
is
in
knowing
that
far
away
she
is
still
living
that
cursed
life
that
she
is
free
to
continue
the
acts
of
which
her
existence
has
been
full
every
moment
i
am
imagining
i
am
seeing
he
forced
his
stick
deep
into
the
ground
if
i
had
killed
her
he
said
in
a
low
voice
at
least
i
should
know
that
she
was
sleeping
alone
there
there
under
the
earth
i
should
know
that
her
body
was
dissolved
into
dust
that
her
lips
could
kiss
no
man
that
her
arms
could
never
hold
another
as
they
have
held
me
hush
i
said
sternly
you
deliberately
torture
yourself
and
he
glanced
up
sharply
you
what
do
you
mean
i
must
not
listen
to
such
things
i
said
they
are
bad
for
you
and
for
how
can
they
be
bad
for
you
a
monk
such
talk
is
evil
evil
for
i
ll
be
silent
then
i
ll
go
into
the
silence
i
ll
go
i
understood
that
he
thought
of
putting
an
end
to
himself
there
are
few
men
i
said
speaking
with
deliberation
with
effort
who
do
not
feel
at
some
period
of
life
that
all
is
over
for
them
that
there
is
nothing
to
hope
for
that
happiness
is
a
dream
which
will
visit
them
no
have
you
ever
felt
like
that
you
speak
of
it
calmly
but
have
you
ever
experienced
it
i
hesitated
then
i
said
you
who
have
been
a
monk
for
so
many
years
since
you
have
been
here
yes
since
and
you
would
tell
me
that
the
feeling
passed
that
hope
came
again
and
the
dream
as
you
call
it
i
would
say
that
what
has
lived
in
a
heart
can
die
as
we
who
live
in
this
world
shall
ah
that
the
sooner
the
better
but
you
are
wrong
sometimes
a
thing
lives
in
the
heart
that
can
not
die
so
long
as
the
heart
beats
such
is
my
passion
my
torture
don
t
you
a
monk
don
t
dare
to
say
to
me
that
this
love
of
mine
could
don
t
you
wish
it
to
die
i
asked
you
say
it
tortures
yes
but
no
no
i
don
t
wish
it
to
die
i
could
never
wish
i
looked
at
him
i
believe
with
a
deep
astonishment
ah
you
don
t
understand
he
said
you
don
t
understand
at
all
costs
one
must
keep
it
one
s
love
with
it
i
am
as
you
see
but
without
it
man
without
it
i
should
be
nothing
no
more
than
he
picked
up
a
rotten
leaf
held
it
to
me
threw
it
down
on
the
ground
i
hardly
looked
at
it
he
had
said
to
me
man
that
word
thus
said
by
him
seemed
to
me
to
mark
the
enormous
change
in
me
to
indicate
that
it
was
visible
to
the
eyes
of
another
the
heart
of
another
i
had
passed
from
the
monk
the
sexless
being
to
the
man
he
set
me
beside
himself
spoke
of
me
as
if
i
were
as
himself
an
intense
excitement
surged
up
in
me
i
think
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
have
said
done
but
at
that
moment
a
boy
who
acted
as
a
servant
at
the
monastery
came
running
towards
us
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
it
is
for
monsieur
he
said
it
was
left
at
the
a
letter
for
me
the
stranger
said
he
held
out
his
hand
and
took
it
indifferently
the
boy
gave
it
and
turning
went
away
through
the
wood
then
the
stranger
glanced
at
the
envelope
domini
i
wish
i
could
make
you
see
what
i
saw
then
the
change
that
came
i
can
t
there
are
things
the
eyes
must
see
the
tongue
can
t
tell
them
the
ghastly
whiteness
went
out
of
his
face
a
hot
flood
of
scarlet
rushed
over
it
up
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
his
hands
and
his
whole
body
began
to
tremble
violently
his
eyes
which
were
fixed
on
the
envelope
shone
with
an
expression
it
was
like
all
the
excitement
in
the
world
condensed
into
two
sparks
he
dropped
his
stick
and
sat
down
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
fell
down
almost
father
he
muttered
it
s
not
been
through
the
post
it
s
not
been
through
the
post
i
did
not
understand
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
what
the
flush
left
his
face
he
turned
deadly
white
again
he
held
out
the
letter
read
it
for
me
he
said
i
can
t
see
i
can
t
see
i
took
the
letter
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
i
opened
it
and
read
grand
hotel
tunis
i
have
found
out
where
you
are
i
have
come
forgive
me
if
you
can
i
will
marry
you
or
i
will
live
with
you
as
you
please
but
i
can
not
live
without
you
i
know
women
are
not
admitted
to
the
monastery
come
out
on
the
road
that
leads
to
tunis
i
am
there
at
least
come
for
a
moment
and
speak
to
me
domini
i
read
this
slowly
and
it
was
as
if
i
read
my
own
fate
when
i
had
finished
he
got
up
he
was
still
pale
as
ashes
and
trembling
which
is
the
way
to
the
road
he
said
do
you
know
take
me
there
give
me
your
arm
he
took
it
leaned
on
it
heavily
we
walked
through
the
wood
towards
the
highroad
i
had
almost
to
support
him
the
way
seemed
long
i
felt
tired
sick
as
if
i
could
scarcely
move
as
if
i
were
bearing
as
if
i
were
bearing
a
cross
that
was
too
heavy
for
me
we
came
at
last
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
trees
into
the
glare
of
the
sun
a
flat
field
divided
us
from
the
white
road
is
there
is
there
a
carriage
he
whispered
in
my
ear
i
looked
across
the
field
and
saw
on
the
road
a
carriage
waiting
yes
i
said
i
stopped
and
tried
to
take
his
arm
from
mine
go
i
said
go
on
i
can
t
come
with
me
we
went
on
in
the
blinding
sun
i
looked
down
on
the
dry
earth
as
i
walked
presently
i
saw
at
my
feet
the
white
dust
of
the
road
at
the
same
time
i
heard
a
woman
s
cry
the
stranger
took
his
arm
violently
from
mine
father
he
said
god
bless
you
he
was
gone
i
stood
there
in
a
moment
i
heard
a
roll
of
wheels
then
i
looked
up
i
saw
a
man
and
a
woman
together
domini
their
faces
were
like
angels
faces
with
happiness
the
dust
flew
up
in
the
sunshine
the
wheels
died
away
i
was
alone
presently
i
think
after
a
very
long
time
i
turned
and
went
back
to
the
monastery
domini
that
night
i
left
the
monastery
i
was
as
one
mad
the
wish
to
live
had
given
place
to
the
determination
to
live
i
thought
of
nothing
else
in
the
chapel
that
evening
i
heard
nothing
i
did
not
see
the
monks
i
did
not
attempt
to
pray
for
i
knew
that
i
was
going
to
go
was
an
easy
matter
for
me
i
slept
alone
in
the
of
which
i
had
the
key
when
it
was
night
i
unlocked
the
door
i
walked
to
the
cemetery
between
the
stations
of
the
cross
domini
i
did
not
see
them
in
the
cemetery
was
a
ladder
as
i
told
you
just
before
dawn
i
reached
my
brother
s
house
outside
of
tunis
not
far
from
the
bardo
i
knocked
my
brother
himself
came
down
to
know
who
was
there
he
as
i
told
you
was
without
religion
and
had
always
hated
my
being
a
monk
i
told
him
all
without
reserve
i
said
help
me
to
go
away
let
me
go
anywhere
he
gave
me
clothes
money
i
shaved
off
my
beard
and
moustache
i
shaved
my
head
so
that
the
tonsure
was
no
longer
visible
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
i
left
tunis
i
was
let
loose
into
life
domini
domini
i
won
t
tell
you
where
i
wandered
till
i
came
to
the
desert
till
i
met
you
i
was
let
loose
into
life
but
with
my
freedom
the
wish
to
live
seemed
to
die
in
me
i
was
afraid
of
life
i
was
haunted
by
terrors
i
had
been
a
monk
so
long
that
i
did
not
know
how
to
live
as
other
men
i
did
not
live
i
never
lived
till
i
met
you
and
then
then
i
realised
what
life
may
be
and
then
too
i
realised
fully
what
i
was
i
struggled
i
fought
myself
you
know
now
if
you
look
back
i
think
you
know
that
i
tried
sometimes
often
i
tried
to
to
i
tried
to
his
voice
broke
that
last
day
in
the
garden
i
thought
that
i
had
conquered
myself
and
it
was
in
that
moment
that
i
fell
for
ever
when
i
knew
you
loved
me
i
could
fight
no
more
do
you
understand
you
have
seen
me
you
have
lived
with
me
you
have
divined
my
misery
but
don
t
don
t
think
domini
that
it
ever
came
from
you
it
was
the
consciousness
of
my
lie
to
you
my
lie
to
god
that
that
i
can
t
go
on
i
can
t
tell
you
i
can
t
tell
you
you
he
was
silent
domini
said
nothing
did
not
move
he
did
not
look
at
her
but
her
silence
seemed
to
terrify
him
he
drew
back
from
it
sharply
and
turned
to
the
desert
he
stared
across
the
vast
spaces
lit
up
by
the
moon
still
she
did
not
move
i
ll
go
i
ll
go
he
muttered
and
he
stepped
forward
then
domini
spoke
boris
she
said
he
stopped
what
is
it
he
murmured
hoarsely
boris
now
at
last
you
you
can
he
looked
at
her
as
if
pray
he
whispered
you
tell
me
i
can
pray
now
now
at
she
went
into
the
tent
and
left
him
alone
he
stood
where
he
was
for
a
moment
he
knew
that
in
the
tent
she
was
praying
he
stood
trying
to
listen
to
her
prayer
then
with
an
uncertain
hand
he
felt
in
his
breast
he
drew
out
the
wooden
crucifix
he
bent
down
his
head
touched
it
with
his
lips
and
fell
upon
his
knees
in
the
desert
the
music
had
ceased
in
the
city
there
was
a
great
silence

xxvii
the
good
priest
of
amara
strolling
by
chance
at
the
of
the
following
day
towards
the
camp
of
the
hospitable
strangers
was
surprised
and
saddened
to
find
only
the
strewn
with
debris
the
tents
the
camels
the
mules
the
horses
all
were
gone
no
servants
greeted
him
no
cook
was
busy
no
kind
hostess
bade
him
come
in
and
stay
to
dine
forlornly
he
glanced
around
and
made
inquiry
an
arab
told
him
that
in
the
morning
the
camp
had
been
struck
and
ere
noon
was
far
on
its
way
towards
the
north
the
priest
had
been
on
horseback
to
an
neighbouring
oasis
so
had
heard
nothing
of
this
flitting
he
asked
its
explanation
and
was
told
a
hundred
lies
the
one
most
often
repeated
was
to
the
effect
that
monsieur
the
husband
of
madame
was
overcome
by
the
heat
and
that
for
this
reason
the
travellers
were
making
their
way
towards
the
cooler
climate
that
lay
beyond
the
desert
as
he
heard
this
a
sensation
of
loneliness
came
to
the
priest
his
usually
cheerful
countenance
was
overcast
with
gloom
for
a
moment
he
loathed
his
fate
in
the
sands
and
sighed
for
the
fleshpots
of
civilisation
with
his
white
umbrella
spread
above
his
helmet
he
stood
still
and
gazed
towards
the
north
across
the
vast
spaces
that
were
in
the
sunset
he
fancied
that
on
the
horizon
he
saw
faintly
a
cloud
of
sand
grains
whirling
and
imagined
it
stirred
up
by
the
strangers
caravan
then
he
thought
of
the
rich
lands
of
the
tell
of
the
olive
groves
of
tunis
of
the
blue
mediterranean
of
france
his
country
which
he
had
not
seen
for
many
years
he
sighed
profoundly
happy
people
he
thought
to
himself
rich
free
able
to
do
as
they
like
to
go
where
they
will
why
was
i
born
to
live
in
the
sand
and
to
be
alone
he
was
moved
by
envy
but
then
he
remembered
his
intercourse
with
androvsky
on
the
previous
day
after
all
he
thought
more
comfortably
he
did
not
look
a
happy
man
and
he
took
himself
to
task
for
his
sin
of
envy
and
strolled
to
the
inn
by
the
fountain
where
he
paid
his
pension
the
same
day
in
the
house
of
the
marabout
of
count
anteoni
received
a
letter
brought
from
amara
by
an
arab
it
was
as
follows
amara
my
dear
friend
we
are
just
leaving
i
had
expected
to
be
here
longer
but
we
must
go
we
are
returning
to
the
north
and
shall
not
penetrate
farther
into
the
desert
i
shall
think
of
you
and
of
your
journey
on
among
the
people
of
your
faith
you
said
to
me
when
we
sat
in
the
tent
door
that
now
you
could
pray
in
the
desert
pray
in
the
desert
for
us
and
one
thing
more
if
you
never
return
to
and
your
garden
is
to
pass
into
other
hands
don
t
let
it
go
into
the
hands
of
a
stranger
i
could
not
bear
that
let
it
come
to
me
at
any
price
you
name
forgive
me
for
writing
thus
perhaps
you
will
return
or
perhaps
even
if
you
do
not
you
will
keep
your
your
friend
in
a
postscript
was
an
address
which
would
always
find
her
count
anteoni
read
this
letter
two
or
three
times
carefully
with
a
grave
face
why
did
she
not
put
domini
androvsky
he
said
to
himself
he
locked
the
letter
in
a
drawer
all
that
night
he
was
haunted
by
thoughts
of
the
garden
again
and
again
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
stood
with
domini
beside
the
white
wall
and
saw
in
the
burning
distance
of
the
desert
at
the
call
of
the
mueddin
the
arabs
bowing
themselves
in
prayer
and
the
man
the
man
to
whom
now
she
had
bound
herself
by
the
most
holy
tie
fleeing
from
prayer
as
if
in
horror
but
it
was
written
he
murmured
to
himself
it
was
written
in
the
sand
and
in
fire
the
fate
of
every
man
have
we
bound
about
his
in
the
dawn
when
turning
towards
the
rising
sun
he
prayed
he
remembered
domini
and
her
words
pray
in
the
desert
for
and
in
the
garden
of
allah
he
prayed
to
allah
for
her
and
for
androvsky
meanwhile
the
camp
had
been
struck
and
the
first
stage
of
the
journey
northward
the
journey
back
had
been
accomplished
domini
had
given
the
order
of
departure
but
she
had
first
spoken
with
androvsky
after
his
narrative
and
her
words
that
followed
it
he
did
not
come
into
the
tent
she
did
not
ask
him
to
she
did
not
see
him
in
the
moonlight
beyond
the
tent
or
when
the
moonlight
waned
before
the
coming
of
the
dawn
she
was
upon
her
knees
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
striving
as
surely
few
human
beings
have
ever
had
to
strive
in
the
difficult
paths
of
life
at
first
she
had
felt
almost
calm
when
she
had
spoken
to
androvsky
there
had
even
been
a
strange
sensation
that
was
not
unlike
triumph
in
her
heart
in
this
triumph
she
had
felt
disembodied
as
if
she
were
a
spirit
standing
there
removed
from
earthly
suffering
but
able
to
contemplate
to
understand
to
pity
it
removed
from
earthly
sin
but
able
to
commit
an
action
that
might
help
to
purge
it
when
she
said
to
androvsky
now
you
can
pray
she
had
passed
into
a
region
where
self
had
no
existence
her
whole
soul
was
intent
upon
this
man
to
whom
she
had
given
all
the
treasures
of
her
heart
and
whom
she
knew
to
be
writhing
as
souls
writhe
in
purgatory
he
had
spoken
at
last
he
had
laid
bare
his
misery
his
crime
he
had
laid
bare
the
agony
of
one
who
had
insulted
god
but
who
repented
his
insult
who
had
wandered
far
away
from
god
but
who
could
never
be
happy
in
his
wandering
who
could
never
be
at
peace
even
in
a
mighty
human
love
unless
that
love
was
consecrated
by
god
s
contentment
with
it
as
she
stood
there
domini
had
had
an
instant
of
absolutely
clear
sight
into
the
depths
of
another
s
heart
another
s
nature
she
had
seen
the
monk
in
androvsky
not
slain
by
his
act
of
rejection
but
alive
quivering
scourged
and
she
had
been
able
to
tell
this
monk
as
god
seemed
to
be
telling
her
making
of
her
his
messenger
that
now
at
last
he
might
pray
to
a
god
who
again
would
hear
him
as
he
had
heard
him
in
the
garden
of
in
his
cell
in
the
chapel
in
the
fields
she
had
been
able
to
do
this
then
she
had
turned
away
gone
into
the
tent
and
fallen
upon
her
knees
but
with
that
personal
action
her
sense
of
triumph
passed
away
as
her
body
sank
down
her
soul
seemed
to
sink
down
with
it
into
bottomless
depths
of
blackness
where
no
light
had
ever
been
into
an
underworld
airless
peopled
with
invisible
violence
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
it
was
her
previous
flight
upward
which
had
caused
this
descent
into
a
place
which
had
surely
never
before
been
visited
by
a
human
soul
all
the
selflessness
suddenly
vanished
from
her
and
was
replaced
by
a
burning
sense
of
her
own
personality
of
what
was
due
to
it
of
what
had
been
done
to
it
of
what
it
now
was
she
saw
it
like
a
cloth
that
had
been
white
and
that
now
was
stained
with
indelible
filth
and
anger
came
upon
her
a
bitter
fury
in
which
she
was
inclined
to
cry
out
not
only
against
man
but
against
god
the
strength
of
her
nature
was
driven
into
a
wild
bitterness
the
sweet
waters
became
acrid
with
salt
she
had
been
able
a
moment
before
to
say
to
androvsky
almost
with
tenderness
now
at
last
you
can
now
she
was
on
her
knees
hating
him
hating
yes
surely
hating
god
it
was
a
frightful
sensation
soul
and
body
felt
defiled
she
saw
androvsky
coming
into
her
clean
life
seizing
her
like
a
prey
rolling
her
in
filth
that
could
never
be
cleansed
and
who
had
allowed
him
to
do
her
this
deadly
wrong
god
and
she
was
on
her
knees
to
this
god
who
had
permitted
this
she
was
in
the
attitude
of
worship
her
whole
being
rebelled
against
prayer
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
made
a
furious
physical
effort
to
rise
from
her
knees
but
as
if
her
body
was
paralysed
and
could
not
obey
her
will
she
remained
kneeling
therefore
like
a
woman
tied
down
like
a
blasphemer
bound
by
cords
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
whose
soul
was
shrieking
insults
against
heaven
presently
she
remembered
that
outside
androvsky
was
praying
that
she
had
meant
to
join
with
him
in
prayer
she
had
contemplated
then
a
further
deeper
union
with
him
was
she
a
madwoman
was
she
a
slave
was
she
as
one
of
those
women
of
history
who
seized
in
a
rape
resigned
themselves
to
love
and
obey
their
captors
she
began
to
hate
herself
and
still
she
knelt
anyone
coming
in
at
the
tent
door
would
have
seen
a
woman
apparently
entranced
in
an
ecstasy
of
worship
this
great
love
of
hers
to
what
had
it
brought
her
this
awakening
of
her
soul
what
was
its
meaning
god
had
sent
a
man
to
rouse
her
from
sleep
that
she
might
look
down
into
hell
again
and
again
with
ceaseless
reiteration
she
recalled
the
incidents
of
her
passion
in
the
desert
she
thought
of
the
night
at
arba
when
androvsky
blew
out
the
lamp
that
night
had
been
to
her
a
night
of
consecration
nothing
in
her
soul
had
risen
up
to
warn
her
no
instinct
no
woman
s
instinct
had
stayed
her
from
unwitting
sin
the
had
been
wiser
than
she
count
anteoni
more
the
priest
of
more
guided
by
holiness
by
the
inner
flame
that
flickers
before
the
wind
that
blows
out
of
the
caverns
of
evil
god
had
blinded
her
in
order
that
she
might
fall
had
brought
androvsky
to
her
in
order
that
her
religion
her
catholic
faith
might
be
made
hideous
to
her
for
ever
she
trembled
all
over
as
she
knelt
her
life
had
been
sad
even
tormented
and
she
had
set
out
upon
a
pilgrimage
to
find
peace
she
had
been
led
to
she
remembered
her
arrival
in
africa
its
spell
descending
upon
her
her
sensation
of
being
far
off
of
having
left
her
former
life
with
its
sorrows
for
ever
she
remembered
the
entrancing
quiet
of
count
anteoni
s
garden
how
as
she
entered
it
she
seemed
to
be
entering
an
earthly
paradise
a
place
prepared
by
god
for
one
who
was
weary
as
she
was
weary
for
one
who
longed
to
be
renewed
as
she
longed
to
be
renewed
and
in
that
paradise
in
the
inmost
recess
of
it
she
had
put
her
hands
against
androvsky
s
temples
and
given
her
life
her
fate
her
heart
into
his
keeping
that
was
why
the
garden
was
there
that
she
might
be
led
to
commit
this
frightful
action
in
it
her
soul
felt
physically
sick
as
to
her
body
but
just
then
she
scarcely
thought
of
the
body
for
she
was
thinking
of
her
soul
as
of
a
body
as
if
it
were
the
core
of
the
body
blackened
sullied
destroyed
for
ever
she
was
hot
with
shame
she
was
hot
with
a
fiery
indignation
always
since
she
was
a
child
if
she
were
suddenly
touched
by
anyone
whom
she
did
not
love
she
had
had
an
inclination
to
strike
a
blow
on
the
one
who
touched
her
now
it
was
as
if
an
unclean
hand
had
been
laid
on
her
soul
and
the
soul
quivered
with
longing
to
strike
back
again
she
thought
of
of
all
that
had
taken
place
there
she
realised
that
during
her
stay
there
a
crescendo
of
calm
had
taken
place
within
her
calm
of
the
spirit
a
crescendo
of
strength
spiritual
strength
a
crescendo
of
faith
and
of
hope
the
religion
which
had
almost
seemed
to
be
slipping
from
her
she
had
grasped
firmly
again
her
soul
had
arrived
in
an
invalid
and
had
become
a
convalescent
it
had
been
reclining
wearily
fretfully
in
it
had
stood
up
walked
sung
as
the
morning
stars
sang
together
but
then
why
if
this
was
to
be
the
end
why
why
and
at
this
question
she
paused
as
before
a
great
portal
that
was
shut
she
went
back
she
thought
again
of
this
beautiful
crescendo
of
this
gradual
approach
to
the
god
from
whom
she
had
been
if
not
entirely
separated
at
any
rate
set
a
little
apart
could
it
have
been
only
in
order
that
her
catastrophe
might
be
the
more
complete
her
downfall
the
more
absolute
and
then
she
knew
not
why
she
seemed
to
see
in
the
hands
that
were
pressed
against
her
face
words
written
in
fire
and
to
read
them
slowly
as
a
child
spelling
out
a
great
lesson
with
an
intense
attention
with
a
labour
whose
result
would
be
eternal
recollection
love
watcheth
and
sleeping
slumbereth
not
when
weary
it
is
not
tired
when
straitened
it
is
not
constrained
when
frightened
it
is
not
disturbed
but
like
a
vivid
flame
and
a
burning
torch
it
mounteth
upwards
and
securely
passeth
through
all
whosover
loveth
knoweth
the
cry
of
this
the
cry
of
this
voice
at
that
moment
in
the
vast
silence
of
the
desert
she
seemed
to
hear
it
and
it
was
the
cry
of
her
own
voice
it
was
the
cry
of
the
voice
of
her
own
soul
startled
she
lifted
her
face
from
her
hands
and
listened
she
did
not
look
out
at
the
tent
door
but
she
saw
the
moonlight
falling
upon
the
matting
that
was
spread
upon
the
sand
within
the
tent
and
she
repeated
love
watcheth
love
watcheth
love
watcheth
moving
her
lips
like
the
child
who
reads
with
difficulty
then
came
the
thought
i
am
the
passion
of
personal
anger
had
died
away
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
she
felt
numb
and
yet
excited
she
leaned
forward
and
once
more
laid
her
face
in
her
hands
love
watcheth
i
am
then
a
moment
then
god
is
watching
she
whispered
the
words
over
again
and
again
and
the
numbness
began
to
pass
away
and
the
anger
was
dead
always
she
had
felt
as
if
she
had
been
led
to
africa
for
some
definite
end
did
not
the
freed
negroes
far
out
in
the
desert
sing
their
song
of
the
deeper
mysteries
no
one
but
god
and
i
knows
what
is
in
my
heart
and
had
not
she
heard
it
again
and
again
and
each
time
with
a
sense
of
awe
she
had
always
thought
that
the
words
were
wonderful
and
beautiful
but
she
had
thought
that
perhaps
they
were
not
true
she
had
said
to
androvsky
that
he
knew
what
was
in
her
heart
and
now
in
this
night
in
its
intense
stillness
close
to
the
man
who
for
so
long
had
not
dared
to
pray
but
who
now
was
praying
again
she
thought
that
they
were
not
quite
true
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
did
not
know
what
was
in
her
heart
and
that
she
was
waiting
there
for
god
to
come
and
tell
her
would
he
come
she
waited
patience
entered
into
her
the
silence
was
long
night
was
travelling
turning
her
thoughts
to
a
distant
world
the
moon
waned
and
a
faint
breath
of
wind
that
was
almost
cold
stole
over
the
sands
among
the
graves
in
the
cemetery
to
the
man
and
the
woman
who
were
keeping
vigil
upon
their
knees
the
wind
died
away
almost
ere
it
had
risen
and
the
rigid
silence
that
precedes
the
dawn
held
the
desert
in
its
grasp
and
god
came
to
domini
in
the
silence
allah
through
allah
s
garden
that
was
shrouded
still
in
the
shadows
of
night
once
as
she
journeyed
through
the
roaring
of
the
storm
she
had
listened
for
the
voice
of
the
desert
and
as
the
desert
took
her
its
voice
had
spoken
to
her
in
a
sudden
and
magical
silence
in
a
falling
of
the
wind
now
in
a
more
magical
silence
the
voice
of
god
spoke
to
her
and
the
voice
of
the
desert
and
of
god
were
as
one
as
she
knelt
she
heard
god
telling
her
what
was
in
her
heart
it
was
a
strange
and
passionate
revelation
she
trembled
as
she
heard
and
sometimes
she
was
inclined
to
say
it
is
not
and
sometimes
she
was
afraid
afraid
of
what
this
all
this
that
was
in
her
heart
would
lead
her
to
do
for
god
told
her
of
a
strength
which
she
had
not
known
her
heart
possessed
which
so
it
seemed
to
her
she
did
not
wish
it
to
possess
of
a
strength
from
which
something
within
her
shrank
against
which
something
within
her
protested
but
god
would
not
be
denied
he
told
her
she
had
this
strength
he
told
her
that
she
must
use
it
he
told
her
that
she
would
use
it
and
she
began
to
understand
something
of
the
mystery
of
the
purposes
of
god
in
relation
to
herself
and
to
understand
with
it
how
closely
companioned
even
those
who
strive
after
effacement
of
self
are
by
selfishness
how
closely
companioned
she
had
been
on
her
african
pilgrimage
everything
that
had
happened
in
africa
she
had
quietly
taken
to
herself
as
a
gift
made
to
her
for
herself
the
peace
that
had
descended
upon
her
was
balm
for
her
soul
and
was
sent
merely
for
that
to
stop
the
pain
she
suffered
from
old
wounds
that
she
might
be
comfortably
at
rest
the
crescendo
the
beautiful
crescendo
of
calm
of
strength
of
faith
of
hope
which
she
had
as
it
were
heard
like
a
noble
music
within
her
spirit
had
been
the
david
sent
to
play
upon
the
harp
to
her
saul
that
from
her
saul
the
black
demon
of
unrest
of
despair
might
depart
that
was
what
she
had
believed
she
had
believed
that
she
had
come
to
africa
for
herself
and
now
god
in
the
silence
was
telling
her
that
this
was
not
so
that
he
had
brought
her
to
africa
to
sacrifice
herself
in
the
redemption
of
another
and
as
she
listened
listened
with
bowed
head
and
eyes
in
which
tears
were
gathering
from
which
tears
were
falling
upon
her
clasped
hands
she
knew
that
it
was
true
she
knew
that
god
meant
her
to
put
away
her
selfishness
to
rise
above
it
those
eagle
s
wings
of
which
she
had
thought
she
must
spread
them
she
must
soar
towards
the
place
of
the
angels
whither
good
women
soar
in
the
great
moments
of
their
love
borne
up
by
the
winds
of
god
on
the
minaret
of
the
mosque
of
while
androvsky
remained
in
the
dark
shadow
with
a
curse
she
had
mounted
with
prayer
surely
a
little
way
towards
god
and
now
god
said
to
her
mount
higher
come
nearer
to
me
bring
another
with
you
that
was
my
purpose
in
leading
you
to
in
leading
you
far
out
into
the
desert
in
leading
you
into
the
heart
of
the
she
had
been
led
to
africa
for
a
definite
end
and
now
she
knew
what
that
end
was
on
the
mosque
of
the
minaret
of
she
had
surely
seen
prayer
travelling
the
soul
of
prayer
travelling
and
she
had
asked
herself
whither
she
had
asked
herself
where
was
the
with
at
last
the
pitched
tent
the
camp
fires
and
the
long
the
long
repose
and
when
she
came
down
into
the
court
of
the
mosque
and
found
androvsky
watching
the
old
arab
who
struck
against
the
mosque
and
cursed
she
had
wished
that
androvsky
had
mounted
with
her
a
little
way
towards
god
he
should
mount
with
her
always
she
had
longed
to
see
him
above
her
could
she
leave
him
below
she
knew
she
could
not
she
understood
that
god
did
not
mean
her
to
she
understood
perfectly
and
tears
streamed
from
her
eyes
for
now
there
came
upon
her
a
full
comprehension
of
her
love
for
androvsky
his
revelation
had
not
killed
it
as
for
a
moment
in
her
passionate
personal
anger
she
had
been
inclined
to
think
indeed
it
seemed
to
her
now
that
till
this
hour
of
silence
she
had
never
really
loved
him
never
known
how
to
love
even
in
the
tent
at
arba
she
had
not
fully
loved
him
perfectly
loved
him
for
the
thought
of
self
the
desires
of
self
the
passion
of
self
had
entered
into
and
been
mingled
with
her
love
but
now
she
loved
him
perfectly
because
she
loved
as
god
intended
her
to
love
she
loved
him
as
god
s
envoy
sent
to
him
she
was
still
weeping
but
she
began
to
feel
calm
as
if
the
stillness
of
this
hour
before
the
dawn
entered
into
her
soul
she
thought
of
herself
now
only
as
a
vessel
into
which
god
was
pouring
his
purpose
and
his
love
just
as
dawn
was
breaking
as
the
first
streak
of
light
stole
into
the
east
and
threw
a
frail
spear
of
gold
upon
the
sands
she
was
conscious
again
of
a
thrill
of
life
within
her
of
the
movement
of
her
unborn
child
then
she
lifted
her
head
from
her
hand
looking
towards
the
east
and
whispered
give
me
strength
for
one
more
thing
give
me
strength
to
be
silent
she
waited
as
if
for
an
answer
then
she
rose
from
her
knees
bathed
her
face
and
went
out
to
the
tent
door
to
androvsky
boris
she
said
he
rose
from
his
knees
and
looked
at
her
holding
the
little
wooden
crucifix
in
his
hand
domini
he
said
in
an
uncertain
voice
put
it
back
into
your
breast
keep
it
for
ever
as
if
mechanically
and
not
removing
his
eyes
from
her
he
put
the
crucifix
into
his
breast
after
a
moment
she
spoke
again
quietly
boris
you
never
wished
to
stay
here
you
meant
to
stay
here
for
me
let
us
go
away
from
amara
let
us
go
now
in
the
us
he
said
there
was
a
profound
amazement
in
his
voice
yes
she
answered
away
from
amara
you
and
i
together
yes
boris
where
where
can
we
go
the
amazement
seemed
to
deepen
in
his
voice
his
eyes
were
watching
her
with
an
almost
fierce
intentness
in
a
flash
of
insight
she
realised
that
just
then
he
was
wondering
about
her
as
he
had
never
wondered
before
wondering
whether
she
was
really
the
good
woman
at
whose
feet
his
soul
had
worshipped
yes
he
was
asking
himself
that
question
boris
she
said
will
you
leave
yourself
in
my
hands
we
have
talked
of
our
future
life
we
have
wondered
what
we
should
do
will
you
let
me
do
as
i
will
let
the
future
be
as
i
choose
in
her
heart
she
said
as
god
yes
domini
he
answered
i
am
in
your
hands
utterly
in
your
no
she
said
neither
of
them
spoke
after
that
till
the
sunlight
lay
above
the
towers
and
minarets
of
amara
then
domini
said
we
will
go
and
that
morning
the
camp
was
struck
and
the
new
journey
began
the
journey
back
chapter
xxviii
a
silence
had
fallen
between
domini
and
androvsky
which
neither
seemed
able
to
break
they
rode
on
side
by
side
across
the
sands
towards
the
north
through
the
long
day
the
tower
of
amara
faded
in
the
sunshine
above
the
white
crests
of
the
dunes
the
arab
villages
upon
their
little
hills
disappeared
in
the
quivering
gold
new
vistas
of
desert
opened
before
them
oases
crowded
with
palms
salt
lakes
and
stony
ground
they
passed
by
native
towns
they
saw
the
negro
gardeners
laughing
among
the
rills
of
yellow
water
or
climbing
with
bare
feet
the
wrinkled
tree
trunks
to
lop
away
dead
branches
they
heard
tiny
goatherds
piping
solitary
in
the
wastes
dreams
of
the
mirage
rose
and
faded
far
off
on
the
horizon
rose
and
faded
mystically
leaving
no
trembling
trace
behind
and
they
were
silent
as
the
mirage
she
in
her
purpose
he
in
his
wonder
and
the
long
day
waned
and
towards
evening
the
camp
was
pitched
and
the
evening
meal
was
prepared
and
still
they
could
not
speak
sometimes
androvsky
watched
her
and
there
was
a
great
calm
in
her
face
but
there
was
no
rebuke
no
smallness
of
anger
no
hint
of
despair
always
he
had
felt
her
strength
of
mind
and
body
but
never
so
much
as
now
could
he
rest
on
it
dared
he
he
did
not
know
and
the
day
seemed
to
him
to
become
a
dream
and
the
silence
recalled
to
him
the
silence
of
the
monastery
in
which
he
had
worshipped
god
before
the
stranger
came
he
thought
that
in
this
silence
he
ought
to
feel
that
she
was
deliberately
raising
barriers
between
them
but
it
was
strange
he
could
not
feel
this
in
her
silence
there
was
no
bitterness
when
is
there
bitterness
in
strength
he
rode
on
and
on
beside
her
and
his
sense
of
a
dream
deepened
helped
by
the
influence
of
the
desert
where
were
they
going
he
did
not
know
what
was
her
purpose
he
could
not
tell
but
he
felt
that
she
had
a
purpose
that
her
mind
was
resolved
now
and
then
tearing
himself
with
an
effort
from
the
dream
he
asked
himself
what
it
could
be
what
could
be
in
store
for
him
for
them
after
the
thing
he
had
told
what
could
be
their
mutual
life
must
it
not
be
for
ever
at
an
end
was
it
not
shattered
was
it
not
dust
like
the
dust
of
the
desert
that
rose
round
their
horses
feet
the
silence
did
not
tell
him
and
again
he
ceased
from
wondering
and
the
dream
closed
round
him
were
they
not
travelling
in
a
mirage
mirage
people
unreal
phantomlike
who
would
presently
fade
away
into
the
spaces
of
the
sun
the
sand
muffled
the
tread
of
the
horses
feet
the
desert
understood
their
silence
clothed
it
in
a
silence
more
vast
and
more
impenetrable
and
androvsky
had
made
his
effort
he
had
spoken
the
truth
at
last
he
could
do
no
more
he
was
incapable
of
any
further
action
as
domini
felt
herself
to
be
in
the
hands
of
god
he
felt
himself
to
be
in
the
hands
of
this
woman
who
had
received
his
confession
with
this
wonderful
calm
who
was
leading
him
he
knew
not
whither
in
this
wonderful
silence
when
the
camp
was
pitched
however
he
noticed
something
that
caught
him
sharply
away
from
the
dreamlike
unreal
feeling
and
set
him
face
to
face
with
fact
that
was
cold
as
steel
always
till
now
the
had
been
pitched
beside
their
with
the
flap
of
the
entrance
removed
so
that
the
two
tents
communicated
it
stood
apart
near
the
and
in
it
was
placed
one
of
the
small
camp
beds
androvsky
was
alone
when
he
saw
this
on
reaching
the
he
had
walked
a
little
way
into
the
desert
when
he
returned
he
found
this
change
it
told
him
something
of
what
was
passing
in
domini
s
mind
and
it
marked
the
transformation
of
their
mutual
life
as
he
gazed
at
the
two
tents
he
felt
stricken
yet
he
felt
a
curious
sense
of
something
that
was
like
was
it
not
like
relief
it
was
as
if
his
body
had
received
a
frightful
blow
and
on
his
soul
a
saint
s
hand
had
been
gently
laid
as
if
something
fell
about
him
in
ruins
and
at
the
same
time
a
building
which
he
loved
and
which
for
a
moment
he
had
thought
tottering
stood
firm
before
him
founded
upon
rock
he
was
a
man
capable
of
a
passionate
belief
despite
his
sin
and
he
had
always
had
a
passionate
belief
in
domini
s
religion
that
morning
when
she
came
out
to
him
in
the
sand
a
momentary
doubt
had
assailed
him
he
had
known
the
thought
does
she
love
me
still
does
she
love
me
more
than
she
loves
god
more
than
she
loves
his
dictates
manifested
in
the
catholic
religion
when
she
said
that
word
together
that
had
been
his
thought
now
as
he
looked
at
the
two
tents
a
white
light
seemed
to
fall
upon
domini
s
character
and
in
this
white
light
stood
the
ruin
and
the
house
that
was
founded
upon
a
rock
he
was
torn
by
conflicting
sensations
of
despair
and
triumph
she
was
what
he
had
believed
that
made
the
triumph
but
since
she
was
that
where
was
his
future
with
her
the
monk
and
the
man
who
had
fled
from
the
monastery
stood
up
within
him
to
do
battle
the
monk
knew
triumph
but
the
man
was
in
torment
presently
as
androvsky
looked
at
the
two
tents
the
monk
in
him
seemed
to
die
a
new
death
the
man
who
had
left
the
monastery
to
know
a
new
resurrection
he
was
seized
by
a
furious
desire
to
go
backward
in
time
to
go
backward
but
a
few
hours
to
the
moment
when
domini
did
not
know
what
now
she
knew
he
cursed
himself
for
what
he
had
done
at
last
he
had
been
able
to
pray
yes
but
what
was
prayer
now
what
was
prayer
to
the
man
who
looked
at
the
two
tents
and
understood
what
they
meant
he
moved
away
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
near
to
the
two
tents
he
did
not
know
where
domini
was
at
a
little
distance
he
saw
the
servants
busy
preparing
the
evening
meal
smoke
rose
up
before
the
cook
s
tent
curling
away
stealthily
among
a
group
of
palm
trees
beneath
which
some
arab
boys
were
huddled
staring
with
wide
eyes
at
the
unusual
sight
of
travellers
they
came
from
a
tiny
village
at
a
short
distance
off
half
hidden
among
palm
gardens
the
camels
were
feeding
a
mule
was
rolling
voluptuously
in
the
sand
at
a
well
a
shepherd
was
watering
his
flocks
which
crowded
about
him
baaing
expectantly
the
air
seemed
to
breathe
out
a
subtle
aroma
of
peace
and
of
liberty
and
this
apparent
presence
of
peace
this
vision
of
the
calm
of
others
human
beings
and
animals
added
to
the
torture
of
androvsky
as
he
walked
to
and
fro
he
felt
as
if
he
were
being
devoured
by
his
passions
as
if
he
were
losing
the
last
vestiges
of
never
in
the
monastery
never
even
in
the
night
when
he
left
it
had
he
been
tormented
like
this
for
now
he
had
a
terrible
companion
whom
at
that
time
he
had
not
known
memory
walked
with
him
before
the
tents
the
memory
of
his
body
recalling
and
calling
for
the
past
he
had
destroyed
that
past
himself
but
for
him
it
might
have
been
also
the
present
the
future
it
might
have
lasted
for
years
perhaps
till
death
took
him
or
domini
why
not
he
had
only
had
to
keep
silence
to
insist
on
remaining
in
the
desert
far
from
the
busy
ways
of
men
they
could
have
lived
as
certain
others
lived
who
loved
the
free
the
solitary
life
in
an
oasis
of
their
own
tending
their
gardens
of
palms
life
would
have
gone
like
a
sunlit
dream
and
death
at
that
thought
he
shuddered
death
what
would
that
have
been
to
him
what
would
it
be
now
when
it
came
he
put
the
thought
from
him
with
force
as
a
man
thrusts
away
from
him
the
filthy
hand
of
a
clamouring
stranger
assailing
him
in
the
street
this
evening
he
had
no
time
to
think
of
death
life
was
enough
life
with
this
terror
which
he
had
deliberately
placed
in
it
he
thought
of
himself
as
a
madman
for
having
spoken
to
domini
he
cursed
himself
as
a
madman
for
he
knew
although
he
strove
furiously
not
to
know
how
irrevocable
was
his
act
in
consequence
of
the
great
strength
of
her
nature
he
knew
that
though
she
had
been
to
him
a
woman
of
fire
she
might
be
to
him
a
woman
of
iron
even
to
him
whom
she
loved
how
she
had
loved
him
he
walked
faster
before
the
tents
to
and
fro
how
she
had
loved
him
how
she
loved
him
still
at
this
moment
after
she
knew
what
he
was
what
he
had
done
to
her
he
had
no
doubt
of
her
love
as
he
walked
there
he
felt
it
like
a
tender
hand
upon
him
but
that
hand
was
inflexible
too
in
its
softness
there
was
firmness
firmness
that
would
never
yield
to
any
strength
in
him
those
two
tents
told
him
the
story
of
her
strength
as
he
looked
at
them
he
was
looking
into
her
soul
and
her
soul
was
in
direct
conflict
with
his
that
was
what
he
felt
she
had
thought
she
had
made
up
her
mind
quietly
silently
she
had
acted
by
that
action
without
a
word
she
had
spoken
to
him
told
him
a
tremendous
thing
and
the
man
the
passionate
man
who
had
left
the
monastery
loose
in
him
now
was
aflame
with
an
impotent
desire
that
was
like
a
heat
of
fury
against
her
while
the
monk
hidden
far
down
in
him
was
secretly
worshipping
her
cleanliness
of
spirit
but
the
man
who
had
left
the
monastery
was
in
the
ascendant
in
him
and
at
last
drove
him
to
a
determination
that
the
monk
secretly
knew
to
be
utterly
vain
he
made
up
his
mind
to
enter
into
conflict
with
domini
s
strength
he
felt
that
he
must
that
he
could
not
quietly
without
a
word
accept
this
sudden
new
life
of
separation
symbolised
for
him
by
the
two
tents
standing
apart
he
stood
still
in
the
distance
under
the
palms
he
saw
batouch
laughing
with
ouardi
near
them
ali
was
reposing
on
a
mat
moving
his
head
from
side
to
side
smiling
with
vacant
eyes
and
singing
a
languid
song
this
music
maddened
him
batouch
he
called
out
sharply
batouch
batouch
stopped
laughing
glanced
round
then
came
towards
him
with
a
large
pace
swinging
from
his
hips
monsieur
batouch
androvsky
said
but
he
could
not
go
on
he
could
not
say
anything
about
the
two
tents
to
a
servant
where
where
is
madame
he
said
almost
stammering
out
there
with
a
sweeping
arm
the
poet
pointed
towards
a
hump
of
sand
crowned
by
a
few
palms
domini
was
sitting
there
surrounded
by
arab
children
to
whom
she
was
giving
sweets
out
of
a
box
as
androvsky
saw
her
the
anger
in
him
burnt
up
more
fiercely
this
action
of
domini
s
simple
natural
though
it
was
seemed
to
him
in
his
present
condition
cruelly
heartless
he
thought
of
her
giving
the
order
about
the
tents
and
then
going
calmly
to
play
with
these
children
while
he
while
he
you
can
go
batouch
he
said
go
the
poet
stared
at
him
with
a
superb
surprise
then
moved
slowly
towards
ouardi
holding
his
burnous
with
his
large
hands
androvsky
looked
again
at
the
two
tents
as
a
man
looks
at
two
enemies
then
walking
quickly
he
went
towards
the
hump
of
sand
as
he
approached
it
domini
had
her
side
face
turned
towards
him
she
did
not
see
him
the
little
arabs
were
dancing
round
her
on
their
naked
feet
laughing
showing
their
white
teeth
and
opening
their
mouths
wide
for
the
gaiety
incarnate
androvsky
gazed
at
the
woman
who
was
causing
this
childish
joy
and
he
saw
a
profound
sadness
never
had
he
seen
domini
s
face
look
like
this
it
was
always
white
but
now
its
whiteness
was
like
a
whiteness
of
marble
she
moved
her
head
turning
to
feed
one
of
the
little
gaping
mouths
and
he
saw
her
eyes
tearless
but
sadder
than
if
they
had
been
full
of
tears
she
was
looking
at
these
children
as
a
mother
looks
at
her
children
who
are
fatherless
he
did
not
how
could
he
understand
the
look
but
it
went
to
his
heart
he
stopped
watching
one
of
the
children
saw
him
shrieked
pointed
domini
glanced
round
as
she
saw
him
she
smiled
threw
the
last
and
came
towards
him
do
you
want
me
she
said
coming
up
to
him
his
lips
trembled
yes
he
said
i
want
something
in
his
voice
seemed
to
startle
her
but
she
said
nothing
more
only
stood
looking
at
him
the
children
who
had
followed
her
crowded
round
them
touching
their
clothes
curiously
send
them
away
he
said
she
made
the
children
go
pushing
them
gently
pointing
to
the
village
and
showing
the
empty
box
to
them
reluctantly
at
last
they
went
towards
the
village
turning
their
heads
to
stare
at
her
till
they
were
a
long
way
off
then
holding
up
their
skirts
and
racing
for
the
houses
domini
domini
he
said
you
can
you
can
play
with
children
i
wanted
to
feel
i
could
give
a
little
happiness
she
answered
even
when
when
to
me
to
me
you
are
giving
but
before
her
steady
gaze
all
the
words
he
had
meant
to
say
all
the
words
of
furious
protest
died
on
his
lips
to
me
to
me
he
repeated
then
he
was
silent
boris
she
said
i
want
to
give
you
one
thing
the
thing
that
you
have
lost
i
want
to
give
you
back
you
never
i
must
try
even
if
i
can
not
i
shall
know
that
i
have
you
are
giving
me
you
are
giving
me
not
peace
but
a
sword
he
said
she
understood
that
he
had
seen
the
two
tents
sometimes
a
sword
can
give
the
peace
of
boris
my
dear
one
there
are
many
kinds
of
deaths
try
to
trust
me
leave
me
to
act
as
i
must
act
let
me
try
to
be
guided
only
let
me
he
did
not
say
another
word
that
night
they
slept
apart
for
the
first
time
since
their
marriage
domini
where
are
you
taking
me
where
are
we
going
the
camp
was
struck
once
more
and
they
were
riding
through
the
desert
domini
hesitated
to
answer
his
question
it
had
been
put
with
a
sort
of
terror
i
know
nothing
he
continued
i
am
in
your
hands
like
a
child
it
can
not
be
always
so
i
must
know
i
must
understand
what
is
our
life
to
be
what
is
our
future
a
man
can
not
he
paused
then
he
said
i
feel
that
you
have
come
to
some
resolve
i
feel
it
perpetually
it
is
as
if
you
were
in
light
and
i
in
darkness
you
in
knowledge
and
i
in
ignorance
you
you
must
tell
me
i
have
told
you
all
now
you
must
tell
but
she
hesitated
not
now
she
answered
not
we
are
to
journey
on
day
by
day
like
this
and
i
am
not
to
know
where
we
are
going
i
can
not
domini
i
will
boris
i
shall
tell
when
will
you
trust
me
boris
completely
can
you
how
boris
i
have
prayed
so
much
for
you
that
at
last
i
feel
that
i
can
act
for
you
don
t
think
me
presumptuous
if
you
could
see
into
my
heart
you
would
see
that
indeed
i
don
t
think
it
would
be
possible
to
feel
more
humble
than
i
do
in
regard
to
humble
you
domini
you
can
feel
humble
when
you
think
of
me
when
you
are
with
yes
you
have
suffered
so
terribly
god
has
led
you
i
feel
that
he
has
been
oh
i
don
t
know
how
to
say
it
quite
naturally
quite
as
i
feel
it
that
he
has
been
more
intent
on
you
than
on
anyone
i
have
ever
known
i
feel
that
his
meaning
in
regarding
to
you
is
intense
boris
as
if
he
would
not
let
you
he
let
me
go
when
i
left
the
does
one
never
return
again
a
sensation
almost
of
terror
assailed
him
he
felt
as
if
he
were
fighting
in
darkness
something
that
he
could
not
see
return
he
said
what
do
you
mean
she
saw
the
expression
of
almost
angry
fear
in
his
face
it
warned
her
not
to
give
the
reins
to
her
natural
impulse
which
was
always
towards
a
great
frankness
boris
you
fled
from
god
but
do
you
not
think
it
possible
that
you
could
ever
return
to
him
have
you
not
taken
the
first
step
have
you
not
prayed
his
face
changed
grew
slightly
calmer
you
told
me
i
could
pray
he
answered
almost
like
a
child
otherwise
i
i
should
not
have
dared
to
i
should
have
felt
that
i
was
insulting
if
you
trusted
me
in
such
a
thing
can
you
not
trust
me
now
but
he
said
uneasily
but
this
is
different
a
worldly
matter
a
matter
of
daily
life
i
shall
have
to
then
why
should
i
not
know
now
at
any
moment
i
could
ask
batouch
only
knows
from
day
to
day
i
have
a
map
of
the
desert
i
got
it
before
we
left
something
perhaps
a
very
slight
hesitation
in
her
voice
just
before
she
said
the
last
words
startled
him
he
turned
on
his
horse
and
looked
at
her
hard
domini
he
said
are
we
we
are
not
going
back
to
i
will
tell
you
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
let
me
tell
you
he
said
no
more
but
he
gazed
at
her
for
a
long
time
as
if
striving
passionately
to
read
her
thoughts
but
he
could
not
her
white
face
was
calm
and
she
rode
looking
straight
before
her
as
one
that
looked
towards
some
distant
goal
to
which
all
her
soul
was
journeying
with
her
body
there
was
something
mystical
in
her
face
in
that
straight
glance
that
surely
pierced
beyond
the
blue
horizon
line
and
reached
a
faroff
world
what
world
he
asked
himself
the
question
but
no
answer
came
and
he
dropped
his
eyes
a
new
and
horrible
sadness
came
to
him
a
new
sensation
of
separation
from
domini
she
had
set
their
bodies
apart
and
he
had
yielded
now
was
she
not
setting
something
else
apart
for
in
spite
of
all
in
spite
of
his
treacherous
existence
with
her
he
had
so
deeply
and
entirely
loved
her
that
he
had
sometimes
felt
dared
to
feel
that
in
their
passion
in
the
desert
their
souls
had
been
fused
together
his
was
black
he
knew
it
and
hers
was
white
but
had
not
the
fire
and
the
depth
of
their
love
conquered
all
differences
made
even
their
souls
one
as
their
bodies
had
been
one
and
now
was
she
not
silently
subtly
withdrawing
her
soul
from
his
a
sensation
of
acute
despair
swept
over
him
of
utter
impotence
domini
he
said
domini
yes
she
answered
and
this
time
she
withdrew
her
eyes
from
the
blue
distance
and
looked
at
him
domini
you
must
trust
he
was
thinking
of
the
two
tents
set
the
one
apart
from
the
other
domini
i
ve
borne
something
in
silence
i
haven
t
spoken
i
wanted
to
speak
i
tried
but
i
did
not
i
bore
my
punishment
you
don
t
know
you
ll
never
know
what
i
felt
last
last
night
when
i
ve
borne
that
but
there
s
one
thing
i
can
t
bear
i
ve
lived
a
lie
with
you
my
love
for
you
overcame
me
i
fell
i
have
told
you
that
i
fell
don
t
don
t
because
of
that
don
t
take
away
your
heart
from
me
entirely
domini
domini
don
t
do
she
heard
a
sound
of
despair
in
his
voice
oh
boris
she
said
if
you
knew
there
was
only
one
moment
when
i
fancied
my
heart
was
leaving
you
it
passed
almost
before
it
came
and
now
but
he
interrupted
do
you
know
do
you
know
that
since
since
i
spoke
since
i
told
you
you
ve
you
ve
never
touched
me
yes
i
know
it
she
replied
quietly
something
told
him
to
be
silent
then
something
told
him
to
wait
till
the
night
came
and
the
camp
was
pitched
once
more
they
rested
at
noon
for
several
hours
as
it
was
impossible
to
travel
in
the
heat
of
the
day
the
camp
started
an
hour
before
they
did
only
batouch
remained
behind
to
show
them
the
way
to
where
they
would
pass
the
following
night
when
batouch
brought
the
horses
he
said
does
madame
know
the
meaning
of
no
said
domini
what
is
it
source
des
tourterelles
replied
batouch
i
was
there
once
with
an
english
source
des
tourterelles
repeated
domini
is
it
beautiful
batouch
it
sounds
as
if
it
ought
to
be
she
scarcely
knew
why
but
she
had
a
longing
that
might
be
tender
calm
a
place
to
soothe
the
spirit
a
place
in
which
androvsky
might
be
influenced
to
listen
to
what
she
had
to
tell
him
without
revolt
without
despair
once
he
had
spoken
about
the
influence
of
place
about
rising
superior
to
it
but
she
believed
in
it
and
she
waited
almost
anxiously
for
the
reply
of
batouch
as
usual
it
was
enigmatic
madame
will
see
he
answered
madame
will
see
but
the
englishman
yes
the
englishman
was
ravished
this
he
said
to
me
this
batouch
is
a
little
paradise
and
there
was
no
moon
then
there
will
be
a
paradise
exclaimed
androvsky
he
sprang
upon
his
horse
and
pulled
up
the
reins
domini
said
no
more
they
had
started
late
it
was
night
when
they
reached
as
they
drew
near
domini
looked
before
her
eagerly
through
the
pale
gloom
that
hung
over
the
sand
she
saw
no
village
only
a
very
small
grove
of
palms
and
near
it
the
outline
of
a
bordj
the
place
was
set
in
a
cup
of
the
sahara
all
around
it
rose
low
hummocks
of
sand
on
two
or
three
of
them
were
isolated
clumps
of
palms
here
the
eyes
roamed
over
no
vast
distances
there
was
little
suggestion
of
space
she
drew
up
her
horse
on
one
of
the
hummocks
and
gazed
down
she
heard
doves
murmuring
in
their
soft
voices
among
the
trees
the
tents
were
pitched
near
the
bordj
what
does
madame
think
asked
batouch
does
madame
agree
with
the
englishman
it
is
a
strange
little
place
she
answered
she
listened
to
the
voices
of
the
doves
a
dog
barked
by
the
bordj
it
is
almost
like
a
she
added
androvsky
said
nothing
but
he
too
was
gazing
intently
at
the
trees
below
them
he
too
was
listening
to
the
voices
of
the
doves
after
a
moment
he
looked
at
her
domini
he
whispered
here
won
t
you
won
t
you
let
me
touch
your
hand
again
here
come
boris
she
answered
it
is
they
rode
down
into
the
tents
had
all
been
pitched
near
together
on
the
south
of
the
bordj
and
separated
by
it
from
the
tiny
oasis
opposite
to
them
was
a
cafe
maure
of
the
humblest
kind
a
hovel
of
baked
earth
and
brushwood
with
earthen
divans
and
a
coffee
niche
before
this
was
squatting
a
group
of
five
dirty
desert
men
the
sole
inhabitants
of
just
before
dinner
domini
gave
an
order
to
batouch
and
while
they
were
dining
androvsky
noticed
that
their
people
were
busy
unpegging
the
two
what
are
they
doing
he
said
to
domini
uneasily
in
his
present
condition
everything
roused
in
him
anxiety
in
every
unusual
action
he
discerned
the
beginning
of
some
tragedy
which
might
affect
his
life
i
told
batouch
to
put
our
tents
on
the
other
side
of
the
bordj
she
answered
yes
but
why
i
thought
that
it
would
be
better
if
we
were
a
little
more
alone
than
we
are
here
just
opposite
to
that
cafe
maure
and
with
the
servants
and
on
the
other
side
there
are
the
palms
and
the
water
and
the
doves
were
talking
there
as
we
rode
in
when
we
have
finished
dinner
we
can
go
and
sit
there
and
be
together
he
said
an
eager
light
had
come
into
his
eyes
he
leaned
forward
towards
her
over
the
little
table
and
stretched
out
his
hand
yes
together
she
said
but
she
did
not
take
his
hand
domini
he
said
still
keeping
his
hand
on
the
table
domini
an
expression
that
was
like
an
expression
of
agony
flitted
over
her
face
and
died
away
leaving
it
calm
let
us
finish
she
said
quietly
look
they
have
taken
the
tents
in
a
moment
we
can
the
doves
were
silent
the
night
was
very
still
in
this
nest
of
the
sahara
ouardi
brought
them
coffee
and
batouch
came
to
say
that
the
tents
were
ready
we
shall
want
nothing
more
batouch
domini
said
don
t
disturb
batouch
glanced
towards
the
cafe
maure
a
red
light
gleamed
through
its
low
doorway
one
or
two
arabs
were
moving
within
some
of
the
camp
attendants
had
joined
the
squatting
men
without
a
noise
of
busy
voices
reached
the
tents
madame
batouch
said
proudly
i
am
going
to
tell
stories
from
the
and
one
i
am
going
to
tell
the
story
of
the
young
prince
of
the
indies
and
the
story
of
ganem
the
slave
of
love
it
is
not
often
that
in
a
poet
no
indeed
go
to
them
batouch
they
must
be
impatient
for
batouch
smiled
broadly
madame
begins
to
understand
the
arabs
he
rejoined
madame
will
soon
be
as
the
go
batouch
look
they
are
longing
for
she
pointed
to
the
desert
men
who
were
gesticulating
and
gazing
towards
the
tents
it
is
better
so
madame
he
answered
they
know
that
i
am
here
only
for
one
night
and
they
are
eager
as
the
hungry
jackal
is
eager
for
food
among
the
yellow
dunes
of
the
he
threw
his
burnous
over
his
shoulder
and
moved
away
smiling
and
murmuring
in
a
luscious
voice
the
first
words
of
ganem
the
slave
of
love
let
us
go
now
boris
domini
said
he
got
up
at
once
from
the
table
and
they
walked
together
round
the
bordj
on
its
further
side
there
was
no
sign
of
life
no
traveller
was
resting
there
that
night
and
the
big
door
that
led
into
the
inner
court
was
closed
and
barred
the
guardian
had
gone
to
join
the
arabs
at
the
cafe
maure
between
the
shadow
cast
by
the
bordj
and
the
shadow
cast
by
the
palm
trees
stood
the
two
tents
on
a
patch
of
sand
the
oasis
was
enclosed
in
a
low
earth
wall
along
the
top
of
which
was
a
ragged
edging
of
brushwood
in
this
wall
were
several
gaps
through
one
opposite
to
the
tents
was
visible
a
shallow
pool
of
still
water
by
which
tall
reeds
were
growing
they
stood
up
like
spears
absolutely
motionless
a
frog
was
piping
from
some
hidden
place
giving
forth
a
clear
note
that
suggested
glass
it
reminded
domini
of
her
ride
into
the
desert
at
to
see
the
moon
rise
on
that
night
androvsky
had
told
her
that
he
was
going
away
that
had
been
the
night
of
his
tremendous
struggle
with
himself
when
he
had
spoken
she
had
felt
a
sensation
as
if
everything
that
supported
her
in
the
atmosphere
of
life
and
of
happiness
had
foundered
and
now
now
she
was
going
to
speak
to
him
to
tell
him
what
was
she
going
to
tell
him
how
much
could
she
dared
she
tell
him
she
prayed
silently
to
be
given
strength
in
the
clear
sky
the
young
moon
hung
beneath
it
to
the
left
was
one
star
like
an
attendant
the
star
of
venus
the
faint
light
of
the
moon
fell
upon
the
water
of
the
pool
unceasingly
the
frog
uttered
its
nocturne
domini
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
water
listening
then
she
glanced
up
at
the
moon
and
the
solitary
star
androvsky
stood
by
her
shall
we
let
us
sit
on
the
wall
where
the
gap
is
she
said
the
water
is
beautiful
beautiful
with
that
light
on
it
and
the
palms
palms
are
always
beautiful
especially
at
night
i
shall
never
love
any
other
trees
as
i
love
palm
nor
i
he
answered
they
sat
down
on
the
wall
at
first
they
did
not
speak
any
more
the
stillness
of
the
water
the
stillness
of
reeds
and
palms
was
against
speech
and
the
little
note
that
came
to
them
again
and
again
at
regular
intervals
was
like
a
magical
measuring
of
the
silence
of
the
night
in
the
desert
at
last
domini
said
in
a
low
voice
i
heard
that
note
on
the
night
when
i
rode
out
of
to
see
the
moon
rise
in
the
desert
boris
you
remember
that
night
yes
he
answered
he
was
gazing
at
the
pool
with
his
face
partly
averted
from
her
one
hand
on
the
wall
the
other
resting
on
his
knee
you
were
brave
that
night
boris
she
said
i
i
wished
to
be
i
tried
to
be
and
if
i
had
been
he
stopped
then
went
on
if
i
had
been
domini
really
brave
if
i
had
done
what
i
meant
to
do
that
night
what
would
our
lives
have
been
i
don
t
know
we
mustn
t
think
of
that
we
must
think
of
the
future
boris
there
s
no
life
no
real
life
without
bravery
no
man
or
woman
is
worthy
of
living
who
is
not
he
said
nothing
boris
let
us
you
and
i
be
worthy
of
living
and
in
the
give
me
your
hand
then
he
answered
give
it
me
but
she
did
not
give
it
to
him
instead
she
went
on
speaking
a
little
more
rapidly
boris
don
t
rely
too
much
on
my
strength
i
am
only
a
woman
and
i
have
to
struggle
i
have
had
to
struggle
more
than
perhaps
you
will
ever
know
you
must
not
make
make
things
impossible
for
me
i
am
trying
very
hard
to
i
m
you
must
not
touch
me
she
drew
a
little
farther
away
from
him
a
faint
breath
of
air
made
the
leaves
of
the
palm
trees
rustle
slightly
made
the
reeds
move
for
an
instant
by
the
pool
he
laid
his
hand
again
on
the
wall
from
which
he
had
lifted
it
there
was
a
pleading
sound
in
her
voice
which
made
him
feel
as
if
it
were
speaking
close
against
his
heart
i
said
i
would
tell
you
where
we
are
tell
me
we
are
going
back
to
we
are
not
very
far
off
from
not
very
we
are
going
to
he
repeated
in
a
dull
voice
we
are
he
sat
up
on
the
wall
looking
straight
into
her
face
why
he
said
his
voice
was
sharp
now
sharp
with
fear
boris
do
you
want
to
be
at
peace
not
with
me
but
with
god
do
you
want
to
get
rid
of
your
burden
of
misery
which
increases
i
know
it
day
by
day
how
can
i
he
said
hopelessly
isn
t
expiation
the
only
way
i
think
it
expiation
how
how
can
i
can
never
expiate
my
there
s
no
sin
that
can
not
be
expiated
god
isn
t
merciless
come
back
with
me
to
that
little
church
where
you
married
me
come
back
to
it
with
me
you
could
not
confess
to
the
to
father
beret
i
feel
as
if
i
knew
why
where
you
married
me
you
will
you
must
make
your
to
the
priest
who
to
father
roubier
there
was
fierce
protest
in
his
voice
it
does
not
matter
who
is
the
priest
who
will
receive
your
confession
only
make
it
there
make
it
in
the
church
at
where
you
married
that
was
your
purpose
that
is
where
you
are
taking
me
i
can
t
go
i
won
t
domini
think
what
you
are
doing
you
are
asking
too
much
i
feel
that
god
is
asking
that
of
you
don
t
refuse
i
can
not
go
at
where
we
where
everything
will
remind
us
ah
don
t
you
think
i
shall
feel
it
too
don
t
you
think
i
shall
suffer
he
felt
horribly
ashamed
when
she
said
that
bowed
down
with
an
overwhelming
weight
of
shame
but
our
lives
he
stammered
but
if
i
go
afterwards
if
i
make
my
confession
afterwards
afterwards
isn
t
it
enough
to
think
of
that
one
thing
isn
t
it
better
to
put
everything
else
every
other
thought
away
it
seems
so
clear
to
me
that
we
should
go
to
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
told
as
a
child
is
told
to
do
something
by
its
she
looked
up
into
the
clear
sky
i
am
sure
i
have
been
told
she
added
i
know
i
there
was
a
long
silence
between
them
androvsky
felt
that
he
did
not
dare
to
break
it
something
in
domini
s
face
and
voice
cast
out
from
him
the
instinct
of
revolt
of
protest
he
began
to
feel
exhausted
without
power
like
a
sick
man
who
is
being
carried
by
bearers
in
a
litter
and
who
looks
at
the
landscape
through
which
he
is
passing
with
listless
eyes
and
who
scarcely
has
the
force
to
care
whither
he
is
being
borne
domini
he
said
at
last
and
his
voice
sounded
very
tired
if
you
say
i
must
go
to
i
will
go
i
have
done
you
a
great
wrong
and
and
don
t
think
of
me
any
more
she
said
think
think
as
i
do
of
of
what
am
i
i
have
loved
you
i
shall
always
love
you
but
i
am
as
you
are
here
for
a
little
while
elsewhere
for
all
eternity
you
told
him
that
man
in
the
monastery
that
we
are
shadows
set
in
a
world
of
that
was
a
lie
he
interrupted
and
the
weariness
had
gone
out
of
his
voice
when
i
said
that
i
had
never
loved
i
had
never
loved
or
was
it
a
aren
t
we
perhaps
shadow
now
in
comparison
comparison
to
what
we
shall
be
isn
t
this
world
even
this
this
desert
this
pool
with
the
light
on
it
this
silence
of
the
night
around
us
isn
t
all
this
a
shadow
in
comparison
to
the
world
where
we
are
going
you
and
i
boris
i
think
if
we
are
brave
now
we
shall
be
together
in
that
world
but
if
we
are
cowards
now
i
think
i
am
sure
that
in
that
world
the
real
world
we
shall
be
separated
for
ever
you
and
i
whatever
we
may
be
whatever
we
may
have
done
at
least
are
one
thing
we
are
believers
we
don
t
think
this
is
all
if
we
did
it
would
be
different
but
we
can
t
change
the
truth
that
is
in
our
souls
and
as
we
can
t
change
it
we
must
live
by
it
we
must
act
by
it
we
can
t
do
anything
else
i
can
t
and
you
don
t
you
feel
don
t
you
know
that
you
can
t
he
said
i
feel
that
i
know
nothing
nothing
except
that
i
am
his
voice
broke
on
the
last
words
tears
were
shining
in
his
eyes
after
a
long
silence
he
said
domini
take
me
where
you
will
if
it
is
to
i
will
go
but
but
afterwards
afterwards
she
said
then
she
stopped
the
little
note
of
the
frog
sounded
again
and
again
by
the
still
water
among
the
reeds
the
moon
was
higher
in
the
sky
don
t
let
us
think
of
afterwards
boris
she
said
at
length
that
song
we
have
heard
together
that
song
we
love
no
one
but
god
and
i
knows
what
is
in
my
i
hear
it
now
so
often
always
almost
it
seems
to
gather
meaning
it
seems
to
god
knows
what
is
in
your
heart
and
mine
he
will
take
care
of
the
afterwards
perhaps
in
our
hearts
already
he
has
put
a
secret
knowledge
of
the
has
he
has
he
put
it
that
knowledge
into
yours
hush
she
said
they
spoke
no
more
that
night
chapter
xxix
the
caravan
of
domini
and
androvsky
was
leaving
arba
already
the
tents
and
the
attendants
with
the
camels
and
the
mules
were
winding
slowly
along
the
plain
through
the
scrub
in
the
direction
of
the
mountains
and
the
dark
shadow
which
indicated
the
oasis
of
batouch
was
with
them
domini
and
androvsky
were
going
to
be
alone
on
this
last
stage
of
their
desert
journey
they
had
mounted
their
horses
before
the
great
door
of
the
bordj
said
goodbye
to
the
sheikh
of
arba
scattered
some
money
among
the
ragged
arabs
gathered
to
watch
them
go
and
cast
one
last
look
behind
them
in
that
mutual
instinctive
look
back
they
were
both
bidding
a
silent
farewell
to
the
desert
that
had
sheltered
their
passion
surely
taken
part
in
the
joy
of
their
love
watched
the
sorrow
and
the
terror
grow
in
it
to
the
climax
at
amara
and
was
now
whispering
to
them
a
faint
and
mysterious
farewell
to
domini
the
desert
had
always
been
as
a
great
and
significant
personality
a
personality
that
had
called
her
persistently
to
come
to
it
now
as
she
turned
on
her
horse
she
felt
as
if
it
were
calling
her
no
longer
as
if
its
mission
to
her
were
accomplished
as
if
its
voice
had
sunk
into
a
deep
and
breathless
silence
she
wondered
if
androvsky
felt
this
too
but
she
did
not
ask
him
his
face
was
pale
and
severe
his
eyes
stared
into
the
distance
his
hands
lay
on
his
horse
s
neck
like
tired
things
with
no
more
power
to
grip
and
hold
his
lips
were
slightly
parted
and
she
heard
the
sound
of
his
breath
coming
and
going
like
the
breath
of
a
man
who
is
struggling
this
sound
warned
her
not
to
try
his
strength
or
hers
come
boris
she
said
and
her
voice
held
none
of
the
passionate
regret
that
was
in
her
heart
we
mustn
t
linger
or
it
will
be
night
before
we
reach
let
it
be
night
he
said
dark
night
the
horses
moved
slowly
on
descending
the
hill
on
which
stood
the
bordj
dark
dark
night
he
said
again
she
said
nothing
they
rode
into
the
plain
when
they
were
there
he
said
domini
do
you
understand
do
you
realise
what
boris
she
asked
quietly
all
that
we
are
leaving
yes
i
are
we
are
we
leaving
it
for
ever
we
must
not
think
of
how
can
we
help
it
what
else
can
we
think
of
can
one
govern
the
mind
surely
if
we
can
govern
the
sometimes
he
said
sometimes
i
wonder
he
looked
at
her
something
in
her
face
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
go
on
to
say
what
he
had
been
going
to
say
but
she
understood
the
unfinished
sentence
if
you
can
wonder
boris
she
said
you
don
t
know
me
you
don
t
know
me
at
all
domini
he
said
i
don
t
wonder
but
sometimes
i
understand
your
strength
and
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
scarcely
human
scarcely
the
strength
of
a
she
lifted
her
whip
and
pointed
to
the
dark
shadow
far
away
i
can
just
see
the
tower
she
said
can
t
you
i
will
not
look
he
said
i
can
not
if
you
can
you
are
stronger
than
i
when
i
remember
that
it
was
on
that
tower
you
first
spoke
to
me
oh
domini
if
we
could
only
go
back
it
is
in
our
power
we
have
only
to
draw
a
rein
and
and
i
look
at
the
tower
she
said
as
once
i
looked
at
the
desert
it
calls
us
the
shadow
of
the
palm
trees
calls
us
as
once
the
desert
but
the
voice
what
a
different
voice
can
you
listen
to
it
i
have
been
listening
to
it
ever
since
we
left
amara
yes
it
is
a
different
voice
but
we
must
obey
it
as
we
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
desert
don
t
you
feel
that
if
i
do
it
is
because
you
tell
me
to
feel
it
you
tell
me
that
i
must
feel
his
words
seemed
to
hurt
her
an
expression
of
pain
came
into
her
face
boris
she
said
don
t
make
me
regret
too
terribly
that
i
ever
came
into
your
life
when
you
speak
like
that
i
feel
almost
as
if
you
were
putting
me
in
the
place
of
of
i
feel
as
if
you
were
depending
upon
me
for
everything
that
you
are
doing
as
if
you
were
letting
your
own
will
fall
asleep
the
desert
brings
dreams
i
know
that
but
we
you
and
i
we
must
not
dream
any
a
dream
you
call
it
the
life
we
have
lived
together
our
desert
life
boris
i
only
mean
that
we
must
live
strongly
now
act
strongly
now
that
we
must
be
brave
i
have
always
felt
that
there
was
strength
in
strength
he
said
bitterly
yes
otherwise
i
could
never
have
loved
you
don
t
ever
prove
to
me
that
i
was
utterly
wrong
i
can
bear
a
great
deal
but
that
i
don
t
feel
as
if
i
could
bear
after
a
moment
he
answered
i
will
try
to
give
you
nothing
more
to
bear
for
and
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
upon
the
tower
with
a
sort
of
stern
intentness
as
a
man
looks
at
something
cruel
terrible
she
saw
him
do
this
let
us
ride
quicker
she
said
we
must
be
in
he
said
nothing
but
he
touched
his
horse
with
his
heel
his
eyes
were
always
fixed
upon
the
tower
as
if
they
feared
to
look
at
the
desert
any
more
she
understood
that
when
he
had
said
i
will
try
to
give
you
nothing
more
to
bear
for
me
he
had
not
spoken
idly
he
had
waked
up
from
the
egoism
of
his
despair
he
had
been
able
to
see
more
clearly
into
her
heart
to
feel
more
rightly
what
she
was
feeling
than
he
had
before
as
she
watched
him
watching
the
tower
she
had
a
sensation
that
a
bond
a
new
bond
between
them
was
chaining
them
together
in
a
new
way
was
it
not
a
bond
that
would
be
strong
and
lasting
that
the
future
whatever
it
held
would
not
be
able
to
break
ties
sacred
ties
that
had
bound
them
together
might
must
be
snapped
asunder
and
the
end
was
not
yet
she
saw
as
she
gazed
at
the
darkness
of
the
palms
of
a
greater
darkness
approaching
deeper
than
any
darkness
of
palms
than
any
darkness
of
night
but
now
she
saw
also
a
ray
of
light
in
the
gloom
the
light
of
the
dawning
strength
the
dawning
unselfishness
in
androvsky
and
she
resolved
to
fix
her
eyes
upon
it
as
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
tower
just
after
sunset
they
rode
into
in
advance
of
the
camp
which
they
had
passed
upon
their
way
to
the
right
were
the
trees
of
count
anteoni
s
garden
domini
felt
them
but
she
did
not
look
towards
them
nor
did
androvsky
they
kept
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
distance
of
the
white
road
only
when
they
reached
the
great
hotel
now
closed
and
deserted
did
she
glance
away
she
could
not
pass
the
tower
without
seeing
it
but
she
saw
it
through
a
mist
of
tears
and
her
hands
trembled
upon
the
reins
they
held
for
a
moment
she
felt
that
she
must
break
down
that
she
had
no
more
strength
left
in
her
but
they
came
to
the
statue
of
the
cardinal
holding
the
double
cross
towards
the
desert
like
a
weapon
and
she
looked
at
it
and
saw
the
christ
boris
she
whispered
there
is
the
christ
let
us
think
only
of
that
she
saw
him
look
at
it
steadily
you
remember
she
said
at
the
bottom
of
the
avenue
of
cypresses
at
obediens
usque
ad
mortem
yes
we
can
be
obedient
too
let
us
be
obedient
when
she
said
that
and
looked
at
him
androvsky
felt
as
if
he
were
on
his
knees
before
her
as
he
was
upon
his
knees
in
the
garden
when
he
could
not
go
away
but
he
felt
too
that
then
though
he
had
loved
her
he
had
not
known
how
to
love
her
how
to
love
anyone
she
had
taught
him
now
the
lesson
sank
into
his
heart
like
a
sword
and
like
balm
it
was
as
if
he
were
slain
and
healed
by
the
same
stroke
that
night
as
domini
lay
in
the
lonely
room
in
the
hotel
with
the
french
windows
open
to
the
verandah
she
heard
the
church
clock
chime
the
hour
and
the
distant
sound
of
the
african
hautboy
in
the
street
of
the
dancers
she
heard
again
the
two
voices
the
hautboy
was
barbarous
and
provocative
but
she
thought
that
it
was
no
more
shrill
with
a
persistent
triumph
presently
the
church
bell
chimed
again
was
it
the
bell
of
the
church
of
or
the
bell
of
the
chapel
of
or
was
it
not
rather
the
voice
of
the
great
religion
to
which
she
belonged
to
which
androvsky
was
returning
when
it
ceased
she
whispered
to
herself
obediens
usque
ad
mortem
and
with
these
words
upon
her
lips
towards
dawn
she
fell
asleep
they
had
dined
upstairs
in
the
little
room
that
had
formerly
been
domini
s
salon
and
had
not
seen
father
roubier
who
always
came
to
the
hotel
to
take
his
evening
meal
in
the
morning
after
they
had
breakfasted
androvsky
said
domini
i
will
go
i
will
go
he
got
up
and
stood
by
her
looking
down
at
her
in
his
face
there
was
a
sort
of
sternness
a
set
expression
to
father
roubier
boris
she
said
yes
before
i
go
won
t
you
won
t
you
give
me
your
hand
she
understood
all
the
agony
of
spirit
he
was
enduring
all
the
shame
against
which
he
was
fighting
she
longed
to
spring
up
to
take
him
in
her
arms
to
comfort
him
as
only
the
woman
he
loves
and
who
loves
him
can
comfort
a
man
without
words
by
the
pressure
of
her
arms
the
pressure
of
her
lips
the
beating
of
her
heart
against
his
heart
she
longed
to
do
this
so
ardently
that
she
moved
restlessly
looking
up
at
him
with
a
light
in
her
eyes
that
he
had
never
seen
in
them
before
not
even
when
they
watched
the
fire
dying
down
at
arba
but
she
did
not
lift
her
hand
to
his
boris
she
said
go
god
will
be
with
after
a
moment
she
added
and
all
my
he
stood
as
if
waiting
a
long
time
she
had
ceased
from
moving
and
had
withdrawn
her
eyes
from
his
in
his
soul
a
voice
was
saying
if
she
does
not
touch
you
now
she
will
never
touch
you
and
he
waited
he
could
not
help
waiting
boris
she
whispered
he
said
come
to
me
afterwards
come
to
me
in
the
garden
i
shall
be
there
where
we
i
shall
be
there
waiting
for
he
went
out
without
another
word
when
he
was
gone
she
went
on
to
the
verandah
quickly
and
looked
over
the
parapet
she
saw
him
come
out
from
beneath
the
arcade
and
walk
slowly
across
the
road
to
the
little
gate
of
the
enclosure
before
the
house
of
the
priest
as
he
lifted
his
hands
to
open
the
gate
there
was
the
sound
of
a
bark
and
she
saw
run
out
with
a
manner
of
stern
inquiry
which
quickly
changed
to
joyful
welcome
as
he
recognised
an
old
acquaintance
androvsky
bent
down
took
up
the
little
dog
in
his
arms
and
holding
him
walked
to
the
house
door
in
a
moment
it
was
opened
and
he
went
in
then
domini
set
out
towards
the
garden
avoiding
the
village
street
and
taking
a
byway
which
skirted
the
desert
she
walked
quickly
she
longed
to
be
within
the
shadows
of
the
garden
behind
the
white
wall
she
did
not
feel
much
think
much
as
she
walked
without
knowing
it
she
was
holding
all
her
nature
the
whole
of
herself
fiercely
in
check
she
did
not
look
about
her
did
not
see
the
sunlit
reaches
of
the
desert
or
the
walls
of
the
houses
of
or
the
palm
trees
only
when
she
had
passed
the
hotel
and
the
negro
village
and
turned
to
the
left
to
the
track
at
the
edge
of
which
the
villa
of
count
anteoni
stood
did
she
lift
her
eyes
from
the
ground
they
rested
on
the
white
arcade
framing
the
fierce
blue
of
the
cloudless
sky
she
stopped
short
her
nature
seemed
to
escape
from
the
leash
by
which
she
had
held
it
in
with
a
rush
to
leap
forward
to
be
in
the
garden
and
in
the
past
in
the
past
with
its
passion
and
its
fiery
hopes
its
magnificent
looking
forward
its
holy
desires
of
joy
that
would
crown
her
woman
s
life
of
love
that
would
teach
her
all
the
depth
and
the
height
and
the
force
and
the
submission
of
her
womanhood
and
then
from
that
past
it
strove
on
into
the
present
the
shock
was
as
the
shock
of
battle
there
were
noises
in
her
ears
voices
clamouring
in
her
heart
all
her
pulses
throbbed
like
hammers
and
then
suddenly
she
felt
as
weak
as
a
little
sick
child
and
as
if
she
must
lie
down
there
on
the
dust
of
the
white
road
in
the
sunshine
lie
down
and
die
at
the
edge
of
the
desert
that
had
treated
her
cruelly
that
had
slain
the
hopes
it
had
given
to
her
and
brought
into
her
heart
this
terrible
despair
for
now
she
knew
a
moment
of
utter
despair
in
which
all
things
seemed
to
dissolve
into
atoms
and
sink
down
out
of
her
sight
she
stood
quivering
in
blackness
she
stood
absolutely
alone
more
absolutely
alone
than
any
woman
had
ever
been
than
any
human
being
had
ever
been
she
seemed
presently
as
the
blackness
faded
into
something
pale
like
a
ghastly
twilight
to
see
herself
her
wraith
as
it
were
standing
in
a
vast
landscape
vast
as
the
desert
companionless
lost
forgotten
out
of
mind
watching
for
something
that
would
never
come
listening
for
some
voice
that
was
hushed
in
eternal
silence
that
was
to
be
her
life
she
thought
could
she
face
it
could
she
endure
it
and
everything
within
her
said
to
her
that
she
could
not
and
then
just
then
when
she
felt
that
she
must
sink
down
and
give
up
the
battle
of
life
she
seemed
to
see
by
her
side
a
shape
a
little
shape
like
a
child
and
it
lifted
up
a
hand
to
her
hand
and
she
knew
that
the
vast
landscape
was
god
s
garden
the
garden
of
allah
and
that
no
day
no
night
could
ever
pass
without
god
walking
in
it
hearing
a
knock
upon
the
great
gate
of
the
garden
smain
uncurled
himself
on
his
mat
within
the
tent
rose
lazily
to
his
feet
and
without
a
rose
strolled
languidly
to
open
to
the
visitor
domini
stood
without
when
he
saw
her
he
smiled
quietly
with
no
surprise
madame
has
returned
domini
smiled
at
him
but
her
lips
were
trembling
and
she
said
nothing
smain
observed
her
with
a
dawning
of
curiosity
madame
is
changed
he
said
at
length
madame
looks
tired
the
sun
is
hot
in
the
desert
now
it
is
better
here
in
the
with
an
effort
she
controlled
herself
yes
smain
she
answered
it
is
better
here
but
i
can
not
stay
here
you
are
going
away
yes
i
am
going
she
saw
more
quiet
questions
fluttering
on
his
lips
and
added
and
now
i
want
to
walk
in
the
garden
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
trees
it
is
all
for
madame
monsieur
the
count
has
always
said
so
but
monsieur
he
is
in
he
is
coming
presently
to
fetch
then
she
turned
away
and
walked
slowly
across
the
great
sweep
of
sand
towards
the
trees
and
was
taken
by
their
darkness
she
heard
again
the
liquid
bubbling
of
the
hidden
waterfall
and
was
again
companioned
by
the
mystery
of
this
desert
paradise
but
it
no
longer
whispered
to
her
of
peace
for
her
it
murmured
only
its
own
personal
peace
and
accentuated
her
own
personal
agony
and
struggle
all
that
it
had
been
it
still
was
but
all
that
she
had
been
in
it
was
changed
and
she
felt
the
full
terror
of
nature
s
equanimity
environing
the
fierce
and
tortured
lives
of
men
as
she
walked
towards
the
deepest
recesses
of
the
garden
along
the
winding
tracks
between
the
rills
she
had
no
sensation
of
approaching
the
hidden
home
of
the
geni
of
the
garden
yet
she
remembered
acutely
all
her
first
feelings
there
not
one
was
forgotten
they
returned
to
her
like
spectres
stealing
across
the
sand
they
lurked
like
spectres
among
the
dense
masses
of
the
trees
she
strove
not
to
see
their
pale
shapes
not
to
hear
their
terrible
voices
she
strove
to
draw
calm
once
more
from
this
infinite
calm
of
things
aspiring
towards
the
sun
but
with
each
step
she
took
the
torment
in
her
heart
increased
at
last
she
came
to
the
deeper
darkness
and
the
blanched
sand
and
saw
pine
needles
strewed
about
her
feet
then
she
stood
still
instinctively
listening
for
a
sound
that
would
complete
the
magic
of
the
garden
and
her
own
despair
she
waited
for
it
she
even
felt
strangely
that
she
wanted
that
she
needed
it
the
sound
of
the
flute
of
larbi
playing
his
amorous
tune
but
his
flute
was
silent
had
he
fallen
out
of
an
old
love
and
not
yet
found
a
new
or
had
he
perhaps
gone
away
or
was
he
dead
for
a
long
time
she
stood
there
thinking
about
larbi
he
and
his
flute
and
his
love
were
mingled
with
her
life
in
the
desert
and
she
felt
that
she
could
not
leave
the
desert
without
bidding
them
farewell
but
the
silence
lasted
and
she
went
on
and
came
to
the
she
went
into
it
at
once
and
sat
down
she
was
going
to
wait
for
androvsky
here
her
mind
was
straying
curiously
suddenly
she
found
herself
thinking
of
the
fanatical
religious
performance
she
had
seen
with
hadj
on
the
night
when
she
had
ridden
out
to
watch
the
moon
rise
she
saw
in
imagination
the
bowing
bodies
the
foaming
mouths
the
glassy
eyes
of
the
young
priests
of
the
sahara
she
saw
the
spikes
behind
their
eyeballs
the
struggling
scorpions
descending
into
their
throats
the
flaming
coals
under
their
the
nails
driven
into
their
heads
she
heard
them
growling
as
they
saw
the
glass
like
hungry
beasts
at
the
sight
of
meat
and
all
this
was
to
them
religion
this
madness
was
their
conception
of
worship
a
voice
seemed
to
whisper
to
her
and
your
madness
it
was
like
the
voice
that
whispered
to
androvsky
in
the
cemetery
of
come
out
with
me
into
that
world
that
beautiful
world
which
god
made
for
men
why
do
you
reject
it
for
a
moment
she
saw
all
religions
all
the
practices
the
renunciations
of
the
religions
of
the
world
as
varying
forms
of
madness
she
compared
the
of
the
monk
with
the
fetish
worship
of
the
savage
and
a
wild
thrill
of
something
that
was
almost
like
joy
rushed
through
her
the
joy
that
sometimes
comes
to
the
unbelievers
when
they
are
about
to
commit
some
act
which
they
feel
would
be
contrary
to
god
s
will
if
there
were
a
god
it
was
a
thrill
of
almost
insolent
human
emancipation
the
soul
cried
out
i
have
no
master
when
i
thought
i
had
a
master
i
was
mad
now
i
am
but
it
passed
almost
as
it
came
like
a
false
thing
slinking
from
the
sunlight
and
domini
bowed
her
head
in
the
obscurity
of
count
anteoni
s
and
returned
to
her
true
self
that
moment
had
been
like
the
moment
upon
the
tower
when
she
saw
below
her
the
jewess
dancing
upon
the
roof
for
the
soldiers
a
black
speck
settling
for
an
instant
upon
whiteness
then
carried
away
by
a
purifying
wind
she
knew
that
she
would
always
be
subject
to
such
moments
so
long
as
she
was
a
human
being
that
there
would
always
be
in
her
blood
something
that
was
otherwise
would
she
not
be
already
in
paradise
she
sat
and
prayed
for
strength
in
the
battle
of
life
that
could
never
be
anything
else
but
a
battle
at
last
something
within
her
told
her
to
look
up
to
look
out
through
the
into
the
garden
she
had
not
heard
a
step
but
she
knew
that
androvsky
was
approaching
and
as
she
looked
up
she
prepared
herself
for
a
sight
that
would
be
terrible
she
remembered
his
face
when
he
came
to
bid
her
in
the
garden
and
she
feared
to
see
his
face
now
but
she
schooled
herself
to
be
strong
for
herself
and
for
him
he
was
near
her
on
the
path
coming
towards
her
as
she
saw
him
she
uttered
a
little
cry
and
stood
up
an
immense
surprise
came
to
her
followed
in
a
moment
by
an
immense
joy
the
greatest
joy
she
thought
that
she
had
ever
experienced
for
she
looked
on
a
face
in
which
she
saw
for
the
first
time
a
pale
dawning
of
peace
there
was
sadness
in
it
there
was
awe
but
there
was
a
light
of
calm
such
as
sometimes
settles
upon
the
faces
of
men
who
have
died
quietly
without
agony
or
fear
and
she
felt
fully
as
she
saw
it
the
rapture
of
having
refused
cowardice
and
grasped
the
hand
of
bravery
directly
afterwards
there
came
to
her
a
sensation
of
wonder
that
at
this
moment
of
their
lives
she
and
androvsky
should
be
capable
of
a
feeling
of
joy
of
peace
when
the
wonder
passed
it
was
as
if
she
had
seen
god
and
knew
for
ever
the
meaning
of
his
divine
compensations
androvsky
came
to
the
doorway
of
the
without
looking
up
stood
still
there
just
where
count
anteoni
had
stood
during
his
first
interview
with
domini
and
said
domini
i
have
been
to
the
priest
i
have
made
my
yes
she
said
yes
boris
he
came
into
the
and
sat
down
near
her
but
not
close
to
her
on
one
of
the
divans
now
the
sad
look
in
his
face
had
deepened
and
the
peace
seemed
to
be
fading
she
had
thought
of
the
dawn
that
pale
light
which
is
growing
into
day
now
she
thought
of
the
twilight
which
is
fading
into
night
and
the
terrible
knowledge
struck
her
i
am
the
troubler
of
his
peace
without
me
only
could
he
ever
regain
fully
the
peace
which
he
has
domini
he
said
looking
up
at
her
you
know
the
rest
you
meant
it
to
be
as
it
will
be
when
we
left
was
there
any
other
way
was
there
any
other
possible
life
for
us
for
you
for
me
for
you
he
said
and
there
was
a
sound
almost
of
despair
in
his
voice
but
what
is
to
be
your
life
i
have
never
protected
you
you
have
protected
me
i
have
never
been
strong
for
you
you
have
been
strong
for
me
but
to
leave
you
all
alone
domini
must
i
do
that
must
i
think
of
you
out
in
the
world
alone
for
a
moment
she
was
tempted
to
break
her
silence
to
tell
him
the
truth
that
she
would
perhaps
not
be
alone
that
another
life
sprung
from
his
and
hers
was
coming
to
be
with
her
was
coming
to
share
the
great
loneliness
that
lay
before
her
but
she
resisted
the
temptation
and
only
said
do
not
think
of
me
you
tell
me
not
to
think
of
you
he
said
with
an
almost
fierce
wonder
do
you
do
you
wish
me
not
to
think
of
you
what
i
wish
that
is
so
little
but
no
boris
i
can
t
say
i
don
t
think
i
could
ever
truly
say
that
i
wish
you
to
think
no
more
of
me
after
all
one
has
a
heart
and
i
think
if
it
s
worth
anything
it
must
be
often
a
rebellious
heart
i
know
mine
is
rebellious
but
if
you
don
t
think
too
much
of
me
when
you
are
there
she
paused
and
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
she
continued
surely
it
will
be
easier
for
you
happier
for
androvsky
clenched
his
right
hand
on
the
divan
and
turned
round
till
he
was
facing
her
full
his
eyes
blazed
domini
he
said
you
are
truthful
i
ll
be
truthful
to
you
till
the
end
of
my
life
i
ll
think
of
you
every
day
every
hour
if
it
were
mortal
sin
to
think
of
you
i
would
commit
it
yes
domini
deliberately
i
would
commit
it
but
god
doesn
t
ask
so
much
of
us
no
god
doesn
t
i
ve
made
my
confession
i
know
what
i
must
do
i
ll
do
it
you
are
right
you
are
always
right
you
are
guided
i
know
that
but
i
will
think
of
you
and
i
ll
tell
you
something
don
t
shirk
from
it
because
it
s
truth
the
truth
of
my
soul
and
you
love
truth
domini
suddenly
he
got
up
from
the
divan
and
stood
before
her
looking
down
at
her
steadily
domini
i
can
t
regret
that
i
have
seen
you
that
we
have
been
together
that
we
have
loved
each
other
that
we
do
love
each
other
for
ever
i
can
t
regret
it
i
can
t
even
try
or
wish
to
i
can
t
regret
that
i
have
learned
from
you
the
meaning
of
life
i
know
that
god
has
punished
me
for
what
i
have
done
in
my
love
for
you
till
i
told
you
the
truth
that
other
truth
i
never
had
a
moment
of
peace
of
exultation
yes
of
passionate
exultation
but
never
never
a
moment
of
peace
for
always
even
in
the
most
beautiful
moments
there
has
been
agony
for
me
for
always
i
have
known
that
i
was
sinning
against
god
and
you
against
myself
my
eternal
vows
and
yet
now
i
tell
you
domini
as
i
have
told
god
since
i
have
been
able
to
pray
again
that
i
am
glad
thankful
that
i
have
loved
you
been
loved
by
you
is
it
wicked
i
don
t
know
i
can
scarcely
even
care
because
it
s
true
and
how
can
i
deny
the
truth
strive
against
truth
i
am
as
i
am
and
i
am
that
god
has
made
me
that
god
will
forgive
me
for
being
as
i
am
i
m
not
afraid
i
believe
i
dare
to
believe
that
he
wishes
me
to
think
of
you
always
till
the
end
of
my
life
i
dare
to
believe
that
he
would
almost
hate
me
if
i
could
ever
cease
from
loving
you
that
s
my
other
confession
my
confession
to
you
i
was
born
perhaps
to
be
a
monk
but
i
was
born
too
that
i
might
love
you
and
know
your
love
your
beauty
your
tenderness
your
divinity
if
i
had
not
known
you
if
i
had
died
a
monk
a
good
monk
who
had
never
denied
his
vows
i
should
have
died
i
feel
it
domini
in
a
great
a
terrible
ignorance
i
should
have
known
the
goodness
of
god
but
i
should
never
have
known
part
a
beautiful
part
of
his
goodness
for
i
should
never
have
known
the
goodness
that
he
has
put
into
you
he
has
taught
me
through
you
he
has
tortured
me
through
you
yes
but
through
you
too
he
has
made
me
understand
him
when
i
was
in
the
monastery
when
i
was
at
peace
when
i
lost
myself
in
prayer
when
i
was
absolutely
pure
absolutely
so
i
thought
the
child
of
god
i
never
really
knew
god
now
domini
now
i
know
him
in
the
worst
moments
of
the
new
agony
that
i
must
meet
at
least
i
shall
always
have
that
help
i
shall
always
feel
that
i
know
what
god
is
i
shall
always
when
i
think
of
you
when
i
remember
you
be
able
to
say
god
is
he
was
silent
but
his
face
still
spoke
to
her
his
eyes
read
her
eyes
and
in
that
moment
at
last
they
understood
each
other
fully
and
for
ever
it
was
written
that
was
domini
s
thought
it
was
written
by
far
away
the
church
bell
chimed
boris
domini
said
quietly
we
must
go
we
must
leave
you
know
that
yes
he
said
i
he
looked
out
into
the
garden
the
almost
fierce
resolution
that
had
something
in
it
of
triumph
faded
from
him
yes
he
said
this
is
the
end
the
real
end
for
there
it
will
all
be
different
it
will
be
let
us
sit
here
for
a
little
while
together
domini
said
and
be
quiet
is
it
like
the
garden
of
boris
no
but
when
i
first
came
here
when
i
saw
the
white
walls
the
great
door
when
i
saw
the
poor
arabs
gathered
there
to
receive
alms
it
made
me
feel
almost
as
if
i
were
at
that
was
why
he
paused
i
understand
boris
i
understand
everything
and
then
they
were
silent
such
a
silence
as
theirs
was
then
could
never
be
interpreted
to
others
in
it
the
sorrows
the
aspirations
the
struggles
the
triumphs
the
torturing
regrets
the
brave
determinations
of
poor
great
feeble
noble
humanity
were
enclosed
as
in
a
casket
a
casket
which
contains
many
kinds
of
jewels
but
surely
none
that
are
not
precious
and
the
garden
listened
and
beyond
the
garden
the
desert
listened
that
other
garden
of
allah
and
in
this
garden
was
not
allah
too
listening
to
this
silence
of
his
children
this
last
mutual
silence
of
theirs
in
the
garden
where
they
had
wandered
where
they
had
loved
where
they
had
learned
a
great
lesson
and
drawn
near
to
a
great
victory
they
might
have
sat
thus
for
hours
they
had
lost
all
count
of
time
but
presently
in
the
distance
among
the
trees
there
rose
a
light
frail
sound
that
struck
into
both
their
hearts
like
a
thin
weapon
it
was
the
flute
of
larbi
and
it
reminded
them
of
what
did
it
not
remind
them
all
their
passionate
love
of
the
body
all
their
lawlessness
all
the
joy
of
liberty
and
of
life
of
the
barbaric
life
that
is
liberty
all
their
wandering
in
the
great
spaces
of
the
sun
were
set
before
them
in
larbi
s
fluttering
tune
that
was
like
the
call
of
a
siren
the
call
of
danger
the
call
of
earth
and
of
earthly
things
summoning
them
to
abandon
the
summons
of
the
spirit
domini
got
up
swiftly
come
boris
she
said
without
looking
at
him
he
obeyed
her
and
rose
to
his
feet
let
us
go
to
the
wall
she
said
and
look
out
once
more
on
the
desert
it
must
be
nearly
noon
perhaps
perhaps
we
shall
hear
the
call
to
they
walked
down
the
winding
alleys
towards
the
edge
of
the
garden
the
sound
of
the
flute
of
larbi
died
away
gradually
into
silence
soon
they
saw
before
them
the
great
spaces
of
the
sahara
flooded
with
the
blinding
glory
of
the
summer
sunlight
they
stood
and
looked
out
over
it
from
the
shelter
of
some
pepper
trees
no
caravans
were
passing
no
arabs
were
visible
the
desert
seemed
utterly
empty
given
over
naked
to
the
dominion
of
the
sun
while
they
stood
there
the
nasal
voice
of
the
mueddin
rose
from
the
minaret
of
the
mosque
of
uttered
its
fourfold
cry
and
died
away
boris
domini
said
that
is
for
the
arabs
but
for
us
too
for
we
belong
to
the
garden
of
allah
as
they
do
perhaps
even
more
than
yes
she
remembered
how
long
ago
count
anteoni
had
stood
there
with
her
and
repeated
the
words
of
the
angel
to
the
prophet
and
she
murmured
them
now
o
thou
that
art
covered
arise
and
magnify
thy
lord
and
purify
thy
clothes
and
depart
from
then
standing
side
by
side
they
prayed
looking
at
the
desert
chapter
xxx
in
the
evening
of
that
day
they
left
domini
wished
to
go
quietly
but
knowing
the
arabs
she
feared
it
would
be
impossible
nevertheless
when
she
paid
batouch
in
the
hotel
and
thanked
him
for
all
his
services
she
said
we
ll
say
adieu
here
the
poet
displayed
a
large
surprise
but
i
will
accompany
madame
to
the
station
i
will
it
is
not
batouch
looked
offended
but
obstinate
his
ample
person
became
almost
rigid
if
i
am
not
at
the
station
madame
what
will
hadj
think
and
ali
and
ouardi
and
they
will
be
there
of
course
madame
where
else
should
they
be
does
madame
wish
to
leave
us
like
a
thief
in
the
night
or
like
no
no
batouch
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
all
but
especially
to
batouch
began
to
smile
madame
has
entered
into
our
hearts
as
no
other
stranger
has
ever
done
he
remarked
madame
understands
the
arabs
we
shall
all
come
to
say
and
to
wish
madame
and
monsieur
a
happy
for
the
moment
the
irony
of
her
situation
struck
domini
so
forcibly
that
she
could
say
nothing
she
only
looked
at
batouch
in
silence
what
is
it
but
i
know
madame
is
sad
at
leaving
the
desert
at
leaving
yes
batouch
i
am
sad
at
leaving
but
madame
will
return
who
knows
i
know
the
desert
has
a
spell
he
who
has
once
seen
the
desert
must
see
it
again
the
desert
calls
and
its
voice
is
always
heard
madame
will
hear
it
when
she
is
far
away
and
some
day
she
will
feel
i
must
come
back
to
the
land
of
the
sun
and
to
the
beautiful
land
of
i
shall
see
you
at
the
station
batouch
domini
said
quickly
till
the
train
for
tunis
started
at
sundown
in
order
that
the
travellers
might
avoid
the
intense
heat
of
the
day
all
the
afternoon
they
kept
within
doors
the
arabs
were
sleeping
in
dark
rooms
the
gardens
were
deserted
domini
could
not
sleep
she
sat
near
the
french
window
that
opened
on
to
the
verandah
and
said
a
silent
to
life
for
that
was
what
she
felt
that
life
was
leaving
her
life
with
its
intensity
its
fierce
meaning
she
had
come
out
of
a
sort
of
death
to
find
life
in
and
now
she
felt
that
she
was
going
back
again
to
something
that
would
be
like
death
after
her
strife
there
came
a
numbness
of
the
spirit
a
heavy
dullness
time
passed
and
she
sat
there
without
moving
sometimes
she
looked
at
the
trunks
lying
on
the
floor
ready
for
the
journey
at
the
labels
on
which
was
written
tunis
and
then
she
tried
to
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
to
travel
in
the
train
after
her
long
travelling
in
the
desert
and
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
in
a
city
but
she
could
not
the
heat
was
intense
perhaps
it
affected
her
mind
through
her
body
faintly
far
down
in
her
mind
and
heart
she
knew
that
she
was
wishing
even
longing
to
realise
all
that
these
last
hours
in
meant
to
gather
up
in
them
all
the
threads
of
her
life
and
her
sensations
there
to
survey
as
from
a
height
the
panorama
of
the
change
that
had
come
to
her
in
africa
but
she
was
frustrated
the
hours
fled
and
she
remained
cold
listless
often
she
was
hardly
thinking
at
all
when
the
arab
servant
came
in
to
tell
her
that
it
was
time
to
start
for
the
station
she
got
up
slowly
and
looked
at
him
vaguely
time
to
go
already
she
asked
yes
madame
i
have
told
very
at
this
moment
androvsky
came
into
the
room
the
carriage
is
waiting
he
said
she
felt
almost
as
if
a
stranger
was
speaking
to
her
i
am
ready
she
said
and
without
looking
round
the
room
she
went
downstairs
and
got
into
the
carriage
they
drove
to
the
station
without
speaking
she
had
not
seen
father
roubier
androvsky
took
the
tickets
when
they
came
out
upon
the
platform
they
found
there
a
small
crowd
of
arab
friends
with
batouch
in
command
among
them
were
the
servants
who
had
accompanied
them
upon
their
desert
journey
and
hadj
he
came
forward
smiling
to
shake
hands
when
she
saw
him
domini
remembered
irena
and
forgetting
that
it
is
not
etiquette
to
inquire
after
an
arab
s
womenfolk
she
said
ah
hadj
and
are
you
happy
now
how
is
irena
hadj
s
face
fell
and
he
showed
his
pointed
teeth
in
a
snarl
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
looking
round
at
the
other
arabs
then
he
said
i
am
always
happy
domini
saw
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
she
took
out
her
purse
and
gave
him
five
francs
a
parting
present
she
said
hadj
shook
his
head
with
recovered
cheerfulness
tucked
in
his
chin
and
laughed
domini
turned
away
shook
hands
with
all
her
dark
acquaintances
and
climbed
up
into
the
train
followed
by
androvsky
batouch
sprang
upon
the
step
as
the
porter
shut
the
door
madame
he
exclaimed
what
is
it
batouch
you
have
put
hadj
to
he
smiled
broadly
i
how
what
have
i
done
irena
is
dancing
at
onargla
far
away
in
the
desert
beyond
irena
but
she
could
not
live
shut
up
in
a
room
she
could
not
wear
the
veil
for
but
then
she
has
divorced
him
madame
it
is
easy
here
for
a
few
francs
one
can
the
whistle
sounded
the
train
jerked
batouch
seized
her
hand
seized
androvsky
s
sprang
back
to
the
platform
batouch
ouardi
smain
the
train
moved
on
as
it
reached
the
end
of
the
platform
domini
saw
an
emaciated
figure
standing
there
alone
a
thin
face
with
glittering
eyes
turned
towards
her
with
a
glaring
scrutiny
it
was
the
he
smiled
at
her
and
his
smile
contracted
the
wound
upon
his
face
making
it
look
wicked
and
grotesque
like
the
face
of
a
demon
she
sank
down
on
the
seat
for
a
moment
a
hideous
moment
she
felt
as
if
he
personified
as
if
this
smile
were
s
farewell
to
her
and
to
androvsky
and
irena
was
dancing
at
onargla
far
away
in
the
desert
she
remembered
the
night
in
the
irena
s
attack
upon
hadj
that
love
of
africa
was
at
an
end
was
not
everything
at
an
end
yet
larbi
still
played
upon
his
flute
in
the
garden
of
count
anteoni
still
played
the
little
tune
that
was
as
the
of
the
eternal
renewal
of
life
and
within
herself
she
carried
god
s
mystery
of
renewal
even
she
with
her
numbed
mind
her
tired
heart
she
too
was
to
help
to
carry
forward
the
banner
of
life
she
had
come
to
in
the
sunset
and
now
in
the
sunset
she
was
leaving
it
but
she
did
not
lean
from
the
carriage
window
to
watch
the
pageant
that
was
flaming
in
the
west
instead
she
shut
her
eyes
and
remembered
it
as
it
was
on
that
evening
when
they
who
now
were
journeying
away
from
the
desert
together
had
been
journeying
towards
it
together
strangers
who
had
never
spoken
to
each
other
and
the
evening
came
and
the
train
stole
into
the
gorge
of
and
still
she
kept
her
eyes
closed
only
when
the
desert
was
finally
left
behind
divided
from
them
by
the
great
wall
of
rock
did
she
look
up
and
speak
to
androvsky
we
met
here
boris
she
said
yes
he
answered
at
the
gate
of
the
desert
i
shall
never
be
here
soon
the
night
fell
around
them
in
the
evening
of
the
following
day
they
reached
tunis
and
drove
to
the
hotel
d
orient
where
they
had
written
to
engage
rooms
for
one
night
they
had
expected
that
the
city
would
be
almost
deserted
by
its
european
inhabitants
now
the
summer
had
set
in
but
when
they
drove
up
to
the
door
of
the
hotel
the
proprietor
came
out
to
inform
them
that
owing
to
the
arrival
of
a
ship
full
of
american
tourists
who
personally
conducted
were
viewing
tunis
after
an
excursion
to
the
east
and
to
the
holy
land
he
had
been
unable
to
keep
for
them
a
private
with
many
apologies
he
explained
that
all
the
in
the
house
had
been
turned
into
bedrooms
but
only
for
one
night
on
the
morrow
the
ones
would
depart
and
madame
and
monsieur
could
have
a
charming
salon
they
listened
silently
to
his
explanations
and
apologies
standing
in
the
narrow
entrance
hall
which
was
blocked
up
with
piles
of
luggage
tomorrow
he
kept
on
repeating
all
would
be
different
domini
glanced
at
androvsky
who
stood
with
his
head
bent
down
looking
on
the
ground
shall
we
try
another
hotel
she
asked
if
you
wish
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
it
would
be
useless
madame
said
the
proprietor
all
the
hotels
are
full
in
the
others
you
will
not
find
even
a
perhaps
we
had
better
stay
here
she
said
to
androvsky
her
voice
too
was
low
and
tired
in
her
heart
something
seemed
to
say
do
not
strive
any
more
in
the
garden
it
was
finished
already
you
are
face
to
face
with
the
when
she
was
alone
in
her
small
bedroom
which
was
full
of
the
noises
of
the
street
and
had
washed
and
put
on
another
dress
she
began
to
realise
how
much
she
had
secretly
been
counting
on
one
more
evening
alone
with
androvsky
she
had
imagined
herself
dining
with
him
in
their
unwatched
sitting
together
afterwards
for
an
hour
or
two
in
silence
perhaps
but
at
least
alone
she
had
imagined
a
last
solitude
with
him
with
the
darkness
of
the
african
night
around
them
she
had
counted
upon
that
she
realised
it
now
her
whole
heart
and
soul
had
been
asking
for
that
believing
that
at
least
that
would
be
granted
to
her
but
it
was
not
to
be
she
must
go
down
with
him
into
a
crowd
of
american
tourists
must
her
heart
sickened
it
seemed
to
her
for
a
moment
that
if
only
she
could
have
this
one
more
evening
quietly
with
the
man
she
loved
she
could
brace
herself
to
bear
anything
afterwards
but
that
if
she
could
not
have
it
she
must
break
down
she
felt
desperate
a
gong
sounded
below
she
did
not
move
though
she
heard
it
knew
what
it
meant
after
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
what
is
it
she
said
dinner
is
ready
madame
said
a
voice
in
english
with
a
strong
foreign
accent
domini
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
does
monsieur
know
monsieur
is
already
in
the
hall
waiting
for
she
went
down
and
found
androvsky
they
dined
at
a
small
table
in
a
room
fiercely
lit
up
with
electric
light
and
restless
with
revolving
fans
close
to
them
at
an
immense
table
decorated
with
flowers
dined
the
american
tourists
the
women
wore
hats
with
large
hanging
veils
the
men
were
in
travelling
suits
they
looked
sunburnt
and
gay
and
talked
and
laughed
with
an
intense
vivacity
afterwards
they
were
going
in
a
body
to
see
the
dances
of
the
almees
androvsky
shot
one
glance
at
them
as
he
came
in
then
looked
away
quickly
the
lines
near
his
mouth
deepened
for
a
moment
he
shut
his
eyes
domini
did
not
speak
to
him
did
not
attempt
to
talk
enveloped
by
the
nasal
uproar
of
the
gay
tourists
they
ate
in
silence
when
the
short
meal
was
over
they
got
up
and
went
out
into
the
hall
the
public
opened
out
of
it
on
the
left
they
looked
into
it
and
saw
red
plush
settees
a
large
centre
table
covered
with
a
rummage
of
newspapers
a
jew
with
a
bald
head
writing
a
letter
and
two
old
german
ladies
with
caps
drinking
coffee
and
knitting
stockings
the
desert
androvsky
whispered
suddenly
he
drew
away
from
the
door
and
walked
out
into
the
street
lines
of
carriages
stood
there
waiting
to
be
hired
he
beckoned
to
one
a
victoria
with
a
pair
of
small
arab
horses
when
it
was
in
front
of
the
hotel
he
said
to
domini
will
you
get
in
domini
she
obeyed
androvsky
said
to
the
mettse
driver
drive
to
the
belvedere
drive
round
the
park
till
i
tell
you
to
the
man
whipped
his
horses
and
they
rattled
down
the
broad
street
past
the
cafes
the
cercle
militaire
the
palace
of
the
resident
where
zouaves
were
standing
turned
to
the
left
and
were
soon
out
on
a
road
where
a
tram
line
stretched
between
villas
waste
ground
and
flat
fields
in
front
of
them
rose
a
hill
with
a
darkness
of
trees
scattered
over
it
they
reached
it
and
began
to
mount
it
slowly
the
lights
of
the
city
shone
below
them
domini
saw
great
sloping
lawns
dotted
with
streets
and
by
trees
scents
of
hidden
flowers
came
to
her
in
the
night
and
she
heard
a
whirr
of
insects
still
they
mounted
and
presently
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
stop
said
androvsky
to
the
driver
he
drew
up
his
horses
wait
for
us
androvsky
got
out
shall
we
walk
a
little
way
he
said
to
domini
yes
she
got
out
too
and
they
walked
slowly
along
the
deserted
road
below
them
she
saw
the
lights
of
ships
gliding
upon
the
lakes
the
bright
eyes
of
a
lighthouse
the
distant
lamps
of
scattered
villages
along
the
shores
and
very
far
off
a
yellow
gleam
that
dominated
the
sea
beyond
the
lakes
and
seemed
to
watch
patiently
all
those
who
came
and
went
the
pilgrims
to
and
from
africa
that
gleam
shone
in
carthage
from
the
sea
over
the
flats
came
to
them
a
breeze
that
had
a
savour
of
freshness
of
cool
and
delicate
life
they
walked
for
some
time
without
speaking
then
domini
said
from
the
cemetery
of
you
looked
out
over
this
didn
t
you
boris
yes
domini
he
answered
it
was
then
that
the
voice
spoke
to
it
will
never
speak
again
god
will
not
let
it
speak
how
can
you
know
that
we
are
tried
in
the
fire
boris
but
we
are
not
burnt
to
she
said
it
for
herself
to
reassure
herself
to
give
a
little
comfort
to
her
own
soul
i
feel
as
if
it
were
not
so
he
answered
when
we
came
to
the
hotel
it
seemed
i
thought
that
i
could
not
go
and
now
now
i
do
not
know
anything
except
that
this
is
my
last
night
with
you
and
domini
that
seems
to
me
to
be
absolutely
incredible
although
i
know
it
i
can
not
imagine
any
future
away
from
you
any
life
in
which
i
do
not
see
you
i
feel
as
if
in
parting
from
you
i
am
parting
from
myself
as
if
the
thing
left
would
be
no
more
a
man
but
only
a
broken
husk
can
i
pray
without
you
love
god
without
you
best
without
but
can
i
live
without
you
domini
can
i
wake
day
after
day
to
the
sunshine
and
know
that
i
shall
never
see
you
again
and
go
on
living
can
i
do
that
i
don
t
feel
as
if
it
could
be
perhaps
when
i
have
done
my
penance
god
will
have
how
boris
perhaps
he
will
let
me
let
us
fix
all
the
thoughts
of
our
hearts
on
the
life
in
which
he
may
let
us
be
together
once
more
look
boris
there
are
lights
in
the
darkness
there
will
always
be
i
can
t
see
them
he
said
she
looked
at
him
and
saw
that
tears
were
running
down
his
cheeks
again
on
this
last
night
of
companionship
god
summoned
her
to
be
strong
for
him
on
the
edge
of
the
hill
close
to
them
she
saw
a
moorish
temple
built
of
marble
with
narrow
arches
and
columns
and
marble
seats
let
us
sit
here
for
a
moment
boris
she
said
he
followed
her
up
the
marble
steps
two
or
three
times
he
stumbled
but
she
did
not
give
him
her
hand
they
sat
down
between
the
slender
columns
and
looked
out
over
the
city
whose
blanched
domes
and
minarets
were
faintly
visible
in
the
night
androvsky
was
shaken
with
sobs
how
can
i
part
from
you
he
said
brokenly
how
am
i
to
do
it
how
can
i
how
can
i
why
was
i
given
this
love
for
you
this
terrible
thing
this
crying
out
this
reaching
out
of
the
flesh
and
heart
and
soul
to
you
domini
domini
what
does
it
all
mean
this
mystery
of
torture
this
scourging
of
the
body
this
tearing
in
pieces
of
my
soul
and
yours
domini
shall
we
know
shall
we
ever
know
i
am
sure
we
shall
know
we
shall
all
know
some
day
the
meaning
of
the
mystery
of
pain
and
then
perhaps
then
surely
we
shall
each
of
us
be
glad
that
we
have
suffered
the
suffering
will
make
the
glory
of
our
happiness
even
now
sometimes
when
i
am
suffering
boris
i
feel
as
if
there
were
a
kind
of
splendour
even
a
kind
of
nobility
in
what
i
am
doing
as
if
i
were
proving
my
own
soul
proving
the
force
that
god
has
put
into
me
boris
let
us
you
and
i
learn
to
say
in
all
this
terror
i
am
unconquered
i
am
i
feel
that
i
could
say
that
be
it
in
the
most
frightful
circumstances
if
only
i
could
sometimes
see
you
even
far
away
as
now
i
see
those
you
will
see
me
in
your
prayers
every
day
and
i
shall
see
you
in
but
the
cry
of
the
body
domini
of
the
eyes
of
the
hands
to
see
to
touch
it
s
so
fierce
it
s
so
it
s
so
i
know
i
hear
it
too
always
but
there
is
another
voice
which
will
be
strong
when
the
other
has
faded
into
eternal
silence
in
all
bodily
things
even
the
most
beautiful
there
is
something
finite
we
must
reach
out
our
poor
feeble
trembling
hands
to
the
infinite
i
think
everyone
who
is
born
does
that
through
life
often
without
being
conscious
of
it
we
shall
do
it
consciously
you
and
i
we
shall
be
able
to
do
it
because
of
our
dreadful
suffering
we
shall
want
we
shall
have
to
do
it
you
where
you
are
going
and
i
where
will
you
be
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
i
won
t
think
of
the
afterwards
now
in
these
last
few
hours
in
these
last
her
voice
faltered
and
broke
then
the
tears
came
to
her
also
and
for
a
while
she
could
not
see
the
distant
lights
then
she
spoke
again
she
said
boris
let
us
go
he
got
up
without
a
word
they
found
the
carriage
and
drove
back
to
tunis
when
they
reached
the
hotel
they
came
into
the
midst
of
the
american
tourists
who
were
excitedly
discussing
the
dances
they
had
seen
and
calling
for
cooling
drinks
to
allay
the
thirst
created
by
the
heat
of
the
close
rooms
of
oriental
houses
early
next
morning
a
carriage
was
at
the
door
when
they
had
got
into
it
the
coachman
looked
round
where
shall
i
drive
to
monsieur
androvsky
looked
at
him
and
made
no
reply
to
domini
said
to
the
monastery
madame
he
whistled
to
his
horses
gaily
as
they
trotted
on
bells
chimed
about
their
necks
chimed
a
merry
peal
to
the
sunshine
that
lay
over
the
land
they
passed
soldiers
marching
and
heard
the
call
of
bugles
the
rattle
of
drums
and
each
sound
seemed
distant
and
each
moving
figure
far
away
this
world
of
africa
fiercely
distinct
in
the
clear
air
under
the
cloudless
sky
was
unreal
to
them
both
was
vague
as
a
northern
land
wrapped
in
a
mist
of
autumn
the
unreal
was
about
them
within
themselves
was
the
real
they
sat
beside
each
other
without
speaking
words
to
them
now
were
useless
things
what
more
had
they
to
say
everything
and
nothing
lifetimes
would
not
have
been
long
enough
for
them
to
speak
their
thoughts
for
each
other
of
each
other
to
speak
their
emotions
all
that
was
in
their
minds
and
hearts
during
that
drive
from
the
city
to
the
monastery
that
stood
upon
the
hill
yet
did
not
their
mutual
action
of
that
morning
say
all
that
need
be
said
the
silence
of
the
trappists
surely
floated
out
to
them
over
the
plains
and
the
pale
waters
of
the
bitter
lakes
and
held
them
silent
but
the
bells
on
the
horses
necks
rang
always
gaily
and
the
coachman
who
would
presently
drive
domini
back
alone
to
tunis
whistled
and
sang
on
his
high
seat
presently
they
came
to
a
great
wooden
cross
standing
on
a
pedestal
of
stone
by
the
roadside
at
the
edge
of
a
grove
of
olive
trees
it
marked
the
beginning
of
the
domain
of
when
domini
saw
it
she
looked
at
androvsky
and
his
eyes
answered
her
silent
question
the
coachman
whipped
his
horses
into
a
canter
as
if
he
were
in
haste
to
reach
his
destination
he
was
thinking
of
the
good
red
wine
of
the
monks
in
a
cloud
of
white
dust
the
carriage
rolled
onwards
between
vineyards
in
which
here
and
there
labourers
were
working
sheltered
from
the
sun
by
immense
straw
hats
a
long
line
of
waggons
laden
with
barrels
and
drawn
by
mules
covered
with
bells
sheltered
from
the
flies
by
leaves
met
them
in
the
distance
domini
saw
forests
of
eucalyptus
trees
suddenly
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
saw
androvsky
coming
from
them
towards
the
white
road
helping
a
man
who
was
pale
and
who
stumbled
as
if
yet
whose
face
was
full
of
a
fierce
passion
of
joy
the
stranger
whose
influence
had
driven
him
out
of
the
monastery
into
the
world
she
bent
down
her
head
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
praying
praying
with
all
her
strength
for
courage
in
this
supreme
moment
of
her
life
but
almost
directly
the
prayers
died
on
her
lips
and
in
her
heart
and
she
found
herself
repeating
the
words
of
love
watcheth
and
sleeping
slumbereth
not
when
weary
it
is
not
tired
when
straitened
it
is
not
constrained
when
frightened
it
is
not
disturbed
but
like
a
vivid
flame
and
a
burning
torch
it
mounteth
upwards
and
securely
passeth
through
all
whosoever
loveth
knoweth
the
cry
of
this
again
and
again
she
said
the
words
it
securely
passeth
through
all
it
securely
passeth
through
now
at
last
she
was
to
know
the
uttermost
truth
of
those
words
which
she
had
loved
in
her
happiness
which
she
clung
to
now
as
a
little
child
clings
to
its
father
s
hand
the
carriage
turned
to
the
right
went
on
a
little
way
then
stopped
domini
lifted
her
face
from
her
hands
she
saw
before
her
a
great
door
which
stood
open
above
it
was
a
statue
of
the
madonna
and
child
and
on
either
side
were
two
angels
with
swords
and
stars
underneath
was
written
in
great
letters
janua
coeli
beyond
through
the
doorway
she
saw
an
open
space
upon
which
the
sunlight
streamed
three
palm
trees
and
a
second
door
which
was
shut
above
this
second
door
was
written
dames
n
entrent
pas
as
she
looked
the
figure
of
a
very
old
monk
with
a
long
white
beard
shuffled
slowly
across
the
patch
of
sunlight
and
disappeared
the
coachman
turned
round
you
descend
here
he
said
in
a
cheerful
voice
madame
will
be
entertained
in
the
parlour
on
the
right
of
the
first
door
but
monsieur
can
go
on
to
the
it
s
over
he
pointed
with
his
whip
and
turned
his
back
to
them
again
domini
sat
quite
still
her
lips
moved
once
more
repeating
the
words
of
androvsky
got
up
from
his
seat
stepped
heavily
out
of
the
carriage
and
stood
beside
it
the
coachman
was
busy
lighting
a
long
cigar
androvsky
leaned
forward
towards
domini
with
his
arms
on
the
carriage
and
looked
at
her
with
tearless
eyes
domini
at
last
he
whispered
domini
then
she
turned
to
him
bent
towards
him
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
looked
into
his
face
for
a
long
time
as
if
she
were
trying
to
see
it
now
for
all
the
years
that
were
perhaps
to
come
her
eyes
too
were
tearless
at
last
she
leaned
down
and
touched
his
forehead
with
her
lips
she
said
nothing
her
hands
dropped
from
his
shoulders
she
turned
away
and
her
lips
moved
once
more
then
androvsky
moved
slowly
in
through
the
doorway
of
the
monastery
crossed
the
patch
of
sunlight
lifted
his
hand
and
rang
the
bell
at
the
second
door
drive
back
to
tunis
madame
said
the
coachman
drive
back
to
madame
is
not
going
to
enter
but
monsieur
drive
back
to
tunis
something
in
the
voice
that
spoke
to
him
startled
the
coachman
he
hesitated
a
moment
staring
at
domini
from
his
seat
then
with
a
muttered
curse
he
turned
his
horses
heads
and
plied
the
whip
ferociously
love
watcheth
and
sleeping
slumbereth
not
when
weary
it
is
not
tired
when
weary
it
is
not
domini
s
lips
ceased
to
move
she
could
not
speak
any
more
she
could
not
even
pray
without
words
yet
in
that
moment
she
did
not
feel
alone
chapter
xxxi
in
the
garden
of
count
anteoni
which
has
now
passed
into
other
hands
a
little
boy
may
often
be
seen
playing
he
is
gay
as
children
are
and
sometimes
he
is
naughty
and
as
if
out
of
sheer
wantonness
he
destroys
the
pyramids
of
sand
erected
by
the
arab
gardeners
upon
the
narrow
paths
between
the
hills
or
tears
off
the
petals
of
the
geraniums
and
scatters
them
to
the
breezes
that
whisper
among
the
trees
but
when
larbi
s
flute
calls
to
him
he
runs
to
hear
he
sits
at
the
feet
of
that
persistent
lover
and
watches
the
big
fingers
fluttering
at
the
holes
of
the
reed
and
his
small
face
becomes
earnest
and
dreamy
as
if
it
looked
on
things
or
watched
the
pale
pageant
of
the
mirages
rising
mysteriously
out
of
the
sunlit
spaces
of
the
sands
to
fade
again
leaving
no
trace
behind
only
one
other
song
he
loves
more
than
the
twittering
tune
of
larbi
sometimes
when
twilight
is
falling
over
the
sahara
his
mother
calls
him
to
her
to
the
white
wall
where
she
is
sitting
beneath
a
jamelon
tree

she
whispers
the
little
boy
climbs
up
on
her
knee
leans
his
face
against
her
breast
and
obeys

passing
below
on
the

track
singing
to
himself
as
he
goes
towards
his
home
in
the
oasis
no
one
but
god
and
i
knows
what
is
in
my
he
is
singing
the
song
of
the
freed
negroes
when
his
voice
has
died
away

mother
puts
the

boy
down
it

time
and
smain
is
there
to
lead
him
to
the

villa
where
he
will
sleep
dreamlessly
till
morning
but
the
mother
stays
alone
by
the
wall
till
the
night
falls
and
the
desert
is
hidden
no

she
whispers
the
words
to
herself
the
cool
wind
of
the
night
blows
over
the
vast
spaces
of
the
sahara
and
touches
her
cheek
reminding
her
of
the
wind
that
at
arba
carried
fire
towards
her
as
she
sat
before
the
tent
reminding
her
of
her
glorious
days
of
liberty
of
the
passion
that
came
to
her
soul
like
fire
in
the
desert
but
she
does
not
rebel
for
always
when
night
falls
she
sees
the
form
of
a
man
praying
who
once
fled
from
prayer
in
the
desert
she
sees
a
wanderer
who
at
last
has
reached
his
home
