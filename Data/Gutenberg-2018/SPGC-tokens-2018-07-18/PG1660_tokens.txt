allow
me
to
place
your
name
at
the
beginning
of
an
essentially
parisian
work
thought
out
in
your
house
during
these
latter
days
is
it
not
natural
that
i
should
offer
you
the
flowers
of
rhetoric
that
blossomed
in
your
garden
watered
with
the
regrets
i
suffered
from
which
you
soothed
as
i
wandered
under
the
boschetti
whose
elms
reminded
me
of
the
thus
perchance
may
i
expiate
the
crime
of
having
dreamed
of
paris
under
the
shadow
of
the
duomo
of
having
longed
for
our
muddy
streets
on
the
clean
and
elegant
flagstones
of
when
i
have
some
book
to
publish
which
may
be
dedicated
to
a
milanese
lady
i
shall
have
the
happiness
of
finding
names
already
dear
to
your
old
italian
romancers
among
those
of
women
whom
we
love
and
to
whose
memory
i
would
beg
you
to
recall
your
sincerely
affectionate
de
balzac
july
scenes
from
a
courtesan
s
life
esther
happy
or
how
a
courtesan
can
love
in
at
the
last
opera
ball
of
the
season
several
masks
were
struck
by
the
beauty
of
a
youth
who
was
wandering
about
the
passages
and
greenroom
with
the
air
of
a
man
in
search
of
a
woman
kept
at
home
by
unexpected
circumstances
the
secret
of
this
behavior
now
dilatory
and
again
hurried
is
known
only
to
old
women
and
to
certain
experienced
loungers
in
this
immense
assembly
the
crowd
does
not
trouble
itself
much
to
watch
the
crowd
each
one
s
interest
is
impassioned
and
even
idlers
are
preoccupied
the
young
dandy
was
so
much
absorbed
in
his
anxious
quest
that
he
did
not
observe
his
own
success
he
did
not
hear
he
did
not
see
the
ironical
exclamations
of
admiration
the
genuine
appreciation
the
biting
gibes
the
soft
invitations
of
some
of
the
masks
though
he
was
so
handsome
as
to
rank
among
those
exceptional
persons
who
come
to
an
opera
ball
in
search
of
an
adventure
and
who
expect
it
as
confidently
as
men
looked
for
a
lucky
coup
at
roulette
in
frascati
s
day
he
seemed
quite
philosophically
sure
of
his
evening
he
must
be
the
hero
of
one
of
those
mysteries
with
three
actors
which
constitute
an
opera
ball
and
are
known
only
to
those
who
play
a
part
in
them
for
to
young
wives
who
come
merely
to
say
i
have
seen
it
to
country
people
to
inexperienced
youths
and
to
foreigners
the
opera
house
must
on
those
nights
be
the
palace
of
fatigue
and
dulness
to
these
that
black
swarm
slow
and
serried
coming
going
winding
turning
returning
mounting
descending
comparable
only
to
ants
on
a
pile
of
wood
is
no
more
intelligible
than
the
bourse
to
a
breton
peasant
who
has
never
heard
of
the
grand
livre
with
a
few
rare
exceptions
men
wear
no
masks
in
paris
a
man
in
a
domino
is
thought
ridiculous
in
this
the
spirit
of
the
nation
betrays
itself
men
who
want
to
hide
their
good
fortune
can
enjoy
the
opera
ball
without
going
there
and
masks
who
are
absolutely
compelled
to
go
in
come
out
again
at
once
one
of
the
most
amusing
scenes
is
the
crush
at
the
doors
produced
as
soon
as
the
dancing
begins
by
the
rush
of
persons
getting
away
and
struggling
with
those
who
are
pushing
in
so
the
men
who
wear
masks
are
either
jealous
husbands
who
come
to
watch
their
wives
or
husbands
on
the
loose
who
do
not
wish
to
be
watched
by
them
two
situations
equally
ridiculous
now
our
young
man
was
followed
though
he
knew
it
not
by
a
man
in
a
mask
dogging
his
steps
short
and
stout
with
a
rolling
gait
like
a
barrel
to
every
one
familiar
with
the
opera
this
disguise
betrayed
a
a
banker
a
lawyer
some
citizen
soul
suspicious
of
infidelity
for
in
fact
in
really
high
society
no
one
courts
such
humiliating
proofs
several
masks
had
laughed
as
they
pointed
this
preposterous
figure
out
to
each
other
some
had
spoken
to
him
a
few
young
men
had
made
game
of
him
but
his
stolid
manner
showed
entire
contempt
for
these
aimless
shafts
he
went
on
whither
the
young
man
led
him
as
a
hunted
wild
boar
goes
on
and
pays
no
heed
to
the
bullets
whistling
about
his
ears
or
the
dogs
barking
at
his
heels
though
at
first
sight
pleasure
and
anxiety
wear
the
same
livery
the
noble
black
robe
of
venice
and
though
all
is
confusion
at
an
opera
ball
the
various
circles
composing
parisian
society
meet
there
recognize
and
watch
each
other
there
are
certain
ideas
so
clear
to
the
initiated
that
this
scrawled
medley
of
interests
is
as
legible
to
them
as
any
amusing
novel
so
to
these
old
hands
this
man
could
not
be
here
by
appointment
he
would
infallibly
have
worn
some
token
red
white
or
green
such
as
notifies
a
happy
meeting
previously
agreed
on
was
it
a
case
of
revenge
seeing
the
domino
following
so
closely
in
the
wake
of
a
man
apparently
happy
in
an
assignation
some
of
the
gazers
looked
again
at
the
handsome
face
on
which
anticipation
had
set
its
divine
halo
the
youth
was
interesting
the
longer
he
wandered
the
more
curiosity
he
excited
everything
about
him
proclaimed
the
habits
of
refined
life
in
obedience
to
a
fatal
law
of
the
time
we
live
in
there
is
not
much
difference
physical
or
moral
between
the
most
elegant
and
best
bred
son
of
a
duke
and
peer
and
this
attractive
youth
whom
poverty
had
not
long
since
held
in
its
iron
grip
in
the
heart
of
paris
beauty
and
youth
might
cover
him
in
deep
gulfs
as
in
many
a
young
man
who
longs
to
play
a
part
in
paris
without
having
the
capital
to
support
his
pretensions
and
who
day
after
day
risks
all
to
win
all
by
sacrificing
to
the
god
who
has
most
votaries
in
this
royal
city
namely
chance
at
the
same
time
his
dress
and
manners
were
above
reproach
he
trod
the
classic
floor
of
the
opera
house
as
one
accustomed
there
who
can
have
failed
to
observe
that
there
as
in
every
zone
in
paris
there
is
a
manner
of
being
which
shows
who
you
are
what
you
are
doing
whence
you
come
and
what
you
want
what
a
handsome
young
fellow
and
here
we
may
turn
round
to
look
at
him
said
a
mask
in
whom
accustomed
eyes
recognized
a
lady
of
position
do
you
not
remember
him
replied
the
man
on
whose
arm
she
was
leaning
madame
du
chatelet
introduced
him
to
you
what
is
that
the
apothecary
s
son
she
fancied
herself
in
love
with
who
became
a
journalist
mademoiselle
coralie
s
lover
i
fancied
he
had
fallen
too
low
ever
to
pull
himself
up
again
and
i
can
not
understand
how
he
can
show
himself
again
in
the
world
of
paris
said
the
comte
sixte
du
chatelet
he
has
the
air
of
a
prince
the
mask
went
on
and
it
is
not
the
actress
he
lived
with
who
could
give
it
to
him
my
cousin
who
understood
him
could
not
lick
him
into
shape
i
should
like
to
know
the
mistress
of
this
sargine
tell
me
something
about
him
that
will
enable
me
to
mystify
this
couple
whispering
as
they
watched
the
young
man
became
the
object
of
study
to
the
domino
dear
monsieur
chardon
said
the
prefet
of
the
charente
taking
the
dandy
s
hand
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
some
one
who
wishes
to
renew
acquaintance
with
you
dear
comte
chatelet
replied
the
young
man
that
lady
taught
me
how
ridiculous
was
the
name
by
which
you
address
me
a
patent
from
the
king
has
restored
to
me
that
of
my
mother
s
family
the
rubempres
although
the
fact
has
been
announced
in
the
papers
it
relates
to
so
unimportant
a
person
that
i
need
not
blush
to
recall
it
to
my
friends
my
enemies
and
those
who
are
neither
you
may
class
yourself
where
you
will
but
i
am
sure
you
will
not
disapprove
of
a
step
to
which
i
was
advised
by
your
wife
when
she
was
still
only
madame
de
this
neat
retort
which
made
the
marquise
smile
gave
the
prefet
of
la
charente
a
nervous
chill
you
may
tell
her
lucien
went
on
that
i
now
bear
gules
a
bull
raging
argent
on
a
meadow
raging
argent
echoed
chatelet
madame
la
marquise
will
explain
to
you
if
you
do
not
know
why
that
old
coat
is
a
little
better
than
the
chamberlain
s
key
and
imperial
gold
bees
which
you
bear
on
yours
to
the
great
despair
of
madame
chatelet
nee
negrepelisse
d
espard
said
lucien
quickly
since
you
recognize
me
i
can
not
puzzle
you
and
i
could
never
tell
you
how
much
you
puzzle
me
said
the
marquise
d
espard
amazed
at
the
coolness
and
impertinence
to
which
the
man
had
risen
whom
she
had
formerly
despised
then
allow
me
madame
to
preserve
my
only
chance
of
occupying
your
thoughts
by
remaining
in
that
mysterious
twilight
said
he
with
the
smile
of
a
man
who
does
not
wish
to
risk
assured
happiness
i
congratulate
you
on
your
changed
fortunes
said
the
comte
du
chatelet
to
lucien
i
take
it
as
you
offer
it
replied
lucien
bowing
with
much
grace
to
the
marquise
what
a
coxcomb
said
the
count
in
an
undertone
to
madame
d
espard
he
has
succeeded
in
winning
an
with
these
young
men
such
coxcombry
when
it
is
addressed
to
us
almost
always
implies
some
success
in
high
places
said
the
lady
for
with
you
older
men
it
means
and
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
which
of
my
grand
lady
friends
has
taken
this
fine
bird
under
her
patronage
then
i
might
find
the
means
of
amusing
myself
this
evening
my
ticket
anonymously
sent
is
no
doubt
a
bit
of
mischief
planned
by
a
rival
and
having
something
to
do
with
this
young
man
his
impertinence
is
to
order
keep
an
eye
on
him
i
will
take
the
duc
de
navarrein
s
arm
you
will
be
able
to
find
me
just
as
madame
d
espard
was
about
to
address
her
cousin
the
mysterious
mask
came
between
her
and
the
duke
to
whisper
in
her
ear
lucien
loves
you
he
wrote
the
note
your
prefet
is
his
greatest
foe
how
can
he
speak
in
his
presence
the
stranger
moved
off
leaving
madame
d
espard
a
prey
to
a
double
surprise
the
marquise
knew
no
one
in
the
world
who
was
capable
of
playing
the
part
assumed
by
this
mask
she
suspected
a
snare
and
went
to
sit
down
out
of
sight
the
comte
sixte
du
chatelet
whom
lucien
had
abridged
of
his
ambitious
with
an
emphasis
that
betrayed
long
meditated
revenge
followed
the
handsome
dandy
and
presently
met
a
young
man
to
whom
he
thought
he
could
speak
without
reserve
well
rastignac
have
you
seen
lucien
he
has
come
out
in
a
new
if
i
were
half
as
good
looking
as
he
is
i
should
be
twice
as
rich
replied
the
fine
gentleman
in
a
light
but
meaning
tone
expressive
of
keen
raillery
no
said
the
fat
mask
in
his
ear
repaying
a
thousand
ironies
in
one
by
the
accent
he
lent
the
monosyllable
rastignac
who
was
not
the
man
to
swallow
an
affront
stood
as
if
struck
by
lightning
and
allowed
himself
to
be
led
into
a
recess
by
a
grasp
of
iron
which
he
could
not
shake
off
you
young
cockerel
hatched
in
mother
vauquer
s
coop
you
whose
heart
failed
you
to
clutch
old
taillefer
s
millions
when
the
hardest
part
of
the
business
was
done
let
me
tell
you
for
your
personal
safety
that
if
you
do
not
treat
lucien
like
the
brother
you
love
you
are
in
our
power
while
we
are
not
in
yours
silence
and
submission
or
i
shall
join
your
game
and
upset
the
skittles
lucien
de
rubempre
is
under
the
protection
of
the
strongest
power
of
the
day
the
church
choose
between
life
and
death
rastignac
felt
giddy
like
a
man
who
has
slept
in
a
forest
and
wakes
to
see
by
his
side
a
famishing
lioness
he
was
frightened
and
there
was
no
one
to
see
him
the
boldest
men
yield
to
fear
under
such
circumstances
no
one
but
he
can
know
or
would
dare
he
murmured
to
himself
the
mask
clutched
his
hand
tighter
to
prevent
his
finishing
his
sentence
act
as
if
i
were
he
said
rastignac
then
acted
like
a
millionaire
on
the
highroad
with
a
brigand
s
pistol
at
his
head
he
surrendered
my
dear
count
said
he
to
du
chatelet
to
whom
he
presently
returned
if
you
care
for
your
position
in
life
treat
lucien
de
rubempre
as
a
man
whom
you
will
one
day
see
holding
a
place
far
above
where
you
the
mask
made
a
imperceptible
gesture
of
approbation
and
went
off
in
search
of
lucien
my
dear
fellow
you
have
changed
your
opinion
of
him
very
suddenly
replied
the
prefet
with
justifiable
surprise
as
suddenly
as
men
change
who
belong
to
the
centre
and
vote
with
the
right
replied
rastignac
to
the
whose
vote
had
for
a
few
days
failed
to
support
the
ministry
are
there
such
things
as
opinions
nowadays
there
are
only
interests
observed
des
lupeaulx
who
had
heard
them
what
is
the
case
in
point
the
case
of
the
sieur
de
rubempre
whom
rastignac
is
setting
up
as
a
person
of
consequence
said
du
chatelet
to
the
my
dear
count
replied
des
lupeaulx
very
seriously
monsieur
de
rubempre
is
a
young
man
of
the
highest
merit
and
has
such
good
interest
at
his
back
that
i
should
be
delighted
to
renew
my
acquaintance
with
there
he
is
rushing
into
the
wasps
nest
of
the
rakes
of
the
day
said
rastignac
the
three
speakers
looked
towards
a
corner
where
a
group
of
recognized
wits
had
gathered
men
of
more
or
less
celebrity
and
several
men
of
fashion
these
gentlemen
made
common
stock
of
their
jests
their
remarks
and
their
scandal
trying
to
amuse
themselves
till
something
should
amuse
them
among
this
strangely
mingled
party
were
some
men
with
whom
lucien
had
had
transactions
combining
ostensibly
kind
offices
with
covert
false
dealing
hallo
lucien
my
boy
why
here
we
are
patched
up
again
new
stuffing
and
a
new
cover
where
have
we
come
from
have
we
mounted
the
high
horse
once
more
with
little
offerings
from
florine
s
boudoir
bravo
old
chap
and
blondet
released
finot
to
put
his
arm
affectionately
around
lucien
and
press
him
to
his
heart
andoche
finot
was
the
proprietor
of
a
review
on
which
lucien
had
worked
for
almost
nothing
and
to
which
blondet
gave
the
benefit
of
his
collaboration
of
the
wisdom
of
his
suggestions
and
the
depth
of
his
views
finot
and
blondet
embodied
bertrand
and
raton
with
this
difference
that
la
fontaine
s
cat
at
last
showed
that
he
knew
himself
to
be
duped
while
blondet
though
he
knew
that
he
was
being
fleeced
still
did
all
he
could
for
finot
this
brilliant
condottiere
of
the
pen
was
in
fact
long
to
remain
a
slave
finot
hid
a
brutal
strength
of
will
under
a
heavy
exterior
under
polish
of
wit
as
a
laborer
rubs
his
bread
with
garlic
he
knew
how
to
garner
what
he
gleaned
ideas
and
alike
in
the
fields
of
the
dissolute
life
led
by
men
engaged
in
letters
or
in
politics
blondet
for
his
sins
had
placed
his
powers
at
the
service
of
finot
s
vices
and
idleness
always
at
war
with
necessity
he
was
one
of
the
race
of
and
superior
men
who
can
do
everything
for
the
fortune
of
others
and
nothing
for
their
own
aladdins
who
let
other
men
borrow
their
lamp
these
excellent
advisers
have
a
clear
and
penetrating
judgment
so
long
as
it
is
not
distracted
by
personal
interest
in
them
it
is
the
head
and
not
the
arm
that
acts
hence
the
looseness
of
their
morality
and
hence
the
reproach
heaped
upon
them
by
inferior
minds
blondet
would
share
his
purse
with
a
comrade
he
had
affronted
the
day
before
he
would
dine
drink
and
sleep
with
one
whom
he
would
demolish
on
the
morrow
his
amusing
paradoxes
excused
everything
accepting
the
whole
world
as
a
jest
he
did
not
want
to
be
taken
seriously
young
beloved
almost
famous
and
contented
he
did
not
devote
himself
like
finot
to
acquiring
the
fortune
an
old
man
needs
the
most
difficult
form
of
courage
perhaps
is
that
which
lucien
needed
at
this
moment
to
get
rid
of
blondet
as
he
had
just
got
rid
of
madame
d
espard
and
chatelet
in
him
unfortunately
the
joys
of
vanity
hindered
the
exercise
of
pride
the
basis
beyond
doubt
of
many
great
things
his
vanity
had
triumphed
in
the
previous
encounter
he
had
shown
himself
as
a
rich
man
happy
and
scornful
to
two
persons
who
had
scorned
him
when
he
was
poor
and
wretched
but
how
could
a
poet
like
an
old
diplomate
run
the
gauntlet
with
two
friends
who
had
welcomed
him
in
misery
under
whose
roof
he
had
slept
in
the
worst
of
his
troubles
finot
blondet
and
he
had
groveled
together
they
had
wallowed
in
such
orgies
as
consume
something
more
than
money
like
soldiers
who
find
no
market
for
their
courage
lucien
had
just
done
what
many
men
do
in
paris
he
had
still
further
compromised
his
character
by
shaking
finot
s
hand
and
not
rejecting
blondet
s
affection
every
man
who
has
dabbled
or
still
dabbles
in
journalism
is
under
the
painful
necessity
of
bowing
to
men
he
despises
of
smiling
at
his
dearest
foe
of
compounding
the
foulest
meanness
of
soiling
his
fingers
to
pay
his
aggressors
in
their
own
coin
he
becomes
used
to
seeing
evil
done
and
passing
it
over
he
begins
by
condoning
it
and
ends
by
committing
it
in
the
long
run
the
soul
constantly
strained
by
shameful
and
perpetual
compromise
sinks
lower
the
spring
of
noble
thoughts
grows
rusty
the
hinges
of
familiarity
wear
easy
and
turn
of
their
own
accord
alceste
becomes
philinte
natures
lose
their
firmness
talents
are
perverted
faith
in
great
deeds
evaporates
the
man
who
yearned
to
be
proud
of
his
work
wastes
himself
in
rubbishy
articles
which
his
conscience
regards
sooner
or
later
as
so
many
evil
actions
he
started
like
lousteau
or
vernou
to
be
a
great
writer
he
finds
himself
a
feeble
scrivener
hence
it
is
impossible
to
honor
too
highly
men
whose
character
stands
as
high
as
their
talent
men
like
d
arthez
who
know
how
to
walk
surefooted
across
the
reefs
of
literary
life
lucien
could
make
no
reply
to
blondet
s
flattery
his
wit
had
an
irresistible
charm
for
him
and
he
maintained
the
hold
of
the
corrupter
over
his
pupil
besides
he
held
a
position
in
the
world
through
his
connection
with
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
has
an
uncle
left
you
a
fortune
said
finot
laughing
at
him
like
you
i
have
marked
some
fools
for
cutting
down
replied
lucien
in
the
same
tone
then
monsieur
has
a
review
a
newspaper
of
his
own
andoche
finot
retorted
with
the
impertinent
presumption
of
a
chief
to
a
subordinate
i
have
something
better
replied
lucien
whose
vanity
nettled
by
the
assumed
superiority
of
his
editor
restored
him
to
the
sense
of
his
new
position
what
is
that
my
dear
boy
i
have
a
there
is
a
lucien
party
said
vernou
smiling
finot
the
boy
has
left
you
in
the
lurch
i
told
you
he
would
lucien
is
a
clever
fellow
and
you
never
were
respectful
to
him
you
used
him
as
a
hack
repent
blockhead
said
blondet
blondet
as
sharp
as
a
needle
could
detect
more
than
one
secret
in
lucien
s
air
and
manner
while
stroking
him
down
he
contrived
to
tighten
the
curb
he
meant
to
know
the
reasons
of
lucien
s
return
to
paris
his
projects
and
his
means
of
living
on
your
knees
to
a
superiority
you
can
never
attain
to
albeit
you
are
finot
he
went
on
admit
this
gentleman
forthwith
to
be
one
of
the
great
men
to
whom
the
future
belongs
he
is
one
of
us
so
witty
and
so
handsome
can
he
fail
to
succeed
by
your
quibuscumque
viis
here
he
stands
in
his
good
milan
armor
his
strong
sword
half
unsheathed
and
his
pennon
flying
bless
me
lucien
where
did
you
steal
that
smart
waistcoat
love
alone
can
find
such
stuff
as
that
have
you
an
address
at
this
moment
i
am
anxious
to
know
where
my
friends
are
domiciled
i
don
t
know
where
to
sleep
finot
has
turned
me
out
of
doors
for
the
night
under
the
vulgar
pretext
of
a
lady
in
the
my
boy
said
lucien
i
put
into
practice
a
motto
by
which
you
may
secure
a
quiet
life
fuge
late
tace
i
am
but
i
am
not
off
till
you
pay
me
a
sacred
debt
that
little
supper
you
know
heh
said
blondet
who
was
rather
too
much
given
to
good
cheer
and
got
himself
treated
when
he
was
out
of
funds
what
supper
asked
lucien
with
a
little
stamp
of
impatience
you
don
t
remember
in
that
i
recognize
my
prosperous
friend
he
has
lost
his
he
knows
what
he
owes
us
i
will
go
bail
for
his
good
heart
said
finot
taking
up
blondet
s
joke
rastignac
said
blondet
taking
the
young
dandy
by
the
arm
as
he
came
up
the
room
to
the
column
where
the
friends
were
standing
there
is
a
supper
in
the
wind
you
will
join
us
unless
he
added
gravely
turning
to
lucien
monsieur
persists
in
ignoring
a
debt
of
honor
he
monsieur
de
rubempre
is
incapable
of
such
a
thing
i
will
answer
for
him
said
rastignac
who
never
dreamed
of
a
practical
joke
and
there
is
bixiou
he
will
come
too
cried
blondet
there
is
no
fun
without
him
without
him
champagne
cloys
my
tongue
and
i
find
everything
insipid
even
the
pepper
of
my
friends
said
bixiou
i
see
you
have
gathered
round
the
wonder
of
the
day
our
dear
lucien
has
revived
the
metamorphoses
of
ovid
just
as
the
gods
used
to
turn
into
strange
vegetables
and
other
things
to
seduce
the
ladies
he
has
turned
the
chardon
the
thistle
into
a
gentleman
to
bewitch
whom
charles
my
dear
boy
he
went
on
holding
lucien
by
his
coat
button
a
journalist
who
apes
the
fine
gentleman
deserves
rough
music
in
their
place
said
the
merciless
jester
as
he
pointed
to
finot
and
vernou
i
should
take
you
up
in
my
society
paper
you
would
bring
in
a
hundred
francs
for
ten
columns
of
bixiou
said
blondet
an
amphitryon
is
sacred
for
hours
before
a
feast
and
twelve
hours
after
our
illustrious
friend
is
giving
us
a
what
then
cried
bixiou
what
is
more
imperative
than
the
duty
of
saving
a
great
name
from
oblivion
of
endowing
the
indigent
aristocracy
with
a
man
of
talent
lucien
you
enjoy
the
esteem
of
the
press
of
which
you
were
a
distinguished
ornament
and
we
will
give
you
our
finot
a
paragraph
in
the
latest
items
blondet
a
little
butter
on
the
fourth
page
of
your
paper
we
must
advertise
the
appearance
of
one
of
the
finest
books
of
the
age
archer
de
charles
we
will
appeal
to
dauriat
to
bring
out
as
soon
as
possible
those
divine
sonnets
by
the
french
petrarch
we
must
carry
our
friend
through
on
the
shield
of
stamped
paper
by
which
reputations
are
made
and
if
you
want
a
supper
said
lucien
to
blondet
hoping
to
rid
himself
of
this
mob
which
threatened
to
increase
it
seems
to
me
that
you
need
not
work
up
hyperbole
and
parable
to
attack
an
old
friend
as
if
he
were
a
booby
night
at
lointier
s
he
cried
seeing
a
woman
come
by
whom
he
rushed
to
meet
oh
oh
oh
said
bixiou
on
three
notes
with
a
mocking
glance
and
seeming
to
recognize
the
mask
to
whom
lucien
addressed
himself
this
needs
he
followed
the
handsome
pair
got
past
them
examined
them
keenly
and
came
back
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
all
the
envious
crowd
who
were
eager
to
learn
the
source
of
lucien
s
change
of
fortune
friends
said
bixiou
you
have
long
known
the
goddess
of
the
sire
de
rubempre
s
fortune
she
is
des
lupeaulx
s
former
a
form
of
dissipation
now
forgotten
but
still
customary
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
was
the
keeping
of
the
rat
a
slang
word
that
has
become
was
a
girl
of
ten
or
twelve
in
the
chorus
of
some
theatre
more
particularly
at
the
opera
who
was
trained
by
young
roues
to
vice
and
infamy
a
rat
was
a
sort
of
demon
page
a
tomboy
who
was
forgiven
a
trick
if
it
were
but
funny
the
rat
might
take
what
she
pleased
she
was
to
be
watched
like
a
dangerous
animal
and
she
brought
an
element
of
liveliness
into
life
like
scapin
sganarelle
and
frontin
in
comedy
but
a
rat
was
too
expensive
it
made
no
return
in
honor
profit
or
pleasure
the
fashion
of
rats
so
completely
went
out
that
in
these
days
few
people
knew
anything
of
this
detail
of
fashionable
life
before
the
restoration
till
certain
writers
took
up
the
rat
as
a
new
subject
what
after
having
seen
coralie
killed
under
him
lucien
means
to
rob
us
of
la
torpille
the
torpedo
fish
said
blondet
as
he
heard
the
name
the
brawny
mask
gave
a
significant
start
which
though
repressed
was
understood
by
rastignac
it
is
out
of
the
question
replied
finot
la
torpille
has
not
a
sou
to
give
away
nathan
tells
me
she
borrowed
a
thousand
francs
of
come
gentlemen
gentlemen
said
rastignac
anxious
to
defend
lucien
against
so
odious
an
imputation
well
cried
vernou
is
coralie
s
kept
man
likely
to
be
so
very
particular
oh
replied
bixiou
those
thousand
francs
prove
to
me
that
our
friend
lucien
lives
with
la
torpille
what
an
irreparable
loss
to
literature
science
art
and
politics
exclaimed
blondet
la
torpille
is
the
only
common
prostitute
in
whom
i
ever
found
the
stuff
for
a
superior
courtesan
she
has
not
been
spoiled
by
education
she
can
neither
read
nor
write
she
would
have
understood
us
we
might
have
given
to
our
era
one
of
those
magnificent
aspasias
without
which
there
can
be
no
golden
age
see
how
admirably
madame
du
barry
was
suited
to
the
eighteenth
century
ninon
de
l
enclos
to
the
seventeenth
marion
delorme
to
the
sixteenth
imperia
to
the
fifteenth
flora
to
republican
rome
which
she
made
her
heir
and
which
paid
off
the
public
debt
with
her
fortune
what
would
horace
be
without
lydia
tibullus
without
delia
catullus
without
lesbia
propertius
without
cynthia
demetrius
without
lamia
who
is
his
glory
at
this
day
blondet
talking
of
demetrius
in
the
opera
house
seems
to
me
rather
too
strong
of
the
said
bixiou
in
his
neighbor
s
ears
and
where
would
the
empire
of
the
caesars
have
been
but
for
these
queens
blondet
went
on
lais
and
rhodope
are
greece
and
egypt
they
all
indeed
are
the
poetry
of
the
ages
in
which
they
lived
this
poetry
which
napoleon
lacked
for
the
widow
of
his
great
army
is
a
barrack
jest
was
not
wanting
to
the
revolution
it
had
madame
tallien
in
these
days
there
is
certainly
a
throne
to
let
in
france
which
is
for
her
who
can
fill
it
we
among
us
could
make
a
queen
i
should
have
given
la
torpille
an
aunt
for
her
mother
is
too
decidedly
dead
on
the
field
of
dishonor
du
tillet
would
have
given
her
a
mansion
lousteau
a
carriage
rastignac
her
footmen
des
lupeaulx
a
cook
finot
her
hats
finot
could
not
suppress
a
shrug
at
standing
the
fire
of
this
epigram
vernou
would
have
composed
her
advertisements
and
bixiou
her
repartees
the
aristocracy
would
have
come
to
enjoy
themselves
with
our
ninon
where
we
would
have
got
artists
together
under
pain
of
death
by
newspaper
articles
ninon
the
second
would
have
been
magnificently
impertinent
overwhelming
in
luxury
she
would
have
set
up
opinions
some
prohibited
dramatic
masterpiece
should
have
been
read
in
her
it
should
have
been
written
on
purpose
if
necessary
she
would
not
have
been
liberal
a
courtesan
is
essentially
monarchical
oh
what
a
loss
she
ought
to
have
embraced
her
whole
century
and
she
makes
love
with
a
little
young
man
lucien
will
make
a
sort
of
of
none
of
the
female
powers
of
whom
you
speak
ever
trudged
the
streets
said
finot
and
that
pretty
little
rat
has
rolled
in
the
like
a
in
the
soil
replied
vernou
and
she
has
improved
in
it
and
flowered
hence
her
superiority
must
we
not
have
known
everything
to
be
able
to
create
the
laughter
and
joy
which
are
part
of
everything
he
is
right
said
lousteau
who
had
hitherto
listened
without
speaking
la
torpille
can
laugh
and
make
others
laugh
that
gift
of
all
great
writers
and
great
actors
is
proper
to
those
who
have
investigated
every
social
deep
at
eighteen
that
girl
had
already
known
the
greatest
wealth
the
most
squalid
misery
men
of
every
degree
she
bears
about
her
a
sort
of
magic
wand
by
which
she
lets
loose
the
brutal
appetites
so
vehemently
suppressed
in
men
who
still
have
a
heart
while
occupied
with
politics
or
science
literature
or
art
there
is
not
in
paris
another
woman
who
can
say
to
the
beast
as
she
does
come
out
and
the
beast
leaves
his
lair
and
wallows
in
excesses
she
feeds
you
up
to
the
chin
she
helps
you
to
drink
and
smoke
in
short
this
woman
is
the
salt
of
which
rabelais
writes
which
thrown
on
matter
animates
it
and
elevates
it
to
the
marvelous
realms
of
art
her
robe
displays
unimagined
splendor
her
fingers
drop
gems
as
her
lips
shed
smiles
she
gives
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
to
every
little
thing
her
chatter
twinkles
with
bright
sayings
she
has
the
secret
of
the
quaintest
onomatopoeia
full
of
color
and
giving
color
she
you
are
wasting
five
francs
worth
of
copy
said
bixiou
interrupting
lousteau
la
torpille
is
something
far
better
than
all
that
you
have
all
been
in
love
with
her
more
or
less
not
one
of
you
can
say
that
she
ever
was
his
mistress
she
can
always
command
you
you
will
never
command
her
you
may
force
your
way
in
and
ask
her
to
do
you
a
service
oh
she
is
more
generous
than
a
brigand
chief
who
knows
his
business
and
more
devoted
than
the
best
of
said
blondet
you
may
trust
her
with
your
purse
or
your
secrets
but
what
made
me
choose
her
as
queen
is
her
indifference
for
a
fallen
she
like
her
mother
is
much
too
dear
said
des
lupeaulx
the
handsome
dutch
woman
would
have
swallowed
up
the
income
of
the
archbishop
of
toledo
she
ate
two
notaries
out
of
house
and
home
and
kept
maxime
de
trailles
when
he
was
a
court
page
said
bixiou
la
torpille
is
too
dear
as
raphael
was
or
careme
or
taglioni
or
lawrence
or
boule
or
any
artist
of
genius
is
too
dear
said
blondet

never
looked
so
thoroughly
a
lady
said
rastignac
pointing
to
the
masked
figure
to
whom
lucien
had
given
his
arm
i
will
bet
on
its
being
madame
de
not
a
doubt
of
it
cried
du
chatelet
and
monsieur
du
rubempre
s
fortune
is
accounted
ah
the
church
knows
how
to
choose
its
levites
what
a
sweet
ambassador
s
secretary
he
will
make
remarked
des
lupeaulx
all
the
more
so
rastignac
went
on
because
lucien
is
a
really
clever
fellow
these
gentlemen
have
had
proof
of
it
more
than
once
and
he
turned
to
blondet
finot
and
lousteau
yes
the
boy
is
cut
out
of
the
right
stuff
to
get
on
said
lousteau
who
was
dying
of
jealousy
and
particularly
because
he
has
what
we
call
independent
ideas
it
is
you
who
trained
him
said
vernou
well
replied
bixiou
looking
at
des
lupeaulx
i
trust
to
the
memory
of
monsieur
the
and
master
of
appeals
that
mask
is
la
torpille
and
i
will
stand
a
supper
on
i
will
hold
the
stakes
said
du
chatelet
curious
to
know
the
truth
come
des
lupeaulx
said
finot
try
to
identify
your
rat
s
there
is
no
need
for
committing
the
crime
of
treason
against
a
mask
replied
bixiou
la
torpille
and
lucien
must
pass
us
as
they
go
up
the
room
again
and
i
pledge
myself
to
prove
that
it
is
so
our
friend
lucien
has
come
above
water
once
more
said
nathan
joining
the
group
i
thought
he
had
gone
back
to
angoumois
for
the
rest
of
his
days
has
he
discovered
some
secret
to
ruin
the
english
he
has
done
what
you
will
not
do
in
a
hurry
retorted
rastignac
he
has
paid
the
burly
mask
nodded
in
confirmation
a
man
who
has
sown
his
wild
oats
at
his
age
puts
himself
out
of
court
he
has
no
pluck
he
puts
money
in
the
funds
replied
nathan
oh
that
youngster
will
always
be
a
fine
gentleman
and
will
always
have
such
lofty
notions
as
will
place
him
far
above
many
men
who
think
themselves
his
betters
replied
rastignac
at
this
moment
journalists
dandies
and
idlers
were
all
examining
the
charming
subject
of
their
bet
as
examine
a
horse
for
sale
these
connoisseurs
grown
old
in
familiarity
with
every
form
of
parisian
depravity
all
men
of
superior
talent
each
his
own
way
equally
corrupt
equally
corrupting
all
given
over
to
unbridled
ambition
accustomed
to
assume
and
to
guess
everything
had
their
eyes
centered
on
a
masked
woman
a
woman
whom
no
one
else
could
identify
they
and
certain
habitual
frequenters
of
the
opera
balls
could
alone
recognize
under
the
long
shroud
of
the
black
domino
the
hood
and
falling
ruff
which
make
the
wearer
unrecognizable
the
rounded
form
the
individuality
of
figure
and
gait
the
sway
of
the
waist
the
carriage
of
the
head
the
most
intangible
trifles
to
ordinary
eyes
but
to
them
the
easiest
to
discern
in
spite
of
this
shapeless
wrapper
they
could
watch
the
most
appealing
of
dramas
that
of
a
woman
inspired
by
a
genuine
passion
were
she
la
torpille
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
or
madame
de
serizy
on
the
lowest
or
highest
rung
of
the
social
ladder
this
woman
was
an
exquisite
creature
a
flash
from
happy
dreams
these
old
young
men
like
these
young
old
men
felt
so
keen
an
emotion
that
they
envied
lucien
the
splendid
privilege
of
working
such
a
metamorphosis
of
a
woman
into
a
goddess
the
mask
was
there
as
though
she
had
been
alone
with
lucien
for
that
woman
the
thousand
other
persons
did
not
exist
nor
the
evil
and
atmosphere
no
she
moved
under
the
celestial
vault
of
love
as
raphael
s
madonnas
under
their
slender
oval
glory
she
did
not
feel
herself
elbowed
the
fire
of
her
glance
shot
from
the
holes
in
her
mask
and
sank
into
lucien
s
eyes
the
thrill
of
her
frame
seemed
to
answer
to
every
movement
of
her
companion
whence
comes
this
flame
that
radiates
from
a
woman
in
love
and
distinguishes
her
above
all
others
whence
that
lightness
which
seems
to
negative
the
laws
of
gravitation
is
the
soul
become
ambient
has
happiness
a
physical
effluence
the
ingenuousness
of
a
girl
the
graces
of
a
child
were
discernible
under
the
domino
though
they
walked
apart
these
two
beings
suggested
the
figures
of
flora
and
zephyr
as
we
see
them
grouped
by
the
cleverest
sculptors
but
they
were
beyond
sculpture
the
greatest
of
the
arts
lucien
and
his
pretty
domino
were
more
like
the
angels
busied
with
flowers
or
birds
which
gian
bellini
has
placed
beneath
the
effigies
of
the
virgin
mother
lucien
and
this
girl
belonged
to
the
realm
of
fancy
which
is
as
far
above
art
as
cause
is
above
effect
when
the
domino
forgetful
of
everything
was
within
a
yard
of
the
group
bixiou
exclaimed
esther
the
unhappy
girl
turned
her
head
quickly
at
hearing
herself
called
recognized
the
mischievous
speaker
and
bowed
her
head
like
a
dying
creature
that
has
drawn
its
last
breath
a
sharp
laugh
followed
and
the
group
of
men
melted
among
the
crowd
like
a
knot
of
frightened
whisking
into
their
holes
by
the
roadside
rastignac
alone
went
no
further
than
was
necessary
just
to
avoid
making
any
show
of
shunning
lucien
s
flashing
eye
he
could
thus
note
two
phases
of
distress
equally
deep
though
unconfessed
first
the
hapless
torpille
stricken
as
by
a
lightning
stroke
and
then
the
inscrutable
mask
the
only
one
of
the
group
who
had
remained
esther
murmured
a
word
in
lucien
s
ear
just
as
her
knees
gave
way
and
lucien
supporting
her
led
her
away
rastignac
watched
the
pretty
pair
lost
in
meditation
how
did
she
get
her
name
of
la
torpille
asked
a
gloomy
voice
that
struck
to
his
vitals
for
it
was
no
longer
disguised
again
he
has
made
his
escape
muttered
rastignac
to
himself
be
silent
or
i
murder
you
replied
the
mask
changing
his
voice
i
am
satisfied
with
you
you
have
kept
your
word
and
there
is
more
than
one
arm
ready
to
serve
you
henceforth
be
as
silent
as
the
grave
but
before
that
answer
my
well
the
girl
is
such
a
witch
that
she
could
have
magnetized
the
emperor
napoleon
she
could
magnetize
a
man
more
difficult
to
influence
you
yourself
replied
rastignac
and
he
turned
to
go
one
moment
said
the
mask
i
will
prove
to
you
that
you
have
never
seen
me
the
speaker
took
his
mask
off
for
a
moment
rastignac
hesitated
recognizing
nothing
of
the
hideous
being
he
had
known
formerly
at
madame
vauquer
s
the
devil
has
enabled
you
to
change
in
every
particular
excepting
your
eyes
which
it
is
impossible
to
forget
said
he
the
iron
hand
gripped
his
arm
to
enjoin
eternal
secrecy
at
three
in
the
morning
des
lupeaulx
and
finot
found
the
elegant
rastignac
on
the
same
spot
leaning
against
the
column
where
the
terrible
mask
had
left
him
rastignac
had
confessed
to
himself
he
had
been
at
once
priest
and
pentient
culprit
and
judge
he
allowed
himself
to
be
led
away
to
breakfast
and
reached
home
perfectly
tipsy
but
taciturn
the
rue
de
langlade
and
the
adjacent
streets
are
a
blot
on
the
palais
royal
and
the
rue
de
rivoli
this
portion
of
one
of
the
handsomest
quarters
of
paris
will
long
retain
the
stain
of
foulness
left
by
the
hillocks
formed
of
the
middens
of
old
paris
on
which
mills
formerly
stood
these
narrow
streets
dark
and
muddy
where
such
industries
are
carried
on
as
care
little
for
appearances
wear
at
night
an
aspect
of
mystery
full
of
contrasts
on
coming
from
the
regions
of
the
rue
the
rue
and
the
rue
de
richelieu
where
the
crowd
is
constantly
pushing
where
glitter
the
masterpieces
of
industry
fashion
and
art
every
man
to
whom
paris
by
night
is
unknown
would
feel
a
sense
of
dread
and
melancholy
on
finding
himself
in
the
labyrinth
of
little
streets
which
lie
round
that
blaze
of
light
reflected
even
from
the
sky
dense
blackness
is
here
instead
of
floods
of
gaslight
a
dim
here
and
there
sheds
its
doubtful
and
smoky
gleam
and
many
blind
alleys
are
not
lighted
at
all
foot
passengers
are
few
and
walk
fast
the
shops
are
shut
the
few
that
are
open
are
of
a
squalid
kind
a
dirty
unlighted
wineshop
or
a
seller
of
underclothing
and
an
unwholesome
chill
lays
a
clammy
cloak
over
your
shoulders
few
carriages
drive
past
there
are
sinister
places
here
especially
the
rue
de
langlade
the
entrance
to
the
passage
and
the
turnings
of
some
streets
the
municipal
council
has
not
yet
been
to
purge
this
vast
for
prostitution
long
since
made
it
its
headquarters
it
is
perhaps
a
good
thing
for
paris
that
these
alleys
should
be
allowed
to
preserve
their
filthy
aspect
passing
through
them
by
day
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
what
they
become
by
night
they
are
pervaded
by
strange
creatures
of
no
known
world
white
forms
cling
to
the
walls
the
darkness
is
alive
between
the
passenger
and
the
wall
a
dress
steals
by
a
dress
that
moves
and
speaks
doors
suddenly
shout
with
laughter
words
fall
on
the
ear
such
as
rabelais
speaks
of
as
frozen
and
melting
snatches
of
songs
come
up
from
the
pavement
the
noise
is
not
vague
it
means
something
when
it
is
hoarse
it
is
a
voice
but
if
it
suggests
a
song
there
is
nothing
human
about
it
it
is
more
like
a
croak
often
you
hear
a
sharp
whistle
and
then
the
tap
of
has
a
peculiarly
aggressive
and
mocking
ring
this
medley
of
things
makes
you
giddy
atmospheric
conditions
are
reversed
there
it
is
warm
in
winter
and
cool
in
summer
still
whatever
the
weather
this
strange
world
always
wears
the
same
aspect
it
is
the
fantastic
world
of
hoffmann
of
berlin
the
most
mathematical
of
clerks
never
thinks
of
it
as
real
after
returning
through
the
straits
that
lead
into
decent
streets
where
there
are
passengers
shops
and
taverns
modern
administration
or
modern
policy
more
scornful
or
more
shamefaced
than
the
queens
and
kings
of
past
ages
no
longer
dare
look
boldly
in
the
face
of
this
plague
of
our
capitals
measures
of
course
must
change
with
the
times
and
such
as
bear
on
individuals
and
on
their
liberty
are
a
ticklish
matter
still
we
ought
perhaps
to
show
some
breadth
and
boldness
as
to
merely
material
measures
air
light
and
construction
the
moralist
the
artist
and
the
sage
administrator
alike
must
regret
the
old
wooden
galleries
of
the
palais
royal
where
the
lambs
were
to
be
seen
who
will
always
be
found
where
there
are
loungers
and
is
it
not
best
that
the
loungers
should
go
where
they
are
to
be
found
what
is
the
consequence
the
gayest
parts
of
the
boulevards
that
delightfulest
of
promenades
are
impossible
in
the
evening
for
a
family
party
the
police
has
failed
to
take
advantage
of
the
outlet
afforded
by
some
small
streets
to
purge
the
main
street
the
girl
whom
we
have
seen
crushed
by
a
word
at
the
opera
ball
had
been
for
the
last
month
or
two
living
in
the
rue
de
langlade
in
a
very
house
this
structure
stuck
on
to
the
wall
of
an
enormously
large
one
badly
stuccoed
of
no
depth
and
immensely
high
has
all
its
windows
on
the
street
and
bears
some
resemblance
to
a
parrot
s
perch
on
each
floor
are
two
rooms
let
as
separate
flats
there
is
a
narrow
staircase
clinging
to
the
wall
queerly
lighted
by
windows
which
mark
its
ascent
on
the
outer
wall
each
landing
being
indicated
by
a
stink
one
of
the
most
odious
peculiarities
of
paris
the
shop
and
entresol
at
that
time
were
tenanted
by
a
tinman
the
landlord
occupied
the
first
floor
the
four
upper
stories
were
rented
by
very
decent
working
girls
who
were
treated
by
the
portress
and
the
proprietor
with
some
consideration
and
an
obligingness
called
forth
by
the
difficulty
of
letting
a
house
so
oddly
constructed
and
situated
the
occupants
of
the
quarter
are
accounted
for
by
the
existence
there
of
many
houses
of
the
same
character
for
which
trade
has
no
use
and
which
can
only
be
rented
by
the
poorer
kinds
of
industry
of
a
precarious
or
ignominious
nature
at
three
in
the
afternoon
the
portress
who
had
seen
mademoiselle
esther
brought
home
half
dead
by
a
young
man
at
two
in
the
morning
had
just
held
council
with
the
young
woman
of
the
floor
above
who
before
setting
out
in
a
cab
to
join
some
party
of
pleasure
had
expressed
her
uneasiness
about
esther
she
had
not
heard
her
move
esther
was
no
doubt
still
asleep
but
this
slumber
seemed
suspicious
the
portress
alone
in
her
cell
was
regretting
that
she
could
not
go
to
see
what
was
happening
on
the
fourth
floor
where
mademoiselle
esther
lodged
just
as
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
leave
the
tinman
s
son
in
charge
of
her
room
a
sort
of
den
in
a
recess
on
the
entresol
floor
a
cab
stopped
at
the
door
a
man
stepped
out
wrapped
from
head
to
foot
in
a
cloak
evidently
intended
to
conceal
his
dress
or
his
rank
in
life
and
asked
for
mademoiselle
esther
the
portress
at
one
felt
relieved
this
accounted
for
esther
s
silence
and
quietude
as
the
stranger
mounted
the
stairs
above
the
portress
room
she
noticed
silver
buckles
in
his
shoes
and
fancied
she
caught
sight
of
the
black
fringe
of
a
priest
s
sash
she
went
downstairs
and
catechised
the
driver
who
answered
without
speech
and
again
the
woman
understood
the
priest
knocked
received
no
answer
heard
a
slight
gasp
and
forced
the
door
open
with
a
thrust
of
his
shoulder
charity
no
doubt
lent
him
strength
but
in
any
one
else
it
would
have
been
ascribed
to
practice
he
rushed
to
the
inner
room
and
there
found
poor
esther
in
front
of
an
image
of
the
virgin
in
painted
plaster
kneeling
or
rather
doubled
up
on
the
floor
her
hands
folded
the
girl
was
dying
a
brazier
of
burnt
charcoal
told
the
tale
of
that
dreadful
morning
the
domino
cloak
and
hood
were
lying
on
the
ground
the
bed
was
undisturbed
the
unhappy
creature
stricken
to
the
heart
by
a
mortal
thrust
had
no
doubt
made
all
her
arrangements
on
her
return
from
the
opera
a
collapsed
in
the
pool
of
grease
that
filled
the
showed
how
completely
her
last
meditations
had
absorbed
her
a
handkerchief
soaked
with
tears
proved
the
sincerity
of
the
magdalen
s
despair
while
her
classic
attitude
was
that
of
the
irreligious
courtesan
this
abject
repentance
made
the
priest
smile
esther
unskilled
in
dying
had
left
the
door
open
not
thinking
that
the
air
of
two
rooms
would
need
a
larger
amount
of
charcoal
to
make
it
suffocating
she
was
only
stunned
by
the
fumes
the
fresh
air
from
the
staircase
gradually
restored
her
to
a
consciousness
of
her
woes
the
priest
remained
standing
lost
in
gloomy
meditation
without
being
touched
by
the
girl
s
divine
beauty
watching
her
first
movements
as
if
she
had
been
some
animal
his
eyes
went
from
the
crouching
figure
to
the
surrounding
objects
with
evident
indifference
he
looked
at
the
furniture
in
the
room
the
paved
floor
red
polished
and
cold
was
poorly
covered
with
a
shabby
carpet
worn
to
the
string
a
little
bedstead
of
painted
wood
and
shape
was
hung
with
yellow
cotton
printed
with
red
stars
one
armchair
and
two
small
chairs
also
of
painted
wood
and
covered
with
the
same
cotton
print
of
which
the
were
also
made
a
gray
sprigged
with
flowers
blackened
and
greasy
with
age
a
fireplace
full
of
kitchen
utensils
of
the
vilest
kind
two
bundles
of
a
stone
shelf
on
which
lay
some
jewelry
false
and
real
a
pair
of
scissors
a
dirty
pincushion
and
some
white
scented
gloves
an
exquisite
hat
perched
on
the
a
ternaux
shawl
stopping
a
hole
in
the
window
a
handsome
gown
hanging
from
a
nail
a
little
hard
sofa
with
no
cushions
broken
clogs
and
dainty
slippers
boots
that
a
queen
might
have
coveted
cheap
china
plates
cracked
or
chipped
with
fragments
of
a
past
meal
and
nickel
forks
the
plate
of
the
paris
poor
a
basket
full
of
potatoes
and
dirty
linen
with
a
smart
gauze
cap
on
the
top
a
rickety
wardrobe
with
a
glass
door
open
and
empty
and
on
the
shelves
sundry
this
was
the
medley
of
things
dismal
or
pleasing
abject
and
handsome
that
fell
on
his
eye
these
relics
of
splendor
among
the
potsherds
these
household
belongings
so
appropriate
to
the
bohemian
existence
of
the
girl
who
knelt
stricken
in
her
unbuttoned
garments
like
a
horse
dying
in
harness
under
the
broken
shafts
entangled
in
the
reins
did
the
whole
strange
scene
suggest
any
thoughts
to
the
priest
did
he
say
to
himself
that
this
erring
creature
must
at
least
be
disinterested
to
live
in
such
poverty
when
her
lover
was
young
and
rich
did
he
ascribe
the
disorder
of
the
room
to
the
disorder
of
her
life
did
he
feel
pity
or
terror
was
his
charity
moved
to
see
him
his
arms
folded
his
brow
dark
his
lips
set
his
eye
harsh
any
one
must
have
supposed
him
absorbed
in
morose
feelings
of
hatred
considerations
that
jostled
each
other
sinister
schemes
he
was
certainly
insensible
to
the
soft
roundness
of
a
bosom
almost
crushed
under
the
weight
of
the
bowed
shoulders
and
to
the
beautiful
modeling
of
the
crouching
venus
that
was
visible
under
the
black
petticoat
so
closely
was
the
dying
girl
curled
up
the
drooping
head
which
seen
from
behind
showed
the
white
slender
flexible
neck
and
the
fine
shoulders
of
a
figure
did
not
appeal
to
him
he
did
not
raise
esther
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
the
agonizing
gasps
which
showed
that
she
was
returning
to
life
a
fearful
sob
and
a
terrifying
glance
from
the
girl
were
needed
before
he
condescended
to
lift
her
and
he
carried
her
to
the
bed
with
an
ease
that
revealed
enormous
strength
lucien
she
murmured
love
is
there
the
woman
is
not
far
behind
said
the
priest
with
some
bitterness
the
victim
of
parisian
depravity
then
observed
the
dress
worn
by
her
deliverer
and
said
with
a
smile
like
a
child
s
when
it
takes
possession
of
something
longed
for
then
i
shall
not
die
without
being
reconciled
to
heaven
you
may
yet
expiate
your
sins
said
the
priest
moistening
her
forehead
with
water
and
making
her
smell
at
a
cruet
of
vinegar
he
found
in
a
corner
i
feel
that
life
instead
of
departing
is
rushing
in
on
me
said
she
after
accepting
the
father
s
care
and
expressing
her
gratitude
by
simple
gestures
this
engaging
pantomime
such
as
the
graces
might
have
used
to
charm
perfectly
justified
the
nickname
given
to
this
strange
girl
do
you
feel
better
said
the
priest
giving
her
a
glass
of
sugar
and
water
to
drink
this
man
seemed
accustomed
to
such
queer
establishments
he
knew
all
about
it
he
was
quite
at
home
there
this
privilege
of
being
everywhere
at
home
is
the
prerogative
of
kings
courtesans
and
thieves
when
you
feel
quite
well
this
strange
priest
went
on
after
a
pause
you
must
tell
me
the
reasons
which
prompted
you
to
commit
this
last
crime
this
attempted
my
story
is
very
simple
father
replied
she
three
months
ago
i
was
living
the
evil
life
to
which
i
was
born
i
was
the
lowest
and
vilest
of
creatures
now
i
am
only
the
most
unhappy
excuse
me
from
telling
you
the
history
of
my
poor
mother
who
was
murdered
by
a
captain
in
a
house
of
said
the
priest
interrupting
the
penitent
i
know
your
origin
and
i
know
that
if
a
being
of
your
sex
can
ever
be
excused
for
leading
a
life
of
shame
it
is
you
who
have
always
lacked
good
alas
i
was
never
baptized
and
have
no
religious
all
may
yet
be
remedied
then
replied
the
priest
provided
that
your
faith
your
repentance
are
sincere
and
without
ulterior
lucien
and
god
fill
my
heart
said
she
with
ingenuous
pathos
you
might
have
said
god
and
lucien
answered
the
priest
smiling
you
remind
me
of
the
purpose
of
my
visit
omit
nothing
that
concerns
that
young
you
have
come
from
him
she
asked
with
a
tender
look
that
would
have
touched
any
other
priest
oh
he
thought
i
should
do
it
no
replied
the
priest
it
is
not
your
death
but
your
life
that
we
are
interested
in
come
explain
your
position
toward
each
in
one
word
said
she
the
poor
child
quaked
at
the
priest
s
stern
tone
but
as
a
woman
quakes
who
has
long
ceased
to
be
surprised
at
brutality
lucien
is
lucien
said
she
the
handsomest
young
man
the
kindest
soul
alive
if
you
know
him
my
love
must
seem
to
you
quite
natural
i
met
him
by
chance
three
months
ago
at
the
theatre
where
i
went
one
day
when
i
had
leave
for
we
had
a
day
a
week
at
madame
meynardie
s
where
i
then
was
next
day
you
understand
i
went
out
without
leave
love
had
come
into
my
heart
and
had
so
completely
changed
me
that
on
my
return
from
the
theatre
i
did
not
know
myself
i
had
a
horror
of
myself
lucien
would
never
have
known
instead
of
telling
him
what
i
was
i
gave
him
my
address
at
these
rooms
where
a
friend
of
mine
was
then
living
who
was
so
kind
as
to
give
them
up
to
me
i
swear
on
my
sacred
word
you
must
not
is
it
swearing
to
give
your
sacred
word
well
from
that
day
i
have
worked
in
this
room
like
a
lost
creature
at
at
sous
apiece
so
as
to
live
by
honest
labor
for
a
month
i
have
had
nothing
to
eat
but
potatoes
that
i
might
keep
myself
a
good
girl
and
worthy
of
lucien
who
loves
me
and
respects
me
as
a
pattern
of
virtue
i
have
made
my
declaration
before
the
police
to
recover
my
rights
and
submitted
to
two
years
surveillance
they
are
ready
enough
to
enter
your
name
on
the
lists
of
disgrace
but
make
every
difficulty
about
scratching
it
out
again
all
i
asked
of
heaven
was
to
enable
me
to
keep
my
resolution
i
shall
be
nineteen
in
the
month
of
april
at
my
age
there
is
still
a
chance
it
seems
to
me
that
i
was
never
born
till
three
months
i
prayed
to
god
every
morning
that
lucien
might
never
know
what
my
former
life
had
been
i
bought
that
virgin
you
see
there
and
i
prayed
to
her
in
my
own
way
for
i
do
not
know
any
prayers
i
can
not
read
nor
write
and
i
have
never
been
into
a
church
i
have
never
seen
anything
of
god
excepting
in
processions
out
of
and
what
do
you
say
to
the
virgin
i
talk
to
her
as
i
talk
to
lucien
with
all
my
soul
till
i
make
him
oh
so
he
cries
with
joy
said
she
eagerly
poor
dear
boy
we
understand
each
other
so
well
that
we
have
but
one
soul
he
is
so
nice
so
fond
so
sweet
in
heart
and
mind
and
manners
he
says
he
is
a
poet
i
say
he
is
forgive
me
you
priests
you
see
don
t
know
what
love
is
but
in
fact
only
girls
like
me
know
enough
of
men
to
appreciate
such
as
lucien
a
lucien
you
see
is
as
rare
as
a
woman
without
sin
when
you
come
across
him
you
can
love
no
one
else
so
there
but
such
a
being
must
have
his
fellow
so
i
want
to
be
worthy
to
be
loved
by
my
lucien
that
is
where
my
trouble
began
last
evening
at
the
opera
i
was
recognized
by
some
young
men
who
have
no
more
feeling
than
a
tiger
has
pity
for
that
matter
i
could
come
round
the
tiger
the
veil
of
innocence
i
had
tried
to
wear
was
worn
off
their
laughter
pierced
my
brain
and
my
heart
do
not
think
you
have
saved
me
i
shall
die
of
your
veil
of
innocence
said
the
priest
then
you
have
treated
lucien
with
the
sternest
severity
oh
father
how
can
you
who
know
him
ask
me
such
a
question
she
replied
with
a
smile
who
can
resist
a
god
do
not
be
blasphemous
said
the
priest
mildly
no
one
can
be
like
god
exaggeration
is
out
of
place
with
true
love
you
had
not
a
pure
and
genuine
love
for
your
idol
if
you
had
undergone
the
conversion
you
boast
of
having
felt
you
would
have
acquired
the
virtues
which
are
a
part
of
womanhood
you
would
have
known
the
charm
of
chastity
the
refinements
of
modesty
the
two
virtues
that
are
the
glory
of
a
you
do
not
esther
s
gesture
of
horror
was
seen
by
the
priest
but
it
had
no
effect
on
the
impassibility
of
her
confessor
yes
for
you
love
him
for
yourself
and
not
for
himself
for
the
temporal
enjoyments
that
delight
you
and
not
for
love
itself
if
he
has
thus
taken
possession
of
you
you
can
not
have
felt
that
sacred
thrill
that
is
inspired
by
a
being
on
whom
god
has
set
the
seal
of
the
most
adorable
perfections
has
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
you
would
degrade
him
by
your
past
impurity
that
you
would
corrupt
a
child
by
the
overpowering
seductions
which
earned
you
your
nickname
glorious
in
infamy
you
have
been
illogical
with
yourself
and
your
passion
of
a
day
of
a
day
she
repeated
raising
her
eyes
by
what
other
name
can
you
call
a
love
that
is
not
eternal
that
does
not
unite
us
in
the
future
life
of
the
christian
to
the
being
we
love
ah
i
will
be
a
catholic
she
cried
in
a
hollow
vehement
tone
that
would
have
earned
her
the
mercy
of
the
lord
can
a
girl
who
has
received
neither
the
baptism
of
the
church
nor
that
of
knowledge
who
can
neither
read
nor
write
nor
pray
who
can
not
take
a
step
without
the
stones
in
the
street
rising
up
to
accuse
her
noteworthy
only
for
the
fugitive
gift
of
beauty
which
sickness
may
destroy
can
such
a
vile
degraded
creature
fully
aware
too
of
her
degradation
for
if
you
had
been
ignorant
of
it
and
less
devoted
you
would
have
been
more
excusable
can
the
intended
victim
to
suicide
and
hell
hope
to
be
the
wife
of
lucien
de
rubempre
every
word
was
a
poniard
thrust
piercing
the
depths
of
her
heart
at
every
word
the
louder
sobs
and
abundant
tears
of
the
desperate
girl
showed
the
power
with
which
light
had
flashed
upon
an
intelligence
as
pure
as
that
of
a
savage
upon
a
soul
at
length
aroused
upon
a
nature
over
which
depravity
had
laid
a
sheet
of
foul
ice
now
thawed
in
the
sunshine
of
faith
why
did
i
not
die
was
the
only
thought
that
found
utterance
in
the
midst
of
a
torrent
of
ideas
that
racked
and
ravaged
her
brain
my
daughter
said
the
terrible
judge
there
is
a
love
which
is
unconfessed
before
men
but
of
which
the
secret
is
received
by
the
angels
with
smiles
of
what
is
that
love
without
hope
when
it
inspires
our
life
when
it
fills
us
with
the
spirit
of
sacrifice
when
it
ennobles
every
act
by
the
thought
of
reaching
some
ideal
perfection
yes
the
angels
approve
of
such
love
it
leads
to
the
knowledge
of
god
to
aim
at
perfection
in
order
to
be
worthy
of
the
one
you
love
to
make
for
him
a
thousand
secret
sacrifices
adoring
him
from
afar
giving
your
blood
drop
by
drop
abnegating
your
never
feeling
any
pride
or
anger
as
regards
him
even
concealing
from
him
all
knowledge
of
the
dreadful
jealousy
he
fires
in
your
heart
giving
him
all
he
wishes
were
it
to
your
own
loss
loving
what
he
loves
always
turning
your
face
to
him
to
follow
him
without
his
knowing
it
such
love
as
that
religion
would
have
forgiven
it
is
no
offence
to
laws
human
or
divine
and
would
have
led
you
into
another
road
than
that
of
your
foul
as
she
heard
this
horrible
verdict
uttered
in
a
word
and
such
a
word
and
spoken
in
such
a
tone
esther
s
spirit
rose
up
in
fairly
legitimate
distrust
this
word
was
like
a
giving
warning
of
a
storm
about
to
break
she
looked
at
the
priest
and
felt
the
grip
on
her
vitals
which
wrings
the
bravest
when
face
to
face
with
sudden
and
imminent
danger
no
eye
could
have
read
what
was
passing
in
this
man
s
mind
but
the
boldest
would
have
found
more
to
quail
at
than
to
hope
for
in
the
expression
of
his
eyes
once
bright
and
yellow
like
those
of
a
tiger
but
now
shrouded
from
austerities
and
privations
with
a
haze
like
that
which
overhangs
the
horizon
in
the
when
though
the
earth
is
hot
and
luminous
the
mist
makes
it
indistinct
and
dim
almost
invisible
the
gravity
of
a
spaniard
the
deep
furrows
which
the
myriad
scars
of
virulent
smallpox
made
hideously
like
broken
ruts
were
ploughed
into
his
face
which
was
sallow
and
tanned
by
the
sun
the
hardness
of
this
countenance
was
all
the
more
conspicuous
being
framed
in
the
meagre
dry
wig
of
a
priest
who
takes
no
care
of
his
person
a
black
wig
looking
rusty
in
the
light
his
athletic
frame
his
hands
like
an
old
soldier
s
his
broad
strong
shoulders
were
those
of
the
caryatides
which
the
architects
of
the
middle
ages
introduced
into
some
italian
palaces
remotely
imitated
in
those
of
the
front
of
the
theatre
the
least
observer
might
have
seen
that
fiery
passions
or
some
unwonted
accident
must
have
thrown
this
man
into
the
bosom
of
the
church
certainly
none
but
the
most
tremendous
shocks
of
lightning
could
have
changed
him
if
indeed
such
a
nature
were
susceptible
of
change
women
who
have
lived
the
life
that
esther
had
so
violently
repudiated
come
to
feel
absolute
indifference
as
to
the
critics
of
our
day
who
may
be
compared
with
them
in
some
respects
and
who
feel
at
last
perfect
disregard
of
the
formulas
of
art
they
have
read
so
many
books
they
see
so
many
pass
away
they
are
so
much
accustomed
to
written
pages
they
have
gone
through
so
many
plots
they
have
seen
so
many
dramas
they
have
written
so
many
articles
without
saying
what
they
meant
and
have
so
often
been
treasonable
to
the
cause
of
art
in
favor
of
their
personal
likings
and
aversions
that
they
acquire
a
feeling
of
disgust
of
everything
and
yet
continue
to
pass
judgment
it
needs
a
miracle
to
make
such
a
writer
produce
sound
work
just
as
it
needs
another
miracle
to
give
birth
to
pure
and
noble
love
in
the
heart
of
a
courtesan
the
tone
and
manner
of
this
priest
who
seemed
to
have
escaped
from
a
picture
by
zurbaran
struck
this
poor
girl
as
so
hostile
little
as
externals
affected
her
that
she
perceived
herself
to
be
less
the
object
of
his
solitude
than
the
instrument
he
needed
for
some
scheme
being
unable
to
distinguish
between
the
insinuating
tongue
of
personal
interest
and
the
unction
of
true
charity
for
we
must
be
acutely
awake
to
recognize
false
coin
when
it
is
offered
by
a
friend
she
felt
herself
as
it
were
in
the
talons
of
some
fierce
and
monstrous
bird
of
prey
who
after
hovering
over
her
for
long
had
pounced
down
on
her
and
in
her
terror
she
cried
in
a
voice
of
alarm
i
thought
it
was
a
priest
s
duty
to
console
us
and
you
are
killing
me
at
this
innocent
outcry
the
priest
started
and
paused
he
meditated
a
moment
before
replying
during
that
instant
the
two
persons
so
strangely
brought
together
studied
each
other
cautiously
the
priest
understood
the
girl
though
the
girl
could
not
understand
the
priest
he
no
doubt
put
aside
some
plan
which
had
threatened
the
unhappy
esther
and
came
back
to
his
first
ideas
we
are
physicians
of
the
soul
said
he
in
a
mild
voice
and
we
know
what
remedies
suit
their
much
must
be
forgiven
to
the
wretched
said
esther
she
fancied
she
had
been
wrong
she
slipped
off
the
bed
threw
herself
at
the
man
s
feet
kissed
his
gown
with
deep
humility
and
looked
up
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
tears
i
thought
i
had
done
so
much
she
said
listen
my
child
your
terrible
reputation
has
cast
lucien
s
family
into
grief
they
are
afraid
and
not
without
reason
that
you
may
lead
him
into
dissipation
into
endless
folly
that
is
true
it
was
i
who
got
him
to
the
ball
to
mystify
you
are
handsome
enough
to
make
him
wish
to
triumph
in
you
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
to
show
you
with
pride
and
make
you
an
object
for
display
and
if
he
wasted
money
only
but
he
will
waste
his
time
his
powers
he
will
lose
his
inclination
for
the
fine
future
his
friends
can
secure
to
him
instead
of
being
some
day
an
ambassador
rich
admired
and
triumphant
he
like
so
many
debauchees
who
choke
their
talents
in
the
mud
of
paris
will
have
been
the
lover
of
a
degraded
woman
as
for
you
after
rising
for
a
time
to
the
level
of
a
sphere
of
elegance
you
will
presently
sink
back
to
your
former
life
for
you
have
not
in
you
the
strength
bestowed
by
a
good
education
to
enable
you
to
resist
vice
and
think
of
the
future
you
would
no
more
be
able
to
break
with
the
women
of
your
own
class
than
you
have
broken
with
the
men
who
shamed
you
at
the
opera
this
morning
lucien
s
true
friends
alarmed
by
his
passion
for
you
have
dogged
his
steps
and
know
all
filled
with
horror
they
have
sent
me
to
you
to
sound
your
views
and
decide
your
fate
but
though
they
are
powerful
enough
to
clear
a
out
of
the
young
man
s
way
they
are
merciful
understand
this
child
a
girl
whom
lucien
loves
has
claims
on
their
regard
as
a
true
christian
worships
the
slough
on
which
by
chance
the
divine
light
falls
i
came
to
be
the
instrument
of
a
beneficent
purpose
still
if
i
had
found
you
utterly
reprobate
armed
with
effrontery
and
astuteness
corrupt
to
the
marrow
deaf
to
the
voice
of
repentance
i
should
have
abandoned
you
to
their
wrath
the
release
civil
and
political
which
it
is
so
hard
to
win
which
the
police
is
so
right
to
withhold
for
a
time
in
the
interests
of
society
and
which
i
heard
you
long
for
with
all
the
ardor
of
true
repentance
is
here
said
the
priest
taking
an
paper
out
of
his
belt
you
were
seen
yesterday
this
letter
of
release
is
dated
you
see
how
powerful
the
people
are
who
take
an
interest
in
at
the
sight
of
this
document
esther
was
so
ingenuously
overcome
by
the
convulsive
agitation
produced
by
joy
that
a
fixed
smile
parted
her
lips
like
that
of
a
crazy
creature
the
priest
paused
looking
at
the
girl
to
see
whether
when
once
she
had
lost
the
horrible
strength
which
corrupt
natures
find
in
corruption
itself
and
was
thrown
back
on
her
frail
and
delicate
primitive
nature
she
could
endure
so
much
excitement
if
she
had
been
a
deceitful
courtesan
esther
would
have
acted
a
part
but
now
that
she
was
innocent
and
herself
once
more
she
might
perhaps
die
as
a
blind
man
cured
may
lose
his
sight
again
if
he
is
exposed
to
too
bright
a
light
at
this
moment
this
man
looked
into
the
very
depths
of
human
nature
but
his
calmness
was
terrible
in
its
rigidity
a
cold
alp
and
near
to
heaven
impenetrable
and
frowning
with
flanks
of
granite
and
yet
beneficent
such
women
are
essentially
impressionable
beings
passing
without
reason
from
the
most
idiotic
distrust
to
absolute
confidence
in
this
respect
they
are
lower
than
animals
extreme
in
everything
in
their
joy
and
despair
in
their
religion
and
irreligion
they
would
almost
all
go
mad
if
they
were
not
decimated
by
the
mortality
peculiar
to
their
class
and
if
happy
chances
did
not
lift
one
now
and
then
from
the
slough
in
which
they
dwell
to
understand
the
very
depths
of
the
wretchedness
of
this
horrible
existence
one
must
know
how
far
in
madness
a
creature
can
go
without
remaining
there
by
studying
la
torpille
s
violent
ecstasy
at
the
priest
s
feet
the
poor
girl
gazed
at
the
paper
of
release
with
an
expression
which
dante
has
overlooked
and
which
surpassed
the
inventiveness
of
his
inferno
but
a
reaction
came
with
tears
esther
rose
threw
her
arms
round
the
priest
s
neck
laid
her
head
on
his
breast
which
she
wetted
with
her
weeping
kissing
the
coarse
stuff
that
covered
that
heart
of
steel
as
if
she
fain
would
touch
it
she
seized
hold
of
him
she
covered
his
hands
with
kisses
she
poured
out
in
a
sacred
effusion
of
gratitude
her
most
coaxing
caresses
lavished
fond
names
on
him
saying
again
and
again
in
the
midst
of
her
honeyed
words
let
me
have
it
in
a
thousand
different
tones
of
voice
she
wrapped
him
in
tenderness
covered
him
with
her
looks
with
a
swiftness
that
found
him
defenceless
at
last
she
charmed
away
his
wrath
the
priest
perceived
how
well
the
girl
had
deserved
her
nickname
he
understood
how
difficult
it
was
to
resist
this
bewitching
creature
he
suddenly
comprehended
lucien
s
love
and
just
what
must
have
fascinated
the
poet
such
a
passion
hides
among
a
thousand
temptations
a
hook
which
is
most
apt
to
catch
the
lofty
soul
of
an
artist
these
passions
inexplicable
to
the
vulgar
are
perfectly
accounted
for
by
the
thirst
for
ideal
beauty
which
is
characteristic
of
a
creative
mind
for
are
we
not
in
some
degree
akin
to
the
angels
whose
task
it
is
to
bring
the
guilty
to
a
better
mind
are
we
not
creative
when
we
purify
such
a
creature
how
delightful
it
is
to
harmonize
moral
with
physical
beauty
what
joy
and
pride
if
we
succeed
how
noble
a
task
is
that
which
has
no
instrument
but
love
such
alliances
made
famous
by
the
example
of
aristotle
socrates
plato
alcibiades
cethegus
and
pompey
and
yet
so
monstrous
in
the
eyes
of
the
vulgar
are
based
on
the
same
feeling
that
prompted
louis
xiv
to
build
versailles
or
that
makes
men
rush
into
any
ruinous
enterprise
into
converting
the
miasma
of
a
marsh
into
a
mass
of
fragrance
surrounded
by
living
waters
placing
a
lake
at
the
top
of
a
hill
as
the
prince
de
conti
did
at
nointel
or
producing
swiss
scenery
at
cassan
like
bergeret
the
in
short
it
is
the
application
of
art
in
the
realm
of
morals
the
priest
ashamed
of
having
yielded
to
this
weakness
hastily
pushed
esther
away
and
she
sat
down
quite
abashed
for
he
said
you
are
still
the
and
he
calmly
replaced
the
paper
in
his
sash
esther
like
a
child
who
has
a
single
wish
in
its
head
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
spot
where
the
document
lay
hidden
my
child
the
priest
went
on
after
a
pause
your
mother
was
a
jewess
and
you
have
not
been
baptized
but
on
the
other
hand
you
have
never
been
taken
to
the
synagogue
you
are
in
the
limbo
where
little
children
are
little
children
she
echoed
in
a
tenderly
pathetic
tone
as
you
are
on
the
books
of
the
police
a
cipher
outside
the
pale
of
social
beings
the
priest
went
on
unmoved
if
love
seen
as
it
swept
past
led
you
to
believe
three
months
since
that
you
were
then
born
you
must
feel
that
since
that
day
you
have
been
really
an
infant
you
must
therefore
be
led
as
if
you
were
a
child
you
must
be
completely
changed
and
i
will
undertake
to
make
you
unrecognizable
to
begin
with
you
must
forget
the
words
crushed
the
poor
girl
s
heart
she
raised
her
eyes
to
the
priest
and
shook
her
head
she
could
not
speak
finding
the
executioner
in
the
deliverer
again
at
any
rate
you
must
give
up
seeing
him
he
went
on
i
will
take
you
to
a
religious
house
where
young
girls
of
the
best
families
are
educated
there
you
will
become
a
catholic
you
will
be
trained
in
the
practice
of
christian
exercises
you
will
be
taught
religion
you
may
come
out
an
accomplished
young
lady
chaste
pure
well
brought
up
if
the
man
lifted
up
a
finger
and
paused
if
he
went
on
you
feel
brave
enough
to
leave
the
torpille
behind
you
ah
cried
the
poor
thing
to
whom
each
word
had
been
like
a
note
of
some
melody
to
which
the
gates
of
paradise
were
slowly
opening
ah
if
it
were
possible
to
shed
all
my
blood
here
and
have
it
renewed
listen
to
she
was
silent
your
future
fate
depends
on
your
power
of
forgetting
think
of
the
extent
to
which
you
pledge
yourself
a
word
a
gesture
which
betrays
la
torpille
will
kill
lucien
s
wife
a
word
murmured
in
a
dream
an
involuntary
thought
an
immodest
glance
a
gesture
of
impatience
a
reminiscence
of
dissipation
an
omission
a
shake
of
the
head
that
might
reveal
what
you
know
or
what
is
known
about
you
for
your
woes
yes
yes
father
said
the
girl
with
the
exaltation
of
a
saint
to
walk
in
shoes
of
iron
and
smile
to
live
in
a
pair
of
stays
set
with
nails
and
maintain
the
grace
of
a
dancer
to
eat
bread
salted
with
ashes
to
drink
wormwood
all
will
be
sweet
and
easy
she
fell
again
on
her
knees
she
kissed
the
priest
s
shoes
she
melted
into
tears
that
wetted
them
she
clasped
his
knees
and
clung
to
them
murmuring
foolish
words
as
she
wept
for
joy
her
long
and
beautiful
light
hair
waved
to
the
ground
a
sort
of
carpet
under
the
feet
of
the
celestial
messenger
whom
she
saw
as
gloomy
and
hard
as
ever
when
she
lifted
herself
up
and
looked
at
him
what
have
i
done
to
offend
you
cried
she
quite
frightened
i
have
heard
of
a
woman
such
as
i
am
who
washed
the
feet
of
jesus
with
perfumes
alas
virtue
has
made
me
so
poor
that
i
have
nothing
but
tears
to
offer
have
you
not
understood
he
answered
in
a
cruel
voice
i
tell
you
you
must
be
able
to
come
out
of
the
house
to
which
i
shall
take
you
so
completely
changed
physically
and
morally
that
no
man
or
woman
you
have
ever
known
will
be
able
to
call
you
esther
and
make
you
look
round
yesterday
your
love
could
not
give
you
strength
enough
so
completely
to
bury
the
prostitute
that
she
could
never
reappear
and
again
she
revives
in
adoration
which
is
due
to
none
but
was
it
not
he
who
sent
you
to
me
said
she
if
during
the
course
of
your
education
you
should
even
see
lucien
all
would
be
lost
he
went
on
remember
who
will
comfort
him
said
she
what
was
it
that
you
comforted
him
for
asked
the
priest
in
a
tone
in
which
for
the
first
time
during
this
scene
there
was
a
nervous
quaver
i
do
not
know
he
was
often
sad
when
he
sad
said
the
priest
did
he
tell
you
why
never
answered
she
he
was
sad
at
loving
such
a
girl
as
you
exclaimed
he
alas
and
well
he
might
be
said
she
with
deep
humility
i
am
the
most
despicable
creature
of
my
sex
and
i
could
find
favor
in
his
eyes
only
by
the
greatness
of
my
that
love
must
give
you
the
courage
to
obey
me
blindly
if
i
were
to
take
you
straight
from
hence
to
the
house
where
you
are
to
be
educated
everybody
here
would
tell
lucien
that
you
had
gone
away
sunday
with
a
priest
he
might
follow
in
your
tracks
in
the
course
of
a
week
the
portress
not
seeing
me
again
might
suppose
me
to
be
what
i
am
not
so
one
evening
this
day
week
at
seven
o
clock
go
out
quietly
and
get
into
a
cab
that
will
be
waiting
for
you
at
the
bottom
of
the
rue
des
frondeurs
during
this
week
avoid
lucien
find
excuses
have
him
sent
from
the
door
and
if
he
should
come
in
go
up
to
some
friend
s
room
i
shall
know
if
you
have
seen
him
and
in
that
event
all
will
be
at
an
end
i
shall
not
even
come
back
these
eight
days
you
will
need
to
make
up
some
suitable
clothing
and
to
hide
your
look
of
a
prostitute
said
he
laying
a
purse
on
the
there
is
something
in
your
manner
in
your
clothes
something
indefinable
which
is
well
known
to
parisians
and
proclaims
you
what
you
are
have
you
never
met
in
the
streets
or
on
the
boulevards
a
modest
and
virtuous
girl
walking
with
her
mother
oh
yes
to
my
sorrow
the
sight
of
a
mother
and
daughter
is
one
of
our
most
cruel
punishments
it
arouses
the
remorse
that
lurks
in
the
innermost
folds
of
our
hearts
and
that
is
consuming
i
know
too
well
all
i
well
then
you
know
how
you
should
look
next
sunday
said
the
priest
rising
oh
said
she
teach
me
one
real
prayer
before
you
go
that
i
may
pray
to
it
was
a
touching
thing
to
see
the
priest
making
this
girl
repeat
ave
and
in
french
that
is
very
fine
said
esther
when
she
had
repeated
these
two
grand
and
universal
utterances
of
the
catholic
faith
without
making
a
mistake
what
is
your
name
she
asked
the
priest
when
he
took
leave
of
her
carlos
herrera
i
am
a
spaniard
banished
from
my
esther
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
she
was
no
longer
the
courtesan
she
was
an
angel
rising
after
a
fall
in
a
religious
institution
famous
for
the
aristocratic
and
pious
teaching
imparted
there
one
monday
morning
in
the
beginning
of
march
the
pupils
found
their
pretty
flock
increased
by
a
newcomer
whose
beauty
triumphed
without
dispute
not
only
over
that
of
her
companions
but
over
the
special
details
of
beauty
which
were
found
severally
in
perfection
in
each
one
of
them
in
france
it
is
extremely
rare
not
to
say
impossible
to
meet
with
the
thirty
points
of
perfection
described
in
persian
verse
and
engraved
it
is
said
in
the
seraglio
which
are
needed
to
make
a
woman
absolutely
beautiful
though
in
france
the
whole
is
seldom
seen
we
find
exquisite
parts
as
to
that
imposing
union
which
sculpture
tries
to
produce
and
has
produced
in
a
few
rare
examples
like
the
diana
and
the
callipyge
it
is
the
privileged
possession
of
greece
and
asia
minor
esther
came
from
that
cradle
of
the
human
race
her
mother
was
a
jewess
the
jews
though
so
often
deteriorated
by
their
contact
with
other
nations
have
among
their
many
races
families
in
which
this
sublime
type
of
asiatic
beauty
has
been
preserved
when
they
are
not
repulsively
hideous
they
present
the
splendid
characteristics
of
armenian
beauty
esther
would
have
carried
off
the
prize
at
the
seraglio
she
had
the
thirty
points
harmoniously
combined
far
from
having
damaged
the
finish
of
her
modeling
and
the
freshness
of
her
flesh
her
strange
life
had
given
her
the
mysterious
charm
of
womanhood
it
is
no
longer
the
close
waxy
texture
of
green
fruit
and
not
yet
the
warm
glow
of
maturity
there
is
still
the
scent
of
the
flower
a
few
days
longer
spent
in
dissolute
living
and
she
would
have
been
too
fat
this
abundant
health
this
perfection
of
the
animal
in
a
being
in
whom
voluptuousness
took
the
place
of
thought
must
be
a
remarkable
fact
in
the
eyes
of
physiologists
a
circumstance
so
rare
that
it
may
be
called
impossible
in
very
young
girls
was
that
her
hands
incomparably
fine
in
shape
were
as
soft
transparent
and
white
as
those
of
a
woman
after
the
birth
of
her
second
child
she
had
exactly
the
hair
and
the
foot
for
which
the
duchesse
de
berri
was
so
famous
hair
so
thick
that
no
hairdresser
could
gather
it
into
his
hand
and
so
long
that
it
fell
to
the
ground
in
rings
for
esther
was
of
that
medium
height
which
makes
a
woman
a
sort
of
toy
to
be
taken
up
and
set
down
taken
up
again
and
carried
without
fatigue
her
skin
as
fine
as
of
a
warm
amber
hue
showing
the
purple
veins
was
satiny
without
dryness
soft
without
being
clammy
esther
excessively
strong
though
apparently
fragile
arrested
attention
by
one
feature
that
is
conspicuous
in
the
faces
in
which
raphael
has
shown
his
most
artistic
feeling
for
raphael
is
the
painter
who
has
most
studied
and
best
rendered
jewish
beauty
this
remarkable
effect
was
produced
by
the
depth
of
the
under
which
the
eye
moved
free
from
its
setting
the
arch
of
the
brow
was
so
accurate
as
to
resemble
the
groining
of
a
vault
when
youth
lends
this
beautiful
hollow
its
pure
and
diaphanous
coloring
and
edges
it
with
eyebrows
when
the
light
stealing
into
the
circular
cavity
beneath
lingers
there
with
a
rosy
hue
there
are
tender
treasures
in
it
to
delight
a
lover
beauties
to
drive
a
painter
to
despair
those
luminous
curves
where
the
shadows
have
a
golden
tone
that
tissue
as
firm
as
a
sinew
and
as
mobile
as
the
most
delicate
membrane
is
a
crowning
achievement
of
nature
the
eye
at
rest
within
is
like
a
miraculous
egg
in
a
nest
of
silken
wings
but
as
time
goes
on
this
marvel
acquires
a
dreadful
melancholy
when
passions
have
laid
dark
smears
on
those
fine
forms
when
grief
had
furrowed
that
network
of
delicate
veins
esther
s
nationality
proclaimed
itself
in
this
oriental
modeling
of
her
eyes
with
their
turkish
lids
their
color
was
a
which
by
night
took
on
the
blue
sheen
of
a
raven
s
wing
it
was
only
the
extreme
tenderness
of
her
expression
that
could
moderate
their
fire
only
those
races
that
are
native
to
deserts
have
in
the
eye
the
power
of
fascinating
everybody
for
any
woman
can
fascinate
some
one
person
their
eyes
preserve
no
doubt
something
of
the
infinitude
they
have
gazed
on
has
nature
in
her
foresight
armed
their
retina
with
some
reflecting
background
to
enable
them
to
endure
the
mirage
of
the
sand
the
torrents
of
sunshine
and
the
burning
cobalt
of
the
sky
or
do
human
beings
like
other
creatures
derive
something
from
the
surroundings
among
which
they
grow
up
and
preserve
for
ages
the
qualities
they
have
imbibed
from
them
the
great
solution
of
this
problem
of
race
lies
perhaps
in
the
question
itself
instincts
are
living
facts
and
their
cause
dwells
in
past
necessity
variety
in
animals
is
the
result
of
the
exercise
of
these
instincts
to
convince
ourselves
of
this
truth
it
is
enough
to
extend
to
the
herd
of
mankind
the
observation
recently
made
on
flocks
of
spanish
and
english
sheep
which
in
low
meadows
where
pasture
is
abundant
feed
side
by
side
in
close
array
but
on
mountains
where
grass
is
scarce
scatter
apart
take
these
two
kinds
of
sheep
transfer
them
to
switzerland
or
france
the
mountain
breeds
will
feed
apart
even
in
a
lowland
meadow
of
thick
grass
the
lowland
sheep
will
keep
together
even
on
an
alp
hardly
will
a
succession
of
generations
eliminate
acquired
and
transmitted
instincts
after
a
century
the
highland
spirit
reappears
in
a
refractory
lamb
just
as
after
eighteen
centuries
of
exile
the
spirit
of
the
east
shone
in
esther
s
eyes
and
features
her
look
had
no
terrible
fascination
it
shed
a
mild
warmth
it
was
pathetic
without
being
startling
and
the
sternest
wills
were
melted
in
its
flame
esther
had
conquered
hatred
she
had
astonished
the
depraved
souls
of
paris
in
short
that
look
and
the
softness
of
her
skin
had
earned
her
the
terrible
nickname
which
had
just
led
her
to
the
verge
of
the
grave
everything
about
her
was
in
harmony
with
these
characteristics
of
the
peri
of
the
burning
sands
her
forehead
was
firmly
and
proudly
molded
her
nose
like
that
of
the
arab
race
was
delicate
and
narrow
with
oval
nostrils
well
set
and
open
at
the
base
her
mouth
fresh
and
red
was
a
rose
unblemished
by
a
flaw
dissipation
had
left
no
trace
there
her
chin
rounded
as
though
some
amorous
sculptor
had
polished
its
fulness
was
as
white
as
milk
one
thing
only
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
remedy
betrayed
the
courtesan
fallen
very
low
her
broken
nails
which
needed
time
to
recover
their
shape
so
much
had
they
been
spoiled
by
the
vulgarest
household
tasks
the
young
boarders
began
by
being
jealous
of
these
marvels
of
beauty
but
they
ended
by
admiring
them
before
the
first
week
was
at
an
end
they
were
all
attached
to
the
artless
jewess
for
they
were
interested
in
the
unknown
misfortunes
of
a
girl
of
eighteen
who
could
neither
read
nor
write
to
whom
all
knowledge
and
instruction
were
new
and
who
was
to
earn
for
the
archbishop
the
triumph
of
having
converted
a
jewess
to
catholicism
and
giving
the
convent
a
festival
in
her
baptism
they
forgave
her
beauty
finding
themselves
her
superiors
in
education
esther
very
soon
caught
the
manners
the
accent
the
carriage
and
attitudes
of
these
girls
in
short
her
first
nature
reasserted
itself
the
change
was
so
complete
that
on
his
first
visit
herrera
was
astonished
as
it
would
seem
and
the
mother
superior
congratulated
him
on
his
ward
never
in
their
existence
as
teachers
had
these
sisters
met
with
a
more
charming
nature
more
christian
meekness
true
modesty
nor
a
greater
eagerness
to
learn
when
a
girl
has
suffered
such
misery
as
had
overwhelmed
this
poor
child
and
looks
forward
to
such
a
reward
as
the
spaniard
held
out
to
esther
it
is
hard
if
she
does
not
realize
the
miracles
of
the
early
church
which
the
jesuits
revived
in
paraguay
she
is
edifying
said
the
superior
kissing
her
on
the
brow
and
this
essentially
catholic
word
tells
all
in
recreation
hours
esther
would
question
her
companions
but
discreetly
as
to
the
simplest
matters
in
fashionable
life
which
to
her
were
like
the
first
strange
ideas
of
life
to
a
child
when
she
heard
that
she
was
to
be
dressed
in
white
on
the
day
of
her
baptism
and
first
communion
that
she
should
wear
a
white
satin
fillet
white
bows
white
shoes
white
gloves
and
white
rosettes
in
her
hair
she
melted
into
tears
to
the
amazement
of
her
companions
it
was
the
reverse
of
the
scene
of
jephtha
on
the
mountain
the
courtesan
was
afraid
of
being
understood
she
ascribed
this
dreadful
dejection
to
the
joy
with
which
she
looked
forward
to
the
function
as
there
is
certainly
as
wide
a
gulf
between
the
habits
she
had
given
up
and
the
habits
she
was
acquiring
as
there
is
between
the
savage
state
and
civilization
she
had
the
grace
and
simplicity
and
depth
which
distinguished
the
wonderful
heroine
of
the
american
puritans
she
had
too
without
knowing
it
a
love
that
was
eating
out
her
heart
a
strange
love
a
desire
more
violent
in
her
who
knew
everything
than
it
can
be
in
a
maiden
who
knows
nothing
though
the
two
forms
of
desire
have
the
same
cause
and
the
same
end
in
view
during
the
first
few
months
the
novelty
of
a
secluded
life
the
surprises
of
learning
the
handiworks
she
was
taught
the
practices
of
religion
the
fervency
of
a
holy
resolve
the
gentle
affections
she
called
forth
and
the
exercise
of
the
faculties
of
her
awakened
intelligence
all
helped
to
repress
her
memory
even
the
effort
she
made
to
acquire
a
new
one
for
she
had
as
much
to
unlearn
as
to
learn
there
is
more
than
one
form
of
memory
the
body
and
mind
have
each
their
own
for
instance
is
a
malady
of
the
physical
memory
thus
during
the
third
month
the
vehemence
of
this
virgin
soul
soaring
to
paradise
on
outspread
wings
was
not
indeed
quelled
but
fettered
by
a
dull
rebellion
of
which
esther
herself
did
not
know
the
cause
like
the
scottish
sheep
she
wanted
to
pasture
in
solitude
she
could
not
conquer
the
instincts
begotten
of
debauchery
was
it
that
the
foul
ways
of
the
paris
she
had
abjured
were
calling
her
back
to
them
did
the
chains
of
the
hideous
habits
she
had
renounced
cling
to
her
by
forgotten
rivets
and
was
she
feeling
them
as
old
soldiers
suffer
still
the
surgeons
tell
us
in
the
limbs
they
have
lost
had
vice
and
excess
so
soaked
into
her
marrow
that
holy
waters
had
not
yet
exorcised
the
devil
lurking
there
was
the
sight
of
him
for
whom
her
angelic
efforts
were
made
necessary
to
the
poor
soul
whom
god
would
surely
forgive
for
mingling
human
and
sacred
love
one
had
led
to
the
other
was
there
some
transposition
of
the
vital
force
in
her
involving
her
in
inevitable
suffering
everything
is
doubtful
and
obscure
in
a
case
which
science
scorns
to
study
regarding
the
subject
as
too
immoral
and
too
compromising
as
if
the
physician
and
the
writer
the
priest
and
the
political
student
were
not
above
all
suspicion
however
a
doctor
who
was
stopped
by
death
had
the
courage
to
begin
an
investigation
which
he
left
unfinished
perhaps
the
dark
depression
to
which
esther
fell
a
victim
and
which
cast
a
gloom
over
her
happy
life
was
due
to
all
these
causes
and
perhaps
unable
as
she
was
to
suspect
them
herself
she
suffered
as
sick
creatures
suffer
who
know
nothing
of
medicine
or
surgery
the
fact
is
strange
wholesome
and
abundant
food
in
the
place
of
bad
and
inflammatory
nourishment
did
not
sustain
esther
a
pure
and
regular
life
divided
between
recreation
and
studies
intentionally
abridged
taking
the
place
of
a
disorderly
existence
of
which
the
pleasures
and
the
pains
were
equally
horrible
exhausted
the
the
coolest
rest
the
calmest
nights
taking
the
place
of
crushing
fatigue
and
the
most
torturing
agitation
gave
her
low
fever
in
which
the
common
symptoms
were
imperceptible
to
the
nursing
sister
s
eye
or
finger
in
fact
virtue
and
happiness
following
on
evil
and
misfortune
security
in
the
stead
of
anxiety
were
as
fatal
to
esther
as
her
past
wretchedness
would
have
been
to
her
young
companions
planted
in
corruption
she
had
grown
up
in
it
that
infernal
home
still
had
a
hold
on
her
in
spite
of
the
commands
of
a
despotic
will
what
she
loathed
was
life
to
her
what
she
loved
was
killing
her
her
faith
was
so
ardent
that
her
piety
was
a
delight
to
those
about
her
she
loved
to
pray
she
had
opened
her
spirit
to
the
lights
of
true
religion
and
received
it
without
an
effort
or
a
doubt
the
priest
who
was
her
director
was
delighted
with
her
still
at
every
turn
her
body
resisted
the
spirit
to
please
a
whim
of
madame
de
maintenon
s
who
fed
them
with
scraps
from
the
royal
table
some
carp
were
taken
out
of
a
muddy
pool
and
placed
in
a
marble
basin
of
bright
clean
water
the
carp
perished
the
animals
might
be
sacrificed
but
man
could
never
infect
them
with
the
leprosy
of
flattery
a
courtier
remarked
at
versailles
on
this
mute
resistance
they
are
like
me
said
the
uncrowned
queen
they
pine
for
their
obscure
this
speech
epitomizes
esther
s
story
at
times
the
poor
girl
was
driven
to
run
about
the
splendid
convent
gardens
she
hurried
from
tree
to
tree
she
rushed
into
the
darkest
nooks
seeking
what
she
did
not
know
but
she
fell
a
prey
to
the
demon
she
carried
on
a
flirtation
with
the
trees
she
appealed
to
them
in
unspoken
words
sometimes
in
the
evening
she
stole
along
under
the
walls
like
a
snake
without
any
shawl
over
her
bare
shoulders
often
in
chapel
during
the
service
she
remained
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
crucifix
melted
to
tears
the
others
admired
her
but
she
was
crying
with
rage
instead
of
the
sacred
images
she
hoped
to
see
those
glaring
nights
when
she
had
led
some
orgy
as
habeneck
leads
a
beethoven
symphony
at
the
conservatoire
nights
of
laughter
and
lasciviousness
with
vehement
gestures
inextinguishable
laughter
rose
before
her
frenzied
furious
and
brutal
she
was
as
mild
to
look
upon
as
a
virgin
that
clings
to
earth
only
by
her
woman
s
shape
within
raged
an
imperial
messalina
she
alone
knew
the
secret
of
this
struggle
between
the
devil
and
the
angel
when
the
superior
reproved
her
for
having
done
her
hair
more
fashionably
than
the
rule
of
the
house
allowed
she
altered
it
with
prompt
and
beautiful
submission
she
would
have
cut
her
hair
off
if
the
mother
had
required
it
of
her
this
moral
was
truly
pathetic
in
a
girl
who
would
rather
have
perished
than
have
returned
to
the
depths
of
impurity
she
grew
pale
and
altered
and
thin
the
superior
gave
her
shorter
lessons
and
called
the
interesting
creature
to
her
room
to
question
her
but
esther
was
happy
she
enjoyed
the
society
of
her
companions
she
felt
no
pain
in
any
vital
part
still
it
was
vitality
itself
that
was
attacked
she
regretted
nothing
she
wanted
nothing
the
superior
puzzled
by
her
boarder
s
answers
did
not
know
what
to
think
when
she
saw
her
pining
under
consuming
debility
the
doctor
was
called
in
when
the
girl
s
condition
seemed
serious
but
this
doctor
knew
nothing
of
esther
s
previous
life
and
could
not
guess
it
he
found
every
organ
sound
the
pain
could
not
be
localized
the
invalid
s
replies
were
such
as
to
upset
every
hypothesis
there
remained
one
way
of
clearing
up
the
learned
man
s
doubts
which
now
lighted
on
a
frightful
suggestion
but
esther
obstinately
refused
to
submit
to
a
medical
examination
in
this
difficulty
the
superior
appealed
to
the
abbe
herrera
the
spaniard
came
saw
that
esther
s
condition
was
desperate
and
took
the
physician
aside
for
a
moment
after
this
confidential
interview
the
man
of
science
told
the
man
of
faith
that
the
only
cure
lay
in
a
journey
to
italy
the
abbe
would
not
hear
of
such
a
journey
before
esther
s
baptism
and
first
communion
how
long
will
it
be
till
then
asked
the
doctor
a
month
replied
the
superior
she
will
be
dead
said
the
doctor
yes
but
in
a
state
of
grace
and
salvation
said
the
abbe
in
spain
the
religious
question
is
supreme
above
all
political
civil
or
vital
considerations
so
the
physician
did
not
answer
the
spaniard
he
turned
to
the
mother
superior
but
the
terrible
abbe
took
him
by
the
arm
and
stopped
him
not
a
word
monsieur
said
he
the
doctor
though
a
religious
man
and
a
monarchist
looked
at
esther
with
an
expression
of
tender
pity
the
girl
was
as
lovely
as
a
lily
drooping
on
its
stem
god
help
her
then
he
exclaimed
as
he
went
away
on
the
very
day
of
this
consultation
esther
was
taken
by
her
protector
to
the
de
a
famous
restaurant
for
his
wish
to
save
her
had
suggested
strange
expedients
to
the
priest
he
tried
the
effect
of
two
excesses
an
excellent
dinner
which
might
remind
the
poor
child
of
past
orgies
and
the
opera
which
would
give
her
mind
some
images
of
worldliness
his
despotic
authority
was
needed
to
tempt
the
young
saint
to
such
profanation
herrera
disguised
himself
so
effectually
as
a
military
man
that
esther
hardly
recognized
him
he
took
care
to
make
his
companion
wear
a
veil
and
put
her
in
a
box
where
she
was
hidden
from
all
eyes
this
palliative
which
had
no
risks
for
innocence
so
sincerely
regained
soon
lost
its
effect
the
viewed
her
protector
s
dinners
with
disgust
had
a
religious
aversion
for
the
theatre
and
relapsed
into
melancholy
she
is
dying
of
love
for
lucien
said
herrera
to
himself
he
had
wanted
to
sound
the
depths
of
this
soul
and
know
how
much
could
be
exacted
from
it
so
the
moment
came
when
the
poor
child
was
no
longer
upheld
by
moral
force
and
the
body
was
about
to
break
down
the
priest
calculated
the
time
with
the
hideous
practical
sagacity
formerly
shown
by
executioners
in
the
art
of
torture
he
found
his
protegee
in
the
garden
sitting
on
a
bench
under
a
trellis
on
which
the
april
sun
fell
gently
she
seemed
to
be
cold
and
trying
to
warm
herself
her
companions
looked
with
interest
at
her
pallor
as
of
a
folded
plant
her
eyes
like
those
of
a
dying
gazelle
her
drooping
attitude
esther
rose
and
went
to
meet
the
spaniard
with
a
lassitude
that
showed
how
little
life
there
was
in
her
and
it
may
be
added
how
little
care
to
live
this
hapless
outcast
this
wild
and
wounded
swallow
moved
carlos
herrera
to
compassion
for
the
second
time
the
gloomy
minister
whom
god
should
have
employed
only
to
carry
out
his
revenges
received
the
sick
girl
with
a
smile
which
expressed
indeed
as
much
bitterness
as
sweetness
as
much
vengeance
as
charity
esther
practised
in
meditation
and
used
to
revulsions
of
feeling
since
she
had
led
this
almost
monastic
life
felt
on
her
part
for
the
second
time
distrust
of
her
protector
but
as
on
the
former
occasion
his
speech
reassured
her
well
my
dear
child
said
he
and
why
have
you
never
spoken
to
me
of
lucien
i
promised
you
she
said
shuddering
convulsively
from
head
to
foot
i
swore
to
you
that
i
would
never
breathe
his
and
yet
you
have
not
ceased
to
think
of
that
monsieur
is
the
only
fault
i
have
committed
i
think
of
him
always
and
just
as
you
came
i
was
saying
his
name
to
absence
is
killing
you
esther
s
only
answer
was
to
hang
her
head
as
the
sick
do
who
already
scent
the
breath
of
the
grave
if
you
could
see
him
said
he
it
would
be
life
she
cried
and
do
you
think
of
him
only
spiritually
ah
monsieur
love
can
not
be
dissected
child
of
an
accursed
race
i
have
done
everything
to
save
you
i
send
you
back
to
your
you
shall
see
him
why
insult
my
happiness
can
i
not
love
lucien
and
be
virtuous
am
i
not
ready
to
die
here
for
virtue
as
i
should
be
ready
to
die
for
him
am
i
not
dying
for
these
two
fanaticisms
for
virtue
which
was
to
make
me
worthy
of
him
and
for
him
who
flung
me
into
the
embrace
of
virtue
yes
and
ready
to
die
without
seeing
him
or
to
live
by
seeing
him
god
is
my
the
color
had
mounted
to
her
face
her
whiteness
had
recovered
its
amber
warmth
esther
looked
beautiful
again
the
day
after
that
on
which
you
are
washed
in
the
waters
of
baptism
you
shall
see
lucien
once
more
and
if
you
think
you
can
live
in
virtue
by
living
for
him
you
shall
part
no
the
priest
was
obliged
to
lift
up
esther
whose
knees
failed
her
the
poor
child
dropped
as
if
the
ground
had
slipped
from
under
her
feet
the
abbe
seated
her
on
a
bench
and
when
she
could
speak
again
she
asked
him
why
not
do
you
want
to
rob
monseigneur
of
the
triumph
of
your
baptism
and
conversion
you
are
too
close
to
lucien
not
to
be
far
from
yes
i
was
not
thinking
you
will
never
be
of
any
religion
said
the
priest
with
a
touch
of
the
deepest
irony
god
is
good
said
she
he
can
read
my
conquered
by
the
exquisite
artlessness
and
gestures
herrera
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
for
the
first
time
your
libertine
friends
named
you
well
you
would
bewitch
god
the
a
few
days
more
must
pass
and
then
you
will
both
be
both
she
echoed
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
this
scene
observed
from
a
distance
struck
pupils
and
superiors
alike
they
fancied
they
had
looked
on
at
a
miracle
as
they
compared
esther
with
herself
she
was
completely
changed
she
was
alive
she
reappeared
her
natural
self
all
love
sweet
coquettish
playful
and
gay
in
short
it
was
a
resurrection
herrera
lived
in
the
rue
cassette
near
the
church
to
which
he
was
attached
this
building
hard
and
stern
in
style
suited
this
spaniard
whose
discipline
was
that
of
the
dominicans
a
lost
son
of
ferdinand
s
astute
policy
he
devoted
himself
to
the
cause
of
the
constitution
knowing
that
this
devotion
could
never
be
rewarded
till
the
restoration
of
the
carlos
herrera
had
thrown
himself
body
and
soul
into
the
at
the
moment
when
the
cortes
seemed
likely
to
stand
and
hold
their
own
to
the
world
this
conduct
seemed
to
proclaim
a
superior
soul
the
duc
d
angouleme
s
expedition
had
been
carried
out
king
ferdinand
was
on
the
throne
and
carlos
herrera
did
not
go
to
claim
the
reward
of
his
services
at
madrid
fortified
against
curiosity
by
his
diplomatic
taciturnity
he
assigned
as
his
reason
for
remaining
in
paris
his
strong
affection
for
lucien
de
rubempre
to
which
the
young
man
already
owed
the
king
s
patent
relating
to
his
change
of
name
herrera
lived
very
obscurely
as
priests
employed
on
secret
missions
traditionally
live
he
fulfilled
his
religious
duties
at
never
went
out
but
on
business
and
then
after
dark
and
in
a
hackney
cab
his
day
was
filled
up
with
a
siesta
in
the
spanish
fashion
which
arranges
for
sleep
between
the
two
chief
meals
and
so
occupies
the
hours
when
paris
is
in
a
busy
turmoil
the
spanish
cigar
also
played
its
part
and
consumed
time
as
well
as
tobacco
laziness
is
a
mask
as
gravity
is
and
that
again
is
laziness
herrera
lived
on
the
second
floor
in
one
wing
of
the
house
and
lucien
occupied
the
other
wing
the
two
apartments
were
separated
and
joined
by
a
large
reception
room
of
antique
magnificence
suitable
equally
to
the
grave
priest
and
to
the
young
poet
the
courtyard
was
gloomy
large
thick
trees
shaded
the
garden
silence
and
reserve
are
always
found
in
the
dwellings
chosen
by
priests
herrera
s
lodging
may
be
described
in
one
word
a
cell
lucien
s
splendid
with
luxury
and
furnished
with
every
refinement
of
comfort
combined
everything
that
the
elegant
life
of
a
dandy
demands
a
poet
a
writer
ambitious
and
dissipated
at
once
vain
and
vainglorious
utterly
heedless
and
yet
wishing
for
order
one
of
those
incomplete
geniuses
who
have
some
power
to
wish
to
conceive
which
is
perhaps
the
same
thing
but
no
power
at
all
to
execute
these
two
lucien
and
herrera
formed
a
body
politic
this
no
doubt
was
the
secret
of
their
union
old
men
in
whom
the
activities
of
life
have
been
uprooted
and
transplanted
to
the
sphere
of
interest
often
feel
the
need
of
a
pleasing
instrument
a
young
and
impassioned
actor
to
carry
out
their
schemes
richelieu
too
late
found
a
handsome
pale
face
with
a
young
moustache
to
cast
in
the
way
of
women
whom
he
wanted
to
amuse
misunderstood
by
younger
men
he
was
compelled
to
banish
his
master
s
mother
and
terrify
the
queen
after
having
tried
to
make
each
fall
in
love
with
him
though
he
was
not
cut
out
to
be
loved
by
queens
do
what
we
will
always
in
the
course
of
an
ambitious
life
we
find
a
woman
in
the
way
just
when
we
least
expect
such
an
obstacle
however
great
a
political
man
may
be
he
always
needs
a
woman
to
set
against
a
woman
just
as
the
dutch
use
a
diamond
to
cut
a
diamond
rome
at
the
height
of
its
power
yielded
to
this
necessity
and
observe
how
immeasurably
more
imposing
was
the
life
of
mazarin
the
italian
cardinal
than
that
of
richelieu
the
french
cardinal
richelieu
met
with
opposition
from
the
great
nobles
and
he
applied
the
axe
he
died
in
the
flower
of
his
success
worn
out
by
this
duel
for
which
he
had
only
a
capuchin
monk
as
his
second
mazarin
was
repulsed
by
the
citizen
class
and
the
nobility
armed
allies
who
sometimes
victoriously
put
royalty
to
flight
but
anne
of
austria
s
devoted
servant
took
off
no
heads
he
succeeded
in
vanquishing
the
whole
of
france
and
trained
louis
who
completed
richelieu
s
work
by
strangling
the
nobility
with
gilded
cords
in
the
grand
seraglio
of
versailles
madame
de
pompadour
dead
choiseul
fell
had
herrera
soaked
his
mind
in
these
high
doctrines
had
he
judged
himself
at
an
earlier
age
than
richelieu
had
he
chosen
lucien
to
be
his
but
a
faithful
no
one
could
answer
these
questions
or
measure
this
spaniard
s
ambition
as
no
one
could
foresee
what
his
end
might
be
these
questions
asked
by
those
who
were
able
to
see
anything
of
this
coalition
which
was
long
kept
a
secret
might
have
unveiled
a
horrible
mystery
which
lucien
himself
had
known
but
a
few
days
carlos
was
ambitious
for
two
that
was
what
his
conduct
made
plain
to
those
persons
who
knew
him
and
who
all
imagined
that
lucien
was
the
priest
s
illegitimate
son
fifteen
months
after
lucien
s
reappearance
at
the
opera
ball
which
led
him
too
soon
into
a
world
where
the
priest
had
not
wished
to
see
him
till
he
should
have
fully
armed
him
against
it
he
had
three
fine
horses
in
his
stable
a
coupe
for
evening
use
a
cab
and
a
tilbury
to
drive
by
day
he
dined
out
every
day
herrera
s
foresight
was
justified
his
pupil
was
carried
away
by
dissipation
he
thought
it
necessary
to
effect
some
diversion
in
the
frenzied
passion
for
esther
that
the
young
man
still
cherished
in
his
heart
after
spending
something
like
forty
thousand
francs
every
folly
had
brought
lucien
back
with
increased
eagerness
to
la
torpille
he
searched
for
her
persistently
and
as
he
could
not
find
her
she
became
to
him
what
game
is
to
the
sportsman
could
herrera
understand
the
nature
of
a
poet
s
love
when
once
this
feeling
has
mounted
to
the
brain
of
one
of
these
great
little
men
after
firing
his
heart
and
absorbing
his
senses
the
poet
becomes
as
far
superior
to
humanity
through
love
as
he
already
is
through
the
power
of
his
imagination
a
freak
of
intellectual
heredity
has
given
him
the
faculty
of
expressing
nature
by
imagery
to
which
he
gives
the
stamp
both
of
sentiment
and
of
thought
and
he
lends
his
love
the
wings
of
his
spirit
he
feels
and
he
paints
he
acts
and
meditates
he
multiplies
his
sensations
by
thought
present
felicity
becomes
threefold
through
aspiration
for
the
future
and
memory
of
the
past
and
with
it
he
mingles
the
exquisite
delights
of
the
soul
which
makes
him
the
prince
of
artists
then
the
poet
s
passion
becomes
a
fine
poem
in
which
human
proportion
is
often
set
at
nought
does
not
the
poet
then
place
his
mistress
far
higher
than
women
crave
to
sit
like
the
sublime
knight
of
la
mancha
he
transfigures
a
peasant
girl
to
be
a
princess
he
uses
for
his
own
behoof
the
wand
with
which
he
touches
everything
turning
it
into
a
wonder
and
thus
enhances
the
pleasure
of
loving
by
the
glorious
glamour
of
the
ideal
such
a
love
is
the
very
essence
of
passion
it
is
extreme
in
all
things
in
its
hopes
in
its
despair
in
its
rage
in
its
melancholy
in
its
joy
it
flies
it
leaps
it
crawls
it
is
not
like
any
of
the
emotions
known
to
ordinary
men
it
is
to
everyday
love
what
the
perennial
alpine
torrent
is
to
the
lowland
brook
these
splendid
geniuses
are
so
rarely
understood
that
they
spend
themselves
in
hopes
deceived
they
are
exhausted
by
the
search
for
their
ideal
mistress
and
almost
always
die
like
gorgeous
insects
splendidly
adorned
for
their
by
the
most
poetical
of
nature
s
inventions
and
crushed
under
the
foot
of
a
but
there
is
another
danger
when
they
meet
with
the
form
that
answers
to
their
soul
and
which
not
unfrequently
is
that
of
a
baker
s
wife
they
do
as
raphael
did
as
the
beautiful
insect
does
they
die
in
the
fornarina
s
arms
lucien
was
at
this
pass
his
poetical
temperament
excessive
in
all
things
in
good
as
in
evil
had
discerned
the
angel
in
this
girl
who
was
tainted
by
corruption
rather
than
corrupt
he
always
saw
her
white
winged
pure
and
mysterious
as
she
had
made
herself
for
him
understanding
that
he
would
have
her
so
towards
the
end
of
the
month
of
may
lucien
had
lost
all
his
good
spirits
he
never
went
out
dined
with
herrera
sat
pensive
worked
read
volumes
of
diplomatic
treatises
squatted
on
a
divan
and
smoked
three
or
four
hookahs
a
day
his
groom
had
more
to
do
in
cleaning
and
perfuming
the
tubes
of
this
noble
pipe
than
in
currying
and
brushing
down
the
horses
coats
and
dressing
them
with
cockades
for
driving
in
the
bois
as
soon
as
the
spaniard
saw
lucien
pale
and
detected
a
malady
in
the
frenzy
of
suppressed
passion
he
determined
to
read
to
the
bottom
of
this
man
s
heart
on
which
he
founded
his
life
one
fine
evening
when
lucien
lounging
in
an
armchair
was
mechanically
contemplating
the
hues
of
the
setting
sun
through
the
trees
in
the
garden
blowing
up
the
mist
of
scented
smoke
in
slow
regular
clouds
as
pensive
smokers
are
wont
he
was
roused
from
his
reverie
by
hearing
a
deep
sigh
he
turned
and
saw
the
abbe
standing
by
him
with
folded
arms
you
were
there
said
the
poet
for
some
time
said
the
priest
my
thoughts
have
been
following
the
wide
sweep
of
lucien
understood
his
meaning
i
have
never
affected
to
have
an
iron
nature
such
as
yours
is
to
me
life
is
by
turns
paradise
and
hell
when
by
chance
it
is
neither
it
bores
me
and
i
am
bored
how
can
you
be
bored
when
you
have
such
splendid
prospects
before
you
if
i
have
no
faith
in
those
prospects
or
if
they
are
too
much
shrouded
do
not
talk
nonsense
said
the
priest
it
would
be
far
more
worthy
of
you
and
of
me
that
you
should
open
your
heart
to
me
there
is
now
that
between
us
which
ought
never
to
have
come
between
us
a
secret
this
secret
has
subsisted
for
sixteen
months
you
are
in
and
what
then
a
foul
hussy
called
la
torpille
well
my
boy
i
told
you
you
might
have
a
mistress
but
a
woman
of
rank
pretty
young
influential
a
countess
at
least
i
had
chosen
madame
d
espard
for
you
to
make
her
the
instrument
of
your
fortune
without
scruple
for
she
would
never
have
perverted
your
heart
she
would
have
left
you
to
love
a
prostitute
of
the
lowest
class
when
you
have
not
like
kings
the
power
to
give
her
high
rank
is
a
monstrous
and
am
i
the
first
man
who
had
renounced
ambition
to
follow
the
lead
of
a
boundless
passion
good
said
the
priest
stooping
to
pick
up
the
mouthpiece
of
the
hookah
which
lucien
had
dropped
on
the
floor
i
understand
the
retort
can
not
love
and
ambition
be
reconciled
child
you
have
a
mother
in
old
herrera
a
mother
who
is
wholly
devoted
to
you
i
know
it
old
friend
said
lucien
taking
his
hand
and
shaking
it
you
wished
for
the
toys
of
wealth
you
have
them
you
want
to
shine
i
am
guiding
you
into
the
paths
of
power
i
kiss
very
dirty
hands
to
secure
your
advancement
and
you
will
get
on
a
little
while
yet
and
you
will
lack
nothing
of
what
can
charm
man
or
woman
though
effeminate
in
your
caprices
your
intellect
is
manly
i
have
dreamed
all
things
of
you
i
forgive
you
all
you
have
only
to
speak
to
have
your
ephemeral
passions
gratified
i
have
aggrandized
your
life
by
introducing
into
it
that
which
makes
it
delightful
to
most
people
the
stamp
of
political
influence
and
dominion
you
will
be
as
great
as
you
now
are
small
but
you
must
not
break
the
machine
by
which
we
coin
money
i
grant
you
all
you
will
excepting
such
blunders
as
will
destroy
your
future
prospects
when
i
can
open
the
of
the
faubourg
to
you
i
forbid
your
wallowing
in
the
gutter
lucien
i
mean
to
be
an
iron
stanchion
in
your
interest
i
will
endure
everything
from
you
for
you
thus
i
have
transformed
your
lack
of
tact
in
the
game
of
life
into
the
shrewd
stroke
of
a
skilful
player
lucien
looked
up
with
a
start
of
furious
impetuosity
i
carried
off
la
torpille
you
cried
lucien
in
a
fit
of
animal
rage
the
poet
jumped
up
flung
the
jeweled
mouthpiece
in
the
priest
s
face
and
pushed
him
with
such
violence
as
to
throw
down
that
strong
man
i
said
the
spaniard
getting
up
and
preserving
his
terrible
gravity
his
black
wig
had
fallen
off
a
bald
skull
as
shining
as
a
death
s
head
showed
the
man
s
real
countenance
it
was
appalling
lucien
sat
on
his
divan
his
hands
hanging
limp
overpowered
and
gazing
at
the
abbe
with
stupefaction
i
carried
her
off
the
priest
repeated
what
did
you
do
with
her
you
took
her
away
the
day
after
the
opera
yes
the
day
after
i
had
seen
a
woman
who
belonged
to
you
insulted
by
wretches
whom
i
would
not
have
condescended
to
kick
wretches
interrupted
lucien
say
rather
monsters
compared
with
whom
those
who
are
guillotined
are
angels
do
you
know
what
the
unhappy
torpille
had
done
for
three
of
them
one
of
them
was
her
lover
for
two
months
she
was
poor
and
picked
up
a
living
in
the
gutter
he
had
not
a
sou
like
me
when
you
rescued
me
he
was
very
near
the
river
this
fellow
would
get
up
at
night
and
go
to
the
cupboard
where
the
girl
kept
the
remains
of
her
dinner
and
eat
it
at
last
she
discovered
the
trick
she
understood
the
shameful
thing
and
took
care
to
leave
a
great
deal
then
she
was
happy
she
never
told
any
one
but
me
that
night
coming
home
from
the
opera
the
second
had
stolen
some
money
but
before
the
theft
was
found
out
she
lent
him
the
sum
which
he
was
enabled
to
replace
and
which
he
always
forgot
to
repay
to
the
poor
child
as
to
the
third
she
made
his
fortune
by
playing
out
a
farce
worthy
of
figaro
s
genius
she
passed
as
his
wife
and
became
the
mistress
of
a
man
in
power
who
believed
her
to
be
the
most
innocent
of
good
citizens
to
one
she
gave
life
to
another
honor
to
the
third
fortune
what
does
it
all
count
for
and
this
is
how
they
reward
her
would
you
like
to
see
them
dead
said
herrera
in
whose
eyes
there
were
tears
come
that
is
just
like
you
i
know
you
by
that
nay
hear
all
raving
poet
said
the
priest
la
torpille
is
no
lucien
flew
at
herrera
to
seize
him
by
the
throat
with
such
violence
that
any
other
man
must
have
fallen
backwards
but
the
spaniard
s
arm
held
off
his
assailant
come
listen
said
he
coldly
i
have
made
another
woman
of
her
chaste
pure
well
bred
religious
a
perfect
lady
she
is
being
educated
she
can
if
she
may
under
the
influence
of
your
love
become
a
ninon
a
marion
delorme
a
du
barry
as
the
journalist
at
the
opera
ball
remarked
you
may
proclaim
her
your
mistress
or
you
may
retire
behind
a
curtain
of
your
own
creating
which
will
be
wiser
by
either
method
you
will
gain
profit
and
pride
pleasure
and
advancement
but
if
you
are
as
great
a
politician
as
you
are
a
poet
esther
will
be
no
more
to
you
than
any
other
woman
of
the
town
for
later
perhaps
she
may
help
us
out
of
difficulties
she
is
worth
her
weight
in
gold
drink
but
do
not
get
tipsy
if
i
had
not
held
the
reins
of
your
passion
where
would
you
be
now
rolling
with
la
torpille
in
the
slough
of
misery
from
which
i
dragged
you
here
read
this
said
herrera
as
simply
as
talma
in
which
he
had
never
seen
a
sheet
of
paper
was
laid
on
the
poet
s
knees
and
startled
him
from
the
ecstasy
and
surprise
with
which
he
had
listened
to
this
astounding
speech
he
took
it
and
read
the
first
letter
written
by
mademoiselle
esther
to
monsieur
l
abbe
carlos
herrera
my
dear
protector
will
you
not
suppose
that
gratitude
is
stronger
in
me
than
love
when
you
see
that
the
first
use
i
make
of
the
power
of
expressing
my
thoughts
is
to
thank
you
instead
of
devoting
it
to
pouring
forth
a
passion
that
lucien
has
perhaps
forgotten
but
to
you
divine
man
i
can
say
what
i
should
not
dare
to
tell
him
who
to
my
joy
still
clings
to
earth
yesterday
s
ceremony
has
filled
me
with
treasures
of
grace
and
i
place
my
fate
in
your
hands
even
if
i
must
die
far
away
from
my
beloved
i
shall
die
purified
like
the
magdalen
and
my
soul
will
become
to
him
the
rival
of
his
guardian
angel
can
i
ever
forget
yesterday
s
festival
how
could
i
wish
to
abdicate
the
glorious
throne
to
which
i
was
raised
yesterday
i
washed
away
every
stain
in
the
waters
of
baptism
and
received
the
sacred
body
of
my
redeemer
i
am
become
one
of
his
tabernacles
at
that
moment
i
heard
the
songs
of
angels
i
was
more
than
a
woman
born
to
a
life
of
light
amid
the
acclamations
of
the
whole
earth
admired
by
the
world
in
a
cloud
of
incense
and
prayers
that
were
intoxicating
adorned
like
a
virgin
for
the
heavenly
spouse
thus
finding
myself
worthy
of
lucien
which
i
had
never
hoped
to
be
i
abjured
impure
love
and
vowed
to
walk
only
in
the
paths
of
virtue
if
my
flesh
is
weaker
than
my
spirit
let
it
perish
be
the
arbiter
of
my
destiny
and
if
i
die
tell
lucien
that
i
died
to
him
when
i
was
born
to
lucien
looked
up
at
the
abbe
with
eyes
full
of
tears
you
know
the
rooms
fat
caroline
bellefeuille
had
in
the
rue
taitbout
the
spaniard
said
the
poor
creature
cast
off
by
her
magistrate
was
in
the
greatest
poverty
she
was
about
to
be
sold
up
i
bought
the
place
all
standing
and
she
turned
out
with
her
clothes
esther
the
angel
who
aspired
to
heaven
has
alighted
there
and
is
waiting
for
at
this
moment
lucien
heard
his
horses
pawing
the
ground
in
the
courtyard
he
was
incapable
of
expressing
his
admiration
for
a
devotion
which
he
alone
could
appreciate
he
threw
himself
into
the
arms
of
the
man
he
had
insulted
made
amends
for
all
by
a
look
and
the
speechless
effusion
of
his
feelings
then
he
flew
downstairs
confided
esther
s
address
to
his
tiger
s
ear
and
the
horses
went
off
as
if
their
master
s
passion
had
lived
in
their
legs
the
next
day
a
man
who
by
his
dress
might
have
been
mistaken
by
the
for
a
gendarme
in
disguise
was
passing
the
rue
taitbout
opposite
a
house
as
if
he
were
waiting
for
some
one
to
come
out
he
walked
with
an
agitated
air
you
will
often
see
in
paris
such
vehement
promenaders
real
gendarmes
watching
a
recalcitrant
national
guardsman
bailiffs
taking
steps
to
effect
an
arrest
creditors
planning
a
trick
on
the
debtor
who
has
shut
himself
in
lovers
or
jealous
and
suspicious
husbands
or
friends
doing
sentry
for
a
friend
but
rarely
do
you
meet
a
face
portending
such
coarse
and
fierce
thoughts
as
animated
that
of
the
gloomy
and
powerful
man
who
paced
to
and
fro
under
mademoiselle
esther
s
windows
with
the
brooding
haste
of
a
bear
in
its
cage
at
noon
a
window
was
opened
and
a
s
hand
was
put
out
to
push
back
the
padded
shutters
a
few
minutes
later
esther
in
her
came
to
breathe
the
air
leaning
on
lucien
any
one
who
saw
them
might
have
taken
them
for
the
originals
of
some
pretty
english
vignette
esther
was
the
first
to
recognize
the
basilisk
eyes
of
the
spanish
priest
and
the
poor
creature
stricken
as
if
she
had
been
shot
gave
a
cry
of
horror
there
is
that
terrible
priest
said
she
pointing
him
out
to
lucien
he
said
lucien
smiling
he
is
no
more
a
priest
than
you
what
then
she
said
in
alarm
why
an
old
villain
who
believes
in
nothing
but
the
devil
said
lucien
this
light
thrown
on
the
sham
priest
s
secrets
if
revealed
to
any
one
less
devoted
than
esther
might
have
ruined
lucien
for
ever
as
they
went
along
the
corridor
from
their
bedroom
to
the
where
their
breakfast
was
served
the
lovers
met
carlos
herrera
what
have
you
come
here
for
said
lucien
roughly
to
bless
you
replied
the
audacious
scoundrel
stopping
the
pair
and
detaining
them
in
the
little
of
the
apartment
listen
to
me
my
pretty
dears
amuse
yourselves
be
happy
well
and
good
happiness
at
any
price
is
my
but
you
he
went
on
to
esther
you
whom
i
dragged
from
the
mud
and
have
soaped
down
body
and
soul
you
surely
do
not
dream
that
you
can
stand
in
lucien
s
way
as
for
you
my
boy
he
went
on
after
a
pause
looking
at
lucien
you
are
no
longer
poet
enough
to
allow
yourself
another
coralie
this
is
sober
prose
what
can
be
done
with
esther
s
lover
nothing
can
esther
become
madame
de
rubempre
no
well
my
child
said
he
laying
his
hand
on
esther
s
and
making
her
shiver
as
if
some
serpent
had
wound
itself
round
her
the
world
must
never
know
of
your
existence
above
all
the
world
must
never
know
that
a
certain
mademoiselle
esther
loves
lucien
and
that
lucien
is
in
love
with
these
rooms
are
your
prison
my
pigeon
if
you
wish
to
go
out
and
your
health
will
require
it
you
must
take
exercise
at
night
at
hours
when
you
can
not
be
seen
for
your
youth
and
beauty
and
the
style
you
have
acquired
at
the
convent
would
at
once
be
observed
in
paris
the
day
when
any
one
in
the
world
whoever
it
be
he
added
in
an
awful
voice
seconded
by
an
awful
look
learns
that
lucien
is
your
lover
or
that
you
are
his
mistress
that
day
will
be
your
last
but
one
on
earth
i
have
procured
that
boy
a
patent
permitting
him
to
bear
the
name
and
arms
of
his
maternal
ancestors
still
this
is
not
all
we
have
not
yet
recovered
the
title
of
marquis
and
to
get
it
he
must
marry
a
girl
of
good
family
in
whose
favor
the
king
will
grant
this
distinction
such
an
alliance
will
get
lucien
on
in
the
world
and
at
court
this
boy
of
whom
i
have
made
a
man
will
be
first
secretary
to
an
embassy
later
he
shall
be
minister
at
some
german
court
and
god
or
i
better
still
helping
him
he
will
take
his
seat
some
day
on
the
bench
reserved
for
peers
or
on
the
bench
reserved
for
lucien
began
interrupting
the
man
hold
your
tongue
cried
carlos
laying
his
broad
hand
on
lucien
s
mouth
would
you
tell
such
a
secret
to
a
woman
he
muttered
in
his
ear
esther
a
woman
cried
the
poet
of
still
inditing
sonnets
said
the
spaniard
nonsense
sooner
or
later
all
these
angels
relapse
into
being
women
and
every
woman
at
moments
is
a
mixture
of
a
monkey
and
a
child
two
creatures
who
can
kill
us
for
esther
my
jewel
said
he
to
the
terrified
girl
i
have
secured
as
your
a
creature
who
is
as
much
mine
as
if
she
were
my
daughter
for
your
cook
you
shall
have
a
mulatto
woman
which
gives
style
to
a
house
with
europe
and
asie
you
can
live
here
for
a
note
a
month
like
a
queen
a
stage
queen
europe
has
been
a
dressmaker
a
milliner
and
a
stage
super
asie
has
cooked
for
an
epicure
milord
these
two
women
will
serve
you
like
two
seeing
lucien
go
completely
to
the
wall
before
this
man
who
was
guilty
at
least
of
sacrilege
and
forgery
this
woman
sanctified
by
her
love
felt
an
awful
fear
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
she
made
no
reply
but
dragged
lucien
into
her
room
and
asked
him
is
he
the
devil
he
is
far
worse
to
me
he
vehemently
replied
but
if
you
love
me
try
to
imitate
that
man
s
devotion
to
me
and
obey
him
on
pain
of
death
of
death
she
exclaimed
more
frightened
than
ever
of
death
repeated
lucien
alas
my
darling
no
death
could
be
compared
with
that
which
would
befall
me
if
esther
turned
pale
at
his
words
and
felt
herself
fainting
well
well
cried
the
sacrilegious
forger
have
you
not
yet
spelt
out
your
esther
and
lucien
came
out
and
the
poor
girl
not
daring
to
look
at
the
mysterious
man
said
you
shall
be
obeyed
as
god
is
obeyed
good
said
he
you
may
be
very
happy
for
a
time
and
you
will
need
only
nightgowns
and
wrappers
that
will
be
very
the
two
lovers
went
on
towards
the
but
lucien
s
patron
signed
to
the
pretty
pair
to
stop
and
they
stopped
i
have
just
been
talking
of
your
servants
my
child
said
he
to
esther
i
must
introduce
them
to
the
spaniard
rang
twice
the
women
he
had
called
europe
and
asie
came
in
and
it
was
at
once
easy
to
see
the
reason
of
these
names
asie
who
looked
as
if
she
might
have
been
born
in
the
island
of
java
showed
a
face
to
scare
the
eye
as
flat
as
a
board
with
the
copper
complexion
peculiar
to
malays
with
a
nose
that
looked
as
if
it
had
been
driven
inwards
by
some
violent
pressure
the
strange
conformation
of
the
maxillary
bones
gave
the
lower
part
of
this
face
a
resemblance
to
that
of
the
larger
species
of
apes
the
brow
though
sloping
was
not
deficient
in
intelligence
produced
by
habits
of
cunning
two
fierce
little
eyes
had
the
calm
fixity
of
a
tiger
s
but
they
never
looked
you
straight
in
the
face
asie
seemed
afraid
lest
she
might
terrify
people
her
lips
a
dull
blue
were
parted
over
prominent
teeth
of
dazzling
whiteness
but
grown
across
the
leading
expression
of
this
animal
countenance
was
one
of
meanness
her
black
hair
straight
and
like
her
skin
lay
in
two
shining
bands
forming
an
edge
to
a
very
handsome
silk
handkerchief
her
ears
were
remarkably
pretty
and
graced
with
two
large
dark
pearls
small
short
and
squat
asie
bore
a
likeness
to
the
grotesque
figures
the
chinese
love
to
paint
on
screens
or
more
exactly
to
the
hindoo
idols
which
seem
to
be
imitated
from
some
type
found
nevertheless
now
and
again
by
travelers
esther
shuddered
as
she
looked
at
this
monstrosity
dressed
out
in
a
white
apron
over
a
stuff
gown
asie
said
the
spaniard
to
whom
the
woman
looked
up
with
a
gesture
that
can
only
be
compared
to
that
of
a
dog
to
its
master
this
is
your
and
he
pointed
to
esther
in
her
wrapper
asie
looked
at
the
young
fairy
with
an
almost
distressful
expression
but
at
the
same
moment
a
flash
half
hidden
between
her
thick
short
eyelashes
shot
like
an
incendiary
spark
at
lucien
who
in
a

curls

a
godlike
appearance
italian
genius
could
invent
the
tale
of
othello
english
genius
could
put
it
on
the
stage
but
nature
alone
reserves
the
power
of
throwing
into
a
single
glance
an
expression
of
jealousy
grander
and
more
complete
than
england
and
italy
together
could
imagine
this
look
seen
by
esther
made
her
clutch
the
spaniard
by
the
arm
setting
her
nails
in
it
as
a
cat
sets
its
claws
to
save
itself
from
falling
into
a
gulf
of
which
it
can
not
see
the
bottom
the
spaniard
spoke
a
few
words
in
some
unfamiliar
tongue
to
the
asiatic
monster
who
crept
on
her
knees
to
esther
s
feet
and
kissed
them
she
is
not
merely
a
good
cook
said
herrera
to
esther
she
is
a
and
might
make
careme
mad
with
jealousy
asie
can
do
everything
by
way
of
cooking
she
will
turn
you
out
a
simple
dish
of
beans
that
will
make
you
wonder
whether
the
angels
have
not
come
down
to
add
some
herb
from
heaven
she
will
go
to
market
herself
every
morning
and
fight
like
the
devil
she
is
to
get
things
at
the
lowest
prices
she
will
tire
out
curiosity
by
silence
you
are
to
be
supposed
to
have
been
in
india
and
asie
will
help
you
to
give
effect
to
this
fiction
for
she
is
one
of
those
parisians
who
are
born
to
be
of
any
nationality
they
please
but
i
do
not
advise
that
you
should
give
yourself
out
to
be
a
europe
what
do
you
say
europe
was
a
perfect
contrast
to
asie
for
she
was
the
smartest
that
monrose
could
have
hoped
to
see
as
her
rival
on
the
stage
slight
with
a
manner
a
face
like
a
weasel
and
a
sharp
nose
europe
s
features
offered
to
the
observer
a
countenance
worn
by
the
corruption
of
paris
life
the
unhealthy
complexion
of
a
girl
fed
on
raw
apples
lymphatic
but
sinewy
soft
but
tenacious
one
little
foot
was
set
forward
her
hands
were
in
her
and
she
fidgeted
incessantly
without
moving
from
sheer
excess
of
liveliness
grisette
and
stage
super
in
spite
of
her
youth
she
must
have
tried
many
trades
as
full
of
evil
as
a
dozen
madelonnettes
put
together
she
might
have
robbed
her
parents
and
sat
on
the
bench
of
a
asie
was
terrifying
but
you
knew
her
thoroughly
from
the
first
she
descended
in
a
straight
line
from
locusta
while
europe
filled
you
with
uneasiness
which
could
not
fail
to
increase
the
more
you
had
to
do
with
her
her
corruption
seemed
boundless
you
felt
that
she
could
set
the
devils
by
the
ears
madame
might
say
she
had
come
from
valenciennes
said
europe
in
a
precise
little
voice
i
was
born
there
perhaps
monsieur
she
added
to
lucien
in
a
pedantic
tone
will
be
good
enough
to
say
what
name
he
proposes
to
give
to
madame
madame
van
bogseck
the
spaniard
put
in
reversing
esther
s
name
madame
is
a
jewess
a
native
of
holland
the
widow
of
a
merchant
and
suffering
from
a
contracted
in
java
no
great
fortune
not
to
excite
enough
to
live
on
six
thousand
francs
a
year
and
we
shall
complain
of
her
stinginess
said
europe
that
is
the
thing
said
the
spaniard
with
a
bow
you
limbs
of
satan
he
went
on
catching
asie
and
europe
exchanging
a
glance
that
displeased
him
remember
what
i
have
told
you
you
are
serving
a
queen
you
owe
her
as
much
respect
as
to
a
queen
you
are
to
cherish
her
as
you
would
cherish
a
revenge
and
be
as
devoted
to
her
as
to
me
neither
the
nor
the
neighbors
nor
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
house
in
short
not
a
soul
on
earth
is
to
know
what
goes
on
here
it
is
your
business
to
balk
curiosity
if
any
should
be
and
madame
he
went
on
laying
his
broad
hairy
hand
on
esther
s
arm
madame
must
not
commit
the
smallest
imprudence
you
must
prevent
it
in
case
of
need
but
always
with
perfect
respect
you
europe
are
to
go
out
for
madame
in
anything
that
concerns
her
dress
and
you
must
do
her
sewing
from
motives
of
economy
finally
nobody
not
even
the
most
insignificant
creature
is
ever
to
set
foot
in
this
apartment
you
two
between
you
must
do
all
there
is
to
be
done
and
you
my
beauty
he
went
on
speaking
to
esther
when
you
want
to
go
out
in
your
carriage
by
night
you
can
tell
europe
she
will
know
where
to
find
your
men
for
you
will
have
a
servant
in
livery
of
my
choosing
like
those
two
esther
and
lucien
had
not
a
word
ready
they
listened
to
the
spaniard
and
looked
at
the
two
precious
specimens
to
whom
he
gave
his
orders
what
was
the
secret
hold
to
which
he
owed
the
submission
and
servitude
that
were
written
on
these
two
faces
one
mischievously
recalcitrant
the
other
so
malignantly
cruel
he
read
the
thoughts
of
lucien
and
esther
who
seemed
paralyzed
as
paul
and
virginia
might
have
been
at
the
sight
of
two
dreadful
snakes
and
he
said
in
a
undertone
you
can
trust
them
as
you
can
me
keep
no
secrets
from
them
that
will
flatter
go
to
your
work
my
little
asie
he
added
to
the
and
you
my
girl
lay
another
place
he
said
to
europe
the
children
can
not
do
less
than
ask
papa
to
when
the
two
women
had
shut
the
door
and
the
spaniard
could
hear
europe
moving
to
and
fro
he
turned
to
lucien
and
esther
and
opening
a
wide
palm
he
said
i
hold
them
in
the
hollow
of
my
the
words
and
gesture
made
his
hearers
shudder
where
did
you
pick
them
up
cried
lucien
what
the
devil
i
did
not
look
for
them
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
replied
the
man
europe
has
risen
from
the
mire
and
is
afraid
of
sinking
into
it
again
threaten
them
with
monsieur
abbe
when
they
do
not
please
you
and
you
will
see
them
quake
like
mice
when
the
cat
is
mentioned
i
am
used
to
taming
wild
beasts
he
added
with
a
smile
you
strike
me
as
being
a
demon
said
esther
clinging
closer
to
lucien
my
child
i
tried
to
win
you
to
heaven
but
a
repentant
magdalen
is
always
a
practical
joke
on
the
church
if
ever
there
were
one
she
would
relapse
into
the
courtesan
in
paradise
you
have
gained
this
much
you
are
forgotten
and
have
acquired
the
manners
of
a
lady
for
you
learned
in
the
convent
what
you
never
could
have
learned
in
the
ranks
of
infamy
in
which
you
were
you
owe
me
nothing
said
he
observing
a
beautiful
look
of
gratitude
on
esther
s
face
i
did
it
all
for
him
and
he
pointed
to
lucien
you
are
you
will
always
be
you
will
die
a
prostitute
for
in
spite
of
the
delightful
theories
of
you
can
never
here
below
become
anything
but
what
you
are
the
man
who
feels
bumps
is
right
you
have
the
bump
of
the
spaniard
it
will
be
seen
was
a
fatalist
like
napoleon
mahomet
and
many
other
great
politicians
it
is
a
strange
thing
that
most
men
of
action
have
a
tendency
to
fatalism
just
as
most
great
thinkers
have
a
tendency
to
believe
in
providence
what
i
am
i
do
not
know
said
esther
with
angelic
sweetness
but
i
love
lucien
and
shall
die
worshiping
come
to
breakfast
said
the
spaniard
sharply
and
pray
to
god
that
lucien
may
not
marry
too
soon
for
then
you
would
never
see
him
his
marriage
would
be
my
death
said
she
she
allowed
the
sham
priest
to
lead
the
way
that
she
might
stand
on
tiptoe
and
whisper
to
lucien
without
being
seen
is
it
your
wish
said
she
that
i
should
remain
in
the
power
of
this
man
who
sets
two
hyenas
to
guard
me
lucien
bowed
his
head
the
poor
child
swallowed
down
her
grief
and
affected
gladness
but
she
felt
cruelly
oppressed
it
needed
more
than
a
year
of
constant
and
devoted
care
before
she
was
accustomed
to
these
two
dreadful
creatures
whom
carlos
herrera
called
the
two
lucien
s
conduct
since
his
return
to
paris
had
borne
the
stamp
of
such
profound
policy
that
it
excited
and
could
not
fail
to
excite
the
jealousy
of
all
his
former
friends
on
whom
he
took
no
vengeance
but
by
making
them
furious
at
his
success
at
his
exquisite
get
up
and
his
way
of
keeping
every
one
at
a
distance
the
poet
once
so
communicative
so
genial
had
turned
cold
and
reserved
de
marsay
the
model
adopted
by
all
the
youth
of
paris
did
not
make
a
greater
display
of
reticence
in
speech
and
deed
than
did
lucien
as
to
brains
the
journalist
had
ere
now
proved
his
mettle
de
marsay
against
whom
many
people
chose
to
pit
lucien
giving
a
preference
to
the
poet
was
enough
to
resent
this
lucien
now
in
high
favor
with
men
who
secretly
pulled
the
wires
of
power
was
so
completely
indifferent
to
literary
fame
that
he
did
not
care
about
the
success
of
his
romance
republished
under
its
real
title
archer
de
charles
or
the
excitement
caused
by
his
volume
of
sonnets
called
of
which
dauriat
sold
out
the
edition
in
a
week
it
is
posthumous
fame
said
he
with
a
laugh
to
mademoiselle
des
touches
who
congratulated
him
the
terrible
spaniard
held
his
creature
with
an
iron
hand
keeping
him
in
the
road
towards
the
goal
where
the
trumpets
and
gifts
of
victory
await
patient
politicians
lucien
had
taken
beaudenord
s
bachelor
quarters
on
the
quai
malaquais
to
be
near
the
rue
taitbout
and
his
adviser
was
lodging
under
the
same
roof
on
the
fourth
floor
lucien
kept
only
one
horse
to
ride
and
drive
a
and
a
groom
when
he
was
not
dining
out
he
dined
with
esther
carlos
herrera
kept
such
a
keen
eye
on
the
service
in
the
house
on
the
quai
malaquais
that
lucien
did
not
spend
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
all
told
ten
thousand
more
were
enough
for
esther
thanks
to
the
unfailing
and
inexplicable
devotion
of
asie
and
europe
lucien
took
the
utmost
precautions
in
going
in
and
out
at
the
rue
taitbout
he
never
came
but
in
a
cab
with
the
blinds
down
and
always
drove
into
the
courtyard
thus
his
passion
for
esther
and
the
very
existence
of
the
establishment
in
the
rue
taitbout
being
unknown
to
the
world
did
him
no
harm
in
his
connections
or
undertakings
no
rash
word
ever
escaped
him
on
this
delicate
subject
his
mistakes
of
this
sort
with
regard
to
coralie
at
the
time
of
his
first
stay
in
paris
had
given
him
experience
in
the
first
place
his
life
was
marked
by
the
correct
regularity
under
which
many
mysteries
can
be
hidden
he
remained
in
society
every
night
till
one
in
the
morning
he
was
always
at
home
from
ten
till
one
in
the
afternoon
then
he
drove
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
paid
calls
till
five
he
was
rarely
seen
to
be
on
foot
and
thus
avoided
old
acquaintances
when
some
journalist
or
one
of
his
former
associates
waved
him
a
greeting
he
responded
with
a
bow
polite
enough
to
avert
annoyance
but
significant
of
such
deep
contempt
as
killed
all
french
geniality
he
thus
had
very
soon
got
rid
of
persons
whom
he
would
rather
never
have
known
an
aversion
kept
him
from
going
to
see
madame
d
espard
who
often
wished
to
get
him
to
her
house
but
when
he
met
her
at
those
of
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
of
mademoiselle
des
touches
of
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
or
elsewhere
he
was
always
exquisitely
polite
to
her
this
hatred
fully
reciprocated
by
madame
d
espard
compelled
lucien
to
act
with
prudence
but
it
will
be
seen
how
he
had
added
fuel
to
it
by
allowing
himself
a
stroke
of
revenge
which
gained
him
indeed
a
severe
lecture
from
carlos
you
are
not
yet
strong
enough
to
be
revenged
on
any
one
whoever
it
may
be
said
the
spaniard
when
we
are
walking
under
a
burning
sun
we
do
not
stop
to
gather
even
the
finest
lucien
was
so
genuinely
superior
and
had
so
fine
a
future
before
him
that
the
young
men
who
chose
to
be
offended
or
puzzled
by
his
return
to
paris
and
his
unaccountable
good
fortune
were
enchanted
whenever
they
could
do
him
an
ill
turn
he
knew
that
he
had
many
enemies
and
was
well
aware
of
those
hostile
feelings
among
his
friends
the
abbe
indeed
took
admirable
care
of
his
adopted
son
putting
him
on
his
guard
against
the
treachery
of
the
world
and
the
fatal
imprudence
of
youth
lucien
was
expected
to
tell
and
did
in
fact
tell
the
abbe
each
evening
every
trivial
incident
of
the
day
thanks
to
his
mentor
s
advice
he
put
the
keenest
curiosity
the
curiosity
of
the
world
off
the
scent
entrenched
in
the
gravity
of
an
englishman
and
fortified
by
the
redoubts
cast
up
by
diplomatic
circumspection
he
never
gave
any
one
the
right
or
the
opportunity
of
seeing
a
corner
even
of
his
concerns
his
handsome
young
face
had
by
practice
become
as
expressionless
in
society
as
that
of
a
princess
at
a
ceremonial
towards
the
middle
of
his
marriage
began
to
be
talked
of
to
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
who
at
that
time
had
no
less
than
four
daughters
to
provide
for
no
one
doubted
that
in
honor
of
such
an
alliance
the
king
would
revive
for
lucien
the
title
of
marquis
this
distinction
would
establish
lucien
s
fortune
as
a
diplomate
and
he
would
probably
be
accredited
as
minister
to
some
german
court
for
the
last
three
years
lucien
s
life
had
been
regular
and
above
reproach
indeed
de
marsay
had
made
this
remarkable
speech
about
him
that
young
fellow
must
have
a
very
strong
hand
behind
thus
lucien
was
almost
a
person
of
importance
his
passion
for
esther
had
in
fact
helped
him
greatly
to
play
his
part
of
a
serious
man
a
habit
of
this
kind
guards
an
ambitious
man
from
many
follies
having
no
connection
with
any
woman
of
fashion
he
can
not
be
caught
by
the
reactions
of
mere
physical
nature
on
his
moral
sense
as
to
happiness
lucien
s
was
the
realization
of
a
poet
s
dreams
a
penniless
poet
s
hungering
in
a
garret
esther
the
ideal
courtesan
in
love
while
she
reminded
lucien
of
coralie
the
actress
with
whom
he
had
lived
for
a
year
completely
eclipsed
her
every
loving
and
devoted
woman
invents
seclusion
incognito
the
life
of
a
pearl
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
but
to
most
of
them
this
is
no
more
than
one
of
the
delightful
whims
which
supply
a
subject
for
conversation
a
proof
of
love
which
they
dream
of
giving
but
do
not
give
whereas
esther
to
whom
her
first
enchantment
was
ever
new
who
lived
perpetually
in
the
glow
of
lucien
s
first
incendiary
glance
never
in
four
yours
had
an
impulse
of
curiosity
she
gave
her
whole
mind
to
the
task
of
adhering
to
the
terms
of
the
programme
prescribed
by
the
sinister
spaniard
nay
more
in
the
midst
of
intoxicating
happiness
she
never
took
unfair
advantage
of
the
unlimited
power
that
the
constantly
revived
desire
of
a
lover
gives
to
the
woman
he
loves
to
ask
lucien
a
single
question
regarding
herrera
of
whom
indeed
she
lived
in
constant
awe
she
dared
not
even
think
of
him
the
elaborate
benefactions
of
that
extraordinary
man
to
whom
esther
undoubtedly
owed
her
feminine
accomplishment
and
her
manner
struck
the
poor
girl
as
advances
on
account
of
hell
i
shall
have
to
pay
for
all
this
some
day
she
would
tell
herself
with
dismay
every
fine
night
she
went
out
in
a
hired
carriage
she
was
driven
with
a
rapidity
no
doubt
insisted
on
by
the
abbe
in
one
or
another
of
the
beautiful
woods
round
paris
boulogne
vincennes
romainville
or
avray
often
with
lucien
sometimes
alone
with
europe
there
she
could
walk
about
without
fear
for
when
lucien
was
not
with
her
she
was
attended
by
a
servant
dressed
like
the
smartest
of
outriders
armed
with
a
real
knife
whose
face
and
brawny
build
alike
proclaimed
him
a
ruthless
athlete
this
protector
was
also
provided
in
the
fashion
of
english
footmen
with
a
stick
but
such
as
players
use
with
which
they
can
keep
off
more
than
one
assailant
in
obedience
to
an
order
of
the
abbe
s
esther
had
never
spoken
a
word
to
this
escort
when
madame
wished
to
go
home
europe
gave
a
call
the
man
in
waiting
whistled
to
the
driver
who
was
always
within
hearing
when
lucien
was
walking
with
esther
europe
and
this
man
remained
about
a
hundred
paces
behind
like
two
of
the
infernal
minions
that
figure
in
the
and
one
which
enchanters
place
at
the
service
of
their
devotees
the
men
and
yet
more
the
women
of
paris
know
nothing
of
the
charm
of
a
walk
in
the
woods
on
a
fine
night
the
stillness
the
moonlight
effects
the
solitude
have
the
soothing
effect
of
a
bath
esther
usually
went
out
at
ten
walked
about
from
midnight
till
one
o
clock
and
came
in
at
two
it
was
never
daylight
in
her
rooms
till
eleven
she
then
bathed
and
went
through
an
elaborate
toilet
which
is
unknown
to
most
women
for
it
takes
up
too
much
time
and
is
rarely
carried
out
by
any
but
courtesans
women
of
the
town
or
fine
ladies
who
have
the
day
before
them
she
was
only
just
ready
when
lucien
came
and
appeared
before
him
as
a
newly
opened
flower
her
only
care
was
that
her
poet
should
be
happy
she
was
his
toy
his
chattel
she
gave
him
entire
liberty
she
never
cast
a
glance
beyond
the
circle
where
she
shone
on
this
the
abbe
had
insisted
for
it
was
part
of
his
profound
policy
that
lucien
should
have
gallant
adventures
happiness
has
no
history
and
the
of
all
lands
have
understood
this
so
well
that
the
words
they
are
happy
are
the
end
of
every
love
tale
hence
only
the
ways
and
means
can
be
recorded
of
this
really
romantic
happiness
in
the
heart
of
paris
it
was
happiness
in
its
loveliest
form
a
poem
a
symphony
of
four
years
duration
every
woman
will
exclaim
that
was
much
neither
esther
nor
lucien
had
ever
said
this
is
too
much
and
the
formula
they
were
happy
was
more
emphatically
true
than
even
in
a
fairy
tale
for
they
had
so
lucien
could
coquet
with
the
world
give
way
to
his
poet
s
caprices
and
it
may
be
plainly
admitted
to
the
necessities
of
his
position
all
this
time
he
was
slowly
making
his
way
and
was
able
to
render
secret
service
to
certain
political
personages
by
helping
them
in
their
work
in
such
matters
he
was
eminently
discreet
he
cultivated
madame
de
serizy
s
circle
being
it
was
rumored
on
the
very
best
terms
with
that
lady
madame
de
serizy
had
carried
him
off
from
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
who
it
was
said
had
thrown
him
over
one
of
the
phrases
by
which
women
avenge
themselves
on
happiness
they
envy
lucien
was
in
the
lap
so
to
speak
of
the
high
almoner
s
set
and
intimate
with
women
who
were
the
archbishop
s
personal
friends
he
was
modest
and
reserved
he
waited
patiently
so
de
marsay
s
speech
de
marsay
was
now
married
and
made
his
wife
live
as
retired
a
life
as
esther
was
significant
in
more
ways
that
one
but
the
submarine
perils
of
such
a
course
as
lucien
s
will
be
sufficiently
obvious
in
the
course
of
this
chronicle
matters
were
in
this
position
when
one
fine
night
in
august
the
baron
de
nucingen
was
driving
back
to
paris
from
the
country
residence
of
a
foreign
banker
settled
in
france
with
whom
he
had
been
dining
the
estate
lay
at
eight
leagues
from
paris
in
the
district
of
la
brie
now
the
baron
s
coachman
having
undertaken
to
drive
his
master
there
and
back
with
his
own
horses
at
nightfall
ventured
to
moderate
the
pace
as
they
entered
the
forest
of
vincennes
the
position
of
beast
man
and
master
was
as
follows
the
coachman
liberally
soaked
in
the
kitchen
of
the
aristocrat
of
the
bourse
was
perfectly
tipsy
and
slept
soundly
while
still
holding
the
reins
to
deceive
other
wayfarers
the
footman
seated
behind
was
snoring
like
a
wooden
top
from
germany
the
land
of
little
carved
figures
of
large
and
of
the
baron
had
tried
to
think
but
after
passing
the
bridge
at
gournay
the
soft
somnolence
of
digestion
had
sealed
his
eyes
the
horses
understood
the
coachman
s
plight
from
the
slackness
of
the
reins
they
heard
the
footman
s
basso
continuo
from
his
perch
behind
they
saw
that
they
were
masters
of
the
situation
and
took
advantage
of
their
few
minutes
freedom
to
make
their
own
pace
like
intelligent
slaves
they
gave
highway
robbers
the
chance
of
plundering
one
of
the
richest
capitalists
in
france
the
most
deeply
cunning
of
the
race
which
in
france
have
been
energetically
styled
lynxes
finally
being
independent
of
control
and
tempted
by
the
curiosity
which
every
one
must
have
remarked
in
domestic
animals
they
stopped
where
four
roads
met
face
to
face
with
some
other
horses
whom
they
no
doubt
asked
in
horses
language
who
may
you
be
what
are
you
doing
are
you
comfortable
when
the
chaise
stopped
the
baron
awoke
from
his
nap
at
first
he
fancied
that
he
was
still
in
his
friend
s
park
then
he
was
startled
by
a
celestial
vision
which
found
him
unarmed
with
his
usual
weapon
the
moonlight
was
brilliant
he
could
have
read
by
it
even
an
evening
paper
in
the
silence
of
the
forest
under
this
pure
light
the
baron
saw
a
woman
alone
who
as
she
got
into
a
hired
chaise
looked
at
the
strange
spectacle
of
this
carriage
at
the
sight
of
this
angel
the
baron
felt
as
though
a
light
had
flashed
into
glory
within
him
the
young
lady
seeing
herself
admired
pulled
down
her
veil
with
terrified
haste
the
gave
a
signal
which
the
driver
perfectly
understood
for
the
vehicle
went
off
like
an
arrow
the
old
banker
was
fearfully
agitated
the
blood
left
his
feet
cold
and
carried
fire
to
his
brain
his
head
sent
the
flame
back
to
his
heart
he
was
chocking
the
unhappy
man
foresaw
a
fit
of
indigestion
but
in
spite
of
that
supreme
terror
he
stood
up
follow
qvick
fery
tam
you
you
are
ashleep
he
cried
a
hundert
franc
if
you
catch
up
dat
at
the
words
a
hundred
francs
the
coachman
woke
up
the
servant
behind
heard
them
no
doubt
in
his
dreams
the
baron
reiterated
his
orders
the
coachman
urged
the
horses
to
a
gallop
and
at
the
barriere
du
trone
had
succeeded
in
overtaking
a
carriage
resembling
that
in
which
nucingen
had
seen
the
divine
fair
one
but
which
contained
a
swaggering
from
some
shop
and
a
lady
of
the
rue
vivienne
this
blunder
filled
the
baron
with
consternation
if
only
i
had
prought
chorge
inshtead
of
you
shtupid
fool
he
should
have
fount
dat
voman
said
he
to
the
servant
while
the
excise
officers
were
searching
the
carriage
indeed
monsieur
le
baron
the
devil
was
behind
the
chaise
i
believe
disguised
as
an
armed
escort
and
he
sent
this
chaise
instead
of
dere
is
no
such
ting
as
de
teufel
said
the
baron
the
baron
de
nucingen
owned
to
sixty
he
no
longer
cared
for
women
and
for
his
wife
least
of
all
he
boasted
that
he
had
never
known
such
love
as
makes
a
fool
of
a
man
he
declared
that
he
was
happy
to
have
done
with
women
the
most
angelic
of
them
he
frankly
said
was
not
worth
what
she
cost
even
if
you
got
her
for
nothing
he
was
supposed
to
be
so
entirely
blase
that
he
no
longer
paid
two
thousand
francs
a
month
for
the
pleasure
of
being
deceived
his
eyes
looked
coldly
down
from
his
opera
box
on
the
corps
de
ballet
never
a
glance
was
shot
at
the
capitalist
by
any
one
of
that
formidable
swarm
of
old
young
girls
and
young
old
women
the
cream
of
paris
pleasure
natural
love
artificial
and
love
love
based
on
and
vanity
love
as
a
display
of
taste
decent
conjugal
love
eccentric
love
the
baron
had
paid
for
them
all
had
known
them
all
excepting
real
spontaneous
love
this
passion
had
now
pounced
down
on
him
like
an
eagle
on
its
prey
as
it
did
on
gentz
the
confidential
friend
of
his
highness
the
prince
of
metternich
all
the
world
knows
what
follies
the
old
diplomate
committed
for
fanny
elssler
whose
rehearsals
took
up
a
great
deal
more
of
his
time
than
the
concerns
of
europe
the
woman
who
had
just
overthrown
that
called
nucingen
had
appeared
to
him
as
one
of
those
who
are
unique
in
their
generation
it
is
not
certain
that
titian
s
mistress
or
leonardo
da
vinci
s
monna
lisa
or
raphael
s
fornarina
were
as
beautiful
as
this
exquisite
esther
in
whom
not
the
most
practised
eye
of
the
most
experienced
parisian
could
have
detected
the
faintest
trace
of
the
ordinary
courtesan
the
baron
was
especially
startled
by
the
noble
and
stately
air
the
air
of
a
woman
which
esther
beloved
and
lapped
in
luxury
elegance
and
devotedness
had
in
the
highest
degree
happy
love
is
the
divine
unction
of
women
it
makes
them
all
as
lofty
as
empresses
for
eight
nights
in
succession
the
baron
went
to
the
forest
of
vincennes
then
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
to
the
woods
of
avray
to
meudon
in
short
everywhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
paris
but
failed
to
meet
esther
that
beautiful
jewish
face
which
he
called
a
face
out
of
te
biple
was
always
before
his
eyes
by
the
end
of
a
fortnight
he
had
lost
his
appetite
delphine
de
nucingen
and
her
daughter
augusta
whom
the
baroness
was
now
taking
out
did
not
at
first
perceive
the
change
that
had
come
over
the
baron
the
mother
and
daughter
only
saw
him
at
breakfast
in
the
morning
and
at
dinner
in
the
evening
when
they
all
dined
at
home
and
this
was
only
on
the
evenings
when
delphine
received
company
but
by
the
end
of
two
months
tortured
by
a
fever
of
impatience
and
in
a
state
like
that
produced
by
acute
the
baron
amazed
to
find
his
millions
impotent
grew
so
thin
and
seemed
so
seriously
ill
that
delphine
had
secret
hopes
of
finding
herself
a
widow
she
pitied
her
husband
somewhat
hypocritically
and
kept
her
daughter
in
seclusion
she
bored
her
husband
with
questions
he
answered
as
englishmen
answer
when
suffering
from
spleen
hardly
a
word
delphine
de
nucingen
gave
a
grand
dinner
every
sunday
she
had
chosen
that
day
for
her
receptions
after
observing
that
no
people
of
fashion
went
to
the
play
and
that
the
day
was
pretty
generally
an
open
one
the
emancipation
of
the
shopkeeping
and
middle
classes
makes
sunday
almost
as
tiresome
in
paris
as
it
is
deadly
in
london
so
the
baroness
invited
the
famous
desplein
to
dinner
to
consult
him
in
spite
of
the
sick
man
for
nucingen
persisted
in
asserting
that
he
was
perfectly
well
keller
rastignac
de
marsay
du
tillet
all
their
friends
had
made
the
baroness
understand
that
a
man
like
nucingen
could
not
be
allowed
to
die
without
any
notice
being
taken
of
it
his
enormous
business
transactions
demanded
some
care
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
know
where
he
stood
these
gentlemen
also
were
asked
to
dinner
and
the
comte
de
gondreville
francois
keller
s
the
chevalier
d
espard
des
lupeaulx
doctor
bianchon
desplein
s
best
beloved
pupil
beaudenord
and
his
wife
the
comte
and
comtesse
de
montcornet
blondet
mademoiselle
des
touches
and
conti
and
finally
lucien
de
rubempre
for
whom
rastignac
had
for
the
last
five
years
manifested
the
warmest
regard
by
order
as
the
advertisements
have
it
we
shall
not
find
it
easy
to
get
rid
of
that
young
fellow
said
blondet
to
rastignac
when
he
saw
lucien
come
in
handsomer
than
ever
and
uncommonly
well
dressed
it
is
wiser
to
make
friends
with
him
for
he
is
formidable
said
rastignac
he
said
de
marsay
no
one
is
formidable
to
my
knowledge
but
men
whose
position
is
assured
and
his
is
unattacked
rather
than
attackable
look
here
what
does
he
live
on
where
does
his
money
come
from
he
has
i
am
certain
sixty
thousand
francs
in
he
has
found
a
friend
in
a
very
rich
spanish
priest
who
has
taken
a
fancy
to
him
replied
rastignac
he
is
going
to
be
married
to
the
eldest
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
said
mademoiselle
des
touches
yes
said
the
chevalier
d
espard
but
they
require
him
to
buy
an
estate
worth
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
as
security
for
the
fortune
he
is
to
settle
on
the
young
lady
and
for
that
he
needs
a
million
francs
which
are
not
to
be
found
in
any
spaniard
s
that
is
dear
for
clotilde
is
very
ugly
said
the
baroness
madame
de
nucingen
affected
to
call
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
by
her
christian
name
as
though
she
nee
goriot
frequented
that
society
no
replied
du
tillet
the
daughter
of
a
duchess
is
never
ugly
to
the
like
of
us
especially
when
she
brings
with
her
the
title
of
marquis
and
a
diplomatic
appointment
but
the
great
obstacle
to
the
marriage
is
madame
de
serizy
s
insane
passion
for
lucien
she
must
give
him
a
great
deal
of
then
i
am
not
surprised
at
seeing
lucien
so
serious
for
madame
de
serizy
will
certainly
not
give
him
a
million
francs
to
help
him
to
marry
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
he
probably
sees
no
way
out
of
the
scrape
said
de
marsay
but
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
worships
him
said
the
comtesse
de
montcornet
and
with
the
young
person
s
assistance
he
may
perhaps
make
better
and
what
will
he
do
with
his
sister
and
at
angouleme
asked
the
chevalier
d
espard
well
his
sister
is
rich
replied
rastignac
and
he
now
speaks
of
her
as
madame
sechard
de
whatever
difficulties
there
may
be
he
is
a
very
fellow
said
bianchon
rising
to
greet
lucien
how
do
my
dear
fellow
said
rastignac
shaking
hands
warmly
with
lucien
de
marsay
bowed
coldly
after
lucien
had
first
bowed
to
him
before
dinner
desplein
and
bianchon
who
studied
the
baron
while
amusing
him
convinced
themselves
that
this
malady
was
entirely
nervous
but
neither
could
guess
the
cause
so
impossible
did
it
seem
that
the
great
politician
of
the
money
market
could
be
in
love
when
bianchon
seeing
nothing
but
love
to
account
for
the
banker
s
condition
hinted
as
much
to
delphine
de
nucingen
she
smiled
as
a
woman
who
has
long
known
all
her
husband
s
weaknesses
after
dinner
however
when
they
all
adjourned
to
the
garden
the
more
intimate
of
the
party
gathered
round
the
banker
eager
to
clear
up
this
extraordinary
case
when
they
heard
bianchon
pronounce
that
nucingen
must
be
in
love
do
you
know
baron
said
de
marsay
that
you
have
grown
very
thin
you
are
suspected
of
violating
the
laws
of
financial
ach
nefer
said
the
baron
yes
yes
replied
de
marsay
they
dare
to
say
that
you
are
in
dat
is
true
replied
nucingen
piteously
i
am
in
lof
for
somebody
i
do
not
you
in
love
you
you
are
a
coxcomb
said
the

a

exclaimed
rastignac
seeing
esther
s
lover
smile
who
doesn

know
the
woman
who
would
go
out
at
midnight
to
meet
nucingen
said
lucien
turning
on
his
heel
well
she
is
not
a
woman
who
is
seen
in
society
or
the
baron
would
have
recognized
the
man
said
the
chevalier
d

replied
the
baron
and
for
forty
days
now
i
have
had
her
seeked
for
by

police
and
dey
do
not
find
it
is
better
that
she
should
cost
you
a
few
hundred
francs
than
cost
you
your
life
said
desplein
and
at
your
age
a
passion
without
hope
is
dangerous

the

replied
du
tillet
he
hates
business
he
is
quite
unlike
himself
it
is
a
sign
of
a
sign
of
lof
replied
nucingen
and
for
me
dat
is
all
de
same
the
simple
candor
of
the
old
man
no
longer
the
who
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
saw
that
something
was
more
sacred
and
more
precious
than
gold
really
moved
these
men
some
exchanged
smiles
other
looked
at
nucingen
with
an
expression
that
plainly
said
such
a
man
to
have
come
to
this
and
then
they
all
returned
to
the
talking
over
the
event
for
it
was
indeed
an
event
calculated
to
produce
the
greatest
sensation
madame
de
nucingen
went
into
fits
of
laughter
when
lucien
betrayed
her
husband
s
secret
but
the
baron
when
he
heard
his
wife
s
sarcasms
took
her
by
the
arm
and
led
her
into
the
recess
of
a
window
motame
said
he
in
an
undertone
have
i
ever
laughed
at
all
at
your
passions
that
you
should
laugh
at
mine
a
goot
frau
should
help
her
husband
out
of
his
difficulty
vidout
making
game
of
him
like
vat
you
from
the
description
given
by
the
old
banker
lucien
had
recognized
his
esther
much
annoyed
that
his
smile
should
have
been
observed
he
took
advantage
of
a
moment
when
coffee
was
served
and
the
conversation
became
general
to
vanish
from
the
scene
what
has
become
of
monsieur
de
rubempre
said
the
baroness
he
is
faithful
to
his
motto
quid
me
continebit
said
rastignac
which
means
who
can
detain
me
or
i
am
unconquerable
as
you
choose
added
de
marsay
just
as
monsieur
le
baron
was
speaking
of
his
unknown
lady
lucien
smiled
in
a
way
that
makes
me
fancy
he
may
know
her
said
horace
bianchon
not
thinking
how
dangerous
such
a
natural
remark
might
be
goot
said
the
banker
to
himself
like
all
incurables
the
baron
clutched
at
everything
that
seemed
at
all
hopeful
he
promised
himself
that
he
would
have
lucien
watched
by
some
one
besides
louchard
and
his
men
louchard
the
sharpest
commercial
detective
in
paris
to
whom
he
had
applied
about
a
fortnight
since
before
going
home
to
esther
lucien
was
due
at
the
hotel
grandlieu
to
spend
the
two
hours
which
made
mademoiselle
clotilde
frederique
de
grandlieu
the
happiest
girl
in
the
faubourg
but
the
prudence
characteristic
of
this
ambitious
youth
warned
him
to
inform
carlos
herrera
forthwith
of
the
effect
resulting
from
the
smile
wrung
from
him
by
the
baron
s
description
of
esther
the
banker
s
passion
for
esther
and
the
idea
that
had
occurred
to
him
of
setting
the
police
to
seek
the
unknown
beauty
were
indeed
events
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
at
once
communicated
to
the
man
who
had
sought
under
a
priest
s
robe
the
shelter
which
criminals
of
old
could
find
in
a
church
and
lucien
s
road
from
the
rue
where
nucingen
at
that
time
lived
to
the
rue
where
was
the
hotel
grandlieu
led
him
past
his
lodgings
on
the
quai
malaquais
lucien
found
his
formidable
friend
smoking
his
breviary
that
is
to
say
coloring
a
short
pipe
before
retiring
to
bed
the
man
strange
rather
than
foreign
had
given
up
spanish
cigarettes
finding
them
too
mild
matters
look
serious
said
the
spaniard
when
lucien
had
told
him
all
the
baron
who
employs
louchard
to
hunt
up
the
girl
will
certainly
be
sharp
enough
to
set
a
spy
at
your
heels
and
everything
will
come
out
and
morning
will
not
give
me
more
than
enough
time
to
pack
the
cards
for
the
game
i
must
play
against
the
baron
first
and
foremost
i
must
prove
to
him
that
the
police
can
not
help
him
when
our
lynx
has
given
up
all
hope
of
finding
his
i
will
undertake
to
sell
her
for
all
she
is
worth
to
him
sell
esther
cried
lucien
whose
first
impulse
was
always
the
right
one
do
you
forget
where
we
stand
cried
carlos
herrera
no
money
left
the
spaniard
went
on
and
sixty
thousand
francs
of
debts
to
be
paid
if
you
want
to
marry
clotilde
de
grandlieu
you
must
invest
a
million
of
francs
in
land
as
security
for
that
ugly
creature
s
settlement
well
then
esther
is
the
quarry
i
mean
to
set
before
that
lynx
to
help
us
to
ease
him
of
that
million
that
is
my
esther
will
never
that
is
my
she
will
die
of
that
is
the
undertaker
s
concern
besides
what
then
cried
the
savage
checking
lucien
s
lamentations
merely
by
his
attitude
how
many
generals
died
in
the
prime
of
life
for
the
emperor
napoleon
he
asked
after
a
short
silence
there
are
always
plenty
of
women
in
coralie
was
unique
in
your
eyes
and
yet
you
found
esther
after
her
will
come
do
you
know
who
the
unknown
fair
and
she
of
all
women
is
the
fairest
and
you
will
find
her
in
the
capital
where
the
duc
de
grandlieu
s
will
be
minister
and
representative
of
the
king
of
and
do
you
tell
me
now
great
baby
that
esther
will
die
of
it
again
can
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
s
husband
keep
esther
you
have
only
to
leave
everything
to
me
you
need
not
take
the
trouble
to
think
at
all
that
is
my
concern
only
you
must
do
without
esther
for
a
week
or
two
but
go
to
the
rue
taitbout
all
the
come
be
off
to
bill
and
coo
on
your
plank
of
salvation
and
play
your
part
well
slip
the
flaming
note
you
wrote
this
morning
into
clotilde
s
hand
and
bring
me
back
a
warm
response
she
will
recompense
herself
for
many
woes
in
writing
i
take
to
that
girl
you
will
find
esther
a
little
depressed
but
tell
her
to
obey
we
must
display
our
livery
of
virtue
our
doublet
of
honesty
the
screen
behind
which
all
great
men
hide
their
i
must
show
off
my
handsomer
self
you
must
never
be
suspected
chance
has
served
us
better
than
my
brain
which
has
been
beating
about
in
a
void
for
these
two
months
all
the
while
he
was
jerking
out
these
dreadful
sentences
one
by
one
like
pistol
shots
carlos
herrera
was
dressing
himself
to
go
out
you
are
evidently
delighted
cried
lucien
you
never
liked
poor
esther
and
you
look
forward
with
joy
to
the
moment
when
you
will
be
rid
of
you
have
never
tired
of
loving
her
have
you
well
i
have
never
tired
of
detesting
her
but
have
i
not
always
behaved
as
though
i
were
sincerely
attached
to
the
hussy
i
who
through
asie
hold
her
life
in
my
hands
a
few
bad
mushrooms
in
a
stew
and
there
an
end
but
mademoiselle
esther
still
lives
and
is
happy
and
do
you
know
why
because
you
love
her
do
not
be
a
fool
for
four
years
we
have
been
waiting
for
a
chance
to
turn
up
for
us
or
against
us
well
it
will
take
something
more
than
mere
cleverness
to
wash
the
cabbage
luck
has
flung
at
us
now
there
are
good
and
bad
together
in
this
turn
of
the
wheel
as
there
are
in
everything
do
you
know
what
i
was
thinking
of
when
you
came
in
of
making
myself
heir
here
as
i
did
at
barcelona
to
an
old
bigot
by
asie
s
a
crime
i
saw
no
other
way
of
securing
your
fortune
the
creditors
are
making
a
stir
if
once
the
bailiffs
were
at
your
heels
and
you
were
turned
out
of
the
hotel
grandlieu
where
would
you
be
there
would
be
the
devil
to
pay
and
carlos
herrera
by
a
pantomimic
gesture
showed
the
suicide
of
a
man
throwing
himself
into
the
water
then
he
fixed
on
lucien
one
of
those
steady
piercing
looks
by
which
the
will
of
a
strong
man
is
injected
so
to
speak
into
a
weak
one
this
fascinating
glare
which
relaxed
all
lucien
s
fibres
of
resistance
revealed
the
existence
not
merely
of
secrets
of
life
and
death
between
him
and
his
adviser
but
also
of
feelings
as
far
above
ordinary
feeling
as
the
man
himself
was
above
his
vile
position
carlos
herrera
a
man
at
once
ignoble
and
magnanimous
obscure
and
famous
compelled
to
live
out
of
the
world
from
which
the
law
had
banned
him
exhausted
by
vice
and
by
frenzied
and
terrible
struggles
though
endowed
with
powers
of
mind
that
ate
into
his
soul
consumed
especially
by
a
fever
of
vitality
now
lived
again
in
the
elegant
person
of
lucien
de
rubempre
whose
soul
had
become
his
own
he
was
represented
in
social
life
by
the
poet
to
whom
he
lent
his
tenacity
and
iron
will
to
him
lucien
was
more
than
a
son
more
than
a
woman
beloved
more
than
a
family
more
than
his
life
he
was
his
revenge
and
as
souls
cling
more
closely
to
a
feeling
than
to
existence
he
had
bound
the
young
man
to
him
by
insoluble
ties
after
rescuing
lucien
s
life
at
the
moment
when
the
poet
in
desperation
was
on
the
verge
of
suicide
he
had
proposed
to
him
one
of
those
infernal
bargains
which
are
heard
of
only
in
romances
but
of
which
the
hideous
possibility
has
often
been
proved
in
courts
of
justice
by
celebrated
criminal
dramas
while
lavishing
on
lucien
all
the
delights
of
paris
life
and
proving
to
him
that
he
yet
had
a
great
future
before
him
he
had
made
him
his
chattel
but
indeed
no
sacrifice
was
too
great
for
this
strange
man
when
it
was
to
gratify
his
second
self
with
all
his
strength
he
was
so
weak
to
this
creature
of
his
making
that
he
had
even
told
him
all
his
secrets
perhaps
this
abstract
complicity
was
a
bond
the
more
between
them
since
the
day
when
la
torpille
had
been
snatched
away
lucien
had
known
on
what
a
vile
foundation
his
good
fortune
rested
that
priest
s
robe
covered
jacques
collin
a
man
famous
on
the
hulks
who
ten
years
since
had
lived
under
the
homely
name
of
vautrin
in
the
maison
vauquer
where
rastignac
and
bianchon
were
at
that
time
boarders
jacques
collin
known
as
had
escaped
from
rochefort
almost
as
soon
as
he
was
recaptured
profiting
by
the
example
of
the
famous
comte
de
while
modifying
all
that
was
ill
planned
in
coignard
s
daring
scheme
to
take
the
place
of
an
honest
man
and
carry
on
the
convict
s
career
is
a
proposition
of
which
the
two
terms
are
too
contradictory
for
a
disastrous
outcome
not
to
be
inevitable
especially
in
paris
for
by
establishing
himself
in
a
family
a
convict
multiplies
tenfold
the
perils
of
such
a
substitution
and
to
be
safe
from
all
investigation
must
not
a
man
assume
a
position
far
above
the
ordinary
interests
of
life
a
man
of
the
world
is
subject
to
risks
such
as
rarely
trouble
those
who
have
no
contact
with
the
world
hence
the
priest
s
gown
is
the
safest
disguise
when
it
can
be
authenticated
by
an
exemplary
life
in
solitude
and
inactivity
so
a
priest
i
will
be
said
the
legally
dead
man
who
was
quite
determined
to
resuscitate
as
a
figure
in
the
world
and
to
satisfy
passions
as
strange
as
himself
the
civil
war
caused
by
the
constitution
of
in
spain
whither
this
energetic
man
had
betaken
himself
enabled
him
to
murder
secretly
the
real
carlos
herrera
from
an
ambush
this
ecclesiastic
the
bastard
son
of
a
grandee
long
since
deserted
by
his
father
and
not
knowing
to
what
woman
he
owed
his
birth
was
intrusted
by
king
ferdinand
to
whom
a
bishop
had
recommended
him
with
a
political
mission
to
france
the
bishop
the
only
man
who
took
any
interest
in
carlos
herrera
died
while
this
foundling
son
of
the
church
was
on
his
journey
from
cadiz
to
madrid
and
from
madrid
to
france
delighted
to
have
met
with
this
opportunity
and
under
the
most
desirable
conditions
jacques
collin
scored
his
back
to
efface
the
fatal
letters
and
altered
his
complexion
by
the
use
of
chemicals
thus
metamorphosing
himself
face
to
face
with
the
corpse
he
contrived
to
achieve
some
likeness
to
his
sosia
and
to
complete
a
change
almost
as
marvelous
as
that
related
in
the
arabian
tale
where
a
dervish
has
acquired
the
power
old
as
he
is
of
entering
into
a
young
body
by
a
magic
spell
the
convict
who
spoke
spanish
learned
as
much
latin
as
an
andalusian
priest
need
know
as
banker
to
three
hulks
collin
was
rich
in
the
cash
intrusted
to
his
known
and
indeed
enforced
honesty
among
such
company
a
mistake
is
paid
for
by
a
dagger
thrust
to
this
capital
he
now
added
the
money
given
by
the
bishop
to
don
carlos
herrera
then
before
leaving
spain
he
was
able
to
possess
himself
of
the
treasure
of
an
old
bigot
at
barcelona
to
whom
he
gave
absolution
promising
that
he
would
make
restitution
of
the
money
constituting
her
fortune
which
his
penitent
had
stolen
by
means
of
murder
jacques
collin
now
a
priest
and
charged
with
a
secret
mission
which
would
secure
him
the
most
brilliant
introductions
in
paris
determined
to
do
nothing
that
might
compromise
the
character
he
had
assumed
and
had
given
himself
up
to
the
chances
of
his
new
life
when
he
met
lucien
on
the
road
between
angouleme
and
paris
in
this
youth
the
sham
priest
saw
a
wonderful
instrument
for
power
he
saved
him
from
suicide
saying
give
yourself
over
to
me
as
to
a
man
of
god
as
men
give
themselves
over
to
the
devil
and
you
will
have
every
chance
of
a
new
career
you
will
live
as
in
a
dream
and
the
worst
awakening
that
can
come
to
you
will
be
death
which
you
now
wish
to
the
alliance
between
these
two
beings
who
were
to
become
one
as
it
were
was
based
on
this
substantial
reasoning
and
carlos
herrera
cemented
it
by
an
ingeniously
plotted
complicity
he
had
the
very
genius
of
corruption
and
undermined
lucien
s
honesty
by
plunging
him
into
cruel
necessity
and
extricating
him
by
obtaining
his
tacit
consent
to
bad
or
disgraceful
actions
which
nevertheless
left
him
pure
loyal
and
noble
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
lucien
was
the
social
magnificence
under
whose
shadow
the
forger
meant
to
live
i
am
the
author
you
are
the
play
if
you
fail
it
is
i
who
shall
be
hissed
said
he
on
the
day
when
he
confessed
his
sacrilegious
disguise
carlos
prudently
confessed
only
a
little
at
a
time
measuring
the
horrors
of
his
revelations
by
lucien
s
progress
and
needs
thus
did
not
let
out
his
last
secret
till
the
habit
of
parisian
pleasures
and
success
and
gratified
vanity
had
enslaved
the
poet
body
and
soul
where
rastignac
when
tempted
by
this
demon
had
stood
firm
lucien
better
managed
and
more
ingeniously
compromised
succumbed
conquered
especially
by
his
satisfaction
in
having
attained
an
eminent
position
incarnate
evil
whose
poetical
embodiment
is
called
the
devil
displayed
every
delightful
seduction
before
this
youth
who
was
half
a
woman
and
at
first
gave
much
and
asked
for
little
the
great
argument
used
by
carlos
was
the
eternal
secret
promised
by
tartufe
to
elmire
the
repeated
proofs
of
absolute
devotion
such
as
that
of
said
to
mahomet
put
the
finishing
touch
to
the
horrible
achievement
of
lucien
s
subjugation
by
a
jacques
collin
at
this
moment
not
only
had
esther
and
lucien
devoured
all
the
funds
intrusted
to
the
honesty
of
the
banker
of
the
hulks
who
for
their
sakes
had
rendered
himself
liable
to
a
dreadful
calling
to
account
but
the
dandy
the
forger
and
the
courtesan
were
also
in
debt
thus
as
the
very
moment
of
lucien
s
expected
success
the
smallest
pebble
under
the
foot
of
either
of
these
three
persons
might
involve
the
ruin
of
the
fantastic
structure
of
fortune
so
audaciously
built
up
at
the
opera
ball
rastignac
had
recognized
the
man
he
had
known
as
vautrin
at
madame
vauquer
s
but
he
knew
that
if
he
did
not
hold
his
tongue
he
was
a
dead
man
so
madame
de
nucingen
s
lover
and
lucien
had
exchanged
glances
in
which
fear
lurked
on
both
sides
under
an
expression
of
amity
in
the
moment
of
danger
rastignac
it
is
clear
would
have
been
delighted
to
provide
the
vehicle
that
should
convey
jacques
collin
to
the
scaffold
from
all
this
it
may
be
understood
that
carlos
heard
of
the
baron
s
passion
with
a
glow
of
sombre
satisfaction
while
he
perceived
in
a
single
flash
all
the
advantage
a
man
of
his
temper
might
derive
by
means
of
a
hapless
esther
go
on
said
he
to
lucien
the
devil
is
mindful
of
his
you
are
smoking
on
a
powder
incedo
per
ignes
replied
carlos
with
a
smile
that
is
my
the
house
of
grandlieu
divided
into
two
branches
about
the
middle
of
the
last
century
first
the
ducal
line
destined
to
lapse
since
the
present
duke
has
only
daughters
and
then
the
vicomtes
de
grandlieu
who
will
now
inherit
the
title
and
armorial
bearings
of
the
elder
branch
the
ducal
house

three
broad
axes
or

with
the
famous
motto
caveo
non

which
epitomizes
the
history
of
the
family
the
coat
of
the
vicomtes

she
returned
from

she
recovered
a
considerable

the
zealous
aid
of
derville
the
lawyer

de

on
coming
home
in
were
the
object
of
the
emperor
s
advances
indeed
napoleon
seeing
them
come
to
his
court
restored
to
them
all
of
the
grandlieu
estates
that
had
been
confiscated
to
the
nation
to
the
amount
of
about
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
of
all
the
great
nobles
of
the
faubourg
who
allowed
themselves
to
be
won
over
by
napoleon
this
duke
and
duchess
she
was
an
ajuda
of
the
senior
branch
and
connected
with
the
braganzas
were
the
only
family
who
afterwards
never
disowned
him
and
his
liberality
when
the
faubourg
remembered
this
as
a
crime
against
the
grandlieus
louis
xviii
respected
them
for
it
but
perhaps
his
only
object
was
to
annoy
a
marriage
was
considered
likely
between
the
young
vicomte
de

and
the
duke

this

of
age
was
deeply
in
love
with

it
need
not
be
asked
whether
the
duc
de
grandlieu
s
mansion
one
of
the
finest
in
the
rue
did
not
exert
a
thousand
spells
over
lucien
s
imagination
every
time
the
heavy
gate
turned
on
its
hinges
to
admit
his
cab
he
experienced
the
gratified
vanity
to
which
mirabeau
confessed
though
my
father
was
a
mere
druggist
at
l
houmeau
i
may
enter
here
this
was
his
thought
and
indeed
he
would
have
committed
far
worse
crimes
than
allying
himself
with
a
forger
to
preserve
his
right
to
mount
the
steps
of
that
entrance
to
hear
himself
announced
monsieur
de
rubempre
at
the
door
of
the
fine
louis
xiv
decorated
in
the
time
of
the
grand
monarque
on
the
pattern
of
those
at
versailles
where
that
choicest
circle
met
that
cream
of
paris
society
called
then
le
petit
chateau
the
noble
portuguese
lady
one
of
those
who
never
care
to
go
out
of
their
own

of

the

and
his
son
the
duc
de

were
constantly
to
be
seen
in
this
stately
where
they
breathed
the
atmosphere
of
a
court
where
manners
tone
and
wit
were
in
harmony
with
the
dignity
of
the
master
and
mistress
whose
aristocratic
mien
and
magnificence
had
obliterated
the
memory
of
their
servility
to
napoleon
the
old
duchesse
d
uxelles
mother
of
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
was
the
oracle
of
this
circle
to
which
madame
de
serizy
had
never
gained
admittance
though
nee
de
ronquerolles
lucien
was
brought
thither
by
madame
de
maufrigneuse
who
had
won
over
her
mother
to
speak
in
his
favor
for
she
had
doted
on
him
for
two
years
and
the
engaging
young
poet
had
kept
his
footing
there
thanks
to
the
influence
of
the
high
almoner
of
france
and
the
support
of
the
archbishop
of
paris
still
he
had
not
been
admitted
till
he
had
obtained
the
patent
restoring
to
him
the
name
and
arms
of
the
rubempre
family
the
duc
de
rhetore
the
chevalier
d
espard
and
some
others
jealous
of
lucien
periodically
stirred
up
the
duc
de
grandlieu
s
prejudices
against
him
by
retailing
anecdotes
of
the
young
man
s
previous
career
but
the
duchess
a
devout
catholic
surrounded
by
the
great
prelates
of
the
church
and
her
daughter
clotilde
would
not
give
him
up
lucien
accounted
for
these
hostilities
by
his
connection
with
madame
de
bargeton
madame
d
espard
s
cousin
and
now
comtesse
du
chatelet
then
feeling
the
importance
of
allying
himself
to
so
powerful
a
family
and
urged
by
his
privy
adviser
to
win
clotilde
lucien
found
the
courage
of
the
parvenu
he
came
to
the
house
five
days
in
the
week
he
swallowed
all
the
affronts
of
the
envious
he
endured
impertinent
looks
and
answered
irony
with
wit
his
persistency
the
charm
of
his
manners
and
his
amiability
at
last
neutralized
opposition
and
reduced
obstacles
he
was
still
in
the
highest
favor
with
madame
de
maufrigneuse
whose
ardent
letters
written
under
the
influence
of
her
passion
were
preserved
by
carlos
herrera
he
was
idolized
by
madame
de
serizy
and
stood
well
in
mademoiselle
des
touches
good
graces
and
well
content
with
being
received
in
these
houses
lucien
was
instructed
by
the
abbe
to
be
as
reserved
as
possible
in
all
other
quarters
you
can
not
devote
yourself
to
several
houses
at
once
said
his
mentor
the
man
who
goes
everywhere
finds
no
one
to
take
a
lively
interest
in
him
great
folks
only
patronize
those
who
emulate
their
furniture
whom
they
see
every
day
and
who
have
the
art
of
becoming
as
necessary
to
them
as
the
seat
they
sit
thus
lucien
accustomed
to
regard
the
grandlieus
as
his
arena
reserved
his
wit
his
jests
his
news
and
his
courtier
s
graces
for
the
hours
he
spent
there
every
evening
insinuating
tactful
and
warned
by
clotilde
of
the
shoals
he
should
avoid
he
flattered
monsieur
de
grandlieu
s
little
weaknesses
clotilde
having
begun
by
envying
madame
de
maufrigneuse
her
happiness
ended
by
falling
desperately
in
love
with
lucien
perceiving
all
the
advantages
of
such
a
connection
lucien
played
his
lover
s
part
as
well
as
it
could
have
been
acted
by
armand
the
latest
at
the
he
wrote
to
clotilde
letters
which
were
certainly
masterpieces
of
literary
workmanship
and
clotilde
replied
vying
with
him
in
genius
in
the
expression
of
perfervid
love
on
paper
for
she
had
no
other
outlet
lucien
went
to
church
at
aquin
every
sunday
giving
himself
out
as
a
devout
catholic
and
he
poured
forth
monarchical
and
pious
harangues
which
were
a
marvel
to
all
he
also
wrote
some
exceedingly
remarkable
articles
in
papers
devoted
to
the
congregation
refusing
to
be
paid
for
them
and
signing
them
only
with
an
he
produced
political
pamphlets
when
required
by
king
charles
or
the
high
almoner
and
for
these
he
would
take
no
payment
the
king
he
would
say
has
done
so
much
for
me
that
i
owe
him
my
for
some
days
past
there
had
been
an
idea
of
attaching
lucien
to
the
prime
minister
s
cabinet
as
his
private
secretary
but
madame
d
espard
brought
so
many
persons
into
the
field
in
opposition
to
lucien
that
charles
s
hesitated
to
clinch
the
matter
nor
was
lucien
s
position
by
any
means
clear
not
only
did
the
question
what
does
he
live
on
on
everybody
s
lips
as
the
young
man
rose
in
life
require
an
answer
but
even
benevolent
curiosity
as
much
as
malevolent
curiosity
went
on
from
one
inquiry
to
another
and
found
more
than
one
joint
in
the
ambitious
youth
s
harness
clotilde
de
grandlieu
unconsciously
served
as
a
spy
for
her
father
and
mother
a
few
days
since
she
had
led
lucien
into
a
recess
and
told
him
of
the
difficulties
raised
by
her
family
invest
a
million
francs
in
land
and
my
hand
is
yours
that
is
my
mother
s
ultimatum
clotilde
had
explained
and
presently
they
will
ask
you
where
you
got
the
money
said
carlos
when
lucien
reported
this
last
word
in
the
bargain
my
will
have
made
his
fortune
remarked
lucien
we
can
make
him
the
responsible
then
only
the
million
is
needed
said
carlos
i
will
think
it
to
be
exact
as
to
lucien
s
position
in
the
hotel
grandlieu
he
had
never
dined
there
neither
clotilde
nor
the
duchesse
d
uxelles
nor
madame
de
maufrigneuse
who
was
always
extremely
kind
to
lucien
could
ever
obtain
this
favor
from
the
duke
so
persistently
suspicious
was
the
old
nobleman
of
the
man
that
he
designated
as
le
sire
de
this
shade
of
distinction
understood
by
every
one
who
visited
at
the
house
constantly
wounded
lucien
s
for
he
felt
that
he
was
no
more
than
tolerated
but
the
world
is
justified
in
being
suspicious
it
is
so
often
taken
in
to
cut
a
figure
in
paris
with
no
known
source
of
wealth
and
no
recognized
employment
is
a
position
which
can
by
no
artifice
be
long
maintained
so
lucien
as
he
crept
up
in
the
world
gave
more
and
more
weight
to
the
question
what
does
he
live
on
he
had
been
obliged
indeed
to
confess
to
madame
de
serizy
to
whom
he
owed
the
patronage
of
monsieur
granville
the
public
prosecutor
and
of
the
comte
octave
de
bauvan
a
minister
of
state
and
president
of
one
of
the
supreme
courts
i
am
dreadfully
in
as
he
entered
the
courtyard
of
the
mansion
where
he
found
an
excuse
for
all
his
vanities
he
was
saying
to
himself
as
he
reflected
on
scheming
i
can
hear
the
ground
cracking
under
my
feet
he
loved
esther
and
he
wanted
to
marry
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
a
strange
dilemma
one
must
be
sold
to
buy
the
other
only
one
person
could
effect
this
bargain
without
damage
to
lucien
s
honor
and
that
was
the
supposed
spaniard
were
they
not
bound
to
be
equally
secret
each
for
the
other
such
a
compact
in
which
each
is
in
turn
master
and
slave
is
not
to
be
found
twice
in
any
one
life
lucien
drove
away
the
clouds
that
darkened
his
brow
and
walked
into
the
grandlieu
gay
and
beaming
at
this
moment
the
windows
were
open
the
fragrance
from
the
garden
scented
the

its

the

on

in

talking
to

several
women
together
formed
a
group
remarkable
for
their
various
attitudes
stamped
with
the
different
expression
which
each
strove
to
give
to
an
affected
sorrow
in
the
fashionable

nobody
takes
any

everything
is

called

corner
of

lucien
was
announced
he
walked
across

to
make
his
bow
to

asking
the

grief

soul
and
feeling
sabine
de
grandlieu
who
was
but
ten
years
old
raised
knowing
eyes
to
her
mother
s
face
but
the
satirical
glance
was
repressed
by
a
glance
from
the
duchess
this
is
bringing
children
up
properly
if
my
daughter
lives
through
the
shock
said
madame
de
chaulieu
with
a
very
maternal
manner
i
shall
be
anxious
about
her
future
life
louise
is
so
very
it
is
so
difficult
nowadays
said
a
venerable
cardinal
to
reconcile
feeling
with
the
lucien
who
had
not
a
word
to
say
went
to
the
to
do
what
was
polite
to
the
demoiselles
de
grandlieu
when
the
poet
had
gone
a
few
yards
away
the
marquise
d
espard
leaned
over
to
whisper
in
the
duchess
ear
and
do
you
really
think
that
that
young
fellow
is
so
much
in
love
with
your
clotilde
the
perfidy
of
this
question
can
not
be
fully
understood
but
with
the
help
of
a
sketch
of
clotilde
that
young
lady
was
at
this
moment
standing
up
her
attitude
allowed
the
marquise
d
espard
s
mocking
eye
to
take
in
clotilde
s
lean
narrow
figure
exactly
like
an
asparagus
stalk
the
poor
girl
s
bust
was
so
flat
that
it
did
not
allow
of
the
artifice
known
to
dressmakers
as
or
padded
habitshirts
and
clotilde
who
knew
that
her
name
was
a
sufficient
advantage
in
life
far
from
trying
to
conceal
this
defect
heroically
made
a
display
of
it
by
wearing
plain
tight
dresses
she
achieved
the
effect
of
that
stiff
prim
shape
which
medieval
sculptors
succeeded
in
giving
to
the
statuettes
whose
profiles
are
conspicuous
against
the
background
of
the
niches
in
which
they
stand
in
cathedrals
clotilde
was
more
than
five
feet
four
in
height
if
we
may
be
allowed
to
use
a
familiar
phrase
which
has
the
merit
at
any
rate
of
being
perfectly
intelligible
she
was
all
legs
these
defective
proportions
gave
her
figure
an
almost
deformed
appearance
with
a
dark
complexion
harsh
black
hair
very
thick
eyebrows
fiery
eyes
set
in
sockets
that
were
already
deeply
discolored
a
side
face
shaped
like
the
moon
in
its
first
quarter
and
a
prominent
brow
she
was
the
caricature
of
her
mother
one
of
the
handsomest
women
in
portugal
nature
amuses
herself
with
such
tricks
often
we
see
in
one
family
a
sister
of
wonderful
beauty
whose
features
in
her
brother
are
absolutely
hideous
though
the
two
are
amazingly
alike
clotilde
s
lips
excessively
thin
and
sunken
wore
a
permanent
expression
of
disdain
and
yet
her
mouth
better
than
any
other
feature
of
her
face
revealed
every
secret
impulse
of
her
heart
for
affection
lent
it
a
sweet
expression
which
was
all
the
more
remarkable
because
her
cheeks
were
too
sallow
for
blushes
and
her
hard
black
eyes
never
told
anything
notwithstanding
these
defects
notwithstanding
her
carriage
she
had
by
birth
and
education
a
grand
air
a
proud
demeanor
in
short
everything
that
has
been
well
named
le
je
ne
sais
quoi
due
partly
perhaps
to
her
uncompromising
simplicity
of
dress
which
stamped
her
as
a
woman
of
noble
blood
she
dressed
her
hair
to
advantage
and
it
might
be
accounted
to
her
for
a
beauty
for
it
grew
vigorously
thick
and
long
she
had
cultivated
her
voice
and
it
could
cast
a
spell
she
sang
exquisitely
clotilde
was
just
the
woman
of
whom
one
says
she
has
fine
eyes
or
she
has
a
delightful
if
any
one
addressed
her
in
the
english
fashion
as
your
grace
she
would
say
you
mean
your
why
should
not
my
poor
clotilde
have
a
lover
replied
the
duchess
to
the
marquise
do
you
know
what
she
said
to
me
yesterday
if
i
am
loved
for
ambition
s
sake
i
undertake
to
make
him
love
me
for
my
own
she
is
clever
and
ambitious
and
there
are
men
who
like
those
two
qualities
as
for
him
my
dear
he
is
as
handsome
as
a
vision
and
if
he
can
but
repurchase
the
rubempre
estates
out
of
regard
for
us
the
king
will
reinstate
him
in
the
title
of
after
all
his
mother
was
the
last
of
the
poor
fellow
where
is
he
to
find
a
million
francs
said
the
marquise
that
is
no
concern
of
ours
replied
the
duchess
he
is
certainly
incapable
of
stealing
the
besides
we
would
never
give
clotilde
to
an
intriguing
or
dishonest
man
even
if
he
were
handsome
young
and
a
poet
like
monsieur
de
you
are
late
this
evening
said
clotilde
smiling
at
lucien
with
infinite
graciousness
yes
i
have
been
dining
you
have
been
quite
gay
these
last
few
days
said
she
concealing
her
jealousy
and
anxiety
behind
a
smile
quite
gay
replied
lucien
no
only
by
the
merest
chance
i
have
been
dining
every
day
this
week
with
bankers
with
the
nucingens
yesterday
with
du
tillet
the
day
before
with
the
kellers
whence
it
may
be
seen
that
lucien
had
succeeded
in
assuming
the
tone
of
light
impertinence
of
great
people
you
have
many
enemies
said
clotilde
offering
him
how
graciously
a
cup
of
tea
some
one
told
my
father
that
you
have
debts
to
the
amount
of
sixty
thousand
francs
and
that
before
long
will
be
your
summer
if
you
could
know
what
all
these
calumnies
are
to
me
it
all
recoils
on
i
say
nothing
of
my
own
suffering
my
father
has
a
way
of
looking
that
crucifies
me
but
of
what
you
must
be
suffering
if
any
least
part
of
it
should
be
the
do
not
let
such
nonsense
worry
you
love
me
as
i
love
you
and
give
me
time
a
few
months
said
lucien
replacing
his
empty
cup
on
the
silver
tray
do
not
let
my
father
see
you
he
would
say
something
disagreeable
and
as
you
could
not
submit
to
that
we
should
be
done
that
odious
marquise
d
espard
told
him
that
your
mother
had
been
a
monthly
nurse
and
that
your
sister
did
ironing
we
were
in
the
most
abject
poverty
replied
lucien
the
tears
rising
to
his
eyes
that
is
not
calumny
but
it
is
most
gossip
my
sister
now
is
a
more
than
millionaire
and
my
mother
has
been
dead
two
this
information
has
been
kept
in
stock
to
use
just
when
i
should
be
on
the
verge
of
success
here
but
what
have
you
done
to
madame
d
espard
i
was
so
rash
at
madame
de
serizy
s
as
to
tell
the
story
with
some
added
pleasantries
in
the
presence
of
mm
de
bauvan
and
de
granville
of
her
attempt
to
get
a
commission
of
lunacy
appointed
to
sit
on
her
husband
the
marquis
d
espard
bianchon
had
told
it
to
me
monsieur
de
granville
s
opinion
supported
by
those
of
bauvan
and
serizy
influenced
the
decision
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
they
all
were
afraid
of
the
des
and
dreaded
the
scandal
and
the
marquise
got
her
knuckles
rapped
in
the
summing
up
for
the
judgment
finally
recorded
in
that
miserable
business
though
de
serizy
by
his
tattle
has
made
the
marquise
my
mortal
foe
i
gained
his
good
offices
and
those
of
the
public
prosecutor
and
comte
octave
de
bauvan
for
madame
de
serizy
told
them
the
danger
in
which
i
stood
in
consequence
of
their
allowing
the
source
of
their
information
to
be
guessed
at
the
marquis
d
espard
was
so
clumsy
as
to
call
upon
me
regarding
me
as
the
first
cause
of
his
winning
the
day
in
that
atrocious
i
will
rescue
you
from
madame
d
espard
said
clotilde
how
cried
lucien
my
mother
will
ask
the
young
d
espards
here
they
are
charming
boys
and
growing
up
now
the
father
and
sons
will
sing
your
praises
and
then
we
are
sure
never
to
see
their
mother
oh
clotilde
you
are
an
angel
if
i
did
not
love
you
for
yourself
i
should
love
you
for
being
so
it
is
not
cleverness
said
she
all
her
love
beaming
on
her
lips
goodnight
do
not
come
again
for
some
few
days
when
you
see
me
in
church
at
aquin
with
a
pink
scarf
my
father
will
be
in
a
better
you
will
find
an
answer
stuck
to
the
back
of
the
chair
you
are
sitting
in
it
will
comfort
you
perhaps
for
not
seeing
me
put
the
note
you
have
brought
under
my
handkerchief
this
young
person
was
evidently
more
than
lucien
took
a
cab
in
the
rue
de
la
planche
got
out
of
it
on
the
boulevards
took
another
by
the
madeleine
and
desired
the
driver
to
have
the
gates
opened
and
drive
in
at
the
house
in
the
rue
taitbout
on
going
in
at
eleven
o
clock
he
found
esther
in
tears
but
dressed
as
she
was
wont
to
dress
to
do
him
honor
she
awaited
her
lucien
reclining
on
a
sofa
covered
with
white
satin
brocaded
with
yellow
flowers
dressed
in
a
bewitching
wrapper
of
india
muslin
with
bows
without
her
stays
her
hair
simply
twisted
into
a
knot
her
feet
in
little
velvet
slippers
lined
with
satin
all
the
candles
were
burning
the
hookah
was
prepared
but
she
had
not
smoked
her
own
which
stood
beside
her
unlighted
emblematical
of
her
loneliness
on
hearing
the
doors
open
she
sprang
up
like
a
gazelle
and
threw
her
arms
round
lucien
wrapping
him
like
a
web
caught
by
the
wind
and
flung
about
a
tree
is
it
true
oh
just
for
a
few
days
replied
lucien
esther
released
him
and
fell
back
on
her
divan
like
a
dead
thing
in
these
circumstances
most
women
babble
like
parrots
oh
how
they
love
at
the
end
of
five
years
they
feel
as
if
their
first
happiness
were
a
thing
of
yesterday
they
can
not
give
you
up
they
are
magnificent
in
their
indignation
despair
love
grief
dread
dejection
presentiments
in
short
they
are
as
sublime
as
a
scene
from
shakespeare
but
make
no
mistake
these
women
do
not
love
when
they
are
really
all
that
they
profess
when
they
love
truly
they
do
as
esther
did
as
children
do
as
true
love
does
esther
did
not
say
a
word
she
lay
with
her
face
buried
in
the
pillows
shedding
bitter
tears
lucien
on
his
part
tried
to
lift
her
up
and
spoke
to
her
but
my
child
we
are
not
to
part
what
after
four
years
of
happiness
is
this
the
way
you
take
a
short
what
on
earth
do
i
do
to
all
these
girls
he
added
to
himself
remembering
that
coralie
had
loved
him
thus
ah
monsieur
you
are
so
handsome
said
europe
the
senses
have
their
own
ideal
when
added
to
this
fascinating
beauty
we
find
the
sweetness
of
nature
the
poetry
that
characterized
lucien
it
is
easy
to
conceive
of
the
mad
passion
roused
in
such
women
keenly
alive
as
they
are
to
external
gifts
and
artless
in
their
admiration
esther
was
sobbing
quietly
and
lay
in
an
attitude
expressive
of
the
deepest
distress
but
little
goose
said
lucien
did
you
not
understand
that
my
life
is
at
stake
at
these
words
which
he
chose
on
purpose
esther
started
up
like
a
wild
animal
her
hair
fell
tumbling
about
her
excited
face
like
wreaths
of
foliage
she
looked
steadily
at
lucien
your
life
she
cried
throwing
up
her
arms
and
letting
them
drop
with
a
gesture
known
only
to
a
courtesan
in
peril
to
be
sure
that
friend
s
note
speaks
of
serious
she
took
a
shabby
scrap
of
paper
out
of
her
sash
then
seeing
europe
she
said
leave
us
my
when
europe
had
shut
the
door
she
went
on
here
this
is
what
he
writes
and
she
handed
to
lucien
a
note
she
had
just
received
from
carlos
which
lucien
read
aloud
you
must
leave
at
five
in
the
morning
you
will
be
taken
to
a
keeper
s
lodge
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
of
where
you
will
have
a
room
on
the
first
floor
do
not
quit
that
room
till
i
give
you
leave
you
will
want
for
nothing
the
keeper
and
his
wife
are
to
be
trusted
do
not
write
to
lucien
do
not
go
to
the
window
during
daylight
but
you
may
walk
by
night
with
the
keeper
if
you
wish
for
exercise
keep
the
carriage
blinds
down
on
the
way
lucien
s
life
is
at
stake
lucien
will
go
to
bid
you
burn
this
in
his
lucien
burned
the
note
at
once
in
the
flame
of
a
candle
listen
my
own
lucien
said
esther
after
hearing
him
read
this
letter
as
a
criminal
hears
the
sentence
of
death
i
will
not
tell
you
that
i
love
you
it
would
be
idiotic
for
nearly
five
years
it
has
been
as
natural
to
me
to
love
you
as
to
breathe
and
live
from
the
first
day
when
my
happiness
began
under
the
protection
of
that
inscrutable
being
who
placed
me
here
as
you
place
some
little
curious
beast
in
a
cage
i
have
known
that
you
must
marry
marriage
is
a
necessary
factor
in
your
career
and
god
preserve
me
from
hindering
the
development
of
your
fortunes
that
marriage
will
be
my
death
but
i
will
not
worry
you
i
will
not
do
as
the
common
girls
do
who
kill
themselves
by
means
of
a
brazier
of
charcoal
i
had
enough
of
that
once
twice
raises
your
gorge
as
mariette
says
no
i
will
go
a
long
way
off
out
of
france
asie
knows
the
secrets
of
her
country
she
will
help
me
to
die
quietly
a
prick
whiff
it
is
all
over
i
ask
but
one
thing
my
dearest
and
that
is
that
you
will
not
deceive
me
i
have
had
my
share
of
living
since
the
day
i
first
saw
you
in
till
this
day
i
have
known
more
happiness
than
can
be
put
into
the
lives
of
ten
fortunate
wives
so
take
me
for
what
i
am
a
woman
as
strong
as
i
am
weak
say
i
am
going
to
be
i
will
ask
no
more
of
you
than
a
fond
farewell
and
you
shall
never
hear
of
me
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
after
this
explanation
as
sincere
as
her
action
and
tone
were
guileless
is
it
that
you
are
going
to
be
married
she
repeated
looking
into
lucien
s
blue
eyes
with
one
of
her
fascinating
glances
as
brilliant
as
a
steel
blade
we
have
been
toiling
at
my
marriage
for
eighteen
months
past
and
it
is
not
yet
settled
replied
lucien
i
do
not
know
when
it
can
be
settled
but
it
is
not
in
question
now
child
it
is
the
abbe
i
we
are
in
real
peril
nucingen
saw
you
yes
in
the
wood
at
vincennes
said
she
did
he
recognize
me
no
said
lucien
but
he
has
fallen
so
desperately
in
love
with
you
that
he
would
sacrifice
his
coffers
after
dinner
when
he
was
describing
how
he
had
met
you
i
was
so
foolish
as
to
smile
involuntarily
and
most
imprudently
for
i
live
in
a
world
like
a
savage
surrounded
by
the
traps
of
a
hostile
tribe
carlos
who
spares
me
the
pains
of
thinking
regards
the
position
as
dangerous
and
he
has
undertaken
to
pay
nucingen
out
if
the
baron
takes
it
into
his
head
to
spy
on
us
and
he
is
quite
capable
of
it
he
spoke
to
me
of
the
incapacity
of
the
police
you
have
lighted
a
flame
in
an
old
chimney
choked
with
and
what
does
your
spaniard
propose
to
do
asked
esther
very
softly
i
do
not
know
in
the
least
said
lucien
he
told
me
i
might
sleep
soundly
and
leave
it
to
him
but
he
dared
not
look
at
esther
if
that
is
the
case
i
will
obey
him
with
the
submission
i
profess
said
esther
putting
her
hand
through
lucien
s
arm
and
leading
him
into
her
bedroom
saying
at
any
rate
i
hope
you
dined
well
my
lulu
at
that
detestable
baron
s
asie
s
cooking
prevents
my
ever
thinking
a
dinner
good
however
famous
the
chef
may
be
where
i
happen
to

so

the

the
most

esther
was
fussing
about

before

she
came
and
went
and
fluttered
round
singing
all
the

next
morning
at
seven
when
the

awoke
in
the
pretty

he
found
himself
alone
he
rang
and
europe
hurried
in
what

off
this
morning
at
a
quarter
to

one
of
those
people
who

and
we
are
ordered
to
treat
her
as
if
she

what
can
you
have
to
say
to
such
hack
poor
madame
how
she
cried
when
she
got
into
the
carriage
well
it

she

wiping

europe
if

i
should
have
stayed
i

but
have
died

i
tell
you
sir
i
am
so
fond
of
madame
that
i
did
not
show
her
the
person
who
has
taken
her
place
some
waiting
maids
would
have
broken
her
heart
by

and
is
the
stranger
there
well
sir
she
came
in
the
chaise
that
took
away
madame
and
i
hid
her
in
my
room
in
obedience
to
my
instructions
is
she
so
far
as
such
a
article
can
be
but
she
will
find
her
part
easy
enough
if
you
play
yours
sir
said
europe
going
to
fetch
the
false
esther
the
night
before
ere
going
to
bed
the
banker
had
given
his
orders
to
his
valet
who
at
seven
in
the
morning
brought
in
to
him
the
notorious
louchard
the
most
famous
of
the
commercial
police
whom
he
left
in
a
little
there
the
baron
joined
him
in
a
dressing
gown
and
slippers
you
haf
mate
a
fool
of
me
he
said
in
reply
to
this
official
s
greeting
i
could
not
help
myself
monsieur
le
baron
i
do
not
want
to
lose
my
place
and
i
had
the
honor
of
explaining
to
you
that
i
could
not
meddle
in
a
matter
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
functions
what
did
i
promise
you
to
put
you
into
communication
with
one
of
our
agents
who
as
it
seemed
to
me
would
be
best
able
to
serve
you
but
you
know
monsieur
le
baron
the
sharp
lines
that
divide
men
of
different
trades
if
you
build
a
house
you
do
not
set
a
carpenter
to
do
smith
s
work
well
there
are
two
branches
of
the
police
the
political
police
and
the
judicial
police
the
political
police
never
interfere
with
the
other
branch
and
vice
versa
if
you
apply
to
the
chief
of
the
political
police
he
must
get
permission
from
the
minister
to
take
up
our
business
and
you
would
not
dare
to
explain
it
to
the
head
of
the
police
throughout
the
kingdom
a
who
should
act
on
his
own
account
would
lose
his
place
well
the
ordinary
police
are
quite
as
cautious
as
the
political
police
so
no
one
whether
in
the
home
office
or
at
the
prefecture
of
police
ever
moves
excepting
in
the
interests
of
the
state
or
for
the
ends
of
justice
if
there
is
a
plot
or
a
crime
to
be
followed
up
then
indeed
the
heads
of
the
corps
are
at
your
service
but
you
must
understand
monsieur
le
baron
that
they
have
other
fish
to
fry
than
looking
after
the
fifty
thousand
love
affairs
in
paris
as
to
me
and
my
men
our
only
business
is
to
arrest
debtors
and
as
soon
as
anything
else
is
to
be
done
we
run
enormous
risks
if
we
interfere
with
the
peace
and
quiet
of
any
man
or
woman
i
sent
you
one
of
my
men
but
i
told
you
i
could
not

him

him

as
well
look
for
a

as
for
a
woman
in
paris
who
is
supposed
to

vincennes

of
whom
the

he
would
bargain
with

for

thus
as
he
listened
to
louchard
nucingen
had
hastily
concluded
that
contenson
louchard
s
man
must
certainly
know
the
address
of
that
master
spy
contenson
would
tell
him
for
five
hundred
francs
what
louchard
wanted
to
see
a
thousand
crowns
for
the
rapid
calculation
plainly
proves
that
if
the
man

heart
was
in

of

his

was
still

try

little
business
very
visitors
called
to
see
nucingen
on
business
but
he
waited
for
contenson
he
was
dreaming
of
esther
telling
himself
that
before
long
he
would
see
again
the
woman
who
had
aroused
in
him
such
emotions
and
he
sent
everybody
away
with
vague
replies
and
promises
contenson
was
to
him
the
most
important
person
in
paris
and
he
looked
out
into
the
garden
every
minute
finally
after
giving
orders
that
no
one
else
was
to
be
admitted
he
had
his
breakfast
served
in
the
at
one
corner
of
the
garden
in
the
banker
s
office
the
conduct
and
hesitancy
of
the
most
knowing
the
most
clearsighted
the
shrewdest
of
paris
financiers
seemed
inexplicable
what
ails
the
chief
said
a
stockbroker
to
one
of
the
no
one
knows
they
are
anxious
about
his
health
it
would
seem
yesterday
madame
la
baronne
got
desplein
and
bianchon
to
one
day
when
sir
isaac
newton
was
engaged
in
physicking
one
of
his
dogs
named
beauty
who
as
is
well
known
destroyed
a
vast
amount
of
work
and
whom
he
reproved
only
in
these
words
ah
beauty
you
little
know
the
mischief
you
have
done
some
strangers
called
to
see
him
but
they
at
once
retired
respecting
the
great
man
s
occupation
in
every
more
or
less
lofty
life
there
is
a
little
dog
when
the
marechal
de
richelieu
came
to
pay
his
respects
to
louis
xv
after
taking
mahon
one
of
the
greatest
feats
of
arms
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
king
said
to
him
have
you
heard
the
great
news
poor
lansmatt
is
lansmatt
was
a
gatekeeper
in
the
secret
of
the
king
s
intrigues
the
bankers
of
paris
never
knew
how
much
they
owed
to
contenson
that
spy
was
the
cause
of
nucingen
s
allowing
an
immense
loan
to
be
issued
in
which
his
share
was
allotted
to
him
and
which
he
gave
over
to
them
the
could
aim
at
a
fortune
any
day
with
the
artillery
of
speculation
but
the
man
was
a
slave
to
the
hope
of
happiness
the
great
banker
drank
some
tea
and
was
nibbling
at
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
as
a
man
does
whose
teeth
have
for
long
been
sharpened
by
appetite
when
he
heard
a
carriage
stop
at
the
little
garden
gate
in
a
few
minutes
his
secretary
brought
in
contenson
whom
he
had
run
to
earth
in
a
cafe
not
far
from
where
the
man
was
breakfasting
on
the
strength
of
a
bribe
given
to
him
by
an
imprisoned
debtor
for
certain
allowances
that
must
be
paid
for
contenson
you
must
know
was
a
whole
poem
a
paris
poem
merely
to
see
him
would
have
been
enough
to
tell
you
that
beaumarchais
moliere
s
marivaux
s
and
dancourt
s
those
great
representatives
of
audacious
swindling
of
cunning
driven
to
bay
of
stratagem
rising
again
from
the
ends
of
its
broken
wires
were
all
quite
by
comparison
with
this
giant
of
cleverness
and
meanness
when
in
paris
you
find
a
real
type
he
is
no
longer
a
man
he
is
a
spectacle
no
longer
a
factor
in
life
but
a
whole
life
many
lives
bake
a
plaster
cast
four
times
in
a
furnace
and
you
get
a
sort
of
bastard
imitation
of
florentine
bronze
well
the
thunderbolts
of
numberless
disasters
the
pressure
of
terrible
necessities
had
bronzed
contenson
s
head
as
though
sweating
in
an
oven
had
three
times
over
stained
his
skin
wrinkles
that
could
no
longer
be
relaxed
made
eternal
furrows
whiter
in
their
cracks
the
yellow
face
was
all
wrinkles
the
bald
skull
resembling
voltaire
s
was
as
parched
as
a
death
and
but
for
a
few
hairs
at
the
back
it
would
have
seemed
doubtful
whether
it
was
that
of
a
living
man
under
a
rigid
brow
a
pair
of
chinese
eyes
like
those
of
an
image
under
a
glass
shade
in
a
artificial
eyes
which
sham
life
but
never
vary
moved
but
expressed
nothing
the
nose
as
flat
as
that
of
a
skull
sniffed
at
fate
and
the
mouth
as
as
a
miser
s
was
always
open
but
as
expressionless
as
the
grin
of
a
letterbox
contenson
as
apathetic
as
a
savage
with
sunburned
hands
affected
that
indifference
which
can
never
bend
to
any
formality
of
respect
and
what
a
commentary
on
his
life
was
written
on
his
dress
for
any
one
who
can
decipher
a
dress
above
all
what
trousers
made
by
long
wear
as
black
and
shiny
as
the
camlet
of
which
lawyers
gowns
are
made
a
waistcoat
bought
in
an
old
clothes
shop
in
the
temple
with
a
deep
embroidered
collar
a
rusty
black
coat
and
everything
well
brushed
clean
after
a
fashion
and
graced
by
a
watch
and
an
imitation
gold
chain
contenson
allowed
a
triangle
of
shirt
to
show
with
pleats
in
which
glittered
a
sham
diamond
pin
his
black
velvet
stock
set
stiff
like
a
gorget
over
which
lay
rolls
of
flesh
as
red
as
that
of
a
caribbee
his
silk
hat
was
as
glossy
as
satin
but
the
lining
would
have
yielded
grease
enough
for
two
street
lamps
if
some
grocer
had
bought
it
to
boil
down
but
to
enumerate
these
accessories
is
nothing
if
only
i
could
give
an
idea
of
the
air
of
immense
importance
that
contenson
contrived
to
impart
to
them
there
was
something
indescribably
knowing
in
the
collar
of
his
coat
and
the
fresh
blacking
on
a
pair
of
boots
with
gaping
soles
to
which
no
language
can
do
justice
however
to
give
some
notion
of
this
medley
of
effect
it
may
be
added
that
any
man
of
intelligence
would
have
felt
only
on
seeing
contenson
that
if
instead
of
being
a
spy
he
had
been
a
thief
all
these
odds
and
ends
instead
of
raising
a
smile
would
have
made
one
shudder
with
horror
judging
only
from
his
dress
the
observer
would
have
said
to
himself
that
is
a
scoundrel
he
gambles
he
drinks
he
is
full
of
vices
but
he
does
not
get
drunk
he
does
not
cheat
he
is
neither
a
thief
nor
a
and
contenson
remained
inscrutable
till
the
word
spy
suggested
itself
this
man
had
followed
as
many
unrecognized
trades
as
there
are
recognized
ones
the
sly
smile
on
his
lips
the
twinkle
of
his
green
eyes
the
queer
twitch
of
his
snub
nose
showed
that
he
was
not
deficient
in
humor
he
had
a
face
of
and
his
soul
must
probably
be
like
his
face
every
movement
of
his
countenance
was
a
grimace
wrung
from
him
by
politeness
rather
than
by
any
expression
of
an
inmost
impulse
he
would
have
been
alarming
if
he
had
not
seemed
so
droll
contenson
one
of
the
most
curious
products
of
the
scum
that
rises
to
the
top
of
the
seething
paris
caldron
where
everything
ferments
prided
himself
on
being
above
all
things
a
philosopher
he
would
say
without
any
bitter
feeling
i
have
great
talents
but
of
what
use
are
they
i
might
as
well
have
been
an
and
he
blamed
himself
instead
of
accusing
mankind
find
if
you
can
many
spies
who
have
not
had
more
venom
about
them
than
contenson
had
circumstances
are
against
me
he
would
say
to
his
chiefs
we
might
be
fine
crystal
we
are
but
grains
of
sand
that
is
his
indifference
to
dress
had
some
sense
he
cared
no
more
about
his
everyday
clothes
than
an
actor
does
he
excelled
in
disguising
himself
in
he
could
have
given
frederic
lemaitre
a
lesson
for
he
could
be
a
dandy
when
necessary
formerly
in
his
younger
days
he
must
have
mingled
in
the
society
of
people
living
on
a
humble
scale
he
expressed
excessive
disgust
for
the
criminal
police
corps
for
under
the
empire
he
had
belonged
to
fouche
s
police
and
looked
upon
him
as
a
great
man
since
the
suppression
of
this
government
department
he
had
devoted
his
energies
to
the
tracking
of
commercial
defaulters
but
his
talents
and
acumen
made
him
a
valuable
auxiliary
and
the
unrecognized
chiefs
of
the
political
police
had
kept
his
name
on
their
lists
contenson
like
his
fellows
was
only
a
super
in
the
dramas
of
which
the
leading
parts
were
played
by
his
chief
when
a
political
investigation
was

nucingen

bad

said
contenson
when

contenson
imperturbably

the

the

said
contenson
holding
out
his

noting

contenson
began
to
laugh
to
be
sure
you
have
a
right
to
think
that
of
me
said
he
with
an
air
of
blaming
himself
the
more
rascally
our
business
is
the
more
honesty
is
necessary
but
look

monsieur
le
baron

i
will
give

a
bit
of
gif
it
and
trust

i
will
risk

contenson
said
but
it
is
playing
high
in
such
matters
you
see
we
have
to
work
underground
you
say
quick
march
you
are
rich
you
think
that
money
can
do
everything
well
money
is
something
no
doubt
still
money
can
only
buy
men
as
the
two
or
three
best
heads
in
our
force
so
often
say
and
there
are
many
things
you
would
never
think
of
which
money
can
not
you
can
not
buy
good
luck
so
good
police
work
is
not
done
in
this
style
will
you
show
yourself
in
a
carriage
with
me
we
should
be
seen
chance
is
just
as
often
for
us
as
against
said
the
baron
why
of
course
sir
a
horseshoe
picked
up
in
the
street
led
the
chief
of
the
police
to
the
discovery
of
the
infernal
machine
well
if
we
were
to
go
in
a
hackney
coach
to
monsieur
de
he
would
not
like
to
see
you
walk
in
any
more
than
you
would
like
to
be
seen
going
dat
is
true
said
the
baron
ah
he
is
the
greatest
of
the
great
such
another
as
the
famous
corentin
fouche
s
right
arm
who
was
some
say
his
natural
son
born
while
he
was
still
a
priest
but
that
is
nonsense
fouche
knew
how
to
be
a
priest
as
he
knew
how
to
be
a
minister
well
you
will
not
get
this
man
to
do
anything
for
you
you
see
for
less
than
ten
notes
think
of
but
he
will
do
the
job
and
do
it
well
neither
seen
nor
heard
as
they
say
i
ought
to
give
monsieur
de
notice
and
he
will
fix
a
time
for
your
meeting
in
some
place
where
no
one
can
see
or
hear
for
it
is
a
dangerous
game
to
play
policeman
for
private
interests
still
what
is
to
be
said
he
is
a
good
fellow
the
king
of
good
fellows
and
a
man
who
has
undergone
much
persecution
and
for
having
saving
his
country
too
like
me
like
all
who
helped
to
save
vell
den
write
and
name
de
happy
day
said
the
baron
smiling
at
his
humble
jest
and
monsieur
le
baron
will
allow
me
to
drink
his
health
said
contenson
with
a
manner
at
once
cringing
and
threatening
shean
cried
the
baron
to
the
gardener
go
and
tell
chorge
to
sent
me
one
twenty
francs
and
pring
dem
to
me
still
monsieur
le
baron
if
you
have
no
more
information
than
you
have
just
given
me
i
doubt
whether
the
great
man
can
be
of
any
use
to
i
know
off
oders
replied
the
baron
with
a
cunning
look
i
have
the
honor
to
bid
you
monsieur
le
baron
said
contenson
taking
the
piece
i
shall
have
the
honor
of
calling
again
to
tell
georges
where
you
are
to
go
this
evening
for
we
never
write
anything
in
such
cases
when
they
are
well
it
is
funny
how
sharp
dese
rascals
are
said
the
baron
to
himself
it
is
de
same
mit
de
police
as
it
is
in
buss
when
he
left
the
baron
contenson
went
quietly
from
the
rue
to
the
rue
as
far
as
the
cafe
david
he
looked
in
through
the
windows
and
saw
an
old
man
who
was
known
there
by
the
name
of
le
pere
canquoelle
the
cafe
david
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
monnaie
and
the
rue
enjoyed
a
certain
celebrity
during
the
first
thirty
years
of
the
century
though
its
fame
was
limited
to
the
quarter
known
as
that
of
the
bourdonnais
here
certain
old
retired
merchants
and
large
shopkeepers
still
in
trade
were
wont
to
meet
the
camusots
the
lebas
the
pilleraults
the
popinots
and
a
few
like
little
old
molineux
now
and
again
old
guillaume
might
be
seen
there
coming
from
the
rue
du
colombier
politics
were
discussed
in
a
quiet
way
but
cautiously
for
the
opinions
of
the
cafe
david
were
liberal
the
gossip
of
the
neighborhood
was
repeated
men
so
urgently
feel
the
need
of
laughing
at
each
other
this
cafe
like
all
cafes
for
that
matter
had
its
eccentric
character
in
the
person
of
the
said
pere
canquoelle
who
had
been
regular
in
his
attendance
there
since
and
who
seemed
to
be
so
completely
in
harmony
with
the
good
folks
who
assembled
there
that
they
all
talked
politics
in
his
presence
without
reserve
sometimes
this
old
fellow
whose
guilelessness
was
the
subject
of
much
laughter
to
the
customers
would
disappear
for
a
month
or
two
but
his
absence
never
surprised
anybody
and
was
always
attributed
to
his
infirmities
or
his
great
age
for
he
looked
more
than
sixty
in
what
has
become
of
old
canquoelle
one
or
another
would
ask
of
the
manageress
at
the
desk
i
quite
expect
that
one
fine
day
we
shall
read
in
the
that
he
is
dead
she
would
reply
old
canquoelle
bore
a
perpetual
certificate
of
his
native
province
in
his
accent
he
spoke
of
a
statue
the
people
and
said
for
his
name
was
that
of
a
tiny
estate
called
les
canquoelles
a
word
meaning
cockchafer
in
some
districts
situated
in
the
department
of
vaucluse
whence
he
had
come
at
last
every
one
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
calling
him
canquoelle
instead
of
des
canquoelles
and
the
old
man
took
no
offence
for
in
his
opinion
the
nobility
had
perished
in
and
besides
the
land
of
les
canquoelles
did
not
belong
to
him
he
was
a
younger
son
s
younger
son
nowadays
old
canquoelle
s
costume
would
look
strange
but
between
and
it
astonished
no
one
the
old
man
wore
shoes
with
buckles
silk
stockings
with
stripes
round
the
leg
alternately
blue
and
white
corded
silk
with
oval
buckles
cut
to
match
those
on
his
shoes
a
white
embroidered
waistcoat
an
old
coat
of
with
metal
buttons
and
a
shirt
with
a
frill
completed
his
costume
in
the
middle
of
the
twinkled
a
small
gold
locket
in
which
might
be
seen
under
glass
a
little
temple
worked
in
hair
one
of
those
pathetic
trifles
which
give
men
confidence
just
as
a
scarecrow
frightens
sparrows
most
men
like
other
animals
are
frightened
or
reassured
by
trifles
old
canquoelle
s
breeches
were
kept
in
place
by
a
buckle
which
in
the
fashion
of
the
last
century
tightened
them
across
the
stomach
from
the
belt
hung
on
each
side
a
short
steel
chain
composed
of
several
finer
chains
and
ending
in
a
bunch
of
seals
his
white
neckcloth
was
fastened
behind
by
a
small
gold
buckle
finally
on
his
snowy
and
powdered
hair
he
still
in
wore
the
municipal
cocked
hat
which
monsieur
try
the
president
of
the
law
courts
also
used
to
wear
but
pere
canquoelle
had
recently
substituted
for
this
hat
so
dear
to
old
men
the
undignified
which
no
one
dares
to
rebel
against
the
good
man
thought
he
owed
so
much
as
this
to
the
spirit
of
the
age
a
small
pigtail
tied
with
a
ribbon
had
traced
a
semicircle
on
the
back
of
his
coat
the
greasy
mark
being
hidden
by
powder
if
you
looked
no
further
than
the
most
conspicuous
feature
of
his
face
a
nose
covered
with
excrescences
red
and
swollen
enough
to
figure
in
a
dish
of
truffles
you
might
have
inferred
that
the
worthy
man
had
an
easy
temper
foolish
and
that
of
a
perfect
gaby
and
you
would
have
been
deceived
like
all
at
the
cafe
david
where
no
one
had
ever
remarked
the
studious
brow
the
sardonic
mouth
and
the
cold
eyes
of
this
old
man
petted
by
his
vices
and
as
calm
as
vitellius
whose
imperial
and
portly
stomach
reappeared
in
him
palingenetically
so
to
speak
in
a
young
commercial
traveler
named
gaudissart
who
frequented
the
cafe
david
sat
drinking
from
eleven
o
clock
till
midnight
with
a
officer
he
was
so
rash
as
to
discuss
a
conspiracy
against
the
bourbons
a
rather
serious
plot
then
on
the
point
of
execution
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
in
the
cafe
but
pere
canquoelle
who
seemed
to
be
asleep
two
waiters
who
were
dozing
and
the
accountant
at
the
desk
within
hours
gaudissart
was
arrested
the
plot
was
discovered
two
men
perished
on
the
scaffold
neither
gaudissart
nor
any
one
else
ever
suspected
that
worthy
old
canquoelle
of
having
peached
the
waiters
were
dismissed
for
a
year
they
were
all
on
their
guard
and
afraid
of
the
police
as
pere
canquoelle
was
too
indeed
he
talked
of
retiring
from
the
cafe
david
such
horror
had
he
of
the
police
contenson
went
into
the
cafe
asked
for
a
glass
of
brandy
and
did
not
look
at
canquoelle
who
sat
reading
the
papers
but
when
he
had
gulped
down
the
brandy
he
took
out
the
baron
s
gold
piece
and
called
the
waiter
by
rapping
three
short
raps
on
the
table
the
lady
at
the
desk
and
the
waiter
examined
the
coin
with
a
minute
care
that
was
not
flattering
to
contenson
but
their
suspicions
were
justified
by
the
astonishment
produced
on
all
the
regular
customers
by
contenson
s
appearance
was
that
gold
got
by
theft
or
by
murder
this
was
the
idea
that
rose
to
some
clear
and
shrewd
minds
as
they
looked
at
contenson
over
their
spectacles
while
affecting
to
read
the
news
contenson
who
saw
everything
and
never
was
surprised
at
anything
scornfully
wiped
his
lips
with
a
bandana
in
which
there
were
but
three
darns
took
his
change
slipped
all
the
coppers
into
his
side
pocket
of
which
the
lining
once
white
was
now
as
black
as
the
cloth
of
the
trousers
and
did
not
leave
one
for
the
waiter
what
a
said
pere
canquoelle
to
his
neighbor
monsieur
pillerault
pshaw
said
monsieur
camusot
to
all
the
company
for
he
alone
had
expressed
no
astonishment
it
is
contenson
louchard
s
man
the
police
agent
we
employ
in
business
the
rascals
want
to
nab
some
one
who
is
hanging
about
it
would
seem
necessary
to
explain
here
the
terrible
and
profoundly
cunning
man
who
was
hidden
under
the
guise
of
pere
canquoelle
as
vautrin
was
hidden
under
that
of
the
abbe
carlos
born
at
canquoelles
the
only
possession
of
his
family
which
was
highly
respectable
this
southerner
s
name
was
peyrade
he
belonged
in
fact
to
the
younger
branch
of
the
peyrade
family
an
old
but
impoverished
house
of
franche
comte
still
owning
the
little
estate
of
la
peyrade
the
seventh
child
of
his
father
he
had
come
on
foot
to
paris
in
at
the
age
of
seventeen
with
two
crowns
of
six
francs
in
his
pocket
prompted
by
the
vices
of
an
ardent
spirit
and
the
coarse
desire
to
get
on
which
brings
so
many
men
to
paris
from
the
south
as
soon
as
they
understand
that
their
father
s
property
can
never
supply
them
with
means
to
gratify
their
passions
it
is
enough
to
say
of
peyrade
s
youth
that
in
he
was
in
the
confidence
of
chiefs
of
the
police
and
the
hero
of
the
department
highly
esteemed
by
mm
lenoir
and
d
albert
the
last
of
police
the
revolution
had
no
police
it
needed
none
espionage
though
common
enough
was
called
public
spirit
the
directorate
a
rather
more
regular
government
than
that
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
was
obliged
to
reorganize
the
police
and
the
first
consul
completed
the
work
by
instituting
a
prefect
of
police
and
a
department
of
police
supervision
peyrade
a
man
knowing
the
traditions
collected
the
force
with
the
assistance
of
a
man
named
corentin
a
far
cleverer
man
than
peyrade
though
younger
but
he
was
a
genius
only
in
the
subterranean
ways
of
police
inquiries
in
the
great
services
peyrade
was
able
to
achieve
were
rewarded
by
an
appointment
to
the
eminent
position
of
chief
commissioner
of
police
at
antwerp
in
napoleon
s
mind
this
sort
of
police
governorship
was
equivalent
to
a
minister
s
post
with
the
duty
of
superintending
holland
at
the
end
of
the
campaign
of
peyrade
was
removed
from
antwerp
by
an
order
in
council
from
the
emperor
carried
in
a
chaise
to
paris
between
two
gendarmes
and
imprisoned
in
la
force
two
months
later
he
was
let
out
on
bail
furnished
by
his
friend
corentin
after
having
been
subjected
to
three
examinations
each
lasting
six
hours
in
the
office
of
the
head
of
the
police
did
peyrade
owe
his
overthrow
to
the
miraculous
energy
he
displayed
in
aiding
fouche
in
the
defence
of
the
french
coast
when
threatened
by
what
was
known
at
the
time
as
the
walcheren
expedition
when
the
duke
of
otranto
manifested
such
abilities
as
alarmed
the
emperor
fouche
thought
it
probable
even
then
and
now
when
everybody
knows
what
went
on
in
the
cabinet
council
called
together
by
cambaceres
it
is
absolutely
certain
the
ministers
thunderstruck
by
the
news
of
england
s
attempt
a
retaliation
on
napoleon
for
the
boulogne
expedition
and
taken
by
surprise
when
the
master
was
entrenched
in
the
island
of
lobau
where
all
europe
believed
him
to
be
lost
had
not
an
idea
which
way
to
turn
the
general
opinion
was
in
favor
of
sending
post
haste
to
the
emperor
fouche
alone
was
bold
enough
to
sketch
a
plan
of
campaign
which
in
fact
he
carried
into
execution
do
as
you
please
said
cambaceres
but
i
who
prefer
to
keep
my
head
on
my
shoulders
shall
send
a
report
to
the
it
is
well
known
that
the
emperor
on
his
return
found
an
absurd
pretext
at
a
full
meeting
of
the
council
of
state
for
discarding
his
minister
and
punishing
him
for
having
saved
france
without
the
sovereign
s
help
from
that
time
forth
napoleon
had
doubled
the
hostility
of
prince
de
talleyrand
and
the
duke
of
otranto
the
only
two
great
politicians
formed
by
the
revolution
who
might
perhaps
have
been
able
to
save
napoleon
in
to
get
rid
of
peyrade
he
was
simply
accused
of
connivance
in
favoring
smuggling
and
sharing
certain
profits
with
the
great
merchants
such
an
indignity
was
hard
on
a
man
who
had
earned
the
marshal
s
baton
of
the
police
department
by
the
great
services
he
had
done
this
man
who
had
grown
old
in
active
business
knew
all
the
secrets
of
every
government
since
when
he
had
entered
the
service
the
emperor
who
believed
himself
powerful
enough
to
create
men
for
his
own
uses
paid
no
heed
to
the
representations
subsequently
laid
before
him
in
favor
of
a
man
who
was
reckoned
as
one
of
the
most
trustworthy
most
capable
and
most
acute
of
the
unknown
genii
whose
task
it
is
to
watch
over
the
safety
of
a
state
he
thought
he
could
put
contenson
in
peyrade
s
place
but
contenson
was
at
that
time
employed
by
corentin
for
his
own
benefit
peyrade
felt
the
blow
all
the
more
keenly
because
being
greedy
and
a
libertine
he
had
found
himself
with
regard
to
women
in
the
position
of
a
who
loves
sweetmeats
his
habits
of
vice
had
become
to
him
a
second
nature
he
could
not
live
without
a
good
dinner
without
gambling
in
short
without
the
life
of
an
unpretentious
fine
gentleman
in
which
men
of
powerful
faculties
so
generally
indulge
when
they
have
allowed
excessive
dissipation
to
become
a
necessity
hitherto
he
had
lived
in
style
without
ever
being
expected
to
entertain
and
living
well
for
no
one
ever
looked
for
a
return
from
him
or
from
his
friend
corentin
he
was
cynically
witty
and
he
liked
his
profession
he
was
a
philosopher
and
besides
a
spy
whatever
grade
he
may
hold
in
the
machinery
of
the
police
can
no
more
return
to
a
profession
regarded
as
honorable
or
liberal
than
a
prisoner
from
the
hulks
can
once
branded
once
matriculated
spies
and
convicts
like
deacons
have
assumed
an
indelible
character
there
are
beings
on
whom
social
conditions
impose
an
inevitable
fate
peyrade
for
his
further
woe
was
very
fond
of
a
pretty
little
girl
whom
he
knew
to
be
his
own
child
by
a
celebrated
actress
to
whom
he
had
done
a
signal
service
and
who
for
three
months
had
been
grateful
to
him
peyrade
who
had
sent
for
his
child
from
antwerp
now
found
himself
without
employment
in
paris
and
with
no
means
beyond
a
pension
of
twelve
hundred
francs
a
year
allowed
him
by
the
police
department
as
lenoir
s
old
disciple
he
took
lodgings
in
the
rue
des
moineaux
on
the
fourth
floor
five
little
rooms
at
a
rent
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
if
any
man
should
be
aware
of
the
uses
and
sweets
of
friendship
is
it
not
the
moral
leper
known
to
the
world
as
a
spy
to
the
mob
as
a
to
the
department
as
an
agent
peyrade
and
corentin
were
such
friends
as
orestes
and
pylades
peyrade
had
trained
corentin
as
vien
trained
david
but
the
pupil
soon
surpassed
his
master
they
had
carried
out
more
than
one
undertaking
together
peyrade
happy
at
having
discerned
corentin
s
superior
abilities
had
started
him
in
his
career
by
preparing
a
success
for
him
he
obliged
his
disciple
to
make
use
of
a
mistress
who
had
scorned
him
as
a
bait
to
catch
a
man
see
and
corentin
at
that
time
was
hardly
corentin
who
had
been
retained
as
one
of
the
generals
of
whom
the
minister
of
police
is
the
high
constable
still
held
under
the
duc
de
rovigo
the
high
position
he
had
filled
under
the
duke
of
otranto
now
at
that
time
the
general
police
and
the
criminal
police
were
managed
on
similar
principles
when
any
important
business
was
on
hand
an
account
was
opened
as
it
were
for
the
three
four
five
really
capable
agents
the
minister
on
being
warned
of
some
plot
by
whatever
means
would
say
to
one
of
his
colonels
of
the
police
force
how
much
will
you
want
to
achieve
this
or
that
result
corentin
or
contenson
would
go
into
the
matter
and
reply
twenty
thirty
or
forty
thousand
then
as
soon
as
the
order
was
given
to
go
ahead
all
the
means
and
the
men
were
left
to
the
judgment
of
corentin
or
the
agent
selected
and
the
criminal
police
used
to
act
in
the
same
way
to
discover
crimes
with
the
famous
vidocq
both
branches
of
the
police
chose
their
men
chiefly
from
among
the
ranks
of
agents
who
have
matriculated
in
the
business
and
are
as
it
were
as
soldiers
of
the
secret
army
so
indispensable
to
a
government
in
spite
of
the
public
orations
of
philanthropists
or
moralists
but
the
absolute
confidence
placed
in
two
men
of
the
temper
of
peyrade
and
corentin
conveyed
to
them
the
right
of
employing
perfect
strangers
under
the
risk
moreover
of
being
responsible
to
the
minister
in
all
serious
cases
peyrade
s
experience
and
acumen
were
too
valuable
to
corentin
who
after
the
storm
of
had
blown
over
employed
his
old
friend
constantly
consulted
him
and
contributed
largely
to
his
maintenance
corentin
managed
to
put
about
a
thousand
francs
a
month
into
peyrade
s
hands
peyrade
on
his
part
did
corentin
good
service
in
corentin
on
the
strength
of
the
discovery
of
the
conspiracy
in
which
the
bonapartist
gaudissart
was
implicated
tried
to
get
peyrade
reinstated
in
his
place
in
the
police
office
but
some
unknown
influence
was
working
against
peyrade
this
was
the
reason
why
in
their
anxiety
to
make
themselves
necessary
peyrade
corentin
and
contenson
at
the
duke
of
otranto
s
instigation
had
organized
for
the
benefit
of
louis
xviii
a
sort
of
opposition
police
in
which
very
capable
agents
were
employed
louis
xviii
died
possessed
of
secrets
which
will
remain
secrets
from
the
best
informed
historians
the
struggle
between
the
general
police
of
the
kingdom
and
the
king
s
opposition
police
led
to
many
horrible
disasters
of
which
a
certain
number
of
executions
sealed
the
secrets
this
is
neither
the
place
nor
the
occasion
for
entering
into
details
on
this
subject
for
these
scenes
of
paris
life
are
not
scenes
of
political
enough
has
been
said
to
show
what
were
the
means
of
living
of
the
man
who
at
the
cafe
david
was
known
as
good
old
canquoelle
and
by
what
threads
he
was
tied
to
the
terrible
and
mysterious
powers
of
the
police
between
and
corentin
contenson
peyrade
and
their
myrmidons
were
often
required
to
keep
watch
over
the
minister
of
police
himself
this
perhaps
explains
why
the
minister
declined
to
employ
peyrade
and
contenson
on
whom
corentin
contrived
to
cast
the
minister
s
suspicions
in
order
to
be
able
to
make
use
of
his
friend
when
his
reinstatement
was
evidently
out
of
the
question
the
ministry
put
their
faith
in
corentin
they
enjoined
him
to
keep
an
eye
on
peyrade
which
amused
louis
xviii
corentin
and
peyrade
were
then
masters
of
the
position
contenson
long
attached
to
peyrade
was
still
at
his
service
he
had
joined
the
force
of
the
commercial
police
the
gardes
du
commerce
by
his
friend
s
orders
and
in
fact
as
a
result
of
the
sort
of
zeal
that
is
inspired
by
a
profession
we
love
these
two
chiefs
liked
to
place
their
best
men
in
those
posts
where
information
was
most
likely
to
flow
in
and
indeed
contenson
s
vices
and
dissipated
habits
which
had
dragged
him
lower
than
his
two
friends
consumed
so
much
money
that
he
needed
a
great
deal
of
business
contenson
without
committing
any
indiscretion
had
told
louchard
that
he
knew
the
only
man
who
was
capable
of
doing
what
the
baron
de
nucingen
required
peyrade
was
in
fact
the
only
who
could
act
on
behalf
of
a
private
individual
with
impunity
at
the
death
of
louis
peyrade
had
not
only
ceased
to
be
of
consequence
but
had
lost
the
profits
of
his
position
as
to
his
majesty
believing
himself
to
be
indispensable
he
had
lived
fast
women
high
feeding
and
the
club
the
des
had
prevented
this
man
from
saving
and
like
all
men
cut
out
for
debauchery
he
enjoyed
an
iron
constitution
but
between
and
when
he
was
nearly
years
of
age
he
had
stuck
to
use
his
own
expression
year
by
year
he
saw
his
comforts
dwindling
he
followed
the
police
department
to
its
grave
and
saw
with
regret
that
charles
s
government
was
departing
from
its
good
old
traditions
every
session
saw
the
estimates
pared
down
which
were
necessary
to
keep
up
the
police
out
of
hatred
for
that
method
of
government
and
a
firm
determination
to
reform
that
institution
it
is
as
if
they
thought
they
could
cook
in
white
gloves
said
peyrade
to
corentin
in
this
couple
foresaw
they
knew
how
bitterly
louis
xviii
hated
his
successor
which
accounts
for
his
recklessness
with
regard
to
the
younger
branch
and
without
which
his
reign
would
be
an
unanswerable
riddle
as
peyrade
grew
older
his
love
for
his
natural
daughter
had
increased
for
her
sake
he
had
adopted
his
citizen
guise
for
he
intended
that
his
lydie
should
marry
respectably
so
for
the
last
three
years
he
had
been
especially
anxious
to
find
a
corner
either
at
the
prefecture
of
police
or
in
the
general
police
office
some
ostensible
and
recognized
post
he
had
ended
by
inventing
a
place
of
which
the
necessity
as
he
told
corentin
would
sooner
or
later
be
felt
he
was
anxious
to
create
an
inquiry
office
at
the
prefecture
of
police
to
be
intermediate
between
the
paris
police
in
the
strictest
sense
the
criminal
police
and
the
superior
general
police
so
as
to
enable
the
supreme
board
to
profit
by
the
various
scattered
forces
no
one
but
peyrade
at
his
age
and
after
years
of
confidential
work
could
be
the
connecting
link
between
the
three
branches
of
the
police
or
the
keeper
of
the
records
to
whom
political
and
judicial
authority
alike
could
apply
for
the
elucidation
of
certain
cases
by
this
means
peyrade
hoped
with
corentin
s
assistance
to
find
a
husband
and
scrape
together
a
portion
for
his
little
lydie
corentin
had
already
mentioned
the
matter
to
the
of
the
police
forces
of
the
realm
without
naming
peyrade
and
the
a
man
from
the
south
thought
it
necessary
that
the
suggestion
should
come
from
the
chief
of
the
city
police
at
the
moment
when
contenson
struck
three
raps
on
the
table
with
the
gold
piece
a
signal
conveying
i
want
to
speak
to
you
the
senior
was
reflecting
on
this
problem
by
whom
and
under
what
pressure
can
the
prefet
of
police
be
made
to
move
and
he
looked
like
a
noodle
studying
his
poor
fouche
thought
he
to
himself
as
he
made
his
way
along
the
rue
that
great
man
is
dead
our
with
louis
xviii
are
out
of
favor
and
besides
as
corentin
said
only
yesterday
nobody
believes
in
the
activity
or
the
intelligence
of
a
man
of
seventy
oh
why
did
i
get
into
a
habit
of
dining
at
very
s
of
drinking
choice
wines
of
singing
mere
of
gambling
when
i
am
in
funds
to
get
a
place
and
keep
it
as
corentin
says
it
is
not
enough
to
be
clever
you
must
have
the
gift
of
management
poor
dear
lenoir
was
right
when
he
wrote
to
me
in
the
matter
of
the
queen
s
necklace
you
will
never
do
any
good
when
he
heard
that
i
did
not
stay
under
that
slut
oliva
s
if
the
venerable
pere
canquoelle
he
was
called
so
in
the
house
lived
on
in
the
rue
des
moineaux
on
a
fourth
floor
you
may
depend
on
it
he
had
found
some
peculiarity
in
the
arrangement
of
the
premises
which
favored
the
practice
of
his
terrible
profession
the
house
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
had
no
neighbors
on
one
side
and
as
the
staircase
up
the
middle
divided
it
into
two
there
were
on
each
floor
two
perfectly
isolated
rooms
those
two
rooms
looked
out
on
the
rue
there
were
garret
rooms
above
the
fourth
floor
one
of
them
a
kitchen
and
the
other
a
bedroom
for
pere
canquoelle
s
only
servant
a
fleming
named
katt
formerly
lydie
s
old
canquoelle
had
taken
one
of
the
outside
rooms
for
his
bedroom
and
the
other
for
his
study
the
study
ended
at
the
a
very
thick
one
the
window
opening
on
the
rue
des
moineaux
looked
on
a
blank
wall
at
the
opposite
corner
as
this
study
was
divided
from
the
stairs
by
the
whole
width
of
peyrade
s
bedroom
the
friends
feared
no
eye
no
ear
as
they
talked
business
in
this
study
made
on
purpose
for
his
detestable
trade
peyrade
as
a
further
precaution
had
furnished
katt
s
room
with
a
thick
straw
bed
a
felt
carpet
and
a
very
heavy
rug
under
the
pretext
of
making
his
child
s
nurse
comfortable
he
had
also
stopped
up
the
chimney
warming
his
room
by
a
stove
with
a
pipe
through
the
wall
to
the
rue
finally
he
laid
several
rugs
on
his
floor
to
prevent
the
slightest
sound
being
heard
by
the
neighbors
beneath
an
expert
himself
in
the
tricks
of
spies
he
sounded
the
outer
wall
the
ceiling
and
the
floor
once
a
week
examining
them
as
if
he
were
in
search
of
noxious
insects
it
was
the
security
of
this
room
from
all
witnesses
or
listeners
that
had
made
corentin
select
it
as
his
when
he
did
not
hold
a
meeting
in
his
own
room
where
corentin
lived
was
known
to
no
one
but
the
chief
of
the
superior
police
and
to
peyrade
he
received
there
such
personages
as
the
ministry
or
the
king
selected
to
conduct
very
serious
cases
but
no
agent
or
subordinate
ever
went
there
and
he
plotted
everything
connected
with
their
business
at
peyrade
s
in
this
unpretentious
room
schemes
were
matured
and
resolutions
passed
which
would
have
furnished
strange
records
and
curious
dramas
if
only
walls
could
talk
between
and
the
highest
interests
were
discussed
there
there
first
germinated
the
events
which
grew
to
weigh
on
france
there
peyrade
and
corentin
with
all
the
foresight
and
more
than
all
the
information
of
bellart
the
had
said
even
in
if
louis
xviii
does
not
consent
to
strike
such
or
such
a
blow
to
make
away
with
such
or
such
a
prince
is
it
because
he
hates
his
brother
he
must
wish
to
leave
him
heir
to
a
peyrade
s
door
was
graced
with
a
slate
on
which
very
strange
marks
might
sometimes
be
seen
figures
scrawled
in
chalk
this
sort
of
devil
s
algebra
bore
the
clearest
meaning
to
the
initiated
lydie
s
rooms
opposite
to
peyrade
s
shabby
lodging
consisted
of
an
a
little
a
bedroom
and
a
small
the
door
like
that
of
peyrade
s
room
was
constructed
of
a
plate
of
three
lines
thick
sandwiched
between
two
strong
oak
planks
fitted
with
locks
and
elaborate
hinges
making
it
as
impossible
to
force
it
as
if
it
were
a
prison
door
thus
though
the
house
had
a
public
passage
through
it
with
a
shop
below
and
no
doorkeeper
lydie
lived
there
without
a
fear
the
the
little
and
her
bedroom
every
a
hanging
garden
were
luxurious
in
their
dutch
cleanliness
the
flemish
nurse
had
never
left
lydie
whom
she
called
her
daughter
the
two
went
to
church
with
a
regularity
that
gave
the
royalist
grocer
who
lived
below
in
the
corner
shop
an
excellent
opinion
of
the
worthy
canquoelle
the
grocer
s
family
kitchen
and
occupied
the
first
floor
and
the
entresol
the
landlord
inhabited
the
second
floor
and
the
third
had
been
let
for
twenty
years
past
to
a
lapidary
each
resident
had
a
key
of
the
street
door
the
grocer
s
wife
was
all
the
more
willing
to
receive
letters
and
parcels
addressed
to
these
three
quiet
households
because
the
grocer
s
shop
had
a
without
these
details
strangers
or
even
those
who
know
paris
well
could
not
have
understood
the
privacy
and
quietude
the
isolation
and
safety
which
made
this
house
exceptional
in
paris
after
midnight
pere
canquoelle
could
hatch
plots
receive
spies
or
ministers
wives
or
hussies
without
any
one
on
earth
knowing
anything
about
it
peyrade
of
whom
the
flemish
woman
would
say
to
the
grocer
s
cook
he
would
not
hurt
a
fly
was
regarded
as
the
best
of
men
he
grudged
his
daughter
nothing
lydie
who
had
been
taught
music
by
schmucke
was
herself
a
musician
capable
of
composing
she
could
wash
in
a
sepia
drawing
and
paint
in
gouache
and
every
sunday
peyrade
dined
at
home
with
her
on
that
day
this
worthy
was
wholly
paternal
lydie
religious
but
not
a
bigot
took
the
sacrament
at
easter
and
confessed
every
month
still
she
allowed
herself
from
time
to
time
to
be
treated
to
the
play
she
walked
in
the
tuileries
when
it
was
fine
these
were
all
her
pleasures
for
she
led
a
sedentary
life
lydie
who
worshiped
her
father
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
his
sinister
gifts
and
dark
employments
not
a
wish
had
ever
disturbed
this
pure
child
s
pure
life
slight
and
handsome
like
her
mother
gifted
with
an
exquisite
voice
and
a
delicate
face
framed
in
fine
fair
hair
she
looked
like
one
of
those
angels
mystical
rather
than
real
which
some
of
the
early
painters
grouped
in
the
background
of
the
holy
family
the
glance
of
her
blue
eyes
seemed
to
bring
a
beam
from
the
sky
on
those
she
favored
with
a
look
her
dress
quite
simple
with
no
exaggeration
of
fashion
had
a
delightful
modesty
picture
to
yourself
an
old
satan
as
the
father
of
an
angel
and
purified
in
her
divine
presence
and
you
will
have
an
idea
of
peyrade
and
his
daughter
if
anybody
had
soiled
this
jewel
her
father
would
have
invented
to
swallow
him
alive
one
of
those
dreadful
plots
in
which
under
the
restoration
the
unhappy
wretches
were
trapped
who
were
designate
to
die
on
the
scaffold
a
thousand
crowns
were
ample
maintenance
for
lydie
and
katt
whom
she
called
nurse
as
peyrade
turned
into
the
rue
des
moineaux
he
saw
contenson
he
outstripped
him
went
upstairs
before
him
heard
the
man
s
steps
on
the
stairs
and
admitted
him
before
the
woman
had
put
her
nose
out
of
the
kitchen
door
a
bell
rung
by
the
opening
of
a
glass
door
on
the
third
story
where
the
lapidary
lived
warned
the
residents
on
that
and
the
fourth
floors
when
a
visitor
was
coming
to
them
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
after
midnight
peyrade
muffled
this
bell
what
is
up
in
such
a
hurry
philosopher
philosopher
was
the
nickname
bestowed
on
contenson
by
peyrade
and
well
merited
by
the
epictetus
among
police
agents
the
name
of
contenson
alas
hid
one
of
the
most
ancient
names
of
feudal
normandy
well
there
is
something
like
ten
thousand
francs
to
be
what
is
it
political
no
a
piece
of
idiocy
baron
de
nucingen
you
know
the
old
certified
swindler
is
neighing
after
a
woman
he
saw
in
the
bois
de
vincennes
and
she
has
got
to
be
found
or
he
will
die
of
they
had
a
consultation
of
doctors
yesterday
by
what
his
man
tells
i
have
already
eased
him
of
a
thousand
francs
under
pretence
of
seeking
the
fair
and
contenson
related
nucingen
s
meeting
with
esther
adding
that
the
baron
had
now
some
further
information
all
right
said
peyrade
we
will
find
his
dulcinea
tell
the
baron
to
come
in
a
carriage
to
the
the
corner
of
the
avenue
de
gabriel
and
the
allee
de
peyrade
saw
contenson
out
and
knocked
at
his
daughter
s
rooms
as
he
always
knocked
to
be
let
in
he
was
full
of
glee
chance
had
just
offered
the
means
at
last
of
getting
the
place
he
longed
for
he
flung
himself
into
a
deep
armchair
after
kissing
lydie
on
the
forehead
and
said
play
me
lydie
played
him
a
composition
for
the
piano
by
beethoven
that
is
very
well
played
my
pet
said
he
taking
lydie
on
his
knees
do
you
know
that
we
are
years
old
we
must
get
married
soon
for
our
old
daddy
is
more
than
seventy
i
am
quite
happy
here
said
she
you
love
no
one
but
your
ugly
old
father
asked
peyrade
why
whom
should
i
love
i
am
dining
at
home
my
darling
go
and
tell
katt
i
am
thinking
of
settling
of
getting
an
appointment
and
finding
a
husband
worthy
of
you
some
good
young
man
very
clever
whom
you
may
some
day
be
proud
of
i
have
never
seen
but
one
yet
that
i
should
have
liked
for
a
husband
you
have
seen
one
then
yes
in
the
tuileries
replied
lydie
he
walked
past
me
he
was
giving
his
arm
to
the
comtesse
de
and
his
name
is
lucien
de
i
was
sitting
with
katt
under
a
thinking
of
nothing
there
were
two
ladies
sitting
by
me
and
one
said
to
the
other
there
are
madame
de
serizy
and
that
handsome
lucien
de
i
looked
at
the
couple
that
the
two
ladies
were
watching
oh
my
dear
said
the
other
some
women
are
very
lucky
that
woman
is
allowed
to
do
everything
she
pleases
just
because
she
was
a
de
ronquerolles
and
her
husband
is
in
but
my
dear
said
the
other
lady
lucien
costs
her
very
what
did
she
mean
papa
just
nonsense
such
as
people
of
fashion
will
talk
replied
peyrade
with
an
air
of
perfect
candor
perhaps
they
were
alluding
to
political
well
in
short
you
asked
me
a
question
so
i
answer
you
if
you
want
me
to
marry
find
me
a
husband
just
like
that
young
silly
child
replied
her
father
the
fact
that
a
man
is
handsome
is
not
always
a
sign
of
goodness
young
men
gifted
with
an
attractive
appearance
meet
with
no
obstacles
at
the
beginning
of
life
so
they
make
no
use
of
any
talent
they
are
corrupted
by
the
advances
made
to
them
by
society
and
they
have
to
pay
interest
later
for
their
attractiveness
what
i
should
like
for
you
is
what
the
middle
classes
the
rich
and
the
fools
leave
unholpen
and
unprotected
what
father
an
unrecognized
man
of
talent
but
there
child
i
have
it
in
my
power
to
hunt
through
every
garret
in
paris
and
carry
out
your
programme
by
offering
for
your
affection
a
man
as
handsome
as
the
young
scamp
you
speak
of
but
a
man
of
promise
with
a
future
before
him
destined
to
glory
and
by
the
way
i
was
forgetting
i
must
have
a
whole
flock
of
nephews
and
among
them
there
must
be
one
worthy
of
you
i
will
write
or
get
some
one
to
write
to
a
strange
coincidence
at
this
moment
a
young
man
of
hunger
and
fatigue
who
had
come
on
foot
from
the
department
of
vaucluse
a
nephew
of
pere
canquoelle
s
in
search
of
his
uncle
was
entering
paris
through
the
barriere
de
l
italie
in
the
of
the
family
ignorant
of
this
uncle
s
fate
peyrade
had
supplied
the
text
for
many
hopes
he
was
supposed
to
have
returned
from
india
with
millions
stimulated
by
these
fireside
romances
this
named
theodore
had
started
on
a
voyage
round
the
world
in
quest
of
this
eccentric
uncle
after
enjoying
for
some
hours
the
joys
of
paternity
peyrade
his
hair
washed
and
dyed
for
his
powder
was
a
disguise
dressed
in
a
stout
coarse
blue
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
and
a
black
cloak
shod
in
strong
boots
furnished
himself
with
a
private
card
and
walked
slowly
along
the
avenue
gabriel
where
contenson
dressed
as
an
old
costermonger
woman
met
him
in
front
of
the
gardens
of
the
monsieur
de
said
contenson
giving
his
old
chief
the
name
he
was
officially
known
by
you
have
put
me
in
the
way
of
making
five
hundred
pieces
francs
but
what
i
came
here
for
was
to
tell
you
that
that
damned
baron
before
he
gave
me
the
shiners
had
been
to
ask
questions
at
the
house
the
prefecture
of
police
i
shall
want
you
no
doubt
replied
peyrade
look
up
numbers
and
we
can
employ
those
men
without
any
one
finding
it
out
either
at
the
police
ministry
or
at
the
contenson
went
back
to
a
post
near
the
carriage
in
which
monsieur
de
nucingen
was
waiting
for
peyrade
i

peyrade
to
the
baron
raising
himself
to
look
over
the
carriage
door

replied
the
baron
ordering
the
coachman
to

slowly
to
the
arc
de
l
etoile
you

been
to
the
prefecture
of
police
monsieur
le
baron
that
was
not
fair

i
ask
what
you
said
to
le
prefet
and
what
he
said
in
reply
asked
peyrade
before

should
gif

to

now
that
you
have
learned
my
true
name
monsieur
le
baron
will
you
tell
me
what
it
is
you
want
when
the
baron
had
given
a
long
and
copious
explanation
in
his
hideous
dialect
of
his
meeting
with
esther
and
the
cry
of
the
man
behind
the
carriage
and
his
vain
efforts
he
ended
by
relating
what
had
occurred
at
his
house
the
night
before
lucien
s
involuntary
smile
and
the
opinion
expressed
by
bianchon
and
some
other
young
dandies
that
there
must
be
some
acquaintance
between
him
and
the
unknown
fair
listen
to
me
monsieur
le
baron
you
must
in
the
first
instance
place
ten
thousand
francs
in
my
hands
on
account
for
expenses
for
to
you
this
is
a
matter
of
life
or
death
and

life

left
undone

at
antwerp
and
now
that
louis
xviii
is
dead
i
may
tell
you
in
confidence
that
for
seven
years
i
was
the
chief
of
his
so
there
is
no
beating
me
down
you
must
understand
monsieur
le
baron
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
any
estimate
of
the
cost
of
each
man
s
conscience
before
going
into
the
details
of
such
an
affair
be
quite
easy
i
shall
succeed
do
not
fancy
that
you
can
satisfy

sum
of
money

strange
suspicions
of

quite
in
a
position
to
obtain

a
place

comte
de

to

in

and

that

echoed
the
baron
vere
shall
i
put
you
at
the
corner
of
the
pont
louis
to
the
pont
de
la
chambre
said
the
baron
to
the
footman
at
the
carriage
door
then
i
am
to
get
dat
unknown
person
said
the
baron
to
himself
as
he
drove
home
what
a
queer
business
thought
peyrade
going
back
on
foot
to
the
where
he
intended
trying
to
multiply
his
ten
thousand
francs
by
three
to
make
a
little
fortune
for
lydie
here
i
am
required
to
look
into
the
private
concerns
of
a
very
young
man
who
has
bewitched
my
little
girl
by
a
glance
he
is
i
suppose
one
of
those
men
who
have
an
eye
for
a
woman
said
he
to
himself
using
an
expression
of
a
language
of
his
own
in
which
his
observations
or
corentin
s
were
summed
up
in
words
that
were
anything
rather
than
classical
but
for
that
very
reason
energetic
and
picturesque
the
baron
de
nucingen
when
he
went
in
was
an
altered
man
he
astonished
his
household
and
his
wife
by
showing
them
a
face
full
of
life
and
color
so
cheerful
did
he
feel
our
shareholders
had
better
look
out
for
themselves
said
du
tillet
to
rastignac
they
were
all
at
tea
in
delphine
de
nucingen
s
boudoir
having
come
in
from
the
opera
ja
said
the
baron
smiling
i
feel
ver
much
dat
i
shall
do
some
then
you
have
seen
the
fair
being
asked
madame
de
nucingen
no
said
he
i
have
only
hoped
to
see
do
men
ever
love
their
wives
so
cried
madame
de
nucingen
feeling
or
affecting
to
feel
a
little
jealous
when
you
have
got
her
you
must
ask
us
to
sup
with
her
said
du
tillet
to
the
baron
for
i
am
very
curious
to
study
the
creature
who
has
made
you
so
young
as
you
she
is
a
of
creation
replied
the
old
banker
he
will
be
swindled
like
a
boy
said
rastignac
in
delphine
s
ear
pooh
he
makes
quite
enough
money
to
to
give
a
little
back
i
suppose
said
du
tillet
interrupting
the
baroness
nucingen
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
as
if
his
legs
had
the
fidgets
now
is
your
time
to
make
him
pay
your
fresh
debts
said
rastignac
in
the
baroness
ear
at
this
very
moment
carlos
was
leaving
the
rue
taitbout
full
of
hope
he
had
been
there
to
give
some
last
advice
to
europe
who
was
to
play
the
principal
part
in
the
farce
devised
to
take
in
the
baron
de
nucingen
he
was
accompanied
as
far
as
the
boulevard
by
lucien
who
was
not
at
all
easy
at
finding
this
demon
so
perfectly
disguised
that
even
he
had
only
recognized
him
by
his
voice
where
the
devil
did
you
find
a
handsomer
woman
than
esther
he
asked
his
evil
genius
my
boy
there
is
no
such
thing
to
be
found
in
paris
such
a
complexion
is
not
made
in
i
assure
you
i
am
still
quite
amazed

not
such
a
figure
a
man
would
lose
his
soul
for
her
but
where
did
she
spring
from
she
was
the
handsomest
girl
in
london
drunk
with
gin
she
killed
her
lover
in
a
fit
of
jealousy
the
lover
was
a
wretch
of
whom
the
london
police
are
well
quit
and
this
woman
was
packed
off
to
paris
for
a
time
to
let
the
matter
blow
over
the
hussy
was
well
brought
up
the
daughter
of
a
clergyman
she
speaks
french
as
if
it
were
her
mother
tongue
she
does
not
know
and
never
will
know
why
she
is
here
she
was
told
that
if
you
took
a
fancy
to
her
she
might
fleece
you
of
millions
but
that
you
were
as
jealous
as
a
tiger
and
she
was
told
how
esther
but
supposing
nucingen
should
prefer
her
to
esther
ah
it
is
out
at
last
cried
carlos
you
dread
now
lest
what
dismayed
you
yesterday
should
not
take
place
after
all
be
quite
easy
that
fair
and
girl
has
blue
eyes
she
is
the
antipodes
of
the
beautiful
jewess
and
only
such
eyes
as
esther
s
could
ever
stir
a
man
so
rotten
as
nucingen
what
the
devil
you
could
not
hide
an
ugly
woman
when
this
puppet
has
played
her
part
i
will
send
her
off
in
safe
custody
to
rome
or
to
madrid
where
she
will
be
the
if
we
have
her
only
for
a
short
time
said
lucien
i
will
go
back
to
her
go
my
boy
amuse
yourself
you
will
be
a
day
older
for
my
part
i
must
wait
for
some
one
whom
i
have
instructed
to
learn
what
is
going
on
at
the
baron
de
nucingen
who
his
valet
s
mistress
for
after
all
we
must
keep
ourselves
informed
at
every
moment
of
what
is
going
on
in
the
enemy
s
at
midnight
paccard
esther
s
tall
chasseur
met
carlos
on
the
pont
des
arts
the
most
favorable
spot
in
all
paris
for
saying
a
few
words
which
no
one
must
overhear
all
the
time
they
talked
the
servant
kept
an
eye
on
one
side
while
his
master
looked
out
on
the
other
the
baron
went
to
the
prefecture
of
police
this
morning
between
four
and
five
said
the
man
and
he
boasted
this
evening
that
he
should
find
the
woman
he
saw
in
the
bois
de
vincennes
he
had
been
promised
it
we
are
watched
said
carlos
by
whom
they
have
already
employed
louchard
the
that
would
be
child
s
play
replied
carlos
we
need
fear
nothing
but
the
guardians
of
public
safety
the
criminal
police
and
so
long
as
that
is
not
set
in
motion
we
can
go
on
that
is
not
what
else
our
chums
of
the
i
saw
lapouraille
yesterday
he
has
choked
off
a
married
couple
and
has
bagged
ten
thousand
pieces
in
he
will
be
nabbed
said
jacques
collin
that
is
the
rue
boucher
what
is
the
order
of
the
day
said
paccard
with
the
respectful
demeanor
a
marshal
must
have
assumed
when
taking
his
orders
from
louis
xviii
you
must
get
out
every
evening
at
ten
o
clock
replied
herrera
make
your
way
pretty
briskly
to
the
bois
de
vincennes
the
bois
de
meudon
and
de
avray
if
any
one
should
follow
you
let
them
do
it
be
free
of
speech
chatty
open
to
a
bribe
talk
about
rubempre
s
jealousy
and
his
mad
passion
for
madame
saying
that
he
would
not
on
any
account
have
it
known
that
he
had
a
mistress
of
that
must
i
have
any
weapons
never
exclaimed
carlos
vehemently
a
weapon
of
what
use
would
that
be
to
get
us
into
a
scrape
do
not
under
any
circumstances
use
your
when
you
know
that
you
can
break
the
strongest
man
s
legs
by
the
trick
i
showed
you
when
you
can
hold
your
own
against
three
armed
warders
feeling
quite
sure
that
you
can
account
for
two
of
them
before
they
have
got
out
flint
and
steel
what
is
there
to
be
afraid
of
have
not
you
your
cane
to
be
sure
said
the
man
paccard
nicknamed
the
old
guard
old
or
the
right
man
a
man
with
legs
of
iron
arms
of
steel
italian
whiskers
hair
like
an
artist
s
a
beard
like
a
sapper
s
and
a
face
as
colorless
and
immovable
as
contenson
s
kept
his
spirit
to
himself
and
rejoiced
in
a
sort
of
appearance
which
disarmed
suspicion
a
fugitive
from
poissy
or
melun
has
no
such
serious
and
belief
in
his
own
merit
as
giafar
to
the
haroun
el
rasheed
of
the
hulks
he
served
him
with
the
friendly
admiration
which
peyrade
felt
for
corentin
this
huge
fellow
with
a
small
body
in
proportion
to
his
legs
and
lean
of
limb
stalked
solemnly
about
on
his
two
long
pins
whenever
his
right
leg
moved
his
right
eye
took
in
everything
around
him
with
the
placid
swiftness
peculiar
to
thieves
and
spies
the
left
eye
followed
the
right
eye
s
example
wiry
nimble
ready
for
anything
at
any
time
but
for
a
weakness
of
dutch
courage
paccard
would
have
been
perfect
jacques
collin
used
to
say
so
completely
was
he
endowed
with
the
talents
indispensable
to
a
man
at
war
with
society
but
the
master
had
succeeded
in
persuading
his
slave
to
drink
only
in
the
evening
on
going
home
at
night
paccard
tippled
the
liquid
gold
poured
into
small
glasses
out
of
a
stone
jar
from
danzig
we
will
make
them
open
their
eyes
said
paccard
putting
on
his
grand
hat
and
feathers
after
bowing
to
carlos
whom
he
called
his
confessor
these
were
the
events
which
had
led
three
men
so
clever
each
in
his
way
as
jacques
collin
peyrade
and
corentin
to
a
fight
on
the
same
ground
each
exerting
his
talents
in
a
struggle
for
his
own
passions
or
interests
it
was
one
of
those
obscure
but
terrible
conflicts
on
which
are
expended
in
marches
and
countermarches
in
strategy
skill
hatred
and
vexation
the
powers
that
might
make
a
fine
fortune
men
and
means
were
kept
absolutely
secret
by
peyarde
seconded
in
this
business
by
his
friend
corentin
a
business
they
thought
but
a
trifle
and
so
as
to
them
history
is
silent
as
it
is
on
the
true
causes
of
many
revolutions
but
this
was
the
result
five
days
after
monsieur
de
nucingen
s
interview
with
peyrade
in
the
champs
elysees
a
man
of
about
fifty
called
in
the
morning
stepping
out
of
a
handsome
cab
and
flinging
the
reins
to
his
servant
he
had
the
complexion
which
a
life
in
the
world
gives
to
diplomates
was
dressed
in
blue
cloth
and
had
a
general
air
of
fashion
almost
that
of
a
minister
of
state
he
inquired
of
the
servant
who
sat
on
a
bench
on
the
steps
whether
the
baron
de
nucingen
were
at
home
and
the
man
respectfully
threw
open
the
splendid
doors
your
name
sir
said
the
footman
tell
the
baron
that
i
have
come
from
the
avenue
gabriel
said
corentin
if
anybody
is
with
him
be
sure
not
to
say
so
too
loud
or
you
will
find
yourself
out
of
place
a
minute
later
the
man
came
back
and
led
corentin
by
the
back
passages
to
the
baron
s
private
room
corentin
and
the
banker
exchanged
impenetrable
glances
and
both
bowed
politely
monsieur
le
baron
said
corentin
i
come
in
the
name
of
peyrade
ver
gott
said
the
baron
fastening
the
bolts
of
both
doors
monsieur
de
rubempre
s
mistress
lives
in
the
rue
taitbout
in
the
apartment
formerly
occupied
by
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
de
granville
s
the
vat
so
near
to
me
exclaimed
the
baron
dat
is
ver
i
can
quite
understand
your
being
crazy
about
that
splendid
creature
it
was
a
pleasure
to
me
to
look
at
her
replied
corentin
lucien
is
so
jealous
of
the
girl
that
he
never
allows
her
to
be
seen
and
she
loves
him
devotedly
for
in
four
years
since
she
succeeded
la
bellefeuille
in
those
rooms
inheriting
her
furniture
and
her
profession
neither
the
neighbors
nor
the
porter
nor
the
other
tenants
in
the
house
have
ever
set
eyes
on
her
my
lady
never
stirs
out
but
at
night
when
she
sets
out
the
blinds
of
the
carriage
are
pulled
down
and
she
is
closely
veiled
lucien
has
other
reasons
besides
jealousy
for
concealing
this
woman
he
is
to
be
married
to
clotilde
de
grandlieu
and
he
is
at
this
moment
madame
de
serizy
s
favorite
fancy
he
naturally
wishes
to
keep
a
hold
on
his
fashionable
mistress
and
on
his
promised
bride
so
you
are
master
of
the
position
for
lucien
will
sacrifice
his
pleasure
to
his
interests
and
his
vanity
you
are
rich
this
is
probably
your
last
chance
of
happiness
be
liberal
you
can
gain
your
end
through
her
give
the
slut
ten
thousand
francs
she
will
hide
you
in
her
mistress
bedroom
it
must
be
quite
worth
that
to
no
figure
of
speech
could
describe
the
short
precise
tone
of
finality
in
which
corentin
spoke
the
baron
could
not
fail
to
observe
it
and
his
face
expressed
his
astonishment
an
expression
he
had
long
expunged
from
his
impenetrable
features
i
have
also
to
ask
you
for
five
thousand
francs
for
my
friend
peyrade
who
has
dropped
five
of
your
notes
a
tiresome
accident
corentin
went
on
in
a
lordly
tone
of
command
peyrade
knows
his
paris
too
well
to
spend
money
in
advertising
and
he
trusts
entirely
to
you
but
this
is
not
the
most
important
point
added
corentin
checking
himself
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
the
request
for
money
seem
quite
a
trifle
if
you
do
not
want
to
end
your
days
miserably
get
the
place
for
peyrade
that
he
asked
you
to
procure
for
him
and
it
is
a
thing
you
can
easily
do
the
chief
of
the
general
police
must
have
had
notice
of
the
matter
yesterday
all
that
is
needed
is
to
get
gondreville
to
speak
to
the
prefet
of
very
well
just
say
to
malin
comte
de
gondreville
that
it
is
to
oblige
one
of
the
men
who
relieved
him
of
mm
de
simeuse
and
he
will
work
it
here
den
mensieur
said
the
baron
taking
out
five
notes
and
handing
them
to
corentin
the
is
great
friends
with
a
tall
chasseur
named
paccard
living
in
the
rue
de
provence
over
a
s
he
goes
out
as
heyduque
to
persons
who
give
themselves
princely
airs
you
can
get
at
madame
van
bogseck
s
woman
through
paccard
a
brawny
piemontese
who
has
a
liking
for
this
information
gracefully
thrown
in
as
a
postscript
was
evidently
the
return
for
the
five
thousand
francs
the
baron
was
trying
to
guess
corentin
s
place
in
life
for
he
quite
understood
that
the
man
was
rather
a
master
of
spies
than
a
spy
himself
but
corentin
remained
to
him
as
mysterious
as
an
inscription
is
to
an
archaeologist
when
of
the
letters
are
missing
vat
is
dat
maid
called
he
asked
eugenie
replied
corentin
who
bowed
and
withdrew
the
baron
in
a
transport
of
joy
left
his
business
for
the
day
shut
up
his
office
and
went
up
to
his
rooms
in
the
happy
frame
of
mind
of
a
young
man
of
twenty
looking
forward
to
his
first
meeting
with
his
first
mistress
the
baron
took
all
the
notes
out
of
his
private
a
sum
sufficient
to
make
the
whole
village
happy
thousand
francs
and
stuffed
them
into
the
pocket
of
his
coat
but
a
millionaire
s
lavishness
can
only
be
compared
with
his
eagerness
for
gain
as
soon
as
a
whim
or
a
passion
is
to
be
gratified
money
is
dross
to
a
croesus
in
fact
he
finds
it
harder
to
have
whims
than
gold
a
keen
pleasure
is
the
rarest
thing
in
these
satiated
lives
full
of
the
excitement
that
comes
of
great
strokes
of
speculation
in
which
these
hearts
have
burned
themselves
out
for
instance
one
of
the
richest
capitalists
in
paris
one
day
met
an
extremely
pretty
little
her
mother
was
with
her
but
the
girl
had
taken
the
arm
of
a
young
fellow
in
very
doubtful
finery
with
a
very
smart
swagger
the
millionaire
fell
in
love
with
the
girl
at
first
sight
he
followed
her
home
he
went
in
he
heard
all
her
story
a
record
of
alternations
of
dancing
at
mabille
and
days
of
starvation
of
and
hard
work
he
took
an
interest
in
it
and
left
five
notes
under
a
piece
an
act
of
generosity
abused
next
day
a
famous
upholsterer
braschon
came
to
take
the
damsel
s
orders
furnished
rooms
that
she
had
chosen
and
laid
out
twenty
thousand
francs
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
wildest
hopes
dressed
her
mother
to
match
and
flattered
herself
she
would
find
a
place
for
her
in
an
insurance
office
she
waited
a
day
two
days
then
a
week
two
weeks
she
thought
herself
bound
to
be
faithful
she
got
into
debt
the
capitalist
called
away
to
holland
had
forgotten
the
girl
he
never
went
once
to
the
paradise
where
he
had
placed
her
and
from
which
she
fell
as
low
as
it
is
possible
to
fall
even
in
paris
nucingen
did
not
gamble
nucingen
did
not
patronize
the
arts
nucingen
had
no
hobby
thus
he
flung
himself
into
his
passion
for
esther
with
a
headlong
blindness
on
which
carlos
herrera
had
confidently
counted
after
his
breakfast
the
baron
sent
for
georges
his
and
desired
him
to
go
to
the
rue
taitbout
and
ask
mademoiselle
eugenie
madame
van
bogseck
s
maid
to
come
to
his
office
on
a
matter
of
importance
you
shall
look
out
for
her
he
added
an
make
her
valk
up
to
my
room
and
tell
her
i
shall
make
her
georges
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
persuading
to
come
madame
never
lets
me
go
out
said
she
i
might
lose
my
place
and
so
forth
and
georges
sang
her
praises
loudly
to
the
baron
who
gave
him
ten
louis
if
madame
goes
out
without
her
this
evening
said
georges
to
his
master
whose
eyes
glowed
like
carbuncles
she
will
be
here
by
ten
o
goot
you
shall
come
to
dress
me
at
nine
o
clock
and
do
my
hair
i
shall
look
so
goot
as
possible
i
belief
i
shall
really
see
dat
mistress
or
money
is
not
money
any
the
baron
spent
an
hour
from
noon
till
one
in
dyeing
his
hair
and
whiskers
at
nine
in
the
evening
having
taken
a
bath
before
dinner
he
made
a
toilet
worthy
of
a
bridegroom
and
scented
himself
a
perfect
adonis
madame
de
nucingen
informed
of
this
metamorphosis
gave
herself
the
treat
of
inspecting
her
husband
good
heavens
cried
she
what
a
ridiculous
figure
do
at
least
put
on
a
black
satin
stock
instead
of
that
white
neckcloth
which
makes
your
whiskers
look
so
black
besides
it
is
so
empire
quite
the
old
fogy
you
look
like
some
parliamentary
counsel
and
take
off
these
diamond
buttons
they
are
worth
a
hundred
thousand
francs
apiece
that
slut
will
ask
you
for
them
and
you
will
not
be
able
to
refuse
her
and
if
a
baggage
is
to
have
them
i
may
as
well
wear
them
as
the
unhappy
banker
struck
by
the
wisdom
of
his
wife
s
reflections
obeyed
reluctantly
ridikilous
ridikilous
i
hafe
never
telt
you
dat
you
shall
be
ridikilous
when
you
dressed
yourself
so
smart
to
see
your
little
mensieur
de
rastignac
i
should
hope
that
you
never
saw
me
make
myself
ridiculous
am
i
the
woman
to
make
such
blunders
in
the
first
syllable
of
my
dress
come
turn
about
button
your
coat
up
to
the
neck
all
but
the
two
top
buttons
as
the
duc
de
maufrigneuse
does
in
short
try
to
look
monsieur
said
georges
here
is
mademoiselle
adie
motame
said
the
banker
and
he
escorted
his
wife
as
far
as
her
own
rooms
to
make
sure
that
she
should
not

their
conference
on

of
ironical
respect

fancy
and
that

on
the
cards
she

the
tone
you
take
about
it
my
worthy
old
fellow
said
europe
that
is
quite
another
where
is
the
money
here
replied
the
baron
holding
up
the
banknotes
one
at
a
time
he
noted
the
flash
struck
by
each
in
turn
from
europe
s
eyes
betraying
the
greed
he
had
counted
on
that
pays
for
my
place
but
how
about
my
principles
my
conscience
said
europe
cocking
her
crafty
little
nose
and
giving
the
baron
a
leer
your
conscience
shall
not
be
pait
for
so
much
as
your
place
but
i

he
adding
five

no

conscience
and
five
thousand
for

but
i
warn
you
of
one
madame
is
as
strong
as
a
turk
she
is
madly
in
love
with
monsieur
de
rubempre
and
if
you
paid
a
million
francs
in
banknotes
she
would
never
be
unfaithful
to
him
it
is
very
silly
but
that
is
her
way
when
she
is
in
love
she
is
worse
than
an
honest
woman
i
tell
you
when
she
goes
out
for
a
drive
in
the
woods
at
night
monsieur
very
seldom
stays
at
home
she
is
gone
out
this
evening

my
room

you
a
cheque
on
my
bank
no
no
said
europe
notes
or
the
bargain
is
so
at
one
in
the
morning
the
baron
de
nucingen
hidden
in
the
garret
where
europe
slept
was
suffering
all
the
anxieties
of
a
man
who
hopes
to
triumph
his
blood
seemed
to
him
to
be
tingling
in
his
and
his
head
ready
to
burst
like
an
overheated
steam
engine
i
had
more
dan
one
hundert
tousand

vort
of
enjoyment
in
my
mind
he
said
to
du
tillet
when
telling
him
the
story
he
listened
to
every
little
noise
in
the
street
and
at
two
in
the
morning
he
heard
his
mistress
carriage
far
away
on
the
boulevard
his
heart
beat
vehemently
under
his
silk
waistcoat
as
the
gate
turned
on
its
hinges
he
was
about
to
behold
the
heavenly
the
glowing
face
of
his
esther
the
clatter
of
the
and
the
slam
of
the
door
struck
upon
his
heart
he
was
more
agitated
in
expectation
of
this
supreme
moment
than
he
would
have
been
if
his
fortune
had
been
at
stake
ah

cried
he

and

said
the
baron
when
he
reached
the

europe
took
the
thirty
notes
very
gravely
and
left
the
room
locking
the
banker
in
nucingen
went
straight
to
the
bedroom
where
he
found
the
handsome
englishwoman

that

lucien
said
she
nein

nucingen
but
he
said
no

he
stood
speechless
on
seeing
a
woman
the
very
antipodes
to
esther
fair
hair
where
he
had
seen
black
slenderness
where
he
had
admired
a
powerful
frame

soft
english
evening
where
he
had
looked

bright
sun
of

were

the
pair
of

europe
set
to
screaming
thief
so
determinedly
that
the
banker
made
for
the
door
in
a
fright
and
europe
tripping
him
up
rolled
him
down
the
stairs
old
wretch
cried
she
you

the
enamored
baron
in
despair
succeeded
in
getting
unhurt
to
his
carriage
which
he
had
left
on
the
boulevard
but
he
was
now
at
his
wits
end
as
to
whom
to
apply
to
and
pray
madame
did
you
think
to
get
my
earnings
out

europe
coming

like
a
fury
to
the

room
i

nothing
of
french
customs
said
the
englishwoman
but
one
word
from
me
to
monsieur
and
you
madame
would
find
yourself
in
the
streets
retorted
europe
insolently
dat
dam
maid
said
the
baron
to
georges
who
naturally
asked
his
master
if
all
had
gone
well
hafe
do
me
out
of
dirty
tousant
franc
but
it
vas
my
own
fault
my
own
great
fault
and
so
monsieur
s
dress
was
all
wasted
the
deuce
is
in
it
i
should
advise
you
monsieur
le
baron
not
to
have
taken
your
tonic
for

georches
i
shall

dying
of
despair
i

i
hafe

no
more
of
esther
my
good
georges
was
always
the
baron
s
friend
when
matters
were
serious
two
days
after
this
scene
which
europe
related
far
more
amusingly
than
it
can
be
written
because
she
told
it
with
much
mimicry
carlos
and
lucien
were
breakfasting
my
dear
boy
neither
the
police
nor
anybody
else
must
be
allowed
to
poke
a
nose
into
our
concerns
said
herrera
in
a
low
voice
as
he
lighted
his
cigar
from
lucien
s
it
would
not
agree
with
us
i
have
hit
on
a
plan
daring
but
effectual
to
keep
our
baron
and
his
agents
quiet
you
must
go
to
see
madame
de
serizy
and
make
yourself
very
agreeable
to
her
tell
her
in
the
course
of
conversation
that
to
oblige
rastignac
who
has
long
been
sick
of
madame
de
nucingen
you
have
consented
to
play
fence
for
him
to
conceal
a
mistress
monsieur
de
nucingen
desperately
in
love
with
this
woman
rastignac
keeps
hidden
that
will
make
her
laugh
has
taken
it
into
his
head
to
set
the
police
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
on
you
who
are
innocent
of
all
his
tricks
and
whose
interest
with
the
grandlieus
may
be
seriously
compromised
then
you
must
beg
the
countess
to
secure
her
husband
s
support
for
he
is
a
minister
of
state
to
carry
you
to
the
prefecture
of
police
when
you
have
got
there
face
to
face
with
the
prefet
make
your
complaint
but
as
a
man
of
political
consequence
who
will
sooner
or
later
be
one
of
the
motor
powers
of
the
huge
machine
of
government
you
will
speak
of
the
police
as
a
statesman
should
admiring
everything
the
prefet
included
the
very
best
machines
make
or
splutter
do
not
be
angry
till
the
right
moment
you
have
no
sort
of
grudge
against
monsieur
le
prefet
but
persuade
him
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
on
his
people
and
pity
him
for
having
to
blow
them
up
the
quieter
and
more
gentlemanly
you
are
the
more
terrible
will
the
prefet
be
to
his
men
then
we
shall
be
left
in
peace
and
we
may
send
for
esther
back
for
she
must
be
belling
like
the
does
in
the
the
prefet
at
that
time
was
a
retired
magistrate
retired
magistrates
make
far
too
young
prefets
partisans
of
the
right
riding
the
high
horse
on
points
of
law
they
are
not
in
arbitary
action
such
as
critical
circumstances
often
require
cases
in
which
the
prefet
should
be
as
prompt
as
a
fireman
called
to
a
conflagration
so
face
to
face
with
the
of
the
council
of
state
the
prefet
confessed
to
more
faults
than
the
police
really
has
deplored
its
abuses
and
presently
was
able
to
recollect
the
visit
paid
to
him
by
the
baron
de
nucingen
and
his
inquiries
as
to
peyrade
the
prefet
while
promising
to
check
the
rash
zeal
of
his
agents
thanked
lucien
for
having
come
straight
to
him
promised
secrecy
and
affected
to
understand
the
intrigue
a
few
fine
speeches
about
personal
liberty
and
the
sacredness
of
home
life
were
bandied
between
the
prefet
and
the
minister
monsieur
de
serizy
observing
in
conclusion
that
though
the
high
interests
of
the
kingdom
sometimes
necessitated
illegal
action
in
secret
crime
began
when
these
state
measures
were
applied
to
private
cases
next
day
just
as
peyrade
was
going
to
his
beloved
cafe
david
where
he
enjoyed
watching
the
bourgeois
eat
as
an
artist
watches
flowers
open
a
gendarme
in
private
clothes
spoke
to
him
in
the
street
i
was
going
to
fetch
you
said
he
in
his
ear
i
have
orders
to
take
you
to
the
peyrade
called
a
hackney
cab
and
got
in
without
saying
a
single
word
followed
by
the
gendarme
the
prefet
treated
peyrade
as
though
he
were
the
lowest
warder
on
the
hulks
walking
to
and
fro
in
a
side
path
of
the
garden
of
the
prefecture
which
at
that
time
was
on
the
quai
des
orfevres
it
is
not
without
good
reason
monsieur
that
since
you
have
been
kept
out
of
office
do
not
you
know
to
what
risk
you
expose
us
not
to
mention
yourself
the
lecture
ended
in
a
thunderstroke
the
prefet
sternly
informed
poor
peyrade
that
not
only
would
his
yearly
allowance
be
cut
off
but
that
he
himself
would
be
narrowly
watched
the
old
man
took
the
shock
with
an
air
of
perfect
calm
nothing
can
be
more
rigidly
expressionless
than
a
man
struck
by
lightning
peyrade
had
lost
all
his
stake
in
the
game
he
had
counted
on
getting
an
appointment
and
he
found
himself
bereft
of
everything
but
the
alms
bestowed
by
his
friend
corentin
i
have
been
the
prefet
of
police
myself
i
think
you
perfectly
right
said
the
old
man
quietly
to
the
functionary
who
stood
before
him
in
his
judicial
majesty
and
who
answered
with
a
significant
shrug
but
allow
me
without
any
attempt
to
justify
myself
to
point
out
that
you
do
not
know
me
at
all
peyrade
went
on
with
a
keen
glance
at
the
prefet
your
language
is
either
too
severe
to
a
man
who
has
been
the
head
of
the
police
in
holland
or
not
severe
enough
for
a
mere
spy
but
monsieur
le
prefet
peyrade
added
after
a
pause
while
the
other
kept
silence
bear
in
mind
what
i
now
have
the
honor
to
telling
you
i
have
no
intention
of
interfering
with
your
police
nor
of
attempting
to
justify
myself
but
you
will
presently
discover
that
there
is
some
one
in
this
business
who
is
being
deceived
at
this
moment
it
is
your
humble
servant
by
and
by
you
will
say
it
was
and
he
bowed
to
the
chief
who
sat
passive
to
conceal
his
amazement
peyrade
returned
home
his
legs
and
arms
feeling
broken
and
full
of
cold
fury
with
the
baron
nobody
but
that
burly
banker
could
have
betrayed
a
secret
contained
in
the
minds
of
contenson
peyrade
and
corentin
the
old
man
accused
the
banker
of
wishing
to
avoid
paying
now
that
he
had
gained
his
end
a
single
interview
had
been
enough
to
enable
him
to
read
the
astuteness
of
this
most
astute
of
bankers
he
tries
to
compound
with
every
one
even
with
us
but
i
will
be
revenged
thought
the
old
fellow
i
have
never
asked
a
favor
of
corentin
i
will
ask
him
now
to
help
me
to
be
revenged
on
that
imbecile
curse
the
baron
well
you
will
know
the
stuff
i
am
made
of
one
fine
morning
when
you
find
your
daughter
disgraced
but
does
he
love
his
daughter
i
wonder
by
the
evening
of
the
day
when
this
catastrophe
had
upset
the
old
man
s
hopes
he
had
aged
by
ten
years
as
he
talked
to
his
friend
corentin
he
mingled
his
lamentations
with
tears
wrung
from
him
by
the
thought
of
the
melancholy
prospects
he
must
bequeath
to
his
daughter
his
idol
his
treasure
his
to
god
we
will
follow
the
matter
up
said
corentin
first
of
all
we
must
be
sure
that
it
was
the
baron
who
peached
were
we
wise
in
enlisting
gondreville
s
support
that
old
rascal
owes
us
too
much
not
to
be
anxious
to
swamp
us
indeed
i
am
keeping
an
eye
on
his
keller
a
simpleton
in
politics
and
quite
capable
of
meddling
in
some
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
elder
branch
to
the
advantage
of
the
i
shall
know
what
is
going
on
at
nucingen
s
whether
he
has
seen
his
beloved
and
to
whom
we
owe
this
sharp
pull
do
not
be
out
of
heart
in
the
first
place
the
prefet
will
not
hold
his
appointment
much
longer
the
times
are
big
with
revolution
and
revolutions
make
good
fishing
for
a
peculiar
whistle
was
just
then
heard
in
the
street
that
is
contenson
said
peyrade
who
put
a
light
in
the
window
and
he
has
something
to
say
that
concerns
a
minute
later
the
faithful
contenson
appeared
in
the
presence
of
the
two
gnomes
of
the
police
whom
he
revered
as
though
they
were
two
genii
what
is
up
asked
corentin
a
new
thing
i
was
coming
out
of
where
i
lost
everything
when
whom
do
i
spy
under
the
gallery
georges
the
man
has
been
dismissed
by
the
baron
who
suspects
him
of
that
is
the
effect
of
a
smile
i
gave
him
said
peyrade
bah
when
i
think
of
all
the
mischief
i
have
known
caused
by
smiles
said
corentin
to
say
nothing
of
that
caused
by
a
said
peyrade
referring
to
the
simeuse
case
in
tenebreuse
but
come
contenson
what
is
going
on
this
is
what
is
going
on
said
contenson
i
made
georges
blab
by
getting
him
to
treat
me
to
an
endless
series
of
liqueurs
of
every
color
i
left
him
tipsy
i
must
be
as
full
as
a
still
myself
our
baron
has
been
to
the
rue
taitbout
crammed
with
pastilles
du
serail
there
he
found
the
fair
one
you
know
of
but
a
good
joke
the
english
beauty
is
not
his
fair
unknown
and
he
has
spent
thirty
thousand
francs
to
bribe
the
lady
a
piece
of
folly
that
creature
thinks
itself
a
great
man
because
it
does
mean
things
with
great
capital
reverse
the
proposition
and
you
have
the
problem
of
which
a
man
of
genius
is
the
the
baron
came
home
in
a
pitiable
condition
next
day
georges
to
get
his
finger
in
the
pie
said
to
his
master
why
monsieur
le
baron
do
you
employ
such
blackguards
if
you
would
only
trust
to
me
i
would
find
the
unknown
lady
for
your
description
of
her
is
enough
i
shall
turn
paris
upside
go
ahead
says
the
baron
i
shall
reward
you
handsomely
georges
told
me
the
whole
story
with
the
most
absurd
details
but
man
is
born
to
be
rained
upon
next
day
the
baron
received
an
anonymous
letter
something
to
this
effect
monsieur
de
nucingen
is
dying
of
love
for
an
unknown
lady
he
has
already
spent
a
great
deal
utterly
in
vain
if
he
will
repair
at
midnight
to
the
end
of
the
neuilly
bridge
and
get
into
the
carriage
behind
which
the
chasseur
he
saw
at
vincennes
will
be
standing
allowing
himself
to
be
blindfolded
he
will
see
the
woman
he
loves
as
his
wealth
may
lead
him
to
suspect
the
intentions
of
persons
who
proceed
in
such
a
fashion
he
may
bring
as
an
escort
his
faithful
georges
and
there
will
be
nobody
in
the
off
the
baron
goes
taking
georges
with
him
but
telling
him
nothing
they
both
submit
to
have
their
eyes
bound
up
and
their
heads
wrapped
in
veils
the
baron
recognizes
the
two
hours
later
the
carriage
going
at
the
pace
of
louis
god
rest
his
soul
he
knew
what
was
meant
by
the
police
he
did
pulled
up
in
the
middle
of
a
wood
the
baron
had
the
handkerchief
off
and
saw
in
a
carriage
standing
still
his
adored
fair
when
whiff
she
vanished
and
the
carriage
at
the
same
lively
pace
brought
him
back
to
the
neuilly
bridge
where
he
found
his
own
some
one
had
slipped
into
georges
hand
a
note
to
this
effect
how
many
banknotes
will
the
baron
part
with
to
be
put
into
communication
with
his
unknown
fair
georges
handed
this
to
his
master
and
the
baron
never
doubting
that
georges
was
in
collusion
with
me
or
with
you
monsieur
peyrade
to
drive
a
hard
bargain
turned
him
out
of
the
house
what
a
fool
that
banker
is
he
ought
not
to
have
sent
away
georges
before
he
had
known
the
unknown
then
georges
saw
the
woman
said
corentin
yes
replied
contenson
well
cried
peyrade
and
what
is
she
like
oh
said
contenson
he
said
but
one
word
a
sun
of
we
are
being
tricked
by
some
rascals
who
beat
us
at
the
game
said
peyrade
those
villains
mean
to
sell
their
woman
very
dear
to
the
ja
mein
herr
said
contenson
and
so
when
i
heard
you
got
slapped
in
the
face
at
the
prefecture
i
made
georges
i
should
like
very
much
to
know
who
it
is
that
has
stolen
a
march
on
me
said
peyrade
we
would
measure
our
spurs
we
must
play
eavesdropper
said
contenson
he
is
right
said
peyrade
we
must
get
into
chinks
to
listen
and
wait
we
will
study
that
side
of
the
subject
cried
corentin
for
the
present
i
am
out
of
work
you
peyrade
be
a
very
good
boy
we
must
always
obey
monsieur
le
prefet
monsieur
de
nucingen
wants
bleeding
said
contenson
he
has
too
many
banknotes
in
his
but
it
was
lydie
s
i
looked
for
there
said
peyrade
in
a
whisper
to
corentin
now
come
along
contenson
let
us
be
off
and
leave
our
daddy
to
monsieur
said
contenson
to
corentin
on
the
doorstep
what
a
queer
piece
of
brokerage
our
good
friend
was
planning
heh
what
marry
a
daughter
with
the
price
of
ah
ha
it
would
make
a
pretty
little
play
and
very
moral
too
entitled
a
girl
s
you
are
highly
organized
animals
indeed
replied
corentin
what
ears
you
have
certainly
social
nature
arms
all
her
species
with
the
qualities
needed
for
the
duties
she
expects
of
them
society
is
second
that
is
a
highly
philosophical
view
to
take
cried
contenson
a
professor
would
work
it
up
into
a
let
us
find
out
all
we
can
replied
corentin
with
a
smile
as
he
made
his
way
down
the
street
with
the
spy
as
to
what
goes
on
at
monsieur
de
nucingen
s
with
regard
to
this
girl
the
main
facts
never
mind
the
details
just
watch
to
see
if
his
chimneys
are
smoking
said
contenson
such
a
man
as
the
baron
de
nucingen
can
not
be
happy
incognito
replied
corentin
and
besides
we
for
whom
men
are
but
cards
ought
never
to
be
tricked
by
by
gad
it
would
be
the
condemned
amusing
himself
by
cutting
the
executioner
s
you
always
have
something
droll
to
say
replied
corentin
with
a
dim
smile
that
faintly
wrinkled
his
set
white
face
this
business
was
exceedingly
important
in
itself
apart
from
its
consequences
if
it
were
not
the
baron
who
had
betrayed
peyrade
who
could
have
had
any
interest
in
seeing
the
prefet
of
police
from
corentin
s
point
of
view
it
seemed
suspicious
were
there
any
traitors
among
his
men
and
as
he
went
to
bed
he
wondered
what
peyrade
too
was
considering
who
can
have
gone
to
complain
to
the
prefet
whom
does
the
woman
belong
to
and
thus
without
knowing
each
other
jacques
collin
peyrade
and
corentin
were
converging
to
a
common
point
while
the
unhappy
esther
nucingen
and
lucien
were
inevitably
entangled
in
the
struggle
which
had
already
begun
and
of
which
the
point
of
pride
peculiar
to
police
agents
was
making
a
war
to
the
death
thanks
to
europe
s
cleverness
the
more
pressing
half
of
the
sixty
thousand
francs
of
debt
owed
by
esther
and
lucien
was
paid
off
the
creditors
did
not
even
lose
confidence
lucien
and
his
evil
genius
could
breathe
for
a
moment
like
some
pool
they
could
start
again
along
the
edge
of
the
precipice
where
the
strong
man
was
guiding
the
weak
man
to
the
gibbet
or
to
fortune
we
are
staking
now
said
carlos
to
his
puppet
to
win
or
lose
all
but
happily
the
cards
are
beveled
and
the
punters
for
some
time
lucien
by
his
terrible
mentor
s
orders
had
been
very
attentive
to
madame
de
serizy
it
was
in
fact
indispensable
that
lucien
should
not
be
suspected
of
having
kept
a
woman
for
his
mistress
and
in
the
pleasure
of
being
loved
and
the
excitement
of
fashionable
life
he
found
a
spurious
power
of
forgetting
he
obeyed
mademoiselle
clotilde
de
grandlieu
by
never
seeing
her
excepting
in
the
bois
or
the
on
the
day
after
esther
was
shut
up
in
the
s
house
the
being
who
was
to
her
so
enigmatic
and
terrible
who
weighed
upon
her
soul
came
to
desire
her
to
sign
three
pieces
of
stamped
paper
made
terrible
by
these
fateful
words
on
the
first
accepted
payable
for
sixty
thousand
francs
on
the
second
accepted
payable
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
francs
on
the
third
accepted
payable
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
francs
three
hundred
thousand
francs
in
all
by
writing
you
simply
promise
to
pay
the
word
constitutes
a
bill
of
exchange
and
makes
you
liable
to
imprisonment
the
word
entails
on
the
person
who
is
so
imprudent
as
to
sign
the
risk
of
five
years
imprisonment
a
punishment
which
the
police
magistrate
hardly
ever
inflicts
and
which
is
reserved
at
the
assizes
for
confirmed
rogues
the
law
of
imprisonment
for
debt
is
a
relic
of
the
days
of
barbarism
which
combines
with
its
stupidity
the
rare
merit
of
being
useless
inasmuch
as
it
never
catches
swindlers
the
point
said
the
spaniard
to
esther
is
to
get
lucien
out
of
his
difficulties
we
have
debts
to
the
tune
of
sixty
thousand
francs
and
with
these
three
hundred
thousand
francs
we
may
perhaps
pull
having
antedated
the
bills
by
six
months
carlos
had
had
them
drawn
on
esther
by
a
man
whom
the
county
court
had
misunderstood
and
whose
adventures
in
spite
of
the
excitement
they
had
caused
were
soon
forgotten
hidden
lost
in
the
uproar
of
the
great
symphony
of
july
this
young
fellow
a
most
audacious
adventurer
the
son
of
a
lawyer
s
clerk
of
boulogne
near
paris
was
named
georges
marie
destourny
his
father
obliged
by
adverse
circumstances
to
sell
his
connection
died
in
leaving
his
son
without
the
means
of
living
after
giving
him
a
brilliant
education
the
folly
of
the
lower
middle
class
at
the
clever
young
had
denied
his
paternity
by
printing
on
his
cards
georges
d
estourny
this
card
gave
him
an
odor
of
aristocracy
and
now
as
a
man
of
fashion
he
was
so
impudent
as
to
set
up
a
tilbury
and
a
groom
and
haunt
the
clubs
one
line
will
account
for
this
he
gambled
on
the
bourse
with
the
money
intrusted
to
him
by
the
kept
women
of
his
acquaintance
finally
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
police
and
was
charged
with
playing
at
cards
with
too
much
luck
he
had
accomplices
youths
whom
he
had
corrupted
his
compulsory
satellites
accessory
to
his
fashion
and
his
credit
compelled
to
fly
he
forgot
to
pay
his
differences
on
the
bourse
all
paris
the
paris
of
the
stock
exchange
and
clubs
was
still
shaken
by
this
double
stroke
of
swindling
in
the
days
of
his
splendor
georges
d
estourny
a
handsome
youth
and
above
all
a
jolly
fellow
as
generous
as
a
brigand
chief
had
for
a
few
months
protected
la
torpille
the
false
abbe
based
his
calculations
on
esther
s
former
intimacy
with
this
famous
scoundrel
an
incident
peculiar
to
women
of
her
class
georges
d
estourny
whose
ambition
grew
bolder
with
success
had
taken
under
his
patronage
a
man
who
had
come
from
the
depths
of
the
country
to
carry
on
a
business
in
paris
and
whom
the
liberal
party
were
anxious
to
indemnify
for
certain
sentences
endured
with
much
courage
in
the
struggle
of
the
press
with
charles
s
government
the
persecution
being
relaxed
however
during
the
martignac
administration
the
sieur
cerizet
had
then
been
pardoned
and
he
was
henceforth
known
as
the
brave
cerizet
cerizet
then
being
patronized
for
form
s
sake
by
the
bigwigs
of
the
left
founded
a
house
which
combined
the
business
of
a
general
agency
with
that
of
a
bank
and
a
commission
agency
it
was
one
of
those
concerns
which
in
business
remind
one
of
the
servants
who
advertise
in
the
papers
as
being
able
and
willing
to
do
everything
cerizet
was
very
glad
to
ally
himself
with
georges
d
estourny
who
gave
him
hints
esther
in
virtue
of
the
anecdote
about
nonon
might
be
regarded
as
the
faithful
guardian
of
part
of
georges
d
estourny
s
fortune
an
endorsement
in
the
name
of
georges
d
estourny
made
carlos
herrera
master
of
the
money
he
had
created
this
forgery
was
perfectly
safe
so
long
as
mademoiselle
esther
or
some
one
for
her
could
or
was
bound
to
pay
after
making
inquiries
as
to
the
house
of
cerizet
carlos
perceived
that
he
had
to
do
with
one
of
those
humble
men
who
are
bent
on
making
a
fortune
but
lawfully
cerizet
with
whom
d
estourny
had
really
deposited
his
moneys
had
in
hand
a
considerable
sum
with
which
he
was
speculating
for
a
rise
on
the
bourse
a
state
of
affairs
which
allowed
him
to
style
himself
a
banker
such
things
are
done
in
paris
a
man
may
be
despised
but
money
never
carlos
went
off
to
cerizet
intending
to
work
him
after
his
manner
for
as
it
happened
he
was
master
of
all
this
worthy
s
secrets
a
meet
partner
for
d
estourny
cerizet
the
brave
lived
in
an
entresol
in
the
rue
du
and
carlos
who
had
himself
mysteriously
announced
as
coming
from
georges
d
estourny
found
the
banker
quite
pale
at
the
name
the
abbe
saw
in
this
humble
private
room
a
little
man
with
thin
light
hair
and
recognized
him
at
once
from
lucien
s
description
as
the
judas
who
had
ruined
david
sechard
can
we
talk
here
without
risk
of
being
overheard
said
the
spaniard
now
metamorphosed
into
a
englishman
with
blue
spectacles
as
clean
and
prim
as
a
puritan
going
to
meeting
why
monsieur
said
cerizet
who
are
you
mr
william
barker
a
creditor
of
d
estourny
s
and
i
can
prove
to
you
the
necessity
for
keeping
your
doors
closed
if
you
wish
it
we
know
monsieur
all
about
your
connections
with
the
the
cointets
and
the
sechards
of
angouleme
on
hearing
these
words
cerizet
rushed
to
the
door
and
shut
it
flew
to
another
leading
into
a
bedroom
and
bolted
it
then
he
said
to
the
stranger
speak
lower
monsieur
and
he
studied
the
sham
englishman
as
he
asked
him
what
do
you
want
with
me
dear
me
said
william
barker
every
one
for
himself
in
this
world
you
had
the
money
of
that
rascal
d
be
quite
easy
i
have
not
come
to
ask
for
it
but
that
scoundrel
who
deserves
hanging
between
you
and
me
gave
me
these
bills
saying
that
there
might
be
some
chance
of
recovering
the
money
and
as
i
do
not
choose
to
prosecute
in
my
own
name
he
told
me
you
would
not
refuse
to
back
cerizet
looked
at
the
bills
but
he
is
no
longer
at
frankfort
said
he
i
know
it
replied
barker
but
he
may
still
have
been
there
at
the
date
of
those
bills
i
will
not
take
the
responsibility
said
cerizet
i
do
not
ask
such
a
sacrifice
of
you
replied
barker
you
may
be
instructed
to
receive
them
endorse
them
and
i
will
undertake
to
recover
the
i
am
surprised
that
d
estourny
should
show
so
little
confidence
in
me
said
cerizet
in
his
position
replied
barker
you
can
hardly
blame
him
for
having
put
his
eggs
in
different
can
you
believe
the
little
broker
began
as
he
handed
back
to
the
englishman
the
bills
of
exchange
formally
accepted
i
believe
that
you
will
take
good
care
of
his
money
said
barker
i
am
sure
of
it
it
is
already
on
the
green
table
of
the
my
fortune
depends
on
your
appearing
to
lose
it
said
barker
sir
cried
cerizet
look
here
my
dear
monsieur
cerizet
said
barker
coolly
interrupting
him
you
will
do
me
a
service
by
facilitating
this
payment
be
so
good
as
to
write
me
a
letter
in
which
you
tell
me
that
you
are
sending
me
these
bills
receipted
on
d

s
account
and
that
the
collecting
officer
is
to
regard
the
holder
of
the
letter
as
the
possessor
of
the
three
will
you
give
me
your
name
no
names
replied
the
english
capitalist
put
the
bearer
of
this
letter
and
these
you
will
be
handsomely
repaid
for
obliging
how
said
cerizet
in
one
word
you
mean
to
stay
in
france
do
not
you
yes
well
georges
d
estourny
will
never
the
pray
why
there
are
five
persons
at
least
to
my
knowledge
who
would
murder
him
and
he
knows
then
no
wonder
he
is
asking
me
for
money
enough
to
start
him
trading
to
the
indies
cried
cerizet
and
unfortunately
he
has
compelled
me
to
risk
everything
in
state
speculation
we
already
owe
heavy
differences
to
the
house
of
du
tillet
i
live
from
hand
to
withdraw
your
oh
if
only
i
had
known
this
sooner
exclaimed
cerizet
i
have
missed
my
chance
one
last
word
said
barker
keep
your
own
counsel
you
are
capable
of
that
but
you
must
be
faithful
too
which
is
perhaps
less
certain
we
shall
meet
again
and
i
will
help
you
to
make
a
having
tossed
this
sordid
soul
a
crumb
of
hope
that
would
secure
silence
for
some
time
to
come
carlos
still
disguised
as
barker
betook
himself
to
a
bailiff
whom
he
could
depend
on
and
instructed
him
to
get
the
bills
brought
home
to
esther
they
will
be
paid
all
right
said
he
to
the
officer
it
is
an
affair
of
honor
only
we
want
to
do
the
thing
barker
got
a
solicitor
to
represent
esther
in
court
so
that
judgment
might
be
given
in
presence
of
both
parties
the
collecting
officer
who
was
begged
to
act
with
civility
took
with
him
all
the
warrants
for
procedure
and
came
in
person
to
seize
the
furniture
in
the
rue
taitbout
where
he
was
received
by
europe
her
personal
liability
once
proved
esther
was
ostensibly
liable
beyond
dispute
for
three
hundred
and
more
thousand
francs
of
debts
in
all
this
carlos
displayed
no
great
powers
of
invention
the
farce
of
false
debts
is
often
played
in
paris
there
are
many
and
who
for
a
percentage
will
lend
themselves
to
this
subterfuge
and
regard
the
infamous
trick
as
a
jest
in
france
everything
even
a
crime
is
done
with
a
laugh
by
this
means
refractory
parents
are
made
to
pay
or
rich
mistresses
who
might
drive
a
hard
bargain
but
who
face
to
face
with
flagrant
necessity
or
some
impending
dishonor
pay
up
if
with
a
bad
grace
maxime
de
trailles
had
often
used
such
means
borrowed
from
the
comedies
of
the
old
stage
carlos
herrera
who
wanted
to
save
the
honor
of
his
gown
as
well
as
lucien
s
had
worked
the
spell
by
a
forgery
not
dangerous
for
him
but
now
so
frequently
practised
that
justice
is
beginning
to
object
there
is
it
is
said
a
bourse
for
falsified
bills
near
the
palais
royal
where
you
may
get
a
forged
signature
for
three
francs
before
entering
on
the
question
of
the
hundred
thousand
crowns
that
were
to
keep
the
door
of
the
bedroom
carlos
determined
first
to
extract
a
hundred
thousand
more
from
de
nucingen
and
this
was
the
way
by
his
orders
asie
got
herself
up
for
the
baron
s
benefit
as
an
old
woman
fully
informed
as
to
the
unknown
beauty
s
affairs
hitherto
novelists
of
manners
have
placed
on
the
stage
a
great
many
usurers
but
the
female
has
been
overlooked
the
madame
la
ressource
of
the
present
day
a
very
singular
figure
euphemistically
spoken
of
as
a
purchaser
a
part
that
the
ferocious
asie
could
play
for
she
had
two
shops
managed
by
women
she
could
trust
one
in
the
temple
and
the
other
in
the
rue
you
must
get
into
the
skin
of
madame
de
said
he
herrera
wished
to
see
asie
dressed
the
arrived
in
a
dress
of
flowered
damask
made
of
the
curtains
of
some
dismantled
boudoir
and
one
of
those
shawls
of
indian
design
out
of
date
worn
and
valueless
which
end
their
career
on
the
backs
of
these
women
she
had
a
collar
of
magnificent
lace
though
torn
and
a
terrible
bonnet
but
her
shoes
were
of
fine
kid
in
which
the
flesh
of
her
fat
feet
made
a
roll
of
stocking
and
my
waist
buckle
she
exclaimed
displaying
a
piece
of
finery
prominent
on
her
cook
s
stomach
there
s
style
for
you
and
my
front
oh
ma
me
nourrisson
has
turned
me
out
quite
spiff
be
as
sweet
as
honey
at
first
said
carlos
be
almost
timid
as
suspicious
as
a
cat
and
above
all
make
the
baron
ashamed
of
having
employed
the
police
without
betraying
that
you
quake
before
the
constable
finally
make
your
customer
understand
in
more
or
less
plain
terms
that
you
defy
all
the
police
in
the
world
to
discover
his
jewel
take
care
to
destroy
your
traces
when
the
baron
gives
you
a
right
to
tap
him
on
the
stomach
and
call
him
a
old
rip
you
may
be
as
insolent
as
you
please
and
make
him
trot
like
a
nucingen
threatened
by
asie
with
never
seeing
her
again
if
he
attempted
the
smallest
espionage
met
the
woman
on
his
way
to
the
bourse
in
secret
in
a
wretched
entresol
in
the
rue
how
often
and
with
what
rapture
have
amorous
millionaires
trodden
these
squalid
paths
the
pavements
of
paris
know
madame
de
by
tossing
the
baron
from
hope
to
despair
by
turns
brought
him
to
the
point
when
he
insisted
on
being
informed
of
all
that
related
to
the
unknown
beauty
at
any
cost
meanwhile
the
law
was
put
in
force
and
with
such
effect
that
the
bailiffs
finding
no
resistance
from
esther
put
in
an
execution
on
her
effects
without
losing
a
day
lucien
guided
by
his
adviser
paid
the
recluse
at
five
or
six
visits
the
merciless
author
of
all
these
machinations
thought
this
necessary
to
save
esther
from
pining
to
death
for
her
beauty
was
now
their
capital
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
quit
the
s
lodge
he
took
lucien
and
the
poor
girl
to
a
place
on
the
road
whence
they
could
see
paris
where
no
one
could
overhear
them
they
all
three
sat
down
in
the
rising
sun
on
the
trunk
of
a
felled
poplar
looking
over
one
of
the
finest
prospects
in
the
world
embracing
the
course
of
the
seine
with
montmartre
paris
and
my
children
said
carlos
your
dream
is
you
little
one
will
never
see
lucien
again
or
if
you
should
you
must
have
known
him
only
for
a
few
days
five
years
death
has
come
upon
me
then
said
she
without
shedding
a
tear
well
you
have
been
ill
these
five
years
said
herrera
imagine
yourself
to
be
consumptive
and
die
without
boring
us
with
your
lamentations
but
you
will
see
you
can
still
live
and
very
comfortably
leave
us
lucien
go
and
gather
sonnets
said
he
pointing
to
a
field
a
little
way
off
lucien
cast
a
look
of
humble
entreaty
at
esther
one
of
the
looks
peculiar
to
such
men
weak
and
greedy
with
tender
hearts
and
cowardly
spirits
esther
answered
with
a
bow
of
her
head
which
said
i
will
hear
the
executioner
that
i
may
know
how
to
lay
my
head
under
the
axe
and
i
shall
have
courage
enough
to
die
the
gesture
was
so
gracious
but
so
full
of
dreadful
meaning
that
the
poet
wept
esther
flew
to
him
clasped
him
in
her
arms
drank
away
the
tears
and
said
be
quite
easy
one
of
those
speeches
that
are
spoken
with
the
manner
the
look
the
tones
of
delirium
carlos
then
explained
to
her
quite
clearly
without
attenuation
often
with
horrible
plainness
of
speech
the
critical
position
in
which
lucien
found
himself
his
connection
with
the
hotel
grandlieu
his
splendid
prospects
if
he
should
succeed
and
finally
how
necessary
it
was
that
esther
should
sacrifice
herself
to
secure
him
this
triumphant
future
what
must
i
do
cried
she
with
the
eagerness
of
a
fanatic
obey
me
blindly
said
carlos
and
what
have
you
to
complain
of
it
rests
with
you
to
achieve
a
happy
lot
you
may
be
what
tullia
is
what
your
old
friends
florine
mariette
and
la
are
the
mistress
of
a
rich
man
whom
you
need
not
love
when
once
our
business
is
settled
your
lover
is
rich
enough
to
make
you
happy
said
she
raising
her
eyes
to
heaven
you
have
lived
in
paradise
for
four
years
said
he
can
you
not
live
on
such
memories
i
will
obey
you
said
she
wiping
a
tear
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
for
the
rest
do
not
worry
yourself
you
have
said
it
my
love
is
a
mortal
that
is
not
enough
said
carlos
you
must
preserve
your
looks
at
a
little
past
you
are
in
the
prime
of
your
beauty
thanks
to
your
past
happiness
and
above
all
be
the
torpille
again
be
roguish
extravagant
cunning
merciless
to
the
millionaire
i
put
in
your
power
listen
to
me
that
man
is
a
robber
on
a
grand
scale
he
has
been
ruthless
to
many
persons
he
has
grown
fat
on
the
fortunes
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
you
will
avenge
them
asie
is
coming
to
fetch
you
in
a
hackney
coach
and
you
will
be
in
paris
this
evening
if
you
allow
any
one
to
suspect
your
connection
with
lucien
you
may
as
well
blow
his
brains
out
at
once
you
will
be
asked
where
you
have
been
for
so
long
you
must
say
that
you
have
been
traveling
with
a
desperately
jealous
you
used
to
have
wit
enough
to
humbug
people
find
such
wit
again
have
you
ever
seen
a
gorgeous
kite
the
giant
butterfly
of
childhood
twinkling
with
gilding
and
soaring
to
the
sky
the
children
forget
the
string
that
holds
it
some
cuts
it
the
gaudy
toy
turns
head
over
heels
as
the
boys
say
and
falls
with
terrific
rapidity
such
was
esther
as
she
listened
to
carlos
what
love
costs
an
old
man
for
a
whole
week
nucingen
went
almost
every
day
to
the
shop
in
the
rue
to
bargain
for
the
woman
he
was
in
love
with
here
sometimes
under
the
name
of
sometimes
under
that
of
her
tool
madame
nourrisson
asie
sat
enthroned
among
beautiful
clothes
in
that
hideous
condition
when
they
have
ceased
to
be
dresses
and
are
not
yet
rags
the
setting
was
in
harmony
with
the
appearance
assumed
by
the
woman
for
these
shops
are
among
the
most
hideous
characteristics
of
paris
you
find
there
the
garments
tossed
aside
by
the
skinny
hand
of
death
you
hear
as
it
were
the
gasping
of
consumption
under
a
shawl
or
you
detect
the
agonies
of
beggery
under
a
gown
spangled
with
gold
the
horrible
struggle
between
luxury
and
starvation
is
written
on
filmy
laces
you
may
picture
the
countenance
of
a
queen
under
a
plumed
turban
placed
in
an
attitude
that
recalls
and
almost
reproduces
the
absent
features
it
is
all
hideous
amid
prettiness
juvenal
s
lash
in
the
hands
of
the
appraiser
scatters
the
shabby
muffs
the
ragged
furs
of
courtesans
at
bay
there
is
a
dunghill
of
flowers
among
which
here
and
there
we
find
a
bright
rose
plucked
but
yesterday
and
worn
for
a
day
and
on
this
an
old
hag
is
always
to
be
seen
crouching
first
cousin
to
usury
the
skinflint
bargainer
bald
and
toothless
and
ever
ready
to
sell
the
contents
so
well
is
she
used
to
sell
the
covering
the
gown
without
the
woman
or
the
woman
without
the
gown
here
asie
was
in
her
element
like
the
warder
among
convicts
like
a
vulture
amid
corpses
more
terrible
than
the
savage
horrors
that
made
the
shudder
in
astonishment
sometimes
at
seeing
one
of
their
youngest
and
sweetest
reminiscences
hung
up
in
a
dirty
shop
window
behind
which
a
sits
and
grins
from
vexation
to
vexation
a
thousand
francs
at
a
time
the
banker
had
gone
so
far
as
to
offer
sixty
thousand
francs
to
madame
de
who
still
refused
to
help
him
with
a
grimace
that
would
have
outdone
any
monkey
after
a
disturbed
night
after
confessing
to
himself
that
esther
completely
upset
his
ideas
after
realizing
some
unexpected
turns
of
fortune
on
the
bourse
he
came
to
her
one
day
intending
to
give
the
hundred
thousand
francs
on
which
asie
insisted
but
he
was
determined
to
have
plenty
of
information
for
the
money
well
have
you
made
up
your
mind
old
higgler
said
asie
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
the
most
dishonoring
familiarity
is
the
first
tax
these
women
levy
on
the
frantic
passions
or
griefs
that
are
confided
to
them
they
never
rise
to
the
level
of
their
clients
they
make
them
seem
squat
beside
them
on
their
mudheap
asie
it
will
be
seen
obeyed
her
master
admirably
need
must
said
nucingen
and
you
have
the
best
of
the
bargain
said
asie
women
have
been
sold
much
dearer
than
this
one
to
you
relatively
speaking
there
are
women
and
women
de
marsay
paid
sixty
thousand
francs
for
coralie
who
is
dead
now
the
woman
you
want

a
hundred
thousand
francs
when
new
but
to
you
you
old
goat
it
is
a
matter
of
but
vere
is
she
ah
you
shall
see
i
am
like
you
a
gift
for
a
gift
oh
my
good
man
your
adored
one
has
been
extravagant
these
girls
know
no
moderation
your
princess
is
at
this
moment
what
we
call
a
fly
by
night
a
fly
come
come
don
t
play
the
louchard
is
at
her
heels
and
i
i
have
lent
her
fifty
thousand
francs
say
cried
the
banker
well
of
course
for
fifty
that
is
only
natural
replied
asie
to
do
the
woman
justice
she
is
honesty
itself
she
had
nothing
left
but
herself
and
says
she
to
me
my
good
madame
the
bailiffs
are
after
me
no
one
can
help
me
but
you
give
me
twenty
thousand
francs
i
will
pledge
my
heart
to
oh
she
has
a
sweet
heart
no
one
but
me
knows
where
it
lies
any
folly
on
my
part
and
i
should
lose
my
twenty
thousand
francs
formerly
she
lived
in
the
rue
taitbout
before
leaving
her
furniture
was
seized
for
costs
those
rascally
bailiffs
you
know
them
you
who
are
one
of
the
great
men
on
the
bourse
well
before
leaving
she
is
no
fool
she
let
her
rooms
for
two
months
to
an
englishwoman
a
splendid
creature
who
had
a
little
thingummy
rubempre
for
a
lover
and
he
was
so
jealous
that
he
only
let
her
go
out
at
night
but
as
the
furniture
is
to
be
seized
the
englishwoman
has
cut
her
stick
all
the
more
because
she
cost
too
much
for
a
little
like
you
cry
up
de
goots
said
nucingen
naturally
said
asie
i
lend
to
the
beauties
and
it
pays
for
you
get
two
commissions
for
one
asie
was
amusing
herself
by
caricaturing
the
manners
of
a
class
of
women
who
are
even
greedier
but
more
wheedling
and
than
the
malay
woman
and
who
put
a
gloss
of
the
best
motives
on
the
trade
they
ply
asie
affected
to
have
lost
all
her
illusions
five
lovers
and
some
children
and
to
have
submitted
to
be
robbed
by
everybody
in
spite
of
her
experience
from
time
to
time
she
exhibited
some
to
prove
how
much
bad
luck
there
was
in
her
line
of
business
she
represented
herself
as
pinched
and
in
debt
and
to
crown
all
she
was
so
undisguisedly
hideous
that
the
baron
at
last
believed
her
to
be
all
she
said
she
was
vell
den
i
shall
pay
the
hundert
tousant
and
vere
shall
i
see
her
said
he
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
made
up
his
mind
to
any
sacrifice
my
fat
friend
you
shall
come
this
evening
in
your
carriage
of
course
opposite
the
gymnase
it
is
on

way

asie

at
the

till
dis
the
baron
repeated
the
bridal
toilet
he
had
already
once
achieved
but
this
time
being
certain
of
success
he
took
a
double
dose
of
pillules
at
nine
o
clock
he
found
the
dreadful
woman
at
the
appointed
spot
and
took
her
into
his

to
the
rue

where
in
furnished
lodgings
kept
by
an
upholsterer
he
was
led
up
to
the
fourth
floor
on
finding
esther
in
a
squalid
room
dressed
as
a

employed
on
some
embroidery
the
millionaire
turned
pale
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
while
asie
affected
to
talk
in
whispers
to
esther
the
young
old
man
could
hardly
speak
montemisselle
said
he
at
length
to
the
unhappy
girl

she
went
on
leading
nucingen
into
the
adjoining
room
you
remember
our
bargain
my
angel
nucingen
took
out
his
pocketbook
and
counted
out
the
hundred
thousand
francs
which
carlos
hidden
in
a
cupboard
was
impatiently
waiting
for
and
which
the
cook
handed
over

confidante
when
they
were
on
the
landing
and
he
vanished
after
giving
his
instruction
to
the
malay
who
went
back
into
the
room
she
found
esther
weeping
bitterly
the
poor
girl
like
a
criminal
condemned
to
death
had
woven
a
romance
of
hope
and
the
fatal
hour
had
tolled
my
dear
children
said
asie
where
do
you
mean
to
go
for
the

at
the

with
a

of
surprise
that
was
admirably
acted

asie
and

cried
the
millionaire
laughing
she
haf
fleeced
me
out
of
dirty
tousant
esther
shuddered
with
horror
in
a
way
that
would
have
led
a
man
of
any
feeling
to
trust
her
with
his
fortune
oh
dat
vas
mein

the
baron
said
i

he
related
the
incident
that
had
arisen
out
of
the
letting
of
esther
s
rooms
to
the
englishwoman
there
now
you
see
madame
eugenie
never

said
still
madame
is
used
to
the
hussy
she
added
to
the
baron
keep
her
on
all
the
she
drew
nucingen
aside
and
said
if
you
give
eugenie
five
hundred
francs
a

fill
up
her
stocking
finely
you
can
know
everything
that
madame
does
make
her
the
lady
eugenie
will
be
all
the
more
devoted
to
you
since
she
has
already
done
nothing
attaches
a
woman
to
a
man
more
than
the
fact
that
she
has
once
fleeced
him
but
keep
a
tight
rein
on
eugenie
she
will
do
any
earthly
thing
for
money
she
is
a
dreadful
creature
an
vat
of
you
i
said
asie
i
make
both
ends
nucingen
the
astute
financier
had
a
bandage
over
his
eyes
he
allowed
himself
to
be
led
like
a
child
the
sight
of
that
spotless
and
adorable
esther
wiping
her
eyes
and
pricking
in
the
stitches
of
her
embroidery
as
demurely
as
an
innocent
girl
revived
in
the
amorous
old
man
the
sensations
he
had
experienced
in
the
forest
of
vincennes
he
would
have
given
her
the
key
of
his
safe
he
felt
so
young
his
heart
was
so
overflowing
with
adoration
he
only
waited
till
asie
should
be
gone
to
throw
himself
at
the
feet
of
this
raphael
s
madonna
this
sudden
blossoming
of
youth
in
the
heart
of
a
stockbroker
of
an
old
man
is
one
of
the
social
phenomena
which
must
be
left
to
physiology
to
account
for
crushed
under
the
burden
of
business
stifled
under
endless
calculations
and
the
incessant
anxieties
of
young
emotions
revive
with
their
sublime
illusions
sprout
and
flower
like
a
forgotten
cause
or
a
forgotten
seed
whose
effects
whose
gorgeous
bloom
are
the
sport
of
chance
brought
out
by
a
late
and
sudden
gleam
of
sunshine
the
baron
a
clerk
by
the
time
he
was
twelve
years
old
in
the
ancient
house
of
aldrigger
at
strasbourg
had
never
set
foot
in
the
world
of
sentiment
so
there
he
stood
in
front
of
his
idol
hearing
in
his
brain
a
thousand
modes
of
speech
while
none
came
to
his
lips
till
at
length
he
acted
on
the
brutal
promptings
of
desire
that
betrayed
a
man
of
vill
you
come
to
rue
taitbout
said
he
wherever
you
please
monsieur
said
esther
rising
verever
i

he
echoed
in
rapture
you

i

you
more
as
if
i
was
a
little

are
too
fine
a

to

said
asie
get

foul
dealer
in
human
flesh
you
hafe
got
your
moneys
do
not
slobber
no
more
on
dis
flower
of

cried
the
banker
indemnifying
himself
by
this
violent
abuse
for
all
the
insolence
he
had
submitted
to
you
old
rip
i
will
pay
you
out
for
that
speech
said
asie
threatening
the
banker
with
a
gesture
worthy
of
the
halle
at
which
the
baron
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
between
the
lip
of
the
pot
and
that
of
the
guzzler
there
is
often
a
viper
and
you
will
find
me
there
she
went
on
furious
at
nucingen
s
contempt
millionaires
whose
money
is
guarded
by
the
bank
of
france
whose
mansions
are
guarded
by
a
squad
of
footmen
whose
person
in
the
streets
is
safe
behind
the
rampart
of
a
coach
with
swift
english
horses
fear
no
ill
so
the
baron
looked
calmly
at
asie
as
a
man
who
had
just
given
her
a
hundred
thousand
francs
this
dignity
had
its
effect
asie
beat
a
retreat
growling
down
the
stairs
in
highly
revolutionary
language
she
spoke
of
the
guillotine
what
have
you
said
to
her
asked
the

for
she
is
a

she
in
a
tone
to
rend
the
heart
of
a
diplomate
who
has
ever
any
money
or
consideration
for

poor
leetle

said
nucingen
do
not

ein
moment
the
baron
offered
her
his
arm
he
led
her
away
just
as
she
was
and
put
her
into
his
carriage
with
more
respect
perhaps
than
he
would
have
shown
to
the
handsome
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
you

on
arriving
at
the
rue
taitbout
esther
could
not
return
to
the
scene
of
her
happiness
without
some
pain
she
remained
sitting
on
a
couch
motionless
drying
away
her
tears
one
by
one
and
never
hearing
a
word
of
the
crazy
speeches
poured
out
by
the
banker
he
fell
at
her
feet
and
she
let
him
kneel
without
saying
a
word
to
him
allowing
him
to
take
her
hands
as
he
would
and
never
thinking
of
the
sex
of
the
creature
who
was
rubbing
her
feet
to
warm
them
for
nucingen
found
that
they
were
cold
this
scene
of
scalding
tears
shed
on
the
baron
s
head
and
of
feet
that
he
tried
to
warm
lasted
from
midnight
till
two
in
the
morning
eugenie
cried
the
baron
at
last
to
europe
persvade
your
mis
ess
that
she

esther
starting
to
her
feet
like
a
scared
horse
never
in
this
house
look

monsieur
i

madame
she
is
as
gentle
and
kind
as
a
lamb
said
europe
to
the
baron
only
you
must
not
rub
her
the
wrong
way
you
must
get
at
her
sideways
she
had
been
so
miserable
you
see
how
worn
the
furniture
let
her
go
her
own
way
furnish
some
pretty
little
house
for
her
very
nicely
perhaps
when
she
sees
everything
new
about
her
she
will
feel
a
stranger
there
and
think
you
better
looking
than
you
are
and
be
angelically
oh
madame
has
not
her
match
and
you
may
boast
of
having
done
a
very
good
stroke
of
business
a
good
heart
genteel
manners
a
fine
instep
and
a
skin
a
complexion
ah
and
witty
enough
to
make
a
condemned
wretch
laugh
and
madame
can
feel
an
and
then
how
she
can
dress
well
if
it
is
costly
still
as
they
say
you

your
money
s
here
all
the
gowns
were
seized
everything
she
has
is
three
months
but
madame
is
so
kind
you
see
that
i
love
her
and
she
is
my
mistress
but
in
all
justice
such
a
woman
as
she
is
in
the
midst
of
furniture
that
has
been
seized
and
for
whom
for
a
young
scamp
who
has
ruined
her

cried
the
baron
fired
by
the
purest
devotion
as
he
saw
that
esther
was
still
weeping
well
then
said
esther
taking
the
lynx
s
hand
and
kissing
it
with
an
impulse
of
gratitude
which
brought
something
very
like
a
tear
to
his
eye
i
shall
be
grateful
to
you
and
she
fled
into
her
room
and
locked
the
door
dere
is
someting

strange
in
all
dat
thought
nucingen
excited
by
his

and
looked

walked
up

down
the
room
vat
montame

ven
she
should
know
how
i
hafe
spent
dis

he
applied
his
ear
to
the
bedroom
door
thinking
himself
rather
too
much
of
a
simpleton
esther
no
reply
mein
gott
and
she
is
still
veeping
said
he
to
himself
as
he
stretched
himself
on
the
sofa
about
ten
minutes
after
sunrise
the
baron
de
nucingen
who
was
sleeping
the
uneasy
slumbers
that
are
snatched
by
compulsion
in
an
awkward
position
on
a
couch
was
aroused
with
a
start
by
europe
from
one
of
those
dreams
that
visit
us
in
such
moments
and
of
which
the
swift
complications
are
a
phenomenon
inexplicable
by
medical
physiology
oh
god
help
us
madame
she
shrieked
madame
the
soldiers
gendarmes
bailiffs
they
have
come
to
take
at
the
moment
when
esther
opened
her
door
and
appeared
hurriedly
wrapped
in
her
her
bare
feet
in
slippers
her
hair
in
disorder
lovely
enough
to
bring
the
angel
raphael
to
perdition
the
door
vomited
into
the
room
a
gutter
of
human
mire
that
came
on
on
ten
feet
towards
the
beautiful
girl
who
stood
like
an
angel
in
some
flemish
church
picture
one
man
came
foremost
contenson
the
horrible
contenson
laid
his
hand
on
esther
s
dewy
shoulder
you
are
mademoiselle
van
he
began
europe
by
a
slap
on
contenson
s
cheek
sent
him
sprawling
to
measure
his
length
on
the
carpet
and
with
all
the
more
effect
because
at
the
same
time
she
caught
his
leg
with
the
sharp
kick
known
to
those
who
practise
the
art
as
a
coup
de
savate
hands
off
cried
she
no
one
shall
touch
my
she
has
broken
my
leg
yelled
contenson
picking
himself
up
i
will
have
damages
from
the
group
of
bumbailiffs
looking
like
what
they
were
all
standing
with
their
horrible
hats
on
their
yet
more
horrible
heads
with
faces
and
bleared
eyes
damaged
noses
and
hideous
mouths
louchard
now
stepped
forth
more
decently
dressed
than
his
men
but
keeping
his
hat
on
his
expression
at
once
and
smiling
mademoiselle
i
arrest
you
said
he
to
esther
as
for
you
my
girl
he
added
to
europe
any
resistance
will
be
punished
and
perfectly
the
noise
of
muskets
let
down
with
a
thud
of
their
stocks
on
the
floor
of
the
showing
that
the
invaders
had
soldiers
to
bake
them
gave
emphasis
to
this
speech
and
what
am
i
arrested
for

the

forcing

officers
to
the
couch
where
she
pretended
to
have
just
discovered
the
banker
contemptible
wretch
exclaimed
nucingen
drawing
himself
up
in
financial
majesty
he
placed
himself
between
esther
and
louchard
who
took
off
his
hat
as
contenson
cried
out
monsieur
le

de
at
a
signal
from
louchard
the
bailiffs
vanished
from

left

monsieur

asked

the

added

that
man
really
the
baron
de
nucingen
asked
europe
to
louchard
giving
weight
to
the
doubt
by
a
gesture
which
mademoiselle
dupont
the
low
comedy
servant
of
the

might
have
envied

mademoiselle
said
louchard

the

me
to
say
ein

to

and
her
elderly

retired
to
the

finding
it
necessary
to
apply
his

to
the
keyhole
i

louchard
through

the

cried
esther
clasping
europe
in
her
arms
europe
proceeded
to
melt
into
tears
i
shall
pay
said
the
baron
piteously
as
he
drew
out
a
from
which
he
took
one
of
the
little
printed
forms
which
the
bank
of
france
issues
to
bankers
on
which
they
have
only
to
write
a
sum
in
figures
and
in
words
to
make
them
available
as
cheques
to

it
is
not
worth
the
trouble
monsieur

louchard

the

your

handed
him
three
packets
covered
with
blue
paper

the

took

added
this
philosopher
shrugging

said
asie
and
he
will
give
me
something
for
a
treat
we
bear
no
malice
monsieur
le
baron
added
with
a
horrible
courtesy
louchard
took
the
bills
out
of
the
baron
s
hands
and
remained
alone
with
him
in
the
whither
half
an
hour
later
the
cashier
came
followed
by
contenson
esther
then
reappeared
in
a
bewitching
though
improvised
costume
when
the
money
had
been
counted
by
louchard
the
baron
wished
to
examine
the
bills
but
esther
snatched
them
with
a
grab
and
carried
them
away
to
her
desk
what
will
you
give
the
rabble
said
contenson
to
nucingen
you
hafe
not
shown
much
consideration
said
the
baron
and
what
about
my

cried
contenson
louchard
you
shall
gife
ein
hundert
francs
to
contenson
out
of
the
change
of
the
de
lady
is
a
beauty
said
the
cashier
to
the
baron
as
they
left
the
rue
taitbout
but
she
is
costing
you
ver
dear
monsieur
le
keep
my
segret
said
the
baron
who
had
said
the
same
to
contenson
and
louchard
louchard
went
away
with
contenson
but
on
the
boulevard
asie
who
was
looking
out
for
him
stopped
louchard
the
bailiff
and
the
creditor
are
there
in
a
cab
said
she
they
are
thirsty
and
there
is
money
while
louchard
counted
out
the
cash
contenson
studied
the
customers
he
recognized
carlos
by
his
eyes
and
traced
the
form
of
his
forehead
under
the
wig
the
wig
he
shrewdly
regarded
as
suspicious
he
took
the
number
of
the
cab
while
seeming
quite
indifferent
to
what
was
going
on
asie
and
europe
puzzled
him
beyond
measure
he
thought
that
the
baron
was
the
victim
of
excessively
clever
sharpers
all
the
more
so
because
louchard
when
securing
his
services
had
been
singularly
close
and
besides
the
twist
of
europe
s
foot
had
not
struck
his
shin
only
a
trick
like
that
is
learned
at
he
had
reflected
as
he
got
up
carlos
dismissed
the
bailiff
paying
him
liberally
and
as
he
did
so
said
to
the
driver
of
the
cab
to
the
perron
palais
the
rascal
thought
contenson
as
he
heard
the
order
there
is
something
up
carlos
drove
to
the
palais
royal
at
a
pace
which
precluded
all
fear
of
pursuit
he
made
his
way
in
his
own
fashion
through
the
arcades
took
another
cab
on
the
place
du
chateau
d
eau
and
bid
the
man
go
to
the
passage
de
l
opera
the
end
of
the
rue
a
quarter
of
a
hour
later
he
was
in
the
rue
taitbout
on
seeing
him
esther
said
here
are
the
fatal
carlos
took
the
bills
examined
them
and
then
burned
them
in
the
kitchen
fire
we
have
done
the
trick
he
said
showing
her
three
hundred
and
ten
thousand
francs
in
a
roll
which
he
took
out
of
the
pocket
of
his
coat
this
and
the
hundred
thousand
francs
squeezed
out
by
asie
set
us
free
to
oh
god
oh
god
cried
poor
esther
but
you
idiot
said
the
ferocious
swindler
you
have
only
to
be
ostensibly
nucingen
s
mistress
and
you
can
always
see
lucien
he
is
nucingen
s
friend
i
do
not
forbid
your
being
madly
in
love
with
esther
saw
a
glimmer
of
light
in
her
darkened
life
she
breathed
once
more
europe
my
girl
said
carlos
leading
the
creature
into
a
corner
of
the
boudoir
where
no
one
could
overhear
a
word
europe
i
am
pleased
with
europe
held
up
her
head
and
looked
at
this
man
with
an
expression
which
so
completely
changed
her
faded
features
that
asie
witnessing
the
interview
as
she
watched
her
from
the
door
wondered
whether
the
interest
by
which
carlos
held
europe
might
not
perhaps
be
even
stronger
than
that
by
which
she
herself
was
bound
to
him
that
is
not
all
my
child
four
hundred
thousand
francs
are
a
mere
nothing
to
me
paccard
will
give
you
an
account
for
some
plate
amounting
to
thirty
thousand
francs
on
which
money
has
been
paid
on
account
but
our
goldsmith
biddin
has
paid
money
for
us
our
furniture
seized
by
him
will
no
doubt
be
advertised
go
and
see
biddin
he
lives
in
the
rue
de
l
arbre
sec
he
will
give
you
tickets
for
ten
thousand
francs
you
understand
esther
ordered
the
plate
she
had
not
paid
for
it
and
she
put
it
up
the
spout
she
will
be
in
danger
of
a
little
summons
for
swindling
so
we
must
pay
the
goldsmith
the
thirty
thousand
francs
and
pay
up
ten
thousand
francs
to
the
to
get
the
plate
back
thousand
francs
in
all
including
the
costs
the
silver
is
very
much
alloyed
the
baron
will
give
her
a
new
service
and
we
shall
bone
a
few
thousand
francs
out
of
that
you
owe
what
two
years
account
with
the
dressmaker
put
it
at
six
thousand
francs
replied
europe
well
if
madame
auguste
wants
to
be
paid
and
keep
our
custom
tell
her
to
make
out
a
bill
for
thirty
thousand
francs
over
four
years
make
a
similar
arrangement
with
the
milliner
the
jeweler
samuel
frisch
the
jew
in
the
rue
will
lend
you
some
we
must
owe
him
thousand
francs
and
we
must
want
six
thousand
for
jewels
pledged
at
the
we
will
return
the
trinkets
to
the
jeweler
half
the
stones
will
be
imitation
but
the
baron
will
not
examine
them
in
short
you
will
make
him
fork
out
another
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
to
add
to
our
within
a
madame
might
give
me
a
little
help
said
europe
tell
her
so
for
she
sits
there
mumchance
and
obliges
me
to
find
more
inventions
than
three
authors
for
one
if
esther
turns
prudish
just
let
me
know
said
carlos
nucingen
must
give
her
a
carriage
and
horses
she
will
have
to
choose
and
buy
everything
herself
go
to
the
and
the
coachmaker
who
are
employed
by
the
where
paccard
finds
work
we
shall
get
handsome
horses
very
dear
which
will
go
lame
within
a
month
and
we
shall
have
to
change
we
might
get
six
thousand
francs
out
of
a
perfumer
s
bill
said
europe
oh
said
he
shaking
his
head
we
must
go
gently
nucingen
has
only
got
his
arm
into
the
press
we
must
have
his
head
besides
all
this
i
must
get
five
hundred
thousand
you
can
get
them
replied
europe
madame
will
soften
towards
the
fat
fool
for
about
six
hundred
thousand
and
insist
on
four
hundred
thousand
more
to
love
him
truly
listen
to
me
my
child
said
carlos
the
day
when
i
get
the
last
hundred
thousand
francs
there
shall
be
twenty
thousand
for
what
good
will
they
do
me
said
europe
letting
her
arms
drop
like
a
woman
to
whom
life
seems
impossible
you
could
go
back
to
valenciennes
buy
a
good
business
and
set
up
as
an
honest
woman
if
you
chose
there
are
many
tastes
in
human
nature
paccard
thinks
of
settling
sometimes
he
has
no
encumbrances
on
his
hands
and
not
much
on
his
conscience
you
might
suit
each
other
replied
carlos
go
back
to
valenciennes
what
are
you
thinking
of
monsieur
cried
europe
in
alarm
europe
who
was
born
at
valenciennes
the
child
of
very
poor
parents
had
been
sent
at
seven
years
of
age
to
a
spinning
factory
where
the
demands
of
modern
industry
had
impaired
her
physical
strength
just
as
vice
had
untimely
depraved
her
corrupted
at
the
age
of
twelve
and
a
mother
at
thirteen
she
found
herself
bound
to
the
most
degraded
of
human
creatures
on
the
occasion
of
a
murder
case
she
had
been
as
a
witness
before
the
court
haunted
at
sixteen
by
a
remnant
of
rectitude
and
the
terror
inspired
by
the
law
her
evidence
led
to
the
prisoner
being
sentenced
to
twenty
years
of
hard
labor
the
convict
one
of
those
men
who
have
been
in
the
hands
of
justice
more
than
once
and
whose
temper
is
apt
at
terrible
revenge
had
said
to
the
girl
in
open
court
in
ten
years
as
sure
as
you
live
prudence
europe
s
name
was
prudence
servien
i
will
return
to
be
the
death
of
you
if
i
am
scragged
for
the
president
of
the
court
tried
to
reassure
the
girl
by
promising
her
the
protection
and
the
care
of
the
law
but
the
poor
child
was
so
that
she
fell
ill
and
was
in
hospital
nearly
a
year
justice
is
an
abstract
being
represented
by
a
collection
of
individuals
who
are
incessantly
changing
whose
good
intentions
and
memories
are
like
themselves
liable
to
many
vicissitudes
courts
and
tribunals
can
do
nothing
to
hinder
crimes
their
business
is
to
deal
with
them
when
done
from
this
point
of
view
a
preventive
police
would
be
a
boon
to
a
country
but
the
mere
word
police
is
in
these
days
a
bugbear
to
legislators
who
no
longer
can
distinguish
between
the
three
words
government
administration
and
the
legislator
tends
to
centralize
everything
in
the
state
as
if
the
state
could
act
the
convict
would
be
sure
always
to
remember
his
victim
and
to
avenge
himself
when
justice
had
ceased
to
think
of
either
of
them
prudence
who
instinctively
appreciated
the
danger
in
a
general
sense
so
to
speak
left
valenciennes
and
came
to
paris
at
the
age
of
seventeen
to
hide
there
she
tried
four
trades
of
which
the
most
successful
was
that
of
a
super
at
a
minor
theatre
she
was
picked
up
by
paccard
and
to
him
she
told
her
woes
paccard
jacques
collin
s
disciple
and
man
spoke
of
this
girl
to
his
master
and
when
the
master
needed
a
slave
he
said
to
prudence
if
you
will
serve
me
as
the
devil
must
be
served
i
will
rid
you
of
durut
was
the
convict
the
damocles
sword
hung
over
prudence
servien
s
head
but
for
these
details
many
critics
would
have
thought
europe
s
attachment
somewhat
grotesque
and
no
one
could
have
understood
the
startling
announcement
that
carlos
had
ready
yes
my
girl
you
can
go
back
to
valenciennes

and
he
held
out
to
her

pointing
to
this
paragraph
toulon
yesterday
jean
francois
durut
was
executed
here
early
in
the
morning
the
garrison
etc
prudence
dropped
the
paper
her
legs
gave
way
under
the
weight
of
her
body
she
lived
again
for
to
use
her
own
words
she
never
liked
the
taste
of
her
food
since
the
day
when
durut
had
threatened
her
you
see
i
have
kept
my
word
it
has
taken
four
years
to
bring
durut
to
the
scaffold
by
leading
him
into
a
well

my
job
here
and
you
will
find
yourself
at
the
head
of
a
little
country
business
in
your
native
town
with
twenty
thousand
francs
of
your

up

with
greedy
eyes
all
the
details
of
which
for
twenty
years
the
papers
have
never
been
tired
as
to
the
death
of
convicted
criminals
the
impressive
scene
the
chaplain
who
has
always
converted
the
victim
the
hardened
criminal
preaching
to
his
fellow
convicts
the
battery
of
guns
the
convicts
on
their
knees
and
then
the
twaddle
and
reflections
which
never
lead
to
any
change
in
the
management
of
the
prisons
where
eighteen
hundred
crimes
are
herded
we
must
place
asie
on
the
staff
once
more
said
carlos
asie
came
forward
not
understanding
europe
s
pantomime
in
bringing
her
back
here
as
cook
you
must
begin
by
giving
the
baron
such
a
dinner
as
he
never
ate
in
his
life
he
went
on
tell
him
that
asie
has
lost
all
her
money
at
play
and
has
taken
service
once
more
we
shall
not
need
an
outdoor
servant
paccard
shall
be
coachman
coachmen
do
not
leave
their
box
where
they
are
safe
out
of
the
way
and
he
will
run
less
risk
from
spies
madame
must
turn
him
out
in
a
powdered
wig
and
a
braided
felt
cocked
hat
that
will
alter
his
appearance
besides
i
will
make
him
are
we
going
to
have
in
the
house
asked
asie
with
a
leer
all
honest
folks
said
carlos
all
retorted
the
mulatto
if
the
baron
takes
a
house
paccard
has
a
friend
who
will
suit
as
the
lodge
porter
said
carlos
then
we
shall
only
need
a
footman
and
a
and
you
can
surely
keep
an
eye
on
two
strangers
as
carlos
was
leaving
paccard
made
his
appearance
wait
a
little
while
there
are
people
in
the
street
said
the
man
this
simple
statement
was
alarming
carlos
went
up
to
europe
s
room
and
stayed
there
till
paccard
came
to
fetch
him
having
called
a
hackney
cab
that
came
into
the
courtyard
carlos
pulled
down
the
blinds
and
was
driven
off
at
a
pace
that
defied
pursuit
having
reached
the
faubourg
he
got
out
at
a
short
distance
from
a
hackney
coach
stand
to
which
he
went
on
foot
and
thence
returned
to
the
quai
malaquais
escaping
all
inquiry
here
child
said
he
to
lucien
showing
him
four
hundred
banknotes
for
a
thousand
francs
here
is
something
on
account
for
the
purchase
of
the
estates
of
rubempre
we
will
risk
a
hundred
thousand
omnibuses
have
just
been
started
the
parisians
will
take
to
the
novelty
in
three
months
we
shall
have
trebled
our
capital
i
know
the
concern
they
will
pay
splendid
dividends
taken
out
of
the
capital
to
put
a
head
on
the
shares
an
old
idea
of
nucingen
s
revived
if
we
acquire
the
rubempre
land
we
shall
not
have
to
pay
on
the
nail
you
must
go
and
see
des
lupeaulx
and
beg
him
to
give
you
a
personal
recommendation
to
a
lawyer
named
desroches
a
cunning
dog
whom
you
must
call
on
at
his
office
get
him
to
go
to
rubempre
and
see
how
the
land
lies
promise
him
a
premium
of
twenty
thousand
francs
if
he
manages
to
secure
you
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
by
investing
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
in
land
round
the
ruins
of
the
old
how
you
go
on
on
on
i
am
always
going
on
this
is
no
time
for
you
must
then
invest
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
in
treasury
bonds
so
as
to
lose
no
interest
you
may
safely
leave
it
to
desroches
he
is
as
honest
as
he
is
that
being
done
get
off
to
angouleme
and
persuade
your
sister
and
your
to
pledge
themselves
to
a
little
fib
in
the
way
of
business
your
relations
are
to
have
given
you
six
hundred
thousand
francs
to
promote
your
marriage
with
clotilde
de
grandlieu
there
is
no
disgrace
in
we
are
saved
cried
lucien
dazzled
you
are
yes
replied
carlos
but
even
you
are
not
safe
till
you
walk
out
of
d
aquin
with
clotilde
as
your
and
what
have
you
to
fear
said
lucien
apparently
much
concerned
for
his
counselor
some
inquisitive
souls
are
on
my
track
i
must
assume
the
manners
of
a
genuine
priest
it
is
most
annoying
the
devil
will
cease
to
protect
me
if
he
sees
me
with
a
breviary
under
my
at
this
moment
the
baron
de
nucingen
who
was
leaning
on
his
cashier
s
arm
reached
the
door
of
his
mansion
i

the

german
whose
whole

was
for

said
this
louis
xiv
of
the
feeling
sure
that
sooner
or
later
esther
would
be
his
the
baron
was
now
himself
again
a
masterly
financier
he
resumed
the
management
of
his
affairs
and
with
such
effect
that
his
cashier
finding
him
in
his
office
room
at
six
o
clock
next
morning
verifying
his
securities
rubbed
his
hands
with
satisfaction
ah
ha
mein
herr
baron
you
shall
hafe
saved
money
last
night
said
he
with
a
german
grin
though
men
who
are
as
rich
as
the
baron
de
nucingen
have
more
opportunities
than
others
for
losing
money
they
also
have
more
chances
of
making
it
even
when
they
indulge
their
follies
though
the
financial
policy
of
the
house
of
nucingen
has
been
explained
elsewhere
it
may
be
as
well
to
point
out
that
such
immense
fortunes
are
not
made
are
not
built
up
are
not
increased
and
are
not
retained
in
the
midst
of
the
commercial
political
and
industrial
revolutions
of
the
present
day
but
at
the
cost
of
immense
losses
or
if
you
choose
to
view
it
so
of
heavy
taxes
on
private
fortunes
very
little
wealth
is
thrown
into
the
common
treasury
of
the
world
every
fresh
accumulation
represents
some
new
inequality
in
the
general
distribution
of
wealth
what
the
state
exacts
it
makes
some
return
for
but
what
a
house
like
that
of
nucingen
takes
it
keeps
such
covert
robbery
escapes
the
law
for
the
reason
which
would
have
made
a
jacques
collin
of
frederick
the
great
if
instead
of
dealing
with
provinces
by
means
of
battles
he
had
dealt
in
smuggled
goods
or
transferable
securities
the
high
politics
of
consist
in
forcing
the
states
of
europe
to
issue
loans
at
twenty
or
at
ten
per
cent
in
making
that
twenty
or
ten
per
cent
by
the
use
of
public
funds
in
squeezing
industry
on
a
vast
scale
by
buying
up
raw
material
in
throwing
a
rope
to
the
first
founder
of
a
business
just
to
keep
him
above
water
till
his
enterprise
is
safely
landed
in
short
in
all
the
great
battles
for
the
banker
no
doubt
like
the
conqueror
runs
risks
but
there
are
so
few
men
in
a
position
to
wage
this
warfare
that
the
sheep
have
no
business
to
meddle
such
grand
struggles
are
between
the
shepherds
thus
as
the
defaulters
are
guilty
of
having
wanted
to
win
too
much
very
little
sympathy
is
felt
as
a
rule
for
the
misfortunes
brought
about
by
the
coalition
of
the
nucingens
if
a
speculator
blows
his
brains
out
if
a
stockbroker
bolts
if
a
lawyer
makes
off
with
the
fortune
of
a
hundred
families
which
is
far
worse
than
killing
a
man
if
a
banker
is
insolvent
all
these
catastrophes
are
forgotten
in
paris
in
few
months
and
buried
under
the
oceanic
surges
of
the
great
city
the
colossal
fortunes
of
jacques
coeur
of
the
medici
of
the
angos
of
dieppe
of
the
auffredis
of
la
rochelle
of
the
fuggers
of
the
tiepolos
of
the
corners
were
honestly
made
long
ago
by
the
advantages
they
had
over
the
ignorance
of
the
people
as
to
the
sources
of
precious
products
but
nowadays
geographical
information
has
reached
the
masses
and
competition
has
so
effectually
limited
the
profits
that
every
rapidly
made
fortune
is
the
result
of
chance
or
of
a
discovery
or
of
some
legalized
robbery
the
lower
grades
of
mercantile
enterprise
have
retorted
on
the
perfidious
dealings
of
higher
commerce
especially
during
the
last
ten
years
by
base
adulteration
of
the
raw
material
wherever
chemistry
is
practised
wine
is
no
longer
procurable
the
vine
industry
is
consequently
waning
manufactured
salt
is
sold
to
avoid
the
excise
the
tribunals
are
appalled
by
this
universal
dishonesty
in
short
french
trade
is
regarded
with
suspicion
by
the
whole
world
and
england
too
is
fast
being
demoralized
with
us
the
mischief
has
its
origin
in
the
political
situation
the
charter
proclaimed
the
reign
of
money
and
success
has
become
the
supreme
consideration
of
an
atheistic
age
and
indeed
the
corruption
of
the
higher
ranks
is
infinitely
more
hideous
in
spite
of
the
dazzling
display
and
specious
arguments
of
wealth
than
that
ignoble
and
more
personal
corruption
of
the
inferior
classes
of
which
certain
details
lend
a
comic
element
terrible
if
you
will
to
this
drama
the
government
always
alarmed
by
a
new
idea
has
banished
these
materials
of
modern
comedy
from
the
stage
the
citizen
class
less
liberal
than
louis
dreads
the
advent
of
its
de
forbids
the
appearance
of
a
political
and
certainly
would
not
allow
to
be
represented
for
turcaret
is
king
consequently
comedy
has
to
be
narrated
and
a
book
is
now
the
weapon
less
swift
but
no
more
sure
that
writers
wield
in
the
course
of
this
morning
amid
the
coming
and
going
of
callers
orders
to
be
given
and
brief
interviews
making
nucingen
s
private
office
a
sort
of
financial
lobby
one
of
his
stockbrokers
announced
to
him
the
disappearance
of
a
member
of
the
company
one
of
the
richest
and
cleverest
too
jacques
falleix
brother
of
martin
falleix
and
the
successor
of
jules
desmarets
jacques
falleix
was
stockbroker
in
ordinary
to
the
house
of
nucingen
in
concert
with
du
tillet
and
the
kellers
the
baron
had
plotted
the
ruin
of
this
man
in
cold
blood
as
if
it
had
been
the
killing
of
a
passover
lamb
he
could
not
hafe
helt
on
replied
the
baron
quietly
jacques
falleix
had
done
them
immense
service
in
during
a
crisis
a
few
months
since
he
had
saved
the
situation
by
acting
boldly
but
to
look
for
gratitude
from
a
is
as
vain
as
to
try
to
touch
the
heart
of
the
wolves
of
the
ukraine
in
winter
poor
fellow
said
the
stockbroker
he
so
little
anticipated
such
a
catastrophe
that
he
had
furnished
a
little
house
for
his
mistress
in
the
rue
he
has
spent
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
in
decorations
and
furniture
he
was
so
devoted
to
madame
du
the
poor
woman
must
give
it
all
up
and
nothing
is
paid
goot
goot
thought
nucingen
dis
is
de
very
chance
to
make
up
for
vat
i
hafe
lost
dis
night
he
hafe
paid
for
noting
he
asked
his
informant
why
said
the
stockbroker
where
would
you
find
a
tradesman
so
ill
informed
as
to
refuse
credit
to
jacques
falleix
there
is
a
splendid
cellar
of
wine
it
would
seem
by
the
way
the
house
is
for
sale
he
meant
to
buy
it
the
lease
is
in
his
what
a
piece
of
folly
plate
furniture
wine
everything
will
be
valued
in
a
lump
and
what
will
the
creditors
get
out
of
it
come
again
said
nucingen
i
shall
hafe
seen
all
dat
and
if
it
is
not
a
declared
bankruptcy
if
tings
can
be
arranged
and
compromised
i
shall
tell
you
to
offer
some
reasonaple
price
for
dat
furniture
if
i
shall
buy
de
lease
that
can
be
managed
said
his
friend
if
you
go
there
this
morning
you
will
find
one
of
falleix
s
partners
there
with
the
tradespeople
who
want
to
establish
a
first
claim
but
la
has
their
accounts
made
out
to
the
baron
sent
off
one
of
his
clerks
forthwith
to
his
lawyer
jacques
falleix
had
spoken
to
him
about
this
house
which
was
worth
sixty
thousand
francs
at
most
and
he
wished
to
be
put
in
possession
of
it
at
once
so
as
to
avail
himself
of
the
privileges
of
the
householder
the
cashier
honest
man
came
to
inquire
whether
his
master
had
lost
anything
by
falleix

the
baron
s

at
the
bourse
but
he
could
not
bear
to
leave
his
house
in
the
rue
without
going
to
the
rue
taitbout
he
was
already
miserable
at
having
been
away
from
esther
for
so
many
hours
he
would
have
liked
to
keep
her
at
his
elbow
the
profits
he
hoped
to
make
out
of
his
stockbrokers
plunder
made
the
former
loss
of
four
hundred
thousand
francs
quite
easy
to
endure
delighted
to
announce
to
his
anchel
that
she
was
to
move
from
the
rue
taitbout
to
the
rue
where
she
was
to
have
ein
little
palace
where
her
memories
would
no
longer
rise
up
in
antagonism
to
their
happiness
the
pavement
felt
elastic
under
his
feet
he
walked
like
a
young
man
in
a
young
man
s
dream
as
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
trois
freres
in
the
middle
of
his
dream
and
of
the
road
the
baron
beheld
europe
coming
towards
him
looking
very
much
upset
vere
shall
you
go
he
asked
well
monsieur
i
was
on
my
way
to
you
you
were
quite
right
yesterday
i
see
now
that
poor
madame
had
better
have
gone
to
prison
for
a
few
days
but
how
should
women
understand
money
matters
when
madame
s
creditors
heard
that
she
had
come
home
they
all
came
down
upon
us
like
birds
of
last
evening
at
seven
o
clock
monsieur
men
came
and
stuck
terrible
posters
up
to
announce
a
sale
of
furniture
on
saturday
but
that
is
madame
who
is
all
heart
once
upon
a
time
to
oblige
that
wretch
of
a
man
you
know
vat
wretch
well
the
man
she
was
in
love
with
d
estourny
well
he
was
charming
he
was
only
a
gambler
he
gambled
with
beveled
cards
well
and
what
do
you
do
at
the
bourse
said
europe
but
let
me
go
on
one
day
to
hinder
georges
as
he
said
from
blowing
out
his
brains
she
pawned
all
her
plate
and
her
jewels
which
had
never
been
paid
for
now
on
hearing
that
she
had
given
something
to
one
of
her
creditors
they
came
in
a
body
and
made
a
scene
they
threaten
her
with
the
your
angel
at
that
bar
is
it
not
enough
to
make
a
wig
stand
on
end
she
is
bathed
in
tears
she
talks
of
throwing
herself
into
the
river
and
she
will
do
if
i
shall
go
to
see
her
dat
is
to
de
bourse
an
it
is
impossible
but
i
shall
go
for
i
shall
make
some
money
for
her
you
shall
compose
her
i
shall
pay
her
debts
i
shall
go
to
see
her
at
four
o
clock
but
tell
me
eugenie
dat
she
shall
lofe

a
little
a
little
a
great
deal
i
tell
you
what
monsieur
nothing
but
generosity
can
win

heart
you
would
no
doubt
have
saved
a
hundred
thousand
francs
or
so
by
letting
her
go
to
prison
well
you
would
never
have
won
her

months
the

certain
glow

you
have
spent
a
little
money
do
not
let
that
worry
you
you
will
see
what
a
good
return
it
will
bring
and
i
said
to
madame
i
told
her
she
would
be
the
lowest
of
the
low
a
perfect
hussy
if
she
did
not
love
you
for

she
has
nothing
on
her
mind
you
will
see
between

i
may
tell
you
that
night
when
she
cried
so
much
what
is
to

said
we
value
the
esteem
of
the
man
who
maintains
us
and
she
did
not
dare
tell
you
everything
she
wanted
to
to
fly
cried
the
baron
in
dismay
at
the
notion
but
the
bourse
the
bourse

vay
i
shall
not
come
but
tell
her
that
i
shall
see
her
at
her
window

gife

courage
esther
smiled
at
monsieur
de
nucingen
as
he
passed
the
house
and
he
went
ponderously
on
his
way
saying
she
is
ein
anchel
this
was
how
europe
had
succeeded
in
achieving
the
impossible
at
about
two
esther
had
finished
dressing
as
she
was
wont
to
dress
when
she
expected
lucien
she
was
looking
charming
seeing
this
prudence
looking
out
of
the
window
said
there
is
monsieur
the
poor
creature
flew
to
the
window
thinking
she
would
see
lucien
she
saw
nucingen
oh
how
cruelly
you
hurt
me
she
said
there
is
no
other
way
of
getting
you
to
seem
to
be
gracious
to
a
poor
old
man
who
after
all
is
going
to
pay
your
debts
said
europe
for
they
are
all
to
be
what
debts
said
the
girl
who
only
cared
to
preserve
her
love
which
dreadful
hands
were
scattering
to
the
winds
those
which
monsieur
carlos
made
in
your
why
here
are
nearly
four
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
cried
esther
and
you
owe
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
more
but
the
baron
took
it
all
very
he
is
going
to
remove
you
from
hence
and
place
you
in
a
little
on
my
honor
you
are
not
so
badly
off
in
your
place
as
you
have
got
on
the
right
side
of
this
man
as
soon
as
carlos
is
satisfied
i
should
make
him
give
me
a
house
and
a
settled
income
you
are
certainly
the
handsomest
woman
i
ever
saw
madame
and
the
most
attractive
but
we
so
soon
grow
ugly
i
was
fresh
and
and
look
at
me
i
am
about
the
same
age
as
madame
and
i
look
ten
years
older
an
illness
is
well
but
when
you
have
a
house
in
paris
and
investments
you
need
never
be
afraid
of
ending
in
the
esther
had
ceased
to
listen
to
servien
the
will
of
a
man
gifted
with
the
genius
of
corruption
had
thrown
esther
back
into
the
mud
with
as
much
force
as
he
had
used
to
drag
her
out
of
it
those
who
know
love
in
its
infinitude
know
that
those
who
do
not
accept
its
virtues
do
not
experience
its
pleasures
since
the
scene
in
the
den
in
the
rue
de
langlade
esther
had
utterly
forgotten
her
former
existence
she
had
since
lived
very
virtuously
cloistered
by
her
passion
hence
to
avoid
any
obstacle
the
skilful
fiend
had
been
clever
enough
to
lay
such
a
train
that
the
poor
girl
prompted
by
her
devotion
had
merely
to
utter
her
consent
to
swindling
actions
already
done
or
on
the
point
of
accomplishment
this
subtlety
revealing
the
mastery
of
the
tempter
also
characterized
the
methods
by
which
he
had
subjugated
lucien
he
created
a
terrible
situation
dug
a
mine
filled
it
with
powder
and
at
the
critical
moment
said
to
his
accomplice
you
have
only
to
nod
and
the
whole
will
explode
esther
of
old
knowing
only
the
morality
peculiar
to
courtesans
thought
all
these
attentions
so
natural
that
she
measured
her
rivals
only
by
what
they
could
get
men
to
spend
on
them
ruined
fortunes
are
the
of
these
creatures
carlos
in
counting
on
esther
s
memory
had
not
calculated
wrongly
these
tricks
of
warfare
these
stratagems
employed
a
thousand
times
not
only
by
these
women
but
by
spendthrifts
too
did
not
disturb
esther
s
mind
she
felt
nothing
but
her
personal
degradation
she
loved
lucien
she
was
to
be
the
baron
de
nucingen
s
mistress
by
appointment
this
was
all
she
thought
of
the
supposed
spaniard
might
absorb
the
lucien
might
build
up
his
fortune
with
the
stones
of
her
tomb
a
single
night
of
pleasure
might
cost
the
old
banker
so
many
notes
more
or
less
europe
might
extract
a
few
hundred
thousand
francs
by
more
or
less
ingenious
trickery
none
of
these
things
troubled
the
enamored
girl
this
alone
was
the
canker
that
ate
into
her
heart
for
five
years
she
had
looked
upon
herself
as
being
as
white
as
an
angel
she
loved
she
was
happy
she
had
never
committed
the
smallest
infidelity
this
beautiful
pure
love
was
now
to
be
defiled
there
was
in
her
mind
no
conscious
contrasting
of
her
happy
isolated
past
and
her
foul
future
life
it
was
neither
interest
nor
sentiment
that
moved
her
only
an
indefinable
and
all
powerful
feeling
that
she
had
been
white
and
was
now
black
pure
and
was
now
impure
noble
and
was
now
ignoble
desiring
to
be
the
ermine
moral
taint
seemed
to
her
unendurable
and
when
the
baron
s
passion
had
threatened
her
she
had
really
thought
of
throwing
herself
out
of
the
window
in
short
she
loved
lucien
wholly
and
as
women
very
rarely
love
a
man
women
who
say
they
love
who
often
think
they
love
best
dance
waltz
and
flirt
with
other
men
dress
for
the
world
and
look
for
a
harvest
of
concupiscent
glances
but
esther
without
any
sacrifice
had
achieved
miracles
of
true
love
she
had
loved
lucien
for
six
years
as
actresses
love
and
courtesans
women
who
having
rolled
in
mire
and
impurity
thirst
for
something
noble
for
the
of
true
love
and
who
practice
exclusiveness
the
only
word
for
an
idea
so
little
known
in
real
life
vanished
nations
greece
rome
and
the
east
have
at
all
times
kept
women
shut
up
the
woman
who
loves
should
shut
herself
up
so
it
may
easily
be
imagined
that
on
quitting
the
palace
of
her
fancy
where
this
poem
had
been
enacted
to
go
to
this
old
man
s
little
palace
esther
felt
heartsick
urged
by
an
iron
hand
she
had
found
herself
in
disgrace
before
she
had
time
to
reflect
but
for
the
past
two
days
she
had
been
reflecting
and
felt
a
mortal
chill
about
her
heart
at
the
words
end
in
the
street
she
started
to
her
feet
and
said
in
the
street
no
in
the
seine
in
the
seine
and
what
about
monsieur
lucien
said
europe
this
single
word
brought
esther
to
her
seat
again
she
remained
in
her
armchair
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
rosette
in
the
carpet
the
fire
in
her
brain
drying
up
her
tears
at
four
o
clock
nucingen
found
his
angel
lost
in
that
sea
of
meditations
and
resolutions
whereon
a
woman
s
spirit
floats
and
whence
she
emerges
with
utterances
that
are
incomprehensible
to
those
who
have
not
sailed
it
in
her
convoy
clear
your
brow
meine

said
the
baron
sitting
down
by
her

but
not
de
heart
and
it
is
dat
heart
i
lofe
the
words
were
spoken
with
such
sincerity
of
accent
that
poor
esther
looked
at
the
old
man
with
a
compassion
in
her
eyes
that
almost
maddened
him
lovers
like
martyrs
feel
a
brotherhood
in
their
sufferings
nothing
in
the
world
gives
such
a
sense
of
kindred
as
community
of
sorrow
poor
man
said
she
he
really
as
he
heard
the
words
misunderstanding
their
meaning
the
baron
turned
pale
the
blood
tingled
in
his
veins
he
breathed
the
airs
of
heaven
at
his
age
a
millionaire
for
such
a
sensation
will
pay
as
much
gold
as
a
woman
can
ask
i
lofe
you

daughter
said
he
an

and
he
laid
her
hand
over
his
heart
dat
i
shall
not
bear
to
see
you
anyting
but
if
you
would
only
be
a
father
to
me
i
would
love
you
very
much
i
would
never
leave
you
and
you
would
see
that
i
am
not
a
bad
woman
not
grasping
or
greedy
as
i
must
seem
to
you
now
you

done
some
little
follies
said
the
baron
like
all
dose
pretty

all
say
no
more
about
dat
it
is
our
pusiness
to
make
money
for

be
your
fater
for
some
days
yet
for
i
know
i
must
make
you
accustom
to
my
old
really
she
exclaimed
springing
on
to
nucingen
s
knees
and
clinging
to
him
with
her
arm
round
his
neck
really
repeated
he
trying
to
force
a
smile
she
kissed
his
forehead
she
believed
in
an
impossible
combination
she
might
remain
untouched
and
see
lucien
she
was
so
coaxing
to
the
banker
that
she
was
la
torpille
once
more
she
fairly
bewitched
the
old
man
who
promised
to
be
a
father
to
her
for
forty
days
those
forty
days
were
to
be
employed
in
acquiring
and
arranging
the
house
in
the
rue
when
he
was
in
the
street
again
as
he
went
home
the
baron
said
to
himself
i
am
an
old
but
though
in
esther
s
presence
he
was
a
mere
child
away
from
her
he
resumed
his
lynx
s
skin
just
as
the
gambler
in
becomes
affectionate
to
angelique
when
he
has
not
a
liard
a
half
a
million
francs
i
hafe
paid
and
i
hafe
not
yet
seen
vat
her
leg
is
dat
is
too
silly
but
happily
nobody
shall
hafe
known
it
said
he
to
himself
three
weeks
after
and
he
made
great
resolutions
to
come
to
the
point
with
the
woman
who
had
cost
him
so
dear
then
in
esther
s
presence
once
more
he
spent
all
the
time
he
could
spare
her
in
making
up
for
the
roughness
of
his
first
words
after
all
said
he
at
the
end
of
a
month
i
can
not
be
de
fater
eternal
towards
the
end
of
the
month
of
december
just
before
installing
esther
in
the
house
in
the
rue
the
baron
begged
du
tillet
to
take
florine
there
that
she
might
see
whether
everything
was
suitable
to
nucingen
s
fortune
and
if
the
description
of
a
little
palace
were
duly
realized
by
the
artists
commissioned
to
make
the
cage
worthy
of
the
bird
every
device
known
to
luxury
before
the
revolution
of
made
this
residence
a
masterpiece
of
taste
grindot
the
architect
considered
it
his
greatest
achievement
as
a
decorator
the
staircase
which
had
been
reconstructed
of
marble
the
judicious
use
of
stucco
ornament
textiles
and
gilding
the
smallest
details
as
much
as
the
general
effect
outdid
everything
of
the
kind
left
in
paris
from
the
time
of
louis
xv
this
is
my
dream
this
and
virtue
said
florine
with
a
smile
and
for
whom
are
you
spending
all
this
money
for
a
voman
vat
is
going
up
there
replied
the
baron
a
way
of
playing
jupiter
replied
the
actress
and
when
is
she
on
show
on
the
day
of
the
cried
du
tillet
not
before
dat
said
the
baron
my
word
how
we
must
lace
and
brush
and
fig
ourselves
out
florine
went
on
what
a
dance
the
women
will
lead
their
dressmakers
and
hairdressers
for
that
evening
s
fun
and
when
is
it
to
be
dat
is
not
for
me
to
what
a
woman
she
must
be
cried
florine
how
much
i
should
like
to
see
her
an
so
should
i
answered
the
baron
artlessly
what
is
everything
new
together
the
house
the
furniture
and
the
woman
even
the
banker
said
du
tillet
for
my
old
friend
seems
to
me
quite
young
well
he
must
go
back
to
his
twentieth
year
said
florine
at
any
rate
for
in
the
early
days
of
everybody
in
paris
was
talking
of
nucingen
s
passion
and
the
outrageous
splendor
of
his
house
the
poor
baron
pointed
at
laughed
at
and
fuming
with
rage
as
may
easily
be
imagined
took
it
into
his
head
that
on
the
occasion
of
giving
the
he
would
at
the
same
time
get
rid
of
his
paternal
disguise
and
get
the
price
of
so
much
generosity
always
circumvented
by
la
torpille
he
determined
to
treat
of
their
union
by
correspondence
so
as
to
win
from
her
an
autograph
promise
bankers
have
no
faith
in
anything
less
than
a
promissory
note
so
one
morning
early
in
the
year
he
rose
early
locked
himself
into
his
room
and
composed
the
following
letter
in
very
good
french
for
though
he
spoke
the
language
very
badly
he
could
write
it
very
well
dear
esther
the
flower
of
my
thoughts
and
the
only
joy
of
my
life
when
i
told
you
that
i
loved
you
as
i
love
my
daughter
i
deceived
you
i
deceived
myself
i
only
wished
to
express
the
holiness
of
my
sentiments
which
are
unlike
those
felt
by
other
men
in
the
first
place
because
i
am
an
old
man
and
also
because
i
have
never
loved
till
now
i
love
you
so
much
that
if
you
cost
me
my
fortune
i
should
not
love
you
the
less
be
just
most
men
would
not
like
me
have
seen
the
angel
in
you
i
have
never
even
glanced
at
your
past
i
love
you
both
as
i
love
my
daughter
augusta
and
as
i
might
love
my
wife
if
my
wife
could
have
loved
me
since
the
only
excuse
for
an
old
man
s
love
is
that
he
should
be
happy
ask
yourself
if
i
am
not
playing
a
too
ridiculous
part
i
have
taken
you
to
be
the
consolation
and
joy
of
my
declining
days
you
know
that
till
i
die
you
will
be
as
happy
as
a
woman
can
be
and
you
know
too
that
after
my
death
you
will
be
rich
enough
to
be
the
envy
of
many
women
in
every
stroke
of
business
i
have
effected
since
i
have
had
the
happiness
of
your
acquaintance
your
share
is
set
apart
and
you
have
a
standing
account
with
nucingen
s
bank
in
a
few
days
you
will
move
into
a
house
which
sooner
or
later
will
be
your
own
if
you
like
it
now
plainly
will
you
still
receive
me
then
as
a
father
or
will
you
make
me
happy
forgive
me
for
writing
so
frankly
but
when
i
am
with
you
i
lose
all
courage
i
feel
too
keenly
that
you
are
indeed
my
mistress
i
have
no
wish
to
hurt
you
i
only
want
to
tell
you
how
much
i
suffer
and
how
hard
it
is
to
wait
at
my
age
when
every
day
takes
with
it
some
hopes
and
some
pleasures
besides
the
delicacy
of
my
conduct
is
a
guarantee
of
the
sincerity
of
my
intentions
have
i
ever
behaved
as
your
creditor
you
are
like
a
citadel
and
i
am
not
a
young
man
in
answer
to
my
appeals
you
say
your
life
is
at
stake
and
when
i
hear
you
you
make
me
believe
it
but
here
i
sink
into
dark
melancholy
and
doubts
dishonorable
to
us
both
you
seemed
to
me
as
sweet
and
innocent
as
you
are
lovely
but
you
insist
on
destroying
my
convictions
ask
yourself
you
tell
me
you
bear
a
passion
in
your
heart
an
indomitable
passion
but
you
refuse
to
tell
me
the
name
of
the
man
you
is
this
natural
you
have
turned
a
fairly
strong
man
into
an
incredibly
weak
one
you
see
what
i
have
come
to
i
am
induced
to
ask
you
at
the
end
of
five
months
what
future
hope
there
is
for
my
passion
again
i
must
know
what
part
i
am
to
play
at
the
opening
of
your
house
money
is
nothing
to
me
when
it
is
spent
for
you
i
will
not
be
so
absurd
as
to
make
a
merit
to
you
of
this
contempt
but
though
my
love
knows
no
limits
my
fortune
is
limited
and
i
care
for
it
only
for
your
sake
well
if
by
giving
you
everything
i
possess
i
might
as
a
poor
man
win
your
affection
i
would
rather
be
poor
and
loved
than
rich
and
scorned
by
you
you
have
altered
me
so
completely
my
dear
esther
that
no
one
knows
me
i
paid
ten
thousand
francs
for
a
picture
by
joseph
bridau
because
you
told
me
that
he
was
clever
and
unappreciated
i
give
every
beggar
i
meet
five
francs
in
your
name
well
and
what
does
the
poor
man
ask
who
regards
himself
as
your
debtor
when
you
do
him
the
honor
of
accepting
anything
he
can
give
you
he
asks
only
for
a
hope
and
what
a
hope
good
god
is
it
not
rather
the
certainty
of
never
having
anything
from
you
but
what
my
passion
may
seize
the
fire
in
my
heart
will
abet
your
cruel
deceptions
you
find
me
ready
to
submit
to
every
condition
you
can
impose
on
my
happiness
on
my
few
pleasures
but
promise
me
at
least
that
on
the
day
when
you
take
possession
of
your
house
you
will
accept
the
heart
and
service
of
him
who
for
the
rest
of
his
days
must
sign
himself
your
slave
frederic
de
faugh
how
he
bores
me
this
money
bag
cried
esther
a
courtesan
once
more
she
took
a
small
sheet
of
notepaper
and
wrote
all
over
it
as
close
as
it
could
go
scribe
s
famous
phrase
which
has
become
a
proverb
prenez
mon
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
esther
overcome
by
remorse
wrote
the
following
letter
monsieur
le
baron
pay
no
heed
to
the
note
you
have
just
received
from
me
i
had
relapsed
into
the
folly
of
my
youth
forgive
monsieur
a
poor
girl
who
ought
to
be
your
slave
i
never
more
keenly
felt
the
degradation
of
my
position
than
on
the
day
when
i
was
handed
over
to
you
you
have
paid
i
owe
myself
to
you
there
is
nothing
more
sacred
than
a
debt
of
dishonor
i
have
no
right
to
compound
it
by
throwing
myself
into
the
seine
a
debt
can
always
be
discharged
in
that
dreadful
coin
which
is
good
only
to
the
debtor
you
will
find
me
yours
to
command
i
will
pay
off
in
one
night
all
the
sums
for
which
that
fatal
hour
has
been
mortgaged
and
i
am
sure
that
such
an
hour
with
me
is
worth
millions
all
the
more
because
it
will
be
the
only
one
the
last
i
shall
then
have
paid
the
debt
and
may
get
away
from
life
a
good
woman
has
a
chance
of
restoration
after
a
fall
but
we
the
like
of
us
fall
too
low
my
determination
is
so
fixed
that
i
beg
you
will
keep
this
letter
in
evidence
of
the
cause
of
death
of
her
who
remains
for
one
day
your
servant
having
sent
this
letter
esther
felt
a
pang
of
regret
ten
minutes
after
she
wrote
a
third
note
as
follows
forgive
me
dear
baron
it
is
i
once
more
i
did
not
mean
either
to
make
game
of
you
or
to
wound
you
i
only
want
you
to
reflect
on
this
simple
argument
if
we
were
to
continue
in
the
position
towards
each
other
of
father
and
daughter
your
pleasure
would
be
small
but
it
would
be
enduring
if
you
insist
on
the
terms
of
the
bargain
you
will
live
to
mourn
for
me
i
will
trouble
you
no
more
the
day
when
you
shall
choose
pleasure
rather
than
happiness
will
have
no
morrow
for
your
daughter
on
receiving
the
first
letter
the
baron
fell
into
a
cold
fury
such
as
a
millionaire
may
die
of
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
and
rang
the
bell
an
hot
bat
for
mein
feet
said
he
to
his
new
valet
while
he
was
sitting
with
his
feet
in
the
bath
the
second
letter
came
he
read
it
and
fainted
away
he
was
carried
to
bed
when
the
banker
recovered
consciousness
madame
de
nucingen
was
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
the
hussy
is
right
said
she
why
do
you
try
to
buy
love
is
it
to
be
bought
in
the
market
let
me
see
your
letter
to
the
baron
gave
her
sundry
rough
drafts
he
had
made
madame
de
nucingen
read
them
and
smiled
then
came
esther
s
third
letter
she
is
a
wonderful
girl
cried
the
baroness
when
she
had
read
it
vat
shall
i
do
montame
asked
the
baron
of
his
wife
wait
but
nature
is
pitiless
he
cried
look
here
my
dear
you
have
been
admirably
kind
to
me
said
delphine
i
will
give
you
some
good
you
are
a
ver
goot
voman
said
he
ven
you
hafe
any
debts
i
shall
your
state
on
receiving
these
letters
touches
a
woman
far
more
than
the
spending
of
millions
or
than
all
the
letters
you
could
write
however
fine
they
may
be
try
to
let
her
know
it
indirectly
perhaps
she
will
be
yours
and
have
no
scruples
she
will
not
die
of
that
added
she
looking
keenly
at
her
husband
but
madame
de
nucingen
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
nature
of
such
women
vat
a
clefer
voman
is
montame
de
nucingen
said
the
baron
to
himself
when
his
wife
had
left
him
still
the
more
the
baron
admired
the
subtlety
of
his
wife
s
counsel
the
less
he
could
see
how
he
might
act
upon
it
and
he
not
only
felt
that
he
was
stupid
but
he
told
himself
so
the
stupidity
of
wealthy
men
though
it
is
almost
proverbial
is
only
comparative
the
faculties
of
the
mind
like
the
dexterity
of
the
limbs
need
exercise
the
dancer
s
strength
is
in
his
feet
the
blacksmith
s
in
his
arms
the
market
porter
is
trained
to
carry
loads
the
singer
works
his
larynx
and
the
pianist
hardens
his
wrist
a
banker
is
practised
in
business
matters
he
studies
and
plans
them
and
pulls
the
wires
of
various
interests
just
as
a
playwright
trains
his
intelligence
in
combining
situations
studying
his
actors
giving
life
to
his
dramatic
figures
we
should
no
more
look
for
powers
of
conversation
in
the
baron
de
nucingen
than
for
the
imagery
of
a
poet
in
the
brain
of
a
mathematician
how
many
poets
occur
in
an
age
who
are
either
good
prose
writers
or
as
witty
in
the
intercourse
of
daily
life
as
madame
cornuel
buffon
was
dull
company
newton
was
never
in
love
lord
byron
loved
nobody
but
himself
rousseau
was
gloomy
and
half
crazy
la
fontaine
human
energy
equally
distributed
produces
dolts
mediocrity
in
all
unequally
bestowed
it
gives
rise
to
those
incongruities
to
whom
the
name
of
genius
is
given
and
which
if
we
only
could
see
them
would
look
like
deformities
the
same
law
governs
the
body
perfect
beauty
is
generally
allied
with
coldness
or
silliness
though
pascal
was
both
a
great
mathematician
and
a
great
writer
though
beaumarchais
was
a
good
man
of
business
and
zamet
a
profound
courtier
these
rare
exceptions
prove
the
general
principle
of
the
specialization
of
brain
faculties
within
the
sphere
of
speculative
calculations
the
banker
put
forth
as
much
intelligence
and
skill
finesse
and
mental
power
as
a
practised
diplomatist
expends
on
national
affairs
if
he
were
equally
remarkable
outside
his
office
the
banker
would
be
a
great
man
nucingen
made
one
with
the
prince
de
ligne
with
mazarin
or
with
diderot
is
a
human
formula
that
is
almost
inconceivable
but
which
has
nevertheless
been
known
as
pericles
aristotle
voltaire
and
napoleon
the
splendor
of
the
imperial
crown
must
not
blind
us
to
the
merits
of
the
individual
the
emperor
was
charming
well
informed
and
witty
monsieur
de
nucingen
a
banker
and
nothing
more
having
no
inventiveness
outside
his
business
like
most
bankers
had
no
faith
in
anything
but
sound
security
in
matters
of
art
he
had
the
good
sense
to
go
cash
in
hand
to
experts
in
every
branch
and
had
recourse
to
the
best
architect
the
best
surgeon
the
greatest
connoisseur
in
pictures
or
statues
the
cleverest
lawyer
when
he
wished
to
build
a
house
to
attend
to
his
health
to
purchase
a
work
of
art
or
an
estate
but
as
there
are
no
recognized
experts
in
intrigue
no
connoisseurs
in
love
affairs
a
banker
finds
himself
in
difficulties
when
he
is
in
love
and
much
puzzled
as
to
the
management
of
a
woman
so
nucingen
could
think
of
no
better
method
than
that
he
had
hitherto
pursued
to
give
a
sum
of
money
to
some
frontin
male
or
female
to
act
and
think
for
him
madame
de
alone
could
carry
out
the
plan
imagined
by
the
baroness
nucingen
bitterly
regretted
having
quarreled
with
the
odious
old
however
feeling
confident
of
the
attractions
of
his
and
the
soothing
documents
signed
garat
he
rang
for
his
man
and
told
him
in
inquire
for
the
repulsive
widow
in
the
rue
and
desire
her
to
come
to
see
him
in
paris
extremes
are
made
to
meet
by
passion
vice
is
constantly
binding
the
rich
to
the
poor

mademoiselle

the
man
returned
within
two
hours
monsieur
le
baron
said
he
madame
de
is
ah
so
much
de
better
cried
the
baron
in
glee
i
shall
hafe
her
safe
the
good
woman
is
given
to
gambling
it
would
seem
the
valet
went
on
and
moreover
she
is
under
the
thumb
of
a
actor
in
a
suburban
theatre
whom
for
decency
s
sake
she
calls
her
godson
she
is
a
cook
it
would
seem
and
wants
a

of
geniuses
of
de
common
people
hafe
alvays
ten
vays
of
making
money
and
ein
dozen
vays
of
spending
it
said
the
baron
to
himself
quite
unconscious
that
panurge
had
thought
the
same
thing
he
sent
his
servant
off
in
quest
of
madame
de
who
did
not
come
till
the
next
day
being
questioned
by
asie
the
servant
revealed
to
this
female
spy
the
terrible
effects
of
the
notes
written
to
monsieur
le
baron
by
his
mistress
monsieur
must
be
desperately
in
love
with
the
woman
said
he
in
conclusion
for
he
was
very
near
dying
for
my
part
i
advised
him
never
to
go
back
to
her
for
he
will
be
wheedled
over
at
once
a
woman
who
has
already
cost
monsieur
le
baron
five
hundred
thousand
francs
they
say
without
counting
what
he
has
spent
on
the
house
in
the
rue
but
the
woman
cares
for
money
and
for
money
as
madame
came
out
of
monsieur
s
room
she
said
with
a
laugh
if
this
goes
on
that
slut
will
make
a
widow
of
me
the
devil
cried
asie
it
will
never
do
to
kill
the
goose
that
lays
the
golden
monsieur
le
baron
has
no
hope
now
but
in
you
said
the
valet
ay
the
fact
is
i
do
know
how
to
make
a
woman
well
walk
in
said
the
man
bowing
to
such
occult
powers
well
said
the
false
going
into
the
sufferer
s
room
with
an
abject
air
monsieur
le
baron
has
met
with
some
difficulties
what
can
you
expect
everybody
is
open
to
attack
on
his
weak
side
dear
me
i
have
had
my
troubles
too
within
two
months
the
wheel
of
fortune
has
turned
upside
down
for
me
here
i
am
looking
out
for
a
place
we
have
neither
of
us
been
very
wise
if
monsieur
le
baron
would
take
me
as
cook
to
madame
esther
i
would
be
the
most
devoted
of
slaves
i
should
be
useful
to
you
monsieur
to
keep
an
eye
on
eugenie
and
dere

no
hope
of
dat
said
the
baron
i
can
not
succeet
in
being
de

i
am
let

a
tance
as
as

and
the
little
slut
has
got
you
and

making
a
fool
of
heaven

just
just
said
the
baron
i
hafe
not
sent
for
you
to
preach
to
me
pooh
my
boy
a
little
moralizing
breaks
no
bones
it
is
the
salt
of
life
to
the
like
of
us
as
vice
is
to
your
come
have
you
been
generous
you
have
paid
her
debts
ja
said
the
baron
lamentably
that
is
well
and
you
have
taken
her
things
out
of
pawn
and
that
is
better
but
you
must
see
that
it
is
not
enough
all
this
gives
her
no
occupation
and
these
creatures
love
to
cut
a
dash
i
shall
hafe
a
surprise
for
her
rue
she

the
baron
but

cried
the
baron
and

my

replied
asie

me
we
have
fleeced
the
public
of
some
millions
my
little
friend
millions
i
am
told
you
the
baron
could
not
suppress
a
smile
well
you
must
let

i
shall
let
one
go
but
as
soon
as
i
shall
let

go
i
shall
hafe

replied
asie
you
will
not
say
b
for
fear
of
having
to
go
on
to
z
still
esther
is
a
good
girl
a
ver
honest
girl
cried
the
banker
an
she
is
ready
to
submit
but
only
as
in
payment
of
a
in
short
she
does
not
want
to
be
your
mistress
she
feels
an
well
and
i
understand
it
the
child
has
always
done
just
what
she
pleased
when
a
girl
has
never
known
any
but
charming
young
men
she
can
not
take
to
an
old
one
you
are
not
handsome
you
are
as
big
as
louis
and
rather
dull
company
as
all
men
are
who
try
to
cajole
fortune
instead
of
devoting
themselves
to
well
if
you
don
t
think
six
hundred
thousand
francs
too
much
said
asie
i
pledge
myself
to
make
her

you
can

cried
the
baron
with
a
start
esther
is
to
cost
me
a
million
to
begin
with
happiness
is
surely
worth
sixteen
hundred
thousand
francs
you
old
sinner
you
must
know
men
in
these
days
have
certainly
spent
more
than
one
or
two
millions
on
a
mistress
i
even
know
women
who
have
cost
men
their
lives
for
whom
heads
have
rolled
into
the
you
know
the
doctor
who
poisoned
his
friend
he
wanted
the

moment

a
little
when

i
am
about

terms

course

must
first
order
her
a
lovely
dress
from
madame
auguste
who
knows
her
style
and
taste
and
order
the
new
carriage
to
be

clock
after
the
bourse
closes
go
to
her
rooms
and

for
a
little
drive
in

bois

boulogne

by
that
act
the
woman
proclaims
herself
your
mistress

has
advertised

and
knowledge
of
all
paris
a
hundred
thousand

dine
with

i
know
how
to

a
dinner
you
must
take
her
to
the
play

the
varietes
to
a
and
then
all
paris
will
say
there
is
that
old
rascal
nucingen
with
his
it
is
very
flattering
to
know
that
such
things
are
well
all
this
for
i
am
not
grasping
is
included
for
the
first
hundred
thousand
in
a
week
by
such
conduct
you
will
have
made
some
way
but
i
shall
hafe
paid
ein
hundert
tousant
in
the
course
of
the
second
week
asie
went
on
as
though
she
had
not
heard
this
lamentable
ejaculation
madame
tempted
by
these
preliminaries
will
have
made
up
her
mind
to
leave
her
little
apartment
and
move
to
the
house
you
are
giving
her
your
esther
will
have
seen
the
world
again
have
found
her
old
friends
she
will
wish
to
shine
and
do
the
honors
of
her
palace
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things
another
hundred
thousand
francs
by
heaven
you
are
at
home
there
esther
compromised
she
must
be
yours
the
rest
is
a
mere
trifle
in
which
you
must
play
the
principal
part
old
elephant
how
wide
the
monster
opens
his
eyes
well
i
will
undertake
that
too
four
hundred
thousand
and
that
my
fine
fellow
you
need
not
pay
till
the
day
after
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
honesty
i
have
more
confidence
in
you
than
you
have
in
me
if
i
persuade
madame
to
show
herself
as
your
mistress
to
compromise
herself
to
take
every
gift
you
offer
her
perhaps
this
very
day
you
will
believe
that
i
am
capable
of
inducing
her
to
throw
open
the
pass
of
the
great
saint
bernard
and
it
is
a
hard
job
i
can
tell
you
it
will
take
as
much
pulling
to
get
your
artillery
through
as
it
took
the
first
consul
to
get
over
the
but
vy
her
heart
is
full
of
love
old
shaver
rasibus
as
you
say
who
know
latin
replied
asie
she
thinks
herself
the
queen
of
sheba
because
she
has
washed
herself
in
sacrifices
made
for
her
lover
an
idea
that
that
sort
of
woman
gets
into
her
head
well
well
old
fellow
we
must
be
it
is
fine
that
baggage
would
die
of
grief
at
being
your
mistress
i
really
should
not
wonder
but
what
i
trust
to
and
i
tell
you
to
give
you
courage
is
that
there
is
good
in
the
girl
at
you
hafe
a
genius
for
corruption
said
the
baron
who
had
listened
to
asie
in
admiring
silence
just
as
i
hafe
de
knack
of
de
then
it
is
settled
my
pigeon

will
set

work
said
asie
and
you
may
come
monsieur
she
added
respectfully
you
will
find
madame
as
soft
already
as
a
cat
s
back
and
perhaps
inclined
to
make
herself
go
go
my
goot
voman
said
the
banker
rubbing
his
hands
and
after
seeing
the
horrible
mulatto
out
of
the
house
he
said
to
himself
how
vise
it
is
to
hafe
much
he
sprang
out
of
bed
went
down
to
his
office
and
resumed
the
conduct
of
his
immense
business
with
a
light
heart
nothing
could
be
more
fatal
to
esther
than
the
steps
taken
by
nucingen
the
hapless
girl
in
defending
her
fidelity
was
defending
her
life
this
very
natural
instinct
was
what
carlos
called
prudery
now
asie
not
without
taking
such
precautions
as
usual
in
such
cases
went
off
to
report
to
carlos
the
conference
she
had
held
with
the
baron
and
all
the
profit
she
had
made
by
it
the
man
s
rage
like
himself
was
terrible
he
came
forthwith
to
esther
in
a
carriage
with
the
blinds
drawn
driving
into
the
courtyard
still
almost
white
with
fury
the
forger
went
straight
into
the
poor
girl
s
room
she
looked
at
him
she
was
standing
up
and
she
dropped
on
to
a
chair
as
though
her
legs
had
snapped
what
is
the
matter
monsieur
said
she
quaking
in
every
limb
leave
us
europe
said
he
to
the
maid
esther
looked
at
the
woman
as
a
child
might
look
at
its
mother
from
whom
some
assassin
had
snatched
it
to
murder
it
do
you
know
where
you
will
send
lucien
carlos
went
on
when
he
was
alone
with
esther
where
asked
she
in
a
low
voice
venturing
to
glance
at
her
executioner
where
i
come
from
my
esther
as
she
looked
at
the
man
saw
red
to
the
hulks
he
added
in
an
undertone
esther
shut
her
eyes
and
stretched
herself
out
her
arms
dropped
and
she
turned
white
the
man
rang
and
prudence
appeared
bring
her
round
he
said
coldly
i
have
not
he
walked
up
and
down
the
while
waiting
was
obliged
to
come
and
beg
monsieur
to
lift
esther
on
to
the
bed
he
carried
her
with
the
ease
that
betrayed
athletic
strength
they
had
to
procure
all
the
chemist
s
strongest
stimulants
to
restore
esther
to
a
sense
of
her
woes
an
hour
later
the
poor
girl
was
able
to
listen
to
this
living
nightmare
seated
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
his
eyes
fixed
and
glowing
like
two
spots
of
molten
lead
my
little
sweetheart
said
he
lucien
now
stands
between
a
splendid
life
honored
happy
and
respected
and
the
hole
full
of
water
mud
and
gravel
into
which
he
was
going
to
plunge
when
i
met
him
the
house
of
grandlieu
requires
of
the
dear
boy
an
estate
worth
a
million
francs
before
securing
for
him
the
title
of
marquis
and
handing
over
to
him
that
named
clotilde
by
whose
help
he
will
rise
to
power
thanks
to
you
and
me
lucien
has
just
purchased
his
maternal
manor
the
old
chateau
de
rubempre
which
indeed
did
not
cost
much
thirty
thousand
francs
but
his
lawyer
by
clever
negotiations
has
succeeded
in
adding
to
it
estates
worth
a
million
on
which
three
hundred
thousand
francs
are
paid
the
chateau
the
expenses
and
percentages
to
the
men
who
were
put
forward
as
a
blind
to
conceal
the
transaction
from
the
country
people
have
swallowed
up
the
remainder
we
have
to
be
sure
a
hundred
thousand
francs
invested
in
a
business
here
which
a
few
months
hence
will
be
worth
two
to
three
hundred
thousand
francs
but
there
will
still
be
four
hundred
thousand
francs
to
be
paid
in
three
days
lucien
will
be
home
from
angouleme
where
he
has
been
because
he
must
not
be
suspected
of
having
found
a
fortune
in
remaking
your
bed
oh
no
cried
she
looking
up
with
a
noble
impulse
i
ask
you
then
is
this
a
moment
to
scare
off
the
baron
he
went
on
calmly
and
you
very
nearly
killed
him
the
day
before
yesterday
he
fainted
like
a
woman
on
reading
your
second
letter
you
have
a
fine
style
i
congratulate
you
if
the
baron
had
died
where
should
we
be
now
when
lucien
walks
out
of
d
aquin
to
the
duc
de
grandlieu
if
you
want
to
try
a
dip
in
the
seine
well
my
beauty
i
offer
you
my
hand
for
a
dive
together
it
is
one
way
of
ending
matters
but
consider
a
moment
would
it
not
be
better
to
live
and
say
to
yourself
again
and
again
this
fine
fortune
this
happy
family
for
he
will
have
children
children
have
you
ever
thought
of
the
joy
of
running
your
fingers
through
the
hair
of
his
children
esther
closed
her
eyes
with
a
little
shiver
well
as
you
gaze
on
that
structure
of
happiness
you
may
say
to
yourself
this
is
my
doing
there
was
a
pause
and
the
two
looked
at
each
other
this
is
what
i
have
tried
to
make
out
of
such
despair
as
saw
no
issue
but
the
river
said
carlos
am
i
selfish
that
is
the
way
to
love
men
show
such
devotion
to
none
but
kings
but
i
have
anointed
lucien
king
if
i
were
riveted
for
the
rest
of
my
days
to
my
old
chain
i
fancy
i
could
stay
there
resigned
so
long
as
i
could
say
he
is
gay
he
is
at
my
soul
and
mind
would
triumph
while
my
carcase
was
given
over
to
the
jailers
you
are
a
mere
female
you
love
like
a
female
but
in
a
courtesan
as
in
all
degraded
creatures
love
should
be
a
means
to
motherhood
in
spite
of
nature
which
has
stricken
you
with
barrenness
if
ever
under
the
skin
of
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
any
one
were
to
detect
the
convict
i
have
been
do
you
know
what
i
would
do
to
avoid
compromising
lucien
esther
awaited
the
reply
with
some
anxiety
well
he
said
after
a
brief
pause
i
would
die
as
the
negroes
do
without
a
word
and
you
with
all
your
airs
will
put
folks
on
my
traces
what
did
i
require
of
you
to
be
la
torpille
again
for
six
months
for
six
weeks
and
to
do
it
to
clutch
a
million
lucien
will
never
forget
you
men
do
not
forget
the
being
of
whom
they
are
reminded
day
after
day
by
the
joy
of
awaking
rich
every
morning
lucien
is
a
better
fellow
than
you
are
he
began
by
loving
coralie
she
died
good
but
he
had
not
enough
money
to
bury
her
he
did
not
do
as
you
did
just
now
he
did
not
faint
though
he
is
a
poet
he
wrote
six
rollicking
songs
and
earned
three
hundred
francs
with
which
he
paid
for
coralie
s
funeral
i
have
those
songs
i
know
them
by
heart
well
then
do
you
too
compose
your
songs
be
cheerful
be
wild
be
irresistible
and
insatiable
you
hear
me
do
not
let
me
have
to
speak
again
kiss
papa
when
half
an
hour
after
europe
went
into
her
mistress
room
she
found
her
kneeling
in
front
of
a
crucifix
in
the
attitude
which
the
most
religious
of
painters
has
given
to
moses
before
the
burning
bush
on
horeb
to
depict
his
deep
and
complete
adoration
of
jehovah
after
saying
her
prayers
esther
had
renounced
her
better
life
the
honor
she
had
created
for
herself
her
glory
her
virtue
and
her
love
she
rose
oh
madame
you
will
never
look
like
that
again
cried
prudence
servien
struck
by
her
mistress
sublime
beauty
she
hastily
turned
the
long
mirror
so
that
the
poor
girl
should
see
herself
her
eyes
still
had
a
light
as
of
the
soul
flying
heavenward
the
jewess
complexion
was
brilliant
sparkling
with
tears
unshed
in
the
fervor
of
prayer
her
eyelashes
were
like
leaves
after
a
summer
shower
for
the
last
time
they
shone
with
the
sunshine
of
pure
love
her
lips
seemed
to
preserve
an
expression
as
of
her
last
appeal
to
the
angels
whose
palm
of
martyrdom
she
had
no
doubt
borrowed
while
placing
in
their
hands
her
past
unspotted
life
and
she
had
the
majesty
which
mary
stuart
must
have
shown
at
the
moment
when
she
bid
adieu
to
her
crown
to
earth
and
to
love
i
wish
lucien
could
have
seen
me
thus
she
said
with
a
smothered
sigh
now
she
added
in
a
strident
tone
now
for
a
fling
europe
stood
dumb
at
hearing
the
words
as
though
she
had
heard
an
angel
blaspheme
well
why
need
you
stare
at
me
to
see
if
i
have
cloves
in
my
mouth
instead
of
teeth
i
am
nothing
henceforth
but
a
vile
foul
creature
a
thief
and
i
expect
milord
so
get
me
a
hot
bath
and
put
my
dress
out
it
is
twelve
o
clock
the
baron
will
look
in
no
doubt
when
the
bourse
closes
i
shall
tell
him
i
was
waiting
for
him
and
asie
is
to
prepare
us
dinner
mind
you
i
mean
to
turn
the
man
s
come
hurry
hurry
my
girl
we
are
going
to
have
some
fun
that
is
to
say
we
must
go
to
she
sat
down
at
the
table
and
wrote
the
following
note
my
friend
if
the
cook
you
have
sent
me
had
not
already
been
in
my
service
i
might
have
thought
that
your
purpose
was
to
let
me
know
how
often
you
had
fainted
yesterday
on
receiving
my
three
notes
what
can
i
say
i
was
very
nervous
that
day
i
was
thinking
over
the
memories
of
my
miserable
existence
but
i
know
how
sincere
asie
is
still
i
can
not
repent
of
having
caused
you
so
much
pain
since
it
has
availed
to
prove
to
me
how
much
you
love
me
this
is
how
we
are
made
we
luckless
and
despised
creatures
true
affection
touches
us
far
more
deeply
than
finding
ourselves
the
objects
of
lavish
liberality
for
my
part
i
have
always
rather
dreaded
being
a
peg
on
which
you
would
hang
your
vanities
it
annoyed
me
to
be
nothing
else
to
you
yes
in
spite
of
all
your
protestations
i
fancied
you
regarded
me
merely
as
a
woman
paid
for
well
you
will
now
find
me
a
good
girl
but
on
condition
of
your
always
obeying
me
a
little
if
this
letter
can
in
any
way
take
the
place
of
the
doctor
s
prescription
prove
it
by
coming
to
see
me
after
the
bourse
closes
you
will
find
me
in
full
fig
dressed
in
your
gifts
for
i
am
for
life
your
at
the
bourse
the
baron
de
nucingen
was
so
gay
so
cheerful
seemed
so
and
allowed
himself
so
many
jests
that
du
tillet
and
the
kellers
who
were
on
change
could
not
help
asking
him
the
reason
of
his
high
spirits
i
am
belofed
ve
shall
soon
gife
dat
he
told
du
tillet
and
how
much
does
it
cost
you
asked
francois
keller
rudely
it
was
said
that
he
had
spent
thousand
francs
a
year
on
madame
colleville
dat
voman
is
an
anchel
she
never
has
ask
me
for
one
they
never
do
replied
du
tillet
and
it
is
to
avoid
asking
that
they
have
always
aunts
or
between
the
bourse
and
the
rue
taitbout
seven
times
did
the
baron
say
to
his
servant
you
go
so
slow
vip
de
horse
he
ran
lightly
upstairs
and
for
the
first
time
he
saw
his
mistress
in
all
the
beauty
of
such
women
who
have
no
other
occupation
than
the
care
of
their
person
and
their
dress
just
out
of
her
bath
the
flower
was
quite
fresh
and
perfumed

as
to
inspire
desire

esther

in
a
charming
toilette
a
dress
of
black
corded
silk
trimmed
with

over
a
petticoat
of
gray
satin
the

subsequently
worn
by
amigo
the
handsome
singer
in
a
honiton
lace
kerchief
fell
or
floated
over
her
shoulders
the
sleeves
of
her
gown
were
strapped
round
with
cording
to
divide
the
puffs
which
for
some
little
time
fashion
has
substituted
for
the
large
sleeves
which
had
grown
too
monstrous
esther
had
fastened
a
mechlin
lace
cap
on
her
magnificent
hair
with
a
pin
la
as
it
is
called
ready
to
fall
but
not
really
falling
giving
her
an
appearance
of
being
tumbled
and
in
disorder
though
the
white
parting
showed
plainly
on
her
little
head
between
the
waves
of
her
hair
is
it
not
a
shame
to
see
madame

make
your

and
above
all
she
added
in
his
ear
bring
her
the
most
beautiful
bouquet
to
be
had
in
paris
it
is
winter
so
try
to
get
tropical
the
baron
went
downstairs
and
told
his
servants
to
go
to

the
coachman
drove
to
a
famous
pastrycook

she
is
a

you
damn
idiot
and
not

cried
the
baron
who
rushed
off
to
madame
prevot
s
in
the
where
he
had
a
bouquet
made
up
for
the
price
of
ten
louis
while
his
man
went
to
the
great
modiste
a
superficial
observer
walking
about
paris
wonders
who
the
fools
can
be
that
buy
the
fabulous
flowers
that
grace
the
illustrious
bouquetiere
s
shop
window
and
the
choice
products
displayed
by

of
european
fame
the
only
purveyor
who
can
vie
with
the

a
real
and
delicious

every
day
in

a
hundred
or
more
passions
a
la
nucingen
come
into
being
and
find
expression
in
offering
such
rarities
as
queens
dare
not
purchase
presented
kneeling
to
baggages
who
to
use
asie
s
word
like
to
cut
a
dash
but
for
these
little
details
a
decent
citizen
would
be
puzzled
to
conceive
how
a
fortune
melts
in
the
hands
of
these
women
whose
social
function
in
fourier
s
scheme
is
perhaps
to
rectify
the
disasters
caused
by
avarice
and
cupidity
such
squandering
is
no
doubt
to
the
social
body
what
a
prick
of
the
lancet
is
to
a
plethoric
subject
in
two
months
nucingen
had
shed
broadcast
on
trade
more
than
two
hundred
thousand
francs
by
the
time
the
old
lover
returned
darkness
was
falling
the
bouquet
was
no
longer
of
any
use
the
hour
for
driving
in
the
in
winter
is
between
two
and
four
however
the
carriage
was
of
use
to
convey
esther
from
the
rue
taitbout
to
the
rue
where
she
took
possession
of
the
little
never
before
had
esther
been
the
object
of
such
worship
or
such
lavishness
and
it
amazed
her
but
like
all
royal
ingrates
she
took
care
to
express
no
surprise
when
you
go
into
peter
s
at
rome
to
enable
you
to
appreciate
the
extent
and
height
of
this
queen
of
cathedrals
you
are
shown
the
little
finger
of
a
statue
which
looks
of
a
natural
size
and
which
measures
i
know
not
how
much
descriptions
have
been
so
severely
criticised
necessary
as
they
are
to
a
history
of
manners
that
i
must
here
follow
the
example
of
the
roman
cicerone
as
they
entered
the
the
baron
could
not
resist
asking
esther
to
feel
the
stuff
of
which
the
window
curtains
were
made
draped
with
magnificent
fulness
lined
with
white
watered
silk
and
bordered
with
a
gimp
fit
to
trim
a
portuguese
princess
bodice
the
material
was
silk
brought
from
canton
on
which
chinese
patience
had
painted
oriental
birds
with
a
perfection
only
to
be
seen
in
mediaeval
illuminations
or
in
the
missal
of
charles
the
pride
of
the
imperial
library
at
vienna
it
hafe
cost
two
tousand
franc
an
ell
for
a
milord
who
brought
it
from
intia
it
is
very
nice
charming
said
esther
how
i
shall
enjoy
drinking
champagne
here
the
froth
will
not
get
dirty
here
on
a
bare
oh
madame
cried
europe
only
look
at
the
carpet
dis
carpet
hafe
been
made
for
de
duc
de
torlonia
a
frient
of
mine
who
fount
it
too
dear
so
i
took
it
for
you
who
are
my
qveen
said
nucingen
by
chance
this
carpet
by
one
of
our
cleverest
designers
matched
with
the
whimsicalities
of
the
chinese
curtains
the
walls
painted
by
schinner
and
leon
de
lora
represented
voluptuous
scenes
in
carved
ebony
frames
purchased
for
their
weight
in
gold
from
dusommerard
and
forming
panels
with
a
narrow
line
of
gold
that
coyly
caught
the
light
from
this
you
may
judge
of
the
rest
you
did
well
to
bring
me
here
said
esther
it
will
take
me
a
week
to
get
used
to
my
home
and
not
to
look
like
a
parvenu
in
it
home
den
you
shall
accept
it
cried
the
baron
in
glee
why
of
course
and
a
thousand
times
of
course
stupid
animal
said
she
smiling
animal
vas
enough
stupid
is
a
term
of
endearment
said
she
looking
at
him
the
poor
man
took
esther
s
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
heart
he
was
animal
enough
to
feel
but
too
stupid
to
find
words
feel
how
it
beats
for
ein
little
tender
vort
and
he
conducted
his
goddess
to
her
room
oh
madame
i
can
not
stay
here
cried
eugenie
it
makes
me
long
to
go
to
well
said
esther
i
mean
to
please
the
magician
who
has
worked
all
these
listen
my
fat
elephant
after
dinner
we
will
go
to
the
play
together
i
am
starving
to
see
a
it
was
just
five
years
since
esther
had
been
to
a
theatre
all
paris
was
rushing
at
that
time
to
the
to
see
one
of
those
pieces
to
which
the
power
of
the
actors
lends
a
terrible
expression
of
reality
like
all
ingenuous
natures
esther
loved
to
feel
the
thrills
of
fear
as
much
as
to
yield
to
tears
of
pathos
let
us
go
to
see
frederick
lemaitre
said
she
he
is
an
actor
i
it
is
a
horrible
piece
said
nucingen
foreseeing
the
moment
when
he
must
show
himself
in
public
he
sent
his
servant
to
secure
one
of
the
two
on
the
grand
and
this
is
another
strange
feature
of
paris
whenever
success
on
feet
of
clay
fills
a
house
there
is
always
a
to
be
had
ten
minutes
before
the
curtain
rises
the
managers
keep
it
for
themselves
unless
it
happens
to
be
taken
for
a
passion
a
la
nucingen
this
box
like
chevet
s
dainties
is
a
tax
levied
on
the
whims
of
the
parisian
olympus
it
would
be
superfluous
to
describe
the
plate
and
china
nucingen
had
provided
three
services
of
plate
common
medium
and
best
and
the
best
plates
dishes
and
all
was
of
chased
silver
gilt
the
banker
to
avoid
overloading
the
table
with
gold
and
silver
had
completed
the
array
of
each
service
with
porcelain
of
exquisite
fragility
in
the
style
of
dresden
china
which
had
cost
more
than
the
plate
as
to
the
linen
saxony
england
flanders
and
france
vied
in
the
perfection
of
flowered
damask
at
dinner
it
was
the
baron
s
turn
to
be
amazed
on
tasting
asie
s
cookery
i
understant
said
he
vy
you
call
her
asie
dis
is
asiatic
i
begin
to
think
he
loves
me
said
esther
to
europe
he
has
said
something
almost
like
a
i
said
many
vorts
said
he
well
he
is
more
like
turcaret
than
i
had
heard
he
was
cried
the
girl
laughing
at
this
reply
worthy
of
the
many
artless
speeches
for
which
the
banker
was
famous
the
dishes
were
so
highly
spiced
as
to
give
the
baron
an
indigestion
on
purpose
that
he
might
go
home
early
so
this
was
all
he
got
in
the
way
of
pleasure
out
of
his
first
evening
with
esther
at
the
theatre
he
was
obliged
to
drink
an
immense
number
of
glasses
of
eau
sucree
leaving
esther
alone
between
the
acts
by
a
coincidence
so
probable
that
it
can
scarcely
be
called
chance
tullia
mariette
and
madame
du
were
at
the
play
that
evening
enjoyed
a
wild
success
and
a
deserved
success
such
as
is
seen
only
in
paris
the
men
who
saw
this
play
all
came
to
the
conclusion
that
a
lawful
wife
might
be
thrown
out
of
window
and
the
wives
loved
to
see
themselves
unjustly
persecuted
the
women
said
to
each
other
this
is
too
much
we
are
driven
to
it
but
it
often
happens
now
a
woman
as
beautiful
as
esther
and
dressed
as
esther
was
could
not
show
off
with
impunity
in
a
at
the
and
so
during
the
second
act
there
was
quite
a
commotion
in
the
box
where
the
two
dancers
were
sitting
caused
by
the
undoubted
identity
of
the
unknown
fair
one
with
la
torpille
heyday
where
has
she
dropped
from
said
mariette
to
madame
du
i
thought
she
was
but
is
it
she
she
looks
to
me
times
younger
and
handsomer
than
she
was
six
years
perhaps
she
has
preserved
herself
in
ice
like
madame
d
espard
and
madame
zayonchek
said
the
comte
de
brambourg
who
had
brought
the
three
women
to
the
play
to
a
box
isn
t
she
the
rat
you
meant
to
send
me
to
hocus
my
uncle
said
he
addressing
tullia
the
very
same
said
the
singer
du
bruel
go
down
to
the
stalls
and
see
if
it
is
what
brass
she
has
got
exclaimed
madame
du
using
an
expressive
but
vulgar
phrase
oh
said
the
comte
de
brambourg
she
very
well
may
she
is
with
my
friend
the
baron
de
nucingen
i
will
go
is
that
the
immaculate
joan
of
arc
who
has
taken
nucingen
by
storm
and
who
has
been
talked
of
till
we
are
all
sick
of
her
these
three
months
past
asked
mariette
my
dear
baron
said
philippe
bridau
as
he
went
into
nucingen
s
box
so
here
you
are
married
to
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
i
am
an
old
officer
whom
you
once
on
a
time
were
to
have
got
out
of
a
scrape
at
issoudun
philippe
bridau
i
know
nothing
of
it
said
esther
looking
round
the
house
through
her
dis
lady
said
the
baron
is
no
longer
known
as
esther
so
short
she
is
called
montame
de
champy
ein
little
estate
vat
i
have
bought
for
her
though
you
do
things
in
such
style
said
the
comte
these
ladies
are
saying
that
madame
de
champy
gives
herself
too
great
if
you
do
not
choose
to
remember
me
will
you
condescend
to
recognize
mariette
tullia
madame
du
the
parvenu
went
on
a
man
for
whom
the
duc
de
maufrigneuse
had
won
the
dauphin
s
favor
if
these
ladies
are
kind
to
me
i
am
willing
to
make
myself
pleasant
to
them
replied
madame
de
champy
drily
kind
why
they
are
excellent
they
have
named
you
joan
of
arc
replied
philippe
vell
den
if
dese
ladies
vill
keep
you
company
said
nucingen
i
shall
go
vay
for
i
hafe
eaten
too
much
your
carriage
shall
come
for
you
and
your
dat
teufel
asie
the
first
time
and
you
leave
me
alone
said
esther
come
come
you
must
have
courage
enough
to
die
on
deck
i
must
have
my
man
with
me
as
i
go
out
if
i
were
insulted
am
i
to
cry
out
for
nothing
the
old
millionaire
s
selfishness
had
to
give
way
to
his
duties
as
a
lover
the
baron
suffered
but
stayed
esther
had
her
own
reasons
for
detaining
her
if
she
admitted
her
acquaintance
she
would
be
less
closely
questioned
in
his
presence
than
if
she
were
alone
philippe
bridau
hurried
back
to
the
box
where
the
dancers
were
sitting
and
informed
them
of
the
state
of
affairs
oh
so
it
is
she
who
has
fallen
heir
to
my
house
in
the
rue
observed
madame
du
with
some
bitterness
for
she
as
she
phrased
it
was
on
the
loose
most
likely
said
the
colonel
du
tillet
told
me
that
the
baron
had
spent
three
times
as
much
there
as
your
poor
let
us
go
round
to
her
box
said
tullia
not
if
i
know
it
said
mariette
she
is
much
too
handsome
i
will
call
on
her
at
i
think
myself
enough
to
risk
it
remarked
tullia
so
the
leading
dancer
went
round
between
the
acts
and
renewed
acquaintance
with
esther
who
would
talk
only
on
general
subjects
and
where
have
you
come
back
from
my
dear
child
asked
tullia
who
could
not
restrain
her
curiosity
oh
i
was
for
five
years
in
a
castle
in
the
alps
with
an
englishman
as
jealous
as
a
tiger
a
nabob
i
called
him
a
nabot
a
dwarf
for
he
was
not
so
big
as
le
bailli
de
ferrette
and
then
i
came
across
a
banker
from
a
savage
to
salvation
as
florine
might
say
and
now
here
i
am
in
paris
again
i
long
so
for
amusement
that
i
mean
to
have
a
rare
time
i
shall
keep
open
house
i
have
five
years
of
solitary
confinement
to
make
good
and
i
am
beginning
to
do
it
five
years
of
an
englishman
is
rather
too
much
six
weeks
are
the
allowance
according
to
the
was
it
the
baron
who
gave
you
that
lace
no
it
is
a
relic
of
the
what
i
have
my
dear
he
was
as
yellow
as
a
friend
s
smile
at
a
success
i
thought
he
would
be
dead
in
ten
months
pooh
he
was
a
strong
as
a
mountain
always
distrust
men
who
say
they
have
a
liver
complaint
i
will
never
listen
to
a
man
who
talks
of
his
i
have
had
too
much
of
livers
who
can
not
die
my
nabob
robbed
me
he
died
without
making
a
will
and
the
family
turned
me
out
of
doors
like
a
so
then
i
said
to
my
fat
friend
here
pay
for
two
you
may
as
well
call
me
joan
of
arc
i
have
ruined
england
and
perhaps
i
shall
die
at
the
stake
of
love
said
tullia
and
burnt
alive
answered
esther
and
the
question
made
her
thoughtful
the
baron
laughed
at
all
this
vulgar
nonsense
but
he
did
not
always
follow
it
readily
so
that
his
laughter
sounded
like
the
forgotten
crackers
that
go
off
after
fireworks
we
all
live
in
a
sphere
of
some
kind

the
inhabitants
of
every

are
endowed
with
an
equal

next
evening
at
the
opera
esther
s
reappearance
was
the
great
news
behind
the
scenes
between
two
and
four
in
the
afternoon
all

in

recognized

and
knew
at
last
who
was
the
object
of
the
baron

passion
do
you
know
blondet
remarked
to
de
marsay
in
the
greenroom
at
the
that
la
torpille
vanished
the
very
day
after
the
evening
when
we
saw
her
here
and
recognized
her
in
little
rubempre
s
in
paris
as
in
the
provinces
everything
is
known
the
police
of
the
rue
de
jerusalem
are
not
so
efficient
as
the
world
itself
for
every
one
is
a
spy
on
every
one
else
though
unconsciously
carlos
had
fully
understood
the
danger
of
lucien
s
position
during
and
after
the
episode
of
the
rue
taitbout
no
position
can
be
more
dreadful
than
that
in
which
madame
du
now
found
herself
and
the
phrase
to
be
on
the
loose
or
as
the
french
say
left
on
foot
expresses
it
perfectly
the
recklessness
and
extravagance
of
these
women
precludes
all
care
for
the
future
in
that
strange
world
far
more
witty
and
amusing
than
might
be
supposed
only
such
women
as
are
not
gifted
with
that
perfect
beauty
which
time
can
hardly
impair
and
which
is
quite
unmistakable
only
such
women
in
short
as
can
be
loved
merely
as
a
fancy
ever
think
of
old
age
and
save
a
fortune
the
handsomer
they
are
the
more
improvident
they
are
are
you
afraid
of
growing
ugly
that
you
are
saving
money
was
a
speech
of
florine
s
to
mariette
which
may
give
a
clue
to
one
cause
of
this
thriftlessness
thus
if
a
speculator
kills
himself
or
a
spendthrift
comes
to
the
end
of
his
resources
these
women
fall
with
hideous
promptitude
from
audacious
wealth
to
the
utmost
misery
they
throw
themselves
into
the
clutches
of
the
buyer
and
sell
exquisite
jewels
for
a
mere
song
they
run
into
debt
expressly
to
keep
up
a
spurious
luxury
in
the
hope
of
recovering
what
they
have
lost
a
to
draw
upon
these
ups
and
downs
of
their
career
account
for
the
costliness
of
such
connections
generally
brought
about
as
asie
had
hooked
another
word
of
her
vocabulary
nucingen
for
esther
and
so
those
who
know
their
paris
are
quite
aware
of
the
state
of
affairs
when
in
the
that
bustling
and
mongrel
bazaar
they
meet
some
woman
in
a
hired
fly
whom
six
months
or
a
year
before
they
had
seen
in
a
magnificent
and
dazzling
carriage
turned
out
in
the
most
luxurious
style
if
you
fall
on
you
must
contrive
to
rebound
on
the
bois
de
boulogne
said
florine
laughing
with
blondet
over
the
little
vicomte
de
portenduere
some
clever
women
never
run
the
risk
of
this
contrast
they
bury
themselves
in
horrible
furnished
lodgings
where
they
expiate
their
extravagance
by
such
privations
as
are
endured
by
travelers
lost
in
a
sahara
but
they
never
take
the
smallest
fancy
for
economy
they
venture
forth
to
masked
balls
they
take
journeys
into
the
provinces
they
turn
out
well
dressed
on
the
boulevards
when
the
weather
is
fine
and
then
they
find
in
each
other
the
devoted
kindness
which
is
known
only
among
proscribed
races
it
costs
a
woman
in
luck
no
effort
to
bestow
some
help
for
she
says
to
herself
i
may
be
in
the
same
plight
by
sunday
however
the
most
efficient
protector
still
is
the
purchaser
of
dress
when
this
greedy
finds
herself
the
creditor
she
stirs
and
works
on
the
hearts
of
all
the
old
men
she
knows
in
favor
of
the
mortgaged
creature
in
thin
boots
and
a
fine
bonnet
in
this
way
madame
du
unable
to
foresee
the
downfall
of
one
of
the
richest
and
cleverest
of
stockbrokers
was
left
quite
unprepared
she
had
spent
falleix
s
money
on
her
whims
and
trusted
to
him
for
all
necessaries
and
to
provide
for
the
future
how
could
i
have
expected
such
a
thing
in
a
man
who
seemed
such
a
good
fellow
in
almost
every
class
of
society
the
good
fellow
is
an
man
who
will
lend
a
few
crowns
now
and
again
without
expecting
them
back
who
always
behaves
in
accordance
with
a
certain
code
of
delicate
feeling
above
mere
vulgar
obligatory
and
commonplace
morality
certain
men
regarded
as
virtuous
and
honest
have
like
nucingen
ruined
their
benefactors
and
certain
others
who
have
been
through
a
criminal
court
have
an
ingenious
kind
of
honesty
towards
women
perfect
virtue
the
dream
of
moliere
an
alceste
is
exceedingly
rare
still
it
is
to
be
found
everywhere
even
in
paris
the
good
fellow
is
the
product
of
a
certain
facility
of
nature
which
proves
nothing
a
man
is
a
good
fellow
as
a
cat
is
silky
as
a
slipper
is
made
to
slip
on
to
the
foot
and
so
in
the
meaning
given
to
the
word
by
a
kept
woman
falleix
ought
to
have
warned
his
mistress
of
his
approaching
bankruptcy
and
have
given
her
enough
to
live
upon
d
estourny
the
dashing
swindler
was
a
good
fellow
he
cheated
at
cards
but
he
had
set
aside
thirty
thousand
francs
for
his
mistress
and
at
carnival
suppers
women
would
retort
on
his
accusers
no
matter
you
may
say
what
you
like
georges
was
a
good
fellow
he
had
charming
manners
he
deserved
a
better
these
girls
laugh
laws
to
scorn
and
adore
a
certain
kind
of
generosity
they
sell
themselves
as
esther
had
done
for
a
secret
ideal
which
is
their
religion
after
saving
a
few
jewels
from
the
wreck
with
great
difficulty
madame
du
was
crushed
under
the
burden
of
the
horrible
report
she
ruined
she
was
almost
thirty
and
though
she
was
in
the
prime
of
her
beauty
still
she
might
be
called
an
old
woman
and
all
the
more
so
because
in
such
a
crisis
all
a
woman
s
rivals
are
against
her
mariette
florine
tullia
would
ask
their
friend
to
dinner
and
gave
her
some
help
but
as
they
did
not
know
the
extent
of
her
debts
they
did
not
dare
to
sound
the
depths
of
that
gulf
an
interval
of
six
years
formed
rather
too
long
a
gap
in
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
paris
tide
between
la
torpille
and
madame
du
for
the
woman
on
foot
to
speak
to
the
woman
in
her
carriage
but
la
knew
that
esther
was
too
generous
not
to
remember
sometimes
that
she
had
as
she
said
fallen
heir
to
her
possessions
and
not
to
seek
her
out
by
some
meeting
which
might
seem
accidental
though
arranged
to
bring
about
such
an
accident
madame
du
dressed
in
the
most
way
walked
out
every
day
in
the
on
the
arm
of
theodore
gaillard
who
afterwards
married
her
and
who
in
these
straits
behaved
very
well
to
his
former
mistress
giving
her
boxes
at
the
play
and
inviting
her
to
every
spree
she
flattered
herself
that
esther
driving
out
one
fine
day
would
meet
her
face
to
face
esther
s
coachman
was
paccard
for
her
household
had
been
made
up
in
five
days
by
asie
europe
and
paccard
under
carlos
instructions
and
in
such
a
way
that
the
house
in
the
rue
was
an
impregnable
fortress
peyrade
on
his
part
prompted
by
deep
hatred
by
the
thirst
for
vengeance
and
above
all
by
his
wish
to
see
his
darling
lydie
married
made
the
the
end
of
his
walks
as
soon
as
he
heard
from
contenson
that
monsieur
de
nucingen
s
mistress
might
be
seen
there
peyrade
could
dress
so
exactly
like
an
englishman
and
spoke
french
so
perfectly
with
the
mincing
accent
that
the
english
give
the
language
he
knew
england
itself
so
well
and
was
so
familiar
with
all
the
customs
of
the
country
having
been
sent
to
england
by
the
police
authorities
three
times
between
and
that
he
could
play
his
part
in
london
and
at
ambassadors
residences
without
awaking
suspicion
peyrade
who
had
some
resemblance
to
musson
the
famous
juggler
could
disguise
himself
so
effectually
that
once
contenson
did
not
recognize
him
followed
by
contenson
dressed
as
a
mulatto
peyrade
examined
esther
and
her
servants
with
an
eye
which
seeming
heedless
took
everything
in
hence
it
quite
naturally
happened
that
in
the
side
alley
where
the
walk
in
fine
dry
weather
he
was
on
the
spot
one
day
when
esther
met
madame
du
peyrade
his
mulatto
in
livery
at
his
heels
was
airing
himself
quite
naturally
like
a
nabob
who
is
thinking
of
no
one
but
himself
in
a
line
with
the
two
women
so
as
to
catch
a
few
words
of
their
conversation
well
my
dear
child
said
esther
to
madame
du
come
and
see
me
nucingen
owes
it
to
himself
not
to
leave
his
stockbroker
s
mistress
without
a
sou
all
the
more
so
because
it
is
said
that
he
ruined
falleix
remarked
theodore
gaillard
and
that
we
have
every
right
to
squeeze
he
dines
with
me
said
esther
come
and
meet
then
she
added
in
an
undertone
i
can
do
what
i
like
with
him
and
as
yet
he
has
not
that
and
she
put
the
nail
of
a
gloved
finger
under
the
prettiest
of
her
teeth
with
the
click
that
is
familiarly
known
to
express
with
peculiar
energy
just
you
have
him
safe
my
dear
as
yet
he
has
only
paid
my
how
mean
cried
suzanne
du
oh
said
esther
i
had
debts
enough
to
frighten
a
minister
of
finance
now
i
mean
to
have
thirty
thousand
a
year
before
the
first
stroke
of
midnight
oh
he
is
excellent
i
have
nothing
to
complain
of
he
does
it
in
a
week
we
give
a
you
must
that
morning
he
is
to
make
me
a
present
of
the
lease
of
the
house
in
the
rue
in
decency
it
is
impossible
to
live
in
such
a
house
on
less
than
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
of
my
own
so
as
to
have
them
safe
in
case
of
accident
i
have
known
poverty
and
i
want
no
more
of
it
there
are
certain
acquaintances
one
has
had
enough
of
at
and
you
who
used
to
say
my
face
is
my
fortune
how
you
have
changed
exclaimed
suzanne
it
is
the
air
of
switzerland
you
grow
thrifty
look
here
go
there
yourself
my
dear
catch
a
swiss
and
you
may
perhaps
catch
a
husband
for
they
have
not
yet
learned
what
such
women
as
we
are
can
be
and
at
any
rate
you
may
come
back
with
a
passion
for
investments
in
the
funds
a
most
respectable
and
elegant
passion
esther
got
into
her
carriage
again
a
handsome
carriage
drawn
by
the
finest
pair
of
dappled
gray
horses
at
that
time
to
be
seen
in
paris
the
woman
who
is
getting
into
the
carriage
is
handsome
said
peyrade
to
contenson
but
i
like
the
one
who
is
walking
best
follow
her
and
find
out
who
she
that
is
what
that
englishman
has
just
remarked
in
english
said
theodore
gaillard
repeating
peyrade
s
remark
to
madame
du
before
making
this
speech
in
english
peyrade
had
uttered
a
word
or
two
in
that
language
which
had
made
theodore
look
up
in
a
way
that
convinced
him
that
the
journalist
understood
english
madame
du
very
slowly
made
her
way
home
to
very
decent
furnished
rooms
in
the
rue
glancing
round
now
and
then
to
see
if
the
mulatto
were
following
her
this
establishment
was
kept
by
a
certain
madame
gerard
whom
suzanne
had
obliged
in
the
days
of
her
splendor
and
who
showed
her
gratitude
by
giving
her
a
suitable
home
this
good
soul
an
honest
and
virtuous
citizen
even
pious
looked
on
the
courtesan
as
a
woman
of
a
superior
order
she
had
always
seen
her
in
the
midst
of
luxury
and
thought
of
her
as
a
fallen
queen
she
trusted
her
daughters
with
her
and
which
is
a
fact
more
natural
than
might
be
supposed
the
courtesan
was
as
scrupulously
careful
in
taking
them
to
the
play
as
their
mother
could
have
been
and
the
two
gerard
girls
loved
her
the
worthy
kind
keeper
was
like
those
sublime
priests
who
see
in
these
outlawed
women
only
a
creature
to
be
saved
and
loved
madame
du
respected
this
worth
and
often
as
she
chatted
with
the
good
woman
she
envied
her
while
bewailing
her
own
your
are
still
handsome
you
may
make
a
good
end
yet
madame
gerard
would
say
but
indeed
madame
du
was
only
relatively
impoverished
this
woman
s
wardrobe
so
extravagant
and
elegant
was
still
sufficiently
well
furnished
to
allow
of
her
appearing
on
occasion
as
on
that
evening
at
the
to
see
in
much
splendor
and
madame
gerard
would
most
pay
for
the
cabs
needed
by
the
lady
on
foot
to
go
out
to
dine
or
to
the
play
and
to
come
home
again
well
dear
madame
gerard
said
she
to
this
worthy
mother
my
luck
is
about
to
change
i
well
well
madame
so
much
the
better
but
be
prudent
do
not
run
into
debt
any
more
i
have
such
difficulty
in
getting
rid
of
the
people
who
are
hunting
for
oh
never
worry
yourself
about
those
hounds
they
have
all
made
no
end
of
money
out
of
here
are
some
tickets
for
the
varietes
for
your
girls
a
good
box
on
the
second
tier
if
any
one
should
ask
for
me
this
evening
before
i
come
in
show
them
up
all
the
same
adele
my
old
maid
will
be
here
i
will
send
her
madame
du
having
neither
mother
nor
aunt
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
her
maid
equally
on
foot
to
play
the
part
of
a
with
the
unknown
follower
whose
conquest
was
to
enable
her
to
rise
again
in
the
world
she
went
to
dine
with
theodore
gaillard
who
as
it
happened
had
a
spree
on
that
day
that
is
to
say
a
dinner
given
by
nathan
in
payment
of
a
bet
he
had
lost
one
of
those
orgies
when
a
man
says
to
his
guests
you
can
bring
a
it
was
not
without
strong
reasons
that
peyrade
had
made
up
his
mind
to
rush
in
person
on
to
the
field
of
this
intrigue
at
the
same
time
his
curiosity
like
corentin
s
was
so
keenly
excited
that
even
in
the
absence
of
reasons
he
would
have
tried
to
play
a
part
in
the
drama
at
this
moment
charles
s
policy
had
completed
its
last
evolution
after
confiding
the
helm
of
state
to
ministers
of
his
own
choosing
the
king
was
preparing
to
conquer
algiers
and
to
utilize
the
glory
that
should
accrue
as
a
passport
to
what
has
been
called
his
d
there
were
no
more
conspiracies
at
home
charles
believed
he
had
no
domestic
enemies
but
in
politics
as
at
sea
a
calm
may
be
deceptive
thus
corentin
had
lapsed
into
total
idleness
in
such
a
case
a
true
sportsman
to
keep
his
hand
in
for
lack
of
larks
kills
sparrows
domitian
we
know
for
lack
of
christians
killed
flies
contenson
having
witnessed
esther
s
arrest
had
with
the
keen
instinct
of
a
spy
fully
understood
the
upshot
of
the
business
the
rascal
as
we
have
seen
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
his
opinion
of
the
baron
de
nucingen
who
is
benefiting
by
making
the
banker
pay
so
dear
for
his
passion
was
the
first
question
the
allies
asked
each
other
recognizing
asie
as
a
leader
in
the
piece
contenson
hoped
to
find
out
the
author
through
her
but
she
slipped
through
his
fingers
again
and
again
hiding
like
an
eel
in
the
mud
of
paris
and
when
he
found
her
again
as
the
cook
in
esther
s
establishment
it
seemed
to
him
inexplicable
that
the
woman
should
have
had
a
finger
in
the
pie
thus
for
the
first
time
these
two
artistic
spies
had
come
on
a
text
that
they
could
not
decipher
while
suspecting
a
dark
plot
to
the
story
after
three
bold
attempts
on
the
house
in
the
rue
taitbout
contenson
still
met
with
absolute
dumbness
so
long
as
esther
dwelt
there
the
lodge
porter
seemed
to
live
in
mortal
terror
asie
had
perhaps
promised
poisoned
to
all
the
family
in
the
event
of
any
indiscretion
on
the
day
after
esther
s
removal
contenson
found
this
man
rather
more
amenable
he
regretted
the
lady
he
said
who
had
fed
him
with
the
broken
dishes
from
her
table
contenson
disguised
as
a
broker
tried
to
bargain
for
the
rooms
and
listened
to
the
porter
s
lamentations
while
he
fooled
him
casting
a
doubt
on
all
the
man
said
by
a
questioning
really
yes
monsieur
the
lady
lived
here
for
five
years
without
ever
going
out
and
more
by
token
her
lover
desperately
jealous
though
she
was
beyond
reproach
took
the
greatest
precautions
when
he
came
in
or
went
out
and
a
very
handsome
young
man
he
was
too
lucien
was
at
this
time
still
staying
with
his
sister
madame
sechard
but
as
soon
as
he
returned
contenson
sent
the
porter
to
the
quai
malaquais
to
ask
monsieur
de
rubempre
whether
he
were
willing
to
part
with
the
furniture
left
in
the
rooms
lately
occupied
by
madame
van
bogseck
the
porter
then
recognized
lucien
as
the
young
widow
s
mysterious
lover
and
this
was
all
that
contenson
wanted
the
deep
but
suppressed
astonishment
may
be
imagined
with
which
lucien
and
carlos
received
the
porter
whom
they
affected
to
regard
as
a
madman
they
tried
to
upset
his
convictions
within
hours
carlos
had
organized
a
force
which
detected
contenson
in
the
act
of
espionage
contenson
disguised
as
a
had
twice
already
brought
home
the
provisions
purchased
in
the
morning
by
asie
and
had
twice
got
into
the
little
mansion
in
the
rue
corentin
on
his
part
was
making
a
stir
but
he
was
stopped
short
by
recognizing
the
certain
identity
of
carlos
herrera
for
he
learned
at
once
that
this
abbe
the
secret
envoy
of
ferdinand
had
come
to
paris
towards
the
end
of
still
corentin
thought
it
worth
while
to
study
the
reasons
which
had
led
the
spaniard
to
take
an
interest
in
lucien
de
rubempre
it
was
soon
clear
to
him
beyond
doubt
that
esther
had
for
five
years
been
lucien
s
mistress
so
the
substitution
of
the
englishwoman
had
been
effected
for
the
advantage
of
that
young
dandy
now
lucien
had
no
means
he
was
rejected
as
a
suitor
for
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
and
he
had
just
bought
up
the
lands
of
rubempre
at
the
cost
of
a
million
francs
corentin
very
skilfully
made
the
head
of
the
general
police
take
the
first
steps
and
the
prefet
de
police
a
propos
to
peyrade
informed
his
chief
that
the
appellants
in
that
affair
had
been
in
fact
the
comte
de
serizy
and
lucien
de
rubempre
we
have
it
cried
peyrade
and
corentin
the
two
friends
had
laid
plans
in
a
moment
this
hussy
said
corentin
has
had
intimacies
she
must
have
some
women
friends
among
them
we
shall
certainly
find
one
or
another
who
is
down
on
her
luck
one
of
us
must
play
the
part
of
a
rich
foreigner
and
take
her
up
we
will
throw
them
together
they
always
want
something
of
each
other
in
the
game
of
lovers
and
we
shall
then
be
in
the
peyrade
naturally
proposed
to
assume
his
disguise
as
an
englishman
the
wild
life
he
should
lead
during
the
time
that
he
would
take
to
disentangle
the
plot
of
which
he
had
been
the
victim
smiled
on
his
fancy
while
corentin
grown
old
in
his
functions
and
weakly
too
did
not
care
for
it
disguised
as
a
mulatto
contenson
at
once
evaded
carlos
force
just
three
days
before
peyrade
s
meeting
with
madame
du
in
the
this
last
of
the
agents
employed
by
mm
de
sartine
and
lenoir
had
arrived
provided
with
a
passport
at
the
hotel
mirabeau
rue
de
la
paix
having
come
from
the
colonies
via
le
havre
in
a
traveling
chaise
as
as
though
it
had
really
come
from
le
havre
instead
of
no
further
than
by
the
road
from
to
paris
carlos
herrera
on
his
part
had
his
passport
at
the
spanish
embassy
and
arranged
everything
at
the
quai
malaquais
to
start
for
madrid
and
this
is
why
within
a
few
days
esther
was
to
become
the
owner
of
the
house
in
the
rue
and
of
shares
yielding
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
europe
and
asie
were
quite
cunning
enough
to
persuade
her
to
sell
these
shares
and
privately
transmit
the
money
to
lucien
thus
lucien
proclaiming
himself
rich
through
his
sister
s
liberality
would
pay
the
remainder
of
the
price
of
the
rubempre
estates
of
this
transaction
no
one
could
complain
esther
alone
could
betray
herself
but
she
would
die
rather
than
blink
an
eyelash
clotilde
had
appeared
with
a
little
pink
kerchief
round
her
crane
s
neck
so
she
had
won
her
game
at
the
hotel
de
grandlieu
the
shares
in
the
omnibus
company
were
already
worth
thrice
their
initial
value
carlos
by
disappearing
for
a
few
days
would
put
malice
off
the
scent
human
prudence
had
foreseen
everything
no
error
was
possible
the
false
spaniard
was
to
start
on
the
morrow
of
the
day
when
peyrade
met
madame
du
but
that
very
night
at
two
in
the
morning
asie
came
in
a
cab
to
the
quai
malaquais
and
found
the
stoker
of
the
machine
smoking
in
his
room
and
reconsidering
all
the
points
of
the
situation
here
stated
in
a
few
words
like
an
author
going
over
a
page
in
his
book
to
discover
any
faults
to
be
corrected
such
a
man
would
not
allow
himself
a
second
time
such
an
oversight
as
that
of
the
porter
in
the
rue
taitbout
paccard
whispered
asie
in
her
master
s
ear
recognized
contenson
yesterday
at
two
in
the
disguised
as
a
mulatto
servant
to
an
englishman
who
for
the
last
three
days
has
been
seen
walking
in
the
watching
esther
paccard
knew
the
hound
by
his
eyes
as
i
did
when
he
dressed
up
as
a
paccard
drove
the
girl
home
taking
a
round
so
as
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
wretch
contenson
is
at
the
hotel
mirabeau
but
he
exchanged
so
many
signs
of
intelligence
with
the
englishman
that
paccard
says
the
other
can
not
possibly
be
an
we
have
a
gadfly
behind
us
said
carlos
i
will
not
leave
till
the
day
after
that
contenson
is
certainly
the
man
who
sent
the
porter
after
us
from
the
rue
taitbout
we
must
ascertain
whether
this
sham
englishman
is
our
at
noon
samuel
johnson
s
black
servant
was
solemnly
waiting
on
his
master
who
always
breakfasted
too
heartily
with
a
purpose
peyrade
wished
to
pass
for
a
tippling
englishman
he
never
went
out
till
he
was
over
he
wore
black
cloth
gaiters
up
to
his
knees
and
padded
to
make
his
legs
look
stouter
his
trousers
were
lined
with
the
thickest
fustian
his
waistcoat
was
buttoned
up
to
his
cheeks
a
red
scratch
wig
hid
half
his
forehead
and
he
had
added
nearly
three
inches
to
his
height
in
short
the
oldest
frequenter
of
the
cafe
david
could
not
have
recognized
him
from
his
squarecut
coat
of
black
cloth
with
full
skirts
he
might
have
been
taken
for
an
english
millionaire
contenson
made
a
show
of
the
cold
insolence
of
a
nabob
s
confidential
servant
he
was
taciturn
abrupt
scornful
and
uncommunicative
and
indulged
in
fierce
exclamations
and
uncouth
gestures
peyrade
was
finishing
his
second
bottle
when
one
of
the
hotel
waiters
unceremoniously
showed
in
a
man
in
whom
peyrade
and
contenson
both
at
once
discerned
a
gendarme
in
mufti
monsieur
peyrade
said
the
gendarme
to
the
nabob
speaking
in
his
ear
my
instructions
are
to
take
you
to
the
peyrade
without
saying
a
word
rose
and
took
down
his
hat
you
will
find
a
hackney
coach
at
the
door
said
the
man
as
they
went
downstairs
the
prefet
thought
of
arresting
you
but
he
decided
on
sending
for
you
to
ask
some
explanation
of
your
conduct
through
the
whom
you
will
find
in
the
shall
i
ride
with
you
asked
the
gendarme
of
the
when
peyrade
had
got
in
no
replied
the
other
tell
the
coachman
quietly
to
drive
to
the
peyrade
and
carlos
were
now
face
to
face
in
the
coach
carlos
had
a
stiletto
under
his
hand
the
was
a
man
he
could
trust
quite
capable
of
allowing
carlos
to
get
out
without
seeing
him
or
being
surprised
on
arriving
at
his
journey
s
end
to
find
a
dead
body
in
his
cab
no
inquiries
are
ever
made
about
a
spy
the
law
almost
always
leaves
such
murders
unpunished
it
is
so
difficult
to
know
the
rights
of
the
case
peyrade
looked
with
his
keenest
eye
at
the
magistrate
sent
to
examine
him
by
the
prefet
of
police
carlos
struck
him
as
satisfactory
a
bald
head
deeply
wrinkled
at
the
back
and
powdered
hair
a
pair
of
very
light
gold
spectacles
with
glasses
over
weak
eyes
with
red
rims
evidently
needing
care
these
eyes
seemed
the
trace
of
some
squalid
malady
a
cotton
shirt
with
a
frill
a
shabby
black
satin
waistcoat
the
trousers
of
a
man
of
law
black
spun
silk
stockings
and
shoes
tied
with
ribbon
a
long
black
overcoat
cheap
gloves
black
and
worn
for
ten
days
and
a
gold
in
every
point
the
lower
grade
of
magistrate
known
by
a
perversion
of
terms
as
a
my
dear
monsieur
peyrade
i
regret
to
find
such
a
man
as
you
the
object
of
surveillance
and
that
you
should
act
so
as
to
justify
it
your
disguise
is
not
to
the
prefet
s
taste
if
you
fancy
that
you
can
thus
escape
our
vigilance
you
are
mistaken
you
traveled
from
england
by
way
of
no
repeated
peyrade
or
by
said
the
sham
lawyer
peyrade
lost
his
presence
of
mind
the
question
must
be
answered
now
any
reply
might
be
dangerous
in
the
affirmative
it
was
farcical
in
the
negative
if
this
man
knew
the
truth
it
would
be
peyrade
s
ruin
he
is
a
sharp
fellow
thought
he
he
tried
to
look
at
the
man
and
smile
and
he
gave
him
a
smile
for
an
answer
the
smile
passed
muster
without
protest
for
what
purpose
have
you
disguised
yourself
taken
rooms
at
the
mirabeau
and
dressed
contenson
as
a
black
servant
asked
the
monsieur
le
prefet
may
do
what
he
chooses
with
me
but
i
owe
no
account
of
my
actions
to
any
one
but
my
chief
said
peyrade
with
dignity
if
you
mean
me
to
infer
that
you
are
acting
by
the
orders
of
the
general
police
said
the
other
coldly
we
will
change
our
route
and
drive
to
the
rue
de
grenelle
instead
of
the
rue
de
jerusalem
i
have
clear
instructions
with
regard
to
you
but
be
careful
you
are
not
in
any
deep
disgrace
and
you
may
spoil
your
own
game
in
a
moment
as
for
me
i
owe
you
no
come
tell
me
the
well
then
this
is
the
truth
said
peyrade
with
a
glance
at
his
cerberus
red
eyes
the
sham
lawyer
s
face
remained
expressionless
impassible
he
was
doing
his
business
all
truths
were
the
same
to
him
he
looked
as
though
he
suspected
the
prefet
of
some
caprice
prefets
have
their
little
tantrums
i
have
fallen
desperately
in
love
with
a
woman
the
mistress
of
that
stockbroker
who
is
gone
abroad
for
his
own
pleasure
and
the
displeasure
of
his
creditors
madame
du
yes
replied
peyrade
to
keep
her
for
a
month
which
will
not
cost
me
more
than
a
thousand
crowns
i
have
got
myself
up
as
a
nabob
and
taken
contenson
as
my
servant
this
is
so
absolutely
true
monsieur
that
if
you
like
to
leave
me
in
the
coach
where
i
will
wait
for
you
on
my
honor
as
an
old
of
police
you
can
go
to
the
hotel
and
question
contenson
not
only
will
contenson
confirm
what
i
have
the
honor
of
stating
but
you
may
see
madame
du
s
who
is
to
come
this
morning
to
signify
her
mistress
acceptance
of
my
offers
or
the
conditions
she
makes
an
old
monkey
knows
what
grimaces
mean
i
have
offered
her
a
thousand
francs
a
month
and
a
carriage
that
comes
to
fifteen
hundred
five
hundred
francs
worth
of
presents
and
as
much
again
in
some
outings
dinners
and
you
see
i
am
not
deceiving
you
by
a
centime
when
i
say
a
thousand
a
man
of
my
age
may
well
spend
a
thousand
crowns
on
his
last
bless
me
papa
peyrade
and
you
still
care
enough
for
women
to
but
you
are
deceiving
me
i
am
sixty
myself
and
i
can
do
without
however
if
the
case
is
as
you
state
it
i
quite
understand
that
you
should
have
found
it
necessary
to
get
yourself
up
as
a
foreigner
to
indulge
your
you
can
understand
that
peyrade
or
old
canquoelle
of
the
rue
des
moineaux
ay
neither
of
them
would
have
suited
madame
du
carlos
put
in
delighted
to
have
picked
up
canquoelle
s
address
before
the
revolution
he
went
on
i
had
for
my
mistress
a
woman
who
had
previously
been
kept
by
the
as
they
then
called
the
executioner
one
evening
at
the
play
she
pricked
herself
with
a
pin
and
cried
out
a
customary
ejaculation
in
those
days
ah
bourreau
on
which
her
neighbor
asked
her
if
this
were
a
reminiscence
well
my
dear
peyrade
she
cast
off
her
man
for
that
speech
i
suppose
you
have
no
wish
to
expose
yourself
to
such
a
slap
in
the
madame
du
is
a
woman
for
gentlemen
i
saw
her
once
at
the
opera
and
thought
her
very
handsome
tell
the
driver
to
go
back
to
the
rue
de
la
paix
my
dear
peyrade
i
will
go
upstairs
with
you
to
your
rooms
and
see
for
myself
a
verbal
report
will
no
doubt
be
enough
for
monsieur
le
carlos
took
a
from
his
a
black
lined
with
and
offered
it
to
peyrade
with
an
impulse
of
delightful
peyrade
said
to
himself
and
these
are
their
agents
good
heavens
what
would
monsieur
lenoir
say
if
he
could
come
back
to
life
or
monsieur
de
sartines
that
is
part
of
the
truth
no
doubt
but
it
is
not
all
said
the
sham
lawyer
sniffing
up
his
pinch
of
snuff
you
have
had
a
finger
in
the
baron
de
nucingen
s
love
affairs
and
you
wish
no
doubt
to
entangle
him
in
some
you
missed
fire
with
the
pistol
and
you
are
aiming
at
him
with
a
madame
du
is
a
friend
of
madame
de
champy
s
devil
take
it
i
must
take
care
not
to
founder
said
peyrade
to
himself
he
is
a
better
man
than
i
thought
him
he
is
playing
me
he
talks
of
letting
me
go
and
he
goes
on
making
me
well
asked
carlos
with
a
magisterial
air
monsieur
it
is
true
that
i
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
seek
a
woman
in
monsieur
de
nucingen
s
behoof
because
he
was
half
mad
with
love
that
is
the
cause
of
my
being
out
of
favor
for
it
would
seem
that
quite
unconsciously
i
touched
some
important
the
officer
of
the
law
remained
immovable
but
after
years
experience
peyrade
went
on
i
know
the
police
well
enough
to
have
held
my
hand
after
the
blowing
up
i
had
from
monsieur
le
prefet
who
no
doubt
was
right
then
you
would
give
up
this
fancy
if
monsieur
le
prefet
required
it
of
you
that
i
think
would
be
the
best
proof
you
could
give
of
the
sincerity
of
what
you
he
is
going
it
he
is
going
it
thought
peyrade
ah
by
all
that
s
holy
the
police
is
a
match
for
that
of
monsieur
give
it
up
said
he
aloud
i
will
wait
till
i
have
monsieur
le
prefet
s
but
here
we
are
at
the
hotel
if
you
wish
to
come
where
do

the
money
said
carlos
with
a
sagacious
glance
monsieur
i
have
a
friend
get
along
said
carlos
go
and
tell
that
story
to
an
examining
magistrate
this
audacious
stroke
on
carlos
part
was
the
outcome
of
one
of
those
calculations
so
simple
that
none
but
a
man
of
his
temper
would
have
thought
it
out
at
a
very
early
hour
he
had
sent
lucien
to
madame
de
serizy
s
lucien
had
begged
the
count
s
private
secretary
as
from
the
count
to
go
and
obtain
from
the
prefet
of
police
full
particulars
concerning
the
agent
employed
by
the
baron
de
nucingen
the
secretary
came
back
provided
with
a
note
concerning
peyrade
a
copy
of
the
summary
noted
on
the
back
of
his
record
in
the
police
force
since
having
come
to
paris
from
avignon
two
years
previously
without
money
or
character
possessed
of
certain
state
secrets
lives
in
the
rue
des
moineaux
under
the
name
of
canquoelle
the
name
of
a
little
estate
where
his
family
resides
in
the
department
of
vaucluse
very
respectable
people
was
lately
inquired
for
by
a
named
theodore
de
la
peyrade
see
the
report
of
an
agent
no
of
the
documents
he
must
be
the
man
to
whom
contenson
is
playing
the
mulatto
servant
cried
carlos
when
lucien
returned
with
other
information
besides
this
note
within
three
hours
this
man
with
the
energy
of
a
had
found
by
paccard
s
help
an
innocent
accomplice
capable
of
playing
the
part
of
a
gendarme
in
disguise
and
had
got
himself
up
as
a
three
times
in
the
coach
he
had
thought
of
killing
peyrade
but
he
had
made
it
a
rule
never
to
commit
a
murder
with
his
own
hand
he
promised
himself
that
he
would
get
rid
of
peyrade
all
in
good
time
by
pointing
him
out
as
a
millionaire
to
some
released
convicts
about
the
town
peyrade
and
his
mentor
as
they
went
in
heard
contenson
s
voice
arguing
with
madame
du
s
maid
peyrade
signed
to
carlos
to
remain
in
the
outer
room
with
a
look
meant
to
convey
thus
you
can
assure
yourself
of
my
madame
agrees
to
everything
said
adele
madame
is
at
this
moment
calling
on
a
friend
madame
de
champy
who
has
some
rooms
in
the
rue
taitbout
on
her
hands
for
a
year
full
of
furniture
which
she
will
let
her
have
no
doubt
madame
can
receive
johnson
more
suitably
there
for
the
furniture
is
still
very
decent
and
monsieur
might
buy
it
for
madame
by
coming
to
an
agreement
with
madame
de
very
good
my
girl
if
this
is
not
a
job
of
fleecing
it
is
a
bit
of
the
wool
said
the
mulatto
to
the
astonished
woman
however
we
will
go
shares
that
is
your
darkey
all
over
cried
mademoiselle
adele
if
your
nabob
is
a
nabob
he
can
very
well
afford
to
give
madame
the
furniture
the
lease
ends
in
april
your
nabob
may
renew
it
if
he
i
am
quite
willing
said
peyrade
speaking
french
with
a
strong
english
accent
as
he
came
in
and
tapped
the
woman
on
the
shoulder
he
cast
a
knowing
look
back
at
carlos
who
replied
by
an
assenting
nod
understanding
that
the
nabob
was
to
keep
up
his
part
but
the
scene
suddenly
changed
its
aspect
at
the
entrance
of
a
person
over
whom
neither
carlos
nor
peyrade
had
the
least
power
corentin
suddenly
came
in
he
had
found
the
door
open
and
looked
in
as
he
went
by
to
see
how
his
old
friend
played
his
part
as
nabob
the
prefet
is
still
bullying
me
said
peyrade
in
a
whisper
to
corentin
he
has
found
me
out
as
a
we
will
spill
the
prefet
corentin
muttered
in
reply
then
after
a
cool
bow
he
stood
darkly
scrutinizing
the
magistrate
stay
here
till
i
return
said
carlos
i
will
go
to
the
prefecture
if
you
do
not
see
me
again
you
may
go
your
own
having
said
this
in
an
undertone
to
peyrade
so
as
not
to
humiliate
him
in
the
presence
of
the
carlos
went
away
not
caring
to
remain
under
the
eye
of
the
newcomer
in
whom
he
detected
one
of
those
men
coldly
terrifying
that
is
the
sent
after
me
by
the
prefet
said
peyrade
that
said
corentin
you
have
walked
into
a
trap
that
man
has
three
packs
of
cards
in
his
shoes
you
can
see
that
by
the
place
of
his
foot
in
the
shoe
besides
a
need
wear
no
corentin
hurried
downstairs
to
verify
his
suspicions
carlos
was
getting
into
the
fly
hallo
monsieur
l
abbe
cried
corentin
carlos
looked
around
saw
corentin
and
got
in
quickly
still
corentin
had
time
to
say
that
was
all
i
wanted
to
quai
malaquais
he
shouted
to
the
driver
with
diabolical
mockery
in
his
tone
and
expression
i
am
done
said
jacques
collin
to
himself
they
have
got
me
i
must
get
ahead
of
them
by
sheer
pace
and
above
all
find
out
what
they
want
of
corentin
had
seen
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
five
or
six
times
and
the
man
s
eyes
were
unforgettable
corentin
had
suspected
him
at
once
from
the
cut
of
his
shoulders
then
by
his
puffy
face
and
the
trick
of
three
inches
of
added
height
gained
by
a
heel
inside
the
shoe
ah
old
fellow
they
have
drawn
you
said
corentin
finding
no
one
in
the
room
but
peyrade
and
contenson
who
cried
peyrade
with
metallic
hardness
i
will
spend
my
last
days
in
putting
him
on
a
gridiron
and
turning
him
on
it
is
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
the
corentin
of
spain
as
i
suppose
this
explains
everything
the
spaniard
is
a
demon
of
the
first
water
who
has
tried
to
make
a
fortune
for
that
little
young
man
by
coining
money
out
of
a
pretty
baggage
s
it
is
your
lookout
if
you
think
you
can
measure
your
skill
with
a
man
who
seems
to
me
the
very
devil
to
deal
oh
exclaimed
contenson
he
fingered
the
three
hundred
thousand
francs
the
day
when
esther
was
arrested
he
was
in
the
cab
i
remember
those
eyes
that
brow
and
those
marks
of
the
oh
what
a
fortune
my
lydie
might
have
had
cried
peyrade
you
may
still
play
the
nabob
said
corentin
to
keep
an
eye
on
esther
you
must
keep
up
her
intimacy
with
she
was
really
lucien
s
they
have
got
more
than
five
hundred
thousand
francs
out
of
nucingen
already
said
contenson
and
they
want
as
much
again
corentin
went
on
the
rubempre
estate
is
to
cost
a
daddy
added
he
slapping
peyrade
on
the
shoulder
you
may
get
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
francs
to
settle
on
don
t
tell
me
that
corentin
if
your
scheme
should
fail
i
can
not
tell
what
i
might
not
do
you
will
have
it
by
perhaps
the
abbe
my
dear
fellow
is
most
astute
we
shall
have
to
kiss
his
spurs
he
is
a
very
superior
devil
but
i
have
him
sure
enough
he
is
not
a
fool
and
he
will
knock
under
try
to
be
a
gaby
as
well
as
a
nabob
and
fear
in
the
evening
of
this
day
when
the
opposing
forces
had
met
face
to
face
on
level
ground
lucien
spent
the
evening
at
the
hotel
grandlieu
the
party
was
a
large
one
in
the
face
of
all
the
assembly
the
duchess
kept
lucien
at
her
side
for
some
time
and
was
most
kind
to
him
you
are
going
away
for
a
little
while
said
she
yes
madame
la
duchesse
my
sister
in
her
anxiety
to
promote
my
marriage
has
made
great
sacrifices
and
i
have
been
enabled
to
repurchase
the
lands
of
the
rubempres
to
reconstitute
the
whole
estate
but
i
have
found
in
my
paris
lawyer
a
very
clever
man
who
has
managed
to
save
me
from
the
extortionate
terms
that
the
holders
would
have
asked
if
they
had
known
the
name
of
the
is
there
a
chateau
asked
clotilde
with
too
broad
a
smile
there
is
something
which
might
be
called
a
chateau
but
the
wiser
plan
would
be
to
use
the
building
materials
in
the
construction
of
a
modern
clotilde
s
eyes
blazed
with
happiness
above
her
smile
of
satisfaction
you
must
play
a
rubber
with
my
father
this
evening
said
she
in
a
fortnight
i
hope
you
will
be
asked
to
well
my
dear
sir
said
the
duc
de
grandlieu
i
am
told
that
you
have
bought
the
estate
of
rubempre
i
congratulate
you
it
is
an
answer
to
those
who
say
you
are
in
debt
we
bigwigs
like
france
or
england
are
allowed
to
have
a
public
debt
but
men
of
no
fortune
beginners
you
see
may
not
assume
that
privilege
indeed
monsieur
le
duc
i
still
owe
five
hundred
thousand
francs
on
my
well
well
you
must
marry
a
wife
who
can
bring
you
the
money
but
you
will
have
some
difficulty
in
finding
a
match
with
such
a
fortune
in
our
faubourg
where
daughters
do
not
get
large
their
name
is
enough
said
lucien
we
are
only
three
wisk
players
maufrigneuse
d
espard
and
i
will
you
make
a
fourth
said
the
duke
pointing
to
the
clotilde
came
to
the
table
to
watch
her
father
s
game
she
expects
me
to
believe
that
she
means
it
for
me
said
the
duke
patting
his
daughter
s
hands
and
looking
round
at
lucien
who
remained
quite
grave
lucien
monsieur
d
espard
s
partner
lost
twenty
louis
my
dear
mother
said
clotilde
to
the
duchess
he
was
so
judicious
as
to
at
eleven
o
clock
after
a
few
affectionate
words
with
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
lucien
went
home
and
to
bed
thinking
of
the
complete
triumph
he
was
to
enjoy
a
month
hence
for
he
had
not
a
doubt
of
being
accepted
as
clotilde
s
lover
and
married
before
lent
in
on
the
morrow
when
lucien
was
smoking
his
cigarettes
after
breakfast
sitting
with
carlos
who
had
become
much
depressed
de
was
announced
what
a
touch
of
irony
who
begged
to
see
either
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
or
monsieur
lucien
de
rubempre
was
he
told
downstairs
that
i
had
left
paris
cried
the
abbe
yes
sir
replied
the
groom
well
then
you
must
see
the
man
said
he
to
lucien
but
do
not
say
a
single
compromising
word
do
not
let
a
sign
of
surprise
escape
you
it
is
the
you
will
overhear
me
said
lucien
carlos
hid
in
the
adjoining
room
and
through
the
crack
of
the
door
he
saw
corentin
whom
he
recognized
only
by
his
voice
such
powers
of
transformation
did
the
great
man
possess
this
time
corentin
looked
like
an
old
i
have
not
had
the
honor
of
being
known
to
you
monsieur
corentin
began
but
excuse
my
interrupting
you
monsieur
but
but
the
matter
in
point
is
your
marriage
to
mademoiselle
clotilde
de
grandlieu
which
will
never
take
place
corentin
added
eagerly
lucien
sat
down
and
made
no
reply
you
are
in
the
power
of
a
man
who
is
able
and
willing
and
ready
to
prove
to
the
duc
de
grandlieu
that
the
lands
of
rubempre
are
to
be
paid
for
with
the
money
that
a
fool
has
given
to
your
mistress
mademoiselle
esther
corentin
went
on
it
will
be
quite
easy
to
find
the
minutes
of
the
legal
opinions
in
virtue
of
which
mademoiselle
esther
was
summoned
there
are
ways
too
of
making
d
estourny
speak
the
very
clever
manoeuvres
employed
against
the
baron
de
nucingen
will
be
brought
to
light
as
yet
all
can
be
arranged
pay
down
a
hundred
thousand
francs
and
you
will
have
all
this
is
no
concern
of
mine
i
am
only
the
agent
of
those
who
levy
this
blackmail
nothing
corentin
might
have
talked
for
an
hour
lucien
smoked
his
cigarette
with
an
air
of
perfect
indifference
monsieur
replied
he
i
do
not
want
to
know
who
you
are
for
men
who
undertake
such
jobs
as
these
have
no
name
at
any
rate
in
my
vocabulary
i
have
allowed
you
to
talk
at
your
leisure
i
am
at
you
seem
to
me
not
bereft
of
common
sense
listen
to
my
there
was
a
pause
during
which
lucien
met
corentin
s
eye
fixed
on
him
with
a
perfectly
icy
stare
either
you
are
building
on
facts
that
are
absolutely
false
and
i
need
pay
no
heed
to
them
said
lucien
or
you
are
in
the
right
and
in
that
case
by
giving
you
a
hundred
thousand
francs
i
put
you
in
a
position
to
ask
me
for
as
many
hundred
thousand
francs
as
your
employer
can
find
to
ask
for
however
to
put
an
end
once
and
for
all
to
your
kind
intervention
i
would
have
you
know
that
i
lucien
de
rubempre
fear
no
one
i
have
no
part
in
the
jobbery
of
which
you
speak
if
the
grandlieus
make
difficulties
there
are
other
young
ladies
of
very
good
family
ready
to
be
married
after
all
it
is
no
loss
to
me
if
i
remain
single
especially
if
as
you
imagine
i
deal
in
blank
bills
to
such
if
monsieur
l
abbe
carlos
herrera
monsieur
lucien
put
in
the
abbe
herrera
is
at
this
moment
on
the
way
to
spain
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
marriage
my
interests
are
no
concern
of
his
that
remarkable
statesman
was
good
enough
to
assist
me
at
one
time
with
his
advice
but
he
has
reports
to
present
to
his
majesty
the
king
of
spain
if
you
have
anything
to
say
to
him
i
recommend
you
to
set
out
for
monsieur
said
corentin
plainly
you
will
never
be
mademoiselle
clotilde
de
grandlieu
s
so
much
the
worse
for
her
replied
lucien
impatiently
pushing
corentin
towards
the
door
you
have
fully
considered
the
matter
asked
corentin
coldly
monsieur
i
do
not
recognize
that
you
have
any
right
either
to
meddle
in
my
affairs
or
to
make
me
waste
a
cigarette
said
lucien
throwing
away
his
cigarette
that
had
gone
out
monsieur
said
corentin
we
shall
not
meet
but
there
will
certainly
be
a
moment
in
your
life
when
you
would
give
half
your
fortune
to
have
called
me
back
from
these
in
answer
to
this
threat
carlos
made
as
though
he
were
cutting
off
a
head
now
to
business
cried
he
looking
at
lucien
who
was
as
white
as
ashes
after
this
dreadful
interview
if
among
the
small
number
of
my
readers
who
take
an
interest
in
the
moral
and
philosophical
side
of
this
book
there
should
be
only
one
capable
of
believing
that
the
baron
de
nucingen
was
happy
that
one
would
prove
how
difficult
it
is
to
explain
the
heart
of
a
courtesan
by
any
kind
of
physiological
formula
esther
was
resolved
to
make
the
poor
millionaire
pay
dearly
for
what
he
called
his
day
of
triumph
and
at
the
beginning
of
february
the
party
had
not
yet
been
given
in
the
little
well
said
esther
in
confidence
to
her
friends
who
repeated
it
to
the
baron
i
shall
open
house
at
the
carnival
and
i
mean
to
make
my
man
as
happy
as
a
cock
in
the
phrase
became
proverbial
among
women
of
her
kidney
the
baron
gave
vent
to
much
lamentation
like
married
men
he
made
himself
very
ridiculous
he
began
to
complain
to
his
intimate
friends
and
his
dissatisfaction
was
generally
known
esther
meanwhile
took
quite
a
serious
view
of
her
position
as
the
pompadour
of
this
prince
of
speculators
she
had
given
two
or
three
small
evening
parties
solely
to
get
lucien
into
the
house
lousteau
rastignac
du
tillet

brambourg
all
the
cream
of
the
dissipated
crew
frequented
her
and
as
leading
ladies
in
the
piece
she
was
playing
esther
accepted
tullia
florentine
fanny
beaupre
and
florine
two
dancers
and
two
actresses
besides
madame
du
nothing
can
be
more
dreary
than
a
courtesan
s
home
without
the
spice
of
rivalry
the
display
of
dress
and
some
variety
of
type
in
six
weeks
esther
had
become
the
wittiest
the
most
amusing
the
loveliest
and
the
most
elegant
of
those
female
pariahs
who
form
the
class
of
kept
women
placed
on
the
pedestal
that
became
her
she
enjoyed
all
the
delights
of
vanity
which
fascinate
women
in
general
but
still
as
one
who
is
raised
above
her
caste
by
a
secret
thought
she
cherished
in
her
heart
an
image
of
herself
which
she
gloried
in
while
it
made
her
blush
the
hour
when
she
must
abdicate
was
ever
present
to
her
consciousness
thus
she
lived
a
double
life
really
scorning
herself
her
sarcastic
remarks
were
tinged
by
the
temper
which
was
roused
in
her
by
the
intense
contempt
felt
by
the
angel
of
love
hidden
in
the
courtesan
for
the
disgraceful
and
odious
part
played
by
the
body
in
the
presence
as
it
were
of
the
soul
at
once
actor
and
spectator
victim
and
judge
she
was
a
living
realization
of
the
beautiful
arabian
tales
in
which
a
noble
creature
lies
hidden
under
a
degrading
form
and
of
which
the
type
is
the
story
of
nebuchadnezzar
in
the
book
of
books
the
bible
having
granted
herself
a
lease
of
life
till
the
day
after
her
infidelity
the
victim
might
surely
play
awhile
with
the
executioner
moreover
the
enlightenment
that
had
come
to
esther
as
to
the
secretly
disgraceful
means
by
which
the
baron
had
made
his
colossal
fortune
relieved
her
of
every
scruple
she
could
play
the
part
of
ate
the
goddess
of
vengeance
as
carlos
said
and
so
she
was
by
turns
enchanting
and
odious
to
the
banker
who
lived
only
for
her
when
the
baron
had
been
worked
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
suffering
that
he
wanted
only
to
be
quit
of
esther
she
brought
him
round
by
a
scene
of
tender
affection
herrera
making
a
great
show
of
starting
for
spain
had
gone
as
far
as
tours
he
had
sent
the
chaise
on
as
far
as
bordeaux
with
a
servant
inside
engaged
to
play
the
part
of
master
and
to
wait
for
him
at
bordeaux
then
returning
by
diligence
dressed
as
a
commercial
traveler
he
had
secretly
taken
up
his
abode
under
esther
s
roof
and
thence
aided
by
asie
and
europe
carefully
directed
all
his
machinations
keeping
an
eye
on
every
one
and
especially
on
peyrade
about
a
fortnight
before
the
day
chosen
for
her
great
entertainment
which
was
to
be
given
in
the
evening
after
the
first
opera
ball
the
courtesan
whose
witticisms
were
beginning
to
make
her
feared
happened
to
be
at
the
italian
opera
at
the
back
of
a
box
which
the
baron
forced
to
give
a
box
had
secured
in
the
lowest
tier
in
order
to
conceal
his
mistress
and
not
to
flaunt
her
in
public
within
a
few
feet
of
madame
de
nucingen
esther
had
taken
her
seat
so
as
to
rake
that
of
madame
de
serizy
whom
lucien
almost
invariably
accompanied
the
poor
girl
made
her
whole
happiness
centre
in
watching
lucien
on
tuesdays
thursdays
and
saturdays
by
madame
de
serizy
s
side
at
about
nine
in
the
evening
esther
could
see
lucien
enter
the
countess
box
with
a
brow
pale
and
with
almost
drawn
features
these
symptoms
of
mental
anguish
were
legible
only
to
esther
the
knowledge
of
a
man
s
countenance
is
to
the
woman
who
loves
him
like
that
of
the
sea
to
a
sailor
good
god
what
can
be
the
matter
what
has
happened
does
he
want
to
speak
with
that
angel
of
hell
who
is
to
him
a
guardian
angel
and
who
lives
in
an
attic
between
those
of
europe
and
asie
tormented
by
such
reflections
esther
scarcely
listened
to
the
music
still
less
it
may
be
believed
did
she
listen
to
the
baron
who
held
one
of
his
anchel
s
hands
in
both
his
talking
to
her
in
his
horrible
accent
a
jargon
which
must
be
as
unpleasant
to
read
as
it
is
to
hear
spoken
esther
said
he
releasing
her
hand
and
pushing
it
away
with
a
slight
touch
of
temper
you
do
not
listen
to
i
tell
you
what
baron
you
blunder
in
love
as
you
gibber
in
i
am
not
in
my
boudoir
here
i
am
at
the
opera
if
you
were
not
a
barrel
made
by
huret
or
fichet
metamorphosed
into
a
man
by
some
trick
of
nature
you
would
not
make
so
much
noise
in
a
box
with
a
woman
who
is
fond
of
music
i
don
t
listen
to
you
i
should
think
not
there
you
sit
rustling
my
dress
like
a
cockchafer
in
a
and
making
me
laugh
with
contempt
you
say
to
me
you
are
so
pretty
i
should
like
to
eat
you
old
simpleton
supposing
i
were
to
say
to
you
you
are
less
intolerable
this
evening
than
you
were
yesterday
we
will
go
home
well
from
the
way
you
puff
and
sigh
for
i
feel
you
if

to
you

perceive
that
you
have
eaten
an
enormous
dinner
and
your
digestion
is
at
work
let
me
instruct
you
for
i
cost
you
enough
to
give
some
advice
for
your
money
now
and
then
let
me
tell
you
my
dear
fellow
that
a
man
whose
digestion
is
so
troublesome
as
yours
is
is
not
justified
in
telling
his
mistress
that
she
is
pretty
at
unseemly
hours
an
old
soldier
died
of
that
very
folly
in
the
arms
of
religion

cruel
cried
the
baron
recognizing
the
profound
truth
of
this
medical
argument
cruel
echoed
esther
still
looking
at
lucien
have
you
not
consulted
bianchon
desplein
old
haudry
since
you
have
had
a
glimpse
of
future
happiness
do
you
know
what
you
seem
like
to
me
no
vat
a
fat
old
fellow
wrapped
in
flannel
who
walks
every
hour
from

armchair
to
the
window
to

the
thermometer

risen
to
the
degree
marked
the
temperature
prescribed

his
you

really
an
ungrateful
slut
cried
the
baron
in
despair
at
hearing
a
tune
which
however
amorous
old
men
not
unfrequently
hear
at
the
opera
ungrateful
retorted
esther

the
banker
with
a
lengthened
face
very
well

esther

to
make
your
pillows
very
high
and

the
baron
was
standing
up
and
held
the
in
his
hand
here
nucingen
said
esther
with
an
imperious
gesture
the
baron
bent
over
her
with
devotion
do

sweet
and
giving
you
and

not
fail
to
come
if

succeed
in
that
little
transaction
i
will
tell
you
that
i
love
you
my
fat
frederic
in
such
plain
terms
that
you
can
not
but
believe
you
are
an
enchantress
said
the
baron
kissing
esther
s
glove
i
should
be
villing
to
listen
to
abuse
for
ein
hour
if
alvays
der
vas
a
kiss
at
de
ent
of
but
if
i
am
not
obeyed
i
and
she
threatened
the
baron
with
her
finger
as
we
threaten
children
the
baron
raised
his
head
like
a
bird
caught
in
a
springe
and
imploring
the
trapper
s
pity
dear
heaven
what
ails
lucien
said
she
to
herself
when
she
was
alone
making
no
attempt
to
check
her
falling
tears
i
never
saw
him
so
this
is
what
had
happened
to
lucien
that
very
evening
at
nine
o
clock
he
had
gone
out
as
he
did
every
evening
in
his
brougham
to
go
to
the
hotel
de
grandlieu
using
his
and
cab
in
the
morning
only
like
all
young
men
he
had
hired
a
brougham
for
winter
evenings
and
had
chosen
a
carriage
and
splendid
horses
from
one
of
the
best
for
the
last
month
all
had
gone
well
with
him
he
had
dined
with
the
grandlieus
three
times
the
duke
was
delightful
to
him
his
shares
in
the
omnibus
company
sold
for
three
hundred
thousand
francs
had
paid
off
a
third
more
of
the
price
of
the
land
clotilde
de
grandlieu
who
dressed
beautifully
now
reddened
inch
thick
when
he
went
into
the
room
and
loudly
proclaimed
her
attachment
to
him
some
personages
of
high
estate
discussed
their
marriage
as
a
probable
event
the
duc
de
chaulieu
formerly
ambassador
to
spain
and
now
for
a
short
while
minister
for
foreign
affairs
had
promised
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
that
he
would
ask
for
the
title
of
marquis
for
lucien
so
that
evening
after
dining
with
madame
de
serizy
lucien
had
driven
to
the
faubourg
to
pay
his
daily
visit
he
arrives
the
coachman
calls
for
the
gate
to
be
opened
he
drives
into
the
courtyard
and
stops
at
the
steps
lucien
on
getting
out
remarks
four
other
carriages
in
waiting
on
seeing
monsieur
de
rubempre
one
of
the
footmen
placed
to
open
and
shut
the
comes
forward
and
out
on
to
the
steps
in
front
of
the
door
like
a
soldier
on
guard
his
grace
is
not
at
home
says
he
madame
la
duchesse
is
receiving
company
observes
lucien
to
the
servant
madame
la
duchesse
is
gone
out
replies
the
man
solemnly
mademoiselle
clotilde
i
do
not
think
that
mademoiselle
clotilde
will
see
you
monsieur
in
the
absence
of
madame
la
but
there
are
people
here
replies
lucien
in
dismay
i
do
not
know
sir
says
the
man
trying
to
seem
stupid
and
to
be
respectful
there
is
nothing
more
fatal
than
etiquette
to
those
who
regard
it
as
the
most
formidable
arm
of
social
law
lucien
easily
interpreted
the
meaning
of
this
scene
so
disastrous
to
him
the
duke
and
duchess
would
not
admit
him
he
felt
the
spinal
marrow
freezing
in
the
core
of
his
vertebral
column
and
a
sickly
cold
sweat
bedewed
his
brow
the
conversation
had
taken
place
in
the
presence
of
his
own
who
held
the
door
of
the
brougham
doubting
whether
to
shut
it
lucien
signed
to
him
that
he
was
going
away
again
but
as
he
stepped
into
the
carriage
he
heard
the
noise
of
people
coming
downstairs
and
the
servant
called
out
first
madame
la
duchesse
de
chaulieu
s
people
then
madame
la
vicomtesse
de
grandlieu
s
carriage
lucien
merely
said
to
the
italian
opera
but
in
spite
of
his
haste
the
luckless
dandy
could
not
escape
the
duc
de
chaulieu
and
his
son
the
duc
de
rhetore
to
whom
he
was
obliged
to
bow
for
they
did
not
speak
a
word
to
him
a
great
catastrophe
at
court
the
fall
of
a
formidable
favorite
has
ere
now
been
pronounced
on
the
threshold
of
a
royal
study
in
one
word
from
an
usher
with
a
face
like
a
plaster
cast
how
am
i
to
let
my
adviser
know
of
this
disaster
this
instant
thought
lucien
as
he
drove
to
the
what
is
going
on
he
racked
his
brain
with
conjectures
this
was
what
had
taken
place
that
morning
at
eleven
o
clock
the
duc
de
grandlieu
as
he
went
into
the
little
room
where
the
family
all
breakfasted
together
said
to
clotilde
after
kissing
her
until
further
orders
my
child
think
no
more
of
the
sieur
de
then
he
had
taken
the
duchesse
by
the
hand
and
led
her
into
a
window
recess
to
say
a
few
words
in
an
undertone
which
made
poor
clotilde
turn
pale
for
she
watched
her
mother
as
she
listened
to
the
duke
and
saw
her
expression
of
extreme
surprise
jean
said
the
duke
to
one
of
his
servants
take
this
note
to
monsieur
le
duc
de
chaulieu
and
beg
him
to
answer
by
you
yes
or
i
am
asking
him
to
dine
here
he
added
to
his
wife
breakfast
had
been
a
most
melancholy
meal
the
duchess
was
meditative
the
duke
seemed
to
be
vexed
with
himself
and
clotilde
could
with
difficulty
restrain
her
tears
my
child
your
father
is
right
you
must
obey
him
the
mother
had
said
to
the
daughter
with
much
emotion
i
do
not
say
as
he
does
think
no
more
of
no
for
i
understand
your
suffering
clotilde
kissed
her
mother
s
hand
but
i
do
say
my
darling
wait
take
no
step
suffer
in
silence
since
you
love
him
and
put
your
trust
in
your
parents
great
ladies
my
child
are
great
just
because
they
can
do
their
duty
on
every
occasion
and
do
it
but
what
is
it
about
asked
clotilde
as
white
as
a
lily
matters
too
serious
to
be
discussed
with
you
my
dearest
the
duchess
replied
for
if
they
are
untrue
your
mind
would
be
unnecessarily
sullied
and
if
they
are
true
you
must
never
know
at
six
o
clock
the
duc
de
chaulieu
had
come
to
join
the
duc
de
grandlieu
who
awaited
him
in
his
study
tell
me
henri
for
the
dukes
were
on
the
most
familiar
terms
and
addressed
each
other
by
their
christian
names
this
is
one
of
the
shades
invented
to
mark
a
degree
of
intimacy
to
repel
the
audacity
of
french
familiarity
and
humiliate
conceit
tell
me
henri
i
am
in
such
a
desperate
difficulty
that
i
can
only
ask
advice
of
an
old
friend
who
understands
business
and
you
have
practice
and
experience
my
daughter
clotilde
as
you
know
is
in
love
with
that
little
rubempre
whom
i
have
been
almost
compelled
to
accept
as
her
promised
husband
i
have
always
been
averse
to
the
marriage
however
madame
de
grandlieu
could
not
bear
to
thwart
clotilde
s
passion
when
the
young
fellow
had
repurchased
the
family
estate
and
paid
of
the
price
i
could
make
no
further
objections
but
last
evening
i
received
an
anonymous
letter
you
know
how
much
that
is
worth
in
which
i
am
informed
that
the
young
fellow
s
fortune
is
derived
from
some
disreputable
source
and
that
he
is
telling
lies
when
he
says
that
his
sister
is
giving
him
the
necessary
funds
for
his
purchase
for
my
daughter
s
happiness
and
for
the
sake
of
our
family
i
am
adjured
to
make
inquiries
and
the
means
of
doing
so
are
suggested
to
me
here
read
i
am
entirely
of
your
opinion
as
to
the
value
of
anonymous
letters
my
dear
ferdinand
said
the
duc
de
chaulieu
after
reading
the
letter
still
though
we
may
contemn
them
we
must
make
use
of
them
we
must
treat
such
letters
as
we
would
treat
a
spy
keep
the
young
man
out
of
the
house
and
let
us
make
inquiries
i
know
how
to
do
it
your
lawyer
is
derville
a
man
in
whom
we
have
perfect
confidence
he
knows
the
secrets
of
many
families
and
can
certainly
be
trusted
with
this
he
is
an
honest
man
a
man
of
weight
and
a
man
of
honor
he
is
cunning
and
wily
but
his
wiliness
is
only
in
the
way
of
business
and
you
need
only
employ
him
to
obtain
evidence
you
can
depend
upon
we
have
in
the
foreign
office
an
agent
of
the
superior
police
who
is
unique
in
his
power
of
discovering
state
secrets
we
often
send
him
on
such
missions
inform
derville
that
he
will
have
a
lieutenant
in
the
case
our
spy
is
a
gentleman
who
will
appear
wearing
the
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
looking
like
a
diplomate
this
rascal
will
do
the
hunting
derville
will
only
look
on
your
lawyer
will
then
tell
you
if
the
mountain
brings
forth
a
mouse
or
if
you
must
throw
over
this
little
rubempre
within
a
week
you
will
know
what
you
are
the
young
man
is
not
yet
so
far
a
marquis
as
to
take
offence
at
my
being
not
at
home
for
a
week
said
the
duc
de
grandlieu
above
all
if
you
end
by
giving
him
your
daughter
replied
the
minister
if
the
anonymous
letter
tells
the
truth
what
of
that
you
can
send
clotilde
to
travel
with
my
madeleine
who
wants
to
go
to
you
relieve
me
immensely
i
don
t
know
whether
i
ought
to
thank
wait
till
the
by
the
way
exclaimed
the
duc
de
grandlieu
what
is
your
man
s
name
i
must
mention
it
to
derville
send
him
to
me
by
five
o
clock
i
will
have
derville
here
and
put
them
in
his
real
name
said
de
chaulieu
is
i
think
corentin
a
name
you
must
never
have
heard
for
my
gentleman
will
come
ticketed
with
his
official
name
he
calls
himself
monsieur
de
saint
yves
something
of
the
you
may
trust
him
louis
xviii
had
perfect
confidence
in
after
this
confabulation
the
steward
had
orders
to
shut
the
door
on
monsieur
de
rubempre
which
was
done
lucien
paced
the
at
the
like
a
man
who
was
drunk
he
fancied
himself
the
talk
of
all
paris
he
had
in
the
duc
de
rhetore
one
of
those
unrelenting
enemies
on
whom
a
man
must
smile
as
he
can
never
be
revenged
since
their
attacks
are
in
conformity
with
the
rules
of
society
the
duc
de
rhetore
knew
the
scene
that
had
just
taken
place
on
the
outside
steps
of
the
grandlieus
house
lucien
feeling
the
necessity
of
at
once
reporting
the
catastrophe
to
his
high
privy
councillor
nevertheless
was
afraid
of
compromising
himself
by
going
to
esther
s
house
where
he
might
find
company
he
actually
forgot
that
esther
was
here
so
confused
were
his
thoughts
and
in
the
midst
of
so
much
perplexity
he
was
obliged
to
make
small
talk
with
rastignac
who
knowing
nothing
of
the
news
congratulated
him
on
his
approaching
marriage
at
this
moment
nucingen
appeared
smiling
and
said
to
lucien
vill
you
do
me
de
pleasure
to
come
to
see
montame
de
champy
vat
vill
infite
you
herself
to
von
party
with
pleasure
baron
replied
lucien
to
whom
the
baron
appeared
as
a
rescuing
angel
leave
us
said
esther
to
monsieur
de
nucingen
when
she
saw
him
come
in
with
lucien
go
and
see
madame
du
whom
i
discover
in
a
box
on
the
third
tier
with
her
a
great
many
nabobs
grow
in
the
indies
she
added
with
a
knowing
glance
at
lucien
and
that
one
said
lucien
smiling
is
uncommonly
like
and
them
said
esther
answering
lucien
with
another
look
of
intelligence
while
still
speaking
to
the
baron
bring
her
here
with
her
nabob
he
is
very
anxious
to
make
your
acquaintance
they
say
he
is
very
rich
the
poor
woman
has
already
poured
out
i
know
not
how
many
elegies
she
complains
that
her
nabob
is
no
good
and
if
you
relieve
him
of
his
ballast
perhaps
he
will
sail
closer
to
the
you
tink
ve
are
all
tieves
said
the
baron
as
he
went
away
what
ails
you
my
lucien
asked
esther
in
her
friend
s
ear
just
touching
it
with
her
lips
as
soon
as
the
box
door
was
shut
i
am
lost
i
have
just
been
turned
from
the
door
of
the
hotel
de
grandlieu
under
pretence
that
no
one
was
admitted
the
duke
and
duchess
were
at
home
and
five
pairs
of
horses
were
champing
in
the
what
will
the
marriage
not
take
place
exclaimed
esther
much
agitated
for
she
saw
a
glimpse
of
paradise
i
do
not
yet
know
what
is
being
plotted
against
me
my
lucien
said
she
in
a
deliciously
coaxing
voice
why
be
worried
about
it
you
can
make
a
better
match
by
and
by
i
will
get
you
the
price
of
two
estates
give
us
supper
that
i
may
be
able
to
speak
in
secret
to
carlos
and
above
all
invite
the
sham
englishman
and
that
nabob
is
my
ruin
he
is
our
enemy
we
will
get
hold
of
him
and
we
but
lucien
broke
off
with
a
gesture
of
despair
well
what
is
it
asked
the
poor
girl
oh
madame
de
serizy
sees
me
cried
lucien
and
to
crown
our
woes
the
duc
de
rhetore
who
witnessed
my
dismissal
is
with
in
fact
at
that
very
minute
the
duc
de
rhetore
was
amusing
himself
with
madame
de
serizy
s
discomfiture
do
you
allow
lucien
to
be
seen
in
mademoiselle
esther
s
box
said
the
young
duke
pointing
to
the
box
and
to
lucien
you
who
take
an
interest
in
him
should
really
tell
him
such
things
are
not
allowed
he
may
sup
at
her
house
he
may
even
but
in
fact
i
am
no
longer
surprised
at
the
grandlieus
coolness
towards
the
young
man
i
have
just
seen
their
door
shut
in
his
face
on
the
front
steps
women
of
that
sort
are
very
dangerous
said
madame
de
serizy
turning
her
on
esther
s
box
yes
said
the
duke
as
much
by
what
they
can
do
as
by
what
they
wish
they
will
ruin
him
cried
madame
de
serizy
for
i
am
told
they
cost
as
much
whether
they
are
paid
or
not
to
him
said
the
young
duke
affecting
surprise
they
are
far
from
costing
him
anything
they
give
him
money
at
need
and
all
run
after
the
countess
lips
showed
a
little
nervous
twitching
which
could
not
be
included
in
any
category
of
smiles
well
then
said
esther
come
to
supper
at
midnight
bring
blondet
and
rastignac
let
us
have
two
amusing
persons
at
any
rate
and
we
won
t
be
more
than
you
must
find
some
excuse
for
sending
the
baron
to
fetch
eugenie
under
pretence
of
warning
asie
and
tell
her
what
has
befallen
me
so
that
carlos
may
know
before
he
has
the
nabob
under
his
that
shall
be
done
said
esther
and
thus
peyrade
was
probably
about
to
find
himself
unwittingly
under
the
same
roof
with
his
adversary
the
tiger
was
coming
into
the
lion
s
den
and
a
lion
surrounded
by
his
guards
when
lucien
went
back
to
madame
de
serizy
s
box
instead
of
turning
to
him
smiling
and
arranging
her
skirts
for
him
to
sit
by
her
she
affected
to
pay
him
not
the
slightest
attention
but
looked
about
the
house
through
her
glass
lucien
could
see
however
by
the
shaking
of
her
hand
that
the
countess
was
suffering
from
one
of
those
terrible
emotions
by
which
illicit
joys
are
paid
for
he
went
to
the
front
of
the
box
all
the
same
and
sat
down
by
her
at
the
opposite
corner
leaving
a
little
vacant
space
between
himself
and
the
countess
he
leaned
on
the
ledge
of
the
box
with
his
elbow
resting
his
chin
on
his
gloved
hand
then
he
half
turned
away
waiting
for
a
word
by
the
middle
of
the
act
the
countess
had
still
neither
spoken
to
him
nor
looked
at
him
i
do
not
know
said
she
at
last
why
you
are
here
your
place
is
in
mademoiselle
esther
s
box
i
will
go
there
said
lucien
leaving
the
box
without
looking
at
the
countess
my
dear
said
madame
du
going
into
esther
s
box
with
peyrade
whom
the
baron
de
nucingen
did
not
recognize
i
am
delighted
to
introduce
samuel
johnson
he
is
a
great
admirer
of
de
nucingen
s
indeed
monsieur
said
esther
smiling
at
peyrade
oh
yes
bocou
said
peyrade
why
baron
here
is
a
way
of
speaking
french
which
is
as
much
like
yours
as
the
low
breton
dialect
is
like
that
of
burgundy
it
will
be
most
amusing
to
hear
you
discuss
money
do
you
know
monsieur
nabob
what
i
shall
require
of
you
if
you
are
to
make
acquaintance
with
my
baron
said
esther
with
a
smile
oh
thank
you
so
much
you
will
introduce
me
to
sir
baronet
said
peyrade
with
an
extravagant
english
accent
yes
said
she
you
must
give
me
the
pleasure
of
your
company
at
supper
there
is
no
pitch
stronger
than
champagne
for
sticking
men
together
it
seals
every
kind
of
business
above
all
such
as
you
put
your
foot
come
this
evening
you
will
find
some
jolly
as
for
you
my
little
frederic
she
added
in
the
baron
s
ear
you
have
your
carriage
here
just
drive
to
the
rue
and
bring
europe
to
me
here
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
her
about
the
supper
i
have
caught
lucien
he
will
bring
two
men
who
will
be
we
will
draw
the
englishman
she
whispered
to
madame
du
peyrade
and
the
baron
left
the
women
together
oh
my
dear
if
you
ever
succeed
in
drawing
that
great
brute
you
will
be
clever
indeed
said
suzanne
if
it
proves
impossible
you
must
lend
him
to
me
for
a
week
replied
esther
laughing
you
would
but
keep
him
half
a
day
replied
madame
du
the
bread
i
eat
is
too
hard
it
breaks
my
teeth
never
again
to
my
dying
day
will
i
try
to
make
an
englishman
happy
they
are
all
cold
and
selfish
pigs
on
their
hind
what
no
consideration
said
esther
with
a
smile
on
the
contrary
my
dear
the
monster
has
never
shown
the
least
under
no
circumstances
whatever
asked
esther
the
wretch
always
addresses
me
as
madame
and
preserves
the
most
perfect
coolness
imaginable
at
moments
when
every
man
is
more
or
less
amenable
to
him
on
my
word
it
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
shaving
himself
he
wipes
the
razor
puts
it
back
in
its
case
and
looks
in
the
glass
as
if
he
were
saying
i
have
not
cut
myself
then
he
treats
me
with
such
respect
as
is
enough
to
send
a
woman
mad
that
odious
milord
potboiler
amuses
himself
by
making
poor
theodore
hide
in
my
and
stand
there
half
the
day
in
short
he
tries
to
annoy
me
in
every
way
and
as
stingy
as
miserly
as
gobseck
and
gigonnet
rolled
into
one
he
takes
me
out
to
dinner
but
he
does
not
pay
the
cab
that
brings
me
home
if
i
happen
not
to
have
ordered
my
carriage
to
fetch
well
said
esther
but
what
does
he
pay
you
for
your
services
oh
my
dear
positively
nothing
five
hundred
francs
a
month
and
not
a
penny
more
and
the
hire
of
a
carriage
but
what
is
it
a
machine
such
as
they
hire
out
for
a
wedding
to
carry
an
epicier
to
the
mairie
to
church
and
to
the
cadran
oh
he
nettles
me
with
his
respect
if
i
try
hysterics
and
feel
ill
he
is
never
vexed
he
only
says
i
wish
my
lady
to
have
her
own
way
for
there
is
nothing
more
detestable
no
gentleman
than
to
say
to
a
nice
woman
you
are
a
cotton
bale
a
bundle
of
ha
hah
are
you
a
member
of
the
temperance
society
and
and
my
horror
sits
pale
and
cold
and
hard
while
he
gives
me
to
understand
that
he
has
as
much
respect
for
me
as
he
might
have
for
a
negro
and
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
feelings
but
with
his
opinions
as
an
a
man
can
not
be
a
worse
wretch
said
esther
but
i
will
smash
up
that
outlandish
smash
him
up
replied
madame
du
not
if
he
does
not
love
me
you
yourself
would
you
like
to
ask
him
for
two
sous
he
would
listen
to
you
solemnly
and
tell
you
with
british
precision
that
would
make
a
slap
in
the
face
seem
genial
that
he
pays
dear
enough
for
the
trifle
that
love
can
be
to
his
poor
life
and
as
before
madame
du
mimicked
peyrade
s
bad
french
to
think
that
in
our
line
of
life
we
are
thrown
in
the
way
of
such
men
exclaimed
esther
oh
my
dear
you
have
been
uncommonly
lucky
take
good
care
of
your
but
your
nabob
must
have
got
some
idea
in
his
that
is
what
adele
look
here
my
dear
that
man
you
may
depend
has
laid
a
bet
that
he
will
make
a
woman
hate
him
and
pack
him
off
in
a
certain
or
else
he
wants
to
do
business
with
nucingen
and
took
me
up
knowing
that
you
and
i
were
friends
that
is
what
adele
thinks
answered
madame
du
that
is
why
i
introduced
him
to
you
this
evening
oh
if
only
i
could
be
sure
what
he
is
at
what
tricks
i
could
play
with
you
and
nucingen
and
you
don
t
get
angry
asked
esther
you
don
t
speak
your
mind
now
and
then
try
it
you
are
sharp
and
well
in
spite
of
your
sweetness
he
would
kill
you
with
his
icy
smiles
i
am
he
would
say
and
you
are
if
you
said
the
funniest
things
he
would
only
look
at
you
and
say
very
good
and
you
would
see
that
he
regards
you
merely
as
a
part
of
the
and
if
you
turned
furious
the
same
thing
it
would
still
be
a
show
you
might
cut
him
open
under
the
left
breast
without
hurting
him
in
the
least
his
internals
are
of
i
am
sure
i
told
him
so
he
replied
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
that
physical
and
always
polite
my
dear
he
wears
gloves
on
his
soul
i
shall
endure
this
martyrdom
for
a
few
days
longer
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
but
for
that
i
should
have
made
philippe
slap
my
lord
s
cheek
and
he
has
not
his
match
as
a
swordsman
there
is
nothing
else
left
for
it
i
was
just
going
to
say
so
cried
esther
but
you
must
ascertain
first
that
philippe
is
a
boxer
for
these
old
english
fellows
my
dear
have
a
depth
of
malignity
this
one
has
no
match
on
earth
no
if
you
could
but
see
him
asking
my
commands
to
know
at
what
hour
he
may
come
to
take
me
by
surprise
of
course
and
pouring
out
respectful
speeches
like
a
gentleman
you
would
say
why
he
adores
her
and
there
is
not
a
woman
in
the
world
who
would
not
say
the
and
they
envy
us
my
dear
exclaimed
esther
ah
well
sighed
madame
du
in
the
course
of
our
lives
we
learn
more
or
less
how
little
men
value
us
but
my
dear
i
have
never
been
so
cruelly
so
deeply
so
utterly
scorned
by
brutality
as
i
am
by
this
great
skinful
of
port
wine
when
he
is
tipsy
he
goes
away
not
to
be
unpleasant
as
he
tells
adele
and
not
to
be
under
two
powers
at
once
wine
and
woman
he
takes
advantage
of
my
carriage
he
uses
it
more
than
i
oh
if
only
we
could
see
him
under
the
table
but
he
can
drink
ten
bottles
and
only
be
fuddled
when
his
eyes
are
full
he
still
sees
like
people
whose
windows
are
dirty
outside
said
esther
but
who
can
see
from
inside
what
is
going
on
in
the
i
know
that
property
in
man
du
tillet
has
it
in
the
highest
try
to
get
du
tillet
and
if
he
and
nucingen
between
them
could
only
catch
him
in
some
of
their
plots
i
should
at
least
be
revenged
they
would
bring
him
to
beggary
oh
my
dear
to
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
hypocritical
protestant
after
that
poor
falleix
who
was
so
amusing
so
so
full
of
chaff
how
we
used
to
laugh
they
say
all
stockbrokers
are
stupid
well
he
for
one
never
lacked
wit
but
once
when
he
left
you
without
a
sou
that
is
what
made
you
acquainted
with
the
unpleasant
side
of
europe
brought
in
by
monsieur
de
nucingen
put
her
viperine
head
in
at
the
door
and
after
listening
to
a
few
words
whispered
in
her
ear
by
her
mistress
she
vanished
at
eleven
that
evening

carriages
were
stationed
in

all
their
magnificence
the
party
looked
forward
to
such
an
orgy
as
only
three
such
women
and
such
men
as
these
could
survive
they
began
by
playing
cards
as
they
had
to
wait
about
two
hours

down
to
a
florine
madame

round

chatting
lucien
spent
the
time
in
looking
through
a
book
of
fine
engravings
supper
is
ready
paccard
presently
announced
in
magnificent
livery
peyrade
was
placed
at
florine
s
left
hand
and
on
the
other
side
of
him
bixiou
whom
esther
had
enjoined
to
make
the
englishman
drink
freely
and
challenge
him
to
beat
him
bixiou
had
the
power
of
drinking
an
indefinite
quantity
never
in
his
life
had
peyrade
seen
such
splendor
or
tasted
of
such
cookery
or
seen
such
fine
women
i
am
getting
my
money
s
worth
this
evening
for
the
thousand
crowns
la
has
cost
me
till
now
thought
he
and
besides
i
have
just
won
a
thousand
this
is
an
example
for
men
to
follow
said
suzanne
who
was
sitting
by
lucien
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
at
the
splendors
of
the
esther
had
placed
lucien
next
herself
and
was
holding
his
foot
between
her
own
under
the
table
do
you
hear
said
madame
du
addressing
peyrade
who
affected
blindness
this
is
how
you
ought
to
furnish
a
house
when
a
man
brings
millions
home
from
india
and
wants
to
do
business
with
the
nucingens
he
should
place
himself
on
the
same
i
belong
to
a
temperance
society
then
you
will
drink
like
a
fish
said
bixiou
for
the
indies
are
uncommon
hot
uncle
it
was
bixiou
s
jest
during
supper
to
treat
peyrade
as
an
uncle
of
his
returned
from
india
montame
du
tolt
me
you
shall
have
some
iteas
said
nucingen
scrutinizing
peyrade
ah
this
is
what
i
wanted
to
hear
said
du
tillet
to
rastignac
the
two
talking
gibberish
you
will
see
they
will
understand
each
other
at
last
said
bixiou
guessing
what
du
tillet
had
said
to
rastignac
sir
baronet
i
have
imagined
a
speculation
oh
a
very
comfortable
job
bocou
profitable
and
rich
in
profits
now
you
will
see
said
blondet
to
du
tillet
he
will
not
talk
one
minute
without
dragging
in
the
parliament
and
the
english
it
is
in
china
in
the
opium
trade
ja
i
know
said
nucingen
at
once
as
a
man
who
is
well
acquainted
with
commercial
geography
but
de
english
gover
ment
hafe
taken
up
de
opium
trate
as
a
means
dat
shall
open
up
china
and
she
shall
not
allow
dat
ve
nucingen
has
cut
him
out
with
the
government
remarked
du
tillet
to
blondet
ah
you
have
been
in
the
opium
trade
cried
madame
du
now
i
understand
why
you
are
so
narcotic
some
has
stuck
in
your
dere
you
see
cried
the
baron
to
the
opium
merchant
and
pointing
to
madame
du
you
are
like
me
never
shall
a
millionaire
be
able
to
make
a
voman
lofe
i
have
loved
much
and
often
milady
replied
peyrade
as
a
result
of
temperance
said
bixiou
who
had
just
seen
peyrade
finish
his
third
bottle
of
claret
and
now
had
a
bottle
of
port
wine
uncorked
oh
cried
peyrade
it
is
very
fine
the
portugal
of
blondet
du
tillet
and
bixiou
smiled
at
each
other
peyrade
had
the
power
of
travestying
everything
even
his
wit
there
are
very
few
englishmen
who
will
not
maintain
that
gold
and
silver
are
better
in
england
than
elsewhere
the
fowls
and
eggs
exported
from
normandy
to
the
london
market
enable
the
english
to
maintain
that
the
poultry
and
eggs
in
london
are
superior
very
fine
to
those
of
paris
which
come
from
the
same
district
esther
and
lucien
were
dumfounded
by
this
perfection
of
costume
language
and
audacity
they
all
ate
and
drank
so
well
and
so
heartily
while
talking
and
laughing
that
it
went
on
till
four
in
the
morning
bixiou
flattered
himself
that
he
had
achieved
one
of
the
victories
so
pleasantly
related
by
but
at
the
moment
when
he
was
saying
to
himself
as
he
offered
his
uncle
some
more
wine
i
have
vanquished
england
peyrade
replied
in
good
french
to
this
malicious
scoffer
toujours
mon
garcon
go
it
my
boy
which
no
one
heard
but
bixiou
hallo
good
men
all
he
is
as
english
as
i
am
my
uncle
is
a
gascon
i
could
have
no
other
bixiou
and
peyrade
were
alone
so
no
one
heard
this
announcement
peyrade
rolled
off
his
chair
on
to
the
floor
paccard
forthwith
picked
him
up
and
carried
him
to
an
attic
where
he
fell
sound
asleep
at
six
o
clock
next
evening
the
nabob
was
roused
by
the
application
of
a
wet
cloth
with
which
his
face
was
being
washed
and
awoke
to
find
himself
on
a
face
to
face
with
asie
wearing
a
mask
and
a
black
domino
well
papa
peyrade
you
and
i
have
to
settle
accounts
said
she
where
am
i
asked
he
looking
about
him
listen
to
me
said
asie
and
that
will
sober
though
you
do
not
love
madame
du
you
love
your
daughter
i
suppose
my
daughter
peyrade
echoed
with
a
roar
yes
mademoiselle
what
then
what
then
she
is
no
longer
in
the
rue
des
moineaux
she
has
been
carried
peyrade
breathed
a
sigh
like
that
of
a
soldier
dying
of
a
mortal
wound
on
the
battlefield
while
you
were
pretending
to
be
an
englishman
some
one
else
was
pretending
to
be
peyrade
your
little
lydie
thought
she
was
with
her
father
and
she
is
now
in
a
safe
oh
you
will
never
find
her
unless
you
undo
the
mischief
you
have
what
mischief
yesterday
monsieur
lucien
de
rubempre
had
the
door
shut
in
his
face
at
the
duc
de
grandlieu
s
this
is
due
to
your
intrigues
and
to
the
man
you
let
loose
on
us
do
not
speak
listen
asie
went
on
seeing
peyrade
open
his
mouth
you
will
have
your
daughter
again
pure
and
spotless
she
added
emphasizing
her
statement
by
the
accent
on
every
word
only
on
the
day
after
that
on
which
monsieur
lucien
de
rubempre
walks
out
of
d
aquin
as
the
husband
of
mademoiselle
clotilde
if
within
ten
days

de
rubempre
is
not
admitted
as
he

the
grandlieus
house
you
to
begin
with
will
die
a
violent
death
and
nothing
can
save
you
from
the
fate
that
threatens
then
when
you
feel
yourself
dying
you
will
have
time
before
breathing
your
last
to
reflect
my
daughter
is
a
prostitute
for
the
rest
of
her
life
though
you
have
been
such
a
fool
as
give
us
this
hold
for
our
clutches
you
still
have
sense
enough
to
meditate
on
this
ultimatum
from
our
government
do
not
bark

to
any
one

to
contenson
s
and

your

little
lydie

begin
where

promised
to

marsay

mince
matters

heh
go
on
downstairs
and
take
care
not
to
meddle
in
our
concerns
any
asie
left
peyrade
in
a
pitiable
state
every
word
had
been
a
blow
with
a
club
the
spy
had
tears
in
his
eyes
and
tears
hanging
from
his
cheeks
at
the
end
of
a
wet
furrow
they
are
waiting
dinner
for
johnson
said
europe
putting
her
head
in
a
moment
after
peyrade
made
no
reply
he
went
down
walked
till
he
reached
a
and
hurried
off
to
undress
at
contenson
s
not
saying
a
word
to
him
he
resumed
the
costume
of
pere
canquoelle
and
got
home
by
eight
o
clock
he
mounted
the
stairs
with
a
beating
heart
when
the
flemish
woman
heard
her
master
she
asked
him
well
and
where
is
mademoiselle
with
such
simplicity
that
the
old
spy
was
obliged
to
lean
against
the
wall
the
blow
was
more
than
he
could
bear
he
went
into
his
daughter
s
rooms
and
ended
by
fainting
with
grief
when
he
found
them
empty
and
heard
katt
s
story
which
was
that
of
an
abduction
as
skilfully
planned
as
if
he
had
arranged
it
himself
well
well
thought

i
must
knock

first
time

oh
that
spanish
priest
is
a
knowing
one
courage
friend
peyrade
disgorge
your
prey
the
poor
father
never
dreamed
of
the
fearful
blow
that
awaited
him
on
reaching
corentin
s
house
bruno
the
confidential
servant
who
knew
peyrade
said
monsieur
is
gone
for
a
long
time
for
ten
where
i
don
t
know
good
god
i
am
losing
my
wits
i
ask
him
where
as
if
we
ever
told
them
thought
he
a
few
hours
before
the
moment
when
peyrade
was
to
be
roused
in
his
garret
in
the
rue
corentin
coming
in
from
his
country
place
at
passy
had
made
his
way
to
the
duc
de
grandlieu
s
in
the
costume
of
a
retainer
of
a
superior
class
he
wore
the
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
at
his
he
had
made
up
a
withered
old
face
with
powdered
hair
deep
wrinkles
and
a
colorless
skin
his
eyes
were
hidden
by
spectacles
he
looked
like
a
retired
on
giving
his
name
as
monsieur
de
he
was
led
to
the
duke
s
private
room
where
he
found
derville
reading
a
letter
which
he
himself
had
dictated
to
one
of
his
agents
the
number
whose
business
it
was
to
write
documents
the
duke
took
corentin
aside
to
tell
him
all
he
already
knew
monsieur
de
listened
coldly
and
respectfully
amusing
himself
by
studying
this
grand
gentleman
by
penetrating
the
tufa
beneath
the
velvet
cover
by
scrutinizing
this
being
now
and
always
absorbed
in
whist
and
in
regard
for
the
house
of
grandlieu
if
you
will
take
my
advice
monsieur
said
corentin
to
derville
after
being
duly
introduced
to
the
lawyer
we
shall
set
out
this
very
afternoon
for
angouleme
by
the
bordeaux
coach
which
goes
quite
as
fast
as
the
mail
and
we
shall
not
need
to
stay
there
six
hours
to
obtain
the
information
monsieur
le
duc
requires
it
will
be
enough
if
i
have
understood
your
grace
to
ascertain
whether
monsieur
de
rubempre
s
sister
and
are
in
a
position
to
give
him
twelve
hundred
thousand
francs
and
he
turned
to
the
duke
you
have
understood
me
perfectly
said
the
duke
we
can
be
back
again
in
four
days
corentin
went
on
addressing
derville
and
neither
of
us
will
have
neglected
his
business
long
enough
for
it
to
that
was
the
only
difficulty
i
was
about
to
mention
to
his
grace
said
derville
it
is
now
four
o
clock
i
am
going
home
to
say
a
word
to
my
and
pack
my
and
after
dinner
at
eight
o
clock
i
will
be
but
shall
we
get
places
he
said
to
monsieur
de
interrupting
himself
i
will
answer
for
that
said
corentin
be
in
the
yard
of
the
chief
office
of
the
messageries
at
eight
o
clock
if
there
are
no
places
they
shall
make
some
for
that
is
the
way
to
serve
monseigneur
le
duc
de
gentlemen
said
the
duke
most
graciously
i
postpone
my
thanks
corentin
and
the
lawyer
taking
this
as
a
dismissal
bowed
and
withdrew
at
the
hour
when
peyrade
was
questioning
corentin
s
servant
monsieur
de
and
derville
seated
in
the
bordeaux
coach
were
studying
each
other
in
silence
as
they
drove
out
of
paris
next
morning
between
orleans
and
tours
derville
being
bored
began
to
converse
and
corentin
condescended
to
amuse
him
but
keeping
his
distance
he
left
him
to
believe
that
he
was
in
the
diplomatic
service
and
was
hoping
to
become
by
the
good
offices
of
the
duc
de
grandlieu
two
days
after
leaving
paris
corentin
and
derville
got
out
at
mansle
to
the
great
surprise
of
the
lawyer
who
thought
he
was
going
to
angouleme
in
this
little
town
said
corentin
we
can
get
the
most
positive
information
as
regards
madame
do
you
know
her
then
asked
derville
astonished
to
find
corentin
so
well
informed
i
made
the
conductor
talk
finding
he
was
a
native
of
angouleme
he
tells
me
that
madame
sechard
lives
at
marsac
and
marsac
is
but
a
league
away
from
mansle
i
thought
we
should
be
at
greater
advantage
here
than
at
angouleme
for
verifying
the
and
besides
thought
derville
as
monsieur
le
duc
said
i
act
merely
as
the
witness
to
the
inquiries
made
by
this
confidential
agent
the
inn
at
mansle
belle
had
for
its
landlord
one
of
those
fat
and
burly
men
whom
we
fear
we
may
find
no
more
on
our
return
but
who
still
ten
years
after
are
seen
standing
at
their
door
with
as
much
superfluous
flesh
as
ever
in
the
same
linen
cap
the
same
apron
with
the
same
knife
the
same
oiled
hair
the
same
triple
chin
all
stereotyped
by
from
the
immortal
cervantes
to
the
immortal
walter
scott
are
they
not
all
boastful
of
their
cookery
have
they
not
all
whatever
you
please
to
order
and
do
not
all
end
by
giving
you
the
same
hectic
chicken
and
vegetables
cooked
with
rank
butter
they
all
boast
of
their
fine
wines
and
all
make
you
drink
the
wine
of
the
country
but
corentin
from
his
earliest
youth
had
known
the
art
of
getting
out
of
an
innkeeper
things
more
essential
to
himself
than
doubtful
dishes
and
apocryphal
wines
so
he
gave
himself
out
as
a
man
easy
to
please
and
willing
to
leave
himself
in
the
hands
of
the
best
cook
in
mansle
as
he
told
the
fat
man
there
is
no
difficulty
about
being
the
best
i
am
the
only
one
said
the
host
serve
us
in
the
side
room
said
corentin
winking
at
derville
and
do
not
be
afraid
of
setting
the
chimney
on
fire
we
want
to
thaw
out
the
frost
in
our
it
was
not
warm
in
the
coach
said
derville
is
it
far
to
marsac
asked
corentin
of
the
innkeeper
s
wife
who
came
down
from
the
upper
regions
on
hearing
that
the
diligence
had
dropped
two
travelers
to
sleep
there
are
you
going
to
marsac
monsieur
replied
the
woman
i
don
t
know
he
said
sharply
is
it
far
from
hence
to
marsac
he
repeated
after
giving
the
woman
time
to
notice
his
red
ribbon
in
a
chaise
a
matter
of
half
an
hour
said
the
innkeeper
s
wife
do
you
think
that
monsieur
and
madame
sechard
are
likely
to
be
there
in
winter
to
be
sure
they
live
there
all
the
year
it
is
now
five
o
clock
we
shall
still
find
them
up
at
oh
yes
till
ten
they
have
company
every
evening
the
cure
monsieur
marron
the
doctor
good
folks
then
said
derville
oh
the
best
of
good
souls
replied
the
woman
honest
and
not
ambitious
neither
monsieur
sechard
though
he
is
very
well
off
they
say
he
might
have
made
millions
if
he
had
not
allowed
himself
to
be
robbed
of
an
invention
in
the
of
which
the
brothers
cointet
are
getting
the
benefit
ah
to
be
sure
the
brothers
cointet
said
corentin
hold
your
tongue
said
the
innkeeper
what
can
it
matter
to
these
gentlemen
whether
monsieur
sechard
has
a
right
or
no
to
a
patent
for
his
inventions
in
if
you
mean
to
spend
the
night
here
at
the
he
went
on
addressing
the
travelers
here
is
the
book
and
please
to
put
your
names
down
we
have
an
officer
in
this
town
who
has
nothing
to
do
and
spends
all
his
time
in
nagging
at
us
the
devil
said
corentin
while
derville
entered
their
names
and
his
profession
as
attorney
to
the
lower
court
in
the
department
of
the
seine
i
fancied
the
sechards
were
very
some
people
say
they
are
millionaires
replied
the
innkeeper
but
as
to
hindering
tongues
from
wagging
you
might
as
well
try
to
stop
the
river
from
flowing
old
sechard
left
two
hundred
thousand
francs
worth
of
landed
property
it
is
said
and
that
is
not
amiss
for
a
man
who
began
as
a
workman
well
and
he
may
have
had
as
much
again
in
savings
for
he
made
ten
or
twelve
thousand
francs
out
of
his
land
at
last
so
supposing
he
were
fool
enough
not
to
invest
his
money
for
ten
years
that
would
be
all
told
but
even
if
he
lent
it
at
high
interest
as
he
is
suspected
of
doing
there
would
be
three
hundred
thousand
francs
perhaps
and
that
is
all
five
hundred
thousand
francs
is
a
long
way
short
of
a
million
i
should
be
quite
content
with
the
difference
and
no
more
of
the
for
me
really
said
corentin
then
monsieur
david
sechard
and
his
wife
have
not
a
fortune
of
two
or
three
millions
why
exclaimed
the
innkeeper
s
wife
that
is
what
the
cointets
are
supposed
to
have
who
robbed
him
of
his
invention
and
he
does
not
get
more
than
twenty
thousand
francs
out
of
them
where
do
you
suppose
such
honest
folks
would
find
millions
they
were
very
much
pinched
while
the
father
was
alive
but
for
kolb
their
manager
and
madame
kolb
who
is
as
much
attached
to
them
as
her
husband
they
could
scarcely
have
lived
why
how
much
had
they
with
la
verberie
a
thousand
francs
a
year
corentin
drew
derville
aside
and
said
in
vino
veritas
truth
lives
under
a
cork
for
my
part
i
regard
an
inn
as
the
real
registry
office
of
the
countryside
the
notary
is
not
better
informed
than
the
innkeeper
as
to
all
that
goes
on
in
a
small
you
see
we
are
supposed
to
know
all
about
the
cointets
and
kolb
and
the
rest
your
innkeeper
is
the
living
record
of
every
incident
he
does
the
work
of
the
police
without
suspecting
it
a
government
should
maintain
two
hundred
spies
at
most
for
in
a
country
like
france
there
are
ten
millions
of
however
we
need
not
trust
to
this
report
though
even
in
this
little
town
something
would
be
known
about
the
twelve
hundred
thousand
francs
sunk
in
paying
for
the
rubempre
estate
we
will
not
stop
here
long
i
hope
not
derville
put
in
and
this
is
why
added
corentin
i
have
hit
on
the
most
natural
way
of
extracting
the
truth
from
the
mouth
of
the
sechard
couple
i
rely
upon
you
to
support
by
your
authority
as
a
lawyer
the
little
trick
i
shall
employ
to
enable
you
to
hear
a
clear
and
complete
account
of
their
after
dinner
we
shall
set
out
to
call
on
monsieur
sechard
said
corentin
to
the
innkeeper
s
wife
have
beds
ready
for
us
we
want
separate
rooms
there
can
be
no
difficulty
under
the
oh
monsieur
said
the
woman
we
invented
the
the
pun
is
to
be
found
in
every
department
said
corentin
it
is
no
monopoly
of
dinner
is
served
gentlemen
said
the
innkeeper
but
where
the
devil
can
that
young
fellow
have
found
the
money
is
the
anonymous
writer
accurate
can
it
be
the
earnings
of
some
handsome
baggage
said
derville
as
they
sat
down
to
dinner
ah
that
will
be
the
subject
of
another
inquiry
said
corentin
lucien
de
rubempre
as
the
duc
de
chaulieu
tells
me
lives
with
a
converted
jewess
who
passes
for
a
dutch
woman
and
is
called
esther
van
what
a
strange
coincidence
said
the
lawyer
i
am
hunting
for
the
heiress
of
a
dutchman
named
gobseck
it
is
the
same
name
with
a
transposition
of
well
said
corentin
you
shall
have
information
as
to
her
parentage
on
my
return
to
an
hour
later
the
two
agents
for
the
grandlieu
family
set
out
for
la
verberie
where
monsieur
and
madame
sechard
were
living
never
had
lucien
felt
any
emotion
so
deep
as
that
which
overcame
him
at
la
verberie
when
comparing
his
own
fate
with
that
of
his
the
two
parisians
were
about
to
witness
the
same
scene
that
had
so
much
struck
lucien
a
few
days
since
everything
spoke
of
peace
and
abundance
at
the
hour
when
the
two
strangers
were
arriving
a
party
of
four
persons
were
being
entertained
in
the
of
la
verberie
the
cure
of
marsac
a
young
priest
of
who
at
madame
sechard
s
request
had
become
tutor
to
her
little
boy
lucien
the
country
doctor
monsieur
marron
the
maire
of
the
commune
and
an
old
colonel
who
grew
roses
on
a
plot
of
land
opposite
to
la
verberie
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
every
evening
during
the
winter
these
persons
came
to
play
an
artless
game
of
boston
for
centime
points
to
borrow
the
papers
or
return
those
they
had
finished
when
monsieur
and
madame
sechard
had
bought
la
verberie
a
fine
house
built
of
stone
and
roofed
with
slate
the
consisted
of
a
garden
of
two
acres
in
the
course
of
time
by
devoting
her
savings
to
the
purpose
handsome
madame
sechard
had
extended
her
garden
as
far
as
a
brook
by
cutting
down
the
vines
on
some
ground
she
purchased
and
replacing
them
with
grass
plots
and
clumps
of
shrubbery
at
the
present
time
the
house
surrounded
by
a
park
of
about
twenty
acres
and
enclosed
by
walls
was
considered
the
most
imposing
place
in
the
neighborhood
old
sechard
s
former
residence
with
the
outhouses
attached
was
now
used
as
the
for
the
manager
of
about
twenty
acres
of
vineyard
left
by
him
of
five
farmsteads
bringing
in
about
six
thousand
francs
a
year
and
ten
acres
of
meadow
land
lying
on
the
further
side
of
the
stream
exactly
opposite
the
little
park
indeed
madame
sechard
hoped
to
include
them
in
it
the
next
year
la
verberie
was
already
spoken
of
in
the
neighborhood
as
a
chateau
and
eve
sechard
was
known
as
the
lady
of
marsac
lucien
while
flattering
her
vanity
had
only
followed
the
example
of
the
peasants
and
courtois
the
owner
of
the
mill
very
picturesquely
situated
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
meadows
of
la
verberie
was
in
treaty
it
was
said
with
madame
sechard
for
the
sale
of
his
property
and
this
acquisition
would
give
the
finishing
touch
to
the
estate
and
the
rank
of
a
place
in
the
department
madame
sechard
who
did
a
great
deal
of
good
with
as
much
judgment
as
generosity
was
equally
esteemed
and
loved
her
beauty
now
really
splendid
was
at
the
height
of
its
bloom
she
was
about
but
had
preserved
all
the
freshness
of
youth
from
living
in
the
tranquillity
and
abundance
of
a
country
life
still
much
in
love
with
her
husband
she
respected
him
as
a
clever
man
who
was
modest
enough
to
renounce
the
display
of
fame
in
short
to
complete
her
portrait
it
is
enough
to
say
that
in
her
whole
existence
she
had
never
felt
a
throb
of
her
heart
that
was
not
inspired
by
her
husband
or
her
children
the
tax
paid
to
grief
by
this
happy
household
was
as
may
be
supposed
the
deep
anxiety
caused
by
lucien
s
career
in
which
eve
sechard
suspected
mysteries
which
she
dreaded
all
the
more
because
during
his
last
visit
lucien
roughly
cut
short
all
his
sister
s
questions
by
saying
that
an
ambitious
man
owed
no
account
of
his
proceedings
to
any
one
but
himself
in
six
years
lucien
had
seen
his
sister
but
three
times
and
had
not
written
her
more
than
six
letters
his
first
visit
to
la
verberie
had
been
on
the
occasion
of
his
mother
s
death
and
his
last
had
been
paid
with
a
view
to
asking
the
favor
of
the
lie
which
was
so
necessary
to
his
advancement
this
gave
rise
to
a
very
serious
scene
between
monsieur
and
madame
sechard
and
their
brother
and
left
their
happy
and
respected
life
troubled
by
the
most
terrible
suspicions
the
interior
of
the
house
as
much
altered
as
the
surroundings
was
comfortable
without
luxury
as
will
be
understood
by
a
glance
round
the
room
where
the
little
party
were
now
assembled
a
pretty
aubusson
carpet
hangings
of
gray
cotton
twill
bound
with
green
silk
brocade
the
woodwork
painted
to
imitate
spa
wood
carved
mahogany
furniture
covered
with
gray
woolen
stuff
and
green
gimp
with
gay
with
flowers
in
spite
of
the
time
of
year
presented
a
very
pleasing
and
homelike
aspect
the
window
curtains
of
green
brocade
the
chimney
ornaments
and
the
mirror
frames
were
untainted
by
the
bad
taste
that
spoils
everything
in
the
provinces
and
the
smallest
details
all
elegant
and
appropriate
gave
the
mind
and
eye
a
sense
of
repose
and
of
poetry
which
a
clever
and
loving
woman
can
and
ought
to
infuse
into
her
home
madame
sechard
still
in
mourning
for
her
father
sat
by
the
fire
working
at
some
large
piece
of
tapestry
with
the
help
of
madame
kolb
the
housekeeper
to
whom
she
intrusted
all
the
minor
cares
of
the
household
a
chaise
has
stopped
at
the
door
said
courtois
hearing
the
sound
of
wheels
outside
and
to
judge
by
the
clatter
of
metal
it
belongs
to
these
parts
postel
and
his
wife
have
come
to
see
us
no
doubt
said
the
doctor
no
said
courtois
the
chaise
has
come
from
montame
said
kolb
the
burly
alsatian
we
have
made
acquaintance
with
in
a
former
volume
here
is
a
lawyer
from
paris
who
wants
to
speak
with
a
lawyer
cried
sechard
the
very
word
gives
me
the
colic
thank
you
said
the
maire
of
marsac
named
cachan
who
for
twenty
years
had
been
an
attorney
at
angouleme
and
who
had
once
been
required
to
prosecute
sechard
my
poor
david
will
never
improve
he
will
always
be
said
eve
smiling
a
lawyer
from
paris
said
courtois
have
you
any
business
in
paris
no
said
eve
but
you
have
a
brother
there
observed
courtois
take
care
lest
he
should
have
anything
to
say
about
old
sechard
s
estate
said
cachan
had
his
finger
in
some
very
queer
concerns
worthy
man
corentin
and
derville
on
entering
the
room
after
bowing
to
the
company
and
giving
their
names
begged
to
have
a
private
interview
with
monsieur
and
madame
sechard
by
all
means
said
sechard
but
is
it
a
matter
of
business
solely
a
matter
regarding
your
father
s
property
said
corentin
then
i
beg
you
will
allow
monsieur
the
maire
a
lawyer
formerly
at
angouleme
to
be
present
are
you
monsieur
derville
said
cachan
addressing
corentin
no
monsieur
this
is
monsieur
derville
replied
corentin
introducing
the
lawyer
who
bowed
but
said
sechard
we
are
so
to
speak
a
family
party
we
have
no
secrets
from
our
neighbors
there
is
no
need
to
retire
to
my
study
where
there
is
no
fire
our
life
is
in
the
sight
of
all
men
but
your
father
s
said
corentin
was
involved
in
certain
mysteries
which
perhaps
you
would
rather
not
make
is
it
anything
we
need
blush
for
said
eve
in
alarm
oh
no
a
sin
of
his
youth
said
corentin
coldly
setting
one
of
his
monsieur
your
father
left
an
elder
son
oh
the
old
rascal
cried
courtois
he
was
never
very
fond
of
you
monsieur
sechard
and
he
kept
that
secret
from
you
the
deep
old
dog
now
i
understand
what
he
meant
when
he
used
to
say
to
me
you
shall
see
what
you
shall
see
when
i
am
under
the
do
not
be
dismayed
monsieur
said
corentin
to
sechard
while
he
watched
eve
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
a
brother
exclaimed
the
doctor
then
your
inheritance
is
divided
into
two
derville
was
affecting
to
examine
the
fine
engravings
proofs
before
letters
which
hung
on
the
walls
do
not
be
dismayed
madame
corentin
went
on
seeing
amazement
written
on
madame
sechard
s
handsome
features
it
is
only
a
natural
son
the
rights
of
a
natural
son
are
not
the
same
as
those
of
a
legitimate
child
this
man
is
in
the
depths
of
poverty
and
he
has
a
right
to
a
certain
sum
calculated
on
the
amount
of
the
estate
the
millions
left
by
your
father
at
the
word
millions
there
was
a
perfectly
unanimous
cry
from
all
the
persons
present
and
now
derville
ceased
to
study
the
prints
old
sechard
millions
said
courtois
who
on
earth
told
you
that
some
peasant
monsieur
said
cachan
you
are
not
attached
to
the
treasury
you
may
be
told
all
the
facts
be
quite
easy
said
corentin
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
i
am
not
employed
by
the
cachan
who
had
just
signed
to
everybody
to
say
nothing
gave
expression
to
his
satisfaction
monsieur
corentin
went
on
if
the
whole
estate
were
but
a
million
a
natural
child
s
share
would
still
be
something
considerable
but
we
have
not
come
to
threaten
a
lawsuit
on
the
contrary
our
purpose
is
to
propose
that
you
should
hand
over
one
hundred
thousand
francs
and
we
will
depart
one
hundred
thousand
francs
cried
cachan
interrupting
him
but
monsieur
old
sechard
left
twenty
acres
of
vineyard
five
small
farms
ten
acres
of
meadowland
here
and
not
a
sou
besides
nothing
on
earth
cried
david
sechard
would
induce
me
to
tell
a
lie
and
less
to
a
question
of
money
than
on
any
monsieur
he
said
turning
to
corentin
and
derville
my
father
left
us
besides
the
land
courtois
and
cachan
signaled
in
vain
to
sechard
he
went
on
three
hundred
thousand
francs
which
raises
the
whole
estate
to
about
five
hundred
thousand
monsieur
cachan
asked
eve
sechard
what
proportion
does
the
law
allot
to
a
natural
child
madame
said
corentin
we
are
not
turks
we
only
require
you
to
swear
before
these
gentlemen
that
you
did
not
inherit
more
than
five
hundred
thousand
francs
from
your
and
we
can
come
to
an
first
give
me
your
word
of
honor
that
you
really
are
a
lawyer
said
cachan
to
derville
here
is
my
passport
replied
derville
handing
him
a
paper
folded
in
four
and
monsieur
is
not
as
you
might
suppose
an
inspector
from
the
treasury
so
be
easy
he
added
we
had
an
important
reason
for
wanting
to
know
the
truth
as
to
the
sechard
estate
and
we
now
know
derville
took
madame
sechard
s
hand
and
led
her
very
courteously
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
madame
said
he
in
a
low
voice
if
it
were
not
that
the
honor
and
future
prospects
of
the
house
of
grandlieu
are
implicated
in
this
affair
i
would
never
have
lent
myself
to
the
stratagem
devised
by
this
gentleman
of
the
red
ribbon
but
you
must
forgive
him
it
was
necessary
to
detect
the
falsehood
by
means
of
which
your
brother
has
stolen
a
march
on
the
beliefs
of
that
ancient
family
beware
now
of
allowing
it
to
be
supposed
that
you
have
given
your
brother
twelve
hundred
thousand
francs
to
repurchase
the
rubempre
estates
twelve
hundred
thousand
francs
cried
madame
sechard
turning
pale
where
did
he
get
them
wretched
boy
ah
that
is
the
question
replied
derville
i
fear
that
the
source
of
his
wealth
is
far
from
the
tears
rose
to
eve
s
eyes
as
her
neighbors
could
see
we
have
perhaps
done
you
a
great
service
by
saving
you
from
abetting
a
falsehood
of
which
the
results
may
be
positively
dangerous
the
lawyer
went
on
derville
left
madame
sechard
sitting
pale
and
dejected
with
tears
on
her
cheeks
and
bowed
to
the
company
to
mansle
said
corentin
to
the
little
boy
who
drove
the
chaise
there
was
but
one
vacant
place
in
the
diligence
from
bordeaux
to
paris
derville
begged
corentin
to
allow
him
to
take
it
urging
a
press
of
business
but
in
his
soul
he
was
distrustful
of
his
traveling
companion
whose
diplomatic
dexterity
and
coolness
struck
him
as
being
the
result
of
practice
corentin
remained
three
days
longer
at
mansle
unable
to
get
away
he
was
obliged
to
secure
a
place
in
the
paris
coach
by
writing
to
bordeaux
and
did
not
get
back
till
nine
days
after
leaving
home
peyrade
meanwhile
had
called
every
morning
either
at
passy
or
in
paris
to
inquire
whether
corentin
had
returned
on
the
eighth
day
he
left
at
each
house
a
note
written
in
their
peculiar
cipher
to
explain
to
his
friend
what
death
hung
over
him
and
to
tell
him
of
lydie
s
abduction
and
the
horrible
end
to
which
his
enemies
had
devoted
them
peyrade
bereft
of
corentin
but
seconded
by
contenson
still
kept
up
his
disguise
as
a
nabob
even
though
his
invisible
foes
had
discovered
him
he
very
wisely
reflected
that
he
might
glean
some
light
on
the
matter
by
remaining
on
the
field
of
the
contest
contenson
had
brought
all
his
experience
into
play
in
his
search
for
lydie
and
hoped
to
discover
in
what
house
she
was
hidden
but
as
the
days
went
by
the
impossibility
absolutely
demonstrated
of
tracing
the
slightest
clue
added
hour
by
hour
to
peyrade
s
despair
the
old
spy
had
a
sort
of
guard
about
him
of
twelve
or
fifteen
of
the
most
experienced
detectives
they
watched
the
neighborhood
of
the
rue
des
moineaux
and
the
rue
taitbout
where
he
lived
as
a
nabob
with
madame
du
during
the
last
three
days
of
the
term
granted
by
asie
to
reinstate
lucien
on
his
old
footing
in
the
hotel
de
grandlieu
contenson
never
left
the
veteran
of
the
old
general
police
office
and
the
poetic
terror
shed
throughout
the
forests
of
america
by
the
arts
of
inimical
and
warring
tribes
of
which
cooper
made
such
good
use
in
his
novels
was
here
associated
with
the
petty
details
of
paris
life
the
the
shops
the
hackney
cabs
a
figure
standing
at
a
window
everything
had
to
the
human
ciphers
to
whom
old
peyrade
had
intrusted
his
safety
the
thrilling
interest
which
attaches
in
cooper
s
romances
to
a
a
rock
a
a
floating
canoe
a
weed
straggling
over
the
water
if
the
spaniard
has
gone
away
you
have
nothing
to
fear
said
contenson
to
peyrade
remarking
on
the
perfect
peace
they
lived
in
but
if
he
is
not
gone
observed
peyrade
he
took
one
of
my
men
at
the
back
of
the
chaise
but
at
blois
my
man
having
to
get
down
could
not
catch
the
chaise
up
five
days
after
derville
s
return
lucien
one
morning
had
a
call
from
rastignac
i
am
in
despair
my
dear
boy
said
his
visitor
at
finding
myself
compelled
to
deliver
a
message
which
is
intrusted
to
me
because
we
are
known
to
be
intimate
your
marriage
is
broken
off
beyond
all
hope
of
reconciliation
never
set
foot
again
in
the
hotel
de
grandlieu
to
marry
clotilde
you
must
wait
till
her
father
dies
and
he
is
too
selfish
to
die
yet
awhile
old
sit
at
table
the
very
late
clotilde
is
setting
out
for
italy
with
madeleine
de
the
poor
girl
is
so
madly
in
love
with
you
my
dear
fellow
that
they
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
her
she
was
bent
on
coming
to
see
you
and
had
plotted
an
escape
that
may
comfort
you
in
misfortune
lucien
made
no
reply
he
sat
gazing
at
rastignac
and
is
it
a
misfortune
after
all
his
friend
went
on
you
will
easily
find
a
girl
as
well
born
and
better
looking
than
clotilde
madame
de
serizy
will
find
you
a
wife
out
of
spite
she
can
not
endure
the
grandlieus
who
never
would
have
anything
to
say
to
her
she
has
a
niece
little
clemence
du
rouvre
my
dear
boy
said
lucien
at
length
since
that
supper
i
am
not
on
terms
with
madame
de
serizy
she
saw
me
in
esther
s
box
and
made
a
scene
and
i
left
her
to
a
woman
of
forty
does
not
long
keep
up
a
quarrel
with
so
handsome
a
man
as
you
are
said
rastignac
i
know
something
of
these
it
lasts
ten
minutes
in
the
sky
and
ten
years
in
a
woman
s
i
have
waited
a
week
to
hear
from
go
and
yes
i
must
are
you
coming
at
any
rate
to
the
s
her
nabob
is
returning
the
supper
given
by
i
am
asked
and
i
shall
go
said
lucien
gravely
the
day
after
this
confirmation
of
his
disaster
which
carlos
heard
of
at
once
from
asie
lucien
went
to
the
rue
taitbout
with
rastignac
and
nucingen
at
midnight
nearly
all
the
personages
of
this
drama
were
assembled
in
the
that
had
formerly
been
esther
s
a
drama
of
which
the
interest
lay
hidden
under
the
very
bed
of
these
tumultuous
lives
and
was
known
only
to
esther
to
lucien
to
peyrade
to
contenson
the
mulatto
and
to
paccard
who
attended
his
mistress
asie
without
its
being
known
to
contenson
and
peyrade
had
been
asked
by
madame
du
to
come
and
help
her
cook
as
they
sat
down
to
table
peyrade
who
had
given
madame
du
five
hundred
francs
that
the
thing
might
be
well
done
found
under
his
napkin
a
scrap
of
paper
on
which
these
words
were
written
in
pencil
the
ten
days
are
up
at
the
moment
when
you
sit
down
to
peyrade
handed
the
paper
to
contenson
who
was
standing
behind
him
saying
in
english
did
you
put
my
name
here
contenson
read
by
the
light
of
the
this
mene
tekel
upharsin
and
slipped
the
scrap
into
his
pocket
but
he
knew
how
difficult
it
is
to
verify
a
handwriting
in
pencil
and
above
all
a
sentence
written
in
roman
capitals
that
is
to
say
with
mathematical
lines
since
capital
letters
are
wholly
made
up
of
straight
lines
and
curves
in
which
it
is
impossible
to
detect
any
trick
of
the
hand
as
in
what
is
called
the
supper
was
absolutely
devoid
of
spirit
peyrade
was
visibly
of
the
men
about
town
who
give
life
to
a
supper
only
rastignac
and
lucien
were
present
lucien
was
gloomy
and
absorbed
in
thought
rastignac
who
had
lost
two
thousand
francs
before
supper
ate
and
drank
with
the
hope
of
recovering
them
later
the
three
women
stricken
by
this
chill
looked
at
each
other
dulness
deprived
the
dishes
of
all
relish
suppers
like
plays
and
books
have
their
good
and
bad
luck
at
the
end
of
the
meal
ices
were
served
of
the
kind
called
plombieres
as
everybody
knows
this
kind
of
dessert
has
delicate
preserved
fruits
laid
on
the
top
of
the
ice
which
is
served
in
a
little
glass
not
heaped
above
the
rim
these
ices
had
been
ordered
by
madame
du
of
tortoni
whose
shop
is
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
taitbout
and
the
boulevard
the
cook
called
contenson
out
of
the
room
to
pay
the
bill
contenson
who
thought
this
demand
on
the
part
of
the
rather
strange
went
downstairs
and
startled
him
by
saying
then
you
have
not
come
from
tortoni
s
and
then
went
straight
upstairs
again
paccard
had
meanwhile
handed
the
ices
to
the
company
in
his
absence
the
mulatto
had
hardly
reached
the
door
when
one
of
the
police
constables
who
had
kept
watch
in
the
rue
des
moineaux
called
up
the
stairs
number
what
s
up
replied
contenson
flying
down
again
tell
papa
that
his
daughter
has
come
home
but
good
god
in
what
a
state
tell
him
to
come
at
once
she
is
at
the
moment
when
contenson
the
old
peyrade
who
had
drunk
a
great
deal
was
swallowing
the
cherry
off
his
ice
they
were
drinking
to
the
health
of
madame
du
the
nabob
filled
his
glass
with
constantia
and
emptied
it
in
spite
of
his
distress
at
the
news
he
had
to
give
peyrade
contenson
was
struck
by
the
eager
attention
with
which
paccard
was
looking
at
the
nabob
his
eyes
sparkled
like
two
fixed
flames
although
it
seemed
important
still
this
could
not
delay
the
mulatto
who
leaned
over
his
master
just
as
peyrade
set
his
glass
down
lydie
is
at
home
said
contenson
in
a
very
bad
peyrade
rattled
out
the
most
french
of
all
french
oaths
with
such
a
strong
southern
accent
that
all
the
guests
looked
up
in
amazement
peyrade
discovering
his
blunder
acknowledged
his
disguise
by
saying
to
contenson
in
good
french
find
me
a
coach
i
m
every
one
rose
why
who
are
you
said
lucien
ja
who
said
the
baron
bixiou
told
me
you
shammed
englishman
better
than
he
could
and
i
would
not
believe
him
said
rastignac
some
bankrupt
caught
in
disguise
said
du
tillet
loudly
i
suspected
as
much
a
strange
place
is
paris
said
madame
du
after
being
bankrupt
in
his
own
part
of
town
a
merchant
turns
up
as
a
nabob
or
a
dandy
in
the
with
impunity
oh
i
am
unlucky
bankrupts
are
my
every
flower
has
its
peculiar
blight
said
esther
quietly
mine
is
like
cleopatra
s
an
who
am
i
echoed
peyrade
from
the
door
you
will
know
ere
long
for
if
i
die
i
will
rise
from
my
grave
to
clutch
your
feet
every
night
he
looked
at
esther
and
lucien
as
he
spoke
then
he
took
advantage
of
the
general
dismay
to
vanish
with
the
utmost
rapidity
meaning
to
run
home
without
waiting
for
the
coach
in
the
street
the
spy
was
gripped
by
the
arm
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
outer
gate
it
was
asie
wrapped
in
a
black
hood
such
as
ladies
then
wore
on
leaving
a
ball
send
for
the
sacraments
papa
peyrade
said
she
in
the
voice
that
had
already
prophesied
a
coach
was
waiting
asie
jumped
in
and
the
carriage
vanished
as
though
the
wind
had
swept
it
away
there
were
five
carriages
waiting
peyrade
s
men
could
find
out
nothing
on
reaching
his
house
in
the
rue
des
vignes
one
of
the
quietest
and
prettiest
nooks
of
the
little
town
of
passy
corentin
who
was
known
there
as
a
retired
merchant
passionately
devoted
to
gardening
found
his
friend
peyrade
s
note
in
cipher
instead
of
resting
he
got
into
the
hackney
coach
that
had
brought
him
thither
and
was
driven
to
the
rue
des
moineaux
where
he
found
only
katt
from
her
he
heard
of
lydie
s
disappearance
and
remained
astounded
at
peyrade
s
and
his
own
want
of
foresight
but
they
do
not
know
me
yet
said
he
to
himself
this
crew
is
capable
of
anything
i
must
find
out
if
they
are
killing
peyrade
for
if
so
i
must
not
be
seen
any
more
the
viler
a
man
s
life
is
the
more
he
clings
to
it
it
becomes
at
every
moment
a
protest
and
a
revenge
corentin
went
back
to
the
cab
and
drove
to
his
rooms
to
assume
the
disguise
of
a
feeble
old
man
in
a
scanty
greenish
overcoat
and
a
tow
wig
then
he
returned
on
foot
prompted
by
his
friendship
for
peyrade
he
intended
to
give
instructions
to
his
most
devoted
and
cleverest
underlings
as
he
went
along
the
rue
to
reach
the
rue
from
the
place
vendome
he
came
up
behind
a
girl
in
slippers
and
dressed
as
a
woman
dresses
for
the
night
she
had
on
a
white
and
a
nightcap
and
from
time
to
time
gave
vent
to
a
sob
and
an
involuntary
groan
corentin
her
and
turning
round
recognized
lydie
i
am
a
friend
of
your
father
s
of
monsieur
canquoelle
s
said
he
in
his
natural
voice
ah
then
here
is
some
one
i
can
trust
said
she
do
not
seem
to
have
recognized
me
corentin
went
on
for
we
are
pursued
by
relentless
foes
and
are
obliged
to
disguise
ourselves
but
tell
me
what
has
befallen
you
oh
monsieur
said
the
poor
child

facts
but

story

do
not
know

fled
with
such
precipitancy
i
have
come
through
so
many
streets
round
so
many
turnings
fancying
i
was
being
followed
and
when
i
met
any
one
that
seemed
decent
i
asked
my
way
to
get
back
to
the
boulevards
so
as
to
find
the
rue
de
la
paix
and
at
last
after
walking
what
o
clock
is
it
monsieur

corentin
i
escaped

nightfall

to
rest
in
the
grave
and
i
will
go
and
wait
for
death
in
a
convent
if
i
am
worthy
to
be
admitted
poor
little
girl
but
you
struggled
oh
yes
oh
if
you
could
only
imagine
the
abject
creatures
they
placed
me
with
they
sent
you
to
sleep
no
doubt
ah
that
is
it
cried
poor
lydie
a
little
more
strength
and
i
should
be
at
home
i
feel
that
i
am
dropping
and
my
brain
is
not
quite
just
now
i
fancied
i
was
in
a
garden
corentin
took
lydie
in
his
arms
and
she
lost
consciousness
he
carried
her
upstairs
katt
he
called
katt
came
out
with
exclamations
of
joy
don
t
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
be
glad
said
corentin
gravely
the
girl
is
very
when
lydie
was
laid
on
her
bed
and
recognized
her
own
room
by
the
light
of
two
candles
that
katt
lighted
she
became
delirious
she
sang
scraps
of
pretty
airs
broken
by
vociferations
of
horrible
sentences
she
had
heard
her
pretty
face
was
mottled
with
purple
patches
she
mixed
up
the
reminiscences
of
her
pure
childhood
with
those
of
these
ten
days
of
infamy
katt
sat
weeping
corentin
paced
the
room
stopping
now
and
again
to
gaze
at
lydie
she
is
paying
her
father
s
debt
said
he
is
there
a
providence
above
oh
i
was
wise
not
to
have
a
family
on
my
word
of
honor
a
child
is
indeed
a
hostage
given
to
misfortune
as
some
philosopher
has
oh
cried
the
poor
child
sitting
up
in
bed
and
throwing
back
her
fine
long
hair
instead
of
lying
here
katt
i
ought
to
be
stretched
in
the
sand
at
the
bottom
of
the
seine
katt
instead
of
crying
and
looking
at
your
child
which
will
never
cure
her
you
ought
to
go
for
a
doctor
the
medical
officer
in
the
first
instance
and
then
monsieur
desplein
and
monsieur
bianchon
we
must
save
this
innocent
and
corentin
wrote
down
the
addresses
of
these
two
famous
physicians
at
this
moment
up
the
stairs
came
some
one
to
whom
they
were
familiar
and
the
door
was
opened
peyrade
in
a
violent
sweat
his
face
purple
his
eyes
almost
and
gasping
like
a
dolphin
rushed
from
the
outer
door
to
lydie
s
room
exclaiming
where
is
my
child
he
saw
a
melancholy
sign
from
corentin
and
his
eyes
followed
his
friend
s
hand
lydie
s
condition
can
only
be
compared
to
that
of
a
flower
tenderly
cherished
by
a
gardener
now
fallen
from
its
stem
and
crushed
by
the
shoes
of
some
peasant
ascribe
this
simile
to
a
father
s
heart
and
you
will
understand
the
blow
that
fell
on
peyrade
the
tears
started
to
his
eyes
you
are
crying
it
is
my
father
said
the
girl
she
could
still
recognize
her
father
she
got
out
of
bed
and
fell
on
her
knees
at
the
old
man
s
side
as
he
sank
into
a
chair
forgive
me
papa
said
she
in
a
tone
that
pierced
peyrade
s
heart
and
at
the
same
moment
he
was
conscious
of
what
felt
like
a
tremendous
blow
on
his
head
i
am
dying
the
villains
were
his
last
words
corentin
tried
to
help
his
friend
and
received
his
latest
breath
dead
poisoned
said
he
to
himself
ah
here
is
the
doctor
he
exclaimed
hearing
the
sound
of
wheels
contenson
who
came
with
his
mulatto
disguise
removed
stood
like
a
bronze
statue
as
he
heard
lydie
say
then
you
do
not
forgive
me
father
but
it
was
not
my
fault
she
did
not
understand
that
her
father
was
dead
oh
how
he
stares
at
me
cried
the
poor
crazy
girl
we
must
close
his
eyes
said
contenson
lifting
peyrade
on
to
the
bed
we
are
doing
a
stupid
thing
said
corentin
let
us
carry
him
into
his
own
room
his
daughter
is
half
demented
and
she
will
go
quite
mad
when
she
sees
that
he
is
dead
she
will
fancy
that
she
has
killed
lydie
seeing
them
carry
away
her
father
looked
quite
stupefied
there
lies
my
only
friend
said
corentin
seeming
much
moved
when
peyrade
was
laid
out
on
the
bed
in
his
own
room
in
all
his
life
he
never
had
but
one
impulse
of
cupidity
and
that
was
for
his
daughter
let
him
be
an
example
to
you
contenson
every
line
of
life
has
its
code
of
honor
peyrade
did
wrong
when
he
mixed
himself
up
with
private
concerns
we
have
no
business
to
meddle
with
any
but
public
cases
but
come
what
may
i
swear
said
he
with
a
voice
an
emphasis
a
look
that
struck
horror
into
contenson
to
avenge
my
poor
peyrade
i
will
discover
the
men
who
are
guilty
of
his
death
and
of
his
daughter
s
ruin
and
as
sure
as
i
am
myself
as
i
have
yet
a
few
days
to
live
which
i
will
risk
to
accomplish
that
vengeance
every
man
of
them
shall
die
at
four
o
clock
in
good
health
by
a
clean
shave
on
the
place
de
and
i
will
help
you
said
contenson
with
feeling
nothing
in
fact
is
more
than
the
spectacle
of
passion
in
a
cold
and
methodical
man
in
whom
for
twenty
years
no
one
has
ever
detected
the
smallest
impulse
of
sentiment
it
is
like
a
molten
bar
of
iron
which
melts
everything
it
touches
and
contenson
was
moved
to
his
depths
poor
old
canquoelle
said
he
looking
at
corentin
he
has
treated
me
many
a
and
i
tell
you
only
your
bad
sort
know
how
to
do
such
things
but
often
has
he
given
me
ten
francs
to
go
and
gamble
with
after
this
funeral
oration
peyrade
s
two
avengers
went
back
to
lydie
s
room
hearing
katt
and
the
medical
officer
from
the
mairie
on
the
stairs
go
and
fetch
the
chief
of
police
said
corentin
the
public
prosecutor
will
not
find
grounds
for
a
prosecution
in
the
case
still
we
will
report
it
to
the
prefecture
it
may
perhaps
be
of
some
use
monsieur
he
went
on
to
the
medical
officer
in
this
room
you
will
see
a
dead
man
i
do
not
believe
that
he
died
from
natural
causes
you
will
be
good
enough
to
make
a
in
the
presence
of
the
chief
of
the
police
who
will
come
at
my
request
try
to
discover
some
traces
of
poison
you
will
in
a
few
minutes
have
the
opinion
of
monsieur
desplein
and
monsieur
bianchon
for
whom
i
have
sent
to
examine
the
daughter
of
my
best
friend
she
is
in
a
worse
plight
than
he
though
he
is
i
have
no
need
of
those
gentlemen
s
assistance
in
the
exercise
of
my
duty
said
the
medical
officer
well
well
thought
corentin
let
us
have
no
clashing
monsieur
he
said
in
a
few
words
i
give
you
my
opinion
those
who
have
just
murdered
the
father
have
also
ruined
the
by
daylight
lydie
had
yielded
to
fatigue
when
the
great
surgeon
and
the
young
physician
arrived
she
was
asleep
the
doctor
whose
duty
it
was
to
sign
the
death
certificate
had
now
opened
peyrade
s
body
and
was
seeking
the
cause
of
death
while
waiting
for
your
patient
to
awake
said
corentin
to
the
two
famous
doctors
would
you
join
one
of
your
professional
brethren
in
an
examination
which
can
not
fail
to
interest
you
and
your
opinion
will
be
valuable
in
case
of
an
your
relations
died
of
apoplexy
said
the
official
there
are
all
the
symptoms
of
violent
congestion
of
the
examine
him
gentlemen
and
see
if
there
is
no
poison
capable
of
producing
similar
the
stomach
is
in
fact
full
of
food
substances
but
short
of
chemical
analysis
i
find
no
evidence
of
poison
if
the
characters
of
cerebral
congestion
are
well
ascertained
we
have
here
considering
the
patient
s
age
a
sufficient
cause
of
death
observed
desplein
looking
at
the
enormous
mass
of
material
did
he
sup
here
asked
bianchon
no
said
corentin
he
came
here
in
great
haste
from
the
boulevard
and
found
his
daughter
ruined
that
was
the
poison
if
he
loved
his
daughter
said
bianchon
what
known
poison
could
produce
a
similar
effect
asked
corentin
clinging
to
his
idea
there
is
but
one
said
desplein
after
a
careful
examination
it
is
a
poison
found
in
the
malayan
archipelago
and
derived
from
trees
as
yet
but
little
known
of
the
strychnos
family
it
is
used
to
poison
that
dangerous
weapon
the
malay
at
least
so
it
is
the
police
commissioner
presently
arrived
corentin
told
him
his
suspicions
and
begged
him
to
draw
up
a
report
telling
him
where
and
with
whom
peyrade
had
supped
and
the
causes
of
the
state
in
which
he
found
lydie
corentin
then
went
to
lydie
s
rooms
desplein
and
bianchon
had
been
examining
the
poor
child
he
met
them
at
the
door
well
gentlemen
asked
corentin
place
the
girl
under
medical
care
unless
she
recovers
her
wits
when
her
child
is
born
if
indeed
she
should
have
a
child
she
will
end
her
days
there
is
no
hope
of
a
cure
but
in
the
maternal
instinct
if
it
can
be
corentin
paid
each
of
the
physicians
forty
francs
in
gold
and
then
turned
to
the
police
commissioner
who
had
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
the
medical
officer
insists
on
it
that
death
was
natural
said
this
functionary
and
i
can
hardly
report
the
case
especially
as
the
dead
man
was
old
canquoelle
he
had
his
finger
in
too
many
pies
and
we
should
not
be
sure
whom
we
might
run
foul
of
men
like
that
die
to
order
very
often
and
my
name
is
corentin
said
corentin
in
the
man
s
ear
the
commissioner
started
with
surprise
so
just
make
a
note
of
all
this
corentin
went
on
it
will
be
very
useful
by
and
by
send
it
up
only
as
confidential
information
the
crime
can
not
be
proved
and
i
know
that
any
inquiry
would
be
checked
at
the
very
but
i
will
catch
the
criminals
some
day
yet
i
will
watch
them
and
take
them
the
police
official
bowed
to
corentin
and
left
monsieur
said
katt
mademoiselle
does
nothing
but
dance
and
sing
what
can
i
do
has
any
change
occurred
then
she
has
understood
that
her
father
is
just
put
her
into
a
hackney
coach
and
simply
take
her
to
charenton
i
will
write
a
note
to
the
of
police
to
secure
her
being
suitably
provided
the
daughter
in
charenton
the
father
in
a
pauper
s
grave
said
corentin
contenson
go
and
fetch
the
parish
hearse
and
now
don
carlos
herrera
you
and
i
will
fight
it
out
carlos
said
contenson
he
is
in
he
is
in
paris
said
corentin
positively
there
is
a
touch
of
spanish
genius
of
the
philip
ii
type
in
all
this
but
i
have
pitfalls
for
everybody
even
for
five
days
after
the
nabob
s
disappearance
madame
du
was
sitting
by
esther
s
bedside
weeping
for
she
felt
herself
on
one
of
the
slopes
down
to
poverty
if
i
only
had
at
least
a
hundred
louis
a
year
with
that
sum
my
dear
a
woman
can
retire
to
some
little
town
and
find
a
husband
i
can
get
you
as
much
as
that
said
esther
how
cried
madame
du
oh
in
a
very
simple
way
listen
you
must
plan
to
kill
yourself
play
your
part
well
send
for
asie
and
offer
her
ten
thousand
francs
for
two
black
beads
of
very
thin
glass
containing
a
poison
which
kills
you
in
a
second
bring
them
to
me
and
i
will
give
you
fifty
thousand
francs
for
why
do
you
not
ask
her
for
them
yourself
said
her
friend
asie
would
not
sell
them
to
they
are
not
for
yourself
asked
madame
du
you
who
live
in
the
midst
of
pleasure
and
luxury
in
a
house
of
your
own
and
on
the
eve
of
an
entertainment
which
will
be
the
talk
of
paris
for
ten
years
which
is
to
cost
nucingen
twenty
thousand
francs
there
are
to
be
strawberries
in
they
say
asparagus
grapes
melons
and
a
thousand
crowns
worth
of
flowers
in
the
what
are
you
talking
about
there
are
a
thousand
crowns
worth
of
roses
on
the
stairs
and
your
gown
is
said
to
have
cost
ten
thousand
francs
yes
it
is
of
brussels
point
and
delphine
his
wife
is
furious
but
i
had
a
fancy
to
be
disguised
as
a
where
are
the
ten
thousand
francs
asked
madame
du
it
is
all
the
ready
money
i
have
said
esther
smiling
open
my
table
drawer
it
is
under
the
people
who
talk
of
dying
never
kill
themselves
said
madame
du
if
it
were
to
commit
a
crime
for
shame
said
esther
finishing
her
friend
s
thought
as
she
hesitated
be
quite
easy
i
have
no
intention
of
killing
anybody
i
had
a
friend
a
very
happy
woman
she
is
dead
i
must
follow
her
that
is
how
foolish
how
can
i
help
it
i
promised
her
i
i
should
let
that
bill
go
dishonored
said
her
friend
smiling
do
as
i
tell
you
and
go
at
once
i
hear
a
carriage
coming
it
is
nucingen
a
man
who
will
go
mad
with
joy
yes
he
loves
me
why
do
we
not
love
those
who
love
us
for
indeed
they
do
all
they
can
to
please
us
ah
that
is
the
question
said
madame
du
it
is
the
old
story
of
the
herring
which
is
the
most
puzzling
fish
that
why
well
no
one
could
ever
find
get
along
my
dear
i
must
ask
for
your
fifty
thousand
for
three
days
past
esther
s
ways
with
the
baron
de
nucingen
had
completely
changed
the
monkey
had
become
a
cat
the
cat
had
become
a
woman
esther
poured
out
treasures
of
affection
on
the
old
man
she
was
quite
charming
her
way
of
addressing
him
with
a
total
absence
of
mischief
or
bitterness
and
all
sorts
of
tender
insinuation
had
carried
conviction
to
the
banker
s
slow
wit
she
called
him
fritz
and
he
believed
that
she
loved
him
my
poor
fritz
i
have
tried
you
sorely
said
she
i
have
teased
you
shamefully
your
patience
has
been
sublime
you
loved
me
i
see
and
i
will
reward
you
i
like
you
now
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
but
i
should
prefer
you
to
a
young
man
it
is
the
result
of
experience
in
the
long
run
we
discover
at
last
that
pleasure
is
the
coin
of
the
soul
and
it
is
not
more
flattering
to
be
loved
for
the
sake
of
pleasure
than
it
is
to
be
loved
for
the
sake
of
money
besides
young
men
are
too
selfish
they
think
more
of
themselves
than
of
us
while
you
now
think
only
of
me
i
am
all
your
life
to
you
and
i
will
take
nothing
more
from
you
i
want
to
prove

the
baron
so
sweetly
that
he
turned
pale
without
any
pills
oh
cried
she
do
not
suppose
that
i
am
sweet
to
you
only
for

thirty
thousand
francs
it
is
because

through
nucingen
s
hair
and
arranging
it
in
a
fashion
of
her
own
in
trees

a
so
next
morning
the
baron
brought
the
certificate
of
shares
he
came
to
breakfast
with
his
dear
little
girl
and
to
take
her
orders
for
the
following
evening
the
famous
saturday
the
great

the
banker
gleefully

afternoon
but
vy
dis
minute

cried
the
baron
i

clever
yes
i
shall
repeat
your
just
as
esther
had
sat
down
tired
with
the
effort
of
playing
her
part
europe
came
in
madame
said
she
here
is
a
messenger
sent
from
the
quai
malaquais
by
celestin

servant

no
i

into
the
he
has
a
letter
for
you
madame
from
esther
rushed
into
the
looked
at
the
messenger
and
saw
that
he
looked
like
the
genuine
thing
tell
to
come
down
said
esther
in
a
feeble
voice
and
dropping
into
a
chair
after
reading
the
letter
lucien
means
to
kill
himself
she
added
in
a
whisper
to
europe
no
take
the
letter
up
to
carlos
herrera
still
in
his
disguise
as
a
bagman
came
downstairs
at
once
and
keenly
scrutinized
the
messenger
on
seeing
a
stranger
in
the
you
said
there
was
no
one
here
said
he
in
a
whisper
to
europe
and
with
an
excess
of
prudence
after
looking
at
the
messenger
he
went
straight
into
the
did
not
know
that
for
some
time
past
the
famous
constable
of
the
detective
force
who
had
arrested
him
at
the
maison
vauquer
had
a
rival
who
it
was
supposed
would
replace
him
this
rival
was
the
messenger
they
are
right
said
the
sham
messenger
to
contenson
who
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
street
the
man
you
describe
is
in
the
house
but
he
is
not
a
spaniard
and
i
will
burn
my
hand
off
if
there
is
not
a
bird
for
our
net
under
that
priest
s
he
is
no
more
a
priest
than
he
is
a
spaniard
said
contenson
i
am
sure
of
that
said
the
detective
oh
if
only
we
were
right
said
contenson
lucien
had
been
away
for
two
days
and
advantage
had
been
taken
of
his
absence
to
lay
this
snare
but
he
returned
this
evening
and
the
courtesan
s
anxieties
were
allayed
next
morning
at
the
hour
when
esther
having
taken
a
bath
was
getting
into
bed
again
madame
du
arrived
i
have
the
two
pills
said
her
friend
let
me
see
said
esther
raising
herself
with
her
pretty
elbow
buried
in
a
pillow
trimmed
with
lace
madame
du
held
out
to
her
what
looked
like
two
black
currants
the
baron
had
given
esther
a
pair
of
greyhounds
of
famous
pedigree
which
will
be
always
known
by
the
name
of
the
great
contemporary
poet
who
made
them
fashionable
and
esther
proud
of
owning
them
had
called
them
by
the
names
of
their
parents
romeo
and
juliet
no
need
here
to
describe
the
whiteness
and
grace
of
these
beasts
trained
for
the
with
manners
suggestive
of
english
propriety
esther
called
romeo
romeo
ran
up
on
legs
so
supple
and
thin
so
strong
and
sinewy
that
they
seemed
like
steel
springs
and
looked
up
at
his
mistress
esther
to
attract
his
attention
pretended
to
throw
one
of
the
pills
he
is
doomed
by
his
nature
to
die
thus
said
she
as
she
threw
the
pill
which
romeo
crushed
between
his
teeth
the
dog
made
no
sound
he
rolled
over
and
was
stark
dead
it
was
all
over
while
esther
spoke
these
words
of
epitaph
good
god
shrieked
madame
du
you
have
a
cab
waiting
carry
away
the
departed
romeo
said
esther
his
death
would
make
a
commotion
here
i
have
given
him
to
you
and
you
have
lost
him
advertise
for
him
make
haste
you
will
have
your
fifty
thousand
francs
this
she
spoke
so
calmly
so
entirely
with
the
cold
indifference
of
a
courtesan
that
madame
du
exclaimed
you
are
the
queen
of
us
all
come
early
and
look
very
well
at
five
o
clock
esther
dressed
herself
as
a
bride
she
put
on
her
lace
dress
over
white
satin
she
had
a
white
sash
white
satin
shoes
and
a
scarf
of
english
point
lace
over
her
beautiful
shoulders
in
her
hair
she
placed
white
camellia
flowers
the
simple
ornament
of
an
innocent
girl
on
her
bosom
lay
a
pearl
necklace
worth
thirty
thousand
francs
a
gift
from
nucingen
though
she
was
dressed
by
six
she
refused
to
see
anybody
even
the
banker
europe
knew
that
lucien
was
to
be
admitted
to
her
room
lucien
came
at
about
seven
and
europe
managed
to
get
him
up
to
her
mistress
without
anybody
knowing
of
his
arrival
lucien
as
he
looked
at
her
said
to
himself
why
not
go
and
live
with
her
at
rubempre
far
from
the
world
and
never
see
paris
again
i
have
an
earnest
of
five
years
of
her
life
and
the
dear
creature
is
one
of
those
who
never
belie
themselves
where
can
i
find
such
another
perfect
masterpiece
my
dear
you
whom
i
have
made
my
god
said
esther
kneeling
down
on
a
cushion
in
front
of
lucien
give
me
your
lucien
tried
to
raise
her
and
kiss
her
saying
what
is
this
jest
my
dear
love
and
he
would
have
put
his
arm
round
her
but
she
freed
herself
with
a
gesture
as
much
of
respect
as
of
horror
i
am
no
longer
worthy
of
you
lucien
said
she
letting
the
tears
rise
to
her
eyes
i
implore
you
give
me
your
blessing
and
swear
to
me
that
you
will
found
two
beds
at
the
for
as
to
prayers
in
church
god
will
never
forgive
me
unless
i
pray
myself
i
have
loved
you
too
well
my
dear
tell
me
that
i
made
you
happy
and
that
you
will
sometimes
think
of
tell
me
that
lucien
saw
that
esther
was
solemnly
in
earnest
and
he
sat
thinking
you
mean
to
kill
yourself
said
he
at
last
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
revealed
deep
reflection
no
said
she
but
my
dear
the
woman
dies
the
pure
chaste
and
loving
woman
who
once
was
and
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
i
shall
die
of
poor
child
said
lucien
wait
i
have
worked
hard
these
two
days
i
have
succeeded
in
seeing
clotilde
always
clotilde
cried
esther
in
a
tone
of
concentrated
rage
yes
said
he
we
have
written
to
each
on
tuesday
morning
she
is
to
set
out
for
italy
but
i
shall
meet
her
on
the
road
for
an
interview
at
bless
me
what
is
it
that
you
men
want
for
wives
wooden
laths
cried
poor
esther
if
i
had
seven
or
eight
millions
would
you
not
marry
me
come
now
child
i
was
going
to
say
that
if
all
is
over
for
me
i
will
have
no
wife
but
esther
bent
her
head
to
hide
her
sudden
pallor
and
the
tears
she
wiped
away
you
love
me
said
she
looking
at
lucien
with
the
deepest
melancholy
well
that
is
my
sufficient
do
not
compromise
yourself
go
away
by
the
side
door
and
come
in
to
the
through
the
kiss
me
on
the
she
threw
her
arms
round
lucien
clasped
him
to
her
heart
with
frenzy
and
said
again
go
only
go
or
i
must
when
the
doomed
woman
appeared
in
the
there
was
a
cry
of
admiration
esther
s
eyes
expressed
infinitude
in
which
the
soul
sank
as
it
looked
into
them
her
and
beautiful
hair
set
off
the
camellias
in
short
this
exquisite
creature
achieved
all
the
effects
she
had
intended
she
had
no
rival
she
looked
like
the
supreme
expression
of
that
unbridled
luxury
which
surrounded
her
in
every
form
then
she
was
brilliantly
witty
she
ruled
the
orgy
with
the
cold
calm
power
that
habeneck
displays
when
conducting
at
the
conservatoire
at
those
concerts
where
the
first
musicians
in
europe
rise
to
the
sublime
in
interpreting
mozart
and
beethoven
but
she
observed
with
terror
that
nucingen
ate
little
drank
nothing
and
was
quite
the
master
of
the
house
by
midnight
everybody
was
crazy
the
glasses
were
broken
that
they
might
never
be
used
again
two
of
the
chinese
curtains
were
torn
bixiou
was
drunk
for
the
second
time
in
his
life
no
one
could
keep
his
feet
the
women
were
asleep
on
the
sofas
and
the
guests
were
incapable
of
carrying
out
the
practical
joke
they
had
planned
of
escorting
esther
and
nucingen
to
the
bedroom
standing
in
two
lines
with
candles
in
their
hands
and
singing
from
the
of
nucingen
simply
gave
esther
his
hand
bixiou

saw
them

tipsy

occasion
of

be
warned

off
the
false
hair
he
had
combed
in

his
gray
hairs
these
three
months
past
a
piercing
shriek
from
europe
made
nucingen
quail
to
his
very
bowels
the
poor
banker
rose
and
walked
upstairs
on
legs
that
were
drunk
with
the
bowl
of
disenchantment

had
just
swallowed

nothing

their

was
a
banker
again
a
suspicion
crossed
his

and
he
was
so
imprudent
as
to
ask
what

hundred
and
fifty
thousand

the
price
of

europe
looked
at

so
strangely
that
monsieur

left
the
house
at
once
believing
that
robbery
and
murder
had
been
committed
europe
detecting
a
packet
of
soft
consistency
betraying

poor
madame

uncle
said
she
europe
s
stratagem
was
understood
by
paccard
as
soon
as
asie
s
back
was
turned
europe
opened
the
packet
on
which
the
hapless
courtesan
had
written
to
be
delivered
to
monsieur
lucien
de
seven
hundred
and
fifty
notes
shone
in
the
eyes
of
prudence
servien
who
exclaimed
won
t
we
be
happy
and
honest
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
paccard
made
no
objection
his
instincts
as
a
thief
were
stronger
than
his
attachment
to
durut
is
dead
he
said
at
length
my
shoulder
is
still
a
proof
before
letters
let
us
be
off
together
divide
the
money
so
as
not
to
have
all
our
eggs
in
one
basket
and
then
get
but
where
can
we
hide
said
prudence
in
paris
replied
paccard
prudence
and
paccard
went
off
at
once
with
the
promptitude
of
two
honest
folks
transformed
into
robbers
my
child
said
carlos
to
asie
as
soon
as
she
had
said
three
words
find
some
letter
of
esther
s
while
i
write
a
formal
will
and
then
take
the
copy
and
the
letter
to
girard
but
he
must
be
quick
the
will
must
be
under
esther
s
pillow
before
the
lawyers
affix
the
seals
and
he
wrote
out
the
following
will
never
having
loved
any
one
on
earth
but
monsieur
lucien
chardon
de
rubempre
and
being
resolved
to
end
my
life
rather
than
relapse
into
vice
and
the
life
of
infamy
from
which
he
rescued
me
i
give
and
bequeath
to
the
said
lucien
chardon
de
rubempre
all
i
may
possess
at
the
time
of
my
decease
on
condition
of
his
founding
a
mass
in
perpetuity
in
the
parish
church
of
for
the
repose
of
her
who
gave
him
her
all
to
her
last
thought
esther
that
is
quite
in
her
style
thought
by
seven
in
the
evening
this
document
written
and
sealed
was
placed
by
asie
under
esther
s
bolster
jacques
said
she
flying
upstairs
again
just
as
i
came
out
of
the
room
justice
marched
in
the
justice
of
the
peace
you
mean
no
my
son
the
justice
of
the
peace
was
there
but
he
had
gendarmes
with
him
the
public
prosecutor
and
the
examining
judge
are
there
too
and
the
doors
are
this
death
has
made
a
stir
very
quickly
remarked
jacques
collin
ay
and
paccard
and
europe
have
vanished
i
am
afraid
they
may
have
scared
away
the
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
said
asie
the
low
villains
said
collin
they
have
done
for
us
by
their
swindling
human
justice
and
paris
justice
that
is
to
say
the
most
suspicious
keenest
cleverest
and
omniscient
type
of
justice
too
clever
indeed
for
it
insists
on
interpreting
the
law
at
every
turn
was
at
last
on
the
point
of
laying
its
hand
on
the
agents
of
this
horrible
intrigue
the
baron
of
nucingen
on
recognizing
the
evidence
of
poison
and
failing
to
find
his
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
imagined
that
one
of
two
persons
whom
he
greatly
disliked
either
paccard
or
europe
was
guilty
of
the
crime
in
his
first
impulse
of
rage
he
flew
to
the
prefecture
of
police
this
was
a
stroke
of
a
bell
that
called
up
all
corentin
s
men
the
officials
of
the
prefecture
the
legal
profession
the
chief
of
the
police
the
justice
of
the
peace
the
examining
judge
all
were
astir
by
nine
in
the
evening
three
medical
men
were
called
in
to
perform
an
autopsy
on
poor
esther
and
inquiries
were
set
on
foot
warned
by
asie
exclaimed
no
one
knows
that

am
here
i
may
take

he
pulled
himself
up
by
the
skylight
of
his
garret
and
with
marvelous
agility
was
standing
in
an
instant
on
the
roof
whence
he
surveyed
the
surroundings
with
the
coolness
of
a
tiler

said
he
discerning
a
garden
five
houses
off
in
the
rue
de
provence
that
will
just
do
for

paid
out
said
contenson
suddenly
emerging
from
behind
a
stack
of
chimneys
you
may
explain
to
monsieur
camusot
what
mass
you
were
performing
on
the
roof
monsieur
l
abbe
and
above
all
why
you
were
escaping
i
have
enemies
in
spain
said
carlos
herrera
we
can
go
there
by
way
of
your
attic
said
contenson
the
sham
spaniard
pretended
to
yield
but
having
set
his
back
and
feet
across
the
opening
of
the
skylight
he
gripped
contenson
and
flung
him
off
with
such
violence
that
the
spy
fell
in
the
gutter
of
the
rue
contenson
was
dead
on
his
field
of
honor
jacques
collin
quietly
dropped
into
the
room
again
and
went
to
bed
give
me
something
that
will
make
me
very
sick
without
killing
me
said
he
to
asie
for
i
must
be
at
death
s
door
to
avoid
answering
inquisitive
persons
i
have
just
got
rid
of
a
man
in
the
most
natural
way
who
might
have
unmasked
at
seven
o
clock
on
the
previous
evening
lucien
had
set
out
in
his
own
chaise
to
post
to
fontainebleau
with
a
passport
he
had
procured
in
the
morning
he
slept
in
the
nearest
inn
on
the
nemours
side
at
six
in
the
morning
he
went
alone
and
on
foot
through
the
forest
as
far
as
bouron
this
said
he
to
himself
as
he
sat
down
on
one
of
the
rocks
that
command
the
fine
landscape
of
bouron
is
the
fatal
spot
where
napoleon
dreamed
of
making
a
final
tremendous
effort
on
the
eve
of
his
at
daybreak
he
heard
the
approach
of
and
saw
a
britska
drive
past
in
which
sat
the
servants
of
the
duchesse
de
and
clotilde
de
grandlieu
s
maid
here
they
are
thought
lucien
now
to
play
the
farce
well
and
i
shall
be
saved
the
duc
de
grandlieu
s
in
spite
of
him
it
was
an
hour
later
when
he
heard
the
peculiar
sound
made
by
a
superior
traveling
carriage
as
the
berline
came
near
in
which
two
ladies
were
sitting
they
had
given
orders
that
the
drag
should
be
put
on
for
the
hill
down
to
bouron
and
the
behind
the
carriage
had
it
stopped
at
this
instant
lucien
came
forward
clotilde
said
he
tapping
on
the
window
no
said
the
young
duchess
to
her
friend
he
shall
not
get
into
the
carriage
and
we
will
not
be
alone
with
him
my
dear
speak
to
him
for
the
last
time
to
that
i
consent
but
on
the
road
where
we
will
walk
on
and
where
baptiste
can
escort
the
morning
is
fine
we
are
well
wrapped
up
and
have
no
fear
of
the
cold
the
carriage
can
the
two
women
got
out
baptiste
said
the
duchess
the
can
follow
slowly
we
want
to
walk
a
little
way
you
must
keep
near
madeleine
de
mortsauf
took
clotilde
by
the
arm
and
allowed
lucien
to
talk
they
thus
walked
on
as
far
as
the
village
of
grez
it
was
now
eight
o
clock
and
there
clotilde
dismissed
lucien
well
my
friend
said
she
closing
this
long
interview
with
much
dignity
i
never
shall
marry
any
one
but
you
i
would
rather
believe
in
you
than
in
other
men
in
my
father
and
mother
no
woman
ever
gave
greater
proof
of
attachment
surely
now
try
to
counteract
the
fatal
prejudices
which
militate
against
just
then
the
tramp
of
galloping
horses
was
heard
and
to
the
great
amazement
of
the
ladies
a
force
of
gendarmes
surrounded
the
little
party
what
do
you
want
said
lucien
with
the
arrogance
of
a
dandy
are
you
monsieur
lucien
de
rubempre
asked
the
public
prosecutor
of
fontainebleau
yes
you
will
spend
in
la
force
said
he
i
have
a
warrant
for
the
detention
of
your
who
are
these
ladies
asked
the
sergeant
to
be
excuse
me
ladies
your
passports
for
monsieur
lucien
as
i
am
instructed
had
acquaintances
among
the
fair
sex
who
for
him
would
do
you
take
the
duchesse
de
for
a
prostitute
said
madeleine
with
a
magnificent
flash
at
the
public
prosecutor
you
are
handsome
enough
to
excuse
the
error
the
magistrate
very
cleverly
retorted
baptiste
produce
the
passports
said
the
young
duchess
with
a
smile
and
with
what
crime
is
monsieur
de
rubempre
charged
asked
clotilde
whom
the
duchess
wished
to
see
safe
in
the
carriage
of
being
accessory
to
a
robbery
and
murder
replied
the
sergeant
of
gendarmes
baptiste
lifted
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
into
the
chaise
in
a
dead
faint
by
midnight
lucien
was
entering
la
force
a
prison
situated
between
the
rue
payenne
and
the
rue
des
ballets
where
he
was
placed
in
solitary
confinement
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
was
also
there
having
been
arrested
that
evening
the
end
of
evil
ways
at
six
o
clock
next
morning
two
vehicles
with
postilions
prison
vans
called
in
the
vigorous
language
of
the
populace
a
came
out
of
la
force
to
drive
to
the
conciergerie
by
the
palais
de
justice
few
loafers
in
paris
can
have
failed
to
meet
this
prison
cell
on
wheels
still
though
most
stories
are
written
for
parisian
readers
strangers
will
no
doubt
be
satisfied
to
have
a
description
of
this
formidable
machine
who
knows
a
police
of
russia
germany
or
austria
the
legal
body
of
countries
to
whom
the
is
an
unknown
machine
may
profit
by
it
and
in
several
foreign
countries
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
an
imitation
of
this
vehicle
would
be
a
boon
to
prisoners
this
ignominious
conveyance
on
high
wheels
and
lined
with
is
divided
into
two
compartments
in
front
is
a
with
leather
cushions
and
an
apron
this
is
the
free
seat
of
the
van
and
accommodates
a
sheriff
s
officer
and
a
gendarme
a
strong
iron
trellis
reaching
to
the
top
separates
this
sort
of
from
the
back
division
in
which
there
are
two
wooden
seats
placed
sideways
as
in
an
omnibus
on
which
the
prisoners
sit
they
get
in
by
a
step
behind
and
a
door
with
no
window
the
nickname
of
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
vehicle
was
originally
made
entirely
of
lattice
and
the
prisoners
were
shaken
in
it
just
as
a
salad
is
shaken
to
dry
it
for
further
security
in
case
of
accident
a
mounted
gendarme
follows
the
machine
especially
when
it
conveys
criminals
condemned
to
death
to
the
place
of
execution
thus
escape
is
impossible
the
vehicle
lined
with
is
impervious
to
any
tool
the
prisoners
carefully
searched
when
they
are
arrested
or
locked
up
can
have
nothing
but
perhaps
to
file
through
bars
and
useless
on
a
smooth
surface
so
the
a
improved
by
the
genius
of
the
paris
police
became
the
model
for
the
prison
omnibus
known
in
london
as
black
maria
in
which
convicts
are
transported
to
the
hulks
instead
of
the
horrible
tumbril
which
formerly
disgraced
civilization
though
manon
lescaut
had
made
it
famous
the
accused
are
in
the
first
instance
despatched
in
the
prison
van
from
the
various
prisons
in
paris
to
the
palais
de
justice
to
be
questioned
by
the
examining
judge
this
in
prison
slang
is
called
going
up
for
then
the
accused
are
again
conveyed
from
prison
to
the
court
to
be
sentenced
when
their
case
is
only
a
misdemeanor
or
if
in
legal
parlance
the
case
is
one
for
the
upper
court
they
are
transferred
from
the
house
of
detention
to
the
conciergerie
the
newgate
of
the
department
of
the
seine
finally
the
prison
van
carries
the
criminal
condemned
to
death
from
bicetre
to
the
barriere
where
executions
are
carried
out
and
have
been
ever
since
the
revolution
of
july
thanks
to
philanthropic
interference
the
poor
wretches
no
longer
have
to
face
the
horrors
of
the
drive
from
the
conciergerie
to
the
place
de
greve
in
a
cart
exactly
like
that
used
by
wood
merchants
this
cart
is
no
longer
used
but
to
bring
the
body
back
from
the
scaffold
without
this
explanation
the
words
of
a
famous
convict
to
his
accomplice
it
is
now
the
horse
s
business
as
he
got
into
the
van
would
be
unintelligible
it
is
impossible
to
be
carried
to
execution
more
comfortably
than
in
paris
nowadays
at
this
moment
the
two
vans
setting
out
at
such
an
early
hour
were
employed
on
the
unwonted
service
of
conveying
two
accused
prisoners
from
the
jail
of
la
force
to
the
conciergerie
and
each
man
had
a
to
himself
of
my
readers
ay
and
of
the
remaining
tenth
are
certainly
ignorant
of
the
vast
difference
of
meaning
in
the
words
incriminated
suspected
accused
and
committed
for
trial
jail
house
of
detention
and
penitentiary
and
they
may
be
surprised
to
learn
here
that
it
involves
all
our
criminal
procedure
of
which
a
clear
and
brief
outline
will
presently
be
sketched
as
much
for
their
information
as
for
the
elucidation
of
this
history
however
when
it
is
said
that
the
first
van
contained
jacques
collin
and
the
second
lucien
who
in
a
few
hours
had
fallen
from
the
summit
of
social
splendor
to
the
depths
of
a
prison
cell
curiosity
will
for
the
moment
be
satisfied
the
conduct
of
the
two
accomplices
was
characteristic
lucien
de
rubempre
shrank
back
to
avoid
the
gaze
of
the
who
looked
at
the
grated
window
of
the
gloomy
and
fateful
vehicle
on
its
road
along
the
rue
and
the
rue
du
martroi
to
reach
the
quay
and
the
arch
of
the
way
at
that
time
across
the
place
de
l
hotel
de
ville
this
archway
now
forms
the
entrance
gate
to
the
residence
of
the
prefet
de
la
seine
in
the
huge
municipal
palace
the
daring
convict
on
the
contrary
stuck
his
face
against
the
barred
grating
between
the
officer
and
the
gendarme
who
sure
of
their
van
were
chatting
together
the
great
days
of
july
and
the
tremendous
storm
that
then
burst
have
so
completely
wiped
out
the
memory
of
all
previous
events
and
politics
so
entirely
absorbed
the
french
during
the
last
six
months
of
that
year
that
no
one
remembers
or
a
few
scarcely
remember
the
various
private
judicial
and
financial
catastrophes
strange
as
they
were
which
forming
the
annual
flood
of
parisian
curiosity
were
not
lacking
during
the
first
six
months
of
the
year
it
is
therefore
needful
to
mention
how
paris
was
for
the
moment
excited
by
the
news
of
the
arrest
of
a
spanish
priest
discovered
in
a
courtesan
s
house
and
that
of
the
elegant
lucien
de
rubempre
who
had
been
engaged
to
mademoiselle
clotilde
de
grandlieu
taken
on
the
highroad
to
italy
close
to
the
little
village
of
grez
both
were
charged
as
being
concerned
in
a
murder
of
which
the
profits
were
stated
at
seven
millions
of
francs
and
for
some
days
the
scandal
of
this
trial
preponderated
over
the
absorbing
importance
of
the
last
elections
held
under
charles
x
in
the
first
place
the
charge
had
been
based
on
an
application
by
the
baron
de
nucingen
then
lucien
s
apprehension
just
as
he
was
about
to
be
appointed
private
secretary
to
the
prime
minister
made
a
stir
in
the
very
highest
circles
of
society
in
every
in
paris
more
than
one
young
man
could
recollect
having
envied
lucien
when
he
was
honored
by
the
notice
of
the
beautiful
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
and
every
woman
knew
that
he
was
the
favored
attache
of
madame
de
serizy
the
wife
of
one
of
the
government
bigwigs
and
finally
his
handsome
person
gave
him
a
singular
notoriety
in
the
various
worlds
that
make
up
paris
the
world
of
fashion
the
financial
world
the
world
of
courtesans
the
young
men
s
world
the
literary
world
so
for
two
days
past
all
paris
had
been
talking
of
these
two
arrests
the
examining
judge
in
whose
hands
the
case
was
put
regarded
it
as
a
chance
for
promotion
and
to
proceed
with
the
utmost
rapidity
he
had
given
orders
that
both
the
accused
should
be
transferred
from
la
force
to
the
conciergerie
as
soon
as
lucien
de
rubempre
could
be
brought
from
fontainebleau
as
the
abbe
carlos
had
spent
but
twelve
hours
in
la
force
and
lucien
only
half
a
night
it
is
useless
to
describe
that
prison
which
has
since
been
entirely
remodeled
and
as
to
the
details
of
their
consignment
it
would
be
only
a
repetition
of
the
same
story
at
the
conciergerie
but
before
setting
forth
the
terrible
drama
of
a
criminal
inquiry
it
is
indispensable
as
i
have
said
that
an
account
should
be
given
of
the
ordinary
proceedings
in
a
case
of
this
kind
to
begin
with
its
various
phases
will
be
better
understood
at
home
and
abroad
and
besides
those
who
are
ignorant
of
the
action
of
the
criminal
law
as
conceived
of
by
the
lawgivers
under
napoleon
will
appreciate
it
better
this
is
all
the
more
important
as
at
this
moment
this
great
and
noble
institution
is
in
danger
of
destruction
by
the
system
known
as
penitentiary
a
crime
is
committed
if
it
is
flagrant
the
persons
incriminated
inculpes
are
taken
to
the
nearest
and
placed
in
the
cell
known
to
the
vulgar
as
the
violon
perhaps
because
they
make
a
noise
there
shrieking
or
crying
from
thence
the
suspected
persons
inculpes
are
taken
before
the
police
commissioner
or
magistrate
who
holds
a
preliminary
inquiry
and
can
dismiss
the
case
if
there
is
any
mistake
finally
they
are
conveyed
to
the
depot
of
the
prefecture
where
the
police
detains
them
pending
the
convenience
of
the
public
prosecutor
and
the
examining
judge
they
being
served
with
due
notice
more
or
less
quickly
according
to
the
gravity
of
the
case
come
and
examine
the
prisoners
who
are
still
provisionally
detained
having
due
regard
to
the
presumptive
evidence
the
examining
judge
then
issues
a
warrant
for
their
imprisonment
and
sends
the
suspected
persons
to
be
confined
in
a
jail
there
are
three
such
jails
maisons
d
arret
in
paris
la
force
and
les
madelonettes
observe
the
word
inculpe
incriminated
or
suspected
of
crime
the
french
code
has
created
three
essential
degrees
of
criminality
inculpe
first
degree
of
suspicion
prevenu
under
examination
accuse
fully
committed
for
trial
so
long
as
the
warrant
for
committal
remains
unsigned
the
supposed
criminal
is
regarded
as
merely
under
suspicion
inculpe
of
the
crime
or
felony
when
the
warrant
has
been
issued
he
becomes
the
accused
prevenu
and
is
regarded
as
such
so
long
as
the
inquiry
is
proceeding
when
the
inquiry
is
closed
and
as
soon
as
the
court
has
decided
that
the
accused
is
to
be
committed
for
trial
he
becomes
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
accuse
as
soon
as
the
superior
court
at
the
instance
of
the
public
prosecutor
has
pronounced
that
the
charge
is
so
far
proved
as
to
be
carried
to
the
assizes
thus
persons
suspected
of
crime
go
through
three
different
stages
three
siftings
before
coming
up
for
trial
before
the
judges
of
the
upper
court
the
high
justice
of
the
realm
at
the
first
stage
innocent
persons
have
abundant
means
of
exculpating
themselves
the
public
the
town
watch
the
police
at
the
second
state
they
appear
before
a
magistrate
face
to
face
with
the
witnesses
and
are
judged
by
a
tribunal
in
paris
or
by
the
collective
court
of
the
departments
at
the
third
stage
they
are
brought
before
a
bench
of
twelve
councillors
and
in
case
of
any
error
or
informality
the
prisoner
committed
for
trial
at
the
assizes
may
appeal
for
protection
to
the
supreme
court
the
jury
do
not
know
what
a
slap
in
the
face
they
give
to
popular
authority
to
administrative
and
judicial
functionaries
when
they
acquit
a
prisoner
and
so
in
my
opinion
it
is
hardly
possible
that
an
innocent
man
should
ever
find
himself
at
the
bar
of
an
assize
court
in
paris
i
say
nothing
of
other
seats
of
justice
the
detenu
is
the
convict
french
criminal
law
recognizes
imprisonment
of
three
degrees
corresponding
in
legal
distinction
to
these
three
degrees
of
suspicion
inquiry
and
conviction
mere
imprisonment
is
a
light
penalty
for
misdemeanor
but
detention
is
imprisonment
with
hard
labor
a
severe
and
sometimes
degrading
punishment
hence
those
persons
who
nowadays
are
in
favor
of
the
penitentiary
system
would
upset
an
admirable
scheme
of
criminal
law
in
which
the
penalties
are
judiciously
graduated
and
they
will
end
by
punishing
the
lightest
peccadilloes
as
severely
as
the
greatest
crimes
the
reader
may
compare
in
the
of
political
for
instance
in
une
tenebreuse
affaire
the
curious
differences
subsisting
between
the
criminal
law
of
brumaire
in
the
year
and
that
of
the
code
napoleon
which
has
taken
its
place
in
most
trials
as
in
this
one
the
suspected
persons
are
at
once
examined
and
from
inculpes
become
prevenus
justice
immediately
issues
a
warrant
for
their
arrest
and
imprisonment
in
point
of
fact
in
most
of
such
cases
the
criminals
have
either
fled
or
have
been
instantly
apprehended
indeed
as
we
have
seen
the
police
which
is
but
an
instrument
and
the
officers
of
justice
had
descended
on
esther
s
house
with
the
swiftness
of
a
thunderbolt
even
if
there
had
not
been
the
reasons
for
revenge
suggested
to
the
superior
police
by
corentin
there
was
a
robbery
to
be
investigated
of
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
from
the
baron
de
nucingen
just
as
the
first
prison
van
conveying
jacques
collin
reached
the
archway
of
a
narrow
dark
passage
some
block
ahead
compelled
the
postilion
to
stop
under
the
vault
the
prisoner
s
eyes
shone
like
carbuncles
through
the
grating
in
spite
of
his
aspect
as
of
a
dying
man
which
the
day
before
had
led
the
governor
of
la
force
to
believe
that
the
doctor
must
be
called
in
these
flaming
eyes
free
to
rove
at
this
moment
for
neither
the
officer
nor
the
gendarme
looked
round
at
their
customer
spoke
so
plain
a
language
that
a
clever
examining
judge
popinot
for
instance
would
have
identified
the
man
convicted
for
sacrilege
in
fact
ever
since
the
had
turned
out
of
the
gate
of
la
force
jacques
collin
had
studied
everything
on
his
way
notwithstanding
the
pace
they
had
made
he
took
in
the
houses
with
an
eager
and
comprehensive
glance
from
the
ground
floor
to
the
attics
he
saw
and
noted
every
god
himself
is
not
more
as
to
the
means
and
ends
of
his
creatures
than
this
man
in
observing
the
slightest
differences
in
the
medley
of
things
and
people
armed
with
hope
as
the
last
of
the
horatii
was
armed
with
his
sword
he
expected
help
to
anybody
but
this
machiavelli
of
the
hulks
this
hope
would
have
seemed
so
absolutely
impossible
to
realize
that
he
would
have
gone
on
mechanically
as
all
guilty
men
do
not
one
of
them
ever
dreams
of
resistance
when
he
finds
himself
in
the
position
to
which
justice
and
the
paris
police
bring
suspected
persons
especially
those
who
like
collin
and
lucien
are
in
solitary
confinement
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
the
sudden
isolation
in
which
a
suspected
criminal
is
placed
the
gendarmes
who
apprehend
him
the
commissioner
who
questions
him
those
who
take
him
to
prison
the
warders
who
lead
him
to
his
cell
which
is
actually
called
a
cachot
a
dungeon
or
those
again
who
take
him
by
the
arms
to
put
him
into
a
every
being
that
comes
near
him
from
the
moment
of
his
arrest
is
either
speechless
or
takes
note
of
all
he
says
to
be
repeated
to
the
police
or
to
the
judge
this
total
severance
so
simply
effected
between
the
prisoner
and
the
world
gives
rise
to
a
complete
overthrow
of
his
faculties
and
a
terrible
prostration
of
mind
especially
when
the
man
has
not
been
familiarized
by
his
antecedents
with
the
processes
of
justice
the
duel
between
the
judge
and
the
criminal
is
all
the
more
appalling
because
justice
has
on
its
side
the
dumbness
of
blank
walls
and
the
incorruptible
coldness
of
its
agents
but
jacques
collin
or
carlos
herrera
it
will
be
necessary
to
speak
of
him
by
one
or
the
other
of
these
names
according
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case
had
long
been
familiar
with
the
methods
of
the
police
of
the
jail
and
of
justice
this
colossus
of
cunning
and
corruption
had
employed
all
his
powers
of
mind
and
all
the
resources
of
mimicry
to
affect
the
surprise
and
anility
of
an
innocent
man
while
giving
the
lawyers
the
spectacle
of
his
sufferings
as
has
been
told
asie
that
skilled
locusta
had
given
him
a
dose
of
poison
so
qualified
as
to
produce
the
effects
of
a
dreadful
illness
thus
monsieur
camusot
the
police
commissioner
and
the
public
prosecutor
had
been
baffled
in
their
proceedings
and
inquiries
by
the
effects
apparently
of
an
apoplectic
attack
he
has
taken
poison
cried
monsieur
camusot
horrified
by
the
sufferings
of
the
priest
when
he
had
been
carried
down
from
the
attic
writhing
in
convulsions
four
constables
had
with
great
difficulty
brought
the
abbe
carlos
downstairs
to
esther
s
room
where
the
lawyers
and
the
gendarmes
were
assembled
that
was
the
best
thing
he
could
do
if
he
should
be
guilty
replied
the
public
prosecutor
do
you
believe
that
he
is
ill
the
police
commissioner
asked
the
police
is
always
incredulous
the
three
lawyers
had
spoken
as
may
be
imagined
in
a
whisper
but
jacques
collin
had
guessed
from
their
faces
the
subject
under
discussion
and
had
taken
advantage
of
it
to
make
the
first
brief
examination
which
is
gone
through
on
arrest
absolutely
impossible
and
useless
he
had
stammered
out
sentences
in
which
spanish
and
french
were
so
mingled
as
to
make
nonsense
at
la
force
this
farce
had
been
all
the
more
successful
in
the
first
instance
because
the
head
of
the
safety
force
an
abbreviation
of
the
title
head
of
the
brigade
of
the
guardians
of
public
safety
who
had
long
since
taken
jacques
collin
into
custody
at
madame
vauquer
s
had
been
sent
on
special
business
into
the
country
and
his
deputy
was
a
man
who
hoped
to
succeed
him
but
to
whom
the
convict
was
unknown
himself
formerly
a
convict
and
a
comrade
of
jacques
collin
s
on
the
hulks
was
his
personal
enemy
this
hostility
had
its
rise
in
quarrels
in
which
jacques
collin
had
always
got
the
upper
hand
and
in
the
supremacy
over
his
which
had
always
assumed
and
then
for
ten
years
now
jacques
collin
had
been
the
ruling
providence
of
released
convicts
in
paris
their
head
their
adviser
and
their
banker
and
consequently
s
antagonist
thus
though
placed
in
solitary
confinement
he
trusted
to
the
intelligent
and
unreserved
devotion
of
asie
his
right
hand
and
perhaps
too
to
paccard
his
left
hand
who
as
he
flattered
himself
might
return
to
his
allegiance
when
once
that
thrifty
subaltern
had
safely
bestowed
the
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
that
he
had
stolen
this
was
the
reason
why
his
attention
had
been
so
superhumanly
alert
all
along
the
road
and
strange
to
say
his
hopes
were
about
to
be
amply
fulfilled
the
two
solid
of
the
archway
were
covered
to
a
height
of
six
feet
with
a
permanent
dado
of
mud
formed
of
the
splashes
from
the
gutter
for
in
those
days
the
foot
passenger
had
no
protection
from
the
constant
traffic
of
vehicles
and
from
what
was
called
the
kicking
of
the
carts
but
curbstones
placed
upright
at
intervals
and
much
ground
away
by
the
naves
of
the
wheels
more
than
once
a
heavy
truck
had
crushed
a
heedless
under
that
such
indeed
paris
remained
in
many
districts
and
till
long
after
this
circumstance
may
give
some
idea
of
the
narrowness
of
the
gate
and
the
ease
with
which
it
could
be
blocked
if
a
cab
should
be
coming
through
from
the
place
de
greve
while
a
was
pushing
her
little
truck
of
apples
in
from
the
rue
du
martroi
a
third
vehicle
of
any
kind
produced
difficulties
the
fled
in
alarm
seeking
a
to
protect
them
from
the
axles
which
had
attained
such
prominence
that
a
law
was
passed
at
last
to
reduce
their
length
when
the
prison
van
came
in
this
passage
was
blocked
by
a
market
woman
with
a
costermonger
s
vegetable
cart
one
of
a
type
which
is
all
the
more
strange
because
specimens
still
exist
in
paris
in
spite
of
the
increasing
number
of
shops
she
was
so
thoroughly
a
street
hawker
that
a
sergeant
de
ville
if
that
particular
class
of
police
had
been
then
in
existence
would
have
allowed
her
to
ply
her
trade
without
inspecting
her
permit
in
spite
of
a
sinister
countenance
that
reeked
of
crime
her
head
wrapped
in
a
cheap
and
ragged
checked
cotton
kerchief
was
horrid
with
rebellious
locks
of
hair
like
the
bristles
of
a
wild
boar
her
red
and
wrinkled
neck
was
disgusting
and
her
little
shawl
failed
entirely
to
conceal
a
chest
tanned
brown
by
the
sun
dust
and
mud
her
gown
was
patchwork
her
shoes
gaped
as
though
they
were
grinning
at
a
face
as
full
of
holes
as
the
gown
and
what
an
apron
a
plaster
would
have
been
less
filthy
this
moving
and
fetid
rag
must
have
stunk
in
the
nostrils
of
dainty
folks
ten
yards
away
those
hands
had
gleaned
a
hundred
harvest
fields
either
the
woman
had
returned
from
a
german
witches
sabbath
or
she
had
come
out
of
a
mendicity
asylum
but
what
eyes
what
audacious
intelligence
what
repressed
vitality
when
the
magnetic
flash
of
her
look
and
of
jacques
collin
s
met
to
exchange
a
thought
get
out
of
the
way
you
old
cried
the
postilion
in
harsh
tones
mind
you
don
t
crush
me
you
hangman
s
apprentice
she
retorted
your
cartful
is
not
worth
as
much
as
and
by
trying
to
squeeze
in
between
two
to
make
way
the
hawker
managed
to
block
the
passage
long
enough
to
achieve
her
purpose
oh
asie
said
jacques
collin
to
himself
at
once
recognizing
his
accomplice
then
all
is
the
was
still
exchanging
amenities
with
asie
and
vehicles
were
collecting
in
the
rue
du
martroi
look
out
there
pecaire
fermati
souni
la
vedrem
shrieked
old
asie
with
the
intonations
peculiar
to
these
female
costermongers
who
disfigure
their
words
in
such
a
way
that
they
are
transformed
into
a
sort
onomatopoeia
incomprehensible
to
any
but
parisians
in
the
confusion
in
the
alley
and
among
the
outcries
of
all
the
waiting
drivers
no
one
paid
any
heed
to
this
wild
yell
which
might
have
been
the
woman
s
usual
cry
but
this
gibberish
intelligible
to
jacques
collin
sent
to
his
ear
in
a
mongrel
language
of
their
own
a
mixture
of
bad
italian
and
provencal
this
important
news
your
poor
boy
is
nabbed
i
am
here
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
we
shall
meet
in
the
midst
of
his
joy
at
having
thus
triumphed
over
the
police
for
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
keep
up
communications
jacques
collin
had
a
blow
which
might
have
killed
any
other
man
lucien
in
custody
said
he
to
himself
he
almost
fainted
this
news
was
to
him
more
terrible
than
the
rejection
of
his
appeal
could
have
been
if
he
had
been
condemned
to
death
now
that
both
the
prison
vans
are
rolling
along
the
quai
the
interest
of
this
story
requires
that
i
should
add
a
few
words
about
the
conciergerie
while
they
are
making
their
way
thither
the
conciergerie
a
historical
name
a
terrible
name
a
still
more
terrible
thing
is
inseparable
from
the
revolutions
of
france
and
especially
those
of
paris
it
has
known
most
of
our
great
criminals
but
if
it
is
the
most
interesting
of
the
buildings
of
paris
it
is
also
the
least
known
least
known
to
persons
of
the
upper
classes
still
in
spite
of
the
interest
of
this
historical
digression
it
should
be
as
short
as
the
journey
of
the
prison
vans
what
parisian
what
foreigner
or
what
provincial
can
have
failed
to
observe
the
gloomy
and
mysterious
features
of
the
quai
des
lunettes
a
structure
of
black
walls
flanked
by
three
round
towers
with
conical
roofs
two
of
them
almost
touching
each
other
this
quay
beginning
at
the
pont
du
change
ends
at
the
pont
neuf
a

whence
the
signal
was
given
for
the
massacre
of
a

almost
as
tall
as
that
of
de
la
boucherie
shows
where
the
palais
de
justice
stands
and
forms
the
corner
of
the
quay
these
four
towers
and
these
walls
are
shrouded
in
the
black
winding
sheet
which
in
paris
falls
on
every
facade
to
the
north
about
along
the
quay
at
a
gloomy
archway
we
see
the
beginning
of
the
private
houses
which
were
built
in
consequence
of
the
construction
of
the
pont
neuf
in
the
reign
of
henry
iv
the
place
royale
was
a
replica
of
the
place
dauphine
the
style
of
architecture
is
the
same
of
brick
with
binding
courses
of
hewn
stone
this
archway
and
the
rue
de
harlay
are
the
limit
line
of
the
palais
de
justice
on
the
west
formerly
the
prefecture
de
police
once
the
residence
of
the
presidents
of
parlement
was
a
dependency
of
the
palace
the
court
of
exchequer
and
court
of
subsidies
completed
the
supreme
court
of
justice
the
sovereign
s
court
it
will
be
seen
that
before
the
revolution
the
palace
enjoyed
that
isolation
which
now
again
is
aimed
at
this
block
this
island
of
residences
and
official
buildings
in
their
midst
the
that
priceless
jewel
of
chaplet
is
the
sanctuary
of
paris
its
holy
place
its
sacred
ark
for
one
thing
this
island
was
at
first
the
whole
of
the
city
for
the
plot
now
forming
the
place
dauphine
was
a
meadow
attached
to
the
royal
demesne
where
stood
a
stamping
mill
for
coining
money
hence
the
name
of
rue
de
la
monnaie
the
street
leading
to
the
pont
neuf
hence
too
the
name
of
one
of
the
round
towers
the
middle
one
called
the
tour
d
argent
which
would
seem
to
show
that
money
was
originally
coined
there
the
famous
mill
to
be
seen
marked
in
old
maps
of
paris
may
very
likely
be
more
recent
than
the
time
when
money
was
coined
in
the
palace
itself
and
was
erected
no
doubt
for
the
practice
of
improved
methods
in
the
art
of
coining
the
first
tower
hardly
detached
from
the
tour
d
argent
is
the
tour
de
montgomery
the
third
and
smallest
but
the
best
preserved
of
the
three
for
it
still
has
its
battlements
is
the
tour
bonbec
the
and
its
four
towers
counting
the
clock
tower
as
one
clearly
define
the
precincts
or
as
a
surveyor
would
say
the
perimeter
of
the
palace
as
it
was
from
the
time
of
the
merovingians
till
the
accession
of
the
first
race
of
valois
but
to
us
as
a
result
of
certain
alterations
this
palace
is
more
especially
representative
of
the
period
of
charles
was
the
first
to
give
the
palace
up
to
the
parlement
then
a
new
institution
and
went
to
reside
in
the
famous
hotel
under
the
protection
of
the
bastille
the
palais
des
tournelles
was
subsequently
erected
backing
on
to
the
hotel
thus
under
the
later
valois
the
kings
came
back
from
the
bastille
to
the
louvre
which
had
been
their
first
stronghold
the
original
residence
of
the
french
kings
the
palace
of
which
has
preserved
the
designation
of
le
palais
to
indicate
the
palace
of
palaces
is
entirely
buried
under
the
palais
de
justice
it
forms
the
cellars
for
it
was
built
like
the
cathedral
in
the
seine
and
with
such
care
that
the
highest
floods
in
the
river
scarcely
cover
the
lowest
steps
the
quai
de
l
horloge
covers
twenty
feet
below
the
surface
its
foundations
of
a
thousand
years
old
carriages
run
on
the
level
of
the
capitals
of
the
solid
columns
under
these
towers
and
formerly
their
appearance
must
have
harmonized
with
the
elegance
of
the
palace
and
have
had
a
picturesque
effect
over
the
water
since
to
this
day
those
towers
vie
in
height
with
the
loftiest
buildings
in
paris
as
we
look
down
on
this
vast
capital
from
the
lantern
of
the
pantheon
the
palace
with
the
is
still
the
most
monumental
of
many
monumental
buildings
the
home
of
our
kings
over
which
you
tread
as
you
pace
the
immense
hall
known
as
the
des
was
a
miracle
of
architecture
and
it
is
so
still
to
the
intelligent
eye
of
the
poet
who
happens
to
study
it
when
inspecting
the
conciergerie
alas
for
the
conciergerie
has
invaded
the
home
of
kings
one
s
heart
bleeds
to
see
the
way
in
which
cells
cupboards
corridors
warders
rooms
and
halls
devoid
of
light
or
air
have
been
hewn
out
of
that
beautiful
structure
in
which
byzantine
gothic
and
romanesque
the
three
phases
of
ancient
art
were
harmonized
in
one
building
by
the
architecture
of
the
twelfth
century
this
palace
is
a
monumental
history
of
france
in
the
earliest
times
just
as
blois
is
that
of
a
later
period
as
at
blois
you
may
admire
in
a
single
courtyard
the
chateau
of
the
counts
of
blois
that
of
louis
that
of
francis
that
of
gaston
so
at
the
conciergerie
you
will
find
within
the
same
precincts
the
stamp
of
the
early
races
and
in
the
the
architecture
of
municipal
council
to
you
i
speak
if
you
bestow
millions
get
a
poet
or
two
to
assist
your
architects
if
you
wish
to
save
the
cradle
of
paris
the
cradle
of
kings
while
endeavoring
to
endow
paris
and
the
supreme
court
with
a
palace
worthy
of
france
it
is
a
matter
for
study
for
some
years
before
beginning
the
work
another
new
prison
or
two
like
that
of
la
roquette
and
the
palace
of
will
be
safe
in
these
days
many
grievances
afflict
this
vast
mass
of
buildings
buried
under
the
palais
de
justice
and
the
quay
like
some
antediluvian
creature
in
the
soil
of
montmartre
but
the
worst
affliction
is
that
it
is
the
conciergerie
this
epigram
is
intelligible
in
the
early
days
of
the
monarchy
noble
criminals
for
the
villeins
a
word
signifying
the
peasantry
in
french
and
english
alike
and
the
citizens
came
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
municipality
or
of
their
liege
lord
the
lords
of
the
greater
or
the
lesser
fiefs
were
brought
before
the
king
and
guarded
in
the
conciergerie
and
as
these
noble
criminals
were
few
the
conciergerie
was
large
enough
for
the
king
s
prisoners
it
is
difficult
now
to
be
quite
certain
of
the
exact
site
of
the
original
conciergerie
however
the
kitchens
built
by
still
exist
forming
what
is
now
called
the
mousetrap
and
it
is
probable
that
the
original
conciergerie
was
situated
in
the
place
where
till
the
conciergerie
prisons
of
the
parlement
were
still
in
use
under
the
archway
to
the
right
of
the
wide
outside
steps
leading
to
the
supreme
court
from
thence
until
condemned
criminals
were
taken
to
execution
from
that
gate
came
forth
all
the
great
criminals
all
the
victims
of
political
feeling
the
marechale
d
ancre
and
the
queen
of
france
semblancay
and
malesherbes
damien
and
danton
desrues
and
castaing
s
private
room
like
that
of
the
public
prosecutor
now
was
so
placed
that
he
could
see
the
procession
of
carts
containing
the
persons
whom
the
revolutionary
tribunal
had
sentenced
to
death
thus
this
man
who
had
become
a
sword
could
give
a
last
glance
at
each
batch
after
when
monsieur
de
peyronnet
was
minister
a
great
change
was
made
in
the
palais
the
old
entrance
to
the
conciergerie
where
the
ceremonies
of
registering
the
criminal
and
of
the
last
toilet
were
performed
was
closed
and
removed
to
where
it
now
is
between
the
tour
de
l
horloge
and
the
tour
de
montgomery
in
an
inner
court
entered
through
an
arched
passage
to
the
left
is
the
mousetrap
to
the
right
the
prison
gates
the
can
drive
into
this
irregularly
shaped
courtyard
can
stand
there
and
turn
with
ease
and
in
case
of
a
riot
find
some
protection
behind
the
strong
grating
of
the
gate
under
the
arch
whereas
they
formerly
had
no
room
to
move
in
the
narrow
space
dividing
the
outside
steps
from
the
right
wing
of
the
palace
in
our
day
the
conciergerie
hardly
large
enough
for
the
prisoners
committed
for
trial
room
being
needed
for
about
three
hundred
men
and
women
no
longer
receives
either
suspected
or
remanded
criminals
excepting
in
rare
cases
as
for
instance
in
these
of
jacques
collin
and
lucien
all
who
are
imprisoned
there
are
committed
for
trial
before
the
bench
as
an
exception
criminals
of
the
higher
ranks
are
allowed
to
sojourn
there
since
being
already
disgraced
by
a
sentence
in
open
court
their
punishment
would
be
too
severe
if
they
served
their
term
of
imprisonment
at
melun
or
at
poissy
ouvrard
preferred
to
be
imprisoned
at
the
conciergerie
rather
than
at
at
this
moment
of
writing
lehon
the
notary
and
the
prince
de
bergues
are
serving
their
time
there
by
an
exercise
of
leniency
which
though
arbitrary
is
humane
as
a
rule
suspected
criminals
whether
they
are
to
be
subjected
to
a
preliminary
examination
to
go
up
in
the
slang
of
the
courts
or
to
appear
before
the
magistrate
of
the
lower
court
are
transferred
in
prison
vans
direct
to
the
the
mousetraps
opposite
the
gate
consist
of
a
certain
number
of
old
cells
constructed
in
the
old
kitchens
of
building
whither
prisoners
not
yet
fully
committed
are
brought
to
await
the
hour
when
the
court
sits
or
the
arrival
of
the
examining
judge
the
mousetraps
end
on
the
north
at
the
quay
on
the
east
at
the
headquarters
of
the
municipal
guard
on
the
west
at
the
courtyard
of
the
conciergerie
and
on
the
south
they
adjoin
a
large
vaulted
hall
formerly
no
doubt
the
but
at
present
disused
above
the
mousetraps
is
an
inner
guardroom
with
a
window
commanding
the
court
of
the
conciergerie
this
is
used
by
the
gendarmerie
of
the
department
and
the
stairs
lead
up
to
it
when
the
hour
of
trial
strikes
the
sheriffs
call
the
roll
of
the
prisoners
the
gendarmes
go
down
one
for
each
prisoner
and
each
gendarme
takes
a
criminal
by
the
arm
and
thus
in
couples
they
mount
the
stairs
cross
the
guardroom
and
are
led
along
the
passages
to
a
room
contiguous
to
the
hall
where
sits
the
famous
sixth
chamber
of
the
law
whose
functions
are
those
of
an
english
county
court
the
same
road
is
trodden
by
the
prisoners
committed
for
trial
on
their
way
to
and
from
the
conciergerie
and
the
assize
court
in
the
des
between
the
door
into
the
first
court
of
the
inferior
class
and
the
steps
leading
to
the
sixth
the
visitor
must
observe
the
first
time
he
goes
there
a
doorway
without
a
door
or
any
architectural
adornment
a
square
hole
of
the
meanest
type
through
this
the
judges
and
barristers
find
their
way
into
the
passages
into
the
guardhouse
down
into
the
prison
cells
and
to
the
entrance
to
the
conciergerie
the
private
chambers
of
all
the
examining
judges
are
on
different
floors
in
this
part
of
the
building
they
are
reached
by
squalid
staircases
a
maze
in
which
those
to
whom
the
place
is
unfamiliar
inevitably
lose
themselves
the
windows
of
some
look
out
on
the
quay
others
on
the
yard
of
the
conciergerie
in
a
few
of
these
rooms
commanded
the
rue
de
la
barillerie
thus
when
a
prison
van
turns
to
the
left
in
this
yard
it
has
brought
prisoners
to
be
examined
to
the
mousetrap
when
it
turns
to
the
right
it
conveys
prisoners
committed
for
trial
to
the
conciergerie
now
it
was
to
the
right
that
the
vehicle
turned
which
conveyed
jacques
collin
to
set
him
down
at
the
prison
gate
nothing
can
be
more
sinister
prisoners
and
visitors
see
two
barred
gates
of
wrought
iron
with
a
space
between
them
of
about
six
feet
these
are
never
both
opened
at
once
and
through
them
everything
is
so
cautiously
scrutinized
that
persons
who
have
a
visiting
ticket
pass
the
permit
through
the
bars
before
the
key
grinds
in
the
lock
the
examining
judges
or
even
the
supreme
judges
are
not
admitted
without
being
identified
imagine
then
the
chances
of
communications
or
escape
the
governor
of
the
conciergerie
would
smile
with
an
expression
on
his
lips
that
would
freeze
the
mere
suggestion
in
the
most
daring
of
romancers
who
defy
probability
in
all
the
annals
of
the
conciergerie
no
escape
has
been
known
but
that
of
lavalette
but
the
certain
fact
of
august
connivance
now
amply
proven
if
it
does
not
detract
from
the
wife
s
devotion
certainly
diminished
the
risk
of
failure
the
most
ardent
lover
of
the
marvelous
judging
on
the
spot
of
the
nature
of
the
difficulties
must
admit
that
at
all
times
the
obstacles
must
have
been
as
they
still
are
insurmountable
no
words
can
do
justice
to
the
strength
of
the
walls
and
vaulting
they
must
be
seen
though
the
pavement
of
the
yard
is
on
a
lower
level
than
that
of
the
quay
in
crossing
this
barbican
you
go
down
several
steps
to
enter
an
immense
vaulted
hall
with
solid
walls
graced
with
magnificent
columns
this
hall
abuts
on
the
tour
de
montgomery
which
is
now
part
of
the
governor
s
residence
and
on
the
tour
d
argent
serving
as
a
dormitory
for
the
warders
or
porters
or
turnkeys
as
you
may
prefer
to
call
them
the
number
of
the
officials
is
less
than
might
be
supposed
there
are
but
twenty
their
sleeping
quarters
like
their
beds
are
in
no
respect
different
from
those
of
the
or
private
cells
the
name
originated
no
doubt
in
the
fact
that
the
prisoners
formerly
paid
a
pistole
about
ten
francs
a
week
for
this
accommodation
its
bareness
resembling
that
of
the
empty
garrets
in
which
great
men
in
poverty
begin
their
career
in
paris
to
the
left
in
the
vast
entrance
hall
sits
the
governor
of
the
conciergerie
in
a
sort
of
office
constructed
of
glass
panes
where
he
and
his
clerk
keep
the
here
the
prisoners
for
examination
or
committed
for
trial
have
their
names
entered
with
a
full
description
and
are
then
searched
the
question
of
their
lodging
is
also
settled
this
depending
on
the
prisoner
s
means
opposite
the
entrance
to
this
hall
there
is
a
glass
door
this
opens
into
a
parlor
where
the
prisoner
s
relations
and
his
counsel
may
speak
with
him
across
a
double
grating
of
wood
the
parlor
window
opens
on
to
the
prison
yard
the
inner
court
where
prisoners
committed
for
trial
take
air
and
exercise
at
certain
fixed
hours
this
large
hall
only
lighted
by
the
doubtful
daylight
that
comes
in
through
the
gates
for
the
single
window
to
the
front
court
is
screened
by
the
glass
office
built
out
in
front
of
it
has
an
atmosphere
and
a
gloom
that
strike
the
eye
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
pictures
that
force
themselves
on
the
imagination
its
aspect
is
all
the
more
sinister
because
parallel
with
the
tours
d
argent
and
de
montgomery
you
discover
those
mysterious
vaulted
and
overwhelming
crypts
which
lead
to
the
cells
occupied
by
the
queen
and
madame
elizabeth
and
to
those
known
as
the
secret
cells
this
maze
of
masonry
after
being
of
old
the
scene
of
royal
festivities
is
now
the
basement
of
the
palais
de
justice
between
and
the
operation
of
the
last
toilet
was
performed
in
this
enormous
hall
between
a
large
stove
which
heats
it
and
the
inner
gate
it
is
impossible
even
now
to
tread
without
a
shudder
on
the
paved
floor
that
has
received
the
shock
and
the
confidences
of
so
many
last
glances
the
apparently
dying
victim
on
this
occasion
could
not
get
out
of
the
horrible
vehicle
without
the
assistance
of
two
gendarmes
who
took
him
under
the
arms
to
support
him
and
led
him
half
unconscious
into
the
office
thus
dragged
along
the
dying
man
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
in
such
a
way
as
to
suggest
a
resemblance
to
the
saviour
taken
down
from
the
cross
and
certainly
in
no
picture
does
jesus
present
a
more
cadaverous
or
tortured
countenance
than
this
of
the
sham
spaniard
he
looked
ready
to
breathe
his
last
sigh
as
soon
as
he
was
seated
in
the
office
he
repeated
in
a
weak
voice
the
speech
he
had
made
to
everybody
since
he
was
arrested
i
appeal
to
his
excellency
the
spanish
you
can
say
that
to
the
examining
judge
replied
the
governor
oh
lord
said
jacques
collin
with
a
sigh
but
can
not
i
have
a
breviary
shall
i
never
be
allowed
to
see
a
doctor
i
have
not
two
hours
to
as
carlos
herrera
was
to
be
placed
in
close
confinement
in
the
secret
cells
it
was
needless
to
ask
him
whether
he
claimed
the
benefits
of
the
pistole
as
above
described
that
is
to
say
the
right
of
having
one
of
the
rooms
where
the
prisoner
enjoys
such
comfort
as
the
law
permits
these
rooms
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
of
which
mention
will
presently
be
made
the
sheriff
and
the
clerk
calmly
carried
out
the
formalities
of
the
consignment
to
prison
monsieur
said
jacques
collin
to
the
governor
in
broken
french
i
am
as
you
see
a
dying
man
pray
if
you
can
tell
that
examining
judge
as
soon
as
possible
that
i
crave
as
a
favor
what
a
criminal
must
most
dread
namely
to
be
brought
before
him
as
soon
as
he
arrives
for
my
sufferings
are
really
unbearable
and
as
soon
as
i
see
him
the
mistake
will
be
cleared
up
as
an
universal
rule
every
criminal
talks
of
a
mistake
go
to
the
hulks
and
question
the
convicts
they
are
almost
all
victims
of
a
miscarriage
of
justice
so
this
speech
raises
a
faint
smile
in
all
who
come
into
contact
with
the
suspected
accused
or
condemned
criminal
i
will
mention
your
request
to
the
examining
judge
replied
the
governor
and
i
shall
bless
you
monsieur
replied
the
false
abbe
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
as
soon
as
his
name
was
entered
on
the
calendar
carlos
herrera
supported
under
each
arm
by
a
man
of
the
municipal
guard
and
followed
by
a
turnkey
instructed
by
the
governor
as
to
the
number
of
the
cell
in
which
the
prisoner
was
to
be
placed
was
led
through
the
subterranean
maze
of
the
conciergerie
into
a
perfectly
wholesome
room
whatever
certain
philanthropists
may
say
to
the
contrary
but
cut
off
from
all
possible
communication
with
the
outer
world
as
soon
as
he
was
removed
the
warders
the
governor
and
his
clerk
looked
at
each
other
as
though
asking
each
other
s
opinion
and
suspicion
was
legible
on
every
face
but
at
the
appearance
of
the
second
man
in
custody
the
spectators
relapsed
into
their
usual
doubting
frame
of
mind
concealed
under
the
air
of
indifference
only
in
very
extraordinary
cases
do
the
functionaries
of
the
conciergerie
feel
any
curiosity
the
prisoners
are
no
more
to
them
than
a
barber
s
customers
are
to
him
hence
all
the
formalities
which
appall
the
imagination
are
carried
out
with
less
fuss
than
a
money
transaction
at
a
banker
s
and
often
with
greater
civility
lucien
s
expression
was
that
of
a
dejected
criminal
he
submitted
to
everything
and
obeyed
like
a
machine
all
the
way
from
fontainebleau
the
poet
had
been
facing
his
ruin
and
telling
himself
that
the
hour
of
expiation
had
tolled
pale
and
exhausted
knowing
nothing
of
what
had
happened
at
esther
s
house
during
his
absence
he
only
knew
that
he
was
the
intimate
ally
of
an
escaped
convict
a
situation
which
enabled
him
to
guess
at
disaster
worse
than
death
when
his
mind
could
command
a
thought
it
was
that
of
suicide
he
must
at
any
cost
escape
the
ignominy
that
loomed
before
him
like
the
phantasm
of
a
dreadful
dream
jacques
collin
as
the
more
dangerous
of
the
two
culprits
was
placed
in
a
cell
of
solid
masonry
deriving
its
light
from
one
of
the
narrow
yards
of
which
there
are
several
in
the
interior
of
the
palace
in
the
wing
where
the
public
prosecutor
s
chambers
are
this
little
yard
is
the
for
the
female
prisoners
lucien
was
taken
to
the
same
part
of
the
building
to
a
cell
adjoining
the
rooms
let
to
misdemeanants
for
by
orders
from
the
examining
judge
the
governor
treated
him
with
some
consideration
persons
who
have
never
had
anything
to
do
with
the
action
of
the
law
usually
have
the
darkest
notions
as
to
the
meaning
of
solitary
or
secret
confinement
ideas
as
to
the
treatment
of
criminals
have
not
yet
become
disentangled
from
the
old
pictures
of
torture
chambers
of
the
unhealthiness
of
a
prison
the
chill
of
stone
walls
sweating
tears
the
coarseness
of
the
jailers
and
of
the
food
inevitable
accessories
of
the
drama
but
it
is
not
unnecessary
to
explain
here
that
these
exaggerations
exist
only
on
the
stage
and
only
make
lawyers
and
judges
smile
as
well
as
those
who
visit
prisons
out
of
curiosity
or
who
come
to
study
them
for
a
long
time
no
doubt
they
were
terrible
in
the
days
of
the
old
parlement
of
louis
xiii
and
louis
the
accused
were
no
doubt
flung
into
a
low
room
underneath
the
old
gateway
the
prisons
were
among
the
crimes
of
and
it
is
enough
only
to
see
the
cells
where
the
queen
and
madame
elizabeth
were
incarcerated
to
conceive
a
horror
of
old
judicial
proceedings
in
our
day
though
philanthropy
has
brought
incalculable
mischief
on
society
it
has
produced
some
good
for
the
individual
it
is
to
napoleon
that
we
owe
our
criminal
code
and
this
even
more
than
the
civil
code
which
still
urgently
needs
reform
on
some
points
will
remain
one
of
the
greatest
monuments
of
his
short
reign
this
new
view
of
criminal
law
put
an
end
to
a
perfect
abyss
of
misery
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
apart
from
the
terrible
moral
torture
which
men
of
the
better
classes
must
suffer
when
they
find
themselves
in
the
power
of
the
law
the
action
of
that
power
is
simple
and
mild
to
a
degree
that
would
hardly
be
expected
suspected
or
accused
criminals
are
certainly
not
lodged
as
if
they
were
at
home
but
every
necessary
is
supplied
to
them
in
the
prisons
of
paris
besides
the
burden
of
feelings
that
weighs
on
them
deprives
the
details
of
daily
life
of
their
customary
value
it
is
never
the
body
that
suffers
the
mind
is
in
such
a
phase
of
violence
that
every
form
of
discomfort
or
of
brutal
treatment
if
such
there
were
would
be
easily
endured
in
such
a
frame
of
mind
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
an
innocent
man
is
quickly
released
especially
in
paris
so
lucien
on
entering
his
cell
saw
an
exact
reproduction
of
the
first
room
he
had
occupied
in
paris
at
the
hotel
cluny
a
bed
to
compare
with
those
in
the
worst
furnished
apartments
of
the
quartier
latin
straw
chairs
with
the
bottoms
out
a
table
and
a
few
utensils
compose
the
furniture
of
such
a
room
in
which
two
accused
prisoners
are
not
unfrequently
placed
together
when
they
are
quiet
in
their
ways
and
their
misdeeds
are
not
crimes
of
violence
but
such
as
forgery
or
bankruptcy
this
resemblance
between
his
in
the
days
of
his
innocency
and
his
goal
the
lowest
depths
of
degradation
and
sham
was
so
direct
an
appeal
to
his
last
chord
of
poetic
feeling
that
the
unhappy
fellow
melted
into
tears
for
four
hours
he
wept
as
rigid
in
appearance
as
a
figure
of
stone
but
enduring
the
subversion
of
all
his
hopes
the
crushing
of
all
his
social
vanity
and
the
utter
overthrow
of
his
pride
smarting
in
each
separate
that
exists
in
an
ambitious
man
a
lover
a
success
a
dandy
a
parisian
a
poet
a
libertine
and
a
favorite
everything
in
him
was
broken
by
this
fall
as
of
icarus
carlos
herrera
on
the
other
hand
as
soon
as
he
was
locked
into
his
cell
and
found
himself
alone
began
pacing
it
to
and
fro
like
the
polar
bear
in
his
cage
he
carefully
examined
the
door
and
assured
himself
that
with
the
exception
of
the
peephole
there
was
not
a
crack
in
it
he
sounded
all
the
walls
he
looked
up
the
funnel
down
which
a
dim
light
came
and
he
said
to
himself
i
am
safe
enough
he
sat
down
in
a
corner
where
the
eye
of
a
prying
warder
at
the
grating
of
the
peephole
could
not
see
him
then
he
took
off
his
wig
and
hastily
ungummed
a
piece
of
paper
that
did
duty
as
lining
the
side
of
the
paper
next
his
head
was
so
greasy
that
it
looked
like
the
very
texture
of
the
wig
if
it
had
occurred
to
to
snatch
off
the
wig
to
establish
the
identity
of
the
spaniard
with
jacques
collin
he
would
never
have
thought
twice
about
the
paper
it
looked
so
exactly
like
part
of
the
wigmaker
s
work
the
other
side
was
still
fairly
white
and
clean
enough
to
have
a
few
lines
written
on
it
the
delicate
and
tiresome
task
of
unsticking
it
had
been
begun
in
la
force
two
hours
would
not
have
been
long
enough
it
had
taken
him
half
of
the
day
before
the
prisoner
began
by
tearing
this
precious
scrap
of
paper
so
as
to
have
a
strip
four
or
five
lines
wide
which
he
divided
into
several
bits
he
then
replaced
his
store
of
paper
in
the
same
strange
after
damping
the
gummed
side
so
as
to
make
it
stick
again
he
felt
in
a
lock
of
his
hair
for
one
of
those
pencil
leads
as
thin
as
a
stout
pin
then
recently
invented
by
susse
and
which
he
had
put
in
with
some
gum
he
broke
off
a
scrap
long
enough
to
write
with
and
small
enough
to
hide
in
his
ear
having
made
these
preparations
with
the
rapidity
and
certainty
of
hand
peculiar
to
old
convicts
who
are
as
as
monkeys
jacques
collin
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
to
meditate
on
his
instructions
to
asie
in
perfect
confidence
that
he
should
come
across
her
so
entirely
did
he
rely
on
the
woman
s
genius
during
the
preliminary
examination
he
reflected
i
pretended
to
be
a
spaniard
and
spoke
broken
french
appealed
to
my
ambassador
and
alleged
diplomatic
privilege
not
understanding
anything
i
was
asked
the
whole
performance
varied
by
fainting
pauses
sighs
in
short
all
the
vagaries
of
a
dying
man
i
must
stick
to
that
my
papers
are
all
regular
asie
and
i
can
eat
up
monsieur
camusot
he
is
no
great
shakes
now
i
must
think
of
lucien
he
must
be
made
to
pull
himself
together
i
must
get
at
the
boy
at
whatever
cost
and
show
him
some
plan
of
conduct
otherwise
he
will
give
himself
up
give
me
up
lose
all
he
must
be
taught
his
lesson
before
he
is
examined
and
besides
i
must
find
some
witnesses
to
swear
to
my
being
a
priest
such
was
the
position
moral
and
physical
of
these
two
prisoners
whose
fate
at
the
moment
depended
on
monsieur
camusot
examining
judge
to
the
inferior
court
of
the
seine
and
sovereign
master
during
the
time
granted
to
him
by
the
code
of
the
smallest
details
of
their
existence
since
he
alone
could
grant
leave
for
them
to
be
visited
by
the
chaplains
the
doctor
or
any
one
else
in
the
world
no
human
authority
neither
the
king
nor
the
keeper
of
the
seals
nor
the
prime
minister
can
encroach
on
the
power
of
an
examining
judge
nothing
can
stop
him
no
one
can
control
him
he
is
a
monarch
subject
only
to
his
conscience
and
the
law
at
the
present
time
when
philosophers
philanthropists
and
politicians
are
constantly
endeavoring
to
reduce
every
social
power
the
rights
conferred
on
the
examining
judges
have
become
the
object
of
attacks
that
are
all
the
more
serious
because
they
are
almost
justified
by
those
rights
which
it
must
be
owned
are
enormous
and
yet
as
every
man
of
sense
will
own
that
power
ought
to
remain
unimpaired
in
certain
cases
its
exercise
can
be
mitigated
by
a
strong
infusion
of
caution
but
society
is
already
threatened
by
the
ineptitude
and
weakness
of
the
jury
which
is
in
fact
the
really
supreme
bench
and
which
ought
to
be
composed
only
of
choice
and
elected
men
and
it
would
be
in
danger
of
ruin
if
this
pillar
were
broken
which
now
upholds
our
criminal
procedure
arrest
on
suspicion
is
one
of
the
terrible
but
necessary
powers
of
which
the
risk
to
society
is
counterbalanced
by
its
immense
importance
and
besides
distrust
of
the
magistracy
in
general
is
a
beginning
of
social
dissolution
destroy
that
institution
and
reconstruct
it
on
another
basis
insist
as
was
the
case
before
the
revolution
that
judges
should
show
a
large
guarantee
of
fortune
but
at
any
cost
believe
in
it
do
not
make
it
an
image
of
society
to
be
insulted
in
these
days
a
judge
paid
as
a
functionary
and
generally
a
poor
man
has
in
the
place
of
his
dignity
of
old
a
haughtiness
of
demeanor
that
seems
odious
to
the
men
raised
to
be
his
equals
for
haughtiness
is
dignity
without
a
solid
basis
that
is
the
vicious
element
in
the
present
system
if
france
were
divided
into
ten
circuits
the
magistracy
might
be
reinstated
by
conferring
its
dignities
on
men
of
fortune
but
with
circuits
this
is
impossible
the
only
real
improvement
to
be
insisted
on
in
the
exercise
of
the
power
intrusted
to
the
examining
judge
is
an
alteration
in
the
conditions
of
preliminary
imprisonment
the
mere
fact
of
suspicion
ought
to
make
no
difference
in
the
habits
of
life
of
the
suspected
parties
houses
of
detention
for
them
ought
to
be
constructed
in
paris
furnished
and
arranged
in
such
a
way
as
greatly
to
modify
the
feeling
of
the
public
with
regard
to
suspected
persons
the
law
is
good
and
is
necessary
its
application
is
in
fault
and
public
feeling
judges
the
laws
from
the
way
in
which
they
are
carried
out
and
public
opinion
in
france
condemns
persons
under
suspicion
while
by
an
inexplicable
reaction
it
justifies
those
committed
for
trial
this
perhaps
is
a
result
of
the
essentially
refractory
nature
of
the
french
this
illogical
temper
of
the
parisian
people
was
one
of
the
factors
which
contributed
to
the
climax
of
this
drama
nay
as
may
be
seen
it
was
one
of
the
most
important
to
enter
into
the
secret
of
the
terrible
scenes
which
are
acted
out
in
the
examining
judge
s
chambers
to
understand
the
respective
positions
of
the
two
belligerent
powers
the
law
and
the
examinee
the
object
of
whose
contest
is
a
certain
secret
kept
by
the
prisoner
from
the
inquisition
of
the
magistrate
well
named
in
prison
slang
the
curious
man
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
persons
imprisoned
under
suspicion
know
nothing
of
what
is
being
said
by
the
seven
or
eight
publics
that
compose
nothing
of
how
much
the
police
know
or
the
authorities
or
the
little
that
newspapers
can
publish
as
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
thus
to
give
a
man
in
custody
such
information
as
jacques
collin
had
just
received
from
asie
as
to
lucien
s
arrest
is
throwing
a
rope
to
a
drowning
man
as
will
be
seen
in
consequence
of
this
ignorance
a
stratagem
which
without
this
warning
must
certainly
have
been
equally
fatal
to
the
convict
was
doomed
to
failure
monsieur
camusot
the
of
one
of
the
clerks
of
the
cabinet
too
well
known
for
any
account
of
his
position
and
connection
to
be
necessary
here
was
at
this
moment
almost
as
much
perplexed
as
carlos
herrera
in
view
of
the
examination
he
was
to
conduct
he
had
formerly
been
president
of
a
court
of
the
paris
circuit
he
had
been
raised
from
that
position
and
called
to
be
a
judge
in
paris
one
of
the
most
coveted
posts
in
the
magistracy
by
the
influence
of
the
celebrated
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
whose
husband
attached
to
the
dauphin
s
person
and
colonel
of
a
cavalry
regiment
of
the
guards
was
as
much
in
favor
with
the
king
as
she
was
with
madame
in
return
for
a
very
small
service
which
he
had
done
the
duchess
an
important
matter
to
her
on
occasion
of
a
charge
of
forgery
brought
against
the
young
comte
d
esgrignon
by
a
banker
of
alencon
see
cabinet
des
de
la
vie
de
he
was
promoted
from
being
a
provincial
judge
to
be
president
of
his
court
and
from
being
president
to
being
an
examining
judge
in
paris
for
eighteen
months
now
he
had
sat
on
the
most
important
bench
in
the
kingdom
and
had
once
at
the
desire
of
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
had
an
opportunity
of
forwarding
the
ends
of
a
lady
not
less
influential
than
the
duchess
namely
the
marquise
d
espard
but
he
had
failed
see
the
in
lucien
as
was
told
at
the
beginning
of
the
scene
to
be
revenged
on
madame
d
espard
who
aimed
at
depriving
her
husband
of
his
liberty
of
action
was
able
to
put
the
true
facts
before
the
public
prosecutor
and
the
comte
de
serizy
these
two
important
authorities
being
thus
won
over
to
the
marquis
d
espard
s
party
his
wife
had
barely
escaped
the
censure
of
the
bench
by
her
husband
s
generous
intervention
on
hearing
yesterday
of
lucien
s
arrest
the
marquise
d
espard
had
sent
her
the
chevalier
d
espard
to
see
madame
camusot
madame
camusot
had
set
off
forthwith
to
call
on
the
notorious
marquise
just
before
dinner
on
her
return
home
she
had
called
her
husband
aside
in
the
bedroom
if
you
can
commit
that
little
fop
lucien
de
rubempre
for
trial
and
secure
his
condemnation
said
she
in
his
ear
you
will
be
councillor
to
the
supreme
court
how
madame
d
espard
longs
to
see
that
poor
young
man
guillotined
i
shivered
as
i
heard
what
a
pretty
woman
s
hatred
can
be
do
not
meddle
in
questions
of
the
law
said
camusot
i
meddle
said
she
if
a
third
person
could
have
heard
us
he
could
not
have
guessed
what
we
were
talking
about
the
marquise
and
i
were
as
exquisitely
hypocritical
to
each
other
as
you
are
to
me
at
this
moment
she
began
by
thanking
me
for
your
good
offices
in
her
suit
saying
that
she
was
grateful
in
spite
of
its
having
failed
she
spoke
of
the
terrible
functions
devolved
on
you
by
the
law
it
is
fearful
to
have
to
send
a
man
to
the
scaffold
but
as
to
that
man
it
would
be
no
more
than
justice
and
so
forth
then
she
lamented
that
such
a
handsome
young
fellow
brought
to
paris
by
her
cousin
madame
du
chatelet
should
have
turned
out
so
badly
that
said
she
is
what
bad
women
like
coralie
and
esther
bring
young
men
to
when
they
are
corrupt
enough
to
share
their
disgraceful
profits
next
came
some
fine
speeches
about
charity
and
religion
madame
du
chatelet
had
said
that
lucien
deserved
a
thousand
deaths
for
having
half
killed
his
mother
and
his
sister
then
she
spoke
of
a
vacancy
in
the
supreme
court
she
knows
the
keeper
of
the
seals
your
husband
madame
has
a
fine
opportunity
of
distinguishing
himself
she
said
in
conclusion
and
that
is
we
distinguish
ourselves
every
day
when
we
do
our
duty
said
camusot
you
will
go
far
if
you
are
always
the
lawyer
even
to
your
wife
cried
madame
camusot
well
i
used
to
think
you
a
goose
now
i
admire
the
lawyer
s
lips
wore
one
of
those
smiles
which
are
as
peculiar
to
them
as
dancers
smiles
are
to
dancers
madame
can
i
come
in
said
the
maid
what
is
it
said
her
mistress
madame
the
head
lady
came
from
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
while
you
were
out
and
she
will
be
obliged
if
you
would
go
at
once
to
the
hotel
de
keep
dinner
back
said
the
lawyer
s
wife
remembering
that
the
driver
of
the
hackney
coach
that
had
brought
her
home
was
waiting
to
be
paid
she
put
her
bonnet
on
again
got
into
the
coach
and
in
twenty
minutes
was
at
the
hotel
de
cadignan
madame
camusot
was
led
up
the
private
stairs
and
sat
alone
for
ten
minutes
in
a
boudoir
adjoining
the
duchess
bedroom
the
duchess
presently
appeared
splendidly
dressed
for
she
was
starting
for
in
obedience
to
a
royal
invitation
between
you
and
me
my
dear
a
few
words
are
yes
madame
la
lucien
de
rubempre
is
in
custody
your
husband
is
conducting
the
inquiry
i
will
answer
for
the
poor
boy
s
innocence
see
that
he
is
released
within
this
is
not
all
some
one
will
ask
to
see
lucien
in
private
in
his
cell
your
husband
may
be
present
if
he
chooses
so
long
as
he
is
not
discovered
the
king
looks
for
high
courage
in
his
magistrates
in
the
difficult
position
in
which
he
will
presently
find
himself
i
will
bring
your
husband
forward
and
recommend
him
as
a
man
devoted
to
the
king
even
at
the
risk
of
his
head
our
friend
camusot
will
be
made
first
a
councillor
and
then
the
president
of
court
somewhere
or
i
am
under
orders
you
will
excuse
me
i
know
you
will
not
only
oblige
the
public
prosecutor
who
can
not
give
an
opinion
in
this
affair
you
will
save
the
life
of
a
dying
woman
madame
de
serizy
so
you
will
not
lack
support
in
short
you
see
i
put
my
trust
in
you
i
need
not
say
you
know
she
laid
a
finger
to
her
lips
and
disappeared
and
i
had
not
a
chance
of
telling
her
that
madame
d
espard
wants
to
see
lucien
on
the
scaffold
thought
the
judge
s
wife
as
she
returned
to
her
hackney
cab
she
got
home
in
such
a
state
of
anxiety
that
her
husband
on
seeing
her
asked
what
is
the
matter
amelie
we
stand
between
two
she
told
her
husband
of
her
interview
with
the
duchess
speaking
in
his
ear
for
fear
the
maid
should
be
listening
at
the
door
now
which
of
them
has
the
most
power
she
said
in
conclusion
the
marquise
was
very
near
getting
you
into
trouble
in
the
silly
business
of
the
commission
on
her
husband
and
we
owe
everything
to
the
duchess
one
made
vague
promises
while
the
other
tells
you
you
shall
first
be
councillor
and
then
heaven
forbid
i
should
advise
you
i
will
never
meddle
in
matters
of
business
still
i
am
bound
to
repeat
exactly
what
is
said
at
court
and
what
goes
on
but
amelie
you
do
not
know
what
the
prefet
of
police
sent
me
this
morning
and
by
whom
by
one
of
the
most
important
agents
of
the
superior
police
the
of
politics
who
told
me
that
the
government
had
a
secret
interest
in
this
now
let
us
dine
and
go
to
the
varietes
we
will
talk
all
this
over
in
my
private
room
for
i
shall
need
your
intelligence
that
of
a
judge
may
not
perhaps
be
enough
nine
magistrates
out
of
ten
would
deny
the
influence
of
the
wife
over
her
husband
in
such
cases
but
though
this
may
be
a
remarkable
exception
in
society
it
may
be
insisted
on
as
true
even
if
improbable
the
magistrate
is
like
the
priest
especially
in
paris
where
the
best
of
the
profession
are
to
be
found
he
rarely
speaks
of
his
business
in
the
courts
excepting
of
settled
cases
not
only
do
magistrates
wives
affect
to
know
nothing
they
have
enough
sense
of
propriety
to
understand
that
it
would
damage
their
husbands
if
when
they
are
told
some
secret
they
allowed
their
knowledge
to
be
suspected
nevertheless
on
some
great
occasions
when
promotion
depends
on
the
decision
taken
many
a
wife
like
amelie
has
helped
the
lawyer
in
his
study
of
a
case
and
after
all
these
exceptions
which
of
course
are
easily
denied
since
they
remain
unknown
depend
entirely
on
the
way
in
which
the
struggle
between
two
natures
has
worked
out
in
now
madame
camusot
controlled
her
husband
completely
when
all
in
the
house
were
asleep
the
lawyer
and
his
wife
sat
down
to
the
desk
where
the
magistrate
had
already
laid
out
the
documents
in
the
case
here
are
the
notes
forwarded
to
me
at
my
request
by
the
prefet
of
police
said
camusot
abbe
carlos
this
individual
is
undoubtedly
the
man
named
jacques
collin
known
as
who
was
last
arrested
in
in
the
of
a
certain
madame
vauquer
who
kept
a
common
in
the
rue
where
he
lived
in
concealment
under
the
alias
of
a
marginal
note
in
the
prefet
s
handwriting
ran
thus
orders
have
been
sent
by
telegraph
to
chief
of
the
safety
department
to
return
forthwith
to
be
confronted
with
the
prisoner
as
he
is
personally
acquainted
with
jacques
collin
whom
he
in
fact
arrested
in
with
the
connivance
of
a
mademoiselle
michonneau
the
boarders
who
then
lived
in
the
maison
vauquer
are
still
living
and
may
be
called
to
establish
his
identity
the
carlos
herrera
is
monsieur
lucien
de
rubempre
s
intimate
friend
and
adviser
and
for
three
years
past
has
furnished
him
with
considerable
sums
evidently
obtained
by
dishonest
means
this
partnership
if
the
identity
of
the
spaniard
with
jacques
collin
can
be
proved
must
involve
the
condemnation
of
lucien
de
rubempre
the
sudden
death
of
peyrade
the
police
agent
is
attributable
to
poison
administered
at
the
instigation
of
jacques
collin
rubempre
or
their
accomplices
the
reason
for
this
murder
is
the
fact
that
justice
had
for
a
long
time
been
on
the
traces
of
these
clever
and
again
on
the
margin
the
magistrate
pointed
to
this
note
written
by
the
prefet
himself
this
is
the
fact
to
my
personal
knowledge
and
i
also
know
that
the
sieur
lucien
de
rubempre
has
disgracefully
tricked
the
comte
de
serizy
and
the
public
what
do
you
say
to
this
amelie
it
is
frightful
repled
his
wife
go
the
transformation
of
the
convict
jacques
collin
into
a
spanish
priest
is
the
result
of
some
crime
more
clever
than
that
by
which
coignard
made
himself
comte
de
de
lucien
chardon
son
of
an
apothecary
at
angouleme
his
mother
a
demoiselle
de
rubempre
bears
the
name
of
rubempre
in
virtue
of
a
royal
patent
this
was
granted
by
the
request
of
madame
la
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
and
monsieur
le
comte
de
serizy
this
young
man
came
to
paris
in
without
any
means
of
subsistence
following
madame
la
comtesse
sixte
du
chatelet
then
madame
de
bargeton
a
cousin
of
madame
d
espard
s
he
was
ungrateful
to
madame
de
bargeton
and
cohabited
with
a
girl
named
coralie
an
actress
at
the
gymnase
now
dead
who
left
monsieur
camusot
a
silk
mercer
in
the
rue
des
bourdonnais
to
live
with
rubempre
ere
long
having
sunk
into
poverty
through
the
insufficiency
of
the
money
allowed
him
by
this
actress
he
seriously
compromised
his
a
highly
respected
printer
of
angouleme
by
giving
forged
bills
for
which
david
sechard
was
arrested
during
a
short
visit
paid
to
angouleme
by
lucien
in
consequence
of
this
affair
rubempre
fled
but
suddenly
reappeared
in
paris
with
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
though
having
no
visible
means
of
subsistence
the
said
lucien
de
rubempre
spent
on
an
average
three
hundred
thousand
francs
during
the
three
years
of
his
second
residence
in
paris
and
can
only
have
obtained
the
money
from
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
but
how
did
he
come
by
it
he
has
recently
laid
out
above
a
million
francs
in
repurchasing
the
rubempre
estates
to
fulfil
the
conditions
on
which
he
was
to
be
allowed
to
marry
mademoiselle
clotilde
de
grandlieu
this
marriage
has
been
broken
off
in
consequence
of
inquiries
made
by
the
grandlieu
family
the
said
lucien
having
told
them
that
he
had
obtained
the
money
from
his
and
his
sister
but
the
information
obtained
more
especially
by
monsieur
derville
proves
that
not
only
were
that
worthy
couple
ignorant
of
his
having
made
this
purchase
but
that
they
believed
the
said
lucien
to
be
deeply
in
debt
moreover
the
property
inherited
by
the
sechards
consists
of
houses
and
the
ready
money
by
their
affidavit
amounted
to
about
two
hundred
thousand
francs
lucien
was
secretly
cohabiting
with
esther
gobseck
hence
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
all
the
lavish
gifts
of
the
baron
de
nucingen
the
girl
s
protector
were
handed
over
to
the
said
lucien
lucien
and
his
companion
the
convict
have
succeeded
in
keeping
their
footing
in
the
face
of
the
world
longer
than
coignard
did
deriving
their
income
from
the
prostitution
of
the
said
esther
formerly
on
the
register
of
the
though
these
notes
are
to
a
great
extent
a
repetition
of
the
story
already
told
it
was
necessary
to
reproduce
them
to
show
the
part
played
by
the
police
in
paris
as
has
already
been
seen
from
the
note
on
peyrade
the
police
has
summaries
almost
invariably
correct
concerning
every
family
or
individual
whose
life
is
under
suspicion
or
whose
actions
are
of
a
doubtful
character
it
knows
every
circumstance
of
their
delinquencies
this
universal
register
and
account
of
consciences
is
as
accurately
kept
as
the
register
of
the
bank
of
france
and
its
accounts
of
fortunes
just
as
the
bank
notes
the
slightest
delay
in
payment
gauges
every
credit
takes
stock
of
every
capitalist
and
watches
their
proceedings
so
does
the
police
weigh
and
measure
the
honesty
of
each
citizen
with
it
as
in
a
court
of
law
innocence
has
nothing
to
fear
it
has
no
hold
on
anything
but
crime
however
high
the
rank
of
a
family
it
can
not
evade
this
social
providence
and
its
discretion
is
equal
to
the
extent
of
its
power
this
vast
mass
of
written
evidence
compiled
by
the
police
reports
notes
and
summaries
an
ocean
of
information
sleeps
undisturbed
as
deep
and
calm
as
the
sea
some
accident
occurs
some
crime
or
misdemeanor
becomes
aggressive
then
the
law
refers
to
the
police
and
immediately
if
any
documents
bear
on
the
suspected
criminal
the
judge
is
informed
these
records
an
analysis
of
his
antecedents
are
merely
and
unknown
beyond
the
walls
of
the
palais
de
justice
no
legal
use
can
be
made
of
them
justice
is
informed
by
them
and
takes
advantage
of
them
but
that
is
all
these
documents
form
as
it
were
the
inner
lining
of
the
tissue
of
crimes
their
first
cause
which
is
hardly
ever
made
public
no
jury
would
accept
it
and
the
whole
country
would
rise
up
in
wrath
if
excerpts
from
those
documents
came
out
in
the
trial
at
the
assizes
in
fact
it
is
the
truth
which
is
doomed
to
remain
in
the
well
as
it
is
everywhere
and
at
all
times
there
is
not
a
magistrate
who
after
twelve
years
experience
in
paris
is
not
fully
aware
that
the
assize
court
and
the
police
authorities
keep
the
secret
of
half
these
squalid
atrocities
or
who
does
not
admit
that
half
the
crimes
that
are
committed
are
never
punished
by
the
law
if
the
public
could
know
how
reserved
the
of
the
police
are
who
do
not
forget
they
would
reverence
these
honest
men
as
much
as
they
do
cheverus
the
police
is
supposed
to
be
astute
machiavellian
it
is
in
fact
most
benign
but
it
hears
every
passion
in
its
paroxysms
it
listens
to
every
kind
of
treachery
and
keeps
notes
of
all
the
police
is
terrible
on
one
side
only
what
it
does
for
justice
it
does
no
less
for
political
interests
but
in
these
it
is
as
ruthless
and
as
as
the
fires
of
the
inquisition
put
this
aside
said
the
lawyer
replacing
the
notes
in
their
cover
this
is
a
secret
between
the
police
and
the
law
the
judge
will
estimate
its
value
but
monsieur
and
madame
camusot
must
know
nothing
of
as
if
i
needed
telling
that
said
his
wife
lucien
is
guilty
he
went
on
but
of
what
a
man
who
is
the
favorite
of
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse

and
loved
by
clotilde
de
grandlieu
is
not
guilty
said
amelie
the
other
be
answerable
for
but
lucien
is
his
accomplice
cried
camusot
take
my
advice
said
amelie
restore
this
priest
to
the
diplomatic
career
he
so
greatly
adorns
exculpate
this
little
wretch
and
find
some
other
criminal
how
you
run
on
said
the
magistrate
with
a
smile
women
go
to
the
point
plunging
through
the
law
as
birds
fly
through
the
air
and
find
nothing
to
stop
but
said
amelie
whether
he
is
a
diplomate
or
a
convict
the
abbe
carlos
will
find
some
one
to
get
him
out
of
the
i
am
only
a
considering
cap
you
are
the
brain
said
camusot
well
the
sitting
is
closed
give
your
melie
a
kiss
it
is
one
o
and
madame
camusot
went
to
bed
leaving
her
husband
to
arrange
his
papers
and
his
ideas
in
preparation
for
the
task
of
examining
the
two
prisoners
next
morning
and
thus
while
the
prison
vans
were
conveying
jacques
collin
and
lucien
to
the
conciergerie
the
examining
judge
having
breakfasted
was
making
his
way
across
paris
on
foot
after
the
unpretentious
fashion
of
parisian
magistrates
to
go
to
his
chambers
where
all
the
documents
in
the
case
were
laid
ready
for
him
this
was
the
way
of
it
every
examining
judge
has
a
a
sort
of
sworn
legal
secretary
a
race
that
perpetuates
itself
without
any
premiums
or
encouragement
producing
a
number
of
excellent
souls
in
whom
secrecy
is
natural
and
incorruptible
from
the
origin
of
the
parlement
to
the
present
day
no
case
has
ever
been
known
at
the
palais
de
justice
of
any
gossip
or
indiscretion
on
the
part
of
a
clerk
bound
to
the
courts
of
inquiry
gentil
sold
the
release
given
by
louise
de
savoie
to
semblancay
a
war
office
clerk
sold
the
plan
of
the
russian
campaign
to
czernitchef
and
these
traitors
were
more
or
less
rich
the
prospect
of
a
post
in
the
palais
and
professional
conscientiousness
are
enough
to
make
a
judge
s
clerk
a
successful
rival
of
the
tomb
for
the
tomb
has
betrayed
many
secrets
since
chemistry
has
made
such
progress
this
official
is
in
fact
the
magistrate
s
pen
it
will
be
understood
by
many
readers
that
a
man
may
gladly
be
the
shaft
of
a
machine
while
they
wonder
why
he
is
content
to
remain
a
bolt
still
a
bolt
is
content
perhaps
the
machinery
terrifies
him
camusot
s
clerk
a
young
man
of
named
coquart
had
come
in
the
morning
to
fetch
all
the
documents
and
the
judge
s
notes
and
laid
everything
ready
in
his
chambers
while
the
lawyer
himself
was
wandering
along
the
quays
looking
at
the
curiosities
in
the
shops
and
wondering
within
himself
how
on
earth
am
i
to
set
to
work
with
such
a
clever
rascal
as
this
jacques
collin
supposing
it
is
he
the
head
of
the
safety
will
know
him
i
must
look
as
if
i
knew
what
i
was
about
if
only
for
the
sake
of
the
police
i
see
so
many
insuperable
difficulties
that
the
best
plan
would
be
to
enlighten
the
marquise
and
the
duchess
by
showing
them
the
notes
of
the
police
and
i
should
avenge
my
father
from
whom
lucien
stole
if
i
can
unveil
these
scoundrels
my
skill
will
be
loudly
proclaimed
and
lucien
will
soon
be
thrown
over
by
his
well
well
the
examination
will
settle
all
he
turned
into
a
curiosity
shop
tempted
by
a
boule
clock
not
to
be
false
to
my
conscience
and
yet
to
oblige
two
great
ladies
that
will
be
a
triumph
of
skill
thought
he
what
do
you
collect
coins
too
monsieur
said
camusot
to
the
public
prosecutor
whom
he
found
in
the
shop
it
is
a
taste
dear
to
all
dispensers
of
justice
said
the
comte
de
granville
laughing
they
look
at
the
reverse
side
of
every
and
after
looking
about
the
shop
for
some
minutes
as
if
continuing
his
search
he
accompanied
camusot
on
his
way
down
the
quay
without
it
ever
occurring
to
camusot
that
anything
but
chance
had
brought
them
together
you
are
examining
monsieur
de
rubempre
this
morning
said
the
public
prosecutor
poor
fellow
i
liked
there
are
several
charges
against
him
said
camusot
yes
i
saw
the
police
papers
but
some
of
the
information
came
from
an
agent
who
is
independent
of
the
prefet
the
notorious
corentin
who
had
caused
the
death
of
more
innocent
men
than
you
will
ever
send
guilty
men
to
the
scaffold
and
but
that
rascal
is
out
of
your
without
trying
to
influence
the
conscience
of
such
a
magistrate
as
you
are
i
may
point
out
to
you
that
if
you
could
be
perfectly
sure
that
lucien
was
ignorant
of
the
contents
of
that
woman
s
will
it
would
be
that
he
had
no
interest
in
her
death
for
she
gave
him
enormous
sums
of
we
can
prove
his
absence
at
the
time
when
this
esther
was
poisoned
said
camusot
he
was
at
fontainebleau
on
the
watch
for
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
and
the
duchesse
de
and
he
still
cherished
such
hopes
of
marrying
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
said
the
public
prosecutor
i
have
it
from
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
herself
that
it
is
inconceivable
that
such
a
clever
young
fellow
should
compromise
his
chances
by
a
perfectly
aimless
yes
said
camusot
especially
if
esther
gave
him
all
she
derville
and
nucingen
both
say
that
she
died
in
ignorance
of
the
inheritance
she
had
long
since
come
into
added
granville
but
then
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
asked
camusot
for
there
is
something
at
the
bottom
of
a
crime
committed
by
some
servant
said
the
public
prosecutor
unfortunately
remarked
camusot
it
would
be
quite
like
jacques
collin
for
the
spanish
priest
is
certainly
none
other
than
that
escaped
convict
to
have
taken
possession
of
the
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
derived
from
the
sale
of
the
certificate
of
shares
given
to
esther
by
weigh
everything
with
care
my
dear
camusot
be
prudent
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
has
diplomatic
connections
still
an
envoy
who
had
committed
a
crime
would
not
be
sheltered
by
his
position
is
he
or
is
he
not
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
that
is
the
important
and
monsieur
de
granville
bowed
and
turned
away
as
requiring
no
answer
so
he
too
wants
to
save
lucien
thought
camusot
going
on
by
the
quai
des
lunettes
while
the
public
prosecutor
entered
the
palais
through
the
cour
de
harlay
on
reaching
the
courtyard
of
the
conciergerie
camusot
went
to
the
governor
s
room
and
led
him
into
the
middle
of
the
pavement
where
no
one
could
overhear
them
my
dear
sir
do
me
the
favor
of
going
to
la
force
and
inquiring
of
your
colleague
there
whether
he
happens
at
this
moment
to
have
there
any
convicts
who
were
on
the
hulks
at
toulon
between
and
or
have
you
any
imprisoned
here
we
will
transfer
those
of
la
force
here
for
a
few
days
and
you
will
let
me
know
whether
this
spanish
priest
is
known
to
them
as
jacques
collin
otherwise
very
good
monsieur
but
is
come
what
already
said
the
judge
he
was
at
melun
he
was
told
that
had
to
be
identified
and
he
smiled
with
joy
he
awaits
your
send
him
to
the
governor
was
then
able
to
lay
before
monsieur
camusot
jacques
collin
s
request
and
he
described
the
man
s
deplorable
condition
i
intended
to
examine
him
first
replied
the
magistrate
but
not
on
account
of
his
health
i
received
a
note
this
morning
from
the
governor
of
la
force
well
this
rascal
who
described
himself
to
you
as
having
been
dying
for
hours
past
slept
so
soundly
that
they
went
into
his
cell
there
with
the
doctor
for
whom
the
governor
had
sent
without
his
hearing
them
the
doctor
did
not
even
feel
his
pulse
he
left
him
to
sleep
which
proves
that
his
conscience
is
as
tough
as
his
health
i
shall
accept
this
feigned
illness
only
so
far
as
it
may
enable
me
to
study
my
man
added
monsieur
camusot
smiling
we
live
to
learn
every
day
with
these
various
grades
of
prisoners
said
the
governor
of
the
prison
the
prefecture
of
police
adjoins
the
conciergerie
and
the
magistrates
like
the
governor
knowing
all
the
subterranean
passages
can
get
to
and
fro
with
the
greatest
rapidity
this
explains
the
miraculous
ease
with
which
information
can
be
conveyed
during
the
sitting
of
the
courts
to
the
officials
and
the
presidents
of
the
assize
courts
and
by
the
time
monsieur
camusot
had
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
leading
to
his
chambers
was
there
too
having
come
by
the
des
what
zeal
said
camusot
with
a
smile
ah
well
you
see
if
it
is
replied
the
man
you
will
see
great
fun
in
the
if
by
chance
there
are
any
old
stagers
why
sneaked
their
chips
and
i
know
that
they
have
vowed
to
be
the
death
of
were
the
convicts
whose
money
intrusted
to
had
all
been
made
away
with
by
him
for
lucien
as
has
been
told
could
you
lay
your
hand
on
the
witnesses
of
his
former
arrest
give
me
two
summonses
of
witnesses
and
i
will
find
you
some
coquart
said
the
lawyer
as
he
took
off
his
gloves
and
placed
his
hat
and
stick
in
a
corner
fill
up
two
summonses
by
monsieur
s
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
over
the
chimney
shelf
where
stood
in
the
place
of
a
clock
a
basin
and
jug
on
one
side
was
a
bottle
of
water
and
a
glass
on
the
other
a
lamp
he
rang
the
bell
his
usher
came
in
a
few
minutes
after
is
anybody
here
for
me
yet
he
asked
the
man
whose
business
it
was
to
receive
the
witnesses
to
verify
their
summons
and
to
set
them
in
the
order
of
their
arrival
yes
take
their
names
and
bring
me
the
the
examining
judges
to
save
time
are
often
obliged
to
carry
on
several
inquiries
at
once
hence
the
long
waiting
inflicted
on
the
witnesses
who
have
seats
in
the
ushers
hall
where
the
judges
bells
are
constantly
ringing
and
then
camusot
went
on
bring
up
the
abbe
carlos
ah
ha
i
was
told
that
he
was
a
priest
in
spanish
pooh
it
is
a
new
edition
of
collet
monsieur
camusot
said
the
head
of
the
safety
department
there
is
nothing
new
replied
camusot
and
he
signed
the
two
formidable
documents
which
alarm
everybody
even
the
most
innocent
witnesses
whom
the
law
thus
requires
to
appear
under
severe
penalties
in
case
of
failure
by
this
time
jacques
collin
had
about
half
an
hour
since
finished
his
deep
meditations
and
was
armed
for
the
fray
nothing
is
more
perfectly
characteristic
of
this
type
of
the
mob
in
rebellion
against
the
law
than
the
few
words
he
had
written
on
the
greasy
scraps
of
paper
the
sense
of
the
first
for
it
was
written
in
the
language
the
very
slang
of
slang
agreed
upon
by
asie
and
himself
a
cipher
of
words
was
as
follows
go
to
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
or
madame
de
serizy
one
of
them
must
see
lucien
before
he
is
examined
and
give
him
the
enclosed
paper
to
read
then
find
europe
and
paccard
those
two
thieves
must
be
at
my
orders
and
ready
to
play
any
part
i
may
set
them
go
to
rastignac
tell
him
from
the
man
he
met
at
the
to
come
and
swear
that
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
has
no
resemblance
to
jacques
collin
who
was
apprehended
at
vauquer
s
do
the
same
with
bianchon
and
get
lucien
s
two
women
to
work
to
the
same
on
the
enclosed
fragment
were
these
words
in
good
french
lucien
confess
nothing
about
me
i
am
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
not
only
will
this
be
your
exculpation
but
if
you
do
not
lose
your
head
you
will
have
seven
millions
and
your
honor
these
two
bits
of
paper
gummed
on
the
side
of
the
writing
so
as
to
look
like
one
piece
were
then
rolled
tightly
with
a
dexterity
peculiar
to
men
who
have
dreamed
of
getting
free
from
the
hulks
the
whole
thing
assumed
the
shape
and
consistency
of
a
ball
of
dirty
rubbish
about
as
big
as
the
heads
which
thrifty
women
stick
on
the
head
of
a
large
needle
when
the
eye
is
broken
if
i
am
examined
first
we
are
saved
if
it
is
the
boy
all
is
lost
said
he
to
himself
while
he
waited
his
plight
was
so
sore
that
the
strong
man
s
face
was
wet
with
white
sweat
indeed
this
wonderful
man
saw
as
clearly
in
his
sphere
of
crime
as
moliere
did
in
his
sphere
of
dramatic
poetry
or
cuvier
in
that
of
extinct
organisms
genius
of
whatever
kind
is
intuition
below
this
highest
manifestation
other
remarkable
achievements
may
be
due
to
talent
this
is
what
divides
men
of
the
first
rank
from
those
of
the
second
crime
has
its
men
of
genius
jacques
collin
driven
to
bay
had
hit
on
the
same
notion
as
madame
camusot
s
ambition
and
madame
de
serizy
s
passion
suddenly
revived
by
the
shock
of
the
dreadful
disaster
which
was
overwhelming
lucien
this
was
the
supreme
effort
of
human
intellect
directed
against
the
steel
armor
of
justice
on
hearing
the
rasping
of
the
heavy
locks
and
bolts
of
his
door
jacques
collin
resumed
his
mask
of
a
dying
man
he
was
helped
in
this
by
the
intoxicating
joy
that
he
felt
at
the
sound
of
the
warder
s
shoes
in
the
passage
he
had
no
idea
how
asie
would
get
near
him
but
he
relied
on
meeting
her
on
the
way
especially
after
her
promise
given
in
the
gateway
after
that
fortunate
achievement
she
had
gone
on
to
the
place
de
greve
till
the
name
of
la
greve
the
strand
had
a
meaning
that
is
now
lost
every
part
of
the
from
the
pont
d
arcole
to
the
pont
was
then
as
nature
had
made
it
excepting
the
paved
way
which
was
at
the
top
of
the
bank
when
the
river
was
in
flood
a
boat
could
pass
close
under
the
houses
and
at
the
end
of
the
streets
running
down
to
the
river
on
the
quay
the
footpath
was
for
the
most
part
raised
with
a
few
steps
and
when
the
river
was
up
to
the
houses
vehicles
had
to
pass
along
the
horrible
rue
de
la
mortellerie
which
has
now
been
completely
removed
to
make
room
for
enlarging
the
hotel
de
ville
so
the
sham
costermonger
could
easily
and
quickly
run
her
truck
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
quay
and
hide
it
there
till
the
real
owner
who
was
in
fact
drinking
the
price
of
her
wares
sold
bodily
to
asie
in
one
of
the
abominable
taverns
in
the
rue
de
la
mortellerie
should
return
to
claim
it
at
that
time
the
quai
pelletier
was
being
extended
the
entrance
to
the
works
was
guarded
by
a
crippled
soldier
and
the
barrow
would
be
quite
safe
in
his
keeping
asie
then
jumped
into
a
hackney
cab
on
the
place
de
l
hotel
de
ville
and
said
to
the
driver
to
the
temple
and
look
sharp
i
ll
tip
you
a
woman
dressed
like
asie
could
disappear
without
any
questions
being
asked
in
the
huge
where
all
the
rags
in
paris
are
gathered
together
where
a
thousand
costermongers
wander
round
and
two
hundred
sellers
are
chaffering
the
two
prisoners
had
hardly
been
locked
up
when
she
was
dressing
herself
in
a
low
damp
entresol
over
one
of
those
foul
shops
where
remnants
are
sold
pieces
stolen
by
tailors
and
dressmakers
an
establishment
kept
by
an
old
maid
known
as
la
romette
from
her
christian
name
jeromette
la
romette
was
to
the
purchasers
of
wardrobes
what
these
women
are
to
the
better
class
of
ladies

difficulties
madame
la
ressource
that
is
to
say
at
a
hundred
per
cent
now
child
said
asie
i
have
got
to
be
figged
out
i
must
be
a
baroness
of
the
faubourg
at
the
very
least
and
sharp
s
the
word
for
my
feet
are
in
hot
oil
you
know
what
gowns
suit
me
hand
up
the
find
me
some
bits
of
lace
and
the
swaggerest
jewelry
you
can
pick
send
the
girl
to
call
a
coach
and
have
it
brought
to
the
back
yes
madame
the
woman
replied
very
humbly
and
with
the
eagerness
of
a
maid
waiting
on
her
mistress
if
there
had
been
any
one
to
witness
the
scene
he
would
have
understood
that
the
woman
known
as
asie
was
at
home
here
i
have
had
some
diamonds
offered
me
said
la
romette
as
she
dressed
asie
s
head
stolen
i
should
think
well
then
however
cheap
they
may
be
we
must
do
without
em
we
must
fight
shy
of
the
beak
for
a
long
time
to
it
will
now
be
understood
how
asie
contrived
to
be
in
the
des
of
the
palais
de
justice
with
a
summons
in
her
hand
asking
her
way
along
the
passages
and
stairs
leading
to
the
examining
judge
s
chambers
and
inquiring
for
monsieur
camusot
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
that
gentleman
s
arrival
asie
was
not
recognizable
after
washing
off
her
as
an
old
woman
like
an
actress
she
applied
rouge
and
pearl
powder
and
covered
her
head
with
a
fair
wig
dressed
exactly
as
a
lady
of
the
faubourg
might
be
if
in
search
of
a
dog
she
had
lost
she
looked
about
forty
for
she
shrouded
her
features
under
a
splendid
black
lace
veil
a
pair
of
stays
severely
laced
disguised
her
cook
s
figure
with
very
good
gloves
and
a
rather
large
bustle
she
exhaled
the
perfume
of
powder
a
la
marechale
playing
with
a
bag
mounted
in
gold
she
divided
her
attention
between
the
walls
of
the
building
where
she
found
herself
evidently
for
the
first
time
and
the
string
by
which
she
led
a
dainty
little
spaniel
such
a
dowager
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
natives
of
the
des
besides
the
briefless
lawyers
who
sweep
this
hall
with
their
gowns
and
speak
of
the
leading
advocates
by
their
christian
names
as
fine
gentlemen
address
each
other
to
produce
the
impression
that
they
are
of
the
aristocracy
of
the
law
patient
youths
are
often
to
be
seen
of
the
attorneys
waiting
waiting
in
hope
of
a
case
put
down
for
the
end
of
the
day
which
they
may
be
so
lucky
as
to
be
called
to
plead
if
the
advocates
retained
for
the
earlier
cases
should
not
come
out
in
time
a
very
curious
study
would
be
that
of
the
differences
between
these
various
black
gowns
pacing
the
immense
hall
in
threes
or
sometimes
in
fours
their
persistent
talk
filling
the
place
with
a
loud
echoing
hum
a
hall
well
named
indeed
for
this
slow
walk
exhausts
the
lawyers
as
much
as
the
waste
of
words
but
such
a
study
has
its
place
in
the
volumes
destined
to
reveal
the
life
of
paris
pleaders
asie
had
counted
on
the
presence
of
these
youths
she
laughed
in
her
sleeve
at
some
of
the
pleasantries
she
overheard
and
finally
succeeded
in
attracting
the
attention
of
massol
a
young
lawyer
whose
time
was
more
taken
up
by
the
than
by
clients
and
who
came
up
with
a
laugh
to
place
himself
at
the
service
of
a
woman
so
elegantly
scented
and
so
handsomely
dressed
asie
put
on
a
little
thin
voice
to
explain
to
this
obliging
gentleman
that
she
appeared
in
answer
to
a
summons
from
a
judge
named
camusot
oh
in
the
rubempre
case
so
the
affair
had
its
name
already
oh
it
is
not
my
affair
it
is
my
maid
s
a
girl
named
europe
who
was
with
me
hours
and
who
fled
when
she
saw
my
servant
bring
in
a
piece
of
stamped
then
like
any
old
woman
who
spends
her
life
gossiping
in
the
prompted
by
massol
she
poured
out
the
story
of
her
woes
with
her
first
husband
one
of
the
three
directors
of
the
land
revenue
she
consulted
the
young
lawyer
as
to
whether
she
would
do
well
to
enter
on
a
lawsuit
with
her
the
comte
de
who
made
her
daughter
very
miserable
and
whether
the
law
allowed
her
to
dispose
of
her
fortune
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
massol
could
not
be
sure
whether
the
summons
were
addressed
to
the
mistress
or
the
maid
at
the
first
moment
he
had
only
glanced
at
this
legal
document
of
the
most
familiar
aspect
for
to
save
time
it
is
printed
and
the
magistrates
clerks
have
only
to
fill
in
the
blanks
left
for
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
witnesses
the
hour
for
which
they
are
called
and
so
forth
asie
made
him
tell
her
all
about
the
palais
which
she
knew
more
intimately
than
the
lawyer
did
finally
she
inquired
at
what
hour
monsieur
camusot
would
arrive
well
the
examining
judges
generally
are
here
by
about
ten
o
it
is
now
a
quarter
to
ten
said
she
looking
at
a
pretty
little
watch
a
perfect
gem
of
goldsmith
s
work
which
made
massol
say
to
himself
where
the
devil
will
fortune
make
herself
at
home
next
at
this
moment
asie
had
come
to
the
dark
hall
looking
out
on
the
yard
of
the
conciergerie
where
the
ushers
wait
on
seeing
the
gate
through
the
window
she
exclaimed
what
are
those
high
walls
that
is
the
oh
so
that
is
the
conciergerie
where
our
poor
queen
oh
i
should
so
like
to
see
her
cell
impossible
madame
la
baronne
replied
the
young
lawyer
on
whose
arm
the
dowager
was
now
leaning
a
permit
is
indispensable
and
very
difficult
to
i
have
been
told
she
went
on
that
louis
xviii
himself
composed
the
inscription
that
is
to
be
seen
in
s
yes
madame
la
how
much
i
should
like
to
know
latin
that
i
might
study
the
words
of
that
inscription
said
she
do
you
think
that
monsieur
camusot
could
give
me
a
permit
that
is
not
in
his
power
but
he
could
take
you
but
his
business
objected
she
oh
said
massol
prisoners
under
suspicion
can
to
be
sure
said
she
artlessly
they
are
under
but
i
know
monsieur
de
granville
your
public
prosecutor
this
hint
had
a
magical
effect
on
the
ushers
and
the
young
lawyer
ah
you
know
monsieur
de
granville
said
massol
who
was
inclined
to
ask
the
client
thus
sent
to
him
by
chance
her
name
and
address
i
often
see
him
at
my
friend
monsieur
de
serizy
s
house
madame
de
serizy
is
a
connection
of
mine
through
the
well
if
madame
wishes
to
go
down
to
the
conciergerie
said
an
usher
she
yes
said
massol
so
the
baroness
and
the
lawyer
were
allowed
to
pass
and
they
presently
found
themselves
in
the
little
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
leading
to
the
mousetrap
a
spot
well
known
to
asie
forming
as
has
been
said
a
post
of
observation
between
those
cells
and
the
court
of
the
sixth
chamber
through
which
everybody
is
obliged
to
pass
will
you
ask
if
monsieur
camusot
is
come
yet
said
she
seeing
some
gendarmes
playing
cards
yes
madame
he
has
just
come
up
from
the
the
mousetrap
said
she
what
is
that
oh
how
stupid
of
me
not
to
have
gone
straight
to
the
comte
de
but
i
have
not
time
now
pray
take
me
to
speak
to
monsieur
camusot
before
he
is
otherwise
oh
you
have
plenty
of
time
for
seeing
monsieur
camusot
said
massol
if
you
send
him
in
your
card
he
will
spare
you
the
discomfort
of
waiting
in
the
with
the
we
can
be
civil
here
to
ladies
like
you
have
a
card
about
you
at
this
instant
asie
and
her
lawyer
were
exactly
in
front
of
the
window
of
the
guardroom
whence
the
gendarmes
could
observe
the
gate
of
the
conciergerie
the
gendarmes
brought
up
to
respect
the
defenders
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
were
aware
too
of
the
prerogative
of
the
gown
and
for
a
few
minutes
allowed
the
baroness
to
remain
there
escorted
by
a
pleader
asie
listened
to
the
terrible
tales
which
a
young
lawyer
is
ready
to
tell
about
that
she
would
not
believe
that
those
who
were
condemned
to
death
were
prepared
for
the
scaffold
behind
those
bars
but
the
assured
her
it
was
so
how
much
i
should
like
to
see
it
done
cried
she
and
there
she
remained
prattling
to
the
lawyer
and
the
sergeant
till
she
saw
jacques
collin
come
out
supported
by
two
gendarmes
and
preceded
by
monsieur
camusot
s
clerk
ah
there
is
a
chaplain
no
doubt
going
to
prepare
a
poor
wretch
not
at
all
madame
la
baronne
said
the
gendarme
he
is
a
prisoner
coming
to
be
what
is
he
accused
of
he
is
concerned
in
this
poisoning
oh
i
should
like
to
see
you
can
not
stay
here
said
the
sergeant
for
he
is
under
close
arrest
and
he
must
pass
through
here
you
see
madame
that
door
leads
to
the
stairs
oh
thank
you
cried
the
baroness
making
for
the
door
to
rush
down
the
stairs
where
she
at
once
shrieked
out
oh
where
am
i
this
cry
reached
the
ear
of
jacques
collin
who
was
thus
prepared
to
see
her
the
sergeant
flew
after
madame
la
baronne
seized
her
by
the
middle
and
lifted
her
back
like
a
feather
into
the
midst
of
a
group
of
five
gendarmes
who
started
up
as
one
man
for
in
that
guardroom
everything
is
regarded
as
suspicious
the
proceeding
was
arbitrary
but
the
arbitrariness
was
necessary
the
young
lawyer
himself
had
cried
out
twice
madame
madame
in
his
horror
so
much
did
he
fear
finding
himself
in
the
wrong
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
half
fainting
sank
on
a
chair
in
the
guardroom
poor
man
said
the
baroness
can
he
be
a
criminal
the
words
though
spoken
low
to
the
young
advocate
could
be
heard
by
all
for
the
silence
of
death
reigned
in
that
terrible
guardroom
certain
privileged
persons
are
sometimes
allowed
to
see
famous
criminals
on
their
way
through
this
room
or
through
the
passages
so
that
the
clerk
and
the
gendarmes
who
had
charge
of
the
abbe
carlos
made
no
remark
also
in
consequence
of
the
devoted
zeal
of
the
sergeant
who
had
snatched
up
the
baroness
to
hinder
any
communication
between
the
prisoner
and
the
visitors
there
was
a
considerable
space
between
them
let
us
go
on
said
jacques
collin
making
an
effort
to
rise
at
the
same
moment
the
little
ball
rolled
out
of
his
sleeve
and
the
spot
where
it
fell
was
noted
by
the
baroness
who
could
look
about
her
freely
from
under
her
veil
the
little
pellet
being
damp
and
sticky
did
not
roll
for
such
trivial
details
apparently
unimportant
had
all
been
duly
considered
by
jacques
collin
to
insure
success
when
the
prisoner
had
been
led
up
the
higher
part
of
the
steps
asie
very
unaffectedly
dropped
her
bag
and
picked
it
up
again
but
in
stooping
she
seized
the
pellet
which
had
escaped
notice
its
color
being
exactly
like
that
of
the
dust
and
mud
on
the
floor
oh
dear
cried
she
it
goes
to
my
he
is
dying
or
seems
to
be
replied
the
sergeant
monsieur
said
asie
to
the
lawyer
take
me
at
once
to
monsieur
camusot
i
have
come
about
this
case
and
he
might
be
very
glad
to
see
me
before
examining
that
poor
the
lawyer
and
the
baroness
left
the
guardroom
with
its
greasy
fuliginous
walls
but
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
asie
exclaimed
oh
and
my
dog
my
poor
little
dog
and
she
rushed
off
like
a
mad
creature
down
the
des
asking
every
one
where
her
dog
was
she
got
to
the
corridor
beyond
la
galerie
marchande
or
merchant
s
hall
as
it
is
called
and
flew
to
the
staircase
saying
there
he
is
these
stairs
lead
to
the
cour
de
harlay
through
which
asie
having
played
out
the
farce
passed
out
and
took
a
hackney
cab
on
the
quai
des
orfevres
where
there
is
a
stand
thus
she
vanished
with
the
summons
requiring
europe
to
appear
her
real
name
being
unknown
to
the
police
and
the
lawyers
rue
cried
she
to
the
driver
asie
could
depend
on
the
absolute
secrecy
of
an
purchaser
known
as
madame
nourrisson
who
also
called
herself
madame
de
and
who
would
lend
asie
not
merely
her
personality
but
her
shop
at
need
for
it
was
there
that
nucingen
had
bargained
for
the
surrender
of
esther
asie
was
quite
at
home
there
for
she
had
a
bedroom
in
madame
nourrisson
s
establishment
she
paid
the
driver
and
went
up
to
her
room
nodding
to
madame
nourrisson
in
a
way
to
make
her
understand
that
she
had
not
time
to
say
two
words
to
her
as
soon
as
she
was
safe
from
observation
asie
unwrapped
the
papers
with
the
care
of
a
savant
unrolling
a
palimpsest
after
reading
the
instructions
she
thought
it
wise
to
copy
the
lines
intended
for
lucien
on
a
sheet
of
then
she
went
down
to
madame
nourrisson
to
whom
she
talked
while
a
little
went
to
fetch
a
cab
from
the
boulevard
des
italiens
she
thus
extracted
the
addresses
of
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
and
of
madame
de
serizy
which
were
known
to
madame
nourrisson
by
her
dealings
with
their
maids
all
this
running
about
and
elaborate
business
took
up
more
than
two
hours
madame
la
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
who
lived
at
the
top
of
the
faubourg
kept
madame
de
waiting
an
hour
although
the
lady
after
knocking
at
the
boudoir
door
had
handed
in
to
her
mistress
a
card
with
madame
de
s
name
on
which
asie
had
written
called
about
pressing
business
concerning
her
first
glance
at
the
duchess
face
showed
her
how
her
visit
must
be
she
apologized
for
disturbing
madame
la
duchesse
when
she
was
resting
on
the
plea
of
the
danger
in
which
lucien
stood
who
are
you
asked
the
duchess
without
any
pretence
at
politeness
as
she
looked
at
asie
from
head
to
foot
for
asie
though
she
might
be
taken
for
a
baroness
by
maitre
massol
in
the
des
when
she
stood
on
the
carpet
in
the
boudoir
of
the
hotel
de
cadignan
looked
like
a
splash
of
mud
on
a
white
satin
gown
i
am
a
dealer
in
clothes
madame
la
duchesse
for
in
such
matters
every
lady
applies
to
women
whose
business
rests
on
a
basis
of
perfect
secrecy
i
have
never
betrayed
anybody
though
god
knows
how
many
great
ladies
have
intrusted
their
diamonds
to
me
by
the
month
while
wearing
false
jewels
made
to
imitate
them
you
have
some
other
name
said
the
duchess
smiling
at
a
reminiscence
recalled
to
her
by
this
reply
yes
madame
la
duchesse
i
am
madame
de
on
great
occasions
but
in
the
trade
i
am
madame
well
well
said
the
duchess
in
an
altered
tone
i
am
able
to
be
of
great
service
asie
went
on
for
we
hear
the
husbands
secrets
as
well
as
the
wives
i
have
done
many
little
jobs
for
monsieur
de
marsay
whom
madame
la
duchesse
that
will
do
that
will
do
cried
the
duchess
what
about
lucien
if
you
wish
to
save
him
madame
you
must
have
courage
enough
to
lose
no
time
in
dressing
but
indeed
madame
la
duchesse
you
could
not
look
more
charming
than
you
do
at
this
moment
you
are
sweet
enough
to
charm
anybody
take
an
old
woman
s
word
for
it
in
short
madame
do
not
wait
for
your
carriage
but
get
into
my
hackney
coach
come
to
madame
de
serizy
s
if
you
hope
to
avert
worse
misfortunes
than
the
death
of
that
cherub
go
on
i
will
follow
you
said
the
duchess
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
between
us
we
may
give
leontine
some
courage
notwithstanding
the
really
demoniacal
activity
of
this
dorine
of
the
hulks
the
clock
was
striking
two
when
she
and
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
went
into
the
comtesse
de
serizy
s
house
in
the
rue
de
la
antin
once
there
thanks
to
the
duchess
not
an
instant
was
lost
the
two
women
were
at
once
shown
up
to
the
countess
whom
they
found
reclining
on
a
couch
in
a
miniature
chalet
surrounded
by
a
garden
fragrant
with
the
rarest
flowers
that
is
well
said
asie
looking
about
her
no
one
can
overhear
oh
my
dear
i
am
half
dead
tell
me
diane
what
have
you
done
cried
the
duchess
starting
up
like
a
fawn
and
seizing
the
duchess
by
the
shoulders
she
melted
into
tears
come
come
leontine
there
are
occasions
when
women
like
us
must
not
cry
but
act
said
the
duchess
forcing
the
countess
to
sit
down
on
the
sofa
by
her
side
asie
studied
the
countess
face
with
the
scrutiny
peculiar
to
those
old
hands
which
pierces
to
the
soul
of
a
woman
as
certainly
as
a
surgeon
s
instrument
probes
a
wound
the
sorrow
that
engraves
ineradicable
lines
on
the
heart
and
on
the
features
she
was
dressed
without
the
least
touch
of
vanity
she
was
now
and
her
printed
muslin
wrapper
tumbled
and
untidy
showed
her
bosom
without
any
art
or
even
stays
her
eyes
were
set
in
dark
circles
and
her
mottled
cheeks
showed
the
traces
of
bitter
tears
she
wore
no
sash
round
her
waist
the
embroidery
on
her
petticoat
and
shift
was
all
crumpled
her
hair
knotted
up
under
a
lace
cap
had
not
been
combed
for
hours
and
showed
as
a
thin
short
plait
and
ragged
little
curls
leontine
had
forgotten
to
put
on
her
false
hair
you
are
in
love
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
said
asie
sententiously
leontine
then
saw
the
woman
and
started
with
horror
who
is
that
my
dear
diane
she
asked
of
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
whom
should
i
bring
with
me
but
a
woman
who
is
devoted
to
lucien
and
willing
to
help
us
asie
had
hit
the
truth
madame
de
serizy
who
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
fickle
of
fashionable
women
had
had
an
attachment
of
ten
years
standing
for
the
marquis
d
aiglemont
since
the
marquis
departure
for
the
colonies
she
had
gone
wild
about
lucien
and
had
won
him
from
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
knowing
nothing
like
the
paris
world
generally
of
lucien
s
passion
for
esther
in
the
world
of
fashion
a
recognized
attachment
does
more
to
ruin
a
woman
s
reputation
than
ten
unconfessed
liaisons
how
much
more
then
two
such
attachments
however
as
no
one
thought
of
madame
de
serizy
as
a
responsible
person
the
historian
can
not
undertake
to
speak
for
her
virtue
thus
doubly
dog
she
was
fair
of
medium
height
and
well
preserved
as
a
fair
woman
can
be
who
is
well
preserved
at
all
that
is
to
say
she
did
not
look
more
than
thirty
being
slender
but
not
lean
with
a
white
skin
and
flaxen
hair
she
had
hands
feet
and
a
shape
of
aristocratic
elegance
and
was
as
witty
as
all
the
ronquerolles
spiteful
therefore
to
women
and
to
men
her
large
fortune
her
husband
s
fine
position
and
that
of
her
brother
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
had
protected
her
from
the
mortifications
with
which
any
other
woman
would
have
been
overwhelmed
she
had
this
great
merit
that
she
was
honest
in
her
depravity
and
confessed
her
worship
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
regency
now
at
this
woman
who
had
hitherto
regarded
men
as
no
more
than
pleasing
playthings
to
whom
indeed
she
had
strange
to
say
granted
much
regarding
love
as
merely
a
matter
of
sacrifice
to
gain
the
upper
hand
this
woman
on
first
seeing
lucien
had
been
seized
with
such
a
passion
as
the
baron
de
nucingen
s
for
esther
she
had
loved
as
asie
had
just
told
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
this
postponement
of
youth
is
more
common
with
parisian
women
than
might
be
supposed
and
causes
the
ruin
of
some
virtuous
souls
just
as
they
are
reaching
the
haven
of
forty
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
was
the
only
person
in
the
secret
of
the
vehement
and
absorbing
passion
of
which
the
joys
from
the
girlish
suspicion
of
first
love
to
the
preposterous
follies
of
fulfilment
had
made
leontine
half
crazy
and
insatiable
true
love
as
we
know
is
merciless
the
discovery
of
esther
s
existence
had
been
followed
by
one
of
those
outbursts
of
rage
which
in
a
woman
rise
even
to
the
pitch
of
murder
then
came
the
phase
of
meanness
to
which
a
sincere
affection
humbles
itself
so
gladly
indeed
for
the
last
month
the
countess
would
have
given
ten
years
of
her
life
to
have
lucien
again
for
one
week
at
last
she
had
even
resigned
herself
to
accept
esther
as
her
rival
just
when
the
news
of
her
lover
s
arrest
had
come
like
the
last
trump
on
this
paroxysm
of
devotion
the
countess
had
nearly
died
of
it
her
husband
had
himself
nursed
her
in
bed
fearing
the
betrayal
of
delirium
and
for
hours
she
had
been
living
with
a
knife
in
her
heart
she
said
to
her
husband
in
her
fever
save
lucien
and
i
will
live
henceforth
for
you
indeed
as
madame
la
duchesse
tells
you
it
is
of
no
use
to
make
your
eyes
like
boiled
gooseberries
cried
the
dreadful
asie
shaking
the
countess
by
the
arm
if
you
want
to
save
him
there
is
not
a
minute
to
lose
he
is
innocent
i
swear
it
by
my
mother
s
bones
yes
yes
of
course
he
is
cried
the
countess
looking
quite
kindly
at
the
dreadful
old
woman
but
asie
went
on
if
monsieur
camusot
questions
him
the
wrong
way
he
can
make
a
guilty
man
of
him
with
two
sentences
so
if
it
is
in
your
power
to
get
the
conciergerie
opened
to
you
and
to
say
a
few
words
to
him
go
at
once
and
give
him
this
he
will
be
released
i
will
answer
for
it
now
get
him
out
of
the
scrape
for
you
got
him
into
i
yes
you
you
fine
ladies
never
have
a
son
even
when
you
own
millions
when
i
allowed
myself
the
luxury
of
keeping
boys
they
always
had
their
pockets
full
of
gold
their
amusements
amused
me
it
is
delightful
to
be
mother
and
mistress
in
one
now
you
you
let
the
men
you
love
die
of
hunger
without
asking
any
questions
esther
now
made
no
speeches
she
gave
at
the
cost
of
perdition
soul
and
body
the
million
your
lucien
was
required
to
show
and
that
is
what
has
brought
him
to
this
pass
poor
girl
did
she
do
that
i
love
her
said
leontine
yes
now
said
asie
with
freezing
irony
she
was
a
real
beauty
but
now
my
angel
you
are
better
looking
than
she
and
lucien
s
marriage
is
so
effectually
broken
off
that
nothing
can
mend
it
said
the
duchess
in
a
whisper
to
leontine
the
effect
of
this
revelation
and
forecast
was
so
great
on
the
countess
that
she
was
well
again
she
passed
her
hand
over
her
brow
she
was
young
once
more
now
my
lady
hot
foot
and
make
haste
said
asie
seeing
the
change
and
guessing
what
had
caused
it
but
said
madame
de
maufrigneuse
if
the
first
thing
is
to
prevent
lucien
s
being
examined
by
monsieur
camusot
we
can
do
that
by
writing
two
words
to
the
judge
and
sending
your
man
with
it
to
the
palais
then
come
into
my
room
said
madame
de
serizy
this
is
what
was
taking
place
at
the
palais
while
lucien
s
protectresses
were
obeying
the
orders
issued
by
jacques
collin
the
gendarmes
placed
the
moribund
prisoner
on
a
chair
facing
the
window
in
monsieur
camusot
s
room
he
was
sitting
in
his
place
in
front
of
his
table
coquart
pen
in
hand
had
a
little
table
to
himself
a
few
yards
off
the
aspect
of
a
magistrate
s
chambers
is
not
a
matter
of
indifference
and
if
this
room
had
not
been
chosen
intentionally
it
must
be
owned
that
chance
had
favored
justice
an
examining
judge
like
a
painter
requires
the
clear
equable
light
of
a
north
window
for
the
criminal
s
face
is
a
picture
which
he
must
constantly
study
hence
most
magistrates
place
their
table
as
this
of
camusot
s
was
arranged
so
as
to
sit
with
their
back
to
the
window
and
leave
the
face
of
the
examinee
in
broad
daylight
not
one
of
them
all
but
by
the
end
of
six
months
has
assumed
an
and
indifferent
expression
if
he
does
not
wear
spectacles
and
maintains
it
throughout
the
examination
it
was
a
sudden
change
of
expression
in
the
prisoner
s
face
detected
by
these
means
and
caused
by
a
sudden
question
that
led
to
the
discovery
of
the
crime
committed
by
castaing
at
the
very
moment
when
after
a
long
consultation
with
the
public
prosecutor
the
magistrate
was
about
to
let
the
criminal
loose
on
society
for
lack
of
evidence
this
detail
will
show
the
least
intelligent
person
how
living
interesting
curious
and
dramatically
terrible
is
the
conflict
of
an
examination
a
conflict
without
witnesses
but
always
recorded
god
knows
what
remains
on
the
paper
of
the
scenes
at
white
heat
in
which
a
look
a
tone
a
quiver
of
the
features
the
faintest
touch
of
color
lent
by
some
emotion
has
been
fraught
with
danger
as
though
the
adversaries
were
savages
watching
each
other
to
plant
a
fatal
stroke
a
report
is
no
more
than
the
ashes
of
the
fire
what
is
your
real
name
camusot
asked
jacques
collin
don
carlos
herrera
canon
of
the
royal
chapter
of
toledo
and
secret
envoy
of
his
majesty
ferdinand
it
must
here
be
observed
that
jacques
collin
spoke
french
like
a
spanish
trollop
blundering
over
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
his
answers
almost
unintelligible
and
to
require
them
to
be
repeated
but
monsieur
de
nucingen
s
german
barbarisms
have
already
weighted
this
scene
too
much
to
allow
of
the
introduction
of
other
sentences
no
less
difficult
to
read
and
hindering
the
rapid
progress
of
the
tale
then
you
have
papers
to
prove
your
right
to
the
dignities
of
which
you
speak
asked
camusot
yes
monsieur
my
passport
a
letter
from
his
catholic
majesty
authorizing
my
in
short
if
you
will
but
send
at
once
to
the
spanish
embassy
two
lines
which
i
will
write
in
your
presence
i
shall
be
identified
then
if
you
wish
for
further
evidence
i
will
write
to
his
eminence
the
high
almoner
of
france
and
he
will
immediately
send
his
private
and
do
you
still
pretend
that
you
are
dying
asked
the
magistrate
if
you
have
really
gone
through
all
the
sufferings
you
have
complained
of
since
your
arrest
you
ought
to
be
dead
by
this
time
said
camusot
ironically
you
are
simply
trying
the
courage
of
an
innocent
man
and
the
strength
of
his
constitution
said
the
prisoner
mildly
coquart
ring
send
for
the
prison
doctor
and
an
infirmary
we
shall
be
obliged
to
remove
your
coat
and
proceed
to
verify
the
marks
on
your
shoulder
camusot
went
on
i
am
in
your
hands
the
prisoner
then
inquired
whether
the
magistrate
would
be
kind
enough
to
explain
to
him
what
he
meant
by
the
marks
and
why
they
should
be
sought
on
his
shoulder
the
judge
was
prepared
for
this
question
you
are
suspected
of
being
jacques
collin
an
escaped
convict
whose
daring
shrinks
at
nothing
not
even
at
sacrilege
said
camusot
promptly
his
eyes
fixed
on
those
of
the
prisoner
jacques
collin
gave
no
sign
and
did
not
color
he
remained
quite
calm
and
assumed
an
air
of
guileless
curiosity
as
he
gazed
at
camusot
i
monsieur
a
convict
may
the
order
i
belong
to
and
god
above
forgive
you
for
such
an
error
tell
me
what
i
can
do
to
prevent
your
continuing
to
offer
such
an
insult
to
the
rights
of
free
men
to
the
church
and
to
the
king
my
the
judge
made
no
reply
to
this
but
explained
to
the
abbe
that
if
he
had
been
branded
a
penalty
at
that
time
inflicted
by
law
on
all
convicts
sent
to
the
hulks
the
letters
could
be
made
to
show
by
giving
him
a
slap
on
the
shoulder
oh
monsieur
said
jacques
collin
it
would
indeed
be
unfortunate
if
my
devotion
to
the
royal
cause
should
prove
fatal
to
explain
yourself
said
the
judge
that
is
what
you
are
here
well
monsieur
i
must
have
a
great
many
scars
on
my
back
for
i
was
shot
in
the
back
as
a
traitor
to
my
country
while
i
was
faithful
to
my
king
by
constitutionalists
who
left
me
for
you
were
shot
and
you
are
alive
said
camusot
i
had
made
friends
with
some
of
the
soldiers
to
whom
certain
pious
persons
had
sent
money
so
they
placed
me
so
far
off
that
only
spent
balls
reached
me
and
the
men
aimed
at
my
back
this
is
a
fact
that
his
excellency
the
ambassador
can
bear
witness
to
this
devil
of
a
man
has
an
answer
for
everything
however
so
much
the
better
thought
camusot
who
assumed
so
much
severity
only
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
justice
and
of
the
police
how
is
it
that
a
man
of
your
character
he
went
on
addressing
the
convict
should
have
been
found
in
the
house
of
the
baron
de
nucingen
s
mistress
and
such
a
mistress
a
girl
who
had
been
a
common
prostitute
this
is
why
i
was
found
in
a
courtesan
s
house
monsieur
replied
jacques
collin
but
before
telling
you
the
reasons
for
my
being
there
i
ought
to
mention
that
at
the
moment
when
i
was
just
going
upstairs
i
was
seized
with
the
first
attack
of
my
illness
and
i
had
no
time
to
speak
to
the
girl
i
knew
of
mademoiselle
esther
s
intention
of
killing
herself
and
as
young
lucien
de
rubempre
s
interests
were
involved
and
i
have
a
particular
affection
for
him
for
sacredly
secret
reasons
i
was
going
to
try
to
persuade
the
poor
creature
to
give
up
the
idea
suggested
to
her
by
despair
i
meant
to
tell
her
that
lucien
must
certainly
fail
in
his
last
attempt
to
win
mademoiselle
clotilde
de
grandlieu
and
i
hoped
that
by
telling
her
she
had
inherited
seven
millions
of
francs
i
might
give
her
courage
to
live
i
am
convinced
monsieur
le
juge
that
i
am
a
martyr
to
the
secrets
confided
to
me
by
the
suddenness
of
my
illness
i
believe
that
i
had
been
poisoned
that
very
morning
but
my
strong
constitution
has
saved
me
i
know
that
a
certain
agent
of
the
political
police
is
dogging
me
and
trying
to
entangle
me
in
some
discreditable
business
if
at
my
request
you
had
sent
for
a
doctor
on
my
arrival
here
you
would
have
had
ample
proof
of
what
i
am
telling
you
as
to
the
state
of
my
health
believe
me
monsieur
some
persons
far
above
our
heads
have
some
strong
interest
in
getting
me
mistaken
for
some
villain
so
as
to
have
a
right
to
get
rid
of
me
it
is
not
all
profit
to
serve
a
king
they
have
their
meannesses
the
church
alone
is
it
is
impossible
to
do
justice
to
the
play
of
jacques
collin
s
countenance
as
he
carefully
spun
out
his
speech
sentence
by
sentence
for
ten
minutes
and
it
was
all
so
plausible
especially
the
mention
of
corentin
that
the
lawyer
was
shaken
will
you
confide
to
me
the
reasons
of
your
affection
for
monsieur
lucien
de
rubempre
can
you
not
guess
them
i
am
sixty
years
of
age
monsieur
i
implore
you
do
not
write
it
is
because
must
i
say
it
it
will
be
to
your
own
advantage
and
more
particularly
to
monsieur
lucien
de
rubempre
s
if
you
tell
everything
replied
the
judge
because
he
is
oh
god
he
is
my
son
he
gasped
out
with
an
effort
and
he
fainted
away
do
not
write
that
down
coquart
said
camusot
in
an
undertone
coquart
rose
to
fetch
a
little
phial
of
four
thieves
if
he
is
jacques
collin
he
is
a
splendid
actor
thought
camusot
coquart
held
the
phial
under
the
convict
s
nose
while
the
judge
examined
him
with
the
keen
eye
of
a
lynx
and
a
magistrate
take
his
wig
off
said
camusot
after
waiting
till
the
man
recovered
consciousness
jacques
collin
heard
and
quaked
with
terror
for
he
knew
how
vile
an
expression
his
face
would
assume
if
you
have
not
strength
enough
to
take
your
wig
off
yourself
yes
coquart
remove
it
said
camusot
to
his
clerk
jacques
collin
bent
his
head
to
the
clerk
with
admirable
resignation
but
then
his
head
bereft
of
that
adornment
was
hideous
to
behold
in
its
natural
aspect
the
sight
of
it
left
camusot
in
the
greatest
uncertainty
while
waiting
for
the
doctor
and
the
man
from
the
infirmary
he
set
to
work
to
classify
and
examine
the
various
papers
and
the
objects
seized
in
lucien
s
rooms
after
carrying
out
their
functions
in
the
rue
at
mademoiselle
esther
s
house
the
police
had
searched
the
rooms
at
the
quai
malaquais
you
have
your
hand
on
some
letters
from
the
comtesse
de
serizy
said
carlos
herrera
but
i
can
not
imagine
why
you
should
have
almost
all
lucien
s
papers
he
added
with
a
smile
of
overwhelming
irony
at
the
judge
camusot
as
he
saw
the
smile
understood
the
bearing
of
the
word
lucien
de
rubempre
is
in
custody
under
suspicion
of
being
your
accomplice
said
he
watching
to
see
the
effect
of
this
news
on
his
examinee
you
have
brought
about
a
great
misfortune
for
he
is
as
innocent
as
i
am
replied
the
sham
spaniard
without
betraying
the
smallest
agitation
we
shall
see
we
have
not
as
yet
established
your
identity
camusot
observed
surprised
at
the
prisoner
s
indifference
if
you
are
really
don
carlos
herrera
the
position
of
lucien
chardon
will
at
once
be
completely
to
be
sure
she
became
madame
chardon
mademoiselle
de
rubempre
murmured
carlos
ah
that
was
one
of
the
greatest
sins
of
my
he
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
by
the
movement
of
his
lips
seemed
to
be
uttering
a
fervent
prayer
but
if
you
are
jacques
collin
and
if
he
was
and
knew
that
he
was
the
companion
of
an
escaped
convict
a
sacrilegious
wretch
all
the
crimes
of
which
he
is
suspected
by
the
law
are
more
than
probably
carlos
herrera
sat
like
bronze
as
he
heard
this
speech
very
cleverly
delivered
by
the
judge
and
his
only
reply
to
the
words
that
he
and
was
to
lift
his
hands
to
heaven
with
a
gesture
of
noble
and
dignified
sorrow
monsieur
l
abbe
camusot
went
on
with
the
greatest
politeness
if
you
are
don
carlos
herrera
you
will
forgive
us
for
what
we
are
obliged
to
do
in
the
interests
of
justice
and
jacques
collin
detected
a
snare
in
the
lawyer
s
very
voice
as
he
spoke
the
words
monsieur
l
the
man
s
face
never
changed
camusot
had
looked
for
a
gleam
of
joy
which
might
have
been
the
first
indication
of
his
being
a
convict
betraying
the
exquisite
satisfaction
of
a
criminal
deceiving
his
judge
but
this
hero
of
the
hulks
was
strong
in
machiavellian
dissimulation
i
am
accustomed
to
diplomacy
and
i
belong
to
an
order
of
very
austere
discipline
replied
jacques
collin
with
apostolic
mildness
i
understand
everything
and
am
inured
to
suffering
i
should
be
free
by
this
time
if
you
had
discovered
in
my
room
the
where
i
keep
my
papers
for
i
see
you
have
none
but
unimportant
this
was
a
finishing
stroke
to
camusot
jacques
collin
by
his
air
of
ease
and
simplicity
had
counteracted
all
the
suspicions
to
which
his
appearance
unwigged
had
given
rise
where
are
these
papers
i
will
tell
you
exactly
if
you
will
get
a
secretary
from
the
spanish
embassy
to
accompany
your
messenger
he
will
take
them
and
be
answerable
to
you
for
the
documents
for
it
is
to
me
a
matter
of
confidential
duty
diplomatic
secrets
which
would
compromise
his
late
majesty
louis
xviii
indeed
monsieur
it
would
be
better
however
you
are
a
magistrate
and
after
all
the
ambassador
to
whom
i
refer
the
whole
question
must
at
this
juncture
the
usher
announced
the
arrival
of
the
doctor
and
the
infirmary
attendant
who
came
in
monsieur
lebrun
said
camusot
to
the
doctor
i
have
sent
for
you
to
examine
the
state
of
health
of
this
prisoner
under
suspicion
he
says
he
had
been
poisoned
and
at
the
point
of
death
since
the
day
before
yesterday
see
if
there
is
any
risk
in
undressing
him
to
look
for
the
doctor
lebrun
took
jacques
collin
s
hand
felt
his
pulse
asked
to
look
at
his
tongue
and
scrutinized
him
steadily
this
inspection
lasted
about
ten
minutes
the
prisoner
has
been
suffering
severely
said
the
medical
officer
but
at
this
moment
he
is
amazingly
strong
that
spurious
energy
monsieur
is
due
to
nervous
excitement
caused
by
my
strange
position
said
jacques
collin
with
the
dignity
of
a
bishop
that
is
possible
said
monsieur
lebrun
at
a
sign
from
camusot
the
prisoner
was
stripped
of
everything
but
his
trousers
even
of
his
shirt
and
the
spectators
might
admire
the
hairy
torso
of
a
cyclops
it
was
that
of
the
farnese
hercules
at
naples
in
its
colossal
exaggeration
for
what
does
nature
intend
a
man
of
this
build
said
lebrun
to
the
judge
the
usher
brought
in
the
ebony
staff
which
from
time
immemorial
has
been
the
insignia
of
his
office
and
is
called
his
rod
he
struck
it
several
times
over
the
place
where
the
executioner
had
branded
the
fatal
letters
seventeen
spots
appeared
irregularly
distributed
but
the
most
careful
scrutiny
could
not
recognize
the
shape
of
any
letters
the
usher
indeed
pointed
out
that
the
top
bar
of
the
letter
t
was
shown
by
two
spots
with
an
interval
between
of
the
length
of
that
bar
between
the
two
points
at
each
end
of
it
and
there
was
another
spot
where
the
bottom
of
the
t
should
be
still
that
is
quite
uncertain
said
camusot
seeing
doubt
in
the
expression
of
the
prison
doctor
s
countenance
carlos
begged
them
to
make
the
same
experiment
on
the
other
shoulder
and
the
middle
of
his
back
about
fifteen
more
such
scars
appeared
which
at
the
spaniard
s
request
the
doctor
made
a
note
of
and
he
pronounced
that
the
man
s
back
had
been
so
extensively
seamed
by
wounds
that
the
brand
would
not
show
even
if
it
had
been
made
by
the
executioner
an
now
came
in
from
the
prefecture
and
handed
a
note
to
monsieur
camusot
requesting
an
answer
after
reading
it
the
lawyer
went
to
speak
to
coquart
but
in
such
a
low
voice
that
no
one
could
catch
a
word
only
by
a
glance
from
camusot
jacques
collin
could
guess
that
some
information
concerning
him
had
been
sent
by
the
prefet
of
police
that
friend
of
peyrade
s
is
still
at
my
heels
thought
jacques
collin
if
only
i
knew
him
i
would
get
rid
of
him
as
i
did
of
contenson
if
only
i
could
see
asie
once
more
after
signing
a
paper
written
by
coquart
the
judge
put
it
into
an
envelope
and
handed
it
to
the
clerk
of
the
delegate
s
office
this
is
an
indispensable
auxiliary
to
justice
it
is
under
the
direction
of
a
police
commissioner
and
consists
of
who
with
the
assistance
of
the
police
commissioners
of
each
district
carry
into
effect
orders
for
searching
the
houses
or
apprehending
the
persons
of
those
who
are
suspected
of
complicity
in
crimes
and
felonies
these
functionaries
in
authority
save
the
examining
magistrates
a
great
deal
of
very
precious
time
at
a
sign
from
the
judge
the
prisoner
was
dressed
by
monsieur
lebrun
and
the
attendant
who
then
withdrew
with
the
usher
camusot
sat
down
at
his
table
and
played
with
his
pen
you
have
an
aunt
he
suddenly
said
to
jacques
collin
an
aunt
echoed
don
carlos
herrera
with
amazement
why
monsieur
i
have
no
relations
i
am
the
unacknowledged
son
of
the
late
duke
of
but
to
himself
he
said
they
are
burning
an
allusion
to
the
game
of
hot
cockles
which
is
indeed
a
childlike
symbol
of
the
dreadful
struggle
between
justice
and
the
criminal
pooh
said
camusot
you
still
have
an
aunt
living
mademoiselle
jacqueline
collin
whom
you
placed
in
esther
s
service
under
the
eccentric
name
of
jacques
collin
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
indifference
that
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
cool
curiosity
he
gave
throughout
to
the
judge
s
words
while
camusot
studied
him
with
cunning
attention
take
care
said
camusot
listen
to
i
am
listening
you
aunt
is
a
wardrobe
dealer
at
the
temple
her
business
is
managed
by
a
demoiselle
paccard
the
sister
of
a
convict
herself
a
very
good
girl
known
as
la
romette
justice
is
on
the
traces
of
your
aunt
and
in
a
few
hours
we
shall
have
decisive
evidence
the
woman
is
wholly
devoted
to
you
pray
go
on
monsieur
le
juge
said
collin
coolly
in
answer
to
a
pause
i
am
listening
to
your
aunt
who
is
about
five
years
older
than
you
are
was
formerly
marat
s
mistress
of
odious
memory
from
that
source
she
derived
the
little
fortune
she
possesses
from
information
i
have
received
she
must
be
a
very
clever
receiver
of
stolen
goods
for
no
proofs
have
yet
been
found
to
commit
her
on
after
marat
s
death
she
seems
from
the
notes
i
have
here
to
have
lived
with
a
chemist
who
was
condemned
to
death
in
the
year
xii
for
issuing
false
coin
she
was
called
as
witness
in
the
case
it
was
from
this
intimacy
that
she
derived
her
knowledge
of
poisons
in
and
in
she
spent
two
years
in
prison
for
placing
girls
under
age
upon
the
streets
you
were
already
convicted
of
forgery
you
had
left
the
banking
house
where
your
aunt
had
been
able
to
place
you
as
clerk
thanks
to
the
education
you
had
had
and
the
favor
enjoyed
by
your
aunt
with
certain
persons
for
whose
debaucheries
she
supplied
victims
all
this
prisoner
is
not
much
like
the
dignity
of
the
dukes
d
ossuna
do
you
persist
in
your
denial
jacques
collin
sat
listening
to
monsieur
camusot
and
thinking
of
his
happy
childhood
at
the
college
of
the
oratorians
where
he
had
been
brought
up
a
meditation
which
lent
him
a
truly
amazed
look
and
in
spite
of
his
skill
as
a
practised
examiner
camusot
could
bring
no
sort
of
expression
to
those
placid
features
if
you
have
accurately
recorded
the
account
of
myself
i
gave
you
at
first
said
jacques
collin
you
can
read
it
through
again
i
can
not
alter
the
facts
i
never
went
to
the
woman
s
house
how
should
i
know
who
her
cook
was
the
persons
of
whom
you
speak
are
utterly
unknown
to
notwithstanding
your
denial
we
shall
proceed
to
confront
you
with
persons
who
may
succeed
in
diminishing
your
assurance
a
man
who
has
been
three
times
shot
is
used
to
anything
replied
jacques
collin
meekly
camusot
proceeded
to
examine
the
seized
papers
while
awaiting
the
return
of
the
famous
whose
expedition
was
amazing
for
at
eleven
the
inquiry
having
begun
at
ten
o
clock
the
usher
came
in
to
inform
the
judge
in
an
undertone
of
s
arrival
show
him
in
replied
camusot
who
had
been
expected
to
exclaim
it
is
he
as
he
came
in
stood
puzzled
he
did
not
recognize
his
man
in
a
face
pitted
with
smallpox
this
hesitancy
startled
the
magistrate
it
is
his
build
his
height
said
the
agent
oh
yes
it
is
you
jacques
collin
he
went
on
as
he
examined
his
eyes
forehead
and
ears
there
are
some
things
which
no
disguise
can
alter
certainly
it
is
he
monsieur
camusot
jacques
has
the
scar
of
a
cut
on
his
left
arm
take
off
his
coat
and
you
will
see
jacques
collin
was
again
obliged
to
take
off
his
coat
turned
up
his
sleeve
and
showed
the
scar
he
had
spoken
of
it
is
the
scar
of
a
bullet
replied
don
carlos
herrera
here
are
several
ah
it
is
certainly
his
voice
cried
your
certainty
said
camusot
is
merely
an
opinion
it
is
not
i
know
that
said
with
deference
but
i
will
bring
witnesses
one
of
the
boarders
from
the
maison
vauquer
is
here
already
said
he
with
an
eye
on
collin
but
the
prisoner
s
set
calm
face
did
not
move
a
muscle
show
the
person
in
said
camusot
roughly
his
dissatisfaction
betraying
itself
in
spite
of
his
seeming
indifference
this
irritation
was
not
lost
on
jacques
collin
who
had
not
counted
on
the
judge
s
sympathy
and
sat
lost
in
apathy
produced
by
his
deep
meditations
in
the
effort
to
guess
what
the
cause
could
be
the
usher
now
showed
in
madame
poiret
at
this
unexpected
appearance
the
prisoner
had
a
slight
shiver
but
his
trepidation
was
not
remarked
by
camusot
who
seemed
to
have
made
up
his
mind
what
is
your
name
asked
he
proceeding
to
carry
out
the
formalities
introductory
to
all
depositions
and
examinations
madame
poiret
a
little
old
woman
as
white
and
wrinkled
as
a
sweetbread
dressed
in
a
silk
gown
gave
her
name
as
christine
michelle
michonneau
wife
of
one
poiret
and
her
age
as
years
said
that
she
was
born
in
paris
lived
in
the
rue
des
poules
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
postes
and
that
her
business
was
that
of
keeper
in
and
said
the
judge
you
lived
madame
in
a
kept
by
a
madame
vauquer
yes
monsieur
it
was
there
that
i
met
monsieur
poiret
a
retired
official
who
became
my
husband
and
whom
i
have
nursed
in
his
bed
this
twelvemonth
past
poor
man
he
is
very
bad
and
i
can
not
be
long
away
from
there
was
a
certain
vautrin
in
the
house
at
the
time
asked
camusot
oh
monsieur
that
is
quite
a
long
story
he
was
a
horrible
man
from
the
galleys
you
helped
to
get
him
arrested
that
is
not
true
you
are
in
the
presence
of
the
law
be
careful
said
monsieur
camusot
severely
madame
poiret
was
silent
try
to
remember
camusot
went
on
do
you
recollect
the
man
would
you
know
him
again
i
think
is
this
the
man
madame
poiret
put
on
her
and
looked
at
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
it
is
his
build
his
height
and
yet
no
if
monsieur
le
juge
she
said
if
i
could
see
his
chest
i
should
recognize
him
at
the
magistrate
and
his
clerk
could
not
help
laughing
notwithstanding
the
gravity
of
their
office
jacques
collin
joined
in
their
hilarity
but
discreetly
the
prisoner
had
not
put
on
his
coat
after
had
removed
it
and
at
a
sign
from
the
judge
he
obligingly
opened
his
shirt
yes
that
is
his
fur
trimming
sure
enough
but
it
has
worn
gray
monsieur
vautrin
cried
madame
poiret
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
asked
the
judge
of
the
prisoner
that
she
is
mad
replied
jacques
collin
bless
me
if
i
had
a
doubt
for
his
face
is
altered
that
voice
would
be
enough
he
is
the
man
who
threatened
me
ah
and
those
are
his
eyes
the
police
agent
and
this
woman
said
camusot
speaking
to
jacques
collin
can
not
possibly
have
conspired
to
say
the
same
thing
for
neither
of
them
had
seen
you
till
now
how
do
you
account
for
that
justice
has
blundered
more
conspicuously
even
than
it
does
now
in
accepting
the
evidence
of
a
woman
who
recognizes
a
man
by
the
hair
on
his
chest
and
the
suspicions
of
a
police
agent
replied
jacques
collin
i
am
said
to
resemble
a
great
criminal
in
voice
eyes
and
build
that
seems
a
little
vague
as
to
the
memory
which
would
prove
certain
relations
between
madame
and
my
sosie
which
she
does
not
blush
to
own
you
yourself
laughed
at
allow
me
monsieur
in
the
interests
of
truth
which
i
am
far
more
anxious
to
establish
for
my
own
sake
than
you
can
be
for
the
sake
of
justice
to
ask
this
lady
madame
foiret
poret
excuse
me
i
am
a
spaniard
whether
she
remembers
the
other
persons
who
lived
in
this
what
did
you
call
the
house
a
said
madame
poiret
i
do
not
know
what
that
a
house
where
you
can
dine
and
breakfast
by
you
are
right
said
camusot
with
a
favorable
nod
to
jacques
collin
whose
apparent
good
faith
in
suggesting
means
to
arrive
at
some
conclusion
struck
him
greatly
try
to
remember
the
boarders
who
were
in
the
house
when
jacques
collin
was
there
were
monsieur
de
rastignac
doctor
bianchon
pere
goriot
mademoiselle
taillefer
that
will
do
said
camusot
steadily
watching
jacques
collin
whose
expression
did
not
change
well
about
this
pere
goriot
he
is
dead
said
madame
poiret
monsieur
said
jacques
collin
i
have
several
times
met
monsieur
de
rastignac
a
friend
i
believe
of
madame
de
nucingen
s
and
if
it
is
the
same
he
certainly
never
supposed
me
to
be
the
convict
with
whom
these
persons
try
to
identify
monsieur
de
rastignac
and
doctor
bianchon
said
the
magistrate
both
hold
such
a
social
position
that
their
evidence
if
it
is
in
your
favor
will
be
enough
to
procure
your
coquart
fill
up
a
summons
for
each
of
the
formalities
attending
madame
poiret
s
examination
were
over
in
a
few
minutes
coquart
read
aloud
to
her
the
notes
he
had
made
of
the
little
scene
and
she
signed
the
paper
but
the
prisoner
refused
to
sign
alleging
his
ignorance
of
the
forms
of
french
law
that
is
enough
for
said
monsieur
camusot
you
must
be
wanting
food
i
will
have
you
taken
back
to
the
alas
i
am
suffering
too
much
to
be
able
to
eat
said
jacques
collin
camusot
was
anxious
to
time
jacques
collin
s
return
to
coincide
with
the
prisoners
hour
of
exercise
in
the
prison
yard
but
he
needed
a
reply
from
the
governor
of
the
conciergerie
to
the
order
he
had
given
him
in
the
morning
and
he
rang
for
the
usher
the
usher
appeared
and
told
him
that
the
porter
s
wife
from
the
house
on
the
quai
malaquais
had
an
important
document
to
communicate
with
reference
to
monsieur
lucien
de
rubempre
this
was
so
serious
a
matter
that
it
put
camusot
s
intentions
out
of
his
head
show
her
in
said
he
beg
your
pardon
pray
excuse
me
gentlemen
all
said
the
woman
courtesying
to
the
judge
and
the
abbe
carlos
by
turns
we
were
so
worried
by
the
law
my
husband
and
me
the
twice
when
it
has
marched
into
our
house
that
we
had
forgotten
a
letter
that
was
lying
for
monsieur
lucien
in
our
chest
of
drawers
which
we
paid
ten
sous
for
it
though
it
was
posted
in
paris
for
it
is
very
heavy
sir
would
you
please
to
pay
me
back
the
postage
for
god
knows
when
we
shall
see
our
lodgers
again
was
this
letter
handed
to
you
by
the
postman
asked
camusot
after
carefully
examining
the
envelope
yes
coquart
write
full
notes
of
this
go
on
my
good
woman
tell
us
your
name
and
your
camusot
made
the
woman
take
the
oath
and
then
he
dictated
the
document
while
these
formalities
were
being
carried
out
he
was
scrutinizing
the
postmark
which
showed
the
hours
of
posting
and
delivery
as
well
at
the
date
of
the
day
and
this
letter
left
for
lucien
the
day
after
esther
s
death
had
beyond
a
doubt
been
written
and
posted
on
the
day
of
the
catastrophe
monsieur
camusot
s
amazement
may
therefore
be
imagined
when
he
read
this
letter
written
and
signed
by
her
whom
the
law
believed
to
have
been
the
victim
of
a
crime
to
monday
may
my
last
day
ten
in
the
morning
my
lucien
i
have
not
an
hour
to
live
at
eleven
o
clock
i
shall
be
dead
and
i
shall
die
without
a
pang
i
have
paid
fifty
thousand
francs
for
a
neat
little
black
currant
containing
a
poison
that
will
kill
me
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
and
so
my
darling
you
may
tell
yourself
my
little
esther
had
no
and
yet
i
shall
suffer
in
writing
these
pages
the
monster
who
has
paid
so
dear
for
me
knowing
that
the
day
when
i
should
know
myself
to
be
his
would
have
no
morrow
nucingen
has
just
left
me
as
drunk
as
a
bear
with
his
skin
full
of
wind
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
my
life
i
have
had
the
opportunity
of
comparing
my
old
trade
as
a
street
hussy
with
the
life
of
true
love
of
placing
the
tenderness
which
unfolds
in
the
infinite
above
the
horrors
of
a
duty
which
longs
to
destroy
itself
and
leave
no
room
even
for
a
kiss
only
such
loathing
could
make
death
delightful
i
have
taken
a
bath
i
should
have
liked
to
send
for
the
father
confessor
of
the
convent
where
i
was
baptized
to
have
confessed
and
washed
my
soul
but
i
have
had
enough
of
prostitution
it
would
be
profaning
a
sacrament
and
besides
i
feel
myself
cleansed
in
the
waters
of
sincere
repentance
god
must
do
what
he
will
with
me
but
enough
of
all
this
maudlin
for
you
i
want
to
be
your
esther
to
the
last
moment
not
to
bore
you
with
my
death
or
the
future
or
god
who
is
good
and
who
would
not
be
good
if
he
were
to
torture
me
in
the
next
world
when
i
have
endured
so
much
misery
in
this
i
have
before
me
your
beautiful
portrait
painted
by
madame
de
mirbel
that
sheet
of
ivory
used
to
comfort
me
in
your
absence
i
look
at
it
with
rapture
as
i
write
you
my
last
thoughts
and
tell
you
of
the
last
throbbing
of
my
heart
i
shall
enclose
the
miniature
in
this
letter
for
i
can
not
bear
that
it
should
be
stolen
or
sold
the
mere
thought
that
what
has
been
my
great
joy
may
lie
behind
a
shop
window
mixed
up
with
the
ladies
and
officers
of
the
empire
or
a
parcel
of
chinese
absurdities
is
a
small
death
to
me
destroy
that
picture
my
sweetheart
wipe
it
out
never
give
it
to
any
one
unless
indeed
the
gift
might
win
back
the
heart
of
that
walking
maypole
that
clotilde
de
grandlieu
who
will
make
you
black
and
blue
in
her
sleep
her
bones
are
so
yes
to
that
i
consent
and
then
i
shall
still
be
of
some
use
to
you
as
when
i
was
alive
oh
to
give
you
pleasure
or
only
to
make
you
laugh
i
would
have
stood
over
a
brazier
with
an
apple
in
my
mouth
to
cook
it
for
so
my
death
even
will
be
of
service
to
i
should
have
marred
your
home
oh
that
clotilde
i
can
not
understand
she
might
have
been
your
wife
have
borne
your
name
have
never
left
you
day
or
night
have
belonged
to
you
and
she
could
make
difficulties
only
the
faubourg
can
do
that
and
yet
she
has
not
ten
pounds
of
flesh
on
her
bones
poor
lucien
dear
ambitious
failure
i
am
thinking
of
your
future
life
well
well
you
will
more
than
once
regret
your
poor
faithful
dog
the
good
girl
who
would
fly
to
serve
you
who
would
have
been
dragged
into
a
police
court
to
secure
your
happiness
whose
only
occupation
was
to
think
of
your
pleasures
and
invent
new
ones
who
was
so
full
of
love
for
you
in
her
hair
her
feet
her
ears
your
ballerina
in
short
whose
every
look
was
a
benediction
who
for
six
years
has
thought
of
nothing
but
you
who
was
so
entirely
your
chattel
that
i
have
never
been
anything
but
an
effluence
of
your
soul
as
light
is
that
of
the
sun
however
for
lack
of
money
and
of
honor
i
can
never
be
your
wife
i
have
at
any
rate
provided
for
your
future
by
giving
you
all
i
have
come
as
soon
as
you
get
this
letter
and
take
what
you
find
under
my
pillow
for
i
do
not
trust
the
people
about
me
understand
that
i
mean
to
look
beautiful
when
i
am
dead
i
shall
go
to
bed
and
lay
myself
flat
in
an
attitude
why
not
then
i
shall
break
the
little
pill
against
the
roof
of
my
mouth
and
shall
not
be
disfigured
by
any
convulsion
or
by
a
ridiculous
position
madame
de
serizy
has
quarreled
with
you
i
know
because
of
me
but
when
she
hears
that
i
am
dead
you
see
dear
pet
she
will
forgive
make
it
up
with
her
and
she
will
find
you
a
suitable
wife
if
the
grandlieus
persist
in
their
refusal
my
dear
i
do
not
want
you
to
grieve
too
much
when
you
hear
of
my
death
to
begin
with
i
must
tell
you
that
the
hour
of
eleven
on
monday
morning
the
thirteenth
of
may
is
only
the
end
of
a
long
illness
which
began
on
the
day
when
on
the
terrace
of
you
threw
me
back
on
my
former
line
of
life
the
soul
may
be
sick
as
the
body
is
but
the
soul
can
not
submit
stupidly
to
suffering
like
the
body
the
body
does
not
uphold
the
soul
as
the
soul
upholds
the
body
and
the
soul
sees
a
means
of
cure
in
the
reflection
which
leads
to
the
needlewoman
s
resource
the
bushel
of
charcoal
you
gave
me
a
whole
life
the
day
before
yesterday
when
you
said
that
if
clotilde
still
refused
you
you
would
marry
me
it
would
have
been
a
great
misfortune
for
us
both
i
should
have
been
still
more
dead
so
to
speak
for
there
are
more
and
less
bitter
deaths
the
world
would
never
have
recognized
us
for
two
months
past
i
have
been
thinking
of
many
things
i
can
tell
you
a
poor
girl
is
in
the
mire
as
i
was
before
i
went
into
the
convent
men
think
her
handsome
they
make
her
serve
their
pleasure
without
thinking
any
consideration
necessary
they
pack
her
off
on
foot
after
fetching
her
in
a
carriage
if
they
do
not
spit
in
her
face
it
is
only
because
her
beauty
preserves
her
from
such
indignity
but
morally
speaking
they
do
worse
well
and
if
this
despised
creature
were
to
inherit
five
or
six
millions
of
francs
she
would
be
courted
by
princes
bowed
to
with
respect
as
she
went
past
in
her
carriage
and
might
choose
among
the
oldest
names
in
france
and
navarre
that
world
which
would
have
cried
raca
to
us
on
seeing
two
handsome
creatures
united
and
happy
always
did
honor
to
madame
de
stael
in
spite
of
her
romances
in
real
life
because
she
had
two
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
the
world
which
grovels
before
money
or
glory
will
not
bow
down
before
happiness
or
virtue
for
i
could
have
done
good
oh
how
many
tears
i
would
have
dried
as
many
as
i
have
shed
i
believe
yes
i
would
have
lived
only
for
you
and
for
charity
these
are
the
thoughts
that
make
death
beautiful
so
do
not
lament
my
dear
say
often
to
yourself
there
were
two
good
creatures
two
beautiful
creatures
who
both
died
for
me
ungrudgingly
and
who
adored
keep
a
memory
in
your
heart
of
coralie
and
esther
and
go
your
way
and
prosper
do
you
recollect
the
day
when
you
pointed
out
to
me
a
shriveled
old
woman
in
a
bonnet
and
a
puce
wrapper
all
over
black
the
mistress
of
a
poet
before
the
revolution
hardly
thawed
by
the
sun
though
she
was
sitting
against
the
wall
of
the
tuileries
and
fussing
over
a
pug
the
vilest
of
pugs
she
had
had
footmen
and
carriages
you
know
and
a
fine
house
and
i
said
to
you
then
how
much
better
to
be
dead
at
thirty
well
you
thought
i
was
melancholy
and
you
played
all
sorts
of
pranks
to
amuse
me
and
between
two
kisses
i
said
every
day
some
pretty
woman
leaves
the
play
before
it
is
over
and
i
do
not
want
to
see
the
last
piece
that
is
all
you
must
think
me
a
great
chatterbox
but
this
is
my
last
effusion
i
write
as
if
i
were
talking
to
you
and
i
like
to
talk
cheerfully
i
have
always
had
a
horror
of
a
dressmaker
pitying
herself
you
know
i
knew
how
to
die
decently
once
before
on
my
return
from
that
fatal
where
the
men
said
i
had
been
a
prostitute
no
no
my
dear
love
never
give
this
portrait
to
any
one
if
you
could
know
with
what
a
gush
of
love
i
have
sat
losing
myself
in
your
eyes
looking
at
them
with
rapture
during
a
pause
i
allowed
myself
you
would
feel
as
you
gathered
up
the
affection
with
which
i
have
tried
to
overlay
the
ivory
that
the
soul
of
your
little
pet
is
indeed
there
a
dead
woman
craving
alms
that
is
a
funny
come
i
must
learn
to
lie
quiet
in
my
grave
you
have
no
idea
how
heroic
my
death
would
seem
to
some
fools
if
they
could
know
nucingen
last
night
offered
me
two
millions
of
francs
if
i
would
love
him
as
i
love
you
he
will
be
handsomely
robbed
when
he
hears
that
i
have
kept
my
word
and
died
of
him
i
tried
all
i
could
still
to
breathe
the
air
you
breathe
i
said
to
the
fat
scoundrel
do
you
want
me
to
love
you
as
you
wish
to
promise
even
that
i
will
never
see
lucien
again
what
must
i
do
he
give
me
the
two
millions
for
you
should
have
seen
his
face
i
could
have
laughed
if
it
had
not
been
so
tragical
for
me
spare
yourself
the
trouble
of
refusing
said
i
i
see
you
care
more
for
your
two
millions
than
for
me
a
woman
is
always
glad
to
know
at
what
she
is
valued
and
i
turned
my
back
on
him
in
a
few
hours
the
old
rascal
will
know
that
i
was
not
in
jest
who
will
part
your
hair
as
nicely
as
i
do
pooh
i
will
think
no
more
of
anything
in
life
i
have
but
five
minutes
i
give
them
to
god
do
not
be
jealous
of
him
dear
heart
i
shall
speak
to
him
of
you
beseeching
him
for
your
happiness
as
the
price
of
my
death
and
my
punishment
in
the
next
world
i
am
vexed
enough
at
having
to
go
to
hell
i
should
have
liked
to
see
the
angels
to
know
if
they
are
like
you
my
darling
i
give
you
all
the
blessing
of
my
woes
even
in
the
grave
i
am
your
esther
it
is
striking
eleven
i
have
said
my
last
prayers
i
am
going
to
bed
to
die
once
more
farewell
i
wish
that
the
warmth
of
my
hand
could
leave
my
soul
there
where
i
press
a
last
kiss
and
once
more
i
must
call
you
my
dearest
love
though
you
are
the
cause
of
the
death
of
your
a
vague
feeling
of
jealousy
tightened
on
the
magistrate
s
heart
as
he
read
this
letter
the
only
letter
from
a
suicide
he
had
ever
found
written
with
such
lightness
though
it
was
a
feverish
lightness
and
the
last
effort
of
a
blind
affection
what
is
there
in
the
man
that
he
should
be
loved
so
well
thought
he
saying
what
every
man
says
who
has
not
the
gift
of
attracting
women
if
you
can
prove
not
merely
that
you
are
not
jacques
collin
and
an
escaped
convict
but
that
you
are
in
fact
don
carlos
herrera
canon
of
toledo
and
secret
envoy
of
this
majesty
ferdinand
said
he
addressing
the
prisoner
you
will
be
released
for
the
impartiality
demanded
by
my
office
requires
me
to
tell
you
that
i
have
this
moment
received
a
letter
written
by
mademoiselle
esther
gobseck
in
which
she
declares
her
intention
of
killing
herself
and
expresses
suspicions
as
to
her
servants
which
would
seem
to
point
to
them
as
the
thieves
who
have
made
off
with
the
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
as
he
spoke
monsieur
camusot
was
comparing
the
writing
of
the
letter
with
that
of
the
will
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
same
person
had
written
both
monsieur
you
were
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
believe
in
a
murder
do
not
be
too
hasty
in
believing
in
a
heh
said
camusot
scrutinizing
the
prisoner
with
a
piercing
eye
do
not
suppose
that
i
am
compromising
myself
by
telling
you
that
the
sum
may
possibly
be
recovered
said
jacques
collin
making
the
judge
understand
that
he
saw
his
suspicions
that
poor
girl
was
much
loved
by
those
about
her
and
if
i
were
free
i
would
undertake
to
search
for
this
money
which
no
doubt
belongs
to
the
being
i
love
best
in
the
world
to
lucien
will
you
allow
me
to
read
that
letter
it
will
not
take
long
it
is
evidence
of
my
dear
boy
s
innocence
you
can
not
fear
that
i
shall
destroy
it
nor
that
i
shall
talk
about
it
i
am
in
solitary
in
confinement
you
will
be
so
no
longer
cried
the
magistrate
it
is
i
who
must
beg
you
to
get
well
as
soon
as
possible
refer
to
your
ambassador
if
you
choose
and
he
handed
the
letter
to
jacques
collin
camusot
was
glad
to
be
out
of
a
difficulty
to
be
able
to
satisfy
the
public
prosecutor
mesdames
de
maufrigneuse
and
de
serizy
nevertheless
he
studied
his
prisoner
s
face
with
cold
curiosity
while
collin
read
esther
s
letter
in
spite
of
the
apparent
genuineness
of
the
feelings
it
expressed
he
said
to
himself
but
it
is
a
face
worthy
of
the
hulks
all
the
same
that
is
the
way
to
love
said
jacques
collin
returning
the
letter
and
he
showed
camusot
a
face
bathed
in
tears
if
only
you
knew
him
he
went
on
so
youthful
so
innocent
a
soul
so
splendidly
handsome
a
child
a
poet
the
impulse
to
sacrifice
oneself
to
him
is
irresistible
to
satisfy
his
lightest
wish
that
dear
boy
is
so
fascinating
when
he
chooses
and
so
said
the
magistrate
making
a
final
effort
to
discover
the
truth
you
can
not
possibly
be
jacques
collin
no
monsieur
replied
the
convict
and
jacques
collin
was
more
entirely
don
carlos
herrera
than
ever
in
his
anxiety
to
complete
his
work
he
went
up
to
the
judge
led
him
to
the
window
and
gave
himself
the
airs
of
a
prince
of
the
church
assuming
a
confidential
tone
i
am
so
fond
of
that
boy
monsieur
that
if
it
were
needful
to
spare
that
idol
of
my
heart
a
mere
discomfort
even
that
i
should
be
the
criminal
you
take
me
for
i
would
surrender
said
he
in
an
undertone
i
would
follow
the
example
of
the
poor
girl
who
has
killed
herself
for
his
benefit
and
i
beg
you
monsieur
to
grant
me
a
favor
namely
to
set
lucien
at
liberty
my
duty
forbids
it
said
camusot
very
but
if
a
sinner
may
make
a
compromise
with
heaven
justice
too
has
its
softer
side
and
if
you
can
give
me
sufficient
reasons
speak
your
words
will
not
be
taken
well
then
jacques
collin
went
on
taken
in
by
camusot
s
apparent
goodwill
i
know
what
that
poor
boy
is
suffering
at
this
moment
he
is
capable
of
trying
to
kill
himself
when
he
finds
himself
a
prisoner
oh
as
to
that
said
camusot
with
a
shrug
you
do
not
know
whom
you
will
oblige
by
obliging
me
added
jacques
collin
trying
to
harp
on
another
string
you
will
be
doing
a
service
to
others
more
powerful
than
any
comtesse
de
serizy
or
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
who
will
never
forgive
you
for
having
had
their
letters
in
your
chambers
and
he
pointed
to
two
packets
of
perfumed
papers
my
order
has
a
good
monsieur
said
camusot
that
is
enough
you
must
find
better
reasons
to
give
me
i
am
as
much
interested
in
the
prisoner
as
in
public
believe
me
then
i
know
lucien
he
has
a
soul
of
a
woman
of
a
poet
and
a
southerner
without
persistency
or
will
said
jacques
collin
who
fancied
that
he
saw
that
he
had
won
the
judge
over
you
are
convinced
of
the
young
man
s
innocence
do
not
torture
him
do
not
question
him
give
him
that
letter
tell
him
that
he
is
esther
s
heir
and
restore
him
to
freedom
if
you
act
otherwise
you
will
bring
despair
on
yourself
whereas
if
you
simply
release
him
i
will
explain
to
you
keep
me
still
in
solitary
confinement
or
this
evening
everything
that
may
strike
you
as
mysterious
in
the
case
and
the
reasons
for
the
persecution
of
which
i
am
the
object
but
it
will
be
at
the
risk
of
my
life
a
price
has
been
set
on
my
head
these
six
years
past
lucien
free
rich
and
married
to
clotilde
de
grandlieu
and
my
task
on
earth
will
be
done
i
shall
no
longer
try
to
save
my
my
persecutor
was
a
spy
under
your
late
what
corentin
ah
is
his
name
corentin
thank
you
monsieur
well
will
you
promise
to
do
as
i
ask
you
a
magistrate
can
make
no
coquart
tell
the
usher
and
the
gendarmes
to
take
the
prisoner
back
to
the
i
will
give
orders
that
you
are
to
have
a
private
room
he
added
pleasantly
with
a
slight
nod
to
the
convict
struck
by
jacques
collin
s
request
and
remembering
how
he
had
insisted
that
he
wished
to
be
examined
first
as
a
privilege
to
his
state
of
health
camusot
s
suspicions
were
aroused
once
more
allowing
his
vague
doubts
to
make
themselves
heard
he
noticed
that
the
dying
man
was
walking
off
with
the
strength
of
a
hercules
having
abandoned
all
the
tricks
he
had
aped
so
well
on
appearing
before
the
magistrate
monsieur
jacques
collin
turned
round
notwithstanding
your
refusal
to
sign
the
document
my
clerk
will
read
you
the
minutes
of
your
the
prisoner
was
evidently
in
excellent
health
the
readiness
with
which
he
came
back
and
sat
down
by
the
clerk
was
a
fresh
light
to
the
magistrate
s
mind
you
have
got
well
very
suddenly
said
camusot
caught
thought
jacques
collin
and
he
replied
joy
monsieur
is
the
only
that
letter
the
proof
of
innocence
of
which
i
had
no
doubt
these
are
the
grand
the
judge
kept
a
meditative
eye
on
the
prisoner
when
the
usher
and
the
gendarmes
again
took
him
in
charge
then
with
a
start
like
a
waking
man
he
tossed
esther
s
letter
across
to
the
table
where
his
clerk
sat
saying
coquart
copy
that
if
it
is
natural
to
man
to
be
suspicious
as
to
some
favor
required
of
him
when
it
is
antagonistic
to
his
interests
or
his
duty
and
sometimes
even
when
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
this
feeling
is
law
to
an
examining
magistrate
the
more
this
prisoner
whose
identity
was
not
yet
ascertained
pointed
to
clouds
on
the
horizon
in
the
event
of
lucien
s
being
examined
the
more
necessary
did
the
interrogatory
seem
to
camusot
even
if
this
formality
had
not
been
required
by
the
code
and
by
common
practice
it
was
indispensable
as
bearing
on
the
identification
of
the
abbe
carlos
there
is
in
every
walk
of
life
the
business
conscience
in
default
of
curiosity
camusot
would
have
examined
lucien
as
he
had
examined
jacques
collin
with
all
the
cunning
which
the
most
honest
magistrate
allows
himself
to
use
in
such
cases
the
services
he
might
render
and
his
own
promotion
were
secondary
in
camusot
s
mind
to
his
anxiety
to
know
or
guess
the
truth
even
if
he
should
never
tell
it
he
stood
drumming
on
the
while
following
the
current
of
his
conjectures
for
in
these
moods
thought
is
like
a
stream
flowing
through
many
countries
magistrates
in
love
with
truth
are
like
jealous
women
they
give
way
to
a
thousand
hypotheses
and
probe
them
with
the
of
suspicion
as
the
sacrificing
priest
of
old
eviscerated
his
victims
thus
they
arrive
not
perhaps
at
truth
but
at
probability
and
at
last
see
the
truth
beyond
a
woman
the
man
she
loves
as
the
judge
a
criminal
in
such
a
frame
of
mind
a
glance
a
word
a
tone
of
voice
the
slightest
hesitation
is
enough
to
certify
the
hidden
fact
treason
or
crime
the
style
in
which
he
depicted
his
devotion
to
his
son
if
he
is
his
son
is
enough
to
make
me
think
that
he
was
in
the
girl
s
house
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
plunder
and
never
suspecting
that
the
dead
woman
s
pillow
covered
a
will
he
no
doubt
annexed
for
his
son
the
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
as
a
precaution
that
is
why
he
can
promise
to
recover
the
money
m
de
rubempre
owes
it
to
himself
and
to
justice
to
account
for
his
father
s
position
in
the
world
and
he
offers
me
the
protection
of
his
order
his
order
if
i
do
not
examine
lucien
as
has
been
seen
a
magistrate
conducts
an
examination
exactly
as
he
thinks
proper
he
is
at
liberty
to
display
his
acumen
or
be
absolutely
blunt
an
examination
may
be
everything
or
nothing
therein
lies
the
favor
camusot
rang
the
usher
had
returned
he
was
sent
to
fetch
monsieur
lucien
de
rubempre
with
an
injunction
to
prohibit
his
speaking
to
anybody
on
his
way
up
it
was
by
this
time
two
in
the
afternoon
there
is
some
secret
said
the
judge
to
himself
and
that
secret
must
be
very
important
my
amphibious
friend
since
he
is
neither
priest
nor
secular
nor
convict
nor
spaniard
though
he
wants
to
hinder
his
protege
from
letting
out
something
dreadful
argues
thus
the
poet
is
weak
and
effeminate
he
is
not
like
me
a
hercules
in
diplomacy
and
you
will
easily
wring
our
secret
from
well
we
will
get
everything
out
of
this
and
he
sat
tapping
the
edge
of
his
table
with
the
ivory
while
coquart
copied
esther
s
letter
how
whimsical
is
the
action
of
our
faculties
camusot
conceived
of
every
crime
as
possible
and
overlooked
the
only
one
that
the
prisoner
had
now
committed
the
forgery
of
the
will
for
lucien
s
advantage
let
those
whose
envy
vents
itself
on
magistrates
think
for
a
moment
of
their
life
spent
in
perpetual
suspicion
of
the
torments
these
men
must
inflict
on
their
minds
for
civil
cases
are
not
less
tortuous
than
criminal
examinations
and
it
will
occur
to
them
perhaps
that
the
priest
and
the
lawyer
wear
an
equally
heavy
coat
of
mail
equally
furnished
with
spikes
in
the
lining
however
every
profession
has
its
hair
shirt
and
its
chinese
puzzles
it
was
about
two
o
clock
when
monsieur
camusot
saw
lucien
de
rubempre
come
in
pale
worn
his
eyes
red
and
swollen
in
short
in
a
state
of
dejection
which
enabled
the
magistrate
to
compare
nature
with
art
the
really
dying
man
with
the
stage
performance
his
walk
from
the
conciergerie
to
the
judge
s
chambers
between
two
gendarmes
and
preceded
by
the
usher
had
put
the
crowning
touch
to
lucien
s
despair
it
is
the
poet
s
nature
to
prefer
execution
to
condemnation
as
he
saw
this
being
so
completely
bereft
of
the
moral
courage
which
is
the
essence
of
a
judge
and
which
the
last
prisoner
had
so
strongly
manifested
monsieur
camusot
disdained
the
easy
victory
and
this
scorn
enabled
him
to
strike
a
decisive
blow
since
it
left
him
on
the
ground
that
horrible
clearness
of
mind
which
the
marksman
feels
when
he
is
firing
at
a
puppet
collect
yourself
monsieur
de
rubempre
you
are
in
the
presence
of
a
magistrate
who
is
eager
to
repair
the
mischief
done
involuntarily
by
the
law
when
a
man
is
taken
into
custody
on
suspicion
that
has
no
foundation
i
believe
you
to
be
innocent
and
you
will
soon
be
at
here
is
the
evidence
of
your
innocence
it
is
a
letter
kept
for
you
during
your
absence
by
your
porter
s
wife
she
has
just
brought
it
here
in
the
commotion
caused
by
the
visitation
of
justice
and
the
news
of
your
arrest
at
fontainebleau
the
woman
forgot
the
letter
which
was
written
by
mademoiselle
esther
read
it
lucien
took
the
letter
read
it
and
melted
into
tears
he
sobbed
and
could
not
say
a
single
word
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
during
which
lucien
with
great
difficulty
recovered
his
the
clerk
laid
before
him
the
copy
of
the
letter
and
begged
him
to
sign
a
footnote
certifying
that
the
copy
was
faithful
to
the
original
and
might
be
used
in
its
stead
on
all
occasions
in
the
course
of
this
preliminary
inquiry
giving
him
the
option
of
comparing
the
two
but
lucien
of
course
took
coquart
s
word
for
its
accuracy
monsieur
said
the
lawyer
with
friendly
good
nature
it
is
nevertheless
impossible
that
i
should
release
you
without
carrying
out
the
legal
formalities
and
asking
you
some
it
is
almost
as
a
witness
that
i
require
you
to
answer
to
such
a
man
as
you
i
think
it
is
almost
unnecessary
to
point
out
that
the
oath
to
tell
the
whole
truth
is
not
in
this
case
a
mere
appeal
to
your
conscience
but
a
necessity
for
your
own
sake
your
position
having
been
for
a
time
somewhat
ambiguous
the
truth
can
do
you
no
harm
be
it
what
it
may
falsehood
will
send
you
to
trial
and
compel
me
to
send
you
back
to
the
conciergerie
whereas
if
you
answer
fully
to
my
questions
you
will
sleep
in
your
own
house
and
be
rehabilitated
by
this
paragraph
in
the
papers
monsieur
de
rubempre
who
was
arrested
yesterday
at
fontainebleau
was
set
at
liberty
after
a
very
brief
this
speech
made
a
deep
impression
on
lucien
and
the
judge
seeing
the
temper
of
his
prisoner
added
i
may
repeat
to
you
that
you
were
suspected
of
being
accessory
to
the
murder
by
poison
of
this
demoiselle
esther
her
suicide
is
clearly
proved
and
there
is
an
end
of
that
but
a
sum
of
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
has
been
stolen
which
she
had
disposed
of
by
will
and
you
are
the
legatee
this
is
a
felony
the
crime
was
perpetrated
before
the
discovery
of
the
will
now
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
a
person
who
loves
you
as
much
as
you
loved
mademoiselle
esther
committed
the
theft
for
your
do
not
interrupt
me
camusot
went
on
seeing
that
lucien
was
about
to
speak
and
commanding
silence
by
a
gesture
i
am
asking
you
nothing
so
far
i
am
anxious
to
make
you
understand
how
deeply
your
honor
is
concerned
in
this
question
give
up
the
false
and
contemptible
notion
of
the
honor
binding
two
accomplices
and
tell
the
whole
the
reader
must
already
have
observed
the
extreme
disproportion
of
the
weapons
in
this
conflict
between
the
prisoner
under
suspicion
and
the
examining
judge
absolute
denial
when
skilfully
used
has
in
its
favor
its
positive
simplicity
and
sufficiently
defends
the
criminal
but
it
is
in
a
way
a
coat
of
mail
which
becomes
crushing
as
soon
as
the
stiletto
of
finds
a
joint
to
it
as
soon
as
mere
denial
is
ineffectual
in
face
of
certain
proven
facts
the
examinee
is
entirely
at
the
judge
s
mercy
now
supposing
that
a
sort
of
like
lucien
might
if
he
were
saved
from
the
first
shipwreck
of
his
honesty
amend
his
ways
and
become
a
useful
member
of
society
he
will
be
lost
in
the
pitfalls
of
his
examination
the
judge
has
the
driest
possible
record
drawn
up
of
the
proceedings
a
faithful
analysis
of
the
questions
and
answers
but
no
trace
remains
of
his
insidiously
paternal
addresses
or
his
captious
remonstrances
such
as
this
speech
the
judges
of
the
superior
courts
see
the
results
but
see
nothing
of
the
means
hence
as
some
experienced
persons
have
thought
it
would
be
a
good
plan
that
as
in
england
a
jury
should
hear
the
examination
for
a
short
while
france
enjoyed
the
benefit
of
this
system
under
the
code
of
brumaire
of
the
year
this
body
was
known
as
the
examining
jury
as
distinguished
from
the
trying
jury
as
to
the
final
trial
if
we
should
restore
the
examining
jury
it
would
have
to
be
the
function
of
the
superior
courts
without
the
aid
of
a
jury
and
now
said
camusot
after
a
pause
what
is
your
name
attention
monsieur
coquart
said
he
to
the
clerk
lucien
chardon
de
and
you
were
born
at
and
lucien
named
the
day
month
and
year
you
inherited
no
fortune
none
and
yet
during
your
first
residence
in
paris
you
spent
a
great
deal
as
compared
with
your
small
income
yes
monsieur
but
at
that
time
i
had
a
most
devoted
friend
in
mademoiselle
coralie
and
i
was
so
unhappy
as
to
lose
her
it
was
my
grief
at
her
death
that
made
me
return
to
my
country
that
is
right
monsieur
said
camusot
i
commend
your
frankness
it
will
be
thoroughly
lucien
it
will
be
seen
was
prepared
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
on
your
return
to
paris
you
lived
even
more
expensively
than
before
camusot
went
on
you
lived
like
a
man
who
might
have
about
sixty
thousand
francs
a
yes
who
supplied
you
with
the
money
my
protector
the
abbe
carlos
where
did
you
meet
him
we
met
when
traveling
just
as
i
was
about
to
be
quit
of
life
by
committing
you
never
heard
him
spoken
of
by
your
family
by
your
mother
can
you
remember
the
year
and
the
month
when
you
first
became
connected
with
mademoiselle
esther
towards
the
end
of
at
a
small
theatre
on
the
at
first
she
was
an
expense
to
you
yes
lately
in
the
hope
of
marrying
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
you
purchased
the
ruins
of
the
chateau
de
rubempre
you
added
land
to
the
value
of
a
million
francs
and
you
told
the
family
of
grandlieu
that
your
sister
and
your
had
just
come
into
a
considerable
fortune
and
that
their
liberality
had
supplied
you
with
the
did
you
tell
the
grandlieus
this
monsieur
yes
you
do
not
know
the
reason
why
the
marriage
was
broken
off
not
in
the
least
well
the
grandlieus
sent
one
of
the
most
respectable
attorneys
in
paris
to
see
your
and
inquire
into
the
facts
at
angouleme
this
lawyer
from
the
statements
of
your
sister
and
learned
that
they
not
only
had
hardly
lent
you
any
money
but
also
that
their
inheritance
consisted
of
land
of
some
extent
no
doubt
but
that
the
whole
amount
of
invested
capital
was
not
more
than
about
two
hundred
thousand
now
you
can
not
wonder
that
such
people
as
the
grandlieus
should
reject
a
fortune
of
which
the
source
is
more
than
doubtful
this
monsieur
is
what
a
lie
has
led
to
lucien
was
petrified
by
this
revelation
and
the
little
presence
of
mind
he
had
preserved
deserted
him
remember
said
camusot
that
the
police
and
the
law
know
all
they
want
to
and
now
he
went
on
recollecting
jacques
collin
s
assumed
paternity
do
you
know
who
this
pretended
carlos
herrera
is
yes
monsieur
but
i
knew
it
too
too
late
how
explain
he
is
not
a
priest
not
a
spaniard
he
is
an
escaped
convict
said
the
judge
eagerly
yes
replied
lucien
when
he
told
me
the
fatal
secret
i
was
already
under
obligations
to
him
i
had
fancied
i
was
befriended
by
a
respectable
jacques
collin
said
monsieur
camusot
beginning
a
sentence
yes
said
lucien
his
name
is
jacques
very
good
jacques
collin
has
just
now
been
identified
by
another
person
and
though
he
denies
it
he
does
so
i
believe
in
your
interest
but
i
asked
whether
you
knew
who
the
man
is
in
order
to
prove
another
of
jacques
collin
s
lucien
felt
as
though
he
had
hot
iron
in
his
inside
as
he
heard
this
alarming
statement
do
you
not
know
camusot
went
on
that
in
order
to
give
color
to
the
extraordinary
affection
he
has
for
you
he
declares
that
he
is
your
father
he
my
father
oh
monsieur
did
he
tell
you
that
have
you
any
suspicion
of
where
the
money
came
from
that
he
used
to
give
you
for
if
i
am
to
believe
the
evidence
of
the
letter
you
have
in
your
hand
that
poor
girl
mademoiselle
esther
must
have
done
you
lately
the
same
services
as
coralie
formerly
rendered
you
still
for
some
years
as
you
have
just
admitted
you
lived
very
handsomely
without
receiving
anything
from
it
is
i
who
should
ask
you
monsieur
whence
convicts
get
their
money
jacques
collin
my
father
oh
my
poor
mother
and
lucien
burst
into
tears
coquart
read
out
to
the
prisoner
that
part
of
carlos
herrera
s
examination
in
which
he
said
that
lucien
de
rubempre
was
his
the
poet
listened
in
silence
and
with
a
look
that
was
terrible
to
behold
i
am
done
for
he
cried
a
man
is
not
done
for
who
is
faithful
to
the
path
of
honor
and
truth
said
the
judge
but
you
will
commit
jacques
collin
for
trial
said
lucien
undoubtedly
said
camusot
who
aimed
at
making
lucien
talk
speak
but
in
spite
of
all
his
persuasion
and
remonstrances
lucien
would
say
no
more
reflection
had
come
too
late
as
it
does
to
all
men
who
are
the
slaves
of
impulse
there
lies
the
difference
between
the
poet
and
the
man
of
action
one
gives
way
to
feeling
to
reproduce
it
in
living
images
his
judgement
comes
in
after
the
other
feels
and
judges
both
at
once
lucien
remained
pale
and
gloomy
he
saw
himself
at
the
bottom
of
the
precipice
down
which
the
examining
judge
had
rolled
him
by
the
apparent
candor
which
had
entrapped
his
poet
s
soul
he
had
betrayed
not
his
benefactor
but
an
accomplice
who
had
defended
their
position
with
the
courage
of
a
lion
and
a
skill
that
showed
no
flaw
where
jacques
collin
had
saved
everything
by
his
daring
lucien
the
man
of
brains
had
lost
all
by
his
lack
of
intelligence
and
reflection
this
infamous
lie
against
which
he
revolted
had
screened
a
yet
more
infamous
truth
utterly
confounded
by
the
judge
s
skill
overpowered
by
his
cruel
dexterity
by
the
swiftness
of
the
blows
he
had
dealt
him
while
making
use
of
the
errors
of
a
life
laid
bare
as
probes
to
search
his
conscience
lucien
sat
like
an
animal
which
the
butcher
s
had
failed
to
kill
free
and
innocent
when
he
came
before
the
judge
in
a
moment
his
own
avowal
had
made
him
feel
criminal
to
crown
all
as
a
final
grave
irony
camusot
cold
and
calm
pointed
out
to
lucien
that
his
was
the
result
of
a
misapprehension
camusot
was
thinking
of
jacques
collin
s
announcing
himself
as
lucien
s
father
while
lucien
wholly
absorbed
by
his
fear
of
seeing
his
confederacy
with
an
escaped
convict
made
public
had
imitated
the
famous
inadvertency
of
the
murderers
of
ibycus
one
of
s
most
famous
achievements
was
proclaiming
the
constant
triumph
of
natural
feeling
over
engrafted
sentiments
and
defending
the
cause
of
anterior
oaths
by
asserting
that
the
law
of
hospitality
for
instance
ought
to
be
regarded
as
binding
to
the
point
of
negativing
the
obligation
of
a
judicial
oath
he
promulgated
this
theory
in
the
face
of
the
world
from
the
french
tribune
he
boldly
upheld
conspirators
showing
that
it
was
human
to
be
true
to
friendship
rather
than
to
the
tyrannical
laws
brought
out
of
the
social
arsenal
to
be
adjusted
to
circumstances
and
indeed
natural
rights
have
laws
which
have
never
been
codified
but
which
are
more
effectual
and
better
known
than
those
laid
down
by
society
lucien
had
misapprehended
to
his
cost
the
law
of
cohesion
which
required
him
to
be
silent
and
leave
jacques
collin
to
protect
himself
nay
more
he
had
accused
him
in
his
own
interests
the
man
ought
always
to
be
to
him
carlos
herrera
monsieur
camusot
was
rejoicing
in
his
triumph
he
had
secured
two
criminals
he
had
crushed
with
the
hand
of
justice
one
of
the
favorites
of
fashion
and
he
had
found
the
undiscoverable
jacques
collin
he
would
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
cleverest
of
examining
judges
so
he
left
his
prisoner
in
peace
but
he
was
studying
this
speechless
consternation
and
he
saw
drops
of
sweat
collect
on
the
miserable
face
swell
and
fall
mingled
with
two
streams
of
tears
why
should
you
weep
monsieur
de
rubempre
you
are
as
i
have
told
you
mademoiselle
esther
s
legatee
she
having
no
heirs
nor
near
relations
and
her
property
amounts
to
nearly
eight
millions
of
francs
if
the
lost
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
are
this
was
the
last
blow
to
the
poor
wretch
if
you
do
not
lose
your
head
for
ten
minutes
jacques
collin
had
said
in
his
note
and
lucien
by
keeping
cool
would
have
gained
all
his
desire
he
might
have
paid
his
debt
to
jacques
collin
and
have
cut
him
adrift
have
been
rich
and
have
married
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
nothing
could
more
eloquently
demonstrate
the
power
with
which
the
examining
judge
is
armed
as
a
consequence
of
the
isolation
or
separation
of
persons
under
suspicion
or
the
value
of
such
a
communication
as
asie
had
conveyed
to
jacques
collin
ah
monsieur
replied
lucien
with
the
satirical
bitterness
of
a
man
who
makes
a
pedestal
of
his
utter
overthrow
how
appropriate
is
the
phrase
in
legal
slang
to
undergo
for
my
part
if
i
had
to
choose
between
the
physical
torture
of
past
ages
and
the
moral
torture
of
our
day
i
would
not
hesitate
to
prefer
the
sufferings
inflicted
of
old
by
the
what
more
do
you
want
of
me
he
added
haughtily
in
this
place
monsieur
said
the
magistrate
answering
the
poet
s
pride
with
mocking
arrogance
i
alone
have
a
right
to
ask
i
had
the
right
to
refuse
to
answer
them
muttered
the
hapless
lucien
whose
wits
had
come
back
to
him
with
perfect
lucidity
coquart
read
the
minutes
to
the
i
am
the
prisoner
once
more
said
lucien
to
himself
while
the
clerk
was
reading
lucien
came
to
a
determination
which
compelled
him
to
smooth
down
monsieur
camusot
when
coquart
s
drone
ceased
the
poet
started
like
a
man
who
has
slept
through
a
noise
to
which
his
ears
are
accustomed
and
who
is
roused
by
its
cessation
you
have
to
sign
the
report
of
your
examination
said
the
judge
and
am
i
at
liberty
asked
lucien
ironical
in
his
turn
not
yet
said
camusot
but
after
being
confronted
with
jacques
collin
you
will
no
doubt
be
free
justice
must
now
ascertain
whether
or
no
you
are
accessory
to
the
crimes
this
man
may
have
committed
since
his
escape
so
long
ago
as
however
you
are
no
longer
in
the
secret
cells
i
will
write
to
the
governor
to
give
you
a
better
shall
i
find
writing
materials
you
can
have
anything
supplied
to
you
that
you
ask
for
i
will
give
orders
to
that
effect
by
the
usher
who
will
take
you
lucien
mechanically
signed
the
minutes
and
initialed
the
notes
in
obedience
to
coquart
s
indications
with
the
meekness
of
a
resigned
victim
a
single
fact
will
show
what
a
state
he
was
in
better
than
the
minutest
description
the
announcement
that
he
would
be
confronted
with
jacques
collin
had
at
once
dried
the
drops
of
sweat
from
his
brow
and
his
dry
eyes
glittered
with
a
terrible
light
in
short
he
became
in
an
instant
as
brief
as
a
lightning
flash
what
jacques
collin
was
a
man
of
iron
in
men
whose
nature
is
like
lucien
s
a
nature
which
jacques
collin
had
so
thoroughly
fathomed
these
sudden
transitions
from
a
state
of
absolute
demoralization
to
one
that
is
so
to
speak
metallic
so
extreme
is
the
tension
of
every
vital
force
are
the
most
startling
phenomena
of
mental
vitality
the
will
surges
up
like
the
lost
waters
of
a
spring
it
diffuses
itself
throughout
the
machinery
that
lies
ready
for
the
action
of
the
unknown
matter
that
constitutes
it
and
then
the
corpse
is
a
man
again
and
the
man
rushes
on
full
of
energy
for
a
supreme
struggle
lucien
laid
esther
s
letter
next
his
heart
with
the
miniature
she
had
returned
to
him
then
he
haughtily
bowed
to
monsieur
camusot
and
went
off
with
a
firm
step
down
the
corridors
between
two
gendarmes
that
is
a
deep
scoundrel
said
the
judge
to
his
clerk
to
avenge
himself
for
the
crushing
scorn
the
poet
had
displayed
he
thought
he
might
save
himself
by
betraying
his
of
the
two
said
coquart
timidly
the
convict
is
the
most
you
are
free
for
the
rest
of
the
day
coquart
said
the
lawyer
we
have
done
enough
send
away
any
case
that
is
waiting
to
be
called
ah
and
you
must
go
at
once
to
the
public
prosecutor
s
chambers
and
ask
if
he
is
still
there
if
so
ask
him
if
he
can
give
me
a
few
minutes
yes
he
will
not
be
gone
he
added
looking
at
a
common
clock
in
a
wooden
case
painted
green
with
gilt
lines
it
is
but
a
these
examinations
which
are
so
quickly
read
being
written
down
at
full
length
questions
and
answers
alike
take
up
an
enormous
amount
of
time
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
of
the
slowness
of
these
preliminaries
to
a
trial
and
of
these
imprisonments
on
to
the
poor
this
is
ruin
to
the
rich
it
is
disgrace
to
them
only
immediate
release
can
in
any
degree
repair
so
far
as
possible
the
disaster
of
an
arrest
this
is
why
the
two
scenes
here
related
had
taken
up
the
whole
of
the
time
spent
by
asie
in
deciphering
her
master
s
orders
in
getting
a
duchess
out
of
her
boudoir
and
putting
some
energy
into
madame
de
serizy
at
this
moment
camusot
who
was
anxious
to
get
the
full
benefit
of
his
cleverness
took
the
two
documents
read
them
through
and
promised
himself
that
he
would
show
them
to
the
public
prosecutor
and
take
his
opinion
on
them
during
this
meditation
his
usher
came
back
to
tell
him
that
madame
la
comtesse
de
serizy
s
insisted
on
speaking
with
him
at
a
nod
from
camusot
a
servant
out
of
livery
came
in
looked
first
at
the
usher
and
then
at
the
magistrate
and
said
i
have
the
honor
of
speaking
to
monsieur
camusot
yes
replied
the
lawyer
and
his
clerk
camusot
took
a
note
which
the
servant
offered
him
and
read
as
follows
for
the
sake
of
many
interests
which
will
be
obvious
to
you
my
dear
camusot
do
not
examine
monsieur
de
rubempre
we
have
brought
ample
proofs
of
his
innocence
that
he
may
be
released
forthwith
d
de
maufrigneuse
l
de
serizy
burn
this
camusot
understood
at
once
that
he
had
blundered
preposterously
in
laying
snares
for
lucien
and
he
began
by
obeying
the
two
fine
ladies
he
lighted
a
taper
and
burned
the
letter
written
by
the
duchess
the
man
bowed
respectfully
then
madame
de
serizy
is
coming
here
asked
camusot
the
carriage
is
being
brought
at
this
moment
coquart
came
in
to
tell
monsieur
camusot
that
the
public
prosecutor
expected
him
oppressed
by
the
blunder
he
had
committed
in
view
of
his
ambitions
though
to
the
better
ends
of
justice
the
lawyer
in
whom
seven
years
experience
had
perfected
the
sharpness
that
comes
to
a
man
who
in
his
practice
has
had
to
measure
his
wits
against
the
grisettes
of
paris
was
anxious
to
have
some
shield
against
the
resentment
of
two
women
of
fashion
the
taper
in
which
he
had
burned
the
note
was
still
alight
and
he
used
it
to
seal
up
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
s
notes
to
lucien
about
thirty
in
all
and
madame
de
serizy
s
somewhat
voluminous
correspondence
then
he
waited
on
the
public
prosecutor
the
palais
de
justice
is
a
perplexing
maze
of
buildings
piled
one
above
another
some
fine
and
dignified
others
very
mean
the
whole
disfigured
by
its
lack
of
unity
the
des
is
the
largest
known
hall
but
its
nakedness
is
hideous
and
distresses
the
eye
this
vast
cathedral
of
the
law
crushes
the
supreme
court
the
galerie
marchande
ends
in
two
passages
from
this
corridor
there
is
a
double
staircase
a
little
larger
than
that
of
the
criminal
courts
and
under
it
a
large
double
door
the
stairs
lead
down
to
one
of
the
assize
courts
and
the
doors
open
into
another
in
some
years
the
number
of
crimes
committed
in
the
circuit
of
the
seine
is
great
enough
to
necessitate
the
sitting
of
two
benches
close
by
are
the
public
prosecutor
s
offices
the
attorney
s
room
and
library
the
chambers
of
the
and
those
of
the
public
prosecutor
s
deputies
all
these
purlieus
to
use
a
generic
term
communicate
by
narrow
spiral
stairs
and
the
dark
passages
which
are
a
disgrace
to
the
architecture
not
of
paris
only
but
of
all
france
the
interior
arrangement
of
the
sovereign
court
of
justice
outdoes
our
prisons
in
all
that
is
most
hideous
the
writer
describing
our
manners
and
customs
would
shrink
from
the
necessity
of
depicting
the
squalid
corridor
of
about
a
metre
in
width
in
which
the
witnesses
wait
in
the
superior
criminal
court
as
to
the
stove
which
warms
the
court
itself
it
would
disgrace
a
cafe
on
the
boulevard
the
public
prosecutor
s
private
room
forms
part
of
an
octagon
wing
flanking
the
galerie
marchande
built
out
recently
in
regard
to
the
age
of
the
structure
over
the
prison
yard
outside
the
women
s
quarters
all
this
part
of
the
palais
is
overshadowed
by
the
lofty
and
noble
edifice
of
the
and
all
is
solemn
and
silent
monsieur
de
granville
a
worthy
successor
of
the
great
magistrates
of
the
ancient
parlement
would
not
leave
paris
without
coming
to
some
conclusion
in
the
matter
of
lucien
he
expected
to
hear
from
camusot
and
the
judge
s
message
had
plunged
him
into
the
involuntary
suspense
which
waiting
produces
on
even
the
strongest
minds
he
had
been
sitting
in
the
of
his
private
room
he
rose
and
walked
up
and
down
for
having
lingered
in
the
morning
to
intercept
camusot
he
had
found
him
dull
of
apprehension
he
was
vaguely
uneasy
and
worried
and
this
was
why
the
dignity
of
his
high
functions
forbade
his
attempting
to
fetter
the
perfect
independence
of
the
inferior
judge
and
yet
this
trial
nearly
touched
the
honor
and
good
name
of
his
best
friend
and
warmest
supporter
the
comte
de
serizy
minister
of
state
member
of
the
privy
council
of
the
state
council
and
prospective
chancellor
of
the
realm
in
the
event
of
the
death
of
the
noble
old
man
who
held
that
august
office
it
was
monsieur
de
serizy
s
misfortune
to
adore
his
wife
through
fire
and
water
and
he
always
shielded
her
with
his
protection
now
the
public
prosecutor
fully
understood
the
terrible
fuss
that
would
be
made
in
the
world
and
at
court
if
a
crime
should
be
proved
against
a
man
whose
name
had
been
so
often
and
so
malignantly
linked
with
that
of
the
countess
ah
he
sighed
folding
his
arms
formerly
the
supreme
authority
could
take
refuge
in
an
appeal
nowadays
our
mania
for
equality
he
dared
not
say
as
a
poetic
orator
in
the
chamber
courageously
admitted
a
short
while
since
is
the
death
of
this
noble
magistrate
knew
all
the
fascination
and
the
miseries
of
an
illicit
attachment
esther
and
lucien
as
we
have
seen
had
taken
the
rooms
where
the
comte
de
granville
had
lived
secretly
on
connubial
terms
with
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
and
whence
she
had
fled
one
day
lured
away
by
a
villain
see
double
at
the
very
moment
when
the
public
prosecutor
was
saying
to
himself
camusot
is
sure
to
have
done
something
silly
the
examining
magistrate
knocked
twice
at
the
door
of
his
room
well
my
dear
camusot
how
is
that
case
going
on
that
i
spoke
of
this
morning
badly
monsieur
le
comte
read
and
judge
for
he
held
out
the
minutes
of
the
two
examinations
to
monsieur
de
granville
who
took
up
his
eyeglass
and
went
to
the
window
to
read
them
he
had
soon
run
through
them
you
have
done
your
duty
said
the
count
in
an
agitated
voice
it
is
all
over
the
law
must
take
its
course
you
have
shown
so
much
skill
that
you
need
never
fear
being
deprived
of
your
appointment
as
examining
judge
if
monsieur
de
granville
had
said
to
camusot
you
will
remain
an
examining
judge
to
your
dying
day
he
could
not
have
been
more
explicit
than
in
making
this
polite
speech
camusot
was
cold
in
the
very
marrow
madame
la
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
to
whom
i
owe
much
had
desired
me
oh
yes
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
is
madame
de
serizy
s
friend
said
granville
interrupting
him
to
be
you
have
allowed
nothing
to
influence
you
i
perceive
and
you
did
well
sir
you
will
be
a
great
at
this
instant
the
comte
octave
de
bauvan
opened
the
door
without
knocking
and
said
to
the
comte
de
granville
i
have
brought
you
a
fair
lady
my
dear
fellow
who
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
she
was
on
the
point
of
losing
herself
in
our
labyrinth
and
comte
octave
led
in
by
the
hand
the
comtesse
de
serizy
who
had
been
wandering
about
the
place
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
what
you
here
madame
exclaimed
the
public
prosecutor
pushing
forward
his
own
armchair
and
at
this
moment
this
madame
is
monsieur
camusot
he
added
introducing
the
bauvan
said
he
to
the
distinguished
ministerial
orator
of
the
restoration
wait
for
me
in
the
president
s
chambers
he
is
still
there
and
i
will
join
comte
octave
de
bauvan
understood
that
not
merely
was
he
in
the
way
but
that
monsieur
de
granville
wanted
an
excuse
for
leaving
his
room
madame
de
serizy
had
not
made
the
mistake
of
coming
to
the
palais
de
justice
in
her
handsome
carriage
with
a
blue
and
her
coachman
in
gold
lace
and
two
footmen
in
breeches
and
silk
stockings
just
as
they
were
starting
asie
impressed
on
the
two
great
ladies
the
need
for
taking
the
hackney
coach
in
which
she
and
the
duchess
had
arrived
and
she
had
likewise
insisted
on
lucien
s
mistress
adopting
the
costume
which
is
to
women
what
a
gray
cloak
was
of
yore
to
men
the
countess
wore
a
plain
brown
dress
an
old
black
shawl
and
a
velvet
bonnet
from
which
the
flowers
had
been
removed
and
the
whole
covered
up
under
a
thick
lace
veil
you
received
our
note
said
she
to
camusot
whose
dismay
she
mistook
for
respectful
admiration
alas
but
too
late
madame
la
comtesse
replied
the
lawyer
whose
tact
and
wit
failed
him
excepting
in
his
chambers
and
in
presence
of
a
prisoner
too
late
how
she
looked
at
monsieur
de
granville
and
saw
consternation
written
in
his
face
it
can
not
be
it
must
not
be
too
late
she
added
in
the
tone
of
a
despot
women
pretty
women
in
the
position
of
madame
de
serizy
are
the
spoiled
children
of
french
civilization
if
the
women
of
other
countries
knew
what
a
woman
of
fashion
is
in
paris
a
woman
of
wealth
and
rank
they
would
all
want
to
come
and
enjoy
that
splendid
royalty
the
women
who
recognize
no
bonds
but
those
of
propriety
no
law
but
the
petty
charter
which
has
been
more
than
once
alluded
to
in
this
as
the
ladies
code
laugh
at
the
statutes
framed
by
men
they
say
everything
they
do
not
shrink
from
any
blunder
or
hesitate
at
any
folly
for
they
all
accept
the
fact
that
they
are
irresponsible
beings
answerable
for
nothing
on
earth
but
their
good
repute
and
their
children
they
say
the
most
preposterous
things
with
a
laugh
and
are
ready
on
every
occasion
to
repeat
the
speech
made
in
the
early
days
of
her
married
life
by
pretty
madame
de
bauvan
to
her
husband
whom
she
came
to
fetch
away
from
the
palais
make
haste
and
pass
sentence
and
come
madame
said
the
public
prosecutor
monsieur
lucien
de
rubempre
is
not
guilty
either
of
robbery
or
of
poisoning
but
monsieur
camusot
has
led
him
to
confess
a
still
greater
what
is
that
she
asked
he
acknowledged
said
monsieur
camusot
in
her
ear
that
he
is
the
friend
and
pupil
of
an
escaped
convict
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
the
spaniard
with
whom
he
has
been
living
for
the
last
seven
years
is
the
notorious
jacques
madame
de
serizy
felt
as
if
it
were
a
blow
from
an
iron
rod
at
each
word
spoken
by
the
judge
but
this
name
was
the
finishing
stroke
and
the
upshot
of
all
this
she
said
in
a
voice
that
was
no
more
than
a
breath
is
monsieur
de
granville
went
on
finishing
the
countess
sentence
in
an
undertone
that
the
convict
will
be
committed
for
trial
and
that
if
lucien
is
not
committed
with
him
as
having
profited
as
an
accessory
to
the
man
s
crimes
he
must
appear
as
a
witness
very
seriously
oh
never
never
she
cried
aloud
with
amazing
firmness
for
my
part
i
should
not
hesitate
between
death
and
the
disaster
of
seeing
a
man
whom
the
world
has
known
to
be
my
dearest
friend
declared
by
the
bench
to
be
the
accomplice
of
a
the
king
has
a
great
regard
for
my
husband
madame
said
the
public
prosecutor
also
aloud
and
with
a
smile
the
king
has
not
the
smallest
power
over
the
humblest
examining
judge
in
his
kingdom
nor
over
the
proceedings
in
any
court
of
justice
that
is
the
grand
feature
of
our
new
code
of
laws
i
myself
have
just
congratulated
camusot
on
his
skill
on
his
clumsiness
said
the
countess
sharply
though
lucien
s
intimacy
with
a
scoundrel
really
disturbed
her
far
less
than
his
attachment
to
esther
if
you
will
read
the
minutes
of
the
examination
of
the
two
prisoners
by
monsieur
camusot
you
will
see
that
everything
is
in
his
hands
after
this
speech
the
only
thing
the
public
prosecutor
could
venture
to
say
and
a
flash
of
feminine
or
if
you
will
cunning
he
went
to
the
door
then
turning
round
on
the
threshold
he
added
excuse
me
madame
i
have
two
words
to
say
to
which
translated
by
the
worldly
wise
conveyed
to
the
countess
i
do
not
want
to
witness
the
scene
between
you
and
what
is
this
examination
business
said
leontine
very
blandly
to
camusot
who
stood
downcast
in
the
presence
of
the
wife
of
one
of
the
most
important
personages
in
the
realm
madame
said
camusot
a
clerk
writes
down
all
the
magistrate
s
questions
and
the
prisoner
s
replies
this
document
is
signed
by
the
clerk
by
the
judge
and
by
the
prisoner
this
evidence
is
the
raw
material
of
the
subsequent
proceedings
on
it
the
accused
are
committed
for
trial
and
remanded
to
appear
before
the
criminal
well
then
said
she
if
the
evidence
were
suppressed
oh
madame
that
is
a
crime
which
no
magistrate
could
possibly
commit
a
crime
against
it
is
a
far
worse
crime
against
me
to
have
ever
allowed
it
to
be
recorded
still
at
this
moment
it
is
the
only
evidence
against
lucien
come
read
me
the
minutes
of
his
examination
that
i
may
see
if
there
is
still
a
way
of
salvation
for
us
all
monsieur
i
do
not
speak
for
myself
alone
i
should
quite
calmly
kill
myself
but
monsieur
de
serizy
s
happiness
is
also
at
pray
madame
do
not
suppose
that
i
have
forgotten
the
respect
due
you
said
camusot
if
monsieur
popinot
for
instance
had
undertaken
this
case
you
would
have
had
worse
luck
than
you
have
found
with
me
for
he
would
not
have
come
to
consult
monsieur
de
granville
no
one
would
have
heard
anything
about
it
i
tell
you
madame
everything
has
been
seized
in
monsieur
lucien
s
lodging
even
your
letters
what
my
letters
here
they
are
madame
in
a
sealed
the
countess
in
her
agitation
rang
as
if
she
had
been
at
home
and
the
came
in
a
light
said
she
the
boy
lighted
a
taper
and
placed
it
on
the
while
the
countess
looked
through
the
letters
counted
them
crushed
them
in
her
hand
and
flung
them
on
the
hearth
in
a
few
minutes
she
set
the
whole
mass
in
a
blaze
twisting
up
the
last
note
to
serve
as
a
torch
camusot
stood
looking
rather
foolish
as
he
watched
the
papers
burn
holding
the
legal
documents
in
his
hand
the
countess
who
seemed
absorbed
in
the
work
of
destroying
the
proofs
of
her
passion
studied
him
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
she
took
her
time
she
calculated
her
distance
with
the
spring
of
a
cat
she
seized
the
two
documents
and
threw
them
on
the
flames
but
camusot
saved
them
the
countess
rushed
on
him
and
snatched
back
the
burning
papers
a
struggle
ensued
camusot
calling
out
madame
but
madame
this
is
contempt
madame
a
man
hurried
into
the
room
and
the
countess
could
not
repress
a
scream
as
she
beheld
the
comte
de
serizy
followed
by
monsieur
de
granville
and
the
comte
de
bauvan
leontine
however
determined
to
save
lucien
at
any
cost
would
not
let
go
of
the
terrible
stamped
documents
which
she
clutched
with
the
tenacity
of
a
vise
though
the
flame
had
already
burnt
her
delicate
skin
like
a
moxa
at
last
camusot
whose
fingers
also
were
smarting
from
the
fire
seemed
to
be
ashamed
of
the
position
he
let
the
papers
go
there
was
nothing
left
of
them
but
the
portions
so
tightly
held
by
the
antagonists
that
the
flame
could
not
touch
them
the
whole
scene
had
taken
less
time
than
is
needed
to
read
this
account
of
it
what
discussion
can
have
arisen
between
you
and
madame
de
serizy
the
husband
asked
of
camusot
before
the
lawyer
could
reply
the
countess
held
the
fragments
in
the
candle
and
threw
them
on
the
remains
of
her
letters
which
were
not
entirely
consumed
i
shall
be
compelled
said
camusot
to
lay
a
complaint
against
madame
la
comtesse
heh
what
has
she
done
asked
the
public
prosecutor
looking
alternately
at
the
lady
and
the
magistrate
i
have
burned
the
record
of
the
examinations
said
the
lady
of
fashion
with
a
laugh
so
pleased
at
her
conduct
that
she
did
not
yet
feel
the
pain
of
the
burns
if
that
is
a
crime
well
monsieur
must
get
his
odious
scrawl
written
out
very
true
said
camusot
trying
to
recover
his
dignity
well
well
all
s
well
that
ends
well
said
monsieur
de
granville
but
my
dear
countess
you
must
not
often
take
such
liberties
with
the
law
it
might
fail
to
discern
who
and
what
you
monsieur
camusot
valiantly
resisted
a
woman
whom
none
can
resist
the
honor
of
the
robe
is
safe
said
the
comte
de
bauvan
laughing
indeed
monsieur
camusot
was
resisting
said
the
public
prosecutor
laughing
too
he
is
a
brave
man
indeed
i
should
not
dare
resist
the
and
thus
for
the
moment
this
serious
affair
was
no
more
than
a
pretty
woman
s
jest
at
which
camusot
himself
must
laugh
but
monsieur
de
granville
saw
one
man
who
was
not
amused
not
a
little
alarmed
by
the
comte
de
serizy
s
attitude
and
expression
his
friend
led
him
aside
my
dear
fellow
said
he
in
a
whisper
your
distress
persuades
me
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
my
life
to
compromise
with
my
the
public
prosecutor
rang
and
the
appeared
desire
monsieur
de
chargeboeuf
to
come
monsieur
de
chargeboeuf
a
sucking
barrister
was
his
private
secretary
my
good
friend
said
the
comte
de
granville
to
camusot
whom
he
took
to
the
window
go
back
to
your
chambers
get
your
clerk
to
reconstruct
the
report
of
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
s
depositions
as
he
had
not
signed
the
first
copy
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
that
you
must
confront
your
spanish
diplomate
with
rastignac
and
bianchon
who
will
not
recognize
him
as
jacques
collin
then
being
sure
of
his
release
the
man
will
sign
the
document
as
to
lucien
de
rubempre
set
him
free
this
evening
he
is
not
likely
to
talk
about
an
examination
of
which
the
evidence
is
destroyed
especially
after
such
a
lecture
as
i
shall
give
him
now
you
will
see
how
little
justice
suffers
by
these
proceedings
if
the
spaniard
really
is
the
convict
we
have
fifty
ways
of
recapturing
him
and
committing
him
for
trial
for
we
will
have
his
conduct
in
spain
thoroughly
investigated
corentin
the
police
agent
will
take
care
of
him
for
us
and
we
ourselves
will
keep
an
eye
on
him
so
treat
him
decently
do
not
send
him
down
to
the
cells
again
can
we
be
the
death
of
the
comte
and
comtesse
de
serizy
as
well
as
of
lucien
for
the
theft
of
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
as
yet
unproven
and
to
lucien
s
personal
loss
will
it
not
be
better
for
him
to
lose
the
money
than
to
lose
his
character
above
all
if
he
is
to
drag
with
him
in
his
fall
a
minister
of
state
and
his
wife
and
the
duchesse
du
maufrigneuse
this
young
man
is
a
speckled
orange
do
not
leave
it
to
rot
all
this
will
take
you
about
half
an
hour
go
and
get
it
done
we
will
wait
for
you
it
is
three
you
will
find
some
judges
about
let
me
know
if
you
can
get
a
rule
of
insufficient
evidence
or
lucien
must
wait
till
camusot
bowed
to
the
company
and
went
but
madame
de
serizy
who
was
suffering
a
good
deal
from
her
burns
did
not
return
his
bow
monsieur
de
serizy
who
had
suddenly
rushed
away
while
the
public
prosecutor
and
the
magistrate
were
talking
together
presently
returned
having
fetched
a
small
jar
of
virgin
wax
with
this
he
dressed
his
wife
s
fingers
saying
in
an
undertone
leontine
why
did
you
come
here
without
letting
me
know
my
dear
replied
she
in
a
whisper
forgive
me
i
seem
mad
but
indeed
your
interests
were
as
much
involved
as
love
this
young
fellow
if
fatality
requires
it
but
do
not
display
your
passion
to
all
the
world
said
the
luckless
husband
well
my
dear
countess
said
monsieur
de
granville
who
had
been
engaged
in
conversation
with
comte
octave
i
hope
you
may
take
monsieur
de
rubempre
home
to
dine
with
you
this
this
half
promise
produced
a
reaction
madame
de
serizy
melted
into
tears
i
thought
i
had
no
tears
left
said
she
with
a
smile
but
could
you
not
bring
monsieur
de
rubempre
to
wait
here
i
will
try
if
i
can
find
the
ushers
to
fetch
him
so
that
he
may
not
be
seen
under
the
escort
of
the
gendarmes
said
monsieur
de
granville
you
are
as
good
as
god
cried
she
with
a
gush
of
feeling
that
made
her
voice
sound
like
heavenly
music
these
are
the
women
said
comte
octave
who
are
fascinating
irresistible
and
he
became
melancholy
as
he
thought
of
his
own
wife
see
as
he
left
the
room
monsieur
de
granville
was
stopped
by
young
chargeboeuf
to
whom
he
spoke
to
give
him
instructions
as
to
what
he
was
to
say
to
massol
one
of
the
editors
of
the
des
while
beauties
ministers
and
magistrates
were
conspiring
to
save
lucien
this
was
what
he
was
doing
at
the
conciergerie
as
he
passed
the
gate
the
poet
told
the
keeper
that
monsieur
camusot
had
granted
him
leave
to
write
and
he
begged
to
have
pens
ink
and
paper
at
a
whispered
word
to
the
governor
from
camusot
s
usher
a
warder
was
instructed
to
take
them
to
him
at
once
during
the
short
time
that
it
took
for
the
warder
to
fetch
these
things
and
carry
them
up
to
lucien
the
hapless
young
man
to
whom
the
idea
of
facing
jacques
collin
had
become
intolerable
sank
into
one
of
those
fatal
moods
in
which
the
idea
of
suicide
to
which
he
had
yielded
before
now
but
without
succeeding
in
carrying
it
out
rises
to
the
pitch
of
mania
according
to
certain
suicide
is
in
some
temperaments
the
closing
phase
of
mental
aberration
and
since
his
arrest
lucien
had
been
possessed
by
that
single
idea
esther
s
letter
read
and
reread
many
times
increased
the
vehemence
of
his
desire
to
die
by
reminding
him
of
the
catastrophe
of
romeo
dying
to
be
with
juliet
this
is
what
he
wrote
is
my
last
will
and
at
the
conciergerie

enclosed
in
a
letter
addressed
to
monsieur
le
comte
de
granville
public
prosecutor
in
the
supreme
court
at
paris
as
follows
monsieur
le
comte
i
place
my
will
in
your
hands
when
you
open
this
letter
i
shall
be
no
more
in
my
desire
to
be
free
i
made
such
cowardly
replies
to
monsieur
camusot
s
insidious
questions
that
in
spite
of
my
innocence
i
may
find
myself
entangled
in
a
disgraceful
trial
even
if
i
were
acquitted
a
blameless
life
would
henceforth
be
impossible
to
me
in
view
of
the
opinions
of
the
world
i
beg
you
to
transmit
the
enclosed
letter
to
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
without
opening
it
and
deliver
to
monsieur
camusot
the
formal
retraction
i
also
enclose
i
suppose
no
one
will
dare
to
break
the
seal
of
a
packet
addressed
to
you
in
this
belief
i
bid
you
adieu
offering
you
my
best
respects
for
the
last
time
and
begging
you
to
believe
that
in
writing
to
you
i
am
giving
you
a
token
of
my
gratitude
for
all
the
kindness
you
have
shown
to
your
deceased
humble
servant
lucien
de
the
abbe
carlos
my
dear
abbe
i
have
had
only
benefits
from
you
and
i
have
betrayed
you
this
involuntary
ingratitude
is
killing
me
and
when
you
read
these
lines
i
shall
have
ceased
to
exist
you
are
not
here
now
to
save
me
you
had
given
me
full
liberty
if
i
should
find
it
advantageous
to
destroy
you
by
flinging
you
on
the
ground
like
a
but
i
have
ruined
you
by
a
blunder
to
escape
from
a
difficulty
deluded
by
a
clever
question
from
the
examining
judge
your
son
by
adoption
and
grace
went
over
to
the
side
of
those
who
aim
at
killing
you
at
any
cost
and
insist
on
proving
an
identity
which
i
know
to
be
impossible
between
you
and
a
french
villain
all
is
said
between
a
man
of
your
calibre
and
me
me
of
whom
you
tried
to
make
a
greater
man
than
i
am
capable
of
being
no
foolish
sentiment
can
come
at
the
moment
of
final
parting
you
hoped
to
make
me
powerful
and
famous
and
you
have
thrown
me
into
the
gulf
of
suicide
that
is
all
i
have
long
heard
the
broad
pinions
of
that
vertigo
beating
over
my
head
as
you
have
sometimes
said
there
is
the
posterity
of
cain
and
the
posterity
of
abel
in
the
great
human
drama
cain
is
in
opposition
you
are
descended
from
adam
through
that
line
in
which
the
devil
still
fans
the
fire
of
which
the
first
spark
was
flung
on
eve
among
the
demons
of
that
pedigree
from
time
to
time
we
see
one
of
stupendous
power
summing
up
every
form
of
human
energy
and
resembling
the
fevered
beasts
of
the
desert
whose
vitality
demands
the
vast
spaces
they
find
there
such
men
are
as
dangerous
as
lions
would
be
in
the
heart
of
normandy
they
must
have
their
prey
and
they
devour
common
men
and
crop
the
money
of
fools
their
sport
is
so
dangerous
that
at
last
they
kill
the
humble
dog
whom
they
have
taken
for
a
companion
and
made
an
idol
of
when
it
is
god
s
will
these
mysterious
beings
may
be
a
moses
an
attila
charlemagne
mahomet
or
napoleon
but
when
he
leaves
a
generation
of
these
stupendous
tools
to
rust
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
they
are
no
more
than
a
pugatschef
a
fouche
a
louvel
or
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
gifted
with
immense
power
over
tenderer
souls
they
entrap
them
and
mangle
them
it
is
grand
it
is
fine
in
its
way
it
is
the
poisonous
plant
with
gorgeous
coloring
that
fascinates
children
in
the
woods
it
is
the
poetry
of
evil
men
like
you
ought
to
dwell
in
caves
and
never
come
out
of
them
you
have
made
me
live
that
vast
life
and
i
have
had
all
my
share
of
existence
so
i
may
very
well
take
my
head
out
of
the
gordian
knot
of
your
policy
and
slip
it
into
the
running
knot
of
my
cravat
to
repair
the
mischief
i
have
done
i
am
forwarding
to
the
public
prosecutor
a
retraction
of
my
deposition
you
will
know
how
to
take
advantage
of
this
document
in
virtue
of
a
will
formally
drawn
up
restitution
will
be
made
monsieur
l
abbe
of
the
moneys
belonging
to
your
order
which
you
so
imprudently
devoted
to
my
use
as
a
result
of
your
paternal
affection
for
me
and
so
farewell
farewell
colossal
image
of
evil
and
corruption
farewell
to
you
who
if
started
on
the
right
road
might
have
been
greater
than
ximenes
greater
than
richelieu
you
have
kept
your
promises
i
find
myself
once
more
just
as
i
was
on
the
banks
of
the
charente
after
enjoying
by
your
help
the
enchantments
of
a
dream
but
unfortunately
it
is
not
now
in
the
waters
of
my
native
place
that
i
shall
drown
the
errors
of
a
boy
but
in
the
seine
and
my
hole
is
a
cell
in
the
conciergerie
do
not
regret
me
my
contempt
for
you
is
as
great
as
my
admiration
i
the
undersigned
hereby
declare
that
i
retract
without
reservation
all
that
i
deposed
at
my
examination
before
monsieur
camusot
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
always
called
himself
my
spiritual
father
and
i
was
misled
by
the
word
father
used
in
another
sense
by
the
judge
no
doubt
under
a
misapprehension
i
am
aware
that
for
political
ends
and
to
quash
certain
secrets
concerning
the
cabinets
of
spain
and
of
the
tuileries
some
obscure
diplomatic
agents
tried
to
show
that
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
was
a
forger
named
jacques
collin
but
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
never
told
me
anything
about
the
matter
excepting
that
he
was
doing
his
best
to
obtain
evidence
of
the
death
or
of
the
continued
existence
of
jacques
collin
lucien
de
rubempre
at
the
conciergerie
may
the
fever
for
suicide
had
given
lucien
immense
clearness
of
mind
and
the
swiftness
of
hand
familiar
to
authors
in
the
fever
of
composition
the
impetus
was
so
strong
within
him
that
these
four
documents
were
all
written
within
half
an
hour
he
folded
them
in
a
wrapper
fastened
with
wafers
on
which
he
impressed
with
the
strength
of
delirium
the
engraved
on
a
he
wore
and
he
then
laid
the
packet
very
conspicuously
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
certainly
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
conduct
himself
with
greater
dignity
in
the
false
position
to
which
all
this
infamy
had
led
him
he
was
rescuing
his
memory
from
opprobrium
and
repairing
the
injury
done
to
his
accomplice
so
far
as
the
wit
of
a
man
of
the
world
could
nullify
the
result
of
the
poet
s
trustfulness
if
lucien
had
been
taken
back
to
one
of
the
lower
cells
he
would
have
been
wrecked
on
the
impossibility
of
carrying
out
his
intentions
for
those
boxes
of
masonry
have
no
furniture
but
a
sort
of
and
a
pail
for
necessary
uses
there
is
not
a
nail
not
a
chair
not
even
a
stool
the
is
so
firmly
fixed
that
it
is
impossible
to
move
it
without
an
amount
of
labor
that
the
warder
would
not
fail
to
detect
for
the
peephole
is
always
open
indeed
if
a
prisoner
under
suspicion
gives
reason
for
uneasiness
he
is
watched
by
a
gendarme
or
a
constable
in
the
private
rooms
for
which
prisoners
pay
and
in
that
whither
lucien
had
been
conveyed
by
the
judge
s
courtesy
to
a
young
man
belonging
to
the
upper
ranks
of
society
the
movable
bed
table
and
chair
might
serve
to
carry
out
his
purpose
of
suicide
though
they
hardly
made
it
easy
lucien
wore
a
long
blue
silk
necktie
and
on
his
way
back
from
examination
he
was
already
meditating
on
the
means
by
which
pichegru
more
or
less
voluntarily
ended
his
days
still
to
hang
himself
a
man
must
find
a
purchase
and
have
a
sufficient
space
between
it
and
the
ground
for
his
feet
to
find
no
support
now
the
window
of
his
room
looking
out
on
the
had
no
handle
to
the
fastening
and
the
bars
being
fixed
outside
were
divided
from
his
reach
by
the
thickness
of
the
wall
and
could
not
be
used
for
a
support
this
then
was
the
plan
hit
upon
by
lucien
to
put
himself
out
of
the
world
the
boarding
of
the
lower
part
of
the
opening
which
prevented
his
seeing
out
into
the
yard
also
hindered
the
warders
outside
from
seeing
what
was
done
in
the
room
but
while
the
lower
portion
of
the
window
was
replaced
by
two
thick
planks
the
upper
part
of
both
halves
still
was
filled
with
small
panes
held
in
place
by
the
cross
pieces
in
which
they
were
set
by
standing
on
his
table
lucien
could
reach
the
glazed
part
of
the
window
and
take
or
break
out
two
panes
so
as
to
have
a
firm
point
of
attachment
in
the
angle
of
the
lower
bar
round
this
he
would
tie
his
cravat
turn
round
once
to
tighten
it
round
his
neck
after
securing
it
firmly
and
kick
the
table
from
under
his
feet
he
drew
the
table
up
under
the
window
without
making
any
noise
took
off
his
coat
and
waistcoat
and
got
on
the
table
unhesitatingly
to
break
a
pane
above
and
one
below
the
iron
standing
on
the
table
he
could
look
out
across
the
yard
on
a
magical
view
which
he
then
beheld
for
the
first
time
the
governor
of
the
prison
in
deference
to
monsieur
camusot
s
request
that
he
should
deal
as
leniently
as
possible
with
lucien
had
led
him
as
we
have
seen
through
the
dark
passages
of
the
conciergerie
entered
from
the
dark
vault
opposite
the
tour
d
argent
thus
avoiding
the
exhibition
of
a
young
man
of
fashion
to
the
crowd
of
prisoners
airing
themselves
in
the
yard
it
will
be
for
the
reader
to
judge
whether
the
aspect
of
the
promenade
was
not
such
as
to
appeal
deeply
to
a
poet
s
soul
the
yard
of
the
conciergerie
ends
at
the
quai
between
the
tour
d
argent
and
the
tour
bonbec
thus
the
distance
between
them
exactly
shows
from
the
outside
the
width
of
the
plot
of
ground
the
corridor
called
the
galerie
de
which
extends
from
the
galerie
marchande
to
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
tour
bonbec
in
which
it
is
said
room
still
exists
may
enable
the
curious
to
estimate
the
depths
of
the
yard
as
it
is
of
the
same
length
thus
the
dark
cells
and
the
private
rooms
are
under
the
galerie
marchande
and
queen
marie
antoinette
whose
dungeon
was
under
the
present
cells
was
conducted
to
the
presence
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
which
held
its
sittings
in
the
place
where
the
court
of
appeals
now
performs
its
solemn
functions
up
a
horrible
flight
of
steps
now
never
used
in
the
very
thickness
of
the
wall
on
which
the
galerie
marchande
is
built
one
side
of
the
that
on
which
the
hall
of
forms
the
first
floor
displays
a
long
row
of
gothic
columns
between
which
the
architects
of
i
know
not
what
period
have
built
up
two
floors
of
cells
to
accommodate
as
many
prisoners
as
possible
by
choking
the
capitals
the
arches
and
the
vaults
of
this
magnificent
cloister
with
plaster
barred
loopholes
and
partitions
under
the
room
known
as
the
cabinet
de
in
the
tour
bonbec
there
is
a
spiral
stair
leading
to
these
dens
this
degradation
of
one
of
the
immemorial
buildings
of
france
is
hideous
to
behold
from
the
height
at
which
lucien
was
standing
he
saw
this
cloister
and
the
details
of
the
building
that
joins
the
two
towers
in
sharp
perspective
before
him
were
the
pointed
caps
of
the
towers
he
stood
amazed
his
suicide
was
postponed
to
his
admiration
the
phenomena
of
hallucination
are
in
these
days
so
fully
recognized
by
the
medical
faculty
that
this
mirage
of
the
senses
this
strange
illusion
of
the
mind
is
beyond
dispute
a
man
under
the
stress
of
a
feeling
which
by
its
intensity
has
become
a
monomania
often
finds
himself
in
the
frame
of
mind
to
which
opium
hasheesh
or
the
protoxyde
of
azote
might
have
brought
him
spectres
appear
phantoms
and
dreams
take
shape
things
of
the
past
live
again
as
they
once
were
what
was
but
an
image
of
the
brain
becomes
a
moving
or
a
living
object
science
is
now
beginning
to
believe
that
under
the
action
of
a
paroxysm
of
passion
the
blood
rushes
to
the
brain
and
that
such
congestion
has
the
terrible
effects
of
a
dream
in
a
waking
state
so
averse
are
we
to
regard
thought
as
a
physical
and
generative
force
see
lucien
saw
the
building
in
all
its
pristine
beauty
the
columns
were
new
slender
and
bright
palace
rose
before
him
as
it
had
once
appeared
he
admired
its
babylonian
proportions
and
oriental
fancy
he
took
this
exquisite
vision
as
a
poetic
farewell
from
civilized
creation
while
making
his
arrangements
to
die
he
wondered
how
this
marvel
of
architecture
could
exist
in
paris
so
utterly
unknown
he
was
two
luciens
one
lucien
the
poet
wandering
through
the
middle
ages
under
the
vaults
and
the
turrets
of
the
other
lucien
ready
for
suicide
just
as
monsieur
de
granville
had
ended
giving
his
instructions
to
the
young
secretary
the
governor
of
the
conciergerie
came
in
and
the
expression
of
his
face
was
such
as
to
give
the
public
prosecutor
a
presentiment
of
disaster
have
you
met
monsieur
camusot
he
asked
no
monsieur
said
the
governor
his
clerk
coquart
instructed
me
to
give
the
abbe
carlos
a
private
room
and
to
liberate
monsieur
de
rubempre
but
it
is
too
good
god
what
has
happened
here
monsieur
is
a
letter
for
you
which
will
explain
the
catastrophe
the
warder
on
duty
in
the
heard
a
noise
of
breaking
glass
in
the
upper
room
and
monsieur
lucien
s
next
neighbor
shrieking
wildly
for
he
heard
the
young
man
s
dying
struggles
the
warder
came
to
me
pale
from
the
sight
that
met
his
eyes
he
found
the
prisoner
hanged
from
the
window
bar
by
his
though
the
governor
spoke
in
a
low
voice
a
fearful
scream
from
madame
de
serizy
showed
that
under
stress
of
feeling
our
faculties
are
incalculably
keen
the
countess
heard
or
guessed
before
monsieur
de
granville
could
turn
round
or
monsieur
de
bauvan
or
her
husband
could
stop
her
she
fled
like
a
flash
out
of
the
door
and
reached
the
galerie
marchande
where
she
ran
on
to
the
stairs
leading
out
to
the
rue
de
la
barillerie
a
pleader
was
taking
off
his
gown
at
the
door
of
one
of
the
shops
which
from
time
immemorial
have
choked
up
this
arcade
where
shoes
are
sold
and
gowns
and
caps
kept
for
hire
the
countess
asked
the
way
to
the
conciergerie
go
down
the
steps
and
turn
to
the
left
the
entrance
is
from
the
quai
de
l
horloge
the
first
that
woman
is
crazy
said
the
some
one
ought
to
follow
but
no
one
could
have
kept
up
with
leontine
she
flew
a
physician
may
explain
how
it
is
that
these
ladies
of
fashion
whose
strength
never
finds
employment
reveal
such
powers
in
the
critical
moments
of
life
the
countess
rushed
so
swiftly
through
the
archway
to
the
that
the
gendarme
on
sentry
did
not
see
her
pass
she
flew
at
the
barred
gate
like
a
feather
driven
by
the
wind
and
shook
the
iron
bars
with
such
fury
that
she
broke
the
one
she
grasped
the
bent
ends
were
thrust
into
her
breast
making
the
blood
flow
and
she
dropped
on
the
ground
shrieking
open
it
open
it
in
a
tone
that
struck
terror
into
the
warders
the
gatekeepers
hurried
out
open
the
gate
the
public
prosecutor
sent
me
to
save
the
dead
man
while
the
countess
was
going
round
by
the
rue
de
la
barillerie
and
the
quai
de
l
horloge
monsieur
de
granville
and
monsieur
de
serizy
went
down
to
the
conciergerie
through
the
inner
passages
suspecting
leontine
s
purpose
but
notwithstanding
their
haste
they
only
arrived
in
time
to
see
her
fall
fainting
at
the
outer
gate
where
she
was
picked
up
by
two
gendarmes
who
had
come
down
from
the
guardroom
on
seeing
the
governor
of
the
prison
the
gate
was
opened
and
the
countess
was
carried
into
the
office
but
she
stood
up
and
fell
on
her
knees
clasping
her
hands
only
to
see
him
to
see
him
oh
i
will
do
no
wrong
but
if
you
do
not
want
to
see
me
die
on
the
spot
let
me
look
at
lucien
dead
or
ah
my
dear
are
you
here
choose
between
my
death
and
she
sank
in
a
heap
you
are
kind
she
said
i
will
always
love
you
carry
her
away
said
monsieur
de
bauvan
no
we
will
go
to
lucien
s
cell
said
monsieur
de
granville
reading
a
purpose
in
monsieur
de
serizy
s
wild
looks
and
he
lifted
up
the
countess
and
took
her
under
one
arm
while
monsieur
de
bauvan
supported
her
on
the
other
side
monsieur
said
the
comte
de
serizy
to
the
governor
silence
as
of
the
grave
about
all
be
easy
replied
the
governor
you
have
done
the
wisest
if
this
lady
she
is
my
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
well
she
will
certainly
faint
away
when
she
sees
the
poor
man
and
while
she
is
unconscious
she
can
be
taken
home
in
a
carriage
that
is
what
i
thought
replied
the
count
pray
send
one
of
your
men
to
tell
my
servants
in
the
cour
de
harlay
to
come
round
to
the
gate
mine
is
the
only
carriage
we
can
save
him
yet
said
the
countess
walking
on
with
a
degree
of
strength
and
spirit
that
surprised
her
friends
there
are
ways
of
restoring
life
and
she
dragged
the
gentlemen
along
crying
to
the
warder
come
on
come
faster
one
second
may
cost
three
lives
when
the
cell
door
was
opened
and
the
countess
saw
lucien
hanging
as
though
his
clothes
had
been
hung
on
a
peg
she
made
a
spring
towards
him
as
if
to
embrace
him
and
cling
to
him
but
she
fell
on
her
face
on
the
floor
with
smothered
shrieks
and
a
sort
of
rattle
in
her
throat
five
minutes
later
she
was
being
taken
home
stretched
on
the
seat
in
the
count
s
carriage
her
husband
kneeling
by
her
side
monsieur
de
bauvan
went
off
to
fetch
a
doctor
to
give
her
the
care
she
needed
the
governor
of
the
conciergerie
meanwhile
was
examining
the
outer
gate
and
saying
to
his
clerk
no
expense
was
spared
the
bars
are
of
wrought
iron
they
were
properly
tested
and
cost
a
large
sum
and
yet
there
was
a
flaw
in
that
monsieur
de
granville
on
returning
to
his
room
had
other
instructions
to
give
to
his
private
secretary
massol
happily
had
not
yet
arrived
soon
after
monsieur
de
granville
had
left
anxious
to
go
to
see
monsieur
de
serizy
massol
came
and
found
his
ally
chargeboeuf
in
the
public
prosecutor
s
court
my
dear
fellow
said
the
young
secretary
if
you
will
do
me
a
great
favor
you
will
put
what
i
dictate
to
you
in
your
under
the
heading
of
law
reports
you
can
compose
the
heading
write
and
he
dictated
as
follows
it
has
been
ascertained
that
the
demoiselle
esther
gobseck
killed
herself
of
her
own
free
will
monsieur
lucien
de
rubempre
satisfactorily
proved
an
alibi
and
his
innocence
leaves
his
arrest
to
be
regretted
all
the
more
because
just
as
the
examining
judge
had
given
the
order
for
his
release
the
young
gentleman
died
i
need
not
point
out
to
you
said
the
young
lawyer
to
massol
how
necessary
it
is
to
preserve
absolute
silence
as
to
the
little
service
requested
of
since
it
is
you
who
do
me
the
honor
of
so
much
confidence
replied
massol
allow
me
to
make
one
observation
this
paragraph
will
give
rise
to
odious
comments
on
the
course
of
justice
justice
is
strong
enough
to
bear
them
said
the
young
attache
to
the
courts
with
the
pride
of
a
coming
magistrate
trained
by
monsieur
de
granville
allow
me
my
dear
sir
with
two
sentences
this
difficulty
may
be
and
the
wrote
as
follows
the
forms
of
the
law
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
sad
event
the
examination
which
was
at
once
made
proved
that
sudden
death
was
due
to
the
rupture
of
an
aneurism
in
its
last
stage
if
monsieur
lucien
de
rubempre
had
been
upset
by
his
arrest
death
must
have
ensued
sooner
but
we
are
in
a
position
to
state
that
far
from
being
distressed
at
being
taken
into
custody
the
young
man
whom
all
must
lament
only
laughed
at
it
and
told
those
who
escorted
him
from
fontainebleau
to
paris
that
as
soon
as
he
was
brought
before
a
magistrate
his
innocence
would
be
that
saves
it
i
think
said
massol
you
are
perfectly
the
public
prosecutor
will
thank
you
for
it
said
massol
slyly
now
to
the
great
majority
as
to
the
more
choice
reader
it
will
perhaps
seem
that
this
study
is
not
completed
by
the
death
of
esther
and
of
lucien
jacques
collin
and
asie
europe
and
paccard
in
spite
of
their
villainous
lives
may
have
been
interesting
enough
to
make
their
fate
a
matter
of
curiosity
the
last
act
of
the
drama
will
also
complete
the
picture
of
life
which
this
study
is
intended
to
present
and
give
the
issue
of
various
interests
which
lucien
s
career
had
strangely
tangled
by
bringing
some
ignoble
personages
from
the
hulks
into
contact
with
those
of
the
highest
rank
thus
as
may
be
seen
the
greatest
events
of
life
find
their
expression
in
the
more
or
less
veracious
gossip
of
the
paris
papers
and
this
is
the
case
with
many
things
of
greater
importance
than
are
here
recorded
vautrin
s
last
avatar
what
is
it
madeleine
asked
madame
camusot
seeing
her
maid
come
into
the
room
with
the
particular
air
that
servants
assume
in
critical
moments
madame
said
madeleine
monsieur
has
just
come
in
from
court
but
he
looks
so
upset
and
is
in
such
a
state
that
i
think
perhaps
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
go
to
his
did
he
say
anything
asked
madame
camusot
no
madame
but
we
never
have
seen
monsieur
look
like
that
he
looks
as
if
he
were
going
to
be
ill
his
face
is
yellow
he
seems
all
to
pieces
madame
camusot
waited
for
no
more
she
rushed
out
of
her
room
and
flew
to
her
husband
s
study
she
found
the
lawyer
sitting
in
an
armchair
pale
and
dazed
his
legs
stretched
out
his
head
against
the
back
of
it
his
hands
hanging
limp
exactly
as
if
he
were
sinking
into
idiotcy
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
said
the
young
woman
in
alarm
oh
my
poor
amelie
the
most
dreadful
thing
has
happened
i
am
still
trembling
imagine
the
public
prosecutor
no
madame
de
serizy
that
is
i
do
not
know
where
to
begin
at
the
end
said
madame
camusot
well
just
as
monsieur
popinot
in
the
council
room
of
the
first
court
had
put
the
last
signature
to
the
ruling
of
insufficient
cause
for
the
apprehension
of
lucien
de
rubempre
on
the
ground
of
my
report
setting
him
at
liberty
in
fact
the
whole
thing
was
done
the
clerk
was
going
off
with
the
minute
book
and
i
was
quit
of
the
whole
business
the
president
of
the
court
came
in
and
took
up
the
papers
you
are
releasing
a
dead
man
said
he
with
chilly
irony
the
young
man
is
gone
as
monsieur
de
bonald
says
to
appear
before
his
natural
judge
he
died
of
apoplexy
i
breathed
again
thinking
it
was
sudden
illness
as
i
understand
you
monsieur
le
president
said
monsieur
popinot
it
is
a
case
of
apoplexy
like
pichegru
gentlemen
said
the
president
then
very
gravely
you
must
please
to
understand
that
for
the
outside
world
lucien
de
rubempre
died
of
an
we
all
looked
at
each
other
very
great
people
are
concerned
in
this
deplorable
business
said
the
president
god
grant
for
your
sake
monsieur
camusot
though
you
did
no
less
than
your
duty
that
madame
de
serizy
may
not
go
mad
from
the
shock
she
has
had
she
was
carried
away
almost
dead
i
have
just
met
our
public
prosecutor
in
a
painful
state
of
you
have
made
a
mess
of
it
my
dear
camusot
he
added
in
my
i
assure
you
my
dear
as
i
came
away
i
could
hardly
stand
my
legs
shook
so
that
i
dared
not
venture
into
the
street
i
went
back
to
my
room
to
rest
then
coquart
who
was
putting
away
the
papers
of
this
wretched
case
told
me
that
a
very
handsome
woman
had
taken
the
conciergerie
by
storm
wanting
to
save
lucien
whom
she
was
quite
crazy
about
and
that
she
fainted
away
on
seeing
him
hanging
by
his
necktie
to
the
of
his
room
the
idea
that
the
way
in
which
i
questioned
that
unhappy
young
fellow
who
between
ourselves
was
guilty
in
many
ways
can
have
led
to
his
committing
suicide
has
haunted
me
ever
since
i
left
the
palais
and
i
feel
constantly
on
the
point
of
fainting
what
next
are
you
going
to
think
yourself
a
murderer
because
a
suspected
criminal
hangs
himself
in
prison
just
as
you
were
about
to
release
him
cried
madame
camusot
why
an
examining
judge
in
such
a
case
is
like
a
general
whose
horse
is
killed
under
him
that
is
such
a
comparison
my
dear
is
at
best
but
a
jest
and
jesting
is
out
of
place
now
in
this
case
the
dead
man
clutches
the
living
all
our
hopes
are
buried
in
lucien
s
indeed
said
madame
camusot
with
deep
irony
yes
my
career
is
closed
i
shall
be
no
more
than
an
examining
judge
all
my
life
before
this
fatal
termination
monsieur
de
granville
was
annoyed
at
the
turn
the
preliminaries
had
taken
his
speech
to
our
president
makes
me
quite
certain
that
so
long
as
monsieur
de
granville
is
public
prosecutor
i
shall
get
no
promotion
the
terrible
thought
which
in
these
days
makes
a
judge
a
mere
functionary
formerly
a
magistrate
was
made
at
once
what
he
was
to
remain
the
three
or
four
presidents
caps
satisfied
the
ambitions
of
lawyers
in
each
parlement
an
appointment
as
councillor
was
enough
for
a
de
brosses
or
a
mole
at
dijon
as
much
as
in
paris
this
office
in
itself
a
fortune
required
a
fortune
brought
to
it
to
keep
it
up
in
paris
outside
the
parlement
men
of
the
long
robe
could
hope
only
for
three
supreme
appointments
those
of
keeper
of
the
seals
or
chancellor
below
the
parlement
in
the
lower
grades
the
president
of
a
lower
court
thought
himself
quite
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
content
to
fill
his
chair
to
the
end
of
his
days
compare
the
position
of
a
councillor
in
the
high
court
of
justice
in
paris
in
who
has
nothing
but
his
salary
with
that
of
a
councillor
to
the
parlement
in
how
great
is
the
difference
in
these
days
when
money
is
the
universal
social
guarantee
magistrates
are
not
required
to
have
as
they
used
to
have
fine
private
fortunes
hence
we
see
deputies
and
peers
of
france
heaping
office
on
office
at
once
magistrates
and
legislators
borrowing
dignity
from
other
positions
than
those
which
ought
to
give
them
all
their
importance
in
short
a
magistrate
tries
to
distinguish
himself
for
promotion
as
men
do
in
the
army
or
in
a
government
office
this
prevailing
thought
even
if
it
does
not
affect
his
independence
is
so
well
known
and
so
natural
and
its
effects
are
so
evident
that
the
law
inevitably
loses
some
of
its
majesty
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
and
in
fact
the
salaries
paid
by
the
state
makes
priests
and
magistrates
mere
steps
to
be
gained
foster
ambition
ambition
engenders
subservience
to
power
and
modern
equality
places
the
judge
and
the
person
to
be
judged
in
the
same
category
at
the
bar
of
society
and
so
the
two
pillars
of
social
order
religion
and
justice
are
lowered
in
this
nineteenth
century
which
asserts
itself
as
progressive
in
all
things
and
why
should
you
never
be
promoted
said
amelie
camusot
she
looked
at
her
husband
feeling
the
necessity
of
reviving
the
energies
of
the
man
who
embodied
her
ambitions
and
on
whom
she
could
play
as
on
an
instrument
why
despair
she
went
on
with
a
shrug
that
sufficiently
expressed
her
indifference
as
to
the
prisoner
s
end
this
suicide
will
delight
lucien
s
two
enemies
madame
d
espard
and
her
cousin
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
madame
d
espard
is
on
the
best
terms
with
the
keeper
of
the
seals
through
her
you
can
get
an
audience
of
his
excellency
and
tell
him
all
the
secrets
of
this
business
then
if
the
head
of
the
law
is
on
your
side
what
have
you
to
fear
from
the
president
of
your
court
or
the
public
prosecutor
but
monsieur
and
madame
de
serizy
cried
the
poor
man
madame
de
serizy
is
gone
mad
i
tell
you
and
her
madness
is
my
doing
they
well
if
she
is
out
of
her
mind
o
judge
devoid
of
judgment
said
madame
camusot
laughing
she
can
do
you
no
come
tell
me
all
the
incidents
of
the
bless
me
said
camusot
just
as
i
had
the
unhappy
youth
and
he
had
deposed
that
the
spanish
priest
is
really
jacques
collin
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
and
madame
de
serizy
sent
me
a
note
by
a
servant
begging
me
not
to
examine
him
it
was
all
over
but
you
must
have
lost
your
head
said
amelie
what
was
to
prevent
you
being
so
sure
as
you
are
of
your
clerk
s
fidelity
from
calling
lucien
back
reassuring
him
cleverly
and
revising
the
examination
why
you
are
as
bad
as
madame
de
serizy
you
laugh
justice
to
scorn
said
camusot
who
was
incapable
of
flouting
his
profession
madame
de
serizy
seized
the
minutes
and
threw
them
into
the
that
is
the
right
sort
of
woman
bravo
cried
madame
camusot
madame
de
serizy
declared
she
would
sooner
see
the
palais
blown
up
than
leave
a
young
man
who
had
enjoyed
the
favors
of
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
and
her
own
to
stand
at
the
bar
of
a
criminal
court
by
the
side
of
a
convict
but
camusot
said
amelie
unable
to
suppress
a
superior
smile
your
position
is
splendid
ah
yes
splendid
you
did
your
but
all
wrong
and
in
spite
of
the
jesuitical
advice
of
monsieur
de
granville
who
met
me
on
the
quai
this
morning
this
at
what
hour
at
nine
o
oh
camusot
cried
amelie
clasping
and
wringing
her
hands
and
i
am
always
imploring
you
to
be
constantly
on
the
good
heavens
it
is
not
a
man
but
a
of
stones
that
i
have
to
drag
on
why
camusot
your
public
prosecutor
was
waiting
for
he
must
have
given
you
some
yes
indeed
and
you
failed
to
understand
him
if
you
are
so
deaf
you
will
indeed
be
an
examining
judge
all
your
life
without
any
knowledge
whatever
of
the
at
any
rate
have
sense
enough
to
listen
to
me
she
went
on
silencing
her
husband
who
was
about
to
speak
you
think
the
matter
is
done
for
she
asked
camusot
looked
at
his
wife
as
a
country
bumpkin
looks
at
a
conjurer
if
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
and
madame
de
serizy
are
compromised
you
will
find
them
both
ready
to
patronize
you
said
amelie
madame
de
serizy
will
get
you
admission
to
the
keeper
of
the
seals
and
you
will
tell
him
the
secret
history
of
the
affair
then
he
will
amuse
the
king
with
the
story
for
sovereigns
always
wish
to
see
the
wrong
side
of
the
tapestry
and
to
know
the
real
meaning
of
the
events
the
public
stare
at
henceforth
there
will
be
no
cause
to
fear
either
the
public
prosecutor
or
monsieur
de
what
a
treasure
such
a
wife
is
cried
the
lawyer
plucking
up
courage
after
all
i
have
unearthed
jacques
collin
i
shall
send
him
to
his
account
at
the
assize
court
and
unmask
his
crimes
such
a
trial
is
a
triumph
in
the
career
of
an
examining
judge
camusot
amelie
began
pleased
to
see
her
husband
rally
from
the
moral
and
physical
prostration
into
which
he
had
been
thrown
by
lucien
s
suicide
the
president
told
you
that
you
had
blundered
to
the
wrong
side
now
you
are
blundering
as
much
to
the
other
you
are
losing
your
way
again
my
the
magistrate
stood
up
looking
at
his
wife
with
a
stupid
stare
the
king
and
the
keeper
of
the
seals
will
be
glad
no
doubt
to
know
the
truth
of
this
business
and
at
the
same
time
much
annoyed
at
seeing
the
lawyers
on
the
liberal
side
dragging
important
persons
to
the
bar
of
opinion
and
of
the
assize
court
by
their
special
pleading
such
people
as
the
maufrigneuses
the
serizys
and
the
grandlieus
in
short
all
who
are
directly
or
indirectly
mixed
up
with
this
they
are
all
in
it
i
have
them
all
cried
camusot
and
camusot
walked
up
and
down
the
room
like
sganarelle
on
the
stage
when
he
is
trying
to
get
out
of
a
scrape
listen
amelie
said
he
standing
in
front
of
his
wife
an
incident
recurs
to
my
mind
a
trifle
in
itself
but
in
my
position
of
vital
importance
realize
my
dear
that
this
jacques
collin
is
a
giant
of
cunning
of
dissimulation
of
he
is
what
shall
i
say
the
cromwell
of
the
hulks
i
never
met
such
a
scoundrel
he
almost
took
me
but
in
examining
a
criminal
a
little
end
of
thread
leads
you
to
find
a
ball
is
a
clue
to
the
investigation
of
the
darkest
consciences
and
obscurest
when
jacques
collin
saw
me
turning
over
the
letters
seized
in
lucien
de
rubempre
s
lodgings
the
villain
glanced
at
them
with
the
evident
intention
of
seeing
whether
some
particular
packet
were
among
them
and
he
allowed
himself
to
give
a
visible
expression
of
satisfaction
this
look
as
of
a
thief
valuing
his
booty
this
movement
as
of
a
man
in
danger
saying
to
himself
my
weapons
are
safe
betrayed
a
world
of
things
only
you
women
besides
us
and
our
examinees
can
in
a
single
flash
epitomize
a
whole
scene
revealing
trickery
as
complicated
as
volumes
of
suspicion
may
thus
be
communicated
in
a
second
it
is
terrifying
life
or
death
lies
in
a
wink
said
i
to
myself
the
rascal
has
more
letters
in
his
hands
than
these
then
the
other
details
of
the
case
filled
my
mind
i
overlooked
the
incident
for
i
thought
i
should
have
my
men
face
to
face
and
clear
up
this
point
afterwards
but
it
may
be
considered
as
quite
certain
that
jacques
collin
after
the
fashion
of
such
wretches
has
hidden
in
some
safe
place
the
most
compromising
of
the
young
fellow
s
letters
adored
as
he
was
by
and
yet
you
are
afraid
camusot
why
you
will
be
president
of
the
supreme
court
much
sooner
than
i
expected
cried
madame
camusot
her
face
beaming
now
then
you
must
proceed
so
as
to
give
satisfaction
to
everybody
for
the
matter
is
looking
so
serious
that
it
might
quite
possibly
be
snatched
from
did
they
not
take
the
proceedings
out
of
popinot
s
hands
to
place
them
in
yours
when
madame
d
espard
tried
to
get
a
commission
in
lunacy
to
incapacitate
her
husband
she
added
in
reply
to
her
husband
s
gesture
of
astonishment
well
then
might
not
the
public
prosecutor
who
takes
such
keen
interest
in
the
honor
of
monsieur
and
madame
de
serizy
carry
the
case
to
the
upper
court
and
get
a
councillor
in
his
interest
to
open
a
fresh
inquiry
bless
me
my
dear
where
did
you
study
criminal
law
cried
camusot
you
know
everything
you
can
give
me
why
do
you
believe
that
by
morning
monsieur
de
granville
will
not
have
taken
fright
at
the
possible
line
of
defence
that
might
be
adopted
by
some
liberal
advocate
whom
jacques
collin
would
manage
to
secure
for
lawyers
will
be
ready
to
pay
him
to
place
the
case
in
their
hands
and
those
ladies
know
their
danger
quite
as
well
as
you
do
not
to
say
better
they
will
put
themselves
under
the
protection
of
the
public
prosecutor
who
already
sees
their
families
unpleasantly
close
to
the
prisoner
s
bench
as
a
consequence
of
the
coalition
between
this
convict
and
lucien
de
rubempre
betrothed
to
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
lucien
esther
s
lover
madame
de
maufrigneuse
s
former
lover
madame
de
serizy
s
darling
so
you
must
conduct
the
affair
in
such
a
way
as
to
conciliate
the
favor
of
your
public
prosecutor
the
gratitude
of
monsieur
de
serizy
and
that
of
the
marquise
d
espard
and
the
comtesse
du
chatelet
to
reinforce
madame
de
maufrigneuse
s
influence
by
that
of
the
grandlieus
and
to
gain
the
complimentary
approval
of
your
president
i
will
undertake
to
deal
with
the
ladies
d
espard
de
maufrigneuse
and
de
grandlieu
you
must
go
morning
to
see
the
public
prosecutor
monsieur
de
granville
is
a
man
who
does
not
live
with
his
wife
for
ten
years
he
had
for
his
mistress
a
mademoiselle
de
bellefeuille
who
bore
him
illegitimate
children
didn
t
she
well
such
a
magistrate
is
no
saint
he
is
a
man
like
any
other
he
can
be
won
over
he
must
give
a
hold
somewhere
you
must
discover
the
weak
spot
and
flatter
him
ask
his
advice
point
out
the
dangers
of
attending
the
case
in
short
try
to
get
him
into
the
same
boat
and
you
will
be
i
ought
to
kiss
your
footprints
exclaimed
camusot
interrupting
his
wife
putting
his
arm
round
her
and
pressing
her
to
his
heart
amelie
you
have
saved
me
i
brought
you
in
tow
from
alencon
to
mantes
and
from
mantes
to
the
metropolitan
court
replied
amelie
well
well
be
quite
easy
i
intend
to
be
called
madame
la
presidente
within
five
years
time
but
my
dear
pray
always
think
over
everything
a
long
time
before
you
come
to
any
determination
a
judge
s
business
is
not
that
of
a
fireman
your
papers
are
never
in
a
blaze
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
think
so
in
your
place
blunders
are
the
whole
strength
of
my
position
lies
in
identifying
the
sham
spanish
priest
with
jacques
collin
the
judge
said
after
a
long
pause
when
once
that
identity
is
established
even
if
the
bench
should
take
the
credit
of
the
whole
affair
that
will
still
be
an
ascertained
fact
which
no
magistrate
judge
or
councillor
can
get
rid
of
i
shall
do
like
the
boys
who
tie
a
tin
kettle
to
a
cat
s
tail
the
inquiry
whoever
carries
it
on
will
make
jacques
collin
s
tin
kettle
bravo
said
amelie
and
the
public
prosecutor
would
rather
come
to
an
understanding
with
me
than
with
any
one
else
since
i
am
the
only
man
who
can
remove
the
damocles
sword
that
hangs
over
the
heart
of
the
faubourg
only
you
have
no
idea
how
hard
it
will
be
to
achieve
that
magnificent
result
just
now
when
i
was
with
monsieur
de
granville
in
his
private
office
we
agreed
he
and
i
to
take
jacques
collin
at
his
own
valuation
a
canon
of
the
chapter
of
toledo
carlos
herrera
we
consented
to
recognize
his
position
as
a
diplomatic
envoy
and
allow
him
to
be
claimed
by
the
spanish
embassy
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
plan
that
i
made
out
the
papers
by
which
lucien
de
rubempre
was
released
and
revised
the
minutes
of
the
examinations
washing
the
prisoners
as
white
as
snow
rastignac
bianchon
and
some
others
are
to
be
confronted
with
the
canon
of
toledo
they
will
not
recognize
him
as
jacques
collin
who
was
arrested
in
their
presence
ten
years
ago
in
a
cheap
where
they
knew
him
under
the
name
of
there
was
a
short
silence
while
madame
camusot
sat
thinking
are
you
sure
your
man
is
jacques
collin
she
asked
positive
said
the
lawyer
and
so
is
the
public
well
then
try
to
make
some
exposure
at
the
palais
de
justice
without
showing
your
claws
too
much
under
your
furred
cat
s
paws
if
your
man
is
still
in
the
secret
cells
go
straight
to
the
governor
of
the
conciergerie
and
contrive
to
have
the
convict
publicly
identified
instead
of
behaving
like
a
child
act
like
the
ministers
of
police
under
despotic
governments
who
invent
conspiracies
against
the
monarch
to
have
the
credit
of
discovering
them
and
making
themselves
indispensable
put
three
families
in
danger
to
have
the
glory
of
rescuing
that
luckily
reminds
me
cried
camusot
my
brain
is
so
bewildered
that
i
had
quite
forgotten
an
important
point
the
instructions
to
place
jacques
collin
in
a
private
room
were
taken
by
coquart
to
monsieur
gault
the
governor
of
the
prison
now
jacques
collin
s
great
enemy
has
taken
steps
to
have
three
criminals
who
know
the
man
transferred
from
la
force
to
the
conciergerie
if
he
appears
in
the
a
terrific
scene
is
expected
why
jacques
collin
my
dear
was
treasurer
of
the
money
owned
by
the
prisoners
in
the
hulks
amounting
to
considerable
sums
now
he
is
supposed
to
have
spent
it
all
to
maintain
the
deceased
lucien
in
luxury
and
he
will
be
called
to
account
there
will
be
such
a
battle
tells
me
as
will
require
the
intervention
of
the
warders
and
the
secret
will
be
out
jacques
collin
s
life
is
in
danger
now
if
i
get
to
the
palais
early
enough
i
may
record
the
evidence
of
oh
if
only
his
creditors
should
take
him
off
your
hands
you
would
be
thought
such
a
clever
fellow
do
not
go
to
monsieur
de
granville
s
room
wait
for
him
in
his
court
with
that
formidable
great
gun
it
is
a
loaded
cannon
turned
on
the
three
most
important
families
of
the
court
and
peerage
be
bold
propose
to
monsieur
de
granville
that
he
should
relieve
you
of
jacques
collin
by
transferring
him
to
la
force
where
the
convicts
know
how
to
deal
with
those
who
betray
them
i
will
go
to
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
who
will
take
me
to
the
grandlieus
possibly
i
may
see
monsieur
de
serizy
trust
me
to
sound
the
alarm
everywhere
above
all
send
me
a
word
we
will
agree
upon
to
let
me
know
if
the
spanish
priest
is
officially
recognized
as
jacques
collin
get
your
business
at
the
palais
over
by
two
o
clock
and
i
will
have
arranged
for
you
to
have
an
interview
with
the
keeper
of
the
seals
perhaps
i
may
find
him
with
the
marquise
d
camusot
stood
squarely
with
a
look
of
admiration
that
made
his
knowing
wife
smile
now
come
to
dinner
and
be
cheerful
said
she
in
conclusion
why
you
see
we
have
been
only
two
years
in
paris
and
here
you
are
on
the
highroad
to
be
made
councillor
before
the
end
of
the
year
from
that
to
the
presidency
of
a
court
my
dear
there
is
no
gulf
but
what
some
political
service
may
this
conjugal
sitting
shows
how
greatly
the
deeds
and
the
lightest
words
of
jacques
collin
the
lowest
personage
in
this
drama
involved
the
honor
of
the
families
among
whom
he
had
planted
his
now
dead
protege
at
the
conciergerie
lucien
s
death
and
madame
de
serizy
s
incursion
had
produced
such
a
block
in
the
wheels
of
the
machinery
that
the
governor
had
forgotten
to
remove
the
sham
priest
from
his
though
more
than
one
instance
is
on
record
of
the
death
of
a
prisoner
during
his
preliminary
examination
it
was
a
sufficiently
rare
event
to
disturb
the
warders
the
clerk
and
the
governor
and
hinder
their
working
with
their
usual
serenity
at
the
same
time
to
them
the
important
fact
was
not
the
handsome
young
fellow
so
suddenly
become
a
corpse
but
the
breakage
of
the
bar
of
the
outer
prison
gate
by
the
frail
hands
of
a
fine
lady
and
indeed
as
soon
as
the
public
prosecutor
and
comte
octave
de
bauvan
had
gone
off
with
monsieur
de
serizy
and
his
unconscious
wife
the
governor
clerk
and
turnkeys
gathered
round
the
gate
after
letting
out
monsieur
lebrun
the
prison
doctor
who
had
been
called
in
to
certify
to
lucien
s
death
in
concert
with
the
death
doctor
of
the
district
in
which
the
unfortunate
youth
had
been
lodging
in
paris
the
death
doctor
is
the
medical
officer
whose
duty
it
is
in
each
district
to
register
deaths
and
certify
to
their
causes
with
the
rapid
insight
for
which
he
was
known
monsieur
de
granville
had
judged
it
necessary
for
the
honor
of
the
families
concerned
to
have
the
certificate
of
lucien
s
death
deposited
at
the
mairie
of
the
district
in
which
the
quai
malaquais
lies
as
the
deceased
had
resided
there
and
to
have
the
body
carried
from
his
lodgings
to
the
church
of
des
pres
where
the
service
was
to
be
held
monsieur
de
chargeboeuf
monsieur
de
granville
s
private
secretary
had
orders
to
this
effect
the
body
was
to
be
transferred
from
the
prison
during
the
night
the
secretary
was
desired
to
go
at
once
and
settle
matters
at
the
mairie
with
the
parish
authorities
and
with
the
official
undertakers
thus
to
the
world
in
general
lucien
would
have
died
at
liberty
in
his
own
lodgings
the
funeral
would
start
from
thence
and
his
friends
would
be
invited
there
for
the
ceremony
so
when
camusot
his
mind
at
ease
was
sitting
down
to
dinner
with
his
ambitious
the
governor
of
the
conciergerie
and
monsieur
lebrun
the
prison
doctor
were
standing
outside
the
gate
bewailing
the
fragility
of
iron
bars
and
the
strength
of
ladies
in
love
no
one
knows
said
the
doctor
to
monsieur
gault
what
an
amount
of
nervous
force
there
is
in
a
man
wound
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
passion
dynamics
and
mathematics
have
no
formulas
or
symbols
to
express
that
power
why
only
yesterday
i
witnessed
an
experiment
which
gave
me
a
shudder
and
which
accounts
for
the
terrible
strength
put
forth
just
now
by
that
little
tell
me
about
it
said
monsieur
gault
for
i
am
so
foolish
as
to
take
an
interest
in
magnetism
i
do
not
believe
in
it
but
it
mystifies
a
physician
who
magnetizes
for
there
are
men
among
us
who
believe
in
magnetism
lebrun
went
on
offered
to
experiment
on
me
in
proof
of
a
phenomenon
that
he
described
and
i
doubted
curious
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
one
of
the
strange
states
of
nervous
tension
by
which
the
existence
of
magnetism
is
demonstrated
i
consented
these
are
the
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
what
our
college
of
medicine
would
say
if
each
of
its
members
in
turn
were
subjected
to
this
influence
which
leaves
no
loophole
for
incredulity
my
old
friend
this
doctor
said
doctor
lebrun
parenthetically
is
an
old
man
persecuted
for
his
opinions
since
mesmer
s
time
by
all
the
faculty
he
is
seventy
or
years
of
age
and
his
name
is
bouvard
at
the
present
day
he
is
the
patriarchal
representative
of
the
theory
of
animal
magnetism
this
good
man
regards
me
as
a
son
i
owe
my
training
to
well
this
worthy
old
bouvard
it
was
who
proposed
to
prove
to
me
that
put
in
motion
by
the
magnetizer
was
not
indeed
infinite
for
man
is
under
immutable
laws
but
a
power
acting
like
other
powers
of
nature
whose
elemental
essence
escapes
our
observation
for
instance
said
he
if
you
place
your
hand
in
that
of
a
somnambulist
who
when
awake
can
press
it
only
up
to
a
certain
average
of
tightness
you
will
see
that
in
the
somnambulistic
state
as
it
is
stupidly
termed
his
fingers
can
clutch
like
a
vise
screwed
up
by
a
well
monsieur
i
placed
my
hand
in
that
of
a
woman
not
asleep
for
bouvard
rejects
the
word
but
isolated
and
when
the
old
man
bid
her
squeeze
my
wrist
as
long
and
as
tightly
as
she
could
i
begged
him
to
stop
when
the
blood
was
almost
bursting
from
my
finger
tips
look
you
can
see
the
marks
of
her
clutch
which
i
shall
not
lose
for
these
three
the
deuce
exclaimed
monsieur
gault
as
he
saw
a
band
of
bruised
flesh
looking
like
the
scar
of
a
burn
my
dear
gault
the
doctor
went
on
if
my
wrist
had
been
gripped
in
an
iron
manacle
screwed
tight
by
a
locksmith
i
should
not
have
felt
the
bracelet
of
metal
so
hard
as
that
woman
s
fingers
her
hand
was
of
unyielding
steel
and
i
am
convinced
that
she
could
have
crushed
my
bones
and
broken
my
hand
from
the
wrist
the
pressure
beginning
almost
insensibly
increased
without
relaxing
fresh
force
being
constantly
added
to
the
former
grip
a
tourniquet
could
not
have
been
more
effectual
than
that
hand
used
as
an
instrument
of
to
me
therefore
it
seems
proven
that
under
the
influence
of
passion
which
is
the
will
concentrated
on
one
point
and
raised
to
an
incalculable
power
of
animal
force
as
the
different
varieties
of
electric
force
are
also
man
may
direct
his
whole
vitality
whether
for
attack
or
resistance
to
one
of
his
now
this
little
lady
under
the
stress
of
her
despair
had
concentrated
her
vital
force
in
her
she
must
have
a
good
deal
too
to
break
a
bar
said
the
chief
warder
with
a
shake
of
the
head
there
was
a
flaw
in
it
monsieur
gault
observed
for
my
part
said
the
doctor
i
dare
assign
no
limits
to
nervous
force
and
indeed
it
is
by
this
that
mothers
to
save
their
children
can
magnetize
lions
climb
in
a
fire
along
a
parapet
where
a
cat
would
not
venture
and
endure
the
torments
that
sometimes
attend
childbirth
in
this
lies
the
secret
of
the
attempts
made
by
convicts
and
prisoners
to
regain
their
liberty
the
extent
of
our
vital
energies
is
as
yet
unknown
they
are
part
of
the
energy
of
nature
itself
and
we
draw
them
from
unknown
monsieur
said
the
warder
in
an
undertone
to
the
governor
coming
close
to
him
as
he
was
escorting
doctor
lebrun
as
far
as
the
outer
gates
of
the
conciergerie
number
in
the
secret
cells
says
he
is
ill
and
needs
the
doctor
he
declares
he
is
dying
added
the
turnkey
indeed
said
the
governor
his
breath
rattles
in
his
throat
replied
the
man
it
is
five
o
clock
said
the
doctor
i
have
had
no
dinner
but
after
all
i
am
at
hand
come
let
us
number
as
it
happens
is
the
spanish
priest
suspected
of
being
jacques
collin
said
monsieur
gault
to
the
doctor
and
one
of
the
persons
suspected
of
the
crime
in
which
that
poor
young
man
was
i
saw
him
this
morning
replied
the
doctor
monsieur
camusot
sent
for
me
to
give
evidence
as
to
the
state
of
the
rascal
s
health
and
i
may
assure
you
that
he
is
perfectly
well
and
could
make
a
fortune
by
playing
the
part
of
hercules
in
a
troupe
of
perhaps
he
wants
to
kill
himself
too
said
monsieur
gault
let
us
both
go
down
to
the
cells
together
for
i
ought
to
go
there
if
only
to
transfer
him
to
an
upper
room
monsieur
camusot
has
given
orders
to
mitigate
this
anonymous
gentleman
s
jacques
collin
known
as
in
the
world
of
the
hulks
who
must
henceforth
be
called
only
by
his
real
name
had
gone
through
terrible
distress
of
mind
since
after
hearing
camusot
s
order
he
had
been
taken
back
to
the
underground
cell
an
anguish
such
as
he
had
never
before
known
in
the
course
of
a
life
diversified
by
many
crimes
by
three
escapes
and
two
sentences
at
the
assizes
and
is
there
not
something
monstrously
fine
in
the
attachment
shown
to
the
man
he
had
made
his
friend
by
this
wretch
in
whom
were
concentrated
all
the
life
the
powers
the
spirit
and
the
passions
of
the
hulks
who
was
so
to
speak
their
highest
expression
wicked
infamous
and
in
so
many
ways
horrible
this
absolute
worship
of
his
idol
makes
him
so
truly
interesting
that
this
study
long
as
it
is
already
would
seem
incomplete
and
cut
short
if
the
close
of
this
criminal
career
did
not
come
as
a
sequel
to
lucien
de
rubempre
s
end
the
little
spaniel
being
dead
we
want
to
know
whether
his
terrible
playfellow
the
lion
will
live
on
in
real
life
in
society
every
event
is
so
inevitably
linked
to
other
events
that
one
can
not
occur
without
the
rest
the
water
of
the
great
river
forms
a
sort
of
fluid
floor
not
a
wave
however
rebellious
however
high
it
may
toss
itself
but
its
powerful
crest
must
sink
to
the
level
of
the
mass
of
waters
stronger
by
the
momentum
of
its
course
than
the
revolt
of
the
surges
it
bears
with
it
and
just
as
you
watch
the
current
flow
seeing
in
it
a
confused
sheet
of
images
so
perhaps
you
would
like
to
measure
the
pressure
exerted
by
social
energy
on
the
vortex
called
vautrin
to
see
how
far
away
the
rebellious
eddy
will
be
carried
ere
it
is
lost
and
what
the
end
will
be
of
this
really
diabolical
man
human
still
by
the
power
of
loving
so
hardly
can
that
heavenly
grace
perish
even
in
the
most
cankered
heart
this
wretched
convict
embodying
the
poem
that
has
smiled
on
many
a
poet
s
fancy
on
moore
on
lord
byron
on
mathurin
on
canalis
the
demon
who
has
drawn
an
angel
down
to
hell
to
refresh
him
with
dews
stolen
from
heaven
this
jacques
collin
will
be
seen
by
the
reader
who
has
understood
that
iron
soul
to
have
sacrificed
his
own
life
for
seven
years
past
his
vast
powers
absorbed
in
lucien
acted
solely
for
lucien
he
lived
for
his
progress
his
loves
his
ambitions
to
him
lucien
was
his
own
soul
made
visible
it
was
who
dined
with
the
grandlieus
stole
into
ladies
boudoirs
and
loved
esther
by
proxy
in
fact
in
lucien
he
saw
jacques
collin
young
handsome
noble
and
rising
to
the
dignity
of
an
ambassador
had
realized
the
german
superstition
of
a
doppelganger
by
means
of
a
spiritual
paternity
a
phenomenon
which
will
be
quite
intelligible
to
those
women
who
have
ever
truly
loved
who
have
felt
their
soul
merge
in
that
of
the
man
they
adore
who
have
lived
his
life
whether
noble
or
infamous
happy
or
unhappy
obscure
or
brilliant
who
in
defiance
of
distance
have
felt
a
pain
in
their
leg
if
he
were
wounded
in
his
who
if
he
fought
a
duel
would
have
been
aware
of
it
and
who
to
put
the
matter
in
a
nutshell
did
not
need
to
be
told
he
was
unfaithful
to
know
it
as
he
went
back
to
his
cell
jacques
collin
said
to
himself
the
boy
is
being
and
he
shivered
he
who
thought
no
more
of
killing
a
man
than
a
laborer
does
of
drinking
has
he
been
able
to
see
his
mistresses
he
wondered
has
my
aunt
succeeded
in
catching
those
damned
females
have
the
duchesses
and
countesses
bestirred
themselves
and
prevented
his
being
examined
has
lucien
had
my
instructions
and
if
will
have
it
that
he
is
how
will
he
carry
it
off
poor
boy
and
i
have
brought
him
to
this
it
is
that
rascal
paccard
and
that
sneak
europe
who
have
caused
all
this
rumpus
by
collaring
the
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
for
the
certificate
nucingen
gave
esther
that
precious
pair
tripped
us
up
at
the
last
step
but
i
will
make
them
pay
dear
for
their
pranks
one
day
more
and
lucien
would
have
been
a
rich
man
he
might
have
married
his
clotilde
de
then
the
boy
would
have
been
all
my
own
and
to
think
that
our
fate
depends
on
a
look
on
a
blush
of
lucien
s
under
camusot
s
eye
who
sees
everything
and
has
all
a
judge
s
wits
about
him
for
when
he
showed
me
the
letters
we
tipped
each
other
a
wink
in
which
we
took
each
other
s
measure
and
he
guessed
that
i
can
make
lucien
s
fork
this
soliloquy
lasted
for
three
hours
his
torments
were
so
great
that
they
were
too
much
for
that
frame
of
iron
and
vitriol
jacques
collin
whose
brain
felt
on
fire
with
insanity
suffered
such
fearful
thirst
that
he
unconsciously
drank
up
all
the
water
contained
in
one
of
the
pails
with
which
the
cell
was
supplied
forming
with
the
bed
all
its
furniture
if
he
loses
his
head
what
will
become
of
him
for
the
poor
child
has
not
theodore
s
tenacity
said
he
to
himself
as
he
lay
down
on
the
like
a
bed
in
a
a
word
must
here
be
said
about
this
theodore
remembered
by
jacques
collin
at
such
a
critical
moment
theodore
calvi
a
young
corsican
imprisoned
for
life
at
the
age
of
eighteen
for
eleven
murders
thanks
to
the
influential
interference
paid
for
with
vast
sums
had
been
made
the
fellow
convict
of
jacques
collin
to
whom
he
was
chained
in
and
jacques
collin
s
last
escape
one
of
his
finest
inventions
for
he
had
got
out
disguised
as
a
gendarme
leading
theodore
calvi
as
he
was
a
convict
called
before
the
commissary
of
police
had
been
effected
in
the
seaport
of
rochefort
where
the
convicts
die
by
dozens
and
where
it
was
hoped
these
two
dangerous
rascals
would
have
ended
their
days
though
they
escaped
together
the
difficulties
of
their
flight
had
forced
them
to
separate
theodore
was
caught
and
restored
to
the
hulks
indeed
a
life
with
lucien
a
youth
innocent
of
all
crime
who
had
only
minor
sins
on
his
conscience
dawned
on
him
as
bright
and
glorious
as
a
summer
sun
while
with
theodore
jacques
collin
could
look
forward
to
no
end
but
the
scaffold
after
a
career
of
indispensable
crimes
the
thought
of
disaster
as
a
result
of
lucien
s
weakness
for
his
experience
of
an
underground
cell
would
certainly
have
turned
his
brain
took
vast
proportions
in
jacques
collin
s
mind
and
contemplating
the
probabilities
of
such
a
misfortune
the
unhappy
man
felt
his
eyes
fill
with
tears
a
phenomenon
that
had
been
utterly
unknown
to
him
since
his
earliest
childhood
i
must
be
in
a
furious
fever
said
he
to
himself
and
perhaps
if
i
send
for
the
doctor
and
offer
him
a
handsome
sum
he
will
put
me
in
communication
with
at
this
moment
the
turnkey
brought
in
his
dinner
it
is
quite
useless
my
boy
i
can
not
eat
tell
the
governor
of
this
prison
to
send
the
doctor
to
see
me
i
am
very
bad
and
i
believe
my
last
hour
has
hearing
the
guttural
rattle
that
accompanied
these
words
the
warder
bowed
and
went
jacques
collin
clung
wildly
to
this
hope
but
when
he
saw
the
doctor
and
the
governor
come
in
together
he
perceived
that
the
attempt
was
abortive
and
coolly
awaited
the
upshot
of
the
visit
holding
out
his
wrist
for
the
doctor
to
feel
his
pulse
the
abbe
is
feverish
said
the
doctor
to
monsieur
gault
but
it
is
the
type
of
fever
we
always
find
in
inculpated
prisoners
and
to
me
he
added
in
the
governor
s
ear
it
is
always
a
sign
of
some
degree
of
just
then
the
governor
to
whom
the
public
prosecutor
had
intrusted
lucien
s
letter
to
be
given
to
jacques
collin
left
the
doctor
and
the
prisoner
together
under
the
guard
of
the
warder
and
went
to
fetch
the
letter
monsieur
said
jacques
collin
seeing
the
warder
outside
the
door
and
not
understanding
why
the
governor
had
left
them
i
should
think
nothing
of
thirty
thousand
francs
if
i
might
send
five
lines
to
lucien
de
i
will
not
rob
you
of
your
money
said
doctor
lebrun
no
one
in
this
world
can
ever
communicate
with
him
again
no
one
said
the
prisoner
in
amazement
why
he
has
hanged
himself
no
tigress
robbed
of
her
whelps
ever
startled
an
indian
jungle
with
a
yell
so
fearful
as
that
of
jacques
collin
who
rose
to
his
feet
as
a
tiger
rears
to
spring
and
fired
a
glance
at
the
doctor
as
scorching
as
the
flash
of
a
falling
thunderbolt
then
he
fell
back
on
the
bed
exclaiming
oh
my
son
poor
man
said
the
doctor
moved
by
this
terrific
convulsion
of
nature
in
fact
the
first
explosion
gave
way
to
such
utter
collapse
that
the
words
oh
my
son
were
but
a
murmur
is
this
one
going
to
die
in
our
hands
too
said
the
turnkey
no
it
is
impossible
jacques
collin
went
on
raising
himself
and
looking
at
the
two
witnesses
of
the
scene
with
a
dead
cold
eye
you
are
mistaken
it
is
not
lucien
you
did
not
see
a
man
can
not
hang
himself
in
one
of
these
cells
look
how
could
i
hang
myself
here
all
paris
shall
answer
to
me
for
that
boy
s
life
god
owes
it
to
the
warder
and
the
doctor
were
amazed
in
their
turn
they
whom
nothing
had
astonished
for
many
a
long
day
on
seeing
the
governor
jacques
collin
crushed
by
the
very
violence
of
this
outburst
of
grief
seemed
somewhat
calmer
here
is
a
letter
which
the
public
prosecutor
placed
in
my
hands
for
you
with
permission
to
give
it
to
you
sealed
said
monsieur
gault
from
lucien
said
jacques
collin
yes
is
not
that
young
man
he
is
dead
said
the
governor
even
if
the
doctor
had
been
on
the
spot
he
would
unfortunately
have
been
too
late
the
young
man
died
there
in
one
of
the
rooms
may
i
see
him
with
my
own
eyes
asked
jacques
collin
timidly
will
you
allow
a
father
to
weep
over
the
body
of
his
son
you
can
if
you
like
take
his
room
for
i
have
orders
to
remove
you
from
these
cells
you
are
no
longer
in
such
close
confinement
the
prisoner
s
eyes
from
which
all
light
and
warmth
had
fled
turned
slowly
from
the
governor
to
the
doctor
jacques
collin
was
examining
them
fearing
some
trap
and
he
was
afraid
to
go
out
of
the
cell
if
you
wish
to
see
the
body
said
lebrun
you
have
no
time
to
lose
it
is
to
be
carried
away
if
you
have
children
gentlemen
said
jacques
collin
you
will
understand
my
state
of
mind
i
hardly
know
what
i
am
doing
this
blow
is
worse
to
me
than
death
but
you
can
not
know
what
i
am
saying
even
if
you
are
fathers
it
is
only
after
a
fashion
i
am
a
mother
too
i
i
am
going
mad
i
feel
it
by
going
through
certain
passages
which
open
only
to
the
governor
it
is
possible
to
get
very
quickly
from
the
cells
to
the
private
rooms
the
two
sets
of
rooms
are
divided
by
an
underground
corridor
formed
of
two
massive
walls
supporting
the
vault
over
which
galerie
marchande
as
it
is
called
is
built
so
jacques
collin
escorted
by
the
warder
who
took
his
arm
preceded
by
the
governor
and
followed
by
the
doctor
in
a
few
minutes
reached
the
cell
where
lucien
was
lying
stretched
on
the
bed
on
seeing
the
body
he
threw
himself
upon
it
seizing
it
in
a
desperate
embrace
with
a
passion
and
impulse
that
made
these
spectators
shudder
there
said
the
doctor
to
monsieur
gault
that
is
an
instance
of
what
i
was
telling
you
you
see
that
man
clutching
the
body
and
you
do
not
know
what
a
corpse
is
it
is
stone
leave
me
alone
said
jacques
collin
in
a
smothered
voice
i
have
not
long
to
look
at
him
they
will
take
him
away
to
he
paused
at
the
word
bury
you
will
allow
me
to
have
some
relic
of
my
dear
boy
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
cut
off
a
lock
of
his
hair
for
me
monsieur
he
said
to
the
doctor
for
i
can
not
he
was
certainly
his
son
said
lebrun
do
you
think
so
replied
the
governor
in
a
meaning
tone
which
made
the
doctor
thoughtful
for
a
few
minutes
the
governor
gave
orders
that
the
prisoner
should
be
left
in
this
cell
and
that
some
locks
of
hair
should
be
cut
for
the
father
before
the
body
should
be
removed
at
five
in
the
month
of
may
it
is
easy
to
read
a
letter
in
the
conciergerie
in
spite
of
the
iron
bars
and
the
close
wire
trellis
that
guard
the
windows
so
jacques
collin
read
the
dreadful
letter
while
he
still
held
lucien
s
hand
the
man
is
not
known
who
can
hold
a
lump
of
ice
for
ten
minutes
tightly
clutched
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
the
cold
penetrates
to
the
very
with
mortal
rapidity
but
the
effect
of
that
cruel
chill
acting
like
a
poison
is
as
nothing
to
that
which
strikes
to
the
soul
from
the
cold
rigid
hand
of
the
dead
thus
held
thus
death
speaks
to
life
it
tells
many
dark
secrets
which
kill
many
feelings
for
in
matters
of
feeling
is
not
change
death
as
we
read
through
once
more
with
jacques
collin
lucien
s
last
letter
it
will
strike
us
as
being
what
it
was
to
this
man
a
cup
of
poison
the
abbe
carlos
my
dear
abbe
i
have
had
only
benefits
from
you
and
i
have
betrayed
you
this
involuntary
ingratitude
is
killing
me
and
when
you
read
these
lines
i
shall
have
ceased
to
exist
you
are
not
here
now
to
save
me
you
had
given
me
full
liberty
if
i
should
find
it
advantageous
to
destroy
you
by
flinging
you
on
the
ground
like
a
but
i
have
ruined
you
by
a
blunder
to
escape
from
a
difficulty
deluded
by
a
clever
question
from
the
examining
judge
your
son
by
adoption
and
grace
went
over
to
the
side
of
those
who
aim
at
killing
you
at
any
cost
and
insist
on
proving
an
identity
which
i
know
to
be
impossible
between
you
and
a
french
villain
all
is
said
between
a
man
of
your
calibre
and
me
me
of
whom
you
tried
to
make
a
greater
man
than
i
am
capable
of
being
no
foolish
sentiment
can
come
at
the
moment
of
final
parting
you
hoped
to
make
me
powerful
and
famous
and
you
have
thrown
me
into
the
gulf
of
suicide
that
is
all
i
have
long
heard
the
broad
pinions
of
that
vertigo
beating
over
my
head
as
you
have
sometimes
said
there
is
the
posterity
of
cain
and
the
posterity
of
abel
in
the
great
human
drama
cain
is
in
opposition
you
are
descended
from
adam
through
that
line
in
which
the
devil
still
fans
the
fire
of
which
the
first
spark
was
flung
on
eve
among
the
demons
of
that
pedigree
from
time
to
time
we
see
one
of
stupendous
power
summing
up
every
form
of
human
energy
and
resembling
the
fevered
beasts
of
the
desert
whose
vitality
demands
the
vast
spaces
they
find
there
such
men
are
as
dangerous
as
lions
would
be
in
the
heart
of
normandy
they
must
have
their
prey
and
they
devour
common
men
and
crop
the
money
of
fools
their
sport
is
so
dangerous
that
at
last
they
kill
the
humble
dog
whom
they
have
taken
for
a
companion
and
made
an
idol
of
when
it
is
god
s
will
these
mysterious
beings
may
be
a
moses
an
attila
charlemagne
mahomet
or
napoleon
but
when
he
leaves
a
generation
of
these
stupendous
tools
to
rust
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
they
are
no
more
than
a
pugatschef
a
fouche
a
louvel
or
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
gifted
with
immense
power
over
tenderer
souls
they
entrap
them
and
mangle
them
it
is
grand
it
is
fine
in
its
way
it
is
the
poisonous
plant
with
gorgeous
coloring
that
fascinates
children
in
the
woods
it
is
the
poetry
of
evil
men
like
you
ought
to
dwell
in
caves
and
never
come
out
of
them
you
have
made
me
live
that
vast
life
and
i
have
had
all
my
share
of
existence
so
i
may
very
well
take
my
head
out
of
the
gordian
knot
of
your
policy
and
slip
it
into
the
running
knot
of
my
cravat
to
repair
the
mischief
i
have
done
i
am
forwarding
to
the
public
prosecutor
a
retraction
of
my
deposition
you
will
know
how
to
take
advantage
of
this
document
in
virtue
of
a
will
formally
drawn
up
restitution
will
be
made
monsieur
l
abbe
of
the
moneys
belonging
to
your
order
which
you
so
imprudently
devoted
to
my
use
as
a
result
of
your
paternal
affection
for
me
and
so
farewell
farewell
colossal
image
of
evil
and
corruption
farewell
to
you
who
if
started
on
the
right
road
might
have
been
greater
than
ximenes
greater
than
richelieu
you
have
kept
your
promises
i
find
myself
once
more
just
as
i
was
on
the
banks
of
the
charente
after
enjoying
by
your
help
the
enchantments
of
a
dream
but
unfortunately
it
is
not
now
in
the
waters
of
my
native
place
that
i
shall
drown
the
errors
of
a
boy
but
in
the
seine
and
my
hole
is
a
cell
in
the
conciergerie
do
not
regret
me
my
contempt
for
you
is
as
great
as
my
admiration
a
little
before
one
in
the
morning
when
the
men
came
to
fetch
away
the
body
they
found
jacques
collin
kneeling
by
the
bed
the
letter
on
the
floor
dropped
no
doubt
as
a
suicide
drops
the
pistol
that
has
shot
him
but
the
unhappy
man
still
held
lucien
s
hand
between
his
own
and
was
praying
to
god
on
seeing
this
man
the
porters
paused
for
a
moment
for
he
looked
like
one
of
those
stone
images
kneeling
to
all
eternity
on
a
mediaeval
tomb
the
work
of
some
s
genius
the
sham
priest
with
eyes
as
bright
as
a
tiger
s
but
stiffened
into
supernatural
rigidity
so
impressed
the
men
that
they
gently
bid
him
rise
why
he
asked
mildly
the
audacious
was
as
meek
as
a
child
the
governor
pointed
him
out
to
monsieur
de
chargeboeuf
and
he
respecting
such
grief
and
believing
that
jacques
collin
was
indeed
the
priest
he
called
himself
explained
the
orders
given
by
monsieur
de
granville
with
regard
to
the
funeral
service
and
arrangements
showing
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
the
body
should
be
transferred
to
lucien
s
lodgings
quai
malaquais
where
the
priests
were
waiting
to
watch
by
it
for
the
rest
of
the
night
it
is
worthy
of
that
gentleman
s
magnanimity
said
jacques
collin
sadly
tell
him
monsieur
that
he
may
rely
on
my
gratitude
yes
i
am
in
a
position
to
do
him
great
service
do
not
forget
these
words
they
are
of
the
utmost
importance
to
him
oh
monsieur
strange
changes
come
over
a
man
s
spirit
when
for
seven
hours
he
has
wept
over
such
a
son
as
he
and
i
shall
see
him
no
more
after
gazing
once
more
at
lucien
with
an
expression
of
a
mother
bereft
of
her
child
s
remains
jacques
collin
sank
in
a
heap
as
he
saw
lucien
s
body
carried
away
he
uttered
a
groan
that
made
the
men
hurry
off
the
public
prosecutor
s
private
secretary
and
the
governor
of
the
prison
had
already
made
their
escape
from
the
scene
what
had
become
of
that
iron
spirit
of
the
decision
which
was
a
match
in
swiftness
for
the
eye
of
the
nature
in
which
thought
and
action
flashed
forth
together
like
one
flame
of
the
sinews
hardened
by
three
spells
of
labor
on
the
hulks
and
by
three

hammering

its

may
become
disintegrated
and
without

the

had
lost
its

blacksmiths
locksmiths
sometimes
express
this
state
by
saying

exclusively
to

all

not

metal
that

priests
and

often
find
great

in

awful

of

break
and
strange
to
say
always
at
the
moment
when
these
confessions
are
useless
when
this
weakness
as
of
death
snatches
from
the
man
the
mask
of
innocence
which
made
justice
uneasy
for
it
always
is
uneasy
when
the
criminal
dies
without

napoleon
went
through
this
collapse
of
every
human
power
on
the
field
of
waterloo
at
eight
in
the
morning
when
the
warder
of
the
better
cells
entered
the
room
where
jacques
collin
was
confined
he
found
him
pale
and
calm
like
a
man
who
has
collected
all
his
strength
by
sheer
determination
it
is
the
hour
for
airing
in
the
said
the
turnkey
you
have
not
been
out
for
three
days
if
you
choose
to
take
air
and
exercise
you
jacques
collin
lost
in
his
absorbing
thoughts
and
taking
no
interest
in
himself
regarding
himself
as
a
garment
with
no
body
in
it
a
perfect
rag
never
suspected
the
trap
laid
for
him
by
nor
the
importance
attaching
to
his
walk
in
the
the
unhappy
man
went
out
mechanically
along
the
corridor
by
the
cells
built
into
the
magnificent
cloisters
of
the
palace
of
the
kings
over
which
is
the
corridor
as
it
is
called
leading
to
the
various
purlieus
of
the
court
of
appeals
this
passage
joins
that
of
the
better
cells
and
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
cell
in
which
louvel
was
imprisoned
one
of
the
most
famous
of
the
regicides
is
the
room
at
the
right
angle
formed
by
the
junction
of
the
two
corridors
under
the
pretty
room
in
the
tour
bonbec
there
is
a
spiral
staircase
leading
from
the
dark
passage
and
serving
the
prisoners
who
are
lodged
in
these
cells
to
go
up
and
down
on
their
way
from
or
to
the
yard
every
prisoner
whether
committed
for
trial
or
already
sentenced
and
the
prisoners
under
suspicion
who
have
been
reprieved
from
the
closest
cells
in
short
every
one
in
confinement
in
the
conciergerie
takes
exercise
in
this
narrow
paved
courtyard
for
some
hours
every
day
especially
the
early
hours
of
summer
mornings
this
recreation
ground
the

the
scaffold
or
the
hulks
on
one
side
on
the
other
still
clings
to
the
world
through
the
gendarme
the
examining
judge
and
the
assize
court
it
strikes
a
greater
chill
perhaps
than
even
the
scaffold
the
scaffold
may
be
a
pedestal
to
soar
to
heaven
from
but
the
is
every
infamy
on
earth
concentrated
and
unavoidable
whether
at
la
force
or
at
poissy
at

or
at

a
the
same
details
are
exactly
repeated
all
but
the
color
of
the
walls
their
height
and
the
space
enclosed
so
this
study
of
manners
would
be
false
to
its
name
if
it
did
not
include
an
exact
description
of
this
pandemonium
of
paris
under
the
mighty
vaulting
which
supports
the
lower
courts
and
the
court
of
appeals
there
is
close
to
the
fourth
arch
a
stone
slab
used
by
it
is
said
for
the
distribution
of
alms
and
doing
duty
in
our
day
as
a
counter
for
the
sale
of
eatables
to
the
prisoners
so
as
soon
as
the
is
open
to
the
prisoners
they
gather
round
this
stone
table
which
displays
such
dainties
as
desire
brandy
rum
and
the
like
the
first
two
archways
on
that
side
of
the
yard
facing
the
fine
byzantine
corridor
the
only
vestige
now
of
elegant
palace
form
a
parlor
where
the
prisoners
and
their
counsel
may
meet
to
which
the
prisoners
have
access
through
a
formidable
gateway
a
double
passage
railed
off
by
enormous
bars
within
the
width
of
the
third
archway
this
double
way
is
like
the
temporary
passages
arranged
at
the
door
of
a
theatre
to
keep
a
line
on
occasions
when
a
great
success
brings
a
crowd
this
parlor
at
the
very
end
of
the
vast
of
the
conciergerie
and
lighted
by
on
the
yard
side
has
lately
been
opened
out
towards
the
back
and
the
opening
filled
with
glass
so
that
the
interviews
of
the
lawyers
with
their
clients
are
under
supervision
this
innovation
was
made
necessary
by
the
too
great
fascinations
brought
to
bear
by
pretty
women
on
their
counsel
where
will
morality
stop
short
such
precautions
are
like
the
sets
of
questions
for
where
pure
imaginations
are
defiled
by
meditating
on
unknown
and
monstrous
depravity
in
this
parlor
too
parents
and
friends
may
be
allowed
by
the
authorities
to
meet
the
prisoners
whether
on
remand
or
awaiting
their
sentence
the
reader
may
now
understand
what
the
is
to
the
two
hundred
prisoners
in
the
conciergerie
their
garden
a
garden
without
trees
beds
or
flowers
in
short
a
the
parlor
and
the
stone
of
where
such
food
and
liquor
as
are
allowed
are
dispensed
are
the
only
possible
means
of
communication
with
the
outer
world
the
hour
spent
in
the
yard
is
the
only
time
when
the
prisoner
is
in
the
open
air
or
the
society
of
his
kind
in
other
prisons
those
who
are
sentenced
for
a
term
are
brought
together
in
workshops
but
in
the
conciergerie
no
occupation
is
allowed
excepting
in
the
privileged
cells
there
the
absorbing
idea
in
every
mind
is
the
drama
of
the
assize
court
since
the
culprit
comes
only
to
be
examined
or
to
be
sentenced
this
yard
is
indeed
terrible
to
behold
it
can
not
be
imagined
it
must
be
seen
in
the
first
place
the
assemblage
in
a
space
forty
metres
long
by
thirty
wide
of
a
hundred
condemned
or
suspected
criminals
does
not
constitute
the
cream
of
society
these
creatures
belonging
for
the
most
part
to
the
lowest
ranks
are
poorly
clad
their
countenances
are
base
or
horrible
for
a
criminal
from
the
upper
sphere
of
society
is
happily
a
rare
exception
peculation
forgery
or
fraudulent
bankruptcy
the
only
crimes
that
can
bring
decent
folks
so
low
enjoy
the
privilege
of
the
better
cells
and
then
the
prisoner
scarcely
ever
quits
it
this
promenade
bounded
by
fine
but
formidable
blackened
walls
by
a
cloister
divided
up
into
cells
by
fortifications
on
the
side
towards
the
quay
by
the
barred
cells
of
the
better
class
on
the
north
watched
by
vigilant
warders
and
filled
with
a
herd
of
criminals
all
meanly
suspicious
of
each
other
is
depressing
enough
in
itself
and
it
becomes
terrifying
when
you
find
yourself
the
centre
of
all
those
eyes
full
of
hatred
curiosity
and
despair
face
to
face
with
that
degraded
crew
not
a
gleam
of
gladness
all
is
gloom
the
place
and
the
men
all
is
speechless
the
walls
and
men
s
consciences
to
these
hapless
creatures
danger
lies
everywhere
excepting
in
the
case
of
an
alliance
as
ominous
as
the
prison
where
it
was
formed
they
dare
not
trust
each
other
the
police
poisons
the
atmosphere
and
taints
everything
even
the
of
two
criminals
who
have
been
intimate
a
convict
who
meets
his
most
familiar
comrade
does
not
know
that
he
may
not
have
repented
and
have
made
a
confession
to
save
his
life
this
absence
of
confidence
this
dread
of
the
nark
marks
the
liberty
already
so
illusory
of
the
the
nark
in
french
le
mouton
or
le
coqueur
is
a
spy
who
affects
to
be
sentenced
for
some
serious
offence
and
whose
skill
consists
in
pretending
to
be
a
chum
the
chum
in
thieves
slang
is
a
skilled
thief
a
professional
who
has
cut
himself
adrift
from
society
and
means
to
remain
a
thief
all
his
days
and
continues
faithful
through
thick
and
thin
to
the
laws
of
the
crime
and
madness
have
a
certain
resemblance
to
see
the
prisoners
of
the
conciergerie
in
the
yard
or
the
madmen
in
the
garden
of
an
asylum
is
much
the
same
thing
prisoners
and
lunatics
walk
to
and
fro
avoiding
each
other
looking
up
with
more
or
less
strange
or
vicious
glances
according
to
the
mood
of
the
moment
but
never
cheerful
never
grave
they
know
each
other
or
they
dread
each
other
the
anticipation
of
their
sentence
remorse
and
apprehension
give
all
these
men
exercising
the
anxious
furtive
look
of
the
insane
only
the
most
consummate
criminals
have
the
audacity
that
apes
the
quietude
of
respectability
the
sincerity
of
a
clear
conscience
as
men
of
the
better
class
are
few
and
shame
keeps
the
few
whose
crimes
have
brought
them
within
doors
the
frequenters
of
the
are
for
the
most
part
dressed
as
workmen
blouses
long
and
short
and
velveteen
jackets
preponderate
these
coarse
or
dirty
garments
harmonizing
with
the
coarse
and
sinister
faces
and
brutal
manner
somewhat
subdued
indeed
by
the
gloomy
reflections
that
weigh
on
men
in
prison
everything
to
the
silence
that
reigns
contributes
to
strike
terror
or
disgust
into
the
rare
visitor
who
by
high
influence
has
obtained
the
privilege
seldom
granted
of
going
over
the
conciergerie
just
as
the
sight
of
an
anatomical
museum
where
foul
diseases
are
represented
by
wax
models
makes
the
youth
who
may
be
taken
there
more
chaste
and
apt
for
nobler
and
purer
love
so
the
sight
of
the
conciergerie
and
of
the
filled
with
men
marked
for
the
hulks
or
the
scaffold
or
some
disgraceful
punishment
inspires
many
who
might
not
fear
that
divine
justice
whose
voice
speaks
so
loudly
to
the
conscience
with
a
fear
of
human
justice
and
they
come
out
honest
men
for
a
long
time
after
as
the
men
who
were
exercising
in
the
when
appeared
there
were
to
be
the
actors
in
a
scene
of
crowning
importance
in
the
life
of
jacques
collin
it
will
be
well
to
depict
a
few
of
the
principal
personages
of
this
sinister
crowd
here
as
everywhere
when
men
are
thrown
together
here
as
at
school
even
force
physical
and
moral
wins
the
day
here
then
as
on
the
hulks
crime
stamps
the
man
s
rank
those
whose
head
is
doomed
are
the
aristocracy
the
as
may
be
supposed
is
a
school
of
criminal
law
which
is
far
better
learned
there
than
at
the
hall
on
the
place
du
pantheon
a
pleasantry
is
to
rehearse
the
drama
of
the
assize
court
to
elect
a
president
a
jury
a
public
prosecutor
a
counsel
and
to
go
through
the
whole
trial
this
hideous
farce
is
played
before
almost
every
great
trial
at
this
time
a
famous
case
was
proceeding
in
the
criminal
court
that
of
the
dreadful
murder
committed
on
the
persons
of
monsieur
and
madame
crottat
the
notary
s
father
and
mother
retired
farmers
who
as
this
horrible
business
showed
kept
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
in
gold
in
their
house
one
of
the
men
concerned
in
this
double
murder
was
the
notorious
dannepont
known
as
la
pouraille
a
released
convict
who
for
five
years
had
eluded
the
most
active
search
on
the
part
of
the
police
under
the
protection
of
seven
or
eight
different
names
this
villain
s
disguises
were
so
perfect
that
he
had
served
two
years
of
imprisonment
under
the
name
of
delsouq
who
was
one
of
his
own
disciples
and
a
famous
thief
though
he
never
in
any
of
his
achievements
went
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
lower
courts
la
pouraille
had
committed
no
less
than
three
murders
since
his
dismissal
from
the
hulks
the
certainty
that
he
would
be
executed
not
less
than
the
large
fortune
he
was
supposed
to
have
made
this
man
an
object
of
terror
and
admiration
to
his
for
not
a
farthing
of
the
stolen
money
had
ever
been
recovered
even
after
the
events
of
july
some
persons
may
remember
the
terror
caused
in
paris
by
this
daring
crime
worthy
to
compare
in
importance
with
the
robbery
of
medals
from
the
public
library
for
the
unhappy
tendency
of
our
age
is
to
make
a
murder
the
more
interesting
in
proportion
to
the
greater
sum
of
money
secured
by
it
la
pouraille
a
small
lean
dry
man
with
a
face
like
a
ferret
years
old
and
one
of
the
celebrities
of
the
prisons
he
had
successively
lived
in
since
the
age
of
nineteen
knew
jacques
collin
well
how
and
why
will
be
seen
two
other
convicts
brought
with
la
pouraille
from
la
force
within
these
hours
had
at
once
acknowledged
and
made
the
whole
acknowledge
the
supremacy
of
this
sealed
to
the
scaffold
one
of
these
convicts
a
man
named
selerier
alias
l
avuergnat
pere
ralleau
and
le
rouleur
who
in
the
sphere
known
to
the
hulks
as
the
was
called
or
silken
thread
a
nickname
he
owed
to
the
skill
with
which
he
slipped
through
the
various
perils
of
the
business
was
an
old
ally
of
jacques
collin
s
so
keenly
suspected
of
playing
a
double
part
of
being
at
once
in
the
secrets
of
the
and
a
spy
laid
by
the
police
that
he
had
supposed
him
to
be
the
prime
mover
of
his
arrest
in
the
maison
vauquer
in
pere
selerier
whom
we
must
call
as
we
shall
also
call
dannepont
la
pouraille
already
guilty
of
evading
surveillance
was
concerned
in
certain
robberies
without
bloodshed
which
would
certainly
take
him
back
to
the
hulks
for
at
least
twenty
years
the
other
convict
named
riganson
and
his
kept
woman
known
as
la
biffe
were
a
most
formidable
couple
members
of
the
riganson
on
very
distant
terms
with
the
police
from
his
earliest
years
was
nicknamed
le
biffon
biffon
was
the
male
of
la
biffe
for
nothing
is
sacred
to
the
these
fiends
respect
nothing
neither
the
law
nor
religions
not
even
natural
history
whose
solemn
nomenclature
it
is
seen
is
parodied
by
them
here
a
digression
is
necessary
for
jacques
collin
s
appearance
in
the
in
the
midst
of
his
foes
as
had
been
so
cleverly
contrived
by
and
the
examining
judge
and
the
strange
scenes
to
ensue
would
be
incomprehensible
and
impossible
without
some
explanation
as
to
the
world
of
thieves
and
of
the
hulks
its
laws
its
manners
and
above
all
its
language
its
hideous
figures
of
speech
being
indispensable
in
this
portion
of
my
tale
so
first
of
all
a
few
words
must
be
said
as
to
the
vocabulary
of
sharpers
pickpockets
thieves
and
murderers
known
as
argot
or
thieves
cant
which
has
of
late
been
introduced
into
literature
with
so
much
success
that
more
than
one
word
of
that
strange
lingo
is
familiar
on
the
rosy
lips
of
ladies
has
been
heard
in
gilded
boudoirs
and
become
the
delight
of
princes
who
have
often
proclaimed
themselves
done
brown
floue
and
it
must
be
owned
to
the
surprise
no
doubt
of
many
persons
that
no
language
is
more
vigorous
or
more
vivid
than
that
of
this
underground
world
which
from
the
beginnings
of
countries
with
capitals
has
dwelt
in
cellars
and
slums
in
the
third
limbo
of
society
everywhere

le
troisieme
dessous
is
the
lowest
cellar
under

at
the

where
the

is
kept

men
stay
who
work
it
whence
the

are
raised
the
ghosts
the
shot
up
from

and
so
forth
every
word
of
this
language
is
a
bold
metaphor
ingenious

horrible
a
man

a
word
that
need
not
be
explained
in
this
language
you
do
not
sleep
you
snooze
or
doze
pioncer
and
note
how
vigorously
expressive
the
word
is
of
the
sleep
of
the
hunted
weary
distrustful
animal
called
a
thief
which
as
soon
as
it
is
in
safety
drops
rolls
into
the
gulf
of
deep
slumber
so
necessary
under
the
mighty
wings
of
suspicion
always
hovering
over
it
a
fearful
sleep
like
that
of
a
wild
beast
that
can
sleep
nay
and
snore
and
yet
its
ears
are
alert
with
caution
in
this
idiom
everything
is
savage
the
syllables
which
begin
or
end
the
words
are
harsh
and
curiously
startling
a
woman
is
a

or
a

it
is
poetical
too
straw

this
language
is
always
growing
it
keeps
pace
with
civilization
and
is
enriched
with
some
new
expression
by
every
fresh
invention
the

convicts

forthwith
investigated
this
contrivance
standing
as
it
did
on
the
monarchical
borderland
of
the
old
system
and
the
frontier
of
modern
legislation
they
instantly
gave
it
the
name
of
abbaye
de
they
looked
at
the
angle
formed
by
the
steel

and
described
its
action
as
repeating

and
when
it
is
remembered
that
the

are
called
the

le
pre
philologists
must
admire
the
inventiveness
of
these
horrible
vocables
as
charles
nodier
would
have
said
the
high
antiquity
of
this
kind
of
slang
is
also
noteworthy
a
tenth
of
the
words
are
of
old
romanesque
origin
another
tenth
are
the
old

the
name
given
to
the
head

still
on
the

la

shows
the
antiquity
of
this
dialect
which
is
mentioned
by
very
early
as
cervantes
the
italian
and
aretino
in
all
ages
the
moll
the
prostitute
the
heroine
of
so
many
romances
has
been
the
protectress
companion
and
comfort
of
the
sharper
the
thief
the
pickpocket
the
and
the
burglar
prostitution
and
robbery
are
the
male
and
female
forms
of
protest
made
by
the
natural
state
against
the
social
state
even
philosophers
the
innovators
of
the
humanitarians
with
the
communists
and
fourierists
in
their
train
come
at
last
without
knowing
it
to
the
same
conclusion
prostitution
and
theft
the
thief
does
not
argue
out
questions
of
property
of
inheritance
and
social
responsibility
in
sophistical
books
he
absolutely
ignores
them
to
him
theft
is
appropriating
his
own
he
does
not
discuss
marriage
he
does
not
complain
of
it
he
does
not
insist
in
printed
utopian
dreams
on
the
mutual
consent
and
bond
of
souls
which
can
never
become
general
he
pairs
with
a
vehemence
of
which
the
bonds
are
constantly
riveted
by
the
hammer
of
necessity
modern
innovators
write
unctuous
theories
long
drawn
and
nebulous
or
philanthropical
romances
but
the
thief
acts
he
is
as
clear
as
a
fact
as
logical
as
a
blow
and
then
his
style
another
thing
worth
noting
the
world
of
prostitutes
thieves
and
murders
of
the
galleys
and
the
prisons
forms
a
population
of
about
sixty
to
eighty
thousand
souls
men
and
women
such
a
world
is
not
to
be
disdained
in
a
picture
of
modern
manners
and
a
literary
reproduction
of
the
social
body
the
law
the
gendarmerie
and
the
police
constitute
a
body
almost
equal
in
number
is
not
that
strange
this
antagonism
of
persons
perpetually
seeking
and
avoiding
each
other
and
fighting
a
vast
and
highly
dramatic
duel
are
what
are
sketched
in
this
study
it
has
been
the
same
thing
with
thieving
and
public
harlotry
as
with
the
stage
the
police
the
priesthood
and
the
gendarmerie
in
these
six
walks
of
life
the
individual
contracts
an
indelible
character
he
can
no
longer
be
himself
the
stigmata
of
ordination
are
as
immutable
as
those
of
the
soldier
are
and
it
is
the
same
in
other
callings
which
are
strongly
in
opposition
strong
contrasts
with
civilization
these
violent
eccentric
singular
signs
sui
generis
are
what
make
the
harlot
the
robber
the
murderer
the
man
so
easily
recognizable
by
their
foes
the
spy
and
the
police
to
whom
they
are
as
game
to
the
sportsman
they
have
a
gait
a
manner
a
complexion
a
look
a
color
a
smell
in
short
infallible
marks
about
them
hence
the
art
of
disguise
which
the
heroes
of
the
hulks
acquire
one
word
yet
as
to
the
constitution
of
this
world
apart
which
the
abolition
of
branding
the
mitigation
of
penalties
and
the
silly
leniency
of
furies
are
making
a
threatening
evil
in
about
twenty
years
paris
will
be
beleaguered
by
an
army
of
forty
thousand
reprieved
criminals
the
department
of
the
seine
and
its
fifteen
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
being
the
only
place
in
france
where
these
poor
wretches
can
be
hidden
to
them
paris
is
what
the
virgin
forest
is
to
beasts
of
prey
the
or
more
exactly
the
upper
class
of
thieves
which
is
the
faubourg
the
aristocracy
of
the
tribe
had
in
after
the
peace
which
made
life
hard
for
so
many
men
formed
an
association
called
les
grands
fanandels
the
great
pals
consisting
of
the
most
noted
and
certain
bold
spirits
at
that
time
bereft
of
any
means
of
living
this
word
pal
means
brother
friend
and
comrade
all
in
one
and
these
great
pals
the
cream
of
the
thieving
fraternity
for
more
than
twenty
years
were
the
court
of
appeal
the
institute
of
learning
and
the
chamber
of
peers
of
this
community
these
men
all
had
their
private
means
with
funds
in
common
and
a
code
of
their
own
they
knew
each
other
and
were
pledged
to
help
and
succor
each
other
in
difficulties
and
they
were
all
superior
to
the
tricks
or
snares
of
the
police
had
a
charter
of
their
own
passwords
and
signs
of
recognition
from
to
these
dukes
and
peers
of
the
prison
world
had
formed
the
famous
association
of
the
see
pere
so
styled
by
reason
of
an
agreement
in
virtue
of
which
no
job
was
to
be
undertaken
by
which
less
than
ten
thousand
francs
could
be
got
at
that
very
time
in
some
memoirs
were
brought
out
in
which
the
collective
force
of
this
association
and
the
names
of
the
leaders
were
published
by
a
famous
member
of
the
it
was
terrifying
to
find
there
an
army
of
skilled
rogues
male
and
female
so
numerous
so
clever
so
constantly
lucky
that
such
thieves
as
pastourel
collonge
or
chimaux
men
of
fifty
and
sixty
were
described
as
outlaws
from
society
from
their
earliest
years
what
a
confession
of
the
ineptitude
of
justice
that
rogues
so
old
should
be
at
large
jacques
collin
had
been
the
cashier
not
only
of
the
but
also
of
the
great
pals
the
heroes
of
the
hulks
competent
authorities
admit
that
the
hulks
have
always
owned
large
sums
this
curious
fact
is
quite
conceivable
stolen
goods
are
never
recovered
but
in
very
singular
cases
the
condemned
criminal
who
can
take
nothing
with
him
is
obliged
to
trust
somebody
s
honesty
and
capacity
and
to
deposit
his
money
as
in
the
world
of
honest
folks
money
is
placed
in
a
bank
long
ago
now
for
ten
years
a
chief
of
the
department
of
public
safety
had
been
a
member
of
the
aristocracy
of
his
treason
had
resulted
from
offended
pride
he
had
been
constantly
set
aside
in
favor
of
superior
intelligence
and
prodigious
strength
hence
his
persistent
vindictiveness
against
jacques
collin
hence
also
certain
compromises
between
and
his
old
companions
which
the
magistrates
were
beginning
to
take
seriously
so
in
his
desire
for
vengeance
to
which
the
examining
judge
had
given
play
under
the
necessity
of
identifying
jacques
collin
the
chief
of
the
safety
had
very
skilfully
chosen
his
allies
by
setting
la
pouraille
and
le
biffon
on
the
sham
spaniard
for
la
pouraille
and
both
belonged
to
the
and
le
biffon
was
a
great
la
biffe
le
biffon
s
formidable
trip
who
to
this
day
evades
all
the
pursuit
of
the
police
by
her
skill
in
disguising
herself
as
a
lady
was
at
liberty
this
woman
who
successfully
apes
a
marquise
a
countess
a
baroness
keeps
a
carriage
and
this
jacques
collin
in
petticoats
is
the
only
woman
who
can
compare
with
asie
jacques
collin
s
right
hand
and
in
fact
every
hero
of
the
hulks
is
backed
up
by
a
devoted
woman
prison
records
and
the
secret
papers
of
the
law
courts
will
tell
you
this
no
honest
woman
s
love
not
even
that
of
the
bigot
for
her
spiritual
director
has
ever
been
greater
than
the
attachment
of
a
mistress
who
shares
the
dangers
of
a
great
criminal
with
these
men
a
passion
is
almost
always
the
first
cause
of
their
daring
enterprises
and
murders
the
excessive
love
which
constitutionally
as
the
doctors
say
makes
woman
irresistible
to
them
calls
every
moral
and
physical
force
of
these
powerful
natures
into
action
hence
the
idleness
which
consumes
their
days
for
excesses
of
passion
necessitate
sleep
and
restorative
food
hence
their
loathing
of
all
work
driving
these
creatures
to
have
recourse
to
rapid
ways
of
getting
money
and
yet
the
need
of
a
living
and
of
high
living
violent
as
it
is
is
but
a
trifle
in
comparison
with
the
extravagance
to
which
these
generous
medors
are
prompted
by
the
mistress
to
whom
they
want
to
give
jewels
and
dress
and
who
always
greedy
love
rich
food
the
baggage
wants
a
shawl
the
lover
steals
it
and
the
woman
sees
in
this
a
proof
of
love
this
is
how
robbery
begins
and
robbery
if
we
examine
the
human
soul
through
a
lens
will
be
seen
to
be
an
almost
natural
instinct
in
man
robbery
leads
to
murder
and
murder
leads
the
lover
step
by
step
to
the
scaffold
physical
desire
is
therefore
in
these
men
if
we
may
believe
the
medical
faculty
at
the
root
of
of
the
crimes
committed
and
indeed
the
proof
is
always
found
evident
palpable
at
the
examination
of
the
criminal
after
his
execution
and
these
monstrous
lovers
the
scarecrows
of
society
are
adored
by
their
mistresses
it
is
this
female
devotion
squatting
faithfully
at
the
prison
gate
always
eagerly
balking
the
cunning
of
the
examiner
and
incorruptibly
keeping
the
darkest
secrets
which
make
so
many
trials
impenetrable
mysteries
in
this
again
lies
the
strength
as
well
as
the
weakness
of
the
accused
in
the
vocabulary
of
a
prostitute
to
be
honest
means
to
break
none
of
the
laws
of
this
attachment
to
give
all
her
money
to
the
man
who
is
nabbed
to
look
after
his
comforts
to
be
faithful
to
him
in
every
way
to
undertake
anything
for
his
sake
the
bitterest
insult
one
of
these
women
can
fling
in
the
teeth
of
another
wretched
creature
is
to
accuse
her
of
infidelity
to
a
lover
in
quod
in
prison
in
that
case
such
a
woman
is
considered
to
have
no
heart
la
pouraille
was
passionately
in
love
with
a
woman
as
will
be
seen
an
egotistical
philosopher
who
thieved
to
provide
for
the
future
was
a
good
deal
like
paccard
jacques
collin
s
satellite
who
had
fled
with
prudence
servien
and
the
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
between
them
he
had
no
attachment
he
condemned
women
and
loved
no
one
but
as
to
le
biffon
he
derived
his
nickname
from
his
connection
with
la
biffe
la
biffe
is
scavenging
and
these
three
distinguished
members
of
haute
the
aristocracy
of
roguery
had
a
reckoning
to
demand
of
jacques
collin
accounts
that
were
somewhat
hard
to
bring
to
book
no
one
but
the
cashier
could
know
how
many
of
his
clients
were
still
alive
and
what
each
man
s
share
would
be
the
mortality
to
which
the
depositors
were
peculiarly
liable
had
formed
a
basis
for
calculations
when
he
resolved
to
embezzle
the
funds
for
lucien
s
benefit
by
keeping
himself
out
of
the
way
of
the
police
and
of
his
pals
for
nine
years
jacques
collin
was
almost
certain
to
have
fallen
heir
by
the
terms
of
the
agreement
among
the
associates
to
of
the
depositors
besides
could
he
not
plead
that
he
had
repaid
the
pals
who
had
been
scragged
in
fact
no
one
had
any
hold
over
these
his
comrades
trusted
him
by
compulsion
for
the
hunted
life
led
by
convicts
necessitates
the
most
delicate
confidence
between
the
gentry
of
this
crew
of
savages
so
jacques
collin
a
defaulter
for
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
might
now
possibly
be
quit
for
a
hundred
thousand
francs
at
this
moment
as
we
see
la
pouraille
one
of
jacques
collin
s
creditors
had
but
ninety
days
to
live
and
la
pouraille
the
possessor
of
a
sum
vastly
greater
no
doubt
than
that
placed
in
his
pal
s
keeping
would
probably
prove
easy
to
deal
with
one
of
the
infallible
signs
by
which
prison
governors
and
their
agents
the
police
and
warders
recognize
old
stagers
chevaux
de
retour
that
is
to
say
men
who
have
already
eaten
beans
les
gourganes
a
kind
of
haricots
provided
for
prison
fare
is
their
familiarity
with
prison
ways
those
who
have
been
before
of
course
know
the
manners
and
customs
they
are
at
home
and
nothing
surprises
them
and
jacques
collin
thoroughly
on
his
guard
had
until
now
played
his
part
to
admiration
as
an
innocent
man
and
stranger
both
at
la
force
and
at
the
conciergerie
but
now
broken
by
grief
and
by
two
deaths
for
he
had
died
twice
over
during
that
dreadful
night
he
was
jacques
collin
once
more
the
warder
was
astounded
to
find
that
the
spanish
priest
needed
no
telling
as
to
the
way
to
the
the
perfect
actor
forgot
his
part
he
went
down
the
corkscrew
stairs
in
the
tour
bonbec
as
one
who
knew
the
conciergerie
is
right
said
the
turnkey
to
himself
he
is
an
old
stager
he
is
jacques
at
the
moment
when
appeared
in
the
sort
of
frame
to
his
figure
made
by
the
door
into
the
tower
the
prisoners
having
made
their
purchases
at
the
stone
table
called
after
were
scattered
about
the
yard
always
too
small
for
their
number
so
the
newcomer
was
seen
by
all
of
them
at
once
and
all
the
more
promptly
because
nothing
can
compare
for
keenness
with
the
eye
of
a
prisoner
who
in
a
feels
like
a
spider
watching
in
its
web
and
this
comparison
is
mathematically
exact
for
the
range
of
vision
being
limited
on
all
sides
by
high
dark
walls
the
prisoners
can
always
see
even
without
looking
at
them
the
doors
through
which
the
warders
come
and
go
the
windows
of
the
parlor
and
the
stairs
of
the
tour
bonbec
the
only
exits
from
the
yard
in
this
utter
isolation
every
trivial
incident
is
an
event
everything
is
interesting
the
tedium
a
tedium
like
that
of
a
tiger
in
a
cage
increases
their
alertness
tenfold
it
is
necessary
to
note
that
jacques
collin
dressed
like
a
priest
who
is
not
strict
as
to
costume
wore
black
knee
breeches
black
stockings
shoes
with
silver
buckles
a
black
waistcoat
and
a
long
coat
of
cloth
of
a
certain
cut
that
betrays
the
priest
whatever
he
may
do
especially
when
these
details
are
completed
by
a
characteristic
style
of
haircutting
jacques
collin
s
wig
was
eminently
ecclesiastical
and
wonderfully
natural
hallo
said
la
pouraille
to
le
biffon
that
s
a
bad
sign
a
rook
sanglier
a
priest
how
did
he
come
here
he
is
one
of
their
narks
trucs
spies
of
a
new
make
replied
some
runner
with
the
bracelets
marchand
de
lacets
equivalent
to
a
bow
street
runner
looking
out
for
his
the
gendarme
boasts
of
many
names
in
french
slang
when
he
is
after
a
thief
he
is
the
man
with
the
bracelets
marchand
de
lacets
when
he
has
him
in
charge
he
is
a
bird
of
hirondelle

when
he
escorts
him
to
the
scaffold
he
is
groom
to
the
guillotine
hussard
de

to
complete
our
study
of
the
two
more
of
the
prisoners
must
be
hastily
sketched
in
selerier
alias
l
auvergnat
alias
le
pere
ralleau
called
le
rouleur
alias
he
had
thirty
names
and
as
many
passports
will
henceforth
be
spoken
of
by
this
name
only
as
he
was
called
by
no
other
among
the
this
profound
philosopher
who
saw
a
spy
in
the
sham
priest
was
a
brawny
fellow
of
about
five
feet
eight
whose
muscles
were
all
marked
by
strange
bosses
he
had
an
enormous
head
in
which
a
pair
of
eyes
sparkled
like
fire
the
eyes
of
a
bird
of
prey
with
gray
dull
skinny
eyelids
at
first
glance
his
face
resembled
that
of
a
wolf
his
jaws
were
so
broad
powerful
and
prominent
but
the
cruelty
and
even
ferocity
suggested
by
this
likeness
were
counterbalanced
by
the
cunning
and
eagerness
of
his
face
though
it
was
scarred
by
the
smallpox
the
margin
of
each
scar
being
sharply
cut
gave
a
sort
of
wit
to
his
expression
it
was
seamed
with
ironies
the
life
of
a
criminal
a
life
of
danger
and
thirst
of
nights
spent
bivouacking
on
the
quays
and
river
banks
on
bridges
and
streets
and
the
orgies
of
strong
drink
by
which
successes
are
celebrated
had
laid
as
it
were
a
varnish
over
these
features
if
seen
in
his
undisguised
person
would
have
been
marked
by
any
constable
or
gendarme
as
his
prey
but
he
was
a
match
for
jacques
collin
in
the
arts
of
and
dress
just
now
in
undress
like
a
great
actor
who
is
well
got
up
only
on
the
stage
wore
a
sort
of
shooting
jacket
bereft
of
buttons
and
whose
ripped
showed
the
white
lining
squalid
green
slippers
nankin
trousers
now
a
dingy
gray
and
on
his
head
a
cap
without
a
peak
under
which
an
old
bandana
was
tied
streaky
with
rents
and
washed
out
le
biffon
was
a
complete
contrast
to
this
famous
robber
short
burly
and
fat
but
active
with
a
livid
complexion
and
black
eyes
dressed
like
a
cook
standing
squarely
on
very
bandy
legs
was
alarming
to
behold
for
in
his
countenance
all
the
features
predominated
that
are
most
typical
of
the
carnivorous
beast
and
le
biffon
were
always
wheedling
la
pouraille
who
had
lost
all
hope
the
murderer
knew
that
he
would
be
tried
sentenced
and
executed
within
four
months
indeed
and
le
biffon
la
pouraille
s
chums
never
called
him
anything
but
chanoine
de
l
abbaye
de
a
grim
paraphrase
for
a
man
condemned
to
the
guillotine
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
and
le
biffon
should
fawn
on
la
pouraille
the
man
had
somewhere
hidden
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
in
gold
his
share
of
the
spoil
found
in
the
house
of
the
crottats
the
victims
in
newspaper
phrase
what
a
splendid
fortune
to
leave
to
two
pals
though
the
two
old
stagers
would
be
sent
back
to
the
galleys
within
a
few
days
le
biffon
and
would
be
sentenced
for
a
term
of
fifteen
years
for
robbery
with
violence
without
prejudice
to
the
ten
years
penal
servitude
on
a
former
sentence
which
they
had
taken
the
liberty
of
cutting
short
so
though
one
had
and
the
other
years
of
imprisonment
to
look
forward
to
they
both
hoped
to
escape
and
come
back
to
find
la
pouraille
s
mine
of
gold
but
the
man
kept
his
secret
he
did
not
see
the
use
of
telling
it
before
he
was
sentenced
he
belonged
to
the
upper
ten
of
the
hulks
and
had
never
betrayed
his
accomplices
his
temper
was
well
known
monsieur
popinot
who
had
examined
him
had
not
been
able
to
get
anything
out
of
him
this
terrible
trio
were
at
the
further
end
of
the
that
is
to
say
near
the
better
class
of
cells
was
giving
a
lecture
to
a
young
man
who
was
in
for
his
first
offence
and
who
being
certain
of
ten
years
penal
servitude
was
gaining
information
as
to
the
various
convict
establishments
well
my
boy
was
saying
sententiously
as
jacques
collin
appeared
on
the
scene
the
difference
between
brest
toulon
and
rochefort
is
well
old
cock
said
the
lad
with
the
curiosity
of
a
novice
this
prisoner
a
man
of
good
family
accused
of
forgery
had
come
down
from
the
cell
next
to
that
where
lucien
had
been
my
son
went
on
at
brest
you
are
sure
to
get
some
beans
at
the
third
turn
if
you
dip
your
spoon
in
the
bowl
at
toulon
you
never
get
any
till
the
fifth
and
at
rochefort
you
get
none
at
all
unless
you
are
an
old
having
spoken
the
philosopher
joined
le
biffon
and
la
pouraille
and
all
three
greatly
puzzled
by
the
priest
walked
down
the
yard
while
jacques
collin
lost
in
grief
came
up
it
absorbed
in
terrible
meditations
the
meditations
of
a
fallen
emperor
did
not
think
of
himself
as
the
centre
of
observation
the
object
of
general
attention
and
he
walked
slowly
gazing
at
the
fatal
window
where
lucien
had
hanged
himself
none
of
the
prisoners
knew
of
this
catastrophe
since
for
reasons
to
be
presently
explained
the
young
forger
had
not
mentioned
the
subject
the
three
pals
agreed
to
cross
the
priest
s
path
he
is
no
priest
said
he
is
an
old
stager
look
how
he
drags
his
right
it
is
needful
to
explain
here
for
not
every
reader
has
had
a
fancy
to
visit
the
galleys
that
each
convict
is
chained
to
another
an
old
one
and
a
young
one
always
as
a
couple
the
weight
of
this
chain
riveted
to
a
ring
above
the
ankle
is
so
great
as
to
induce
a
limp
which
the
convict
never
loses
being
obliged
to
exert
one
leg
much
more
than
the
other
to
drag
this
fetter
manicle
is
the
slang
name
for
such
irons
the
prisoner
inevitably
gets
into
the
habit
of
making
the
effort
afterwards
though
he
no
longer
wears
the
chain
it
acts
upon
him
still
as
a
man
still
feels
an
amputated
leg
the
convict
is
always
conscious
of
the
anklet
and
can
never
get
over
that
trick
of
walking
in
police
slang
he
drags
his
and
this
sign
as
well
known
to
convicts
among
themselves
as
it
is
to
the
police
even
if
it
does
not
help
to
identify
a
comrade
at
any
rate
confirms
recognition
in
who
had
escaped
eight
years
since
this
trick
had
to
a
great
extent
worn
off
but
just
now
lost
in
reflections
he
walked
at
such
a
slow
and
solemn
pace
that
slight
as
the
limp
was
it
was
strikingly
evident
to
so
practiced
an
eye
as
la
pouraille
s
and
it
is
quite
intelligible
that
convicts
always
thrown
together
as
they
must
be
and
never
having
any
one
else
to
study
will
so
thoroughly
have
watched
each
other
s
faces
and
appearance
that
certain
tricks
will
have
impressed
them
which
may
escape
their
systematic
foes
spies
gendarmes
and
thus
it
was
a
peculiar
twitch
of
the
maxillary
muscles
of
the
left
cheek
recognized
by
a
convict
who
was
sent
to
a
review
of
the
legion
of
the
seine
which
led
to
the
arrest
of
the
of
that
corps
the
famous
coignard
for
in
spite
of
s
confidence
the
police
could
not
dare
believe
that
the
comte
pontis
de
and
coignard
were
one
and
the
same
man
he
is
our
boss
dab
or
master
said
seeing
in
jacques
collin
s
eyes
the
vague
glance
a
man
sunk
in
despair
casts
on
all
his
surroundings
by
jingo
yes
it
is
said
le
biffon
rubbing
his
hands
yes
it
is
his
cut
his
build
but
what
has
he
done
to
himself
he
looks
quite
i
know
what
he
is
up
to
cried
he
has
some
plan
in
his
head
he
wants
to
see
the
boy
sa
tante
who
is
to
be
executed
before
the
persons
known
in
prison
as
tantes
or
aunts
may
be
best
described
in
the
ingenious
words
of
the
governor
of
one
of
the
great
prisons
to
the
late
lord
durham
who
during
his
stay
in
paris
visited
every
prison
so
curious
was
he
to
see
every
detail
of
french
justice
that
he
even
persuaded
sanson
at
that
time
the
executioner
to
erect
the
scaffold
and
decapitate
a
living
calf
that
he
might
thoroughly
understand
the
working
of
the
machine
made
famous
by
the
revolution
the
governor
having
shown
him
everything
the
yards
the
workshops
and
the
underground
cells
pointed
to
a
part
of
the
building
and
said
i
need
not
take
your
lordship
there
it
is
the
quartier
des
oh
said
lord
durham
what
are
they
the

a
pretty

and
such
a

a
loss
to

yes
theodore

is
yamming
his
last

said
le
biffon
his
trips
will
pipe
their

for
the
little
beggar

a
great
so
you
re
here
old
chap
said
la
pouraille
to
jacques
collin
and
with
his
two
acolytes
he
barred
the
way
to
the
new
arrival
why
boss
have
you
got
yourself
japanned
he
went
on
i
hear
you
have
nobbled
our
pile
stolen
our
money
le
biffon
added
in
a
threatening
tone
you
have
just
got
to
stump
up
the
tin
said
the
three
questions
were
fired
at
him
like
three
do
not
make
game
of
an
unhappy
priest
sent
here
by
mistake
jacques
collin
replied
mechanically
recognizing
his
three
comrades
that
is
the
sound
of
his
pipe
if
it
is
not
quite
the
cut
of
his
mug
said
la
pouraille
laying
his
hand
on
jacques
collin
s
shoulder
this
action
and
the
sight
of
his
three
chums
startled
the
boss
out
of
his
dejection
and
brought
him
back
to
a
consciousness
of
reality
for
during
that
dreadful
night
he
had
lost
himself
in
the
infinite
spiritual
world
of
feeling
seeking
some
new
road
do
not
blow
the
gaff
on
your
boss
said
jacques
collin
in
a
hollow
threatening
tone
not
unlike
the
low
growl
of
a
lion
the
reelers
are
here
let
them
make
fools
of
themselves
i
am
faking
to
help
a
pal
who
is
awfully
down
on
his
he
spoke
with
the
unction
of
a
priest
trying
to
convert
the
wretched
and
a
look
which
flashed
round
the
yard
took
in
the
warders
under
the
archways
and
pointed
them
out
with
a
wink
to
his
three
companions

jacques

repressing
a
start
and
a
cry

nut
off
la
pouraille
went
on
he
was
booked
for
the
scaffold
two
months
jacques
collin
felt
sick
his
knees
almost
failed
him
but
his
three
comrades
held
him
up
and
he
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
clasp
his
hands
with
an
expression
of
contrition
la
pouraille
and
le
biffon
respectfully
supported
the
sacrilegious
while
ran
to
a
warder
on
guard
at
the
gate
leading
to
the
parlor
that
venerable
priest
wants
to
sit
down
send
out
a
chair
for
him
said
he
and
so
s
plot
had
failed
like
a
napoleon
recognized
by
his
soldiers
had
won
the
submission
and
respect
of
the
three
felons
two
words
had
done
it
your
molls
and
your
blunt
your
women
and
your
money
epitomizing
every
true
affection
of
man
this
threat
was
to
the
three
convicts
an
indication
of
supreme
power
the
boss
still
had
their
fortune
in
his
hands
still
omnipotent
outside
the
prison
their
boss
had
not
betrayed
them
as
the
false
pals
said
their
chief
s
immense
reputation
for
skill
and
inventiveness
stimulated
their
curiosity
for
in
prison
curiosity
is
the
only
goad
of
these
blighted
spirits
and
jacques
collin
s
daring
disguise
kept
up
even
under
the
bolts
and
locks
of
the
conciergerie
dazzled
the
three
felons
i
have
been
in
close
confinement
for
four
days
and
did
not
know
that
theodore
was
so
near
the
abbaye
said
jacques
collin
i
came
in
to
save
a
poor
little
chap
who
scragged
himself
here
yesterday
at
four
o
clock
and
now
here
is
another
misfortune
i
have
not
an
ace
in
my
hand
poor
old
boy
said
old
scratch
has
cut
me
cried
jacques
collin
tearing
himself
free
from
his
supporters
and
drawing
himself
up
with
a
fierce
look
there
comes
a
time
when
the
world
is
too
many
for
us
the
beaks
gobble
us
up
at
the
governor
of
the
conciergerie
informed
of
the
spanish
priest
s
weak
state
came
himself
to
the
to
observe
him
he
made
him
sit
down
on
a
chair
in
the
sun
studying
him
with
the
keen
acumen
which
increases
day
by
day
in
the
practise
of
such
functions
though
hidden
under
an
appearance
of
indifference
oh
heaven
cried
jacques
collin
to
be
mixed
up
with
such
creatures
the
dregs
of
society
felons
and
murders
but
god
will
not
desert
his
servant
my
dear
sir
my
stay
here
shall
be
marked
by
deeds
of
charity
which
shall
live
in
men
s
memories
i
will
convert
these
unhappy
creatures
they
shall
learn
they
have
souls
that
life
eternal
awaits
them
and
that
though
they
have
lost
all
on
earth
they
still
may
win

genuine
twenty
or
thirty
prisoners
had
gathered
in
a
group
behind
the
three
terrible
convicts
whose
ferocious
looks
had
kept
a
space
of
three
feet
between
them
and
their
inquisitive
companions
and
they
heard
this
address
spoken
with
evangelical
unction
ay
monsieur
gault
said
the
formidable
la
pouraille
we
will
listen
to
what
this
one
may
say
i
have
been
told
jacques
collin
went
on
that
there
is
in
this
prison
a
man
condemned
to
the
rejection
of
his
appeal
is
at
this
moment
being
read
to
him
said
monsieur
gault
i
do
not
know
what
that
means
said
jacques
collin
artlessly
looking
about
him
golly
what
a
flat
said
the
young
fellow
who
a
few
minutes
since
had
asked
about
the
beans
on
the
hulks
why
it
means
that
he
is
to
be
scragged
or
scragged
asked
jacques
collin
whose
air
of
innocence
and
ignorance
filled
his
three
pals
with
admiration
in
their
slang
said
the
governor
that
means
that
he
will
suffer
the
penalty
of
death
if
the
clerk
is
reading
the
appeal
the
executioner
will
no
doubt
have
orders
for
the
execution
the
unhappy
man
has
persistently
refused
the
offices
of
the
ah
monsieur
le
directeaur
this
is
a
soul
to
save
cried
jacques
collin
and
the
sacrilegious
wretch
clasped
his
hands
with
the
expression
of
a
despairing
lover
which
to
the
watchful
governor
seemed
nothing
less
than
divine
fervor
ah
monsieur
went
on
let
me
prove
to
you
what
i
am
and
how
much
i
can
do
by
allowing
me
to
incite
that
hardened
heart
to
repentance
god
has
given
me
a
power
of
speech
which
produces
great
changes
i
crush
men
s
hearts
i
open
what
are
you
afraid
of
send
me
with
an
escort
of
gendarmes
of
turnkeys
whom
you
i
will
inquire
whether
the
prison
chaplain
will
allow
you
to
take
his
place
said
monsieur
gault
and
the
governor
withdrew
struck
by
the
expression
perfectly
indifferent
though
inquisitive
with
which
the
convicts
and
the
prisoners
on
remand
stared
at
this
priest
whose
unctuous
tones
lent
a
charm
to
his
lingo
how
did
you
come
in
here
monsieur
l
abbe
asked
the
youth
who
had
questioned
oh
by
a
mistake
replied
jacques
collin
eyeing
the
young
gentleman
from
head
to
foot
i
was
found
in
the
house
of
a
courtesan
who
had
died
and
was
immediately
robbed
it
was
proved
that
she
had
killed
herself
and
the
thieves
probably
the
servants
have
not
yet
been
and
it
was
for
that
theft
that
your
young
man
hanged
himself
the
poor
boy
no
doubt
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
being
blighted
by
his
unjust
imprisonment
said
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
ay
said
the
young
man
they
were
coming
to
set
him
free
just
when
he
had
killed
himself
what
bad
luck
only
innocent
souls
can
be
thus
worked
on
by
their
imagination
said
jacques
collin
for
observe
he
was
the
loser
by
the
how
much
money
was
it
asked
the
deep
and
cunning
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
said
jacques
collin
blandly
the
three
convicts
looked
at
each
other
and
withdrew
from
the
group
that
had
gathered
round
the
sham
priest
he
screwed
the
moll
s
place
himself
said
in
a
whisper
to
le
biffon
and
they
want
to
put
us
in
a
blue
funk
for
our
cartwheels
thunes
de
balles
pieces
he
will
always
be
the
boss
of
the
swells
replied
la
pouraille
our
pieces
are
safe
la
pouraille
wishing
to
find
some
man
he
could
trust
had
an
interest
in
considering
jacques
collin
an
honest
man
and
in
prison
of
all
places
a
man
believes
what
he
hopes
i
lay
you
anything
he
will
come
round
the
big
boss
and
save
his
chum
said
if
he
does
that
said
le
biffon
though
i
don
t
believe
he
is
really
god
he
must
certainly
have
smoked
a
pipe
with
old
scratch
as
they
didn
t
you
hear
him
say
old
scratch
has
cut
me
said
oh
cried
la
pouraille
if
only
he
would
save
my
nut
what
a
time
i
would
have
with
my
whack
of
the
shiners
and
the
yellow
boys
i
have
do
what
he
bids
you
said
soie
you
don
t
say
so
retorted
la
pouraille
looking
at
his
pal
what
a
flat
you
are
you
will
be
booked
for
the
abbaye
said
le
biffon
you
have
no
other
door
to
budge
if
you
want
to
keep
on
your
pins
to
yam
wet
your
whistle
and
fake
to
the
end
you
must
take
his
that
s
all
right
said
la
pouraille
there
is
not
one
of
us
that
will
blow
the
gaff
or
if
he
does
i
will
take
him
where
i
am
going
and
he
ll
do
it
too
cried
the
least
sympathetic
reader
who
has
no
pity
for
this
strange
race
may
conceive
of
the
state
of
mind
of
jacques
collin
finding
himself
between
the
dead
body
of
the
idol
whom
he
had
been
bewailing
during
five
hours
that
night
and
the
imminent
end
of
his
former
comrade
the
dead
body
of
theodore
the
young
corsican
only
to
see
the
boy
would
demand
extraordinary
cleverness
to
save
him
would
need
a
miracle
but
he
was
thinking
of
it
for
the
better
comprehension
of
what
jacques
collin
proposed
to
attempt
it
must
be
remarked
that
murderers
and
thieves
all
the
men
who
people
the
galleys
are
not
so
formidable
as
is
generally
supposed
with
a
few
rare
exceptions
these
creatures
are
all
cowards
in
consequence
no
doubt
of
the
constant
alarms
which
weigh
on
their
spirit
the
faculties
being
perpetually
on
the
stretch
in
thieving
and
the
success
of
a
stroke
of
business
depending
on
the
exertion
of
every
vital
force
with
a
readiness
of
wit
to
match
their
dexterity
of
hand
and
an
alertness
which
exhausts
the
nervous
system
these
violent
exertions
of
will
once
over
they
become
stupid
just
as
a
singer
or
a
dancer
drops
quite
exhausted
after
a
fatiguing
pas
seul
or
one
of
those
tremendous
duets
which
modern
composers
inflict
on
the
public
malefactors
are
in
fact
so
entirely
bereft
of
common
sense
or
so
much
oppressed
by
fear
that
they
become
absolutely
childish
credulous
to
the
last
degree
they
are
caught
by
the
of
the
simplest
snare
when
they
have
done
a
successful
they
are
in
such
a
state
of
prostration
that
they
immediately
rush
into
the
debaucheries
they
crave
for
they
get
drunk
on
wine
and
spirits
and
throw
themselves
madly
into
the
arms
of
their
women
to
recover
composure
by
dint
of
exhausting
their
strength
and
to
forget
their
crime
by
forgetting
their
reason
then
they
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
police
when
once
they
are
in
custody
they
lose
their
head
and
long
for
hope
so
blindly
that
they
believe
anything
indeed
there
is
nothing
too
absurd
for
them
to
accept
it
an
instance
will
suffice
to
show
how
far
the
simplicity
of
a
criminal
who
has
been
will
carry
him
not
long
before
had
extracted
a
confession
from
a
murderer
of
nineteen
by
making
him
believe
that
no
one
under
age
was
ever
executed
when
this
lad
was
transferred
to
the
conciergerie
to
be
sentenced
after
the
rejection
of
his
appeal
this
terrible
man
came
to
see
him
are
you
sure
you
are
not
yet
twenty
said
he
yes
i
am
only
nineteen
and
a
well
then
replied
you
may
be
quite
sure
of
one
thing
you
will
never
see
why
because
you
will
be
scragged
within
three
days
replied
the
police
agent
the
murderer
who
had
believed
even
after
sentence
was
passed
that
a
minor
would
never
be
executed
collapsed
like
an
omelette
soufflee
such
men
cruel
only
from
the
necessity
for
suppressive
evidence
for
they
murder
only
to
get
rid
of
witnesses
and
this
is
one
of
the
arguments
adduced
by
those
who
desire
the
abrogation
of
capital
punishment
these
giants
of
dexterity
and
skill
whose
sleight
of
hand
whose
rapid
sight
whose
every
sense
is
as
alert
as
that
of
a
savage
are
heroes
of
evil
only
on
the
stage
of
their
exploits
not
only
do
their
difficulties
begin
as
soon
as
the
crime
is
committed
for
they
are
as
much
bewildered
by
the
need
for
concealing
the
stolen
goods
as
they
were
depressed
by
necessity
but
they
are
as
weak
as
a
woman
in
childbed
the
vehemence
of
their
schemes
is
terrific
in
success
they
become
like
children
in
a
word
their
nature
is
that
of
the
wild
beast
easy
to
kill
when
it
is
full
fed
in
prison
these
strange
beings
are
men
in
dissimulation
and
in
secretiveness
which
never
yields
till
the
last
moment
when
they
are
crushed
and
broken
by
the
tedium
of
imprisonment
it
may
hence
be
understood
how
it
was
that
the
three
convicts
instead
of
betraying
their
chief
were
eager
to
serve
him
and
as
they
suspected
he
was
now
the
owner
of
the
stolen
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
they
admired
him
for
his
calm
resignation
under
bolt
and
bar
of
the
conciergerie
believing
him
capable
of
protecting
them
all
when
monsieur
gault
left
the
sham
priest
he
returned
through
the
parlor
to
his
office
and
went
in
search
of
who
for
twenty
minutes
since
jacques
collin
had
gone
downstairs
had
been
on
the
watch
with
his
eye
at
a
peephole
in
a
window
looking
out
on
the
not
one
of
them
recognized
him
said
monsieur
gault
and
napolitas
who
is
on
duty
did
not
hear
a
word
the
poor
priest
all
through
the
night
in
his
deep
distress
did
not
say
a
word
which
could
imply
that
his
gown
covers
jacques
that
shows
that
he
is
used
to
prison
life
said
the
police
agent
napolitas
s
secretary
being
unknown
to
the
criminals
then
in
the
conciergerie
was
playing
the
part
of
the
young
gentlemen
imprisoned
for
forgery
well
but
he
wishes
to
be
allowed
to
hear
the
confession
of
the
young
fellow
who
is
sentenced
to
death
said
the
governor
to
be
sure
that
is
our
last
chance
cried
i
had
forgotten
that
theodore
calvi
the
young
corsican
was
the
man
chained
to
jacques
collin
they
say
that
on
the
hulks
jacques
collin
made
him
famous
pads
the
convicts
on
the
galleys
contrive
a
kind
of
pad
to
slip
between
their
skin
and
the
fetters
to
deaden
the
pressure
of
the
iron
ring
on
their
ankles
and
instep
these
pads
made
of
tow
and
rags
are
known
as
patarasses
who
is
warder
over
the
man
asked
coeur
la
very
well
i
will
go
and
make
up
as
a
gendarme
and
be
on
the
watch
i
shall
hear
what
they
say
i
will
be
even
with
but
if
it
should
be
jacques
collin
are
you
not
afraid
of
his
recognizing
you
and
throttling
you
said
the
governor
to
as
a
gendarme
i
shall
have
my
sword
replied
the
other
and
besides
if
he
is
jacques
collin
he
will
never
do
anything
that
will
risk
his
neck
and
if
he
is
a
priest
i
shall
be
then
you
have
no
time
to
lose
said
monsieur
gault
it
is
eight
father
sauteloup
has
just
read
the
reply
to
his
appeal
and
monsieur
sanson
is
waiting
in
the
order
yes
it
is
s
job
the
widow
s
huzzars
les
hussards
de
la
veuve
another
horrible
name
for
the
functionaries
of
the
guillotine
are
ordered
out
replied
still
i
can
not
wonder
that
the
should
hesitate
the
boy
has
always
declared
that
he
is
innocent
and
there
is
in
my
opinion
no
conclusive
evidence
against
he
is
a
thorough
corsican
said
monsieur
gault
he
has
not
said
a
word
and
has
held
firm
all
the
last
words
of
the
governor
of
the
prison
summed
up
the
dismal
tale
of
a
man
condemned
to
die
a
man
cut
off
from
among
the
living
by
law
belongs
to
the
bench
the
bench
is
paramount
it
is
answerable
to
nobody
it
obeys
its
own
conscience
the
prison
belongs
to
the
bench
which
controls
it
absolutely
poetry
has
taken
possession
of
this
social
theme
the
man
condemned
to
death
a
subject
truly
apt
to
strike
the
imagination
and
poetry
has
been
sublime
on
it
prose
has
no
resource
but
fact
still
the
fact
is
appalling
enough
to
hold
its
own
against
verse
the
existence
of
a
condemned
man
who
has
not
confessed
his
crime
or
betrayed
his
accomplices
is
one
of
fearful
torment
this
is
no
case
of
iron
boots
of
water
poured
into
the
stomach
or
of
limbs
racked
by
hideous
machinery
it
is
hidden
and
so
to
speak
negative
torture
the
condemned
wretch
is
given
over
to
himself
with
a
companion
whom
he
can
not
but
trust
the
amiability
of
modern
philanthropy
fancies
it
has
understood
the
dreadful
torment
of
isolation
but
this
is
a
mistake
since
the
abolition
of
torture
the
bench
in
a
natural
anxiety
to
reassure
the
too
sensitive
consciences
of
the
jury
had
guessed
what
a
terrible
auxiliary
isolation
would
prove
to
justice
in
seconding
remorse
solitude
is
void
and
nature
has
as
great
a
horror
of
a
moral
void
as
she
has
of
a
physical
vacuum
solitude
is
habitable
only
to
a
man
of
genius
who
can
people
it
with
ideas
the
children
of
the
spiritual
world
or
to
one
who
contemplates
the
works
of
the
creator
to
whom
it
is
bright
with
the
light
of
heaven
alive
with
the
breath
and
voice
of
god
excepting
for
these
two
beings
so
near
to
paradise
solitude
is
to
the
mind
what
torture
is
to
the
body
between
solitude
and
the
there
is
all
the
difference
that
there
is
between
a
nervous
malady
and
a
surgical
disease
it
is
suffering
multiplied
by
infinitude
the
body
borders
on
the
infinite
through
its
nerves
as
the
spirit
does
through
thought
and
in
fact
in
the
annals
of
the
paris
law
courts
the
criminals
who
do
not
confess
can
be
easily
counted
this
terrible
situation
which
in
some
cases
assumes
appalling
importance
in
politics
for
instance
when
a
dynasty
or
a
state
is
involved
will
find
a
place
in
the
human
comedy
but
here
a
description
of
the
stone
box
in
which
after
the
restoration
the
law
shut
up
a
man
condemned
to
death
in
paris
may
serve
to
give
an
idea
of
the
terrors
of
a
felon
s
last
day
on
earth
before
the
revolution
of
july
there
was
in
the
conciergerie
and
indeed
there
still
is
a
condemned
cell
this
room
backing
on
the
governor
s
office
is
divided
from
it
by
a
thick
wall
in
strong
masonry
and
the
other
side
of
it
is
formed
by
a
wall
seven
or
eight
feet
thick
which
supports
one
end
of
the
immense
des
it
is
entered
through
the
first
door
in
the
long
dark
passage
in
which
the
eye
loses
itself
when
looking
from
the
middle
of
the
vaulted
gateway
this
room
is
lighted
by
a
funnel
barred
by
a
formidable
grating
and
hardly
perceptible
on
going
into
the
conciergerie
yard
for
it
has
been
pierced
in
the
narrow
space
between
the
office
window
close
to
the
railing
of
the
gateway
and
the
place
where
the
office
clerk
sits
a
den
like
a
cupboard
contrived
by
the
architect
at
the
end
of
the
entrance
court
this
position
accounts
for
the
fact
that
the
room
thus
enclosed
between
four
immensely
thick
walls
should
have
been
devoted
when
the
conciergerie
was
reconstituted
to
this
terrible
and
funereal
service
escape
is
impossible
the
passage
leading
to
the
cells
for
solitary
confinement
and
to
the
women
s
quarters
faces
the
stove
where
gendarmes
and
warders
are
always
collected
together
the
the
only
outlet
to
the
open
air
is
nine
feet
above
the
floor
and
looks
out
on
the
first
court
which
is
guarded
by
sentries
at
the
outer
gate
no
human
power
can
make
any
impression
on
the
walls
besides
a
man
sentenced
to
death
is
at
once
secured
in
a
straitwaistcoat
a
garment
which
precludes
all
use
of
the
hands
he
is
chained
by
one
foot
to
his
camp
bed
and
he
has
a
fellow
prisoner
to
watch
and
attend
on
him
the
room
is
paved
with
thick
flags
and
the
light
is
so
dim
that
it
is
hard
to
see
anything
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
chilled
to
the
marrow
on
going
in
even
now
though
for
sixteen
years
the
cell
has
never
been
used
in
consequence
of
the
changes
effected
in
paris
in
the
treatment
of
criminals
under
sentence
imagine
the
guilty
man
there
with
his
remorse
for
company
in
silence
and
darkness
two
elements
of
horror
and
you
will
wonder
how
he
ever
failed
to
go
mad
what
a
nature
must
that
be
whose
temper
can
resist
such
treatment
with
the
added
misery
of
enforced
idleness
and
inaction
and
yet
theodore
calvi
a
corsican
now
years
of
age
muffled
as
it
were
in
a
shroud
of
absolute
reserve
had
for
two
months
held
out
against
the
effects
of
this
dungeon
and
the
insidious
chatter
of
the
prisoner
placed
to
entrap
him
these
were
the
strange
circumstances
under
which
the
corsican
had
been
condemned
to
death
though
the
case
is
a
very
curious
one
our
account
of
it
must
be
brief
it
is
impossible
to
introduce
a
long
digression
at
the
climax
of
a
narrative
already
so
much
prolonged
since
its
only
interest
is
in
so
far
as
it
concerns
jacques
collin
the
vertebral
column
so
to
speak
which
by
its
sinister
persistency
connects
pere
with
and
with
this
study
and
indeed
the
reader
s
imagination
will
be
able
to
work
out
the
obscure
case
which
at
this
moment
was
causing
great
uneasiness
to
the
jury
of
the
sessions
before
whom
theodore
calvi
had
been
tried
for
a
whole
week
since
the
criminal
s
appeal
had
been
rejected
by
the
supreme
court
monsieur
de
granville
had
been
worrying
himself
over
the
case
and
postponing
from
day
to
day
the
order
for
carrying
out
the
sentence
so
anxious
was
he
to
reassure
the
jury
by
announcing
that
on
the
threshold
of
death
the
accused
had
confessed
the
crime
a
poor
widow
of
nanterre
whose
dwelling
stood
apart
from
the
township
which
is
situated
in
the
midst
of
the
infertile
plain
lying
between
the
hills
of
sartrouville
and
argenteuil
had
been
murdered
and
robbed
a
few
days
after
coming
into
her
share
of
an
unexpected
inheritance
this
windfall
amounted
to
three
thousand
francs
a
dozen
silver
spoons
and
forks
a
gold
watch
and
chain
and
some
linen
instead
of
depositing
the
three
thousand
francs
in
paris
as
she
was
advised
by
the
notary
of
the
who
had
left
it
her
the
old
woman
insisted
on
keeping
it
by
her
in
the
first
place
she
had
never
seen
so
much
money
of
her
own
and
then
she
distrusted
everybody
in
every
kind
of
affairs
as
most
common
and
country
folk
do
after
long
discussion
with
a
of
nanterre
a
relation
of
her
own
and
of
the
who
had
left
her
the
money
the
widow
decided
on
buying
an
annuity
on
selling
her
house
at
nanterre
and
living
in
the
town
of
the
house
she
was
living
in
with
a
garden
enclosed
by
a
slight
wooden
fence
was
the
poor
sort
of
dwelling
usually
built
by
small
landowners
in
the
neighborhood
of
paris
it
had
been
hastily
constructed
with
no
architectural
design
of
cement
and
rubble
the
materials
commonly
used
near
paris
where
as
at
nanterre
they
are
extremely
abundant
the
ground
being
everywhere
broken
by
quarries
open
to
the
sky
this
is
the
ordinary
hut
of
the
civilized
savage
the
house
consisted
of
a
ground
floor
and
one
floor
above
with
garrets
in
the
roof
the
quarryman
her
deceased
husband
and
the
builder
of
this
dwelling
had
put
strong
iron
bars
to
all
the
windows
the
front
door
was
remarkably
thick
the
man
knew
that
he
was
alone
there
in
the
open
country
and
what
a
country
his
customers
were
the
principal
in
paris
so
the
more
important
materials
for
his
house
which
stood
within
five
hundred
yards
of
his
quarry
had
been
brought
out
in
his
own
carts
returning
empty
he
could
choose
such
as
suited
him
where
houses
were
pulled
down
and
got
them
very
cheap
thus
the
window
frames
the
the
doors
shutters
and
wooden
fittings
were
all
derived
from
sanctioned
pilfering
presents
from
his
customers
and
good
ones
carefully
chosen
of
two
he
could
take
the
better
the
house
entered
from
a
large
was
screened
from
the
road
by
a
wall
the
gate
was
of
strong
were
kept
in
the
stables
and
a
little
dog
indoors
at
night
there
was
a
garden
of
more
than
two
acres
behind
his
widow
without
children
lived
here
with
only
a
woman
servant
the
sale
of
the
quarry
had
paid
off
the
owner
s
debts
he
had
been
dead
about
two
years
this
isolated
house
was
the
widow
s
sole
possession
and
she
kept
fowls
and
cows
selling
the
eggs
and
milk
at
nanterre
having
no
stableboy
or
carter
or
quarryman
her
husband
had
made
them
do
every
kind
of
work
she
no
longer
kept
up
the
garden
she
only
gathered
the
few
greens
and
roots
that
the
stony
ground
allowed
to
grow
the
price
of
the
house
with
the
money
she
had
inherited
would
amount
to
seven
or
eight
thousand
francs
and
she
could
fancy
herself
living
very
happily
at
on
seven
or
eight
hundred
francs
a
year
which
she
thought
she
could
buy
with
her
eight
thousand
francs
she
had
had
many
discussions
over
this
with
the
notary
at
for
she
refused
to
hand
her
money
over
for
an
annuity
to
the
at
nanterre
who
was
anxious
to
have
it
under
these
circumstances
then
after
a
certain
day
the
widow
pigeau
and
her
servant
were
seen
no
more
the
front
gate
the
house
door
the
shutters
all
were
closed
at
the
end
of
three
days
the
police
being
informed
made
inquisition
monsieur
popinot
the
examining
judge
and
the
public
prosecutor
arrived
from
paris
and
this
was
what
they
reported
neither
the
outer
gate
nor
the
front
door
showed
any
marks
of
violence
the
key
was
in
the
lock
of
the
door
inside
not
a
single
bar
had
been
wretched
the
locks
shutters
and
bolts
were
all
untampered
with
the
walls
showed
no
traces
that
could
betray
the
passage
of
the
criminals
the
of
red
clay
afforded
no
opportunity
for
ingress
or
escape
and
the
roofing
was
sound
and
unbroken
showing
no
damage
by
violence
on
entering
the
rooms
the
magistrates
the
gendarmes
and
found
the
widow
pigeau
strangled
in
her
bed
and
the
woman
strangled
in
hers
each
by
means
of
the
bandana
she
wore
as
a
nightcap
the
three
thousand
francs
were
gone
with
the
and
the
trinkets
the
two
bodies
were
decomposing
as
were
those
of
the
little
dog
and
of
a
large
the
wooden
palings
of
the
garden
were
examined
none
were
broken
the
garden
paths
showed
no
trace
of
footsteps
the
magistrate
thought
it
probable
that
the
robber
had
walked
on
the
grass
to
leave
no
if
he
had
come
that
way
but
how
could
he
have
got
into
the
house
the
back
door
to
the
garden
had
an
outer
guard
of
three
iron
bars
uninjured
and
there
too
the
key
was
in
the
lock
inside
as
in
the
front
door
all
these
impossibilities
having
been
duly
noted
by
monsieur
popinot
by
who
stayed
there
a
day
to
examine
every
detail
by
the
public
prosecutor
himself
and
by
the
sergeant
of
the
gendarmerie
at
nanterre
this
murder
became
an
agitating
mystery
in
which
the
law
and
the
police
were
nonplussed
this
drama
published
in
the
des
took
place
in
the
winter
of
god
alone
knows
what
excitement
this
puzzling
crime
occasioned
in
paris
but
paris
has
a
new
drama
to
watch
every
morning
and
forgets
everything
the
police
on
the
contrary
forgets
nothing
three
months
after
this
fruitless
inquiry
a
girl
of
the
town
whose
extravagance
had
invited
the
attention
of
s
agents
who
watched
her
as
being
the
ally
of
several
thieves
tried
to
persuade
a
woman
she
knew
to
pledge
twelve
silver
spoons
and
forks
and
a
gold
watch
and
chain
the
friend
refused
this
came
to
s
ears
and
he
remembered
the
plate
and
the
watch
and
chain
stolen
at
nanterre
the
commissioners
of
the
and
all
the
receivers
of
stolen
goods
were
warned
while
manon
la
blonde
was
subjected
to
unremitting
scrutiny
it
was
very
soon
discovered
that
manon
la
blonde
was
madly
in
love
with
a
young
man
who
was
never
to
be
seen
and
was
supposed
to
be
deaf
to
all
the
fair
manon
s
proofs
of
devotion
mystery
on
mystery
however
this
youth
under
the
diligent
attentions
of
police
spies
was
soon
seen
and
identified
as
an
escaped
convict
the
famous
hero
of
the
corsican
vendetta
the
handsome
theodore
calvi
known
as
madeleine
a
man
was
turned
on
to
entrap
calvi
one
of
those
buyers
of
stolen
goods
who
serve
the
thieves
and
the
police
both
at
once
he
promised
to
purchase
the
silver
and
the
watch
and
chain
at
the
moment
when
the
dealer
of
the
cour
was
counting
out
the
cash
to
theodore
dressed
as
a
woman
at
six
in
the
evening
the
police
came
in
and
seized
theodore
and
the
property
the
inquiry
was
at
once
begun
on
such
thin
evidence
it
was
impossible
to
pass
a
sentence
of
death
calvi
never
swerved
he
never
contradicted
himself
he
said
that
a
country
woman
had
sold
him
these
objects
at
argenteuil
that
after
buying
them
the
excitement
over
the
murder
committed
at
nanterre
had
shown
him
the
danger
of
keeping
this
plate
and
watch
and
chain
in
his
possession
since
in
fact
they
were
proved
by
the
inventory
made
after
the
death
of
the
wine
merchant
the
widow
pigeau
s
uncle
to
be
those
that
were
stolen
from
her
compelled
at
last
by
poverty
to
sell
them
he
said
he
wished
to
dispose
of
them
by
the
intervention
of
a
person
to
whom
no
suspicion
could
attach
and
nothing
else
could
be
extracted
from
the
convict
who
by
his
taciturnity
and
firmness
contrived
to
insinuate
that
the
at
nanterre
had
committed
the
crime
and
that
the
woman
of
whom
he
theodore
had
bought
them
was
the
s
wife
the
unhappy
man
and
his
wife
were
both
taken
into
custody
but
after
a
week
s
imprisonment
it
was
amply
proved
that
neither
the
husband
nor
the
wife
had
been
out
of
their
house
at
the
time
also
calvi
failed
to
recognize
in
the
wife
the
woman
who
as
he
declared
had
sold
him
the
things
as
it
was
shown
that
calvi
s
mistress
implicated
in
the
case
had
spent
about
a
thousand
francs
since
the
date
of
the
crime
and
the
day
when
calvi
tried
to
pledge
the
plate
and
trinkets
the
evidence
seemed
strong
enough
to
commit
calvi
and
the
girl
for
trial
this
murder
being
the
eighteenth
which
theodore
had
committed
he
was
condemned
to
death
for
he
seemed
certainly
to
be
guilty
of
this
skilfully
contrived
crime
though
he
did
not
recognize
the
s
wife
both
she
and
her
husband
recognized
him
the
inquiry
had
proved
by
the
evidence
of
several
witnesses
that
theodore
had
been
living
at
nanterre
for
about
a
month
he
had
worked
at
a
mason
s
his
face
whitened
with
plaster
and
his
clothes
very
shabby
at
nanterre
the
lad
was
supposed
to
be
about
eighteen
years
old
for
the
whole
month
he
must
have
been
nursing
that
brat
nourri
ce
poupon
hatching
the
crime
the
lawyers
thought
he
must
have
had
accomplices
the
were
measured
and
compared
with
the
size
of
manon
la
blonde
s
body
to
see
if
she
could
have
got
in
that
way
but
a
child
of
six
could
not
have
passed
up
or
down
those
pipes
which
in
modern
buildings
take
the
place
of
the
vast
chimneys
of
houses
but
for
this
singular
and
annoying
difficulty
theodore
would
have
been
executed
within
a
week
the
prison
chaplain
it
has
been
seen
could
make
nothing
of
him
all
this
business
and
the
name
of
calvi
must
have
escaped
the
notice
of
jacques
collin
who
at
the
time
was
absorbed
in
his
struggle
with
contenson
corentin
and
peyrade
it
had
indeed
been
a
point
with
to
forget
as
far
as
possible
his
chums
and
all
that
had
to
do
with
the
law
courts
he
dreaded
a
meeting
which
should
bring
him
face
to
face
with
a
pal
who
might
demand
an
account
of
his
boss
which
collin
could
not
possibly
render
the
governor
of
the
prison
went
forthwith
to
the
public
prosecutor
s
court
where
he
found
the
in
conversation
with
monsieur
de
granville
who
had
spent
the
whole
night
at
the
hotel
de
serizy
was
in
consequence
of
this
important
case
obliged
to
give
a
few
hours
to
his
duties
though
overwhelmed
with
fatigue
and
grief
for
the
physicians
could
not
yet
promise
that
the
countess
would
recover
her
sanity
after
speaking
a
few
words
to
the
governor
monsieur
de
granville
took
the
warrant
from
the
attorney
and
placed
it
in
gault
s
hands
let
the
matter
proceed
said
he
unless
some
extraordinary
circumstances
should
arise
of
this
you
must
judge
i
trust
to
your
judgment
the
scaffold
need
not
be
erected
till
ten
so
you
still
have
an
hour
on
such
an
occasion
hours
are
centuries
and
many
things
may
happen
in
a
century
do
not
allow
him
to
think
he
is
reprieved
prepare
the
man
for
execution
if
necessary
and
if
nothing
comes
of
that
give
sanson
the
warrant
at
nine
let
him
wait
as
the
governor
of
the
prison
left
the
public
prosecutor
s
room
under
the
archway
of
the
passage
into
the
hall
he
met
monsieur
camusot
who
was
going
there
he
exchanged
a
few
hurried
words
with
the
examining
judge
and
after
telling
him
what
had
been
done
at
the
conciergerie
with
regard
to
jacques
collin
he
went
on
to
witness
the
meeting
of
and
madeleine
and
he
did
not
allow
the
priest
to
see
the
condemned
criminal
till
admirably
disguised
as
a
gendarme
had
taken
the
place
of
the
prisoner
left
in
charge
of
the
young
corsican
no
words
can
describe
the
amazement
of
the
three
convicts
when
a
warder
came
to
fetch
jacques
collin
and
led
him
to
the
condemned
cell
with
one
consent
they
rushed
up
to
the
chair
on
which
jacques
collin
was
sitting
isn
t
it
monsieur
asked
of
the
warder
yes
jack
ketch
is
waiting
said
the
man
with
perfect
indifference
charlot
is
the
name
by
which
the
executioner
is
known
to
the
populace
and
the
prison
world
in
paris
the
nickname
dates
from
the
revolution
of
the
words
produced
a
great
sensation
the
prisoners
looked
at
each
other
it
is
all
over
with
him
the
warder
went
on
the
warrant
has
been
delivered
to
monsieur
gault
and
the
sentence
has
just
been
read
to
and
so
the
fair
madeleine
has
received
the
last
sacraments
said
la
pouraille
and
he
swallowed
a
deep
mouthful
of
air
poor
little
theodore
cried
le
biffon
he
is
a
pretty
chap
too
what
a
pity
to
drop
your
nut
eternuer
dans
le
son
so
the
warder
went
towards
the
gate
thinking
that
jacques
collin
was
at
his
heels
but
the
spaniard
walked
very
slowly
and
when
he
was
getting
near
to
julien
he
tottered
and
signed
to
la
pouraille
to
give
him
his
arm
he
is
a
murderer
said
napolitas
to
the
priest
pointing
to
la
pouraille
and
offering
his
own
arm
no
to
me
he
is
an
unhappy
wretch
replied
jacques
collin
with
the
presence
of
mind
and
the
unction
of
the
archbishop
of
cambrai
and
he
drew
away
from
napolitas
of
whom
he
had
been
very
suspicious
from
the
first
then
he
said
to
his
pals
in
an
undertone
he
is
on
the
bottom
step
of
the
abbaye
de
but
i
am
the
prior
i
will
show
you
how
well
i
know
how
to
come
round
the
beaks
i
mean
to
snatch
this
boy
s
nut
from
their
for
the
sake
of
his
breeches
said
with
a
smile
i
mean
to
win
his
soul
to
heaven
replied
jacques
collin
fervently
seeing
some
other
prisoners
about
him
and
he
joined
the
warder
at
the
gate
he
got
in
to
save
madeleine
said
we
guessed
rightly
what
a
boss
he
is
but
how
can
he
jack
ketch
s
men
are
waiting
he
will
not
even
see
the
kid
objected
le
biffon
the
devil
is
on
his
side
cried
la
pouraille
he
claim
our
blunt
never
he
is
too
fond
of
his
old
chums
we
are
too
useful
to
him
they
wanted
to
make
us
blow
the
gaff
but
we
are
not
such
flats
if
he
saves
his
madeleine
i
will
tell
him
all
my
the
effect
of
this
speech
was
to
increase
the
devotion
of
the
three
convicts
to
their
boss
for
at
this
moment
he
was
all
their
hope
jacques
collin
in
spite
of
madeleine
s
peril
did
not
forget
to
play
his
part
though
he
knew
the
conciergerie
as
well
as
he
knew
the
hulks
in
the
three
ports
he
blundered
so
naturally
that
the
warder
had
to
tell
him
this
way
that
way
till
they
reached
the
office
there
at
a
glance
jacques
collin
recognized
a
tall
stout
man
leaning
on
the
stove
with
a
long
red
face
not
without
distinction
it
was
sanson
monsieur
is
the
chaplain
said
he
going
towards
him
with
simple
cordiality
the
mistake
was
so
shocking
that
it
froze
the
bystanders
no
monsieur
said
sanson
i
have
other
sanson
the
father
of
the
last
executioner
of
that
name
for
he
has
recently
been
dismissed
was
the
son
of
the
man
who
beheaded
louis
xvi
after
four
centuries
of
hereditary
office
this
descendant
of
so
many
executioners
had
tried
to
repudiate
the
traditional
burden
the
sansons
were
for
two
hundred
years
executioners
at
rouen
before
being
promoted
to
the
first
rank
in
the
kingdom
and
had
carried
out
the
decrees
of
justice
from
father
to
son
since
the
thirteenth
century
few
families
can
boast
of
an
office
or
of
nobility
handed
down
in
a
direct
line
during
six
centuries
this
young
man
had
been
captain
in
a
cavalry
regiment
and
was
looking
forward
to
a
brilliant
military
career
when
his
father
insisted
on
his
help
in
decapitating
the
king
then
he
made
his
son
his
deputy
when
in
two
guillotines
were
in
constant
work
one
at
the
barriere
du
trone
and
the
other
in
the
place
de
greve
this
terrible
functionary
now
a
man
of
about
sixty
was
remarkable
for
his
dignified
air
his
gentle
and
deliberate
manners
and
his
entire
contempt
for
and
his
acolytes
who
fed
the
machine
the
only
detail
which
betrayed
the
blood
of
the
mediaeval
executioner
was
the
formidable
breadth
and
thickness
of
his
hands
well
informed
too
caring
greatly
for
his
position
as
a
citizen
and
an
elector
and
an
enthusiastic
florist
this
tall
brawny
man
with
his
low
voice
his
calm
reserve
his
few
words
and
a
high
bald
forehead
was
like
an
english
nobleman
rather
than
an
executioner
and
a
spanish
priest
would
certainly
have
fallen
into
the
mistake
which
jacques
collin
had
intentionally
made
he
is
no
convict
said
the
head
warder
to
the
governor
i
begin
to
think
so
too
replied
monsieur
gault
with
a
nod
to
that
official
jacques
collin
was
led
to
the
room
where
theodore
calvi
in
a
straitwaistcoat
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
wretched
camp
bed
under
a
transient
gleam
of
light
from
the
passage
at
once
recognized
in
the
gendarme
who
stood
leaning
on
his
sword
io
sono
parla
nostro
italiano
said
jacques
collin
very
rapidly
vengo
ti
i
am
talk
our
italian
i
have
come
to
save
all
the
two
chums
wanted
to
say
had
of
course
to
be
incomprehensible
to
the
pretended
gendarme
and
as
was
left
in
charge
of
the
prisoner
he
could
not
leave
his
post
the
man
s
fury
was
quite
indescribable
theodore
calvi
a
young
man
with
a
pale
olive
complexion
light
hair
and
hollow
dull
blue
eyes
well
built
hiding
prodigious
strength
under
the
lymphatic
appearance
that
is
not
uncommon
in
southerners
would
have
had
a
charming
face
but
for
the
eyebrows
and
low
forehead
that
gave
him
a
sinister
expression
scarlet
lips
of
savage
cruelty
and
a
twitching
of
the
muscles
peculiar
to
corsicans
denoting
that
excessive
irritability
which
makes
them
so
prompt
to
kill
in
any
sudden
squabble
theodore
startled
at
the
sound
of
that
voice
raised
his
head
and
at
first
thought
himself
the
victim
of
a
delusion
but
as
the
experience
of
two
months
had
accustomed
him
to
the
darkness
of
this
stone
box
he
looked
at
the
sham
priest
and
sighed
deeply
he
did
not
recognize
jacques
collin
whose
face
scarred
by
the
application
of
sulphuric
acid
was
not
that
of
his
old
boss
it
is
really
your
jacques
i
am
your
confessor
and
have
come
to
get
you
off
do
not
be
such
a
ninny
as
to
know
me
and
speak
as
if
you
were
making
a
he
spoke
with
the
utmost
rapidity
this
young
fellow
is
very
much
depressed
he
is
afraid
to
die
he
will
confess
everything
said
jacques
collin
addressing
the
gendarme
dared
not
say
a
word
for
fear
of
being
recognized
say
something
to
show
me
that
you
are
he
you
have
nothing
but
his
voice
said
theodore
you
see
poor
boy
he
assures
me
that
he
is
innocent
said
jacques
collin
to
who
dared
not
speak
for
fear
of
being
recognized
sempre
mi
said
jacques
returning
close
to
theodore
and
speaking
the
word
in
his
ear
sempre
ti
replied
theodore
giving
the
countersign
yes
you
are
the
boss
did
you
do
the
trick
tell
me
the
whole
story
that
i
may
see
what
can
be
done
to
save
you
make
haste
jack
ketch
is
the
corsican
at
once
knelt
down
and
pretended
to
be
about
to
confess
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
the
conversation
was
so
rapid
that
it
hardly
took
as
much
time
as
it
does
to
read
it
theodore
hastily
told
all
the
details
of
the
crime
of
which
jacques
collin
knew
nothing
the
jury
gave
their
verdict
without
proof
he
said
finally
child
you
want
to
argue
when
they
are
waiting
to
cut
off
your
hair
but
i
might
have
been
sent
to
spout
the
and
that
is
the
way
they
judge
you
and
in
paris
too
but
how
did
you
do
the
job
asked
ah
there
you
since
i
saw
you
i
made
acquaintance
with
a
girl
a
corsican
i
met
when
i
came
to
men
who
are
such
fools
as
to
love
a
woman
cried
jacques
collin
always
come
to
grief
that
way
they
are
tigers
on
the
loose
tigers
who
blab
and
look
at
themselves
in
the
you
were
a
but
well
what
good
did
she
do
you
that
curse
of
a
moll
that
duck
of
a
girl
no
taller
than
a
bundle
of
firewood
as
slippery
as
an
eel
and
as
nimble
as
a
monkey
got
in
at
the
top
of
the
oven
and
opened
the
front
door
the
dogs
were
well
crammed
with
balls
and
as
dead
as
herrings
i
settled
the
two
women
then
when
i
got
the
swag
ginetta
locked
the
door
and
got
out
again
by
the
such
a
clever
dodge
deserves
life
said
jacques
collin
admiring
the
execution
of
the
crime
as
a
sculptor
admires
the
modeling
of
a
figure
and
i
was
fool
enough
to
waste
all
that
cleverness
for
a
thousand
crowns
no
for
a
woman
replied
jacques
collin
i
tell
you
they
deprive
us
of
all
our
wits
and
jacques
collin
eyed
theodore
with
a
flashing
glance
of
contempt
but
you
were
not
there
said
the
corsican
i
was
all
alone
and
do
you
love
the
slut
asked
jacques
collin
feeling
that
the
reproach
was
a
just
one
oh
i
want
to
live
but
it
is
for
you
now
rather
than
for
be
quite
easy
i
am
not
called
for
nothing
i
undertake
the
what
life
cried
the
lad
lifting
his
swaddled
hands
towards
the
damp
vault
of
the
cell
my
little
madeleine
prepare
to
be
lagged
for
life
penal
servitude
replied
jacques
collin
you
can
expect
no
less
they
won
t
crown
you
with
roses
like
a
fatted
ox
when
they
first
set
us
down
for
rochefort
it
was
because
they
wanted
to
be
rid
of
us
but
if
i
can
get
you
ticketed
for
toulon
you
can
get
out
and
come
back
to
pantin
paris
where
i
will
find
you
a
tidy
way
of
a
sigh
such
as
had
rarely
been
heard
under
that
inexorable
roof
struck
the
stones
which
sent
back
the
sound
that
has
no
fellow
in
music
to
the
ear
of
the
astounded
it
is
the
effect
of
the
absolution
i
promised
him
in
return
for
his
revelations
said
jacques
collin
to
the
gendarme
these
corsicans
monsieur
are
full
of
faith
but
he
is
as
innocent
as
the
immaculate
babe
and
i
mean
to
try
to
save
god
bless
you
monsieur
l
abbe
said
theodore
in
french
more
carlos
herrera
more
the
canon
than
ever
left
the
condemned
cell
rushed
back
to
the
hall
and
appeared
before
monsieur
gault
in
affected
horror
indeed
sir
the
young
man
is
innocent
he
has
told
me
who
the
guilty
person
is
he
was
ready
to
die
for
a
false
point
of
honor
he
is
a
corsican
go
and
beg
the
public
prosecutor
to
grant
me
five
minutes
interview
monsieur
de
granville
can
not
refuse
to
listen
at
once
to
a
spanish
priest
who
is
suffering
so
cruelly
from
the
blunders
of
the
french
i
will
go
said
monsieur
gault
to
the
extreme
astonishment
of
all
the
witnesses
of
this
extraordinary
scene
and
meanwhile
said
jacques
send
me
back
to
the
where
i
may
finish
the
conversion
of
a
criminal
whose
heart
i
have
touched
already
they
have
hearts
these
people
this
speech
produced
a
sensation
in
all
who
heard
it
the
gendarmes
the
registry
clerk
sanson
the
warders
the
executioner
s
assistant
all
awaiting
orders
to
go
and
get
the
scaffold
ready
to
rig
up
the
machine
in
prison
slang
all
these
people
usually
so
indifferent
were
agitated
by
very
natural
curiosity
just
then
the
rattle
of
a
carriage
with
horses
was
heard
it
stopped
very
suggestively
at
the
gate
of
the
conciergerie
on
the
quay
the
door
was
opened
and
the
step
let
down
in
such
haste
that
every
one
supposed
that
some
great
personage
had
arrived
presently
a
lady
waving
a
sheet
of
blue
paper
came
forward
to
the
outer
gate
of
the
prison
followed
by
a
footman
and
a
chasseur
dressed
very
handsomely
and
all
in
black
with
a
veil
over
her
bonnet
she
was
wiping
her
eyes
with
a
floridly
embroidered
handkerchief
jacques
collin
at
once
recognized
asie
or
to
give
the
woman
her
true
name
jacqueline
collin
his
aunt
this
horrible
old
woman
worthy
of
her
nephew
whose
thoughts
were
all
centered
in
the
prisoner
and
who
was
defending
him
with
intelligence
and
that
were
a
match
for
the
powers
of
the
law
had
a
permit
made
out
the
evening
before
in
the
name
of
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
s
by
the
request
of
monsieur
de
serizy
allowing
her
to
see
lucien
de
rubempre
and
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
so
soon
as
he
should
be
brought
out
of
the
secret
cells
on
this
the
colonel
who
was
the
of
all
the
prisons
had
written
a
few
words
and
the
mere
color
of
the
paper
revealed
powerful
influences
for
these
permits
like
differ
in
shape
and
appearance
so
the
turnkey
hastened
to
open
the
gate
especially
when
he
saw
the
chasseur
with
his
plumes
and
an
uniform
of
green
and
gold
as
dazzling
as
a
russian
general
s
proclaiming
a
lady
of
aristocratic
rank
and
almost
royal
birth
oh
my
dear
abbe
exclaimed
this
fine
lady
shedding
a
torrent
of
tears
at
the
sight
of
the
priest
how
could
any
one
ever
think
of
putting
such
a
saintly
man
in
here
even
by
mistake
the
governor
took
the
permit
and
read
introduced
by
his
excellency
the
comte
de
ah
madame
de
madame
la
marquise
cried
carlos
herrera
what
admirable
devotion
but
madame
such
interviews
are
against
the
rules
said
the
good
old
governor
and
he
intercepted
the
advance
of
this
bale
of
black
and
lace
but
at
such
a
distance
said
jacques
collin
and
in
your
presence
and
he
looked
round
at
the
group
his
aunt
whose
dress
might
well
dazzle
the
clerk
the
governor
the
warders
and
the
gendarmes
stank
of
musk
she
had
on
besides
a
thousand
crowns
of
lace
a
black
india
cashmere
shawl
worth
six
thousand
francs
and
her
chasseur
was
marching
up
and
down
outside
with
the
insolence
of
a
lackey
who
knows
that
he
is
essential
to
an
exacting
princess
he
spoke
never
a
word
to
the
footman
who
stood
by
the
gate
on
the
quay
which
is
always
open
by
day
what
do
you
wish
what
can
i
do
said
madame
de
in
the
lingo
agreed
upon
by
this
aunt
and
nephew
this
dialect
consisted
in
adding
terminations
in
ar
or
in
or
or
in
al
or
in
i
to
every
word
whether
french
or
slang
so
as
to
disguise
it
by
lengthening
it
it
was
a
diplomatic
cipher
adapted
to
speech
put
all
the
letters
in
some
safe
place
take
out
those
that
are
most
likely
to
compromise
the
ladies
come
back
dressed
very
poorly
to
the
des
and
wait
for
my
asie
otherwise
jacqueline
knelt
as
if
to
receive
his
blessing
and
the
sham
priest
blessed
his
aunt
with
evengelical
unction
addio
marchesa
said
he
aloud
and
he
added
in
their
private
language
find
europe
and
paccard
with
the
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
they
bagged
we
must
have
paccard
is
out
there
said
the
pious
marquise
pointing
to
the
chasseur
her
eyes
full
of
tears
this
intuitive
comprehension
brought
not
merely
a
smile
to
the
man
s
lips
but
a
gesture
of
surprise
no
one
could
astonish
him
but
his
aunt
the
sham
marquise
turned
to
the
bystanders
with
the
air
of
a
woman
accustomed
to
give
herself
airs
he
is
in
despair
at
being
unable
to
attend
his
son
s
funeral
said
she
in
broken
french
for
this
monstrous
miscarriage
of
justice
has
betrayed
the
saintly
man
s
i
am
going
to
the
funeral
here
monsieur
she
added
to
the
governor
handing
him
a
purse
of
gold
this
is
to
give
your
poor
prisoners
some
what
style
her
nephew
whispered
in
approval
jacques
collin
then
followed
the
warder
who
led
him
back
to
the
yard
quite
desperate
had
at
last
caught
the
eye
of
a
real
gendarme
to
whom
since
jacques
collin
had
gone
he
had
been
addressing
significant
ahems
and
who
took
his
place
on
guard
in
the
condemned
cell
but
sworn
foe
was
released
too
late
to
see
the
great
lady
who
drove
off
in
her
dashing
and
whose
voice
though
disguised
fell
on
his
ear
with
a
vicious
twang
three
hundred
shiners
for
the
boarders
said
the
head
warder
showing
the
purse
which
monsieur
gault
had
handed
over
to
his
clerk
let
s
see
monsieur
jacomety
said
the
police
agent
took
the
purse
poured
out
the
money
into
his
hand
and
examined
it
curiously
yes
it
is
gold
sure
enough
said
he
and
a
on
the
purse
the
scoundrel
how
clever
he
is
what
an
villain
he
does
us
all
brown
and
all
the
time
he
ought
to
be
shot
down
like
a
dog
why
what
s
the
matter
asked
the
clerk
taking
back
the
money
the
matter
why
the
hussy
stole
it
cried
stamping
with
rage
on
the
flags
of
the
gateway
the
words
produced
a
great
sensation
among
the
spectators
who
were
standing
at
a
little
distance
from
monsieur
sanson
he
too
was
still
standing
his
back
against
the
large
stove
in
the
middle
of
the
vaulted
hall
awaiting
the
order
to
crop
the
felon
s
hair
and
erect
the
scaffold
on
the
place
de
greve
on
the
yard
jacques
collin
went
towards
his
chums
at
a
pace
suited
to
a
frequenter
of
the
galleys
what
have
you
on
your
mind
said
he
to
la
pouraille
my
game
is
up
said
the
man
whom
jacques
collin
led
into
a
corner
what
i
want
now
is
a
pal
i
can
what
for
la
pouraille
after
telling
the
tale
of
all
his
crimes
but
in
thieves
slang
gave
an
account
of
the
murder
and
robbery
of
the
two
crottats
you
have
my
respect
said
jacques
collin
the
job
was
well
done
but
you
seem
to
me
to
have
blundered
in
what
way
well
having
done
the
trick
you
ought
to
have
had
a
russian
passport
have
made
up
as
a
russian
prince
bought
a
fine
coach
with
a
on
it
have
boldly
deposited
your
money
in
a
bank
have
got
a
letter
of
credit
on
hamburg
and
then
have
set
out
posting
to
hamburg
with
a
valet
a
ladies
maid
and
your
mistress
disguised
as
a
russian
princess
at
hamburg
you
should
have
sailed
for
mexico
a
chap
of
spirit
with
two
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
francs
in
gold
ought
to
be
able
to
do
what
he
pleases
and
go
where
he
pleases
flathead
oh
yes
you
have
such
notions
because
you
are
the
boss
your
nut
is
always
square
on
your
shoulders
but
i
in
short
a
word
of
good
advice
in
your
position
is
like
broth
to
a
dead
man
said
jacques
collin
with
a
serpentlike
gaze
at
his
old
pal
true
enough
said
la
pouraille
looking
dubious
but
give
me
the
broth
all
the
same
if
it
does
not
suit
my
stomach
i
can
warm
my
feet
in
it
here
you
are
nabbed
by
the
justice
with
five
robberies
and
three
murders
the
latest
of
them
those
of
two
rich
and
respectable
folks
now
juries
do
not
like
to
see
respectable
folks
killed
you
will
be
put
through
the
machine
and
there
is
not
a
chance
for
i
have
heard
all
that
said
la
pouraille
lamentably
my
aunt
jacqueline
with
whom
i
have
just
exchanged
a
few
words
in
the
office
and
who
is
as
you
know
a
mother
to
the
pals
told
me
that
the
authorities
mean
to
be
quit
of
you
they
are
so
much
afraid
of
but
i
am
rich
now
said
la
pouraille
with
a
simplicity
which
showed
how
convinced
a
thief
is
of
his
natural
right
to
steal
what
are
they
afraid
of
we
have
no
time
for
philosophizing
said
jacques
collin
to
come
back
to
you
what
do
you
want
with
me
said
la
pouraille
interrupting
his
boss
you
shall
see
a
dead
dog
is
still
worth
to
other
people
said
la
pouraille
i
take
you
into
my
game
said
jacques
collin
well
that
is
something
said
the
murderer
what
next
i
do
not
ask
you
where
your
money
is
but
what
you
mean
to
do
with
it
la
pouraille
looked
into
the
convict
s
impenetrable
eye
and
jacques
coldly
went
on
have
you
a
trip
you
are
sweet
upon
or
a
child
or
a
pal
to
be
helped
i
shall
be
outside
within
an
hour
and
i
can
do
much
for
any
one
you
want
to
be
la
pouraille
still
hesitated
he
was
delaying
with
indecision
jacques
collin
produced
a
clinching
argument
your
whack
of
our
money
would
be
thirty
thousand
francs
do
you
leave
it
to
the
pals
do
you
bequeath
it
to
anybody
your
share
is
safe
i
can
give
it
this
evening
to
any
one
you
leave
it
the
murderer
gave
a
little
start
of
satisfaction
i
have
him
said
jacques
collin
to
himself
but
we
have
no
time
to
play
consider
he
went
on
in
la
pouraille
s
ear
we
have
not
ten
minutes
to
spare
old
chap
the
public
prosecutor
is
to
send
for
me
and
i
am
to
have
a
talk
with
him
i
have
him
safe
and
can
ring
the
old
boss
neck
i
am
certain
i
shall
save
if
you
save
madeleine
my
good
boss
you
can
just
as
easily
don
t
waste
your
spittle
said
jacques
collin
shortly
make
your
well
then
i
want
to
leave
the
money
to
la
gonore
replied
la
pouraille
piteously
what
are
you
living
with
moses
widow
the
jew
who
led
the
swindling
gang
in
the
south
asked
jacques
collin
for
like
a
great
general
knew
the
person
of
every
one
of
his
army
that
s
the
woman
said
la
pouraille
much
flattered
a
pretty
woman
said
jacques
collin
who
knew
exactly
how
to
manage
his
dreadful
tools
the
moll
is
a
beauty
she
is
well
informed
and
stands
by
her
mates
and
a
hand
yes
la
gonore
has
made
a
new
man
of
you
what
a
flat
you
must
be
to
risk
your
nut
when
you
have
a
trip
like
her
at
home
you
noodle
you
should
have
set
up
some
respectable
little
shop
and
lived
and
what
does
she
do
she
is
settled
in
the
rue
managing
a
house
and
she
is
to
be
your
legatee
ah
my
dear
boy
this
is
what
such
sluts
bring
us
to
when
we
are
such
fools
as
to
love
yes
but
don
t
you
give
her
anything
till
i
am
done
it
is
a
sacred
trust
said
jacques
collin
very
seriously
and
nothing
to
the
pals
nothing
they
blowed
the
gaff
for
me
answered
la
pouraille
vindictively
who
did
shall
i
serve
em
out
asked
jacques
collin
eagerly
trying
to
rouse
the
last
sentiment
that
survives
in
these
souls
till
the
last
hour
who
knows
old
pal
but
i
might
at
the
same
time
do
them
a
bad
turn
and
serve
you
with
the
public
prosecutor
the
murderer
looked
at
his
boss
with
amazed
satisfaction
at
this
moment
the
boss
replied
to
this
expressive
look
i
am
playing
the
game
only
for
theodore
when
this
farce
is
played
out
old
boy
i
might
do
wonders
for
a
chum
for
you
are
a
chum
of
if
i
see
that
you
really
can
put
off
the
engagement
for
that
poor
little
theodore
i
will
do
anything
you
choose
there
but
the
trick
is
done
i
am
sure
to
save
his
head
if
you
want
to
get
out
of
the
scrape
you
see
la
pouraille
you
must
be
ready
to
do
a
good
turn
we
can
do
nothing
that
s
true
said
the
felon
his
confidence
was
so
strong
and
his
faith
in
the
boss
so
fanatical
that
he
no
longer
hesitated
la
pouraille
revealed
the
names
of
his
accomplices
a
secret
hitherto
well
kept
this
was
all
jacques
needed
to
know
that
is
the
whole
story
ruffard
was
the
third
in
the
job
with
me
and
godet
cried
jacques
collin
giving
ruffard
his
nickname
among
the
gang
that
s
the
and
the
blackguards
peached
because
i
knew
where
they
had
hidden
their
whack
and
they
did
not
know
where
mine
you
are
making
it
all
easy
my
cherub
said
jacques
collin
what
well
replied
the
master
you
see
how
wise
it
is
to
trust
me
entirely
your
revenge
is
now
part
of
the
hand
i
am
i
do
not
ask
you
to
tell
me
where
the
dibs
are
you
can
tell
me
at
the
last
moment
but
tell
me
all
about
ruffard
and
you
are
and
you
always
will
be
our
boss
i
have
no
secrets
from
you
replied
la
pouraille
my
money
is
in
the
cellar
at
la
gonore
and
you
are
not
afraid
of
her
telling
why
get
along
she
knows
nothing
about
my
little
game
replied
la
pouraille
i
make
her
drunk
though
she
is
of
the
sort
that
would
never
blab
even
with
her
head
under
the
but
such
a
lot
of
gold
yes
that
turns
the
milk
of
the
purest
conscience
replied
jacques
collin
so
i
could
do
the
job
with
no
peepers
to
spy
me
all
the
chickens
were
gone
to
roost
the
shiners
are
three
feet
underground
behind
some
and
i
spread
some
stones
and
mortar
over
good
said
jacques
collin
and
the
others
ruffard
s
pieces
are
with
la
gonore
in
the
poor
woman
s
bedroom
and
he
has
her
tight
by
that
for
she
might
be
nabbed
as
accessory
after
the
fact
and
end
her
days
in
the
villain
the
reelers
teach
a
thief
what
s
what
said
jacques
godet
left
his
pieces
at
his
sister
s
a
washerwoman
honest
girl
she
may
be
caught
for
five
years
in
la
force
without
dreaming
of
it
the
pal
raised
the
tiles
of
the
floor
put
them
back
again
and
now
do
you
know
what
i
want
you
to
do
said
jacques
collin
with
a
magnetizing
gaze
at
la
pouraille
what
i
want
you
to
take
madeleine
s
job
on
your
la
pouraille
started
queerly
but
he
at
once
recovered
himself
and
stood
at
attention
under
the
boss
eye
so
you
shy
at
that
you
dare
to
spoil
my
game
come
now
four
murders
or
three
does
it
not
come
to
the
same
thing
by
the
god
of
there
is
no
blood
in
your
veins
and
i
was
thinking
of
saving
you
how
idiot
if
we
promise
to
give
the
money
back
to
the
family
you
will
only
be
lagged
for
life
i
would
not
give
a
piece
for
your
nut
if
we
keep
the
blunt
but
at
this
moment
you
are
worth
seven
hundred
thousand
francs
you
good
for
you
boss
cried
la
pouraille
in
great
glee
and
then
said
jacques
collin
besides
casting
all
the
murders
on
ruffard
will
be
finely
cold
i
have
him
this
la
pouraille
was
speechless
at
this
suggestion
his
eyes
grew
round
and
he
stood
like
an
image
he
had
been
three
months
in
custody
and
was
committed
for
trial
and
his
chums
at
la
force
to
whom
he
had
never
mentioned
his
accomplices
had
given
him
such
small
comfort
that
he
was
entirely
hopeless
after
his
examination
and
this
simple
expedient
had
been
quite
overlooked
by
these
minds
this
semblance
of
a
hope
almost
stupefied
his
brain
have
ruffard
and
godet
had
their
spree
yet
have
they
forked
out
any
of
the
yellow
boys
asked
jacques
collin
they
dare
not
replied
la
pouraille
the
wretches
are
waiting
till
i
am
turned
off
that
is
what
my
moll
sent
me
word
by
la
biffe
when
she
came
to
see
le
very
well
we
will
have
their
whack
of
money
in
hours
said
jacques
collin
then
the
blackguards
can
not
pay
up
as
you
will
you
will
come
out
as
white
as
snow
and
they
will
be
red
with
all
that
blood
by
my
kind
offices
you
will
seem
a
good
sort
of
fellow
led
away
by
them
i
shall
have
money
enough
of
yours
to
prove
alibis
on
the
other
counts
and
when
you
are
back
on
the
hulks
for
you
are
bound
to
go
there
you
must
see
about
escaping
it
is
a
dog
s
life
still
it
is
life
la
pouraille
s
eyes
glittered
with
suppressed
delirium
with
seven
hundred
thousand
francs
you
can
get
a
good
many
drinks
said
jacques
collin
making
his
pal
quite
drunk
with
hope
ay
ay
boss
i
can
bamboozle
the
minister
of
ah
ha
ruffard
will
shell
out
to
do
for
a
reeler
is
fairly
gulled
very
good
it
is
a
bargain
said
la
pouraille
with
savage
glee
you
order
and
i
and
he
hugged
jacques
collin
in
his
arms
while
tears
of
joy
stood
in
his
eyes
so
hopeful
did
he
feel
of
saving
his
head
that
is
not
all
said
jacques
collin
the
public
prosecutor
does
not
swallow
everything
you
know
especially
when
a
new
count
is
entered
against
you
the
next
thing
is
to
bring
a
moll
into
the
case
by
blowing
the
but
how
and
what
for
do
as
i
bid
you
you
will
and
briefly
told
the
secret
of
the
nanterre
murders
showing
him
how
necessary
it
was
to
find
a
woman
who
would
pretend
to
be
ginetta
then
he
and
la
pouraille
now
in
good
spirits
went
across
to
le
biffon
i
know
how
sweet
you
are
on
la
biffe
said
jacques
collin
to
this
man
the
expression
in
le
biffon
s
eyes
was
a
horrible
poem
what
will
she
do
while
you
are
on
the
hulks
a
tear
sparkled
in
le
biffon
s
fierce
eyes
well
suppose
i
were
to
get
her
lodgings
in
the
lorcefe
des
largues
the
women
s
la
force
les
madelonnettes
or
for
a
stretch
allowing
that
time
for
you
to
be
sentenced
and
sent
there
to
arrive
and
to
escape
even
you
can
not
work
such
a
miracle
she
took
no
part
in
the
job
replied
la
biffe
s
partner
oh
my
good
biffon
said
la
pouraille
our
boss
is
more
powerful
than
god
what
is
your
password
for
her
asked
jacques
collin
with
the
assurance
of
a
master
to
whom
nothing
can
be
refused
sorgue
a
pantin
night
in
paris
if
you
say
that
she
knows
you
have
come
from
me
and
if
you
want
her
to
do
as
you
bid
her
show
her
a
piece
and
say
she
will
be
involved
in
the
sentence
on
la
pouraille
and
let
off
with
a
year
in
quod
for
snitching
said
jacques
collin
looking
at
la
pouraille
la
pouraille
understood
his
boss
scheme
and
by
a
single
look
promised
to
persuade
le
biffon
to
promote
it
by
inducing
la
biffe
to
take
upon
herself
this
complicity
in
the
crime
la
pouraille
was
prepared
to
confess
farewell
my
children
you
will
presently
hear
that
i
have
saved
my
boy
from
jack
ketch
said
yes
jack
ketch
and
his
hairdresser
were
waiting
in
the
office
to
get
madeleine
there
he
added
they
have
come
to
fetch
me
to
go
to
the
public
and
in
fact
a
warder
came
out
of
the
gate
and
beckoned
to
this
extraordinary
man
who
in
face
of
the
young
corsican
s
danger
had
recovered
his
own
against
his
own
society
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
at
the
moment
when
lucien
s
body
was
taken
away
from
him
jacques
collin
had
with
a
crowning
effort
made
up
his
mind
to
attempt
a
last
incarnation
not
as
a
human
being
but
as
a
he
had
at
last
taken
the
fateful
step
that
napoleon
took
on
board
the
boat
which
conveyed
him
to
the
bellerophon
and
a
strange
concurrence
of
events
aided
this
genius
of
evil
and
corruption
in
his
undertaking
but
though
the
conclusion
of
this
life
of
crime
may
perhaps
be
deprived
of
some
of
the
marvelous
effect
which
in
our
day
can
be
given
to
a
narrative
only
by
incredible
improbabilities
it
is
necessary
before
we
accompany
jacques
collin
to
the
public
prosecutor
s
room
that
we
should
follow
madame
camusot
in
her
visits
during
the
time
we
have
spent
in
the
conciergerie
one
of
the
obligations
which
the
historian
of
manners
must
unfailingly
observe
is
that
of
never
marring
the
truth
for
the
sake
of
dramatic
arrangement
especially
when
the
truth
is
so
kind
as
to
be
in
itself
romantic
social
nature
particularly
in
paris
allows
of
such
freaks
of
chance
such
complications
of
whimsical
entanglements
that
it
constantly
outdoes
the
most
inventive
imagination
the
audacity
of
facts
by
sheer
improbability
or
indecorum
rises
to
heights
of
situation
forbidden
to
art
unless
they
are
softened
cleansed
and
purified
by
the
writer
madame
camusot
did
her
utmost
to
dress
herself
for
the
morning
almost
in
good
taste
a
difficult
task
for
the
wife
of
a
judge
who
for
six
years
has
lived
in
a
provincial
town
her
object
was
to
give
no
hold
for
criticism
to
the
marquise
d
espard
or
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
in
a
call
so
early
as
between
eight
and
nine
in
the
morning
amelie
cecile
camusot
nee
thirion
it
must
be
said
only
half
succeeded
and
in
a
matter
of
dress
is
this
not
a
twofold
blunder
few
people
can
imagine
how
useful
the
women
of
paris
are
to
ambitious
men
of
every
class
they
are
equally
necessary
in
the
world
of
fashion
and
the
world
of
thieves
where
as
we
have
seen
they
fill
a
most
important
part
for
instance
suppose
that
a
man
not
to
find
himself
left
in
the
lurch
must
absolutely
get
speech
within
a
given
time
with
the
high
functionary
who
was
of
such
immense
importance
under
the
restoration
and
who
is
to
this
day
called
the
keeper
of
the
seals
a
man
let
us
say
in
the
most
favorable
position
a
judge
that
is
to
say
a
man
familiar
with
the
way
of
things
he
is
compelled
to
seek
out
the
presiding
judge
of
a
circuit
or
some
private
or
official
secretary
and
prove
to
him
his
need
of
an
immediate
interview
but
is
a
keeper
of
the
seals
ever
visible
that
very
minute
in
the
middle
of
the
day
if
he
is
not
at
the
chamber
he
is
at
the
privy
council
or
signing
papers
or
hearing
a
case
in
the
early
morning
he
is
out
no
one
knows
where
in
the
evening
he
has
public
and
private
engagements
if
every
magistrate
could
claim
a
moment
s
interview
under
any
pretext
that
might
occur
to
him
the
supreme
judge
would
be
besieged
the
purpose
of
a
private
and
immediate
interview
is
therefore
submitted
to
the
judgment
of
one
of
those
mediatory
potentates
who
are
but
an
obstacle
to
be
removed
a
door
that
can
be
unlocked
so
long
as
it
is
not
held
by
a
rival
a
woman
at
once
goes
to
another
woman
she
can
get
straight
into
her
bedroom
if
she
can
arouse
the
curiosity
of
mistress
or
maid
especially
if
the
mistress
is
under
the
stress
of
a
strong
interest
or
pressing
necessity
call
this
female
potentate
madame
la
marquise
d
espard
with
whom
a
minister
has
to
come
to
terms
this
woman
writes
a
little
scented
note
which
her
carries
to
the
minister
s
the
note
greets
the
minister
on
his
waking
and
he
reads
it
at
once
though
the
minister
has
business
to
attend
to
the
man
is
enchanted
to
have
a
reason
for
calling
on
one
of
the
queens
of
paris
one
of
the
powers
of
the
faubourg
one
of
the
favorites
of
the
dauphiness
of
madame
or
of
the
king
casimir
perier
the
only
real
statesman
of
the
revolution
of
july
would
leave
anything
to
call
on
a
retired
gentleman
of
the
to
king
charles
x
this
theory
accounts
for
the
magical
effect
of
the
words
madame
madame
camusot
on
very
important
business
which
she
says
you
know
of
spoken
in
madame
d
espard
s
ear
by
her
maid
who
thought
she
was
awake
and
the
marquise
desired
that
amelie
should
be
shown
in
at
once
the
magistrate
s
wife
was
attentively
heard
when
she
began
with
these
words
madame
la
marquise
we
have
ruined
ourselves
by
trying
to
avenge
you
how
is
that
my
dear
replied
the
marquise
looking
at
madame
camusot
in
the
dim
light
that
fell
through
the
door
you
are
vastly
sweet
this
morning
in
that
little
bonnet
where
do
you
get
that
shape
you
are
very
kind
well
you
know
that
camusot
s
way
of
examining
lucien
de
rubempre
drove
the
young
man
to
despair
and
he
hanged
himself
in
oh
what
will
become
of
madame
de
serizy
cried
the
marquise
affecting
ignorance
that
she
might
hear
the
whole
story
once
more
alas
they
say
she
is
quite
mad
said
amelie
if
you
could
persuade
the
lord
keeper
to
send
for
my
husband
this
minute
by
special
messenger
to
meet
him
at
the
palais
the
minister
would
hear
some
strange
mysteries
and
report
them
no
doubt
to
the
king
then
camusot
s
enemies
would
be
reduced
to
but
who
are
camusot
s
enemies
asked
madame
d
espard
the
public
prosecutor
and
now
monsieur
de
very
good
my
dear
replied
madame
d
espard
who
owed
to
monsieur
de
granville
and
the
comte
de
serizy
her
defeat
in
the
disgraceful
proceedings
by
which
she
had
tried
to
have
her
husband
treated
as
a
lunatic
i
will
protect
you
i
never
forget
either
my
foes
or
my
she
rang
the
maid
drew
open
the
curtains
and
daylight
flooded
the
room
she
asked
for
her
desk
and
the
maid
brought
it
in
the
marquise
hastily
scrawled
a
few
lines
tell
godard
to
go
on
horseback
and
carry
this
note
to
the
chancellor
s
there
is
no
reply
said
she
to
the
maid
the
woman
went
out
of
the
room
quickly
but
in
spite
of
the
order
remained
at
the
door
for
some
minutes
there
are
great
mysteries
going
forward
then
asked
madame
d
espard
tell
me
all
about
it
dear
child
has
clotilde
de
grandlieu
put
a
finger
in
the
pie
you
will
know
everything
from
the
lord
keeper
for
my
husband
has
told
me
nothing
he
only
told
me
he
was
in
danger
it
would
be
better
for
us
that
madame
de
serizy
should
die
than
that
she
should
remain
poor
woman
said
the
marquise
but
was
she
not
mad
already
women
of
the
world
by
a
hundred
ways
of
pronouncing
the
same
phrase
illustrate
to
attentive
hearers
the
infinite
variety
of
musical
modes
the
soul
goes
out
into
the
voice
as
it
does
into
the
eyes
it
vibrates
in
light
and
in
air
the
elements
acted
on
by
the
eyes
and
the
voice
by
the
tone
she
gave
to
the
two
words
poor
woman
the
marquise
betrayed
the
joy
of
satisfied
hatred
the
pleasure
of
triumph
oh
what
woes
did
she
not
wish
to
befall
lucien
s
protectress
revenge
which
nothing
can
assuage
which
can
survive
the
person
hated
fills
us
with
dark
terrors
and
madame
camusot
though
harsh
herself
vindictive
and
quarrelsome
was
overwhelmed
she
could
find
nothing
to
say
and
was
silent
diane
told
me
that
leontine
went
to
the
prison
madame
d
espard
went
on
the
dear
duchess
is
in
despair
at
such
a
scandal
for
she
is
so
foolish
as
to
be
very
fond
of
madame
de
serizy
however
it
is
comprehensible
they
both
adored
that
little
fool
lucien
at
about
the
same
time
and
nothing
so
effectually
binds
or
severs
two
women
as
worshiping
at
the
same
altar
and
our
dear
friend
spent
two
hours
yesterday
in
leontine
s
room
the
poor
countess
it
seems
says
dreadful
things
i
heard
that
it
was
disgusting
a
woman
of
rank
ought
not
to
give
way
to
such
bah
a
purely
physical
the
duchess
came
to
see
me
as
pale
as
death
she
really
was
very
brave
there
are
monstrous
things
connected
with
this
my
husband
will
tell
the
keeper
of
the
seals
all
he
knows
for
his
own
justification
for
they
wanted
to
save
lucien
and
he
madame
la
marquise
did
his
duty
an
examining
judge
always
has
to
question
people
in
private
at
the
time
fixed
by
law
he
had
to
ask
the
poor
little
wretch
something
if
only
for
form
s
sake
and
the
young
fellow
did
not
understand
and
confessed
things
he
was
an
impertinent
fool
said
madame
d
espard
in
a
hard
tone
the
judge
s
wife
kept
silence
on
hearing
this
sentence
though
we
failed
in
the
matter
of
the
commission
in
lunacy
it
was
not
camusot
s
fault
i
shall
never
forget
that
said
the
marquise
after
a
pause
it
was
lucien
monsieur
de
serizy
monsieur
de
bauvan
and
monsieur
de
granville
who
overthrew
us
with
time
god
will
be
on
my
side
all
those
people
will
come
to
be
quite
easy
i
will
send
the
chevalier
d
espard
to
the
keeper
of
the
seals
that
he
may
desire
your
husbands
s
presence
immediately
if
that
is
of
any
oh
madame
listen
said
the
marquise
i
promise
you
the
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
at
once
it
will
be
a
conspicuous
testimonial
of
satisfaction
with
your
conduct
in
this
affair
yes
it
implies
further
blame
on
lucien
it
will
prove
him
guilty
men
do
not
commonly
hang
themselves
for
the
pleasure
of
now
my
pretty
dear
ten
minutes
later
madame
camusot
was
in
the
bedroom
of
the
beautiful
diane
de
maufrigneuse
who
had
not
gone
to
bed
till
one
and
at
nine
o
clock
had
not
yet
slept
however
insensible
duchesses
may
be
even
these
women
whose
hearts
are
of
stone
can
not
see
a
friend
a
victim
to
madness
without
being
painfully
impressed
by
it
and
besides
the
connection
between
diane
and
lucien
though
at
an
end
now
eighteen
months
since
had
left
such
memories
with
the
duchess
that
the
poor
boy
s
disastrous
end
had
been
to
her
also
a
fearful
blow
all
night
diane
had
seen
visions
of
the
beautiful
youth
so
charming
so
poetical
who
had
been
so
delightful
a
lover
painted
as
leontine
depicted
him
with
the
vividness
of
wild
delirium
she
had
letters
from
lucien
that
she
had
kept
intoxicating
letters
worthy
to
compare
with
mirabeau
s
to
sophie
but
more
literary
more
elaborate
for
lucien
s
letters
had
been
dictated
by
the
most
powerful
of
passions
vanity
having
the
most
bewitching
of
duchesses
for
his
mistress
and
seeing
her
commit
any
folly
for
him
secret
follies
of
course
had
turned
lucien
s
head
with
happiness
the
lover
s
pride
had
inspired
the
poet
and
the
duchess
had
treasured
these
touching
letters
as
some
old
men
keep
indecent
prints
for
the
sake
of
their
extravagant
praise
of
all
that
was
least
in
her
nature
and
he
died
in
a
squalid
prison
cried
she
to
herself
putting
the
letters
away
in
a
panic
when
she
heard
her
maid
knocking
gently
at
her
door
madame
camusot
said
the
woman
on
business
of
the
greatest
importance
to
you
madame
la
diane
sprang
to
her
feet
in
terror
oh
cried
she
looking
at
amelie
who
had
assumed
a
duly
condoling
air
i
guess
it
all
my
letters
it
is
about
my
letters
oh
my
letters
my
letters
she
sank
on
to
a
couch
she
remembered
now
how
in
the
extravagance
of
her
passion
she
had
answered
lucien
in
the
same
vein
had
lauded
the
man
s
poetry
as
he
has
sung
the
charms
of
the
woman
and
in
what
a
strain
alas
yes
madame
i
have
come
to
save
what
is
dearer
to
you
than
life
your
honor
compose
yourself
and
get
dressed
we
must
go
to
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
happily
for
you
you
are
not
the
only
person
but
at
the
palais
yesterday
leontine
burned
i
am
told
all
the
letters
found
at
poor
lucien
but
madame
behind
lucien
there
was
jacques
collin
cried
the
magistrate
s
wife
you
always
forget
that
horrible
companionship
which
beyond
question
led
to
that
charming
and
lamented
young
man
s
end
that
machiavelli
of
the
galleys
never
loses
his
head
monsieur
camusot
is
convinced
that
the
wretch
has
in
some
safe
all
the
most
compromising
letters
written
by
you
ladies
to
his
his
friend
the
duchess
hastily
put
in
you
are
right
my
child
we
must
hold
council
at
the
grandlieus
we
are
all
concerned
in
this
matter
and
serizy
happily
will
lend
us
his
extreme
peril
as
we
have
observed
in
the
scenes
in
the
conciergerie
has
a
hold
over
the
soul
not
less
terrible
than
that
of
powerful
reagents
over
the
body
it
is
a
mental
voltaic
battery
the
day
perhaps
is
not
far
off
when
the
process
shall
be
discovered
by
which
feeling
is
chemically
converted
into
a
fluid
not
unlike
the
electric
fluid
the
phenomena
were
the
same
in
the
convict
and
the
duchess
this
crushed
woman
who
had
not
slept
who
was
so
particular
over
her
dressing
had
recovered
the
strength
of
a
lioness
at
bay
and
the
presence
of
mind
of
a
general
under
fire
diane
chose
her
gown
and
got
through
her
dressing
with
the
alacrity
of
a
grisette
who
is
her
own
it
was
so
astounding
that
the
lady
stood
for
a
moment
so
greatly
was
she
surprised
to
see
her
mistress
in
her
shift
not
ill
pleased
perhaps
to
let
the
judge
s
wife
discern
through
the
thin
cloud
of
lawn
a
form
as
white
and
as
perfect
as
that
of
canova
s
venus
it
was
like
a
gem
in
a
fold
of
tissue
paper
diane
suddenly
remembered
where
a
pair
of
stays
had
been
put
that
fastened
in
front
sparing
a
woman
in
a
hurry
the
time
and
fatigue
of
being
laced
she
had
arranged
the
lace
trimming
of
her
shift
and
the
fulness
of
the
bosom
by
the
time
the
maid
had
fetched
her
petticoat
and
crowned
the
work
by
putting
on
her
gown
while
amelie
at
a
sign
from
the
maid
hooked
the
bodice
behind
the
woman
brought
out
a
pair
of
thread
stockings
velvet
boots
a
shawl
and
a
bonnet
amelie
and
the
maid
each
drew
on
a
stocking
you
are
the
loveliest
creature
i
ever
saw
said
amelie
insidiously
kissing
diane
s
elegant
and
polished
knee
with
an
eager
impulse
madame
has
not
her
match
cried
the
maid
there
there
josette
hold
your
tongue
replied
the
have
you
a
carriage
she
went
on
to
madame
camusot
then
come
along
my
dear
we
can
talk
on
the
and
the
duchess
ran
down
the
great
stairs
of
the
hotel
de
cadignan
putting
on
her
gloves
as
she
went
a
thing
she
had
never
been
known
to
do
to
the
hotel
de
grandlieu
and
drive
fast
said
she
to
one
of
her
men
signing
to
him
to
get
up
behind
the
footman
hesitated
it
was
a
hackney
coach
ah
madame
la
duchesse
you
never
told
me
that
the
young
man
had
letters
of
yours
otherwise
camusot
would
have
proceeded
differently
leontine
s
state
so
occupied
my
thoughts
that
i
forgot
myself
entirely
the
poor
woman
was
almost
crazy
the
day
before
yesterday
imagine
the
effect
on
her
of
this
tragical
termination
if
you
could
only
know
child
what
a
morning
we
went
through
yesterday
it
is
enough
to
make
one
forswear
love
yesterday
leontine
and
i
were
dragged
across
paris
by
a
horrible
old
woman
an
buyer
a
domineering
creature
to
that
stinking
and
sty
they
call
the
palace
of
justice
and
i
said
to
her
as
i
took
her
there
is
not
this
enough
to
make
us
fall
on
our
knees
and
cry
out
like
madame
de
nucingen
when
she
went
through
one
of
those
awful
mediterranean
storms
on
her
way
to
naples
dear
god
save
me
this
time
and
never
again
these
two
days
will
certainly
have
shortened
my
what
fools
we
are
ever
to
write
but
love
prompts
us
we
receive
pages
that
fire
the
heart
through
the
eyes
and
everything
is
in
a
blaze
prudence
deserts
us
we
reply
but
why
reply
when
you
can
act
said
madame
camusot
it
is
grand
to
lose
oneself
utterly
cried
the
duchess
with
pride
it
is
the
luxury
of
the
beautiful
women
are
excusable
said
madame
camusot
modestly
they
have
more
opportunities
of
falling
than
we
the
duchess
smiled
we
are
always
too
generous
said
diane
de
maufrigneuse
i
shall
do
just
like
that
odious
madame
d
and
what
does
she
do
asked
the
judge
s
wife
very
curious
she
has
written
a
thousand
so
many
exclaimed
amelie
interrupting
the
duchess
well
my
dear
and
not
a
word
that
could
compromise
her
is
to
be
found
in
any
one
of
you
would
be
incapable
of
maintaining
such
coldness
such
caution
said
madame
camusot
you
are
a
woman
you
are
one
of
those
angels
who
can
not
stand
out
against
the
devil
i
have
made
a
vow
to
write
no
more
letters
i
never
in
my
life
wrote
to
anybody
but
that
unhappy
i
will
keep
his
letters
to
my
dying
day
my
dear
child
they
are
fire
and
sometimes
we
want
but
if
they
were
found
said
amelie
with
a
little
shocked
expression
oh
i
should
say
they
were
part
of
a
romance
i
was
writing
for
i
have
copied
them
all
my
dear
and
burned
the
oh
madame
as
a
reward
allow
me
to
read
perhaps
child
said
the
duchess
and
then
you
will
see
that
he
did
not
write
such
letters
as
those
to
this
speech
was
woman
all
the
world
over
of
every
age
and
every
land
madame
camusot
like
the
frog
in
la
fontaine
s
fable
was
ready
to
burst
her
skin
with
the
joy
of
going
to
the
grandlieus
in
the
society
of
the
beautiful
diane
de
maufrigneuse
this
morning
she
would
forge
one
of
the
links
that
are
so
needful
to
ambition
she
could
already
hear
herself
addressed
as
madame
la
presidente
she
felt
the
ineffable
gladness
of
triumphing
over
stupendous
obstacles
of
which
the
greatest
was
her
husband
s
ineptitude
as
yet
unrevealed
but
to
her
well
known
to
win
success
for
a
man
that
is
to
a
woman
as
to
a
king
the
delight
which
tempts
great
actors
when
they
act
a
bad
play
a
hundred
times
over
it
is
the
very
drunkenness
of
egoism
it
is
in
a
way
the
saturnalia
of
power
power
can
prove
itself
to
itself
only
by
the
strange
misapplication
which
leads
it
to
crown
some
absurd
person
with
the
laurels
of
success
while
insulting
genius
the
only
which
power
can
not
touch
the
knighting
of
caligula
s
horse
an
imperial
farce
has
been
and
always
will
be
a
favorite
performance
in
a
few
minutes
diane
and
amelie
had
exchanged
the
elegant
disorder
of
the
fair
diane
s
bedroom
for
the
severe
but
dignified
and
splendid
austerity
of
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
s
rooms
she
a
portuguese
and
very
pious
always
rose
at
eight
to
attend
mass
at
the
little
church
of
a
chapelry
to
d
aquin
standing
at
that
time
on
the
esplanade
of
the
invalides
this
chapel
now
destroyed
was
rebuilt
in
the
rue
de
bourgogne
pending
the
building
of
a
gothic
church
to
be
dedicated
to
on
hearing
the
first
words
spoken
in
her
ear
by
diane
de
maufrigneuse
this
saintly
lady
went
to
find
monsieur
de
grandlieu
and
brought
him
back
at
once
the
duke
threw
a
flashing
look
at
madame
camusot
one
of
those
rapid
glances
with
which
a
man
of
the
world
can
guess
at
a
whole
existence
or
often
read
a
soul
amelie
s
dress
greatly
helped
the
duke
to
decipher
the
story
of
a
life
from
alencon
to
mantes
and
from
mantes
to
paris
oh
if
only
the
lawyer
s
wife
could
have
understood
this
gift
in
dukes
she
could
never
have
endured
that
politely
ironical
look
she
saw
the
politeness
only
ignorance
shares
the
privileges
of
fine
breeding
this
is
madame
camusot
a
daughter
of
thirion
s
one
of
the
cabinet
ushers
said
the
duchess
to
her
husband
the
duke
bowed
with
extreme
politeness
to
the
wife
of
a
legal
official
and
his
face
became
a
little
less
grave
the
duke
had
rung
for
his
valet
who
now
came
in
go
to
the
rue
take
a
coach
ring
at
a
side
door
no
tell
the
man
who
opens
the
door
that
i
beg
his
master
will
come
here
and
if
the
gentleman
is
at
home
bring
him
back
with
mention
my
name
that
will
remove
all
difficulties
and
do
not
be
gone
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
another
footman
the
duchess
servant
came
in
as
soon
as
the
other
was
gone
go
from
me
to
the
duc
de
chaulieu
and
send
up
this
the
duke
gave
him
a
card
folded
down
in
a
particular
way
when
the
two
friends
wanted
to
meet
at
once
on
any
urgent
or
confidential
business
which
would
not
allow
of
they
used
this
means
of
communication
thus
we
see
that
similar
customs
prevail
in
every
rank
of
society
and
differ
only
in
manner
civility
and
small
details
the
world
of
fashion
too
has
its
argot
its
slang
but
that
slang
is
called
style
are
you
quite
sure
madame
of
the
existence
of
the
letters
you
say
were
written
by
mademoiselle
clotilde
de
grandlieu
to
this
young
man
said
the
duc
de
grandlieu
and
he
cast
a
look
at
madame
camusot
as
a
sailor
casts
a
sounding
line
i
have
not
seen
them
but
there
is
reason
to
fear
it
replied
madame
camusot
quaking
my
daughter
can
have
written
nothing
we
would
not
own
to
said
the
duchess
poor
duchess
thought
diane
with
a
glance
at
the
duke
that
terrified
him
what
do
you
think
my
dear
little
diane
said
the
duke
in
a
whisper
as
he
led
her
away
into
a
recess
clotilde
is
so
crazy
about
lucien
my
dear
friend
that
she
had
made
an
assignation
with
him
before
leaving
if
it
had
not
been
for
little
lenoncourt
she
would
perhaps
have
gone
off
with
him
into
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
i
know
that
lucien
used
to
write
letters
to
her
which
were
enough
to
turn
the
brain
of
a
we
are
three
daughters
of
eve
in
the
coils
of
the
serpent
of
the
duke
and
diane
came
back
to
the
duchess
and
madame
camusot
who
were
talking
in
undertones
amelie
following
the
advice
of
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
affected
piety
to
win
the
proud
lady
s
favor
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
a
dreadful
escaped
convict
said
the
duke
with
a
peculiar
shrug
this
is
what
comes
of
opening
one
s
house
to
people
one
is
not
absolutely
sure
of
before
admitting
an
acquaintance
one
ought
to
know
all
about
his
fortune
his
relations
all
his
previous
history
this
speech
is
the
moral
of
my
story
from
the
aristocratic
point
of
view
that
is
past
and
over
said
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
now
we
must
think
of
saving
that
poor
madame
de
serizy
clotilde
and
me
we
can
but
wait
for
henri
i
have
sent
to
him
but
everything
really
depends
on
the
man
gentil
is
gone
to
fetch
god
grant
that
man
may
be
in
paris
madame
he
added
to
madame
camusot
thank
you
so
much
for
having
thought
of
us
this
was
madame
camusot
s
dismissal
the
daughter
of
the
court
usher
had
wit
enough
to
understand
the
duke
she
rose
but
the
duchess
de
maufrigneuse
with
the
enchanting
grace
which
had
won
her
so
much
friendship
and
discretion
took
amelie
by
the
hand
as
if
to
show
her
in
a
way
to
the
duke
and
duchess
on
my
own
account
said
she
to
say
nothing
of
her
having
been
up
before
daybreak
to
save
us
all
i
may
ask
for
more
than
a
remembrance
for
my
little
madame
camusot
in
the
first
place
she
has
already
done
me
such
a
service
as
i
can
not
forget
and
then
she
is
wholly
devoted
to
our
side
she
and
her
husband
i
have
promised
that
her
camusot
shall
have
advancement
and
i
beg
you
above
everything
to
help
him
on
for
my
you
need
no
such
recommendation
said
the
duke
to
madame
camusot
the
grandlieus
always
remember
a
service
done
them
the
king
s
adherents
will
ere
long
have
a
chance
of
distinguishing
themselves
they
will
be
called
upon
to
prove
their
devotion
your
husband
will
be
placed
in
the
front
madame
camusot
withdrew
proud
happy
puffed
up
to
suffocation
she
reached
home
triumphant
she
admired
herself
she
made
light
of
the
public
prosecutor
s
hostility
she
said
to
herself
supposing
we
were
to
send
monsieur
de
granville
flying
it
was
high
time
for
madame
camusot
to
vanish
the
duc
de
chaulieu
one
of
the
king
s
prime
favorites
met
the
bourgeoise
on
the
outer
steps
henri
said
the
duc
de
grandlieu
when
he
heard
his
friend
announced
make
haste
i
beg
of
you
to
get
to
the
chateau
try
to
see
the
king
the
business
of
this
and
he
led
the
duke
into
the
where
he
had
been
talking
to
the
airy
and
charming
diane
now
and
then
the
duc
de
chaulieu
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
flighty
duchess
who
while
talking
to
the
pious
duchess
and
submitting
to
be
lectured
answered
the
duc
de
chaulieu
s
expressive
looks
my
dear
child
said
the
duc
de
grandlieu
to
her
at
last
the
being
ended
do
be
good
come
now
and
he
took
diane
s
hands
observe
the
proprieties
of
life
do
not
compromise
yourself
any
more
write
no
letters
letters
my
dear
have
caused
as
much
private
woe
as
public
mischief
what
might
be
excusable
in
a
girl
like
clotilde
in
love
for
the
first
time
had
no
excuse
in
an
old
soldier
who
has
been
under
fire
said
diane
with
a
pout
this
grimace
and
the
duchess
jest
brought
a
smile
to
the
face
of
the
two
dukes
and
of
the
pious
duchess
herself
but
for
four
years
i
have
never
written
a
are
we
saved
asked
diane
who
hid
her
curiosity
under
this
childishness
not
yet
said
the
duc
de
chaulieu
you
have
no
notion
how
difficult
it
is
to
do
an
arbitrary
thing
in
a
constitutional
king
it
is
what
infidelity
is
in
a
wife
it
is
the
fascinating
sin
said
the
duc
de
grandlieu
forbidden
fruit
said
diane
smiling
oh
how
i
wish
i
were
the
government
for
i
have
none
of
that
fruit
left
i
have
eaten
it
oh
my
dear
my
dear
said
the
elder
duchess
you
really
go
too
the
two
dukes
hearing
a
coach
stop
at
the
door
with
the
clatter
of
horses
checked
in
full
gallop
bowed
to
the
ladies
and
left
them
going
into
the
duc
de
grandlieu
s
study
whither
came
the
gentleman
from
the
rue
no
less
a
man
than
the
chief
of
the
king
s
private
police
the
obscure
but
puissant
corentin
go
on
said
the
duc
de
grandlieu
go
first
monsieur
de
corentin
surprised
that
the
duke
should
have
remembered
him
went
forward
after
bowing
low
to
the
two
noblemen
always
about
the
same
individual
or
about
his
concerns
my
dear
sir
said
the
duc
de
grandlieu
but
he
is
dead
said
corentin
he
has
left
a
partner
said
the
duc
de
chaulieu
a
very
tough
the
convict
jacques
collin
replied
corentin
will
you
speak
ferdinand
said
the
duke
de
chaulieu
to
his
friend
that
wretch
is
an
object
of
fear
said
the
duc
de
grandlieu
for
he
has
possessed
himself
so
as
to
be
able
to
levy
blackmail
of
the
letters
written
by
madame
de
serizy
and
madame
de
maufrigneuse
to
lucien
chardon
that
man
s
tool
it
would
seem
that
it
was
a
matter
of
system
in
the
young
man
to
extract
passionate
letters
in
return
for
his
own
for
i
am
told
that
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
had
written
some
at
least
so
we
fear
and
we
can
not
find
out
from
her
she
is
gone
that
little
young
man
replied
corentin
was
incapable
of
so
much
foresight
that
was
a
precaution
due
to
the
abbe
carlos
corentin
rested
his
elbow
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
on
which
he
was
sitting
and
his
head
on
his
hand
meditating
money
the
man
has
more
than
we
have
said
he
esther
gobseck
served
him
as
a
bait
to
extract
nearly
two
million
francs
from
that
well
of
gold
called
gentlemen
get
me
full
legal
powers
and
i
will
rid
you
of
the
and
the
letters
asked
the
duc
de
grandlieu
listen
to
me
gentlemen
said
corentin
standing
up
his
betraying
his
excitement
he
thrust
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
black
doeskin
trousers
shaped
over
the
shoes
this
great
actor
in
the
historical
drama
of
the
day
had
only
stopped
to
put
on
a
waistcoat
and
and
had
not
changed
his
morning
trousers
so
well
he
knew
how
grateful
men
can
be
for
immediate
action
in
certain
cases
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
quite
at
his
ease
haranguing
loudly
as
if
he
had
been
alone
he
is
a
convict
he
could
be
sent
off
to
bicetre
without
trial
and
put
in
solitary
confinement
without
a
soul
to
speak
to
and
left
there
to
but
he
may
have
given
instructions
to
his
adherents
foreseeing
this
but
he
was
put
into
the
secret
cells
said
the
duc
de
grandlieu
the
moment
he
was
taken
into
custody
at
that
woman
s
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
secret
cell
for
such
a
fellow
as
he
is
said
corentin
he
is
a
match
for
for
me
what
is
to
be
done
said
the
dukes
to
each
other
by
a
glance
we
can
send
the
scoundrel
back
to
the
hulks
at
once
to
rochefort
he
will
be
dead
in
six
months
oh
without
committing
any
crime
he
added
in
reply
to
a
gesture
on
the
part
of
the
duc
de
grandlieu
what
do
you
expect
a
convict
can
not
hold
out
more
than
six
months
of
a
hot
summer
if
he
is
made
to
work
really
hard
among
the
marshes
of
the
charente
but
this
is
of
no
use
if
our
man
has
taken
precautions
with
regard
to
the
letters
if
the
villain
has
been
suspicious
of
his
foes
and
that
is
probable
we
must
find
out
what
steps
he
has
taken
then
if
the
present
holder
of
the
letters
is
poor
he
is
open
to
bribery
so
no
we
must
make
jacques
collin
speak
what
a
duel
he
will
beat
me
the
better
plan
would
be
to
purchase
those
letters
by
exchange
for
another
document
a
letter
of
reprieve
and
to
place
the
man
in
my
gang
jacques
collin
is
the
only
man
alive
who
is
clever
enough
to
come
after
me
poor
contenson
and
dear
old
peyrade
both
being
dead
jacques
collin
killed
those
two
unrivaled
spies
on
purpose
as
it
were
to
make
a
place
for
himself
so
you
see
gentlemen
you
must
give
me
a
free
hand
jacques
collin
is
in
the
conciergerie
i
will
go
to
see
monsieur
de
granville
in
his
court
send
some
one
you
can
trust
to
meet
me
there
for
i
must
have
a
letter
to
show
to
monsieur
de
granville
who
knows
nothing
of
me
i
will
hand
the
letter
to
the
president
of
the
council
a
very
impressive
sponsor
you
have
half
an
hour
before
you
for
i
need
half
an
hour
to
dress
that
is
to
say
to
make
myself
presentable
to
the
eyes
of
the
public
monsieur
said
the
duc
de
chaulieu
i
know
your
wonderful
skill
i
only
ask
you
to
say
yes
or
no
will
you
be
bound
to
succeed
yes
if
i
have
full
powers
and
your
word
that
i
shall
never
be
questioned
about
the
my
plan
is
this
sinister
reply
made
the
two
fine
gentlemen
shiver
go
on
then
monsieur
said
the
duc
de
chaulieu
you
can
set
down
the
charges
of
the
case
among
those
you
are
in
the
habit
of
corentin
bowed
and
went
away
henri
de
lenoncourt
for
whom
ferdinand
de
grandlieu
had
a
carriage
brought
out
went
off
forthwith
to
the
king
whom
he
was
privileged
to
see
at
all
times
in
right
of
his
office
thus
all
the
various
interests
that
had
got
entangled
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
ranks
of
society
were
to
meet
presently
in
monsieur
de
granville
s
room
at
the
palais
all
brought
together
by
necessity
embodied
in
three
men
justice
in
monsieur
de
granville
and
the
family
in
corentin
face
to
face
with
jacques
collin
the
terrible
foe
who
represented
social
crime
in
its
fiercest
energy
what
a
duel
is
that
between
justice
and
arbitrary
wills
on
one
side
and
the
hulks
and
cunning
on
the
other
the
hulks
symbolical
of
that
daring
which
throws
off
calculation
and
reflection
which
avails
itself
of
any
means
which
has
none
of
the
hyprocrisy
of
justice
but
is
the
hideous
outcome
of
the
starving
stomach
the
swift
and
bloodthirsty
pretext
of
hunger
is
it
not
attack
as
against
theft
as
against
property
the
terrible
quarrel
between
the
social
state
and
the
natural
man
fought
out
on
the
narrowest
possible
ground
in
short
it
is
a
terrible
and
vivid
image
of
those
compromises
hostile
to
social
interests
which
the
representatives
of
authority
when
they
lack
power
submit
to
with
the
fiercest
rebels
when
monsieur
camusot
was
announced
the
public
prosecutor
signed
that
he
should
be
admitted
monsieur
de
granville
had
foreseen
this
visit
and
wished
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
examining
judge
as
to
how
to
wind
up
this
business
of
lucien
s
death
the
end
could
no
longer
be
that
on
which
he
had
decided
the
day
before
in
agreement
with
camusot
before
the
suicide
of
the
hapless
poet
sit
down
monsieur
camusot
said
monsieur
de
granville
dropping
into
his
armchair
the
public
prosecutor
alone
with
the
inferior
judge
made
no
secret
of
his
depressed
state
camusot
looked
at
monsieur
de
granville
and
observed
his
almost
livid
pallor
and
such
utter
fatigue
such
complete
prostration
as
betrayed
greater
suffering
perhaps
than
that
of
the
condemned
man
to
whom
the
clerk
had
announced
the
rejection
of
his
appeal
and
yet
that
announcement
in
the
forms
of
justice
is
a
much
as
to
say
prepare
to
die
your
last
hour
has
i
will
return
later
monsieur
le
comte
said
camusot
though
business
is
pressing
no
stay
replied
the
public
prosecutor
with
dignity
a
magistrate
monsieur
must
accept
his
anxieties
and
know
how
to
hide
them
i
was
in
fault
if
you
saw
any
traces
of
agitation
in
me
camusot
bowed
apologetically
god
grant
you
may
never
know
these
crucial
perplexities
of
our
life
a
man
might
sink
under
less
i
have
just
spent
the
night
with
one
of
my
most
intimate
i
have
but
two
friends
the
comte
octave
de
bauvan
and
the
comte
de
we
sat
together
monsieur
de
serizy
the
count
and
i
from
six
in
the
evening
till
six
this
morning
taking
it
in
turns
to
go
from
the
to
madame
de
serizy
s
bedside
fearing
each
time
that
we
might
find
her
dead
or
irremediably
insane
desplein
bianchon
and
sinard
never
left
the
room
and
she
has
two
nurses
the
count
worships
his
wife
imagine
the
night
i
have
spent
between
a
woman
crazy
with
love
and
a
man
crazy
with
despair
and
a
statesman
s
despair
is
not
like
that
of
an
idiot
serizy
as
calm
as
if
he
were
sitting
in
his
place
in
council
clutched
his
chair
to
force
himself
to
show
us
an
unmoved
countenance
while
sweat
stood
over
the
brows
bent
by
so
much
hard
worn
out
by
want
of
sleep
i
dozed
from
five
till
seven
and
i
had
to
be
here
by
eight
to
warrant
an
execution
take
my
word
for
it
monsieur
camusot
when
a
judge
has
been
toiling
all
night
in
such
gulfs
of
sorrow
feeling
the
heavy
hand
of
god
on
all
human
concerns
and
heaviest
on
noble
souls
it
is
hard
to
sit
down
here
in
front
of
a
desk
and
say
in
cold
blood
cut
off
a
head
at
four
o
clock
destroy
one
of
god
s
creatures
full
of
life
health
and
strength
and
yet
this
is
my
duty
sunk
in
grief
myself
i
must
order
the
scaffold
the
condemned
wretch
can
not
know
that
his
judge
suffers
anguish
equal
to
his
own
at
this
moment
he
and
i
linked
by
a
sheet
of
paper
i
society
avenging
itself
he
the
crime
to
be
avenged
embody
the
same
duty
seen
from
two
sides
we
are
two
lives
joined
for
the
moment
by
the
sword
of
the
law
who
pities
the
judge
s
deep
sorrow
who
can
soothe
it
our
glory
is
to
bury
it
in
the
depth
of
our
heart
the
priest
with
his
life
given
to
god
the
soldier
with
a
thousand
deaths
for
his
country
s
sake
seem
to
me
far
happier
than
the
magistrate
with
his
doubts
and
fears
and
appalling
responsibility
you
know
who
the
condemned
man
is
monsieur
de
granville
went
on
a
young
man
of
as
handsome
as
he
who
killed
himself
yesterday
and
as
fair
condemned
against
all
our
anticipations
for
the
only
proof
against
him
was
his
concealment
of
the
stolen
goods
though
sentenced
the
lad
will
confess
nothing
for
seventy
days
he
has
held
out
against
every
test
constantly
declaring
that
he
is
innocent
for
two
months
i
have
felt
two
heads
on
my
shoulders
i
would
give
a
year
of
my
life
if
he
would
confess
for
juries
need
encouragement
and
imagine
what
a
blow
it
would
be
to
justice
if
some
day
it
should
be
discovered
that
the
crime
for
which
he
is
punished
was
committed
by
another
in
paris
everything
is
so
terribly
important
the
most
trivial
incidents
in
the
law
courts
have
political
consequences
the
jury
an
institution
regarded
by
the
legislators
of
the
revolution
as
a
source
of
strength
is
in
fact
an
instrument
of
social
ruin
for
it
fails
in
action
it
does
not
sufficiently
protect
society
the
jury
trifles
with
its
functions
the
class
of
jurymen
is
divided
into
two
parties
one
averse
to
capital
punishment
the
result
is
a
total
upheaval
of
true
equality
in
administration
of
the
law
parricide
a
most
horrible
crime
is
in
some
departments
treated
with
leniency
while
in
others
a
common
murder
so
to
speak
is
punished
with
death
there
are
in
penal
servitude
parricides
who
have
been
allowed
the
benefit
of
and
what
would
happen
if
here
in
paris
in
our
home
district
an
innocent
man
should
be
executed
he
is
an
escaped
convict
said
monsieur
camusot
diffidently
the
opposition
and
the
press
would
make
him
a
paschal
lamb
cried
monsieur
de
granville
and
the
opposition
would
enjoy
him
for
he
is
a
fanatical
corsican
full
of
his
native
notions
and
his
murders
were
a
in
that
island
you
may
kill
your
enemy
and
think
yourself
and
be
thought
a
very
good
man
a
magistrate
i
tell
you
is
an
unhappy
man
they
ought
to
live
apart
from
all
society
like
the
pontiffs
of
old
the
world
should
never
see
them
but
at
fixed
hours
leaving
their
cells
grave
and
old
and
venerable
passing
sentence
like
the
high
priests
of
antiquity
who
combined
in
their
person
the
functions
of
judicial
and
sacerdotal
authority
we
should
be
accessible
only
in
our
high
as
it
is
we
are
to
be
seen
every
day
amused
or
unhappy
like
other
men
we
are
to
be
found
in
and
at
home
as
ordinary
citizens
moved
by
our
passions
and
we
seem
perhaps
more
grotesque
than
this
bitter
cry
broken
by
pauses
and
interjections
and
emphasized
by
gestures
which
gave
it
an
eloquence
impossible
to
reduce
to
writing
made
camusot
s
blood
run
chill
and
i
monsieur
said
he
began
yesterday
my
apprenticeship
to
the
sufferings
of
our
i
could
have
died
of
that
young
fellow
s
death
he
misunderstood
my
wish
to
be
lenient
and
the
poor
wretch
committed
ah
you
ought
never
to
have
examined
him
cried
monsieur
de
granville
it
is
so
easy
to
oblige
by
doing
and
the
law
monsieur
replied
camusot
he
had
been
in
custody
two
the
mischief
is
done
said
the
public
prosecutor
i
have
done
my
best
to
remedy
what
is
indeed
irremediable
my
carriage
and
servants
are
following
the
poor
weak
poet
to
the
grave
serizy
has
sent
his
too
nay
more
he
accepts
the
duty
imposed
on
him
by
the
unfortunate
boy
and
will
act
as
his
executor
by
promising
this
to
his
wife
he
won
from
her
a
gleam
of
returning
sanity
and
count
octave
is
attending
the
funeral
in
well
then
monsieur
le
comte
said
camusot
let
us
complete
our
work
we
have
a
very
dangerous
man
on
our
hands
he
is
jacques
collin
and
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
the
ruffian
will
be
recognized
then
we
are
lost
cried
monsieur
de
granville
he
is
at
this
moment
shut
up
with
your
condemned
murderer
who
on
the
hulks
was
to
him
what
lucien
has
been
in
paris
a
favorite
protege
disguised
as
a
gendarme
is
watching
the
what
business
has
the
superior
police
to
interfere
said
the
public
prosecutor
he
has
no
business
to
act
without
my
orders
all
the
conciergerie
must
know
that
we
have
caught
jacques
well
i
have
come
on
purpose
to
tell
you
that
this
daring
felon
has
in
his
possession
the
most
compromising
letters
of
lucien
s
correspondence
with
madame
de
serizy
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
and
mademoiselle
clotilde
de
are
you
sure
of
that
asked
monsieur
de
granville
his
face
full
of
pained
surprise
you
shall
hear
monsieur
le
comte
what
reason
i
have
to
fear
such
a
misfortune
when
i
untied
the
papers
found
in
the
young
man
s
rooms
jacques
collin
gave
a
keen
look
at
the
parcel
and
smiled
with
satisfaction
in
a
way
that
no
examining
judge
could
misunderstand
so
deep
a
villain
as
jacques
collin
takes
good
care
not
to
let
such
a
weapon
slip
through
his
fingers
what
is
to
be
said
if
these
documents
should
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
counsel
chosen
by
that
rascal
from
among
the
foes
of
the
government
and
the
aristocracy
my
wife
to
whom
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
has
shown
so
much
kindness
is
gone
to
warn
her
and
by
this
time
they
must
be
with
the
grandlieus
holding
but
we
can
not
possibly
try
the
man
cried
the
public
prosecutor
rising
and
striding
up
and
down
the
room
he
must
have
put
the
papers
in
some
safe
place
i
know
where
said
camusot
these
words
finally
effaced
every
prejudice
the
public
prosecutor
had
felt
against
him
well
then
said
monsieur
de
granville
sitting
down
again
on
my
way
here
this
morning
i
reflected
deeply
on
this
miserable
business
jacques
collin
has
an
aunt
an
aunt
by
nature
not
putative
a
woman
concerning
whom
the
superior
police
have
communicated
a
report
to
the
prefecture
he
is
this
woman
s
pupil
and
idol
she
is
his
father
s
sister
her
name
is
jacqueline
collin
this
wretched
woman
carries
on
a
trade
as
a
wardrobe
purchaser
and
by
the
connection
this
business
has
secured
her
she
gets
hold
of
many
family
secrets
if
jacques
collin
has
intrusted
those
papers
which
would
be
his
salvation
to
any
one
s
keeping
it
is
to
that
of
this
creature
have
her
the
public
prosecutor
gave
camusot
a
keen
look
as
much
as
to
say
this
man
is
not
such
a
fool
as
i
thought
him
he
is
still
young
and
does
not
yet
know
how
to
handle
the
reins
of
but
camusot
went
on
in
order
to
succeed
we
must
give
up
all
the
plans
we
laid
yesterday
and
i
came
to
take
your
advice
your
orders
the
public
prosecutor
took
up
his
and
tapped
it
against
the
edge
of
the
table
with
one
of
the
tricky
movements
familiar
to
thoughtful
men
when
they
give
themselves
up
to
meditation
three
noble
families
involved
he
exclaimed
we
must
not
make
the
smallest
blunder
you
are
right
as
a
first
step
let
us
act
on
fouche
s
principle
arrest
and
jacques
collin
must
at
once
be
sent
back
to
the
secret
that
is
to
proclaim
him
a
convict
and
to
ruin
lucien
s
memory
what
a
desperate
business
said
monsieur
de
granville
there
is
danger
on
every
at
this
instant
the
governor
of
the
conciergerie
came
in
not
without
knocking
and
the
private
room
of
a
public
prosecutor
is
so
well
guarded
that
only
those
concerned
about
the
courts
may
even
knock
at
the
door
monsieur
le
comte
said
monsieur
gault
the
prisoner
calling
himself
carlos
herrera
wishes
to
speak
with
has
he
had
communication
with
anybody
asked
monsieur
de
granville
with
all
the
prisoners
for
he
has
been
out
in
the
yard
since
about
seven
and
he
has
seen
the
condemned
man
who
would
seem
to
have
talked
to
a
speech
of
camusot
s
which
recurred
to
his
mind
like
a
flash
of
light
showed
monsieur
de
granville
all
the
advantage
that
might
be
taken
of
a
confession
of
intimacy
between
jacques
collin
and
theodore
calvi
to
obtain
the
letters
the
public
prosecutor
glad
to
have
an
excuse
for
postponing
the
execution
beckoned
monsieur
gault
to
his
side
i
intend
said
he
to
put
off
the
execution
till
but
let
no
one
in
the
prison
suspect
it
absolute
silence
let
the
executioner
seem
to
be
superintending
the
preparations
send
the
spanish
priest
here
under
a
strong
guard
the
spanish
embassy
claims
his
person
gendarmes
can
bring
up
the
carlos
by
your
back
stairs
so
that
he
may
see
no
one
instruct
the
men
each
to
hold
him
by
one
arm
and
never
let
him
go
till
they
reach
this
door
are
you
sure
monsieur
gault
that
this
dangerous
foreigner
has
spoken
to
no
one
but
the
prisoners
ah
just
as
he
came
out
of
the
condemned
cell
a
lady
came
to
see
him
the
two
magistrates
exchanged
looks
and
such
looks
what
lady
was
that
asked
camusot
one
of
his
penitents
a
marquise
replied
gault
worse
and
worse
said
monsieur
de
granville
looking
at
camusot
she
gave
all
the
gendarmes
and
warders
a
sick
headache
said
monsieur
gault
much
puzzled
nothing
can
be
a
matter
of
indifference
in
your
business
said
the
public
prosecutor
the
conciergerie
has
not
such
tremendous
walls
for
nothing
how
did
this
lady
get
in
with
a
regular
permit
monsieur
replied
the
governor
the
lady
beautifully
dressed
in
a
fine
carriage
with
a
footman
and
a
chasseur
came
to
see
her
confessor
before
going
to
the
funeral
of
the
poor
young
man
whose
body
you
had
had
bring
me
the
order
for
admission
said
monsieur
de
granville
it
was
given
on
the
recommendation
of
the
comte
de
what
was
the
woman
like
asked
the
public
prosecutor
she
seemed
to
be
a
did
you
see
her
face
she
wore
a
black
what
did
they
say
to
each
other
well
a
pious
person
with
a
in
her
hand
what
could
she
say
she
asked
the
abbe
s
blessing
and
went
on
her
did
they
talk
together
a
long
time
not
five
minutes
but
we
none
of
us
understood
what
they
said
they
spoke
spanish
no
tell
us
everything
monsieur
the
public
prosecutor
insisted
i
repeat
the
very
smallest
detail
is
to
us
of
the
first
importance
let
this
be
a
caution
to
she
was
crying
really
weeping
that
we
could
not
see
she
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
she
left
three
hundred
francs
in
gold
for
the
that
was
not
she
said
camusot
at
once
said
she
is
a
thief
said
monsieur
gault
he
knows
the
tribe
said
monsieur
de
get
out
your
warrant
he
added
turning
to
camusot
and
have
seals
placed
on
everything
in
her
house
at
once
but
how
can
she
have
got
hold
of
monsieur
de
serizy
s
recommendation
bring
me
the
order
and
go
monsieur
gault
send
me
that
abbe
immediately
so
long
as
we
have
him
safe
the
danger
can
not
be
greater
and
in
the
course
of
two
hours
talk
you
get
a
long
way
into
a
man
s
especially
such
a
public
prosecutor
as
you
are
said
camusot
insidiously
there
will
be
two
of
us
replied
monsieur
de
granville
politely
and
he
became
discursive
once
more
there
ought
to
be
created
for
every
prison
parlor
a
post
of
superintendent
to
be
given
with
a
good
salary
to
the
cleverest
and
most
energetic
police
officers
said
he
after
a
long
pause
ought
to
end
his
days
in
such
a
place
then
we
should
have
an
eye
and
ear
on
the
watch
in
a
department
that
needs
closer
supervision
than
it
monsieur
gault
could
tell
us
nothing
he
has
so
much
to
do
said
camusot
still
between
these
secret
cells
and
us
there
lies
a
gap
which
ought
not
to
exist
on
the
way
from
the
conciergerie
to
the
judges
rooms
there
are
passages
courtyards
and
stairs
the
attention
of
the
agents
can
not
be
unflagging
whereas
the
prisoner
is
always
alive
to
his
own
affairs
i
was
told
that
a
lady
had
already
placed
herself
in
the
way
of
jacques
collin
when
he
was
brought
up
from
the
cells
to
be
examined
that
woman
got
into
the
guardroom
at
the
top
of
the
narrow
stairs
from
the
mousetrap
the
ushers
told
me
and
i
blamed
the
oh
the
palais
needs
entire
reconstruction
said
monsieur
de
granville
but
it
is
an
outlay
of
twenty
to
thirty
million
francs
just
try
asking
the
chambers
for
thirty
millions
for
the
more
decent
accommodation
of
the
sound
of
many
footsteps
and
a
clatter
of
arms
fell
on
their
ear
it
would
be
jacques
collin
the
public
prosecutor
assumed
a
mask
of
gravity
that
hid
the
man
camusot
imitated
his
chief
the
opened
the
door
and
jacques
collin
came
in
quite
calm
and
unmoved
you
wished
to
speak
to
me
said
monsieur
de
granville
i
am
ready
to
monsieur
le
comte
i
am
jacques
collin
i
surrender
camusot
started
the
public
prosecutor
was
immovable
as
you
may
suppose
i
have
my
reasons
for
doing
this
said
jacques
collin
with
an
ironical
glance
at
the
two
magistrates
i
must
inconvenience
you
greatly
for
if
i
had
remained
a
spanish
priest
you
would
simply
have
packed
me
off
with
an
escort
of
gendarmes
as
far
as
the
frontier
by
bayonne
and
there
spanish
bayonets
would
have
relieved
you
of
the
lawyers
sat
silent
and
imperturbable
monsieur
le
comte
the
convict
went
on
the
reasons
which
have
led
me
to
this
step
are
yet
more
pressing
than
this
but
devilish
personal
to
myself
i
can
tell
them
to
no
one
but
if
you
are
afraid
afraid
of
whom
of
what
said
the
comte
de
granville
in
attitude
and
expression
in
the
turn
of
his
head
his
demeanor
and
his
look
this
distinguished
judge
was
at
this
moment
a
living
embodiment
of
the
law
which
ought
to
supply
us
with
the
noblest
examples
of
civic
courage
in
this
brief
instant
he
was
on
a
level
with
the
magistrates
of
the
old
french
parlement
in
the
time
of
the
civil
wars
when
the
presidents
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
death
and
stood
made
of
marble
like
the
statues
that
commemorate
them
afraid
to
be
alone
with
an
escaped
convict
leave
us
monsieur
camusot
said
the
public
prosecutor
at
once
i
was
about
to
suggest
that
you
should
bind
me
hand
and
foot
jacques
collin
coolly
added
with
an
ominous
glare
at
the
two
gentlemen
he
paused
and
then
said
with
great
gravity
monsieur
le
comte
you
had
my
esteem
but
you
now
command
my
then
you
think
you
are
formidable
said
the
magistrate
with
a
look
of
supreme
contempt
myself
formidable
retorted
the
convict
why
think
about
it
i
am
and
i
know
jacques
collin
took
a
chair
and
sat
down
with
all
the
ease
of
a
man
who
feels
himself
a
match
for
his
adversary
in
an
interview
where
they
would
treat
on
equal
terms
at
this
instant
monsieur
camusot
who
was
on
the
point
of
closing
the
door
behind
him
turned
back
came
up
to
monsieur
de
granville
and
handed
him
two
folded
papers
look
said
he
to
monsieur
de
granville
pointing
to
one
of
them
call
back
monsieur
gault
cried
the
comte
de
granville
as
he
read
the
name
of
madame
de
maufrigneuse
s
maid
a
woman
he
knew
the
governor
of
the
prison
came
in
describe
the
woman
who
came
to
see
the
prisoner
said
the
public
prosecutor
in
his
ear
short
fat
and
square
replied
monsieur
gault
the
woman
to
whom
this
permit
was
given
is
tall
and
thin
said
monsieur
de
granville
how
old
was
she
about
this
concerns
me
gentlemen
said
jacques
collin
come
do
not
puzzle
your
heads
that
person
is
my
aunt
a
very
plausible
aunt
a
woman
and
an
old
woman
i
can
save
you
a
great
deal
of
trouble
you
will
never
find
my
aunt
unless
i
choose
if
we
beat
about
the
bush
we
shall
never
get
monsieur
l
abbe
has
lost
his
spanish
accent
observed
monsieur
gault
he
does
not
speak
broken
because
things
are
in
a
desperate
mess
my
dear
monsieur
gault
replied
jacques
collin
with
a
bitter
smile
as
he
addressed
the
governor
by
name
monsieur
gault
went
quickly
up
to
his
chief
and
said
in
a
whisper
beware
of
that
man
monsieur
le
comte
he
is
mad
with
monsieur
de
granville
gazed
slowly
at
jacques
collin
and
saw
that
he
was
controlling
himself
but
he
saw
too
that
what
the
governor
said
was
true
this
treacherous
demeanor
covered
the
cold
but
terrible
nervous
irritation
of
a
savage
in
jacques
collin
s
eyes
were
the
lurid
fires
of
a
volcanic
eruption
his
fists
were
clenched
he
was
a
tiger
gathering
himself
up
to
spring
leave
us
said
the
count
gravely
to
the
prison
governor
and
the
judge
you
did
wisely
to
send
away
lucien
s
murderer
said
jacques
collin
without
caring
whether
camusot
heard
him
or
no
i
could
not
contain
myself
i
should
have
strangled
monsieur
de
granville
felt
a
chill
never
had
he
seen
a
man
s
eyes
so
full
of
blood
or
cheeks
so
colorless
or
muscles
so
set
and
what
good
would
that
murder
have
done
you
he
quietly
asked
you
avenge
society
or
fancy
you
avenge
it
every
day
monsieur
and
you
ask
me
to
give
a
reason
for
revenge
have
you
never
felt
vengeance
throbbing
in
surges
in
your
veins
don
t
you
know
that
it
was
that
idiot
of
a
judge
who
killed
him
for
you
were
fond
of
my
lucien
and
he
loved
you
i
know
you
by
heart
sir
the
dear
boy
would
tell
me
everything
at
night
when
he
came
in
i
used
to
put
him
to
bed
as
a
nurse
tucks
up
a
child
and
i
made
him
tell
me
everything
he
confided
everything
to
me
even
his
least
sensations
the
best
of
mothers
never
loved
an
only
son
so
tenderly
as
i
loved
that
angel
if
only
you
knew
all
that
is
good
sprang
up
in
his
heart
as
flowers
grow
in
the
fields
he
was
weak
it
was
his
only
fault
weak
as
the
string
of
a
lyre
which
is
so
strong
when
it
is
taut
these
are
the
most
beautiful
natures
their
weakness
is
simply
tenderness
admiration
the
power
of
expanding
in
the
sunshine
of
art
of
love
of
the
beauty
god
has
made
for
man
in
a
thousand
shapes
in
short
lucien
was
a
woman
spoiled
oh
what
could
i
not
say
to
that
brute
beast
who
had
just
gone
out
of
the
room
i
tell
you
monsieur
in
my
degree
as
a
prisoner
before
his
judge
i
did
what
god
a
mighty
would
have
done
for
his
son
if
hoping
to
save
him
he
had
gone
with
him
before
pilate
a
flood
of
tears
fell
from
the
convict
s
light
tawny
eyes
which
just
now
had
glared
like
those
of
a
wolf
starved
by
six
months
snow
in
the
plains
of
the
ukraine
he
went
on
that
dolt
would
listen
to
nothing
and
he
killed
the
boy
i
tell
you
sir
i
bathed
the
child
s
corpse
in
my
tears
crying
out
to
the
power
i
do
not
know
and
which
is
above
us
all
i
who
do
not
believe
in
god
for
if
i
were
not
a
materialist
i
should
not
be
myself
i
have
told
everything
when
i
say
that
you
don
t
know
no
man
knows
what
suffering
is
i
alone
know
it
the
fire
of
anguish
so
dried
up
my
tears
that
all
last
night
i
could
not
weep
now
i
can
because
i
feel
that
you
can
understand
me
i
saw
you
sitting
there
just
now
an
image
of
justice
oh
monsieur
may
god
for
i
am
beginning
to
believe
in
him
preserve
you
from
ever
being
as
bereft
as
i
am
that
cursed
judge
has
robbed
me
of
my
soul
monsieur
le
comte
at
this
moment
they
are
burying
my
life
my
beauty
my
virtue
my
conscience
all
my
powers
imagine
a
dog
from
which
a
chemist
had
extracted
the
that
s
me
i
am
that
dog
and
that
is
why
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
i
am
jacques
collin
and
to
give
myself
up
i
made
up
my
mind
to
it
this
morning
when
they
came
and
carried
away
the
body
i
was
kissing
like
a
madman
like
a
mother
as
the
virgin
must
have
kissed
jesus
in
the
tomb
i
meant
then
to
give
myself
up
to
justice
without
driving
any
bargain
but
now
i
must
make
one
and
you
shall
know
are
you
speaking
to
the
judge
or
to
monsieur
de
granville
asked
the
magistrate
the
two
men
crime
and
law
looked
at
each
other
the
magistrate
had
been
strongly
moved
by
the
convict
he
felt
a
sort
of
divine
pity
for
the
unhappy
wretch
he
understood
what
his
life
and
feelings
were
and
besides
the
magistrate
for
a
magistrate
is
always
a
magistrate
knowing
nothing
of
jacques
collin
s
career
since
his
escape
from
prison
fancied
that
he
could
impress
the
criminal
who
after
all
had
only
been
sentenced
for
forgery
he
would
try
the
effect
of
generosity
on
this
nature
a
compound
like
bronze
of
various
elements
of
good
and
evil
again
monsieur
de
granville
who
had
reached
the
age
of
without
ever
having
been
loved
admired
a
tender
soul
as
all
men
do
who
have
not
been
loved
this
despair
the
lot
of
many
men
to
whom
women
can
only
give
esteem
and
friendship
was
perhaps
the
unknown
bond
on
which
a
strong
intimacy
was
based
that
united
the
comtes
de
bauvan
de
granville
and
de
serizy
for
a
common
misfortune
brings
souls
into
unison
quite
as
much
as
a
common
joy
you
have
the
future
before
you
said
the
public
prosecutor
with
an
inquisitorial
glance
at
the
dejected
villain
the
man
only
expressed
by
a
shrug
the
utmost
indifference
to
his
fate
lucien
made
a
will
by
which
he
leaves
you
three
hundred
thousand
poor
poor
chap
poor
boy
cried
jacques
collin
always
too
honest
i
was
all
wickedness
while
he
was
goodness
noble
beautiful
sublime
such
lovely
souls
can
not
be
spoiled
he
had
taken
nothing
from
me
but
my
money
this
utter
and
complete
surrender
of
his
individuality
which
the
magistrate
vainly
strove
to
rally
so
thoroughly
proved
his
dreadful
words
that
monsieur
de
granville
was
won
over
to
the
criminal
the
public
prosecutor
remained
if
you
really
care
for
nothing
said
monsieur
de
granville
what
did
you
want
to
say
to
me
well
is
it
not
something
that
i
have
given
myself
up
you
were
getting
warm
but
you
had
not
got
me
besides
you
would
not
have
known
what
to
do
with
me
what
an
antagonist
said
the
magistrate
to
himself
monsieur
le
comte
you
are
about
to
cut
off
the
head
of
an
innocent
man
and
i
have
discovered
the
culprit
said
jacques
collin
wiping
away
his
tears
i
have
come
here
not
for
their
sakes
but
for
yours
i
have
come
to
spare
you
remorse
for
i
love
all
who
took
an
interest
in
lucien
just
as
i
will
give
my
hatred
full
play
against
all
who
helped
to
cut
off
his
life
men
or
women
what
can
a
convict
more
or
less
matter
to
me
he
went
on
after
a
short
pause
a
convict
is
no
more
in
my
eyes
than
an
emmet
is
in
yours
i
am
like
the
italian
brigands
fine
men
they
are
if
a
traveler
is
worth
ever
so
little
more
than
the
charge
of
their
musket
they
shoot
him
dead
i
thought
only
of
i
got
the
young
man
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
he
was
bound
to
trust
me
we
had
been
chained
together
theodore
is
very
good
stuff
he
thought
he
was
doing
his
mistress
a
good
turn
by
undertaking
to
sell
or
pawn
stolen
goods
but
he
is
no
more
guilty
of
the
nanterre
job
than
you
are
he
is
a
corsican
it
is
their
way
to
revenge
themselves
and
kill
each
other
like
flies
in
italy
and
spain
a
man
s
life
is
not
respected
and
the
reason
is
plain
there
we
are
believed
to
have
a
soul
in
our
own
image
which
survives
us
and
lives
for
ever
tell
that
to
your
analyst
it
is
only
among
atheistical
or
philosophical
nations
that
those
who
mar
human
life
are
made
to
pay
so
dearly
and
with
reason
from
their
point
of
view
a
belief
only
in
matter
and
in
the
present
if
calvi
had
told
you
who
the
woman
was
from
whom
he
obtained
the
stolen
goods
you
would
not
have
found
the
real
murderer
he
is
already
in
your
hands
but
his
accomplice
whom
poor
theodore
will
not
betray
because
she
is
a
woman
well
every
calling
has
its
point
of
honor
convicts
and
thieves
have
theirs
now
i
know
the
murderer
of
those
two
women
and
the
inventors
of
that
bold
strange
plot
i
have
been
told
every
detail
postpone
calvi
s
execution
and
you
shall
know
all
but
you
must
give
me
your
word
that
he
shall
be
sent
safe
back
to
the
hulks
and
his
punishment
commuted
a
man
so
miserable
as
i
am
does
not
take
the
trouble
to
lie
you
know
that
what
i
have
told
you
is
the
to
you
jacques
collin
though
it
is
degrading
justice
which
ought
never
to
condescend
to
such
a
compromise
i
believe
i
may
relax
the
rigidity
of
my
office
and
refer
the
case
to
my
will
you
grant
me
this
life
monsieur
i
implore
you
to
give
me
your
word
it
will
be
monsieur
granville
drew
himself
up
with
offended
pride
i
hold
in
my
hand
the
honor
of
three
families
and
you
only
the
lives
of
three
convicts
in
yours
said
jacques
collin
i
have
the
stronger
but
you
may
be
sent
back
to
the
dark
cells
then
what
will
you
do
said
the
public
prosecutor
oh
we
are
to
play
the
game
out
then
said
jacques
collin
i
was
speaking
as
man
to
man
i
was
talking
to
monsieur
de
granville
but
if
the
public
prosecutor
is
my
adversary
i
take
up
the
cards
and
hold
them
and
if
only
you
had
given
me
your
word
i
was
ready
to
give
you
back
the
letters
that
mademoiselle
clotilde
de
grandlieu
this
was
said
with
a
tone
an
audacity
and
a
look
which
showed
monsieur
de
granville
that
against
such
an
adversary
the
least
blunder
was
dangerous
and
is
that
all
you
ask
said
the
magistrate
i
will
speak
for
myself
now
said
jacques
the
honor
of
the
grandlieu
family
is
to
pay
for
the
commutation
of
theodore
s
sentence
it
is
giving
much
to
get
very
little
for
what
is
a
convict
in
penal
servitude
for
life
if
he
escapes
you
can
so
easily
settle
the
score
it
is
drawing
a
bill
on
the
guillotine
only
as
he
was
consigned
to
rochefort
with
no
amiable
intentions
you
must
promise
me
that
he
shall
be
quartered
at
toulon
and
well
treated
there
now
for
myself
i
want
something
more
i
have
the
packets
of
letters
from
madame
de
serizy
and
madame
de
and
what
letters
i
tell
you
monsieur
le
comte
prostitutes
when
they
write
letters
assume
a
style
of
sentiment
well
sir
fine
ladies
who
are
accustomed
to
style
and
sentiment
all
day
long
write
as
prostitutes
behave
philosophers
may
know
the
reasons
for
this
contrariness
i
do
not
care
to
seek
them
woman
is
an
inferior
animal
she
is
ruled
by
her
instincts
to
my
mind
a
woman
has
no
beauty
who
is
not
like
a
man
so
your
smart
duchesses
who
are
men
in
brains
only
write
masterpieces
oh
they
are
splendid
from
beginning
to
end
like
piron
s
famous
ode
indeed
would
you
like
to
see
them
said
jacques
collin
with
a
laugh
the
magistrate
felt
ashamed
i
can
not
give
them
to
you
to
read
but
there
no
nonsense
this
is
business
and
all
above
board
i
suppose
you
must
give
me
back
the
letters
and
allow
no
one
to
play
the
spy
or
to
follow
or
to
watch
the
person
who
will
bring
them
to
that
will
take
time
said
monsieur
de
granville
no
it
is
nine
replied
jacques
collin
looking
at
the
clock
well
in
four
minutes
you
will
have
a
letter
from
each
of
these
ladies
and
after
reading
them
you
will
countermand
the
guillotine
if
matters
were
not
as
they
are
you
would
not
see
me
taking
things
so
the
ladies
indeed
have
had
monsieur
de
granville
was
they
must
be
making
a
stir
by
now
they
are
going
to
bring
the
keeper
of
the
seals
into
the
fray
they
may
even
appeal
to
the
king
who
knows
come
now
will
you
give
me
your
word
that
you
will
forget
all
that
has
passed
and
neither
follow
nor
send
any
one
to
follow
that
person
for
a
whole
hour
i
promise
very
well
you
are
not
the
man
to
deceive
an
escaped
convict
you
are
a
chip
of
the
block
of
which
turennes
and
condes
are
made
and
would
keep
your
word
to
a
in
the
des
there
is
at
this
moment
a
beggar
woman
in
rags
an
old
woman
in
the
very
middle
of
the
hall
she
is
probably
gossiping
with
one
of
the
public
writers
about
some
lawsuit
over
a
perhaps
send
your
office
messenger
to
fetch
her
saying
these
words
dabor
ti
mandana
the
boss
wants
you
she
will
come
but
do
not
be
unnecessarily
cruel
either
you
accept
my
terms
or
you
do
not
choose
to
be
mixed
up
in
a
business
with
a
i
am
only
a
forger
you
will
remember
well
do
not
leave
calvi
to
go
through
the
terrors
of
preparation
for
the

have
already
countermanded
the
execution
said
monsieur
de
granville
to
jacques
collin
i
would
not
have
justice
beneath
you
in
jacques
collin
looked
at
the
public
prosecutor
with
a
sort
of
amazement
and
saw
him
ring
his
bell
will
you
promise
not
to
escape
give
me
your
word
and
i
shall
be
satisfied
go
and
fetch
the
the

in
felix
send
away
the
gendarmes
said
monsieur
de
granville
jacques
collin
was
conquered
in
this
duel
with
the
magistrate
he
had
tried
to
be
the
superior
the
stronger
the
more
magnanimous
and
the
magistrate
had
crushed
him
at
the
same
time
the
convict
felt
himself
the
superior
inasmuch
as
he
had
tricked
the
law
he
had
convinced
it
that
the
guilty
man
was
innocent
and
had
fought
for
a
man
s
head
and
won
it
but
this
advantage
must
be
unconfessed
secret
and
hidden
while
the
magistrate
towered
above
him
majestically
in
the
eye
of
day
as
jacques
collin
left
monsieur
de
granville
s
room
the
comte
des
lupeaulx
of
the
president
of
the
council
and
a
deputy
made
his
appearance
and
with
him
a
little
old
man
this
individual
wrapped
in
a
overcoat
as
though
it
were
still
winter
with
powdered
hair
and
a
cold
pale
face
had
a
gouty
gait
unsteady
on
feet
that
were
shod
with
loose
calfskin
boots
leaning
on
a
cane
he
carried
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
wore
a
row
of
seven
orders
in
his
what
is
it
my
dear
des
lupeaulx
asked
the
public
prosecutor
i
come
from
the
prince
replied
the
count
in
a
low
voice
you
have
carte
blanche
if
you
can
only
get
the
letters
madame
de
serizy
s
madame
de
maufrigneuse
s
and
mademoiselle
clotilde
de
grandlieu
s
you
may
come
to
some
arrangement
with
this
gentleman
who
is
he
asked
monsieur
de
granville
in
a
whisper
there
are
no
secrets
between
you
and
me
my
dear
sir
said
des
lupeaulx
this
is
the
famous
corentin
his
majesty
desires
that
you
will
yourself
tell
him
all
the
details
of
this
affair
and
the
conditions
of
do
me
the
kindness
replied
the
public
prosecutor
of
going
to
tell
the
prince
that
the
matter
is
settled
that
i
have
not
needed
this
gentleman
s
assistance
and
he
turned
to
corentin
i
will
wait
on
his
majesty
for
his
commands
with
regard
to
the
last
steps
in
the
matter
which
will
lie
with
the
keeper
of
the
seals
as
two
reprieves
will
need
you
have
been
wise
to
take
the
initiative
said
des
lupeaulx
shaking
hands
with
the
comte
de
granville
on
the
very
eve
of
a
great
undertaking
the
king
is
most
anxious
that
the
peers
and
the
great
families
should
not
be
shown
up
blown
upon
it
ceases
to
be
a
low
criminal
case
it
becomes
an
affair
of
but
tell
the
prince
that
by
the
time
you
came
it
was
all
really
i
believe
then
you
my
dear
fellow
will
be
keeper
of
the
seals
as
soon
as
the
present
keeper
is
made
chancellor
i
have
no
ambition
replied
the
magistrate
des
lupeaulx
laughed
and
went
away
beg
of
the
prince
to
request
the
king
to
grant
me
ten
minutes
audience
at
about
two
added
monsieur
de
granville
as
he
accompanied
the
comte
des
lupeaulx
to
the
door
so
you
are
not
ambitious
said
des
lupeaulx
with
a
keen
look
at
monsieur
de
granville
come
you
have
two
children
you
would
like
at
least
to
be
made
peer
of
if
you
have
the
letters
monsieur
le
procureur
general
my
intervention
is
unnecessary
said
corentin
finding
himself
alone
with
monsieur
de
granville
who
looked
at
him
with
very
natural
curiosity
such
a
man
as
you
can
never
be
superfluous
in
so
delicate
a
case
replied
the
magistrate
seeing
that
corentin
had
heard
or
guessed
everything
corentin
bowed
with
a
patronizing
air
do
you
know
the
man
in
question
monsieur
yes
monsieur
le
comte
it
is
jacques
collin
the
head
of
the
ten
thousand
francs
association
the
banker
for
three
penal
settlements
a
convict
who
for
the
last
five
years
has
succeeded
in
concealing
himself
under
the
robe
of
the
abbe
carlos
herrera
how
he
ever
came
to
be
intrusted
with
a
mission
to
the
late
king
from
the
king
of
spain
is
a
question
which
we
have
all
puzzled
ourselves
with
trying
to
answer
i
am
now
expecting
information
from
madrid
whither
i
have
sent
notes
and
a
man
that
convict
holds
the
secrets
of
two
he
is
a
man
of
mettle
and
temper
we
have
only
two
courses
open
to
us
said
the
public
prosecutor
we
must
secure
his
fidelity
or
get
him
out
of
the
the
same
idea
has
struck
us
both
and
that
is
a
great
honor
for
me
said
corentin
i
am
obliged
to
have
so
many
ideas
and
for
so
many
people
that
out
of
them
all
i
ought
occasionally
to
meet
a
clever
he
spoke
so
drily
and
in
so
icy
a
tone
that
monsieur
de
granville
made
no
reply
and
proceeded
to
attend
to
some
pressing
matters
mademoiselle
jacqueline
collin
s
amazement
on
seeing
jacques
collin
in
the
des
is
beyond
imagining
she
stood
square
on
her
feet
her
hands
on
her
hips
for
she
was
dressed
as
a
costermonger
accustomed
as
she
was
to
her
nephew
s
conjuring
tricks
this
beat
everything
well
if
you
are
going
to
stare
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
natural
history
show
said
jacques
collin
taking
his
aunt
by
the
arm
and
leading
her
out
of
the
hall
we
shall
be
taken
for
a
pair
of
curious
specimens
they
may
take
us
into
custody
and
then
we
should
lose
and
he
went
down
the
stairs
of
the
galerie
marchande
leading
to
the
rue
de
la
barillerie
where
is
paccard
he
is
waiting
for
me
at

walking
up
and
down

of

over
twenty
thousand
francs

to

woman
from
her
lover
after

have
nothing
to
fear
from
me
i
am
staunch
through
thick
and
thin
and

die
without
saying
a
word
that

benefit
of
it
i
promised
your
poor

saturday
and

me
now
and
then
me
and
any
one

stopping
to
think
i
will
never
ask
you
to
do
anything
that

get
you
into
trouble
you
or
your
children
or
your
husband
if
you
get
one
or
your
family
in
my
line
of
life
i
often
want
a
safe
place
to
talk
in
or
to
hide
in
or
i
may
want
a
trusty
woman
to
carry
a
letter
or

an
errand

be
one
of
my
one
of
my
porters

will
find
you
a
husband
and
be
very
useful

thus
the
bargain
was
struck
a
diabolical
compact
like
that
which
had
for
so
long
bound
prudence
servien
to
jacques
collin
and
which
the
man
never
failed
to
tighten
for

had
a
passion
for
recruiting

had
never
had
the
smallest
ground
for
complaint
either
of
jacques
collin
or
of
his
aunt
still
each
time
she
was
required
to
help
them
madame
prelard
quaked
in
every
limb
so
as
she
saw
the
terrible
couple
come
into
her
shop
she
turned
as
pale
as
death
we

fifty
thousand

asked
the
boss
looking
at
them
with
the
clear
penetrating
gaze
which
so
effectually
curdled
the
blood
of
these
tools
of
his
these
ames

when
they
were
caught
tripping
that
they
felt
as
though

the

kind
and
of
your

to
me
what

he
nothing

by

jacques

went
on
if
that
is
where
you
went
to
hide
with
prudence
i
see
paccard
that
you
have
wit
enough
to
dodge
the
reelers
mislead
the
police
but
not
enough
to
puzzle
the
old
lady
and
he
stroked
his
aunt
s
chin
now
i
see
how
she
managed
to
find
it
all
fits
beautifully

said
to
prudence

abbess
at
your
age

worthy
of
a
daughter
of
france
he
added
in
a
hard
tone
prudence
flung
her
arms
round
neck
and
hugged
him
but
the
boss
flung
her
off
with
a
sharp
blow
showing
his
extraordinary
strength
and
but
for
paccard
the
girl

head
would
have
struck
and
broken
the

ways
said
the
boss
stiffly
it
is
disrespectful
to

paccard
why
you
see
it
is
as
though
the
boss
had
made
you
a
present
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
the
shop
is
worth
that
it
is
on

said

t
meddle
in
what
does
not
concern
jacqueline
looked
at
her
nephew
and
was
struck
by
the
alteration
in
his
face
visible
through
the
stern
mask
under
which
the
strong
man
generally
hid
his
feelings

he

jacques

good

cried
paccard
that
is
really
kind
stop

cried
jacques
collin
s
powerful
voice
the
coach

close
to
the
stand

jacques

and

tell
you
how
to
dig
up
the
gold
without
any
risk
it
is
a
ticklish
job
paccard
and
prudence
jumped
out
on
to
the
king
s
highway
as
happy
as
reprieved
thieves
what
a
good
fellow
the
boss
is
said
paccard
he
would
be
the
king
of
men
if
he
were
not
so
rough
on
oh
yes
he
is
a
sweet
creature
said
paccard
did
you
see
how
he
kicked
me
well
we
deserved
to
be
sent
to
old
nick
for
after
all
we
got
him
into
this
if
only
he
does
not
drag
us
into
some
dirty
job
and
get
us
packed
off
to
the
hulks
yet
said
the
wily
prudence
not
he
if
he
had
that
in
his
head
he
would
tell
us
you
don
t
know
he
has
provided
handsomely
for
you
here
we
are
citizens
at
large
oh
when
that
man
takes
a
fancy
to
you
he
has
not
his
match
for
now
my
jewel
said
jacques
collin
to
his
aunt
you
must
take
la
gonore
in
hand
she
must
be
humbugged
five
days
hence
she
will
be
taken
into
custody
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
will
be
found
in
her
rooms
the
remains
of
a
share
from
the
robbery
and
murder
of
the
old
crottat
couple
the
notary
s
father
and
she
will
get
five
years
in
the
madelonnettes
said
jacqueline
that
s
about
it
said
the
nephew
this
will
be
a
reason
for
old
nourrisson
to
get
rid
of
her
house
she
can
not
manage
it
herself
and
a
manager
to
suit
is
not
to
be
found
every
day
you
can
arrange
all
that
we
shall
have
a
sharp
eye
but
all
these
three
things
are
secondary
to
the
business
i
have
undertaken
with
regard
to
our
letters
so
unrip
your
gown
and
give
me
the
samples
of
the
goods
where
are
the
three
packets
at
la
rousse
s
of
coachman
cried
jacques
collin
go
back
to
the
palais
de
justice
and
look
sharp
i
promised
to
be
quick
and
i
have
been
gone
half
an
hour
that
is
too
stay
at
la
rousse
s
and
give
the
sealed
parcels
to
the
office
clerk
who
will
come
and
ask
for
madame
the
will
be
the
password
he
will
say
to
you
madame
i
have
come
from
the
public
prosecutor
for
the
things
you
know
stand
waiting
outside
the
door
staring
about
at
what
is
going
on
in
the
so
as
not
to
arouse
prelard
s
suspicions
as
soon
as
you
have
given
up
the
letters
you
can
start
paccard
and
i
see
what
you
are
at
said
jacqueline
you
mean
to
step
into
s
shoes
that
boy
s
death
has
turned
your
and
there
is
theodore
who
was
just
going
to
have
his
hair
cropped
to
be
scragged
at
four
this
afternoon
cried
jacques
collin
well
it
is
a
notion
we
shall
end
our
days
as
honest
folks
in
a
fine
property
and
a
delightful
climate
in
what
was
to
become
of
me
lucien
has
taken
my
soul
with
him
and
all
my
joy
in
life
i
have
thirty
years
before
me
to
be
sick
of
life
in
and
i
have
no
heart
left
instead
of
being
the
boss
of
the
hulks
i
shall
be
a
figaro
of
the
law
and
avenge
lucien
i
can
never
be
sure
of
demolishing
corentin
excepting
in
the
skin
of
a
police
agent
and
so
long
as
i
have
a
man
to
devour
i
shall
still
feel
the
profession
a
man
follows
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
is
a
mere
sham
the
reality
is
in
the
idea
he
added
striking
his
how
much
have
we
left
in
the
he
asked
nothing
said
his
aunt
dismayed
by
the
man
s
tone
and
manner
i
gave
you
all
i
had
for
the
boy
la
romette
has
not
more
than
twenty
thousand
francs
left
in
the
business
i
took
everything
from
madame
nourrisson
she
had
about
sixty
thousand
francs
of
her
own
oh
we
are
lying
in
sheets
that
have
been
washed
this
twelve
months
past
that
boy
had
all
the
pals
blunt
our
savings
and
all
old
nourrisson
making
five
hundred
and
sixty
we
have
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
which
paccard
and
prudence
will
pay
us
i
will
tell
you
where
to
find
two
hundred
thousand
more
the
remainder
will
come
to
me
out
of
esther
s
money
we
must
repay
old
nourrisson
with
theodore
paccard
prudence
nourrisson
and
you
i
shall
soon
have
the
holy
alliance
i
listen
now
we
are
nearly
there
here
are
the
three
letters
said
jacqueline
who
had
finished
unsewing
the
lining
of
her
gown
quite
right
said
jacques
collin
taking
the
three
precious
documents
autograph
letters
on
vellum
paper
and
still
strongly
scented
theodore
did
the
nanterre
oh
it
was
don
t
talk
time
is
precious
he
wanted
to
give
the
proceeds
to
a
little
corsican
sparrow
named
ginetta
you
must
set
old
nourrisson
to
find
her
i
will
give
you
the
necessary
information
in
a
letter
which
gault
will
give
you
come
for
it
to
the
gate
of
the
conciergerie
in
two
hours
time
you
must
place
the
girl
with
a
washerwoman
godet
s
sister
she
must
seem
at
home
there
godet
and
ruffard
were
concerned
with
la
pouraille
in
robbing
and
murdering
the
crottats
the
four
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
are
all
safe
in
la
gonore
s
cellar
la
pouraille
s
share
the
second
third
in
la
gonore
s
bedroom
which
is
ruffard
s
and
the
rest
is
hidden
in
godet
s
sister
s
house
we
will
begin
by
taking
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
out
of
la
pouraille
s
whack
a
hundred
thousand
of
godet
s
and
a
hundred
thousand
of
ruffard
s
as
soon
as
godet
and
ruffard
are
nabbed
they
will
be
supposed
to
have
got
rid
of
what
is
missing
from
their
shares
and
i
will
make
godet
believe
that
i
have
saved
a
hundred
thousand
francs
for
him
and
that
la
gonore
has
done
the
same
for
la
pouraille
and
ruffard
prudence
and
paccard
will
do
the
job
at
la
gonore
s
you
and
ginetta
who
seems
to
be
a
smart
hussy
must
manage
the
job
at
godet
s
sister
s
place
and
so
as
the
first
act
in
the
farce
i
can
enable
the
public
prosecutor
to
lay
his
hands
on
four
hundred
thousand
francs
stolen
from
the
crottats
and
on
the
guilty
parties
then
i
shall
seem
to
have
shown
up
the
nanterre
murderer
we
shall
get
back
our
shiners
and
are
behind
the
scenes
with
the
police
we
were
the
game
now
we
are
the
hunters
that
is
all
give
the
driver
three
the
coach
was
at
the
palais
jacqueline
speechless
with
astonishment
paid
went
up
the
steps
to
the
public
prosecutor
s
room
a
complete
change
of
life
is
so
violent
a
crisis
that
jacques
collin
in
spite
of
his
resolution
mounted
the
steps
but
slowly
going
up
from
the
rue
de
la
barillerie
to
the
galerie
marchande
where
under
the
gloomy
peristyle
of
the
courthouse
is
the
entrance
to
the
court
itself
some
civil
case
was
going
on
which
had
brought
a
little
crowd
together
at
the
foot
of
the
double
stairs
leading
to
the
assize
court
so
that
the
convict
lost
in
thought
stood
for
some
minutes
checked
by
the
throng
to
the
left
of
this
double
flight
is
one
of
the
mainstays
of
the
building
like
an
enormous
pillar
and
in
this
tower
is
a
little
door
this
door
opens
on
a
spiral
staircase
down
to
the
conciergerie
to
which
the
public
prosecutor
the
governor
of
the
prison
the
presiding
judges
king
s
council
and
the
chief
of
the
safety
department
have
access
by
this
back
way
it
was
up
a
side
staircase
from
this
now
walled
up
that
marie
antoinette
the
queen
of
france
was
led
before
the
revolutionary
tribunal
which
sat
as
we
all
know
in
the
great
hall
where
appeals
are
now
heard
before
the
supreme
court
the
heart
sinks
within
us
at
the
sight
of
these
dreadful
steps
when
we
think
that
marie
therese
s
daughter
whose
suite
and
and
hoops
filled
the
great
staircase
at
versailles
once
passed
that
way
perhaps
it
was
in
expiation
of
her
mother
s
crime
the
atrocious
division
of
poland
the
sovereigns
who
commit
such
crimes
evidently
never
think
of
the
retribution
to
be
exacted
by
providence
when
jacques
collin
went
up
the
vaulted
stairs
to
the
public
prosecutor
s
room
was
just
coming
out
of
the
little
door
in
the
wall
the
chief
of
the
safety
had
come
from
the
conciergerie
and
was
also
going
up
to
monsieur
de
granville
it
was
easy
to
imagine
s
surprise
when
he
recognized
in
front
of
him
the
gown
of
carlos
herrera
which
he
had
so
thoroughly
studied
that
morning
he
ran
on
to
pass
him
jacques
collin
turned
round
and
the
enemies
were
face
to
face
each
stood
still
and
the
look
flashed
in
both
pairs
of
eyes
so
different
in
themselves
as
in
a
duel
two
pistols
go
off
at
the
same
instant
this
time
i
have
got
you
rascal
said
the
chief
of
the
safety
department
ah
ha
replied
jacques
collin
ironically
it
flashed
through
his
mind
that
monsieur
de
granville
had
sent
some
one
to
watch
him
and
strange
to
say
it
pained
him
to
think
the
magistrate
less
magnanimous
than
he
had
supposed
bravely
flew
at
jacques
collin
s
throat
but
he
keeping
his
eye
on
the
foe
gave
him
a
straight
blow
and
sent
him
sprawling
on
his
back
three
yards
off
then
went
calmly
up
to
and
held
out
a
hand
to
help
him
rise
exactly
like
an
english
boxer
who
sure
of
his
superiority
is
ready
for
more
knew
better
than
to
call
out
but
he
sprang
to
his
feet
ran
to
the
entrance
to
the
passage
and
signed
to
a
gendarme
to
stand
on
guard
then
swift
as
lightning
he
came
back
to
the
foe
who
quietly
looked
on
jacques
collin
had
decided
what
to
do
either
the
public
prosecutor
has
broken
his
word
or
he
had
not
taken
into
his
confidence
and
in
that
case
i
must
get
the
matter
explained
thought
do
you
mean
to
arrest
me
he
asked
his
enemy
say
so
without
more
ado
don
t
i
know
that
in
the
heart
of
this
place
you
are
stronger
than
i
am
i
could
kill
you
with
a
kick
but
i
could
not
tackle
the
gendarmes
and
the
soldiers
now
make
no
noise
where
to
you
want
to
take
me
to
monsieur
come
along
to
monsieur
camusot
replied
jacques
collin
why
should
we
not
go
to
the
public
prosecutor
s
court
it
is
nearer
he
added
who
knew
that
he
was
out
of
favor
with
the
upper
ranks
of
judicial
authorities
and
suspected
of
having
made
a
fortune
at
the
expense
of
criminals
and
their
victims
was
not
unwilling
to
show
himself
in
court
with
so
notable
a
capture
all
right
we
will
go
there
said
he
but
as
you
surrender
allow
me
to
fit
you
with
bracelets
i
am
afraid
of
your
and
he
took
the
handcuffs
out
of
his
pocket
jacques
collin
held
out
his
hands
and
snapped
on
the
manacles
well
now
since
you
are
feeling
so
good
said
he
tell
me
how
you
got
out
of
the
conciergerie
by
the
way
you
came
down
the
turret
then
have
you
taught
the
gendarmes
some
new
trick
no
monsieur
de
granville
let
me
out
on
you
are
gammoning
me
you
will
see
perhaps
it
will
be
your
turn
to
wear
the
just
then
corentin
was
saying
to
monsieur
de
granville
well
monsieur
it
is
just
an
hour
since
our
man
set
out
are
you
not
afraid
that
he
may
have
fooled
you
he
is
on
the
road
to
spain
perhaps
by
this
time
and
we
shall
not
find
him
there
for
spain
is
a
whimsical
kind
of
either
i
know
nothing
of
men
or
he
will
come
back
he
is
bound
by
every
interest
he
has
more
to
look
for
at
my
hands
than
he
has
to
walked
in
monsieur
le
comte
said
he
i
have
good
news
for
you
jacques
collin
who
had
escaped
has
been
and
this
said
jacques
collin
addressing
monsieur
de
granville
is
the
way
you
keep
your
word
ask
your
agent
where
he
took
where
said
the
public
prosecutor
close
to
the
court
in
the
vaulted
passage
said
take
your
irons
off
the
man
said
monsieur
de
granville
sternly
and
remember
that
you
are
to
leave
him
free
till
further
go
you
have
a
way
of
moving
and
acting
as
if
you
alone
were
law
and
police
in
the
public
prosecutor
turned
his
back
on
who
became
deadly
pale
especially
at
a
look
from
jacques
collin
in
which
he
read
disaster
i
have
not
been
out
of
this
room
i
expected
you
back
and
you
can
not
doubt
that
i
have
kept
my
word
as
you
kept
yours
said
monsieur
de
granville
to
the
convict
for
a
moment
i
did
doubt
you
sir
and
in
my
place
perhaps
you
would
have
thought
as
i
did
but
on
reflection
i
saw
that
i
was
unjust
i
bring
you
more
than
you
can
give
me
you
had
no
interest
in
betraying
the
magistrate
flashed
a
look
at
corentin
this
glance
which
could
not
escape
who
was
watching
monsieur
de
granville
directed
his
attention
to
the
strange
little
old
man
sitting
in
an
armchair
in
a
corner
warned
at
once
by
the
swift
and
anxious
instinct
that
scents
the
presence
of
an
enemy
collin
examined
this
figure
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
eyes
were
not
so
old
as
the
costume
would
suggest
and
he
detected
a
disguise
in
one
second
jacques
collin
was
revenged
on
corentin
for
the
rapid
insight
with
which
corentin
had
unmasked
him
at
peyrade
s
we
are
not
alone
said
jacques
collin
to
monsieur
de
granville
no
said
the
magistrate
drily
and
this
gentleman
is
one
of
my
oldest
acquaintances
i
believe
replied
the
convict
he
went
forward
recognizing
corentin
the
real
and
confessed
originator
of
lucien
s
overthrow
jacques
collin
whose
face
was
of
a
hue
for
a
scarcely
perceptible
moment
turned
white
almost
ashy
all
his
blood
rushed
to
his
heart
so
furious
and
maddening
was
his
longing
to
spring
on
this
dangerous
reptile
and
crush
it
but
he
controlled
the
brutal
impulse
suppressing
it
with
the
force
that
made
him
so
formidable
he
put
on
a
polite
manner
and
the
tone
of
obsequious
civility
which
he
had
practised
since
assuming
the
garb
of
a
priest
of
a
superior
order
and
he
bowed
to
the
little
old
man
monsieur
corentin
said
he
do
i
owe
the
pleasure
of
this
meeting
to
chance
or
am
i
so
happy
as
to
be
the
cause
of
your
visit
here
monsieur
de
granville
s
astonishment
was
at
its
height
and
he
could
not
help
staring
at
the
two
men
who
had
thus
come
face
to
face
jacques
collin
s
behavior
and
the
tone
in
which
he
spoke
denoted
a
crisis
and
he
was
curious
to
know
the
meaning
of
it
on
being
thus
suddenly
and
miraculously
recognized
corentin
drew
himself
up
like
a
snake
when
you
tread
on
its
tail
yes
it
is
i
my
dear
abbe
carlos
and
are
you
here
said
to
interfere
between
monsieur
the
public
prosecutor
and
me
am
i
so
happy
as
to
be
the
object
of
one
of
those
negotiations
in
which
your
talents
shine
so
brightly
here
monsieur
le
comte
the
convict
went
on
not
to
waste
time
so
precious
as
yours
is
read
these
they
are
samples
of
my
and
he
held
out
to
monsieur
de
granville
three
letters
which
he
took
out
of
his
and
while
you
are
studying
them
i
will
with
your
permission
have
a
little
talk
with
this
you
do
me
great
honor
said
corentin
who
could
not
help
giving
a
little
shiver
you
achieved
a
perfect
success
in
our
business
said
jacques
collin
i
was
beaten
he
added
lightly
in
the
tone
of
a
gambler
who
has
lost
his
money
but
you
left
some
men
on
the
field
your
victory
cost
you
yes
said
corentin
taking
up
the
jest
you
lost
your
queen
and
i
lost
my
two
oh
contenson
was
a
mere
pawn
said
jacques
collin
scornfully
you
may
easily
replace
him
you
really
are
allow
me
to
praise
you
to
your
face
you
are
on
my
word
of
honor
a
magnificent
no
no
i
bow
to
your
superiority
replied
corentin
assuming
the
air
of
a
professional
joker
as
if
he
said
if
you
mean
humbug
by
all
means
humbug
i
have
everything
at
my
command
while
you
are
so
to
oh
oh
said
jacques
collin
and
you
were
very
near
winning
the
day
said
corentin
noticing
the
exclamation
you
are
quite
the
most
extraordinary
man
i
ever
met
in
my
life
and
i
have
seen
many
very
extraordinary
men
for
those
i
have
to
work
with
me
are
all
remarkable
for
daring
and
bold
scheming
i
was
for
my
sins
very
intimate
with
the
late
duc
d
otranto
i
have
worked
for
louis
xviii
when
he
was
on
the
throne
and
when
he
was
exiled
for
the
emperor
and
for
the
directory
you
have
the
tenacity
of
louvel
the
best
political
instrument
i
ever
met
with
but
you
are
as
supple
as
the
prince
of
diplomates
and
what
auxiliaries
you
have
i
would
give
many
a
head
to
the
guillotine
if
i
could
have
in
my
service
the
cook
who
lived
with
poor
little
and
where
do
you
find
such
beautiful
creatures
as
the
woman
who
took
the
jewess
place
for
monsieur
de
nucingen
i
don
t
know
where
to
get
them
when
i
want
monsieur
monsieur
you
overpower
me
said
jacques
collin
such
praise
from
you
will
turn
my
head
it
is
deserved
why
you
took
in
peyrade
he
believed
you
to
be
a
police
officer
he
i
tell
you
what
if
you
had
not
that
fool
of
a
boy
to
take
care
of
you
would
have
thrashed
oh
monsieur
but
you
are
forgetting
contenson
disguised
as
a
mulatto
and
peyrade
as
an
englishman
actors
have
the
stage
to
help
them
but
to
be
so
perfect
by
daylight
and
at
all
hours
no
one
but
you
and
your
men
come
now
said
corentin
we
are
fully
convinced
of
our
worth
and
merits
and
here
we
stand
each
of
us
quite
alone
i
have
lost
my
old
friend
you
your
young
companion
i
for
the
moment
am
in
the
stronger
position
why
should
we
not
do
like
the
men
in
auberge
des
i
offer
you
my
hand
and
say
let
us
embrace
and
let
bygones
be
here
in
the
presence
of
monsieur
le
comte
i
propose
to
give
you
full
and
plenary
absolution
and
you
shall
be
one
of
my
men
the
chief
next
to
me
and
perhaps
my
you
really
offer
me
a
situation
said
jacques
collin
a
nice
situation
indeed
out
of
the
fire
into
the
you
will
be
in
a
sphere
where
your
talents
will
be
highly
appreciated
and
well
paid
for
and
you
will
act
at
your
ease
the
government
police
are
not
free
from
perils
i
as
you
see
me
have
already
been
imprisoned
twice
but
i
am
none
the
worse
for
that
and
we
travel
we
are
what
we
choose
to
appear
we
pull
the
wires
of
political
dramas
and
are
treated
with
politeness
by
very
great
come
my
dear
jacques
collin
do
you
say
yes
have
you
orders
to
act
in
this
matter
said
the
convict
i
have
a
free
hand
replied
corentin
delighted
at
his
own
happy
idea
you
are
trifling
with
me
you
are
very
shrewd
and
you
must
allow
that
a
man
may
be
suspicious
of
you
have
sold
more
than
one
man
by
tying
him
up
in
a
sack
after
making
him
go
into
it
of
his
own
accord
i
know
all
your
great
victories
the
montauran
case
the
simeuse
business
the
battles
of
marengo
of
well
said
corentin
you
have
some
esteem
for
the
public
prosecutor
yes
said
jacques
collin
bowing
respectfully
i
admire
his
noble
character
his
firmness
his
dignity
i
would
give
my
life
to
make
him
happy
indeed
to
begin
with
i
will
put
an
end
to
the
dangerous
condition
in
which
madame
de
serizy
now
monsieur
de
granville
turned
to
him
with
a
look
of
satisfaction
then
ask
him
corentin
went
on
if
i
have
not
full
power
to
snatch
you
from
the
degrading
position
in
which
you
stand
and
to
attach
you
to
it
is
quite
true
said
monsieur
de
granville
watching
the
convict
really
and
truly
i
may
have
absolution
for
the
past
and
a
promise
of
succeeding
to
you
if
i
give
sufficient
evidence
of
my
intelligence
between
two
such
men
as
we
are
there
can
be
no
misunderstanding
said
corentin
with
a
lordly
air
that
might
have
taken
anybody
in
and
the
price
of
the
bargain
is
i
suppose
the
surrender
of
those
three
packets
of
letters
said
jacques
collin
i
did
not
think
it
would
be
necessary
to
say
so
to
you
my
dear
monsieur
corentin
said
with
irony
worthy
of
that
which
made
the
fame
of
talma
in
the
part
of
nicomede
i
beg
to
decline
i
am
indebted
to
you
for
the
knowledge
of
what
i
am
worth
and
of
the
importance
you
attach
to
seeing
me
deprived
of
my
weapons
i
will
never
forget
it
at
all
times
and
for
ever
i
shall
be
at
your
service
but
instead
of
saying
with
robert
macaire
let
us
embrace
i
embrace
he
seized
corentin
round
the
middle
so
suddenly
that
the
other
could
not
avoid
the
hug
he
clutched
him
to
his
heart
like
a
doll
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
carried
him
like
a
feather
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
opened
the
door
and
then
set
him
down
outside
quite
battered
by
this
rough
treatment
my
dear
fellow
said
jacques
collin
in
a
low
voice
and
in
corentin
s
ear
the
length
of
three
corpses
parts
you
from
me
we
have
measured
swords
they
are
of
the
same
temper
and
the
same
length
let
us
treat
each
other
with
due
respect
but
i
mean
to
be
your
equal
not
your
subordinate
armed
as
you
would
be
it
strikes
me
you
would
be
too
dangerous
a
general
for
your
lieutenant
we
will
place
a
grave
between
us
woe
to
you
if
you
come
over
on
to
my
territory
you
call
yourself
the
state
as
footmen
call
themselves
by
their
master
s
names
for
my
part
i
will
call
myself
justice
we
shall
often
meet
let
us
treat
each
other
with
dignity
and
propriety
all
the
more
because
we
shall
always
remain
atrocious
blackguards
he
added
in
a
whisper
i
set
you
the
example
by
embracing
you
corentin
stood
nonplussed
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
allowed
his
terrible
antagonist
to
wring
his
hand
if
so
said
he
i
think
it
will
be
to
our
interest
on
both
sides
to
remain
we
shall
be
stronger
each
on
our
own
side
but
at
the
same
time
more
dangerous
added
jacques
collin
in
an
undertone
and
you
will
allow
me
to
call
on
you
to
ask
for
some
pledge
of
our
well
well
said
corentin
amiably
you
are
taking
the
case
out
of
my
hands
to
place
it
in
those
of
the
public
prosecutor
you
will
help
him
to
promotion
but
i
can
not
but
own
to
you
that
you
are
acting
is
too
well
known
he
has
served
his
turn
if
you
get
his
place
you
will
have
the
only
situation
that
suits
you
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
in
it
on
my
honor
till
our
next
meeting
very
soon
said
jacques
collin
on
turning
round
saw
the
public
prosecutor
sitting
at
his
table
his
head
resting
on
his
hands
do
you
mean
that
you
can
save
the
comtesse
de
serizy
from
going
mad
asked
monsieur
de
granville
in
five
minutes
said
jacques
collin
and
you
can
give
me
all
those
ladies
letters
have
you
read
the
three
yes
said
the
magistrate
vehemently
and
i
blush
for
the
women
who
wrote
well
we
are
now
alone
admit
no
one
and
let
us
come
to
terms
said
jacques
collin
excuse
me
justice
must
first
take
its
course
monsieur
camusot
has
instructions
to
seize
your
he
will
never
find
her
said
jacques
collin
search
is
to
be
made
at
the
temple
in
the
shop
of
a
demoiselle
paccard
who
superintends
her
nothing
will
be
found
there
but
rags
costumes
diamonds
uniforms
however
it
will
be
as
well
to
check
monsieur
camusot
s
monsieur
de
granville
rang
and
sent
an
office
messenger
to
desire
monsieur
camusot
to
come
and
speak
with
him
now
said
he
to
jacques
collin
an
end
to
all
this
i
want
to
know
your
recipe
for
curing
the
monsieur
le
comte
said
the
convict
very
gravely
i
was
as
you
know
sentenced
to
five
years
penal
servitude
for
forgery
but
i
love
my
this
passion
like
every
other
had
defeated
its
own
end
for
lovers
who
insist
on
adoring
each
other
too
fondly
end
by
quarreling
by
dint
of
escaping
and
being
recaptured
alternately
i
have
served
seven
years
on
the
hulks
so
you
have
nothing
to
remit
but
the
added
terms
i
earned
in
quod
i
beg
pardon
in
prison
i
have
in
fact
served
my
time
and
till
some
ugly
job
can
be
proved
against
me
which
i
defy
justice
to
do
or
even
corentin
i
ought
to
be
reinstated
in
my
rights
as
a
french
citizen
what
is
life
if
i
am
banned
from
paris
and
subject
to
the
eye
of
the
police
where
can
i
go
what
can
i
do
you
know
my
capabilities
you
have
seen
corentin
that
storehouse
of
treachery
and
wile
turn
ghastly
pale
before
me
and
doing
justice
to
my
that
man
has
bereft
me
of
everything
for
it
was
he
and
he
alone
who
overthrew
the
edifice
of
lucien
s
fortunes
by
what
means
and
in
whose
interest
i
know
corentin
and
camusot
did
it
all
no
recriminations
said
monsieur
de
granville
give
me
the
well
then
these
are
the
facts
last
night
as
i
held
in
my
hand
the
icy
hand
of
that
dead
youth
i
vowed
to
myself
that
i
would
give
up
the
mad
contest
i
have
kept
up
for
twenty
years
past
against
society
at
large
you
will
not
believe
me
capable
of
religious
sentimentality
after
what
i
have
said
of
my
religious
opinions
still
in
these
twenty
years
i
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
seamy
side
of
the
world
i
have
known
its
and
i
have
discerned
in
the
march
of
events
a
power
which
you
call
providence
and
i
call
chance
and
which
my
companions
call
luck
every
evil
deed
however
quickly
it
may
hide
its
traces
is
overtaken
by
some
retribution
in
this
struggle
for
existence
when
the
game
is
going
well
when
you
have
quint
and
quartorze
in
your
hand
and
the
lead
the
candle
tumbles
over
and
the
cards
are
burned
or
the
player
has
a
fit
of
apoplexy
that
is
lucien
s
story
that
boy
that
angel
had
not
committed
the
shadow
of
a
crime
he
let
himself
be
led
he
let
things
go
he
was
to
marry
mademoiselle
de
grandlieu
to
be
made
marquis
he
had
a
fine
fortune
well
a
prostitute
poisons
herself
she
hides
the
price
of
a
certificate
of
stock
and
the
whole
structure
so
laboriously
built
up
crumbles
in
an
instant
and
who
is
the
first
man
to
deal
a
blow
a
man
loaded
with
secret
infamy
a
monster
who
in
the
world
of
finance
has
committed
such
crimes
that
every
coin
of
his
vast
fortune
has
been
dipped
in
the
tears
of
a
whole
family
see
maison
by
nucingen
who
has
been
a
legalized
jacques
collin
in
the
world
of
money
however
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
all
the
bankruptcies
and
tricks
for
which
that
man
deserves
hanging
my
fetters
will
leave
a
mark
on
all
my
actions
however
virtuous
to
be
a
shuttlecock
between
two
racquets
one
called
the
hulks
and
the
other
the
police
is
a
life
in
which
success
means
toil
and
peace
and
quiet
seem
quite
impossible
at
this
moment
monsieur
de
granville
jacques
collin
is
buried
with
lucien
who
is
being
now
sprinkled
with
holy
water
and
carried
away
to
what
i
want
is
a
place
not
to
live
in
but
to
die
in
as
things
are
you
representing
justice
have
never
cared
to
make
the
released
convict
s
social
status
a
concern
of
any
interest
though
the
law
may
be
satisfied
society
is
not
society
is
still
suspicious
and
does
all
it
can
to
justify
its
suspicions
it
regards
a
released
convict
as
an
impossible
creature
it
ought
to
restore
him
to
his
full
rights
but
in
fact
it
prohibits
his
living
in
certain
circles
society
says
to
the
poor
wretch
paris
which
is
the
only
place
you
can
be
hidden
in
paris
and
its
suburbs
for
so
many
miles
round
is
the
forbidden
land
you
shall
not
live
there
and
it
subjects
the
convict
to
the
watchfulness
of
the
police
do
you
think
that
life
is
possible
under
such
conditions
to
live
the
convict
must
work
for
he
does
not
come
out
of
prison
with
a
fortune
you
arrange
matters
so
that
he
is
plainly
ticketed
recognized
hedged
round
and
then
you
fancy
that
his
will
trust
him
when
society
and
justice
and
the
world
around
him
do
not
you
condemn
him
to
starvation
or
crime
he
can
not
get
work
and
is
inevitably
dragged
into
his
old
ways
which
lead
to
the
scaffold
thus
while
earnestly
wishing
to
give
up
this
struggle
with
the
law
i
could
find
no
place
for
myself
under
the
sun
one
course
alone
is
open
to
me
that
is
to
become
the
servant
of
the
power
that
crushes
us
and
as
soon
as
this
idea
dawned
on
me
the
power
of
which
i
spoke
was
shown
in
the
clearest
light
three
great
families
are
at
my
mercy
do
not
suppose
i
am
thinking
of
blackmail
blackmail
is
the
meanest
form
of
murder
in
my
eyes
it
is
baser
villainy
than
murder
the
murderer
needs
at
any
rate
atrocious
courage
and
i
practise
what
i
preach
for
the
letters
which
are
my
which
allow
me
to
address
you
thus
and
for
the
moment
place
me
on
an
equality
with
you
i
crime
and
you
justice
those
letters
are
in
your
power
your
messenger
may
fetch
them
and
they
will
be
given
up
to
him
i
ask
no
price
for
them
i
do
not
sell
them
alas
monsieur
le
comte
i
was
not
thinking
of
myself
when
i
preserved
them
i
thought
that
lucien
might
some
day
be
in
danger
if
you
can
not
agree
to
my
request
my
courage
is
out
i
hate
life
more
than
enough
to
make
me
blow
out
my
own
brains
and
rid
you
of
me
or
with
a
passport
i
can
go
to
america
and
live
in
the
wilderness
i
have
all
the
characteristics
of
a
savage
these
are
the
thoughts
that
came
to
me
in
the
your
clerk
no
doubt
carried
you
a
message
i
sent
by
him
when
i
saw
what
precautions
you
took
to
save
lucien
s
memory
from
any
stain
i
dedicated
my
life
to
you
a
poor
offering
for
i
no
longer
cared
for
it
it
seemed
to
me
impossible
without
the
star
that
gave
it
light
the
happiness
that
glorified
it
the
thought
that
gave
it
meaning
the
prosperity
of
the
young
poet
who
was
its
sun
and
i
determined
to
give
you
the
three
packets
of
letters
monsieur
de
granville
bowed
his
head
i
went
down
into
the
and
there
i
found
the
persons
guilty
of
the
nanterre
crime
as
well
as
my
little
chain
companion
within
an
inch
of
the
chopper
as
an
involuntary
accessory
after
the
fact
jacques
collin
went
on
i
discovered
that
is
cheating
the
authorities
that
one
of
his
men
murdered
the
crottats
was
not
this
providential
as
you
say
so
i
perceived
a
remote
possibility
of
doing
good
of
turning
my
gifts
and
the
dismal
experience
i
have
gained
to
account
for
the
benefit
of
society
of
being
useful
instead
of
mischievous
and
i
ventured
to
confide
in
your
judgment
your
the
man
s
air
of
candor
of
artlessness
of
childlike
simplicity
as
he
made
his
confession
without
bitterness
or
that
philosophy
of
vice
which
had
hitherto
made
him
so
terrible
to
hear
was
like
an
absolute
transformation
he
was
no
longer
himself
i
have
such
implicit
trust
in
you
he
went
on
with
the
humility
of
a
penitent
that
i
am
wholly
at
your
mercy
you
see
me
with
three
roads
open
to
me
suicide
america
and
the
rue
de
jerusalem
is
rich
he
has
served
his
turn
he
is
a
rascal
and
if
you
set
me
to
work
against
him
i
would
catch
him
in
some
trick
within
a
week
if
you
will
put
me
in
that
sneak
s
shoes
you
will
do
society
a
real
service
i
will
be
honest
i
have
every
quality
that
is
needed
in
the
profession
i
am
better
educated
than
i
went
through
my
schooling
up
to
rhetoric
i
shall
not
blunder
as
he
does
i
have
very
good
manners
when
i
choose
my
sole
ambition
is
to
become
an
instrument
of
order
and
repression
instead
of
being
the
incarnation
of
corruption
i
will
enlist
no
more
recruits
to
the
army
of
vice
in
war
monsieur
when
a
hostile
general
is
captured
he
is
not
shot
you
know
his
sword
is
returned
to
him
and
his
prison
is
a
large
town
well
i
am
the
general
of
the
hulks
and
i
have
i
am
beaten
not
by
the
law
but
by
death
the
sphere
in
which
i
crave
to
live
and
act
is
the
only
one
that
is
suited
to
me
and
there
i
can
develop
the
powers
i
feel
within
me
and
jacques
collin
stood
in
an
attitude
of
diffident
submission
you
place
the
letters
in
my
hands
then
said
the
public
prosecutor
you
have
only
to
send
for
them
they
will
be
delivered
to
your
but
how
jacques
collin
read
the
magistrate
s
mind
and
kept
up
the
game
you
promised
me
to
commute
the
capital
sentence
on
calvi
for
twenty
years
penal
servitude
oh
i
am
not
reminding
you
of
that
to
drive
a
bargain
he
added
eagerly
seeing
monsieur
de
granville
s
expression
that
life
should
be
safe
for
other
reasons
the
lad
is
innocent
how
am
i
to
get
the
letters
asked
the
public
prosecutor
it
is
my
right
and
my
business
to
convince
myself
that
you
are
the
man
you
say
you
are
i
must
have
you
without
send
a
man
you
can
trust
to
the
flower
market
on
the
quay
at
the
door
of
a
tinman
s
shop
under
the
sign
of
achilles
shield
that
house
yes
said
jacques
collin
smiling
bitterly
my
shield
is
your
man
will
see
an
old
woman
dressed
as
i
told
you
before
like
a
who
has
saved
money
earrings
in
her
ears
and
clothes
like
a
rich
s
he
must
ask
for
madame
de
do
not
omit
the
de
and
he
must
say
i
have
come
from
the
public
prosecutor
to
fetch
you
know
you
will
immediately
receive
three
sealed
all
the
letters
are
there
said
monsieur
de
granville
there
is
no
tricking
you
you
did
not
get
your
place
for
nothing
said
jacques
collin
with
a
smile
i
see
you
still
think
me
capable
of
testing
you
and
giving
you
so
much
blank
no
you
do
not
know
me
said
he
i
trust
you
as
a
son
trusts
his
you
will
be
taken
back
to
the
conciergerie
said
the
magistrate
and
there
await
a
decision
as
to
your
monsieur
de
granville
rang
and
said
to
the
who
answered
beg
monsieur
garnery
to
come
here
if
he
is
in
his
besides
the
police
commissioners
who
watch
over
paris
like
petty
providences
to
say
nothing
of
the
guardians
of
public
safety
and
who
have
earned
the
nickname
of
quart
d
oeil
in
thieves
slang
a
quarter
of
an
eye
because
there
are
four
of
them
to
each
district
besides
these
there
are
two
commissioners
attached
equally
to
the
police
and
to
the
legal
authorities
whose
duty
it
is
to
undertake
delicate
negotiation
and
not
frequently
to
serve
as
deputies
to
the
examining
judges
the
office
of
these
two
magistrates
for
police
commissioners
are
also
magistrates
is
known
as
the
delegates
office
for
they
are
in
fact
delegated
on
each
occasion
and
formally
empowered
to
carry
out
inquiries
or
arrests
these
functions
demand
men
of
ripe
age
proved
intelligence
great
rectitude
and
perfect
discretion
and
it
is
one
of
the
miracles
wrought
by
heaven
in
favor
of
paris
that
some
men
of
that
stamp
are
always
forthcoming
any
description
of
the
palais
de
justice
would
be
incomplete
without
due
mention
of
these
officials
as
they
may
be
called
the
most
powerful
adjuncts
of
the
law
for
though
it
must
be
owned
that
the
force
of
circumstances
has
abrogated
the
ancient
pomp
and
wealth
of
justice
it
has
materially
gained
in
many
ways
in
paris
especially
its
machinery
is
admirably
perfect
monsieur
de
granville
had
sent
his
secretary
monsieur
de
chargeboeuf
to
attend
lucien
s
funeral
he
needed
a
substitute
for
this
business
a
man
he
could
trust
and
monsieur
garnery
was
one
of
the
commissioners
in
the
delegates
office
monsieur
said
jacques
collin
i
have
already
proved
to
you
that
i
have
a
sense
of
honor
you
let
me
go
free
and
i
came
by
this
time
the
funeral
mass
for
lucien
is
ended
they
will
be
carrying
him
to
the
grave
instead
of
remanding
me
to
the
conciergerie
give
me
leave
to
follow
the
boy
s
body
to
i
will
come
back
and
surrender
myself
go
said
monsieur
de
granville
in
the
kindest
tone
one
word
more
monsieur
the
money
belonging
to
that
girl
lucien
s
mistress
was
not
stolen
during
the
short
time
of
liberty
you
allowed
me
i
questioned
her
servants
i
am
sure
of
them
as
you
are
of
your
two
commissioners
of
the
delegates
office
the
money
paid
for
the
certificate
sold
by
mademoiselle
esther
gobseck
will
certainly
be
found
in
her
room
when
the
seals
are
removed
her
maid
remarked
to
me
that
the
deceased
was
given
to
and
very
distrustful
she
no
doubt
hid
the
banknotes
in
her
bed
let
the
bedstead
be
carefully
examined
and
taken
to
pieces
the
mattresses
unsewn
the
money
will
be
you
are
sure
of
that
i
am
sure
of
the
relative
honesty
of
my
rascals
they
never
play
any
tricks
on
me
i
hold
the
power
of
life
and
death
i
try
and
condemn
them
and
carry
out
my
sentence
without
all
your
formalities
you
can
see
for
yourself
the
results
of
my
authority
i
will
recover
the
money
stolen
from
monsieur
and
madame
crottat
i
will
hand
you
over
one
of
s
men
his
right
hand
caught
in
the
act
and
i
will
tell
you
the
secret
of
the
nanterre
murders
this
is
not
a
bad
beginning
and
if
you
only
employ
me
in
the
service
of
the
law
and
the
police
by
the
end
of
a
year
you
will
be
satisfied
with
all
i
can
tell
you
i
will
be
thoroughly
all
that
i
ought
to
be
and
shall
manage
to
succeed
in
all
the
business
that
is
placed
in
my
i
can
promise
you
nothing
but
my
goodwill
what
you
ask
is
not
in
my
power
the
privilege
of
granting
pardons
is
the
king
s
alone
on
the
recommendation
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
and
the
place
you
wish
to
hold
is
in
the
gift
of
the
prefet
of
monsieur
garnery
the
announced
at
a
nod
from
monsieur
de
granville
the
delegate
commissioner
came
in
glanced
at
jacques
collin
as
one
who
knows
and
gulped
down
his
astonishment
on
hearing
the
word
go
spoken
to
jacques
collin
by
monsieur
de
granville
allow
me
said
jacques
collin
to
remain
here
till
monsieur
garnery
has
returned
with
the
documents
in
which
all
my
strength
lies
that
i
may
take
away
with
me
some
expression
of
your
this
absolute
humility
and
sincerity
touched
the
public
prosecutor
go
said
he
i
can
depend
on
jacques
collin
bowed
humbly
with
the
submissiveness
of
an
inferior
to
his
master
ten
minutes
later
monsieur
de
granville
was
in
possession
of
the
letters
in
three
sealed
packets
that
had
not
been
opened
but
the
importance
of
this
point
and
jacques
collin
s
avowal
had
made
him
forget
the
convict
s
promise
to
cure
madame
de
serizy
when
once
he
was
outside
jacques
collin
had
an
indescribable
sense
of
satisfaction
he
felt
he
was
free
and
born
to
a
new
phase
of
life
he
walked
quickly
from
the
palais
to
the
church
of
where
mass
was
over
the
coffin
was
being
sprinkled
with
holy
water
and
he
arrived
in
time
thus
to
bid
farewell
in
a
christian
fashion
to
the
mortal
remains
of
the
youth
he
had
loved
so
well
then
he
got
into
a
carriage
and
drove
after
the
body
to
the
cemetery
in
paris
unless
on
very
exceptional
occasions
or
when
some
famous
man
has
died
a
natural
death
the
crowd
that
gathers
about
a
funeral
diminishes
by
degrees
as
the
procession
approaches
people
make
time
to
show
themselves
in
church
but
every
one
has
his
business
to
attend
to
and
returns
to
it
as
soon
as
possible
thus
of
ten
mourning
carriages
only
four
were
occupied
by
the
time
they
reached
there
were
not
more
than
a
dozen
followers
among
whom
was
rastignac
that
is
right
it
is
well
that
you
are
faithful
to
him
said
jacques
collin
to
his
old
acquaintance
rastignac
started
with
surprise
at
seeing
vautrin
be
calm
said
his
old
at
madame
vauquer
s
i
am
your
slave
if
only
because
i
find
you
here
my
help
is
not
to
be
despised
i
am
or
shall
be
more
powerful
than
ever
you
slipped
your
cable
and
you
did
it
very
cleverly
but
you
may
need
me
yet
and
i
will
always
be
at
your
service
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
supply
the
hulks
with
lodgers
instead
of
lodging
there
replied
jacques
collin
rastignac
gave
a
shrug
of
disgust
but
if
you
were
robbed
rastignac
hurried
on
to
get
away
from
jacques
collin
you
do
not
know
what
circumstances
you
may
find
yourself
they
stood
by
the
grave
dug
by
the
side
of
esther
s
two
beings
who
loved
each
other
and
who
were
happy
said
jacques
collin
they
are
it
is
some
comfort
to
rot
together
i
will
be
buried
when
lucien
s
body
was
lowered
into
the
grave
jacques
collin
fell
in
a
dead
faint
this
strong
man
could
not
endure
the
light
rattle
of
the
spadefuls
of
earth
thrown
by
the
gravediggers
on
the
coffin
as
a
hint
for
their
payment
just
then
two
men
of
the
corps
of
public
safety
came
up
they
recognized
jacques
collin
lifted
him
up
and
carried
him
to
a
hackney
coach
what
is
up
now
asked
jacques
collin
when
he
recovered
consciousness
and
had
looked
about
him
he
saw
himself
between
two
constables
one
of
whom
was
ruffard
and
he
gave
him
a
look
which
pierced
the
murderer
s
soul
to
the
very
depths
of
la
gonore
s
secret
why
the
public
prosecutor
wants
you
replied
ruffard
and
we
have
been
hunting
for
you
everywhere
and
found
you
in
the
cemetery
where
you
had
nearly
taken
a
header
into
that
boy
s
jacques
collin
was
silent
for
a
moment
is
it
that
is
after
me
he
asked
the
other
man
no
monsieur
garnery
sent
us
to
find
and
he
told
you
nothing
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
holding
council
in
expressive
pantomime
come
what
did
he
say
when
he
gave
you
your
orders
he
bid
us
fetch
you
at
once
said
ruffard
and
said
we
should
find
you
at
the
church
of
or
if
the
funeral
had
left
the
church
at
the
the
public
prosecutor
wants
me
that
is
it
said
jacques
collin
he
wants
my
and
he
relapsed
into
silence
which
greatly
puzzled
the
two
constables
at
about
two
jacques
collin
once
more
went
up
to
monsieur
de
granville
s
room
and
found
there
a
fresh
arrival
in
the
person
of
monsieur
de
granville
s
predecessor
the
comte
octave
de
bauvan
one
of
the
presidents
of
the
court
of
appeals
you
forgot
madame
de
serizy
s
dangerous
condition
and
that
you
had
promised
to
save
ask
these
rascals
in
what
state
they
found
me
monsieur
said
jacques
collin
signing
to
the
two
constables
to
come
in
unconscious
monsieur
lying
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
of
the
young
man
they
were
save
madame
de
serizy
said
the
comte
de
bauvan
and
you
shall
have
what
you
i
ask
for
nothing
said
jacques
collin
i
surrendered
at
discretion
and
monsieur
de
granville
must
have
received
all
the
letters
yes
said
the
magistrate
but
you
promised
to
save
madame
de
serizy
s
reason
can
you
was
it
not
a
vain
boast
i
hope
i
can
replied
jacques
collin
modestly
well
then
come
with
me
said
comte
octave
no
monsieur
i
will
not
be
seen
in
the
same
carriage
by
your
side
i
am
still
a
convict
it
is
my
wish
to
serve
the
law
i
will
not
begin
by
discrediting

jacqueline

have
not
been
wasting
my
time
here
among
the
let
ginetta
the
corsican
girl

on
smiling
at
his
aunt

said
jacques
then
we
meet
this
evening
replied
the
aunt
you
are
in
such
a
deuce
of
a
hurry
is
there
a
fat
job
on
i
want
to
begin
with
a
stroke
that
will
beat
everything
that
has
ever
done
i
have
spoken
a
few
words
to
the
brute
who
killed
lucien
and
i
live
only
for
revenge
thanks
to
our
positions
he
and
i
shall
be
equally
strong
equally
protected
it
will
take
years
to
strike
the
blow
but
the
wretch
shall
have
it
straight
in
the
he
must
have
vowed
a
roland
for
your
oliver
said
the
aunt
for
he
has
taken
charge
of
peyrade
s
daughter
the
girl
who
was
sold
to
madame
nourrisson
you
our
first
point
must
be
to
find
him
a
that
will
be
difficult
he
must
be
tolerably
observed
jacqueline
well
hatred
keeps
one
alive
we
must
work
jacques
collin
took
a
cab
and
drove
at
once
to
the
quai
malaquais
to
the
little
room
he
lodged
in
quite
separate
from
lucien
s
apartment
the
porter
greatly
astonished
at
seeing
him
wanted
to
tell
him
all
that
had
happened
i
know
everything
said
the
abbe
i
have
been
involved
in
it
in
spite
of
my
saintly
reputation
but
thanks
to
the
intervention
of
the
spanish
ambassador
i
have
been
he
hurried
up
to
his
room
where
from
under
the
cover
of
a
breviary
he
took
out
a
letter
that
lucien
had
written
to
madame
de
serizy
after
that
lady
had
discarded
him
on
seeing
him
at
the
opera
with
esther
lucien
in
his
despair
had
decided
on
not
sending
this
letter
believing
himself
cast
off
for
ever
but
jacques
collin
had
read
the
little
masterpiece
and
as
all
that
lucien
wrote
was
to
him
sacred
he
had
treasured
the
letter
in
his
for
its
poetical
expression
of
a
passion
that
was
chiefly
vanity
when
monsieur
de
granville
told
him
of
madame
de
serizy
s
condition
the
man
had
very
wisely
concluded
that
this
fine
lady
s
despair
and
frenzy
must
be
the
result
of
the
quarrel
she
had
allowed
to
subsist
between
herself
and
lucien
he
knew
women
as
magistrates
know
criminals
he
guessed
the
most
secret
impulses
of
their
hearts
and
he
at
once
understood
that
the
countess
probably
ascribed
lucien
s
death
partly
to
her
own
severity
and
reproached
herself
bitterly
obviously
a
man
on
whom
she
had
shed
her
love
would
never
have
thrown
away
his
life
to
know
that
he
had
loved
her
still
in
spite
of
her
cruelty
might
restore
her
reason
if
jacques
collin
was
a
grand
general
of
convicts
he
was
it
must
be
owned
a
not
less
skilful
physician
of
souls
this
man
s
arrival
at
the
mansion
of
the
serizys
was
at
once
a
disgrace
and
a
promise
several
persons
the
count
and
the
doctors
were
assembled
in
the
little
adjoining
the
countess
bedroom
but
to
spare
him
this
stain
on
his
soul
s
honor
the
comte
de
bauvan
dismissed
everybody
and
remained
alone
with
his
friend
it
was
bad
enough
even
then
for
the
of
the
privy
council
to
see
this
gloomy
and
sinister
visitor
come
in
jacques
collin
had
changed
his
dress
he
was
in
black
with
trousers
and
a
plain
and
his
gait
his
look
and
his
manner
were
all
that
could
be
wished
he
bowed
to
the
two
statesmen
and
asked
if
he
might
be
admitted
to
see
the
countess
she
awaits
you
with
impatience
said
monsieur
de
bauvan
with
impatience
then
she
is
saved
said
the
dreadful
magician
and
in
fact
after
an
interview
of
half
an
hour
jacques
collin
opened
the
door
and
said
come
in
monsieur
le
comte
there
is
nothing
further
to
the
countess
had
the
letter
clasped
to
her
heart
she
was
calm
and
seemed
to
have
forgiven
herself
the
count
gave
expression
to
his
joy
at
the
sight
and
these
are
the
men
who
settle
our
fate
and
the
fate
of
nations
thought
jacques
collin
shrugging
his
shoulders
behind
the
two
men
a
female
has
but
to
sigh
in
the
wrong
way
to
turn
their
brain
as
if
it
were
a
glove
a
wink
and
they
lose
their
head
a
petticoat
raised
a
little
higher
dropped
a
little
lower
and
they
rush
round
paris
in
despair
the
whims
of
a
woman
react
on
the
whole
country
ah
how
much
stronger
is
a
man
when
like
me
he
keeps
far
away
from
this
childish
tyranny
from
honor
ruined
by
passion
from
this
frank
malignity
and
wiles
worthy
of
savages
woman
with
her
genius
for
ruthlessness
her
talent
for
torture
is
and
always
will
be
the
marring
of
man
the
public
prosecutor
the
minister
here
they
are
all
hoodwinked
all
moving
the
spheres
for
some
letters
written
by
a
duchess
and
a
chit
or
to
save
the
reason
of
a
woman
who
is
more
crazy
in
her
right
mind
than
she
was
in
her
and
he
smiled
haughtily
ay
said
he
to
himself
and
they
believe
in
me
they
act
on
my
information
and
will
leave
me
in
power
i
shall
still
rule
the
world
which
has
obeyed
me
these
jacques
collin
had
brought
into
play
the
overpowering
influence
he
had
exerted
of
yore
over
poor
esther
for
he
had
as
has
often
been
shown
the
mode
of
speech
the
look
the
action
which
quell
madmen
and
he
had
depicted
lucien
as
having
died
with
the
countess
image
in
his
heart
no
woman
can
resist
the
idea
of
having
been
the
one
beloved
you
now
have
no
rival
had
been
this
bitter
jester
s
last
words
he
remained
a
whole
hour
alone
and
forgotten
in
that
little
room
monsieur
de
granville
arrived
and
found
him
gloomy
standing
up
and
lost
in
a
brown
study
as
a
man
may
well
be
who
makes
an
brumaire
in
his
life
the
public
prosecutor
went
to
the
door
of
the
countess
room
and
remained
there
a
few
minutes
then
he
turned
to
jacques
collin
and
said
you
have
not
changed
your
mind
no
well
then
you
will
take
s
place
and
calvi
s
sentence
will
be
and
he
is
not
to
be
sent
to
rochefort
not
even
to
toulon
you
may
employ
him
in
your
service
but
these
reprieves
and
your
appointment
depend
on
your
conduct
for
the
next
six
months
as
subordinate
