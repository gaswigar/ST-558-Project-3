the
black
robe
by
wilkie
collins
before
the
story
first
the
duel
i
the
doctors
could
do
no
more
for
the
dowager
lady
berrick
when
the
medical
advisers
of
a
lady
who
has
reached
seventy
years
of
age
recommend
the
mild
climate
of
the
south
of
france
they
mean
in
plain
language
that
they
have
arrived
at
the
end
of
their
resources
her
ladyship
gave
the
mild
climate
a
fair
trial
and
then
decided
as
she
herself
expressed
it
to
die
at
traveling
slowly
she
had
reached
paris
at
the
date
when
i
last
heard
of
her
it
was
then
the
beginning
of
november
a
week
later
i
met
with
her
nephew
lewis
romayne
at
the
club
what
brings
you
to
london
at
this
time
of
year
i
asked
the
fatality
that
pursues
me
he
answered
grimly
i
am
one
of
the
unluckiest
men
he
was
thirty
years
old
he
was
not
married
he
was
the
enviable
possessor
of
the
fine
old
country
seat
called
vange
abbey
he
had
no
poor
relations
and
he
was
one
of
the
handsomest
men
in
england
when
i
add
that
i
am
myself
a
retired
army
officer
with
a
wretched
income
a
disagreeable
wife
four
ugly
children
and
a
burden
of
fifty
years
on
my
back
no
one
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
i
answered
romayne
with
bitter
sincerity
in
these
words
i
wish
to
heaven
i
could
change
places
with
you
i
wish
to
heaven
you
could
he
burst
out
with
equal
sincerity
on
his
side
read
he
handed
me
a
letter
addressed
to
him
by
the
traveling
medical
attendant
of
lady
berrick
after
resting
in
paris
the
patient
had
continued
her
homeward
journey
as
far
as
boulogne
in
her
suffering
condition
she
was
liable
to
sudden
fits
of
caprice
an
insurmountable
horror
of
the
channel
passage
had
got
possession
of
her
she
positively
refused
to
be
taken
on
board
the
steamboat
in
this
difficulty
the
lady
who
held
the
post
of
her
companion
had
ventured
on
a
suggestion
would
lady
berrick
consent
to
make
the
channel
passage
if
her
nephew
came
to
boulogne
expressly
to
accompany
her
on
the
voyage
the
reply
had
been
so
immediately
favorable
that
the
doctor
lost
no
time
in
communicating
with
lewis
romayne
this
was
the
substance
of
the
letter
it
was
needless
to
ask
any
more
questions
romayne
was
plainly
on
his
way
to
boulogne
i
gave
him
some
useful
information
try
the
oysters
i
said
at
the
restaurant
on
the
he
never
even
thanked
me
he
was
thinking
entirely
of
himself
just
look
at
my
position
he
said
i
detest
boulogne
i
cordially
share
my
aunt
s
horror
of
the
channel
passage
i
had
looked
forward
to
some
months
of
happy
retirement
in
the
country
among
my
books
and
what
happens
to
me
i
am
brought
to
london
in
this
season
of
fogs
to
travel
by
the
tidal
train
at
seven
morning
and
all
for
a
woman
with
whom
i
have
no
sympathies
in
common
if
i
am
not
an
unlucky
man
who
is
he
spoke
in
a
tone
of
vehement
irritation
which
seemed
to
me
under
the
circumstances
to
be
simply
absurd
but
nervous
system
is
not
the
irritable
system
sorely
tried
by
night
study
and
strong
tea
of
my
friend
romayne
it
s
only
a
matter
of
two
days
i
remarked
by
way
of
reconciling
him
to
his
situation
how
do
i
know
that
he
retorted
in
two
days
the
weather
may
be
stormy
in
two
days
she
may
be
too
ill
to
be
moved
unfortunately
i
am
her
heir
and
i
am
told
i
must
submit
to
any
whim
that
seizes
her
i
m
rich
enough
already
i
don
t
want
her
money
besides
i
dislike
all
traveling
and
especially
traveling
alone
you
are
an
idle
man
if
you
were
a
good
friend
you
would
offer
to
go
with
he
added
with
the
delicacy
which
was
one
of
the
redeeming
points
in
his
wayward
character
of
course
as
my
i
had
known
him
long
enough
not
to
take
offense
at
his
reminding
me
in
this
considerate
way
that
i
was
a
poor
man
the
proposed
change
of
scene
tempted
me
what
did
i
care
for
the
channel
passage
besides
there
was
the
irresistible
attraction
of
getting
away
from
home
the
end
of
it
was
that
i
accepted
romayne
s
invitation
ii
shortly
after
noon
on
the
next
day
we
were
established
at
boulogne
near
lady
berrick
but
not
at
her
hotel
if
we
live
in
the
same
house
romayne
reminded
me
we
shall
be
bored
by
the
companion
and
the
doctor
meetings
on
the
stairs
you
know
and
exchanging
bows
and
small
he
hated
those
trivial
conventionalities
of
society
in
which
other
people
delight
when
somebody
once
asked
him
in
what
company
he
felt
most
at
ease
he
made
a
shocking
answer
he
said
in
the
company
of
i
waited
for
him
on
the
pier
while
he
went
to
see
her
ladyship
he
joined
me
again
with
his
bitterest
smile
what
did
i
tell
you
she
is
not
well
enough
to
see
me
the
doctor
looks
grave
and
the
companion
puts
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
we
may
be
kept
in
this
place
for
weeks
to
the
afternoon
proved
to
be
rainy
our
early
dinner
was
a
bad
one
this
last
circumstance
tried
his
temper
sorely
he
was
no
gourmand
the
question
of
cookery
was
with
him
purely
a
matter
of
digestion
those
late
hours
of
study
and
that
abuse
of
tea
to
which
i
have
already
alluded
had
sadly
injured
his
stomach
the
doctors
warned
him
of
serious
consequences
to
his
nervous
system
unless
he
altered
his
habits
he
had
little
faith
in
medical
science
and
he
greatly
overrated
the
restorative
capacity
of
his
constitution
so
far
as
i
know
he
had
always
neglected
the
doctors
advice
the
weather
cleared
toward
evening
and
we
went
out
for
a
walk
we
passed
a
church
a
roman
catholic
church
of
course
the
doors
of
which
were
still
open
some
poor
women
were
kneeling
at
their
prayers
in
the
dim
light
wait
a
minute
said
romayne
i
am
in
a
vile
temper
let
me
try
to
put
myself
into
a
better
frame
of
i
followed
him
into
the
church
he
knelt
down
in
a
dark
corner
by
himself
i
confess
i
was
surprised
he
had
been
baptized
in
the
church
of
england
but
so
far
as
outward
practice
was
concerned
he
belonged
to
no
religious
community
i
had
often
heard
him
speak
with
sincere
reverence
and
admiration
of
the
spirit
of
christianity
but
he
never
to
my
knowledge
attended
any
place
of
public
worship
when
we
met
again
outside
the
church
i
asked
if
he
had
been
converted
to
the
roman
catholic
faith
no
he
said
i
hate
the
inveterate
striving
of
that
priesthood
after
social
influence
and
political
power
as
cordially
as
the
fiercest
protestant
living
but
let
us
not
forget
that
the
church
of
rome
has
great
merits
to
set
against
great
faults
its
system
is
administered
with
an
admirable
knowledge
of
the
higher
needs
of
human
nature
take
as
one
example
what
you
have
just
seen
the
solemn
tranquillity
of
that
church
the
poor
people
praying
near
me
the
few
words
of
prayer
by
which
i
silently
united
myself
to
my
have
calmed
me
and
done
me
good
in
country
i
should
have
found
the
church
closed
out
of
service
he
took
my
arm
and
abruptly
changed
the
subject
how
will
you
occupy
yourself
he
asked
if
my
aunt
receives
me
i
assured
him
that
i
should
easily
find
ways
and
means
of
getting
through
the
time
the
next
morning
a
message
came
from
lady
berrick
to
say
that
she
would
see
her
nephew
after
breakfast
left
by
myself
i
walked
toward
the
pier
and
met
with
a
man
who
asked
me
to
hire
his
boat
he
had
lines
and
bait
at
my
service
most
unfortunately
as
the
event
proved
i
decided
on
occupying
an
hour
or
two
by
sea
fishing
the
wind
shifted
while
we
were
out
and
before
we
could
get
back
to
the
harbor
the
tide
had
turned
against
us
it
was
six
o
clock
when
i
arrived
at
the
hotel
a
little
open
carriage
was
waiting
at
the
door
i
found
romayne
impatiently
expecting
me
and
no
signs
of
dinner
on
the
table
he
informed
me
that
he
had
accepted
an
invitation
in
which
i
was
included
and
promised
to
explain
everything
in
the
carriage
our
driver
took
the
road
that
led
toward
the
high
town
i
subordinated
my
curiosity
to
my
sense
of
politeness
and
asked
for
news
of
his
aunt
s
health
she
is
seriously
ill
poor
soul
he
said
i
am
sorry
i
spoke
so
petulantly
and
so
unfairly
when
we
met
at
the
club
the
near
prospect
of
death
has
developed
qualities
in
her
nature
which
i
ought
to
have
seen
before
this
no
matter
how
it
may
be
delayed
i
will
patiently
wait
her
time
for
the
crossing
to
so
long
as
he
believed
himself
to
be
in
the
right
he
was
as
to
his
actions
and
opinions
one
of
the
most
obstinate
men
i
ever
met
with
but
once
let
him
be
convinced
that
he
was
wrong
and
he
rushed
into
the
other
extreme
became
needlessly
distrustful
of
himself
and
needlessly
eager
in
seizing
his
opportunity
of
making
atonement
in
this
latter
mood
he
was
capable
with
the
best
intentions
of
committing
acts
of
the
most
childish
imprudence
with
some
misgivings
i
asked
how
he
had
amused
himself
in
my
absence
i
waited
for
you
he
said
till
i
lost
all
patience
and
went
out
for
a
walk
first
i
thought
of
going
to
the
beach
but
the
smell
of
the
harbor
drove
me
back
into
the
town
and
there
oddly
enough
i
met
with
a
man
a
certain
captain
peterkin
who
had
been
a
friend
of
mine
at
a
visitor
to
boulogne
i
inquired
not
a
resident
yes
the
fact
is
i
lost
sight
of
peterkin
when
i
left
oxford
and
since
that
time
he
seems
to
have
drifted
into
difficulties
we
had
a
long
talk
he
is
living
here
he
tells
me
until
his
affairs
are
i
needed
no
further
enlightenment
captain
peterkin
stood
as
plainly
revealed
to
me
as
if
i
had
known
him
for
years
isn
t
it
a
little
imprudent
i
said
to
renew
your
acquaintance
with
a
man
of
that
sort
couldn
t
you
have
passed
him
with
a
bow
romayne
smiled
uneasily
i
daresay
you
re
right
he
answered
but
remember
i
had
left
my
aunt
feeling
ashamed
of
the
unjust
way
in
which
i
had
thought
and
spoken
of
her
how
did
i
know
that
i
mightn
t
be
wronging
an
old
friend
next
if
i
kept
peterkin
at
a
distance
his
present
position
may
be
as
much
his
misfortune
poor
fellow
as
his
fault
i
was
half
inclined
to
pass
him
as
you
say
but
i
distrusted
my
own
judgment
he
held
out
his
hand
and
he
was
so
glad
to
see
me
it
can
t
be
helped
now
i
shall
be
anxious
to
hear
your
opinion
of
are
we
going
to
dine
with
captain
peterkin
yes
i
happened
to
mention
that
wretched
dinner
yesterday
at
our
hotel
he
said
come
to
my
out
of
paris
there
isn
t
such
a
table
d
hote
in
i
tried
to
get
off
it
not
caring
as
you
know
to
go
among
strangers
i
said
i
had
a
friend
with
me
he
invited
you
most
cordially
to
accompany
me
more
excuses
on
my
part
only
led
to
a
painful
result
i
hurt
peterkin
s
feelings
i
m
down
in
the
world
he
said
and
i
m
not
fit
company
for
you
and
your
friends
i
beg
your
pardon
for
taking
the
liberty
of
inviting
you
he
turned
away
with
the
tears
in
his
eyes
what
could
i
do
i
thought
to
myself
you
could
have
lent
him
five
pounds
and
got
rid
of
his
invitation
without
the
slightest
if
i
had
returned
in
reasonable
time
to
go
out
with
romayne
we
might
not
have
met
the
captain
or
if
we
had
met
him
my
presence
would
have
prevented
the
confidential
talk
and
the
invitation
that
followed
i
felt
i
was
to
blame
and
yet
how
could
i
help
it
it
was
useless
to
remonstrate
the
mischief
was
done
we
left
the
old
town
on
our
right
hand
and
drove
on
past
a
little
colony
of
suburban
villas
to
a
house
standing
by
itself
surrounded
by
a
stone
wall
as
we
crossed
the
front
garden
on
our
way
to
the
door
i
noticed
against
the
side
of
the
house
two
kennels
inhabited
by
two
large
was
the
proprietor
afraid
of
thieves
iii
the
moment
we
were
introduced
to
the
my
suspicions
of
the
company
we
were
likely
to
meet
with
were
fully
confirmed
cards
billiards
and
betting
there
was
the
inscription
legibly
written
on
the
manner
and
appearance
of
captain
peterkin
the
yellow
old
lady
who
kept
the
would
have
been
worth
five
thousand
pounds
in
jewelry
alone
if
the
ornaments
which
profusely
covered
her
had
been
genuine
precious
stones
the
younger
ladies
present
had
their
cheeks
as
highly
rouged
and
their
eyelids
as
elaborately
penciled
in
black
as
if
they
were
going
on
the
stage
instead
of
going
to
dinner
we
found
these
fair
creatures
drinking
madeira
as
a
whet
to
their
appetites
among
the
men
there
were
two
who
struck
me
as
the
most
finished
and
complete
blackguards
whom
i
had
ever
met
with
in
all
my
experience
at
home
and
abroad
one
with
a
brown
face
and
a
broken
nose
was
presented
to
us
by
the
title
of
commander
and
was
described
as
a
person
of
great
wealth
and
distinction
in
peru
traveling
for
amusement
the
other
wore
a
military
uniform
and
decorations
and
was
spoken
of
as
the
a
bold
bullying
manner
a
fat
sodden
face
little
leering
eyes
and
hands
made
this
man
so
repellent
to
me
that
i
privately
longed
to
kick
him
romayne
had
evidently
been
announced
before
our
arrival
as
a
landed
gentleman
with
a
large
income
men
and
women
vied
in
servile
attentions
to
him
when
we
went
into
the
the
fascinating
creature
who
sat
next
to
him
held
her
fan
before
her
face
and
so
made
a
private
interview
of
it
between
the
rich
englishman
and
herself
with
regard
to
the
dinner
i
shall
only
report
that
it
justified
captain
peterkin
s
boast
in
some
degree
at
least
the
wine
was
good
and
the
conversation
became
gay
to
the
verge
of
indelicacy
usually
the
most
temperate
of
men
romayne
was
tempted
by
his
neighbors
into
drinking
freely
i
was
unfortunately
seated
at
the
opposite
extremity
of
the
table
and
i
had
no
opportunity
of
warning
him
the
dinner
reached
its
conclusion
and
we
all
returned
together
on
the
foreign
plan
to
coffee
and
cigars
in
the
the
women
smoked
and
drank
liqueurs
as
well
as
coffee
with
the
men
one
of
them
went
to
the
piano
and
a
little
impromptu
ball
followed
the
ladies
dancing
with
their
cigarettes
in
their
mouths
keeping
my
eyes
and
ears
on
the
alert
i
saw
an
table
with
a
surface
of
rosewood
suddenly
develop
a
substance
of
green
cloth
at
the
same
time
a
neat
little
made
its
appearance
from
a
in
a
sofa
passing
near
the
venerable
landlady
i
heard
her
ask
the
servant
in
a
whisper
if
the
dogs
were
loose
after
what
i
had
observed
i
could
only
conclude
that
the
dogs
were
used
as
a
patrol
to
give
the
alarm
in
case
of
a
descent
of
the
police
it
was
plainly
high
time
to
thank
captain
peterkin
for
his
hospitality
and
to
take
our
leave
we
have
had
enough
of
this
i
whispered
to
romayne
in
english
let
us
in
these
days
it
is
a
delusion
to
suppose
that
you
can
speak
confidentially
in
the
english
language
when
french
people
are
within
hearing
one
of
the
ladies
asked
romayne
tenderly
if
he
was
tired
of
her
already
another
reminded
him
that
it
was
raining
heavily
as
we
could
all
hear
and
suggested
waiting
until
it
cleared
up
the
hideous
general
waved
his
greasy
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
card
table
and
said
the
game
is
waiting
for
romayne
was
excited
but
not
stupefied
by
the
wine
he
had
drunk
he
answered
discreetly
enough
i
must
beg
you
to
excuse
me
i
am
a
poor
card
the
general
suddenly
looked
grave
you
are
speaking
sir
under
a
strange
misapprehension
he
said
our
game
is
lansquenet
essentially
a
game
of
chance
with
luck
the
poorest
player
is
a
match
for
the
whole
romayne
persisted
in
his
refusal
as
a
matter
of
course
i
supported
him
with
all
needful
care
to
avoid
giving
offense
the
general
took
offense
nevertheless
he
crossed
his
arms
on
his
breast
and
looked
at
us
fiercely
does
this
mean
gentlemen
that
you
distrust
the
company
he
asked
the
commander
hearing
the
question
immediately
joined
us
in
the
interests
of
peace
bearing
with
him
the
elements
of
persuasion
under
the
form
of
a
lady
on
his
arm
the
lady
stepped
briskly
forward
and
tapped
the
general
on
the
shoulder
with
her
fan
i
am
one
of
the
company
she
said
and
i
am
sure
romayne
doesn
t
distrust
she
turned
to
romayne
with
her
most
irresistible
smile
a
gentleman
always
plays
cards
she
resumed
when
he
has
a
lady
for
a
partner
let
us
join
our
interests
at
the
table
and
dear
romayne
don
t
risk
too
much
she
put
her
pretty
little
purse
into
his
hand
and
looked
as
if
she
had
been
in
love
with
him
for
half
her
lifetime
the
fatal
influence
of
the
sex
assisted
by
wine
produced
the
inevitable
result
romayne
allowed
himself
to
be
led
to
the
card
table
for
a
moment
the
general
delayed
the
beginning
of
the
game
after
what
had
happened
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
assert
the
strict
sense
of
justice
that
was
in
him
we
are
all
honorable
men
he
began
and
brave
men
the
commander
added
admiring
the
general
and
brave
men
the
general
admitted
admiring
the
commander
gentlemen
if
i
have
been
led
into
expressing
myself
with
unnecessary
warmth
of
feeling
i
apologize
and
regret
it
nobly
spoken
the
commander
pronounced
the
general
put
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
bowed
the
game
began
as
the
poorest
man
of
the
two
i
had
escaped
the
attentions
lavished
by
the
ladies
on
romayne
at
the
same
time
i
was
obliged
to
pay
for
my
dinner
by
taking
some
part
in
the
proceedings
of
the
evening
small
stakes
were
allowed
i
found
at
roulette
and
besides
the
heavy
chances
in
favor
of
the
table
made
it
hardly
worth
while
to
run
the
risk
of
cheating
in
this
case
i
placed
myself
next
to
the
least
man
in
the
company
and
played
roulette
for
a
wonder
i
was
successful
at
the
first
attempt
my
neighbor
handed
me
my
winnings
i
have
lost
every
farthing
i
possess
he
whispered
to
me
piteously
and
i
have
a
wife
and
children
at
i
lent
the
poor
wretch
five
francs
he
smiled
faintly
as
he
looked
at
the
money
it
reminds
me
he
said
of
my
last
transaction
when
i
borrowed
of
that
gentleman
there
who
is
betting
on
the
general
s
luck
at
the
card
table
beware
of
employing
him
as
i
did
what
do
you
think
i
got
for
my
note
of
hand
of
four
thousand
francs
a
hundred
bottles
of
champagne
fifty
bottles
of
ink
fifty
bottles
of
blacking
three
dozen
handkerchiefs
two
pictures
by
unknown
masters
two
shawls
one
hundred
maps
five
we
went
on
playing
my
luck
deserted
me
i
lost
and
lost
and
lost
again
from
time
to
time
i
looked
round
at
the
card
table
the
deal
had
fallen
early
to
the
general
and
it
seemed
to
be
indefinitely
prolonged
a
heap
of
notes
and
gold
won
mainly
from
romayne
as
i
afterward
discovered
lay
before
him
as
for
my
neighbor
the
unhappy
possessor
of
the
bottles
of
blacking
the
pictures
by
unknown
masters
and
the
rest
of
it
he
won
and
then
rashly
presumed
on
his
good
fortune
deprived
of
his
last
farthing
he
retired
into
a
corner
of
the
room
and
consoled
himself
with
a
cigar
i
had
just
arisen
to
follow
his
example
when
a
furious
uproar
burst
out
at
the
card
table
i
saw
romayne
spring
up
and
snatch
the
cards
out
of
the
general
s
hand
you
scoundrel
he
shouted
you
are
cheating
the
general
started
to
his
feet
in
a
fury
you
lie
he
cried
i
attempted
to
interfere
but
romayne
had
already
seen
the
necessity
of
controlling
himself
a
gentleman
doesn
t
accept
an
insult
from
a
swindler
he
said
coolly
accept
this
then
the
general
answered
and
spat
on
him
in
an
instant
romayne
knocked
him
down
the
blow
was
dealt
straight
between
his
eyes
he
was
a
gross
man
and
he
fell
heavily
for
the
time
he
was
stunned
the
women
ran
screaming
out
of
the
room
the
peaceable
commander
trembled
from
head
to
foot
two
of
the
men
present
who
to
give
them
their
due
were
no
cowards
locked
the
doors
you
don
t
go
they
said
till
we
see
whether
he
recovers
or
cold
water
assisted
by
the
landlady
s
smelling
salts
brought
the
general
to
his
senses
after
a
while
he
whispered
something
to
one
of
his
friends
who
immediately
turned
to
me
the
general
challenges
romayne
he
said
as
one
of
his
seconds
i
demand
an
appointment
for
i
refused
to
make
any
appointment
unless
the
doors
were
first
unlocked
and
we
were
left
free
to
depart
our
carriage
is
waiting
outside
i
added
if
it
returns
to
the
hotel
without
us
there
will
be
an
this
latter
consideration
had
its
effect
on
their
side
the
doors
were
opened
on
our
side
the
appointment
was
made
we
left
the
house
iv
in
consenting
to
receive
the
general
s
representative
it
is
needless
to
say
that
i
merely
desired
to
avoid
provoking
another
quarrel
if
those
persons
were
really
impudent
enough
to
call
at
the
hotel
i
had
arranged
to
threaten
them
with
the
interference
of
the
police
and
so
to
put
an
end
to
the
matter
romayne
expressed
no
opinion
on
the
subject
one
way
or
the
other
his
conduct
inspired
me
with
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
the
filthy
insult
of
which
he
had
been
made
the
object
seemed
to
be
rankling
in
his
mind
he
went
away
thoughtfully
to
his
own
room
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
i
asked
he
only
answered
wait
till
the
next
day
the
seconds
appeared
i
had
expected
to
see
two
of
the
men
with
whom
we
had
dined
to
my
astonishment
the
visitors
proved
to
be
officers
of
the
general
s
regiment
they
brought
proposals
for
a
hostile
meeting
the
next
morning
the
choice
of
weapons
being
left
to
romayne
as
the
challenged
man
it
was
now
quite
plain
to
me
that
the
general
s
peculiar
method
of
had
thus
far
not
been
discovered
and
exposed
he
might
keep
doubtful
company
and
might
as
i
afterward
heard
be
suspected
in
certain
quarters
but
that
he
still
had
a
reputation
to
preserve
was
proved
by
the
appearance
of
the
two
gentlemen
present
as
his
representatives
they
declared
with
evident
sincerity
that
romayne
had
made
a
fatal
mistake
had
provoked
the
insult
offered
to
him
and
had
resented
it
by
a
brutal
and
cowardly
outrage
as
a
man
and
a
soldier
the
general
was
doubly
bound
to
insist
on
a
duel
no
apology
would
be
accepted
even
if
an
apology
were
offered
in
this
emergency
as
i
understood
it
there
was
but
one
course
to
follow
i
refused
to
receive
the
challenge
being
asked
for
my
reasons
i
found
it
necessary
to
speak
within
certain
limits
though
we
knew
the
general
to
be
a
cheat
it
was
a
delicate
matter
to
dispute
his
right
to
claim
satisfaction
when
he
had
found
two
officers
to
carry
his
message
i
produced
the
seized
cards
which
romayne
had
brought
away
with
him
in
his
pocket
and
offered
them
as
a
formal
proof
that
my
friend
had
not
been
mistaken
the
seconds
evidently
prepared
for
this
circumstance
by
their
principal
declined
to
examine
the
cards
in
the
first
place
they
said
not
even
the
discovery
of
foul
play
supposing
the
discovery
to
have
been
really
made
could
justify
romayne
s
conduct
in
the
second
place
the
general
s
high
character
made
it
impossible
under
any
circumstances
that
he
could
be
responsible
like
ourselves
he
had
rashly
associated
with
bad
company
and
he
had
been
the
innocent
victim
of
an
error
or
a
fraud
committed
by
some
other
person
present
at
the
table
driven
to
my
last
resource
i
could
now
only
base
my
refusal
to
receive
the
challenge
on
the
ground
that
we
were
englishmen
and
that
the
practice
of
dueling
had
been
abolished
in
england
both
the
seconds
at
once
declined
to
accept
this
statement
in
justification
of
my
conduct
you
are
now
in
france
said
the
elder
of
the
two
where
a
duel
is
the
established
remedy
for
an
insult
among
gentlemen
you
are
bound
to
respect
the
social
laws
of
the
country
in
which
you
are
for
the
time
residing
if
you
refuse
to
do
so
you
lay
yourselves
open
to
a
public
imputation
on
your
courage
of
a
nature
too
degrading
to
be
more
particularly
alluded
to
let
us
adjourn
this
interview
for
three
hours
on
the
ground
of
informality
we
ought
to
confer
with
gentlemen
acting
on
romayne
s
behalf
be
prepared
with
another
second
to
meet
us
and
reconsider
your
decision
before
we
call
the
frenchmen
had
barely
taken
their
departure
by
one
door
when
romayne
entered
by
another
i
have
heard
it
all
he
said
quietly
accept
the
i
declare
solemnly
that
i
left
no
means
untried
of
opposing
my
friend
s
resolution
no
man
could
have
felt
more
strongly
convinced
than
i
did
that
nothing
could
justify
the
course
he
was
taking
my
remonstrances
were
completely
thrown
away
he
was
deaf
to
sense
and
reason
from
the
moment
when
he
had
heard
an
imputation
on
his
courage
suggested
as
a
possible
result
of
any
affair
in
which
he
was
concerned
with
your
views
he
said
i
won
t
ask
you
to
accompany
me
to
the
ground
i
can
easily
find
french
seconds
and
mind
this
if
you
attempt
to
prevent
the
meeting
the
duel
will
take
place
elsewhere
and
our
friendship
is
at
an
end
from
that
after
this
i
suppose
it
is
needless
to
add
that
i
accompanied
him
to
the
ground
the
next
morning
as
one
of
his
seconds
we
were
punctual
to
the
appointed
hour
eight
o
clock
the
second
who
acted
with
me
was
a
french
gentleman
a
relative
of
one
of
the
officers
who
had
brought
the
challenge
at
his
suggestion
we
had
chosen
the
pistol
as
our
weapon
romayne
like
most
englishmen
at
the
present
time
knew
nothing
of
the
use
of
the
sword
he
was
almost
equally
inexperienced
with
the
pistol
our
opponents
were
late
they
kept
us
waiting
for
more
than
ten
minutes
it
was
not
pleasant
weather
to
wait
in
the
day
had
dawned
damp
and
drizzling
a
thick
white
fog
was
slowly
rolling
in
on
us
from
the
sea
when
they
did
appear
the
general
was
not
among
them
a
tall
young
man
saluted
romayne
with
stern
courtesy
and
said
to
a
stranger
who
accompanied
him
explain
the
the
stranger
proved
to
be
a
surgeon
he
entered
at
once
on
the
necessary
explanation
the
general
was
too
ill
to
appear
he
had
been
attacked
that
morning
by
a
fit
the
consequence
of
the
blow
that
he
had
received
under
these
circumstances
his
eldest
son
maurice
was
now
on
the
ground
to
fight
the
duel
on
his
father
s
behalf
attended
by
the
general
s
seconds
and
with
the
general
s
full
approval
we
instantly
refused
to
allow
the
duel
to
take
place
romayne
loudly
declaring
that
he
had
no
quarrel
with
the
general
s
son
upon
this
maurice
broke
away
from
his
seconds
drew
off
one
of
his
gloves
and
stepping
close
up
to
romayne
struck
him
on
the
face
with
the
glove
have
you
no
quarrel
with
me
now
the
young
frenchman
asked
must
i
spit
on
you
as
my
father
did
his
seconds
dragged
him
away
and
apologized
to
us
for
the
outbreak
but
the
mischief
was
done
romayne
s
fiery
temper
flashed
in
his
eyes
load
the
pistols
he
said
after
the
insult
publicly
offered
to
him
and
the
outrage
publicly
threatened
there
was
no
other
course
to
take
it
had
been
left
to
us
to
produce
the
pistols
we
therefore
requested
the
seconds
of
our
opponent
to
examine
and
to
load
them
while
this
was
being
done
the
advancing
so
completely
enveloped
us
that
the
duelists
were
unable
to
see
each
other
we
were
obliged
to
wait
for
the
chance
of
a
partial
clearing
in
the
atmosphere
romayne
s
temper
had
become
calm
again
the
generosity
of
his
nature
spoke
in
the
words
which
he
now
addressed
to
his
seconds
after
all
he
said
the
young
man
is
a
good
son
he
is
bent
on
redressing
what
he
believes
to
be
his
father
s
wrong
does
his
flipping
his
glove
in
my
face
matter
to
me
i
think
i
shall
fire
in
the
i
shall
refuse
to
act
as
your
second
if
you
do
answered
the
french
gentleman
who
was
assisting
us
the
general
s
son
is
famous
for
his
skill
with
the
pistol
if
you
didn
t
see
it
in
his
face
just
now
i
did
he
means
to
kill
you
defend
your
life
sir
i
spoke
quite
as
strongly
to
the
same
purpose
when
my
turn
came
romayne
yielded
he
placed
himself
unreservedly
in
our
hands
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
fog
lifted
a
little
we
measured
the
distance
having
previously
arranged
at
my
suggestion
that
the
two
men
should
both
fire
at
the
same
moment
at
a
given
signal
romayne
s
composure
as
they
faced
each
other
was
in
a
man
of
his
irritable
nervous
temperament
really
wonderful
i
placed
him
sidewise
in
a
position
which
in
some
degree
lessened
his
danger
by
lessening
the
surface
exposed
to
the
bullet
my
french
colleague
put
the
pistol
into
his
hand
and
gave
him
the
last
word
of
advice
let
your
arm
hang
loosely
down
with
the
barrel
of
the
pistol
pointing
straight
to
the
ground
when
you
hear
the
signal
only
lift
your
arm
as
far
as
the
elbow
keep
the
elbow
pressed
against
your
side
and
we
could
do
no
more
for
him
as
we
drew
aside
i
own
it
my
tongue
was
like
a
cinder
in
my
mouth
and
a
horrid
inner
cold
crept
through
me
to
the
marrow
of
my
bones
the
signal
was
given
and
the
two
shots
were
fired
at
the
same
time
my
first
look
was
at
romayne
he
took
off
his
hat
and
handed
it
to
me
with
a
smile
his
adversary
s
bullet
had
cut
a
piece
out
of
the
brim
of
his
hat
on
the
right
side
he
had
literally
escaped
by
a
while
i
was
congratulating
him
the
fog
gathered
again
more
thickly
than
ever
looking
anxiously
toward
the
ground
occupied
by
our
adversaries
we
could
only
see
vague
shadowy
forms
hurriedly
crossing
and
recrossing
each
other
in
the
mist
something
had
happened
my
french
colleague
took
my
arm
and
pressed
it
significantly
leave
to
inquire
he
said
romayne
tried
to
follow
i
held
him
back
we
neither
of
us
exchanged
a
word
the
fog
thickened
and
thickened
until
nothing
was
to
be
seen
once
we
heard
the
surgeon
s
voice
calling
impatiently
for
a
light
to
help
him
no
light
appeared
that
could
see
dreary
as
the
fog
itself
the
silence
gathered
round
us
again
on
a
sudden
it
was
broken
horribly
broken
by
another
voice
strange
to
both
of
us
shrieking
hysterically
through
the
impenetrable
mist
where
is
he
the
voice
cried
in
the
french
language
assassin
assassin
where
are
you
was
it
a
woman
or
was
it
a
boy
we
heard
nothing
more
the
effect
upon
romayne
was
terrible
to
see
he
who
had
calmly
confronted
the
weapon
lifted
to
kill
him
shuddered
dumbly
like
a
animal
i
put
my
arm
round
him
and
hurried
him
away
from
the
place
we
waited
at
the
hotel
until
our
french
friend
joined
us
after
a
brief
interval
he
appeared
announcing
that
the
surgeon
would
follow
him
the
duel
had
ended
fatally
the
chance
course
of
the
bullet
urged
by
romayne
s
unpracticed
hand
had
struck
the
general
s
son
just
above
the
right
nostril
had
penetrated
to
the
back
of
his
neck
and
had
communicated
a
fatal
shock
to
the
spinal
marrow
he
was
a
dead
man
before
they
could
take
him
back
to
his
father
s
house
so
far
our
fears
were
confirmed
but
there
was
something
else
to
tell
for
which
our
worst
presentiments
had
not
prepared
us
a
younger
brother
of
the
fallen
man
a
boy
of
thirteen
years
old
had
secretly
followed
the
dueling
party
on
their
way
from
his
father
s
house
had
hidden
himself
and
had
seen
the
dreadful
end
the
seconds
only
knew
of
it
when
he
burst
out
of
his
place
of
concealment
and
fell
on
his
knees
by
his
dying
brother
s
side
his
were
the
frightful
cries
which
we
had
heard
from
invisible
lips
the
slayer
of
his
brother
was
the
assassin
whom
he
had
vainly
tried
to
discover
through
the
fathomless
obscurity
of
the
mist
we
both
looked
at
romayne
he
silently
looked
back
at
us
like
a
man
turned
to
stone
i
tried
to
reason
with
him
your
life
was
at
your
opponent
s
mercy
i
said
it
was
who
was
skilled
in
the
use
of
the
pistol
your
risk
was
infinitely
greater
than
his
are
you
responsible
for
an
accident
rouse
yourself
romayne
think
of
the
time
to
come
when
all
this
will
be
never
he
said
to
the
end
of
my
he
made
that
reply
in
dull
monotonous
tones
his
eyes
looked
wearily
and
vacantly
straight
before
him
i
spoke
to
him
again
he
remained
impenetrably
silent
he
appeared
not
to
hear
or
not
to
understand
me
the
surgeon
came
in
while
i
was
still
at
a
loss
what
to
say
or
do
next
without
waiting
to
be
asked
for
his
opinion
he
observed
romayne
attentively
and
then
drew
me
away
into
the
next
room
your
friend
is
suffering
from
a
severe
nervous
shock
he
said
can
you
tell
me
anything
of
his
habits
of
life
i
mentioned
the
prolonged
night
studies
and
the
excessive
use
of
tea
the
surgeon
shook
his
head
if
you
want
my
advice
he
proceeded
take
him
home
at
once
don
t
subject
him
to
further
excitement
when
the
result
of
the
duel
is
known
in
the
town
if
it
ends
in
our
appearing
in
a
court
of
law
it
will
be
a
mere
formality
in
this
case
and
you
can
surrender
when
the
time
comes
leave
me
your
address
in
i
felt
that
the
wisest
thing
i
could
do
was
to
follow
his
advice
the
boat
crossed
to
folkestone
at
an
early
hour
that
day
we
had
no
time
to
lose
romayne
offered
no
objection
to
our
return
to
england
he
seemed
perfectly
careless
what
became
of
him
leave
me
quiet
he
said
and
do
as
you
i
wrote
a
few
lines
to
lady
berrick
s
medical
attendant
informing
him
of
the
circumstances
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterward
we
were
on
board
the
steamboat
there
were
very
few
passengers
after
we
had
left
the
harbor
my
attention
was
attracted
by
a
young
english
lady
traveling
apparently
with
her
mother
as
we
passed
her
on
the
deck
she
looked
at
romayne
with
compassionate
interest
so
vividly
expressed
in
her
beautiful
face
that
i
imagined
they
might
be
acquainted
with
some
difficulty
i
prevailed
sufficiently
over
the
torpor
that
possessed
him
to
induce
him
to
look
at
our
fellow
passenger
do
you
know
that
charming
person
i
asked
no
he
replied
with
the
weariest
indifference
i
never
saw
her
before
i
m
tired
tired
tired
don
t
speak
to
me
leave
me
by
i
left
him
his
rare
personal
attractions
of
which
let
me
add
he
never
appeared
to
be
conscious
had
evidently
made
their
natural
appeal
to
the
interest
and
admiration
of
the
young
lady
who
had
met
him
by
chance
the
expression
of
resigned
sadness
and
suffering
now
visible
in
his
face
added
greatly
no
doubt
to
the
influence
that
he
had
unconsciously
exercised
over
the
sympathies
of
a
delicate
and
sensitive
woman
it
was
no
uncommon
circumstance
in
his
past
experience
of
the
sex
as
i
myself
well
knew
to
be
the
object
not
of
admiration
only
but
of
true
and
ardent
love
he
had
never
reciprocated
the
passion
had
never
even
appeared
to
take
it
seriously
marriage
might
as
the
phrase
is
be
the
salvation
of
him
would
he
ever
marry
leaning
over
the
bulwark
idly
pursuing
this
train
of
thought
i
was
recalled
to
present
things
by
a
low
sweet
voice
the
voice
of
the
lady
of
whom
i
had
been
thinking
excuse
me
for
disturbing
you
she
said
i
think
your
friend
wants
she
spoke
with
the
modesty
and
of
a
woman
a
little
heightening
of
her
color
made
her
to
my
eyes
more
beautiful
than
ever
i
thanked
her
and
hastened
back
to
romayne
he
was
standing
by
the
barred
skylight
which
guarded
the
machinery
i
instantly
noticed
a
change
in
him
his
eyes
wandering
here
and
there
in
search
of
me
had
more
than
recovered
their
animation
there
was
a
wild
look
of
terror
in
them
he
seized
me
roughly
by
the
arm
and
pointed
down
to
the
what
do
you
hear
there
he
asked
i
hear
the
thump
of
the
nothing
else
nothing
what
do
hear
he
suddenly
turned
away
i
ll
tell
you
he
said
when
we
get
on
second
vange
the
forewarnings
vi
as
we
approached
the
harbor
at
folkestone
romayne
s
agitation
appeared
to
subside
his
head
drooped
his
eyes
half
closed
he
looked
like
a
weary
man
quietly
falling
asleep
on
leaving
the
steamboat
i
ventured
to
ask
our
charming
if
i
could
be
of
any
service
in
reserving
places
in
the
london
train
for
her
mother
and
herself
she
thanked
me
and
said
they
were
going
to
visit
some
friends
at
folkestone
in
making
this
reply
she
looked
at
romayne
i
am
afraid
he
is
very
ill
she
said
in
gently
lowered
tones
before
i
could
answer
her
mother
turned
to
her
with
an
expression
of
surprise
and
directed
her
attention
to
the
friends
whom
she
had
mentioned
waiting
to
greet
her
her
last
look
as
they
took
her
away
rested
tenderly
and
sorrowfully
on
romayne
he
never
returned
it
he
was
not
even
aware
of
it
as
i
led
him
to
the
train
he
leaned
more
and
more
heavily
on
my
arm
seated
in
the
carriage
he
sank
at
once
into
profound
sleep
we
drove
to
the
hotel
at
which
my
friend
was
accustomed
to
reside
when
he
was
in
london
his
long
sleep
on
the
journey
seemed
in
some
degree
to
have
relieved
him
we
dined
together
in
his
private
room
when
the
servants
had
withdrawn
i
found
that
the
unhappy
result
of
the
duel
was
still
preying
on
his
mind
the
horror
of
having
killed
that
man
he
said
is
more
than
i
can
bear
alone
for
god
s
sake
don
t
leave
me
i
had
received
letters
at
boulogne
which
informed
me
that
my
wife
and
family
had
accepted
an
invitation
to
stay
with
some
friends
at
the
under
these
circumstances
i
was
entirely
at
his
service
having
quieted
his
anxiety
on
this
point
i
reminded
him
of
what
had
passed
between
us
on
board
the
steamboat
he
tried
to
change
the
subject
my
curiosity
was
too
strongly
aroused
to
permit
this
i
persisted
in
helping
his
memory
we
were
looking
into
the
i
said
and
you
asked
me
what
i
heard
there
you
promised
to
tell
me
what
heard
as
soon
as
we
got
on
shore
he
stopped
me
before
i
could
say
more
i
begin
to
think
it
was
a
delusion
he
answered
you
ought
not
to
interpret
too
literally
what
a
person
in
my
dreadful
situation
may
say
the
stain
of
another
man
s
blood
is
on
me
i
interrupted
him
in
my
turn
i
refuse
to
hear
you
speak
of
yourself
in
that
way
i
said
you
are
no
more
responsible
for
the
frenchman
s
death
than
if
you
had
been
driving
and
had
accidentally
run
over
him
in
the
street
i
am
not
the
right
companion
for
a
man
who
talks
as
you
do
the
proper
person
to
be
with
you
is
a
i
really
felt
irritated
with
him
and
i
saw
no
reason
for
concealing
it
another
man
in
his
place
might
have
been
offended
with
me
there
was
a
native
sweetness
in
romayne
s
disposition
which
asserted
itself
even
in
his
worst
moments
of
nervous
irritability
he
took
my
hand
don
t
be
hard
on
me
he
pleaded
i
will
try
to
think
of
it
as
you
do
make
some
little
concession
on
your
side
i
want
to
see
how
i
get
through
the
night
we
will
return
to
what
i
said
to
you
on
board
the
steamboat
morning
is
it
agreed
it
was
agreed
of
course
there
was
a
door
of
communication
between
our
bedrooms
at
his
suggestion
it
was
left
open
if
i
find
i
can
t
sleep
he
explained
i
want
to
feel
assured
that
you
can
hear
me
if
i
call
to
three
times
in
the
night
i
woke
and
seeing
the
light
burning
in
his
room
looked
in
at
him
he
always
carried
some
of
his
books
with
him
when
he
traveled
on
each
occasion
when
i
entered
the
room
he
was
reading
quietly
i
suppose
i
forestalled
my
night
s
sleep
on
the
railway
he
said
it
doesn
t
matter
i
am
content
something
that
i
was
afraid
of
has
not
happened
i
am
used
to
wakeful
nights
go
back
to
bed
and
don
t
be
uneasy
about
the
next
morning
the
deferred
explanation
was
put
off
again
do
you
mind
waiting
a
little
longer
he
asked
not
if
you
particularly
wish
will
you
do
me
another
favor
you
know
that
i
don
t
like
london
the
noise
in
the
streets
is
distracting
besides
i
may
tell
you
i
have
a
sort
of
distrust
of
noise
since
he
stopped
with
an
appearance
of
confusion
since
i
found
you
looking
into
the
i
asked
yes
i
don
t
feel
inclined
to
trust
the
chances
of
another
night
in
london
i
want
to
try
the
effect
of
perfect
quiet
do
you
mind
going
back
with
me
to
vange
dull
as
the
place
is
you
can
amuse
yourself
there
is
good
shooting
as
you
in
an
hour
more
we
had
left
london
vii
vange
abbey
is
i
suppose
the
most
solitary
country
house
in
england
if
romayne
wanted
quiet
it
was
exactly
the
place
for
him
on
the
rising
ground
of
one
of
the
wildest
moors
in
the
north
riding
of
yorkshire
the
ruins
of
the
old
monastery
are
visible
from
all
points
of
the
compass
there
are
traditions
of
thriving
villages
clustering
about
the
abbey
in
the
days
of
the
monks
and
of
hostleries
devoted
to
the
reception
of
pilgrims
from
every
part
of
the
christian
world
not
a
vestige
of
these
buildings
is
left
they
were
deserted
by
the
pious
inhabitants
it
is
said
at
the
time
when
henry
the
eighth
suppressed
the
monasteries
and
gave
the
abbey
and
the
broad
lands
of
vange
to
his
faithful
friend
and
courtier
sir
miles
romayne
in
the
next
generation
the
son
and
heir
of
sir
miles
built
the
helping
himself
liberally
from
the
solid
stone
walls
of
the
monastery
with
some
unimportant
alterations
and
repairs
the
house
stands
defying
time
and
weather
to
the
present
day
at
the
last
station
on
the
railway
the
horses
were
waiting
for
us
it
was
a
lovely
moonlight
night
and
we
shortened
the
distance
considerably
by
taking
the
bridle
path
over
the
moor
between
nine
and
ten
o
clock
we
reached
the
abbey
years
had
passed
since
i
had
last
been
romayne
s
guest
nothing
out
of
the
house
or
in
the
house
seemed
to
have
undergone
any
change
in
the
interval
neither
the
good
butler
nor
his
buxom
scotch
wife
skilled
in
cookery
looked
any
older
they
received
me
as
if
i
had
left
them
a
day
or
two
since
and
had
come
back
again
to
live
in
yorkshire
my
bedroom
was
waiting
for
me
and
the
matchless
old
madeira
welcomed
us
when
my
host
and
i
met
in
the
which
was
the
ordinary
of
the
abbey
as
we
faced
each
other
at
the
table
i
began
to
hope
that
the
familiar
influences
of
his
country
home
were
beginning
already
to
breathe
their
blessed
quiet
over
the
disturbed
mind
of
romayne
in
the
presence
of
his
faithful
old
servants
he
seemed
to
be
capable
of
controlling
the
morbid
remorse
that
oppressed
him
he
spoke
to
them
composedly
and
kindly
he
was
affectionately
glad
to
see
his
old
friend
once
more
in
the
old
house
when
we
were
near
the
end
of
our
meal
something
happened
that
startled
me
i
had
just
handed
the
wine
to
romayne
and
he
had
filled
his
glass
when
he
suddenly
turned
pale
and
lifted
his
head
like
a
man
whose
attention
is
unexpectedly
roused
no
person
but
ourselves
was
in
the
room
i
was
not
speaking
to
him
at
the
time
he
looked
round
suspiciously
at
the
door
behind
him
leading
into
the
library
and
rang
the
handbell
which
stood
by
him
on
the
table
the
servant
was
directed
to
close
the
door
are
you
cold
i
asked
he
reconsidered
that
brief
answer
and
contradicted
himself
yes
the
library
fire
has
burned
low
i
in
my
position
at
the
table
i
had
seen
the
fire
the
grate
was
heaped
with
blazing
coals
and
wood
i
said
nothing
the
pale
change
in
his
face
and
his
contradictory
reply
roused
doubts
in
me
which
i
had
hoped
never
to
feel
again
he
pushed
away
his
glass
of
wine
and
still
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
closed
door
his
attitude
and
expression
were
plainly
suggestive
of
the
act
of
listening
listening
to
what
after
an
interval
he
abruptly
addressed
me
do
you
call
it
a
quiet
night
he
said
as
quiet
as
quiet
can
be
i
replied
the
wind
has
dropped
and
even
the
fire
doesn
t
crackle
perfect
stillness
indoors
and
out
he
repeated
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
me
intently
as
if
i
had
started
some
new
idea
in
his
mind
i
asked
as
lightly
as
i
could
if
i
had
said
anything
to
surprise
him
instead
of
answering
me
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
cry
of
terror
and
left
the
room
i
hardly
knew
what
to
do
it
was
impossible
unless
he
returned
immediately
to
let
this
extraordinary
proceeding
pass
without
notice
after
waiting
for
a
few
minutes
i
rang
the
bell
the
old
butler
came
in
he
looked
in
blank
amazement
at
the
empty
chair
where
s
the
master
he
asked
i
could
only
answer
that
he
had
left
the
table
suddenly
without
a
word
of
explanation
he
may
perhaps
be
ill
i
added
as
his
old
servant
you
can
do
no
harm
if
you
go
and
look
for
him
say
that
i
am
waiting
here
if
he
wants
the
minutes
passed
slowly
and
more
slowly
i
was
left
alone
for
so
long
a
time
that
i
began
to
feel
seriously
uneasy
my
hand
was
on
the
bell
again
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
i
had
expected
to
see
the
butler
it
was
the
groom
who
entered
the
room
garthwaite
can
t
come
down
to
you
sir
said
the
man
he
asks
if
you
will
please
go
up
to
the
master
on
the
the
house
extending
round
three
sides
of
a
square
was
only
two
stories
high
the
flat
roof
accessible
through
a
species
of
hatchway
and
still
surrounded
by
its
sturdy
stone
parapet
was
called
the
belvidere
in
reference
as
usual
to
the
fine
view
which
it
commanded
fearing
i
knew
not
what
i
mounted
the
ladder
which
led
to
the
roof
romayne
received
me
with
a
harsh
outburst
of
laughter
that
saddest
false
laughter
which
is
true
trouble
in
disguise
here
s
something
to
amuse
you
he
cried
i
believe
old
garthwaite
thinks
i
am
drunk
he
won
t
leave
me
up
here
by
letting
this
strange
assertion
remain
unanswered
the
butler
withdrew
as
he
passed
me
on
his
way
to
the
ladder
he
whispered
be
careful
of
the
master
i
tell
you
sir
he
has
a
bee
in
his
bonnet
this
although
not
of
the
north
country
myself
i
knew
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
garthwaite
suspected
that
the
master
was
nothing
less
than
mad
romayne
took
my
arm
when
we
were
alone
we
walked
slowly
from
end
to
end
of
the
belvidere
the
moon
was
by
this
time
low
in
the
heavens
but
her
mild
mysterious
light
still
streamed
over
the
roof
of
the
house
and
the
high
heathy
ground
round
it
i
looked
attentively
at
romayne
he
was
deadly
pale
his
hand
shook
as
it
rested
on
my
arm
and
that
was
all
neither
in
look
nor
manner
did
he
betray
the
faintest
sign
of
mental
derangement
he
had
perhaps
needlessly
alarmed
the
faithful
old
servant
by
something
that
he
had
said
or
done
i
determined
to
clear
up
that
doubt
immediately
you
left
the
table
very
suddenly
i
said
did
you
feel
ill
not
ill
he
replied
i
was
frightened
look
at
me
i
m
frightened
what
do
you
mean
instead
of
answering
he
repeated
the
strange
question
which
he
had
put
to
me
downstairs
do
you
call
it
a
quiet
night
considering
the
time
of
year
and
the
exposed
situation
of
the
house
the
night
was
almost
preternaturally
quiet
throughout
the
vast
open
country
all
round
us
not
even
a
breath
of
air
could
be
heard
the
were
away
or
were
silent
at
the
time
but
one
sound
was
audible
when
we
stood
still
and
listened
the
cool
quiet
bubble
of
a
little
stream
lost
to
view
in
the
to
the
south
i
have
told
you
already
i
said
so
still
a
night
i
never
remember
on
this
yorkshire
he
laid
one
hand
heavily
on
my
shoulder
what
did
the
poor
boy
say
of
me
whose
brother
i
killed
he
asked
what
words
did
we
hear
through
the
dripping
darkness
of
the
mist
i
won
t
encourage
you
to
think
of
them
i
refuse
to
repeat
the
he
pointed
over
the
northward
parapet
it
doesn
t
matter
whether
you
accept
or
refuse
he
said
i
hear
the
boy
at
this
moment
there
he
repeated
the
horrid
words
marking
the
pauses
in
the
utterance
of
them
with
his
finger
as
if
they
were
sounds
that
he
heard
assassin
assassin
where
are
you
good
god
i
cried
you
don
t
mean
that
you
really
the
voice
do
you
hear
what
i
say
i
hear
the
boy
as
plainly
as
you
hear
me
the
voice
screams
at
me
through
the
clear
moonlight
as
it
screamed
at
me
through
the
again
and
again
it
s
all
round
the
house
way
now
where
the
light
just
touches
on
the
tops
of
the
heather
tell
the
servants
to
have
the
horses
ready
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
we
leave
vange
abbey
these
were
wild
words
if
he
had
spoken
them
wildly
i
might
have
shared
the
butler
s
conclusion
that
his
mind
was
deranged
there
was
no
undue
vehemence
in
his
voice
or
his
manner
he
spoke
with
a
melancholy
resignation
he
seemed
like
a
prisoner
submitting
to
a
sentence
that
he
had
deserved
remembering
the
cases
of
men
suffering
from
nervous
disease
who
had
been
haunted
by
apparitions
i
asked
if
he
saw
any
imaginary
figure
under
the
form
of
a
boy
i
see
nothing
he
said
i
only
hear
look
yourself
it
is
in
the
last
degree
improbable
but
let
us
make
sure
that
nobody
has
followed
me
from
boulogne
and
is
playing
me
a
we
made
the
circuit
of
the
belvidere
on
its
eastward
side
the
house
wall
was
built
against
one
of
the
towers
of
the
old
abbey
on
the
westward
side
the
ground
sloped
steeply
down
to
a
deep
pool
or
tarn
northward
and
southward
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
open
moor
look
where
i
might
with
the
moonlight
to
make
the
view
plain
to
me
the
solitude
was
as
void
of
any
living
creature
as
if
we
had
been
surrounded
by
the
awful
dead
world
of
the
moon
was
it
the
boy
s
voice
that
you
heard
on
the
voyage
across
the
channel
i
asked
yes
i
heard
it
for
the
first
time
down
in
the
rising
and
falling
rising
and
falling
like
the
sound
of
the
engines
and
when
did
you
hear
it
again
i
feared
to
hear
it
in
london
it
left
me
i
should
have
told
you
when
we
stepped
ashore
out
of
the
steamboat
i
was
afraid
that
the
noise
of
the
traffic
in
the
streets
might
bring
it
back
to
me
as
you
know
i
passed
a
quiet
night
i
had
the
hope
that
my
imagination
had
deceived
me
that
i
was
the
victim
of
a
delusion
as
people
say
it
is
no
delusion
in
the
perfect
tranquillity
of
this
place
the
voice
has
come
back
to
me
while
we
were
at
table
i
heard
it
again
behind
me
in
the
library
i
heard
it
still
when
the
door
was
shut
i
ran
up
here
to
try
if
it
would
follow
me
into
the
open
air
it
followed
me
we
may
as
well
go
down
again
into
the
hall
i
know
now
that
there
is
no
escaping
from
it
my
dear
old
home
has
become
horrible
to
me
do
you
mind
returning
to
london
tomorrow
what
i
felt
and
feared
in
this
miserable
state
of
things
matters
little
the
one
chance
i
could
see
for
romayne
was
to
obtain
the
best
medical
advice
i
sincerely
encouraged
his
idea
of
going
back
to
london
the
next
day
we
had
sat
together
by
the
hall
fire
for
about
ten
minutes
when
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
away
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
drawing
a
deep
breath
of
relief
it
has
gone
he
said
faintly
when
you
hear
the
boy
s
voice
i
asked
do
you
hear
it
continuously
no
at
intervals
sometimes
longer
sometimes
and
thus
far
it
comes
to
you
suddenly
and
leaves
you
suddenly
do
my
questions
annoy
you
i
make
no
complaint
he
said
sadly
you
can
see
for
yourself
i
patiently
suffer
the
punishment
that
i
have
i
contradicted
him
at
once
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
it
s
a
nervous
malady
which
medical
science
can
control
and
cure
wait
till
we
get
to
this
expression
of
opinion
produced
no
effect
on
him
i
have
taken
the
life
of
a
he
said
i
have
closed
the
career
of
a
young
man
who
but
for
me
might
have
lived
long
and
happily
and
honorably
say
what
you
may
i
am
of
the
race
of
cain
had
the
mark
set
on
his
brow
i
have
ordeal
delude
yourself
if
you
like
with
false
hopes
i
can
endure
and
hope
for
nothing
viii
early
the
next
morning
the
good
old
butler
came
to
me
in
great
perturbation
for
a
word
of
advice
do
come
sir
and
look
at
the
master
i
can
t
find
it
in
my
heart
to
wake
it
was
time
to
wake
him
if
we
were
to
go
to
london
that
day
i
went
into
the
bedroom
although
i
was
no
doctor
the
restorative
importance
of
that
profound
and
quiet
sleep
impressed
itself
on
me
so
strongly
that
i
took
the
responsibility
of
leaving
him
undisturbed
the
event
proved
that
i
had
acted
wisely
he
slept
until
noon
there
was
no
return
of
the
torment
of
the
voice
as
he
called
it
poor
fellow
we
passed
a
quiet
day
excepting
one
little
interruption
which
i
am
warned
not
to
pass
over
without
a
word
of
record
in
this
narrative
we
had
returned
from
a
ride
romayne
had
gone
into
the
library
to
read
and
i
was
just
leaving
the
stables
after
a
look
at
some
recent
improvements
when
a
with
a
gentleman
in
it
drove
up
to
the
door
he
asked
politely
if
he
might
be
allowed
to
see
the
house
there
were
some
fine
pictures
at
vange
as
well
as
many
interesting
relics
of
antiquity
and
the
rooms
were
shown
in
romayne
s
absence
to
the
very
few
travelers
who
were
adventurous
enough
to
cross
the
heathy
desert
that
surrounded
the
abbey
on
this
occasion
the
stranger
was
informed
that
romayne
was
at
home
he
at
once
apologized
with
an
appearance
of
disappointment
however
which
induced
me
to
step
forward
and
speak
to
him
mr
romayne
is
not
very
well
i
said
and
i
can
not
venture
to
ask
you
into
the
house
but
you
will
be
welcome
i
am
sure
to
walk
round
the
grounds
and
to
look
at
the
ruins
of
the
he
thanked
me
and
accepted
the
invitation
i
find
no
great
difficulty
in
describing
him
generally
he
was
elderly
fat
and
cheerful
buttoned
up
in
a
long
black
frockcoat
and
presenting
that
closely
shaven
face
and
that
inveterate
expression
of
watchful
humility
about
the
eyes
which
we
all
associate
with
the
reverend
personality
of
a
priest
to
my
surprise
he
seemed
in
some
degree
at
least
to
know
his
way
about
the
place
he
made
straight
for
the
dreary
little
lake
which
i
have
already
mentioned
and
stood
looking
at
it
with
an
interest
which
was
so
incomprehensible
to
me
that
i
own
i
watched
him
he
ascended
the
slope
of
the
moorland
and
entered
the
gate
which
led
to
the
grounds
all
that
the
gardeners
had
done
to
make
the
place
attractive
failed
to
claim
his
attention
he
walked
past
lawns
shrubs
and
and
only
stopped
at
an
old
stone
fountain
which
tradition
declared
to
have
been
one
of
the
ornaments
of
the
garden
in
the
time
of
the
monks
having
carefully
examined
this
relic
of
antiquity
he
took
a
sheet
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
consulted
it
attentively
it
might
have
been
a
plan
of
the
house
and
grounds
or
it
might
not
i
can
only
report
that
he
took
the
path
which
led
him
by
the
shortest
way
to
the
ruined
abbey
church
as
he
entered
the
roofless
inclosure
he
reverently
removed
his
hat
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
follow
him
any
further
without
exposing
myself
to
the
risk
of
discovery
i
sat
down
on
one
of
the
fallen
stones
waiting
to
see
him
again
it
must
have
been
at
least
half
an
hour
before
he
appeared
he
thanked
me
for
my
kindness
as
composedly
as
if
he
had
quite
expected
to
find
me
in
the
place
that
i
occupied
i
have
been
deeply
interested
in
all
that
i
have
seen
he
said
may
i
venture
to
ask
what
is
perhaps
an
indiscreet
question
on
the
part
of
a
stranger
i
ventured
on
my
side
to
inquire
what
the
question
might
be
mr
romayne
is
indeed
fortunate
he
resumed
in
the
possession
of
this
beautiful
place
he
is
a
young
man
i
think
is
he
married
excuse
my
curiosity
the
owner
of
vange
abbey
is
an
interesting
person
to
all
good
antiquaries
like
myself
many
thanks
again
his
took
him
away
his
last
look
rested
not
on
me
but
on
the
old
abbey
ix
my
record
of
events
approaches
its
conclusion
on
the
next
day
we
returned
to
the
hotel
in
london
at
romayne
s
suggestion
i
sent
the
same
evening
to
my
own
house
for
any
letters
which
might
be
waiting
for
me
his
mind
still
dwelt
on
the
duel
he
was
morbidly
eager
to
know
if
any
communication
had
been
received
from
the
french
surgeon
when
the
messenger
returned
with
my
letters
the
boulogne
postmark
was
on
one
of
the
envelopes
at
romayne
s
entreaty
this
was
the
letter
that
i
opened
first
the
surgeon
s
signature
was
at
the
end
one
motive
for
anxiety
on
my
part
was
set
at
rest
in
the
first
lines
after
an
official
inquiry
into
the
circumstances
the
french
authorities
had
decided
that
it
was
not
expedient
to
put
the
survivor
of
the
duelists
on
his
trial
before
a
court
of
law
no
jury
hearing
the
evidence
would
find
him
guilty
of
the
only
charge
that
could
be
formally
brought
against
him
the
charge
of
homicide
by
homicide
by
misadventure
occurring
in
a
duel
was
not
a
punishable
offense
by
the
french
law
my
correspondent
cited
many
cases
in
proof
of
it
strengthened
by
the
opinion
of
the
illustrious
berryer
himself
in
a
word
we
had
nothing
to
fear
the
next
page
of
the
letter
informed
us
that
the
police
had
surprised
the
card
playing
community
with
whom
we
had
spent
the
evening
at
boulogne
and
that
the
old
landlady
had
been
sent
to
prison
for
the
offense
of
keeping
a
it
was
suspected
in
the
town
that
the
general
was
more
or
less
directly
connected
with
certain
disreputable
circumstances
discovered
by
the
authorities
in
any
case
he
had
retired
from
active
service
he
and
his
wife
and
family
had
left
boulogne
and
had
gone
away
in
debt
no
investigation
had
thus
far
succeeded
in
discovering
the
place
of
their
retreat
reading
this
letter
aloud
to
romayne
i
was
interrupted
by
him
at
the
last
sentence
the
inquiries
must
have
been
carelessly
made
he
said
i
will
see
to
it
what
interest
can
you
have
in
the
inquiries
i
exclaimed
the
strongest
possible
interest
he
answered
it
has
been
my
one
hope
to
make
some
little
atonement
to
the
poor
people
whom
i
have
so
cruelly
wronged
if
the
wife
and
children
are
in
distressed
circumstances
which
seems
to
be
only
too
likely
i
may
place
them
beyond
the
reach
of
anxiety
anonymously
of
course
give
me
the
surgeon
s
address
i
shall
write
instructions
for
tracing
them
at
my
expense
merely
announcing
that
an
unknown
friend
desires
to
be
of
service
to
the
general
s
this
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
most
imprudent
thing
to
do
i
said
so
plainly
and
quite
in
vain
with
his
customary
impetuosity
he
wrote
the
letter
at
once
and
sent
it
to
the
post
that
night
x
on
the
question
of
submitting
himself
to
medical
advice
which
i
now
earnestly
pressed
upon
him
romayne
was
disposed
to
be
equally
unreasonable
but
in
this
case
events
declared
themselves
in
my
favor
lady
berrick
s
last
reserves
of
strength
had
given
way
she
had
been
brought
to
london
in
a
dying
state
while
we
were
at
vange
abbey
romayne
was
summoned
to
his
aunt
s
bedside
on
the
third
day
of
our
residence
at
the
hotel
and
was
present
at
her
death
the
impression
produced
on
his
mind
roused
the
better
part
of
his
nature
he
was
more
distrustful
of
himself
more
accessible
to
persuasion
than
usual
in
this
gentler
frame
of
mind
he
received
a
welcome
visit
from
an
old
friend
to
whom
he
was
sincerely
attached
the
visit
of
no
great
importance
in
itself
led
as
i
have
since
been
informed
to
very
serious
events
in
romayne
s
later
life
for
this
reason
i
briefly
relate
what
took
place
within
my
own
healing
lord
loring
well
known
in
society
as
the
head
of
an
old
english
catholic
family
and
the
possessor
of
a
magnificent
gallery
of
pictures
was
distressed
by
the
change
for
the
worse
which
he
perceived
in
romayne
when
he
called
at
the
hotel
i
was
present
when
they
met
and
rose
to
leave
the
room
feeling
that
the
two
friends
might
perhaps
be
embarrassed
by
the
presence
of
a
third
person
romayne
called
me
back
lord
loring
ought
to
know
what
has
happened
to
me
he
said
i
have
no
heart
to
speak
of
it
myself
tell
him
everything
and
if
he
agrees
with
you
i
will
submit
to
see
the
with
those
words
he
left
us
together
it
is
almost
needless
to
say
that
lord
loring
did
agree
with
me
he
was
himself
disposed
to
think
that
the
moral
remedy
in
romayne
s
case
might
prove
to
be
the
best
remedy
with
submission
to
what
the
doctors
may
decide
his
lordship
said
the
right
thing
to
do
in
my
opinion
is
to
divert
our
friend
s
mind
from
himself
i
see
a
plain
necessity
for
making
a
complete
change
in
the
solitary
life
that
he
has
been
leading
for
years
past
why
shouldn
t
he
marry
a
woman
s
influence
by
merely
giving
a
new
turn
to
his
thoughts
might
charm
away
that
horrible
voice
which
haunts
him
perhaps
you
think
this
a
merely
sentimental
view
of
the
case
look
at
it
practically
if
you
like
and
you
come
to
the
same
conclusion
with
that
fine
estate
and
with
the
fortune
which
he
has
now
inherited
from
his
aunt
it
is
his
duty
to
marry
don
t
you
agree
with
me
i
agree
most
cordially
but
i
see
serious
difficulties
in
your
lordship
s
way
romayne
dislikes
society
and
as
to
marrying
his
coldness
toward
women
seems
so
far
as
i
can
judge
to
be
one
of
the
incurable
defects
of
his
lord
loring
smiled
my
dear
sir
nothing
of
that
sort
is
incurable
if
we
can
only
find
the
right
the
tone
in
which
he
spoke
suggested
to
me
that
he
had
got
the
right
woman
and
i
took
the
liberty
of
saying
so
he
at
once
acknowledged
that
i
had
guessed
right
romayne
is
as
you
say
a
difficult
subject
to
deal
with
he
resumed
if
i
commit
the
slightest
imprudence
i
shall
excite
his
suspicion
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
my
hope
of
being
of
service
to
him
i
shall
proceed
carefully
i
can
tell
you
luckily
poor
dear
fellow
he
is
fond
of
pictures
it
s
quite
natural
that
i
should
ask
him
to
see
some
recent
additions
to
my
gallery
isn
t
it
there
is
the
trap
that
i
set
i
have
a
sweet
girl
to
tempt
him
staying
at
my
house
who
is
a
little
out
of
health
and
spirits
herself
at
the
right
moment
i
shall
send
word
upstairs
she
may
well
happen
to
look
in
at
the
gallery
by
the
merest
accident
just
at
the
time
when
romayne
is
looking
at
my
new
pictures
the
rest
depends
of
course
on
the
effect
she
produces
if
you
knew
her
i
believe
you
would
agree
with
me
that
the
experiment
is
worth
not
knowing
the
lady
i
had
little
faith
in
the
success
of
the
experiment
no
one
however
could
doubt
lord
loring
s
admirable
devotion
to
his
friend
and
with
that
i
was
fain
to
be
content
when
romayne
returned
to
us
it
was
decided
to
submit
his
case
to
a
consultation
of
physicians
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
when
lord
loring
took
his
departure
i
accompanied
him
to
the
door
of
the
hotel
perceiving
that
he
wished
to
say
a
word
more
to
me
in
private
he
had
it
seemed
decided
on
waiting
for
the
result
of
the
medical
consultation
before
he
tried
the
effect
of
the
young
lady
s
attractions
and
he
wished
to
caution
me
against
speaking
prematurely
of
visiting
the
picture
gallery
to
our
friend
not
feeling
particularly
interested
in
these
details
of
the
worthy
nobleman
s
little
plot
i
looked
at
his
carriage
and
privately
admired
the
two
splendid
horses
that
drew
it
the
footman
opened
the
door
for
his
master
and
i
became
aware
for
the
first
time
that
a
gentleman
had
accompanied
lord
loring
to
the
hotel
and
had
waited
for
him
in
the
carriage
the
gentleman
bent
forward
and
looked
up
from
a
book
that
he
was
reading
to
my
astonishment
i
recognized
the
elderly
fat
and
cheerful
priest
who
had
shown
such
a
knowledge
of
localities
and
such
an
extraordinary
interest
in
vange
abbey
it
struck
me
as
an
odd
coincidence
that
i
should
see
the
man
again
in
london
so
soon
after
i
had
met
with
him
in
yorkshire
this
was
all
i
thought
about
it
at
the
time
if
i
had
known
then
what
i
know
now
i
might
have
dreamed
let
us
say
of
throwing
that
priest
into
the
lake
at
vange
and
might
have
reckoned
the
circumstance
among
the
opportunities
of
my
life
to
return
to
the
serious
interests
of
the
present
narrative
i
may
now
announce
that
my
evidence
as
an
of
events
has
come
to
an
end
the
day
after
lord
loring
s
visit
domestic
troubles
separated
me
to
my
most
sincere
regret
from
romayne
i
have
only
to
add
that
the
foregoing
narrative
of
personal
experience
has
been
written
with
a
due
sense
of
responsibility
and
that
it
may
be
depended
on
throughout
as
an
exact
statement
of
the
truth

in

one
of

palatial
houses
which
are
situated
on
the
north
side
of
hyde
park
two
ladies
sat
at
breakfast
and
gossiped
over
their
tea
the
elder
of
the
two
was
lady
loring
still
in
the
prime
of
life
possessed
of
the
golden
hair
and
the
clear
blue
eyes
the
complexion
and
the
freely
developed
figure
which
are
among
the
favorite
attractions
popularly
associated
with
the
beauty
of
englishwomen
her
younger
companion
was
the
unknown
lady
admired
by
major

on
the
sea
passage
from

to

with
hair
and
eyes
of
the
darkest
brown
with
a
pure
pallor
of
complexion
only
changing
to
a
faint
rose
tint
in
moments
of
agitation
with
a
tall
graceful
figure
incompletely
developed
in
substance
and
strength
she
presented
an
almost
complete
contrast
to
lady
loring
two
more
opposite
types
of
beauty
it
would
have
been
hardly
possible
to
place
at
the
same
table
the
servant
brought
in
the
letters
of
the
morning
lady
loring
ran
through
her
correspondence
rapidly
pushed
away
the
letters
in
a
heap
and
poured
herself
out
a
second
cup
of
tea
nothing
interesting
this
morning
for
me
she
said

news
of

the

handed
an

letter
to

with
a
faint
smile
see
for
yourself
adelaide
she
answered
with
the
tender
sweetness
of
tone
which
made
her
voice
irresistibly
charming
and
tell
me
if
there
were
ever
two
women
so
utterly
unlike
each
other
as
my
mother
and
lady
loring
ran
through
the
letter
as
she
had
run
through
her
own
correspondence

remarked
with
grave
irony
as
she
returned
the
letter
don
t
even
speak
of
it
said
stella
i
really
know
no
life
that
i
should
not
prefer
to
the
life
that
my

is
enjoying
at
this
moment
what
should
i
have
done
adelaide
if
you
had
not
offered
me
a
happy
refuge
in
your
house
earthly
paradise
is
here
where
i
am
allowed
to
dream
away
my
time
over
my
drawings
and
my
books
and
to
resign
myself
to
poor
health
and
low
spirits
without
being
dragged
into
society
and
worse
still
threatened
with
that
medical
advice
in
which
when
she
isn
t
threatened
with
it
herself
my
poor
dear
mother
believes
so
implicitly
i
wish
you
would
hire
me
as
your
companion
and
let
me
stay
here
for
the
rest
of
my
lady
loring
s
bright
face
became
grave
while
stella
was
speaking
my
dear
she
said
kindly
i
know
well
how
you
love
retirement
and
how
differently
you
think
and
feel
from
other
young
women
of
your
age
and
i
am
far
from
forgetting
what
sad
circumstances
have
encouraged
the
natural
bent
of
your
disposition
but
since
you
have
been
staying
with
me
this
time
i
see
something
in
you
which
my
intimate
knowledge
of
your
character
fails
to
explain
we
have
been
friends
since
we
were
together
at
school
and
in
those
old
days
we
never
had
any
secrets
from
each
other
you
are
feeling
some
anxiety
or
brooding
over
some
sorrow
of
which
i
know
nothing
i
don
t
ask
for
your
confidence
i
only
tell
you
what
i
have
noticed
and
i
say
with
all
my
heart
stella
i
am
sorry
for
she
rose
and
with
intuitive
delicacy
changed
the
subject
i
am
going
out
earlier
than
usual
this
morning
she
resumed
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
she
laid
her
hand
tenderly
on
stella
s
shoulder
waiting
for
the
reply
stella
lifted
the
hand
and
kissed
it
with
passionate
fondness
don
t
think
me
ungrateful
she
said
i
am
only
her
head
sank
on
her
bosom
she
burst
into
tears
lady
loring
waited
by
her
in
silence
she
well
knew
the
girl
s
nature
always
shrinking
except
in
moments
of
violent
emotion
from
the
outward
betrayal
of
its
trials
and
its
sufferings
to
others
the
true
depth
of
feeling
which
is
marked
by
this
inbred
modesty
is
most
frequently
found
in
men
the
few
women
who
possess
it
are
without
the
communicative
consolations
of
the
feminine
heart
they
are
the
noblest
but
too
often
the
unhappiest
of
their
sex
will
you
wait
a
little
before
you
go
out
stella
asked
softly
lady
loring
returned
to
the
chair
that
she
had
left
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
drew
it
nearer
to
stella
shall
i
sit
by
you
she
said
close
by
me
you
spoke
of
our
school
days
just
now
adelaide
there
was
some
difference
between
us
of
all
the
girls
i
was
the
youngest
and
you
were
the
eldest
or
nearly
the
eldest
i
think
quite
the
eldest
my
dear
there
is
a
difference
of
ten
years
between
us
but
why
do
you
go
back
to
that
it
s
only
a
recollection
my
father
was
alive
then
i
was
at
first
and
frightened
in
the
strange
place
among
the
big
girls
you
used
to
let
me
hide
my
face
on
your
shoulder
and
tell
me
stories
may
i
hide
in
the
old
way
and
tell
story
she
was
now
the
calmest
of
the
two
the
elder
woman
turned
a
little
pale
and
looked
down
in
silent
anxiety
at
the
darkly
beautiful
head
that
rested
on
her
shoulder
after
such
an
experience
as
mine
has
been
said
stella
would
you
think
it
possible
that
i
could
ever
again
feel
my
heart
troubled
by
a
man
and
that
man
a
stranger
my
dear
i
think
it
quite
possible
you
are
only
now
in
your
year
you
were
innocent
of
all
blame
at
that
wretched
time
which
you
ought
never
to
speak
of
again
love
and
be
happy
stella
if
you
can
only
find
the
man
who
is
worthy
of
you
but
you
frighten
me
when
you
speak
of
a
stranger
where
did
you
meet
with
him
on
our
way
back
from
traveling
in
the
same
carriage
with
you
no
it
was
in
crossing
the
channel
there
were
few
travelers
in
the
steamboat
or
i
might
never
have
noticed
did
he
speak
to
you
i
don
t
think
he
even
looked
at
that
doesn
t
say
much
for
his
taste
you
don
t
understand
i
mean
i
have
not
explained
myself
properly
he
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
friend
weak
and
worn
and
wasted
as
i
supposed
by
some
long
and
dreadful
illness
there
was
an
angelic
sweetness
in
his
face
such
patience
such
resignation
for
heaven
s
sake
keep
my
secret
one
hears
of
men
falling
in
love
with
women
at
first
sight
but
a
woman
who
looks
at
a
man
and
feels
oh
it
s
shameful
i
could
hardly
take
my
eyes
off
him
if
he
had
looked
at
me
in
return
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
have
done
i
burn
when
i
think
of
it
he
was
absorbed
in
his
suffering
and
his
sorrow
my
last
look
at
his
beautiful
face
was
on
the
pier
before
they
took
me
away
the
perfect
image
of
him
has
been
in
my
heart
ever
since
in
my
dreams
i
see
him
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
now
don
t
despise
me
adelaide
my
dear
you
interest
me
indescribably
do
you
suppose
he
was
in
our
rank
of
life
i
mean
of
course
did
he
look
like
a
gentleman
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
do
try
to
describe
him
stella
was
he
tall
and
well
dressed
neither
tall
nor
short
rather
thin
quiet
and
graceful
in
all
his
movements
dressed
plainly
in
perfect
taste
how
can
i
describe
him
when
his
friend
brought
him
on
board
he
stood
at
the
side
of
the
vessel
looking
out
thoughtfully
toward
the
sea
such
eyes
i
never
saw
before
adelaide
in
any
human
face
so
divinely
tender
and
sad
and
the
color
of
them
that
dark
violet
blue
so
uncommon
and
so
beautiful
too
beautiful
for
a
man
i
may
say
the
same
of
his
hair
i
saw
it
completely
for
a
minute
or
two
he
removed
his
hat
his
head
was
fevered
i
think
and
he
let
the
sea
breeze
blow
over
it
the
pure
light
brown
of
his
hair
was
just
warmed
by
a
lovely
reddish
tinge
his
beard
was
of
the
same
color
short
and
curling
like
the
beards
of
the
roman
heroes
one
sees
in
pictures
i
shall
never
see
him
again
and
it
is
best
for
me
that
i
shall
not
what
can
i
hope
from
a
man
who
never
once
noticed
me
but
i
like
to
hear
that
he
had
recovered
his
health
and
his
tranquillity
and
that
his
life
was
a
happy
one
it
has
been
a
comfort
to
me
adelaide
to
open
my
heart
to
you
i
am
getting
bold
enough
to
confess
everything
would
you
laugh
at
me
i
wonder
if
i
she
stopped
her
pale
complexion
softly
glowed
into
color
her
grand
dark
eyes
brightened
she
looked
her
loveliest
at
that
moment
i
am
far
more
inclined
stella
to
cry
over
you
than
to
laugh
at
you
said
lady
loring
there
is
something
to
my
mind
very
sad
about
this
adventure
of
yours
i
wish
i
could
find
out
who
the
man
is
even
the
best
description
of
a
person
falls
so
short
of
the
reality
i
thought
of
showing
you
something
stella
continued
which
might
help
you
to
see
him
as
i
saw
him
it
s
only
making
one
more
acknowledgment
of
my
own
you
don
t
mean
a
portrait
of
him
lady
loring
exclaimed
the
best
that
i
could
do
from
recollection
stella
answered
sadly
bring
it
here
directly
stella
left
the
room
and
returned
with
a
little
drawing
in
pencil
the
instant
lady
loring
looked
at
it
she
recognized
romayne
and
started
excitedly
to
her
feet
you
know
him
cried
stella
lady
loring
had
placed
herself
in
an
awkward
position
her
husband
had
described
to
her
his
interview
with
major
hynd
and
had
mentioned
his
project
for
bringing
romayne
and
stella
together
after
first
exacting
a
promise
of
the
strictest
secrecy
from
his
wife
she
felt
herself
bound
doubly
bound
after
what
she
had
now
discovered
to
respect
the
confidence
placed
in
her
and
this
at
the
time
when
she
had
betrayed
herself
to
stella
with
a
woman
s
feline
fineness
of
perception
in
all
cases
of
subterfuge
and
concealment
she
picked
a
part
of
the
truth
out
of
the
whole
and
answered
harmlessly
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
i
have
certainly
seen
him
she
said
probably
at
some
party
but
i
see
so
many
people
and
i
go
to
so
many
places
that
i
must
ask
for
time
to
consult
my
memory
my
husband
might
help
me
if
you
don
t
object
to
my
asking
him
she
added
slyly
stella
snatched
the
drawing
away
from
her
in
terror
you
don
t
mean
that
you
will
tell
lord
loring
she
said
my
dear
child
how
can
you
be
so
foolish
can
t
i
show
him
the
drawing
without
mentioning
who
it
was
done
by
his
memory
is
a
much
better
one
than
mine
if
i
say
to
him
where
did
we
meet
that
man
he
may
tell
me
at
once
he
may
even
remember
the
name
of
course
if
you
like
to
be
kept
in
suspense
you
have
only
to
say
so
it
rests
with
you
to
poor
stella
gave
way
directly
she
returned
the
drawing
and
affectionately
kissed
her
artful
friend
having
now
secured
the
means
of
consulting
her
husband
without
exciting
suspicion
lady
loring
left
the
room
at
that
time
in
the
morning
lord
loring
was
generally
to
be
found
either
in
the
library
or
the
picture
gallery
his
wife
tried
the
library
first
on
entering
the
room
she
found
but
one
person
in
it
not
the
person
of
whom
she
was
in
search
there
buttoned
up
in
his
long
frock
coat
and
surrounded
by
books
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
sat
the
plump
elderly
priest
who
had
been
the
especial
object
of
major
hynd
s
aversion
i
beg
your
pardon
father
benwell
said
lady
loring
i
hope
i
don
t
interrupt
your
studies
father
benwell
rose
and
bowed
with
a
pleasant
paternal
smile
i
am
only
trying
to
organize
an
improved
arrangement
of
the
library
he
said
simply
books
are
companionable
creatures
members
as
it
were
of
his
family
to
a
lonely
old
priest
like
myself
can
i
be
of
any
service
to
your
ladyship
thank
you
father
if
you
can
kindly
tell
me
where
lord
loring
is
to
be
sure
his
lordship
was
here
five
minutes
since
he
is
now
in
the
picture
gallery
pray
permit
me
with
a
remarkably
light
and
easy
step
for
a
man
of
his
age
and
size
he
advanced
to
the
further
end
of
the
library
and
opened
a
door
which
led
into
the
gallery
lord
loring
is
among
the
pictures
he
announced
and
he
laid
a
certain
emphasis
on
the
last
word
which
might
or
might
not
in
the
case
of
a
spiritual
director
of
the
household
invite
a
word
of
explanation
lady
loring
merely
said
just
what
i
wanted
thank
you
once
more
father
benwell
and
passed
into
the
picture
gallery
left
by
himself
again
in
the
library
the
priest
walked
slowly
to
and
fro
thinking
his
latent
power
and
resolution
began
to
show
themselves
darkly
in
his
face
a
skilled
observer
would
now
have
seen
plainly
revealed
in
him
the
habit
of
command
and
the
capacity
for
insisting
on
his
right
to
be
obeyed
from
head
to
foot
father
benwell
was
one
of
those
valuable
soldiers
of
the
church
who
acknowledge
no
defeat
and
who
improve
every
victory
after
a
while
he
returned
to
the
table
at
which
he
had
been
writing
when
lady
loring
entered
the
room
an
unfinished
letter
lay
open
on
the
desk
he
took
up
his
pen
and
completed
it
in
these
words
i
have
therefore
decided
on
trusting
this
serious
matter
in
the
hands
of
arthur
penrose
i
know
he
is
young
but
we
have
to
set
against
the
drawback
of
his
youth
the
of
his
incorruptible
honesty
and
his
true
religious
zeal
no
better
man
is
just
now
within
my
reach
and
there
is
no
time
to
lose
romayne
has
recently
inherited
a
large
increase
of
fortune
he
will
be
the
object
of
the
basest
conspiracies
conspiracies
of
men
to
win
his
money
and
worse
still
of
women
to
marry
him
even
these
contemptible
efforts
may
be
obstacles
in
the
way
of
our
righteous
purpose
unless
we
are
first
in
the
field
penrose
left
oxford
last
week
i
expect
him
here
this
morning
by
my
invitation
when
i
have
given
him
the
necessary
instructions
and
have
found
the
means
of
favorably
introducing
him
to
romayne
i
shall
have
the
honor
of
forwarding
a
statement
of
our
prospects
so
having
signed
these
lines
he
addressed
the
letter
to
the
reverend
the
secretary
society
of
jesus
as
he
closed
and
sealed
the
envelope
a
servant
opened
the
door
communicating
with
the
hall
and
announced
mr
arthur
chapter
ii
the
jesuits
father
benwell
rose
and
welcomed
the
visitor
with
his
paternal
smile
i
am
heartily
glad
to
see
you
he
said
and
held
out
his
hand
with
a
becoming
mixture
of
dignity
and
cordiality
penrose
lifted
the
offered
hand
respectfully
to
his
lips
as
one
of
the
provincials
of
the
order
father
benwell
occupied
a
high
place
among
the
english
jesuits
he
was
accustomed
to
acts
of
homage
offered
by
his
younger
brethren
to
their
spiritual
chief
i
fear
you
are
not
well
he
proceeded
gently
your
hand
is
feverish
thank
you
father
i
am
as
well
as
depression
of
spirits
perhaps
father
benwell
persisted
penrose
admitted
it
with
a
passing
smile
my
spirits
are
never
very
lively
he
said
father
benwell
shook
his
head
in
gentle
disapproval
of
a
depressed
state
of
spirits
in
a
young
man
this
must
be
corrected
he
remarked
cultivate
cheerfulness
arthur
i
am
myself
thank
god
a
naturally
cheerful
man
my
mind
reflects
in
some
degree
and
reflects
gratefully
the
brightness
and
beauty
which
are
part
of
the
great
scheme
of
creation
a
similar
disposition
is
to
be
cultivated
i
know
instances
of
it
in
my
own
experience
add
one
more
instance
and
you
will
really
gratify
me
in
its
seasons
of
rejoicing
our
church
is
eminently
cheerful
shall
i
add
another
encouragement
a
great
trust
is
about
to
be
placed
in
you
be
socially
agreeable
or
you
will
fail
to
justify
the
trust
this
is
father
benwell
s
little
sermon
i
think
it
has
a
merit
arthur
it
is
a
sermon
soon
penrose
looked
up
at
his
superior
eager
to
hear
more
he
was
a
very
young
man
his
large
thoughtful
gray
eyes
and
his
habitual
refinement
and
modesty
of
manner
gave
a
certain
attraction
to
his
personal
appearance
of
which
it
stood
in
some
need
in
stature
he
was
little
and
lean
his
hair
had
become
prematurely
thin
over
his
broad
forehead
there
were
hollows
already
in
his
cheeks
and
marks
on
either
side
of
his
thin
delicate
lips
he
looked
like
a
person
who
had
passed
many
miserable
hours
in
needlessly
despairing
of
himself
and
his
prospects
with
all
this
there
was
something
in
him
so
irresistibly
truthful
and
sincere
so
suggestive
even
where
he
might
be
wrong
of
a
purely
conscientious
belief
in
his
own
errors
that
he
attached
people
to
him
without
an
effort
and
often
without
being
aware
of
it
himself
what
would
his
friends
have
said
if
they
had
been
told
that
the
religious
enthusiasm
of
this
gentle
melancholy
man
might
in
its
very
innocence
of
suspicion
and
be
perverted
to
dangerous
uses
in
unscrupulous
hands
his
friends
would
one
and
all
have
received
the
scandalous
assertion
with
contempt
and
penrose
himself
if
he
had
heard
of
it
might
have
failed
to
control
his
temper
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
may
i
ask
a
question
without
giving
offense
he
said
timidly
father
benwell
took
his
hand
my
dear
arthur
let
us
open
our
minds
to
each
other
without
reserve
what
is
your
question
you
have
spoken
father
of
a
great
trust
that
is
about
to
be
placed
in
yes
you
are
anxious
no
doubt
to
hear
what
it
is
i
am
anxious
to
know
in
the
first
place
if
it
requires
me
to
go
back
to
father
benwell
dropped
his
young
friend
s
hand
do
you
dislike
oxford
he
asked
observing
penrose
attentively
bear
with
me
father
if
i
speak
too
confidently
i
dislike
the
deception
which
has
obliged
me
to
conceal
that
i
am
a
catholic
and
a
father
benwell
set
this
little
difficulty
right
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
could
make
benevolent
allowance
for
unreasonable
scruples
i
think
arthur
you
forget
two
important
considerations
he
said
in
the
first
place
you
have
a
dispensation
from
your
superiors
which
absolves
you
of
all
responsibility
in
respect
of
the
concealment
that
you
have
practiced
in
the
second
place
we
could
only
obtain
information
of
the
progress
which
our
church
is
silently
making
at
the
university
by
employing
you
in
the
capacity
of
let
me
say
an
independent
observer
however
if
it
will
contribute
to
your
ease
of
mind
i
see
no
objection
to
informing
you
that
you
will
be
instructed
to
return
to
oxford
do
i
relieve
you
there
could
be
no
question
of
it
penrose
breathed
more
freely
in
every
sense
of
the
word
at
the
same
time
father
benwell
continued
let
us
not
misunderstand
each
other
in
the
new
sphere
of
action
which
we
design
for
you
you
will
not
only
be
at
liberty
to
acknowledge
that
you
are
a
catholic
it
will
be
absolutely
necessary
that
you
should
do
so
but
you
will
continue
to
wear
the
ordinary
dress
of
an
english
gentleman
and
to
preserve
the
strictest
secrecy
on
the
subject
of
your
admission
to
the
priesthood
until
you
are
further
advised
by
myself
now
dear
arthur
read
that
paper
it
is
the
necessary
preface
to
all
that
i
have
yet
to
say
to
the
paper
contained
a
few
pages
of
manuscript
relating
the
early
history
of
vange
abbey
in
the
days
of
the
monks
and
the
circumstances
under
which
the
property
was
confiscated
to
lay
uses
in
the
time
of
henry
the
eighth
penrose
handed
back
the
little
narrative
vehemently
expressing
his
sympathy
with
the
monks
and
his
detestation
of
the
king
compose
yourself
arthur
said
father
benwell
smiling
pleasantly
we
don
t
mean
to
allow
henry
the
eighth
to
have
it
all
his
own
way
penrose
looked
at
his
superior
in
blank
bewilderment
his
superior
withheld
any
further
information
for
the
present
everything
in
its
turn
the
discreet
father
resumed
the
turn
of
explanation
has
not
come
yet
i
have
something
else
to
show
you
first
one
of
the
most
interesting
relics
in
england
look
he
unlocked
a
flat
mahogany
box
and
displayed
to
view
some
writings
on
vellum
evidently
of
great
age
you
have
had
a
little
sermon
already
he
said
you
shall
have
a
little
story
now
no
doubt
you
have
heard
of
newstead
abbey
famous
among
the
readers
of
poetry
as
the
residence
of
byron
king
henry
treated
newstead
exactly
as
he
treated
vange
abbey
many
years
since
the
lake
at
newstead
was
dragged
and
the
brass
eagle
which
had
served
as
the
lectern
in
the
old
church
was
rescued
from
the
waters
in
which
it
had
lain
for
centuries
a
secret
receptacle
was
discovered
in
the
body
of
the
eagle
and
the
ancient
of
the
abbey
were
found
in
it
the
monks
had
taken
that
method
of
concealing
the
legal
proof
of
their
rights
and
privileges
in
the
hope
a
vain
hope
i
need
hardly
say
that
a
time
might
come
when
justice
would
restore
to
them
the
property
of
which
they
had
been
robbed
only
last
summer
one
of
our
bishops
administering
a
northern
diocese
spoke
of
these
circumstances
to
a
devout
catholic
friend
and
said
he
thought
it
possible
that
the
precaution
taken
by
the
monks
at
newstead
might
also
have
been
taken
by
the
monks
at
vange
the
friend
i
should
tell
you
was
an
enthusiast
saying
nothing
to
the
bishop
whose
position
and
responsibilities
he
was
bound
to
respect
he
took
into
his
confidence
persons
whom
he
could
trust
one
night
in
the
absence
of
the
present
proprietor
or
i
should
rather
say
the
present
usurper
of
the
estate
the
lake
at
vange
was
privately
dragged
with
a
result
that
proved
the
bishop
s
conjecture
to
be
right
read
those
valuable
documents
knowing
your
strict
sense
of
honor
my
son
and
your
admirable
tenderness
of
conscience
i
wish
you
to
be
satisfied
of
the
title
of
the
church
to
the
lands
of
vange
by
evidence
which
is
beyond
with
this
little
preface
he
waited
while
penrose
read
the
any
doubt
on
your
mind
he
asked
when
the
reading
had
come
to
an
end
not
the
shadow
of
a
is
the
church
s
right
to
the
property
clear
as
clear
father
as
words
can
make
very
good
we
will
lock
up
the
documents
arbitrary
confiscation
arthur
even
on
the
part
of
a
king
can
not
override
the
law
what
the
church
once
lawfully
possessed
the
church
has
a
right
to
recover
any
doubt
about
that
in
your
mind
only
the
doubt
of
the
church
can
recover
is
there
anything
in
this
particular
case
to
be
hoped
from
the
law
nothing
and
yet
father
you
speak
as
if
you
saw
some
prospect
of
the
restitution
of
the
property
by
what
means
can
the
restitution
be
made
by
peaceful
and
worthy
means
father
benwell
answered
by
honorable
restoration
of
the
confiscated
property
to
the
church
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
is
now
in
possession
of
penrose
was
surprised
and
interested
is
the
person
a
catholic
he
asked
eagerly
not
father
benwell
laid
a
strong
emphasis
on
those
two
little
words
his
fat
fingers
drummed
restlessly
on
the
table
his
vigilant
eyes
rested
expectantly
on
penrose
surely
you
understand
me
arthur
he
added
after
an
interval
the
color
rose
slowly
in
the
worn
face
of
penrose
i
am
afraid
to
understand
you
he
said
why
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
my
better
sense
which
understands
i
am
afraid
father
it
may
be
my
vanity
and
father
benwell
leaned
back
luxuriously
in
his
chair
i
like
that
modesty
he
said
with
a
relishing
smack
of
his
lips
as
if
modesty
was
as
good
as
a
meal
to
him
there
is
power
of
the
right
sort
arthur
hidden
under
the
diffidence
that
does
you
honor
i
am
more
than
ever
satisfied
that
i
have
been
right
in
reporting
you
as
worthy
of
this
most
serious
trust
i
believe
the
conversion
of
the
owner
of
vange
abbey
is
in
your
hands
no
more
than
a
matter
of
may
i
ask
what
his
name
is
certainly
his
name
is
lewis
when
do
you
introduce
me
to
him
impossible
to
say
i
have
not
yet
been
introduced
you
don
t
know
romayne
i
have
never
even
seen
these
discouraging
replies
were
made
with
the
perfect
composure
of
a
man
who
saw
his
way
clearly
before
him
sinking
from
one
depth
of
perplexity
to
another
penrose
ventured
on
putting
one
last
question
how
am
i
to
approach
romayne
he
asked
i
can
only
answer
that
arthur
by
admitting
you
still
further
into
my
confidence
it
is
disagreeable
to
me
said
the
reverend
gentleman
with
the
most
becoming
humility
to
speak
of
myself
but
it
must
be
done
shall
we
have
a
little
coffee
to
help
us
through
the
coming
extract
from
father
benwell
s
autobiography
don
t
look
so
serious
my
son
when
the
occasion
justifies
it
let
us
take
life
he
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
the
coffee
as
if
he
was
the
master
of
the
house
the
servant
treated
him
with
the
most
scrupulous
respect
he
hummed
a
little
tune
and
talked
at
intervals
of
the
weather
while
they
were
waiting
plenty
of
sugar
arthur
he
inquired
when
the
coffee
was
brought
in
no
even
in
trifles
i
should
have
been
glad
to
feel
that
there
was
perfect
sympathy
between
us
i
like
plenty
of
sugar
having
sweetened
his
coffee
with
the
closest
attention
to
the
process
he
was
at
liberty
to
enlighten
his
young
friend
he
did
it
so
easily
and
so
cheerfully
that
a
far
less
patient
man
than
penrose
would
have
listened
to
him
with
interest
chapter
iii
the
introduction
to
romayne
excepting
my
employment
here
in
the
library
father
benwell
began
and
some
interesting
conversation
with
lord
loring
to
which
i
shall
presently
allude
i
am
almost
as
great
a
stranger
in
this
house
arthur
as
yourself
when
the
object
which
we
now
have
in
view
was
first
taken
seriously
into
consideration
i
had
the
honor
of
being
personally
acquainted
with
lord
loring
i
was
also
aware
that
he
was
an
intimate
and
trusted
friend
of
romayne
under
these
circumstances
his
lordship
presented
himself
to
our
point
of
view
as
a
means
of
approaching
the
owner
of
vange
abbey
without
exciting
distrust
i
was
charged
accordingly
with
the
duty
of
establishing
myself
on
terms
of
intimacy
in
this
house
by
way
of
making
room
for
me
the
spiritual
director
of
lord
and
lady
loring
was
removed
to
a
cure
of
souls
in
ireland
and
here
i
am
in
his
place
don
t
treat
me
when
we
are
in
the
presence
of
visitors
with
any
special
marks
of
respect
i
am
not
provincial
of
our
order
in
lord
loring
s
house
i
am
one
of
the
inferior
penrose
looked
at
him
with
admiration
it
is
a
great
sacrifice
to
make
father
in
your
position
and
at
your
not
at
all
arthur
a
position
of
authority
involves
certain
temptations
to
pride
i
feel
this
change
as
a
lesson
in
humility
which
is
good
for
me
for
example
lady
loring
as
i
can
plainly
see
dislikes
and
distrusts
me
then
again
a
young
lady
has
recently
arrived
here
on
a
visit
she
is
a
protestant
with
all
the
prejudices
incident
to
that
way
of
thinking
avoids
me
so
carefully
poor
soul
that
i
have
never
seen
her
yet
these
rebuffs
are
wholesome
reminders
of
his
fallible
human
nature
to
a
man
who
has
occupied
a
place
of
high
trust
and
command
besides
there
have
been
obstacles
in
my
way
which
have
had
an
excellent
effect
in
rousing
my
energies
how
do
you
feel
arthur
when
you
encounter
obstacles
i
do
my
best
to
remove
them
father
but
i
am
sometimes
conscious
of
a
sense
of
curious
said
father
benwell
i
am
only
conscious
myself
of
a
sense
of
impatience
what
right
has
an
obstacle
to
get
in
way
that
is
how
i
look
at
it
for
example
the
first
thing
i
heard
when
i
came
here
was
that
romayne
had
left
england
my
introduction
to
him
was
indefinitely
delayed
i
had
to
look
to
lord
loring
for
all
the
information
i
wanted
relating
to
the
man
and
his
habits
there
was
another
obstacle
not
living
in
the
house
i
was
obliged
to
find
an
excuse
for
being
constantly
on
the
spot
ready
to
take
advantage
of
his
lordship
s
leisure
moments
for
conversation
i
sat
down
in
this
room
and
i
said
to
myself
before
i
get
up
again
i
mean
to
brush
these
impertinent
obstacles
out
of
my
way
the
state
of
the
books
suggested
the
idea
of
which
i
was
in
search
before
i
left
the
house
i
was
charged
with
the
rearrangement
of
the
library
from
that
moment
i
came
and
went
as
often
as
i
liked
whenever
lord
loring
was
disposed
for
a
little
talk
there
i
was
to
lead
the
talk
in
the
right
direction
and
what
is
the
result
on
the
first
occasion
when
romayne
presents
himself
i
can
place
you
in
a
position
to
become
his
daily
companion
all
due
arthur
in
the
first
instance
to
my
impatience
of
obstacles
amusing
isn
t
it
penrose
was
perhaps
deficient
in
the
sense
of
humor
instead
of
being
amused
he
appeared
to
be
anxious
for
more
information
in
what
capacity
am
i
to
be
romayne
s
companion
he
asked
father
benwell
poured
himself
out
another
cup
of
coffee
suppose
i
tell
you
first
he
suggested
how
circumstances
present
romayne
to
us
as
a
promising
subject
for
conversion
he
is
young
still
a
single
man
not
compromised
by
any
illicit
connection
romantic
sensitive
highly
cultivated
no
near
relations
are
alive
to
influence
him
and
to
my
certain
knowledge
his
estate
is
not
entailed
he
has
devoted
himself
for
years
past
to
books
and
is
collecting
materials
for
a
work
of
immense
research
on
the
origin
of
religions
some
great
sorrow
or
remorse
lord
loring
did
not
mention
what
it
was
has
told
seriously
on
his
nervous
system
already
injured
by
night
study
add
to
this
that
he
is
now
within
our
reach
he
has
lately
returned
to
london
and
is
living
quite
alone
at
a
private
hotel
for
some
reason
which
i
am
not
acquainted
with
he
keeps
away
from
vange
abbey
the
very
place
as
i
should
have
thought
for
a
studious
penrose
began
to
be
interested
have
you
been
to
the
abbey
he
said
i
made
a
little
excursion
to
that
part
of
yorkshire
arthur
not
long
since
a
very
pleasant
trip
apart
from
the
painful
associations
connected
with
the
ruin
and
profanation
of
a
sacred
place
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
revenues
i
know
the
value
of
that
productive
part
of
the
estate
which
stretches
southward
away
from
the
barren
region
round
the
house
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
romayne
and
to
your
position
as
his
future
companion
he
has
had
his
books
sent
to
him
from
vange
and
has
persuaded
himself
that
continued
study
is
the
one
remedy
for
his
troubles
whatever
they
may
be
at
lord
loring
s
suggestion
a
consultation
of
physicians
was
held
on
his
case
the
other
is
he
so
ill
as
that
penrose
exclaimed
so
it
appears
father
benwell
replied
lord
loring
is
mysteriously
silent
about
the
illness
one
result
of
the
consultation
i
extracted
from
him
in
which
you
are
interested
the
doctors
protested
against
his
employing
himself
on
his
proposed
work
he
was
too
obstinate
to
listen
to
them
there
was
but
one
concession
that
they
could
gain
from
him
he
consented
to
spare
himself
in
some
small
degree
by
employing
an
amanuensis
it
was
left
to
lord
loring
to
find
the
man
i
was
consulted
by
his
lordship
i
was
even
invited
to
undertake
the
duty
myself
each
one
in
his
proper
sphere
my
son
the
person
who
converts
romayne
must
be
young
enough
and
pliable
enough
to
be
his
friend
and
companion
your
part
is
there
arthur
you
are
the
future
amanuensis
how
does
the
prospect
strike
you
now
i
beg
your
pardon
father
i
fear
i
am
unworthy
of
the
confidence
which
is
placed
in
in
what
way
penrose
answered
with
unfeigned
humility
i
am
afraid
i
may
fail
to
justify
your
belief
in
me
he
said
unless
i
can
really
feel
that
i
am
converting
romayne
for
his
own
soul
s
sake
however
righteous
the
cause
may
be
i
can
not
find
in
the
restitution
of
the
church
property
a
sufficient
motive
for
persuading
him
to
change
his
religious
faith
there
is
something
so
serious
in
the
responsibility
which
you
lay
on
me
that
i
shall
sink
under
the
burden
unless
my
whole
heart
is
in
the
work
if
i
feel
attracted
toward
romayne
when
i
first
see
him
if
he
wins
upon
me
little
by
little
until
i
love
him
like
a
brother
then
indeed
i
can
promise
that
his
conversion
shall
be
the
dearest
object
of
my
life
but
if
there
is
not
this
intimate
sympathy
between
us
forgive
me
if
i
say
it
plainly
i
implore
you
to
pass
me
over
and
to
commit
the
task
to
the
hands
of
another
his
voice
trembled
his
eyes
moistened
father
benwell
handled
his
young
friend
s
rising
emotion
with
the
dexterity
of
a
skilled
angler
humoring
the
struggles
of
a
lively
fish
good
arthur
he
said
i
see
much
too
much
dear
boy
of
people
it
is
as
refreshing
to
me
to
hear
you
as
a
draught
of
water
to
a
thirsty
man
at
the
same
time
let
me
suggest
that
you
are
innocently
raising
difficulties
where
no
difficulties
exist
i
have
already
mentioned
as
one
of
the
necessities
of
the
case
that
you
and
romayne
should
be
friends
how
can
that
be
unless
there
is
precisely
that
sympathy
between
you
which
you
have
so
well
described
i
am
a
sanguine
man
and
i
believe
you
will
like
each
other
wait
till
you
see
as
the
words
passed
his
lips
the
door
that
led
to
the
picture
gallery
was
opened
lord
loring
entered
the
library
he
looked
quickly
round
him
apparently
in
search
of
some
person
who
might
perhaps
be
found
in
the
room
a
shade
of
annoyance
showed
itself
in
his
face
and
disappeared
again
as
he
bowed
to
the
two
jesuits
don
t
let
me
disturb
you
he
said
looking
at
penrose
is
this
the
gentleman
who
is
to
assist
romayne
father
benwell
presented
his
young
friend
arthur
penrose
my
lord
i
ventured
to
suggest
that
he
should
call
here
in
case
you
wished
to
put
any
questions
to
quite
needless
after
your
recommendation
lord
loring
answered
graciously
mr
penrose
could
not
have
come
here
at
a
more
appropriate
time
as
it
happens
romayne
has
paid
us
a
visit
today
he
is
now
in
the
picture
the
priests
looked
at
each
other
lord
loring
left
them
as
he
spoke
he
walked
to
the
opposite
door
of
the
library
opened
it
glanced
round
the
hall
and
at
the
stairs
and
returned
again
with
the
passing
expression
of
annoyance
visible
once
more
come
with
me
to
the
gallery
gentlemen
he
said
i
shall
be
happy
to
introduce
you
to
penrose
accepted
the
proposal
father
benwell
pointed
with
a
smile
to
the
books
scattered
about
him
with
permission
i
will
follow
your
lordship
he
said
who
was
my
lord
looking
for
that
was
the
question
in
father
benwell
s
mind
while
he
put
some
of
the
books
away
on
the
shelves
and
collected
the
scattered
papers
on
the
table
relating
to
his
correspondence
with
rome
it
had
become
a
habit
of
his
life
to
be
suspicious
of
any
circumstances
occurring
within
his
range
of
observation
for
which
he
was
unable
to
account
he
might
have
felt
some
stronger
emotion
on
this
occasion
if
he
had
known
that
the
conspiracy
in
the
library
to
convert
romayne
was
matched
by
the
conspiracy
in
the
picture
gallery
to
marry
him
lady
loring
s
narrative
of
the
conversation
which
had
taken
place
between
stella
and
herself
had
encouraged
her
husband
to
try
his
proposed
experiment
without
delay
i
shall
send
a
letter
at
once
to
romayne
s
hotel
he
said
inviting
him
to
come
here
her
ladyship
inquired
yes
i
shall
say
i
particularly
wish
to
consult
him
about
a
picture
are
we
to
prepare
stella
to
see
him
or
would
it
be
better
to
let
the
meeting
take
her
by
surprise
certainly
not
said
lady
loring
with
her
sensitive
disposition
i
am
afraid
of
taking
stella
by
surprise
let
me
only
tell
her
that
romayne
is
the
original
of
her
portrait
and
that
he
is
likely
to
call
on
you
to
see
the
picture
and
leave
the
rest
to
lady
loring
s
suggestion
was
immediately
carried
out
in
the
first
fervor
of
her
agitation
stella
had
declared
that
her
courage
was
not
equal
to
a
meeting
with
romayne
on
that
day
becoming
more
composed
she
yielded
to
lady
loring
s
persuasion
so
far
as
to
promise
that
she
would
at
least
make
the
attempt
to
follow
her
friend
to
the
gallery
if
i
go
down
with
you
she
said
it
will
look
as
if
we
had
arranged
the
thing
between
us
i
can
t
bear
even
to
think
of
that
let
me
look
in
by
myself
as
if
it
was
by
consenting
to
this
arrangement
lady
loring
had
proceeded
alone
to
the
gallery
when
romayne
s
visit
was
announced
the
minutes
passed
and
stella
did
not
appear
it
was
quite
possible
that
she
might
shrink
from
openly
presenting
herself
at
the
main
entrance
to
the
gallery
and
might
prefer
especially
if
she
was
not
aware
of
the
priest
s
presence
in
the
room
to
slip
in
quietly
by
the
library
door
failing
to
find
her
on
putting
this
idea
to
the
test
lord
loring
had
discovered
penrose
and
had
so
hastened
the
introduction
of
the
younger
of
the
two
jesuits
to
romayne
having
gathered
his
papers
together
father
benwell
crossed
the
library
to
the
deep
which
lighted
the
room
and
opened
his
standing
on
a
small
table
in
the
recess
placed
in
this
position
he
was
invisible
to
any
person
entering
the
room
by
the
hall
door
he
had
secured
his
papers
in
the
and
had
just
closed
and
locked
it
when
he
heard
the
door
cautiously
opened
the
instant
afterward
the
rustling
of
a
woman
s
dress
over
the
carpet
caught
his
ear
other
men
might
have
walked
out
of
the
recess
and
shown
themselves
father
benwell
stayed
where
he
was
and
waited
until
the
lady
crossed
his
range
of
view
the
priest
observed
with
cold
attention
her
eyes
and
hair
her
color
her
modest
grace
of
movement
slowly
and
in
evident
agitation
she
advanced
to
the
door
of
the
picture
gallery
and
paused
as
if
she
was
afraid
to
open
it
father
benwell
heard
her
sigh
to
herself
softly
oh
how
shall
i
meet
him
she
turned
aside
to
the
over
the
the
reflection
of
her
charming
face
seemed
to
rouse
her
courage
she
retraced
her
steps
and
timidly
opened
the
door
lord
loring
must
have
been
close
by
at
the
moment
his
voice
immediately
made
itself
heard
in
the
library
come
in
stella
come
in
here
is
a
new
picture
for
you
to
see
and
a
friend
whom
i
want
to
present
to
you
who
must
be
your
friend
too
lewis
the
door
was
closed
again
father
benwell
stood
still
as
a
statue
in
the
recess
with
his
head
down
deep
in
thought
after
a
while
he
roused
himself
and
rapidly
returned
to
the
writing
table
with
a
roughness
strangely
unlike
his
customary
deliberation
of
movement
he
snatched
a
sheet
of
paper
out
of
the
case
and
frowning
heavily
wrote
these
lines
on
it
since
my
letter
was
sealed
i
have
made
a
discovery
which
must
be
communicated
without
the
loss
of
a
post
i
greatly
fear
there
may
be
a
woman
in
our
way
trust
me
to
combat
this
obstacle
as
i
have
combated
other
obstacles
in
the
meantime
the
work
goes
on
penrose
has
received
his
first
instructions
and
has
been
presented
to
he
addressed
this
letter
to
rome
as
he
had
addressed
the
letter
preceding
it
now
for
the
woman
he
said
to
himself
and
opened
the
door
of
the
picture
gallery
chapter

father
benwell
hits
art
has
its
trials
as
well
as
its
triumphs
it
is
powerless
to
assert
itself
against
the
sordid
interests
of
everyday
life
the
greatest
book
ever
written
the
finest
picture
ever
painted
appeals
in
vain
to
minds
preoccupied
by
selfish
and
secret
cares
on
entering
lord
loring
s
gallery
father
benwell
found
but
one
person
who
was
not
looking
at
the
pictures
under
false
pretenses
innocent
of
all
suspicion
of
the
conflicting
interests
whose
struggle
now
centered
in
himself
romayne
was
carefully
studying
the
picture
which
had
been
made
the
pretext
for
inviting
him
to
the
house
he
had
bowed
to
stella
with
a
tranquil
admiration
of
her
beauty
he
had
shaken
hands
with
penrose
and
had
said
some
kind
words
to
his
future
secretary
and
then
he
had
turned
to
the
picture
as
if
stella
and
penrose
had
ceased
from
that
moment
to
occupy
his
mind
in
your
place
he
said
quietly
to
lord
loring
i
should
not
buy
this
why
not
it
seems
to
me
to
have
the
serious
defect
of
the
modern
english
school
of
painting
a
total
want
of
thought
in
the
rendering
of
the
subject
disguised
under
dexterous
technical
tricks
of
the
brush
when
you
have
seen
one
of
that
man
s
pictures
you
have
seen
all
he
manufactures
he
doesn
t
father
benwell
came
in
while
romayne
was
speaking
he
went
through
the
ceremonies
of
introduction
to
the
master
of
vange
abbey
with
perfect
politeness
but
a
little
absently
his
mind
was
bent
on
putting
his
suspicion
of
stella
to
the
test
of
confirmation
not
waiting
to
be
presented
he
turned
to
her
with
the
air
of
fatherly
interest
and
chastened
admiration
which
he
well
knew
how
to
assume
in
his
intercourse
with
women
may
i
ask
if
you
agree
with
romayne
s
estimate
of
the
picture
he
said
in
his
gentlest
tones
she
had
heard
of
him
and
of
his
position
in
the
house
it
was
quite
needless
for
lady
loring
to
whisper
to
her
father
benwell
my
dear
her
antipathy
identified
him
as
readily
as
her
sympathy
might
have
identified
a
man
who
had
produced
a
favorable
impression
on
her
i
have
no
pretension
to
be
a
critic
she
answered
with
frigid
politeness
i
only
know
what
i
personally
like
or
the
reply
exactly
answered
father
benwell
s
purpose
it
diverted
romayne
s
attention
from
the
picture
to
stella
the
priest
had
secured
his
opportunity
of
reading
their
faces
while
they
were
looking
at
each
other
i
think
you
have
just
stated
the
true
motive
for
all
criticism
romayne
said
to
stella
whether
we
only
express
our
opinions
of
pictures
or
books
in
the
course
of
conversation
or
whether
we
assert
them
at
full
length
with
all
the
authority
of
print
we
are
really
speaking
in
either
case
of
what
personally
pleases
or
repels
us
my
poor
opinion
of
that
picture
means
that
it
says
nothing
to
me
does
it
say
anything
to
you
he
smiled
gently
as
he
put
the
question
to
her
but
there
was
no
betrayal
of
emotion
in
his
eyes
or
in
his
voice
relieved
of
anxiety
so
far
as
romayne
was
concerned
father
benwell
looked
at
stella
steadily
as
she
controlled
herself
the
confession
of
her
heart
s
secret
found
its
way
into
her
face
the
coldly
composed
expression
which
had
confronted
the
priest
when
she
spoke
to
him
melted
away
softly
under
the
influence
of
romayne
s
voice
and
romayne
s
look
without
any
positive
change
of
color
her
delicate
skin
glowed
faintly
as
if
it
felt
some
animating
inner
warmth
her
eyes
and
lips
brightened
with
a
new
vitality
her
frail
elegant
figure
seemed
insensibly
to
strengthen
and
expand
like
the
leaf
of
a
flower
under
a
favoring
sunny
air
when
she
answered
romayne
agreeing
with
him
it
is
needless
to
say
there
was
a
tender
persuasiveness
in
her
tones
shyly
inviting
him
still
to
speak
to
her
and
still
to
look
at
her
which
would
in
itself
have
told
father
benwell
the
truth
even
if
he
had
not
been
in
a
position
to
see
her
face
confirmed
in
his
doubts
of
her
he
looked
with
concealed
suspicion
at
lady
loring
next
sympathy
with
stella
was
undisguisedly
expressed
to
him
in
the
honest
blue
eyes
of
stella
s
faithful
friend
the
discussion
on
the
subject
of
the
unfortunate
picture
was
resumed
by
lord
loring
who
thought
the
opinions
of
romayne
and
stella
needlessly
severe
lady
loring
as
usual
agreed
with
her
husband
while
the
general
attention
was
occupied
in
this
way
father
benwell
said
a
word
to
penrose
thus
far
a
silent
listener
to
the
discourse
on
art
have
you
seen
the
famous
portrait
of
the
first
lady
loring
by
gainsborough
he
asked
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
took
penrose
by
the
arm
and
led
him
away
to
the
picture
which
had
the
additional
merit
under
present
circumstances
of
hanging
at
the
other
end
of
the
gallery
how
do
you
like
romayne
father
benwell
put
the
question
in
low
peremptory
tones
evidently
impatient
for
a
reply
he
interests
me
already
said
penrose
he
looks
so
ill
and
so
sad
and
he
spoke
to
me
so
kindly
in
short
father
benwell
interposed
romayne
has
produced
a
favorable
impression
on
you
let
us
get
on
to
the
next
thing
you
must
produce
a
favorable
impression
on
penrose
sighed
with
the
best
will
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
people
whom
i
like
he
said
i
don
t
always
succeed
they
used
to
tell
me
at
oxford
that
i
was
shy
and
i
am
afraid
that
is
against
me
i
wish
i
possessed
some
of
your
social
advantages
father
leave
it
to
me
son
are
they
still
talking
about
the
picture
i
have
something
more
to
say
to
you
have
you
noticed
the
young
lady
i
thought
her
beautiful
but
she
looks
a
little
father
benwell
smiled
when
you
are
as
old
as
i
am
he
said
you
will
not
believe
in
appearances
where
women
are
concerned
do
you
know
what
i
think
of
her
beautiful
if
you
like
and
dangerous
as
dangerous
in
what
way
this
is
for
your
private
ear
arthur
she
is
in
love
with
romayne
wait
a
minute
and
lady
loring
unless
i
am
entirely
mistaken
in
what
i
observed
knows
it
and
favors
it
the
beautiful
stella
may
be
the
destruction
of
all
our
hopes
unless
we
keep
romayne
out
of
her
these
words
were
whispered
with
an
earnestness
and
agitation
which
surprised
penrose
his
superior
s
equanimity
was
not
easily
overthrown
are
you
sure
father
of
what
you
say
he
asked
i
am
quite
sure
or
i
should
not
have
do
you
think
romayne
returns
the
feeling
not
yet
luckily
you
must
use
your
first
friendly
influence
over
him
what
is
her
name
her
surname
i
eyrecourt
miss
stella
very
well
you
must
use
your
influence
when
you
are
quite
sure
that
it
an
influence
to
keep
romayne
away
from
miss
penrose
looked
embarrassed
i
am
afraid
i
should
hardly
know
how
to
do
that
he
said
but
i
should
naturally
as
his
assistant
encourage
him
to
keep
to
his
whatever
arthur
s
superior
might
privately
think
of
arthur
s
reply
he
received
it
with
outward
indulgence
that
will
come
to
the
same
thing
he
said
besides
when
i
get
the
information
i
want
this
is
strictly
between
ourselves
i
may
be
of
some
use
in
placing
obstacles
in
the
lady
s
penrose
started
information
he
repeated
what
information
tell
me
something
before
i
answer
you
said
father
benwell
how
old
do
you
take
miss
eyrecourt
to
be
i
am
not
a
good
judge
in
such
matters
between
twenty
and
perhaps
we
will
take
her
age
at
that
estimate
arthur
in
former
years
i
have
had
opportunities
of
studying
women
s
characters
in
the
confessional
can
you
guess
what
my
experience
tells
me
of
miss
eyrecourt
no
indeed
a
lady
is
not
in
love
for
the
first
time
when
she
is
between
twenty
and
years
old
that
is
my
experience
said
father
benwell
if
i
can
find
a
person
capable
of
informing
me
i
may
make
some
valuable
discoveries
in
the
earlier
history
of
miss
eyrecourt
s
life
no
more
now
we
had
better
return
to
our
chapter
father
benwell
misses
the
group
before
the
picture
which
had
been
the
subject
of
dispute
was
broken
up
in
one
part
of
the
gallery
lady
loring
and
stella
were
whispering
together
on
a
sofa
in
another
part
lord
loring
was
speaking
privately
to
romayne
do
you
think
you
will
like
penrose
his
lordship
asked
yes
so
far
as
i
can
tell
at
present
he
seems
to
be
modest
and
you
are
looking
ill
my
dear
romayne
have
you
again
heard
the
voice
that
haunts
you
romayne
answered
with
evident
reluctance
i
don
t
know
why
he
said
but
the
dread
of
hearing
it
again
has
oppressed
me
all
this
morning
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
came
here
in
the
hope
that
the
change
might
relieve
has
it
done
so
yes
thus
doesn
t
that
suggest
my
friend
that
a
greater
change
might
be
of
use
to
you
don
t
ask
me
about
it
loring
i
can
go
through
my
ordeal
but
i
hate
speaking
of
let
us
speak
of
something
else
then
said
lord
loring
what
do
you
think
of
miss
eyrecourt
a
very
striking
face
full
of
expression
and
character
leonardo
would
have
painted
a
noble
portrait
of
her
but
there
is
something
in
her
manner
he
stopped
unwilling
or
unable
to
finish
the
sentence
something
you
don
t
like
lord
loring
suggested
no
something
i
don
t
quite
understand
one
doesn
t
expect
to
find
any
embarrassment
in
the
manner
of
a
woman
and
yet
she
seemed
to
be
embarrassed
when
she
spoke
to
me
perhaps
i
produced
an
unfortunate
impression
on
lord
loring
laughed
in
any
man
but
you
romayne
i
should
call
that
why
romayne
asked
sharply
lord
loring
looked
unfeignedly
surprised
my
dear
fellow
do
you
really
think
you
are
the
sort
of
man
who
impresses
a
woman
unfavorably
at
first
sight
for
once
in
your
life
indulge
in
the
amiable
weakness
of
doing
yourself
justice
and
find
a
better
reason
for
miss
eyrecourt
s
for
the
first
time
since
he
and
his
friend
had
been
talking
together
romayne
turned
toward
stella
he
innocently
caught
her
in
the
act
of
looking
at
him
a
younger
woman
or
a
woman
of
weaker
character
would
have
looked
away
again
stella
s
noble
head
drooped
her
eyes
sank
slowly
until
they
rested
on
her
long
white
hands
crossed
upon
her
lap
for
a
moment
more
romayne
looked
at
her
with
steady
attention
he
roused
himself
and
spoke
to
lord
loring
in
lowered
tones
have
you
known
miss
eyrecourt
for
a
long
time
she
is
my
wife
s
oldest
and
dearest
friend
i
think
romayne
you
would
feel
interested
in
stella
if
you
saw
more
of
romayne
bowed
in
silent
submission
to
lord
loring
s
prophetic
remark
let
us
look
at
the
pictures
he
said
quietly
as
he
moved
down
the
gallery
the
two
priests
met
him
father
benwell
saw
his
opportunity
of
helping
penrose
to
produce
a
favorable
impression
forgive
the
curiosity
of
an
old
student
romayne
he
said
in
his
pleasant
cheerful
way
lord
loring
tells
me
you
have
sent
to
the
country
for
your
books
do
you
find
a
london
hotel
favorable
to
study
it
is
a
very
quiet
hotel
romayne
answered
and
the
people
know
my
he
turned
to
arthur
i
have
my
own
set
of
rooms
penrose
he
continued
with
a
room
at
your
disposal
i
used
to
enjoy
the
solitude
of
my
house
in
the
country
my
tastes
have
lately
changed
there
are
times
now
when
i
want
to
see
the
life
in
the
streets
as
a
relief
though
we
are
in
a
hotel
i
can
promise
that
you
will
not
be
troubled
by
interruptions
when
you
kindly
lend
me
the
use
of
your
father
benwell
answered
before
penrose
could
speak
you
may
perhaps
find
my
young
friend
s
memory
of
some
use
to
you
romayne
as
well
as
his
pen
penrose
has
studied
in
the
vatican
library
if
your
reading
leads
you
that
way
he
knows
more
than
most
men
of
the
rare
old
manuscripts
which
treat
of
the
early
history
of
this
delicately
managed
reference
to
the
projected
work
on
the
origin
of
religions
produced
its
effect
i
should
like
very
much
penrose
to
speak
to
you
about
those
manuscripts
romayne
said
copies
of
some
of
them
may
perhaps
be
in
the
british
museum
is
it
asking
too
much
to
inquire
if
you
are
disengaged
this
morning
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
if
you
will
kindly
call
at
my
hotel
in
an
hour
s
time
i
shall
have
looked
over
my
notes
and
shall
be
ready
for
you
with
a
list
of
titles
and
dates
there
is
the
with
those
words
he
advanced
to
take
his
leave
of
lady
loring
and
stella
father
benwell
was
a
man
possessed
of
extraordinary
power
of
foresight
but
he
was
not
infallible
seeing
that
romayne
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
house
and
feeling
that
he
had
paved
the
way
successfully
for
romayne
s
amanuensis
he
too
readily
assumed
that
there
was
nothing
further
to
be
gained
by
remaining
in
the
gallery
moreover
the
interval
before
penrose
called
at
the
hotel
might
be
usefully
filled
up
by
some
wise
words
of
advice
relating
to
the
religious
uses
to
which
he
might
turn
his
intercourse
with
his
employer
making
one
of
his
ready
and
plausible
excuses
he
accordingly
returned
with
penrose
to
the
library
and
so
committed
as
he
himself
discovered
at
a
later
time
one
of
the
few
mistakes
in
the
long
record
of
his
life
in
the
meanwhile
romayne
was
not
permitted
to
bring
his
visit
to
a
conclusion
without
hospitable
remonstrance
on
the
part
of
lady
loring
she
felt
for
stella
with
a
woman
s
enthusiastic
devotion
to
the
interests
of
true
love
and
she
had
firmly
resolved
that
a
matter
so
trifling
as
the
cultivation
of
romayne
s
mind
should
not
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
way
of
the
far
more
important
enterprise
of
opening
his
heart
to
the
influence
of
the
sex
stay
and
lunch
with
us
she
said
when
he
held
out
his
hand
to
bid
her
thank
you
lady
loring
i
never
take
well
then
come
and
dine
with
us
no
party
only
ourselves
tomorrow
and
next
day
we
are
disengaged
which
day
shall
it
be
romayne
still
resisted
you
are
very
kind
in
my
state
of
health
i
am
unwilling
to
make
engagements
which
i
may
not
be
able
to
lady
loring
was
just
as
resolute
on
her
side
she
appealed
to
stella
mr
romayne
persists
my
dear
in
putting
me
off
with
excuses
try
if
you
can
persuade
am
not
likely
to
have
any
influence
the
tone
in
which
she
replied
struck
romayne
he
looked
at
her
her
eyes
gravely
meeting
his
eyes
held
him
with
a
strange
fascination
she
was
not
herself
conscious
how
openly
all
that
was
noble
and
true
in
her
nature
all
that
was
most
deeply
and
sensitively
felt
in
her
aspirations
spoke
at
that
moment
in
her
look
romayne
s
face
changed
he
turned
pale
under
the
new
emotion
that
she
had
roused
in
him
lady
loring
observed
him
attentively
perhaps
you
underrate
your
influence
stella
she
suggested
stella
remained
impenetrable
to
persuasion
i
have
only
been
introduced
to
romayne
half
an
hour
since
she
said
i
am
not
vain
enough
to
suppose
that
i
can
produce
a
favorable
impression
on
any
one
in
so
short
a
she
had
expressed
in
other
words
romayne
s
own
idea
of
himself
in
speaking
of
her
to
lord
loring
he
was
struck
by
the
coincidence
perhaps
we
have
begun
miss
eyrecourt
by
misinterpreting
one
another
he
said
we
may
arrive
at
a
better
understanding
when
i
have
the
honor
of
meeting
you
he
hesitated
and
looked
at
lady
loring
she
was
not
the
woman
to
let
a
fair
opportunity
escape
her
we
will
say
evening
she
resumed
at
seven
o
said
romayne
he
shook
hands
with
stella
and
left
the
picture
gallery
thus
far
the
conspiracy
to
marry
him
promised
even
more
hopefully
than
the
conspiracy
to
convert
him
and
father
benwell
carefully
instructing
penrose
in
the
next
room
was
not
aware
of
it
but
the
hours
in
their
progress
mark
the
march
of
events
as
surely
as
they
mark
the
march
of
time
the
day
passed
the
evening
came
and
with
its
coming
the
prospects
of
the
conversion
brightened
in
their
turn
let
father
benwell
himself
relate
how
it
happened
in
an
extract
from
his
report
to
rome
written
the
same
evening
i
had
arranged
with
penrose
that
he
should
call
at
my
lodgings
and
tell
me
how
he
had
prospered
at
the
first
performance
of
his
duties
as
secretary
to
romayne
the
moment
he
entered
the
room
the
signs
of
disturbance
in
his
face
told
me
that
something
serious
had
happened
i
asked
directly
if
there
had
been
any
disagreement
between
romayne
and
himself
he
repeated
the
word
with
every
appearance
of
surprise
disagreement
he
said
no
words
can
tell
how
sincerely
i
feel
for
romayne
i
can
not
express
to
you
father
how
eager
i
am
to
be
of
service
to
him
relieved
so
far
i
naturally
asked
what
had
happened
penrose
betrayed
a
marked
embarrassment
in
answering
my
question
i
have
innocently
surprised
a
secret
he
said
on
which
i
had
no
right
to
intrude
all
that
i
can
honorably
tell
you
shall
be
told
add
one
more
to
your
many
kindnesses
don
t
command
me
to
speak
when
it
is
my
duty
toward
a
man
to
be
silent
even
to
it
is
needless
to
say
that
i
abstained
from
directly
answering
this
strange
appeal
let
me
hear
what
you
can
tell
i
replied
and
then
we
shall
upon
this
he
spoke
i
need
hardly
recall
to
your
memory
how
careful
we
were
in
first
planning
the
attempt
to
recover
the
vange
property
to
assure
ourselves
of
the
promise
of
success
which
the
peculiar
character
of
the
present
owner
held
out
to
us
in
reporting
what
penrose
said
i
communicate
a
discovery
which
i
venture
to
think
will
be
as
welcome
to
you
as
it
was
to
me
he
began
by
reminding
me
of
what
i
had
myself
told
him
in
speaking
of
romayne
you
mentioned
having
heard
from
lord
loring
of
a
great
sorrow
or
remorse
from
which
he
was
suffering
penrose
said
i
know
what
he
suffers
and
why
he
suffers
and
with
what
noble
resignation
he
submits
to
his
affliction
we
were
sitting
together
at
the
table
looking
over
his
notes
and
memoranda
when
he
suddenly
dropped
the
manuscript
from
which
he
was
reading
to
me
a
ghastly
paleness
overspread
his
face
he
started
up
and
put
both
his
hands
to
his
ears
as
if
he
heard
something
dreadful
and
was
trying
to
deafen
himself
to
it
i
ran
to
the
door
to
call
for
help
he
stopped
me
he
spoke
in
faint
gasping
tones
forbidding
me
to
call
any
one
in
to
witness
what
he
suffered
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
said
it
would
soon
be
over
if
i
had
not
courage
to
remain
with
him
i
could
go
and
return
when
he
was
himself
again
i
so
pitied
him
that
i
found
the
courage
to
remain
when
it
was
over
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
thanked
me
i
had
stayed
by
him
like
a
friend
he
said
and
like
a
friend
he
would
treat
me
sooner
or
later
those
were
his
exact
words
i
must
be
taken
into
his
confidence
and
it
should
be
now
he
told
me
his
melancholy
story
i
implore
you
father
don
t
ask
me
to
repeat
it
be
content
if
i
tell
you
the
effect
of
it
on
myself
the
one
hope
the
one
consolation
for
him
is
in
our
holy
religion
with
all
my
heart
i
devote
myself
to
his
conversion
and
in
my
inmost
soul
i
feel
the
conviction
that
i
shall
succeed
to
this
effect
and
in
this
tone
penrose
spoke
i
abstained
from
pressing
him
to
reveal
romayne
s
confession
the
confession
is
of
no
consequence
to
us
you
know
how
the
moral
force
of
arthur
s
earnestness
and
enthusiasm
fortifies
his
otherwise
weak
character
i
too
believe
he
will
succeed
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
another
subject
you
are
already
informed
that
there
is
a
woman
in
our
way
i
have
my
own
idea
of
the
right
method
of
dealing
with
this
obstacle
when
it
shows
itself
more
plainly
for
the
present
i
need
only
assure
you
that
neither
this
woman
nor
any
woman
shall
succeed
in
her
designs
on
romayne
if
i
can
prevent
having
completed
his
report
in
these
terms
father
benwell
reverted
to
the
consideration
of
his
proposed
inquiries
into
the
past
history
of
stella
s
life
reflection
convinced
him
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
attempt
no
matter
how
guardedly
to
obtain
the
necessary
information
from
lord
loring
or
his
wife
if
he
assumed
at
his
age
to
take
a
strong
interest
in
a
protestant
young
lady
who
had
notoriously
avoided
him
they
would
certainly
feel
surprise
and
surprise
might
in
due
course
of
development
turn
to
suspicion
there
was
but
one
other
person
under
lord
loring
s
roof
to
whom
he
could
address
himself
and
that
person
was
the
housekeeper
as
an
old
servant
possessing
lady
loring
s
confidence
she
might
prove
a
source
of
information
on
the
subject
of
lady
loring
s
fair
friend
and
as
a
good
catholic
she
would
feel
flattered
by
the
notice
of
the
spiritual
director
of
the
household
it
may
not
be
amiss
thought
father
benwell
if
i
try
the
chapter
vi
the
order
of
the
dishes
when
miss
notman
assumed
the
post
of
housekeeper
in
lady
loring
s
service
she
was
accurately
described
as
a
competent
and
respectable
person
and
was
praised
with
perfect
truth
for
her
incorruptible
devotion
to
the
interests
of
her
employers
on
its
weaker
side
her
character
was
represented
by
the
wearing
of
a
youthful
wig
and
the
erroneous
conviction
that
she
still
possessed
a
fine
figure
the
ruling
idea
in
her
narrow
little
mind
was
the
idea
of
her
own
dignity
any
offense
offered
in
this
direction
oppressed
her
memory
for
days
together
and
found
its
way
outward
in
speech
to
any
human
being
whose
attention
she
could
secure
at
five
o
clock
on
the
day
which
followed
his
introduction
to
romayne
father
benwell
sat
drinking
his
coffee
in
the
housekeeper
s
room
to
all
appearance
as
much
at
his
ease
as
if
he
had
known
miss
notman
from
the
remote
days
of
her
childhood
a
new
contribution
to
the
housekeeper
s
little
library
of
devotional
works
lay
on
the
table
and
bore
silent
witness
to
the
means
by
which
he
had
made
those
first
advances
which
had
won
him
his
present
position
miss
notman
s
sense
of
dignity
was
doubly
flattered
she
had
a
priest
for
her
guest
and
a
new
book
with
the
reverend
gentleman
s
autograph
inscribed
on
the
is
your
coffee
to
your
liking
father
a
little
more
sugar
if
you
miss
notman
was
proud
of
her
hand
viewed
as
one
of
the
meritorious
details
of
her
figure
she
took
up
the
with
suavity
and
grace
she
dropped
the
sugar
into
the
cup
with
a
youthful
pleasure
in
ministering
to
the
minor
desires
of
her
illustrious
guest
it
is
so
good
of
you
father
to
honor
me
in
this
way
she
said
with
the
appearance
of
sixteen
upon
the
reality
of
sixty
father
benwell
was
an
adept
at
moral
disguises
of
all
kinds
on
this
occasion
he
wore
the
disguise
of
pastoral
simplicity
i
am
an
idle
old
man
at
this
hour
of
the
afternoon
he
said
i
hope
i
am
not
keeping
you
from
any
household
duties
i
generally
enjoy
my
duties
miss
notman
answered
they
have
not
been
so
agreeable
as
usual
it
is
a
relief
to
me
to
have
done
with
them
even
my
humble
position
has
its
persons
acquainted
with
miss
notman
s
character
hearing
these
last
words
would
have
at
once
changed
the
subject
when
she
spoke
of
her
humble
position
she
invariably
referred
to
some
offense
offered
to
her
dignity
and
she
was
invariably
ready
to
state
the
grievance
at
full
length
ignorant
of
this
peculiarity
father
benwell
committed
a
fatal
error
he
inquired
with
courteous
interest
what
the
housekeeper
s
trials
might
be
oh
sir
they
are
beneath
your
notice
said
miss
notman
modestly
at
the
same
time
i
should
feel
it
an
honor
to
have
the
benefit
of
your
opinion
i
should
so
like
to
know
that
you
do
not
altogether
disapprove
of
my
conduct
under
some
provocation
you
see
father
the
whole
responsibility
of
ordering
the
dinners
falls
on
me
and
when
there
is
company
as
there
is
this
evening
the
responsibility
is
particularly
trying
to
a
timid
person
like
a
large
dinner
party
miss
notman
oh
dear
no
quite
the
reverse
only
one
gentleman
father
benwell
set
down
his
cup
of
coffee
half
way
to
his
lips
he
at
once
drew
the
correct
conclusion
that
the
invitation
to
romayne
must
have
been
given
and
accepted
after
he
had
left
the
picture
gallery
that
the
object
was
to
bring
romayne
and
stella
together
under
circumstances
which
would
rapidly
improve
their
acquaintance
was
as
plain
to
him
as
if
he
had
heard
it
confessed
in
so
many
words
if
he
had
only
remained
in
the
gallery
he
might
have
become
acquainted
with
the
form
of
persuasion
used
to
induce
a
man
so
unsocial
as
romayne
to
accept
an
invitation
i
have
myself
to
blame
he
thought
bitterly
for
being
left
in
the
anything
wrong
with
the
coffee
miss
notman
asked
anxiously
he
rushed
on
his
fate
he
said
nothing
whatever
pray
go
miss
notman
went
on
you
see
father
lady
loring
was
unusually
particular
about
the
dinner
on
this
occasion
she
said
lord
loring
reminds
me
that
romayne
is
a
very
little
eater
and
yet
very
difficult
to
please
in
what
he
does
of
course
i
consulted
my
experience
and
suggested
exactly
the
sort
of
dinner
that
was
wanted
under
the
circumstances
i
wish
to
do
her
ladyship
the
utmost
justice
she
made
no
objection
to
the
dinner
in
itself
on
the
contrary
she
complimented
me
on
what
she
was
pleased
to
call
my
ready
invention
but
when
we
came
next
to
the
order
in
which
the
dishes
were
to
be
served
miss
notman
paused
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence
and
shuddered
over
the
private
and
poignant
recollections
which
the
order
of
the
dishes
called
up
by
this
time
father
benwell
had
discovered
his
mistake
he
took
a
mean
advantage
of
miss
notman
s
susceptibilities
to
slip
his
own
private
inquiries
into
the
interval
of
silence
pardon
my
ignorance
he
said
my
own
poor
dinner
is
a
matter
of
ten
minutes
and
one
dish
i
don
t
understand
a
difference
of
opinion
on
a
dinner
for
three
people
only
lord
and
lady
loring
two
romayne
three
oh
perhaps
i
am
mistaken
perhaps
miss
eyrecourt
makes
a
fourth
certainly
father
a
very
charming
person
miss
notman
i
only
speak
as
a
stranger
you
no
doubt
are
much
better
acquainted
with
miss
eyrecourt
much
better
indeed
if
i
may
presume
to
say
so
miss
notman
replied
she
is
my
lady
s
intimate
friend
we
have
often
talked
of
miss
eyrecourt
during
the
many
years
of
my
residence
in
this
house
on
such
subjects
her
ladyship
treats
me
quite
on
the
footing
of
a
humble
friend
a
complete
contrast
to
the
tone
she
took
father
when
we
came
to
the
order
of
the
dishes
we
agreed
of
course
about
the
soup
and
the
fish
but
we
had
a
little
a
very
little
divergence
of
opinion
as
i
may
call
it
on
the
subject
of
the
dishes
to
follow
her
ladyship
said
first
the
sweetbreads
and
then
the
i
ventured
to
suggest
that
the
sweetbreads
as
white
meat
had
better
not
immediately
follow
the
turbot
as
white
fish
the
brown
meat
my
lady
i
said
as
an
agreeable
variety
presented
to
the
eye
and
then
the
white
meat
recalling
pleasant
remembrances
of
the
white
you
see
the
point
father
i
see
miss
notman
that
you
are
a
consummate
mistress
of
an
art
which
is
quite
beyond
poor
me
was
miss
eyrecourt
present
at
the
little
discussion
oh
no
indeed
i
should
have
objected
to
her
presence
i
should
have
said
she
was
a
young
lady
out
of
her
proper
yes
i
understand
is
miss
eyrecourt
an
only
child
she
had
two
sisters
father
benwell
one
of
them
is
in
a
ah
indeed
and
the
other
is
sad
for
the
father
and
mother
miss
notman
pardon
me
sad
for
the
mother
no
doubt
the
father
died
long
aye
aye
a
sweet
woman
the
mother
at
least
i
think
i
have
heard
miss
notman
shook
her
head
i
should
wish
to
guard
myself
against
speaking
unjustly
of
any
one
she
said
but
when
you
talk
of
a
sweet
woman
you
imply
as
it
seems
to
me
the
domestic
virtues
eyrecourt
is
essentially
a
frivolous
a
frivolous
person
is
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
a
person
easily
persuaded
to
talk
and
not
disposed
to
be
reticent
in
keeping
secrets
father
benwell
began
to
see
his
way
already
to
the
necessary
information
is
eyrecourt
living
in
london
he
inquired
oh
dear
no
at
this
time
of
year
she
lives
entirely
in
other
people
s
houses
goes
from
one
country
seat
to
another
and
only
thinks
of
amusing
herself
no
domestic
qualities
father
would
know
nothing
of
the
order
of
the
dishes
lady
loring
i
should
have
told
you
gave
way
in
the
matter
of
the
sweetbread
it
was
only
at
quite
the
latter
part
of
my
menoo
as
the
french
call
it
that
she
showed
a
spirit
of
opposition
well
well
i
won
t
dwell
on
that
i
will
only
ask
father
at
what
part
of
a
dinner
an
ought
to
be
served
father
benwell
seized
his
opportunity
of
discovering
eyrecourt
s
present
address
my
dear
lady
he
said
i
know
no
more
when
the
omelet
ought
to
be
served
than
eyrecourt
herself
it
must
be
very
pleasant
to
a
lady
of
her
way
of
thinking
to
enjoy
the
beauties
of
nature
inexpensively
as
seen
in
other
people
s
houses
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
welcome
guest
i
wonder
whether
she
is
staying
at
any
country
seat
which
i
happen
to
have
seen
she
may
be
in
england
scotland
or
ireland
for
all
i
know
miss
notman
answered
with
an
unaffected
ignorance
which
placed
her
good
faith
beyond
doubt
consult
your
own
taste
father
after
eating
jelly
cream
and
could
you
even
at
an
without
shuddering
would
you
believe
it
her
ladyship
proposed
to
serve
the
omelet
with
the
cheese
oysters
after
sweets
i
am
not
as
yet
a
married
woman
father
benwell
made
a
last
desperate
effort
to
pave
the
way
for
one
more
question
before
he
submitted
to
defeat
that
must
be
fault
my
dear
lady
he
interposed
with
his
persuasive
smile
miss
notman
simpered
you
confuse
me
father
she
said
softly
i
speak
from
inward
conviction
miss
notman
to
a
like
myself
it
is
sad
to
see
how
many
sweet
women
who
might
be
angels
in
the
households
of
worthy
men
prefer
to
lead
a
single
life
the
church
i
know
exalts
the
single
life
to
the
highest
place
but
even
the
church
allows
exceptions
to
its
rule
under
this
roof
for
example
i
think
i
see
two
exceptions
one
of
them
my
unfeigned
respect
he
bowed
to
miss
notman
forbids
me
to
indicate
more
particularly
the
other
seems
to
my
humble
view
to
be
the
young
lady
of
whom
we
have
been
speaking
is
it
not
strange
that
miss
eyrecourt
has
never
been
married
the
trap
had
been
elaborately
set
father
benwell
had
every
reason
to
anticipate
that
miss
notman
would
walk
into
it
the
disconcerting
housekeeper
walked
up
to
it
and
then
proved
unable
to
advance
a
step
further
i
once
made
the
same
remark
myself
to
lady
loring
she
said
father
benwell
s
pulse
began
to
quicken
its
beat
yes
he
murmured
in
tones
of
the
gentlest
encouragement
and
her
ladyship
miss
notman
proceeded
did
not
encourage
me
to
go
on
there
are
reasons
for
not
pursuing
that
subject
she
said
reasons
into
which
i
am
sure
you
will
not
expect
me
to
she
spoke
with
a
flattering
confidence
in
my
prudence
which
i
felt
gratefully
such
a
contrast
to
her
tone
when
the
omelet
presented
itself
in
the
order
of
the
dishes
as
i
said
just
now
i
am
not
a
married
woman
but
if
i
proposed
to
my
husband
to
give
him
an
after
his
puddings
and
his
pies
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
he
said
to
me
my
dear
have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses
i
reminded
lady
loring
most
respectfully
that
a
might
be
in
its
proper
place
if
it
followed
the
sweets
an
i
suggested
surely
comes
after
the
birds
i
should
be
sorry
to
say
that
her
ladyship
lost
her
temper
i
will
only
mention
that
i
kept
mine
let
me
repeat
what
she
said
and
leave
you
father
to
draw
your
own
conclusions
she
said
which
of
us
is
mistress
in
this
house
miss
notman
i
order
the
to
come
in
with
the
there
was
not
only
irritability
there
was
contempt
oh
yes
contempt
in
her
tone
out
of
respect
for
myself
i
made
no
reply
as
a
christian
i
can
forgive
as
a
wounded
gentlewoman
i
may
not
find
it
so
easy
to
miss
notman
laid
herself
back
in
her
easy
chair
she
looked
as
if
she
had
suffered
martyrdom
and
only
regretted
having
been
obliged
to
mention
it
father
benwell
surprised
the
wounded
gentlewoman
by
rising
to
his
feet
you
are
not
going
away
already
father
time
flies
fast
in
your
society
dear
miss
notman
i
have
an
engagement
and
i
am
late
for
it
the
housekeeper
smiled
sadly
at
least
let
me
hear
that
you
don
t
disapprove
of
my
conduct
under
trying
circumstances
she
said
father
benwell
took
her
hand
a
true
christian
only
feels
offenses
to
pardon
them
he
remarked
in
his
priestly
and
paternal
character
you
have
shown
me
miss
notman
that
are
a
true
christian
my
evening
has
indeed
been
well
spent
god
bless
you
he
pressed
her
hand
he
shed
on
her
the
light
of
his
fatherly
smile
he
sighed
and
took
his
leave
miss
notman
s
eyes
followed
him
out
with
devotional
admiration
father
benwell
still
preserved
his
serenity
of
temper
when
he
was
out
of
the
housekeeper
s
sight
one
important
discovery
he
had
made
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
placed
in
his
way
a
compromising
circumstance
had
unquestionably
occurred
in
stella
s
past
life
and
in
all
probability
a
man
was
in
some
way
connected
with
it
my
evening
has
not
been
entirely
thrown
away
he
thought
as
he
ascended
the
stairs
which
led
from
the
housekeeper
s
room
to
the
hall
chapter
vii
the
influence
of
stella
entering
the
hall
father
benwell
heard
a
knock
at
the
house
door
the
servants
appeared
to
recognize
the
knock
the
porter
admitted
lord
loring
father
benwell
advanced
and
made
his
bow
it
was
a
perfect
obeisance
of
its
kind
respect
for
lord
loring
unobtrusively
accompanied
by
respect
for
himself
has
your
lordship
been
walking
in
the
park
he
inquired
i
have
been
out
on
business
lord
loring
answered
and
i
should
like
to
tell
you
about
it
if
you
can
spare
me
a
few
minutes
come
into
the
library
some
time
since
he
resumed
when
the
door
was
closed
i
think
i
mentioned
that
my
friends
had
been
speaking
to
me
on
a
subject
of
some
importance
the
subject
of
opening
my
picture
gallery
occasionally
to
the
i
remember
said
father
benwell
has
your
lordship
decided
what
to
do
yes
i
have
decided
as
the
phrase
is
to
go
with
the
times
and
follow
the
example
of
other
owners
of
picture
galleries
don
t
suppose
i
ever
doubted
that
it
is
my
duty
to
extend
to
the
best
of
my
ability
the
civilizing
influences
of
art
my
only
hesitation
in
the
matter
arose
from
a
dread
of
some
accident
happening
or
some
injury
being
done
to
the
pictures
even
now
i
can
only
persuade
myself
to
try
the
experiment
under
certain
a
wise
decision
undoubtedly
said
father
benwell
in
such
a
city
as
this
you
could
hardly
open
your
gallery
to
anybody
who
happens
to
pass
the
i
am
glad
you
agree
with
me
father
the
gallery
will
be
open
for
the
first
time
on
monday
any
person
presenting
a
visiting
card
at
the
offices
of
the
librarians
in
bond
street
and
regent
street
will
receive
a
free
ticket
of
admission
the
number
of
tickets
it
is
needless
to
say
being
limited
and
the
gallery
being
only
open
to
the
public
two
days
in
the
week
you
will
be
here
i
suppose
on
monday
certainly
my
work
in
the
library
as
your
lordship
can
see
has
only
i
am
very
anxious
about
the
success
of
this
experiment
said
lord
loring
do
look
in
at
the
gallery
once
or
twice
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
tell
me
what
your
own
impression
having
expressed
his
readiness
to
assist
the
experiment
in
every
possible
way
father
benwell
still
lingered
in
the
library
he
was
secretly
conscious
of
a
hope
that
he
might
at
the
eleventh
hour
be
invited
to
join
romayne
at
the
lord
loring
only
looked
at
the
clock
on
the
it
was
nearly
time
to
dress
for
dinner
the
priest
had
no
alternative
but
to
take
the
hint
and
leave
the
house
five
minutes
after
he
had
withdrawn
a
messenger
delivered
a
letter
for
lord
loring
in
which
father
benwell
s
interests
were
directly
involved
the
letter
was
from
romayne
it
contained
his
excuses
for
breaking
his
engagement
literally
at
an
hour
s
notice
only
yesterday
he
wrote
i
had
a
return
of
what
you
my
dear
friend
call
the
delusion
of
the
the
nearer
the
hour
of
your
dinner
approaches
the
more
keenly
i
fear
that
the
same
thing
may
happen
in
your
house
pity
me
and
forgive
even
lord
loring
felt
some
difficulty
in
pitying
and
forgiving
when
he
read
these
lines
this
sort
of
caprice
might
be
excusable
in
a
woman
he
thought
a
man
ought
really
to
be
capable
of
exercising
some
poor
stella
and
what
will
my
wife
say
he
walked
up
and
down
the
library
with
stella
s
disappointment
and
lady
loring
s
indignation
prophetically
present
in
his
mind
there
was
however
no
help
for
it
he
must
accept
his
responsibility
and
be
the
bearer
of
the
bad
news
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
library
when
a
visitor
appeared
the
visitor
was
no
less
a
person
than
romayne
himself
have
i
arrived
before
my
letter
he
asked
eagerly
lord
loring
showed
him
the
letter
throw
it
into
the
fire
he
said
and
let
me
try
to
excuse
myself
for
having
written
it
you
remember
the
happier
days
when
you
used
to
call
me
the
creature
of
impulse
an
impulse
produced
that
letter
another
impulse
brings
me
here
to
disown
it
i
can
only
explain
my
strange
conduct
by
asking
you
to
help
me
at
the
outset
will
you
carry
your
memory
back
to
the
day
of
the
medical
consultation
on
my
case
i
want
you
to
correct
me
if
i
inadvertently
misrepresent
my
advisers
two
of
them
were
physicians
the
third
and
last
was
a
surgeon
a
personal
friend
of
yours
and
as
well
as
i
recollect
told
you
how
the
consultation
ended
quite
right
romayne
so
the
first
of
the
two
physicians
romayne
proceeded
declared
my
case
to
be
entirely
attributable
to
nervous
derangement
and
to
be
curable
by
purely
medical
means
i
speak
ignorantly
but
in
plain
english
that
i
believe
was
the
substance
of
what
he
said
the
substance
of
what
he
said
lord
loring
replied
and
the
substance
of
his
prescriptions
which
i
think
you
afterward
tore
up
if
you
have
no
faith
in
a
prescription
said
romayne
that
is
in
my
opinion
the
best
use
to
which
you
can
put
it
when
it
came
to
the
turn
of
the
second
physician
he
differed
with
the
first
as
absolutely
as
one
man
can
differ
with
another
the
third
medical
authority
your
friend
the
surgeon
took
a
middle
course
and
brought
the
consultation
to
an
end
by
combining
the
first
physician
s
view
and
the
second
physician
s
view
and
mingling
the
two
opposite
forms
of
treatment
in
one
harmonious
result
lord
loring
remarked
that
this
was
not
a
very
respectful
way
of
describing
the
conclusion
of
the
medical
proceedings
that
it
was
the
conclusion
however
he
could
not
honestly
deny
as
long
as
i
am
right
said
romayne
nothing
else
appears
to
be
of
much
importance
as
i
told
you
at
the
time
the
second
physician
appeared
to
me
to
be
the
only
one
of
the
three
authorities
who
really
understood
my
case
do
you
mind
giving
me
in
few
words
your
own
impression
of
what
he
said
are
you
sure
that
i
shall
not
distress
you
on
the
contrary
you
may
help
me
to
as
i
remember
it
said
lord
loring
the
doctor
did
not
deny
the
influence
of
the
body
over
the
mind
he
was
quite
willing
to
admit
that
the
state
of
your
nervous
system
might
be
one
among
other
predisposing
causes
which
led
you
i
really
hardly
like
to
go
which
led
me
romayne
continued
finishing
the
sentence
for
his
friend
to
feel
that
i
never
shall
forgive
myself
accident
or
no
accident
for
having
taken
that
man
s
life
now
go
the
delusion
that
you
still
hear
the
voice
lord
loring
proceeded
is
in
the
doctor
s
opinion
the
moral
result
of
the
morbid
state
of
your
mind
at
the
time
when
you
really
heard
the
voice
on
the
scene
of
the
duel
the
influence
acts
physically
of
course
by
means
of
certain
nerves
but
it
is
essentially
a
moral
influence
and
its
power
over
you
is
greatly
maintained
by
the
view
of
the
circumstances
which
you
persist
in
taking
that
in
substance
is
my
recollection
of
what
the
doctor
and
when
he
was
asked
what
remedies
he
proposed
to
try
romayne
inquired
do
you
remember
his
answer
the
mischief
which
moral
influences
have
caused
moral
influences
alone
can
i
remember
said
lord
loring
and
he
mentioned
as
examples
of
what
he
meant
the
occurrence
of
some
new
and
absorbing
interest
in
your
life
or
the
working
of
some
complete
change
in
your
habits
of
thought
or
perhaps
some
influence
exercised
over
you
by
a
person
previously
unknown
appearing
under
unforeseen
circumstances
or
in
scenes
quite
new
to
romayne
s
eyes
sparkled
now
you
are
coming
to
it
he
cried
now
i
feel
sure
that
i
recall
correctly
the
last
words
the
doctor
said
if
my
view
is
the
right
one
i
should
not
be
surprised
to
hear
that
the
recovery
which
we
all
wish
to
see
had
found
its
beginning
in
such
apparently
trifling
circumstances
as
the
tone
of
some
other
person
s
voice
or
the
influence
of
some
other
person
s
that
plain
expression
of
his
opinion
only
occurred
to
my
memory
after
i
had
written
my
foolish
letter
of
excuse
i
spare
you
the
course
of
other
recollections
that
followed
to
come
at
once
to
the
result
for
the
first
time
i
have
the
hope
the
faint
hope
that
the
voice
which
haunts
me
has
been
once
already
controlled
by
one
of
the
influences
of
which
the
doctor
spoke
the
influence
of
a
if
he
had
said
this
to
lady
loring
instead
of
to
her
husband
she
would
have
understood
him
at
once
lord
loring
asked
for
a
word
more
of
explanation
i
told
you
yesterday
romayne
answered
that
a
dread
of
the
return
of
the
voice
had
been
present
to
me
all
the
morning
and
that
i
had
come
to
see
the
picture
with
an
idea
of
trying
if
change
would
relieve
me
while
i
was
in
the
gallery
i
was
free
from
the
dread
and
free
from
the
voice
when
i
returned
to
the
hotel
it
tortured
me
and
penrose
i
grieve
to
say
saw
what
i
suffered
you
and
i
attributed
the
remission
to
the
change
of
scene
i
now
believe
we
were
both
wrong
where
was
the
change
in
seeing
you
and
lady
loring
i
saw
the
two
oldest
friends
i
have
in
visiting
your
gallery
i
only
revived
the
familiar
associations
of
hundreds
of
other
visits
to
what
influence
was
i
really
indebted
for
my
respite
don
t
try
to
dismiss
the
question
by
laughing
at
my
morbid
fancies
morbid
fancies
are
realities
to
a
man
like
me
remember
the
doctor
s
words
loring
think
of
a
new
face
seen
in
your
house
think
of
a
look
that
searched
my
heart
for
the
first
time
lord
loring
glanced
once
more
at
the
clock
on
the
the
hands
pointed
to
the
dinner
hour
miss
eyrecourt
he
whispered
yes
miss
the
library
door
was
thrown
open
by
a
servant
stella
herself
entered
the
room
chapter
viii
the
priest
or
the
woman
lord
loring
hurried
away
to
his
dressing
room
i
won
t
be
more
than
ten
minutes
he
said
and
left
romayne
and
stella
together
she
was
attired
with
her
customary
love
of
simplicity
white
lace
was
the
only
ornament
on
her
dress
of
delicate
silvery
gray
her
magnificent
hair
was
left
to
plead
its
own
merits
without
adornment
of
any
sort
even
the
brooch
which
fastened
her
lace
pelerine
was
of
plain
gold
only
conscious
that
she
was
showing
her
beauty
to
the
greatest
advantage
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
of
taste
she
betrayed
a
little
of
the
embarrassment
which
romayne
had
already
noticed
at
the
moment
when
she
gave
him
her
hand
they
were
alone
and
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
seen
him
in
evening
dress
it
may
be
that
women
have
no
positive
appreciation
of
what
is
beautiful
in
form
and
color
or
it
may
be
that
they
have
no
opinions
of
their
own
when
the
laws
of
fashion
have
spoken
this
at
least
is
certain
that
not
one
of
them
in
a
thousand
sees
anything
objectionable
in
the
gloomy
and
hideous
evening
costume
of
a
gentleman
in
the
nineteenth
century
a
handsome
man
is
to
their
eyes
more
seductive
than
ever
in
the
contemptible
black
coat
and
the
stiff
white
cravat
which
he
wears
in
common
with
the
servant
who
waits
on
him
at
table
after
a
stolen
glance
at
romayne
stella
lost
all
confidence
in
herself
she
began
turning
over
the
photographs
on
the
table
the
momentary
silence
which
followed
their
first
greeting
became
intolerable
to
her
rather
than
let
it
continue
she
impulsively
confessed
the
uppermost
idea
in
her
mind
when
she
entered
the
room
i
thought
i
heard
my
name
when
i
came
in
she
said
were
you
and
lord
loring
speaking
of
me
romayne
owned
without
hesitation
that
they
had
been
speaking
of
her
she
smiled
and
turned
over
another
photograph
but
when
did
ever
act
as
a
restraint
on
a
woman
s
curiosity
the
words
passed
her
lips
in
spite
of
her
i
suppose
i
mustn
t
ask
what
you
were
saying
it
was
impossible
to
answer
this
plainly
without
entering
into
explanations
from
which
romayne
shrank
he
hesitated
she
turned
over
another
photograph
i
understand
she
said
you
were
talking
of
my
she
paused
and
stole
another
look
at
him
i
will
try
to
correct
my
faults
if
you
will
tell
me
what
they
romayne
felt
that
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
tell
the
truth
under
certain
reserves
indeed
you
are
wrong
he
said
we
were
talking
of
the
influence
of
a
tone
or
a
look
on
a
sensitive
the
influence
on
me
she
asked
no
the
influence
which
you
might
exercise
on
another
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
was
speaking
of
himself
but
she
was
determined
to
feel
the
pleasure
of
making
him
own
it
if
i
have
any
such
influence
as
you
describe
she
began
i
hope
it
is
for
good
certainly
for
you
speak
positively
romayne
almost
as
positively
only
that
can
hardly
be
as
if
you
were
speaking
from
he
might
still
have
evaded
a
direct
reply
if
she
had
been
content
with
merely
saying
this
but
she
looked
at
him
while
she
spoke
he
answered
the
look
shall
i
own
that
you
are
right
he
said
i
was
thinking
of
my
own
experience
she
returned
to
the
photographs
it
sounds
impossible
she
rejoined
softly
there
was
a
pause
was
it
anything
i
said
she
asked
no
it
was
only
when
you
looked
at
me
but
for
that
look
i
don
t
think
i
should
have
been
here
she
shut
up
the
photographs
on
a
sudden
and
drew
her
chair
a
little
away
from
him
i
hope
she
said
you
have
not
so
poor
an
opinion
of
me
as
to
think
i
like
to
be
flattered
romayne
answered
with
an
earnestness
that
instantly
satisfied
her
i
should
think
it
an
act
of
insolence
to
flatter
you
he
said
if
you
knew
the
true
reason
why
i
hesitated
to
accept
lady
loring
s
invitation
if
i
could
own
to
you
the
new
hope
for
myself
that
has
brought
me
here
you
would
feel
as
i
feel
that
i
have
been
only
speaking
the
truth
i
daren
t
say
yet
that
i
owe
you
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
such
a
little
thing
as
a
look
i
must
wait
till
time
puts
certain
strange
fancies
of
mine
to
the
fancies
about
me
romayne
before
he
could
answer
the
dinner
bell
rang
lord
and
lady
loring
entered
the
library
together
the
dinner
having
pursued
its
appointed
course
always
excepting
the
case
of
the
omelet
the
head
servant
who
had
waited
at
table
was
graciously
invited
to
rest
after
his
labors
in
the
housekeeper
s
room
having
additionally
conciliated
him
by
means
of
a
glass
of
rare
liqueur
miss
notman
still
feeling
her
grievance
as
acutely
as
ever
ventured
to
inquire
in
the
first
place
if
the
gentlefolks
upstairs
had
enjoyed
their
dinner
so
far
the
report
was
on
the
whole
favorable
but
the
conversation
was
described
as
occasionally
flagging
the
burden
of
the
talk
had
been
mainly
borne
by
my
lord
and
my
lady
romayne
and
miss
eyrecourt
contributing
but
little
to
the
social
enjoyment
of
the
evening
receiving
this
information
without
much
appearance
of
interest
the
housekeeper
put
another
question
to
which
judging
by
her
manner
she
attached
a
certain
importance
she
wished
to
know
if
the
accompanying
the
cheese
had
been
received
as
a
welcome
dish
and
treated
with
a
just
recognition
of
its
merits
the
answer
to
this
was
decidedly
in
the
negative
romayne
and
miss
eyrecourt
had
declined
to
taste
it
my
lord
had
tried
it
and
had
left
it
on
his
plate
my
lady
alone
had
really
eaten
her
share
of
the
misplaced
dish
having
stated
this
apparently
trivial
circumstance
the
head
servant
was
surprised
by
the
effect
which
it
produced
on
the
housekeeper
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
closed
her
eyes
with
an
appearance
of
unutterable
enjoyment
that
night
there
was
one
supremely
happy
woman
in
london
and
her
name
was
miss
notman
ascending
from
the
housekeeper
s
room
to
the
it
is
to
be
further
reported
that
music
was
tried
as
a
means
of
getting
through
the
time
in
the
absence
of
general
conversation
lady
loring
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
played
as
admirably
as
usual
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
romayne
and
stella
were
together
listening
to
the
music
lord
loring
walking
backward
and
forward
with
a
restlessness
which
was
far
from
being
characteristic
of
him
in
his
hours
was
stopped
when
he
reached
the
neighborhood
of
the
piano
by
a
private
signal
from
his
wife
what
are
you
walking
about
for
lady
loring
asked
in
a
whisper
without
interrupting
her
musical
performance
i
m
not
quite
easy
my
turn
over
the
music
indigestion
good
heavens
adelaide
what
a
question
well
what
is
it
then
lord
loring
looked
toward
stella
and
her
companion
they
don
t
seem
to
get
on
together
as
well
as
i
had
hoped
he
said
i
should
think
not
when
you
are
walking
about
and
disturbing
them
sit
down
there
behind
what
am
i
to
do
am
i
not
playing
listen
to
my
dear
i
don
t
understand
modern
german
then
read
the
evening
the
evening
paper
had
its
attractions
lord
loring
took
his
wife
s
advice
left
entirely
by
themselves
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
romayne
and
stella
justified
lady
loring
s
belief
in
the
result
of
reducing
her
husband
to
a
state
of
repose
stella
ventured
to
speak
first
in
a
discreet
undertone
do
you
pass
most
of
your
evenings
alone
romayne
not
quite
alone
i
have
the
company
of
my
are
your
books
the
companions
that
you
like
best
i
have
been
true
to
those
companions
miss
eyrecourt
for
many
years
if
the
doctors
are
to
be
believed
my
books
have
not
treated
me
very
well
in
return
they
have
broken
down
my
health
and
have
made
me
i
am
afraid
a
very
unsocial
he
seemed
about
to
say
more
and
suddenly
checked
the
impulse
why
am
i
talking
of
myself
he
resumed
with
a
smile
i
never
do
it
at
other
times
is
this
another
result
of
your
influence
over
me
he
put
the
question
with
an
assumed
gayety
stella
made
no
effort
on
her
side
to
answer
him
in
the
same
tone
i
almost
wish
i
really
had
some
influence
over
you
she
said
gravely
and
sadly
why
i
should
try
to
induce
you
to
shut
up
your
books
and
choose
some
living
companion
who
might
restore
you
to
your
happier
it
is
already
done
said
romayne
i
have
a
new
companion
in
penrose
she
repeated
he
is
the
friend
is
he
not
of
the
priest
here
whom
they
call
father
benwell
i
don
t
like
father
is
that
a
reason
for
disliking
penrose
yes
she
said
boldly
because
he
is
father
benwell
s
indeed
you
are
mistaken
miss
eyrecourt
penrose
only
entered
yesterday
on
his
duties
as
my
secretary
and
i
have
already
had
reason
to
think
highly
of
him
many
men
after
experience
of
me
he
added
speaking
more
to
himself
than
to
her
might
have
asked
me
to
find
another
stella
heard
those
last
words
and
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
were
you
angry
with
penrose
she
asked
innocently
is
it
possible
that
could
speak
harshly
to
any
person
in
your
employment
romayne
smiled
it
was
not
what
i
said
he
answered
i
am
subject
to
attacks
to
sudden
attacks
of
illness
i
am
sorry
i
alarmed
penrose
by
letting
him
see
me
under
those
she
looked
at
him
hesitated
and
looked
away
again
would
you
be
angry
with
me
if
i
confessed
something
she
said
timidly
it
is
impossible
i
can
be
angry
with
you
mr
romayne
i
think
i
have
seen
what
your
secretary
saw
i
know
how
you
suffer
and
how
patiently
you
bear
you
he
exclaimed
i
saw
you
with
your
friend
when
you
came
on
board
the
steamboat
at
boulogne
oh
no
you
never
noticed
me
you
never
knew
how
i
pitied
you
and
afterward
when
you
moved
away
by
yourself
and
stood
by
the
place
in
which
the
engines
work
you
are
sure
you
won
t
think
the
worse
of
me
if
i
tell
it
no
no
your
face
frightened
me
i
can
t
describe
it
i
went
to
your
friend
and
took
it
on
myself
to
say
that
you
wanted
him
it
was
an
impulse
i
meant
i
am
sure
you
meant
as
he
spoke
his
face
darkened
a
little
betraying
a
momentary
feeling
of
distrust
had
she
put
indiscreet
questions
to
his
traveling
companion
and
had
the
major
under
the
persuasive
influence
of
her
beauty
been
weak
enough
to
answer
them
did
you
speak
to
my
friend
he
asked
only
when
i
told
him
that
he
had
better
go
to
you
and
i
think
i
said
afterward
i
was
afraid
you
were
very
we
were
in
the
confusion
of
arriving
at
folkestone
and
even
if
i
had
thought
it
right
to
say
more
there
was
no
romayne
felt
ashamed
of
the
suspicion
by
which
he
had
wronged
her
you
have
a
generous
nature
he
said
earnestly
among
the
few
people
whom
i
know
how
many
would
feel
the
interest
in
me
that
you
felt
don
t
say
that
romayne
you
could
have
had
no
kinder
friend
than
the
gentleman
who
took
care
of
you
on
your
journey
is
he
with
you
now
in
london
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
you
ought
to
have
some
devoted
friend
always
near
she
spoke
very
earnestly
romayne
shrank
with
a
strange
shyness
from
letting
her
see
how
her
sympathy
affected
him
he
answered
lightly
you
go
almost
as
far
as
my
good
friend
there
reading
the
newspaper
he
said
lord
loring
doesn
t
scruple
to
tell
me
that
i
ought
to
marry
i
know
he
speaks
with
a
sincere
interest
in
my
welfare
he
little
thinks
how
he
distresses
why
should
he
distress
you
he
reminds
me
live
as
long
as
i
may
that
i
must
live
alone
can
i
ask
a
woman
to
share
such
a
dreary
life
as
mine
it
would
be
selfish
it
would
be
cruel
i
should
deservedly
pay
the
penalty
of
allowing
my
wife
to
sacrifice
herself
the
time
would
come
when
she
would
repent
having
married
stella
rose
her
eyes
rested
on
him
with
a
look
of
gentle
remonstrance
i
think
you
hardly
do
women
justice
she
said
softly
perhaps
some
day
a
woman
may
induce
you
to
change
your
she
crossed
the
room
to
the
piano
you
must
be
tired
of
playing
adelaide
she
said
putting
her
hand
caressingly
on
lady
loring
s
shoulder
will
you
sing
stella
she
sighed
and
turned
away
not
she
answered
romayne
took
his
leave
rather
hurriedly
he
seemed
to
be
out
of
spirits
and
eager
to
get
away
lord
loring
accompanied
his
guest
to
the
door
you
look
sad
and
careworn
he
said
do
you
regret
having
left
your
books
to
pass
an
evening
with
us
romayne
looked
up
absently
and
answered
i
don
t
know
returning
to
report
this
extraordinary
reply
to
his
wife
and
stella
lord
loring
found
the
empty
eager
for
a
little
private
conversation
the
two
ladies
had
gone
upstairs
well
said
lady
loring
as
they
sat
together
over
the
fire
what
did
he
say
stella
only
repeated
what
he
had
said
before
she
rose
and
left
him
what
is
there
in
romayne
s
life
she
asked
which
made
him
say
that
he
would
be
selfish
and
cruel
if
he
expected
a
woman
to
marry
him
it
must
be
something
more
than
mere
illness
if
he
had
committed
a
crime
he
could
not
have
spoken
more
strongly
do
you
know
what
it
is
lady
loring
looked
uneasy
i
promised
my
husband
to
keep
it
a
secret
from
everybody
she
said
it
is
nothing
degrading
adelaide
i
am
sure
of
and
you
are
right
my
dear
i
can
understand
that
he
has
surprised
and
disappointed
you
but
if
you
knew
his
motives
she
stopped
and
looked
earnestly
at
stella
they
say
she
went
on
the
love
that
lasts
longest
is
the
love
of
slowest
growth
this
feeling
of
yours
for
romayne
is
of
sudden
growth
are
you
very
sure
that
your
whole
heart
is
given
to
a
man
of
whom
you
know
little
i
know
that
i
love
him
said
stella
simply
even
though
he
doesn
t
seem
as
yet
to
love
you
lady
loring
asked
all
the
more
he
doesn
t
i
should
be
ashamed
to
make
the
confession
to
any
one
but
you
it
is
useless
to
say
any
more
lady
loring
allowed
her
to
get
as
far
as
the
door
and
then
suddenly
called
her
back
stella
returned
unwillingly
and
wearily
my
head
aches
and
my
heart
aches
she
said
let
me
go
away
to
my
i
don
t
like
you
to
go
away
wronging
romayne
perhaps
in
your
thoughts
said
lady
loring
and
more
than
that
for
the
sake
of
your
own
happiness
you
ought
to
judge
for
yourself
if
this
devoted
love
of
yours
may
ever
hope
to
win
its
reward
it
is
time
and
more
than
time
that
you
should
decide
whether
it
is
good
for
you
to
see
romayne
again
have
you
courage
enough
to
do
that
yes
if
i
am
convinced
that
it
ought
to
be
nothing
would
make
me
so
happy
lady
loring
resumed
as
to
know
that
you
were
one
day
my
dear
to
be
his
wife
but
i
am
not
a
prudent
person
i
can
never
look
as
you
can
to
consequences
you
won
t
betray
me
stella
if
i
am
doing
wrong
in
telling
a
secret
which
has
been
trusted
to
me
it
is
my
fondness
for
you
that
misleads
me
sit
down
again
you
shall
know
what
the
misery
of
romayne
s
life
really
with
those
words
she
told
the
terrible
story
of
the
duel
and
of
all
that
had
followed
it
it
is
for
you
to
say
she
concluded
whether
romayne
is
right
can
any
woman
hope
to
release
him
from
the
torment
that
he
suffers
with
nothing
to
help
her
but
love
determine
for
stella
answered
instantly
i
determine
to
be
his
wife
with
the
same
pure
enthusiasm
penrose
had
declared
that
he
too
devoted
himself
to
the
deliverance
of
romayne
the
loving
woman
was
not
more
resolved
to
give
her
whole
life
to
him
than
the
fanatical
man
was
resolved
to
convert
him
on
the
same
common
the
two
were
now
to
meet
in
unconscious
antagonism
would
the
priest
or
the
woman
win
the
day
chapter
ix
the
public
and
the
pictures
on
the
memorable
monday
when
the
picture
gallery
was
opened
to
the
public
for
the
first
time
lord
loring
and
father
benwell
met
in
the
library
judging
by
the
number
of
carriages
already
at
the
door
said
father
benwell
your
lordship
s
kindness
is
largely
appreciated
by
the
lovers
of
all
the
tickets
were
disposed
of
in
three
hours
lord
loring
answered
everybody
the
librarians
tell
me
is
eager
to
see
the
pictures
have
you
looked
in
yet
not
yet
i
thought
i
would
get
on
first
with
my
work
among
the
i
have
just
come
from
the
gallery
lord
loring
continued
and
here
i
am
driven
out
of
it
again
by
the
remarks
of
some
of
the
visitors
you
know
my
beautiful
copies
of
raphael
s
cupid
and
psyche
designs
the
general
impression
especially
among
the
ladies
is
that
they
are
disgusting
and
indecent
that
was
enough
for
me
if
you
happen
to
meet
lady
loring
and
stella
kindly
tell
them
that
i
have
gone
to
the
do
the
ladies
propose
paying
a
visit
to
the
gallery
of
course
to
see
the
people
i
have
recommended
them
to
wait
until
they
are
ready
to
go
out
for
their
drive
in
their
indoor
costume
they
might
become
the
objects
of
general
observation
as
the
ladies
of
the
house
i
shall
be
anxious
to
hear
father
if
you
can
discover
the
civilizing
influences
of
art
among
my
guests
in
the
gallery
father
benwell
rang
the
bell
when
lord
loring
had
left
him
do
the
ladies
drive
out
at
their
usual
hour
he
inquired
when
the
servant
appeared
the
man
answered
in
the
affirmative
the
carriage
was
ordered
at
three
o
clock
at
two
father
benwell
slipped
quietly
into
the
gallery
he
posted
himself
midway
between
the
library
door
and
the
grand
entrance
on
the
watch
not
for
the
civilizing
influences
of
art
but
for
the
appearance
of
lady
loring
and
stella
he
was
still
of
opinion
that
stella
s
frivolous
mother
might
be
turned
into
a
source
of
valuable
information
on
the
subject
of
her
daughter
s
earlier
life
the
first
step
toward
attaining
this
object
was
to
discover
eyrecourt
s
present
address
stella
would
certainly
know
it
and
father
benwell
felt
a
just
confidence
in
his
capacity
to
make
the
young
lady
serviceable
in
this
respect
to
the
pecuniary
interests
of
the
church
after
an
interval
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
lady
loring
and
stella
entered
the
gallery
by
the
library
door
father
benwell
at
once
advanced
to
pay
his
respects
for
some
little
time
he
discreetly
refrained
from
making
any
attempt
to
lead
the
conversation
to
the
topic
that
he
had
in
view
he
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
insatiable
interest
of
women
in
looking
at
other
women
to
force
himself
into
notice
the
ladies
made
their
remarks
on
the
pretensions
to
beauty
and
to
taste
in
dress
among
the
throng
of
visitors
and
father
benwell
waited
by
them
and
listened
with
the
resignation
of
a
modest
young
man
patience
being
a
virtue
is
sometimes
its
own
reward
two
gentlemen
evidently
interested
in
the
pictures
approached
the
priest
he
drew
back
with
his
ready
politeness
to
let
them
see
the
picture
before
which
he
happened
to
be
standing
the
movement
disturbed
stella
she
turned
sharply
noticed
one
of
the
gentlemen
the
taller
of
the
two
became
deadly
pale
and
instantly
quitted
the
gallery
lady
loring
looking
where
stella
had
looked
frowned
angrily
and
followed
miss
eyrecourt
into
the
library
wise
father
benwell
let
them
go
and
concentrated
his
attention
on
the
person
who
had
been
the
object
of
this
startling
recognition
unquestionably
a
gentleman
with
light
hair
and
complexion
with
a
bright
benevolent
face
and
keen
intelligent
blue
eyes
apparently
still
in
the
prime
of
life
such
was
father
benwell
s
first
impression
of
the
stranger
he
had
evidently
seen
miss
eyrecourt
at
the
moment
when
she
first
noticed
him
and
he
too
showed
signs
of
serious
agitation
his
face
flushed
deeply
and
his
eyes
expressed
not
merely
surprise
but
distress
he
turned
to
his
friend
this
place
is
hot
he
said
let
us
get
out
of
it
my
dear
winterfield
the
friend
remonstrated
we
haven
t
seen
half
the
pictures
excuse
me
if
i
leave
you
the
other
replied
i
am
used
to
the
free
air
of
the
country
let
us
meet
again
this
evening
come
and
dine
with
me
the
same
address
as
usual
derwent
s
with
those
words
he
hurried
out
making
his
way
without
ceremony
through
the
crowd
in
the
picture
gallery
father
benwell
returned
to
the
library
it
was
quite
needless
to
trouble
himself
further
about
eyrecourt
or
her
address
thanks
to
lord
loring
s
picture
gallery
he
thought
i
have
found
the
man
he
took
up
his
pen
and
made
a
little
memorandum
winterfield
derwent
s
chapter
x
father
benwell
s
correspondence
i
bitrake
private
and
sir
i
understand
that
your
connection
with
the
law
does
not
exclude
your
occasional
superintendence
of
confidential
inquiries
which
are
not
of
a
nature
to
injure
your
professional
position
the
inclosed
letter
of
introduction
will
satisfy
you
that
i
am
incapable
of
employing
your
experience
in
a
manner
unbecoming
to
you
or
to
myself
the
inquiry
that
i
propose
to
you
relates
to
a
gentleman
named
winterfield
he
is
now
staying
in
london
at
derwent
s
hotel
and
is
expected
to
remain
there
for
a
week
from
the
present
date
his
place
of
residence
is
on
the
north
devonshire
coast
and
is
well
known
in
that
locality
by
the
name
of
beaupark
house
the
range
of
my
proposed
inquiry
dates
back
over
the
last
four
or
five
years
certainly
not
more
my
object
is
to
ascertain
as
positively
as
may
be
whether
within
this
limit
of
time
events
in
winterfield
s
life
have
connected
him
with
a
young
lady
named
miss
stella
eyrecourt
if
this
proves
to
be
the
case
it
is
essential
that
i
should
be
made
acquainted
with
the
whole
of
the
circumstances
i
have
now
informed
you
of
all
that
i
want
to
know
whatever
the
information
may
be
it
is
most
important
that
it
shall
be
information
which
i
can
implicitly
trust
please
address
to
me
when
you
write
under
cover
to
the
friend
whose
letter
i
inclose
i
beg
your
acceptance
as
time
is
of
importance
of
a
check
for
preliminary
expenses
and
remain
sir
your
faithful
servant
ambrose
benwell
ii
the
secretary
society
of
jesus
i
inclose
a
receipt
for
the
remittance
which
your
last
letter
confides
to
my
care
some
of
the
money
has
been
already
used
in
prosecuting
inquiries
the
result
of
which
will
as
i
hope
and
believe
enable
me
to
effectually
protect
romayne
from
the
advances
of
the
woman
who
is
bent
on
marrying
him
you
tell
me
that
our
reverend
fathers
lately
sitting
in
council
on
the
vange
abbey
affair
are
anxious
to
hear
if
any
positive
steps
have
yet
been
taken
toward
the
conversion
of
romayne
i
am
happily
able
to
gratify
their
wishes
as
you
shall
now
see
yesterday
i
called
at
romayne
s
hotel
to
pay
one
of
those
occasional
visits
which
help
to
keep
up
our
acquaintance
he
was
out
and
penrose
for
whom
i
asked
next
was
with
him
most
fortunately
as
the
event
proved
i
had
not
seen
penrose
or
heard
from
him
for
some
little
time
and
i
thought
it
desirable
to
judge
for
myself
of
the
progress
that
he
was
making
in
the
confidence
of
his
employer
i
said
i
would
wait
the
hotel
servant
knows
me
by
sight
i
was
shown
into
romayne
s
this
room
is
so
small
as
to
be
a
mere
cupboard
it
is
lighted
by
a
glass
fanlight
over
the
door
which
opens
from
the
passage
and
is
supplied
with
air
in
the
absence
of
a
fireplace
by
a
ventilator
in
a
second
door
which
communicates
with
romayne
s
study
looking
about
me
so
far
i
crossed
to
the
other
end
of
the
study
and
discovered
a
and
two
bedrooms
beyond
the
set
of
apartments
being
secluded
by
means
of
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
from
the
other
parts
of
the
hotel
i
trouble
you
with
these
details
in
order
that
you
may
understand
the
events
that
followed
i
returned
to
the
not
forgetting
of
course
to
close
the
door
of
communication
nearly
an
hour
must
have
passed
before
i
heard
footsteps
in
the
passage
the
study
door
was
opened
and
the
voices
of
persons
entering
the
room
reached
me
through
the
ventilator
i
recognized
romayne
penrose
and
lord
loring
the
first
words
exchanged
among
them
informed
me
that
romayne
and
his
secretary
had
overtaken
lord
loring
in
the
street
as
he
was
approaching
the
hotel
door
the
three
had
entered
the
house
together
at
a
time
probably
when
the
servant
who
had
admitted
me
was
out
of
the
way
however
it
may
have
happened
there
i
was
forgotten
in
the
could
i
intrude
myself
on
a
private
conversation
perhaps
as
an
unannounced
and
unwelcome
visitor
and
could
i
help
it
if
the
talk
found
its
way
to
me
through
the
ventilator
along
with
the
air
that
i
breathed
if
our
reverend
fathers
think
i
was
to
blame
i
bow
to
any
reproof
which
their
strict
sense
of
propriety
may
inflict
on
me
in
the
meantime
i
beg
to
repeat
the
interesting
passages
in
the
conversation
as
nearly
word
for
word
as
i
can
remember
them
his
lordship
as
the
principal
personage
in
social
rank
shall
be
reported
first
he
said
more
than
a
week
has
passed
romayne
and
we
have
neither
seen
you
nor
heard
from
you
why
have
you
neglected
us
here
judging
by
certain
sounds
that
followed
penrose
got
up
discreetly
and
left
the
room
lord
loring
went
on
he
said
to
romayne
now
we
are
alone
i
may
speak
to
you
more
freely
you
and
stella
seemed
to
get
on
together
admirably
that
evening
when
you
dined
with
us
have
you
forgotten
what
you
told
me
of
her
influence
over
you
or
have
you
altered
your
opinion
and
is
that
the
reason
why
you
keep
away
from
us
romayne
answered
my
opinion
remains
unchanged
all
that
i
said
to
you
of
miss
eyrecourt
i
believe
as
firmly
as
his
lordship
remonstrated
naturally
enough
then
why
remain
away
from
the
good
influence
why
if
it
really
be
controlled
risk
another
return
of
that
dreadful
nervous
delusion
i
have
had
another
which
as
you
yourself
believe
might
have
been
prevented
romayne
you
astonish
there
was
a
time
of
silence
before
romayne
answered
this
he
was
a
little
mysterious
when
he
did
reply
you
know
the
old
saying
my
good
friend
of
two
evils
choose
the
least
i
bear
my
sufferings
as
one
of
two
evils
and
the
least
of
the
lord
loring
appeared
to
feel
the
necessity
of
touching
a
delicate
subject
with
a
light
hand
he
said
in
his
pleasant
way
stella
isn
t
the
other
evil
i
suppose
most
assuredly
then
what
is
it
romayne
answered
almost
passionately
my
own
weakness
and
selfishness
faults
which
i
must
resist
or
become
a
mean
and
heartless
man
for
me
the
worst
of
the
two
evils
is
there
i
respect
and
admire
miss
eyrecourt
i
believe
her
to
be
a
woman
in
a
thousand
don
t
ask
me
to
see
her
again
where
is
penrose
let
us
talk
of
something
whether
this
wild
way
of
speaking
offended
lord
loring
or
only
discouraged
him
i
can
not
say
i
heard
him
take
his
leave
in
these
words
you
have
disappointed
me
romayne
we
will
talk
of
something
else
the
next
time
we
the
study
door
was
opened
and
closed
romayne
was
left
by
himself
solitude
was
apparently
not
to
his
taste
just
then
i
heard
him
call
to
penrose
i
heard
penrose
ask
do
you
want
me
romayne
answered
god
knows
i
want
a
friend
and
i
have
no
friend
near
me
but
you
major
hynd
is
away
and
lord
loring
is
offended
with
penrose
asked
why
romayne
thereupon
entered
on
the
necessary
explanation
as
a
priest
writing
to
priests
i
pass
over
details
utterly
uninteresting
to
us
the
substance
of
what
he
said
amounted
to
this
miss
eyrecourt
had
produced
an
impression
on
him
which
was
new
to
him
in
his
experience
of
women
if
he
saw
more
of
her
it
might
end
i
ask
your
pardon
for
repeating
the
ridiculous
expression
in
his
falling
in
love
with
in
this
condition
of
mind
or
body
whichever
it
may
be
he
would
probably
be
incapable
of
the
which
he
had
hitherto
practiced
if
she
consented
to
devote
her
life
to
him
he
might
accept
the
cruel
sacrifice
rather
than
do
this
he
would
keep
away
from
her
for
her
dear
sake
no
matter
what
he
might
suffer
or
whom
he
might
offend
imagine
any
human
being
out
of
a
lunatic
asylum
talking
in
this
way
shall
i
own
to
you
my
reverend
colleague
how
this
curious
struck
me
as
i
listened
to
romayne
i
felt
grateful
to
the
famous
council
which
definitely
forbade
the
priests
of
the
catholic
church
to
marry
might
otherwise
have
been
morally
enervated
by
the
weakness
which
degrades
romayne
and
priests
might
have
become
instruments
in
the
hands
of
women
but
you
will
be
anxious
to
hear
what
penrose
did
under
the
circumstances
for
the
moment
i
can
tell
you
this
he
startled
me
instead
of
seizing
the
opportunity
and
directing
romayne
s
mind
to
the
consolations
of
religion
penrose
actually
encouraged
him
to
reconsider
his
decision
all
the
weakness
of
my
poor
little
arthur
s
character
showed
itself
in
his
next
words
he
said
to
romayne
it
may
be
wrong
in
me
to
speak
to
you
as
freely
as
i
wish
to
speak
but
you
have
so
generously
admitted
me
to
your
confidence
you
have
been
so
considerate
and
so
kind
toward
me
that
i
feel
an
interest
in
your
happiness
which
perhaps
makes
me
over
bold
are
you
very
sure
that
some
such
entire
change
in
your
life
as
your
marriage
might
not
end
in
delivering
you
from
your
burden
if
such
a
thing
could
be
is
it
wrong
to
suppose
that
your
wife
s
good
influence
over
you
might
be
the
means
of
making
your
marriage
a
happy
one
i
must
not
presume
to
offer
an
opinion
on
such
a
subject
it
is
only
my
gratitude
my
true
attachment
to
you
that
ventures
to
put
the
question
are
you
conscious
of
having
given
this
matter
so
serious
a
matter
for
you
sufficient
thought
make
your
mind
easy
reverend
sir
romayne
s
answer
set
everything
right
he
said
i
have
thought
of
it
till
i
could
think
no
longer
i
still
believe
that
sweet
woman
might
control
the
torment
of
the
voice
but
could
she
deliver
me
from
the
remorse
perpetually
gnawing
at
my
heart
i
feel
as
murderers
feel
in
taking
another
man
s
life
a
man
who
had
not
even
injured
me
i
have
committed
the
one
unatonable
and
unpardonable
sin
can
any
human
creature
s
influence
make
me
forget
that
no
more
of
it
no
more
come
let
us
take
refuge
in
our
those
words
touched
penrose
in
the
right
place
now
as
i
understand
his
scruples
he
felt
that
he
might
honorably
speak
out
his
zeal
more
than
balanced
his
weakness
as
you
will
presently
see
he
was
loud
he
was
positive
when
i
heard
him
next
no
he
burst
out
your
refuge
is
not
in
books
and
not
in
the
barren
religious
forms
which
call
themselves
protestant
dear
master
the
peace
of
mind
which
you
believe
you
have
lost
forever
you
will
find
again
in
the
divine
wisdom
and
compassion
of
the
holy
catholic
church
there
is
the
remedy
for
all
that
you
suffer
there
is
the
new
life
that
will
yet
make
you
a
happy
man
i
repeat
what
he
said
so
far
merely
to
satisfy
you
that
we
can
trust
his
enthusiasm
when
it
is
once
roused
nothing
will
discourage
nothing
will
defeat
him
now
he
spoke
with
all
the
eloquence
of
conviction
using
the
necessary
arguments
with
a
force
and
feeling
which
i
have
rarely
heard
equaled
romayne
s
silence
vouched
for
the
effect
on
him
he
is
not
the
man
to
listen
patiently
to
reasoning
which
he
thinks
he
can
overthrow
having
heard
enough
to
satisfy
me
that
penrose
had
really
begun
the
good
work
i
quietly
slipped
out
of
the
and
left
the
hotel
being
sunday
i
shall
not
lose
a
post
if
i
keep
my
letter
open
until
i
have
already
sent
a
note
to
penrose
asking
him
to
call
on
me
at
his
earliest
convenience
there
may
be
more
news
for
you
before
post
time
monday
there
more
news
penrose
has
just
left
me
his
first
proceeding
of
course
was
to
tell
me
what
i
had
already
discovered
for
myself
he
is
modest
as
usual
about
the
prospect
of
success
which
awaits
him
but
he
has
induced
romayne
to
suspend
his
historical
studies
for
a
few
days
and
to
devote
his
attention
to
the
books
which
we
are
accustomed
to
recommend
for
perusal
in
such
cases
as
his
this
is
unquestionably
a
great
gain
at
starting
but
my
news
is
not
at
an
end
yet
romayne
is
actually
playing
our
game
he
has
resolved
definitely
to
withdraw
himself
from
the
influence
of
miss
eyrecourt
in
another
hour
he
and
penrose
will
have
left
london
their
destination
is
kept
a
profound
secret
all
letters
addressed
to
romayne
are
to
be
sent
to
his
bankers
the
motive
for
this
sudden
resolution
is
directly
traceable
to
lady
loring
her
ladyship
called
at
the
hotel
yesterday
evening
and
had
a
private
interview
with
romayne
her
object
no
doubt
was
to
shake
his
resolution
and
to
make
him
submit
himself
again
to
miss
eyrecourt
s
fascinations
what
means
of
persuasion
she
used
to
effect
this
purpose
is
of
course
unknown
to
us
penrose
saw
romayne
after
her
ladyship
s
departure
and
describes
him
as
violently
agitated
i
can
quite
understand
it
his
resolution
to
take
refuge
in
secret
flight
it
is
really
nothing
less
speaks
for
itself
as
to
the
impression
produced
on
him
and
the
danger
from
which
for
the
time
at
least
we
have
escaped
yes
i
say
for
the
time
at
don
t
let
our
reverend
fathers
suppose
that
the
money
expended
on
my
private
inquiries
has
been
money
thrown
away
where
these
miserable
love
affairs
are
concerned
women
are
daunted
by
no
adverse
circumstances
and
warned
by
no
defeat
romayne
has
left
london
in
dread
of
his
own
weakness
we
must
not
forget
that
the
day
may
yet
come
when
nothing
will
interpose
between
us
and
failure
but
my
knowledge
of
events
in
miss
eyrecourt
s
life
for
the
present
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
chapter

asked
eagerly
if
he
had
heard
any
news
of
romayne
lord
loring
shook
his
head
as
i
told
you
yesterday
he
said
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
can
give
me
no
information
i
went
myself
this
morning
to
the
bankers
and
saw
the
head
partner
he
offered
to
forward
letters
but
he
could
do
no
more
until
further
notice
he
was
positively
enjoined
not
to
disclose
romayne
s
address
to
anybody
how
does
stella
bear
it
in
the
worst
possible
way
lady
loring
answered
in
not
a
word
even
to
you
not
a
at
that
reply
the
servant
interrupted
them
by
announcing
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
and
presenting
his
card
lord
loring
started
and
handed
it
to
his
wife
the
card
bore
the
name
of
major
hynd
and
this
line
was
added
in
pencil
on
business
connected
with
show
him
in
directly
cried
lady
loring
lord
loring
remonstrated
my
dear
perhaps
i
had
better
see
this
gentleman
alone
certainly
not
unless
you
wish
to
drive
me
into
committing
an
act
of
the
most
revolting
meanness
if
you
send
me
away
i
shall
listen
at
the
major
hynd
was
shown
in
and
was
duly
presented
to
lady
loring
after
making
the
customary
apologies
he
said
i
returned
to
london
last
night
expressly
to
see
romayne
on
a
matter
of
importance
failing
to
discover
his
present
address
at
the
hotel
i
had
the
hope
that
your
lordship
might
be
able
to
direct
me
to
our
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
lord
loring
replied
romayne
s
present
address
is
a
secret
confided
to
his
bankers
and
to
no
one
else
i
will
give
you
their
names
if
you
wish
to
write
to
major
hynd
hesitated
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
it
would
be
discreet
to
write
to
him
under
the
lady
loring
could
no
longer
keep
silence
is
it
possible
major
hynd
to
tell
us
what
the
circumstances
are
she
asked
i
am
almost
as
old
a
friend
of
romayne
as
my
husband
and
i
am
very
anxious
about
the
major
looked
embarrassed
i
can
hardly
answer
your
ladyship
he
said
without
reviving
painful
recollections
lady
loring
s
impatience
interrupted
the
major
s
apologies
do
you
mean
the
duel
she
inquired
lord
loring
interposed
i
should
tell
you
major
hynd
that
lady
loring
is
as
well
informed
as
i
am
of
what
happened
at
boulogne
and
of
the
deplorable
result
so
far
as
romayne
is
concerned
if
you
still
wish
to
speak
to
me
privately
i
will
ask
you
to
accompany
me
into
the
next
major
hynd
s
embarrassment
vanished
after
what
you
tell
me
he
said
i
hope
to
be
favored
with
lady
loring
s
advice
you
both
know
that
romayne
fought
the
fatal
duel
with
a
son
of
the
french
general
who
had
challenged
him
when
we
returned
to
england
we
heard
that
the
general
and
his
family
had
been
driven
away
from
boulogne
by
pecuniary
difficulties
romayne
against
my
advice
wrote
to
the
surgeon
who
had
been
present
at
the
duel
desiring
that
the
general
s
place
of
retreat
might
be
discovered
and
expressing
his
wish
to
assist
the
family
anonymously
as
their
unknown
friend
the
motive
of
course
was
in
his
own
words
to
make
some
little
atonement
to
the
poor
people
whom
he
had
i
thought
it
a
rash
proceeding
at
the
time
and
i
am
confirmed
in
my
opinion
by
a
letter
from
the
surgeon
received
yesterday
will
you
kindly
read
it
to
lady
loring
he
handed
the
letter
to
lord
loring
translated
from
the
french
it
ran
as
follows
sir
i
am
at
last
able
to
answer
romayne
s
letter
definitely
with
the
courteous
assistance
of
the
french
consul
in
london
to
whom
i
applied
when
other
means
of
investigation
had
produced
no
result
a
week
since
the
general
died
circumstances
connected
with
the
burial
expenses
informed
the
consul
that
he
had
taken
refuge
from
his
creditors
not
in
paris
as
we
supposed
but
in
london
the
address
is
number
camp
s
hill
islington
i
should
also
add
that
the
general
for
obvious
reasons
lived
in
london
under
the
assumed
name
of
marillac
it
will
be
necessary
therefore
to
inquire
for
his
widow
by
the
name
of
madame
marillac
you
will
perhaps
be
surprised
to
find
that
i
address
these
lines
to
you
instead
of
to
romayne
the
reason
is
soon
told
i
was
acquainted
with
the
late
general
as
you
know
at
a
time
when
i
was
not
aware
of
the
company
that
he
kept
or
of
the
deplorable
errors
into
which
his
love
of
gambling
had
betrayed
him
of
his
widow
and
his
children
i
know
absolutely
nothing
whether
they
have
resisted
the
contaminating
influence
of
the
head
of
the
household
or
whether
poverty
and
bad
example
combined
have
hopelessly
degraded
them
i
can
not
say
there
is
at
least
a
doubt
whether
they
are
worthy
of
romayne
s
benevolent
intentions
toward
them
as
an
honest
man
i
can
not
feel
this
doubt
and
reconcile
it
to
my
conscience
to
be
the
means
however
indirectly
of
introducing
them
to
romayne
to
your
discretion
i
leave
it
to
act
for
the
best
after
this
lord
loring
returned
the
letter
to
major
hynd
i
agree
with
you
he
said
it
is
more
than
doubtful
whether
you
ought
to
communicate
this
information
to
lady
loring
was
not
quite
of
her
husband
s
opinion
while
there
is
a
doubt
about
these
people
she
said
it
seems
only
just
to
find
out
what
sort
of
character
they
bear
in
the
neighborhood
in
your
place
major
hynd
i
should
apply
to
the
person
in
whose
house
they
live
or
to
the
tradespeople
whom
they
have
i
am
obliged
to
leave
london
again
the
major
replied
but
on
my
return
i
will
certainly
follow
your
ladyship
s
and
you
will
let
us
know
the
result
with
the
greatest
major
hynd
took
his
leave
i
think
you
will
be
responsible
for
wasting
the
major
s
time
said
lord
loring
when
the
visitor
had
retired
i
think
not
said
lady
loring
she
rose
to
leave
the
room
are
you
going
out
her
husband
asked
no
i
am
going
upstairs
to
lady
loring
found
miss
eyrecourt
in
her
own
room
the
little
portrait
of
romayne
which
she
had
drawn
from
recollection
lay
on
the
table
before
her
she
was
examining
it
with
the
closest
attention
well
stella
and
what
does
the
portrait
tell
you
what
i
knew
before
adelaide
there
is
nothing
false
and
nothing
cruel
in
that
and
does
the
discovery
satisfy
you
for
my
part
i
despise
romayne
for
hiding
himself
from
us
can
you
excuse
him
stella
locked
up
the
portrait
in
her
i
can
wait
she
said
quietly
this
assertion
of
patience
seemed
to
irritate
lady
loring
what
is
the
matter
with
you
this
morning
she
asked
you
are
more
reserved
than
no
i
am
only
out
of
spirits
adelaide
i
can
t
help
thinking
of
that
meeting
with
winterfield
i
feel
as
if
some
misfortune
was
hanging
over
my
don
t
speak
of
that
hateful
man
her
ladyship
exclaimed
i
have
something
to
tell
you
about
romayne
are
you
completely
absorbed
in
your
presentiments
of
evil
or
do
you
think
you
can
listen
to
me
stella
s
face
answered
for
her
lady
loring
described
the
interview
with
major
hynd
in
the
minutest
detail
including
by
way
of
illustration
the
major
s
manners
and
personal
appearance
he
and
lord
loring
she
added
both
think
that
romayne
will
never
hear
the
last
of
it
if
he
allows
these
foreigners
to
look
to
him
for
money
until
something
more
is
known
about
them
the
letter
is
not
to
be
i
wish
i
had
the
letter
cried
stella
would
you
forward
it
to
romayne
instantly
does
it
matter
whether
these
poor
french
people
are
worthy
of
his
generosity
if
it
restores
his
tranquillity
to
help
them
who
cares
whether
they
deserve
the
help
they
are
not
even
to
know
who
it
is
that
assists
them
romayne
is
to
be
their
unknown
friend
it
is
he
not
they
whom
we
have
to
think
of
his
peace
of
mind
is
everything
their
merit
is
nothing
i
say
it
s
cruel
to
to
keep
him
in
ignorance
of
what
has
happened
why
didn
t
you
take
the
letter
away
from
major
hynd
gently
stella
the
major
is
going
to
make
inquiries
about
the
widow
and
children
when
he
returns
to
when
he
returns
stella
repeated
indignantly
who
knows
what
the
poor
wretches
may
be
suffering
in
the
interval
and
what
romayne
may
feel
if
he
ever
hears
of
it
tell
me
the
address
again
it
was
somewhere
in
islington
you
why
do
you
want
to
know
it
lady
loring
asked
you
are
not
going
to
write
to
romayne
yourself
i
am
going
to
think
before
i
do
anything
if
you
can
t
trust
my
discretion
adelaide
you
have
only
to
say
so
it
was
spoken
sharply
lady
loring
s
reply
betrayed
a
certain
loss
of
temper
on
her
side
manage
your
own
affairs
stella
i
have
done
meddling
with
her
unlucky
visit
to
romayne
at
the
hotel
had
been
a
subject
of
dispute
between
the
two
friends
and
this
referred
to
it
you
shall
have
the
address
my
lady
added
in
her
grandest
manner
she
wrote
it
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
left
the
room
easily
irritated
lady
loring
had
the
merit
of
being
easily
appeased
that
meanest
of
all
vices
the
vice
of
sulkiness
had
no
existence
in
her
nature
in
five
minutes
she
regretted
her
little
outburst
of
irritability
for
five
minutes
more
she
waited
on
the
chance
that
stella
might
be
the
first
to
seek
a
reconciliation
the
interval
passed
and
nothing
happened
have
i
really
offended
her
lady
loring
asked
herself
the
next
moment
she
was
on
her
way
back
to
stella
the
room
was
empty
she
rang
the
bell
for
the
maid
where
is
miss
eyrecourt
gone
out
my
did
she
leave
no
message
no
my
lady
she
went
away
in
a
great
lady
loring
at
once
drew
the
conclusion
that
stella
had
rashly
taken
the
affair
of
the
general
s
family
into
her
own
hands
was
it
possible
to
say
how
this
most
imprudent
proceeding
might
end
after
hesitating
and
reflecting
and
hesitating
again
lady
loring
s
anxiety
got
beyond
her
control
she
not
only
decided
on
following
stella
but
in
the
excess
of
her
nervous
apprehension
she
took
one
of
the
with
her
in
case
of
emergency
chapter
xii
the
general
s
family
not
always
remarkable
for
arriving
at
just
conclusions
lady
loring
had
drawn
the
right
inference
this
time
stella
had
stopped
the
first
cab
that
passed
her
and
had
directed
the
driver
to
camp
s
hill
islington
the
aspect
of
the
miserable
little
street
closed
at
one
end
and
swarming
with
dirty
children
quarreling
over
their
play
daunted
her
for
the
moment
even
the
cabman
drawing
up
at
the
entrance
to
the
street
expressed
his
opinion
that
it
was
a
queer
sort
of
place
for
a
young
lady
to
venture
into
alone
stella
thought
of
romayne
her
firm
persuasion
that
she
was
helping
him
to
perform
an
act
of
mercy
which
was
to
his
mind
an
act
of
atonement
as
well
roused
her
courage
she
boldly
approached
the
open
door
of
no
and
knocked
on
it
with
her
parasol
the
tangled
gray
hair
and
grimy
face
of
a
hideous
old
woman
showed
themselves
slowly
at
the
end
of
the
passage
rising
from
the
obscurity
of
the
kitchen
regions
what
do
you
want
said
the
witch
of
the
london
slums
does
madame
marillac
live
here
stella
asked
do
you
mean
the
foreigner
second
with
those
instructions
the
upper
half
of
the
witch
sank
and
vanished
stella
gathered
her
skirts
together
and
ascended
a
filthy
flight
of
stairs
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
coarse
voices
shameless
language
gross
laughter
behind
the
closed
doors
of
the
first
floor
hurried
her
on
her
way
to
the
rooms
on
the
higher
flight
here
there
was
a
change
for
the
better
here
at
least
there
was
silence
she
knocked
at
the
door
on
the
landing
of
the
second
floor
a
gentle
voice
answered
in
french
entrez
then
quickly
substituted
the
english
equivalent
come
in
stella
opened
the
door
the
wretchedly
furnished
room
was
scrupulously
clean
above
the
a
cheap
little
image
of
the
virgin
was
fastened
to
the
wall
with
some
faded
artificial
flowers
arranged
above
it
in
the
form
of
a
wreath
two
women
in
dresses
of
coarse
black
stuff
sat
at
a
small
round
table
working
at
the
same
piece
of
embroidery
the
elder
of
the
two
rose
when
the
visitor
entered
the
room
her
worn
and
weary
face
still
showed
the
remains
of
beauty
in
its
finely
proportioned
parts
her
dim
eyes
rested
on
stella
with
an
expression
of
piteous
entreaty
have
you
come
for
the
work
madam
she
asked
in
english
spoken
with
a
strong
foreign
accent
pray
forgive
me
i
have
not
finished
it
the
second
of
the
two
workwomen
suddenly
looked
up
she
too
was
wan
and
frail
but
her
eyes
were
bright
her
movements
still
preserved
the
elasticity
of
youth
her
likeness
to
the
elder
woman
proclaimed
their
relationship
even
before
she
spoke
ah
it
s
my
fault
she
burst
out
passionately
in
french
i
was
hungry
and
tired
and
i
slept
hours
longer
than
i
ought
my
mother
was
too
kind
to
wake
me
and
set
me
to
work
i
am
a
selfish
wretch
and
my
mother
is
an
angel
she
dashed
away
the
tears
gathering
in
her
eyes
and
proudly
fiercely
resumed
her
work
stella
hastened
to
reassure
them
the
moment
she
could
make
herself
heard
indeed
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
work
she
said
speaking
in
french
so
that
they
might
the
more
readily
understand
her
i
came
here
madame
marillac
if
you
will
not
be
offended
with
me
for
plainly
owning
it
to
offer
you
some
little
charity
asked
the
daughter
looking
up
again
sternly
from
her
needle
sympathy
stella
answered
gently
the
girl
resumed
her
work
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
i
shall
learn
to
submit
to
my
lot
in
the
quiet
mother
placed
a
chair
for
stella
you
have
a
kind
beautiful
face
miss
she
said
and
i
am
sure
you
will
make
allowances
for
my
poor
girl
i
remember
the
time
when
i
was
as
quick
to
feel
as
she
is
may
i
ask
how
you
came
to
hear
of
us
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
stella
replied
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
answer
that
the
mother
said
nothing
the
daughter
asked
sharply
why
not
stella
addressed
her
answer
to
the
mother
i
come
from
a
person
who
desires
to
be
of
service
to
you
as
an
unknown
friend
she
said
the
wan
face
of
the
widow
suddenly
brightened
oh
she
exclaimed
has
my
brother
heard
of
the
general
s
death
and
has
he
forgiven
me
my
marriage
at
last
no
no
stella
interposed
i
must
not
mislead
you
the
person
whom
i
represent
is
no
relation
of
even
in
spite
of
this
positive
assertion
the
poor
woman
held
desperately
to
the
hope
that
had
been
roused
in
her
the
name
by
which
you
know
me
may
mislead
you
she
suggested
anxiously
my
late
husband
assumed
the
name
in
his
exile
here
perhaps
if
i
told
you
the
daughter
stopped
her
there
my
dear
mother
leave
this
to
the
widow
sighed
resignedly
and
resumed
her
work
madame
marillac
will
do
very
well
as
a
name
the
girl
continued
turning
to
stella
until
we
know
something
more
of
each
other
i
suppose
you
are
well
acquainted
with
the
person
whom
you
represent
certainly
or
i
should
not
be
you
know
the
person
s
family
connections
in
that
case
and
you
can
say
for
certain
whether
they
are
french
connections
or
not
i
can
say
for
certain
stella
answered
that
they
are
english
connections
i
represent
a
friend
who
feels
kindly
toward
madame
marillac
nothing
you
see
mother
you
were
mistaken
bear
it
as
bravely
dear
as
you
have
borne
other
saying
this
very
tenderly
she
addressed
herself
once
more
to
stella
without
attempting
to
conceal
the
accompanying
change
in
her
manner
to
coldness
and
distrust
one
of
us
must
speak
plainly
she
said
our
few
friends
are
nearly
as
poor
as
we
are
and
they
are
all
french
i
tell
you
positively
that
we
have
no
english
friends
how
has
this
anonymous
benefactor
been
informed
of
our
poverty
you
are
a
stranger
to
us
can
not
have
given
the
information
stella
s
eyes
were
now
open
to
the
awkward
position
in
which
she
had
placed
herself
she
met
the
difficulty
boldly
still
upheld
by
the
conviction
that
she
was
serving
a
purpose
cherished
by
romayne
you
had
good
reasons
no
doubt
mademoiselle
when
you
advised
your
mother
to
conceal
her
true
name
she
rejoined
be
just
enough
to
believe
that
your
anonymous
benefactor
has
good
reasons
for
concealment
it
was
well
said
and
it
encouraged
madame
marillac
to
take
stella
s
part
my
dear
blanche
you
speak
rather
harshly
to
this
good
young
lady
she
said
to
her
daughter
you
have
only
to
look
at
her
and
to
see
that
she
means
blanche
took
up
her
needle
again
with
dogged
submission
if
we
to
accept
charity
mother
i
should
like
to
know
the
hand
that
gives
it
she
answered
i
will
say
no
when
you
are
as
old
as
i
am
my
dear
rejoined
madame
marillac
you
will
not
think
quite
so
positively
as
you
think
now
i
have
learned
some
hard
lessons
she
proceeded
turning
to
stella
and
i
hope
i
am
the
better
for
them
my
life
has
not
been
a
happy
one
your
life
has
been
a
martyrdom
said
the
girl
breaking
out
again
in
spite
of
herself
oh
my
father
my
father
she
pushed
aside
the
work
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
the
gentle
mother
spoke
severely
for
the
first
time
respect
your
father
s
memory
she
said
blanche
trembled
and
kept
silence
i
have
no
false
pride
madame
marillac
continued
i
own
that
we
are
miserably
poor
and
i
thank
you
my
dear
young
lady
for
your
kind
intentions
toward
us
without
embarrassing
you
by
any
inquiries
we
manage
to
live
while
my
eyes
last
our
work
helps
to
support
us
my
good
eldest
daughter
has
some
employment
as
a
teacher
of
music
and
contributes
her
little
share
to
assist
our
poor
household
i
don
t
distrust
you
i
only
say
let
us
try
a
little
longer
if
we
can
not
help
she
had
barely
pronounced
the
last
words
when
a
startling
interruption
led
to
consequences
which
the
persons
present
had
not
foreseen
a
shrill
wailing
voice
suddenly
pierced
through
the
flimsy
partition
which
divided
the
front
room
and
the
back
room
bread
cried
the
voice
in
french
i
m
hungry
bread
bread
the
daughter
started
to
her
feet
think
of
his
betraying
us
at
this
moment
she
exclaimed
indignantly
the
mother
rose
in
silence
and
opened
a
cupboard
its
position
was
opposite
to
the
place
in
which
stella
was
sitting
she
saw
two
or
three
knives
and
forks
some
cups
and
saucers
and
plates
and
a
folded
nothing
else
appeared
on
the
shelves
not
even
the
stray
crust
of
bread
for
which
the
poor
woman
had
been
looking
go
my
dear
and
quiet
your
brother
she
said
and
closed
the
cupboard
door
again
as
patiently
as
ever
stella
opened
her
pocketbook
when
blanche
had
left
the
room
for
god
s
sake
take
something
she
cried
i
offer
it
with
the
sincerest
respect
i
offer
it
as
a
madame
marillac
gently
signed
to
stella
to
close
the
pocketbook
again
that
kind
heart
of
yours
must
not
be
distressed
about
trifles
she
said
the
baker
will
trust
us
until
we
get
the
money
for
our
work
and
my
daughter
knows
it
if
you
can
tell
me
nothing
else
my
dear
will
you
tell
me
your
christian
name
it
is
painful
to
me
to
speak
to
you
quite
as
a
stella
at
once
complied
with
the
request
madame
marillac
smiled
as
she
repeated
the
name
there
is
almost
another
tie
between
us
she
said
we
have
your
name
in
france
it
speaks
with
a
familiar
sound
to
me
in
this
strange
place
dear
miss
stella
when
my
poor
boy
startled
you
by
that
cry
for
food
he
recalled
to
me
the
saddest
of
all
my
anxieties
when
i
think
of
him
i
should
be
tempted
if
my
better
sense
did
not
restrain
me
no
no
put
back
the
pocketbook
i
am
incapable
of
the
shameless
audacity
of
borrowing
a
sum
of
money
which
i
could
never
repay
let
me
tell
you
what
my
trouble
is
and
you
will
understand
that
i
am
in
earnest
i
had
two
sons
miss
stella
the
elder
the
most
lovable
the
most
affectionate
of
my
children
was
killed
in
a
the
sudden
disclosure
drew
a
cry
of
sympathy
from
stella
which
she
was
not
mistress
enough
of
herself
to
repress
now
for
the
first
time
she
understood
the
remorse
that
tortured
romayne
as
she
had
not
understood
it
when
lady
loring
had
told
her
the
terrible
story
of
the
duel
attributing
the
effect
produced
on
her
to
the
sensitive
nature
of
a
young
woman
madame
marillac
innocently
added
to
stella
s
distress
by
making
excuses
i
am
sorry
to
have
frightened
you
my
dear
she
said
in
your
happy
country
such
a
dreadful
death
as
my
son
s
is
unknown
i
am
obliged
to
mention
it
or
you
might
not
understand
what
i
have
still
to
say
perhaps
i
had
better
not
go
on
stella
roused
herself
yes
yes
she
answered
eagerly
pray
go
on
my
son
in
the
next
room
the
widow
resumed
is
only
fourteen
years
old
it
has
pleased
god
sorely
to
afflict
a
harmless
creature
he
has
not
been
in
his
right
mind
since
since
the
miserable
day
when
he
followed
the
duelists
and
saw
his
brother
s
death
oh
you
are
turning
pale
how
thoughtless
how
cruel
of
me
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
such
horrors
as
these
have
never
overshadowed
your
happy
life
struggling
to
recover
her
stella
tried
to
reassure
madame
marillac
by
a
gesture
the
voice
which
she
had
heard
in
the
next
room
was
as
she
now
knew
the
voice
that
haunted
romayne
not
the
words
that
had
pleaded
hunger
and
called
for
bread
but
those
other
words
assassin
assassin
where
are
you
rang
in
her
ears
she
entreated
madame
marillac
to
break
the
unendurable
interval
of
silence
the
widow
s
calm
voice
had
a
soothing
influence
which
she
was
eager
to
feel
go
on
she
repeated
pray
go
on
i
ought
not
to
lay
all
the
blame
of
my
boy
s
affliction
on
the
duel
said
madame
marillac
in
childhood
his
mind
never
grew
with
his
bodily
growth
his
brother
s
death
may
have
only
hurried
the
result
which
was
sooner
or
later
but
too
sure
to
come
you
need
feel
no
fear
of
him
he
is
never
violent
and
he
is
the
most
beautiful
of
my
children
would
you
like
to
see
him
no
i
would
rather
hear
you
speak
of
him
is
he
not
conscious
of
his
own
misfortune
for
weeks
together
stella
i
am
sure
i
may
call
you
stella
he
is
quite
calm
you
would
see
no
difference
outwardly
between
him
and
other
boys
unhappily
it
is
just
at
those
times
that
a
spirit
of
impatience
seems
to
possess
him
he
watches
his
opportunity
and
however
careful
we
may
be
he
is
cunning
enough
to
escape
our
do
you
mean
that
he
leaves
you
and
his
sisters
yes
that
is
what
i
mean
for
nearly
two
months
past
he
has
been
away
from
us
yesterday
only
his
return
relieved
us
from
a
state
of
suspense
which
i
can
not
attempt
to
describe
we
don
t
know
where
he
has
been
or
in
the
company
of
what
persons
he
has
passed
the
time
of
his
absense
no
persuasion
will
induce
him
to
speak
to
us
on
the
subject
this
morning
we
listened
while
he
was
talking
to
was
it
part
of
the
boy
s
madness
to
repeat
the
words
which
still
tormented
romayne
stella
asked
if
he
ever
spoke
of
the
duel
never
he
seems
to
have
lost
all
memory
of
it
we
only
heard
this
morning
one
or
two
unconnected
words
something
about
a
woman
and
then
more
that
appeared
to
allude
to
some
person
s
death
last
night
i
was
with
him
when
he
went
to
bed
and
i
found
that
he
had
something
to
conceal
from
me
he
let
me
fold
all
his
clothes
as
usual
except
his
waistcoat
and
that
he
snatched
away
from
me
and
put
it
under
his
pillow
we
have
no
hope
of
being
able
to
examine
the
waistcoat
without
his
knowledge
his
sleep
is
like
the
sleep
of
a
dog
if
you
only
approach
him
he
wakes
instantly
forgive
me
for
troubling
you
with
these
trifling
details
only
interesting
to
ourselves
you
will
at
least
understand
the
constant
anxiety
that
we
in
your
unhappy
position
said
stella
i
should
try
to
resign
myself
to
parting
with
him
i
mean
to
placing
him
under
medical
the
mother
s
face
saddened
i
have
inquired
about
it
she
answered
he
must
pass
a
night
in
the
workhouse
before
he
can
be
received
as
a
pauper
lunatic
in
a
public
asylum
oh
my
dear
i
am
afraid
there
is
some
pride
still
left
in
me
he
is
my
only
son
now
his
father
was
a
general
in
the
french
army
i
was
brought
up
among
people
of
good
blood
and
breeding
i
can
t
take
my
own
boy
to
the
workhouse
stella
understood
her
i
feel
for
you
with
all
my
heart
she
said
place
him
privately
dear
madame
marillac
under
skillful
and
kind
control
and
let
me
do
let
me
open
the
pocketbook
the
widow
steadily
refused
even
to
look
at
the
pocketbook
perhaps
stella
persisted
you
don
t
know
of
a
private
asylum
that
would
satisfy
you
my
dear
i
do
know
of
such
a
place
the
good
doctor
who
attended
my
husband
in
his
last
illness
told
me
of
it
a
friend
of
his
receives
a
certain
number
of
poor
people
into
his
house
and
charges
no
more
than
the
cost
of
maintaining
them
an
unattainable
sum
to
there
is
the
temptation
that
i
spoke
of
the
help
of
a
few
pounds
i
might
accept
if
i
fell
ill
because
i
might
afterward
pay
it
back
but
a
larger
sum
never
she
rose
as
if
to
end
the
interview
stella
tried
every
means
of
persuasion
that
she
could
think
of
and
tried
in
vain
the
friendly
dispute
between
them
might
have
been
prolonged
if
they
had
not
both
been
silenced
by
another
interruption
from
the
next
room
this
time
it
was
not
only
endurable
it
was
even
welcome
the
poor
boy
was
playing
the
air
of
a
french
vaudeville
on
a
pipe
or
flageolet
now
he
is
happy
said
the
mother
he
is
a
born
musician
do
come
and
see
him
an
idea
struck
stella
she
overcame
the
inveterate
reluctance
in
her
to
see
the
boy
so
fatally
associated
with
the
misery
of
romayne
s
life
as
madame
marillac
led
the
way
to
the
door
of
communication
between
the
rooms
she
quickly
took
from
her
pocketbook
the
with
which
she
had
provided
herself
and
folded
them
so
that
they
could
be
easily
concealed
in
her
hand
she
followed
the
widow
into
the
little
room
the
boy
was
sitting
on
his
bed
he
laid
down
his
flageolet
and
bowed
to
stella
his
long
silky
hair
flowed
to
his
shoulders
but
one
betrayal
of
a
deranged
mind
presented
itself
in
his
delicate
face
his
large
soft
eyes
had
the
glassy
vacant
look
which
it
is
impossible
to
mistake
do
you
like
music
mademoiselle
he
asked
gently
stella
asked
him
to
play
his
little
vaudeville
air
again
he
proudly
complied
with
the
request
his
sister
seemed
to
resent
the
presence
of
a
stranger
the
work
is
at
a
standstill
she
said
and
passed
into
the
front
room
her
mother
followed
her
as
far
as
the
door
to
give
her
some
necessary
directions
stella
seized
her
opportunity
she
put
the
into
the
pocket
of
the
boy
s
jacket
and
whispered
to
him
give
them
to
your
mother
when
i
have
gone
under
those
circumstances
she
felt
sure
that
madame
marillac
would
yield
to
the
temptation
she
could
resist
much
but
she
could
not
resist
her
son
the
boy
nodded
to
show
that
he
understood
her
the
moment
after
he
laid
down
his
flageolet
with
an
expression
of
surprise
you
are
trembling
he
said
are
you
frightened
she
frightened
the
mere
sense
of
touching
him
had
made
her
shudder
did
she
feel
a
vague
presentiment
of
some
evil
to
come
from
that
momentary
association
with
him
madame
marillac
turning
away
again
from
her
daughter
noticed
stella
s
agitation
surely
my
poor
boy
doesn
t
alarm
you
she
said
before
stella
could
answer
some
one
outside
knocked
at
the
door
lady
loring
s
servant
appeared
charged
with
a
message
if
you
please
miss
a
friend
is
waiting
for
you
any
excuse
for
departure
was
welcome
to
stella
at
that
moment
she
promised
to
call
at
the
house
again
in
a
few
days
madame
marillac
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
as
she
took
leave
her
nerves
were
still
shaken
by
that
momentary
contact
with
the
boy
descending
the
stairs
she
trembled
so
that
she
was
obliged
to
hold
by
the
servant
s
arm
she
was
not
naturally
timid
what
did
it
mean
lady
loring
s
carriage
was
waiting
at
the
entrance
of
the
street
with
all
the
children
in
the
neighborhood
assembled
to
admire
it
she
impulsively
forestalled
the
servant
in
opening
the
carriage
door
come
in
she
cried
oh
stella
you
don
t
know
how
you
have
frightened
me
good
heavens
you
look
frightened
yourself
from
what
wretches
have
i
rescued
you
take
my
smelling
bottle
and
tell
me
all
about
the
fresh
air
and
the
reassuring
presence
of
her
old
friend
revived
stella
she
was
able
to
describe
her
interview
with
the
general
s
family
and
to
answer
the
inevitable
inquiries
which
the
narrative
called
forth
lady
loring
s
last
question
was
the
most
important
of
the
series
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
romayne
i
am
going
to
write
to
him
the
moment
we
get
the
answer
seemed
to
alarm
lady
loring
you
won
t
betray
me
she
said
what
do
you
mean
you
won
t
let
romayne
discover
that
i
have
told
you
about
the
duel
certainly
not
you
shall
see
my
letter
before
i
send
it
to
be
tranquilized
so
far
lady
loring
bethought
herself
next
of
major
hynd
can
we
tell
him
what
you
have
done
her
ladyship
asked
of
course
we
can
tell
him
stella
replied
i
shall
conceal
nothing
from
lord
loring
and
i
shall
beg
your
good
husband
to
write
to
the
major
he
need
only
say
that
i
have
made
the
necessary
inquiries
after
being
informed
of
the
circumstances
by
you
and
that
i
have
communicated
the
favorable
result
to
it
s
easy
enough
to
write
the
letter
my
dear
but
it
s
not
so
easy
to
say
what
major
hynd
may
think
of
does
it
matter
to
me
what
major
hynd
thinks
lady
loring
looked
at
stella
with
a
malicious
smile
are
you
equally
indifferent
she
said
to
what
romayne
s
opinion
of
your
conduct
may
be
stella
s
color
rose
try
to
be
serious
adelaide
when
you
speak
to
me
of
romayne
she
answered
gravely
his
good
opinion
of
me
is
the
breath
of
my
an
hour
later
the
important
letter
to
romayne
was
written
stella
scrupulously
informed
him
of
all
that
had
happened
with
two
necessary
omissions
in
the
first
place
nothing
was
said
of
the
widow
s
reference
to
her
son
s
death
and
of
the
effect
produced
by
it
on
his
younger
brother
the
boy
was
simply
described
as
being
of
weak
intellect
and
as
requiring
to
be
kept
under
competent
control
in
the
second
place
romayne
was
left
to
infer
that
ordinary
motives
of
benevolence
were
the
only
motives
on
his
part
known
to
miss
eyrecourt
the
letter
ended
in
these
lines
if
i
have
taken
an
undue
liberty
in
venturing
unasked
to
appear
as
your
representative
i
can
only
plead
that
i
meant
well
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
hard
on
these
poor
people
and
not
just
to
you
in
your
absence
to
interpose
any
needless
delays
in
carrying
out
those
kind
intentions
of
yours
which
had
no
doubt
been
properly
considered
beforehand
in
forming
your
opinion
of
my
conduct
pray
remember
that
i
have
been
careful
not
to
compromise
you
in
any
way
you
are
only
known
to
madame
marillac
as
a
compassionate
person
who
offers
to
help
her
and
who
wishes
to
give
that
help
anonymously
if
notwithstanding
this
you
disapprove
of
what
i
have
done
i
must
not
conceal
that
it
will
grieve
and
humiliate
me
i
have
been
so
eager
to
be
of
use
to
you
when
others
appeared
to
hesitate
i
must
find
my
consolation
in
remembering
that
i
have
become
acquainted
with
one
of
the
sweetest
and
noblest
of
women
and
that
i
have
helped
to
preserve
her
afflicted
son
from
dangers
in
the
future
which
i
can
not
presume
to
estimate
you
will
complete
what
i
have
only
begun
be
forbearing
and
kind
to
me
if
i
have
innocently
offended
in
this
matter
and
i
shall
gratefully
remember
the
day
when
i
took
it
on
myself
to
be
romayne
s
lady
loring
read
these
concluding
sentences
twice
over
i
think
the
end
of
your
letter
will
have
its
effect
on
him
she
said
if
it
brings
me
a
kind
letter
in
reply
stella
answered
it
will
have
all
the
effect
i
hope
if
it
does
anything
lady
loring
rejoined
it
will
do
more
than
what
more
can
it
do
my
dear
it
can
bring
romayne
back
to
those
hopeful
words
seemed
rather
to
startle
stella
than
to
encourage
her
bring
him
back
to
me
she
repeated
oh
adelaide
i
wish
i
could
think
as
you
do
send
the
letter
to
the
post
said
lady
loring

father
benwell
s
correspondence
i
penrose
to
father
reverend
and
dear
father
when
i
last
had
the
honor
of
seeing
you
i
received
your
instructions
to
report
by
letter
the
result
of
my
conversations
on
religion
with
romayne
as
events
have
turned
out
it
is
needless
to
occupy
your
time
by
dwelling
at
any
length
on
this
subject
in
writing
romayne
has
been
strongly
impressed
by
the
excellent
books
which
i
have
introduced
to
his
notice
he
raises
certain
objections
which
i
have
done
my
best
to
meet
and
he
promises
to
consider
my
arguments
with
his
closest
attention
in
the
time
to
come
i
am
happier
in
the
hope
of
restoring
his
mental
tranquillity
in
other
and
worthier
words
of
effecting
his
conversion
than
i
can
tell
you
in
any
words
of
mine
i
respect
and
admire
i
may
almost
say
i
love
romayne
the
details
which
are
wanting
in
this
brief
report
of
progress
i
shall
have
the
privilege
of
personally
relating
to
you
romayne
no
longer
desires
to
conceal
himself
from
his
friends
he
received
a
letter
this
morning
which
has
changed
all
his
plans
and
has
decided
him
on
immediately
returning
to
london
i
am
not
acquainted
with
the
contents
of
the
letter
or
with
the
name
of
the
writer
but
i
am
pleased
for
romayne
s
sake
to
see
that
the
reading
of
it
has
made
him
happy
by
evening
i
hope
to
present
my
respects
to
you
ii
bitrake
to
father
sir
the
inquiries
which
i
have
instituted
at
your
request
have
proved
successful
in
one
respect
i
am
in
a
position
to
tell
you
that
events
in
winterfield
s
life
have
unquestionably
connected
him
with
the
young
lady
named
miss
stella
eyrecourt
the
attendant
circumstances
however
are
not
so
easy
to
discover
judging
by
the
careful
report
of
the
person
whom
i
employ
there
must
have
been
serious
reasons
in
this
case
for
keeping
facts
secret
and
witnesses
out
of
the
way
i
mention
this
not
to
discourage
you
but
to
prepare
you
for
delays
that
may
occur
on
our
way
to
discovery
be
pleased
to
preserve
your
confidence
in
me
and
to
give
me
time
and
i
answer
for
the
result
book
the
second
chapter
i
the
sandwich
dance
a
fine
spring
after
a
winter
of
unusual
severity
promised
well
for
the
prospects
of
the
london
season
among
the
social
entertainments
of
the
time
general
curiosity
was
excited
in
the
little
sphere
which
absurdly
describes
itself
under
the
big
name
of
society
by
the
announcement
of
a
party
to
be
given
by
lady
loring
bearing
the
quaint
title
of
a
sandwich
dance
the
invitations
were
issued
at
an
unusually
early
hour
and
it
was
understood
that
nothing
so
solid
and
so
commonplace
as
the
customary
supper
was
to
be
offered
to
the
guests
in
a
word
lady
loring
s
ball
was
designed
as
a
bold
protest
against
late
hours
and
heavy
midnight
meals
the
younger
people
were
all
in
favor
of
the
proposed
reform
their
elders
declined
to
give
an
opinion
beforehand
in
the
small
inner
circle
of
lady
loring
s
most
intimate
friends
it
was
whispered
that
an
innovation
in
the
matter
of
refreshments
was
contemplated
which
would
put
the
tolerant
principles
of
the
guests
to
a
severe
test
miss
notman
the
housekeeper
politely
threatening
retirement
on
a
small
annuity
since
the
memorable
affair
of
the
decided
on
carrying
out
her
design
when
she
heard
that
there
was
to
be
no
supper
my
attachment
to
the
family
can
bear
a
great
deal
she
said
but
when
lady
loring
deliberately
gives
a
ball
without
a
supper
i
must
hide
my
head
somewhere
and
it
had
better
be
out
of
the
house
taking
miss
notman
as
representative
of
a
class
the
reception
of
the
coming
experiment
looked
to
say
the
least
of
it
doubtful
on
the
appointed
evening
the
guests
made
one
agreeable
discovery
when
they
entered
the
reception
rooms
they
were
left
perfectly
free
to
amuse
themselves
as
they
liked
the
were
given
up
to
dancing
the
picture
gallery
was
devoted
to
chamber
music
and
found
remote
and
quiet
rooms
especially
prepared
for
them
people
who
cared
for
nothing
but
talking
were
accommodated
to
perfection
in
a
sphere
of
their
own
and
lovers
in
earnest
or
not
in
earnest
discovered
in
a
conservatory
with
many
recesses
that
ideal
of
discreet
retirement
which
combines
solitude
and
society
under
one
roof
but
the
ordering
of
the
refreshments
failed
as
had
been
foreseen
to
share
in
the
approval
conferred
on
the
arrangement
of
the
rooms
the
first
impression
was
unfavorable
lady
loring
however
knew
enough
of
human
nature
to
leave
results
to
two
potent
allies
experience
and
time
excepting
the
conservatory
the
astonished
guests
could
go
nowhere
without
discovering
tables
prettily
decorated
with
flowers
and
bearing
hundreds
of
little
pure
white
china
plates
loaded
with
nothing
but
sandwiches
all
varieties
of
opinion
were
consulted
people
of
ordinary
tastes
who
liked
to
know
what
they
were
eating
could
choose
conventional
beef
or
ham
encased
in
thin
slices
of
bread
of
a
delicate
flavor
quite
new
to
them
other
persons
less
easily
pleased
were
tempted
by
sandwiches
of
de
fois
and
by
exquisite
combinations
of
chicken
and
truffles
reduced
to
a
creamy
pulp
which
clung
to
the
bread
like
butter
foreigners
making
experiments
and
not
averse
to
garlic
discovered
the
finest
sausages
of
germany
and
italy
transformed
into
english
sandwiches
anchovies
and
sardines
appealed
in
the
same
unexpected
way
to
men
who
desired
to
create
an
artificial
thirst
after
having
first
ascertained
that
the
champagne
was
something
to
be
fondly
remembered
and
regretted
at
other
parties
to
the
end
of
the
season
the
hospitable
profusion
of
the
refreshments
was
and
inexhaustible
wherever
the
guests
might
be
or
however
they
were
amusing
themselves
there
were
the
pretty
little
white
plates
perpetually
tempting
them
people
eat
as
they
had
never
eat
before
and
even
the
inveterate
english
prejudice
against
anything
new
was
conquered
at
last
universal
opinion
declared
the
sandwich
dance
to
be
an
admirable
idea
perfectly
carried
out
many
of
the
guests
paid
their
hostess
the
compliment
of
arriving
at
the
early
hour
mentioned
in
the
invitations
one
of
them
was
major
hynd
lady
loring
took
her
first
opportunity
of
speaking
to
him
apart
i
hear
you
were
a
little
angry
she
said
when
you
were
told
that
miss
eyrecourt
had
taken
your
inquiries
out
of
your
i
thought
it
rather
a
bold
proceeding
lady
loring
the
major
replied
but
as
the
general
s
widow
turned
out
to
be
a
lady
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
miss
eyrecourt
s
romantic
adventure
has
justified
itself
i
wouldn
t
recommend
her
to
run
the
same
risk
a
second
i
suppose
you
know
what
romayne
thinks
of
it
not
yet
i
have
been
too
busy
to
call
on
him
since
i
have
been
in
town
pardon
me
lady
loring
who
is
that
beautiful
creature
in
the
pale
yellow
dress
surely
i
have
seen
her
somewhere
before
that
beautiful
creature
major
is
the
bold
young
lady
of
whose
conduct
you
don
t
miss
eyrecourt
i
retract
everything
i
said
cried
the
major
quite
shamelessly
such
a
woman
as
that
may
do
anything
she
is
looking
this
way
pray
introduce
the
major
was
introduced
and
lady
loring
returned
to
her
guests
i
think
we
have
met
before
major
hynd
said
stella
her
voice
supplied
the
missing
link
in
the
major
s
memory
of
events
remembering
how
she
had
looked
at
romayne
on
the
deck
of
the
steamboat
he
began
dimly
to
understand
miss
eyrecourt
s
otherwise
incomprehensible
anxiety
to
be
of
use
to
the
general
s
family
i
remember
perfectly
he
answered
it
was
on
the
passage
from
boulogne
to
folkestone
and
my
friend
was
with
me
you
and
he
have
no
doubt
met
since
that
time
he
put
the
question
as
a
mere
formality
the
unexpressed
thought
in
him
was
another
of
them
in
love
with
romayne
and
nothing
as
usual
likely
to
come
of
i
hope
you
have
forgiven
me
for
going
to
camp
s
hill
in
your
place
said
stella
i
ought
to
be
grateful
to
you
the
major
rejoined
no
time
has
been
lost
in
relieving
these
poor
people
and
your
powers
of
persuasion
have
succeeded
where
mine
might
have
failed
has
romayne
been
to
see
them
himself
since
his
return
to
london
no
he
desires
to
remain
unknown
and
he
is
kindly
content
for
the
present
to
be
represented
by
for
the
major
hynd
repeated
a
faint
flush
passed
over
her
delicate
complexion
i
have
succeeded
she
resumed
in
inducing
madame
marillac
to
accept
the
help
offered
through
me
to
her
son
the
poor
creature
is
safe
under
kind
superintendence
in
a
private
asylum
so
far
i
can
do
no
will
the
mother
accept
nothing
nothing
either
for
herself
or
her
daughter
so
long
as
they
can
work
i
can
not
tell
you
how
patiently
and
beautifully
she
speaks
of
her
hard
lot
but
her
health
may
give
way
and
it
is
possible
before
long
that
i
may
leave
she
paused
the
flush
deepened
on
her
face
the
failure
of
the
mother
s
health
may
happen
in
my
absence
she
continued
and
romayne
will
ask
you
to
look
after
the
family
from
time
to
time
while
i
am
i
will
do
it
with
pleasure
miss
eyrecourt
is
romayne
likely
to
be
here
she
smiled
brightly
and
looked
away
the
major
s
curiosity
was
excited
he
looked
in
the
same
direction
there
was
romayne
entering
the
room
to
answer
for
himself
what
was
the
attraction
which
drew
the
unsocial
student
to
an
evening
party
major
hynd
s
eyes
were
on
the
watch
when
romayne
and
stella
shook
hands
the
attraction
stood
to
him
in
miss
eyrecourt
recalling
the
momentary
confusion
which
she
had
betrayed
when
she
spoke
of
possibly
leaving
london
and
of
romayne
s
plans
for
supplying
her
place
as
his
almoner
the
major
with
military
impatience
of
delays
jumped
to
a
conclusion
i
was
wrong
he
thought
my
impenetrable
friend
is
touched
in
the
right
place
at
last
when
the
splendid
creature
in
yellow
leaves
london
the
name
on
her
luggage
will
be
you
are
looking
quite
another
man
romayne
he
said
mischievously
since
we
met
stella
gently
moved
away
leaving
them
to
talk
freely
romayne
took
no
advantage
of
the
circumstance
to
admit
his
old
friend
to
his
confidence
whatever
relations
might
really
exist
between
miss
eyrecourt
and
himself
were
evidently
kept
secret
thus
far
my
health
has
been
a
little
better
lately
was
the
only
reply
he
made
the
major
dropped
his
voice
to
a
whisper
have
you
not
had
any
return
he
began
romayne
stopped
him
there
i
don
t
want
my
infirmities
made
public
he
whispered
back
irritably
look
at
the
people
all
round
us
when
i
tell
you
i
have
been
better
lately
ought
to
know
what
it
any
discoverable
reason
for
the
improvement
persisted
the
major
still
bent
on
getting
evidence
in
support
of
his
own
private
conclusions
none
romayne
answered
sharply
but
major
hynd
was
not
to
be
discouraged
by
sharp
replies
miss
eyrecourt
and
i
have
been
recalling
our
first
meeting
on
board
the
steamboat
he
went
on
do
you
remember
how
indifferent
you
were
to
that
beautiful
person
when
i
asked
you
if
you
knew
her
i
m
glad
to
see
that
you
show
better
taste
i
wish
i
knew
her
well
enough
to
shake
hands
as
you
hynd
when
a
young
man
talks
nonsense
his
youth
is
his
excuse
at
your
time
of
life
you
have
passed
the
excusable
age
even
in
the
estimation
of
your
with
those
words
romayne
turned
away
the
incorrigible
major
instantly
met
the
reproof
inflicted
on
him
with
a
smart
answer
remember
he
said
that
i
was
the
first
of
your
friends
to
wish
you
happiness
he
too
turned
away
in
the
direction
of
the
champagne
and
the
sandwiches
meanwhile
stella
had
discovered
penrose
lost
in
the
brilliant
assemblage
of
guests
standing
alone
in
a
corner
it
was
enough
for
her
that
romayne
s
secretary
was
also
romayne
s
friend
passing
by
titled
and
celebrated
personages
all
anxious
to
speak
to
her
she
joined
the
shy
nervous
little
man
and
did
all
she
could
to
set
him
at
his
ease
i
am
afraid
penrose
this
is
not
a
very
attractive
scene
to
having
said
those
kind
words
she
paused
penrose
was
looking
at
her
confusedly
but
with
an
expression
of
interest
which
was
new
to
her
experience
of
him
has
romayne
told
him
she
wondered
inwardly
it
is
a
very
beautiful
scene
miss
eyrecourt
he
said
in
his
low
quiet
tones
did
you
come
here
with
romayne
she
asked
yes
it
was
by
his
advice
that
i
accepted
the
invitation
with
which
lady
loring
has
honored
me
i
am
sadly
out
of
place
in
such
an
assembly
as
this
but
i
would
make
far
greater
sacrifices
to
please
she
smiled
kindly
attachment
so
artlessly
devoted
to
the
man
she
loved
pleased
and
touched
her
in
her
anxiety
to
discover
a
subject
which
might
interest
him
she
overcame
her
antipathy
to
the
spiritual
director
of
the
household
is
father
benwell
coming
to
us
she
inquired
he
will
certainly
be
here
miss
eyrecourt
if
he
can
get
back
to
london
in
has
he
been
long
away
nearly
a
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
she
still
paid
penrose
the
compliment
of
feigning
an
interest
in
father
benwell
has
he
a
long
journey
to
make
in
returning
to
london
she
asked
yes
all
the
way
from
from
south
devonshire
no
north
devonshire
the
smile
suddenly
left
her
face
she
put
another
question
without
quite
concealing
the
effort
that
it
cost
her
or
the
anxiety
with
which
she
waited
for
the
reply
i

i
wonder
whether

benwell

visiting

mine

the

with
a
gentle
inclination
of
her
head
she
turned
toward
other
guests
looked
back
and
with
a
last
little
courteous
attention
offered
to
him
said
if
you
like

penrose
i
advise
you
to
go
to

they
are

thanked
her
noticing
that
her
voice
and
manner
had
become
strangely
subdued
she
made
her
way
back
to
the
room
in
which
the
hostess
received
her
guests
lady
loring
was
for
the
moment
alone
resting
on
a
sofa
stella
stooped
over
her
and
spoke
in
cautiously
lowered
tones
if
father
benwell
comes
here

the
question
of
marriage
as
stella
answered
lady
loring
she
was
smartly
tapped
on
the
shoulder
by
an
eager
guest
with
a
fan
the
guest
was
a
very
little
woman
with
twinkling
eyes
and
a
perpetual
smile
nature
corrected
by
powder
and
paint
was
liberally
displayed
in
her
arms
her
bosom
and
the
upper
part
of
her
back
such
clothes
as
she
wore
defective
perhaps
in
quantity
were
in
quality
absolutely
perfect
more
adorable
color
shape
and
workmanship
never
appeared
even
in
a
milliner
s
her
light
hair
was
dressed
with
a
fringe
and
ringlets
on
the
pattern
which
the
portraits
of
the
time
of
charles
the
second
have
made
familiar
to
us
there
was
nothing
exactly
young
or
exactly
old
about
her
except
her
voice
which
betrayed
a
faint
hoarseness
attributable
possibly
to
exhaustion
produced
by
untold
years
of
incessant
talking
it
might
be
added
that
she
was
as
active
as
a
squirrel
and
as
playful
as
a
kitten
but
the
lady
must
be
treated
with
a
certain
forbearance
of
tone
for
this
good
reason
she
was
stella
s
mother
stella
turned
quickly
at
the
tap
of
the
fan
mamma
she
exclaimed
how
you
startle
me
my
dear
child
said
eyrecourt
you
are
constitutionally
indolent
and
you
want
startling
go
into
the
next
room
directly
romayne
is
looking
for
stella
drew
back
a
step
and
eyed
her
mother
in
blank
surprise
is
it
possible
that
you
know
him
she
asked
mr
romayne
doesn
t
go
into
society
or
we
should
have
met
long
since
eyrecourt
replied
he
is
a
striking
person
and
i
noticed
him
when
he
shook
hands
with
you
that
was
quite
enough
for
me
i
have
just
introduced
myself
to
him
as
your
mother
he
was
a
little
stately
and
stiff
but
most
charming
when
he
knew
who
i
was
i
volunteered
to
find
you
he
was
quite
astonished
i
think
he
took
me
for
your
elder
sister
not
the
least
like
each
other
are
we
lady
loring
she
takes
after
her
poor
dear
father
was
constitutionally
indolent
my
sweet
child
rouse
yourself
you
have
drawn
a
prize
in
the
great
lottery
at
last
if
ever
a
man
was
in
love
romayne
is
that
man
i
am
a
physiognomist
lady
loring
and
i
see
the
passions
in
the
face
oh
stella
what
a
property
vange
abbey
i
once
drove
that
way
when
i
was
visiting
in
the
neighborhood
superb
and
another
fortune
twelve
thousand
a
year
and
a
villa
at
highgate
since
the
death
of
his
aunt
and
my
daughter
may
be
mistress
of
this
if
she
only
plays
her
cards
properly
what
a
compensation
after
all
that
we
suffered
through
that
monster
winterfield
mamma
pray
don
t
stella
i
will
be
interrupted
when
i
am
speaking
to
you
for
your
own
good
i
don
t
know
a
more
provoking
person
lady
loring
than
my
daughter
on
certain
occasions
and
yet
i
love
her
i
would
go
through
fire
and
water
for
my
beautiful
child
only
last
week
i
was
at
a
wedding
and
i
thought
of
stella
the
church
was
crammed
to
the
doors
a
hundred
at
the
wedding
breakfast
the
bride
s
lace
there
no
language
can
describe
it
ten
bridesmaids
in
blue
and
silver
reminded
me
of
the
ten
virgins
only
the
proportion
of
foolish
ones
this
time
was
certainly
more
than
five
however
they
looked
well
the
archbishop
proposed
the
health
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
so
sweetly
pathetic
some
of
us
cried
i
thought
of
my
daughter
oh
if
i
could
live
to
see
stella
the
central
attraction
so
to
speak
of
such
a
wedding
as
that
only
i
would
have
twelve
bridesmaids
at
least
and
beat
the
blue
and
silver
with
green
and
gold
trying
to
the
complexion
you
will
say
but
there
are
artificial
improvements
at
least
i
am
told
so
what
a
house
this
would
be
a
broad
hint
isn
t
it
dear
lady
loring
what
a
house
for
a
wedding
with
the
to
assemble
in
and
the
picture
gallery
for
the
breakfast
i
know
the
archbishop
my
darling
he
shall
marry
you
why
you
go
into
the
next
room
ah
that
constitutional
indolence
if
you
only
had
my
energy
as
i
used
to
say
to
your
poor
father
you
go
yes
dear
lady
loring
i
should
like
a
glass
of
champagne
and
another
of
those
delicious
chicken
sandwiches
if
you
don
t
go
stella
i
shall
forget
every
consideration
of
propriety
and
big
as
you
are
i
shall
push
you
stella
yielded
to
necessity
keep
her
quiet
if
you
can
she
whispered
to
lady
loring
in
the
moment
of
silence
that
followed
even
eyrecourt
was
not
able
to
talk
while
she
was
drinking
champagne
in
the
next
room
stella
found
romayne
he
looked
careworn
and
irritable
but
brightened
directly
when
she
approached
him
my
mother
has
been
speaking
to
you
she
said
i
am
afraid
he
stopped
her
there
she
your
mother
he
interposed
kindly
don
t
think
that
i
am
ungrateful
enough
to
forget
she
took
his
arm
and
looked
at
him
with
all
her
heart
in
her
eyes
come
into
a
quieter
room
she
whispered
romayne
led
her
away
neither
of
them
noticed
penrose
as
they
left
the
room
he
had
not
moved
since
stella
had
spoken
to
him
there
he
remained
in
his
corner
absorbed
in
thought
and
not
in
happy
thought
as
his
face
would
have
plainly
betrayed
to
any
one
who
had
cared
to
look
at
him
his
eyes
sadly
followed
the
retiring
figures
of
stella
and
romayne
the
color
rose
on
his
haggard
cheeks
like
most
men
who
are
accustomed
to
live
alone
he
had
the
habit
when
he
was
strongly
excited
of
speaking
to
himself
no
he
said
as
the
unacknowledged
lovers
disappeared
through
the
door
it
is
an
insult
to
ask
me
to
do
it
he
turned
the
other
way
escaped
lady
loring
s
notice
in
the
and
left
the
house
romayne
and
stella
passed
through
the
and
the
turned
into
a
corridor
and
entered
the
conservatory
for
the
first
time
the
place
was
a
solitude
the
air
of
a
dance
faintly
audible
through
the
open
windows
of
the
ballroom
above
had
proved
an
irresistible
temptation
those
who
knew
the
dance
were
eager
to
exhibit
themselves
those
who
had
only
heard
of
it
were
equally
anxious
to
look
on
and
learn
even
toward
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
youths
and
maidens
of
society
can
still
be
in
earnest
when
the
object
in
view
is
a
new
dance
what
would
major
hynd
have
said
if
he
had
seen
romayne
turn
into
one
of
the
recesses
of
the
conservatory
in
which
there
was
a
seat
which
just
held
two
but
the
major
had
forgotten
his
years
and
his
family
and
he
too
was
one
of
the
spectators
in
the
ballroom
i
wonder
said
stella
whether
you
know
how
i
feel
those
kind
words
of
yours
when
you
spoke
of
my
mother
shall
i
tell
you
she
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
he
was
a
man
new
to
love
in
the
nobler
sense
of
the
word
the
exquisite
softness
in
the
touch
of
her
lips
the
delicious
fragrance
of
her
breath
intoxicated
him
again
and
again
he
returned
the
kiss
she
drew
back
she
recovered
her
with
a
suddenness
and
a
certainty
incomprehensible
to
a
man
from
the
depths
of
tenderness
she
passed
to
the
shallows
of
frivolity
in
her
own
defense
she
was
almost
as
superficial
as
her
mother
in
less
than
a
moment
what
would
penrose
say
if
he
saw
you
she
whispered
why
do
you
speak
of
penrose
have
you
seen
him
yes
looking
sadly
out
of
his
element
poor
man
i
did
my
best
to
set
him
at
his
ease
because
i
know
like
dear
stella
no
not
again
i
am
speaking
seriously
now
penrose
looked
at
me
with
a
strange
kind
of
interest
i
can
t
describe
it
have
you
taken
him
into
our
confidence
he
is
so
devoted
he
has
such
a
true
interest
in
me
said
romayne
i
really
felt
ashamed
to
treat
him
like
a
stranger
on
our
journey
to
london
i
did
own
that
it
was
your
charming
letter
which
had
decided
me
on
returning
i
did
say
i
must
tell
her
myself
how
well
she
has
understood
me
and
how
deeply
i
feel
her
penrose
took
my
hand
in
his
gentle
considerate
way
i
understand
you
too
he
said
and
that
was
all
that
passed
between
nothing
more
since
that
time
not
a
word
of
what
we
said
to
each
other
when
we
were
alone
last
week
in
the
picture
gallery
not
a
word
i
am
enough
to
distrust
myself
even
now
god
knows
i
have
concealed
nothing
from
you
and
yet
am
i
not
selfishly
thinking
of
my
own
happiness
stella
when
i
ought
to
be
thinking
only
of
you
you
know
my
angel
with
what
a
life
you
must
associate
yourself
if
you
marry
me
are
you
really
sure
that
you
have
love
enough
and
courage
enough
to
be
my
wife
she
rested
her
head
caressingly
on
his
shoulder
and
looked
up
at
him
with
her
charming
smile
how
many
times
must
i
say
it
she
asked
before
you
will
believe
me
once
more
i
have
love
enough
and
courage
enough
to
be
your
wife
and
i
knew
it
lewis
the
first
time
i
saw
you
will
confession
satisfy
your
scruples
and
will
you
promise
never
again
to
doubt
yourself
or
me
romayne
promised
and
sealed
the
promise
unresisted
this
time
with
a
kiss
when
are
we
to
be
married
he
whispered
she
lifted
her
head
from
his
shoulder
with
a
sigh
if
i
am
to
answer
you
honestly
she
replied
i
must
speak
of
my
mother
before
i
speak
of
romayne
submitted
to
the
duties
of
his
new
position
as
well
as
he
understood
them
do
you
mean
that
you
have
told
your
mother
of
our
engagement
he
said
in
that
case
is
it
my
duty
or
yours
i
am
very
ignorant
in
these
matters
to
consult
her
wishes
my
own
idea
is
that
i
ought
to
ask
her
if
she
approves
of
me
as
her
and
that
you
might
then
speak
to
her
of
the
stella
thought
of
romayne
s
tastes
all
in
favor
of
modest
retirement
and
of
her
mother
s
tastes
all
in
favor
of
ostentation
and
display
she
frankly
owned
the
result
produced
in
her
own
mind
i
am
afraid
to
consult
my
mother
about
our
marriage
she
said
romayne
looked
astonished
do
you
think
eyrecourt
will
disapprove
of
it
he
asked
stella
was
equally
astonished
on
her
side
disapprove
of
it
she
repeated
i
know
for
certain
that
my
mother
will
be
then
where
is
the
difficulty
there
was
but
one
way
of
definitely
answering
that
question
stella
boldly
described
her
mother
s
idea
of
a
wedding
including
the
archbishop
the
twelve
bridesmaids
in
green
and
gold
and
the
hundred
guests
at
breakfast
in
lord
loring
s
picture
gallery
romayne
s
consternation
literally
deprived
him
for
the
moment
of
the
power
of
speech
to
say
that
he
looked
at
stella
as
a
prisoner
in
the
condemned
cell
might
have
looked
at
the
sheriff
announcing
the
morning
of
his
execution
would
be
to
do
injustice
to
the
prisoner
he
receives
shock
without
flinching
and
in
proof
of
his
composure
celebrates
his
wedding
with
the
gallows
by
a
breakfast
which
he
will
not
live
to
digest
if
you
think
as
your
mother
does
romayne
began
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
his
no
opinion
of
mine
shall
stand
in
the
way
he
could
get
no
further
his
vivid
imagination
saw
the
archbishop
and
the
bridesmaids
heard
the
hundred
guests
and
their
dreadful
speeches
his
voice
faltered
in
spite
of
himself
stella
eagerly
relieved
him
my
darling
i
don
t
think
as
my
mother
does
she
interposed
tenderly
i
am
sorry
to
say
we
have
very
few
sympathies
in
common
marriages
as
i
think
ought
to
be
celebrated
as
privately
as
possible
the
near
and
dear
relations
present
and
no
one
else
if
there
must
be
rejoicings
and
banquets
and
hundreds
of
invitations
let
them
come
when
the
wedded
pair
are
at
home
after
the
honeymoon
beginning
life
in
earnest
these
are
odd
ideas
for
a
woman
to
have
but
they
my
ideas
for
all
romayne
s
face
brightened
how
few
women
possess
your
fine
sense
and
your
delicacy
of
feeling
he
exclaimed
surely
your
mother
must
give
way
when
she
hears
we
are
both
of
one
mind
about
our
stella
knew
her
mother
too
well
to
share
the
opinion
thus
expressed
eyrecourt
s
capacity
for
holding
to
her
own
little
ideas
and
for
persisting
where
her
social
interests
were
concerned
in
trying
to
insinuate
those
ideas
into
the
minds
of
other
persons
was
a
capacity
which
no
resistance
short
of
absolute
brutality
could
overcome
she
was
perfectly
capable
of
worrying
romayne
as
well
as
her
daughter
to
the
utmost
limits
of
human
endurance
in
the
firm
conviction
that
she
was
bound
to
convert
all
heretics
of
their
way
of
thinking
to
the
orthodox
faith
in
the
matter
of
weddings
putting
this
view
of
the
case
with
all
possible
delicacy
in
speaking
of
her
mother
stella
expressed
herself
plainly
enough
nevertheless
to
enlighten
romayne
he
made
another
suggestion
can
we
marry
privately
he
said
and
tell
eyrecourt
of
it
afterward
this
essentially
masculine
solution
of
the
difficulty
was
at
once
rejected
stella
was
too
good
a
daughter
to
suffer
her
mother
to
be
treated
with
even
the
appearance
of
disrespect
oh
she
said
think
how
mortified
and
distressed
my
mother
would
be
she
be
present
at
my
an
idea
of
a
compromise
occurred
to
romayne
what
do
you
say
he
proposed
to
arranging
for
the
marriage
privately
and
then
telling
eyrecourt
only
a
day
or
two
beforehand
when
it
would
be
too
late
to
send
out
invitations
if
your
mother
would
be
disappointed
she
would
be
angry
stella
interposed
very
well
lay
all
the
blame
on
me
besides
there
might
be
two
other
persons
present
whom
i
am
sure
eyrecourt
is
always
glad
to
meet
you
don
t
object
to
lord
and
lady
loring
object
they
are
my
dearest
friends
as
well
as
yours
any
one
else
stella
any
one
lewis
whom
like
then
i
say
no
one
else
my
own
love
when
may
it
be
my
lawyers
can
get
the
settlements
ready
in
a
fortnight
or
less
will
you
say
in
a
fortnight
his
arm
was
round
her
waist
his
lips
were
touching
her
lovely
neck
she
was
not
a
woman
to
take
refuge
in
the
commonplace
coquetries
of
the
sex
yes
she
said
softly
if
you
wish
she
rose
and
withdrew
herself
from
him
for
my
sake
we
must
not
be
here
together
any
longer
as
she
spoke
the
music
in
the

of

did
not
appear
to
have
fatigued
him
he
was
as
cheerful
and
as
polite
as
ever
and
so
paternally
attentive
to
stella
that
it
was
quite
impossible
for
her
to
pass
him
with
a
formal
bow
i
have
come
all
the
way
from
devonshire
he
said
the
train
has
been
behind
time
as
usual
and
i
am
one
of
the
late
arrivals
in
consequence
i
miss
some
familiar
faces
at
this
delightful
party
romayne
for
instance
perhaps
he
is
not
one
of
the
guests
oh
has
he
gone
away
not
that
i
know
the
tone
of
her
replies
warned
father
benwell
to
let
romayne
be
he
tried
another
name
and
arthur
penrose
he
inquired
next
i
think
penrose
has
left
as
she
answered
she
looked
toward
lady
loring
the
hostess
was
the
center
of
a
circle
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
before
she
was
at
liberty
father
benwell
might
take
his
departure
stella
resolved
to
make
the
attempt
for
herself
which
she
had
asked
lady
loring
to
make
for
her
it
was
better
to
try
and
to
be
defeated
than
not
to
try
at
all
i
asked
penrose
what
part
of
devonshire
you
were
visiting
she
resumed
assuming
her
more
gracious
manner
i
know
something
myself
of
the
north
coast
especially
the
neighborhood
of
not
the
faintest
change
passed
over
the
priest
s
face
his
fatherly
smile
had
never
been
in
a
better
state
of
preservation
isn
t
it
a
charming
place
he
said
with
enthusiasm
clovelly
is
the
most
remarkable
and
most
beautiful
village
in
england
i
have
so
enjoyed
my
little
holiday
excursions
by
sea
and
excursions
by
land
you
know
i
feel
quite
young
again
he
lifted
his
eyebrows
playfully
and
rubbed
his
plump
hands
one
over
the
other
with
such
an
intolerably
innocent
air
of
enjoyment
that
stella
positively
hated
him
she
felt
her
capacity
for
failing
her
under
the
influence
of
strong
emotion
her
thoughts
lost
their
customary
discipline
in
attempting
to
fathom
father
benwell
she
was
conscious
of
having
undertaken
a
task
which
required
more
pliable
moral
qualities
than
she
possessed
to
her
own
unutterable
annoyance
she
was
at
a
loss
what
to
say
next
at
that
critical
moment
her
mother
appeared
eager
for
news
of
the
conquest
of
romayne
my
dear
child
how
pale
you
look
said
eyrecourt
come
with
me
directly
you
must
have
a
glass
of
this
dexterous
device
for
entrapping
stella
into
a
private
conversation
failed
not
now
mamma
thank
you
she
said
father
benwell
on
the
point
of
discreetly
withdrawing
stopped
and
looked
at
eyrecourt
with
an
appearance
of
respectful
interest
as
things
were
it
might
not
have
been
worth
his
while
to
take
the
trouble
of
discovering
her
but
when
she
actually
placed
herself
in
his
way
the
chance
of
turning
eyrecourt
to
useful
account
was
not
a
chance
to
be
neglected
your
mother
he
said
to
stella
i
should
feel
honored
if
you
will
introduce
having
not
very
willingly
performed
the
ceremony
of
presentation
stella
drew
back
a
little
she
had
no
desire
to
take
any
part
in
the
conversation
that
might
follow
but
she
had
her
own
reasons
for
waiting
near
enough
to
hear
it
in
the
meanwhile
eyrecourt
turned
on
her
inexhaustible
flow
of
with
her
customary
facility
no
distinction
of
persons
troubled
her
no
convictions
of
any
sort
stood
in
her
way
she
was
equally
ready
provided
she
met
him
in
good
society
to
make
herself
agreeable
to
a
puritan
or
a
papist
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
father
benwell
surely
i
met
you
at
that
delightful
evening
at
the
duke
s
i
mean
when
we
welcomed
the
cardinal
back
from
rome
dear
old
man
if
one
may
speak
so
familiarly
of
a
prince
of
the
church
how
charmingly
he
bears
his
new
honors
such
patriarchal
simplicity
as
every
one
remarked
have
you
seen
him
lately
the
idea
of
the
order
to
which
he
belonged
feeling
any
special
interest
in
a
cardinal
except
when
they
made
him
of
some
use
to
them
privately
amused
father
benwell
how
wise
the
church
was
he
thought
in
inventing
a
spiritual
aristocracy
even
this
fool
of
a
woman
is
impressed
by
his
spoken
reply
was
true
to
his
assumed
character
as
one
of
the
inferior
clergy
poor
priests
like
me
madam
see
but
little
of
princes
of
the
church
in
the
houses
of
saying
this
with
the
most
becoming
humility
he
turned
the
talk
in
a
more
productive
direction
before
eyrecourt
could
proceed
with
her
recollections
of
the
evening
at
the
duke
your
charming
daughter
and
i
have
been
talking
about
clovelly
he
continued
i
have
just
been
spending
a
little
holiday
in
that
delightful
place
it
was
a
surprise
to
me
eyrecourt
to
see
so
many
really
beautiful
country
seats
in
the
neighborhood
i
was
particularly
struck
you
know
it
of
course
by
beaupark
eyrecourt
s
little
twinging
eyes
suddenly
became
still
and
steady
it
was
only
for
a
moment
but
that
trifling
change
boded
ill
for
the
purpose
which
the
priest
had
in
view
even
the
wits
of
a
fool
can
be
quickened
by
contact
with
the
world
for
many
years
eyrecourt
had
held
her
place
in
society
acting
under
an
intensely
selfish
sense
of
her
own
interests
fortified
by
those
cunning
instincts
which
grow
best
in
a
barren
intellect
perfectly
unworthy
of
being
trusted
with
secrets
which
only
concerned
other
people
this
frivolous
creature
could
be
the
unassailable
guardian
of
secrets
which
concerned
herself
the
instant
the
priest
referred
indirectly
to
winterfield
by
speaking
of
beaupark
house
her
instincts
warned
her
as
if
in
words
be
careful
for
stella
s
sake
oh
yes
said
eyrecourt
i
know
beaupark
house
but
may
i
make
a
confession
she
added
with
her
sweetest
smile
father
benwell
caught
her
tone
with
his
customary
tact
a
confession
at
a
ball
is
a
novelty
even
in
my
experience
he
answered
with
sweetest
smile
how
good
of
you
to
encourage
me
proceeded
eyrecourt
no
thank
you
i
don
t
want
to
sit
down
my
confession
won
t
take
long
and
i
really
must
give
that
poor
pale
daughter
of
mine
a
glass
of
wine
a
student
of
human
nature
like
you
they
say
all
priests
are
students
of
human
nature
accustomed
of
course
to
be
consulted
in
difficulties
and
to
hear
confessions
must
know
that
we
poor
women
are
sadly
subject
to
whims
and
caprices
we
can
t
resist
them
as
men
do
and
the
dear
good
men
generally
make
allowances
for
us
well
do
you
know
that
place
of
winterfield
s
is
one
of
my
caprices
oh
dear
i
speak
carelessly
i
ought
to
have
said
the
place
represents
one
of
my
caprices
in
short
father
benwell
beaupark
house
is
perfectly
odious
to
me
and
i
think
clovelly
the
most
overrated
place
in
the
world
i
haven
t
the
least
reason
to
give
but
so
it
is
excessively
foolish
of
me
it
s
like
hysterics
i
can
t
help
it
i
m
sure
you
will
forgive
me
there
isn
t
a
place
on
the
habitable
globe
that
i
am
not
ready
to
feel
interested
in
except
detestable
devonshire
i
am
so
sorry
you
went
there
the
next
time
you
have
a
holiday
take
my
advice
try
the
i
should
like
it
of
all
things
said
father
benwell
only
i
don
t
speak
french
allow
me
to
get
miss
eyrecourt
a
glass
of
he
spoke
with
the
most
perfect
temper
and
tranquillity
having
paid
his
little
attention
to
stella
and
having
relieved
her
of
the
empty
glass
he
took
his
leave
with
a
parting
request
thoroughly
characteristic
of
the
man
are
you
staying
in
town
eyrecourt
he
asked
oh
of
course
at
the
height
of
the
season
may
i
have
the
honor
of
calling
on
you
and
talking
a
little
more
about
the
continent
if
he
had
said
it
in
so
many
words
he
could
hardly
have
informed
eyrecourt
more
plainly
that
he
thoroughly
understood
her
and
that
he
meant
to
try
again
strong
in
the
worldly
training
of
half
a
lifetime
she
at
once
informed
him
of
her
address
with
the
complimentary
phrases
proper
to
the
occasion
five
o
clock
tea
on
wednesdays
father
benwell
don
t
forget
the
moment
he
was
gone
she
drew
her
daughter
into
a
quiet
corner
don
t
be
frightened
stella
that
sly
old
person
has
some
interest
in
trying
to
find
out
about
winterfield
do
you
know
why
indeed
i
don
t
mamma
i
hate
him
oh
hush
hush
hate
him
as
much
as
you
like
but
always
be
civil
to
him
tell
me
have
you
been
in
the
conservatory
with
romayne
all
going
on
well
my
sweet
child
dear
dear
me
the
wine
has
done
you
no
good
you
re
as
pale
as
ever
is
it
that
priest
oh
pooh
pooh
leave
father
benwell
to
chapter
iv
in
the
small
hours
when
stella
left
the
conservatory
the
attraction
of
the
ball
for
romayne
was
at
an
end
he
went
back
to
his
rooms
at
the
hotel
penrose
was
waiting
to
speak
to
him
romayne
noticed
signs
of
suppressed
agitation
in
his
secretary
s
face
has
anything
happened
he
inquired
nothing
of
any
importance
penrose
answered
in
sad
subdued
tones
i
only
wanted
to
ask
you
for
leave
of
certainly
is
it
for
a
long
time
penrose
hesitated
you
have
a
new
life
opening
before
you
he
said
if
your
experience
of
that
life
is
as
i
hope
and
pray
it
may
be
a
happy
one
you
will
need
me
no
longer
we
may
not
meet
his
voice
began
to
tremble
he
could
say
no
more
not
meet
again
romayne
repeated
my
dear
penrose
if
forget
how
many
happy
days
i
owe
to
your
companionship
memory
is
to
be
trusted
do
you
really
know
what
my
new
life
is
to
be
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
have
said
to
stella
penrose
lifted
his
hand
with
a
gesture
of
entreaty
not
a
word
he
said
eagerly
do
me
one
more
kindness
leave
me
to
be
prepared
as
i
am
prepared
for
the
change
that
is
to
come
without
any
confidence
on
your
part
to
enlighten
me
further
don
t
think
me
ungrateful
i
have
reasons
for
saying
what
i
have
just
said
i
can
not
mention
what
they
are
i
can
only
tell
you
they
are
serious
reasons
you
have
spoken
of
my
devotion
to
you
if
you
wish
to
reward
me
a
more
than
i
deserve
bear
in
mind
our
conversations
on
religion
and
keep
the
books
i
asked
you
to
read
as
gifts
from
a
friend
who
loves
you
with
his
whole
heart
no
new
duties
that
you
can
undertake
are
incompatible
with
the
higher
interests
of
your
soul
think
of
me
sometimes
when
i
leave
you
i
go
back
to
a
lonely
life
my
poor
heart
is
full
of
your
brotherly
kindness
at
this
last
moment
when
i
may
be
saying
forever
and
what
is
my
one
consolation
what
helps
me
to
bear
my
hard
lot
the
faith
that
i
hold
remember
that
romayne
if
there
comes
a
time
of
sorrow
in
the
future
remember
romayne
was
more
than
surprised
he
was
shocked
why
must
you
leave
me
he
asked
it
is
best
for
you
and
for
said
penrose
that
i
should
withdraw
myself
from
your
new
he
held
out
his
hand
romayne
refused
to
let
him
go
penrose
he
said
i
can
t
match
your
resignation
give
me
something
to
look
forward
to
i
must
and
will
see
you
penrose
smiled
sadly
you
know
that
my
career
in
life
depends
wholly
on
my
superiors
he
answered
but
if
i
am
still
in
england
and
if
you
have
sorrows
in
the
future
that
i
can
share
and
alleviate
only
let
me
know
it
there
is
nothing
within
the
compass
of
my
power
which
i
will
not
do
for
your
sake
god
bless
and
prosper
you
in
spite
of
his
fortitude
the
tears
rose
in
his
eyes
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
romayne
sat
down
at
his
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
he
had
entered
the
room
with
the
bright
image
of
stella
in
his
mind
the
image
had
faded
from
it
now
the
grief
that
was
in
him
not
even
the
beloved
woman
could
share
his
thoughts
were
wholly
with
the
brave
and
patient
christian
who
had
left
him
the
true
man
whose
spotless
integrity
no
evil
influence
could
corrupt
by
what
inscrutable
fatality
do
some
men
find
their
way
into
spheres
that
are
unworthy
of
them
oh
penrose
if
the
priests
of
your
order
were
all
like
you
how
easily
i
should
be
converted
these
were
romayne
s
thoughts
in
the
stillness
of
the
first
hours
of
the
morning
the
books
of
which
his
lost
friend
had
spoken
were
close
by
him
on
the
table
he
opened
one
of
them
and
turned
to
a
page
marked
by
pencil
lines
his
sensitive
nature
was
troubled
to
its
inmost
depths
the
confession
of
that
faith
which
had
upheld
penrose
was
before
him
in
words
the
impulse
was
strong
in
him
to
read
those
words
and
think
over
them
again
he
trimmed
his
lamp
and
bent
his
mind
on
his
book
while
he
was
still
reading
the
ball
at
lord
loring
s
house
came
to
its
end
stella
and
lady
loring
were
alone
together
talking
of
him
before
they
retired
to
their
rooms
forgive
me
for
owning
it
plainly
said
lady
loring
i
think
you
and
your
mother
are
a
little
too
ready
to
suspect
father
benwell
without
any
discoverable
cause
thousands
of
people
go
to
clovelly
and
beaupark
house
is
one
of
the
in
the
neighborhood
is
there
a
little
protestant
prejudice
in
this
new
idea
of
yours
stella
made
no
reply
she
seemed
to
be
lost
in
her
own
thoughts
lady
loring
went
on
i
am
open
to
conviction
my
dear
if
you
will
only
tell
me
what
interest
father
benwell
can
have
in
knowing
about
you
and
winterfield
stella
suddenly
looked
up
let
us
speak
of
another
person
she
said
i
own
i
don
t
like
father
benwell
as
you
know
romayne
has
concealed
nothing
from
me
ought
i
to
have
any
concealments
from
ought
i
not
to
tell
him
about
winterfield
lady
loring
started
you
astonish
me
she
said
what
right
has
romayne
to
know
it
what
right
have
i
to
keep
it
a
secret
from
him
my
dear
stella
if
you
had
been
in
any
way
to
blame
in
that
miserable
matter
i
should
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
advise
you
to
keep
it
a
secret
but
you
are
innocent
of
all
blame
no
man
not
even
the
man
who
is
soon
to
be
your
husband
has
a
right
to
know
what
you
have
so
unjustly
suffered
think
of
the
humiliation
of
even
speaking
of
it
to
romayne
i
daren
t
think
of
it
cried
stella
passionately
but
if
it
is
my
duty
it
is
your
duty
to
consider
the
consequences
lady
loring
interposed
you
don
t
know
how
such
things
sometimes
rankle
in
a
man
s
mind
he
may
be
perfectly
willing
to
do
you
justice
and
yet
there
may
be
moments
when
he
would
doubt
if
you
had
told
him
the
whole
truth
i
speak
with
the
experience
of
a
married
woman
don
t
place
yourself
in
position
toward
your
husband
if
you
wish
for
a
happy
married
stella
was
not
quite
convinced
yet
suppose
romayne
finds
it
out
she
said
he
can
t
possibly
find
it
out
i
detest
winterfield
but
let
us
do
him
justice
he
is
no
fool
he
has
his
position
in
the
world
to
keep
up
and
that
is
enough
of
itself
to
close
his
lips
and
as
for
others
there
are
only
three
people
now
in
england
who
betray
you
i
suppose
you
can
trust
your
mother
and
lord
loring
and
me
it
was
needless
to
answer
such
a
question
as
that
before
stella
could
speak
again
lord
loring
s
voice
was
audible
outside
the
door
what
talking
still
he
exclaimed
not
in
bed
yet
come
in
cried
his
wife
let
us
hear
what
my
husband
thinks
she
said
to
stella
lord
loring
listened
with
the
closest
attention
while
the
subject
under
discussion
was
communicated
to
him
when
the
time
came
to
give
his
opinion
he
sided
unhesitatingly
with
his
wife
if
the
fault
was
yours
even
in
the
slightest
degree
he
said
to
stella
romayne
would
have
a
right
to
be
taken
into
your
confidence
but
my
dear
child
we
who
know
the
truth
know
you
to
be
a
pure
and
innocent
woman
you
go
to
romayne
in
every
way
worthy
of
him
and
you
know
that
he
loves
you
if
you
did
tell
him
that
miserable
story
he
could
only
pity
you
do
you
want
to
be
pitied
those
last
unanswerable
words
brought
the
debate
to
an
end
from
that
moment
the
subject
was
dropped
there
was
still
one
other
person
among
the
guests
at
the
ball
who
was
waking
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
father
benwell
wrapped
comfortably
in
his
dressing
gown
was
too
hard
at
work
on
his
correspondence
to
think
of
his
bed
with
one
exception
all
the
letters
that
he
had
written
thus
far
were
closed
directed
and
stamped
for
the
post
the
letter
that
he
kept
open
he
was
now
engaged
in
reconsidering
and
correcting
it
was
addressed
as
usual
to
the
secretary
of
the
order
at
rome
and
when
it
had
undergone
the
final
revision
it
contained
these
lines
my
last
letter
informed
you
of
romayne
s
return
to
london
and
to
miss
eyrecourt
let
me
entreat
our
reverend
brethren
to
preserve
perfect
tranquillity
of
mind
in
spite
of
this
circumstance
the
owner
of
vange
abbey
is
not
married
yet
if
patience
and
perseverance
on
my
part
win
their
fair
reward
miss
eyrecourt
shall
never
be
his
wife
but
let
me
not
conceal
the
truth
in
the
uncertain
future
that
lies
before
us
i
have
no
one
to
depend
on
but
myself
penrose
is
no
longer
to
be
trusted
and
the
exertions
of
the
agent
to
whom
i
committed
my
inquiries
are
exertions
that
have
failed
i
will
dispose
of
the
case
of
penrose
first
the
zeal
with
which
this
young
man
has
undertaken
the
work
of
conversion
intrusted
to
him
has
i
regret
to
say
not
been
fired
by
devotion
to
the
interests
of
the
church
but
by
a
affection
for
romayne
without
waiting
for
my
permission
penrose
has
revealed
himself
in
his
true
character
as
a
priest
and
more
than
this
he
has
not
only
refused
to
observe
the
proceedings
of
romayne
and
miss
eyrecourt
he
has
deliberately
closed
his
ears
to
the
confidence
which
romayne
wished
to
repose
in
him
on
the
ground
that
i
might
have
ordered
him
to
repeat
that
confidence
to
me
to
what
use
can
we
put
this
poor
fellow
s
ungovernable
sense
of
honor
and
gratitude
under
present
circumstances
he
is
clearly
of
little
use
to
us
i
have
therefore
given
him
time
to
think
that
is
to
say
i
have
not
opposed
his
leaving
london
to
assist
in
the
spiritual
care
of
a
country
district
it
will
be
a
question
for
the
future
whether
we
may
not
turn
his
enthusiasm
to
good
account
in
a
foreign
mission
however
as
it
is
always
possible
that
his
influence
may
still
be
of
use
to
us
i
venture
to
suggest
keeping
him
within
our
reach
until
romayne
s
conversion
has
actually
taken
place
don
t
suppose
that
the
present
separation
between
them
is
final
i
will
answer
for
their
meeting
again
i
may
now
proceed
to
the
failure
of
my
agent
and
to
the
course
of
action
that
i
have
adopted
in
consequence
the
investigations
appear
to
have
definitely
broken
down
at
the
seaside
village
of
clovelly
in
the
neighborhood
of
winterfield
s
country
seat
knowing
that
i
could
depend
upon
the
information
which
associated
this
gentleman
with
miss
eyrecourt
under
compromising
circumstances
of
some
sort
i
decided
on
seeing
winterfield
and
judging
for
myself
the
agent
s
report
informed
me
that
the
person
who
had
finally
baffled
his
inquiries
was
an
aged
catholic
priest
long
resident
at
clovelly
his
name
is
newbliss
and
he
is
much
respected
among
the
catholic
gentry
in
that
part
of
devonshire
after
due
consideration
i
obtained
a
letter
of
introduction
to
my
reverend
colleague
and
traveled
to
clovelly
telling
my
friends
here
that
i
was
taking
a
little
holiday
in
the
interests
of
my
health
i
found
father
newbliss
a
venerable
and
reticent
son
of
the
church
with
one
weak
point
however
to
work
on
which
was
entirely
beyond
the
reach
of
the
otherwise
astute
person
charged
with
my
inquiries
my
reverend
friend
is
a
scholar
and
is
inordinately
proud
of
his
learning
i
am
a
scholar
too
in
that
capacity
i
first
found
my
way
to
his
sympathies
and
then
gently
encouraged
his
pride
the
result
will
appear
in
certain
discoveries
which
i
number
as
follows
the
events
which
connect
winterfield
with
miss
eyrecourt
happened
about
two
years
since
and
had
their
beginning
at
beaupark
house
at
this
period
miss
eyrecourt
and
her
mother
were
staying
at
beaupark
house
the
general
impression
in
the
neighborhood
was
that
winterfield
and
miss
eyrecourt
were
engaged
to
be
married
not
long
afterward
miss
eyrecourt
and
her
mother
surprised
the
neighborhood
by
suddenly
leaving
beaupark
house
their
destination
was
supposed
to
be
london
winterfield
himself
next
left
his
country
seat
for
the
continent
his
exact
destination
was
not
mentioned
to
any
one
the
steward
soon
afterward
dismissed
all
the
servants
and
the
house
was
left
empty
for
more
than
a
year
at
the
end
of
that
time
winterfield
returned
alone
to
beaupark
house
and
told
nobody
how
or
where
he
had
passed
the
long
interval
of
his
absence
winterfield
remains
to
the
present
day
an
unmarried
man
having
arrived
at
these
preliminary
discoveries
it
was
time
to
try
what
i
could
make
of
winterfield
next
among
the
other
good
things
which
this
gentleman
has
inherited
is
a
magnificent
library
collected
by
his
father
that
one
learned
man
should
take
another
learned
man
to
see
the
books
was
a
perfectly
natural
proceeding
my
introduction
to
the
master
of
the
house
followed
my
introduction
to
the
library
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
i
am
about
to
surprise
you
as
i
was
myself
surprised
in
all
my
long
experience
winterfield
is
i
think
the
most
fascinating
person
i
ever
met
with
genial
unassuming
manners
a
prepossessing
personal
appearance
a
sweet
temper
a
quaint
humor
delightfully
accompanied
by
natural
refinement
such
are
the
characteristic
qualities
of
the
man
from
whom
i
myself
saw
miss
eyrecourt
accidentally
meeting
him
in
public
recoil
with
dismay
and
disgust
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
look
at
him
and
to
believe
him
to
be
capable
of
a
cruel
or
dishonorable
action
i
never
was
so
puzzled
in
my
life
you
may
be
inclined
to
think
that
i
am
misled
by
a
false
impression
derived
from
the
gratifying
welcome
that
i
received
as
a
friend
of
father
newbliss
i
will
not
appeal
to
my
knowledge
of
human
nature
i
will
refer
to
the
unanswerable
evidence
of
winterfield
s
poorer
neighbors
wherever
i
went
in
the
village
or
out
of
it
if
i
mentioned
his
name
i
produced
a
universal
outburst
of
admiration
and
gratitude
there
never
was
such
a
friend
to
poor
people
and
there
never
can
be
such
another
to
the
end
of
the
such
was
a
fisherman
s
description
of
him
and
the
one
cry
of
all
the
men
and
women
near
us
answered
that
s
the
truth
and
yet
there
is
something
wrong
for
this
plain
reason
that
there
is
something
to
be
concealed
in
the
past
lives
of
winterfield
and
miss
eyrecourt
under
these
perplexing
circumstances
what
use
have
i
made
of
my
opportunities
i
am
going
to
surprise
you
again
i
have
mentioned
romayne
s
name
to
winterfield
and
i
have
ascertained
that
they
are
so
far
perfect
strangers
to
one
another
and
that
is
all
the
little
incident
of
mentioning
romayne
arose
out
of
my
examination
of
the
library
i
discovered
certain
old
volumes
which
may
one
day
be
of
use
to
him
if
he
continues
his
contemplated
work
on
the
origin
of
religions
hearing
me
express
myself
to
this
effect
winterfield
replied
with
the
readiest
kindness
i
can
t
compare
myself
to
my
excellent
father
he
said
but
i
have
at
least
inherited
his
respect
for
the
writers
of
books
my
library
is
a
treasure
which
i
hold
in
trust
for
the
interests
of
literature
pray
say
so
from
me
to
your
friend
and
what
does
this
amount
to
you
will
ask
my
reverend
friend
it
offers
me
an
opportunity
in
the
future
of
bringing
romayne
and
winterfield
together
do
you
see
the
complications
which
may
ensue
if
i
can
put
no
other
difficulty
in
miss
eyrecourt
s
way
i
think
there
is
fruitful
promise
of
a
scandal
of
some
kind
arising
out
of
the
introduction
to
each
other
of
those
two
men
you
will
agree
with
me
that
a
scandal
may
prove
a
valuable
obstacle
in
the
way
of
a
marriage
winterfield
has
kindly
invited
me
to
call
on
him
when
he
is
next
in
london
i
may
then
have
opportunities
of
putting
questions
which
i
could
not
venture
to
ask
on
a
short
acquaintance
in
the
meantime
i
have
obtained
another
introduction
since
my
return
to
town
i
have
been
presented
to
miss
eyrecourt
s
mother
and
i
am
invited
to
drink
tea
with
her
on
wednesday
my
next
letter
may
tell
you
what
penrose
ought
to
have
discovered
whether
romayne
has
been
already
entrapped
into
a
marriage
engagement
or
not
farewell
for
the
present
remind
the
reverend
fathers
with
my
respects
that
i
possess
one
of
the
valuable
qualities
of
an
englishman
i
never
know
when
i
am
beaten
book
the
third
chapter
i
the
honeymoon
more
than
six
weeks
had
passed
the
wedded
lovers
were
still
enjoying
their
honeymoon
at
vange
abbey
some
offense
had
been
given
not
only
to
eyrecourt
but
to
friends
of
her
way
of
thinking
by
the
strictly
private
manner
in
which
the
marriage
had
been
celebrated
the
event
took
everybody
by
surprise
when
the
customary
advertisement
appeared
in
the
newspapers
foreseeing
the
unfavorable
impression
that
might
be
produced
in
some
quarters
stella
had
pleaded
for
a
timely
retreat
to
the
seclusion
of
romayne
s
country
house
the
will
of
the
bride
being
as
usual
the
bridegroom
s
law
to
vange
they
retired
accordingly
on
one
lovely
moonlight
night
early
in
july
romayne
left
her
husband
on
the
belvidere
described
in
major
hynd
s
narrative
to
give
the
housekeeper
certain
instructions
relating
to
the
affairs
of
the
household
half
an
hour
later
as
she
was
about
to
ascend
again
to
the
top
of
the
house
one
of
the
servants
informed
her
that
the
master
had
just
left
the
belvidere
and
had
gone
into
his
crossing
the
inner
hall
on
her
way
to
the
study
stella
noticed
an
unopened
letter
addressed
to
romayne
lying
on
a
table
in
a
corner
he
had
probably
laid
it
aside
and
forgotten
it
she
entered
his
room
with
the
letter
in
her
hand
the
only
light
was
a
reading
lamp
with
the
shade
so
lowered
that
the
corners
of
the
study
were
left
in
obscurity
in
one
of
these
corners
romayne
was
dimly
visible
sitting
with
his
head
sunk
on
his
breast
he
never
moved
when
stella
opened
the
door
at
first
she
thought
he
might
be
asleep
do
i
disturb
you
lewis
she
asked
softly
no
my
there
was
a
change
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
which
his
wife
s
quick
ear
detected
i
am
afraid
you
are
not
well
she
said
anxiously
i
am
a
little
tired
after
our
long
ride
do
you
want
to
go
back
to
the
belvidere
not
without
you
shall
i
leave
you
to
rest
here
he
seemed
not
to
hear
the
question
there
he
sat
with
his
head
hanging
down
the
shadowy
counterfeit
of
an
old
man
in
her
anxiety
stella
approached
him
and
put
her
hand
caressingly
on
his
head
it
was
burning
hot
o
she
cried
you
ill
and
you
are
trying
to
hide
it
from
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
made
her
sit
on
his
knee
nothing
is
the
matter
with
me
he
said
with
an
uneasy
laugh
what
have
you
got
in
your
hand
a
letter
yes
addressed
to
you
and
not
opened
he
took
it
out
of
her
hand
and
threw
it
carelessly
on
a
sofa
near
him
never
mind
that
now
let
us
he
paused
and
kissed
her
before
he
went
on
my
darling
i
think
you
must
be
getting
tired
of
vange
oh
no
i
can
be
happy
anywhere
with
you
and
especially
at
vange
you
don
t
how
this
noble
old
house
interests
me
and
how
i
admire
the
glorious
country
all
round
he
was
not
convinced
vange
is
very
dull
he
said
obstinately
and
your
friends
will
be
wanting
to
see
you
have
you
heard
from
your
mother
lately
no
i
am
surprised
she
has
not
she
has
not
forgiven
us
for
getting
married
so
quietly
he
went
on
we
had
better
go
back
to
london
and
make
our
peace
with
her
don
t
you
want
to
see
the
house
my
aunt
left
me
at
highgate
stella
sighed
the
society
of
the
man
she
loved
was
society
enough
for
her
was
he
getting
tired
of
his
wife
already
i
will
go
with
you
wherever
you
she
said
those
words
in
tones
of
sad
submission
and
gently
got
up
from
his
knee
he
rose
also
and
took
from
the
sofa
the
letter
which
he
had
thrown
on
it
let
us
see
what
our
friends
say
he
resumed
the
address
is
in
loring
s
as
he
approached
the
table
on
which
the
lamp
was
burning
she
noticed
that
he
moved
with
a
languor
that
was
new
in
her
experience
of
him
he
sat
down
and
opened
the
letter
she
watched
him
with
an
anxiety
which
had
now
become
intensified
to
suspicion
the
shade
of
the
lamp
still
prevented
her
from
seeing
his
face
plainly
just
what
i
told
you
he
said
the
lorings
want
to
know
when
they
are
to
see
us
in
london
and
your
mother
says
she
feels
like
that
character
in
shakespeare
who
was
cut
by
his
own
read
he
handed
her
the
letter
in
taking
it
she
contrived
to
touch
the
lamp
shade
as
if
by
accident
and
tilted
it
so
that
the
full
flow
of
the
light
fell
on
him
he
started
back
but
not
before
she
had
seen
the
ghastly
pallor
on
his
face
she
had
not
only
heard
it
from
lady
loring
she
knew
from
his
own
unreserved
confession
to
her
what
that
startling
change
really
meant
in
an
instant
she
was
on
her
knees
at
his
feet
oh
my
darling
she
cried
it
was
cruel
to
keep
secret
from
your
wife
you
have
heard
it
again
she
was
too
irresistibly
beautiful
at
that
moment
to
be
reproved
he
gently
raised
her
from
the
floor
and
owned
the
truth
yes
he
said
i
heard
it
after
you
left
me
on
the
belvidere
just
as
i
heard
it
on
another
moonlight
night
when
major
hynd
was
here
with
me
our
return
to
this
house
is
perhaps
the
cause
i
don
t
complain
i
have
had
a
long
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
we
will
leave
vange
she
said
it
was
firmly
spoken
but
her
heart
sank
as
the
words
passed
her
lips
vange
abbey
had
been
the
scene
of
the
most
unalloyed
happiness
in
her
life
what
destiny
was
waiting
for
her
when
she
returned
to
london
chapter
ii
events
at
ten
acres
there
was
no
obstacle
to
the
speedy
departure
of
romayne
and
his
wife
from
vange
abbey
the
villa
at
highgate
called
ten
acres
lodge
in
allusion
to
the
measurement
of
the
grounds
surrounding
the
house
had
been
kept
in
perfect
order
by
the
servants
of
the
late
lady
berrick
now
in
the
employment
of
her
nephew
on
the
morning
after
their
arrival
at
the
villa
stella
sent
a
note
to
her
mother
the
same
afternoon
eyrecourt
arrived
at
ten
acres
on
her
way
to
a
finding
the
house
to
her
great
relief
a
modern
building
supplied
with
all
the
newest
comforts
and
luxuries
she
at
once
began
to
plan
a
grand
party
in
celebration
of
the
return
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
i
don
t
wish
to
praise
myself
eyrecourt
said
but
if
ever
there
was
a
forgiving
woman
i
am
that
person
we
will
say
no
more
stella
about
your
truly
contemptible
wedding
five
people
altogether
including
ourselves
and
the
lorings
a
grand
ball
will
set
you
right
with
society
and
that
is
the
one
thing
needful
tea
and
coffee
my
dear
romayne
in
your
study
coote
s
quadrille
band
the
supper
from
gunter
s
the
grounds
illuminated
with
colored
lamps
tyrolese
singers
among
the
trees
relieved
by
military
music
and
if
there
any
african
or
other
savages
now
in
london
there
is
room
enough
in
these
charming
grounds
for
encampments
dances
squaws
scalps
and
all
the
rest
of
it
to
end
in
a
blaze
of
a
sudden
fit
of
coughing
seized
her
and
stopped
the
further
enumeration
of
attractions
at
the
contemplated
ball
stella
had
observed
that
her
mother
looked
unusually
worn
and
haggard
through
the
disguises
of
paint
and
powder
this
was
not
an
uncommon
result
of
eyrecourt
s
devotion
to
the
demands
of
society
but
the
cough
was
something
new
as
a
symptom
of
exhaustion
i
am
afraid
mamma
you
have
been
overexerting
yourself
said
stella
you
go
to
too
many
nothing
of
the
sort
my
dear
i
am
as
strong
as
a
horse
the
other
night
i
was
waiting
for
the
carriage
in
a
draught
one
of
the
most
perfect
private
concerts
of
the
season
ending
with
a
delightfully
naughty
little
french
play
and
i
caught
a
slight
cold
a
glass
of
water
is
all
i
want
thank
you
romayne
you
are
looking
shockingly
serious
and
severe
our
ball
will
cheer
you
if
you
would
only
make
a
bonfire
of
all
those
horrid
books
you
don
t
know
how
it
would
improve
your
spirits
dearest
stella
i
will
come
and
lunch
here
you
are
within
such
a
nice
easy
drive
from
town
and
i
ll
bring
my
and
settle
about
the
invitations
and
the
day
oh
dear
me
how
late
it
is
i
have
nearly
an
hour
s
drive
before
i
get
to
my
garden
party
my
turtle
doves
she
was
stopped
on
the
way
to
her
carriage
by
another
fit
of
coughing
but
she
still
persisted
in
making
light
of
it
i
m
as
strong
as
a
horse
she
repeated
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
and
skipped
into
the
carriage
like
a
young
girl
your
mother
is
killing
herself
said
romayne
if
i
could
persuade
her
to
stay
with
us
a
little
while
stella
suggested
the
rest
and
quiet
might
do
wonders
for
her
would
you
object
to
it
lewis
my
darling
i
object
to
nothing
except
giving
a
ball
and
burning
my
books
if
your
mother
will
yield
on
these
two
points
my
house
is
entirely
at
her
he
spoke
playfully
he
looked
his
best
since
he
had
separated
himself
from
the
painful
associations
that
were
now
connected
with
vange
abbey
had
the
torment
of
the
voice
been
left
far
away
in
yorkshire
stella
shrank
from
approaching
the
subject
in
her
husband
s
presence
knowing
that
it
must
remind
him
of
the
fatal
duel
to
her
surprise
romayne
himself
referred
to
the
general
s
family
i
have
written
to
hynd
he
began
do
you
mind
his
dining
with
us
of
course
not
i
want
to
hear
if
he
has
anything
to
tell
me
about
those
french
ladies
he
undertook
to
see
them
in
your
absence
and
to
ascertain
he
was
unable
to
overcome
his
reluctance
to
pronounce
the
next
words
stella
was
quick
to
understand
what
he
meant
she
finished
the
sentence
for
him
yes
he
said
i
wanted
to
hear
how
the
boy
is
getting
on
and
if
there
is
any
hope
of
curing
him
is
it
he
trembled
as
he
put
the
question
is
it
hereditary
madness
feeling
the
serious
importance
of
concealing
the
truth
stella
only
replied
that
she
had
hesitated
to
ask
if
there
was
a
taint
of
madness
in
the
family
i
suppose
she
added
you
would
not
like
to
see
the
boy
and
judge
of
his
chances
of
recovery
for
yourself
you
suppose
he
burst
out
with
sudden
anger
you
might
be
sure
the
bare
idea
of
seeing
him
turns
me
cold
oh
when
shall
i
forget
when
shall
i
forget
who
spoke
of
him
first
he
said
with
renewed
irritability
after
a
moment
of
silence
you
or
i
it
was
my
fault
love
he
is
so
harmless
and
so
gentle
and
he
has
such
a
sweet
face
i
thought
it
might
soothe
you
to
see
him
forgive
me
we
will
never
speak
of
him
again
have
you
any
notes
for
me
to
copy
you
know
lewis
i
am
your
secretary
so
she
led
romayne
away
to
his
study
and
his
books
when
major
hynd
arrived
she
contrived
to
be
the
first
to
see
him
say
as
little
as
possible
about
the
general
s
widow
and
her
son
she
whispered
the
major
understood
her
don
t
be
uneasy
romayne
he
answered
i
know
your
husband
well
enough
to
know
what
you
mean
besides
the
news
i
bring
is
good
romayne
came
in
before
he
could
speak
more
particularly
when
the
servants
had
left
the
room
after
dinner
the
major
made
his
report
i
am
going
to
agreeably
surprise
you
he
began
all
responsibility
toward
the
general
s
family
is
taken
off
our
hands
the
ladies
are
on
their
way
back
to
stella
was
instantly
reminded
of
one
of
the
melancholy
incidents
associated
with
her
visit
to
camp
s
hill
madame
marillac
spoke
of
a
brother
of
hers
who
disapproved
of
the
marriage
she
said
has
he
forgiven
her
that
is
exactly
what
he
has
done
romayne
naturally
enough
he
felt
the
disgrace
of
his
sister
s
marriage
to
such
a
man
as
the
general
only
the
other
day
he
heard
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
a
widow
and
he
at
once
traveled
to
england
i
bade
them
yesterday
most
happily
reunited
on
their
journey
home
again
ah
i
thought
you
would
be
glad
romayne
to
hear
that
the
poor
widow
s
troubles
are
over
her
brother
is
rich
enough
to
place
them
all
in
easy
circumstances
he
is
as
good
a
fellow
as
ever
have
you
seen
him
stella
asked
eagerly
i
have
been
with
him
to
the
does
the
boy
go
back
to
france
no
we
took
the
place
by
surprise
and
saw
for
ourselves
how
well
conducted
it
was
the
boy
has
taken
a
strong
liking
to
the
proprietor
a
bright
cheerful
old
man
who
is
teaching
him
some
of
our
english
games
and
has
given
him
a
pony
to
ride
on
he
burst
out
crying
poor
creature
at
the
idea
of
going
away
and
his
mother
burst
out
crying
at
the
idea
of
leaving
him
it
was
a
melancholy
scene
you
know
what
a
good
mother
is
no
sacrifice
is
too
great
for
her
the
boy
stays
at
the
asylum
on
the
chance
that
his
healthier
and
happier
life
there
may
help
to
cure
him
romayne
his
uncle
desires
me
to
thank
you
hynd
you
didn
t
tell
the
uncle
my
name
don
t
alarm
yourself
he
is
a
gentleman
and
when
i
told
him
i
was
pledged
to
secrecy
he
made
but
one
inquiry
he
asked
if
you
were
a
rich
man
i
told
him
you
had
eighteen
thousand
a
well
well
he
set
that
matter
right
between
us
with
perfect
taste
he
said
i
can
not
presume
to
offer
repayment
to
a
person
so
wealthy
we
gratefully
accept
our
obligation
to
our
kind
unknown
friend
for
the
future
however
my
nephew
s
expenses
must
be
paid
from
my
of
course
i
could
only
agree
to
that
from
time
to
time
the
mother
is
to
hear
and
i
am
to
hear
how
the
boy
goes
on
or
if
you
like
romayne
now
that
the
general
s
family
has
left
england
i
don
t
see
why
the
proprietor
might
not
make
his
report
directly
to
no
romayne
rejoined
positively
let
things
remain
as
they
very
well
i
can
send
you
any
letters
that
i
may
receive
from
the
asylum
will
you
give
us
some
music
romayne
not
then
let
us
go
to
the
and
as
i
am
the
worst
of
bad
players
i
will
ask
you
to
help
me
to
beat
your
accomplished
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
eyrecourt
s
maid
arrived
at
ten
acres
with
a
note
from
her
mistress
dearest
stella
matilda
must
bring
you
my
excuses
for
i
don
t
in
the
least
understand
it
but
i
seem
to
have
turned
lazy
it
is
most
ridiculous
i
really
can
not
get
out
of
bed
perhaps
i
did
do
just
a
little
too
much
yesterday
the
opera
after
the
garden
party
and
a
ball
after
the
opera
and
this
tiresome
cough
all
night
after
the
ball
quite
a
series
isn
t
it
make
my
apologies
to
our
dear
dismal
romayne
and
if
you
drive
out
this
afternoon
come
and
have
a
chat
with
me
your
affectionate
mother
emily
eyrecourt
you
know
what
a
fidget
matilda
is
if
she
talks
about
me
don
t
believe
a
word
she
says
to
stella
turned
to
the
maid
with
a
sinking
heart
is
my
mother
very
ill
she
asked
so
ill
ma
am
that
i
begged
and
prayed
her
to
let
me
send
for
a
doctor
you
know
what
my
mistress
is
if
you
would
please
to
use
your
influence
i
will
order
the
carriage
instantly
and
take
you
back
with
before
she
dressed
to
go
out
stella
showed
the
letter
to
her
husband
he
spoke
with
perfect
kindness
and
sympathy
but
he
did
not
conceal
that
he
shared
his
wife
s
apprehensions
go
at
once
were
his
last
words
to
her
and
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
send
for
it
was
late
in
the
evening
before
stella
returned
she
brought
sad
news
the
physician
consulted
told
her
plainly
that
the
neglected
cough
and
the
constant
fatigue
had
together
made
the
case
a
serious
one
he
declined
to
say
that
there
was
any
absolute
danger
as
yet
or
any
necessity
for
her
remaining
with
her
mother
at
night
the
experience
of
the
next
hours
at
most
would
enable
him
to
speak
positively
in
the
meantime
the
patient
insisted
that
stella
should
return
to
her
husband
even
under
the
influence
of
opiates
eyrecourt
was
still
drowsily
equal
to
herself
you
are
a
fidget
my
dear
and
matilda
is
a
fidget
i
can
t
have
two
of
you
at
my
bedside
stella
stooped
over
her
and
kissed
her
she
whispered
three
weeks
notice
remember
for
the
party
by
the
next
evening
the
malady
had
assumed
so
formidable
an
aspect
that
the
doctor
had
his
doubts
of
the
patient
s
chance
of
recovery
with
her
husband
s
full
approval
stella
remained
night
and
day
at
her
mother
s
bedside
thus
in
a
little
more
than
a
month
from
the
day
of
his
marriage
romayne
was
for
the
time
a
lonely
man
again
the
illness
of
eyrecourt
was
unexpectedly
prolonged
there
were
intervals
during
which
her
vigorous
constitution
rallied
and
resisted
the
progress
of
the
disease
on
these
occasions
stella
was
able
to
return
to
her
husband
for
a
few
hours
subject
always
to
a
message
which
recalled
her
to
her
mother
when
the
chances
of
life
or
death
appeared
to
be
equally
balanced
romayne
s
one
resource
was
in
his
books
and
his
pen
for
the
first
time
since
his
union
with
stella
he
opened
the
portfolios
in
which
penrose
had
collected
the
first
introductory
chapters
of
his
historical
work
almost
at
every
page
the
familiar
handwriting
of
his
secretary
and
friend
met
his
view
it
was
a
new
trial
to
his
resolution
to
be
working
alone
never
had
he
felt
the
absence
of
penrose
as
he
felt
it
now
he
missed
the
familiar
face
the
quiet
pleasant
voice
and
more
than
both
the
sympathy
with
his
work
stella
had
done
all
that
a
wife
could
do
to
fill
the
vacant
place
and
her
husband
s
fondness
had
accepted
the
effort
as
adding
another
charm
to
the
lovely
creature
who
had
opened
a
new
life
to
him
but
where
is
the
woman
who
can
intimately
associate
herself
with
the
hard
of
a
man
devoted
to
an
absorbing
intellectual
pursuit
she
can
love
him
admire
him
serve
him
believe
in
him
beyond
all
other
men
but
in
spite
of
exceptions
which
only
prove
the
rule
she
is
out
of
her
place
when
she
enters
the
study
while
the
pen
is
in
his
hand
more
than
once
when
he
was
at
work
romayne
closed
the
page
bitterly
the
sad
thought
came
to
him
oh
if
i
only
had
penrose
here
even
other
friends
were
not
available
as
a
resource
in
the
solitary
evening
hours
lord
loring
was
absorbed
in
social
and
political
engagements
and
major
hynd
true
to
the
principle
of
getting
away
as
often
as
possible
from
his
disagreeable
wife
and
his
ugly
children
had
once
more
left
london
one
day
while
eyrecourt
still
lay
between
life
and
death
romayne
found
his
historical
labors
suspended
by
the
want
of
a
certain
volume
which
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
consult
he
had
mislaid
the
references
written
for
him
by
penrose
and
he
was
at
a
loss
to
remember
whether
the
book
was
in
the
british
museum
in
the
bodleian
library
or
in
the
bibliotheque
at
paris
in
this
emergency
a
letter
to
his
former
secretary
would
furnish
him
with
the
information
that
he
required
but
he
was
ignorant
of
penrose
s
present
address
the
lorings
might
possibly
know
it
so
to
the
lorings
he
resolved
to
apply
chapter
iii
father
benwell
and
the
book
romayne
s
first
errand
in
london
was
to
see
his
wife
and
to
make
inquiries
at
eyrecourt
s
house
the
report
was
more
favorable
than
usual
stella
whispered
as
she
kissed
him
i
shall
soon
come
back
to
you
i
hope
leaving
the
horses
to
rest
for
a
while
he
proceeded
to
lord
loring
s
residence
on
foot
as
he
crossed
a
street
in
the
neighborhood
he
was
nearly
run
over
by
a
cab
carrying
a
gentleman
and
his
luggage
the
gentleman
was
winterfield
on
his
way
to
derwent
s
hotel
lady
loring
very
kindly
searched
her
as
the
readiest
means
of
assisting
romayne
penrose
had
left
his
card
on
his
departure
from
london
but
no
address
was
written
on
it
lord
loring
unable
himself
to
give
the
required
information
suggested
the
right
person
to
consult
father
benwell
will
be
here
later
in
the
day
he
said
if
you
will
write
to
penrose
at
once
he
will
add
the
address
are
you
sure
before
the
letter
goes
that
the
book
you
want
is
not
in
my
library
i
think
not
romayne
answered
but
i
will
write
down
the
title
and
leave
it
here
with
my
the
same
evening
he
received
a
polite
note
from
father
benwell
informing
him
that
the
letter
was
forwarded
and
that
the
book
he
wanted
was
not
in
lord
loring
s
library
if
there
should
be
any
delay
or
difficulty
in
obtaining
this
rare
volume
the
priest
added
i
only
wait
the
expression
of
your
wishes
to
borrow
it
from
the
library
of
a
friend
of
mine
residing
in
the
by
return
of
post
the
answer
affectionately
and
gratefully
written
arrived
from
penrose
he
regretted
that
he
was
not
able
to
assist
romayne
personally
but
it
was
out
of
his
power
in
plain
words
he
had
been
expressly
forbidden
by
father
benwell
to
leave
the
service
on
which
he
was
then
engaged
in
reference
to
the
book
that
was
wanted
it
was
quite
likely
that
a
search
in
the
catalogues
of
the
british
museum
might
discover
it
he
had
only
met
with
it
himself
in
the
national
library
at
paris
this
information
led
romayne
to
london
again
immediately
for
the
first
time
he
called
at
father
benwell
s
lodgings
the
priest
was
at
home
expecting
the
visit
his
welcome
was
the
perfection
of
unassuming
politeness
he
asked
for
the
last
news
of
poor
eyrecourt
s
health
with
the
sympathy
of
a
true
friend
i
had
the
honor
of
drinking
tea
with
eyrecourt
some
little
time
since
he
said
her
flow
of
conversation
was
never
more
delightful
it
seemed
impossible
to
associate
the
idea
of
illness
with
so
bright
a
creature
and
how
well
she
kept
the
secret
of
your
contemplated
marriage
may
i
offer
my
humble
congratulations
and
good
wishes
romayne
thought
it
needless
to
say
that
eyrecourt
had
not
been
trusted
with
the
secret
until
the
wedding
day
was
close
at
hand
my
wife
and
i
agreed
in
wishing
to
be
married
as
quietly
as
possible
he
answered
after
making
the
customary
acknowledgments
and
romayne
pursued
father
benwell
this
is
a
sad
trial
for
her
she
is
in
attendance
on
her
mother
i
suppose
in
constant
attendance
i
am
quite
alone
now
to
change
the
subject
may
i
ask
you
to
look
at
the
reply
which
i
have
received
from
penrose
it
is
my
excuse
for
troubling
you
with
this
father
benwell
read
the
letter
with
the
closest
attention
in
spite
of
his
habitual
his
vigilant
eyes
brightened
as
he
handed
it
back
thus
far
the
priest
s
scheme
like
bitrake
s
clever
inquiries
had
failed
he
had
not
even
entrapped
eyrecourt
into
revealing
the
marriage
engagement
her
unconquerable
had
foiled
him
at
every
point
even
when
he
had
deliberately
kept
his
seat
after
the
other
guests
at
the
had
taken
their
departure
she
rose
with
the
most
imperturbable
coolness
and
left
him
i
have
a
dinner
and
two
parties
and
this
is
just
the
time
when
i
take
my
little
restorative
nap
forgive
me
and
do
come
again
when
he
sent
the
fatal
announcement
of
the
marriage
to
rome
he
had
been
obliged
to
confess
that
he
was
indebted
for
the
discovery
to
the
newspaper
he
had
accepted
the
humiliation
he
had
accepted
the
defeat
but
he
was
not
beaten
yet
i
counted
on
romayne
s
weakness
and
miss
eyrecourt
counted
on
romayne
s
weakness
and
miss
eyrecourt
has
won
so
let
it
be
my
turn
will
in
that
manner
he
had
reconciled
himself
to
his
position
and
now
he
knew
it
when
he
handed
back
the
letter
to
romayne
his
turn
come
you
can
hardly
go
to
paris
to
consult
the
book
he
said
in
the
present
state
of
eyrecourt
s
health
certainly
not
perhaps
you
will
send
somebody
to
search
the
catalogue
at
the
british
museum
i
should
have
done
that
already
father
benwell
but
for
the
very
kind
allusion
in
your
note
to
your
friend
in
the
country
even
if
the
book
is
in
the
museum
library
i
shall
be
obliged
to
go
to
the
reading
room
to
get
my
information
it
would
be
far
more
convenient
to
me
to
have
the
volume
at
home
to
consult
if
you
think
your
friend
will
trust
me
with
i
am
certain
he
will
trust
you
with
it
my
friend
is
winterfield
of
beaupark
house
north
devon
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
of
him
no
the
name
is
quite
new
to
then
come
and
see
the
man
himself
he
is
now
in
london
and
i
am
entirely
at
your
in
half
an
hour
more
romayne
was
presented
to
a
amiable
gentleman
in
the
prime
of
life
smoking
and
reading
the
newspaper
the
bowl
of
his
long
pipe
rested
on
the
floor
on
one
side
of
him
and
a
handsome
red
and
white
spaniel
reposed
on
the
other
before
his
visitors
had
been
two
minutes
in
the
room
he
understood
the
motive
which
had
brought
them
to
consult
him
and
sent
for
a
telegraphic
form
my
steward
will
find
the
book
and
forward
it
to
your
address
by
passenger
train
this
afternoon
he
said
i
will
tell
him
to
put
my
printed
catalogue
of
the
library
into
the
parcel
in
case
i
have
any
other
books
which
may
be
of
use
to
with
those
words
he
dispatched
the
telegram
to
the
office
romayne
attempted
to
make
his
acknowledgments
winterfield
would
hear
no
acknowledgments
my
dear
sir
he
said
with
a
smile
that
brightened
his
whole
face
you
are
engaged
in
writing
a
great
historical
work
and
i
am
an
obscure
country
gentleman
who
is
lucky
enough
to
associate
himself
with
the
production
of
a
new
book
how
do
you
know
that
i
am
not
looking
forward
to
a
complimentary
line
in
the
preface
i
am
the
obliged
person
not
you
pray
consider
me
as
a
handy
little
boy
who
runs
on
errands
for
the
muse
of
history
do
you
smoke
not
even
tobacco
would
soothe
romayne
s
wasted
and
irritable
nerves
father
benwell
all
things
to
all
men
cheerfully
accepted
a
cigar
from
the
box
on
the
table
father
benwell
possesses
all
the
social
virtues
winterfield
ran
on
he
shall
have
his
coffee
and
the
largest
that
the
hotel
can
produce
i
can
quite
understand
that
your
literary
labors
have
tried
your
nerves
he
said
to
romayne
when
he
had
ordered
the
coffee
the
mere
title
of
your
work
overwhelms
an
idle
man
like
me
the
origin
of
religions
what
an
immense
subject
how
far
must
we
look
back
to
find
out
the
first
worshipers
of
the
human
family
where
are
the
hieroglyphics
romayne
that
will
give
you
the
earliest
information
in
the
unknown
center
of
africa
or
among
the
ruined
cities
of
yucatan
my
own
idea
as
an
ignorant
man
is
that
the
first
of
all
forms
of
worship
must
have
been
the
worship
of
the
sun
don
t
be
shocked
father
benwell
i
confess
i
have
a
certain
sympathy
with
in
the
east
especially
the
rising
of
the
sun
is
surely
the
grandest
of
all
objects
the
visible
symbol
of
a
beneficent
deity
who
gives
life
warmth
and
light
to
the
world
of
his
very
grand
no
doubt
remarked
father
benwell
sweetening
his
coffee
but
not
to
be
compared
with
the
noble
sight
at
rome
when
the
pope
blesses
the
christian
world
from
the
balcony
of
peter
so
much
for
professional
feeling
said
winterfield
but
surely
something
depends
on
what
sort
of
man
the
pope
is
if
we
had
lived
in
the
time
of
alexander
the
sixth
would
you
have
called
a
part
of
that
noble
sight
certainly
at
a
proper
distance
father
benwell
briskly
replied
ah
you
heretics
only
know
the
worst
side
of
that
most
unhappy
pontiff
winterfield
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
felt
privately
the
truest
i
should
require
very
good
evidence
to
persuade
me
of
this
touched
romayne
on
a
sad
side
of
his
own
personal
experience
perhaps
he
said
you
don
t
believe
in
remorse
pardon
me
winterfield
rejoined
i
only
distinguish
between
false
remorse
and
true
remorse
we
will
say
no
more
of
alexander
the
sixth
father
benwell
if
we
want
an
illustration
i
will
supply
it
and
give
no
offense
true
remorse
depends
to
my
mind
on
a
man
s
accurate
knowledge
of
his
own
motives
far
from
a
common
knowledge
in
my
experience
say
for
instance
that
i
have
committed
some
serious
offense
romayne
could
not
resist
interrupting
him
say
you
have
killed
one
of
your
he
suggested
very
well
if
i
know
that
i
really
meant
to
kill
him
for
some
vile
purpose
of
my
own
and
if
which
by
no
means
always
follows
i
am
really
capable
of
feeling
the
enormity
of
my
own
crime
that
is
as
i
think
true
remorse
murderer
as
i
am
i
have
in
that
case
some
moral
worth
still
left
in
me
but
if
i
did
mean
to
kill
the
man
if
his
death
was
my
misfortune
as
well
as
his
and
if
as
frequently
happens
i
am
nevertheless
troubled
by
remorse
the
true
cause
lies
in
my
own
inability
fairly
to
realize
my
own
motives
before
i
look
to
results
i
am
the
ignorant
victim
of
false
remorse
and
if
i
will
only
ask
myself
boldly
what
has
blinded
me
to
the
true
state
of
the
case
i
shall
find
the
mischief
due
to
that
misdirected
appreciation
of
my
own
importance
which
is
nothing
but
egotism
in
i
entirely
agree
with
you
said
father
benwell
i
have
had
occasion
to
say
the
same
thing
in
the
winterfield
looked
at
his
dog
and
changed
the
subject
do
you
like
dogs
romayne
he
asked
i
see
my
spaniel
s
eyes
saying
that
he
likes
you
and
his
tail
begging
you
to
take
some
notice
of
romayne
caressed
the
dog
rather
absently
his
new
friend
had
unconsciously
presented
to
him
a
new
view
of
the
darker
aspect
of
his
own
life
winterfield
s
refined
pleasant
manners
his
generous
readiness
in
placing
the
treasures
of
his
library
at
a
stranger
s
disposal
had
already
appealed
irresistibly
to
romayne
s
sensitive
nature
the
favorable
impression
was
now
greatly
strengthened
by
the
briefly
bold
treatment
which
he
had
just
heard
of
a
subject
in
which
he
was
seriously
interested
i
must
see
more
of
this
man
was
his
thought
as
he
patted
the
companionable
spaniel
father
benwell
s
trained
observation
followed
the
vivid
changes
of
expression
on
romayne
s
face
and
marked
the
eager
look
in
his
eyes
as
he
lifted
his
head
from
the
dog
to
the
dog
s
master
the
priest
saw
his
opportunity
and
took
it
do
you
remain
long
at
ten
acres
lodge
he
said
to
romayne
i
hardly
know
as
yet
we
have
no
other
plans
at
you
inherit
the
place
i
think
from
your
late
aunt
lady
berrick
the
tone
of
the
reply
was
not
encouraging
romayne
felt
no
interest
in
talking
of
ten
acres
lodge
father
benwell
persisted
i
was
told
by
eyrecourt
he
went
on
that
lady
berrick
had
some
fine
pictures
are
they
still
at
the
lodge
certainly
i
couldn
t
live
in
a
house
without
father
benwell
looked
at
winterfield
another
taste
in
common
between
you
and
romayne
he
said
besides
your
liking
for
this
at
once
produced
the
desired
result
romayne
eagerly
invited
winterfield
to
see
his
pictures
there
are
not
many
of
them
he
said
but
they
are
really
worth
looking
at
when
will
you
come
the
sooner
the
better
winterfield
answered
cordially
will
do
by
the
noonday
light
whenever
you
please
your
time
is
among
his
other
accomplishments
father
benwell
was
a
if
his
thoughts
at
that
moment
had
been
expressed
in
language
they
would
have
said
check
to
the
chapter
iv
the
end
of
the
honeymoon
on
the
next
morning
winterfield
arrived
alone
at
romayne
s
house
having
been
included
as
a
matter
of
course
in
the
invitation
to
see
the
pictures
father
benwell
had
made
an
excuse
and
had
asked
leave
to
defer
the
proposed
visit
from
his
point
of
view
he
had
nothing
further
to
gain
by
being
present
at
a
second
meeting
between
the
two
men
in
the
absence
of
stella
he
had
it
on
romayne
s
own
authority
that
she
was
in
constant
attendance
on
her
mother
and
that
her
husband
was
alone
either
eyrecourt
will
get
better
or
she
will
die
father
benwell
reasoned
i
shall
make
constant
inquiries
after
her
health
and
in
either
case
i
shall
know
when
romayne
returns
to
ten
acres
lodge
after
that
domestic
event
the
next
time
winterfield
visits
romayne
i
shall
go
and
see
the
it
is
one
of
the
defects
of
a
intellect
to
trust
too
implicitly
to
calculation
and
to
leave
nothing
to
chance
once
or
twice
already
father
benwell
had
been
in
the
popular
phrase
a
little
too
clever
and
chance
had
thrown
him
out
as
events
happened
chance
was
destined
to
throw
him
out
once
more
of
the
most
modest
pretensions
in
regard
to
numbers
and
size
the
pictures
collected
by
the
late
lady
berrick
were
masterly
works
of
modern
art
with
few
exceptions
they
had
been
produced
by
the
matchless
english
landscape
painters
of
half
a
century
since
there
was
no
formal
gallery
here
the
pictures
were
so
few
that
they
could
be
hung
in
excellent
lights
in
the
different
of
the
villa
turner
constable
collins
danby
callcott
linnell
the
master
of
beaupark
house
passed
from
one
to
the
other
with
the
enjoyment
of
a
man
who
thoroughly
appreciated
the
truest
and
finest
landscape
art
that
the
world
has
yet
seen
you
had
better
not
have
asked
me
here
he
said
to
romayne
in
his
quaintly
way
i
can
t
part
with
those
pictures
when
i
say
you
will
find
me
calling
here
again
and
again
till
you
are
perfectly
sick
of
me
look
at
this
sea
piece
who
thinks
of
the
brushes
and
palette
of
painter
there
truth
to
nature
and
poetical
feeling
go
hand
in
hand
together
it
is
absolutely
lovely
i
could
kiss
that
they
were
in
romayne
s
study
when
this
odd
outburst
of
enthusiasm
escaped
winterfield
he
happened
to
look
toward
the
next
some
pages
of
manuscript
blotted
and
interlined
with
corrections
at
once
attracted
his
attention
is
that
the
forthcoming
history
he
asked
you
are
not
one
of
the
authors
who
perform
the
process
of
correction
mentally
you
revise
and
improve
with
the
pen
in
your
romayne
looked
at
him
in
surprise
i
suspect
winterfield
you
have
used
your
pen
for
other
purposes
than
writing
no
indeed
you
pay
me
an
undeserved
compliment
when
you
come
to
see
me
in
devonshire
i
can
show
you
some
manuscripts
and
corrected
proofs
left
by
our
great
writers
collected
by
my
father
my
knowledge
of
the
secrets
of
the
craft
has
been
gained
by
examining
those
literary
treasures
if
the
public
only
knew
that
every
writer
worthy
of
the
name
is
the
severest
critic
of
his
own
book
before
it
ever
gets
into
the
hands
of
the
reviewers
how
surprised
they
would
be
the
man
who
has
worked
in
the
full
fervor
of
composition
yesterday
is
the
same
man
who
sits
in
severe
and
merciless
judgment
on
what
he
has
himself
produced
what
a
fascination
there
must
be
in
the
art
which
exacts
and
receives
such
double
labor
as
this
romayne
thought
not
unkindly
of
his
wife
stella
had
once
asked
him
how
long
a
time
he
was
usually
occupied
in
writing
one
page
the
reply
had
filled
her
with
pity
and
wonder
why
do
you
take
all
that
trouble
she
had
gently
remonstrated
it
would
be
just
the
same
to
the
people
darling
if
you
did
it
in
half
the
by
way
of
changing
the
topic
romayne
led
his
visitor
into
another
room
i
have
a
picture
here
he
said
which
belongs
to
a
newer
school
of
painting
you
have
been
talking
of
hard
work
in
one
art
there
it
is
in
yes
said
winterfield
there
it
is
the
misdirected
hard
work
which
has
been
guided
by
no
critical
faculty
and
which
doesn
t
know
where
to
stop
i
try
to
admire
it
and
i
end
in
pitying
the
poor
artist
look
at
that
leafless
felled
tree
in
the
middle
distance
every
little
twig
on
the
smallest
branch
is
conscientiously
painted
and
the
result
is
like
a
colored
photograph
you
don
t
look
at
a
landscape
as
a
series
of
separate
parts
you
don
t
discover
every
twig
on
a
tree
you
see
the
whole
in
nature
and
you
want
to
see
the
whole
in
a
picture
that
canvas
presents
a
triumph
of
patience
and
pains
produced
exactly
as
a
piece
of
embroidery
is
produced
all
in
little
separate
bits
worked
with
the
same
mechanically
complete
care
i
turn
away
from
it
to
your
shrubbery
there
with
an
ungrateful
sense
of
he
walked
to
the
window
as
he
spoke
it
looked
out
on
the
grounds
in
front
of
the
house
at
the
same
moment
the
noise
of
rolling
wheels
became
audible
on
the
drive
an
open
carriage
appeared
at
the
turn
in
the
road
winterfield
called
romayne
to
the
window
a
visitor
he
began
and
suddenly
drew
back
without
saying
a
word
more
romayne
looked
out
and
recognized
his
wife
excuse
me
for
one
moment
he
said
it
is
on
that
morning
an
improvement
in
the
fluctuating
state
of
eyrecourt
s
health
had
given
stella
another
of
those
opportunities
of
passing
an
hour
or
two
with
her
husband
which
she
so
highly
prized
romayne
withdrew
to
meet
her
at
the
door
too
hurriedly
to
notice
winterfield
standing
in
the
corner
to
which
he
had
retreated
like
a
man
petrified
stella
had
got
out
of
the
carriage
when
her
husband
reached
the
porch
she
ascended
the
few
steps
that
led
to
the
hall
as
slowly
and
painfully
as
if
she
had
been
an
infirm
old
woman
the
delicately
tinted
color
in
her
face
had
faded
to
an
ashy
white
she
had
seen
winterfield
at
the
window
for
the
moment
romayne
looked
at
her
in
speechless
consternation
he
led
her
into
the
nearest
room
that
opened
out
of
the
hall
and
took
her
in
his
arms
my
love
this
nursing
of
your
mother
has
completely
broken
you
down
he
said
with
the
tenderest
pity
for
her
if
you
won
t
think
of
yourself
you
must
think
of
me
for
my
sake
remain
here
and
take
the
rest
that
you
need
i
will
be
a
tyrant
stella
for
the
first
time
i
won
t
let
you
go
she
roused
herself
and
tried
to
smile
and
hid
the
sad
result
from
him
in
a
kiss
i
do
feel
the
anxiety
and
fatigue
she
said
but
my
mother
is
really
improving
and
if
it
only
continues
the
blessed
sense
of
relief
will
make
me
strong
she
paused
and
roused
all
her
courage
in
anticipation
of
the
next
words
so
trivial
and
so
terrible
that
must
sooner
or
later
be
pronounced
you
have
a
visitor
she
said
did
you
see
him
at
the
window
a
really
delightful
man
i
know
you
will
like
him
under
any
other
circumstances
i
should
have
introduced
him
you
are
not
well
enough
to
see
strangers
she
was
too
determined
to
prevent
winterfield
from
ever
entering
the
house
again
to
shrink
from
the
meeting
i
am
not
so
ill
as
you
think
lewis
she
said
bravely
when
you
go
to
your
new
friend
i
will
go
with
you
i
am
a
little
tired
that
s
romayne
looked
at
her
anxiously
let
me
get
you
a
glass
of
wine
he
said
she
consented
she
really
felt
the
need
of
it
as
he
turned
away
to
ring
the
bell
she
put
the
question
which
had
been
in
her
mind
from
the
moment
when
she
had
seen
winterfield
how
did
you
become
acquainted
with
this
gentleman
through
father
she
was
not
surprised
by
the
answer
her
suspicion
of
the
priest
had
remained
in
her
mind
from
the
night
of
lady
loring
s
ball
the
future
of
her
married
life
depended
on
her
capacity
to
check
the
growing
intimacy
between
the
two
men
in
that
conviction
she
found
the
courage
to
face
winterfield
how
should
she
meet
him
the
impulse
of
the
moment
pointed
to
the
shortest
way
out
of
the
dreadful
position
in
which
she
was
placed
it
was
to
treat
him
like
a
stranger
she
drank
her
glass
of
wine
and
took
romayne
s
arm
we
mustn
t
keep
your
friend
waiting
any
longer
she
resumed
come
as
they
crossed
the
hall
she
looked
suspiciously
toward
the
house
door
had
he
taken
the
opportunity
of
leaving
the
villa
at
any
other
time
she
would
have
remembered
that
the
plainest
laws
of
good
breeding
compelled
him
to
wait
for
romayne
s
return
his
own
knowledge
of
the
world
would
tell
him
that
an
act
of
gross
rudeness
committed
by
a
man
would
inevitably
excite
suspicion
of
some
unworthy
motive
and
might
perhaps
connect
that
motive
with
her
unexpected
appearance
at
the
house
romayne
opened
the
door
and
they
entered
the
room
together
mr
winterfield
let
me
introduce
you
to
they
bowed
to
each
other
they
spoke
the
conventional
words
proper
to
the
occasion
but
the
effort
that
it
cost
them
showed
itself
romayne
perceived
an
unusual
formality
in
his
wife
s
manner
and
a
strange
disappearance
of
winterfield
s
easy
grace
of
address
was
he
one
of
the
few
men
in
these
days
who
are
shy
in
the
presence
of
women
and
was
the
change
in
stella
attributable
perhaps
to
the
state
of
her
health
the
explanation
might
in
either
case
be
the
right
one
he
tried
to
set
them
at
their
ease
mr
winterfield
is
so
pleased
with
the
pictures
that
he
means
to
come
and
see
them
again
he
said
to
his
wife
and
one
of
his
favorites
happens
to
be
your
favorite
she
tried
to
look
at
winterfield
but
her
eyes
sank
she
could
turn
toward
him
and
that
was
all
is
it
the
in
the
study
she
said
to
him
faintly
yes
he
answered
with
formal
politeness
it
seems
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
painter
s
finest
romayne
looked
at
him
in
unconcealed
wonder
to
what
flat
commonplace
winterfield
s
lively
enthusiasm
had
sunk
in
stella
s
presence
she
perceived
that
some
unfavorable
impression
had
been
produced
on
her
husband
and
interposed
with
a
timely
suggestion
her
motive
was
not
only
to
divert
romayne
s
attention
from
winterfield
but
to
give
him
a
reason
for
leaving
the
room
the
little
drawing
in
my
bedroom
is
by
the
same
artist
she
said
mr
winterfield
might
like
to
see
it
if
you
will
ring
the
bell
lewis
i
will
send
my
maid
for
romayne
had
never
allowed
the
servants
to
touch
his
works
of
art
since
the
day
when
a
zealous
housemaid
had
tried
to
wash
one
of
his
plaster
casts
he
made
the
reply
which
his
wife
had
anticipated
no
no
he
said
i
will
fetch
the
drawing
he
turned
gayly
to
winterfield
prepare
yourself
for
another
work
that
you
would
like
to
he
smiled
and
left
the
room
the
instant
the
door
was
closed
stella
approached
winterfield
her
beautiful
face
became
distorted
by
a
mingled
expression
of
rage
and
contempt
she
spoke
to
him
in
a
fierce
peremptory
whisper
have
you
any
consideration
for
me
left
his
look
at
her
as
she
put
that
question
revealed
the
most
complete
contrast
between
his
face
and
hers
compassionate
sorrow
was
in
his
eyes
tender
forbearance
and
respect
spoke
in
his
tones
as
he
answered
her
i
have
more
than
consideration
for
you
stella
she
angrily
interrupted
him
how
dare
you
call
me
by
my
christian
name
he
remonstrated
with
a
gentleness
that
might
have
touched
the
heart
of
any
woman
do
you
still
refuse
to
believe
that
i
never
deceived
you
has
time
not
softened
your
heart
to
me
yet
she
was
more
contemptuous
toward
him
than
ever
spare
me
your
protestations
she
said
i
heard
enough
of
them
two
years
since
will
you
do
what
i
ask
of
you
you
know
that
i
put
an
end
to
your
acquaintance
with
my
husband
put
an
end
to
it
she
repeated
vehemently
from
this
day
at
once
and
forever
can
i
trust
you
to
do
it
do
you
think
i
would
have
entered
this
house
if
i
had
known
he
was
your
husband
he
made
that
reply
with
a
sudden
change
in
him
with
a
rising
color
and
in
firm
tones
of
indignation
in
a
moment
more
his
voice
softened
again
and
his
kind
blue
eyes
rested
on
her
sadly
and
devotedly
you
may
trust
me
to
do
more
than
you
ask
he
resumed
you
have
made
a
what
mistake
when
romayne
introduced
us
you
met
me
like
a
stranger
and
you
left
me
no
choice
but
to
do
as
you
i
wish
you
to
be
a
her
sharpest
replies
made
no
change
in
his
manner
he
spoke
as
kindly
and
as
patiently
as
ever
you
forget
that
you
and
your
mother
were
my
guests
at
beaupark
two
years
ago
stella
understood
what
he
meant
and
more
in
an
instant
she
remembered
that
father
benwell
had
been
at
beaupark
house
had
he
heard
of
the
visit
she
clasped
her
hands
in
speechless
terror
winterfield
gently
reassured
her
you
must
not
be
frightened
he
said
it
is
in
the
last
degree
unlikely
that
romayne
will
ever
find
out
that
you
were
at
my
house
if
he
does
and
if
you
deny
it
i
will
do
for
you
what
i
would
do
for
no
other
human
creature
i
will
deny
it
too
you
are
safe
from
discovery
be
happy
and
forget
for
the
first
time
she
showed
signs
of
relenting
she
turned
her
head
away
and
sighed
although
her
mind
was
full
of
the
serious
necessity
of
warning
him
against
father
benwell
she
had
not
even
command
enough
over
her
own
voice
to
ask
how
he
had
become
acquainted
with
the
priest
his
manly
devotion
the
perfect
and
pathetic
sincerity
of
his
respect
pleaded
with
her
in
spite
of
herself
for
a
moment
she
paused
to
recover
her
composure
in
that
moment
romayne
returned
to
them
with
the
drawing
in
his
hand
there
he
said
it
s
nothing
this
time
but
some
children
gathering
flowers
on
the
outskirts
of
a
wood
what
do
you
think
of
it
what
i
thought
of
the
larger
work
winterfield
answered
i
could
look
at
it
by
the
hour
he
consulted
his
watch
but
time
is
a
hard
master
and
tells
me
that
my
visit
must
come
to
an
end
thank
you
most
he
bowed
to
stella
romayne
thought
his
guest
might
have
taken
the
english
freedom
of
shaking
hands
when
will
you
come
and
look
at
the
pictures
again
he
asked
will
you
dine
with
us
and
see
how
they
bear
the
lamplight
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
must
beg
you
to
excuse
me
my
plans
are
altered
since
we
met
yesterday
i
am
obliged
to
leave
romayne
was
unwilling
to
part
with
him
on
these
terms
you
will
let
me
know
when
you
are
next
in
town
he
said
certainly
with
that
short
answer
he
hurried
away
romayne
waited
a
little
in
the
hall
before
he
went
back
to
his
wife
stella
s
reception
of
winterfield
though
not
positively
ungracious
was
nevertheless
the
reverse
of
encouraging
what
extraordinary
caprice
had
made
her
insensible
to
the
social
attractions
of
a
man
so
unaffectedly
agreeable
it
was
not
wonderful
that
winterfield
s
cordiality
should
have
been
chilled
by
the
cold
welcome
that
he
had
received
from
the
mistress
of
the
house
at
the
same
time
some
allowance
was
to
be
made
for
the
influence
of
stella
s
domestic
anxieties
and
some
sympathy
was
claimed
by
the
state
of
her
health
although
her
husband
shrank
from
distressing
her
by
any
immediate
reference
to
her
reception
of
his
friend
he
could
not
disguise
from
himself
that
she
had
disappointed
him
when
he
went
back
to
the
room
stella
was
lying
on
the
sofa
with
her
face
turned
toward
the
wall
she
was
in
tears
and
she
was
afraid
to
let
him
see
it
i
won
t
disturb
you
he
said
and
withdrew
to
his
study
the
precious
volume
which
winterfield
had
so
kindly
placed
at
his
disposal
was
on
the
table
waiting
for
him
father
benwell
had
lost
little
by
not
being
present
at
the
introduction
of
winterfield
to
stella
he
had
witnessed
a
plainer
betrayal
of
emotion
when
they
met
unexpectedly
in
lord
loring
s
picture
gallery
but
if
he
had
seen
romayne
reading
in
his
study
and
stella
crying
secretly
on
the
sofa
he
might
have
written
to
rome
by
that
day
s
post
and
might
have
announced
that
he
had
sown
the
first
seeds
of
disunion
between
husband
and
wife
chapter
father
benwell
s
correspondence
the
secretary
in
my
last
few
hasty
lines
i
was
only
able
to
inform
you
of
the
unexpected
arrival
of
romayne
while
winterfield
was
visiting
her
husband
if
you
remember
i
warned
you
not
to
attach
any
undue
importance
to
my
absence
on
that
occasion
my
present
report
will
satisfy
my
reverend
brethren
that
the
interests
committed
to
me
are
as
safe
as
ever
in
my
hands
i
have
paid
three
visits
at
certain
intervals
the
first
to
winterfield
briefly
mentioned
in
my
last
letter
the
second
to
romayne
the
third
to
the
invalid
lady
eyrecourt
in
every
case
i
have
been
rewarded
by
important
results
we
will
revert
to
winterfield
first
i
found
him
at
his
hotel
enveloped
in
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
having
led
him
with
some
difficulty
into
talking
of
his
visit
to
ten
acres
lodge
i
asked
how
he
liked
romayne
s
pictures
i
envy
him
his
that
was
the
only
answer
and
how
do
you
like
romayne
i
inquired
next
he
laid
down
his
pipe
and
looked
at
me
attentively
my
face
i
flatter
myself
defied
discovery
he
inhaled
another
mouthful
of
tobacco
and
began
to
play
with
his
dog
if
i
must
answer
your
question
he
burst
out
suddenly
i
didn
t
get
a
very
gracious
reception
from
there
he
abruptly
stopped
he
is
a
thoroughly
transparent
man
you
see
straight
into
his
mind
through
his
eyes
i
perceived
that
he
was
only
telling
me
a
part
perhaps
a
very
small
part
of
the
truth
can
you
account
for
such
a
reception
as
you
describe
i
asked
he
answered
shortly
perhaps
i
can
account
for
it
i
went
on
did
romayne
tell
his
wife
that
i
was
the
means
of
introducing
you
to
him
he
fixed
another
searching
look
on
me
mr
romayne
might
have
said
so
when
he
left
me
to
receive
his
wife
at
the
in
that
case
winterfield
the
explanation
is
as
plain
as
the
sun
at
noonday
romayne
is
a
strong
protestant
and
i
am
a
catholic
he
accepted
this
method
of
accounting
for
his
reception
with
an
alacrity
that
would
not
have
imposed
on
a
child
you
see
i
had
relieved
him
from
all
further
necessity
of
accounting
for
the
conduct
of
romayne
a
lady
s
religious
prejudices
i
proceeded
in
the
friendliest
way
are
never
taken
seriously
by
a
sensible
man
you
have
placed
romayne
under
obligations
to
your
kindness
he
is
eager
to
improve
his
acquaintance
with
you
you
will
go
again
to
ten
acres
lodge
he
gave
me
another
short
answer
i
think
i
said
i
was
sorry
to
hear
it
however
i
added
you
can
always
see
him
here
when
you
are
in
he
puffed
out
a
big
volume
of
smoke
and
made
no
remark
i
declined
to
be
put
down
by
silence
and
smoke
or
perhaps
i
persisted
you
will
honor
me
by
meeting
him
at
a
simple
little
dinner
at
my
lodgings
being
a
gentleman
he
was
of
course
obliged
to
answer
this
he
said
you
are
very
kind
i
would
rather
not
shall
we
talk
of
something
else
father
benwell
we
talked
of
something
else
he
was
just
as
amiable
as
ever
but
he
was
not
in
good
spirits
i
think
i
shall
run
over
to
paris
before
the
end
of
the
month
he
said
to
make
a
long
stay
i
asked
oh
no
call
in
a
week
or
ten
days
and
you
will
find
me
here
when
i
got
up
to
go
he
returned
of
his
own
accord
to
the
forbidden
subject
he
said
i
must
beg
you
to
do
me
two
favors
the
first
is
not
to
let
romayne
know
that
i
am
still
in
london
the
second
is
not
to
ask
me
for
any
the
result
of
our
interview
may
be
stated
in
very
few
words
it
has
advanced
me
one
step
nearer
to
discovery
winterfield
s
voice
look
and
manner
satisfied
me
of
this
the
true
motive
for
his
sudden
change
of
feeling
toward
romayne
is
jealousy
of
the
man
who
has
married
miss
eyrecourt
those
compromising
circumstances
which
baffled
the
inquiries
of
my
agent
are
associated
in
plain
english
with
a
love
affair
remember
all
that
i
have
told
you
of
romayne
s
peculiar
disposition
and
imagine
if
you
can
what
the
consequences
of
such
a
disclosure
will
be
when
we
are
in
a
position
to
enlighten
the
master
of
vange
abbey
as
to
the
present
relations
between
the
husband
and
wife
i
have
only
to
tell
you
next
what
passed
when
i
visited
romayne
a
day
or
two
later
i
did
well
to
keep
penrose
at
our
disposal
we
shall
want
him
again
on
arriving
at
ten
acres
lodge
i
found
romayne
in
his
study
his
manuscript
lay
before
him
but
he
was
not
at
work
he
looked
worn
and
haggard
to
this
day
i
don
t
know
from
what
precise
nervous
malady
he
suffers
i
could
only
guess
that
it
had
been
troubling
him
again
since
he
and
i
last
met
my
first
conventional
civilities
were
dedicated
of
course
to
his
wife
she
is
still
in
attendance
on
her
mother
eyrecourt
is
now
considered
to
be
out
of
danger
but
the
good
lady
who
is
ready
enough
to
recommend
doctors
to
other
people
persists
in
thinking
that
she
is
too
robust
a
person
to
require
medical
help
herself
the
physician
in
attendance
trusts
entirely
to
her
daughter
to
persuade
her
to
persevere
with
the
necessary
course
of
medicine
don
t
suppose
that
i
trouble
you
by
mentioning
these
trumpery
circumstances
without
a
reason
we
shall
have
occasion
to
return
to
eyrecourt
and
her
doctor
before
i
had
been
five
minutes
in
his
company
romayne
asked
me
if
i
had
seen
winterfield
since
his
visit
to
ten
acres
lodge
i
said
i
had
seen
him
and
waited
anticipating
the
next
question
romayne
fulfilled
my
expectations
he
inquired
if
winterfield
had
left
london
there
are
certain
cases
as
i
am
told
by
medical
authorities
in
which
the
dangerous
system
of
bleeding
a
patient
still
has
its
advantages
there
are
other
cases
in
which
the
dangerous
system
of
telling
the
truth
becomes
equally
judicious
i
said
to
romayne
if
i
answer
you
honestly
will
you
consider
it
as
strictly
confidential
winterfield
i
regret
to
say
has
no
intention
of
improving
his
acquaintance
with
you
he
asked
me
to
conceal
from
you
that
he
is
still
in
romayne
s
face
plainly
betrayed
that
he
was
annoyed
and
irritated
nothing
that
you
say
to
me
father
benwell
shall
pass
the
walls
of
this
room
he
replied
did
winterfield
give
any
reason
for
not
continuing
his
acquaintance
with
me
i
told
the
truth
once
more
with
courteous
expressions
of
regret
mr
winterfield
spoke
of
an
ungracious
reception
on
the
part
of
he
started
to
his
feet
and
walked
irritably
up
and
down
the
room
it
is
beyond
endurance
he
said
to
himself
the
truth
had
served
its
purpose
by
this
time
i
affected
not
to
have
heard
him
did
you
speak
to
me
i
asked
he
used
a
milder
form
of
expression
it
is
most
unfortunate
he
said
i
must
immediately
send
back
the
valuable
book
which
winterfield
has
lent
to
me
and
that
is
not
the
worst
of
it
there
are
other
volumes
in
his
library
which
i
have
the
greatest
interest
in
consulting
and
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
borrow
them
now
at
this
time
too
when
i
have
lost
penrose
i
had
hoped
to
find
in
winterfield
another
friend
who
sympathized
with
my
pursuits
there
is
something
so
cheering
and
attractive
in
his
manner
and
he
has
just
the
boldness
and
novelty
of
view
in
his
opinions
that
appeal
to
a
man
like
me
it
was
a
pleasant
future
to
look
forward
to
and
it
must
be
sacrificed
and
to
what
to
a
woman
s
from
our
point
of
view
this
was
a
frame
of
mind
to
be
encouraged
i
tried
the
experiment
of
modestly
taking
the
blame
on
myself
i
suggested
that
i
might
be
quite
innocently
answerable
for
romayne
s
disappointment
he
looked
at
me
thoroughly
puzzled
i
repeated
what
i
had
said
to
winterfield
did
you
mention
to
romayne
that
i
was
the
means
of
introducing
you
he
was
too
impatient
to
let
me
finish
the
sentence
i
did
mention
it
to
romayne
he
said
and
what
of
it
pardon
me
for
reminding
you
that
romayne
has
protestant
prejudices
i
rejoined
mr
winterfield
would
i
fear
not
be
very
welcome
to
her
as
the
friend
of
a
catholic
he
was
almost
angry
with
me
for
suggesting
the
very
explanation
which
had
proved
so
acceptable
to
winterfield
nonsense
he
cried
my
wife
is
far
too
a
woman
to
let
her
prejudices
express
themselves
in
way
winterfield
s
personal
appearance
must
have
inspired
her
with
some
unreasonable
antipathy
or
he
stopped
and
turned
away
thoughtfully
to
the
window
some
vague
suspicion
had
probably
entered
his
mind
which
he
had
only
become
aware
of
at
that
moment
and
which
he
was
not
quite
able
to
realize
as
yet
i
did
my
best
to
encourage
the
new
train
of
thought
what
other
reason
there
be
i
asked
he
turned
on
me
sharply
i
don
t
know
do
you
i
ventured
on
a
courteous
remonstrance
my
dear
sir
if
you
can
t
find
another
reason
how
can
i
it
must
have
been
a
sudden
antipathy
as
you
say
such
things
do
happen
between
strangers
i
suppose
i
am
right
in
assuming
that
romayne
and
winterfield
are
strangers
his
eyes
flashed
with
a
sudden
sinister
brightness
the
new
idea
had
caught
light
in
his
mind
they
as
strangers
he
said
there
he
stopped
again
and
returned
to
the
window
i
felt
that
i
might
lose
the
place
i
had
gained
in
his
confidence
if
i
pressed
the
subject
any
further
besides
i
had
my
reasons
for
saying
a
word
about
penrose
next
as
it
happened
i
had
received
a
letter
from
him
relating
to
his
present
employment
and
sending
kindest
regards
to
his
dear
friend
and
master
in
the
postscript
i
gave
the
message
romayne
looked
round
with
an
instant
change
in
his
face
the
mere
sound
of
penrose
s
name
seemed
to
act
as
a
relief
to
the
gloom
and
suspicion
that
had
oppressed
him
the
moment
before
you
don
t
know
how
i
miss
the
dear
gentle
little
fellow
he
said
sadly
why
not
write
to
him
i
suggested
he
would
be
so
glad
to
hear
from
you
i
don
t
know
where
to
did
i
not
send
you
his
address
when
i
forwarded
your
letter
to
him
then
let
me
atone
for
my
forgetfulness
at
i
wrote
down
the
address
and
took
my
leave
as
i
approached
the
door
i
noticed
on
a
side
table
the
catholic
volumes
which
penrose
left
with
romayne
one
of
them
was
open
with
a
pencil
lying
beside
it
i
thought
that
a
good
sign
but
i
said
nothing
romayne
pressed
my
hand
at
parting
you
have
been
very
kind
and
friendly
father
benwell
he
said
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
don
t
mention
it
in
quarters
where
it
might
do
me
harm
do
you
know
i
really
pitied
him
he
has
sacrificed
everything
to
his
marriage
and
his
marriage
has
disappointed
him
he
was
even
reduced
to
be
friendly
with
me
of
course
when
the
right
time
comes
i
shall
give
penrose
leave
of
absence
do
you
foresee
as
i
do
the
speedy
return
of
the
dear
gentle
little
fellow
to
his
old
employment
the
resumed
work
of
conversion
advancing
more
rapidly
than
ever
and
the
jealousy
of
the
protestant
wife
aggravating
the
false
position
in
which
she
is
already
placed
by
her
equivocal
reception
of
winterfield
you
may
answer
this
by
reminding
me
of
the
darker
side
of
the
prospect
an
heir
may
be
born
and
the
heir
s
mother
backed
by
general
opinion
may
insist
if
there
is
any
hesitation
in
the
matter
on
asserting
the
boy
s
natural
right
to
succeed
his
father
patience
my
reverend
colleague
there
is
no
threatening
of
any
such
calamity
yet
and
even
if
it
happens
don
t
forget
that
romayne
has
inherited
a
second
fortune
the
vange
estate
has
an
estimated
value
if
the
act
of
restitution
represented
that
value
in
ready
money
do
you
think
the
church
would
discourage
a
good
convert
by
refusing
his
check
you
know
better
than
that
and
so
do
i
the
next
day
i
called
to
inquire
how
eyrecourt
was
getting
on
the
report
was
favorable
three
days
later
i
called
again
the
report
was
still
more
encouraging
i
was
also
informed
that
romayne
had
returned
to
ten
acres
lodge
much
of
my
success
in
life
has
been
achieved
by
never
being
in
a
hurry
i
was
not
in
a
hurry
now
time
sometimes
brings
opportunities
and
opportunities
are
worth
waiting
for
let
me
make
this
clear
by
an
example
a
man
of
headlong
disposition
in
my
place
would
have
probably
spoken
of
miss
eyrecourt
s
marriage
to
romayne
at
his
first
meeting
with
winterfield
and
would
have
excited
their
distrust
and
put
them
respectively
on
their
guard
without
obtaining
any
useful
result
i
can
at
any
time
make
the
disclosure
to
romayne
which
informs
him
that
his
wife
had
been
winterfield
s
guest
in
devonshire
when
she
affected
to
meet
her
former
host
on
the
footing
of
a
stranger
in
the
meanwhile
i
give
penrose
ample
opportunity
for
innocently
widening
the
breach
between
husband
and
wife
you
see
i
hope
that
if
i
maintain
a
passive
position
it
is
not
from
indolence
or
discouragement
now
we
may
get
on
after
an
interval
of
a
few
days
more
i
decided
on
making
further
inquiries
at
eyrecourt
s
house
this
time
when
i
left
my
card
i
sent
a
message
asking
if
the
lady
could
receive
me
shall
i
own
my
weakness
she
possesses
all
the
information
that
i
want
and
she
has
twice
baffled
my
inquiries
under
these
humiliating
circumstances
it
is
part
of
the
priestly
pugnacity
of
my
disposition
to
inquire
again
i
was
invited
to
go
upstairs
the
front
and
back
of
the
house
were
thrown
into
one
eyrecourt
was
being
gently
moved
backward
and
forward
in
a
chair
on
wheels
propelled
by
her
maid
two
gentlemen
being
present
visitors
like
myself
in
spite
of
rouge
and
loosely
folded
lace
and
flowing
draperies
she
presented
a
deplorable
spectacle
the
bodily
part
of
her
looked
like
a
dead
woman
painted
and
revived
while
the
moral
part
in
the
strongest
contrast
was
just
as
lively
as
ever
so
glad
to
see
you
again
father
benwell
and
so
much
obliged
by
your
kind
inquiries
i
am
quite
well
though
the
doctor
won
t
admit
it
isn
t
it
funny
to
see
me
being
wheeled
about
like
a
child
in
a
perambulator
returning
to
first
principles
i
call
it
you
see
it
s
a
law
of
my
nature
that
i
must
go
about
the
doctor
won
t
let
me
go
about
outside
the
house
so
i
go
about
inside
the
house
matilda
is
the
nurse
and
i
am
the
baby
who
will
learn
to
walk
some
of
these
days
are
you
tired
matilda
no
then
give
me
another
turn
there
s
a
good
creature
movement
perpetual
movement
is
a
law
of
nature
oh
dear
no
doctor
i
didn
t
make
that
discovery
for
myself
some
eminent
scientific
person
mentioned
it
in
a
lecture
the
ugliest
man
i
ever
saw
now
back
again
matilda
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
friends
father
benwell
introducing
is
out
of
fashion
i
know
but
i
am
one
of
the
few
women
who
can
resist
the
tyranny
of
fashion
i
like
introducing
people
sir
john
drone
father
benwell
father
benwell
doctor
wybrow
ah
yes
you
know
the
doctor
by
reputation
shall
i
give
you
his
character
personally
charming
professionally
detestable
pardon
my
impudence
doctor
it
is
one
of
the
consequences
of
the
overflowing
state
of
my
health
another
turn
matilda
and
a
little
faster
this
time
oh
how
i
wish
i
was
traveling
by
railway
there
her
breath
failed
her
she
reclined
in
her
chair
and
fanned
herself
silently
for
a
while
i
was
now
able
to
turn
my
attention
to
the
two
visitors
sir
john
drone
it
was
easy
to
see
would
be
no
obstacle
to
confidential
conversation
with
eyrecourt
an
excellent
country
gentleman
with
the
bald
head
the
ruddy
complexion
and
the
inexhaustible
capacity
for
silence
so
familiar
to
us
in
english
society
there
you
have
the
true
description
of
sir
john
but
the
famous
physician
was
quite
another
sort
of
man
i
had
only
to
look
at
him
and
to
feel
myself
condemned
to
small
talk
while
was
in
the
room
you
have
always
heard
of
it
in
my
correspondence
whenever
i
have
been
in
the
wrong
i
was
in
the
wrong
again
now
i
had
forgotten
the
law
of
chances
capricious
fortune
after
a
long
interval
was
about
to
declare
herself
again
in
my
favor
by
means
of
the
very
woman
who
had
twice
already
got
the
better
of
me
what
a
recompense
for
my
kind
inquiries
after
eyrecourt
she
recovered
breath
enough
to
begin
talking
again
dear
me
how
dull
you
are
she
said
to
us
why
don
t
you
amuse
a
poor
prisoner
confined
to
the
house
rest
a
little
matilda
or
you
will
be
falling
ill
next
doctor
is
this
your
last
professional
visit
promise
to
take
care
of
yourself
eyrecourt
and
i
will
confess
that
the
professional
visits
are
over
i
come
here
only
as
a
you
best
of
men
do
me
another
favor
enliven
our
dullness
tell
us
some
interesting
story
about
a
patient
these
great
doctors
sir
john
pass
their
lives
in
a
perfect
atmosphere
of
romance
wybrow
s
is
like
your
confessional
father
benwell
the
most
fascinating
sins
and
sorrows
are
poured
into
his
ears
what
is
the
last
romance
in
real
life
doctor
that
has
asked
you
to
treat
it
medically
we
don
t
want
names
and
places
we
are
good
children
we
only
want
a
wybrow
looked
at
me
with
a
smile
it
is
impossible
to
persuade
ladies
he
said
that
we
too
are
in
our
way
the
first
duty
of
a
doctor
eyrecourt
is
to
cure
people
of
course
she
interposed
in
her
smartest
manner
the
doctor
answered
seriously
no
indeed
that
is
only
the
second
duty
our
first
duty
is
invariably
to
respect
the
confidence
of
our
patients
however
he
resumed
in
his
easier
tone
i
happen
to
have
seen
a
patient
under
circumstances
which
the
rules
of
professional
honor
do
not
forbid
me
to
mention
i
don
t
know
eyrecourt
whether
you
will
quite
like
to
be
introduced
to
the
scene
of
the
story
the
scene
is
in
a
eyrecourt
burst
out
with
a
coquettish
little
scream
and
shook
her
fan
at
the
doctor
no
horrors
she
cried
the
bare
idea
of
a
madhouse
distracts
me
with
terror
oh
fie
fie
i
won
t
listen
to
you
i
won
t
look
at
you
i
positively
refuse
to
be
frightened
out
of
my
wits
matilda
wheel
me
away
to
the
furthest
end
of
the
room
my
vivid
imagination
father
benwell
is
my
rock
ahead
in
life
i
declare
i
can
the
odious
madhouse
go
straight
to
the
window
matilda
i
want
to
bury
my
nose
among
the
sir
john
upon
this
spoke
for
the
first
time
his
language
consisted
entirely
of
beginnings
of
sentences
mutely
completed
by
a
smile
upon
my
word
you
know
eh
doctor
wybrow
a
man
of
your
experience
horrors
in
madhouses
a
lady
in
delicate
health
no
really
upon
my
honor
now
i
can
not
something
funny
oh
yes
but
such
a
subject
oh
he
rose
to
leave
us
wybrow
gently
stopped
him
i
had
a
motive
sir
john
he
said
but
i
won
t
trouble
you
with
needless
explanations
there
is
a
person
unknown
to
me
whom
i
want
to
discover
you
are
a
great
deal
in
society
when
you
are
in
london
may
i
ask
if
you
have
ever
met
with
a
gentleman
named
winterfield
i
have
always
considered
the
power
of
as
one
of
the
strongest
points
in
my
character
for
the
future
i
shall
be
more
humble
when
i
heard
that
name
my
surprise
so
completely
mastered
me
that
i
sat
to
wybrow
as
the
man
who
could
answer
his
question
in
the
meanwhile
sir
john
took
his
time
to
consider
and
discovered
that
he
had
never
heard
of
a
person
named
winterfield
having
acknowledged
his
ignorance
in
his
own
eloquent
language
he
drifted
away
to
the
in
the
next
room
and
gravely
contemplated
eyrecourt
with
her
nose
buried
in
flowers
the
doctor
turned
to
me
am
i
wrong
father
benwell
in
supposing
that
i
had
better
have
addressed
myself
to
i
admitted
that
i
knew
a
gentleman
named
winterfield
wybrow
got
up
directly
have
you
a
few
minutes
to
spare
he
asked
it
is
needless
to
say
that
i
was
at
the
doctor
s
disposal
my
house
is
close
by
and
my
carriage
is
at
the
door
he
resumed
when
you
feel
inclined
to
say
to
our
friend
eyrecourt
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
which
i
think
you
ought
to
we
took
our
departure
at
once
eyrecourt
leaving
some
of
the
color
of
her
nose
among
the
flowers
patted
me
encouragingly
with
her
fan
and
told
the
doctor
that
he
was
forgiven
on
the
understanding
that
he
would
never
do
it
in
five
minutes
more
we
were
in
wybrow
s
study
my
watch
tells
me
that
i
can
not
hope
to
finish
this
letter
by
post
time
accept
what
i
have
written
thus
far
and
be
assured
that
the
conclusion
of
my
report
shall
follow
a
day
later
ii
the
doctor
began
cautiously
winterfield
is
not
a
very
common
name
he
said
but
it
may
not
be
amiss
father
benwell
to
discover
if
we
can
whether
winterfield
is
the
man
of
whom
i
am
in
search
do
you
only
know
him
by
name
or
are
you
a
friend
of
his
i
answered
of
course
that
i
was
a
friend
wybrow
went
on
will
you
pardon
me
if
i
venture
on
an
indiscreet
question
when
you
are
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
i
am
sure
you
will
understand
and
excuse
me
are
you
aware
of
any
what
shall
i
call
it
any
romantic
incident
in
winterfield
s
past
life
this
time
feeling
myself
in
all
probability
on
the
brink
of
discovery
i
was
careful
to
preserve
my
composure
i
said
quietly
some
such
incident
as
you
describe
has
occurred
in
winterfield
s
past
there
i
stopped
discreetly
and
looked
as
if
i
knew
all
about
it
the
doctor
showed
no
curiosity
to
hear
more
my
object
he
went
on
was
merely
to
be
reasonably
sure
that
i
was
speaking
to
the
right
person
in
speaking
to
you
i
may
now
tell
you
that
i
have
no
personal
interest
in
trying
to
discover
winterfield
i
only
act
as
the
representative
of
an
old
friend
of
mine
he
is
the
proprietor
of
a
private
asylum
at
sandsworth
a
man
whose
integrity
is
beyond
dispute
or
he
would
not
be
my
friend
you
understand
my
motive
in
saying
this
proprietors
of
private
asylums
are
in
these
days
the
objects
of
very
general
distrust
in
england
i
understood
the
doctor
s
motive
perfectly
he
proceeded
yesterday
evening
my
friend
called
upon
me
and
said
that
he
had
a
remarkable
case
in
his
house
which
he
believed
would
interest
me
the
person
to
whom
he
alluded
was
a
french
boy
whose
mental
powers
had
been
imperfectly
developed
from
his
childhood
the
mischief
had
been
aggravated
when
he
was
about
thirteen
years
old
by
a
serious
fright
when
he
was
placed
in
my
asylum
he
was
not
idiotic
and
not
dangerously
mad
it
was
a
case
not
to
use
technical
language
of
deficient
intelligence
tending
sometimes
toward
acts
of
unreasoning
mischief
and
petty
theft
but
never
approaching
to
acts
of
downright
violence
my
friend
was
especially
interested
in
the
lad
won
his
confidence
and
affection
by
acts
of
kindness
and
so
improved
his
bodily
health
as
to
justify
some
hope
of
also
improving
the
state
of
his
mind
when
a
misfortune
occurred
which
has
altered
the
whole
prospect
the
poor
creature
has
fallen
ill
of
a
fever
and
the
fever
has
developed
to
typhus
so
far
there
has
been
little
to
interest
you
i
am
coming
to
a
remarkable
event
at
last
at
the
stage
of
the
fever
when
delirium
usually
occurs
in
patients
of
sound
mind
this
crazy
french
boy
has
become
perfectly
sane
and
reasonable
i
looked
at
him
when
he
made
this
amazing
assertion
with
a
momentary
doubt
of
his
being
in
earnest
doctor
wybrow
understood
me
just
what
i
thought
too
when
i
first
heard
it
he
said
my
friend
was
neither
offended
nor
surprised
after
inviting
me
to
go
to
his
house
and
judge
for
myself
he
referred
me
to
a
similar
case
publicly
cited
in
the
cornhill
magazine
for
the
month
of
april
in
an
article
entitled
bodily
illness
as
a
mental
the
article
is
published
anonymously
but
the
character
of
the
periodical
in
which
it
appears
is
a
sufficient
guarantee
of
the
trustworthiness
of
the
statement
i
was
so
far
influenced
by
the
testimony
thus
cited
that
i
drove
to
sandsworth
and
examined
the
case
did
the
examination
satisfy
you
thoroughly
when
i
saw
him
last
night
the
poor
boy
was
as
sane
as
i
am
there
is
however
a
complication
in
this
instance
which
is
not
mentioned
in
the
case
related
in
print
the
boy
appears
to
have
entirely
forgotten
every
event
in
his
past
life
reckoning
from
the
time
when
the
bodily
illness
brought
with
it
the
strange
mental
recovery
which
i
have
mentioned
to
this
was
a
disappointment
i
had
begun
to
hope
for
some
coming
result
obtained
by
the
lad
s
confession
is
it
quite
correct
to
call
him
sane
when
his
memory
is
gone
i
ventured
to
ask
in
this
case
there
is
no
necessity
to
enter
into
the
question
the
doctor
answered
the
boy
s
lapse
of
memory
refers
as
i
told
you
to
his
past
life
that
is
to
say
his
life
when
his
intellect
was
deranged
during
the
extraordinary
interval
of
sanity
that
has
now
declared
itself
he
is
putting
his
mental
powers
to
their
first
free
use
and
none
of
them
fail
him
so
far
as
i
can
see
his
new
memory
if
i
may
call
it
so
preserves
the
knowledge
of
what
has
happened
since
his
illness
you
may
imagine
how
this
problem
in
brain
disease
interests
me
and
you
will
not
wonder
that
i
am
going
back
to
sandsworth
tomorrow
afternoon
when
i
have
done
with
my
professional
visits
but
you
may
be
reasonably
surprised
at
my
troubling
with
details
which
are
mainly
interesting
to
a
medical
was
he
about
to
ask
me
to
go
with
him
to
the
asylum
i
replied
very
briefly
merely
saying
that
the
details
were
interesting
to
every
student
of
human
nature
if
he
could
have
felt
my
pulse
at
that
moment
i
am
afraid
he
might
have
thought
i
was
in
a
fair
way
of
catching
the
fever
too
prepare
yourself
he
resumed
for
another
surprising
circumstance
winterfield
is
by
some
incomprehensible
accident
associated
with
one
of
the
mischievous
tricks
played
by
the
french
boy
before
he
was
placed
under
my
friend
s
care
there
at
any
rate
is
the
only
explanation
by
which
we
can
account
for
the
discovery
of
an
envelope
with
inclosures
found
sewn
up
in
the
lining
of
the
lad
s
waistcoat
and
directed
to
winterfield
without
any
place
of
i
leave
you
to
imagine
the
effect
which
those
words
produced
on
me
now
said
the
doctor
you
will
understand
why
i
put
such
strange
questions
to
you
my
friend
and
i
are
both
men
we
go
very
little
into
society
as
the
phrase
is
and
neither
he
nor
i
had
ever
heard
the
name
of
winterfield
as
a
certain
proportion
of
my
patients
happen
to
be
people
with
a
large
experience
of
society
i
undertook
to
make
inquiries
so
that
the
packet
might
be
delivered
if
possible
to
the
right
person
you
heard
how
eyrecourt
surely
a
likely
lady
to
assist
me
received
my
unlucky
reference
to
the
madhouse
and
you
saw
how
i
puzzled
sir
john
i
consider
myself
most
fortunate
father
benwell
in
having
had
the
honor
of
meeting
you
will
you
accompany
me
to
the
asylum
and
can
you
add
to
the
favor
by
bringing
winterfield
with
you
this
last
request
it
was
out
of
my
power
really
out
of
my
power
to
grant
winterfield
had
left
london
that
morning
on
his
visit
to
paris
his
address
there
was
thus
far
not
known
to
me
well
you
must
represent
your
friend
the
doctor
said
time
is
every
way
of
importance
in
this
case
will
you
kindly
call
here
at
five
afternoon
i
was
punctual
to
my
appointment
we
drove
together
to
the
asylum
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
trouble
you
with
a
narrative
of
what
i
saw
favored
by
doctor
wybrow
s
introduction
at
the
french
boy
s
bedside
it
was
simply
a
repetition
of
what
i
had
already
heard
there
he
lay
at
the
height
of
the
fever
asking
in
the
intervals
of
relief
intelligent
questions
relating
to
the
medicines
administered
to
him
and
perfectly
understanding
the
answers
he
was
only
irritable
when
we
asked
him
to
take
his
memory
back
to
the
time
before
his
illness
and
then
he
answered
in
french
i
haven
t
got
a
but
i
have
something
else
to
tell
you
which
is
deserving
of
your
best
attention
the
envelope
and
its
inclosures
addressed
to
bernard
winterfield
are
in
my
possession
the
christian
name
sufficiently
identifies
the
inscription
with
the
winterfield
whom
i
know
the
circumstances
under
which
the
discovery
was
made
were
related
to
me
by
the
proprietor
of
the
asylum
when
the
boy
was
brought
to
the
house
two
french
ladies
his
mother
and
sister
accompanied
him
and
mentioned
what
had
been
their
own
domestic
experience
of
the
case
they
described
the
wandering
propensities
which
took
the
lad
away
from
home
and
the
odd
concealment
of
his
waistcoat
on
the
last
occasion
when
he
had
returned
from
one
of
his
vagrant
outbreaks
on
his
first
night
at
the
asylum
he
became
excited
by
finding
himself
in
a
strange
place
it
was
necessary
to
give
him
a
composing
draught
on
going
to
bed
he
was
purposely
not
prevented
from
hiding
his
waistcoat
under
the
pillow
as
usual
when
the
sedative
had
produced
its
effect
the
attendant
easily
possessed
himself
of
the
hidden
garment
it
was
the
plain
duty
of
the
master
of
the
house
to
make
sure
that
nothing
likely
to
be
turned
to
evil
uses
was
concealed
by
a
patient
the
seal
which
had
secured
the
envelope
was
found
on
examination
to
have
been
broken
i
would
not
have
broken
the
seal
myself
our
host
added
but
as
things
were
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
look
at
the
inclosures
they
refer
to
private
affairs
of
winterfield
in
which
he
is
deeply
interested
and
they
ought
to
have
been
long
since
placed
in
his
possession
i
need
hardly
say
that
i
consider
myself
bound
to
preserve
the
strictest
silence
as
to
what
i
have
read
an
envelope
containing
some
blank
sheets
of
paper
was
put
back
in
the
boy
s
waistcoat
so
that
he
might
feel
it
in
its
place
under
the
lining
when
he
woke
the
original
envelope
and
inclosures
with
a
statement
of
circumstances
signed
by
my
assistant
and
myself
have
been
secured
under
another
cover
sealed
with
my
own
seal
i
have
done
my
best
to
discover
bernard
winterfield
he
appears
not
to
live
in
london
at
least
i
failed
to
find
his
name
in
the
directory
i
wrote
next
mentioning
what
had
happened
to
the
english
gentleman
to
whom
i
send
reports
of
the
lad
s
health
he
couldn
t
help
me
a
second
letter
to
the
french
ladies
only
produced
the
same
result
i
own
i
should
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
my
responsibility
on
honorable
all
this
was
said
in
the
boy
s
presence
he
lay
listening
to
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
story
told
of
some
one
else
i
could
not
resist
the
useless
desire
to
question
him
not
speaking
french
myself
although
i
can
read
the
language
i
asked
doctor
wybrow
and
his
friend
to
interpret
for
me
my
questions
led
to
nothing
the
french
boy
knew
no
more
about
the
stolen
envelope
than
i
did
there
was
no
discoverable
motive
mind
for
suspecting
him
of
imposing
on
us
when
i
said
perhaps
you
stole
it
he
answered
quite
composedly
very
likely
they
tell
me
i
have
been
mad
i
don
t
remember
it
myself
but
mad
people
do
strange
i
tried
him
again
or
perhaps
you
took
it
away
out
of
mischief
and
you
broke
the
seal
and
looked
at
the
papers
i
dare
and
then
you
kept
them
hidden
thinking
they
might
be
of
some
use
to
you
or
perhaps
feeling
ashamed
of
what
you
had
done
and
meaning
to
restore
them
if
you
got
the
opportunity
you
know
best
the
same
result
followed
when
we
tried
to
find
out
where
he
had
been
and
what
people
had
taken
care
of
him
during
his
last
vagrant
escape
from
home
it
was
a
new
revelation
to
him
that
he
had
been
anywhere
with
evident
interest
he
applied
to
us
to
tell
him
where
he
had
wandered
to
and
what
people
he
had
seen
so
our
last
attempts
at
enlightenment
ended
we
came
to
the
final
question
of
how
to
place
the
papers
with
the
least
possible
loss
of
time
in
winterfield
s
hands
his
absence
in
paris
having
been
mentioned
i
stated
plainly
my
own
position
toward
him
at
the
present
time
mr
winterfield
has
made
an
appointment
with
me
to
call
at
his
hotel
on
his
return
to
london
i
said
i
shall
probably
be
the
first
friend
who
sees
him
if
you
will
trust
me
with
your
sealed
packet
in
consideration
of
these
circumstances
i
will
give
you
a
formal
receipt
for
it
in
doctor
wybrow
s
presence
and
i
will
add
any
written
pledge
that
you
may
require
on
my
part
acting
as
winterfield
s
representative
and
friend
perhaps
you
would
like
a
reference
as
well
he
made
a
courteous
reply
a
friend
of
wybrow
s
he
said
requires
no
other
excuse
me
i
persisted
i
had
the
honor
of
meeting
doctor
wybrow
for
the
first
time
yesterday
permit
me
to
refer
you
to
lord
loring
who
has
long
known
me
as
his
spiritual
director
and
this
account
of
myself
settled
the
matter
i
drew
out
the
necessary
securities
and
i
have
all
the
papers
lying
before
me
on
my
desk
at
this
moment
you
remember
how
seals
were
broken
and
impressed
again
at
the
roman
in
the
revolutionary
days
when
we
were
both
young
men
thanks
to
the
knowledge
then
obtained
the
extraordinary
events
which
once
associated
winterfield
and
miss
eyrecourt
are
at
last
plainly
revealed
to
me
copies
of
the
papers
are
in
my
possession
and
the
originals
are
sealed
again
with
the
crest
of
the
proprietor
of
the
asylum
as
if
nothing
had
happened
i
make
no
attempt
to
excuse
myself
you
know
our
motto
the
end
justifies
the
means
i
don
t
propose
to
make
any
premature
use
of
the
information
which
i
have
obtained
the
first
and
foremost
necessity
as
i
have
already
reminded
you
is
to
give
penrose
the
undisturbed
opportunity
of
completing
the
conversion
of
romayne
during
this
interval
my
copies
of
the
papers
are
at
the
disposal
of
my
reverend
brethren
at
headquarters
the
stolen
copies
from
emma
winterfield
to
bernard
maidwell
buildings
belhaven
how
shall
i
address
you
dear
bernard
or
sir
it
doesn
t
matter
i
am
going
to
do
one
of
the
few
good
actions
of
my
life
and
familiarities
or
formalities
matter
nothing
to
a
woman
who
lies
on
her
deathbed
yes
i
have
met
with
another
accident
shortly
after
the
date
of
our
separation
you
heard
i
think
of
the
fall
in
the
circus
that
fractured
my
skull
on
that
occasion
a
surgical
operation
and
a
bit
of
silver
plate
in
place
of
the
bone
put
me
right
again
this
time
it
has
been
the
kick
of
a
horse
in
the
stables
some
internal
injury
is
the
consequence
i
may
die
or
live
till
next
week
anyway
the
doctor
has
confessed
it
my
time
has
come
mind
one
thing
the
drink
that
vile
habit
which
lost
me
your
love
and
banished
me
from
your
house
the
drink
is
not
to
blame
for
this
last
misfortune
only
the
day
before
it
happened
i
had
taken
the
pledge
under
persuasion
of
the
good
rector
here
the
reverend
fennick
it
is
he
who
has
brought
me
to
make
this
confession
and
who
takes
it
down
in
writing
at
my
bedside
do
you
remember
how
i
once
hated
the
very
name
of
a
parson
and
when
you
proposed
in
joke
to
marry
me
before
the
registrar
how
i
took
it
in
downright
earnest
and
kept
you
to
your
word
we
poor
and
acrobats
only
knew
clergymen
as
the
worst
enemies
we
had
always
using
their
influence
to
keep
the
people
out
of
our
show
and
the
bread
out
of
our
mouths
if
i
had
met
with
fennick
in
my
younger
days
what
a
different
woman
i
might
have
been
well
regrets
of
that
kind
are
useless
now
i
am
truly
sorry
bernard
for
the
evil
that
i
have
done
to
you
and
i
ask
your
pardon
with
a
contrite
heart
you
will
at
least
allow
it
in
my
favor
that
your
drunken
wife
knew
she
was
unworthy
of
you
i
refused
to
accept
the
allowance
that
you
offered
to
me
i
respected
your
name
for
seven
years
from
the
time
of
our
separation
i
returned
to
my
profession
under
an
assumed
name
and
never
troubled
you
the
one
thing
i
could
not
do
was
to
forget
you
if
you
were
infatuated
by
my
unlucky
beauty
i
loved
devotedly
on
my
side
the
gentleman
who
had
sacrificed
everything
for
my
sake
was
something
more
than
mortal
in
my
estimation
he
was
no
i
won
t
shock
the
good
man
who
writes
this
by
saying
what
he
was
besides
what
do
you
care
for
my
thoughts
of
you
now
if
you
had
only
been
content
to
remain
as
i
left
you
or
if
i
had
not
found
out
that
you
were
in
love
with
miss
eyrecourt
and
were
likely
to
marry
her
in
the
belief
that
death
had
released
you
from
me
i
should
have
lived
and
died
doing
you
no
other
injury
than
the
first
great
injury
of
consenting
to
be
your
wife
but
i
made
the
discovery
it
doesn
t
matter
how
our
circus
was
in
devonshire
at
the
time
my
jealous
rage
maddened
me
and
i
had
a
wicked
admirer
in
a
man
who
was
old
enough
to
be
my
father
i
let
him
suppose
that
the
way
to
my
favor
lay
through
helping
my
revenge
on
the
woman
who
was
about
to
take
my
place
he
found
the
money
to
have
you
watched
at
home
and
abroad
he
put
the
false
announcement
of
my
death
in
the
daily
newspapers
to
complete
your
delusion
he
baffled
the
inquiries
made
through
your
lawyers
to
obtain
positive
proof
of
my
death
and
last
and
in
those
wicked
days
best
service
of
all
he
took
me
to
brussels
and
posted
me
at
the
door
of
the
english
church
so
that
your
lawful
wife
with
her
marriage
certificate
in
her
hand
was
the
first
person
who
met
you
and
the
mock
winterfield
on
your
way
from
the
altar
to
the
wedding
breakfast
i
own
it
to
my
shame
i
triumphed
in
the
mischief
i
had
done
but
i
had
deserved
to
suffer
and
i
did
suffer
when
i
heard
that
miss
eyrecourt
s
mother
and
her
two
friends
took
her
away
from
you
with
her
own
entire
approval
at
the
church
door
and
restored
her
to
society
without
a
stain
on
her
reputation
how
the
brussels
marriage
was
kept
a
secret
i
could
not
find
out
and
when
i
threatened
them
with
exposure
i
got
a
lawyer
s
letter
and
was
advised
in
my
own
interests
to
hold
my
tongue
the
rector
has
since
told
me
that
your
marriage
to
miss
eyrecourt
could
be
lawfully
declared
null
and
void
and
that
the
circumstances
would
excuse
before
any
judge
in
england
i
can
now
well
understand
that
people
with
rank
and
money
to
help
them
can
avoid
exposure
to
which
the
poor
in
their
places
must
submit
one
more
duty
the
last
still
remains
to
be
done
i
declare
solemnly
on
my
deathbed
that
you
acted
in
perfect
good
faith
when
you
married
miss
eyrecourt
you
have
not
only
been
a
man
cruelly
injured
by
me
but
vilely
insulted
and
misjudged
by
the
two
eyrecourts
and
by
the
lord
and
lady
who
encouraged
them
to
set
you
down
as
a
villain
guilty
of
heartless
and
shameless
deceit
it
is
my
conviction
that
these
people
might
have
done
more
than
misinterpret
your
honorable
submission
to
the
circumstances
in
which
you
were
placed
they
might
have
prosecuted
you
for
bigamy
if
they
could
have
got
me
to
appear
against
you
i
am
comforted
when
i
remember
that
i
did
make
some
small
amends
i
kept
out
of
their
way
and
yours
from
that
day
to
this
i
am
told
that
i
owe
it
to
you
to
leave
proof
of
my
death
behind
me
when
the
doctor
writes
my
certificate
he
will
mention
the
mark
by
which
i
may
be
identified
if
this
reaches
you
as
i
hope
and
believe
it
will
between
the
time
of
my
death
and
my
burial
the
rector
who
will
close
and
seal
these
lines
as
soon
as
the
breath
is
out
of
my
body
will
add
what
he
can
to
identify
me
and
the
landlady
of
this
house
is
ready
to
answer
any
questions
that
may
be
put
to
her
this
time
you
may
be
really
assured
that
you
are
free
when
i
am
buried
and
they
show
you
my
nameless
grave
in
the
churchyard
i
know
your
kind
heart
i
die
bernard
in
the
firm
belief
that
you
will
forgive
me
there
was
one
thing
more
that
i
had
to
ask
of
you
relating
to
a
poor
lost
creature
who
is
in
the
room
with
us
at
this
moment
but
oh
i
am
so
weary
fennick
will
tell
you
what
it
is
say
to
yourself
sometimes
perhaps
when
you
have
married
some
lady
who
is
worthy
of
you
there
was
good
as
well
as
bad
in
poor
emma
farewell
two
from
the
rev
charles
fennick
to
bernard
the
rectory
belhaven
sir
it
is
my
sad
duty
to
inform
you
that
emma
winterfield
died
this
morning
a
little
before
five
o
clock
i
will
add
no
comment
of
mine
to
the
touching
language
in
which
she
has
addressed
you
god
has
i
most
sincerely
believe
accepted
the
poor
sinner
s
repentance
her
contrite
spirit
is
at
peace
among
the
forgiven
ones
in
the
world
beyond
the
grave
in
consideration
of
her
wish
that
you
should
see
her
in
death
the
coffin
will
be
kept
open
until
the
last
moment
the
medical
man
in
attendance
has
kindly
given
me
a
copy
of
his
certificate
which
i
inclose
you
will
see
that
the
remains
are
identified
by
the
description
of
a
small
silver
plate
on
the
right
parietal
bone
of
the
skull
i
need
hardly
add
that
all
the
information
i
can
give
you
is
willingly
at
your
service
she
mentions
poor
soul
something
which
she
had
to
ask
of
you
i
prefer
the
request
which
in
her
exhausted
state
she
was
unable
to
address
to
you
in
her
own
words
while
the
performances
of
the
circus
were
taking
place
in
the
next
county
to
ours
a
wandering
lad
evidently
of
deficient
intelligence
was
discovered
trying
to
creep
under
the
tent
to
see
what
was
going
on
he
could
give
no
intelligible
account
of
himself
the
late
winterfield
who
was
born
and
brought
up
as
i
understand
in
france
discovered
that
the
boy
was
french
and
felt
interested
in
the
unfortunate
creature
from
former
happy
association
with
kind
friends
of
his
nation
she
took
care
of
him
from
that
time
to
the
day
of
her
death
and
he
appeared
to
be
gratefully
attached
to
her
i
say
appeared
because
an
inveterate
reserve
marks
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
mental
affliction
from
which
he
suffers
even
his
benefactress
never
could
persuade
him
to
take
her
into
his
confidence
in
other
respects
her
influence
so
far
as
i
can
learn
had
been
successfully
exerted
in
restraining
certain
mischievous
propensities
in
him
which
occasionally
showed
themselves
the
effect
of
her
death
has
been
to
intensify
that
reserve
to
which
i
have
already
alluded
he
is
sullen
and
irritable
and
the
good
landlady
at
the
lodgings
does
not
disguise
that
she
shrinks
from
taking
care
of
him
even
for
a
few
days
until
i
hear
from
you
he
will
remain
under
the
charge
of
my
housekeeper
at
the
rectory
you
have
no
doubt
anticipated
the
request
which
the
poor
sufferer
wished
to
address
to
you
but
a
few
hours
before
her
death
she
hoped
that
you
might
be
willing
to
place
this
friendless
and
helpless
creature
under
competent
protection
failing
your
assistance
i
shall
have
no
alternative
however
i
may
regret
it
but
to
send
him
to
the
workhouse
of
this
town
on
his
way
probably
to
the
public
asylum
believe
me
sir
your
faithful
servant
charles
fennick
i
fear
my
letter
and
its
inclosures
may
be
delayed
in
reaching
you
yesterday
evening
i
had
returned
to
my
house
before
it
occurred
to
me
that
winterfield
had
not
mentioned
your
address
my
only
excuse
for
this
forgetfulness
is
that
i
was
very
much
distressed
while
i
was
writing
by
her
bedside
i
at
once
went
back
to
the
lodgings
but
she
had
fallen
asleep
and
i
dared
not
disturb
her
this
morning
when
i
returned
to
the
house
she
was
dead
there
is
an
allusion
to
devonshire
in
her
letter
which
suggests
that
your
residence
may
be
in
that
county
and
i
think
she
once
spoke
of
you
as
a
person
of
rank
and
fortune
having
failed
to
find
your
name
in
a
london
directory
i
am
now
about
to
search
our
free
library
here
for
a
county
history
of
devon
on
the
chance
that
it
may
assist
me
let
me
add
for
your
own
satisfaction
that
no
eyes
but
mine
will
see
these
papers
for
security
s
sake
i
shall
seal
them
at
once
and
write
your
name
on
the
envelope
by
father
how
the
boy
contrived
to
possess
himself
of
the
sealed
packet
we
shall
probably
never
discover
anyhow
we
know
that
he
must
have
escaped
from
the
rectory
with
the
papers
in
his
possession
and
that
he
did
certainly
get
back
to
his
mother
and
sister
in
london
with
such
complete
information
as
i
now
have
at
my
disposal
the
prospect
is
as
clear
again
as
we
can
desire
the
separation
of
romayne
from
his
wife
and
the
alteration
of
his
will
in
favor
of
the
church
seem
to
be
now
merely
questions
of
time
book
the
fourth
chapter
i
the
breach
is
widened
a
fortnight
after
father
benwell
s
discovery
stella
followed
her
husband
one
morning
into
his
study
have
you
heard
from
penrose
she
inquired
yes
he
will
be
here
to
make
a
long
visit
i
hope
so
the
longer
the
she
looked
at
him
with
a
mingled
expression
of
surprise
and
reproach
why
do
you
say
that
she
asked
why
do
you
want
him
so
much
when
you
have
got
me
thus
far
he
had
been
sitting
at
his
desk
resting
his
head
on
his
hand
with
his
downcast
eyes
fixed
on
an
open
book
when
she
put
her
last
question
to
him
he
suddenly
looked
up
through
the
large
window
at
his
side
the
morning
light
fell
on
his
face
the
haggard
look
of
suffering
which
stella
remembered
on
the
day
when
they
met
on
the
deck
of
the
steamboat
was
again
visible
not
softened
and
chastened
now
by
the
touching
resignation
of
the
bygone
time
but
intensified
by
the
dogged
and
despairing
endurance
of
a
man
weary
of
himself
and
his
life
her
heart
ached
for
him
she
said
softly
i
don
t
mean
to
reproach
are
you
jealous
of
penrose
he
asked
with
a
bitter
smile
she
desperately
told
him
the
truth
i
am
afraid
of
penrose
she
answered
he
eyed
her
with
a
strange
expression
of
suspicious
surprise
why
are
you
afraid
of
penrose
it
was
no
time
to
run
the
risk
of
irritating
him
the
torment
of
the
voice
had
returned
in
the
past
night
the
old
gnawing
remorse
of
the
fatal
day
of
the
duel
had
betrayed
itself
in
the
wild
words
that
had
escaped
him
when
he
sank
into
a
broken
slumber
as
the
morning
dawned
feeling
the
truest
pity
for
him
she
was
still
resolute
to
assert
herself
against
the
coming
interference
of
penrose
she
tried
her
ground
by
a
dangerous
means
the
means
of
an
indirect
reply
i
think
you
might
have
told
me
she
said
that
penrose
was
a
catholic
he
looked
down
again
at
his
book
how
did
you
know
penrose
was
a
catholic
priest
i
had
only
to
look
at
the
direction
on
your
letters
to
well
and
what
is
there
to
frighten
you
in
his
being
a
priest
you
told
me
at
the
loring
s
ball
that
you
took
an
interest
in
penrose
because
i
liked
i
didn
t
know
then
lewis
that
he
had
concealed
his
profession
from
us
i
can
t
help
distrusting
a
man
who
does
he
laughed
not
very
kindly
you
might
as
well
say
you
distrust
a
man
who
conceals
that
he
is
an
author
by
writing
an
anonymous
book
what
penrose
did
he
did
under
orders
from
his
superior
and
moreover
he
frankly
owned
to
me
that
he
was
a
priest
if
you
blame
anybody
you
had
better
blame
me
for
respecting
his
she
drew
back
from
him
hurt
by
the
tone
in
which
he
spoke
to
her
i
remember
the
time
lewis
she
said
when
you
would
have
been
more
indulgent
toward
my
errors
even
if
i
am
that
simple
appeal
touched
his
better
nature
i
don
t
mean
to
be
hard
on
you
stella
he
answered
it
is
a
little
irritating
to
hear
you
say
that
you
distrust
the
most
devoted
and
most
affectionate
friend
that
man
ever
had
why
can
t
i
love
my
wife
and
love
my
friend
too
you
don
t
know
when
i
am
trying
to
get
on
with
my
book
how
i
miss
the
help
and
sympathy
of
penrose
the
very
sound
of
his
voice
used
to
encourage
me
come
stella
give
me
a
kiss
and
let
us
as
the
children
say
make
it
up
he
rose
from
his
she
met
him
more
than
half
way
and
pressed
all
her
love
and
perhaps
a
little
of
her
fear
on
his
lips
he
returned
the
kiss
as
warmly
as
it
was
given
and
then
unhappily
for
both
of
them
he
went
back
to
the
subject
my
own
love
he
said
try
to
like
my
friend
for
my
sake
and
be
tolerant
of
other
forms
of
christianity
besides
the
form
which
happens
to
be
her
smiling
lips
closed
she
turned
from
him
with
the
sensitive
selfishness
of
a
woman
s
love
she
looked
on
penrose
as
a
robber
who
had
stolen
the
sympathies
which
should
have
been
wholly
hers
as
she
moved
away
her
quick
observation
noticed
the
open
book
on
the
desk
with
notes
and
lines
in
pencil
on
the
margin
of
the
page
what
had
romayne
been
reading
which
interested
him
in
way
if
he
had
remained
silent
she
would
have
addressed
the
inquiry
to
him
openly
but
he
was
hurt
on
his
side
by
the
sudden
manner
of
her
withdrawal
from
him
he
spoke
and
his
tone
was
colder
than
ever
i
won
t
attempt
to
combat
your
prejudices
he
said
but
one
thing
i
must
seriously
ask
of
you
when
my
friend
penrose
comes
here
don
t
treat
him
as
you
treated
there
was
a
momentary
paleness
in
her
face
which
looked
like
fear
but
it
passed
away
again
she
confronted
him
firmly
with
steady
eyes
why
do
you
refer
again
to
that
she
asked
is
she
hesitated
and
recovered
herself
is
winterfield
another
devoted
friend
of
yours
he
walked
to
the
door
as
if
he
could
hardly
trust
his
temper
if
he
answered
her
stopped
and
thinking
better
of
it
turned
toward
her
again
we
won
t
quarrel
stella
he
rejoined
i
will
only
say
i
am
sorry
you
don
t
appreciate
my
forbearance
your
reception
of
winterfield
has
lost
me
the
friendship
of
a
man
whom
i
sincerely
liked
and
who
might
have
assisted
my
literary
labors
you
were
ill
at
the
time
and
anxious
about
eyrecourt
i
respected
your
devotion
to
your
mother
i
remembered
your
telling
me
when
you
first
went
away
to
nurse
her
that
your
conscience
accused
you
of
having
sometimes
thoughtlessly
neglected
your
mother
in
her
days
of
health
and
good
spirits
and
i
admired
the
motive
of
atonement
which
took
you
to
her
bedside
for
those
reasons
i
shrank
from
saying
a
word
that
might
wound
you
but
because
i
was
silent
it
is
not
the
less
true
that
you
surprised
and
disappointed
me
don
t
do
it
again
whatever
you
may
privately
think
of
catholic
priests
i
once
more
seriously
request
you
not
to
let
penrose
see
he
left
the
room
she
stood
looking
after
him
as
he
closed
the
door
like
a
woman
thunderstruck
never
yet
had
he
looked
at
her
as
he
looked
when
he
spoke
his
last
warning
words
with
a
heavy
sigh
she
roused
herself
the
vague
dread
with
which
his
tone
rather
than
his
words
had
inspired
her
strangely
associated
itself
with
the
momentary
curiosity
which
she
had
felt
on
noticing
the
annotated
book
that
lay
on
his
desk
she
snatched
up
the
volume
and
looked
at
the
open
page
it
contained
the
closing
paragraphs
of
an
eloquent
attack
on
protestantism
from
the
roman
catholic
point
of
view
with
trembling
hands
she
turned
back
to
the
it
presented
this
written
inscription
to
lewis
romayne
from
his
attached
friend
and
servant
arthur
god
help
me
she
said
to
herself
the
priest
has
got
between
us
already
chapter
ii
a
christian
jesuit
on
the
next
day
penrose
arrived
on
his
visit
to
romayne
the
affectionate
meeting
between
the
two
men
tested
stella
s
as
it
had
never
been
tried
yet
she
submitted
to
the
ordeal
with
the
courage
of
a
woman
whose
happiness
depended
on
her
outward
graciousness
of
manner
toward
her
husband
s
friend
her
reception
of
penrose
viewed
as
an
act
of
refined
courtesy
was
beyond
reproach
when
she
found
her
opportunity
of
leaving
the
room
romayne
gratefully
opened
the
door
for
her
thank
you
he
whispered
with
a
look
which
was
intended
to
reward
her
she
only
bowed
to
him
and
took
refuge
in
her
own
room
even
in
trifles
a
woman
s
nature
is
degraded
by
the
falsities
of
language
and
manner
which
the
artificial
condition
of
modern
society
exacts
from
her
when
she
yields
herself
to
more
serious
deceptions
intended
to
protect
her
dearest
domestic
interests
the
mischief
is
increased
in
proportion
deceit
which
is
the
natural
weapon
of
defense
used
by
the
weak
creature
against
the
strong
then
ceases
to
be
confined
within
the
limits
assigned
by
the
sense
of
and
by
the
restraints
of
education
a
woman
in
this
position
will
descend
to
acts
of
meanness
which
would
be
revolting
to
her
if
they
were
related
of
another
person
stella
had
already
begun
the
process
of
by
writing
secretly
to
winterfield
it
was
only
to
warn
him
of
the
danger
of
trusting
father
benwell
but
it
was
a
letter
claiming
him
as
her
accomplice
in
an
act
of
deception
that
morning
she
had
received
penrose
with
the
outward
cordialities
of
welcome
which
are
offered
to
an
old
and
dear
friend
and
now
in
the
safe
solitude
of
her
room
she
had
fallen
to
a
lower
depth
still
she
was
deliberately
considering
the
safest
means
of
acquainting
herself
with
the
confidential
conversation
which
romayne
and
penrose
would
certainly
hold
when
she
left
them
together
he
will
try
to
set
my
husband
against
me
and
i
have
a
right
to
know
what
means
he
uses
in
my
own
with
that
thought
she
reconciled
herself
to
an
action
which
she
would
have
despised
if
she
had
heard
of
it
as
the
action
of
another
woman
it
was
a
beautiful
autumn
day
brightened
by
clear
sunshine
enlivened
by
crisp
air
stella
put
on
her
hat
and
went
out
for
a
stroll
in
the
grounds
while
she
was
within
view
from
the
windows
of
the
servants
offices
she
walked
away
from
the
house
turning
the
corner
of
a
shrubbery
she
entered
a
winding
path
on
the
other
side
which
led
back
to
the
lawn
under
romayne
s
study
window
garden
chairs
were
placed
here
and
there
she
took
one
of
them
and
seated
herself
after
a
last
moment
of
honorable
hesitation
where
she
could
hear
the
men
s
voices
through
the
open
window
above
her
penrose
was
speaking
at
the
time
yes
father
benwell
has
granted
me
a
holiday
he
said
but
i
don
t
come
here
to
be
an
idle
man
you
must
allow
me
to
employ
my
term
of
leave
in
the
pleasantest
of
all
ways
i
mean
to
be
your
secretary
romayne
sighed
ah
if
you
knew
how
i
have
missed
you
stella
waited
in
breathless
expectation
for
what
penrose
would
say
to
this
would
he
speak
of
no
there
was
a
natural
tact
and
delicacy
in
him
which
waited
for
the
husband
to
introduce
the
subject
penrose
only
said
how
is
the
great
work
getting
on
the
answer
was
sternly
spoken
in
one
word
badly
i
am
surprised
to
hear
that
why
were
you
as
innocently
hopeful
as
i
was
did
you
expect
my
experience
of
married
life
to
help
me
in
writing
my
book
penrose
replied
after
a
pause
speaking
a
little
sadly
i
expected
your
married
life
to
encourage
you
in
all
your
highest
aspirations
he
said
stella
turned
pale
with
suppressed
anger
he
had
spoken
with
perfect
sincerity
the
unhappy
woman
believed
that
he
lied
for
the
express
purpose
of
rousing
irritation
against
her
in
her
husband
s
irritable
mind
she
listened
anxiously
for
romayne
s
answer
he
made
no
answer
penrose
changed
the
subject
you
are
not
looking
very
well
he
gently
resumed
i
am
afraid
your
health
has
interfered
with
your
work
have
you
had
any
return
it
was
still
one
of
the
characteristics
of
romayne
s
nervous
irritability
that
he
disliked
to
hear
the
terrible
delusion
of
the
voice
referred
to
in
words
yes
he
interposed
bitterly
i
have
heard
it
again
and
again
my
right
hand
is
as
red
as
ever
penrose
with
the
blood
of
a
another
destruction
of
my
illusions
when
i
married
romayne
i
don
t
like
to
hear
you
speak
of
your
marriage
in
that
oh
very
well
let
us
go
back
to
my
book
perhaps
i
shall
get
on
better
with
it
now
you
are
here
to
help
me
my
ambition
to
make
a
name
in
the
world
has
never
taken
so
strong
a
hold
on
me
i
don
t
know
why
unless
other
disappointments
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
as
at
this
time
when
i
find
i
can
t
give
my
mind
to
my
work
we
will
make
a
last
effort
together
my
friend
if
it
fails
we
will
put
my
manuscripts
into
the
fire
and
i
will
try
some
other
career
politics
are
open
to
me
through
politics
i
might
make
my
mark
in
diplomacy
there
is
something
in
directing
the
destinies
of
nations
wonderfully
attractive
to
me
in
my
present
state
of
feeling
i
hate
the
idea
of
being
indebted
for
my
position
in
the
world
like
the
veriest
fool
living
to
the
accidents
of
birth
and
fortune
are
content
with
the
obscure
life
that
you
lead
did
you
not
envy
that
priest
he
is
no
older
than
i
am
who
was
sent
the
other
day
as
the
pope
s
ambassador
to
portugal
penrose
spoke
out
at
last
without
hesitation
you
are
in
a
thoroughly
unwholesome
state
of
mind
he
said
romayne
laughed
recklessly
when
was
i
ever
in
a
healthy
state
of
mind
he
asked
penrose
passed
the
interruption
over
without
notice
if
i
am
to
do
you
any
good
he
resumed
i
must
know
what
is
really
the
matter
with
you
the
very
last
question
that
i
ought
to
put
and
that
i
wish
to
put
is
the
question
which
you
force
me
to
what
is
it
when
you
speak
of
your
married
life
said
penrose
your
tone
is
the
tone
of
a
disappointed
man
have
you
any
serious
reason
to
complain
of
romayne
stella
rose
to
her
feet
in
her
eagerness
to
hear
what
her
husband
s
answer
would
be
serious
reason
romayne
repeated
how
can
such
an
idea
have
entered
your
head
i
only
complain
of
irritating
trifles
now
and
then
even
the
best
of
women
is
not
perfect
it
s
hard
to
expect
it
from
any
of
the
interpretation
of
this
reply
depended
entirely
on
the
tone
in
which
it
was
spoken
what
was
the
animating
spirit
in
this
case
irony
or
indulgence
stella
was
ignorant
of
the
indirect
methods
of
irritation
by
means
of
which
father
benwell
had
encouraged
romayne
s
doubts
of
his
wife
s
motive
for
the
reception
of
winterfield
her
husband
s
tone
expressing
this
state
of
mind
was
new
to
her
she
sat
down
again
divided
between
hope
and
fear
waiting
to
hear
more
the
next
words
spoken
by
penrose
astounded
her
the
priest
the
jesuit
the
wily
spiritual
intruder
between
man
and
wife
actually
took
the
wife
s
side
romayne
he
proceeded
quietly
i
want
you
to
be
how
am
i
to
be
happy
i
will
try
and
tell
you
i
believe
your
wife
to
be
a
good
woman
i
believe
she
loves
you
there
is
something
in
her
face
that
speaks
for
her
even
to
an
inexperienced
person
like
myself
don
t
be
impatient
with
her
put
away
from
you
that
besetting
temptation
to
speak
in
irony
it
is
so
easy
to
take
that
tone
and
sometimes
so
cruel
i
am
only
a
i
know
domestic
happiness
can
never
be
the
happiness
of
life
but
i
have
observed
my
of
all
degrees
and
this
i
tell
you
is
the
result
the
largest
number
of
happy
men
are
the
husbands
and
fathers
yes
i
admit
that
they
have
terrible
anxieties
but
they
are
fortified
by
unfailing
compensations
and
encouragements
only
the
other
day
i
met
with
a
man
who
had
suffered
the
loss
of
fortune
and
worse
still
the
loss
of
health
he
endured
those
afflictions
so
calmly
that
he
surprised
me
what
is
the
secret
of
your
philosophy
i
asked
he
answered
i
can
bear
anything
while
i
have
my
wife
and
my
think
of
that
and
judge
for
yourself
how
much
happiness
you
may
have
left
yet
ungathered
in
your
married
those
words
touched
stella
s
higher
nature
as
the
dew
touches
the
thirsty
ground
surely
they
were
nobly
spoken
how
would
her
husband
receive
them
i
must
think
with
your
mind
penrose
before
i
can
do
what
you
ask
of
me
is
there
any
method
of
transformation
by
which
i
can
change
natures
with
you
that
was
all
he
said
and
he
said
it
despondingly
penrose
understood
and
felt
for
him
if
there
is
anything
in
my
nature
worthy
to
be
set
as
an
example
to
you
he
replied
you
know
to
what
blessed
influence
i
owe
and
serenity
of
mind
remember
what
i
said
when
i
left
you
in
london
to
go
back
to
my
friendless
life
i
told
you
that
i
found
in
the
faith
i
held
the
one
sufficient
consolation
which
helped
me
to
bear
my
lot
and
if
there
came
a
time
of
sorrow
in
the
future
i
entreated
you
to
remember
what
i
had
said
have
you
remembered
it
look
at
the
book
here
on
my
desk
look
at
the
other
books
within
easy
reach
on
that
table
are
you
satisfied
more
than
satisfied
tell
me
do
you
feel
nearer
to
an
understanding
of
the
faith
to
which
i
have
tried
to
convert
you
there
was
a
pause
say
that
i
do
feel
nearer
romayne
resumed
say
that
some
of
my
objections
are
removed
are
you
really
as
eager
as
ever
to
make
a
catholic
of
me
now
that
i
am
a
married
man
i
am
even
more
eager
penrose
answered
i
have
always
believed
that
your
one
sure
way
to
happiness
lay
through
your
conversion
now
when
i
know
from
what
i
have
seen
and
heard
in
this
room
that
you
are
not
reconciled
as
you
should
be
to
your
new
life
i
am
doubly
confined
in
my
belief
as
god
is
my
witness
i
speak
sincerely
hesitate
no
longer
be
converted
and
be
have
you
not
forgotten
something
penrose
what
have
i
forgotten
a
serious
consideration
perhaps
i
have
a
protestant
i
have
borne
that
in
mind
romayne
throughout
our
and
you
still
say
what
you
have
just
said
with
my
whole
heart
i
say
it
be
converted
and
be
happy
be
happy
and
you
will
be
a
good
husband
i
speak
in
your
wife
s
interest
as
well
as
in
yours
people
who
are
happy
in
each
other
s
society
will
yield
a
little
on
either
side
even
on
questions
of
religious
belief
and
perhaps
there
may
follow
a
more
profitable
result
still
so
far
as
i
have
observed
a
good
husband
s
example
is
gladly
followed
by
his
wife
don
t
think
that
i
am
trying
to
persuade
you
against
your
will
i
am
only
telling
you
in
my
own
justification
from
what
motives
of
love
for
yourself
and
of
true
interest
in
your
welfare
i
speak
you
implied
just
now
that
you
had
still
some
objections
left
if
i
can
remove
them
well
and
good
if
i
fail
if
you
can
not
act
on
purely
conscientious
conviction
i
not
only
advise
i
entreat
you
to
remain
as
you
are
i
shall
be
the
first
to
acknowledge
that
you
have
done
this
moderation
of
tone
would
appeal
irresistibly
as
stella
well
knew
to
her
husband
s
ready
appreciation
of
those
good
qualities
in
others
which
he
did
not
himself
possess
once
more
her
suspicion
wronged
penrose
had
he
his
own
interested
motives
for
pleading
her
cause
at
the
bare
thought
of
it
she
left
her
chair
and
standing
under
the
window
boldly
interrupted
the
conversation
by
calling
to
romayne
lewis
she
cried
why
do
you
stay
indoors
on
this
beautiful
day
i
am
sure
penrose
would
like
a
walk
in
the
penrose
appeared
alone
at
the
window
you
are
quite
right
romayne
he
said
we
will
join
you
in
a
few
minutes
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
and
met
stella
on
the
lawn
romayne
was
not
with
him
is
my
husband
not
coming
with
us
she
asked
he
will
follow
us
penrose
answered
i
believe
he
has
some
letters
to
stella
looked
at
him
suspecting
some
underhand
exercise
of
influence
on
her
husband
if
she
had
been
able
to
estimate
the
noble
qualities
in
the
nature
of
penrose
she
might
have
done
him
the
justice
to
arrive
at
a
truer
conclusion
it
was
he
who
had
asked
leave
when
stella
had
interrupted
them
to
take
the
opportunity
of
speaking
alone
with
romayne
he
had
said
to
his
friend
if
i
am
wrong
in
my
anticipation
of
the
effect
of
your
change
of
religion
on
your
wife
let
me
find
it
out
from
herself
my
one
object
is
to
act
justly
toward
you
and
toward
her
i
should
never
forgive
myself
if
i
made
mischief
between
you
no
matter
how
innocent
of
any
evil
intention
i
might
romayne
had
understood
him
it
was
stella
s
misfortune
ignorantly
to
misinterpret
everything
that
penrose
said
or
did
for
the
reason
that
he
was
a
catholic
priest
she
had
drawn
the
conclusion
that
her
husband
had
deliberately
left
her
alone
with
penrose
to
be
persuaded
or
deluded
into
giving
her
sanction
to
aid
the
influence
of
the
priest
they
shall
find
they
are
mistaken
she
thought
to
herself
have
i
interrupted
an
interesting
conversation
she
inquired
abruptly
when
i
asked
you
to
come
out
were
you
talking
to
my
husband
about
his
historical
work
no
romayne
we
were
not
speaking
at
that
time
of
the
may
i
ask
an
odd
question
penrose
certainly
are
you
a
very
zealous
catholic
pardon
me
i
am
a
priest
surely
my
profession
speaks
for
me
i
hope
you
are
not
trying
to
convert
my
husband
penrose
stopped
and
looked
at
her
attentively
are
you
strongly
opposed
to
your
husband
s
conversion
he
asked
as
strongly
she
answered
as
a
woman
can
by
religious
conviction
romayne
no
by
penrose
started
is
it
indiscreet
he
said
gently
to
inquire
what
your
experience
may
have
been
i
will
tell
you
what
my
experience
has
been
stella
replied
i
am
ignorant
of
theological
subtleties
and
questions
of
doctrine
are
quite
beyond
me
but
this
i
do
know
a
and
zealous
catholic
shortened
my
father
s
life
and
separated
me
from
an
only
sister
whom
i
dearly
loved
i
see
i
shock
you
and
i
daresay
you
think
i
am
exaggerating
i
hear
what
you
say
romayne
with
very
great
pain
i
don
t
presume
to
form
any
opinion
thus
my
sad
story
can
be
told
in
a
few
words
stella
proceeded
when
my
elder
sister
was
still
a
young
girl
an
aunt
of
ours
my
mother
s
sister
came
to
stay
with
us
she
had
married
abroad
and
she
was
as
i
have
said
a
zealous
catholic
unknown
to
the
rest
of
us
she
held
conversations
on
religion
with
my
sister
worked
on
the
enthusiasm
which
was
part
of
the
girl
s
nature
and
accomplished
her
conversion
other
influences
of
which
i
know
nothing
were
afterward
brought
to
bear
on
my
sister
she
declared
her
intention
of
entering
a
convent
as
she
was
under
age
my
father
had
only
to
interpose
his
authority
to
prevent
this
she
was
his
favorite
child
he
had
no
heart
to
restrain
her
by
force
he
could
only
try
all
that
the
kindest
and
best
of
fathers
could
do
to
persuade
her
to
remain
at
home
even
after
the
years
that
have
passed
i
can
not
trust
myself
to
speak
of
it
composedly
she
persisted
she
was
as
hard
as
stone
my
aunt
when
she
was
entreated
to
interfere
called
her
heartless
obstinacy
a
my
poor
father
s
loving
resistance
was
worn
out
he
slowly
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
death
from
the
day
when
she
left
us
let
me
do
her
justice
if
i
can
she
has
not
only
never
regretted
entering
the
convent
she
is
so
happily
absorbed
in
her
religious
duties
that
she
has
not
the
slightest
wish
to
see
her
mother
or
me
my
mother
s
patience
was
soon
worn
out
the
last
time
i
went
to
the
convent
i
went
by
myself
i
shall
never
go
there
again
she
could
not
conceal
her
sense
of
relief
when
i
took
my
leave
of
her
i
need
say
no
more
arguments
are
thrown
away
on
me
penrose
after
what
i
have
seen
and
felt
i
have
no
right
to
expect
that
the
consideration
of
my
happiness
will
influence
you
but
i
may
perhaps
ask
you
as
a
gentleman
to
tell
me
the
truth
do
you
come
here
with
the
purpose
of
converting
my
husband
penrose
owned
the
truth
without
an
instant
s
hesitation
i
can
not
take
your
view
of
your
sister
s
pious
devotion
of
herself
to
a
religious
life
he
said
but
i
can
and
will
answer
you
truly
from
the
time
when
i
first
knew
him
my
dearest
object
has
been
to
convert
your
husband
to
the
catholic
stella
drew
back
from
him
as
if
he
had
stung
her
and
clasped
her
hands
in
silent
despair
but
i
am
bound
as
a
christian
he
went
on
to
do
to
others
as
i
would
they
should
do
to
she
turned
on
him
suddenly
her
beautiful
face
radiant
with
hope
her
hand
trembling
as
it
caught
him
by
the
arm
speak
plainly
she
cried
he
obeyed
her
to
the
letter
the
happiness
of
my
friend
s
wife
romayne
is
sacred
to
me
for
his
sake
be
the
good
angel
of
your
husband
s
life
i
abandon
the
purpose
of
converting
he
lifted
her
hand
from
his
arm
and
raised
it
respectfully
to
his
lips
then
when
he
had
bound
himself
by
a
promise
that
was
sacred
to
him
the
terrible
influence
of
the
priesthood
shook
even
that
brave
and
lofty
soul
he
said
to
himself
as
he
left
her
god
forgive
me
if
i
have
done
wrong
chapter
iii
winterfield
returns
twice
father
benwell
called
at
derwent
s
hotel
and
twice
he
was
informed
that
no
news
had
been
received
there
of
winterfield
at
the
third
attempt
his
constancy
was
rewarded
winterfield
had
written
and
was
expected
to
arrive
at
the
hotel
by
five
o
clock
it
was
then
four
father
benwell
decided
to
await
the
return
of
his
friend
he
was
as
anxious
to
deliver
the
papers
which
the
proprietor
of
the
asylum
had
confided
to
him
as
if
he
had
never
broken
a
seal
or
used
a
counterfeit
to
hide
the
betrayal
of
a
trust
the
packet
was
safe
in
the
pocket
of
his
long
black
frockcoat
his
own
future
proceedings
depended
in
some
degree
on
the
course
which
winterfield
might
take
when
he
had
read
the
confession
of
the
unhappy
woman
who
had
once
been
his
wife
would
he
show
the
letter
to
stella
at
a
private
interview
as
an
unanswerable
proof
that
she
had
cruelly
wronged
him
and
would
it
in
this
case
be
desirable
if
the
thing
could
be
done
so
to
handle
circumstances
as
that
romayne
might
be
present
unseen
and
might
discover
the
truth
for
himself
in
the
other
event
that
is
to
say
if
winterfield
abstained
from
communicating
the
confession
to
stella
the
responsibility
of
making
the
necessary
disclosure
must
remain
with
the
priest
father
benwell
walked
softly
up
and
down
the
room
looking
about
him
with
eye
a
side
table
in
a
corner
was
covered
with
letters
waiting
winterfield
s
return
always
ready
for
information
of
any
sort
he
even
looked
at
the
addresses
on
the
letters
the
handwritings
presented
the
customary
variety
of
character
all
but
three
of
the
envelopes
showed
the
london
district
postmarks
two
of
the
other
letters
addressed
to
winterfield
at
his
club
bore
foreign
postmarks
and
one
as
the
altered
direction
showed
had
been
forward
from
beaupark
house
to
the
hotel
this
last
letter
especially
attracted
the
priest
s
attention
the
address
was
apparently
in
a
woman
s
handwriting
and
it
was
worthy
of
remark
that
she
appeared
to
be
the
only
person
among
winterfield
s
correspondents
who
was
not
acquainted
with
the
address
of
his
hotel
or
of
his
club
who
could
the
person
be
the
subtly
inquiring
intellect
of
father
benwell
amused
itself
by
speculating
even
on
such
a
trifling
problem
as
this
he
little
thought
that
he
had
a
personal
interest
in
the
letter
the
envelope
contained
stella
s
warning
to
winterfield
to
distrust
no
less
a
person
than
father
benwell
himself
it
was
nearly
five
before
quick
footsteps
were
audible
outside
winterfield
entered
the
room
this
is
friendly
indeed
he
said
i
expected
to
return
to
the
worst
of
all
solitudes
solitude
in
a
hotel
you
will
stay
and
dine
with
me
that
s
right
you
must
have
thought
i
was
going
to
settle
in
paris
do
you
know
what
has
kept
me
so
long
the
most
delightful
theater
in
the
world
the
opera
comique
i
am
so
fond
of
the
bygone
school
of
music
father
benwell
the
flowing
graceful
delicious
melodies
of
the
composers
who
followed
mozart
one
can
only
enjoy
that
music
in
paris
would
you
believe
that
i
waited
a
week
to
hear
nicolo
s
delightful
joconde
for
the
second
time
i
was
almost
the
only
young
man
in
the
stalls
all
round
me
were
the
old
men
who
remembered
the
first
performances
of
the
opera
beating
time
with
their
wrinkled
hands
to
the
tunes
which
were
associated
with
the
happiest
days
of
their
lives
what
s
that
i
hear
my
dog
i
was
obliged
to
leave
him
here
and
he
knows
i
have
come
back
he
flew
to
the
door
and
called
down
the
stairs
to
have
the
dog
set
free
the
spaniel
rushed
into
the
room
and
leaped
into
his
master
s
outstretched
arms
winterfield
returned
his
caresses
and
kisses
him
as
tenderly
as
a
woman
might
have
kissed
her
pet
dear
old
fellow
it
s
a
shame
to
have
left
you
i
won
t
do
it
again
father
benwell
have
you
many
friends
who
would
be
as
glad
to
see
you
as
friend
i
haven
t
one
and
there
are
fools
who
talk
of
a
dog
as
an
inferior
being
to
ourselves
creature
s
faithful
love
is
mine
do
what
i
may
i
might
be
disgraced
in
the
estimation
of
every
human
creature
i
know
and
he
would
be
as
true
to
me
as
ever
and
look
at
his
physical
qualities
what
an
ugly
thing
for
instance
i
won
t
say
your
ear
i
will
say
my
ear
is
crumpled
and
wrinkled
and
naked
look
at
the
beautiful
silky
covering
of
ear
what
are
our
senses
of
smelling
and
hearing
compared
to
his
we
are
proud
of
our
reason
could
we
find
our
way
back
if
they
shut
us
up
in
a
basket
and
took
us
to
a
strange
place
away
from
home
if
we
both
want
to
run
downstairs
in
a
hurry
which
of
us
is
securest
against
breaking
his
neck
i
on
my
poor
two
legs
or
he
on
his
four
who
is
the
happy
mortal
who
goes
to
bed
without
unbuttoning
and
gets
up
again
without
buttoning
here
he
is
on
my
lap
knowing
i
am
talking
about
him
and
too
fond
of
me
to
say
to
himself
what
a
fool
my
master
is
father
benwell
listened
to
this
rhapsody
so
characteristic
of
the
childish
simplicity
of
the
man
with
an
inward
sense
of
impatience
which
never
once
showed
itself
on
the
smiling
surface
of
his
face
he
had
decided
not
to
mention
the
papers
in
his
pocket
until
some
circumstance
occurred
which
might
appear
to
remind
him
naturally
that
he
had
such
things
about
him
if
he
showed
any
anxiety
to
produce
the
envelope
he
might
expose
himself
to
the
suspicion
of
having
some
knowledge
of
the
contents
when
would
winterfield
notice
the
side
table
and
open
his
letters
the
of
the
clock
on
the
steadily
registered
the
progress
of
time
and
winterfield
s
fantastic
attentions
were
still
lavished
on
his
dog
even
father
benwell
s
patience
was
sorely
tried
when
the
good
country
gentleman
proceeded
to
mention
not
only
the
spaniel
s
name
but
the
occasion
which
had
suggested
it
we
call
him
traveler
and
i
will
tell
you
why
when
he
was
only
a
puppy
he
strayed
into
the
garden
at
beaupark
so
weary
and
footsore
that
we
concluded
he
had
come
to
us
from
a
great
distance
we
advertised
him
but
he
was
never
claimed
and
here
he
is
if
you
don
t
object
we
will
give
traveler
a
treat
he
shall
have
dinner
with
perfectly
understanding
those
last
words
the
dog
jumped
off
his
master
s
lap
and
actually
forwarded
the
views
of
father
benwell
in
less
than
a
minute
more
scampering
round
and
round
the
room
as
an
appropriate
expression
of
happiness
he
came
into
collision
with
the
side
table
and
directed
winterfield
s
attention
to
the
letters
by
scattering
them
on
the
floor
father
benwell
rose
politely
to
assist
in
picking
up
the
prostrate
correspondence
but
traveler
was
beforehand
with
him
warning
the
priest
with
a
low
growl
not
to
interfere
with
another
person
s
business
the
dog
picked
up
the
letters
in
his
mouth
and
carried
them
by
installments
to
his
master
s
feet
even
then
the
exasperating
winterfield
went
no
further
than
patting
traveler
father
benwell
s
endurance
reached
its
limits
pray
don
t
stand
on
ceremony
with
me
he
said
i
will
look
at
the
newspaper
while
you
read
your
winterfield
carelessly
gathered
the
letters
together
tossed
them
on
the
dining
table
at
his
side
and
took
the
uppermost
one
of
the
little
heap
fate
was
certainly
against
the
priest
on
that
evening
the
first
letter
that
winterfield
opened
led
him
off
to
another
subject
of
conversation
before
he
had
read
it
to
the
end
father
benwell
s
hand
already
in
his
coat
pocket
appeared
again
empty
here
s
a
proposal
to
me
to
go
into
parliament
said
the
squire
what
do
you
think
of
representative
institutions
father
benwell
to
my
mind
representative
institutions
are
on
their
last
legs
honorable
members
vote
away
more
of
our
money
every
year
they
have
no
alternative
between
suspending
liberty
of
speech
or
sitting
helpless
while
half
a
dozen
impudent
idiots
stop
the
progress
of
legislation
from
motives
of
the
meanest
kind
and
they
are
not
even
sensitive
enough
to
the
national
honor
to
pass
a
social
law
among
themselves
which
makes
it
as
disgraceful
in
a
gentleman
to
buy
a
seat
by
bribery
as
to
cheat
at
cards
i
declare
i
think
the
the
least
degraded
person
of
the
two
doesn
t
encourage
his
inferiors
to
be
false
to
a
public
trust
in
short
my
dear
sir
everything
wears
out
in
this
world
and
why
should
the
house
of
commons
be
an
exception
to
the
rule
he
picked
up
the
next
letter
from
the
heap
as
he
looked
at
the
address
his
face
changed
the
smile
left
his
lips
the
gayety
died
out
of
his
eyes
traveler
entreating
for
more
notice
with
impatient
forepaws
applied
to
his
master
s
knees
saw
the
alteration
and
dropped
into
a
respectfully
recumbent
position
father
benwell
glanced
sidelong
off
the
columns
of
the
newspaper
and
waited
for
events
with
all
the
discretion
and
none
of
the
good
faith
of
the
dog
forwarded
from
beaupark
winterfield
said
to
himself
he
opened
the
letter
read
it
carefully
to
the
end
thought
over
it
and
read
it
again
father
benwell
he
said
suddenly
the
priest
put
down
the
newspaper
for
a
few
moments
more
nothing
was
audible
but
the
steady
of
the
clock
we
have
not
been
very
long
acquainted
winterfield
resumed
but
our
association
has
been
a
pleasant
one
and
i
think
i
owe
to
you
the
duty
of
a
friend
i
don
t
belong
to
your
church
but
i
hope
you
will
believe
me
when
i
say
that
ignorant
prejudice
against
the
catholic
priesthood
is
not
one
of
father
benwell
bowed
in
silence
you
are
mentioned
winterfield
proceeded
in
the
letter
which
i
have
just
are
you
at
liberty
to
tell
me
the
name
of
your
correspondent
father
benwell
asked
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
do
that
but
i
think
it
due
to
you
and
to
myself
to
tell
you
what
the
substance
of
the
letter
is
the
writer
warns
me
to
be
careful
in
my
intercourse
with
you
your
object
i
am
told
is
to
make
yourself
acquainted
with
events
in
my
past
life
and
you
have
some
motive
which
my
correspondent
has
thus
far
failed
to
discover
i
speak
plainly
but
i
beg
you
to
understand
that
i
also
speak
impartially
i
condemn
no
man
unheard
least
of
all
a
man
whom
i
have
had
the
honor
of
receiving
under
my
own
he
spoke
with
a
certain
simple
dignity
with
equal
dignity
father
benwell
answered
it
is
needless
to
say
that
he
now
knew
winterfield
s
correspondent
to
be
romayne
s
wife
let
me
sincerely
thank
you
winterfield
for
a
candor
which
does
honor
to
us
both
he
said
you
will
hardly
expect
me
if
i
may
use
such
an
expression
to
condescend
to
justify
myself
against
an
accusation
which
is
an
anonymous
accusation
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
prefer
to
meet
that
letter
by
a
plain
proof
and
i
leave
you
to
judge
whether
i
am
still
worthy
of
the
friendship
to
which
you
have
so
kindly
with
this
preface
he
briefly
related
the
circumstances
under
which
he
had
become
possessed
of
the
packet
and
then
handed
it
to
winterfield
with
the
seal
uppermost
decide
for
yourself
he
concluded
whether
a
man
bent
on
prying
into
your
private
affairs
with
that
letter
entirely
at
his
mercy
would
have
been
true
to
the
trust
reposed
in
he
rose
and
took
his
hat
ready
to
leave
the
room
if
his
honor
was
profaned
by
the
slightest
expression
of
distrust
winterfield
s
genial
and
unsuspicious
nature
instantly
accepted
the
offered
proof
as
conclusive
before
i
break
the
seal
he
said
let
me
do
you
justice
sit
down
again
father
benwell
and
forgive
me
if
my
sense
of
duty
has
hurried
me
into
hurting
your
feelings
no
man
ought
to
know
better
than
i
do
how
often
people
misjudge
and
wrong
each
they
shook
hands
cordially
no
moral
relief
is
more
eagerly
sought
than
relief
from
the
pressure
of
a
serious
explanation
by
common
consent
they
now
spoke
as
lightly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
father
benwell
set
the
example
you
actually
believe
in
a
priest
he
said
gayly
we
shall
make
a
good
catholic
of
you
don
t
be
too
sure
of
that
winterfield
replied
with
a
touch
of
his
quaint
humor
i
respect
the
men
who
have
given
to
humanity
the
inestimable
blessing
of
quinine
to
say
nothing
of
preserving
learning
and
civilization
but
i
respect
still
more
my
own
liberty
as
a
free
perhaps
a
free
thinker
winterfield
anything
you
like
to
call
it
father
benwell
so
long
as
it
they
both
laughed
father
benwell
went
back
to
his
newspaper
winterfield
broke
the
seal
of
the
envelope
and
took
out
the
inclosures
the
confession
was
the
first
of
the
papers
at
which
he
happened
to
look
at
the
opening
lines
he
turned
pale
he
read
more
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
in
low
broken
tones
he
said
to
the
priest
you
have
innocently
brought
me
most
distressing
news
i
entreat
your
pardon
if
i
ask
to
be
left
father
benwell
said
a
few
words
of
sympathy
and
immediately
withdrew
the
dog
licked
his
master
s
hand
hanging
listlessly
over
the
arm
of
the
chair
later
in
the
evening
a
note
from
winterfield
was
left
by
messenger
at
the
priest
s
lodgings
the
writer
announced
with
renewed
expressions
of
regret
that
he
would
be
again
absent
from
london
on
the
next
day
but
that
he
hoped
to
return
to
the
hotel
and
receive
his
guest
on
the
evening
of
the
day
after
father
benwell
rightly
conjectured
that
winterfield
s
destination
was
the
town
in
which
his
wife
had
died
his
object
in
taking
the
journey
was
not
as
the
priest
supposed
to
address
inquiries
to
the
rector
and
the
landlady
who
had
been
present
at
the
fatal
illness
and
the
death
but
to
justify
his
wife
s
last
expression
of
belief
in
the
mercy
and
compassion
of
the
man
whom
she
had
injured
on
that
nameless
grave
so
sadly
and
so
humbly
referred
to
in
the
confession
he
had
resolved
to
place
a
simple
stone
cross
giving
to
her
memory
the
name
which
she
had
shrunk
from
profaning
in
her
lifetime
when
he
had
written
the
brief
inscription
which
recorded
the
death
of
emma
wife
of
bernard
winterfield
and
when
he
had
knelt
for
a
while
by
the
low
turf
mound
his
errand
had
come
to
its
end
he
thanked
the
good
rector
he
left
gifts
with
the
landlady
and
her
children
by
which
he
was
gratefully
remembered
for
many
a
year
afterward
and
then
with
a
heart
relieved
he
went
back
to
london
other
men
might
have
made
their
sad
little
pilgrimage
alone
winterfield
took
his
dog
with
him
i
must
have
something
to
love
he
said
to
the
rector
at
such
a
time
as
chapter
iv
father
benwell
s
correspondence
the
secretary
when
i
wrote
last
i
hardly
thought
i
should
trouble
you
again
so
soon
the
necessity
has
however
arisen
i
must
ask
for
instructions
from
our
most
reverend
general
on
the
subject
of
arthur
penrose
i
believe
that
i
informed
you
that
i
decided
to
defer
my
next
visit
to
ten
acres
lodge
for
two
or
three
days
in
order
that
winterfield
if
he
intended
to
do
so
might
have
time
to
communicate
with
romayne
after
his
return
from
the
country
naturally
enough
perhaps
considering
the
delicacy
of
the
subject
he
has
not
taken
me
into
his
confidence
i
can
only
guess
that
he
has
maintained
the
same
reserve
with
romayne
my
visit
to
the
lodge
was
duly
paid
this
afternoon
i
asked
first
of
course
for
the
lady
of
the
house
and
hearing
she
was
in
the
grounds
joined
her
there
she
looked
ill
and
anxious
and
she
received
me
with
rigid
politeness
fortunately
eyrecourt
now
convalescent
was
staying
at
ten
acres
and
was
then
taking
the
air
in
her
chair
on
wheels
the
good
lady
s
nimble
and
discursive
tongue
offered
me
an
opportunity
of
referring
in
the
most
innocent
manner
possible
to
winterfield
s
favorable
opinion
of
romayne
s
pictures
i
need
hardly
say
that
i
looked
at
romayne
s
wife
when
i
mentioned
the
name
she
turned
pale
probably
fearing
that
i
had
some
knowledge
of
her
letter
warning
winterfield
not
to
trust
me
if
she
had
already
been
informed
that
he
was
not
to
be
blamed
but
to
be
pitied
in
the
matter
of
the
marriage
at
brussels
she
would
have
turned
red
such
at
least
is
my
experience
drawn
from
recollections
of
other
days
the
ladies
having
served
my
purpose
i
ventured
into
the
house
to
pay
my
respects
to
romayne
he
was
in
the
study
and
his
excellent
friend
and
secretary
was
with
him
after
the
first
greetings
penrose
left
us
his
manner
told
me
plainly
that
there
was
something
wrong
i
asked
no
questions
waiting
on
the
chance
that
romayne
might
enlighten
me
i
hope
you
are
in
better
spirits
now
that
you
have
your
old
companion
with
you
i
said
i
am
very
glad
to
have
penrose
with
me
he
answered
and
then
he
frowned
and
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
two
ladies
in
the
grounds
it
occurred
to
me
that
eyrecourt
might
be
occupying
the
customary
false
position
of
a
i
was
mistaken
he
was
not
thinking
of
his
wife
s
mother
he
was
thinking
of
his
wife
i
suppose
you
know
that
penrose
had
an
idea
of
converting
me
he
said
suddenly
i
was
perfectly
candid
with
him
i
said
i
knew
it
and
approved
of
it
may
i
hope
that
arthur
has
succeeded
in
convincing
you
i
ventured
to
add
he
might
have
succeeded
father
benwell
if
he
had
chosen
to
go
this
reply
as
you
may
easily
imagine
took
me
by
surprise
are
you
really
so
obdurate
that
arthur
despairs
of
your
conversion
i
asked
nothing
of
the
sort
i
have
thought
and
thought
of
it
and
i
can
tell
you
i
was
more
than
ready
to
meet
him
half
then
where
is
the
obstacle
i
exclaimed
he
pointed
through
the
window
to
his
wife
there
is
the
obstacle
he
said
in
a
tone
of
ironical
resignation
knowing
arthur
s
character
as
i
knew
it
i
at
last
understood
what
had
happened
for
a
moment
i
felt
really
angry
under
these
circumstances
the
wise
course
was
to
say
nothing
until
i
could
be
sure
of
speaking
with
exemplary
moderation
it
doesn
t
do
for
a
man
in
my
position
to
show
anger
romayne
went
on
we
talked
of
my
wife
father
benwell
the
last
time
you
were
here
you
only
knew
then
that
her
reception
of
winterfield
had
determined
him
never
to
enter
my
house
again
by
way
of
adding
to
your
information
on
the
subject
of
petticoat
government
i
may
now
tell
you
that
romayne
has
forbidden
penrose
to
proceed
with
the
attempt
to
convert
me
by
common
consent
the
subject
is
never
mentioned
between
the
bitter
irony
of
his
tone
thus
far
suddenly
disappeared
he
spoke
eagerly
and
anxiously
i
hope
you
are
not
angry
with
arthur
he
said
by
this
time
my
little
fit
of
was
at
an
end
i
answered
and
it
was
really
in
a
certain
sense
true
i
know
arthur
too
well
to
be
angry
with
romayne
seemed
to
be
relieved
i
only
troubled
you
with
this
last
domestic
incident
he
resumed
to
bespeak
your
indulgence
for
penrose
i
am
getting
learned
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
church
father
benwell
you
are
the
superior
of
my
dear
little
friend
and
you
exercise
authority
over
him
oh
he
is
the
kindest
and
best
of
men
it
is
not
his
fault
he
submits
to
romayne
against
his
own
better
conviction
in
the
honest
belief
that
he
consults
the
interests
of
our
married
i
don
t
think
i
misinterpret
the
state
of
romayne
s
mind
and
mislead
you
when
i
express
my
belief
that
this
second
indiscreet
interference
of
his
wife
between
his
friend
and
himself
will
produce
the
very
result
which
she
dreads
mark
my
words
written
after
the
closest
observation
of
him
this
new
irritation
of
romayne
s
sensitive
will
hasten
his
conversion
you
will
understand
that
the
one
alternative
before
me
after
what
has
happened
is
to
fill
the
place
from
which
penrose
has
withdrawn
i
abstained
from
breathing
a
word
of
this
to
romayne
it
is
he
if
i
can
manage
it
who
must
invite
me
to
complete
the
work
of
conversion
and
besides
nothing
can
be
done
until
the
visit
of
penrose
has
come
to
an
end
romayne
s
secret
sense
of
irritation
may
be
safely
left
to
develop
itself
with
time
to
help
it
i
changed
the
conversation
to
the
subject
of
his
literary
labors
the
present
state
of
his
mind
is
not
favorable
to
work
of
that
exacting
kind
even
with
the
help
of
penrose
to
encourage
him
he
does
not
get
on
to
his
satisfaction
and
yet
as
i
could
plainly
perceive
the
ambition
to
make
a
name
in
the
world
exercises
a
stronger
influence
over
him
than
ever
all
in
our
favor
my
reverend
friend
all
in
our
favor
i
took
the
liberty
of
asking
to
see
penrose
alone
for
a
moment
and
this
request
granted
romayne
and
i
parted
cordially
i
can
make
most
people
like
me
when
i
choose
to
try
the
master
of
vange
abbey
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
did
i
tell
you
that
the
property
has
a
little
declined
of
late
in
value
it
is
now
not
worth
more
than
six
thousand
a
year
will
improve
it
when
it
returns
to
the
church
my
interview
with
penrose
was
over
in
two
minutes
dispensing
with
formality
i
took
his
arm
and
led
him
into
the
front
garden
i
have
heard
all
about
it
i
said
and
i
must
not
deny
that
you
have
disappointed
me
but
i
know
your
disposition
and
i
make
allowances
you
have
qualities
dear
arthur
which
perhaps
put
you
a
little
out
of
place
among
us
i
shall
be
obliged
to
report
what
you
have
done
but
you
may
trust
me
to
put
it
favorably
shake
hands
my
son
and
while
we
are
still
together
let
us
be
as
good
friends
as
you
may
think
that
i
spoke
in
this
way
with
a
view
to
my
indulgent
language
being
repeated
to
romayne
and
so
improving
the
position
which
i
have
already
gained
in
his
estimation
do
you
know
i
really
believe
i
meant
it
at
the
time
the
poor
fellow
gratefully
kissed
my
hand
when
i
offered
it
to
him
he
was
not
able
to
speak
i
wonder
whether
i
am
weak
about
arthur
say
a
kind
word
for
him
when
his
conduct
comes
under
notice
but
pray
don
t
mention
this
little
frailty
of
mine
and
don
t
suppose
i
have
any
sympathy
with
his
submission
to
romayne
s
prejudices
if
i
ever
felt
the
smallest
consideration
for
and
i
can
not
call
to
mind
any
amiable
emotion
of
that
sort
her
letter
to
winterfield
would
have
effectually
extinguished
it
there
is
something
quite
revolting
to
me
in
a
deceitful
woman
in
closing
this
letter
i
may
quiet
the
minds
of
our
reverend
brethren
if
i
assure
them
that
my
former
objection
to
associating
myself
directly
with
the
conversion
of
romayne
no
longer
exists
yes
even
at
my
age
and
with
my
habits
i
am
now
resigned
to
hearing
and
confuting
the
trivial
arguments
of
a
man
who
is
young
enough
to
be
my
son
i
shall
write
a
letter
to
romayne
on
the
departure
of
penrose
and
i
shall
send
him
a
book
to
read
from
the
influence
of
which
i
expect
gratifying
results
it
is
not
a
controversial
work
arthur
has
been
beforehand
with
me
there
it
is
wiseman
s
recollections
of
the
i
look
to
that
essentially
readable
book
to
excite
romayne
s
imagination
by
vivid
descriptions
of
the
splendors
of
the
church
and
the
vast
influence
and
power
of
the
higher
priesthood
does
this
sudden
enthusiasm
of
mine
surprise
you
and
are
you
altogether
at
a
loss
to
know
what
it
means
it
means
my
friend
that
i
see
our
position
toward
romayne
in
a
new
light
forgive
me
if
i
say
no
more
for
the
present
i
prefer
to
be
silent
until
my
audacity
is
justified
by
events
father
benwell
s
experience
had
in
this
case
not
misled
him
if
stella
had
remained
unmarried
winterfield
might
have
justified
himself
but
he
was
honorably
unwilling
to
disturb
her
relations
with
her
husband
by
satisfying
her
that
he
had
never
been
unworthy
of
the
affection
which
had
once
united
them
chapter
bernard
winterfield
s
correspondence
i
romayne
to
has
my
letter
failed
to
reach
you
i
directed
it
as
i
direct
this
to
beaupark
not
knowing
your
london
address
yesterday
father
benwell
called
at
ten
acres
lodge
he
first
saw
my
mother
and
myself
and
he
contrived
to
mention
your
name
it
was
done
with
his
usual
adroitness
and
i
might
perhaps
have
passed
it
over
if
he
had
not
looked
at
me
i
hope
and
pray
it
may
be
only
my
fancy
but
i
thought
i
saw
in
his
eyes
that
he
was
conscious
of
having
me
in
his
power
and
that
he
might
betray
me
to
my
husband
at
any
moment
i
have
no
sort
of
claim
on
you
and
heaven
knows
i
have
little
reason
to
trust
you
but
i
thought
you
meant
fairly
by
me
when
we
spoke
together
at
this
house
in
that
belief
i
entreat
you
to
tell
me
if
father
benwell
has
intruded
himself
into
your
confidence
or
even
if
you
have
hinted
anything
to
him
which
gives
him
a
hold
over
me
ii
winterfield
to
both
your
letters
have
reached
me
i
have
good
reason
for
believing
that
you
are
entirely
mistaken
in
your
estimate
of
father
benwell
s
character
but
i
know
by
sad
experience
how
you
hold
to
your
opinions
when
they
are
once
formed
and
i
am
eager
to
relieve
you
of
all
anxiety
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
have
not
said
one
word
i
have
not
even
let
slip
the
slightest
hint
which
could
inform
father
benwell
of
that
past
event
in
our
lives
to
which
your
letter
alludes
your
secret
is
a
sacred
secret
to
me
and
it
has
been
and
shall
be
sacredly
kept
there
is
a
sentence
in
your
letter
which
has
given
me
great
pain
you
reiterate
the
cruel
language
of
the
bygone
time
you
say
heaven
knows
i
have
little
reason
to
trust
i
have
reasons
on
my
side
for
not
justifying
myself
except
under
certain
conditions
i
mean
under
conditions
which
might
place
me
in
a
position
to
serve
and
advise
you
as
a
friend
or
brother
in
that
case
i
undertake
to
prove
even
to
you
that
it
was
a
cruel
injustice
ever
to
have
doubted
me
and
that
there
is
no
man
living

you

wybrow
to
dear
sir
i
have
received
your
letter
mentioning
that
you
wish
to
accompany
me
at
my
next
visit
to
the
asylum
to
see
the
french
boy
so
strangely
associated
with
the
papers
delivered
to
you
by
father
benwell
your
proposal
reaches
me
too
late
the
poor
creature
s
troubled
life
has
come
to
an
end
he
never
rallied
from
the
exhausting
effect
of
the
fever
to
the
last
he
was
attended
by
his
mother
i
write
with
true
sympathy
for
that
excellent
lady
but
i
can
not
conceal
from
you
or
from
myself
that
this
death
is
not
to
be
regretted
in
a
case
of
the
same
extraordinary
kind
recorded
in
print
the
patient
recovered
from
the
fever
and
his
insanity
returned
with
his
returning
health
faithfully

chapter

the
saddest
of
all
words
on
the
tenth
morning
dating
from
the
dispatch
of
father
benwell
s
last
letter
to
rome
penrose
was
writing
in
the
study
at
ten
acres
lodge
while
romayne
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
looking
listlessly
at
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
with
the
pen
lying
idle
beside
it
on
a
sudden
he
rose
and
snatching
up
paper
and
pen
threw
them
irritably
into
the
fire
don
t
trouble
yourself
to
write
any
longer
he
said
to
penrose
my
dream
is
over
throw
my
manuscripts
into
the
waste
paper
basket
and
never
speak
to
me
of
literary
work
every
man
devoted
to
literature
has
these
fits
of
despondency
penrose
answered
don
t
think
of
your
work
send
for
your
horse
and
trust
to
fresh
air
and
exercise
to
relieve
your
romayne
barely
listened
he
turned
round
at
the
fireplace
and
studied
the
reflection
of
his
face
in
the
glass
i
look
worse
and
worse
he
said
thoughtfully
to
himself
it
was
true
his
flesh
had
fallen
away
his
face
had
withered
and
whitened
he
stooped
like
an
old
man
the
change
for
the
worse
had
been
steadily
proceeding
from
the
time
when
he
left
vange
abbey
it
s
useless
to
conceal
it
from
me
he
burst
out
turning
toward
penrose
i
believe
i
am
in
some
way
answerable
though
you
all
deny
it
for
the
french
boy
s
death
why
not
his
voice
is
still
in
my
ears
and
the
stain
of
his
brother
s
blood
is
on
me
i
am
under
a
spell
do
you
believe
in
the
witches
the
merciless
old
women
who
made
wax
images
of
the
people
who
injured
them
and
stuck
pins
in
their
mock
likenesses
to
register
the
slow
wasting
away
of
their
victims
day
after
day
people
disbelieve
it
in
these
times
but
it
has
never
been
he
stopped
looked
at
penrose
and
suddenly
changed
his
tone
arthur
what
is
the
matter
with
you
have
you
had
a
bad
night
has
anything
happened
for
the
first
time
in
romayne
s
experience
of
him
penrose
answered
evasively
is
there
nothing
to
make
me
anxious
he
said
when
i
hear
you
talk
as
you
are
talking
now
the
poor
french
boy
died
of
a
fever
must
i
remind
you
again
that
he
owed
the
happiest
days
of
his
life
to
you
and
your
good
wife
romayne
still
looked
at
him
without
attending
to
what
he
said
surely
you
don
t
think
i
am
deceiving
you
penrose
remonstrated
no
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
i
was
wondering
whether
i
really
know
you
as
well
as
i
thought
i
did
am
i
mistaken
in
supposing
that
you
are
not
an
ambitious
man
my
only
ambition
is
to
lead
a
worthy
life
and
to
be
as
useful
to
my
as
i
can
does
that
satisfy
you
romayne
hesitated
it
seems
strange
he
began
what
seems
strange
i
don
t
say
it
seems
strange
that
you
should
be
a
priest
romayne
explained
i
am
only
surprised
that
a
man
of
your
simple
way
of
thinking
should
have
attached
himself
to
the
order
of
the
i
can
quite
understand
that
said
penrose
but
you
should
remember
that
circumstances
often
influence
a
man
in
his
choice
of
a
vocation
it
has
been
so
with
me
i
am
a
member
of
a
roman
catholic
family
a
jesuit
college
was
near
our
place
of
abode
and
a
near
relative
of
mine
since
dead
was
one
of
the
resident
he
paused
and
added
in
a
lower
tone
when
i
was
little
more
than
a
lad
i
suffered
a
disappointment
which
altered
my
character
for
life
i
took
refuge
in
the
college
and
i
have
found
patience
and
peace
of
mind
since
that
time
oh
my
friend
you
might
have
been
a
more
contented
man
he
stopped
again
his
interest
in
the
husband
had
all
but
deceived
him
into
forgetting
his
promise
to
the
wife
romayne
held
out
his
hand
i
hope
i
have
not
thoughtlessly
hurt
you
he
said
penrose
took
the
offered
hand
and
pressed
it
fervently
he
tried
to
speak
and
suddenly
shuddered
like
a
man
in
pain
i
am
not
very
well
this
morning
he
stammered
a
turn
in
the
garden
will
do
me
romayne
s
doubts
were
confirmed
by
the
manner
in
which
penrose
left
him
something
had
unquestionably
happened
which
his
friend
shrank
from
communicating
to
him
he
sat
down
again
at
his
desk
and
tried
to
read
the
time
passed
and
he
was
still
left
alone
when
the
door
was
at
last
opened
it
was
only
stella
who
entered
the
room
have
you
seen
penrose
he
asked
the
estrangement
between
them
had
been
steadily
widening
of
late
romayne
had
expressed
his
resentment
at
his
wife
s
interference
between
penrose
and
himself
by
that
air
of
contemptuous
endurance
which
is
the
hardest
penalty
that
a
man
can
inflict
on
the
woman
who
loves
him
stella
had
submitted
with
a
proud
and
silent
resignation
the
most
unfortunate
form
of
protest
that
she
could
have
adopted
toward
a
man
of
romayne
s
temper
when
she
now
appeared
however
in
her
husband
s
study
there
was
a
change
in
her
expression
which
he
instantly
noticed
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
softened
by
sorrow
before
she
could
answer
his
first
question
he
hurriedly
added
another
is
penrose
really
ill
no
lewis
he
is
about
what
about
you
and
about
is
he
going
to
leave
us
but
he
will
come
back
again
stella
took
a
chair
by
her
husband
s
side
i
am
truly
sorry
for
you
lewis
she
said
it
is
even
a
sad
parting
for
me
if
you
will
let
me
say
it
i
have
a
sincere
regard
for
dear
under
other
circumstances
this
confession
of
feeling
for
the
man
who
had
sacrificed
his
dearest
aspiration
to
the
one
consideration
of
her
happiness
might
have
provoked
a
sharp
reply
but
by
this
time
romayne
had
really
become
alarmed
you
speak
as
if
arthur
was
going
to
leave
england
he
said
he
leaves
england
this
afternoon
she
answered
for
why
does
he
tell
this
to
you
and
not
to
me
romayne
asked
he
can
not
trust
himself
to
speak
of
it
to
you
he
begged
me
to
prepare
you
her
courage
failed
her
she
paused
romayne
beat
his
hand
impatiently
on
the
desk
before
him
speak
out
he
cried
if
rome
is
not
the
end
of
the
journey
what
is
stella
hesitated
no
longer
he
goes
to
rome
she
said
to
receive
his
instructions
and
to
become
personally
acquainted
with
the
missionaries
who
are
associated
with
him
they
will
leave
leghorn
in
the
next
vessel
which
sets
sail
for
a
port
in
central
america
and
the
dangerous
duty
intrusted
to
them
is
to
one
of
the
jesuit
missions
destroyed
by
the
savages
years
since
they
will
find
their
church
a
ruin
and
not
a
vestige
left
of
the
house
once
inhabited
by
the
murdered
priests
it
is
not
concealed
from
them
that
they
may
be
martyred
too
they
are
soldiers
of
the
cross
and
they
go
willingly
go
to
save
the
souls
of
the
indians
at
the
peril
of
their
romayne
rose
and
advanced
to
the
door
there
he
turned
and
spoke
to
stella
where
is
arthur
he
said
stella
gently
detained
him
there
was
one
word
more
he
entreated
me
to
say
pray
wait
and
hear
it
she
pleaded
his
one
grief
is
at
leaving
you
apart
from
that
he
devotes
himself
gladly
to
the
dreadful
service
which
claims
him
he
has
long
looked
forward
to
it
and
has
long
prepared
himself
for
it
those
lewis
are
his
own
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
the
servant
appeared
to
announce
that
the
carriage
was
waiting
penrose
entered
the
room
as
the
man
left
it
have
you
spoken
for
me
he
said
to
stella
she
could
only
answer
him
by
a
gesture
he
turned
to
romayne
with
a
faint
smile
the
saddest
of
all
words
must
be
spoken
he
said
farewell
pale
and
trembling
romayne
took
his
hand
is
this
father
benwell
s
doing
he
asked
no
penrose
answered
firmly
in
father
benwell
s
position
it
might
have
been
his
doing
but
for
his
goodness
to
me
for
the
first
time
since
i
have
known
him
he
has
shrunk
from
a
responsibility
for
my
sake
he
has
left
it
to
rome
and
rome
has
spoken
oh
my
more
than
friend
my
brother
in
love
his
voice
failed
him
with
a
resolution
which
was
nothing
less
than
heroic
in
a
man
of
his
affectionate
nature
he
recovered
his
composure
let
us
make
it
as
little
miserable
as
it
be
he
said
at
every
opportunity
we
will
write
to
each
other
and
who
knows
i
may
yet
come
back
to
you
god
has
preserved
his
servants
in
dangers
as
great
as
any
that
i
shall
encounter
may
that
merciful
god
bless
and
protect
you
oh
romayne
what
happy
days
we
have
had
together
his
last
powers
of
resistance
were
worn
out
tears
of
noble
sorrow
dimmed
the
friendly
eyes
which
had
never
once
looked
unkindly
on
the
brother
of
his
love
he
kissed
romayne
help
me
out
he
said
turning
blindly
toward
the
hall
in
which
the
servant
was
waiting
that
last
act
of
mercy
was
not
left
to
a
servant
with
sisterly
tenderness
stella
took
his
hand
and
led
him
away
i
shall
remember
you
gratefully
as
long
as
i
live
she
said
to
him
when
the
carriage
door
was
closed
he
waved
his
hand
at
the
window
and
she
saw
him
no
more
she
returned
to
the
study
the
relief
of
tears
had
not
come
to
romayne
he
had
dropped
into
a
chair
when
penrose
left
him
in
stony
silence
he
sat
there
his
head
down
his
eyes
dry
and
staring
the
miserable
days
of
their
estrangement
were
forgotten
by
his
wife
in
the
moment
when
she
looked
at
him
she
knelt
by
his
side
and
lifted
his
head
a
little
and
laid
it
on
her
bosom
her
heart
was
full
she
let
the
caress
plead
for
her
silently
he
felt
it
his
cold
fingers
pressed
her
hand
thankfully
but
he
said
nothing
after
a
long
interval
the
first
outward
expression
of
sorrow
that
fell
from
his
lips
showed
that
he
was
still
thinking
of
penrose
every
blessing
falls
away
from
me
he
said
i
have
lost
my
best
years
afterward
stella
remembered
those
words
and
the
tone
in
which
he
had
spoken
them
chapter
vii
the
impulsive
sex
after
a
lapse
of
a
few
days
father
benwell
was
again
a
visitor
at
ten
acres
lodge
by
romayne
s
invitation
the
priest
occupied
the
very
chair
by
the
study
fireside
in
which
penrose
had
been
accustomed
to
sit
it
is
really
kind
of
you
to
come
to
me
said
romayne
so
soon
after
receiving
my
acknowledgment
of
your
letter
i
can
t
tell
you
how
i
was
touched
by
the
manner
in
which
you
wrote
of
penrose
to
my
shame
i
confess
it
i
had
no
idea
that
you
were
so
warmly
attached
to
i
hardly
knew
it
myself
romayne
until
our
dear
arthur
was
taken
away
from
if
you
used
your
influence
father
benwell
is
there
no
hope
that
you
might
yet
persuade
him
to
withdraw
from
the
mission
oh
romayne
don
t
you
know
arthur
s
character
better
than
that
even
his
gentle
temper
has
its
resolute
side
the
zeal
of
the
first
martyrs
to
christianity
is
the
zeal
that
burns
in
that
noble
nature
the
mission
has
been
the
dream
of
his
life
it
is
endeared
to
him
by
the
very
dangers
which
we
dread
persuade
arthur
to
desert
the
dear
and
devoted
colleagues
who
have
opened
their
arms
to
him
i
might
as
soon
persuade
that
statue
in
the
garden
to
desert
its
pedestal
and
join
us
in
this
room
shall
we
change
the
sad
subject
have
you
received
the
book
which
i
sent
you
with
my
letter
romayne
took
up
the
book
from
his
desk
before
he
could
speak
of
it
some
one
called
out
briskly
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
may
i
come
in
and
came
in
without
waiting
to
be
asked
eyrecourt
painted
and
robed
for
the
morning
wafting
perfumes
as
she
moved
appeared
in
the
study
she
looked
at
the
priest
and
lifted
her
hands
with
a
gesture
of
coquettish
terror
oh
dear
me
i
had
no
idea
you
were
here
father
benwell
i
ask
ten
thousand
pardons
dear
and
admirable
romayne
you
don
t
look
as
if
you
were
pleased
to
see
me
good
gracious
i
am
not
interrupting
a
confession
am
i
father
benwell
with
his
paternal
smile
in
perfect
order
resigned
his
chair
to
eyrecourt
the
traces
of
her
illness
still
showed
themselves
in
an
intermittent
trembling
of
her
head
and
her
hands
she
had
entered
the
room
strongly
suspecting
that
the
process
of
conversion
might
be
proceeding
in
the
absence
of
penrose
and
determined
to
interrupt
it
guided
by
his
subtle
intelligence
father
benwell
penetrated
her
motive
as
soon
as
she
opened
the
door
eyrecourt
bowed
graciously
and
took
the
offered
chair
father
benwell
sweetened
his
paternal
smile
and
offered
to
get
a
footstool
how
glad
i
am
he
said
to
see
you
in
your
customary
good
spirits
but
wasn
t
it
just
a
little
malicious
to
talk
of
interrupting
a
confession
as
if
romayne
was
one
of
us
queen
elizabeth
herself
could
hardly
have
said
a
sharper
thing
to
a
poor
catholic
you
clever
creature
said
eyrecourt
how
easily
you
see
through
a
simple
woman
like
me
there
i
give
you
my
hand
to
kiss
and
i
will
never
try
to
deceive
you
again
do
you
know
father
benwell
a
most
extraordinary
wish
has
suddenly
come
to
me
please
don
t
be
offended
i
wish
you
were
a
may
i
ask
why
father
benwell
inquired
with
an
apostolic
suavity
worthy
of
the
best
days
of
rome
eyrecourt
explained
herself
with
the
modest
of
a
maiden
of
fifteen
i
am
really
so
ignorant
i
hardly
know
how
to
put
it
but
learned
persons
have
told
me
that
it
is
the
peculiarity
of
the
jews
may
i
say
the
amiable
peculiarity
never
to
make
converts
it
would
be
so
nice
if
you
would
take
a
leaf
out
of
their
book
when
we
have
the
happiness
of
receiving
you
here
my
lively
imagination
pictures
you
in
a
double
character
father
benwell
everywhere
else
and
say
the
patriarch
abraham
at
ten
acres
father
benwell
lifted
his
persuasive
hands
in
courteous
protest
my
dear
lady
pray
make
your
mind
easy
not
one
word
on
the
subject
of
religion
has
passed
between
romayne
and
myself
i
beg
your
pardon
eyrecourt
interposed
i
am
afraid
i
fail
to
follow
you
my
silent
looks
as
if
he
longed
to
smother
me
and
my
attention
is
naturally
distracted
you
were
about
to
say
i
was
about
to
say
dear
eyrecourt
that
you
are
alarming
yourself
without
any
reason
not
one
word
on
any
controversial
subject
has
passed
eyrecourt
cocked
her
head
with
the
artless
vivacity
of
a
bird
ah
but
it
might
though
she
suggested
slyly
father
benwell
once
more
remonstrated
in
dumb
show
and
romayne
lost
his
temper
mrs
eyrecourt
he
cried
sternly
eyrecourt
screamed
and
lifted
her
hands
to
her
ears
i
am
not
deaf
dear
romayne
and
i
am
not
to
be
put
down
by
any
exhibition
of
what
i
may
call
domestic
ferocity
father
benwell
sets
you
an
example
of
christian
moderation
do
please
follow
romayne
refused
to
follow
it
talk
on
any
other
topic
that
you
like
eyrecourt
i
request
you
don
t
oblige
me
to
use
a
harder
word
i
request
you
to
spare
father
benwell
and
myself
any
further
expression
of
your
opinion
on
controversial
a
may
make
a
request
and
a
may
decline
to
comply
eyrecourt
declined
to
comply
no
romayne
it
won
t
do
i
may
lament
your
unhappy
temper
for
my
daughter
s
sake
but
i
know
what
i
am
about
and
you
can
t
provoke
me
our
reverend
friend
and
i
understand
each
other
he
will
make
allowances
for
a
sensitive
woman
who
has
had
sad
experience
of
conversions
in
her
own
household
my
eldest
daughter
father
benwell
a
poor
foolish
creature
was
converted
into
a
nunnery
the
last
time
i
saw
her
she
used
to
be
sweetly
pretty
my
dear
husband
quite
adored
her
the
last
time
i
saw
her
she
had
a
red
nose
and
what
is
even
more
revolting
at
her
age
a
double
chin
she
received
me
with
her
lips
pursed
up
and
her
eyes
on
the
ground
and
she
was
insolent
enough
to
say
that
she
would
pray
for
me
i
am
not
a
furious
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
and
i
don
t
curse
my
daughter
and
rush
out
into
a
thunderstorm
afterward
but
know
what
king
lear
felt
and
have
struggled
with
hysterics
just
as
he
did
with
your
wonderful
insight
into
human
nature
i
am
sure
you
will
sympathize
with
and
forgive
me
penrose
as
my
daughter
tells
me
behaved
in
the
most
manner
i
make
the
same
appeal
to
your
kind
forbearance
the
bare
prospect
of
our
dear
friend
here
becoming
a
catholic
romayne
s
temper
gave
way
once
more
if
anything
can
make
me
a
catholic
he
said
your
interference
will
do
out
of
sheer
perversity
dear
romayne
not
at
all
eyrecourt
if
i
became
a
catholic
i
might
escape
from
the
society
of
ladies
in
the
refuge
of
a
eyrecourt
hit
him
back
again
with
the
readiest
dexterity
remain
a
protestant
my
dear
and
go
to
your
club
there
is
a
refuge
for
you
from
the
ladies
a
monastery
with
nice
little
dinners
and
all
the
newspapers
and
having
launched
this
shaft
she
got
up
and
recovered
her
easy
courtesy
of
look
and
manner
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
father
benwell
i
have
not
offended
you
i
hope
and
trust
you
have
done
me
a
service
dear
eyrecourt
but
for
your
salutory
caution
i
have
drifted
into
controversial
subjects
i
shall
be
on
my
guard
how
very
good
of
you
we
shall
meet
again
i
hope
under
more
agreeable
circumstances
after
that
polite
allusion
to
a
monastery
i
understand
that
my
visit
to
my
may
as
well
come
to
an
end
please
don
t
forget
five
o
clock
tea
at
my
as
she
approached
the
door
it
was
opened
from
the
outer
side
her
daughter
met
her
why
are
you
here
mamma
stella
asked
why
indeed
my
love
you
had
better
leave
the
room
with
me
our
amiable
romayne
s
present
idea
is
to
relieve
himself
of
our
society
by
retiring
to
a
monastery
don
t
you
see
father
benwell
stella
coldly
returned
the
priest
s
bow
and
looked
at
romayne
she
felt
a
vague
forewarning
of
what
had
happened
eyrecourt
proceeded
to
enlighten
her
as
an
appropriate
expression
of
gratitude
we
are
indeed
indebted
to
father
benwell
my
dear
he
has
been
most
considerate
and
kind
romayne
interrupted
her
without
ceremony
favor
me
he
said
addressing
his
wife
by
inducing
eyrecourt
to
continue
her
narrative
in
some
other
stella
was
hardly
conscious
of
what
her
mother
or
her
husband
had
said
she
felt
that
the
priest
s
eyes
were
on
her
under
any
other
circumstances
father
benwell
s
good
breeding
and
knowledge
of
the
world
would
have
impelled
him
to
take
his
departure
as
things
were
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
more
seriously
romayne
was
annoyed
in
his
presence
the
better
his
own
private
interests
would
be
served
accordingly
he
stood
apart
silently
observant
of
stella
in
spite
of
winterfield
s
reassuring
reply
to
her
letter
stella
instinctively
suspected
and
dreaded
the
jesuit
under
the
spell
of
those
watchful
eyes
she
trembled
inwardly
her
customary
tact
deserted
her
she
made
an
indirect
apology
to
the
man
whom
she
hated
and
feared
whatever
my
mother
may
have
said
to
you
father
benwell
has
been
without
my
romayne
attempted
to
speak
but
father
benwell
was
too
quick
for
him
dear
romayne
nothing
has
been
said
which
needs
any
disclaimer
on
your
i
should
think
not
eyrecourt
added
really
stella
i
don
t
understand
you
why
may
i
not
say
to
father
benwell
what
you
said
to
penrose
you
trusted
penrose
as
your
friend
i
can
tell
you
this
i
am
quite
sure
you
may
trust
father
once
more
romayne
attempted
to
speak
and
once
more
father
benwell
was
beforehand
with
him
may
i
hope
said
the
priest
with
a
finely
ironical
smile
that
romayne
agrees
with
her
excellent
mother
with
all
her
fear
of
him
the
exasperating
influence
of
his
tone
and
his
look
was
more
than
stella
could
endure
before
she
could
restrain
them
the
rash
words
flew
out
of
her
lips
i
am
not
sufficiently
well
acquainted
with
you
father
benwell
to
express
an
with
that
answer
she
took
her
mother
s
arm
and
left
the
room
the
moment
they
were
alone
romayne
turned
to
the
priest
trembling
with
anger
father
benwell
smiling
indulgently
at
the
lady
s
little
outbreak
took
him
by
the
hand
with
intentions
now
don
t
pray
don
t
excite
yourself
romayne
was
not
to
be
pacified
in
that
way
his
anger
was
trebly
intensified
by
the
strain
on
his
nerves
of
the
effort
to
control
himself
i
must
and
will
speak
out
at
last
he
said
father
benwell
the
ladies
of
my
household
have
inexcusably
presumed
on
the
consideration
which
is
due
to
women
no
words
can
say
how
ashamed
i
am
of
what
has
happened
i
can
only
appeal
to
your
admirable
moderation
and
patience
to
accept
my
apologies
and
the
most
sincere
expression
of
my
no
more
romayne
as
a
favor
to
me
i
beg
and
entreat
you
will
say
no
more
sit
down
and
compose
but
romayne
was
impenetrable
to
the
influence
of
friendly
and
forgiving
demonstrations
i
can
never
expect
you
to
enter
my
house
again
he
exclaimed
my
dear
sir
i
will
come
and
see
you
again
with
the
greatest
pleasure
on
any
day
that
you
may
appoint
the
earlier
day
the
better
come
come
let
us
laugh
i
don
t
say
it
disrespectfully
but
poor
dear
eyrecourt
has
been
more
amusing
than
ever
i
expect
to
see
our
excellent
archbishop
and
i
must
really
tell
him
how
the
good
lady
felt
insulted
when
her
catholic
daughter
offered
to
pray
for
her
there
is
hardly
anything
more
humorous
even
in
moliere
and
the
double
chin
and
the
red
nose
all
the
fault
of
those
dreadful
papists
oh
dear
me
you
still
take
it
seriously
how
i
wish
you
had
my
sense
of
humor
when
shall
i
come
again
and
tell
you
how
the
archbishop
likes
the
story
of
the
nun
s
mother
he
held
out
his
hand
with
irresistible
cordiality
romayne
took
it
gratefully
still
bent
however
on
making
atonement
let
me
first
do
myself
the
honor
of
calling
on
you
he
said
i
am
in
no
state
to
open
my
mind
as
i
might
have
wished
to
open
it
to
you
after
what
has
happened
in
a
day
or
two
more
say
the
day
after
father
benwell
hospitably
suggested
do
me
a
great
favor
come
and
eat
your
bit
of
mutton
at
my
lodgings
six
o
clock
if
you
like
and
some
remarkably
good
claret
a
present
from
one
of
the
faithful
you
will
that
s
hearty
and
do
promise
me
to
think
no
more
of
our
little
domestic
comedy
relieve
your
mind
look
at
wiseman
s
recollections
of
the
god
bless
you
the
servant
who
opened
the
house
door
for
father
benwell
was
agreeably
surprised
by
the
papist
s
cheerfulness
he
isn
t
half
a
bad
fellow
the
man
announced
among
his
colleagues
give
me
and
went
out
humming
a
chapter
viii
father
benwell
s
correspondence
the
secretary
i
beg
to
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
your
letter
you
mention
that
our
reverend
fathers
are
discouraged
at
not
having
heard
from
me
for
more
than
six
weeks
since
i
reported
the
little
dinner
given
to
romayne
at
my
lodgings
i
am
sorry
for
this
and
more
than
sorry
to
hear
that
my
venerated
brethren
are
beginning
to
despair
of
romayne
s
conversion
grant
me
a
delay
of
another
week
and
if
the
prospects
of
the
conversion
have
not
sensibly
improved
in
that
time
i
will
confess
myself
defeated
meanwhile
i
bow
to
superior
wisdom
without
venturing
to
add
a
word
in
my
own
defense
ii
the
week
s
grace
granted
to
me
has
elapsed
i
write
with
humility
at
the
same
time
i
have
something
to
say
for
myself
yesterday
lewis
romayne
of
vange
abbey
was
received
into
the
community
of
the
holy
catholic
church
i
inclose
an
accurate
newspaper
report
of
the
ceremonies
which
attended
the
conversion
be
pleased
to
inform
me
by
telegraph
whether
our
reverend
fathers
wish
me
to
go
on
or
not
book
the
fifth
chapter
eyreco
urt
s
discovery
the
leaves
had
fallen
in
the
grounds
at
ten
acres
lodge
and
stormy
winds
told
drearily
that
winter
had
come
an
unchanging
dullness
pervaded
the
house
romayne
was
constantly
absent
in
london
attending
to
his
new
religious
duties
under
the
guidance
of
father
benwell
the
litter
of
books
and
manuscripts
in
the
study
was
seen
no
more
hideously
rigid
order
reigned
in
the
unused
room
some
of
romayne
s
papers
had
been
burned
others
were
imprisoned
in
drawers
and
cupboards
the
history
of
the
origin
of
religions
had
taken
its
melancholy
place
among
the
suspended
literary
enterprises
of
the
time
eyrecourt
after
a
superficially
cordial
reconciliation
with
her
visited
her
daughter
every
now
and
then
as
an
act
of
maternal
sacrifice
she
yawned
perpetually
she
read
innumerable
novels
she
corresponded
with
her
friends
in
the
long
dull
evenings
the
lady
sometimes
openly
regretted
that
she
had
not
been
born
a
man
with
the
three
masculine
resources
of
smoking
drinking
and
swearing
placed
at
her
disposal
it
was
a
dreary
existence
and
happier
influences
seemed
but
little
likely
to
change
it
grateful
as
she
was
to
her
mother
no
persuasion
would
induce
stella
to
leave
ten
acres
and
amuse
herself
in
london
eyrecourt
said
with
melancholy
and
metaphorical
truth
there
is
no
elasticity
left
in
my
on
a
dim
gray
morning
mother
and
daughter
sat
by
the
fireside
with
another
long
day
before
them
where
is
that
contemptible
husband
of
yours
eyrecourt
asked
looking
up
from
her
book
lewis
is
staying
in
town
stella
answered
listlessly
in
company
with
judas
iscariot
stella
was
too
dull
to
immediately
understand
the
allusion
do
you
mean
father
benwell
she
inquired
don
t
mention
his
name
my
dear
i
have
him
on
purpose
to
avoid
it
even
his
name
humiliates
me
how
completely
the
fawning
old
wretch
took
me
in
with
all
my
knowledge
of
the
world
too
he
was
so
nice
and
sympathetic
such
a
comforting
contrast
on
that
occasion
to
you
and
your
husband
i
declare
i
forgot
every
reason
i
had
for
not
trusting
him
ah
we
women
are
poor
creatures
we
may
own
it
among
ourselves
if
a
man
only
has
nice
manners
and
a
pleasant
voice
how
many
of
us
can
resist
him
even
romayne
imposed
upon
me
assisted
by
his
property
which
in
some
degree
excuses
my
folly
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
now
stella
but
to
humor
him
do
as
that
detestable
priest
does
and
trust
to
your
beauty
there
isn
t
as
much
of
it
left
as
i
could
wish
to
turn
the
scale
in
your
favor
have
you
any
idea
when
the
new
convert
will
come
back
i
heard
him
ordering
a
fish
dinner
for
himself
yesterday
because
it
was
friday
did
you
join
him
at
profanely
supported
by
meat
what
did
he
say
what
he
has
said
more
than
once
already
mama
his
peace
of
mind
is
returning
thanks
to
father
benwell
he
was
perfectly
gentle
and
indulgent
but
he
looked
as
if
he
lived
in
a
different
world
from
mine
he
told
me
he
proposed
to
pass
a
week
in
what
he
called
retreat
i
didn
t
ask
him
what
it
meant
whatever
it
is
i
suppose
he
is
there
my
dear
don
t
you
remember
your
sister
began
in
the
same
way
retreated
we
shall
have
romayne
with
a
red
nose
and
a
double
chin
offering
to
pray
for
us
next
do
you
recollect
that
french
maid
of
mine
the
woman
i
sent
away
because
she
would
spit
when
she
was
out
of
temper
like
a
cat
i
begin
to
think
i
treated
the
poor
creature
harshly
when
i
hear
of
romayne
and
his
retreat
i
almost
feel
inclined
to
spit
myself
there
let
us
go
on
with
your
reading
take
the
first
volume
i
have
done
with
what
is
it
mama
a
very
remarkable
work
stella
in
the
present
state
of
light
literature
in
england
a
novel
that
actually
tells
a
story
it
s
quite
incredible
i
know
try
the
book
it
has
another
extraordinary
merit
it
isn
t
written
by
a
stella
obediently
received
the
first
volume
turned
over
the
leaves
and
wearily
dropped
the
wonderful
novel
on
her
lap
i
can
t
attend
to
it
she
said
my
mind
is
too
full
of
my
own
about
romayne
said
her
mother
no
when
i
think
of
my
husband
now
i
almost
wish
i
had
his
confidence
in
priests
and
retreats
the
conviction
grows
on
me
mama
that
my
worst
troubles
are
still
to
come
when
i
was
younger
i
don
t
remember
being
tormented
by
presentiments
of
any
kind
did
i
ever
talk
of
presentiments
to
you
in
the
bygone
days
if
you
had
done
anything
of
the
sort
my
love
excuse
me
if
i
speak
plainly
i
should
have
said
stella
your
liver
is
out
of
order
and
i
should
have
opened
the
family
i
will
only
say
now
send
for
the
carriage
let
us
go
to
a
morning
concert
dine
at
a
restaurant
and
finish
the
evening
at
the
this
characteristic
proposal
was
entirely
thrown
away
on
stella
she
was
absorbed
in
pursuing
her
own
train
of
thought
i
almost
wish
i
had
told
lewis
she
said
to
herself
absently
told
him
of
what
my
dear
of
what
happened
to
me
with
eyrecourt
s
faded
eyes
opened
wide
in
astonishment
do
you
really
mean
it
she
asked
i
do
are
you
actually
simple
enough
stella
to
think
that
a
man
of
romayne
s
temper
would
have
made
you
his
wife
if
you
had
told
him
of
the
brussels
marriage
why
not
why
not
would
romayne
would
any
man
believe
that
you
really
did
part
from
winterfield
at
the
church
door
considering
that
you
are
a
married
woman
your
innocence
my
sweet
child
is
a
perfect
phenomenon
it
s
well
there
were
wiser
people
than
you
to
keep
your
don
t
speak
too
positively
mama
lewis
may
find
it
out
is
that
one
of
your
presentiments
how
is
he
to
find
it
out
if
you
please
i
am
afraid
through
father
benwell
yes
yes
i
know
you
only
think
him
a
fawning
old
hypocrite
you
don
t
fear
him
as
i
do
nothing
will
persuade
me
that
zeal
for
his
religion
is
the
motive
under
which
that
man
acts
in
devoting
himself
to
romayne
he
has
some
abominable
object
in
view
and
his
eyes
tell
me
that
i
am
concerned
in
eyrecourt
burst
out
laughing
what
is
there
to
laugh
at
stella
asked
i
declare
my
dear
there
is
something
absolutely
provoking
in
your
utter
want
of
knowledge
of
the
world
when
you
are
puzzled
to
account
for
anything
remarkable
in
a
clergyman
s
conduct
i
don
t
care
my
poor
child
to
what
denomination
he
belongs
you
can
t
be
wrong
in
attributing
his
motive
to
money
if
romayne
had
turned
baptist
or
methodist
the
reverend
gentleman
in
charge
of
his
spiritual
welfare
would
not
have
forgotten
as
you
have
forgotten
you
little
goose
that
his
convert
was
a
rich
man
his
mind
would
have
dwelt
on
the
chapel
or
the
mission
or
the
infant
school
in
want
of
funds
and
with
no
more
abominable
object
in
view
than
i
have
at
this
moment
in
poking
the
fire
he
would
have
ended
in
producing
his
modest
subscription
list
and
would
have
betrayed
himself
just
as
our
odious
benwell
will
betray
himself
by
the
two
amiable
little
words
please
contribute
is
there
any
other
presentiment
my
dear
on
which
you
would
like
to
have
your
mother
s
candid
opinion
stella
resignedly
took
up
the
book
again
i
daresay
you
are
right
she
said
let
us
read
our
before
she
had
reached
the
end
of
the
first
page
her
mind
was
far
away
again
from
the
unfortunate
story
she
was
thinking
of
that
other
presentiment
which
had
formed
the
subject
of
her
mother
s
last
satirical
inquiry
the
vague
fear
that
had
shaken
her
when
she
had
accidentally
touched
the
french
boy
on
her
visit
to
camp
s
hill
still
from
time
to
time
troubled
her
memory
even
the
event
of
his
death
had
failed
to
dissipate
the
delusion
which
associated
him
with
some
undefined
evil
influence
that
might
yet
assert
itself
a
superstitious
forewarning
of
this
sort
was
a
weakness
new
to
her
in
her
experience
of
herself
she
was
heartily
ashamed
of
it
and
yet
it
kept
its
hold
once
more
the
book
dropped
on
her
lap
she
laid
it
aside
and
walked
wearily
to
the
window
to
look
at
the
weather
almost
at
the
same
moment
eyrecourt
s
maid
disturbed
her
mistress
over
the
second
volume
of
the
novel
by
entering
the
room
with
a
letter
for
me
stella
asked
looking
round
from
the
window
no
ma
am
for
the
letter
had
been
brought
to
the
house
by
one
of
lady
loring
s
servants
in
delivering
it
he
had
apparently
given
private
instructions
to
the
maid
she
laid
her
finger
significantly
on
her
lips
when
she
gave
the
letter
to
her
mistress
in
these
terms
lady
loring
wrote
if
stella
happens
to
be
with
you
when
you
receive
my
note
don
t
say
anything
which
will
let
her
know
that
i
am
your
correspondent
she
has
always
poor
dear
had
an
inveterate
distrust
of
father
benwell
and
between
ourselves
i
am
not
sure
that
she
is
quite
so
foolish
as
i
once
thought
the
father
has
unexpectedly
left
us
with
a
excuse
which
satisfied
lord
loring
it
fails
to
satisfy
me
not
from
any
wonderful
exercise
of
penetration
on
my
part
but
in
consequence
of
something
i
have
just
heard
in
course
of
conversation
with
a
catholic
friend
father
benwell
my
dear
turns
out
to
be
a
jesuit
and
what
is
more
a
person
of
such
high
authority
in
the
order
that
his
concealment
of
his
rank
while
he
was
with
us
must
have
been
a
matter
of
necessity
he
must
have
had
some
very
serious
motive
for
occupying
a
position
so
entirely
beneath
him
as
his
position
in
our
house
i
have
not
the
shadow
of
a
reason
for
associating
this
startling
discovery
with
dear
stella
s
painful
misgivings
and
yet
there
is
something
in
my
mind
which
makes
me
want
to
hear
what
stella
s
mother
thinks
come
and
have
a
talk
about
it
as
soon
as
you
possibly
eyrecourt
put
the
letter
in
her
pocket
smiling
quietly
to
herself
applying
to
lady
loring
s
letter
the
infallible
system
of
solution
which
she
had
revealed
to
her
daughter
eyrecourt
solved
the
mystery
of
the
priest
s
conduct
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
lord
loring
s
check
in
father
benwell
s
pocket
representing
such
a
liberal
subscription
that
my
lord
was
reluctant
to
mention
it
to
my
lady
there
was
the
reading
of
the
riddle
as
plain
as
the
sun
at
noonday
would
it
be
desirable
to
enlighten
lady
loring
as
she
had
already
enlightened
stella
eyrecourt
decided
in
the
negative
as
roman
catholics
and
as
old
friends
of
romayne
the
lorings
naturally
rejoiced
in
his
conversion
but
as
old
friends
also
of
romayne
s
wife
they
were
bound
not
to
express
their
sentiments
too
openly
feeling
that
any
discussion
of
the
priest
s
motives
would
probably
lead
to
the
delicate
subject
of
the
conversion
eyrecourt
prudently
determined
to
let
the
matter
drop
as
a
consequence
of
this
decision
stella
was
left
without
the
slightest
warning
of
the
catastrophe
which
was
now
close
at
hand
eyrecourt
joined
her
daughter
at
the
window
well
my
dear
is
it
clearing
up
shall
we
take
a
drive
before
luncheon
if
you
like
she
turned
to
her
mother
as
she
answered
the
light
of
the
clearing
sky
at
once
soft
and
penetrating
fell
full
on
her
eyrecourt
looking
at
her
as
usual
suddenly
became
serious
she
studied
her
daughter
s
face
with
an
eager
and
attentive
scrutiny
do
you
see
any
extraordinary
change
in
me
stella
asked
with
a
faint
smile
instead
of
answering
eyrecourt
put
her
arm
round
stella
with
a
loving
gentleness
entirely
at
variance
with
any
ordinary
expression
of
her
character
the
worldly
mother
s
eyes
rested
with
a
lingering
tenderness
on
the
daughter
s
face
stella
she
said
softly
and
stopped
at
a
loss
for
words
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
after
a
while
she
began
again
yes
i
see
a
change
in
you
she
whispered
an
interesting
change
which
tells
me
something
can
you
guess
what
it
is
stella
s
color
rose
brightly
and
faded
again
she
laid
her
head
in
silence
on
her
mother
s
bosom
worldly
frivolous
eyrecourt
s
nature
was
the
nature
of
a
woman
and
the
one
great
trial
and
triumph
of
a
woman
s
life
appealing
to
her
as
a
trial
and
a
triumph
soon
to
come
to
her
own
child
touched
fibers
under
the
hardened
surface
of
her
heart
which
were
still
unprofaned
my
poor
darling
she
said
have
you
told
the
good
news
to
your
husband
why
not
he
doesn
t
care
now
for
anything
that
i
can
tell
nonsense
stella
you
may
win
him
back
to
you
by
a
word
and
do
you
hesitate
to
say
the
word
shall
tell
him
stella
suddenly
drew
herself
away
from
her
mother
s
caressing
arm
if
you
do
she
cried
no
words
can
say
how
inconsiderate
and
how
cruel
i
shall
think
you
promise
on
your
word
of
honor
promise
you
will
leave
it
to
me
will
you
tell
him
yourself
if
i
leave
it
to
you
yes
at
my
own
time
promise
hush
hush
don
t
excite
yourself
my
love
i
promise
give
me
a
kiss
i
declare
i
am
agitated
myself
she
exclaimed
falling
back
into
her
customary
manner
such
a
shock
to
my
vanity
stella
the
prospect
of
becoming
a
grandmother
i
really
must
ring
for
matilda
and
take
a
few
drops
of
red
lavender
be
advised
by
me
my
poor
dear
and
we
will
turn
the
priest
out
of
the
house
yet
when
romayne
comes
back
from
his
ridiculous
retreat
after
his
fasting
and
flagellation
and
heaven
knows
what
besides
bring
him
to
his
senses
then
is
the
time
to
tell
him
will
you
think
of
it
yes
i
will
think
of
and
one
word
more
before
matilda
comes
in
remember
the
vast
importance
of
having
a
male
heir
to
vange
abbey
on
these
occasions
you
may
practice
with
perfect
impunity
on
the
ignorance
of
the
men
tell
him
you
re
sure
it
s
going
to

the
seed

sown
situated
in
a
distant
quarter
of
the
vast
western
suburb
of
london
the
house
called
the
retreat
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
garden
protected
on
all
sides
by
a
high
brick
wall
excepting
the
grand
gilt
cross
on
the
roof
of
the
chapel
nothing
revealed
externally
the
devotional
purpose
to
which
the
roman
catholic
priesthood
assisted
by
the
liberality
of
the
faithful
had
dedicated
the
building
but
the
convert
privileged
to
pass
the
gates
left
protestant
england
outside
and
found
himself
as
it
were
in
a
new
country
inside
the
retreat
the
paternal
care
of
the
church
took
possession
of
him
surrounded
him
with
monastic
simplicity
in
his
neat
little
bedroom
and
dazzled
him
with
devotional
splendor
when
his
religious
duties
called
him
into
the
chapel
the
perfect
taste
so
seldom
found
in
the
modern
arrangement
and
decoration
of
convents
and
churches
in
southern
countries
showed
itself
here
pressed
into
the
service
of
religion
in
every
part
of
the
house
the
severest
discipline
had
no
sordid
and
hideous
side
to
it
in
the
retreat
the
inmates
fasted
on
spotless
tablecloths
and
handled
knives
and
forks
the
humble
servants
of
stomachs
without
a
speck
on
their
decent
brightness
penitents

kissed
the
steps
of
the

oriental
phrase

the
inmates

days

which
were

works
of

and
trod
on
a
carpet
of
studiously
modest

and

the

its
own
artesian

not
a

house
drank

in
his
water
a
faint
perfume
of
incense
was
perceptible
in
the
corridors
the
soothing
and
mysterious
silence
of
the
place
was
intensified
rather
than
disturbed
by
soft
footsteps
and
gentle
opening
and
closing
of
doors
animal
life
was
not
even
represented
by
a
cat
in
the
kitchen
and
yet
pervaded
by
some
inscrutable
influence
the
house
was
not
dull
heretics
with
lively
imaginations
might
have
not
inappropriately
likened
it
to
an
enchanted
castle
in
one
word
the
catholic
system
here
showed
to
perfection
its
masterly
knowledge
of
the
weakness
of
human
nature
and
its
inexhaustible
dexterity
in
adapting
the
means
to
the
end
on
the
morning
when
eyrecourt
and
her
daughter
held
their
memorable
interview
by
the
fireside
at
ten
acres
father
benwell
entered
one
of
the
private
rooms
at
the
retreat
devoted
to
the
use
of
the
priesthood
the
demure
attendant
waiting
humbly
for
instructions
was
sent
to
request
the
presence
of
one
of
the
inmates
of
the
house
named
mortleman
father
benwell
s
customary
serenity
was
a
little
ruffled
on
this
occasion
by
an
appearance
of
anxiety
more
than
once
he
looked
impatiently
toward
the
door
and
he
never
even
noticed
the
last
new
devotional
publications
laid
invitingly
on
the
table
mortleman
made
his
appearance
a
young
man
and
a
promising
convert
the
wild
brightness
of
his
eyes
revealed
that
incipient
form
of
brain
disease
which
begins
in
fanaticism
and
ends
not
infrequently
in
religious
madness
his
manner
of
greeting
the
priest
was
absolutely
servile
he
cringed
before
the
illustrious
jesuit
father
benwell
took
no
notice
of
these
demonstrations
of
humility
be
seated
my
son
he
said
mortleman
looked
as
if
he
would
have
preferred
going
down
on
his
knees
but
he
yielded
and
took
a
chair
i
think
you
have
been
romayne
s
companion
for
a
few
days
in
the
hours
of
recreation
the
priest
began
yes
does
he
appear
to
be
at
all
weary
of
his
residence
in
this
house
oh
far
from
it
he
feels
the
benign
influence
of
the
retreat
we
have
had
some
delightful
hours
have
you
anything
to
report
mortleman
crossed
his
hands
on
his
breast
and
bowed
profoundly
i
have
to
report
of
myself
father
that
i
have
committed
the
sin
of
presumption
i
presumed
that
romayne
was
like
myself
not
have
i
spoken
to
you
on
that
subject
no
then
you
have
committed
no
sin
you
have
only
made
an
excusable
mistake
how
were
you
led
into
error
in
this
way
father
romayne
had
been
speaking
to
me
of
a
book
which
you
had
been
so
good
as
to
send
to
him
he
had
been
especially
interested
by
the
memoir
therein
contained
of
the
illustrious
englishman
cardinal
acton
the
degrees
by
which
his
eminence
rose
to
the
rank
of
a
prince
of
the
church
seemed
as
i
thought
to
have
aroused
in
my
friend
a
new
sense
of
vocation
he
asked
me
if
i
myself
aspired
to
belong
to
the
holy
priesthood
i
answered
that
this
was
indeed
my
aspiration
if
i
might
hope
to
be
found
worthy
he
appeared
to
be
deeply
affected
i
ventured
to
ask
if
he
too
had
the
same
prospect
before
him
he
grieved
me
indescribably
he
sighed
and
said
i
have
no
such
hope
i
am
tell
me
father
i
entreat
you
have
i
done
wrong
father
benwell
considered
for
a
moment
did
romayne
say
anything
more
he
asked
no
did
you
attempt
to
return
to
the
subject
i
thought
it
best
to
be
father
benwell
held
out
his
hand
my
young
friend
you
have
not
only
done
no
wrong
you
have
shown
the
most
commendable
discretion
i
will
detain
you
no
longer
from
your
duties
go
to
romayne
and
say
that
i
wish
to
speak
with
mortleman
dropped
on
one
knee
and
begged
for
a
blessing
father
benwell
lifted
the
traditional
two
fingers
and
gave
the
blessing
the
conditions
of
human
happiness
are
easily
fulfilled
if
we
rightly
understand
them
mortleman
retired
perfectly
happy
left
by
himself
again
father
benwell
paced
the
room
rapidly
from
end
to
end
the
disturbing
influence
visible
in
his
face
had
now
changed
from
anxiety
to
excitement
i
ll
try
it
he
said
to
himself
and
stopped
and
looked
round
him
doubtfully
no
not
here
he
decided
it
may
get
talked
about
too
soon
it
will
be
safer
in
every
way
at
my
he
recovered
his
composure
and
returned
to
his
chair
romayne
opened
the
door
the
double
influence
of
the
conversion
and
of
the
life
in
the
retreat
had
already
changed
him
his
customary
keenness
and
excitability
of
look
had
subsided
and
had
left
nothing
in
their
place
but
an
expression
of
suave
and
meditative
repose
all
his
troubles
were
now
in
the
hands
of
his
priest
there
was
a
passive
regularity
in
his
bodily
movements
and
a
beatific
serenity
in
his
smile
my
dear
friend
said
father
benwell
cordially
shaking
hands
you
were
good
enough
to
be
guided
by
my
advice
in
entering
this
house
be
guided
by
me
again
when
i
say
that
you
have
been
here
long
enough
you
can
return
after
an
interval
if
you
wish
it
but
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
first
and
i
beg
to
offer
the
hospitality
of
my
the
time
had
been
when
romayne
would
have
asked
for
some
explanation
of
this
abrupt
notice
of
removal
now
he
passively
accepted
the
advice
of
his
spiritual
director
father
benwell
made
the
necessary
communication
to
the
authorities
and
romayne
took
leave
of
his
friends
in
the
retreat
the
great
jesuit
and
the
great
landowner
left
the
place
with
becoming
humility
in
a
cab
i
hope
i
have
not
disappointed
you
said
father
benwell
i
am
only
anxious
romayne
answered
to
hear
what
you
have
to

talked
as
persistently
of
the
news
of
the
day
as
if
he
had
nothing
else
in
his
thoughts
to
keep
his
companion
s
mind
in
a
state
of
suspense
was
in
certain
emergencies
to
exert
a
useful
preparatory
influence
over
a
man
of
romayne
s
character
even
when
they
reached
his
lodgings
the
priest
still
hesitated
to
approach
the
object
that
he
had
in
view
he
made
considerate
inquiries
in
the
character
of
a
hospitable
man
they
breakfast
early
at
the
retreat
he
said
what
may
i
offer
you
i
want
nothing
thank
you
romayne
answered
with
an
effort
to
control
his
habitual
impatience
of
needless
delay
pardon
me
we
have
a
long
interview
before
us
i
fear
our
bodily
necessities
romayne
excuse
me
if
i
take
the
friendly
liberty
of
suppressing
the
formal
our
bodily
necessities
are
not
to
be
trifled
with
a
bottle
of
my
famous
claret
and
a
few
biscuits
will
not
hurt
either
of
he
rang
the
bell
and
gave
the
necessary
directions
another
damp
day
he
went
on
cheerfully
i
hope
you
don
t
pay
the
rheumatic
penalties
of
a
winter
residence
in
england
ah
this
glorious
country
would
be
too
perfect
if
it
possessed
the
delicious
climate
of
rome
the
wine
and
biscuits
were
brought
in
father
benwell
filled
the
glasses
and
bowed
cordially
to
his
guest
nothing
of
this
sort
at
the
retreat
he
said
gayly
excellent
water
i
am
told
which
is
a
luxury
in
its
way
especially
in
london
well
my
dear
romayne
i
must
begin
by
making
my
apologies
you
no
doubt
thought
me
a
little
abrupt
in
running
away
with
you
from
your
retirement
at
a
moment
s
notice
i
believed
that
you
had
good
reasons
father
and
that
was
enough
for
thank
you
you
do
me
justice
it
was
in
your
best
interests
that
i
acted
there
are
men
of
phlegmatic
temperament
over
whom
the
wise
monotony
of
discipline
at
the
retreat
exercises
a
wholesome
influence
i
mean
an
influence
which
may
be
prolonged
with
advantage
you
are
not
one
of
those
persons
protracted
seclusion
and
monotony
of
life
are
morally
and
mentally
unprofitable
to
a
man
of
your
ardent
disposition
i
abstained
from
mentioning
these
reasons
at
the
time
out
of
a
feeling
of
regard
for
our
excellent
resident
director
who
believes
unreservedly
in
the
institution
over
which
he
presides
very
good
the
retreat
has
done
all
that
it
could
usefully
do
in
your
case
we
must
think
next
of
how
to
employ
that
mental
activity
which
rightly
developed
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
qualities
that
you
possess
let
me
ask
first
if
you
have
in
some
degree
recovered
your
tranquillity
i
feel
like
a
different
man
father
that
s
right
and
your
nervous
sufferings
i
don
t
ask
what
they
are
i
only
want
to
know
if
you
experience
a
sense
of
relief
a
most
welcome
sense
of
relief
romayne
answered
with
a
revival
of
the
enthusiasm
of
other
days
the
complete
change
in
all
my
thoughts
and
convictions
which
i
owe
to
you
and
to
dear
penrose
father
benwell
interposed
with
the
prompt
sense
of
justice
which
no
man
could
more
becomingly
assume
we
must
not
forget
forget
him
romayne
repeated
not
a
day
passes
without
my
thinking
of
him
it
is
one
of
the
happy
results
of
the
change
in
me
that
my
mind
does
not
dwell
bitterly
on
the
loss
of
him
now
i
think
of
penrose
with
admiration
as
of
one
whose
glorious
life
with
all
its
dangers
i
should
like
to
share
he
spoke
with
a
rising
color
and
brightening
eyes
already
the
absorbent
capacity
of
the
roman
church
had
drawn
to
itself
that
sympathetic
side
of
his
character
which
was
also
one
of
its
strongest
sides
already
his
love
for
penrose
hitherto
inspired
by
the
virtues
of
the
man
had
narrowed
its
range
to
sympathy
with
the
trials
and
privileges
of
the
priest
truly
and
deeply
indeed
had
the
physician
consulted
in
bygone
days
reasoned
on
romayne
s
case
that
occurrence
of
some
new
and
absorbing
influence
in
his
life
of
which
the
doctor
had
spoken
that
working
of
some
complete
change
in
his
habits
of
thought
had
found
its
way
to
him
at
last
after
the
wife
s
simple
devotion
had
failed
through
the
subtler
ministrations
of
the
priest
some
men
having
father
benwell
s
object
in
view
would
have
taken
instant
advantage
of
the
opening
offered
to
them
by
romayne
s
unguarded
enthusiasm
the
illustrious
jesuit
held
fast
by
the
wise
maxim
which
forbade
him
to
do
anything
in
a
hurry
no
he
said
your
life
must
not
be
the
life
of
our
dear
friend
the
service
on
which
the
church
employs
penrose
is
not
the
fit
service
for
you
you
have
other
claims
on
romayne
looked
at
his
spiritual
adviser
with
a
momentary
change
of
expression
a
relapse
into
the
ironical
bitterness
of
the
past
time
have
you
forgotten
that
i
am
and
can
be
only
a
layman
he
asked
what
claims
can
i
have
except
the
common
claim
of
all
faithful
members
of
the
church
on
the
good
offices
of
the
priesthood
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
continued
with
the
abruptness
of
a
man
struck
by
a
new
idea
yes
i
have
perhaps
one
small
aim
of
my
own
the
claim
of
being
allowed
to
do
my
in
what
respect
dear
romayne
surely
you
can
guess
i
am
a
rich
man
i
have
money
lying
idle
which
it
is
my
duty
and
my
privilege
to
devote
to
the
charities
and
necessities
of
the
church
and
while
i
am
speaking
of
this
i
must
own
that
i
am
a
little
surprised
at
your
having
said
nothing
to
me
on
the
subject
you
have
never
yet
pointed
out
to
me
the
manner
in
which
i
might
devote
my
money
to
the
best
and
noblest
uses
was
it
forgetfulness
on
your
part
father
benwell
shook
his
head
no
he
replied
i
can
t
honestly
say
then
you
had
a
reason
for
your
silence
may
i
not
know
it
father
benwell
got
up
and
walked
to
the
fireplace
now
there
are
various
methods
of
getting
up
and
walking
to
a
fireplace
and
they
find
their
way
to
outward
expression
through
the
customary
means
of
look
and
manner
we
may
feel
cold
and
may
only
want
to
warm
ourselves
or
we
may
feel
restless
and
may
need
an
excuse
for
changing
our
position
or
we
may
feel
modestly
confused
and
may
be
anxious
to
hide
it
father
benwell
from
head
to
foot
expressed
modest
confusion
and
polite
anxiety
to
hide
it
my
good
friend
he
said
i
am
afraid
of
hurting
your
romayne
was
a
sincere
convert
but
there
were
instincts
still
left
in
him
which
resented
this
expression
of
regard
even
when
it
proceeded
from
a
man
whom
he
respected
and
admired
you
will
hurt
my
feelings
he
answered
a
little
sharply
if
you
are
not
plain
with
then
i
be
plain
with
you
father
benwell
rejoined
the
church
speaking
through
me
as
her
unworthy
interpreter
feels
a
certain
delicacy
in
approaching
you
on
the
subject
of
why
father
benwell
left
the
fireplace
without
immediately
answering
he
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
of
it
a
flat
mahogany
box
his
gracious
familiarity
became
transformed
by
some
mysterious
process
of
congelation
into
a
dignified
formality
of
manner
the
priest
took
the
place
of
the
man
the
church
romayne
hesitates
to
receive
as
benevolent
contributions
money
derived
from
property
of
its
own
arbitrarily
taken
from
it
and
placed
in
a
layman
s
hands
no
he
cried
interrupting
romayne
who
instantly
understood
the
allusion
to
vange
abbey
no
i
must
beg
you
to
hear
me
out
i
state
the
case
plainly
at
your
own
request
at
the
same
time
i
am
bound
to
admit
that
the
lapse
of
centuries
has
in
the
eye
of
the
law
sanctioned
the
deliberate
act
of
robbery
perpetrated
by
henry
the
eighth
you
have
lawfully
inherited
vange
abbey
from
your
ancestors
the
church
is
not
unreasonable
enough
to
assert
a
merely
moral
right
against
the
law
of
the
country
it
may
feel
the
act
of
spoliation
but
it
he
unlocked
the
flat
mahogany
box
and
gently
dropped
his
dignity
the
man
took
the
place
of
the
priest
as
the
master
of
vange
he
said
you
may
be
interested
in
looking
at
a
little
historical
curiosity
which
we
have
preserved
the
dear
romayne
by
which
the
monks
held
your
present
property
in
time
take
another
glass
of
romayne
looked
at
the
and
laid
them
aside
unread
father
benwell
had
roused
his
pride
his
sense
of
justice
his
wild
and
lavish
instincts
of
generosity
he
who
had
always
despised
money
except
when
it
assumed
its
only
estimable
character
as
a
means
for
the
attainment
of
merciful
and
noble
ends
was
in
possession
of
property
to
which
he
had
no
moral
right
without
even
the
poor
excuse
of
associations
which
attached
him
to
the
place
i
hope
i
have
not
offended
you
said
father
benwell
you
have
made
me
ashamed
of
myself
romayne
answered
warmly
on
the
day
when
i
became
a
catholic
i
ought
to
have
remembered
vange
better
late
than
never
i
refuse
to
take
shelter
under
the
law
i
respect
the
moral
right
of
the
church
i
will
at
once
restore
the
property
which
i
have
father
benwell
took
both
romayne
s
hands
in
his
and
pressed
them
fervently
i
am
proud
of
you
he
said
we
shall
all
be
proud
of
you
when
i
write
word
to
rome
of
what
has
passed
between
us
but
no
romayne
this
must
not
be
i
admire
you
feel
with
you
and
i
refuse
on
behalf
of
the
church
i
say
it
i
refuse
the
wait
a
little
father
benwell
you
don
t
know
the
state
of
my
affairs
i
don
t
deserve
the
admiration
which
you
feel
for
me
the
loss
of
the
vange
property
will
be
no
pecuniary
loss
in
my
case
i
have
inherited
a
fortune
from
my
aunt
my
income
from
that
source
is
far
larger
than
my
income
from
the
yorkshire
romayne
it
must
not
be
pardon
me
it
must
be
i
have
more
money
than
i
can
spend
without
vange
and
i
have
painful
associations
with
the
house
which
disincline
me
ever
to
enter
it
even
this
confession
failed
to
move
father
benwell
he
obstinately
crossed
his
arms
obstinately
tapped
his
foot
on
the
floor
no
he
said
plead
as
generously
as
you
may
my
answer
is
romayne
only
became
more
resolute
on
his
side
the
property
is
absolutely
my
own
he
persisted
i
am
without
a
near
relation
in
the
world
i
have
no
children
my
wife
is
already
provided
for
at
my
death
out
of
the
fortune
left
me
by
my
aunt
it
is
downright
obstinacy
forgive
me
for
saying
so
to
persist
in
your
it
is
downright
duty
romayne
if
i
gave
way
to
you
i
should
be
the
means
of
exposing
the
priesthood
to
the
vilest
misinterpretation
i
should
be
deservedly
reprimanded
and
your
proposal
of
restitution
if
you
expressed
it
in
writing
would
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
be
torn
up
if
you
have
any
regard
for
me
drop
the
romayne
refused
to
yield
even
to
this
unanswerable
appeal
very
well
he
said
there
is
one
document
you
can
t
tear
up
you
can
t
interfere
with
my
making
another
will
i
shall
leave
the
vange
property
to
the
church
and
i
shall
appoint
you
one
of
the
trustees
you
can
t
object
to
father
benwell
smiled
sadly
the
law
spares
me
the
ungracious
necessity
of
objecting
in
this
case
he
answered
my
friend
you
forget
the
statutes
of
mortmain
they
positively
forbid
you
to
carry
out
the
intention
which
you
have
just
romayne
dismissed
this
appeal
to
the
law
irritably
by
waving
his
hand
the
statutes
of
mortmain
he
rejoined
can
t
prevent
my
bequeathing
my
property
to
an
individual
i
shall
leave
vange
abbey
to
you
now
father
benwell
have
i
got
the
better
of
you
at
last
with
christian
humility
the
jesuit
accepted
the
defeat
for
which
he
had
paved
the
way
from
the
outset
of
the
interview
at
the
same
time
he
shuffled
all
personal
responsibility
off
his
own
shoulders
he
had
gained
the
victory
for
the
church
without
to
do
him
justice
thinking
of
himself
your
generosity
has
conquered
me
he
said
but
i
must
be
allowed
to
clear
myself
of
even
the
suspicion
of
an
interested
motive
on
the
day
when
your
will
is
executed
i
shall
write
to
the
general
of
our
order
at
rome
leaving
my
inheritance
to
him
this
proceeding
will
be
followed
by
a
deed
in
due
form
conveying
the
property
to
the
church
you
have
no
objection
to
my
taking
that
course
no
my
dear
romayne
words
are
useless
at
such
a
time
as
this
my
acts
shall
speak
for
me
i
am
too
agitated
to
say
more
let
us
talk
of
something
else
let
us
have
some
he
filled
the
glasses
he
offered
more
he
was
really
and
even
perceptibly
agitated
by
the
victory
that
he
had
won
but
one
last
necessity
now
confronted
him
the
necessity
of
placing
a
serious
obstacle
in
the
way
of
any
future
change
of
purpose
on
the
part
of
romayne
as
to
the
choice
of
that
obstacle
father
benwell
s
mind
had
been
made
up
for
some
time
past
what
it
i
had
to
say
to
you
he
resumed
surely
i
was
speaking
on
the
subject
of
your
future
life
you
are
very
kind
father
benwell
the
subject
has
little
interest
for
me
my
future
life
is
shaped
out
domestic
retirement
ennobled
by
religious
still
pacing
the
room
father
benwell
stopped
at
that
reply
and
put
his
hand
kindly
on
romayne
s
shoulder
we
don
t
allow
a
good
catholic
to
drift
into
domestic
retirement
who
is
worthy
of
better
things
he
said
the
church
romayne
wishes
to
make
use
of
you
i
never
flattered
any
one
in
my
life
but
i
may
say
before
your
face
what
i
have
said
behind
your
back
a
man
of
your
strict
sense
of
honor
of
your
intellect
of
your
high
aspirations
of
your
personal
charm
and
influence
is
not
a
man
whom
we
can
allow
to
run
to
waste
open
your
mind
my
friend
fairly
to
me
and
i
will
open
my
mind
fairly
to
you
let
me
set
the
example
i
say
it
with
authority
an
enviable
future
is
before
romayne
s
pale
cheeks
flushed
with
excitement
what
future
he
asked
eagerly
am
i
free
to
choose
must
i
remind
you
that
a
man
with
a
wife
can
not
think
only
of
himself
suppose
you
were
a
man
with
a
what
do
you
mean
romayne
i
am
trying
to
break
my
way
through
that
inveterate
reserve
which
is
one
of
the
failings
in
your
character
unless
you
can
prevail
on
yourself
to
tell
me
those
secret
thoughts
those
unexpressed
regrets
which
you
can
confide
to
no
other
man
this
conversation
must
come
to
an
end
is
there
no
yearning
in
your
inmost
soul
for
anything
beyond
the
position
which
you
now
occupy
there
was
a
pause
the
flush
on
romayne
s
face
faded
away
he
was
silent
you
are
not
in
the
confessional
father
benwell
reminded
him
with
melancholy
submission
to
circumstances
you
are
under
no
obligation
to
answer
romayne
roused
himself
he
spoke
in
low
reluctant
tones
i
am
afraid
to
answer
you
he
said
that
apparently
discouraging
reply
armed
father
benwell
with
the
absolute
confidence
of
success
which
he
had
thus
far
failed
to
feel
he
wound
his
way
deeper
and
deeper
into
romayne
s
mind
with
the
delicate
ingenuity
of
penetration
of
which
the
practice
of
years
had
made
him
master
perhaps
i
have
failed
to
make
myself
clearly
understood
he
said
i
will
try
to
put
it
more
plainly
you
are
no
man
romayne
what
you
believe
you
believe
fervently
impressions
are
not
dimly
and
slowly
produced
on
mind
as
the
necessary
result
your
conversion
being
once
accomplished
your
whole
soul
is
given
to
the
faith
that
is
in
you
do
i
read
your
character
rightly
so
far
as
i
know
it
father
benwell
went
on
bear
in
mind
what
i
have
just
said
he
resumed
and
you
will
understand
why
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
press
the
question
which
you
have
not
answered
yet
you
have
found
in
the
catholic
faith
the
peace
of
mind
which
you
have
failed
to
obtain
by
other
means
if
i
had
been
dealing
with
an
ordinary
man
i
should
have
expected
from
the
change
no
happier
result
than
this

i
ask
you
has
that
blessed
influence
taken
no
deeper
and
nobler
hold
on
your
heart
can
you
truly
say
to
me
i
am
content
with
what
i
have
gained
i
wish
for
no
more
i
can
not
truly
say
it
romayne
answered
the
time
had
now
come
for
speaking
plainly
father
benwell
no
longer
advanced
to
his
end
under
cover
of
a
cloud
of
words
a
little
while
since
he
said
you
spoke
of
penrose
as
of
a
man
whose
lot
in
life
you
longed
to
share
the
career
which
has
associated
him
with
an
indian
mission
is
as
i
told
you
only
adapted
to
a
man
of
his
special
character
and
special
gifts
but
the
career
which
has
carried
him
into
the
sacred
ranks
of
the
priesthood
is
open
to
every
man
who
feels
the
sense
of
divine
vocation
which
has
made
penrose
one
of
no
father
benwell
not
open
to
every
i
say
yes
it
is
not
open
to
me
i
say
it
is
open
to
you
and
more
i
enjoin
i
command
you
to
dismiss
from
your
mind
all
merely
human
obstacles
and
discouragements
they
are
beneath
the
notice
of
a
man
who
feels
himself
called
to
the
priesthood
give
me
your
hand
romayne
does
your
conscience
tell
you
that
you
are
that
man
romayne
started
to
his
feet
shaken
to
the
soul
by
the
solemnity
of
the
appeal
i
can
t
dismiss
the
obstacles
that
surround
me
he
cried
passionately
to
a
man
in
my
position
your
advice
is
absolutely
useless
the
ties
that
bind
me
are
beyond
the
limit
of
a
priest
s
nothing
is
beyond
the
limit
of
a
priest
s
father
benwell
i
am
married
father
benwell
folded
his
arms
over
his
breast
looked
with
immovable
resolution
straight
in
romayne
s
face
and
struck
the
blow
which
he
had
been
meditating
for
months
past
rouse
your
courage
he
said
sternly
you
are
no
more
married
than
i
chapter
iv
on
the
road
to
rome
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
room
romayne
stood
looking
at
the
priest
did
you
hear
what
i
said
father
benwell
asked
do
you
understand
that
i
really
mean
what
i
said
he
made
no
reply
he
waited
like
a
man
expecting
to
hear
more
father
benwell
was
alive
to
the
vast
importance
at
such
a
moment
of
not
shrinking
from
the
responsibility
which
he
had
assumed
i
see
how
i
distress
you
he
said
but
for
your
sake
i
am
bound
to
speak
out
romayne
the
woman
whom
you
have
married
is
the
wife
of
another
man
don
t
ask
me
how
i
know
it
i
do
know
it
you
shall
have
positive
proof
as
soon
as
you
have
recovered
come
rest
a
little
in
the
he
took
romayne
s
arm
and
led
him
to
the
chair
and
made
him
drink
some
wine
they
waited
a
while
romayne
lifted
his
head
with
a
heavy
sigh
the
woman
whom
i
have
married
is
the
wife
of
another
he
slowly
repeated
the
words
to
himself
and
then
looked
at
father
benwell
who
is
the
man
he
asked
i
introduced
you
to
him
when
i
was
as
ignorant
of
the
circumstances
as
you
are
the
priest
answered
the
man
is
bernard
romayne
half
raised
himself
from
the
chair
a
momentary
anger
glittered
in
his
eyes
and
faded
out
again
extinguished
by
the
nobler
emotions
of
grief
and
shame
he
remembered
winterfield
s
introduction
to
stella
her
husband
he
said
speaking
again
to
himself
and
she
let
me
introduce
him
to
her
and
she
received
him
like
a
he
paused
and
thought
of
it
the
proofs
if
you
please
sir
he
resumed
with
sudden
humility
i
don
t
want
to
hear
any
particulars
it
will
be
enough
for
me
if
i
know
beyond
all
doubt
that
i
have
been
deceived
and
father
benwell
unlocked
his
desk
and
placed
two
papers
before
romayne
he
did
his
duty
with
a
grave
indifference
to
all
minor
considerations
the
time
had
not
yet
come
for
expressions
of
sympathy
and
regret
the
first
paper
he
said
is
a
certified
copy
of
the
register
of
the
marriage
of
miss
eyrecourt
to
winterfield
celebrated
as
you
will
see
by
the
english
chaplain
at
brussels
and
witnessed
by
three
persons
look
at
the
the
bride
s
mother
was
the
first
witness
the
two
names
that
followed
were
the
names
of
lord
and
lady
loring
too
in
the
conspiracy
to
deceive
me
romayne
said
as
he
laid
the
paper
back
on
the
table
i
obtained
that
piece
of
written
evidence
father
benwell
proceeded
by
the
help
of
a
reverend
colleague
of
mine
residing
at
brussels
i
will
give
you
his
name
and
address
if
you
wish
to
make
further
quite
needless
what
is
this
other
paper
this
other
paper
is
an
extract
from
the
writer
s
notes
suppressed
in
the
reports
of
the
public
journals
of
proceedings
in
an
english
court
of
law
obtained
at
my
request
by
my
lawyer
in
what
have
i
to
do
with
it
he
put
the
question
in
a
tone
of
passive
endurance
resigned
to
the
severest
moral
martyrdom
that
could
be
inflicted
on
him
i
will
answer
you
in
two
words
said
father
benwell
in
justice
to
miss
eyrecourt
i
am
bound
to
produce
her
excuse
for
marrying
romayne
looked
at
him
in
stern
amazement
excuse
he
repeated
yes
excuse
the
proceedings
to
which
i
have
alluded
declare
miss
eyrecourt
s
marriage
to
winterfield
to
be
null
and
void
by
the
english
law
in
consequence
of
his
having
been
married
at
the
time
to
another
woman
try
to
follow
me
i
will
put
it
as
briefly
as
possible
in
justice
to
yourself
and
to
your
future
career
you
must
understand
this
revolting
case
thoroughly
from
beginning
to
with
those
prefatory
words
he
told
the
story
of
winterfield
s
first
marriage
altering
nothing
concealing
nothing
doing
the
fullest
justice
to
winterfield
s
innocence
of
all
evil
motive
from
first
to
last
when
the
plain
truth
served
his
purpose
as
it
most
assuredly
did
in
this
case
the
man
has
never
yet
been
found
who
could
match
father
benwell
at
stripping
himself
of
every
vestige
of
reserve
and
exhibiting
his
naked
heart
to
the
moral
admiration
of
mankind
you
were
mortified
and
i
was
surprised
he
went
on
when
winterfield
dropped
his
acquaintance
with
you
we
now
know
that
he
acted
like
an
honorable
he
waited
to
see
what
effect
he
had
produced
romayne
was
in
no
state
of
mind
to
do
justice
to
winterfield
or
to
any
one
his
pride
was
mortally
wounded
his
high
sense
of
honor
and
delicacy
writhed
under
the
outrage
inflicted
on
it
and
mind
this
father
benwell
persisted
poor
human
nature
has
its
right
to
all
that
can
be
justly
conceded
in
the
way
of
excuse
and
allowance
miss
eyrecourt
would
naturally
be
advised
by
her
friends
would
naturally
be
eager
on
her
own
part
to
keep
hidden
from
you
what
happened
at
brussels
a
sensitive
woman
placed
in
a
position
so
horribly
false
and
degrading
must
not
be
too
severely
judged
even
when
she
does
wrong
i
am
bound
to
say
this
and
more
speaking
from
my
own
knowledge
of
all
the
parties
i
have
no
doubt
that
miss
eyrecourt
and
winterfield
did
really
part
at
the
church
romayne
answered
by
a
look
so
disdainfully
expressive
of
the
most
immovable
unbelief
that
it
absolutely
justified
the
fatal
advice
by
which
stella
s
friends
had
encouraged
her
to
conceal
the
truth
father
benwell
prudently
closed
his
lips
he
had
put
the
case
with
perfect
fairness
his
bitterest
enemy
could
not
have
denied
that
romayne
took
up
the
second
paper
looked
at
it
and
threw
it
back
again
on
the
table
with
an
expression
of
disgust
you
told
me
just
now
he
said
that
i
was
married
to
the
wife
of
another
man
and
there
is
the
judge
s
decision
releasing
miss
eyrecourt
from
her
marriage
to
winterfield
may
i
ask
you
to
explain
yourself
certainly
let
me
first
remind
you
that
you
owe
religious
allegiance
to
the
principles
which
the
church
has
asserted
for
centuries
past
with
all
the
authority
of
its
divine
institution
you
admit
that
i
admit
now
listen
in
church
romayne
marriage
is
even
more
than
a
religious
institution
it
is
a
sacrament
we
acknowledge
no
human
laws
which
profane
that
sacrament
take
two
examples
of
what
i
say
when
the
great
napoleon
was
at
the
height
of
his
power
pius
the
seventh
refused
to
acknowledge
the
validity
of
the
emperor
s
second
marriage
to
maria
louisa
while
josephine
was
living
divorced
by
the
french
senate
again
in
the
face
of
the
royal
marriage
act
the
church
sanctioned
the
marriage
of
fitzherbert
to
george
the
fourth
and
still
declares
in
justice
to
her
memory
that
she
was
the
king
s
lawful
wife
in
one
word
marriage
to
marriage
at
all
must
be
the
object
of
a
purely
religious
celebration
and
this
condition
complied
with
marriage
is
only
to
be
dissolved
by
death
you
remember
what
i
told
you
of
winterfield
yes
his
first
marriage
took
place
before
the
in
plain
english
romayne
winterfield
and
the
in
the
circus
pronounced
a
formula
of
words
before
a
layman
in
an
office
that
is
not
only
no
marriage
it
is
a
blasphemous
profanation
of
a
holy
rite
acts
of
parliament
which
sanction
such
proceedings
are
acts
of
infidelity
the
church
declares
it
in
defense
of
i
understand
you
said
romayne
mr
winterfield
s
marriage
at
brussels
which
the
english
law
father
benwell
interposed
declares
to
be
annulled
by
the
marriage
before
the
registrar
stands
good
nevertheless
by
the
higher
law
of
the
church
winterfield
is
miss
eyrecourt
s
husband
as
long
as
they
both
live
an
ordained
priest
performed
the
ceremony
in
a
consecrated
building
and
protestant
marriages
so
celebrated
are
marriages
acknowledged
by
the
catholic
church
under
those
circumstances
the
ceremony
which
afterward
united
you
to
miss
eyrecourt
though
neither
you
nor
the
clergyman
were
to
blame
was
a
mere
mockery
need
i
to
say
any
more
shall
i
leave
you
for
a
while
by
yourself
no
i
don
t
know
what
i
may
think
i
don
t
know
what
i
may
do
if
you
leave
me
by
father
benwell
took
a
chair
by
romayne
s
side
it
has
been
my
hard
duty
to
grieve
and
humiliate
you
he
said
do
you
bear
me
no
ill
will
he
held
out
his
hand
romayne
took
it
as
an
act
of
justice
if
not
as
an
act
of
gratitude
can
i
be
of
any
use
in
advising
you
father
benwell
asked
who
can
advise
a
man
in
my
position
romayne
bitterly
rejoined
i
can
at
least
suggest
that
you
should
take
time
to
think
over
your
time
take
time
you
talk
as
if
my
situation
was
everything
is
endurable
romayne
it
may
be
so
to
you
father
benwell
did
you
part
with
your
humanity
when
you
put
on
the
black
robe
of
the
priest
i
parted
my
son
with
those
weaknesses
of
humanity
on
which
women
practice
you
talk
of
your
position
i
will
put
it
before
you
at
its
for
what
purpose
to
show
you
exactly
what
you
have
now
to
decide
judged
by
the
law
of
england
romayne
is
your
wife
judged
by
the
principles
held
sacred
among
the
religious
community
to
which
you
belong
she
is
not
romayne
she
is
winterfield
living
with
you
in
adultery
if
you
regret
your
conversion
i
don
t
regret
it
father
if
you
renounce
the
holy
aspirations
which
you
have
yourself
acknowledged
to
me
return
to
your
domestic
life
but
don
t
ask
us
while
you
are
living
with
that
lady
to
respect
you
as
a
member
of
our
romayne
was
silent
the
more
violent
emotions
aroused
in
him
had
with
time
subsided
into
calm
tenderness
mercy
past
affection
found
their
opportunity
and
pleaded
with
him
the
priest
s
bold
language
had
missed
the
object
at
which
it
aimed
it
had
revived
in
romayne
s
memory
the
image
of
stella
in
the
days
when
he
had
first
seen
her
how
gently
her
influence
had
wrought
on
him
for
good
how
tenderly
how
truly
she
had
loved
him
give
me
some
more
wine
he
cried
i
feel
faint
and
giddy
don
t
despise
me
father
benwell
i
was
once
so
fond
of
her
the
priest
poured
out
the
wine
i
feel
for
you
he
said
indeed
indeed
i
feel
for
it
was
not
all
a
lie
there
were
grains
of
truth
in
that
outburst
of
sympathy
father
benwell
was
not
wholly
merciless
his
intellect
his
daring
duplicity
carried
him
straight
on
to
his
end
in
view
but
that
end
once
gained
and
let
it
be
remembered
not
gained
in
this
case
wholly
for
himself
there
were
compassionate
impulses
left
in
him
which
sometimes
forced
their
way
to
the
surface
a
man
of
high
intelligence
however
he
may
misuse
it
however
unworthy
he
may
be
of
it
has
a
gift
from
heaven
when
you
want
to
see
unredeemed
wickedness
look
for
it
in
a
fool
let
me
mention
one
circumstance
father
benwell
proceeded
which
may
help
to
relieve
you
for
the
moment
in
your
present
state
of
mind
you
can
not
return
to
the
impossible
i
have
had
a
room
prepared
for
you
in
this
house
here
free
from
any
disturbing
influence
you
can
shape
the
future
course
of
your
life
if
you
wish
to
communicate
with
your
residence
at
highgate
don
t
speak
of
it
father
benwell
sighed
ah
i
understand
he
said
sadly
the
house
associated
with
winterfield
s
visit
romayne
again
interrupted
him
this
time
by
gesture
only
the
hand
that
had
made
the
sign
clinched
itself
when
it
rested
afterward
on
the
table
his
eyes
looked
downward
under
frowning
brows
at
the
name
of
winterfield
remembrances
that
poisoned
every
better
influence
in
him
rose
venomously
in
his
mind
once
more
he
loathed
the
deceit
that
had
been
practiced
on
him
once
more
the
detestable
doubt
of
that
asserted
parting
at
the
church
door
renewed
its
stealthy
torment
and
reasoned
with
him
as
if
in
words
she
has
deceived
you
in
one
thing
why
not
in
another
can
i
see
my
lawyer
here
he
asked
suddenly
my
dear
romayne
you
can
see
any
one
whom
you
like
to
i
shall
not
trouble
you
by
staying
very
long
father
do
nothing
in
a
hurry
my
son
pray
do
nothing
in
a
hurry
romayne
paid
no
attention
to
this
entreaty
shrinking
from
the
momentous
decision
that
awaited
him
his
mind
instinctively
took
refuge
in
the
prospect
of
change
of
scene
i
shall
leave
england
he
said
impatiently
not
alone
father
benwell
remonstrated
who
will
be
my
companion
i
will
the
priest
answered
romayne
s
weary
eyes
brightened
faintly
in
his
desolate
position
father
benwell
was
the
one
friend
on
whom
he
could
rely
penrose
was
far
away
the
lorings
had
helped
to
keep
him
deceived
major
hynd
had
openly
pitied
and
despised
him
as
a
victim
to
priestcraft
can
you
go
with
me
at
any
time
he
asked
have
you
no
duties
that
keep
you
in
england
my
duties
romayne
are
already
confided
to
other
then
you
have
foreseen
this
i
have
thought
it
possible
your
journey
may
be
long
or
it
may
be
short
you
shall
not
go
away
i
can
think
of
nothing
yet
my
mind
is
a
blank
romayne
confessed
sadly
i
don
t
know
where
i
shall
i
know
where
you
ought
to
go
and
where
you
go
said
father
benwell
emphatically
where
to
romayne
understood
the
true
meaning
of
that
brief
reply
a
vague
sense
of
dismay
began
to
rise
in
his
mind
while
he
was
still
tortured
by
doubt
it
seemed
as
if
father
benwell
had
by
some
inscrutable
process
of
prevision
planned
out
his
future
beforehand
had
the
priest
foreseen
events
no
he
had
only
foreseen
possibilities
on
the
day
when
it
first
occurred
to
him
that
romayne
s
marriage
was
assailable
before
the
court
of
romayne
s
conscience
from
the
roman
catholic
point
of
view
by
this
means
the
misfortune
of
romayne
s
marriage
having
preceded
his
conversion
might
be
averted
and
the
one
certain
obstacle
in
the
way
of
any
change
of
purpose
on
his
part
the
obstacle
of
the
priesthood
might
still
be
set
up
by
the
voluntary
separation
of
the
husband
from
the
wife
thus
far
the
jesuit
had
modestly
described
himself
to
his
reverend
colleagues
as
regarding
his
position
toward
romayne
in
a
new
light
his
next
letter
might
boldly
explain
to
them
what
he
had
really
meant
the
triumph
was
won
not
a
word
more
passed
between
his
guest
and
himself
that
morning
before
on
the
same
day
father
benwell
wrote
his
last
report
to
the
secretary
of
the
society
of
jesus
in
these
lines
romayne
is
free
from
the
domestic
ties
that
bound
him
he
leaves
it
to
me
to
restore
vange
abbey
to
the
church
and
he
acknowledges
a
vocation
for
the
priesthood

you
and
i
cousin
beeminster
seldom
meet
but
i
occasionally
hear
of
you
from
friends
acquainted
with
both
of
us
i
have
heard
of
you
last
at
sir
philip
s
dinner
a
week
since
my
name
happened
to
be
mentioned
by
one
of
the
gentlemen
present
a
guest
like
yourself
you
took
up
the
subject
of
your
own
free
will
and
spoke
of
me
in
these
terms
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
of
the
existing
head
of
the
family
but
bernard
is
really
unfit
for
the
position
which
he
holds
he
has
to
say
the
least
of
it
compromised
himself
and
his
relatives
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
began
as
a
young
man
by
marrying
a
he
got
into
some
other
scrape
after
that
which
he
has
contrived
to
keep
a
secret
from
us
we
only
know
how
disgraceful
it
must
have
been
by
the
results
he
was
a
voluntary
exile
from
england
for
more
than
a
year
and
now
to
complete
the
list
he
has
mixed
himself
up
in
that
miserable
and
revolting
business
of
lewis
romayne
and
his
if
any
other
person
had
spoken
of
me
in
this
manner
i
should
have
set
him
down
as
a
mischievous
idiot
to
be
kicked
perhaps
but
not
to
be
noticed
in
any
other
way
with
you
the
case
is
different
if
i
die
without
male
offspring
the
beaupark
estate
goes
to
you
as
next
heir
i
don
t
choose
to
let
a
man
in
this
position
slander
me
and
those
dear
to
me
without
promptly
contradicting
him
the
name
i
bear
is
precious
to
me
in
memory
of
my
father
your
unanswered
allusion
to
my
relations
with
lewis
romayne
and
his
wife
coming
from
a
member
of
the
family
will
be
received
as
truth
rather
than
let
this
be
i
reveal
to
you
without
reserve
some
of
the
saddest
passages
of
my
life
i
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
and
if
i
have
hitherto
kept
certain
events
in
the
dark
it
has
been
for
the
sake
of
others
not
for
my
own
sake
i
know
better
now
a
woman
s
reputation
if
she
is
a
good
woman
is
not
easily
compromised
by
telling
the
truth
the
person
of
whom
i
am
thinking
when
i
write
this
knows
what
i
am
going
to
do
and
approves
of
it

will
receive
with
these

the
most
perfectly
candid
statement
that
i
can
furnish

extracts
cut
out
of
my
own
private
diary
they
are
accompanied
where
plain
necessity
seems
to
call
for
it
by
the
written
evidence
of
other
persons
there
has
never
been
much
sympathy
between
us
but
you
have
been
brought
up
like
a
gentleman
and
when
you
have
read
my
narrative
i
expect
that
you
will
do
justice
to
me
and
to

acted
indiscreetly

trying

critical
circumstances

april
mrs
eyrecourt
and
her
daughter
have
left
beaupark
for
london
have
i
really
made
any
impression
on
the
heart
of
the
beautiful
stella
in
my
miserable
position
ignorant
whether
i
am
free
or
not
i
have
shrunk
from
formally
acknowledging
that
i
love
her
i
am
becoming
superstitious

of

the
death
is
recorded
of
that
unhappy
woman
whom
i
was
mad
enough
to
marry
after
hearing
nothing
of
her
for
seven
years
i
am
free
surely
this
is
a
good
omen
shall
i
follow
the
eyrecourts
to
london
and
declare
myself
i
have
not
confidence
enough
in
my
own
power
of
attraction
to
run
the
risk

point
of
leaving
for

stella
is
restless
and
dissatisfied
she
wants
change
of
scene
and
eyrecourt
adds
in
so
many
words
it
is
you
who
have
upset
her
why
did
you
not
speak
while
we
were
at
beaupark
i
am
to
hear
again
from
paris
good
old
father
newbliss
said
all
along
that
she
was
fond
of
me
and
wondered
like
eyrecourt
why
i
failed
to
declare
myself
how
could
i
tell
them
of
the
hideous
fetters
which
bound
me
in
those
days
she
has
accepted
me
words
are
useless
to
express
my
happiness
a
letter
from
my
lawyer
full
of
professional
subtleties
and
delays
i
have
no
patience
to
enumerate
them
we
move
to
belgium
not
on
our
way
back
to
england
stella
is
so
little
desirous
of
leaving
the
continent
that
we
are
likely
to
be
married
abroad
but
she
is
weary
of
the
perpetual
gayety
and
glitter
of
paris
and
wants
to
see
the
old
belgian
cities
her
mother
leaves
paris
with
regret
the
liveliest
woman
of
her
age
that
i
ever
met
with
brussels
may
my
blessing
on
the
old
belgian
cities
eyrecourt
is
so
eager
to
get
away
from
them
that
she
backs
me
in
hurrying
the
marriage
and
even
consents
sorely
against
the
grain
to
let
the
wedding
be
celebrated
at
brussels
in
a
private
and
unpretending
way
she
has
only
stipulated
that
lord
and
lady
loring
old
friends
shall
be
present
they
are
to
arrive
tomorrow
and
two
days
afterward
we
are
to
be
married
an
inclosure
is
inserted
in
this
place
it
consists
of
the
confession
of
winterfield
s
wife
and
of
the
explanatory
letter
written
by
the
rector
of
belhaven

circumstances
related
in

to
infer
that

has
been
broken
off

back

kind
and
comforting

i
suppose
help
me
to
bear
my
sad
lot
perhaps
a
day
may
come
when
stella
and
her
friends
will
know
how
cruelly
they
have
wronged
me
london
november
the
old
wound
has
been
opened
again
i
met
her
accidentally
in
a
picture
gallery
she
turned
deadly
pale
and
left
the
place
oh
stella
stella
london
august
another
meeting
with
her
and
another
shock
to
endure
which
i
might
not
have
suffered
if
i
had
been
a
reader
of
the
marriage
announcements
in
the
newspapers
like
other
men
i
am
in
the
habit
of
leaving
the
marriage
announcements
to
the
women
i
went
to
visit
an
agreeable
new
acquaintance
romayne
his
wife
drove
up
to
the
house
while
i
was
looking
out
of
window
i
recognized
stella
after
two
years
she
has
made
use
of
the
freedom
which
the
law
has
given
to
her
i
must
not
complain
of
that
or
of
her
treating
me
like
a
stranger
when
her
husband
innocently
introduced
us
but
when
are
were
afterward
left
together
for
a
few
minutes
no
i
can
not
write
down
the
merciless
words
she
said
to
me
why
am
i
fool
enough
to
be
as
fond
of
her
as
ever
beaupark
november
stella
s
married
life
is
not
likely
to
be
a
happy
one
s
newspaper
announces
the
conversion
of
her
husband
to
the
roman
catholic
faith
i
can
honestly
say
i
am
sorry
for
her
knowing
how
she
has
suffered
among
her
own
relatives
by
these
conversions
but
i
so
hate
him
that
this
proof
of
his
weakness
is
a
downright
consolation
to
me
beaupark
january
a
letter
from
stella
so
startling
and
deplorable
that
i
can
not
remain
away
from
her
after
reading
it
her
husband
has
deliberately
deserted
her
he
has
gone
to
rome
to
serve
his
term
of
probation
for
the
priesthood
i
travel
to
london
by
s
train
london
january
short
as
it
is
i
looked
at
stella
s
letter
again
and
again
on
the
journey
the
tone
of
the
closing
sentences
is
still
studiously
cold
after
informing
me
that
she
is
staying
with
her
mother
in
london
she
concludes
her
letter
in
these
terms
be
under
no
fear
that
the
burden
of
my
troubles
will
be
laid
on
your
shoulders
since
the
fatal
day
when
we
met
at
ten
acres
you
have
shown
forbearance
and
compassion
toward
me
i
don
t
stop
to
inquire
if
you
are
sincere
it
rests
with
you
to
prove
that
but
i
have
some
questions
to
ask
which
no
person
but
you
can
answer
for
the
rest
my
friendless
position
will
perhaps
plead
with
you
not
to
misunderstand
me
may
i
write
again
inveterate
distrust
in
every
sentence
if
any
other
woman
had
treated
me
in
this
way
i
should
have
put
her
letter
into
the
fire
and
should
not
have
stirred
from
my
comfortable
house
january
a
day
missed
out
of
my
diary
the
events
of
yesterday
unnerved
me
for
the
time
arriving
at
derwent
s
hotel
on
the
evening
of
the
i
sent
a
line
to
stella
by
messenger
to
ask
when
she
could
receive
me
it
is
strange
how
the
merest
trifles
seem
to
touch
women
her
note
in
reply
contains
the
first
expression
of
friendly
feeling
toward
me
which
has
escaped
her
since
we
parted
at
brussels
and
this
expression
proceeds
from
her
ungovernable
surprise
and
gratitude
at
my
taking
the
trouble
to
travel
from
devonshire
to
london
on
her
account
for
the
rest
she
proposed
to
call
on
me
at
the
hotel
the
next
morning
she
and
her
mother
it
appeared
differed
in
opinion
on
the
subject
of
romayne
s
behavior
to
her
and
she
wished
to
see
me
in
the
first
instance
unrestrained
by
eyrecourt
s
interference
there
was
little
sleep
for
me
that
night
i
passed
most
of
the
time
in
smoking
and
walking
up
and
down
the
room
my
one
relief
was
afforded
by
traveler
he
begged
so
hard
to
go
to
london
with
me
i
could
not
resist
him
the
dog
always
sleeps
in
my
room
his
surprise
at
my
extraordinary
restlessness
ending
in
downright
anxiety
and
alarm
was
expressed
in
his
eyes
and
in
his
little
whinings
and
cries
quite
as
intelligibly
as
if
he
had
put
his
meaning
into
words
who
first
called
a
dog
a
dumb
creature
it
must
have
been
a
man
i
think
and
a
thoroughly
unlovable
man
too
from
a
dog
s
point
of
view
soon
after
ten
on
the
morning
of
the
she
entered
my
in
her
personal
appearance
i
saw
a
change
for
the
worse
produced
i
suppose
by
the
troubles
that
have
tried
her
sorely
poor
thing
there
was
a
sad
loss
of
delicacy
in
her
features
and
of
purity
in
her
complexion
even
her
dress
i
should
certainly
not
have
noticed
it
in
any
other
woman
seemed
to
be
loose
and
slovenly
in
the
agitation
of
the
moment
i
forgot
the
long
estrangement
between
us
i
half
lifted
my
hand
to
take
hers
and
checked
myself
was
i
mistaken
in
supposing
that
she
yielded
to
the
same
impulse
and
resisted
it
as
i
did
she
concealed
her
embarrassment
if
she
felt
any
by
patting
the
dog
i
am
ashamed
that
you
should
have
taken
the
journey
to
london
in
this
wintry
weather
she
began
it
was
impossible
in
her
situation
to
let
her
assume
this
commonplace
tone
with
me
i
sincerely
feel
for
you
i
said
and
sincerely
wish
to
help
you
if
i
she
looked
at
me
for
the
first
time
did
she
believe
me
or
did
she
still
doubt
before
i
could
decide
she
took
a
letter
from
her
pocket
opened
it
and
handed
it
to
me
women
often
exaggerate
their
troubles
she
said
it
is
perhaps
an
unfair
trial
of
your
patience
but
i
should
like
you
to
satisfy
yourself
that
i
have
not
made
the
worst
of
my
situation
that
letter
will
place
it
before
you
in
romayne
s
own
words
read
it
except
where
the
page
is
turned
it
was
her
husband
s
letter
of
farewell
the
language
was
scrupulously
delicate
and
considerate
but
to
my
mind
it
entirely
failed
to
disguise
the
fanatical
cruelty
of
the
man
s
resolution
addressed
to
his
wife
in
substance
it
came
to
this
he
had
discovered
the
marriage
at
brussels
which
she
had
deliberately
concealed
from
him
when
he
took
her
for
his
wife
she
had
afterward
persisted
in
that
concealment
under
circumstances
which
made
it
impossible
that
he
could
ever
trust
her
this
no
doubt
referred
to
her
reception
of
me
as
a
total
stranger
at
ten
acres
lodge
in
the
miserable
of
his
domestic
life
the
church
to
which
he
now
belonged
offered
him
not
only
her
divine
consolation
but
the
honor
above
all
earthly
distinctions
of
serving
the
cause
of
religion
in
the
sacred
ranks
of
the
priesthood
before
his
departure
for
rome
he
bade
her
a
last
farewell
in
this
world
and
forgave
her
the
injuries
that
she
had
inflicted
on
him
for
her
sake
he
asked
leave
to
say
some
few
words
more
in
the
first
place
he
desired
to
do
her
every
justice
in
a
worldly
sense
ten
acres
lodge
was
offered
to
her
as
a
free
gift
for
her
lifetime
with
a
sufficient
income
for
all
her
wants
in
the
second
place
he
was
anxious
that
she
should
not
misinterpret
his
motives
whatever
his
opinion
of
her
conduct
might
be
he
did
not
rely
on
it
as
affording
his
only
justification
for
leaving
her
setting
personal
feeling
aside
he
felt
religious
scruples
connected
with
his
marriage
which
left
him
no
other
alternative
than
the
separation
on
which
he
had
resolved
he
would
briefly
explain
those
scruples
and
mention
his
authority
for
entertaining
them
before
he
closed
his
there
the
page
was
turned
down
and
the
explanation
was
concealed
from
me
a
faint
color
stole
over
her
face
as
i
handed
the
letter
back
to
her
it
is
needless
for
you
to
read
the
end
she
said
you
know
under
his
own
hand
that
he
has
left
me
and
if
such
a
thing
pleads
with
you
in
his
favor
you
also
know
that
he
is
liberal
in
providing
for
his
deserted
i
attempted
to
speak
she
saw
in
my
face
how
i
despised
him
and
stopped
me
whatever
you
may
think
of
his
conduct
she
continued
i
beg
that
you
will
not
speak
of
it
to
me
may
i
ask
your
opinion
now
you
have
read
his
letter
on
another
matter
in
which
my
own
conduct
is
concerned
in
former
days
she
paused
poor
soul
in
evident
confusion
and
distress
why
speak
of
those
days
i
ventured
to
say
i
must
speak
of
them
in
former
days
i
think
you
were
told
that
my
father
s
will
provided
for
my
mother
and
for
me
you
know
that
we
have
enough
to
live
on
i
had
heard
of
it
at
the
time
of
our
betrothal
when
the
marriage
settlement
was
in
preparation
the
mother
and
daughter
had
each
a
little
income
of
a
few
hundreds
a
year
the
exact
amount
had
escaped
my
memory
after
answering
her
to
this
effect
i
waited
to
hear
more
she
suddenly
became
silent
the
most
painful
embarrassment
showed
itself
in
her
face
and
manner
never
mind
the
rest
she
said
mastering
her
confusion
after
an
interval
i
have
had
some
hard
trials
to
bear
i
forget
things
she
made
an
effort
to
finish
the
sentence
and
gave
it
up
and
called
to
the
dog
to
come
to
her
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
and
that
was
the
way
she
took
to
hide
them
from
me
in
general
i
am
not
quick
at
reading
the
minds
of
others
but
i
thought
i
understood
stella
now
that
we
were
face
to
face
the
impulse
to
trust
me
had
for
the
moment
got
the
better
of
her
caution
and
her
pride
she
was
half
ashamed
of
it
half
inclined
to
follow
it
i
hesitated
no
longer
the
time
for
which
i
had
waited
the
time
to
prove
without
any
indelicacy
on
my
side
that
i
had
never
been
unworthy
of
her
had
surely
come
at
last
do
you
remember
my
reply
to
your
letter
about
father
benwell
i
asked
yes
every
word
of
i
promised
if
you
ever
had
need
of
me
to
prove
that
i
had
never
been
unworthy
of
your
confidence
in
your
present
situation
i
can
honorably
keep
my
promise
shall
i
wait
till
you
are
calmer
or
shall
i
go
on
at
once
at
once
when
your
mother
and
your
friends
took
you
from
me
i
resumed
if
you
had
shown
any
hesitation
she
shuddered
the
image
of
my
unhappy
wife
vindictively
confronting
us
on
the
church
steps
seemed
to
be
recalled
to
her
memory
don
t
go
back
to
it
she
cried
spare
me
i
entreat
i
opened
the
in
which
i
keep
the
papers
sent
to
me
by
the
rector
of
belhaven
and
placed
them
on
the
table
by
which
she
was
sitting
the
more
plainly
and
briefly
i
spoke
now
the
better
i
thought
it
might
be
for
both
of
us
since
we
parted
at
brussels
i
said
my
wife
has
died
here
is
a
copy
of
the
medical
certificate
of
her
stella
refused
to
look
at
it
i
don
t
understand
such
things
she
answered
faintly
what
is
this
she
took
up
my
wife
s
confession
read
it
i
said
she
looked
frightened
what
will
it
tell
me
she
asked
it
will
tell
you
stella
that
false
appearances
once
led
you
into
wronging
an
innocent
having
said
this
i
walked
away
to
a
window
behind
her
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
so
that
she
might
not
see
me
while
she
read
after
a
time
how
much
longer
it
seemed
to
be
than
it
really
was
i
heard
her
move
as
i
turned
from
the
window
she
ran
to
me
and
fell
on
her
knees
at
my
feet
i
tried
to
raise
her
i
entreated
her
to
believe
that
she
was
forgiven
she
seized
my
hands
and
held
them
over
her
face
they
were
wet
with
her
tears
i
am
ashamed
to
look
at
you
she
said
oh
bernard
what
a
wretch
i
have
been
i
never
was
so
distressed
in
my
life
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
have
said
what
i
should
have
done
if
my
dear
old
dog
had
not
helped
me
out
of
it
he
too
ran
up
to
me
with
the
loving
jealousy
of
his
race
and
tried
to
lick
my
hands
still
fast
in
stella
s
hold
his
paws
were
on
her
shoulder
he
attempted
to
push
himself
between
us
i
think
i
successfully
assumed
a
tranquillity
which
i
was
far
from
really
feeling
come
come
i
said
you
mustn
t
make
traveler
she
let
me
raise
her
ah
if
she
could
have
kissed
but
that
was
not
to
be
done
she
kissed
the
dog
s
head
and
then
she
spoke
to
me
i
shall
not
set
down
what
she
said
in
these
pages
while
i
live
there
is
no
fear
of
my
forgetting
those
words
i
led
her
back
to
her
chair
the
letter
addressed
to
me
by
the
rector
of
belhaven
still
lay
on
the
table
unread
it
was
of
some
importance
to
stella
s
complete
enlightenment
as
containing
evidence
that
the
confession
was
genuine
but
i
hesitated
for
her
sake
to
speak
of
it
just
yet
now
you
know
that
you
have
a
friend
to
help
and
advise
you
i
began
no
she
interposed
more
than
a
friend
say
a
i
said
it
you
had
something
to
ask
of
me
i
resumed
and
you
never
put
the
she
understood
me
i
meant
to
tell
you
she
said
that
i
had
written
a
letter
of
refusal
to
romayne
s
lawyers
i
have
left
ten
acres
never
to
return
and
i
refuse
to
accept
a
farthing
of
romayne
s
money
my
mother
though
she
knows
that
we
have
enough
to
live
on
tells
me
i
have
acted
with
inexcusable
pride
and
folly
i
wanted
to
ask
if
you
blame
me
bernard
as
she
does
i
daresay
i
was
inexcusably
proud
and
foolish
too
it
was
the
second
time
she
had
called
me
by
my
christian
name
since
the
happy
bygone
time
never
to
come
again
under
whatever
influence
i
acted
i
respected
and
admired
her
for
that
refusal
and
i
owned
it
in
so
many
words
this
little
encouragement
seemed
to
relieve
her
she
was
so
much
calmer
that
i
ventured
to
speak
of
the
rector
s
letter
she
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
oh
bernard
have
i
not
learned
to
trust
you
yet
put
away
those
papers
there
is
only
one
thing
i
want
to
know
who
gave
them
to
you
the
rector
how
did
they
reach
you
then
through
father
she
started
at
that
name
like
a
woman
electrified
i
knew
it
she
cried
it
the
priest
who
has
wrecked
my
married
life
and
he
got
his
information
from
those
letters
before
he
put
them
into
your
she
waited
a
while
and
recovered
herself
that
was
the
first
of
the
questions
i
wanted
to
put
to
you
she
said
i
am
answered
i
ask
no
she
was
surely
wrong
about
father
benwell
i
tried
to
show
her
why
i
told
her
that
my
reverend
friend
had
put
the
letters
into
my
hand
with
the
seal
which
protected
them
unbroken
she
laughed
disdainfully
did
i
know
him
so
little
as
to
doubt
for
a
moment
that
he
could
break
a
seal
and
replace
it
again
this
view
was
entirely
new
to
me
i
was
startled
but
not
convinced
i
never
desert
my
friends
even
when
they
are
friends
of
no
very
long
standing
and
i
still
tried
to
defend
father
benwell
the
only
result
was
to
make
her
alter
her
intention
of
asking
me
no
more
questions
i
innocently
roused
in
her
a
new
curiosity
she
was
eager
to
know
how
i
had
first
become
acquainted
with
the
priest
and
how
he
had
contrived
to
possess
himself
of
papers
which
were
intended
for
my
reading
only
there
was
but
one
way
of
answering
her
it
was
far
from
easy
to
a
man
like
myself
unaccustomed
to
state
circumstances
in
their
proper
order
but
i
had
no
other
choice
than
to
reply
by
telling
the
long
story
of
the
theft
and
discovery
of
the
rector
s
papers
so
far
as
father
benwell
was
concerned
the
narrative
only
confirmed
her
suspicions
for
the
rest
the
circumstances
which
most
interested
her
were
the
circumstances
associated
with
the
french
boy
anything
connected
with
that
poor
creature
she
said
has
a
dreadful
interest
for
me
did
you
know
him
i
asked
with
some
surprise
i
knew
him
and
his
mother
you
shall
hear
how
at
another
time
i
suppose
i
felt
a
presentiment
that
the
boy
would
have
some
evil
influence
over
me
at
any
rate
when
i
accidentally
touched
him
i
trembled
as
if
i
had
touched
a
serpent
you
will
think
me
superstitious
but
after
what
you
have
said
it
is
certainly
true
that
he
has
been
the
indirect
cause
of
the
misfortune
that
has
fallen
on
me
how
came
he
to
steal
the
papers
did
you
ask
the
rector
when
you
went
to
belhaven
i
asked
the
rector
nothing
but
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
tell
me
all
that
he
knew
of
the
she
drew
her
chair
nearer
to
me
let
me
hear
every
word
of
it
she
pleaded
eagerly
i
felt
some
reluctance
to
comply
with
the
request
is
it
not
fit
for
me
to
hear
she
asked
this
forced
me
to
be
plain
with
her
if
i
repeat
what
the
rector
told
me
i
said
i
must
speak
of
my
she
took
my
hand
you
have
pitied
and
forgiven
her
she
answered
speak
of
her
bernard
and
don
t
for
god
s
sake
think
that
my
heart
is
harder
than
i
kissed
the
hand
that
she
had
given
to
me
even
her
brother
might
do
that
it
began
i
said
in
the
grateful
attachment
which
the
boy
felt
for
my
wife
he
refused
to
leave
her
bedside
on
the
day
when
she
dictated
her
confession
to
the
rector
as
he
was
entirely
ignorant
of
the
english
language
there
seemed
to
be
no
objection
to
letting
him
have
his
own
way
he
became
inquisitive
as
the
writing
went
on
his
questions
annoyed
the
rector
and
as
the
easiest
way
of
satisfying
his
curiosity
my
wife
told
him
that
she
was
making
her
will
he
knew
just
enough
from
what
he
had
heard
at
various
times
to
associate
making
a
will
with
gifts
of
money
and
the
pretended
explanation
silenced
and
satisfied
did
the
rector
understand
it
stella
asked
yes
like
many
other
englishmen
in
his
position
although
he
was
not
ready
at
speaking
french
he
could
read
the
language
and
could
fairly
well
understand
it
when
it
was
spoken
after
my
wife
s
death
he
kindly
placed
the
boy
for
a
few
days
under
the
care
of
his
housekeeper
her
early
life
had
been
passed
in
the
island
of
martinique
and
she
was
able
to
communicate
with
the
friendless
foreigner
in
his
own
language
when
he
disappeared
she
was
the
only
person
who
could
throw
any
light
on
his
motive
for
stealing
the
papers
on
the
day
when
he
entered
the
house
she
caught
him
peeping
through
the
keyhole
of
the
study
door
he
must
have
seen
where
the
confession
was
placed
and
the
color
of
the
blue
paper
on
which
it
was
written
would
help
him
to
identify
it
the
next
morning
during
the
rector
s
absence
he
brought
the
manuscript
to
the
housekeeper
and
asked
her
to
translate
it
into
french
so
that
he
might
know
how
much
money
was
left
to
him
in
the
she
severely
reproved
him
made
him
replace
the
paper
in
the
desk
from
which
he
had
taken
it
and
threatened
to
tell
the
rector
if
his
misconduct
was
repeated
he
promised
amendment
and
the
woman
believed
him
on
that
evening
the
papers
were
sealed
and
locked
up
in
the
morning
the
lock
was
found
broken
and
the
papers
and
the
boy
were
both
missing
do
you
think
he
showed
the
confession
to
any
other
person
stella
asked
i
happen
to
know
that
he
concealed
it
from
his
after
the
housekeeper
s
reproof
i
replied
he
would
be
cunning
enough
in
my
opinion
not
to
run
the
risk
of
showing
it
to
strangers
it
is
far
more
likely
that
he
thought
he
might
learn
english
enough
to
read
it
there
the
subject
dropped
we
were
silent
for
a
while
she
was
thinking
and
i
was
looking
at
her
on
a
sudden
she
raised
her
head
her
eyes
rested
on
me
gravely
it
is
very
strange
she
said
what
is
strange
i
have
been
thinking
of
the
lorings
they
encouraged
me
to
doubt
you
they
advised
me
to
be
silent
about
what
happened
at
brussels
and
they
too
are
concerned
in
my
husband
s
desertion
of
me
he
first
met
father
benwell
at
their
her
head
drooped
again
her
next
words
were
murmured
to
herself
i
am
still
a
young
woman
she
said
oh
god
what
is
my
future
to
be
this
morbid
way
of
thinking
distressed
me
i
reminded
her
that
she
had
dear
and
devoted
friends
not
one
she
answered
but
have
you
not
seen
lady
loring
i
asked
she
and
her
husband
have
written
most
kindly
inviting
me
to
make
their
house
my
home
i
have
no
right
to
blame
them
they
meant
well
but
after
what
has
happened
i
can
t
go
back
to
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
i
said
are
you
thinking
of
the
lorings
she
asked
i
don
t
even
know
the
lorings
i
can
think
of
nobody
but
i
was
still
looking
at
her
and
i
am
afraid
my
eyes
said
more
than
my
words
if
she
had
doubted
it
before
she
must
have
now
known
that
i
was
as
fond
of
her
as
ever
she
looked
distressed
rather
than
confused
i
made
an
awkward
attempt
to
set
myself
right
surely
your
brother
may
speak
plainly
i
pleaded
she
agreed
to
this
but
nevertheless
she
rose
to
go
with
a
friendly
word
intended
as
i
hoped
to
show
me
that
i
had
got
my
pardon
for
that
time
will
you
come
and
see
us
she
said
can
you
forgive
my
mother
as
generously
as
you
have
forgiven
me
i
will
take
care
bernard
that
she
does
you
justice
at
she
held
out
her
hand
to
take
leave
how
could
i
reply
if
i
had
been
a
resolute
man
i
might
have
remembered
that
it
would
be
best
for
me
not
to
see
too
much
of
her
but
i
am
a
poor
weak
creature
i
accepted
her
invitation
for
the
next
day
january
i
have
just
returned
from
my
visit
my
thoughts
are
in
a
state
of
indescribable
conflict
and
confusion
and
her
mother
is
the
cause
of
it
i
wish
i
had
not
gone
to
the
house
am
i
a
bad
man
i
wonder
and
have
i
only
found
it
out
now
eyrecourt
was
alone
in
the
when
i
went
in
judging
by
the
easy
manner
in
which
she
got
up
to
receive
me
the
misfortune
that
has
befallen
her
daughter
seemed
to
have
produced
no
sobering
change
in
this
frivolous
woman
my
dear
winterfield
she
began
i
have
behaved
infamously
i
won
t
say
that
appearances
were
against
you
at
brussels
i
will
only
say
i
ought
not
to
have
trusted
to
appearances
you
are
the
injured
person
please
forgive
me
shall
we
go
on
with
the
subject
or
shall
we
shake
hands
and
say
no
more
about
it
i
shook
hands
of
course
eyrecourt
perceived
that
i
was
looking
for
stella
sit
down
she
said
and
be
good
enough
to
put
up
with
no
more
attractive
society
than
mine
unless
i
set
things
straight
my
good
friend
you
and
my
daughter
oh
with
the
best
intentions
will
drift
into
a
false
position
you
won
t
see
stella
quite
impossible
and
i
will
tell
you
why
i
am
the
worldly
old
mother
i
don
t
mind
what
i
say
my
innocent
daughter
would
die
before
she
would
confess
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
can
i
offer
you
anything
have
you
had
lunch
i
begged
her
to
continue
she
perplexed
i
am
not
sure
that
she
did
not
even
alarm
me
very
well
she
proceeded
you
may
be
surprised
to
hear
it
but
i
don
t
mean
to
allow
things
to
go
on
in
this
way
my
contemptible
shall
return
to
his
this
startled
me
and
i
suppose
i
showed
it
wait
a
little
said
eyrecourt
there
is
nothing
to
be
alarmed
about
romayne
is
a
weak
fool
and
father
benwell
s
greedy
hands
are
of
course
in
both
his
pockets
but
he
has
unless
i
am
entirely
mistaken
some
small
sense
of
shame
and
some
little
human
feeling
still
left
after
the
manner
in
which
he
has
behaved
these
are
the
merest
possibilities
you
will
say
very
likely
i
have
boldly
appealed
to
those
possibilities
nevertheless
he
has
already
gone
away
to
rome
and
i
need
hardly
add
father
benwell
would
take
good
care
of
that
he
has
left
us
no
address
it
doesn
t
in
the
least
matter
one
of
the
advantages
of
being
so
much
in
society
as
i
am
is
that
i
have
nice
acquaintances
everywhere
always
ready
to
oblige
me
provided
i
don
t
borrow
money
of
them
i
have
written
to
romayne
under
cover
to
one
of
my
friends
living
in
rome
wherever
he
may
be
there
my
letter
will
find
so
far
i
listened
quietly
enough
naturally
supposing
that
eyrecourt
trusted
to
her
own
arguments
and
persuasions
i
confess
it
even
to
myself
with
shame
it
was
a
relief
to
me
to
feel
that
the
chances
with
such
a
fanatic
as
romayne
were
a
hundred
to
one
against
her
this
unworthy
way
of
thinking
was
instantly
checked
by
eyrecourt
s
next
words
don
t
suppose
that
i
am
foolish
enough
to
attempt
to
reason
with
him
she
went
on
my
letter
begins
and
ends
on
the
first
page
his
wife
has
a
claim
on
him
which
no
man
can
resist
let
me
do
him
justice
he
knew
nothing
of
it
before
he
went
away
my
letter
my
daughter
has
no
suspicion
that
i
have
written
it
tells
him
plainly
what
the
claim
she
paused
her
eyes
softened
her
voice
sank
low
she
became
quite
unlike
the
eyrecourt
whom
i
knew
in
a
few
months
more
winterfield
she
said
my
poor
stella
will
be
a
mother
my
letter
calls
romayne
back
to
his
wife
his
eyrecourt
paused
evidently
expecting
me
to
offer
an
opinion
of
some
sort
for
the
moment
i
was
really
unable
to
speak
stella
s
mother
never
had
a
very
high
opinion
of
my
abilities
she
now
appeared
to
consider
me
the
stupidest
person
in
the
circle
of
her
acquaintance
are
you
a
little
deaf
winterfield
she
asked
not
that
i
know
do
you
understand
me
oh
then
why
can
t
you
say
something
i
want
a
man
s
opinion
of
our
prospects
good
gracious
how
you
fidget
put
yourself
in
romayne
s
place
and
tell
me
this
if
had
left
stella
i
should
never
have
left
her
be
quiet
you
don
t
know
what
you
would
have
done
i
insist
on
your
supposing
yourself
to
be
a
weak
superstitious
conceited
fanatical
fool
you
understand
now
tell
me
then
could
you
keep
away
from
your
wife
when
you
were
called
back
to
her
in
the
name
of
your
firstborn
child
could
you
resist
that
most
assuredly
not
i
contrived
to
reply
with
an
appearance
of
tranquillity
it
was
not
very
easy
to
speak
with
composure
envious
selfish
contemptible
no
language
is
too
strong
to
describe
the
turn
my
thoughts
now
took
i
never
hated
any
human
being
as
i
hated
romayne
at
that
moment
damn
him
he
will
come
back
there
was
my
inmost
feeling
expressed
in
words
in
the
meantime
eyrecourt
was
satisfied
she
dashed
at
the
next
subject
as
fluent
and
as
confident
as
ever
now
winterfield
it
is
surely
plain
to
your
mind
that
you
must
not
see
stella
again
except
when
i
am
present
to
tie
the
tongue
of
scandal
my
daughter
s
conduct
must
not
allow
her
husband
if
you
only
knew
how
i
detest
that
man
must
not
i
say
allow
her
husband
the
slightest
excuse
for
keeping
away
from
her
if
we
give
that
odious
old
jesuit
the
chance
he
will
make
a
priest
of
romayne
before
we
know
where
we
are
the
audacity
of
these
papists
is
really
beyond
belief
you
remember
how
they
made
bishops
and
archbishops
here
in
flat
defiance
of
our
laws
father
benwell
follows
that
example
and
sets
our
other
laws
at
defiance
i
mean
our
marriage
laws
i
am
so
indignant
i
can
t
express
myself
as
clearly
as
usual
did
stella
tell
you
that
he
actually
shook
romayne
s
belief
in
his
own
marriage
ah
i
understand
she
kept
that
to
herself
poor
dear
and
with
good
reason
i
thought
of
the
page
in
the
letter
eyrecourt
readily
revealed
what
her
daughter
s
delicacy
had
forbidden
me
to
read
including
the
monstrous
assumption
which
connected
my
marriage
before
the
registrar
with
her
s
scruples
yes
she
proceeded
these
catholics
are
all
alike
my
daughter
i
don
t
mean
my
sweet
stella
i
mean
the
unnatural
creature
in
the
nunnery
sets
herself
above
her
own
mother
did
i
ever
tell
you
she
was
impudent
enough
to
say
she
would
pray
for
me
father
benwell
and
the
papal
aggression
over
again
now
tell
me
winterfield
don
t
you
think
taking
the
circumstances
into
consideration
that
you
will
act
like
a
thoroughly
sensible
man
if
you
go
back
to
devonshire
while
we
are
in
our
present
situation
what
with
in
the
carriage
and
newspapers
and
magazines
to
amuse
you
it
isn
t
such
a
very
long
journey
and
then
beaupark
dear
beaupark
is
such
a
remarkably
comfortable
house
in
the
winter
and
you
you
enviable
creature
are
such
a
popular
man
in
the
neighborhood
oh
go
back
go
back
i
got
up
and
took
my
hat
she
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
i
could
have
throttled
her
at
that
moment
and
yet
she
was
right
you
will
make
my
excuses
to
stella
i
said
you
dear
good
fellow
i
will
do
more
than
make
your
excuses
i
will
sing
your
praises
as
the
poet
in
her
ungovernable
exultation
at
having
got
rid
of
me
she
burst
into
extravagant
language
i
feel
like
a
mother
to
you
she
went
on
as
we
shook
hands
at
parting
i
declare
i
could
almost
let
you
kiss
there
was
not
a
single
kissable
place
about
eyrecourt
unpainted
undyed
or
unpowdered
i
resisted
temptation
and
opened
the
door
there
was
still
one
last
request
that
i
could
not
help
making
will
you
let
me
know
i
said
when
you
hear
from
rome
with
the
greatest
pleasure
eyrecourt
answered
briskly
you
best
of
friends
i
write
these
lines
while
the
servant
is
packing
my
portmanteau
traveler
knows
what
that
means
my
dog
is
glad
at
any
rate
to
get
away
from
london
i
think
i
shall
hire
a
yacht
and
try
what
a
voyage
round
the
world
will
do
for
me
i
wish
to
god
i
had
never
seen
stella
second
extract
beaupark
february
news
at
last
from
eyrecourt
romayne
has
not
even
read
the
letter
that
she
addressed
to
him
it
has
actually
been
returned
to
her
by
father
benwell
eyrecourt
writes
naturally
enough
in
a
state
of
fury
her
one
consolation
under
this
insulting
treatment
is
that
her
daughter
knows
nothing
of
the
circumstances
she
warns
me
quite
needlessly
to
keep
the
secret
and
sends
me
a
copy
of
father
benwell
s
letter
dear
madam
romayne
can
read
nothing
that
diverts
his
attention
from
his
preparation
for
the
priesthood
or
that
recalls
past
associations
with
errors
which
he
has
renounced
forever
when
a
letter
reaches
him
it
is
his
wise
custom
to
look
at
the
signature
first
he
has
handed
your
letter
to
me
with
a
request
that
i
will
return
it
to
you
in
his
presence
i
instantly
sealed
it
up
neither
he
nor
i
know
or
wish
to
know
on
what
subject
you
have
addressed
him
we
respectfully
advise
you
not
to
write
this
is
really
too
bad
but
it
has
one
advantage
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
it
sets
my
own
unworthy
doubts
and
jealousies
before
me
in
a
baser
light
than
ever
how
honestly
i
defended
father
benwell
and
how
completely
he
has
deceived
me
i
wonder
whether
i
shall
live
long
enough
to
see
the
jesuit
caught
in
one
of
his
own
traps
i
was
disappointed
at
not
hearing
from
stella
yesterday
this
morning
has
made
amends
it
has
brought
me
a
letter
from
her
she
is
not
well
and
her
mother
s
conduct
sadly
perplexes
her
at
one
time
eyrecourt
s
sense
of
injury
urges
her
to
indulge
in
violent
measures
she
is
eager
to
place
her
deserted
daughter
under
the
protection
of
the
law
to
insist
on
a
restitution
of
conjugal
rights
or
on
a
judicial
separation
at
another
time
she
sinks
into
a
state
of
abject
depression
declares
that
it
is
impossible
for
her
in
stella
s
deplorable
situation
to
face
society
and
recommends
immediate
retirement
to
some
place
on
the
continent
in
which
they
can
live
cheaply
this
latter
suggestion
stella
is
not
only
ready
but
eager
to
adopt
she
proves
it
by
asking
for
my
advice
in
a
postscript
no
doubt
remembering
the
happy
days
when
i
courted
her
in
paris
and
the
many
foreign
friends
of
mine
who
called
at
our
hotel
the
postscript
gave
me
the
excuse
that
i
wanted
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
it
would
be
better
for
me
not
to
see
her
and
i
went
to
london
for
the
sole
purpose
of
seeing
her
by
the
first
train
london
february
i
found
mother
and
daughter
together
in
the
it
was
one
of
eyrecourt
s
days
of
depression
her
little
twinkling
eyes
tried
to
cast
on
me
a
look
of
tragic
reproach
she
shook
her
dyed
head
and
said
oh
winterfield
i
didn
t
think
you
would
have
done
this
stella
fetch
me
my
smelling
but
stella
refused
to
take
the
hint
she
almost
brought
the
tears
into
my
eyes
she
received
me
so
kindly
if
her
mother
had
not
been
in
the
room
but
her
mother
in
the
room
i
had
no
other
choice
than
to
enter
on
my
business
as
if
i
had
been
the
family
lawyer
eyrecourt
began
by
reproving
stella
for
asking
my
advice
and
then
assured
me
that
she
had
no
intention
of
leaving
london
how
am
i
to
get
rid
of
my
house
she
asked
irritably
enough
i
knew
that
her
house
as
she
called
it
was
the
furnished
upper
part
of
a
house
belonging
to
another
person
and
that
she
could
leave
it
at
a
short
notice
but
i
said
nothing
i
addressed
myself
to
stella
i
have
been
thinking
of
two
or
three
places
which
you
might
like
i
went
on
the
nearest
place
belongs
to
an
old
french
gentleman
and
his
wife
they
have
no
children
and
they
don
t
let
lodgings
but
i
believe
they
would
be
glad
to
receive
friends
of
mine
if
their
spare
rooms
are
not
already
occupied
they
live
at
germain
close
to
i
looked
at
eyrecourt
as
i
said
those
last
words
i
was
as
sly
as
father
benwell
himself
paris
justified
my
confidence
the
temptation
was
too
much
for
her
she
not
only
gave
way
but
actually
mentioned
the
amount
of
rent
which
she
could
afford
to
pay
stella
whispered
her
thanks
to
me
as
i
went
out
my
name
is
not
mentioned
but
my
misfortune
is
alluded
to
in
the
newspapers
she
said
friends
are
calling
and
condoling
with
me
already
i
shall
die
if
you
don
t
help
me
to
get
away
among
strangers
i
start
for
paris
by
the
mail
train
paris
february
it
is
evening
i
have
just
returned
from
germain
everything
is
settled
with
more
slyness
on
my
part
i
begin
to
think
i
am
a
born
jesuit
there
must
have
been
some
detestable
sympathy
between
father
benwell
and
me
my
good
friends
monsieur
and
madame
villeray
will
be
only
too
glad
to
receive
english
ladies
known
to
me
for
many
years
the
spacious
and
handsome
first
floor
of
their
house
inherited
from
once
wealthy
ancestors
by
madame
villeray
can
be
got
ready
to
receive
eyrecourt
and
her
daughter
in
a
week
s
time
our
one
difficulty
related
to
the
question
of
money
monsieur
villeray
living
on
a
government
pension
was
modestly
unwilling
to
ask
terms
and
i
was
too
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
subject
to
be
of
the
slightest
assistance
to
him
it
ended
in
our
appealing
to
a
at
germain
his
estimate
appeared
to
me
to
be
quite
reasonable
but
it
exceeded
the
pecuniary
limit
mentioned
by
eyrecourt
i
had
known
the
villerays
long
enough
to
be
in
no
danger
of
offending
them
by
proposing
a
secret
arrangement
which
permitted
me
to
pay
the
difference
so
that
difficulty
was
got
over
in
due
course
of
time
we
went
into
the
large
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
there
i
committed
another
act
of
duplicity
in
a
nice
sheltered
corner
i
discovered
one
of
those
essentially
french
buildings
called
a
pavilion
a
delightful
little
toy
house
of
three
rooms
another
private
arrangement
made
me
the
tenant
of
this
place
madame
villeray
smiled
i
bet
you
she
said
to
me
in
her
very
best
english
one
of
these
ladies
is
in
her
fascinating
first
the
good
lady
little
knows
what
a
hopeless
love
affair
mine
is
i
must
see
stella
sometimes
i
ask
and
hope
for
no
more
never
have
i
felt
how
lonely
my
life
is
as
i
feel
it
now
third
extract
london
march
stella
and
her
mother
have
set
forth
on
their
journey
to
germain
this
morning
without
allowing
me
as
i
had
hoped
and
planned
to
be
their
escort
eyrecourt
set
up
the
old
objection
of
the
claims
of
propriety
if
that
were
the
only
obstacle
in
my
way
i
should
have
set
it
aside
by
following
them
to
france
where
is
the
impropriety
of
my
seeing
stella
as
her
friend
and
brother
especially
when
i
don
t
live
in
the
same
house
with
her
and
when
she
has
her
mother
on
one
side
and
madame
villeray
on
the
other
to
take
care
of
her
no
the
influence
that
keeps
me
away
from
germain
is
the
influence
of
stella
herself
i
will
write
to
you
often
she
said
but
i
beg
you
for
my
sake
not
to
accompany
us
to
her
look
and
tone
reduced
me
to
obedience
stupid
as
i
am
i
think
after
what
passed
between
me
and
her
mother
i
can
guess
what
she
meant
am
i
never
to
see
you
again
i
asked
do
you
think
i
am
hard
and
ungrateful
she
answered
do
you
doubt
that
i
shall
be
glad
more
than
glad
to
see
you
when
she
turned
away
from
me
and
said
no
more
it
was
time
to
take
leave
we
were
under
her
mother
s
superintendence
we
shook
hands
and
that
was
all
matilda
eyrecourt
s
maid
followed
me
downstairs
to
open
the
door
i
suppose
i
looked
as
i
felt
wretchedly
enough
the
good
creature
tried
to
cheer
me
don
t
be
anxious
about
them
she
said
i
am
used
to
traveling
sir
and
i
ll
take
care
of
she
is
a
woman
to
be
thoroughly
depended
on
a
faithful
and
attached
servant
i
made
her
a
little
present
at
parting
and
i
asked
her
if
she
would
write
to
me
from
time
to
time
some
people
might
consider
this
to
be
rather
an
undignified
proceeding
on
my
part
i
can
only
say
it
came
naturally
to
me
i
am
not
a
dignified
man
and
when
a
person
means
kindly
toward
me
i
don
t
ask
myself
whether
that
person
is
higher
or
lower
richer
or
poorer
than
i
am
we
are
to
my
mind
on
the
same
level
when
the
same
sympathy
unites
us
matilda
was
sufficiently
acquainted
with
all
that
had
passed
to
foresee
as

pleasure
in
the
society

their
country
neighbors

am
a
miserable
creature

a
mind

state
of
incessant
disturbance
excellent
fathers
of
families

me
exemplary

in
the

we
have
just
passed
the
eddystone
lighthouse
with
the
wind
abeam
the
log
registers
ten
knots
an
hour
fourth
extract
the
fair
promise
at
the
beginning
of
my
voyage
has
not
been
fulfilled
owing
to
contrary
winds
storms
and
delays
at
cadiz
in
repairing
damages
we
have
only
arrived
at
naples
this
evening
under
trying
circumstances
of
all
sorts
the
yacht
has
behaved
admirably
a
stouter
and
finer
never
was
built
we
are
too
late
to
find
the
open
i
shall
send
ashore
for
letters
the
first
thing
tomorrow
morning
my
next
movements
will
depend
entirely
on
the
news
i
get
from
germain
if
i
remain
for
any
length
of
time
in
these
regions
i
shall
give
my
crew
the
holiday
they
have
well
earned
at
civita
vecchia
i
am
never
weary
of
rome
but
i
always
did
and
always
shall
dislike
naples
may
my
plans
are
completely
changed
i
am
annoyed
and
angry
the
further
i
get
away
from
france
the
better
i
shall
be
pleased
i
have
heard
from
stella
and
heard
from
the
maid
both
letters
inform
me
that
the
child
is
born
and
that
it
is
a
boy
do
they
expect
me
to
feel
any
interest
in
the
boy
he
is
my
worst
enemy
before
he
is
out
of
his
stella
writes
kindly
enough
not
a
line
in
her
letter
however
invites
me
or
holds
out
the
prospect
of
inviting
me
to
germain
she
refers
to
her
mother
very
briefly
merely
informing
me
that
eyrecourt
is
well
and
is
already
enjoying
the
gayeties
of
paris
of
the
letter
are
occupied
with
the
baby
when
i
wrote
to
her
i
signed
myself
yours
stella
signs
yours
it
is
a
trifle
i
daresay
but
i
feel
it
for
all
that
matilda
is
faithful
to
her
engagement
matilda
s
letter
tells
me
the
truth
since
the
birth
of
the
baby
she
writes
mrs
romayne
has
never
once
mentioned
your
name
she
can
talk
of
nothing
and
think
of
nothing
but
her
child
i
make
every
allowance
i
hope
for
a
lady
in
her
melancholy
situation
but
i
do
think
it
is
not
very
grateful
to
have
quite
forgotten
winterfield
who
has
done
so
much
for
her
and
who
only
asks
to
pass
a
few
hours
of
his
day
innocently
in
her
society
perhaps
being
a
single
woman
i
write
ignorantly
about
mothers
and
babies
but
i
have
my
feelings
and
though
i
never
liked
romayne
i
feel
for
sir
if
you
will
forgive
the
familiarity
in
my
opinion
this
new
craze
about
the
baby
will
wear
out
he
is
already
a
cause
of
difference
of
opinion
my
good
mistress
who
possesses
knowledge
of
the
world
and
a
kind
heart
as
well
advises
that
romayne
should
be
informed
of
the
birth
of
a
son
and
heir
eyrecourt
says
most
truly
that
the
hateful
old
priest
will
get
possession
of
romayne
s
property
to
the
prejudice
of
the
child
unless
steps
are
taken
to
shame
him
into
doing
justice
to
his
own
son
but
romayne
is
as
proud
as
lucifer
she
will
not
hear
of
making
the
first
advances
as
she
calls
it
the
man
who
has
deserted
me
she
says
has
no
heart
to
be
touched
either
by
wife
or
my
mistress
does
not
agree
with
her
there
have
been
hard
words
already
and
the
nice
old
french
gentleman
and
his
wife
try
to
make
peace
you
will
smile
when
i
tell
you
that
they
offer
as
a
sort
of
composing
gift
my
mistress
accepts
the
gift
and
has
been
to
the
theater
at
paris
with
monsieur
and
madame
villeray
more
than
once
already
to
conclude
sir
if
i
might
venture
to
advise
you
i
should
recommend
trying
the
effect
on
of
absence
and
a
most
sensibly
written
letter
i
shall
certainly
take
matilda
s
advice
my
name
is
never
mentioned
by
stella
and
not
a
day
has
passed
without
my
thinking
of
her
well
i
suppose
a
man
can
harden
his
heart
if
he
likes
let
me
harden
heart
and
forget
her
the
crew
shall
have
three
days
ashore
at
naples
and
then
we
sail
for
alexandria
in
that
port
the
yacht
will
wait
my
return
i
have
not
yet
visited
the
cataracts
of
the
nile
i
have
not
yet
seen
the
magnificent
women
of
nubia
a
tent
in
the
desert
and
a
dusky
daughter
of
nature
to
keep
house
for
me
there
is
a
new
life
for
a
man
who
is
weary
of
the
vapid
civilization
of
europe
i
shall
begin
by
letting
my
beard
grow
fifth
extract
civita
vecchia
february
back
again
on
the
coast
of
italy
after
an
absence
at
sea
and
ashore
of
nine
months
what
have
my
travels
done
for
me
they
have
made
me
browner
and
thinner
they
have
given
me
a
more
patient
mind
and
a
taste
for
mild
tobacco
have
they
helped
me
to
forget
stella
not
the
least
in
the
world
i
am
more
eager
than
ever
to
see
her
again
when
i
look
back
at
my
diary
i
am
really
ashamed
of
my
own
fretfulness
and
impatience
what
miserable
vanity
on
my
part
to
expect
her
to
think
of
me
when
she
was
absorbed
in
the
first
cares
and
joys
of
maternity
especially
sacred
to
her
poor
soul
as
the
one
consolation
of
her
melancholy
life
i
withdraw
all
that
i
wrote
about
her
and
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
forgive
the
baby
rome
march
i
have
found
my
letters
waiting
for
me
at
the
office
of
my
banker
the
latest
news
from
germain
is
all
that
i
could
wish
in
acknowledging
the
receipt
of
my
last
letter
from
cairo
i
broke
my
rash
vow
of
silence
when
we
got
into
port
after
leaving
naples
stella
sends
me
the
long
desired
invitation
pray
take
care
to
return
to
us
dear
bernard
before
the
first
anniversary
of
my
boy
s
birthday
on
the
of
after
those
words
she
need
feel
no
apprehension
of
my
being
late
at
my
appointment
traveler
the
dog
has
well
merited
his
name
by
this
time
will
have
to
bid
to
the
yacht
which
he
loves
and
journey
homeward
by
the
railway
which
he
hates
no
more
risk
of
storms
and
delays
for
me
to
the
sea
for
one
while
i
have
sent
the
news
of
my
safe
return
from
the
east
by
telegraph
but
i
must
not
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
leave
rome
or
i
shall
commit
a
serious
error
i
shall
disappoint
stella
s
mother
eyrecourt
writes
to
me
earnestly
requesting
if
i
return
by
way
of
italy
that
i
will
get
her
some
information
about
romayne
she
is
eager
to
know
whether
they
have
made
him
a
priest
yet
i
am
also
to
discover
if
i
can
what
are
his
prospects
whether
he
is
as
miserable
as
he
deserves
to
be
whether
he
has
been
disappointed
in
his
expectations
and
is
likely
to
be
brought
back
to
his
senses
in
that
way
and
above
all
whether
father
benwell
is
still
at
rome
with
him
my
idea
is
that
eyrecourt
has
not
given
up
her
design
of
making
romayne
acquainted
with
the
birth
of
his
son
the
right
person
to
apply
to
for
information
is
evidently
my
banker
he
has
been
a
resident
in
rome
for
twenty
years
but
he
is
too
busy
a
man
to
be
approached
by
an
idler
like
myself
in
business
hours
i
have
asked
him
to
dine
with
me
march
my
guest
has
just
left
me
i
am
afraid
eyrecourt
will
be
sadly
disappointed
when
she
hears
what
i
have
to
tell
her
the
moment
i
mentioned
romayne
s
name
the
banker
looked
at
me
with
an
expression
of
surprise
the
man
most
talked
about
in
rome
he
said
i
wonder
you
have
not
heard
of
him
is
he
a
priest
certainly
and
what
is
more
the
ordinary
preparations
for
the
priesthood
were
expressly
shortened
by
high
authority
on
his
account
the
pope
takes
the
greatest
interest
in
him
and
as
for
the
people
the
italians
have
already
nicknamed
him
the
young
don
t
suppose
as
some
of
our
countrymen
do
that
he
is
indebted
to
his
wealth
for
the
high
position
which
he
has
already
attained
his
wealth
is
only
one
of
the
minor
influences
in
his
favor
the
truth
is
he
unites
in
himself
two
opposite
qualities
both
of
the
greatest
value
to
the
church
which
are
very
rarely
found
combined
in
the
same
man
he
has
already
made
a
popular
reputation
here
as
a
most
eloquent
and
convincing
preacher
a
preacher
i
exclaimed
and
a
popular
reputation
how
do
the
italians
understand
him
the
banker
looked
puzzled
why
shouldn
t
they
understand
a
man
who
addresses
them
in
their
own
language
he
said
romayne
could
speak
italian
when
he
came
here
and
since
that
time
he
has
learned
by
constant
practice
to
think
in
italian
while
our
roman
season
lasts
he
preaches
alternately
in
italian
and
in
english
but
i
was
speaking
of
the
two
opposite
accomplishments
which
this
remarkable
man
possesses
out
of
the
pulpit
he
is
capable
of
applying
his
mind
successfully
to
the
political
necessities
of
the
church
as
i
am
told
his
intellect
has
had
severe
practical
training
by
means
of
historical
studies
in
the
past
years
of
his
life
anyhow
in
one
of
the
diplomatic
difficulties
here
between
the
church
and
the
state
he
wrote
a
memorial
on
the
subject
which
the
declared
to
be
a
model
of
ability
in
applying
the
experience
of
the
past
to
the
need
of
the
present
time
if
he
doesn
t
wear
himself
out
his
italian
nickname
may
prove
prophetically
true
we
may
live
to
see
the
new
convert
cardinal
are
you
acquainted
with
him
yourself
i
asked
no
englishman
is
acquainted
with
him
the
banker
answered
there
is
a
report
of
some
romantic
event
in
his
life
which
has
led
to
his
leaving
england
and
which
makes
him
recoil
from
intercourse
with
his
own
nation
whether
this
is
true
or
false
it
is
certain
that
the
english
in
rome
find
him
unapproachable
i
have
even
heard
that
he
refuses
to
receive
letters
from
england
if
you
wish
to
see
him
you
must
do
what
i
have
done
you
must
go
to
church
and
look
at
him
in
the
pulpit
he
preaches
in
english
i
think
for
the
last
time
this
season
on
thursday
evening
next
shall
i
call
here
and
take
you
to
the
church
if
i
had
followed
my
inclinations
i
should
have
refused
i
feel
no
sort
of
interest
in
romayne
i
might
even
say
i
feel
a
downright
antipathy
toward
him
but
i
have
no
wish
to
appear
insensible
to
the
banker
s
kindness
and
my
reception
at
germain
depends
greatly
on
the
attention
i
show
to
eyrecourt
s
request
so
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
hear
the
great
preacher
with
a
mental
reservation
on
my
part
which
contemplated
my
departure
from
the
church
before
the
end
of
his
sermon
but
before
i
see
him
i
feel
assured
of
one
thing
especially
after
what
the
banker
has
told
me
stella
s
view
of
his
character
is
the
right
one
the
man
who
has
deserted
her
has
no
heart
to
be
touched
by
wife
or
child
they
are
separated
forever
march
i
have
just
seen
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
he
can
help
me
to
answer
one
of
eyrecourt
s
questions
a
nephew
of
his
holds
some
employment
at
the
jesuit
headquarters
here
adjoining
their
famous
church
i
have
requested
the
young
man
to
ascertain
if
father
benwell
is
still
in
rome
without
mentioning
me
it
would
be
no
small
trial
to
my
if
we
met
in
the
street
march
good
news
this
time
for
eyrecourt
as
far
as
it
goes
father
benwell
has
long
since
left
rome
and
has
returned
to
his
regular
duties
in
england
if
he
exercises
any
further
influence
over
romayne
it
must
be
done
by
letter
march
i
have
returned
from
romayne
s
sermon
this
double
renegade
has
he
not
deserted
his
religion
and
his
wife
has
failed
to
convince
my
reason
but
he
has
so
completely
upset
my
nerves
that
i
ordered
a
bottle
of
champagne
to
the
great
amusement
of
my
friend
the
banker
the
moment
we
got
back
to
the
hotel
we
drove
through
the
scantily
lighted
streets
of
rome
to
a
small
church
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
piazza
navona
to
a
more
imaginative
man
than
myself
the
scene
when
we
entered
the
building
would
have
been
too
impressive
to
be
described
in
words
though
it
might
perhaps
have
been
painted
the
one
light
in
the
place
glimmered
mysteriously
from
a
great
wax
candle
burning
in
front
of
a
drapery
of
black
cloth
and
illuminating
dimly
a
sculptured
representation
in
white
marble
of
the
crucified
christ
wrought
to
the
size
of
life
in
front
of
this
ghastly
emblem
a
platform
projected
also
covered
with
black
cloth
we
could
penetrate
no
further
than
to
the
space
just
inside
the
door
of
the
church
everywhere
else
the
building
was
filled
with
standing
sitting
and
kneeling
figures
shadowy
and
mysterious
fading
away
in
far
corners
into
impenetrable
gloom
the
only
sounds
were
the
low
wailing
notes
of
the
organ
accompanied
at
intervals
by
the
muffled
thump
of
fanatic
worshipers
penitentially
beating
their
breasts
on
a
sudden
the
organ
ceased
the
blows
of
the
penitents
were
heard
no
more
in
the
breathless
silence
that
followed
a
man
robed
in
black
mounted
the
black
platform
and
faced
the
congregation
his
hair
had
become
prematurely
gray
his
face
was
of
the
ghastly
paleness
of
the
great
crucifix
at
his
side
the
light
of
the
candle
falling
on
him
as
he
slowly
turned
his
head
cast
shadows
into
the
hollows
of
his
cheeks
and
glittered
in
his
gleaming
eyes
in
tones
low
and
trembling
at
first
he
stated
the
subject
of
his
address
a
week
since
two
noteworthy
persons
had
died
in
rome
on
the
same
day
one
of
them
was
a
woman
of
exemplary
piety
whose
funeral
obsequies
had
been
celebrated
in
that
church
the
other
was
a
criminal
charged
with
homicide
under
provocation
who
had
died
in
prison
refusing
the
services
of
the
priest
impenitent
to
the
last
the
sermon
followed
the
spirit
of
the
absolved
woman
to
its
eternal
reward
in
heaven
and
described
the
meeting
with
dear
ones
who
had
gone
before
in
terms
so
devout
and
so
touching
that
the
women
near
us
and
even
some
of
the
men
burst
into
tears
far
different
was
the
effect
produced
when
the
preacher
filled
with
the
same
overpowering
sincerity
of
belief
which
had
inspired
his
description
of
the
joys
of
heaven
traced
the
downward
progress
of
the
lost
man
from
his
impenitent
to
his
doom
in
hell
the
dreadful
superstition
of
everlasting
torment
became
doubly
dreadful
in
the
priest
s
fervent
words
he
described
the
retributive
voices
of
the
mother
and
the
brother
of
the
murdered
man
ringing
incessantly
in
the
ears
of
the
homicide
i
who
speak
to
you
hear
the
voices
he
cried
assassin
assassin
where
are
you
i
see
him
i
see
the
assassin
hurled
into
his
place
in
the
sleepless
ranks
of
the
damned
i
see
him
dripping
with
the
flames
that
burn
forever
writhing
under
the
torments
that
are
without
respite
and
without
the
climax
of
this
terrible
effort
of
imagination
was
reached
when
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
prayed
with
sobs
and
cries
of
entreaty
prayed
pointing
to
the
crucifix
at
his
side
that
he
and
all
who
heard
him
might
die
the
death
of
penitent
sinners
absolved
in
the
divinely
atoning
name
of
christ
the
hysterical
shrieks
of
women
rang
through
the
church
i
could
endure
it
no
longer
i
hurried
into
the
street
and
breathed
again
freely
when
i
looked
up
at
the
cloudless
beauty
of
the
night
sky
bright
with
the
peaceful
radiance
of
the
stars
and
this
man
was
romayne
i
had
last
met
with
him
among
his
delightful
works
of
art
an
enthusiast
in
literature
the
hospitable
master
of
a
house
filled
with
comforts
and
luxuries
to
its
remotest
corner
and
now
i
had
seen
what
rome
had
made
of
him
yes
said
my
companion
the
ancient
church
not
only
finds
out
the
men
who
can
best
serve
it
but
develops
qualities
in
those
men
of
which
they
have
been
themselves
unconscious
the
advance
which
roman
catholic
christianity
has
been
and
is
still
making
has
its
intelligible
reason
thanks
to
the
great
reformation
the
papal
scandals
of
past
centuries
have
been
atoned
for
by
the
exemplary
lives
of
servants
of
the
church
in
high
places
and
low
places
alike
if
a
new
luther
arose
among
us
where
would
he
now
find
abuses
sufficiently
wicked
and
widely
spread
to
shock
the
sense
of
decency
in
christendom
he
would
find
them
nowhere
and
he
would
probably
return
to
the
respectable
shelter
of
the
roman
i
listened
without
making
any
remark
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
thinking
of
stella
march
i
have
been
to
civita
vecchia
to
give
a
little
farewell
entertainment
to
the
officers
and
crew
before
they
take
the
yacht
back
to
england
in
a
few
words
i
said
at
parting
i
mentioned
that
it
was
my
purpose
to
make
an
offer
for
the
purchase
of
the
vessel
and
that
my
guests
should
hear
from
me
again
on
the
subject
this
announcement
was
received
with
enthusiasm
i
really
like
my
crew
and
i
don
t
think
it
is
vain
in
me
to
believe
that
they
return
the
feeling
from
the
to
the
my
future
life
after
all
that
has
passed
is
likely
to
be
a
roving
life
unless
no
i
may
think
sometimes
of
that
happier
prospect
but
i
had
better
not
put
my
thoughts
into
words
i
have
a
fine
vessel
i
have
plenty
of
money
and
i
like
the
sea
there
are
three
good
reasons
for
buying
the
yacht
returning
to
rome
in
the
evening
i
found
waiting
for
me
a
letter
from
stella
she
writes
immediately
on
the
receipt
of
my
telegram
to
make
a
similar
request
to
the
request
addressed
to
me
by
her
mother
now
that
i
am
at
rome
she
too
wants
to
hear
news
of
a
jesuit
priest
he
is
absent
on
a
foreign
mission
and
his
name
is
penrose
you
shall
hear
what
obligations
i
owe
to
his
kindness
she
writes
when
we
meet
in
the
meantime
i
will
only
say
that
he
is
the
exact
opposite
of
father
benwell
and
that
i
should
be
the
most
ungrateful
of
women
if
i
did
not
feel
the
truest
interest
in
his
this
is
strange
and
to
my
mind
not
satisfactory
who
is
penrose
and
what
has
he
done
to
deserve
such
strong
expressions
of
gratitude
if
anybody
had
told
me
that
stella
could
make
a
friend
of
a
jesuit
i
am
afraid
i
should
have
returned
a
rude
answer
well
i
must
wait
for
further
enlightenment
and
apply
to
the
landlord
s
nephew
once
more
march
there
is
small
prospect
i
fear
of
my
being
able
to
appreciate
the
merits
of
penrose
by
personal
experience
he
is
thousands
of
miles
away
from
europe
and
he
is
in
a
situation
of
peril
which
makes
the
chance
of
his
safe
return
doubtful
in
the
last
degree
the
mission
to
which
he
is
attached
was
originally
destined
to
find
its
field
of
work
in
central
america
rumors
of
more
fighting
to
come
in
that
revolutionary
part
of
the
world
reached
rome
before
the
missionaries
had
sailed
from
the
port
of
leghorn
under
these
discouraging
circumstances
the
priestly
authorities
changed
the
destination
of
the
mission
to
the
territory
of
arizona
bordering
on
new
mexico
and
recently
purchased
by
the
united
states
here
in
the
valley
of
santa
cruz
the
jesuits
had
first
attempted
the
conversion
of
the
indian
tribes
two
hundred
years
since
and
had
failed
their
and
chapel
are
now
a
heap
of
ruins
and
the
ferocious
apache
indians
keep
the
fertile
valley
a
solitude
by
the
mere
terror
of
their
name
to
this
place
penrose
and
his
companions
have
made
their
daring
pilgrimage
and
they
are
now
risking
their
lives
in
the
attempt
to
open
the
hearts
of
these
bloodthirsty
savages
to
the
influence
of
christianity
nothing
has
been
yet
heard
of
them
at
the
best
no
trustworthy
news
is
expected
for
months
to
come
what
will
stella
say
to
this
anyhow
i
begin
to
understand
her
interest
in
penrose
now
he
is
one
of
a
company
of
heroes
i
am
already
anxious
to
hear
more
of
him
will
be
a
memorable
day
in
my
calendar
i
leave
rome
for
germain
if
any
further
information
is
to
be
gained
for
eyrecourt
and
her
daughter
i
have
made
the
necessary
arrangements
for
receiving
it
the
banker
has
promised
to
write
to
me
if
there
is
a
change
in
romayne
s
life
and
prospects
and
my
landlord
will
take
care
that
i
hear
of
it
in
the
event
of
news
reaching
rome
from
the
mission
at
arizona
sixth
extract
germain
march
i
arrived
yesterday
between
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
and
the
pleasurable
agitation
caused
by
seeing
stella
again
i
was
unfit
to
make
the
customary
entry
in
my
diary
when
i
retired
for
the
night
she
is
more
irresistibly
beautiful
than
ever
her
figure
a
little
too
slender
as
i
remember
it
has
filled
out
her
lovely
face
has
lost
its
haggard
careworn
look
her
complexion
has
recovered
its
delicacy
i
see
again
in
her
eyes
the
pure
serenity
of
expression
which
first
fascinated
me
years
since
it
may
be
due
to
the
consoling
influence
of
the
child
assisted
perhaps
by
the
lapse
of
time
and
the
peaceful
life
which
she
now
leads
but
this
at
least
is
certain
such
a
change
for
the
better
i
never
could
have
imagined
as
the
change
i
find
in
stella
after
a
year
s
absence
as
for
the
baby
he
is
a
bright
little
fellow
and
he
has
one
great
merit
in
my
estimation
he
bears
no
resemblance
to
his
father
i
saw
his
mother
s
features
when
i
first
took
him
on
my
knee
and
looked
at
his
face
lifted
to
mine
in
grave
surprise
the
baby
and
i
are
certain
to
get
on
well
together
even
eyrecourt
seems
to
have
improved
in
the
french
air
and
under
the
french
diet
she
has
a
better
surface
to
lay
the
paint
on
her
nimble
tongue
runs
faster
than
ever
and
she
has
so
completely
recovered
her
good
spirits
that
monsieur
and
madame
villeray
declare
she
must
have
french
blood
in
her
veins
they
were
all
so
unaffectedly
glad
to
see
me
matilda
included
that
it
was
really
like
returning
to
one
s
home
as
for
traveler
i
must
interfere
in
the
interests
of
his
figure
and
his
health
to
prevent
everybody
in
the
house
from
feeding
him
with
every
eatable
thing
from
plain
bread
to
de
foie
my
experience
of
will
as
stella
tells
me
be
my
general
experience
of
the
family
life
at
germain
we
begin
the
morning
with
the
customary
cup
of
coffee
at
eleven
o
clock
i
am
summoned
from
my
pavilion
of
three
rooms
to
one
of
those
delicious
and
artfully
varied
breakfasts
which
are
only
to
be
found
in
france
and
in
scotland
an
interval
of
about
three
hours
follows
during
which
the
child
takes
his
airing
and
his
siesta
and
his
elders
occupy
themselves
as
they
please
at
three
o
clock
we
all
go
out
with
a
pony
chaise
which
carries
the
weaker
members
of
the
household
for
a
ramble
in
the
forest
at
six
o
clock
we
assemble
at
the
at
coffee
time
some
of
the
neighbors
drop
in
for
a
game
at
cards
at
ten
we
all
wish
each
other
such
is
the
domestic
programme
varied
by
excursions
in
the
country
and
by
occasional
visits
to
paris
i
am
naturally
a
man
of
quiet
habits
it
is
only
when
my
mind
is
disturbed
that
i
get
restless
and
feel
longings
for
change
surely
the
quiet
routine
at
germain
ought
to
be
welcome
to
me
now
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
this
life
through
a
long
year
of
travel
what
more
can
i
wish
for
nothing
more
of
course
and
yet
and
yet
stella
has
innocently
made
it
harder
than
ever
to
play
the
part
of
her
the
recovery
of
her
beauty
is
a
subject
for
congratulation
to
her
mother
and
her
friends
how
does
it
affect
me
i
had
better
not
think
of
my
hard
fate
can
i
help
thinking
of
it
can
i
dismiss
from
memory
the
unmerited
misfortunes
which
have
taken
from
me
in
the
prime
of
her
charms
the
woman
whom
i
love
at
least
i
can
try
the
good
old
moral
must
be
moral
be
content
with
such
things
as
ye
march
it
is
eight
in
the
morning
and
i
hardly
know
how
to
employ
myself
having
finished
my
coffee
i
have
just
looked
again
at
my
diary
it
strikes
me
that
i
am
falling
into
a
bad
habit
of
writing
too
much
about
myself
the
custom
of
keeping
a
journal
certainly
has
this
drawback
it
encourages
egotism
well
the
remedy
is
easy
from
this
date
i
lock
up
my
book
only
to
open
it
again
when
some
event
has
happened
which
has
a
claim
to
be
recorded
for
its
own
sake
as
for
myself
and
my
feelings
they
have
made
their
last
appearance
in
these
pages
seventh
extract
june
the
occasion
for
opening
my
diary
once
more
has
presented
itself
this
morning
news
has
reached
me
of
romayne
which
is
too
important
to
be
passed
over
without
notice
he
has
been
appointed
one
of
the
pope
s
chamberlains
it
is
also
reported
on
good
authority
that
he
will
be
attached
to
a
papal
embassy
when
a
vacancy
occurs
these
honors
present
and
to
come
seem
to
remove
him
further
than
ever
from
the
possibility
of
a
return
to
his
wife
and
child
june
in
regard
to
romayne
eyrecourt
seems
to
be
of
my
opinion
being
in
paris
at
a
morning
concert
she
there
met
with
her
old
friend
doctor
wybrow
the
famous
physician
is
suffering
from
overwork
and
is
on
his
way
to
italy
for
a
few
months
of
rest
and
recreation
they
took
a
drive
together
after
the
performance
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
eyrecourt
opened
her
mind
to
the
doctor
as
freely
as
usual
on
the
subject
of
stella
and
the
child
he
entirely
agreed
speaking
in
the
future
interests
of
the
boy
that
precious
time
has
been
lost
in
informing
romayne
of
the
birth
of
an
heir
and
he
has
promised
no
matter
what
obstacles
may
be
placed
in
his
way
to
make
the
announcement
himself
when
he
reaches
rome
june
madame
villeray
has
been
speaking
to
me
confidentially
on
a
very
delicate
subject
i
am
pledged
to
discontinue
writing
about
myself
but
in
these
private
pages
i
may
note
the
substance
of
what
my
good
friend
said
to
me
if
i
only
look
back
often
enough
at
this
little
record
i
may
gather
the
resolution
to
profit
by
her
advice
in
brief
these
were
her
words
stella
has
spoken
to
me
in
confidence
since
she
met
you
accidentally
in
the
garden
yesterday
she
can
not
be
guilty
of
the
poor
affectation
of
concealing
what
you
must
have
already
discovered
for
yourself
but
she
prefers
to
say
the
words
that
must
be
said
to
you
through
me
her
husband
s
conduct
to
her
is
an
outrage
that
she
can
never
forget
she
now
looks
back
with
sentiments
of
repulsion
which
she
dare
not
describe
to
that
love
at
first
sight
as
you
call
it
in
england
conceived
on
the
day
when
they
first
met
and
she
remembers
regretfully
that
other
love
of
years
since
which
was
love
of
steadier
and
slower
growth
to
her
shame
she
confesses
that
she
failed
to
set
you
the
example
of
duty
and
when
you
two
happened
to
be
alone
yesterday
she
leaves
it
to
my
discretion
to
tell
you
that
you
must
see
her
for
the
future
always
in
the
presence
of
some
other
person
make
no
reference
to
this
when
you
next
meet
and
understand
that
she
has
only
spoken
to
me
instead
of
to
her
mother
because
she
fears
that
eyrecourt
might
use
harsh
words
and
distress
you
again
as
she
once
distressed
you
in
england
if
you
will
take
my
advice
you
will
ask
permission
to
go
away
again
on
your
it
matters
nothing
what
i
said
in
reply
let
me
only
relate
that
we
were
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
the
nursemaid
at
the
pavilion
door
she
led
the
child
by
the
hand
among
his
first
efforts
at
speaking
under
his
mother
s
instruction
had
been
the
effort
to
call
me
uncle
bernard
he
had
now
got
as
far
as
the
first
syllable
of
my
christian
name
and
he
had
come
to
me
to
repeat
his
lesson
resting
his
little
hands
on
my
knees
he
looked
up
at
me
with
his
mother
s
eyes
and
said
uncle
ber
a
trifling
incident
but
at
that
moment
it
cut
me
to
the
heart
i
could
only
take
the
boy
in
my
arms
and
look
at
madame
villeray
the
good
woman
felt
for
me
i
saw
tears
in
her
eyes
no
no
more
writing
about
myself
i
close
the
book
again
eighth
extract
july
a
letter
has
reached
eyrecourt
this
morning
from
doctor
wybrow
it
is
dated
castel
gandolpho
near
here
the
doctor
is
established
during
the
hot
months
and
here
he
has
seen
romayne
in
attendance
on
the
holy
father
in
the
famous
summer
palace
of
the
popes
how
he
obtained
the
interview
eyrecourt
is
not
informed
to
a
man
of
his
celebrity
doors
are
no
doubt
opened
which
remain
closed
to
persons
less
widely
known
i
have
performed
my
promise
he
writes
and
i
may
say
for
myself
that
i
spoke
with
every
needful
precaution
the
result
a
little
startled
me
romayne
was
not
merely
unprepared
to
hear
of
the
birth
of
his
child
he
was
physically
and
morally
incapable
of
sustaining
the
shock
of
the
disclosure
for
the
moment
i
thought
he
had
been
seized
with
a
fit
of
catalepsy
he
moved
however
when
i
tried
to
take
his
hand
to
feel
the
pulse
shrinking
back
in
his
chair
and
feebly
signing
to
me
to
leave
him
i
committed
him
to
the
care
of
his
servant
the
next
day
i
received
a
letter
from
one
of
his
priestly
colleagues
informing
me
that
he
was
slowly
recovering
after
the
shock
that
i
had
inflicted
and
requesting
me
to
hold
no
further
communication
with
him
either
personally
or
by
letter
i
wish
i
could
have
sent
you
a
more
favorable
report
of
my
interference
in
this
painful
matter
perhaps
you
or
your
daughter
may
hear
from
july
no
letter
has
been
received
eyrecourt
is
uneasy
stella
on
the
contrary
seems
to
be
relieved
july
a
letter
has
arrived
from
london
addressed
to
stella
by
romayne
s
english
lawyers
the
income
which
romayne
has
refused
for
herself
is
to
be
legally
settled
on
her
child
technical
particulars
follow
which
it
is
needless
to
repeat
here
by
return
of
post
stella
has
answered
the
lawyers
declaring
that
so
long
as
she
lives
and
has
any
influence
over
her
son
he
shall
not
touch
the
offered
income
eyrecourt
monsieur
and
madame
villeray
and
even
matilda
entreated
her
not
to
send
the
letter
to
my
thinking
stella
acted
with
becoming
spirit
though
there
is
no
entail
still
vange
abbey
is
morally
the
boy
s
birthright
it
is
a
cruel
wrong
to
offer
him
anything
else
july
for
the
second
time
i
have
proposed
to
leave
germain
the
presence
of
the
third
person
whenever
i
am
in
her
company
is
becoming
unendurable
to
me
she
still
uses
her
influence
to
defer
my
departure
nobody
sympathizes
with
me
she
said
but
i
am
failing
to
keep
my
promise
to
myself
not
to
write
about
myself
but
there
is
some
little
excuse
this
time
for
the
relief
of
my
own
conscience
i
may
surely
place
it
on
record
that
i
have
tried
to
do
what
is
right
it
is
not
my
fault
if
i
remain
at
germain
insensible
to
madame
villeray
s
warning
ninth
extract
september
terrible
news
from
rome
of
the
jesuit
mission
to
arizona
the
indians
have
made
a
night
attack
on
the
new
the
building
is
burned
to
the
ground
and
the
missionaries
have
been
massacred
with
the
exception
of
two
priests
carried
away
captive
the
names
of
the
priests
are
not
known
news
of
the
atrocity
has
been
delayed
four
months
on
its
way
to
europe
owing
partly
to
the
civil
war
in
the
united
states
and
partly
to
disturbances
in
central
america
looking
at
the
which
we
receive
regularly
at
germain
i
found
this
statement
confirmed
in
a
short
paragraph
but
here
also
the
names
of
the
two
prisoners
failed
to
appear
our
one
present
hope
of
getting
any
further
information
seems
to
me
to
depend
on
our
english
newspaper
the
stands
alone
as
the
one
public
journal
which
has
the
whole
english
nation
for
volunteer
contributors
in
their
troubles
at
home
they
appeal
to
the
editor
in
their
travels
abroad
over
civilized
and
savage
regions
alike
if
they
meet
with
an
adventure
worth
mentioning
they
tell
it
to
the
editor
if
any
one
of
our
countrymen
knows
anything
of
this
dreadful
massacre
i
foresee
with
certainty
where
we
shall
find
the
information
in
print
soon
after
my
arrival
here
stella
had
told
me
of
her
memorable
conversation
with
penrose
in
the
garden
at
ten
acres
lodge
i
was
well
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
her
obligation
to
the
young
priest
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
outbreak
of
grief
which
escaped
her
when
she
had
read
the
telegram
from
rome
she
actually
went
the
length
of
saying
i
shall
never
enjoy
another
happy
moment
till
i
know
whether
penrose
is
one
of
the
two
living
priests
the
inevitable
third
person
with
us
this
morning
was
monsieur
villeray
sitting
at
the
window
with
a
book
in
his
hand
sometimes
reading
sometimes
looking
at
the
garden
with
the
eye
of
a
fond
horticulturist
he
discovered
a
strange
cat
among
his
flower
beds
forgetful
of
every
other
consideration
the
old
gentleman
hobbled
out
to
drive
away
the
intruder
and
left
us
together
i
spoke
to
stella
in
words
which
i
would
now
give
everything
i
possess
to
recall
a
detestable
jealousy
took
possession
of
me
i
meanly
hinted
that
penrose
could
claim
no
great
merit
in
the
matter
of
romayne
s
conversion
for
yielding
to
the
entreaties
of
a
beautiful
woman
who
had
fascinated
him
though
he
might
be
afraid
to
own
it
she
protested
against
my
unworthy
insinuation
but
she
failed
to
make
me
ashamed
of
myself
is
a
woman
ever
ignorant
of
the
influence
which
her
beauty
exercises
over
a
man
i
went
on
like
the
miserable
creature
that
i
was
from
bad
to
worse
excuse
me
i
said
if
i
have
unintentionally
made
you
angry
i
ought
to
have
known
that
i
was
treading
on
delicate
ground
your
interest
in
penrose
may
be
due
to
a
warmer
motive
than
a
sense
of
she
turned
away
from
me
sadly
not
angrily
intending
as
it
appeared
to
leave
the
room
in
silence
arrived
at
the
door
she
altered
her
mind
and
came
back
even
if
you
insult
me
bernard
i
am
not
able
to
resent
it
she
said
very
gently
once
wronged
i
have
no
right
to
complain
of
your
now
wronging
me
i
will
try
to
forget
she
held
out
her
hand
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
me
it
was
not
her
fault
i
alone
am
to
blame
in
another
moment
she
was
in
my
arms
i
held
her
to
my
breast
i
felt
the
quick
beating
of
her
heart
on
me
i
poured
out
the
wild
confession
of
my
sorrow
my
shame
my
love
i
tasted
again
and
again
and
again
the
sweetness
of
her
lips
she
put
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
drew
her
head
back
with
a
long
sigh
be
merciful
to
my
weakness
she
whispered
we
must
meet
no
she
pushed
me
back
from
her
with
a
trembling
hand
and
left
the
room
i
have
broken
my
resolution
not
to
write
about
myself
but
there
is
no
egotism
there
is
a
sincere
sense
of
humiliation
in
me
when
i
record
this
confession
of
misconduct
i
can
make
but
one
atonement
i
must
at
once
leave
germain
now
when
it
is
too
late
i
feel
how
hard
for
me
this
life
of
constant
repression
has
been
thus
far
i
had
written
when
the
nursemaid
brought
me
a
little
note
addressed
in
pencil
no
answer
was
required
the
few
lines
were
in
stella
s
handwriting
you
must
not
leave
us
too
suddenly
or
you
may
excite
my
mother
s
suspicions
wait
until
you
receive
letters
from
england
and
make
them
the
pretext
for
your
i
never
thought
of
her
mother
she
is
right
even
if
she
were
wrong
i
must
obey
her
september
the
letters
from
england
have
arrived
one
of
them
presents
me
with
the
necessary
excuse
for
my
departure
ready
made
my
proposal
for
the
purchase
of
the
yacht
is
accepted
the
and
crew
have
refused
all
offers
of
engagement
and
are
waiting
at
cowes
for
my
orders
here
is
an
absolute
necessity
for
my
return
to
england
the
newspaper
arrived
with
the
letters
my
anticipations
have
been
realized
yesterday
s
paragraph
has
produced
another
volunteer
contributor
an
englishman
just
returned
from
central
america
after
traveling
in
arizona
writes
to
the
he
publishes
his
name
and
address
and
he
declares
that
he
has
himself
seen
the
two
captive
priests
the
name
of
this
correspondent
carries
its
own
guarantee
with
it
he
is
no
less
a
person
than
murthwaite
the
traveler
in
india
who
discovered
the
lost
diamond
called
the
moonstone
set
in
the
forehead
of
a
hindoo
idol
he
writes
to
the
editor
as
follows
sir
i
can
tell
you
something
of
the
two
jesuit
priests
who
were
the
sole
survivors
of
the
massacre
in
the
santa
cruz
valley
four
months
since
i
was
traveling
at
the
time
in
arizona
under
the
protection
of
an
apache
chief
bribed
to
show
me
his
country
and
his
nation
instead
of
cutting
my
throat
and
tearing
off
my
scalp
by
a
present
tribute
of
whisky
and
gunpowder
and
by
the
promise
of
more
when
our
association
came
to
an
end
about
twelve
miles
northward
of
the
little
town
of
tubac
we
came
upon
an
apache
encampment
i
at
once
discovered
two
white
men
among
the
indians
these
were
the
captive
priests
one
of
them
was
a
frenchman
named
l
herbier
the
other
was
an
englishman
named
penrose
they
owed
their
lives
to
the
influence
of
two
powerful
considerations
among
the
indians
unhappy
l
herbier
lost
his
senses
under
the
horror
of
the
night
massacre
insanity
as
you
may
have
heard
is
a
sacred
thing
in
the
estimation
of
the
american
savages
they
regard
this
poor
madman
as
a
mysteriously
inspired
person
the
other
priest
penrose
had
been
in
charge
of
the
mission
and
had
successfully
treated
cases
of
illness
among
the
apaches
as
a
great
he
too
is
a
privileged
person
under
the
strong
protection
of
their
interest
in
their
own
health
the
lives
of
the
prisoners
are
in
no
danger
provided
they
can
endure
the
hardship
of
their
wandering
existence
among
the
indians
penrose
spoke
to
me
with
the
resignation
of
a
true
hero
i
am
in
the
hands
of
god
he
said
and
if
i
die
i
die
in
god
s
i
was
entirely
unprovided
with
the
means
of
ransoming
the
missionaries
and
nothing
that
i
could
say
or
that
i
could
promise
had
the
smallest
effect
on
the
savages
but
for
severe
and
tedious
illness
i
should
long
since
have
been
on
my
way
back
to
arizona
with
the
necessary
ransom
as
it
is
i
am
barely
strong
enough
to
write
this
letter
but
i
can
head
a
subscription
to
pay
expenses
and
i
can
give
instructions
to
any
person
who
is
willing
to
attempt
the
deliverance
of
the
so
the
letter
ended
before
i
had
read
it
i
was
at
a
loss
to
know
where
to
go
or
what
to
do
when
i
leave
germain
i
am
now
at
no
loss
i
have
found
an
object
in
life
and
a
means
of
making
atonement
to
stella
for
my
own
ungracious
and
unworthy
words
already
i
have
communicated
by
telegraph
with
murthwaite
and
with
my
the
first
is
informed
that
i
hope
to
be
with
him
in
london
morning
the
second
is
instructed
to
have
the
yacht
fitted
out
immediately
for
a
long
voyage
if
i
can
save
these
men
especially
penrose
i
shall
not
have
lived
in
vain
london
september
no
i
have
resolution
enough
to
go
to
arizona
but
i
have
no
courage
to
record
the
parting
scene
when
it
was
time
to
say
i
had
intended
to
keep
the
coming
enterprise
a
secret
and
only
to
make
the
disclosure
in
writing
when
the
vessel
was
ready
to
sail
but
after
reading
the
letter
to
the
stella
saw
something
in
my
face
as
i
suppose
that
betrayed
me
well
it
s
over
now
i
do
my
best
to
keep
myself
from
thinking
of
it
and
for
this
reason
i
abstain
from
dwelling
on
the
subject
here
murthwaite
has
not
only
given
me
valuable
instructions
he
has
provided
me
with
letters
of
introduction
to
persons
in
office
and
to
the
or
priests
in
mexico
which
will
be
of
incalculable
use
in
such
an
expedition
as
mine
in
the
present
disturbed
condition
of
the
united
states
he
recommends
me
to
sail
for
a
port
on
the
eastern
coast
of
mexico
and
then
to
travel
northward
overland
and
make
my
first
inquiries
in
arizona
at
the
town
of
tubac
time
is
of
such
importance
in
his
opinion
that
he
suggests
making
inquiries
in
london
and
liverpool
for
a
merchant
vessel
under
immediate
sailing
orders
for
vera
cruz
or
tampico
the
fitting
out
of
the
yacht
can
not
be
accomplished
i
find
in
less
than
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
i
have
therefore
taken
murthwaite
s
advice
september
no
favorable
answer
so
far
as
the
port
of
london
is
concerned
very
little
commerce
with
mexico
and
bad
harbors
in
that
country
when
you
do
trade
such
is
the
report
september
a
mexican
brig
has
been
discovered
at
liverpool
under
orders
for
vera
cruz
but
the
vessel
is
in
debt
and
the
date
of
departure
depends
on
expected
remittances
in
this
state
of
things
i
may
wait
with
my
conscience
at
ease
to
sail
in
comfort
on
board
my
own
schooner
september
i
have
settled
my
affairs
i
have
taken
leave
of
my
friends
good
murthwaite
included
i
have
written
cheerfully
to
stella
and
i
sail
from
portsmouth
well
provided
with
the
jars
of
whisky
and
the
kegs
of
gunpowder
which
will
effect
the
release
of
the
captives
it
is
strange
considering
the
serious
matters
i
have
to
think
of
but
it
is
also
true
that
i
feel
out
of
spirits
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
england
without
my
traveling
companion
the
dog
i
am
afraid
to
take
the
dear
old
fellow
with
me
on
such
a
perilous
expedition
as
mine
may
be
stella
takes
care
of
him
and
if
i
don
t
live
to
return
she
will
never
part
with
him
for
his
master
s
sake
it
implies
a
childish
sort
of
mind
i
suppose
but
it
is
a
comfort
to
me
to
remember
that
i
have
never
said
a
hard
word
to
traveler
and
never
lifted
my
hand
on
him
in
anger
all
this
about
a
dog
and
not
a
word
about
stella
not
a
word
thoughts
are
not
to
be
written
i
have
reached
the
last
page
of
my
diary
i
shall
lock
it
and
leave
it
in
charge
of
my
bankers
on
my
way
to
the
portsmouth
train
shall
i
ever
want
a
new
diary
superstitious
people
might
associate
this
coming
to
the
end
of
the
book
with
coming
to
an
end
of
another
kind
i
have
no
imagination
and
i
take
my
leap
in
the
dark
hopefully
with
byron
s
glorious
lines
in
my
mind
here
s
a
sigh
to
those
who
love
me
and
a
smile
to
those
that
hate
and
whatever
sky
s
above
met
here
s
heart
for
every
an
inclosure
is
inserted
here
marking
a
lapse
of
seven
months
before
the
entries
in
the
diary
are
resumed
it
consists
of
two
telegrams
dispatched
respectively
on
the
and
of

safe
on
board
my
yacht
his
unfortunate
companion
has
died
of
exhaustion
and
he
is
himself
in
a
feeble
state
of
health
i
at
once
take
him
with
me
to
london
for
medical
advice
we
are
eager
for
news
of

winterfield
derwent

hotel
your
telegram
received
with
joy
and
sent
on
to
stella
in
paris
all
well
but
strange
events
have
happened
if
you
can
not
come
here
at
once
go
to
lord
loring
he
will
tell
you
tenth
extract
london
may
mrs
eyrecourt
s
telegram
reached
me
just
after
doctor
wybrow
had
paid
his
first
professional
visit
to
penrose
at
the
hotel
i
had
hardly
time
to
feel
relieved
by
the
opinion
of
the
case
which
he
expressed
before
my
mind
was
upset
by
eyrecourt
leaving
penrose
under
the
charge
of
our
excellent
landlady
i
hurried
away
to
lord
loring
it
was
still
early
in
the
day
his
lordship
was
at
home
he
maddened
me
with
impatience
by
apologizing
at
full
length
for
the
inexcusable
manner
in
which
he
had
misinterpreted
my
conduct
on
the
deplorable
occasion
of
the
marriage
ceremony
at
i
stopped
his
flow
of
words
very
earnestly
spoken
it
is
only
right
to
add
and
entreated
him
to
tell
me
in
the
first
place
what
stella
was
doing
in
paris
stella
is
with
her
husband
lord
loring
replied
my
head
turned
giddy
my
heart
beat
furiously
lord
loring
looked
at
me
ran
to
the
luncheon
table
in
the
next
room
and
returned
with
a
glass
of
wine
i
really
don
t
know
whether
i
drank
the
wine
or
not
i
know
i
stammered
out
another
inquiry
in
one
word
reconciled
i
said
yes
winterfield
reconciled
before
he
we
were
both
silent
for
a
while
what
was
he
thinking
of
i
don
t
know
what
was
i
thinking
of
i
daren
t
write
it
down
lord
loring
resumed
by
expressing
some
anxiety
on
the
subject
of
my
health
i
made
the
best
excuse
for
myself
that
i
could
and
told
him
of
the
rescue
of
penrose
he
had
heard
of
my
object
in
leaving
england
and
heartily
congratulated
me
this
will
be
welcome
news
indeed
he
said
to
father
even
the
name
of
father
benwell
now
excites
my
distrust
is
in
paris
too
i
inquired
he
left
paris
last
night
lord
loring
answered
and
he
is
now
in
london
on
important
business
as
i
understand
connected
with
romayne
s
i
instantly
thought
of
the
boy
is
romayne
in
possession
of
his
faculties
i
asked
in
complete
while
justice
is
in
his
power
has
he
done
justice
to
his
son
lord
loring
looked
a
little
confused
i
have
not
heard
was
all
he
said
in
reply
i
was
far
from
satisfied
you
are
one
of
romayne
s
oldest
friends
i
persisted
have
you
not
seen
him
yourself
i
have
seen
him
more
than
once
but
he
has
never
referred
to
his
having
said
this
he
hastily
changed
the
subject
is
there
any
other
information
that
i
can
give
you
he
suggested
i
had
still
to
learn
under
what
circumstances
romayne
had
left
italy
for
france
and
how
the
event
of
his
illness
in
paris
had
been
communicated
to
his
wife
lord
loring
had
only
to
draw
on
his
own
recollections
to
enlighten
me
lady
loring
and
i
passed
the
last
winter
in
rome
he
said
and
there
we
saw
romayne
you
look
surprised
perhaps
you
are
aware
that
we
had
offended
him
by
advice
which
we
thought
it
our
duty
to
offer
to
stella
before
her
marriage
i
was
certainly
thinking
of
what
stella
had
said
of
the
lorings
on
the
memorable
day
when
she
visited
me
at
the
hotel
romayne
would
probably
have
refused
to
receive
us
lord
loring
resumed
but
for
the
gratifying
circumstance
of
my
having
been
admitted
to
an
interview
with
the
pope
the
holy
father
spoke
of
him
with
the
most
condescending
kindness
and
hearing
that
i
had
not
yet
seen
him
gave
instructions
commanding
romayne
to
present
himself
under
these
circumstances
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
refuse
to
receive
lady
loring
and
myself
on
a
later
occasion
i
can
not
tell
you
how
distressed
we
were
at
the
sad
change
for
the
worse
in
his
personal
appearance
the
italian
physician
whom
he
occasionally
consulted
told
me
that
there
was
a
weakness
in
the
action
of
his
heart
produced
in
the
first
instance
by
excessive
study
and
the
excitement
of
preaching
and
aggravated
by
the
further
drain
on
his
strength
due
to
insufficient
nourishment
he
would
eat
and
drink
just
enough
to
keep
him
alive
and
no
more
and
he
persistently
refused
to
try
the
good
influence
of
rest
and
change
of
scene
my
wife
at
a
later
interview
with
him
when
they
were
alone
induced
him
to
throw
aside
the
reserve
which
he
had
maintained
with
me
and
discovered
another
cause
for
the
deterioration
in
his
health
i
don
t
refer
to
the
return
of
a
nervous
misery
from
which
he
has
suffered
at
intervals
for
years
past
i
speak
of
the
effect
produced
on
his
mind
by
the
announcement
made
no
doubt
with
best
intentions
by
doctor
wybrow
of
the
birth
of
his
child
this
disclosure
he
was
entirely
ignorant
of
his
wife
s
situation
when
he
left
her
appears
to
have
affected
him
far
more
seriously
than
the
english
doctor
supposed
lady
loring
was
so
shocked
at
what
he
said
to
her
on
the
subject
that
she
has
only
repeated
it
to
me
with
a
certain
reserve
if
i
could
believe
i
did
wrong
he
said
in
dedicating
myself
to
the
service
of
the
church
after
the
overthrow
of
my
domestic
happiness
i
should
also
believe
that
the
birth
of
this
child
was
the
retributive
punishment
of
my
sin
and
the
warning
of
my
approaching
death
i
dare
not
take
this
view
and
yet
i
have
it
not
in
me
after
the
solemn
vows
by
which
i
am
bound
to
place
any
more
consoling
interpretation
on
an
event
which
as
a
priest
it
disturbs
and
humiliates
me
even
to
think
that
one
revelation
of
his
tone
of
thought
will
tell
you
what
is
the
mental
state
of
this
unhappy
man
he
gave
us
little
encouragement
to
continue
our
friendly
intercourse
with
him
it
was
only
when
we
were
thinking
of
our
return
to
england
that
we
heard
of
his
appointment
to
the
vacant
place
of
first
attache
to
the
embassy
at
paris
the
pope
s
paternal
anxiety
on
the
subject
of
romayne
s
health
had
chosen
this
wise
and
generous
method
of
obliging
him
to
try
a
salutary
change
of
air
as
well
as
a
relaxation
from
his
incessant
employments
in
rome
on
the
occasion
of
his
departure
we
met
again
he
looked
like
a
old
man
we
could
now
only
remember
his
double
claim
on
us
as
a
priest
of
our
religion
and
as
a
once
dear
friend
and
we
arranged
to
travel
with
him
the
weather
at
the
time
was
mild
our
progress
was
made
by
easy
stages
we
left
him
at
paris
apparently
the
better
for
his
i
asked
if
they
had
seen
stella
on
that
occasion
no
said
lord
loring
we
had
reason
to
doubt
whether
stella
would
be
pleased
to
see
us
and
we
felt
reluctant
to
meddle
unasked
with
a
matter
of
extreme
delicacy
i
arranged
with
the
nuncio
whom
i
have
the
honor
to
know
that
we
should
receive
written
information
of
romayne
s
state
of
health
and
on
that
understanding
we
returned
to
england
a
week
since
our
news
from
the
embassy
was
so
alarming
that
lady
loring
at
once
returned
to
paris
her
first
letter
informed
me
that
she
had
felt
it
her
duty
to
tell
stella
of
the
critical
condition
of
romayne
s
health
she
expressed
her
sense
of
my
wife
s
kindness
most
gratefully
and
feelingly
and
at
once
removed
to
paris
to
be
on
the
spot
if
her
husband
expressed
a
wish
to
see
her
the
two
ladies
are
now
staying
at
the
same
hotel
i
have
thus
far
been
detained
in
london
by
family
affairs
but
unless
i
hear
of
a
change
for
the
better
before
evening
i
follow
lady
loring
to
paris
by
the
mail
it
was
needless
to
trespass
further
on
lord
loring
s
time
i
thanked
him
and
returned
to
penrose
he
was
sleeping
when
i
got
to
the
hotel
on
the
table
in
the
i
found
a
telegram
waiting
for
me
it
had
been
sent
by
stella
and
it
contained
these
lines
i
have
just
returned
from
his
bedside
after
telling
him
of
the
rescue
of
penrose
he
desires
to
see
you
there
is
no
positive
suffering
he
is
sinking
under
a
complete
prostration
of
the
forces
of
life
that
is
what
the
doctors
tell
me
they
said
when
i
spoke
of
writing
to
you
send
a
telegram
there
is
no
time
to
toward
evening
penrose
awoke
i
showed
him
the
telegram
throughout
our
voyage
the
prospect
of
seeing
romayne
again
had
been
the
uppermost
subject
in
his
thoughts
in
the
extremity
of
his
distress
he
declared
that
he
would
accompany
me
to
paris
by
the
night
train
remembering
how
severely
he
had
felt
the
fatigue
of
the
short
railway
journey
from
portsmouth
i
entreated
him
to
let
me
go
alone
his
devotion
to
romayne
was
not
to
be
reasoned
with
while
we
were
still
vainly
trying
to
convince
each
other
doctor
wybrow
came
in
to
my
amazement
he
sided
with
penrose
oh
get
up
by
all
means
he
said
we
will
help
you
to
we
took
him
out
of
bed
and
put
on
his
he
thanked
us
and
saying
he
would
complete
his
toilet
by
himself
sat
down
in
an
easy
chair
in
another
moment
he
was
asleep
again
so
soundly
asleep
that
we
put
him
back
in
his
bed
without
waking
him
doctor
wybrow
had
foreseen
this
result
he
looked
at
the
poor
fellow
s
pale
peaceful
face
with
a
kindly
smile
there
is
the
treatment
he
said
that
will
set
our
patient
on
his
legs
again
sleeping
eating
and
drinking
let
that
be
his
life
for
some
weeks
to
come
and
he
will
be
as
good
a
man
as
ever
if
your
homeward
journey
had
been
by
land
penrose
would
have
died
on
the
way
i
will
take
care
of
him
while
you
are
in
at
the
station
i
met
lord
loring
he
understood
that
i
too
had
received
bad
news
and
gave
me
a
place
in
the
carriage
which
had
been
reserved
for
him
we
had
hardly
taken
our
seats
when
we
saw
father
benwell
among
the
travelers
on
the
platform
accompanied
by
a
gentleman
who
was
a
stranger
to
both
of
us
lord
loring
dislikes
strangers
otherwise
i
might
have
found
myself
traveling
to
paris
with
that
detestable
jesuit
for
a
companion
paris
may
on
our
arrival
at
the
hotel
i
was
informed
that
no
message
had
yet
been
received
from
the
embassy
we
found
lady
loring
alone
at
the
when
we
had
rested
after
our
night
journey
romayne
still
lives
she
said
but
his
voice
has
sunk
to
a
whisper
and
he
is
unable
to
breathe
if
he
tries
to
rest
in
bed
stella
has
gone
to
the
embassy
she
hopes
to
see
him
for
the
second
only
for
the
second
time
i
exclaimed
you
forget
winterfield
that
romayne
is
a
priest
he
was
only
consecrated
on
the
customary
condition
of
an
absolute
separation
from
his
wife
on
her
side
never
let
her
know
that
i
told
you
this
stella
signed
a
formal
document
sent
from
rome
asserting
that
she
consented
of
her
own
free
will
to
the
separation
she
was
relieved
from
the
performance
of
another
formality
which
i
need
not
mention
more
particularly
by
a
special
dispensation
under
these
circumstances
communicated
to
me
while
stella
and
i
have
been
together
in
this
house
the
wife
s
presence
at
the
bedside
of
her
dying
husband
is
regarded
by
the
other
priests
at
the
embassy
as
a
scandal
and
a
profanation
the
nuncio
is
blamed
for
having
exceeded
his
powers
in
yielding
even
under
protest
to
the
last
wishes
of
a
dying
man
he
is
now
in
communication
with
rome
waiting
for
the
final
instructions
which
are
to
guide
has
romayne
seen
his
child
i
asked
stella
has
taken
the
child
with
her
it
is
doubtful
in
the
last
degree
whether
the
poor
little
boy
will
be
allowed
to
enter
his
father
s
room
complication
is
even
more
serious
than
the
other
the
dying
romayne
persists
in
his
resolution
to
see
the
child
so
completely
has
his
way
of
thinking
been
altered
by
the
approach
of
death
and
by
the
closing
of
the
brilliant
prospect
which
was
before
him
that
he
even
threatens
to
recant
with
his
last
breath
if
his
wishes
are
not
complied
with
how
it
will
end
i
can
not
even
venture
to
guess
unless
the
merciful
course
taken
by
the
nuncio
is
confirmed
said
lord
loring
it
may
end
in
a
revival
of
the
protest
of
the
catholic
priests
in
germany
against
the
prohibition
of
marriage
to
the
clergy
the
movement
began
in
silesia
in
and
was
followed
by
unions
or
leagues
as
we
should
call
them
now
in
baden
wurtemburg
bavaria
and
rhenish
prussia
later
still
the
agitation
spread
to
france
and
austria
it
was
only
checked
by
a
papal
bull
issued
in
reiterating
the
final
decision
of
the
famous
council
of
trent
in
favor
of
the
celibacy
of
the
priesthood
few
people
are
aware
that
this
rule
has
been
an
institution
of
slow
growth
among
the
clergy
of
the
church
of
rome
even
as
late
as
the
twelfth
century
there
were
still
priests
who
set
the
prohibition
of
marriage
at
i
listened
as
one
of
the
many
ignorant
persons
alluded
to
by
lord
loring
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
fixed
my
attention
on
what
he
was
saying
my
thoughts
wandered
to
stella
and
to
the
dying
man
i
looked
at
the
clock
lady
loring
evidently
shared
the
feeling
of
suspense
that
had
got
possession
of
me
she
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
here
is
the
message
she
said
recognizing
her
traveling
servant
as
he
entered
the
hotel
door
the
man
appeared
with
a
line
written
on
a
card
i
was
requested
to
present
the
card
at
the
embassy
without
delay
may
i
am
only
now
able
to
continue
my
record
of
the
events
of
yesterday
a
silent
servant
received
me
at
the
embassy
looked
at
the
card
and
led
the
way
to
an
upper
floor
of
the
house
arrived
at
the
end
of
a
long
passage
he
opened
a
door
and
retired
as
i
crossed
the
threshold
stella
met
me
she
took
both
my
hands
in
hers
and
looked
at
me
in
silence
all
that
was
true
and
good
and
noble
expressed
itself
in
that
look
the
interval
passed
and
she
spoke
very
sadly
very
quietly
one
more
work
of
mercy
bernard
help
him
to
die
with
a
heart
at
she
drew
back
and
i
approached
him
he
reclined
propped
up
with
pillows
in
a
large
it
was
the
one
position
in
which
he
could
still
breathe
with
freedom
the
ashy
shades
of
death
were
on
his
wasted
face
in
the
eyes
alone
as
they
slowly
turned
on
me
there
still
glimmered
the
waning
light
of
life
one
of
his
arms
hung
down
over
the
chair
the
other
was
clasped
round
his
child
sitting
on
his
knee
the
boy
looked
at
me
wonderingly
as
i
stood
by
his
father
romayne
signed
to
me
to
stoop
so
that
i
might
hear
him
penrose
he
asked
faintly
whispering
dear
arthur
not
dying
like
me
i
quieted
anxiety
for
a
moment
there
was
even
the
shadow
of
a
smile
on
his
face
as
i
told
him
of
the
effort
that
penrose
had
vainly
made
to
be
the
companion
of
my
journey
he
asked
me
by
another
gesture
to
bend
my
ear
to
him
once
more
my
last
grateful
blessing
to
penrose
and
to
you
may
i
not
say
it
you
have
saved
arthur
his
eyes
turned
toward
stella
you
have
been
best
he
paused
to
recover
his
feeble
breath
looking
round
the
large
room
without
a
creature
in
it
but
ourselves
once
more
the
melancholy
shadow
of
a
smile
passed
over
his
face
and
vanished
i
listened
nearer
to
him
still
christ
took
a
child
on
his
knee
the
priests
call
themselves
ministers
of
christ
they
have
left
me
because
of
child
here
on
my
knee
wrong
wrong
wrong
winterfield
death
is
a
great
teacher
i
know
how
i
have
erred
what
i
have
lost
wife
and
child
how
poor
and
barren
all
the
rest
of
it
looks
now
he
was
silent
for
a
while
was
he
thinking
no
he
seemed
to
be
listening
and
yet
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
stella
anxiously
watching
him
saw
the
listening
expression
as
i
did
her
face
showed
anxiety
but
no
surprise
does
it
torture
you
still
she
asked
no
he
said
i
have
never
heard
it
plainly
since
i
left
rome
it
has
grown
fainter
and
fainter
from
that
time
it
is
not
a
voice
now
it
is
hardly
a
whisper
my
repentance
is
accepted
my
release
is
where
is
winterfield
she
pointed
to
me
i
spoke
of
rome
just
now
what
did
rome
remind
me
of
he
slowly
recovered
the
lost
recollection
tell
winterfield
he
whispered
to
stella
what
the
nuncio
said
when
he
knew
that
i
was
going
to
die
the
great
man
reckoned
up
the
dignities
that
might
have
been
mine
if
i
had
lived
from
my
place
here
in
the
embassy
let
me
say
it
she
gently
interposed
and
spare
your
strength
for
better
things
from
your
place
in
the
embassy
you
would
have
mounted
a
step
higher
to
the
office
of
those
duties
wisely
performed
another
rise
to
the
auditorship
of
the
apostolic
chamber
that
office
filled
a
last
step
upward
to
the
highest
rank
left
the
rank
of
a
prince
of
the
all
vanity
said
the
dying
romayne
he
looked
at
his
wife
and
his
child
the
true
happiness
was
waiting
for
me
here
and
i
only
know
it
now
too
late
too
he
laid
his
head
back
on
the
pillow
and
closed
his
weary
eyes
we
thought
he
was
composing
himself
to
sleep
stella
tried
to
relieve
him
of
the
boy
no
he
whispered
i
am
only
resting
my
eyes
to
look
at
him
we
waited
the
child
stared
at
me
in
infantine
curiosity
his
mother
knelt
at
his
side
and
whispered
in
his
ear
a
bright
smile
irradiated
his
face
his
clear
brown
eyes
sparkled
he
repeated
the
forgotten
lesson
of
the
bygone
time
and
called
me
once
more
uncle
ber
romayne
heard
it
his
heavy
eyelids
opened
again
no
he
said
not
uncle
something
better
and
dearer
stella
give
me
your
still
kneeling
she
obeyed
him
he
slowly
raised
himself
on
the
chair
take
her
hand
he
said
to
me
i
too
knelt
her
hand
lay
cold
in
mine
after
a
long
interval
he
spoke
to
me
bernard
winterfield
he
said
love
them
and
help
them
when
i
am
he
laid
his
weak
hand
on
our
hands
clasped
together
may
god
protect
you
may
god
bless
you
he
murmured
kiss
me
i
remember
no
more
as
a
man
i
ought
to
have
set
a
better
example
i
ought
to
have
preserved
my
it
was
not
to
be
done
i
turned
away
from
them
and
burst
out
crying
the
minutes
passed
many
minutes
or
few
minutes
i
don
t
know
which
a
soft
knock
at
the
door
aroused
me
i
dashed
away
the
useless
tears
stella
had
retired
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
she
was
sitting
by
the
fireside
with
the
child
in
her
arms
i
withdrew
to
the
same
part
of
the
room
keeping
far
enough
away
not
to
disturb
them
two
strangers
came
in
and
placed
themselves
on
either
side
of
romayne
s
chair
he
seemed
to
recognize
them
unwillingly
from
the
manner
in
which
they
examined
him
i
inferred
that
they
were
medical
men
after
a
consultation
in
low
tones
one
of
them
went
out
he
returned
again
almost
immediately
followed
by
the
gentleman
whom
i
had
noticed
on
the
journey
to
paris
and
by
father
benwell
the
jesuit
s
vigilant
eyes
discovered
us
instantly
in
our
place
near
the
fireside
i
thought
i
saw
suspicion
as
well
as
surprise
in
his
face
but
he
recovered
himself
so
rapidly
that
i
could
not
feel
sure
he
bowed
to
stella
she
made
no
return
she
looked
as
if
she
had
not
even
seen
him
one
of
the
doctors
was
an
englishman
he
said
to
father
benwell
whatever
your
business
may
be
with
romayne
we
advise
you
to
enter
on
it
without
delay
shall
we
leave
the
room
certainly
not
father
benwell
answered
the
more
witnesses
are
present
the
more
relieved
i
shall
he
turned
to
his
traveling
companion
let
romayne
s
lawyer
he
resumed
state
what
our
business
the
gentleman
stepped
forward
are
you
able
to
attend
to
me
sir
he
asked
romayne
reclining
in
his
chair
apparently
lost
to
all
interest
in
what
was
going
on
heard
and
answered
the
weak
tones
of
his
voice
failed
to
reach
my
ear
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
the
lawyer
seeming
to
be
satisfied
so
far
put
a
formal
question
to
the
doctors
next
he
inquired
if
romayne
was
in
full
possession
of
his
faculties
both
the
physicians
answered
without
hesitation
in
the
affirmative
father
benwell
added
attestation
throughout
romayne
s
illness
he
said
firmly
his
mind
has
been
as
clear
as
mine
while
this
was
going
on
the
child
had
slipped
off
his
mother
s
lap
with
the
natural
restlessness
of
his
age
he
walked
to
the
fireplace
and
stopped
fascinated
by
the
bright
red
glow
of
the
embers
of
burning
wood
in
one
corner
of
the
low
fender
lay
a
loose
little
bundle
of
sticks
left
there
in
case
the
fire
might
need
relighting
the
boy
noticing
the
bundle
took
out
one
of
the
sticks
and
threw
it
experimentally
into
the
grate
the
flash
of
flame
as
the
stick
caught
fire
delighted
him
he
went
on
burning
stick
after
stick
the
new
game
kept
him
quiet
his
mother
was
content
to
be
on
the
watch
to
see
that
no
harm
was
done
in
the
meantime
the
lawyer
briefly
stated
his
case
you
remember
romayne
that
your
will
was
placed
for
safe
keeping
in
our
office
he
began
father
benwell
called
upon
us
and
presented
an
order
signed
by
yourself
authorizing
him
to
convey
the
will
from
london
to
paris
the
object
was
to
obtain
your
signature
to
a
codicil
which
had
been
considered
a
necessary
addition
to
secure
the
validity
of
the
are
you
favoring
me
with
your
attention
sir
romayne
answered
by
a
slight
bending
of
his
head
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
boy
still
absorbed
in
throwing
his
sticks
one
by
one
into
the
fire
at
the
time
when
your
will
was
executed
the
lawyer
went
on
father
benwell
obtained
your
permission
to
take
a
copy
of
it
hearing
of
your
illness
he
submitted
the
copy
to
a
high
legal
authority
the
written
opinion
of
this
competent
person
declares
the
clause
bequeathing
the
vange
estate
to
father
benwell
to
be
so
imperfectly
expressed
that
the
will
might
be
made
a
subject
of
litigation
after
the
testator
s
death
he
has
accordingly
appended
a
form
of
codicil
amending
the
defect
and
we
have
added
it
to
the
will
i
thought
it
my
duty
as
one
of
your
legal
advisers
to
accompany
father
benwell
on
his
return
to
paris
in
charge
of
the
will
in
case
you
might
feel
disposed
to
make
any
he
looked
toward
stella
and
the
child
as
he
completed
that
sentence
the
jesuit
s
keen
eyes
took
the
same
direction
shall
i
read
the
will
sir
the
lawyer
resumed
or
would
you
prefer
to
look
at
it
yourself
romayne
held
out
his
hand
for
the
will
in
silence
he
was
still
watching
his
son
there
were
but
few
more
sticks
now
left
to
be
thrown
in
the
fire
father
benwell
interfered
for
the
first
time
one
word
romayne
before
you
examine
that
document
he
said
the
church
receives
back
from
you
through
me
the
property
which
was
once
its
own
beyond
that
it
authorizes
and
even
desires
you
to
make
any
changes
which
you
or
your
trusted
legal
adviser
may
think
right
i
refer
to
the
clauses
of
the
will
which
relate
to
the
property
you
have
inherited
from
the
late
lady
berrick
and
i
beg
the
persons
present
to
bear
in
memory
the
few
plain
words
that
i
have
now
he
bowed
with
dignity
and
drew
back
even
the
lawyer
was
favorably
impressed
the
doctors
looked
at
each
other
with
silent
approval
for
the
first
time
the
sad
repose
of
stella
s
face
was
disturbed
i
could
see
that
it
cost
her
an
effort
to
repress
her
indignation
the
one
unmoved
person
was
romayne
the
sheet
of
paper
on
which
the
will
was
written
lay
unregarded
upon
his
lap
his
eyes
were
still
riveted
on
the
little
figure
at
the
fireplace
the
child
had
thrown
his
last
stick
into
the
glowing
red
embers
he
looked
about
him
for
a
fresh
supply
and
found
nothing
his
fresh
young
voice
rose
high
through
the
silence
of
the
room
more
he
cried
more
his
mother
held
up
a
warning
finger
hush
she
whispered
he
shrank
away
from
her
as
she
tried
to
take
him
on
her
knee
and
looked
across
the
room
at
his
father
more
he
burst
out
louder
than
ever
romayne
beckoned
to
me
and
pointed
to
the
boy
i
led
him
across
the
room
he
was
quite
willing
to
go
with
me
he
reiterated
his
petition
standing
at
his
father
s
knees
lift
him
to
me
said
romayne
i
could
barely
hear
the
words
even
his
strength
to
whisper
seemed
to
be
fast
leaving
him
he
kissed
his
son
with
a
panting
fatigue
under
that
trifling
exertion
pitiable
to
see
as
i
placed
the
boy
on
his
feet
again
he
looked
up
at
his
dying
father
with
the
one
idea
still
in
his
mind
more
papa
more
romayne
put
the
will
into
his
hand
the
child
s
eyes
sparkled
burn
he
asked
eagerly
yes
father
benwell
sprang
forward
with
outstretched
hands
i
stopped
him
he
struggled
with
me
i
forgot
the
privilege
of
the
black
robe
i
took
him
by
the
throat
the
boy
threw
the
will
into
the
fire
oh
he
shouted
in
high
delight
and
clapped
his
chubby
hands
as
the
bright
little
blaze
flew
up
the
chimney
i
released
the
priest
in
a
frenzy
of
rage
and
despair
he
looked
round
at
the
persons
in
the
room
i
take
you
all
to
witness
he
cried
this
is
an
act
of
madness
you
yourself
declared
just
now
said
the
lawyer
that
romayne
was
in
perfect
possession
of
his
the
baffled
jesuit
turned
furiously
on
the
dying
man
they
looked
at
each
other
for
one
awful
moment
romayne
s
eyes
brightened
romayne
s
voice
rallied
its
power
as
if
life
was
returning
to
him
frowning
darkly
the
priest
put
his
question
what
did
you
do
it
for
quietly
and
firmly
the
answer
came
wife
and
the
last
sigh
rose
and
fell
with
those
sacred
words
on
his
lips
romayne
died
london
at
stella
s
request
i
have
returned
to
penrose
with
but
one
my
dear
old
companion
the
dog
is
coiled
up
fast
asleep
at
my
feet
while
i
write
these
lines
penrose
has
gained
strength
enough
to
keep
me
company
in
the
in
a
few
days
more
he
will
see
stella
again
what
instructions
reached
the
embassy
from
rome
whether
romayne
received
the
last
sacrament
at
the
earlier
period
of
his
illness
we
never
heard
no
objection
was
made
when
lord
loring
proposed
to
remove
the
body
to
england
to
be
buried
in
the
family
vault
at
vange
abbey
i
had
undertaken
to
give
the
necessary
directions
for
the
funeral
on
my
arrival
in
london
returning
to
the
hotel
i
met
father
benwell
in
the
street
i
tried
to
pass
on
he
deliberately
stopped
me
how
is
romayne
he
asked
with
that
infernal
suavity
which
he
seems
always
to
have
at
command
fairly
well
i
hope
and
the
boy
ah
he
little
thought
how
he
was
changing
his
prospects
for
the
better
when
he
made
that
blaze
in
the
fire
pardon
me
winterfield
you
don
t
seem
to
be
quite
so
cordial
as
usual
perhaps
you
are
thinking
of
your
inconsiderate
assault
on
my
throat
let
us
forgive
and
forget
or
perhaps
you
object
to
my
having
converted
poor
romayne
and
to
my
being
ready
to
accept
from
him
the
restoration
of
the
property
of
the
church
in
both
cases
i
only
did
my
duty
as
a
priest
you
are
a
man
surely
i
deserve
a
favorable
construction
of
my
conduct
i
really
could
not
endure
this
i
have
my
own
opinion
of
what
you
deserve
i
answered
don
t
provoke
me
to
mention
he
eyed
me
with
a
sinister
smile
i
am
not
so
old
as
i
look
he
said
i
may
live
another
twenty
years
well
i
asked
well
he
answered
much
may
happen
in
twenty
years
with
that
he
left
me
if
he
means
any
further
mischief
i
can
tell
him
this
he
will
find
me
in
his
way
to
turn
to
a
more
pleasant
subject
reflecting
on
all
that
had
passed
at
my
memorable
interview
with
romayne
i
felt
some
surprise
that
one
of
the
persons
present
had
made
no
effort
to
prevent
the
burning
of
the
will
it
was
not
to
be
expected
of
stella
or
of
the
doctors
who
had
no
interest
in
the
matter
but
i
was
unable
to
understand
the
passive
position
maintained
by
the
lawyer
he
enlightened
my
ignorance
in
two
words
the
vange
property
and
the
berrick
property
were
both
absolutely
at
the
disposal
of
romayne
he
said
if
he
died
without
leaving
a
will
he
knew
enough
of
the
law
to
foresee
that
houses
lands
and
money
would
go
to
his
nearest
of
in
plainer
words
his
widow
and
his
when
penrose
can
travel
he
accompanies
me
to
beaupark
stella
and
her
little
son
and
eyrecourt
will
be
the
only
other
guests
in
my
house
time
must
pass
and
the
boy
will
be
older
before
i
may
remind
stella
of
romayne
s
last
wishes
on
that
sad
morning
when
we
two
knelt
on
either
side
of
him
in
the
meanwhile
it
is
almost
happiness
enough
for
me
to
look
forward
to
the
day
the
next
leaf
of
the
diary
is
missing
by
some
accident
a
manuscript
page
has
got
into
its
place
bearing
a
later
date
and
containing
elaborate
instructions
for
executing
a
design
for
a
wedding
dress
the
handwriting
has
since
been
acknowledged
as
her
own
by
no
less
a
person
than
eyrecourt
